04:03.285 --> 04:05.411
Holà!

04:05.495 --> 04:09.457
Don't tell me.
Ya didn't know it was loaded.

04:09.541 --> 04:12.752
- Sylvie!
- Oh.

04:12.836 --> 04:16.130
Can't he do something constructive,
like start an avalanche or something?

04:16.214 --> 04:18.298
Va jouer, mon chéri.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.887
When you start to eat like this,
something is the matter.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.808
Sylvie, I'm getting a divorce.

04:27.893 --> 04:32.104
- What? From Charles?
- He's the only husband I have.

04:32.189 --> 04:37.068
- I've tried to make it work, really I have, but -
- But what?

04:37.152 --> 04:40.696
I can't explain. It's just that I'm too miserable
to go on any longer like this.

04:43.033 --> 04:46.869
It is infuriating that your unhappiness
does not turn to fat.

04:49.498 --> 04:53.167
But I don't understand.
Why do you want a divorce?

04:53.251 --> 04:56.128
Because I don't love him.
And he obviously doesn't love me.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.714
That's no reason to get a divorce.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.841
With a rich husband
and this year's clothes...

05:00.926 --> 05:03.719
you won't find it difficult
to make some new friends.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.389
I admit I came to Paris
to escape American provincial...

05:06.473 --> 05:09.475
but that doesn't mean I'm ready
for French traditional.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.186
I loathe the whole idea
of divorce, Sylvie.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.438
But if only Charles had
been honest with me.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.774
That's all I ask of anybody:
the simple truth.

05:16.858 --> 05:21.570
But with Charles,
everything is secrecy and lies.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.282
He's hiding something
from me, Sylvie -

05:25.367 --> 05:28.869
something terrible -
and it frightens me.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.871
Does he belong to you?

05:30.956 --> 05:33.666
It's hers. Where'd you find him?
Robbing a bank?

05:33.750 --> 05:35.876
He was throwing snowballs
at Baron Rothschild.

05:35.961 --> 05:39.171
- Oh, thank you.
- Do we know each other?

05:39.256 --> 05:42.675
- Why? Do you think we're going to?
- I don't know. How would I know?

05:42.759 --> 05:44.927
Because I already know
an awful lot of people.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.888
Until one of them dies
I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.

05:47.973 --> 05:52.143
Hmm. Well, if anyone goes
on the critical list, let me know.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.186
- Quitter.
- Uh, what?

05:54.271 --> 05:57.314
You give up awfully easily, don't you?

05:57.399 --> 06:01.152
Viens, Jean-Louis. Let us make a walk.
I've never seen a Rothschild before.

06:06.992 --> 06:10.661
Clever fellow. Almost missed me.

06:10.746 --> 06:12.663
Thank you.

06:12.748 --> 06:17.293
- You're blocking my view.
- Oh.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.421
- Which view would you prefer?
- The one you're blocking.

06:20.505 --> 06:23.174
It's my last chance.
I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.676
- What's your name?
- Peter Joshua.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.429
- Mine's Regina Lampert.
- Is there a Mr. Lampert?

06:28.513 --> 06:29.680
- Yes.
- Good for you.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.348
No, it isn't.
I'm getting a divorce.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.560
- Please, not on my account.
- No. I don't really love him.

06:34.644 --> 06:38.189
- At least you're honest.
- Hmm. Is there a Mrs. Joshua?

06:38.273 --> 06:40.566
Yes, but we're divorced.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.943
That wasn't a proposal.
I'm just curious.

06:43.028 --> 06:45.404
Is your husband with you?

06:45.489 --> 06:47.948
Oh, no, Charles is never with me.
What do people call you? Pete?

06:48.033 --> 06:50.451
Mr. Joshua.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.871
- I've enjoyed talking with you.
- Now you're angry.

06:53.955 --> 06:57.291
No, I just have a lot of packing to do.
I'm going back to Paris, too.

06:57.375 --> 07:00.336
Wasn't it Shakespeare who said
when strangers do meet in far-off lands...

07:00.420 --> 07:02.379
they should ere long
see each other again?

07:02.464 --> 07:05.591
- Shakespeare never said that.
- How do you know?

07:05.675 --> 07:07.635
It's terrible.
You just made it up.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.637
Well, it sounds right.
You going to call me?

07:09.721 --> 07:12.014
- Are you in the book?
- Well, Charles is.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.225
- Is there only one Charles Lampert?
- Mmm.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.729
Lord, I hope so.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.326
Good-bye, Sylvie, and thanks.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.829
When you get your divorce,
are you going back to America?

07:34.913 --> 07:39.750
- Don't you want me to stay?
- Of course, but if you went
back and wrote me a letter -

07:39.835 --> 07:42.503
You could have the stamps.
I'll get you some here, okay?

07:42.587 --> 07:45.548
- Okay.
- Good-bye.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.142
Merci.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.783
Honorine?

08:16.288 --> 08:18.205
Honorine.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.835
- Madame Charles Lampert?
- Yes.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.547
I'm Inspector Edouard Grandpierre
of the police judiciaire.

09:08.632 --> 09:11.175
Would you be so kind
as to come with me, please?

09:34.616 --> 09:36.075
Well, madame?

09:38.870 --> 09:40.079
You are positive?

09:42.624 --> 09:44.750
You loved him?

09:46.169 --> 09:48.087
I'm very cold.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.643
We discovered your husband's body...

10:02.727 --> 10:06.313
lying next to the tracks
of the Paris-Bordeaux railroad line.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.650
He was dressed only in his pajamas.

10:09.734 --> 10:14.363
Do you know of any reason
why he might have wanted to leave France?

10:14.447 --> 10:16.782
Leave? No.

10:16.866 --> 10:21.662
Your husband possessed
a ticket of passage on the Maranguape.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.915
It sailed for Venezuela
this morning at 7:00.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.917
I'm very confused.

10:27.002 --> 10:30.504
- He was American, your husband?
- Swiss.

10:30.588 --> 10:33.382
Ah, Swiss.
His profession?

10:33.466 --> 10:36.302
- He didn't have one.
- He was a wealthy man?

10:36.386 --> 10:38.304
I suppose so.
I don't know.

10:38.388 --> 10:41.640
- About how wealthy, would you say?
- I don't know.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.851
Where did he keep his money?

10:43.935 --> 10:45.853
I don't know.

10:45.937 --> 10:49.356
Besides yourself,
who is his nearest relative?

10:49.441 --> 10:54.194
- I don't know.
- That's absurd, madame. Totalement absurde.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.488
I know. I'm sorry.

10:56.573 --> 11:00.075
- It is all right?
- I wish you wouldn't.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.291
- Les effets de Lampert.
- D'accord.

11:08.668 --> 11:13.213
On Wednesday last, your husband sold the entire
contents of the apartment at public auction.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.215
Everything.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.510
The gallery paid him
1,250,000 new francs -

11:18.595 --> 11:21.388
in dollars,
a quarter of a million.

11:21.473 --> 11:24.808
The authorities in Bordeaux searched
his compartment on the train.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.810
They searched it thoroughly.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.772
They did not find $250,000.

11:33.860 --> 11:37.404
These few things are all that was found
in the train compartment.

11:37.489 --> 11:41.575
There was no other baggage.
Your husband must have been in a great hurry.

11:41.659 --> 11:45.913
One wallet containing 4,000 francs.

11:45.997 --> 11:49.875
One agenda. His last notation was
made yesterday, Thursday -

11:49.959 --> 11:52.753
5:00 p.m., Jardins des Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.755
- Why there?
- I don't know.

11:54.839 --> 11:59.426
- Perhaps he met somebody.
- Obviously.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.054
One ticket of passage to South America.

12:02.138 --> 12:06.934
One letter, stamped but unsealed,
addressed to you.

12:08.019 --> 12:10.312
May I see it, please?

12:13.483 --> 12:16.360
"My dear Regina,
I hope you are enjoying your holiday.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.612
"MegÃ¨ve can be so lovely
at this time of year.

12:18.696 --> 12:21.115
"The days pass very slowly,
and I hope to see you soon.

12:21.199 --> 12:23.117
"As always, Charles.

12:23.201 --> 12:27.579
P.S. Your dentist called yesterday.
Your appointment has been changed."

12:27.664 --> 12:29.581
Not much, is it?

12:29.666 --> 12:32.042
We took the liberty
of calling your dentist.

12:32.127 --> 12:34.044
We thought perhaps
we would learn something.

12:34.129 --> 12:36.463
- Did you?
- Yes.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.882
Your appointment has been changed.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.143
One key to your apartment.

12:49.227 --> 12:52.187
One comb.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.273
One fountain pen.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.650
One toothbrush.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.862
One tin of tooth powder.
That is all.

13:02.240 --> 13:06.201
If you will sign this list,
you may take the things with you.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.746
Is that all?
May I leave now?

13:09.831 --> 13:12.416
One more question.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.419
Is this your husband's passport?

13:16.504 --> 13:19.089
Yes.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.175
And this?

13:22.594 --> 13:25.137
I don't understand.

13:25.221 --> 13:34.104
And this?

14:05.762 --> 14:07.888
Oh, I telephoned but nobody answered.

14:07.972 --> 14:11.725
- Hello.
- Hello.

14:11.809 --> 14:16.146
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am
and see if there's anything I can do.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.232
How did you find out?

14:18.316 --> 14:20.651
It's in the afternoon papers.

14:20.735 --> 14:24.571
- I'm very sorry.
- Thank you.

14:24.656 --> 14:27.574
Uh-- Uh, I pressed the bell,
but it isn't ringing, I guess.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.535
I know.
There's no electricity.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.956
Well, where did everything go?

14:34.040 --> 14:37.167
Charles sold it all at auction.
This is all I have left.

14:39.170 --> 14:43.006
I love this room, but Charles never really
saw it - only the things in it.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.927
I think I prefer it this way.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.097
What are you going to do?

14:50.181 --> 14:53.684
Try and get my old job back
at EURESCO, I suppose.

14:53.768 --> 14:57.563
- Doing what?
- I'm a simultaneous translator, like Sylvie.

14:57.647 --> 15:00.274
Only she's English into French,
and I'm French into English.

15:00.358 --> 15:03.735
That's what I was doing
before I married Charles.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.196
The police probably think I killed him.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.532
Instant divorce, you mean?

15:08.616 --> 15:11.618
Something like that.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.538
It's terrible it ended this way, though -

15:14.622 --> 15:18.041
tossed off a train
like a sack of third-class mail.

15:18.126 --> 15:21.420
- Well, come on. You can't stay here.
- I don't know where to go.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.880
We'll find you a hotel.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.634
Nothing too expensive.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.803
I'm not a lady of leisure
anymore, you know.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.306
Something clean and modest
and near enough to EURESCO...

15:32.390 --> 15:34.474
so you can take a cab when it rains.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.768
- Okay?
- Okay.

15:54.203 --> 15:57.497
Not a very large turnout, is it?

15:57.582 --> 15:59.833
Didn't Charles have any friends?

15:59.917 --> 16:02.836
Don't ask me.
I'm only the widow.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.548
If Charles had died in bed,
we wouldn't even have him.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.471
At least he knows
how to behave at funerals.

16:19.937 --> 16:23.398
Have you no idea
who could have done it?

16:23.483 --> 16:27.736
Until two days ago the only thing
I really knew about Charles was his name.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.447
Now it seems I didn't even know that.

16:49.133 --> 16:53.220
- He must have known Charles pretty well.
- How can you tell?

16:53.304 --> 16:55.305
He's allergic to him.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.020
Bless you.

17:02.105 --> 17:05.232
- Do you know him?
- Never seen him before.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.856
Arrivederci, Charlie.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.698
Miz Lampert, ma'am -

17:55.783 --> 17:57.868
Uh, Miz Lampert, ma'am...

17:59.162 --> 18:01.705
Charlie had no call
of doin' it thataway.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.207
No sirree.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.246
What next?

18:47.919 --> 18:50.212
Mille pardons, madame.

18:50.296 --> 18:55.342
- Merci.
- Pardon. Pardon.

18:55.426 --> 18:58.804
Pardon. Pardon.

18:58.888 --> 19:02.015
- Who's it from?
- The American Embassy.

19:14.278 --> 19:17.823
I bluffed the old man out of the last pot
with a pair of deuces.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.825
What's so depressing about that?

19:19.909 --> 19:23.119
Well, if I can do it,
what are the Russians doing to him?

19:33.840 --> 19:38.051
Hello?

19:38.135 --> 19:40.929
Is there anything wrong, Miss Tompkins?

19:41.013 --> 19:43.723
Uh, Miss Tompkins isn't here.

19:45.810 --> 19:49.896
Oh, I'm sorry.
My secretary must have gone to lunch.

19:49.981 --> 19:53.567
- Uh, you are -
- Mrs. Lampert. Mrs. Charles Lampert.

19:53.651 --> 19:58.446
Oh, yes. Please, uh,
come in, Mrs. Lampert.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.993
Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Lampert.

20:03.077 --> 20:05.829
It's a stubborn little devil.

20:06.914 --> 20:10.208
Dry cleaning-wise,
things are all fouled up.

20:10.293 --> 20:15.630
I had a good man -
a really excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu...

20:15.715 --> 20:20.927
but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here
in the building to ease the gold outflow.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.680
Mr. Bartholomew,
are you quite sure you know who I am?

20:23.764 --> 20:25.849
You're Charles Lampert's widow, yes?

20:27.101 --> 20:29.060
I'm very sorry.

20:30.354 --> 20:33.148
Last time I sent out a tie,
only the spot came back.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.444
VoilÃ , as they say.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.654
Won't you sit down, Mrs. Lampert?

20:41.699 --> 20:43.992
I've got something here.

20:45.536 --> 20:48.788
I've got liverwurst, liverwurst,
chicken and liverwurst.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.957
No, thank you.

20:51.042 --> 20:54.753
Mrs. Lampert,
do you know what C.I.A. is?

20:54.837 --> 20:57.172
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?

20:58.716 --> 21:01.968
Central Intelligence Agency. C.I.A.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.054
You mean spies and all of that?

21:04.138 --> 21:07.474
- Only we call them agents.
- "We"? You mean you -

21:07.558 --> 21:09.559
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert.

21:09.644 --> 21:12.646
I didn't think people like you
were supposed to admit -

21:12.730 --> 21:18.318
Oh, I'm not an agent.
I'm an administrator, a desk jockey...

21:18.402 --> 21:22.864
trying to run a bureau
of overworked men with underallocated...

21:22.949 --> 21:24.824
funds.

21:24.909 --> 21:27.327
Congress seems to think
that all a spy needs -

21:27.411 --> 21:31.122
- Agent.
- Yes.

21:31.207 --> 21:36.294
That all he needs is a codebook,
a cyanide pill and he's in business.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.298
What's all this got to do
with me, Mr. Bartholomew?

21:40.383 --> 21:43.468
Your husband was wanted
by the United States government.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.473
May I have a sandwich, please?

21:48.557 --> 21:51.768
- Chicken or liverwurst?
- Chicken.

21:51.852 --> 21:57.107
To be more specific, Mrs. Lampert,
your husband was wanted by this agency.

21:57.191 --> 21:59.109
- So that was it.
- Yes.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.361
We, of course, knew him
by his real name -

22:01.445 --> 22:04.698
Voss. Charles Voss.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.994
All right, Mrs. Voss.

22:09.078 --> 22:13.790
I'd like you to look at this photograph
for a moment, please.

22:13.874 --> 22:16.626
Tell us if you recogni - Oh.

22:17.628 --> 22:19.546
By the way,
have you seen this one?

22:19.630 --> 22:22.924
Scott, Cathy and Ham, Jr.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.719
- Very sweet.
- Aren't they?

22:25.803 --> 22:28.638
- All right, Mrs. Voss -
- Please stop calling me that.

22:28.723 --> 22:32.726
- Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
- I'm terribly sorry.

22:32.810 --> 22:36.980
Mrs. Lampert, would you look at that photograph
and tell me if you recognize anyone?

22:37.064 --> 22:39.816
Just a moment.
Have a good look.

22:42.653 --> 22:45.321
- It's Charles.
- Very good.

22:45.406 --> 22:50.702
- He looks so young. When was this taken?
- 1944. Next, please.

22:50.786 --> 22:53.997
The man who was
at the funeral yesterday.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.249
A tall man in a corduroy suit.

22:56.333 --> 23:01.004
- Does the name Tex Penthollow
mean anything to you?
- No.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.006
- You like some wine?
- No, thank you.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.508
Next, please.

23:05.593 --> 23:09.387
He was there, too.
A little less hair, but it's the same one.

23:09.472 --> 23:12.515
Do you know him, Mrs. Lampert?
Leopold W. Gideon?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.851
- No.
- The last one, please.

23:14.935 --> 23:18.688
That's a face you don't forget.

23:18.773 --> 23:21.649
- He was there, too.
- Herman Scobie.

23:21.734 --> 23:25.361
- You've never seen him before either?
- No, thank heaven.

23:26.447 --> 23:30.950
Mrs. Lampert, I'm very much afraid
that you are in a great deal of danger.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.203
Why should I be in any danger?

23:33.287 --> 23:36.122
You're Charles Voss's wife.

23:36.207 --> 23:38.374
Now that he's dead,
you're their only lead.

23:38.459 --> 23:42.128
Mr. Bartholomew,
if you're trying to frighten me...

23:42.213 --> 23:44.464
you're doing a first-rate job.

23:44.548 --> 23:47.050
Please do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert.
It's your only chance.

23:47.134 --> 23:50.929
Gladly. But I don't know what you want.
You haven't told me.

23:51.013 --> 23:53.890
Oh? I haven't?

23:55.101 --> 23:58.478
Well, it's the money,
Mrs. Lampert, the money.

23:58.562 --> 24:02.649
The $250,000 Charles Voss
received from the auction.

24:02.733 --> 24:05.610
Those three men want it, too.
They want it very badly.

24:05.694 --> 24:08.321
But that's Charles's money, not theirs.

24:08.405 --> 24:11.699
Oh, Mrs. Lampert, I'd love to see you try
and convince them of that.

24:11.784 --> 24:15.453
- Oh, boy.
- But then whose is it? His or theirs?

24:16.455 --> 24:18.331
Ours.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.667
Oh.

24:20.751 --> 24:24.754
Charles Voss stole $250,000
from the United States government.

24:24.839 --> 24:28.675
- I'm afraid we want it back.
- But I don't have it.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.512
That's impossible, Mrs. Lampert.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.514
You're the only one who could have it.

24:34.598 --> 24:37.725
Mr. Bartholomew,
if I had a quarter of a million dollars...

24:37.810 --> 24:39.769
believe me, I'd know it.

24:39.854 --> 24:42.689
Nevertheless, Mrs. Lampert, you've got it.

24:42.773 --> 24:45.692
You mean it's just lying around somewhere,
all that cash?

24:45.776 --> 24:50.572
Or a certified check,
safe-deposit key, baggage claim.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.949
- Look for it. I'm quite sure you'll find it.
- But -

24:53.033 --> 24:57.537
Look for it.
Look just as hard and as fast as you can.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.956
You may not have a great deal of time.

25:00.040 --> 25:04.085
Those three men know you've got
the money just as surely as we do.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.462
You won't be safe until
the money's in our hands.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.673
Is that clear?

25:08.757 --> 25:12.719
Here's where you're
to call me, day or night.

25:12.803 --> 25:15.180
It's a direct line to both my office -

25:15.264 --> 25:17.182
and my apartment.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.642
And please don't tell anyone
about coming to see us today.

25:19.727 --> 25:22.020
It could prove fatal
for them as well as yourself.

25:22.104 --> 25:25.356
As I said, Mrs. Lampert,
I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.901
I regret very much
having to say this, but...

25:27.985 --> 25:31.237
please remember what happened
to your husband.

25:46.837 --> 25:49.547
- Hello.
- Hello, Peter.

25:49.632 --> 25:53.468
Didn't you telephone me
to meet you on that corner over there?

25:53.552 --> 25:55.720
I'm sorry.
I heard the children laughing.

25:57.181 --> 26:01.017
- Do you understand French?
- Not a word.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.603
I'm still having trouble with English.

26:03.687 --> 26:06.105
The man and the woman are married.

26:06.190 --> 26:09.234
Oh, I can see that.
They're batting each other over the head.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.277
Ay, ay, ay!

26:11.362 --> 26:15.240
Oh lÃ  lÃ  IÃ ! Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

26:15.324 --> 26:18.534
- Who's that with the hat?
- That's the policeman.

26:18.619 --> 26:21.120
He wants to arrest Judy
for killing Punch.

26:23.332 --> 26:26.918
- What's she saying now?
- That she's innocent.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.921
She didn't do it.

26:30.005 --> 26:33.466
- Oh, she did it, all right.
- I believe her.

26:35.636 --> 26:38.721
- Well, who was that?
- That's Punch, of course.

26:38.806 --> 26:41.349
"Punch, of course"?
I thought he was dead.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.477
He's only pretending,
to teach her a lesson.

26:45.896 --> 26:50.066
Only he is dead, Peter.
I saw him. He's not pretending.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.860
Somebody threw him off a train.

26:52.945 --> 26:57.282
Charles was mixed up in something terrible.
What am I going to do?

26:57.366 --> 26:59.409
I wish you'd let me help you.

26:59.493 --> 27:02.328
It doesn't sound like the sort of thing
a young woman can handle by herself.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.877
How about making me vice president
in charge of cheering you up?

27:11.714 --> 27:14.090
Starting tonight?

27:19.346 --> 27:22.473
Bonsoir, messieurs, dames.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.434
Buona sera, signore e signori.

27:24.518 --> 27:28.730
Ce soir, comme tous les autres soirs
d'ailleurs, vous savez trÃ¨s bien...

27:28.814 --> 27:32.692
qui ici au Black Sheep Club,
I'attraction, c'est vous!

27:32.776 --> 27:36.362
Alors, approchez-vous, messieurs, dames.

27:36.447 --> 27:38.614
Venez ici, step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.

27:38.699 --> 27:41.409
- What's going on?
- Fun and games.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.203
- Evidently we're the floor show. Come on.
- You and me?

27:44.288 --> 27:46.873
Everyone.

27:46.957 --> 27:48.875
Avanti, avanti,
signore e signori.

27:48.959 --> 27:51.336
Ecoutez-moi bien.
Les rÃ¨gles du jeu sont trÃ¨s simple.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.796
Ah, ecoutez-moi.
Alors, il y a deux Ã©quipes.

27:53.881 --> 27:57.550
There are two teams,
et pour chaque Ã©quipe, il y a une orange.

27:57.634 --> 28:01.471
For every team, there is one orange.
Una arancia.

28:01.555 --> 28:04.891
Eine Apfelsine. Vous mettez I'orange
sur le menton comme Ã§a -

28:04.975 --> 28:06.559
put the orange in like so.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.394
Vous passez cette orange
a la personne derriÃ¨re vous -

28:08.479 --> 28:10.396
You pass the orange
to the person behind you...

28:10.481 --> 28:12.607
mais sans servir les mains.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.651
Without the use of your hands.
Are you ready?

28:15.736 --> 28:19.072
Uno, due, tre -

29:20.217 --> 29:22.176
Whoop.

29:56.587 --> 29:58.671
- Mrs. Lampert.
- Who are you?

29:58.755 --> 30:01.674
- Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
- Tell me what?

30:01.758 --> 30:04.302
It doesn't belong to you.
You do know that, don't you?

30:04.386 --> 30:07.263
- I don't know anyth -
- Mrs. Lampert.

30:07.347 --> 30:10.933
Any morning now you could
wake up dead, Mrs. Lampert.

30:11.018 --> 30:13.019
- Leave me alone.
- Dead, Mrs. Lampert.

30:13.103 --> 30:15.354
Like last week's news.
Like Charles, Mrs. Lampert.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.523
Stop it!

30:19.526 --> 30:21.861
- What's the trouble?
- He stepped on my foot.

30:21.945 --> 30:24.155
- Forgive me.
- Wait here. I won't be long.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.491
It was quite unintentional, I'm sure.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.762
Mr. Bartholomew, this is Regina Lampert.

30:47.846 --> 30:53.059
Mr. Bartholomew, I just saw one of those m -
Mr. Bartholomew, can you hear me?

30:55.145 --> 30:57.980
Mr. Bartholomew,
this is Regina Lampert. I just -

31:03.904 --> 31:06.072
- Howdy.
- What do you want?

31:06.156 --> 31:09.784
- You must be kiddin'.
- No, I'm not.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.203
Come on now, Miz Lampert.

31:12.287 --> 31:15.540
You know what it is,
and you're gonna get it for me, too.

31:15.624 --> 31:18.751
'Cause you know
I ain't foolin' around here.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.216
No sirree, Bob.

31:26.843 --> 31:30.096
- Stop that, please!
- Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert.

31:30.180 --> 31:34.350
It could get a whole lot worse, you know.

31:36.520 --> 31:40.231
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert,
and you're gonna get it for me...

31:40.315 --> 31:44.360
or your life ain't gonna be worth
the paper it's printed on.

31:44.444 --> 31:47.905
- You "savez" what I'm sayin' to you?
- Stop! Stop! Please stop!

31:47.990 --> 31:51.951
- You go home and think it over
real careful like, you hear?
- You're absolutely insane!

32:01.878 --> 32:04.297
What's the matter?

32:04.381 --> 32:06.716
What are you doing in here?

32:07.884 --> 32:10.344
I'm having a nervous breakdown.

32:22.524 --> 32:25.901
Now hold it. I've waited long enough.
What happened back there?

32:25.986 --> 32:30.573
- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
- What does that mean?

32:30.657 --> 32:35.411
He said if I told anybody
it could prove fatal for them as well as for me.

32:35.495 --> 32:38.164
- Who said?
- That's what I'm not supposed to say.

32:38.248 --> 32:40.916
Eh -

32:41.001 --> 32:45.379
- Now stop that nonsense.
- Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.674
- I'm not bullying you.
- Yes, you were. You said it was nonsense.

32:48.759 --> 32:51.886
Being murdered in cold blood
is not nonsense.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.430
Why don't you try it sometime?

32:56.224 --> 32:59.685
- Would you mind seeing me to the door?
- Of course not.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.689
It's a good place for making friends.

33:06.777 --> 33:10.446
You said this afternoon your husband
was mixed up in something.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.531
How do you shave in there?

33:12.616 --> 33:14.533
What was it?

33:14.618 --> 33:17.787
- What was what?
- What your husband was mixed up in.

33:17.871 --> 33:20.623
Look, I know it's asking you
to stretch your imagination, but...

33:20.707 --> 33:23.709
don't you think you could pretend
just for a moment that I'm a woman?

33:23.794 --> 33:27.838
I could already be arrested for transporting
a minor above the first floor.

33:30.092 --> 33:32.551
- Here you are.
- Where?

33:32.636 --> 33:35.888
- On the street where you live.
- How about once more around the park?

33:35.972 --> 33:38.641
How about getting out of here?
Come on, child. Out.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.979
- Won't you come in for a minute?
- No, I won't.

33:45.315 --> 33:49.694
I don't bite, you know,
unless it's called for.

33:49.778 --> 33:53.739
- How would you like a spanking?
- How'd you like a punch in the nose?

33:53.824 --> 33:58.744
- Stop treating me like a child.
- Well then, stop behaving like one.

33:58.829 --> 34:00.871
If you want to tell me
what's troubling you, fine.

34:00.956 --> 34:03.499
If not, I'm tired,
it's late and I want to go home to bed.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.502
Oh -

34:06.586 --> 34:08.795
Do you know what's wrong with you?

34:08.880 --> 34:11.340
No. What?

34:11.425 --> 34:13.342
Nothing.

34:24.521 --> 34:26.772
Where is it, lady?

34:26.857 --> 34:28.774
I don't know.

34:37.033 --> 34:39.034
I want it.

34:39.119 --> 34:41.704
You give it to me.

34:41.788 --> 34:44.623
It's mine!

34:46.208 --> 34:48.878
Peter! Peter!

34:48.962 --> 34:51.672
- A man tried to kill me!
- What?

35:15.530 --> 35:20.576
Peter?

35:21.620 --> 35:23.829
Peter, are you all right?

35:23.914 --> 35:27.458
Oh, Peter. Are you hurt?

35:27.542 --> 35:29.835
Mm-hmm.
I sprained my pride.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.087
How are you?

35:32.172 --> 35:35.174
- Scared.
- You'll be all right.

35:35.258 --> 35:38.761
- Where did he go?
- Out the window, I guess.

35:38.845 --> 35:41.806
Lock the door,
and don't let anyone in except me.

35:41.890 --> 35:45.476
- And close these windows after me.
- Be careful.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.728
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.754
Alistair!

36:13.839 --> 36:17.466
- What is it now, Pamela?
- It happened again.

36:17.551 --> 36:22.012
Another strange man peered
in the window at me but then went away.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.181
Bad luck, Pamela.

36:44.494 --> 36:47.746
- That was a dumb move, Herman.
- Oh, man. And then some.

36:47.831 --> 36:50.207
If you'd let us known
you was goin' to her room...

36:50.292 --> 36:52.209
we could have done somethin'
to keep him busy.

36:52.294 --> 36:55.754
But sneakin' up thataway by yourself.

36:55.839 --> 36:58.215
What did you expect him to do?

36:58.300 --> 37:03.262
- Walk up and shake you by that hand of yours?
- A dumb move, Herman. A dumb move.

37:03.346 --> 37:06.932
Yes, it was a dumb move, Herman.
What is the matter with you?

37:07.017 --> 37:11.186
- You want some more?
- Never mind that. Did you get the money?

37:11.271 --> 37:15.524
How could I with the three Marx Brothers
breathing down my neck?

37:15.609 --> 37:18.193
I thought we had an agreement.

37:19.821 --> 37:21.739
Now, the girl trusts me.

37:21.823 --> 37:25.117
If she's got the money, I'll find out about it.
But you just leave me alone.

37:25.201 --> 37:30.289
We took all the chances.
The money belongs to us, not to him.

37:30.373 --> 37:33.626
Now, don't be piggy, Herman.

37:33.710 --> 37:37.463
A third of nothing is nothing.
Just think about that.

37:37.547 --> 37:40.925
But make up your mind.
She's waiting for me.

37:41.009 --> 37:44.053
I don't see how another 24 hours
could hurt anything.

37:44.137 --> 37:46.305
Shoot, no.
Not after all these years.

37:46.389 --> 37:50.184
Then he gets it out of your share.

37:50.268 --> 37:57.024
Not mine.

37:58.193 --> 38:00.736
Either one of you
got the room next to her?

38:00.820 --> 38:02.738
Yeah, I have. Why?

38:02.822 --> 38:05.616
Give me the key.
Get another room. I want to use it.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.701
Hmm.

38:12.999 --> 38:16.085
If you do find that money...

38:16.169 --> 38:19.171
you ain't gonna forget
to tell your buddies about it, are ya?

38:19.255 --> 38:23.550
- Don't worry.
- Oh, no, I ain't worryin'.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.053
You see this little fella here?

38:26.137 --> 38:28.806
Oh, he worries.

38:28.890 --> 38:31.100
And he's even meaner than I am.

38:53.623 --> 38:56.625
- Who is it?
- It's me, Peter.

39:14.310 --> 39:16.437
There was no trace of him.

39:17.981 --> 39:21.692
Why don't you confide in me
and tell me what this is all about?

39:23.486 --> 39:26.238
There are three men.
He's one of them.

39:26.322 --> 39:29.825
They think I have a quarter of a million
dollars that belongs to them.

39:32.662 --> 39:35.414
- Go on.
- That's all.

39:35.498 --> 39:39.084
- No, it isn't. Where's the money?
- I don't know.

39:39.169 --> 39:43.422
They killed Charles to get it,
but he must not have had it with him on the train.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.924
- So they think he left it with you.
- But he didn't.

39:46.009 --> 39:49.261
I've looked everywhere,
and if I don't find it they're going to kill me.

39:51.014 --> 39:53.265
No, they won't.
I won't let them.

39:54.559 --> 39:57.478
Peter, help me.
You're the only one I can trust.

39:58.521 --> 40:01.482
I'll help you.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.609
I told you I would. Come on.

40:03.693 --> 40:07.071
Oh, I'm so hungry I could faint.

40:07.155 --> 40:09.698
And I've gotten your suit all wet.

40:09.783 --> 40:13.786
That's all right. It's a drip-dry.

40:13.870 --> 40:16.288
Wipe your eyes.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.292
Promise me you'll never lie to me
the way Charles did.

40:20.376 --> 40:23.170
Why do people have to tell lies?

40:23.254 --> 40:27.925
Usually it's because they want something.
They're afraid the truth won't get it.

40:28.009 --> 40:31.220
Do you tell lies?

40:39.729 --> 40:42.314
- Hello?
- Mrs. Lampert, it's me...

40:42.398 --> 40:45.234
the man who was in your room
a few minutes ago.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.821
- What do you want?
- Who is it?

40:48.905 --> 40:51.115
It's the man you had the fight with.

40:51.199 --> 40:54.284
- Is Dyle with you?
- Who?

40:54.369 --> 40:58.831
The man I had the fight with, lady.
Dyle. That's his name.

40:58.915 --> 41:01.542
What's wrong?
Is he still there?

41:05.672 --> 41:10.676
- Yes, that's right.
- What's he saying?

41:10.760 --> 41:14.847
Don't trust him.
Don't tell him anything.

41:14.931 --> 41:17.141
He's after the money.

41:25.358 --> 41:27.276
What was all that about?

41:28.778 --> 41:30.696
He -

41:30.780 --> 41:34.825
- He said if I don't give him the money he'll kill me.
- Oh, don't take it seriously.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.912
He's just trying to frighten you.

41:38.997 --> 41:42.332
- I believe what he said.
- No, no. It's just a lot of words.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.751
Words can hurt.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.712
I know.

41:46.796 --> 41:49.756
Try to get some sleep.
You'll feel better.

41:49.841 --> 41:54.386
Don't worry. I've arranged
to take the room next door to you.

41:56.306 --> 41:58.640
So you'll be all right.

41:58.725 --> 42:01.059
If you want anything,
just bang on the wall.

42:01.144 --> 42:03.729
Better lock the door after me.

42:03.813 --> 42:06.565
Good night.

42:34.928 --> 42:38.263
But I am calm, Mr. Bartholomew.
What I'm trying to say is that -

42:38.348 --> 42:40.224
is that there's someone else.

42:40.350 --> 42:43.352
- What?
- Someone who wasn't in that photograph
you showed me today.

42:43.436 --> 42:46.855
He says his name is Peter Joshua,
but it isn't. It's Dyle.

42:48.650 --> 42:52.194
- Are you still there, Mr. Bartholomew?
- Yes, yes, Mrs. Lampert.

42:52.278 --> 42:55.155
Uh, I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is...

42:55.240 --> 42:58.283
but it's possible we were wrong
about who killed your husband.

42:58.368 --> 43:01.578
You mean... he might have?

43:02.747 --> 43:05.123
Mr. Bartholomew,
I'm catching the next plane out of here.

43:05.208 --> 43:08.293
I'm not going to sit around for somebody
to make chopped liver out of me.

43:08.378 --> 43:11.672
Now, take it easy, Mrs. Lampert.
Take it easy.

43:11.756 --> 43:14.675
Uh, where are you now?
Can you meet me at the market?

43:14.759 --> 43:17.761
- At Les Halles?
- Yes. Opposite Saint-Eustache.

43:17.845 --> 43:21.556
- I'll meet you there in 15 minutes.
- All right. I'll be there in 15 minutes.

44:08.771 --> 44:11.773
Allez vite, n'importe oÃ¹.
N'importe oÃ¹! Vite!

44:20.658 --> 44:22.617
Suivez ce taxi.

44:27.749 --> 44:32.169
- Were you followed?
- Yes, by Dyle. But I lost him.

44:32.253 --> 44:34.713
I'm beginning to think
women make the best spies.

44:34.797 --> 44:36.715
Agents.

44:36.799 --> 44:39.926
- He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew.
- No.

44:40.011 --> 44:43.221
- But I saw it.
- No, that's not Carson Dyle.

44:43.306 --> 44:46.892
- Carson?
- There's only one Dyle connected
with this affair, Mrs. Lampert.

44:46.976 --> 44:48.894
That's Carson Dyle.

44:48.978 --> 44:51.146
You mean you've known
about him all along?

44:52.148 --> 44:54.858
It's enough to make you
a vegetarian, isn't it?

44:55.818 --> 44:59.780
It's just lucky I'm not hanging
next to one of those things right now.

45:01.407 --> 45:03.742
Why didn't you tell me
you knew about Dyle?

45:03.826 --> 45:05.994
I didn't see any point.
Dyle's dead.

45:08.289 --> 45:10.499
Mr. Bartholomew,
what is all this about?

45:10.583 --> 45:15.545
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -

45:15.630 --> 45:17.923
the military espionage unit -

45:18.007 --> 45:20.175
were ordered behind the German lines...

45:20.259 --> 45:25.680
for the purpose of delivering
$250,000 in gold...

45:25.765 --> 45:28.225
to the French underground.

45:28.309 --> 45:30.685
The five men were, of course,
your husband Charles...

45:30.770 --> 45:33.438
the three men who showed up
at his funeral yesterday...

45:33.523 --> 45:35.816
and Carson Dyle.

45:35.900 --> 45:40.153
- Oh.
- But instead of delivering the gold, they stole it.

45:40.238 --> 45:42.697
- How?
- By burying it...

45:42.782 --> 45:45.575
then reporting
the Germans had captured it.

45:45.660 --> 45:47.953
All they had to do was
come back after the war...

45:48.037 --> 45:50.622
dig it up and split it five ways.

45:50.706 --> 45:55.085
Quarter of a million dollars
with no questions asked.

45:55.169 --> 45:57.462
May I have a cigarette, please?

45:58.548 --> 46:00.632
I can't stand those things.

46:00.716 --> 46:03.635
It's like drinking coffee through a veil.

46:03.719 --> 46:07.931
Everything went smoothly enough
until after the gold was buried.

46:08.015 --> 46:12.227
Before they could get out,
they were ambushed by a German patrol.

46:12.311 --> 46:15.730
A machine gun separated
Scobie from his right hand...

46:15.815 --> 46:18.817
and caught Carson Dyle
full in the stomach.

46:22.405 --> 46:24.656
What was wrong with that one?

46:24.740 --> 46:27.576
Nothing, I guess.
What happened then?

46:27.660 --> 46:31.705
- Have you any idea what these
things cost over here?
- Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.748
What happened then?

46:35.918 --> 46:41.339
Carson Dyle was dead,
but Scobie was able to travel. So -

46:41.424 --> 46:44.384
- La soupe, c'est pour qui?
- Pour moi.

46:53.936 --> 46:55.854
Where was I?

46:55.938 --> 46:58.356
- Carson Dyle was dead.
- Yes. Carson Dyle was dead.

46:58.441 --> 47:01.568
The others finally got back to the base
and waited for the war to end...

47:01.652 --> 47:04.488
only Charles couldn't wait
quite as long as the others.

47:04.572 --> 47:08.325
He beat them back to the gold,
took everything for himself and disappeared.

47:08.409 --> 47:12.204
It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time
to catch up with him again.

47:12.288 --> 47:16.208
But if they stole all that money,
why can't you arrest them?

47:16.292 --> 47:18.668
Shh.

47:18.753 --> 47:22.797
We know what happened from the bits and pieces
we were able to paste together...

47:22.882 --> 47:25.091
but we still have no proof.

47:25.176 --> 47:27.802
What's this got to do with the C.I.O.?

47:31.766 --> 47:34.768
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert.

47:34.852 --> 47:38.230
It's an extension of the wartime O.S.S.

47:38.314 --> 47:40.357
It's our money, and we want it back.

47:40.441 --> 47:44.236
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew,
but nothing you've said has changed my mind.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.446
I'm leaving Paris tonight.

47:47.532 --> 47:50.158
Wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert.

47:50.243 --> 47:53.578
Better consider what happened
to your husband when he tried to leave.

47:53.663 --> 47:56.331
Those men won't be very far away
no matter where you go.

47:56.415 --> 47:59.292
In fact, I don't even see any point
in your changing hotels.

47:59.377 --> 48:02.087
Now, please help us, Mrs. Lampert.

48:02.171 --> 48:04.756
Your government is counting on you.

48:07.093 --> 48:10.262
Well, if I'm going to die,
I might as well do it for my country.

48:10.346 --> 48:13.598
That's the spirit.
Here's what I want you to do.

48:13.683 --> 48:17.269
We're anxious to know who this man is -
the one calling himself Dyle.

48:17.353 --> 48:19.229
I want you to find out.

48:19.313 --> 48:21.606
Why me?

48:21.691 --> 48:24.359
You're in an ideal position.
He trusts you.

48:24.443 --> 48:29.906
Besides, you yourself said
women make the best spies.

48:29.991 --> 48:32.617
Agents.

48:44.380 --> 48:46.381
Oh, pardon.

49:09.655 --> 49:13.158
- FrÃ¤ulein. FrÃ¤ulein.
- What are you doing following me?

49:13.242 --> 49:17.245
It's gonna look like a parade. Stop it.

49:23.586 --> 49:25.920
How are you? Nice to see you.
When did you arrive?

49:26.005 --> 49:29.174
It's a lovely town. Are you having a good time?
So many things to see.

49:35.264 --> 49:36.973
FrÃ¤ulein.

49:37.058 --> 49:38.975
FrÃ¤ulein!

49:39.060 --> 49:41.770
If you don't stop following me,
I'll call the police.

49:43.898 --> 49:45.690
Taxi!

50:08.839 --> 50:10.924
Dyle, pIease. D-Y-L-E.

50:11.008 --> 50:13.009
Yes, Mr. Dyle. I remember.

50:17.890 --> 50:21.893
- No, I'm sorry, Mr. Dyle. Nothing today.
- Thank you.

50:21.977 --> 50:25.230
Mr. Dyle, pIease.
You're wanted on the telephone.

50:25.314 --> 50:27.357
Mr. Dyle. Cabin four.

50:27.441 --> 50:29.776
Mr. Dyle. Cabin four, pIease.

50:37.326 --> 50:41.246
- Yes?
- Good morning, Mr. Dyle.

50:42.832 --> 50:45.750
- Reggie?
- It's the only name I've got. How about you?

50:45.835 --> 50:48.336
No cat and mouse. You've got me.
What do you want to know?

50:48.421 --> 50:50.588
Why you lied to me.

50:50.673 --> 50:53.675
I had to. For all I knew,
you were in on the whole thing.

50:53.759 --> 50:57.429
- I'm trying to find out who you are.
- You know my name. It's Dyle.

50:57.513 --> 50:59.431
Carson Dyle is dead.

50:59.515 --> 51:01.891
Yes, he is.
He was my brother.

51:03.394 --> 51:05.270
Your brother?

51:05.354 --> 51:08.440
The army thinks he was
killed in action by the Germans...

51:08.524 --> 51:12.610
but I think they did it -
Tex, Gideon, Scobie and your husband -

51:12.695 --> 51:16.114
because my brother wouldn't
go along with their scheme to steal the gold.

51:16.198 --> 51:18.450
I think he threatened
to turn them in and they killed him.

51:18.534 --> 51:23.580
I'm trying to prove it. They think
I'm working with them, but I'm not, Reggie.

51:23.664 --> 51:25.790
I'm on your side.
Just believe that.

51:25.875 --> 51:28.835
How can I? You lied to me
just the way Charles did.

51:28.919 --> 51:30.837
After promising you wouldn't.

51:30.921 --> 51:33.465
Oh, I want to believe you, Peter -

51:33.549 --> 51:35.467
I can't call you that anymore, can I?

51:35.551 --> 51:39.512
Take me a while to get used to
your new name. What is it?

51:40.556 --> 51:42.557
Hmm? Hello?

51:44.059 --> 51:46.060
Hello?

51:58.949 --> 52:01.993
Do anything funny or try to
talk to anyone and I'll kill you, Dyle.

52:02.077 --> 52:04.287
You'll wreck your raincoat.

52:05.372 --> 52:07.290
Take the next car, please.

52:25.142 --> 52:28.228
Look out.
Didn't want you to bump your head.

52:30.105 --> 52:32.774
All right, get in there.

52:42.451 --> 52:44.452
All right, turn around.

52:53.295 --> 52:55.797
Now sit down.

53:06.642 --> 53:10.603
- Now what?
- We wait. With our mouth shut.

53:19.446 --> 53:21.489
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

53:32.501 --> 53:35.461
Okay. Up there.

53:44.179 --> 53:47.432
- Do I knock or something?
- No, open it...

53:47.516 --> 53:49.976
and keep right on goin'.

53:50.060 --> 53:52.604
The view had better be worth it.

54:06.744 --> 54:08.745
Very pretty. Now what?

54:11.707 --> 54:13.875
I was afraid of that.

54:18.255 --> 54:22.717
I'll give you a chance, Dyle,
which is more than you'd give me.

54:23.761 --> 54:25.762
Where's the money?

54:27.056 --> 54:31.100
Is that why you dragged me all the way
up here? To ask me that?

54:31.185 --> 54:35.313
- She has it.
- And I say maybe you both have it.

54:35.397 --> 54:39.859
One more time, Dyle.
Where is it?

54:39.944 --> 54:44.322
Supposing I had it -
which I don't -

54:44.406 --> 54:47.742
do you really think
I'd just hand it over to you?

54:50.704 --> 54:52.622
Step back.

54:55.584 --> 54:57.502
Back where?

54:57.586 --> 55:00.296
That's the idea.

55:00.381 --> 55:05.259
Hmm. Now - Now, just a minute.
Take it easy.

56:50.407 --> 56:54.494
- Herman?
- What?

56:56.872 --> 57:00.291
- How you doing?
- How do you think?

57:00.375 --> 57:05.338
If you get bored, try writing "Love thy neighbor"
100 times on the side of the building.

57:16.141 --> 57:21.145
Monsieur, next time, please,
use the keyhole, hmm?

57:33.325 --> 57:35.243
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

57:36.578 --> 57:40.039
- You gonna open up?
- Sure. Wait a minute.

57:40.124 --> 57:44.377
Don't you know it's impolite
to leave someone holding... the phone?

57:44.461 --> 57:46.379
What happened?

57:46.463 --> 57:48.881
Oh, I met a man with sharp nails.

57:50.968 --> 57:53.052
- Scobie?
- Mm-hmm.

57:53.137 --> 57:56.848
I left him hanging around
the American Express.

57:56.932 --> 57:59.851
Come in. I've got something
that stings like crazy.

57:59.935 --> 58:02.854
You're the kind of girl
that'd have something like that.

58:02.938 --> 58:04.856
Sit down.

58:04.940 --> 58:06.858
Uh, w-w-wait a minute.

58:06.942 --> 58:08.860
- W-W-What is that stuff?
- Marvelous stuff.

58:08.944 --> 58:11.863
- Gonna hurt you much more
than it's gonna hurt me.
- I'll bet -

58:11.947 --> 58:14.365
Oh! Did you hear something rip?

58:14.449 --> 58:16.993
- No.
- Oh. That's odd.

58:19.079 --> 58:21.998
Listen, I-I only came in for an estimate.

58:22.082 --> 58:24.500
Sit still. It's not too bad.

58:24.585 --> 58:27.420
You won't be able to
lie on your back for a few days.

58:27.504 --> 58:30.423
- But then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
- Oh-ho-ho -

58:30.507 --> 58:32.425
- Ooh!
- Does it hurt?

58:32.509 --> 58:34.427
- What?
- Does it hurt?

58:34.511 --> 58:36.429
Oh. Are you kidding?

58:36.513 --> 58:39.390
Have you got a bullet I could bite,
like they do in the movies?

58:39.474 --> 58:42.351
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?

58:42.436 --> 58:44.812
Would you like to see my passport?

58:44.897 --> 58:47.440
Passport?
What kind of a proof is that?

58:47.524 --> 58:50.693
- Well, would you like to see where I was tattooed?
- Yes.

58:50.777 --> 58:53.196
All right.
We'll drive around that way.

58:55.282 --> 58:59.202
You could at least tell me
what your first name is these days.

58:59.286 --> 59:02.038
Alexander.

59:02.122 --> 59:04.040
Okay, Alexander.

59:04.124 --> 59:06.042
- You're done.
- Good.

59:06.126 --> 59:08.544
You're a new man.

59:08.629 --> 59:11.547
I'm sorry the old one
couldn't tell you the truth...

59:11.632 --> 59:15.092
but I had to find out
your part in all this.

59:15.177 --> 59:17.094
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?

59:17.179 --> 59:19.096
Yes.

59:19.181 --> 59:21.557
But we're divorced.

59:21.642 --> 59:23.768
I thought that was Peter Joshua.

59:23.852 --> 59:26.729
I'm just as difficult
to Iive with as he was.

59:28.023 --> 59:30.983
Alex, how can you tell
if anyone's lying or not?

59:32.110 --> 59:34.528
- You can't.
- There must be some way.

59:34.613 --> 59:37.531
There's an old riddle about
two tribes of Indians.

59:37.616 --> 59:40.660
The Whitefeet always tell the truth,
and the Blackfeet always lie.

59:40.744 --> 59:42.662
One day you meet an Indian.
You say...

59:42.746 --> 59:46.666
"Hey, Indian, what are you,
a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot?"

59:46.750 --> 59:49.835
He says, "I'm a truthful Whitefoot."
But which is he?

59:52.297 --> 59:54.715
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?

59:54.800 --> 59:56.592
Because he's wearing moccasins.

59:56.677 --> 59:59.095
Well, then, he's a truthful Whitefoot,
of course.

59:59.179 --> 01:00:00.846
Why not a lying Blackfoot?

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:06.018
- Which one are you?
- A truthful Whitefoot.

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:09.814
Come in.

01:00:09.898 --> 01:00:12.316
- Sit down.
- Why? Do you wanna look at my feet?

01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:14.610
Yes.

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:19.615
Uh-oh. Ohh. Hey, knock it off.
Come on, Reggie. Listen to me.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.617
Here it comes, the fatherly talk.

01:00:21.702 --> 01:00:24.829
- You forget I'm already a widow.
- So was Juliet, at 15.

01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:28.165
- But I'm not 15.
- Well, that's your trouble. You're too old for me.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:31.502
- Can't you be serious?
- Oh! You just said an horrible word.

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:34.005
- What did I say?
- Serious.

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:37.550
When I man gets to be my age,
that's the last word he ever wants to hear.

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:41.595
I don't want to be serious,
and I especially don't want you to be.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:46.100
Okay, we'll just sit around all day long
being frivolous. How about that, hmm?

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:48.644
Reggie, cut it out.

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:51.647
Okay.

01:00:51.732 --> 01:00:54.191
- Now what are you doing?
- Cutting it out.

01:00:54.276 --> 01:00:56.610
- Who told you to do that?
- You did.

01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:58.779
I'm not through complaining yet.

01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:00.781
Oh.

01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:06.954
- Now cut it out.
- Alex, I think I love you.

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.544
Hey, the telephone's ringing.

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:15.546
Never mind.

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:18.549
Whoever it is won't give up,
and neither will I.

01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:20.551
Just a minute.
Go on, take it.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:25.097
Hello.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:28.351
I'm sorry, uh -
I was just, uh -

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:30.353
nibbling on something.

01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:32.355
Say, I'd appreciate it mighty highly...

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:36.359
if you'd, uh, wiggle on over to Room 46
and chew the fat for a spell.

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:38.694
Could you give me
one good reason why I should?

01:01:38.779 --> 01:01:43.366
Yeah. A little one, about six or seven.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.659
Keeps callin' for Aunt Reggie.

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:48.371
Ain't that cute?

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:50.831
They've got Jean-Louis.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:54.668
I'll be right there.

01:01:57.089 --> 01:02:01.008
Hey, Tex, do somethin' with this kid, will ya?
My leg's goin' to sleep.

01:02:01.093 --> 01:02:03.677
Upsy-daisy.

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:05.679
Are you a real cowboy?

01:02:05.764 --> 01:02:07.681
Yeah, sure I am, kid.

01:02:07.766 --> 01:02:09.683
So where's your gun?

01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:15.773
Will you put that thing away!

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:17.775
Jean-Louis.

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:19.860
Howdy, Miz Lampert.

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.863
Who invited him?

01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:25.282
Well, Herman, I see
you had a happy landing.

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:27.284
I must call Sylvie right away.

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:30.287
- I'm afraid that'll have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
- It's his mother.

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:33.541
She won't be anybody's mother
unless you answer some questions.

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:36.710
- This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
- We want that money now.

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:40.131
Why don't you keep quiet and
stop threatening the child.

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:43.843
He hasn't got the money,
and neither has Mrs. Lampert.

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:45.219
Then who does?

01:02:45.303 --> 01:02:48.305
I don't know, Herman.
Maybe you do.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:50.099
Me?

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:53.018
- Or you.
- Ohh.

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:56.313
- Or him.
- Why, that's the most ridiculous thing I ever -

01:02:56.398 --> 01:02:59.316
- Listen to this man.
- Man's gone loco.

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:04.113
Now hoId it. Suppose one of you
found Charles here in Paris.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:06.115
Even bumped into him by accident...

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:09.743
followed him when he tried to run out again,
cornered him on the train...

01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:12.705
threw him out the window and,
without bothering to tell the other two...

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:14.748
took all the money for yourself.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:18.294
If one of us did that, he wouldn't hang around
waiting for the other two to figure it out.

01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:22.256
But he'd have to. Don't you see?
If he left, he'd be admitting his guilt.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:25.301
Whoever it is has to wait here
pretending to look for the money...

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:28.512
waiting for the rest of us
to give up and go home.

01:03:28.597 --> 01:03:31.849
He's just tryin' to throw us off.
They got it, I tell ya.

01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:34.351
Why don't we search their rooms?

01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:37.354
That's all right with us.

01:03:37.439 --> 01:03:40.858
Then what are we wastin' time for?
Let's go.

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:43.777
- While we're waiting, we'll search yours.
- Not my room.

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:47.823
Well, Herman.
You have something to hide?

01:03:49.534 --> 01:03:52.203
Then there are no objections.

01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:54.205
All right, here's my key.

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:56.957
- I'll take that.
- My room's open.

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:58.959
Everyone. Whoa.
Come on.

01:04:01.213 --> 01:04:04.131
Now, you two
just make yourselves to home here.

01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:07.885
Well, let's get busy.

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:11.388
Come on, Jean-Louis.
Come along. Oh, that's fine.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:14.391
- Who gets your vote?
- Scobie. He's the one who objected.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:17.394
All right,
I'll take Tex's room here and Gideon's.

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:20.564
You take Jean-Louis with you,
and bolt the door from inside.

01:04:20.649 --> 01:04:23.317
Come on, Jean-Louis.
We'll have a treasure hunt.

01:04:25.946 --> 01:04:27.863
Tex?

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:32.409
Man, that's Charlie's stuff.

01:04:32.494 --> 01:04:34.411
Looks like it.

01:04:34.496 --> 01:04:36.914
- Think we ought to call Herman?
- What for?

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:39.917
If it's not here,
why bother him?

01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:42.044
And if it is?

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:44.171
Why bother him?

01:04:47.968 --> 01:04:50.094
Oh.

01:04:50.178 --> 01:04:53.097
- What?
- Sure there's nothing missing here?

01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:57.309
No, everything's here.
The police have kindly provided us with a list.

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:01.772
Sure ain't nothin' here
worth no quarter of a million dollars.

01:05:01.856 --> 01:05:03.774
Not unless we're blind.

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:07.111
I keep telling myself
we've stolen a great deal of money...

01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:10.114
but up to now I've yet
to see a penny of it.

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:13.200
You think maybe we're fishin'
up the wrong stream?

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:16.453
Meaning what?

01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:20.332
Suppose one of us has it.
You know, like the man says.

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:22.626
Now, that'd be mighty distasteful...

01:05:22.711 --> 01:05:25.629
us bein' veterans
of the same war and all.

01:05:25.714 --> 01:05:30.467
Well, you know I'd tell you if I had it.

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:33.679
Oh, naturally.
Just like I'd tell you if I had it.

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.681
Naturally.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:38.017
And that goes for Herman, too.

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:40.227
Naturally.

01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:46.567
He's all right, Sylvie. Honestly.

01:05:46.651 --> 01:05:49.737
Just hurry over as soon as you can.
Okay. Good-bye.

01:05:51.573 --> 01:05:55.159
Now, if you had a treasure,
where would you hide it?

01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:58.329
I would bury it in the garden.

01:05:58.413 --> 01:06:01.332
Swell, but this man
doesn't have a garden.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:03.834
- Oh, neither do I.
- You don't?

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:08.005
Well, if you had to hide it in this room,
where would you put it?

01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:10.841
- Up there.
- On top of that cupboard?

01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:14.428
You know something?
You may be right.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:22.144
Oh, I hope I don't find
any hairy little things living up here.

01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:25.898
Hey, there is something.
And it's heavy.

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.359
I found it!
I found it! I found it!

01:06:28.443 --> 01:06:31.695
If you think you're getting credit for this,
you're crazy.

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:33.864
We won!
We won! We won!

01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:37.076
We won! We won!
We won! We won!

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:40.537
We found it!
We found it!

01:06:40.622 --> 01:06:42.539
- Did you find it?
- No.

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:45.542
- What do you mean, no?
- The kid was yellin'.

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:48.003
Up there.
It's up there.

01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:50.798
Believe me,
there's nothing up there.

01:06:50.882 --> 01:06:52.800
Yeah?

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:57.179
Oh!

01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:12.152
Oh! Jumpin' frijoles.

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:13.987
It's Herman's spare.

01:07:16.324 --> 01:07:20.119
- Where is he?
- He's over in my room.

01:07:37.762 --> 01:07:40.681
You'd better take the boy
out in the hall.

01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:52.735
Oh, now, who would've done
a mean thing like that?

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.238
I'm not quite sure.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:58.449
Well, this ain't my room.

01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:00.492
Mine neither.

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:03.787
Oh, the police aren't going to like this a bit.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:08:03.872 --> 01:08:07.875
We could dry him off and take him
down the hall to his own room.

01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:10.335
He really doesn't look too bad.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.463
Oh, poor old Herman.

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:16.716
Seems like him and good luck
always was strangers.

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:20.720
Well, maybe now he'll meet up with
his other hand someplace.

01:08:29.147 --> 01:08:31.564
A man drowned in his bed?

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:33.567
Impossible.

01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:36.194
And in his pajamas -
the second one in his pajamas.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.238
C'est trop stupide.

01:08:38.323 --> 01:08:40.198
Stop lying to me.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:43.243
This nose tells me when you are lying.

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:46.537
It is never mistaken,
not in 23 years.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:49.666
This nose will make me
commissaire of police.

01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:53.796
Mr. Dyle, or Mr. Joshua -
Which is it?

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.798
Dyle.

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:59.091
And yet you registered
in MegÃ¨ve as Mr. Joshua.

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:03.095
Didn't you know it was against the law
to register under an assumed name?

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:07.142
- No, I didn't.
- It's done in America all the time.

01:09:08.228 --> 01:09:10.479
None of you will be
permitted to leave Paris...

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:12.648
until this matter is cleared up.

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:16.234
Only I warn you,
I will be watching.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:20.363
We use the guillotine in this country.

01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:23.908
I have always suspected
that the blade coming down...

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:27.453
causes no more than
a slight tickling sensation...

01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:29.957
on the back of the neck.

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:31.959
It is only a guess, of course.

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:35.295
I hope none of you ever
finds out for certain.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.179
Who do you think did it?

01:09:44.264 --> 01:09:47.390
- Gideon?
- Possibly.

01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:50.060
- Or Tex?
- Possibly.

01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:52.062
- You're a fat lot of help.
- That's right.

01:09:52.145 --> 01:09:54.064
- Can I have one of those?
- One of what?

01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:56.066
- I think Tex did it.
- Oh.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:59.069
- Vanille et chocolat, s'il vous plait.
- Why do you think Tex did it?

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:01.071
Because I really suspect Gideon...

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:03.615
and it's always the person
you don't suspect.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:07.160
Do women think it feminine to be so illogical,
or can't they help it?

01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:09.162
What's so illogical about that?

01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:12.165
You just said it's always
the one you don't suspect.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:14.585
You suspect Gideon,
therefore it must be Tex.

01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:18.797
On the other hand, if you suspect Tex
it must be the other fella, Gideon.

01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:21.008
- I guess they just can't help it.
- Hmm?

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:23.010
- Who?
- Women.

01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:25.012
Oh.

01:10:25.096 --> 01:10:27.848
You know, I can't help
feeling rather sorry for Scobie.

01:10:29.017 --> 01:10:31.351
Wouldn't it be nice
if we were like that?

01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:33.353
- What, like Scobie?
- No. Gene Kelly.

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:36.356
Remember when he danced down here
by the river in An American in Paris...

01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:38.358
without a care in the world?

01:10:38.443 --> 01:10:41.278
- Hmm.
- You know, this is good. Want some?

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:44.239
- Uh -
- Oh!

01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:46.241
No, thanks.

01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:49.953
I guess you don't either. Here, give me that.

01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:52.080
I'm sorry.

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:55.042
Alex, I'm scared.

01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:57.169
Yes, I know.

01:10:57.253 --> 01:11:00.088
I can't think of any reason
why he was killed.

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:03.383
Well, perhaps someone thought
that four shares were too many.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:07.137
What makes you think that this someone
is going to be satisfied with three?

01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:11.975
- He wants it all. That means we're in his way, too.
- That's right.

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:16.271
We've got to do something. I mean,
any minute now we could be assassinated.

01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:18.273
Would you do anything like that?

01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:21.026
What, assassinate someone?

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:23.820
No. Swing down from there
on a rope to save the woman you love.

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:25.864
Like the hunchback of Notre Dame.

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:27.824
Uh - Huh?

01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:30.869
Who put that there?

01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:38.126
- Hurry up and change. I'm starved.
- Let me know what you want to eat...

01:11:38.211 --> 01:11:40.170
so I can pick out a suit that matches.

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:42.255
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:52.391
Uh-uh.

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:53.850
What do you want?

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:57.104
It's the house detective.
Why don't you have a girl in there?

01:11:57.188 --> 01:11:59.106
God, you're a pest.

01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:02.567
- Can I come in?
- No. I'm going to take a bath.

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:05.529
Wouldn't it be better
if you did it in here?

01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:09.032
- What for?
- Well, I wouldn't want to use that tub.

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:12.119
Anyway, I don't want to be alone.
I'm afraid.

01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:14.454
You're only next door.
If anything happens, holler.

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:22.921
Reggie?

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:24.840
Got you. Ha, ha.

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:28.760
Did you ever hear the story
of the boy who cried wolf?

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:31.096
The shower's in there.

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:34.725
- Oh, come on, open the door.
- This is a ludicrous situation.

01:12:34.809 --> 01:12:38.228
I can think of a dozen men
who are just longing to use my shower.

01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:41.690
- Why don't you call one of them?
- I dare you.

01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:44.192
Oh, you're a nut.

01:12:46.404 --> 01:12:49.740
- What are you doing?
- Taking off my shoes.

01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:53.243
Did you ever hear of anyone
taking a shower with their shoes on?

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:59.249
I usually sing a medley of old favorites
when I'm in the shower.

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:02.169
- Any requests?
- Shut the door.

01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:06.381
I'm afraid I don't know that one, miss.
Well -

01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:08.508
- Shut the door.
- Why?

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:10.510
Come in and watch.

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:24.524
Drip-dry.

01:13:25.777 --> 01:13:28.445
How often do you go through
this little ritual?

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:31.239
Oh, every day.
The manufacturer recommends it.

01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:33.158
I don't believe it.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:35.535
Oh, yes, it's -
Wait a minute.

01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:39.081
Here's the label.

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:41.083
Look at the small print.

01:13:42.293 --> 01:13:44.377
"Wearing this suit during washing...

01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:46.838
helps protect its shape."

01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:52.469
Whoo!

01:13:53.513 --> 01:13:56.431
Waterproof.

01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:02.896
Wait.

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.690
Acro-nylon.
Fibrous resistant.

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:09.694
Plastic. Rustproof. Fireproof. Proof-proof.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.696
- You're the nut.
- Nut-proof.

01:14:17.245 --> 01:14:20.455
- Yes?
- Mrs. Lampert? Bartholomew.

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:22.624
I spoke to Washington, Mrs. Lampert.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:25.210
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew.
I'm listening.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:29.965
Well, I told them what you said
about this man being Carson Dyle's brother.

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:33.218
I asked them what they knew about it,
and they told me.

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:35.470
You're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert.

01:14:35.555 --> 01:14:38.140
Carson Dyle had no brother.

01:14:40.059 --> 01:14:42.978
- Mrs. Lampert?
- Are you sure there's no mistake?

01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:46.398
None whatsoever.
Please be careful, Mrs. Lampert.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.400
Bye.

01:14:57.285 --> 01:15:00.328
I left all my drip-dry dripping.
Is that all right?

01:15:00.413 --> 01:15:02.455
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

01:15:03.624 --> 01:15:05.542
You're probably weak from hunger.

01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:07.544
You've only eaten five times today.

01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:11.423
I'll get someone to fix up my suit quickly
and take you out to dinner.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:14.134
Let's go somewhere crowded.
I feel like a lot of people.

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:26.980
Hey, you know, this thing is still damp.

01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:34.154
You haven't spoken a word for 20 minutes.

01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:37.449
I was thinking about Charles and Scobie
and who's going to be next.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.451
Me?

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:42.454
I don't suppose you know
who the murderer is, do you?

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:44.456
No. Not yet.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.960
Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty much
have sewn up the nomination, don't you think?

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:52.422
What are you trying to say,
that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:55.383
What do I have to do to satisfy you?
Become the next victim?

01:15:55.468 --> 01:15:58.386
- It's a start, anyway.
- Oh.

01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:00.388
I can't understand you at all.

01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:02.599
One minute you're chasing me
around the shower room.

01:16:02.683 --> 01:16:04.684
The next minute you're
accusing me of murder.

01:16:05.937 --> 01:16:08.063
Carson Dyle had no brother.

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:15.153
Oh, I can explain that,
if you'll just listen.

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:18.657
Well, I can't very well leave
without a pair of water wings, can I?

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:22.285
- All right, get set for the story of my life.
- Fiction or nonfiction?

01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:25.664
- Eh - Why don't you shut up?
- Well!

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:28.458
- Are you going to listen?
- Go on.

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:30.460
All right.

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:34.965
Now, when I was a young man,
my father expected me to go into his business.

01:16:35.049 --> 01:16:37.968
Umbrella frames.
That's what he made.

01:16:38.052 --> 01:16:42.138
A sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't
have the sense in those days to be sensible.

01:16:42.223 --> 01:16:44.724
I suppose all this is leading somewhere.

01:16:44.809 --> 01:16:47.978
Well, it led me away from umbrella frames,
for one thing.

01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:50.981
But that left me without
any honest means of support.

01:16:51.065 --> 01:16:52.983
What do you mean?

01:16:53.067 --> 01:16:54.985
Well, in this highly competitive world...

01:16:55.069 --> 01:16:58.321
when a man has no profession,
there isn't much choice...

01:16:58.406 --> 01:17:01.992
so I began looking for people
who had more money than they needed...

01:17:02.076 --> 01:17:04.202
including some they'd barely miss.

01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:06.371
You mean you're a thief?

01:17:07.498 --> 01:17:09.833
Well, that's not exactly
the term I'd have chosen...

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:13.628
but it sort of captures
the spirit of the thing.

01:17:13.713 --> 01:17:16.923
I don't believe it.

01:17:17.008 --> 01:17:19.551
I can't really blame you now.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:22.512
But I do believe it.
That's what I don't believe.

01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:25.932
So it's good-bye, Alexander Dyle,
welcome home, Peter Joshua.

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:29.185
Sorry. The name's Adam Canfield.

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:32.856
- Adam Canfield?
- Mm-hmm.

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:36.901
Wonderful. Do you realize you've had
three names in the past two days?

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:39.654
I don't even know
who I'm talking to anymore.

01:17:39.739 --> 01:17:42.949
- Well, the man's the same, even if the name isn't.
- No, he isn't.

01:17:43.034 --> 01:17:46.286
- Adam Canfield is a crook, and I want to know why.
- Well, it's simple.

01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:48.788
I like what I do. I enjoy my work.

01:17:48.873 --> 01:17:51.541
There aren't many men
who love their work as much as I do.

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:54.044
You look around sometime.

01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:56.629
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:00.383
- Yes, but we're divorced.
- "But we're divorced."

01:18:00.468 --> 01:18:03.887
- That's right. Now go and eat your dinner.
- Oh, I could eat a horse.

01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:05.889
I think that's what you ordered.

01:18:05.973 --> 01:18:09.392
Don't you dare be civil with me
after leading me on like this.

01:18:09.477 --> 01:18:12.896
- How did I lead you on?
- Oh, all that marvelous rejection.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.898
You knew I couldn't resist it.

01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:18.151
- Now it turns out all you're
interested in is the money.
- That's right.

01:18:18.235 --> 01:18:21.154
- Oh.
- Well, what would you like me to say?

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:24.574
That a pretty girl with an outrageous manner
means more to an old pro like me...

01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:26.576
than a quarter of a million dollars?

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:30.205
- I don't suppose so.
- It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.

01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:32.457
Hmm.

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.918
- What?
- Hasn't it occurred to you...

01:18:35.002 --> 01:18:38.046
that I'm having a tough time
keeping my hands off you?

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:46.054
- Oh, you should see your face.
- What's the matter with it?

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:47.806
It's lovely.

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:49.808
Ohh.

01:18:50.935 --> 01:18:53.520
Now what's the trouble?

01:18:53.604 --> 01:18:56.815
I'm not hungry anymore.
Isn't it glorious?

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.819
- Adam!
- It's all right. Come and look.

01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:06.991
â™ª For her Romeo came â™ª

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:10.286
â™ª And â™ª

01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:15.083
â™ª It was closing night â™ª

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:18.711
â™ª The ending of â™ª

01:19:18.796 --> 01:19:21.714
You don't look so bad in this light.

01:19:21.799 --> 01:19:24.217
Why do you think I brought you here?

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:26.636
Maybe you wanted me
to see the kind of work...

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:28.638
the competition was turning out.

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:30.640
Pretty good, huh?

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:33.643
I taught them everything they do.

01:19:33.727 --> 01:19:37.939
Oh, did they do that kind of thing
way back in your day?

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:40.942
Sure. How do you think I got here?

01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:44.154
â™ª I hear it still â™ª

01:19:44.238 --> 01:19:46.739
â™ª I always will â™ª

01:19:46.824 --> 01:19:49.159
- Not allowed to kiss back, huh?
- Oh, no.

01:19:49.243 --> 01:19:52.662
Doctor said it was bad
for my thermostat. Mm-hmm.

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:09.637
Well, when you come on,
you come on, don't you?

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:11.931
Well, come on.

01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:30.658
Yeah.

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:33.328
Hmm?

01:20:33.412 --> 01:20:35.330
In the lobby?

01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:43.171
Are you out of your mind or something?
It's 3:30 in the morning.

01:20:44.924 --> 01:20:46.841
You mean it?

01:20:48.928 --> 01:20:52.805
All right. All right, I'll be right down.
Wait a minute.

01:21:30.261 --> 01:21:33.429
H - H-Hey, turn on the lights!

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:43.523
Hey, how do you stop this thing?

01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:06.462
Three of them, all in their pajamas?
C'est ridicule.

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:08.965
What is it, some new American fad?

01:22:09.049 --> 01:22:12.719
And now your friend who lives here,
uh, the one from Texas...

01:22:12.803 --> 01:22:14.971
he has disappeared into thin air.

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:17.849
- Where is he?
- I wish I knew.

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:20.059
Madame?

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:25.523
Tell me, Mr. Dyle.
Where were you at 3:30 a.m.?

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:27.984
In my room, asleep.

01:22:28.068 --> 01:22:30.403
- And you, Mrs. Lampert?
- I was, too.

01:22:30.487 --> 01:22:32.739
In Mr. Dyle's room?

01:22:32.823 --> 01:22:34.741
No, in my room.

01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:38.328
Obviously you're telling the truth...

01:22:38.412 --> 01:22:41.664
for why would you invent
such a ridiculous story?

01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:46.628
And if I were you,
I wouldn't stay in my pajamas.

01:22:46.712 --> 01:22:48.713
Good night.

01:22:50.424 --> 01:22:53.509
Well, that wraps it up.
Tex has the money.

01:22:53.594 --> 01:22:57.555
- Go to bed. I'll let you know when I've found him.
- You're gonna go looking for him now?

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:01.392
If the police find him first, they're not going to
turn over that quarter of a million to us.

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:04.270
- Oh, Adam -
- Go to bed and bolt your door.

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:14.489
- Yeah?
- Now you listen to me, Dyle.

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:17.867
I know who's got that money, man,
and I want my share.

01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:22.622
Seems to be growin' and growin' every day.
Well, I ain't disappearin' till I get it.

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:25.041
- Where are you, Tex?
- Come on, man.

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:28.670
Look, my mama didn't raise
no stupid children.

01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:30.672
I'll tell you what.

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.674
You wanna find me...

01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:34.676
you just look over your shoulder...

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.679
'cause from now on
I'm gonna be right behind you.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:49.982
Open up.

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:58.658
- I think I was wrong about Tex having the money.
- Why?

01:23:58.742 --> 01:24:01.160
I just heard from him.
He's still hungry.

01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:04.330
That means killing Gideon
didn't get it for him.

01:24:04.415 --> 01:24:07.917
So he's narrowed it down to us.
You've got it.

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:10.461
But I've looked everywhere.
You know I have.

01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:12.422
Where's the airlines bag?

01:24:12.506 --> 01:24:15.049
- In the wardrobe.
- Get it.

01:24:15.134 --> 01:24:17.051
Lord, you're obstinate.

01:24:17.136 --> 01:24:20.221
Charles must have had it with him
on the train when Tex killed him.

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:22.223
Thanks.

01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:26.728
Everybody and his Aunt Lillian's
been through that bag...

01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:28.730
including me.

01:24:28.814 --> 01:24:31.733
- Okay, we'll do it again.
- I've been into it at least once a day.

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:33.735
Somebody would have seen it.

01:24:35.738 --> 01:24:39.115
It's there, Reggie.
We're looking at it right now.

01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:41.784
Something on that bed is worth
a quarter of a million dollars.

01:24:41.869 --> 01:24:45.371
- But what?
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:24:45.456 --> 01:24:47.832
Four passports. No.

01:24:49.877 --> 01:24:51.878
Steamship ticket.

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:55.673
- Anything in there?
- Nothing.

01:24:55.758 --> 01:24:57.592
Wallet.

01:24:59.178 --> 01:25:01.095
Comb? No.

01:25:02.181 --> 01:25:04.098
A fountain pen.

01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:09.145
What about that key?

01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:11.147
To the apartment.
Matches mine exactly.

01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:13.191
Oh.

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:17.111
I bet you don't
really need those.

01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:20.406
You need them.

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:28.247
This still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth
a quarter of a million dollars either.

01:25:30.334 --> 01:25:32.502
- Wait a minute.
- What?

01:25:32.586 --> 01:25:34.796
- The tooth powder.
- What about it?

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.632
Could you recognize heroin
just by the taste of it?

01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:45.431
Heroin.

01:25:45.516 --> 01:25:47.642
- Peppermint-flavored heroin.
- Hmm.

01:25:49.228 --> 01:25:51.187
Well, I guess that's it.

01:25:51.271 --> 01:25:53.189
Dead end.

01:25:53.273 --> 01:25:56.692
Well, go to bed.
You've gotta go to work in the morning.

01:25:56.777 --> 01:25:59.153
There's nothing more we can do tonight.

01:25:59.238 --> 01:26:01.489
I love you, Adam.

01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:04.909
Yes, you told me.

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:08.579
No. The last time I said,
"I love you, Alex."

01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:12.792
Oh.

01:26:24.346 --> 01:26:27.098
- Hold it. They're recognizing Great Britain.
- Oh, la vache.

01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:29.308
Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates...

01:26:29.393 --> 01:26:31.978
and my distinguished colleague from Italy.

01:26:32.062 --> 01:26:36.274
Her Majesty's delegation has listened with
great patience to the Southern European -

01:26:36.358 --> 01:26:38.734
- Oh, are you on?
- No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?

01:26:38.819 --> 01:26:40.736
Nothing. I think I've found something.

01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:43.739
I was snooping around Tex's room
and came across this in the wastebasket.

01:26:43.824 --> 01:26:45.741
I stuck it together again.

01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:48.244
That's the receipt Grandpierre gave me
for Charles's things.

01:26:48.328 --> 01:26:50.746
- I don't see how that's going to -
- You're not looking.

01:26:50.831 --> 01:26:54.417
When we went through the airlines bag,
something was missing - "un agenda. "

01:26:54.501 --> 01:26:58.254
That's an appointment book, isn't it?
It wasn't there.

01:26:58.338 --> 01:27:00.256
That's right.

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:02.258
I remember Grandpierre
looking through it...

01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:05.136
but there was nothing in it
the police thought was very important.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.263
Can you remember anything in it at all?

01:27:07.347 --> 01:27:10.766
Well, it did say something
about Charles's last appointment.

01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:12.768
With whom? Where?

01:27:12.853 --> 01:27:15.771
- I think it only said where.
- Come on, Reggie, think.

01:27:15.856 --> 01:27:17.773
This may be what we're looking for.

01:27:17.858 --> 01:27:20.776
Adam, that money doesn't belong to us.

01:27:20.861 --> 01:27:23.779
- If we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
- Nonsense. We didn't steal it.

01:27:23.864 --> 01:27:26.616
- There's no law against stealing stolen money.
- Of course there is.

01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:27.909
- There is?
- Yes.

01:27:27.993 --> 01:27:30.202
When did they pass such a silly law?
Think, Reggie.

01:27:30.287 --> 01:27:34.123
- What was in that appointment book?
- Oh, it was a place or street corner or something.

01:27:34.207 --> 01:27:36.125
Watch it. I'm on.

01:27:49.514 --> 01:27:53.100
Of - Of the Western
Hemisphere conference -

01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:56.812
Of the Western Hemisphere conference...

01:27:56.897 --> 01:27:58.814
held on March 22 -

01:27:58.899 --> 01:28:01.692
No, wait!
It was last Thursday, 5:00...

01:28:01.777 --> 01:28:04.111
the Jardins des Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es.

01:28:04.196 --> 01:28:06.113
That's it, Adam! The gardens!

01:28:06.198 --> 01:28:09.450
Well, it's Thursday today,
and it's almost 5:00, so come on.

01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:12.453
It's all right, gentlemen. Carry on.

01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:17.583
Now what?

01:28:17.668 --> 01:28:20.503
5:00, Thursday, the gardens.

01:28:20.587 --> 01:28:22.505
Must be something around here.

01:28:22.589 --> 01:28:24.507
Charles's appointment was last week.

01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:27.802
- Yes, I know, but this is all we've got left.
- You're not kidding.

01:28:27.886 --> 01:28:30.304
Ten minutes ago I had a job.

01:28:30.389 --> 01:28:33.307
Now you've got another job,
so stop grumbling and start looking.

01:28:33.392 --> 01:28:36.310
I'll take that side.
You poke around over here.

01:29:15.142 --> 01:29:18.394
It's hopeless.
I don't even know what we're looking for.

01:29:18.478 --> 01:29:20.771
I don't think Tex does either.

01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:23.482
- Tex? Is he here?
- Look.

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:31.741
I'm going to see what he's up to.
You stay here.

01:29:31.825 --> 01:29:34.785
Be careful, Adam.
He's already killed three men.

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:43.437
Wait! Wait!

01:30:43.522 --> 01:30:45.439
Taxi!

01:30:45.524 --> 01:30:47.441
Look out.

01:31:05.085 --> 01:31:07.378
All right, where's the letter?

01:31:08.421 --> 01:31:12.007
The letter, huh?
It ain't worth nothin'.

01:31:12.092 --> 01:31:15.010
You know what I mean.
The envelope with the stamps on it.

01:31:15.095 --> 01:31:17.012
I want it.

01:31:17.097 --> 01:31:19.974
You greenhorn.

01:31:20.058 --> 01:31:24.645
Why, you thick-skulled, harebrained,
half-witted greenhorn.

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:27.565
And they was both too smart for us.

01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:31.402
- What are you talking about?
- First her husband, now her.

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:33.696
She batted all of them big eyes at you...

01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:38.367
and you fell for it like an egg
from a tall chicken.

01:31:38.451 --> 01:31:40.703
You want the envelope?

01:31:40.787 --> 01:31:44.081
There. You take it. It's all yours.

01:31:47.127 --> 01:31:50.421
You killed all three of 'em for nothin'!

01:31:52.674 --> 01:31:54.550
You greenhorn!

01:31:54.634 --> 01:31:57.636
You block-headed jackass!

01:31:57.721 --> 01:32:00.139
You nincompoop!

01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:05.227
Sylvie!
What are you doing here?

01:32:05.312 --> 01:32:07.563
I'm waiting for Jean-Louis.

01:32:07.647 --> 01:32:09.565
Oh. What's he up to?

01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:12.860
He was so excited when he got the stamps
you gave him this morning.

01:32:12.944 --> 01:32:15.821
- He said he'd never seen any like them.
- I'm glad.

01:32:15.906 --> 01:32:17.823
- What's all this?
- The stamp market.

01:32:17.908 --> 01:32:19.867
It's there every Thursday afternoon.

01:32:19.951 --> 01:32:22.286
That's where Jean-Louis trades his stamps.

01:32:23.663 --> 01:32:26.248
- Good Lord, where is he?
- What's the matter, chÃ©rie?

01:32:26.333 --> 01:32:28.584
The stamps!
They're worth a fortune!

01:32:28.668 --> 01:32:31.378
- What?
- A fortune! Come on!

01:32:38.762 --> 01:32:41.680
- Oh, I don't see him anywhere.
- We'll separate.

01:32:41.765 --> 01:32:43.849
- You look over there.
- Okay.

01:32:47.771 --> 01:32:53.734
Jean-Louis.

01:32:53.818 --> 01:32:56.278
Jean-Louis!

01:33:03.703 --> 01:33:07.581
Jean-Louis.

01:33:07.666 --> 01:33:10.584
Reggie. Reggie.

01:33:13.546 --> 01:33:16.465
Jean-Louis, thank heaven.
Do you have the -

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:21.720
- What's this?
- A man gave me all those for only three.

01:33:21.805 --> 01:33:25.516
A man? Oh, no, Jean-Louis.
Who? Where?

01:33:27.936 --> 01:33:30.396
Vite, mon chÃ©ri. Vite.

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:33.232
- LÃ -bas.
- Come on.

01:33:37.279 --> 01:33:40.197
- Oh, but he's gone.
- I don't blame him.

01:33:40.282 --> 01:33:42.700
Entrez.

01:33:44.244 --> 01:33:46.537
- Monsieur Felix?
- Oui.

01:33:48.581 --> 01:33:51.750
I was expecting you.
I knew you would come.

01:33:51.835 --> 01:33:53.752
Look at them, madame.

01:33:53.837 --> 01:33:57.548
Have you ever, in your entire life,
seen anything so beautifuI?

01:33:57.632 --> 01:34:00.551
I'm sorry.
I don't know anything about stamps.

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:04.930
I know them as one knows his own face,
though I had never seen them.

01:34:05.015 --> 01:34:07.349
This one, a Swedish four shilling...

01:34:07.434 --> 01:34:09.476
called Den Gula Fyraskillingen...

01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:11.520
printed in 1854.

01:34:11.604 --> 01:34:14.857
- What is it worth?
- Oh, the money is unimportant.

01:34:14.941 --> 01:34:17.109
I'm afraid it's very important.

01:34:17.193 --> 01:34:20.446
Well, in your money, perhaps $85,000.

01:34:21.573 --> 01:34:23.490
- May I sit down?
- Yes.

01:34:23.575 --> 01:34:26.702
- And the blue one?
- Oh, it's called The Hawaiian Blue.

01:34:26.786 --> 01:34:29.913
In 1894, the owner was murdered
by a rival collector...

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:31.915
who was obsessed to own it.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.959
And what is its value today?

01:34:34.044 --> 01:34:36.628
65,000.

01:34:36.713 --> 01:34:40.257
- And the last one.
- Ah, the best for last.

01:34:40.342 --> 01:34:43.802
Le chef-d'Å“uvre de la collection.
The masterpiece.

01:34:43.887 --> 01:34:46.638
The most valuable stamp
in the world.

01:34:46.723 --> 01:34:48.682
It's called
the Gazette Maldave.

01:34:48.767 --> 01:34:53.645
It was printed by hand on colored paper
and marked with the initials of the printer.

01:34:53.730 --> 01:34:58.359
Today it has a value
of $100,000.

01:34:58.443 --> 01:35:00.944
I'm not a thief, madame.

01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:02.988
I knew there was some mistake.

01:35:07.035 --> 01:35:09.953
You gave the boy a great
many stamps in return.

01:35:10.038 --> 01:35:11.955
- Are they for sale now?
- Let me see.

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:14.541
350 European, 200 Asian...

01:35:14.626 --> 01:35:17.544
175 American, 100 African...

01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:20.547
and 12 Princess Grace commemorative...

01:35:20.632 --> 01:35:22.549
which comes to 10 francs.

01:35:24.928 --> 01:35:27.179
And don't forget these.

01:35:27.263 --> 01:35:29.431
Thank you.

01:35:29.516 --> 01:35:31.392
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

01:35:31.476 --> 01:35:35.687
For a few minutes they were mine.
That is enough.

01:35:40.193 --> 01:35:43.153
Adam? Adam?

01:36:25.572 --> 01:36:27.990
- Hello?
- Mr. Bartholomew?

01:36:28.074 --> 01:36:29.992
Yes.

01:36:30.076 --> 01:36:32.161
Tex is dead. Smothered.

01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:38.876
And Adam did it. He killed them all.

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:42.629
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

01:36:42.714 --> 01:36:46.008
Tex wrote the word "Dyle"
before he died.

01:36:48.595 --> 01:36:50.512
He's the murderer, I tell you.

01:36:50.597 --> 01:36:54.266
Wait a minute, Mrs. Lampert.
You'd better give that to me again.

01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:57.561
It was the stamps on the letter
Charles had with him on the train.

01:36:57.645 --> 01:37:01.356
They were in plain view all the time,
but no one bothered to look at the envelope.

01:37:01.441 --> 01:37:04.693
Mrs. Lampert, listen to me.
You're not safe as long as you have these stamps.

01:37:04.777 --> 01:37:08.489
Let's see. Do you know the center garden
at the Palais Royale?

01:37:08.573 --> 01:37:11.074
- Yes. The colonnade?
- Yes, by the colonnade.

01:37:11.159 --> 01:37:16.121
- As fast as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
- I'm leaving right away. Good-bye.

01:37:29.969 --> 01:37:32.971
Reggie! The stamps!
Where are they? Reggie! Wait!

01:37:33.056 --> 01:37:36.266
So you can kill me, too? Tex is dead.
He wrote "Dyle" on the carpet.

01:37:36.351 --> 01:37:39.811
- I'm not Dyle. You know that.
- But Tex didn't know it. You're a murderer.

01:37:39.896 --> 01:37:41.813
Reggie, I want those stamps!

01:37:41.898 --> 01:37:44.858
- Palais Royale, vite.
- Je suis occupÃ©.

01:37:44.943 --> 01:37:47.110
- Mais c'est trÃ¨s urgent.
- OccupÃ©.

01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:25.065
Whoa!
Billet, monsieur.

01:40:27.105 --> 01:40:29.022
Oh!

01:40:51.754 --> 01:40:53.672
American Embassy.

01:40:53.756 --> 01:40:56.216
A-American Embassy?

01:40:56.300 --> 01:41:00.262
Uh, Mr. Bartholomew's office, please.

01:41:00.346 --> 01:41:04.266
- Would you speak a little louder, please?
- I can't speak any louder.

01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:06.810
Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew.

01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:09.312
I'm sorry.
Mr. Bartholomew has left for the day.

01:41:09.397 --> 01:41:13.233
But someone's trying to kill me.

01:41:13.317 --> 01:41:15.736
- What?
- Kill me!

01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:18.238
You've got to get word
to him right away.

01:41:18.322 --> 01:41:21.950
He's - He's in the center garden
of the Palais Royale near the colonnade.

01:41:22.034 --> 01:41:25.287
Tell him I'm trapped in a phone booth
right below him in the metro station.

01:41:25.371 --> 01:41:27.330
The name's Lampert.

01:42:11.375 --> 01:42:13.627
- Hello?
- Hello. Mr. Bartholomew?

01:42:13.711 --> 01:42:16.880
- Yes.
- There was a call for you
just now, Mr. Bartholomew.

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:19.466
It sounded quite urgent.
A Mrs. Lampert.

01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:22.636
Lampert? I don't know any Mrs. Lampert.

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:26.473
She says she's trapped in a metro station
and someone's trying to kill her.

01:42:26.557 --> 01:42:31.520
Trying to kill her?
Who does she think I am, the C.I.A.?

01:42:31.604 --> 01:42:34.481
All right, I guess you'd better call
the French police.

01:43:26.284 --> 01:43:29.494
Mr. Bartholomew!
Mr. Bartholomew!

01:43:29.579 --> 01:43:31.496
- Help me!
- Reggie, stop.

01:43:32.415 --> 01:43:34.499
That man is Carson Dyle.

01:43:36.586 --> 01:43:39.379
We all know Carson Dyle
is dead, Mrs. Lampert.

01:43:39.463 --> 01:43:42.591
- I tell you, he's Carson Dyle.
- Now, you're not gonna believe him.

01:43:42.675 --> 01:43:45.510
Bring those stamps over here.
He's trying to trick you again.

01:43:45.595 --> 01:43:49.514
Tex recognized him. That's why he wrote Dyle.

01:43:49.599 --> 01:43:52.893
- If you take him those stamps, he'll kill you, too.
- Mrs. Lampert...

01:43:52.977 --> 01:43:57.022
if I'm who he says I am,
what's preventing me from killing you right now?

01:43:57.106 --> 01:44:00.775
Because he'd have to come out to get the stamps,
and he knows he'd never make it.

01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:03.778
Mrs. Lampert,
he wants the money for himself.

01:44:03.863 --> 01:44:05.864
That's all he's ever wanted.

01:44:05.948 --> 01:44:09.701
- He's with the C.I.A. I saw him at the embassy.
- I tell you, he's Carson Dyle.

01:44:09.785 --> 01:44:12.078
That's right, Mrs. Lampert.
That's right.

01:44:12.163 --> 01:44:14.205
I'm a dead man. Look at me.

01:44:18.252 --> 01:44:20.253
Oh, I don't know who anybody is.

01:44:20.338 --> 01:44:22.631
Reggie, I beg you.

01:44:22.715 --> 01:44:24.633
Just trust me once more.

01:44:24.717 --> 01:44:26.885
Why should I?

01:44:26.969 --> 01:44:30.221
I can't think of a reason
in the world why you should.

01:44:36.479 --> 01:44:38.730
Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert,
or I'll kill you.

01:44:38.814 --> 01:44:41.983
It won't get you the stamps, Dyle.
You'll have to come out to get them...

01:44:42.068 --> 01:44:44.194
and I'm not likely to miss at this range.

01:44:44.278 --> 01:44:46.988
Maybe not, but it takes
a lot of bullets to kill me.

01:44:47.073 --> 01:44:50.200
They left me there with five of them
in my legs and my stomach.

01:44:50.284 --> 01:44:52.994
Mrs. Lampert, they knew I was alive,
but they left me there.

01:44:53.079 --> 01:44:55.956
I spent 10 months in a German prison camp
with nothing to stop the pain.

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:58.667
They left me there, Mrs. Lampert.
They deserved to die.

01:44:58.751 --> 01:45:02.504
- But I had nothing to do with it.
- You've got the money now. It belongs to me.

01:45:02.588 --> 01:45:06.299
Mrs. Lampert, they knew I was still alive,
but they left me there.

01:45:06.384 --> 01:45:09.636
That's why I had to kill them,
all four of them.

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:13.098
Please believe me. I'll kill you, too.
It won't make any difference.

01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:18.019
It's no use.
You're running out of time.

01:45:18.104 --> 01:45:21.606
I've come too far to turn back.
I swear, I'll kill you.

01:45:23.985 --> 01:45:26.528
Make up your mind, Mrs. Lampert. Now.

01:45:26.612 --> 01:45:28.279
Adam!

01:47:49.004 --> 01:47:52.090
All right.

01:47:52.174 --> 01:47:55.260
I know you're in there, Mrs. Lampert.
Come on out.

01:48:12.403 --> 01:48:14.863
Do you hear me? Come on out.

01:48:27.168 --> 01:48:30.628
I don't want to kill you, but I will.

01:48:35.467 --> 01:48:37.218
Come on out.

01:49:13.714 --> 01:49:16.132
The game is over, Mrs. Lampert.

01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:52.085
You didn't have to chase me so hard.

01:49:52.169 --> 01:49:55.088
- That one's done. Do this one.
- Oh.

01:49:55.172 --> 01:49:58.091
I'm sorry I thought
you were the murderer...

01:49:58.175 --> 01:50:01.594
but how was I to know
he was as big a liar as you are?

01:50:01.679 --> 01:50:04.597
Is that all the gratitude I get
for saving your hide?

01:50:04.682 --> 01:50:09.269
- Rub your own blinking foot.
- The truth now. Was it my hide, or those stamps?

01:50:09.353 --> 01:50:12.272
What a terrible thing to say.
How could you think that?

01:50:12.356 --> 01:50:14.274
Then prove it to me.

01:50:14.358 --> 01:50:18.278
Tell me to go to the embassy first thing
in the morning and turn in those stamps.

01:50:20.155 --> 01:50:23.992
- I said, tell me to go to the embassy first -
- I heard you, I heard you.

01:50:24.076 --> 01:50:25.994
Then say it.

01:50:26.078 --> 01:50:29.205
Now, Reggie, listen to me.

01:50:29.290 --> 01:50:32.500
- There's something I'd like to explain.
- Never mind. I'll go by myself.

01:50:32.584 --> 01:50:35.670
What makes you think they're even interested?
It's only a quarter million.

01:50:35.754 --> 01:50:39.090
It'll cost more than that for them
to fix their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer -

01:50:39.174 --> 01:50:41.467
Who's a taxpayer?
Crooks don't pay taxes.

01:50:42.219 --> 01:50:44.137
- Excuse me, soldier -
- Marine, ma'am.

01:50:44.221 --> 01:50:48.474
Forgive me. Who would I see regarding
the return of stolen government money?

01:50:48.559 --> 01:50:50.476
You might try the Treasury Department.

01:50:50.561 --> 01:50:52.687
Room 217, second floor, Mr. Cruikshank.

01:50:52.771 --> 01:50:55.106
217. Thank you, marine.

01:51:01.196 --> 01:51:04.115
Uh - Uh, do you mind
if I don't go in with you?

01:51:04.199 --> 01:51:08.119
The sight of all that money being given away
might make me break out.

01:51:10.456 --> 01:51:13.374
Mr. Cruikshank, please.
My name is Lampert.

01:51:13.459 --> 01:51:15.376
Yes.

01:51:15.461 --> 01:51:18.379
- Mr. Cruikshank, a Miss Lamp -
- Mrs.

01:51:18.464 --> 01:51:20.590
Mrs. Lampert to see you.

01:51:20.674 --> 01:51:22.967
- Yes, sir. Go right in.
- Thank you.

01:51:33.437 --> 01:51:36.856
Of all the mean...

01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:38.858
rotten...

01:51:38.942 --> 01:51:41.694
contemptible, crooked -

01:51:41.779 --> 01:51:45.114
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad
to find out I'm not crooked.

01:51:45.199 --> 01:51:47.575
You can't even be honest
about being dishonest.

01:51:47.659 --> 01:51:49.577
Why didn't you say something?

01:51:49.661 --> 01:51:53.331
- We're not allowed to tell.
Come on, give me the stamps.
- Hmm.

01:51:54.833 --> 01:51:58.419
Wait a minute. How did Carson Dyle
get an office in this building anyway?

01:51:58.504 --> 01:52:01.756
- When did you meet him?
What time of day, I mean.
- About 1:00.

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:05.259
The lunch hour.
Probably worked it out in advance.

01:52:05.344 --> 01:52:08.679
Found an office usually left open
and moved in for the time you were here.

01:52:08.764 --> 01:52:12.392
Then how do I know this is your office?

01:52:12.476 --> 01:52:17.146
Mrs. Foster, take a memo to Bartholomew
in Security recommending -

01:52:17.231 --> 01:52:19.482
Bartholomew.

01:52:19.566 --> 01:52:22.443
Recommending that embassy offices
be kept locked during the lunch hour.

01:52:22.528 --> 01:52:24.946
Mmm. Starting with his own.

01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:27.907
- Give me the stamps. Come on.
- What's your first name today?

01:52:27.991 --> 01:52:30.326
- Brian.
- Brian Cruikshank.

01:52:30.411 --> 01:52:32.912
Serves me right
if I get stuck with that one.

01:52:32.996 --> 01:52:35.873
- Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
- Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?

01:52:35.958 --> 01:52:37.875
- Yes.
- But we're divorced.

01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:39.836
No.

01:52:40.879 --> 01:52:42.839
Oh.

01:52:44.633 --> 01:52:46.384
My mother. She lives in Detroit.

01:52:46.468 --> 01:52:49.762
You'd like her. She'd like you, too.
Come on, give me those stamps.

01:52:49.847 --> 01:52:53.057
Not until you prove to me
that you're really Brian Cruikshank.

01:52:53.142 --> 01:52:56.477
One day next week I'll put it
on a marriage license. How about that?

01:52:56.562 --> 01:52:58.479
Quit stalling.
I want some identification now.

01:52:58.564 --> 01:53:02.442
- I wouldn't lie on a license.
- You can't prove it. You're still trying to -

01:53:02.526 --> 01:53:04.944
"Marriage license"?

01:53:05.028 --> 01:53:07.405
Did you say "marriage license"?

01:53:07.489 --> 01:53:10.450
Don't change the subject.
Just give me the stamps.

01:53:10.534 --> 01:53:15.121
Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter, Brian,
whatever your name is.

01:53:19.209 --> 01:53:21.127
We can name them all after you.

01:53:21.211 --> 01:53:24.130
