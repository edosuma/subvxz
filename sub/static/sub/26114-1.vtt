<i>Oh, no.</i>

02:35.714 --> 02:37.616
<i>Go away.
Get out of here.</i>

03:52.061 --> 03:54.461
<i>All right. Test.</i>

03:57.533 --> 03:59.802
<i>Amaya is gonna love this.</i>

04:01.437 --> 04:03.572
<i>Nice, that was fast.</i>

04:05.075 --> 04:06.440
<i>Okay, let's see here.</i>

04:06.442 --> 04:08.409
<i>This thing runs so much faster</i>

04:08.411 --> 04:10.945
<i>than my old piece of crap.</i>

04:13.950 --> 04:15.318
<i>Okay.</i>

04:33.805 --> 04:35.473
<i>Holy cow.</i>

05:19.186 --> 05:21.452
<i>There you are.</i>

05:21.454 --> 05:22.754
<i>It's nice to see your face.</i>

05:27.061 --> 05:29.761
<i>I know, I know.</i>

05:29.763 --> 05:31.496
<i>Just remember
who has two thumbs</i>

05:31.498 --> 05:33.599
<i>and gives the best massages
in the world.</i>

05:33.601 --> 05:34.836
<i>Hmm?</i>

05:38.807 --> 05:42.410
<i>Hang on.</i>

05:43.111 --> 05:45.511
<i>Okay.</i>

05:45.513 --> 05:47.547
<i>So I haven't ironed out
all the bugs yet</i>

05:47.549 --> 05:50.050
<i>but, um, okay,
you know what, just...</i>

05:50.052 --> 05:52.619
<i>You ready?</i>

05:52.621 --> 05:54.520
<i>Okay.</i>

05:54.522 --> 05:56.657
<i>I got a new computer today.</i>

05:56.659 --> 05:58.959
<i>It's much faster
than my old one.</i>

06:03.566 --> 06:05.132
<i>Can you, uh,
do you understand it?</i>

06:08.938 --> 06:10.939
<i>Oh, I just... I just added
a new feature.</i>

06:10.941 --> 06:13.909
<i>So, uh, when the app
doesn't understand a word,</i>

06:13.911 --> 06:15.609
<i>you just... you just type it in</i>

06:15.611 --> 06:17.846
<i>and it automatically
connects you to the ASL site,</i>

06:17.848 --> 06:20.982
<i>and then there is a
video tutorial on how to do it.</i>

06:22.552 --> 06:24.085
<i>Oh, damn it, damn it.
Hold on, hold on.</i>

06:24.087 --> 06:25.120
<i>One sec, sorry.</i>

06:25.122 --> 06:26.523
<i>Um...</i>

06:27.691 --> 06:29.691
<i>Anyway,
I got the idea from, uh,</i>

06:29.693 --> 06:31.559
<i>from when you told me
how hard it was</i>

06:31.561 --> 06:32.929
<i>for you to understand me</i>

06:32.931 --> 06:34.431
<i>when I'm on Skype.</i>

06:38.569 --> 06:39.871
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

06:45.576 --> 06:47.445
<i>Amaya, can you... can you type?</i>

06:48.846 --> 06:50.481
<i>You know I can't...</i>

07:12.005 --> 07:13.871
<i>Amaya... slow down,</i>

07:13.873 --> 07:15.773
<i>there's door...</i>

07:22.615 --> 07:25.019
<i>Sorry, yeah,
it's the door, door.</i>

07:27.088 --> 07:28.089
<i>I...</i>

07:30.791 --> 07:32.891
<i>Okay. All right, all right,
all right, all right.</i>

07:32.893 --> 07:34.893
<i>I'm not moving.</i>

07:52.948 --> 07:55.315
<i>Oh, no, no, no. Come on.</i>

07:55.317 --> 07:56.685
<i>No, no, no.</i>

07:58.053 --> 08:00.653
<i>Come on... come on. Ah, shh.</i>

08:00.655 --> 08:04.058
<i>What is wrong with you?
Come on, let's go!</i>

08:16.672 --> 08:19.374
<i>Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.</i>

11:20.166 --> 11:23.535
<i>Okay, how about, uh...
we go analog, huh?</i>

11:23.537 --> 11:25.537
<i>- Little doo-doo-doo.
- There's a...</i>

11:25.539 --> 11:27.572
<i>There's a warm-up round
before AJ's?</i>

11:27.574 --> 11:29.274
<i>You guys, I got this for Nari
for her birthday</i>

11:29.276 --> 11:31.875
<i>because I guess
I'm trying to compensate.</i>

11:31.877 --> 11:34.279
<i>Rolling on the floor
laughing my ass off.</i>

11:34.281 --> 11:35.847
<i>All right. Um, uh...</i>

11:35.849 --> 11:38.116
<i>Hi, MTV.
My name is Kendra.</i>

11:38.118 --> 11:40.486
<i>I live in Malibu.
I'm into blank</i>

11:40.488 --> 11:42.320
<i>and I love to have a good time.</i>

11:42.322 --> 11:44.523
<i>Okay, Matias, do you wanna
go first and then...</i>

11:44.525 --> 11:47.892
<i>- Matias.
- Hi, my name is Kendra.</i>

11:47.894 --> 11:50.029
<i>I'm from Malibu.</i>

11:50.031 --> 11:53.032
<i>I'm into having sex
on top of a pizza</i>

11:53.034 --> 11:56.202
<i>and I love having
a really good time.</i>

11:56.204 --> 11:58.170
<i>Hi, my name is Kendra.
I'm from Malibu.</i>

11:58.172 --> 12:00.172
<i>I'm really into
the systematic destruction</i>

12:00.174 --> 12:02.275
<i>of an entire people
and their way of life...</i>

12:06.582 --> 12:09.251
<i>...and I'm ready
to have a good time.</i>

12:11.453 --> 12:13.587
<i>Uh, hi, my name is Kendra.</i>

12:13.589 --> 12:15.389
<i>I'm, uh, from Malibu,</i>

12:15.391 --> 12:19.126
<i>and I'm into snorting coke off
a clown's boner and...</i>

12:19.128 --> 12:21.329
<i>- What?
- ...I love having a good time.</i>

12:21.331 --> 12:26.067
<i>Matias, I can see the pores
on your face.</i>

12:26.069 --> 12:29.237
<i>- What is going on over there?
- But like in a good way.</i>

12:29.239 --> 12:32.340
<i>That actually looks like you're
calling from the year 2018.</i>

12:32.342 --> 12:34.342
<i>I mean, it's a full
30 frames a second.</i>

12:34.344 --> 12:35.977
<i>I don't think
you're ready for this.</i>

12:35.979 --> 12:37.412
<i>Oh, my God, and stereo even.</i>

12:37.414 --> 12:39.615
<i>I got a new laptop.</i>

12:39.617 --> 12:40.948
<i>What, actually new?</i>

12:40.950 --> 12:42.950
<i>Eh, it's, like, newish, yeah.</i>

12:42.952 --> 12:45.087
<i>- Yeah, Craigslist.
- Ow, ow!</i>

12:45.089 --> 12:48.223
<i>But unfortunately, like, everyone now, 'cause
they can see what he really looks like,</i>

12:48.225 --> 12:51.360
<i>everyone on Facebook's just
like, blup, unfriending him.</i>

12:51.362 --> 12:54.496
<i>Oi, so what? Are you guys gonna
come over or what?</i>

12:54.498 --> 12:56.365
<i>Um, we were gonna come over</i>

12:56.367 --> 12:58.100
<i>- but then, um...
- No!</i>

12:58.102 --> 13:00.503
<i>...I started having
some severe...</i>

13:00.505 --> 13:02.205
<i>- No!
- ...heartburn and...</i>

13:02.207 --> 13:04.074
<i>I told you
he was gonna do this.</i>

13:04.076 --> 13:05.575
<i>I never bail when it's
at one of yours.</i>

13:05.577 --> 13:06.676
<i>Lexx, come on,
help me out here.</i>

13:06.678 --> 13:07.944
<i>I mean, I'm cool with Skyping.</i>

13:07.946 --> 13:10.380
<i>It's subway and bus
from my place, so I'm...</i>

13:10.382 --> 13:11.448
<i>Skype clearly works for me...</i>

13:11.450 --> 13:14.050
<i>You guys are so old.</i>

13:14.052 --> 13:16.687
<i>AJ, it's... AJ, it's 3:00
in the morning in London.</i>

13:16.689 --> 13:18.456
<i>Damon stayed up just for you.</i>

13:18.458 --> 13:20.358
<i>Oh, come on, guys, guys,</i>

13:20.360 --> 13:22.460
<i>I got chips and I've got dips</i>

13:22.462 --> 13:24.595
<i>and I, uh,</i>

13:24.597 --> 13:25.663
<i>I got some killer...</i>

13:25.665 --> 13:27.064
<i>I got some killer buds.</i>

13:27.066 --> 13:29.066
<i>Some what? Say that louder.</i>

13:29.068 --> 13:30.468
<i>What?</i>

13:30.470 --> 13:32.470
<i>What? What?</i>

13:32.472 --> 13:34.338
<i>I got some killer bud.</i>

13:34.340 --> 13:37.542
<i>Yeah, I know. I heard you. I
just wanted Linda to hear, too.</i>

13:37.544 --> 13:39.143
<i>She's not gonna...</i>

13:39.145 --> 13:42.014
<i>She still thinks marijuana
is illegal here.</i>

13:42.716 --> 13:45.150
<i>Uh, and also, Serena, hello,</i>

13:45.152 --> 13:46.485
<i>I sliced you a rabbit bowl.</i>

13:49.423 --> 13:50.424
<i>Really?</i>

14:47.083 --> 14:49.685
<i>And third, guys, how many times
do I have to tell you?</i>

14:49.687 --> 14:51.754
<i>It is not just the government.</i>

14:51.756 --> 14:54.723
<i>It is the circadians
and the Bilderbergs</i>

14:54.725 --> 14:57.159
<i>and the Illuminati
and corporations.</i>

14:57.161 --> 14:59.728
<i>Why do you think Facebook
and Twitter are free?</i>

14:59.730 --> 15:02.398
<i>- Because you're the product.
- 'Cause we're the product.</i>

15:02.400 --> 15:05.635
<i>Yes! They own
every single thing you post!</i>

15:05.637 --> 15:07.303
<i>And everybody assumes that,</i>

15:07.305 --> 15:09.573
<i>"Oh, it's just...
it's just pictures and shit."</i>

15:09.575 --> 15:11.808
<i>All they really care about
is targeted marketing.</i>

15:11.810 --> 15:14.143
<i>But the Internet,
as you know it,</i>

15:14.145 --> 15:17.113
<i>is just the surface.
You guys are just like...</i>

15:17.115 --> 15:19.115
<i>Oh, you just float
around up there</i>

15:19.117 --> 15:21.284
<i>without a care in the world
but it is a...</i>

15:21.286 --> 15:24.120
<i>It is a...
it is a deep goddamn ocean</i>

15:24.122 --> 15:26.122
<i>and there are sharks
swimming below you.</i>

15:26.124 --> 15:28.158
<i>They're just gonna...
They're gonna come in</i>

15:28.160 --> 15:30.828
<i>from right up behind you when
you don't even see it coming,</i>

15:30.830 --> 15:35.266
<i>and they're just... Hello?!</i>

15:35.268 --> 15:37.134
<i>No, no, I'm here.
I mean, keep going.</i>

15:37.136 --> 15:39.136
<i>Well, they're gonna come,
they're gonna get you,</i>

15:39.138 --> 15:41.138
<i>and then it's just sayonara,
you know.</i>

15:41.140 --> 15:42.708
<i>It's... That's it!</i>

15:42.710 --> 15:44.408
<i>It's not just sharks
down there, guys.</i>

15:44.410 --> 15:48.145
<i>There are leviathans
and krakens and colossuses.</i>

15:48.147 --> 15:50.549
<i>Um, right, I believe the proper
plural is "colossi", mate.</i>

15:50.551 --> 15:54.820
<i>You know what,
Google "Skyhook," okay?</i>

15:54.822 --> 15:55.854
<i>You will shit yourself.</i>

15:55.856 --> 15:57.689
<i>It is total integration</i>

15:57.691 --> 16:00.158
<i>of Wi-Fi and cell towers,</i>

16:00.160 --> 16:02.294
<i>GPS, IP address detection,</i>

16:02.296 --> 16:04.129
<i>Bluetooth device tracking,</i>

16:04.131 --> 16:05.264
<i>even those Fitbit things</i>

16:05.266 --> 16:06.699
<i>you like to run around with,</i>

16:06.701 --> 16:08.635
<i>they can track you
through that.</i>

16:08.637 --> 16:10.303
<i>What are you doing, Lexx?</i>

16:10.305 --> 16:11.704
<i>Come on.</i>

16:11.706 --> 16:13.172
<i>Stop it. That's not funny.</i>

16:13.174 --> 16:14.374
<i>Well played. Well played.</i>

16:14.376 --> 16:18.645
<i>It's not funny, Serena.</i>

16:18.647 --> 16:19.880
<i>Help me!</i>

16:19.882 --> 16:22.315
<i>I just want to...</i>

16:22.317 --> 16:24.552
<i>...get it through your heads!</i>

16:24.554 --> 16:26.022
<i>Oh.</i>

16:28.457 --> 16:29.490
<i>Someday.</i>

16:29.492 --> 16:30.591
<i>Someday what?</i>

16:30.593 --> 16:32.860
<i>You hope we get eaten?</i>

16:32.862 --> 16:34.828
<i>No, actually,
I really hope you don't.</i>

16:34.830 --> 16:36.463
<i>Aw, you're worried!</i>

16:36.465 --> 16:38.867
<i>Like a big, ol' cuddly
teddy bear, huh?</i>

16:38.869 --> 16:41.235
<i>Yeah, a teddy bear
in a survivalist bunker</i>

16:41.237 --> 16:42.957
<i>with a year's supply
of food, guns and ammo.</i>

16:47.878 --> 16:49.311
<i>Oh.</i>

16:49.313 --> 16:52.247
<i>No! No!</i>

16:52.249 --> 16:54.516
<i>No...</i>

16:54.518 --> 16:57.285
<i>- What was that?
- That was my...</i>

16:57.287 --> 17:01.657
<i>That's my impression of Nari
being attacked by a dick.</i>

17:01.659 --> 17:03.394
<i>Oh, right.</i>

17:07.397 --> 17:08.897
<i>Yes. Aw!</i>

17:25.451 --> 17:29.286
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

17:29.288 --> 17:30.589
<i>Is no one offended by...</i>

18:26.682 --> 18:28.515
<i>Oh, wait, oh, wait!
Oh, wait! Uh, hold on.</i>

18:28.517 --> 18:30.017
<i>I'm gonna play it now, okay?
Check it out.</i>

18:30.019 --> 18:31.986
<i>I just got these new speakers.</i>

18:34.556 --> 18:36.322
<i>Turn it down!</i>

18:36.324 --> 18:38.793
<i>- AJ, turn it down!
- All right. All right.</i>

18:38.795 --> 18:40.661
<i>All right. All right.
Hold on, hold on. Hold on.</i>

18:40.663 --> 18:42.697
<i>You guys see that, though?
Look at my new box.</i>

18:42.699 --> 18:43.998
<i>Bam! Bam!</i>

18:44.000 --> 18:46.434
<i>Bam! Yeah, right?</i>

18:46.436 --> 18:48.937
<i>You would love the way your
shit sounds up close, Lexx,</i>

18:48.939 --> 18:51.439
<i>or you would if you were
comin' over but you're not.</i>

18:51.441 --> 18:53.942
<i>I can't. Subway and bus
from my place, remember that?</i>

18:53.944 --> 18:56.745
<i>Before we start,
there is something</i>

18:56.747 --> 18:58.847
<i>that we wanna tell you guys.</i>

18:58.849 --> 19:00.382
<i>- Oh, wait, wait, wait!
- Ooh.</i>

19:00.384 --> 19:01.550
<i>Should we wait for Amaya?</i>

19:01.552 --> 19:03.587
<i>I don't think Amaya's
gonna be comin'.</i>

19:06.057 --> 19:09.959
<i>- Bam!
- Oh, yeah!</i>

19:09.961 --> 19:11.426
<i>Bam!</i>

19:11.428 --> 19:13.696
<i>Bam!</i>

19:13.698 --> 19:15.498
<i>- That is amazing.
- Can I... Can I see it?</i>

19:15.500 --> 19:17.900
<i>- Closer. Closer.
- Closer, closer, closer!</i>

19:17.902 --> 19:19.368
<i>I wanna see it.</i>

19:19.370 --> 19:21.003
<i>- Oh, it's great.
- Wow!</i>

19:21.005 --> 19:22.638
<i>I am so happy for you guys.</i>

19:22.640 --> 19:24.307
<i>- She asked me.
- Okay, no, no, no, no, wait,</i>

19:24.309 --> 19:26.309
<i>you gotta tell us everything.</i>

19:26.311 --> 19:29.378
<i>I was having my morning cup
of inspirational tea</i>

19:29.380 --> 19:31.982
<i>and I swig back
the little last bit of it.</i>

19:31.984 --> 19:34.017
<i>Basically,
I almost choke on this</i>

19:34.019 --> 19:35.318
<i>because it was in the cup.</i>

19:35.320 --> 19:37.788
<i>Were you just watching her
drink it the whole time,</i>

19:37.790 --> 19:39.690
<i>just going like,
"She's gonna find it soon."</i>

19:39.692 --> 19:42.359
<i>Well, yeah. But... she puts
milk in her tea, you know.</i>

19:42.361 --> 19:44.394
<i>- So it's like cloudy.
- Awesome, guys.</i>

19:44.396 --> 19:45.897
<i>It's my mom's ring.</i>

19:45.899 --> 19:47.932
<i>- It's your mom's ring?
- Aw! That's, aw, that's...</i>

19:47.934 --> 19:49.734
<i>Oh, my God!
Did you... Wait, did you, uh,</i>

19:49.736 --> 19:52.436
<i>did you ask Nari's dad for
permission and did you film it?</i>

19:52.438 --> 19:54.706
<i>Please say you did because
oh, my God, I just...</i>

19:54.708 --> 19:56.941
<i>I loved the look on his face
when he found out</i>

19:56.943 --> 19:59.577
<i>that you two weren't,
uh, roommates and I just...</i>

19:59.579 --> 20:01.346
<i>I would really
love to see that.</i>

20:01.348 --> 20:02.714
<i>AJ, it's not the time.</i>

20:02.716 --> 20:03.983
<i>It was cool when you
stood up to him,</i>

20:03.985 --> 20:07.352
<i>that's all I'm sayin'.
It was just sweet.</i>

20:07.354 --> 20:09.891
<i>Serena, is your...
Is your mom excited?</i>

20:11.492 --> 20:15.094
<i>- Yeah, she's really excited.
- Cool.</i>

20:15.096 --> 20:18.432
<i>I just, um...
You know...</i>

20:21.602 --> 20:24.637
<i>Uh, the cancer has progressed,
so it's...</i>

20:24.639 --> 20:27.573
<i>It's... um,</i>

20:27.575 --> 20:29.543
<i>it's moved
into her brain and,</i>

20:29.545 --> 20:31.444
<i>uh, they have her
on life support, though,</i>

20:31.446 --> 20:33.780
<i>and they're really trying
some aggressive treatment,</i>

20:33.782 --> 20:34.850
<i>so it's...</i>

20:36.919 --> 20:38.451
<i>I wish I'd asked her sooner</i>

20:38.453 --> 20:40.789
<i>so we just had more time,
you know.</i>

20:42.724 --> 20:45.627
<i>I remember when
I had to put my dog down.</i>

20:54.470 --> 20:56.938
<i>Oh, my God.
You're so bad at this.</i>

20:56.940 --> 21:00.008
<i>I am so... No, I am so thrilled
for you guys, you have no idea.</i>

21:00.010 --> 21:03.812
<i>I always thought Matias and
Amaya would be the first to...</i>

21:06.050 --> 21:09.151
<i>Nice recovery, mate,
but still it sucks.</i>

21:09.153 --> 21:11.420
<i>Well, oh!
And hey, um, by the way,</i>

21:11.422 --> 21:13.856
<i>by the way...</i>

21:15.893 --> 21:16.993
<i>What is that sound?</i>

21:16.995 --> 21:18.594
<i>Universal Life Church,</i>

21:18.596 --> 21:20.163
<i>fully certified,
took five minutes online,</i>

21:20.165 --> 21:21.965
<i>I can totally marry you guys,
that's right.</i>

21:21.967 --> 21:23.766
<i>That says "wedding officiant"?</i>

21:23.768 --> 21:25.535
<i>- Yep.
- Yeah, there's nothing</i>

21:25.537 --> 21:27.203
<i>more romantic
than being married</i>

21:27.205 --> 21:29.138
<i>by the last guy
you ever slept with.</i>

21:29.140 --> 21:31.776
<i>Uh, that is the only guy, Lexx.</i>

21:34.113 --> 21:35.812
<i>Nari?</i>

21:35.814 --> 21:37.680
<i>Ooh!</i>

21:37.682 --> 21:38.682
<i>Nari?</i>

21:39.986 --> 21:41.653
<i>Nari...</i>

21:45.224 --> 21:46.790
<i>No, no.</i>

21:46.792 --> 21:48.626
<i>No.</i>

21:56.003 --> 21:59.170
<i>This is Amaya's
favorite sunset spot.</i>

22:09.217 --> 22:10.749
<i>What?</i>

22:51.261 --> 22:53.794
<i>Hi.</i>

22:53.796 --> 22:56.697
<i>Look, I know... I know you're mad
at me, and I know, we've both...</i>

22:56.699 --> 22:58.600
<i>we've both been busy,
but I feel like...</i>

23:01.705 --> 23:04.138
<i>I know, I... I've been spending</i>

23:04.140 --> 23:05.274
<i>a lot of time on this app,</i>

23:05.276 --> 23:07.075
<i>but I've been doing it</i>

23:07.077 --> 23:08.743
<i>so that we can...</i>

23:08.745 --> 23:10.480
<i>So that we can
communicate better.</i>

23:16.187 --> 23:17.788
<i>Amaya.</i>

23:34.973 --> 23:38.577
<i>I went... I went
to the ASL class, uh...</i>

23:45.784 --> 23:47.519
<i>No. No, I'm just, uh...</i>

23:55.228 --> 23:56.963
<i>Uh, Amaya!</i>

24:09.609 --> 24:10.811
<i>Damn it.</i>

26:03.897 --> 26:05.796
<i>Hey, guys,
I'm gonna head out real quick.</i>

26:05.798 --> 26:07.865
<i>Uh, what's up?
Where are you going?</i>

26:07.867 --> 26:10.835
<i>Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'll explain later.</i>

26:10.837 --> 26:12.203
<i>All right. Bye then.</i>

26:12.205 --> 26:14.473
<i>Is everything okay, Matias?</i>

26:14.475 --> 26:17.209
<i>Uh, sometimes that guy.</i>

26:17.211 --> 26:21.182
<i>I believe in the truth
and Damon believes in the lies.</i>

26:22.816 --> 26:24.783
<i>Damon believes
in the hard lies</i>

26:24.785 --> 26:27.419
<i>and I believe
in the crazy truth.</i>

27:46.170 --> 27:48.037
<i>All right.
No, no, it's not impossible,</i>

27:48.039 --> 27:49.473
<i>it's just...
it is improbable, but...</i>

27:49.475 --> 27:51.841
<i>Thank you, Captain Spock.</i>

27:51.843 --> 27:53.909
<i>Uh, that is Ambassador Spock.</i>

27:53.911 --> 27:55.612
<i>And we are nothing
without our chain of command.</i>

27:55.614 --> 27:59.850
<i>Hah, you're such a nerd, dude.</i>

27:59.852 --> 28:02.286
<i>Hey, what the hell?</i>

28:02.288 --> 28:04.988
<i>Sounds like someone
is meditating or something.</i>

28:04.990 --> 28:07.124
<i>Matias, are you okay?</i>

28:07.126 --> 28:08.925
<i>I thought you
were going somewhere.</i>

28:08.927 --> 28:10.328
<i>What's goin' on?</i>

28:22.976 --> 28:25.243
<i>Mate, Matias, what's going on?</i>

28:25.245 --> 28:27.914
<i>Do you wanna share...
share your screen, mate?</i>

28:31.918 --> 28:35.254
<i>Whoa! That looks like the
wallpaper's actually moving.</i>

28:35.256 --> 28:37.556
<i>Yeah, it is.
It switched when I connected.</i>

28:37.558 --> 28:39.325
<i>Connected to what?</i>

28:39.327 --> 28:42.330
<i>I, uh, I have no idea,
this river thing.</i>

28:44.065 --> 28:46.232
<i>All right.
That's an overlay network.</i>

28:46.234 --> 28:48.067
<i>You've been bouncing it
everywhere.</i>

28:48.069 --> 28:50.270
<i>- What's an overlay network?
- Uh, hey, Damon,</i>

28:50.272 --> 28:52.305
<i>Damon, you gotta
translate that, man.</i>

28:52.307 --> 28:54.441
<i>Oh, um, sorry, uh,</i>

28:54.443 --> 28:56.609
<i>it's so no one can track you.</i>

28:56.611 --> 28:58.278
<i>Shit! This is...</i>

28:58.280 --> 29:01.247
<i>- Dude, this is darknet.
- Yeah, probably.</i>

29:01.249 --> 29:03.451
<i>- Damon, what's darknet?
- Uh, it is part of the Internet</i>

29:03.453 --> 29:06.454
<i>that isn't or can't be
indexed by a search engine.</i>

29:06.456 --> 29:09.023
<i>It's where you find marketplaces
for bad shit, basically,</i>

29:09.025 --> 29:11.292
<i>like, um, Silk Road.
Damon, you know about that.</i>

29:11.294 --> 29:12.960
<i>It was all about drugs,
illegal IDs,</i>

29:12.962 --> 29:14.328
<i>stolen credit cards, exploits,</i>

29:14.330 --> 29:15.930
<i>even assassination for hire.</i>

29:15.932 --> 29:17.198
<i>Lolita City,
which is all about child porn</i>

29:17.200 --> 29:19.333
<i>- and, like, fan fiction...
- Okay, AJ, we got it.</i>

29:19.335 --> 29:21.403
<i>- Yeah, definitely... yeah.
- Yeah, maybe you should</i>

29:21.405 --> 29:23.940
<i>just leave whatever
that is alone, Matias.</i>

29:28.712 --> 29:30.178
<i>Oh, whoa! Okay.</i>

29:30.180 --> 29:32.280
<i>It looks like
an old-school PBS.</i>

29:32.282 --> 29:35.052
<i>Charon is the ferryman
of the dead.</i>

29:40.991 --> 29:43.393
<i>"The ferryman of Hades
who carries souls</i>

29:43.395 --> 29:46.229
<i>of the newly deceased
across the river Styx..."</i>

29:46.231 --> 29:48.364
<i>Styx, sorry.</i>

29:48.366 --> 29:50.199
<i>"...and Acheron that divides</i>

29:50.201 --> 29:53.338
<i>the world of the living
from the world of the dead."</i>

29:56.474 --> 29:58.475
<i>Dude, whose computer
did you buy?</i>

29:58.477 --> 30:02.111
<i>I didn't... I didn't buy it. I...</i>

30:02.113 --> 30:05.014
<i>There's, um, there's a cyber
cafe that I've been...</i>

30:05.016 --> 30:07.718
<i>that I've been working at
and I... I don't know,</i>

30:07.720 --> 30:08.986
<i>and I noticed this computer</i>

30:08.988 --> 30:12.122
<i>was sitting in the lost
and found for the last,</i>

30:12.124 --> 30:14.091
<i>I don't know, three or...
three or four weeks.</i>

30:14.093 --> 30:16.293
<i>Wait, well, hang on,
you stole someone's computer?</i>

30:16.295 --> 30:18.295
<i>No, I didn't...
I didn't steal it, I just...</i>

30:18.297 --> 30:20.365
<i>Hold on, mate. You told me
you bought it on Craigslist.</i>

30:20.367 --> 30:22.200
<i>I felt like shit
the moment I took it.</i>

30:22.202 --> 30:23.635
<i>I don't know
what I was hoping for.</i>

30:23.637 --> 30:25.403
<i>I just... I kept having
to go there</i>

30:25.405 --> 30:28.139
<i>because I wanted a better
computer to work on my app with</i>

30:28.141 --> 30:31.075
<i>and then my thing was just
moving so goddamn slow</i>

30:31.077 --> 30:33.344
<i>that I thought whoever's
laptop this was, I mean...</i>

30:33.346 --> 30:37.115
<i>But look here, look,
when I... I went on Facebook,</i>

30:37.117 --> 30:39.117
<i>all of this stuff auto-filled.</i>

30:39.119 --> 30:42.555
<i>Norah C. IV, oh!</i>

30:43.591 --> 30:45.324
<i>Pretentious twat.</i>

30:45.326 --> 30:47.293
<i>Only an elitist asshat
would have that kind of name.</i>

30:47.295 --> 30:49.495
<i>Oh, yeah, okay,
Alistair Jeffcock.</i>

30:49.497 --> 30:53.466
<i>Hey, Jeffcock
is a family name, Lexx.</i>

30:53.468 --> 30:54.701
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

30:54.703 --> 30:56.235
<i>It's a fake name.</i>

30:56.237 --> 31:00.574
<i>Guys, it's "Charon" backwards.</i>

31:00.576 --> 31:03.243
<i>Charon IV, Charon IV, yeah.</i>

31:03.245 --> 31:05.245
<i>He's one of them.
He's one of them,</i>

31:05.247 --> 31:07.080
<i>and whoever they are,
they must...</i>

31:07.082 --> 31:10.585
<i>This is where they meet up
to trade.</i>

31:10.587 --> 31:13.220
<i>Trade what?</i>

31:13.222 --> 31:15.121
<i>Well, one of them
was actually sending me</i>

31:15.123 --> 31:16.189
<i>private messages earlier.</i>

31:16.191 --> 31:19.260
<i>It was, uh, Charon68.</i>

31:19.262 --> 31:21.596
<i>Oh, the poor schmuck
never made it to 69.</i>

31:21.598 --> 31:23.598
<i>Yeah, here.</i>

31:23.600 --> 31:27.101
<i>"Just processed the transfer.
You'll have it soon."</i>

31:27.103 --> 31:30.404
<i>It's like he's placing an order for
something he already paid for.</i>

31:30.406 --> 31:32.508
<i>Matias, go back
to the beginning.</i>

31:32.510 --> 31:34.275
<i>Well, the computer
was acting strangely,</i>

31:34.277 --> 31:35.811
<i>so I ran a Disk Utility
and it said</i>

31:35.813 --> 31:38.413
<i>the drive was full, so...</i>

31:38.415 --> 31:40.382
<i>I was lookin' around
and I found this, uh,</i>

31:40.384 --> 31:42.317
<i>this folder, right?
It was...</i>

31:42.319 --> 31:45.320
<i>hidden, invisible,
and it's got videos.</i>

31:45.322 --> 31:47.626
<i>- Nine hundred and sixty gig...
- Show us.</i>

31:51.161 --> 31:53.530
<i>No, wait, wait, wait.
Look at those addresses.</i>

31:53.532 --> 31:54.797
<i>That's here, that's...</i>

31:54.799 --> 31:57.600
<i>the ones on the east side,
and...</i>

32:02.440 --> 32:05.441
<i>I think it's okay.</i>

32:05.443 --> 32:07.243
<i>- He's been wardriving.
- Totally.</i>

32:07.245 --> 32:08.812
<i>- Translate, guys.
- Um, okay, hackers drive</i>

32:08.814 --> 32:10.481
<i>through neighborhoods,
trying to scoop out</i>

32:10.483 --> 32:12.248
<i>Wi-Fi addresses
of any unsecured</i>

32:12.250 --> 32:14.818
<i>or vulnerable routers
so they can...</i>

32:14.820 --> 32:16.587
<i>Hackers can activate
the camera on laptops</i>

32:16.589 --> 32:18.455
<i>and phones and disable
the indicator lights</i>

32:18.457 --> 32:20.224
<i>so you wouldn't even know
that they were on.</i>

32:20.226 --> 32:22.192
<i>- Oh!
- Even the director of the FBI</i>

32:22.194 --> 32:24.194
<i>- says he keeps his covered.
- Yeah, so think about that</i>

32:24.196 --> 32:26.230
<i>next time you're servicing
your porn addiction, AJ.</i>

32:26.232 --> 32:28.733
<i>- So this guy's good.
- Yeah, this takes mad skills.</i>

32:28.735 --> 32:31.103
<i>He might be a goddamn maestro.</i>

32:33.874 --> 32:36.441
<i>Oh, more like a goddamn psycho.</i>

32:36.443 --> 32:38.610
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, did you open that link</i>

32:38.612 --> 32:40.614
<i>in the folder,
the one called "Account?"</i>

32:55.163 --> 32:57.697
<i>Wait, that... that's just
from a couple of minutes ago.</i>

32:57.699 --> 33:00.499
<i>Bitcoin, that's not
a real currency, right?</i>

33:00.501 --> 33:03.904
<i>It's cryptocurrency.
No middleman, no banks.</i>

33:03.906 --> 33:05.507
<i>It's 10 million.</i>

33:08.410 --> 33:11.345
<i>That's $10 million, guys.</i>

33:11.347 --> 33:13.380
<i>Whoa, wait,
this is a joke, right?</i>

33:13.382 --> 33:16.918
<i>Um, dude, are you... Are you
being serious right now or...</i>

33:16.920 --> 33:21.521
<i>All right, the exchange rate
right now is 663.02</i>

33:21.523 --> 33:22.824
<i>per XPT</i>

33:22.826 --> 33:29.297
<i>- times 16,263.52.
- Yep.</i>

33:29.299 --> 33:30.598
<i>- Yep.
- Ten million change.</i>

33:30.600 --> 33:34.869
<i>Yep, 10 million.</i>

33:34.871 --> 33:36.939
<i>- Do you see that?
- It's almost 11.</i>

33:36.941 --> 33:38.673
<i>Free money
just sitting there.</i>

33:38.675 --> 33:41.677
<i>No, no, there's no such thing
as free money, AJ.</i>

33:41.679 --> 33:42.799
<i>I hate to burst your bubble.</i>

33:52.323 --> 33:54.690
<i>He's talking about the money.</i>

33:54.692 --> 33:55.726
<i>Then say something.</i>

34:01.900 --> 34:03.535
<i>Wait, wait, don't...</i>

34:13.712 --> 34:15.681
<i>Type, uh, "For what?"</i>

34:27.627 --> 34:29.659
<i>Hello, hair.
He's talking about hair.</i>

34:29.661 --> 34:32.632
<i>AJ, for once in your life,
just put a cork in it.</i>

34:40.273 --> 34:42.676
<i>Method... what's he...</i>

34:52.920 --> 34:54.388
<i>What is that?</i>

35:01.629 --> 35:05.698
<i>"A surgical procedure
in which a hole is...</i>

35:05.700 --> 35:09.002
<i>drilled into the skull."</i>

35:09.004 --> 35:10.739
<i>Oh, my God, this is...</i>

35:16.912 --> 35:19.079
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

35:19.081 --> 35:21.782
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

35:21.784 --> 35:24.918
<i>Oh!</i>

35:24.920 --> 35:26.587
<i>No, no, no, no, Matias!</i>

35:26.589 --> 35:28.522
<i>- Matias!
- Just shut it off!</i>

35:28.524 --> 35:30.357
<i>Matias, shut it off!</i>

35:30.359 --> 35:31.599
<i>All right, all right,
all right!</i>

35:42.939 --> 35:44.407
<i>That's him, isn't it?</i>

35:49.679 --> 35:51.314
<i>Don't answer.</i>

35:53.450 --> 35:55.584
<i>Contributions?</i>

35:55.586 --> 35:57.419
<i>Charon 68,
the first thing he wrote</i>

35:57.421 --> 36:00.122
<i>was that he liked
the last contribution.</i>

36:00.124 --> 36:01.690
<i>Um, go back to the video folder</i>

36:01.692 --> 36:04.094
<i>and scroll all the way
to the bottom.</i>

36:04.096 --> 36:07.663
<i>Just go all the way down.</i>

36:07.665 --> 36:10.100
<i>No, Matias,
don't open it, please.</i>

36:10.102 --> 36:11.770
<i>- Just...
- No, just open.</i>

36:14.740 --> 36:16.608
<i>No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, I don't...</i>

37:18.940 --> 37:20.508
<i>Oh, God.</i>

37:25.181 --> 37:26.881
<i>Uh, no, no, no, no, okay.</i>

37:26.883 --> 37:28.749
<i>- No, I can't... I can't...
- Oh, God.</i>

37:28.751 --> 37:30.217
<i>Out of this one,
out of this one.</i>

37:30.219 --> 37:31.821
<i>I can't watch that.</i>

37:58.249 --> 38:00.849
<i>Okay, these are
custom videos, these are...</i>

38:00.851 --> 38:02.852
<i>Guys, that's what
they're trading.</i>

38:02.854 --> 38:04.954
<i>AJ, I don't...
I don't... I don't...</i>

38:04.956 --> 38:08.693
<i>No, no, this is... Okay.</i>

38:11.696 --> 38:13.195
<i>Show me the most recent one.</i>

38:13.197 --> 38:14.565
<i>Nari.</i>

38:16.868 --> 38:18.601
<i>The last one,
it's a small file.</i>

38:18.603 --> 38:19.970
<i>It's smaller
than the other ones.</i>

38:19.972 --> 38:22.172
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

38:22.174 --> 38:25.676
<i>Just open it.</i>

38:25.678 --> 38:26.912
<i>Okay.</i>

38:39.658 --> 38:40.860
<i>Wait, wait, stop.</i>

38:42.996 --> 38:44.764
<i>This can't be real.</i>

38:55.709 --> 38:58.177
<i>Matias, go to the end.</i>

38:58.179 --> 38:59.646
<i>Go all the way to the end.</i>

39:07.288 --> 39:09.890
<i>Why is he looking
at the camera?</i>

39:14.929 --> 39:16.795
<i>- That was it, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

39:16.797 --> 39:18.697
<i>Well, then he might not
have her yet.</i>

39:18.699 --> 39:20.000
<i>She's still in her bedroom,</i>

39:20.002 --> 39:21.968
<i>all the other girls weren't.</i>

39:21.970 --> 39:23.937
<i>Look, he chooses a girl,</i>

39:23.939 --> 39:25.572
<i>shows her to the rest
of the group,</i>

39:25.574 --> 39:27.874
<i>and waits for someone to pay.</i>

39:27.876 --> 39:29.709
<i>And someone just paid,
so this is...</i>

39:29.711 --> 39:31.745
<i>- this is the next girl.
- We have to report this, Nari.</i>

39:31.747 --> 39:33.646
<i>Oh, we have her address
so just we can do</i>

39:33.648 --> 39:35.648
<i>- a reverse phone look-up?
- Guys, I'll be right back,</i>

39:35.650 --> 39:37.051
<i>- I'll be right back.
- Matias!</i>

39:38.721 --> 39:40.187
<i>Matias, I'm not...</i>

39:40.189 --> 39:41.789
<i>Look, please, I'm not...
No,</i>

39:41.791 --> 39:43.593
<i>please just give me
one second.</i>

39:51.068 --> 39:52.300
<i>Hello, hello!</i>

39:53.904 --> 39:55.005
<i>Hello!</i>

40:00.277 --> 40:02.077
<i>Kelly?</i>

40:02.079 --> 40:03.345
<i>Kelly!</i>

40:03.347 --> 40:04.748
<i>Kelly!</i>

40:07.684 --> 40:11.120
<i>Hey! Hey, hold on, one second.</i>

40:11.122 --> 40:13.022
<i>Hello?</i>

40:13.024 --> 40:15.825
<i>Uh, yeah, we did.</i>

40:15.827 --> 40:17.693
<i>Okay. Well,</i>

40:17.695 --> 40:20.663
<i>he must have figured it out
'cause we got him.</i>

40:20.665 --> 40:22.365
<i>Yeah, sure thing.</i>

40:22.367 --> 40:25.335
<i>Thanks.</i>

40:25.337 --> 40:27.036
<i>Sorry, that was
the pizza place.</i>

40:27.038 --> 40:28.938
<i>I guess the driver called,
couldn't figure out</i>

40:28.940 --> 40:32.910
<i>where we were or something,
I don't know. Hi!</i>

40:32.912 --> 40:35.245
<i>- Is, um, is Amaya with you right now?
- No.</i>

40:35.247 --> 40:36.814
<i>I mean, I just got in,</i>

40:36.816 --> 40:39.316
<i>and I think Amaya's
in the shower.</i>

40:39.318 --> 40:41.218
<i>Well, can you possibly get her
for me right now?</i>

40:41.220 --> 40:42.886
<i>- Oh, wow! What?
- Uh...</i>

40:42.888 --> 40:44.721
<i>- Okay, are you there?
- Hello, hello?</i>

40:44.723 --> 40:45.989
<i>I can hear you.
Are you still there?</i>

40:45.991 --> 40:47.958
<i>- I just can't...
- Kelly, I can't see you.</i>

40:47.960 --> 40:49.726
<i>- I can't see you.
- Uh, where'd you go?</i>

40:49.728 --> 40:51.029
<i>- Hold on a second.
- Yeah, is that</i>

40:51.031 --> 40:53.031
<i>- on your end or...
- No, I think it's my end.</i>

40:53.033 --> 40:55.834
<i>Yeah, sorry, hold on.</i>

40:55.836 --> 40:58.336
<i>God! God! Kelly!</i>

40:58.338 --> 40:59.938
<i>Kelly!</i>

40:59.940 --> 41:00.941
<i>Kelly!</i>

41:05.879 --> 41:06.879
<i>Kelly!</i>

41:48.858 --> 41:50.059
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

42:09.213 --> 42:10.412
<i>Amaya, Amaya, Amaya,</i>

42:10.414 --> 42:12.781
<i>Amaya, Amaya, Amaya!</i>

42:12.783 --> 42:14.752
<i>Hey! Come here, come here!</i>

42:20.192 --> 42:22.225
<i>Can you see...</i>

42:22.227 --> 42:25.228
<i>Amaya, Amaya, Amaya!</i>

42:25.230 --> 42:26.963
<i>Don't go in there,
don't go in there,</i>

42:26.965 --> 42:29.832
<i>don't go in there,
don't go... don't...</i>

42:29.834 --> 42:31.501
<i>stop, stop, stop!</i>

42:31.503 --> 42:33.436
<i>Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.</i>

42:33.438 --> 42:34.971
<i>Come here, come here,
come here.</i>

42:34.973 --> 42:37.173
<i>Come here, come here.
Good, good.</i>

42:37.175 --> 42:40.244
<i>Shit. I... it must...
it must be a bug,</i>

42:40.246 --> 42:42.546
<i>or something.
Your computer called mine.</i>

42:42.548 --> 42:46.317
<i>Um, uh, Kelly, Kelly's, um,</i>

42:46.319 --> 42:50.521
<i>She's... she brought a...
she brought a guy home.</i>

42:50.523 --> 42:53.257
<i>He's... she's... don't, don't,</i>

42:53.259 --> 42:54.992
<i>don't disconnect.</i>

42:54.994 --> 42:57.029
<i>I'll wait for you.
I'll wait... I'll wait for you.</i>

43:09.076 --> 43:10.141
<i>Hey!</i>

43:10.143 --> 43:11.144
<i>Hey!</i>

43:27.328 --> 43:30.296
<i>Can you please sit down?</i>

43:47.216 --> 43:49.049
<i>Please, please, just please
don't hurt her.</i>

43:49.051 --> 43:50.418
<i>I'll do anything
you want me to do,</i>

43:50.420 --> 43:52.286
<i>I will do anything, I promise.</i>

43:59.929 --> 44:01.364
<i>How are you doing that?</i>

44:18.516 --> 44:21.852
<i>How can I give... I can't give
you the laptop if I can't...</i>

44:33.064 --> 44:36.566
<i>Wait just one second,
could you wait?</i>

44:36.568 --> 44:38.403
God.

44:44.509 --> 44:47.112
<i>Okay. Be calm. Just be...</i>

45:12.071 --> 45:13.971
<i>Matias, Matias, Matias,
Matias, okay.</i>

45:13.973 --> 45:15.674
<i>Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
no, I'm here, I'm here,</i>

45:15.676 --> 45:18.143
<i>- I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.
- Listen, here's the plan, okay?</i>

45:18.145 --> 45:20.312
<i>Nari is going to meet you down
at the police station,</i>

45:20.314 --> 45:22.280
<i>there's one that's half
a mile away from your place.</i>

45:22.282 --> 45:24.416
<i>You need to bring the laptop
with you, because every...</i>

45:24.418 --> 45:26.619
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait,
where's Damon? Where's Damon?</i>

45:26.621 --> 45:28.221
<i>No, no, no, no, we need...
we need Damon.</i>

45:28.223 --> 45:30.156
<i>- Damon! Damon! We need Damon!
- What? Matias!</i>

45:30.158 --> 45:32.525
<i>- We need Damon right now! Damon!
- I'm sorry!</i>

45:32.527 --> 45:34.694
<i>- Have we called the police or what?
- No, we're not calling police.</i>

45:34.696 --> 45:36.362
<i>We're going to the police,
okay? Matias...</i>

45:36.364 --> 45:38.531
<i>We don't have a lot of time, okay?
We need to help this girl.</i>

45:38.533 --> 45:40.032
<i>- Matias!
- Yeah.</i>

45:40.034 --> 45:42.569
<i>- I know there's a lot going on, okay?
- Uh-hmm.</i>

45:42.571 --> 45:47.674
<i>But you need to trust us,
and you need to move fast.</i>

45:47.676 --> 45:50.677
<i>Get the laptop,
go down to the police station.</i>

45:50.679 --> 45:52.146
<i>- I will be there, okay?
- No.</i>

45:52.148 --> 45:54.348
<i>- I have a friend that will meet us.
- We can't.</i>

45:54.350 --> 45:56.250
<i>He knows how to deal
with this kind of situation!</i>

45:56.252 --> 45:58.452
<i>- Yes! Yes, yes, yes, you can.
- No, we can't... we can't...</i>

45:58.454 --> 46:01.321
<i>It's not... it's not real.</i>

46:01.323 --> 46:03.023
<i>What?</i>

46:03.025 --> 46:04.461
<i>It's, um...</i>

46:06.162 --> 46:07.695
<i>It's a... it's a game.</i>

46:07.697 --> 46:09.029
<i>I made the whole thing up.</i>

46:09.031 --> 46:10.200
<i>It's a game.</i>

46:12.769 --> 46:17.107
<i>Lexx, you were... You were totally
onto me from the beginning.</i>

46:19.443 --> 46:21.544
<i>Wait, I'm confused.</i>

46:21.546 --> 46:23.011
<i>What?</i>

46:23.013 --> 46:24.713
<i>Yeah, it's, um, it's a game.</i>

46:24.715 --> 46:27.450
<i>It's my game. It's the one
I've been working on.</i>

46:27.452 --> 46:29.020
<i>Damon, Damon knows.</i>

46:31.155 --> 46:33.456
<i>I'm sorry, I'm lost.
I what now?</i>

46:33.458 --> 46:36.525
<i>I told you I was... I told you
I was writing something.</i>

46:36.527 --> 46:39.228
<i>- Matias, I'm...
- Uh, yeah, man, you said</i>

46:39.230 --> 46:41.263
<i>you're writing something,
you didn't say playtesting</i>

46:41.265 --> 46:45.100
<i>- or implementing.
- Well, yeah, I wanted to be...</i>

46:45.102 --> 46:47.437
<i>I wanted to get an actual
response out of you, you know.</i>

46:47.439 --> 46:50.106
<i>I mean, if you... If you knew what was
coming, then it wouldn't feel real.</i>

46:50.108 --> 46:54.377
<i>That way I could, you know, I could
tell if it actually could work.</i>

46:54.379 --> 46:57.080
<i>It is game night.</i>

46:57.082 --> 47:00.384
<i>- Holy shit, man!
- Asshole.</i>

47:00.386 --> 47:03.053
<i>- Oh, my God!
- I guess that means it was pretty good, huh?</i>

47:03.055 --> 47:05.323
<i>Matias, this is not funny.</i>

47:05.325 --> 47:07.692
<i>It's... actually, it's not,
it's not supposed to be funny.</i>

47:07.694 --> 47:10.328
<i>- It's actually, uh, it's a horror transmedia.
- Oh, holy shit... It's an ARG.</i>

47:10.330 --> 47:12.798
<i>- It's an alternate reality game.
- Exactly, yeah.</i>

47:12.800 --> 47:17.201
<i>It's a... it's a test of what you would
do if the experience actually happened.</i>

47:17.203 --> 47:19.136
<i>- Wow!
- Wow. That was bloody...</i>

47:19.138 --> 47:21.105
<i>- Wait, AJ, were you in on this?
- Hell no!</i>

47:21.107 --> 47:22.741
<i>I had no...
I had no idea about this.</i>

47:22.743 --> 47:25.410
<i>Where... dude, where'd you...
Where'd you get those videos?</i>

47:25.412 --> 47:28.213
<i>- That is some dark shit.
- Yeah.</i>

47:28.215 --> 47:31.316
<i>Yeah, I know, I know,
it's just horror films.</i>

47:31.318 --> 47:34.486
<i>What... hah! Okay, well,
you must have dug into some</i>

47:34.488 --> 47:37.490
<i>really obscure shit,
because I have seen everything</i>

47:37.492 --> 47:40.260
<i>and I haven't seen any
of those videos that you...</i>

47:40.262 --> 47:44.163
<i>What if we'd called
the police?</i>

47:44.165 --> 47:47.166
<i>Well, ideally you would...
you would register to play</i>

47:47.168 --> 47:50.270
<i>with your cell number,
so if, you know,</i>

47:50.272 --> 47:52.472
<i>by the time you logged in,
if you called 911,</i>

47:52.474 --> 47:54.542
<i>it would hack your phone
and you would get a recording</i>

47:54.544 --> 47:57.243
<i>like the bad guy hacked
into the phone.</i>

47:57.245 --> 47:58.712
<i>Wow!</i>

47:58.714 --> 48:01.348
<i>That, you know, it's crazy.</i>

48:01.350 --> 48:03.319
<i>- Phew!
- Wait, the...</i>

48:23.607 --> 48:27.110
<i>I went to that ASL class,</i>

48:28.512 --> 48:30.746
<i>or the... or the...
or the first one,</i>

48:30.748 --> 48:32.782
<i>the first one, at least.</i>

48:32.784 --> 48:34.417
<i>And then... and the guy,</i>

48:34.419 --> 48:36.619
<i>he was... he was...
he was teaching the class,</i>

48:36.621 --> 48:38.354
<i>he was talking about</i>

48:38.356 --> 48:42.224
<i>how hard it was
for a hearing-impaired person</i>

48:42.226 --> 48:44.895
<i>to have a meaningful
relationship with someone</i>

48:44.897 --> 48:46.562
<i>who couldn't sign.</i>

48:46.564 --> 48:50.166
<i>And then... and how it builds
this special bond,</i>

48:50.168 --> 48:53.269
<i>the ability to communicate
with someone</i>

48:53.271 --> 48:54.751
<i>in a... in a special way
that would...</i>

49:00.512 --> 49:01.647
<i>And you're right.</i>

49:06.853 --> 49:09.154
<i>I'm really fucking scared,
Amaya.</i>

49:10.857 --> 49:12.890
<i>I mean, I've never cared</i>

49:12.892 --> 49:15.927
<i>about anyone or anything</i>

49:15.929 --> 49:17.430
<i>the way I care about you.</i>

49:20.900 --> 49:22.634
<i>The night we met at the bar,</i>

49:22.636 --> 49:24.235
<i>I...</i>

49:24.237 --> 49:27.240
<i>the music was so loud, and...</i>

49:28.609 --> 49:31.712
<i>I saw you
and I remember thinking...</i>

49:32.847 --> 49:34.813
<i>Oh, why bother?</i>

49:34.815 --> 49:37.216
<i>That a beautiful person</i>

49:37.218 --> 49:38.784
<i>wouldn't be able
to hear you anyway,</i>

49:38.786 --> 49:40.388
<i>it's so loud.</i>

49:42.423 --> 49:45.892
<i>I didn't know you were deaf.</i>

49:45.894 --> 49:47.661
<i>I didn't know</i>

49:47.663 --> 49:50.399
<i>that all that noise
wouldn't matter.</i>

49:53.335 --> 49:56.903
<i>I mean,
that's what I want for us.</i>

49:56.905 --> 50:00.908
<i>I want nothing else to matter.</i>

50:00.910 --> 50:03.678
<i>I want nothing
to be in the way</i>

50:03.680 --> 50:05.615
<i>of how much I love you.</i>

50:15.258 --> 50:17.758
<i>I need you
to come here, okay?</i>

50:17.760 --> 50:21.197
<i>I need you to get here
as fast as you can, okay?</i>

50:22.032 --> 50:24.601
<i>Take the subway, okay?</i>

50:37.381 --> 50:40.649
<i>Matias, what was
with them Roman numerals?</i>

50:40.651 --> 50:42.952
<i>- Like, why the Roman numerals?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

50:42.954 --> 50:44.554
<i>- What do you mean?
- That's weird.</i>

50:44.556 --> 50:46.656
<i>Well, in the game,
instead of Charon's</i>

50:46.658 --> 50:48.925
<i>just like being like a,
you know, Charon 4,</i>

50:48.927 --> 50:50.660
<i>like the number four,
it had an IV.</i>

50:50.662 --> 50:53.296
<i>And what about the girl
in the video,</i>

50:53.298 --> 50:54.831
<i>the one who was next?</i>

50:54.833 --> 50:55.999
<i>What about her?</i>

50:57.036 --> 50:58.668
<i>Where'd you get the video?</i>

50:58.670 --> 51:00.603
<i>Sorry, guys.
I got to take this.</i>

51:00.605 --> 51:02.539
<i>It's the... it's the
Puppet Masters.</i>

51:02.541 --> 51:05.008
<i>- No problem.
- Mute your mic, Lexx.</i>

51:05.010 --> 51:06.777
<i>- Yeah.
- Mama!</i>

51:07.947 --> 51:09.680
<i>Lexx, mute your mic!</i>

51:09.682 --> 51:12.050
<i>- Oh, my God.
- She does this every time.</i>

51:12.052 --> 51:13.650
<i>Yeah, you are louder than her.</i>

51:13.652 --> 51:16.487
<i>Oh, my God. Mama.</i>

51:16.489 --> 51:18.455
<i>I love how loud she is
on the phone to her mother.</i>

51:18.457 --> 51:20.759
<i>It's just like,
straight up, like, bam.</i>

51:20.761 --> 51:21.793
<i>I know.</i>

51:27.100 --> 51:29.634
<i>You guys,
we do not have to play a game.</i>

51:29.636 --> 51:31.603
<i>Let's just chat.
Let's just hang out,</i>

51:31.605 --> 51:35.074
<i>and, um, you know,
what if... you guys,</i>

51:35.076 --> 51:36.909
<i>maybe we should do
a guided meditation together.</i>

51:36.911 --> 51:38.144
<i>Um, no.</i>

51:38.146 --> 51:40.579
<i>I really did think
that was real for a second.</i>

51:40.581 --> 51:44.083
<i>I'm gonna be honest.
I was totally there.</i>

51:44.085 --> 51:46.786
<i>That was the most fun I've had,
in, like, two years.</i>

51:46.788 --> 51:49.590
<i>Ugh. Good one.</i>

52:35.072 --> 52:36.138
<i>Matias, Matias.</i>

52:36.140 --> 52:37.739
<i>I have more questions, man.</i>

52:37.741 --> 52:39.575
<i>Yeah, here,
I'm sorry. What's up?</i>

52:39.577 --> 52:42.010
<i>Is it better, like,
that we did it as a team,</i>

52:42.012 --> 52:44.180
<i>or as a solo experience?</i>

52:44.182 --> 52:45.747
<i>And also...
and like how the hell</i>

52:45.749 --> 52:47.482
<i>are you handling
the decision tree?</i>

52:47.484 --> 52:48.684
<i>Like, say, if we had decided</i>

52:48.686 --> 52:50.652
<i>to do something
with the bad guy's money,</i>

52:50.654 --> 52:52.922
<i>if we'd taken it,
then how does that ripple</i>

52:52.924 --> 52:55.424
<i>through the rest of the story?</i>

52:57.495 --> 52:58.728
<i>Hello? Matia...</i>

52:58.730 --> 53:01.030
<i>Oh, bloody hell,
he's away with the fairies.</i>

53:01.032 --> 53:02.665
<i>- Matias!
- Hold on, I'll be...</i>

53:02.667 --> 53:04.500
<i>I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.</i>

53:04.502 --> 53:06.203
<i>How long are you
gonna be gone this time?</i>

53:26.126 --> 53:29.027
<i>Are you there?</i>

53:29.029 --> 53:31.629
<i>Are you there?
Can you hear me...</i>

53:31.631 --> 53:32.933
<i>Hear me?</i>

53:39.106 --> 53:41.473
<i>Good.</i>

53:41.475 --> 53:43.443
<i>Then watch this.</i>

54:15.077 --> 54:17.144
<i>You get the computer back</i>

54:17.146 --> 54:19.546
<i>when I get Amaya back.</i>

54:19.548 --> 54:21.548
<i>You get the money back
when I see on the news</i>

54:21.550 --> 54:25.219
<i>that Erica Dunne is back home
safe with her parents.</i>

54:30.660 --> 54:32.293
<i>You stupid motherfucker.</i>

54:32.295 --> 54:35.063
<i>- All I want is my laptop.
- All I want is Amaya.</i>

54:35.065 --> 54:36.597
<i>You don't understand</i>

54:36.599 --> 54:37.865
<i>what you have gotten
yourself into.</i>

54:37.867 --> 54:40.302
<i>- You killed Kelly!
- No, I didn't.</i>

54:40.304 --> 54:42.804
<i>If you lay a hand
on Amaya or Erica,</i>

54:42.806 --> 54:44.306
<i>you'll never see
any of that money.</i>

54:44.308 --> 54:46.141
<i>Shut the fuck up and listen.</i>

54:46.143 --> 54:49.011
<i>- They do not let girls go.
- What are you talking about?</i>

54:49.013 --> 54:51.680
<i>The Circle,
the people I work with,</i>

54:51.682 --> 54:53.716
<i>all the other Charon clients,</i>

54:53.718 --> 54:55.751
<i>they monitor
all Bitcoin accounts.</i>

54:55.753 --> 54:57.753
<i>They're gonna think
I'm trying to cash out.</i>

55:03.095 --> 55:05.295
<i>Hello?</i>

55:05.297 --> 55:06.932
<i>Hello, hello!</i>

55:11.636 --> 55:13.269
<i>I lost your screen.
What's going on?</i>

55:13.271 --> 55:15.839
<i>- What's happening?
- I don't... I don't know.</i>

55:15.841 --> 55:19.043
<i>Oh, God, they pulled you
across the river, didn't they?</i>

55:19.045 --> 55:21.178
<i>Hey, you know what?
I'm just... I'm gonna close it.</i>

55:21.180 --> 55:22.780
<i>No!
Do not close it.</i>

55:22.782 --> 55:25.018
<i>They're gonna know
you're not me.</i>

55:29.122 --> 55:30.654
<i>Are they talking to you?</i>

55:30.656 --> 55:32.658
<i>What are they saying?</i>

55:34.927 --> 55:38.063
<i>They're saying...
they're saying recite the code.</i>

55:38.065 --> 55:39.331
<i>Oh, God.</i>

55:39.333 --> 55:41.233
<i>You just put a bullet
in our head.</i>

55:41.235 --> 55:43.971
<i>You stupid... Okay.</i>

55:45.639 --> 55:47.107
<i>Listen to me.</i>

55:48.108 --> 55:50.042
<i>If they find out</i>

55:50.044 --> 55:52.278
<i>that I lost that computer, they're
gonna kill me, they're gonna kill you,</i>

55:52.280 --> 55:54.746
<i>and they're gonna kill anyone
else that might have seen it.</i>

55:54.748 --> 55:56.282
<i>Just give me the code then.</i>

55:56.284 --> 55:57.383
<i>Give me the money
back first and then...</i>

55:57.385 --> 55:58.717
<i>No. Fuck you!</i>

55:58.719 --> 55:59.785
<i>I am 10 feet away from Amaya,</i>

55:59.787 --> 56:01.754
<i>and I will put a knife
in her throat</i>

56:01.756 --> 56:03.623
<i>and disappear before
she even hits the ground.</i>

56:03.625 --> 56:05.625
<i>I think you're a dead man
who lost $10 million.</i>

56:05.627 --> 56:06.726
<i>This can be so easy.</i>

56:06.728 --> 56:08.395
<i>I return Amaya,
you return the laptop,</i>

56:08.397 --> 56:10.096
<i>and it'll be like nothing
ever happened.</i>

56:10.098 --> 56:11.231
<i>No, you killed Kelly!</i>

56:11.233 --> 56:13.099
<i>No, I didn't.
I just bashed her head.</i>

56:13.101 --> 56:15.335
<i>She'll wake up and think
it was a robbery or something.</i>

56:15.337 --> 56:17.037
<i>We have no time for this.</i>

56:17.039 --> 56:18.238
<i>Return the money.</i>

56:18.240 --> 56:19.807
<i>No, no, no. No, no, no. No.</i>

56:19.809 --> 56:21.742
<i>When Erica Dunne is home safe,</i>

56:21.744 --> 56:23.310
<i>then you get the money.</i>

56:23.312 --> 56:25.179
<i>Okay.</i>

56:25.181 --> 56:27.114
<i>You better hurry up.</i>

56:27.116 --> 56:30.820
<i>They said this is
your last chance, Charon IV.</i>

56:32.688 --> 56:34.189
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

56:34.191 --> 56:37.292
<i>Type A-B-Y-S-S-U-S.</i>

56:37.294 --> 56:40.829
<i>Second word:
A-B-Y-S-S-U-M.</i>

56:40.831 --> 56:44.699
<i>Third word:
I-N-V-O-C-A-T.</i>

56:44.701 --> 56:46.034
<i>Oh, wait, they're typing
in all caps.</i>

56:46.036 --> 56:48.437
<i>- Should it be in all caps?
- Just fucking send it.</i>

56:48.439 --> 56:50.107
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

56:51.741 --> 56:53.675
<i>They're asking
why you drained the account.</i>

56:53.677 --> 56:55.947
<i>Tell them I switched
from Bitcoin to Ethereum.</i>

57:01.052 --> 57:02.351
<i>They're asking why.</i>

57:02.353 --> 57:04.120
<i>It's a better exchange rate.</i>

57:04.122 --> 57:05.189
<i>I got a tip.</i>

57:12.131 --> 57:13.698
<i>Are they buying it?</i>

57:18.337 --> 57:20.205
<i>Yeah, think so.</i>

57:23.775 --> 57:25.275
<i>We'll be there soon,
you'll get Amaya.</i>

57:25.277 --> 57:27.146
<i>And you'll get your laptop.</i>

57:30.383 --> 57:32.883
<i>If I let Erica go,</i>

57:32.885 --> 57:35.153
<i>they're gonna think
that she escaped and...</i>

57:35.155 --> 57:37.421
<i>they're gonna lose faith,
they're gonna hold me liable.</i>

57:37.423 --> 57:38.590
<i>Yeah, but you'll have
$10 million</i>

57:38.592 --> 57:42.461
<i>to help you figure out
how to disappear.</i>

57:42.463 --> 57:45.264
<i>If anything goes wrong
between here and there,</i>

57:45.266 --> 57:47.168
<i>you're both dead.</i>

57:52.506 --> 57:53.839
<i>He's lying to us.</i>

57:53.841 --> 57:56.375
<i>He's back. Matias.</i>

57:56.377 --> 57:59.444
<i>Yo. What?</i>

57:59.446 --> 58:03.949
<i>- Okay, Nari, it is just a game.
- I found her. Okay?</i>

58:03.951 --> 58:06.818
<i>- I found the girl, Matias, from your video.
- Found who?</i>

58:06.820 --> 58:08.221
<i>She's real.
Her name's Erica Dunne.</i>

58:08.223 --> 58:10.256
<i>She is real,
and she's really missing.</i>

58:10.258 --> 58:12.492
<i>No, Nari, I know, I know.
I just... That was a...</i>

58:12.494 --> 58:14.961
<i>Is it... Is it just
a placeholder or like...</i>

58:14.963 --> 58:16.863
<i>Yeah. No, it is, it is,
it's a placeholder.</i>

58:16.865 --> 58:18.532
<i>Dude, that's messed up, man.</i>

58:18.534 --> 58:21.968
<i>Where did you even
get the video?</i>

58:21.970 --> 58:22.735
<i>LiveLeak.</i>

58:22.737 --> 58:23.803
<i>Yeah, someone on the inside</i>

58:23.805 --> 58:25.805
<i>just must have...
must have leaked it</i>

58:25.807 --> 58:26.873
<i>or something. I don't know.</i>

58:26.875 --> 58:29.011
<i>Why would you use that video?</i>

58:31.547 --> 58:33.247
<i>Okay, you know what?
Send the link.</i>

58:33.249 --> 58:34.915
<i>Nari, that's ridiculous.</i>

58:34.917 --> 58:36.450
<i>What?</i>

58:36.452 --> 58:38.486
<i>Who's that?</i>

58:38.488 --> 58:41.323
<i>Is that... Is that Amaya?</i>

58:41.325 --> 58:43.092
<i>Turn on your video, love.</i>

58:45.529 --> 58:48.330
<i>- Matias?
- No, no, no. Get him off.</i>

58:48.332 --> 58:50.832
<i>- Matias, is that you?
- How do we get this person off?</i>

58:50.834 --> 58:52.554
<i>Does anyone know
how we get this person off?</i>

58:54.171 --> 58:56.238
<i>- Stop it.
- Wait, what's going on?</i>

58:56.240 --> 58:57.973
<i>Come on, Matias.</i>

58:57.975 --> 58:59.508
<i>Are you... you sneaky
little bastard.</i>

58:59.510 --> 59:01.142
<i>He's playing us.
It's still the game.</i>

59:01.144 --> 59:03.179
<i>No. No, guys, do... hey,
listen, do not click the link.</i>

59:03.181 --> 59:05.448
<i>- Is this the link?
- Do not click the link.</i>

59:05.450 --> 59:07.984
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

59:07.986 --> 59:09.552
<i>Guys,
we didn't click the link,</i>

59:09.554 --> 59:11.254
<i>but the video's playing anyway.</i>

59:11.256 --> 59:12.790
<i>Same here.</i>

59:14.158 --> 59:16.025
<i>- What the...
- What is it?</i>

59:16.027 --> 59:17.927
<i>That was senior year.
That's December.</i>

59:17.929 --> 59:20.297
<i>That's actually
McLeary's Pub, yeah?</i>

59:26.005 --> 59:28.005
<i>- This is so cool.
- What does this have</i>

59:28.007 --> 59:29.973
<i>- to do with the...
- I don't know.</i>

59:29.975 --> 59:33.310
<i>Wait, guys,
where is Lexx?</i>

59:33.312 --> 59:36.179
<i>She's probably still getting
a bollocking from her mom.</i>

59:36.181 --> 59:37.216
<i>Lexx!</i>

59:42.589 --> 59:44.188
<i>- What is that?
- That's Drill Bit.</i>

59:44.190 --> 59:46.024
<i>- That's an exploit.
- What is an exploit?</i>

59:46.026 --> 59:47.894
<i>It's a hacking tool.</i>

59:51.064 --> 59:52.130
<i>Lexx!</i>

59:52.132 --> 59:53.231
<i>Weird.</i>

59:53.233 --> 59:55.066
<i>Are you calling Lexx
right now?</i>

59:55.068 --> 59:56.968
<i>Yes,
I'm calling Lexx right now.</i>

59:56.970 --> 59:58.970
<i>Wait, wait,
I thought she was...</i>

01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:03.642
<i>Where is she?</i>

01:00:03.644 --> 01:00:05.611
<i>Okay, I am lo...</i>

01:00:05.613 --> 01:00:08.349
<i>Is she in on this, Matias?
What's going on?</i>

01:00:10.951 --> 01:00:12.351
<i>Is that the German place?</i>

01:00:28.136 --> 01:00:29.035
<i>No!</i>

01:00:29.037 --> 01:00:30.370
<i>Did she just jump?</i>

01:00:30.372 --> 01:00:32.408
<i>Oh, my God! Help!</i>

01:00:41.351 --> 01:00:43.551
<i>Matias?</i>

01:00:43.553 --> 01:00:45.121
<i>Was that Lexx?</i>

01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:49.457
<i>Jeez.</i>

01:00:49.459 --> 01:00:51.158
<i>Matias, please, talk to us.</i>

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.463
<i>This is just...
This is the game.</i>

01:00:54.465 --> 01:00:56.264
<i>That wasn't her.</i>

01:01:12.249 --> 01:01:15.050
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, how close are you?</i>

01:01:15.052 --> 01:01:17.155
<i>How close... how close
are you to the subway?</i>

01:01:18.423 --> 01:01:20.289
<i>Okay, okay, can you...
Can you do me a favor?</i>

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:22.158
<i>Can you... Can you stay
on the call?</i>

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.160
<i>And just keep your...
keep your phone in your pocket,</i>

01:01:24.162 --> 01:01:27.165
<i>or whatever,
just stay on, okay?</i>

01:01:29.535 --> 01:01:31.335
<i>Just trust me, okay?</i>

01:01:31.337 --> 01:01:33.069
<i>And when you...
and I'll explain it to you</i>

01:01:33.071 --> 01:01:35.972
<i>when you... when you get here,
all right?</i>

01:01:35.974 --> 01:01:37.441
<i>Wait, no.
Nari, Nari, Nari, Nari,</i>

01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:39.243
<i>- who are you calling?
- I'm calling Lexx.</i>

01:01:39.245 --> 01:01:41.178
<i>Don't. Please,
do not call her right now.</i>

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.080
<i>- Okay? Please, just trust...
- Straight to voicemail.</i>

01:01:43.082 --> 01:01:45.282
<i>Okay, guys. Hey, listen to me
for a second, all right?</i>

01:01:45.284 --> 01:01:47.117
<i>No more calls, all right?
We just... you can...</i>

01:01:47.119 --> 01:01:48.318
<i>you can leave your phones on,</i>

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.154
<i>- but just don't...
- Why?</i>

01:01:50.156 --> 01:01:52.290
<i>There are automated calls,
it's part of the game.</i>

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:54.192
<i>I just... I just wanna make sure
that they're going through.</i>

01:01:54.194 --> 01:01:55.727
<i>Bullshit, Matias.
Bullshit, okay?</i>

01:01:55.729 --> 01:01:56.928
<i>- Okay, Nari, Nari.
- I have had enough.</i>

01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:59.063
<i>I swear, if you don't start
talking now...</i>

01:01:59.065 --> 01:02:00.398
<i>Matias is playing with you.</i>

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.367
<i>No. No, no,
I am calling the police.</i>

01:02:02.369 --> 01:02:04.469
<i>Nari, Nari, please.
Do not do that.</i>

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:06.605
<i>- Please, hang, hang up the phone, Nari.
- No, I am not.</i>

01:02:06.607 --> 01:02:08.607
<i>- I am gonna call the police right now.
- Calm down, guys.</i>

01:02:08.609 --> 01:02:11.777
<i>Just give me one more second,
please, just one more second!</i>

01:02:11.779 --> 01:02:14.148
<i>Guys, it's real.
The whole thing is real.</i>

01:02:18.352 --> 01:02:21.120
<i>Just, just listen to me, all right?
The reason I said it was a game</i>

01:02:21.122 --> 01:02:23.757
<i>is because he said if anyone
knew or if anyone disconnected,</i>

01:02:23.759 --> 01:02:26.325
<i>- he would kill Amaya and then he'd come after all of you.
- Who?</i>

01:02:26.327 --> 01:02:29.128
<i>Charon! Charon, Charon IV.
The guy whose laptop I took.</i>

01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:31.331
<i>Okay, Matias. We get it.
I'm kind of done with this now.</i>

01:02:31.333 --> 01:02:33.200
<i>Just... can you shut up
and listen to me, please?</i>

01:02:33.202 --> 01:02:35.769
<i>Please. He can hear
and see everything, all right?</i>

01:02:35.771 --> 01:02:38.071
<i>I mean, he, he found
Amaya's apartment.</i>

01:02:38.073 --> 01:02:40.440
<i>She was the first person I called, so he
must have been able to track her somehow,</i>

01:02:40.442 --> 01:02:43.376
<i>- or, or, or I don't know.
- You're serious? You're being serious right now?</i>

01:02:43.378 --> 01:02:46.112
<i>She's on her way over here,
and he's following her.</i>

01:02:46.114 --> 01:02:48.048
<i>Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
So, so there is no game.</i>

01:02:48.050 --> 01:02:49.550
<i>This is all
actually happening?</i>

01:02:49.552 --> 01:02:52.119
<i>Oh, my God. He-he killed Lexx.</i>

01:02:52.121 --> 01:02:54.355
<i>I... No...
I-I-I don't know.</i>

01:02:54.357 --> 01:02:56.657
<i>But he... he pushed her.
He-he-he bloody killed Lexx.</i>

01:02:56.659 --> 01:02:59.126
<i>If he was with Amaya, then how
could he have done that to Lexx?</i>

01:02:59.128 --> 01:03:01.262
<i>That's exactly the thing.
It wasn't him.</i>

01:03:01.264 --> 01:03:03.130
<i>- It must have been one of the others.
- The other what?</i>

01:03:03.132 --> 01:03:05.066
<i>The other... the Charons.
The ones who buy the videos,</i>

01:03:05.068 --> 01:03:07.236
<i>the ones who pick the girls.
They must have figured out</i>

01:03:07.238 --> 01:03:08.770
<i>- that the laptop got stolen.
- Oh, my God.</i>

01:03:08.772 --> 01:03:11.240
<i>Guys, they're not just gonna
let that evidence float around.</i>

01:03:11.242 --> 01:03:13.108
<i>So, all those videos,
they're all...</i>

01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:14.811
<i>This is damage control.
They're doing a clean-up.</i>

01:03:14.813 --> 01:03:17.079
<i>If they found Lexx, can they
find the rest of us, too?</i>

01:03:17.081 --> 01:03:19.248
<i>I am ghosted online.
They can't find me.</i>

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:21.851
<i>Okay. He's right, he's right.
You need to get to AJ's house.</i>

01:03:21.853 --> 01:03:25.421
<i>No, wait. Do not... No!
If these guys are that good...</i>

01:03:25.423 --> 01:03:28.491
<i>they can track cell phones, they can track
cars. Do not lead them to my place.</i>

01:03:28.493 --> 01:03:31.828
<i>Just listen to me, guys. You have to stay
online and act like nothing is wrong.</i>

01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:34.564
<i>What we can't do is sit around, wait
till someone shows up at our door.</i>

01:03:34.566 --> 01:03:37.133
<i>Wait. Wait, wait.</i>

01:03:37.135 --> 01:03:38.836
<i>How do we know
he's not listening now?</i>

01:03:38.838 --> 01:03:40.771
<i>Because of Facebook chat.
The green light,</i>

01:03:40.773 --> 01:03:42.373
<i>it goes off
when she loses connection.</i>

01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:44.275
<i>That's why I told her
to take the subway.</i>

01:03:44.277 --> 01:03:46.477
<i>So when she'd lose connection
and went underground,</i>

01:03:46.479 --> 01:03:48.479
<i>then I could tell you guys what
was fucking happening, all right?</i>

01:03:48.481 --> 01:03:52.316
<i>Look, there's no service in the station,
but there's Wi-Fi in the subway cars.</i>

01:03:52.318 --> 01:03:54.318
<i>So, as soon as she gets
on that train,</i>

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.220
<i>she's gonna have Wi-Fi again,
and so will he.</i>

01:03:56.222 --> 01:03:58.557
<i>All right? Let's just...
Can we just... can we just...</i>

01:03:58.559 --> 01:04:00.859
<i>Can we just play a game in the meantime,
act like nothing is happening?</i>

01:04:00.861 --> 01:04:03.762
<i>- I'll give him the laptop when he gets here.
- Wait. If he's watching,</i>

01:04:03.764 --> 01:04:06.131
<i>if he saw what happened to
Lexx, then doesn't he know?</i>

01:04:06.133 --> 01:04:07.933
<i>I don't... I don't know.
He hasn't said anything yet.</i>

01:04:07.935 --> 01:04:10.769
<i>So, uh, so it might have happened
when he didn't have connection or...</i>

01:04:13.841 --> 01:04:16.341
<i>Yo, AJ. AJ, AJ, dude,
get the hell out of there.</i>

01:04:16.343 --> 01:04:18.844
<i>- Get out. Get out of there.
- AJ, get out of there now.</i>

01:04:18.846 --> 01:04:20.913
<i>- AJ... AJ, get out!
- AJ, get out.</i>

01:04:20.915 --> 01:04:25.451
<i>Jesus Christ, Mom,
what are you...</i>

01:04:25.453 --> 01:04:27.653
<i>God.</i>

01:04:27.655 --> 01:04:29.890
<i>All right, all right, um,
all right, listen.</i>

01:04:29.892 --> 01:04:32.358
<i>I transferred all of the money, all of
the money into my account, all right?</i>

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.360
<i>- Just temporarily.
- Why didn't you tell us?</i>

01:04:34.362 --> 01:04:35.929
<i>Why, why didn't you try
and warn us?</i>

01:04:35.931 --> 01:04:37.764
<i>How could I have
warned you, Damon?</i>

01:04:37.766 --> 01:04:40.199
<i>If I did, Amaya would be...</i>

01:04:40.201 --> 01:04:42.235
<i>And I just did it
as insurance, all right?</i>

01:04:42.237 --> 01:04:43.770
<i>What, what about the laptop?
Isn't that enough insurance?</i>

01:04:43.772 --> 01:04:45.539
<i>He's, he's not gonna hurt
Amaya when you got...</i>

01:04:45.541 --> 01:04:47.874
<i>- Not just Amaya.
- You've got all his evidence!</i>

01:04:47.876 --> 01:04:49.610
<i>Erica Dunne.</i>

01:04:49.612 --> 01:04:51.378
<i>I told him he would get
the money back</i>

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:53.549
<i>once I knew
that she was free too.</i>

01:04:54.684 --> 01:04:55.685
<i>Oh.</i>

01:04:57.721 --> 01:05:00.521
<i>Matty, you are so dead.</i>

01:05:00.523 --> 01:05:02.924
<i>What the hell else
was I supposed to do?</i>

01:05:02.926 --> 01:05:04.726
<i>You saw what he does
to those people.</i>

01:05:04.728 --> 01:05:06.394
<i>What'd you think was gonna
happen? You think he was just</i>

01:05:06.396 --> 01:05:09.366
<i>gonna take the laptop
and walk away?</i>

01:05:11.401 --> 01:05:14.335
<i>I know what
I'm asking you to do is...</i>

01:05:14.337 --> 01:05:16.204
<i>Amaya's gonna be here
in five minutes,</i>

01:05:16.206 --> 01:05:18.974
<i>and I can't promise you that
in those five minutes</i>

01:05:18.976 --> 01:05:21.410
<i>that no one else is gonna
show up at your door,</i>

01:05:21.412 --> 01:05:23.579
<i>but...</i>

01:05:23.581 --> 01:05:26.415
<i>Guys, if we don't do this,
Amaya's...</i>

01:05:26.417 --> 01:05:28.552
<i>Please.</i>

01:05:42.801 --> 01:05:43.833
<i>Okay.</i>

01:05:43.835 --> 01:05:46.371
<i>So, uh, who wants to go first?</i>

01:05:53.513 --> 01:05:54.580
<i>I'll go.</i>

01:05:57.016 --> 01:05:59.452
<i>Yeah, well, that one sucks.</i>

01:06:04.724 --> 01:06:07.625
<i>Um, my gym teacher got fired</i>

01:06:07.627 --> 01:06:08.827
<i>for adding blank</i>

01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:11.632
<i>to the obstacle course.</i>

01:06:20.808 --> 01:06:22.609
<i>Too much cocaine.</i>

01:06:23.845 --> 01:06:25.712
<i>Velcro.</i>

01:06:25.714 --> 01:06:28.750
<i>Uh, depression.</i>

01:06:31.285 --> 01:06:32.585
<i>I like Velcro.</i>

01:06:36.024 --> 01:06:38.526
<i>Thought depression
was pretty good.</i>

01:06:39.928 --> 01:06:41.694
<i>All right, I'll go.</i>

01:06:41.696 --> 01:06:43.764
<i>Uh, or do you wanna go, Damon?</i>

01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:47.500
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, all right.
- Yeah? Um, all right.</i>

01:06:47.502 --> 01:06:50.637
<i>Um, uh, in his new action,</i>

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:53.674
<i>in his new action comedy,
Jackie Chan must fend off</i>

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:55.642
<i>- ninjas while also...
- Hey, uh, Nari.</i>

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:58.512
<i>Uh, Nari, we're, we're,
we're trying to play.</i>

01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:00.647
<i>- Uh, uh...
- Sorry.</i>

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:01.950
<i>A horse with no legs.</i>

01:07:01.952 --> 01:07:04.686
<i>- What, uh, what is...
- Right?</i>

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:07.591
<i>Uh, go around...
going around punching people.</i>

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:09.991
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:11.059
<i>That's... you would pick that.</i>

01:07:11.061 --> 01:07:12.894
<i>That's pretty good try.</i>

01:07:12.896 --> 01:07:14.662
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:16.397
<i>Matias, give me access
to the laptop.</i>

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:17.866
<i>System Preferences,
Users and Groups,</i>

01:07:17.868 --> 01:07:21.603
<i>Add User, make sure you give me
administrative access.</i>

01:07:21.605 --> 01:07:23.638
<i>Wait, I'm just...
What are you gonna be doing?</i>

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.406
<i>I am gonna back-up
all the videos</i>

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:26.742
<i>and I'm gonna go
through location services,</i>

01:07:26.744 --> 01:07:28.778
<i>in case we can find out
where the laptop's been,</i>

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.980
<i>then maybe we can find
the missing girl.</i>

01:07:30.982 --> 01:07:32.448
<i>Wait, what do you mean?</i>

01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:33.682
<i>Are we...
don't worry, okay?</i>

01:07:33.684 --> 01:07:35.351
<i>What are you... what... no.</i>

01:07:35.353 --> 01:07:36.418
<i>You guys, my friend
on the force,</i>

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.620
<i>he's coming over here, so...</i>

01:07:37.622 --> 01:07:38.687
<i>Um...</i>

01:07:38.689 --> 01:07:40.924
<i>Okay.</i>

01:07:40.926 --> 01:07:42.159
<i>Um, blank.</i>

01:07:42.161 --> 01:07:45.495
<i>Awesome in theory,
kind of a mess in practice.</i>

01:07:45.497 --> 01:07:49.633
<i>Um, uh, the swim team,</i>

01:07:49.635 --> 01:07:50.702
<i>all at once.</i>

01:07:53.505 --> 01:07:54.971
<i>Okay, he's gone.
AJ, AJ, AJ,</i>

01:07:54.973 --> 01:07:56.640
<i>as soon as Amaya
gets to my place,</i>

01:07:56.642 --> 01:07:58.109
<i>you disconnect,
and you and your mom</i>

01:07:58.111 --> 01:07:59.309
<i>get the hell out of your house.
All right?</i>

01:07:59.311 --> 01:08:01.511
<i>You're the only one
who might not be safe.</i>

01:08:01.513 --> 01:08:03.513
<i>Uh, Damon's in London,
they can't get to him.</i>

01:08:03.515 --> 01:08:05.082
<i>And Nari's got a friend
on the force,</i>

01:08:05.084 --> 01:08:06.751
<i>so, so the cops
are already on their way.</i>

01:08:06.753 --> 01:08:07.819
<i>Okay, listen,</i>

01:08:07.821 --> 01:08:09.787
<i>you guys cannot stay there.</i>

01:08:09.789 --> 01:08:10.955
<i>No, no, no.
We're not going to.</i>

01:08:10.957 --> 01:08:12.358
<i>Wait, wait, wait, uh...</i>

01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:17.462
<i>Um...</i>

01:08:25.872 --> 01:08:28.740
<i>Hey, um, Amaya's...
Amaya's gonna be late.</i>

01:08:28.742 --> 01:08:30.843
<i>She says there's something
wrong with the subway.</i>

01:08:30.845 --> 01:08:32.511
<i>Do you, uh... do you guys...</i>

01:08:32.513 --> 01:08:34.779
<i>Can you guys play
a little bit longer?</i>

01:08:34.782 --> 01:08:37.549
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I, um, totally.</i>

01:08:37.551 --> 01:08:39.685
<i>- Okay.
- Hey, uh, Serena?</i>

01:08:39.688 --> 01:08:41.087
<i>Serena, Nari.</i>

01:08:41.089 --> 01:08:43.622
<i>- Serena?
- Guys.</i>

01:08:43.625 --> 01:08:44.658
<i>Hello?</i>

01:08:46.627 --> 01:08:50.697
<i>Uh, sorry, guys. Um, Nari's
skipping this round.</i>

01:08:50.698 --> 01:08:55.169
<i>Uh... Matias,
can we play something else?</i>

01:08:55.171 --> 01:08:56.770
<i>I'm getting, getting sick
of this game.</i>

01:08:56.772 --> 01:08:58.706
<i>- How much longer?
- How much longer for...</i>

01:08:58.707 --> 01:09:00.207
<i>Where did the subway
break down?</i>

01:09:00.209 --> 01:09:03.077
<i>Let me... let me just...
let me ask.</i>

01:09:08.783 --> 01:09:11.752
<i>Uh, it's, uh,
Western Boulevard.</i>

01:09:11.754 --> 01:09:13.154
<i>Western Boulevard.</i>

01:09:13.156 --> 01:09:15.790
<i>Not far. Uh...</i>

01:09:15.792 --> 01:09:17.826
<i>What's going on
with Nari?</i>

01:09:17.828 --> 01:09:19.460
<i>Bathroom.
She's not feeling well.</i>

01:09:19.462 --> 01:09:20.831
<i>Might be a while.</i>

01:09:32.743 --> 01:09:35.211
<i>Oh, you know what, fuck around
all you want, asshole!</i>

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:37.545
<i>- AJ! Dude!
- I got this shit all tied up!</i>

01:09:37.546 --> 01:09:39.814
<i>- Do your worst!
- It's gone, it's gone, AJ.</i>

01:09:40.818 --> 01:09:42.885
<i>I am so sick and tired</i>

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:46.022
<i>of all you sheeple not being
sick and tired enough</i>

01:09:46.024 --> 01:09:47.823
<i>to get off your...</i>

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:52.229

and explosives...</i>

01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:24.898
<i>weapons and explosives...</i>

01:10:33.607 --> 01:10:35.874
<i>911, please state
the nature of your emergency.</i>

01:10:35.876 --> 01:10:38.911
<i>I am sick and tired
of all... the corruption.</i>

01:10:38.913 --> 01:10:40.679
<i>Sir,
is this a real emergency?</i>

01:10:40.681 --> 01:10:41.680
<i>I'm gonna pack up all my...</i>

01:10:41.682 --> 01:10:43.549
<i>assault weapons
and explosives.</i>

01:10:43.551 --> 01:10:45.318
<i>Go downtown to the mall
and have some fun.</i>

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.120
<i>Sir, can you
tell me your name?</i>

01:10:47.122 --> 01:10:49.557
<i>Jeffcock is a family name.</i>

01:10:52.227 --> 01:10:53.662
<i>Wait...</i>

01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:57.330
<i>They made that call
two minutes ago.</i>

01:10:57.332 --> 01:10:59.266
<i>AJ, you need to get out of...</i>

01:10:59.268 --> 01:11:00.967
<i>Police!
We have a search warrant!</i>

01:11:00.969 --> 01:11:02.702
<i>No, I...</i>

01:11:02.704 --> 01:11:04.804
<i>AJ, just get on the ground
right now, all right?</i>

01:11:04.806 --> 01:11:06.841
<i>AJ, get on the...
get on the damn ground!</i>

01:11:06.843 --> 01:11:08.843
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Get on the ground!</i>

01:11:08.845 --> 01:11:10.945
<i>- Get on the ground now!
- What's going on?</i>

01:11:10.947 --> 01:11:12.913
<i>- Where is your son?
- The basement.</i>

01:11:12.915 --> 01:11:14.782
<i>Wait, wait, wait. What's this
on the screen right here?</i>

01:11:14.784 --> 01:11:16.784
<i>- What's on the screen?
- It's AJ's desktop.</i>

01:11:16.786 --> 01:11:19.687
<i>- What is...
- They're into his computer.</i>

01:11:19.689 --> 01:11:21.856
<i>They're uploading something.</i>

01:11:21.858 --> 01:11:24.692
<i>- Police, open the door!
- I can't. I'm on the ground.</i>

01:11:24.694 --> 01:11:26.795
<i>Open the door
or we'll break it down.</i>

01:11:26.797 --> 01:11:29.197
<i>Okay. Okay, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>

01:11:29.199 --> 01:11:31.133
<i>- Stay down.
- Oh, my God!</i>

01:11:31.135 --> 01:11:32.200
<i>Open the door!</i>

01:11:32.202 --> 01:11:33.368
<i>I'm coming! I'm coming!</i>

01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:34.836
<i>- No! AJ!
- No! No! No!</i>

01:11:34.838 --> 01:11:36.238
<i>- AJ! No!
- Stay on the ground.</i>

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.341
<i>- No. AJ!
- Don't! AJ!</i>

01:11:38.343 --> 01:11:40.376
<i>- No! No, no, no. Stay!
- No!</i>

01:11:40.378 --> 01:11:43.146
<i>AJ! No! AJ!</i>

01:11:43.148 --> 01:11:45.982
<i>No! No! No!</i>

01:11:45.984 --> 01:11:47.050
<i>Gun, gun!</i>

01:11:51.289 --> 01:11:53.124
<i>Oh, my...</i>

01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:00.364
<i>Suspect down.</i>

01:12:12.278 --> 01:12:14.013
<i>Oh, AJ.</i>

01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:19.850
<i>No.</i>

01:12:19.852 --> 01:12:20.954
<i>Fuck.</i>

01:12:23.123 --> 01:12:24.991
<i>Matias, Damon...</i>

01:12:30.664 --> 01:12:31.896
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:12:31.898 --> 01:12:33.731
<i>Oh.</i>

01:12:33.733 --> 01:12:35.133
<i>He's gonna kill Amaya</i>

01:12:35.135 --> 01:12:36.901
<i>as soon as that train
reaches the station.</i>

01:12:36.903 --> 01:12:38.770
<i>No, Nari is on her way there
right now.</i>

01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:40.306
<i>- What?
- Yeah, she's gonna try</i>

01:12:40.308 --> 01:12:41.874
<i>and get there before
they can get to her.</i>

01:12:41.876 --> 01:12:43.342
<i>I can...
I can get there faster.</i>

01:12:43.344 --> 01:12:44.745
<i>I'm gonna go now.</i>

01:12:48.082 --> 01:12:49.782
<i>What...</i>

01:12:49.784 --> 01:12:51.085
<i>what's going on?</i>

01:13:12.074 --> 01:13:14.710
<i>Bye, love you.</i>

01:13:15.711 --> 01:13:17.711
<i>So, here's the only thing.</i>

01:13:17.713 --> 01:13:19.080
<i>We were gonna tell them
tonight,</i>

01:13:19.082 --> 01:13:20.248
<i>and over Skype.</i>

01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:21.782
<i>Do you wanna...</i>

01:13:21.784 --> 01:13:23.151
<i>Do you wanna not
tell them tonight or,</i>

01:13:23.153 --> 01:13:25.419
<i>- or what...
- No, it's perfect,</i>

01:13:25.421 --> 01:13:26.488
<i>because this way,</i>

01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:29.759
<i>Damon gets to be there
for the news.</i>

01:13:30.927 --> 01:13:32.860
<i>AJ will be fine.
He's a big boy.</i>

01:13:32.862 --> 01:13:34.463
<i>- Uh-hmm.
- He's a big boy.</i>

01:13:34.465 --> 01:13:36.498
<i>Big boy that'll
probably show up a lot</i>

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.133
<i>in symbolic protests.</i>

01:13:38.135 --> 01:13:40.235
<i>That's probably true.</i>

01:13:40.237 --> 01:13:41.770
<i>On a white horse.</i>

01:13:41.772 --> 01:13:44.072
<i>- Like, he would love that.
- Yeah.</i>

01:13:44.074 --> 01:13:45.340
<i>Or with a boom-box.</i>

01:13:45.342 --> 01:13:49.111
<i>Just John Cusack style.</i>

01:13:49.113 --> 01:13:50.979
<i>And then we can put him
at your parents' table.</i>

01:13:50.981 --> 01:13:54.152
<i>That'll be all the energy
we all need.</i>

01:13:57.822 --> 01:13:59.958
<i>They're not coming, so....</i>

01:14:04.763 --> 01:14:07.063
<i>You think they would magically
change their minds</i>

01:14:07.065 --> 01:14:09.233
<i>and become modern?</i>

01:14:09.235 --> 01:14:12.837
<i>I mean, I'm just...
their only daughter, so...</i>

01:14:13.539 --> 01:14:15.005
<i>My mom.</i>

01:14:15.007 --> 01:14:16.540
<i>No, your mom's gonna be okay.</i>

01:14:16.542 --> 01:14:19.310
<i>- No. Nari.
- She's... No, she has to be.</i>

01:14:21.214 --> 01:14:23.849
<i>She's never gonna leave
that hospital.</i>

01:14:26.085 --> 01:14:27.385
<i>Well, then, then,</i>

01:14:27.387 --> 01:14:30.121
<i>let's, let's get married
tonight in her room,</i>

01:14:30.123 --> 01:14:32.991
<i>and, and we can bring
the paperwork and...</i>

01:14:32.993 --> 01:14:33.757
<i>In the ICU?</i>

01:14:33.759 --> 01:14:35.227
<i>And she'll be our witness.</i>

01:14:35.229 --> 01:14:36.263
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

01:14:38.465 --> 01:14:40.734
<i>I love that idea.</i>

01:14:42.369 --> 01:14:44.004
<i>But it's not the point.</i>

01:14:45.473 --> 01:14:47.975
<i>I don't want you
to have to choose</i>

01:14:49.377 --> 01:14:51.010
<i>between me and them.</i>

01:14:51.012 --> 01:14:53.279
<i>That's...</i>

01:14:53.281 --> 01:14:54.882
<i>It's not fair.</i>

01:15:00.021 --> 01:15:02.888
<i>I don't want you
to have to choose.</i>

01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:05.226
<i>I don't want you
to have to choose.</i>

01:15:10.466 --> 01:15:13.302
<i>Wait, it's... That's Nari.</i>

01:15:24.581 --> 01:15:27.881
<i>Wait.
Who, who, who is that?</i>

01:15:27.883 --> 01:15:29.319
<i>That's my mom.</i>

01:15:36.426 --> 01:15:38.092
<i>Oh, God!</i>

01:15:43.867 --> 01:15:46.000
<i>No, no, no! No, no!</i>

01:15:46.002 --> 01:15:47.202
<i>I will do anything.</i>

01:15:47.204 --> 01:15:48.404
<i>Stop this right now!</i>

01:15:48.406 --> 01:15:49.806
<i>I will do any...</i>

01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:53.942
<i>Please!</i>

01:15:53.944 --> 01:15:56.078
<i>Please, don't do this.</i>

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.213
<i>You can have me.
I don't care,</i>

01:15:58.215 --> 01:16:00.215
<i>just, please, stop!</i>

01:16:00.217 --> 01:16:01.518
<i>Please, please,</i>

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.354
<i>please, please!</i>

01:16:04.356 --> 01:16:06.222
<i>Oh, God!</i>

01:16:09.494 --> 01:16:12.262
<i>No!</i>

01:16:12.264 --> 01:16:14.397
<i>No, I can't.</i>

01:16:14.399 --> 01:16:16.399
<i>I can't.</i>

01:16:16.401 --> 01:16:18.371
<i>I can't.</i>

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.974
<i>No, no.</i>

01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:27.311
<i>No.</i>

01:16:27.313 --> 01:16:28.314
<i>I won't.</i>

01:16:36.657 --> 01:16:37.689
<i>No!</i>

01:16:39.158 --> 01:16:40.927
<i>Nari.</i>

01:16:42.529 --> 01:16:45.163
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:16:45.165 --> 01:16:47.034
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:16:49.336 --> 01:16:50.337
<i>No.</i>

01:16:54.308 --> 01:16:55.541
<i>No.</i>

01:16:55.543 --> 01:16:57.109
<i>No!</i>

01:16:57.111 --> 01:16:58.176
<i>Dammit!</i>

01:16:58.178 --> 01:16:59.312
<i>No!</i>

01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:01.481
<i>Oh, God!</i>

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:03.118
<i>No!</i>

01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:09.055
<i>No!</i>

01:17:09.057 --> 01:17:11.157
<i>Nari!</i>

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:13.226
<i>Nari!</i>

01:17:13.228 --> 01:17:15.196
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:19.166
<i>I'm sorry, Serena,</i>

01:17:19.168 --> 01:17:20.902
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:26.306
<i>Serena, Serena,
get out of there right now!</i>

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:27.742
<i>Serena,
oh, get out of there.</i>

01:17:27.744 --> 01:17:29.343
<i>Serena, get out of there
right now!</i>

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:40.321
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:17:53.203 --> 01:17:53.968
<i>Listen to me.</i>

01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:55.638
<i>I want you to listen to me,</i>

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:58.041
<i>whoever I'm talking
to right now.</i>

01:17:58.743 --> 01:18:00.576
<i>Amaya, my...</i>

01:18:00.578 --> 01:18:03.179
<i>She has nothing to do
with any of this, okay?</i>

01:18:03.181 --> 01:18:04.647
<i>She hasn't even...
she doesn't even know</i>

01:18:04.649 --> 01:18:06.650
<i>I found the laptop,
all right?</i>

01:18:06.652 --> 01:18:08.451
<i>The guy who lost it...
the guy who lost it,</i>

01:18:08.453 --> 01:18:10.487
<i>he's, he's on the subway train
with her.</i>

01:18:10.489 --> 01:18:11.621
<i>He's wearing a gray hoodie,</i>

01:18:11.623 --> 01:18:13.189
<i>this is all his fault, okay?</i>

01:18:13.191 --> 01:18:16.161
<i>She has nothing,
nothing to do with it!</i>

01:18:17.496 --> 01:18:19.596
<i>Please!</i>

01:18:19.598 --> 01:18:21.531
<i>I'll delete everything, okay?</i>

01:18:21.533 --> 01:18:24.067
<i>You'll have nothing
to trace back to me, I swear.</i>

01:18:24.069 --> 01:18:27.072
<i>If, if you kill him...</i>

01:18:28.207 --> 01:18:29.640
<i>I don't care what you do to me,</i>

01:18:29.642 --> 01:18:31.208
<i>I don't care what you do to me,</i>

01:18:31.210 --> 01:18:34.481
<i>but just please leave Amaya
out of this!</i>

01:19:17.626 --> 01:19:19.327
<i>No, no, no,
no, no, no.</i>

01:19:20.796 --> 01:19:22.696
<i>Baby...</i>

01:19:22.698 --> 01:19:24.132
<i>okay?</i>

01:19:33.175 --> 01:19:35.509
<i>What?
Slow, slow, slow, slow.</i>

01:19:35.511 --> 01:19:36.512
<i>Slow.</i>

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:45.254
<i>Um...</i>

01:19:55.832 --> 01:19:57.499
<i>Go, go.</i>

01:19:57.501 --> 01:20:00.235
<i>Go, go.</i>

01:20:00.237 --> 01:20:02.470
<i>All right, uh,
you're going to get her, man?</i>

01:20:02.472 --> 01:20:03.839
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:05.908
<i>All right, just make sure
you leave the computer open</i>

01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:07.443
<i>because I got to keep
downloading the video files.</i>

01:20:07.445 --> 01:20:09.879
<i>- Uh, okay.
- Now, Matias, just be careful,</i>

01:20:09.881 --> 01:20:12.417
<i>- yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

01:20:30.703 --> 01:20:32.571
<i>You're there, aren't you?</i>

01:20:39.445 --> 01:20:41.514
<i>Guess what?
I have been recording.</i>

01:20:42.649 --> 01:20:44.283
<i>I've got the whole thing.</i>

01:20:45.719 --> 01:20:48.453
<i>You should have dealt
with Matias.</i>

01:20:48.455 --> 01:20:50.455
<i>He was gonna give
the computer back.</i>

01:20:50.457 --> 01:20:53.458
<i>He was gonna give it back
and forget the whole thing,</i>

01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.595
<i>but that is not
what I'm gonna do.</i>

01:20:59.734 --> 01:21:00.933
<i>You see this?</i>

01:21:00.935 --> 01:21:02.668
<i>Do you know what this is?</i>

01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:03.836
<i>This is coordinates.</i>

01:21:03.838 --> 01:21:05.904
<i>This is everywhere
that computer has been.</i>

01:21:05.906 --> 01:21:07.840
<i>This is going to lead them
to Erica Dunne,</i>

01:21:07.842 --> 01:21:09.675
<i>and every single girl you took.</i>

01:21:09.677 --> 01:21:11.178
<i>You are finished!</i>

01:21:45.715 --> 01:21:47.350
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:22:01.932 --> 01:22:03.665
<i>- Damon, Damon, what's up?
- Matias,</i>

01:22:03.667 --> 01:22:05.734
<i>Matias, he didn't lose
the laptop.</i>

01:22:05.736 --> 01:22:07.636
<i>Charon IV, he left it
there deliberately.</i>

01:22:07.638 --> 01:22:10.006
<i>He wanted it to be found.
They all wanted it to be found.</i>

01:22:10.008 --> 01:22:12.775
<i>See, it was a lure.
They were phishing.</i>

01:22:12.777 --> 01:22:15.343
<i>Uh, from the moment you entered
your Wi-Fi password,</i>

01:22:15.345 --> 01:22:17.480
<i>they were in, they've had
control this whole time.</i>

01:22:17.482 --> 01:22:19.582
<i>Damon, I'm sorry,
but what are you...</i>

01:22:19.584 --> 01:22:20.983
