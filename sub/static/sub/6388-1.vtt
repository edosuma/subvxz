00:00.355 --> 00:02.360
Previously on Californication...

00:02.405 --> 00:04.139
You're amazing.
A goddess.

00:04.174 --> 00:06.342
You deserve the white dress
and the happy ending.

00:06.376 --> 00:07.776
I'm just not the guy to give it to you.

00:07.811 --> 00:09.178
This man's a monster.

00:09.212 --> 00:11.580
He likes to fuck women in the ass,

00:11.614 --> 00:14.996
and then tell them that he just
wants to keep it casual.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.351
Guys, it's really nice
to be fought over, but--

00:17.385 --> 00:18.886
Oh, my God! This is never
going anywhere, is it?

00:18.920 --> 00:19.632
What?

00:19.752 --> 00:21.922
You're never going to be able
to commit to another woman.

00:21.956 --> 00:24.691
Congratulations, Karen.
I don't know how you did it, but--

00:24.726 --> 00:25.959
What?

00:25.994 --> 00:27.045
I will love you till the end of time.

00:27.165 --> 00:29.196
But I can no longer be your husband.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.864
It's such a fucking relief.

00:30.899 --> 00:32.064
Now what?

00:32.100 --> 00:34.067
You stay here, stand still,

00:34.102 --> 00:35.007
don't move.

00:35.127 --> 00:37.037
Here, tonight, have dinner with me.

00:37.071 --> 00:39.473
God damn it,
the truth just sounds better.

00:40.909 --> 00:42.643
Oof!

00:42.677 --> 00:44.745
Just, come on,
tell me "I love you."

00:44.779 --> 00:46.547
Just one time, tell me.

00:46.581 --> 00:47.714
Just come home.

00:47.749 --> 00:49.550
- I saw that!
- Ho! Jesus.

00:49.584 --> 00:50.884
Oh, I think it's the pills.

00:50.919 --> 00:52.252
What pills?

00:52.287 --> 00:53.554
I probably shouldn't be drinking.

00:53.588 --> 00:54.822
I started taking these antidepressants.

00:54.856 --> 00:55.989
How many of these did you take?

00:56.024 --> 00:57.324
No more than you did.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.159
What did--
what did you do?

00:59.194 --> 01:02.696
Carrie, what did you do?

01:02.730 --> 01:05.599
Only what you made me.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.067
Tell me you love me.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.141
Can I get you a drink?

01:48.176 --> 01:50.277
Um, I think that's my line.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.412
Ah. Hank.

01:52.447 --> 01:54.047

- And...

01:54.082 --> 01:56.587
- It's nice to meet me?

01:56.707 --> 01:58.452
I'm not sure,
but I think this is the part

01:58.486 --> 01:59.731
where you tell me your name.

01:59.851 --> 02:00.867
Why would I do that?

02:00.987 --> 02:03.237
Because that's what we
do in polite society, lady.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.592
That's what separates us
from the monkeys.

02:05.627 --> 02:07.782
And people from Long Island.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.466
- Karen, Karen, Karen.
- Why are you doing that?

02:12.500 --> 02:14.067
It's just so not what I expected.

02:14.102 --> 02:15.857
What? What did you expect?

02:15.977 --> 02:17.116
Something more exotic.

02:17.384 --> 02:19.319
I mean, you seem like a Sasha.

02:19.353 --> 02:21.187
Or a--or a Pasha.

02:21.221 --> 02:23.823
- Pasha?
- Definitely an "Asha" of some sort.

02:23.857 --> 02:25.224
I'm sorry to disappoint.

02:25.259 --> 02:26.759
I'm not disappointed.

02:26.794 --> 02:29.095
I mean, if I was any more excited,

02:29.129 --> 02:31.497
my enormous man-sized diaper
would be soaking wet.

02:31.532 --> 02:33.199
And that would be embarrassing.

02:33.233 --> 02:34.867
- That's disgusting.
- Yet endearing.

02:34.902 --> 02:36.234
Not really.

02:36.481 --> 02:38.160
Refill?

02:40.240 --> 02:43.609
How are you feeling, Hank?

02:43.644 --> 02:47.347
Because I'm starting
to feel really fucking groovy.

02:47.381 --> 02:49.682
What did you do?

02:49.717 --> 02:53.619
Only what you made me...

02:53.654 --> 02:57.123
Tell me you love me.

03:06.600 --> 03:10.470
Hello again.

03:10.504 --> 03:11.938
I love you.

03:11.972 --> 03:15.308
I'm gonna let some light in.

03:15.342 --> 03:19.312
Hey, tell me...

03:21.949 --> 03:23.916
- What do you remember?
- Hmm?

03:23.951 --> 03:26.319
I remember everything...
Karen.

03:26.353 --> 03:28.454
No.
About that night.

03:28.456 --> 03:29.216
- Oh.
- You never...

03:30.190 --> 03:31.958
You didn't show up for dinner.

03:31.992 --> 03:33.960
I kept calling you.
You didn't pick up.

03:33.994 --> 03:36.929
I got worried,
so I drove up to Charlie's.

03:36.964 --> 03:38.664
And when I arrived, the door was open.

03:38.699 --> 03:43.569
And that's--
that's where I found you.

03:43.604 --> 03:44.904
And her.

03:44.938 --> 03:47.974
- Carrie?
- Yeah.

03:48.008 --> 03:51.043
I didn't fuck her, Karen.
I swear.

03:51.078 --> 03:53.379
It so doesn't matter.

03:53.414 --> 03:57.784
It so does matter.

03:57.818 --> 04:00.486
She made me a drink.

04:00.521 --> 04:02.989
A really strong drink.

04:03.023 --> 04:04.824
Apparently.

04:04.858 --> 04:06.726
Am I gonna be okay?

04:06.760 --> 04:09.095
You've been in and out
for a couple of days now.

04:09.129 --> 04:12.064
But the doctors...

04:12.099 --> 04:14.333
they think you're gonna be fine.

04:14.368 --> 04:18.805
Well, too bad for you.

04:18.839 --> 04:23.109
What about her?

04:38.025 --> 04:39.826
Hank?

04:41.495 --> 04:43.629
You don't remember me, do you?

04:43.664 --> 04:45.431
We had dinner once.

04:45.466 --> 04:47.366
You're her friend.

04:47.401 --> 04:49.202
Melissa, right?

04:49.236 --> 04:50.369
Sarah.

04:50.404 --> 04:52.872
Sarah.
Apologies.

04:52.906 --> 04:55.675
- Sorry.
- No worries.

04:55.709 --> 04:58.377
We're all interchangeable,
right, us ladies?

04:58.412 --> 05:00.646
No, that's--
that's not me.

05:00.681 --> 05:02.715
I-I don't think that way.

05:02.749 --> 05:04.550
Uh-huh.

05:04.585 --> 05:06.953
How is she?

05:06.987 --> 05:08.688
Well, uh...

05:08.722 --> 05:12.358
She's been on life support
since she got here.

05:12.392 --> 05:14.727
No signs of improvement.

05:14.761 --> 05:17.296
No signs of anything really.

05:17.331 --> 05:19.065
She's gone.

05:19.099 --> 05:21.734
We're just waiting for
the parents to pull the plug.

05:21.768 --> 05:23.469
See, unlike you,

05:23.504 --> 05:26.506
they're having a really
hard time letting her go.

05:26.540 --> 05:29.075
She loved you, Hank.

05:29.109 --> 05:31.344
Despite all the evidence
to the contrary,

05:31.378 --> 05:33.579
she thought you were the one.

05:33.614 --> 05:35.214
No matter how many times I told her

05:35.249 --> 05:37.049
to let you go or just walk away,

05:37.084 --> 05:38.684
she wouldn't do it.

05:38.719 --> 05:41.254
I just wish
you would have let her down

05:41.288 --> 05:43.256
a little easier.

05:43.290 --> 05:46.859
A little sooner.

05:48.295 --> 05:49.962
How dare you!

05:49.997 --> 05:51.564
Get the fuck out of here!

05:51.598 --> 05:53.833
Or do you want to wait
till the parents come here?

05:53.867 --> 05:58.070
Because they'll be here any minute.

05:58.105 --> 06:01.073
- Sweetie, are you okay?
- No, no, no.

06:01.108 --> 06:02.842
Just leave me alone.

06:16.590 --> 06:19.091
Slow down, buddy.

06:19.126 --> 06:20.993
- You're approaching blotto.
- Thank goodness.

06:21.028 --> 06:22.328
You know what that means.

06:22.362 --> 06:24.230
Next stop, blackout station.

06:24.264 --> 06:25.784
I could have gotten there a lot sooner,

06:25.799 --> 06:27.600
but who's the squishy little pussy fart

06:27.634 --> 06:29.268
who wouldn't go buy drugs with me?

06:29.303 --> 06:30.670
Just wanted to get you out of the house.

06:30.704 --> 06:32.371
Blow the stink off.

06:34.408 --> 06:36.175
I like my stink.

06:36.209 --> 06:38.844
It's like obsession for dirt bags.

06:38.879 --> 06:44.116
So I have an offer for you!

06:46.954 --> 06:49.755
Not even a smile?
You always laugh when I do that.

06:49.790 --> 06:52.291
I don't feel very much
like laughing these days.

06:52.326 --> 06:53.726
Or working, for that matter.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.394
The very thought
makes my asshole quiver.

06:55.429 --> 06:58.030
No, actually, more like a throb.

06:58.065 --> 06:59.765
Have you ever had
a throbbing asshole, Charlie?

06:59.800 --> 07:02.368
- I have.
- I bet.

07:02.402 --> 07:04.770
You've been home a week, Hank.

07:04.805 --> 07:06.405
You're lucky to be alive.

07:06.440 --> 07:07.773
You're just sitting around
pulverizing your liver.

07:07.808 --> 07:09.141
Yeah, that.

07:09.176 --> 07:12.078
And I'm contemplating a new novel!

07:12.112 --> 07:14.647
That's great!
Really?

07:14.681 --> 07:16.401
Yeah, it's about
a miserable piece of shit

07:16.416 --> 07:17.416
who drinks himself to death.

07:17.451 --> 07:18.751
I'm in the research phase.

07:18.785 --> 07:21.554
You got to get past this, man.

07:21.588 --> 07:23.089
You got to forgive yourself.

07:23.123 --> 07:24.490
I don't got to do nothing

07:24.524 --> 07:26.404
but stay black and die,
motherfucker.

07:26.426 --> 07:28.094
It wasn't your fault.

07:28.128 --> 07:29.962
She was fucking looney tunes!

07:29.997 --> 07:31.797
She tried to kill you, Hank.

07:34.868 --> 07:36.302
Ow!

07:36.336 --> 07:37.570
Fuck!

07:37.604 --> 07:38.904
What did you do that for?

07:38.939 --> 07:40.506
You can't talk about her like that.

07:40.540 --> 07:42.108
Some crazy bitch tries to kill you,

07:42.142 --> 07:43.442
you defend her honor.

07:43.477 --> 07:44.977
Your best friend tries to help you,

07:45.012 --> 07:46.579
you punch him in the face.

07:46.613 --> 07:48.047
You're a real fucking asshole,
you know that?

07:48.081 --> 07:49.582
That sounds about right.

07:57.491 --> 07:59.759
What do you see us becoming, eventually?

07:59.793 --> 08:01.994
Look, you're amazing, okay?

08:02.029 --> 08:03.596
Uh, I just, um...

08:03.630 --> 08:06.432
Come on, just out with it.

08:06.466 --> 08:08.401
- Just say it.
- Excuse me?

08:08.435 --> 08:09.835
You're excused, Nancy.

08:09.870 --> 08:11.570
But just--
just rip the band-aid off.

08:11.605 --> 08:12.938
It's the only decent thing to do.

08:12.973 --> 08:14.907
Thanks. Thanks
for the advice, old-timer.

08:14.941 --> 08:16.308
Oh, hey, I may be old.

08:16.343 --> 08:17.810
But I'm not such a geezer

08:17.844 --> 08:20.012
that I can't dick-slap the shit
out of you.

08:20.047 --> 08:21.681
My father used to always say that to me.

08:21.715 --> 08:23.983
- Oh, good old dad.
- Yeah, he's right.

08:24.017 --> 08:25.284
If you're gonna break up
with me, just do it.

08:25.318 --> 08:26.919
You go, girl.

08:26.953 --> 08:28.454
That's not what I'm doing.

08:28.488 --> 08:30.089
No, what you're doing
is wasting my time.

08:30.123 --> 08:31.624
If you aren't serious about me,
about us,

08:31.658 --> 08:34.626
- then I need to know.
- Need to know!

08:34.660 --> 08:36.595
You know...

08:36.630 --> 08:40.166
If you would have just let me finish.

08:45.672 --> 08:47.940
You fucking asshole.

08:47.974 --> 08:50.242
You fucked up my proposal.

08:52.746 --> 08:53.879
Fair enough.

09:20.674 --> 09:21.874
Daddy?

09:21.908 --> 09:23.409
Fuck me!

09:23.443 --> 09:25.711
You smell funny.

09:30.484 --> 09:33.853
Hey, what's up slugger?

09:33.887 --> 09:35.488
Hmm.

09:35.522 --> 09:38.657
Guess what?
I'm the Tooth Fairy, yeah?

09:38.692 --> 09:42.561
What do you say we, uh,
settle this like men.

09:42.596 --> 09:44.130
All right?

09:44.164 --> 09:46.699
No screaming?

09:46.733 --> 09:47.767
Yeah?

09:51.905 --> 09:56.509
I think you'll find it's all there.

10:05.418 --> 10:07.153
You're lucky I have cool neighbors.

10:07.187 --> 10:09.054
I don't know how cool they are.

10:09.089 --> 10:12.358
They left their kid's
bedroom door wide fucking open.

10:12.392 --> 10:14.927
You're lucky you didn't try
anything with that kid.

10:14.961 --> 10:17.029
Why the fuck would I do that?

10:17.063 --> 10:18.430
I don't know.

10:18.465 --> 10:19.765
It's dark.
You're drunk.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.034
Holes is holes, Hank.

10:22.068 --> 10:24.236
You should be tested
for something, Charlie.

10:24.271 --> 10:25.671
- Arms.
- Not sure exactly what,

10:25.705 --> 10:27.606
but you're definitely on the spectrum.

10:27.641 --> 10:30.776
Reach for the sky.
It's beddy-bye.

10:33.713 --> 10:35.881
Oh, don't forget the pants.

10:35.916 --> 10:38.450
♪ Cannot sleep in my pants

10:38.485 --> 10:40.252
Jesus!

10:40.287 --> 10:42.521
When is the last time
you washed these bad boys, Hank?

10:42.556 --> 10:44.290
Huh? Or yourself,
for that matter.

10:44.324 --> 10:47.059
I think the nurses gave me
a sponge bath in the hospital.

10:47.093 --> 10:48.727
But I could have dreamed that.

10:48.762 --> 10:51.030
You need to get your shit together, man.

10:51.064 --> 10:52.798
How do you propose I do that, Charlie?

10:52.833 --> 10:55.868
And once I've gathered up
all my pretty little turds,

10:55.902 --> 10:57.263
what do you suggest I do with them?

10:57.270 --> 10:58.771
You've got Karen to think about.

10:58.805 --> 11:00.906
- And Becca.
- They're better off without me.

11:00.941 --> 11:02.241
The both of 'em.

11:02.275 --> 11:03.409
All I ever do is fuck their shit up.

11:03.443 --> 11:05.611
All I want to do is sleep.

11:05.645 --> 11:08.280
Sleep till I can sleep no more.

11:08.315 --> 11:11.550
And then make myself sleepy
all over again.

11:14.287 --> 11:16.922
Can I at least get your number?

11:16.957 --> 11:19.491
You know, your digits.
Can I get your digits?

11:19.526 --> 11:21.327
You like the way I say that?
Digits, like the kids?

11:21.361 --> 11:23.162
You're not used to hearing no, are you?

11:23.196 --> 11:24.763
Yes, I am.

11:24.798 --> 11:25.931
It's just usually
I could give a shit less.

11:25.966 --> 11:27.433
Tonight I do, for some reason.

11:29.769 --> 11:31.303
- Hank.
- Yes.

11:31.338 --> 11:33.439
I have a boyfriend.

11:33.473 --> 11:34.673
Of course, you do.

11:34.708 --> 11:36.141
How could you not?

11:36.176 --> 11:38.077
But I think if we put our heads together

11:38.111 --> 11:39.745
we can overcome such obstacles.

11:39.779 --> 11:42.014
I have faith in us.

11:42.048 --> 11:43.649
I got to bounce.

11:43.683 --> 11:46.085
It was nice to meet you.

11:46.119 --> 11:48.487
It was nice to meet you too.

11:48.521 --> 11:50.289
Good night.

11:50.323 --> 11:51.357
Good morning...

11:51.391 --> 11:53.559
Karen.

12:05.872 --> 12:10.542
- Karen...Karen.
- Leave the poor girl alone.

12:12.846 --> 12:15.347
What if she's the one?

12:15.382 --> 12:16.849
Oh, go on.

12:16.883 --> 12:18.550
You're just gonna end up hurting her.

12:18.585 --> 12:20.719
And who knows?

12:20.754 --> 12:22.488
She might even, you know...

12:22.522 --> 12:23.822
Ccchhh!

12:33.833 --> 12:36.468
3.5 baths, Hank.

12:36.503 --> 12:37.836
3.5.

12:37.871 --> 12:41.540
Seemed too far to go.

12:41.574 --> 12:43.375
- You're up early.
- Never went to bed.

12:43.410 --> 12:45.010
Of course not.

12:45.045 --> 12:48.213
I can't get drunk enough
anymore, Charlie.

12:48.248 --> 12:49.548
Speaking of which,

12:49.582 --> 12:50.903
we're out of alcoholic beverages.

12:50.917 --> 12:52.484
Come on.
Get in the car.

12:52.519 --> 12:54.086
- We'll get you some.
- Fuck you.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.055
You're my agent.
You go get me some.

12:56.089 --> 12:58.691
Get in the car!

12:58.725 --> 13:00.559
We're taking a field trip.

13:10.870 --> 13:12.938
Gaaaah!

13:12.973 --> 13:15.341
Dee-licious!

13:24.584 --> 13:26.118
Hey.

13:32.359 --> 13:34.727
That's a weird-looking
liquor store.

13:37.430 --> 13:40.399
Welcome aboard <i>Air Force69,</i> gentlemen.

13:40.433 --> 13:41.533
Well, thank you.

13:41.568 --> 13:43.402
Hank Moody!

13:43.436 --> 13:45.204
Oh, I must be really fucking drunk.

13:45.238 --> 13:46.505
Is that Atticus Fetch?

13:46.539 --> 13:50.509
Baudelaire, Bukowski, and Oscar Wilde

13:50.543 --> 13:53.746
all wrapped up into one
talented motherfucking writer.

13:53.780 --> 13:54.947
Respect.

13:54.981 --> 13:56.548
Remember that for my tombstone.

13:56.583 --> 13:58.350
You ready to take this journey with me?

13:58.385 --> 14:00.419
That depends.
Is this a domestic flight?

14:00.453 --> 14:02.888
I'm not sure I have
a valid passport. Do I?

14:02.922 --> 14:04.590
What's wrong with him?

14:04.624 --> 14:06.792
Uh, he's just
a little bit drunk right now.

14:06.826 --> 14:08.260
Which begs the question:

14:08.294 --> 14:13.065
Why am I not
a little bit drunk right now?

14:13.099 --> 14:14.233
Do you know what that is?

14:14.267 --> 14:15.467
Is that <i>Black Hawk Down?</i>

14:15.502 --> 14:16.869
That's the Sudan.

14:16.903 --> 14:18.604
It's my own private satellite feed.

14:18.638 --> 14:20.973
If I witness a crime against humanity,

14:21.007 --> 14:23.909
I just pick up the phone
and report it.

14:23.943 --> 14:25.044
Or I can write a song about it.

14:25.078 --> 14:27.146
All this means precious little

14:27.180 --> 14:30.883
when you've watched a government
bomb its own civilians.

14:30.917 --> 14:32.651
Do you know why you're here, Hank?

14:32.685 --> 14:35.754
Oh, I don't even know why
I'm alive right now.

14:35.789 --> 14:37.589
<i>Crazy Little Thing Called Love</i>

14:37.624 --> 14:39.558
is my wife's favorite movie.

14:39.592 --> 14:42.327
Yeah, well, I'm sorry to hear that.

14:48.802 --> 14:50.282
Apologies, darling, but I don't think

14:50.303 --> 14:51.837
I'm gonna be able to come right now.

14:51.871 --> 14:53.338
It's nothing to do with you.

14:53.373 --> 14:55.607
I'm just really excited
about meeting this man.

14:55.642 --> 14:57.242
Oh, thank you, Atticus.

14:57.277 --> 14:59.411
It was an honor and a privilege
to hold your penis

14:59.446 --> 15:00.479
for as long as I did.

15:00.513 --> 15:03.315
You're welcome, pumpkin.

15:04.684 --> 15:06.585
Ooh!

15:06.619 --> 15:08.787
Personally, I hate the fucking thing.

15:11.624 --> 15:15.360
I think it's a huge piece of
mainstream Hollywood bullshit.

15:15.395 --> 15:17.529
♪ My old lady

15:17.564 --> 15:18.864
♪ she loves it

15:18.898 --> 15:20.999
♪ she fucking loves it

15:21.034 --> 15:22.801
Well, what does she feel about handjobs?

15:22.836 --> 15:25.204
♪ Handjobs are different

15:25.238 --> 15:26.472
I don't think they are.

15:26.506 --> 15:28.340
♪ Handjobs don't count

15:28.374 --> 15:31.143
I think they do.

15:31.177 --> 15:34.313
♪ I beg to differ

15:34.347 --> 15:39.451
♪ I can see it
from both sides ♪

15:39.486 --> 15:42.988
♪ oh, yeah

15:43.022 --> 15:45.290
So I said, "If I'm gonna do this thing,

15:45.325 --> 15:47.826
get me the guy who wrote
the fucking book."

15:47.861 --> 15:49.528
And here I am.
Do what?

15:49.562 --> 15:51.163
<i>God Hates Us All.</i>

15:51.197 --> 15:53.165
I fucking loved it, man.

15:53.199 --> 15:55.134
That was when
it all came together for me.

15:55.168 --> 15:57.769
It was like God came down from heaven

15:57.804 --> 16:02.207
and laid his massive,
veiny ball sack on my face.

16:02.242 --> 16:03.775
And when he took it away,

16:03.810 --> 16:07.179
it left a stain in the form of an idea.

16:07.213 --> 16:09.114
Make it a rock opera!

16:09.149 --> 16:12.684
Like <i>Tommy</i> or <i>Hair</i>
or <i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

16:12.719 --> 16:14.286
I mean, if fucking Bono

16:14.320 --> 16:16.655
can do <i>Spider-Man</i>
the fucking musical,

16:16.689 --> 16:18.123
I think I can do this.

16:18.158 --> 16:20.058
Well, do what?

16:20.093 --> 16:22.494
<i>Crazy Little Thing Called Love.</i>

16:22.529 --> 16:24.830
Hank, they're turning it
into a Broadway musical.

16:24.864 --> 16:27.866
- Oh, that's a terrible idea.
- That's what I said!

16:27.901 --> 16:30.002
But you and me together,

16:30.036 --> 16:32.037
I reckon we could
do something cool with it.

16:32.071 --> 16:33.172
You write the script,

16:33.206 --> 16:34.840
I write the music and lyrics.

16:34.874 --> 16:37.376
Let's make a fucking masterpiece, man!

16:37.410 --> 16:39.645
About--about love.

16:39.679 --> 16:41.647
Because love is all you need.

16:41.681 --> 16:43.849
All the world's problems

16:43.883 --> 16:47.753
eventually come
face-to-face with love.

16:47.787 --> 16:51.723
And who do you reckon wins?

16:51.758 --> 16:53.325
Love!

16:53.359 --> 16:54.526
It's fucking over, man!

16:54.561 --> 16:56.361
Love conquers all!
What do you say?

16:56.396 --> 16:57.729
I don't think so.

16:57.764 --> 17:00.399
- Think about it.
- Thought about it.

17:00.433 --> 17:02.834
But you're an admirer
of my work, as I am of yours.

17:02.869 --> 17:04.569
Not particularly, no.

17:04.604 --> 17:06.338
Really.

17:06.372 --> 17:08.507
They told me that you're a huge fan.

17:08.540 --> 17:10.175
Oh, <i>they</i> misspoke.

17:10.210 --> 17:12.944
And, uh...

17:12.979 --> 17:15.580
Why are you not a fan?

17:15.615 --> 17:18.083
Uh, you're smug, you're pompous.

17:18.117 --> 17:20.419
There's no cock in your rock anymore.

17:20.453 --> 17:22.387
You're a fucking dinosaur, man.

17:22.422 --> 17:24.423
Jesus!
Fuck you!

17:24.457 --> 17:25.457
Fuck you.
You asked.

17:25.491 --> 17:26.758
Fuck you!

17:26.792 --> 17:27.826
Ooh!

17:30.129 --> 17:32.965
Aah!

17:32.999 --> 17:34.466
Ooh.

17:48.848 --> 17:50.449
Becca!

17:52.318 --> 17:54.753
A bar is no place for a young lady.

17:54.787 --> 17:57.122
I agree.

17:57.156 --> 18:00.492
But here I am.
Happy day.

18:00.526 --> 18:01.893
Pull up a seat.

18:01.928 --> 18:03.462
I'll get you a sarsaparilla.

18:03.496 --> 18:05.664
Barkeep, sarsaparilla.

18:07.133 --> 18:08.967
Look, dad...

18:09.002 --> 18:10.969
I know you're going through
a very tough time right now.

18:11.004 --> 18:12.638
But you've got us all worried.

18:12.672 --> 18:14.273
Why doesn't anybody understand

18:14.307 --> 18:15.641
that I don't want
to talk about this shit.

18:15.675 --> 18:18.744
Okay, let's talk about me, then.

18:18.778 --> 18:21.280
I've got some good news,

18:21.314 --> 18:22.781
and some...great news.

18:22.815 --> 18:25.684
Tyler stepped in front of a bus

18:25.718 --> 18:28.487
and his corpse was brutally
raped by hipster zombies?

18:28.521 --> 18:30.455
Tyler and I broke up.

18:30.490 --> 18:31.523
Yes!

18:31.557 --> 18:33.492
Oh, mm. Really?

18:33.526 --> 18:34.860
When was that?

18:34.894 --> 18:35.927
Where the fuck was I?

18:35.962 --> 18:37.162
In the hospital.

18:37.196 --> 18:39.164
Then you went home and got drunk.

18:39.198 --> 18:41.199
Oh, yeah.

18:41.234 --> 18:42.801
For a month.

18:42.835 --> 18:46.271
Okay, yeah, I remember now.

18:46.306 --> 18:47.973
How, uh--
how are you with that?

18:48.007 --> 18:49.675
I'm fine.

18:49.709 --> 18:51.109
I thought it was love.

18:51.144 --> 18:52.444
Turns out it was lust.

18:52.478 --> 18:54.813
Ohh...

18:54.847 --> 18:57.316
I have a feeling that will
happen over and over again,

18:57.350 --> 18:58.784
until something sticks.

18:58.818 --> 19:00.986
Sweetheart, you are...

19:01.020 --> 19:03.855
wise and beautiful beyond your years...

19:03.890 --> 19:05.991
and deserving of a far better father

19:06.025 --> 19:08.493
than the barstool prophet
that sits beside you.

19:08.528 --> 19:09.995
I know.

19:10.029 --> 19:12.898
Point is, I grieved and I moved on.

19:12.932 --> 19:15.300
- Take a lesson.
- Oh.

19:15.335 --> 19:17.803
Thanks, coach.

19:17.837 --> 19:19.905
So, what's your news?

19:19.939 --> 19:22.741
Well, I'm about
to save you a shitload of money.

19:22.775 --> 19:23.875
Hmm?

19:23.910 --> 19:25.644
I'm dropping out of school.

19:25.678 --> 19:27.746
Oh, no, you're not.

19:27.780 --> 19:30.315
And here comes the great news.

19:30.350 --> 19:31.850
I want to be a writer.

19:31.884 --> 19:33.085
Why?

19:33.119 --> 19:34.686
Being a writer sucks.

19:34.721 --> 19:36.322
Everything I've been through in my life

19:36.356 --> 19:38.023
has led me to this.

19:38.057 --> 19:40.692
For better or worse,
I'm my father's daughter.

19:40.727 --> 19:43.428
I want to start living out loud.

19:43.463 --> 19:46.231
Laughing, loving, drinking, fucking.

19:46.265 --> 19:47.532
And I want to start writing about it.

19:47.567 --> 19:48.567
Uh...

19:48.601 --> 19:49.835
All of it.

19:49.869 --> 19:52.037
No, no.
Who are you right now?

19:52.071 --> 19:54.206
I really thought you'd be more supportive.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.340
You dropped out of college.

19:55.375 --> 19:56.875
Yeah, like, six times.

19:56.909 --> 19:59.010
And look at me.
I'm a fucking disaster-piece.

19:59.045 --> 20:01.046
I don't care what you say.
I'm still doing it.

20:01.080 --> 20:03.682
- Yeah, no, you're not, Becca.
- Why?

20:03.716 --> 20:05.250
Because I'm
your fucking father, that's why.

20:05.284 --> 20:06.852
You're funny.
Some father.

20:06.886 --> 20:09.654
Jesus Christ, Becca.
Have some fucking respect.

20:09.689 --> 20:11.056
Hey, everything okay over here?

20:11.090 --> 20:13.225
Fuck off, barkeep. Go.

20:13.259 --> 20:14.593
Hank, I'm warning you.

20:14.627 --> 20:16.895
- You all right, sweetie?
- Mind your own--

20:16.929 --> 20:18.063
You want me
to call somebody or something?

20:18.097 --> 20:19.164
I warned you, Hank.

20:19.198 --> 20:20.365
Uhh!

20:20.400 --> 20:22.033
Sorry, honey.

20:22.068 --> 20:23.869
He'll live to waste another day.

20:23.903 --> 20:25.904
There goes your tip.

20:25.938 --> 20:29.841
Well, I, for one,
really loved your book, Ophelia.

20:29.876 --> 20:32.611
Your shit really speaks to me.

20:32.645 --> 20:34.546
You know, all my life,
I've defined myself

20:34.580 --> 20:36.882
by whatever idiot man-child

20:36.916 --> 20:39.584
I was spreading my legs for at the time.

20:39.619 --> 20:43.021
And no more, I tell you, no more.

20:43.055 --> 20:44.589
Good for you, Marcy.

20:44.624 --> 20:45.957
You're exactly right.

20:45.992 --> 20:48.860
You don't need a man to be happy.

20:48.895 --> 20:51.029
- I'm living proof.
- See?

20:51.063 --> 20:52.964
That's what this skinny bitch

20:52.999 --> 20:54.399
has to get through her thick skull.

20:54.434 --> 20:56.067
That's really sweet of you, honey.

20:56.102 --> 20:58.904
But I don't think that men
are entirely to blame.

20:58.938 --> 21:00.305
Oh, they are, Karen.

21:00.339 --> 21:03.108
My entire thesis is built on this idea.

21:03.142 --> 21:05.377
Men are wild animals.

21:05.411 --> 21:07.446
And they must be regarded as such.

21:07.480 --> 21:08.947
Mm.

21:08.981 --> 21:11.283
I think that's a tad hysterical.

21:11.317 --> 21:12.818
Karen! Karen!

21:12.852 --> 21:15.253
I need you to dress this wound.

21:15.288 --> 21:16.721
What happened to him?
What happened?

21:16.756 --> 21:18.256
I'd like a drink.
Now would be good.

21:18.291 --> 21:20.592
No time like the present,
you know.

21:20.626 --> 21:22.828
- Oh.
- Oh, for God's sake.

21:22.862 --> 21:24.996
- I'm sorry.
- What is this stuff?

21:25.031 --> 21:26.932
The fucking <i>Vagina Dialogues?</i>

21:26.966 --> 21:28.333
Oh!

21:40.112 --> 21:41.947
Oh, shit.

21:41.981 --> 21:43.949
This better not be an intervention.

21:43.983 --> 21:45.917
Yes, Hank, it is.

21:45.952 --> 21:47.819
But it's also an act of love.

21:47.854 --> 21:49.821
But this is not about abstaining.

21:49.856 --> 21:51.256
Exactly.

21:51.290 --> 21:52.491
This is about you finding your way back

21:52.525 --> 21:54.292
to being the functional alcoholic

21:54.327 --> 21:55.293
that we all know and love.

21:55.328 --> 21:56.995
We miss that guy, Hanky.

21:57.029 --> 21:58.129
It's true, dad.

21:58.164 --> 21:59.931
You used to be such a good drunk.

21:59.966 --> 22:01.500
Now you're just disgusting.

22:01.534 --> 22:03.301
And bloated.

22:03.336 --> 22:05.470
And smelly.

22:05.505 --> 22:07.305
Well, thanks for that, daughter.

22:07.340 --> 22:08.607
It has to end.

22:08.641 --> 22:11.009
Think of it as a vacation, Hank.

22:11.043 --> 22:12.344
Hey, hey, get this.

22:12.378 --> 22:14.112
The place is called Happy Endings.

22:14.146 --> 22:15.814
You know, I think I could
use a stay there myself.

22:15.848 --> 22:17.315
The Internet porn thing
is really starting

22:17.350 --> 22:18.483
to suck me back in.

22:18.518 --> 22:20.919
Have you seen this tubegalore?

22:20.953 --> 22:22.521
Have you experienced this?

22:22.555 --> 22:24.489
It is a vortex, Hank.

22:24.524 --> 22:27.092
A swirling, black cauldron of sexuality.

22:27.126 --> 22:29.160
I sat down at the computer,
the other morning,

22:29.195 --> 22:31.630
I typed in "amateur bbw."

22:31.664 --> 22:33.164
And the next thing you know,
it's dinnertime.

22:33.199 --> 22:34.533
- Oh.
- What?

22:34.567 --> 22:37.335
- Ew!
- What? I'm being truthful!

22:37.370 --> 22:39.905
I can't believe
I ever shared a bed with you.

22:39.939 --> 22:43.174
Then I can't believe you're
going on your second ex-husband.

22:43.209 --> 22:46.244
Oh, and I really can't believe
you're back to renting.

22:46.279 --> 22:48.013
That's mean, Charlie.

22:48.047 --> 22:49.581
Do you want to see me cry?
Because this is me crying.

22:49.615 --> 22:51.449
Good God, woman!

22:51.484 --> 22:53.518
This is not about the petty
problems of L.A.'s working rich!

22:53.553 --> 22:56.688
This is about Hank and
his debilitating self-hatred!

22:56.722 --> 22:58.957
Exactly. And if Hank hadn't
been such a dick-in-the-mud,

22:58.991 --> 23:00.959
then he and Karen
would still be together,

23:00.993 --> 23:03.261
which means that Karen
and I wouldn't be a couple

23:03.296 --> 23:06.831
of pathetic 40-something
roommates right now!

23:06.866 --> 23:09.501
I thought you loved being my roommate.

23:09.535 --> 23:10.969
I do, baby.

23:11.003 --> 23:12.938
But I like my big,
shiny house in the hills

23:12.972 --> 23:14.539
just a wee bit better.

23:14.574 --> 23:16.808
But no, Stu had to go
and get his cock worshipped

23:16.842 --> 23:18.610
by that stupid little

23:18.644 --> 23:21.780
no-talent Mary Poppins
fucking cum-dumpster!

23:21.814 --> 23:24.783
Sorry, Becca, man.

23:24.817 --> 23:25.984
Whatever.

23:26.018 --> 23:27.552
Can we get back to dad?

23:27.587 --> 23:30.021
Oh! Maybe I should just
forgive and forget, right?

23:30.056 --> 23:31.122
I mean, it was just a blowjob.

23:31.157 --> 23:32.891
Blowjobs are like fist bumps.

23:32.925 --> 23:34.392
You know, I can forgive him
and move back

23:34.427 --> 23:35.994
into that big, beautiful house
in the Hills,

23:36.028 --> 23:37.696
and Stu and I could go to therapy.

23:37.730 --> 23:38.970
I mean, that's what couples do.

23:38.998 --> 23:40.165
They work their shit out
together, right?

23:40.199 --> 23:41.967
- No. No.
- What do you think?

23:42.001 --> 23:44.569
Thanks for the support, you
mean-spirited fucking gazelle!

23:44.604 --> 23:47.038
Why are you being
such a bitch right now?

23:47.073 --> 23:49.007
I don't know!
I'm sorry!

23:49.041 --> 23:51.977
Worst intervention ever.

23:52.011 --> 23:55.714
Okay, long story short, Hank, okay.

23:55.748 --> 23:57.382
You got to get your ass to rehab.

23:57.416 --> 24:00.051
If I could do it, you could do it.

24:00.086 --> 24:02.053
And I had the fucking yayo
to contend with.

24:02.088 --> 24:04.255
You just got the bottle.
♪ Pussy!

24:04.290 --> 24:06.925
Fuck you, Cunty Smurf.

24:06.959 --> 24:08.660
And while I'm at it,

24:08.694 --> 24:10.395
fuck all y'all
narcissistic motherfuckers.

24:10.429 --> 24:12.097
Except you, Becca.
I love you a long time.

24:12.131 --> 24:13.765
But this dropping
out of school business,

24:13.799 --> 24:15.066
- that's bullshit.
- What?

24:15.101 --> 24:16.534
What are you talking about?

24:19.071 --> 24:20.505
I didn't want to do this, Hank,

24:20.539 --> 24:22.407
but you give me no choice.

24:25.778 --> 24:27.545
I took a bullet for you, man.

24:27.580 --> 24:30.081
The least you can do
is try to heal yourself.

24:30.116 --> 24:32.250
For me, okay?

24:36.489 --> 24:39.057
Dad, these people
are borderline retarded,

24:39.091 --> 24:41.259
but they love you.
I love you.

24:41.293 --> 24:44.362
Get your head out of your ass
and stop drinking.

24:44.397 --> 24:48.299
'Cause sooner or later,
you're just gonna kill yourself.

24:48.334 --> 24:50.402
Just because I'm older now

24:50.436 --> 24:54.606
doesn't mean I don't need a father.

25:11.090 --> 25:12.791
Hey.

25:12.825 --> 25:16.928
You know, you didn't even
let me say my piece.

25:16.962 --> 25:19.264
How supremely shitty of me.

25:19.298 --> 25:21.066
What do you got?
Lay it on me, woman.

25:21.100 --> 25:23.268
We were in such
a great place that night.

25:23.302 --> 25:26.304
And if we stand any chance
of getting back there,

25:26.338 --> 25:30.308
you have to pull your shit together.

25:30.342 --> 25:31.743
And that's it.

25:31.777 --> 25:34.312
That's all I got.

25:34.346 --> 25:36.948
The rest is up to you.

25:36.982 --> 25:38.116
Can I tell you something?

25:38.150 --> 25:40.251
Yes, always.

25:40.286 --> 25:42.520
Even if it has the potential
to make you sad?

25:42.555 --> 25:46.491
Even better.

25:46.525 --> 25:49.127
That night, I was so looking forward

25:49.161 --> 25:50.161
to having dinner with you.

25:50.196 --> 25:53.098
For the first time in forever,

25:53.132 --> 25:55.867
you and me, we just seemed so possible.

25:55.901 --> 26:00.305
Everything I always wanted
just right around the corner.

26:00.339 --> 26:02.307
And then it all just went away.

26:02.341 --> 26:04.442
I was the last person to hurt her.

26:04.477 --> 26:06.277
To break her heart.

26:06.312 --> 26:08.680
And I can't put into words
how bad that makes me feel.

26:08.714 --> 26:10.782
And now it hurts to be awake,

26:10.816 --> 26:13.551
and I don't know if I can get
back to that feeling...

26:13.586 --> 26:15.854
with you.

26:15.888 --> 26:20.759
And what scares me is, um,
I'm not sure that I ever will.

26:22.895 --> 26:24.863
You will get back there.

26:24.897 --> 26:27.098
If you want to.

26:30.536 --> 26:32.036
And in the meantime,

26:32.071 --> 26:36.841
maybe I'll just dream
for both of us, I guess.

26:44.350 --> 26:46.417
Good night, Karen.

27:11.577 --> 27:13.444
Hey, Bukowski!

27:13.479 --> 27:16.281
It's freezing out there.
Come up.

27:16.315 --> 27:18.082
I'll make you some coffee.

27:18.117 --> 27:21.719
Hey,  I feel I should tell you

27:21.754 --> 27:23.221
that...

27:23.255 --> 27:24.589
