WEBVTT

00:00.906 --> 00:03.744
Bunny, I'm so excited
you finally decided to visit.

00:03.869 --> 00:05.797
Well, we always said
if we were both single, right?

00:06.250 --> 00:08.682
Right. I mean, we were
two ships passing in the night.

00:08.807 --> 00:09.850
You always had your boyfriend,

00:09.975 --> 00:10.951
I was always, you know, busy.

00:11.076 --> 00:12.846
As I told you,
I'm a very busy person.

00:13.012 --> 00:15.488
But now we're at
the same harbor, huh?

00:15.613 --> 00:16.822
I can hear the waves crashing.

00:16.947 --> 00:18.891
I thought I just heard a foghorn.

00:20.017 --> 00:21.694
I smell fish.

00:21.819 --> 00:23.363
I mean, not...not on you.

00:23.488 --> 00:25.398
I don't even smell fish.
I made that...I'm sorry.

00:25.523 --> 00:26.999
Um...

00:27.124 --> 00:28.401
And, um...

00:28.526 --> 00:30.236
I don't know where
these horses came from,

00:30.361 --> 00:31.448
but those are horses.

00:31.695 --> 00:36.442
So... right here we got
the, uh, breakfast foyer,

00:36.567 --> 00:39.744
and, um, the entertainment
center, of course,

00:39.869 --> 00:43.148
and, uh, balloons, I guess.

00:43.273 --> 00:45.350
It looks like rubber gloves
and condoms.

00:45.475 --> 00:46.818
Yeah, no, they are.

00:46.943 --> 00:50.788
Um, probably just my roommates'
way of saying welcome to you,

00:50.913 --> 00:52.056
'cause they're funny,

00:52.181 --> 00:53.458
and we're never gonna
meet them together,

00:53.583 --> 00:54.892
'cause I don't want you to.

00:55.017 --> 00:58.308
Well, why don't we take
this tour to your bedroom?

00:58.474 --> 01:01.061
I'm not saying I'm
gonna be rusty, but...

01:01.227 --> 01:02.567
Hey, Ders.

01:02.692 --> 01:04.134
You want a... you want a haircut?

01:04.259 --> 01:06.065
I'm like a shear genius
with these scissors.

01:06.190 --> 01:07.234
Why is this happening?

01:07.400 --> 01:10.974
Karl's getting married.
We're losing a dude.

01:15.825 --> 01:19.746
<font color="#3399FF">Sync and correction by Mlmlte</font>
<font color="#3399FF">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:27.837 --> 01:30.048
We're not having a wedding
in this house ever.

01:30.214 --> 01:32.794
Well, Ders, I wish you
would've brought it up earlier

01:32.919 --> 01:34.636
because it's in, like, five hours,

01:34.802 --> 01:37.264
and we sent a "save the dates"
out yesterday.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.432
Did you not get it?

01:38.598 --> 01:41.969
No, you got it.
I slipped one under your door.

01:42.094 --> 01:43.228
Except that I didn't do that,

01:43.394 --> 01:44.539
because I forgot to do that,

01:44.664 --> 01:45.607
because I was eating Froot Loops.

01:45.732 --> 01:47.065
- Dang it.
- Our bad.

01:47.231 --> 01:48.510
Come on, Ders, Hannah's amazing.

01:48.635 --> 01:49.484
I'm changing for her.

01:49.650 --> 01:51.045
Yep, uh, he's definitely changing.

01:51.170 --> 01:52.912
He sold the rape van,
and he quit selling weed,

01:53.037 --> 01:54.281
- which is...
- Yeah, how stupid.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.074
- A life decision.
- Yeah, that's dumb.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.993
Yeah, and I got glasses
to fix the wonky eye.

01:58.159 --> 01:59.686
- Can you put 'em on me?
- Yep, mm-hmm.

01:59.811 --> 02:00.620
- Nice.
- Check that out.

02:00.786 --> 02:02.088
Check it out.
Wonk gone.

02:02.213 --> 02:05.417
Come on.
Weddings.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.627
No, uh, they're gonna go,
and we're gonna...

02:07.752 --> 02:11.330
No, we've got to help.

02:11.455 --> 02:13.258
How can we help you guys?

02:13.424 --> 02:14.926
Are you sure our neighbors won't mind?

02:15.225 --> 02:16.935
Oh, no. We steal stuff
from 'em all the time.

02:17.060 --> 02:18.930
Bikes, lemons, internet.
Yeah.

02:19.096 --> 02:21.224
Garden weasel weaseling over. Whoa.

02:21.390 --> 02:22.575
Careful.

02:22.700 --> 02:25.310
Ah!
One down, one down.

02:25.435 --> 02:27.279
I think it's really cool
you and Ders had a pact

02:27.404 --> 02:29.441
that if you're ever single,
you guys bone each other.

02:29.607 --> 02:30.848
Did you tell them?

02:30.973 --> 02:32.611
No, I never used the word "bone".

02:32.777 --> 02:34.029
He said, "bone."

02:34.477 --> 02:36.573
Anyway, we're gonna be
over here, guys.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.256
You know, I used to have
a marriage pact.

02:38.381 --> 02:39.290
- That's cool.
- It's true.

02:39.415 --> 02:41.024
I was 16, she was 11.

02:41.149 --> 02:43.327
She acted really old, though.
She acted like...

02:43.452 --> 02:44.956
- 13 at least.
- That's old.

02:45.122 --> 02:46.166
I was gonna wait for her,

02:46.332 --> 02:48.499
but then girls in my grade
started to develop,

02:48.624 --> 02:49.633
so I sort of went that way.

02:49.758 --> 02:51.602
- I wonder how old she is now.
- Boobs rule.

02:51.879 --> 02:52.869
Oh, my goodness.

02:52.994 --> 02:55.133
Tell me these are the
arrangements for the wedding.

02:55.299 --> 02:58.011
Thank you, thank you,
this is awesome.

02:58.177 --> 02:59.375
Blake, before I forget,
I really just wanted

02:59.500 --> 03:00.776
to give you this.

03:00.901 --> 03:03.079
It's a token of my appreciation

03:03.349 --> 03:04.914
for you being the best best man

03:05.039 --> 03:06.048
in the entire universe.

03:06.173 --> 03:07.149
- Gas masks.
- Yeah.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.605
Is that an antique Zong?

03:08.771 --> 03:09.719
- Yeah.
- This is old school.

03:09.844 --> 03:11.553
And all your slammers?
Very cool.

03:11.678 --> 03:13.088
All of my slammers, everything.

03:13.213 --> 03:14.194
Why are you giving this all to me?

03:14.360 --> 03:15.153
I'm moving on.

03:15.382 --> 03:17.459
That was me, and this is me.

03:17.738 --> 03:20.795
Adam, I'd think about
cutting down on the smoking.

03:20.920 --> 03:21.827
Oh, that isn't weed.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.578
But this is your favorite stuff.

03:23.744 --> 03:25.601
Blake, it's like
"Shakesbeers" once penned:

03:25.726 --> 03:27.749
"If you love a girl,
and you love her a lot,

03:28.394 --> 03:31.606
"then it's your responsibility...
nay, your duty...

03:31.731 --> 03:35.924
To change completely to be
more similar doth that girl."

03:36.090 --> 03:37.676
Yeah, doth... doth must change.

03:37.842 --> 03:38.802
I am changing.

03:38.968 --> 03:39.980
Shakespeare was a smart dude.

03:40.105 --> 03:42.138
- He was the president of Rome.
- That is correct.

03:42.304 --> 03:43.390
- Is this tear gas?
- Yeah.

03:43.556 --> 03:44.975
I caught that up
in a riot in Seattle.

03:45.141 --> 03:46.309
I thought you'd like it.

03:46.475 --> 03:49.688
Adam, how are we doing
on the music for the ceremony?

03:49.854 --> 03:52.024
Well, I told you that I needed money

03:52.149 --> 03:53.149
if I was gonna get anyone good.

03:53.315 --> 03:54.494
So I haven't really...

03:54.619 --> 03:55.944
Plus it's not all about
you today, man.

03:56.220 --> 03:58.398
Look at me, I'm dateless.
You have love, I have nothing.

03:58.523 --> 03:59.398
I have nothing in my life.

03:59.523 --> 04:01.257
I'm an unlovable, dateless loser.

04:01.782 --> 04:04.236
Okay, so here is my
entire life savings

04:04.361 --> 04:05.771
in $100 bills.

04:05.896 --> 04:06.872
I give it to you so that you

04:06.997 --> 04:09.198
can get a band that is very classy.

04:09.623 --> 04:11.377
I'm thinking Primus or Green Day.

04:11.502 --> 04:13.312
Them or Jakob Dylan.

04:13.437 --> 04:14.379
Did you just say, "Jakob Dylan"?

04:14.545 --> 04:15.505
Wallflowers' Jakob Dylan?

04:15.671 --> 04:16.748
That Jakob Dylan.

04:16.873 --> 04:19.149
I know what I have to do.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.918
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Was that...

04:22.043 --> 04:23.755
Hyah!
That's a stopping sound.

04:23.880 --> 04:24.848
Good work.

04:28.851 --> 04:30.979
Guess who came back for you.

04:31.145 --> 04:34.531
Oh, yeah.
We're done.

04:34.656 --> 04:35.799
We're done.
Nice job.

04:35.924 --> 04:37.934
What do you say we hit the sack?

04:38.059 --> 04:39.235
- Anders.
- Come on.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.672
- You said we would help.
- Okay, I-I'm sorry.

04:41.797 --> 04:43.774
I'm not being sensitive,
you're probably not in the mood,

04:43.899 --> 04:45.442
we're out here sweating
under the hot sun.

04:45.567 --> 04:47.579
Give me your hands.
Let's play a game.

04:47.745 --> 04:51.333
It's called "how close can you
get to me without kissing me?"

04:54.942 --> 04:56.719
- This close.
- Uh-oh.

04:56.844 --> 04:59.049
- Come on. Jesus!
- Looks like love is in the air.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.759
Scared the hell out of me, man.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.325
Oh, my gosh.
These are looking great.

05:02.450 --> 05:04.158
Bunny, you're doing an excellent job.

05:04.283 --> 05:06.060
- Those look beautiful.
- Thank you.

05:06.185 --> 05:08.730
Uh, Anders, if you could
do me a favor

05:08.855 --> 05:10.298
and put the red ones to the outside,

05:10.423 --> 05:11.833
and the white ones on the inside,

05:11.958 --> 05:12.867
that'd be much appreciated.

05:12.992 --> 05:14.856
It's just a tad bit classier.

05:15.022 --> 05:16.471
So you want this to be classier?

05:16.596 --> 05:17.525
Yeah.

05:17.691 --> 05:19.861
None of this is gonna be classy,

05:20.027 --> 05:21.279
because it's your wedding,

05:21.445 --> 05:24.034
and you're dirty brown water trash.

05:24.323 --> 05:29.579
And you're always going to be
dirty brown water trash.

05:34.179 --> 05:35.621
Why are you so mean to him?

05:35.746 --> 05:37.170
He seems like a total sweetheart.

05:37.336 --> 05:39.058
He seems?
You don't know him, okay?

05:39.183 --> 05:40.793
This is the guy who borrows

05:40.918 --> 05:43.496
my VHS autographed copy of <i>D.A.R.Y.L,</i>

05:43.621 --> 05:45.887
- and then never returns it.
- I'm sorry, who is Daryl?

05:46.053 --> 05:47.667
What's <i>D.A.R.Y.L.?</i>
<i>D.A.R.Y.L</i> is a movie.

05:47.792 --> 05:50.470
It's, like, the best movie
ever made about an android boy

05:50.595 --> 05:52.371
that, like, just wanted
to be a real human child,

05:52.496 --> 05:53.436
but didn't know...

05:53.697 --> 05:54.729
Well, it sounds awful.

05:54.895 --> 05:57.743
- Yeah.
- No, the movie.

05:57.868 --> 05:59.110
The movie's great.

05:59.235 --> 06:01.778
You're thinking of <i>a.I.,</i>
which was still pretty good.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.549
I was 16, you were 11.

06:04.674 --> 06:06.658
My mom paid you to help me
with my math.

06:06.824 --> 06:07.826
What are you doing here?

06:07.992 --> 06:09.353
I'm a rich dude now,

06:09.478 --> 06:11.622
and I came to proclaim my love.

06:11.747 --> 06:12.789
So look at the top hat,

06:13.048 --> 06:15.750
and also the $70 dress
that I got you,

06:15.916 --> 06:19.430
$22 in flowers, $66 in jelly beans.

06:19.555 --> 06:21.766
Is that buttered popcorn?

06:21.891 --> 06:24.667
Yeah, it is. Your favorite.
And I remember that.

06:24.792 --> 06:27.220
And that's not scary
that I remembered it at all.

06:27.386 --> 06:28.471
What is this for?

06:28.762 --> 06:30.139
We were already
supposed to be tongue-deep

06:30.264 --> 06:32.141
in each other by now,
so this is awkward.

06:32.266 --> 06:35.244
You forgot about
our marriage pact, didn't you?

06:35.369 --> 06:37.647
Yeah, 'cause you said
that when you were 18,

06:37.772 --> 06:40.181
that we would get married
under the moonlit sky,

06:40.306 --> 06:41.735
and I would buy you apple pucker,

06:41.901 --> 06:44.029
and we would both drink it
into the night.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.487
But I'm not ready for that right now,

06:45.612 --> 06:47.157
so put it back in your pants, okay?

06:47.323 --> 06:49.758
I'm just looking for a date
to my drug dealer's wedding,

06:49.883 --> 06:52.060
and quite frankly,
you developed into...

06:52.185 --> 06:54.596
Just a real sexy broad.

06:54.721 --> 06:58.033
Those...those are some
real classy dogs up top.

06:58.158 --> 07:00.068
- They're barking at me.
- I'm Melissa's father.

07:00.193 --> 07:02.380
Can I help you?

07:02.546 --> 07:06.051
♪ ♪

07:12.223 --> 07:14.391
So...

07:14.516 --> 07:16.644
I was thinking
for the dinner beverage,

07:16.810 --> 07:20.148
we have a four loko watermelon
from '09.

07:20.314 --> 07:24.402
That's when it was still, like,
you know, the good stuff.

07:24.568 --> 07:25.868
Looks [Bleep] Stupid.

07:25.993 --> 07:28.571
Okay.
Talk to me.

07:28.696 --> 07:30.540
All right, man.

07:30.665 --> 07:33.078
Hannah's this fancy chick
who works at a credit union.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.243
D d me?

07:34.368 --> 07:37.582
I'm stupid, dumb,
ugly, brown water trash.

07:37.748 --> 07:38.792
Don't say that.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.415
Maybe I should just call it off.

07:40.540 --> 07:41.984
I'll stand by that decision.

07:42.109 --> 07:43.797
It's just that she makes me
so happy, you know?

07:43.963 --> 07:46.174
She lets me pork her
while she's sleeping.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.842
- Sleep assault?
- Yeah.

07:48.008 --> 07:49.594
- That's your favorite.
- I know.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.804
I mean, that's love.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.222
Now you know what I'm dealing with.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.595
I think I know what we're gonna do.

07:54.720 --> 07:55.892
We're gonna throw you

07:56.058 --> 08:01.369
the classiest,
bestest wedding that we can!

08:01.647 --> 08:04.104
I apologize for saying,
"Big-titted Freak Show."

08:04.229 --> 08:05.538
I will say that.

08:05.663 --> 08:07.440
But I have a marriage pact
with your daughter,

08:07.565 --> 08:11.345
and we love each other, so...

08:11.470 --> 08:12.242
Hi, dad.

08:12.504 --> 08:13.446
I lied to you, okay?

08:13.571 --> 08:15.411
I wasn't 11, I was 9.

08:15.577 --> 08:18.039
I'm 16 right now, not 18.

08:18.205 --> 08:19.219
Wow.

08:19.344 --> 08:20.686
I wasn't even attracted d to you.

08:20.811 --> 08:22.418
I just used you to get rid to the B.K.

08:22.584 --> 08:25.004
- I'm so sorry.
- Okay.

08:25.170 --> 08:26.792
You wouldn't happen
to have a connection

08:26.917 --> 08:29.134
with singer-songwriter
Jakob Dylan, would you?

08:29.300 --> 08:30.296
Shouldn't b be helping?

08:30.421 --> 08:31.597
There's still a lot
more flowers to do,

08:31.722 --> 08:33.099
and I know they need
more chairs outside.

08:33.224 --> 08:34.267
Well, they don't.
It will be fine.

08:34.392 --> 08:35.333
I want to give you
the rest of a that tour.

08:35.458 --> 08:36.400
Okay.

08:36.525 --> 08:38.270
Why does this
keep happening to me?

08:38.395 --> 08:39.504
Get out!

08:39.629 --> 08:40.605
Get out!
You get out!

08:40.730 --> 08:42.697
This is my room in my house.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.818
- No! I need that!
- Stop!

08:48.360 --> 08:50.405
- Oh!
- Okay.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.216
You just ruined the bride's dress.

08:52.489 --> 08:53.650
The sequins ruined the dress.

08:53.775 --> 08:54.785
I just spilled wine on it,

08:54.910 --> 08:56.536
and I'm not feeling
bad about it at all.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.555
You have some real problems.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.024
Yeah, I have some problems.

09:00.149 --> 09:01.425
One, two, three problems.

09:01.550 --> 09:02.542
I got 40 problems in the front yard,

09:02.708 --> 09:03.794
10 in the back yard.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.029
These are people
running around my house

09:05.154 --> 09:06.462
when I'm just trying
to buck my soul mate.

09:06.628 --> 09:07.505
Because that's the way
I feel about you.

09:07.671 --> 09:08.531
It's been so long and I feel like

09:08.656 --> 09:10.166
we got this connection going.

09:10.291 --> 09:13.303
But we can't do anything because
they're having this wedding!

09:13.594 --> 09:14.703
Look, I'm sorry.
Let me be honest.

09:14.828 --> 09:16.239
I just haven't bucked in,
like, a year and a half,

09:16.364 --> 09:17.273
and I'm trying to buck.

09:17.398 --> 09:18.892
Your butt cheeks
are driving me insane.

09:19.058 --> 09:19.842
Let me buck you.

09:19.967 --> 09:21.186
I don't do bucking.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.103
How's it going?

09:22.336 --> 09:23.946
Beverages in the back, help yourself.

09:24.071 --> 09:25.148
Good to see you.

09:25.405 --> 09:27.515
I do not know who they are.
Where are all your friends?

09:27.640 --> 09:30.361
These are, like,
real showered humans.

09:30.527 --> 09:32.254
No, they're all Hannah's
friends from the credit union.

09:32.379 --> 09:33.822
They had suits,
so I invited them, dude.

09:33.947 --> 09:35.490
I'm trying to class it up.

09:35.615 --> 09:37.692
I couldn't have Hannah
meeting all my scumbag friends.

09:37.817 --> 09:39.527
Except for sewer Dwayne, he's here.

09:39.652 --> 09:41.762
He's running around with, uh,
no shirt, overalls.

09:41.887 --> 09:42.763
- Nice.
- You seen him?

09:42.888 --> 09:43.833
Yeah, I know sewer Dwayne.

09:43.999 --> 09:45.532
Good, good, good, good, good guy.

09:45.657 --> 09:47.801
Hey, Ders.
We got any more chairs?

09:47.926 --> 09:49.172
I need some more chairs.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.174
Check the South side of the house!

09:54.032 --> 09:55.720
Never eat shredded...

09:55.886 --> 09:57.722
- Wheat.
- There we go.

09:59.971 --> 10:03.561
Sewer Dwayne, you dog.

10:05.521 --> 10:06.987
You don't have 40s.

10:07.112 --> 10:08.955
I...you know, I'll call
the cops on you.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.190
You threatening me?

10:10.315 --> 10:13.125
I'll call the...
I'll call the cops on you.

10:13.250 --> 10:14.526
Spare some change?

10:14.651 --> 10:16.795
How 'bout you spare me
your bad attitude, okay?

10:16.920 --> 10:18.030
I'm sick of girls

10:18.155 --> 10:20.265
thinking they can take
and take and take from me,

10:20.390 --> 10:24.582
'cause I'm done giving.

10:24.748 --> 10:28.139
A little slug for you,
a little slug for me.

10:28.264 --> 10:30.541
A little...what?
Oh, you're ignoring me now?

10:30.666 --> 10:32.743
Oh, 'cause you guys are.

10:32.868 --> 10:34.778
Do you need a hand?

10:34.903 --> 10:35.885
No, I'm good.
Thank you.

10:36.051 --> 10:37.348
Let me help.

10:37.473 --> 10:40.018
I feel bad for trying to mooch.

10:40.143 --> 10:43.587
O-okay.
Okay.

10:43.712 --> 10:45.489
Wow, you're being very pleasant.

10:45.614 --> 10:47.157
Most human girls are very mean to me.

10:47.282 --> 10:48.591
- No.
- Like, I'm more of a...

10:48.716 --> 10:50.593
I'm kind of an animal guy.
What are you doing?

10:50.718 --> 10:52.193
- Ow, stop it!
- Suck it, bitch!

10:52.359 --> 10:53.163
Give me back my malt liquor!

10:53.288 --> 10:54.737
You get back here!

10:57.325 --> 10:58.335
Give it!

10:58.615 --> 11:00.827
- Give it to me! You thief!
- No! No! No! No!

11:05.732 --> 11:07.417
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.446
Are you a size four?

11:10.571 --> 11:13.149
Blake, I'm getting real nervous, man.

11:13.274 --> 11:14.340
Hannah's not here yet.

11:14.506 --> 11:15.842
I'm about to have a cow, dude.

11:16.008 --> 11:19.053
Oh, Karl, come on.
You're gonna be fine, huh?

11:19.219 --> 11:20.955
She's the one, right?

11:21.221 --> 11:23.266
- She is. She's the one.
- Hey, baby.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.393
Hey!
There's my baby doll.

11:25.985 --> 11:28.953
Blake, I'd love for you
to meet Hannah.

11:29.354 --> 11:29.864
Hi.

11:29.989 --> 11:32.150
Hi.

11:38.655 --> 11:40.332
So, um, I should be getting ready.

11:40.457 --> 11:41.492
It was nice to meet you.

11:41.658 --> 11:42.910
- Yeah, I met you too.
- I'll see you guys.

11:43.126 --> 11:44.602
Do that, babe.
You look great already.

11:44.727 --> 11:45.570
Thank you.

11:45.695 --> 11:47.332
Isn't she just fucking classy?

11:47.564 --> 11:48.773
Well, yeah.

11:48.898 --> 11:50.675
Thank you.
Thank you.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.503
We should probably talk
about something, I'm thinking.

11:52.669 --> 11:54.964
Presenting...

11:55.130 --> 11:59.917
Mr. and Mrs. Adam "Kill Zone" Demamp.

12:00.042 --> 12:01.052
This is Rachel.

12:01.177 --> 12:02.954
She's hot as hell.
She's not homeless.

12:03.079 --> 12:04.222
We're gonna get fucked up, right?

12:04.347 --> 12:06.090
Yeah, we're gonna get
Up, definitely.

12:06.215 --> 12:07.560
- Whatever you want.
- Hey, Adam.

12:07.726 --> 12:08.978
- See you got a date there.
- Hey. Mm-hmm.

12:09.144 --> 12:10.146
Probably wondering where mine went.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.328
I'm not, really.

12:11.453 --> 12:13.029
We didn't even buck, and she left,

12:13.154 --> 12:14.525
and it's Karl's fault,
so I'm gonna make him pay.

12:14.691 --> 12:16.233
Yeah, definitely,
definitely, definitely.

12:16.358 --> 12:18.279
This is my date.
Her name is Rachel.

12:18.445 --> 12:20.436
She's never been homeless,
so scoreboard for me.

12:20.561 --> 12:21.872
- Hang on to her, man.
- Count that.

12:21.997 --> 12:23.173
- What have you got?
- It doesn't last forever.

12:23.298 --> 12:24.911
I got, uh, booze...

12:25.077 --> 12:27.766
Dude, I wanna take a
Header to the dome.

12:28.163 --> 12:31.459
Okay, uh, real drugs.
Not my cup o' tea.

12:31.705 --> 12:32.882
Where's your medicine cabinet?

12:33.007 --> 12:34.083
It's this way.

12:34.208 --> 12:35.550
Sometimes, I-I take a bunch of Ambien

12:35.675 --> 12:36.651
and see how long I can masturbate.

12:36.776 --> 12:37.799
You're such a pussy.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.454
So, uh, what were you...
what were you telling me?

12:39.579 --> 12:40.522
You had something to tell me?

12:40.647 --> 12:42.690
Uh...Yes, I did.
I did.

12:42.815 --> 12:44.592
- Uh, sewer Dwayne.
- Right.

12:44.717 --> 12:46.227
I caught him
munchin' buhzoombuhs like...

12:46.352 --> 12:47.695
Like cinnamon rolls, basically.

12:47.820 --> 12:50.064
Oh, my God.
Speaking of buhzoombuhs...

12:50.189 --> 12:50.937
Mommy!

12:51.103 --> 12:53.902
Oh!

12:54.027 --> 12:56.442
Blake, I'd love for you
to meet the best mommy

12:56.608 --> 12:59.672
in the entire universe, my mommy.

12:59.797 --> 13:01.239
Mommy, this is Blake.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.977
Miss Karl, hey, I wish it was
better circumstances.

13:04.102 --> 13:06.619
I'm joking.
And congratulations.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.648
This is gonna be fucking wild.

13:08.773 --> 13:10.039
Oh.

13:10.205 --> 13:12.685
You see,
today is the most special day

13:12.810 --> 13:13.876
of my entire existence,

13:14.042 --> 13:16.789
and I realize now that if
anything were to go wrong,

13:16.914 --> 13:19.966
I would probably just
Kill myself like my dad.

13:21.758 --> 13:23.362
Hey, Hannah, are you in there?

13:23.487 --> 13:24.887
- Hannah.
- What do you want?

13:25.053 --> 13:26.966
I just need to talk
to Hannah very, very...

13:27.091 --> 13:28.200
Okay, well, she's busy,

13:28.325 --> 13:29.835
and another guy already
ruined her dress, so...

13:29.960 --> 13:31.669
- Okay, I didn't do that.
- No boys allowed.

13:31.794 --> 13:34.355
But I...

13:34.597 --> 13:35.982
Okay.

13:39.001 --> 13:42.180
- So starchy.
- Need a hand there, partner?

13:42.305 --> 13:45.483
Uh, yeah, sure.
I appreciate it, braj.

13:45.608 --> 13:47.117
My pleasure.

13:47.242 --> 13:48.552
So you ready for the big day?

13:48.677 --> 13:49.553
Oh, a thousand times, "yes."

13:49.678 --> 13:51.221
- I love Hannah so much.
- Mm-hmm.

13:51.346 --> 13:52.689
She works at a credit union, man,

13:52.814 --> 13:54.325
she's really, really classy.

13:54.450 --> 13:55.725
Did I tell you that?

13:55.850 --> 13:57.336
You did.
Very cool.

13:57.752 --> 13:58.695
So what about you and bunny?

13:58.820 --> 14:01.298
You think there's a future there?

14:01.423 --> 14:03.166
Nope, not any more.

14:03.291 --> 14:05.268
Really? Why not?
She was cool.

14:05.393 --> 14:07.305
She sure was, but she's gone.

14:07.562 --> 14:10.639
And we never bucked, so...
What are you gonna do?

14:10.764 --> 14:12.275
I got my eye
on somebody else, though.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.178
- Nice.
- Yeah.

14:15.303 --> 14:17.036
Here we go.
Perfect.

14:17.439 --> 14:18.680
Now if you don't mind, Karl,

14:18.805 --> 14:23.885
I'm gonna go buck your mom.

14:24.010 --> 14:25.944
No!

14:27.000 --> 14:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:34.520 --> 14:36.497
Oh, my God.
Oh.

14:36.622 --> 14:38.711
This is delicious.

14:38.877 --> 14:41.202
It's a mixture of red wine,
pain-killers, cough syrup,

14:41.327 --> 14:42.769
and bath salts.

14:42.894 --> 14:44.008
A lot of bath salts.

14:44.174 --> 14:46.773
- Is that safe?
- Not for your brain.

14:46.898 --> 14:50.010
But it's the best high
we're gonna have tonight.

14:50.135 --> 14:51.724
Hello!

14:51.890 --> 14:54.268
Euphegenia Henderson, my dear.

14:54.434 --> 14:56.782
I'm the great-great-grandmother
of the bride.

14:56.907 --> 14:57.939
How is my lovely?

14:58.176 --> 14:59.524
I can see your face, idiot.

15:00.211 --> 15:02.155
Take off her dress,
and leave us alone.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.657
You're not funny.

15:04.782 --> 15:07.031
Hello!

15:07.197 --> 15:09.585
Hannah?

15:14.705 --> 15:17.449
Oh, you're wonderful.
Remember, I taught you?

15:17.574 --> 15:19.851
I do, I do. I know.
That was awesome.

15:21.294 --> 15:23.287
Ders, what are you doing?

15:23.412 --> 15:25.656
I'm just, uh, looking
for the hole in the ceiling,

15:25.781 --> 15:27.324
because I'm pretty sure
you fell from heaven.

15:27.449 --> 15:28.359
Hi, I'm Anders.

15:28.484 --> 15:30.561
Oh, wow, I like him.

15:30.686 --> 15:32.930
Mommy, this is Ders,
and Ders is evil,

15:33.055 --> 15:34.559
and he needs to leave.

15:34.725 --> 15:35.665
Karl, I'm not evil.

15:35.790 --> 15:38.368
Well, maybe I am.
I don't know.

15:38.493 --> 15:40.537
But seriously, I just wanted
to show you guys a few steps,

15:40.662 --> 15:42.305
a few moves that I know,
that could, you know,

15:42.430 --> 15:43.526
help you out tonight
on the dance floor.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.442
- Really?
- Mommy, no.

15:45.567 --> 15:47.778
First thing's first,
let's, uh, switch this beat up.

15:47.903 --> 15:50.013
Now we're talking.

15:50.138 --> 15:52.201
You bring the rhythm,
I'll bring the blues.

15:52.367 --> 15:54.996
Ooh.
Black music.

15:55.162 --> 15:58.253
Yes.

15:58.378 --> 15:59.522
You know, when I'm dancing,

15:59.647 --> 16:02.024
I like to see how close
I can get without kissing.

16:02.149 --> 16:04.964
I find it very erotic.

16:07.921 --> 16:11.433
But sometimes, you got to
save that...For later.

16:11.558 --> 16:13.167
Okay?

16:13.292 --> 16:17.839
So, uh, Karl, the bowtie, come on.

16:17.964 --> 16:22.444
I can do
anything I want with her.

16:22.569 --> 16:24.368
Okay?
Hey, great meeting you.

16:24.691 --> 16:27.028
- I'll see you out there?
- Lovely meeting you.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.614
Well, it's, uh, go time...

16:29.780 --> 16:34.869
Unless, uh, we're thinking
maybe we don't want a go time.

16:35.035 --> 16:37.057
Welcome, everyone, to the marriage

16:37.182 --> 16:39.516
of Karl Carlos hevacheck,

16:39.641 --> 16:41.792
and...Hannah.

16:42.352 --> 16:44.831
Well, let's just get right off
t-t-to the important stuff.

16:44.956 --> 16:46.714
Does anybody here have an objection?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.424
Does anybody object to the marriage?

16:48.590 --> 16:50.635
Speak now, forever hold your peace.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.219
Any objections?

16:52.385 --> 16:54.039
Oh! Ha-ha!
I knew it.

16:54.164 --> 16:55.765
Yes, sir, what's your object...

16:55.931 --> 16:58.267
No?
Well, you moved a little.

16:58.433 --> 16:59.978
- I think we're good, bro.
- Okay. All right.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.347
Last call, any objections?

17:02.472 --> 17:04.898
Yes, I have an objection.
Yep, that's right.

17:05.065 --> 17:09.220
I have an objection
because I saw this girl

17:09.345 --> 17:10.945
basically just getting the butter

17:11.363 --> 17:13.281
sucked out of her boobs
by sewer Dwayne.

17:13.448 --> 17:15.826
That's right.
Karl, I'm sorry.

17:15.951 --> 17:16.993
I had to tell you this

17:17.160 --> 17:18.829
because I'm just a really
good friend of yours,

17:18.994 --> 17:21.164
and you're changing
for all the wrong reasons.

17:21.289 --> 17:22.265
Okay, whatever.

17:22.390 --> 17:23.834
I was just trying
to piss my parents off

17:23.959 --> 17:25.301
by marrying water trash.

17:25.426 --> 17:27.337
And then you started
dressing all weird and...

17:27.503 --> 17:29.305
We were gonna have
a house in the suburbs,

17:29.430 --> 17:30.573
we were gonna have babies,

17:30.698 --> 17:33.344
and then those babies
were gonna suck on your titties.

17:33.510 --> 17:34.845
What the [Bleep] Is up
with your hair?

17:35.011 --> 17:36.445
- It's for you.
- It's stupid.

17:36.570 --> 17:38.982
It's classy.
It's like yours.

17:39.107 --> 17:42.519
Hannah, I might be water trash,

17:42.644 --> 17:44.647
but I'm also a water human.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.649
That doesn't even mean anything.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.725
Mommy, let's...

17:49.850 --> 17:51.278
Mommy?
Blake, where's mommy?

17:51.444 --> 17:52.427
- I...
- She's with Ders.

17:52.552 --> 17:53.614
Mommy! Mommy!

17:53.780 --> 17:55.700
Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy
mommy, mommy, mommy.

17:55.866 --> 17:56.732
I got it!

17:56.857 --> 17:59.734
I'll take care of it.

17:59.859 --> 18:00.801
Hey, gang.

18:00.926 --> 18:02.123
I know that we saw one love

18:02.289 --> 18:04.291
dissolve into oblivion.

18:04.457 --> 18:08.004
But did we see another love
blossom into fruitation?

18:08.170 --> 18:10.214
Can I have my
Drink back, please?

18:10.380 --> 18:12.914

No, Karl, I didn't buck mommy.

19:19.074 --> 19:21.644
For a second, I imagined having
a kid that was part you,

19:21.769 --> 19:23.903
and my dick went back inside my body.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.815
- Happy?
- Cool. Thank you.

19:25.940 --> 19:28.542

Thank you!

19:47.560 --> 19:48.938

19:55.101 --> 19:56.410

19:56.535 --> 19:58.312
Gonna grow my hair out again.

19:58.437 --> 19:59.947
Gonna get the rape van back somehow.

20:00.072 --> 20:02.415

20:02.540 --> 20:03.617

20:03.742 --> 20:06.053

20:06.178 --> 20:07.287
I really appreciate that.

20:07.412 --> 20:08.913
No way, man.

20:09.457 --> 20:10.724
- Cool.
- Yeah.

20:10.849 --> 20:12.259
Wait a second.
This isn't it.

20:12.384 --> 20:13.994
- It's <i>out of control.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

20:20.677 --> 20:22.334
Where's...where's my date?

20:22.459 --> 20:24.056
She left without
even saying good-bye?

20:24.222 --> 20:26.392
To her credit,
we did just tear gas everyone.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.740
Also, she's insane.

20:27.865 --> 20:29.075
You know, it might be
the bath salts talking,

20:29.200 --> 20:30.855
- but I love that girl.
- Awesome.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.077
Dude, if you're in love with her,

20:32.202 --> 20:35.113
then we need to go
find her, like, now.

20:35.238 --> 20:37.282
She spends most of her time
under a bridge on 12th street.

20:37.407 --> 20:39.918
She's got a box.
It's a good little spot.

20:40.043 --> 20:42.154
Uh, fastest way there is the 405.

20:42.279 --> 20:43.946
Really?

20:44.326 --> 20:46.158
Let's take this thing on the freeway!

20:46.283 --> 20:47.391
