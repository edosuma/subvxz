- How much is a hamburger and a coffee?
- 45 pence.

00:14.176 --> 00:15.634
45 pence...

00:18.217 --> 00:20.801
- 45?
- 45, yes.

00:23.217 --> 00:25.301

00:53.301 --> 00:56.426
You've got to make the most
of what life offers you.

00:57.842 --> 01:00.259
Life isn't meant to be easy.

01:00.384 --> 01:02.342
Not for anybody.

01:02.467 --> 01:06.926
OK, some of us may start out
with more than others.

01:07.051 --> 01:10.592
More... advantages, you might say.

01:11.717 --> 01:13.801
That's not the main item.

01:15.009 --> 01:19.092
It's basically every man for himself.

01:22.384 --> 01:24.676
Take the two of us, for instance.

01:24.801 --> 01:28.426
What did we start with?
What did we do with ourselves?

01:29.301 --> 01:31.384
For a start, there's my 'O' levels.

01:31.509 --> 01:32.592
Two!

01:32.717 --> 01:36.759
Ah! Now, there's a fair advantage
you might say, eh?

01:36.884 --> 01:38.967
But I worked for them.

01:40.134 --> 01:43.217
You see,
that's what you and I have in common.

01:43.342 --> 01:47.134
Not the 'O' levels, no.
The advantages, eh?

01:47.259 --> 01:51.509
You know, the little supports
that help us along life's weary way.

01:53.259 --> 01:55.467
Let's face facts, Earl.

01:56.551 --> 01:59.176
We've had our fair share of advantages.

02:02.342 --> 02:06.676
Like, for instance,
you had a nice, warm country,

02:06.801 --> 02:10.508
money, a big house,

02:10.633 --> 02:13.217
girls, a big horse.

02:13.342 --> 02:17.426
Aye. And I bet you ate
a lot of nice curries up at that...

02:17.551 --> 02:19.426
Kandahar, eh?

02:19.551 --> 02:21.634
Nicely done, Earl.

02:23.176 --> 02:25.259
Oh, wait a minute here.

02:27.051 --> 02:31.301
I don't see too many 'O' levels there,
Earl old son.

02:31.426 --> 02:33.676
How did you do it?

02:33.801 --> 02:36.509
And why the bloody hell
don't I have a job?

02:37.967 --> 02:39.009
Oi!

02:40.342 --> 02:45.259
Go on your bike! I'm trying
to sleep here. Come on, clear off!

02:45.384 --> 02:47.259
Go on!

03:49.134 --> 03:52.467
...PX-135 conversion
for the quadraphonic speakers.

03:52.592 --> 03:55.592
You've got the wattage meters
built in at the start.

03:55.717 --> 04:00.384
- How much is that?
- Including the pre-amp, that'd be £740.

04:00.509 --> 04:04.134
- What about the FM tuner with...
- Automatic phase tracker?

04:04.259 --> 04:07.217
- Aye, automatic phase tracker.
- Another £460.

04:07.342 --> 04:10.092
You've got the basics
for a first-rate system.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.801
- Eh?
- The basics.

04:11.926 --> 04:14.509
Oh, the basics.

04:14.634 --> 04:20.259
If you took the Elite speakers, I could
give you the lot for, say, 1,080?

04:20.384 --> 04:23.301
- Have you got a cigarette?
- Aye, certainly.

04:30.676 --> 04:33.592
You're tempting me,
but I want tae think about it.

04:33.717 --> 04:36.301
- About that automatic...
- Phase tracker?

04:36.426 --> 04:39.926
Aye, phase tracker.
I'll pop in on Friday and let you know.

04:40.051 --> 04:44.092
Thanks a lot. That piss-taker,
I mean phase tracker is magic.

04:53.967 --> 04:57.717
Aye, my dad only needs it on Saturday,
so it's mine all week.

04:57.842 --> 05:00.217
- I've got to buy my own petrol.
- Really?

05:00.342 --> 05:02.717
Aye, it's 20 miles
to the gallon in town.

05:02.842 --> 05:05.759
- That's tough.
- Are you working yet...?

05:05.884 --> 05:09.301
- That's tough, too.
- Well, things are tough all over.

05:09.426 --> 05:11.717
Aye. I have to scoot now. See you!

05:38.301 --> 05:40.176
Oh, come on!

05:51.634 --> 05:55.092
- Where are you going?
- I'm going for a walk. See you later.

05:55.217 --> 05:58.051
- I'll get it fixed in a minute.
- It's no' that...

05:58.176 --> 06:01.301
- I'll no' be a minute.
- See you later, Ronnie.

06:04.634 --> 06:07.092
The rain's definitely goin' off, eh?

06:07.217 --> 06:09.509
It sure is.

06:09.634 --> 06:12.092
A good shower
really cleans the place up.

06:12.217 --> 06:14.384
It makes the world sparkle.

06:14.509 --> 06:16.592
It sure does.

06:19.634 --> 06:21.717
Did you have a good day?

06:21.842 --> 06:25.759
- Very enjoyable.
- Same here. Very, very enjoyable.

06:25.884 --> 06:28.176
Me, too. In the park mostly.

06:35.051 --> 06:37.134
It's miserable, isn't it?

06:37.259 --> 06:38.717
Yeah.

06:40.301 --> 06:42.467
I tried to kill myself today.

06:45.092 --> 06:46.967
Just after you left, Wal.

06:47.092 --> 06:50.926
I took a mouthful of Corn Flakes
and milk and held my nose shut.

06:53.467 --> 06:57.301
I tried to drown myself
in Corn Flakes and milk!

06:57.426 --> 07:00.884
No, if you want to kill yourself,
what you dae is,

07:01.009 --> 07:04.509
you stand somewhere wet,
get yourself a good earth,

07:04.634 --> 07:07.092
then plug yourself into the mains.

07:07.217 --> 07:09.217
That's what I was gonnae dae.

07:09.342 --> 07:10.801
Woof!

07:13.342 --> 07:16.551
No, I think the best way
is out a window.

07:16.676 --> 07:18.634
Really high up.

07:18.759 --> 07:21.634
Hit the ground at 120 mile an hour.

07:21.759 --> 07:25.717
I was gonnae try that up
at the high flats, but the lifts were stuck.

07:25.842 --> 07:28.634
Couldnae be bothered climbing
400 stairs.

07:28.759 --> 07:32.759
Christ, you'd be fit for nothing
by the time you got to the top!

07:36.551 --> 07:39.717
There's got to be more to life
than committing suicide.

07:41.759 --> 07:45.551
There's got to be something.
There's got to be some way out.

07:54.926 --> 07:56.967
I think the rain's gone off, eh?

07:57.092 --> 07:59.176
Oh, beat it, eh?

07:59.301 --> 08:01.467
Are youse comin' down the road then?

08:01.592 --> 08:04.092
- Are youse goin'?
- Aye, come on.

08:15.634 --> 08:20.717
Hey! Do you no' think it's time you traded
that in for something wi' wheels?

12:08.176 --> 12:12.926
I'm sorry I had to drag youse all out on
such a cold night, but now we're all here,

12:13.051 --> 12:16.176
well, Ronnie wants to say something.

12:24.926 --> 12:29.926
I've got a lot to say, boys, but I've just
got one key word to say first of all.

12:33.717 --> 12:35.384
Sink.

12:49.926 --> 12:51.801
No, no.

12:52.967 --> 12:56.092
Get up. Let me put it another way, eh?

13:00.342 --> 13:02.759
We are sittin' on a gold mine.

13:04.634 --> 13:07.967
Or should I say a steel mine?
A stainless steel mine!

13:09.676 --> 13:13.426
Look, what's this area famous for?

13:13.551 --> 13:15.717
What's it well known for?

13:15.842 --> 13:16.884
Drunks.

13:18.051 --> 13:19.842
Muggers.

13:19.967 --> 13:23.134
- Multiple social deprivation!
- Sinks!

13:23.259 --> 13:25.426
Stainless steel sinks.

13:25.551 --> 13:28.467
Hundreds of them
up at Martin's warehouse.

13:28.592 --> 13:33.009
- Sinks worth a fortune.
- You mean where I used tae work?

13:33.134 --> 13:36.092
Aye, we mean where you used tae work.

13:37.384 --> 13:40.092
The sinks come at 60 quid apiece.

13:40.217 --> 13:43.884
An hour in there and we could shift 80,
maybe 90 into a van.

13:44.009 --> 13:47.342
60 times 90? Hey, that's over 100 quid!

13:50.426 --> 13:53.259
- Where will we get a van?
- Vic's mate's a van boy.

13:53.384 --> 13:56.967
He's gonnae get it fixed up wi' him.
Any Corn Flakes?

13:57.092 --> 13:59.551
No. Sugar Puffs...?

13:59.676 --> 14:02.092
Hey, we need a modus exper...

14:02.217 --> 14:04.467
Eh, a modul oper...

14:04.592 --> 14:07.051
Och, you mean a modus operandi?

14:07.176 --> 14:09.467
No, we need a way tae get in!

14:18.426 --> 14:21.259
- Wal, put your shoes on.
- Aye.

14:26.051 --> 14:31.759
Decoys. Two guys dressed up as cleaning
ladies to take care of the night-watchman.

14:31.884 --> 14:35.967
You know, we can get wigs
and make-up, a dress.

14:36.092 --> 14:38.176
I'll be one of them.

14:47.801 --> 14:50.092
Good idea, Vic.

14:50.217 --> 14:52.384
We need some inside information.

14:52.509 --> 14:55.926
Alec, where did you say you worked
before you got the sack?

14:56.051 --> 14:58.467
The accounts department.

14:58.592 --> 15:02.967
It was unfair dismissal! It's no' my fault
I'm no' a walking computer.

15:03.092 --> 15:06.301
OK, men, back to work. Keep thinking.

15:06.426 --> 15:10.426
This job's gonnae be perfect.
It's gonnae be a work of art.

15:10.551 --> 15:14.467
We're gonnae be rich.
But we still need some more guys, though.

15:14.592 --> 15:17.634
Vic, get the van fixed up, right?

15:17.759 --> 15:20.467
- Are you sure you've nae Corn Flakes?
- No.

15:20.592 --> 15:23.592
Alec, remember anything you can
about the layout.

15:23.717 --> 15:26.134
Doors, windows, anything. Draw a plan.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.842
Wal, check the night-watchman.
See where he spends the night.

15:29.967 --> 15:33.134
Check out his routine.
What else do we need?

15:33.259 --> 15:37.426
Four or five more people
with skill, courage and determination.

16:14.009 --> 16:16.759
- Morning rolls?
- Ten dozen.

16:16.884 --> 16:18.759
- Jam sponges?
- No.

16:18.884 --> 16:20.467
- Bridies?
- No.

16:20.592 --> 16:22.676

- No.

16:22.801 --> 16:24.884

- A dozen.

16:25.009 --> 16:27.176
- Paris buns?
- No.

16:27.301 --> 16:29.301
- Small Alberts?
- No.

16:29.426 --> 16:31.759
- Chocolate doughnuts?
- A dozen.

16:31.884 --> 16:34.301
- Iced doughnuts?
- No.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.176
- Sugar doughnuts?
- No.

16:36.301 --> 16:38.592
- Apple turnovers?
- A dozen.

16:38.717 --> 16:40.967
- Madeira cake?
- No.

16:41.092 --> 16:42.967
Angel cake...?

16:43.092 --> 16:44.967
- Ginger slabs?
- No.

16:45.092 --> 16:46.759
- Albert slabs?
- Dozen.

16:47.842 --> 16:51.134
- What's wrang?
- I've got something to tell you, Bobby.

16:51.259 --> 16:54.176
We cannae talk here.
We'll go somewhere quiet.

16:54.301 --> 16:58.426
- I cannae leave the shop.
- Just a couple of minutes. That's all.

17:18.259 --> 17:20.134
- Sultana cake?
- No.

17:20.259 --> 17:21.925
- Cream cookies?
- No.

17:22.050 --> 17:24.092
- Apple slab?
- Two.

17:44.134 --> 17:45.759
You've got a van.

17:45.884 --> 17:48.634
Well, what do you think?

17:51.926 --> 17:53.467
Well?

17:53.592 --> 17:55.676
Sorry, I couldn't hear you.

17:56.759 --> 17:58.342
Oh, fuck.

17:58.467 --> 18:00.551
- Small trifles?
- No.

18:00.676 --> 18:01.842
- Large trifles?
- No.

18:02.759 --> 18:05.176
It's a big job.

18:07.717 --> 18:09.301
Local...

18:16.842 --> 18:18.926
High-class goods.

18:20.259 --> 18:22.342
Fool-proof entry.

18:33.717 --> 18:36.259
We want a look-out.

18:36.384 --> 18:39.009
Plus someone that can handle alarms.

18:46.342 --> 18:49.801
Oh, for God's sake,
it's like a public park here!

18:50.967 --> 18:53.342
Come on, let's get somewhere quieter.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.051
Shoo!

19:10.926 --> 19:13.509
It's magic, this place, in the summer.

19:29.384 --> 19:31.884
So, a good alarm man is what we need.

19:32.009 --> 19:35.259
One circuit does the whole place,
as far as we know,

19:35.384 --> 19:38.342
then one, maybe two good look-outs,
you know?

19:38.467 --> 19:41.301
One on the inside
and one outside on the road.

19:42.509 --> 19:47.342
We want people
with skill, courage and determination.

19:52.717 --> 19:54.259
What's up?

19:56.384 --> 19:58.801
It's quite choppy today, isn't it?

20:04.676 --> 20:09.217
I'm sorry to be a bother, Ronnie,
but I'm just not a very good sailor.

20:10.592 --> 20:13.717
I'm very keen on the job, though.
It sounds fine.

20:15.259 --> 20:17.342
I'd be fine if I was sick.

20:31.592 --> 20:34.259
Come in, number seven, your time's up!

20:35.384 --> 20:37.801
Keep away fae thae swans. They're evil.

20:37.926 --> 20:40.676
They can break your arms
with their muzzles.

20:40.801 --> 20:44.967
- Beaks.
- Aye, beaks. Ducks aren't so vicious.

21:32.801 --> 21:36.384
- Hey, where's New York?
- 3,000 miles that way.

21:39.967 --> 21:43.426
- Where's Australia?
- 12,000 miles that way.

21:48.884 --> 21:52.176
- Where's China?
- 5,000 miles that way.

21:55.092 --> 21:58.092
Ask me the capital of Ethiopia.

21:59.592 --> 22:02.217
OK, what's the capital of Ethiopia?

22:02.342 --> 22:04.676
Addis Ababa.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.884
- What's six and eight?
- 14.

22:08.759 --> 22:10.842
Rubbish! Naewhere near it.

22:10.967 --> 22:13.051
- Aye, it is.
- You're miles off it.

22:13.176 --> 22:16.134
- No, I'm not.
- It's naewhere near 14.

22:18.217 --> 22:19.676
Hey!

22:32.551 --> 22:35.759
One of us should talk tae Simmy
and gie him the details.

22:35.884 --> 22:38.509
Tell him about the key
for the warehouse door.

22:38.634 --> 22:42.801
- And the signal to get the gate open.
- Tell him to get the door down quick.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.884
Right. Where will he be?

22:45.009 --> 22:47.717
Up at the Arts Centre.
He looks after the bees.

22:47.842 --> 22:51.592
That's ideal for secret discussions.
It's up on the roof.

22:51.717 --> 22:53.801
It's a good, quiet place to talk.

22:53.926 --> 22:55.967
- Right.
- Right.

23:13.801 --> 23:17.676
<i>♪ All things bright and beautiful... ♪</i>

23:19.967 --> 23:23.092
- Who was that masked man?
- Search me.

23:23.217 --> 23:26.509
Come on. Yeah, come on.

23:26.634 --> 23:29.384
Come on. Sit doon.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.842
Coochie, coochie, coochie....

23:37.884 --> 23:42.051
Coochie, coochie, coochie coo.
Coochie, coochie, coochie coo.

23:48.009 --> 23:50.551
I've got the plan.

23:50.676 --> 23:53.134
If I go get the key for the watchman,

23:53.259 --> 23:56.884
we'll pass it on to the guy
on the inside, the little guy.

23:58.176 --> 24:01.842
He'll go to the back gate
and tap out the signal. Three taps.

24:04.426 --> 24:08.717
The van goes in, the gate
comes down again. Really quick.

24:08.842 --> 24:11.009
Ronnie'll show you the stuff to take.

24:11.134 --> 24:13.217
Just the sinks, nothing else.

24:14.717 --> 24:16.801
What are you daein' here?

24:18.342 --> 24:20.509
What are you daein' here, you mug?

24:20.634 --> 24:23.259
I came to tell Simmy
what you've been sayin'.

24:23.384 --> 24:26.884
I forgot about the two taps.
It's a good job you remembered.

24:27.009 --> 24:28.551
Aye.

24:48.717 --> 24:50.884
It's good to have you with us.

24:51.009 --> 24:56.092
It's a big job, but it's simple
and that's the beauty of it.

24:56.217 --> 24:58.926
We're all going to be rich.

24:59.051 --> 25:01.634
Have you finished with this roll here?

25:02.884 --> 25:07.176
Big, big money.
Capital for anything you want.

25:07.301 --> 25:10.634
I'm going to make you rich. Come on.

25:15.301 --> 25:18.009
Two coffees and a roll and sausage,
wasn't it?

25:18.134 --> 25:20.217
- Yeah.
- 57 pence, please.

25:21.301 --> 25:24.509
I wonder if you could take care
of the coffees?

25:24.634 --> 25:28.134
Look, I've left my wallet
in my other jacket pocket.

25:28.259 --> 25:30.676
I'll square you up later. I'm sorry.

25:30.801 --> 25:33.134
You're a screwball!

25:33.259 --> 25:36.759
Big money, eh?
Lots of capital, do what you want!

25:36.884 --> 25:39.967
- You cannae even buy me a coffee?
- I'm sorry.

25:40.092 --> 25:44.551
How do you expect to do a robbery and
you can't even buy me a cup of coffee?

25:44.676 --> 25:48.051
That's what we're daein' it for.
We've nae money just noo!

25:48.176 --> 25:50.176
Can't do a robbery without money!

25:50.301 --> 25:54.384
I'm in the gang two minutes,
two minutes and I'm losing already!

26:25.551 --> 26:28.842
OK, lads,
can I have your attention, please?

26:30.134 --> 26:32.676
Come on, a wee bit of hush, attention!

26:35.009 --> 26:38.092
Will you shut up
and give me your attention?

26:38.217 --> 26:40.301
Down...

26:40.426 --> 26:42.717
Will you shut up!

26:42.842 --> 26:45.759
Right, lads,
the boss wants a word with you.

26:51.009 --> 26:52.467
Thanks.

26:53.634 --> 26:59.426
I'd just like to say you're doing
a great job. Keep up the good work.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.009
Thanks.

27:25.092 --> 27:27.176
What does it do?

27:27.301 --> 27:30.509
It puts the alarm system
out of action completely.

27:31.551 --> 27:33.426
How does it work?

27:33.551 --> 27:36.467
You find the main fuse box
inside the warehouse.

27:36.592 --> 27:40.092
- Yeah.
- Locate the fuse for the alarm circuit.

27:40.217 --> 27:42.884
- Yeah.
- Then you throw this box at it.

27:43.009 --> 27:46.009
- It should knock it tae fuck!
- Yeah.

27:46.134 --> 27:48.176
Hey, what does that dae?

27:48.301 --> 27:51.426
It puts the alarm system
out of action completely.

27:54.217 --> 27:56.384
Head up. Swing your arm.

27:57.467 --> 28:00.509
- Wal, stop muckin' about.
- I'm no' muckin' about!

28:00.634 --> 28:02.301
- Aye, you are.
- I'm no'!

28:02.426 --> 28:04.342
We've got dresses to try on and make-up.

28:04.467 --> 28:06.301
I'm tryin' my best!

28:06.426 --> 28:10.092
- What else have we got to do?
- Have you got the clothes?

28:10.217 --> 28:12.134
- Aye. You?
- Aye.

28:12.259 --> 28:14.676
- Everything ready?
- Aye.

28:14.801 --> 28:18.092
But... how do you become a girl?

28:18.217 --> 28:21.926
Convince yourself first
before anything else.

28:22.051 --> 28:24.967
- Tell yourself you're a girl.
- How?

28:25.092 --> 28:27.759
- 'I'm a girl.' Say it.
- I'm a girl.

28:27.884 --> 28:30.676
- That's it. Try, Wal. It helps.
- I'm a girl.

28:30.801 --> 28:33.176
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

28:33.301 --> 28:35.634
- Wal, try it.
- No, I'm no' sayin' that.

28:35.759 --> 28:37.342
- Wal!
- No!

28:37.467 --> 28:39.342
- I'm a girl.
- You're an eejit!

28:39.467 --> 28:42.051
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

28:42.176 --> 28:46.176
- You like this, don't you?
- No... Aye, I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

28:46.301 --> 28:47.842
- Try it.
- No!

28:47.967 --> 28:50.176
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

28:50.301 --> 28:52.176
- Wal, try it.
- No!

28:57.467 --> 29:00.717
Oh, no.
It's a three-week high-protein diet.

29:00.842 --> 29:03.217
It was in last week's <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

29:07.467 --> 29:10.176
Is anything worrying you just now?

29:10.301 --> 29:12.384
Are you quite happy?

29:12.509 --> 29:16.509
Well, there was one or two things
I wanted to talk to you about.

29:17.634 --> 29:20.967
Would you wear a brown skirt
with a red top,

29:21.092 --> 29:23.551
say, a really deep red, kind of maroon

29:23.676 --> 29:26.301
with maybe grey tights?

29:28.051 --> 29:30.467
Vic, what's wrong with you?

29:31.634 --> 29:35.801
Aye, right, brown tights.
It needs to be brown tights. Brown tights.

29:38.134 --> 29:40.009
What's up?

29:41.134 --> 29:45.467
Look, Mary, it's good.
It'll bring us closer together.

29:45.592 --> 29:48.676
We'll be able to share things,
talk about the same things,

29:48.801 --> 29:50.634
make-up and frocks.

29:50.759 --> 29:54.176
- We can be real buddies.
- I've got girlfriends for that!

29:54.301 --> 29:57.426
It's meant to be different with you.

29:57.551 --> 30:00.134
Look, I know what I'm doing.

30:00.259 --> 30:02.342
It's gonnae work out fine.

30:03.717 --> 30:07.009
Tell me. Talk to me about it.

30:11.217 --> 30:15.592
I'm just interested in girls.
I mean, I like them.

30:15.717 --> 30:18.259
You don't have to BE one!

30:18.384 --> 30:23.134
Of course not. I'm a boy.
I'm a boy. I'm a boy!

30:23.259 --> 30:26.384
- I want my lipstick back.
- Eh?

30:26.509 --> 30:30.967
The one you took from my bag last night
when we were saying 'good night'.

30:33.051 --> 30:35.384
I'm still a good kisser, eh?

30:35.509 --> 30:39.801
- What's goin' on, Vic? Eh?
- I'll tell you soon.

30:39.926 --> 30:41.801
- Tell me now!
- Soon!

31:03.551 --> 31:05.634
What do you fancy?

31:05.759 --> 31:08.217
I've set my heart on ten days
in Barbados.

31:08.342 --> 31:09.926
Very nice.

31:10.051 --> 31:12.842
It's a four-star hotel,

31:12.967 --> 31:15.634
full board, return flight for, eh...

31:16.967 --> 31:19.967
...just over four sinks. It's no' bad.

31:20.092 --> 31:23.092
Ah, but look,
if you put in an extra sink,

31:23.217 --> 31:26.842
you can get the African safari
with five nights in Nairobi.

31:27.926 --> 31:30.717
I don't know.
It's awful difficult to choose.

31:30.842 --> 31:33.509
Here, what are you gonnae dae
wi' your sinks?

31:33.634 --> 31:35.801
I've got my eye on a lovely, wee CSL.

31:35.926 --> 31:38.009
- Oh.
- A guitar, you know?

31:38.134 --> 31:40.217
- An amplifier box.
- Mm-hm.

31:40.342 --> 31:42.884
A wah-wah pedal, you know? Wah-wah!

31:45.717 --> 31:48.051
I've even got the plectrum.

31:48.176 --> 31:49.842
Show me.

31:49.967 --> 31:52.384
Aye, very good.

31:52.509 --> 31:55.134
Huh! Give us a tune.

31:55.259 --> 31:58.009
<i>♪ Da-na-na, dan-dan-dan</i>

31:58.134 --> 32:01.842
<i>♪ I don't want a holiday in the sun</i>

32:01.967 --> 32:04.967
<i>♪ I wanna go to the new Belsen... ♪</i>

32:05.092 --> 32:08.009
I'm a boy. I'm a boy.

32:08.134 --> 32:10.092
I'm a boy!

32:21.342 --> 32:23.342
Does it involve other boys?

32:24.676 --> 32:26.967
No, of course not.

32:27.092 --> 32:29.051
It's just me.

32:37.634 --> 32:39.509
How's Vicky?

32:41.842 --> 32:45.509
I've got my sister's shoes.
She won't miss them at the weekend.

32:45.634 --> 32:47.967
Not now, Alec. Later.

32:50.176 --> 32:53.634
But it's about the brassiere.
I could only get a 36B.

32:53.759 --> 32:57.092
There's hunners o' room in the straps.
It'll fit you OK.

32:58.717 --> 33:02.384
Have you got the lipstick for Wal?
You said you'd get it for him.

33:02.509 --> 33:05.301
He cannae get lipstick.
You said you'd get it.

33:05.426 --> 33:07.301
You away, Mary?

33:08.509 --> 33:11.301
What about thae tights?
Did you get the red ones?

33:30.467 --> 33:33.092
- What about the van?
- Bobby's fine.

33:33.217 --> 33:36.884
Two days' notice is all he needs.
Everything's worked out.

33:38.051 --> 33:40.301
15th floor. Be here in a minute.

33:42.467 --> 33:44.426
What's he gonnae do?

33:44.551 --> 33:49.259
His driver always has tea from a flask.
He'll put something in it, knock him out.

33:49.384 --> 33:52.176
- The van's his.
- What's he gonnae knock...

33:52.301 --> 33:54.384
How are you, boys?

33:57.009 --> 33:59.176
What's he gonnae knock him out with?

33:59.301 --> 34:01.676
Chemicals. A special mixture.

34:01.801 --> 34:05.967
Bobby knows what he's doing.
Don't worry. It's guaranteed.

34:06.092 --> 34:08.801
Is the van driver guaranteed
to wake up again?

34:08.926 --> 34:11.551
Aye, Bobby knows the score.

34:11.676 --> 34:14.259
Two days' notice he wants?

34:14.384 --> 34:16.551
That makes it Wednesday night.

34:18.134 --> 34:21.717
OK, tell the boys
we hit Martin's on Wednesday night.

34:27.884 --> 34:30.217
All right then?

34:42.717 --> 34:44.384
Wednesday.

34:55.551 --> 34:57.217
Tuesday.

35:03.967 --> 35:06.134
- Wednesday.
- Are you sure?

35:06.259 --> 35:08.551
Wednesday, Wednesday!

35:08.676 --> 35:12.926
- Buy me a coffee, Simmy?
- Wed... en... sday!

35:30.051 --> 35:31.926
It's Wednesday.

35:34.217 --> 35:38.551
Pay attention, lads. We've got to know
all these signals for the big night.

35:38.676 --> 35:41.967
Number one,
two arms waved across the chest

35:42.092 --> 35:44.092
is the signal for 'start loading'.

35:45.176 --> 35:47.259
Start loading!

35:50.509 --> 35:52.592
Start loading.

35:52.717 --> 35:55.467
I'll dae it again. Start loading.

35:55.592 --> 35:57.676
Start loading.

36:00.176 --> 36:02.259
So it's start loading?

36:03.551 --> 36:05.634
We'll dae it again.

36:07.134 --> 36:09.134
Start loading!

36:22.217 --> 36:24.509
We're makin' good time today, Bob.

36:24.634 --> 36:27.051
Only two drops to do.

36:27.176 --> 36:29.467
Should be finished pretty sharp.

36:34.134 --> 36:36.884
I'll sleep like a log tonight.

36:37.009 --> 36:39.926
- What are you up to yourself?
- Wednesday?

36:40.051 --> 36:43.551
- I've got my night school tonight.
- What are you learning?

36:45.092 --> 36:47.176
- Chemistry.
- Oh, just the man.

36:47.301 --> 36:49.801
Can you do love potions?

36:50.884 --> 36:52.634
Maybe.

36:52.759 --> 36:54.842
Could you do one for my wife?

36:54.967 --> 36:56.842
Maybe.

36:56.967 --> 36:59.759
Could you make her run away
wi' somebody else?

38:01.134 --> 38:02.592
Hey!

39:26.967 --> 39:28.926
Ronnie!

39:29.051 --> 39:30.926
Ronnie!

39:32.051 --> 39:35.051
Ronnie! Ronnie! Ronnie!

39:35.176 --> 39:37.801
Ronnie! Ronnie!

39:37.926 --> 39:40.676
Ronnie! Ronnie! It's me!

39:40.801 --> 39:43.384
Don't jump! It's only me!

39:44.967 --> 39:47.842
Davy, ya bastard, ye!

39:47.967 --> 39:50.134
Are you tryin' tae kill me?

39:56.717 --> 39:58.592
Come on.

40:08.051 --> 40:10.301
Aye, come on.

40:10.426 --> 40:13.426
I'm sorry if I gave you
a fright there, Ronnie.

40:13.551 --> 40:17.176
It's an automatic reaction.
It comes with the training.

40:18.259 --> 40:20.301
That's OK.

40:21.384 --> 40:23.426
I can appreciate that.

40:23.551 --> 40:24.926
Oh!

40:25.051 --> 40:28.842
You've obviously got
the reactions of a tiger.

40:32.717 --> 40:34.259
Oh, gee...

40:40.884 --> 40:44.384
How are you? I havenae seen you
since we left school.

40:44.509 --> 40:47.301
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.

40:48.759 --> 40:52.134
You've grown a bit.
You used to be about...

40:53.176 --> 40:55.342
I just sprouted in the past year.

41:00.634 --> 41:02.884
Are you still playin' the violin?

41:03.009 --> 41:04.551
No.

41:06.801 --> 41:09.217
Are you workin' yourself?

41:09.342 --> 41:11.009
No!

41:13.926 --> 41:16.634
How's the gang?

41:16.759 --> 41:19.592
What gang? I don't know any gangs.

41:19.717 --> 41:22.467
If you're looking for a gang guy,
you've got the wrang guy.

41:22.592 --> 41:24.509
I don't know any gangs, honest!

41:24.634 --> 41:27.092
The boys!

41:27.217 --> 41:30.259
- The boys?
- Aye, Simmy.

41:30.384 --> 41:32.842
- Simmy?
- And Vic.

41:32.967 --> 41:35.842
- Vic?
- And Wal.

41:35.967 --> 41:38.717
Is he still up to his daft, old tricks?

41:38.842 --> 41:41.426
Remember the time he wanted us
to break into Aldo's cafe

41:41.551 --> 41:43.634
and steal all
his cheese and onion crisps?

41:43.759 --> 41:46.634
That Wal's a bad yin
and he always has been.

41:46.759 --> 41:49.967
No, we were just boys. Daft boys.

41:52.592 --> 41:54.634
Do you want to see my whistle?

41:54.759 --> 41:56.217
Aye.

42:04.634 --> 42:06.676
Name, laddie.

42:09.217 --> 42:11.301
This is my notebook.

42:12.426 --> 42:14.009
Name!

42:15.509 --> 42:17.592
Ronnie Munro.

42:20.426 --> 42:23.884
No... fixed... abode.

42:25.134 --> 42:28.134
That's Glasgow G40, isn't it?

42:28.259 --> 42:30.884
Glasgow G40.

42:37.592 --> 42:39.676
I know you're not a bad lad.

42:40.842 --> 42:42.301
Yeah...

42:43.342 --> 42:47.009
Just mixin' with the wrong crowd.
That's all.

42:47.134 --> 42:49.217
Do yourself a favour.

42:54.634 --> 42:56.717
Come on, take them off.

43:12.384 --> 43:15.801
Christ, Ronnie,
I seem to have lost the key!

43:17.009 --> 43:21.134
Eh, look, you'd better come down
to the station to get a spare.

43:27.634 --> 43:30.101
Tango 81 to base. Tango 81...

43:31.555 --> 43:33.434
Please repeat.

43:35.009 --> 43:38.009
That's two pound of sugar
and one pint of milk.

43:38.134 --> 43:40.301
Right, over and out.

44:29.217 --> 44:31.509
Look, relax.

44:41.092 --> 44:43.592
See when they snapped shut?

44:43.717 --> 44:48.884
I could see my whole life flash
before my eyes. It was horrible, Wal.

44:49.009 --> 44:51.509
Och, you're safe now.

44:56.009 --> 44:59.301
I mean, look.
The rain's goin' aff as well.

44:59.426 --> 45:01.801
We might get a good night for it.

45:03.134 --> 45:04.884
Are you no' excited?

45:06.092 --> 45:08.592
I mean, it's been hard work.

45:08.717 --> 45:11.967
Yeah, everybody's been great.

45:12.092 --> 45:16.259
I'm sorry
it's all going to be over so soon.

45:17.967 --> 45:20.551
If it works, you can do it again.

45:20.676 --> 45:24.842
- Another job?
- Why not? You might have a flair for it.

45:24.967 --> 45:26.759
Naw.

45:26.884 --> 45:31.051
I think I'll just retire
on my ill-gotten drains.

45:32.092 --> 45:34.842
Hey, cheers anyway. Eh?

45:38.009 --> 45:40.092
I have to go.

45:41.134 --> 45:43.634
Still got my hair to do.

45:43.759 --> 45:47.176
Hey, stay cool, eh? I'll see you later.

46:03.967 --> 46:06.801
Give us a cup of tea, will you, Bob?

46:07.842 --> 46:11.801
Don't you want to stop
and have it properly?

46:11.926 --> 46:14.634
Nah, keep going and get finished early.

46:17.342 --> 46:19.467
Have it your way.

46:36.217 --> 46:38.009
Thanks.

49:46.459 --> 49:49.551
- Everything OK?
- Fine.

49:50.599 --> 49:52.801
What's that?

49:53.842 --> 49:56.759
It's the driver.
I couldn't just dump him.

49:56.884 --> 50:01.051
Do we have to take him all over with us?

50:01.176 --> 50:04.342
- How long's he gonnae be out for?
- I don't know.

50:04.467 --> 50:08.217
It's the first time I've tried it
on a human.

50:08.342 --> 50:10.842
What did you try it on before?

50:10.967 --> 50:13.051
A mouse.

50:15.842 --> 50:17.551
How long was it out for?

50:18.592 --> 50:22.342
Four month...
but it woke up in perfect health.

50:22.509 --> 50:27.301
- Jesus! Four months?!
- Get the boys in or we're gonnae be late.

50:33.176 --> 50:37.134
- Ronnie, who's the stiff?
- Get in!

51:37.759 --> 51:40.217
Aw, look at your hair. What a mess!

51:40.342 --> 51:43.342
- It was the rain!
- Shove on a scarf!

51:43.467 --> 51:45.551
- Where's the wee man?
- Here.

51:52.551 --> 51:54.592
Come on.

51:54.717 --> 51:57.426
You really are a sight.

52:02.134 --> 52:06.301
Let me do the talkin'.
Don't throw yourself at him.

52:06.426 --> 52:11.009
We'll play hard to get for the first
half hour, then we'll play it by ear.

52:11.134 --> 52:14.051
Where did you get that awful brooch?

53:26.509 --> 53:29.009
Good evening, ladies.

53:35.176 --> 53:38.176
You probably think
we're a pair of silly girls,

53:38.301 --> 53:40.426
but is this Abernathy's factory?

53:40.551 --> 53:44.759
We're supposed to clean the offices,
but we can't seem to find the place.

53:44.884 --> 53:49.092
- Silly girls that we are.
- Nah, you're a long way frae Abernathy's.

53:49.217 --> 53:53.242
- A fair bit aff your track.
- It's our first night, too.

53:53.342 --> 53:55.342
What will we do?

53:55.467 --> 53:59.426
Well, you just sit down here
and have a nice cup of tea.

53:59.551 --> 54:01.092
You can phone the man

54:01.217 --> 54:05.051
and don't you worry
your pretty little head about it, OK?

54:09.634 --> 54:14.342
What do you think, Marion, dear?
Will we stay here with the nice... man?

54:23.967 --> 54:28.717
Excuse me. Is there a wee girls' room
where I could fix my make-up?

54:28.842 --> 54:33.092
Aye, it's right across the corridor.
And... take your time.

54:55.051 --> 54:57.759
'Mmm, I love you, I love you.'

55:15.884 --> 55:20.051
A sweet thing like you
won't need any sugar, eh?

55:45.134 --> 55:48.176
Do you want to go to the wee boys' room?

55:50.051 --> 55:52.592
Don't you catch cold, mind. The key's...

55:52.717 --> 55:55.467
The key's in the lavatory pan upstairs.

56:34.884 --> 56:37.467
Key's in the pan. Key's in the pan...

56:40.467 --> 56:43.176
Key's in the pan. Key's in the pan.

56:44.884 --> 56:47.592
Key's in the pan. Key's in the pan.

57:08.801 --> 57:11.717
The key's in the... pan.

58:09.051 --> 58:13.801
What the hell's going on in there?
We're 10 minutes behind already.

58:13.926 --> 58:16.842
- Relax.
- Relax?!

58:18.801 --> 58:22.967
Maybe you'd give me a wee something
to put me oot for a couple of centuries.

58:23.092 --> 58:25.176
Eh, Doctor?!

58:51.801 --> 58:55.759
Sorry, wee hold up.
There's loads of pans.

59:41.092 --> 59:45.301
Hey, Andy, your sister will kill you
if you get a hole in they tights.

59:45.426 --> 59:49.676
- You did say it was a robbery.
- Watch you don't go too fast.

59:49.801 --> 59:53.051
They're run-resistant.
You'll break a leg.

59:53.176 --> 59:58.176
Let's get back to work, eh? Steel sinks,
kitchen-size. That's all we want.

59:58.301 --> 01:00:02.509
- Alec, what floor are the sinks on?
- Eh, the second floor.

01:00:02.634 --> 01:00:05.217
Aw! THIRD floor! Come on.

01:00:41.301 --> 01:00:44.009
This is the place, lads.

01:00:45.051 --> 01:00:47.676
Let's get tae work.

01:02:05.259 --> 01:02:08.176
Aww, she's a shy one, eh?

01:02:09.217 --> 01:02:11.717
I like the shy ones.

01:02:15.676 --> 01:02:20.467
I wonder where that wee rascal's got to.
I better go and find him.

01:02:22.759 --> 01:02:28.176
He sometimes has trouble with his zip.
Takes after his father. Byesie-bye!

01:03:30.009 --> 01:03:32.717
What are you doing?

01:03:35.259 --> 01:03:39.009
I'm having trouble with this bastard,
missus.

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:46.342
Now you're wet in front of your ears
as well, ya choob!

01:03:51.051 --> 01:03:55.009
- How much is one of these?
- Forty quid.

01:03:57.759 --> 01:04:01.967
For that price,
you'd think you'd get a new one.

01:04:25.676 --> 01:04:27.759
Put it back.

01:04:27.884 --> 01:04:30.867
Gie's a break, Ronnie.
It's my mother's birthday.

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:37.092
You know the rules... these things
are too easily traced. Now put it back.

01:04:45.134 --> 01:04:47.634
Do you know where there's a toilet?

01:04:47.759 --> 01:04:51.926
Alang the corridor, turn to your right,
it's third on the left.

01:05:03.051 --> 01:05:05.134

01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:11.242
Want a wee somethin' tae put in his tea?

01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:14.217
Naw, no thanks, Bob. We can handle it.

01:06:18.342 --> 01:06:21.676
Here, puss... Here, puss, puss, puss.

01:06:21.801 --> 01:06:23.676
Puss...

01:06:54.426 --> 01:06:57.134
What are you doin' after the robbery?

01:06:57.259 --> 01:06:59.926
Haud on! I'm a boy. You know, I'm a boy!

01:07:00.051 --> 01:07:03.134
No, I know that. Em, it's just...

01:07:03.259 --> 01:07:07.634
You doin' any jobs? Any more robberies?
Anything like that?

01:07:07.759 --> 01:07:10.426
Not really thought about it, you know.

01:07:10.551 --> 01:07:13.342
You know, we'd make a good team.

01:07:13.509 --> 01:07:15.676
You've got style.

01:07:15.801 --> 01:07:19.217
Oh, do you think so? Not too showy?

01:07:19.342 --> 01:07:22.259
No, no, not at all. Not at all.

01:07:46.926 --> 01:07:49.426
There ye are. Have a read.

01:08:32.759 --> 01:08:37.551
Go up and tell them that's enough.
We're pulling out in four minutes.

01:08:38.591 --> 01:08:42.551
Check the street. Give us the all-clear
in three and a half minutes.

01:08:42.676 --> 01:08:44.966
- Sure.
- Vic...

01:08:45.091 --> 01:08:47.801
Vic! Get yourself and Wal outside.

01:08:47.926 --> 01:08:51.884
We'll pick you up on the corner
in seven minutes.

01:09:01.926 --> 01:09:04.634
I'm just getting rid of footprints.

01:09:05.634 --> 01:09:08.716
'C'mon, Alec. Time to go home.

01:09:28.134 --> 01:09:30.509
Coo-ee! Can a girl come in?

01:09:41.134 --> 01:09:46.634
Now, now, Marion, dear. It's time we let
this nice man get back to his work.

01:09:46.759 --> 01:09:49.426
Thanks for all your help, sir.

01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:52.242
Aw, it's been a great pleasure, ladies.

01:09:52.341 --> 01:09:55.092
You two mind and take care
of yourselves.

01:09:55.217 --> 01:09:57.242
There's a lot of hoodlums oot there

01:09:57.342 --> 01:09:59.467
that just don't have any respect
for a lady.

01:09:59.592 --> 01:10:01.676
- So take care.
- Thank you.

01:10:17.092 --> 01:10:18.634
Well done, wee man.

01:10:19.676 --> 01:10:22.342
Ho ho! Barbados, here I come!

01:10:22.467 --> 01:10:24.342
Ha-hey!

01:10:30.801 --> 01:10:33.551
First floor.
Sinks and ladies' underwear.

01:11:04.342 --> 01:11:06.426
Thank you.

01:12:37.259 --> 01:12:39.842
I don't know what the place
is coming to.

01:12:39.967 --> 01:12:44.592
They actually got a helicopter on
Martin's roof and lifted the sinks away.

01:12:44.717 --> 01:12:47.009
The mind boggles!

01:13:24.342 --> 01:13:26.426
Know what I'm gonnae dae?

01:13:26.551 --> 01:13:30.259
Go hame and tell Bobby
to get a padlock on the bathroom door.

01:13:31.801 --> 01:13:34.592
Well, not a bad night's
work, eh, fellas?

01:13:35.634 --> 01:13:38.134
93 stainless steel sinks.

01:13:39.759 --> 01:13:42.426
And our very own snoring zombie.

01:13:43.592 --> 01:13:47.759
Don't scoff, smart arse!
He's worth a lot more than your sinks.

01:13:47.884 --> 01:13:52.242
That's a scientific curiosity. I could get
£200 for him up at the university.

01:13:52.342 --> 01:13:54.717
Oh, aye? What do you propose?

01:13:54.842 --> 01:13:58.009
Wheel him to the front door
and ask for the cashier?

01:13:58.134 --> 01:13:59.551
You're a maniac.

01:13:59.676 --> 01:14:03.842
- You're a psychopath.
- I'm no'! I'm a scientist!

01:14:03.967 --> 01:14:08.342
That's suspended animation.
Folk have been trying for ages to do that.

01:14:08.467 --> 01:14:13.634
You could send him through space,
to Saturn, Mars, even Jupiter.

01:14:13.759 --> 01:14:17.717
Short of van drivers on Jupiter,
are they, eh?

01:14:17.842 --> 01:14:20.051
You see problems everywhere.

01:14:20.176 --> 01:14:23.342
A scientific breakthrough's staring you
in the face!

01:14:24.342 --> 01:14:28.009
What about the sinks, Ronnie?
When do we get the money?

01:14:28.134 --> 01:14:30.884
They're too hot
to put on the market just now.

01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:33.134
We're just as well keeping them here.

01:14:33.259 --> 01:14:38.051
- But if anybody has any bright ideas...
- What bright ideas have you got?

01:14:38.176 --> 01:14:41.217
What's the big plan now?

01:14:44.967 --> 01:14:46.759
Hey...

01:14:46.884 --> 01:14:51.217
- Going back to what you said about...
- What about it?

01:14:53.926 --> 01:14:56.842
How much would we get for his kidneys?

01:14:56.967 --> 01:14:58.467
Shut up!

01:14:58.592 --> 01:15:02.592
- He stays in one piece.
- That was a fair question.

01:15:02.717 --> 01:15:07.509
The kidney market's in a very healthy
state. Kidneys flying all over the world.

01:15:07.634 --> 01:15:12.426
But for once I agree with you, Ronnie.
We'll keep him in one piece.

01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:15.242
He's easier to carry that way as well.

01:15:15.342 --> 01:15:20.051
What aboot the money?
That's what we did it for.

01:15:20.176 --> 01:15:23.301
- I want tae book my holiday.
- Where are you goin'?

01:15:23.426 --> 01:15:28.009
A wee place on the east coast.
I saw it on the map. Grangemouth.

01:15:28.134 --> 01:15:33.134
- Fancy coming?
- Er, no, thanks. Maybe next year, eh?

01:15:33.259 --> 01:15:35.967
There's a simple way...

01:15:36.092 --> 01:15:38.842
There's a simple way to do it, Ronnie.

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:43.551
Offload the sinks and split the money
or split the sinks, right now,

01:15:43.676 --> 01:15:46.342
and it's every man for himself. Lads?

01:15:46.509 --> 01:15:50.342
Stop asking people tae make decisions!
Troublemaker!

01:15:50.467 --> 01:15:55.634
Ronnie, I'll take my sinks and call it
a day. How many does it work out at?

01:15:55.759 --> 01:15:59.926
OK, but they don't leave here
until after the weekend.

01:16:00.051 --> 01:16:02.676
Give things a chance to cool down.

01:16:04.759 --> 01:16:08.717
It works out at eight sinks each.
That'll leave some for...

01:18:17.509 --> 01:18:21.717
Most disappointing show,
would you not say? Very boring, really.

01:18:21.842 --> 01:18:24.551
But this... this interests me.

01:18:24.676 --> 01:18:28.426
I'm here to see a man.
He's interested in buying them.

01:18:28.551 --> 01:18:31.242
Really? He must know a thing or two

01:18:31.342 --> 01:18:35.342
about the most recent developments
in the New York School.

01:18:35.467 --> 01:18:39.801
- This is a very, very good piece.
- He'll be along just now.

01:18:39.926 --> 01:18:44.342
You're not the artist? You are?
You're responsible for this?

01:18:44.467 --> 01:18:49.051
- Yeah, yeah.
- Did you bring it here to install it?

01:18:49.176 --> 01:18:54.301
I just brought it to install it. A fella
was interested, but he hasn't turned up.

01:18:54.426 --> 01:18:58.801
- It's not yet part of the show?
- No, it isn't. It's mine.

01:18:58.926 --> 01:19:02.676
- Nothing to do with the gallery?
- No, no, no. It's mine.

01:19:02.801 --> 01:19:07.342
This is perfect for the exhibition
I'm planning about metal sculpture.

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:12.301
I'm buying all the work for the show
and I'd love to buy this. How much is it?

01:19:12.426 --> 01:19:16.051
- You're interested in buying it?
- I am. How much?

01:19:16.176 --> 01:19:19.009
Well, the sinks come about
60 quid apiece.

01:19:19.134 --> 01:19:21.717
I could let you have the four
for... 200.

01:19:22.842 --> 01:19:25.342
That's ridiculously cheap!

01:19:25.467 --> 01:19:29.242
I could fling in some taps,
you could make it 250.

01:19:29.342 --> 01:19:33.884
No, I accept it as a work of art.
I know exactly what you're getting at.

01:19:34.009 --> 01:19:38.176
It's extraordinary.
What do you call it? What's the name?

01:19:38.301 --> 01:19:41.217
- Well, just... Sink.
- Sink?

01:19:41.342 --> 01:19:44.676
Well, I'm happy to buy Sink for...£200?

01:19:44.801 --> 01:19:49.242
- Yes.
- Do you mind actually? It's my lucky day.

01:19:49.342 --> 01:19:52.092
It's absolutely as it should be.

01:19:52.217 --> 01:19:56.967
- Tell me... Sorry, what's your name?
- Cash.

01:19:57.092 --> 01:19:59.592
- Sorry?
- M Cash.

01:19:59.717 --> 01:20:02.176
M Cash. How appropriate.

01:20:02.301 --> 01:20:04.801
Well, Mr Cash, here you are.

01:20:05.842 --> 01:20:08.426
M Cash, Esquire.

01:20:08.551 --> 01:20:10.509
£200.

01:20:10.634 --> 01:20:14.717
- There we are. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

01:21:55.967 --> 01:22:00.134
'Tango Control to all mobiles.
We have another missing bread van.

01:22:00.259 --> 01:22:04.926
'Colour: white. Contents: four dozen pies,
eight dozen morning rolls,

01:22:05.051 --> 01:22:10.217
'two dozen small trifles, three dozen
large trifles, one dozen apple turnovers,

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:13.134
'three dozen iced doughnuts,
no chocolate doughnuts.

01:22:13.259 --> 01:22:14.634
'Repeat: no chocolate doughnuts.'

01:22:36.801 --> 01:22:39.467
Come on, ya stubborn bastard!

01:22:39.592 --> 01:22:42.509
I'll break it
and re-set it up your back!

01:22:42.634 --> 01:22:46.342
- Now, now, Doctor.
- How's the other one?

01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:54.926
It's still the same.

01:22:56.467 --> 01:22:58.759
We've got the computer read-out

01:22:58.884 --> 01:23:03.051
on his biorhythmic electro-magnetic
brainwave sleep pattern, Doctor.

01:23:03.176 --> 01:23:06.301
- Quite interesting reading.
- What's the score?

01:23:06.426 --> 01:23:10.592
According to the analysis
of the normal sleep pattern,

01:23:10.717 --> 01:23:14.884
he's scheduled to wake up
in the year... 2068.

01:23:17.009 --> 01:23:22.009
- Without ageing a single day.
- He'll wake up and want his breakfast.

01:23:23.259 --> 01:23:26.301
Carrying the hopes,

01:23:26.426 --> 01:23:31.009
the dreams, the fears of all of us
into the next century!

01:23:31.134 --> 01:23:35.301
The sink, Doctor. Don't forget,
he'll be carrying that, too.

01:23:35.426 --> 01:23:40.217
There's so much more
we could be telling them! Giving them!

01:23:40.342 --> 01:23:43.301
All they're going to get
is a bloody sink!

01:23:43.426 --> 01:23:46.759
When he wakes up,
he'll be a billionaire.

01:23:46.884 --> 01:23:51.176
- He's due 80 years of Sick Benefit.
- With compound interest!

01:23:51.301 --> 01:23:54.842
Plus 40 years of Old Age Pension.
He'll be worth a fortune.

01:23:54.967 --> 01:24:00.884
Just think... waking up to start
a new life in the Glasgow of 2068.

01:24:01.009 --> 01:24:06.009
The ring road will be finished!
Partick Thistle in the European Cup!

01:24:06.134 --> 01:24:11.134
The SDA will have started a facelift
in Bearsden... trees everywhere!

01:24:12.176 --> 01:24:15.509
And medicine...
just think of the progress.

01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:20.217
Everybody in Paisley will be able
to have a brain transplant.

01:24:20.342 --> 01:24:21.676
Yeah...

01:24:21.801 --> 01:24:25.967
He's going to wake up
to one hell of a city!

01:24:29.426 --> 01:24:30.467
Hey!

01:24:30.592 --> 01:24:35.426
Wait a minute! He can piss off!
Get a rocket to Australia.

01:24:35.551 --> 01:24:38.134
Be there in an hour!

01:24:38.259 --> 01:24:41.051
He'll no' have to stay here!

01:24:48.676 --> 01:24:53.676
- When's he going to shut up?
- Don't worry. It'll be over in 80 years.

01:25:30.634 --> 01:25:33.551
A bloody miracle, eh?

01:25:34.926 --> 01:25:39.717
I know. I've heard of water intae wine,
but sinks intae doughnuts?!

01:25:39.842 --> 01:25:41.717
Fantastic!

01:25:41.842 --> 01:25:45.801
Well, wait a minute.
If sinks turn into doughnuts,

01:25:45.926 --> 01:25:48.551
what happened tae the driver?

01:25:55.342 --> 01:25:58.676
It's no' him. It's no' snoring!

01:25:58.801 --> 01:26:02.801
Listen, lads,
I've got something important to say.

01:26:02.926 --> 01:26:07.676
I've been thinking. You know that Irn-Bru
factory up the road up at the cross?

01:26:07.801 --> 01:26:10.342
It's a natural for a hit.

01:26:10.509 --> 01:26:13.634
- Naw...
- Look, the summer's coming in.

01:26:13.759 --> 01:26:17.051
Hundreds of thirsty people.
We can make a fortune!

01:26:17.176 --> 01:26:22.176
We can get rid of the guard dogs with
Bobby's chemicals in the kennel meat.

01:26:22.301 --> 01:26:27.717
It's only a 20-foot fence. All we need is
a couple of ropes. No, rope ladders.

01:26:27.842 --> 01:26:30.342
That's the thing. Rope ladders.

01:26:30.467 --> 01:26:33.509
All we dae is connect one end
of the hose

01:26:33.634 --> 01:26:36.092
into the main pump inside the factory.

01:26:36.217 --> 01:26:41.509
That's all inside. And the other end
tae oor tanker ootside. That's all.

01:26:41.634 --> 01:26:46.301
20,000 gallons of Irn-Bru?
Hey, that's no' to be sniffed at.

01:26:46.426 --> 01:26:51.217
We could take the stuff down the coast,
sell it on the beaches.

01:26:51.342 --> 01:26:55.051
- Magic!
- We could drive it to Spain!
