WEBVTT

00:04.205 --> 00:04.505
What happened?

00:08.576 --> 00:12.113
He...

00:12.146 --> 00:14.115
met someone else.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.319
[Through telephone]
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.124
Are -- Are you...

00:23.157 --> 00:24.358
Divorced?

00:24.392 --> 00:28.062
I was gonna say "okay,"
but...

00:28.096 --> 00:30.598
Oh.
Yes.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.133
[Chuckles]

00:32.166 --> 00:38.106
Uh...yeah,
I-I guess I am.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.342
So, are you divorced?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.077
[Chuckles]

00:43.111 --> 00:44.512
Uh, almost.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.115
You know, it's a pain in the ass
doing it from Japan.

00:47.148 --> 00:50.284
So there's all these forms
and trips to the post office

00:50.318 --> 00:53.854
and sending stuff to Texas.

00:53.887 --> 00:59.127
And it all feels
like this weird dream...

00:59.160 --> 01:00.828
[Chuckles]

01:02.763 --> 01:07.668
...being married
and Tokyo...

01:07.701 --> 01:09.470
[Sighs]
I'm sorry.

01:11.372 --> 01:12.740
Do you want
to hear this?

01:12.773 --> 01:16.144
I want to hear
whatever you want to tell me.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.848
I feel like an idiot.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.184
You're not an idiot.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.519
Impulsive, maybe.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.155
Okay, Joe.
[Chuckles]

01:27.188 --> 01:30.691
Hey, I'm impulsive, too,
so...

01:30.724 --> 01:35.196
Are you, uh -- Are you
gonna stay in California?

01:35.229 --> 01:37.665
I don't know.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.467
I have to get out
of this hotel, though.

01:39.500 --> 01:43.237
The shower sucks,
and I really want a bath.

01:43.271 --> 01:46.207
I took a lot of baths
in Japan.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.876
I love a good bath.

01:48.909 --> 01:52.313
Yeah.

01:52.346 --> 01:56.417
So, no hints
about this game, huh?

01:56.450 --> 01:58.219
[Chuckles]

01:58.252 --> 02:00.754
No. You got to
figure it out yourself.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.591
Oh, but it's so hard.

02:03.624 --> 02:07.195
It is until
you figure it out.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.862
And then it isn't.

02:10.531 --> 02:11.732
[Exhales]

02:18.606 --> 02:20.308
Who was it?

02:20.341 --> 02:22.443
Who was what?

02:22.476 --> 02:26.180
Um,
the woman that Tom...

02:26.214 --> 02:27.648
Oh.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.919
Oh, that's, uh...

02:31.952 --> 02:33.921
[Sighs]

02:33.954 --> 02:38.592
That's the best part.
I never even asked.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.563
Talk to me.
Tell me something.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.597
[Chuckles]

02:43.631 --> 02:45.566
Tell you what?

02:45.599 --> 02:47.735
Just -- I don't know --
anything, life on Earth.

02:47.768 --> 02:48.869
What'd I miss?

02:48.902 --> 02:50.238
Well, what do you
want to hear?

02:50.271 --> 02:53.274
Joe, just talk to me.
Okay.

02:53.307 --> 02:56.577
Uh, did you know that
Bill Clinton is the president?

02:56.610 --> 02:59.480
Yeah.
They love him in Japan.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.581
All those cheeseburgers.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.216
[Chuckles]
So, what else?

03:02.250 --> 03:05.219
Um, the Cowboys won
the Super Bowl.

03:05.253 --> 03:08.722
Audrey Hepburn died.
And so did River Phoenix.

03:08.756 --> 03:12.393
Uh, some crazies tried to
blow up the World Trade Center,

03:12.426 --> 03:16.864
and, uh...you can
be gay in the military,

03:16.897 --> 03:18.466
but nobody
can ask you about it,

03:18.499 --> 03:20.368
and you can't
tell anybody.

03:20.401 --> 03:23.737
Did you know
IBM lost $5 billion?

03:23.771 --> 03:25.273
They check
the couch cushions?

03:25.306 --> 03:26.440
[Chuckles]

03:26.474 --> 03:27.908
You know,
Gordon went through

03:27.941 --> 03:30.644
this whole health phase.

03:30.678 --> 03:34.315
He's got a room in his house
full of gym stuff.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.784
Like, he's got
this NordicTrack

03:36.817 --> 03:38.819
and something called
a ButtMaster, so...

03:38.852 --> 03:40.288
[Chuckles]

03:40.321 --> 03:44.458
And, um, this thing
happened to me.

03:44.492 --> 03:47.361
I was getting out of my car
at a Safeway,

03:47.395 --> 03:51.365
and I saw this woman
flailing her arms, just --

03:51.399 --> 03:53.367
A swarm of bees
was attacking her,

03:53.401 --> 03:55.936
just stinging her
again and again, you know?

03:55.969 --> 03:58.772
And she fell
to the ground.

03:58.806 --> 04:02.543
And out of nowhere,
this ice-cream truck

04:02.576 --> 04:04.445
comes screaming
through the parking lot,

04:04.478 --> 04:08.048
and it's playing that music
from The Sting.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.751
And the guy gets out
of the -- the truck,

04:10.784 --> 04:12.753
and he's doing CPR
and everything.

04:12.786 --> 04:17.758
And the truck is still playing
that tinkling piano music,

04:17.791 --> 04:21.962
and it keeps playing it even
after the ambulance arrives.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.797
And it's all I could
think about for days,

04:23.831 --> 04:28.836
these [chuckles]
paramedics

04:28.869 --> 04:31.539
just working on her like crazy
while this music played

04:31.572 --> 04:34.074
and how that might be
the last thing she ever hears.

04:34.107 --> 04:39.079

what your Hawaiian name is?

[Chuckling] Okay.

It's Kamelonu.

where you --

my Hawaiian name.

so much smaller, doesn't it?

a water slide

Isn't that weird?

You might have already been
on your last water slide.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.620
No way. I always planned
on buying up a water park,

riding the flumes by night.

I've always been a grown up.

sometimes?

you'll be pulling double duty.

is really freaked out

09:55.195 --> 09:57.130
about what happened
on the basketball court,

09:57.164 --> 09:58.766
so she packed up his stuff

09:58.799 --> 10:00.668
and -- and moved him
to Los Angeles,

10:00.701 --> 10:02.670
and he's been living there
ever since.

I'm sorry, but was the thing
on the basketball court

10:04.271 --> 10:05.739
really that big a deal?

insane things

like a giant banana,

haven't eaten in a week.

[Chuckles]

11:24.184 --> 11:27.320
Yeah.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.757
Little Miss Flawless,
1970.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.092
My mom, um,
signed me up for a pageant

11:32.125 --> 11:34.261
after my dad died.

11:34.294 --> 11:37.197
I think she thought
it would distract me

11:37.230 --> 11:40.300
or, uh,
we'd bond or something.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.334
[Chuckles]

11:41.368 --> 11:43.036
And you won.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.338
That time? No.
No, I lost.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.408
But she kept
signing me up.

11:48.441 --> 11:53.313
I told her I hated it,
but she...didn't listen.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.249
That bad, huh?

11:56.283 --> 11:58.919
What, a bunch of 8-year-olds
whitening their teeth

11:58.952 --> 12:00.187
and getting ranked
on their looks?

12:00.220 --> 12:01.254
Yeah, it was that bad.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.489
So, you whitened
your teeth.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.857
Oh, my God.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.926
She had a whole box
of tricks.

12:05.959 --> 12:09.296
Spray adhesive to -- to keep
your bathing suit in place,

12:09.329 --> 12:11.131
uh...
[Gasps]

12:11.164 --> 12:13.500
Oh.
Hemorrhoid cream.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.268
Hemorrhoid cream?
Yeah.

12:15.302 --> 12:19.139
Yeah, 'cause I'd, um, cry a lot?
Before the competitions?

12:19.172 --> 12:20.774
I didn't want to be there.

12:20.808 --> 12:23.811
I just wanted to go home,
and so I'd cry and cry.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.046
And that puffs you up
pretty bad.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.547
So my mom found out that

12:27.580 --> 12:30.183
if you put hemorrhoid cream
all around my eyes,

12:30.217 --> 12:31.819
it took the puffiness away.

12:31.852 --> 12:35.388
So I could be normal again
and march out onstage

12:35.422 --> 12:37.390
and do
the Pretty Feet Pose.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.927
One foot forward,
one foot back,

12:39.960 --> 12:41.461

the rib cage,

12:41.494 --> 12:44.397
big, stupid smile
on my face.

12:44.431 --> 12:49.536
[Chuckling]
And...I'd lose.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.971
Until you won.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.372
Yeah.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.042
Little Miss Flawless,
1970.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.544
Got all those flaws
taken care of.

-Hmm?

13:07.087 --> 13:10.090
A Gavin Greene from Atari
is trying to reach you.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.524
Thank you.

[Door closes]

13:17.297 --> 13:19.299
[Inhales deeply]

13:19.332 --> 13:24.571
So, is there, like,
a Fresh Princess of Bel Air?

13:28.375 --> 13:30.177
Is it dumb to get suspended
for skipping school?

13:30.210 --> 13:31.411
It is, okay?

13:31.444 --> 13:32.980
But we're not here
to debate that.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.514
Okay?
Look, I know what it's like

13:34.547 --> 13:37.150
to have an older sibling who
requires a lot of attention.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.319
Okay, your Uncle Henry?
Total bonehead.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.620
Always getting
into major trouble.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.123
And -- And so, I kind of
flew under the radar.

be dumb about it.

I'm sorry.

-Look --
-I don't...

14:05.913 --> 14:07.347
No, I'm sorry.
Look, it --

Look, it's -- it's not even
that big of a deal.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.250

not even mad.

Ah, hey there, kiddo!

14:16.924 --> 14:18.225
Okay, look,
did I upset you?

Is it something
that I said or...

[Sobs]
No, I'm...

but we're in Three Mile Island

Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.958

I mean, are people
really spending

than twenty-four hours.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.304
So kick 'em off.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.506
We'd have to write
new code to do that

15:06.539 --> 15:08.475
and then get everyone
to download a software patch.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.278
Yeah.
We need more capacity from MCI.

it was that --

that -- that really
intense crying.

start going into convulsions.

Ah, maybe she's just
on her period.

this isn't menstrual crying.

I was this big, fat...

eggheads just come cruising up.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.254

See, these two have a custom
GPS receiver on their boat.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.627
That's the Global Positioning
System.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.296
That is right,
Donna, yeah.

18:16.329 --> 18:20.467
Turns out Fred and Bill
are engineers.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.735

a lot of money

18:22.769 --> 18:25.305

real cheap.

Right.

So we had a few beers,
and we get to talking.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.878
And what we thought was,
why not take their idea

18:31.911 --> 18:33.580
and scale it up?

18:33.613 --> 18:36.449
Make something a guy like me
can buy off the rack?

Uh, doesn't Garmin
already do that?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.521
Mm, yeah,
but them and Magellan

18:41.554 --> 18:42.889
got a stranglehold
on the market,

and, Donna,
they charge up the wazoo.

disrupting the price point,

way down.

-Yes.

my expectations here.

it's intriguing.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.404
Mm.

out of this, Bos?

to be the exec at a startup?

I-I'm just looking for
a finder's fee, you know?

19:39.812 --> 19:42.682

for this kind of thing.

There's a lot of other salty
sailors out there just like me.

Okay. Well, you know,
I'll look into it.

are overdue for a dinner.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.278
We should do that soon.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.246
We should.
Let's do.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.382
**

20:15.415 --> 20:17.484
Let's do.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.352
[Door opens]

20:19.386 --> 20:21.421
Okay.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.556
Okay, I found it.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.626
David was visited by
an exact vision of death:

20:26.659 --> 20:29.796
a long hole in the ground,
no wider than your body,

20:29.829 --> 20:33.766
down which you are drawn while
the white faces above recede.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.803
You try to reach for them,
but your arms are pinned.

20:36.836 --> 20:40.373
Shovels pour dirt
into your face.

20:40.407 --> 20:43.776
There you will be forever,
in an upright position,

20:43.810 --> 20:45.712
blind and silent,

20:45.745 --> 20:48.948
and in time
no one will remember you,

20:48.981 --> 20:51.384
and you will never
be called.

20:51.418 --> 20:54.887
As strata of rock shift,
your fingers elongate,

20:54.921 --> 20:56.923
your teeth
are distended sideways

20:56.956 --> 20:58.858
in a great
underground grimace

20:58.891 --> 21:02.462
indistinguishable
from a strip of chalk.

21:02.495 --> 21:07.534
And the earth tumbles on,
and the sun expires,

21:07.567 --> 21:10.737
and unaltering darkness reigns

21:10.770 --> 21:13.373
[through telephone]
where once there were stars.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.641
Jesus...

21:14.674 --> 21:16.543
But that's not
the end of the story.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.945
This kid --
his grandmother tells him

21:18.978 --> 21:21.614
to go shoot all the pigeons
in the barn.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.350
And it makes him
think about death,

21:23.383 --> 21:25.618
and he has
this crisis of faith.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.620
A-And nobody reassures him.

21:27.654 --> 21:31.524
He is...surrounded
by this non-belief.

21:31.558 --> 21:34.861
It's like a conspiracy,
and he's just wising up to it.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.663
But he still has to shoot
all these pigeons.

21:36.696 --> 21:39.366
And he does, he just shoots
the hell out of them.

21:39.399 --> 21:43.536
And he picks up a dead pigeon,
and he stares at it.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.838
And it's actually gorgeous.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.541
And he decides
right then and there

21:48.575 --> 21:51.644
that no God who would
give so much beauty

21:51.678 --> 21:53.546
to such
a worthless creature

21:53.580 --> 21:57.450
would fail
to let him live forever.

21:57.484 --> 22:01.354
Like his faith
is restored.

22:01.388 --> 22:03.390
Is that
what you believe?

22:03.423 --> 22:04.924
I just -- I don't know.

22:04.957 --> 22:10.763
I guess I...

22:10.797 --> 22:14.601
I hope
there's something more.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.769
Huh.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.905
"Huh" what?

22:18.938 --> 22:20.907
Just weird.
I never thought about you

22:20.940 --> 22:25.044
as the kind of guy
who needed "more."

22:27.146 --> 22:29.616
All right.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.984
What do you believe?

22:32.018 --> 22:36.055
Um, well...

22:36.088 --> 22:38.858
I saw this shrine
in Japan.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.494
And, uh,
the locals tear it down,

22:41.528 --> 22:44.030
right to the foundation,
every 20 years.

22:44.063 --> 22:47.500
And then they build it
right back up again,

22:47.534 --> 22:49.536
back to
its original state.

22:49.569 --> 22:53.072
And they've been doing this
for 1,300 years.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.774
Nothing in it's
original anymore,

22:54.807 --> 22:59.546
but it still looks identical
to the day it went up.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.780
That's beautiful.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.515
Well, no.

23:02.549 --> 23:05.151
I mean, I don't think
these people are doing it

23:05.184 --> 23:07.420
for some
spiritual reason.

23:07.454 --> 23:08.888
I think
they're doing it

23:08.921 --> 23:11.958
because they're holding onto
the process of it, you know?

23:11.991 --> 23:15.928
The doing of it,
that that's all that matters.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.564
That's what I think.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.198
I don't know.

23:19.231 --> 23:23.002
I've been trying to find
some solace in that lately.

23:23.035 --> 23:25.905
How's that
working out for you?

23:25.938 --> 23:28.775
Not that great, Joe,

23:28.808 --> 23:30.477
but thanks for asking.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.579
Um, I'm sorry.

23:32.612 --> 23:36.148
That was --
That was unfair.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.184
[Chuckling]
Yeah, it was.

23:38.217 --> 23:40.086
Look, I'm forty-five.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.489
I've got no family.
I work in a basement.

23:42.522 --> 23:45.692
People aren't exactly lining up
for my spiritual guidance.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.061
Is that
what this is about?

23:49.095 --> 23:50.697
What?

23:50.730 --> 23:54.567
Well, you said
you didn't have a family.

23:54.601 --> 23:57.003
You don't want one,
do you?

23:57.036 --> 23:58.738
[Sighs]

23:58.771 --> 24:00.139
[Horn honks]

24:00.172 --> 24:02.575
My dad died last spring.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.544
Oh, God, Joe.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.579
I'm sorry.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.147
Yeah.

24:08.180 --> 24:12.552
And you know what
this is like, but...

24:12.585 --> 24:15.922
You just start
to think about everything.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.124
And when I was --
when I was fifteen,

24:18.157 --> 24:22.128
I made this vow that
I would never have kids.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.496
All because of him.

24:23.530 --> 24:26.232
He was just...huge

24:26.265 --> 24:29.669
and...imposing.

24:29.702 --> 24:32.605
You know you're huge
and imposing, right?

24:32.639 --> 24:34.807
He made me feel small.

24:34.841 --> 24:37.109
Like I was...

24:37.143 --> 24:38.778
less than nothing.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.981
And I never wanted to risk
doing that to a child.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.551
Uh...

24:47.186 --> 24:49.689
And then he died.

24:49.722 --> 24:55.928
And -- And I'm, like,
there at his funeral.

24:57.296 --> 25:02.602
And there's hardly
anyone else there.

25:02.635 --> 25:07.139
And he felt like the small one
all of a sudden.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.711
And that made you
want to have a family?

25:11.744 --> 25:17.584
It made me realize that
we are different people...

25:17.617 --> 25:21.888
and, um...

25:21.921 --> 25:23.990
maybe I would have
been better.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.168

about kids?

25:36.202 --> 25:38.838
[Sighing]
Yeah.

25:42.809 --> 25:48.648
I just, um,
sprung it on Tom one day.

25:48.681 --> 25:49.982
Didn't even
really think about it.

25:50.016 --> 25:56.088
Just [chuckles]
"Let's start a family."

25:56.122 --> 25:58.024
Such a stupid thing
to say to someone

25:58.057 --> 26:00.593
if you're not ready for them
to take it seriously.

26:00.627 --> 26:01.694
And he did.

26:01.728 --> 26:06.065
Oh, I mean, he lit up.

26:06.098 --> 26:08.868
I've never seen
someone so happy.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.138

26:12.171 --> 26:15.675
And so we, uh,
started trying.

26:15.708 --> 26:20.246

And it didn't work.

26:20.279 --> 26:24.984
And I was relieved.
[Laughs]

26:25.017 --> 26:29.856
I was relieved that
Mother Nature made
a decision for me

26:29.889 --> 26:35.895
that I was too spineless
to make for myself.

26:35.928 --> 26:39.131
And I realized I was
just going through with it

26:39.165 --> 26:41.934
because I didn't want
to disappoint him again.

26:41.968 --> 26:45.772
**

26:45.805 --> 26:49.676
Sorry.
I shouldn't...have said that.

26:53.245 --> 26:57.717
it is so good
to actually talk to you.

I think it's gonna take a while

27:14.333 --> 27:16.068
for me to get used to that.

27:16.102 --> 27:18.170
I mean, come on.
"Aggek"? What is that?

27:18.204 --> 27:20.840
It sounds like
a painful hiccup.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.309
It does kind of remind me
of pond scum.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.845
Oh, God,
Trip makes my blood boil,

once I'm gone,

[Elevator dings]
[Clears throat]

27:43.229 --> 27:45.231
So, how was it?

Be honest.

27:47.967 --> 27:52.438
Oh, well [sighs]
it's a promising arena.

27:52.471 --> 27:54.874
But I think
they're too late.

27:54.907 --> 27:57.309
There's a lot of muscle
in GPS already,

27:57.343 --> 28:01.047
and retail is tricky.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.414
But I can do
some more digging,

28:02.448 --> 28:04.283
maybe order up
an analysis.

28:04.316 --> 28:05.785
No.

28:05.818 --> 28:08.721
I think John could care less
about GPS.

Let's circle back
on that later.
Oh, really?

28:25.504 --> 28:28.074
I think now's the perfect time
to drill down on it.

to drill down

Hey.

Um...they're, uh...

31:23.415 --> 31:26.452
They're gonna
delay my game.

31:26.485 --> 31:29.922

indefinitely.

31:33.259 --> 31:37.429
Uh, they need some
press-release quote from me,

31:37.463 --> 31:39.665
so I -- I should
probably go.

31:39.698 --> 31:41.567

barges in room, right?
Yeah, yeah. [Laughs]

32:24.576 --> 32:26.112
Mm.

32:26.145 --> 32:27.446
I've got
a lot to say,

32:27.479 --> 32:28.647
but I don't want
to ruin good champagne

Trip: I'm honored.

32:34.753 --> 32:37.023
I'm humbled.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.590
And I'm ready.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.392
I am.

32:40.426 --> 32:43.695
I'm ready to really drill down
on monetizing my portfolio

32:43.729 --> 32:47.599
while simultaneously cultivating
new and promising ventures

32:47.633 --> 32:49.568
that provide big exits,

32:49.601 --> 32:54.740
with LP's clamoring
to sign subscription docs.

32:54.773 --> 32:57.443
So, thank you,
one and all.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.045
[Glasses clink]
Thank you.

32:59.078 --> 33:00.679
Elias: All right, fun's over.
Back to business.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.581
-Yeah. Let's do it.
-Come on.

33:07.253 --> 33:09.288
SparqPlug's Series B
term sheet draft

33:09.321 --> 33:11.357

for the curious.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.293
Joyce, can you send around
the target for PulseMD?

33:14.326 --> 33:15.461
Got it.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.063
And Millennium
is a write-down.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.630
Let's take a knee on the web
for now, yes?

33:18.664 --> 33:20.332
Actually, no.

33:20.366 --> 33:23.635
Uh, Rover is repurposing
their software for a web play.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.604
They're getting set up
in the Incubator now.

33:28.074 --> 33:30.042
And you're still
on point, Donna?

33:30.076 --> 33:31.643
I made
Tanya Reese associate.

33:31.677 --> 33:35.247
She'll take lead and
have an update by end of day.

33:35.281 --> 33:39.718
Um, just to throw out
a quick suggestion --

33:39.751 --> 33:43.322
Rover has enough runway
to rework their core technology

33:43.355 --> 33:46.292
and index the entire web,
make it searchable.

33:46.325 --> 33:48.160
It's low-risk,
high-reward.

33:48.194 --> 33:51.130
Uh, sorry, I'm -- I'm
just getting caught up
on the particulars,

33:51.163 --> 33:53.732
but seeing as the web
is rocky territory,

33:53.765 --> 33:55.834
is -- is jumping back into
browsers maybe something --

33:55.867 --> 33:57.536
Rover isn't developing
a browser.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.571
It's indexing the web.

33:59.605 --> 34:01.440
The whole thing.
[Chuckles]

34:01.473 --> 34:05.111
Uh, could -- could we
circle back for a second

34:05.144 --> 34:06.478
and drill down
on leadership?

34:06.512 --> 34:08.647
So, Tanya Reese was
an assistant of yours

34:08.680 --> 34:10.249
until today?

34:10.282 --> 34:12.251
We're all aware
of that fact, Trip.

34:12.284 --> 34:13.585
Absolutely.

34:13.619 --> 34:16.155
I'm just -- just
getting up on my skis here,

34:16.188 --> 34:19.625
but, um, does she have
a web background

34:19.658 --> 34:23.129
or any managerial experience
specific to this play?

34:23.162 --> 34:27.099
Tanya sat on my desk
for two years.

34:27.133 --> 34:29.835
She's been involved
in numerous deals

34:29.868 --> 34:33.239
and consequential in the success
of more than a few.

34:33.272 --> 34:35.241
Not to mention the fact

34:35.274 --> 34:38.210
that she pulled Rover
off the slush pile
to begin with, so...

34:38.244 --> 34:40.779
Gilson: Just, um,
talking while I'm thinking,

34:40.812 --> 34:45.317
uh, but since the web
is frontierland,

34:45.351 --> 34:46.552
would it be
the worst idea

34:46.585 --> 34:48.654
to bring in
an outside consultant?

34:48.687 --> 34:50.189
I think Tanya
is perfectly capable

34:50.222 --> 34:51.690
of handling
the challenge --

34:51.723 --> 34:53.192
Elias: I bet Joey Winchester'd
be happy to come in.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.527
You know who's available
is Michael Hottendorf.

34:55.561 --> 34:58.197
Trip: Cass Reinhardt just exited
Sequoia three months ago...
Ooh.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.865
...and he would hit this
out of the park.

34:59.898 --> 35:01.200
-Cass --
-You know what?

35:01.233 --> 35:02.534
If that's
what Rover needs,

35:02.568 --> 35:04.670
I have the perfect person
in mind.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.407
Let me just, uh,
make a phone call,

35:08.440 --> 35:09.908
and I'll report back.

Hmm, okay, moving on,

by a bit.

35:21.287 --> 35:22.288

two percent of our load.

35:23.755 --> 35:25.324
Oh,
that's a drop in the bucket --

35:25.357 --> 35:26.492
we're getting hit in the face
with a fire hose.

what are you doing here?

we're going through
a couple hiccups today.

bucket brigade routine.

uh -- their blue?
Hey, listen,

36:23.949 --> 36:26.785
uh, Bos, m-maybe today's
not a good time.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.654
Can we grab a drink
in a few days or something?

36:28.687 --> 36:33.259
Yeah, yeah, but --
um, hey, uh...

36:33.292 --> 36:34.960
[Snaps fingers]
Gordon,

36:34.993 --> 36:39.798
I need to, uh --
I need to borrow some money.

36:39.831 --> 36:42.268
Diane and I were
looking to invest

36:42.301 --> 36:44.236
in this
housing development.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.804
She lost interest.
And I didn't.

36:45.837 --> 36:47.939
Uh, so I put up
my own money,

36:47.973 --> 36:50.276
uh,
without telling her.

36:50.309 --> 36:53.011
[Chuckling] And then
I went in whole hog.

36:53.044 --> 36:56.715
So, you know,
I-I put good money after bad

36:56.748 --> 36:59.718
and bad money after worse,
and before you --

36:59.751 --> 37:01.453
Well,
now I'm in the drink.

in a week.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.325

why don't you ask Diane?

37:06.358 --> 37:07.493
I mean, she's your wife.

37:07.526 --> 37:08.794
W-Well,
she's not my wife.

for the kids.

to pay this thing down.

how short are you?

coming to me?

37:37.823 --> 37:40.659
Well, now, don't worry,
I'm -- I'm good for it.
I'm good for it.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.495
No, I got this -- this GPS thing
that I'm working on.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.664
And then I got, uh --

37:45.697 --> 37:49.301
Oh, God, I got so much stuff
in the hopper right now, really.

37:49.335 --> 37:51.403
I mean, I'm -- I'm just --
I'm just cash-shy,

37:51.437 --> 37:52.804
just a little cash-shy.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.673
So I figured
you had a --

37:54.706 --> 37:57.309
You figured that...

37:57.343 --> 37:59.010
since I hired
the Blue Man Group

37:59.044 --> 38:03.882
that I must have cash just
falling out of my pockets?

38:03.915 --> 38:07.819
Look, Bos, look, I'd give you
the money in a heartbeat.

38:07.853 --> 38:10.889
But you live with Diane,
who works with my ex-wife.

38:10.922 --> 38:14.460
And who has more money than
all of us combined, all right?

38:14.493 --> 38:16.995
I can't get in the middle
of that.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.664

41:07.232 --> 41:11.770
Not like it's C++
or anything.

41:11.803 --> 41:15.574
That pony is dressed
like a little pink cowboy.

41:15.607 --> 41:18.209
It's actually a miniature horse.
So it's way cooler.

41:18.243 --> 41:19.778
Ah.

41:19.811 --> 41:24.950
[Mouse clicking]

Jon Volpi.
On the phone.

41:30.288 --> 41:31.557
All right, Shep.

41:31.590 --> 41:32.758
Is rad.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.225
-"Rad"?
-Rad.

41:34.259 --> 41:37.295
This is...rad, yes.

Joe: [Through telephone]
You ready?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.168
Cameron:
Yes. Go ahead.

41:43.201 --> 41:44.903
Okay, okay, okay.

41:44.936 --> 41:47.706
"A game of this scope
can't be rushed.

41:47.739 --> 41:50.909
The Atari team and I have forged
a fruitful working relationship

41:50.942 --> 41:52.177
that will continue
to deliver

41:52.210 --> 41:54.012
the engrossing
gaming experience...

41:54.045 --> 41:56.848
[Blows]
...our fans demand
and deserve.

41:56.882 --> 41:59.618
I am gratified by Atari's
commitment to the title

41:59.651 --> 42:01.920
and look forward
to our ongoing collaboration.

42:01.953 --> 42:03.989
In addition, I firmly deny

42:04.022 --> 42:06.758
that I have an urgent desire
to scalp Gavin Greene,

42:06.792 --> 42:10.261
scoop out his brain,
and shit in his empty skull.

42:10.295 --> 42:12.063
[Laughs]

42:12.097 --> 42:15.233
Yes!

42:15.266 --> 42:16.868
I think
we should send it.

42:16.902 --> 42:21.573
I mean, minus the, uh --
the last part, unfortunately.

42:21.607 --> 42:25.010
Listen, I know -- I know it's
hard to swallow this right now,

42:25.043 --> 42:27.312
but you are so good
at what you do.

[Chuckles]
Joe --

42:28.680 --> 42:30.015
No, really.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.117
Don't let that asshole
take that away from you.

42:32.150 --> 42:34.185
He's a parasite.
You create.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.287
You make something
out of nothing,

42:36.321 --> 42:39.925
and I have always been
in awe of that.

42:41.827 --> 42:44.763
And not to ruin
the moment,

42:44.796 --> 42:45.931
but I really,
really got to piss.

42:45.964 --> 42:47.232
Oh, my God, me too.
Okay.

42:48.333 --> 42:50.001
[Receiver rattles]

42:50.035 --> 42:52.671
Yes, Jon,
we understand that part, okay,

42:52.704 --> 42:54.139
but our trunk lines
are totally clogged over here.

42:54.172 --> 42:56.207
Now, we had a contract
that specifically --

42:56.241 --> 42:57.275
Jon Volpi:
[Over speakerphone] And we'll
uphold that contract...

42:57.308 --> 42:58.644
but that contract doesn't

42:58.677 --> 43:01.079
explicitly codify
expansion.

43:01.112 --> 43:04.182
Uh, Jon, Shep Gramaticus, here,
VP of Ops.

43:04.215 --> 43:06.217
Uh, if this is a rate issue,
let's talk rates.

43:06.251 --> 43:07.385
We want to engage.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.020
It's crowded out there,
Shep.

43:09.054 --> 43:11.757
Only so much bandwidth
in the ISP market.

43:11.790 --> 43:14.225
Can't really say there's pipe
just laying around for you.

43:14.259 --> 43:15.894
Look, we get it.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.162
We'll break
our rate lock.
No.

43:17.195 --> 43:19.297
Look, Jon, just level with us,
all right?

43:19.330 --> 43:21.032
What do we got to pay?

43:21.066 --> 43:23.869
Guys, I'm afraid you're
not hearing what I'm saying.

43:23.902 --> 43:27.305
There is no more pipe. For you.
Period.

43:27.338 --> 43:29.841
And if you gentlemen
need anything else,

43:29.875 --> 43:31.777
Barry Schnellham
is your guy.

43:31.810 --> 43:33.645
Take care, now.

Man #1: Are we an ISP
with no backbone?

43:35.346 --> 43:37.082
Man #2: We're already
hemorrhaging customers.

Be dead before
we switch providers.

43:42.287 --> 43:44.923
[Shakily] They're starting
their own ISP.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.257
Oh, my God.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.392
Shep: We need to retain
outside counsel.

43:47.425 --> 43:48.894
[Sighs]
They can't do this.

43:48.927 --> 43:50.095
They're a public utility.

43:50.128 --> 43:51.830
They cannot
pick winners and losers.

We got to do something.

is blocking it.
