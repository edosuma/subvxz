You're gonna owe
me one, Cherise.

01:02.614 --> 01:04.449
Looks like a dead end here.

01:05.575 --> 01:06.702
Let's pack it up.

01:18.296 --> 01:20.505
Whoa, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

01:20.507 --> 01:22.549
What's that?

01:22.551 --> 01:23.803
12 o'clock.

01:25.055 --> 01:26.722
We've got active fumaroles

01:26.724 --> 01:28.348
and volcanic debris on
the sea floor.

01:28.350 --> 01:29.808
Ford was right.

01:29.810 --> 01:32.145
Take us forward 20 degrees.

01:35.691 --> 01:37.648
Ford's live right now.

01:37.650 --> 01:40.568
How would you categorize
putting 500-ton machines

01:40.570 --> 01:42.946
on the seabed, digging
and tearing up the sea bottom,

01:42.948 --> 01:45.240
obliterating everything
in their path

01:45.242 --> 01:47.616
to obtain a small amount
of minerals and metals?

01:47.618 --> 01:49.578
It's not a small amount.

01:49.580 --> 01:50.912
What about the sea life?

01:50.914 --> 01:52.622
From what I understand,
the metals you seek

01:52.624 --> 01:56.001
are found on volcanic sea
mounts and hydrothermal vents,

01:56.003 --> 01:58.212
hot spots for hundreds
of life forms,

01:58.214 --> 02:00.006
many of which are
completely new to science

02:00.008 --> 02:01.381
and exist nowhere else,

02:01.383 --> 02:04.509
life forms that may vanish
before we even identify

02:04.511 --> 02:06.971
what they are if your mining
is allowed to go forward.

02:06.973 --> 02:09.347
On the contrary,
we're ideally situated

02:09.348 --> 02:11.977
to allow for the discovery
of new life forms.

02:11.979 --> 02:13.645
Take us over that ridge.

02:13.647 --> 02:16.189
Your detractors say
you are planning to tear apart

02:16.191 --> 02:18.817
unique marine environments
that exist nowhere else.

to continue using technology

Look at that.

02:31.123 --> 02:34.457
Polymetallic nodules,
hundreds of them.

02:34.459 --> 02:37.712
Not all nodules
contain manganese.

02:37.714 --> 02:39.505
Ones on volcanoes do.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.925
Let's do what
we came here for.

02:41.927 --> 02:43.384
Collect a sample.

02:43.386 --> 02:45.260
We only have permission
to survey.

02:45.262 --> 02:47.222
Come on.
You know what Ford would say.

02:47.224 --> 02:49.682
"Rather ask for forgiveness
than for permission."

02:49.684 --> 02:50.808
But we're not him.

02:50.810 --> 02:52.976
Riley, you know the next step

02:52.978 --> 02:55.188
will be to collect
a sample, okay?

02:55.190 --> 02:56.730
And permitting
is gonna take weeks!

02:56.732 --> 02:59.234
I mean, why go through all
that if this claim is a dud?

02:59.236 --> 03:02.570

some of that nugget!

this part of the ocean

03:45.783 --> 03:48.202
needs to be left alone.

We've lost contact.

to our remote operating facility

03:54.169 --> 03:55.584
to take a look at
the ocean floor

03:55.586 --> 03:57.627

been done before.

pushed boundaries on land.

- I'm still on the call.
- Of course.

04:15.148 --> 04:17.982
So this kind of mining,
it can be done remotely?

04:17.983 --> 04:19.274
That's right.

to surface buoys

to run one of our machines.

Now there's gonna be about
a one minute delay.

a feed from one of our relays.

04:57.234 --> 04:58.942
- Sir?
- Yeah?

- But I went along with it.

Yeah, but you didn't want to.

You didn't exactly
put a gun to my head.

any ideas, Riley.

05:59.923 --> 06:01.923

Riley, you're new, but, Cherise,

can pay me back in installments.

This 500-ton and billion dollar
robot was apparently surveying

06:50.643 --> 06:54.312
an unexplored region of
the Pacific when it vanished.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.480
International
environmental authorities,

06:56.482 --> 06:59.693
including the ISA,
are looking into his operations.

06:59.695 --> 07:02.029
And experts indicate this
could be a death blow

07:02.031 --> 07:05.618
for Benthic Prospecting and
its dreams of mining the deep.

07:18.005 --> 07:22.633
I tried chasing her away, but
she has these official papers.

07:22.635 --> 07:24.595
What type of papers,
good papers?

07:26.472 --> 07:28.682
Billy, it's not a bad thing
we an extra woman on the vessel.

My job is,
by government mandate,

07:47.954 --> 07:49.870
to ensure that
environmental regulations are

07:49.872 --> 07:52.041
upheld on any maritime

08:02.552 --> 08:04.719
Get your office to call mine
and we can set up an appointment

08:04.721 --> 08:08.055
to discuss future
Benthic Prospecting operations.

08:08.057 --> 08:10.515
Mr. Ford, I am authorized
to inform you that,

08:10.517 --> 08:12.393
by refusing
a government observer,

08:12.395 --> 08:14.480
you and your company
are subject to fines.

08:14.482 --> 08:15.814
We'll pay the fine.

08:15.816 --> 08:18.025
Fines and/or government
impoundment of your vessel

08:18.027 --> 08:19.984
and equipment,

08:19.986 --> 08:21.235
not to mention any
future applications

08:21.237 --> 08:22.989
will be heavily scrutinized.

08:24.366 --> 08:26.657
I see that you have a permit
for geological survey

08:26.659 --> 08:29.037
and your mining permit
is still under review.

08:31.623 --> 08:32.917
Correct.

08:34.751 --> 08:36.876
Your cooperation
with the ISA

08:36.879 --> 08:38.587
is one of the conditions
of the permit.

08:38.590 --> 08:41.465
And this includes an onboard
environmental observer.

08:41.467 --> 08:44.260
Like I said, this isn't
a mining expedition!

08:45.388 --> 08:48.263
One last thing.
I'm curious.

08:48.265 --> 08:50.016
How did you identify
the Kermadec Trench

08:50.018 --> 08:51.144
as a source for mining?

08:53.145 --> 08:56.105
All right, answer me this.

08:56.107 --> 08:59.483
As a member of the ISA,
can you tell me who else,

08:59.485 --> 09:02.404
what companies, nations,
other interested parties,

09:02.406 --> 09:04.447
might have been looking
at claims on that area

09:04.449 --> 09:05.699
of the sea floor?

09:05.701 --> 09:08.244
I can do that.

09:08.246 --> 09:11.080
Well, in that case,
welcome to Benthic Prospecting.

09:11.082 --> 09:13.873
I can assure you my team
follow all maritime rules.

09:13.875 --> 09:16.960
We're groundbreakers,
not lawbreakers, Miss Murray.

09:16.962 --> 09:18.130
Ms.

09:21.384 --> 09:24.970
Well, according to
our records, your company is

09:24.972 --> 09:28.014
the only one who's applied for
a permit to survey that area.

09:28.016 --> 09:29.601
It's kind of off the radar.

09:32.146 --> 09:33.769
I'm curious.

09:33.771 --> 09:36.148
What brought you
into this field?

09:36.150 --> 09:39.484
Marine environmental observer?

09:39.486 --> 09:40.818
Can't be the pay.

09:40.820 --> 09:43.404
Unfortunately, not.

09:43.406 --> 09:44.947
Frankly, there weren't
a ton of jobs

09:44.949 --> 09:46.991
for a graduate with
a degree in geomythology

09:46.993 --> 09:49.828
that didn't involve
sitting at a desk.

09:49.830 --> 09:50.998
Do you know what that is?

09:52.459 --> 09:54.792
It's a wooden platform
with four legs, isn't it?

09:54.794 --> 09:56.001
You put things on it.

09:56.003 --> 09:57.919
Very funny, Mr. Ford.

09:57.921 --> 09:59.380
I know.

09:59.382 --> 10:01.340
Yes, Ms. Murray,
I know what it is.

10:01.342 --> 10:04.802
The use of stories and myths
to corroborate natural disasters

10:04.804 --> 10:07.013
in the historic record.

10:07.015 --> 10:09.015
That's right.

10:09.017 --> 10:12.519
I told you my team and I use
every resource to our advantage.

10:12.521 --> 10:16.147
If a geomythology treatise
proposes an eruption in an area

10:16.149 --> 10:18.858
without previous
volcanic activity,

10:18.860 --> 10:20.819
we take notice.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.031
I'm impressed.

10:28.204 --> 10:30.703
Would you like me
to leave the room?

10:30.705 --> 10:33.042
[CHUCKLES]

10:42.969 --> 10:44.221
How far are we?

10:45.806 --> 10:49.181
We'll be approaching
the coordinates shortly.

10:49.183 --> 10:51.517
How's the prep going
on the R.O.V., Riley?

10:51.519 --> 10:53.730
Ready to deploy at
your command, sir.

10:55.148 --> 10:58.233
Okay, let's take
a look at this terrain.

10:58.235 --> 11:00.654
Initiating sonar scan.

11:02.323 --> 11:05.076
What was the source that
led you to survey this area?

11:06.034 --> 11:07.743
Subsonic tremor.

11:07.745 --> 11:10.204
After the one at Madagascar,
we started keeping our eyes out

11:10.206 --> 11:11.622
for something similar.

11:11.624 --> 11:14.124
That turned out to be an
underground magma chamber

11:14.126 --> 11:16.418
collapsing and emptying out.

11:16.420 --> 11:19.879
That brought us on to look for
other similar unrecorded events.

11:19.881 --> 11:23.634
We started picking up signals
from the Kermadec Trench.

11:23.636 --> 11:26.429
Turns out they'd been there
all along, just no one had ever

11:26.431 --> 11:29.640
noticed because the frequency
of vibration was too low.

11:29.642 --> 11:32.686
Oh, there's no telling what
you can find out there.

11:32.688 --> 11:35.272
I've been out at sea
for 20 years

11:35.274 --> 11:38.399
and I'm still surprised.

11:38.401 --> 11:41.445
St. Elmo's Fire, Fata Morgana,
Phantom Islands.

11:41.447 --> 11:43.487
We know more about
the surface of Venus

11:43.489 --> 11:45.615
than we know about
our own the ocean floor.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.784
Maybe we should be looking
there for the Digger.

11:47.786 --> 11:49.998
- What?
- Nothing.

11:51.583 --> 11:54.125
Okay, we're coming up to
the area where we lost contact

11:54.127 --> 11:55.545
with the Deep Digger Rig.

11:59.424 --> 12:00.839
Can you enhance the view?

12:00.841 --> 12:02.341
From this distance,
we wouldn't be able

12:02.343 --> 12:03.634
to make out the Digger.

12:03.636 --> 12:05.764
I know.
Look at the sea floor.

12:07.474 --> 12:09.097
What do you see?

12:09.099 --> 12:10.308
The caldera?

12:10.310 --> 12:11.894
Look again.

12:11.896 --> 12:14.896
These readings show massive
surface subsidence and erosion.

12:14.898 --> 12:18.983
Something's taken off the
top third of this volcano.

12:18.985 --> 12:20.819
What kind of
mining rig can do that?

12:20.821 --> 12:22.654
That wouldn't
be corporate-owned.

12:22.656 --> 12:25.073
Something that size
would be state-sponsored.

12:25.075 --> 12:27.742
Chinese or Canadian?

12:27.744 --> 12:28.910
Or the CIA?

12:28.912 --> 12:32.039
Ah, so you know about
the Glomar expedition.

12:32.041 --> 12:33.040
I like you.

12:33.042 --> 12:34.916
Project Azorian.

12:34.918 --> 12:39.046
Everyone in ocean mining worth
their salt knows about that.

12:39.048 --> 12:40.924
Said they were looking
for manganese.

12:40.926 --> 12:46.012
Turns out they were bringing up
nukes from a sunken Russian sub.

12:46.014 --> 12:47.555
No, that wasn't nukes.

12:47.557 --> 12:50.016
You've seen the film,
"The Abyss"?

12:50.018 --> 12:51.684
Based on a true story.

12:51.686 --> 12:53.103
Oh, come on.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.021
No, it's true, really.

12:55.023 --> 12:57.274
They are down there.

12:59.027 --> 13:01.528
Something is there.

13:01.530 --> 13:04.864
You sure no one else has
applied to mine this region?

13:04.866 --> 13:06.116
Nothing on our books.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.619
Well, it wouldn't be,
would it?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.664
I mean, look at the scope
of that destruction.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.542
I'd say they bypassed the mining
regulations altogether.

13:15.544 --> 13:18.546
Let's scrap the R.O.V.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.380
We need to get down there
and check this out ourselves.

13:20.382 --> 13:22.717
Prepare the submersible.

13:25.055 --> 13:29.140
Sir, under the circumstances,
I would suggest using the R.O.V.

13:29.142 --> 13:33.019
It's much safer, sir.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.813
I want to check this out
with our own eyes.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.234
Yeah, I feel it's my duty
to inform you.

13:39.236 --> 13:43.404
Riley, if you want to stay
on the surface, that's okay.

13:43.406 --> 13:46.575
No, sir, I'm...
I'm with you.

13:46.577 --> 13:50.538
- Cherise?
- I'm in.

13:50.540 --> 13:53.583
Ms. Murray, hope you
don't get claustrophobic.

13:53.585 --> 13:55.378
All right, let's get
this show on the road!

14:01.718 --> 14:02.926
Au revoir.

14:17.109 --> 14:18.402
All-righty.

14:38.130 --> 14:40.632
Okay, Captain, lower us in.

14:40.634 --> 14:43.887
Aye, aye, sir.
We are dropping you in.

14:55.774 --> 14:58.358
How deep we
going today, Cherise?

14:58.360 --> 15:00.443
3400 meters.

15:00.445 --> 15:02.946
How deep have you gone
before in this thing?

15:02.948 --> 15:04.449
3000 meters.

15:05.785 --> 15:07.909
But it's been
tested way beyond spec.

15:07.911 --> 15:09.994
This thing's designed
to take the pressure

15:09.996 --> 15:11.831
at at least 4000 meters.

15:11.833 --> 15:14.249
We could run into a mountain
and still be okay,

15:14.251 --> 15:17.168
not that I'm planning on
running into any mountains.

15:17.170 --> 15:19.504
And we can communicate
with the surface

15:19.506 --> 15:21.507
if you fancy ordering a pizza.

15:21.509 --> 15:22.758
I'm vegan.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.846
- Oh, you and Cherise both!
- Oh.

15:25.848 --> 15:28.014
Welp, vegan pizza,
we can't do,

15:28.016 --> 15:30.183
but we can...

15:30.185 --> 15:32.476
Oh, someone's beaten me to it.

15:32.478 --> 15:35.020
Normally we have
some vegan cheese.

15:35.022 --> 15:38.066
I've had a few problems with
milk products onboard.

15:38.068 --> 15:40.067
It's not the milk or the cheese
that's the problem.

15:40.069 --> 15:41.361
It's the after-effects.

15:41.363 --> 15:42.361
You know, ventilation's
a problem...

15:42.363 --> 15:43.697
Yeah, I get it.

15:43.699 --> 15:45.030
You ever heard of
the Cheetos incident?

15:45.032 --> 15:46.408
- No.
- On the shuttle?

15:46.410 --> 15:47.868
Really bad.

15:47.870 --> 15:51.079
Almost took out the entire
air ventilation system.

15:51.081 --> 15:52.539
Not good if you're in space.

15:52.541 --> 15:54.710
Should be getting
a reading now.

15:56.128 --> 15:58.254
Any sign of the Deep Digger?

15:58.256 --> 15:59.796
Negative.

15:59.798 --> 16:02.050
I am getting something
weird, though.

16:03.677 --> 16:06.429
When we were surveying the area,

16:06.431 --> 16:11.058
it was covered in
polymetallic nodules.

16:11.060 --> 16:12.605
Now they're gone.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.983
The entire topography
is different.

16:18.193 --> 16:21.279
If it isn't a rival mining
conglomerate, then...

16:23.532 --> 16:24.742
what is it?

16:26.409 --> 16:27.911
Go in for a closer look.

16:34.417 --> 16:36.252
See there?

16:36.254 --> 16:39.671
The entire surface of the seabed
has been scraped away.

16:39.673 --> 16:41.215
What's that?

16:41.217 --> 16:43.258
I don't know.

16:43.260 --> 16:44.721
That ridge was not there before.

16:46.640 --> 16:48.973
Is it volcanic?

16:48.975 --> 16:51.100
Hey, is it safe to be going
in this close?

16:51.102 --> 16:52.936
I was about
to ask the same question.

16:52.938 --> 16:55.941
I'm not picking up
any volcanic activity.

16:56.774 --> 16:58.400
Anything coming up on the lidar?

16:59.487 --> 17:00.987
Image coming in now.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.825
Surface is hardened
volcanic silica.

17:10.288 --> 17:11.748
Move in for a closer look.

17:14.377 --> 17:15.627
Okay.

17:22.134 --> 17:24.470
I wanna get some
still shots of that.

17:26.722 --> 17:28.142
Activating the forward lights.

17:34.730 --> 17:36.773
- Oh!
- We've been hit!

17:36.775 --> 17:39.109
- Hang on!
- What is this?

17:39.111 --> 17:41.611
Riley! Full throttle!
We gotta get clear of this!

17:41.613 --> 17:43.612
I'm giving it all we got!

17:43.614 --> 17:45.072
We're stuck!

17:45.074 --> 17:46.908
The momentum is too strong
for us to break free!

17:46.910 --> 17:48.827
We gotta keep trying!
Use full thrusters!

17:48.829 --> 17:50.914
The motors are gonna blow!

17:52.416 --> 17:54.668
Okay, okay, you're right!
Shut it off! Shut it off!

17:55.752 --> 17:57.335
Our rate of ascension
is increasing!

17:57.337 --> 17:58.795
I thought you said there
was no one else down here!

17:58.797 --> 18:00.214
I didn't say that!

18:00.216 --> 18:01.798
I said there were no other
mining applications!

18:01.800 --> 18:03.092
Looks like someone
missed something!

18:03.094 --> 18:05.385
I don't think
this is a mining rig!

18:05.387 --> 18:08.766
We're heading for the surface!
Everyone hang on!

18:38.214 --> 18:39.965
Wh-wh-what is that?

18:43.720 --> 18:45.055
The Captain was right.

18:48.183 --> 18:49.390
They're here!

18:49.392 --> 18:52.729
No, no, that's not it.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.741
That's a Kaiju!

19:26.306 --> 19:27.558
What did you say?

19:29.560 --> 19:34.231
"Born of fire from the sea".

19:37.775 --> 19:41.737
Indigenous lore tells of
a giant creature...

19:43.573 --> 19:47.536
born of fire,
a volcano...

coming from the sea.

19:52.375 --> 19:53.749
We gotta get
off this thing.

We gotta get off this!

Ford, come in!

20:14.273 --> 20:15.563
We read you, Captain.

20:15.565 --> 20:18.024
We are having
a close encounter with...

20:18.026 --> 20:21.695
I don't know what this is.
Are you reading this?

20:21.697 --> 20:24.114
I doubt
it's closer than ours.

20:24.116 --> 20:25.573
We're stuck right on top of it.

20:25.575 --> 20:27.285
Do you see us?

20:28.495 --> 20:30.829
I see you.

20:30.831 --> 20:32.875
What the hell are
you doing there?

20:34.878 --> 20:37.214
I do not have
a good answer to that.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.924
Can you communicate with them?

20:40.926 --> 20:43.342
It's not a "them".

20:43.344 --> 20:47.179
Our scans indicate
it's a single life form.

20:47.181 --> 20:50.100
Kaiju?

20:50.102 --> 20:51.018
Yeah.

20:52.521 --> 20:54.020
We're wedged in pretty good.

20:54.022 --> 20:56.650
But I think if it submerges,
we can float free.

21:00.362 --> 21:01.697
Something's happening!

21:06.619 --> 21:08.286
That's not good.

21:19.381 --> 21:21.756
Captain! You will not be able
to outrun that thing!

21:21.758 --> 21:23.301
I know.

21:23.303 --> 21:25.887
If that thing hits you
broadside, you'll capsize!

21:25.889 --> 21:27.181
Not on my watch.

21:29.267 --> 21:31.269
Prepare for impact!

21:49.247 --> 21:52.832
If it does that again, I don't
think we're going to make it.

to get safe!

like when it hits land.

I expect it to impact
the land in one hour.

22:29.121 --> 22:30.996
Uh, copy that,
Benthic Explorer.

22:30.998 --> 22:32.623
Is that a rogue wave?

22:32.625 --> 22:35.375
We don't have any seismic
activity in your position.

22:35.377 --> 22:37.586
Negative.
It is something different.

22:37.588 --> 22:39.588
Listen carefully.

22:39.590 --> 22:43.260
Something alive and very large
is headed for the coast.

22:44.805 --> 22:47.012

life form not seen before,

22:50.769 --> 22:53.769
a Kaiju, is headed
for the coast.

Is this a joke?

22:55.816 --> 22:57.440
I wish it were.

22:57.442 --> 23:00.152
Can you get General Horne of the
Coast Guard to radio us back?

23:00.154 --> 23:02.363
We supply tech for
his research vessels.

23:02.365 --> 23:05.031
If this Kaiju carries on
at its current rate,

23:05.033 --> 23:07.660
it'll make landfall
in four or five hours.

23:07.662 --> 23:09.202
Sound the tsunami warning

23:09.204 --> 23:11.454
and get General Horne
to call us back.

23:11.456 --> 23:12.958

Tell the FAC they'll be
getting their feet wet.

eyes on this.

23:51.957 --> 23:53.208
- Yes, sir.
- Pronto.

23:56.963 --> 23:59.382
Power is at 85%.

Oxygen depletion rate is high.

24:02.927 --> 24:04.886
We're not gonna last long
at this rate.

24:04.888 --> 24:07.888
- How long we got?
- 45 minutes.

Oh, we're stuck
on top of a Kaiju

24:09.475 --> 24:11.352

out of oxygen!

24:13.062 --> 24:15.647

again with the top hatch open,

24:25.493 --> 24:27.074
it will flood the chamber.

out of oxygen

to be flooded.

It seems to have a hide made out
of some kind of volcanic silica.

35:35.399 --> 35:38.149

this results in an upwelling

to describe natural disasters.

Kaijus similar to this one?

38:11.102 --> 38:14.395

were not really deemed

38:14.397 --> 38:16.939

Rena Hangaroa.

driven from academia.

is the only living person

challenged her theories.

39:08.829 --> 39:10.995
I contradicted her in my thesis.

39:10.997 --> 39:15.167
I thought that her classes
were wasting my tuition.

39:15.169 --> 39:18.169
I didn't go to university
to learn about monsters.

39:18.171 --> 39:19.923
I didn't see any point in that.

39:21.675 --> 39:23.845

I'm afraid I was the straw
that broke the camel's back.

which led to a landslide.

I might be in Fiji with
big bottom girls.

40:39.673 --> 40:41.133
[CHUCKLES]

40:43.302 --> 40:45.221
- Good luck, my friend.
- Merci.

40:46.597 --> 40:48.141
Hey, Sam, crazy legs.

41:10.455 --> 41:12.873
Based on my estimate of
the size of the Kaiju

41:12.875 --> 41:14.207
and the amount of
destruction left behind

41:14.209 --> 41:17.127
on the sea floor caldera,
this life form

41:17.129 --> 41:19.295
has tremendous energy
requirements to sustain it.

41:19.297 --> 41:22.300
I mean, I'm talking several
million kilojoules of energy

41:22.302 --> 41:24.094
just to maintain
its metabolism.

41:24.096 --> 41:26.220
Based on its size and
its energy requirements,

41:26.222 --> 41:28.222
I believe it's seeking
a new place to feed.

41:28.224 --> 41:30.224
And it feeds on volcanoes?

41:30.226 --> 41:32.309
Or the byproducts
of volcanoes, yeah.

41:32.311 --> 41:35.146
So where's the nearest volcano?

41:35.148 --> 41:36.815
I'll have to do an analysis.

41:36.817 --> 41:39.275
The sea floor here is home
to the greatest concentration

41:39.277 --> 41:40.693
of submarine volcanoes
in the world.

41:40.695 --> 41:43.822
What if it's not going
somewhere to feed?

41:43.824 --> 41:45.532
We have no idea
what its motivation is.

41:45.534 --> 41:47.660
I don't have
enough information

41:47.662 --> 41:49.328
to speculate on its motivation.

41:49.330 --> 41:52.330
But what I do know is that its
energy requirements are huge.

41:52.332 --> 41:54.207
Something like this
doesn't emerge for nothing.

41:54.209 --> 41:57.044
Listen, we need to deal
with what we do know.

41:57.046 --> 41:58.712
We need to figure out
how to stop it

41:58.714 --> 42:00.174
before it reaches the mainland.

42:10.351 --> 42:13.061
Ms. Murray, go find
this Rena Hangaroa.

42:13.063 --> 42:14.813
Find out what she knows.

42:14.815 --> 42:17.315
That thing's gonna reach the
mainland in under five hours.

42:17.317 --> 42:18.608
Tell her we need your help.

42:18.610 --> 42:20.029
I will.

42:21.739 --> 42:23.072
Good luck.

42:32.041 --> 42:34.751
What's the operational status
of our underwater lidar drone?

42:34.753 --> 42:36.377
I want to get a full
scan of that creature

42:36.379 --> 42:37.794
to see what we're up against.

42:37.796 --> 42:39.714
We've only got
two more underwater R.O.V.s

42:39.716 --> 42:40.964
that are operational.

42:40.966 --> 42:41.966
How long 'til
we get more online?

42:41.968 --> 42:43.468
Half a day.

42:43.470 --> 42:45.595
We'll have to go
with what we've got.

42:45.597 --> 42:47.140
Prepare to send one up.

42:55.106 --> 42:57.690
All right, let's see
what we can see.

42:57.692 --> 43:00.028
How long before
we're in range of that thing?

43:08.036 --> 43:10.703
This is Desolation Valley.
Not much to it.

43:10.705 --> 43:12.665
Are you sure this is
where you want to go?

43:12.667 --> 43:13.960
I'm sure.

43:23.095 --> 43:25.055
There it is.

43:57.629 --> 44:00.130
If you're looking for me
to change your grade,

44:00.132 --> 44:01.799
you're out of luck.

44:01.801 --> 44:02.719
I wish that was it.

44:04.596 --> 44:05.763
I was wrong...

44:06.848 --> 44:08.391
About everything.

44:11.604 --> 44:12.521
Tea?

44:16.150 --> 44:19.820
You were right.
Kaiju exist.

44:24.909 --> 44:26.035
Where is it?

44:27.536 --> 44:30.954
So you would say it
has many legs on all sides?

44:30.956 --> 44:32.622
How many?

44:32.624 --> 44:33.875
At least six.

44:33.877 --> 44:37.837
It's hard to say.
Most of it was underwater.

44:37.839 --> 44:41.301
It also had armored plates
on top like a pangolin.

44:50.685 --> 44:51.686
Like this?

44:53.855 --> 44:55.647
Yeah.

44:55.649 --> 44:57.065
Are you sure?

44:57.067 --> 44:59.025
What's wrong?

44:59.027 --> 45:02.322
The record is very precise
on this kind of Kaiju.

45:04.367 --> 45:06.369
It's called a Tengu.

45:07.702 --> 45:13.208
The name roughly translates
as The Destroyer.

45:24.178 --> 45:28.515
The Tengu lives under the
earth's crust in the mantle.

45:28.517 --> 45:30.850
They feed on volcanic substrata

45:30.852 --> 45:33.060
and that's part of
why they are so powerful.

45:33.062 --> 45:36.858
They can use the stored up
volcanic material as a weapon.

45:38.901 --> 45:42.238
It's considered
a being of the underworld.

45:44.575 --> 45:47.409
The arrival of the Tengu
has always coincided

45:47.411 --> 45:50.036
with a civilization's downfall.

45:50.038 --> 45:52.789
Ancient people didn't have
the technology we have today.

45:52.791 --> 45:54.374
This will not matter.

45:54.376 --> 45:59.547
The power of the Tengu
is fire and earth.

45:59.549 --> 46:02.802
Has man ever stopped
a volcanic eruption?

46:05.471 --> 46:10.435
Man is insignificant against
the power of a Tengu.

46:11.604 --> 46:13.729
Then how do we stop it?

46:13.731 --> 46:15.482
Only...

46:17.443 --> 46:19.444
...another Kaiju can.

46:22.198 --> 46:24.823
The Living Mountain.

46:24.825 --> 46:26.327
The Kaiju Killer.

46:27.785 --> 46:30.912
It is said that
it lies into slumber

46:30.914 --> 46:32.955
waiting for the Tengu to return.

46:32.957 --> 46:36.295
This is the only thing
that can stop it.

46:37.339 --> 46:38.632
The Living Mountain?

46:41.217 --> 46:43.842
We already have one Kaiju
on the way to the mainland.

46:43.844 --> 46:46.094
Are you sure there's
nothing else we can do?

46:46.096 --> 46:48.474
Humans cannot
defeat a Tengu.

46:49.808 --> 46:53.729
Come back with me.
They need to hear this from you.

46:59.111 --> 47:00.568
Take it down a little deeper.

47:00.570 --> 47:01.986
I want to get a look at
the underside of that thing.

47:01.988 --> 47:04.658
Copy that.
Descending to 50 fathoms.

47:09.664 --> 47:12.542
We should be within range.
I wouldn't go any closer.

47:14.001 --> 47:16.629
Okay, we're close enough
to initiate the scan.

47:20.340 --> 47:22.007
Is that
the highest resolution?

47:22.009 --> 47:24.094
At this range,
that's the highest I can go.

47:24.096 --> 47:25.386
We need to get closer.

47:25.388 --> 47:27.471
Sir, I would advise
against it.

47:27.473 --> 47:29.181
We need to get a better image.

47:29.183 --> 47:31.810
Sir, I can't guarantee
the structural integrity

47:31.812 --> 47:33.770
of the R.O.V.
if we go any closer.

47:33.772 --> 47:35.188
I understand, but we need
to get a better image.

47:35.190 --> 47:36.648
Now move it in!

47:36.650 --> 47:39.359
If we lose this R.O.V.,
we only have one left.

47:39.361 --> 47:41.027
It's not about
the R.O.V., Riley.

47:41.029 --> 47:42.362
It's about the people in
the path of this thing.

47:42.364 --> 47:43.866
Now move it in!

47:53.459 --> 47:54.836
Initiating scan.

47:59.173 --> 48:00.550
Oh, look at that.

48:02.302 --> 48:03.887
That is one heck of a mouth.

48:08.057 --> 48:09.055
We need to get closer.

48:09.057 --> 48:10.643
- Sir...
- I know.

48:16.065 --> 48:17.734
Oh, man, look at that thing.

48:25.783 --> 48:28.328
The entire surface of
the creature is armored.

48:29.370 --> 48:31.121
That's a vulnerable spot.

48:31.123 --> 48:32.917
- Give me a scan of that.
- Yeah.

48:35.253 --> 48:38.171
The teeth are amorphous metal
or a metallic glass.

48:38.173 --> 48:41.090
It's one of the hardest
substances on earth.

48:41.092 --> 48:42.592
This is one tough mother.

48:42.594 --> 48:44.260
What makes you think
it's a she?

48:44.262 --> 48:46.970
With deep sea life, extreme
dimorphism is the norm.

48:46.972 --> 48:49.766
Females are usually larger
by a significant factor.

48:49.768 --> 48:52.601
Well, let's hope she's not
here looking for a mate.

48:52.603 --> 48:54.311
She could be
emerging to rendezvous

48:54.313 --> 48:55.813
with another of her kind

48:55.815 --> 48:57.064
and we can't even contain
one of these things.

48:57.066 --> 48:58.609
Just imagine
what might happen if...

48:58.611 --> 49:00.529
Okay, let's bring up
the R.O.V.

49:02.615 --> 49:04.323
It would be better if
it were a he.

49:04.325 --> 49:06.618
[GROWLING]

49:12.207 --> 49:13.334
We lost it.

49:14.334 --> 49:16.627
Yeah, but now we got a target.

49:16.629 --> 49:18.339
We found a vulnerable spot.

49:20.299 --> 49:21.882
Yeah.

49:21.884 --> 49:23.677
Based on our scans,
I'm revising my total estimate

49:23.679 --> 49:25.135
of the mass of the Kaiju.

49:25.137 --> 49:27.264
The energy requirements
of something of this size

49:27.266 --> 49:30.307
are vastly higher than
my initial hypothesis.

49:30.309 --> 49:32.101
Based on these new parameters,

49:32.103 --> 49:35.104
she must be headed to
a substantial volcano to feed.

49:35.106 --> 49:36.481
Oh, there's nothing
of that size

49:36.483 --> 49:37.898
on the ocean floor
around here.

49:37.900 --> 49:40.654
What if it's not going
to a submarine volcano?

49:41.822 --> 49:44.405
What if it's going
to one on land?

49:44.407 --> 49:46.658
Where's the nearest volcano
home for the amount of material

49:46.660 --> 49:48.953
that thing needs for feeding?

49:48.955 --> 49:51.997
The Taupo supervolcano
complex beyond Auckland.

49:51.999 --> 49:54.959
It's a rhyolitic
volcanic caldera.

49:54.961 --> 49:57.336
It's also home to the most
recent supervolcano eruption

49:57.338 --> 49:58.712
in human history.

49:58.714 --> 50:02.091
By recent, I mean
like 70,000 years ago.

50:02.093 --> 50:04.301
Thank goodness, because
it covered the North Islands

50:04.303 --> 50:06.013
with nearly 200 feet of ash.

50:07.723 --> 50:09.685
We need to get General Horne
on the line.

50:13.397 --> 50:15.980
You should work up a simulation
based on the consequences

50:15.982 --> 50:18.775
of that thing reaching the
Taupo supervolcano complex.

50:18.777 --> 50:21.110
Hello! Who am I speaking to?

50:21.112 --> 50:23.905
We have solid evidence
that this Kaiju is headed

50:23.907 --> 50:26.199
for the Taupo
supervolcano complex!

50:26.201 --> 50:29.702
Do you understand the
significance of that statement?

50:29.704 --> 50:32.331
If Taupo erupts,
the resulting ash cloud

50:32.333 --> 50:35.251
could throw the earth into
a nuclear winter scenario.

50:35.253 --> 50:37.377
That is not an overstatement!

50:37.379 --> 50:39.964
You need to convey that
to the General!

50:39.966 --> 50:43.676
In addition, we believe we found
the Achilles heel of the Kaiju.

50:43.678 --> 50:45.928
Repeat what?

50:45.930 --> 50:48.472
Achilles heel!
You know, like a weakness!

50:48.474 --> 50:49.765
How do we know this?

50:49.767 --> 50:52.186
We were the first
to encounter the Kaiju!

50:53.687 --> 50:55.772
Who are we?

50:55.774 --> 51:00.652
We are a marine scientific
and exploration outfit.

51:00.654 --> 51:02.362
What do we want?

51:02.364 --> 51:05.407
We want to convey the severity
of the threat to the General!

51:05.409 --> 51:07.576
Look, this isn't about the Kaiju
getting Auckland anymore!

51:07.578 --> 51:09.244
It's gone way beyond that!

51:09.246 --> 51:13.167
If Taupo were to erupt, it could
be the end of humanity itself!

51:15.418 --> 51:17.462
Thank you.

51:23.262 --> 51:25.637
So you know where to find
this Living Mountain?

51:25.639 --> 51:28.265
The lore is
very precise on this.

51:28.267 --> 51:34.187
There is only one candidate
where it can be found.

51:34.189 --> 51:35.564
There!

51:35.566 --> 51:38.691
It's called Motu Taniwha.

51:38.693 --> 51:42.697
The rough translation would
be "Monster Island".

51:44.700 --> 51:46.828
There are many different
kinds of taniwha.

51:48.288 --> 51:51.413
They can be destructive,

51:51.415 --> 51:54.960
but they can also be our
guardians and protectors.

52:07.806 --> 52:10.767
Now if this Kaiju feeds
on volcanic compounds

52:10.769 --> 52:14.813
like sulfur dioxide,
manganese sulfate,

52:14.815 --> 52:16.356
I think it's reasonable
to infer there may be

52:16.358 --> 52:19.860
a potential explosive mix
of chemicals inside its stomach,

52:19.862 --> 52:21.986
a reverse volcano, as it were.

52:21.988 --> 52:25.490
Now if we were to get the right
compounds into that stomach,

52:25.492 --> 52:26.785
then, boom.

52:28.704 --> 52:30.162
Internal explosion,

52:30.164 --> 52:31.829
hopefully enough
to kill the creature.

52:31.831 --> 52:33.626
But how do we
get past its teeth?

52:34.669 --> 52:36.252
If they are metallic glass,

52:36.254 --> 52:38.462
we're talking one of the
toughest materials on earth.

52:38.464 --> 52:41.591
Well, we need to design
a delivery system that triggers

52:41.593 --> 52:43.468
the payload on being crushed.

52:43.470 --> 52:45.386
Use the creature's
own defense mechanism

52:45.388 --> 52:47.807
to provide a pathway inside.

52:58.027 --> 53:00.027
Yes, Mrs. Prime Minister,
I'm not saying you should

53:00.029 --> 53:01.403
forego coastal evacuations.

53:01.405 --> 53:03.238
We will stop it before
it reaches the coast.

53:03.240 --> 53:04.365
You have my word.

53:04.367 --> 53:06.574
But, ma'am, none of
us have dealt with

53:06.576 --> 53:09.286
this type of threat before.

53:09.288 --> 53:12.373
Who? Billy Ford?

53:12.375 --> 53:14.833
Look, I don't want to tell you
what to do, but if it were me,

53:14.835 --> 53:17.461
I'd steer clear of
that dog and pony show.

53:17.463 --> 53:19.170
What?

53:19.172 --> 53:22.174
No, I'm not being combative.
I will talk to him.

53:22.176 --> 53:23.718
Yes, ma'am.

53:23.720 --> 53:26.348
I'll get back to you as soon
as I have anything to report.

53:28.140 --> 53:30.225
That piss-ant publicity hog,
Billy Ford,

53:30.227 --> 53:32.060
has got some friends
in Parliament.

53:32.062 --> 53:33.687
If he calls again,
put him through.

53:33.689 --> 53:35.437
Yes, sir.

53:35.439 --> 53:37.064
How long before
the blockade's in place?

53:37.066 --> 53:39.401
We should be there
by 1400 Zulu.

53:39.403 --> 53:42.904
Our ship will be in position
long before the Kaiju

53:42.906 --> 53:44.406
reaches the continental shelf.

53:44.408 --> 53:46.409
Okay. Forget what
the tree huggers say.

53:46.411 --> 53:48.286
I want to use a sonic weapon!

53:48.288 --> 53:50.413
I mean, it is
a national emergency, right?

53:50.415 --> 53:53.375
Everything is in place
and ready for your command.

53:54.585 --> 53:56.251
It better be.

53:56.253 --> 53:57.878
I've got too many years under
my belt for my epitaph to read,

Mr. Ford, I got an interesting
call from the Prime Minister.

54:10.269 --> 54:13.895
Why didn't you call direct
like I requested?

54:13.897 --> 54:15.104
Oh, you did, huh?

54:15.106 --> 54:17.524
Who was it?
Media Relations?

54:17.526 --> 54:19.943
Okay, well, don't take
it personally, but if I spoke

54:19.945 --> 54:21.111
to every civilian
who has an idea

54:21.113 --> 54:22.486
on how to deal with this thing,

54:22.488 --> 54:24.323
our phone bill would
bankrupt the Treasury!

54:24.325 --> 54:25.781
Go ahead, Mr. Ford.

54:25.783 --> 54:28.368
General, we've got some
new intel to share with you

54:28.370 --> 54:29.785
on the Kaiju.

54:29.787 --> 54:32.497
We believe it's heading for
a new volcano to feed on.

54:32.499 --> 54:34.125
And we think it's got
its sights set on

54:34.127 --> 54:35.835
the Taupo supervolcano complex.

54:35.837 --> 54:37.587
That is kilometers inland.

54:37.589 --> 54:38.922
What indication do you have

54:38.924 --> 54:40.797
that this creature
can even go on land?

54:40.799 --> 54:43.300
I wouldn't limit your views
on what it might be capable of.

54:43.302 --> 54:45.427
My people say the weight
of that thing is too high

54:45.429 --> 54:47.137
to support itself on land.

54:47.139 --> 54:49.641
We've done the calculations
and, yes, there would be

54:49.643 --> 54:51.308
liquefaction of the soil.

54:51.310 --> 54:53.228
But that's only going to add
to the collateral damage.

54:53.230 --> 54:55.145
Once the soil is
in a liquid state,

54:55.147 --> 54:57.316
it's going to allow the Kaiju
to move easier.

54:57.318 --> 54:59.984
My job is to protect
the coastal cities,

54:59.986 --> 55:02.946

250 kilometers away.

55:02.948 --> 55:06.700
Sir, its armored skin is
made of hardened silica,

55:06.702 --> 55:08.202

55:08.204 --> 55:10.620
Its teeth are made of
a polymetallic alloy.

55:10.622 --> 55:12.164

However, we believe
we found a weak spot.

55:15.044 --> 55:17.001
If we can get
a shot down its throat,

55:17.003 --> 55:18.504
obviously, we got to
get past the teeth.

55:18.506 --> 55:20.463
But if we can get a shot down
its throat,

55:20.465 --> 55:22.092
we think we can start
a chain reaction

55:22.094 --> 55:25.052
in the volcanic materials
of its digestive tract.

55:25.054 --> 55:27.681

of taking it out.

some calculations.

we can pack onto that thing

maneuver it to the target.

inevitably crushes it.

the creature's own momentum

the kill shot.

So what are we supposed
to do with the blood?

01:11:05.325 --> 01:11:08.035
The lore says when the
blood of the Kaiju

01:11:08.037 --> 01:11:10.329
falls on the eye of the

01:11:10.331 --> 01:11:13.165

of the mountain?

Could it be another caldera?

01:11:15.086 --> 01:11:17.835
The closest one to
Motu Taniwha is White Island.

01:11:28.976 --> 01:11:31.016
Well, that makes sense.

01:11:31.018 --> 01:11:32.978
So we need to get
the blood into the crater.

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:35.020
But we can't just drop
the egg in because,

01:11:35.022 --> 01:11:36.814
from the way it falls,
it'll probably be able

01:11:36.816 --> 01:11:38.233
to withstand a direct impact.

01:11:38.235 --> 01:11:41.443
And those creatures
can survive in a volcano.

01:11:41.445 --> 01:11:43.113
We need a plan
to get the blood out.

01:11:43.115 --> 01:11:45.783

the volcano to open it?

01:11:45.785 --> 01:11:46.911
Temperature difference.

01:11:48.287 --> 01:11:50.288
So what you're suggesting
is that we...

01:11:50.290 --> 01:11:53.291
We can heat the egg using
the volcano's thermal vents

01:11:53.293 --> 01:11:54.542
- and then we....
- And then dip it in the ocean

01:11:54.544 --> 01:11:56.543

01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:59.755
I've seen lava reduced to rubble
once it contacts the ocean.

01:11:59.757 --> 01:12:03.883
And then we drop the broken
egg into the eye of the volcano.

01:22:28.369 --> 01:22:30.537
The injured Kaiju?

01:22:30.539 --> 01:22:34.210
The hatchling.
Come on.

01:22:39.174 --> 01:22:40.965
We need to find something
to stab it with,

01:22:40.967 --> 01:22:44.551
something that'll
withstand lava.

01:22:44.553 --> 01:22:47.556
Look for obsidian,
volcanic glass.

01:22:57.484 --> 01:22:58.859
Here!

01:22:58.861 --> 01:23:01.113
We'll use the knowledge
of the ancients.

01:23:06.035 --> 01:23:07.202
Let's do this.

01:23:25.639 --> 01:23:27.680
I don't know how long
this will last.

01:23:27.682 --> 01:23:29.225
Let's go.

01:23:43.114 --> 01:23:46.533
If we survive this,
I'm changing my methods.

01:23:46.535 --> 01:23:48.411
I vow to protect the earth.

01:23:48.413 --> 01:23:49.998
It's going out!

01:23:52.333 --> 01:23:53.500
Now!

01:24:11.186 --> 01:24:12.646
Oh!

01:24:28.661 --> 01:24:30.453
That's a...

01:24:30.455 --> 01:24:31.665
An egg.

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.920
I didn't see that one coming.

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:41.214
What are
we gonna do with that?

01:24:41.216 --> 01:24:45.677
We protect it,
like it protected us.

01:24:45.679 --> 01:24:47.097
I think we're all in
agreement.

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:52.769
Rena, you got room
for some new students?

01:24:52.771 --> 01:24:55.733
If you give up
your mines, yes.

01:24:56.608 --> 01:24:58.400
Done and done.

01:24:58.402 --> 01:24:59.901
We'll start with the mining

01:24:59.903 --> 01:25:01.654
and then look at your
manufacturing facilities.

01:25:01.656 --> 01:25:03.071
Don't push it.

01:25:03.073 --> 01:25:04.740
We're still gonna
need some money

01:25:04.742 --> 01:25:06.200
if we're gonna save the planet.

01:25:06.202 --> 01:25:07.284

01:25:07.286 --> 01:25:10.829
Rena? Any more of those
Kaiju out there?

01:25:10.831 --> 01:25:12.956
Oh, yes, there are
many still,

01:25:12.958 --> 01:25:17.296
friends and foes,
slumbering still.

01:25:18.631 --> 01:25:20.258
You will see.

01:25:21.885 --> 01:25:25.137
The whole world is
Monster Island.

01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:29.226
Then we have a
lot of work to do.
