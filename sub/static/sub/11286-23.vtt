See, first I type in her name
and her phone number.

00:04.864 --> 00:07.864
And where we had our first date,
so I can wax romantically

00:07.931 --> 00:10.831
on the second date.
And then I press enter.

00:10.898 --> 00:14.164
Well, you forgot to put in
how many pieces of candy it took

00:14.231 --> 00:15.931
to get her into the car.

00:17.531 --> 00:20.831
Well, at least I don't have to
lure my dates with raw meat.

00:23.864 --> 00:25.464

00:25.531 --> 00:27.798
You will never guess what
happened to me today.

00:27.864 --> 00:29.698
I was window shopping
on Fifth Avenue

00:29.764 --> 00:31.764
spending thousands,
in my head.

00:33.931 --> 00:37.398
When I saw this.

00:37.464 --> 00:39.698
Regine, you will never fit
into that dress.

00:42.231 --> 00:44.264
It's called the Cherine doll.

00:44.331 --> 00:47.198
Doesn't it look like me?

about Whitney Houston.

00:53.498 --> 00:56.198
I do look like
Whitney Houston.

00:57.498 --> 01:00.504
You know, all the time
people confuse me with Montel.

01:02.704 --> 01:04.938
Yeah, people just chasing me
down the street

01:05.004 --> 01:06.638

You'll be surprised
how many dyslexic transsexuals

01:09.337 --> 01:10.704
want to adopt.

01:14.171 --> 01:17.538
No, you guys,
Cherine is based on me.

01:17.604 --> 01:21.104
I dated this guy at Wishco, the
toy company that makes these.

01:21.171 --> 01:25.004
Obviously when he met me,
he made the mold.

01:25.071 --> 01:26.838
Regine, that's nothing
but a Barbie doll

01:26.904 --> 01:28.304

01:32.804 --> 01:36.304
Cherine is me.
If you..

01:36.371 --> 01:40.071
Look, she has got
six interchangeable wigs.

just listen to Cherine.

fixing fights. Come clean."

Synclaire, King Davis has

‐ Fire away, yes.
‐ Alright.

Well, for starters,
how long you been boxing?

Right. You thought
I was a boxer, girl.

05:21.298 --> 05:24.531
Please, you're too scrawny.
Even I could take you down.

05:26.164 --> 05:27.831
Now, Miss James,
we just met.

05:29.298 --> 05:32.231
Just because you're a good
reporter and have a nice smile

05:32.298 --> 05:35.764
doesn't mean you're gonna beat
me to this King Davis story.

05:35.831 --> 05:39.098
So...you think
I have a nice smile?

I don't know. I've‐I've never
seen a weasel smile until now.

I know you. I've read
your stuff. It's good.

05:54.198 --> 05:56.698
Just a tip. When you thought
I was a boxer

05:56.764 --> 05:58.498
there's one question
you should've asked me.

05:58.564 --> 05:59.698
What was that?

05:59.764 --> 06:01.571
You should've asked me
out to dinner.

06:01.638 --> 06:03.371
That way,
I could have said yes.

06:03.438 --> 06:06.104
So I'm gonna pick you up
around eight.

06:06.171 --> 06:10.004
Why would I go out with
a perpetrator like you?

06:10.071 --> 06:12.804
Because you like me.

06:12.871 --> 06:15.871
And I find
that very attractive.

06:18.104 --> 06:20.571
Say, where you live?

06:20.638 --> 06:22.938
You're the reporter.
You figure it out.

06:26.838 --> 06:30.838
This is ridiculous. We can never
agree on where to go.

06:30.904 --> 06:33.604
Why don't we go out
to that new multiplex theater

06:33.671 --> 06:36.704

slash megamall?

Hey, if this doll
is really based on you

out of millions.

into Marcus Hughes.

07:45.111 --> 07:48.211
Well, he's arrogant.
He is conniving.

07:48.278 --> 07:50.944
He would sell his own mother
to get a story.

07:51.011 --> 07:53.744
And I'm havin' dinner
with him tonight.

07:53.811 --> 07:55.944
Careful. He may just be
taking you out

07:56.011 --> 07:57.278
to pump you
for information.

Ha ha ha. While he thinks
he's picking my brain

08:00.918 --> 08:03.451
I'll be getting him
for everything he knows.

08:03.518 --> 08:05.984
Your lips might be saying
that this is business

08:06.051 --> 08:08.751
but that cheap lip gloss
is sayin' it's a date.

08:11.218 --> 08:12.451
Is he fun?

08:12.518 --> 08:16.284
Well, you know he's kind of
on the tasty side.

08:16.351 --> 08:18.251
See, see, this just
proves my point.

08:18.318 --> 08:20.884
Women are always talking
about they want a nice guy.

08:20.951 --> 08:22.684
In the end,
they go for looks.

08:22.751 --> 08:25.518
And when they want a break
from both, they date you.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.518

08:52.151 --> 08:53.184
Tsk tsk.

08:55.651 --> 08:59.051
So, Marcus have you heard
about the Cherine phenomenon?

08:59.118 --> 09:02.058
‐ The who?
‐ You better recognize.

09:07.458 --> 09:10.991
Well, um, this is
a real nice place you got here.

09:11.058 --> 09:13.958
‐ Khadijah, this is very you.
‐ You don't even know me.

09:14.024 --> 09:15.391
Oh, sure I do.

09:15.458 --> 09:17.958
You're independent but you're
driven by a fear of failure.

09:18.024 --> 09:21.291
You like to give advice, but you
can't admit when you're wrong.

09:21.358 --> 09:24.158
And you're a bit of
a control freak. Am I right?

09:25.124 --> 09:27.358
‐ Not even close.
‐ Mm‐hm.

09:27.424 --> 09:30.758

and get on something else?

like King Davis.

09:32.858 --> 09:34.824
Oh, no, no.
I don't wanna depress you.

09:34.891 --> 09:37.191
I got that boxing story
already locked up.

09:37.258 --> 09:39.058
Don't worry. Someday
you'll have a chance

09:39.124 --> 09:40.391
to crack something this big.

09:40.458 --> 09:44.491
And I'll be off,
covering something bigger.

09:44.558 --> 09:49.358
‐ Ha ha. Like your head.
‐ Oh ho. That was a good one.

09:49.424 --> 09:52.224
You know, there's a question
I've been dying to ask you.

09:52.291 --> 09:53.558
Where's your restroom?

09:53.624 --> 09:55.391
Oh, upstairs,
first door on the right.

09:55.458 --> 09:58.091
And don't be poking around
my medicine cabinet either.

10:17.564 --> 10:20.664
Uh, yeah, but look, we can't
stay out too late tonight

10:20.731 --> 10:22.698
'cause I really gotta get
an early start.

10:22.764 --> 10:24.964
Oh, you sure are dedicated.

10:25.031 --> 10:27.264
We could use somebody
like you at the Voice.

10:27.331 --> 10:29.564
I mean, if I didn't
already work there.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.464
You know, we can use someone
like you at Flavor.

10:34.531 --> 10:36.764
Well, if we didn't already
have a janitor.

10:41.698 --> 10:45.198
Listen to me, if you cannot meet
our needs, we will have to find

10:45.264 --> 10:47.598
another supplier.
Now I'm gonna go over it again.

10:47.664 --> 10:52.431
Two large pizzas,
no anchovies. Alright?

10:52.498 --> 10:53.864
Synclaire,
get off that phone.

10:53.931 --> 10:56.898
And in less than 30 minutes
because I have a coupon.

10:57.864 --> 11:00.504
And why are you so grumpy?

11:00.571 --> 11:03.104
I'm sorry.
It's that damn Marcus Hughes.

11:03.171 --> 11:04.904
He sent me on a false lead

11:04.971 --> 11:07.504
and I spent half the night
at Newark Airport.

11:07.571 --> 11:10.571
So he told you to go somewhere
and you went?

11:10.638 --> 11:14.138
No. He went to the bathroom
and called his own beeper.

11:14.204 --> 11:18.038
Left me a bogus tip. It's
the oldest trick in the book.

11:18.104 --> 11:19.871
Well, now, Khadijah.

11:19.938 --> 11:22.438
It couldn't possibly be
the oldest trick in the book.

11:22.504 --> 11:24.371
Beepers have not
been around that long.

11:27.071 --> 11:28.704
Khadijah, Khadijah.

11:29.838 --> 11:31.804
I had such
a good time last night

11:31.871 --> 11:35.004
I was inspired to write you
a poem. It goes like this.

11:35.071 --> 11:36.838
The white zone
is for immediate loading

11:36.904 --> 11:39.028
and unloading
of passengers only.

11:39.095 --> 11:42.562
Oh, baby, come on.
Look, an "I love you" troll.

11:42.628 --> 11:44.328
You do care, don't you?

11:44.395 --> 11:46.628
I can't believe
you set me up like that.

11:46.695 --> 11:48.462
Don't get all salty
because you fell

11:48.528 --> 11:50.295
for the oldest trick
in the book.

11:50.362 --> 11:52.028
I stand corrected.

11:52.095 --> 11:54.328
You know, I've had
just about enough of you.

11:54.395 --> 11:57.028
‐ It's time for you to go.
‐ Okay, I'll go.

11:57.095 --> 11:59.328
But you'll be
thinking about me..

11:59.395 --> 12:01.135
...specially when
my story hits the stands.

12:01.202 --> 12:04.468
Well, not before mine.
You goin' down, Hughes.

12:04.535 --> 12:08.068
‐ You goin' down!
‐ Okay. Bye bye.

12:09.735 --> 12:12.102
‐ Can you believe that guy!
‐ I know.

12:12.168 --> 12:14.702
He just walked outta here
with my favorite troll.

12:19.932 --> 12:22.032
I gotta break this story
before Marcus does.

12:22.099 --> 12:24.366
There must be something
in these notes I missed.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.899
(Cherine)
Smooches.

12:27.966 --> 12:30.432
What are you
three gals doin' here?

12:31.766 --> 12:34.999
I'm going to be rich.
Wooo‐hoo‐hoo‐hoo!

12:35.066 --> 12:37.799
Wishco and I have reached a
settlement on the Cherine doll.

12:37.866 --> 12:39.332
You know how we always thought

12:39.399 --> 12:41.232
that Regine would
never amount to anything?

12:41.299 --> 12:43.266
‐ Yeah. Mm‐hm.
‐ Okay.

12:43.332 --> 12:46.932
Well, it turns out
she's worth 595 per unit.

12:48.066 --> 12:49.732
Well..

12:49.799 --> 12:53.266
Now you don't have to be bitter
about Anna Nicole Smith anymore.

12:53.332 --> 12:56.032
See, you don't have
to make your fortune

12:56.099 --> 12:58.032
by marrying some old geezer.

12:59.432 --> 13:01.439
That was
a private rivalry, Khadijah.

13:03.039 --> 13:08.239
Anyway, I owe it all to the
legal genius of my best <i>friend.</i>

13:08.306 --> 13:09.606
Right now, I'm your lawyer.

13:09.672 --> 13:12.706
If you want me to be your
friend, put me on retainer.

13:12.772 --> 13:14.472
Come on, you guys.
Let's go.

13:14.539 --> 13:17.672
‐ Lunch is on Cherine.
‐ Oh, I can't.

13:17.739 --> 13:20.972
I gotta go back to the gym
and crack this boxing story.

13:21.039 --> 13:23.439
Oh, Khadijah,
can I come with?

13:23.506 --> 13:25.939
Look...this fight
is a one‐on‐one

13:26.006 --> 13:27.939
between me and Marcus.

13:28.006 --> 13:30.872
Alright. Well, look
at it this way.

13:30.939 --> 13:32.906
You can either
have me by your side

13:32.972 --> 13:34.706
which would keep
your eye on me

13:34.772 --> 13:38.506
or here, by myself,
unsupervised.

13:41.806 --> 13:44.006
‐ Get your purse.
‐ Ah, ha ha!

13:44.072 --> 13:46.306
I can't believe you guys
are passing up lunch

13:46.372 --> 13:48.106
at The Four Seasons!

13:48.172 --> 13:50.972
‐ Well, I'm still coming.
‐ Yeah, alright.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.039
Since it's just gonna be
you and me

13:53.106 --> 13:56.372
I guess I'll take you to the
falafel stand at the corner.

13:56.439 --> 13:58.739
Great. I'll take
the Falafel Grande.

14:03.479 --> 14:05.846
See, that's Rusty Biggins.
I looked him up.

14:05.912 --> 14:08.779
He's a seasoned welterweight but
he's never really made it big.

14:10.746 --> 14:13.679
Wow. Look at that little guy
knock him down.

14:13.746 --> 14:16.312
Yeah, maybe he's havin'
a bad day. I don't know.

14:18.312 --> 14:20.412
And he's fallin'
the same way every time.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.579
Synclaire, what does
that look like to you?

14:25.146 --> 14:27.379
Me after a vodka stinger?

14:28.846 --> 14:30.746
I got an even better theory.

14:30.812 --> 14:32.112
[buzzer buzzing]

14:32.179 --> 14:34.912
‐ I'm gonna talk to him.
‐ I'm not gonna just sit here.

14:34.979 --> 14:37.479
I'm gonna hit the speed bag.
Don't wanna look conspicuous.

14:37.546 --> 14:39.746
Hey, guys.
Lemme borrow those gloves.

14:42.112 --> 14:46.179
‐ Hey, Rusty. You remember me?
‐ Oh, yeah. The reporter.

14:46.246 --> 14:47.679
Well, gotta go.

14:48.846 --> 14:52.012
Look, uh...I know
what you doin' in that ring.

14:52.079 --> 14:54.812
How much does King Davis
pay you to take a fall?

14:54.879 --> 14:58.546
Heh. Pay me?
Lady, I live with my mother.

14:59.379 --> 15:00.686
That answer your question?

15:02.286 --> 15:05.686
Fine. I have everything
I need for my story.

15:05.752 --> 15:07.486
I was just trying
to give you

15:07.552 --> 15:09.552
an opportunity
to tell your side.

15:09.619 --> 15:11.986
Yeah, that's what
all you reporters say.

15:12.052 --> 15:16.152
Look, uh...does your mother
know you gonna take a dive?

15:16.219 --> 15:19.119
Damn. Had to bring
my momma into it!

15:22.152 --> 15:24.386
Yo, okay. But I can't talk
about it here.

15:24.452 --> 15:26.252
Just tell me when and where.

15:26.319 --> 15:27.786
I'm fighting at
the Goldmine Hotel

15:27.852 --> 15:30.819
at Atlantic City this week.
Meet me there tomorrow.

15:31.286 --> 15:32.952
Alright.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.952
Alright, Synclaire.
Let's go.

15:38.619 --> 15:39.886
Hear that?
Hear the rhythm.

15:39.952 --> 15:41.886
‐ Gotta have the rhythm.
‐ Si, Synclaire.

15:45.952 --> 15:49.819
Regine, imagine my surprise
when a limousine rolled up

15:49.886 --> 15:51.186
and you got out.

15:51.252 --> 15:54.786
Well...from now on,
I am spoiling myself.

15:54.852 --> 15:57.719
I've bought all the cosmetics
I ever wanted.

15:57.786 --> 15:59.586
Well, all they had anyway.

16:00.992 --> 16:03.926
And to think I suggested
you buy a mutual fund.

16:03.992 --> 16:05.392
[chuckling]

16:06.759 --> 16:10.759
You will change your tune
when you see what I got for you.

16:12.792 --> 16:14.726
Oh, ho ho..

16:14.792 --> 16:17.226
...a little
Fashion Fair umbrella.

16:18.659 --> 16:20.226
How lovely.

16:20.292 --> 16:23.292
An Elizabeth Arden
travel tote.

16:24.726 --> 16:27.492
You shouldn't have.

16:27.559 --> 16:31.259
Hey, do you know how much
anti‐aging cream I had to buy

16:31.326 --> 16:33.826
to get that free tote?

16:33.892 --> 16:37.159
Oh‐h, watch out now! Lip balm.

16:38.492 --> 16:41.659
And a cuticle nipper.
Well, alright!

16:43.726 --> 16:46.592
‐ Hello, people.
‐ Ah. My attorney!

16:47.226 --> 16:49.126
<i>Pour Vous.</i>

16:49.192 --> 16:51.292
Hmm. Anti‐aging cream.

16:51.359 --> 16:53.326
Well, you might wanna
hold on to that.

16:53.392 --> 16:55.626
You're about
to age ten years.

16:55.692 --> 16:57.926
I just heard from Wishco,
and it turns out

16:57.992 --> 17:00.766
there won't be any royalties.

17:00.832 --> 17:02.666
Wha'?

17:02.732 --> 17:04.898
The Cherine doll
is being recalled.

17:04.965 --> 17:06.732
Huh, what happened?

17:06.799 --> 17:09.031
Did the Ken doll get
a little jungle fever?

17:09.098 --> 17:11.031
[laughing]

17:12.366 --> 17:14.866
Apparently, Cherine's wigs
are highly flammable.

17:14.932 --> 17:18.199
A little girl in Buffalo
left her out in the sun too long

17:18.266 --> 17:20.499
and Cherine
spontaneously combusted.

17:23.199 --> 17:26.165
So, uh...just slap
a warning on the box

17:26.232 --> 17:28.531
and get them dolls
on the shelves.

17:28.599 --> 17:29.866
Well, that's not all.

17:29.932 --> 17:32.166
You've also been named
in a class action suit.

17:32.232 --> 17:33.966
But don't worry,
I'll still represent you

17:34.032 --> 17:35.399
at a discount rate.

17:35.466 --> 17:39.532
And, uh...of course
I'll continue to eat here, so..

17:41.366 --> 17:43.999
Ah, Regine, I'm kinda
disappointed in you.

17:44.066 --> 17:46.399
Didn't you safety‐test
your little face before

17:46.466 --> 17:49.332
you put it on the market?

17:49.399 --> 17:52.732
I cannot believe this
is happening to me!

17:52.799 --> 17:56.099
Man! Just when my ship
was about to come in.

17:56.166 --> 17:59.499
‐ Life really stinks!
‐ It'll be okay.

17:59.566 --> 18:02.306
You'll get your money back
once you return all that stuff.

18:02.372 --> 18:04.206
Oh, no. See, it's
not that simple.

18:04.272 --> 18:07.006
Now, I've gotta go and retrieve
those letters that I mailed

18:07.072 --> 18:09.339
to family members,
cutting them off.

18:13.872 --> 18:15.606
Lemme see if I
have this straight.

18:15.672 --> 18:18.972
King Davis takes a boxer. Pays
his opponents to take a dive.

18:19.039 --> 18:22.039
Exactly. When the fighter's
ready for his big payday

18:22.106 --> 18:25.039
Davis turns around, pays
his own fighter to take a dive

18:25.106 --> 18:27.406
places bets against him,
cleans up.

18:28.172 --> 18:30.472
It's a hell of a scam.

18:30.539 --> 18:33.606
There's a six dollar bag of
peanuts in there you missed.

18:33.672 --> 18:37.039
Oh, no no.
Not for me. I'm in training.

18:41.539 --> 18:44.106
You know, this means
the end of my boxing career.

18:45.339 --> 18:48.339
‐ Sorry.
‐ Ah, don't be.

18:48.406 --> 18:51.606
Feels good to finally
get this stuff off my chest.

18:51.672 --> 18:55.006
Besides, it's time I finally
move on with my life.

18:55.072 --> 18:57.072
Maybe, I'll go work
for my brother.

18:57.139 --> 18:59.106
He owns a Flowbee dealership.

19:00.712 --> 19:02.646
Well, thanks a lot.

19:04.746 --> 19:06.446
Yes! Yes!

19:06.512 --> 19:08.612
‐ Whoa!
‐ Good interview.

19:08.679 --> 19:11.712
Did you know there's
a bidet in there?

19:11.779 --> 19:14.379
How the hell
did you get in here?

19:14.446 --> 19:16.679
I told the, uh, maid
I was your husband

19:16.746 --> 19:18.212
and that I lost my key.

19:18.279 --> 19:20.779
So she congratulated us
on our honeymoon and gave me

19:20.846 --> 19:23.646
a whole bunch
of extra bottles of shampoo.

19:23.712 --> 19:26.779
You know where you can stick
those tiny little bottles?

19:27.846 --> 19:30.112
Baby, baby, let's not fight.

19:30.179 --> 19:32.912
It's the first day
of our new life together.

19:34.779 --> 19:36.746
So, this is how
the great Marcus Hughes

19:36.812 --> 19:38.612
gets his stories?

19:38.679 --> 19:41.212
Somebody else does the work
while you sit in there

19:41.279 --> 19:43.312
on the toilet and take notes.

19:43.379 --> 19:46.546
Well, not every day, but if it
makes you feel any better

19:46.612 --> 19:48.579
I think you're
a hell of a reporter.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.646
Because I tried to talk to Rusty
but I couldn't break him.

19:51.712 --> 19:55.312
Well...there are good reporters
and then there's you.

19:55.379 --> 19:58.612
Ooh...I wouldn't go
there because, see

19:58.679 --> 20:00.512
we both have
the same information.

20:00.579 --> 20:03.486
And since our publications
hit the stand on the same day

20:03.552 --> 20:06.052
a few million readers
are gonna read my story

20:06.119 --> 20:08.719
and a few dozen are
gonna read yours.

20:10.552 --> 20:13.352
But mine won't be running
under an ugly picture of you.

20:14.886 --> 20:16.852
How 'bout we call
this thing a draw?

20:16.919 --> 20:18.252
Okay? We're in Atlantic City.

20:18.319 --> 20:21.052
Why don't we go downstairs,
hit the 299 crab buffet

20:21.119 --> 20:23.286
and catch
the Pips impersonator.

20:24.519 --> 20:26.852
It's like a dream.
How can I say no?

20:26.919 --> 20:30.819
You can't.
Let's go. C'mon.

20:30.886 --> 20:33.886
Alright. Grab us a couple plates
and I'll meet you down there.

20:33.952 --> 20:36.452
I love it when
you tell me what to do.

20:36.519 --> 20:38.252
Well, then shut up
and get goin'.

20:38.319 --> 20:40.319
I'm goin', I'm goin',
I'm goin'.

20:41.486 --> 20:42.552
Nine..

20:46.052 --> 20:49.752
Synclaire, look, it's me.
Listen. No, listen. Okay.

20:49.819 --> 20:53.519
Now, Flavor is about to come out
a day early. Yes, we can.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.086
I've just plugged in a quote
from the boxing story

20:56.152 --> 20:58.386
and I'm sendin' 'em
to the office computer now.

20:58.452 --> 21:01.992
Just make sure it gets to
the printer and don't screw up.

21:02.059 --> 21:03.892
Hey, you know what.
I was thinking..

21:03.959 --> 21:06.126
Uh, wha‐what
are you doin'?

21:07.592 --> 21:09.959
I'm sending my story to Flavor.

21:10.026 --> 21:12.959
It'll be on the stands
in the morning.

21:13.026 --> 21:14.659
Zippoo!

21:16.326 --> 21:18.392
But Flavor doesn't
come out till Thursday.

21:18.459 --> 21:21.892
Heh. Flavor comes out
when I say it comes out.

21:21.959 --> 21:23.926
You see, I own it.

21:25.592 --> 21:27.926
I can't believe that you
actually scooped me?

21:27.992 --> 21:30.126
Tch. Another fact I can't hide

21:30.192 --> 21:32.026
from the brilliant
Marcus Hughes.

21:33.992 --> 21:36.059
So, you think
I'm brilliant. Do you?

21:36.126 --> 21:40.059
No. You think you're brilliant.
I think I'm hungry.

21:41.392 --> 21:42.359
Now, let's go.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.392
Tell me what story
you working on next?

21:44.459 --> 21:46.192
See, that's none
of your damn business.

21:46.259 --> 21:48.992
‐ C'mon, you can tell me.
‐ Why are you in my stories?

21:53.426 --> 21:55.292
(Regine)
'I don't care
what anybody says.'

21:55.359 --> 21:58.059
'You're still
the classiest doll around.'

21:59.759 --> 22:01.732
(Khadijah)
'Regine, stop playing
with that stupid doll.'

22:01.799 --> 22:04.732
'The Repo Man is here
for your big screen TV.'
