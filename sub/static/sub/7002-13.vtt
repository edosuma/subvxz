WEBVTT

00:04.203 --> 00:06.170
Are you ok?

00:06.171 --> 00:08.473
You got so much stuff
crammed in that closet,
you're suffocating my shirts.

00:08.474 --> 00:10.041
Oh, please.

00:10.042 --> 00:13.812
Come on, buddy. Don't die now.
Don't die, don't die.

00:13.813 --> 00:15.880
Clear!

00:15.881 --> 00:18.249
Clear!
There you go.

00:18.250 --> 00:21.252
You got so much to live for.
You're perma-press.
Come on, buddy.

00:21.253 --> 00:24.322
Is it having
an out-of-closet experience?

00:24.323 --> 00:28.893
You got too much stuff in here.
You got 30 hats in here.

00:28.894 --> 00:30.929
I wear all of them.
Oh, yeah?

00:30.930 --> 00:32.631
Yeah.

00:32.631 --> 00:34.599
You wear this?

00:34.600 --> 00:36.635
I did in seventh grade
when I was carmen miranda.

00:36.636 --> 00:38.937
And you still need it?

00:38.938 --> 00:41.006
Yes. Whenever I go to
a new grocery store,
I point to it and say,

00:41.007 --> 00:42.841
"what aisle are these in?"

00:44.376 --> 00:47.045
Belts, belts, belts.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.346
Stupid belts.

00:48.347 --> 00:51.149
Do you need four red belts?

00:51.150 --> 00:53.384
Listen to you.
These are not red.

00:53.385 --> 00:56.220
This is scarlet, crimson,
ruby, vermilion.

00:56.221 --> 00:58.790
What I need is a red belt.

01:01.593 --> 01:03.628
I'm telling you, if you don't
throw some of this stuff out,

01:03.629 --> 01:07.431
I'm gonna organize this closet
and get one with more power.

01:07.432 --> 01:10.669
No. No.

01:10.670 --> 01:13.138
I can hear my power tools
calling right now.

01:13.139 --> 01:16.407
"come on, tim. Plug us in.
We're ready to serve."

01:16.408 --> 01:18.143
I don't hear anything.

01:18.144 --> 01:22.213
'cause women can't hear
power tools talking.
Be right down, guys.

01:22.214 --> 01:24.248
No. All right,
all right, all right.

01:24.249 --> 01:26.284
I'll clean the closet out.

01:26.285 --> 01:28.920
There's got to be
something in here
you can get rid of.

01:28.921 --> 01:31.990
Yeah, but I
stayed married to it
because of the kids.

02:43.328 --> 02:46.164
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

02:50.636 --> 02:54.372
Thank you very much, and welcome
once again to <i>tool time.</i>

02:54.373 --> 02:56.574
I am, of course, your host,
tim "the tool man" taylor.

02:56.575 --> 03:01.079
You all know my assistant, al
"add a g, you got gal" borland.

03:02.481 --> 03:04.482
Tim, we get lots of letters
from viewers

03:04.483 --> 03:06.951
Saying they're
very tired of you
making fun of my name.

03:06.952 --> 03:08.820
Tell your mom to stop writing.

03:10.322 --> 03:13.591
I got a question for you.
How many belts do you own?

03:13.592 --> 03:15.126
Two.

03:15.127 --> 03:16.494
That's right.

03:16.495 --> 03:19.130
Because men are practical.
We only need two belts.

03:19.131 --> 03:23.101
One to hold our trousers up
and another heavy tool belt
to drag 'em back down.

03:23.102 --> 03:26.370
Right, al?

03:26.371 --> 03:28.873
Unlike my wife
who's got 47 belts.

03:28.874 --> 03:33.644
She says six are red,
even though she calls 'em
scarlet and vermin.

03:33.645 --> 03:36.447
I believe he means vermilion.

03:36.448 --> 03:38.449
No, he means vermin.

03:38.450 --> 03:40.384
One is actually
made out of rat hair.

03:42.621 --> 03:46.191
All this week, al and I
will be doing our salute...

03:46.192 --> 03:49.093
<i>(tools crash to the ground)</i>

03:49.094 --> 03:52.030
...To toolboxes.

03:52.031 --> 03:55.533
You know,
a well-organized toolbox
says a lot about you as a man.

04:00.706 --> 04:03.407
What is it, al?

04:03.408 --> 04:04.475
Nothing, tim.

04:04.476 --> 04:06.878
What is it, al?

04:06.879 --> 04:08.112
Well, I...

04:08.113 --> 04:10.882
I was just noticing
how much bigger mine is.

04:10.883 --> 04:13.284
Ooh!

04:13.285 --> 04:15.019
You have to have
a bigger toolbox

04:15.020 --> 04:17.956
To compensate for your
teensy-weensy paycheck.

04:20.091 --> 04:23.494
No, tim.
I need a bigger toolbox
because I'm your assistant,

04:23.495 --> 04:26.697
And I
need to be ready for any
of your particular needs.

04:26.698 --> 04:29.300
<i>(grunts)</i> oh, yeah, you do.
Oh-oh-oh.

04:29.301 --> 04:31.302
You're really shaping up
around here, al.

04:31.303 --> 04:35.139
Well, I have plenty of room
in here for bandages,

04:35.140 --> 04:36.407
Couple of ice packs.

04:36.408 --> 04:38.776
Stop it, al. Cut it out.
Oh, a tourniquet.

04:38.777 --> 04:41.212
I hope you have
a job application
in there, buddy.

04:41.213 --> 04:42.380
Crutches.

04:42.381 --> 04:43.948
Huh?

04:43.949 --> 04:46.517
Iv unit.

04:46.518 --> 04:49.120
<i>(frog croaks)</i>

04:49.121 --> 04:51.055
Mom and dad are gonna bust me.

04:51.056 --> 04:52.691
You should've
thought of that

04:52.692 --> 04:54.058
Before you slugged
mickey walker.

04:54.059 --> 04:56.060
He totally asked for it.

04:56.061 --> 04:58.830
You mean he said, "brad,
my nose is too pointy.

04:58.831 --> 05:01.999
Can you flatten it for me?"

05:02.000 --> 05:05.069
I'd give anything not to let
mom and dad see this note.

05:05.070 --> 05:08.105
Would you give
your barry sanders
autographed football?

05:08.106 --> 05:09.507
Forget it.

05:09.508 --> 05:11.075
I have a plan.

05:11.076 --> 05:13.745
Yeah? What plan?

05:13.746 --> 05:15.580
Do I get the ball?

05:15.581 --> 05:16.914
No.

05:16.915 --> 05:18.916
But I won't beat you up
if you help me.

05:18.917 --> 05:20.785
Works for me.

05:23.088 --> 05:26.324
Now, you won't
get into any trouble

05:26.325 --> 05:29.293
If mom and dad
think they're signing

05:29.294 --> 05:33.097
A field-trip release form.

05:35.033 --> 05:36.501
How do we do it?

05:36.502 --> 05:38.169
Well, it's easy.

05:38.170 --> 05:41.239
You take the release form,
put it on top of the note
and tape it.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.206
Cool.

05:42.207 --> 05:45.076
Hi, boys. How was school?

05:45.077 --> 05:47.311
Great.
Nothing happened.

05:51.550 --> 05:54.218
Tim,
what are you doing?

05:54.219 --> 05:57.389
I was gonna
reorganize the closet.

05:57.390 --> 06:00.425
No. With a sledgehammer?
I don't think so.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.059
Come on, come on.
Give it back to me.
Let go of this.

06:02.060 --> 06:03.895
No.

06:03.896 --> 06:05.897
Before you organize,
you gotta demolish.

06:05.898 --> 06:09.066
After you demolish,
you must call someone to fix it.

06:09.067 --> 06:11.068
I know
what I'm doing here.

06:11.069 --> 06:13.971
I'm gonna remodel it
to maximize every square inch
of that thing.

06:13.972 --> 06:17.542
Look what I ordered for you
at the furniture barn today.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.512
What did you order for me
at the furniture barn today?

06:20.513 --> 06:22.380
<i>(whistles)</i>

06:22.381 --> 06:26.183
A super goliath
modular closet system.

06:26.184 --> 06:28.553
Ho-ho-ho.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.556
Chrome shelves,
tubular steel rods
at top and bottom.

06:31.557 --> 06:34.025
All the rivets are hidden,
you can't even see -
matte-black finish everywhere.

06:34.026 --> 06:36.360
It's got seven drawers
in the middle of it.

06:36.361 --> 06:39.497
Tim, I just need someplace
to hang my blouses.

06:39.498 --> 06:41.566
This looks like
an offshore oil rig.

06:41.567 --> 06:45.236
Oh, yeah,
just like the north sea,
where the men smell like fish.

06:49.742 --> 06:53.711
If, by some slim chance,
we did redo the closet,

06:53.712 --> 06:58.149
This is the one
that I would like.

06:58.150 --> 07:00.452
The lady lavender
quilted vinyl organizer?

07:00.453 --> 07:02.086
Yeah. Yeah.
Come on.

07:02.087 --> 07:05.056
Look, it comes with ten
padded, scented hangers.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.891
Scented hangers?

07:06.892 --> 07:11.162
I do not
want the closet smelling like
madame foufou's perfume parlor.

07:11.163 --> 07:16.501
I want it smelling like
sawdust... Motor oil...
The bottom of men's feet.

07:16.502 --> 07:19.236
Gotta go.
No! Wait! Wait!

07:19.237 --> 07:22.474
Wait! Every time you take
a sledgehammer up to the bedroom
it means trouble.

07:22.475 --> 07:24.342
You come back here,
you little termite.

07:24.343 --> 07:25.844
Let go of my belt.
I'm not gonna let go...

07:25.845 --> 07:27.779
I can't ask them now.
They're arguing.

07:27.780 --> 07:31.549
Are you kidding?
This is the perfect time.
They won't even notice.

07:31.550 --> 07:35.052
How do you think
I got that raise
in my allowance?

07:35.053 --> 07:36.754
You are not gonna
touch this closet.

07:36.755 --> 07:38.590
Just don't get excited.
Listen to me, please,
for a minute.

07:38.591 --> 07:41.058
All right. There's
a lot of wasted space
behind this closet.

07:41.059 --> 07:43.394
I say we blow out the wall,
take the linen closet wall out,

07:43.395 --> 07:45.897
Put all the linens
in the bathroom, you got
more room in there, anyway,

07:45.898 --> 07:47.031
Put a few wires, lights...

07:47.032 --> 07:50.034
Boom. We've got
a walk-in closet.

07:50.035 --> 07:54.338
No. We don't
have a linen closet, and we have
a hole in the side of the house.

07:54.339 --> 07:56.374
I gave you a chance
to get rid of some stuff.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.409
Now it is time
to swing some steel.

07:58.410 --> 08:01.278
Hey, I got rid of some stuff.
I packed a whole box over there.

08:01.279 --> 08:03.414
Oh, really?
The whole box right over here?

08:03.415 --> 08:06.083
You don't have to look.
This whole box?

08:06.084 --> 08:08.786
Hello! Hello! Hello!

08:08.787 --> 08:10.922
Look, some stretch pants
and a shoe.

08:10.923 --> 08:13.257
Nice try.
I'm doing this in stages.

08:13.258 --> 08:17.161
Besides, I know the minute
that I throw away this shoe,
I'm gonna find its mate.

08:17.162 --> 08:21.132
I think I saw it
on the freeway this morning.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.968
You're a pack rat, honey.
I am not.

08:23.969 --> 08:26.971
My mother always said,
"waste not, want not."

08:26.972 --> 08:29.273
Good clothes
never go out of style.

08:29.274 --> 08:32.143
I'm pretty sure
she wasn't referring to this!

08:35.847 --> 08:38.883
That's from
my fat collection.

08:38.884 --> 08:41.619
You could fit europe
in these things.

08:41.620 --> 08:45.156
See, I have divided the clothes
into three sections.

08:45.157 --> 08:47.659
I have my normal-weight
section over there,

08:47.660 --> 08:49.493
Then I have
my fat section over here.

08:49.494 --> 08:51.729
This is for, you know,
after childbirth

08:51.730 --> 08:53.431
And holidays and...

08:53.432 --> 08:55.433
And this? What's this?
The "I have a dream" section?

08:58.938 --> 09:01.606
I will wear that dress again.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.675
No offense, honey,
but you're not gonna
get into that again.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.577
Excuse me.
Don't, don't, don't, don't...

09:05.578 --> 09:08.112
Are you asking for
some trouble here?

09:08.113 --> 09:09.714
You are.
Stop it.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.983
Hey, dad, will you
sign this for me?
Hold her hands.

09:11.984 --> 09:14.318
<i>(jill)</i> oh, you have to
have help here?
<i>(tim)</i> yes, help me.

09:14.319 --> 09:17.154
Wait, don't sign that.
Don't sign it.

09:17.155 --> 09:19.123
Why? It's a...
It's a field-trip release form.

09:19.124 --> 09:21.125
No, no. They wait for us
not to be paying attention.

09:21.126 --> 09:24.528
I think I'm smart enough
to know when they're pulling

09:24.529 --> 09:26.764
That "distract 'em and have 'em
sign stuff" trick.

09:26.765 --> 09:28.566
What is this tape
down here on this thing?

09:28.567 --> 09:30.234
'cause it ripped.
It ripped.

09:30.235 --> 09:34.472
This is a letter from
mrs. Blackburn, the principal.

09:34.473 --> 09:37.041
Aha! Just as I suspected.

09:39.478 --> 09:43.380
Brad, I'm ashamed.
Trying to trick our parents
like that.

09:45.317 --> 09:47.585
I suppose you had
nothing to do with this?

09:47.586 --> 09:49.887
Of course not, father.

09:49.888 --> 09:53.290
Randy, we'll deal with you
in a minute. You get outta here.

09:53.291 --> 09:55.827
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Brad, brad...
Brad, sit down.

09:55.828 --> 09:58.529
Come on, come on, come on.
Sit down.
Sit down.

09:58.530 --> 10:00.164
"dear mr. And mrs. Taylor,

10:00.165 --> 10:02.166
"your son punched
mickey walker in the hallway.

10:02.167 --> 10:04.068
"I reprimanded brad
and informed him

10:04.069 --> 10:07.939
That another incident
would result in suspension."

10:07.940 --> 10:10.808
Brad, what is going on
in your head?

10:16.749 --> 10:19.316
Looks to me like the hamster
fell off the wheel.

10:22.087 --> 10:25.156
How many times
have we told you
not to fight? How many?

10:25.157 --> 10:26.157
I lost count.

10:26.158 --> 10:28.192
Don't get smart with me.

10:28.193 --> 10:30.061
You're grounded, three days.
You know that.

10:30.062 --> 10:32.664
That's not fair.
Why did you hit this boy?

10:32.665 --> 10:34.666
Because he was
making fun of me.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.668
That's not a reason
to punch anybody.

10:36.669 --> 10:39.236
Why are you angry at me?
It's your fault.

10:39.237 --> 10:42.339
Beep-beep.
Back the truck up.

10:42.340 --> 10:44.175
Why is it my fault?

10:44.176 --> 10:46.243
This morning, when you
dropped me off at school,

10:46.244 --> 10:48.546
You hugged me
in front of all my friends.

10:50.082 --> 10:53.117
Wait. That is no reason
to hit this mickey walker guy.

10:53.118 --> 10:54.686
Yeah, well,
mickey walker saw

10:54.687 --> 10:56.688
And started calling me
"diaper baby."

10:56.689 --> 10:58.690
I don't care
what he called you.

10:58.691 --> 11:00.692
You're gonna call him
and apologize.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.694
Besides, so what?
I didn't give you
a real big hug.

11:02.695 --> 11:04.962
I just squeezed your shoulder
a little bit like that.

11:04.963 --> 11:06.964
What's the matter with you?

11:06.965 --> 11:09.701
Just... Please don't
hug me again.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.571
Good thing I didn't kiss him.

11:18.310 --> 11:19.677
Brad, tag me.

11:19.678 --> 11:22.914
This is no fair.
I don't have anyone to tag.

11:22.915 --> 11:25.416
That's the idea, brainiac.

11:25.417 --> 11:26.851
Dad, help!
Please, please.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.720
Tag me, bone crusher.
There you go.

11:28.721 --> 11:31.655
Now it's time for
the evil chiropractor.

11:31.656 --> 11:33.524
Hey, no fair!
You're too old.

11:33.525 --> 11:35.727
Oh, low blow, pretzel boy.

11:35.728 --> 11:37.461
Brad! Tag me!

11:37.462 --> 11:39.163
Oh, double-team him, huh?

11:39.164 --> 11:41.099
Now it's time for
my ultimate move.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.235
The bookends of death.
Aaargh!

11:44.236 --> 11:47.105
Ah! Wah! Huh!

11:47.106 --> 11:49.340
Can't get loose, can you?
Uh-oh, brad.

11:49.341 --> 11:51.342
I think we're
hugging each other now.

11:51.343 --> 11:54.578
Dad, why do you have to be
such a dork?

11:54.579 --> 11:56.480
I was kidding around.
Come back here.

11:59.184 --> 12:02.220
All right, dad.
Give me five.

12:02.221 --> 12:06.657
Oh, man. That's
the last time I team up
with brad the diaper baby.

12:06.658 --> 12:09.160
Don't call him that,
all right?

12:09.161 --> 12:11.763
Come on, mark.
Let's go make fun of him.

12:11.764 --> 12:15.066
I got a better idea.
Why don't you make fun
of each other?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.801
Booger brain.
Weenie.

12:16.802 --> 12:19.637
That's more like it.

12:19.638 --> 12:21.939
<i>(door opens/man hums)</i>

12:21.940 --> 12:23.440
<i>(wilson)</i> hi-ho, neighbor.

12:23.441 --> 12:26.177
Hey, wilson.
What are you up to?

12:26.178 --> 12:28.880
I'm tending my tulips, tim.

12:28.881 --> 12:30.915
Little late in the year
for that, isn't it?

12:30.916 --> 12:33.017
Well, I'm forcing them.

12:33.018 --> 12:35.052
How? By squeezing their bulbs?

12:35.053 --> 12:38.256
No, no, no, no, tim.

12:38.257 --> 12:41.458
Forcing flower bulbs
is making them
bloom out of season

12:41.459 --> 12:44.796
By growing them
indoors in pots.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.864
You know, wilson, brad's
going through this thing

12:46.865 --> 12:48.866
Where he doesn't want me
to hug him anymore.

12:48.867 --> 12:51.269
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.605
He's finally
reached that age.

12:54.606 --> 12:56.573
It's a funny thing, you know.

12:56.574 --> 12:59.143
He doesn't want me to touch him,
but he'll still wrestle
and roughhouse with me.

12:59.144 --> 13:01.245
Well, that's because,
throughout history, men
have been more comfortable

13:01.246 --> 13:04.148
Expressing affection
through combative gestures,

13:04.149 --> 13:06.583
Such as the salute.

13:06.584 --> 13:08.886
The salute?
Oh, yes, tim.

13:08.887 --> 13:11.889
In the middle ages,
when knights on horseback
would pass by each other,

13:11.890 --> 13:15.193
They would raise
the visors of their helmets
to expose their face,

13:15.194 --> 13:18.329
And show each other
that they were friends,
and that became...

13:18.330 --> 13:21.199
A salute.
...A sign of friendship
and respect.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.500
In the same vein,
the handshake evolved

13:23.501 --> 13:27.805
When men
would extend their weapon hand
to show that they were unarmed.

13:31.509 --> 13:33.978
Or to show they didn't have
a little joke buzzer in there.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.980
There you go, neighbor.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.249
Men's gestures
of friendship and respect

13:38.250 --> 13:41.685
Grow out of competition
and combat.

13:41.686 --> 13:44.388
Kinda like
when football players, you know,
slap each other on the rear end.

13:44.389 --> 13:47.191
Exactly! You see, tim,
each man should show affection

13:47.192 --> 13:49.660
In the way that
he feels most comfortable.

13:49.661 --> 13:54.065
Mm. A nicely rolled
wet towel. Ow!

13:54.066 --> 13:55.733
Well, I, myself,
prefer a warm hug,

13:55.734 --> 14:01.205
But I suppose the slashing
sting of wet terry cloth
has its place.

14:01.206 --> 14:03.474
Sure did in my high school.

14:03.475 --> 14:07.845
Of course, only a man
who is truly secure can feel
free enough to hug another man.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.547
Yeah, secure enough. Oh, yeah!

14:12.884 --> 14:14.618
To help out
our demonstration today,

14:14.619 --> 14:16.653
We've invited the boys
from bay city back again.

14:16.654 --> 14:19.223
That's right. The guys
from k&b construction company.

14:19.224 --> 14:22.626
I want a big round of applause
for pete, dwayne and rock.
Let's go!

14:27.632 --> 14:29.901
It's always great
to have these guys with us.

14:29.902 --> 14:32.803
Always great
to be here, timmy.

14:32.804 --> 14:34.705
Well, a little
stucco demonstration.

14:34.706 --> 14:36.707
We're gonna
put some mud on the wall,
we'll get stuccoing, right?

14:36.708 --> 14:38.876
You betcha. We used to
do this all the time.
All right.

14:38.877 --> 14:42.046
Heck, I cut my teeth
on stucco, tim.

14:42.047 --> 14:45.149
Well, learned everything
from dwayne here.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.785
Oh, no, no. Pete here
is the real expert.

14:47.786 --> 14:51.155
We call him
"the stucco bucko."

14:51.156 --> 14:52.890
You dog, you.
Watch out, boy.

14:52.891 --> 14:54.959
Guys, guys, guys.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.094
I don't know
whether you're aware of this,
but that's a combative gesture.

14:57.095 --> 14:59.596
Oh, I was just horsing around
with my little buddy here.

14:59.597 --> 15:01.966
No, no, no, no, no.
It's a good thing.
The knights used to do it.

15:01.967 --> 15:05.836
The middle-age guys
used to extend their hand
and show they had no arms.

15:09.308 --> 15:10.975
Anybody follow that?

15:10.976 --> 15:14.211
I'm saying that's the way
you show appreciation
of one another.

15:14.212 --> 15:15.546
Uh, tim?
Hmm?

15:15.547 --> 15:16.780
<i>(coughs)</i>

15:18.750 --> 15:20.952
What does this have to do
with stucco?

15:20.953 --> 15:23.887
Nothing. But <i>tool time's</i>
more than just home improvement.

15:23.888 --> 15:26.290
It's also about
male improvement.

15:26.291 --> 15:29.994
I think it's time we took
a little time out to talk about
male appreciation, like huggin'.

15:29.995 --> 15:31.128
Oh, bubba.

15:33.465 --> 15:36.467
But, tim, when you asked us
to be on this show,

15:36.468 --> 15:39.903
You didn't say nothin'
about no huggin'.

15:39.904 --> 15:42.906
Well, it's ok for another man
to hug another man, isn't it?

15:42.907 --> 15:44.508
<i>(all)</i> no.

15:45.910 --> 15:49.213
I don't even hug my wife.

15:49.214 --> 15:52.183
That's 'cause you can't
get your arms around her.

15:54.286 --> 15:57.654
Tim, does the word "stucco"
mean anything to you?

15:57.655 --> 15:59.756
Al, al. Hold on a minute.
Well, then, help me out, guys.

15:59.757 --> 16:02.393
How does one man
show another man he just
appreciates what he does?

16:02.394 --> 16:05.162
Well, you buy him
a couple lions tickets.
Hey, all right.

16:05.163 --> 16:06.830
Or let him borrow your truck.
Good one.

16:06.831 --> 16:10.701
You could pour beer
over his head.
Yeah, yeah!

16:10.702 --> 16:12.870
And I did not
appreciate that.

16:12.871 --> 16:16.407
The point is, there's many ways
to show another man
you appreciate him.

16:16.408 --> 16:20.544
And I think, if you're
secure enough, you can give
another man a manly squeeze.

16:20.545 --> 16:23.347
Al, how about a hug?

16:24.883 --> 16:26.450
I don't think so, tim.

16:27.986 --> 16:28.952
Come on. Anybody?

16:31.056 --> 16:33.357
What, I'm the only
secure man here?

16:34.526 --> 16:37.428
Guess so.

16:37.429 --> 16:39.963
Aw, heck. I'm secure.

16:39.964 --> 16:43.567
I appreciate you, timmy.
I appreciate you, rock.

16:43.568 --> 16:46.637
Hey, all right.

16:46.638 --> 16:50.207
Hey, you know,
that wasn't so bad.

16:50.208 --> 16:52.076
Yeah, we're secure, buddy.

16:52.077 --> 16:53.777
Oh, yeah,
are we ever secure.

16:55.680 --> 16:59.116
You know, tim, in europe,
men kiss each other
on both cheeks.

17:03.255 --> 17:06.790
Hey, bucko.
How was school today?

17:06.790 --> 17:09.593
Anything your principal
wants me to autograph?

17:09.594 --> 17:11.328
No.

17:13.731 --> 17:17.300
I was thinking about you
at work today,

17:17.301 --> 17:20.237
And I think
I understand about...

17:20.238 --> 17:22.573
How you feel about
this hugging thing.

17:22.574 --> 17:25.076
So I'm not grounded?

17:25.077 --> 17:27.111
Nice try.

17:27.112 --> 17:29.280
No, I just think
that maybe sometimes
hugging's inappropriate,

17:29.281 --> 17:31.415
And maybe
I shouldn't have done it
in front of your friends,

17:31.416 --> 17:33.417
But that's no reason
to hit anybody.

17:33.418 --> 17:35.419
Dad, what do you
expect me to do

17:35.420 --> 17:37.455
When people
are making fun of me?

17:37.456 --> 17:39.523
I expect you
to use your head. Laugh.

17:39.524 --> 17:40.757
What?

17:40.758 --> 17:43.127
When people used to tease me,
I'd laugh.

17:43.128 --> 17:46.130
People can't laugh at you
if you're already
laughing at yourself.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.764
You know what I'm saying?

17:47.765 --> 17:51.535
You want me to use
other parts of my brain
besides my fists?

17:54.206 --> 17:56.574
Yeah.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.143
And I know you're
having trouble
hugging a man.

17:59.144 --> 18:02.779
But remember, I'm your father.
I'm not a man.

18:04.882 --> 18:06.683
Right, dad.

18:06.684 --> 18:08.752
Anyway, I promise
I won't hug you in front
of your buddies anymore.

18:08.753 --> 18:10.854
Ok.
But I'm still gonna say
I love you.

18:10.855 --> 18:13.390
Oh, dad, that's
ten times worse
than hugging.

18:13.391 --> 18:15.559
Wait a minute.
Hold on a minute.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.162
It's not like that. It's
like we'll be at a ball game.
Pretend we're at a ball game.

18:18.163 --> 18:22.099
Instead of saying, "I love you,"
I'll say something like,
"how 'bout the lions?"

18:22.100 --> 18:24.635
We'll both know
what I'm talking about.

18:24.636 --> 18:26.770
Ok. But don't
say it too mushy.

18:26.771 --> 18:27.971
You mean like...

18:27.972 --> 18:29.973
<i>(seductively)</i>
"how 'bout those lions?"

18:33.545 --> 18:35.479
<i>(jill)</i> tim!

18:35.480 --> 18:37.748
Would you go upstairs
and shut the closet door?

18:37.749 --> 18:40.351
I don't wanna show her this
till I can demonstrate.

18:40.352 --> 18:42.620
There's some more
groceries out there.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.022
Forget the groceries.
I wanna go up to the bedroom.

18:45.023 --> 18:49.059
There's something up there
you've been waiting for
for a long time.

18:49.060 --> 18:51.128
Oh, ok.

18:51.129 --> 18:54.665
I guess I'll be back down
before the ice cream melts.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.404
Not that.
I finished the closet.

19:00.405 --> 19:02.739
Oh, good. Let's go see.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.308
Hi, mom.
Hi, sweetie.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.210
Dad, it's all ready.
I'm going to the park.

19:06.211 --> 19:09.012
Before you go,
how about those lions?

19:10.515 --> 19:11.948
What about 'em?

19:11.949 --> 19:16.654
I said,
how about the lions?

19:18.022 --> 19:20.757
Oh, yeah.
I love you, too. Bye.

19:24.062 --> 19:25.696
It's a guy thing.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.569
Welcome to the tim taylor
clothing management system.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.804
It's unique, it's high-tech,

19:33.805 --> 19:35.839
It's the answer
to your disorganized prayers.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.109
Don't, don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't, don't.

19:39.110 --> 19:40.811
I have to use a remote?

19:40.812 --> 19:43.681
Trust me. Press "one."

19:49.354 --> 19:51.555
<i>What shall we wear today?</i>

19:51.556 --> 19:54.558
<i>(jill laughs)</i>

19:54.559 --> 19:56.126
Hold on a minute.

19:56.127 --> 19:58.161
Does this mean I'm gonna have,
like, a little man in here

19:58.162 --> 20:00.564
Watching me
get undressed every day?

20:00.565 --> 20:04.935
Yep. If you'll notice,
the closet's all cedar-lined
for all our big clothes.

20:04.936 --> 20:08.071
Trousers, jackets, scarves,
upper clothes, there's shirts,

20:08.072 --> 20:11.007
Skirts at the bottom,
pants, everything else, ok?

20:11.008 --> 20:13.277
This is perfect, so far.
All right. You'll notice
all your stuff is pink.

20:13.278 --> 20:15.912
I've got
all your accessories
outlined here.

20:15.913 --> 20:18.315
I've even got a drawer
for your scarves. Open that.

20:18.316 --> 20:20.684
Oh, ok.

20:20.685 --> 20:23.387
Whoa!
Wait a minute.

20:23.388 --> 20:27.891
Could that be
potpourri-scented lining?

20:27.892 --> 20:30.294
I'm still waiting
for the explosion.

20:30.295 --> 20:32.596
Come on. I'd suggest
you shut that drawer.

20:32.597 --> 20:35.566
<i>(tim) the drawer is ajar.</i>
<i>The drawer is ajar.</i>
<i>The drawer is a...</i>

20:40.972 --> 20:42.506
<i>Thank you.</i>

20:45.009 --> 20:46.577
You're welcome.

20:46.578 --> 20:49.680
Ok, now, on to the shoes.
Press number five.

20:49.681 --> 20:51.682
All right.

20:51.683 --> 20:54.951

21:06.331 --> 21:11.201
Tim, I want you now.

21:11.202 --> 21:13.804
Hold your horses,
little filly.

21:13.805 --> 21:16.139
Now the safety precautions.
This is very important.

21:16.140 --> 21:19.777
You'll notice I've done
the whole theme in pink for you,

21:19.778 --> 21:22.513
And a lovely
matte black for me.

21:22.514 --> 21:24.080
This is very important.

21:24.081 --> 21:27.418
Don't ever try
to put your pink things
in my matte-black zones.

21:27.419 --> 21:31.588
Why not?
Try to put this pink hanger
onto my matte-black zone.

21:31.589 --> 21:32.756
Ok.

21:32.757 --> 21:33.990

21:55.680 --> 21:59.015
I found these

of the giveaway box.

22:00.552 --> 22:04.455
You look like
a radioactive leprechaun, honey.

22:04.456 --> 22:07.257
I can't believe
that you were gonna
give this away.

22:07.258 --> 22:09.693
That is the most hideous thing
I've ever seen in my life.

22:09.694 --> 22:11.194
Why do you wanna keep that?

22:11.195 --> 22:13.263
