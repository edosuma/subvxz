WEBVTT

00:09.092 --> 00:10.693
Hey, Jill.

00:10.693 --> 00:12.330
How you doing?

00:13.397 --> 00:15.632
Hope you're having a great day.

00:15.633 --> 00:18.034
Um, I am.

00:18.035 --> 00:19.502
Wow.

00:19.503 --> 00:22.171
Yeah. Um...

00:22.172 --> 00:23.340
Good news.

00:23.341 --> 00:24.574
I'm going to be hitting you up

00:24.575 --> 00:27.043
with that child support payment that was...

00:27.044 --> 00:28.411
that I actually sent to you

00:28.412 --> 00:30.813
but was actually lost, apparently.

00:30.814 --> 00:33.716
So that'll be coming your way,

00:33.717 --> 00:35.284
so that's... that's great.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.587
Um...

00:37.555 --> 00:38.855
Hey, you know,

00:38.856 --> 00:41.290
I've been thinking... reminiscing...

00:41.291 --> 00:43.793
about how we all used to go kayaking

00:43.794 --> 00:46.697
on that little river near your mom's.

00:47.931 --> 00:49.900
Best family times ever.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.903
And also,

00:53.904 --> 00:55.438
I want to give you a heads up

00:55.439 --> 00:56.939
about the phone bill.

00:56.940 --> 00:59.542
Th-They're saying that yours is late...

00:59.543 --> 01:02.111
the one that I was
supposed to keep paying.

01:02.112 --> 01:03.946
Well, I'm on top of it,

01:03.947 --> 01:06.583
and, um, you know,

01:06.584 --> 01:09.151
I don't expect any problems on your end.

01:13.090 --> 01:14.957
Hello?

01:16.660 --> 01:18.829
Come on.

01:20.097 --> 01:21.499
F.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:49.259 --> 01:50.761
F.

02:09.179 --> 02:10.413
Thank you.

02:12.816 --> 02:18.021
So you can see that she's in good shape.

02:24.462 --> 02:25.763
Seaworthy.

02:27.565 --> 02:29.666
When you gestured down this kayak,

02:29.667 --> 02:32.535
you changed hands, but you kept...

02:32.536 --> 02:34.604
you always kept one of your hands

02:34.605 --> 02:37.007
covering the same portion of the kayak.

02:38.542 --> 02:40.544
- Did I?
- Yes.

02:45.382 --> 02:46.849
Now you're trying to look casual,

02:46.850 --> 02:48.485
like you're just standing there,

02:48.486 --> 02:50.252
but you're still covering up

02:50.253 --> 02:52.054
the same portion of the kayak

02:52.055 --> 02:55.024
while you're just standing there.

02:55.025 --> 02:56.459
Am I?

02:56.460 --> 02:58.695
May I see that portion?

02:58.696 --> 03:00.262
Well, it's not a big thing.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.364
I... I need to see it.

03:02.365 --> 03:04.567
It's not a big crack.

03:04.568 --> 03:06.669
I-It's just a surface thing.

03:06.670 --> 03:08.805
And it's as advertised.

03:08.806 --> 03:10.573
- I need to see it.
- It's as advertised.

03:10.574 --> 03:14.243
As I said, it's... it's gently loved.

03:14.244 --> 03:15.512
In my Craig List...

03:15.513 --> 03:17.480
I'm not buying this fucking kayak

03:17.481 --> 03:19.617
until you move away from that area.

03:32.663 --> 03:35.097
Additional sort
of overhand technique,

03:35.098 --> 03:38.167
so we'll begin with a loop,
and one of the advantages

03:38.168 --> 03:41.704
is that it can undergo
intense shock loading,

03:41.705 --> 03:44.874
so what we'll have you do is make a loop,

03:44.875 --> 03:46.709
and then we're going to
make an additional loop.

03:46.710 --> 03:49.946
We've got one here and then one here,

03:49.947 --> 03:52.682
so... I sort of think of it as...

03:52.683 --> 03:54.884
as an upper loop and a lower loop,

03:54.885 --> 03:56.653
and then what we'll have to do

03:56.654 --> 03:58.387
is take the remaining slack here

03:58.388 --> 03:59.822
and begin wrapping.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.357
So you're going to be wrapping up

04:01.358 --> 04:04.393
towards the bottom loop here.

04:04.394 --> 04:07.263
As you can see, while I'm pulling this end,

04:07.264 --> 04:10.299
it's tightening that
loop and locking it in.

04:12.570 --> 04:14.070
Most likely, you'd want

04:14.071 --> 04:15.972
a little more of that tilt there.

04:32.923 --> 04:33.923
John.

05:38.689 --> 05:40.623
- Hey, want to go

05:40.624 --> 05:42.124
to a ball game on Sunday?

05:42.125 --> 05:44.126
Nationals? Yeah?

05:44.127 --> 05:45.796
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:47.230 --> 05:48.230
Because we can sit

05:48.231 --> 05:49.766
in the handicapped section now.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.367
It's right behind home plate.

05:51.368 --> 05:52.368
Cool.

05:56.039 --> 05:58.841
Canada closed
its embassy in Iran today

05:58.842 --> 06:01.343
and ordered all Iranian diplomatic staff

06:01.344 --> 06:03.780
out of Canada. The statement read,

06:03.781 --> 06:05.281
"Canada sees Iran

06:05.282 --> 06:07.249
"as the world's most significant threat

06:07.250 --> 06:09.451
to global peace and security."

06:09.452 --> 06:10.452
And some of the...

06:18.662 --> 06:20.529
Why are we sitting on...

06:20.530 --> 06:22.398
What is this?

06:22.399 --> 06:23.900
Air mattress.

06:23.901 --> 06:25.835
Why are we sitting on an air mattress?

06:25.836 --> 06:28.005
There's nowhere else to sit.

06:29.206 --> 06:32.008
They were supposed to
get this place outfitted.

06:32.009 --> 06:33.009
Yeah.

06:33.010 --> 06:35.177
It would look better outfitted.

06:35.178 --> 06:36.747
Well, yeah.

06:38.015 --> 06:39.749
I'm going to fire somebody.

06:39.750 --> 06:43.152
Okay. Maybe get me a chair, too.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.254
Well, yeah.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.623
So...

06:47.624 --> 06:49.258
Don't worry about the detective.

06:49.259 --> 06:50.259
You'll stall it.

06:50.260 --> 06:52.161
Get back on the travel team.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.263
Get back to Luxembourg
before the physicist.

06:54.264 --> 06:55.765
All I have to worry about for now.

06:55.766 --> 06:56.966
It's his wife.

06:56.967 --> 06:59.235
He's sending her to get the money.

06:59.236 --> 07:01.771
She's flying for the
first time in her life.

07:01.772 --> 07:04.140
Get there before her.

07:04.141 --> 07:07.376
While you're here in Milwaukee,

07:07.377 --> 07:09.011
catch your breath.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.013
Rest, gather yourself,

07:11.014 --> 07:14.217
and then get that bag.

07:15.285 --> 07:18.087
Cantar Walley.

07:18.088 --> 07:20.456
He figured out how to
get the cash they need

07:20.457 --> 07:22.024
to get their program active...

07:22.025 --> 07:23.860
active pretty much from
the day he'd take office.

07:23.861 --> 07:25.694
He got it from us.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.164
We have to get it to where we intended.

07:28.165 --> 07:29.799
There are things in his past...

07:29.800 --> 07:31.834
Well,

07:31.835 --> 07:34.370
he would be a terrifying
long-term adversary.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.705
He's intelligent.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.475
He's resolute He understands the U.S.

07:39.476 --> 07:41.210
He spent some time here.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.578
Doing what?

07:42.579 --> 07:44.513
Competing in the world championships

07:44.514 --> 07:46.248
- of "Battleship" as a kid.

07:46.249 --> 07:48.450
- That little game?
- Yeah.

07:48.451 --> 07:49.718
Against adults.

07:56.626 --> 07:59.595
What do you have to do to
get back on the travel team?

07:59.596 --> 08:01.197
Shore up my piping.

08:01.198 --> 08:02.698
Stop pissing this guy off...

08:02.699 --> 08:04.000
a guy named Leslie.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.247
Hey, man.

08:19.282 --> 08:20.416
Hey, Dennis.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.018
John, I spoke to this detective...

08:22.019 --> 08:23.385
last night.

08:23.386 --> 08:25.855
She called. She wants to interview me.

08:25.856 --> 08:27.790
She wants to come interview me, man.

08:27.791 --> 08:29.258
Fuck. What?

08:29.259 --> 08:31.761
We'll talk about that
at the bar after work.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.332
Hey, Lakeman.

08:36.332 --> 08:37.732
You got the memo?

08:37.734 --> 08:39.168
They've moved divisional parking

08:39.169 --> 08:42.770
into a crummy lot now for some reason.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.807
- Yeah.
- I know you did

08:44.808 --> 08:46.542
because you parked there this morning.

08:46.543 --> 08:47.844
- Yeah.
- But...

08:47.845 --> 08:50.180
- Yeah?
- Same spots.

08:51.448 --> 08:52.614
What?

08:52.615 --> 08:54.417
We've maintained the same spots.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.121
Still mine.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.257
That's on the memo.

09:01.258 --> 09:04.593
And you still park there.

09:04.594 --> 09:07.729
Seriously, C19.

09:07.730 --> 09:10.599
That's a letter, a number
stenciled on the curb

09:10.600 --> 09:12.969
of my reserved parking space

09:12.970 --> 09:16.772
in which this morning
you parked once again.

09:16.773 --> 09:21.343
And in which, if you park
tomorrow, I'll fire you.

09:21.344 --> 09:22.912
Okay?

09:22.913 --> 09:24.080
Got it.

09:24.081 --> 09:25.347
Do you?

09:25.348 --> 09:27.350
Because you said that yesterday.

09:32.755 --> 09:34.656
Lakeman.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.326
Yeah, Leslie.

09:37.794 --> 09:40.329
Are you a McMillan man?

09:40.330 --> 09:42.332
Man, yeah.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.839
Fuck.

09:54.144 --> 09:57.947
The bar after work.

10:01.418 --> 10:03.953
Good morning, co-workers.
I'm Ally O'Donhaill.

10:03.954 --> 10:05.854
I'm Stephen Tchoo's therapy companion.

10:05.855 --> 10:09.458
Thanks for playing a part
in young Stephen's recovery,

10:09.459 --> 10:12.161
and that part is just to be tolerant

10:12.162 --> 10:14.964
of his challenges and limitations.

10:14.965 --> 10:16.532
First an update.

10:16.533 --> 10:20.970
Stephen's doing great
on his cognitive tasks.

10:20.971 --> 10:23.539
Not so good at things
like social processing,

10:23.540 --> 10:25.274
which he should really get better at

10:25.275 --> 10:27.376
because we've worked on it a lot already,

10:27.377 --> 10:28.377
right, Stephen?

10:28.378 --> 10:29.878
I don't have to tell you that again,

10:29.879 --> 10:31.413
- okay, Stephen?
- Okay.

10:31.414 --> 10:35.217
Co-workers, Stephen can
quickly do complicated math.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.318
It's weird, right?

10:36.319 --> 10:37.987
But he might have problems,

10:37.988 --> 10:41.623
say, opening his laptop
or turning on faucets.

10:41.624 --> 10:44.626
Stephen's impulse
inhibitors were bruised,

10:44.627 --> 10:47.964
so there's going to be
some locker room talk,

10:47.965 --> 10:49.365
maybe some touching,

10:49.366 --> 10:50.967
for a time.

10:50.968 --> 10:53.302
Patience plays a big part here.

10:53.303 --> 10:55.871
Co-workers, have you seen Rocky?

10:55.872 --> 10:57.773
Sure. It's a great one, right?

10:57.774 --> 11:00.742
Well, Stephen, here, is going
to run right up those steps

11:00.743 --> 11:02.044
just like Rocky,

11:02.045 --> 11:03.612
for whom, if you remember,

11:03.613 --> 11:05.647
wasn't so easy that old first time.

11:05.648 --> 11:07.916
Well, there's a lot of hard
work in the middle there

11:07.917 --> 11:09.585
that they skip over in the movie

11:09.586 --> 11:10.719
because it's tedious

11:10.720 --> 11:13.355
and painful and grueling.

11:13.356 --> 11:16.959
Stephen's going to be in
that phase for a long time.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.627
Good luck, son.

11:18.628 --> 11:20.362
If you could actually try

11:20.363 --> 11:22.064
not to speak to Stephen directly

11:22.065 --> 11:23.332
unless he's prepared for it.

11:23.333 --> 11:25.167
Like he should be looking at you,

11:25.168 --> 11:28.137
like right at you, before you speak to him,

11:28.138 --> 11:29.705
or you might startle him.

11:29.706 --> 11:31.507
Okay. Sorry.

11:31.508 --> 11:33.109
Yeah, you can just come right up

11:33.110 --> 11:34.943
and tell him that personally.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.545
Just make sure he's prepared first.

11:36.546 --> 11:37.614
It's...

11:57.567 --> 11:58.934
Is he prepared?

11:58.935 --> 12:01.238
You can ask him that directly.

12:03.740 --> 12:05.707
Are you prepared?

12:05.708 --> 12:07.277
Yeah.

12:09.679 --> 12:11.214
I'm sorry.

12:12.115 --> 12:13.283
It's cool.

12:16.119 --> 12:18.355
And that's all there is to it.

12:21.558 --> 12:22.592
Leslie.

12:24.227 --> 12:26.095
What are the terms of my situation,

12:26.096 --> 12:28.897
my working situation with Stephen?

12:28.898 --> 12:32.334
You're both going to perform
essentially the same tasks

12:32.335 --> 12:36.004
more or less until we
determine who's better at them.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.208
Like, right next to each other?

12:40.343 --> 12:41.343
Yes.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.178
So do you need me to say much more?

13:49.179 --> 13:51.647
 - No. I get it, Tom.

13:51.648 --> 13:53.749
And we were able to help you with it.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.518
It's not easy to investigate Americans

13:56.519 --> 13:58.555
if it was instigated overseas.

13:59.889 --> 14:01.190
We've made things difficult

14:01.191 --> 14:02.891
for your European detective.

14:02.892 --> 14:05.662
I'm gonna do more along
those lines this afternoon.

14:06.896 --> 14:08.664
Carlson.

14:08.665 --> 14:11.667
- Thank you.
- Tom, get out of here.

14:11.668 --> 14:14.837
Come on. How many times have we done this?

14:17.640 --> 14:19.074
That's game.

16:10.653 --> 16:13.222
- He's right over there.
- Good. Thank you.

16:17.560 --> 16:21.598
Um, sir, didn't you agree
to open Stephen's laptop?

16:22.999 --> 16:25.367
Yeah. Sorry.

16:25.368 --> 16:27.769
That was two hours ago.

16:27.770 --> 16:29.905
I got a lot going on at the moment.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.741
Well, Stephen suffered
a close brain trauma,

16:32.742 --> 16:34.711
so I guess he's got a lot going on, too.

16:54.063 --> 16:56.598
Denon's in Thursday
to cover our Iran implement.

16:56.599 --> 16:59.301
We're going to task off
today and prep for them.

16:59.302 --> 17:01.870
John, let's give you Field 4.

17:01.871 --> 17:04.506
You should have covered some
of this ground in Luxembourg,

17:04.507 --> 17:06.608
but you fucked that up.

17:06.608 --> 17:09.578
But they're still on the hook.

17:09.579 --> 17:12.047
Now don't overpromise this week.

17:12.048 --> 17:13.714
Sell them on the structure.

17:13.715 --> 17:15.483
You can talk about it with confidence.

17:15.484 --> 17:17.919
Keep it simple. Little
something like this, John:

17:17.920 --> 17:21.256
Hey, let me walk you through
our Donnely nut spacing

17:21.257 --> 17:25.327
and cracked system
rim-riding grip configuration.

17:25.328 --> 17:27.529
Using a field of half-seized sprats

17:27.530 --> 17:29.598
and brass-fitted nickel slits,

17:29.599 --> 17:33.569
our bracketed caps and
splay-flexed brace columns

17:33.570 --> 17:37.673
vent dampers to dampening
hatch depths of 1/2 meter

17:37.674 --> 17:40.976
from the damper crown to the spurv plinth.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.645
How? Well,

17:43.646 --> 17:49.150
we bolster 12 Husk Nuts
to each girdle jerry,

17:49.151 --> 17:52.120
while flex tandems press a task apparatus

17:52.121 --> 17:56.458
of ten vertically
composited patch hamplers,

17:56.459 --> 18:00.696
then pin flam-fastened pan traps

18:00.697 --> 18:05.502
at both maiden apexes of the jimjoints.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.771
Little something like that, Lakeman.

18:14.611 --> 18:17.178
Are you a Mr. Lakeman?

18:17.179 --> 18:18.814
I'm... Yeah.

18:18.815 --> 18:21.082
Mr. Lakeman, I'm Gregory Gordon. Hello.

18:21.083 --> 18:22.250
Hello.

18:22.251 --> 18:24.052
Mr. Lakeman, I work in HR,

18:24.053 --> 18:26.555
and I'm trying to process
your first paycheck.

18:26.556 --> 18:28.424
- Cool.
- It would be cool,

18:28.425 --> 18:29.725
but I can't.

18:29.726 --> 18:31.993
There's an issue. A small issue.

18:31.994 --> 18:33.562
Your I-9.

18:33.563 --> 18:35.664
Your Social Security number, well...

18:35.665 --> 18:36.565
Yeah?

18:36.566 --> 18:40.168
You have too many numbers.

18:40.169 --> 18:41.637
I'm sorry?

18:41.638 --> 18:43.405
You have an extra digit.

18:43.406 --> 18:44.906
Well, that's not...

18:44.907 --> 18:46.708
that's not the way it's supposed to be.

18:46.709 --> 18:49.110
No. You're supposed to
have the normal amount.

18:49.111 --> 18:51.179
Of numbers.

18:51.180 --> 18:53.248
Which is nine.

18:53.249 --> 18:55.016
And I have ten?

18:55.017 --> 18:56.051
Yes.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.919
I'll come by with my card.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.956
No, you see, we have a
photocopy of your card.

19:00.957 --> 19:03.191
There's just too many digits on your card.

19:03.192 --> 19:05.160
I don't know how you've been
using it all these years.

19:05.161 --> 19:06.161
It's unusual.

19:07.697 --> 19:09.865
This is the last place
you remember standing.

19:09.866 --> 19:10.866
Yes.

19:10.867 --> 19:12.734
Just smell the air for something familiar

19:12.735 --> 19:15.070
from the day you were injured, Stephen.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.038
Anything familiar?

19:17.039 --> 19:18.306
No.

19:18.307 --> 19:19.975
I combed my own hair today.

19:19.976 --> 19:23.078
One thing at a time. Don't brag.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.813
Hey, man.

19:24.814 --> 19:26.381
Hey.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.183
Anything familiar?

19:28.184 --> 19:29.786
There's maybe...

19:31.220 --> 19:32.588
No.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.890
Don't say no, Stephen. Say "not yet."

19:34.891 --> 19:36.459
Not yet.

19:43.800 --> 19:48.738
You take girdle... grit-rim jammers...

19:50.272 --> 19:53.876
grit-girdle jimmer jerries.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.045
Fuck.

20:50.132 --> 20:54.736
What can I tell you that's new?

20:54.737 --> 20:58.406
I'm working on a new app.

20:58.407 --> 21:01.743
This one... this one is
different than that last one.

21:01.744 --> 21:03.511
This one could work.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.914
You use it in traffic

21:05.915 --> 21:07.482
if you're thinking about letting a car

21:07.483 --> 21:08.850
cut in front of you.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.586
You aim your phone at them,

21:10.587 --> 21:12.020
and it tells you

21:12.021 --> 21:13.922
whether they're going to thank you or not.

21:13.923 --> 21:16.157
Based on certain algorithms
that I don't know,

21:16.158 --> 21:17.994
um, or...

21:21.998 --> 21:24.132
Working hard there, Lakeman?

21:24.133 --> 21:25.567
4:45.

21:25.568 --> 21:27.502
We generally take it all the way to 5

21:27.503 --> 21:29.204
here, John, FYI.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.906
Sorry, Leslie.

21:30.907 --> 21:33.141
I think maybe my watch is wrong.

21:33.142 --> 21:34.309
You know what I think?

21:34.310 --> 21:38.013
I think maybe something
else is wrong around here.

21:42.752 --> 21:44.786
John, can we deal with
this interview thing?

21:44.787 --> 21:47.223
I've been all afternoon hyperventilating.

21:50.459 --> 21:51.728
Hey.

21:53.596 --> 21:55.363
Yeah?

21:55.364 --> 21:57.398
What does John do?

22:00.770 --> 22:02.503
We're not supposed to talk about that.

22:02.504 --> 22:03.805
Come on.

22:03.806 --> 22:08.576
Okay, but he called me from somewhere.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.613
He's never done that before.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.085
I saw him.

22:17.353 --> 22:19.020
I was with him.

22:19.021 --> 22:20.622
Is he okay?

22:20.623 --> 22:23.959
I can't say, Alice, for certain.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.961
You mean you don't know,

22:25.962 --> 22:28.697
or you're not allowed to tell me

22:28.698 --> 22:30.066
because you're a Tavner?

22:33.035 --> 22:34.870
You know why I'm wearing this?

22:34.871 --> 22:36.705
That weird green suit?

22:36.706 --> 22:39.540
This era-authentic
Beastie Boys licensed.

22:39.541 --> 22:41.009
Il Tour top and sweats.

22:41.010 --> 22:43.612
No, I... I don't know
why you're wearing that.

22:44.647 --> 22:46.547
MCA died Friday.

22:46.548 --> 22:49.218
Yeah. That was sad.

22:51.387 --> 22:53.289
Yeah. It was sad.

22:57.259 --> 22:58.828
Part of me died, too.

23:00.830 --> 23:02.764
Just a little part.

23:02.765 --> 23:04.734
Little cool part.

23:09.205 --> 23:10.872
See, Dad and John,

23:10.873 --> 23:13.309
they always had their thing.

23:14.576 --> 23:16.611
But I'm not musical in that way.

23:16.612 --> 23:19.047
I'm not musical in the
way that I can play music.

23:19.048 --> 23:20.615
I'm musical in the way

23:20.616 --> 23:23.518
that I like beats and fun-loving rhymes.

23:23.519 --> 23:26.822
But Dad? Not into it at all.

23:26.823 --> 23:29.257
But you know what, Alice?

23:29.258 --> 23:30.859
When I was 11,

23:30.860 --> 23:33.128
he took me to the Summit Arena in Houston

23:33.129 --> 23:34.330
for this tour.

23:35.531 --> 23:37.098
And he wasn't that old then,

23:37.099 --> 23:38.734
but he was bald already,

23:38.735 --> 23:41.336
and he was the oldest guy there anyway

23:41.337 --> 23:42.337
by, like, a mile.

23:42.338 --> 23:47.475
And the Beastie Boys had this huge, um,

23:47.476 --> 23:49.410
inflatable dick on the stage.

23:49.411 --> 23:50.511
No, seriously.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.447
And they thought...

23:52.448 --> 23:53.648
It was, like, 9 feet,

23:53.649 --> 23:54.682
and they thought it was really funny

23:54.683 --> 23:57.318
to sort of, um...

23:57.319 --> 24:01.489
poke Dad with it for, like, the whole show.

24:01.490 --> 24:04.459
It was the best.

24:04.460 --> 24:05.761
Man.

24:05.762 --> 24:10.565
And Dad just endured it with a smile.

24:10.566 --> 24:15.771
He just good sported it, you know?

24:15.772 --> 24:17.739
The whole night.

24:17.740 --> 24:20.142
He never said we had to leave.

24:21.143 --> 24:23.578
But what did that story have to do

24:23.579 --> 24:24.780
with what we're talking about?

24:24.781 --> 24:26.014
Because even though

24:26.015 --> 24:27.749
we may be different from each other,

24:27.750 --> 24:29.151
I am a Tavner.

24:32.021 --> 24:33.922
Yeah.

24:33.923 --> 24:36.893
And I'm not going to
talk about what John does.

24:40.162 --> 24:43.332
Would you tell me if he wasn't okay, Eddie?

24:44.733 --> 24:45.935
It's important.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.839
- What is?
- What John's doing.

24:56.145 --> 24:57.279
Listen.

24:58.981 --> 25:01.616
I know that... right now

25:01.617 --> 25:05.855
he's in a normal, safe place, Alice.

25:12.361 --> 25:14.863
What am I going to say if
she interviews me, John?

25:14.864 --> 25:16.397
What did you say at the hospital?

25:16.398 --> 25:18.766
That's not a problem. I... I was vague.

25:18.767 --> 25:19.968
I didn't raise suspicion.

25:19.969 --> 25:21.336
I remember exactly what I said.

25:21.337 --> 25:23.638
I said a slight and stocky man or woman

25:23.639 --> 25:25.106
stabbed me in the thigh

25:25.107 --> 25:27.275
and then ran off to the right or left.

25:27.276 --> 25:29.945
You won't have to interview.

25:29.946 --> 25:31.679
It's being taken care of.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.683
Dennis.

25:35.684 --> 25:37.585
What's a McMillan man?

25:37.586 --> 25:39.554
I have to be one in a week.

25:39.555 --> 25:41.556
A McMillan man...

25:41.557 --> 25:43.058
piping, that's part of it.

25:43.059 --> 25:45.460
Um, but there's other stuff, too,

25:45.461 --> 25:46.794
like beer.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.096
You know, you don't drink enough.

25:48.097 --> 25:50.431
And you're not married.

25:50.432 --> 25:51.799
That's weird.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.134
No offense.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.471
It's just it's weird here.

25:56.605 --> 25:58.339
Are you married in real life?

25:58.340 --> 26:00.141
- I can't.
- I'm married.

26:00.142 --> 26:02.677
Yeah. You were telling me.

26:02.678 --> 26:04.479
That's right.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.547
That's right, right before you stabbed me.

26:06.548 --> 26:07.648
Yeah.

26:07.649 --> 26:09.284
Yeah.

26:09.285 --> 26:12.787
Yeah, I'm fucking married, so...

26:12.788 --> 26:15.023
Listen. Hey.

26:15.024 --> 26:16.657
I'm going to help you out.

26:16.658 --> 26:17.825
We can take care of this.

26:17.826 --> 26:18.994
Thanks, man.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.595
Any progress on that paperwork, John?

26:20.596 --> 26:21.829
Not as yet.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.198
Keep me posted.

26:23.199 --> 26:24.199
Will do.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.568
I need you to do something for me.

26:27.569 --> 26:29.170
What, Birdbath?

26:29.171 --> 26:30.838
I need you to steal some shit

26:30.839 --> 26:33.374
from some Vietnam veterans later

26:33.375 --> 26:35.476
- and then some other stuff.
- What?

26:35.477 --> 26:37.712
Yeah, two other things
that are connected to that.

26:37.713 --> 26:39.747
That's crazy, man.

26:39.748 --> 26:40.781
Yeah?

26:40.782 --> 26:41.983
Is it?

26:41.984 --> 26:43.584
Do it anyway.

26:43.585 --> 26:45.720
Fuck you, Birdbath.

26:45.721 --> 26:48.289
You like to say my name...

26:48.290 --> 26:50.658
Birdbath, my inelegant last name.

26:50.659 --> 26:53.194
You do it a lot. It must
give you some pleasure, John.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.030
I got a lot going on, man.

26:55.031 --> 26:56.864
You should lay off.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.699
You got some important shit, yeah?

26:58.700 --> 26:59.800
Yeah.

26:59.801 --> 27:01.402
And I'm taking up your time...

27:01.403 --> 27:03.271
Jack Birdbath, oaf.

27:03.272 --> 27:04.139
Yeah.

27:04.140 --> 27:05.773
Well, this is important to me,

27:05.774 --> 27:07.108
what I'm telling you to do,

27:07.109 --> 27:09.110
so do my important shit,

27:09.111 --> 27:10.745
and then I'll let you do yours.

27:10.746 --> 27:13.915
You're taking me away from
something dire, Birdbath.

27:13.916 --> 27:15.116
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:15.117 --> 27:16.351
And I got some piping shit

27:16.352 --> 27:17.885
that I need to figure out today,

27:17.886 --> 27:19.487
which you probably don't think is crucial,

27:19.488 --> 27:20.956
you big, dumb fuck.

27:20.957 --> 27:22.258
But it is.

27:25.861 --> 27:28.763
The pool at the Y in 20 minutes.

27:28.764 --> 27:30.598
And don't get all sentimental.

27:30.599 --> 27:33.535
Everybody, underwater treadmill.

27:35.104 --> 27:37.872
We're going to try to
hold it for 15 seconds.

27:37.873 --> 27:42.710
Let's go. 15, 14, 13, 12,

27:42.711 --> 27:47.615
11, 10, 9, 8,

27:47.616 --> 27:53.321
7, 6, 5, 4,

27:53.322 --> 27:56.057
3, 2, 1.

27:56.058 --> 27:57.125
Okay.

28:02.231 --> 28:04.600
Using a grid of... Fuck.

28:04.602 --> 28:05.832
_

28:05.834 --> 28:07.602
Before we begin your deposition,

28:07.603 --> 28:10.105
could you make a statement
that sets the table

28:10.106 --> 28:13.042
concerning the events of May 2012?

28:15.177 --> 28:17.612
I had worked for eight years

28:17.613 --> 28:18.913
at that point...

28:18.914 --> 28:21.449
up until that point...

28:21.450 --> 28:26.754
to keep the country of Iran
from a nuclear capability.

28:26.755 --> 28:28.856
That was a primary task.

28:28.857 --> 28:33.495
That was a principal task
of mine during that period.

28:34.997 --> 28:39.134
And in May... May 2012,

28:39.135 --> 28:43.571
I instigated a series of events that...

28:43.572 --> 28:46.474
would have not just allowed that

28:46.475 --> 28:48.710
but would have paid for it.

28:50.312 --> 28:52.414
Half-seized sprats...

28:53.815 --> 28:55.984
It's just the McMillan way.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.821
Half... Half-seized sprats.

29:00.822 --> 29:02.957
Odd bracketed caps and...

29:02.958 --> 29:06.094
split-flex breeze columns fan...

29:06.095 --> 29:10.365
dampeners to damper...

29:10.366 --> 29:11.500
Fuck.

29:25.114 --> 29:26.415
Fuck.

29:31.787 --> 29:33.222
Hey.

29:35.057 --> 29:36.924
John, I don't sleep.

29:36.925 --> 29:39.894
You're never gonna get any drop on me.

29:39.895 --> 29:41.996
I heard everything you had to say

29:41.997 --> 29:44.132
to the dipshit in the bathroom.

29:44.133 --> 29:47.568
Do what I ask, of I'll break the news.

29:47.569 --> 29:48.670
You get it?

29:57.746 --> 29:59.614
The dog's name is Charlie.

29:59.615 --> 30:00.981
So what?

30:00.982 --> 30:02.383
So when you take the fucking dog,

30:02.384 --> 30:05.086
you say "Here, Charlie. Here, boy."

30:05.087 --> 30:06.755
You'll have a rapport.

30:11.860 --> 30:13.229
Charlie?

30:15.864 --> 30:17.398
A police department?

30:17.399 --> 30:19.134
It's just an evidence room.

30:19.135 --> 30:20.868
Police protected.

30:20.869 --> 30:23.471
I stand trial in two weeks

30:23.472 --> 30:26.407
for something I'm sure
somebody told you about.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.509
People like talking all about it.

30:28.510 --> 30:32.180
I need you to put something
in an evidence box.

30:32.181 --> 30:34.315
I need you to get it in there tonight.

30:34.316 --> 30:38.487
I need you to put this
box in the other box.

30:39.821 --> 30:41.856
How do you expect me to get in there?

30:41.857 --> 30:43.891
It's not Fort Knox.

30:43.892 --> 30:45.860
I've been helping you all day.

30:45.861 --> 30:47.129
You don't know it.

30:48.564 --> 30:50.131
What do you know about Milwaukee?

30:50.132 --> 30:53.734
- Same as anybody.
- It's an ice box.

30:53.735 --> 30:55.836
Sun hardly shines.

30:55.837 --> 30:57.572
Our economy's factory-based,

30:57.573 --> 30:59.707
dwindling since the '60s.

30:59.708 --> 31:03.878
Endemic violent crime in Milwaukee.

31:03.879 --> 31:06.814
Because the premiums were too costly,

31:06.815 --> 31:10.285
our police insurance
pulled the most vulnerable

31:10.286 --> 31:13.020
and harmed police off the street...

31:13.021 --> 31:16.724
the slow-witted, the
overweight, the twerps,

31:16.725 --> 31:19.860
the little ones, the tiny cops, John.

31:19.861 --> 31:23.298
This city did that, this goddamn place,

31:23.299 --> 31:25.800
and they stashed them in the evidence room.

31:25.801 --> 31:28.236
So I'm saying you may have to fight off

31:28.237 --> 31:30.438
a tiny policemen tonight.

31:30.439 --> 31:32.841
You can do it, big boy.

31:35.244 --> 31:37.678
One guy looks normal... Glen Purdue...

31:37.679 --> 31:39.146
But he has PTSD.

31:39.147 --> 31:43.050
That was his calming dog
you took off with... Charlie.

31:43.051 --> 31:46.086
So anyway, with Glen, it all
got a little too dark for him,

31:46.087 --> 31:47.788
and he snapped.

31:47.789 --> 31:50.891
So you pretty much just want
to make a really loud noise.

31:50.892 --> 31:54.196
He'll probably find a
corner and hug his knees.

32:02.438 --> 32:04.506
Aah!

32:17.118 --> 32:18.387
Charlie.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.669
What the fuck!

33:08.670 --> 33:10.806
What the fuck, motherfucker!

33:13.709 --> 33:16.512
Let me down!

33:20.081 --> 33:21.617
Aah!

33:34.029 --> 33:35.363
Hey!

35:18.934 --> 35:22.570
Using a grid of half-seized sprats

35:22.571 --> 35:26.041
and brass-head nickel slits...

35:27.175 --> 35:29.043
- Just tell them.
- No.

35:29.044 --> 35:30.277
- Come on.
- No.

35:30.278 --> 35:32.513
Efram is nearby.

35:32.514 --> 35:34.415
Just call it something else.

35:34.416 --> 35:35.483
I'm sorry?

35:35.484 --> 35:37.785
Just call it a pickle.

35:37.786 --> 35:39.253
- Yeah.
- Come on, Tom.

35:39.254 --> 35:40.656
Tell it. It's a good one.

35:42.190 --> 35:43.692
Okay.

35:44.926 --> 35:46.026
It's big.

35:46.027 --> 35:47.528
What?

35:47.529 --> 35:49.564
It was a big pickle?

35:49.565 --> 35:51.866
Gigantic pickle.

35:51.867 --> 35:54.034
It's not my kind of thing, to start with,

35:54.035 --> 35:55.269
but, it was,

35:55.270 --> 35:57.638
I mean, I was actually enjoying it.

35:57.639 --> 35:59.440
I mean, they're talented youngsters.

35:59.441 --> 36:01.576
And then I see them conspiring,

36:01.577 --> 36:03.778
all three of them, about me.

36:03.779 --> 36:07.482
Then they begin to make
their way over toward me

36:07.483 --> 36:11.418
with the pickle, and the first thing,

36:11.419 --> 36:14.522
they just press the tip of the pickle

36:14.523 --> 36:15.690
- up against...
- No.

36:15.691 --> 36:17.892
The side of my face,

36:17.893 --> 36:19.694
as if it were giving me a little kiss.

36:19.695 --> 36:22.262
- I was like, Okay...
- My God, I loved it.

36:22.263 --> 36:23.664
I loved it.

36:23.665 --> 36:25.500
_ - He kept his cool, though.

36:25.501 --> 36:27.067
This guy never lost his temper,

36:27.068 --> 36:29.570
even with that big dick in his face.

36:29.571 --> 36:31.807
- Hey!
- Could you guys just give me a minute, please?

36:32.674 --> 36:34.374
Meanwhile, in Iran,

36:34.375 --> 36:36.511
the Conservative Alliance's
presidential candidate.

36:36.512 --> 36:38.412
Cantar Walley has seen his recent surge

36:38.413 --> 36:41.115
of popular support
bolstered by an endorsement

36:41.116 --> 36:43.383
from Iran's Assembly of Experts.

36:43.384 --> 36:44.952
Mr. Walley, a harsh critic of the West,

36:44.953 --> 36:46.954
slid well ahead of the opposition

36:46.955 --> 36:50.525
in the new nationwide polls
by a margin of nearly 2-1.

36:50.526 --> 36:52.226
As news of the Assembly's backing...

36:52.227 --> 36:54.495
continues to spread across the country,

36:54.496 --> 36:55.496
regents said...

38:19.881 --> 38:22.549
Splay-flexed brace columns

38:22.550 --> 38:24.719
and...

38:24.720 --> 38:26.688
dam... damaged...

38:27.689 --> 38:30.325
d-dampened damps.

38:32.594 --> 38:33.895
Icabod.

38:36.898 --> 38:39.433
You want to see something cool?

38:39.434 --> 38:41.769
Yeah, I want to see something cool.

38:41.770 --> 38:44.404
Lakeman is going to park
in my space again today.

38:44.405 --> 38:48.308
I parked way off there,
left my space wide open.

38:48.309 --> 38:49.777
See if he parks in it.

38:49.778 --> 38:52.613
If he does, I'm going to fire him.

38:52.614 --> 38:54.148
That is cool.

38:54.149 --> 38:56.050
You want to watch?

38:56.051 --> 38:57.218
Sure.

39:01.189 --> 39:02.891
I'm jacked about this.

39:04.159 --> 39:05.325
You're hard.

39:07.462 --> 39:09.630
It's not just that.

39:09.631 --> 39:12.132
His Luxembourg numbers were all fucked up.

39:12.133 --> 39:14.468
I had to bring back that
nice little Asian kid

39:14.469 --> 39:16.304
to shore up his piping.

39:23.979 --> 39:26.914
And hey, if you're missing me,

39:26.915 --> 39:29.784
well, I wanted to make

39:29.785 --> 39:32.120
a little something special for you...

39:33.822 --> 39:36.224
if you are, so...

39:40.361 --> 39:44.464
I made this in bed, last night.

39:44.465 --> 39:52.465
I recorded myself... you know. Okay?

39:52.974 --> 39:55.310
Just in case you were missing me.

40:05.186 --> 40:06.654
Show time.
