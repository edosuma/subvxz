gone down with the ship.

16:40.717 --> 16:42.719
April 14, 1912.

17:40.402 --> 17:43.488
She hits the berg on
the starboard side, right?

17:43.572 --> 17:44.573
She kind of bumps along...

17:44.656 --> 17:45.907
...punching holes like
morse code...

17:46.157 --> 17:47.450
-- dit-dit-d it --
along the side...

17:47.534 --> 17:48.535
...below the water line.

17:48.618 --> 17:52.289
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

17:52.539 --> 17:53.665
Now, as the water
level rises...

17:53.790 --> 17:55.667
...it spills over the
watertight bulkheads...

17:55.875 --> 17:58.545
...which, unfortunately, don't
go any higher than E deck.

17:58.712 --> 18:00.380
So now as the
bow goes down...

18:00.630 --> 18:03.133
...the stern rises up,
slow at first...

18:03.216 --> 18:04.801
...then faster and faster...

18:05.135 --> 18:07.304
...until finally, <i>she's</i> got her
whole ass sticking up in the air-

18:08.305 --> 18:09.347
And that's a big ass.

18:10.181 --> 18:12.309
We're talking
20, 30,000 tons. Okay?

18:12.559 --> 18:14.644
And the hull's not designed
to deal with that pressure.

18:14.728 --> 18:16.438
So, what happens?

18:16.896 --> 18:18.607
(CLICKING TONGUE) She splits,
right down to the keel.

18:18.690 --> 18:19.691
And the stern...

18:20.150 --> 18:21.151
...falls back level.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.235
Then...

18:22.319 --> 18:23.320
...as the bow sinks...

18:23.403 --> 18:25.322
...it pulls the
stern vertical...

18:25.405 --> 18:27.574
...and then finally detaches.

18:27.824 --> 18:29.784
Now the stern section
just kind of bobs there

a couple of minutes...

18:35.332 --> 18:37.500
...2 hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

18:39.002 --> 18:40.337
The bow section
planes away...

...landing about a
half a mile away...

46:11.861 --> 46:14.197
It was worn by Louis XVI.

46:15.031 --> 46:17.367
And they called
it <i>Le Coeur de la Mer</i>.

46:17.867 --> 46:19.703
- The Heart of the Ocean.
- The Heart of the Ocean.Yes. (LAUGHS)

46:26.209 --> 46:27.877
It's overwhelming.

46:28.336 --> 46:30.005
Well, it's for royalty.

46:31.214 --> 46:33.383
We are royalty, Rose.

46:37.387 --> 46:39.723
You know, there's
nothing I couldn't give you.

46:40.557 --> 46:42.559
There's nothing
I'd deny you...

46:43.226 --> 46:45.395
...if you would not deny me.

46:49.566 --> 46:51.901
Open your heart to me, Rose.

47:07.417 --> 47:11.296
JACK: VVell, I've been on my own since
I was 15, since my folks died.

47:12.422 --> 47:16.426
And I had no brothers or sisters or close
kin in that part of the country...

47:16.885 --> 47:20.221
...so I lit on out of there and
I haven't been back since.

47:20.430 --> 47:22.557
You could just call me a
turnbleweed blowing in the wind.

47:22.599 --> 47:23.892
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

47:25.101 --> 47:29.272
Well, Rose, we've walked about a
mile around this boat deck and...

47:29.564 --> 47:32.567
...chewed over how great the
weather's been and how I grew up...

47:32.776 --> 47:36.446
...but I reckon that's not why
you came to talk to me, is it?

47:38.448 --> 47:40.450
(SIGHS) - Mr. Dawson, I--
- Jack.

47:41.868 --> 47:42.869
Jack.

47:43.286 --> 47:46.539
I want to thank you
for what you did.

47:46.623 --> 47:51.294
Not just for pulling me back,
but for your discretion.

47:51.628 --> 47:52.962
You're welcome.

47:53.463 --> 47:54.464
Look.

47:55.548 --> 47:58.218
I know what you
must be thinking.

47:58.468 --> 48:00.095
Poor little rich girl.

48:00.261 --> 48:02.389
What does she know
about misery?

48:02.639 --> 48:03.640
No.

48:04.641 --> 48:06.810
No, that's not
what I was thinking.

48:07.143 --> 48:08.395
What I was thinking was...

48:08.561 --> 48:11.981
...what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

48:14.651 --> 48:15.652
Well I...

48:16.403 --> 48:20.448
It was everything.
It was my whole world and...

48:20.657 --> 48:21.741
...all the people in it.

48:22.409 --> 48:25.578
And the inertia of my life,
plunging ahead and me...

48:25.787 --> 48:27.622
...powerless to stop it.

48:27.831 --> 48:29.833
God,
look at that thing.

48:30.125 --> 48:32.293
You would have gone
straight to the bottom.

48:34.003 --> 48:36.506

have gone out.

48:36.840 --> 48:39.509
All of Philadelphia
society will be there.

48:39.801 --> 48:41.803
And all the while
I feel I'm...

48:42.178 --> 48:44.097
...standing in the middle
of a crowded room...

48:44.180 --> 48:45.849
...screaming at the
top of my lungs...

48:45.974 --> 48:47.183
...and no one
even looks up.

48:49.018 --> 48:50.019
Do you love him?

48:51.354 --> 48:52.355
Pardon me?

48:52.689 --> 48:54.149
Do you love him?

48:54.691 --> 48:57.694
You're being very rude. You
shouldn't be asking me this.

48:58.153 --> 49:00.697
Well, it's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

49:01.865 --> 49:03.032
(SCOFFS)

49:03.158 --> 49:05.201
This is not
a suitable conversation.

answer the question?

49:06.828 --> 49:08.413
(LAUGHS)

49:09.372 --> 49:11.332
This is absurd.

49:11.958 --> 49:13.042
You don't know me
and I don't know you...

49:13.334 --> 49:16.337
...and we are not having this
conversation at all. You are rude...

49:16.546 --> 49:19.883
...and uncouth and presumptuous
and I am leaving now...

49:20.216 --> 49:23.052
...Jack. Mr. Dawson.
It's been a pleasure.

49:23.219 --> 49:24.971
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you.

49:25.180 --> 49:27.182
And you've insulted me.

49:27.390 --> 49:29.017
Well, you deserved it.

49:29.225 --> 49:30.393
- Right.
- Right.

49:33.396 --> 49:35.023
I thought you were leaving.

49:35.231 --> 49:36.566
I am.

49:38.735 --> 49:40.069
You are so annoying.

49:40.195 --> 49:41.404

Wait.

49:42.822 --> 49:47.076
I don't have to leave. This is
my part of the ship. You leave.

49:47.410 --> 49:50.413
Oh-ho-ho-ho- VVell, well, well.
 Now who's being rude?

49:52.248 --> 49:53.500
(ROSE LAUGHS)

49:54.250 --> 49:57.086
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

49:58.254 --> 50:00.590
So, what are you,
an artist or something?

50:02.300 --> 50:03.301

much of them in old Paree.

You can say it.

50:41.631 --> 50:43.299
Well, well, well.

50:47.637 --> 50:49.264
And these were
drawn from life?

50:52.809 --> 50:54.811
Well, that's one of the
good things about Paris.

50:55.311 --> 50:56.729
Lots of girls are willing
to take their clothes off.

50:57.939 --> 50:59.148
(ROSE LAUGHS)

51:03.278 --> 51:04.654
You liked this woman.

51:05.488 --> 51:07.657
You used her several times.

51:08.825 --> 51:09.826
Well.

51:10.577 --> 51:12.495
She had beautiful
hands, you see?

51:14.998 --> 51:17.333
I think you must have
had a love affair with her.

51:17.834 --> 51:19.836
No, no, no.
Just with her hands.

51:20.169 --> 51:22.839
She was a
one-legged prostitute.

51:23.965 --> 51:24.966
See?

51:27.343 --> 51:28.511
Oh.

51:29.345 --> 51:30.680
(BOTH LAUGH)

51:31.514 --> 51:33.516
She had a good
sense of humor though.

51:36.019 --> 51:37.020
Oh, and this lady...

51:38.855 --> 51:41.858
She used to sit at
this bar every night...

51:42.025 --> 51:43.693
...wearing every piece
of jewelry she owned...

51:43.943 --> 51:46.279
...just waiting for
her long, lost love.

51:47.030 --> 51:49.365
We called her Madame Bijoux.

51:49.866 --> 51:51.701
See, her clothes
are all moth-eaten.

51:53.369 --> 51:56.205
Well,
you have a gift, Jack.

51:56.539 --> 51:57.874
You do.

51:58.207 --> 51:59.709
You see people.

52:00.001 --> 52:01.544
I see you.

52:03.963 --> 52:05.298
And?

52:06.674 --> 52:08.384
You wouldn't have jumped.

52:12.722 --> 52:16.351
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

52:16.559 --> 52:18.227
Rose has already done that.

52:18.561 --> 52:21.397
Look, here comes that
vulgar Brown woman.

52:21.731 --> 52:24.400
Quickly, get up before
she sits with us.

52:25.401 --> 52:28.029
Hello, girls. I was hoping
I'd catch you at tea.

52:28.237 --> 52:29.739
We're awfully sorry,
you missed it.

52:29.906 --> 52:33.326
The Countess and I were just off
to take the air on the boat deck.

52:33.534 --> 52:36.579
What a lovely idea. I need
to catch up on my gossip.

52:40.083 --> 52:41.250
Countess.

52:42.752 --> 52:45.588
So, you've not yet lit the
last four boilers?

52:46.089 --> 52:47.548
No, I don't see
the need.

52:48.383 --> 52:49.425
We are making
excellent time.

52:50.927 --> 52:53.096
The press knows
the size of Titanic.

52:53.179 --> 52:55.264
Now, I want them
to marvel at her speed.

52:55.556 --> 52:57.767
We must give them
something new to print.

52:59.769 --> 53:01.771
This maiden voyage
of Titanic must...

53:02.271 --> 53:03.856
...make headlines.

53:04.107 --> 53:08.111
Mr.Ismay, I would prefer
not to push the engines...

53:08.444 --> 53:10.947
...until they've been
properly run in.

53:12.281 --> 53:13.574
Of course
I'm just a passenger.

53:13.616 --> 53:16.035
I leave it to your good offioes
to decide what's best.

53:16.619 --> 53:19.288
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing...

53:19.455 --> 53:21.040
...if we were to get into New
York on Tuesday night...

53:21.249 --> 53:23.793
...and surprise them all.
Make the morning papers.

53:24.585 --> 53:26.587
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

53:30.299 --> 53:31.634
Good man.

53:33.052 --> 53:35.555
After that, I worked
on a squid boat in Monterey...

53:35.972 --> 53:38.474
...then I went to
Los Angeles to the...

53:38.725 --> 53:41.894
...Santa Monica pier and did
portraits for 10 cents each.

53:42.645 --> 53:44.480
Why can't I be like you?

53:44.814 --> 53:48.317

sometime, to that pier...

53:53.322 --> 53:55.491

just talk about it.

No, we'll do it.
We'll drink cheap beer.

But you have to do it like a real
cowboy. No sidesaddle stuff.

54:12.675 --> 54:13.676
Yeah.

Hello, Molly.
Nice to see you.

01:00:33.806 --> 01:00:36.725
J.J., Madeleine, I'd like
you to meet Jack Dawson.

01:00:38.144 --> 01:00:39.478
Well, Jack...

01:00:39.895 --> 01:00:41.564
...are you of the
Boston Dawsons?

01:00:42.565 --> 01:00:45.151
No, the Chippewa Falls

Oh, yes.

nervous, but he never faltered.</i>

he was one of them.</i>

fortune, perhaps.</i>

still a member of the club.</i>

could always be counted upon.</i>

Tell us of the accommodations in steerage,
Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good.

It happens Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

01:01:29.945 --> 01:01:32.448
He showed me
some of his work today.

01:01:32.948 --> 01:01:37.786

fine art. Not to impugn your work, sir.

Thank you, Rose.

How do you take
your caviar, sir?

01:02:03.395 --> 01:02:06.649
No caviar for me, thanks.
Never did like it much.

01:02:08.484 --> 01:02:11.153
Where exactly do
you live, Mr. Dawson?

01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:14.573
Right now, my address
is the RMS Titanic.

<i>After that,
I'm on God's good humor.</i>

01:02:17.326 --> 01:02:19.245
How do you have
means to travel?

01:02:20.162 --> 01:02:22.331
I work my way
from place to place.

01:02:24.667 --> 01:02:28.337

own luck. Right, Dawson?

01:02:37.638 --> 01:02:38.681
Mmm.

01:02:38.764 --> 01:02:42.601
And you find that sort of
rootless existence appealing?

01:02:45.688 --> 01:02:47.273
Yes, ma'am, I do.

01:02:48.023 --> 01:02:51.026
I've got everything I need
right here with me.

01:02:51.277 --> 01:02:54.113
I have air in my lungs
and blank sheets of paper.

01:02:55.531 --> 01:02:59.952
I love waking up, not knowing what
will happen or who I'll meet.

01:03:00.869 --> 01:03:02.288
Where I'll wind up.

01:03:02.705 --> 01:03:04.957
One night I'm sleeping
under a bridge...

01:03:05.207 --> 01:03:09.461
...now I'm on the grandest ship in
the world, with you fine people.

I don't intend on wasting it.

You're not supposed
to be in here.

Mr. Hockley and
Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...

01:15:13.768 --> 01:15:16.604
...are still appreciative
of your assistance.

01:15:16.938 --> 01:15:20.442

you this in gratitude--

for this time of year.

ROSE: Mr. Andrews...
Forgive me.

01:16:34.849 --> 01:16:36.267
I did the sum
in my head...

01:16:36.893 --> 01:16:40.396
...and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned...-

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:44.234
Forgive me, but it seems that there
are not enough for everyone aboard.

01:16:45.026 --> 01:16:46.736
About half, actually.

01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:49.072
Rose, you miss nothing,
do you?

01:16:49.906 --> 01:16:52.075
In fact, I put in these
new type davits...

01:16:52.408 --> 01:16:55.036
...which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one.

01:16:55.745 --> 01:16:57.705
But it was thought,
by some...

01:16:57.872 --> 01:16:59.457
...the deck would look
too cluttered.

01:16:59.916 --> 01:17:02.252
So, I was overruled.

01:17:02.752 --> 01:17:05.755

it is on an unsinkable ship.

if you don't break free.

that I love about you, Rose...

...that fire is gonna
burn out.

to save me, Jack.

01:46:47.118 --> 01:46:50.788
Not five. As she goes down,
the water will spill...

01:46:51.039 --> 01:46:55.209
...over the tops of the bulkheads
at E deck, one to the next...

01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:58.129
...back and back.
There's no stopping it.

01:46:58.463 --> 01:46:59.714
The pumps.

01:46:59.964 --> 01:47:03.134

but minutes only.

And she will.

01:47:18.316 --> 01:47:20.401

01:47:33.831 --> 01:47:36.334

01:47:44.842 --> 01:47:47.679

You've been asked to put on

01:48:26.884 --> 01:48:27.885
I said, not now.

01:48:28.136 --> 01:48:33.141
I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it's

I saw the iceberg.
And I see it in your eyes.

<i>Love can touch us one time</i>

03:09:03.466 --> 03:09:08.805
<i>And last for a lifetime</i>

03:09:08.888 --> 03:09:15.562
<i>And never let go
till we're gone</i>

03:09:18.523 --> 03:09:22.777
<i>Love was when I loved you</i>

03:09:22.819 --> 03:09:28.241
<i>One true time I hold to</i>

03:09:28.283 --> 03:09:34.956
<i>In my life we'll always go on</i>

03:09:37.834 --> 03:09:42.130
<i>Near, far</i>

03:09:42.171 --> 03:09:46.426
<i>Wherever you are</i>

03:09:46.467 --> 03:09:49.762
<i>I believe that</i>

03:09:49.804 --> 03:09:56.144
<i>The heart does go on</i>

03:09:57.395 --> 03:10:01.524
<i>Once more</i>

03:10:01.608 --> 03:10:05.862
<i>You open the door</i>

03:10:05.945 --> 03:10:11.075
<i>And you're here in my heart</i>

03:10:11.159 --> 03:10:17.999
<i>And my heart will go on and on</i>

03:10:36.351 --> 03:10:40.688
<i>You're here</i>

03:10:40.730 --> 03:10:44.984
<i>There's nothing I fear</i>

03:10:45.026 --> 03:10:47.445
<i>And I know</i>

03:10:47.528 --> 03:10:54.077
<i>That my heart will go on</i>

03:10:56.204 --> 03:11:00.375
<i>We'll stay</i>

03:11:00.458 --> 03:11:04.879
<i>Forever this way</i>

03:11:04.963 --> 03:11:09.300
You are safe in <i>my</i> heart

03:11:09.384 --> 03:11:14.889
<i>And my heart will go on</i>

03:11:14.973 --> 03:11:19.560
<i>And on</i>
