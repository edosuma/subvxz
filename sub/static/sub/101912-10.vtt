13:12.269 --> 13:13.183
[people screaming]

13:13.314 --> 13:15.098
Nobody fucking move!

13:18.449 --> 13:21.061
-Where is Alfred Pennyworth?
-He's not here. Who are you?

13:21.191 --> 13:23.715
-Where the fuck is he?!
-I don't know.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.674
What's that?
What you got there?

13:25.805 --> 13:27.328
-It's nothing.
-Give it to me.

13:27.458 --> 13:28.938
-[Aziz] No!
-No! No!

13:29.069 --> 13:30.461
[people screaming]

13:30.592 --> 13:32.942
[gasping]

13:47.130 --> 13:49.350
What the hell?

13:49.480 --> 13:52.353
-I'm okay.
-Yeah, me, too.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.007
Is everyone okay?

13:54.137 --> 13:55.356
Yeah.

13:58.185 --> 13:59.273
Oh.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.931
They think they have taken
Stormcloud from us,

14:05.061 --> 14:08.586
but actually I let them take one
of these de-weaponized capsules.

14:08.717 --> 14:10.675
A ruse de guerre,
as you Army chaps call it.

14:10.806 --> 14:13.156
A dastardly trick
is what I call it.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.680
You never wanted peace.

14:15.811 --> 14:18.074
You actually want
to use this vile bomb.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.642
We offered peace. They refused.

14:20.772 --> 14:23.210
That's all.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.995
The world will see that we tried
our best to avoid this outcome.

14:27.301 --> 14:29.433
Don't you see?

14:29.564 --> 14:31.261
We'll be blameless
in the eyes of the world.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.567
And in your conscience?

14:32.697 --> 14:36.136
My conscience is clear.

14:36.266 --> 14:39.835
Our enemies need to know terror
and humiliation.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.751
Anything less than that,
they still have hope.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.711
And until they have no hope,
true peace is impossible.

14:46.842 --> 14:49.497
The British Army
will not commit atrocities,

14:49.627 --> 14:52.630
however well-concealed
and justified.

14:52.761 --> 14:55.372
Stormcloud will not be used.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.070
Mm. I'm afraid
that's not up to you.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.898
Bloody well is.

14:59.028 --> 15:01.161
You need an Army airship
to deliver the damn thing,

15:01.291 --> 15:03.511
and that you shall not have.

15:03.641 --> 15:05.295
Actually, I don't need
your airship.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.776
I don't need you or the Army.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.299
What are you talking about?

15:09.430 --> 15:12.433
I like to plan far ahead.

15:12.563 --> 15:15.392
And I suspected you'd turn soft.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.351
So I made sure your help
wouldn't be essential.

15:19.309 --> 15:23.183
Progress waits for no man,
you know.

15:23.313 --> 15:25.185
Stormcloud is already
on-site in Central London.

15:27.361 --> 15:31.191
Ready to be detonated...
any time I wish.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.323
[Thursday]
Oh, my God.

15:33.454 --> 15:34.585
You're mad.

15:34.716 --> 15:37.501
You're actually mad.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.764
I won't let you do this.

15:39.895 --> 15:42.245
Not your call, old chap.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.422
Unhand me, boy!

15:45.553 --> 15:46.684
I understand this is all
new and shocking.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.164
[phone ringing]

15:48.295 --> 15:50.253
In an hour it will all be over.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.472
Tomorrow you'll thank me.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.822
Sir?

15:53.953 --> 15:56.781
-League HQ on the line.
-Ah.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.653
Listen to this.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.179
[Aziz]
Bravo.

16:03.310 --> 16:04.702
You played us very neatly.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.226
I don't know
what you're referring to.

16:06.356 --> 16:09.316
Very well.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.187
As prime minister
of Her Majesty's government

16:11.318 --> 16:14.669
and leader of the League
armed forces,

16:14.799 --> 16:18.064
I formally surrender
on the terms you specified.

16:18.194 --> 16:20.762
I will relay the same message
to the international community.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.593
Too late, I'm afraid.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.247
A deadline is a deadline.

16:27.377 --> 16:29.423
The... the deadline
is a technicality.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.686
I say again,
we are surrendering.

16:31.816 --> 16:34.471
You no longer have that option.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.343
We shall respond
with appropriate force,

16:36.473 --> 16:38.562
as promised.

16:38.693 --> 16:41.826
I'll give you, mm, enough time
to say your goodbyes.

16:41.957 --> 16:45.178
-[people gasping]
-But not enough time to escape.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.310
Though you are welcome to try.

16:47.441 --> 16:48.703
Entirely up to you.

16:51.923 --> 16:54.709
Hello? Hello?

16:56.624 --> 16:58.539
[phone clicks]

16:58.669 --> 17:00.584
Well, that's that, then.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.630
But shouldn't we try to run?

17:02.760 --> 17:03.935
-There's no time.
-[Aziz] Besides,

17:04.066 --> 17:05.981
we'd be leaving else
in London to die.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.678
It's not quite the thing,
really, is it?

17:07.809 --> 17:10.116
Those that want to
should try though, certainly.

17:10.246 --> 17:11.552
I'm sorry.

17:11.682 --> 17:12.727
[indistinct chatter]

17:14.990 --> 17:16.948
[Troy]
Shame.

17:17.079 --> 17:20.387
I had a tenner on the sweeps
at Newmarket.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.216
Sorry, old chap.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.261
-[Troy] Cheers.
-Martha.

17:26.741 --> 17:29.700
We have a new life to think of.
Shouldn't we at least

17:29.831 --> 17:30.875
try and get you and our baby
out of here?

17:31.006 --> 17:33.704
Yeah, I wish.
Lucius is right.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.924
There's no time. Hey.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.580
I've got a better idea.

17:39.710 --> 17:40.711
Let's get married.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.887
Married? Now?

17:43.018 --> 17:44.367
[laughs softly]
Cold feet, huh?

17:45.586 --> 17:46.630
No, I...

17:48.806 --> 17:50.504
Let's do it.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.854
Okay.

17:52.984 --> 17:55.248
-Victor?
-Mm?

17:55.378 --> 17:56.336
Will you marry us?

17:57.728 --> 17:58.686
Uh, splendid idea!

17:58.816 --> 18:00.514
[laughs]

18:10.611 --> 18:12.134
Hello, Mum.

18:12.265 --> 18:13.570
[exhales]

18:19.881 --> 18:20.838
You all right?

18:24.799 --> 18:26.409
I'll put the kettle on, eh?

18:30.848 --> 18:32.241
You look terrible.

18:32.372 --> 18:34.504
You look lovely.

18:34.635 --> 18:37.638
I'll help Daveboy with the tea.

18:37.768 --> 18:41.424
You, behave yourself.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.948
And, Mum, give him a chance
to explain himself

18:44.079 --> 18:45.428
before you give him a walloping.

18:52.827 --> 18:53.915
Why didn't you tell us
you were alive?

18:56.483 --> 18:59.921
I didn't want you
to see me like this.

19:00.051 --> 19:01.662
And I knew
you'd be angry with me.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.794
Bloody right I'm angry.

19:07.624 --> 19:10.410
You did that to yourself.

19:10.540 --> 19:11.889
To us.

19:14.022 --> 19:15.719
It's as if I never knew you.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.333
I had no idea
you were so unhappy.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.465
I wasn't unhappy.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.424
-You killed yourself.
-For a higher cause.

19:24.554 --> 19:27.557
Balls.

19:27.688 --> 19:28.689
-[coughing]
-Higher than our marriage?

19:30.778 --> 19:32.171
Higher than me?

19:33.824 --> 19:37.350
For once in me life...

19:37.480 --> 19:39.178
I wanted to do something useful.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.790
Something important.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.054
What are you talking about?

19:46.185 --> 19:48.317
Your whole life you've
been useful and important.

19:48.448 --> 19:49.492
No.

19:52.408 --> 19:53.975
I was a servant.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.327
A lackey.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.677
Bowed

20:00.808 --> 20:03.593
and served...

20:03.724 --> 20:06.422
and opened doors for me betters.

20:06.553 --> 20:09.295
Not them.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.906
Me.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.343
You were important to me.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.828
And useful.

20:20.958 --> 20:22.699
Now and again.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.621
I thought we had a good life.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.459
We did.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.737
We did.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.740
[phone ringing]

21:08.832 --> 21:10.617
I'll get it.

21:14.751 --> 21:15.926
Hello?

21:16.057 --> 21:17.928
Alfie?

21:18.059 --> 21:20.322
Bad news.
We got played.

21:24.195 --> 21:25.936
Thanks very much.

21:29.984 --> 21:31.638
[indistinct conversation]

21:38.819 --> 21:40.342
[Mr. Pennyworth]
Yeah, of course.

21:40.473 --> 21:41.822
-[Mary] Are you listening?
-[Mr. Pennyworth] Of course.

21:41.952 --> 21:43.302
Mum.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.567
I'm sorry.

21:47.697 --> 21:49.438
I made a mistake.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.573
I shouldn't have
brought him here.

21:55.183 --> 21:57.490
[Mary]
Why? What's wrong?

21:57.620 --> 21:59.448
Tell her, Dad.

21:59.579 --> 22:01.102
Tell her the truth.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.453
I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.805
All this talk of love
and forgiveness was lies.

22:11.242 --> 22:12.896
He only pretended he wanted
to come here and see you.

22:15.116 --> 22:17.988
Part of a trick to make us
think we're safe, but we're not.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.297
-I don't understand.
-The Ravens are gonna drop

22:22.428 --> 22:24.865
that bloody gas bomb on us
anytime now.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.736
And this one here arranged it.

22:26.867 --> 22:29.043
By lying to me.

22:31.088 --> 22:32.525
Is that true?

22:34.875 --> 22:36.529
Say it.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.098
I did want to see you again.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.798
That wasn't a lie.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.669
And I am dying.

22:48.584 --> 22:50.151
But yes.

22:50.281 --> 22:52.153
The rest was a lie.

22:54.285 --> 22:55.722
I see.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.727
-That's very disappointing.
-I'm sorry.

23:00.857 --> 23:02.076
No, you're not.

23:02.206 --> 23:03.599
This is what you wanted,
wasn't it?

23:03.730 --> 23:04.948
Why would you be sorry?

23:05.079 --> 23:07.560
Great changes cause great pain.

23:09.170 --> 23:10.650
Sacrifice is necessary.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.652
Sacrifice?

23:12.782 --> 23:14.567
Your own wife?

23:14.697 --> 23:16.830
My wife, my son...

23:16.960 --> 23:19.180
myself, yes.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.402
Much as I love you both.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.753
We're nobodies.

23:26.883 --> 23:28.581
She's not a nobody.

23:28.711 --> 23:30.800
She's my fucking mum.

23:34.151 --> 23:35.936
Zero Hour approaches,
Miss Dixon.

23:39.026 --> 23:40.767
Steel yourself.

23:40.897 --> 23:42.725
History is in the making.

23:42.856 --> 23:45.206
Yes, sir.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.730
I think I need a little privacy.

23:53.910 --> 23:56.217
I'll be in the penthouse.

23:56.347 --> 23:58.654
I'm not to be disturbed
under any circumstances.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.569
Yes, sir.

24:05.182 --> 24:07.010
Hmm.

24:13.887 --> 24:16.759
[grunting]

24:26.377 --> 24:28.858
Nothing better than a plain
digestive biscuit, eh?

24:28.989 --> 24:30.599
Hmm?

24:31.861 --> 24:33.210
[Daveboy slurps]

24:33.341 --> 24:35.212
You can keep your jaffa cakes.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.520
Hmm.

24:38.651 --> 24:39.869
[slurps]

24:42.002 --> 24:44.352
Is it quick, then?

24:44.483 --> 24:47.877
This bomb of yours--
will it kill us quick, at least?

24:48.008 --> 24:50.010
So I'm told.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.838
That's something anyway.

24:55.798 --> 24:57.496
I know I betrayed you.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.065
And I know you can't forgive me.

25:02.196 --> 25:03.850
[Mary]
Did I say that?

25:05.155 --> 25:07.244
I love you, don't I?

25:07.375 --> 25:08.811
And you love me, don't you?

25:10.073 --> 25:11.292
Yes, I do.

25:11.422 --> 25:13.207
Well, then.

25:15.209 --> 25:16.645
'Course I forgive you.

25:18.212 --> 25:19.909
[Alfred]
I don't.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.781
I don't forgive you.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.393
I wouldn't expect
anything else, son.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.526
You're a man of hard principles.

25:29.049 --> 25:30.354
You take after me that way.

25:30.485 --> 25:32.400
I am nothing like you.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.098
No.
No, you're a...

25:35.229 --> 25:37.013
you're a better man than me.

25:37.144 --> 25:38.319
That's for sure.

25:41.104 --> 25:43.019
You have your mother's talent
for happiness.

25:47.241 --> 25:48.982
I never got the hang of it.

25:51.158 --> 25:53.377
Funny thing.

25:53.508 --> 25:56.990
But when you gave me that gun...

25:57.120 --> 25:59.253
I thought you were saving
my life because I'm your son.

26:01.211 --> 26:02.256
Because you love me.

26:02.386 --> 26:03.910
I do.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.521
Bollocks!

26:06.652 --> 26:08.828
I thought I was getting
my dad back.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.873
Alive.

26:11.004 --> 26:12.832
But you fooled us good
and proper, didn't you?

26:15.835 --> 26:17.793
You're dead.

26:17.924 --> 26:20.709
You're just a corpse
pretending to be alive.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.189
And you should have stayed

26:22.319 --> 26:23.843
-in your fucking grave!
-[Mary whimpers]

26:23.973 --> 26:25.671
