WEBVTT

00:30.447 --> 00:31.531
Alex?

00:33.533 --> 00:34.743
You in there?

00:34.826 --> 00:36.119
It's Regina.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.792
Hello?

00:44.794 --> 00:46.546
Do you not hear the knocking?

00:47.964 --> 00:48.965
Hello?

00:49.841 --> 00:50.759
Yeah.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.178
-Can I help you?
-Is Alex here?

00:54.471 --> 00:56.014
-Who's asking?
-Regina.

00:57.307 --> 01:01.269
She cleans my house sometimes
on Fisher Island.

01:01.352 --> 01:02.979
She hasn't shown up in four weeks.

01:04.606 --> 01:07.025
-How'd you get this address?
-Value Maids.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.152
Is she home?

01:10.111 --> 01:12.781
Nope. She's not here.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.617
-Do you know when she's due back?
-I don't.

01:17.994 --> 01:21.748
Well, she, um,
left her notebook at my house.

01:21.831 --> 01:24.292
And I was hoping to return it to her.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.503
Give it to me. I'll give it to her.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.963
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I don't wanna overstep,

01:29.047 --> 01:31.132
but I was hoping to return it to her.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.217
In person.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.177
Check if she's okay.

01:34.719 --> 01:35.762
She's fine.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.432
She's on the other side of this door
shaking her head "no" at me.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.850
She doesn't wanna see you.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.977
-Alex? Hey, no--
-Thank you for coming by.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.040
Can I have it?

02:05.500 --> 02:07.418
I don't like you giving this address out.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.462
Can I have the notebook?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.215
You think I'll steal it?

02:13.049 --> 02:15.176
Sean, can I please have my notebook?

02:17.387 --> 02:19.180
It's right there, crazy.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.602
Hey, why is Maddy still in her pajamas?

02:25.478 --> 02:26.729
We're about to get dressed.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.899
It's00. It's fucking embarrassing.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.360
Someone's at the door
and she's not dressed?

02:32.443 --> 02:34.404
It looks like trash lives here.

02:36.030 --> 02:39.617
She's a kid, Alex.
She should be dressed at dinnertime.

02:41.619 --> 02:42.620
You're right.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.791
I'm gonna do bathtime right now.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.258
This is really pretty.

03:42.263 --> 03:46.059
Eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.980
-Wanna go check on Candy and Sandy?
-Yes.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.484
So remind me...

03:56.861 --> 04:00.448
this is Candy and this is Sandy, right?

04:00.531 --> 04:02.992
No, that's Sandy and that's Candy.

04:03.993 --> 04:04.869
Sandy and Candy.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.664
That one is Sandy and that one is Candy.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.082
So they're both named Candy?

04:09.165 --> 04:10.625
-No.
-This is Sandy?

04:10.708 --> 04:12.502
No, that is Candy.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.546
-You think they've grown since yesterday?
-Mm-hm.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.610
Well, I guess we should go do bathtime.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.154
I guess we definitely shouldn't...

04:41.155 --> 04:42.657
jump in these puddles.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.447
Well, you can call me crazy,

06:04.530 --> 06:08.034
but I still say the Hawks win the division
this year with or without him.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.994
Okay, you're crazy.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.747
All right, gang, chow time.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.628
Come on, honeybee.
Grandpa will get you in your chair.

06:19.295 --> 06:20.880
There we go. Oh!

06:23.382 --> 06:25.259
Sean, grab me another O'Doul's, will you?

06:25.343 --> 06:27.887
Got it. Alex, what are you drinking? Pop?

06:27.970 --> 06:28.888
Alex?

06:29.430 --> 06:31.474
Alex, what do you wanna drink?

06:34.060 --> 06:35.269
I'm good, thank you.

06:40.399 --> 06:42.777
-What a feast.
-Well, Shari gets all the credit.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.112
I'm just the delivery boy.

06:45.404 --> 06:49.325
She sends her love to everybody.
She's busy with the twins today.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.662
Well, it smells delicious. Thank you.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.249
-Mind if we say grace?
-Hey, where you going?

06:56.916 --> 06:58.251
-I'm not hungry.
-Hey,

06:58.334 --> 07:00.419
your dad just brought over
a home-cooked meal.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.589
I just don't feel good,
so I'm gonna lie down for a bit.

07:04.340 --> 07:05.508
We're about to eat.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.678
It's okay.
We'll save her a plate, there's plenty.

07:08.761 --> 07:11.389
Hey... you're being fucking rude.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.308
I don't wanna eat, Sean.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.393
Sit down.

07:17.311 --> 07:20.148
-I don't wanna--
-Sit... down.

07:36.622 --> 07:37.790
Sorry about that.

07:40.084 --> 07:40.918
Where were we?

07:41.711 --> 07:42.837
You were saying grace?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.297
Yeah.

07:51.095 --> 07:54.182
Bless us, O Lord, and these, thy gifts,
which we are about to receive

07:54.265 --> 07:55.600
from thy bounty

07:55.683 --> 07:58.269
-through Christ, our Lord. Amen.
-Amen.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.315
Let's dig in.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.622
-You want one of these?
-Yeah.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.874
Oh, it's the good stuff.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.876
-Do you have a kid?
-Shh. Yeah.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.713
Yeah, she's asleep, though.
That's why we have to be quiet.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.894
Okay, I'm sorry, I won't touch it.

10:05.187 --> 10:06.772
They're very nice, Mads.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.282
Why are you home so early?

10:16.991 --> 10:17.950
I got fired.

10:20.369 --> 10:21.203
What?

10:21.829 --> 10:24.749
Fucked up the count
when I closed on Thursday.

10:24.832 --> 10:25.666
Again?

10:26.542 --> 10:27.627
Can you not?

10:27.710 --> 10:31.589
I'd like to see you count out hundreds
of dollars at30 in the fucking morning.

10:34.216 --> 10:37.053
Okay. Call Phil and explain. He loves you.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.804
Yeah, it was Phil that fired me.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.765
Fucker said I was drunk behind the bar.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.642
-Were you?
-No, Alex.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.686
I buy back shots from my regulars.

10:45.770 --> 10:49.315
That's how fucking bartending works.
It's how you make money.

10:50.399 --> 10:53.194
You know, this is when
you're supposed to make me feel better.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.988
Say that everything's gonna be fine.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.700
I don't know
that everything is gonna be fine.

11:00.993 --> 11:04.455
Or you could do that.
Make me feel fucking worse. Thanks.

11:04.538 --> 11:09.460
I'm not trying to make you feel anything.
I am just having a reaction to this news.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.213
We'll be flush
when the carpentry pans out.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.884
We need food for our daughter.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.805
Maybe you didn't hear me, Alex.
I just lost my fucking job.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.307
You could've brought food home
instead of a six-pack.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.226
Jesus fucking Christ!

11:39.115 --> 11:39.949
Maddy?

11:42.493 --> 11:43.369
Maddy?

11:47.331 --> 11:48.207
Hey, Maddy?

11:51.627 --> 11:53.546
Maddy...

11:54.380 --> 11:55.256
Maddy?

11:57.591 --> 11:58.592
Hey, Maddy?

12:04.014 --> 12:04.849
Maddy?

12:06.392 --> 12:07.643
Maddy?

12:13.691 --> 12:14.567
Maddy?

12:19.113 --> 12:20.030
Maddy?

12:24.952 --> 12:27.288
Alex? It's okay, baby.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.665
Honey, honey, honey.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.336
I'm okay.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.714
Mommy's okay.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.341
You're okay. Mommy's okay, okay?

12:42.261 --> 12:43.762
I'm so sorry.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.147
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

14:34.915 --> 14:37.167
Is there any way
I could borrow your phone?

15:00.274 --> 15:03.319
Thank you. I'm sorry.
I didn't have anybody else to call.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.571
Of course.

15:06.780 --> 15:10.868
Will you be okay
to drop us off at 351 Hurley Avenue?

15:12.119 --> 15:14.121
Would you rather go to my house?

15:15.289 --> 15:17.291
The guest room is all made up.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.420
I need to go to
that address, if that's okay.

15:31.764 --> 15:35.517
Hey. Do you need me to go in with you?

15:35.601 --> 15:38.103
Oh. You actually can't. Thank you.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.561
Hi. Come here.

17:06.734 --> 17:07.943
Same painting.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.446
Oh, they're in
all of the apartments, baby girl.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.406
Okay.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.744
We'll talk in the morning,
do your intake then.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.581
Only thing I need to know now
is are you injured

17:20.664 --> 17:23.083
or in need of any medical attention?

17:23.167 --> 17:24.376
-Is Maddy?
-No.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.629
May I have your cell phone, please?

17:28.797 --> 17:29.882
I don't have one.

17:30.632 --> 17:34.678
I don't, um-- I don't know what
I was thinking. I didn't bring anything.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.973
I don't have any money or any
of Maddy's stuff. I don't have anything.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.269
-I'll bring you guys some pajamas.
-Thank you so much.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.288
I don't know if I'm
supposed to use real names.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.915
That's entirely up to you.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.251
My real name is Alex.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.336
My real name is Danielle.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.513
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.186
The fairy is back.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.861
Come on, Mommy.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.836
The breakfast fairy came again.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.716
Thank you, food fairy.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.470
-I know what this is.
-What is it?

20:21.553 --> 20:22.763
Syrup.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.957
What's the food fairy's name, Mommy?

20:52.960 --> 20:54.211
Food Fairy?

21:41.300 --> 21:42.592
Well...

21:45.470 --> 21:46.680
Hello.

21:47.764 --> 21:50.017
-How are you feeling?
-How long was I in there?

21:50.100 --> 21:51.601
A few days.

21:52.644 --> 21:56.440
Do I need to notify anybody
that I'm here? Legally?

21:56.523 --> 22:00.944
The law gives you 21 days to notify him
when you're in an emergency shelter.

22:01.570 --> 22:05.115
Miss Maddy. How are you
doing today, sugar plum?

22:05.866 --> 22:09.119
There's a play group for
kids your age in a few minutes.

22:09.202 --> 22:10.871
Is that something you'd like to do?

22:10.954 --> 22:13.165
Do you wanna go play with some kids, Mad?

22:13.248 --> 22:15.208
Today is arts and crafts.

22:16.043 --> 22:19.713
You and I can do some intake
and then I'll take you shopping.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.216
You'll take me shopping?

22:23.300 --> 22:28.055
You had stuff with you the last time,
so you probably didn't see this, did you?

22:28.138 --> 22:30.140
No. I haven't been back here.

22:30.223 --> 22:34.394
Well, some women, when they get here,
only have the clothes on their backs,

22:34.478 --> 22:36.313
so we started this.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.987
This is the boutique,

22:44.071 --> 22:48.992
all second-hand
or donated, very gently used.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.620
There's a kids section in the corner too.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.791
This is Brandi, a fellow resident.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.544
She can help you
if you have any questions.

23:03.298 --> 23:06.259
-I don't have any money.
-Oh, it's all free.

23:07.052 --> 23:10.263
The tags are blank, just for decoration.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.473
No prices.

23:15.310 --> 23:18.688
The boutique isn't open to the public.

23:19.356 --> 23:22.734
It's just for our residents to
come in and pick out what they like,

23:22.818 --> 23:25.362
to have that sense of self again.

23:26.196 --> 23:27.197
All right?

23:29.241 --> 23:30.408
Have fun.

23:33.036 --> 23:35.872
Hey. I'm here if you need me.

23:42.629 --> 23:46.550
What size are you? We've got
more stuff in the back for spring.

23:48.677 --> 23:51.138
I'm actually gonna come back later.
Thank you, though.

23:51.221 --> 23:52.722
But you didn't get anything.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.060
I'm not really sure what--

23:58.145 --> 24:00.689
Stay there. We won't overthink it.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.732
Just gonna pull you some basics, okay?

24:04.818 --> 24:09.030
Some pants, some tees,

24:09.114 --> 24:13.118
a few pairs of socks,
a couple of sweaters.

24:14.744 --> 24:18.081
-What size is your kid?
-Four-T or five-T.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.292
We got some good shit for her too.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.170
She like unicorns?

24:24.296 --> 24:25.547
Yeah.

24:29.676 --> 24:32.679
Everybody gets overwhelmed
the first time they come in here.

24:35.140 --> 24:38.768
It's because our circuits are completely
fried by what we've been through.

24:40.729 --> 24:45.442
When I first got here, it took me
weeks to remember my favorite color.

24:53.658 --> 24:56.578
Why is there
a cash register if everything's free?

24:56.661 --> 24:58.580
So it feels normal.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.417
It doesn't feel normal.

25:04.002 --> 25:07.464
Well, I'm the one
putting pretend purchases

25:07.547 --> 25:09.799
into pretend shopping bags right now.

25:14.512 --> 25:17.307
Now you use the salt to draw
a picture or design on the paper.

25:17.390 --> 25:20.518
We have a refurbished phone
for you, just came in.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.232
Wiped clean. It's all yours.

25:25.315 --> 25:29.152
Of course, you'll have to go outside
to use it once we get service for you.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.781
The FCC has a lifeline program

25:32.864 --> 25:36.576
for discounted phone service
for people in emergency shelter.

25:37.369 --> 25:41.706
But, like all things run by the
government, there is a lot of red tape.

25:41.790 --> 25:44.042
You start by typing in your social.

25:47.003 --> 25:47.963
Um...

25:48.755 --> 25:50.715
Do you not know your social?

25:52.592 --> 25:55.136
I'm just not sure
that I'm ready because...

25:56.263 --> 25:58.473
I know he's waiting
for me in my inbox, so...

25:58.556 --> 26:01.184
Well, we won't do e-mail, then.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.603
Today is just about getting your phone on.

26:05.438 --> 26:06.564
And, um...

26:08.233 --> 26:12.988
this number is not gonna be
listed anywhere? You can't look it up?

26:14.364 --> 26:16.866
Nobody has this number but you.

27:08.752 --> 27:11.379
Please leave a message after the tone.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.924
Hey, Mom. This is Alex. I--

27:16.384 --> 27:17.927
I haven't had a phone for a minute,

27:18.011 --> 27:21.097
so I'm not sure if you've been
trying to reach me or anything,

27:21.181 --> 27:25.810
but this is my new phone number.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.438
Please don't share it with anybody.

27:29.064 --> 27:33.026
I'm just calling to see how you are,

27:33.109 --> 27:37.322
and... that's it, so...

27:38.365 --> 27:39.908
I love you. Okay.

27:46.289 --> 27:48.083
Just get whatever's organic.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.002
Regina?

27:51.086 --> 27:54.714
-Who's this?
-Sorry, this is Alex.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.591
It's Alex, your maid.

27:56.674 --> 28:01.763
Oh, Alex. I am sorry. I thought you were
the guy doing my Instacart substitutions.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.223
He keeps calling me.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.850
-Hi.
-Hi.

28:05.934 --> 28:07.477
-How you doing?
-I'm good.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.187
I'm sorry.

28:10.980 --> 28:15.735
You said I could call you any time.
Did you mean that?

28:31.918 --> 28:34.504
-Have you been here before?
-No.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.882
-Thank you.
-Still or sparkling?

28:37.966 --> 28:41.344
-Sparkling for me. Does that work for you?
-Yes.

28:41.428 --> 28:44.514
And a super-hot flat white,
right off the bat.

28:44.597 --> 28:47.600
Of course. The chef has
one addition to the menu today,

28:47.684 --> 28:52.355
a pan-fried fillet of barramundi
with an asparagus and sunchoke gremolata.

28:52.439 --> 28:53.773
Thank you.

29:04.743 --> 29:09.122
This is my treat, so please get
whatever you want. Be my guest.

29:10.165 --> 29:13.585
I should be buying you lunch,
after everything that you've done for me.

29:13.668 --> 29:16.337
Yeah, well, I invited you to lunch, so...

29:20.842 --> 29:23.303
-You look well.
-Thank you.

29:25.889 --> 29:30.018
I... It's my first time
leaving the shelter in 16 days.

29:32.854 --> 29:35.940
It was a shelter,
where you dropped me off.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.486
So how does it feel to be out?

29:43.448 --> 29:44.449
Weird.

29:56.419 --> 29:57.962
You wanna get out of here?

30:00.423 --> 30:01.257
Yes, please.

30:02.133 --> 30:06.262
So I read your notebook
that you left in my office.

30:07.388 --> 30:08.848
I wondered about that.

30:08.932 --> 30:14.187
Well, at first, I thought maybe you left
it for me, sort of a handwritten present.

30:14.854 --> 30:16.940
But somewhere around Pubes House,

30:17.023 --> 30:19.025
I realized you must have left it
by accident,

30:19.108 --> 30:21.027
and I was invading your privacy.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.447
But then I couldn't put it down.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.407
You're really good.

30:27.075 --> 30:27.909
Thank you.

30:32.372 --> 30:36.125
Who's the Porn House?
'Cause I gotta get eyes on that couple.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.169
Aww...

30:38.920 --> 30:39.879
I'll never tell.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.217
I'm the Cunt House.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.178
Um...

30:48.429 --> 30:52.016
-I didn't know you yet.
-It's okay.

30:52.725 --> 30:56.104
You passed out from hunger in my house,
and I stiffed you,

30:56.187 --> 30:58.857
failed to recognize you in public...

30:59.816 --> 31:02.068
My house was aptly named.

31:02.151 --> 31:03.820
Yeah, I stole your dog,

31:03.903 --> 31:07.407
and I drank all your good wine,
and I went into your hot tub

31:07.490 --> 31:09.450
and I had a guy from Tinder over.

31:10.702 --> 31:11.536
Really?

31:11.619 --> 31:15.039
Yeah, but nothing happened 'cause you
came home early and ruined everything.

31:19.836 --> 31:22.088
Why was your notebook in my office?

31:22.171 --> 31:26.342
I was using your computer to apply
for college while you were napping.

31:26.926 --> 31:28.094
Which college?

31:28.177 --> 31:29.888
Montana College of Fine Arts.

31:30.930 --> 31:34.726
-I got in, actually. I got a scholarship.
-Great. When do you leave?

31:35.351 --> 31:37.145
-Uh, I'm not going.
-Why not?

31:37.645 --> 31:42.567
I, um... I didn't respond
or do any of that stuff.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.944
Yeah, well, that's an easy fix.
Do you wanna go?

31:45.028 --> 31:48.948
Yes, but it's too expensive,
even with a scholarship, so...

31:49.032 --> 31:51.743
Take student loans.
Everyone has student loans.

31:51.826 --> 31:54.537
And Sean would never let me go, so...

31:54.621 --> 31:57.165
No, no, wait. Why does he get a vote?

31:57.248 --> 31:59.834
I read the notebook.
He doesn't get a vote.

32:00.376 --> 32:02.837
-We have shared custody.
-Says who?

32:02.921 --> 32:05.465
The court, laws...

32:05.548 --> 32:08.134
You know I'm a lawyer, yeah?

32:08.217 --> 32:11.304
Yeah, you're, like, a big business lawyer.

32:11.387 --> 32:15.975
Corporate law. But I have a colleague
in family law who's a fucking beast.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.478
So you find out if you can still enroll.

32:19.062 --> 32:22.148
I will text her and see
if we can set a meeting.

32:22.231 --> 32:24.192
I could never afford her, Regina.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.861
Good, she would never take your money.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.907
Why are you being nice to me?

32:31.950 --> 32:34.744
Maybe I'm not a cunt.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.461
Hi. I got into
this college in March,

32:43.544 --> 32:46.923
and I got a scholarship, but then,
because of a family emergency,

32:47.006 --> 32:48.675
I wasn't able to respond.

32:48.758 --> 32:52.303
Is it too late for me to enroll?
Great. What's the number?

32:52.387 --> 32:56.391
Hi. I'm not sure if I need registration
or the bursar's office. Can you help me?

32:56.474 --> 32:59.686
How do I check on the status
of an FAFSA form?

32:59.769 --> 33:02.105
Hi. I need to request
a FAFSA form, please.

33:02.188 --> 33:04.232
How do I know if I have a PIN?

33:14.492 --> 33:15.535
Everything okay?

33:17.078 --> 33:19.205
Yeah. He hasn't e-mailed me at all.

33:39.183 --> 33:40.226
Thank you.

33:54.532 --> 33:55.783
-Hi.
-Hi.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.745
-I'm Alex, the cleaner.
-Thank you for coming. I'm Penny.

33:59.662 --> 34:02.540
You saw in my note, right,
that I can only pay $10 an hour?

34:03.291 --> 34:04.125
Yeah, that's fine.

34:04.208 --> 34:07.378
I don't have any supplies,
so I wouldn't expect anything else.

34:07.462 --> 34:08.713
It's just that--

34:08.796 --> 34:11.841
You might see the job
and wanna ask for more money,

34:11.924 --> 34:14.886
and I need you to understand
that I can't pay more.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.764
I can't afford this at all.

34:17.847 --> 34:21.434
But I'm too pregnant to do it,
so my sister lent me money.

34:23.061 --> 34:23.895
Okay.

34:28.316 --> 34:29.233
Can I come in?

34:33.279 --> 34:35.073
This is my little secret.

34:52.423 --> 34:53.633
I'm so sorry.

34:54.884 --> 34:56.886
No. Don't be.

34:57.553 --> 34:59.680
You can back out if you want.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.434
No.

35:04.352 --> 35:05.978
You're my first customer.

35:06.062 --> 35:09.357
So there's no way I'm gonna back out.

35:10.483 --> 35:12.193
Well, it's only up from here.

35:14.278 --> 35:15.905
Do you wanna help her pack?

35:17.448 --> 35:18.282
Hi.

35:18.825 --> 35:19.784
I'm Alex.

35:20.451 --> 35:21.285
That's Stu.

35:21.994 --> 35:23.121
He's not verbal.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.251
It's nice to meet you, Stu.

35:29.252 --> 35:31.921
I have two more, but they're at school.

35:32.547 --> 35:33.881
Benji and Samara.

35:38.553 --> 35:42.265
I wanna do better than this
for my kids. I do.

35:42.849 --> 35:44.559
Hey. Of course you do.

35:46.811 --> 35:47.645
It's okay.

35:49.897 --> 35:52.567
You said in your e-mail
that you're packing?

35:52.650 --> 35:56.070
Yeah. We're moving on Saturday,
to a smaller place.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.323
That's why I need your help.
I can't take all this.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.241
No.

36:01.450 --> 36:02.994
I know it looks like junk.

36:03.661 --> 36:07.623
But it's my kids' childhoods.
You can't just throw those years away.

36:10.209 --> 36:11.043
You, uh...

36:12.795 --> 36:15.089
You also need space for them to grow.

36:20.219 --> 36:21.429
Let me help you.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.015
Okay.

37:07.141 --> 37:08.184
One more.

37:09.602 --> 37:10.853
Whoa!

38:02.280 --> 38:04.073
You have to stop. That's time.

38:04.156 --> 38:06.409
I can't pay you for more hours.

38:06.492 --> 38:09.120
-Don't worry about it.
-No. That's not right.

38:09.203 --> 38:12.957
Honestly, I'm weirdly in it now,
so I got summit fever.

38:14.417 --> 38:15.584
Hit it, Stu.

38:30.683 --> 38:31.851
Thank you so much.

38:33.102 --> 38:33.936
Thank you.

38:34.020 --> 38:37.356
I'm a member of an online support group
for hoarders.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.943
We have a hard time
keeping cleaning ladies.

38:41.027 --> 38:45.239
-Maybe I could recommend you?
-Yes. That would be great. Thank you.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.532
Great. Thank you.

39:32.495 --> 39:33.329
Hi.

40:01.232 --> 40:04.276
Hi. I'm calling to inquire
about family housing.

40:04.819 --> 40:06.779
I'll be a full-time student, yes.

40:10.741 --> 40:12.701
What's the deposit needed on that?

40:12.785 --> 40:17.039
Is there a waiver on the deposit
if that presents a financial hardship?

40:17.123 --> 40:19.959
Great. Can you connect me to that office?
Sliding scale?

40:20.042 --> 40:21.836
I'm good for exactly zero.

40:26.674 --> 40:29.593
That would be great, but I don't
have a permanent address.

40:29.677 --> 40:32.596
Could you e-mail it to me?
Is there a way to expedite that?

40:34.390 --> 40:38.602
Hi. I'm calling to digitally sign
a promissory note for my student loan.

40:38.686 --> 40:39.520
Can you help?

40:39.603 --> 40:43.065
Yes. I have it right here. It's 45612.

40:43.149 --> 40:45.693
Great. How soon
would those funds disburse?

40:45.776 --> 40:47.945
And if I did a summer semester, how soon?

40:51.323 --> 40:55.202
Langley is my mother's maiden name.
Housing begins June 7th. That's great.

40:55.286 --> 40:59.707
How do I secure that? Call FAFSA?
Okay. Can you e-mail that form to me?

41:01.750 --> 41:02.585
Thank you.

41:09.008 --> 41:11.385
Fuck. Jesus Christ, what's that smell?

41:11.927 --> 41:15.097
The owner left a carton of milk
in the back.

41:16.891 --> 41:19.101
-How many miles are on it?
-195.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.103
I'll give you 400.

41:21.687 --> 41:22.521
Sold.

41:24.023 --> 41:25.983
What do you think of our new car?

41:26.567 --> 41:29.195
-Shall we name it?
-Stinky Pot Pie.

41:29.278 --> 41:30.779
Stinky Pot Pie?

41:31.363 --> 41:34.492
What about Jade, 'cause of the color?

41:34.575 --> 41:37.453
-Stinky Pot Pie. Stinky Pot Pie.
-All right.

41:38.454 --> 41:41.290
We're gonna name you Stinky Pot Pie. Yeah?

41:41.373 --> 41:45.586
We might be missing one thing
to make it our car. What do you think?

41:45.669 --> 41:47.087
"Shoop"! "Shoop"!

42:38.180 --> 42:41.141
So first of all, your ex cannot
stop you from moving to Montana,

42:41.225 --> 42:42.601
and he will not stop you.

42:42.685 --> 42:44.311
Don't I have to get his permission?

42:44.395 --> 42:47.314
You do not.
You just inform him that you're leaving.

42:47.398 --> 42:50.985
We'll draft up something called a notice
of relocation and serve it to him.

42:51.068 --> 42:55.030
Once he agrees, you amend
your parenting plan. Then you're free.

42:55.781 --> 42:57.866
Um, what happens if he doesn't agree?

42:57.950 --> 43:00.369
Technically he has
30 days to object to the notice.

43:00.452 --> 43:03.330
If he does,
we have to go duke it out in court.

43:04.707 --> 43:05.541
Okay.

43:06.041 --> 43:08.294
Um, I don't exactly have 30 days,

43:08.377 --> 43:11.171
because I'm supposed
to move out of the shelter on the 6th,

43:11.255 --> 43:13.424
and I was hoping to go straight to Montana

43:13.507 --> 43:17.303
because that way, I wouldn't have
to pay for an apartment here in between.

43:17.386 --> 43:20.306
So I went ahead and enrolled
in a summer session

43:20.389 --> 43:22.975
and put a deposit down
on housing and everything.

43:23.058 --> 43:25.561
Do you anticipate Sean objecting
to the notice?

43:25.644 --> 43:26.478
Yes.

43:26.937 --> 43:29.982
Okay. Well, if he objects,

43:30.065 --> 43:32.109
we drop a legal A-bomb on him.

43:32.192 --> 43:36.280
We slap him with a no-contact order.
That's a restraining order.

43:36.864 --> 43:37.990
And we move for you

43:38.073 --> 43:41.118
to get immediate emergency custody
of Maddy because he's an abuser.

43:41.201 --> 43:42.703
This is a safety issue.

43:43.495 --> 43:45.581
-I can do that?
-Oh, yeah.

43:46.373 --> 43:47.458
We can keep going.

43:47.541 --> 43:52.421
We can file a police report, maybe even
get a child-endangerment charge.

43:52.504 --> 43:54.757
We can sue him
for emotional distress and damages.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.343
We can crush his soul. It just takes time.

43:58.093 --> 44:00.971
The fastest way for you
to get to Missoula for the summer

44:01.055 --> 44:03.349
is for him to just sign
the notice of relocation.

44:04.099 --> 44:04.933
Okay.

44:06.352 --> 44:07.519
Um...

44:08.145 --> 44:10.356
Who serves him the notice?

44:10.898 --> 44:14.860
Oh. Someone else. Don't worry.
We have a service we use, third party.

44:15.944 --> 44:16.945
Can I do it?

44:17.988 --> 44:18.864
Uh...

44:20.157 --> 44:22.242
I don't know if-- I mean...

44:22.826 --> 44:23.786
Is that wise?

44:24.912 --> 44:27.581
I can do it in public
or something. I just--

44:29.375 --> 44:30.292
I, uh...

44:32.920 --> 44:34.338
I wanna tell him.

44:35.297 --> 44:38.175
I want him to see
I'm not scared of him anymore.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.209
Where are we?

45:14.420 --> 45:17.798
-We're gonna look for somebody.
-Who?

45:39.528 --> 45:40.529
Mom.

45:41.029 --> 45:44.825
Oh, my goodness. Maddy girl.

45:47.327 --> 45:49.538
Oh, I've missed you.

45:51.039 --> 45:53.625
Okay, let me see
that ancestral spark in your eyes.

45:53.709 --> 45:56.753
I see it. It's still there.

45:56.837 --> 45:59.214
-Oh, my goodness. I love you.
-Hey, Mom.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.009
Hey.

46:03.260 --> 46:05.929
I didn't think that you were in town.

46:06.722 --> 46:08.015
I never left town.

46:09.850 --> 46:11.935
-I just assumed that--
-You assumed.

46:12.895 --> 46:15.856
What did you assume about me, Alex?

46:16.607 --> 46:20.819
I thought that after Basil signed you out,
that you probably didn't stick around.

46:21.487 --> 46:22.738
Well, you're wrong.

46:23.447 --> 46:27.576
I used Basil to break me out of the jail
that my daughter put me in,

46:27.659 --> 46:29.411
and then I kicked him to the curb.

46:29.495 --> 46:32.873
I got my car fixed. I got this new job.

46:32.956 --> 46:35.417
And I could not be happier.

46:35.501 --> 46:38.086
-What's going on over here?
-Oh, babe...

46:38.712 --> 46:40.422
-Break time?
-No.

46:40.506 --> 46:43.717
This is my daughter and her daughter.

46:44.968 --> 46:48.514
-You're a grandmother?
-No. My daughter has a daughter.

46:48.597 --> 46:51.600
-Babe, customer.
-Oh, yeah. Sorry, honey.

46:51.683 --> 46:53.727
Just a sec. Hey there.

46:53.810 --> 46:57.606
These lovelies are made by
a famous local artist.

46:57.689 --> 47:01.109
And they're just three for 50.
They're absolutely divine.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.946
Anyway, honey, I just wanna let you know,

47:04.029 --> 47:06.990
I'm feeling very balanced.
I'm really on my voice as an artist.

47:07.074 --> 47:08.617
And I just can't talk right now

47:08.700 --> 47:11.620
because we get a pop
at the end of the day, we're busy.

47:12.204 --> 47:15.374
Okay. Can I come back later?

47:18.168 --> 47:20.420
Are you gonna make me say it, Alex?

47:21.046 --> 47:22.589
I don't wanna talk to you.

47:24.841 --> 47:25.926
Come on, Mom.

47:26.593 --> 47:28.929
Can I just take you for a beer, please?

47:29.012 --> 47:31.306
Fine. But we're going to Portland tonight.

47:31.390 --> 47:35.435
Because Micah's got a booth there
at the flea market in the morning.

47:35.519 --> 47:37.521
Okay. What time are you back?

47:37.604 --> 47:40.315
-Babe. Customer.
-All right, hon.

47:41.275 --> 47:43.527
I don't know. Some time in the afternoon.

47:44.820 --> 47:47.906
-How's 6?
-Sure. Why not?

47:49.074 --> 47:50.242
Hey, pumpkin.

47:51.201 --> 47:53.036
-Paula.
-Yeah, babe. Okay, babe.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.706
-Come on.
-I'm working. Gotta work. See you.

47:56.290 --> 48:00.043
Hey, there. I like your goofy hat.
That's just divine.

48:00.127 --> 48:02.129
It's rock solid.

48:26.111 --> 48:29.865
-Will that be fake cash or fake credit?
-Fake cash.

48:29.948 --> 48:31.450
That's a pretty blue.

48:31.950 --> 48:34.953
It's sky blue. My favorite color.

48:36.496 --> 48:39.374
Not cobalt. Not navy. Sky blue.

49:04.566 --> 49:05.609
Hey.

49:07.235 --> 49:08.236
Sorry I'm late.

49:12.115 --> 49:15.577
-Do you wanna get a coffee before we talk?
-No, I'm fine.

49:20.999 --> 49:22.417
You look really nice.

49:23.669 --> 49:24.961
It's not for you.

49:32.928 --> 49:34.304
What's in the envelope?

49:35.972 --> 49:37.182
I'm serving you.

49:40.560 --> 49:44.523
Maddy and I are moving to Montana.
I enrolled in college.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.275
I got us family housing,

49:47.359 --> 49:50.904
and there's a day-care program
for full-time students.

49:50.987 --> 49:54.491
It's really good for us.
And we're leaving next week.

49:54.574 --> 49:57.494
This is the notice of relocation.
And here's a pen to sign it.

49:57.577 --> 49:59.162
Where's Maddy right now?

50:01.707 --> 50:05.001
-This isn't negotiable--
-I wanna know where my daughter is.

50:09.506 --> 50:13.009
You can't hold her hostage
in a DV shelter again, Alex.

50:13.802 --> 50:14.803
She's safe.

50:17.264 --> 50:20.267
You are legally obligated
to let me see my daughter.

50:20.350 --> 50:21.560
Actually, I'm not.

50:23.687 --> 50:26.606
This is good for me
and it's good for Maddy.

50:28.817 --> 50:30.944
-Sign the form and we can go.
-No.

50:32.362 --> 50:36.116
No, there is no way that I'm letting you
go to Montana with my kid.

50:36.199 --> 50:39.578
I'm doing you a favor by giving you
the opportunity to sign this right now

50:39.661 --> 50:41.788
instead of making you go to court with me,

50:41.872 --> 50:44.374
and if you don't sign it,
it's gonna get ugly for you.

50:44.458 --> 50:45.709
Ugly for me?

50:47.169 --> 50:50.088
It was you that the judge
called unfit last time.

50:50.172 --> 50:51.673
Things are different this time.

50:55.051 --> 50:57.304
I have a fancy lawyer
that would love to make sure

50:57.387 --> 51:01.057
that you never get within ten feet of me,
or Maddy, ever again.

51:02.058 --> 51:03.977
But more importantly, I know what you did.

51:06.980 --> 51:09.065
I know that I have PTSD from it.

51:11.651 --> 51:16.823
And I know that you'll never, ever,
ever control me ever again, okay?

51:21.870 --> 51:23.747
I guess I'll see you in court.

51:55.987 --> 51:58.824
If you've never seen a man blow glass,

51:58.907 --> 52:01.618
then you don't know, it's so sensual.

52:01.701 --> 52:04.955
I mean, their lips actually
go on the glass.

52:05.038 --> 52:06.790
Lip to glass.

52:06.873 --> 52:10.460
And it's dangerous.
You know, you should watch Micah.

52:10.544 --> 52:12.504
He gives demos.

52:14.256 --> 52:18.134
-So is he your boyfriend now?
-Boy, would he love that.

52:18.218 --> 52:21.304
He tells me that he loves me all the time.

52:21.388 --> 52:22.430
But, uh...

52:23.181 --> 52:26.852
You know, I got really burned by Basil.

52:26.935 --> 52:29.145
So I'm gonna take my time with Micah.

52:29.688 --> 52:35.193
Plus, uh, he still lives with his ex-wife
for a bunch of fucked-up reasons.

52:35.277 --> 52:40.156
Could we get some more
of those free chips, please?

52:42.367 --> 52:43.493
Anyway...

52:44.077 --> 52:46.288
did I tell you about the collective?

52:47.581 --> 52:49.624
-No.
-I am part of this, you know,

52:49.708 --> 52:54.337
cutting-edge group of artists, and, um...

52:54.421 --> 52:57.090
-Thanks.
-Uh, you know...

52:57.799 --> 53:00.635
They were all Micah's friends,
but now they're my friends too.

53:00.719 --> 53:04.472
They're all painters and sculptors,

53:04.556 --> 53:07.392
and we live together, we eat together...

53:08.143 --> 53:11.354
-Where do you live?
-Um, they got a...

53:11.438 --> 53:14.649
A loft down by the water, at Port Renfrew.

53:14.733 --> 53:16.735
And they set me up in a corner unit.

53:16.818 --> 53:19.362
Got a great view.
You should come check it out.

53:20.155 --> 53:25.243
But anyway, hon, what I'm trying
to tell you is I could not be better.

53:25.327 --> 53:29.664
Uh, you know, I do my art all day.
And I stay up late.

53:29.748 --> 53:32.709
Looking at the stars.
Talking to my fellow artists.

53:32.792 --> 53:35.462
-You seem really happy, Mom.
-Oh, I am, honey.

53:35.545 --> 53:40.508
I am. I mean, this whole thing with Basil
has been a real turning point for me.

53:42.218 --> 53:43.470
I'm kind of, uh...

53:45.764 --> 53:49.184
I'm kind of having
one of those moments myself right now.

53:49.768 --> 53:50.727
Oh, yeah?

53:51.853 --> 53:53.730
Yeah.

53:54.773 --> 53:55.899
I...

53:55.982 --> 53:58.193
I think I told you this, but, um...

53:59.778 --> 54:03.031
It's what I was kind of saying
about Montana.

54:03.114 --> 54:03.990
Right.

54:04.491 --> 54:06.284
You left Sean-y again.

54:07.160 --> 54:10.497
I did. Yeah. I'm moving to Missoula.

54:11.414 --> 54:12.499
Next week.

54:13.041 --> 54:14.167
And...

54:15.961 --> 54:17.253
I'm going to college.

54:19.673 --> 54:21.841
Oh.

54:21.925 --> 54:22.884
Wow.

54:30.058 --> 54:31.601
Can you afford that?

54:32.394 --> 54:34.604
No.

54:34.688 --> 54:37.482
Uh, no, I can't. But I, uh...

54:37.565 --> 54:41.987
I took out a student loan. I'm still gonna
be cleaning houses when I'm not in school.

54:42.070 --> 54:44.072
And I got family housing.

54:44.155 --> 54:48.201
And then I found a day-care program
for Maddy, so...

54:51.413 --> 54:52.706
Just like that.

54:53.873 --> 54:55.083
Out of Dodge.

55:03.633 --> 55:04.801
What do you think?

55:05.343 --> 55:07.012
God, I...

55:07.512 --> 55:09.681
I just couldn't be prouder.

55:10.974 --> 55:11.850
Well...

55:17.230 --> 55:18.106
Hey.

55:19.607 --> 55:23.403
I get credit for teaching you
how to bend towards the light, huh?

55:24.029 --> 55:26.156
I get bragging rights, okay?

55:26.781 --> 55:29.868
-I get bragging rights.
-Thanks, Mom.

55:29.951 --> 55:32.203
Hey. Hey, everybody.

55:32.287 --> 55:34.748
-My daughter's going to college.
-Okay, Mom...

55:38.918 --> 55:39.794
Oh, my God.

55:40.378 --> 55:42.338
Where you parked?
I'll walk you to your car.

55:42.422 --> 55:44.799
No. I'm fine. I'm way over there, honey.

55:44.883 --> 55:47.260
It's gonna be good for me.
I'm gonna stretch my legs.

55:47.343 --> 55:51.389
-I'm fine. Just kiss Maddy for me.
-Mom, I'll walk you to your car.

55:51.473 --> 55:53.808
Why are you being so damn dramatic?

55:55.185 --> 55:59.147
-Can we do this again before I leave?
-Sure thing, kiddo. All right.

55:59.230 --> 56:01.733
-Good night.
-Okay, weirdo.

56:05.987 --> 56:07.322
What's all this in the back?

56:07.405 --> 56:09.407
Just a bunch of flea-market shit,
you know?

56:09.491 --> 56:12.494
Hey, that was really nice,
and thanks for the beer.

56:12.577 --> 56:14.579
Tell Maddy I love her. Night.
