00:47.825 --> 00:50.316
Look, Howard.
The one in the gold hat, remember?

00:50.394 --> 00:52.385
Yeah, the man in the train robbery.

00:52.463 --> 00:54.795
They'll think whoever was here is gone.

00:59.337 --> 01:01.862
Some want to go back down
the mountains, others want to stay...

01:01.939 --> 01:04.669
and use this site as headquarters
to raid the villages.

01:04.742 --> 01:06.039
How about pouring it into them?

01:06.110 --> 01:09.602
- Bumping off as many as we can, real fast?
- No, let's hold our horses.

01:29.634 --> 01:30.896
We are federales.

01:31.335 --> 01:33.530
You know, the mounted police.

01:33.905 --> 01:36.237
If you are the police,
where are your badges?

01:36.307 --> 01:39.140
Badges? We ain't got no badges.

01:40.178 --> 01:41.907
We don't need no badges.

01:41.979 --> 01:44.447
I don't have to show you
any stinking badges.

01:44.515 --> 01:46.608
Better not come any closer.

01:49.620 --> 01:51.679
We didn't try to do you any harm.

01:52.023 --> 01:54.287
Why don't you try to be
a little more polite?

01:54.525 --> 01:57.517
Give us your gun
and we'll leave you in peace.

01:57.995 --> 01:59.860
I need my gun myself.

02:01.465 --> 02:03.592
Throw that old iron over here.

02:03.668 --> 02:05.966
We'll pick it up and go on our way.

02:06.037 --> 02:08.972
You go anyway without my gun,
and go quick.

02:11.475 --> 02:13.807
All right.

02:37.335 --> 02:40.498
Look here, amigo, you got the wrong idea.

02:41.072 --> 02:44.303
We don't want to get your gun
for nothing. We want to buy it.

02:45.509 --> 02:48.876
Look, I have a gold watch
with a gold chain...

02:49.380 --> 02:50.938
made in your own country.

02:51.182 --> 02:55.346
The watch and the chain,
they're worth at least 200 pesos.

02:55.987 --> 02:57.648
I'll change it for your gun.

02:58.723 --> 03:01.521
You better take it.
That's a good business for you.

03:01.726 --> 03:03.751
You keep your watch, I'll keep my gun.

03:04.195 --> 03:07.995
Oh, you'll keep it? You will keep it?
We won't get it?

03:08.232 --> 03:09.290
I'll show you.

04:30.981 --> 04:32.505
Anybody get hurt?

04:34.018 --> 04:35.610
Looks like we won that round.

04:36.420 --> 04:40.322
- That guy with the gold hat, ain't he...
- We spotted him, too. The train robber.

04:40.491 --> 04:42.925
- Maybe they got enough?
- I doubt it.

04:42.993 --> 04:46.394
Since they know there's four guns,
they'll be more determined than ever.

04:46.464 --> 04:50.560
- What do you suppose they'll pull next?
- No telling. All we can do is sit tight.

04:51.736 --> 04:54.534
Cody, are you all right?

05:44.688 --> 05:45.780
He's dead.

05:47.525 --> 05:49.516
Got it right through the neck.

05:50.861 --> 05:52.021
One less gun.

05:57.034 --> 05:59.298
Chopping wood for camp, that's funny.

06:00.304 --> 06:02.772
If they're up to what I think they are,
it ain't funny.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.035
- What's that?
- They're building moving barricades.

06:05.109 --> 06:06.303
An old Indian trick.

06:06.377 --> 06:09.505
They crawl and push the barricades.
You can't see where to shoot.

06:09.580 --> 06:13.983
I'd be willing to trade my share of the
mine right now for a few hand grenades.

06:14.084 --> 06:16.075
You'd better get to your posts.

06:39.443 --> 06:41.377
They're beating it.

06:48.919 --> 06:51.786
- What do you make of that?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

06:52.623 --> 06:55.023
Wait a minute,
this may be some trick to lure us out.

06:55.092 --> 06:58.653
I don't think so. They ain't
good enough actors for this kind of a trick.

07:15.646 --> 07:18.012
Hey, partner. Up here.

07:18.148 --> 07:20.639
Here's a sight if there ever was one.

07:32.096 --> 07:35.554
Federales. Look at them.
I could kiss every one of them.

07:35.633 --> 07:39.160
They must've gotten it from the villagers
there were bandits headed here.

07:39.236 --> 07:41.227
Why don't they wait here,
make a fight of it?

07:41.305 --> 07:42.863
They know all the tricks that's why.

07:42.940 --> 07:46.307
With us behind and the federales facing
them, they wouldn't have a chance.

07:46.377 --> 07:48.072
Go get them, sick them, tie them.

07:48.145 --> 07:51.171
Chew them up and don't spit them out.
Swallow them.

07:51.248 --> 07:52.237
Am I happy.

07:52.316 --> 07:55.080
Tell you the truth,
I was already eating dirt.

07:56.754 --> 07:58.483
I wonder who he is.

08:00.824 --> 08:02.553
And if he's got any folks.

08:02.626 --> 08:03.888
Supposing he has?

08:03.961 --> 08:06.020
Let's take a look at his belongings.

08:27.685 --> 08:29.084
A few hundred pesos.

08:30.321 --> 08:33.256
Name's James Cody. Dallas, Texas.

08:34.692 --> 08:37.422
A letter from Dallas, too.
It must be his home.

08:38.195 --> 08:39.822
Reckon she's his girl.

08:41.932 --> 08:43.159
Not bad.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.800
"Dear Jim: Your letter just arrived.

08:48.105 --> 08:52.098
"It was such a relief to get word
after so many months of...

08:53.544 --> 08:54.533
"silence.

08:55.579 --> 08:58.309
"I realize, of course, that...

08:58.649 --> 09:03.450
"there aren't any mailboxes
that you can drop a letter in...

09:04.321 --> 09:06.789
"out there in the wild."

09:07.224 --> 09:08.657
You better read it.

09:09.326 --> 09:12.193
"But that doesn't keep me
from worrying about you.

09:13.564 --> 09:18.092
"Little Jimmy is fine, but he misses
his daddy almost as much as I do.

09:18.435 --> 09:21.063
"He keeps asking,
'When's Daddy coming home? '

09:21.972 --> 09:24.873
"You say if you do not make
a real find this time...

09:24.942 --> 09:26.466
"you'll never go again.

09:26.977 --> 09:30.242
"I cannot begin to tell you
how my heart rejoices...

09:30.814 --> 09:33.180
"at those words, if you really mean them.

09:33.884 --> 09:36.352
"Now I feel free to tell you...

09:36.587 --> 09:39.283
"I've never thought
any material treasure...

09:39.857 --> 09:44.226
"no matter how great, is worth the pain
of these long separations.

09:46.130 --> 09:49.190
"The country is especially lovely this year.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.133
"It's been a perfect spring.
Warm rains and hardly any frost.

09:53.771 --> 09:55.966
"The fruit trees are all in bloom.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.870
"The upper orchard looks aflame...

09:59.076 --> 10:01.670
"and the lower, like after a snowstorm.

10:02.479 --> 10:04.504
"Everybody looks forward to big crops.

10:05.249 --> 10:07.410
"I do hope you are back for the harvest.

10:11.555 --> 10:15.116
"Of course, I'm hoping
that you will at last strike it rich.

10:15.592 --> 10:17.150
"It is high time for luck...

10:17.561 --> 10:19.426
"to start smiling upon you.

10:19.997 --> 10:21.828
"But just in case she doesn't...

10:22.266 --> 10:25.258
"remember we've already found
life's real treasures.

10:25.869 --> 10:28.030
"Forever yours, Helen."

10:32.776 --> 10:35.040
I guess we better dig a hole for him.

10:46.156 --> 10:48.647
- Yeah, not so good.
- Not so good as yesterday.

10:48.726 --> 10:51.126
Want my opinion?
Lt'll be a lot less from now on.

10:51.195 --> 10:53.026
We've taken
all the gold this mountain has.

10:53.097 --> 10:54.826
How much do you figure we got today?

10:54.898 --> 10:57.958
Not as much as we were aiming to collect.
Not $40,000.

10:58.035 --> 10:59.730
I'm willing to lower my hindsight.

10:59.803 --> 11:03.671
We've got upwards of $35,000 apiece.
I tell you, we ought to be plenty thankful.

11:03.741 --> 11:05.538
Let's call it quits and pack up and leave.

11:05.609 --> 11:07.668
The sooner the better
as far as I'm concerned.

11:07.745 --> 11:09.542
I don't want to keep that dame waiting.

11:09.613 --> 11:12.741
It'll take a week to break the mine,
put the mountain back in shape.

11:12.816 --> 11:13.840
Do what to the mountain?

11:13.917 --> 11:15.942
Make her look like
she was before we came.

11:16.019 --> 11:17.111
I don't get it.

11:17.187 --> 11:19.712
We wounded this place.
It's our duty to close her wounds.

11:19.790 --> 11:23.385
The least we can do to show our gratitude
for all the wealth she's given us.

11:23.460 --> 11:26.020
If you guys don't want to help me,
I'll do it alone.

11:26.597 --> 11:29.327
You talk about that mountain
like it was a real woman.

11:30.134 --> 11:32.932
She's been a lot better to me
than any woman I ever knew.

11:33.003 --> 11:35.904
Keep your shirt on, old-timer.
Sure, I'll help you.

12:15.012 --> 12:16.707
I reckon that's about everything.

12:16.780 --> 12:19.908
Each man's burros with his goods
will be his own responsibility.

12:19.983 --> 12:20.972
Come on.

12:22.853 --> 12:24.650
Goodbye, mountain, and thanks.

12:26.623 --> 12:29.114
Yeah, thanks, mountain.

12:55.152 --> 12:56.881
I've been thinking about her.

12:57.554 --> 12:59.454
Cody's widow, I mean, and the kid.

13:00.224 --> 13:01.213
You know what?

13:01.325 --> 13:05.159
We ought to give them a fourth just
as if he'd been our partner from the start.

13:05.229 --> 13:07.060
What? A fourth of all our goods?

13:07.331 --> 13:09.424
- That's right.
- Are you crazy?

13:09.499 --> 13:12.696
If not for him, we wouldn't have
walked away from that mountain.

13:12.769 --> 13:13.758
Ask Howard.

13:13.971 --> 13:16.201
The buzzard would have gotten fat
on us all right.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.867
Yeah, it might just as well have been
one of us.

13:18.942 --> 13:21.410
But it wasn't.
It's our good luck and his bad.

13:22.112 --> 13:24.512
Whatever you guys do,
I'm going to give a fourth.

13:24.581 --> 13:28.142
I got more than I need, anyhow.
Half what I got is enough to last me out.

13:28.252 --> 13:29.651
- Fourth?
- Sure.

13:29.753 --> 13:32.813
You two guys must have been born
in a revival meeting.

13:42.232 --> 13:43.699
We got company.

13:47.738 --> 13:49.137
Steady, boys.

14:21.838 --> 14:22.930
Coffee.

14:28.078 --> 14:29.443
Give him some tobacco.

14:44.461 --> 14:47.658
We give them our tobacco,
they give us theirs, I don't get it.

14:47.731 --> 14:49.892
Why not everybody smoke his own?

14:50.467 --> 14:52.332
Take some and thank them.

14:57.975 --> 14:59.738
They're after something.

15:00.577 --> 15:02.772
Takes them a while to come to the point.

15:03.113 --> 15:06.810
To say what you want right off the bat
isn't considered polite among Indians.

15:37.547 --> 15:39.572
They got nothing but time?

16:10.881 --> 16:13.714
His boy fell in the water,
they fished him out.

16:13.784 --> 16:16.582
- He ain't dead, but he just won't come to.
- Tough.

16:17.988 --> 16:19.683
I'll go have a look at the boy.

16:19.756 --> 16:22.816
I'll be back in a little while.
Before morning, probably.

16:31.368 --> 16:33.598
Look after my goods while I am gone.

17:19.215 --> 17:20.204
Tequila.

19:50.634 --> 19:53.728
Artificial respiration did it
and a few Boy Scout tricks.

19:53.803 --> 19:55.998
I think it was more shock than drowning.

19:56.072 --> 19:59.667
He hadn't swallowed much water.
Maybe he was stunned while diving.

19:59.809 --> 20:03.142
How did these Indians know we were
in this neck of the woods anyhow?

20:03.213 --> 20:07.274
When you're near their villages,
don't ask me how, they just know.

20:37.013 --> 20:38.139
What's up?

20:38.214 --> 20:40.944
He's insisting we return to his village
and be his guests.

20:41.017 --> 20:43.815
Tell him to forget it.
Tell him he don't owe us a thing.

20:54.964 --> 20:57.797
If he doesn't pay off his debt
all the saints will be angry.

20:57.867 --> 20:59.391
This is no laughing matter.

20:59.469 --> 21:03.235
I'm afraid he's determined
to take us with him, even if it means force.

21:03.306 --> 21:04.773
I'll handle this.

21:10.413 --> 21:14.042
Wait a minute. You can't fight your way
out of this. Put your guns away.

21:14.117 --> 21:17.985
Have every Indian in the mountain on
our trail. We'd be scalped in half an hour.

21:27.263 --> 21:28.753
What'd he say then?

21:28.898 --> 21:32.026
It didn't make any difference
about you guys but I have to come.

21:32.102 --> 21:34.468
- It's like that, he just wants you.
- Looks like it.

21:34.537 --> 21:36.004
Why don't you go with them?

21:36.072 --> 21:39.166
Stay a few days and we'll meet you
in Durango. We'll wait there.

21:39.242 --> 21:41.802
- What about my goods?
- Why don't you take them with you.

21:41.878 --> 21:45.712
If they found out they might forget he was
their honored guest and bump him off.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.773
What'll I do? Dump them on the ground?

21:47.851 --> 21:51.651
We'll take them with us if you want us to
and wait for you in Durango.

21:53.490 --> 21:55.685
I reckon that's about the only solution.

21:55.759 --> 21:59.559
I bet you'll remember this
the next time you try to do a good deed.

22:00.029 --> 22:03.089
Maybe after I've stayed with them
they'll give me a horse.

22:03.166 --> 22:05.100
Then I'll be a day or two behind you.

22:05.168 --> 22:07.159
That'll be swell. Good luck, Howard.

22:07.237 --> 22:09.637
Yeah, all the luck in the world.

22:09.839 --> 22:13.832
We'll be lonesome without you. But
my Sunday school teacher used to say:

22:14.411 --> 22:17.778
"You got to learn to swallow
disappointments in this sad life."

22:17.847 --> 22:19.075
Hurry up and join us.

22:19.149 --> 22:22.277
Look out for those Indian dames.
They tell me they're smart.

22:22.352 --> 22:24.513
One of them squaws might marry you.

22:25.054 --> 22:28.490
Maybe I'll do just that. Pick out
a good-looking squaw and marry her.

22:28.558 --> 22:32.016
They're easy to dress, feed and entertain.
They don't nag at you, either.

22:32.095 --> 22:33.585
So long, partners.

22:35.598 --> 22:37.259
See you in Durango.

23:36.593 --> 23:39.221
Ain't it always his burros
that won't march in line...

23:39.295 --> 23:43.163
stray off the trail and smash their packs
against the trees and rocks?

23:44.033 --> 23:48.094
I wish they'd stray off far enough
to fall down about 2,000 feet of gorge.

23:48.638 --> 23:50.936
Why'd you offer
to carry his goods for him?

23:51.007 --> 23:52.907
As if he couldn't manage by himself.

23:52.976 --> 23:55.570
He knew what he was doing
when he turned them over to us.

23:55.645 --> 23:57.579
Mighty cute of him, wasn't it?

23:58.381 --> 24:01.714
What's the use of railing against
the old man? It won't do any good.

24:01.784 --> 24:04.651
Save your breath
for the next piece of trail.

24:04.888 --> 24:07.049
I'm stopping here for the night.

24:07.223 --> 24:10.522
If you want to go on it's okay with me,
but take his burros with you.

24:10.593 --> 24:12.117
They ain't my responsibility.

24:12.195 --> 24:14.789
It's early. We can make four,
five miles more before dark.

24:14.864 --> 24:18.823
Nobody ordered you to stay here.
You can go 20 miles more for all I care.

24:20.003 --> 24:21.334
Ordered me?

24:22.639 --> 24:23.697
You?

24:25.308 --> 24:27.469
Who's ordering who to do anything?

24:27.944 --> 24:30.469
You talk like you're boss of this outfit.

24:32.715 --> 24:35.240
Maybe you are, let's hear you say it.

24:38.054 --> 24:40.113
All right, if you can't go any further.

24:40.189 --> 24:42.054
Who says I can't? Don't make me laugh.

24:42.125 --> 24:44.355
I can go four times
as far as a mug like you.

24:44.427 --> 24:48.022
But I don't want to. I could if I want to,
but I don't want to, see, mug?

24:51.401 --> 24:53.232
What's the use of hollering?

24:53.303 --> 24:56.636
We're started on something
and we've got to finish it, like it or not.

24:56.706 --> 24:58.298
We'll camp here.

25:05.615 --> 25:07.708
Wonder what the old man's doing now.

25:07.784 --> 25:11.652
Eating a meal of roast turkey
and drinking a bottle of tequila probably.

25:11.721 --> 25:14.417
This is the first day we've had
to manage without his help.

25:14.490 --> 25:16.856
Once we get the hang of it, it'll be easier.

25:16.926 --> 25:19.258
How far away
do you suppose the railroad is?

25:19.329 --> 25:22.093
- Not so far as the crow flies.
- We ain't crows.

25:23.266 --> 25:26.030
I figure we can reach the high-pass
in two days more...

25:26.102 --> 25:28.570
then it'll be three or four days
to the railroad.

25:28.638 --> 25:31.630
That's figuring no hard luck
on the trail, of course.

25:35.445 --> 25:37.140
What's the joke, Dobbsie?

25:38.915 --> 25:40.815
Aren't you going to let me in on it?

25:40.883 --> 25:43.351
In on it? Sure I will.

25:43.953 --> 25:45.045
Sure.

25:47.290 --> 25:49.724
Go ahead, spill it. What's so funny?

25:49.859 --> 25:52.828
I was thinking what a bonehead play
that old jackass made...

25:52.895 --> 25:56.422
- when he put all his goods in our keeping.
- What do you mean?

25:56.499 --> 25:59.400
Figured he'd let us do his sweating
for him, did he?

25:59.569 --> 26:02.299
- We'll show him.
- What are you getting at?

26:03.406 --> 26:05.374
Can't you see? It's all ours.

26:05.441 --> 26:08.535
We don't go back to Durango at all.
Not at all.

26:09.379 --> 26:10.641
I don't follow you.

26:10.713 --> 26:13.273
Don't be such a sap.
Where did you ever grow up?

26:13.349 --> 26:15.977
All right, to make it clear
to a dumbhead like you...

26:16.052 --> 26:19.681
we take all his goods and go straight
up north and leave the jackass flat.

26:19.756 --> 26:23.157
You aren't serious, are you? You don't
really mean what you are saying.

26:23.226 --> 26:26.195
Fred C. Dobbs don't say nothing
he don't mean.

26:28.965 --> 26:33.493
As long as I'm here and can do anything,
you won't touch the old man's goods.

26:33.670 --> 26:35.570
I know exactly what you mean.

26:35.772 --> 26:38.240
You want to take it all for yourself
and cut me out.

26:38.307 --> 26:42.573
No, I'm on the level with the old man,
like I'd be with you if you weren't here.

26:42.645 --> 26:46.081
Get off your soapbox. You only sound
foolish out here in this wilderness.

26:46.149 --> 26:47.776
I know you for what you are.

26:47.850 --> 26:51.718
For a long time I've had my suspicions
about you and now I know I've been right.

26:51.788 --> 26:55.224
- What suspicions?
- You're not putting anything over on me.

26:55.291 --> 26:56.781
I see right through you.

26:56.859 --> 27:00.351
For a long time you've wanted
to bump me off at the first opportunity...

27:00.430 --> 27:02.557
and bury me out here
in the bush like a dog...

27:02.632 --> 27:06.500
so you could take not only the old man's
goods but mine in the bargain.

27:06.969 --> 27:09.836
When you get to Durango safely
you'll have a big laugh...

27:09.906 --> 27:12.306
thinking how dumb
the old man and I were.

27:13.810 --> 27:17.075
You make another move towards me
and I'll pull the trigger.

27:18.047 --> 27:20.607
Now, get your hands up.
Come on, get them up.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.151
Was I right, or was I?

27:26.522 --> 27:30.049
You and your Sunday school talk
about protecting people's goods.

27:30.393 --> 27:33.419
You. Go on, stand up,
and take it like a man.

27:33.963 --> 27:35.328
Come on, get up.

27:38.768 --> 27:39.996
Let go of it.

27:43.272 --> 27:45.672
- The cards are dealt the other way now.
- Yeah.

27:45.742 --> 27:47.334
Now listen to me...

27:47.810 --> 27:49.539
Look, you're all wrong.

27:49.645 --> 27:52.944
Not for a moment did I ever intend
to rob you or do you any harm.

27:53.015 --> 27:54.505
Just like I said...

27:54.584 --> 27:58.042
I'd fight for you and yours
like I'd fight for the old man's.

27:58.121 --> 28:00.612
If you really mean that
give me back my gun.

28:08.598 --> 28:10.122
My pal.

28:12.368 --> 28:16.668
Wouldn't it be better the way things are
to separate tomorrow or even tonight?

28:16.739 --> 28:19.731
- That would suit you fine, wouldn't it?
- Why me more than you?

28:19.809 --> 28:23.404
So you could fall on me from behind,
sneak up and shoot me in the back.

28:23.479 --> 28:24.946
All right, I'll go first.

28:25.014 --> 28:26.982
And wait for me on the trail
to ambush me?

28:27.049 --> 28:29.279
Why wouldn't I do it now
if I meant to kill you?

28:29.352 --> 28:31.752
I'll tell you why, because you're yellow.

28:31.921 --> 28:35.880
You don't have the nerve to pull the
trigger while I'm looking you in the eye.

28:35.958 --> 28:40.054
If you think like that, there's nothing
to do but to tie you up every night.

28:45.067 --> 28:47.399
I'll tell you what. I'll make you a little bet.

28:47.470 --> 28:50.200
Three times 35 is 105.

28:50.406 --> 28:53.637
I'll bet $105,000
you go to sleep before I do.

29:33.516 --> 29:35.848
Get up there at the head of the train.

30:36.279 --> 30:37.473
Get up!

30:39.448 --> 30:43.350
The cards are dealt the other way now,
and for the last time no more shuffling.

30:43.419 --> 30:45.910
- What cards are...
- I'm going to finish this right now.

30:45.988 --> 30:48.479
I won't take orders from you
like I had to do today.

30:48.557 --> 30:52.220
- You mean you're going to murder me?
- No, brother, not murder. Your mistake.

30:52.295 --> 30:56.095
I'm doing it to save my life that you'd take
from me when I wasn't looking at you.

30:56.165 --> 30:58.793
- The old man'll catch up with you.
- He will, will he?

30:58.868 --> 31:01.735
I got an answer for that one, too.
Know what I'll tell him?

31:01.804 --> 31:05.763
I'll tell him you tied me to a tree and
made your getaway taking all our goods.

31:05.841 --> 31:07.809
He'll be looking for you and not me.

31:07.877 --> 31:11.870
Up. March. Today I had to march
to your music, now you march to mine.

31:11.948 --> 31:13.643
- Where?
- To your funeral.

31:14.884 --> 31:16.579
Come on, keep going.

31:17.353 --> 31:19.480
Get up. Sleepy?

31:20.289 --> 31:23.122
You'll be asleep soon enough.
Sound asleep.

32:02.231 --> 32:03.960
Maybe I didn't kill him.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.628
Maybe he just staggered and fell down
without being hit.

32:44.206 --> 32:46.197
You keep it, it's yours anyhow.

33:02.224 --> 33:04.920
No, they won't find him.

33:06.529 --> 33:09.498
I'll dig a hole for him
first thing in the morning.

33:16.505 --> 33:17.836
This fire...

33:18.641 --> 33:20.199
don't give much heat.

33:25.948 --> 33:27.313
Conscience.

33:28.751 --> 33:30.013
What a thing.

33:32.188 --> 33:35.521
If you believe you've got a conscience,
it'll pester you to death.

33:35.591 --> 33:38.424
But if you don't believe you've got one...

33:38.594 --> 33:40.391
what can it do to you?

33:41.130 --> 33:45.226
Makes me sick all this talking and fussing
about nonsense.

35:02.111 --> 35:04.409
Maybe I'd better leave him like he is.

35:05.147 --> 35:07.672
Ain't very likely anybody will find him.

35:08.284 --> 35:12.243
In a week, the buzzards and the ants
will have done away with him anyway.

35:15.824 --> 35:20.022
I don't know what's getting into me.
Was that really a tiger?

35:28.337 --> 35:29.326
No.

35:31.307 --> 35:34.936
What if his eyes are open, looking at me?

35:36.745 --> 35:39.805
Best thing to do
is to get to the railroad in a hurry.

36:02.538 --> 36:03.869
Burro.

36:06.308 --> 36:08.503
It's better not to have buried him.

36:08.711 --> 36:10.679
I did right, yeah.

36:12.915 --> 36:16.442
What I should have done, maybe,
was bury his clothes...

36:16.852 --> 36:19.343
and leave him to the ants
and the buzzards.

36:19.688 --> 36:20.950
Buzzards!

36:21.624 --> 36:25.025
If somebody saw them circling,
they'd know something was dead.

36:26.161 --> 36:28.322
Buzzards ain't spotted him yet.

36:29.398 --> 36:30.831
Lucky for me.

36:59.795 --> 37:00.955
Curtin!

37:10.372 --> 37:11.703
Where are you?

37:23.719 --> 37:27.155
I better get a hold of myself.
I mustn't lose my head.

37:29.325 --> 37:31.816
There's one thing certain, he ain't here.

37:33.028 --> 37:35.326
I got it. The tiger.

37:36.432 --> 37:40.869
Yeah, that's it. The tiger must have
dragged him off to his lair, that's what.

37:41.770 --> 37:45.797
Yeah, pretty soon, not even the bones
will be left to tell the story.

37:52.014 --> 37:53.879
Done as if by order.

39:35.184 --> 39:37.448
I came to in the middle of the night.

39:38.287 --> 39:40.619
My gun was on the ground beside me.

39:41.890 --> 39:45.348
He must have left it there
to make it look like suicide.

39:46.728 --> 39:50.562
I figured he'd come back in the morning
to see if I still had a flicker of life.

39:50.632 --> 39:53.226
I thought about waiting for him
and letting him have it...

39:53.302 --> 39:56.203
but there was a good chance
in my condition I might miss...

39:56.271 --> 39:58.705
so I decided to crawl away
like a poisoned dog.

39:58.774 --> 40:02.437
- Take it easy, you're talking too much.
- Don't you worry about me.

40:02.511 --> 40:05.105
I'll pull out of this if only to get that guy.

40:05.180 --> 40:09.241
It appears our fine Mr. Dobbs has made off
with our goods and is on his way north.

40:09.318 --> 40:12.344
- Yeah.
- I reckon we can't blame him too much.

40:12.421 --> 40:13.683
What do you mean?

40:13.755 --> 40:16.189
I mean, he's not a real killer, as killers go.

40:16.258 --> 40:19.056
I think he's as honest
as the next fella, or almost.

40:19.127 --> 40:22.221
The mistake was leaving you two
in the depths of the wilderness...

40:22.297 --> 40:24.265
with more than $100,000 between you.

40:24.333 --> 40:26.631
That's a big temptation, partner,
believe me.

40:26.702 --> 40:28.226
He shot me down in cold blood.

40:28.303 --> 40:31.568
After I was down he shot me
a second time just to make sure.

40:31.640 --> 40:35.098
If I was young and out there with one
of you, I'd have been tempted, too.

40:35.177 --> 40:38.237
Maybe I wouldn't have fallen,
but I reckon I would've been tempted.

40:38.313 --> 40:41.009
There now. You're almost as good as new.

40:42.084 --> 40:44.575
Now, to find that thief
and get our goods back.

40:54.296 --> 40:57.424
They're not only giving me a horse
but coming to protect me.

40:57.499 --> 40:59.126
- You ain't going.
- Who says so?

40:59.201 --> 41:01.396
You wouldn't be up to the hard riding.

41:01.470 --> 41:03.836
- You aren't leaving me behind.
- Look at you.

41:03.906 --> 41:07.433
You're weak as a kitten.
Don't worry, I'll look after our interests.

41:07.509 --> 41:08.669
I'm going.

41:08.944 --> 41:11.310
Well, I reckon you're going.

41:42.778 --> 41:44.006
Burro!

42:25.754 --> 42:26.982
Made it.

43:31.186 --> 43:33.017
Have you got any cigarettes?

43:36.391 --> 43:39.292
No, I haven't. I've got a little tobacco...

43:40.562 --> 43:42.052
if that'll do.

43:42.764 --> 43:45.562
No paper to roll it in?

43:46.301 --> 43:47.495
Papers?

43:50.472 --> 43:51.939
Here you are.

43:54.276 --> 43:56.801
- Going to Durango?
- Yeah.

43:57.979 --> 43:59.674
That's where I'm headed.

44:00.082 --> 44:02.107
I've got to sell my burros.

44:02.884 --> 44:05.546
I got to get some money.
I haven't got a red cent.

44:05.620 --> 44:06.848
Matches?

44:11.226 --> 44:13.888
Money? We need money, too.

44:14.896 --> 44:17.592
Yeah? I could use a good mule driver...

44:18.533 --> 44:20.160
maybe two or three.

44:28.009 --> 44:29.943
How much is the pay?

44:31.012 --> 44:32.309
Two pesos.

44:32.814 --> 44:35.214
Of course, I can't pay you in advance...

44:35.283 --> 44:38.446
I got to wait till I get to town
so I can get the money.

44:40.288 --> 44:42.313
Do I know you from someplace?

44:43.191 --> 44:44.783
Maybe I know you.

44:45.761 --> 44:47.956
No, I don't think so.

44:50.465 --> 44:52.626
- Are you alone?
- No.

44:54.136 --> 44:55.603
I'm not alone.

44:57.005 --> 44:59.906
I got a couple of friends
coming along on horseback.

45:00.709 --> 45:03.234
Yeah, they ought to be here any minute.

45:14.756 --> 45:16.223
That's funny.

45:16.491 --> 45:20.154
A man all by himself in bandit country
with a string of burros...

45:20.395 --> 45:23.159
and his friends behind him on horseback.

45:30.705 --> 45:32.832
Your friends must be very far behind you.

45:32.908 --> 45:35.706
Pablo cannot see any dust
even from their horses.

45:36.077 --> 45:37.669
They'll be along any minute, I tell you.

45:42.484 --> 45:45.681
I know who you are.
You're the guy in the hole.

45:46.021 --> 45:48.182
The one who wouldn't give us the rifle.

45:48.857 --> 45:51.018
I never laid eyes on you until now.

45:52.060 --> 45:54.051
What you got in the bags?

46:00.202 --> 46:03.262
- Seems to me like hides.
- Yeah.

46:05.006 --> 46:06.837
That's what they are, hides.

46:07.175 --> 46:09.473
Ought to bring in quite a lot of money.

46:10.779 --> 46:11.871
Yeah.

46:13.982 --> 46:17.782
Sure you don't want to come along
with me and help me with the burros?

46:23.959 --> 46:25.221
Burro.

46:36.104 --> 46:37.731
Get away from my burro.

46:38.173 --> 46:42.576
We can sell those burros
for just as good a price as you'd get.

46:42.644 --> 46:44.236
Get away from my burro.

46:44.312 --> 46:49.045
You can't frighten even a sick louse
with that. You can only shoot one of us...

46:49.584 --> 46:53.520
and he wouldn't mind too much.
The federales are after him anyway.

46:53.588 --> 46:55.453
So what with your gun?

46:55.991 --> 46:58.391
- We'll take that chance.
- Get back there.

52:19.948 --> 52:23.349
- Shooting.
- Volley. Execution probably.

52:45.340 --> 52:47.672
- Dobbs is dead.
- What?

52:48.276 --> 52:51.541
- Bandits got him.
- Our goods. What about our goods?

52:59.520 --> 53:02.546
- What?
- He says our goods are safe in his office.

53:04.692 --> 53:07.957
- It's not here, Howard.
- Keep your shirt on.

53:34.289 --> 53:35.415
What?

53:49.871 --> 53:52.965
He heard the bandits talking
while they were waiting to be shot.

53:53.041 --> 53:55.669
They thought it was bags of sand
hidden among the hide...

53:55.743 --> 53:58.041
to make it weigh more
when Dobbs went to sell them.

53:58.112 --> 53:59.443
Where are they?

54:07.655 --> 54:10.146
They're in the ruins outside town.
Come on!

56:32.200 --> 56:35.533
Laugh, Curtin, old boy,
it's a great joke played on us...

56:35.603 --> 56:38.231
by the lord of fate or nature,
whatever you prefer...

56:38.306 --> 56:41.901
but whoever or whatever played it
certainly had a sense of humor!

56:41.976 --> 56:44.536
The gold has gone back
to where we found it!

57:04.065 --> 57:07.523
This is worth ten months
of suffering and labor, this joke is!

57:34.662 --> 57:37.096
Well, Howard, what next I wonder?

57:37.598 --> 57:40.590
I'm all fixed as far as I'm concerned
as a medicine man.

57:40.668 --> 57:42.761
I'll have three meals a day, five if I want...

57:42.837 --> 57:45.635
roof over my head,
and a drink now and then to warm me up.

57:45.706 --> 57:48.470
I will be worshipped, fed,
and treated like a high priest...

57:48.543 --> 57:52.445
for telling people what they want to hear.
Good medicine men are born not made.

57:52.513 --> 57:54.208
Come and see me sometime, my boy.

57:54.282 --> 57:57.217
Even you'll take off your hat
when you see how respected I am.

57:57.285 --> 58:00.254
The day before yesterday,
they wanted to make me their legislature.

58:00.321 --> 58:01.618
Their whole legislature!

58:01.689 --> 58:05.455
I don't know what that means. I think
it's the highest honor they can bestow.

58:05.526 --> 58:08.324
Yeah, I'm all fixed
for the rest of my natural life.

58:08.396 --> 58:10.557
How about yourself?
What do you aim to do?

58:10.631 --> 58:12.223
I haven't got any idea.

58:12.300 --> 58:16.066
You're young. You've got plenty of time
to make three or four fortunes.

58:16.504 --> 58:19.439
You know, the worst ain't so bad
when it finally happens.

58:19.507 --> 58:22.442
Not half as bad as you figure it'll be
before it happens.

58:22.510 --> 58:24.876
I'm no worse off than I was in Tampico.

58:25.079 --> 58:27.980
I'm out a couple of hundred dollars
when you come down to it.

58:28.049 --> 58:30.483
Not very much compared
to what Dobbsie lost.

58:30.551 --> 58:32.644
Any special place you're bent on going?

58:32.720 --> 58:35.086
No, all places are the same to me.

58:35.623 --> 58:38.717
You can keep my share of what the burros
and the hides'll bring...

58:38.793 --> 58:42.820
if you use it to buy a ticket to Dallas.
See Cody's widow. Better than writing.

58:42.897 --> 58:46.799
And besides, it's July and the fruit harvest.

58:51.138 --> 58:52.400
How about it?

58:54.609 --> 58:55.871
It's a deal.

58:58.813 --> 59:00.405
Well, let's get going.

59:15.062 --> 59:17.223
- Goodbye, Curtin.
- Goodbye, Howard.

59:17.298 --> 59:19.266
- Good luck.
- Same to you.
