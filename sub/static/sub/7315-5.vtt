WEBVTT

00:06.039 --> 00:08.374
(man grunting)

00:13.346 --> 00:16.115
(panting)

00:23.256 --> 00:27.426
(panting, grunting)

00:31.331 --> 00:33.365
Hey. Hey.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.468
(indistinct talking
in distance)

00:36.470 --> 00:39.304
(chamber music plays on radio)
but he lives there.
Well...

00:39.306 --> 00:41.040
You're acting
like a child.

00:41.042 --> 00:44.209
Martha, please... If you
care about me at all,

00:44.211 --> 00:46.278
Just let me figure
it out on my own.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.514
(panting)

00:48.516 --> 00:50.182
Help! Help me!

00:50.184 --> 00:51.216
(silenced gunshot)

00:51.218 --> 00:54.119
Just drive.
(sighs)
thank you.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.323
(chamber music continues)

01:36.262 --> 01:39.364
Tony? What are you doing here?

01:39.366 --> 01:40.799
Tony: Working, tim--
trying to power through

01:40.801 --> 01:42.568
These roi's.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.436
At 7:00 in the morning?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.171
Yeah. Someone's got to.

01:46.173 --> 01:49.675
And what have you done
with the real tony?
(laughs)

01:49.677 --> 01:53.178
Gave me a chance to hit the gym,
do a little shopping.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.413
Then I got
some breakfast.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.181
Exactly how early were you up?

01:56.183 --> 01:58.884
Technically, I-I haven't slept.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.486
At all?

02:00.488 --> 02:02.855
You want to talk
about it?

02:02.857 --> 02:04.756
I feel we just did.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.659
You know,
you've been different

02:07.661 --> 02:09.528
These past few weeks, tony.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.296
How long?

02:11.298 --> 02:13.532
Well, that's kind of
a personal question, tim,

02:13.534 --> 02:16.635
But since it's
you asking...
No, how long since you've slept?

02:16.637 --> 02:19.538
(laughing)

02:19.540 --> 02:21.340
Uh...

02:21.342 --> 02:23.342
A few days--
it's not a problem.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.744
A few days is a big problem--
the body needs rest, tony.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.779
You kidding?
I've never felt more alert,

02:27.781 --> 02:30.382
More in control;
I'm totally on my game.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.251
Feelin' good, man!

02:32.253 --> 02:37.422
Gibbs:
On your feet, dinozzo.
Tony: Aah! (groans)

02:37.424 --> 02:38.690
Sorry, boss.
I didn't see you coming.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.592
I'm just getting
my work shape spaceship...

02:40.594 --> 02:41.560
Space...

02:41.562 --> 02:42.661
Ship...

02:44.464 --> 02:46.365
Work in progress.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.766
Do it later.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.334
Gibbs: Got a dead sailor
outside of baltimore.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.403
Come on.
Tony (whispers):
I need coffee.

02:53.273 --> 02:55.407
(gasps)

02:55.409 --> 02:59.178
Sleep deprivation affects
high-level cognitive functions,

02:59.180 --> 03:00.812
Cardiovascular health,

03:00.814 --> 03:03.949
Circulation...
Just googled that
on the ride over, didn't you?

03:03.951 --> 03:06.818
Side effects include
increased risk of stroke,

03:06.820 --> 03:08.820
Memory loss,
hallucinations, tony.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.822
(sighs):
What's your point?

03:10.824 --> 03:14.293
Should you really be carrying
a loaded weapon right now?
(chuckles)

03:14.295 --> 03:16.962
Look, I got some sleeping pills
at home-- I can bring them in.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.630
You trying to make me
all dorothy dandridge?

03:18.632 --> 03:19.665
Forget about it.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.733
Coffee beans.
Turbo tweak.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.869
Body is my temple.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.640
(exhales):
Ah...

03:28.642 --> 03:30.442
(groans)

03:30.444 --> 03:31.543
Holy...

03:31.545 --> 03:32.978
I need some antacid.

03:37.483 --> 03:38.917
Oh...

03:38.919 --> 03:40.819
(chuckles):
Do you re...

03:41.956 --> 03:46.892
Rather a bucolic place to die,
wouldn't you say, jethro?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.427
Depends on the cause, duck.

03:48.429 --> 03:51.763
Decidedly less bucolic,
I'm afraid.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.266
Single gunshot wound to
the back, as far as I can see.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.768
Preceded
by a brutal battle.

03:56.770 --> 03:57.869
He put up a fight.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.771
It was the environment.
These aren't

03:59.773 --> 04:01.506
Defensive wounds on his hands.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.575
They're from the trees
and the brush

04:03.577 --> 04:05.811
That he undoubtedly had
to struggle through
to get here.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.579
Nah, he was running
from somebody.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.382
Mcgee: Victim is first class
petty officer wells.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.484
24 years old.
He's a crypto tech.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.019
Just returned from
a tour in afghanistan

04:14.021 --> 04:15.954
Where he was assigned
to a security post.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.290
Park rangers discovered
his body at 6:00 a.M.

04:18.292 --> 04:19.491
Rollins hotel.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.926
It's in baltimore.
Expensive, too.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.528
I'm wondering how
an enlisted man could afford it.

04:23.530 --> 04:24.696
Check it out.

04:25.898 --> 04:28.333
Ah, dinozzo,
what are you doing?

04:28.335 --> 04:31.003
Trees?

04:36.409 --> 04:38.577
Looky-loos. They're all
dressed for something--

04:38.579 --> 04:40.612
Hiking, running,
bird-watching.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.681
Yeah, except?
The tall guy in
the green hoodie

04:42.683 --> 04:43.982
With the black
work boots.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.517
He's not dressed for anything.

04:45.519 --> 04:48.553
Where?
My six. Your 12.

04:54.594 --> 04:55.627
He was there.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.895
Well, get him back.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.302
(footsteps nearby)

05:04.504 --> 05:04.970
Hey!

05:06.306 --> 05:07.506
I know you.

05:08.741 --> 05:09.941
Come back! Ncis!

05:09.943 --> 05:11.677
Stop!

05:19.452 --> 05:20.652
(tony panting)

05:26.526 --> 05:27.926
Sorry. He disappeared.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.461
He was...

05:29.463 --> 05:30.762
(panting)

05:30.764 --> 05:32.331
Wait a minute.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.598
Are you okay, dinozzo?

05:33.600 --> 05:36.101
(panting):
Yeah, of course.

05:36.103 --> 05:39.671
It's... The guy was
standing right here, you know?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.039
I was just...

05:41.974 --> 05:43.075
Aha.

05:50.983 --> 05:53.552
"choward's scented gum."

05:53.554 --> 05:55.654
That mean something to you?

05:55.656 --> 05:58.490
Yeah.
It means mcgee's right.

05:58.492 --> 06:01.526
I'm starting to see things.

06:07.967 --> 06:09.601
(elevator bell dings)

06:10.770 --> 06:12.838
(bell dings)

06:12.840 --> 06:14.740
(grunts)

06:25.952 --> 06:27.052
Hi.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.987
Oh. Hey.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.021
Delilah.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.157
Why are you here?

06:32.159 --> 06:34.025
Oh, haven't you heard?

06:34.027 --> 06:35.694
Transfer
just came in.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.963
It's official--
I'm joining the team.

06:39.432 --> 06:40.732
Mcgee:
Careful, delilah.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.934
Tony's operating
on a serious sleep deficit.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.603
His, uh,
neurotransmitters

06:44.605 --> 06:46.138
Aren't processing
humor right now.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.873
I'm just kidding, tony.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.908
But you should really
see a doctor

06:49.910 --> 06:51.109
If you can't sleep.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.978
Prolonged insomnia
can lead to an early death.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.146
Promise?

06:54.148 --> 06:55.147
(clunking)
aah!

06:55.149 --> 06:56.982
Short temper's

06:56.984 --> 06:59.684
Also a symptom?

06:59.686 --> 07:01.086
Why are you here, delilah?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.621
I, uh...
Mcgee: Dod
sent her over

07:02.623 --> 07:05.157
Once they heard about
petty officer wells' murder.

07:05.159 --> 07:06.725
Why is the department of defense

07:06.727 --> 07:08.093
Interested in a low-level ct?

07:08.095 --> 07:11.096
Well... Petty officer wells
was not just

07:11.098 --> 07:13.031
Any crypto tech.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.599
He was an expert
in communications

07:14.601 --> 07:17.135
Network defense with top-level
security clearance.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.937
What kind of intel
did he have access to?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.472
That's classified, tony.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.641
Seriously?
No, I just always
wanted to say that.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.842
(laughs)

07:23.844 --> 07:25.877
I don't go out
into the field much.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.148
It's not his access
dod was worried about,

07:30.150 --> 07:33.051
It's the encryption codes
he utilized on a daily basis.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.619
Some of the best
the military has.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.720
Wells was an asset.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.155
And he was supposed
to report

07:37.157 --> 07:39.057
For duty at nas point mugu

07:39.059 --> 07:40.058
In california
this morning.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.660
Ooh, could I have a piece?

07:42.195 --> 07:44.229
I love grape.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.669
Tony:
Scented grape gum?

07:50.671 --> 07:52.170
You ever heard
of the food pyramid?

07:52.172 --> 07:53.505
Gum's not grape,
it's violet.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.874
And what's this?

07:57.643 --> 08:00.145
A bag of high-end
cellular telephones

08:00.147 --> 08:02.614
That just happens to match
a description of a truckload

08:02.616 --> 08:04.149
That was hijacked last night

08:04.151 --> 08:05.484
At the shipyards?

08:05.486 --> 08:07.085
I didn't do anything.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.920
Then why do you
have these?

08:08.922 --> 08:10.489
I'm holding them for a friend.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.890
What's your name?

08:11.892 --> 08:14.226
Anton markin.

08:14.228 --> 08:15.760
Well, anton markin,

08:15.762 --> 08:17.562
What we're looking at here
is a class-two felony,

08:17.564 --> 08:20.565
Which means an "atta boy"
for me, and a little
prison time for you.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.068
So why don't you do us both
a favor and tell me

08:23.070 --> 08:25.270
The name
of your friend.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.975
What was wells doing
in baltimore?

08:29.977 --> 08:32.110
(sniffs)

08:32.112 --> 08:35.080
He was living it up in
a thousand-dollar-a-night suite

08:35.082 --> 08:36.948
At the rollins hotel.

08:36.950 --> 08:40.085
On whose dime?

08:40.087 --> 08:41.953
(clears throat)
bill was paid for

08:41.955 --> 08:44.222
With an electronic check--
I'm still tracing it.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.925
Mcgee:
I searched his room,
found $10,000 cash

08:46.927 --> 08:48.693
In the room safe
along with

08:48.695 --> 08:49.961
P.O. Wells' laptop.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.663
Sent the computer
down to abby

08:51.665 --> 08:53.298
Along with the hotel
security footage.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.233
Actually, I'm going to need
to access that computer asap.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.168
Could be compartmented
information on it,

08:57.170 --> 09:00.238
"eyes only" kind of stuff.
You want to try
and take it from abby?

09:00.240 --> 09:02.807
I would like to see that.

09:05.678 --> 09:06.745
Um...

09:06.747 --> 09:07.846
That's okay.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.114
I can wait.

09:10.082 --> 09:11.783
Suit yourself.

09:14.086 --> 09:16.154
What do you got, abbs?

09:16.156 --> 09:18.590
Depends on who's asking.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.293
Did she send you?

09:21.295 --> 09:23.295
She did! I knew it!

09:23.297 --> 09:24.896
Delilah!

09:24.898 --> 09:27.065
She already told me
that I can't log on

09:27.067 --> 09:28.733
To petty officer wells'
laptop without her, gibbs.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.068
Abby...

09:30.070 --> 09:31.836
But I've got a lot of
work to do here, gibbs,

09:31.838 --> 09:33.171
So she's gonna have
to wait her turn.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.206
Abbs, abbs,
she's just doing her job.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.174
I know.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.743
I am not stalling

09:38.745 --> 09:40.145
For personal reasons, gibbs.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.247
I just need time to
put it back together.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.250
What happened?
I didn't have
permission to log on,

09:45.252 --> 09:47.752
But no one said anything
about dissection.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.888
This computer
has been suspicious

09:49.890 --> 09:51.089
Since it came
in here, gibbs.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.290
It's supposed to be
a top-of-the-line

09:52.292 --> 09:53.725
Altstar laptop, but...

09:53.727 --> 09:55.360
I noticed some details
on the casing

09:55.362 --> 09:57.295
That didn't match
the manufacturer's specs.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.197
The edges are all
unevenly grounded,

09:59.199 --> 10:01.266
And, I mean, the motherboard,
you can look for yourself.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.302
I mean, come on.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.804
It all looks like computer guts.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.772
The circuitry is abysmal.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.808
This is substandard
workmanship, it's...

10:09.810 --> 10:10.976
Shoddy hardware.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.278
This-this computer
is a liar, gibbs.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.647
It's chinese.
I mean, well,

10:15.649 --> 10:17.182
Most computers are chinese,

10:17.184 --> 10:19.918
But this one is claiming
to be an altstar laptop,

10:19.920 --> 10:22.320
And it is not--
it is an imposter.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.290
There is spyware
implanted on that chip.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.026
That's like a back door
into the computer,

10:28.028 --> 10:30.261
Accessible
from anywhere in the world.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.865
We're talking
about espionage here.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.235
Do I seem okay to you?

10:38.204 --> 10:40.271
Markedly better than
the last occupant

10:40.273 --> 10:41.706
Of that table.

10:41.708 --> 10:44.275
It's just, I can't sleep, ducky.
I've...

10:44.277 --> 10:47.045
Ever since...

10:47.047 --> 10:50.949
Uh, her absence is difficult
for all of us, tony.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.218
I didn't say...
You didn't have to.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.053
(quiet sigh)

10:55.055 --> 10:58.423
All I know is
I'm starting to see things.

10:58.425 --> 11:01.693
People...
Who aren't even there.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.995
(laughs softly)
well, you're talking to someone

11:03.997 --> 11:06.331
Who has conversations
with the dead.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.801
I found a piece of gum at
the crime scene today--

11:09.803 --> 11:12.737
Brought me back to a case
I hadn't thought about in...

11:12.739 --> 11:14.372
15 years.

11:14.374 --> 11:18.309
Small details can unleash
powerful memories.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.278
Proust's madeleine.

11:20.280 --> 11:24.382
A single bite conjured up
a seven-volume novel.

11:24.384 --> 11:27.285
Memory's not my problem.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.387
I'm afraid I'm going
<i>cuckoo's nest.</i>

11:29.389 --> 11:33.291
Well, if you feel you're
losing your grip, simply stick

11:33.293 --> 11:37.362
To what you know is real--
like this victim-- and, ah!

11:37.364 --> 11:42.167
The bullet fragment
that I have finally dislodged.

11:43.235 --> 11:45.437
(bullet fragment clinks
into bowl)

11:45.439 --> 11:47.305
And then...

11:47.307 --> 11:49.974
Think about the people
who are still here,

11:49.976 --> 11:52.343
And who are
depending on you.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.446
(quiet sigh)

11:54.448 --> 11:55.880
Tony, I went through

11:55.882 --> 11:58.049
Petty officer wells'
cell phone records.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.385
He received a dozen calls
in the last few days

12:00.387 --> 12:02.220
From a woman named amy linden.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.189
She's a private
defense contractor.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.925
I traced the payment for wells'
hotel and travel back to her.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.493
She also spent
several years working

12:08.495 --> 12:10.028
For chinese technology
companies.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.897
If wells was a spy,
she could've been his handler.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.365
Gibbs wants us
to go pick her up.

12:15.334 --> 12:17.001
Tony?

12:17.003 --> 12:18.470
Did you hear me?

12:22.408 --> 12:23.975
(snaps fingers)

12:30.416 --> 12:31.449
Hi, boss.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.785
You keep asking.
Well, I'm still

12:33.787 --> 12:36.221
Waiting for an answer.
(laughs): I'm fine.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.356
I heard everything mcgee said--
go pick up amy linden.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.291
No, no, no.
You stay put.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.463
(quietly):
Pull it together.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.767
Mcgee, come on.
You're with me.

12:50.202 --> 12:51.870
Drive safely.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.304
(phone rings)

12:56.375 --> 12:57.442
Hello?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.244
Tony.
Abby.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.346
Is she still there?

13:01.348 --> 13:03.515
Who? Wha...? Where?

13:03.517 --> 13:05.517
Delilah. Is she
still in the bullpen?

13:05.519 --> 13:07.485
(gasps)
oh.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.021
I don't see her.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.489
What do you need?

13:13.025 --> 13:14.325
Oh, good.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.060
Okay. I just wanted
to make sure

13:16.062 --> 13:17.462
That the coast
was clear

13:17.464 --> 13:19.397
Before I gave you this.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.366
It's a dna hit
on your violet gum.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.868
(clears throat)
I think we hit
the jackpot here.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.337
This guy's a fugitive--
he's wanted for stabbing

13:26.339 --> 13:28.339
A russian gangster
in baltimore

13:28.341 --> 13:30.508
A bunch of years ago.
He could totally
be our killer.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.977
And that means you're
not seeing things.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.045
And you're not crazy.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.847
I mean, not that...
Not that I...

13:35.849 --> 13:38.817
Thought you were crazy,
or that, um...

13:38.819 --> 13:42.453
Mcgee told me that you're
seeing things, 'cause he...

13:42.455 --> 13:44.088
He didn't...

13:45.825 --> 13:49.294
(siren wailing in distance)

13:50.563 --> 13:53.431
This some kind
of safe house?

13:53.433 --> 13:55.567
Does it look like
a safe house?

13:55.569 --> 13:59.270
It looks like where
you beat confessions
out of suspects.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.272
It's my apartment.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.575
I haven't had time
to decorate.
(chuckles)

14:03.577 --> 14:05.276
It's gonna take more
than throw pillows.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.611
(laughs)

14:08.147 --> 14:09.247
Oh, no.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.182
Coffee's for closers.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.451
Oh, come on, man, I've been
in a holding cell all night.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.453
And the reason you're
not on a bus to lockup

14:15.455 --> 14:17.021
Is because of me.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.023
You're welcome,
by the way.

14:19.025 --> 14:24.195
I gave you the name of
the guy from the truck
robbery, but I got to go.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.130
I have a job at a bakery--
they're not gonna

14:26.132 --> 14:28.967
Understand why I'm late.
Here's the thing:
The name you gave me--

14:28.969 --> 14:30.935
Viktor khartov--

14:30.937 --> 14:33.972
His dad, ivan,

14:33.974 --> 14:36.574
Basically runs organized crime
in east baltimore.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.509
Ivan runs a tight
organization.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.512
No outsiders. Makes it virtually
impossible to infiltrate.
No!

14:41.514 --> 14:43.314
Let me finish.
You don't have to.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.917
You're gonna ask me to be a rat;
I'm not gonna do it.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.052
I'm not gonna do it. No.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.487
Truck driver's dead.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.322
Viktor shot him,

14:51.324 --> 14:52.457
Dumped the body.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.525
I know you were there
that night.

14:54.527 --> 14:57.629
Yeah, but all I...

14:57.631 --> 15:00.999
All I did was drive,
and I waited in the car.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.270
I didn't know he killed a guy.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.472
I didn't know it.
Doesn't matter.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.574
Makes you an accessory
to a robbery...

15:09.576 --> 15:11.609
And a homicide.

15:26.025 --> 15:29.093
Look, I got a sister
who depends on me.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.962
Anton, hey, look at me.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.997
You want to take care
of your sister, you got

15:32.999 --> 15:34.499
To take care
of our problem first.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.700
It's your only way out.

15:58.657 --> 16:00.725
(door creaking)

16:12.271 --> 16:13.705
Don't move.

16:13.707 --> 16:15.974
Hello, anton.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.983
How'd you track me down?

16:24.985 --> 16:26.751
Not that hard.

16:26.753 --> 16:30.121
This is the one place in
baltimore you ever felt safe.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.457
I didn't kill that guy.
Which guy?

16:32.459 --> 16:34.425
The one you stabbed to death
15 years ago,

16:34.427 --> 16:36.361
Or the sailor you shot
last night?

16:36.363 --> 16:38.396
The sailor.
Mm. I see.

16:38.398 --> 16:42.500
Turns out he may have been
selling secrets to the chinese.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.602
So I'm sure there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation

16:44.604 --> 16:47.205
Why you were at the crime scene.
There is, actually.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.207
But in my experience,
the guy with the gun

16:49.209 --> 16:51.275
Doesn't have to explain himself.
Fair enough.

16:51.277 --> 16:52.610
Put the gun down,
we'll talk.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.212
I'm not here
to have a conversation.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.480
I'm here to warn you
to stay away.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.782
Or what, you
gonna shoot me?
If I have to.

16:57.784 --> 17:01.619
What?
No. If you were gonna shoot me,
I'd be dead.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.055
You already got one gun;
I'm not giving you another one.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.056
So let's move on.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.525
Anton...

17:07.527 --> 17:09.027
What are you doing
back in baltimore?

17:09.029 --> 17:10.294
It's complicated.

17:10.296 --> 17:11.362
I can help you.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.697
Last time you tried to help,

17:12.699 --> 17:14.632
It cost me
my life and my sister.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.134
Think I'll pass, thank you.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.769
That's right,
your sister, marie.

17:17.771 --> 17:20.538
How's she doing?
Have you been to see her?

17:20.540 --> 17:21.773
Stop asking questions.

17:21.775 --> 17:23.708
Turn around,
get on your knees. Now.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.448
Everything's
different now.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.184
I'm a federal agent;
I have pull.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.819
Wow. Congratulations.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.788
Heard you got made detective
when you threw me

17:36.790 --> 17:38.122
Under the bus,
but federal agent...

17:38.124 --> 17:39.323
I didn't throw you
under the bus.

17:39.325 --> 17:41.392
Want to know what
my life's been like, hmm?

17:41.394 --> 17:44.062
Living underground,
fake names, dead-end job--

17:44.064 --> 17:45.830
It's 15 years of nothing.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.231
Running was your
choice, anton.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.767
None of this was my choice.

17:57.176 --> 17:59.444
Tony:
Anton!

17:59.446 --> 18:01.512
(dogs barking)

18:04.283 --> 18:05.750
(vehicle approaching)

18:05.752 --> 18:07.452
(tires screech, horn honks)

18:07.454 --> 18:09.620
(angry grunt)
(horn honking)

18:11.323 --> 18:13.357
(panting)

18:17.129 --> 18:18.196
(gasps)

18:18.198 --> 18:19.430
Anton!

18:19.432 --> 18:20.798
Stop!

18:22.634 --> 18:24.135
(grunts)

18:34.813 --> 18:37.615
(phone ringing)

18:37.617 --> 18:39.450
Tony, where are you?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.119
Never mind.
I need a favor, mcgee,

18:41.121 --> 18:42.353
And it's got to stay between us.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.788
Well, that's gonna be
a little tricky,

18:43.790 --> 18:45.623
Considering we're about
to go interview amy linden.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.126
I need a current address
for marie markin.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.560
It's probably in baltimore.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.195
Markin.
Hey, isn't that the last name

18:51.197 --> 18:53.498
Of the suspect abby I.D.'d
off the violet gum?

18:53.500 --> 18:56.367
Get back to me
as soon as you can.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.270
And listen...
You can't tell gibbs.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.440
Okay.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.308
Thanks a lot. Bye.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.611
Uh, can I help you, boss?

19:06.613 --> 19:09.247
You got an interview to conduct.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.748
(quietly):
Okay.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.254
I can't recall
anyone named wells.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.556
Your company paid for
his hotel and airfare,

19:18.558 --> 19:20.291
Gave him $10,000 in cash.

19:20.293 --> 19:23.661
Sorry, not ringing
any bells.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.796
Mcgee:
We've got a dead
navy cryptologist

19:25.798 --> 19:27.532
Who might have been selling
secrets to the chinese,

19:27.534 --> 19:29.433
And you're the last
person to see him alive.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.636
It's from the rollins
hotel security camera.

19:31.638 --> 19:32.837
Yesterday.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.772
Gibbs:
That's him and that's you.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.908
Gibbs:
Ring your bell now?

19:36.910 --> 19:38.776
Tell us about
petty officer wells.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.311
I wanted him bad.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.346
But not for espionage.

19:42.348 --> 19:45.950
He was an expert cryptologist
at the end of his enlistment.

19:45.952 --> 19:49.320
Do you know how valuable
that is in the private sector?

19:49.322 --> 19:51.289
I had...

19:51.291 --> 19:54.292
Three tech companies
in a bidding war for him.

19:54.294 --> 19:57.195
You're a headhunter?
Recruitment advisor--

19:57.197 --> 19:59.964
Developing former
government personnel
with specialized skills.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.365
Why all the secrecy?

20:01.367 --> 20:02.633
My business is cutthroat.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.335
If my competitors
found out about wells,

20:04.337 --> 20:05.803
They'd have tried
to poach him.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.972
And the $10,000 we
found in his room?

20:07.974 --> 20:09.307
Signing bonus.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.676
(laughs)
just a taste, really.

20:11.678 --> 20:15.213
You have no idea the kind
of money companies will pay.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.948
How much?

20:16.950 --> 20:19.483
Just... Out of curiosity.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.619
Six figures, to start.

20:21.621 --> 20:24.222
The sky's the limit if you
have the proper skill set.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.724
You looking to make
a transition, agent mcgee?

20:29.328 --> 20:30.828
Stay put.

20:32.831 --> 20:34.365
(mouths "call me")

20:37.236 --> 20:38.903
Hi.
Abby:
Gibbs, gibbs,

20:38.905 --> 20:40.238
Gibbs, gibbs!

20:40.240 --> 20:42.340
Abbs, tell me
you got something.

20:42.342 --> 20:45.243
Bad juju, gibbs.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.612
She came down here
an hour ago, asking to look

20:47.614 --> 20:49.247
At petty officer
wells' computer,

20:49.249 --> 20:51.682
And she was all "please"
and all "thank you."

20:51.684 --> 20:53.251
She brought me this.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.285
She's just trying to be nice.

20:54.287 --> 20:57.588
I know. It's freaking
me out, man.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.889
Ballistics.

20:58.891 --> 21:02.960
But the fragments
that ducky sent down
are in bad shape.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.428
I'm scanning them
in the computer

21:04.430 --> 21:06.264
To build a 3-d model--
I'm gonna reconstruct

21:06.266 --> 21:07.832
The bullet virtually,

21:07.834 --> 21:09.467
Upload it into nibin,
but it's, like,

21:09.469 --> 21:10.801
Every time I get into it...

21:10.803 --> 21:12.970
Think I found something.

21:17.309 --> 21:19.810
So, I was going through files
on wells' computer

21:19.812 --> 21:22.680
When I saw <i>this</i>
<i>on his web browser.</i>

21:22.682 --> 21:23.781
I'm thinking it's
some kind of code,

21:23.783 --> 21:25.583
Unlike any
I've ever seen.

21:25.585 --> 21:26.717
That's not code.

21:26.719 --> 21:27.785
That's football.

21:27.787 --> 21:28.853
It is?

21:28.855 --> 21:34.492
Abby (laughs):
It's passing, rushing,
receiving, sacks.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.027
It's a player's statistics.

21:36.029 --> 21:39.797
Wells wasn't spying, he was
playing fantasy football.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.033
He had a pretty good team, too.

21:42.035 --> 21:43.401
And it looks like...

21:44.703 --> 21:46.837
...He logged
into this account

21:46.839 --> 21:48.606
An hour before
he was shot,

21:48.608 --> 21:50.574
Using someone else's
ip address.

21:50.576 --> 21:53.377
Well, figure out whose.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.314
Tony:
<i>Dinozzo.</i>

21:56.316 --> 21:58.816
I was able
to find marie markin's

21:58.818 --> 22:01.419
Place of work--
rankoff's bakery.

22:01.421 --> 22:04.422
Oh, you know it?
Tony:
Yeah, been there.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.991
Good. Now, listen,
it's your turn.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.760
You need to tell me
exactly what's going on, tony.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.362
(hangs up)

22:11.364 --> 22:13.431
Tony?

22:14.833 --> 22:16.901
Hang up on me?

22:18.570 --> 22:20.638
Boss, is that you?

22:24.743 --> 22:26.344
Who's marie markin?

22:37.422 --> 22:39.490
(door bells tinkle)

22:42.961 --> 22:44.095
(sirens blaring)

22:44.097 --> 22:46.097
Morning, officer.
Can I help you?

22:46.099 --> 22:48.432
Owners around?
No.

22:48.434 --> 22:50.368
No, my parents aren't here.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.703
How about anton markin?
He works here, doesn't he?

22:52.705 --> 22:54.138
That depends.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.706
On what?

22:55.708 --> 22:58.142
On what he did.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.643
Have you seen him?

22:59.645 --> 23:02.079
No. Supposed to be
here a few hours ago.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.882
Means no day off for me.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.984
Where is he exactly?

23:06.986 --> 23:08.552
I don't know.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.454
But if you see him,

23:10.456 --> 23:12.523
Tell him the help wanted
sign goes up tonight.

23:13.525 --> 23:16.761
Woman:
Don't take it personally.

23:16.763 --> 23:19.397
Milo's not being rude.
Just doesn't trust policemen.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.432
It's a russian thing.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.834
How about you?

23:23.836 --> 23:25.436
Do I trust policemen?

23:25.438 --> 23:26.504
Do you know anton?

23:26.506 --> 23:27.638
I should.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.473
He's my brother.

23:29.475 --> 23:31.008
Oh, marie.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.877
I'm officer dinozzo.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.879
Yeah, I know who you are.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.415
You shouldn't be here.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.717
'cause of him?
No.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.952
You never know
who else might be around.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.454
(doorbells tinkle)
look, I just...

23:43.456 --> 23:44.655
I need to find anton.

23:44.657 --> 23:45.923
He's not in trouble.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.793
Come on... Anton's almost
always in trouble.

23:50.495 --> 23:51.929
But he's a good person.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.464
I'm sure he is.

23:53.466 --> 23:55.466
But he skipped a meeting
with the detective.

23:55.468 --> 23:59.136
That detective treats him
like a criminal, and so do you.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.439
Well, technically, marie...
Technically,

24:01.441 --> 24:03.507
He's just trying
to do right by me.

24:03.509 --> 24:06.544
You know, it's just
the two of us.

24:06.546 --> 24:09.013
Anton dropped out of school
to take care of me,

24:09.015 --> 24:10.981
Keep social services away.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.517
So... Yeah,

24:13.519 --> 24:15.653
You know, he sold
some stuff he shouldn't.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.655
Like anyone else.

24:17.657 --> 24:18.989
Just to get by.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.191
(door closes,
door bells tinkle)

24:20.193 --> 24:23.527
Listen, I'm gonna
take care of him.

24:23.529 --> 24:27.531
You better...
'cause no one else ever has.

24:29.168 --> 24:32.503
You were that cop
who came around to see marie

24:32.505 --> 24:34.038
After that trouble
with her brother, right?

24:34.040 --> 24:36.574
It's been a long time.
Yes, it has.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.677
No, no, she's not been in
for a few days.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.779
You got a home address?
Yeah.

24:43.916 --> 24:48.619
After all these years
to see she still worked here.

24:48.621 --> 24:50.621
That's how it is here.

24:50.623 --> 24:53.624
We're russian. We look out
for each other like family.

25:03.068 --> 25:05.135
Oh, no.

25:06.071 --> 25:08.072
(gun clicks)

25:08.074 --> 25:09.874
(door creaks open)

25:20.952 --> 25:22.019
(door closes)

25:22.021 --> 25:24.522
(footsteps)

25:24.524 --> 25:26.524
Anton?

25:26.526 --> 25:29.226
(footsteps)

25:30.529 --> 25:32.696
Hey, boss.

25:42.274 --> 25:45.276
Got a positive hit on petty
officer wells' fingerprints.

25:45.278 --> 25:47.878
Beating he took started here.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.914
Mcgee:
Figured he got away,

25:49.916 --> 25:51.081
Fled toward the park.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.216
His attacker followed him.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.584
He finished the job.

25:53.586 --> 25:54.752
Wells served with
marie's husband,

25:54.754 --> 25:56.720
Marine sergeant
randy hollister.

25:56.722 --> 25:59.657
They worked the same security
post out of afghanistan.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.292
Hollister was killed
a couple weeks ago

26:01.294 --> 26:03.294
When his humvee flipped
during a routine patrol.

26:03.296 --> 26:05.629
Wells is paying his respects
to the widow?

26:05.631 --> 26:06.864
That's what it
looks like.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.299
And there's still
no sign of her.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.145
(sighs)

26:23.682 --> 26:25.683
Thanks, boss.

26:25.685 --> 26:28.018
Feels like
I got hit by a train.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.020
A little sleep would help.

26:30.022 --> 26:32.690
I'll take what I can get.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.792
Who's anton?

26:34.794 --> 26:39.863
Informant back when
I was in uniform.

26:39.865 --> 26:43.801
Got stuck between the
russian mob and a hard place.

26:43.803 --> 26:47.671
He ended up killing one of the
russians he was informing on.

26:47.673 --> 26:50.975
Skipped town,
left his sister marie

26:50.977 --> 26:53.844
To fend for herself.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.613
Anton kill wells?

26:55.615 --> 26:58.682
He says no.

26:58.684 --> 27:00.684
I think I believe him.

27:00.686 --> 27:02.119
(sighs)

27:02.121 --> 27:03.954
It was just one of those cases.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.189
Everything fell apart.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.790
(laughs)

27:06.792 --> 27:09.693
And you still think you
can put it back together.

27:09.695 --> 27:11.662
No.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.631
Anton's a stone cold killer.

27:13.633 --> 27:16.333
Stabbed a guy 15 times
with a screwdriver.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.736
I want to end this.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.738
If you say so.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.905
What, you think
'cause I went out

27:21.907 --> 27:23.240
On my own,
I want to save him?

27:23.242 --> 27:25.376
It's my mess.

27:25.378 --> 27:27.811
I just want to bring him in,
look him in the eye

27:27.813 --> 27:29.413
And figure out
what the hell went wrong.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.849
(sighs)

27:31.851 --> 27:33.217
The only reason
he's not in custody is

27:33.219 --> 27:34.385
He got the drop on me.

27:34.387 --> 27:37.287
Boss, I think
I found something.

27:38.990 --> 27:42.393
If you wanted him in custody,
dinozzo,

27:42.395 --> 27:44.762
He would be.

27:50.135 --> 27:52.136
(dogs barking)

27:52.138 --> 27:55.172
Got fingernail scratches and
finger smudges on the window.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.441
It's also broken.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.943
Someone trying to escape.

28:01.846 --> 28:02.813
Look at this.

28:02.815 --> 28:04.448
Tony:
That's marie's.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.016
Well, then, she's alive.

28:06.018 --> 28:06.950
Or she was.

28:06.952 --> 28:08.719
Sorry, tony.
What I meant...

28:08.721 --> 28:10.254
Tony:
I know what you meant.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.990
Marie's in trouble,
she could be dead,

28:12.992 --> 28:14.758
And we still don't know why.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.428
(banging on wood)

28:32.444 --> 28:34.278
Abby:
<i>Counterfeit altstars,</i>

28:34.280 --> 28:36.780
Gibbs. Just like wells' laptop.

28:36.782 --> 28:39.450
Down to the crappy motherboards
and the subpar coding.

28:39.452 --> 28:41.085
Delilah:
Manufactured in china

28:41.087 --> 28:43.320
At a fraction of the cost
of the genuine article,

28:43.322 --> 28:45.189
Then sold for retail
on the open market.

28:45.191 --> 28:49.093
The stash from marie's house
has a street value of $300,000.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.360
This is not espionage.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.762
No, it's smuggling.

28:51.764 --> 28:52.863
What about the spyware?

28:52.865 --> 28:54.398
That's the one
thing we got wrong.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.833
What? No spyware?

28:55.835 --> 28:57.935
Oh, no, there's spyware
in all the computers.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.737
We broke the code, too.

28:59.739 --> 29:02.740
We can tell you what
factory they were made in,

29:02.742 --> 29:05.409
And what date they
landed on u.S. Soil.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.111
But don't thank me.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.445
This one is delilah.

29:08.447 --> 29:11.815
All I did was break the code
on the operating system.

29:11.817 --> 29:13.951
Oh, don't be so modest.
Most people can't do that.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.385
Yeah, but it was
your idea, abby.

29:15.387 --> 29:16.754
I mean, without your...

29:16.756 --> 29:17.955
Oh.

29:17.957 --> 29:18.889
What'd you find?

29:18.891 --> 29:20.124
The spyware's american.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.860
Implanted in
the computers

29:22.862 --> 29:23.961
To track the men
who've been smuggling them.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.763
Abby:
These computers belong

29:25.765 --> 29:27.431
To u.S. Customs.

29:29.868 --> 29:31.468
Marie's husband,
sergeant hollister,

29:31.470 --> 29:33.070
Had a partner, jacob spoke.

29:33.072 --> 29:34.905
Six months ago, customs
raided a warehouse

29:34.907 --> 29:37.908
They arrested him
and sergeant hollister.

29:37.910 --> 29:40.811
Only problem was, they didn't
find any of the computers,

29:40.813 --> 29:43.413
So, customs cut
hollister loose.

29:43.415 --> 29:44.782
Not his partner?

29:44.784 --> 29:46.517
No. Spoke had
an outstanding

29:46.519 --> 29:48.318
Warrant for
weapons possession.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.788
They locked him up, he
was released last week.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.523
Well, maybe he came
looking for his share.

29:52.525 --> 29:53.957
Took marie instead.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.859
I checked their finances.

29:55.861 --> 29:57.528
Marie markin and her
husband had a joint account

29:57.530 --> 29:59.029
With 50 grand in it.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.465
She's got a wanted fugitive
for a brother.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.100
Her dead husband
ran the largest

30:03.102 --> 30:04.802
Computer smuggling ring
in maryland.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.537
It's worth considering
she's in on it, too.

30:06.539 --> 30:07.905
Well, let's find her.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.339
Let's get this thing
figured out-- come on.

30:09.341 --> 30:10.541
Already on it, boss.

30:10.543 --> 30:12.176
Got an address
for a jake spoke.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.311
It's a warehouse
near baltimore.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.313
Just waiting for tony
to go pick him up.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.448
(water running)

30:18.450 --> 30:20.484
(sighs)

30:20.486 --> 30:24.488
(sirens wailing in distance)

30:24.490 --> 30:26.223
What the hell you doing here?

30:26.225 --> 30:28.058
Hiding.
(door closes)

30:28.060 --> 30:31.929
Hiding in my apartment?

30:31.931 --> 30:33.997
Not even you found me.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.300
Well, detective price is
wondering where you've been.

30:36.302 --> 30:37.868
Detective price is a jerk.

30:37.870 --> 30:40.971
Yeah, he may be a jerk,
but he's the jerk

30:40.973 --> 30:43.407
Who holds your
fate in his hands.

30:43.409 --> 30:45.309
(distant shouting,
horn honking)

30:45.311 --> 30:47.845
(sighs)
viktor knows.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.348
He knows I'm working for you.

30:52.951 --> 30:54.985
What did he say?
He's got a job.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.553
Another robbery.
Wants me to drive.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.856
I'm supposed to meet tomorrow,
go over plans, but...

30:58.858 --> 30:59.957
That's fantastic.
All right.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.425
I'll call detective price.

31:01.427 --> 31:03.126
We'll set up
surveillance.
He's gonna kill me.

31:03.128 --> 31:04.928
It's nerves talking.
Calm down.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.930
Hey, look in my eyes,
officer dinozzo.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.901
Viktor khartov is gonna kill me.

31:10.903 --> 31:12.903
Anton, we're getting close.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.872
All you have to do
is go in there,

31:14.874 --> 31:18.008
Let viktor hang himself,
and you're home free.

31:19.611 --> 31:21.612
How many times
have you done this?

31:21.614 --> 31:23.480
Huh?

31:23.482 --> 31:25.916
Worked an undercover case,
protected an informant?

31:27.285 --> 31:29.286
Detective price has.

31:29.288 --> 31:32.322
And, uh, every other
cop on the detail.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.324
Look, I'm gonna go
down to the precinct,

31:34.326 --> 31:37.127
I'm gonna set everything up and
then I'm gonna come back here,

31:37.129 --> 31:40.063
And I'm not taking my eyes off
you until viktor's in cuffs.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.900
You promise me, officer dinozzo?

31:42.902 --> 31:44.935
We're in this
together, anton.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.236
I got your back.

31:49.974 --> 31:52.042
(sighs, turns off water)

31:53.611 --> 31:55.679
(sighs)

31:57.950 --> 32:00.951
And let him get away
because of it, huh?

32:00.953 --> 32:02.419
I don't know. Do you?

32:02.421 --> 32:04.421
He made a run for it. I...

32:04.423 --> 32:07.658
Drew on him,
but I couldn't pull the trigger.

32:09.961 --> 32:13.130
You would have had him on
the ground in two seconds flat.

32:13.132 --> 32:17.100
Taken out a leg,
or shot him in the ass, or...

32:17.102 --> 32:21.038
Yeah. You followed your gut.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.306
(sighs)

32:22.308 --> 32:24.675
That hasn't really
been working out...

32:24.677 --> 32:26.677
So well for me...

32:26.679 --> 32:28.946
Lately.

32:29.681 --> 32:31.982
Oh, I don't know.

32:31.984 --> 32:33.717
Maybe it's day number four
without sleep,

32:33.719 --> 32:36.186
But I can't rely on my instincts
any longer.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.255
(sighs)

32:39.357 --> 32:41.224
I was wrong to trust anton.

32:41.226 --> 32:44.695
Maybe I was wrong
about a lot of people.

32:44.697 --> 32:47.230
Are we still talking
about the case?

32:48.199 --> 32:50.200
(sighs)

32:50.202 --> 32:53.170
It's so interesting.

32:55.740 --> 32:58.041
No one will say her name.

32:58.043 --> 33:00.043
Have you noticed?

33:00.045 --> 33:02.446
It's like she's dead.

33:02.448 --> 33:05.082
Every time I look at her desk,

33:05.084 --> 33:07.150
Every time I close my eyes...

33:09.220 --> 33:12.990
...I just feel like
I made a mistake.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.992
Like I made...

33:14.994 --> 33:17.227
The wrong decision.

33:18.196 --> 33:21.064
Only, it wasn't me
who decided.

33:21.066 --> 33:23.066
So, yeah,

33:23.068 --> 33:27.104
I'm probably wrong to think
anton's innocent in all this.

33:27.106 --> 33:30.273
I'll trust you any time.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.147
Mcgee, cover the back.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.615
On it.

33:40.785 --> 33:43.320
Anton (muffled): I'll hurt you
in a thousand different ways...

33:43.322 --> 33:44.488
Then I'll kill you!

33:44.490 --> 33:46.023
Where the hell
is my sister?!

33:46.025 --> 33:47.324
Man: I don't know. I told you.
I didn't take her.

33:47.326 --> 33:49.026
Anton: You're lying!
Where is she?!

33:49.028 --> 33:50.694
Please don't hurt me, man.
I'm begging you.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.629
Ncis.
Put the weapon down now.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.331
Back off!
I'm not done with him yet!

33:54.333 --> 33:55.632
Listen to him, anton.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.770
(panting)

33:59.772 --> 34:02.172
Anton:
Back off!

34:02.174 --> 34:03.240
Anton...

34:03.242 --> 34:04.508
Listen to him.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.510
He's not messing around.

34:06.512 --> 34:08.145
Put the gun down.

34:08.147 --> 34:10.514
I'm only asking one more time.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.682
I don't know, man, I swear!

34:12.684 --> 34:15.352
Anton,

34:15.354 --> 34:17.521
Look at me.

34:18.423 --> 34:19.656
Hey, look at me.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.525
We can end this.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.293
Okay? We'll find marie.

34:23.828 --> 34:25.228
Together.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.331
I swear to you.

34:30.701 --> 34:32.335
But you got
to put the gun down.

34:35.206 --> 34:36.807
(panting)

34:43.081 --> 34:44.414
It's okay.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.594
Two nights ago, petty
officer wells was attacked

34:57.596 --> 34:59.296
At marie markin's house.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.298
So?

35:01.300 --> 35:03.500
She was abducted.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.235
And?

35:05.237 --> 35:07.671
Where is she?
I don't know.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.239
Look, I don't know
who this is, either.

35:09.241 --> 35:11.341
He had one
of your counterfeit computers.

35:11.343 --> 35:12.375
Yeah, a lot of people do.

35:12.377 --> 35:14.311
That one's dead.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.213
Are we gonna talk about the guy
who tried to kill me?

35:16.215 --> 35:17.814
No! Where's marie?

35:17.816 --> 35:19.382
Like I said, no idea.

35:19.384 --> 35:21.384
Your fingerprints
are all over her house.

35:21.386 --> 35:23.253
I spent time there.

35:23.255 --> 35:26.223
Randy was my partner
on the computer thing.

35:26.225 --> 35:27.724
Marie involved in this?

35:27.726 --> 35:29.426
The computers? No.

35:29.428 --> 35:30.560
She didn't know anything
about it.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.529
Who do you work for?

35:34.765 --> 35:36.766
I got nothing else to say.

35:36.768 --> 35:39.536
All right? Lock me up.
I'll do the time.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.505
I'm not turning on 'em.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.607
Look, I don't know
who you're afraid of,

35:43.609 --> 35:45.509
But I promise you, I'm worse.

35:49.247 --> 35:52.349
These guys aren't
from around here.

35:52.351 --> 35:54.651
They have their own code,
you know?

35:54.653 --> 35:57.187
They don't just kill you.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.189
They make you beg 'em for it.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.258
You scare me, agent gibbs.

36:01.260 --> 36:02.893
They scare me more.

36:07.231 --> 36:10.167
Gibbs, hi... Um, I was gonna
knock, but I know that

36:10.169 --> 36:11.368
You hate that,
but it's really important,

36:11.370 --> 36:13.670
That it would be okay
to pull you out,

36:13.672 --> 36:14.671
And this is really important.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.406
Abbs, abbs...

36:16.408 --> 36:18.275
I'm here. Tell me.

36:18.277 --> 36:21.578
Do you believe in fate?

36:21.580 --> 36:23.246
Abby...

36:23.248 --> 36:24.781
Like we're all
connected,

36:24.783 --> 36:27.317
And we're all a part
of some continuous circle?

36:27.319 --> 36:28.285
No.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.453
Oh.

36:30.455 --> 36:33.557
Um, well, now maybe you will.

36:33.559 --> 36:36.960
I got a hit in nibin on
the bullet that we pulled

36:36.962 --> 36:41.798
It came from a gun used
in a baltimore truck hijacking

36:41.800 --> 36:42.966
15 years ago.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.401
Tony's old case.

36:44.403 --> 36:46.403
Yeah. So, what does it mean?

36:46.405 --> 36:48.705
It means we've been questioning
the wrong guy.

36:50.341 --> 36:52.976
Thanks, abbs.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.978
Ballistics report.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.981
The gun that killed
petty officer wells

36:57.983 --> 37:00.283
Was the same gun in
your hijacking case

37:00.285 --> 37:01.718
15 years ago.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.220
This sailor's death,

37:03.222 --> 37:06.289
Marie's abduction,
is all about you.

37:06.291 --> 37:08.258
You...

37:08.260 --> 37:10.293
Killed ivan khartov's son,

37:10.295 --> 37:12.429
And they still want revenge.

37:12.431 --> 37:15.465
You told me it would be okay,
that you had my back.

37:15.467 --> 37:16.933
Come on...
That marie
would be safe.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.401
You think this is my fault?

37:18.403 --> 37:21.338
It   <i>i</i>your fault!
Really?

37:21.340 --> 37:23.373
I'm not the one
who stole cell phones,

37:23.375 --> 37:25.508
I'm not the one
who hijacked a truck,

37:25.510 --> 37:28.745
Who stabbed a russian gangster
with a screwdriver.

37:28.747 --> 37:29.913
You weren't there!

37:29.915 --> 37:31.448
You said that you would be there

37:31.450 --> 37:32.749
No matter what, and you weren't!

37:32.751 --> 37:35.285
You don't even know
what happened.

37:35.287 --> 37:36.786
Then tell me.

37:36.788 --> 37:40.357
So we can get this cleared
off the table, tell me

37:40.359 --> 37:41.992
What happened that night.

37:41.994 --> 37:44.494
I told you
viktor figured it out.

37:44.496 --> 37:46.363
How?
I don't know.
I don't know.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.632
But you left to go
to the precinct.

37:48.634 --> 37:52.969
An hour later, he shows up
at your apartment

37:52.971 --> 37:54.371
And drives me
to the shipyard.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.306
And all of his guys
were there waiting for me.

37:56.308 --> 37:57.941
I didn't have a chance
to call for help.

37:57.943 --> 38:01.378
And there was a screwdriver
in the back of the car.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.580
I didn't have a choice, tony.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.515
I didn't have a choice.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.917
Why didn't you come
to me afterwards?

38:09.787 --> 38:13.623
It looked so bad.

38:13.625 --> 38:16.893
Oh, god...
What I did to him,

38:16.895 --> 38:18.495
To ivan's son--

38:18.497 --> 38:21.831
If I was lucky,
I was going to prison.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.633
But if ivan got to me...

38:25.303 --> 38:26.436
So, I ran,

38:26.438 --> 38:28.672
And I stayed away
as long as I could.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.507
And then you came back,

38:30.509 --> 38:32.709
15 years later,
for randy's funeral.

38:32.711 --> 38:35.478
15 years. I figured,

38:35.480 --> 38:37.747
If I could be there
for the one day,

38:37.749 --> 38:41.384
Just the one day that
marie needed me the most.

38:43.587 --> 38:46.556
But they're still after me.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.558
They're still after me.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.527
And they're probably
holding her as bait.

38:52.763 --> 38:55.665
I'm gonna need names.

39:01.572 --> 39:02.972
Special agent dinozzo.

39:02.974 --> 39:05.842
Closing up, but if you want
to grab something to go.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.477
15 years ago,

39:07.479 --> 39:09.846
Someone told ivan khartov

39:09.848 --> 39:11.948
That anton was working
with the police.

39:11.950 --> 39:14.484
That someone was you.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.386
I didn't even know ivan.

39:16.388 --> 39:18.555
That's the wrong answer.
I looked at ivan's file.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.924
You picked him up from federal
prison when he was released,

39:20.926 --> 39:23.493
And then you paid his medical
bills when he got sick.

39:23.495 --> 39:24.794
So, you want to try that again?

39:26.764 --> 39:28.031
I'll tell you what--

39:28.033 --> 39:30.867
How about
I make us a fresh cup of coffee?

39:32.370 --> 39:33.136
Don't do that.

39:35.406 --> 39:36.673
Back up.

39:45.483 --> 39:49.018
(sighs)
wow.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.688
The same make and model
that killed wells,

39:51.690 --> 39:55.658
Which means you're the one who
shot wells and abducted marie.

39:55.660 --> 39:58.661
It figures you're as bad
a dirt bag as your buddy ivan.

39:58.663 --> 39:59.662
No, I was protecting her.

39:59.664 --> 40:00.864
They wanted her dead.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.665
I convinced them
to let her live,

40:02.667 --> 40:05.502
And then anton became
my responsibility, my debt.

40:05.504 --> 40:07.537
They don't forgive a debt.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.406
But, guys, you got
to believe me--

40:09.408 --> 40:11.608
I love marie; she was never
supposed to be hurt.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.143
What went wrong?

40:13.145 --> 40:15.445
She told me anton was coming
to randy's funeral.

40:15.447 --> 40:16.646
I-I had no choice.

40:16.648 --> 40:17.814
I sent some men to watch her.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.849
And two nights ago,
someone shows up,

40:19.851 --> 40:21.484
My guys held him there
at marie's house,

40:21.486 --> 40:23.052
And when I got there,
I saw it wasn't anton.

40:23.054 --> 40:27.457
That's right, and he ran,
and he shouldn't have done that.

40:27.459 --> 40:29.092
Wait. Now you're gonna blame
the dead guy for being killed?

40:29.094 --> 40:30.727
Tony:
Where's marie?
I can't.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.662
Tell us!
No, do you understand
what they will do to me?

40:32.664 --> 40:33.763
I don't care.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.064
No.
I don't...

40:35.066 --> 40:37.734
I don't care at all. Talk!

40:42.106 --> 40:45.074
Is marie okay?
Yeah.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.177
She's a little dehydrated,
that's all.

40:49.847 --> 40:53.149
The marshals are here
to take me back to baltimore.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.653
I'm sorry...

40:56.655 --> 41:01.024
About... The way
things went down.

41:01.026 --> 41:05.962
I should've done a better job
looking out for you back then.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.565
I made my choices,
you made yours.

41:08.567 --> 41:12.535
Let's just... Let's just
leave it at that.

41:12.537 --> 41:14.637
I don't want
to leave it at that.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.206
I want to help.

41:16.208 --> 41:20.610
There's one thing
I learned, tony.

41:20.612 --> 41:23.213
Just 'cause you want it,
doesn't mean it's gonna happen.

41:26.617 --> 41:28.685
Tell me about it.

41:30.588 --> 41:32.655
It's funny.

41:32.657 --> 41:34.924
Never stops me from trying.

41:41.899 --> 41:44.667
Marie.

41:47.238 --> 41:49.239
Anton.

41:49.241 --> 41:50.673
Are you okay?

41:50.675 --> 41:52.675
Marie:
I'm fine. I'm fine.

41:52.677 --> 41:54.744
Anton:
I missed you so much.

41:58.716 --> 42:00.683
You and delilah
got a hot date?

42:00.685 --> 42:03.720
Just dinner.

42:06.123 --> 42:07.790
You're welcome to join.

42:07.792 --> 42:10.793
Oh, thanks, but no thanks, tim.

42:10.795 --> 42:12.795
Not my kind of three-way.

42:12.797 --> 42:15.632
See you tomorrow, tony.

42:15.634 --> 42:17.700
Good night.

42:21.038 --> 42:24.107
Gibbs:
Hey.

42:24.109 --> 42:25.208
Go home.

42:25.210 --> 42:29.579
I just want to make sure
anton gets processed smoothly.

42:31.015 --> 42:32.148
Least I can do.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.750
Then it's off to bed.

42:33.752 --> 42:35.818
Scout's honor.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.135
(sighs)

42:53.070 --> 42:55.138
(groans)

42:58.075 --> 43:00.143
(sighs)

43:05.583 --> 43:08.651
(snoring)
