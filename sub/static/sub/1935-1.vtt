PARK SUNG-WOONG

LEE TAE-IM

02:00.626 --> 02:02.042
Who the fuck?!

03:01.917 --> 03:02.792
Son of a bitch!

07:11.126 --> 07:17.376
FOR THE EMPEROR

07:18.376 --> 07:20.751
I really don't get it.

07:20.751 --> 07:24.959
I don't know if that was a miscalculation
on his part,

07:25.126 --> 07:28.292
or limitation of his control,

07:28.417 --> 07:31.959
but he couldn't fulfill his duties as
a relief pitcher,

07:31.959 --> 07:37.167
and completely blew the lead...

07:43.876 --> 07:45.917
Where did it all begin?

07:45.917 --> 07:48.542
"Busan High Pitcher Lee Hwan leads team
to series win"

07:48.751 --> 07:50.167
"MVP Pitcher Lee Hwan"

07:50.334 --> 07:51.792
"Scouted to Red Whales"

07:51.917 --> 07:54.042
"Most Anticipated Debut"

07:54.167 --> 07:56.084
"Sudden Shoulder Injury"

07:56.334 --> 07:57.667
"Dropped to 2nd String"

08:46.167 --> 08:48.876
A walk, then a triple in the 9th,

08:48.876 --> 08:52.459
and a loss by 2 equals 50x payout.

08:53.084 --> 08:54.376
Is he really a rookie?

08:54.376 --> 08:56.917
His accuracy is one of a kind.

08:56.917 --> 08:58.417
Let's finish the deal.

08:58.584 --> 08:59.792
Fine!

08:59.792 --> 09:00.417
Hey!

09:07.959 --> 09:09.334
Everything's here?

09:09.959 --> 09:11.834
It was a few hundred short last time.

09:11.834 --> 09:14.459
Don't be a Cheapskate over pocket change.

09:16.501 --> 09:21.001
We got heavy unloaders today, play a few hands.

09:21.001 --> 09:23.001
It's littered with rich fucking posers.

09:24.459 --> 09:26.084
See you. Let's go.

09:32.334 --> 09:35.001
Hwan, let's do this again soon.

09:36.834 --> 09:38.792
You're short a bundle.

09:39.709 --> 09:43.126
Did I bring you to the 1st string
for sucking me off?

09:43.126 --> 09:45.001
Commission, asshole.

09:50.626 --> 09:52.626
Motherfucker...

09:58.626 --> 10:01.126
Incoming raid! Get out!

10:27.917 --> 10:31.376
Catch-and-release is my job as a prosecutor.

10:31.376 --> 10:34.042
Treat me to fancy sushi soon.

10:34.417 --> 10:37.001
Take care, Sang-ha.

10:38.709 --> 10:42.876
Even penny slot players are gamblers.

10:44.709 --> 10:46.834
You're lucky, Hwan.

10:50.334 --> 10:51.376
Bud!

10:52.001 --> 10:52.667
Isn't this yours?

11:09.042 --> 11:12.251
Look at 'em bruises, are you alright?

11:13.042 --> 11:14.417
It looks pretty bad.

11:16.667 --> 11:19.334
My heart fucking aches...

11:19.709 --> 11:20.501
Listen here.

11:21.376 --> 11:25.959
Loans are supposed to be paid back,
not to be forgotten.

11:26.209 --> 11:29.542
If you paid in time,
you coulda saved 'em bruises,

11:29.542 --> 11:31.334
and have a good laugh.

11:33.417 --> 11:34.917
Who the fuck?

11:35.209 --> 11:36.501
I want my money.

11:38.501 --> 11:40.584
Is that fucking mutt lost?

11:40.584 --> 11:42.209
- Here.
- Yes, sir.

11:42.501 --> 11:44.251
Listen here, you shit,

11:44.501 --> 11:45.751
you're so out of your...

11:46.126 --> 11:47.126
Wait!

11:47.751 --> 11:50.042
It's the king of game fixer, Lee...

11:52.251 --> 11:54.167
Look, look.

11:54.292 --> 11:55.292
Stop right there.

11:55.959 --> 11:58.876
You really surprised me.

11:59.001 --> 12:00.209
A tough guy, eh?

12:00.792 --> 12:03.834
I don't know what your deal is,

12:03.834 --> 12:07.209
but being an athlete means shit
in this part of town.

12:07.209 --> 12:09.834
Tossing balls now and then,

12:09.834 --> 12:12.209
and street fights are...

12:48.251 --> 12:50.001
I said I'm sorry.

12:50.001 --> 12:51.959
Fuck your fucking sorry, fucker.

12:52.251 --> 12:54.792
I need to be compensated, $10,000.

12:54.792 --> 12:55.876
Give me a card.

12:56.876 --> 12:57.876
"Hwangje Capital"

13:08.167 --> 13:09.626
-It's him?
- Yes, boss.

13:09.959 --> 13:13.042
He was kicked out for game-rigging.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.209
He's the one.

13:16.334 --> 13:17.334
Cute.

13:26.709 --> 13:29.459
You outnumbered him, yet, he still bested you?

13:29.584 --> 13:35.042
If I wanted to, I coulda smashed his spine
and every bone in his body.

13:35.209 --> 13:37.334
But we outnumbered him,

13:37.459 --> 13:39.542
so we went gentle.

13:50.709 --> 13:54.167
Hey, you'll freeze to death.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.417
Get up, mister!

13:55.417 --> 13:56.542
Out Of my way!

14:02.084 --> 14:04.001
Look at this prick.

14:05.626 --> 14:10.126
It's unacceptable to come back empty
from a collection.

14:11.167 --> 14:13.042
Jong-ho, weren't you on top of this?

14:13.751 --> 14:17.126
Rockfish still has some clout on the streets.

14:17.501 --> 14:20.792
Shit could hit the fan
if we don't tread carefully.

14:20.792 --> 14:23.292
Don't make excuses like a bitch.

14:29.001 --> 14:30.834
You're the fuck who called?

14:31.209 --> 14:33.667
This guy's a piece of work.

14:33.876 --> 14:36.126
You want a loan for the compensation?

14:36.126 --> 14:38.876
Isn't that why you wanted to see me?

14:39.167 --> 14:40.709
I don't got shit,

14:42.334 --> 14:45.376
so why shouldn't I ask a shady loan shark?

14:45.376 --> 14:48.459
Brave motherfucker, this one.

14:48.459 --> 14:49.376
Get the fuck up,

14:49.626 --> 14:52.417
if you wanna keep breathing!

14:52.417 --> 14:53.626
Enough.

14:56.376 --> 14:58.501
I did ask for you.

14:59.167 --> 15:03.251
What'll you do for the money?

15:05.292 --> 15:08.667
Shouldn't you at least have some credibility?

15:12.501 --> 15:14.626
He's called 'Rockfish,' a retired gangster.

15:15.292 --> 15:19.042
This fat fuck took off with our money.

15:19.376 --> 15:22.876
Young man, isn't life more important
than money?

15:22.876 --> 15:26.334
Don't get worked up and get killed,

15:26.334 --> 15:28.042
sit this one out and observe.

15:28.042 --> 15:29.626
See how pros do it.

15:30.001 --> 15:32.126
- Let's go!
- Yes, boss.

16:02.334 --> 16:05.334
Bring Sang-ha, you hear me?!

16:06.209 --> 16:08.876
Stay out of this, I got this!

16:08.876 --> 16:09.834
Son of a whore!

16:10.167 --> 16:11.542
Come at me!

16:29.876 --> 16:31.584
Who the fuck are you?

16:32.917 --> 16:36.209
Do you know who I am?

16:39.209 --> 16:40.167
So, you're goldfish?

16:50.084 --> 16:51.501
'Goldfish'?

16:52.626 --> 16:53.626
'Goldfish'?!

16:58.584 --> 16:59.751
Time to pay UP,

17:01.376 --> 17:03.084
if you had enough fun.

17:03.376 --> 17:04.459
Motherfucker!

17:07.209 --> 17:09.334
What the fuck...

17:53.292 --> 17:57.292
Rockfish's all but finished in Busan.

18:18.501 --> 18:19.501
Done deal?

18:20.792 --> 18:24.501
Everyone knows you now, what will you do?

18:25.876 --> 18:28.667
- Why do you care?
- Why shouldn't I?

18:29.376 --> 18:31.251
Continue working for us.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.626
You got the chops.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.917
Overconfidence alone won't put food
on the table.

18:40.709 --> 18:44.626
Either cook, or line up at a soup kitchen.

18:45.626 --> 18:47.084
If not...

18:53.251 --> 18:55.084
starve to death.

20:20.459 --> 20:22.084
When does he start?

20:22.084 --> 20:23.792
He'll report tomorrow, sir.

20:28.084 --> 20:30.459
Life's full of ironies.

20:31.376 --> 20:32.501
How's Madame Cha?

20:32.501 --> 20:34.209
She's doing well.

20:34.334 --> 20:37.251
The old man likes her too.

20:37.459 --> 20:39.876
Tell her to keep a good watch.

20:40.084 --> 20:42.209
Put him in good mood.

20:42.417 --> 20:43.001
Yes, sir.

20:58.792 --> 20:59.667
Hi!

21:07.751 --> 21:08.876
Got a boner?

21:09.042 --> 21:10.042
Let's go.

21:14.584 --> 21:16.667
Boss, he's in great shape.

21:17.167 --> 21:18.834
I picked out his clothes.

21:18.834 --> 21:21.459
He's got a good build, so everything fits.

21:21.834 --> 21:23.959
Even rags look good on him.

21:23.959 --> 21:27.959
Fuck that shit, look how skinny he is.

21:28.126 --> 21:31.459
Leave the past behind, and have a fresh start.

21:31.459 --> 21:32.334
Yes, sir.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.584
Come on, boss!

21:34.584 --> 21:37.417
He took care of a weak ass bitch,

21:37.667 --> 21:42.584
there's no need to put him on a high horse.

21:43.001 --> 21:44.792
Fucking gambler.

21:47.376 --> 21:49.417
What the fuck are you staring at?

21:49.709 --> 21:52.501
I'll fucking rip your eyes out!

21:52.751 --> 21:54.709
Boy, get up.

21:55.251 --> 21:56.792
Get the fuck up!

21:57.042 --> 21:58.042
Calm down.

22:10.251 --> 22:12.209
Hwan is now part of the family.

22:12.667 --> 22:14.001
Raise your glasses.

23:14.917 --> 23:17.126
Didn't make you for a cheap drunk.

23:17.626 --> 23:20.959
Stay with Kyung-su and learn the ropes.

23:21.292 --> 23:23.001
Yes, sir.

23:25.834 --> 23:27.459
Wait, come here.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.001
Fucking smooth.

23:41.876 --> 23:43.917
Stick it at the right height.

23:43.959 --> 23:45.751
When you're on the toilet,

23:45.751 --> 23:47.667
squeezing shit out,

23:47.667 --> 23:49.209
your soul is also released...

23:50.542 --> 23:54.959
And at that moment,
they have to see the sticker.

23:59.542 --> 24:01.084
Don't you see this?

24:01.084 --> 24:02.751
I know it's an Au-fucking-di.

24:02.751 --> 24:04.667
-It's worth more than...
- Fine, deal's over.

24:05.001 --> 24:06.459
Wait, please!

24:29.209 --> 24:30.209
Let's go.

24:31.334 --> 24:33.501
No, I'm not done here.

24:33.501 --> 24:35.292
Hold on a minute.

24:35.709 --> 24:37.292
"Click Bets - League Schedule"

24:46.292 --> 24:47.251
Let's go.

24:49.084 --> 24:51.042
Did you turn it off?

24:51.626 --> 24:53.001
I picked a few teams.

24:53.501 --> 24:54.501
You fucking nuts?!

24:57.001 --> 24:58.167
Fuck off!

24:58.667 --> 24:59.792
Hands off!

25:00.459 --> 25:02.459
Hye-jung, you're up.

25:29.501 --> 25:30.501
100 grand!

25:31.167 --> 25:32.167
200!

25:32.417 --> 25:37.334
Jackpot! Holy fucking shit!

26:35.459 --> 26:36.709
Going home?

26:40.667 --> 26:44.001
What's the most useless thing in our business?

26:44.751 --> 26:45.751
Sir?

26:46.709 --> 26:47.917
Sympathy.

26:49.167 --> 26:52.167
Sympathy won't make you rich.

26:53.417 --> 26:57.584
If you sympathize with a pig,
how'd you eat pork?

27:03.501 --> 27:05.959
So cool...

27:06.751 --> 27:08.376
You see?

27:09.959 --> 27:13.417
Once you let go of sympathy, you gain respect.

27:14.001 --> 27:15.751
Luck or skill?

27:17.001 --> 27:18.376
The betting, I mean.

27:18.584 --> 27:19.709
You play a lot?

27:20.001 --> 27:22.792
Ball players can't make bets.

27:22.792 --> 27:26.459
Baseball is all I know,
so I see the big picture quickly.

27:26.626 --> 27:30.126
Why don't you manage
our sports betting website?

27:30.667 --> 27:32.667
If you're so versed in betting,

27:33.001 --> 27:36.959
you can manipulate the odds
and game selection to our favor.

27:41.084 --> 27:44.917
Think it over and open the glove compartment.

27:50.042 --> 27:50.959
Take it.

27:52.209 --> 27:56.626
It's an older model,
but Benz is still a status symbol.

27:58.417 --> 27:59.417
I'm alright.

29:21.501 --> 29:23.584
You can't park here.

29:26.126 --> 29:27.751
I was about to leave.

29:44.084 --> 29:45.501
Got plans tomorrow?

30:44.876 --> 30:45.876
Who is he?

30:48.834 --> 30:50.584
Your pimp?

30:52.667 --> 30:53.959
Just a friend.

30:54.251 --> 30:55.584
Missy.

30:56.459 --> 30:58.501
You two rubbed uglies, haven't you?

30:59.167 --> 31:03.501
He wouldn't look at me so menacingly otherwise.

31:03.667 --> 31:04.876
Was she tasty?

31:05.167 --> 31:07.876
Her pussy still firm and tight?

31:07.876 --> 31:10.209
Who the fuck are you?!

31:10.209 --> 31:11.209
Stop it.

31:11.334 --> 31:12.292
Stop it!

33:54.792 --> 33:57.876
I thought he'd get 5 years,
but he only served 3.

33:58.251 --> 34:01.834
Cutter's not someone
who'll let bygones be bygones.

34:02.334 --> 34:04.084
Stay on full alert.

34:12.292 --> 34:15.292
Hwan, pay your respect.

34:15.292 --> 34:17.542
This is Hwangje's chairman.

34:17.958 --> 34:20.083
He takes care of our betting website.

34:20.083 --> 34:24.458
He's got the wits and punches to boot.

34:31.251 --> 34:34.626
Probably good at choking old men too.

34:38.083 --> 34:41.292
So the congressman's lobby didn't work?

34:41.626 --> 34:44.876
Buhyun Bank is tight with the ruling party.

34:46.126 --> 34:49.042
An idiot can only do so much.

34:50.501 --> 34:54.417
At least you got the casino
and hotel stakes out of this.

34:55.042 --> 34:56.001
Please ease your mind.

34:56.001 --> 34:59.334
Imagine doing it on my land,
know how much that'd be?

35:00.167 --> 35:03.126
We're not talking about a few million.

35:07.376 --> 35:09.917
Take good care of the men noted there.

35:14.167 --> 35:15.459
How did this break...

35:19.167 --> 35:23.542
I'm sorry, chairman, I'll replace it, sir.

35:23.709 --> 35:25.209
Got $500,000 on you?

35:26.667 --> 35:29.709
Bury him when you break hotel ground.

35:29.917 --> 35:32.126
Please spare me, I will...

35:32.126 --> 35:34.792
replace it with something
similar within my power.

35:35.626 --> 35:37.542
I'm sorry sir, please.

35:41.167 --> 35:43.959
Due to newly excavated relic

35:44.251 --> 35:49.417
at Blue City construction site,
development will be postponed.

35:55.626 --> 35:56.834
Checkmate.

36:07.251 --> 36:10.876
Do you see those lights?

36:11.626 --> 36:13.542
Aren't those squid boats?

36:13.542 --> 36:14.542
Right.

36:15.417 --> 36:19.167
Squid come swimming toward those lights.

36:22.209 --> 36:27.459
I guess all living things are attracted
to shiny things.

36:28.334 --> 36:30.042
- Agree?
- Yes.

36:33.292 --> 36:41.292
Funny thing is, people call those
'Lights of Night Sea'.

36:44.834 --> 36:52.834
But up close, it's a chaotic slaughterhouse.

36:57.626 --> 36:59.626
Our business is the same.

37:00.584 --> 37:06.167
If you want to succeed,
your eyes have to lit up like that.

37:08.334 --> 37:09.542
Boss...

37:12.501 --> 37:14.292
could I ask you something?

37:18.084 --> 37:21.667
Why did you take me in?

37:24.084 --> 37:27.459
I was at a point of no return.

37:28.334 --> 37:29.834
Lee Hwan.

37:31.334 --> 37:32.251
It's a great name.

37:36.376 --> 37:38.042
A name that reeks of money.

39:06.751 --> 39:08.709
"3 years later"

39:30.042 --> 39:31.417
"Hwangje Finance"

39:31.709 --> 39:33.459
Good morning, sir.

39:34.792 --> 39:38.459
Boss, how do you expect me to walk away now?

39:40.751 --> 39:42.834
Your match rigging article will be released.

39:43.834 --> 39:48.292
We finally got it legalized,
so imagine the backlash.

39:48.667 --> 39:49.751
It won't be pretty.

39:51.209 --> 39:54.626
You know full well how hard I worked on it.

39:56.834 --> 39:58.501
By yourself?

40:00.167 --> 40:04.751
Anyway, bring me the complete list
of games you fixed.

40:09.667 --> 40:12.959
Do you still go to Temptation?

40:16.584 --> 40:20.001
A dirty mop is for cleaning,
not to be used as a blanket.

40:22.501 --> 40:23.626
Remember that.

40:51.001 --> 40:56.251
Shouldn't you be on
a debt collection run somewhere?

40:56.751 --> 40:58.751
Here to boost my business?

40:59.542 --> 41:01.626
What a fucking day...

41:02.667 --> 41:04.584
Look at this bitch!

41:05.626 --> 41:09.251
Your promotion isn't your fucking high horse.

41:14.251 --> 41:16.251
Did I beg for it?

41:33.626 --> 41:35.584
He went too far this time.

41:35.709 --> 41:37.709
Isn't it time to cut him loose?

41:40.167 --> 41:41.167
Tae-mu.

41:42.376 --> 41:45.126
We're going on 15 years, right?

41:47.042 --> 41:50.626
Why do you think I've kept you?

41:51.209 --> 41:52.209
Sir?

41:54.376 --> 41:56.376
I don't know...

41:58.834 --> 42:02.042
Some unique qualities?

42:04.042 --> 42:06.542
You were always by my side.

42:07.251 --> 42:12.501
I won't turn my back on members
of my family first.

42:13.584 --> 42:17.126
I'll give Hwan a warning,

42:17.126 --> 42:19.584
take care of your own boys.

42:21.459 --> 42:23.459
There's another pressing matter.

42:25.417 --> 42:29.042
Cutter will be out soon.

42:32.251 --> 42:35.251
"Busan Penitentiary"

42:48.126 --> 42:52.209
Only the hungry grabs the fishing pole.

42:53.042 --> 42:58.042
Are you using Hwan as your bait?

43:01.959 --> 43:02.667
Speak of the devil.

43:08.376 --> 43:12.459
I don't own anything.

43:13.292 --> 43:15.376
Money has no master.

43:16.042 --> 43:18.834
Money only lets out a scent.

43:20.376 --> 43:24.834
That scent is the sweetest in the world.

43:25.209 --> 43:29.167
But once you taste it, it turns into poison,

43:29.334 --> 43:32.626
and rot you from inside.

43:33.292 --> 43:36.751
I know you desire to be rich.

43:37.417 --> 43:42.959
Then only chase the scent.

43:49.417 --> 43:50.376
Are you sure?

43:51.667 --> 43:56.126
Boss, Hwan is with the old man.

43:58.001 --> 44:00.459
Could he be dipping into a different pocket,

44:00.459 --> 44:02.209
because you pulled him out?

44:03.084 --> 44:08.084
He may feel cornered,
there's nothing he won't do,

44:23.626 --> 44:24.792
Welcome.

44:28.417 --> 44:33.292
The news of Marina sector
seeking private capital will be out soon.

44:33.917 --> 44:39.459
Won't it look great with a few yachts,
and a resort over there?

44:40.292 --> 44:41.792
Sounds very expensive.

44:43.334 --> 44:47.251
Business is done not with money,
but with people.

44:49.876 --> 44:54.542
Indeed, the chairman's influence
casts a wide net.

44:56.334 --> 44:57.459
Congratulations, sir.

44:58.209 --> 44:59.709
No need for that.

45:00.667 --> 45:02.459
I'm still just a front.

45:03.959 --> 45:08.876
We must free ourselves from our sponsors
and stand tall.

45:09.084 --> 45:09.876
Agreed?

45:17.542 --> 45:20.376
Don't lose sleep over the website.

45:21.917 --> 45:24.292
Can't live forever on fringes of the law.

45:25.917 --> 45:29.376
I know you worked so hard
to relocate the servers.

45:30.126 --> 45:34.167
It's fine, don't fret it sir.

45:35.709 --> 45:40.542
If this takes off, I'm leaving
the loan business behind.

45:43.459 --> 45:44.792
From here on,

45:46.667 --> 45:48.792
these are our future.

45:51.709 --> 45:52.709
Very nice.

45:54.251 --> 45:58.792
I need a good sponsor and stand tall too.

46:06.209 --> 46:08.084
Where were you in the afternoon?

46:08.584 --> 46:10.334
Kyung-su was looking for you.

46:13.917 --> 46:17.417
I had things to take care of.

46:22.292 --> 46:23.501
Yeah?

46:37.084 --> 46:41.251
You can't do everything you desire to do,

46:41.792 --> 46:45.792
and become someone you desire.

46:46.959 --> 46:51.042
We all have pre-destined paths.

46:54.959 --> 47:01.917
If you know your place in life,

47:03.084 --> 47:05.251
everything'd be easy.

47:05.959 --> 47:09.459
I guess it's not always so obvious.

47:12.709 --> 47:18.834
I hope you still prefer old man's cock.

47:56.126 --> 47:57.584
Why are you so late?

48:12.209 --> 48:14.542
Did you have a VIP or something?

48:16.167 --> 48:18.042
Did Sang-ha tell you?

48:21.667 --> 48:24.792
All I got is this body...

48:27.126 --> 48:30.001
If they're paying, what can I not do?

48:31.126 --> 48:33.542
Loan without any interest...

48:35.042 --> 48:36.667
Nothing I can't do.

48:52.917 --> 48:56.834
Madame Cha's debt...is significant.

48:57.292 --> 48:58.792
I'll take care of it.

49:06.167 --> 49:08.542
So you'll blanket the mop?

49:19.834 --> 49:23.459
Transfer Cha's debt to Hwan.

49:26.584 --> 49:30.459
Also, spread his responsibilities to others.

49:50.001 --> 49:54.959
Dipshit, if you took out a loan,
have the decency to pay back!

49:54.959 --> 49:56.376
I'll pay back!

49:56.584 --> 50:00.459
Look at this punk ass, think you're all that?

50:03.126 --> 50:04.084
Afternoon.

50:06.167 --> 50:08.417
Don't you know this is my turf?

50:08.417 --> 50:09.542
Jong-ho sent us...

50:12.751 --> 50:15.042
Get the fuck out of my face.

50:28.417 --> 50:30.167
Do you really want me dead'?

50:37.001 --> 50:39.459
Your interest won't die with you.

50:40.792 --> 50:41.584
Hwan!

50:43.292 --> 50:49.292
I really hope that I won't see
your blood on my hands.

50:59.417 --> 51:02.001
This 250,000 ha sector includes...

51:02.001 --> 51:03.626
So how much?

51:03.959 --> 51:08.001
Of the $201.5 million,
$150 million will be privatized.

51:08.459 --> 51:10.417
Who are they negotiating with?

51:10.626 --> 51:14.626
HY and Jeil, but HY's the front runner.

51:14.792 --> 51:17.501
Isn't chairman Kang in charge of Jeil Marina?

51:17.501 --> 51:18.792
That's correct, sir.

51:19.751 --> 51:20.959
Give him a call.

51:20.959 --> 51:21.751
Right away.

51:22.751 --> 51:25.834
Chairman Kang, yeah, it's me.

51:26.376 --> 51:29.084
I hear you're working on something fun.

51:29.667 --> 51:32.167
What? It's no fun?

51:36.792 --> 51:40.584
Should I spice things up?

51:42.792 --> 51:43.959
Is it okay to be here during the day?

51:44.126 --> 51:45.292
Who cares.

51:46.542 --> 51:49.334
I polished a piece of shit into gold,

51:49.709 --> 51:52.417
but someone else'll reap the benefits,

51:52.917 --> 51:55.334
and I'm reduced to collecting debts
from the feeble.

51:55.834 --> 51:59.292
But that's how you got to where you are now.

52:02.626 --> 52:05.459
This'll make you feel better.

53:07.792 --> 53:11.251
There was only sky and sea here.

53:12.042 --> 53:14.209
Why's it so messy now?

53:14.209 --> 53:17.209
Even a mountain changes in a decade.

53:17.584 --> 53:20.167
Ocean will surely too.

53:48.709 --> 53:51.292
This is rather awkward.

54:02.001 --> 54:03.251
You have to leave, sir.

54:04.959 --> 54:06.959
Prepare two matching coffins.

54:07.542 --> 54:08.542
Lead him out of here!

54:19.459 --> 54:23.084
What's an abandoned rook doing
on the chessboard?!

54:23.667 --> 54:24.959
Take care of it!

54:28.084 --> 54:28.917
Let go!

54:32.792 --> 54:36.626
Perhaps you took your job too personally.

54:36.626 --> 54:38.876
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play dumb.

54:39.251 --> 54:43.209
I was grooming Hwan just fine.

54:44.126 --> 54:48.251
I will not allow him to falter because of you.

54:48.251 --> 54:49.792
He's not your fucking mutt!

55:00.917 --> 55:02.334
Cha Yun-su...

55:03.126 --> 55:04.751
Madame Cha, I mean.

55:08.834 --> 55:10.459
Can you handle it?

56:08.001 --> 56:10.501
Take the fucking knife!

56:14.709 --> 56:17.667
Did that whore take your fucking balls?

56:21.167 --> 56:23.001
Stand down, boy.

56:29.751 --> 56:31.501
You up for this?

56:35.292 --> 56:36.459
Motherfucker!

56:37.084 --> 56:39.834
It's all your own undoing.

56:40.584 --> 56:43.126
Don't you know what we're here to do?

56:49.501 --> 56:51.167
How could I not?

57:50.917 --> 57:51.959
Kill 'em all!

01:00:43.209 --> 01:00:45.001
You fucker...

01:01:48.459 --> 01:01:50.959
Try to stay awake.

01:01:51.084 --> 01:01:54.959
Boss, the cleaning is done.

01:01:55.334 --> 01:01:58.834
But Cutter isn't out of the picture.

01:02:03.501 --> 01:02:04.709
Yes, sir.

01:02:06.251 --> 01:02:07.542
You Okay?

01:03:39.084 --> 01:03:41.876
The call cannot be connected...

01:03:42.292 --> 01:03:45.751
Next up, Han Young-su, a former Red Whales,

01:03:45.751 --> 01:03:48.459
has committed suicide.

01:03:48.709 --> 01:03:53.334
His bereaved family stated
that he took his own life,

01:03:53.334 --> 01:03:55.834
when he was unable
to control his mounting debt.

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:23.626
CEO Jung Sang-ha

01:05:24.751 --> 01:05:27.292
Where is the end of this road?

01:05:27.834 --> 01:05:33.626
How will I look when I finally reach it?

01:05:46.501 --> 01:05:48.626
Here for Madame Cha?

01:05:59.542 --> 01:06:01.251
Do you know where she is?

01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:08.417
She's famous for ripping men off.

01:06:09.959 --> 01:06:13.126
She probably got to several others too.

01:06:22.834 --> 01:06:23.834
Tonight...

01:06:26.084 --> 01:06:28.126
could be the end for Jong-ho.

01:06:32.084 --> 01:06:33.376
Did you...

01:06:35.876 --> 01:06:37.834
Plan it?

01:06:42.167 --> 01:06:44.001
Is that what you think too?

01:06:48.084 --> 01:06:50.792
Don't fuck around, say it straight!

01:06:50.876 --> 01:06:52.626
I saw you...

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:54.667
stab him.

01:06:55.209 --> 01:06:56.584
Is that what you want to believe?

01:06:57.542 --> 01:06:58.126
Say it again.

01:07:05.376 --> 01:07:08.584
Go on, slice me.

01:07:13.167 --> 01:07:14.251
Slice me open.

01:07:14.292 --> 01:07:16.084
Goddamn fuck!

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:31.626
Getting stabbed is on par for our line of work.

01:07:33.376 --> 01:07:39.959
But I won't tolerate my own
turning his back on me.

01:07:49.751 --> 01:07:51.667
Stop yapping and go home.

01:07:52.917 --> 01:07:54.501
We got work cut out for us.

01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:10.084
Off you go.

01:08:23.792 --> 01:08:25.417
Sang-ha, my boy.

01:08:54.334 --> 01:08:57.167
Hwan! Boss is in trouble!

01:08:57.167 --> 01:08:59.876
I can't reach Tae-mu.

01:08:59.876 --> 01:09:02.292
Remember where we first met?

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:08.084
Looks like Sang-ha raised a fine minion.

01:10:14.042 --> 01:10:15.417
You're Cutter?

01:10:17.751 --> 01:10:19.084
So disrespectful...

01:10:27.751 --> 01:10:32.126
Son, kids who don't respect elders

01:10:32.542 --> 01:10:35.042
don't live long.

01:10:36.084 --> 01:10:38.209
Then come earn my respect.

01:11:32.167 --> 01:11:34.959
You should've stayed down.

01:13:07.292 --> 01:13:09.042
What will you do?

01:13:12.459 --> 01:13:14.251
If I go to hell,

01:13:16.042 --> 01:13:20.459
I'll bribe Lucifer and go to heaven.

01:14:00.542 --> 01:14:05.501
Life's full of ironies.

01:14:11.417 --> 01:14:14.626
Isn't it funny?

01:14:15.126 --> 01:14:19.542
Sang-ha burned you,

01:14:19.917 --> 01:14:25.584
but you unknowingly worship him.

01:14:29.959 --> 01:14:34.917
He's the one who fucked your life.

01:14:36.501 --> 01:14:45.126
You were caught in the trap he laid out for me.

01:14:50.459 --> 01:14:53.751
You pitiful bastard...

01:15:19.626 --> 01:15:21.626
Continue working for us.

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:29.126
But up close, it's a chaotic slaughterhouse.

01:15:39.917 --> 01:15:45.001
But I won't tolerate my own
turning his back on me.

01:15:48.209 --> 01:15:50.751
Please join me in welcoming

01:15:50.834 --> 01:15:54.042
the new CEO of Jeil Marina,

01:15:54.042 --> 01:15:58.417
who'll lead our ocean industry
to the international stage.

01:16:16.167 --> 01:16:20.792
I sincerely thank you all
for attending this grand occasion.

01:16:32.751 --> 01:16:37.542
No calling, no moving, no talking!

01:19:02.251 --> 01:19:05.459
"If you desire money, chase the scent."

01:19:05.792 --> 01:19:07.834
That's what you said to me.

01:19:10.334 --> 01:19:14.959
You can't even differentiate money
from blood now?

01:19:19.042 --> 01:19:20.292
I'm up for it, sir.

01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:24.542
Go on now.

01:19:42.584 --> 01:19:45.209
There're already cruise boats on Han River,

01:19:45.501 --> 01:19:48.376
a few more yachts isn't a big fuss.

01:19:49.667 --> 01:19:51.917
I'm dreaming even bigger things.

01:19:54.376 --> 01:19:55.917
Looks like...

01:19:58.209 --> 01:20:00.584
you don't dream very big.

01:20:00.751 --> 01:20:03.876
It must look petty to politicians.

01:20:06.626 --> 01:20:10.376
What do money and power have in common?

01:20:11.917 --> 01:20:14.917
The one who's holding it is the master.

01:20:17.417 --> 01:20:22.167
You should become the master
of your own domain.

01:20:33.417 --> 01:20:35.251
You said so yourself.

01:20:35.917 --> 01:20:39.334
"Once you let go of sympathy,
you gain respect."

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:43.417
So why did you pity me?

01:20:47.001 --> 01:20:49.751
You must be gravely mistaken.

01:20:51.584 --> 01:20:56.084
I...never pitied you.

01:21:08.334 --> 01:21:10.001
I don't...

01:21:11.084 --> 01:21:16.126
even know what sympathy is.

01:21:16.501 --> 01:21:18.126
From here on,

01:21:18.417 --> 01:21:20.459
I'll only feed on

01:21:22.209 --> 01:21:23.959
respect.

01:21:24.792 --> 01:21:25.792
Hwan.

01:21:27.459 --> 01:21:29.501
Should you be like this?

01:21:32.584 --> 01:21:34.209
- Be well.
- They're not...

01:21:36.042 --> 01:21:38.251
people we can handle.

01:22:51.334 --> 01:22:52.959
A rook...

01:22:53.292 --> 01:22:55.959
leapt out of the chessboard.

01:22:57.959 --> 01:23:00.501
Come, sit down.

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:37.917
We got an extraordinary relationship.

01:23:51.584 --> 01:23:55.042
Endless greed...

01:24:04.167 --> 01:24:09.751
You tasted money too well.

01:24:11.792 --> 01:24:13.501
Your head must be rotten to hell.

01:24:15.542 --> 01:24:17.167
Cut him slowly,

01:24:18.376 --> 01:24:20.084
let him feel it.

01:25:11.376 --> 01:25:14.626
I need some popcorn.

01:25:16.459 --> 01:25:19.084
So many plot twists.

01:25:45.209 --> 01:25:46.126
Look over here please!

01:25:47.084 --> 01:25:49.751
Did you contribute
to the ruling party's campaign?

01:25:56.584 --> 01:25:59.459
I had the ledger in front of me.

01:26:00.042 --> 01:26:00.917
Where is it?

01:26:01.251 --> 01:26:05.334
I'm dying to know that myself too.

01:26:05.876 --> 01:26:09.292
Where could it be?

01:26:10.542 --> 01:26:14.126
In any case, that's the situation we're in.

01:26:14.334 --> 01:26:18.292
Take a good rest while at it.

01:26:18.792 --> 01:26:21.334
Make sure to find out what happened.

01:26:22.167 --> 01:26:26.251
Also, release Sang-ha back out.

01:26:28.667 --> 01:26:34.542
This isn't a soccer game,
you don't sub one for another.

01:26:58.917 --> 01:27:02.167
I'll setup another game.

01:27:02.751 --> 01:27:05.542
You just reset the board.

01:27:07.959 --> 01:27:13.209
You're the only king I recognize
on the chessboard.

01:27:15.376 --> 01:27:22.251
But I'm the one
who controls the board, even rook.

01:27:24.501 --> 01:27:26.126
Don't forget it.

01:27:59.584 --> 01:28:04.042
Boss, did you see the old man on TV yesterday?

01:28:04.376 --> 01:28:08.251
He looked so frail and pathetic!

01:28:09.542 --> 01:28:11.542
How did you work your magic?

01:28:18.917 --> 01:28:23.001
Boss, everything's calm now,

01:28:23.626 --> 01:28:25.834
why don't you bring her back?

01:28:26.126 --> 01:28:27.292
Kyung-su,

01:28:28.626 --> 01:28:36.542
I realized that she never
once came to me first.

01:28:38.167 --> 01:28:42.584
I finally understand why.

01:28:50.376 --> 01:28:52.209
Let's hear the weather forecast.

01:28:52.626 --> 01:28:53.626
Yes, boss.

01:29:29.292 --> 01:29:31.917
"CEO Lee Hwan"

01:29:36.959 --> 01:29:39.459
Why go to such lengths for him?

01:29:39.792 --> 01:29:44.584
Watching him eat with his bare hands...

01:29:44.584 --> 01:29:46.084
was like...

01:29:49.834 --> 01:29:51.459
seeing myself.

01:29:55.501 --> 01:30:00.417
Cutter and I followed the old man blindly.

01:30:03.292 --> 01:30:08.792
But Hwan is sitting at his dinner table.

01:30:10.292 --> 01:30:13.376
So as a parting gift,

01:30:17.834 --> 01:30:20.501
I'll give him a spoon.

01:31:47.834 --> 01:31:51.292
Take everyone out.

01:31:54.084 --> 01:31:57.084
These are the statement and contract,

01:31:57.834 --> 01:31:59.042
everything's here.

01:32:03.376 --> 01:32:04.459
Shall we?

01:32:21.167 --> 01:32:24.042
Could I get a smoke?

01:32:35.042 --> 01:32:37.792
I said a goddamn smoke!

01:34:16.209 --> 01:34:19.376
This is all you got? Get ready.

01:37:07.667 --> 01:37:11.959
Hwan, you got a smoke?

01:37:59.709 --> 01:38:01.834
You didn't have to do this.

01:38:12.334 --> 01:38:13.334
Let go!

01:38:14.792 --> 01:38:16.292
Rat fucker...

01:38:17.376 --> 01:38:19.334
Send him to his mom.

01:38:26.792 --> 01:38:27.792
Boy.

01:38:28.834 --> 01:38:29.876
Motherfucker!

01:38:30.251 --> 01:38:31.251
Come here, you little shit!

01:38:49.959 --> 01:38:51.626
"Lee Hwan"

01:38:56.376 --> 01:39:00.417
How did we end up like this?

01:39:08.251 --> 01:39:10.667
There's a storm brewing.

01:39:11.834 --> 01:39:13.334
Let's go inside...

01:39:40.834 --> 01:39:42.834
Could I have stopped it?

01:39:45.459 --> 01:39:47.459
When should I have stopped?

01:39:52.167 --> 01:39:54.167
The clouds in the sky...

01:39:56.834 --> 01:39:58.834
feel too close...
