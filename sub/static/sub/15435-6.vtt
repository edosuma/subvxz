00:02.160 --> 00:05.230
your sister took a pregnancy test,
but it was negative.

00:05.290 --> 00:08.109
Actually,it was,um,positive.

00:08.170 --> 00:10.070
-what? 
-what?

00:10.130 --> 00:13.870
Whatever extracurricular 
relationship you have,end it.

00:13.930 --> 00:18.950
I award joseph whedon full temporary 
custody of paige and cooper whedon.

00:19.040 --> 00:22.720
I have a lot of friends who are addicts,
and when they head back down this road

00:22.800 --> 00:24.500
--starting now,everything changes.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.460
It was a big gay cocktail party.

00:26.540 --> 00:28.440
So it was all gay 
men and uncle saul?

00:28.520 --> 00:30.590
Why do I feel like I'm 
being cross-examined?

00:30.670 --> 00:33.510
All I said was,
"you never told me your uncle's gay.

00:33.670 --> 00:35.040
Are you happy...

00:35.100 --> 00:36.250
about the baby?

00:36.310 --> 00:38.980
Yeah,I'm really,really happy.

00:46.530 --> 00:48.280
I,um...

00:48.610 --> 00:50.290
I gotta get going.

00:50.660 --> 00:53.960
You know,there's nothing that 
says you can't spend the night.

00:53.960 --> 00:56.960
I'll even make you my famous 
french toast in the morning,

00:57.040 --> 01:01.060
which,in the spirit of full disclosure,
I get from the diner across the street.

01:05.280 --> 01:08.820
sounds great,but,um...I gotta go.

Hi,mom.

Hey,chicken!

01:40.110 --> 01:43.450
So it looks likee're up to...

01:43.550 --> 01:46.090
ooh,"the whomping willow.

01:46.170 --> 01:48.050
I don't really feel like it.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.760
Oh,honey,do you feel okay?

01:50.820 --> 01:52.800
I'm just tired,that's all.

01:52.860 --> 01:54.230
Okay.

01:54.300 --> 01:59.910
Well,you go get some sleep and know 
that I love you more than anything.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.170
Good night.

02:01.230 --> 02:03.430
Good night,beautiful girl.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.070
you're not still at the office,are you?

02:11.130 --> 02:13.700
Uh,no,I-I called it a night.

02:13.770 --> 02:14.780
How are you feeling?

02:14.840 --> 02:15.900
Uh,great.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.520
Really great,except,you 
know,I'm exhausted,

02:18.600 --> 02:21.700
and I'm constantly 
fighting the urge to vomit.

02:21.760 --> 02:23.690
I wish I could be there.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.860
I would hold your hair 
back while you puke.

02:25.920 --> 02:27.960
You know what?
You're so romantic.

02:28.250 --> 02:29.360
I try.

02:29.420 --> 02:32.830
By the way,um,operation puppy 
is proceeding as planned.

02:32.910 --> 02:34.700
Must we call it "operation puppy"?

02:34.780 --> 02:39.120
Well,"operation shotgun wedding 
because the condom broke just 
doesn't have the same ring.

02:39.180 --> 02:42.520
But I did find some really good 
help for the event

02:42.590 --> 02:44.810
--cheap,efficient...

02:44.910 --> 02:46.200
mom.

02:46.260 --> 02:48.620
I might have known.look

02:48.640 --> 02:50.510
how is the media strategy coming?

02:50.590 --> 02:53.170
Oh,well,you
--you know,I'm on top of it.

02:53.250 --> 02:55.260
Are you being purposefully evasive?

02:55.260 --> 02:57.180
No,I'm just not bombarding you with the details

02:57.220 --> 03:00.060
because you and I agreed that we 
would divide and conquer.

03:00.120 --> 03:04.260
You'd run for president,
and I would take control of the domtic situation.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.640
Unless,of course,you
--you want to switch.

03:06.700 --> 03:07.880
I do.

03:07.940 --> 03:10.330
I'm tired of sleeping at 30,000 feet.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.570
No,sorry,not you.

03:15.650 --> 03:16.860
Honey,I gotta go.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.420
I love you. -I love you,too.

03:19.880 --> 03:22.750
Isaac! -Hey,kitty!

03:22.870 --> 03:24.590
isaac,hi!

03:24.670 --> 03:26.290
Oh,hello. -Oh,kitty.

03:27.090 --> 03:31.670
Oh,it's so good to see you.
Look at you.It's been a long time.

03:31.770 --> 03:34.420
So you're finally collecting,huh?

03:34.510 --> 03:36.380
Oh,well,you know,I told you I would.

03:36.460 --> 03:38.110
Stupid move on my part--

03:38.170 --> 03:41.440
I get you to keep quiet about my 
candidate's offshore accounts,

03:41.500 --> 03:43.940
and the idiot still loses the election.

03:43.940 --> 03:46.510
Hmm,well,too bad,my friend.
A deal's a deal.

03:46.570 --> 03:49.750
Well,I just wish you didn't wait until I retired.

03:49.750 --> 03:53.420
Well,I couldn't waste your talents 
on something trivial.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.690
Uh,so,um,have a seat.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.320
I'm all ears.

04:06.970 --> 04:09.350
well,this is sort of
-- it's sort of--sort of--

04:09.420 --> 04:11.890
I-it--it's--it is-- well,it's kind of stupid.

04:11.930 --> 04:14.080
Just--I'M...

04:14.220 --> 04:15.440
I'M...

04:15.500 --> 04:17.510
I'm pregnant.

04:21.820 --> 04:25.420
oh,w-with that buildup,
I thought your guy was busted

04:25.480 --> 04:29.810
playing footsies with a state trooper in 
an airport bathroom.

04:30.730 --> 04:33.200
no,no,thank-- thank goodness,no.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.830
But,uh,so
--so,then this is nothing to worry about?

04:36.890 --> 04:39.670
It's not a felony,
but of course it's something to worry about.

04:39.730 --> 04:44.090
The girlfriend of a presidential 
candate gets pregnant?

04:44.190 --> 04:46.280
Pretty scandalous in some 
parts of the country.

04:46.340 --> 04:48.580
Right.Right,of course.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.240
Well,we--we've already been on it.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.460
We--we've moved the wedding 
up a month.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.580
You do need me,yeah.

04:55.660 --> 04:57.410
If your boy wants to be president,

04:57.470 --> 05:01.600
you get your butts down to city hall
--no muss,no fuss.

05:01.660 --> 05:02.770
Really?

05:02.830 --> 05:03.720
W-when?

05:03.800 --> 05:04.940
This weekend.

05:05.020 --> 05:08.190
No!No,no.You're telling me that I 
have to get married in two days?

05:08.250 --> 05:10.080
No time to waste.

05:20.420 --> 05:21.700
Kevin.

05:21.780 --> 05:22.810
W-why are you here?

05:22.850 --> 05:25.330
Uh,well,I called your cell phone,
but it's disconnected.

05:25.390 --> 05:27.430
So I dropped by your place,
and your landlady--

05:27.490 --> 05:30.950
who is really creepy,by the way
-- said you no longer live there.

05:31.010 --> 05:32.660
Yeah,well,I would love to catch up,

05:32.740 --> 05:36.490
but I just spent the last hour deboning 
quail,and now I'm moving on to chicken.

05:36.550 --> 05:38.860
So now is not the best time.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.860
Okay,fine,I get it,you're mad 
about the whole saul thing.

05:42.940 --> 05:46.730
But,you know,
disconnecting your phone and 
moving is a little extreme,even for you.

05:46.790 --> 05:50.690
This may come as a shock to you,
but what's happening with me has 
nothing to do with you.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.400
Okay,fine.What...

05:52.460 --> 05:53.840
does it have to do with?

05:53.900 --> 05:55.580
I'd really...

05:55.780 --> 05:57.790
rather not do this here.

05:57.850 --> 06:02.130
I would rather not stalk my friends 
for them to talk to me,
but I'm here.

06:05.530 --> 06:08.120
My tuition was due,
so I fell behind on my rent

06:08.180 --> 06:11.300
and my car insurance and my phone bill.

06:11.380 --> 06:15.440
Turns out being a cooking student 
and apprentice sous chef isn't a 
road to financial freedom.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.060
Why didn't you just call me?

06:17.120 --> 06:19.630
Oh,what is it they say-- "pride goeth 
before the eviction"?

06:19.690 --> 06:21.300
Oh,come on,scotty,this is me.

06:21.360 --> 06:26.550
I know,and you were finally starting to treat me 
like someone whose life wasn't a complete train wreck.

06:26.590 --> 06:28.150
So where are you staying?

06:28.220 --> 06:31.870
Oh,friends' futons,friends' sleeping bags

06:31.930 --> 06:33.850
and last night,my ranchero.

06:33.910 --> 06:34.850
You're homeless?

06:34.930 --> 06:37.130
Oh,I like to think of it as 
being between homes.

06:38.010 --> 06:40.020
Oh,look,I have...

06:40.270 --> 06:43.760
I've got an inflatable mattress.
You should come stay with me.

06:44.500 --> 06:47.800
Are you really sure there's room for me 
with all our baggage?

06:47.860 --> 06:51.560
I have a boyfriend,
and I'm in love,so...

06:52.140 --> 06:54.690
and your missionary really won't mind?

06:54.750 --> 06:57.490
If he's gonna be looking after 
poor school children,

06:57.570 --> 07:00.920
the least I can do is shelter a 
struggling culinary artist.

07:02.550 --> 07:04.050
Okay.

07:04.610 --> 07:08.840
I'll,um,I'll put the key under the mat.

07:12.790 --> 07:15.000
-Good luck with the chicken. 
-Thank you.

07:25.090 --> 07:26.680
every single one,you know?

07:26.740 --> 07:28.270
I was looking--
I was looking at this new trend

07:28.330 --> 07:30.410
-- I don't like new tre
-- good morning,justin.

07:30.470 --> 07:31.940
Hey.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.530
Are you okay?

07:33.670 --> 07:35.640
Just didn't get a lot of sleep.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.560
Thank god for skinemax.

07:37.620 --> 07:38.760
Oh,that's nice.

07:38.840 --> 07:43.220
Okay,well,anyways,
the new centerpiece trend is to 
put citrus fruit in the vases instead of flowers.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.090
Citrus fruit?No,no,no,no.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.580
We couldn't do citrus fruit.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.160
It would look like we were 
advertising for ojai foods,

07:49.240 --> 07:52.490
and besides that, kitty is much more 
of a traditionalist than that.

07:52.530 --> 07:54.510
Except for the fact that she got 
knocked up before the I dos.

07:54.570 --> 07:56.710
Yes,well,except for that.

07:57.770 --> 08:01.300
I was thinking hydngeas,white orchidS.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.600
What do you think,justin?

08:02.660 --> 08:04.700
I think now is my cue to leave.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.060
Eo que ahora es I love orchids.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.800
Yes.I love orchids,too.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.760
I--I'll just run that by kitty.

08:16.380 --> 08:18.550
He seems a bit down,doesn't he?

08:18.610 --> 08:22.950
Well,his life pretty much consists of physical therapy 
and more physical therapy,so,you know--

08:23.010 --> 08:25.520
he really needs to have some fun.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.700
You don't happen to have any single,
attractive friends,do you?

08:30.400 --> 08:31.350
hello?

08:31.430 --> 08:32.860
Kitty,I was just gonna call you.

08:32.919 --> 08:35.740
Okay,hydrangeas,white orchids...

08:36.799 --> 08:38.080
what change of plans?

08:38.179 --> 08:41.789
But we lose an opportunity for media coverage.

08:41.850 --> 08:44.049
Everybody loves weddings.

08:44.110 --> 08:45.490
Uh,I'm sorry.

08:45.560 --> 08:47.410
What's your name again?

08:48.020 --> 08:50.330
Uh,travis.

08:50.390 --> 08:54.050
Uh,travis,people like celebrity weddings.

08:54.110 --> 08:55.770
Political weddings--

08:55.810 --> 09:00.320
the last one that meant anything was charles 
and diana, and look how well that turned out.

09:00.380 --> 09:02.280
Yeah,I-I agree with isaac.

09:02.390 --> 09:06.260
We--we get married under the radar,
and then we send a press release to the media saying

09:06.330 --> 09:10.810
that our impending wedding is distracting 
them from the current issues and the campaign.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.900
And what about the bun in the oven?

09:12.960 --> 09:16.570
Well,we wait till the second trimester to 
announce kitty's pregnant.

09:16.610 --> 09:17.600
Come on!

09:17.640 --> 09:20.240
It is still gonna reek of a shotgun wedding.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.930
The christian right is gonna have a 
field day with this.

09:22.990 --> 09:25.830
I'm sorry to break it to you-- 
the christian right,

09:25.870 --> 09:28.060
they're not even supporting your candidate.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.380
So we abandon the base?

09:30.440 --> 09:33.110
No.You own the candidate you have.

09:33.150 --> 09:39.010
Make mccallister and kitty,um,represent a modern
-day jack and jackie.

09:39.050 --> 09:40.080
I'm sorry.

09:40.140 --> 09:42.690
That's a little pie-in-the-sky,don't you think?

09:42.750 --> 09:45.860
Not if we give the press something else to focus on.

09:45.930 --> 09:52.620
Right,right,something that makes our wedding 
and our baby look completely old-fashioned and quaint.

09:52.700 --> 09:54.200
Like...

09:54.270 --> 09:56.270
I'm working on it.

09:56.830 --> 09:59.620
Does robert know about any of this?

10:01.940 --> 10:04.280
Oh,I'm sorry to barge in.

10:04.360 --> 10:07.030
kitty,I cannot stand by and let this happen.

10:07.090 --> 10:08.890
For the love of pete!

10:08.950 --> 10:10.910
This is the most important day of your life.
You can't honor your--

10:10.960 --> 10:13.810
I am in the middle of a meeting.I'm not gonna talk about this.
 we are not going to negotiate this.

10:13.850 --> 10:17.080
-You're gonna thank me one day.
You are gonna thank me... 
-excuse me.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.570
I promise you,I am not ever gonna thank 
you for this.I will not.

10:20.570 --> 10:21.980
Who are you?

10:22.040 --> 10:24.520
I'm nora walker.

10:24.940 --> 10:26.670
she's my mother.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.880
you should've seen this child.4 years old,

10:32.950 --> 10:35.740
she put a dishcloth on her head,
pretending it was a veil,

10:35.820 --> 10:39.270
walked down the aisle as if to prince charming.

10:39.350 --> 10:40.590
That was kevin.

10:40.670 --> 10:42.030
It was both of you.

10:42.070 --> 10:45.230
Don't you remember how you would 
pore over my wedding pictures?

10:45.740 --> 10:49.490
She's your little girl,
and you want her wedding day to be perfect.

10:49.550 --> 10:50.470
Yes.

10:50.550 --> 10:51.880
I understand that. -Good.

10:51.940 --> 10:53.760
But this isn't about romance.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.260
It's politics. -Politics be damned.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.530
Mom,the groom is running for president.

10:58.610 --> 11:01.800
And given that,
this wedding needs to be disposed of.

11:01.850 --> 11:03.920
Oh,isn't that nice?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.890
What a lovely way for them to 
start their lives together.

11:06.950 --> 11:08.510
Well,what do you suggest,mrs.Walker?

11:08.590 --> 11:10.310
It's ms.Walker,

11:10.370 --> 11:14.550
and who said a wedding can't be 
memorable,romantic and quick?

11:14.570 --> 11:17.120
Kitty,we could use our house.

11:17.180 --> 11:19.400
You could wear my dress,
flowers from the yard-- 

11:19.460 --> 11:21.330
mom,thank you.You're being very sweet,

11:21.380 --> 11:22.670
but--but--
but you know how you are.

11:22.710 --> 11:24.130
You'll get carried away,
and the minute you tell kevin...

11:24.190 --> 11:25.060
I won'T. -Everybody in the world will know.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.470
You really want to take this on?

11:26.550 --> 11:27.880
Yes.

11:28.510 --> 11:33.410
Look,robert and kitty deserve more 
than drop ceilings and fluorescent lights.

11:33.470 --> 11:35.340
Fluorescent lights,kitty.

11:35.380 --> 11:40.820
Ms.Walker,if you can pull this off by 
sunday morning,I put it in your hands.

11:41.620 --> 11:43.970
You put it in my hands.Thank you.

11:44.030 --> 11:45.870
He put it in my hands. -Yes,he did.

11:45.910 --> 11:47.440
Fine.

11:50.930 --> 11:52.760
Call me nora.

11:52.820 --> 11:54.900
In my hands.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.250
wow,what was that about?

11:59.340 --> 12:02.120
You just--you just folded like an origami swan.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.270
You know me.

12:03.330 --> 12:05.150
I don't fight battles I can't win.

12:05.740 --> 12:07.180
Two days?

12:07.220 --> 12:10.010
I know,I know,
but I do not want to hear it's impossible,

12:10.070 --> 12:13.490
because I just convinced some republican 
politico that it is ssible.

12:13.570 --> 12:15.800
All I want to hear is that you'll be 
here tomorrow to help.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.700
Mom,I've got the kids this wkend.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.180
Great!Four more hands.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.920
Oh,god. -sarah,principal briel is on line two.

12:21.980 --> 12:24.170
Uh,mom,I've got paige's school on the other line.

12:24.230 --> 12:26.130
Call me back!Call me back!

12:26.190 --> 12:28.650
sarah walker speaking.

12:30.170 --> 12:32.140
I'll be right there.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.410
I'll take a tuna sandwich

12:33.470 --> 12:34.910
-- oh,no,tuna?Tuna,no,no.

12:34.970 --> 12:36.120
No fish.

12:36.570 --> 12:40.550
Let's make that a veggie salad,uh,with chicken.

12:40.630 --> 12:42.460
Thank you.

12:43.490 --> 12:45.000
hi,honey.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.890
Um,what--what are you doing back so soon?

12:47.970 --> 12:50.380
The rally was canceled.It was raining.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.480
What's he doing here?

12:52.610 --> 12:54.180
Hey,robert.

12:54.250 --> 12:55.810
it's good to see you again.

12:55.850 --> 12:58.310
I think double congratulations are in order.

12:58.610 --> 12:59.620
Thank you.

12:59.700 --> 13:03.120
Would you mind if I just took one second to 
catch up with kitty?

13:03.180 --> 13:04.320
Of course.

13:04.380 --> 13:05.950
Take your time.

13:06.260 --> 13:09.360
That is who the hell you think you need to 
get this under control?

13:09.420 --> 13:11.060
Why didn't you just hire G.Gordon liddy?

13:11.120 --> 13:13.670
Oh,please.Would you stop being so dramatic?

13:13.730 --> 13:15.910
He is the best at--at damage control.

13:15.970 --> 13:17.570
He is damage.

13:17.650 --> 13:21.260
Look,if people get wind that he is on this 
campaign,they will think we are in crisis.

13:21.320 --> 13:22.740
Oh,well,guess what,robert?

13:22.820 --> 13:25.210
We are in a crisis.
Remember,I'm pregnant?

13:25.250 --> 13:28.000
Isaac is handling this as a favor 
to me,and after that,

13:28.060 --> 13:30.490
he is going to be gone,and you are never 
gonna have to deal with him again.

13:30.570 --> 13:33.530
But if you want to get through this pregnancy,
and you want to get through this wedding,

13:33.620 --> 13:35.980
and you still want to be a viable republican 
presidential candidate,

13:36.040 --> 13:40.780
then you are gonna have to get ahold of 
your testosterone,and you are gonna have to suck it up!

13:41.890 --> 13:46.070
So sarah and I are being civil,
which is an improvement from her just glaring at me,

13:46.100 --> 13:49.040
and justin's doing great.He's off his crutches,

13:49.100 --> 13:52.190
and I mean,the physical therapy's still hurting 
him,but he's handling it,so...

13:52.270 --> 13:54.030
that's great.

13:54.170 --> 13:55.090
Here.

13:55.170 --> 13:57.140
Yeah,and I've been,um,reading about 
vets coming home,and,you know,

13:57.200 --> 13:58.660
I'm just trying to give him his space-- 

13:58.720 --> 14:01.410
rebecca,you have been home for an hour,

14:01.470 --> 14:03.490
and all you've done is talk about the walkers.

14:03.570 --> 14:05.720
Mom,I know you're still mad at them,but-- 

14:05.760 --> 14:08.480
this is not about them at all.This is about you.

14:08.540 --> 14:09.700
I'm doing great.

14:09.740 --> 14:14.410
No,what you're doing is being nursemaid to 
justin and assistant to nora.

14:14.490 --> 14:15.920
that's not fair.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.930
You know,
I have come to terms with the fact
 that you need to know them and be part of their lives.

14:22.010 --> 14:24.510
I miss you,but I understand.

14:24.570 --> 14:27.960
But,sweetie,you shouldn't give up 
yourself in the process.

14:28.020 --> 14:29.320
What are you talking about?

14:29.400 --> 14:32.510
I'm talking about your life,you.

14:32.570 --> 14:33.830
I have a life.

14:33.910 --> 14:35.530
It's not like I'm wasting my time.

14:35.610 --> 14:37.480
And you may not understand this,
mom,but he needs me.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.790
He depends on me for a lot of things,
and I just want to help him get through this.

14:40.830 --> 14:45.280
When I was your age,
I thought that I had all the time in the world.

14:45.360 --> 14:50.420
But the truth is you don't,
and I don't want you to look back 
at this time and have regrets.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.950
Okay,I won'T.

14:52.010 --> 14:53.860
Can we drop this?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.410
For now.

15:03.910 --> 15:06.100
I'm meeting with a former associate of mine.

15:06.180 --> 15:07.770
He might be of some help.

15:08.230 --> 15:10.720
Look,kitty's an old friend.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.890
There's not much I wouldn't do for her.

15:13.940 --> 15:15.940
I don't like how you operate.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.210
And kitty's brought you on-- that's fine.

15:18.270 --> 15:19.640
I'll give her that latitude.

15:19.700 --> 15:22.080
But let me make one thing really clear,

15:22.140 --> 15:25.450
around here,I run a clean shop.

15:25.740 --> 15:28.120
You can't stand me,can you?

15:28.180 --> 15:30.180
That's putting it mildly.

15:42.290 --> 15:44.210
no,no.No,guys.No.

15:44.270 --> 15:46.220
No,no,this table stays here.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.290
I'm gonna put the place 
cards on the tables outside.

15:48.370 --> 15:51.260
Mom,it's all family.
Do we really need assigned seating?

15:51.320 --> 15:53.210
Yeah,please,nora.
And don't sit me next to kevin.

15:53.290 --> 15:55.490
The details matter.

15:55.570 --> 15:57.120
This couch I want you to move out.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.460
I'm sorry,I'm too old for that,nora.

15:59.520 --> 16:04.400
Oh,saul,come on.Think of your darling 
niece upstairs resting,exhausted,nauseous

16:04.480 --> 16:05.830
--and here.

16:05.890 --> 16:07.820
Hi,honey,how are you feeling?

16:07.900 --> 16:10.330
Well,apparently,really bad.

16:10.410 --> 16:13.120
I was just saying to them that 
they should be at least--

16:13.200 --> 16:15.400
no,no,you were just guilting 
them into heavy lifting.

16:15.460 --> 16:16.970
I was not. -yeah,you were.

16:17.050 --> 16:18.940
Saul,uh,you want to go grab a beer?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.880
Is that what movers drink?

16:25.650 --> 16:27.210
the doctor's office called.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.900
You're all set up for your after-hours sonogram.

16:30.710 --> 16:32.050
Is robert going th you?

16:32.130 --> 16:33.840
uh,no,no.

16:33.950 --> 16:35.560
He's,uh,he's busy.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.150
Well,then I'll go with you.

16:37.210 --> 16:38.460
No,that's okay,you know?It's--

16:38.520 --> 16:40.370
it's just a routine.It's no big deal.

16:40.430 --> 16:43.170
Sweetheart,this is your first baby 
and your first sonogram.

16:43.230 --> 16:44.920
You can't do it alone.

16:44.980 --> 16:46.310
Do you really want to go?

16:46.370 --> 16:47.860
I really want to go.

16:48.710 --> 16:50.650
-Hi,grandma.Hi,aunt kitty. 
-Hey,paige.

16:50.730 --> 16:51.420
How are ya?

16:51.490 --> 16:52.720
Where's your mom and coop?

16:52.800 --> 16:54.420
In the kitchen.

17:00.910 --> 17:02.430
How's the boss?

17:02.470 --> 17:05.579
Bossy.Kevin's on a flower run,
and we're on furniture duty.

17:05.660 --> 17:07.460
Oh,god. -Oh,no,no,not me.I quit.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.150
Hey,kitty.

17:09.190 --> 17:11.310
Quick.Show aunt kitty what you made.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.690
What is it?

17:12.750 --> 17:15.940
It's something to hold your 
flowers in for your wedding.

17:16.020 --> 17:17.609
Oh,cooper,I love it.

17:17.690 --> 17:19.819
That is so cool.Thank you.

17:19.910 --> 17:21.849
What's with paige?Is she sick?

17:21.910 --> 17:23.910
No,she's grounded.

17:23.970 --> 17:27.150
well,she pulled the fire alarm...
at school for a dare.

17:28.800 --> 17:29.990
Well,that's not like her.

17:30.030 --> 17:33.220
I know.She's been very distant and angry.

17:33.490 --> 17:38.380
I think this new custody 
arrangement is really affecting her.

17:39.240 --> 17:40.660
Hey,how'd the interview go?

17:40.700 --> 17:41.730
Great.

17:41.770 --> 17:42.730
You were right.

17:42.790 --> 17:44.330
They asked about noid contracts.

17:44.370 --> 17:45.570
You still mad at me?

17:45.650 --> 17:49.740
He's a scum,
but it's hard to be mad at you 
when we're having a puppy.

17:50.040 --> 17:51.710
listen,I wish I could be there tonight.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.810
Ah,well,don't worry.
They-- they put it all on a dvd now.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.570
You can see it when you get home tonight.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.530
I can't wait.

17:57.620 --> 17:59.320
I know.I know.It's weird.

17:59.380 --> 18:01.910
It's messing everything up,
but it just feels right.

18:02.660 --> 18:06.290
Well,listen,it's gonna be late,
so don't wait up,okay?

18:06.380 --> 18:07.380
I love you.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.620
I love you,too.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.180
Bye.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.200
I remember that.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.110
I used to watch it all the time.

18:27.050 --> 18:29.020
So weird.

18:31.460 --> 18:33.730
So I hear you're grounded.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.470
You know,I got grounded once.

18:36.530 --> 18:38.500
Well,I got grounded a lot more than once,

18:38.560 --> 18:44.440
but there was this one time I got 
so mad at this boy that I forked his yard.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.000
What's that?

18:46.410 --> 18:52.050
do you know those,uh,those 
plastic forks that you get out of the cafeteria?

18:52.130 --> 18:56.430
Well,I used them to spell a 
message in front of his house.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.010
What did it say?

18:59.110 --> 19:00.970
mm,it was...

19:01.030 --> 19:03.050
it was very naughty.

19:04.380 --> 19:07.630
oh,do me a favor.
Don't tell your mother I told you about forking.

19:07.710 --> 19:10.910
Oh,and I also wanted to 
ask you another favor.

19:11.010 --> 19:18.420
Um,I need a flower girl for my wedding,
and I was really hoping that you would say yes.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.390
You want me to be your flower girl?

19:21.680 --> 19:23.290
Yeah,I do.

19:23.350 --> 19:26.060
So what do you say?
You up to it?

19:26.120 --> 19:28.770
Thanks,I'd love to. 
-Really?Oh,good.

19:28.830 --> 19:32.590
I'm so happy.
You're gonna be the best flower girl ever.

19:32.650 --> 19:33.680
thanks.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.690
What color--what color dress 
do you want to wear?

19:35.740 --> 19:37.030
-Purple. -Purple?

19:37.090 --> 19:38.920
Lena,hey,it's rebecca.

19:39.790 --> 19:43.670
Hey,yeah,I was wondering,
do you maybe want to grab a drink later?

19:43.710 --> 19:46.110
Oh,good,because it's total chaos over here.

19:46.170 --> 19:47.700
I need something to look forward to.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.070
Yeah,you and me both.

19:50.110 --> 19:51.690
I'll call you in a little bit.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.520
So,uh,where you goin'?

19:53.600 --> 19:56.040
Oh,I'm just gonna meet up with lena in a little bit.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.790
All of this weddg prep is-- 

19:57.830 --> 20:00.530
yeah,I know.
It's like an air traffic control in here.

20:03.650 --> 20:05.380
could I come?

20:09.340 --> 20:11.510
I mean,well,it's at a bar,so-- 

20:11.570 --> 20:16.130
oh,are you kidding?With this family,
I think I've mastered the skill of not drinking around drinkers.

20:16.430 --> 20:18.440
Well,then yeah.I mean,sure.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.300
It could be fun. -Cool.

20:21.370 --> 20:24.900
Uh,I postponed your speech to the 
pittsburgh fire workers union for the wedding.

20:24.920 --> 20:30.010
I've rescheduled it for wednesday 
between the pep rally in cincinnati 
and your cnn interview in new york.

20:30.070 --> 20:35.000
On sunday you get hitched,and then 
we jet to sacramento for the speech 
to the V.F.W.At 6:00.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.040
Did you schedule my bachelor party?

20:37.140 --> 20:38.530
Did you expect me to do that?

20:38.590 --> 20:41.230
No,travis,I didn't expect you
--come in.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.350
Am--am I interrupting?

20:44.410 --> 20:45.790
No.

20:45.850 --> 20:48.300
No,we were just finishing up.

20:48.420 --> 20:50.360
you can just put that on my desk.

21:00.790 --> 21:05.430
Did you know that governor adamson 
has a severely developmentally disabled son?

21:05.490 --> 21:07.330
No,I thought he just had the 
three daughters.

21:07.390 --> 21:10.710
His son has been in a residential 
facility since birth--

21:10.770 --> 21:17.600
a very reputable,very good,very expensive facility,
which he's paying for privately.

21:17.660 --> 21:19.350
And what does that have to do with me?

21:19.430 --> 21:20.970
Adamson's record.

21:21.050 --> 21:23.990
He authorized budget cuts to 
special education.

21:24.050 --> 21:28.260
He didn't support the reauthorization of 
the individuals with disabilities act.

21:28.340 --> 21:30.290
What am I supposed to do 
with this information?

21:30.690 --> 21:32.160
Nothing.

21:32.240 --> 21:35.350
I have a source just waiting for 
a word from me.

21:35.410 --> 21:39.280
Once you announce the pregnancy,
he'll leakhe story.

21:40.980 --> 21:42.820
You're good.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.840
Kitty was right about that.

21:44.890 --> 21:46.690
But there's something she doesn't know.

21:46.770 --> 21:49.840
Ten years ago you were doing some 
consulting work for michael breen.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.720
He was running for state senate in california.
Do you remember the race?

21:52.800 --> 21:54.320
It's a long time ago.

21:54.400 --> 21:58.350
I was his opponent,and just as I started 
to get some traction,

21:58.410 --> 22:01.840
the sacramento paper wrote 
an article outing my brother,

22:01.900 --> 22:04.680
who,of urse,wasn't out at the time.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.800
It practically ruined my 
relationship with jason.

22:07.880 --> 22:11.840
It devastated him,not to 
mention what it did to my family.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.100
I almost quit politics after that.

22:14.160 --> 22:22.220
Any idealism I had about public policy or sanctity of 
government was completely obliterated by what you did.

22:22.360 --> 22:25.770
Then stop wasting your time and 
drop out of this race.

22:25.830 --> 22:28.430
This is presidential politics.

22:28.490 --> 22:32.540
And if you're looking for idealism,
you're not gonna win the nomination.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.210
I'd expect you to say that.

22:38.820 --> 22:41.410
All right,well,all your test results look fine.

22:41.510 --> 22:43.560
Your blood pressure is normal.

22:46.220 --> 22:47.520
Want to take a look at your baby?

22:47.600 --> 22:48.910
Yes.

22:48.970 --> 22:50.440
Me,too.

22:51.060 --> 22:52.370
okay,lay back.

22:52.430 --> 22:55.230
Let's put this up,get a little gel on.

23:02.710 --> 23:05.740
let's just make sure that everything is good.

23:13.270 --> 23:14.650
There's the sac.

23:14.730 --> 23:18.160
oh,my gosh.

23:21.640 --> 23:25.180
All right,let me just see if I can,
uh...try and get A...

23:32.110 --> 23:33.760
is something wrong?

23:33.820 --> 23:35.360
Okay.

23:37.350 --> 23:39.550
Kitty,let's sit up...

23:41.050 --> 23:44.680
and why don't you take this and 
wipe the gel off your belly?

23:46.630 --> 23:52.660
I am so sorry to have to tell you this,
but I don't detect a heartbeat.

23:54.030 --> 23:56.610
W-what are you trying to tell me?

23:57.570 --> 24:01.460
I'm afraid that this pregnancy is not viable.

24:15.640 --> 24:17.420
this is lovely.

24:18.110 --> 24:21.920
Can I make you some soup or 
some tea or something?
I want to help you.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.180
Oh,no.I'm--I'm fine.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.220
You didn't do anything wrong,kitty.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.600
That's what the doctor said.

24:28.660 --> 24:32.160
Miscarriages in the first trimester 
are very,very common.

24:32.330 --> 24:33.670
I know.

24:33.750 --> 24:34.930
So you want to lay down?

24:34.990 --> 24:36.850
I'll stay with you until robert comes home.

24:36.910 --> 24:40.690
I think I'm just gonna wait for him by myself,
if--if that's okay with you.

24:40.750 --> 24:42.440
Yeah,I understand.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.850
Thank you for driving. -Sure.

24:46.850 --> 24:48.330
Thanks.

24:50.170 --> 24:54.000
I hate to ask you to do this,
but do you think that maybe you could call everybody

24:54.060 --> 24:57.640
and tell them that there's not gonna 
be a wedding tomorrow?

24:59.430 --> 25:01.100
Okay,thanks.

25:06.780 --> 25:08.600
Bye.

25:26.990 --> 25:32.890
no,seriously,tommy wanted to put a picture of 
lizzie in a bee costume on the label for the new cabernet.

25:32.970 --> 25:34.840
I mean,she's cute,but come on.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.170
Yeah,and babies don't really 
make you want to drink.

25:37.250 --> 25:39.080
Which is exactly your mom's poi,right?

25:39.160 --> 25:41.590
So while they were arguing,
I went back to the files,

25:41.650 --> 25:45.520
and I found a picture of a single 
flower on a grapevine,and they loved it.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.930
Oh,that's good.

25:47.680 --> 25:51.060
Yeah,but what's really cool is that,
you know,once they're on store shelves,

25:51.120 --> 25:54.640
I'll be in the supermarket,and I'll know 
that that label was my idea.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.540
It was completely my idea.

25:57.020 --> 25:57.930
wait,is that lame?

25:57.980 --> 25:59.360
No,it just means you love your job.

25:59.420 --> 26:00.860
Eh,a little lame.

26:00.920 --> 26:03.110
-Thanks,justin.That's sweet.
 -No worries.

26:04.090 --> 26:08.230
would it be completely rude of me to 
ask you what is was like over there in iraq?

26:08.290 --> 26:09.750
I mean,that must have been intense.

26:09.830 --> 26:11.600
It's not-- it's not rude.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.890
Check this out,though.

26:16.430 --> 26:18.210
That's impressive,right?

26:18.740 --> 26:20.200
that's 90 right there.

26:20.280 --> 26:21.860
Yeah,that's great.

26:22.840 --> 26:25.850
So,becca,what's goin' on with you?

26:25.980 --> 26:27.790
Oh,you know,nothing,really.

26:27.850 --> 26:28.970
Same old.

26:29.030 --> 26:30.350
Are there any new guys on the horizon?

26:30.440 --> 26:31.640
No,no.

26:31.700 --> 26:32.850
I--you know,I've been busy.

26:32.910 --> 26:34.910
Yeah,busy playing home health aide.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.500
do y wear an outfit?

26:39.050 --> 26:40.820
What--what's going on with your guy?

26:40.880 --> 26:43.220
Oh,you know,we're just,uh,hangin' out.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.710
So he's a bump buddy?

26:44.770 --> 26:46.320
No. -Yes.

26:46.390 --> 26:47.750
Uh,do you go to the movies?

26:47.810 --> 26:49.300
Well,he's not really into movies.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.070
-Have you hung out with his friends? 
-Not yet,no.

26:51.150 --> 26:52.240
Has he spent the whole night?

26:52.330 --> 26:53.510
Well,he has to get up early for work.

26:53.590 --> 26:55.290
Bump buddy. -Whatever!

26:55.360 --> 26:56.780
What's wrong with just having some fun?

26:56.860 --> 26:59.190
Nothing.In fact,I'm jealous.

27:00.790 --> 27:03.730
Um,I'm gonna get something else to drink.
Do you guys want anything?

27:03.810 --> 27:05.550
Yeah,uh,actually,I'll take one of these.

27:05.630 --> 27:07.250
I'm good,thanks.

27:11.510 --> 27:13.130
what are you doing?

27:13.430 --> 27:15.000
Uh,just meds.

27:15.060 --> 27:20.270
You know,take the edge off the pain
-- war wounds,nerve damage--

27:20.310 --> 27:21.670
You're milkin' it,right?

27:21.750 --> 27:22.720
Is it working?

27:22.800 --> 27:24.550
A little bit. -Okay.

27:24.610 --> 27:26.260
Did they give you anything good?

27:26.380 --> 27:27.510
It's not bad.

27:27.590 --> 27:29.030
Feel like sharing?

27:29.090 --> 27:30.470
please?

27:31.200 --> 27:33.240
Yeah,sure,go ahead.

27:34.380 --> 27:36.480
"jose suarez"?

27:37.000 --> 27:38.140
Okay,busted.

27:38.210 --> 27:39.270
You know,let's just keep it between us.

27:39.360 --> 27:41.750
'Cause if rebecca finds out,
like she'll--she'll flip out.

27:41.810 --> 27:44.720
Like,as soon as I got home,
she's been like...

27:44.790 --> 27:48.310
protective,you know,like,
making my mom look mellow,which is like...

27:48.390 --> 27:49.880
listen,don't worry about it,all right?

27:49.940 --> 27:51.300
It'll just be our little secret.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.560
All right,cool.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.130
I thought you were tapering off.

27:54.210 --> 27:57.260
God,it's--it's my last dose,all right?

27:57.320 --> 27:59.670
I got you a soda in case you changed your mind.

27:59.740 --> 28:01.540
Party time.

28:01.660 --> 28:02.450
come on.

28:02.530 --> 28:03.640
Drink up.

28:03.700 --> 28:05.540
Uh,jason,I've tried...

28:05.600 --> 28:07.410
every number you've given me.

28:07.470 --> 28:15.120
And I know I'm about to leave you the worst answering machine message in history,
but I don't have a choice.

28:15.180 --> 28:17.820
Um,there's no wedding because there's no baby.

28:17.890 --> 28:22.720
Kitty had a miscarriage,
so I'm sure robert would love to hear from you.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.830
I'd love to hear from you.

28:25.930 --> 28:28.370
Anyway,I hope you're okay.

28:29.710 --> 28:31.440
Bye.

28:33.380 --> 28:35.070
I'm really sorry.

28:35.700 --> 28:37.250
Yeah,me,too.

28:38.440 --> 28:40.060
Is there anything I can do?

28:40.650 --> 28:43.200
Yeah,you could deflate the mattress when you leave.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.640
I tripped on it earlier,almost killed myself.

28:45.700 --> 28:46.870
I'm serious,kevin.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.620
After everything you've done for me...

28:49.790 --> 28:52.050
no.No,there's nothing.

28:52.140 --> 28:54.240
Thank you for the thought,though.

28:55.060 --> 28:56.350
Oh,god.

28:56.450 --> 28:58.400
Oh,how's kitty doing?

28:59.180 --> 29:01.250
Yeah,I'll call her tomorrow.

29:01.690 --> 29:03.450
Okay,thanks,mom.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.410
oh,god.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.600
How you doing?

29:13.890 --> 29:15.540
I'm making a card for aunt kitty.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.130
She's gonna love it.

29:18.430 --> 29:20.290
That was grandma on the phone.

29:21.240 --> 29:23.590
Aunt kitty's not feeling too good.

29:23.930 --> 29:26.000
She has to spend a couple of days in bed.

29:26.060 --> 29:27.540
But what about the wedding?

29:27.620 --> 29:30.370
They're gonna have to postpone it,honey,
but she still wants you to be her flower girl when it happens.

29:30.440 --> 29:33.120
But what if we're staying at dad's when they get married?

29:33.180 --> 29:34.070
That's okay.

29:34.130 --> 29:35.450
We'll work it out when the time comes.

29:35.530 --> 29:36.920
No,that's not what happens.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.800
You fight and you yell!

29:39.220 --> 29:41.510
-Paigey. -Leave me alone!

29:49.130 --> 29:50.590
oh,hey there.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.370
Wow,you're drunk.

29:53.450 --> 29:55.590
Yeah,well,you're not feelin' much pain either.

29:59.220 --> 30:00.770
Well,this is awkward.

30:00.850 --> 30:02.400
it's nice.

30:18.520 --> 30:19.710
Ooh mm justin,we...

30:19.790 --> 30:20.740
we have to stop.

30:20.820 --> 30:21.950
What?Why?

30:22.030 --> 30:24.770
We have to stop 'cause you're,um...

30:24.810 --> 30:26.420
you're rebecca's brother.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.110
So?

30:28.950 --> 30:32.240
and we're blocking the entrance to the bathrooms?

30:35.540 --> 30:38.010
oh,it's about that other guy,right?

30:39.540 --> 30:41.460
It's a lot of thin.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.990
okay,yeah,you know,let
--let's go back.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.780
where's rebecca?

31:04.080 --> 31:05.490
How you doing?

31:08.580 --> 31:10.170
You okay?

31:13.980 --> 31:16.000
I had a miscarriage.

31:17.100 --> 31:20.680
Well,actually they call it a missed miscarriage.

31:22.560 --> 31:26.260
I guess the baby died a couple of days ago,
or maybe a week.

31:27.590 --> 31:29.300
Oh,my god.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.900
Yeah,I guess we're not gonna have a puppy.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.600
I'm sorry.

31:36.020 --> 31:40.480
sorry,it's just my-- my pathetic attempt at--at humor.

31:44.890 --> 31:46.420
What happened?

31:47.570 --> 31:49.650
I don't know.

31:49.710 --> 31:51.490
They say it happens all the time.

31:52.200 --> 31:56.900
Uh,I have a-a d&c scheduled for tomorrow where they
-- they remove the fetus,

31:56.960 --> 32:00.780
and--and after that,a couple days of recovery,
and then I'll be fine.

32:03.180 --> 32:04.120
Oh,my god.

32:04.180 --> 32:07.230
No,honey,it's good.

32:07.280 --> 32:12.130
It's nature's way of ending a potential problem,

32:12.920 --> 32:14.750
and we don't have to rush the wedding.

32:18.180 --> 32:20.090
I am so sorry.

32:20.740 --> 32:22.600
I am so sorry.

32:22.660 --> 32:24.210
It's okay.

32:26.750 --> 32:28.280
paige?

32:28.570 --> 32:30.540
Paige,honey,you want to talk?

32:35.300 --> 32:37.020
Paige?

32:37.080 --> 32:38.570
Paige?

32:39.330 --> 32:41.430
That's right,8 years old.Gray jeans,a print top...

32:41.520 --> 32:43.590
call all her friends at school.
Call anybody you can think of,and call me as soon as you hear something.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.390
She's a diabetic.She doesn't have her insulin on her.

32:45.450 --> 32:47.700
Okay,thanks again,officer.

32:48.290 --> 32:49.320
What did the police say?

32:49.380 --> 32:50.600
They're sending a car over.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.560
They're gonna put out an amber alert.

32:52.620 --> 32:54.310
They want me to stay here in case she calls.

32:54.370 --> 32:56.140
All right.I'll drive around the neighborhood.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.710
First weekend she stays with you...

32:57.770 --> 33:00.760
she's stayed with me her whole life.

33:01.390 --> 33:04.760
I told you she was in trouble.I told you.

33:04.820 --> 33:06.270
if anything happens to her...

33:06.360 --> 33:07.370
what?

33:07.450 --> 33:08.900
You'll blame me?

33:08.990 --> 33:10.930
Sarah,you're supposed to be watching her.

33:11.010 --> 33:12.330
She's with you,not me.

33:12.410 --> 33:15.460
Damn you!We did this to her.

33:15.520 --> 33:17.570
Why did you have to make it so hard?

33:17.650 --> 33:19.410
She didn't disappear from my house.

33:27.050 --> 33:28.380
oh,it's mom.Hi,mom.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.870
Sarah,I've got paige.

33:29.930 --> 33:30.940
You do?

33:31.020 --> 33:34.010
When I pulled into the driveway,
she was on the porch,waiting.

33:34.070 --> 33:35.060
How is she?

33:35.150 --> 33:36.100
Fine.But she's--

33:36.180 --> 33:38.170
she's begging me to let her spend the night here.

33:38.230 --> 33:40.290
She wants to stay with mom tonight.

33:40.350 --> 33:42.670
I really think it might be good for her.

33:42.730 --> 33:43.910
You don't have to worry.

33:43.990 --> 33:45.710
I've got an insulin kit and everything.

33:45.860 --> 33:46.890
All right.

33:46.970 --> 33:48.720
Okay,we'll pick her up in the morning.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.410
Thanks,mom.I'll call you.

33:50.490 --> 33:52.130
Okay,I'll talk to you later.

33:59.450 --> 34:01.300
joe,this isn't working.

34:04.130 --> 34:05.980
I know.

34:13.489 --> 34:14.670
Did you get any sleep?

34:14.719 --> 34:15.889
No.

34:15.969 --> 34:17.440
I couldn'T.

34:19.159 --> 34:21.070
I made coffee.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.860
Tried to drink it,but...

34:23.920 --> 34:26.530
I've been off caffeine for so long,it...

34:26.969 --> 34:29.760
to drink a cup of coffee,it just...

34:29.920 --> 34:31.739
felt so final.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.340
It just made it feel so over.

34:34.650 --> 34:36.380
Well,it's not over.

34:36.929 --> 34:38.330
We can try again.

34:39.340 --> 34:41.130
I know.

34:42.989 --> 34:45.120
You know what?It's just-- 

34:45.179 --> 34:48.570
just gonna get through this,
and then we'll be able to move on.

34:48.630 --> 34:50.389
I'm going with you. -No,no,no.

34:50.469 --> 34:51.880
My mom is gonna go with me.

34:51.980 --> 34:53.010
Kitty,I'm comin'.

34:53.090 --> 34:54.110
No.

34:54.190 --> 34:56.969
No,robert.What if somebody sees you or
--or somebody takes a picture?

34:57.030 --> 34:58.380
I don't care.

34:58.440 --> 35:00.260
I'm not leaving you alone.

35:08.360 --> 35:10.210
So you heard?

35:10.350 --> 35:12.570
Yeah,I did.

35:12.990 --> 35:14.580
It's so sad.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.430
so you packin' up her room for her?

35:19.490 --> 35:21.060
Nope.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.730
I'm going home.

35:25.550 --> 35:27.960
wait.Is--is this because of last night?

35:28.930 --> 35:30.930
Are you using again,justin?

35:31.330 --> 35:34.290
Rebecca,I'm taking pain medication for my leg.You know that.

35:34.350 --> 35:39.080
Yeah,and I also know what people look like when they're high,
and last night you were high,justin.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.280
Why--why are you being so judgmental?

35:41.340 --> 35:44.430
Because I have spent every waking minute trying to take care of you.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.510
Well,who asked you to?

35:45.570 --> 35:46.500
Nobody.Nobody.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.230
I have no idea what I'm doing here.

35:51.190 --> 35:52.470
You know what?

35:52.550 --> 35:54.550
Yeah,you're right,
I'm using more than what the doctor prescribed.

35:54.600 --> 35:55.910
You want to know why?

35:55.970 --> 36:00.830
So I can get better fast,
because I'm sick and tired of being here while my friends die over there,

36:00.890 --> 36:03.100
and I can't tell anyone that,because they won't get it.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.250
But I want to go back.Can you understand that?

36:05.310 --> 36:06.920
No.

36:06.980 --> 36:08.210
No,justin,I don't believe you.

36:08.290 --> 36:11.300
I think yoyou're telling yourself that because it seems noble and important,

36:11.360 --> 36:14.980
but you're using because you're an addict,
justin,and you'll always find a reason.

36:24.810 --> 36:26.390
hey,what are you doin' in here?

36:26.470 --> 36:27.640
Waiting for my mom.

36:27.710 --> 36:29.220
She's mad.

36:29.670 --> 36:31.810
Well,people are mad at me,too,kid.

36:35.440 --> 36:40.170
I just--I do things that I know will get me in trouble,
but I do 'em anyhow.

36:42.440 --> 36:44.990
It's been hard with your mom and dad,huh?

36:45.720 --> 36:48.680
I wish I could be two places at the same time.

36:49.660 --> 36:51.320
Me,too.

36:53.840 --> 36:54.920
Kitty walker?

36:54.980 --> 36:56.450
We're ready for you.

36:58.780 --> 37:00.260
I'll be waiting right here.

37:00.380 --> 37:01.700
Yeah,thanks.

37:06.630 --> 37:08.770
This is what I want,so please make it happen.

37:09.640 --> 37:10.870
Thank you.

37:13.580 --> 37:15.060
come here.

37:18.430 --> 37:20.110
Oh,I was worried about you.

37:20.170 --> 37:21.900
I'm sorry.

37:27.540 --> 37:30.010
I don't want you to get a divorce.

37:32.260 --> 37:34.540
Oh,paigey.

37:35.990 --> 37:38.070
I'm sorry.

37:38.550 --> 37:44.510
The thing is,life just sometimes doesn't work out the way that you want it to,

37:44.770 --> 37:50.620
and there's nothing that you can do that will change it,
especially not running away.

37:50.680 --> 37:53.080
But we are gonna change a few things.

37:54.340 --> 37:59.100
From now on,you and coop are gonna spend half your time here,
half your time with me.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.630
You all right with that?

38:02.090 --> 38:03.980
Good.

38:04.370 --> 38:07.570
Go upstairs.Say hi to your brother.
He'd love to see you.

38:15.070 --> 38:16.770
Thank you.

38:23.160 --> 38:24.950
Did you,uh,hear from jason yet?

38:25.030 --> 38:27.700
No,but luckily I have enough work to distract me.

38:27.790 --> 38:30.680
Okay,I cannot let you drown yourself in legal briefs.

38:30.740 --> 38:31.820
It's too depressing.

38:31.900 --> 38:33.200
Scotty,i am depressed.

38:33.280 --> 38:35.550
That's because you miss him.

38:35.780 --> 38:38.070
But there are other ways to deal with it other than work.

38:38.190 --> 38:39.060
Really?

38:39.120 --> 38:40.010
What do you propose?

38:40.090 --> 38:42.910
Well,if you're feeling romantic about him...

38:42.990 --> 38:44.310
"the thorn birds.

38:44.390 --> 38:47.490
" If you're angry at him,"the exorcist,"

38:47.570 --> 38:51.800
and if youe just in the mood for a good time--
 and my personal favorite-- "glitter.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.870
" Let's start with "the exorcist.

38:56.930 --> 38:59.640
Thought I'd drop by before my flight.

39:01.020 --> 39:02.740
How's kitty?

39:02.820 --> 39:05.940
She's at home resting with her family.Thank you.

39:07.700 --> 39:12.690
I,uh,realize it's a bad time,
but I know kitty would want me to warn you.

39:12.750 --> 39:17.490
You've got a potential time bomb on your hands because of what just happened.

39:17.550 --> 39:22.380
If your opponents discover that kitty had a d&c,

39:22.460 --> 39:27.010
and that you went with her,you'd be dealing with speculations that she had an abortion.

39:27.020 --> 39:31.720
If I were your campaign managers,
I'd have a press release written.

39:31.800 --> 39:38.820
I'd schedule interviews for both of you,
especially with female reporters,the daytime talk shows.

39:39.680 --> 39:46.230
That way if the story leaked,
you'd be able to end the rumors immediately.

39:46.320 --> 39:54.500
The two of you look sympathetic,
and your opponents cruel and opportunistic.

39:56.880 --> 40:03.540
My fiancee and i lost our baby less than 24 hours ago,
and we just canceled our wedding.

40:03.630 --> 40:07.500
I have to fly to new hampshire to talk to the family taxpayers' association.

40:07.580 --> 40:13.730
I haven't had a minute to think about what just happened until I was in the hospital waiting room.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.400
And you know what I was thinking?

40:16.480 --> 40:18.730
That I never wanted that baby.

40:19.300 --> 40:23.480
I have two kids of my own already,
and I thought I was done.

40:25.300 --> 40:27.740
And I never told kitty...

40:27.920 --> 40:30.090
and I can't tell kitty.

40:30.550 --> 40:35.460
And I don't know if god is giving me what I want or punishing me...

40:35.500 --> 40:37.230
or both.

40:39.780 --> 40:43.890
So,isaac,if you'll excuse me,
I am gonna ignore your advice.

40:43.930 --> 40:46.890
I haven't quite reached your level of sober pragmatism.

40:46.950 --> 40:49.460
Before i can spin what's just happened to kitty and I

40:49.520 --> 40:52.940
,I'm gonna need just about two hours to feel like crap.

40:55.340 --> 40:57.040
Ir enough.

41:00.850 --> 41:02.680
um,robert...

41:04.790 --> 41:12.010
if after all of this you still want to be president,
and if I can do anything,call me.

41:19.700 --> 41:20.990
how do you feel?

41:21.030 --> 41:24.170
I don't know.I guess just like the doctor said I would-- 

41:24.250 --> 41:27.150
groggy and--and crampy.

41:27.820 --> 41:30.500
She said a heating pad might help.

41:32.220 --> 41:35.300
Yeah,I think I just need to be sad for a while.

41:36.730 --> 41:39.130
You take as much time as you need.

41:41.980 --> 41:43.390
well,I should let you get some sleep.

41:43.450 --> 41:45.370
Mom?

41:47.400 --> 41:49.720
Do you think you could stay for a while?

41:49.780 --> 41:51.350
Always.
