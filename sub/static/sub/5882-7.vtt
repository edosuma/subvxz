WEBVTT

01:01.186 --> 01:03.062
Afraid you'll fall in love?

01:04.648 --> 01:06.107
Something like that.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.151
Well, I can see you haνe good taste.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.736
This is the one.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.196
1 962 Coupe de Ville.

01:12.281 --> 01:14.115
Does everything but make breakfast.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.950
What are you in now?

01:16.034 --> 01:17.952
I had a Dodge.

01:18.036 --> 01:21.122
Those are wonderful
if you want to get somewhere.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.166
This is for when you've already arriνed.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.959
Is that right?

01:25.043 --> 01:26.502
Of course, someone like you,

01:26.587 --> 01:28.963
you don't need to see yourself in a Cadillac.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.923
You're walking about in one eνery day.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.052
How'd you like your car to look like that?

01:36.096 --> 01:37.513
Look at you.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.599
I bet you'd be as comfortable in one of these

01:39.683 --> 01:41.559
as you would in your own skin.

01:43.061 --> 01:46.063
Wayne Kirkby. Do you haνe a card?

01:50.068 --> 01:51.277
Sterling Cooper.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.987
Did Roger Sterling send you?

01:53.071 --> 01:54.989
Yes.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.867
Let me go and get the keys, Mr. Draper.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.765
Don't you want to hold onto these?

02:20.849 --> 02:23.309
I don't know. The '49 rattled.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.436
This is the 1 950 model.

02:25.521 --> 02:27.021
It's quite different under the hood.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.397
Don't talk to me.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.024
Talk to him. It's his money.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.275
I'm just here to make sure

02:31.360 --> 02:33.110
you don't shake his hand
and take his fingers.

02:34.905 --> 02:38.950
Charlie, this car is two years old
with only 25,000 miles on it.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.785
It's what you want.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.956
This must be Mrs. Wheatley.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.375
No.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.884
Why don't you sit in it again?

02:56.969 --> 02:58.344
You two talk.

03:00.264 --> 03:01.764
May l help you, ma'am?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.725
Are you Donald Draper?

03:04.810 --> 03:06.853
Yes, I am.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.564
If it's about my circular,
many of the models are gone,

03:09.648 --> 03:12.400
but I'm sure we can find you something.

03:12.484 --> 03:16.028
I'm not here to buy a car.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.364
You're a hard man to find.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.782
Excuse me?

03:21.702 --> 03:23.911
You're not Don Draper.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.956
Mr. Draper?

03:29.167 --> 03:31.085
Everything okay?

03:31.169 --> 03:32.545
Yes.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.381
Let me take you for a ride.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.632
No.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.385
Thank you.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.220
I don't hear that a lot.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.097
Well.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.599
Have a good day.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.406
Good afternoon, Miss Siegal.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.658
Mr. Sterling.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.243
Is your boss in?

04:04.328 --> 04:06.329
No, but he will be.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.122
Where'd you get that sweater?

04:08.206 --> 04:10.666
I want to make sure
my daughter never buys it.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.127
Klein's.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.337
I doubt your daughter shops there.

04:14.421 --> 04:17.131
Union Square, right?
Is that where you live?

04:17.215 --> 04:19.884
I've told you, all you have to do
is look at my file.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.719
That's cheating.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.140
How was your lunch, Mr. Draper?

04:26.224 --> 04:27.141
Good.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.267
Mr. Sterling's here to see you.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.145
Get Mr. Phillips.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.065
Mr. Draper, Mrs. Barrett called again.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.149
Did she leave a message?

04:35.233 --> 04:36.150
No.

04:36.234 --> 04:39.320
Shall I tell Mr. Phillips you returned?

04:39.404 --> 04:41.238
Yes.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.703
I'll bet she suffers in silence out there,
hoping you'll notice her.

04:47.788 --> 04:51.165
I don't think she cries at night
from lack of attention.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.875
Wait till she finds out about your Cadillac.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.336
She'll be waiting naked
right in front of this window.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.382
Now you're thinking about her.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.175
Didn't you go see Wayne?

05:02.761 --> 05:04.637
I'm going to eliminate
your objections right away.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.263
First of all, you can afford it.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.809
Do you know how inνigorating it is

05:09.893 --> 05:13.521
to go in and write a check for $6,500
and not care?

05:13.605 --> 05:15.189
Secondly,

05:15.273 --> 05:17.692
not to get too deep
before the cocktail hour,

05:17.776 --> 05:22.196
but do I need to remind you
of the finite nature of life?

05:23.573 --> 05:24.865
Mr. Phillips.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.410
Send him in.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.203
Like the song says, enjoy yourself.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.454
It's later than you think.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.207
Martinson Coffee.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.709
Martinson's.

05:34.793 --> 05:35.918
They changed it.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.211
Change it back.

05:37.295 --> 05:40.256
Jim Van Dyke told the people at Grey
they're under review.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.008
So Grey must be scrambling.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.718
It's hard for them to do a lot of new work.

05:43.802 --> 05:47.346
They just redesigned labels,
displays, and dropped the S,

05:47.431 --> 05:49.598
but they have some kids
working on print and TV.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.225
Are they better than our kids?

05:51.309 --> 05:52.977
We'll find out.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.228
Well, you're welcome.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.938
I spent Saturday birding with that man,

05:56.023 --> 05:57.690
and by birding I mean sitting on a stump

05:57.774 --> 05:59.358
with a pair of binoculars, whispering.

05:59.443 --> 06:02.236
Did you see anything unusual?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.947
A refrigerator floating in a pond.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.242
Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith are here.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.493
Just a minute.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.078
Did you let them stay up late?

06:12.664 --> 06:14.248
- I'd love to hear this.
- l don't know.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.001
If l fill you full of any more
confidence, you'll burst.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.258
You don't dance,
or you don't dance with me?

06:24.342 --> 06:26.260
Leaνe her alone. Let's go.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.720
Heard you're gonna knock 'em dead.

06:36.772 --> 06:39.023
Look, Don, it's pretty clear
why we're here.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.941
You want to know
how our generation feels.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.985
Okay.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.863
So, I get this letter
from my friend back in Michigan.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.823
He's still in school, man,

06:47.908 --> 06:49.366
and it's got this, I don't know,

06:49.451 --> 06:50.910
60-page rant in it.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.829
So dig it.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.707
"We would replace power

06:56.792 --> 06:59.752
"rooted in possession,
privilege, or circumstance

06:59.836 --> 07:01.670
"by power and uniqueness

07:01.755 --> 07:03.839
"rooted in Iove, reflectiveness,

07:03.924 --> 07:06.217
reason, and creativity."

07:06.301 --> 07:08.302
That's a beautiful sentiment.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.262
Does your friend know
what you do for a living?

07:10.347 --> 07:13.057
Yeah, there was a shitty note with it,

07:13.141 --> 07:17.269
but this whole concept is deep.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.860
"Students for a Democratic Society."

07:24.945 --> 07:26.570
That's a hell of a focus group.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.323
It's how our generation feels.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.783
It is what it is.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.080
It's idealistic.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.331
That's nice.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.333
Your generation wants to talk

07:39.417 --> 07:42.336
about that newly designed can
and the premium beans,

07:42.420 --> 07:44.380
but we don't want to be told
what we should do

07:44.464 --> 07:45.756
or how we should act.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.842
We just want to be.

07:47.926 --> 07:51.887
You just want to be
selling Martinson's Coffee?

07:51.972 --> 07:53.764
Just listen to this.

08:04.109 --> 08:06.735
So, the thought is,

08:06.820 --> 08:10.072
every maternity ward will get a visit
from a registered nurse

08:10.157 --> 08:12.658
with a doll and a crate of Pampers,

08:12.742 --> 08:16.036
and she will extol their virtues,
which are many.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.538
What did Draper say?

08:17.622 --> 08:18.956
He liked it,

08:19.040 --> 08:21.500
but he said the same thing
he keeps saying.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.627
I can't get them to lower the price.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.839
Do you know the years of R&D
P&G put into this?

08:26.923 --> 08:28.174
Besides, they're worth it.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.426
No boiling, no diaper service,
no plastic pants.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.887
And the greatest benefit of all,
you can throw them away.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.054
1 0 cents apiece,

08:34.139 --> 08:35.681
you kind of think you should reuse them.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.310
Mr. Draper went over these ideas

08:39.394 --> 08:41.353
and had thoughts he would
like you all to discuss.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.692
Well, it's 5:00. Are we going out?

08:46.776 --> 08:47.818
I don't know, sweetheart.

08:47.903 --> 08:48.903
Maybe.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.279
I'll take those papers.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.405
Good night, Miss Olson.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.491
Jane, would you mind
helping us clean this up?

08:57.037 --> 08:58.412
I'm meeting with Cooper tomorrow.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.706
He said he wants to see me and only me.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.291
Isn't that from West Side Story?

09:03.501 --> 09:05.419
You know he's going
to ask you about the picture.

09:05.503 --> 09:06.879
What picture?

09:06.963 --> 09:08.422
Some new painting.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.966
He calls people in to see what they think.

09:11.051 --> 09:15.387
No, I think we're going to discuss
expanding the television department.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.431
I heard it cost $1 0,000.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.225
How does everybody know about this?

09:19.309 --> 09:20.976
Are you making it up?

09:21.061 --> 09:23.687
Last year, Harry went up to the roof
looking for cosmonauts.

09:26.066 --> 09:26.982
Has anyone seen it?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.525
Dale.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.946
It's abstract expressionist.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.530
What the hell does that mean?

09:34.699 --> 09:36.116
Thank you all for ruining this.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.661
You're the one who walked
to the opposite end of the office

09:38.745 --> 09:40.371
to tell us you had a meeting.

09:40.455 --> 09:43.249
Well, if you're lucky,
you'll have a meeting.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.043
And I'm not going to tell you anything
about the damn picture.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.545
Why don't you just go look at it?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.009
I'm sorry, Jane,

09:54.094 --> 09:56.011
but you just don't walk
into his office like that.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.429
But he's gone for the day.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.014
That doesn't matter.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.517
Miss Blankenship won't mind.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.979
I'm going to go up and see it.

10:10.527 --> 10:11.860
I'll go anywhere you go.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.750
Well, she's gone.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.502
What are you doing?

10:29.838 --> 10:31.088
It's open.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.924
Are you suicidal? Let's go.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.010
I can't belieνe you all.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.597
Take off your shoes.

10:41.933 --> 10:44.351
I feel like we're skinny dipping.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.811
Call me from jail.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.605
You're gonna keep a lookout?

10:58.575 --> 11:00.034
Just don't touch anything.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.493
It's a Rothko.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.120
Why the hell didn't Dale say that?

11:05.623 --> 11:07.499
$1 0,000.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.546
So it's smudgy squares?

11:12.630 --> 11:14.548
That's interesting.

11:15.633 --> 11:16.675
Two possibilities--

11:16.760 --> 11:18.552
either Cooper loves it,

11:18.636 --> 11:20.679
and you have to love it,

11:20.764 --> 11:24.558
like in an "Emperor's New Clothes" situation,

11:24.642 --> 11:26.018
or he thinks it's a joke

11:26.102 --> 11:28.228
and you'll look like a fool
if you pretend to dig it.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.565
People like him pretend
they understand this.

11:31.649 --> 11:35.069
Maybe he has a brochure in here,
something that explains it.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.570
I don't think it's supposed to be explained.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.572
I'm an artist, okay?

11:38.656 --> 11:41.158
It must mean something.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.701
Maybe it doesn't.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.787
Maybe you're just supposed
to experience it.

11:44.871 --> 11:48.665
Because when you look at it,
you do feel something, right?

11:49.876 --> 11:53.754
It's like looking into something very deep.

11:56.007 --> 11:57.674
You could fall in.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.387
That's true.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.514
Did someone tell you that?

12:03.598 --> 12:04.932
How could someone tell you that?

12:05.016 --> 12:06.600
This is pointless. Let's go.

12:06.684 --> 12:07.976
I'm ready.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.743
Harry actually took the stairs.

12:25.829 --> 12:28.497
We could have stolen it, couldn't we?

12:28.581 --> 12:30.624
Who are you?

12:30.708 --> 12:33.293
I was thinking I could write
a great short story about this--

12:33.378 --> 12:35.879
you know, "The Day We Looked
at the Painting."

12:35.964 --> 12:37.714
I'm a writer.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.009
I thought you were an accountant.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.636
Accounts.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.430
I've been published.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.557
The Atlantic Monthly, Parabolas.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.226
That's right.
The story about the maple tree.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.645
It was beautiful and sad.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.689
Really? You read it?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.023
Everybody read it.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.733
People were jealous.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.654
Where are you headed?
Are you hungry?

13:00.738 --> 13:02.364
No. Good night.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.172
So you're still working here.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.507
You missed something,
my yellow-bellied friend.

13:20.592 --> 13:23.260
Jane Siegal is a genuine thrill.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.553
Breaking and entering.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.555
I don't care about Jane.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.599
Tell me about Coop's painting.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.851
What about Mr. Cooper's painting?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.110
Enjoy that.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.778
Can I get another coffee here, please?

13:43.281 --> 13:45.240
I'll tell you what I heard.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.075
You, Mr. Cosgrove, and Jane

13:47.160 --> 13:49.203
were in Mr. Cooper's office
looking at his painting.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.705
Anything you'd like to correct?

13:51.789 --> 13:53.874
Mind your own business.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.465
I had nothing to do with it.

14:02.717 --> 14:03.800
Thank you.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.178
Nothing happened.

14:13.061 --> 14:16.730
Look, if Kurt says we don't need artwork,
we don't need artwork.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.106
Is that what Kurt said?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.483
Is that what you said?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.735
Don has his signature.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.029
It's nice down here.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.072
Hey.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.573
Kenneth.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.826
3:00, and he doesn't talk in the meeting.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.040
How about last night?

14:35.124 --> 14:36.833
Quite an adventure.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.838
Listen, l was thinking about
what you said about my story,

14:41.923 --> 14:44.550
about it being sad and beautiful?

14:46.135 --> 14:48.512
You're not like everyone else around here.

14:48.596 --> 14:51.557
I don't know if that's true.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.436
Okay. Here goes.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.855
Would you mind taking a look at this?

15:01.401 --> 15:02.818
Are you kidding?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.820
I don't want you to pull any punches.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.113
Unless you hate it,

15:06.197 --> 15:08.532
in which case, don't tell me.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.866
I'm kind of fragile.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.786
I'd be honored.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.539
Well, great, then.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.374
Take your time.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.543
Ken.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.169
Yeah.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.172
You know, I can probably
read it by Sunday,

15:24.257 --> 15:25.799
and you can come over for dinner,

15:25.883 --> 15:27.134
you know, with Kitty and I.

15:28.803 --> 15:29.970
I know you need a home-cooked meal.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.513
You have plans?

15:31.598 --> 15:33.765
No.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.309
Are you sure it's okay?

15:35.393 --> 15:37.436
You want me to give this back?

15:43.735 --> 15:46.612
Young people do not drink coffee,

15:46.696 --> 15:48.488
and that can become a lifetime habit.

15:48.573 --> 15:50.741
Now, we're aware

15:50.825 --> 15:53.827
that unsuccessful attempts
have been made--

15:53.911 --> 15:55.495
puppets and so forth--

15:55.580 --> 15:58.123
to capture the attention of youth.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.501
That's why we're here.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.170
There's an old saying.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.922
When one is in lndian country,

16:06.007 --> 16:09.509
one needs a man who knows lndians.

16:09.594 --> 16:10.636
Mr. Smith?

16:13.931 --> 16:15.515
So.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.601
Where do we start?

16:17.685 --> 16:18.769
Joe Martinson.

16:18.853 --> 16:19.895
Old cup of Joe.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.271
They named it after him, right?

16:22.940 --> 16:25.442
That's just ancient history now.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.861
There haνe been a million ways
that the folks on this avenue

16:27.945 --> 16:29.946
have tried to tell our generation what to do.

16:30.031 --> 16:32.532
Except we don't want to be told what to do.

16:32.617 --> 16:33.617
That's oνer.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.623
We want to find things for ourselνes.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.625
We want to feel.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.378
Okay.

16:44.462 --> 16:47.005
Martinson's is a great coffee.

16:47.090 --> 16:50.384
It's delicious, and it's hot, and it's brown.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.886
That's all you need to say.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.722
We don't need more than that.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.265
Peggy. Sweetheart?

17:27.338 --> 17:28.714
I don't know if I understand this.

17:30.007 --> 17:30.924
It's a jingle, right?

17:31.008 --> 17:34.052
It's a song, and it's a mood,

17:34.137 --> 17:35.470
and it's a feeling.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.889
It's definitely more than a jingle.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.267
What do you think?

17:41.728 --> 17:42.853
It stays with you.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.190
What are the pictures that go with this?

17:47.275 --> 17:49.276
If you sign, we'll tell you.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.583
So Media Purchases.

18:04.667 --> 18:08.044
Starting in March,
I'm looking at column 5,

18:08.129 --> 18:10.922
under Regional Affiliates.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.095
Mr. Crane, focus, please.

18:17.180 --> 18:21.308
We didn't make you head of television
just to shorten your attention span.

18:21.392 --> 18:22.559
I'm sorry, sir.

18:22.643 --> 18:25.562
I was admiring your painting.

18:26.689 --> 18:29.983
The eye is drawn to it.

18:31.194 --> 18:33.111
It's very modern.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.530
Mark Rothko. I've read about him.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.073
And?

18:38.576 --> 18:40.160
What do you think about it?

18:43.998 --> 18:45.916
Nobody has ever asked me that.

18:47.710 --> 18:51.797
Probably because it's none of their business.

18:53.007 --> 18:54.049
Right.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.303
How does it strike you?

19:00.348 --> 19:03.266
Sir, I know nothing about art.

19:03.351 --> 19:06.895
Mr. Crane, you're here because of numbers.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.021
Stick to that.

19:08.105 --> 19:11.233
Don't concern yourself with aesthetics.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.027
You'll get a headache.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.487
Of course.

19:20.576 --> 19:24.913
People buy things
to realize their aspirations.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.582
It's the foundation of our business.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.795
But between you and me
and the lamppost,

19:31.879 --> 19:36.383
that thing should double
in value by next Christmas.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.055
Where were we?

19:42.139 --> 19:45.225
Column 5 here--
Regional Newspaper Affiliates.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.648
Your hair is turning green.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.358
You have to wear the bathing cap.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.151
It squeezes my head.

20:01.576 --> 20:04.077
Don't leave your wet suit on the floor.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.370
Draper residence.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.747
Is this the belle of the Hudson Riνer Valley?

20:07.832 --> 20:10.083
Who is this?

20:10.167 --> 20:12.168
It's Jimmy Barrett, sweetheart.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.171
Mr. Barrett.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.800
Are you looking for Don?

20:18.885 --> 20:20.427
Because he's at the office.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.847
I know exactly what I'm doing.

20:23.931 --> 20:28.768
ABC picked up Grin and Barrett,
my TV show, 39 episodes.

20:28.853 --> 20:32.230
That's wonderful. Congratulations.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.190
We're having a shindig at the Stork Club.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.567
Donnie didn't get back to me,

20:35.651 --> 20:37.193
so I figured if you're anything like my wife,

20:37.278 --> 20:38.612
you book the dance card.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.948
Monday night,
so the celebrities can come.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.533
That sounds like fun,

20:43.618 --> 20:46.119
but celebrities make me shy.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.704
Keep playing that, gorgeous.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.247
It works wonders.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.792
I'll talk to Don about it.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.544
Don't you want to go?

20:54.629 --> 20:57.130
You can't leaνe me alone
with those people.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.466
Ride the horse in, like Lady Godiva.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.428
I think I should hang up now.

21:03.512 --> 21:04.846
Betty,

21:04.931 --> 21:08.516
it would mean a lot to me
if you were there.

21:08.601 --> 21:12.562
We will try. Have a nice day, Jimmy.

21:18.819 --> 21:19.778
Mr. Phillips.

21:23.366 --> 21:24.866
Right now there's a little boy

21:24.951 --> 21:26.409
running over here from Martinson Coffee

21:26.494 --> 21:28.161
with a check in his hand.

21:28.245 --> 21:31.456
It's done. Congratulations.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.876
Thanks.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.503
You want me to send
for something for you?

21:36.587 --> 21:38.171
No, but don't let me
dampen your spirits.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.090
Unfurl the sails, please.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.637
That was good advance work.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.098
That's my job.

21:48.182 --> 21:50.266
Maybe we'll get a shot at LifeSavers.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.355
Mr. Cooper wants to speak with you.

21:57.191 --> 21:58.233
We'll be right there.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.319
He just asked for you, Mr. Draper.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.540
Thanks again.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.637
Congratulations, Don.

22:27.722 --> 22:29.305
Sit with us.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.642
Thank you.

22:32.727 --> 22:34.477
But I didn't do it alone.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.813
Fascinating.

22:36.897 --> 22:40.066
Jim Van Dyke of Martinson Coffee
was thoroughly impressed.

22:40.151 --> 22:41.526
He's inviting you to join the board

22:41.610 --> 22:44.070
of the Museum of Early American Folk Arts.

22:44.155 --> 22:45.572
That's nice.

22:45.656 --> 22:46.865
What is it?

22:46.949 --> 22:48.324
Doesn't exist yet.

22:48.409 --> 22:51.244
But I've seen the opening exhibit.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.329
Whirligigs.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.373
Do they need a campaign?

22:55.458 --> 22:59.127
No. Philanthropy is the gateway to power.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.546
If you say so.

23:01.630 --> 23:04.257
We need you to continue
your excellence in adνertising,

23:04.341 --> 23:07.135
but also to start treating this
like part of a bigger business,

23:07.219 --> 23:08.511
which it is.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.389
I will.

23:11.474 --> 23:14.225
Do you understand what this means?

23:16.979 --> 23:20.398
You're going to be wearing
your tuxedo a lot more.

23:22.276 --> 23:25.361
It's time for the horse to catch the carrot.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.410
Roger, would you mind?

23:42.379 --> 23:47.008
Would you agree that l know
a little bit about you?

23:48.385 --> 23:50.303
A little.

23:50.387 --> 23:56.476
There are few people who get to decide
what will happen in our world.

23:57.645 --> 24:01.314
You have been invited to join them.

24:01.398 --> 24:06.402
Pull back the curtain
and take your seat.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.913
You're back.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.040
I had a feeling.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.376
You want to take it for a drive?

24:22.628 --> 24:24.754
Wayne, I would like to buy this car.

24:29.552 --> 24:32.011
Jane, would you come with me, please?

24:32.096 --> 24:34.055
Is something wrong?

24:34.140 --> 24:35.348
Just tell me.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.433
You want to have this conversation here?

24:37.518 --> 24:38.685
Fine.

24:38.769 --> 24:43.148
You broke into Mr. Cooper's office
with some executives after hours.

24:43.232 --> 24:45.483
That's not true.

24:45.568 --> 24:49.154
I'm not in the habit
of making empty accusations.

24:50.447 --> 24:53.408
They made me. l had no choice.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.869
Please. They'll do anything you say.

24:55.953 --> 24:57.453
You work for Mr. Draper.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.456
What's wrong with you?

25:00.541 --> 25:02.500
With me?

25:02.585 --> 25:04.043
Yes.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.963
Are you the only one who's allowed
to have fun around here?

25:07.047 --> 25:08.256
What?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.925
Please. I don't need a mother.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.303
I'm 20 years old.

25:13.387 --> 25:15.471
Collect your things.

25:15.556 --> 25:16.848
What?

25:16.932 --> 25:19.309
Get your things.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.311
You can't be serious.

25:21.395 --> 25:24.397
You want to have this conversation again
in front of Mr. Draper?

25:24.481 --> 25:27.483
I'm going to the break room
to find your replacement.

25:27.568 --> 25:31.070
See that you are gone
by the time I return.

25:40.664 --> 25:41.998
Don!

25:43.667 --> 25:44.918
You like it?

25:45.002 --> 25:47.170
I don't know what to say.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.047
It's gorgeous.

25:52.635 --> 25:54.177
Slide over.

26:02.603 --> 26:04.771
It's like the cockpit of a jet.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.274
What's this for?

26:08.359 --> 26:09.943
That is a headlight sensor.

26:10.027 --> 26:13.738
It automatically dims the lights
as you approach another car.

26:14.949 --> 26:17.200
And these seats.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.786
It was expensive.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.537
- Do you love it?
- I do.

26:21.622 --> 26:24.582
Well, you deserve it. You work so hard.

26:24.667 --> 26:28.086
I can't wait to pull up
to the Stork Club in this.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.088
Any time you want.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.549
Monday night?

26:35.469 --> 26:38.429
Jimmy Barrett's throwing
a party for his TV show.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.139
He called for you.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.474
He called here?

26:41.558 --> 26:43.559
He should have gone
through my secretary.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.772
I think he likes talking to me.

26:52.403 --> 26:54.404
The kids won't be home for an hour.

26:54.488 --> 26:56.572
Want to take her around the block?

27:03.247 --> 27:04.664
Not in here.

27:22.933 --> 27:23.933
Mr. Sterling?

27:25.352 --> 27:27.729
I'm sorry. Ginger stepped away.

27:29.523 --> 27:31.107
Well. Hello there.

27:31.191 --> 27:35.653
I just wanted to say good-bye
and thank you for being so kind to me.

27:35.738 --> 27:37.280
Good-bye?

27:39.283 --> 27:41.117
I've been fired.

27:41.201 --> 27:44.078
Draper's a tough desk, honey.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.914
Actually, it was Miss Holloway.

27:50.461 --> 27:53.046
I can see someone wanting
to reprimand you seriously.

27:53.130 --> 27:55.631
But firing? It's a little permanent.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.718
Do you want a drink?

27:58.802 --> 28:00.887
Not like you work here anymore.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.435
Would you Iike
to tell me what happened?

28:07.519 --> 28:08.686
You don't need to bother with this.

28:08.771 --> 28:09.937
I want to.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.400
I'm just trying to do my job.

28:14.485 --> 28:17.445
Miss Holloway is...

28:17.529 --> 28:20.448
Well, she's going through a rough time.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.657
She's engaged, you know.

28:23.410 --> 28:24.452
Tell you what.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.371
You go home--

28:26.455 --> 28:27.663
Where do you live?

28:28.665 --> 28:30.041
In the Village.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.584
Jane Street.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.002
Jane on Jane Street.

28:33.087 --> 28:34.796
That's a pretty picture.

28:37.674 --> 28:40.218
Listen, you go home
to your little apartment on Jane Street.

28:40.302 --> 28:42.553
By the time you come back here
on Monday morning,

28:42.638 --> 28:44.722
this will all be taken care of.

28:46.350 --> 28:47.725
Are you sure?

28:47.810 --> 28:49.435
No more tears.

28:51.688 --> 28:52.772
I don't know what to say.

28:52.856 --> 28:55.608
Thank you, Mr. Sterling.
Thank you so much.

28:55.692 --> 28:56.692
Roger.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.629
That's my favorite tie.

29:16.713 --> 29:19.132
He's late. I was expecting that.

29:19.216 --> 29:20.591
He is a bachelor.

29:28.809 --> 29:31.477
You could smell heaven in the street.

29:31.562 --> 29:33.938
I'd like to take credit,
but it's all the maestro.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.648
These are beautiful.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.650
Don't forget to put
an aspirin in the bottom.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.652
Keeps 'em fresh.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.737
I know that. I told you that.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.614
Can I offer you a drink?

29:43.699 --> 29:45.658
Beer if you have it.

29:45.742 --> 29:48.536
But wine with the spaghetti. Okay?

29:49.663 --> 29:52.665
Your place is...really wild.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.834
Once we decided not
to look for a bigger place,

29:54.918 --> 29:56.711
we just let ourselves go.

29:58.422 --> 30:00.673
How did you two meet?

30:00.757 --> 30:02.008
It's a boring story.

30:02.092 --> 30:03.301
No, it's not.

30:03.385 --> 30:06.554
I grew up a block away from him
in Baltimore.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.765
l guess I just always had
a crush on an older man.

30:11.226 --> 30:14.061
As soon as I moved my mother up here,
Kitty came along.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.063
Come, come. Taste this sauce.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.402
Now, tell me what you think,
and be honest.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.070
I'm fragile.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.700
It's really good.

30:27.784 --> 30:28.784
It's better than a restaurant.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.250
I don't want this hanging in the air.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.461
- What are you talking about?
- My story.

30:39.213 --> 30:40.713
I don't want to sit here
the whole meal worrying

30:40.797 --> 30:44.258
and then find out you didn't read it
or that you did and you didn't like it.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.718
Are you kidding? I loved it.

30:45.802 --> 30:47.720
- Loved what?
- His story.

30:47.804 --> 30:51.265
Yes. He wouldn't stop talking about it,
but he won't let me read it.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.892
I didn't know how you felt.

30:52.976 --> 30:55.728
I wonder if one day
they'll rent this apartment

30:55.812 --> 30:58.272
by bragging about the fact
that you ate here once.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.816
I'm going to be eating here all the time.

31:02.236 --> 31:05.821
To "The Gold Violin,"
by Kenneth Cosgrove.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.830
You really liked it?

31:14.915 --> 31:17.667
I did. It was lovely.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.836
I saw one at the Met.

31:21.964 --> 31:25.424
It's perfect in every way,
except it couldn't make music.

31:25.509 --> 31:26.759
Oh, my.

31:26.843 --> 31:29.095
Well, shall we?

31:46.321 --> 31:48.698
Is Bobby in the car again?

31:48.782 --> 31:50.700
No. He's running around.

31:54.121 --> 31:56.038
So I don't understand.

31:56.123 --> 32:00.376
You'd rather play checkers
than my "look at the clouds" game.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.461
I'd rather play with Silly Putty.

32:02.546 --> 32:04.797
I don't want it jammed between my seats.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.968
You know what, Sally?
Go play with Bobby.

32:12.306 --> 32:14.640
We should do this more often.

32:14.725 --> 32:16.517
We should only do this.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.814
I have to go pee-pee.

32:21.898 --> 32:24.191
Go behind a tree there.
No one's looking.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.823
I want to tinkle outside.

32:30.907 --> 32:32.825
I don't know.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.076
It's different for boys.

32:34.161 --> 32:37.496
I think eνerybody should go
before we get in the car.

32:37.581 --> 32:38.623
Do you have to go?

32:38.707 --> 32:39.707
No.

32:41.835 --> 32:43.127
You kids are lucky.

32:43.211 --> 32:45.087
When I was a little boy,

32:45.172 --> 32:47.757
back on the farm,

32:47.841 --> 32:50.843
we had an outhouse
way out in the yard.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.970
And on nights
when there was no moon,

32:53.055 --> 32:54.096
there was this rope,

32:54.181 --> 32:57.808
and you had to feel for it in the dark
and pull yourself across.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.561
I'm glad we didn't live in the olden days.

33:05.025 --> 33:06.734
Are we rich?

33:09.279 --> 33:12.073
It's not polite to talk about money.

33:12.157 --> 33:15.660
I did it!

33:16.662 --> 33:18.871
We should probably get going
if we don't want to hit traffic.

33:18.955 --> 33:21.415
Sally, pack up the checkers.

33:36.473 --> 33:37.932
Check their hands.

33:42.229 --> 33:43.145
Okay.

34:24.479 --> 34:26.981
You get the last of it.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.524
Should I get another?

34:28.608 --> 34:30.276
You can haνe mine.

34:30.360 --> 34:33.112
Harry tell you anything about his meeting?

34:33.196 --> 34:34.739
Harry's meeting with who?

34:34.823 --> 34:36.198
Mr. Cooper.

34:36.283 --> 34:37.950
He says he knows the answer now.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.702
Well? What was it?

34:39.786 --> 34:41.662
He says I wouldn't understand.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.208
Where do you live, Ken?

34:46.293 --> 34:47.752
Murray Hill.

34:47.836 --> 34:50.713
I can waIk to the office, but I don't.

34:50.797 --> 34:53.966
I wonder if you're gonna get a call.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.510
I'm pretty sure he's going
through the whole roster.

34:56.595 --> 34:59.597
Although, Cosgrove
comes before Crane, right?

34:59.681 --> 35:03.309
My cousin has an advertising agency
in Montreal.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.019
He's not interested in that.

35:05.103 --> 35:08.314
How the heck did you
end up in accounts?

35:08.398 --> 35:12.109
Me and a bunch of my college buddies
heard there was dough.

35:12.194 --> 35:13.986
I was the only one who got a job.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.988
What about writing?

35:16.072 --> 35:17.573
That's just for fun.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.659
It's your hobby.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.420
I should go.

35:31.505 --> 35:33.506
You can't.

35:51.316 --> 35:53.108
Don't you want coffee?

35:54.110 --> 35:57.112
Would it be rude to say that I have
a long ride back to Manhattan?

35:57.197 --> 35:59.865
I can wrap up a piece of pie for you.

35:59.950 --> 36:03.035
- It's pine nuts and pineapple.
- If I eat any more,

36:03.119 --> 36:05.037
I'll burst.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.956
You two have been wonderful.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.544
Thanks for reading the story.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.296
You can let her read it.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.131
I can't wait.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.140
I'll see you tomorrow, I guess.

36:36.111 --> 36:38.320
Do you want to have some pie?

36:38.405 --> 36:41.240
No. l'm not hungry.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.825
I'm just going to clean up.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.995
Do you even care that l want dessert?

36:46.079 --> 36:49.039
Of course I do. l'll go get it.

36:49.124 --> 36:50.541
I'll get it.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.793
What's the matter, Kitty?

36:52.878 --> 36:54.086
I don't work where you do.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.088
I've met these people once.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.591
How am l supposed to talk about them?

36:58.675 --> 37:00.551
Come on, Kitty.

37:02.304 --> 37:04.722
Do you even see me here?

37:04.806 --> 37:06.515
Well, of course l do.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.475
Well, you wouldn't know it, Salvatore.

37:10.103 --> 37:11.770
I'm sorry.

37:11.855 --> 37:14.189
We were just talking about work.

37:16.818 --> 37:18.193
You're right.

37:18.278 --> 37:20.070
It was rude.

37:20.155 --> 37:23.532
I tried to include myself.

37:23.617 --> 37:27.077
A lot of people find me
very interesting, you know?

37:30.874 --> 37:33.959
I am so sorry, Kitty.

37:41.551 --> 37:43.135
It's okay.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.723
I'll get you some pie.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.475
You put your feet up.

37:49.559 --> 37:51.226
I'll take care of the kitchen.

37:52.228 --> 37:53.437
Okay.

38:27.514 --> 38:29.515
I have tickets for the Mets tonight.

38:29.599 --> 38:32.059
Great seats for probably a terrible game.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.185
I'll be by at 5.

38:33.269 --> 38:35.187
No, you won't,
and please don't lurk near my desk.

38:35.271 --> 38:36.689
I'm being watched.

38:36.773 --> 38:37.856
Okay.

38:37.941 --> 38:41.276
Well, have a good day.

38:45.573 --> 38:46.699
Good morning.

38:48.284 --> 38:49.368
Morning.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.453
I was going to call Kitty today,

38:51.538 --> 38:53.205
but I don't know what
it's like with Italian people

38:53.289 --> 38:54.623
if you call someone's wife.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.125
It's okay.

38:56.209 --> 38:58.002
Give her a call. She'd like that.

38:58.086 --> 39:01.380
Well, I just wanted to thank her--
both of you, really.

39:01.464 --> 39:02.548
Every once in a while,

39:02.632 --> 39:04.383
you wish you weren't
a bachelor, you know?

39:05.635 --> 39:08.220
And your home is kind of
what l have in mind,

39:08.304 --> 39:09.972
the way you two are.

39:10.056 --> 39:13.225
Well, we really enjoyed having you.

39:41.254 --> 39:44.798
What on God's green earth
are you doing here?

39:49.804 --> 39:52.514
Did Mr. Sterling speak with you?

39:52.599 --> 39:53.932
No.

39:55.769 --> 39:58.562
What could he possibly have to do with this?

39:59.647 --> 40:03.192
I'll do whatever you want,
but he said that you do this a lot.

40:03.276 --> 40:05.152
Do what?

40:05.236 --> 40:07.279
Lose your temper.

40:07.363 --> 40:10.115
That you're impetuous
and it's not serious.

40:15.371 --> 40:18.832
And what were you doing
talking to Mr. Sterling?

40:18.917 --> 40:21.293
I ran into him on my way out.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.337
Did you?

40:25.381 --> 40:27.966
Is there a problem?

40:28.051 --> 40:30.219
No.

40:30.303 --> 40:32.846
There's no problem at all.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.681
It's very clear.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.089
Everyone looks so glamorous.

41:07.173 --> 41:10.384
Believe me,
they're saying that about you.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.344
It's my earrings.

41:12.428 --> 41:15.180
Do you remember? Bermuda?

41:15.265 --> 41:16.390
I do.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.767
Here he is.

41:18.852 --> 41:20.352
Don Draper.

41:20.436 --> 41:22.312
I heard you had something
to do with this.

41:22.397 --> 41:23.772
Very little.

41:23.857 --> 41:25.440
Betty, this is Andrew Colhold with ABC.

41:25.525 --> 41:26.859
A pleasure to meet you.

41:26.943 --> 41:28.110
And you.

41:28.194 --> 41:30.445
Isn't this a pleasant surprise?

41:30.530 --> 41:32.990
Hello, Mrs. Draper.
You look stunning.

41:33.074 --> 41:34.241
Don.

41:34.325 --> 41:35.826
Hello, Mrs. Barrett.

41:35.910 --> 41:40.372
Don, did Andrew tell you my idea
for working a few items into the show?

41:40.456 --> 41:41.999
Not yet.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.375
Why don't l get us some drinks?

41:43.459 --> 41:45.210
That's okay. Let me get them.

41:45.295 --> 41:46.378
I'll do it.

41:46.462 --> 41:49.840
No, it sounds like you three
have business to discuss.

41:51.759 --> 41:54.344
For example,
a woman's parking her car,

41:54.429 --> 41:57.222
and then Jimmy runs out and says
she's run over his Rolex watch,

41:57.307 --> 41:59.808
so then we show the watch.

41:59.893 --> 42:02.728
Of course Jimmy will need
a Rolex, I suppose.

42:02.812 --> 42:06.982
I don't care, as long
as we bury Candid Camera.

42:15.116 --> 42:17.492
If you're trying to blend
into the wall, you can't.

42:19.495 --> 42:20.621
Hello, Jimmy.

42:20.705 --> 42:22.206
Hello, gorgeous.

42:22.290 --> 42:23.999
What are you doing
standing here all alone?

42:24.083 --> 42:25.792
They're talking business.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.044
I fled.

42:32.550 --> 42:33.717
I'd better not.

42:33.801 --> 42:35.344
I've had too much already.

42:35.428 --> 42:37.387
I insist.

42:39.432 --> 42:41.725
The drunker you are,
the funnier l become.

42:43.353 --> 42:44.770
ABC did research.

42:47.357 --> 42:49.441
Come on.
Let's keep each other company.

42:56.407 --> 42:57.908
I wish l was a mosquito right now.

42:57.992 --> 42:59.868
I would never leave you alone.

42:59.953 --> 43:01.912
Come to think of it,
I never do, do I?

43:01.996 --> 43:03.455
No, you don't.

43:03.539 --> 43:05.374
I'd want you on my arm.

43:08.586 --> 43:12.464
Look at us, over here at the kids' table.

43:12.548 --> 43:13.840
What do you mean?

43:13.925 --> 43:16.009
Them. Your husband.

43:18.554 --> 43:22.182
I've been standing behind guys
like that my whole life.

43:22.267 --> 43:23.558
I was lucky I was funny.

43:23.643 --> 43:27.145
If I wasn't funny,
I would never have gotten to meet you.

43:27.230 --> 43:29.064
- That's not true.
- lt is.

43:29.148 --> 43:31.733
It's hard to believe
there's anything better than you.

43:31.818 --> 43:34.486
Hard to believe he could do
any better than you.

43:34.570 --> 43:36.029
Please stop.

43:38.616 --> 43:41.410
What do you think happened
between the two of them?

43:42.578 --> 43:43.745
Excuse me?

43:43.830 --> 43:46.373
Oh, come on. Look at them.

43:54.173 --> 43:56.508
I don't like what you're saying.

43:56.592 --> 43:58.510
All I know is I know her,
and you know him,

43:58.594 --> 44:00.721
and there they are,
and they don't care where we are.

44:00.805 --> 44:01.763
Stop it.

44:01.848 --> 44:03.765
- Hold on.
- Let me go.

44:03.850 --> 44:06.226
I don't like it any more than you do.

44:08.062 --> 44:12.190
You people are ugly and crude.

44:13.484 --> 44:15.902
What people? You mean comedians?

44:21.701 --> 44:23.660
...a very unusual emergency.

44:23.745 --> 44:25.787
You know what must really annoy him?

44:25.872 --> 44:28.498
All the interruptions
when we're not at home--

44:28.583 --> 44:31.084
signing for deliveries,
answering the phone,

44:31.169 --> 44:32.753
turning on the oνen.

44:32.837 --> 44:35.922
You know I neνer ask him
to do that sort of thing

44:36.007 --> 44:38.383
unless it's impossible
for me to be here.

44:39.594 --> 44:40.552
How about that Thanksgiving

44:40.636 --> 44:42.554
when your car broke down
and Daddy had to leaνe his office

44:42.638 --> 44:44.014
every 1 5 minutes to baste?

44:47.435 --> 44:49.936
Your father neνer complains or anything.

44:50.021 --> 44:52.189
Well, no. Daddy wouldn't.

44:54.901 --> 44:56.651
I guess he wouldn't.

45:00.114 --> 45:01.573
Leaνing so soon?

45:01.657 --> 45:02.824
We didn't get to talk.

45:02.909 --> 45:04.576
Betty's not feeling well.

45:04.660 --> 45:06.119
Too bad.

45:06.204 --> 45:07.662
Here, let me get that.

45:07.747 --> 45:09.539
It's the least l can do.

45:13.920 --> 45:16.922
Thanks to you,
I got eνerything I wanted.

45:18.257 --> 45:20.092
I don't know if that's possible, Jimmy.

45:20.176 --> 45:21.593
I got my relationship with Utz,

45:21.677 --> 45:24.721
my show, my money, 39 on the air.

45:24.806 --> 45:27.057
I'm gonna be an institution.

45:27.141 --> 45:29.309
I'll tell eνeryone I know.

45:29.394 --> 45:31.603
You know what I like about you?
Nothing.

45:31.687 --> 45:33.563
But it's okay.

45:33.648 --> 45:35.482
You got me everything l wanted.

45:35.566 --> 45:36.942
What did you get?

45:37.026 --> 45:38.610
Bobbie?

45:38.694 --> 45:40.612
Lots of people have had that.

45:40.696 --> 45:42.489
Excuse me?

45:42.573 --> 45:44.866
Please. I laugh at you.

45:44.951 --> 45:48.078
I go home at night, and I laugh at you.

45:48.162 --> 45:51.164
I don't know what you think happened.

45:52.500 --> 45:55.961
You. You want to step out, fine.

45:56.045 --> 45:57.629
Go to a whore.

45:57.713 --> 46:00.215
You don't screw another man's wife.

46:00.299 --> 46:01.800
You're garbage.

46:03.177 --> 46:04.719
And you know it.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.640
Well.

46:08.724 --> 46:10.225
Good night, you two.

46:10.309 --> 46:12.477
It's been a gas.
