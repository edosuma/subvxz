02:22.800 --> 02:26.270
Okay, Enid, work with me here.
Pull it in.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.398
Pull in your talons.
We're almost there.

02:34.760 --> 02:38.196
See? I told you I was a four.

02:39.440 --> 02:44.116
No. "Fore" is what you'll have to yell
when the shoe pops off your foot.

02:44.680 --> 02:45.908
Now...

02:48.960 --> 02:50.188
...are we finished here?

02:50.440 --> 02:53.352
Well, I'm not sure
I like this shade of blue.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.392
I'll tell you what I'll do then:

02:56.640 --> 03:01.509
We'll stand you in front of a mirror,
I'll begin strangling you.

03:02.400 --> 03:06.075
When you reach the shade of blue
that is satisfactory to you...

03:06.320 --> 03:09.357
...you yell, "Moo" and I'll stop.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.998
That's it.
I'm taking my business elsewhere.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.117
May I suggest Jenny Craig?

03:26.800 --> 03:29.872
So how much do you figure
you owe this store in commissions?

03:30.280 --> 03:32.316
I'm not selling shoes
for the money, Aaron.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.199
I'm in it to torture fat women.

03:35.720 --> 03:39.395
- Where have you been?
- To buy you a birthday present. Here.

03:43.080 --> 03:45.435
It's Hot Dog... The Movie.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.355
I'd prefer hot dog, the hot dog.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.436
- That's due back at 10 a.m. tomorrow.
- Yeah, I know how it feels.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.558
At least you didn't sing
"Happy Birthday" to me. I hate that.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.911
Nothing to do but stand like
an idiot till the damn thing's finished.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.634
I hope I get through the day
without someone singing it.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.198
- Hey, Aaron.
- Hey, Mr. D'Arcy.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.432
Anyway, Marcie and I just wanted
to wish you many happy returns.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.872
Actually, Marcie wanted to wish...

04:31.080 --> 04:34.356
...that you get caught downwind
from your own feet and die...

04:34.760 --> 04:37.479
...but I wanted to wish you
many happy returns.

04:37.720 --> 04:41.952
Well, thanks, Jefferson.
Oh, and if you see the wife, floor it.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.439
Here you are, buddy.
Happy birthday.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.432
- What's this?
- It's a car-wash coupon.

04:50.680 --> 04:54.639
Thanks, but you know they won't let me
go through the car wash in the Dodge.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.592
Not a regular wash, Al.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.956
This is a topless car wash.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.429
"Soapy Headlights:

05:08.600 --> 05:11.831
Where only the cars wear bras."

05:16.840 --> 05:20.799
And it's conveniently located
just 70 miles out of town...

05:21.040 --> 05:23.554
...at the end of a long dirt road.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.438
But I don't understand.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.877
Both of you are married. Can't you
just look at your wives topless?

05:33.080 --> 05:35.674
- Have you seen his wife?
- Have you seen his wife?

05:37.080 --> 05:40.117
Let me explain. When you've been
married as long as I have...

05:40.320 --> 05:43.039
...you do not want
to see your wife topless.

05:43.280 --> 05:46.238
Speechless, maybe.
Headless, naturally.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.597
But never, ever topless.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.588
Come on, Al.
Marcie's car could use a good buffing.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.274
As could I.
Come on, let's go now.

05:56.520 --> 05:59.239
I can't. I promised I'd go home
for my birthday party.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.153
That's where the kids are gonna
give me God-awful presents.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.437
Sometimes I think that there actually
might be a store out there...

06:05.680 --> 06:08.831
...with presents just for me
that's named "God-awful."

06:09.080 --> 06:13.312
The topper is, Peg's probably gonna
make me a cake as only she can.

06:22.320 --> 06:25.517
Cake looks good this year.
What kind is it?

06:25.960 --> 06:30.351
Well, it's either chocolate
or Uncle Ben's Minute Rice.

06:32.280 --> 06:33.872
- Now, do we have any candles?
- Nope.

06:34.120 --> 06:39.433
Dad said no candles this year,
because of last year's little mishap.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.795
Hey, I just thought that Roman candles
meant that they were imported.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.835
You know, from Romani.

06:49.680 --> 06:53.275
It's amazing.
Dad's looks and Buck's brains.

06:55.440 --> 06:59.592
At least I've never tried
to date one of my plastic toys.

07:02.440 --> 07:03.998
What did you get Dad
this year, Mom?

07:04.240 --> 07:07.516
Well, I was in the mall
and there it was.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.991
There's this new photography studio
called "Sex You Up"...

07:11.240 --> 07:13.356
...and they specialize
in boudoir photos.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.036
You know, where they, like, lay you
on a bed and dress you up real sexy.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.352
Oh, you mean like the picture
on Kelly's driver's license?

07:21.920 --> 07:25.276
That may be, but I've never gotten
a ticket, now, have I?

07:26.360 --> 07:27.952
Gee, I hope I did the right thing.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.634
He said what he really wanted
was an oil filter.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.668
But what's he gonna do
with a silly thing like an oil filter?

07:36.400 --> 07:37.594
Daddy's home.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.114
Is it him?

07:47.360 --> 07:52.195
I can't tell. It's either Daddy
or there's a new pope.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.117
Shut up!

08:08.000 --> 08:11.709
Well, let's get this charade over with.
Where's my cardboard cake?

08:13.280 --> 08:14.713
It's over on the table, Dad.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.832
Anybody wanna light the dog?
I'll make a wish.

08:23.880 --> 08:27.395
Well, wait, Daddy,
you gotta open your presents first.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.710
"God-awful." I knew it!

08:31.840 --> 08:33.831
I really think
you're gonna love this, Daddy.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.150
Happy birthday, Dad.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.112
Two of something I don't want.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.269
That's the second time
that's happened.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.353
Well, we can exchange them
for you, Dad.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.433
Okay, but I don't know
what good it's gonna do.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.918
Excuse us.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.430
We can't be related.

09:24.880 --> 09:29.237
So, what did you get me this year, Peg?
My usual get-out-of-sex-free card?

09:30.200 --> 09:31.428
No, honey.

09:31.680 --> 09:34.592
This year I got you
something really special.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.752
Now, I'm a little nervous about this.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.396
Happy birthday, Al.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.991
Oh, Peg!

09:55.840 --> 09:59.071
- You like it?
- I love it.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.232
Who is she?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.636
It's me.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.109
Now, come on, honey.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.112
Tell me what you really think.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.716
Well, I think you look...

10:46.120 --> 10:47.872
- nice.

10:49.480 --> 10:50.629
Oh, Al.

10:50.840 --> 10:54.150
Oh, now, Peg,
please don't touch me on my birthday.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.439
I want you to take this to work
with you and hang it up...

10:58.640 --> 11:00.358
...so I can be with you all day long.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.916
That kind of defeats the purpose
of going to work, doesn't it?

11:05.840 --> 11:08.638
No more than your paycheque does.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.470
Oh, I'm just kidding,
you big birthday lug, you.

11:13.720 --> 11:17.315
Now, I'm gonna put this right here so
you can remember to take it with you.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.788
I'm not taking it!

11:19.040 --> 11:21.679
It's my birthday.
I'm putting my foot down.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.672
So, what's wrong with it?

11:29.920 --> 11:31.797
I think she looks...

11:32.280 --> 11:33.679
...nice.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.552
It's not the point.

11:36.760 --> 11:39.115
You know why women want men
to hang their pictures?

11:39.360 --> 11:41.351
- So we appreciate...
- No!

11:41.600 --> 11:43.591
It's to mark their territory.

11:56.840 --> 11:59.354
Are you sure you don't want
that picture up there...

11:59.560 --> 12:01.835
...so other guys
can't see how good she looks?

12:05.240 --> 12:07.356
Oh, yeah, that's it.

12:08.720 --> 12:12.030
You see, Aaron, I've been married
to Peg for over 20 years.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.033
I've seen her from the front
I've seen her from the back

12:15.280 --> 12:18.636
I've seen her in a chair
I've seen her in a sack

12:18.960 --> 12:20.791
I've seen her stand,
I've seen her crouch

12:21.000 --> 12:23.468
I've seen her on our stupid couch

12:23.720 --> 12:26.996
I do not lik e her in the mall
I do not lik e her in the hall

12:27.240 --> 12:31.279
I do not lik e her in my life
I do not lik e my big red wife

12:39.040 --> 12:40.792
You're single. You don't understand.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.190
Married men
are never jealous of their wives.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.710
That picture could be all over town.
Wouldn't mean a hill of beans to me.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.354
They could put it
on the side of a milk carton.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.512
They could put it
on the side of the Sears Tower.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.628
They could even put it
on the side of...

12:58.040 --> 13:00.634
Great Caesar's ghost!

13:10.400 --> 13:12.197
I'd do her.

13:18.720 --> 13:22.110
Oh, you're a guy with high standards.
You'd do Marcie.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.239
Jefferson, I gotta get them
to get that sign down.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.754
- How come?
- He's jealous.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.197
I'm not jealous. I respect other
men's rights not to turn to stone...

13:31.400 --> 13:33.675
...in front of my store, that's all.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.235
Jefferson, I want...
Will you stop leering at my wife!

13:36.440 --> 13:37.509
I'm sorry.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.233
You're good at talking to people.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.512
You talked Marcie into believing
you married her for her looks.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.796
Go to that photographer
and get him to take that sign down.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.110
Maybe I can get him
to replace it with this:

13:50.160 --> 13:53.357
A picture I took of the girls
at the topless car wash.

13:53.600 --> 13:57.513
- Where's your car?
- Oh, I took the bus over there.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.630
As long as I went... as I went
through it...

14:00.880 --> 14:02.472
...they didn't know the difference.

14:02.680 --> 14:03.908
- Get out.
- Okay.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.839
It's very important that sign
come down before Peg sees it.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.356
I want you to go outside and look
for her and yell when you see her.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.910
No, not her picture!
Not her picture! Her!

14:18.080 --> 14:19.718
Hi, Al. Did you see it?

14:19.960 --> 14:23.430
Yes, Peg, I saw it.
Ray Charles would see it.

14:23.640 --> 14:24.868
But why is it up there?

14:25.120 --> 14:27.395
The photographer asked
to use one of my shots...

14:27.640 --> 14:28.914
...to advertise his business.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.190
I just didn't think
he was gonna make it that...

14:31.480 --> 14:33.755
Shamu-lian?

14:34.720 --> 14:36.551
Well, I was gonna say "gorgeous."

14:37.240 --> 14:39.708
Kids, what do you think?

14:40.040 --> 14:42.235
Well, I think you look...

14:42.480 --> 14:43.993
...nice.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.229
You could see her from space.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.632
You would know.

14:52.040 --> 14:57.114
Dad, we'd love to hang around
and share your proudest moment...

14:57.320 --> 14:59.629
...but anything just came up
and we gotta go.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.552
Oh, wait. But before we do...

15:01.760 --> 15:04.558
...we want to apologize
for yesterday's birthday boo-boo.

15:04.800 --> 15:08.190
It's all fixed now. Here you go.

15:10.960 --> 15:14.555
Kids, come here. Come here.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.159
Get out.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.472
- Bye, Dad.
- Happy birthday.

15:25.640 --> 15:29.918
Now, Peg, I haven't asked for much
and God knows I've gotten it.

15:30.280 --> 15:33.397
But I think the picture ought to
come down. Now, I like it myself...

15:33.600 --> 15:36.160
...but some people
have been complaining about it.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.470
Excuse me, miss.

15:39.360 --> 15:40.793
Hope I'm not too forward...

15:41.000 --> 15:44.629
...but you are truly one of the most
beautiful women I have ever seen.

15:44.880 --> 15:50.079
And now that I see you in person,
that photograph doesn't do you justice.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.039
It's been a pleasure
to bask in your presence.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.759
Good day.

16:00.880 --> 16:04.429
See, Peg, I told you
that people were complaining.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.833
You know what I think, Al?

16:07.080 --> 16:09.548
I think you're jealous.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.712
Jealous, Peg?
I'll tell you what I'm jealous of.

16:12.920 --> 16:16.799
I'm jealous of any man who can come
home to a cold beer and a warm meal...

16:17.040 --> 16:18.519
...and a wife somewhat smaller...

16:18.760 --> 16:21.957
...than the Bullwinkle balloon
in the Macy's Day Parade.

16:22.360 --> 16:25.830
But if you think for one second
that I'm jealous of that picture...

16:26.080 --> 16:28.753
...you're out of your 9-foot mind!

16:29.200 --> 16:32.715
Boy, I'd love to put the top down
and test-drive that for a weekend.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.959
Yeah, nice little air bags too.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.799
Excuse me, Peg.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.597
With this jealousy garbage out
of the way, that picture comes down.

17:02.800 --> 17:03.949
Aaron, get a blowtorch.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.596
Only if you'll admit
that you're jealous.

17:06.839 --> 17:08.478
I'm not jealous!

17:08.720 --> 17:10.836
Fine. Then you won't mind if it stays.

17:11.079 --> 17:13.275
If it doesn't bother you,
it doesn't bother me...

17:13.480 --> 17:16.278
...other than the low-grade nausea.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.954
All right then. I'll be seeing you.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.760
And you'll certainly be seeing me.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.757
Why can't you
ever say nice things like that?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.788
Why don't you just tell your wife
you're jealous and get it over with?

17:45.800 --> 17:48.155
Aaron, let me explain
something to you.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.277
You don't know anything.

17:50.560 --> 17:54.269
Even if a man is jealous,
he can never, ever tell that to a woman.

17:54.520 --> 17:58.354
Well, that's like saying, " Here's
a hand grenade. Put it down my pants."

17:59.200 --> 18:02.988
Once they know you're jealous,
they've got you by your Bobbitt.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.795
You will have lost
your last ounce of dignity.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.837
And like the once mighty
mahi-mahi...

18:08.080 --> 18:11.868
...you will end up on a pupu platter
in the tiki hut of life.

18:18.560 --> 18:19.788
Any questions?

18:20.720 --> 18:22.711
- Do you want to lay down for a while?
- No!

18:22.960 --> 18:25.633
I don't have time to lie down.
Gotta get that picture down.

18:25.840 --> 18:29.037
I know Jefferson can do it.
He can con anybody.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.153
Hey, Al, guess what.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.913
The "Sex You Up" photographer...

18:33.160 --> 18:38.314
...said I've got the best cheekbones
this side of Rob and Fab of Milli Vanilli.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.394
He's giving me a thousand headshots
for half price...

18:41.880 --> 18:44.599
...and I'm not giving
any of them away.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.715
I know now what I have to do:

18:50.240 --> 18:53.710
Truly go where no man
has gone before.

19:05.080 --> 19:08.117
Fellow Fangsters.

19:09.560 --> 19:13.075
I come before you this evening
not as a man...

19:17.240 --> 19:23.031
...but as a friend who understands
the plight of today's feminist.

19:23.280 --> 19:27.273
True, we have had our differences
in the past...

19:27.520 --> 19:29.476
...but I have seen the light...

19:29.720 --> 19:32.712
...and luckily,
there's not too much in here.

19:38.120 --> 19:41.078
But to prove to you
that I have changed...

19:41.320 --> 19:45.472
...I would like to extend
an olive branch of peace.

19:45.720 --> 19:48.393
A symbol of truce.

19:48.640 --> 19:52.872
You ladies would recognize them
as moustache combs.

19:53.120 --> 19:56.749
Everyone gets one.
Everyone gets one.

20:02.240 --> 20:03.355
Anyway, ladies.

20:04.080 --> 20:07.959
We prefer
to be called "Gyno-Americans."

20:08.560 --> 20:11.552
Then "Rhino-Americans" it is.

20:13.360 --> 20:16.909
Anyway, a grave injustice...

20:17.160 --> 20:20.277
...has been going on
down at the New Market Mall.

20:20.520 --> 20:24.229
A real woman's body
is being exploited...

20:24.480 --> 20:26.277
...by men for profit.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.794
Hang on to your flannel panties...

20:32.000 --> 20:34.355
...there's still time to act.

20:34.680 --> 20:38.309
I want every "gynoceros"
in this room...

20:39.240 --> 20:42.357
...to charge down
to the New Market Mall...

20:42.600 --> 20:44.318
...and stop this dastardly deed.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.756
Show them, as only you can...

20:47.000 --> 20:49.434
...that a woman's body
is not to be appreciated...

20:49.680 --> 20:52.319
...but to be feared, reviled.

20:52.560 --> 20:56.951
And in the case of most of you,
kept totally covered at all times.

20:57.760 --> 21:01.116
Hurry, my sisters, down to the mall,
but remember...

21:01.360 --> 21:03.828
...not more than three
in the elevator at one time.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.630
What our hunting-and-gathering friend
here is trying to say...

21:11.880 --> 21:14.838
...is that we have
important work to do.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.998
We must strike a blow...

21:21.600 --> 21:23.113
...for all women.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.033
This cannot be a slap...

21:26.960 --> 21:28.075
...on the wrist.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.999
It must be a punch...

21:32.600 --> 21:35.831
...in the labonza to all oppressors.

21:36.080 --> 21:39.516
And thank you for bringing this
to our attention, Al.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.478
You're welcome.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.232
Skin him.

21:50.360 --> 21:51.509
And in other news...

21:51.760 --> 21:54.115
...crazed feminists charged
the New Mark et Mall...

21:54.360 --> 21:57.670
...and pulled down an oversized
boudoir photo they deemed sexist...

21:57.880 --> 22:00.075
...after storming
into a photographer's studio...

22:00.280 --> 22:02.271
...where local man Jefferson D 'Arcy...

22:02.480 --> 22:05.950
...was allegedly
posing nude on a bearskin rug.

22:06.680 --> 22:09.319
Mr. D 'Arcy was dragged
by an unnamed body part...

22:09.560 --> 22:13.553
...and flung into the mall fountain
by the howling women.

22:16.400 --> 22:21.190
Women. Can't live with them,
can't herd them all into Canada.

22:22.120 --> 22:25.874
Al, did you have anything to do with
those women taking down my picture?

22:26.840 --> 22:30.355
Peg, on your mother's life, no.

22:32.280 --> 22:35.033
If it's anything I hate,
it's women's bodies being exploited.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.878
It has to stop for all our sakes.

22:37.240 --> 22:39.959
How very liberated of you.

22:40.320 --> 22:43.392
- Where you going?
- To get the car washed.

22:59.320 --> 23:00.753
Dad.

23:02.120 --> 23:04.998
Happy birthday.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.198
Let me guess.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.278
Pants.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.752
Look like these?

23:13.960 --> 23:15.678
Mine kind of do.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.429
I told you he had pants.

23:20.680 --> 23:24.912
- You didn't tell me he had grey ones.
- Yes. I've seen him wear pants before.
