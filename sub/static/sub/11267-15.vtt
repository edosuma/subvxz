90210 #415
"Truth, Trust, &amp; Traffic"
Closed Captioned

00:02.001 --> 00:03.086
Previously on 90210:

00:03.128 --> 00:04.672
How is being a hooker
not a big deal?

00:04.713 --> 00:05.881
I am an escort.

00:05.923 --> 00:07.591
I don't do any of the stuff
that I don't want to do.

00:07.633 --> 00:08.843
Ratting on me
could have some

00:08.884 --> 00:11.219
not-so-good
consequences for
Annie.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.429
She wouldn't do that.

00:12.471 --> 00:13.931
Really?

00:13.973 --> 00:15.891
Annie met
Patrick

00:15.933 --> 00:18.435
because he hired her
to be his escort.

00:18.477 --> 00:19.937
A couple girls kind of
got arrested last night

00:19.979 --> 00:21.814
for prostitution.
What?!

00:21.856 --> 00:23.022
The cops are asking
a bunch of questions.

00:23.064 --> 00:25.400
They can't do anything
without evidence.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.611
The birth mother was a local
girl still in high school.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.154
That's how
we got Maisy.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.323
Maisy?
Navid, we need to talk.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.117
Are you dating the guy
who adopted Adrianna's baby?

00:34.159 --> 00:35.118
Adrianna, I have to tell
you something.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.871
You might want
to sit down for this.

00:36.912 --> 00:38.330
Whoo!

00:38.372 --> 00:39.915
Think I can hit
Holly's window from here?

00:41.166 --> 00:43.210
What the hell kind
of egg was that?

00:43.251 --> 00:44.837
That wasn't a egg,
that was a rock.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.547
Come on. Let's go!

00:46.588 --> 00:48.966
Oh, my God.

00:49.008 --> 00:51.092
Burned to the ground?

00:58.934 --> 01:01.520
Okay, if you could have
anything in the world,

01:01.562 --> 01:02.688
what would it be?

01:02.730 --> 01:03.939
I don't know.

01:03.981 --> 01:04.982
I think I'm already
getting there.

01:05.024 --> 01:07.026
Why?

01:07.067 --> 01:09.069
'Cause I was thinking,
what if we push

01:09.110 --> 01:10.320
this place
to a new level?

01:10.362 --> 01:12.823
I mean, do a total
relaunch of the bar.

01:12.865 --> 01:16.660
Pull out all the stops.
That's an idea.

01:16.702 --> 01:17.661
Good morning!

01:17.703 --> 01:18.662
Hey, smiley.

01:18.704 --> 01:19.663
What's up?

01:19.705 --> 01:21.540
Well, Nick called

01:21.582 --> 01:24.543
and he spoke
to Sonia Reese about me.

01:24.585 --> 01:28.296
As in the Sonia Reese Gallery
downtown.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.257
Come on, guys,
she reps, like, everybody.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.968
Oh.
Okay, anyways, the point being

01:33.010 --> 01:34.887
there's still room
in her next group show.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.805
For you? That's great.

01:36.847 --> 01:39.098
She wants to see
my portfolio today.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.475
It's amazing.
Nick really came through.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.603
He believes in you.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.355
Hook up with the right person,
and anything's possible.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.693
Look, Vanessa, I just don't
think Offshore needs a relaunch.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.071
I mean, I've got as much
business as I can handle.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.281
Yeah, but not as much
as we can handle together.

01:54.322 --> 01:57.659
I believe in you.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.746
And after everything
we've been through,

02:00.788 --> 02:04.416
I really want to give you a
reason to believe in me, too.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.252
Please?

02:09.295 --> 02:11.381
All right,
take your best shot.

02:11.423 --> 02:12.424
Knock yourself out.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.635
(laughs)

02:15.719 --> 02:17.387
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.765
I have to meet a TA,

02:19.807 --> 02:21.934
but I don't even know
what he looks like.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.393
TA's, MA's, whatever-A's.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.895
They're all so N/D.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.105
What's the meeting for?

02:26.187 --> 02:27.106
About a class or something.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.732
Class? Do you even
go to class?

02:28.774 --> 02:31.026
I keep my hand in.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.820
Just because I've found
my calling in event planning

02:32.861 --> 02:35.739
doesn't mean I've given up
my academic career.

02:35.781 --> 02:36.907
You're still event planning?

02:36.949 --> 02:38.700
I thought Rachel fired you.

02:38.742 --> 02:42.037
You could say she pried open
the gaping maw

02:42.079 --> 02:45.040
of opportunity and tossed me in.

02:45.082 --> 02:45.958
Oh, speaking of which...

02:46.000 --> 02:47.960
Does her ring scream

02:48.002 --> 02:50.420
Bel Aire Hotel
or Sportsman's Lodge?

02:50.462 --> 02:51.922
BOTH:
Bel Aire.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.632
Then you are looking at

02:53.674 --> 02:54.675
my very first event to plan.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.010
Ta-ta.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.136
(both chuckle)

02:57.176 --> 02:58.345
I should get going, too.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.430
Really?

03:00.472 --> 03:02.599
We haven't talked
since Thanksgiving.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.476
Are you seriously going
to keep running away?

03:04.518 --> 03:05.477
Just say it.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.478
The whole escorting thing.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.688
I know what you're thinking.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.857
I just want to know
how you are.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.109
I am trying to get back
to normal life.

03:12.151 --> 03:14.193
And I've been getting
my inheritance checks,

03:14.235 --> 03:15.863
so money's not a problem now.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.280
You don't have
to worry about me.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.323
But I do.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.992
Because what you did
with Patrick,

03:20.034 --> 03:21.702
is just so not like you.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.787
How do you get from this to...?

03:23.829 --> 03:25.330
Do you think I haven't
asked myself that

03:25.372 --> 03:26.748
a thousand times?

03:26.790 --> 03:28.709
It started off as nothing.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.669
Me and that Bree girl
just hanging out

03:30.711 --> 03:32.087
with some guys.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.506
But I swear, it's over now.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.091
I'm not seeing Patrick
anymore, ever,

03:36.133 --> 03:37.843
and no one else like him.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.469
Good.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.225
Oh, there's Greg.

03:45.266 --> 03:46.518
Oh!

03:46.560 --> 03:47.352
Great. Thanks.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.188
I'm glad we got to talk.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.981
I'll catch up with you later.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.863
Annie! Hooray!

03:57.905 --> 03:59.573
You are the exact person
I was looking for.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.949
What do you want?

04:00.991 --> 04:03.368
Wow, that's not a really
friendly way to talk.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.995
I just lost everything
in the Kappa fire.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.538
Don't you even care?

04:06.580 --> 04:07.998
I'm sorry, that was awful.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.042
Um, well, at least
no one got hurt, right?

04:10.084 --> 04:13.336
Still, I need a place

04:13.378 --> 04:16.630
to lay my poor
little homeless head.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.382
Naomi has a ton of space,
doesn't she?

04:18.425 --> 04:19.968
No, no. Bad idea.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.469
No, good idea.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.180
How am I supposed
to find an apartment

04:23.222 --> 04:24.598
when the 405 is closed
all weekend?

04:24.639 --> 04:25.682
Bree, think.

04:25.724 --> 04:26.683
The police are still
investigating

04:26.725 --> 04:27.684
your little business, right?

04:27.726 --> 04:28.643
Probably not the best idea

04:28.685 --> 04:29.895
for us to be hanging out
together.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.479
You're such a worrywart.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.898
Come on.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.108
That investigation
is going nowhere.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.818
Haven't I always
been there for you?

04:36.860 --> 04:40.488
Is it that big of a deal
to ask you to be here for me?

04:42.490 --> 04:46.078
Okay, I might know somewhere you
can crash for a couple of days.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.412
You should not be burdened

04:47.454 --> 04:48.956
with nerve-wracking details

04:48.997 --> 04:50.916
like where to sit your toxic
great aunt

04:50.958 --> 04:52.918
so that she doesn't feel
slighted, but she doesn't

04:52.960 --> 04:55.545
accidentally communicate
with the future in-laws.

04:55.587 --> 04:58.132
Oh, my God, that is Aunt Yvonne.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.467
This's why you need me
to plan your event.

05:00.508 --> 05:05.722
My motto is:
"See, respond, neutralize."

05:05.764 --> 05:06.807
Really?

05:06.848 --> 05:07.808
'Cause you haven't seen

05:07.849 --> 05:09.935
or responded to me,
Ms. Clark,

05:09.977 --> 05:12.395
and I've been here, in this
room, for a long time.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.522
Sorry.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.024
You are?

05:16.066 --> 05:18.652
Hal Blor, your TA
for Physics 100.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.403
We had a meeting set
for 10:00 a.m.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.404
Call me.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.573
Oh, my God, Hal Blor!

05:23.615 --> 05:24.574
I am so sorry.

05:24.616 --> 05:25.575
Here, please.

05:25.617 --> 05:26.910
I must've lost track of time.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.579
You seem to lose track
of time a lot, Ms. Clark.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.206
And I'm sure I will again

05:31.248 --> 05:33.250
now that I'm talking
to you, Mr. Blor.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.960
Well, let me help you focus.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.254
Your final project was due
three days ago.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.547
Physics 100 is part
of the core curriculum.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.049
If you fail this class,

05:41.091 --> 05:42.341
you won't move on
to sophomore year.

05:42.383 --> 05:43.551
Wait. What?

05:43.593 --> 05:45.179
There's got to be
something I can do.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.973
Extra credit
or an extension, or...

05:48.015 --> 05:51.226
Have you ever heard the Physics
term "Letting it slide"?

05:51.268 --> 05:53.854
Good one.
Did you come up with that

05:53.895 --> 05:55.314
when you were scrolling
through texts

05:55.396 --> 05:56.857
instead of listening
in class?

05:56.898 --> 05:59.026
Oh, my God, I should not be
punished for multitasking!

05:59.067 --> 06:00.568
I'm hideously busy.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.778
With what?

06:01.820 --> 06:03.197
Throwing parties?

06:03.238 --> 06:05.782
Yeah, parties not
everyone's invited to?

06:05.824 --> 06:08.160
If I ever had a party
and failed to invite you...

06:08.202 --> 06:10.495
Five in the last semester
alone, actually.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.331
And I saw you making
the invitation list

06:12.371 --> 06:14.791
to Strip the Vote in
your Physics notebook.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.084
Oh, my God.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.212
I'm mortified.

06:18.253 --> 06:22.216
Hal, I'm so sorry I forgot
to remember to invite you.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.009
That was a mistake.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.594
Your mistake was
neglecting Physics 100.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.723
I don't care about
your stupid parties.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.480
Rule number one for
getting away with stuff--

06:37.522 --> 06:39.316
never return to the
scene of the crime.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.442
Hey, we are out of
toilet paper again.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.904
What do you guys do,
throw the stuff out the window?

06:43.945 --> 06:44.988
Oh, God.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.698
I'll pick some up after class.

06:46.740 --> 06:47.741
Thanks.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.993
Are you okay?

06:50.035 --> 06:51.828
Yeah, man.
I'm just nervous.

06:51.870 --> 06:55.832
Uh... about your laundry
in the dryer, man.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.334
It's been in there
for a while.

06:57.376 --> 06:58.793
It's gonna get wrinkled.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.300
(quietly):
Stop acting guilty.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.801
Okay? You're gonna
screw us both.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.053
You don't care that we burned
down the Kappa House?

07:08.095 --> 07:09.054
Of course I care, okay?

07:09.096 --> 07:10.097
It was an accident.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.181
Nobody got hurt.

07:11.223 --> 07:12.515
They lost a couple of
Ryan Gosling posters.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.475
Just forget about
the whole thing, okay?

07:14.517 --> 07:15.518
Okay.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.978
ANNIE:
Anybody home?
Hey.

07:17.020 --> 07:17.979
Hi.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.480
Oh, hey, guys.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.608
It's, it's, look,
it's my sister Annie

07:21.649 --> 07:24.069
and her friend
the Kappa, Bree.

07:24.111 --> 07:27.697
Okay, so you guys know that
the Kappa house burned down.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.950
BREE:
Yeah.

07:29.991 --> 07:33.745
So, anyway, uh, Bree
needs a place to stay.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.373
And I thought
that you guys...

07:36.415 --> 07:37.457
Just for a couple of days.
Please.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.126
It'd be a really
big help to me.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.585
Oh, to Bree.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.129
Gosh, Bree,
you know, it sucks

07:42.170 --> 07:42.712
about the Kappa House
burning down.

07:42.754 --> 07:43.964
And don't get us wrong...

07:44.005 --> 07:45.799
Yeah, yeah, please, please,
don't get us wrong.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.592
Uh, it's just that we have
little space here.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.010
You know,
Navid's on the couch.

07:49.052 --> 07:52.013
Yeah, totally.
NAVID: Bree just lost
everything.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.181
I don't mind sleeping on
the floor

07:53.223 --> 07:54.682
for a couple days.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.018
Really?
Great! See?

07:57.060 --> 07:58.145
Thank you, guys.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.272
You are the best!

08:00.314 --> 08:01.440
Thank you. Thank you.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.190
BREE: It'll be
really fun.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.191
Promise.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.069
♪ ♪

08:09.697 --> 08:11.116
Hey.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.784
You like it?

08:12.826 --> 08:15.036
What is all this?

08:15.078 --> 08:19.666
Uh, It's my plan
to relaunch the Offshore.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.876
You won't believe
what I've got done already.

08:21.918 --> 08:25.172
And everything is
right on track for tomorrow.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.214
Wait. Tomorrow?

08:26.256 --> 08:27.590
Tomorrow's Carmageddon.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.092
They're telling everyone
not to drive.

08:29.134 --> 08:32.471
Which is why it's the perfect
day for the relaunch.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.763
I mean,
think about it.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.597
There was no traffic
last time, right?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.433
So this time, people will think,

08:37.476 --> 08:41.020
"Hey, no traffic, clear skies...

08:41.062 --> 08:42.063
let's head to the beach."

08:42.105 --> 08:45.525
We can't count on that.

08:45.566 --> 08:46.485
This beer, this is expensive.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.069
How'd you pay for this?

08:48.111 --> 08:49.946
I just used grabbed the cash
from the register.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.865
That money was meant
for the bank.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.034
How am I supposed to pay
my bills this month?

08:54.075 --> 08:55.743
Okay, well, you said,

08:55.785 --> 08:57.954
"Go ahead.
Knock yourself out."

08:57.996 --> 08:59.831
I don't do anything halfway.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.251
Liam, this bar opening,
it's gonna be a huge success.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.254
Yeah,
now it's gonna have to be.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.719
GREG: I have a conference
tonight in San Diego,

09:12.760 --> 09:14.637
but I still need
to drive back to get Maisy

09:14.679 --> 09:15.430
before lunch tomorrow.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.557
Thank you.
Keep the change.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.267
And the freeway's being
shut down again.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.685
Ugh! Carmageddon!

09:20.727 --> 09:22.812
Nobody drove
last time, remember?

09:22.854 --> 09:24.398
Yeah, I know, but my
sitter has the flu

09:24.439 --> 09:26.233
and I can't be late.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.485
If you're worried about getting
back in time, I can pick her up.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.903
No, you don't have to do that.

09:29.944 --> 09:30.904
Don't be silly.

09:30.945 --> 09:31.821
Maisy is great.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.573
It will be a total favor to me.

09:33.614 --> 09:34.908
Plus we're
gonna be spending

09:34.949 --> 09:36.284
a lot of time together
in New York,

09:36.326 --> 09:37.702
so she ought
to get to know me.

09:37.744 --> 09:38.953
Just tell me where
and what time.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.205
Wow.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.206
All right, thanks.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.623
That's a real lifesaver.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.125
It's just that
little school

09:44.167 --> 09:45.377
right on Olympic and Holmby.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.003
You can't miss it.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.922
Noon. I'll call ahead
and tell them to expect you.

09:48.963 --> 09:49.714
Perfect.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.716
I better get ready to go here.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.343
(sighs)

09:53.385 --> 09:54.344
All right.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.762
Good luck.

09:55.803 --> 09:58.056
Thanks.
Yeah.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.100
So what Navid
told me was true.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.894
Have you been standing there?

10:02.936 --> 10:04.479
I heard it all.

10:04.521 --> 10:07.607
You are not going
to raise my daughter, Silver.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.670
Why are you dating the man
who adopted my baby?

10:29.712 --> 10:31.256
Are you trying
to get back at me?

10:31.298 --> 10:32.966
You think this is about you?

10:33.007 --> 10:35.176
I didn't even know about Maisy
when I met Greg.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.554
Yeah, but then you find out
and you don't say anything.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.306
Because there's nothing to say!

10:39.347 --> 10:41.015
I can date who I want.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.267
Greg is divorced.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.935
That's not what
I wanted for Maisy!

10:43.977 --> 10:47.314
There's a reason I chose
Greg and Leslie, okay?

10:47.355 --> 10:49.065
I gave her to a happy family,

10:49.107 --> 10:50.942
not to some jerk who's moving
to New York

10:50.984 --> 10:52.611
with an 18-year-old girl
who hates me!

10:52.652 --> 10:53.736
Life goes on, Adrianna.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.323
People split up.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.365
I have to talk to Greg.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.160
No! You chose not
to be in Maisy's life.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.536
She's not your child, she's his.

11:01.578 --> 11:02.954
Just stay out of it.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.747
You cannot tell me what to do.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.087
SONIA:
I only have so many square feet
of exhibition space,

11:11.129 --> 11:12.506
so I choose carefully.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.257
And I haven't repped
a new photographer

11:14.299 --> 11:16.050
since I brought Nick in
three years ago.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.347
Did you, um...
study with him?

11:20.388 --> 11:22.474
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh,
I took his class at CU,

11:22.516 --> 11:24.892
and then, um, then we went
down to New Guinea

11:24.934 --> 11:25.726
and we did a shoot together,

11:25.768 --> 11:27.228
so I've definitely
learned a lot from him.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.855
Mm. I see.

11:28.896 --> 11:31.899
Well, that must have been quite
the educational experience.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.985
(wry laugh)

11:34.027 --> 11:35.028
So you're seeing each other.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.531
Uh... well, yeah.

11:37.572 --> 11:40.741
Uh, he's in Afghanistan
at the moment, so...

11:40.783 --> 11:43.537
sort of seeing each other via
Skype, you know how that goes,

11:43.578 --> 11:45.746
but...
Oh, no, I do know.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.541
I went out with Nick
until about a year ago.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.253
Oh.

11:52.295 --> 11:55.006
Um...

11:55.048 --> 11:55.756
I'm afraid these aren't for me.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.602
(groans with frustration)

12:07.644 --> 12:09.563
Hey, Naomi, I need a favor.
Liam! Thank God.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.439
Oh! You're good with
your hands, as I recall.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.692
I have to build
something that demonstrates

12:13.732 --> 12:16.277
a basic knowledge of physics,
which I do not have.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.487
Can you help me?

12:17.529 --> 12:19.822
Maybe. If I knew what
you were talking about.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.825
I am talking about Hal Blor,
my pleasure-deprived TA,

12:22.867 --> 12:25.328
who has no idea how
little time I have to...

12:25.370 --> 12:26.787
balance things on sticks!

12:26.829 --> 12:29.666
I read the books,
I attended class--

12:29.708 --> 12:31.209
part of the time-- I just...

12:31.251 --> 12:33.002
I'm not good at
this kind of stuff.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.795
I never would've made it
through high school science

12:34.837 --> 12:37.382
without... help.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.093
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
you would help me.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.678
I got a problem with Vanessa.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.638
Really?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.390
Which one of her fake names
ran you over this time?

12:45.432 --> 12:46.891
Yes... that was an accident.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.059
I'm over it.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.144
As much as you can get over
being run down

12:50.186 --> 12:51.187
by a girl with an alias.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.855
But this is different.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.941
Um, she wants to do
a re-opening of Offshore.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.817
That sounds like a good idea.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.446
She took all my ready cash
and spent it on some scheme

12:59.487 --> 13:01.239
to open tomorrow,
during Carmageddon.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.782
Mm, that part doesn't
sound so trustworthy.

13:03.824 --> 13:04.825
Well, I kind of said
it was okay.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.579
I just didn't think
it was going to get this crazy.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.497
So I was kind of hoping that
you could use your knowledge

13:09.539 --> 13:12.500
of parties to help me?

13:12.542 --> 13:13.918
Yes. Done.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.671
A party is the exact kind of
project I need right now.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.257
Would you mind if I invite
a special friend?
Sure. Why?

13:19.299 --> 13:20.799
Let's say I may
be able to balance

13:20.841 --> 13:22.761
my TA's need for
a little good time

13:22.801 --> 13:24.845
with my lack of time
to do his stupid project.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.432
This is perfect! Yay!

13:27.474 --> 13:29.476
Cool.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.896
♪ ♪

13:33.938 --> 13:36.232
This chicken is amazing.

13:36.274 --> 13:37.651
Mm-hmm.
Well, thank you.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.193
Me and Austin always try
to cook in the house,

13:39.235 --> 13:41.738
but we always wind up
nearly burning the... uh....

13:41.780 --> 13:44.240
the house down.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.617
You didn't have to
do this, Bree.

13:45.659 --> 13:48.035
Oh, please. You guys are
so generous and kind

13:48.077 --> 13:50.288
just to let me stay here,
it's the least I could do.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.123
Well, it's the least
we could do.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.458
Yeah, you know, you got
burned out of your house.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.460
By the way, are there any,
um... updates, or anything?

13:55.502 --> 13:56.586
Bree doesn't want to
talk about that.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.087
No, it's fine.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.089
I mean, it was awful.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.882
You know that they
vandalized the place, too?

14:01.924 --> 14:03.635
Oh, yeah?
Wow.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.554
TP'd the trees, egged the house,
typical loser stuff.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.765
I mean, it's so obvious that
these jerks were the ones that

14:08.807 --> 14:11.434
started the fire, but...
for some reason,

14:11.476 --> 14:13.019
the Fire Marshal
won't let it go.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.061
He says the fire

14:14.103 --> 14:15.605
started in the bathroom,
and that it looks like

14:15.647 --> 14:17.691
arson, not just some prank.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.109
You said the bathroom, right?
Yeah.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.235
Here you go.
BREE: Thank you.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.903
Was there a broken window
in the bathroom?

14:22.945 --> 14:24.905
More importantly,
do I smell apple pie?

14:24.947 --> 14:25.990
Why, yes indeed, you do.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.951
(laughs)

14:30.161 --> 14:31.746
(sighs)
Did you hear that?

14:31.788 --> 14:34.541
The rock you threw didn't
break a bathroom window.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.751
Maybe we didn't start the fire.
That's gonna be your defense?

14:36.793 --> 14:38.919
When we vandalized the house,
we broke the wrong window?

14:38.961 --> 14:41.673
Look, dude, I'm just saying...
You're just saying too much,
okay? I'm not going to go down

14:41.715 --> 14:43.800
because you can't keep your
mouth shut and need to confess.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.093
Okay, nobody needs to know
we trashed that house.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.094
Understand?

14:47.136 --> 14:49.514
Okay.
Okay.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.310
You guys look so serious.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.145
What are you talking about,
the European debt crisis?

14:56.187 --> 14:58.356
No, just... how much
we love apple pie.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.233
Yes. Pie. Mmm!

15:00.274 --> 15:01.901
Dig in.

15:01.942 --> 15:02.777
All right.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.612
Will do.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.535
(children laughing, shouting)

15:18.959 --> 15:20.378
Can I help you?

15:20.420 --> 15:23.089
Yeah. Uh, I'm here
to pick up Maisy.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.006
Her father called.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.633
I'm Erin Silver.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.427
No problem.

15:43.526 --> 15:44.611
Liam, look!

15:44.652 --> 15:45.986
We can fit so many
more people in here

15:46.028 --> 15:47.614
if we just kind of
encourage the flow

15:47.655 --> 15:48.656
out onto the beach, and...

15:48.698 --> 15:49.866
Hi.

15:49.908 --> 15:51.951
I'm Naomi Clark.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.661
You must be Vanessa.
Uh-huh.

15:53.703 --> 15:56.873
Naomi's here to help.
Well, um, I don't
need any help.

15:56.915 --> 15:58.958
See, I have a plan

15:58.999 --> 16:01.795
to make Liam and
the Offshore a brand.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.631
It's a contest.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.257
I replace one of these

16:06.299 --> 16:09.176
hundreds of beer bottle caps
with this one.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.512
Whoever gets it, gets to
drink free for a month,

16:11.554 --> 16:14.849
here at the Offshore, with...
Liam Court.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.142
We'll sell an awful
lot of beer that way.

16:16.183 --> 16:17.143
I like it.

16:17.184 --> 16:18.227
But you're going to need

16:18.269 --> 16:19.562
a little bit more
than just a contest

16:19.604 --> 16:21.815
and free beer to
make the event work.
Listen to Naomi.

16:21.856 --> 16:24.233
She is an expert.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.944
Supplement the bottle cap
contest by making

16:25.985 --> 16:27.737
the beer itself more exclusive.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.238
I know a printer who can do

16:29.280 --> 16:30.448
a rush order on labels
for these bottles

16:30.490 --> 16:31.741
with a shot of Liam
from his billboard.

16:31.783 --> 16:32.742
No. No. Not that again.

16:32.784 --> 16:33.952
I like it. Keep talking.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.620
Make it the kind of party

16:35.662 --> 16:36.830
that people who don't
usually go to parties

16:36.871 --> 16:37.997
will be dying to attend.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.624
Set up a VIP list,

16:39.666 --> 16:41.626
great music, great food,

16:41.668 --> 16:42.836
a band...
Band?

16:42.877 --> 16:44.128
Naomi, who's gonna pay for this?

16:44.170 --> 16:45.755
You have to spend money
to make money, honey.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.590
I think we should listen to her.

16:47.632 --> 16:50.635
I mean, after all,
she's the expert.

16:54.597 --> 16:57.266
I cannot believe you told
Adrianna that I'm seeing Greg.

16:57.308 --> 16:59.560
Navid, you and I have
had our problems, okay,

16:59.602 --> 17:02.647
but the idea that you would
betray my trust, and tell...

17:02.689 --> 17:04.816
There was no way
she wouldn't find out.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.651
I-I'm tired of secrets.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.777
Secrets almost ruined my life.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.444
So you decide to ruin mine.

17:09.487 --> 17:10.905
You do realize that
Adrianna's crazy, right?

17:10.946 --> 17:12.114
That is not fair.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.115
Ade has changed.

17:13.156 --> 17:14.826
Oh, my...
(cell phone chimes)

17:14.867 --> 17:16.869
It's Greg.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.038
"Thanks for picking up Maisy.
I'm on my way."

17:19.079 --> 17:20.874
What? I didn't...

17:20.915 --> 17:22.500
"You were even early.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.917
I hope you girls
are having fun."

17:24.961 --> 17:26.753
Oh, my God, I didn't...

17:26.796 --> 17:29.215
I didn't pick up Maisy.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.383
Wait-wait, what are you
talking about?

17:30.424 --> 17:32.802
It was Adrianna, Navid.

17:32.844 --> 17:35.680
She heard Greg asking me
to do it, she...

17:35.722 --> 17:36.848
She just kidnapped Maisy!

17:37.724 --> 17:38.892
I gotta call the cops!

17:38.933 --> 17:40.184
Whoa, hey, wait,
let's just think about this

17:40.226 --> 17:41.477
for a minute, okay?

17:41.519 --> 17:42.937
Hey, Silver.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.271
Ade won't hurt Maisy.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.815
Right. Yeah.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.274
'Cause everything is fine.
Adrianna's changed.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.360
Now just listen!
She loves Maisy.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.905
Come on!
Okay? She's been
wanting to see her.

17:51.946 --> 17:55.157
She heard you were all
going to New York, and...

17:55.199 --> 17:56.617
she just must have
felt desperate.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.411
It doesn't matter
how Adrianna feels.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.705
This is Greg's child.
What am I supposed to tell him?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.122
Navid, what am I
supposed to say?

18:02.164 --> 18:04.584
We'll find Ade and Maisy
before he gets back, okay?

18:04.625 --> 18:06.085
I'm sure Ade is close by.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.046
Let's go. I'll help you look.

18:08.671 --> 18:12.174
Go.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.593
IVY:
It's-it's unfair.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.428
While I don't want to be
the girl who gets the show

18:15.469 --> 18:16.846
just because
I slept with some guy,

18:16.888 --> 18:17.597
I also don't
want to be the girl

18:17.638 --> 18:20.349
who does not get the show just
'cause I slept with some guy.

18:20.391 --> 18:22.769
Sleeping with some guy is at the
bottom of a lot of bad scenes.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.311
Oh, before I forget:
there were cops

18:24.353 --> 18:26.146
here today. Um...

18:26.188 --> 18:27.899
Something about some
investigation going on

18:27.941 --> 18:29.358
with the Kappas?

18:29.400 --> 18:30.651
Wait-- there's still
an investigation?

18:30.693 --> 18:32.152
They said they were
interviewing Kappa girls,

18:32.194 --> 18:34.113
and I said you were
no longer a Kappa girl.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.615
Bree said it was over.

18:35.656 --> 18:36.950
Okay, so... I don't know.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.034
Talk to Bree about it.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.201
I gotta go.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.250
Man, people are
way sensitive today.

18:54.008 --> 18:56.719
ANNIE:
Hello?
Yo!

18:56.761 --> 18:57.678
Is Bree here?

18:57.720 --> 18:58.846
Uh, no.

18:58.888 --> 18:59.680
She went back to campus.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.223
(sighs)
Why?

19:01.265 --> 19:02.850
Are you okay? Is...
Can I help?

19:02.892 --> 19:04.560
No.
I just gotta find her.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.441
Oh, my God.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.985
(door shuts)

19:12.026 --> 19:13.235
There are two cops
coming up the walkway.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.528
There's wha...?
(knocking on door)

19:14.570 --> 19:15.488
(indistinct police radio
communication)

19:24.204 --> 19:25.623
Dixon Wilson?
Austin Tallridge?

19:25.665 --> 19:28.084
Um... I'm Dixon.

19:28.126 --> 19:29.961
Austin's not here at the moment.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.378
We have a warrant
to search your house

19:31.420 --> 19:33.255
in connection to
the Kappa sorority house fire.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.091
What?

19:35.133 --> 19:36.843
And you are?

19:36.884 --> 19:38.260
Um, I'm Annie.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.804
He's my brother.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.806
Um, Officers...

19:41.848 --> 19:43.390
what's going on?

19:43.432 --> 19:45.018
An anonymous witness
called our tip line.

19:45.059 --> 19:46.978
Start with the bedrooms.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.896
Why would they think

19:48.938 --> 19:50.523
you have anything to do
with the Kappa fire?

19:52.692 --> 19:53.651
We were there.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.194
What?!

19:55.235 --> 19:57.030
Why?!

19:57.071 --> 19:58.865
Look, we were doing a stupid
prank on Holly, okay?

19:58.906 --> 20:00.324
I swear it was

20:00.366 --> 20:02.827
nothing but eggs and
toilet paper-- that's it.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.955
This lighter fluid was hidden
under a bed, Mr. Wilson.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.623
Is that your bedroom?
Yes.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.959
But I've never seen that
before in my life.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.293
You're under arrest.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.670
You have the right
to remain silent.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.420
Anything you say or do

20:13.462 --> 20:14.672
can and will be held against you

20:14.714 --> 20:15.798
in a court of law.

20:15.840 --> 20:16.883
You have the right
to an attorney.

20:16.924 --> 20:17.675
If you can't afford one...

20:21.137 --> 20:23.848
I thought that phony-ass
cowboy was my friend.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.059
Why would he set me up?

20:26.100 --> 20:27.518
What kind of person does that?

20:27.560 --> 20:28.310
I don't know.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.770
It doesn't sound
like Austin to me.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.438
Well, who else
could it have been?

20:31.480 --> 20:33.066
He didn't want to get in
any kind of trouble

20:33.107 --> 20:34.692
because of me--
he told me so.

20:34.734 --> 20:38.071
So he probably made that
"anonymous" phone call.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.446
No one else knew that
we were there that night.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.323
Well, what about
the lighter fluid?

20:41.365 --> 20:43.534
Bree said that they
suspected arson.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.412
Wait, Bree?

20:46.453 --> 20:47.997
Did Bree know that you guys
were there that night?

20:48.039 --> 20:49.582
I don't know. Um...

20:49.623 --> 20:51.333
Why would she even care?

20:51.375 --> 20:52.877
She cooked us dinner
that night, yeah,

20:52.919 --> 20:55.504
but I was feeling so guilty
that night that I asked her

20:55.546 --> 20:57.339
a bunch of questions
about the fire.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.758
That's when Austin
really got ticked off.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.426
Okay, Dixon, can you
get home by yourself?

21:00.467 --> 21:03.512
They said the bail would be
processed in an hour or so.

21:03.554 --> 21:05.223
Yeah, I could.
Why, where are you going?

21:05.264 --> 21:06.766
There's someone that
I have to talk to.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.647
SILVER:
Adrianna!

21:14.857 --> 21:16.275
She's not here.

21:16.316 --> 21:17.944
Yeah, I can see that.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.738
Dixon's not answering his phone,
I don't know where else to look.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.573
We should've just called
the police when we found out.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.575
I was sure she
wouldn't go far.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.410
I've been wrong about
a lot of things, I guess.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.079
Yeah.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.123
Silver, hey. I'm-I'm sorry.

21:30.164 --> 21:32.125
I shouldn't have told Ade
anything about you and Greg.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.459
It doesn't matter now.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.674
It has been forever since I've
spent any time in this room.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.594
Yeah. Me, too.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.139
There's a lot
of memories.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.514
Yeah.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.349
Even a couple good ones.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.269
Hey, there's a lot
of stuff here.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.186
I mean, I know she saves a lot,

21:52.228 --> 21:52.645
Maybe we could find

21:52.686 --> 21:54.354
a clue to where she is.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.950
I used to know Adrianna so well.

22:05.992 --> 22:09.078
I just wish I knew
what she's thinking now.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.704
No, that doesn't help me at all!

22:10.746 --> 22:12.414
Unbelievable!

22:12.456 --> 22:15.168
The labels are ready, but they
won't be delivering them today.

22:15.209 --> 22:16.127
Something to do with traffic.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.254
Wow. Never saw that coming.

22:18.296 --> 22:19.880
Oh, and they added a fee
for the rush.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.381
It was very nice of them

22:21.423 --> 22:22.883
to give us this information
before we placed the order.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.551
Guys, we're fine.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.263
I mean, you know,
what do we need labels

22:27.305 --> 22:31.267
and VIP lists for
when we have...

22:31.309 --> 22:31.349
these?

22:32.601 --> 22:34.645
What... is that?

22:34.687 --> 22:36.314
I Liam-ized the bar uniform.

22:36.354 --> 22:39.150
This guy gave me a great deal
on, like, a hundred of them.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.484
LIAM:
Okay, that's it!

22:40.526 --> 22:42.111
Naomi, get your car!

22:42.153 --> 22:44.530
We're picking up those labels
and I am taking over this party

22:44.571 --> 22:46.115
before someone cuts me
and I start bleeding money.

22:46.157 --> 22:47.783
I cannot leave right now.

22:47.825 --> 22:49.743
I have to be here to make sure
everything is perfect.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.411
Liam, if this is not
the best party my TA has

22:51.453 --> 22:53.413
ever been to, he'll never let me
out of my Physics project.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.582
Your Physics project is
gonna be slapping labels on

22:55.624 --> 22:57.210
every beer bottle in sight!

22:57.251 --> 22:58.878
I don't know this printer,
you do!

22:58.919 --> 23:00.546
You set up this deal,
I didn't!

23:00.587 --> 23:02.006
And you have a car,
which I do not.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.674
Well... O-Okay!

23:03.716 --> 23:05.051
Oh, my God!

23:08.679 --> 23:10.348
Come here.
Oh, Annie.

23:10.388 --> 23:11.349
We have to talk.

23:11.389 --> 23:12.516
You look upset.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.268
Upset? Yeah,
you could say that.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.103
Please tell me that
you did not frame my brother

23:16.145 --> 23:17.104
for the Kappa fire.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.981
Why would you even think that?

23:19.023 --> 23:21.234
Maybe because the cops are
still investigating

23:21.275 --> 23:22.484
the escorting service,

23:22.526 --> 23:24.111
and they couldn't search
the sorority house

23:24.153 --> 23:25.445
because it went up in flames!

23:25.487 --> 23:27.365
Will you keep
your voice down?!

23:29.700 --> 23:31.409
Do you want us both
to go to jail with Dixon?

23:31.451 --> 23:32.410
So, I'm right--
you were the one

23:32.452 --> 23:33.704
who called and made the tip.

23:33.746 --> 23:34.705
Bree!

23:34.747 --> 23:36.707
No...

23:36.749 --> 23:38.458
Do you want
to know what happened?

23:38.500 --> 23:39.293
Fine.

23:39.335 --> 23:41.795
Look, the cops
wouldn't leave it alone,

23:41.837 --> 23:43.547
so I had to get rid
of my client list.

23:43.589 --> 23:44.340
When everybody was out,

23:44.382 --> 23:46.259
I threw it into the bathtub,
I lit it on fire,

23:46.300 --> 23:47.301
and then I went to meet up
with the Kappas

23:47.343 --> 23:49.929
at the Greeks Against Teenage
Drinking kegger.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.597
And then you framed my brother?!

23:51.638 --> 23:53.057
I'm not a chemistry major, okay?

23:53.099 --> 23:55.142
How was I supposed to know that
the Fire Marshal would be able

23:55.184 --> 23:56.476
to figure out it was arson!

23:56.518 --> 23:58.396
I mean, I don't need them
on my trail for that, too!

23:58.436 --> 24:01.607
Annie, and then I overheard
Dixon and Austin talking

24:01.648 --> 24:04.902
about how they egged the
Kappa house that night.

24:04.944 --> 24:05.819
It was just too perfect.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.613
You heard them because of me.

24:07.654 --> 24:08.864
I made Dixon take you in.

24:08.906 --> 24:10.157
This is all my fault.

24:10.199 --> 24:12.368
No, please don't beat
yourself up about this.

24:12.410 --> 24:16.163
I mean, what is this for Dixon,
a prank gone wrong?

24:16.205 --> 24:17.998
What's he gonna get,
community service?

24:18.040 --> 24:21.377
Me? I'd go to jail
for prostitution

24:21.419 --> 24:26.090
and you would get humiliated
and expelled from CU.

24:26.132 --> 24:29.969
I mean, this is kind of...
win-win.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.931
Look, I can't tell you
what to do...

24:33.973 --> 24:36.183
but it's either you or Dixon.

24:36.225 --> 24:37.643
So think about it.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.781
(horns honking)

24:50.823 --> 24:51.573
(Liam sighs)

24:51.615 --> 24:53.033
Great!

24:53.075 --> 24:54.827
We'll never get back in time
to make this party work.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.579
Why won't these morons
in front of us just drive?!

24:57.621 --> 25:00.540
Green! Green!

25:00.582 --> 25:01.959
What are they,
colorblind?

25:02.001 --> 25:03.043
Go around them.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.420
I can't go around them.

25:04.462 --> 25:07.173
The entire intersection
is blocked, Liam.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.424
I shouldn't have listened
to either one of you.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.050
Oh, you're the one who
wanted us to take back streets

25:10.092 --> 25:11.635
all the way
to Cudahy right now.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.553
Because someone had to get
this party under control.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.097
And clearly,
it wasn't gonna be you.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.682
When was the bar opening
not under control?

25:16.723 --> 25:18.100
Vanessa had some
really great ideas.

25:18.142 --> 25:19.435
Yeah, well, maybe
you should have asked her

25:19.477 --> 25:20.853
for some advice on how
to pass Physics.

25:20.894 --> 25:21.979
(sighs)

25:22.021 --> 25:23.563
Oh, come on, Liam.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.899
Vanessa just thinks you can do
something big with your life.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.277
Trusting someone who believes
in you is not a mistake.

25:28.319 --> 25:29.569
Yeah, well, the only person

25:29.611 --> 25:31.113
I've ever been able
to trust is myself.

25:31.155 --> 25:32.572
Oh, well, then trust yourself.

25:32.614 --> 25:36.869
Well, like you trusted yourself
to pass Physics without help?

25:36.910 --> 25:40.498
Naomi, the only help you ever
got in high school was from Max.

25:40.538 --> 25:43.417
Well, you know what? If Max were
here right now, he'd...

25:43.459 --> 25:48.381
say to stop fooling around
and just do my Physics project.

25:48.422 --> 25:51.258
Then why not do what Max would
tell you to do?

25:51.300 --> 25:52.343
Why not trust Vanessa?

26:04.646 --> 26:05.605
What, did you find something?

26:05.647 --> 26:07.483
Just this.

26:07.525 --> 26:09.360
You guys were
such good friends.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.863
Sometimes it's hard
to believe that's over.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.824
Yeah, well, Adrianna made
a lot of really bad decisions.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.368
That doesn't mean
she's a bad person, Silver.

26:19.328 --> 26:21.497
Forget it. It's not like you're
ever gonna forgive her anyway.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.294
Hey.
Yeah.

26:27.336 --> 26:28.962
It's to Maisy.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.006
What?
It's from 2008.

26:31.048 --> 26:34.009
NAVID:
That's the year Maisy was born.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.303
"Dear Maisy,
You aren't even one day old

26:36.345 --> 26:39.432
"and I love you so much
my heart is breaking.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.850
"You are so tiny, so perfect.

26:41.892 --> 26:44.853
"Soon, your new parents will
come take you to a better life,

26:44.895 --> 26:47.940
"and I need you to understand
why I let you go.

26:47.981 --> 26:51.693
"When you were inside me,
I had two hearts.

26:51.735 --> 26:54.071
"And when I gave you
to your mom and dad,

26:54.113 --> 26:56.740
"I'm trusting them
with one of them.

26:56.782 --> 26:59.617
"They'll be able to give you
everything I can't.

26:59.659 --> 27:02.204
I want my daughter to watch the
sunset in Bayview Park with..."

27:02.246 --> 27:03.289
Uh...

27:03.330 --> 27:05.458
Bayview Park...

27:05.499 --> 27:07.084
Yeah.
It's right around
the corner.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.668
We should go.
No, no, no, no.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.754
I have to do this alone.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.220
(clears throat)

27:18.262 --> 27:19.763
Okay, look, before
you say anything,

27:19.805 --> 27:21.181
let me at least
say this, okay?

27:21.223 --> 27:22.808
I did not know

27:22.849 --> 27:24.268
about you and Nick,
all right?

27:24.310 --> 27:26.395
It is just as awkward
for me as it is for you.

27:26.437 --> 27:27.896
And I do not know why
he put us together,

27:27.938 --> 27:30.023
but obviously he's either being
a total jackass

27:30.065 --> 27:32.067
or you know, maybe...

27:32.109 --> 27:35.613
he actually thinks that
you and I would think

27:35.653 --> 27:37.781
that the work
was more important than him.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.408
Hmm.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.952
Both of those things
are probably true.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.496
Okay, so does that mean

27:43.537 --> 27:45.956
that we can maybe
put aside the jackass option

27:45.998 --> 27:46.999
and actually talk
about my work?

27:47.040 --> 27:47.665
I mean,
don't you think

27:47.707 --> 27:49.126
I deserve an honest opinion?

27:50.586 --> 27:52.254
You want my honest opinion?

27:53.797 --> 27:56.175
Your portfolio's pretty good,
but it's all faces.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.675
I don't do faces.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.971
Nick isn't sleeping
with Annie Liebowitz,

28:01.013 --> 28:03.723
but I wouldn't put
her stuff up either.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.058
Not that you're Annie Liebowitz.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.226
Right.

28:06.268 --> 28:08.270
So, basically,
what you're saying is

28:08.312 --> 28:10.147
that you don't like
my work because

28:10.189 --> 28:11.731
you actually
just don't like my work.

28:13.691 --> 28:15.902
Got it.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.863
Just so you know,

28:17.904 --> 28:21.283
I don't take pictures
because of Nick, okay?

28:21.325 --> 28:23.118
I take pictures
'cause I have to,

28:23.160 --> 28:26.913
and it doesn't matter who likes
them or who likes me.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.505
Wait.

28:34.547 --> 28:38.384
You're not gonna walk
all the way to Beverly Hills.

28:38.425 --> 28:42.680
Traffic's not going anywhere
for hours, so...

28:42.721 --> 28:45.182
you hauled your
entire portfolio down here.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.809
It's your
best work, right?

28:47.851 --> 28:49.645
Might as well look at it.

28:51.813 --> 28:52.565
Really?

28:55.651 --> 28:56.193
Thanks.

29:01.699 --> 29:03.909
You're not gonna
untie these for me?

29:03.950 --> 29:04.951
(chuckles)
Sorry.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.662
Gonna make me
do all the work?

29:06.704 --> 29:07.705
(door opens)

29:09.748 --> 29:10.957
Hey.

29:10.999 --> 29:11.917
What the hell
happened?

29:11.958 --> 29:13.752
I heard Dixon got arrested.

29:13.793 --> 29:14.753
Uh, yeah.

29:14.794 --> 29:16.213
I'm waiting for him.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.006
He's out on bail,
and he's just stuck in traffic.

29:18.048 --> 29:19.966
Well, listen,
I didn't rat him out.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.427
I know I was
pretty hard on him

29:21.468 --> 29:23.262
about not telling what happened,
but that's only because

29:23.303 --> 29:26.390
when I was 14, I was in trouble
for hot-wiring a car,

29:26.432 --> 29:28.392
and was knee-deep in crap
for two years.

29:28.434 --> 29:31.478
Yeah, well, I think this is
a little bit bigger than that.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.313
But don't worry about it.

29:33.355 --> 29:35.982
I know you're not the one
who set Dixon up.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.317
It was Bree.

29:37.359 --> 29:38.902
Bree?

29:38.944 --> 29:40.028
What are you
talking about?

29:40.070 --> 29:42.489
She started the fire
that night.

29:43.449 --> 29:44.866
And then she planted

29:44.908 --> 29:47.286
the can of lighter fluid
in Dixon's bedroom

29:47.327 --> 29:50.706
when she realized that you guys
had been there that night, too.

29:50.748 --> 29:53.417
It's all my fault.

29:53.459 --> 29:56.169
Now I have to go and tell
the police everything.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.463
Well, the cops
are not gonna believe

29:57.504 --> 30:00.424
that Bree set her
own house on fire.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.050
They will when I tell them
that she was running

30:02.092 --> 30:03.218
her own escort service.

30:05.220 --> 30:09.642
Which I know,
because I worked for her.

30:09.683 --> 30:10.309
What?

30:10.350 --> 30:12.185
That's how I paid
for Dixon's rehab.

30:16.189 --> 30:16.189
(sighs)

30:17.899 --> 30:21.194
Okay, but you can't tell
the cops that.

30:21.236 --> 30:24.823
I can't let Dixon get in trouble
for something that he didn't do.

30:24.864 --> 30:27.701
He's my brother.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.454
Listen, you and Dix and all
your friends...

30:30.496 --> 30:33.332
I mean, you guys are all like
brothers and sisters.

30:33.373 --> 30:36.918
Me, I've always just figured,
"Look out for number one."

30:36.960 --> 30:40.172
You got a lot to lose
by telling the truth.

30:40.213 --> 30:43.342
And if Dix finds out,
it'll kill him.

30:43.383 --> 30:47.262
I'm just tired
of not doing the right thing.

30:53.310 --> 30:55.145
♪ ♪

31:12.705 --> 31:14.623
I was going to bring her back.

31:19.252 --> 31:21.129
I know.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.593
After she saw the sunset.

31:28.762 --> 31:30.096
It was in your letter.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.396
I wanted to give it to her
parents to give to Maisy

31:37.437 --> 31:39.690
when she was old enough...

31:39.732 --> 31:41.358
but I couldn't.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.322
Because you did something
you couldn't take back,

31:47.364 --> 31:49.742
and you didn't know if
she would forgive you.

31:49.783 --> 31:51.451
I betrayed her.

31:51.493 --> 31:54.329
That is something that is
with me every day.

31:55.955 --> 31:57.290
I tried so hard to make sure

31:57.332 --> 31:59.000
that she would have
a real family,

31:59.042 --> 32:02.170
one that wasn't
going to fall apart.

32:04.882 --> 32:07.509
Will it help you if I tell you
that Greg is a good father?

32:07.551 --> 32:10.220
And if everything
he says about Leslie...

32:10.262 --> 32:13.807
makes her sound
like a great mother.

32:13.849 --> 32:15.392
You did the right thing, Ade.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.686
You couldn't keep her.

32:19.813 --> 32:21.440
Do you think she'll
ever forgive me?

32:24.443 --> 32:27.780
She will.

32:27.821 --> 32:29.322
I do.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.183
(door opens)

33:00.061 --> 33:01.020
(banging at door)

33:01.062 --> 33:02.481
Yo, Austin, come out.
I know you did it!

33:02.522 --> 33:04.316
Look, Dixon, don't, okay?
It's all my fault.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.318
I need to tell you the truth.
About what?

33:06.359 --> 33:07.945
About how a phony friend
set me up?

33:07.986 --> 33:10.405
Or how he's about
to pay-- in teeth?

33:11.698 --> 33:12.950
Oh, there's
about to be

33:12.991 --> 33:14.660
some frontier-style
justice in here.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.662
How about I turn myself in
to the cops instead?

33:16.703 --> 33:19.331
Nobody is going... What?

33:19.372 --> 33:21.082
You wanted to tell him
the truth.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.709
I started that fire.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.336
After we egged
the Kappa house,

33:24.377 --> 33:26.505
I was still mad at Holly,
so I went back,

33:26.546 --> 33:28.590
snuck in and, uh, took a bunch
of old love letters,

33:28.632 --> 33:29.800
threw them in the tub,

33:29.842 --> 33:31.217
squirted some lighter
fluid on them,

33:31.259 --> 33:34.179
and boom. (chuckles)
Are you serious?

33:34.220 --> 33:36.222
Yeah, I didn't realize
it would catch the curtains.

33:36.264 --> 33:38.517
Bad planning, I guess.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.481
DIXON:
Dude.

33:44.523 --> 33:45.983
That's messed up.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.360
Yeah, that is messed up.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.821
Why are you saying all of this?

33:50.863 --> 33:52.614
'Cause I got nothing to lose.

33:52.656 --> 33:54.282
Unlike some people.

33:56.242 --> 33:58.286
Hell, I didn't want to be
at CU this year anyway.

33:58.328 --> 33:59.621
Let them kick me out.

33:59.663 --> 34:01.039
I'll get a couple
months probation

jailhouse tattoo.

called around

35:13.445 --> 35:14.654
to find a band,
it turns out

35:14.696 --> 35:16.239
they missed their gig
'cause they were stuck

35:16.281 --> 35:17.657
in traffic three blocks away,

36:12.378 --> 36:13.505
I'll add in some
extra credit,

36:13.546 --> 36:15.298
and then you don't
flunk the class.

36:15.340 --> 36:16.925
No.

36:16.967 --> 36:18.510
I would rather do
the project myself.

36:18.551 --> 36:21.179
Grades go in
tomorrow, so you...

36:21.220 --> 36:23.348
you'd have to
do it now, so...

36:23.389 --> 36:25.934
So I will... do it now.

36:25.976 --> 36:30.147
I will illustrate
a case of gravity

36:30.188 --> 36:31.940
providing counterweight.

36:31.982 --> 36:35.652

37:04.931 --> 37:07.142
Oh, me of little faith.

37:07.184 --> 37:08.852
It's fabulous.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.562
"A" for the project--
and then that,

37:10.603 --> 37:11.521
combined with
your poor attendance

37:11.563 --> 37:12.939
and your low test scores,

37:12.981 --> 37:14.774
would give you a "C"
for the class.

37:14.816 --> 37:17.276
And now you can go back
to your double Ds.

37:17.318 --> 37:18.236
(laughing):
Cool.

37:18.277 --> 37:19.821

make it easier for you.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.223
I'm sorry.
(chuckles)

37:46.264 --> 37:49.267
Well, you don't
have to apologize.

37:49.308 --> 37:51.477
Look, you had every reason
to doubt me,

37:51.519 --> 37:54.898
and I'm sorry for the way
that we first met.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.150
Hitting me with a car
was starting with a bang.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.197
You trust me now?

38:02.239 --> 38:03.031
Absolutely.

38:04.824 --> 38:07.077
And I like what
you've done with the bar.

38:07.119 --> 38:08.745
Maybe it actually
can be something.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.329
Oh, yeah.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.207
No, that... really
doesn't interest me.

38:12.249 --> 38:14.500
Wait, then what were we
doing all this for?

38:14.542 --> 38:19.131
Liam, what I was selling tonight
wasn't the Offshore.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.258
It was you.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.594
And, honey, you sold

38:24.636 --> 38:27.180
like ice cream
on a warm summer day.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.848
(chuckling)

38:28.890 --> 38:31.017
Mm...

38:31.059 --> 38:34.646
There is so much more to life
than this bar.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.079
Maisy.

38:51.121 --> 38:52.831
Hi, sweetie.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.707
Hi, Daddy.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.417
I missed you.

38:56.459 --> 38:57.961
Where were you?

38:58.003 --> 38:59.212
Stuck in traffic?

39:00.255 --> 39:02.215
Hi, Greg.

39:04.383 --> 39:07.304
She's beautiful.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.015
Adrianna.

39:11.266 --> 39:12.809
What are you doing here?

39:12.851 --> 39:14.811
I... I just wanted to see
if she was okay.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.147
When I heard that
you and Leslie

39:17.189 --> 39:19.440
were breaking up,
I...
She called me...

39:19.482 --> 39:22.485
because she wanted
to meet Maisy.

39:22.527 --> 39:25.322
Because Adrianna and I
are friends.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.495
And you didn't tell me?

39:32.537 --> 39:33.746
I should have.

39:33.788 --> 39:34.247
I just thought this would be

39:34.289 --> 39:36.582
a good time for Ade
to meet Maisy.

39:36.624 --> 39:37.709
It went really well.

39:39.002 --> 39:40.003
What?!

39:41.838 --> 39:45.008
I... Okay, I don't even
know where to start.

39:46.676 --> 39:48.261
The decision for Maisy
to meet her birth mother

39:48.303 --> 39:50.680
is not for you
or Adrianna to make.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.307
It's for Maisy to make,
and right now,

39:52.349 --> 39:53.766
she's too young
to know what to do.

39:53.808 --> 39:54.351
I know. I'm sorry.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.102
I should... I didn't think.

39:56.144 --> 39:57.478
No, you didn't think.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.897
And you lied to me.

39:58.938 --> 40:01.733
You should've told me
that you knew Adrianna.

40:01.774 --> 40:04.736
I... how do I
trust you with Maisy?

40:04.777 --> 40:06.696
How do I trust you now
with anything?

40:06.738 --> 40:08.948
Greg, this is all my fault.

40:08.990 --> 40:13.036
Okay, Silver is a good person
and a good friend.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.454
You have no idea how good.

40:15.496 --> 40:17.832
Okay, look,
I appreciate your loyalty,

40:17.874 --> 40:19.292
but it's really
none of your business.

40:21.127 --> 40:24.839
I can't have you
in my daughter's life.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.800
Or in mine.

40:31.721 --> 40:34.015
Okay.

40:34.057 --> 40:36.268
I understand.

40:36.309 --> 40:37.518
Enjoy New York.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.108
Hi.

40:44.734 --> 40:47.112
It was really nice
meeting you, Maisy.

40:51.324 --> 40:52.409
All right, sweetie.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.701
Grab your horses.

40:53.743 --> 40:54.911
Good girl.

40:59.207 --> 41:02.501
Thank you for being
such a good father.
