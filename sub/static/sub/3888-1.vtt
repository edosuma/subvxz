00:26.000 --> 00:28.469
That statue has a sad legend.

00:32.707 --> 00:37.880
There once was a
beautiful woman named Datsuko.

00:39.181 --> 00:41.751
She was in love with a man named Taro.

00:42.685 --> 00:46.623
But Datsuko
wanted to be younger and more beautiful.

00:48.692 --> 00:51.596
So she drank a magic potion,

00:51.596 --> 00:56.468
and became the dragon that guards Lake Dajawa.

00:59.104 --> 01:03.107
And just like Datsuko...

01:03.107 --> 01:07.078
Taro became the dragon
that guards Lake Dohwada.

01:09.214 --> 01:15.655
Every winter, they come together at this lake here.

01:21.696 --> 01:25.299
Because of their undying love for each other,

01:25.299 --> 01:29.270
this lake never freezes no matter how cold it gets.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.803
Do you have a religion?

01:58.803 --> 02:00.072
No, sir.

02:02.407 --> 02:05.009
There is a saying...

02:05.009 --> 02:09.281
Live like you believe in a god.

02:10.316 --> 02:12.919
If there is a god,

02:12.919 --> 02:16.189
you will gain infinitely.

02:17.123 --> 02:19.492
Even if there is no god,

02:19.492 --> 02:22.262
you have nothing to lose.

02:22.830 --> 02:23.932
Cheongwadae, Korea Selatan

02:25.298 --> 02:27.301
Hong Seung-ryong.

02:27.301 --> 02:31.005
He's in charge of
North Korea's nuclear arms development.

02:31.005 --> 02:34.110
He asked us for political asylum.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.911
Why would someone like him want an exile?

02:36.911 --> 02:40.884
We should be suspicious of his intentions.

02:47.824 --> 02:49.926
Take it.

02:49.926 --> 02:52.864
You have nothing to lose.

03:00.405 --> 03:02.673
The order just came in.

03:06.210 --> 03:07.679
We'll be escorting you.

03:41.416 --> 03:43.319
Welcome, sir.

03:43.319 --> 03:45.188
Have a safe flight.

04:23.231 --> 04:25.332
What's this?

04:25.332 --> 04:26.533
Gulyas.

04:26.533 --> 04:27.435
Is it good?

04:27.435 --> 04:30.303
Yes, want to try it?

04:37.347 --> 04:41.251
Excuse me? One more Gulyas please.

04:42.017 --> 04:43.118
You want more?

04:43.118 --> 04:44.821
It's for you.

04:44.821 --> 04:48.192
No no no! She was just kidding. No.

04:54.231 --> 04:55.399
Yes?

05:00.337 --> 05:03.140
Hong Seung-ryong is dead.

05:03.140 --> 05:05.677
Our agents are all dead, too.

05:06.512 --> 05:11.084
It appears to be a retaliation from the North.

05:13.119 --> 05:17.057
You have a solo mission.

05:18.326 --> 05:23.097
Your success will have great affect
on reunification of Korea.

05:27.736 --> 05:29.838
Who's the target?

05:29.838 --> 05:31.939
Yoon Sung-chul.

05:31.939 --> 05:35.911
Chairman of the
North's Supreme People's Assembly?

05:36.446 --> 05:37.313
Yes.

05:44.754 --> 05:45.888
Ambulance!

06:05.344 --> 06:06.211
Get him!

06:20.828 --> 06:22.996
What? Keep going.

06:30.238 --> 06:31.705
He's over there.

07:36.146 --> 07:38.815
Where are agents TK1 and TK2?

07:42.153 --> 07:44.021
Please tell me.

07:45.056 --> 07:46.156
Sir!

07:46.156 --> 07:49.124
Return home on the first plane tomorrow.

08:10.650 --> 08:12.852
Mission complete.

08:12.852 --> 08:15.121
I'm at the hideout.

08:17.957 --> 08:21.128
I've been shot, sir.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.264
Requesting for backup.

08:24.264 --> 08:27.034
What are you saying?

08:27.034 --> 08:31.972
You know we can rsk exposure,
if we send in any agents.

08:31.972 --> 08:34.577
But, sir...

08:34.577 --> 08:41.118
I can't escape on my own.

08:43.253 --> 08:45.822
All I can say is...

08:47.058 --> 08:49.626
Follow the protocol.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.863
But sir!

08:52.863 --> 08:55.832
I must return.

08:58.835 --> 08:59.903
Sir!

09:01.839 --> 09:03.207
Sir!

09:14.254 --> 09:18.525
NSS (National Securty Service), South Korea

09:22.063 --> 09:24.665
Lim and Ahn are in Ukraine, rght?
Yes, sir.

09:24.665 --> 09:29.870
Send them to Budapest to report
on police and military actions.

09:29.870 --> 09:30.838
Yes, sir.

09:39.782 --> 09:41.150
You called, sir?

09:43.253 --> 09:46.825
TK1 has been injured on a mission.

09:47.357 --> 09:49.326
It will get ugly if he gets caught.

09:50.461 --> 09:53.263
Our director is here in Balaton, Hungary.

09:53.263 --> 09:56.166
Track his calls for me.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.768
But Seung-hee...

09:57.768 --> 10:01.740
If TK1 is on the list, locate him for me.

10:26.967 --> 10:28.535
Come back safe.

10:29.871 --> 10:32.273
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

10:32.273 --> 10:33.642
Hyun-jun.

10:43.987 --> 10:47.925
Military industry companies
could have killed Kennedy.

11:04.076 --> 11:06.345
At the classroom...

11:14.252 --> 11:16.689
Let's go for some tea.

11:16.689 --> 11:20.626
I don't like hanging around and drinking tea.

11:26.567 --> 11:28.235
But I like beer.

11:31.774 --> 11:32.942
Welcome by me!

12:04.176 --> 12:07.045
The room was rented by an unidentified person.

12:07.579 --> 12:10.250
He's the only one inside the building.

12:11.583 --> 12:12.986
Secured a way in?

12:12.986 --> 12:13.887
Yes, sir.

12:13.887 --> 12:14.754
Move in.

13:26.767 --> 13:29.303
Things aren't good.

13:29.303 --> 13:32.174
Let's get out of here first.

13:37.512 --> 13:42.352
We can use the airfield
we used for Hong Seung-ryong.

14:01.073 --> 14:02.440
Sa-woo...

14:04.009 --> 14:05.377
I'm sorry.

14:07.613 --> 14:09.881
It's an order.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.057
Why...

14:19.292 --> 14:21.961
How could you...

14:22.895 --> 14:25.699
When did you get so close to Hyun-jun?

14:25.699 --> 14:28.104
Perhaps from the start.

14:28.104 --> 14:31.106
The night we all went to the director's house...

14:31.106 --> 14:32.540
That's when we first kissed.

14:38.013 --> 14:39.714
Where did you go for vacation?

14:39.714 --> 14:40.915
Japan.

14:40.915 --> 14:42.817
Who did you go with?

14:42.817 --> 14:43.485
Seung-hee.

15:05.377 --> 15:07.246
Hyun-jun!

15:10.114 --> 15:11.917
What's with you man.

15:11.917 --> 15:14.854
I found the perfect woman.

15:16.222 --> 15:17.490
She's amazing, man.

15:26.201 --> 15:27.569
I'm sorry.

16:25.932 --> 16:27.769
We found him.

16:28.904 --> 16:29.871
Move out!

19:58.537 --> 20:01.006
NSS, South Korea

20:06.512 --> 20:07.681
What's going on?

20:10.550 --> 20:13.351
We're confiscating agent
Kim Hyun-jun's belongings.

20:13.351 --> 20:15.254
Confiscating?

20:15.254 --> 20:16.255
Forwhat reason?

20:16.255 --> 20:18.625
For espionage.

20:37.245 --> 20:38.681
It's me.

20:44.353 --> 20:47.389
Why did you discard me?

20:49.059 --> 20:52.997
What should I say foryou to accept it.

20:54.164 --> 20:56.834
I'll be back, no matter what.

20:57.435 --> 20:59.004
And when I do...

21:00.639 --> 21:04.610
You will pay for playing with my life.

22:11.551 --> 22:15.522
They said Yoon
died due to internal discord in the North.

22:16.356 --> 22:18.025
No, I killed him.

22:20.228 --> 22:23.098
I was ordered to do so.

22:24.165 --> 22:26.099
And succeeded.

22:29.870 --> 22:32.240
But then they cast me out.

22:33.674 --> 22:36.043
Everything is a setup.

22:36.878 --> 22:38.513
It can't be.

22:39.448 --> 22:44.819
To prove that the South
has nothing to do with Yoon's death.

22:46.554 --> 22:48.925
I must not exist.

22:52.630 --> 22:54.698
It's dangerous to be with me.

22:55.332 --> 23:00.304
For Sa-woo, and you.

23:02.274 --> 23:07.444
Even if it's true, I won't leave you.

23:10.283 --> 23:12.118
Even if it means death.

23:14.253 --> 23:16.924
Can't live without you.

24:04.576 --> 24:05.777
I'll get the train tickets.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.513
Stay here.

24:10.382 --> 24:11.417
I'll be quick.

25:23.397 --> 25:24.564
Hello?

30:31.539 --> 30:34.276
Pyungyang, North Korea

30:43.487 --> 30:47.456
Life's unfair, isn't it?

30:48.324 --> 30:52.261
It's not like comrade Yoon died because of you.

30:53.330 --> 30:56.834
But someone has to take the blame.

30:56.834 --> 30:59.337
Isn't that right?

30:59.337 --> 31:03.975
I will take full responsibility
for failing to protect him.

31:05.810 --> 31:07.580
Cut the crap and sit down.

31:12.785 --> 31:15.087
Nothing gets out of this room.

31:15.087 --> 31:17.859
It may not be good foryour career,

31:19.727 --> 31:25.900
but Yoon's death is a gain for me.

31:33.440 --> 31:38.414
Now, I have the rights to nuclear development.

31:40.817 --> 31:44.787
You know what
nuclear arms mean for our nation now.

31:45.787 --> 31:51.262
It's a falling nation's last prde against the world.

31:53.229 --> 31:57.167
When it's hard to predict the future,

31:57.635 --> 32:00.839
you have to gamble a bit.

32:00.839 --> 32:05.510
I trust you feel the same.

32:06.243 --> 32:13.786
That's why I'm planning to reinstate you.

32:15.222 --> 32:17.090
What do I have to do?

32:19.294 --> 32:21.596
No rush.

32:21.596 --> 32:24.164
Let's think it over.

32:30.139 --> 32:34.309
NSS, Classified Documents Area, South Korea

32:55.097 --> 32:58.568
I took care of everything as you ordered.

32:59.135 --> 33:04.975
Guess you're getting used to working with me now.

33:28.503 --> 33:29.870
Seung-hee?

33:37.146 --> 33:40.416
Now, you won't even take my calls?

33:44.054 --> 33:49.026
Hungary intelligence
sent their report on the plane crash.

33:50.359 --> 33:54.598
Autopsy record matches Hyun-jun's data.

33:56.632 --> 34:02.073
See for yourself.

35:14.754 --> 35:16.622
Japanese Martime Self Defence Force

35:17.658 --> 35:19.358
Sir!

35:19.358 --> 35:20.960
What is it?

35:20.960 --> 35:24.364
These are satellite images taken 4 minutes ago.

35:24.364 --> 35:26.967
3 North Korean vehicles
have crossed the Demarcation Line,

35:26.967 --> 35:28.669
heading for South Korea.

35:28.669 --> 35:31.038
U.S. 7th Fleet

35:31.773 --> 35:34.143
The South Korean government
seems to be undergoing

35:34.143 --> 35:36.312
secret movement with the North Koreans.

35:36.845 --> 35:38.615
None of the allies or the surrounding countres

35:38.615 --> 35:40.583
including the U.S. have been informed.

35:53.263 --> 35:56.133
Independence Hall, South Korea

36:12.217 --> 36:15.421
Please proceed rght to the point.

36:15.421 --> 36:20.326
I'd like to meet your leader
directly to discuss reunification.

36:21.461 --> 36:23.497
Could you arrange it?

36:24.865 --> 36:27.801
Pyung Yang, North Korea

36:33.075 --> 36:35.444
Come in.

36:39.483 --> 36:40.850
You called, sir?

36:43.453 --> 36:46.123
Our leader is considerng

36:46.123 --> 36:50.094
to accept the South Korean President's proposal.

36:51.061 --> 36:53.565
I want your opinion on it.

36:53.565 --> 36:55.867
If there is a summit now,

36:55.867 --> 36:58.670
things will go in the South's favor.

36:58.670 --> 37:02.641
Which will weaken our leader's position.

37:03.776 --> 37:05.744
It must be stopped.

37:06.178 --> 37:07.446
How?

37:08.881 --> 37:10.249
With what?

37:18.058 --> 37:21.995
Do you still control that unit overseas?

37:23.529 --> 37:24.598
Yes, sir.

37:26.366 --> 37:29.736
I'll do my best to stop it.

37:31.974 --> 37:34.141
Budapest, Hungary

38:15.087 --> 38:17.790
I heard you recovered.

38:17.790 --> 38:20.459
What a relief.

38:20.993 --> 38:23.063
Who are you?

38:23.063 --> 38:25.298
The one who saved your life.

38:28.535 --> 38:32.942
You didn't stumble into this conspiracy by chance.

38:33.777 --> 38:39.048
You were chosen by those
who stand to gain by this incident.

38:39.782 --> 38:43.787
Are you saying you know who they are?

38:43.787 --> 38:45.688
Iris.

38:45.688 --> 38:53.464
Iris is a secret organization long in existence.

38:54.299 --> 38:59.237
It gains immensely from the conflict
and expansion of armaments.

38:59.237 --> 39:05.078
It's members are in governments
and armies in both North and South.

39:05.078 --> 39:06.613
Who are you?

39:08.281 --> 39:12.551
I spent my entire life trying to unveil those forces.

39:13.586 --> 39:17.557
And created the list of lris members,

39:18.591 --> 39:22.562
which was in Hong Seung-ryong's care.

39:26.599 --> 39:28.101
Akita, Japan

39:28.101 --> 39:33.208
You received something from him
before he died, didn't you?

39:33.742 --> 39:35.844
It was meant for me.

39:35.844 --> 39:38.113
Please hand it over.

39:39.681 --> 39:43.619
Then I will help you get your revenge.

40:59.605 --> 41:01.706
There's something you must do first.

41:01.706 --> 41:04.477
To get your revenge, you'll have to help me.

41:06.012 --> 41:07.814
Watanabe.

41:07.814 --> 41:11.752
He's an lrs member
who's been helping your NSS director, Baek San.

41:12.051 --> 41:14.021
Eliminate him.

41:20.494 --> 41:23.897
Wasn't that a great performance, sir?

41:23.897 --> 41:24.898
Sir?

41:24.898 --> 41:26.567
He's been shot dead!

41:31.306 --> 41:32.874
Sir!

41:47.756 --> 41:50.427
Pyung Yang, North Korea

42:13.219 --> 42:16.723
It was taken
when he crossed the Hungarian border.

42:16.723 --> 42:19.960
It's your last chance to live.

42:19.960 --> 42:21.528
He's in Japan now.

42:23.364 --> 42:24.631
Go get him.

42:35.210 --> 42:36.779
What did Park Chul-young say?

42:38.314 --> 42:40.617
To go and find Kim Hyun-jun.

42:40.617 --> 42:42.519
And?

42:42.519 --> 42:45.221
To bring him back.

42:45.221 --> 42:46.390
What else?

42:48.225 --> 42:51.794
That was all, sir.

43:00.205 --> 43:04.143
You think Park Chul-young
is the one who saved you?

43:07.813 --> 43:11.785
You think he has that kind of power?

43:17.724 --> 43:19.192
Listen closely.

43:21.528 --> 43:26.266
I'll tell you what your real mission is.

43:30.171 --> 43:32.240
Seoul, South Korea

43:37.512 --> 43:41.451
This man's been fighting against us
for the last 30 years.

43:42.518 --> 43:45.122
His name is Yoo Jung-hoon.

43:45.122 --> 43:48.124
We call him the Doctor.

43:48.124 --> 43:51.328
He was one of the nuclear physicists

43:51.328 --> 43:53.330
secretly working on its development.

43:53.330 --> 43:58.502
We tred to get rd of him many times, but failed.

43:59.403 --> 44:05.043
But we just got word
that the Doctor is back in Korea.

44:14.820 --> 44:16.422
My guardian angel!

44:16.422 --> 44:19.025
Where have you been?

44:19.025 --> 44:20.627
I waited so long.

44:20.627 --> 44:21.995
Let's go in.

44:35.377 --> 44:37.446
"Jin Sa-woo"

44:39.415 --> 44:41.917
Hyun-jun is alive.

44:41.917 --> 44:45.188
I think Hyun-jun is behind Watanabe's death.

44:50.627 --> 44:51.795
Take a look.

44:59.037 --> 45:01.007
Yes, sir!

45:03.543 --> 45:04.543
Yeah.

45:04.543 --> 45:07.012
Kim Hyun-jun is alive.

45:07.012 --> 45:10.249
Take him out and brng me the USB drve.

45:10.782 --> 45:14.053
Oga Port, Japan

45:45.321 --> 45:47.189
Hello?

45:48.926 --> 45:50.293
Yuki?

45:51.027 --> 45:54.966
I'm so scared.

46:00.338 --> 46:03.108
Yuki? What's wrong?

46:10.049 --> 46:11.417
Who are you?

46:12.216 --> 46:16.155
Bring me what I want and she will be safe.

46:17.489 --> 46:21.460
Meet me in an hour at Tamagawa Dam.

46:22.629 --> 46:26.167
What do you want from me?

46:27.135 --> 46:31.106
The USB drive Hong Seung-ryong gave you.

47:51.362 --> 47:52.396
Stop there.

47:54.931 --> 47:56.400
Brother...

47:56.400 --> 47:58.002
Are you okay, Yuki?

47:58.002 --> 48:00.671
Don't be scared. It's okay.

48:02.741 --> 48:04.609
Drop the gun.

48:09.047 --> 48:10.049
USB drive.

48:10.049 --> 48:11.517
Let the kid go.

48:44.354 --> 48:45.954
Password.

48:45.954 --> 48:48.324
SH0615.

49:22.564 --> 49:24.032
Duck down.

50:16.657 --> 50:17.790
Yuki.

50:20.662 --> 50:22.329
Mom...

52:01.172 --> 52:03.141
It's me.

52:03.875 --> 52:07.845
North Korean secret service agent
Kim Sun-hwa is trailing you.

52:08.880 --> 52:11.283
Meet Park Chul-young through her.

52:11.283 --> 52:15.253
That's your next step for revenge.

52:44.587 --> 52:47.558
Shanghai, China

53:20.193 --> 53:21.763
Have a seat, sir.

53:48.191 --> 53:49.994
Why did you seek Park Chul-young?

53:49.994 --> 53:52.163
To get help for my revenge.

53:52.897 --> 53:55.498
Who's your target?

53:55.498 --> 53:56.801
Baek San.

53:56.801 --> 53:58.569
Director of NSS.

53:59.570 --> 54:05.444
And South Korea for deserting me.

54:06.411 --> 54:08.512
Busan, South Korea

54:14.787 --> 54:16.088
Ready?

54:16.088 --> 54:17.190
Yes, sir.

54:17.190 --> 54:18.358
We're going in.

54:19.492 --> 54:22.061
Go to Seoul with my men.

54:22.997 --> 54:25.599
Leave Baek San up to me.

54:25.599 --> 54:28.569
You just follow Kang Do-chul's orders.

54:35.877 --> 54:37.045
Sir!

54:38.480 --> 54:39.914
It's a code red.

54:39.914 --> 54:41.617
To the meeting room, please.

54:46.089 --> 54:48.659
A large scaled terrorst attack is expected.

54:50.594 --> 54:54.098
We still don't know the exact time or target.

54:54.098 --> 54:58.069
You two contact foreign services
and get more information...

54:59.003 --> 55:02.974
An ocean liner reported
it had been seized by an armed group.

55:15.388 --> 55:19.326
Our Leader has accepted South Korea's proposal.

55:21.094 --> 55:23.596
There will be a summit soon.

55:23.596 --> 55:25.566
We don't have much time.

55:28.703 --> 55:31.706
Are your men on the job?

55:31.706 --> 55:34.109
Everything's underway.

55:34.109 --> 55:35.811
Don't worry, sir.

55:35.811 --> 55:41.049
I heard a team
will go south to inspect securty measures.

55:41.583 --> 55:45.155
Put me on that team, sir.

56:05.910 --> 56:07.913
Take a look at this.

56:07.913 --> 56:11.117
Whoa! A cross-shaped USB!

56:11.117 --> 56:13.687
There's a folder with some kind of code.

56:13.687 --> 56:15.856
It's a 4KB securty code.

56:27.902 --> 56:32.572
I can't hack it here.

56:34.108 --> 56:36.611
Maybe at the US Pentagon.

56:36.611 --> 56:40.581
Or maybe the NSS network.

56:41.417 --> 56:43.485
What is it anyway?

56:53.830 --> 56:56.100
Enrched uranium is ready now, sir.

56:56.100 --> 56:57.802
Longer than I thought.

56:57.802 --> 56:59.104
You can open it.

56:59.104 --> 57:01.139
It's completely sealed.

57:06.712 --> 57:10.683
Even the Geiger counter won't detect it, sir.

57:11.517 --> 57:15.189
There won't be any problems taking it down south.

57:27.035 --> 57:28.670
Our target is...

57:30.305 --> 57:33.708
South Korea's National Security Service.

57:33.708 --> 57:36.311
The NSS.

57:36.311 --> 57:38.713
But how?

57:38.713 --> 57:41.618
We don't have enough man power.

57:41.618 --> 57:44.687
They think our target is the conference center.

57:45.722 --> 57:47.524
East Asia Diplomat Conference.

57:47.524 --> 57:50.028
And send all their forces there.

57:50.028 --> 57:50.927
Yes?

57:50.927 --> 57:52.797
We found out the terrorsts target.

57:52.797 --> 57:57.068
It's the conference
where the U.S. Secretary of State is attending.

57:57.603 --> 57:59.737
That's their target.

57:59.737 --> 58:03.306
Send in all available units to that location.

58:03.306 --> 58:04.609
Yes, sir.

58:04.609 --> 58:10.984
Also, a team will come from North
to inspect security for the summit.

58:11.617 --> 58:15.321
They'll send forces there, too.

58:15.321 --> 58:19.826
So NSS will have basically no combat forces.

58:19.826 --> 58:22.296
We're crossing into their territory, sir.

58:49.926 --> 58:51.295
It's me.

58:52.329 --> 58:55.532
Yun-jun says he's on our side,

58:55.532 --> 58:57.935
but it's still early to tell.

58:57.935 --> 58:58.535
Yes.

58:58.535 --> 59:02.273
Stay at his side and watch him closely.

59:03.908 --> 59:05.477
Yes, sir.

01:00:19.826 --> 01:00:20.493
All clear.

01:00:26.233 --> 01:00:28.102
Good day, sir.

01:00:33.842 --> 01:00:35.810
What's going on?

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.289
Send me the VlP list for the conference today.

01:00:55.232 --> 01:00:56.234
What is it?

01:00:56.234 --> 01:00:58.302
A fire alarm went off at the main entrance.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.009
What's that?

01:01:08.148 --> 01:01:09.248
Darn it!

01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:11.150
Ring the alarm and report to the control room!

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:12.419
Yes, sir!

01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:14.487
Cut communication.

01:01:17.524 --> 01:01:18.893
Control room?

01:01:22.362 --> 01:01:24.064
The transmission got cut! Send it again!

01:01:24.064 --> 01:01:27.201
Control room! There's no signal.

01:01:28.035 --> 01:01:30.237
The alarm isn't working!

01:01:30.237 --> 01:01:32.139
Control room! Come in!

01:01:32.139 --> 01:01:33.008
Control room!

01:01:47.225 --> 01:01:50.195
Put up the CCTV images on the main screen.

01:01:58.269 --> 01:01:59.772
What's happening?

01:02:57.134 --> 01:02:58.436
JlN Sa-woo speaking.

01:02:58.436 --> 01:02:59.671
It's me.

01:02:59.671 --> 01:03:02.207
NSS is under attack!

01:03:05.278 --> 01:03:07.246
You two stand guard here.

01:03:07.246 --> 01:03:08.648
It's a code black!

01:03:08.648 --> 01:03:10.149
We're going back to NSS.

01:03:10.149 --> 01:03:11.617
Yes, sir.

01:03:39.683 --> 01:03:41.317
Run, sir!

01:05:13.186 --> 01:05:14.221
There it is.

01:05:55.466 --> 01:05:58.469
The data on the USB that couldn't be decrypted

01:05:58.469 --> 01:06:02.040
will be accessible
through Baek San's NSS network.

01:06:02.874 --> 01:06:07.948
The data will unveil my life-long pursuit, lris.

01:06:11.985 --> 01:06:13.854
All entrances are shut down!

01:06:13.854 --> 01:06:14.822
Blow it up, now!

01:06:35.176 --> 01:06:36.644
Freeze!

01:06:38.581 --> 01:06:39.948
Turn around!

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:52.429
Drop the gun.

01:06:53.896 --> 01:06:55.332
Drop it!

01:07:02.708 --> 01:07:03.975
Stop!

01:07:03.975 --> 01:07:05.244
Drop the gun!

01:07:15.488 --> 01:07:17.058
Drop it, now!

01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:48.858
Freeze!

01:08:09.014 --> 01:08:10.550
Blasting!

01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:49.658
Cut!

01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:19.993
Freeze.

01:09:19.993 --> 01:09:21.962
Drop the gun.

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:40.917
What's got into him?

01:09:40.917 --> 01:09:41.817
Why?

01:09:41.817 --> 01:09:44.856
He's acting strange since we got back from NSS.

01:09:54.499 --> 01:10:01.073
Hyun-jun must have been through my secret files.

01:10:02.007 --> 01:10:06.078
That includes the deaths of his parents,

01:10:06.078 --> 01:10:08.747
and the fact that I'm an lrs.

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.156
Can we meet?

01:10:17.022 --> 01:10:19.293
I'll come to you.

01:10:30.906 --> 01:10:33.809
Your parents and I worked on

01:10:33.809 --> 01:10:37.779
a nuclear development project in
Park Jung-hee administration.

01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:42.952
First it was just me on the project.

01:10:44.287 --> 01:10:50.593
But I needed your parents help to complete it.

01:10:51.127 --> 01:10:55.566
Then...it all started.

01:10:56.235 --> 01:10:58.336
After President Park was assassinated,

01:10:58.336 --> 01:11:04.876
the key members on the project
were killed by mysterous accidents.

01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:09.748
Your parents were sacrificed as such.

01:11:11.015 --> 01:11:14.954
While, I barely survived and escaped the country.

01:11:15.788 --> 01:11:22.061
I dedicated my entire life
trying to unveil the conspiracy.

01:11:27.035 --> 01:11:29.637
And I now have the lrs list.

01:11:29.637 --> 01:11:33.776
Can't we just catch Baek San
and all the lrs members?

01:11:34.309 --> 01:11:37.881
But, the list is incomplete.

01:11:38.614 --> 01:11:44.487
Remember I told you
Baek San is not the top of the chain?

01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:49.593
What should I do now?

01:11:49.593 --> 01:11:58.171
You know what the terrorists took from NSS?

01:11:58.738 --> 01:11:59.839
No.

01:11:59.839 --> 01:12:07.480
It's an ultra precision
remote detonator for nuclear bombs.

01:12:09.215 --> 01:12:13.185
Iris is planning a terrorist attack in Seoul.

01:12:16.722 --> 01:12:20.661
I couldn't find any clues
for identification on the bodies.

01:12:21.294 --> 01:12:23.496
Not even a scar.

01:12:23.496 --> 01:12:25.100
What about fingerprnts?

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.367
Nothing.

01:12:27.435 --> 01:12:28.738
What?

01:12:28.738 --> 01:12:31.140
Their didn't have any fingerprints.

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:33.641
We cross examined
all their genetic and teeth records

01:12:33.641 --> 01:12:37.146
and even compared them with foreign records.

01:12:37.146 --> 01:12:39.548
But found no matches.

01:12:39.548 --> 01:12:42.718
But I found a certain type of silicate

01:12:42.718 --> 01:12:44.820
on all their clothes and shoes.

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:48.190
I thought it was peculiar so I analyzed it.

01:12:50.127 --> 01:12:52.461
It was Actinolite.

01:12:55.299 --> 01:12:57.402
Common English, please!

01:12:57.402 --> 01:12:59.405
It's asbestos.

01:12:59.405 --> 01:13:04.442
But that can be found in any factory around.

01:13:04.442 --> 01:13:06.145
Not exactly.

01:13:06.145 --> 01:13:09.549
Actinolite is not a common type of asbestos.

01:13:09.549 --> 01:13:13.553
And it's been banned
since 2003 because it's a carcinogen.

01:13:13.553 --> 01:13:16.723
To prepare an attack like that
with that many people

01:13:16.723 --> 01:13:21.094
they probably needed a big place to hide.

01:13:21.527 --> 01:13:25.766
The place has to have stored
or produced Actinolite.

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:28.602
So it has to be a factory or a warehouse.

01:13:28.602 --> 01:13:31.605
They diverted our attention,

01:13:31.605 --> 01:13:34.843
then attack NSS in that short time.

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:37.479
So it can't be far from here.

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:44.353
Sierra 1, clear!

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:45.754
Sierra 2, clear!

01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:46.956
Sierra 3, clear!

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:48.157
Unit 1, standby!

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:49.392
Units 2 and 3 move in!

01:14:08.849 --> 01:14:12.752
They must not be found.

01:14:12.752 --> 01:14:16.188
Divert the search team.

01:15:03.942 --> 01:15:04.010
Seoul, South Korea

01:15:12.017 --> 01:15:15.855
Summit preparations will take place here.

01:15:15.855 --> 01:15:16.956
People from South?

01:15:16.956 --> 01:15:20.894
Cheongwadae workers will setup camp downstairs.

01:15:25.266 --> 01:15:26.969
Sir, we're ready to cancel
the summit by mentioning the bomb now.

01:15:26.969 --> 01:15:30.906
Sir, we're ready to cancel
the summit by mentioning the bomb now.

01:15:31.739 --> 01:15:34.143
No need.

01:15:34.143 --> 01:15:39.180
That nuclear bomb...must explode in Seoul.

01:15:43.719 --> 01:15:47.957
It will be remembered as an heroic act.

01:15:47.957 --> 01:15:51.896
Are you planning to start a war?

01:15:53.063 --> 01:15:54.232
Yes.

01:15:57.569 --> 01:16:01.774
Our mission is to stop the lnter Korean summit.

01:16:01.774 --> 01:16:03.007
How?

01:16:03.842 --> 01:16:07.781
We will detonate a nuclear bomb in Seoul.

01:16:08.747 --> 01:16:11.250
Where is the bomb now?

01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:13.085
That's classified.

01:16:15.723 --> 01:16:18.825
Why are you keeping her alive?

01:16:18.825 --> 01:16:24.466
She's a NSS executive. Choi Seung-hee.

01:16:24.466 --> 01:16:26.369
She has access to top secret codes.

01:16:26.369 --> 01:16:30.172
If we obtain the securty codes,
it'll make things easier.

01:16:30.172 --> 01:16:32.375
Let me find out.

01:16:32.375 --> 01:16:34.243
Kim Hyun-jun.

01:16:35.278 --> 01:16:36.914
You do it.

01:16:37.647 --> 01:16:40.850
You were a NSS agent.

01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:46.189
You should know how to make her talk.

01:16:58.469 --> 01:17:01.004
I was a former NSS agent.

01:17:02.974 --> 01:17:08.746
I know the protocol very well.

01:17:09.982 --> 01:17:14.520
You'll talk eventually, so let's not drag this.

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:22.596
We need your Level 1 securty code.

01:17:24.132 --> 01:17:26.434
Then, you would know

01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:32.340
that the code is deleted the minute I went missing.

01:17:32.874 --> 01:17:34.910
I'll be the judge of that.

01:17:40.383 --> 01:17:43.218
Tell me the code.

01:17:56.634 --> 01:17:57.535
It's me.

01:17:57.535 --> 01:17:58.637
Yes.

01:17:58.637 --> 01:18:00.572
Is the nuclear bomb being fused?

01:18:00.572 --> 01:18:05.343
Right on schedule
and all being recorded as ordered.

01:18:05.343 --> 01:18:06.778
Stop the fusion.

01:18:06.778 --> 01:18:07.579
Pardon?

01:18:07.579 --> 01:18:10.583
Send the recorded contents
to NSS and Cheongwadae.

01:18:10.583 --> 01:18:13.485
And demand to cease the summit.

01:18:13.485 --> 01:18:15.888
That'll be enough to press the South.

01:18:15.888 --> 01:18:16.989
Stop now.

01:18:16.989 --> 01:18:18.425
I can't, sir.

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:21.463
What did you just say?

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:24.465
I said, I can't follow your order, sir.

01:18:24.465 --> 01:18:29.939
I was told to build the bomb and set it off in Seoul.

01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:32.141
I didn't give you such order.

01:18:32.141 --> 01:18:37.046
Commissioner Yeon Ki-hoon
has command to this operation.

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:39.916
I'm sorry, sir.

01:18:48.793 --> 01:18:52.464
If you keep stalling, I'll have to torture you.

01:18:52.464 --> 01:18:58.335
If you were a NSS agent,
why did you become a terrorist?

01:19:01.138 --> 01:19:05.609
Why have you betrayed the NSS and your country?

01:19:07.979 --> 01:19:10.115
And your colleagues?

01:19:13.585 --> 01:19:18.192
No reason can justify your betrayal.

01:19:18.192 --> 01:19:20.561
Shut up and answer.

01:19:40.883 --> 01:19:42.517
What's the securty code?

01:19:59.471 --> 01:20:01.039
Say it.

01:20:02.974 --> 01:20:04.243
Say it!

01:20:41.150 --> 01:20:43.720
The current events in South.

01:20:45.054 --> 01:20:47.425
Is it your doing, Commissioner Yeon?

01:20:49.693 --> 01:20:50.695
Yes.

01:20:50.695 --> 01:20:55.700
Will you really blow up a nuclear bomb in Seoul?

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:59.638
Can't oppose orders from higher authorties.

01:21:00.204 --> 01:21:04.209
I couldn't notify you in advance of the NSS attack,

01:21:04.209 --> 01:21:07.180
due to security measures.

01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:09.347
How far along is it?

01:21:18.358 --> 01:21:19.826
More!

01:21:32.606 --> 01:21:34.676
Darn witch!

01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:37.278
Let her go.

01:22:16.391 --> 01:22:18.159
Just like you had worried.

01:22:21.162 --> 01:22:23.130
I became a monster.

01:22:29.704 --> 01:22:32.640
And I can't go back.

01:22:40.416 --> 01:22:48.358
Erase me...from your memory.

01:24:23.532 --> 01:24:25.232
Dispose everything.

01:24:25.232 --> 01:24:26.401
Yes, sir.

01:24:37.278 --> 01:24:42.953
Though you have aged,
you're as atrocious as ever.

01:24:44.021 --> 01:24:47.691
That's what brought me to where I am now.

01:24:55.032 --> 01:24:57.401
All done, sir.

01:25:11.184 --> 01:25:15.122
Don't think this is over.

01:25:16.421 --> 01:25:20.961
I'm not the one who will end this anyway.

01:25:21.929 --> 01:25:25.534
Haven't you realized by now?

01:25:25.534 --> 01:25:34.509
No nation or individual survives against lrs.

01:25:35.444 --> 01:25:42.252
If you're considering Hyun-jun,
you'll be disappointed.

01:25:43.587 --> 01:25:48.024
He's only alive because we need him to be.

01:25:48.624 --> 01:25:52.563
I could kill him any time.

01:25:55.032 --> 01:26:00.704
"Whoso sheddeth man's blood,
by man shall his blood be shed."

01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:06.212
Genesis chapter 9, verse 6.

01:26:58.435 --> 01:27:00.971
They're already gone.

01:27:22.296 --> 01:27:25.899
Any last words?

01:27:25.899 --> 01:27:31.705
"Whoso sheddeth man's blood,
by man shall his blood be shed."

01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:40.417
Genesis chapter 9, verse 6.

01:28:52.964 --> 01:28:55.732
There is an organization called lrs.

01:28:56.668 --> 01:28:59.871
And another group against it.

01:29:00.806 --> 01:29:05.244
Iris has influence over both South and North.

01:29:06.712 --> 01:29:10.650
And the NSS Director Baek San
is also receiving orders from them?

01:29:11.751 --> 01:29:13.854
Is that correct?

01:29:13.854 --> 01:29:16.355
Yes, Mr.President.

01:29:16.355 --> 01:29:19.793
It's not easy for me to accept.

01:29:22.461 --> 01:29:23.930
Have a look, sir.

01:29:38.313 --> 01:29:42.051
When I can't even trust the Director of NSS,

01:29:42.051 --> 01:29:45.355
How can we stop a nuclear terror?

01:29:45.355 --> 01:29:49.660
I'm with those terrorists at the moment, sir.

01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:52.463
They don't know where I stand.

01:29:52.463 --> 01:29:56.333
Perhaps I can get to that bomb, sir.

01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:03.074
Are you planning to start a war, sir?

01:30:03.074 --> 01:30:05.644
The bomb must explode in Seoul.

01:30:05.644 --> 01:30:09.716
Our people will have to suffer
more than they do now.

01:30:09.716 --> 01:30:15.489
There will be sacrifices.

01:30:16.455 --> 01:30:19.592
I plan to build a younger and stronger republic.

01:30:21.761 --> 01:30:23.697
Through this war.

01:30:56.969 --> 01:30:58.469
Ma'am?

01:30:58.469 --> 01:30:59.170
What?

01:30:59.170 --> 01:31:01.340
We found a place with radiation releases.

01:31:26.367 --> 01:31:29.302
They must have fused the bomb here.

01:32:26.133 --> 01:32:27.402
I don't know...

01:32:31.972 --> 01:32:33.475
Where to start.

01:32:35.777 --> 01:32:38.146
Or what to say.

01:32:42.484 --> 01:32:44.454
Hold me.

01:34:25.498 --> 01:34:30.872
I saw the car explode outside Budapest Station.

01:34:31.706 --> 01:34:33.943
I thought you were dead.

01:34:34.577 --> 01:34:37.747
Sa-woo called and I got out.

01:34:37.747 --> 01:34:41.685
Then the North Korean agents swarmed in.

01:34:45.688 --> 01:34:49.625
It wasn't the government
that ordered me to kill Yoon Sung-chul.

01:34:50.092 --> 01:34:53.263
It was lrs, an organization Baek San belongs to.

01:34:54.699 --> 01:34:59.870
As well as Sa-woo who tred to kill me.

01:35:01.207 --> 01:35:03.409
Iris?

01:35:03.409 --> 01:35:04.878
What's that?

01:35:12.252 --> 01:35:14.321
Baek San speaking.

01:35:33.810 --> 01:35:35.278
Come on out.

01:35:41.483 --> 01:35:43.052
Sir.

01:35:43.052 --> 01:35:44.654
Incineration complete.

01:35:44.654 --> 01:35:45.723
Surrender.

01:36:13.386 --> 01:36:17.324
Commissioner Yeon said
the bomb will explode at dawn.

01:36:17.856 --> 01:36:21.494
And there will be a coup d'etat in North as planned.

01:36:21.494 --> 01:36:26.133
Even if the nuclear bomb explodes,
a war must be prevented.

01:36:27.001 --> 01:36:29.904
I'll speak with President Kim.

01:36:29.904 --> 01:36:34.577
Please return to North and stop the coup d'etat.

01:36:35.911 --> 01:36:38.680
I plan on doing the best I can.

01:36:59.403 --> 01:37:02.907
I must return to the republic.

01:37:02.907 --> 01:37:06.612
You must stop the nuclear bomb.

01:37:06.612 --> 01:37:09.815
I have no clue where they planted the bomb.

01:37:09.815 --> 01:37:14.888
Let me know if you find out anything.

01:37:49.026 --> 01:37:51.794
Where is the bomb?

01:37:57.001 --> 01:37:59.939
Mother...Father...

01:38:01.472 --> 01:38:03.108
Your son will be next.

01:38:03.108 --> 01:38:05.544
Stop!

01:38:18.123 --> 01:38:20.227
Target is the Government Complex,

01:38:20.227 --> 01:38:23.630
Amercan Embassy and Cheongwadae.

01:38:23.630 --> 01:38:27.569
That bomb can affect a radius of about 2km.

01:38:28.003 --> 01:38:30.572
To hit all those three places...

01:38:34.776 --> 01:38:36.144
There's only one place.

01:38:36.712 --> 01:38:38.647
Yes, sir.

01:38:40.617 --> 01:38:42.484
We found the target point.

01:38:45.621 --> 01:38:46.890
It's Gwanghwamun.

01:38:47.523 --> 01:38:52.829
They'll detonate the bomb with a wireless control.

01:38:52.829 --> 01:38:54.899
We must jam all communication signals.

01:39:23.829 --> 01:39:27.268
Gwanghwamum Square, South Korea

01:39:49.627 --> 01:39:50.993
Jamming complete.

01:39:59.738 --> 01:40:01.539
It didn't explode.

01:40:01.539 --> 01:40:03.910
Something wrong?

01:40:04.643 --> 01:40:06.411
Impossible.

01:40:06.411 --> 01:40:09.281
We checked several times.

01:40:12.218 --> 01:40:14.588
Where did we get this info?

01:40:14.588 --> 01:40:17.056
Hyun-jun called Cheongwade.

01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:24.198
Where are you going?

01:40:36.945 --> 01:40:41.584
Let's go to Gwanghwamun
and detonate it ourselves.

01:40:43.319 --> 01:40:45.821
That would be suicide.

01:40:45.821 --> 01:40:47.423
What are you saying, sir!

01:40:47.423 --> 01:40:49.425
We didn't come here to die.

01:40:49.425 --> 01:40:50.927
Shut up and listen!

01:40:52.628 --> 01:40:55.668
If it means our deaths to complete this mission,

01:40:57.435 --> 01:41:01.373
our people and country will remember us.

01:41:04.143 --> 01:41:07.513
Gwanghwamum Square, South Korea

01:41:32.842 --> 01:41:34.109
Follow me!

01:41:41.250 --> 01:41:43.119
Check the trunk!

01:41:47.924 --> 01:41:50.794
I need everybody to please exit the bus now!

01:41:52.228 --> 01:41:54.199
Exit the bus now!

01:42:06.244 --> 01:42:07.113
It's not there.

01:42:46.855 --> 01:42:48.024
Run!

01:44:14.253 --> 01:44:17.256
Send our team and EOD unit to Gwanghwamun!

01:44:36.945 --> 01:44:38.247
Gwang-su!

01:44:38.247 --> 01:44:39.414
Get back!

01:44:52.864 --> 01:44:56.968
There's a confrontation
with armed terrorists in Gwanghwamun.

01:44:56.968 --> 01:45:00.671
But police forces are delayed by the heavy traffic.

01:45:00.671 --> 01:45:02.641
Citizens are at rsk.

01:45:09.849 --> 01:45:12.618
I'll cover you! Get back!

01:45:13.253 --> 01:45:14.520
Go!

01:45:54.066 --> 01:45:55.200
Run!

01:46:09.981 --> 01:46:13.518
Long live our republic.

01:46:45.087 --> 01:46:46.822
National lntelligence Service, South Korea

01:47:00.071 --> 01:47:03.741
Since you have accessed my files at NSS,

01:47:04.576 --> 01:47:08.281
I assume you now know much about me.

01:47:08.281 --> 01:47:13.218
As you may know, I killed your parents.

01:47:17.991 --> 01:47:23.631
I was only following orders.

01:47:24.465 --> 01:47:29.837
But you know you were a target as well.

01:47:30.805 --> 01:47:39.649
But I disobeyed, and let you live.

01:47:41.683 --> 01:47:47.859
Your entire life was spent under my design.

01:47:49.494 --> 01:47:54.432
If that's true, why did you desert me?

01:47:55.065 --> 01:48:02.507
That's like asking me
to reveal the identity of my organization.

01:48:04.210 --> 01:48:09.549
It's a secret that will die with me.

01:48:12.284 --> 01:48:13.653
Say it!

01:48:15.588 --> 01:48:18.293
Why did you chose me then threw me away!

01:48:18.293 --> 01:48:20.461
Say it!

01:48:21.394 --> 01:48:22.762
Take him away.

01:48:25.499 --> 01:48:27.634
Let me tell you one thing.

01:48:30.271 --> 01:48:33.874
You ate the forbidden fruit.

01:48:33.874 --> 01:48:36.110
So you've been punished.

01:48:36.110 --> 01:48:40.014
It didn't suppose to happen in your life.

01:49:02.473 --> 01:49:04.241
What is it?

01:49:15.789 --> 01:49:17.691
Kim Sun-hwa

01:49:17.691 --> 01:49:21.630
I heard you're against building a younger,
stronger republic.

01:49:22.197 --> 01:49:23.565
So what?

01:49:30.205 --> 01:49:33.074
Sun-hwa...

01:49:33.074 --> 01:49:37.012
Will you betray the republic, too?

01:49:37.779 --> 01:49:41.216
That is my decision.

01:49:49.793 --> 01:49:51.561
Farewell, sir.

01:50:09.982 --> 01:50:11.952
Are you going to sleep all day?

01:50:18.626 --> 01:50:20.594
Just a little longer.

01:50:21.495 --> 01:50:23.431
I'm hungry.

01:50:25.499 --> 01:50:27.668
Call room service then.

01:50:29.604 --> 01:50:31.373
Come on! Get up!

01:50:32.908 --> 01:50:35.378
Go wash up, now!

01:50:37.411 --> 01:50:38.879
Were you always that strong?

01:50:39.381 --> 01:50:42.050
Don't make me nag.

01:50:53.130 --> 01:50:56.300
How about five?

01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:57.200
Five what?

01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:58.469
Our kids.

01:50:59.604 --> 01:51:03.108
In your dreams!

01:51:03.108 --> 01:51:05.410
Are you asking me to marry you?

01:51:05.410 --> 01:51:07.979
I guess you can say that.

01:51:11.917 --> 01:51:14.421
Just five kids, please?

01:51:15.589 --> 01:51:18.392
Some proposal. Where's the rng?

01:51:18.392 --> 01:51:19.994
I can't accept this.

01:51:19.994 --> 01:51:22.163
Oh, come on!

01:52:41.116 --> 01:52:42.386
Speak.

01:52:45.222 --> 01:52:47.924
Grains have been gleaned.

01:52:47.924 --> 01:52:50.193
We can sow new seeds, sir.

01:53:05.610 --> 01:53:10.282
I'll tell you what your real mission is.

01:53:18.926 --> 01:53:22.862
I'd like to see for myself that Hyun-jun is safe.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.938
They must have fused the bomb here.
