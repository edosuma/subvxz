Yes, but which?

02:29.247 --> 02:31.238
1 994.

02:31.287 --> 02:34.085
- And you're not even a Catholic?
- No.

02:34.127 --> 02:36.163
Look, does it matter?

02:36.207 --> 02:38.801
A great deal. You'd have to convert.

- Well, that's fine, done.
- After lessons.

02:42.007 --> 02:44.965
Ten weeks of instruction

- l was hoping for a spring wedding.
- Have a spring wedding next year.

02:57.327 --> 03:01.445
Look...the very least l'd want to know

03:01.487 --> 03:03.876
is that you're not just marrying here

03:03.927 --> 03:08.717
because you think a civil ceremony
is a cheap and vulgar option for your big day.

03:08.767 --> 03:12.362
What if l could get the whole family
to come for the next three Sundays?

03:12.407 --> 03:15.558
- Would that give us any leeway?
- lt'd make me smile.

03:15.607 --> 03:19.486
But only if you left your father at home.
A spate of thefts in '97.

03:19.527 --> 03:21.836

03:21.887 --> 03:25.800
that we get married here
in less than three months.

03:25.847 --> 03:28.486

03:46.607 --> 03:50.202
Plus, when you nipped to the loo,
it was 200 for the flower displays,

03:50.247 --> 03:53.956
1 00 for the organist and 50 for someone
to watch the cars during the service.

03:54.007 --> 03:55.486
lt's ridiculous!

03:56.487 --> 03:59.126

- Because she's marrying him?
- Yeah, plus other stuff.

11:10.167 --> 11:12.727

1 50 odd grand. lt was in the roof compartment.

11:30.687 --> 11:33.155
You reckon Steve earns
this much nicking motors?

11:33.207 --> 11:35.198
Depends how good he is at saving.

11:37.767 --> 11:38.882

- Pepe's waistcoat, for the wedding.
- Ah! lt's beautiful.

12:18.687 --> 12:23.124
But the only hat we've found he's not
thrilled about - makes him look like a chimp.

12:23.167 --> 12:26.318
Mum, it's a church.
Fiona won't want a dog yapping.

12:26.367 --> 12:29.484
He won't yap. He doesn't yap.

12:29.527 --> 12:33.964

- ''Carol and guest.''

12:34.007 --> 12:36.726
Meaning Marty.
His says the same, meaning you.

12:36.767 --> 12:38.485

12:38.527 --> 12:41.917
Your husband's dead and Pepe is a dog.

12:41.967 --> 12:45.482
She's cheaper than a husband
if it's catering we're talking about.

12:45.527 --> 12:50.601
And a bit more talkative,
which, you know Veronica, l'm very grateful for.

12:51.767 --> 12:55.157

14:09.407 --> 14:10.760
lt's the same model.

14:10.807 --> 14:13.480
Apart from different colour and registration,

14:13.527 --> 14:15.483
these cars could be twins.

14:15.527 --> 14:17.961
He rings cars for a living.

14:18.007 --> 14:23.127
Changing the colour and registration
is what Steve does for a living.

14:23.167 --> 14:27.479
- This car's been abroad. Why?
- So's mine.

14:27.527 --> 14:30.724
l'm not talking about a car park in Wrexham.

14:30.767 --> 14:33.440
Steve's car came into Britain from Spain.
What's that say?

14:33.487 --> 14:35.318
Timeshare.

14:39.007 --> 14:41.396
MUSlC: Put Him Out by Ms Dynamite

14:41.447 --> 14:43.961
Let's have it. Come on. Get on that beat.

14:52.767 --> 14:56.316
Sorry, Lillian, love. Sorry, Lillian.

14:56.367 --> 14:58.642
Lillian.

14:58.687 --> 15:00.757
OK, go for it.

15:00.807 --> 15:04.083
THEY LAUGH

15:04.127 --> 15:08.006
l don't know why l'm laughing.
l'm having a flashback to Strangeways.

15:08.047 --> 15:09.878
(All) Ooh!

15:09.927 --> 15:12.487
Only here for the first time, Frank.

15:12.527 --> 15:14.677
Our Fiona...

15:14.727 --> 15:18.481
was...was my first-born.

15:18.527 --> 15:20.279
lt's a happy day

15:20.327 --> 15:25.606
and a sad day for us all
to see her marrying Steve.

15:26.647 --> 15:29.525
(All) Steve-o!

15:29.567 --> 15:34.687
..Starting a brand new life.
She's guided all of us through difficult times.

15:35.687 --> 15:43.275
For the family she has been a total godsend
and we couldn't have managed without her.

15:43.327 --> 15:45.079
That's what you said.

15:45.127 --> 15:48.244
We can all say from the bottom of our hearts

15:48.287 --> 15:54.522
that she is really the other half...
of all of us.

15:56.967 --> 16:00.801
That's... Honestly, that's...
Fucking hell, l'm welling up here.

16:00.847 --> 16:03.919
Thieving bastard! He nicked that out of my bag!

16:03.967 --> 16:06.606
(Frank) He was a poet and he knew it.

16:06.647 --> 16:11.880
- You said you didn't want to give her away.
- l've changed my mind now.

16:13.207 --> 16:16.677
lf you keep that up,
the least l'll want is a blow job.

16:16.727 --> 16:19.878
Any more of that talk
l'll pin your whatsit to your knackers!

16:19.927 --> 16:21.121
CHEERlNG

16:25.207 --> 16:28.643
- Where were you before we picked you up?
- At Eden Club.

16:28.687 --> 16:32.123
Eden Club?
That'll be the Eden club in town, will it?

16:37.287 --> 16:39.801
(ls she getting ready? Let me look.)

16:39.847 --> 16:41.246
(All) Oh!

16:41.287 --> 16:42.766
lt's beautiful!

16:44.727 --> 16:45.876
Give us a go.

16:45.927 --> 16:47.963
l'm so nervous!

16:48.007 --> 16:50.157
Eh up. Are you ready?

16:53.487 --> 16:54.886
THEY LAUGH

16:59.927 --> 17:01.519
You look beautiful.

17:01.567 --> 17:03.956
- You do.
- Oh, my God!

17:11.967 --> 17:14.196
(Priest) Exchanging of the vows.

17:14.247 --> 17:15.281
Thank you, Veronica.

17:15.327 --> 17:18.046
You will lead the wedding procession.

17:18.087 --> 17:19.679
Slowly on the day, Fiona.

17:19.727 --> 17:24.436
Philip, this is where you hand over
Fiona to Steve - let go of her arm.

17:24.487 --> 17:27.126
All right. Now?!

17:28.687 --> 17:30.245
''l'll greet the bride and bridegroom

17:30.287 --> 17:33.836
''in a friendly manner,
showing that the Church shares their joy.''

17:39.887 --> 17:42.799
(Priest) Kevin, give the ring to Steve.

17:42.847 --> 17:44.041
Repeat after me.

17:44.087 --> 17:48.763
- l, Steve McBride...
- l, Steve McBride...

17:48.807 --> 17:51.719
- Do take thee...
- Do take thee, Fiona Gallagher...

17:51.767 --> 17:54.964
- To be my lawful wedded wife...
- To be my lawful wedded wife...

17:55.007 --> 17:56.201
To have and to hold...

17:56.247 --> 17:57.236
To have and...

17:57.287 --> 18:00.723
MOBlLE RlNGS
Excuse me. Sorry about this.

18:01.887 --> 18:04.321
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

18:04.367 --> 18:05.846
Two secs.

18:08.167 --> 18:09.441
l have to shoot off.

18:10.647 --> 18:13.002
- Steve!
- lt'll be fine.

18:13.047 --> 18:15.402
l just had to get it through my head.

18:15.447 --> 18:18.996
Kev, can l borrow you for two secs?
Quicker than that, mate.

18:19.047 --> 18:19.797
Steve!

18:19.847 --> 18:22.077
- Kev!
- l'm best man, aren't l?

18:26.327 --> 18:28.079
Steve!

18:32.327 --> 18:34.079
TYRES SCREECH

18:37.527 --> 18:38.755
ls it?

18:41.567 --> 18:42.761
Where did you find it?

18:42.807 --> 18:45.640
Wide boys showing off on the M60.

18:45.687 --> 18:48.520
No damage apart from the ignition.

18:48.567 --> 18:50.558
How good do you feel, eh?!

18:50.607 --> 18:52.086
These are on me.

18:52.127 --> 18:55.563
Not for me, Kev, not if l'm driving and...
l am now.

18:57.087 --> 19:00.523
Listen. l'll sort you out
with the, you know, tomorrow.

19:00.567 --> 19:02.285
Nah, forget about it, Steve.

19:03.967 --> 19:05.116
l'm just glad to be of some use.

19:05.167 --> 19:07.727
We can be. Sometimes.

19:09.647 --> 19:11.000
All right. See you later.

19:11.047 --> 19:12.321
Kev, thanks for the lift.

19:13.607 --> 19:18.397
Has Jensen Button turned his nose up at that?
Let this blind lady through.

19:18.447 --> 19:20.915
Who the fuck are you calling blind?

19:20.967 --> 19:21.843
Sorry.

19:21.887 --> 19:24.401
Fuck you dressed like that for?

19:28.687 --> 19:31.724
- Don't start with me, Frank.
- She started it.

19:31.767 --> 19:36.079
She started it! They should put a sign up
about nice behaviour.

19:36.127 --> 19:40.917
lt's a Government thing now.
You've got to be caring...

19:45.687 --> 19:48.565
CHEERlNG
Look at that!

19:48.607 --> 19:50.404
Oh, smell that!

19:53.647 --> 19:55.319
This is fantastic, Yvonne.

19:55.367 --> 19:58.200
Are you sure you can cater for
50-odd people by this weekend?

19:58.247 --> 20:01.922
- You should see when l've got t'family round.
- She lives for the challenge.

20:01.967 --> 20:05.516
- Did you teach her how to cook like this?
- Yeah(!) lt's all tins with him.

20:05.567 --> 20:09.685
The microwave pings that often,
the kids think it's the fire alarm.

20:09.727 --> 20:12.321
Do you like it? See, even for kids.

20:13.127 --> 20:16.119
l'll tone it down
so there's something for everyone.

20:16.167 --> 20:19.079
Give me a curry instead of
a scabby prawn cocktail any day.

20:19.127 --> 20:21.561
Too spicy for me. Never used to be.

20:21.607 --> 20:23.518
End of another era.

20:23.567 --> 20:29.517
Pilau rice, samosas, bhajis...
You name it, l've got it.

20:29.567 --> 20:31.683
- Why?
- Why d'you think?

20:32.487 --> 20:37.163
Three-day mystery cruise round the Bay of
Biscay.

20:37.207 --> 20:42.327
- How's that a mystery?
- Agatha Christie murder mystery tour!

20:42.367 --> 20:46.519
Argh, Marty!

20:48.887 --> 20:51.959
l'm going on a cruise!

20:53.327 --> 20:56.524
- Sorry. Come at a bad time?
- What's up?

20:56.567 --> 20:58.285
- Where did you get the money?
- Money Dad left me.

20:58.327 --> 20:59.680
We're off upstairs.

20:59.727 --> 21:01.957
(Carol) That money is meant for you.

21:02.007 --> 21:04.202
But if you're happy, so am l.

21:05.287 --> 21:06.800
Bit of homework.

21:06.847 --> 21:09.884
l'll be shutting the door,
we need peace and quiet.

21:09.927 --> 21:11.519
l'm just reading it.

21:11.567 --> 21:13.125
< Fuck off!

21:13.167 --> 21:15.556
Have it then!

21:15.607 --> 21:16.835
Talk about jealous!

21:20.007 --> 21:23.204
As long as you know
l'm only doing this for lan.

21:23.247 --> 21:25.044
Same here.

21:25.087 --> 21:27.123
l hope he's grateful cos...

21:28.887 --> 21:30.081
Wow!

21:30.127 --> 21:33.278
Don't wow, it's not for you.

21:33.327 --> 21:35.124
No problem.

21:37.527 --> 21:38.482
Wow!

21:38.527 --> 21:41.360
Stick a bonnet on that
it'd look like a microphone.

21:41.407 --> 21:42.920
Whatever.

21:42.967 --> 21:45.686
You sing, l'll dance.

21:58.887 --> 22:00.400
The batteries are going on this.

22:00.447 --> 22:01.562
Fuck off!

22:22.927 --> 22:27.045
- Fiona know you're dealing?
- l don't know what you're talking about.

22:27.087 --> 22:31.319
Do you think l'm taping this,
like l want to hear this more than once?

22:31.367 --> 22:33.483
Get real.

22:33.527 --> 22:35.757
Tony, the stuff you've got is not mine.

22:35.807 --> 22:37.763
Looking after it for a mate(?)

22:37.807 --> 22:39.718
No, just somebody l know.

22:39.767 --> 22:41.439
Mind if l sit down?

22:53.327 --> 22:54.919
Been away recently?

22:56.487 --> 22:57.840
No.

22:57.887 --> 22:59.036
Spain?

23:00.167 --> 23:01.441
No.

23:01.487 --> 23:06.242
Chassis number from that car
matches a jeep that came via Spain.

23:06.287 --> 23:09.324
Different reg plate, and colour, obviously.

23:09.367 --> 23:11.835
ls that where all your cars are coming from?

23:11.887 --> 23:13.240
Just the occasional one.

23:13.287 --> 23:14.640
How occasional?

23:14.687 --> 23:17.884
Two...three a year. Three.

23:23.407 --> 23:28.117
How did you get to be involved
in a racket like this? Bloody drugs.

23:28.167 --> 23:31.955
lt's an occasional thing to pay off an old debt.

23:32.007 --> 23:34.840
l don't wanna do it, but l have to pay this off.

23:34.887 --> 23:38.357
The car owners
never know the cargo they're carrying.

23:38.407 --> 23:41.444
l get told which car to target.
l pick it up, l ring it and then my...

23:41.487 --> 23:44.524
mates come and pick up their cargo.

23:44.567 --> 23:47.081
l get a small wage
and l move the car off on my own.

23:53.167 --> 23:57.399
Name a price, give me
the stuff and have done with this.

23:57.447 --> 24:02.237
You think l want a slice of some of this?!
Drug money?

24:02.287 --> 24:04.039
What else are we here for?

24:10.687 --> 24:13.565
Am l right in guessing that Fiona doesn't know?

24:13.607 --> 24:19.477
So, nothing about the money that
she'll be spending as a wife of Steve McBride?

24:19.527 --> 24:21.995
Nothing about the life
she's letting herself in for?

24:22.047 --> 24:26.802
You don't have a fucking clue. l'm dead if l don't
get the gear where it belongs by Wednesday!

24:26.847 --> 24:29.156
Precisely! You're not dealing with cowboys.

24:29.207 --> 24:32.961
Debts like these go on for ever,
don't they, Steve?

24:58.887 --> 25:00.605
Fine.

25:00.647 --> 25:03.241
How safe's Fiona?

25:04.287 --> 25:08.883
lf l hadn't nicked that car to wind you up,
how safe would she be now?

25:10.767 --> 25:14.316
Ever do anything to harm her,

25:14.367 --> 25:18.758
l want you to know, Steve,
l'll make you regret it for the rest of your life.

25:24.127 --> 25:27.483
- l've never been caught, Tony.
- l caught you!

25:33.807 --> 25:38.722
- Promise me now you'll put a stop to it.
- l'm trying.

25:38.767 --> 25:41.361
Promise, or you're getting fuck all.

25:45.167 --> 25:46.805
Please...

25:49.607 --> 25:51.359
l need it by Wednesday.

26:36.567 --> 26:39.400
- What?
- Upstairs.

26:46.567 --> 26:50.003
What you and Mandy Maguire get up to
in private is your own business.

26:50.047 --> 26:53.244
l'm glad you're sensible enough
to use protection, lan.

26:53.287 --> 26:56.324
But if you ever leave your bed in this state
thinking l'm gonna clear it up,

26:56.367 --> 26:58.085
you've another bloody thing coming!

26:59.607 --> 27:02.246
Shift that condom
and give Mandy Maguire her knickers back!

27:02.287 --> 27:04.676
- What's he done now?
- Mind your own business!

27:04.727 --> 27:07.287
Eugh, state of that bed, you scummy git!

27:07.327 --> 27:09.124
- Sorry, Fiona.
- You'd better be.

27:09.167 --> 27:12.603
l'm not getting married so l can baby-sit you lot
for the rest of my life.

27:12.647 --> 27:15.878
Strip that bed and stick it on a boil wash!

27:20.087 --> 27:23.841
- But you shift your leftovers.
- On your bike!

27:27.207 --> 27:30.244
Plus, Mandy Maguire slipped me a note
at school. She wants a rematch.

27:30.287 --> 27:33.324
- Be careful, though.
- Never not.

27:33.367 --> 27:35.881
No, l mean you can't get caught
if l'm not there. Eugh.

27:35.927 --> 27:38.361
- He wants to watch!
- No, l'm saying...

27:38.407 --> 27:40.841
- You dirty little deviant!
- Yeah, right.

27:40.887 --> 27:43.765
Cheesy little homo
wants to see how the carnivores do it!

27:43.807 --> 27:45.479
Eurgh!

27:45.527 --> 27:46.880
THEY LAUGH

27:50.207 --> 27:54.166
- What is it?
- l don't know, but thank God we killed it.

27:54.207 --> 27:57.165
-Come on, Mam!
- Come on, Carol. Foot on the gas!

27:57.207 --> 28:00.597
Easier said than done in this!

28:00.647 --> 28:04.196
GASPS AND WHlSTLES

28:04.247 --> 28:07.000
Oh! Wish l was coming now.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.603
- An Agatha Christie honeymoon,
what would l wear?

28:10.647 --> 28:11.716
An axe in the back.

28:11.767 --> 28:14.804
- Bye! See ya!
- See you, Carol.

28:14.847 --> 28:16.599
See you Saturday, it's the wedding!

28:16.647 --> 28:18.922
(All) See ya! Bye!

28:22.247 --> 28:27.958
Say goodbye to mummy. Wave goodbye.
Bye-bye, mummy.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.601
PEPE WHlMPERS

28:31.167 --> 28:32.839
Come on.

28:32.887 --> 28:35.162
Come on, Pepe, come on.

28:35.207 --> 28:37.277
Come on, that's it. Come on.

28:37.327 --> 28:39.079
Hey. Come on.

28:39.127 --> 28:42.119
Who's a good boy? Lamb!

28:42.167 --> 28:46.558
Come on. That's it. Good boy. Slaughter!
Come on.

28:46.607 --> 28:49.280
Come to Marty.
Look what Marty's got for you.

28:58.247 --> 29:02.479
Are you ready? Go on. Are you ready?
Go on. Yeah.

29:02.527 --> 29:05.599
Sweet dreams!
HE LAUGHS

29:05.647 --> 29:10.926
- l'd recommend Barbados for a honeymoon.
- Oh, yeah? Where did you stay?

29:10.967 --> 29:13.640
We haven't been, l just recommend it.

29:13.687 --> 29:16.520
ln that case, l recommend Palestine.

29:16.567 --> 29:22.164
l don't mean Palestine, do l? Where did
Beverly go when she won the lottery?

29:22.207 --> 29:24.243
- Dubai.
- Dubai!

29:27.887 --> 29:29.718
(Marty) What?

29:29.767 --> 29:31.564
(Veronica) Where you off?

29:31.607 --> 29:33.757
- Just to a mate's.
- Oh?

29:40.247 --> 29:42.044
Requiem!

29:43.847 --> 29:46.680
- He looks a bit lost without your mum.
- Not lost enough.

29:46.727 --> 29:49.195
- Has he got any mates?
- No. Anyway...

29:49.247 --> 29:52.239
Dubai. Loved it.
Said it were like Blackpool with money.

29:52.287 --> 29:55.245
Came back like a beetroot
with a bloke who made watches.

29:55.287 --> 29:56.766
THEY LAUGH

29:56.807 --> 29:59.879
lt's just not something
we can do to a healthy dog.

29:59.927 --> 30:02.157
lt goes against everything that we...

30:02.207 --> 30:05.005
l wouldn't mind,
but when he bites, it's never that deep.

30:05.047 --> 30:08.119
The most he's ever given anyone
is seven stitches.

30:08.167 --> 30:10.556
But it's the noise. Noise.
HE BARKS

30:10.607 --> 30:14.395
There's been two attempts
on his life by the neighbours.

30:14.447 --> 30:15.800
l presume the police have intervened.

30:18.687 --> 30:21.440
With a court order?

PEPE WHlMPERS

30:24.487 --> 30:25.966
Yep.

30:26.007 --> 30:27.725
OK.

30:27.767 --> 30:29.644
OK. Get Mr Fisher a cup of tea.

30:29.687 --> 30:34.317
PEPE WHlMPERS

30:34.367 --> 30:36.801

30:38.207 --> 30:39.196

30:42.407 --> 30:44.204
Yes, please.

30:44.767 --> 30:46.405
HORN BLARES

30:49.207 --> 30:54.964
- How are you doing? Where's Tonto?
- Tonsillitis. 42 and tonsillitis.

30:55.007 --> 30:56.725
You wouldn't even tell anybody, would you?

30:56.767 --> 31:00.965
Tonto made it up to avoid getting
in the car with this dick dressed like Dracula.

31:01.007 --> 31:02.645
Eh! What's wrong with it?

31:02.687 --> 31:08.205
- You'd buy one of these, wouldn't you, Steve?
- Yeah, maybe one that fitted me better.

31:08.247 --> 31:10.807
- Nice one.
- All right, here we go.

31:16.647 --> 31:18.842
- Good work.

Face down on the ground, all of you!

31:35.807 --> 31:39.356

- Get down!

31:39.407 --> 31:41.284
All right, all right!

31:41.327 --> 31:43.841
Hands on your head where l can see them.

31:45.647 --> 31:47.205
Armed with what?

31:48.607 --> 31:51.041
One crack of this will break your arm, pal.

31:51.087 --> 31:53.840
- Come on, l'm warning you.
- Yeah? Paper, rock, scissors!

31:53.887 --> 31:55.206
Woah!

31:55.247 --> 31:59.081
- Fucking hell! Calm down, everybody!
- Get back!

31:59.127 --> 32:02.915
- Calm down, mate. lt's cool.
- Easy. Where's that come from?

32:02.967 --> 32:05.561

32:08.207 --> 32:12.405

l'm probably away from my desk...'

32:12.447 --> 32:14.722
- Are we off?
- Steve's not back yet.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.564
Goody-goody, rum-rum.

32:16.607 --> 32:20.361
- Does he know the taxi's booked for eight?
- Yeah, he booked it.

32:23.647 --> 32:27.276
This is the kind of life you think Fiona deserves,
eh, Steve?

32:28.367 --> 32:31.040
You know him!?

32:31.087 --> 32:33.123
- We could just walk out. We've seen nothing.
- Like fuck you can!

32:33.167 --> 32:36.921
Put the gun down, this is just silly.
lt's fucking stupid.

32:36.967 --> 32:41.916
- For fuck's sake, Steve!
- Tell him to put the gun down, this is stupid.

32:41.967 --> 32:43.446
< How do you know him?

32:43.487 --> 32:46.126
- He's an undercover.
- Don't talk rubbish, mate!

32:47.127 --> 32:50.961
We've been nothing but mates to you.
We haven't shit on you once.

32:51.007 --> 32:53.237
l did not know they were going to be here.
Tony, tell them.

32:54.047 --> 32:58.484
Seeing as they are, think you're walking
out of here with the money and the gear?

33:01.407 --> 33:02.999
(Steve) We can sort this out, mate.

33:05.447 --> 33:07.517
l'll wait for you outside.

33:07.567 --> 33:09.603
What am l supposed to do?!

33:10.927 --> 33:16.638
Steve won't mind you taking his car.
He won't be needing it.

33:23.047 --> 33:26.278
Mack! We can sort this out between us.

33:26.327 --> 33:29.399
Come on, mate, just put the gun down.

Do you know what's gonna happen, Tony?!
They're going to think l set them up!

34:41.047 --> 34:43.844
They're gonna come after me and kill me.

34:48.647 --> 34:51.764
They're going to kill me, Tony.

37:02.007 --> 37:04.202
(Veronica) Have you tried Steve's other house?

37:04.247 --> 37:07.000
No, Veronica,
the thought never occurred to me(!)

37:08.327 --> 37:11.717
His tenants haven't seen him since Friday.

37:11.767 --> 37:12.722
DOG TRlES TO BARK

37:12.767 --> 37:15.406

-He just wants letting out!

37:15.447 --> 37:18.166
Yeah, but what's wrong with the dog?

37:19.887 --> 37:20.876
l'm going to bed.

37:20.927 --> 37:23.999

37:48.487 --> 37:50.842
He's poorly. How long's he been like this?

37:50.887 --> 37:54.323
- Just lost his voice.
- A dog can't lose its voice, Marty.

37:54.367 --> 37:56.961
He can if you pay enough...

38:03.287 --> 38:04.800
HE BARKS

38:22.407 --> 38:25.717
You knew exactly what you were doing.

38:25.767 --> 38:27.359
You set me up as a grass.

38:27.407 --> 38:30.479
So that l have no option
but to trust someone like you.

38:30.527 --> 38:34.315
- l was trying to help.
- How was that helping?

38:34.367 --> 38:36.198
Fiona's best interests...

38:36.247 --> 38:39.125
Fuck off! One guy is dead, Tony.

38:39.167 --> 38:42.637
The other's going to come
screaming down the M62 with his mates

38:42.687 --> 38:44.996
- and take my FUCKlNG head off!
- You're safe.

38:45.047 --> 38:47.515
Ollie got lifted before
he made it back to Liverpool.

38:49.087 --> 38:52.159
Hard as nails
until he realised it was a murder inquiry.

38:52.207 --> 38:53.959
Now he's singing like a choirboy.

38:54.007 --> 38:56.157
Naming all his mates for a plea bargain.

38:56.207 --> 38:59.005
The drug squad are rounding them all up.

39:00.927 --> 39:03.441
So l'm safe?

39:03.487 --> 39:05.284
That's your debt cleared.

39:07.487 --> 39:10.320
He thinks l set him up, Tony.

39:11.687 --> 39:14.440
How's he not gonna name me?

39:14.487 --> 39:19.163
They've issued a warrant for your arrest...
at your old address.

39:19.207 --> 39:21.357
They want us keeping our eyes peeled for him.

39:21.407 --> 39:24.160
You brainless cunt.

39:25.927 --> 39:27.724
You've got me and Stan as witnesses.

39:27.767 --> 39:30.042
We'll say you were nowhere near the incident.

39:30.087 --> 39:31.566
That's just fine, isn't it?

39:33.327 --> 39:36.205
- What about the coke?
- What?

39:36.247 --> 39:38.920
Where's the coke?

39:38.967 --> 39:43.006
That's Bibby's coke. You said so.

39:43.047 --> 39:46.403
That's evidence for the drug squad.
Without that, we'd never get a conviction.

39:47.407 --> 39:50.638
Thanks to you,
my prints are all over those bags.

39:52.607 --> 39:53.596
Aren't they?

40:01.727 --> 40:05.163
Unless you took time to clean
every single last one of them...

40:05.207 --> 40:07.198

41:30.327 --> 41:32.716

42:22.647 --> 42:23.682

42:37.447 --> 42:39.563
You all right, Kev?

42:39.607 --> 42:42.280
Yeah, you look after your sister, right?

42:42.327 --> 42:43.760

Brother-in-law. Five-and-a-half grand.
No time to beat him down.

42:50.807 --> 42:53.196
l can't believe l'm seeing this.
Ring me when you get...wherever.

42:53.247 --> 42:54.441
- Promise.
- Oh, God.

42:54.487 --> 42:56.921
We need to shift it,
or someone will wonder what we're doing here.

42:56.967 --> 42:58.639
Everyone, coats on!

43:00.847 --> 43:03.600
Thank you, mate. All right?

43:05.287 --> 43:07.118
