00:04.850 --> 00:08.020
Why is Sikowitz always late to class?

00:08.060 --> 00:10.520
Maybe we could try
an acting scene on our own.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.420
Ooo!

00:11.460 --> 00:15.330
What if we act out
the final scene from Titanic.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.400
When the boat sinks?!

00:17.430 --> 00:20.000
Oh my God I just gave away the ending.

00:20.040 --> 00:23.570
Spoiler alert!

00:23.610 --> 00:24.840
Y'know, whenever she starts talkin',

00:24.880 --> 00:28.080
I think to myself, "maybe
this time it'll make sense"...

00:28.110 --> 00:30.550
I'm always wrong.

00:30.580 --> 00:32.950
Oh.

00:32.990 --> 00:36.590
C'mon man! Why won't it...

00:36.620 --> 00:39.090
- Your phone's making noise.
- I think she knows that.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.160
You don't know what she knows.

00:40.190 --> 00:41.220
I know you're being obnoxious.

00:41.260 --> 00:43.590
Ohhh.

00:43.630 --> 00:46.360
Why does it keep... ?!

00:46.400 --> 00:48.300
Robbie, would you please unplug that cord,

00:48.330 --> 00:50.200
count to three, and then plug it back in?!

00:50.230 --> 00:51.340
Surely girly.

00:56.860 --> 00:58.710
One I love grandma...

00:59.780 --> 01:00.980
Two I love grandma...

01:01.010 --> 01:04.080
Plug it in!!

01:04.120 --> 01:05.180
Thanks.

01:05.220 --> 01:06.790
Why's your phone all janked?

01:06.820 --> 01:09.090
You tell me!
It should work fine.

01:09.120 --> 01:11.860
How many times have you
dropped it in the toilet?

01:12.490 --> 01:14.210
Only three!

01:15.730 --> 01:17.200
Anyway, now it won't stay charged.

01:17.230 --> 01:19.770
So I have to keep it plugged in
all the time.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.500
- Just get a new phone.
- Don't give her advice.

01:21.540 --> 01:22.640
- I was just...
- Don't.

01:22.670 --> 01:23.600
Man, you make me happy!

01:23.640 --> 01:26.640
- Blehhh.
- Blehhh.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.510
My father's embarrassed of me.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.510
You really should just get
a new pear phone.

01:32.550 --> 01:35.820
If I buy a new pear phone now
I have to get another GX,

01:35.850 --> 01:40.960
but people say the pear phone XT
might come out next month.

01:40.990 --> 01:42.730
They announced it?

01:42.760 --> 01:45.290
No, but they're supposed
to tell us this week.

01:45.330 --> 01:47.060
When they're gonna make the announcement.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.900
So you're waiting for the
announcement of the announcement?

01:50.840 --> 01:53.570
Girl, you're better than that.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.170
Just buy another GX.

01:55.210 --> 01:58.640
Nooooo... if I buy the GX,
then the new XT'll come out.

01:58.680 --> 02:01.640
The next day and then I'll
be stuck with a stupid GX.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.950
While everybody else has the cool new XT.

02:03.980 --> 02:05.950
Hey if we're gonna keep
talking about Tori's phone,

02:05.980 --> 02:07.550
could someone please take me to a car door.

02:07.580 --> 02:11.390
So I can slam my face in it?

02:11.420 --> 02:13.790
I have a car.

02:13.820 --> 02:16.760
Oohhh.

02:16.790 --> 02:18.160
Hey, I have an announcement.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.000
Is it about the new pear phone XT?!

02:20.030 --> 02:22.870
No, sit down.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.500
You guys know that game show I invented?

02:24.540 --> 02:26.240
Queries for couples?

02:26.270 --> 02:28.300
Queries?

02:28.340 --> 02:29.840
What about your game show?

02:29.870 --> 02:32.640
Well, I met with the people
from gamegoober. Com,

02:32.680 --> 02:35.080
and told them about the idea,
and they wanna do it!

02:35.110 --> 02:36.610
Great bye.

02:36.650 --> 02:37.580
Wait.

02:37.620 --> 02:39.350
I'm doing a rehearsal
of the show tomorrow night.

02:39.380 --> 02:41.420
For the guy who runs game goober...

02:41.450 --> 02:43.350
Harvey goobensteen?

02:43.390 --> 02:44.120

02:48.730 --> 02:50.360
- Awesome.

Hoo hoo!

02:59.170 --> 03:00.400
Ohhhhh...

03:00.440 --> 03:02.540
All right, I can't take that phone anymore.

03:02.570 --> 03:04.570
- Will ya fix that chiz?
- She's...

03:04.610 --> 03:05.910
- Turn off.
- Really annoying.

03:05.940 --> 03:09.780
Okay, okay.
Fine, I'll just unplug it!

03:09.810 --> 03:13.550
Whoa!!!

03:13.580 --> 03:16.350
Oh my God. Are you okay?!

03:16.390 --> 03:21.260
- Yeah.
- Would you plug it back in?

Here I am once again feeling lost.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
But now and then

03:29.030 --> 03:33.740
I breathe it in to let it go.

03:33.770 --> 03:36.740
And you don't know where you are now.

03:36.770 --> 03:38.210
Or what it will come to.

03:38.240 --> 03:41.880
If only somebody could hear.

03:41.910 --> 03:44.010
When you figure out how.

03:44.050 --> 03:45.580
You're lost in the moment.

03:45.620 --> 03:49.180
You disappear.

03:49.220 --> 03:50.580
You don't have to be afraid.

03:50.620 --> 03:52.690
To put your dream in action.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.050
You're never gonna fade.

03:54.090 --> 03:56.820
You'll be the main attraction.

03:56.860 --> 03:58.490
Not a.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.050
Just remember me.

04:00.090 --> 04:02.580
When it turns out right

04:02.620 --> 04:03.850
'cause you know.

04:03.890 --> 04:04.820
That if you live.

04:04.850 --> 04:06.820
In your imagination.

04:06.860 --> 04:08.020
Tomorrow you'll be.

04:08.060 --> 04:10.820
Everybody's fascination.

04:10.860 --> 04:12.620
In my victory.

Would you pass this down?

04:52.680 --> 04:54.480
I need to plug in my phone.

04:54.510 --> 04:55.680
Hi, little help?

04:55.710 --> 04:57.010
Little help?

04:57.050 --> 04:59.280
Help my friend Tori plug in her phone.

04:59.320 --> 05:00.850
Thanks, guys.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.550
Um, before we start,

05:02.580 --> 05:05.750
I'd like to introduce the wonderful

05:05.790 --> 05:08.850
Mister Harvey goobensteen.

05:11.890 --> 05:14.420

05:34.770 --> 05:36.740

05:37.380 --> 05:39.340
Now let's meet our contestants.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.240
Couple number one
hails from burbank, and...

05:41.280 --> 05:44.250
Hey... hey ragtop...

05:44.280 --> 05:46.010
Uh, excuse me for a moment.

05:46.050 --> 05:48.820
Hey Northridge.

05:48.850 --> 05:51.420
Would you just plug it into the wall there.

05:52.450 --> 05:54.210
Thanks.

05:55.490 --> 05:58.730
Some girls aren't so smart.

05:58.760 --> 06:03.130
Uh huh.

06:03.420 --> 06:08.170
- Yay, my phone came on.
- Yay, my phone came on.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.600

06:14.610 --> 06:16.910
- Yes!
- Yes!

06:16.940 --> 06:18.210
Turn it off.

06:18.240 --> 06:22.040
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

06:22.080 --> 06:24.450
Ooooch!

06:24.480 --> 06:25.580
Okay...

06:25.610 --> 06:30.250
Mister goobensteen feels that a game show
should have better-looking contestants.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.870
He's not wrong.

06:32.850 --> 06:36.090
So I'm gonna say goodnight to you guys...

06:36.540 --> 06:38.010
Go on...

06:41.290 --> 06:42.630
Don't worry...

06:42.760 --> 06:44.210
It's nothing personal...

06:44.890 --> 06:47.660
It's just your appearances.

06:47.850 --> 06:50.350
Now... uhhh...

06:53.340 --> 06:55.570
Will you guys please be my test couples?

06:55.610 --> 06:58.410
But none of us are dating,
except for Beck and Jade.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.280
That's okay.
Will you guys do it?

07:00.310 --> 07:03.580
- Well I...
- Don't blow this for me, Tori!

07:07.680 --> 07:10.520
Okay, it's time to play...

07:10.550 --> 07:15.120
Queries for couples.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.320
Thaaaaat's right!

07:19.590 --> 07:24.450
Live, from Northridge.
It's: Queries for couples!

07:29.530 --> 07:33.210
- We're not really a couple.
- Shush!

07:34.370 --> 07:38.140
Now, say hello
to our query girl, Trina Vega!

07:47.450 --> 07:49.650
Hello sinjin.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.730
- You're not supposed to talk.
- I'll talk if I wanna talk.

07:54.650 --> 07:55.600
Okay!

07:56.200 --> 08:00.040
Let's take a look at our first
query for couple number one.

08:01.940 --> 08:05.240
Andre, Cat has bad breath.

08:05.270 --> 08:07.670
It's just pretend.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.980
Do you, a: Tell her she has bad breath;

08:11.010 --> 08:12.780
B, ignore it because you love her;

08:12.810 --> 08:14.710
Or c, dump her.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.680
Cat, go ahead and use your corded remote.

08:16.720 --> 08:20.120
To secretly choose what you
think Andre's answer should be.

08:20.150 --> 08:22.090
Okay!

08:22.120 --> 08:25.560
Beeeee.

08:25.590 --> 08:27.460
Cat, you don't say it out loud.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.580
That's okay.
This is just a rehearsal.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.409
Andre, your answer.

08:33.630 --> 08:35.970
I'm gonna go with b.

08:36.010 --> 08:37.210
Yay!

08:37.240 --> 08:40.840
Easy, now. Don't start
something you can't finish.

08:40.880 --> 08:44.550
Okay. Our next query is
for Tori and Robbie.

08:44.580 --> 08:47.450
- I say that!
- Well, I should get to say something!

08:47.480 --> 08:49.850
No!

08:49.890 --> 08:52.990
Now, let's look at our query
for Tori and Robbie.

08:53.020 --> 08:57.030
Tori, Robbie has a pimple
on his back that he can't reach.

08:57.060 --> 08:58.480
That has happened to me.

08:59.870 --> 09:03.200
Not really my boyfriend!

09:03.240 --> 09:05.870
Do you, a, take him to the doctor;

09:05.910 --> 09:08.610
B, wait for the pimple
to explode on its own;

09:08.640 --> 09:11.210
Or c, pop it for him.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.350
Robbie, lock in the answer
you think Tori will choose.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.310
Hmmm.

09:15.350 --> 09:18.550
What will my girlfriend Tori say?

09:18.590 --> 09:22.690
Ah!

09:22.720 --> 09:25.800
So Tori, what are we gonna do
about that back zit?

09:26.960 --> 09:29.600
Well, I think that I would choose a,

09:29.630 --> 09:32.960
take him to a doctor.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.270
And Robbie predicted
you'd say, c, pop it for him.

09:39.310 --> 09:41.040
- Gross.
- My mom does it for me.

09:41.070 --> 09:43.320
Well, maybe that's why
she screams in her sleep.

09:44.740 --> 09:48.390
And now for our final couple,
Beck and Jade.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.530
Your query is...

09:55.150 --> 09:56.550
Hello? Tori?

09:56.590 --> 09:58.550
You're taking a phone call now?

09:58.590 --> 10:00.890
I didn't even press answer!

10:00.930 --> 10:02.860
I'm sorry, my phone is very broken!

10:02.890 --> 10:04.290
Mom, I can't talk now!

10:04.330 --> 10:07.600
- Can you hear me?
- Hi, Mrs. Vega.

10:07.630 --> 10:09.500
- Toriiiii?
- Turn it off!

10:09.530 --> 10:11.400
I'm pressing end call!

10:11.440 --> 10:14.170
- I can't hear you.
- Mom, just hang up!

10:14.210 --> 10:18.010
I'm at the drugstore.
Do you want me to buy you some more ointment...

10:19.580 --> 10:21.680
I have some ointment if you need it.

10:22.340 --> 10:23.880
Please read the next query.

10:24.340 --> 10:25.960
Okay.

10:26.720 --> 10:30.290
Beck and Jade, your query is:

10:30.320 --> 10:32.420
You're stranded on a boat in the ocean...

10:32.460 --> 10:35.090
- I don't go in the ocean.
- Just let him finish the question.

10:35.130 --> 10:37.100
- I don't like the ocean.
- Guys...

10:37.130 --> 10:40.800
We are trying to help our
friend with his game show.

10:40.830 --> 10:43.170
You know what happened to me
when I was in third grade.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.500
And went into the ocean!

10:44.540 --> 10:47.840
The dolphin was just being friendly!

10:47.870 --> 10:49.110
I love dolphins!

10:49.140 --> 10:53.440
They eat fish and do tricks, and I saw
one in a movie that solves crime.

10:53.480 --> 10:56.650
Oh, yeah.
What was the name of that movie?

10:56.680 --> 10:58.920
- Detective blowhole.
- Oh, yeah!

11:02.520 --> 11:06.220
I'm trying to ask Beck and Jade a query!

11:07.290 --> 11:10.290
Dolphins creep me out,
so I will not go in the ocean!

11:10.330 --> 11:12.560
- Just say a, b or c!!!
- B!

11:12.600 --> 11:14.260
- Maybe it was a!
- I don't care!

11:14.300 --> 11:16.580
I'm not happy with our relationship!

11:20.310 --> 11:22.910
We'll be right back with more
of queries for couples.

11:23.930 --> 11:26.810
- Starring Trina!
- Stop it!!!

11:27.410 --> 11:29.520
Hello? Tori?

11:29.550 --> 11:31.550
Do you want the ointment or the foam?

11:31.590 --> 11:33.150
Ointment!

11:33.190 --> 11:34.690
Wait, they have foam?

11:52.280 --> 11:54.490
What's up, girlfriend?

11:55.910 --> 11:57.700
Stop pretending we're couple.

11:57.720 --> 12:01.620
The game show is over.

12:02.940 --> 12:05.630
I don't know if you wanna begining
snippy with your pretended boyfriend,

12:05.660 --> 12:08.430
who fixed your pear phone source to work
without an extension cord?

12:08.500 --> 12:09.920
- You fixed it?
- Yup?

12:09.980 --> 12:12.240
Your mobile phone is once again...

12:13.710 --> 12:15.700
Mobile.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.960
Wh... wh... what is this?

12:20.130 --> 12:22.300
Car batteries. From a Volvo.

12:23.870 --> 12:27.010
So I am supposed to walk around
with these giant car batteries

12:27.040 --> 12:28.700
to power my phone?!

12:28.740 --> 12:32.040
Or you could just buy a new pear
phone GX to replace that one.

12:32.070 --> 12:33.210
Nooooo.

12:33.240 --> 12:34.480
If I buy another GX,

12:34.510 --> 12:37.810
I guarantee you the new XT'll
gonna come out like the next day,

12:37.850 --> 12:40.050
and then I'll be the dumb preturd with a GX.

12:40.080 --> 12:43.220
While everybody else has the cool new XT.

12:44.590 --> 12:48.920
- Take it easy, baby.
- Robbie...

12:48.960 --> 12:52.030
- Hey, Tori.
- Hey... sinji...

12:52.060 --> 12:53.930
Sinjin, what happened to you?!

12:53.960 --> 12:54.960
Well...

12:55.000 --> 12:56.930
After the show last night,
I went to the parking lot.

12:56.970 --> 13:00.400
To give Beck and Jade their trophy
for being voted worst couple,

13:00.440 --> 13:02.940
and Jade ran over me.

13:02.970 --> 13:04.510
She ran over you?!

13:04.540 --> 13:07.210
Just my legs.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.910
Will you give this to Beck or Jade?

13:08.950 --> 13:10.550
Sure.

13:10.580 --> 13:14.920
So is that goobensteen guy gonna
put your game show on his website?

13:14.950 --> 13:16.920
- I'm not sure.
- Well, what'd he say?

13:16.950 --> 13:19.530
Nothing... he just spit
in my apple juice.

13:20.390 --> 13:24.790
- That's not a good sign.
- Hard to say.

13:24.830 --> 13:29.360
- Ooo, there's Beck and Jade.
- No, not Jade.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.070
Aah!

13:31.100 --> 13:36.970
Robbie, come drag me away!

13:43.050 --> 13:44.850
Just get another pear phone GX.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.320
I am waiting for the XT!

13:47.350 --> 13:50.080
- I'm done talking about it.
- No, we're not.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.820
He's kidnapping me!
You all see it!

13:51.850 --> 13:54.720
Kidnapper! Kidnapper! Let go!

13:54.760 --> 13:57.090
Kidnapper.

13:57.130 --> 13:58.830
- This is not funny.
- Right.

13:58.860 --> 14:01.530
What's funny is you freaking out
over a dumb game show.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.330
We were voted worst couple.

14:03.370 --> 14:06.530
And the other two couples
weren't even real couples.

14:07.370 --> 14:10.010
And one had Robbie in it.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.910
Why do you care
if we were voted worst couple?

14:11.940 --> 14:13.940
It's a matter of...

14:13.980 --> 14:17.250
Is this a closet party?

14:17.280 --> 14:19.150
Look, I have spoons!

14:19.180 --> 14:20.580
Cat, come here.

14:20.620 --> 14:22.420
We need your opinion on something.

14:22.450 --> 14:25.390
On global warming?

14:25.420 --> 14:28.490
- No.
- 'Cuz I don't think that's really happening.

14:28.530 --> 14:29.390
Cat...

14:29.430 --> 14:31.860
Seriously, I went to the
movies the other night,

14:31.900 --> 14:34.330
and it was so cold.

14:34.370 --> 14:36.200
- Cat!
- Hi.

14:36.230 --> 14:39.200
- We need your opinion on us.
- Why not just ask a monkey?

14:39.240 --> 14:41.000
I saw a movie about a monkey.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.010
He wore glasses and carried a gun.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.640
Don't you think Jade and I fight a lot?

14:46.680 --> 14:47.310
Sure.

14:47.350 --> 14:51.050
Yeah, but all boyfriends and
girlfriends fight a lot, don't they?

14:51.080 --> 14:51.950
Well, sometimes, but...

14:51.980 --> 14:53.220
- Yes or no?!
- Ah!

14:53.250 --> 14:55.280
- Let her talk!
- You never listen to me talk!

14:55.320 --> 14:56.720
- Can I go now?
- No!

14:56.750 --> 14:57.850
What is your point here anyway?!

14:57.890 --> 14:59.950
I would like to have
a girlfriend I can talk to.

14:59.990 --> 15:01.720
Without it turning into a screaming match.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.860
Yeah?
Well I'd like a boyfriend.

15:02.890 --> 15:04.830
Who other girls don't stare at
all the time!

15:04.860 --> 15:08.400
I thought this was a closet party.

15:08.430 --> 15:10.570
How is it my fault girls stare at me?

15:10.600 --> 15:14.000
You could look worse if you wanted to!

15:14.040 --> 15:17.670
I'm under my bed, I'm under
my bed, I'm under my bed.

15:17.710 --> 15:19.740
I can't believe how jealous you get!

15:19.780 --> 15:22.010
Oh, oh, so you think I'm ugly?!

15:22.050 --> 15:25.820
Wh... ?! Who said...
Did I say she was ugly?!

15:25.850 --> 15:27.420
No, Cat thinks we're a perfect couple!

15:27.450 --> 15:29.090
Cat, are Jade and I a perfect couple?!

15:29.120 --> 15:30.450
- Don't answer that!
- Answer it!

15:30.490 --> 15:31.650
- Say nothing!
- C'mon!!!

15:31.690 --> 15:35.020
You c'mon?!?!

15:35.060 --> 15:37.930
Well, ya made Cat faint.

15:37.960 --> 15:41.030
I'm late for class.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.070
We're gonna have
to finish this sooner or later!

15:43.100 --> 15:45.030
Later.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.250
Hi.

15:52.810 --> 15:56.070
Hey Luther... somebody spilled a
soda on the floor in the gym and I...

16:00.290 --> 16:02.770
Oh Luther, why?

16:13.200 --> 16:15.130
I'll call it.

16:15.170 --> 16:17.600
...Full boat...
Jacks over queens.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.540
- I win!
- Boo.

16:19.570 --> 16:20.400
C'mon now...

16:20.440 --> 16:23.840
Ah, don't hate me
'cuz I'm lucky and pretty.

16:23.870 --> 16:27.130
Then can we hate you 'cuz you're
conceited and untalented?

16:28.650 --> 16:32.180
You guys, I feel bad that we didn't
invite Beck to play cards with us.

16:32.220 --> 16:34.150
You invite Beck, you get Jade too.

16:34.190 --> 16:35.520
And they're always fighting.

16:35.550 --> 16:37.120
I don't wanna be sitting here
playing cards.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.560
While they scream at each other.

16:38.590 --> 16:41.460
All right ladies...
Are we gonna chitchat or play some cards?

16:41.490 --> 16:42.830
- Cards.
- Let's play.

16:42.860 --> 16:43.860
- Deal 'em.
- Let's do it.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.560
Oh, wait, one sec...

16:47.670 --> 16:53.110
Looooooooo-woooooaaahhhhhh!!!

16:54.450 --> 16:55.770
Who was it?

16:57.310 --> 16:58.640
I don't know!

16:58.680 --> 17:02.750
I was too busy being electrocuted to hear!

17:02.780 --> 17:07.520
The worst those batteries
could give you is a mild shock.

17:07.550 --> 17:13.220
Ahhh! Take it away!
Take it away! Take it away!

17:13.260 --> 17:15.690
Just buy yourself another pear phone GX.

17:15.730 --> 17:19.530
No! If I buy another GX...
They're gonna announce the XT the next day.

17:19.569 --> 17:21.260
And then everyone will have a new XT.

17:21.300 --> 17:24.240
And I'll be stuck with a stupid GX.

17:24.270 --> 17:27.740
Man, I'm so sick of hearing that.

17:27.770 --> 17:30.940
Well, there's no need for you
guys to mock me simultaneously.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.250
- Is it my turn to deal?
- Yup. Do it.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.450
Okay, look...

17:36.480 --> 17:39.390
My Uncle Duke taught me how to
shuffle cards with one hand. Ready?

17:39.420 --> 17:40.520
Look-it...

17:40.560 --> 17:42.250
Schlamozzle!

17:45.960 --> 17:49.960
- I got it.
- Yeah, get it.

17:52.970 --> 17:54.970
Comiiiing.

17:57.400 --> 18:01.170
Oh. Great! It's you guys...

18:01.210 --> 18:03.270
See? They're all here.

18:03.310 --> 18:05.980
I told you they'd all be here.

18:06.010 --> 18:09.980
Listen, I am sorry that we didn't
invite you guys to play but...

18:10.020 --> 18:12.780
Tell her why you didn't invite us to play.

18:12.820 --> 18:17.890
Well... 'Cuz... we were...

18:17.920 --> 18:22.360
Planning your surprise party?

18:22.390 --> 18:23.490
What?

18:23.530 --> 18:26.400
Alright, we didn't invite you guys to play.

18:26.430 --> 18:28.670
Because you two are always
screamin' at each other.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.470
And it makes everybody feel awkward.

18:30.500 --> 18:34.240
And makes Cat faint and
sometimes it makes Robbie cry!

18:34.270 --> 18:36.870
One time! I cried one time!

18:36.910 --> 18:39.740
- Six.
- Six times!

18:39.780 --> 18:41.440
See?
We fight so much,

18:41.480 --> 18:44.050
even our friends don't want us around!

18:44.080 --> 18:46.450
Tori's not my friend.
I only tolerate Robbie.

18:46.480 --> 18:50.450
No one likes Trina.
And Cat's basically a pet.

18:50.490 --> 18:51.650
Arf!

18:53.560 --> 18:56.530
Are you guys gonna let her
say that nobody likes me?

19:01.170 --> 19:06.100
So why don't you guys play cards with us?

19:06.140 --> 19:07.640
Look, I don't wanna be your boyfriend.

19:07.670 --> 19:09.240
If we're just gonna fight all the time.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.370
So you wanna break up?

19:10.410 --> 19:12.940
No, I didn't say that! I'm just saying...

19:12.980 --> 19:14.850
You guys might break up?

19:14.880 --> 19:16.480
Because I'm not dating anyone.

19:16.520 --> 19:20.320
And I've always thought that Beck
and I would make a perfect...

19:20.350 --> 19:23.390
Next time it's a hammer!

19:23.420 --> 19:26.320
Come on, Beck, take me to get some food.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.200
I'm tired of fighting.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.400
Okay.

19:31.430 --> 19:32.870
I'm gonna walk out that door...

19:32.900 --> 19:36.420
- And I'm gonna count to ten.
- Don't forget three!

19:38.270 --> 19:41.140
Some people forget it.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.380
If I get to ten and you're not out there...

19:43.410 --> 19:44.910
I'm going home...

19:44.950 --> 19:47.580
And we're over.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.820
One...

19:49.850 --> 19:52.190
I would never fight with you.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.440
Two... three...

19:59.030 --> 20:04.660
Four... five...

20:04.700 --> 20:05.660
Six...

20:05.700 --> 20:07.470
- Yaww!
- Aah!

20:07.500 --> 20:08.870
- Trina!
- Stop.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.100
Come on.
Just give me a chance!

20:10.140 --> 20:12.410
Stop! Get off! No!

20:12.440 --> 20:15.170
You have to understand,
I'm a really fun girl!

20:15.210 --> 20:16.710
You're so good looking!

20:16.750 --> 20:21.480
What are you doing?!
Stop, stop.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.670
Seven...

20:24.530 --> 20:25.680
Eight...

20:29.260 --> 20:30.430
Nine...

20:32.760 --> 20:34.630
Ten.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.110
Let's play some cards.

20:59.140 --> 21:03.120
Yeah, let's play.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.590
I'll pick up the cards.

21:05.630 --> 21:08.760
- Make sure you get all fifty-two.
- Kay-kay.

21:08.800 --> 21:13.930
One... two... four... five...

21:13.970 --> 21:17.200
Six... seven... eight...

21:17.240 --> 21:21.480
Nine... ten... eleven...

21:33.590 --> 21:37.890
And... text message sent.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.630
Where's the battery card I made you?

21:39.660 --> 21:40.430
Don't need it.

21:40.460 --> 21:43.260
I went to the pear store
and just bought another GX.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.160
Good.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.970
I thought you're gonna wait for the new XT.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.140
Oh, who knows when that phone
will come out?

21:48.170 --> 21:49.500
I mean, it could be months.

21:49.540 --> 21:50.710
- True.
- You're right.

21:50.740 --> 21:53.780
Y'know, I needed a new phone
now and the GX is fine.

21:53.810 --> 21:58.110
And look, I already installed
talking Reggie.

21:58.150 --> 22:04.050
- Yo, what-up rejayyy?
- Yo, what-up rejayyy?

22:04.090 --> 22:07.620
Hey, you guys... did you see Jade
and Beck's profiles on The Slap?

22:07.660 --> 22:09.130
- I did.
- Yup.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.900
- What do they say?
- "Not in a relationship".

22:11.930 --> 22:14.100
Wow.

22:14.130 --> 22:17.780
Then I guess it's official.
They're broken up.

22:21.140 --> 22:24.070
Does my thumb look Spanish?

22:25.380 --> 22:28.080
Hey!
Look what I got, everyone!

22:28.110 --> 22:32.420
- The new pear phone XT?
- Yup!

22:32.450 --> 22:34.220
What?!

22:34.260 --> 22:38.220
No no no no noooo!!!

22:38.260 --> 22:40.930
- Uh-huh... they just hit the
pear store this morning.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.460
I got one too!

22:43.500 --> 22:44.330
Same here.

22:44.370 --> 22:45.630
- Uh-huh.
- I got one.

22:45.670 --> 22:47.700
I got a blue one!

22:47.740 --> 22:51.870
With unlimited texting.

22:51.910 --> 22:54.740
Dog jam it!!!

22:56.180 --> 22:58.310
- Buh-bye!
- Buh-bye!

22:58.350 --> 23:02.110
- Ooh!
- Ooh.
