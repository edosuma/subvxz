01:15.534 --> 01:17.116
I'm outside, roger.

01:19.162 --> 01:22.280
Mayday! Kuwaiti Star here!

01:22.833 --> 01:25.074
Your bogey, 20 right, 35. Over.

01:27.671 --> 01:30.880
No joy.
Keep bogey dope coming. Over.

01:31.049 --> 01:34.758
Target 306, platform. State 5.0.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.263
Target tanker, what's your posit?

01:36.263 --> 01:38.755
This is tanker Kuwaiti Star.
Mayday!

01:38.765 --> 01:42.258
Can anybody hear us? Please, answer!

01:42.269 --> 01:44.385
- Sir.
- This is tanker Kuwaiti Star!

01:44.396 --> 01:47.013
Kuwaiti Star, this is United
States warship Yankee Bravo.

01:47.023 --> 01:48.275
What is your situation, over?

01:48.275 --> 01:51.563
We have been attacked! Five wounded.
Please, come now!

01:52.821 --> 01:55.279
Roger, Kuwaiti Star.
This is United States Navy helo

01:55.282 --> 01:57.523
approaching your position.
Stand by, over.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.491
Yankee Bravo, this is Nightingale 501.

01:59.494 --> 02:01.485
We have visual contact
with the burning tanker.

02:01.496 --> 02:05.034
Bearing 209. Range, two miles.

02:05.041 --> 02:09.251
Have established radio communication.
ETA one minute.

02:09.253 --> 02:11.746
Roger, 01. Continue inbound.
Be careful.

02:14.509 --> 02:15.761
Get the TAO in here.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.553
Yankee Bravo. Nightingale 501.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.218
We have reached Kuwaiti Star's position.
Circling tanker.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.341
It is on fire and adrift, over.

02:24.352 --> 02:27.936
Roger, 01. Stand by.
Gunship is en route your sector. Over.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.644
We cannot wait!

02:30.650 --> 02:33.358
We are about to explode
and we have five men wounded!

02:33.361 --> 02:35.523
Yankee Bravo,
don't think we can wait.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.237
Request permission to go in.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.323
We are carrying high-grade fuel!
We are going to explode!

02:40.327 --> 02:41.488
All right.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.361
Roger, 01. Watch yourself.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.203
Kuwaiti Star, stand by.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.993
We're coming in on your port side.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.161
Thank you.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.911
Okay, we move all the crew to port side
for you to pick up. Thank you.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.163
Okay, Kuwaiti Star, this is US Navy helo.

02:54.174 --> 02:58.839
Kuwaiti Star, we're moving into position
to lower a diver onto your deck.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.713
It'd be a big help if you could keep an area
clear in front of the bridge for us. Over.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.682
We're running 2K over the bridge,
and I'll go in on the port side.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.471
We got a gunboat on our starboard side!

03:07.479 --> 03:08.844
I got him here.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.357
Unidentified gunboat,

03:10.357 --> 03:12.098
I am an United States Navy helicopter,

03:12.108 --> 03:13.769
here to take off wounded from the tanker.

03:13.777 --> 03:17.145
I am unarmed in international waters.
What are your intentions? Over.

03:19.407 --> 03:22.536
No! Webb's hit! Webb's hit!

03:22.536 --> 03:25.574
- Webb!
- Yankee Bravo, we're taking gunfire!

03:25.580 --> 03:27.696
Tell them to get the hell out of there.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.493
Nightingale 01, get out of there!

03:32.128 --> 03:34.540
Gunship, cease fire! Cease fire!

03:34.548 --> 03:37.916
Yankee Bravo, this is 501!
They got our tail rotor!

03:37.926 --> 03:40.714
- We're going to...
-01, get out of there!

03:40.720 --> 03:43.337
The helicopter has been hit!
The helicopter has been hit!

03:43.348 --> 03:45.931
Nightingale 01, this is Yankee Bravo.
Come in.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.855
Come in, 01.

03:49.855 --> 03:56.227
Nightingale 01, this is Yankee Bravo.
Come in.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.023
Come in, 01.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.189
Where the fuck am I?

05:05.305 --> 05:08.468
Hawkins! Where's Graham?

05:08.475 --> 05:09.761
Who cares?

05:11.102 --> 05:13.560
He's getting married in 30 minutes.

05:16.524 --> 05:19.141
- Hey, there you are.
- Hey.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.652
How are you doing?

05:26.660 --> 05:28.617
I don't know, man.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.322
Stopped drinking
and started thinking.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.041
Shouldn't have done that.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.708
I don't know if I
can do this thing, Jim.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.706
Come on, Graham.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.550
I'll be there, right by your side.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.885
We'll do this thing together.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.389
What do you mean "we", paleface?

05:53.853 --> 05:56.311
- I gotta get dressed.
- All right, man.

06:01.653 --> 06:04.736
Lighten up, Chief.
The best is all ahead of you.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.070
Like what?

06:06.074 --> 06:09.192
Marriage, children, a commitment.
That's what's important.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.159
It's too horrible to even think about.

06:11.162 --> 06:13.415
Look, I have a commitment,
to the teams.

06:13.415 --> 06:16.077
Yeah, well, the teams
aren't gonna last forever.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.870
Then what are you gonna come home to?

06:17.877 --> 06:21.996
A fridge full of beer and an address book
full of phone numbers, that's what.

06:22.007 --> 06:26.126
Coming from a guy whose marriage
lasted all of what, a year and a half?

06:26.136 --> 06:28.377
You should consider the source.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.720
Is this really what you wanna do, Billy?

06:30.724 --> 06:33.842
Yeah. Hell, I guess so.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.344
You guess so. Well, that's beautiful.

06:37.605 --> 06:43.317
Well, I'm sorry, guys, but I cannot be
a part of this funeral procession.

06:43.319 --> 06:46.778
See you later!

06:50.410 --> 06:52.526
He's a crazy motherfucker!

06:53.788 --> 06:56.871
- I hope he dies of pneumonia.
- Did you see that shit?

07:02.130 --> 07:03.416
Thank you!

07:13.933 --> 07:17.892
What the hell am I doing?
I hardly know this woman.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.103
You've known her three years, Chief.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.629
We gotta go, now.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.476
- Sorry, honey. I gotta go.
- Now?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.144
This minute.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.984
This is some kind of joke, right?
I don't believe it.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.443
Sorry, Jo. Excuse me.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.824
I know this is bad timing.

08:10.824 --> 08:14.613
With you guys it's
always bad timing.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.610
I'll call you when I can.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.498
Close call, Chief!

08:26.506 --> 08:30.044
He was either born lucky
or unlucky. I can't figure which.

08:32.636 --> 08:34.469
- It's over?
- Never happened.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.883
That was quick.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.467
- What's going on?
- Balloon went up. Get in.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.147
Gentlemen, there's a God in heaven.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.063
You bastard!

10:12.946 --> 10:15.108
Leave him alone, you son of a bitch!

10:37.428 --> 10:40.136
- Clear!
- Clear!

10:40.139 --> 10:41.174
Clear!

10:43.476 --> 10:44.807
Real clear.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.231
Search team in.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.727
X-Ray, this is Bad Karma.
Objective secured.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.944
Bad Karma, X-Ray.
What is your situation? Over.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.940
Preparing to move. Three passengers.
On schedule. Primary LZ.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.862
-60 seconds.
- X-Ray, roger. Out.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.947
We're a SEAL team.
We're here to get you out.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.117
- I believe you.
-50 seconds.

11:11.296 --> 11:14.664
Bad guy-

11:15.758 --> 11:16.964
Good gUY-

11:17.885 --> 11:20.047
I want you to relax, okay?

11:21.889 --> 11:22.970
Hey, hey.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.637
- Clearing, gotta move.
- Twenty-five.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.776
We got a locked door over here.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.564
Hawkins, don't break...

11:38.948 --> 11:40.029
Damn!

11:45.580 --> 11:46.911
We got an unknown in here.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.539
We're compromised.
Everybody out, now!

11:52.795 --> 11:54.081
I got him.

11:58.343 --> 12:02.132
- What's he saying? What's he saying?
- He says he's an Egyptian sailor.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.880
- Take his fucking picture!
- All right. I got it.

12:06.017 --> 12:09.009
Bad guys thought he was a spy.
They beat the shit out of him.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.886
Egyptian sailor, my ass!

12:10.897 --> 12:14.140
I ought to smoke this
piece of shit right here.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.187
Hawkins! Damn it! Let's go!

12:33.878 --> 12:36.461
What was that shit at the door?

12:36.464 --> 12:37.954
Room service.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.598
- Where is he?
- Rooftop! Rooftop! Back of us!

13:33.146 --> 13:34.432
God? God?

13:34.439 --> 13:36.055
God here.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.808
God, we got a single shooter,
southeast tower.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.776
Yeah, I see him.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.411
Nice shot, but you got two more.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.126
Got nothing on starlight.
Switching to thermal.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.088
Okay.

14:02.717 --> 14:03.957
Hold on.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.720
- God, what's our status?
- They're not moving. You're clear.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.434
Let's move out.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.899
Get those men inside!

14:30.161 --> 14:31.526
We are meeting heavy resistance.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.404
What the fuck is this?
Fuck this soft target!

14:34.415 --> 14:36.372
They're coming out of
the fucking woodwork!

14:36.375 --> 14:38.503
Bad guys! Alley! To the rear!

14:38.836 --> 14:39.792
Fuck!

14:42.006 --> 14:44.543
Hang on! God damn it.
We're losing him.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.885
- We gotta get him out of here.
- Partying now!

14:50.848 --> 14:53.010
Come on, Dale. We gotta move!

14:53.726 --> 14:56.468
All units, we're cut
off from our primary LZ.

14:56.479 --> 14:59.346
Going to LZ Two. Repeat, going to LZ Two.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.473
Bad Karma, X-Ray. Roger.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.276
You're starting to piss me off.
Now cool out!

15:05.279 --> 15:08.271
I am cool.
You should see me when I'm hot.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.364
- Help me.
- Jimmy, let's go.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.860
- You gotta buy us some time.
- How much time do you want?

15:13.037 --> 15:15.449
Bird leaves at 0245. Be there or swim.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.163
We got more coming!

15:17.166 --> 15:18.748
Ramos, give me a hand.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.714
- Graham!
- Yo!

15:26.717 --> 15:27.969
Cover me!

15:37.311 --> 15:40.269
I hope these fuckers paid their gas bill.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.235
- Case of beer, Billy!
- You got it!

15:53.953 --> 15:55.694
Shit! Follow me!

17:06.233 --> 17:08.019
Why aren't they firing?

17:10.488 --> 17:12.650
That's why. Stingers.

17:13.866 --> 17:17.200
- Shit! Guided missiles?
- Jackpot.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.786
Bad Karma Leader, this is Bad Karma Two.
Do you copy? Over.

17:21.624 --> 17:22.864
Leader, this is Two. Do you copy?

17:24.919 --> 17:27.661
Leader, this is Two. Do you copy?

17:30.925 --> 17:32.882
- May I?
- What do you have in mind?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.008
Well,

17:35.888 --> 17:37.390
I'm gonna do this.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.515
Shit!

17:42.228 --> 17:43.434
And now,

17:46.440 --> 17:48.693
- I'm gonna do this.
- God damn it, Hawkins!

18:00.579 --> 18:02.741
- It didn't blow.
- No shit, sir!

18:09.255 --> 18:13.624
Behind those bags, cover. Take cover.
Let's set perimeters.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.171
X-Ray, Bad Karma.
We're extracting.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.884
Sniper on the wall!

18:23.769 --> 18:25.385
There's another one!

18:31.277 --> 18:33.689
Bad Karma, X-Ray coming in.
Take in five.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.319
- Come on! We gotta go!
- Where's Hawkins?

18:43.122 --> 18:46.240
Bad Karma, X-Ray grounded.
Load them up. Come on. Let's go!

18:46.250 --> 18:50.460
All right! Extract!
Everybody go! Go! Go!

18:50.463 --> 18:54.172
We just found an entire
warehouse full of missiles!

18:54.175 --> 18:55.791
- We gotta blow them!
- What?

18:55.801 --> 18:58.293
- Missiles!
- No! We're extracting!

18:58.304 --> 19:00.511
Give me the breaching charges!
I can handle it!

19:00.514 --> 19:02.505
- No! We're extracting now!
- I can handle it!

19:02.516 --> 19:05.349
No! Let's move out! Go!

19:05.519 --> 19:08.227
Units, let's go. Come on, let's move!

19:09.648 --> 19:11.230
Let's go!

19:12.651 --> 19:15.439
Come on! Move! In! In! In!

19:31.170 --> 19:34.583
Yankee Bravo, X-Ray.
Pickup complete. RTB. ETA 10 minutes.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.503
- How's he doing?
- I think he'll be okay.

19:37.510 --> 19:41.003
- Good.
- Lieutenant, I really...

19:41.013 --> 19:43.175
You guys are incredible. Thank you.

19:43.182 --> 19:47.050
There's no reason to thank us
because we don't exist.

19:47.061 --> 19:51.055
You never saw us. This never happened.

19:51.065 --> 19:53.898
Yankee Bravo, X-Ray. On final.
Tally-ho.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.017
One more thing.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.484
You're welcome.

19:59.114 --> 20:03.449
Yankee Bravo, X-Ray. Roger.
Steady 306. Needle's good on the ball.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.828
X-Ray to Bravo. Clear to land. Pad two.

20:23.722 --> 20:29.138
- Describe your method of entry.
- I came through a skylight.

20:29.144 --> 20:32.136
- And you had contact in the hallway?
- One confirmed.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.855
What was your action
at the objective area?

20:34.859 --> 20:38.227
I entered the room in the third position.
Swept left to right.

20:38.237 --> 20:42.071
- Did you fire your weapon?
- Fucking A, sir.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.408
- There were no other documents?
- I got everything in the room.

20:45.411 --> 20:48.403
- Everything?
- Everything but the onions.

20:48.414 --> 20:52.373
Crew chief was dead.
Copilot had serious internal injuries.

20:52.376 --> 20:56.085
I stabilized him, prepared to move.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.920
That's when the shit hit the fan.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.630
The primary LZ was aborted.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.216
I covered their movement
to the secondary.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.426
You engaged hostiles?

21:04.430 --> 21:06.922
I vaporized hostiles.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.845
Why did you decide to break
silence and blow the door?

21:09.852 --> 21:12.093
I thought I heard something.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.222
We all hear things, Lieutenant.
Some of us react differently.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.394
Some of us don't react at all.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.312
Why did you let this man go?

21:19.320 --> 21:21.106
I had a plane to catch.

21:27.161 --> 21:29.698
Can you tell us why you
elected not to go back in

21:29.705 --> 21:32.288
and blow up the missiles, Lieutenant?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.911
I had one dead and two wounded.

21:34.919 --> 21:37.411
I didn't have time to dick around.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.630
You consider searching for internationally
important munitions clicking around?

21:40.633 --> 21:43.500
Hey, don't point the finger at me

21:43.510 --> 21:48.095
about something you guys at intel
should've known about in the first place.

21:48.098 --> 21:50.476
By the way, thanks for the hot tip

21:50.476 --> 21:54.219
on the 100 assholes we
encountered at your soft target.

21:54.229 --> 21:55.936
Makes you wonder
why they call it intelligence.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.147
That'll be enough, Lieutenant.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.569
Hey, mail from the boat.

22:04.573 --> 22:07.656
Hey, LT, wanna lose
some of that combat pay?

22:07.660 --> 22:10.118
No. I'll keep my 60 bucks, thanks.

22:30.474 --> 22:33.387
Am I interrupting something?

22:33.394 --> 22:35.101
No. No.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.930
I thought you might
want to take a look at that.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.403
Could have used this a week ago.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.443
- Yeah, well, who knew?
- God damn.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.861
I am still jacked up.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.364
You wanna talk about a rush?
Fuck me!

22:57.126 --> 22:59.367
You wanna keep that
emotion under control.

22:59.378 --> 23:03.588
Yeah, but it's flowing through me, boss.
It's flowing right through me.

23:03.590 --> 23:07.800
That high is not the
one you're looking for.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.009
Believe me.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.267
End of lecture?

23:13.267 --> 23:15.224
Yeah, for now.

23:19.898 --> 23:23.482
You cannot invade our land
and talk about security.

23:24.236 --> 23:28.480
You cannot send soldiers into
our homes and talk about peace.

23:28.490 --> 23:33.200
You cannot kill a man's family
and talk about human rights.

23:33.370 --> 23:37.204
And you wage this war with acts
of terrorism against civilians.

23:37.207 --> 23:40.871
If America kills our people,
then our people will kill Americans.

23:41.045 --> 23:44.629
As in the bombing of the
Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983?

23:44.631 --> 23:47.089
In the reprisal for the
shelling of our homes

23:47.092 --> 23:50.881
and the murder of our
families by American warships.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.637
He's a real sweetheart, huh?

23:52.639 --> 23:55.768
- How does he fit in over there?
- Shaheed?

23:55.768 --> 23:58.100
He just emerged as leader of a group.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.935
- Al-Shuhada.
- Al-Shuhada.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.191
- Whatever.
- Who are they?

24:02.191 --> 24:04.057
They just put a new team in the field.

24:04.068 --> 24:05.524
We know next to nothing about them

24:05.527 --> 24:08.269
except we believe they're
connected to the Hezbollah.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.487
Jesus! We don't know much
about anything, do we?

24:10.491 --> 24:11.652
Who's that reporter?

24:11.658 --> 24:12.944
- Claire Verens?
- Yeah.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.409
- How come she's so knowledgeable?
- Well, she's half-Lebanese.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.653
She's got contacts over there
we couldn't even hope to have.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.871
She covered the Mideast
for the networks for five years.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.708
She's a reporter.
She's not gonna give us anything.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.870
What they've got is the
perfect terrorist weapon.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.246
Portable, hand-held.

24:27.257 --> 24:28.873
Jesus. What a mess.

24:29.051 --> 24:32.419
Those fanatics got a warehouse
full of these missiles.

24:35.641 --> 24:38.724
Why in the hell didn't you blow
those things when you had the chance?

24:38.727 --> 24:41.105
Sir, the lieutenant made
a decision under fire.

24:41.105 --> 24:43.096
And we stand behind that decision.

24:43.107 --> 24:45.018
Navy SEALs, they're paid to take risks.

24:45.025 --> 24:47.813
They're paid to get shot at,
they're paid to die if necessary.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.653
- Now, I take exception to that decision.
- Damn it, Warren.

24:50.656 --> 24:54.775
The point here is not what might
have been done, but what we do now.

25:00.791 --> 25:04.785
With due respect, sir,
let me take my team back in there.

25:04.795 --> 25:06.661
With my first-hand knowledge
of this Shaheed...

25:09.049 --> 25:10.915
That'll be up to the President.

25:10.926 --> 25:14.260
Now, we'll see if he wants to give
your SEALs another opportunity.

25:16.515 --> 25:20.349
Nobody's blaming the SEALs
and nobody is blaming you, Curran.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.559
Sir, I don't care about the blame.

25:22.563 --> 25:23.894
I care about the safety of my team

25:23.897 --> 25:25.638
and I care about
getting those Stingers back.

25:25.649 --> 25:26.935
The situation has changed.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.808
No one knows where in the
hell those missiles are.

25:28.819 --> 25:30.526
It's up to the
intelligence community now.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.315
It's out of our hands.
Completely out of our hands.

25:32.322 --> 25:35.189
- I don't accept that.
- It's out of your hands.

25:35.200 --> 25:39.034
You're an operator, not a policymaker.
Get used to it.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.204
I had him.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.868
I should have taken
him out when I had him.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.295
How do you know you
would have made it?

25:46.295 --> 25:49.583
I think more than likely you and
your team would have been waxed.

25:49.590 --> 25:52.582
Well, like the man says,
that's what we're paid to do.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.927
I want your team to
stand down for a while.

25:56.930 --> 26:00.514
Relax. Cool out. Get some
perspective on this, all right?

26:03.103 --> 26:05.060
Lieutenant?

26:05.063 --> 26:06.269
Aye, sir.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.686
Keep your head down, hotshot!

26:51.902 --> 26:53.063
Incoming!

27:55.048 --> 27:57.005
- Fellow cake-eater.
- Hotshot.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.001
- Brain grenade?
- Sure.

28:03.056 --> 28:05.172
What, are you still
thinking about bad guys?

28:05.183 --> 28:06.594
Yeah.

28:06.601 --> 28:09.969
- As a matter of fact, I am.
- It's old news, man.

28:09.980 --> 28:12.267
We go in there,
we hit them and forget them.

28:12.274 --> 28:14.015
It's what we do, right?

28:14.026 --> 28:15.687
There's more to it than that.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.228
Look, if you got a problem,
do something about it.

28:18.238 --> 28:20.730
You stick it out, then don't
be afraid to get it cut off.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.903
That's what I always say.

28:22.909 --> 28:25.571
You gotta get these emotions
under control, son.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.007
I need to know if
this is what you want.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.962
Jo, I want this.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.845
I love you and
I wanna marry you.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.261
And you... But you know who I am.

28:52.272 --> 28:55.481
- And you just gotta understand...
- I understand, I do.

28:55.484 --> 29:00.274
I know that you can be pulled away at
any time to go anywhere. I know that.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.772
If anybody knows that, I do.

29:02.783 --> 29:07.323
It's part of the package and
I'm in it for the long haul.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.158
I love you, Billy.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.754
Just let my man shoot here, okay?
Just take it easy. $50 on this.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.210
Wait a minute.

29:24.221 --> 29:27.259
That's my car. He's taking my car!

29:27.265 --> 29:32.476
Hey!

29:32.479 --> 29:35.437
That's what you get for
parking on the fairway, Hawkins!

29:35.440 --> 29:37.556
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

30:36.918 --> 30:38.079
Oh, shit!

31:02.277 --> 31:05.065
Okay, gentlemen. We're getting
another shot at those missiles.

31:05.906 --> 31:09.490
Satellite photos show them located in
a merchant vessel called the Latanya

31:09.743 --> 31:12.110
bound for Lebanon.

31:12.120 --> 31:16.114
The ship's packed with Muslim pilgrims,
which could present a hostage situation.

31:16.124 --> 31:19.537
- How many terrorists, sir?
- We don't know.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.502
So what do we do about
the hostage situation, sir?

31:22.506 --> 31:24.873
Avoid it. At all costs.

31:24.883 --> 31:28.421
That's right. The last thing
we want is an international incident.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.339
You know, the missiles
could be booby-trapped.

31:30.347 --> 31:33.635
So when you locate them,
call the bomb disposal group.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.724
Sounds like a real pleasure cruise.

31:35.727 --> 31:39.095
Your insertion platform is the USN Nayak,

31:39.105 --> 31:42.393
presently shadowing the Latanya
off the coast of Syria.

31:52.077 --> 31:55.069
- Captain.
- Well, here she is, gentlemen.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.582
Looks peaceful enough.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.503
Let's go swimming.

32:11.263 --> 32:15.427
The op's a go.
Equipment check in 30 mikes.

32:15.433 --> 32:18.391
All right, you heard the man.
Rock the box.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.559
Lockout chamber clear.

32:25.777 --> 32:26.892
Up! Up!

32:28.822 --> 32:29.903
Open it up.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.905
- Valve's open to the max.
- Water pressure?

37:17.110 --> 37:18.521
Ask him where the gunmen are.

37:21.531 --> 37:24.444
- Says there are none.
- Ask him about the missiles.

37:29.539 --> 37:30.745
Nothing.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.907
He's running out of time.

37:33.918 --> 37:36.876
What gunmen? What missiles?

37:36.880 --> 37:40.248
This is a merchant ship.
We're carrying machine parts.

37:42.969 --> 37:45.176
What the hell's going on here?

37:46.931 --> 37:48.717
We got the right ship.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.913
- What was that?
- Deal with him!

38:13.917 --> 38:15.783
Rexer! You stay.

38:17.921 --> 38:20.162
Leader, this is Two.
Be advised, we've had an explosion.

38:20.173 --> 38:21.459
What kind of explosion?

38:27.138 --> 38:29.300
Hawkins, what's your status?

38:29.307 --> 38:31.423
- Hawkins, talk to me!
- Hold on.

38:33.895 --> 38:36.978
- What's he saying?
- Something about your mother.

38:41.861 --> 38:44.148
Never talk about Mom.

38:46.866 --> 38:51.326
- What's this?
- Looks like a dead terrorist to me, boss.

38:51.329 --> 38:54.538
- What happened?
- Capped a bad guy down in the hold.

38:54.540 --> 38:56.326
Looks like he fell
on his own booby trap.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.167
Okay. Round everybody up, pat
them down. Let's get EOD in here.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.581
You got it.

39:33.037 --> 39:36.029
I've got nine crates
in the forward hold!

39:49.679 --> 39:52.171
Lieutenant, I think
you boys have been had.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.685
No shit.

40:01.441 --> 40:03.808
True Islam does
not preach terrorism.

40:04.610 --> 40:08.194
True Islam is one of the most
tolerant of the world's religions,

40:08.197 --> 40:11.565
accepting Christians and Jews
as people of the same God.

40:13.619 --> 40:17.453
True Islam also preaches
equality and justice.

40:17.457 --> 40:21.041
The Shiite Muslims of Lebanon
have seen little of either.

40:22.086 --> 40:26.000
Fourteen years of
devastating civil war

40:26.007 --> 40:29.750
have given rise to small but
militant groups of fundamentalists

40:29.761 --> 40:33.345
who believe the very survival
of their faith is at stake.

40:34.307 --> 40:36.218
And then tolerance fades

40:37.185 --> 40:39.802
and faith turns to anger.

40:39.979 --> 40:43.563
For the Al-Shuhada of Lebanon,
it's turned to absolute rage.

40:44.317 --> 40:46.103
- Perfect.
- G reat.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.566
Okay, that's it.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.818
I wanted to ask you
a couple of questions.

40:52.825 --> 40:53.906
I'm interested in your work

40:53.910 --> 40:57.995
and I thought I might be able to look
at some of your research material.

40:59.832 --> 41:02.244
Who are you?
Who do you represent?

41:04.212 --> 41:07.671
My name is James Curran.
I don't represent anyone.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.632
I'm in the Navy.

41:10.635 --> 41:12.592
And what do you do for the Navy?

41:13.971 --> 41:15.507
I'm with the teams.

41:16.724 --> 41:20.058
- A SEAL, huh?
- That's right.

41:20.061 --> 41:22.018
Okay. Let's have lunch.

41:24.690 --> 41:27.853
Why do you keep going
back to the Al-Shuhada?

41:28.027 --> 41:30.860
Is there something special
about this group that interests you?

41:30.863 --> 41:31.853
No.

41:32.949 --> 41:37.819
You know, I don't think we're having
a Mideast current affairs lesson here.

41:37.829 --> 41:41.197
I think we're talking about missiles.

41:41.207 --> 41:42.447
Missiles?

41:44.544 --> 41:47.206
Why the hell do you
think I'm sitting here?

41:47.213 --> 41:49.420
Because I have strong
contacts who are telling me

41:49.423 --> 41:51.551
that US missiles have somehow
found their way there.

41:51.551 --> 41:55.089
Now I have a Navy SEAL
asking me questions about Shaheed.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.506
You're telling me the Al-Shuhada
has gotten their hands on US missiles?

41:59.517 --> 42:00.678
No, you're telling me.

42:00.685 --> 42:03.017
- I didn't say anything.
- Me neither.

42:06.232 --> 42:09.190
Come on, Lieutenant.
What are the SEALs up to?

42:10.278 --> 42:12.485
Nothing special. Training.

42:13.573 --> 42:15.189
May I take a look?

42:17.243 --> 42:18.324
Sure.

42:29.881 --> 42:32.543
Only about 10% will make it.

42:32.550 --> 42:35.338
For these guys,
it's all about endurance.

43:32.944 --> 43:35.231
All that and a paycheck, too?

43:36.739 --> 43:39.356
A very small one.

43:39.367 --> 43:42.029
- These guys, they don't do it for money.
- What?

43:42.036 --> 43:45.404
- They don't do it for money.
- Then why do they do it?

43:48.084 --> 43:50.701
I guess we're all trying to
prove something to ourselves.

43:52.088 --> 43:55.001
It's called a dive tower.

43:55.007 --> 43:56.589
What are they doing exactly?

43:56.592 --> 44:00.301
They're simulating planting
explosives on a ship's hull.

44:00.304 --> 44:03.638
So you really think they're
keeping the missiles on a ship?

44:03.641 --> 44:05.723
This is normal training, Claire.

44:05.726 --> 44:09.594
Lieutenant Scott, you have
a telephone call on line three.

44:09.605 --> 44:12.814
- That's normal?
- No, that's abnormal.

44:12.817 --> 44:15.855
That's Hawkins.
He's part fish.

44:15.861 --> 44:17.238
I think we'd better
get out of here

44:17.238 --> 44:19.525
before he presses something
else up against the window.

44:26.414 --> 44:30.328
- You ever had any Mideast assignments?
- Beirut.

44:30.334 --> 44:33.417
- When?
-'83, '84.

44:34.380 --> 44:37.918
So you were there during the
bombing of the Marine barracks?

44:37.925 --> 44:40.667
Yeah, I was there, all right.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.965
Lost a couple of
good friends that day.

44:45.182 --> 44:46.388
So what about it?

44:46.392 --> 44:48.850
Are you gonna tell me what I wanna
know about the missiles or not?

44:48.853 --> 44:52.096
You don't seem to understand, Lieutenant.
I'm a journalist, not a spy.

44:54.025 --> 44:55.982
What's this, the Officers' Club?

44:56.777 --> 44:57.767
No.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.361
We call this the kill house.

45:02.241 --> 45:04.573
We use it for CQB.

45:04.577 --> 45:06.409
Close-quarters battle.

45:08.122 --> 45:09.658
Sounds like fun.

45:11.375 --> 45:12.581
It is.

45:22.970 --> 45:25.632
- Clear!
- Clear!

45:28.768 --> 45:29.849
Thanks.

45:34.607 --> 45:37.395
She's not upset,
is she, Lieutenant?

45:37.568 --> 45:38.729
Sweet!

45:44.241 --> 45:46.198
Hey, hey, hey-

45:47.161 --> 45:49.118
What the hell was that about?

45:49.121 --> 45:50.737
It's about being in
the middle of a war

45:50.748 --> 45:53.080
and not being able to
do a damn thing about it!

45:54.126 --> 45:57.460
You know he's got the missiles.
I know he's got the missiles.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.295
Now, what are we
gonna do about it?

45:59.298 --> 46:01.585
- Are the SEALs going after him?
- If we can find him.

46:01.592 --> 46:03.094
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

46:03.094 --> 46:04.334
Who does?

46:10.643 --> 46:13.726
I don't know.
I don't know what I can tell you.

46:32.623 --> 46:34.830
Good evening, sir.

46:34.834 --> 46:36.416
Welcome to ll Giardino.

46:37.169 --> 46:38.955
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

46:39.797 --> 46:42.255
In the Fireplace Room.
Right this way.

46:43.300 --> 46:46.588
- Hey, Hawk. How you doing?
- Hi, Ruth. How you doing?

46:50.224 --> 46:52.636
I'm just gonna borrow your phone.

46:52.643 --> 46:55.101
- Right this way, please.
- Great. Thanks.

46:58.315 --> 47:01.182
Yes, can I have the
Command Duty Officer, please?

47:01.360 --> 47:02.646
Thank you.

47:03.195 --> 47:05.027
Yeah, this is Captain Dunne.

47:05.030 --> 47:08.443
Beep Lieutenant Curran immediately.

47:08.451 --> 47:09.816
Right away.

47:13.456 --> 47:15.823
And you made your home
in the Navy, right?

47:16.834 --> 47:19.201
Not necessarily. How about you?

47:19.211 --> 47:21.953
Hi, girls.
What's happening?

47:21.964 --> 47:24.126
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

47:24.133 --> 47:26.841
There's a familiar face.
How you doing? Dale Hawkins.

47:26.844 --> 47:28.551
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

47:28.554 --> 47:30.966
This is Claire Verens.
She's a journalist.

47:30.973 --> 47:33.965
- She specializes in the Middle East.
- Well, Beirut, really.

47:33.976 --> 47:36.343
One of my favorite spots.

47:36.353 --> 47:37.969
What a shithole.

47:39.398 --> 47:42.186
- You been there?
- Are you kidding?

47:42.193 --> 47:45.151
Rags knocking each other off
like the national pastime.

47:45.154 --> 47:46.360
Rags?

47:47.281 --> 47:50.239
Ragheads. Arabs.

47:50.242 --> 47:53.576
I think they're all a few
sandwiches shy of a picnic.

47:53.579 --> 47:56.162
I happen to be half-rag myself.

47:56.165 --> 47:58.281
My mother's Lebanese.

47:58.292 --> 47:59.453
Is she?

48:01.086 --> 48:03.794
Well, I guess I've
done it again, haven't I?

48:03.797 --> 48:05.208
What's new?

48:05.216 --> 48:06.706
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

48:07.927 --> 48:09.838
I was just being me, you know?

48:11.013 --> 48:12.299
What's up?

48:14.058 --> 48:16.390
I've gotta leave.
I'm sorry.

48:16.393 --> 48:20.637
- Can I give you a call?
- Yeah, sure. That's fine.

48:20.648 --> 48:23.231
- Can you give her a ride home?
- Gladly.

48:24.777 --> 48:26.233
I'll be fine.

48:29.323 --> 48:31.280
We'll see you around, boss.

48:33.619 --> 48:36.611
So, where were we?

48:36.622 --> 48:40.411
Well, I was insulting your heritage,
and now we're having dinner.

48:40.417 --> 48:42.033
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

48:48.175 --> 48:51.839
So I guess growing up in the wetback
section of Fresno wasn't that bad.

48:51.845 --> 48:53.882
- It was...
- You mean Mexican?

48:54.557 --> 48:57.925
Wet... Depends if they're
working for you or not.

48:57.935 --> 49:00.643
You're gonna actually make me
think before I talk, aren't you?

49:00.646 --> 49:02.728
I'm sure that'll be a first.

49:02.731 --> 49:05.849
Anyways, my mom taught
school and my dad,

49:06.026 --> 49:09.314
when he did work, he used
to supervise fruit pickers.

49:09.321 --> 49:14.236
He had to drive around the fields
in a golf cart 'cause a Jap...

49:14.243 --> 49:19.329
...anese mine blew both of his feet off,
so he couldn't get around too well.

49:19.331 --> 49:23.871
He's a good guy, but he thinks I'm nuts
for being a full-time frogman.

49:41.228 --> 49:42.935
What are we doing?

49:42.938 --> 49:46.351
Well, hopefully each other,
if all goes as planned.

49:50.863 --> 49:54.481
You don't like these guys?
Well, me neither.

49:54.491 --> 49:56.949
So, you got a favorite tune?

49:56.952 --> 50:01.492
Yeah. Do you know "Turn the car
around and take me to my hotel"?

50:01.498 --> 50:05.617
What's wrong? Look, we got
a beautiful ocean, we got the moon,

50:05.628 --> 50:08.370
we got two people strongly
attracted to each other.

50:08.380 --> 50:10.291
Two?

50:10.299 --> 50:12.461
Well, one out of
two ain't bad, huh?

50:15.471 --> 50:16.677
See you.

50:16.680 --> 50:21.015
Wait a minute. Claire.
Come on. Claire! Hey!

50:21.018 --> 50:22.725
Wait a minute.
Come here.

50:22.728 --> 50:28.019
Now, look. You're a vaguely
amusing and not unattractive guy,

50:28.025 --> 50:30.562
but I'm not even remotely interested.

50:30.569 --> 50:34.688
And if you don't take me to my hotel,
that means I have to walk.

50:34.698 --> 50:38.692
So I guess the weekend in Bora Bora
is out of the question, right?

50:41.955 --> 50:43.161
Come on.

51:09.650 --> 51:11.311
- Nice move.
- What's the matter with you?

51:11.485 --> 51:13.726
- What's the matter with you?
- What kind of bullshit was that?

51:13.737 --> 51:15.944
Hey, trust me with your life
but not your money or your wife.

51:15.948 --> 51:17.438
You're an asshole!

51:17.449 --> 51:20.692
What is up with you?
Am I missing something here?

51:20.703 --> 51:23.365
- Yeah, a lot.
- Why don't you fill me in?

51:26.208 --> 51:28.370
I told her about the Stingers.

51:28.877 --> 51:30.208
Shaheed.

51:31.755 --> 51:33.496
Well, that's great.

51:33.507 --> 51:35.669
Why the hell did you do that?

51:35.676 --> 51:37.132
Information.

51:37.136 --> 51:39.924
Who are you?
The goddamn CIA now?

51:39.930 --> 51:42.262
CIA's giving us nothing.

51:42.266 --> 51:44.428
They never have and they never will.

51:48.647 --> 51:50.388
She's all we've got.

51:53.819 --> 51:56.106
We've still got her,
don't we, Hawkins?

51:57.656 --> 52:00.444
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, she's still around. Sure.

52:00.951 --> 52:02.817
Help me out with this.

52:03.954 --> 52:05.865
Okay. You got me.

52:07.249 --> 52:09.741
All you had to do was say something.

52:13.547 --> 52:15.254
To recap our lead story,

52:15.257 --> 52:17.840
a private jet carrying an
Algerian negotiating committee

52:17.843 --> 52:21.177
was shot down this morning as
it left the airport in Madrid.

52:21.180 --> 52:23.342
Seven passengers and
two crewmen were killed.

52:23.348 --> 52:24.884
- What's up, skipper?
- Take a look at this.

52:24.892 --> 52:27.384
Eyewitnesses report the plane exploded
less than a minute after takeoff.

52:27.394 --> 52:29.886
Unconfirmed reports say
the weapon which downed the plane

52:29.897 --> 52:33.640
was an American-built,
hand-held missile called the Stinger.

52:33.650 --> 52:36.608
Two men believed responsible
for the attack were captured.

52:36.612 --> 52:38.228
Spanish police say
they have evidence

52:38.238 --> 52:41.481
that more attacks on
civilian aircraft are planned.

52:49.416 --> 52:51.453
Did you hear what happened?

52:51.460 --> 52:56.580
Your defender of religious faith just
blew a peace commission out of the sky.

52:56.590 --> 52:58.922
It's happening, Claire.

52:58.926 --> 53:02.965
Help us. Give me some information.
Something. Anything!

53:02.971 --> 53:04.962
Why can't you understand?

53:04.973 --> 53:07.840
I don't create the news.
I report it. I'm a journalist.

53:07.851 --> 53:10.138
- You're involved.
- I won't be an accomplice.

53:10.145 --> 53:13.479
Well, who are you helping by
not giving me any information?

53:17.903 --> 53:19.519
All right.

53:19.530 --> 53:23.239
Write your story. And the next one.

53:23.242 --> 53:25.574
And when the next plane is shot down,

53:25.577 --> 53:29.662
make sure you get the names and
ages of the innocent victims right.

53:33.460 --> 53:34.541
Okay.

53:36.588 --> 53:38.579
But I can't volunteer anything.

53:39.383 --> 53:43.342
You ask the questions and
I'll try and answer what I know.

53:44.721 --> 53:46.007
All right.

54:06.034 --> 54:07.695
I think I've got something.

54:07.703 --> 54:09.865
Walid Fahladi.

54:09.872 --> 54:13.661
Wasn't he with Shaheed's go-between
at the second meeting that you had in...

54:13.667 --> 54:15.328
- Balbec. Right.
- Balbec. Yeah, that's right.

54:15.335 --> 54:16.917
Right, right, right.
Now we're getting someplace.

54:16.920 --> 54:20.083
Except he dropped out
of sight six months ago.

54:20.090 --> 54:21.831
- What are you talking about?
- Disappeared.

54:21.842 --> 54:24.880
Kidnapping, probably.
Could've been the Israelis.

54:26.889 --> 54:28.471
Great.

54:28.473 --> 54:32.512
Now, that is the best goddamn
idea I've heard all day.

54:34.062 --> 54:36.895
- What?
- What you just said.

54:36.899 --> 54:38.105
What did I just say?

54:38.108 --> 54:39.143
Why don't we just go in there,

54:39.318 --> 54:41.901
grab one of these cheese-dicks
and make them talk?

54:42.070 --> 54:43.526
Sounds great.

54:45.782 --> 54:47.910
I don't think she's
taking us that seriously.

54:47.910 --> 54:49.492
What do you expect?

54:49.494 --> 54:52.577
I don't think you
understand the situation.

54:52.581 --> 54:56.620
These guys are religious zealots.
There's no way you could make them talk.

54:56.627 --> 54:58.368
You're dealing with extremists.

54:58.378 --> 55:01.211
- And you're dealing with the Navy SEALs.
- Oh, okay.

55:08.221 --> 55:11.634
All right. I've heard enough.
I've heard enough.

55:11.642 --> 55:13.474
I can assure you
that this administration

55:13.477 --> 55:15.969
will take no part in the
kidnapping of a foreign national.

55:15.979 --> 55:17.970
- Warren, hear him out.
- No.

55:17.981 --> 55:21.064
I appreciate your zeal in this matter,
Dick, but it's totally out of the question.

55:21.068 --> 55:23.526
Just a minute.
We know this guy.

55:23.528 --> 55:25.860
- You know him, Elliott?
- Yeah, he's a paid asset.

55:25.864 --> 55:27.946
We've bought information
from him in the past.

55:27.950 --> 55:29.566
I always thought he was a little fish.

55:29.576 --> 55:32.409
If this guy has any information,
why hasn't he contacted you already?

55:32.412 --> 55:35.200
He's probably scared shitless.

55:35.207 --> 55:38.541
But if we extract him and we
make it look like a kidnapping,

55:38.543 --> 55:41.456
I feel certain he'd sell
us anything he knows.

55:41.463 --> 55:43.545
Look, can we call this a defection?
I'm thinking...

55:43.548 --> 55:45.960
You can call it an immigration
if you want to, Jim.

55:45.968 --> 55:49.302
The point is, you give the
guy money, he jumps into bed.

55:53.976 --> 55:57.310
Warren, shall we continue to plan?

56:02.484 --> 56:05.021
All right.
I'll update the President.

56:09.116 --> 56:11.574
All right.
Let's go through it again.

56:11.576 --> 56:15.490
It may be the last chance with
this model, so go over it again.

56:17.749 --> 56:20.081
- Ramos.
- Street to south.

56:20.085 --> 56:22.543
- Graham.
- Street to the north.

56:22.546 --> 56:25.914
- Hawkins.
- Front door. First floor.

56:25.924 --> 56:28.962
- Dane.
- Side wall. Second floor secure.

56:30.679 --> 56:33.341
- Right. Rexer.
- Rear wall. Secure courtyard.

56:33.348 --> 56:35.180
All right, for those people on the street,

56:35.183 --> 56:37.345
if there's any trouble,
collapse on the house.

56:37.352 --> 56:39.389
Those inside, stay inside.

56:39.396 --> 56:41.979
We move out together, only together.

56:41.982 --> 56:45.225
Remember, there's only
one hostile, a bodyguard,

56:45.235 --> 56:47.727
so let's not hose down the place.

56:47.738 --> 56:50.105
I'd be happy if no shots were fired.

56:50.115 --> 56:51.776
So would he, I'm sure.

56:59.374 --> 57:02.787
- I want you to keep right on top of him.
- I'm sure it'll be okay.

57:02.794 --> 57:06.458
You're gonna be on Syrian and Israeli
radar the moment you take off.

57:06.465 --> 57:08.627
So you have to stay
in commercial airspace

57:08.633 --> 57:12.467
and jump from 12 miles
offshore and swim in.

57:12.471 --> 57:14.382
Assuming everything goes okay,

57:14.389 --> 57:17.552
the biggest thing to worry
about is the extraction.

57:17.559 --> 57:19.550
You'll be extracting in a Ribex.

57:19.561 --> 57:22.553
It'll be on radar the
moment it starts in.

57:22.564 --> 57:25.101
You only get one pass at it.

57:25.108 --> 57:27.224
If you're not right there
on time to the second,

57:27.402 --> 57:29.609
you're gonna have to walk home.

57:29.613 --> 57:32.526
We'll be there, skipper.

57:32.532 --> 57:33.909
Do the deed!

57:56.890 --> 57:58.676
Two hours in.

57:58.683 --> 58:02.051
Forty-five minutes
at the beach landing site.

58:02.062 --> 58:05.475
If I'm a no-show, you're taking them in.

58:05.482 --> 58:08.315
With pleasure. Just a walk in the park.

58:08.485 --> 58:09.816
No, it isn't.

58:09.820 --> 58:12.403
Just because we aren't
expecting resistance,

58:12.405 --> 58:14.271
don't relax on this one.

58:21.373 --> 58:22.829
How you doing?

58:22.833 --> 58:26.451
I hate jumping out of a
perfectly good airplane.

58:26.461 --> 58:28.577
You don't gotta love it,
you just gotta do it.

58:56.908 --> 58:58.410
What's our altitude?

58:58.410 --> 59:03.120
- What's our altitude?
- It's about 30,000. That's six miles up.

59:03.123 --> 59:04.830
You guys are crazy.

59:04.833 --> 59:08.121
That's right, and proud of it, baby.

59:10.338 --> 59:13.376
Zebra 23, six minutes
to launch point.

59:13.383 --> 59:15.169
Copy, Black Fire.

59:15.177 --> 59:17.009
Roger. Six minutes.

59:17.012 --> 59:18.377
Six minutes!

59:20.348 --> 59:24.433
Six minutes.

59:34.070 --> 59:38.234
Hey, man, what's with the goggles?
You look like you're underwater already.

59:38.241 --> 59:39.697
Eat shit!

59:52.130 --> 59:53.791
Okay, gentlemen,
grab your masks.

59:53.798 --> 59:55.709
We're beginning to depressurize.

59:55.717 --> 59:57.674
We are going to depressurize here.

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:09.519
Let's go.

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:43.971
Jesus, Dane!
Who the fuck packed your chute?

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:48.434
It doesn't look good.
I wouldn't jump it if I were you.

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:50.768
All right, gentlemen.
Stand by.

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:54.060
On the green!
On the green!

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:57.935
One more thing.
For God's sakes, be careful out there!

01:00:57.946 --> 01:01:00.529
If I was careful,
I'd be in the Coast Guard.

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:03.820
Five, four, three, two, one.

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:05.113
Go! Go! Go!

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:00.710
Oh, shit!

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:04.634
Shit! Graham's got a streamer!

01:02:04.637 --> 01:02:06.423
Graham, release!

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:07.842
Release, Graham!

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:09.840
Bail! Bail! Bail!

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:11.433
Get away, Graham!

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.314
Pull out!

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:16.351
Pull out, Graham! Pull!

01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:17.564
Pull!

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:50.149
Two booger-eaters dead ahead.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.241
Easy.

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:12.530
There she is.

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:21.080
- Try and stay awake.
- You bet.

01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:34.920
Team, this is Leader.
We're in.

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:37.047
Leader, this is God.
I'm in position.

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:39.390
This is Five.
Security set.

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:43.471
Two, this is Leader.
What's your status?

01:05:44.857 --> 01:05:47.565
Leader, this is Two.
I'm in position.

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:02.072
Leader, this is Four.

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:06.918
I got a midnight stroller headed my way.

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:08.878
Is he gonna be a problem?

01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:14.176
Four, this is Leader.
Is he gonna be a problem?

01:06:14.178 --> 01:06:17.136
Leader, this is Three.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.006
Ramos ain't being rude.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:23.602
Our stroller just camped
out in his backyard.

01:06:23.605 --> 01:06:24.891
What's his status?

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:29.433
If he was any closer,
he'd be inside him.

01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:35.485
All right. Let's try to keep it quiet.
We don't need a confrontation right now.

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:36.822
You got it.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:17.568
Leader, party just got bigger.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:21.736
And they brought their fireworks.

01:07:21.746 --> 01:07:24.829
I'm not there, Chief.
You make the call.

01:07:24.832 --> 01:07:27.369
Three, this is Two.
Sounds like you need some help.

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:28.993
Negative, Two.

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:33.413
- I got them dead to rights. Stay put.
- I'm coming down.

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:36.132
- Hawkins, don't start anything.
- I'm on my way.

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:37.341
Hawkins.

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:50.772
Ramos, we're clear?

01:07:50.775 --> 01:07:51.936
Clear.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:56.020
All right, Chief.
Let's go tag them and bag them.

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:01.073
Hey, Chief.

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:28.514
He's dead.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:34.232
I told you to stay put.

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.406
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:55.525
Oh, God!

01:09:57.485 --> 01:10:00.477
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:05.357
Detail, ready. Aim. Fire!

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:14.784
Aim. Fire!

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:16.496
Present!

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:29.779
On behalf of a grateful
nation and a proud Navy,

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:31.287
I present this flag to you

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:35.326
in recognition of your son's years
of honorable and faithful service

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:37.950
and his sacrifice for this nation.

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.002
Yes. Thank you.

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:44.664
Right!

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:47.083
Order!

01:11:58.105 --> 01:12:00.392
I've got a right to know, James.

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.396
How did he die?

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.277
It was a training accident.

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:12.609
Bullshit.

01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:16.578
You're lying.

01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:18.994
I can't talk about it, Jo.

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:23.746
You can take all of that classified,
unsung hero stuff and shove it!

01:12:29.762 --> 01:12:31.719
Tell me something, James.

01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:38.559
It may seem simple to you,

01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:42.597
but if we had been married,

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.897
would I have gotten a flag?

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:51.401
Yeah.

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:54.901
You would have gotten a flag.

01:12:57.999 --> 01:13:02.869
Oh, God.

01:13:51.343 --> 01:13:54.711
- God damn it, man! I can't watch this shit.
- Another round here!

01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:57.054
Let's get another round here!

01:13:57.058 --> 01:14:00.221
Another round here!
Another round!

01:14:00.227 --> 01:14:02.719
- Put it on my tab.
- You got it. Mr. Graham, right?

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:05.722
Billy Graham.
All the drinks are on me tonight.

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:08.100
- Big spender!
- That's right.

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:10.727
- What are you celebrating?
- Retirement.

01:14:10.738 --> 01:14:12.729
Hey! Where's mine?

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:16.403
Retirement!

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:18.401
Hey, ain't it time for the game?

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:19.994
Hell, yeah. Turn it on!

01:14:19.997 --> 01:14:21.499
- Turn it on.
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:24.867
We're watching the Cuervo Gold
Golf Classic, okay? Thanks.

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:29.288
Is this your bar, squidly?
'Cause if it ain't, butt out.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:32.632
You want me to butt out?
Okay, right, yeah.

01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:35.377
This guy wants a beer
bottle shoved up his ass.

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:38.054
Butt out.

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:43.510
- Now who you telling to butt out?
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:46.263
Excuse me. Excuse me.
We just lost a good buddy.

01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:48.526
Same guy that happens
to be on that television.

01:14:48.526 --> 01:14:50.688
So, we're having a couple
drinks to say goodbye to him.

01:14:50.694 --> 01:14:52.901
Now, why don't you say goodbye?

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:10.586
Fucking asshole.

01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:12.914
I love you.

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:22.428
A toast.

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:25.268
Chief!

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:27.512
The best friend a guy ever had.

01:15:52.173 --> 01:15:53.208
<i>H93' '</i>

01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:55.919
What's your problem?

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:57.963
My toast not good enough for you?

01:16:00.264 --> 01:16:03.177
You still don't get it, do you?

01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:06.643
Don't you take any responsibility
for what happened?

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:12.106
How come you left the doorway?

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:14.771
Huh?

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:17.816
You looking for a fight?

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:23.784
You looking for a rush? A little rush?

01:16:23.787 --> 01:16:26.700
Well, I hope you got it.

01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:29.495
'Cause you're toasting a
man you put in the grave.

01:16:31.378 --> 01:16:32.994
All right!

01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:35.713
All right, I did!
I fucked up!

01:16:35.716 --> 01:16:37.878
I fucked up and he's gone!

01:16:37.885 --> 01:16:40.923
And there isn't a damn
thing I can do about it!

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:43.137
So what do you want from me? Huh?

01:17:20.719 --> 01:17:23.962
Excuse me. Excuse me.
The party's over here.

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:25.839
Please.

01:17:25.849 --> 01:17:27.635
No? I tried.

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:36.391
Hello?

01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:18.027
You Okay?

01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:38.878
So when he tells you
where the missiles are,

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:41.088
does that mean you have to go back?

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:45.630
Yeah.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.847
- You should...
- What?

01:18:54.104 --> 01:18:55.640
Nothing. It's...

01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:46.904
They found them.

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:23.307
So Mohammed spilled the beans, huh?

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:26.443
Hey. I'm still a part
of this fucking outfit.

01:20:31.743 --> 01:20:33.450
All right.

01:20:33.454 --> 01:20:35.821
Grab your gear.
We're going to Beirut.

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:42.577
The missiles are located in a
schoolhouse in the Shiite slums of Beirut.

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:46.456
A contact from the Amal militia will
meet you on the beach and take you in.

01:20:46.758 --> 01:20:49.796
Heavy fighting has just broken out,
so don't get involved.

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:53.967
Just get to the missiles and blow them.
Be back in the water by dawn.

01:20:53.974 --> 01:20:55.590
See you on the sub.

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:57.467
Make sure you're there.

01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:43.865
Let's stash these boats.

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:59.722
Where the hell's this guy
we're supposed to meet? He's late.

01:23:06.481 --> 01:23:08.688
You're late.

01:23:08.692 --> 01:23:10.148
You from Amal?

01:23:14.114 --> 01:23:16.025
Ali.

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:17.990
Christ, he's just a kid.

01:23:22.914 --> 01:23:25.042
I guess the kid's on point.

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:01.776
Incoming!

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:07.998
Go! Go! Go!

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:09.457
Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!

01:24:27.479 --> 01:24:30.016
Dark side of the moon, guys.

01:24:30.023 --> 01:24:32.014
Green line.

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:35.609
Druze, Amal, Hezbollah, Al-Shuhada.

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:38.612
Israel.

01:24:41.827 --> 01:24:43.363
The asshole of misery.

01:25:31.168 --> 01:25:33.785
This ain't our beef, guys.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.297
Let's move out.

01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:09.741
Now knock it off! We need you!

01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:13.365
- Watch the kid!
- Like he was my own.

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:23.250
I'm going to high ground!

01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:25.127
Find it!

01:26:25.138 --> 01:26:26.754
- Cover me!
- Go!

01:26:31.394 --> 01:26:32.555
Fuck!

01:26:52.582 --> 01:26:54.323
Hawkins!

01:26:54.334 --> 01:26:55.495
Go!

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:05.755
Fucking kid led us
into a shitstorm!

01:27:05.762 --> 01:27:07.469
What was your first clue?

01:27:08.932 --> 01:27:10.422
Bad Karma, this is God.

01:27:11.309 --> 01:27:14.017
I'm about 100 meters to
the west of your position.

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:16.227
Have multiple targets sighted.

01:27:21.778 --> 01:27:24.110
God, this is Bad Karma.
Come in.

01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:27.110
God, this is Bad Karma.
Come in!

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:30.447
It's not right.
I'm gonna go check it out.

01:27:30.453 --> 01:27:31.989
Keep me posted.

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:05.857
You guys, I've got company up here.

01:28:05.864 --> 01:28:08.447
You're an American?

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:10.942
God. Come in, God.

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:12.989
Your God doesn't help you now.

01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:27.716
Dane?

01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:40.139
Dane.

01:28:42.067 --> 01:28:43.557
Hi, Lieutenant.

01:28:46.029 --> 01:28:49.397
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah.

01:28:49.407 --> 01:28:50.909
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:37.278
This is Two. Dane's dead.
We're coming down.

01:29:58.143 --> 01:30:00.635
- Get us out of here, kid.
- Come.

01:30:31.176 --> 01:30:32.666
There.

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:34.179
- Where?
- There.

01:30:37.057 --> 01:30:38.138
I go.

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:34.607
Looks like we got a slumber
party on the third floor.

01:31:39.536 --> 01:31:41.072
Looks like about it.

01:31:42.455 --> 01:31:44.321
All right.

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:46.699
I'm going in.

01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:48.916
I want in on this, Lieutenant.

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.957
Okay, let's do it.

01:31:50.964 --> 01:31:52.420
You might need this.

01:32:11.734 --> 01:32:13.270
Come on, guys.

01:32:41.431 --> 01:32:42.887
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:43.881
Clear.

01:32:47.729 --> 01:32:49.686
- Bingo.
- Verify it.

01:33:11.544 --> 01:33:13.501
Let's pray for rain.

01:33:16.507 --> 01:33:18.248
Jesus Christ!

01:33:19.802 --> 01:33:21.133
Go to work.

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.856
Piece of cake.

01:33:42.617 --> 01:33:46.531
Christ, the sun will be
up in 10 or 15 minutes.

01:33:46.537 --> 01:33:49.996
When that light hits the water,
this boat will be compromised.

01:33:49.999 --> 01:33:54.744
I'm sorry. In 20 minutes, we're
out of here, SEALs or no SEALs.

01:33:54.754 --> 01:33:56.995
Relax. They'll be here.

01:34:07.183 --> 01:34:11.347
Leader, this is Two.
It's getting real bright out here.

01:34:11.354 --> 01:34:15.723
- What the fuck are they doing in there?
- Maybe they're having breakfast.

01:34:21.114 --> 01:34:24.232
Be advised.
We have movement on the second floor.

01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:38.913
Boring conversation.
Leader, we're gonna have company.

01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:40.789
Rexer! Leary! We gotta go!

01:34:42.427 --> 01:34:43.588
Do it.

01:35:03.573 --> 01:35:05.029
Curran's hit.

01:35:11.748 --> 01:35:13.330
Hello again, scumbag!

01:35:32.518 --> 01:35:35.101
Hawkins! Blow it!

01:35:35.104 --> 01:35:37.095
Sorry, boss. I can't do that.

01:35:37.106 --> 01:35:39.848
- Sounds like an order to me, Lieutenant.
- Fuck his order!

01:35:40.026 --> 01:35:41.562
Blow it. Blow it.

01:35:41.736 --> 01:35:44.899
Leary, maintain your field of fire.
Keep their fucking heads down.

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:47.565
Hawkins, yeah, okay. I'm going hot.

01:35:49.327 --> 01:35:51.443
Rexer, try and get an
angle on that balcony.

01:35:51.454 --> 01:35:53.661
If he shows you a piece, blow it off.

01:35:54.707 --> 01:35:57.699
Ramos, when I break cover,
you rock the front of that building.

01:35:57.710 --> 01:36:00.793
Here. You might need this.

01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:30.904
This is Two. I'm pinned down.

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:33.572
Ramos, jump on the 50.
Put that fucker on his knees.

01:36:33.579 --> 01:36:36.412
Hang tight. Hang tight.

01:36:36.416 --> 01:36:37.952
Power is on its way.

01:36:43.506 --> 01:36:45.247
Take that, Shaheed.

01:36:50.096 --> 01:36:52.758
SEAL team.
I've come to get you out.

01:36:52.765 --> 01:36:54.551
- Christ!
- Come on.

01:36:56.769 --> 01:36:58.885
This is Two. We're moving.

01:37:07.155 --> 01:37:08.816
Blow it, Ramos!

01:37:25.631 --> 01:37:28.293
- You all right?
- Never better!

01:37:28.301 --> 01:37:30.292
Need some help over here!

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:39.429
GO, 90, go! go!

01:37:49.864 --> 01:37:52.481
- I'm out of ammo here.
- You got any mags?

01:37:55.328 --> 01:37:57.114
Morphine syrette.
Give me a morphine syrette.

01:37:57.121 --> 01:37:58.498
I got it. I got it.

01:37:58.498 --> 01:38:02.332
- Looks like I got an abdominal and a thigh.
- Dress it. Quickly.

01:38:02.335 --> 01:38:03.450
Quickly.

01:38:04.253 --> 01:38:07.211
Okay, let it go. Let go for a second.
Let go for a second.

01:38:07.215 --> 01:38:09.081
You're really gonna love this.

01:38:09.091 --> 01:38:11.469
WOW!

01:38:11.469 --> 01:38:14.461
- Help him, Rexer. Ramos, you got rear!
- I got one mag left.

01:38:14.472 --> 01:38:17.055
Use it! Come on, pull it!
Let's hit the beach!

01:38:48.548 --> 01:38:51.210
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Move your fucking ass!

01:38:51.217 --> 01:38:53.709
Out! Get out!

01:38:53.719 --> 01:38:56.177
Get out! Move it!

01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:58.091
Get out of here! Get out of here!

01:39:08.734 --> 01:39:09.986
I got him.

01:39:18.035 --> 01:39:19.537
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:39:21.914 --> 01:39:24.702
Put your heads down.
Put your fucking heads down!

01:39:26.127 --> 01:39:28.585
- Back down here. Back down!
- All right, all right, all right.

01:39:28.588 --> 01:39:30.454
It's a one-way street!

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:34.135
Oh, shit!

01:39:48.274 --> 01:39:50.606
We know the ocean is west
and we're traveling east,

01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:52.772
so where the fuck are we?

01:39:52.778 --> 01:39:54.030
Lost

01:39:55.364 --> 01:39:58.197
It looks the same. It all looks the same.

01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.611
Stay left.

01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:08.284
The sub leaves in five minutes.
This doesn't look good.

01:40:08.294 --> 01:40:10.251
- It just got worse.
- Duck!

01:40:34.695 --> 01:40:36.436
I think we lost them.

01:40:39.367 --> 01:40:42.280
- Behind us!
- Oh, shit! He's right on my ass!

01:40:44.163 --> 01:40:48.703
- We gotta get out of here!
- No, don't move! He can't get a clear shot!

01:40:49.752 --> 01:40:52.119
Hard right! Hard right! Hard right!

01:41:02.473 --> 01:41:05.261
Leary, you got that missile.
You might wanna think about using it.

01:41:05.267 --> 01:41:07.349
I would if I could figure
the damn thing out.

01:41:07.353 --> 01:41:09.310
It's a one-shot deal.

01:41:09.313 --> 01:41:11.771
- What?
- You miss, we die.

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:26.244
- We lost them! I think we lost them!
- Thank God!

01:41:26.247 --> 01:41:28.864
I can smell the ocean.
We're close. Real close.

01:41:29.041 --> 01:41:30.202
Yeah, real close.

01:41:32.378 --> 01:41:33.994
- Fuck!
- Get down!

01:41:50.896 --> 01:41:52.512
Waste that fucker!

01:41:54.734 --> 01:41:55.895
Eat this!

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:01.312
Outstanding.

01:42:02.491 --> 01:42:04.949
- Come on! Come on!
- Rexer!

01:42:04.952 --> 01:42:06.659
Rexer.

01:42:06.662 --> 01:42:08.619
The car's on fire, guys.

01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:10.363
Come on, we got time.
We gotta get out of here!

01:42:10.374 --> 01:42:12.206
- What about Rexer?
- Rexer's dead.

01:42:12.209 --> 01:42:13.745
We got to leave him! He's dead.

01:42:13.753 --> 01:42:16.165
Come on, Hawk! Get him up!
Get him up!

01:42:25.556 --> 01:42:29.925
Come right 270 degrees. Depth, 300.

01:42:29.935 --> 01:42:32.723
All ahead standard.

01:42:32.730 --> 01:42:34.346
Ten more minutes.
That's all I ask.

01:42:34.356 --> 01:42:39.226
Look, I've got 107 men aboard this
half-billion-dollar piece of equipment.

01:42:39.236 --> 01:42:41.694
No way I'm gonna hazard this boat.

01:42:41.697 --> 01:42:44.655
All ahead standard. Depth, 300.

01:43:34.917 --> 01:43:36.157
Come on.

01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:57.982
Come on! Get up! Get up!

01:43:57.982 --> 01:44:00.974
They won't fuck with us in the water!
Come on!

01:44:19.795 --> 01:44:21.001
Get down!

01:44:30.472 --> 01:44:31.678
Down!

01:46:58.579 --> 01:46:59.694
Clear!

01:47:10.132 --> 01:47:12.590
- Any sign of the sub?
- What do you think?

01:47:13.886 --> 01:47:15.297
It's typical.

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:21.557
Maybe they heard something.

01:47:22.895 --> 01:47:24.681
Maybe.

01:47:24.688 --> 01:47:26.929
Maybe they heard the explosion.

01:47:39.745 --> 01:47:41.861
How long you guys wanna wait?
