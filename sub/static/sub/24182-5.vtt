00:12.011 --> 00:15.098
[Alexa] It was weird, but now that people
thought Katie had cancer,

00:15.181 --> 00:16.474
nobody thought I did.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.435
It's not like I wanted
to take advantage of it,

00:18.518 --> 00:21.438
but what's the point in them
thinking we both have cancer, right?

00:22.272 --> 00:24.816
Here, Katie. I got you a candle.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.568
It smells like birthday cake.

00:26.651 --> 00:28.111
[sniffs]

00:28.194 --> 00:29.279
[exhales]

00:29.362 --> 00:30.947
Oh. Uh... Um...

00:31.031 --> 00:32.157
[chuckles] Thanks.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.910
[sighs] Thanks for not ratting me out.
I couldn't handle those pitying looks.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.662
I-It's not that bad.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.290
Really? Not even the concerned head tilt?

00:40.790 --> 00:42.083
"How are you, Katie?"

00:42.917 --> 00:44.419
How are you, Katie?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.838
Hannah, you know I don't have cancer.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.298
I know.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.633
But I don't want people
to think I don't care.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.969
[exclaims loudly] You're my hero!

00:55.472 --> 00:57.974
Doesn't it drive you nuts
that people treat you differently?

00:58.725 --> 01:00.393
Not that differently.

01:01.686 --> 01:03.104
OK, who cares?

01:03.188 --> 01:06.357
In the meantime, I'm getting
my holiday shopping done early.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.401
Merry Christmas, Grandma.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.030
[fanfare recording playing]

01:15.408 --> 01:16.826
Attention, students.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.704
For those of you who don't know me,
I'm Ms. Rogers.

01:19.788 --> 01:24.626
And I'm excited to announce
auditions are tomorrow for the fall play.

01:24.709 --> 01:28.546
Have you noticed? Love is in the air.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.672
For me, anyway.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.759
His name is Scott.
Not that it's anyone's business.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.678
And it's inspired me to choose

01:35.762 --> 01:38.723
Romeo and Juliet.

01:38.807 --> 01:39.808
That's right.

01:39.891 --> 01:43.520
We are going to William shake it up a bit.

01:44.103 --> 01:48.358
[in British accent] Until then,
good morrow, my lords and ladies.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.276
-[Katie gasps]
-Aw!

01:50.360 --> 01:52.237
Do you remember
the last play that we were in?

01:52.320 --> 01:54.364
Oh, yeah. Beauty and the Beast.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.242
You were Belle and I was a dancing fork.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.827
[laughs] You were an awesome fork.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.204
I've always wanted to play Juliet.

02:01.287 --> 02:04.415
Well, it's a natural progression
from fork to Juliet.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.793
You should totally sign up.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.503
Yeah, I-I'm going to.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.840
And this time I won't have to dance around
with a meatball on my head.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.843
I don't know. It's Ms. Rogers.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.971
Last year she made everyone
in The Sound of Music a vampire.

02:18.054 --> 02:22.308
Oh, yeah. The hills were alive,
but everyone else was dead, so...

from breakfast?

Oh, I did.

[Jack] Sorry, Mom!

03:05.018 --> 03:07.020
Just make sure
it doesn't happen again, buster.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.398
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, sweetie. How was school?

03:10.481 --> 03:13.484
Great! I signed up
to audition for the fall play.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.236
That's fantastic!

03:15.320 --> 03:18.698
Did I ever tell you that I was once
in a production of My Fair Lady?

03:19.198 --> 03:21.784
[in Cockney accent]
Had a bit of a Cockney accent, I did.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.579
Yeah. Yeah, I'm not doing that.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.665
I am going over to Alexa's
to work on my audition.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.585
-Sorry guv'nor, you're supposed to watch--
-Mom, Mom.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.505
You're supposed to watch Jack.
I have to go to school.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.633
But, no, I can't concentrate
with him around.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.051
He's quiet as a mouse.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.886
[loud clattering upstairs]

[clattering stops]

03:43.806 --> 03:45.808
[clattering resumes]

03:46.809 --> 03:48.853
Well, that was unfortunate timing.
[chuckles]

03:49.938 --> 03:52.315
All right, you just focus
on doing what you need to do

03:52.398 --> 03:55.068
and I will figure it out,
because that is what moms do.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.736
-Thank you!
-Mm-hmm.

03:57.612 --> 03:58.655
[mutters] Oh, God.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.198
I need a mom.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.704
[gasps] "But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

04:06.788 --> 04:09.415

04:09.499 --> 04:11.251
[giggles] It's so exciting!

04:11.334 --> 04:13.127
Well, yeah, I have to get cast first.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.672
Oh, I saw your fork.
You're getting this part!

04:16.714 --> 04:17.715
Hi, honey.

04:19.509 --> 04:23.471
That was close. When she gets like that,
she starts singing Katy Perry songs.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.056
I'm not afraid to roar.

04:27.558 --> 04:30.061
Let's get started.
[clears throat] I'll be Romeo.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.604
Oh, but I'm not ready to just--

04:31.688 --> 04:33.022
I'm already in character.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.818
"Shall I hear more
or shall I speak at this?"

04:36.901 --> 04:38.069
Wait! Wait!

04:38.486 --> 04:40.989
I-I always get nervous before auditions.

04:41.572 --> 04:42.573
And uh...

04:42.657 --> 04:43.908
This is going to sound silly,

04:43.992 --> 04:47.662
but remember when we used to do our plays
in front of your stuffed animals?

04:47.745 --> 04:48.913
Yeah.

04:49.163 --> 04:51.666
They were just always so supportive.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.670
Oh, except for that big bunny
with the judgmental eye.

04:55.753 --> 04:58.131
Mm. Bernard.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.093
What happened
to our little buddies, anyway?

05:02.176 --> 05:06.556
[scoffs] Well, you know,
obviously I outgrew them.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.183
[chuckles] You know,
at a certain point you say,

05:09.267 --> 05:12.145
"What am I doing with a bunch
of stuffed animals at my age?"

05:12.228 --> 05:14.480
[Alexa laughs]

05:14.564 --> 05:15.940

05:16.441 --> 05:18.443
They came home!

05:19.068 --> 05:20.695
[knocking at door]

05:23.364 --> 05:24.782
Hey, Lucas.

05:25.199 --> 05:27.035
So, I forgot what we agreed on.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.870
Uh... Eight dollars an hour, right?

05:28.953 --> 05:29.954
I think we said ten.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.290
Right. Right.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.459
Well, I feel lucky

05:34.542 --> 05:37.503
that such a fine young man
is available to be with Jack.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.839
I mean, you know,
he thinks the world of you.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.591
We all do.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.344
Thanks. It's still ten.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.181
[chuckles] All right.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.266
But I know how many corn dogs
are in the freezer.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.187
Lucas! I knew I heard your voice.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.105
Hey, bud.
Thought we would hang out tonight.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.733
Really? You got my text about hanging out?

05:59.192 --> 06:01.277
-You have a phone?
-Not a real one.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.446
That's why I'm surprised you got my text.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.282
Well, we're hanging out now.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.785
Like best friends?

06:08.868 --> 06:09.869
Sure.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.746
OK, OK! Let's play Pokémon.

06:11.829 --> 06:14.290
No, ride bikes. No, build a fort!

06:14.373 --> 06:16.501
I know, lightsaber fight.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.836
[sighs] I am Obi-Wan Kenobi.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.463
I can control your mind.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.637
How about we just chill?

06:30.473 --> 06:31.307
So...

06:31.808 --> 06:32.809
this is chilling?

06:33.434 --> 06:34.435
Yep.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.480
Chilling's kind of quiet.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.274
Could be quieter.

06:42.151 --> 06:46.572
"That which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet;

06:46.656 --> 06:50.159
so Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,

06:50.243 --> 06:54.413
retain that dear perfection
which he owes without that title."

06:55.915 --> 06:58.709
Whoa, Katie! That was really good.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.169
[chuckles] Was it?

07:00.253 --> 07:01.629
Well, don't take my word for it.

07:02.672 --> 07:03.673
Listen to them.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.635
Go, Katie! Yes!

07:09.846 --> 07:10.847
I could get this.

07:10.930 --> 07:15.017
Oh, my gosh! They're rushing the stage!

07:17.520 --> 07:19.230
Are we done chilling?

07:21.232 --> 07:22.275
Not yet, bud.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.444
A lot of people stop chilling
when it gets boring,

07:24.527 --> 07:29.031
so they never really hang in there
to achieve a true state of... chill.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.912
I can't believe
I'm going to say this, but...

07:35.955 --> 07:37.415
it's my bedtime.

07:38.916 --> 07:39.917
Uh-huh.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.085
[door opens]

07:41.711 --> 07:42.712
Hey.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.131
Oh. Lucas?

07:45.214 --> 07:46.591
Uh... [chuckles]

07:46.674 --> 07:48.009
W-What are you doing here?

07:48.092 --> 07:49.302
I'm watching Jack.

07:49.385 --> 07:50.511
Uh...

07:50.595 --> 07:52.221
Oh. So where is he?

07:53.890 --> 07:54.974
Hard to say.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.561
So... [chuckles]

07:58.644 --> 07:59.645
Wow.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.731
Here we are.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.818
Alexa says you're going out
for the school play.

08:05.902 --> 08:09.864
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah.
It's, uh... It's Romeo and Juliet.

08:09.947 --> 08:14.160
You know, the story of two teenagers
who are madly in love

08:14.243 --> 08:15.703
but can't be together.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.164
It's a tragedy.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.169
-You know what I just realized?
-Yes?

08:23.252 --> 08:24.378
You're here.

08:24.712 --> 08:25.546
I am.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.256
I can go home!

08:30.259 --> 08:32.762
[laughs] Yeah, let's do this again!

"What is Montague?

08:42.605 --> 08:44.607
It is not hand nor foot..."

See Juliet; be Juliet.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.453
Hey, you're gonna go out there
and do great.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.998
I hope so. Gosh, I really want this.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.424
[sighs] I nailed it.

09:11.425 --> 09:14.220
-That was good, Vanessa.
-I know, right?

Scott!

09:20.601 --> 09:24.021
The horn has sounded, the pursuit is on.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.856
Dare I open my heart?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.650
I don't know. I'm 14.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.361
Right.

09:30.861 --> 09:34.198
OK, next up we have Katie Cooper
reading for Juliet.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.117
Oh, Cancer Girl's reading for Juliet?

09:36.200 --> 09:38.578
Why did we even show up?
She's totally gonna get it.

-[Ms. Rogers] Katie Cooper?
-I-I'm Coopie Kater.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.960

"What is Montague?

09:48.087 --> 09:50.256
It is not hand, nor foot...

09:54.468 --> 09:55.553
Come on!

09:57.638 --> 09:58.472

OK.

totally be Romeo,

-What?

-What?
-What?

You are Juliet.

I will not let you down.

I don't know. Just keep walking.

[sighs] So, Katie went out
for Juliet today.

11:06.415 --> 11:07.291
Oh?

11:07.375 --> 11:08.584
And she did terrible!

11:08.668 --> 11:10.753
-Oh.
-But she still got the part!

11:10.836 --> 11:14.048
-Oh! Who's missing Mom and Dad now?
-Still me.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.928
I'm worried she got the part
because people think she has cancer.

11:19.011 --> 11:22.473
It's my biggest fear: that people
would give me things I didn't earn.

11:22.556 --> 11:24.558
And now that's happening to Katie.

11:24.642 --> 11:25.976
But what am I supposed to do?

11:26.060 --> 11:28.437
If I tell people,
the same thing's gonna happen to me.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.357
If I don't, I'll feel guilty
for letting it happen to Katie.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.235
Uh... Mom will be home soon.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.321
Yeah, you're right.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.783
Katie said she was fine, so I shouldn't
even be worrying about this.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.619
-It's gonna be OK.
-Thanks.

11:43.702 --> 11:46.038
Oh. Uh... I was talking to my hair.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.671
Hey, honey!

11:54.171 --> 11:55.798
How did the audition go?

11:55.881 --> 11:57.633
I didn't get a text from you.

11:57.716 --> 12:02.304
But from the look on your face,
I can tell that it was good...

12:02.388 --> 12:04.181
Bad...

12:04.265 --> 12:05.349
Good...

12:05.433 --> 12:07.268
Can you just tell me?
I had a really long day.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.104
-I'm Juliet.
-Really?

12:10.187 --> 12:11.981
Wait, why? Do you think I shouldn't have?

12:13.190 --> 12:15.693
Of course you should have gotten it!
I'm so proud of you!

12:16.694 --> 12:18.779
Thanks! Yeah, rehearsals start tomorrow.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.739
I need to find a babysitter again?

12:21.949 --> 12:23.576
I need to find a babysitter again!

12:26.245 --> 12:28.080
I just heard! Oh!

12:28.164 --> 12:29.665
Congratulations!

12:29.748 --> 12:33.252
[with increasing volume] Today Juliet,
tomorrow Broadway, then an Oscar.

12:33.335 --> 12:36.130
[laughs] Sorry, I just had an espresso.

12:37.298 --> 12:40.801
Now, this is going to be a lot of work,
but you're going to have such a good time.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.636
Oh! Oh, that reminds me.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.639
They need our parents to sign up
to help out with the production.

12:45.723 --> 12:49.477
"Set construction,
costumes, rehearsal snacks."

12:49.560 --> 12:50.561
Um...

12:50.644 --> 12:54.899
Where are the options for tired
but otherwise delightful single moms?

12:54.982 --> 12:59.069
Oh, I used to love doing all the costumes
for Alexa's productions.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.030
The King and I was a favorite.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.781
I still get compliments.

13:02.865 --> 13:03.866
[chuckles]

13:05.367 --> 13:07.578
-You did a great job.
-Oh, fantastic. Beautiful.

13:07.661 --> 13:08.662
Thank you.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.289
So, any chance--

13:10.372 --> 13:11.707
Oh, I'd love to!

13:12.208 --> 13:14.877
Oh, you know, I was actually saying
that I was feeling left out

13:14.960 --> 13:18.005
that Alexa wasn't in it this year,
so... count me in!

13:18.088 --> 13:19.507
-Thank you.
-Yeah!

13:19.590 --> 13:21.008
This will be fun, right?

13:21.091 --> 13:25.095
I mean, Juliet may be doomed, but nobody's
going to call her wardrobe a tragedy.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.181
[chuckles]

13:36.607 --> 13:38.442
Hey! Excuse me!

13:39.276 --> 13:40.277
I'm stuck!

13:41.654 --> 13:45.991
-Oh, good. Alexa, my skirt--
-I hope Katie's rehearsals go well.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.409
If you could just maybe--

13:47.493 --> 13:51.080
Because she needs to know that she
deserves this role because she's good.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.164
Do you have scissors?

13:52.248 --> 13:54.917
Otherwise,
how will she know she earned it?

13:55.000 --> 13:58.337
I don't want her to live like that,
always wondering.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.214
-Even a jagged house key?
-I've got to go.

14:02.841 --> 14:06.011
You deserve this. You deserve this.
You deserve this. You deserve this.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.429
Hey. H-How are you feeling?

14:07.513 --> 14:08.722
I deserve this!

14:09.890 --> 14:12.893
Oh. I just... wanted to introduce myself.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.604
-I'm Romeo. Ryan. Romeo.
-Oh.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.190
"What's in a name?" Am I right?

14:19.066 --> 14:21.527
Yeah, yeah. I-I'm sorry. I-I'm Katie.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.237
-Juliet.
-I know, yeah.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.196
[taunting whispers]

14:24.280 --> 14:27.616
So I hope that you're not nervous about
the kiss, because we do kiss later.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.326
But as Romeo and Juliet.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.371
I just wanted to let you know
that I'll be a gentleman.

14:32.454 --> 14:33.831
Uh... What? Oh!

14:33.914 --> 14:35.749
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.003
Um... I mean, I'll be a gentlewoman.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.882
-So we'll both be gentle.
-Mm.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.136
Well um... Anon, milady! [chuckles]

14:50.931 --> 14:53.851
All right. I need my Romeo and Juliet.

14:53.934 --> 14:57.104
Wherefore art my Romeo and Juliet?

14:57.980 --> 15:01.191
It's a moonlit night at the Capulet villa

15:01.275 --> 15:04.653
as our star-crossed lovers rendezvous.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.865
-And... act!
-[Ryan] Uh...

15:08.991 --> 15:12.661
"Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow...

15:13.078 --> 15:16.624
that tips with silver
all these fruit-tree tops."

15:17.249 --> 15:21.420
-"Oh, swear not by the moon--"
-Wait, wait. Something's missing.

15:21.503 --> 15:22.588
[boy] No joke.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.632
Vanessa should have been Juliet.

15:24.715 --> 15:25.966
She's terrible at this.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.635
Vampires?

15:29.720 --> 15:33.223
-[Ms. Rogers] Let's try it again, Katie.
-What? Oh! Oh, OK.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.851
I think she gets distracted
because of the cancer.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.645
[girl] The show's ruined because of her.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.896
[murmuring continues]

15:38.979 --> 15:41.649
"Oh, swear not by the moon,

15:41.732 --> 15:43.901
the, uh, inconstant moon...

15:44.610 --> 15:45.736
that monthly..."

15:46.236 --> 15:47.363
I'm gonna barf!

15:47.446 --> 15:49.073
"I'm gonna barf"? I don't have that.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.991
Oh! Use the garbage can!
Use the garbage can!

15:51.075 --> 15:53.327
-[Katie vomiting]
-Oh, that is so close.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.293
Oh, good! Katie, my skirt is--

16:01.377 --> 16:02.586
Oh, Hannah.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.673
I just had the worst rehearsal.

16:06.006 --> 16:09.176
-If you could just maybe--
-All the talk started getting to me.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.053
But, you know, I-I know I'm good.

16:11.136 --> 16:14.264
-Do you have scissors or--
-It doesn't matter what people think.

16:14.723 --> 16:17.184
Right? Yeah, right. OK, I've got to go.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.771
Even a jagged house key?

16:25.859 --> 16:27.194
How's it going, buddy?

16:27.736 --> 16:29.279
I ate a bunch of nickels.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.364
Cool.

16:35.285 --> 16:36.286
Hey!

16:38.247 --> 16:40.040
I thought this was going to be fun.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.382
Hey, Jack, your mom called.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.053
-What did she say?
-She told me to give you a dart dinner!

16:53.512 --> 16:54.513
[Jack gasps]

16:55.305 --> 16:57.558
You started war with the Skrull warrior.

16:57.641 --> 16:58.976
There will be no mercy.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.813
Yes! No mercy! Freedom for Earth!

17:02.896 --> 17:04.523
Skrulls forever!

17:04.606 --> 17:05.733
My force fields were up!

17:07.568 --> 17:09.528
Force fields only work
on the second floor!

17:09.611 --> 17:12.406
There's a secret basement!
We're on the second floor!

17:12.906 --> 17:14.283
-[Lucas yells]
-[Jack screams]

17:15.284 --> 17:17.745
-Hey!
-Hey! Did class get out early?

17:17.828 --> 17:21.623
Shh! I'm paying Lucas through the hour.
I have 15 more minutes of me time.

17:22.249 --> 17:25.419
Me time? Ooh!
I could really go for a glass of me time.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.256
Oh, thank you for covering me
for the wardrobe.

17:29.339 --> 17:30.424
I feel so guilty.

17:30.507 --> 17:34.470
Oh, honey, you're a single mom
who's struggling with work and school.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.305
-You're an inspiration--
-Is that mine?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.601
So, you want to sew a hem?

17:40.684 --> 17:43.103
-I do not.
-Mm, yeah.

17:43.812 --> 17:46.398
Yeah, me neither. Hmm. Let the kid trip.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.778
I totally got you! You're dead!

17:50.861 --> 17:52.863
Now I'm a cyborg! I can't die!

17:52.946 --> 17:54.281
You two are having fun.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.200
Yeah! Lucas is the best!

17:56.283 --> 17:58.285
I cannot thank you enough, Lucas.

17:58.368 --> 18:00.120
You are a lifesaver.

18:01.622 --> 18:02.623
Wait.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.000
You were babysitting me?

18:06.126 --> 18:07.753
I thought we were hanging out.

18:09.838 --> 18:10.881
We are.

18:11.715 --> 18:12.883
You don't have to pay me.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.595
I'm just hanging out with Jack
because... he's my friend.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.015
That is so swee--

18:23.602 --> 18:25.187

18:38.700 --> 18:40.702

-Yeah.

-Hey.

I know that you had a rough day yesterday,

18:52.172 --> 18:55.592
but just don't forget,
before all the whispering started,

18:55.676 --> 18:56.885
we saw how great you were.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.809
Oh, Bernard came!

19:04.309 --> 19:06.145
Oh, and he hates riding in cars.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.189
Hey, thanks.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.741
Uh... I don't want you to think the kiss
is the only thing on my mind. It...

19:22.327 --> 19:24.538
You know what? I will see you up kiss.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.748
Up there! There. I... [laughs]

Hey. Hey.
Uh... You know, I thought about it,

19:33.255 --> 19:36.633
and it doesn't really matter
if it's a good production.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.844
Making you Juliet
was the right thing to do.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.597

[Katie] Uh...

19:53.525 --> 19:54.818
Oh. What?

19:54.902 --> 19:56.361
No, I didn't even do anything.

19:57.571 --> 19:58.572
Please stop it.

why you don't want anyone to know.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.802
It is hard to believe in yourself
when nobody's being real.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.014
I-I thought I was good,
but I guess I was wrong.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.098
No.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.017
You were great.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.480

and they need to know, too.

-No.

I know some of you think
that girl's Katie.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.546
And I know some of you think
she got the part because she has cancer.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.299
You have cancer?

20:59.383 --> 21:01.218
I had no idea.

21:01.301 --> 21:03.720
I've been kind of focused on Scott.

-He's my boyfriend--
-Katie doesn't have cancer!
