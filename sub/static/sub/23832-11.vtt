WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:12.137 --> 00:13.763
Why should we obey this girl?

00:13.847 --> 00:16.766
Why are branch families gathered for this?
Did something happen?

00:16.975 --> 00:22.147
- What was the previous head thinking?
- You people really are worthless.

00:22.981 --> 00:26.151
To think you're part of our family...
it almost brings me to tears.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.903
Your banal greed, your banal desires...

00:28.987 --> 00:31.614
your banal spite, I'm sick of it all.

00:32.907 --> 00:35.410
As head of this family, I reject you all.

00:35.493 --> 00:38.121
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- Such a brat!

00:38.204 --> 00:40.915
If you have a problem with that,
bring it on.

00:40.999 --> 00:45.503
I welcome you into this ideal castle
that I've created myself!

00:47.672 --> 00:50.467
I will wager... 100 chips!

00:52.427 --> 00:55.305
Idiot! You're making an unwise choice.

00:56.347 --> 00:59.434
You'll get me back on the council?
That's so absurd.

01:00.101 --> 01:03.438
There's no way that the president
would ever allow that!

01:04.064 --> 01:08.818
Not to mention, nothing annoys me more
than the way you look down on me!

01:08.902 --> 01:10.528
You told me once,  senpai...

01:11.154 --> 01:13.239
that you and I were the same.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.742
That's why...

01:15.825 --> 01:19.954
Because we're the same,
I'm going to take you down!

02:57.385 --> 03:00.179
Now, then, let's resume gambling.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.271
Change any cards?

03:08.938 --> 03:12.317
- I'll take two.
- Two cards for me, too, please.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.280
- A pair of queens?
- Who in their right mind...?

03:17.363 --> 03:18.698
Yumeko's up to something!

03:19.532 --> 03:22.493
This woman...
Who would've thought she'd try it twice?

03:23.077 --> 03:26.164
This time, for sure,
she's going for a garbage hand.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.666
She's trying to win
with the weaker hand. But...

03:28.750 --> 03:30.877
Let's move on to the betting round.

03:32.629 --> 03:39.344
With all these chips, I don't need
to be stingy, do I? I bet 20 chips.

03:39.427 --> 03:40.678
Yumeko!

03:41.346 --> 03:46.184
Did she say 20? If I don't raise her,
I can gamble for the win with one chip.

03:46.768 --> 03:50.188
Should I give Yumeko Jabami
the right to choose and try my luck?

03:51.105 --> 03:55.568
No, I won't risk losing the chance
to rake in 200 million with this hand!

03:56.903 --> 03:59.781
All I need to do is take the high road!

03:59.864 --> 04:03.743
- I raise you 20 chips!
- Excellent!

04:04.327 --> 04:08.831
- I raise you 20 chips.
- I raise you ten.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.709
Seventy-one chips in all, then?

04:12.627 --> 04:16.381
That's an uneven number.
Let's take this as far as we can!

04:16.965 --> 04:18.800
I raise you 29 chips!

04:18.883 --> 04:21.177
What the hell? She's going all in?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.263
Is she that confident she'll win?

04:24.973 --> 04:30.770
You never cease to amaze me.
You have some nerve. You can't be normal.

04:31.521 --> 04:35.191
You might be someone I could use
in my student council.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.735
Oh, please... I'm so honored!

04:38.486 --> 04:41.447
That's precisely why
I have to win right now.

04:42.407 --> 04:46.703
I thought that I needed to reform
the student council...

04:46.786 --> 04:48.121
but I was wrong!

04:48.913 --> 04:50.832
I'm raising you 30 chips!

04:50.915 --> 04:53.334
Come work for me, Yumeko Jabami!

04:54.752 --> 04:58.381
Manyuda, why would you keep
matching Yumeko raise for raise?

04:59.007 --> 05:00.883
Manyuda can win on financial might.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.761
He doesn't need to play
such a high-stakes game.

05:04.345 --> 05:07.307
In that case, I can think of one reason.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.978
He's sure he can win
as long as he gets the right to choose.

05:12.562 --> 05:16.107
Yumeko's out of chips now.
At this rate, she's gonna lose.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.609
Vice President?

05:20.111 --> 05:23.698
Please add more chips.
We're going to raise by ten.

05:23.781 --> 05:24.741
What?

05:25.992 --> 05:29.704
I can't afford to hold back.
I'm stretching myself to the limit.

05:30.371 --> 05:33.291
Didn't I tell you?
I'm going to take you down!

05:35.835 --> 05:37.170
I raise you ten.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.589
Splendid!

05:40.715 --> 05:42.967
- I raise you ten!
- Ditto.

05:43.926 --> 05:49.807
How splendid this is. This was supposed
to be a showdown of hands, but now...

05:51.017 --> 05:52.977
- I raise you ten!
- Ditto.

05:53.561 --> 05:57.315
Now, we're piling on the money!

05:58.149 --> 06:01.611
What the...? This isn't even
a gambling match anymore.

06:01.694 --> 06:06.824
I don't like the way this is going.
Manyuda's the student council accountant.

06:06.908 --> 06:11.829
His access to funds is unmatched. If this
is about who can throw in more money...

06:12.413 --> 06:13.873
I raise ten chips!

06:13.956 --> 06:16.542
I'm close to my limit now. I can't--

06:16.626 --> 06:19.128
Sumeragi, you really are pathetic.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.382
You refuse to recognize the gap
between your ideals and your abilities.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.759
You're making bad judgment calls.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.888
Just as I said, you're not qualified
to take the high road.

06:28.971 --> 06:32.100
You're an incompetent who just happens
to have more money than others.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.853
I don't want to hear your drivel!
Bet or call it quits!

06:35.937 --> 06:37.480
I raise you 100 chips.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.696
The pot is getting rather large.

06:46.280 --> 06:49.117
This gamble
is all about raising the stakes.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.036
Betting non-existent money
would put a damper on it all.

06:53.079 --> 06:57.083
You need to remember just how much
I've added to the academy's pool.

06:57.166 --> 07:00.461
- I've got more than enough.
- True.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.547
All right, next.

07:02.630 --> 07:05.758
Yumeko Jabami,
are you going to make another bet?

07:10.138 --> 07:12.890
Sumeragi, are you out of funds?

07:14.267 --> 07:15.435
I'm sorry.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.105
I'm really maxed out now.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.232
Is that right?

07:22.692 --> 07:26.154
But no worries.
You still have something to bet with.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.699
Before, when I fell into debt,

07:29.782 --> 07:33.744
the student council issued me
something called a "life plan."

07:34.495 --> 07:39.709
That means that a value of 310 million yen
has been placed on my life, right?

07:40.168 --> 07:45.173
I'm talking about your life!
Let's bet everything we have, Sumeragi!

07:46.591 --> 07:50.386
Sumeragi, you're the daughter of the CEO
of a major Japanese toy maker.

07:50.470 --> 07:55.433
I can't begin to imagine
just how much that would make you worth!

07:55.516 --> 07:58.853
If we go for that and you lose, then I...

07:58.936 --> 08:02.899
Yes! You'll be a house pet until you die!

08:05.193 --> 08:09.906
I was wrong. I never should've
gotten involved with her.

08:09.989 --> 08:13.451
In Yumeko Jabami's eyes, gambling
means putting everything on the line.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.496
For Yumeko, that's the ultimate ecstasy.

08:16.579 --> 08:20.625
Of course, she'd urge
her own friends to do the same.

08:21.125 --> 08:26.088
It's totally out of benevolence! What's
the matter? All you have to do is nod yes!

08:27.173 --> 08:28.674
I'm getting sucked in...

08:28.758 --> 08:31.844
into the bottomless abyss
of an endless gamble!

08:33.888 --> 08:35.056
Hurry up!

08:44.690 --> 08:48.611
Oh, well, if your choice is not to bet,
it can't be helped.

08:49.278 --> 08:54.075
But I do have one warning. If you
don't believe you can bet on this hand...

08:55.368 --> 08:57.453
If your resolve only goes so far...

08:58.496 --> 09:02.458
then you'll be better off
not trying to reach the top.

09:05.378 --> 09:09.465
She's absolutely right.
My ambition wasn't nearly strong enough.

09:09.549 --> 09:14.178
Was it the right choice, giving up
just because I'd lose it all if I failed?

09:15.429 --> 09:19.809
No, it wasn't! I shouldn't have harbored
that kind of ambition from the start!

09:19.892 --> 09:26.440
I'm not gonna run. I'm not gonna cry.
Visualize it. We can win with this hand!

09:27.066 --> 09:30.861
I'm going to follow in those footsteps.
I'm gonna be king!

09:30.945 --> 09:32.572
In order to achieve that...

09:33.906 --> 09:38.035
In order to win... I'll do anything!

09:46.210 --> 09:48.379
Vice President! I'll raise him my life!

09:48.462 --> 09:50.590
THE GIRL WHO WOULD STAKE HER LIFE

09:52.967 --> 09:56.554
Lovely! That's what
I love to hear, Sumeragi!

09:56.637 --> 09:58.889
This is what you call gambling.

09:59.348 --> 10:02.143
Oh, my... if you flaunt such resolve...

10:03.019 --> 10:05.104
I think I'm going to start seething!

10:05.980 --> 10:11.569
I don't know what you're imagining, but
I bet my life in order to win. That's all.

10:11.652 --> 10:14.155
I have no intention of being ruined.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.782
Sorry to say this
after you tore off your nails...

10:17.658 --> 10:20.244
but I'm sure such a raise
would never be permitted.

10:21.829 --> 10:26.375
- Oh?
- Choice Poker is all about the money.

10:26.459 --> 10:30.421
Betting something incalculable,
such as life, wouldn't work.

10:31.255 --> 10:35.384
- Therefore, I reject your raise!
- You're telling me now?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.094
I think you're
misunderstanding something.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.513
Jabami's Life Plan

10:39.597 --> 10:43.142
was only issued as collateral
against repayment of her debt.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.561
It's not an estimate of her worth.

10:46.228 --> 10:50.775
The one with the final say on life plans
is the student council president.

10:50.858 --> 10:54.779
It would be doubly impossible
for this raise to be permitted here.

10:56.364 --> 11:00.701
Well, of course, it's pointless
for players like us to quibble.

11:01.535 --> 11:06.957
The person in charge of this gamble
is the dealer. What is your ruling?

11:08.167 --> 11:12.380
As someone who loves both order
and the Darwinist rules of this academy,

11:12.463 --> 11:15.132
who frowns upon forced control...

11:15.216 --> 11:17.885
how exactly do you rule?

11:23.474 --> 11:25.017
I will permit this raise.

11:26.477 --> 11:29.271
Listen, you...
do you realize what you're saying?

11:29.355 --> 11:33.984
I am the dealer. I will be the one
to decide what can be wagered.

11:34.568 --> 11:37.822
Sumeragi's family's actual value
is several hundred billion yen.

11:37.905 --> 11:42.410
Her father is the CEO
as well as a majority shareholder.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.203
She stands to inherit all that.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.665
Surely, you don't object
my allowing a ten billion yen raise?

11:48.249 --> 11:52.128
Did you say ten billion?
A decision as insane as that...

11:52.211 --> 11:55.005
Neither you nor anyone else here
has that authority!

11:56.757 --> 11:59.135
Well, now... are you sure about that?

12:09.603 --> 12:11.397
What are you doing here?

12:11.981 --> 12:15.359
Why? There's no need for you
to know the reason.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.737
But if I had to say...

12:20.865 --> 12:23.742
To see the look on your face right now.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.911
That's ridiculous!

12:26.495 --> 12:29.874
I never saw that coming!

12:30.541 --> 12:35.337
The president left without telling me
where or why she was going.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.381
Not only that...

12:38.674 --> 12:42.636
How long has she been in our midst?

12:42.720 --> 12:43.846
Sayaka?

12:44.638 --> 12:47.349
Please come over here and do my hair.

12:57.276 --> 13:01.113
Now, then...
let's pick up where we left off.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.991
Itsuki's raise is ten billion yen,

13:04.074 --> 13:07.578
bringing Yumeko Jabami's wager
to a total of 12 billion yen.

13:08.162 --> 13:11.707
This isn't good! This woman always does
what she says she will!

13:12.291 --> 13:16.045
Twelve billion yen? There's no way
I can come up with that amount!

13:16.629 --> 13:22.259
If you're not going to call, we'll move on
to the choice phase. What?

13:22.343 --> 13:26.764
- You can't raise her anymore, right?
- That's the one thing I can't let happen!

13:27.431 --> 13:31.769
If Jabami seizes the right to choose,
I'll definitely lose!

13:31.852 --> 13:36.524
It won't be just any defeat! I'll lose
after forking over three billion yen.

13:36.607 --> 13:39.068
My status as a student council member...
down the drain!

13:39.652 --> 13:42.071
That's the one thing I've got to avoid!

13:43.822 --> 13:45.783
If that does come to pass...

13:46.367 --> 13:50.746
Kaede, from now on, you'll have to become
someone who takes the high road.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.374
The high road, did you say?

13:53.457 --> 13:58.295
Since you are my son,
it's your duty to run our nation.

13:59.004 --> 14:03.008
Money is the foundation of our country.
The one who controls it is king.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.303
You're going to become
the Deputy Minister of Finance.

14:06.804 --> 14:10.724
I've pulled strings and set it up for you.
You have nothing to worry about.

14:10.808 --> 14:11.809
I LOVE AIRPLANES

14:11.892 --> 14:17.481
- What if it doesn't turn out like that?
- In that case, you'll have...

14:18.691 --> 14:20.609
no value whatsoever.

14:23.153 --> 14:26.574
Fine by me.
I'll wager my life, as well.

14:28.492 --> 14:32.580
- This is what you wanted, isn't it?
- I don't know about that.

14:33.163 --> 14:36.917
Now, then, Kaede, it's a bit difficult
to evaluate your worth.

14:37.501 --> 14:40.337
If you do become
the Vice Minister of Finance,

14:40.421 --> 14:42.923
then it would be
hugely profitable for us.

14:43.007 --> 14:47.219
Why don't we place your anticipated value
at ten billion yen?

14:48.137 --> 14:49.680
But then...

14:49.763 --> 14:54.059
Oh, my!
It seems we've lost the betting round.

14:55.185 --> 14:59.732
Don't give up on me like that!
My life is on the line, remember?

14:59.815 --> 15:01.984
If you lose the right to choose...

15:02.568 --> 15:05.362
Isn't there anything else we can bet?

15:05.446 --> 15:07.948
Something like... Oh, I know!

15:08.032 --> 15:11.994
Why don't we have Saotome- senpai
and Suzui- senpai  bet their lives, too?

15:13.829 --> 15:16.582
I can't place a value
in the hundred million yen range

15:16.665 --> 15:18.292
on people without fortune or status.

15:20.836 --> 15:21.962
No way.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.381
Looks like the pot is good.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.926
Kaede, what's your choice?

15:29.261 --> 15:30.638
My choice is...

15:32.723 --> 15:34.350
the stronger hand!

15:36.644 --> 15:39.104
All of the formalities have concluded.

15:39.188 --> 15:42.441
The winner will receive
the life of the losing player.

15:42.524 --> 15:45.778
I will do everything in my power
to make that a reality.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.447
There will be no escape.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.491
No matter what.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.202
No!

15:53.285 --> 15:56.455
It wasn't supposed to be like...

16:01.251 --> 16:03.128
What a pathetic woman.

16:03.212 --> 16:08.300
All Yumeko Jabami wants to do is gamble,
and she's sucked the marrow out of you.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.470
She took advantage of your deluded dreams.

16:12.471 --> 16:18.227
Being overly ambitious leads to ruin,
as they say. Don't worry, Sumeragi.

16:18.310 --> 16:23.649
I'll be glad to look after you. Just keep
pumping out money, and I'll be satisfied.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.652
All to ensure that I become
student council president

16:26.735 --> 16:29.655
and rule over Hyakkao Academy.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.032
Showdown!

16:32.741 --> 16:36.787
I know I can do it! I'll rule
over everyone and control everything!

16:39.039 --> 16:40.541
Three of a kind!

16:43.627 --> 16:45.921
All right, show your hand, Yumeko Jabami.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.299
Tossing a pair of queens,
pretending to go for a garbage hand...

16:49.383 --> 16:51.760
What do you have? A straight flush?

16:53.303 --> 16:56.557
Unfortunately, no such miracle happened.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.976
If only it had!
It would've been so dramatic!

16:59.059 --> 17:02.563
Moron! You don't have to tell me that.

17:02.646 --> 17:06.775
You couldn't have bet all that money
unless you were going for the weaker hand.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.861
But a cunning scheme
can't beat sound tactics.

17:08.944 --> 17:12.114
If I just stick to the high road,
this woman will self-destruct.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.241
What do you say, Sumeragi?

17:14.324 --> 17:17.453
Your biggest mistake
was letting Yumeko Jabami incite you!

17:18.328 --> 17:20.914
Come back to me, Itsuki Sumeragi!

17:21.707 --> 17:25.419
You think Sumeragi is doing this
just because I incited her?

17:26.503 --> 17:29.590
A patron's only job
is to bankroll a gambler.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.925
Do you really believe that?

17:32.509 --> 17:35.054
If so, you're sadly mistaken.

17:35.137 --> 17:38.682
No sane patron would do nothing
when it's her money at stake.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.101
Particularly if she put everything
on the line.

17:41.769 --> 17:46.023
At this moment,
Sumeragi is standing here as a gambler!

17:47.232 --> 17:52.654
Please take a look at my hand.
This is Sumeragi's divorce letter to you.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.658
Three of a kind... jacks?

17:59.119 --> 18:00.120
How?

18:03.123 --> 18:04.541
Three of a kind?

18:05.125 --> 18:09.338
Manyuda, you certainly seem obsessed
with the words "high road."

18:09.922 --> 18:13.717
Then what was the high road
in the case of this gamble?

18:14.301 --> 18:18.263
That's obvious! To fold.

18:18.347 --> 18:22.935
To step away from risk,
to play when you have a good hand.

18:23.018 --> 18:27.481
If you'd adhered to such tactics,
it would've drained me, as I had no funds.

18:28.273 --> 18:31.151
Whether or not I could make
my opponent take a risk...

18:31.235 --> 18:35.531
in a sense, for me, that was
a bigger issue than winning or losing.

18:36.115 --> 18:40.536
Jabami- senpai  discarded a pair of queens,
pretending to go for a high card hand.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.997
But that alone wouldn't have been enough.
If you'd folded, it would've been over.

18:44.581 --> 18:48.585
A hand so weak, I'd bet my life on it
since I'm in over my head!

18:48.669 --> 18:52.798
I couldn't drag you into this wager
until I made you believe that!

18:53.423 --> 18:58.095
If I were your only opponent, I'm sure
you would've stuck to the high road.

18:58.178 --> 19:02.975
But you helped us with this ten billion
yen wager because of Sumeragi.

19:03.058 --> 19:07.646
It was because of Sumeragi's presence that
you left the high road and went astray.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.857
What are you saying?

19:09.940 --> 19:12.025
Three of a kind... jacks?

19:12.109 --> 19:17.364
Betting your life on an iffy hand...
There's no way you could do such a thing!

19:17.948 --> 19:21.368
Apparently, you still don't get it,
Manyuda- senpai.

19:21.451 --> 19:24.329
There's just one reason why you lost.

19:24.413 --> 19:28.500
It's because you underestimated me!
Screw you!

19:28.584 --> 19:33.213
No! Not possible!
This just isn't possible.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.966
I'm supposed to defeat this woman
and become student council president.

19:36.049 --> 19:38.302
- You put up a good fight.
- That's my worth!

19:38.385 --> 19:40.929
- I never dreamed you of all people...
- Otherwise, I...

19:41.013 --> 19:43.265
Who knew you had the nerve?

19:44.391 --> 19:49.104
Thanks to this gamble, I've discovered
everything that's alluring about you.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.231
- No...
- That's why...

19:53.108 --> 19:53.942
you're fired.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.621
"OF COURSE YOU CAN" BATTLE!

20:06.455 --> 20:08.957
He really is an idiot,
that Manyuda- senpai.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.461
With his overwhelming financial might,
the game was going his way.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.130
Disgracing himself
in front of a huge crowd...

20:15.797 --> 20:18.800
Well, that's all because
he underestimated me.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.638
Sumeragi, please don't hold back.

20:23.513 --> 20:27.100
For now, let's commend each other
on a well-fought match. Oh, my...

20:27.768 --> 20:32.064
The beauty of a person
who's expended all that he had inside him.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.818
What's with those gaudy nails, Itsuki?

20:37.736 --> 20:39.655
- Aren't they adorable?
- No good.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.908
If you're striving to become king,
you've got to dress properly.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.263
Tell me, have you ever seen a supernova?

21:04.346 --> 21:06.515
Unfortunately, no.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.643
My fervent wish is to see one for myself.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.145
The culmination
of a nuclear fusion reaction...

21:12.229 --> 21:15.440
literally, an explosion
of galactic proportions.

21:18.694 --> 21:22.322
I'm sure it must be beautiful
beyond belief.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.451
Could the same be said
for a human life?

21:26.827 --> 21:30.455
That brief sparkle
the moment a life draws to an end...

21:31.081 --> 21:34.376
It's the one thing
I can never get enough of.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.380
Isn't that because your true desires
have yet to be fulfilled?

21:39.047 --> 21:42.092
A life going up in flames
is beautiful to behold.

21:42.175 --> 21:47.014
It's a sight to see.
But what you truly desire...

21:50.017 --> 21:53.562
is to witness yourself beautifully ablaze,
until finally, you're no more.

21:55.188 --> 21:59.109
- Am I wrong about that?
- So amusing!

22:00.569 --> 22:03.739
You really are entertaining.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.575
Oh, I'm ready when you are.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.868
Really, that's so tempting.

22:07.951 --> 22:10.579
What? What are those two talking about?

22:11.288 --> 22:13.498
I don't get it. It's beyond me.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.876
You two are smoldering. You know that?

22:16.835 --> 22:20.881
Listen, if the attraction is mutual...
then there's no reason to hold back!

22:22.883 --> 22:25.552
Just be true to your heart!

22:25.635 --> 22:27.637
I'll be happy to bear witness!

22:28.972 --> 22:30.265
Oh, please! How embarrassing!

22:31.850 --> 22:35.979
Runa! Are you trying to seduce us, too?

22:36.563 --> 22:40.567
President, please tell me!
What on earth are you planning to do?

22:41.485 --> 22:42.319
Naturally...

22:43.487 --> 22:44.863
To risk everything...

22:46.031 --> 22:47.324
...on a gamble!

24:19.583 --> 24:22.502
- Yumeko... leave the academy?
- I don't intend to cheat.

24:22.586 --> 24:25.130
- Of course not.
- Our money's on you, Yumeko!

24:25.213 --> 24:28.425
- Let's get started.
- Now... let's get our gambling freak on.

24:28.508 --> 24:30.927
