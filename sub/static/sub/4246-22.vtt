WEBVTT

00:03.247 --> 00:05.897
Billy... chambers?

00:05.899 --> 00:08.449
Billy chambers is the mole?!

00:08.451 --> 00:11.706
If i had stabbed someone to
death in cold blood

00:11.708 --> 00:13.520
With a pair of scissors
and got away with it,

00:13.522 --> 00:14.962
I'd skip town
and never be heard from again.

00:14.964 --> 00:16.843
Huck?
Billy chambers had to go.

00:16.845 --> 00:18.891
And you made me promise
i wouldn't kill him...

00:20.605 --> 00:22.753
So i hired out.

00:22.755 --> 00:24.532
Oh! Hold the elevator!

00:24.534 --> 00:27.855
Whatever you're getting paid
to do this, i'll double it!

00:27.857 --> 00:30.173
I know. Oh, wait. Stop!
Stop! Please, stop!

00:30.175 --> 00:31.750
Think of me as
an investment strategy!

00:31.752 --> 00:34.537
Okay, i was the vice president's
chief of staff.

00:34.539 --> 00:35.847
I have all her access codes.

00:35.849 --> 00:39.103
And i know where a hell of
a lot of bodies are buried.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.916
So i was gonna retire
a rich man

00:40.918 --> 00:42.158
Based on all the secrets
i have to sell,

00:42.160 --> 00:44.038
But there's no reason
that i can't share.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.590
I mean, my access,
your skill set...

00:46.592 --> 00:48.605
We'd make a great team.

00:48.607 --> 00:50.215
It's true what they say. If you
want someone killed right,

00:50.217 --> 00:51.928
You've gotta kill them yourself.

00:51.930 --> 00:54.379
Somebody stitch that
on a pillow.

00:54.381 --> 00:58.308
Give it to me. No, i hold the cytron
card. I hold it till we use it.

00:58.310 --> 00:59.885
It's mine.

00:59.887 --> 01:01.900
Tell me you're not gonna
blow this for us, rosen.

01:01.902 --> 01:04.150
I'm not gonna blow this.

01:04.152 --> 01:05.324
<i>I'm not.</i>

01:06.971 --> 01:09.387
<i>Again, i don't see why
we are here.</i>

01:09.389 --> 01:11.267
We're here
because we are moments...

01:11.269 --> 01:13.349
This administration
is moments...

01:13.351 --> 01:14.960
We have to stop billy chambers
from outing defiance.

01:14.963 --> 01:16.774
From a full-Scale
nuclear meltdown.

01:16.776 --> 01:18.183
I am no longer a member
of this administration.

01:18.185 --> 01:19.392
Let's say we get this show
on the road.

01:19.394 --> 01:21.070
Not everyone's here yet.

01:21.072 --> 01:22.481
What the heck we waitin' for,
old verna to show?

01:22.483 --> 01:24.026
'Cause the last time
i checked,

01:24.028 --> 01:25.570
That little piggy was dead
as a slab of bacon,

01:25.572 --> 01:29.572
Right, of course. You have your own lofty agenda now.
I've been a team player ever since he ran for governor

01:31.078 --> 01:35.078
Or whatever greener pastures you believe you are headed
off to... to manage whatever crisis after crisis...

01:35.174 --> 01:39.174
Because that is where all of us are going to be... i
am looking out for one person now and one person only,

01:39.538 --> 01:41.215
<i>And that person is me! If we
don't... Where are you going?!</i>

01:41.217 --> 01:44.237
Sit... down... mellie.

01:49.072 --> 01:50.448
Let's do this.

01:52.449 --> 01:53.449
<i>Season 2, Episode 22: White Hats Back On</i>

01:58.105 --> 01:59.580
We've all had our differences
in the past,

01:59.582 --> 02:01.125
But tonight,
we're put them aside.

02:01.127 --> 02:03.609
We do what we have to do
to fix this.

02:03.611 --> 02:07.302
This billy chambers character
has got to go... Permanently.

02:07.304 --> 02:09.787
I mean,
bang-Bang, boo-Hoo, bye-Bye.

02:09.788 --> 02:11.164
Sir.

02:12.306 --> 02:15.427
Hollis, this is the white house.
This man is the president.

02:15.429 --> 02:16.771
Talking about murder
in the white house

02:16.773 --> 02:19.960
Talking about sex in the vatican
in front of the pope.

02:19.962 --> 02:22.344
<i>We do nodo it.</i>

02:22.346 --> 02:23.989
Well, la-Di-Da.

02:23.991 --> 02:26.440
If wouldn't be the president if
i hadn't made him the president.

02:26.442 --> 02:29.495
Do whatever you have to do,
but leave me out of it.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.711
No more blood.

02:31.713 --> 02:35.338
This has gone far enough.

02:36.648 --> 02:39.668
Billy chambers is not
our problem.

02:39.670 --> 02:41.783
Defiance is our problem.
It always has been.

02:41.785 --> 02:43.932
And the only way to prove
that defiance has happened

02:43.934 --> 02:45.107
Is the cytron card.

02:45.109 --> 02:49.109
And we put this whole thing
to bed once and for all.

02:49.541 --> 02:52.527
Liv's right.
We get the card back.

02:54.578 --> 02:57.497
If you would just be willing
to sit down and talk with him...

02:57.499 --> 03:00.954
<i>He's going to run again, and he
knows he needs you by his side</i>

03:00.956 --> 03:02.162
When he does.

03:02.164 --> 03:04.983
I will not be humiliated
anymore!

03:04.985 --> 03:07.333
He wants to come back.
I promise you.

03:07.335 --> 03:10.960
He just doesn't know how to
do it. He's a child, mellie.

03:10.962 --> 03:13.645
We just have to show him
the way.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.070
You okay?

03:17.072 --> 03:18.883
It's a lot,

03:18.885 --> 03:20.729
This whole
billy chambers thing.

03:20.731 --> 03:22.106
And having to deal
with hollis...

03:22.108 --> 03:23.718
He's not so bad. Not really.

03:26.104 --> 03:28.183
Liv?
We'll fix this defiance thing,

03:28.185 --> 03:29.895
And you'll run again
and you'll win.

03:29.897 --> 03:31.339
And i want that.
I want that for you.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.488
It's just... i let myself
believe the waiting was over.

03:33.490 --> 03:34.865
And now...
The waiting?

03:34.867 --> 03:36.946
Four more years
is going to be difficult.

03:36.948 --> 03:39.263
I'll be fine. It's just...

03:39.265 --> 03:40.572
It's going to
be difficult.

03:40.574 --> 03:42.082
We're not waiting
four more years to be together.

03:42.084 --> 03:43.426
We're gonna be together now.

03:43.428 --> 03:46.078
Livvie, i'm running.
I'm winning.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.421
We're getting married,

03:47.423 --> 03:50.040
And you are moving into
the white house with me.

03:50.042 --> 03:51.988
Fitz, okay,

03:51.990 --> 03:54.909
There's a million reasons
why that's a nonstarter...

03:54.911 --> 03:57.997
Are you seriously going
to stand here and suggest that

03:57.999 --> 04:00.280
Divorcing your wife and moving
me into the white house

04:00.282 --> 04:03.436
In the midst of an election
is not a tiny bit of a problem?

04:03.438 --> 04:04.678
It's a problem.
Clearly.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.357
So fix it.
Funny.

04:06.359 --> 04:09.244
You're a funny man. You should
quit your job, go on the road.

04:09.246 --> 04:11.595
What are you always saying?

04:11.597 --> 04:14.079
That you're brilliant,
that you're the best,

04:14.081 --> 04:15.825
Better than my boys
in the white house.

04:15.827 --> 04:19.115
So... do what you do best.

04:19.117 --> 04:21.096
<i>Fix it. Handle it.</i>

04:21.099 --> 04:23.144
I thought you didn't
want me fixing you.

04:23.146 --> 04:25.159
I don't need fixing.
I'm fine. I love you.

04:25.161 --> 04:27.408
The american public
needs fixing.

04:27.410 --> 04:28.583
They love mellie.

04:28.585 --> 04:29.758
They're the ones
with the problem.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.705
So come up with a plan
to solve it.

04:31.707 --> 04:33.888
<i>You want me to come up
with a plan.</i>

04:33.890 --> 04:37.212
Olivia pope...

04:38.624 --> 04:40.704
Use your superpower.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:52.053 --> 04:54.637
Mmm. Stop. We can't.

04:54.639 --> 04:56.350
Someone will come in.

04:56.352 --> 04:59.538
Okay, fitz.
What are you doing?

04:59.540 --> 05:01.821
<i>Using my superpower.</i>

05:15.153 --> 05:18.542
It's time
i meet with ms. Pope.

05:18.544 --> 05:20.791
May i ask what for?

05:20.793 --> 05:22.000
I need to talk to her.

05:22.002 --> 05:23.914
You are not
the best conversationalist.

05:23.916 --> 05:26.868
Maybe it's the company i keep.
Just bring her in.

05:26.870 --> 05:28.682
I can't do that.

05:28.684 --> 05:29.856
And why is that?

05:29.858 --> 05:32.711
Can you at least tell me...

05:32.713 --> 05:35.261
I just wanna know
your intentions.

05:36.641 --> 05:38.182
Bringing ms. Pope in...
It's a job.

05:38.184 --> 05:40.399
It's a task you are free
to accept or decline.

05:40.401 --> 05:42.749
You refuse the job,
i ask someone else,

05:42.751 --> 05:44.428
And i'll know where we stand.

05:59.369 --> 06:02.927
Now, james, you know
the grant family intimately.

06:02.929 --> 06:05.076
The president is
your daughter's godfather.

06:05.078 --> 06:06.922
What's your take on the rumors

06:06.924 --> 06:08.467
That the first couple's
seeing a pastor

06:08.469 --> 06:09.911
To repair their marriage?

06:09.913 --> 06:11.086
You're freezing me out.

06:11.088 --> 06:12.261
That's not true.
Oh, really?

06:12.263 --> 06:13.940
Then how'd "the post"
find out that

06:13.942 --> 06:14.914
The president's seeking counsel
from pastor jennings?

06:14.916 --> 06:16.558
I don't know.
Is it true?

06:16.560 --> 06:18.707
I don't know.
Why don't you ask "the post"?

06:18.709 --> 06:20.688
They seem to be all sourced up.

06:20.690 --> 06:22.736
They're all sourced up
because you are their source.

06:22.738 --> 06:24.717
And i don't have sources
because you're freezing me out!

06:24.719 --> 06:26.295
So in the next 20 minutes,

06:26.297 --> 06:27.671
When every other reporter
in this building goes live

06:27.673 --> 06:31.096
An exploratory committee
to run against the president

06:31.098 --> 06:32.573
In next year's
republican primary,

06:32.575 --> 06:36.166
I would like to have a comment
from the oval!

06:36.168 --> 06:38.214
Your job has only
two requirements, sally.

06:38.216 --> 06:39.389
One is to not die.

06:39.391 --> 06:41.571
The other is to be loyal
to the president.

06:41.573 --> 06:44.190
That's it! Don't die!
Be loyal!

06:44.192 --> 06:45.634
The only other creature
in this white house

06:45.636 --> 06:48.555
Who has the same sweet deal
is the president's dog!

06:48.557 --> 06:52.315
<i>Hank! Hank can do those two
simple things! Why can't you?!</i>

06:52.317 --> 06:54.598
I have a constituency,
people that i answer to.

06:54.600 --> 06:55.941
People who almost made me

06:55.943 --> 06:57.586
The standard bearer
of this party three years ago.

06:57.588 --> 06:59.298
<i>Almost, sally. Almost!</i>

06:59.300 --> 07:01.347
And when they see the goings-On
in this white house,

07:01.349 --> 07:03.764
Its lack of discipline,
its lack of... beliefs.

07:03.766 --> 07:05.610
Oh, we're singing that song
again, are we?

07:05.612 --> 07:07.323
Morality isn't
a minor inconvenience, cyrus.

07:07.325 --> 07:09.471
Scrape off the bottom
of your shoe

07:09.473 --> 07:11.015
And then continue on
your merry way.

07:11.017 --> 07:12.963
Commandments of the lord
are being broken.

07:12.965 --> 07:14.743
So at this point,
with this president,

07:14.745 --> 07:15.984
I would be irresponsible

07:15.986 --> 07:19.409
If i didn't offer the party
an alternative.

07:20.619 --> 07:22.129
Billy chambers has
the cytron card.

07:22.131 --> 07:24.915
We need it back. So we need to
figure out what his game is,

07:24.917 --> 07:26.124
How he's going to use it.

07:26.126 --> 07:27.837
Billy's got no credibility
in d. C.

07:27.839 --> 07:29.918
After the vice president
disavowed him.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.093
So if he wants to out defiance,

07:31.095 --> 07:32.470
He knows he can't do it
by himself.

07:32.472 --> 07:33.142
He needs someone else
to do it for him.

07:33.143 --> 07:34.686
The question is, who?

07:34.688 --> 07:35.962
Billy needs someone respectable,
someone with clout,

07:35.964 --> 07:37.942
Someone who has
the public's trust

07:37.944 --> 07:40.863
Who was directly affected
by defiance.

07:42.241 --> 07:43.281
Ms. Pope.

07:43.283 --> 07:46.235
Governor.
Thank you for seeing me.

07:46.237 --> 07:47.780
Please.

07:47.782 --> 07:49.358
I think billy's going to use
reston to out defiance.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.935
I think they're already
working together.

07:50.937 --> 07:53.387
But we don't have any proof.
All we have is... My gut.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.636
I'm sure.
How can you be sure?

07:55.638 --> 07:57.348
Abby, you should've seen him.
I'm sure.

07:57.350 --> 08:00.135
I was just wondering if you were
planning to run again.

08:00.137 --> 08:03.962
Believe me, i think i've gotten
the bug out of my system

08:03.964 --> 08:05.709
After the last election.

08:05.711 --> 08:06.482
What if you're wrong?

08:06.483 --> 08:08.394
I'm not. I know this.

08:08.396 --> 08:10.375
But we knew that
grayden osborne was the mole,

08:10.377 --> 08:12.961
We knew that molly was a victim,
and we were wrong.

08:12.963 --> 08:14.068
You could be wrong here.

08:14.070 --> 08:15.948
<i>I'm not.</i>

08:15.950 --> 08:17.291
Make sure you...
I did.

08:17.293 --> 08:19.238
Don't forget...
All right there. I got this.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.018
<i>I wouldn't go that way.
I got this.</i>

08:21.020 --> 08:23.335
Quinn...
Boom! There it is.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.853
There what is? I hacked
into the security cameras

08:25.855 --> 08:29.042
If billy chambers went
to see him there, we'll know.

08:29.044 --> 08:31.393
It's downloading now. We should
have it in under two minutes.

08:31.395 --> 08:32.568
I need coffee.

08:32.570 --> 08:33.607
Boom.

08:37.571 --> 08:38.947
She's getting good at this.

08:38.948 --> 08:40.289
You're a good teacher.

08:40.292 --> 08:41.498
Sometimes, uh,

08:41.500 --> 08:44.722
Sometimes she reminds me
of me.

08:46.670 --> 08:48.583
Are you saying...

08:48.585 --> 08:50.261
Has she hurt anyone?
No.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.504
Then what are you saying?

08:51.506 --> 08:53.552
I'm saying
i worry about her.

08:54.728 --> 08:58.118
Like i worry about you.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.293
Don't worry about me.

08:59.295 --> 09:01.777
I worry about you,

09:01.779 --> 09:04.564
<i>With him.</i>

09:07.151 --> 09:09.432
He wants me by his side
in the white house.

09:09.434 --> 09:11.816
He wants to get a divorce.
I'm gonna be first lady.

09:11.818 --> 09:15.543
I wrote a plan. I was up
all night. I handled it.

09:20.513 --> 09:23.399
I worry about me, too.

09:23.401 --> 09:25.313
Okay, security cameras are up.

09:29.948 --> 09:31.323
There.

09:31.325 --> 09:32.901
We got him.

09:32.903 --> 09:33.975
Billy chambers
at the governor's mansion,

09:33.977 --> 09:35.016
Two hours ago.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.582
They're on to you.

09:39.584 --> 09:43.040
But may i remind you that,
unlike you, i serve the king?

09:43.042 --> 09:44.820
Which makes me
a busy, busy man.

09:44.822 --> 09:46.902
And today, i am busier than
busy, so... I'm sure you are.

09:46.904 --> 09:48.580
I wish i could be
more sympathetic, cyrus.

09:48.582 --> 09:50.796
But you have a tendency to
make things harder for yourself

09:50.798 --> 09:52.240
<i>Than they need to be.</i>

09:52.242 --> 09:55.731
The sex tape? It can make
all of our problems go away.

09:55.733 --> 09:57.544
But you still refuse. Why?

09:57.546 --> 10:00.096
I'm still unclear why
any of this matters to b613.

10:00.098 --> 10:01.741
You know how people say,
"i could tell you

10:01.743 --> 10:02.983
But then i would have to
kill you" at parties,

10:02.985 --> 10:06.576
<i>I could tell you, but then
i would have to kill you.</i>

10:06.578 --> 10:09.329
We're not at a party,
and i am not laughing.

10:09.331 --> 10:11.141
These are two people in love.
These are my friends.

10:11.143 --> 10:14.163
Cyrus,
i'm handling olivia pope.

10:14.165 --> 10:15.909
You do your part.

10:15.911 --> 10:17.958
What does that mean?

10:17.960 --> 10:19.771
Worry about your boss.

10:19.773 --> 10:22.120
I'll take care of the rest.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.135
What do you mean a...

10:24.137 --> 10:26.485
About olivia pope?

10:26.487 --> 10:29.306
Drop the bomb already, cy.

10:32.967 --> 10:34.812
What?

10:34.814 --> 10:36.894
It's reston.
What's reston?

10:36.896 --> 10:38.337
Billy chambers.
He's working with reston.

10:38.339 --> 10:40.822
I don't know what
their plans are yet.

10:40.824 --> 10:42.836
<i>Reston? Are you...</i>

10:42.838 --> 10:44.481
<i>Reston?!</i>

10:44.483 --> 10:46.025
He's in the oval.

10:46.027 --> 10:47.368
They're meeting
in the oval office right now.

10:47.371 --> 10:48.544
Governor reston.

10:48.546 --> 10:51.531
You know, i've been riding
your senators for months

10:51.533 --> 10:53.512
Trying to get 'em on board
with my education bill, so...

10:53.515 --> 10:55.158
This isn't about education.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.669
It's about defiance.

10:56.671 --> 10:59.691
You need to get in there.
You need to stop this!

11:13.691 --> 11:16.075
Oh, my god.

11:16.077 --> 11:18.559
Someone call 9-1-1!

11:18.561 --> 11:20.205
Take his shirt off.
That's fine.

11:26.651 --> 11:28.698
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.646
Put me on your ticket.
Excuse me?

11:30.648 --> 11:32.794
Put me on your ticket,
and this all goes away.

11:32.796 --> 11:36.723
The proof i have that you rigged
a national election.

11:36.725 --> 11:38.267
I think you better leave.

11:38.269 --> 11:40.718
And go where, to the feds?
Draw me a map. I'll walk.

11:40.720 --> 11:41.893
Put "the post" on there.

11:41.895 --> 11:43.740
Hell, put all the newspapers
on there.

11:43.742 --> 11:47.742
<i>Of voter fraud in the history
of american politics.</i>

11:48.678 --> 11:51.093
You clearly think you've figured
something out, governor.

11:51.095 --> 11:54.719
<i>I don't think anything,
mr. President.</i>

11:54.721 --> 11:55.893
<i>I know.</i>

11:55.895 --> 11:59.895
And i know your way out now
is to bring me on board.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.172
We'll call it
the unity ticket...

12:02.174 --> 12:05.059
Two old rivals coming together
to make america right.

12:05.061 --> 12:07.846
You'll have to fire langston,
of course, but let's be honest.

12:07.848 --> 12:09.894
Rumor is,
is that bible thumper's been

12:09.896 --> 12:13.252
Making a play to jump ship
anyway.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.602
I'll show myself out.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.952
9 a. M. Tomorrow, mr. President.

12:17.954 --> 12:20.167
That's when this offer expires.

12:30.007 --> 12:31.885
Reston. What did he say?

12:31.887 --> 12:34.067
Mr. President, i have mr. Beene
on the phone.

12:34.069 --> 12:36.283
Okay.

12:36.285 --> 12:39.204
Cyrus. Okay, what did reston
say? What did he say to you?

12:39.206 --> 12:41.756
What did you tell him? Mr. Beene, at
least let me take your blood pressure.

12:41.758 --> 12:44.240
It's bad! Very bad! How's that?
What did he say?

12:44.242 --> 12:45.752
He wants a deal.

12:45.754 --> 12:47.329
He won't expose defiance
if we run together

12:47.331 --> 12:50.384
Putting sally langston
out to pasture in the process.

12:50.386 --> 12:52.097
That might not be the worst...
No.

12:52.099 --> 12:53.440
<i>Reston hates you.</i>

12:53.442 --> 12:55.488
It is deep
and it is personal.

12:55.490 --> 12:57.537
So he's either planning
on using defiance

12:57.539 --> 12:59.416
To impeach you once
he's the vice president,

12:59.418 --> 13:03.211
Sometimes incriminating,
which you... Didn't, of course.

13:03.213 --> 13:04.520
Oh, thank god. Thank god.

13:04.522 --> 13:08.481
Get... Get your hands
off of me! Off!

13:08.483 --> 13:10.462
Off!
Cyrus, where are you?

13:10.464 --> 13:13.987
He's hypertensive.
Are you in an ambulance?

13:13.989 --> 13:17.110
I'm fine! These idiots are
telling me i had a heart attack.

13:17.112 --> 13:18.385
Cyrus!

13:18.387 --> 13:20.031
Ow!

13:20.033 --> 13:22.012
Shoot him.

13:22.014 --> 13:24.664
I said, shoot him! Give me
your gun. I'll shoot him myself!

13:38.633 --> 13:41.586
You bastard. Don't you die on me
when i'm so mad at you.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.231
Don't you dare die.

13:43.233 --> 13:44.473
Come here. Come here.

13:46.790 --> 13:48.300
I don't forgive you.

13:48.302 --> 13:50.752
I don't forgive you either.

13:53.908 --> 13:55.687
Please don't die.

13:55.689 --> 13:57.936
I'll do my best.

14:03.947 --> 14:07.673
Is it true the president's
seeking spiritual guidance

14:07.675 --> 14:09.654
About his marriage?

14:11.368 --> 14:13.448
Yes, it's true.

14:16.034 --> 14:17.477
I love you.

14:21.171 --> 14:23.486
It's still about the card.
It's what makes this case.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.702
Whoever's got it
calls the shots.

14:25.704 --> 14:29.127
I don't give up the card
so easily. It's my only play.

14:29.129 --> 14:30.503
I'd make sure i'd get
everything i wanted

14:30.505 --> 14:31.813
Before i handed it over.

14:31.815 --> 14:33.492
I'd negotiate.
Yeah, negotiations take time.

14:33.494 --> 14:36.110
And as long as billy
is negotiating...

14:36.112 --> 14:38.192
Reston doesn't have the card.
Billy does.

14:38.194 --> 14:40.274
Look, rosen, i get that
you have your whole

14:40.276 --> 14:42.322
"What i've done
for this memory card" thing.

14:42.324 --> 14:45.243
I do. But i can't hold out
any longer.

14:45.245 --> 14:47.593
Reston couldn't get grant
to confess on tape,

14:47.595 --> 14:49.103
So let's be a big boy.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.622
You want this as bad as i do.
It's time. Cough it up.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.233
I can't.

14:53.235 --> 14:56.121
Not yet. I will. I just...

14:56.123 --> 14:58.840
They're my friends.

15:00.017 --> 15:01.324
And i'm not.

15:01.326 --> 15:03.943
Right? Your friend?
Is that it?

15:03.945 --> 15:05.353
<i>I'm the bad guy?</i>

15:05.355 --> 15:07.838
Well, you did kill
some people.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.926
Okay. I've got some blood
on my hands.

15:10.928 --> 15:14.184
But i had good reasons.
I had to get rid of the cia guy.

15:14.186 --> 15:18.186
And that wendy girl...
Which i know i framed you for...

15:18.886 --> 15:21.435
She screwed things up,
so she had to die.

15:21.437 --> 15:23.887
Same with molly.
I didn't have a choice, okay?

15:23.889 --> 15:27.889
I was forced to do all of it
by your so-Called friends.

15:28.018 --> 15:31.440
And, yes, i'll burn in hell
for what i did. I will.

15:31.442 --> 15:35.442
But you? You don't have to
end up like me.

15:36.513 --> 15:39.498
You could get some justice for
those thousands of ohio voters

15:39.500 --> 15:42.386
Who lost their fundamental right
of one man, one vote...

15:42.388 --> 15:45.576
For samuel reston, who won that
damn presidency fair and square.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.523
And for you...
You lost your job,

15:47.525 --> 15:49.336
Your reputation, and your sense
of right and wrong

15:49.338 --> 15:50.712
When you fell in
with these people.

15:50.715 --> 15:52.089
And let's be honest.

15:52.091 --> 15:54.171
<i>Olivia pope
and her team of thugs?</i>

15:54.173 --> 15:56.352
<i>They are not
anyone's friends.</i>

15:56.354 --> 15:58.670
<i>They destroyed your life!</i>

15:58.672 --> 16:00.650
<i>She destroyed your life.</i>

16:00.652 --> 16:02.396
And, yeah, yeah, she'll end up
fixing it for you.

16:02.398 --> 16:06.398
<i>But only because she's the one
who broke it in the first place!</i>

16:07.501 --> 16:10.420
<i>She took your life from you!</i>

16:10.422 --> 16:13.610
<i>She took justice from you!
Remember?</i>

16:13.612 --> 16:15.826
Well, she did the same thing to
me, and look what i've become!

16:15.828 --> 16:17.438
I was the vice president's
chief of staff,

16:17.440 --> 16:19.787
And now
i'm a freakin' murderer.

16:19.789 --> 16:23.381
So come on, rosen. Wake up.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.596
Smell the justice.

16:28.753 --> 16:30.967
You're right.

16:30.969 --> 16:33.049
You're damn right.

16:40.671 --> 16:42.450
You want me to put reston
on the ticket?

16:42.452 --> 16:43.961
No, i want you to pretend to.

16:43.963 --> 16:45.673
We've all been assuming that
reston has the memory card.

16:45.675 --> 16:49.669
What if billy chambers is
holding on to the card himself?

16:49.671 --> 16:52.590
Do you know where he's hiding? No, but if
we can force reston to reach out to him...

16:52.592 --> 16:53.967
By taking the deal.
By taking the deal,

16:53.969 --> 16:57.055
If i'm right
and reston doesn't have it...

16:57.057 --> 17:00.983
And we'll trace his call
and track chambers down.

17:02.965 --> 17:04.979
President grant's
very interested in this idea

17:04.981 --> 17:08.605
A chance to end the era
of petty bipartisan bickering

17:08.607 --> 17:09.779
And start fresh.

17:09.781 --> 17:11.324
The president's
also quite concerned

17:11.326 --> 17:14.915
With these suggestions of
voter irregularities in ohio?

17:14.917 --> 17:16.663
That's right. Good memory.

17:16.665 --> 17:17.972
Any alleged proof
of such activities

17:17.973 --> 17:20.087
Would need verification
before any further steps

17:20.089 --> 17:22.169
Toward a unity ticket
could be taken, of course.

17:22.171 --> 17:24.250
What kind of proof
do you want?

17:24.252 --> 17:26.836
Whatever... proof
there might be.

17:28.113 --> 17:30.461
I'll see what i can do
about that.

17:30.463 --> 17:33.046
It's done.

17:33.048 --> 17:34.256
I'm into reston's
cell phone.

17:34.258 --> 17:35.867
Now we just
wait and see

17:35.869 --> 17:37.177
If he calls billy
for the card.

17:37.179 --> 17:39.325
<i>What i can confirm is</i>

17:39.327 --> 17:42.111
<i>The president is talking
to his pastor.</i>

17:42.113 --> 17:43.422
<i>He is seeking counsel.</i>

17:43.424 --> 17:45.268
<i>He is praying for guidance,</i>

17:45.270 --> 17:47.014
<i>Which is a good sign,
and his approval numbers</i>

17:47.016 --> 17:48.390
<i>Are on the rise as a result,</i>

17:48.392 --> 17:50.337
<i>While the first lady's
are trending down,</i>

17:50.339 --> 17:52.352
<i>With more people now
questioning her trustworthiness</i>

17:52.354 --> 17:54.232
<i>After her decision
to air her dirty laundry</i>

17:54.234 --> 17:55.710
<i>On live tv.</i>

17:57.357 --> 18:01.048
Ohh... cyrus.

18:01.050 --> 18:03.129
Thank god you're all right.

18:03.131 --> 18:05.513
Thank you. What are
you doing here, mellie?

18:05.515 --> 18:08.401
Officially? I've come to visit
cyrus in his hour of need.

18:08.403 --> 18:11.087
Now, i know you don't want
cameras in the room, cy,

18:11.089 --> 18:12.799
But they got me coming in,
so i was thinking,

18:12.801 --> 18:14.646
When fitz and i go down
in the elevator together,

18:14.648 --> 18:16.492
Maybe we can let a little
press into the lobby...

18:16.494 --> 18:17.768
I'm not leaving here
with you.

18:17.770 --> 18:20.320
Our approval ratings
are up, fitz.

18:20.322 --> 18:23.475
If you plan to run and win,

18:23.477 --> 18:26.497
We need to capitalize
on the public's support.

18:26.499 --> 18:29.351
Mellie, this phase
of our lives,

18:29.353 --> 18:32.507
Capitalizing on public support
as a definition of marriage,

18:32.509 --> 18:33.783
Is over.

18:33.785 --> 18:36.234
Make no mistake...

18:36.236 --> 18:38.719
You are going to leave
the white house.

18:38.721 --> 18:41.673
You'll want
your own political career.

18:41.675 --> 18:44.627
And i will back you
and campaign for you

18:44.629 --> 18:46.877
And never speak
of my ex-Wife mellie grant

18:46.879 --> 18:49.798
In anything but the most
glowing of terms.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.644
And then, about a year
into my second term,

18:51.646 --> 18:53.793
I will go one or two
high-Profile dates

18:53.795 --> 18:57.452
With well-Educated,
age-Appropriate career women,

18:57.454 --> 18:59.030
Which will be chronicled
in immaculate detail

18:59.032 --> 19:00.843
By tabloids
around the globe.

19:00.845 --> 19:02.724
And when word leaks
six months later

19:02.726 --> 19:05.141
That i've been spending time
with one of my oldest,

19:05.143 --> 19:06.887
Dearest,
most trusted advisors,

19:06.889 --> 19:08.901
Who selflessly acted
as the mouthpiece

19:08.903 --> 19:10.815
Of my administration when i was
lying half-Dead

19:10.817 --> 19:13.065
On a hospital bed, who has
always stood beside me

19:13.067 --> 19:14.811
As my friend and colleague...

19:14.813 --> 19:16.825
When it gets out
that she and i have started,

19:16.827 --> 19:19.276
After all this time, to care
for one another in a way

19:19.278 --> 19:20.922
That is no longer
strictly professional,

19:20.924 --> 19:22.869
America will love her.

19:22.871 --> 19:25.320
And let's be honest.

19:25.322 --> 19:27.737
My relationship with olivia

19:27.739 --> 19:29.684
Is going to spark
a real dialogue

19:29.686 --> 19:33.686
And it is going to blow
the republican party wide open

19:34.252 --> 19:36.365
And let some light and air
into places

19:36.367 --> 19:38.984
That haven't seen change
in far too long.

19:38.986 --> 19:42.275
So the party will love her.

19:42.277 --> 19:44.490
And you want to be on
the right side of history here.

19:44.492 --> 19:45.967
Trust me, you do.

19:45.969 --> 19:49.225
Now... if you don't want
to play along,

19:49.227 --> 19:53.186
If you leak olivia's name,
if you refuse to go gently,

19:53.188 --> 19:55.972
Well, it only takes a few
whispers of the word "racist"

19:55.974 --> 19:58.122
Before the feminist groups
and the religious groups

19:58.124 --> 19:59.834
And even the republican
national committee

19:59.836 --> 20:02.150
Turn up their noses
at your stink.

20:02.153 --> 20:05.037
But i don't want
to do that, mellie.

20:05.039 --> 20:07.421
I want to help you join me
as a living,

20:07.423 --> 20:10.443
Breathing monument to redemption
and second chances

20:10.445 --> 20:14.036
And the america we all hope
still exists.

20:30.220 --> 20:33.777
I take it liv
came up with that?

20:35.423 --> 20:37.369
She did.

20:40.661 --> 20:42.809
It's good.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.613
Reston's calling an aide,

20:52.615 --> 20:54.358
Telling him to order pizza.

20:54.360 --> 20:57.011
Sausage, deep dish, large.

20:57.013 --> 20:59.696
20,736.
What?

20:59.698 --> 21:01.711
That's how many possible
combinations there are

21:01.713 --> 21:02.987
To this safe.

21:02.989 --> 21:04.733
It would take days
to go through them all.

21:04.735 --> 21:06.714
Charlie cracked it in minutes
with a gun to david's head.

21:06.716 --> 21:09.668
Doesn't add up. Ugh.
Super spy. Look at huck.

21:09.670 --> 21:10.977
Reston just
called billy.

21:10.979 --> 21:14.979
He's asking for the card. We
were right. Billy still has it.

21:15.613 --> 21:17.658
His signal's coming
from a cell tower in virginia.

21:17.660 --> 21:19.572
Looks like rosslyn.
This is it.

21:19.574 --> 21:20.782
We got him?
We got him.

21:20.784 --> 21:22.661
Super spy.

21:30.115 --> 21:33.774
Stress. It's a killer.

21:33.776 --> 21:35.655
Wh...

21:35.657 --> 21:37.702
What do you want
with olivia pope?

21:48.011 --> 21:50.663
Rowan?

21:52.947 --> 21:54.222
How's he looking?

21:54.224 --> 21:55.967
Pale, fragile.

21:55.969 --> 21:57.847
Did you tell him my plan?

21:57.849 --> 21:58.989
He heard it.

21:58.991 --> 22:00.936
It's a brilliant plan,
liv.

22:00.938 --> 22:04.126
He'll get on board.
I'll make him get on board.

22:05.805 --> 22:07.114
What?

22:07.116 --> 22:09.129
He wants you and mellie
back together

22:09.131 --> 22:10.840
If you're
going to run again.

22:10.842 --> 22:13.023
He planted the stories about you
seeing the pastor, didn't he?

22:13.025 --> 22:16.514
You're worried
about him.

22:16.516 --> 22:18.428
You love him.
You don't want him to die.

22:18.430 --> 22:20.543
I feel the same way, but that
doesn't change the fact

22:20.545 --> 22:22.894
That he's still cyrus.

22:22.896 --> 22:24.572
Put your hand too close
to the cage,

22:24.574 --> 22:26.285
<i>And he will bite it off.</i>

22:28.971 --> 22:31.288
Do you want
to come here to sleep?

22:31.290 --> 22:33.973
I wish i could, but the agents
i trust aren't on tonight.

22:33.975 --> 22:35.619
What will you do instead?

22:35.621 --> 22:38.976
I have a very exciting life,
mister. I don't need you.

22:42.637 --> 22:44.247
Bye.

23:11.376 --> 23:13.692
I checked the whole place.
I can't find the card.

23:13.694 --> 23:16.244
It was worth a shot. When
do you think he'll be back?

23:16.246 --> 23:17.721
I don't know.
This part is quiet.

23:17.723 --> 23:19.467
We're quiet here.
Sit down, okay?

23:19.469 --> 23:20.910
Okay.
Wait, his cell signal put him

23:20.912 --> 23:22.555
At the chinese place
down the street.

23:22.557 --> 23:24.704
So he's gonna be back
any minute.

23:24.706 --> 23:25.845
Which is why we're quiet.
Sit down.

23:25.847 --> 23:27.323
Then again,
maybe it's not takeout.

23:27.325 --> 23:29.438
Maybe he likes...
Sit... down.

23:37.397 --> 23:38.504
I got it. I'm good.

23:52.135 --> 23:54.082
Liv, what are you...

23:54.084 --> 23:56.163
Is she... She's okay. She'll be okay.

24:01.704 --> 24:03.248
What was that?

24:05.128 --> 24:06.638
Drink.

24:06.641 --> 24:08.351
What was that, jake?
I need a minute.

24:08.353 --> 24:10.768
I need a minute.

24:13.926 --> 24:15.872
Okay.

24:15.874 --> 24:17.315
Listen.

24:17.317 --> 24:18.793
Do not leave your office
tonight.

24:18.795 --> 24:20.404
You need to stay here
with your people.

24:20.406 --> 24:22.822
You'll be safe here...
i think. You're leaving?

24:22.824 --> 24:24.299
You'll be safer when i'm gone. Jake!

24:24.301 --> 24:26.850
Why is someone
trying to kill me?

24:26.853 --> 24:28.496
I don't know exactly why
or the details.

24:28.498 --> 24:31.013
I just follow orders.
But i do know that as long

24:31.015 --> 24:32.189
As you're in a relationship

24:32.191 --> 24:34.035
With the president
of the united states,

24:34.037 --> 24:36.049
You're in danger.

24:36.051 --> 24:37.157
There's a branch of the cia
called b613.

24:37.159 --> 24:40.045
B6...

24:41.087 --> 24:42.529
You're b613.

24:42.531 --> 24:43.939
Hey.

24:43.941 --> 24:45.383
Stay here tonight.

24:45.385 --> 24:48.103
The woman i shot at your place
was a b613 agent,

24:48.105 --> 24:49.647
Which means by morning
they'll have collected her body.

24:49.649 --> 24:51.931
Fix your door,
hire security,

24:51.933 --> 24:53.240
Or break up
with your boyfriend.

24:53.242 --> 24:54.516
Wait.
I have to go.

24:54.518 --> 24:58.175
Because you saved me. No,
because i disobeyed orders.

24:58.177 --> 25:00.458
Maybe i c... I could
help you get out.

25:00.460 --> 25:01.734
In my world,
there are no outs.

25:01.736 --> 25:03.245
Wait. Just wait!

25:03.247 --> 25:05.259
You can't just...

25:06.235 --> 25:09.187
You saved my life
twice now.

25:09.189 --> 25:11.807
I was... i was wrong.

25:11.809 --> 25:13.719
I was wrong about you.
You're one of the good guys.

25:13.721 --> 25:15.432
No, i'm not.

25:16.709 --> 25:19.662
I just followed my orders.

25:19.664 --> 25:21.576
Sleeping with you

25:21.578 --> 25:23.658
Was my mission.

25:24.902 --> 25:26.579
So don't bother
missing me.

25:37.694 --> 25:39.002
Close your eyes.

25:43.837 --> 25:46.488
Close...

25:46.490 --> 25:48.100
Your...

25:48.102 --> 25:49.544
Eyes.

26:14.927 --> 26:17.646
Be safe.

26:17.648 --> 26:18.686
Good-Bye, olivia.

26:34.702 --> 26:36.749
What's going on, liv?

26:39.169 --> 26:41.081
This just got real.

26:49.072 --> 26:50.179
You're all right.

26:50.181 --> 26:51.354
Cyrus.

26:53.035 --> 26:55.886
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you in the hospital?

26:55.888 --> 26:58.001
Cyrus...

26:58.003 --> 27:01.158
So i sent a secret service
agent over to your house.

27:01.160 --> 27:03.609
He saw your door was broken.
I was worried.

27:03.611 --> 27:05.623
Someone tried to kill me
tonight.

27:08.545 --> 27:10.290
Liv...

27:10.292 --> 27:12.371
You ever hear of b613, cy?

27:14.286 --> 27:16.972
There are things i'm not
at liberty to discuss

27:16.974 --> 27:19.087
Or acknowledge on the basis
of national security.

27:19.089 --> 27:20.363
You know what?
Don't say anything.

27:20.365 --> 27:22.275
It doesn't matter anyway.

27:22.277 --> 27:24.156
I know who it was,
and i know why,

27:24.158 --> 27:25.432
And i don't care.

27:25.434 --> 27:27.413
Fitz and i are going
to be together.

27:28.656 --> 27:29.830
I'm sorry. What?

27:29.832 --> 27:32.181
I'm going to be with him,
cyrus.

27:32.183 --> 27:33.859
We have a plan.
It's going to work.

27:33.861 --> 27:36.276
I love him.

27:36.278 --> 27:37.619
Let me get this straight.

27:39.400 --> 27:42.622
Highly trained
black ops assassins

27:42.624 --> 27:44.871
Broke into your home
and tried to kill you.

27:44.873 --> 27:47.355
And instead of that, oh,
making you run toward reason,

27:47.358 --> 27:49.673
Instead of the possibility
of death

27:49.675 --> 27:52.358
Making you decide that maybe
it's better to be single,

27:52.360 --> 27:55.548
Were merely firing
heart-Shaped bullets...

27:55.550 --> 27:57.428
Made of bubbles and candy
that signified

27:57.430 --> 28:00.853
That you and boyfriend fitzy are
m. F.E.O., made for each other?

28:00.855 --> 28:03.673
Cyrus, you're being
dramatic.

28:03.675 --> 28:05.620
Really?!

28:05.622 --> 28:07.601
Really?

28:07.603 --> 28:10.657
I'm being dramatic?
I'm being... dramatic?

28:10.659 --> 28:14.048
I've moved heaven and earth
to save you from yourselves.

28:14.050 --> 28:15.793
I have lied for you,
i have stolen for you,

28:15.795 --> 28:17.607
I have cheated for you,
i have killed for you,

28:17.609 --> 28:19.755
I have almost died for you,
and you...

28:19.757 --> 28:23.045
You two are so stupid
and romantic

28:23.047 --> 28:24.557
And high on your own
doomed-Love,

28:24.559 --> 28:26.571
Romeo-And-Juliet,
"dear diary" nonsense

28:26.573 --> 28:27.913
That you won't even
save your own lives,

28:27.915 --> 28:29.760
But i am being dramatic?!

28:29.762 --> 28:32.178
Romeo and juliet
were teenagers, and they died!

28:32.180 --> 28:33.755
I've had enough!
Cyrus...

28:33.757 --> 28:36.878
He killed verna thornton,
liv!

28:36.880 --> 28:40.067
Killed her! Dead!
With his own two hands!

28:41.109 --> 28:42.586
What?

28:42.588 --> 28:43.928
Oh, you didn't know?

28:43.930 --> 28:46.782
You were too "i love him
and he loves me

28:46.784 --> 28:48.796
And our love... "
no!

28:48.798 --> 28:50.878
"Conquers every obstacle
in our paths... "

28:50.880 --> 28:51.886
To find that part out?

28:51.888 --> 28:53.295
Whoever told you that...

28:53.297 --> 28:54.874
He did! He told me that!

28:54.876 --> 28:57.761
The love of your life
is a red-Handed,

28:57.763 --> 28:58.903
Cold-Blooded killer.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.078
That is what you're
dealing with!

29:00.080 --> 29:01.857
That...

29:01.859 --> 29:04.241
Is who you love.

29:18.914 --> 29:21.934
This is not a romance novel.

29:24.050 --> 29:26.064
Life is not a romance novel.

29:33.151 --> 29:34.390
Hi, billy.

29:34.392 --> 29:38.185
We need to talk
about the cytron card, okay?

29:45.505 --> 29:47.250
What the hell
are you doing here, cy?

29:47.252 --> 29:50.809
They just let you go?
You yell at enough doctors,

29:50.811 --> 29:52.823
They'll sign anything.

29:52.825 --> 29:55.341
May i?
What is that?

29:57.256 --> 29:58.463
Reality tv.

30:15.387 --> 30:16.694
Huck.

30:16.696 --> 30:18.440
I can't do it. I thought
i could, but i can't.

30:18.442 --> 30:20.690
It's okay. It's okay, huck.
You don't have to.

30:20.692 --> 30:22.436
Oh, but she needs the card.
Olivia needs the card.

30:22.438 --> 30:24.316
It's okay.
You don't have to do it.

30:24.318 --> 30:25.591
It's okay.

30:25.593 --> 30:28.546
It's okay. It's okay.

30:28.548 --> 30:30.661
Okay.

30:52.991 --> 30:56.782
Where's the damn
cytron card, billy?!

30:59.672 --> 31:01.046
I'm not gonna
ask you twice.

31:24.817 --> 31:28.817
Abby, i got it.
864, 864. It's 864.

31:36.033 --> 31:37.945
Huck installed
an emulator program.

31:37.947 --> 31:39.052
Turns his laptop
into a facsimile

31:39.054 --> 31:42.510
Of a voting machine.

31:47.682 --> 31:49.191
Did you do it right?

31:49.193 --> 31:51.039
Huck wrote out
all the keystrokes for me.

31:51.041 --> 31:52.046
It was idiot-Proof.

31:53.289 --> 31:55.201
There's nothing on this.

31:55.203 --> 31:56.343
It's fake.

31:56.345 --> 31:57.753
This card is fake.

31:57.755 --> 32:00.742
That's the card he gave me!

32:00.744 --> 32:04.300
I swear to god, that's the card
david rosen gave me.

32:05.207 --> 32:08.195
It's david.
David played us.

32:11.150 --> 32:12.459
I didn't know where else
to put him.

32:12.461 --> 32:14.473
He's safest here.

32:14.475 --> 32:16.622
Oh, come on.

32:20.316 --> 32:22.565
Good night, david.
Enjoy the couch.

32:22.567 --> 32:23.941
Always.

33:18.233 --> 33:21.655
David rosen, i just read
that grand jury transcript.

33:22.900 --> 33:24.945
Man, did you get screwed.

33:48.785 --> 33:50.093
Turn it off.

33:50.095 --> 33:51.939
There's more.
I don't care. Turn it off.

33:51.941 --> 33:55.230
It goes from room to room
and back again...

33:55.232 --> 33:57.915
I don't think
you wanna do this.

33:57.917 --> 34:00.299
I'm an old man.
I did just have a heart attack.

34:08.963 --> 34:12.554
Plus...
as far as i can tell,

34:12.556 --> 34:16.045
I'm the only grown-Up
in the room.

34:22.157 --> 34:25.043
Mr. President,
david rosen has our world

34:25.045 --> 34:27.159
<i>Spinnin'
on his itty-Bitty thumb again.</i>

34:27.161 --> 34:29.777
Boy's been a tick on our ass
for over a year now,

34:29.779 --> 34:31.087
And it's about time
the son of a bitch was handled

34:31.089 --> 34:33.335
For once and for all.

34:35.351 --> 34:37.331
What in the pouty hell
is with you people tonight?

34:37.333 --> 34:41.159
This boy has the only remaining
proof of our deeds in defiance.

34:41.161 --> 34:44.248
Into the justice department
this very second.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.934
No. He's in my office...

34:46.936 --> 34:48.478
Right now.

34:51.367 --> 34:52.842
What can i do for you?

34:52.844 --> 34:56.844
<i>It's what i...
can do for you.</i>

35:01.406 --> 35:05.406
Oh, and i'm going to need
something in return.

35:14.132 --> 35:17.520
<i>I can't. Not yet.
I will. I just...</i>

35:17.523 --> 35:19.568
They're my friends.

35:19.570 --> 35:21.751
<i>And i'm not.</i>

35:21.753 --> 35:25.645
Your friend? Is that it?

35:25.647 --> 35:27.055
I'm the bad guy.

35:27.057 --> 35:29.507
And did you see his face
when i was all...

35:29.509 --> 35:31.151
"Where's the cytron card?"

35:31.153 --> 35:32.763
I didn't hesitate.
I didn't even blink.

35:32.765 --> 35:34.576
I just... i just bam!
Right in his thigh.

35:34.578 --> 35:37.161
It was such a rush.
I've never been on drugs,

35:37.163 --> 35:38.572
But i feel like
i'm on something.

35:38.574 --> 35:42.574
I am, like, fully awake
right now. Huck?

35:46.665 --> 35:49.986
<i>Okay, i've got
some blood on my hands,</i>

35:49.988 --> 35:51.732
<i>But i had good reasons.</i>

35:51.734 --> 35:55.734
<i>And that wendy girl,
which i know,</i>

35:56.838 --> 35:59.320
<i>I framed you for...
She screwed things up,</i>

35:59.322 --> 36:01.334
<i>So she had to die.
Same with molly.</i>

36:01.336 --> 36:02.912
It's not often
that i have the honor

36:02.914 --> 36:06.371
Of standing next
to a true american hero.

36:06.373 --> 36:09.425
This one man, david rosen,
has succeeded

36:09.428 --> 36:11.810
Where our justice
and intelligence departments

36:11.812 --> 36:13.085
Have failed.

36:13.087 --> 36:15.604
David rosen found the mole...

36:15.606 --> 36:16.980
The mole responsible
for the death

36:16.982 --> 36:19.297
Of cia director osborne.

36:19.299 --> 36:20.942
The mole responsible
for selling our secrets

36:20.944 --> 36:22.184
And endangering the lives

36:22.186 --> 36:24.367
Of our cia operatives
in the field.

36:24.369 --> 36:27.120
The mole who previously,
as a chief of staff

36:27.122 --> 36:28.664
For the vice president,

36:28.666 --> 36:30.612
Bitterly attempted and failed

36:30.614 --> 36:33.297
To disgrace this administration
into ruin.

36:33.299 --> 36:36.554
Thanks to mr. Rosen,
that man is now in custody

36:36.556 --> 36:40.556
And will answer
for his treasonous crimes.

36:40.652 --> 36:42.563
It is with great pride
that i announce

36:42.565 --> 36:44.813
That david will be
the new u. S. Attorney

36:44.815 --> 36:47.063
For the district of columbia,

36:47.065 --> 36:48.842
Where i expect he will continue
to fight for justice.

36:48.844 --> 36:50.857
David.

36:50.859 --> 36:54.147
<i>Olivia pope
and her team of thugs...</i>

36:54.149 --> 36:56.463
<i>They are not
anyone's friends.</i>

36:56.465 --> 36:59.216
<i>They destroyed your life,
rosen.</i>

36:59.218 --> 37:01.836
<i>She destroyed your life,</i>

37:01.838 --> 37:03.413
<i>And, yeah, yeah, she'll end up
fixing it for you.</i>

37:03.415 --> 37:04.454
<i>She'll break out
the krazy glue,</i>

37:04.456 --> 37:05.898
<i>But only because she's the one</i>

37:05.900 --> 37:09.222
<i>Who broke it
in the first place!</i>

37:32.960 --> 37:34.436
You and jake.

37:37.157 --> 37:38.633
Cyrus told you?

37:38.635 --> 37:40.681
Yes.

37:40.683 --> 37:41.924
I thought so.

37:44.476 --> 37:46.053
He told me about verna.

38:04.956 --> 38:07.205
I was going to tell you
that i don't care about jake,

38:07.207 --> 38:11.207
That... i forgive you,

38:11.236 --> 38:15.236
That... That we could start over,
start fresh. No big deal.

38:15.768 --> 38:19.056
I'm guessing you don't feel
the same way about murder.

38:21.273 --> 38:24.127
I wish that i could say
that i didn't mean to do it,

38:24.129 --> 38:28.129
Or that i was out of my mind
or that it was an accident.

38:28.795 --> 38:31.445
I wish i could say anything.

38:36.617 --> 38:38.630
Liv?

38:46.554 --> 38:50.554
The things we've done
to get you here...

38:52.700 --> 38:54.309
We went too far.

38:54.311 --> 38:56.424
Olivia, i'm sorry. If you'll
give me another chance...

38:56.426 --> 38:59.782
Whatever happened in the past,
let it go.

38:59.784 --> 39:02.736
Let your father go.

39:02.738 --> 39:06.228
Let verna go.

39:06.230 --> 39:07.739
Defiance is dead.

39:07.741 --> 39:09.418
The reset button
has been hit.

39:09.420 --> 39:10.761
The genie
is back in the bottle.

39:10.763 --> 39:12.843
<i>You are clean.
You cstart over.</i>

39:12.845 --> 39:15.192
Start fresh. Run clean.

39:15.194 --> 39:16.636
Run with mellie
at your side.

39:16.638 --> 39:18.651
No. No,
that is not the plan.

39:18.653 --> 39:22.653
My people... Huck and abby
and harrison and quinn...

39:22.917 --> 39:26.239
I took them too far,
over the wrong cliff.

39:26.241 --> 39:27.816
We went so far that i don't know
that we can get back,

39:27.818 --> 39:31.275
But you can get back.

39:31.277 --> 39:32.651
Run with mellie
by your side.

39:32.653 --> 39:34.968
You can win with mellie
by your side.

39:34.970 --> 39:36.580
<i>I want you by my side.</i>

39:36.582 --> 39:39.669
We can do this together.

39:39.671 --> 39:41.515
You are going to be
my first lady.

39:46.854 --> 39:49.438
I can't leave them.

39:49.440 --> 39:52.125
They need me.

39:52.127 --> 39:54.844
I'm their gladiator.

41:49.602 --> 41:51.347
Alissa!

41:51.349 --> 41:53.932
Where the hell is my coffee?

42:20.861 --> 42:22.067
Is it true you are having
an affair...

42:22.069 --> 42:26.029
How long have you been
sleeping with the president?!

42:39.057 --> 42:41.943
Hello, olivia.

42:41.945 --> 42:45.200
Dad?
