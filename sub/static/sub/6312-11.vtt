00:01.230 --> 00:03.323
Previously on Elementary...
A police detective

00:03.370 --> 00:04.598
came to my house
this morning

00:04.630 --> 00:06.598
and all her questions
were about you.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.268
Did she tell you her name?
Gina Cortes.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.130
I take it you've never
used a consultant.

00:11.170 --> 00:13.138
Real cops do
the job themselves.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.772
That's how it works.

00:14.810 --> 00:16.573
You don't belong.
I don't know what
to tell you,

00:16.610 --> 00:17.804
Detective--
I'm not gomg anywhere.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.613
You want to fight me?

00:19.650 --> 00:22.141
That's how it's done, right,
when two cops have a problem

00:22.190 --> 00:23.748
with each other
and they can't resolve it?
There's a ring right there.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.519
HOLMES: You, of course,
need to work on your defense.

00:25.550 --> 00:27.609
You allowed Cortes to land
far too many punches.

00:27.660 --> 00:30.686
But all that matters is
that I landed the last one.

00:38.530 --> 00:39.599
I was looking for that.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.733
Looking for what?
Bob.

00:41.770 --> 00:44.034
Yeah, well, I found him first.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.205
What did Bob do to you?

00:46.240 --> 00:47.571
Bob didn't do anything.

00:47.610 --> 00:48.804
Someone did something.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.569
Yeah, remember Detective Cortes?

00:50.610 --> 00:52.578
Burglary Division,
6-4 squad, Coney Island,

00:52.620 --> 00:54.508
and your stalker for awhile.

00:54.550 --> 00:57.644
Yeah, well she's back.

00:57.690 --> 00:58.782
I thought you two already

00:58.820 --> 01:00.356
settled your differences
in the ring.

01:00.390 --> 01:02.187
Ah, so did I,
but then Marcus said

01:02.230 --> 01:04.357
she came by the 11th,
wouldn't say what she wanted,

01:04.390 --> 01:06.597
just said she was
looking for me.

01:06.630 --> 01:08.655
Oh, you're preparing
for a rematch.

01:08.700 --> 01:12.363
Just working out
some frustration.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.867
(sighs)

01:13.900 --> 01:16.266
I'm gonna go
by her precinct tomorrow.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.732
See how she likes it...

01:17.770 --> 01:20.477
(grunting):
when someone pops in on her.

01:21.510 --> 01:23.774
(elevator bell dings)

01:23.810 --> 01:27.712
* I'm not saying my baby's
a saint 'cause he ain't *

01:27.750 --> 01:30.446
* And that _he won't cat
around With a kitty *

01:30.490 --> 01:33.812
* I'm just a-telling you, gal,
to lay off of my man... *

01:35.360 --> 01:37.578
Don't play hard
to get with me, Eugene.

01:37.630 --> 01:39.757
NICOLE:
* I'm just a-telling you, gal

01:39.800 --> 01:41.654
* To lay off of my man...

01:41.700 --> 01:44.624
If you don't want to go
to Fist City.

01:44.670 --> 01:48.731
Oh, correct answers must
be sung, not recited.

01:48.770 --> 01:50.169
What do you got, Nicki?

01:50.210 --> 01:51.632
Omar Velez.

01:51.670 --> 01:53.604
Homeless Latino man, age 51,

01:53.640 --> 01:55.608
NICOLE: five-foot-nine,
170 pounds.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.608
Eyes green, hair brown.
Was found on a trail

01:57.650 --> 01:59.618
in Idlewild Park
around 6:00 this morning.

01:59.650 --> 02:02.141
And what brings Mr. Velez
to our fine establishment?

02:02.190 --> 02:03.589
Blood loss, organ damage,

02:03.620 --> 02:04.780
multiple lacerations

02:04.820 --> 02:06.811
in the chest and torso area,
knife wounds.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.782
Homicide, no question.

02:08.820 --> 02:10.822
Oh, we're a little
backed up today,

02:10.860 --> 02:12.691
probably won't be able to get
to this one till tomorrow...

02:12.730 --> 02:16.427
uh... we can park him in D3,
but let's get a core temp first.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.597
Way ahead of you.

02:18.630 --> 02:20.564
The detectives asked
for time of death,

02:20.600 --> 02:22.568
so I took care of that
at the crime scene.

02:22.610 --> 02:26.569
Mr. Velez drew his last breath
around 5:15 this morning.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.289
So, uh...

02:36.320 --> 02:39.756
(grunting): I don't know
if you're busy, but... I know

02:39.790 --> 02:42.452
you like hockey, uh, and, uh,

02:42.490 --> 02:43.752
I have an extra, uh,

02:43.790 --> 02:46.395
ticket to _
the Rangers game tonight.

02:46.430 --> 02:48.455
Are you asking me out, Eugene?

02:48.500 --> 02:50.491
Maybe.

02:51.770 --> 02:53.237
Meet you here at six?

02:54.470 --> 02:56.438
Deal.

02:56.470 --> 03:00.702
* Well, I was born
a coal miner's daughter *

03:00.740 --> 03:04.176
* In a cabin on a hill in...

03:05.710 --> 03:07.940
*

03:13.690 --> 03:15.749
(indistinct radio transmissions)
HAWES: H was with Nicole

03:15.790 --> 03:17.849
and then-then there was
this sound and then...

03:17.890 --> 03:20.256
she was gone.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.756
Let's get him to the hospital.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.789
No, no hospital.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.821
I'm a witness. I want to help.

03:24.870 --> 03:26.895
You sure it was a bomb,
not some gas line thing?

03:26.940 --> 03:29.500
It was a bomb.
Based on the damage here,

03:29.540 --> 03:31.804
it was about the size
of a loaf of bread.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.774
D-Do you remember anything

03:33.810 --> 03:35.698
out of place?
Anything out of the ordinary?

03:35.740 --> 03:37.776
No, I was here all morning.

03:37.810 --> 03:39.641
The only other person
I saw was Nicole.

03:39.680 --> 03:42.786
The blast pattern emanates
from inside the body cooler.

03:42.820 --> 03:43.946
It was either
planted there...

03:43.990 --> 03:46.515
Or someone hid it
inside a body.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.516
She was here to drop one off,
was she not?

03:48.560 --> 03:49.822
Homeless guy.

03:49.860 --> 03:52.624
Omar... uh, Omar something.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.891
Um, Velez.
Uh, he had a lacerated torso.

03:55.930 --> 03:57.522
Big enough
for a loaf of bread?

03:57.570 --> 04:00.459
If you removed
a few organs, yeah.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.764
Doesn't make any sense.
Why blow up a morgue?

04:02.810 --> 04:04.402
The best guess
is the bomber wanted

04:04.440 --> 04:05.862
to hide the evidence
of a homicide.

04:05.910 --> 04:07.707
You know,
blow up a few bodies,

04:07.740 --> 04:09.901
don't have to worry about
what turns up in an autopsy.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.804
Sombra Roja.

04:11.850 --> 04:13.772
What?

04:13.820 --> 04:14.878
Sombra Roja.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.547
The cartel-- we got five

04:16.590 --> 04:18.410
Honduran gang members
down here the other day.

04:18.450 --> 04:19.883
That shoot-out at Port Morris?

04:19.920 --> 04:21.512
_ Narcotics are sure
It was Sombra R0ja.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.425
They were hoping
the autopsies could turn up

04:23.460 --> 04:25.280
something concrete. I'll pull
the files, there's got to be

04:25.330 --> 04:26.922
some evidence we _can...
No, we can get It.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.757
You need to go
to the hospital.

04:31.030 --> 04:32.759
Do me a favor.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.530
Don't be too careful
when you make the arrests.

04:35.570 --> 04:36.901
People who did this...

04:37.940 --> 04:39.305
...they belong down here.

04:44.810 --> 04:48.473
How familiar are you two
with Sombra Roja?

04:48.520 --> 04:51.887
The Red Shadow are a recent
arrival from Zacatecas.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.057
This would not be
the first time

04:53.090 --> 04:54.751
that they've used explosives,
however,

04:54.790 --> 04:56.052
in their short tenure
in New York.

04:56.090 --> 04:57.819
Yeah, they were responsible

04:57.860 --> 04:59.828
for a car bomb that killed
a judge in Brooklyn.

04:59.860 --> 05:01.794
Yeah, the FBI is still building
their case,

05:01.830 --> 05:03.627
but, yeah, that's them.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.661
I'm gonna call the Feds,
see if they can point us

05:05.700 --> 05:07.463
to anyone specific.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.003
While I endorse the cartel's
candidacy for this crime,

05:10.040 --> 05:12.008
I don't think we should put
all our eggs in one basket,

05:12.040 --> 05:13.109
so you assist the Captain.

05:13.140 --> 05:14.630
I'll enlist Detective Bell

05:15.910 --> 05:17.343
Because the person
who killed him

05:17.380 --> 05:18.404
is probably the same one

05:18.450 --> 05:19.872
who put a bomb in his gut.

05:26.150 --> 05:28.880
So, this is where
Omar Velez's body

05:28.920 --> 05:30.558
was discovered.

05:30.590 --> 05:31.818
Apparently, the jogger
who found it

05:31.860 --> 05:34.420
almost tripped,
it was so close to the path.

05:34.460 --> 05:35.893
Well, you don't go through
the trouble of stuffing a body

05:35.930 --> 05:37.727
full of explosives
and then risk it

05:37.770 --> 05:39.533
not being found, do you?

05:40.740 --> 05:42.503
How's Hawes?

05:42.540 --> 05:45.566
He's not good.

05:45.610 --> 05:47.737
The woman who died
was Important to him.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.668
Nicole. Yeah, I worked
with her a couple times.

05:49.710 --> 05:51.575
She was nice.

05:52.820 --> 05:53.878
What is it?

05:56.490 --> 05:57.912
Hold this for me, would you?

06:03.660 --> 06:05.855
*

06:35.220 --> 06:37.029
(phone ringing)

06:40.960 --> 06:42.996
What the hell are you doing?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.036
There's some police tape
over here

06:47.070 --> 06:49.561
and footprints
from police-issued boots.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.202
At some point
in the last 48 hours...

06:51.240 --> 06:54.573
this was an active crime scene.

06:54.610 --> 06:55.872
A crime scene?

06:55.910 --> 06:56.979
Just 30 yards from where

06:57.010 --> 06:58.546
Omar Velez was found
this morning?

06:58.580 --> 07:00.411
A coincidence, no?

07:01.680 --> 07:02.749
I think it would behoove us

07:02.790 --> 07:04.439
to find out what happened here.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.793
Detective Cortes,

07:14.830 --> 07:16.627
maybe you hadn't heard,
but a bomb went off

07:16.670 --> 07:18.069
in an OCME building today.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.136
In about 15 minutes,
I am meeting my captain,

07:20.170 --> 07:22.092
and an attorney for a drug
cartel we think is responsible.

07:22.140 --> 07:24.563
So, if you don't mind
tabling this whole

07:24.610 --> 07:26.066
I-cost-your-friend-a-job
thing,

07:26.110 --> 07:27.975
I will happily kick your ass
at another time.

07:28.010 --> 07:30.979
Actually, I came here
to ask for your help.

07:31.010 --> 07:32.773
I did hear about the bomb,

07:32.820 --> 07:34.811
but I didn't know you
were working it.

07:34.850 --> 07:36.078
I guess I should have figured.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.008
You and your partner get
whatever you want, right?

07:38.050 --> 07:41.156
Sorry I bothered you.

07:41.190 --> 07:42.657
What do you want my help with?

07:43.890 --> 07:45.482
Case.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.920
I'm trying to get
my hands on a suspect,

07:48.960 --> 07:51.099
only no one seems
to know where he is.

07:51.130 --> 07:52.495
It's been weeks now,

07:52.540 --> 07:54.531
and I actually got
desperate enough

07:54.570 --> 07:55.969
to come see you.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.675
I thought real cops
didn't use consultants.

07:59.710 --> 08:01.974
Like I said, I'm desperate.

08:02.010 --> 08:05.047
This is my last stop
before the psychic.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.719
But, hey,
you've got your hands full,

08:07.750 --> 08:10.583
so I'll let you know how it goes
on the crystal ball circuit.

08:12.990 --> 08:14.059
Leave the file.

08:14.090 --> 08:16.149
I'll look at it when I can.

08:23.100 --> 08:26.695
Why on Earth would you think
my client would bomb a morgue?

08:26.740 --> 08:28.560
Because he is the head
of Sombra Roja,

08:28.600 --> 08:29.760
and because the bodies

08:29.810 --> 08:31.801
of five murdered
Honduran gangsters

08:31.840 --> 08:33.205
were destroyed in that blast.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.935
Bodies that his men
put there.

08:34.980 --> 08:37.198
We think autopsies
would produce some evidence

08:37.250 --> 08:38.945
that your client didn't
want revealed.

08:38.980 --> 08:41.119
GREGSON: Now, normally,
he wouldn't care

08:41.150 --> 08:42.708
if any of his underlings
went down.

08:42.750 --> 08:43.978
They never talk
when they're captured,

08:44.020 --> 08:45.214
and it's easy enough

08:45.250 --> 08:47.286
to _rotate new sicarios
into the country.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.049
But the men that killed
those Hondurans,

08:49.090 --> 08:52.025
they weren't just
any underlings now,

08:52.060 --> 08:53.755
were they?

08:53.800 --> 08:58.123
We know Mr. Barranco's nephews,
Justino and Angel,

08:58.170 --> 08:59.660
arrived in town last week.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.099
We also know
that they have a few notches

09:01.140 --> 09:04.132
on their belts.

09:04.170 --> 09:05.967
WATSON: Your client
might not blow up

09:06.010 --> 09:08.001
a morgue to protect
his foot soldiers, but family

09:08.040 --> 09:09.177
is different.

09:09.210 --> 09:11.576
My client and his nephews
are businessmen.

09:11.610 --> 09:14.215
Look at their bank statements,
their tax returns.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.047
It's all above board.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.742
Oh, I'm sure there's not
a comma out of place.

09:18.790 --> 09:20.189
You're good at what you do.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.159
And so is the FBI.

09:23.190 --> 09:25.886
And they're pretty sure
that Sombra Roja

09:25.930 --> 09:29.024
used a car bomb
to assassinate Judge Malthus

09:29.060 --> 09:32.029
in Park Slope last year

09:32.070 --> 09:33.697
right in front of a fund-raiser

09:33.740 --> 09:35.093
for the bar association.

09:35.140 --> 09:36.368
One theory

09:36.400 --> 09:38.834
that occurred to us
was that another guest

09:38.870 --> 09:41.703
distracted the judge
while the bomb was planted.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.241
You were there
that night, right?

09:43.280 --> 09:47.068
Would you like the NYPD
to publically investigate

09:47.120 --> 09:48.940
that theory, Mr. Rivera?

09:48.980 --> 09:50.845
Let me ask you something
about that car bomb.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.141
Was it made of commercial,

09:52.190 --> 09:54.055
plastic explosives,
like this...

09:54.090 --> 09:56.012
device... that went off
at your morgue?

09:56.060 --> 09:57.220
No.

09:57.260 --> 09:58.727
Maybe that's because

09:58.760 --> 10:00.022
commercial, plastic explosives

10:00.060 --> 10:01.049
are some of the most
regulated substances

10:01.100 --> 10:02.795
in the country.

10:02.830 --> 10:05.025
You need a license
to get anywhere near them.

10:05.070 --> 10:06.367
Records are kept.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.334
It's all very traceable.

10:08.370 --> 10:10.099
I imagine most cartels
are smart enough

10:10.140 --> 10:11.209
to avoid the stuff.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.036
Maybe.

10:12.070 --> 10:15.335
Maybe scumbags
make mistakes sometimes.

10:15.380 --> 10:16.904
Let's assume,

10:16.950 --> 10:20.875
for a moment, your morgue
hadn't exploded.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.114
Imagine it turned out

10:22.150 --> 10:25.278
autopsies were completed
on the dead Hondurans.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.118
And imagine, it turned out
that one of those men

10:28.160 --> 10:30.048
wasn't a Honduran at all.

10:30.090 --> 10:31.751
Maybe he was a...

10:31.790 --> 10:33.394
rogue member of Sombra Roja.

10:33.430 --> 10:35.421
A man who exchanged gunfire

10:35.460 --> 10:37.428
with the other four,
then died at the scene.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.734
If that were true,

10:39.770 --> 10:41.397
this attack on the Hondurans
would be a closed loop,

10:41.440 --> 10:45.262
and Sombra Roja certainly
wouldn't have had any reason

10:45.310 --> 10:46.231
to bomb a morgue.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.908
(phone chirps)

10:47.940 --> 10:49.202
That's an awfully specific
hypothetical,

10:49.240 --> 10:50.901
not to mention,

10:50.950 --> 10:52.941
a convenient one.

10:52.980 --> 10:56.245
Then let's not_ call it
a hypothetical.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.009
Let's call it a fact.

10:58.050 --> 10:59.210
I can utilize

10:59.250 --> 11:01.753
certain resources to...

11:02.730 --> 11:03.924
...help you identify

11:03.960 --> 11:05.928
the Sombra Roja soldier.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.257
You'll see
I'm telling the truth.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.653
(phone chirping)

11:12.230 --> 11:13.731
(sighs)

11:13.770 --> 11:14.998
Will you excuse me a moment?

11:19.470 --> 11:22.268
You know you pulled me
out of a meeting, right?

11:22.310 --> 11:24.449
On general principle
you needn't worry

11:24.480 --> 11:26.107
about being rude
to a cartel lawyer,

11:26.150 --> 11:27.947
and certainly
not in this case.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.448
I no longer believe
that Sombra Roja was involved,

11:30.490 --> 11:33.948
or that the bombing
was about the slain Hondurans.

11:33.990 --> 11:35.059
Then who was it about?

11:35.090 --> 11:38.150
This young woman.

11:38.190 --> 11:41.091
Her remains were
amongst those deCImated

11:41.130 --> 11:43.360
this morning.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.766
Detective Bell and I
have just returned from...

11:45.800 --> 11:47.233
Idlewild Park.

11:47.270 --> 11:50.398
While standing here,

11:50.440 --> 11:53.079
at the site Omar Velez's
body was discovered,

11:53.110 --> 11:54.998
I noticed police tape
on the other side

11:55.040 --> 11:56.200
of this creek,

11:56.240 --> 11:57.946
here.

11:57.980 --> 12:00.073
Imagine my surprise
discovering

12:00.120 --> 12:02.270
a second crime scene.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.187
It seems that this young
woman was strangled,

12:05.220 --> 12:08.849
her body sunk,
only to pop up two days ago.

12:08.890 --> 12:11.450
I'm surprised
we didn't hear about that.

12:11.490 --> 12:13.094
Well, we probably would have,

12:13.130 --> 12:16.827
were it not for the fact
that this creek

12:16.870 --> 12:20.294
separates Idlewild Park
from North Woodmere Park.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.228
It also happens to be the border

12:22.270 --> 12:23.498
between Queens County

12:23.540 --> 12:25.098
and Nassau County.

12:25.140 --> 12:27.108
She and Omar Velez

12:27.140 --> 12:29.279
were discovered a stone's throw
from one another,

12:29.310 --> 12:31.198
but their cases were not linked

12:31.250 --> 12:33.468
thanks to a cruel trick
of municipal geography.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.887
So, Omar Velez landed
with the NYPD,

12:36.920 --> 12:39.912
while Nassau County
handled her death,

12:39.960 --> 12:42.258
but if she was found
outside our jurisdiction,

12:42.290 --> 12:43.518
what was she doing
in our morgue?

12:43.560 --> 12:46.256
Nassau County's
small facility was full,

12:46.290 --> 12:47.848
thanks to a multi-car pile-up

12:47.900 --> 12:49.356
on the L.I.E. a few days ago.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.096
The_overflow had been
gomg to Mr. Hawes.

12:52.130 --> 12:53.939
Nassau police bagged
her hands at the scene.

12:53.970 --> 12:56.564
It appears she scratched
her attacker before she died.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.409
So his DNA was under her nails?

12:58.440 --> 13:00.078
Presumably.

13:00.110 --> 13:02.203
He tried, and failed,
to sink her body.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.470
Once she was discovered,
he had a problem.

13:04.510 --> 13:06.307
So, he sliced up Velez,

13:06.350 --> 13:07.476
stuffed a bomb inside him,

13:07.520 --> 13:09.147
and then dumped him
at the same site.

13:09.180 --> 13:11.182
He assumed the body
of his second victim

13:11.220 --> 13:13.279
would go to the same
morgue as the ﬁrst.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.289
The bomb would destroy,
or contaminate,

13:16.320 --> 13:17.856
any evidence
that led back to him.

13:17.890 --> 13:21.451
Whatever remained
would be inadmissible.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.128
He inadvertently
calculated correctly.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.592
Omar Velez was a dead end,

13:25.630 --> 13:28.030
but if we can figure out

13:28.070 --> 13:30.061
who wanted her dead,
we'll have our bomber.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.168
Precisely.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.336
Okay, so who was she?

13:32.370 --> 13:34.429
I have no idea. No one does.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.004
That's the problem.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.348
She's a Jane Doe.

13:44.050 --> 13:46.109
GREGSON: Okay,
so we don't know her name.

13:46.150 --> 13:47.981
What do we know about her?

13:48.020 --> 13:50.329
She was strangled, beat up
pretty good before that.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.850
Somebody was angry.

13:51.890 --> 13:54.097
Severe bruising
on the legs and hips.

13:54.130 --> 13:57.861
Looks like she was repeatedly
kicked or punched.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.868
The water was frigid--
I can personally attest to that.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.037
So exact time of death

14:01.070 --> 14:01.832
was difficult to ascertain.

14:01.870 --> 14:03.565
But the best guess
is she was killed

14:03.610 --> 14:05.259
somewhere_in the 48 hours
prior to being discovered.

14:05.310 --> 14:08.029
And she doesn't turn up
on any missing persons lists?

14:08.080 --> 14:10.105
Her name remains unknown.

14:10.150 --> 14:13.119
Her number, however,
appears to be three.

14:13.150 --> 14:15.539
You don't think
this could be a serial?

14:15.580 --> 14:17.138
Some creep numbering his victims

14:17.190 --> 14:18.509
before he dumps them.

14:18.550 --> 14:19.949
That's a fear. Nassau detectives

14:19.990 --> 14:21.480
have been making lists of crimes

14:21.520 --> 14:22.509
with similar characteristics,

14:22.560 --> 14:23.879
looking for any overlap

14:23.930 --> 14:25.181
with what happened to Jane Doe,

14:25.230 --> 14:26.424
but I took a look.

14:26.460 --> 14:28.098
Didn't see a pattern yet.

14:28.130 --> 14:30.291
Her name was
Janet of the Apes.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.939
That's her.

14:37.370 --> 14:39.304
It's got to be.
How did you...

14:39.340 --> 14:41.638
I treated a girl in the ER
once who needed stitches

14:41.680 --> 14:43.341
after a roller derby match.

14:43.380 --> 14:45.598
Her hips were covered
in bruises like those.

14:45.650 --> 14:48.210
I was about to call social
serwces when she told me

14:48.250 --> 14:51.014
it was from all the "checking"
she did on the track.

14:51.050 --> 14:52.586
She had a number
on her arm, too.

14:52.620 --> 14:54.656
Players have to write them
there so the refs

14:54.690 --> 14:56.317
can tell them apart.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.351
This isn't some message
from a serial killer,

14:58.390 --> 15:00.153
it's our Jane Doe's
roller derby number.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.122
Well, if she has
a roller derby number,

15:02.160 --> 15:03.559
sheWIhave
roller derby teammates.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.567
We should go visit

15:04.600 --> 15:07.091
the Bombastic Brooklyn Bettys.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.698
* Glory, glory

15:08.740 --> 15:10.935
* A change in the wind

15:10.970 --> 15:12.699
* Oh, hallelujah

15:12.740 --> 15:14.708
* We all insane...

15:14.740 --> 15:17.948
You can almost smell
the estrogen, can't you?

15:17.980 --> 15:19.971
Perhaps instead of a ring,

15:20.020 --> 15:21.317
you and Detective Cortes
could settle

15:21.350 --> 15:23.238
your differences here,
on wheels.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.679
Actually, I don't think
there's going to be a rematch.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.278
She came by the station
this morning.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.958
Turns out _she wants
my help With a case.

15:28.990 --> 15:30.423
What sort of a case?

15:30.460 --> 15:33.099
There's been a rash _
of home inva5ion robberies

15:33.130 --> 15:34.722
in her precinct.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.694
She thinks someone named
Hector Mendoza is responsible.

15:36.730 --> 15:38.266
She wants my help
to find him.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.063
Why your help?

15:40.100 --> 15:42.295
I don't know, maybe because
I'm good at what I do?

15:43.470 --> 15:44.960
What?

15:45.010 --> 15:47.331
Well, until this morning,
she was your enemy.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.699
She's not an enemy.
I don't have enemies.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.276
I'm not like you.

15:51.710 --> 15:53.018
You think
she's messing with me again?

15:53.050 --> 15:54.745
I think,
based on your description,

15:54.780 --> 15:56.316
she's the kind of woman
who holds grudges.

15:56.350 --> 15:57.988
She's also been known to employ

15:58.020 --> 15:59.487
unorthodox methods
of harassment.

15:59.520 --> 16:02.080
So, how is finding a criminal
a method of harassment?

16:02.120 --> 16:04.224
Your assuming Hector Mendoza
is a criminal.

16:04.260 --> 16:05.557
He might be
an undercover policeman,

16:05.590 --> 16:07.524
or a very good friend
of the mayor's.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.653
I'm just saying,
proceed with caution.

16:12.070 --> 16:14.664
WOMAN:
Oh, my God, that's Janet.

16:14.700 --> 16:17.032
Janet Heffernan.
Someone killed her?

16:17.070 --> 16:18.367
A few days ago.

16:18.410 --> 16:19.661
Did you know her well?

16:19.710 --> 16:21.029
No, none of us did.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.570
She only joined the team
a few weeks ago.

16:22.610 --> 16:24.009
Did anything about her

16:24.050 --> 16:26.268
jump out at you,
anything unusual?

16:28.620 --> 16:30.087
Yes?

16:30.120 --> 16:31.678
I tweaked my knee
a few weeks ago.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.187
Janet told me she could

16:33.220 --> 16:34.687
sell me some ow for the pain.

16:34.720 --> 16:37.280
So, she was a drug dealer?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.558
I don't know.

16:38.590 --> 16:41.252
I told her I was fine, but...

16:41.300 --> 16:43.097
yeah, maybe.

16:43.130 --> 16:45.690
Would you have Ms. Heffernan's
address, by any chance?

16:45.730 --> 16:47.789
We've got medical releases
for everybody.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.296
Wait here
and I'll get hers for you.

16:49.340 --> 16:51.137
Thank you.

16:52.710 --> 16:54.337
HOLMES:
What about Cyclone Joan?

16:57.410 --> 17:00.049
Joan of Bark?

17:00.080 --> 17:02.640
Janet left her computer signed
in to an e-mail account,

17:02.680 --> 17:04.739
but it looks like it was
just for work.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.781
I see messages but...

17:06.820 --> 17:08.788
they're just from oxy clients,
no one else.

17:08.820 --> 17:12.153
Joan Cold Killer, perhaps?

17:12.190 --> 17:16.024
Will you stop it with
the roller derby names for me?

17:18.170 --> 17:19.398
Swat-son.

17:20.600 --> 17:22.295
What is that?

17:22.340 --> 17:24.535
A container of garlic salt,
rather suspiciously hidden

17:24.570 --> 17:27.698
beneath the sink
in the bathroom.

17:27.740 --> 17:29.037
Oh.

17:32.810 --> 17:35.711
Not the stash of a kingpin.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.412
I would wager Ms. Heffernan
was rather a small player

17:38.450 --> 17:39.815
in the oxycodone game.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.386
I think you're right.
It looks like she only

17:41.420 --> 17:43.149
had about a dozen customers.

17:43.190 --> 17:44.726
In the case of murdered
drug dealers,

17:44.760 --> 17:48.093
drug buyers
make excellent suspects.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.757
I don't know.
Most of these messages

17:49.800 --> 17:50.869
are just working out logistics

17:50.900 --> 17:52.788
for really small transactions.

17:52.830 --> 17:54.593
I mean, it's possible
that Janet was killed

17:54.640 --> 17:58.167
over a hundred bucks,
but take a look at this.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.508
This was sent six days ago
to Toby Dannon.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.804
Looks like
one of her regulars.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.469
"Dude, Dylan says he saw you

18:05.510 --> 18:07.171
"leaving my parking lot
last night.

18:07.220 --> 18:11.111
I swore you were never here,
but he's super mad."

18:11.150 --> 18:12.310
So, since she doesn't only have

18:12.350 --> 18:15.808
multiple clients,
she has multiple men.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.680
Well, there aren't any e-mails

18:17.730 --> 18:19.527
to or from a Dylan
in this account,

18:19.560 --> 18:21.289
but he sounds like
a jealous boyfriend.

18:21.330 --> 18:24.891
Perhaps Toby Dannon will know
something about the night

18:24.930 --> 18:26.818
he was cuckolding.

18:26.870 --> 18:28.132
That's if Mr. Dannon
hasn't already

18:28.170 --> 18:29.569
been strangled
and left in a creek.

18:30.840 --> 18:33.172
You know, I saw his address...

18:33.210 --> 18:35.872
in one of his e-mails
to Janet.

18:35.910 --> 18:37.548
Here.

18:37.580 --> 18:39.377
He lives in Morris Park.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.412
I'll call Marcus.

18:46.190 --> 18:47.509
Can I help you?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.448
I'm Detective Marcus Bell.

18:49.490 --> 18:50.855
I'm looking for Toby Dannon.

18:50.890 --> 18:53.290
I'm his father.
Is everything okay?

18:53.330 --> 18:55.798
I'd just like to ask him
a few questions.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.923
Why? Did something happen?

18:57.970 --> 18:59.824
I think it's better
if I discuss it with Toby.

18:59.870 --> 19:00.632
Is he here?

19:00.670 --> 19:03.161
Well, he is, but
this is my house,

19:03.210 --> 19:04.905
and he's my son.
I think I have a right to know

19:04.940 --> 19:06.305
what you want
to talk to him about.

19:06.340 --> 19:07.898
I want to talk about the fact

19:07.940 --> 19:10.204
that his drug dealer
was murdered a few days ago.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.810
Can I come in now?

19:12.850 --> 19:16.570
I-I mean, uh, yeah, yeah,
it's-it's true.

19:16.620 --> 19:18.144
I was buying oxy
off of-of Janet.

19:20.490 --> 19:22.378
Toby, what the hell
were you thinking?

19:22.420 --> 19:23.956
Did you ever drive

19:23.990 --> 19:25.651
a truck onto one of my sites

19:25.690 --> 19:27.829
when you were on that stuff?

19:27.860 --> 19:29.293
Did you ever run a saw?

19:29.330 --> 19:31.560
Due respect, Mr. Dannon,
I have a few questions

19:31.600 --> 19:32.897
of my own I'd like to ask.

19:32.930 --> 19:35.239
Maybe you could give
us a minute.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.728
Listen, I'm not here for some
kind of midnight raid, okay?

19:39.770 --> 19:41.909
Nobody's getting dragged
down to the station.

19:41.940 --> 19:43.942
I just want to talk to you
about what happened to Janet.

19:43.980 --> 19:47.768
(stammers)
What do you-what do you mean?

19:47.820 --> 19:49.515
What-what happened?

19:49.550 --> 19:50.847
She was strangled.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.484
Three days ago.

19:53.520 --> 19:56.409
A couple of my colleagues
were at Janet's apartment today.

19:56.460 --> 19:57.927
They found an e-mail she sent,

19:57.960 --> 19:59.484
warning you to be careful

19:59.530 --> 20:00.952
because someone named Dylan
had seen you leaving

20:01.000 --> 20:02.353
her parking lot.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.892
That name ring a bell?

20:05.930 --> 20:08.398
Yeah, uh, Dylan is Dylan Hess.

20:10.840 --> 20:13.377
He was a boyfriend of hers,
on and off.

20:13.410 --> 20:15.503
He was a jerk.

20:15.540 --> 20:18.247
She seemed to think
he might try to hurt you.

20:18.280 --> 20:20.009
That because you and Janet
had something on the side,

20:20.050 --> 20:21.347
he found out, got jealous?

20:21.380 --> 20:24.019
No, no, nothing like that.

20:24.050 --> 20:26.439
Then what was the problem?

20:26.490 --> 20:28.481
Janet told me that

20:28.520 --> 20:31.023
Dylan didn't want her...

20:31.060 --> 20:33.858
around any drugs.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.460
Using, selling, any of it.

20:36.500 --> 20:40.027
um, me and-and the people
she sold it to,

20:40.070 --> 20:41.958
we were a part of the problem.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.831
And Janet,

20:43.870 --> 20:46.862
she got tired
of hearing it, so...

20:46.910 --> 20:49.378
that's one of the reasons
why they broke up.

20:49.410 --> 20:51.048
They weren't together anymore?

20:51.080 --> 20:54.413
A-About a month ago
they got in a fight.

20:54.450 --> 20:57.339
Like a, like a fight fight.

20:57.390 --> 21:00.018
Like h-he sent her
to the hospital.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.019
After that, they were done.

21:03.060 --> 21:04.687
You ever meet this guy?

21:06.990 --> 21:09.550
You think Dylan could
have killed Janet?

21:09.600 --> 21:12.296
Honestly, I don't know
who else it could have been.

21:20.340 --> 21:21.477
You said
you had something for me?

21:21.510 --> 21:23.341
What is this really about?

21:23.380 --> 21:24.745
What's what really about?

21:24.780 --> 21:26.077
You said you wanted my help

21:26.110 --> 21:27.316
finding Hector Mendoza.

21:27.350 --> 21:28.908
I do.

21:28.950 --> 21:30.076
The information
you gave me

21:30.120 --> 21:31.815
was mostly about him.

21:31.850 --> 21:33.818
Mug shot, rap sheet,
list of known associates,

21:33.860 --> 21:36.784
but there was nothing in there
about the home invasions

21:36.820 --> 21:38.082
you said he's been
pulling off.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.586
So?

21:39.630 --> 21:41.097
There hasn't been
a home invasion robbery

21:41.130 --> 21:42.757
in Coney Island since October,

21:42.800 --> 21:44.825
and that guy was
caught by you.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.428
Hector Mendoza has a record.

21:46.470 --> 21:48.995
He's in a gang,
but as far as I can tell,

21:49.040 --> 21:50.962
he's not wanted
by anyone for anything.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.331
So, I'll ask you again.
What is this really about?

21:54.710 --> 21:57.349
Figured I'd waste
a little of your time,

21:57.380 --> 21:59.109
but hey, you're smarter
than I thought.

21:59.150 --> 22:00.811
Congrats.

22:00.850 --> 22:02.511
You're lying.

22:03.820 --> 22:05.048
About what?

22:05.090 --> 22:07.081
All of it.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.417
You want this guy found.

22:08.460 --> 22:09.859
You just don't want
to tell me why.

22:09.890 --> 22:11.721
Good luck with the bomb thing.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.591
If you need a hand
in Coney Island

22:13.630 --> 22:15.928
you know who to call.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.437
I see you got Marcus' text.

22:23.470 --> 22:24.937
"Dylan Hess
en route to precinct."

22:24.970 --> 22:26.369
That's him in there.

22:26.410 --> 22:27.729
Marcus is letting him
stew for a moment,

22:27.780 --> 22:29.008
and then we'll begin.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.600
I want to talk to you
about Detective Cortes.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.140
First, I'd like you to know,

22:33.180 --> 22:34.772
that you are completely alibied.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.572
What?
I overheard

22:36.620 --> 22:39.589
a familiar name a short
while ago-- Hector Mendoza.

22:39.620 --> 22:41.451
At approximately 3:00 am.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.788
he was viciously assaulted
in Gravesend.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.479
He was ambushed
and then beaten

22:45.530 --> 22:47.418
by someone wearing a pair
of weighted knuckle gloves.

22:47.460 --> 22:49.428
According to a witness

22:49.460 --> 22:50.768
one block away, it was someone

22:50.800 --> 22:53.769
with long,
dark hair and breasts.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.097
You have both.

22:55.140 --> 22:56.664
Or all three,
depending on your maths.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.964
Wait, are you
saying that Cortes

22:59.010 --> 23:00.409
was trying to frame me?

23:00.440 --> 23:02.738
She had you ask around
about Mr. Mendoza,

23:02.780 --> 23:05.874
and then someone-- a woman--
VICIously assaulted him.

23:05.910 --> 23:07.411
You think that's coincidence?

23:07.450 --> 23:09.816
Anyway, as I said,
you have an alibi.

23:09.850 --> 23:11.579
The cameras outside
the brownstone

23:11.620 --> 23:14.919
have you arriving at 11:00 pm.
and you did not leave until...

23:14.960 --> 23:16.154
47 minutes ago.

23:16.190 --> 23:17.828
Whatever your enemy
is up to,

23:17.860 --> 23:20.556
it will not work.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.852
You guys ready?

23:24.070 --> 23:26.061
I didn't kill Janet, okay?

23:26.100 --> 23:27.567
I would never do
something like that.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.194
So, you'll break her nose,
put her in the ER,

23:30.240 --> 23:31.502
but you draw the
line at murder?

23:31.540 --> 23:32.700
That's not what happened.

23:32.740 --> 23:34.139
We have her hospital records.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.000
Yes, I hit her. Once.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.871
Okay?
But it was self-defense.

23:37.910 --> 23:39.104
You want to see
my hospital records?

23:39.150 --> 23:40.947
She slammed my hand
in the door.

23:40.980 --> 23:43.847
Are you under the impression
that doesn't go towards motive?

23:43.890 --> 23:45.209
We had a fight, okay?

23:45.250 --> 23:47.081
And I'm sure
for most couples

23:47.120 --> 23:49.680
it means hugging
and crying and whatever,

23:49.720 --> 23:51.085
but Janet was a rowdy girl.

23:51.130 --> 23:54.099
You know, when she got angry,
she got physical.

23:54.130 --> 23:55.927
You're the ex-boyfriend
with no alibi,

23:55.960 --> 23:57.928
with a history of violence
towards the victim.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.494
x Wait, what are you talking
about ex-boyfriend?

24:00.670 --> 24:01.637
BELL:
We heard you and Janet

24:01.670 --> 24:03.228
broke up after the fight.

24:03.270 --> 24:05.830
Yeah, for like three days,
and then she forgave me

24:05.870 --> 24:07.838
like she always did,
and we got back together.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.030
Look, you can see.

24:10.080 --> 24:12.105
These were taken last week.

24:12.150 --> 24:14.141
Look.

24:20.050 --> 24:21.779
HOLMES:
Well, it certainly proves

24:21.820 --> 24:23.185
you were spending a lot of time

24:23.220 --> 24:24.881
with Ms. Heffernan in the days
before she disappeared.

24:24.930 --> 24:27.182
What do I have to do to prove it
to you that I didn't do this?

24:27.230 --> 24:28.549
We have reason to believe

24:28.600 --> 24:30.249
Janet scratched her attacker

24:30.300 --> 24:31.927
before she died,
would you mind if we...

24:34.700 --> 24:36.634
There, look.

24:36.670 --> 24:37.705
See?

24:37.740 --> 24:39.105
Not one scratch.

24:39.140 --> 24:40.505
What, you want to see the rest?

24:40.540 --> 24:41.871
I got nothing to hide.

24:41.910 --> 24:43.707
Hey, where are you going
with my phone, man?

24:48.620 --> 24:50.588
Did he prove beyond
all reasonable doubt

24:50.620 --> 24:52.042
that Janet Heffernan's
last desperate act

24:52.090 --> 24:53.751
was not clawing
at his private parts?

24:53.790 --> 24:55.815
Let's just say he's not
looking like our guy.

24:55.860 --> 24:57.157
What did you see
in that phone?

24:57.190 --> 24:58.953
Oh, it's what I didn't see.

24:58.990 --> 25:01.595
Yesterday, when we visited
Janet Heffernan's apartment,

25:01.630 --> 25:03.564
there was a coaxial jack
for cable

25:03.600 --> 25:05.124
above the counter
in her kitchen.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.523
Three weeks ago, however,

25:06.570 --> 25:07.730
when that photograph
was taken...

25:10.070 --> 25:13.164
No jack.

25:13.210 --> 25:14.905
So, she got cable, so what?

25:14.940 --> 25:16.703
So she doesn't own
a teleVI5ion.

25:16.740 --> 25:19.300
Unless you think the building
management insisted on the jack,

25:19.350 --> 25:20.669
consider the placement.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.869
Bad spot for a TV.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.740
Good spot for a camera.

25:26.220 --> 25:28.256
It's a spy cam.

25:28.290 --> 25:29.848
I'm not familiar
with this particular model,

25:29.890 --> 25:32.051
but it would serve the purposes
of your average voyeur.

25:32.090 --> 25:35.059
You really think a cable
plug is gonna show up

25:35.100 --> 25:37.728
out of thin air and she's not
gonna notice it?

25:37.770 --> 25:40.739
How many outlets, plugs and
jacks are there in your kitchen?

25:49.810 --> 25:52.677
We really are living
in a golden age

25:52.710 --> 25:54.246
for perverts.

25:57.650 --> 26:00.813
Whoever planted this lacked
the technical expertise

26:00.860 --> 26:02.816
to broadcast the feed,
so everything is stored

26:02.860 --> 26:06.023
on this drive,
which means they would

26:06.060 --> 26:09.120
have had to repeatedly break in
to access the footage.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.725
Here.

26:15.170 --> 26:17.058
(sighs)

26:20.240 --> 26:22.105
Hello.

26:22.140 --> 26:24.677
BELL: That's the guy you sent me
to talk to last night.

26:24.710 --> 26:27.349
That's Toby Dannon.

26:27.380 --> 26:30.144
How'd you feel about another
trip to Morris Park, then?

26:37.060 --> 26:38.652
Toby's not here-- he's at work.

26:38.690 --> 26:41.397
Well, can you tell us
when you expect him back?

26:41.430 --> 26:43.318
What is this?

26:43.360 --> 26:44.361
I need to speak

26:44.400 --> 26:46.322
to your son again, Mr. Dannon.

26:46.370 --> 26:47.632
Is this about
the woman you were

26:47.670 --> 26:49.934
asking about yesterday,
the drug dealer?

26:49.970 --> 26:52.063
Janet Heffernan,
the murder victim.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.032
Yeah, well,
Toby's shift just started.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.332
He won't be back for hours.

26:56.380 --> 26:57.904
You think Toby killed her,
don't you?

26:59.210 --> 27:01.178
We didn't say that.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.369
Are you worried he might have?

27:02.420 --> 27:03.910
Of course, she isn't.

27:03.950 --> 27:05.417
Toby's a good kid,

27:05.450 --> 27:06.986
just a little... different.

27:07.020 --> 27:08.681
How so?

27:08.720 --> 27:09.857
We had a tough time

27:09.890 --> 27:11.881
when he was in school,
but we got him help.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.125
His therapist said
he's doing much better...

27:14.160 --> 27:15.422
Beverly, I don't think we need
to say anything else.

27:15.460 --> 27:16.893
We're just here
to talk to your son

27:16.930 --> 27:18.022
and take_ a look
around his room.

27:18.070 --> 27:20.368
Well, this is my house.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.129
I don't consent to your search.

27:22.170 --> 27:23.706
I don't give you permission.

27:23.740 --> 27:26.868
All due respect, Mr. Dannon,
this warrant means

27:26.910 --> 27:28.138
we don't need your permission.

27:32.180 --> 27:33.204
Hey, could you not
touch that, please?

27:33.250 --> 27:34.911
It belonged to my father.

27:34.950 --> 27:37.009
I can't stop you from observing,
Mr. Dannon,

27:37.050 --> 27:38.847
but, please, don't interfere.

27:38.890 --> 27:41.688
We have a job to do.

27:41.720 --> 27:42.812
Toby always lived at home?

27:42.860 --> 27:44.225
Yes.

27:44.260 --> 27:45.852
Half the kids he went
to high school with

27:45.890 --> 27:47.289
still live with their folks.

27:47.330 --> 27:48.319
It's the economy.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.998
Yeah...

27:50.030 --> 27:52.464
And he has a job at your
construction company, correct?

27:52.500 --> 27:53.865
Yeah, he's saving money.

27:53.900 --> 27:54.935
It's smart.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.274
You know about this?

28:06.910 --> 28:09.777
Wonder what was in here
before I showed up last night.

28:10.850 --> 28:12.886
When's trash day?

28:12.920 --> 28:14.217
Tuesday.

28:14.260 --> 28:15.909
Okay.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.416
I'm gonna go have
a look in the cans.

28:17.460 --> 28:18.950
Mm-hmm.

28:31.810 --> 28:33.232
Toby got many friends?

28:33.270 --> 28:35.135
What the hell kind
of a question is that?

28:36.380 --> 28:37.404
I don't know,

28:37.440 --> 28:38.475
most of the pictures here

28:38.510 --> 28:39.977
are of the three of you.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.012
Said he was "different."

28:46.890 --> 28:49.154
Look, Toby's not
some kind of a loner creep.

28:51.560 --> 28:55.894
No matter how badly you
want to paint him as one.

29:09.980 --> 29:11.106
You were saying?

29:15.950 --> 29:17.884
WATSON :
Before.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.115
After.

29:20.150 --> 29:21.378
What is this?

29:21.420 --> 29:22.887
You found Hector Mendoza?

29:22.920 --> 29:25.081
No, you found Hector Mendoza
last night.

29:25.130 --> 29:28.429
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:28.460 --> 29:30.928
I went to talk to him this
morning, only he can't talk.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.790
They had to wire
his jaw shut.

29:32.830 --> 29:35.139
When I showed him your picture
he didn't recognize you,

29:35.170 --> 29:36.831
but who knows?

29:36.870 --> 29:39.430
Maybe that's just
the concussion?

29:39.470 --> 29:40.539
You did this to him.

29:40.570 --> 29:41.832
I want to know why.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.439
Come with me.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.277
There's something
I want to show you.

29:46.310 --> 29:47.914
Is it a pair
of SAP gloves?

29:47.950 --> 29:48.939
Just come.

29:51.850 --> 29:54.080
Her name's Nyoka Carver.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.418
That's her mom
trying to feed her.

29:56.460 --> 29:57.927
Why are you showing me this?

29:57.960 --> 29:59.257
This was Nyoka

29:59.290 --> 30:00.996
18 months ago.

30:01.030 --> 30:03.590
She was on her _school's
var5ity team Since eighth grade.

30:03.630 --> 30:04.961
In between seasons,

30:05.000 --> 30:06.160
she liked to play
against the boys

30:06.200 --> 30:08.964
in the pickup games
at Kaiser Park.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.331
When he wasn't dealing drugs

30:10.370 --> 30:11.598
or running with his gang,

30:11.640 --> 30:13.301
Hector Mendoza liked
to play there, too.

30:13.340 --> 30:15.479
A little over a year ago,

30:15.510 --> 30:17.068
she embarrassed him
on the court.

30:17.110 --> 30:19.977
I mean, just... humiliated.

30:20.010 --> 30:21.113
He went to his car.

30:21.150 --> 30:23.948
He came back with his gun,
and he pistol whipped her.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.242
He didn't kill her,
but he might as well have.

30:26.290 --> 30:28.884
She has irreversible
brain damage.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.285
I ran his name yesterday.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.129
I didn't see anything
about that in the system.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.957
Of course, you didn't.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.456
The kids that were there
were too afraid

30:35.500 --> 30:36.956
to give Hector up.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.069
They knew if they did,

30:38.100 --> 30:39.089
they'd get the same
from his crew.

30:39.130 --> 30:42.861
End of the day,
no one saw a thing.

30:42.900 --> 30:43.969
How did you find out about it?

30:44.010 --> 30:45.329
Sources.

30:45.370 --> 30:47.634
Couple weeks later,
Hector went after a member

30:47.670 --> 30:50.036
of a rival gang,
the 86 Street Kings.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.342
Shot him in the stomach.

30:51.380 --> 30:53.974
The guy lived,
but Hector went to the top

30:54.020 --> 30:54.975
of the Kings' hit list,

30:55.020 --> 30:56.112
so he went into hiding.

30:56.150 --> 30:59.119
I wasn't lying when I came
to see you the other day.

30:59.150 --> 31:02.017
I did everything
I could to find Hector.

31:02.060 --> 31:03.880
You were my last hope.

31:03.930 --> 31:06.956
And then, last night

31:06.990 --> 31:08.526
out of nowhere,
I found out

31:08.560 --> 31:11.267
that he was crashing
at a friend's in Gravesend.

31:11.300 --> 31:13.359
Then you gave him what
you thought he deserved.

31:13.400 --> 31:14.958
You think he deserved less?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.093
You've done this before.

31:17.140 --> 31:20.598
Back when I looked into you,
I realized how good you are.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.107
I could use help.

31:22.140 --> 31:24.005
What makes you think
I would help you?

31:24.050 --> 31:25.449
I know about you
and your partner,

31:25.480 --> 31:27.004
how you work.

31:27.050 --> 31:28.574
I read the transcript
from that disciplinary hearing.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.417
We don't hurt people.

31:30.450 --> 31:32.088
You don't hurt people,

31:32.120 --> 31:34.259
but your partner does sometimes.

31:34.290 --> 31:35.279
He gets it.

31:35.320 --> 31:37.117
I think you get it, too.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.378
Otherwise,
you wouldn't be with him.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.091
Think about it.

31:41.130 --> 31:43.098
It's all I'm asking.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.934
Still no word on Toby Dannon?

31:49.970 --> 31:52.063
Uniformed officers visited
all three construction sites

31:52.110 --> 31:54.032
where he could
have been working.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.308
He seems to have
taken a powder.

31:55.340 --> 31:57.137
Think his parents
tipped him off?

31:57.180 --> 31:59.000
Wouldn't surprise me
if they were packing his bags

31:59.050 --> 32:00.972
for Rio as we speak.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.443
In the meantime,
Finest Message has been issued.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.039
A lot of oxy.

32:07.250 --> 32:08.683
Toby must have had
a serious habit

32:08.720 --> 32:10.187
if he was taking
this much every week.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.357
Actually, I think you're looking

32:11.390 --> 32:13.051
at every pill he ever bought

32:13.090 --> 32:14.057
from Janet Heffernan.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.124
I don't think he used the drug.

32:15.160 --> 32:16.718
Ithink he just liked buying it.

32:16.760 --> 32:17.727
That makes sense.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.398
He was obsessed with her.

32:19.430 --> 32:21.569
Her job gave him an excuse
to be around her.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.329
So, how'd it go
with your stalker?

32:23.370 --> 32:26.134
Did you make it clear
that the frame-up wouldn't work?

32:26.170 --> 32:29.105
She wasn't framing me.

32:29.140 --> 32:30.334
(phone chirps)
Then what was she doing?

32:30.380 --> 32:32.109
It's complicated.

32:32.150 --> 32:34.072
Well, it appears Toby Dannon

32:34.120 --> 32:35.109
hasn't fled the country,
after all.

32:35.150 --> 32:37.209
He's at the 11th.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.718
BELL: The idea isn't for you
to admire your work, Toby,

32:39.750 --> 32:41.251
you're supposed
to answer for it.

32:41.290 --> 32:42.279
I don't know what you
want me to say.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.719
WATSON:
We want you

32:43.760 --> 32:45.625
to tell the truth
about Janet Heffernan

32:45.660 --> 32:47.127
and Omar Velez.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.597
VVho?

32:49.630 --> 32:51.723
Did you not get his name
before you gutted him

32:51.770 --> 32:53.397
and turned him into a bomb?

32:53.430 --> 32:57.093
I-I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.529
I mean, I-I-I don't understand
any of this.

32:59.570 --> 33:02.004
You were obsessed
with Janet Heffernan.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.099
That's obvious.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.345
All right, we also know
you were familiar with the site

33:06.380 --> 33:08.143
of Omar Velez's murder--

33:08.180 --> 33:09.215
Idlewild Park.

33:09.250 --> 33:11.639
Your dad's crew helped build
the visitor center there

33:11.690 --> 33:14.181
last year, and since
you're in construction,

33:14.220 --> 33:17.155
you have access
to plastic explosives, so...

33:17.190 --> 33:18.259
what am I missing?

33:19.690 --> 33:21.658
There's the wound
on his right arm.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.793
You're attempting to conceal it,
but you're nursing an injury

33:23.830 --> 33:25.263
just below your elbow.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.661
Yeah, I, uh, I-I cut
myself at work.

33:31.540 --> 33:33.303
Or Janet scratched you
while she fought for her life.

33:33.340 --> 33:35.103
I would never hurt her.

33:35.140 --> 33:36.539
BELL:
Really? 'Cause it looks like

33:36.580 --> 33:38.400
you fantasized about killing
her 50 different ways.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.202
Uh, see,

33:40.250 --> 33:41.148
m-m-my therapist, uh,

33:41.180 --> 33:43.114
told me to-to write

33:43.150 --> 33:44.219
what I felt.

33:44.250 --> 33:45.342
You know,
just to-to get it all out.

33:45.390 --> 33:48.257
You drew pictures of Janet
getting her head cut off.

33:48.290 --> 33:49.587
Yeah, but I loved her.

33:49.620 --> 33:51.326
How is this love, Toby?

33:51.360 --> 33:53.385
I wanted her...

33:53.430 --> 33:55.523
all right,
but she-she didn't want me back.

33:55.560 --> 33:58.120
I would go to see her,

33:58.170 --> 34:00.593
and she would just brush me off.

34:00.630 --> 34:02.666
T-These journals,
they were just a way

34:02.700 --> 34:06.306
for me to, like,
work through that.

34:06.340 --> 34:08.479
They weren't, like,
plans or anything.

34:08.510 --> 34:11.240
Okay, no-nobody was supposed
to see those.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.339
It's a terrible invasion
of privacy,

34:13.380 --> 34:14.119
and you must feel very violated.

34:14.150 --> 34:16.414
It's a shame
that Janet's not here

34:16.450 --> 34:18.680
to commiserate with you.

34:18.720 --> 34:21.257
Someone choked her to death
Tuesday night.

34:21.290 --> 34:23.417
Wait, Tu-Tuesday?

34:23.460 --> 34:25.325
What time on Tuesday?

34:25.360 --> 34:27.453
BELL: Specifically, we were
hoping you could tell us.

34:27.490 --> 34:29.196
All we know
is she disappeared somewhere

34:29.230 --> 34:31.289
between the end of
roller derby practice at 7:00,

34:31.330 --> 34:32.297
and dinner
with a friend at 10:00.

34:32.330 --> 34:33.490
She didn't show up.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.339
Okay, well, Tuesday,

34:35.370 --> 34:37.793
I was riding the A train.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.468
All night.

34:40.510 --> 34:42.239
You know, the noise
of-of the tracks

34:42.280 --> 34:43.804
a-and the-the sway of the train

34:43.840 --> 34:46.377
is-is so peaceful.

34:46.410 --> 34:47.502
You don't believe me?

34:47.550 --> 34:50.371
Check-Check the, check
the surveillance footage, okay?

34:50.420 --> 34:51.409
I'll be on there.

34:53.220 --> 34:54.710
And what about the other guy?

34:54.760 --> 34:57.456
The-The one that you said
had the bomb in his stomach...

34:57.490 --> 34:58.559
when-when did he die?

34:58.590 --> 35:02.196
Yesterday, just after 5:00 a.m.

35:02.230 --> 35:05.290
H was in Queens all day.

35:05.330 --> 35:07.161
H was paving a parking lot.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.792
I mean, y-you guys can-can

35:08.840 --> 35:11.809
ask anyone
who I was working with,

35:11.840 --> 35:14.331
and they will tell you
that I was there.

35:17.310 --> 35:19.301
(sighs)
I'm sorry

35:19.350 --> 35:21.318
(laughing):
to disappoint you guys.

35:23.420 --> 35:25.411
But I am not your man.
(chuckles)

35:35.760 --> 35:37.899
WATSON: Spoiler alert:
he gets on the A train

35:37.930 --> 35:39.659
and stays there all night.

35:39.700 --> 35:41.565
Tech assist got
through the footage

35:41.600 --> 35:43.238
from the other stations.

35:43.270 --> 35:44.828
He wasn't lying.
He could not have killed

35:44.870 --> 35:46.531
Janet Heffernan...
or Omar Velez.

35:46.570 --> 35:47.935
You heard from Marcus.

35:47.970 --> 35:51.246
Yeah, he talked
to Toby's other co-workers.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.542
He confirmed
that Toby

35:52.580 --> 35:54.844
was working the morning
of Omar's death.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.212
He'll get time for possession,
and for putting

35:57.250 --> 35:58.717
a spy camera in Janet's
apartment,

35:58.750 --> 36:01.514
but when it comes
to murder indictments,

36:01.560 --> 36:03.209
we are oh for two.

36:04.430 --> 36:06.819
I have to confess,
I am very, very surprised.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.658
I mean, he put a hidden camera
in Janet's apartment,

36:09.700 --> 36:12.464
he wrote journals about her,
took pictures of her...

36:12.500 --> 36:13.694
anyone looking at
his deranged little scrapbooks

36:13.730 --> 36:14.890
would have sworn he did it.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.363
An interesting question
to consider, then,

36:17.400 --> 36:19.504
is who else might
have been looking at them?

36:22.710 --> 36:25.201
You think he was sharing it
with some other creep?

36:25.250 --> 36:27.377
Not exactly.

36:29.250 --> 36:30.717
You're pulling prints.

36:30.750 --> 36:32.388
Searching
Toby's apartment today,

36:32.420 --> 36:33.978
I was struck by the fact

36:34.020 --> 36:36.887
that he had two hiding places
for his deviant treasures.

36:36.920 --> 36:39.457
I couldn't help but wonder
if the migration of his stash

36:39.490 --> 36:40.457
from one to the other

36:40.490 --> 36:42.219
was born out of necessity,

36:42.260 --> 36:44.194
rather than paranoia.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.219
So, you think someone found

36:47.270 --> 36:49.693
what he was hiding,
so he moved it.

36:49.740 --> 36:51.958
All I know for certain,

36:52.010 --> 36:54.308
is that there are two unique
right thumbprints

36:54.340 --> 36:56.399
on this journal.

36:57.710 --> 37:00.008
Someone else knew
Toby Dannon was

37:00.050 --> 37:01.415
a danger
to Janet Heffernan.

37:02.850 --> 37:04.511
GREGSON:
Neil Dannon?

37:04.550 --> 37:06.745
You think the father's
behind this?

37:06.790 --> 37:08.883
We know how it sounds.

37:08.920 --> 37:10.956
It sounds strange.

37:10.990 --> 37:14.255
The last time I checked,
Toby was peeping and plotting

37:14.300 --> 37:16.894
against Janet Heffernan,
not his dad.

37:16.930 --> 37:19.262
That's quite right,
but the younger Dannon's

37:19.300 --> 37:22.269
obsession did not go unnoticed
by Dannon, the elder.

37:22.300 --> 37:23.938
You'll see, uh,

37:23.970 --> 37:25.039
there were
two different thumbprints

37:25.070 --> 37:26.833
on one of Toby's journals.

37:26.870 --> 37:28.906
One from the author,
and one which matched

37:28.940 --> 37:31.443
the right thumb pad
of former Air Force Officer

37:31.480 --> 37:32.845
Neil Dannon.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.848
So, Neil got a taste
of his son's crazy.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.849
That kind of thing
normally isn't contagious.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.689
Imagine for one
depressing moment,

37:39.720 --> 37:41.278
you are Toby Dannon's father.

37:41.320 --> 37:43.959
You have a son that many say
is troubled, disturbed.

37:43.990 --> 37:45.423
He is quick to violence.

37:45.460 --> 37:47.758
He'_s obsessive.
He is unfeeling,

37:47.790 --> 37:49.599
but no matter how
difficult he may be,

37:49.630 --> 37:50.858
he's still your son.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.527
You still feel the need
to protect him.

37:52.570 --> 37:55.437
One day, you discover
a series of journals.

37:55.470 --> 37:57.290
To your dismay,
they detail plans

37:57.340 --> 37:58.432
to hurt a woman
named Janet Heffernan.

37:58.470 --> 37:59.767
What do you do?

37:59.810 --> 38:02.438
Get him help, lots of it.

38:02.480 --> 38:03.538
WATSON:
He did get Toby help.

38:03.580 --> 38:04.979
It wasn't working.

38:05.010 --> 38:08.309
So he killed Janet Heffernan
before his son could.

38:08.350 --> 38:09.840
HOLMES: If he did,
he would have prevented

38:09.880 --> 38:11.313
his son from becoming
a murderer.

38:12.820 --> 38:13.980
BELL:
All the evidence we have

38:14.020 --> 38:16.580
that points to Toby,
points to the dad.

38:16.620 --> 38:18.588
They're both familiar
with Idlewild Park,

38:18.630 --> 38:20.985
they both have access to
commercial grade explosives...

38:21.030 --> 38:22.054
GREGSON:
There's a problem.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.556
Let's say you're right.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.420
Let's say he's covered
with scratches.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.722
We won't find his DNA
under Janet's fingernails.

38:27.770 --> 38:30.034
Her remains were destroyed.

38:30.070 --> 38:32.061
We have no proof.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.066
HOLMES:
That's right, Captain.

38:34.110 --> 38:36.101
And, now, I normally have
a voracious appetite for proof,

38:36.140 --> 38:38.301
but in this case,
I don't think we need any.

38:39.910 --> 38:42.640
You sure about this? 100%?

38:42.680 --> 38:44.580
I'm afraid so.

38:44.620 --> 38:47.111
We interviewed three
different guards at the MTA,

38:47.150 --> 38:50.551
and one of them admitted
that Toby paid him

38:50.590 --> 38:53.081
to switch Wednesday's A train
security footage

38:53.130 --> 38:54.495
with Tuesday's.

38:54.530 --> 38:55.827
BELL:
Your son tried to falsify

38:55.860 --> 38:58.055
an alibi
for Janet Heffernan's death.

38:58.100 --> 38:59.658
Now, as you can imagine,
that's not going to look

38:59.700 --> 39:01.065
very good at his trial.

39:01.100 --> 39:03.068
HOLMES: Nor will the fact
that one of his co-workers

39:03.100 --> 39:05.102
said he went missing at the time
Omar Velez was killed

39:05.140 --> 39:06.937
in Idlewild Park.

39:10.180 --> 39:12.102
Why are you telling us this?

39:12.150 --> 39:14.744
GREGSON:
Because we'd like your help.

39:14.780 --> 39:17.374
Right now,
Toby is being surveilled

39:17.420 --> 39:18.409
by one of our units.

39:18.450 --> 39:20.111
It's the standard procedure
when you're suspected

39:20.150 --> 39:21.856
of being a bomber.

39:21.890 --> 39:25.656
The tactical experts think
the safest way to arrest Toby

39:25.690 --> 39:26.657
for Ms. Heffernan's murder

39:26.690 --> 39:27.918
is at his home.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.427
His job site's too crowded.

39:29.460 --> 39:31.519
So, when he gets back
from work later,

39:31.570 --> 39:33.561
we'd like for you
to help us keep him calm,

39:33.600 --> 39:35.431
make sure everything
goes smoothly,

39:35.470 --> 39:36.767
so nobody else gets hurt.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.703
You want us to help you
put our son in prison.

39:42.110 --> 39:43.668
WATSON: You'll get
to say good-bye.

39:43.710 --> 39:45.439
Toby is looking
at three counts

39:45.480 --> 39:46.378
of first degree murder.

39:46.410 --> 39:49.072
He is never going
to get bail or parole.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.473
Today is it.

39:52.220 --> 39:55.519
Okay, we'll do
whatever you ask.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.686
No.

39:56.720 --> 39:58.779
No, we have to.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.422
No, Toby is innocent.

40:00.460 --> 40:03.452
Mr. Dannon, please
consider the evidence...

40:03.500 --> 40:05.889
No, you don't understand.

40:07.570 --> 40:08.730
I did this.

40:08.770 --> 40:09.737
I killed Janet.

40:09.770 --> 40:11.863
What?

40:11.910 --> 40:13.730
I never meant
for it to happen.

40:16.210 --> 40:18.974
I knew Toby liked Janet, I...

40:19.010 --> 40:20.170
found his journals,

40:20.210 --> 40:21.746
and I confronted him.

40:23.150 --> 40:24.947
I could tell that_
he wasn't gonna let it go.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.788
He couldn't.

40:27.820 --> 40:29.913
I went to Janet
and I asked her

40:29.960 --> 40:31.484
to stop talking to Toby,

40:31.530 --> 40:32.883
stop selling him drugs.

40:32.930 --> 40:35.455
I even offered her money
to move, to disappear.

40:37.660 --> 40:39.218
She wouldn't listen.

40:39.270 --> 40:42.592
We started arguing, and...

40:42.640 --> 40:44.608
the next thing I knew,
she came at me.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.665
I don't know.
We were fighting.

40:47.840 --> 40:50.138
It was self-defense, I swear.

40:50.180 --> 40:53.149
And the murder of Omar Velez?

40:53.180 --> 40:55.648
And the bomb which killed
Nicole Slater at the morgue?

40:57.250 --> 40:59.616
That was self-defense, too,
I suppose.

41:02.020 --> 41:03.214
Oh, God...

41:08.230 --> 41:09.891
(sobbing):
Oh, God...

41:14.200 --> 41:15.838
You been out here long?

41:15.870 --> 41:17.531
I went to see
Nyoka Carver today.

41:17.570 --> 41:18.935
I sat with her

41:18.970 --> 41:20.164
for a very long time.

41:20.210 --> 41:21.165
I talked to her mother.

41:21.210 --> 41:22.768
About me?

41:22.810 --> 41:24.698
About Nyoka.

41:24.750 --> 41:27.173
Did you know she was bullied
in school because she was gay?

41:27.210 --> 41:28.711
No.

41:28.750 --> 41:31.548
The funny thing is,
she never let it get to her.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.842
Her attitude was
turn the other cheek.

41:33.890 --> 41:35.517
She even wrote_
an essay about it

41:35.560 --> 41:37.289
for a college application.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.858
Let me guess, you don't think
she would have wanted

41:40.890 --> 41:43.097
anyone going
after Hector Mendoza.

41:43.130 --> 41:45.621
I don't know what
she would have wanted,

41:45.670 --> 41:47.922
but I don't think you did
what you did for her.

41:47.970 --> 41:50.530
I think you did it for yourself.

41:50.570 --> 41:51.707
You needed to hurt him.

41:51.740 --> 41:53.230
He needed to be hurt.

41:53.270 --> 41:55.135
There's a difference.

41:55.180 --> 41:57.501
I've decided
I am gonna help you.

41:58.780 --> 42:00.600
By warning you,
don't do this again.

42:00.650 --> 42:02.572
Or what?

42:02.620 --> 42:03.917
Or I'll prove it was you.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.542
I read the report
on Hector's assault.

42:06.590 --> 42:07.716
You were careful.

42:07.750 --> 42:10.116
There's no evidence
that you did it.

42:10.160 --> 42:13.027
But next time...

42:13.060 --> 42:15.290
You've been doing this
four years, right?

42:15.330 --> 42:18.720
And before that you were
some kind of rehab expert,

42:18.770 --> 42:20.567
and before that
you were a doctor.

42:20.600 --> 42:23.569
Four years is nothing.

42:23.600 --> 42:26.262
You think you've seen things,
but you haven't.

42:26.310 --> 42:28.005
Stay the course

42:28.040 --> 42:29.735
this time, Joan.

42:29.780 --> 42:31.077
Stick this one out.

42:32.710 --> 42:35.315
Eventually, I'll see things
just like you.

42:35.350 --> 42:37.614
You and your partner,

42:37.650 --> 42:39.686
you're already
right on that edge.

42:39.720 --> 42:40.982
Who knows?

42:41.020 --> 42:43.159
Maybe I'll be the one
putting you away.

42:43.190 --> 42:44.589
Race you to the bottom.
