WEBVTT

02:10.875 --> 02:13.500
And now, in our third series
of discussions

02:13.500 --> 02:15.042
entitled Modern Marriage

02:15.042 --> 02:17.125
Mr. Harold Nicolson
and his wife

02:17.125 --> 02:19.750
the distinguished novelist
Vita Sackville-West

02:19.750 --> 02:21.375
share with us their thoughts

02:21.375 --> 02:24.000
on the foundation
of a modern marriage.

02:29.958 --> 02:32.458
I didn't sign
a marriage contract.

02:32.458 --> 02:33.958
I negotiated one.

02:33.958 --> 02:36.625
And I found a great deal
more flexibility

02:36.625 --> 02:38.667
than I was brought up
to expect.

02:38.667 --> 02:40.167
- Would you agree?
- I would.

02:40.167 --> 02:42.000
Marriage is less
a piece of furniture

02:42.000 --> 02:43.958
and more like a plant.

02:43.958 --> 02:46.500
A living organism
in need of constant nurture.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.083
It is not something we own
but something we grow.

02:49.083 --> 02:51.167
And in so doing,
we are offered the opportunity

02:51.167 --> 02:53.208
to nurture it in our own image.

02:53.208 --> 02:55.625
Yes, but it does seem

02:55.625 --> 02:59.917
that men tend
to regard themselves the plant

02:59.917 --> 03:01.792
and women, the soil.

03:01.792 --> 03:04.917
This is a poor state of affairs
for both sexes.

03:04.917 --> 03:07.167
I enjoy the qualities in myself

03:07.167 --> 03:09.458
that may be said
to be masculine.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.292
And so do I, darling.

03:11.333 --> 03:14.667
Nevertheless, I would argue
the most virile woman

03:14.667 --> 03:17.292
is infinitely more feminine
than the most feminine man.

03:17.292 --> 03:21.042
That kind of thinking
implies damaging absolutes.

03:21.042 --> 03:24.792
That there is something necessarily
passive about the feminine

03:24.792 --> 03:26.792
and therefore that it should
always be the woman

03:26.792 --> 03:29.708
who surrenders
her opportunities.

03:29.708 --> 03:32.417
But you do agree
that the joys of motherhood

03:32.417 --> 03:35.333
are sufficient compensation
for any such sacrifice?

03:37.167 --> 03:39.292
Emphatically not.

03:39.292 --> 03:42.000
Are you saying that your
success as a bestselling writer

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
thrills you more than
your duties as a mother?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.917
My professional success
satisfies a different stomach.

03:48.167 --> 03:51.167
Independence has no sex.

04:11.958 --> 04:13.667
Do you think
we scandalized the nation?

04:13.667 --> 04:15.667
With any luck, we did.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.208
Are you coming to Bloomsbury?

04:17.208 --> 04:20.166
I'm not sure I could bear
an evening of sullen handshakes

04:20.166 --> 04:23.083
and breathless philosophy.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.333
I think you'd find
you've got them quite wrong.

04:36.042 --> 04:37.958
Good luck with your mother.

04:42.542 --> 04:44.667
Aren't you sweet?

04:44.667 --> 04:46.208
I want some cake, mama.

04:46.208 --> 04:49.208
Boys, what do you say
to bonne maman?

04:49.208 --> 04:51.292
Oh, it's alright. Tuck in.

04:58.458 --> 05:01.042
I've been invited to a party
in Bloomsbury tonight.

05:01.042 --> 05:03.250
All the most exciting artists
will be there

05:03.250 --> 05:06.333
and all the writers
from the Hogarth Press.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.708
Oh, isn't it run
by those Woolfs?

05:08.708 --> 05:10.167
Yes. That's why
I'm so flattered.

05:10.167 --> 05:13.250
But they're socialists.
They are bohemians.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.667
This is a chance for me
to be accepted by serious minds.

05:16.667 --> 05:18.375
I hear she's mad.

05:18.375 --> 05:20.917
I wouldn't want people to believe
everything they hear about me.

05:20.917 --> 05:23.500
Well, of course, in your case,
everything they hear is true.

05:27.667 --> 05:30.333
Virginia
is a wickedly brilliant mind

05:30.333 --> 05:32.208
and I must know her.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.042
I hope you're not thinking
of running off with her as well?

05:36.042 --> 05:39.000
- No, maman. Of course not.
- If you do that again...

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
You've scolded me enough.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.792
I've said again and again
how much I regret what happened

05:44.792 --> 05:47.250
and that I only pretended to be
a man when I went to France

05:47.250 --> 05:49.417
with Violet
to get copy for my book.

05:49.417 --> 05:52.333
I'm sorry
if the gossip gave you pain.

05:52.333 --> 05:56.375
I thought I could try
to forget your behavior

05:56.375 --> 05:59.625
but you decided now
to tell the whole world.

05:59.625 --> 06:02.333
- S... so you've read it then?
- It's not a novel.

06:03.750 --> 06:08.250
It's a thinly disguised account
of your ludicrous affair.

06:08.250 --> 06:11.375
- It's already been printed.
- But not published.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.292
You will stop the publishing

06:15.292 --> 06:19.083
or I will stop all money
to you and Harold.

06:19.083 --> 06:21.583
And I shall take steps
to protect the boys

06:21.583 --> 06:23.458
from your influence.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.917
I'll ask my publisher not
to go ahead with the binding.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.958
What I want very much

06:38.958 --> 06:41.375
is to have a daughter
that I can be proud of

06:41.375 --> 06:43.667
and not
a promiscuous exhibitionist

06:43.667 --> 06:45.792
who brings only shame on me

06:45.792 --> 06:49.292
after all I have done
to be accepted by society.

06:51.083 --> 06:53.333
You really must promise
not to go.

08:10.208 --> 08:11.208
Ah!

08:14.250 --> 08:16.333
There you are, Vita.

08:16.333 --> 08:19.458
Um, I'm not sure
Nessa would be thrilled

08:19.458 --> 08:22.375
to find you
poking around in here.

08:22.375 --> 08:23.750
I couldn't resist.

08:26.875 --> 08:30.542
Ah, that's my wife's
new portrait of her sister.

08:30.542 --> 08:32.582
Oh, it's Virginia?

08:32.582 --> 08:34.667
Well, come back to the party

08:34.667 --> 08:37.957
and I'll introduce you
to the real thing if you like.

08:37.957 --> 08:40.957
She's not so tranquil
off the canvas

08:40.957 --> 08:42.917
I can promise you.

08:48.375 --> 08:52.500
Duncan, I found Vita
in Nessa's studio.

08:52.542 --> 08:56.458
- What shall we do with her?
- Forty lashes immediately.

08:56.458 --> 08:58.375
Much more taken
with Nessa's work

08:58.375 --> 09:00.250
than Duncan's,
weren't you, Vita?

09:00.250 --> 09:03.250
I didn't know you worked
with Mrs. Bell, Mr. Grant.

09:03.250 --> 09:06.167
Constantly. About half
the work in there is mine.

09:06.167 --> 09:09.208
They have the same way of seeing
the world, you see, Vita.

09:09.208 --> 09:13.000
Theirs is what Virginia calls
a left-handed marriage.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.083
And what would that make
your marriage to Nessa then?

09:16.083 --> 09:18.000
A crowded one.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.750
Nessa and I try to catch
the truth of a thing

09:20.750 --> 09:22.042
by... by stripping it back...

09:22.042 --> 09:23.667
- Vanessa?
- ...capturing its essence.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.500
Radical simplification.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.500
Mm, no, no, no,
you're boring poor Vita, Duncan.

10:46.917 --> 10:49.250
I heard you on the radio
this morning.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.417
I just read your latest novel.

10:57.750 --> 11:00.625
Why do you think your books sell
more than mine?

11:00.625 --> 11:03.208
Popularity was never
a sign of genius.

11:09.958 --> 11:11.875
Are you going to smoke that?

11:57.292 --> 11:59.250
Bodies, bodies, bodies.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.542
- How does it feel?
- What are you getting at?

12:05.542 --> 12:07.167
The present moment.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.583
What is it composed of?

12:12.583 --> 12:17.125
It is composed
of bodily sensations.

12:17.125 --> 12:21.208
The air wafts cold on the skin
under one's clothes.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.917
The touch of a hand
gives the sense

12:22.917 --> 12:25.500
that one is sinking through
the center of the earth.

12:26.708 --> 12:28.667
The moment becomes harder..

12:30.042 --> 12:32.792
...stained by the desire
to be loved..

12:34.250 --> 12:37.167
...to be held close
by another shape.

12:41.500 --> 12:45.042
Can you feel it
running molten up your spine

12:45.042 --> 12:46.667
and down your limbs?

12:48.042 --> 12:51.042
Can you see
what's inside this moment?

12:51.042 --> 12:52.500
Can you feel it?

12:57.708 --> 13:00.708
Yes, it is hardened.

13:03.292 --> 13:06.917
Stained by the desire
to be loved.

13:06.917 --> 13:08.667
There.

13:08.667 --> 13:10.375
Snap.

13:10.375 --> 13:13.167
The body takes us there
and brings us back.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.833
It's entirely necessary
and a constant distraction.

13:17.833 --> 13:20.583
If we don't live quietly
inside the moment..

13:22.917 --> 13:25.042
...what would be one's gain
in dying?

13:26.917 --> 13:29.250
No.

13:29.250 --> 13:32.375
Stay this moment.
No one ever says that enough.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.542
Good morning, neighbor.

14:11.542 --> 14:13.417
Morning, neighbor.

14:13.417 --> 14:16.875
And a very good morning... it is,
neighbor.

14:27.542 --> 14:29.750
How was Clive's?

14:29.750 --> 14:31.708
A revelation.

14:31.708 --> 14:33.750
Well, did you meet her?

14:33.750 --> 14:35.375
Yes.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.083
I adore her.

14:38.083 --> 14:39.750
And so will you.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.500
She was utterly silent

14:43.500 --> 14:45.833
until she wanted to say
something

14:45.833 --> 14:49.167
and then she said it
supremely well.

14:49.167 --> 14:51.667
I still don't know why you wanna
go slumming about in Bloomsbury.

14:51.667 --> 14:54.208
Don't be such a dreadful snob,
Harold.

14:54.208 --> 14:57.333
The lot of them feel
so downtrodden and earnest.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.958
I thought I might invite her
to join my little writers' club

14:59.958 --> 15:01.333
unless you disagree?

15:01.333 --> 15:03.292
- Strongly, darling.
- Marvelous.

15:03.292 --> 15:05.542
That will make it all the more
enjoyable to invite her.

15:07.750 --> 15:10.250
No, I hear nothing
but reports of her madness.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.667
Madness.

15:11.667 --> 15:14.125
What a convenient way
to explain away her genius.

15:14.125 --> 15:15.458
Genius.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.542
I'm not set against her,
darling.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.917
I just think she sounds like
rather hard work.

15:30.333 --> 15:32.667
That young man
is a congenital idiot.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.167
What little brain he had

15:34.167 --> 15:36.250
has been commandeered
by Dora Carrington.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.625
He forgot to grease the rollers
on the press.

15:38.625 --> 15:39.875
He can't remember where he put

15:39.875 --> 15:41.458
the woodcuts
for your new easels.

15:41.458 --> 15:44.417
I just hope they sell better
than the last round.

15:44.417 --> 15:46.417
Are you sure that headache
is from blocked sinuses?

15:46.417 --> 15:49.625
- Quite sure.
- You were up too late last night at Vanessa's.

15:49.625 --> 15:52.458
- You should get back to bed.
- Stop fussing, Leonard.

15:54.875 --> 15:57.750
There are
your wretched woodcuts.

15:57.750 --> 16:00.417
- I suppose he's told you?
- About the rollers?

16:00.417 --> 16:02.625
No. Damn the rollers!

16:02.625 --> 16:05.625
How can I think about rollers
when I've been... betrayed?

16:07.542 --> 16:09.750
- Dora's betrayed me.
- In what way?

16:09.750 --> 16:11.292
Well, she lied to me.

16:11.292 --> 16:12.500
She said
she wasn't seeing Lytton

16:12.500 --> 16:13.583
and she was seeing Lytton.

16:13.583 --> 16:14.708
She was honest.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.083
She told you
she wanted to see Lytton.

16:16.083 --> 16:17.292
And I told her
she wasn't to see Lytton.

16:17.292 --> 16:19.458
I see. You told her.

16:19.458 --> 16:21.292
I... I love her. She's mine.

16:21.292 --> 16:24.167
- Do you think that is love?
- Absolutely.

16:24.167 --> 16:26.958
And I'm in... in agony!

16:30.167 --> 16:32.000
Next time we advertise
for staff

16:32.000 --> 16:34.958
we'll stipulate
only eunuchs need apply.

16:34.958 --> 16:37.208
I often think romance is just

16:37.208 --> 16:40.250
not altogether knowing
the other person.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.542
It's the not knowing
that drives one mad.

16:52.917 --> 16:54.750
Dear Mrs. Woolf

16:54.750 --> 16:56.458
I admit
that when Clive invited me

16:56.458 --> 16:58.792
to your sister's party,
I came with every intention

16:58.792 --> 17:00.292
of meeting you.

17:00.292 --> 17:03.292
And what a curious creature
I found.

17:03.292 --> 17:07.666
You operate with such strength
and clarity.

17:07.666 --> 17:11.083
It is as if you were moving
above us somehow.

17:11.083 --> 17:15.166
How do you walk along that
raised ridge without falling?

17:15.166 --> 17:17.041
Now, if you'd allow me to ask

17:17.041 --> 17:20.375
Pen Committee are very anxious
for you to join our club.

17:20.375 --> 17:23.291
Will you be nice and let them
make you a member?

17:23.291 --> 17:25.416
For my sake,
if for no other reason.

17:31.042 --> 17:33.083
Bunch of landed aristocracy

17:33.083 --> 17:36.292
congratulating each other
on their mediocre scribblings.

17:36.292 --> 17:38.833
You can't tell me it would be
anything but pure torture for you.

17:38.833 --> 17:41.500
I might like to discuss
their mediocre scribblings.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.500
Huh!

17:42.500 --> 17:43.667
Vita seemed to sell

17:43.667 --> 17:45.500
more than mine in any case.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.917
Her last book outsold
D.H. Lawrence by a mile.

17:47.917 --> 17:49.250
I can't believe
you care about that.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.792
I don't. I just resent
your forbidding it.

17:52.917 --> 17:54.667
I'm not forbidding anything.

17:54.667 --> 17:56.083
But it would drain
and enrage you

17:56.083 --> 17:58.750
to have your brilliant mind
ogled by those leering toffs.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.042
Didn't she dress up as a man

18:06.042 --> 18:08.208
and run off
with Violet Trefusis?

18:08.208 --> 18:09.750
That must have been difficult
for Nicolson

18:09.750 --> 18:11.500
to live down
at the Foreign Office.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.000
You know I hate
this sort of gossip, Ginia.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.208
You know I don't take these

18:14.208 --> 18:16.417
aristocratic aberrations
seriously, Leonard.

18:16.417 --> 18:18.167
Then we are in agreement.

18:19.583 --> 18:22.417
"I see from the club papers
that it is a dining club

18:22.417 --> 18:26.125
"and my experience is that
I can't belong to dining clubs.

18:26.125 --> 18:27.500
I'm so sorry."

18:29.250 --> 18:30.917
Are you frustrated
because you wanted Mrs. Woolf

18:30.917 --> 18:32.333
to become a member
of your writers' club

18:32.333 --> 18:34.292
or are you just not used
to being refused?

18:36.500 --> 18:38.042
What did Violet have to say?

18:38.042 --> 18:40.208
She's going abroad.
She wants me to come with her.

18:42.125 --> 18:44.708
You're coming to Lausanne
on the 20th though, aren't you

18:44.708 --> 18:46.208
to play diplomat's wife
for five minutes?

18:46.208 --> 18:48.000
I shall be angry
if you don't come.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Yes, of course.

18:55.417 --> 18:58.083
She's absolutely
unscrupulous.

18:58.083 --> 18:59.833
If you see her at all,
I know your will becomes like

18:59.833 --> 19:02.083
a jellyfish addicted to cocaine.

19:02.083 --> 19:05.125
You know how grateful I am
that you came to rescue me.

19:05.125 --> 19:06.375
I'd have killed Violet

19:06.375 --> 19:08.000
if I'd stayed
with her an instant longer.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.250
It would have ruined us both,
but you would have been

19:09.250 --> 19:11.208
utterly cast out of society.

19:11.208 --> 19:12.458
You'd have lost the boys.

19:12.458 --> 19:15.542
I could have done nothing...
nothing to help you.

19:15.542 --> 19:19.167
I'll have nothing more
to do with her. Word of honor.

19:21.125 --> 19:25.542
I really am exhausted
with this sapphic pageant.

19:25.542 --> 19:26.667
I don't think
I could bear to be drawn

19:26.667 --> 19:28.208
into that vortex
of unhappiness again.

19:28.208 --> 19:32.167
- It nearly overwhelmed me.
- Hadji, I do love you.

19:35.917 --> 19:37.500
And I love you.

19:39.375 --> 19:41.917
But you do like to have
your cake and eat it, Vitti.

19:41.917 --> 19:43.792
And so many cakes.

19:43.792 --> 19:46.208
So many.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.583
Nothing would tempt me
to see her again.

19:55.958 --> 19:57.500
But if you do go off to France
with Violet again

19:57.500 --> 20:00.500
I shan't get into an aeroplane,
bring you back as I did before.

20:00.542 --> 20:03.042
I shall shock the nation
and elope to Kathmandu

20:03.042 --> 20:04.375
with Lord Curzon.

20:15.417 --> 20:19.458
I rely on your discretion,
Vitti.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.333
My own life depends on it.

20:38.042 --> 20:39.875
You won't join
my little writers' club

20:39.875 --> 20:43.875
so I shall have to enclose
my latest manuscript here.

20:43.875 --> 20:46.458
I would so love to know
what you think.

20:46.458 --> 20:49.250
If you like it,
my next is yours.

20:49.250 --> 20:52.292
A gift, if the Hogarth Press
would like it.

21:22.083 --> 21:24.417
Oh, dear.
We'll have to read it now.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.625
You admitted she does sell.

21:26.625 --> 21:28.458
You're not suggesting
we ask her to write for us?

21:28.458 --> 21:29.958
We could do with a bestseller.

21:29.958 --> 21:33.583
Don't forget we've got Tom Eliot
and Sigmund Freud to sell too.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.542
B... but maybe we should think
about it.

21:35.542 --> 21:38.333
But not her poetry, I beg you.
I won't print a word of that.

21:38.375 --> 21:39.458
Ha!

21:49.250 --> 21:52.792
I haven't lost the appetite
to know you better.

21:52.792 --> 21:54.583
So you must be very kind

21:54.583 --> 21:57.292
because I'm going
to be very brave and ask

21:57.292 --> 21:59.250
would you ever come
traveling with me?

22:22.083 --> 22:24.417
Does the proposal
seem attractive to you?

22:24.417 --> 22:25.833
I'm very flattered.

22:25.833 --> 22:28.042
I presume Mrs. Woolf knows
you've asked me?

22:28.042 --> 22:30.542
Of course, we always make
joint decisions

22:30.542 --> 22:32.375
about the writers we publish.

22:32.375 --> 22:33.625
I would ask her to join us

22:33.625 --> 22:37.208
but when there's a cross
on that door

22:37.208 --> 22:38.958
she's writing

22:38.958 --> 22:40.583
and everyone is forbidden
to disturb her.

22:40.583 --> 22:41.958
Even her husband?

22:43.875 --> 22:45.167
Even her husband.

22:46.667 --> 22:50.750
So she writes down here
amidst all this?

22:50.750 --> 22:52.208
Oh, Julian.

22:52.208 --> 22:54.542
A short, maybe a travel book,
will suit us very well.

22:54.542 --> 22:56.292
But we leave it to you.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.083
- Aunt Ginia, I bought us...
- Julian!

23:01.750 --> 23:04.708
Mrs. Nicolson is here,
Virginia.

23:04.708 --> 23:06.708
- Is she?
- How are you feeling?

23:08.458 --> 23:11.083
My head's a little better now
I've let some words out.

23:11.083 --> 23:12.583
Julian darling,
they look wonderful.

23:12.583 --> 23:14.667
Have you got something
for me to read?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.167
Well, if it's terribly written

23:18.167 --> 23:21.042
at least
the paper will be delicious.

23:21.042 --> 23:23.292
Mr. Woolf said
you weren't to be disturbed.

23:26.250 --> 23:28.250
I was battling to read
Mr. Joyce.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.083
Are you going to write for us?

23:34.083 --> 23:35.583
No one has ever yet
thrown down a glove

23:35.625 --> 23:37.458
I was not ready to pick up.

23:39.625 --> 23:41.958
I'm meeting Harold in Italy.

23:41.958 --> 23:44.500
On the peaks of mountains
and beside green lakes

23:44.500 --> 23:46.667
I shall write my story.

23:46.667 --> 23:48.792
I'll shut my ears
to the brawling rivers.

23:48.792 --> 23:51.208
I'll shut my nose
to the scent of the pines.

23:52.625 --> 23:56.583
I'll concentrate
on my story... for you.

24:00.833 --> 24:02.333
I must be going.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.375
Would you ever play a truant
to Bloomsbury

24:22.375 --> 24:24.500
and come traveling with me?

24:24.500 --> 24:26.792
You could look on it as copy.

24:26.792 --> 24:28.917
I believe you look
on everything

24:28.917 --> 24:30.875
on everyone, as copy.

24:32.583 --> 24:33.542
Uh..

24:34.625 --> 24:36.042
Goodbye, Mrs. Woolf.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.958
I feel as though I should like
to write you a long letter.

24:56.958 --> 24:59.167
An endless letter.

24:59.167 --> 25:01.375
Pages and pages.

25:03.208 --> 25:05.625
Ever since I left England,
I've been like a person

25:05.625 --> 25:08.042
in an advanced stage
of intoxication.

25:08.042 --> 25:10.708
Cocktails made not of gin
and vermouth

25:10.708 --> 25:13.917
but of thrill and misery

25:13.917 --> 25:16.625
adventure and homesickness.

25:21.042 --> 25:23.833
Tell me
who you've been seeing..

25:23.833 --> 25:25.750
...even if I've never heard
of them.

25:27.375 --> 25:30.500
I can get the sensation
of seeing you now and then..

25:33.125 --> 25:35.000
...but then I find you
going off.

25:37.750 --> 25:39.750
How little we know anyone.

25:42.250 --> 25:43.375
Only movements.

25:44.458 --> 25:45.708
Gestures.

25:47.917 --> 25:49.625
Nothing connected..

25:50.792 --> 25:51.917
...continuous..

25:54.292 --> 25:55.625
...profound.

26:01.167 --> 26:04.500
Don't you find all this intimate
philosophizing a bit vulgar?

26:04.500 --> 26:05.458
Tsk.

26:07.167 --> 26:09.542
I don't know why you care
what she thinks.

26:09.542 --> 26:12.292
They're lucky to get you.
Your books sell, hers don't.

26:13.750 --> 26:16.083
I want her to admire me.

26:16.083 --> 26:17.583
Oh, dear.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.458
I hope you're not about
to become a Gloomsbury.

26:24.958 --> 26:26.250
Ooh!

26:32.875 --> 26:36.208
I can't believe you!
This is unacceptable.

26:36.208 --> 26:38.833
- Please try to calm down.
- Try to calm down?

26:38.833 --> 26:41.208
How do you expect me to calm
down when you're on his bed?

26:44.958 --> 26:47.958
I can't. I can't bear it, Vita,
and I won't!

27:05.750 --> 27:07.625
Try to calm down?

27:11.750 --> 27:14.000
I don't think there's any use
in either of us

27:14.000 --> 27:15.917
playing wounded party,
Geoffrey.

27:15.917 --> 27:19.083
Well, you can't treat love
the way you treated mine.

27:19.083 --> 27:20.208
Truly, you can't.

27:20.208 --> 27:21.208
Nothing that's happened here

27:21.208 --> 27:22.917
hasn't been perfectly lovely.

27:22.917 --> 27:25.042
- We're both adults.
- Morning, Geoffrey.

27:27.750 --> 27:29.417
Well, there you have it.

27:31.792 --> 27:34.125
I don't know how I'm going
to summon the courage

27:34.125 --> 27:36.125
to see the Woolfs
without having heard

27:36.125 --> 27:37.792
a single word about my book.

27:37.833 --> 27:39.708
Do you think
they hated it very much?

27:39.708 --> 27:41.167
Perhaps they both want
to tell you

27:41.167 --> 27:43.583
how marvelous it was in person.

27:46.208 --> 27:48.458
You know what I think?

27:48.458 --> 27:50.750
It's self-conscious
and artificial.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.750
You've tried to write
like Mrs. Woolf, but you can't.

27:53.750 --> 27:56.000
And why you should want to,
I can't imagine.

28:01.792 --> 28:03.375
Dottie and Geoffrey.

28:03.375 --> 28:05.000
Trespassing on two marriages
at once.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.042
It isn't serious.

28:07.042 --> 28:09.333
Virginia and I will have
to console each other.

28:19.083 --> 28:22.292
I'd like to dedicate it to you,
if you don't mind.

28:24.667 --> 28:26.417
When we last met,
you said you thought

28:26.417 --> 28:28.917
I looked on everything,
everyone as copy.

28:28.917 --> 28:30.125
Did I?

28:30.125 --> 28:31.250
You couldn't have accused
poor Virginia

28:31.250 --> 28:32.708
of being that mercenary,
could you, Vita?

28:32.708 --> 28:34.958
She did.

28:34.958 --> 28:37.583
It gave me a great deal of pain.

28:37.625 --> 28:41.333
Do you ever mean what you say
or say what you mean?

28:41.333 --> 28:43.250
Or do you just enjoy
baffling the people

28:43.250 --> 28:45.167
who try to creep
a little nearer?

28:47.917 --> 28:50.417
You know very well
that I like you.

28:50.417 --> 28:52.042
A fabulous lot.

28:54.583 --> 28:55.792
Do I?

29:04.292 --> 29:05.542
Damn it.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.708
You must remember
that Virginia is vulnerable

29:12.708 --> 29:14.750
under all of that brilliance.

29:24.500 --> 29:25.625
I can't bear the thought

29:25.625 --> 29:27.542
of having caused you
any pain at all.

29:28.917 --> 29:31.583
Why have you such an art
of keeping so much of yourself

29:31.583 --> 29:33.417
up your sleeve?

29:33.417 --> 29:35.792
I suspect even after 20 years

29:35.792 --> 29:38.583
there'd still be something
to be unfolded.

29:38.583 --> 29:41.000
Some last layer not uncoiled.

29:42.500 --> 29:46.417
These snatched moments with you
are exasperating.

29:46.417 --> 29:49.125
Meet me so we may have another.

30:05.917 --> 30:09.083
I tried to find you at home,
but Leonard said you were here.

30:11.458 --> 30:14.667
I don't think I could ever care
for one single solitary thing

30:14.667 --> 30:18.958
with as much focus
as Leonard cares for you.

30:18.958 --> 30:23.458
I like things wild and vast
and complicated.

30:23.500 --> 30:26.667
- So I hear.
- I have something for you.

30:26.667 --> 30:29.417
A peace offering,
and don't try to resist

30:29.417 --> 30:31.417
because I've gone
to a lot of trouble.

30:33.458 --> 30:35.417
They're from Cairo.

30:35.417 --> 30:37.875
The blue-tinted spectacles
that inspired me

30:37.875 --> 30:40.000
to write "Seducers" about you.

30:41.583 --> 30:44.500
"Arthur Lomax found
that he no longer dared

30:44.500 --> 30:46.625
"to remove his spectacles.

30:46.625 --> 30:50.125
Realism was no longer for him."

30:50.125 --> 30:52.583
A fearless adventurer
who trades in passion

30:52.583 --> 30:55.292
pain and fantasy?

30:55.292 --> 30:58.083
Arthur Lomax is you, Vita.

30:58.083 --> 31:00.583
You just dedicated "Seducers"
to me, don't you see?

31:03.167 --> 31:05.875
- How unsettling.
- What?

31:05.875 --> 31:08.875
That you seem to understand
my work better than I do.

31:10.708 --> 31:12.875
When I read your work,
I don't know

31:12.875 --> 31:16.625
whether to be dejected
or encouraged.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.042
What do you mean?

31:18.042 --> 31:21.417
Dejected because I shall never
be able to write like that

31:21.417 --> 31:24.042
or encouraged
because somebody else can.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.208
- Do keep it up.
- What?

31:28.292 --> 31:31.333
The belief
that I achieve things.

31:32.375 --> 31:34.208
I have need of it.

31:34.208 --> 31:37.167
I am bewitched by your writing.

31:37.167 --> 31:39.083
It makes me afraid of you.

31:42.958 --> 31:44.458
It's all rhythm.

31:46.208 --> 31:49.333
Once you get that,
you can't use the wrong words.

31:49.333 --> 31:52.583
A sight, an emotion,
creates a wave in the mind

31:52.583 --> 31:55.417
long before you have the words
to describe it.

31:55.417 --> 31:57.875
When writing,
that is what you must recapture.

31:57.875 --> 32:03.125
That wave as it breaks
and tumbles in the mind.

32:03.125 --> 32:06.333
If you listen, it will make
the words to fit it.

32:11.750 --> 32:14.375
I must get back.

32:14.375 --> 32:16.000
I only stayed out this long

32:16.000 --> 32:17.708
because Leonard's reading
"Mrs. Dalloway"

32:17.708 --> 32:19.708
and I couldn't bear to be there.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.333
Goodness, Ginia.
Are you alright?

33:33.792 --> 33:34.917
Yes.

33:39.292 --> 33:41.250
Just tell me what you think.

33:45.958 --> 33:47.542
It's your best yet.

33:49.333 --> 33:50.708
Absolutely the best.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.292
You shouldn't be so fearful,
specially of what I think.

34:17.208 --> 34:18.833
"The state in which you live
at Charleston

34:18.833 --> 34:21.000
"is not modern but immoral.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.500
"And making a nonsense
of your marriage

34:22.500 --> 34:24.000
"by knitting your life together
with a man

34:24.000 --> 34:25.667
"who is not your husband.

34:25.667 --> 34:28.625
You know, of course,
Mr. Grant is a homosexual."

34:30.542 --> 34:33.250
What reason is there to think
I don't tell Clive everything?

34:33.250 --> 34:35.333
If anything, you share too much.

34:35.333 --> 34:36.958
I am completely indifferent
to anything

34:36.958 --> 34:39.583
the world may have to say about
me and my husband or my children.

34:39.583 --> 34:41.083
You seem indifferent.

34:41.083 --> 34:42.917
And I don't know
why you're laughing!

34:42.917 --> 34:45.250
I'm laughing at your rage,
Nessa.

34:46.542 --> 34:48.333
I knew you wouldn't like
"Mrs. Dalloway."

34:48.333 --> 34:50.292
- But I did like it.
- No, you didn't.

34:50.292 --> 34:52.208
- Just say you didn't like it.
- I won't.

34:52.208 --> 34:54.083
...on the house
if we don't disband...

34:54.083 --> 34:55.667
It's not half as debauched
down there

34:55.667 --> 34:57.292
as she seems to think.

34:57.292 --> 34:59.500
It might be fun if it were.

34:59.542 --> 35:02.083
You live exactly as you wish
at our house.

35:02.083 --> 35:04.333
The house
we have made yours too.

35:04.333 --> 35:05.875
How do you say such a thing?

35:05.875 --> 35:08.542
I live exactly as I wish, do I?

35:08.583 --> 35:11.083
Mm, positively angelic,
aren't you, Duncan?

35:11.083 --> 35:13.958
No one's forcing you
to live here.

35:13.958 --> 35:17.417
I thought it dazzling,
evasive and infuriating.

35:17.417 --> 35:19.000
Exactly like you.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.292
Well, there you are then.

35:23.667 --> 35:27.250
Nessa, I've always admired
your handling of life

35:27.250 --> 35:29.375
as if it were a thing
one can throw out.

35:31.250 --> 35:32.917
But I cannot think of any book

35:32.917 --> 35:35.625
I will read more often
than "The Common Reader."

35:35.625 --> 35:38.958
There are passages
I should like to know by heart.

35:38.958 --> 35:40.792
Of course,
you prefer "The Common Reader."

35:40.792 --> 35:42.292
- It's easy meat.
- Clive!

35:42.292 --> 35:44.083
- Well, it is.
- "Dalloway" is the thing.

35:44.083 --> 35:45.875
It is an organism.
It is alive.

35:45.875 --> 35:47.375
I wish
you could understand that.

35:47.375 --> 35:48.542
Why do you think that I don't?

35:48.542 --> 35:50.542
Because in your work,
you cling to technique.

35:50.542 --> 35:52.375
You don't understand
that once you've mastered it

35:52.375 --> 35:53.458
you should throw it up
in the air

35:53.458 --> 35:55.250
and let it smash
on the pavement.

35:55.250 --> 35:57.167
Right. Enough of all this.

35:57.167 --> 35:58.917
I need to show you something
in the studio.

35:58.917 --> 36:02.125
I need my harshest critics
throwing fire at the canvas.

36:02.125 --> 36:03.833
Oh, now come on.

36:03.833 --> 36:05.667
I'm staying at Knole
this weekend.

36:05.667 --> 36:08.583
Come with me and stay the night.

36:10.833 --> 36:12.625
No, no, impossible.

36:14.083 --> 36:17.208
I've only got torn clothes.
I'd have to eat behind a screen.

36:17.208 --> 36:19.750
You'd be ashamed of me.
You'd say things you'll regret.

36:19.750 --> 36:21.750
I don't think
I've ever wanted anything

36:21.750 --> 36:23.792
so much in my whole life.

36:26.458 --> 36:28.417
Would you be very kind to me?

36:29.833 --> 36:32.625
I'll pick you up on Saturday
at midday.

36:42.917 --> 36:44.875
- Virginia.
- Vita.

36:47.750 --> 36:50.458
- Hello, Leonard.
- Hello, Vita.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.542
- Drive safely.
- Don't worry, Leonard.

37:25.542 --> 37:27.292
We have the sandwiches
and the champagne ready, do we?

37:27.292 --> 37:29.083
- Yes.
- Very good.

37:29.083 --> 37:31.250
- I think she...
- What an exquisite hat.

37:31.250 --> 37:33.167
Very brave.

37:33.167 --> 37:36.542
Hello. You are very welcome.

37:36.542 --> 37:38.792
- Hello!
- Hello, darling.

37:38.792 --> 37:40.458
Hello, darling.

37:40.458 --> 37:42.708
This is Geoffrey Scott
and Dorothy Wellesley.

37:42.708 --> 37:45.292
I thought they'd round out
our little party.

37:45.292 --> 37:47.542
And this is Virginia Woolf.

37:49.542 --> 37:50.750
Lovely.

37:50.750 --> 37:53.000
How lovely of you all
to allow me to join you.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.375
Don't be silly.

37:54.375 --> 37:56.417
It's so sweet
that you were free.

38:00.542 --> 38:02.875
Well, don't just stand there.
Do come up.

38:25.333 --> 38:27.958
I'll take this to be ironed,
Mrs. Woolf.

39:07.375 --> 39:09.458
- Behave.
- It's very good.

39:10.667 --> 39:12.667
Really.

39:14.042 --> 39:16.958
What do you think
of this place, Mrs. Woolf?

39:16.958 --> 39:21.000
Vita tells me
you're damn hard to impress.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.042
I do so hope we all pass muster.

39:27.958 --> 39:32.542
The past is expressive here,
not dumb and forgotten.

39:32.542 --> 39:34.500
All the centuries seem lit up.

39:35.792 --> 39:36.792
All about the place

39:36.792 --> 39:39.250
a crowd of people
stand behind you

39:39.250 --> 39:40.750
not dead at all.

39:46.958 --> 39:48.625
How obscure you are.

39:51.625 --> 39:53.917
I think you've listened
a little too intently

39:53.917 --> 39:55.833
to what you've heard about me.

40:05.958 --> 40:08.208
Forgive me my faults, Virginia.

40:08.250 --> 40:10.167
They are silly surface things.

40:10.167 --> 40:11.292
I want to show you a place

40:11.292 --> 40:13.542
that really means
something to me.

40:13.542 --> 40:15.458
This is where I got married.

40:16.417 --> 40:18.375
It must feel very sacred.

40:20.708 --> 40:21.875
Marriage..

40:23.250 --> 40:26.625
...a ritual
performed on this spot

40:26.667 --> 40:29.250
permanently tore me apart
from this place.

40:31.042 --> 40:32.167
A play..

40:33.708 --> 40:37.167
...in which my part
was to be powerless

40:37.167 --> 40:40.750
to be passed
from one line of men to another.

40:40.750 --> 40:43.042
But you do love Harold?

40:43.042 --> 40:46.250
Of course, I do. Very much.

40:48.417 --> 40:51.875
But this house, it made me.

40:54.083 --> 40:56.583
Our separation
has been my greatest pain.

40:58.292 --> 41:01.708
It is where my soul is,
where my family are.

41:05.042 --> 41:08.000
I've been cheated
out of my home.

41:08.042 --> 41:11.208
I cannot have her
simply because I am a woman.

41:13.875 --> 41:17.708
It's as though for years
I've had an affair with a lover

41:17.708 --> 41:20.750
who never belonged to me
entirely.

41:20.750 --> 41:24.833
We've been forced apart
by stupid, ancient laws

41:24.833 --> 41:26.833
and I can only visit her.

41:37.750 --> 41:39.458
Are you alright, Virginia?

41:42.708 --> 41:44.208
Yes, I'm fine.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.917
Where is she?

41:55.917 --> 41:57.958
With the Mad Hatter, I suppose.

42:04.292 --> 42:06.333
Are you sure you're
feeling better, Virginia?

42:06.333 --> 42:07.667
I'm sure.

42:07.667 --> 42:09.667
Leonard will be furious
with me.

42:12.958 --> 42:15.042
Why did you bring
Dottie and Geoffrey?

42:30.000 --> 42:30.958
I..

43:11.500 --> 43:12.750
I can't.

43:15.167 --> 43:16.500
I've tried..

43:18.167 --> 43:19.333
...with Leonard..

43:21.208 --> 43:24.042
...but I... I... I..

43:50.042 --> 43:52.167
...manner had grown upon him

43:52.167 --> 43:54.542
and he took little parts
in the games.

43:54.542 --> 43:58.042
The children wearing the spoils
of their crackers

43:58.042 --> 44:00.083
danced and romped noisily.

44:00.083 --> 44:02.042
I wonder if I could render
one of your paintings

44:02.042 --> 44:03.417
into prose.

44:03.417 --> 44:05.708
You're hardly wanting
for inspiration.

44:05.708 --> 44:07.875
"Mrs. Dalloway"
has been so much admired.

44:09.375 --> 44:10.792
Are you pleased?

44:14.125 --> 44:15.708
Yes.

44:15.708 --> 44:18.333
I do write damned well
sometimes.

44:18.333 --> 44:20.833
Almost as well as your sister
paints, do you think?

44:20.833 --> 44:22.417
Never.

44:22.417 --> 44:24.333
But almost consistently better
than you do.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.708
What does Vita think?

44:33.625 --> 44:36.667
It doesn't matter.
It's not her mind I admire.

44:38.042 --> 44:40.042
What exactly happened at Knole?

44:43.583 --> 44:46.583
She lavishes a kind
of maternal protection on me

44:46.583 --> 44:49.833
but her friendship
is never untinged with desire.

44:52.083 --> 44:54.375
I wonder what exactly they do
with one another

44:54.375 --> 44:56.208
these sapphists.

44:56.208 --> 44:57.625
I really can't imagine.

44:57.625 --> 45:00.667
Nessa, of course, you can.
It must be marvelous.

45:00.667 --> 45:04.333
All those velvet curves
colliding.

45:04.333 --> 45:08.500
It does seem a shame to forfeit
actual penetration though.

45:08.500 --> 45:10.458
And what makes you think
they forfeit that?

45:14.417 --> 45:16.458
But do you like her, Virginia?

45:19.500 --> 45:22.833
I like her... maturity..

45:24.500 --> 45:26.167
...and her voluptuousness.

45:31.542 --> 45:33.500
Do you think
there's something wrong with me?

45:35.875 --> 45:37.583
Something disconnected?

45:44.417 --> 45:48.167
You are capable of so much love.

45:48.167 --> 45:50.958
And one has room
for many different shades of it.

45:53.625 --> 45:56.125
The truth is I worry
I'm not quite allowed

45:56.125 --> 45:59.333
to desire
in the same way as you.

45:59.333 --> 46:03.000
Sex isn't the most
important thing, you know.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.208
That's what people say
when it's easy for them.

46:14.042 --> 46:16.917
I was not intended to be
just a diplomat's wife.

46:16.917 --> 46:18.333
Well, that is what you are

46:18.333 --> 46:19.542
amongst a great
many other things

46:19.542 --> 46:21.333
which I've never objected to.

46:21.333 --> 46:22.917
But in Tehran, I will have

46:22.917 --> 46:24.583
more responsibilities
than ever before

46:24.583 --> 46:26.125
and I cannot be there
without a wife.

46:26.125 --> 46:29.083
Wife? You needn't administer
the word with such venom.

46:29.083 --> 46:32.417
- I deliver the word as fact.
- So I'm to play the role?

46:32.417 --> 46:33.583
What is a wife if not a role?

46:33.583 --> 46:35.417
And I'm to be thrown together
with people

46:35.417 --> 46:36.667
with whom
I have nothing in common

46:36.667 --> 46:38.917
except the place we happen
to find ourselves in?

46:38.917 --> 46:40.583
Yes, Tehran will be
much the same

46:40.583 --> 46:41.875
as any of my other postings.

46:41.875 --> 46:43.417
I can't bear it this time.

46:43.417 --> 46:45.208
Oh, I'm sorry
that diplomats and their wives

46:45.208 --> 46:46.875
don't talk about copulation

46:46.875 --> 46:49.667
with the same readiness
as your friends.

46:49.667 --> 46:50.833
And I'd feel
a great deal happier

46:50.833 --> 46:51.833
if you didn't see your friends
for a while.

46:51.833 --> 46:52.958
They make nothing but muddles.

46:52.958 --> 46:55.458
I'm not in any muddle
at the moment.

46:55.458 --> 46:57.042
- Geoffrey?
- That was never anything much.

46:57.042 --> 46:59.583
And he's quite happily gone back
to his tiresome wife.

46:59.583 --> 47:01.417
- Dorothy?
- I haven't seen her.

47:01.417 --> 47:03.583
Your maid. The French one.
Wh... what was she called?

47:03.583 --> 47:05.833
- Genoux. No.
- Violet?

47:05.833 --> 47:07.292
I don't even know where she is.

47:07.292 --> 47:08.417
And Virginia?

47:08.417 --> 47:10.000
That is not a muddle
and never can be.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.125
She's utterly unattainable.

47:11.125 --> 47:13.042
Which makes her
even more desirable.

47:15.042 --> 47:17.542
You know, I can't help but think
that this furious display

47:17.542 --> 47:20.042
has more to do with the timing
than the duties

47:20.042 --> 47:22.500
you've more than
happily performed for years.

47:22.500 --> 47:23.833
God forbid
I should wrench you away

47:23.833 --> 47:26.917
from your precious
genius invalid.

47:26.917 --> 47:28.750
Harold, please stop this.

47:28.750 --> 47:30.708
I don't question
your indulgences.

47:30.708 --> 47:32.875
I never play with fire, Vita,
because I don't have the luxury

47:32.875 --> 47:34.583
of flirting with scandal
as you do

47:34.583 --> 47:38.125
and I always, always choose
to be with you in the end.

47:38.125 --> 47:41.167
You never take risks?
Lord Curzon, Raymond...

47:41.167 --> 47:43.125
This arrangement works
because I allow it!

47:43.125 --> 47:45.583
Don't you dare believe that!

47:51.958 --> 47:53.625
I want you with me, Vita.

47:55.083 --> 47:57.375
We've been together
for only ten weeks this year.

48:05.708 --> 48:08.625
I find it all so meaningless
without you.

48:13.875 --> 48:15.417
It hurts me, Vita.

48:33.833 --> 48:36.750
- Well, for how long?
- Only four or five months.

48:36.750 --> 48:39.042
- Only?
- Think of seeing Persia.

48:39.042 --> 48:40.958
Yes.

48:40.958 --> 48:43.875
Do you think you might write
another travelogue for us, Vita?

48:43.875 --> 48:46.625
"Seducers in Ecuador" was such
a success for the press.

48:46.625 --> 48:48.333
I thought you'd never ask.

48:48.333 --> 48:51.583
It might breathe some life
into the stale domestic duties

48:51.583 --> 48:53.375
I'll have to perform for Harold.

48:53.375 --> 48:54.667
Of course,
I'll never see you again.

48:54.708 --> 48:56.208
Of course, you'll see me again.

48:56.208 --> 48:58.458
Do you think I'm going
to get kidnapped by brigands?

48:58.458 --> 48:59.667
No.

48:59.667 --> 49:01.417
I know
it doesn't make you envious.

49:01.417 --> 49:03.667
You prefer
your misty old Bloomsbury.

49:03.667 --> 49:06.917
But I do wish Leonard
would let me steal you away.

49:06.917 --> 49:09.083
Take you with me,
put you in the sun...

49:09.083 --> 49:11.708
And I wish you would stop
saying things like that.

49:11.708 --> 49:13.708
You know
it would never be possible.

49:15.208 --> 49:16.542
I shall miss you..

49:17.875 --> 49:19.833
...more than
you'll ever believe.

49:23.292 --> 49:25.167
She'd never say anything
as simple as that

49:25.167 --> 49:26.667
would she, Leonard?

49:26.667 --> 49:28.000
She clothes everything she says

49:28.042 --> 49:30.542
in such exquisite phrases,
things lose their meaning.

49:30.542 --> 49:32.375
Maybe you don't understand
the nature of the truth

49:32.375 --> 49:34.125
that Virginia unearths.

49:34.125 --> 49:35.875
She has the clearest mind
I've ever known.

49:35.875 --> 49:39.000
Always, always, always,
I try to say how I feel.

49:41.167 --> 49:43.458
I shall miss you dreadfully.

49:43.458 --> 49:45.250
Everything here
will seem dull and damp

49:45.250 --> 49:47.292
and if you don't believe that,
you're an ass.

49:48.458 --> 49:51.250
There.
Is that simple enough for you?

49:55.333 --> 49:57.292
I think we'd better be
saying goodbye, Vita.

50:12.833 --> 50:14.167
I shan't make you want me
anymore

50:14.167 --> 50:16.792
by giving myself away like this.

50:16.792 --> 50:19.125
You can't think me
that ruthless, can you?

50:47.583 --> 50:48.708
Ginia.

50:50.750 --> 50:52.750
Close the door.
It's bitter out there.

51:02.917 --> 51:05.750
The only way I can deal
with Egypt is alphabetically.

51:05.750 --> 51:07.875
Alabaster, Americans, Arabs

51:07.875 --> 51:09.625
bromides, buffaloes, beggars

51:09.625 --> 51:11.667
camels, crocodiles, colossi

51:11.667 --> 51:13.292
dust, dervishes, desert

51:13.292 --> 51:16.000
Egyptians, elation,
fellaheen, flies

51:16.000 --> 51:18.375
goats, granite,
hotels, hieroglyphics

51:18.375 --> 51:21.042
imshi, ignorance,
jibbahs, Kodaks

51:21.042 --> 51:23.292
Levantines, mummies,
mud, millionaires

51:23.292 --> 51:24.417
Nubia, obsidian

51:24.417 --> 51:26.625
pyramids, quarries,
ruins, sarcophagi

51:26.625 --> 51:29.458
Tutankhamun, utopia,
vultures, Virginia.

51:32.125 --> 51:33.833
I feel dissipated..

51:35.833 --> 51:37.125
...and aimless.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.083
Insipid.

51:41.167 --> 51:42.208
Restless.

51:43.208 --> 51:44.375
Virginia.

51:46.708 --> 51:49.125
I feel as if
a dark pool of sticky water

51:49.125 --> 51:50.708
were closing over me.

51:54.542 --> 51:56.542
It's that you're not here.

52:29.292 --> 52:34.583
Does anything ever actually
happen to Mrs. Dalloway?

52:34.583 --> 52:37.917
Not really.
She just gives the party.

52:37.917 --> 52:40.500
Golly, I'm hooked.

52:46.583 --> 52:48.542
More poetry from your Pharisee?

52:50.875 --> 52:52.833
He's in love with you,
of course.

52:54.750 --> 52:56.250
Is he still teaching you Arabic?

52:56.250 --> 52:58.208
No, this is from Virginia.

52:59.917 --> 53:02.583
You've finally caught your prey?

53:02.583 --> 53:05.417
- I suppose I have.
- Are you happy now?

53:17.625 --> 53:19.667
"'Mrs. Ramsay, ' Lily cried..

53:21.542 --> 53:23.250
"...but nothing happened.

53:23.250 --> 53:24.875
"'The anguish could reduce one

53:24.875 --> 53:26.917
to such a pitch of imbecility, '
she thought."

53:30.750 --> 53:33.083
It's good, Ginia.
It's always good.

53:49.458 --> 53:52.833
How very rude. I'd like
to see you give it a go.

54:08.250 --> 54:10.208
She just finished
"To The Lighthouse."

54:11.208 --> 54:12.208
It's remarkable.

54:12.208 --> 54:14.625
So confused in her letters.

54:14.625 --> 54:15.792
It's what I read.

54:15.792 --> 54:18.042
What is in Vita's past
is all in my future

54:18.042 --> 54:20.250
but in reading it,
in consuming it..

54:21.958 --> 54:23.542
...suddenly it's all over.

54:23.542 --> 54:25.417
She's no longer coasting
in Baluchistan.

54:25.417 --> 54:27.375
She's riding in a cab
in Baghdad.

54:27.375 --> 54:29.875
She's just asleep. She's dead.

54:29.875 --> 54:31.875
The present tense
has become meaningless.

54:31.875 --> 54:35.500
I heard she traveled
all the way from Luxor

54:35.500 --> 54:37.667
to Cairo
with the train on fire.

54:37.667 --> 54:40.375
Yes! Flames licking out
from under the carriage.

54:40.375 --> 54:42.125
All those smoldering diplomats.

54:42.125 --> 54:44.083
And all that chaos,
all that violence.

54:44.083 --> 54:45.583
- Do you know what she said?
- What?

54:45.583 --> 54:47.667
Simply that it gave her
a lingering regret

54:47.667 --> 54:48.792
for the Southeastern.

54:52.958 --> 54:54.083
Yeah.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.375
And what else
does she write of?

55:07.792 --> 55:10.375
She's crawled
through ramparts of snow

55:10.417 --> 55:11.875
been attacked by bandits

55:11.875 --> 55:14.417
seen hills
stained with copper sulfate

55:14.417 --> 55:16.375
mud towns at nightfall

55:16.375 --> 55:20.000
dead camels pecked by vultures,
dying men.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.208
And does she make you
want to write or to live?

55:26.625 --> 55:27.667
Both.

55:29.208 --> 55:31.292
But how to make sense of her,
Duncan?

55:33.000 --> 55:34.583
- What do you mean?
- All her fragments.

55:34.583 --> 55:37.708
She makes me feel as if language
is miserably insufficient.

55:39.667 --> 55:40.917
Broken.

55:42.250 --> 55:45.042
You must let the eye
lick it all up.

55:47.083 --> 55:49.417
All that deliciousness

55:49.417 --> 55:51.917
and then the brain
will settle itself down

55:51.917 --> 55:55.167
and watch things happening

55:55.167 --> 55:59.458
without troubling itself
to think.

55:59.458 --> 56:02.417
Yes, the eye licks it up,
but the brain can't.

56:02.417 --> 56:05.000
- The... the brain can't..
- What?

56:07.667 --> 56:09.583
What?

56:09.583 --> 56:11.750
- What?
- Live.

56:11.750 --> 56:13.792
- Virginia, are you alright?
- I'm so sorry.

56:13.792 --> 56:16.625
The eye and the brain..

56:21.417 --> 56:22.583
I'm so sorry.

56:22.583 --> 56:24.667
The... the eye and the brain..

56:26.083 --> 56:27.458
I can't..

56:32.417 --> 56:33.667
The eye and..

56:41.708 --> 56:42.875
The eye and..

56:49.583 --> 56:50.792
Ginia?

56:59.292 --> 57:00.542
I'm so sorry.

57:02.417 --> 57:05.042
Virginia. Wait!

57:05.042 --> 57:07.042
Just give her a moment.

57:54.792 --> 57:56.042
Virginia.

58:05.875 --> 58:07.667
I feel as though
my mind were driven

58:07.667 --> 58:10.125
to some remote corner
of my body.

58:11.125 --> 58:12.667
Don't worry, my darling.

58:12.667 --> 58:15.500
I'll bring you back
to the surface.

58:15.500 --> 58:17.500
Give her
all the usual sedatives.

58:19.458 --> 58:22.042
Absolute rest and quiet.

58:22.042 --> 58:24.833
We might just avoid a crisis.

58:28.625 --> 58:30.833
Is she writing?

58:30.833 --> 58:33.375
She's just finished a novel.

58:33.375 --> 58:35.500
I fear the writing is what
brings on the breakdowns.

58:37.042 --> 58:39.292
If you stop her writing,
she'll die.

58:39.292 --> 58:41.292
I sometimes feel
that women can't cope

58:41.292 --> 58:43.792
with too much gray matter.

58:43.792 --> 58:47.000
Well,
I'm not a doctor, of course

58:47.000 --> 58:50.958
but I do know a few men
who've had bouts of instability

58:50.958 --> 58:53.917
though I couldn't say whether
it was because of their genius.

58:53.917 --> 58:56.625
I do think the world is rather
short of brilliant minds

58:56.625 --> 58:58.542
and I'm happy to see it
in either sex.

58:59.833 --> 59:03.042
What fools would we be
to deny women a voice

59:03.083 --> 59:05.000
lest they laugh at us?

59:18.667 --> 59:20.708
The doctor has sent me to bed.

59:22.458 --> 59:24.500
Tried to forbid all writing.

59:27.500 --> 59:29.542
So this is my swansong.

59:33.125 --> 59:35.083
One thing has remained
a beacon..

59:37.125 --> 59:39.542
...these past six weeks
of lying in bed.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
You believe in my strength..

59:51.500 --> 59:53.458
...that I am no invalid.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.208
I wish that you were well

59:57.208 --> 59:58.500
and that you could come
and see me

59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.250
so we may live
in the present moment together.

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:03.208
You must promise to get better.

01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:06.667
You are a very,
very remarkable person.

01:00:06.667 --> 01:00:08.583
You are one
perpetual achievement.

01:00:09.917 --> 01:00:12.167
I've settled down
to wanting you..

01:00:14.292 --> 01:00:15.583
...doggedly..

01:00:17.958 --> 01:00:19.125
...dismally..

01:00:22.542 --> 01:00:23.625
...faithfully.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.667
I hope at last this pleases you.

01:00:31.667 --> 01:00:33.583
It's damned unpleasant for me.

01:00:40.708 --> 01:00:43.083
I need to go home.

01:00:43.083 --> 01:00:45.000
It's Virginia, isn't it?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.917
- Salaam alaikum.
- Walaikum salaam.

01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:49.375
A full-blown affair with her

01:00:49.375 --> 01:00:51.375
would be like smoking
over a petrol tank.

01:00:52.167 --> 01:00:53.292
Alhamdulillah.

01:00:56.583 --> 01:00:58.625
God, the next person
who kisses my hand

01:00:58.625 --> 01:01:00.542
will get his face slapped.

01:01:02.708 --> 01:01:04.500
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:10.333
Hypocrisy, Harold.
Brazen hypocrisy.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.917
It's clear to me
that you believe yourself

01:01:22.917 --> 01:01:25.042
to be in love with Virginia.

01:01:25.042 --> 01:01:26.958
So let me say what I couldn't

01:01:26.958 --> 01:01:29.167
during that dreadful confusion
with Violet.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
There are several kinds
of love, Vita.

01:01:37.375 --> 01:01:40.000
Yours for Virginia lives here.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.208
It constricts.

01:01:42.667 --> 01:01:44.208
It panics. It consumes.

01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:48.792
It is selfish and corrosive.

01:01:53.625 --> 01:01:54.667
The other..

01:01:56.917 --> 01:02:01.000
...is an outpouring
of everything good in you..

01:02:03.917 --> 01:02:05.417
...and it lives here.

01:02:08.667 --> 01:02:10.625
It is what I feel for you.

01:02:15.417 --> 01:02:16.958
I'm going back.

01:02:26.417 --> 01:02:28.667
I'm sorry, but she really
mustn't see anyone.

01:02:28.667 --> 01:02:29.875
I'm sure you understand.

01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:32.167
You're sure even I couldn't help
cheer her up?

01:02:32.167 --> 01:02:35.000
It isn't quite so simple
as just cheering her up, Vita.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.750
- Well..
- I'm having trouble convincing her to take a glass of milk.

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:40.667
This may be a little ambitious.

01:02:40.667 --> 01:02:42.458
Of course.

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.250
How silly of me.

01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:47.333
I... I... I don't think you'd be
quite so cross with me

01:02:47.333 --> 01:02:49.333
if you knew how very much
I approve

01:02:49.375 --> 01:02:51.792
of your care of Virginia.

01:02:51.792 --> 01:02:55.833
I just thought I could help ease
things a little for you all

01:02:55.833 --> 01:02:57.667
if she came to stay with me.

01:02:59.292 --> 01:03:03.417
I brought this for you
from Harold's library.

01:03:03.417 --> 01:03:05.375
I thought it might distract you.

01:03:10.625 --> 01:03:13.667
I am good for her,
you know, Leonard.

01:03:13.667 --> 01:03:16.208
I don't doubt
there's some truth in that.

01:03:18.708 --> 01:03:22.208
You will let me know
if she's in any... danger?

01:03:23.708 --> 01:03:24.792
I promise.

01:03:38.292 --> 01:03:41.125
Now she's been able to sleep
for a few hours..

01:03:41.125 --> 01:03:43.542
...and stopped talking
incoherently.

01:03:43.542 --> 01:03:44.792
But she still won't eat.

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:48.667
I'll do what I can
to persuade her.

01:03:53.458 --> 01:03:55.625
What do you think of Ginia
going to stay with Vita?

01:04:00.042 --> 01:04:02.750
- Does Virginia want to see her?
- Yes.

01:04:06.458 --> 01:04:08.375
Maybe it would be good for her.

01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:10.875
Then there's Vita's reputation.

01:04:10.875 --> 01:04:12.458
Well, Vita can try to seduce her

01:04:12.458 --> 01:04:15.042
but she wouldn't get very far,
will she?

01:04:15.042 --> 01:04:17.375
She's not entirely devoid
of physical desire, Nessa!

01:04:20.458 --> 01:04:22.375
Oh, my goodness, Leonard,
of course not.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.625
Well, if you think going to stay
with Vita will do her good..

01:04:31.708 --> 01:04:33.583
...I shan't stop her.

01:04:33.583 --> 01:04:35.875
I know it's very hard on you,
Leonard.

01:04:35.875 --> 01:04:38.250
I simply don't believe
in jealousy, Nessa.

01:04:40.792 --> 01:04:42.000
One must screw it up

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.917
and throw it out
like a useless manuscript.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:11.625
What a relief it is to finally
be alone with you again.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:24.125
I promised Leonard
I'd have you in bed by 11:00

01:05:24.125 --> 01:05:26.292
and I always try
to keep my promises.

01:05:26.292 --> 01:05:28.250
I can't even think of sleeping.

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:30.833
I have a million things

01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:33.500
not so much to say,
as to sink into you.

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:04.375
I wonder if death feels
anything like that.

01:07:08.542 --> 01:07:10.333
It's as if all of a sudden..

01:07:11.583 --> 01:07:12.875
...time gets stuck..

01:07:14.875 --> 01:07:16.583
...and you feel empty.

01:07:18.875 --> 01:07:20.458
Are you happy?

01:07:22.875 --> 01:07:24.000
Yes.

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:29.333
But do I know you
better than before?

01:07:52.917 --> 01:07:55.208
I do think
she is very beautiful, Ginia.

01:07:55.208 --> 01:07:57.875
She's an aristocrat
of an ancient race.

01:07:57.917 --> 01:07:59.750
Well, all that ancestry

01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:02.292
certainly has bred
a perfect body.

01:08:02.292 --> 01:08:04.542
And I thought
you admired her writing.

01:08:04.542 --> 01:08:07.292
Only to rile you, Ginia.

01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:08.792
She's hardly
breaking boundaries.

01:08:08.792 --> 01:08:10.917
Oh, don't be acidic, Clive.

01:08:10.917 --> 01:08:12.792
It isn't easy
for a woman to work.

01:08:12.792 --> 01:08:13.958
No, don't worry, Nessa.

01:08:13.958 --> 01:08:15.500
I'm sure
Vita can console herself

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.500
with her vast wealth
and privilege.

01:08:19.042 --> 01:08:21.957
Come on, Julian.
Let's play your new record.

01:08:21.957 --> 01:08:23.582
I'm relying on your generation

01:08:23.582 --> 01:08:25.582
to get rid of the class system
altogether.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.332
- Come on, Virginia.
- Mm?

01:08:36.332 --> 01:08:39.417
Let us hear about your romance.

01:08:39.457 --> 01:08:42.042
Have you been to bed
with Vita yet?

01:08:43.957 --> 01:08:47.332
- Yes, Duncan. I have.
- You have?

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:50.667
- Vanessa, Leonard will hear.
- I think he probably knows.

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:53.542
And how does it feel?

01:08:53.542 --> 01:08:57.667
I've never experienced
anything so perfectly..

01:08:57.707 --> 01:08:59.832
...indescribably physical.

01:09:06.792 --> 01:09:09.667
The garden is all dug over,
hedges planted

01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:11.417
masses of orange lilies
in the borders

01:09:11.417 --> 01:09:13.000
and new roses in the oil jars.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
So really all we have to do now
is get rid of the poplars

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.957
and remove the lilac
from the bed under the window.

01:09:18.957 --> 01:09:21.375
And remove Mrs. Woolf
from the bed in your room.

01:09:26.375 --> 01:09:27.792
Apart from the fact
that I like the Woolfs

01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:29.625
you must know, Vitti,
that it's dangerous.

01:09:29.625 --> 01:09:33.375
Hadji darling,
please don't be anxious.

01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:37.667
I'm devoted to her as a friend,
but I'm not in love with her.

01:09:37.667 --> 01:09:40.917
It's a spiritual thing.
She grounds me, I think.

01:09:40.917 --> 01:09:44.542
She forces me
to think seriously.

01:09:44.542 --> 01:09:48.292
I've been so wretched and lonely
without you.

01:09:48.292 --> 01:09:51.207
There's absolutely nothing
for you to be jealous about.

01:09:53.417 --> 01:09:55.417
This is not how we live, Vitti.

01:10:15.417 --> 01:10:17.333
I do.

01:10:17.333 --> 01:10:18.792
I do love you.

01:10:23.625 --> 01:10:26.500
All those sparkling minds
you surround yourself with..

01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:30.708
...none of them love you
as much as I love you.

01:10:35.375 --> 01:10:37.875
Leonard's going to be strict
with me.

01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:39.792
He says
I've been doing too much.

01:10:43.042 --> 01:10:45.750
Would you ever leave Leonard
and come away with me?

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:49.125
I'm serious.

01:10:50.875 --> 01:10:52.042
Will you?

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:55.458
- Leave Leonard?
- Yes.

01:10:57.292 --> 01:10:58.417
I can't.

01:11:00.458 --> 01:11:03.167
I'd lose my footing. I..

01:11:03.167 --> 01:11:06.333
I can live in perfect freedom
with him without any fear.

01:11:08.708 --> 01:11:10.667
You know you've broken down
more barriers than anyone

01:11:10.708 --> 01:11:12.958
but I can't.

01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:14.250
I simply can't.

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:22.167
If you leave me stranded,
I will hurt you.

01:11:23.958 --> 01:11:25.417
I know I will.

01:11:33.792 --> 01:11:36.167
Why must you always grasp
for more?

01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:38.250
Mmm.

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:39.333
Even when I'm in bed with you

01:11:39.333 --> 01:11:42.667
you insist
on conjuring fantasies.

01:11:42.667 --> 01:11:46.375
You with your fears,
me with my fantasies.

01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:49.583
Maybe our perversions
simply aren't compatible.

01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:55.250
I don't see
why you couldn't stay with me

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:56.708
for a few days longer.

01:11:56.708 --> 01:11:59.583
You could write perfectly well
at Knole.

01:11:59.625 --> 01:12:01.958
I can't bear delivering you
back to Bloomsbury.

01:12:01.958 --> 01:12:03.958
You know I need to be there
to write clearly...

01:12:03.958 --> 01:12:06.417
I don't like to think of you
all cooped up down there

01:12:06.417 --> 01:12:09.000
with Leonard fussing over you.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.625
I need Leonard.

01:12:11.917 --> 01:12:13.375
And I love him.

01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:16.125
How he makes sure
that I'm settled..

01:12:16.125 --> 01:12:17.542
...that I'm well.

01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:19.042
But you are.

01:12:19.042 --> 01:12:21.208
You are well.

01:12:21.208 --> 01:12:23.792
It's taken me
such a long time to find..

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:26.375
...balance.

01:12:28.917 --> 01:12:30.958
Do you know what I would do
if you weren't a person

01:12:30.958 --> 01:12:32.958
to be so strict with?

01:12:32.958 --> 01:12:36.125
I'd steal my motor
out of the garage tonight

01:12:36.125 --> 01:12:38.625
be in Bloomsbury by 11:00

01:12:38.625 --> 01:12:41.292
and throw stones at your window.

01:12:41.333 --> 01:12:44.333
You'd come down and let me in

01:12:44.333 --> 01:12:46.792
and I'd stay with you all night.

01:12:53.083 --> 01:12:54.917
But you being you, I can't.

01:12:56.542 --> 01:13:00.000
For a different Virginia,
I'd fly to London in the night.

01:13:02.417 --> 01:13:04.875
You have as much of me
as I have to give.

01:13:31.375 --> 01:13:35.000
Vita, if your promise
was a challenge..

01:13:36.625 --> 01:13:38.417
...come then.

01:13:38.417 --> 01:13:39.625
Come tonight.

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:43.125
Chance missed.

01:13:43.125 --> 01:13:44.625
I am so sorry.

01:13:46.167 --> 01:13:48.958
Will you and Leonard
meet Harold and I together?

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:51.875
I was going to suggest
the weekend of the eclipse.

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:54.042
Harold does so much
want you both to come.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.292
I neglected to thank you
for your kind review

01:14:18.292 --> 01:14:20.000
of my book, Virginia.

01:14:21.625 --> 01:14:23.167
It was quite an achievement,
Harold.

01:14:24.542 --> 01:14:26.500
You wrote your characters
as if they were at once

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.167
real and imaginary.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.917
Biographies can enlarge our
understanding of who people really are

01:14:32.917 --> 01:14:37.125
by hanging up mirrors
in odd corners.

01:14:37.125 --> 01:14:39.375
I can't help but think
how essential it is to do so

01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:40.958
when we live in an age
where a thousand cameras

01:14:40.958 --> 01:14:43.917
are pointed at every person
from every angle.

01:14:43.917 --> 01:14:46.042
Newspapers, politics..

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:48.792
...gossip.

01:14:49.958 --> 01:14:51.125
Gossip.

01:14:55.708 --> 01:14:59.917
How do you suppose Vita will be
rendered by her biographer?

01:14:59.917 --> 01:15:02.583
As a diplomat's wife
and a celebrated novelist?

01:15:03.917 --> 01:15:06.542
Or an insatiable lover

01:15:06.542 --> 01:15:08.833
notorious for her trysts

01:15:08.833 --> 01:15:12.292
for the torment to which
she subjected her poor husband?

01:15:17.833 --> 01:15:19.792
I suppose that depends
on how your own chapter

01:15:19.792 --> 01:15:21.583
with Vita will end.

01:16:34.417 --> 01:16:36.042
If we were talking at Charleston

01:16:36.042 --> 01:16:38.333
we'd be surprised to hear
about love.

01:16:39.833 --> 01:16:41.125
Clive says he's worked it out.

01:16:41.125 --> 01:16:43.583
And one spends
three hours a day on food,

01:16:43.583 --> 01:16:47.042
six on sleep, four on work
and two on love.

01:16:47.917 --> 01:16:50.250
Vanessa says ten on love.

01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:52.792
I say a whole day on love.

01:16:52.792 --> 01:16:55.250
I say it's seeing things
through a purple shade.

01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:58.708
But you've never been in love,
they say.

01:17:01.292 --> 01:17:04.458
How many hours do you suppose
one spends on sex..

01:17:06.125 --> 01:17:07.708
...and thinking about it

01:17:07.708 --> 01:17:10.417
turning the sensation of it
over in your mind

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:11.917
the ghost of it?

01:17:12.875 --> 01:17:14.792
Everyone's body
is haunted by it

01:17:14.792 --> 01:17:16.792
long after its reverberations
are over.

01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:22.875
Dearest creature.

01:17:22.875 --> 01:17:24.708
And when I see you again..

01:17:26.625 --> 01:17:28.417
...I want you more and more.

01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:32.917
You like to think of
me unhappy, I know.

01:17:35.292 --> 01:17:37.375
How nice it is of me
to be writing to you

01:17:37.375 --> 01:17:39.375
when you're not
writing to me at all.

01:18:03.625 --> 01:18:04.958
Is she here?

01:18:06.125 --> 01:18:08.000
Vita?

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.667
I haven't seen her anywhere,
but I know Duncan asked her.

01:18:12.083 --> 01:18:14.000
Perhaps she can't get up to town
this week.

01:18:17.375 --> 01:18:18.958
Have you seen Vita, Duncan?

01:18:18.958 --> 01:18:21.667
No, but she answered to me
affirmative

01:18:21.667 --> 01:18:23.625
so I expect we will very soon.

01:18:27.875 --> 01:18:30.375
Leonard, have you seen Vita?

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.375
Please try to keep calm.

01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:07.167
You're extremely late!

01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:11.417
I brought Ben and Nigel
to see mother this afternoon.

01:19:11.417 --> 01:19:12.917
And when I mentioned
I was coming here

01:19:12.958 --> 01:19:14.917
she became hysterical
and started screaming

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:18.125
about all those homosexual
conscientious objectors.

01:19:20.458 --> 01:19:21.750
Vita.

01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:24.625
- Clive, this is Mary Campbell.
- Pleasure.

01:19:24.625 --> 01:19:26.167
- A pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:19:31.917 --> 01:19:34.292
What a fool I've been
to be so open with someone

01:19:34.292 --> 01:19:36.250
who kept strands of themselves
hidden from me.

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:38.542
Oh, darling.

01:19:38.542 --> 01:19:41.458
I can't stand myself like this.

01:19:41.458 --> 01:19:42.750
Enough now, Ginia.

01:19:43.917 --> 01:19:45.750
This must be enough.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.125
Did she say
where she was going?

01:20:04.125 --> 01:20:05.875
She didn't.

01:20:05.875 --> 01:20:07.667
What did you say to her?

01:20:07.667 --> 01:20:10.042
That Vita had betrayed her.

01:20:10.042 --> 01:20:12.333
Why on earth would you say that?

01:20:12.333 --> 01:20:14.083
Because it is the truth,
Leonard.

01:20:14.083 --> 01:20:17.083
There's no use in telling
poisonous truths, Vanessa.

01:20:17.083 --> 01:20:20.417
None at all.
Least of all to Virginia.

01:20:20.417 --> 01:20:21.333
You know that.

01:21:10.042 --> 01:21:11.250
Virginia?

01:21:35.667 --> 01:21:36.708
Leonard..

01:21:38.167 --> 01:21:41.125
...I've had the most
wonderful idea.

01:21:41.125 --> 01:21:43.417
You know how I haven't been able
to screw a word out for weeks.

01:21:43.417 --> 01:21:45.375
No ideas, nothing,
then suddenly..

01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:49.792
it came to me like a fin
rising out of the water.

01:21:49.792 --> 01:21:51.458
I rushed back here,
I dipped my pen in ink

01:21:51.458 --> 01:21:54.208
and I wrote
almost automatically.

01:21:54.208 --> 01:21:56.667
"Orlando, A Biography."

01:21:58.083 --> 01:21:59.625
Who is Orlando?

01:21:59.625 --> 01:22:02.125
A 16th century man
who's also a woman.

01:22:04.708 --> 01:22:06.458
I'll need to get her to talk
about all those ancestors.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:07.792
Who?

01:22:07.792 --> 01:22:09.167
I'll need to get her
to talk about everything.

01:22:09.167 --> 01:22:10.583
- Who?
- Vita!

01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:36.542
Orlando stood stark naked.

01:22:36.542 --> 01:22:38.833
No human being
since the world began

01:22:38.833 --> 01:22:41.583
has ever looked more ravishing.

01:22:41.583 --> 01:22:43.333
His form combined in one

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:46.833
the strength of a man
and a woman's grace.

01:22:46.833 --> 01:22:49.250
We may take advantage
of this pause in the narrative

01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:50.958
to make certain statements.

01:22:50.958 --> 01:22:54.708
Orlando had become a woman,
there is no denying it.

01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:57.333
At the age of 30,
this young nobleman

01:22:57.333 --> 01:22:59.083
had not only had
every experience

01:22:59.083 --> 01:23:00.583
that life has to offer

01:23:00.583 --> 01:23:03.500
but had seen
the worthlessness of them all.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.417
Love and ambition

01:23:05.417 --> 01:23:08.792
women and poets
were all equally vain.

01:23:08.792 --> 01:23:11.292
Literature was a farce.

01:23:11.292 --> 01:23:15.792
Two things alone remained to him
in which he now put any trust

01:23:15.792 --> 01:23:18.125
dogs and nature

01:23:18.125 --> 01:23:20.708
an elkhound and a rosebush.

01:23:20.708 --> 01:23:23.167
The world in all its variety

01:23:23.208 --> 01:23:25.875
life in all its complexity

01:23:25.875 --> 01:23:27.833
had shrunk to that.

01:23:31.958 --> 01:23:36.375
You're going to project me
into the shape of this Orlando?

01:23:36.375 --> 01:23:38.417
Yes, it's all about you.

01:23:38.417 --> 01:23:42.000
Lusts of your flesh
and the lure of your mind.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.708
You'll shoot through time
like an arrow.

01:23:43.708 --> 01:23:46.792
You'll be a man, a woman,
an ancient, a modern.

01:23:46.792 --> 01:23:48.208
- What do you think?
- What fun for you?

01:23:48.208 --> 01:23:50.750
It is to be
a sort of imaginative biography.

01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:52.708
There will be portraits
of your ancestors

01:23:52.708 --> 01:23:54.125
photographs, illustrations.

01:23:54.125 --> 01:23:56.458
And you must dedicate it
to your victim.

01:23:56.458 --> 01:23:59.125
And I'll need to see you
frequently.

01:23:59.125 --> 01:24:02.042
To sit and look at you,
get you to talk

01:24:02.042 --> 01:24:04.125
correct any doubtful points.

01:24:04.125 --> 01:24:06.500
I should like to untwine
and twist again

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:10.083
the very odd,
incongruous strands in you.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.708
Roy and Mary say
they've no hot water.

01:24:14.708 --> 01:24:16.417
Shall I send Parsons
over to them?

01:24:16.417 --> 01:24:19.250
- Yes, Hadji darling.
- Hello, Virginia.

01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:22.792
Roy and Mary Campbell are
staying in our boys' cottage.

01:24:22.792 --> 01:24:23.833
And why not?

01:24:25.333 --> 01:24:28.625
Virginia, I would like
to explain about Mary.

01:24:28.625 --> 01:24:31.333
To... apologize.

01:24:31.375 --> 01:24:33.833
No, please don't.
It would bore me.

01:24:33.833 --> 01:24:35.083
If you've given yourself to Mary

01:24:35.083 --> 01:24:37.167
I'll have no more
to do with you.

01:24:37.167 --> 01:24:38.833
So it shall be written plainly

01:24:38.833 --> 01:24:41.917
for all the world
to read in "Orlando."

01:24:41.917 --> 01:24:46.542
I'm incapable of creating
one perfect relationship.

01:24:46.542 --> 01:24:49.042
I've tried and failed
at doing so my whole life.

01:24:54.333 --> 01:24:56.708
It is a terrible muddle,
isn't it?

01:24:56.708 --> 01:24:58.958
Yes.

01:25:00.833 --> 01:25:02.458
But any vengeance
you want to take

01:25:02.458 --> 01:25:04.417
will lie ready to your hand.

01:25:09.708 --> 01:25:12.042
Now..

01:25:12.042 --> 01:25:15.292
...when was the moment of your
greatest disillusionment?

01:25:17.417 --> 01:25:19.458
The first time I saw a penis.

01:25:25.792 --> 01:25:27.417
Nessa darling, it's supposed
to look like Knole.

01:25:27.417 --> 01:25:28.667
It does look like Knole.

01:25:28.667 --> 01:25:30.167
Don't you think
it looks like Knole, Duncan?

01:25:30.167 --> 01:25:31.250
I'm not getting
in the middle of this.

01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:32.417
That's unlike you.

01:25:34.167 --> 01:25:35.917
I didn't think
you were serious about putting

01:25:35.917 --> 01:25:38.542
real photographs of me
in the book, Virginia.

01:25:38.542 --> 01:25:41.042
I want "Orlando" to feel
as if it could be true.

01:25:42.042 --> 01:25:43.083
Lower.

01:25:49.042 --> 01:25:50.542
I do feel rather exposed.

01:25:50.542 --> 01:25:52.708
And that's exactly
how we want you.

01:25:54.542 --> 01:25:56.875
Sit still, Vita. We've just
got you looking perfect.

01:25:56.875 --> 01:25:59.083
Doesn't she look perfect,
Nessa, hm?

01:25:59.083 --> 01:26:01.292
Hmm. It's looking marvelous,
I think.

01:26:01.333 --> 01:26:03.417
Well, Vita, if you'd try
to relax a little

01:26:03.417 --> 01:26:04.667
it would look even better.

01:26:04.667 --> 01:26:07.042
I'm trying jolly hard,
I assure you, Vanessa.

01:26:08.667 --> 01:26:10.958
Do you think you have to feel
more powerful than someone

01:26:10.958 --> 01:26:12.625
to be sexually attracted
to them?

01:26:13.958 --> 01:26:15.750
My goodness, what a question.

01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:17.958
You do have the air
of the conqueror about you.

01:26:22.375 --> 01:26:25.083
I suppose it does give me
immense pleasure...

01:26:25.083 --> 01:26:26.458
To give pain?

01:26:29.583 --> 01:26:32.292
Do you think yourself
good or bad?

01:26:59.375 --> 01:27:01.000
It was miserable, Hadji.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.167
Draped in an inadequate piece
of pink satin

01:27:03.167 --> 01:27:04.250
with all my clothes slipping off

01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:06.625
whilst they took
endless photographs.

01:27:06.667 --> 01:27:08.250
Virginia was thrilled,
but I couldn't help feeling

01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:10.333
an overwhelming urge to escape.

01:27:10.333 --> 01:27:13.250
- Have you read it?
- No.

01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:15.208
She absolutely won't
let me see a draft.

01:27:15.208 --> 01:27:17.667
- How's Berlin?
- Miserable without you, Vita.

01:27:17.667 --> 01:27:20.042
Yes, I'm desperate
to get to you.

01:27:20.042 --> 01:27:21.875
I feel as if
I'm itching all over.

01:27:21.875 --> 01:27:24.792
- When can you come?
- In a few days, I think.

01:27:27.833 --> 01:27:29.792
Are you sure
all this time with Vita

01:27:29.792 --> 01:27:31.917
isn't too much
of a strain on you?

01:27:34.125 --> 01:27:36.792
Do you not think
I look full of life?

01:27:36.792 --> 01:27:38.750
You do.

01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:40.333
But are you happy?

01:27:40.333 --> 01:27:43.042
I'm rapturously,
ecstatically happy.

01:27:45.167 --> 01:27:47.750
I can revolutionize biography
overnight

01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:50.792
with the story of a hero
who turns into a heroine

01:27:50.792 --> 01:27:53.708
and she turns out to be fiction.

01:27:53.708 --> 01:27:55.625
Which is, of course,
what all biographies are.

01:27:58.417 --> 01:28:00.750
...now are ended.

01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:04.542
These our actors,
as I foretold you

01:28:04.542 --> 01:28:07.375
were all spirits
and are melted..

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.958
...into thin air.

01:28:14.292 --> 01:28:16.958
Must you go?
We have so much work to do.

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:19.625
I must visit Harold in Berlin.

01:28:19.625 --> 01:28:22.583
I can't leave a diplomat without
a dutiful wife for too long.

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:28.417
This is important work, Vita.

01:28:29.833 --> 01:28:32.208
You're part of something
like a revolution.

01:28:32.208 --> 01:28:34.333
There's never been a woman's
biography, not like this.

01:28:34.333 --> 01:28:36.542
Chastity, modesty,
have always prevented it.

01:28:36.542 --> 01:28:38.000
And, of course,
I have neither of those.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.875
I wish you would take
something seriously, Vita.

01:28:40.875 --> 01:28:43.250
I'm trying to capture
your essence.

01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:45.375
Biographies have always
described the things

01:28:45.375 --> 01:28:46.583
that happened to the person

01:28:46.583 --> 01:28:48.458
not the person
to whom those things happened.

01:28:48.458 --> 01:28:50.208
I'm trying to tunnel into you.

01:28:50.208 --> 01:28:52.167
Do you not understand
how important this is?

01:28:52.167 --> 01:28:53.458
How special this is?

01:28:53.458 --> 01:28:55.167
And how lucky I am, I suppose

01:28:55.167 --> 01:28:57.208
to be the great
Mrs. Woolf's muse.

01:28:59.917 --> 01:29:01.875
And what if

01:29:01.875 --> 01:29:05.375
after all that tunneling
you find nothing there?

01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:10.375
Once you've pinned me down
with your pen..

01:29:12.542 --> 01:29:14.333
...what will you do with me?

01:29:17.042 --> 01:29:19.000
Or will you be
finished with me?

01:29:24.833 --> 01:29:26.167
I don't know.

01:31:53.208 --> 01:31:54.833
Lady Sackville.

01:31:54.833 --> 01:31:57.208
I didn't know
I was to expect you.

01:31:57.208 --> 01:32:00.417
I didn't know
I was to expect this.

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:05.292
I don't think you realize
how explosive this is

01:32:05.292 --> 01:32:08.250
from inside your debauched
bohemian bubble.

01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:10.500
But out there in proper society

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:13.167
you're putting Vita
in great danger.

01:32:13.167 --> 01:32:14.500
Vita and her boys.

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:16.458
I gather the only person
who has ever threatened

01:32:16.458 --> 01:32:19.000
to remove Ben and Nigel
from their mother is you.

01:32:24.125 --> 01:32:26.167
You're a mad woman

01:32:26.167 --> 01:32:29.000
whose successful mad desire

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.500
is to separate people
that care for each other.

01:32:33.042 --> 01:32:35.458
Your work has a kind
of violence to it

01:32:35.458 --> 01:32:38.542
that either you're unaware of

01:32:38.542 --> 01:32:41.667
or too reckless to control.

01:32:41.667 --> 01:32:45.833
Thank God you don't have
children of your own.

01:33:27.875 --> 01:33:31.708
- I thought you were in Berlin.
- I was, but now I'm here.

01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:34.333
I have fallen in love
with your vision of me.

01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:38.417
Were you not hurt or angry?

01:33:38.417 --> 01:33:39.917
It struck me that you might be.

01:33:39.917 --> 01:33:42.292
I feel like a mannequin
in a shop window

01:33:42.292 --> 01:33:45.542
on which you've hung a robe
stitched with fine jewels.

01:33:45.542 --> 01:33:47.833
How could you have hung
so splendid a garment

01:33:47.833 --> 01:33:50.167
on such a poor peg?

01:33:50.167 --> 01:33:53.500
Oh, Virginia, it's the wisest

01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.958
richest book I've ever read.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.208
My darling, what are you doing?

01:34:02.667 --> 01:34:04.208
I'm baking a cake.

01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:06.417
Nelly's given notice.
I have guests for tea.

01:34:06.417 --> 01:34:08.375
You'll poison them.

01:34:11.583 --> 01:34:13.750
I've lived in you so long
that now I see you.

01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:17.292
I wonder do you exist
or have I made you up?

01:34:17.292 --> 01:34:20.000
I feel terribly real right now.

01:34:24.417 --> 01:34:26.625
You have found me again.

01:34:29.792 --> 01:34:33.458
I won't be loved
only in a fictitious world.

01:34:33.458 --> 01:34:37.208
Let's go away together now
before the gossip starts.

01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:38.792
Please, Virginia.

01:34:42.417 --> 01:34:44.583
Yes. Absolutely.

01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:51.292
I don't know why you can't say
when exactly you'll be back.

01:34:51.292 --> 01:34:52.833
I need to know
how long we'll be apart.

01:34:52.833 --> 01:34:55.208
Now you're being sentimental.
We don't do that.

01:34:55.208 --> 01:34:58.000
No, I'm being truthful.
It's entirely rational.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.208
I shall worry about you
all the time.

01:34:59.208 --> 01:35:01.375
Leonard, stop.

01:35:01.375 --> 01:35:02.917
You just finished a book.

01:35:02.917 --> 01:35:04.333
You know you'll be fraught
with nerves

01:35:04.333 --> 01:35:05.958
until the reviews come in.
That's the time you go under...

01:35:05.958 --> 01:35:08.708
Well, this time feels different.

01:35:08.708 --> 01:35:11.458
Yes, it does.
This feels different.

01:35:13.542 --> 01:35:15.875
That's why
I don't want you to go.

01:35:15.875 --> 01:35:19.042
Writing "Orlando" gave me the
greatest rapture I've ever known.

01:35:19.042 --> 01:35:20.958
Which is why now is a very
dangerous time for you.

01:35:20.958 --> 01:35:22.958
- I'll be with Vita.
- That's what worries me.

01:35:22.958 --> 01:35:24.542
Oh, your protection of me

01:35:24.542 --> 01:35:26.500
sometimes verges
on the unwholesome.

01:35:35.083 --> 01:35:37.125
I shan't stop you going..

01:35:39.042 --> 01:35:41.792
...but I will ask you
to think very carefully

01:35:41.792 --> 01:35:44.667
about what it is you think
is possible with Vita.

01:39:05.875 --> 01:39:09.167
Virginia, are you alright?

01:39:09.167 --> 01:39:10.917
What are you doing out here?

01:39:12.458 --> 01:39:16.833
I've been wondering if lightning
struck the house, collapsed

01:39:16.833 --> 01:39:19.833
what it would be like
to be crushed to death.

01:39:19.833 --> 01:39:21.333
Oh, my dearest.

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:28.375
I've got it fairly vivid.

01:39:28.375 --> 01:39:30.167
Would it be painful?

01:39:31.792 --> 01:39:33.375
Yes.

01:39:33.375 --> 01:39:36.375
Terrifying? I suppose so.

01:39:36.375 --> 01:39:41.167
A swoon, a drum,
gulps attempting consciousness

01:39:41.167 --> 01:39:44.583
and then dot, dot, dot.

01:39:44.583 --> 01:39:46.042
I can't bear to think
of your dying.

01:39:46.042 --> 01:39:47.958
I don't think
it's gonna happen today.

01:39:49.292 --> 01:39:51.250
I was just imagining it.

01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:53.875
- Don't you do that?
- No.

01:39:53.875 --> 01:39:56.083
I do.

01:39:56.083 --> 01:40:00.667
I do think with intense
curiosity about death.

01:40:00.667 --> 01:40:04.958
It could be a great excitement
like going over Niagara.

01:40:04.958 --> 01:40:06.458
But it is the one experience

01:40:06.458 --> 01:40:08.458
I will never
be able to describe.

01:40:10.708 --> 01:40:15.417
Do you ever feel that you record
things rather than feel them?

01:40:15.417 --> 01:40:17.500
Oh, you're tearing open
that old wound.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.083
You've always thought
I had look on everything

01:40:21.125 --> 01:40:23.583
on everyone, as something
for my pen to exploit.

01:40:23.583 --> 01:40:24.750
No.

01:40:25.958 --> 01:40:27.875
I was thinking about myself.

01:40:36.625 --> 01:40:40.708
There is something about you
that doesn't connect.

01:40:40.708 --> 01:40:42.208
What do you mean?

01:40:43.583 --> 01:40:46.958
You demand utter devotion.

01:40:46.958 --> 01:40:49.250
But it is as if
you are surrounded

01:40:49.250 --> 01:40:51.875
by a cloud of obscure fog.

01:40:53.583 --> 01:40:55.000
And when..

01:40:59.292 --> 01:41:01.458
...when I loved you..

01:41:03.083 --> 01:41:05.167
...it felt as if
you could not reach through

01:41:05.167 --> 01:41:07.667
to take my hand
as I held it out to you.

01:41:12.375 --> 01:41:15.167
It's in your writing.

01:41:15.167 --> 01:41:18.667
Something evasive but sparkling.

01:41:18.667 --> 01:41:21.333
A lack of fidelity, I suppose.

01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:24.750
When you loved me?

01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:27.875
Yes.

01:41:29.083 --> 01:41:30.292
I did.

01:41:31.958 --> 01:41:33.417
Very much.

01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:38.000
And I still do,
but not in the same way.

01:41:47.250 --> 01:41:50.000
So after all that tunneling
into me with "Orlando"

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.375
you found me an empty shell?

01:41:52.375 --> 01:41:54.208
No.

01:41:54.208 --> 01:41:55.583
I listened.

01:41:57.583 --> 01:42:02.125
"If you leave me stranded,
I will hurt you."

01:42:04.625 --> 01:42:08.250
I recorded those words
every way I know how.

01:42:08.250 --> 01:42:12.417
I wrote them down,
I scored them into my heart

01:42:12.417 --> 01:42:16.167
and in "Orlando,"
I set you free.

01:42:16.167 --> 01:42:19.917
I created many versions of you
to live unconstrained.

01:42:19.917 --> 01:42:21.417
I captured Knole.

01:42:21.417 --> 01:42:23.542
I gave you
what you'll never inherit.

01:42:26.417 --> 01:42:28.125
Sometimes I do feel as though

01:42:28.125 --> 01:42:30.750
I observe things
from the outside..

01:42:31.958 --> 01:42:33.917
...rather than feel them.

01:42:35.458 --> 01:42:39.042
Perhaps you care more for things
than for people.

01:42:40.625 --> 01:42:42.500
This place still twists
your heart

01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:44.083
more than any person ever has.

01:42:44.083 --> 01:42:45.917
So you think I'm very cold?

01:42:45.917 --> 01:42:47.417
Quite the opposite.

01:42:48.333 --> 01:42:49.875
Quite the opposite.

01:42:51.417 --> 01:42:54.708
A million candles
burn in you, Vita.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.875
You're an exploding star

01:42:58.875 --> 01:43:02.167
refracting light
across the universe.

01:43:02.167 --> 01:43:04.917
But it means you are incapable
of shining your light

01:43:04.917 --> 01:43:08.042
on one thing,
on one person alone.

01:43:10.458 --> 01:43:11.833
And not..

01:43:12.792 --> 01:43:14.333
...in the end..

01:43:16.875 --> 01:43:18.208
...on me.

01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:26.208
So what happens now?

01:43:30.667 --> 01:43:33.042
The end is already written.

01:43:35.583 --> 01:43:38.917
"Orlando naturally loved

01:43:38.917 --> 01:43:43.292
"solitary places, vast views..

01:43:44.833 --> 01:43:47.458
"...and to feel himself

01:43:47.458 --> 01:43:51.792
forever and ever alone."
