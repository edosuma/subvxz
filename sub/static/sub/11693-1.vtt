00:34.813 --> 00:38.884
<i>Oh, give me a home</i>

00:38.984 --> 00:43.096
<i>Where the buffalo roam</i>

00:43.197 --> 00:51.396
<i>Where the deer and the antelope play</i>

00:51.497 --> 00:55.734
<i>Where seldom is heard</i>

00:55.834 --> 00:59.863
<i>A discouraging word</i>

00:59.963 --> 01:07.346
<i>And the skies are not cloudy all day</i>

01:09.264 --> 01:15.638
<i>Home, home on the range</i>

01:16.730 --> 01:23.947
<i>Where the deer and the antelope play</i>

01:25.322 --> 01:29.518
<i>Where seldom is heard</i>

01:29.618 --> 01:33.647
<i>A discouraging word</i>

01:33.747 --> 01:41.083
<i>And the skies are not cloudy all day</i>

01:42.256 --> 01:50.303
<i>No, the skies
are not cloudy all day...</i>

03:08.917 --> 03:10.994
Stop it!

03:11.095 --> 03:13.187
Go away!

03:17.309 --> 03:19.878
Get a grip, Thompson.

03:19.978 --> 03:24.841
Come on. It's just a deadline.
You got two hours till the presses roll.

03:26.735 --> 03:30.848
Shut up! You'll get words
when I want to give them to you.

03:38.580 --> 03:40.624
No need to panic, huh?

03:44.753 --> 03:46.797
Just another deadline.

03:53.220 --> 03:55.929
I'll just lash together a few raw facts,

03:58.058 --> 04:00.185
little bit of old negro wisdom,

04:01.729 --> 04:03.772
and this nightmare is over.

04:13.991 --> 04:15.851
Nixon.

04:19.038 --> 04:21.940
Come on, easy boy. You never liked this.

04:22.041 --> 04:25.277
Bronco, come on. Bronco, come on.
Fun is fun.

04:25.577 --> 04:27.863
Come on! Lie on your side. Down!

04:27.963 --> 04:29.781
Lie on your side.

04:29.882 --> 04:31.925
Fun is fun.

04:34.386 --> 04:35.996
Good boy, Bronco.

04:40.517 --> 04:42.561
Savage bastards.

04:49.818 --> 04:54.116
There, chew on that gibberish for a while,
you heartless scum.

05:08.504 --> 05:10.547
You've pushed me too far.

05:12.674 --> 05:14.588
Down, Bronco, he's mine!

05:40.035 --> 05:43.989
<i>A thrill a minute, an invention a day</i>

05:45.708 --> 05:49.045
<i>It's the American way</i>

05:49.628 --> 05:53.381
<i>A thrill a minute, an invention a day</i>

05:55.050 --> 06:00.049
<i>It's the American way...</i>

06:02.182 --> 06:06.101
I was deciding to write off this weird town,
makes you sleep forever.

06:18.365 --> 06:24.104
'This wouldn't be the first time I got sucked
into writing about Lazlo, Karl Lazlo esquire,

06:24.204 --> 06:26.746
'attorney at law, my attorney.

06:27.833 --> 06:31.004
'This was the man I counted on
to keep me out of jail in those years.

06:31.846 --> 06:35.240
'Those weird years between
the '60s and the '70s,

06:35.340 --> 06:37.159
'the age of Nixon.

06:37.259 --> 06:39.719
'It was a time to keep your head down.

06:40.429 --> 06:44.583
'I was a working journalist, a hired geek
of sorts, and Lazlo was great company

06:44.683 --> 06:46.710
'and sometimes a good lawyer.

06:46.810 --> 06:51.465
'It was a fast, strange time,
and we worked in fast, strange ways.'

06:51.565 --> 06:55.052
He claimed he was being chased
by Mr Nixon

06:55.152 --> 06:58.013
when his car was attacked
by a swarm of bats.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.515
Bats?

06:59.615 --> 07:03.101
It's obvious he was having
a paranoid drug reaction.

07:03.202 --> 07:08.565
Every 20 minutes, he calls down to the desk,
demands to see his lawyer and hangs up.

07:08.665 --> 07:11.207
He claims he's being held a prisoner.

07:14.088 --> 07:15.697
Uh-oh.

07:15.798 --> 07:17.824
Er, I'm rambling.

07:17.925 --> 07:19.637
Er...

07:22.638 --> 07:28.063
I think I'd better tell my readers that I'm
no longer responsible for anything I write.

07:31.772 --> 07:36.510
Er, I've been without sleep for 80 hours
so I'm beyond simple fatigue.

07:36.610 --> 07:40.138
The hallucinations have stopped,
finally, thank God,

07:40.239 --> 07:42.975
but my adrenaline reserves
are burning out

07:43.075 --> 07:46.228
and I'm staring into the face
of a psychotic freak-out.

07:46.328 --> 07:49.273
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing.

07:49.373 --> 07:50.440
Writing?

07:50.541 --> 07:55.237
Yeah. And my deadline page, too.
I'm pouring it on now. Right on the edge.

07:55.337 --> 07:58.532
But I made a smart move
checking into this place

07:58.632 --> 08:02.286
because, you know,
in case I lose it totally,

08:02.386 --> 08:06.081
I know I'll be safe in the arms
of the sisters of mercy.

08:06.181 --> 08:08.208
What are you writing?

08:08.308 --> 08:10.934
My Attorney Versus American Justice.

08:11.645 --> 08:13.689
Cute title, and, er...

08:14.815 --> 08:17.275
hopefully I'll be able to finish it.

08:39.006 --> 08:40.657
Morning.

08:45.220 --> 08:48.707
Er... let me recommend...
Try a blue one.

08:48.807 --> 08:51.137
A blue one? Really?

09:00.986 --> 09:02.387
Wow!

09:02.488 --> 09:05.098
Little bugger gets right on top of you.

09:05.199 --> 09:06.745
Shit. Shit!

09:09.620 --> 09:12.856
'Dr Roberts, call Dr Bretherton
in administration.

09:12.956 --> 09:15.333
'Dr Roberts, call Dr Bretherton.'

09:23.509 --> 09:26.078
- No! No more, please!
- Sorry.

09:27.080 --> 09:31.250
<i>I've been feeling so wild
There's been a change in your style</i>

09:31.350 --> 09:34.836
<i>You probably thought
that I would never see the light</i>

09:34.937 --> 09:39.174
<i>But now I know
I can feel it in my bones...</i>

09:41.235 --> 09:43.990
<i>Your love is gone without a dime</i>

09:45.322 --> 09:48.392
<i>I'd like to know
Ooh-ooh-ooh</i>

09:48.492 --> 09:50.727
<i>Why you're letting me go</i>

09:50.828 --> 09:53.313
<i>I got a love so right...</i>

09:54.915 --> 09:56.525
Just relax.

09:56.625 --> 09:59.444
Everything's gonna be just fine.

09:59.545 --> 10:01.707
I'll be gone in a second.

10:02.881 --> 10:08.328
<i>Loving you is dangerous
Loving you is dangerous...</i>

10:08.429 --> 10:10.259
Nice day.

10:10.973 --> 10:16.517
<i>Loving you is dangerous
Loving you is dangerous...</i>

10:19.690 --> 10:21.717
Take it easy.

10:21.817 --> 10:24.312
<i>...a change in your style</i>

10:27.322 --> 10:33.103
<i>Girl, I can see it
in the way that you smile...</i>

10:33.203 --> 10:36.078
Five more minutes
then we're out of here.

10:36.915 --> 10:40.277
We could just make it away
with you along, you know.

10:40.377 --> 10:42.321
Student nurse, you know.

10:42.421 --> 10:46.292
Clear-headed.
Used to thinking in terms of crisis.

10:51.330 --> 10:52.874
Bat!

10:55.225 --> 10:59.393
Lazlo. What took you so long?
It's been a nightmare here.

11:00.064 --> 11:02.883
- Bat.
- Ooh. What have you done?

11:02.983 --> 11:05.636
Jeez, she was just fine a minute ago.

11:05.736 --> 11:09.868
Oh, I'm eating her cookie.
Cook, the bat here is Karl Lazlo.

11:11.325 --> 11:14.561
As your attorney,
I advise you to leave this room at once.

11:14.661 --> 11:15.864
Right.

11:17.206 --> 11:20.376
Oh, shit. Good thinking,
we may need this.

11:21.168 --> 11:25.656
- Come on, get your things, let's go, Cook.
- No, she should stay.

11:25.756 --> 11:29.326
We can't leave her in this snake pit,
they'll pick her bones clean.

11:29.426 --> 11:33.789
- Thompson, trust my judgment.
- Not in this instance. She's harmless.

11:33.889 --> 11:37.543
She's good with her hands too,
she made these for me.

11:37.643 --> 11:39.670
Come on!

11:39.970 --> 11:42.214
Oh, jeez.

11:42.314 --> 11:45.391
You'll probably be safer
here, anyway. So...

11:45.491 --> 11:46.802
Mr Thompson!

11:46.902 --> 11:49.929
- Yeah!
- Mr Thompson, open the door.

11:50.737 --> 11:52.057
Mr Thompson.

11:52.157 --> 11:56.029
- Watch out for this fucker.
- You have one of our nurses in there.

11:56.787 --> 12:00.065
All right, er... Vaya con dios.

12:00.165 --> 12:02.818
Shit. Shit!

12:02.918 --> 12:04.998
Shit. Shit!

12:21.770 --> 12:23.814
Ah, shit.

12:46.712 --> 12:49.239
You gotta get this
because it's important.

12:49.339 --> 12:51.533
- Can you drive and...?
- No problem.

12:51.633 --> 12:54.828
The key aspects
are all in the Fourth Amendment...

12:54.928 --> 12:57.539
Great, a basis in reality, that's good.

12:57.639 --> 13:01.752
- ...including the need for probable cause...
- Probable cause? All right.

13:01.852 --> 13:07.424
...and the right for people to be secure
in their homes free from illegal search.

13:07.524 --> 13:10.677
That's the big one.
It's the fucking Constitution.

13:12.696 --> 13:16.266
I mean...
Hey, you're getting all of this too.

13:16.367 --> 13:19.478
- I'm a total professional.
- Good.

13:19.578 --> 13:23.857
Cos this is important stuff, a whole
generation of kids are being screwed.

13:23.957 --> 13:27.694
Their rights are being violated
every day by the police.

13:27.795 --> 13:30.739
They take the kids, rough 'em up,
throw 'em in jail...

13:30.839 --> 13:33.215
- Gestapo tactics.
- Exactly.

13:34.051 --> 13:36.203
All right, spread 'em, hit the wall.

13:36.303 --> 13:38.914
Come on, shut up and get your head down.

13:39.014 --> 13:41.792
- Come on, will you...?
- Spread 'em!

13:41.892 --> 13:44.378
The judges are cold,

13:44.478 --> 13:49.841
they throw the kids in jail, give them
ridiculous sentences, all for headlines.

13:49.942 --> 13:51.295
- You getting this?
- Yep.

13:51.395 --> 13:53.794
Good. Stay with me.

13:56.115 --> 13:58.767
Hey! Goddamn... Hey!

13:58.867 --> 14:00.745
Come back here!

14:08.377 --> 14:10.779
How many people are gonna read this?

14:10.879 --> 14:13.553
About 800,000, a million maybe.

14:16.301 --> 14:18.745
- When is this gonna come out?
- Well...

14:18.846 --> 14:22.799
it was supposed to be in the last issue
but maybe this one.

14:52.504 --> 14:56.074
- When did these come in?
- An hour ago.

14:56.175 --> 14:59.512
I want to see everything.
Page, get up here!

15:12.274 --> 15:13.675
Well?

15:13.776 --> 15:16.637
Nobody's seen him
since he left the hospital.

15:16.737 --> 15:20.724
- Get on the phone.
- You know him, he could be anywhere.

15:20.824 --> 15:24.770
I don't give a shit. You find him.

15:24.870 --> 15:27.189
He owes me a cover story and I want it.

15:27.289 --> 15:31.243
- OK, I'm going, I'm doing, I'm looking.
- Check the bars.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.923
No.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.509
No.

15:45.432 --> 15:47.084
Yes.

15:47.184 --> 15:48.835
- No.
- Yes.

15:48.936 --> 15:52.839
- Mr Lazlo!
- Well... look who's here.

15:52.940 --> 15:55.217
- The master barrister.
- That's right.

15:55.317 --> 15:57.511
Give me the Colts,
the Steelers, the Jets...

15:57.611 --> 16:01.139
- Jasper Russell meet Dr Thompson.
- Hello, Doctor.

16:01.240 --> 16:03.433
I'm taking the Bears,
I can't quit on them.

16:03.534 --> 16:08.230
Excellent bone man.
He specialises in gunshot wounds.

16:08.330 --> 16:10.399
Well, I can give you a cheque.

16:10.499 --> 16:12.818
I know, but...

16:12.918 --> 16:15.028
Well, you know where you can find me.

16:15.129 --> 16:17.172
He's a weirdo, Lazlo.

16:18.006 --> 16:20.784
Lazlo, how are you doing?

16:20.884 --> 16:22.411
Never better.

16:22.511 --> 16:24.705
You know, I really admire you.

16:24.805 --> 16:27.791
- Really?
- Yeah. But you could do a lot better.

16:27.891 --> 16:30.961
- No shit.
- You're strong, you're tough,

16:31.061 --> 16:33.422
you're good, the clients like you.

16:33.522 --> 16:37.092
But it's the wrong rules,
and you're playing the wrong game.

16:37.192 --> 16:41.180
Let me send you some real clients -
divorce, real estate.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.015
That's business, Lazlo.

16:43.115 --> 16:46.185
You can do the cases,
we'll split it down the middle.

16:46.285 --> 16:48.645
We'll make a deal, we'll make money.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.898
- The guy said...
- Money?

16:50.998 --> 16:53.233
...that it wasn't so bad to make money.

16:53.333 --> 16:56.236
- Remember that.
- You mean I'd, er...

16:56.336 --> 17:01.408
make some money and maybe be like your
field representative, handle the overflow?

17:01.508 --> 17:06.704
You're not making any money representing
these jack-offs, and you know it.

17:06.805 --> 17:09.625
- Jack-offs?
- Now you've done it.

17:09.724 --> 17:13.045
You call the people I defend jack-offs?

17:13.145 --> 17:16.131
- Hear ye, hear ye, everybody!
- Calm down!

17:16.231 --> 17:18.759
Look at a man who defends evil people!

17:19.259 --> 17:21.796
Will you guys just knock it off?

17:22.695 --> 17:24.556
Lazlo, God damn it, get down.

17:24.656 --> 17:27.184
Repent! There's still time!

17:27.284 --> 17:31.063
Bless you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
We hear you, Jesus.

17:31.163 --> 17:36.443
Whosoever's name is not written in the book
of life shall be cast into a lake of fire!

17:36.543 --> 17:38.920
Amen! Amen!

17:58.482 --> 18:00.717
- Mr Lazlo.
- Hey, Lazlo.

18:00.818 --> 18:04.346
Hey, Lazlo!

18:04.446 --> 18:07.140
OK, OK, settle down, settle down.

18:07.241 --> 18:09.852
OK, 223 Coal Street, where are you?

18:09.952 --> 18:15.107
We're gonna go inside and make a motion
to suppress the search and seizure.

18:15.207 --> 18:18.819
We're gonna say the cops
didn't have probable cause.

18:18.919 --> 18:21.029
Got it? OK. Livingstone.

18:21.130 --> 18:23.156
You got your old lady?

18:23.257 --> 18:26.535
Good. Billy, we're gonna
get to you this afternoon.

18:26.635 --> 18:28.466
OK, now.

18:29.638 --> 18:31.832
I want you to remember one thing.

18:31.932 --> 18:34.710
Once we get inside, no grab-ass.

18:34.810 --> 18:38.714
No fooling around, no yelling,
no booing, none of that stuff.

18:38.814 --> 18:41.425
Just keep cool and let's do it.

18:41.525 --> 18:44.720
- OK? Come on.
- All right.

18:44.820 --> 18:48.640
...on behalf of the coming defence...

18:48.741 --> 18:50.951
...sheer domestic tranquillity...

18:55.539 --> 18:58.692
Would you be
interested in donating blood, sir?

18:58.792 --> 19:00.944
- Donate? My blood?
- Mmm.

19:01.045 --> 19:06.256
As a matter of fact, I'm here to pick up
some blood. Hope you're my type of girl.

19:08.594 --> 19:12.414
Roll up your sleeve.
This'll prick for just a second.

19:12.514 --> 19:15.301
I'm a doctor, I'm a doctor.

19:16.985 --> 19:19.696
Jesus, I missed. Sorry.

19:19.796 --> 19:22.966
You're moving now, you gotta hold still.

19:23.067 --> 19:27.429
- Here we go. That's a beautiful colour.
- No!

19:27.529 --> 19:29.723
You got a lot of it too. All right!

19:29.823 --> 19:31.683
All right.

19:31.784 --> 19:33.977
OK, hold on, hold on.

19:34.078 --> 19:35.825
All right.

19:36.580 --> 19:40.025
I'm a little cowgirl.
Dabba-dabba-dabba-dabba.

19:40.125 --> 19:42.166
Kiss and make better.

19:42.753 --> 19:44.780
Yeah, all right.

19:44.880 --> 19:49.345
You should do that all the time.
Several times a month, at least.

19:54.056 --> 19:56.500
Lazlo, Lazlo, Lazlo.

19:56.600 --> 20:01.338
The whole calendar is Lazlo. Will I ever get
to ply my trade against anyone else?

20:01.438 --> 20:03.924
Yeah, asshole,
when you stop busting kids.

20:04.024 --> 20:08.470
Remember thou, keep holy the Lord's day.
Honour thy father and mother.

20:08.570 --> 20:11.849
Thou shalt not kill.
Thou shalt not commit adultery.

20:11.949 --> 20:16.395
Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not be
a false witness against thy neighbour.

20:16.495 --> 20:18.539
So this is it. Nice place.

20:20.999 --> 20:23.443
Jeez, you can almost smell the narcs.

20:23.544 --> 20:28.044
There's a certain kind of a stink.
You know that stink? Jesus.

20:29.550 --> 20:33.495
- Where's the chamber of horrors?
- Room six. Grab a seat.

20:33.595 --> 20:35.639
First come, first served.

20:38.567 --> 20:40.335
Get smart, Lazlo.

20:40.836 --> 20:44.172
Look, could you just hold this
for a second?

20:44.673 --> 20:46.715
Just a second.

20:47.860 --> 20:49.903
I'll see you in court.

21:15.804 --> 21:17.682
Everyone rise.

21:30.319 --> 21:32.221
Be seated.

21:32.321 --> 21:34.531
Jesus, it's happening already.

21:40.704 --> 21:43.330
Kind of close quarters
in here, isn't it?

21:44.833 --> 21:46.568
Let's go.

21:46.668 --> 21:51.615
Let's get this thing moving.
Clerk, where are the files?

21:51.715 --> 21:53.759
Come on, we're backed up.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.551
Let's see.

21:59.390 --> 22:04.253
State versus Occupants 223 Coal Street.

22:04.353 --> 22:08.549
Possession, sales marijuana.

22:08.649 --> 22:11.802
623 Paige Street, marijuana.

22:11.902 --> 22:15.180
People versus Kramer, marijuana.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.324
These all yours, Lazlo?

22:20.160 --> 22:22.187
Yes, your honour!

22:27.543 --> 22:30.696
We'll set a hearing
on the Coal Street matter.

22:30.796 --> 22:33.448
How about the 13th?

22:33.549 --> 22:37.411
- What about the motions?
- Motions? What motions?

22:37.511 --> 22:40.247
A motion to suppress
the search and seizure.

22:40.347 --> 22:43.584
- There's a probable cause question...
- Wait.

22:43.684 --> 22:47.504
Have you conferred
with the district attorney?

22:47.604 --> 22:49.631
- Yes.
- And?

22:49.732 --> 22:52.092
I and my clients are going to trial.

22:53.043 --> 22:54.901
You tell him!

22:56.613 --> 22:59.369
How long will these motions take?

23:00.743 --> 23:05.647
An hour, maybe two, maybe more,
I don't know. I have a lot of questions.

23:05.748 --> 23:08.275
For instance,
in the Coal Street matter...

23:08.375 --> 23:12.922
Mr Lazlo, Mr Willins,
would you please approach the bench?

23:21.138 --> 23:24.843
Here, I'll be right back.
Would you mind?

23:25.934 --> 23:29.213
Gentlemen, let's be reasonable.

23:29.313 --> 23:33.231
For 16 crummy joints,
are you kidding me?

23:33.942 --> 23:37.638
I'm gonna take every case to trial,
every one, if I have to.

23:37.738 --> 23:40.696
I can back this place up for six years.

23:41.950 --> 23:44.161
You're making a mistake, Lazlo.

23:45.329 --> 23:48.273
Four, five,

23:48.374 --> 23:50.609
six, seven,

23:50.709 --> 23:53.779
eight, nine, ten...

23:53.879 --> 23:55.989
Marty. Where the hell you been?

23:56.090 --> 23:58.133
Been looking all over for you.

23:58.926 --> 24:01.468
You are not registered at your hotel.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.831
Your rental car is reported stolen.

24:04.932 --> 24:08.961
Personally, I couldn't give a shit,
but you owe me a story.

24:09.061 --> 24:11.104
Is it due? Am I late?

24:11.855 --> 24:15.717
You've got a deadline in 19 hours.
Now where's my story?

24:16.718 --> 24:19.559
It's right in there.
They're working on it.

24:19.659 --> 24:22.568
Great too, incredible story,
it's developing fast.

24:22.668 --> 24:26.770
I think it could be
the best thing I've ever done.

24:26.870 --> 24:28.997
All I gotta do now is write it up.

24:29.665 --> 24:31.775
Write it up?

24:31.875 --> 24:33.919
You've got 19 hours.

24:36.213 --> 24:38.257
You move like a cat, Marty.

24:39.049 --> 24:42.494
37, 38, 39...

24:42.594 --> 24:46.123
Entered? How could you enter?
The door was locked.

24:46.223 --> 24:49.209
You broke down the door
without a warrant.

24:49.309 --> 24:52.462
- I heard a scream.
- You heard a scream.

24:52.563 --> 24:57.676
Are you sure it wasn't laughter? Kids having
a good time, innocent merriment?

24:57.776 --> 24:59.595
No, it sounded like a scream.

24:59.695 --> 25:02.594
Hit him with the Fourth Amendment, Laz.

25:04.408 --> 25:07.978
That's not really appropriate,
the Fourth Amendment.

25:08.078 --> 25:10.105
- You're a law student?
- Yeah.

25:10.205 --> 25:12.232
Don't come on so heavy.

25:12.332 --> 25:14.526
- Why would I ever hire you?
- I'm sorry.

25:14.626 --> 25:17.667
OK, so you went inside.
Then what happened?

25:18.589 --> 25:21.825
I saw one of the defendants make
a furtive movement.

25:21.925 --> 25:24.703
- Like what?
- Shall I demonstrate?

25:24.803 --> 25:27.956
- Please.
- It was like this.

25:28.057 --> 25:30.500
- That's a furtive movement?
- Down into here.

25:30.601 --> 25:34.713
I'd like to demonstrate
that movement just like this.

25:34.813 --> 25:38.592
That's a furtive move
and you were scared and, er...

25:38.692 --> 25:42.137
- then what did you do?
- So I searched him.

25:42.237 --> 25:44.234
And what, in fact, did you find?

25:45.866 --> 25:50.034
- Pack of Marlboros.
- A pack of Marlboro cigarettes.

25:52.664 --> 25:58.111
So instead of just realising you had made
a human error and returning the cigarettes,

25:58.212 --> 26:00.948
you decided to peek inside. Why?

26:01.048 --> 26:05.160
Because I thought that defendant
may have been concealing

26:05.260 --> 26:08.497
a small plastic exploding device
of some kind.

26:08.597 --> 26:11.667
So I opened up the cigarettes,
that's why.

26:11.767 --> 26:15.003
You were looking for a bomb
in a packet of cigarettes?

26:17.064 --> 26:18.590
Take your seat.

26:18.691 --> 26:21.260
I'm sorry.

26:21.360 --> 26:25.013
I'm sorry. I'm in control.
Not sure about these people, though.

26:25.114 --> 26:27.641
Is this man an associate of yours?

26:27.741 --> 26:29.768
No, just a...

26:29.868 --> 26:32.479
just a good American like yourself.

26:32.579 --> 26:34.623
May we proceed?

26:36.542 --> 26:38.819
And although, in all fairness,

26:38.919 --> 26:43.031
I must say your legal rights
might have been better protected,

26:43.132 --> 26:46.869
given my willingness and the willingness
of the district attorney.

26:46.969 --> 26:51.832
I feel compelled to sentence you each
to six months in the county jail.

26:55.144 --> 26:58.213
Six months? Why?
You could've cut off their feet.

26:58.313 --> 27:01.188
Once more
and you're out of the courtroom.

27:02.943 --> 27:05.616
Clerk, best get moving. Next case.

27:11.535 --> 27:13.911
Nice going, Lazlo.

27:15.831 --> 27:18.408
The People versus William Kramer.

27:19.418 --> 27:21.778
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

27:21.879 --> 27:24.837
Looks like you got a good thing
going there.

27:25.966 --> 27:28.994
- So you gave the cop the bag?
- Yeah.

27:29.094 --> 27:31.496
Why? Why didn't you say no?

27:31.597 --> 27:33.640
I don't know.

27:34.892 --> 27:38.337
I guess I thought maybe
nothing would happen to me.

27:38.437 --> 27:41.840
Because, in your mind,
that bag didn't belong to you.

27:41.940 --> 27:43.634
It didn't.

27:43.734 --> 27:48.722
Nevertheless, you were arrested for
possession of one pound of marijuana.

27:48.822 --> 27:51.141
This is your second arrest
for possession.

27:51.241 --> 27:53.936
- Yeah.
- How much did you have the first time?

27:54.036 --> 27:55.783
One joint.

27:56.455 --> 27:59.149
One joint.
And for this you did time in jail.

27:59.249 --> 28:00.943
- Yeah.
- How long?

28:01.043 --> 28:03.019
18 months.

28:04.380 --> 28:07.074
18 months for one joint.

28:07.174 --> 28:09.301
OK, look, er...

28:10.094 --> 28:11.912
who was it?

28:12.012 --> 28:15.966
What was the name of the guy
who gave you the bag of grass?

28:17.685 --> 28:19.878
I don't think he's gonna tell him.

28:19.978 --> 28:22.005
- He's not.
- The kid's tough.

28:22.106 --> 28:24.565
He is tough, and he's not gonna talk.

28:25.567 --> 28:27.730
Do you know his name, Mr Kramer?

28:30.489 --> 28:32.533
You wanna tell him?

28:35.244 --> 28:37.039
OK.

28:40.499 --> 28:43.753
I'm sorry, Judge,
the kid's not a squealer.

28:46.588 --> 28:48.632
Take your seat, Mr Kramer.

28:51.051 --> 28:53.120
The court is still in session, Mr Lazlo.

28:53.220 --> 28:55.264
The defence rests.

29:00.310 --> 29:02.521
Will the defendant please rise?

29:04.398 --> 29:10.929
Any person who transports into this state,
sells, furnishes or gives away any marijuana

29:11.030 --> 29:13.348
- shall be punished...
- What's he doing?

29:13.449 --> 29:16.894
- He's reading the fucking law.
- ...five years to life...

29:16.994 --> 29:21.398
I think you guys should listen.
His honour is reading the sentence.

29:22.582 --> 29:24.735
Fuck off.

29:24.835 --> 29:27.779
- He's your client.
- ...not less than three years.

29:27.880 --> 29:31.033
Do you understand your sentence,
Mr Kramer?

29:31.133 --> 29:32.548
No.

29:35.346 --> 29:37.915
Five years to life.

29:40.559 --> 29:43.295
- Five years?
- Easy, Lazlo.

29:43.395 --> 29:45.505
Did you say five years?

29:45.606 --> 29:48.217
- That's ridiculous. I protest!
- Contempt!

29:48.317 --> 29:50.894
Five fucking years?

29:52.154 --> 29:55.899
It's a travesty of justice.
I will not stand for it.

29:55.999 --> 29:58.894
I will not give you any names.

29:58.994 --> 30:00.554
Smile for the camera.

30:07.226 --> 30:09.655
What does this mean, Lazlo?

30:09.755 --> 30:11.573
Write about it!

30:11.673 --> 30:13.492
Tell the world!

30:13.592 --> 30:16.151
Tell them the truth!

30:27.773 --> 30:30.259
- Here's the story.
- Great, let's have it.

30:30.359 --> 30:34.471
- It's incredible, kid raped by the court...
- Come on, we got two hours.

30:34.571 --> 30:37.057
...and Lazlo's arrested, he's in jail.

30:37.157 --> 30:41.603
- I told him that you'd pay for his bail.
- I can't afford it.

30:41.704 --> 30:44.606
- Doesn't matter, he doesn't want it.
- Good.

30:44.707 --> 30:49.987
He said, "Forget the money, but if Marty
could say some sort of personal prayer

30:50.087 --> 30:52.114
"it'd make a big difference."

30:52.214 --> 30:54.783
No, no, no, don't do this to me, please.

30:54.883 --> 30:56.927
Hell, I'll pray with you.

31:01.098 --> 31:04.056
I can't do this. I can't pray.

31:04.852 --> 31:08.589
Sure you can. Dig deep.
Come on, it's like riding a bicycle.

31:08.689 --> 31:11.300
- I can't pray.
- Come on, come on, come on.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.443
Anybody can.

31:20.325 --> 31:25.288
"Dear God". That'd probably be
a good way to start, something like that.

31:26.582 --> 31:28.609
Dear God, thank you for everything.

31:28.709 --> 31:32.487
- Get Lazlo in there.
- Dear God, thank you for everything,

31:32.588 --> 31:36.283
- and God bless Lazlo too.
- And all the people of the world.

31:36.383 --> 31:39.328
And all the people of the world too.
Let's have it.

31:39.428 --> 31:42.801
- Please, let's have it.
- Do you have the cheque?

31:49.897 --> 31:55.275
You didn't sign this. You gotta sign this.
They won't cash that without your signature.

31:57.529 --> 32:01.863
Glad I caught that.
It's not legal without the signature.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.498
Thanks.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.085
Thank Lazlo.

32:21.428 --> 32:26.708
'Well, that finished him as a lawyer,
at least as a working lawyer.

32:26.809 --> 32:29.336
'And some of it may have been my fault.

32:29.436 --> 32:33.006
'Perhaps I was not the kind of friend
in court Lazlo needed.

32:33.107 --> 32:35.317
'But the humour had gone,
there was nothing to be laughed at.

32:37.111 --> 32:41.098
'By the time we realised,
it was too late for both of us.

32:41.198 --> 32:43.225
'He quit the legal system.

32:43.325 --> 32:45.853
'No more polite talking with judges,

32:45.953 --> 32:48.105
'or journalists either, for that matter.

32:48.205 --> 32:51.400
'He was in a revolution now,
a revolution in acid,

32:51.500 --> 32:56.655
'and, boy, it was hard to find people to eat
acid with as the age of Nixon wore on.

32:56.755 --> 33:00.492
'Reality was too full of disappointments
for a generation

33:00.592 --> 33:06.206
'that grew up too confident to deal with
harsh realities like doom and failure.

33:06.306 --> 33:11.086
'A lot of people got off the boat
in those days, but not everybody.

33:11.186 --> 33:14.590
'Not Lazlo, not Nixon, not me.

33:14.690 --> 33:17.101
'We'd signed on for the whole trip.'

33:20.529 --> 33:22.389
Sir.

33:22.489 --> 33:24.558
Hey, sir. Hey, sir!

33:25.222 --> 33:26.268
Hey!

33:27.104 --> 33:28.353
God!

33:28.454 --> 33:31.031
Is anything wrong?

33:32.791 --> 33:36.413
- Sir, what's wrong?
- My head.

33:38.922 --> 33:40.949
- Your head?
- Who sent you?

33:41.050 --> 33:44.620
- What are you talking about?
- What government agency?

33:44.720 --> 33:47.915
- I think I'd like to find out.
- What are you doing?

33:48.015 --> 33:50.751
- Give me answers!
- What? Yeah, OK.

33:50.851 --> 33:53.311
What? What? What do you want to know?

33:54.313 --> 33:56.840
- Where am I?
- At your hotel, man.

33:56.940 --> 33:58.967
You're at your hotel, honest.

33:59.068 --> 34:02.888
I haven't even caught my plane.
What game is being played here?

34:02.988 --> 34:05.474
No, no, man, you in Los Angeles.

34:05.574 --> 34:09.061
- You've landed right here in Los Angeles.
- Liar!

34:09.161 --> 34:12.688
Check with the hotel,
there's anybody you can ask.

34:12.790 --> 34:14.775
The desk, the bellhop, anybody.

34:14.875 --> 34:18.110
- They really will...
- Wait, you're right.

34:18.212 --> 34:20.489
- OK.
- It's coming back to me now.

34:20.589 --> 34:23.283
- OK.
- I'm here on an assignment.

34:23.384 --> 34:26.495
- Football. Super Bowl.
- Yeah, they're doing that.

34:26.594 --> 34:29.766
You can see the marquee. It's 1972.

34:35.228 --> 34:37.272
The big game, yeah.

34:42.194 --> 34:46.326
Well, sports fans, there is no burrow
for one of these teams.

34:49.618 --> 34:51.311
Brownie?

34:51.411 --> 34:54.286
Yeah, it's Blackie. What's the line?

34:55.623 --> 34:57.651
Nine?

34:57.751 --> 35:00.112
Faffle's got it eight and a half.

35:00.212 --> 35:02.406
Fuck it, I'm going the other way.

35:02.506 --> 35:05.117
Yeah. And put me down for a dime.

35:05.217 --> 35:07.828
Nickel defence.
On the line of scrimmage.

35:07.928 --> 35:09.621
Goes right, fades left...

35:16.612 --> 35:19.339
One man between him and the goal line.

35:21.483 --> 35:26.180
Dr Thompson, Blast magazine.
Is my suite ready? I need supplies sent up.

35:26.280 --> 35:30.744
They're coming out of the woodwork
for this game. Später, yeah.

35:31.660 --> 35:34.563
I'm gonna need an IBM Selectric,
heavy duty,

35:34.663 --> 35:36.874
a Xerox telecopier, the 516.

35:37.708 --> 35:39.651
Teleco...

35:39.752 --> 35:44.031
I'm also gonna need one of those
Sony cassettes, big mother, 1800.

35:44.131 --> 35:47.159
- Big mother.
- Lots of white paper. Heavy bond.

35:47.259 --> 35:50.383
- Heavy bond.
- Bic pens, medium point, blue.

35:51.138 --> 35:52.977
Bic. Er, sir...

35:55.351 --> 35:57.586
- Sir, please.
- Oh...

35:58.486 --> 36:00.255
May as well get the room service order.

36:00.356 --> 36:03.091
- How about three crab Louis?
- Three crab Louis.

36:03.192 --> 36:06.612
- Quart of ice, lots of ice.
- Lots of ice.

36:09.406 --> 36:12.643
Quart of mescal. And 16 grapefruit.

36:12.743 --> 36:15.312
- You getting all this?
- 16 grapefruit.

36:15.412 --> 36:19.248
- Sir, I'm going to need your identification.
- Sure.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.486
Shit! Somebody's stolen my wallet.

36:27.257 --> 36:30.049
- I know what I'm doing.
- Sir...

36:33.555 --> 36:34.998
He must be a doctor.

36:48.779 --> 36:51.903
Thank you very much.
Really appreciate it.

36:55.703 --> 36:57.746
He's all yours.

37:02.876 --> 37:05.112
Ah! Eureka! Nice work.

37:05.212 --> 37:07.239
Ah, back to business.

37:07.339 --> 37:10.701
Two-bedroom suite,
closer to the top the better.

37:10.801 --> 37:15.581
Oh, can you check the electrical outlets?
Gonna need a lot of power.

37:15.681 --> 37:18.437
- 440 volts.
- 440 volts?

37:19.601 --> 37:22.974
- Any problems, check with the magazine.
- Yes, sir.

37:24.314 --> 37:26.508
Thank you.

37:26.608 --> 37:28.652
Front, please?

37:29.486 --> 37:31.430
Not too shabby, huh?

37:34.450 --> 37:36.493
Mr Lewis's office.

37:37.327 --> 37:39.521
May I ask who's calling, please?

37:39.621 --> 37:43.483
Ah, oh, I see.
Could you hold on one sec?

37:43.584 --> 37:47.288
It's the hotel manager.
I think it's about Thompson.

37:52.217 --> 37:53.744
Hello.

37:53.844 --> 37:56.719
Yes, Mr Thompson is an employee of mine.

37:58.432 --> 38:02.765
Why don't you just get to the point
and tell me what he wants?

38:03.812 --> 38:05.643
No problem.

38:06.815 --> 38:09.176
What was that last one?

38:09.276 --> 38:11.320
A video recorder and a stereo?

38:12.154 --> 38:14.473
No. That's out.

38:14.573 --> 38:17.184
Tell him I said he doesn't need that.

38:17.284 --> 38:22.022
Don't worry, I'll be checking with him
shortly. But I do appreciate the call.

38:22.122 --> 38:23.953
Thank you.

38:39.807 --> 38:41.850
He became a man...

38:43.102 --> 38:45.893
the day of the greatest game
ever played.

38:48.899 --> 38:53.345
Everything he knew about decency and
morality, he learned that day in December

38:53.445 --> 38:55.347
from Alan "the horse" Ameche.

38:55.447 --> 38:58.976
Today in the Super Bowl
he would earn his wings.

38:59.076 --> 39:03.956
A crowd had assembled,
a crowd of America's elite.

39:05.958 --> 39:07.985
Toyota salesmen from around the country,

39:08.085 --> 39:11.154
orientals and those suspected
of being orientals,

39:11.255 --> 39:16.910
stacked on the 30 yard line watching him
sweat and wipe caked blood from his face.

39:17.011 --> 39:19.621
The Gallo brothers, Ernest and Julio,

39:19.722 --> 39:22.082
party guys who'd skinned a few Mexicans

39:22.182 --> 39:27.546
and forced them to carry them on their
shoulders to the pregame tailgate parties.

39:27.646 --> 39:30.465
The Pepsi and Coca-Cola
bottlers of America.

39:30.566 --> 39:33.773
Coke adds life, it's the real thing.

39:34.653 --> 39:38.724
Bombarded by missiles,
flying, flaming matchbook covers.

39:39.624 --> 39:42.978
The waterheads from General Motors
up in the top seats,

39:43.078 --> 39:46.023
where they belong,
getting the worst pollution.

39:46.123 --> 39:50.670
All sorts of twisted motherfuckers there.
And who could this be?

39:51.962 --> 39:54.042
What?

39:55.716 --> 40:00.845
All right, put him through, but no more
after this. I'm serious, I mean it.

40:02.264 --> 40:06.335
'Marty. I just found out
about an incredible story, a bizarre plot.

40:06.435 --> 40:09.129
'Washington is trying
influence the game.'

40:09.229 --> 40:13.091
- Hunter, please.
- 'This could have far-reaching implications.'

40:13.192 --> 40:17.513
- Soviets could be involved.
- 'I'm sure you'll get to the bottom of it.'

40:17.613 --> 40:21.767
I don't know, this could take a few months,
I could run out of money fast.

40:21.867 --> 40:23.477
Besides, I just got here...

40:23.577 --> 40:26.939
- You just got there?
- 'Yeah, minutes ago.'

40:27.039 --> 40:29.900
You left on Tuesday. Today's Saturday.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.778
You too? The same mix-up happened to me.

40:32.878 --> 40:36.927
I thought it was Tuesday... Saturday,
everybody was here.

40:53.357 --> 40:54.758
Room service!

40:54.858 --> 40:57.135
I'll check on it. Hold on.

40:57.236 --> 40:59.202
What?

41:01.073 --> 41:03.319
What?

41:07.228 --> 41:09.203
Hold on, somebody's here.

41:17.339 --> 41:20.048
Come on in.
Where the hell have you been?

41:27.975 --> 41:30.018
You'll be safe here.

41:42.489 --> 41:44.533
I'm on the phone.

41:47.316 --> 41:48.187
Marty?

41:48.287 --> 41:50.731
- 'I'm still here.'
- Yeah.

41:50.831 --> 41:55.694
I may need some more money.
I'm entertaining in the room and it runs up.

41:55.794 --> 41:57.654
'OK, OK, enough.'

41:57.755 --> 42:00.282
Er, sit, sit, señor.

42:00.382 --> 42:02.618
I got people from the consulate here.

42:02.718 --> 42:05.537
'What has that to do
with the Super Bowl? '

42:05.637 --> 42:08.726
- What the hell was that noise?
- 'What noise? '

42:09.600 --> 42:12.794
Get the goddamn tap off the phone!

42:12.895 --> 42:16.019
You think you're playing
with children here?

42:21.779 --> 42:24.848
Are you OK now? Good.

42:24.948 --> 42:29.478
'I OKed everything you asked for except
the stereo and the video recorder.'

42:29.578 --> 42:33.190
- How am I gonna see the game?
- 'Ever heard of a press box? '

42:33.290 --> 42:37.903
Shit, then you miss the slow-mos,
the instant replay, all that stuff.

42:38.003 --> 42:40.239
'I don't care about any replay.

42:40.339 --> 42:45.586
'Thompson, are you hearing me?
I want 10,000 words by deadline Sunday! '

42:46.595 --> 42:48.664
You don't want any bogus journalism.

42:48.764 --> 42:51.667
Not after your picture was in Newsweek
playing horsey.

42:51.767 --> 42:54.476
Go long. El zono finale.

42:55.688 --> 42:57.839
'I want 10,000 words, Thompson.'

42:57.940 --> 43:00.150
Head for the sunset! Deeper, deeper!

43:00.943 --> 43:03.095
'Do you hear me? '

43:06.667 --> 43:08.684
You all right?

43:08.784 --> 43:10.769
Oh, good.

43:10.869 --> 43:13.939
Direct pressure is best.
I'll get a Band-Aid.

43:14.039 --> 43:17.609
We're getting some noise complaints
up on 20.

43:17.710 --> 43:20.404
- We'll check it out, sir.
- Do that.

43:23.048 --> 43:26.743
Excuse me. You guys,
come here for a minute, will you?

43:26.844 --> 43:28.245
- What's your name?
- Briggs.

43:28.345 --> 43:29.955
- Danny.
- Blackie.

43:30.055 --> 43:33.667
Tomorrow's Super Sunday,
I gotta get a super rest.

43:33.767 --> 43:38.005
You look like you know what you're doing.
Get down the hallway...

43:38.352 --> 43:41.425
and throw a muzzle over that fruitcake.

43:41.525 --> 43:44.052
- I'll take care of it.
- This is for you.

43:44.153 --> 43:46.763
- You're gonna take care of it?
- Yeah.

43:46.864 --> 43:49.641
Fuckin' A, you will. Right over there.

43:49.742 --> 43:52.019
No more calls, God damn it!

43:52.119 --> 43:54.563
I want some discipline
on that front desk.

43:54.663 --> 43:57.816
Does the name Vince Lombardi
mean anything in this town?

43:57.916 --> 44:00.411
Hollywood scum. All right.

44:01.545 --> 44:03.655
Rose!

44:03.756 --> 44:07.034
Rose, you turned it over, sorry.
It's our ball.

44:07.134 --> 44:09.261
Angel, let's do it.

44:11.388 --> 44:14.460
Your conversions are gonna tell a story.

44:20.814 --> 44:23.508
Go down... behind the bar.

44:24.209 --> 44:25.636
I'll look for you.

44:26.036 --> 44:29.064
Right, she's in that Dallas flex.

44:29.365 --> 44:32.768
Five-three! 58!

44:32.868 --> 44:35.312
- 19 blue!
- Louder. Help him.

44:35.412 --> 44:36.605
Hello?

44:36.705 --> 44:39.117
Pork chop! Hut-hut!

44:40.000 --> 44:42.044
Forced to scramble!

44:45.130 --> 44:46.842
Touchdown!

44:47.633 --> 44:49.048
Touchdown.

44:49.968 --> 44:53.330
Hold it, come on.
I got a key here someplace.

44:53.430 --> 44:56.708
- Just don't let him bullshit you.
- Hey.

44:56.809 --> 44:59.503
Don't worry about a thing. I got it.

45:00.377 --> 45:04.258
Watch the linebacker. Pick him up! Dah!

45:04.358 --> 45:07.197
- Shit.
- Briggs. Oh, Briggs?

45:08.028 --> 45:09.443
Briggs?

45:11.073 --> 45:13.650
Brownie? Yeah, it's Blackie.

45:14.243 --> 45:16.286
Did the price change?

45:17.079 --> 45:19.704
I didn't sleep a wink
since I spoke to you.

45:23.544 --> 45:26.335
'Super Sunday. Dawn.

45:27.131 --> 45:30.753
'My recollections of the last 12 hours
are very dim.

45:31.760 --> 45:35.372
'All that I know for certain is that,
shortly after I checked in,

45:35.472 --> 45:39.167
'two Third World drug abusers
dressed as hotel employees

45:39.268 --> 45:43.338
'forced their way into my room,
ransacked it,

45:43.439 --> 45:46.925
'drank all my liquor, did all my drugs,

45:47.026 --> 45:49.052
'stole my dinner.

45:49.153 --> 45:55.350
'If security isn't beefed up at this hotel,
I'm looking for safer accommodations.

45:55.451 --> 46:01.023
'It's a sad state of affairs when this reporter
has to go heavily armed to breakfast.'

46:01.123 --> 46:04.985
And what a breakfast it is.
Still alive, still kicking.

46:05.085 --> 46:07.112
Er, could I have another round?

46:07.212 --> 46:11.158
- Of cocktails?
- Everything. Cocktails, food.

46:11.258 --> 46:15.287
Super Sunday, you gotta store up energy.
Could go into sudden death.

46:15.387 --> 46:17.633
Ah. Yeah.

46:20.517 --> 46:23.725
Enjoying myself?
I'm in a fucking nuthouse.

46:26.857 --> 46:29.635
Sir, you can't come in here
looking like that.

46:29.735 --> 46:32.888
I'm the President of the United States

46:32.988 --> 46:35.697
and I can do anything I want.

46:40.704 --> 46:42.731
Hi, guy.

46:43.842 --> 46:46.401
Brownie, this you wouldn't believe.

46:46.502 --> 46:48.545
All bets off, I'm coming home.

46:50.130 --> 46:52.282
Hi. Sock it to me!

46:52.383 --> 46:54.576
Fellow Americans. Ha-ha-ha.

46:54.677 --> 46:58.809
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- There's one of them.

47:00.224 --> 47:03.846
Oh, boy, Thompson,
you always knew this could happen.

47:08.870 --> 47:11.273
- Well?
- You look good.

47:14.543 --> 47:16.586
Sock it to me.

47:18.672 --> 47:22.092
- Does he want a menu?
- Cottage cheese and ketchup?

47:22.968 --> 47:25.723
No, thanks, we're in... sort of a rush.

47:26.847 --> 47:28.890
Thank God for that.

47:33.311 --> 47:35.755
Lazlo. What happened to you?

47:35.856 --> 47:39.092
Hey, man, I brought you a present, man.

47:39.192 --> 47:41.236
Go ahead, try it on.

47:44.656 --> 47:47.475
Come on, hurry up. We gotta get moving.

47:47.576 --> 47:50.312
- Moving?
- We got a lot of ground to cover.

47:50.412 --> 47:53.701
- Let's get out of here.
- I can't get out of here.

47:54.332 --> 47:58.486
- I can't go.
- Thompson, this is me. Lazlo.

47:58.587 --> 48:02.449
I know. I saw you in the mask,
I said, "Hey, that's Lazlo."

48:02.549 --> 48:07.120
- I'm here in the flesh.
- I'm sure there's a reason for that too.

48:07.220 --> 48:10.332
- I've got a deadline to meet.
- Deadline?

48:10.432 --> 48:15.670
- I gotta do this story.
- What? You're not a fucking sportswriter.

48:15.771 --> 48:19.716
- Oh, that hurts.
- I don't see you for three fucking years

48:19.816 --> 48:24.054
and you have the nerve to sit there
and tell me you got a deadline.

48:24.154 --> 48:26.827
Now come on before I get pissed off.

48:28.033 --> 48:33.313
Get your souvenir pennants here.
Dallas, Miami, we got 'em here.

48:33.413 --> 48:35.941
Nothing good can come from this.

48:36.041 --> 48:38.276
- Relax.
- Relax?

48:38.377 --> 48:41.363
You grabbed me
off an important assignment

48:41.463 --> 48:44.115
to go on who knows
what kind of freakout.

48:44.216 --> 48:46.047
Excuse me.

48:46.802 --> 48:48.828
There we go.

48:48.929 --> 48:52.207
Get your programmes. I got programmes.

48:52.307 --> 48:54.767
Get your pennants here.

48:57.729 --> 48:59.756
It's good weed.

48:59.856 --> 49:03.276
I got caps, I got Dallas Cowboy caps...

49:19.459 --> 49:23.154
Say, do you fellas like football?

49:23.255 --> 49:24.656
Say what?

49:24.756 --> 49:27.659
I got a couple Super Bowl tickets here.

49:27.759 --> 49:29.578
Let me see.

49:29.678 --> 49:32.289
These look good. How much you want?

49:32.389 --> 49:35.292
Who's talking sell? Let's talk trade.

49:35.392 --> 49:39.809
- Trade?
- Yeah, say, er... that ticket for...

49:40.689 --> 49:42.465
that bottle of wine.

49:42.566 --> 49:45.440
That ticket... for that wine?

49:47.904 --> 49:50.140
Good.

49:50.240 --> 49:52.267
- Nice hat.
- That is a beauty.

49:52.367 --> 49:55.103
- I like the hat.
- The hat for the ticket?

49:55.203 --> 49:57.981
- That's great.
- Seems fair.

49:58.081 --> 49:59.482
Great.

49:59.583 --> 50:01.610
Here. You'll need these.

50:01.710 --> 50:04.905
- What are they?
- These'll get you into the press box.

50:05.005 --> 50:08.366
- Press passes.
- Room keys.

50:08.467 --> 50:10.577
Good thinking.

50:11.277 --> 50:14.039
Here. Go on up,
have a drink before the game.

50:14.139 --> 50:16.541
- This your room?
- Yeah, all paid for.

50:16.641 --> 50:18.472
Thank you.

50:21.146 --> 50:23.215
Have a nice Super Bowl Sunday.

50:23.315 --> 50:25.146
You too.

50:29.488 --> 50:32.658
Tickets, and passes, and a key?

50:38.372 --> 50:42.567
- Some shit going down somewhere.
- Tough.

50:42.667 --> 50:45.528
KEEP ON CHOOGLIN')

50:45.629 --> 50:48.823
<i>Keep on chooglin', chooglin'</i>

50:48.924 --> 50:51.466
<i>Chooglin'...</i>

50:52.552 --> 50:54.596
I tried to call you a few times.

50:56.598 --> 50:58.708
Yeah, well, I moved out of town.

50:58.809 --> 51:01.503
Yeah, consolidate your winnings, huh?

51:01.603 --> 51:04.005
Yeah, be proud, man.

51:04.106 --> 51:07.551
You're becoming a famous writer.
The famous Dr Gonzo.

51:07.651 --> 51:11.263
I can't account for
how people deal with it, you know.

51:11.363 --> 51:13.640
I've done OK. Shit...

51:13.740 --> 51:16.268
You know what I really liked, though?

51:16.368 --> 51:19.437
That column where you tried to find out
where I was.

51:19.538 --> 51:23.108
You were missed, Lazlo,
by a lot of people.

51:23.208 --> 51:25.750
Not by me, of course, but...

51:27.504 --> 51:29.916
I got a new approach now, a new plan.

51:30.674 --> 51:33.368
I wish you luck in your new endeavour.

51:35.971 --> 51:38.098
<i>Keep on chooglin'</i>

51:39.015 --> 51:41.012
<i>Keep on chooglin'</i>

51:41.852 --> 51:43.879
<i>Keep on chooglin'</i>

51:43.979 --> 51:48.149
<i>Chooglin', chooglin',
chooglin', chooglin'</i>

52:01.580 --> 52:04.039
- Come on.
- I got it.

52:08.545 --> 52:10.655
Come closer, man. Closer.

52:10.756 --> 52:12.866
OK, there you go. Ah...

52:12.966 --> 52:14.576
Phew!

52:14.676 --> 52:17.349
You know, I'm an endangered species.

52:18.272 --> 52:21.726
Kind of like the buffalo.

52:23.143 --> 52:25.837
Like, a lot of people
thought I was dead,

52:25.937 --> 52:32.510
but you don't write any postcards
when you're on the road to self-discovery.

52:32.611 --> 52:36.723
I mean, the journey to enlightenment
is a long trip

52:36.823 --> 52:39.059
and that's the way it is, you know?

52:39.159 --> 52:43.230
You just keep going further and further
and deeper and deeper

52:43.330 --> 52:46.733
into higher and higher realms
of consciousness.

52:48.668 --> 52:52.027
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir, I think so.

52:52.576 --> 52:53.907
You've been there too, huh?

52:54.007 --> 52:57.786
- I think so, sir.
- Course he has. Look at his eyes.

52:57.886 --> 53:02.386
- I just don't pick up anybody hitchhiking.
- Yeah, yeah.

53:04.559 --> 53:07.683
I have been completely reborn.

53:08.647 --> 53:10.809
I am a new man.

53:12.317 --> 53:15.192
- Nyuh!
- I've been to outer regions.

53:16.113 --> 53:19.724
And I've walked with the king.
You dig it?

53:19.825 --> 53:22.060
I have walked with the king!

53:22.160 --> 53:26.022
I've stood on the mountain,
I saw all the earth, man!

53:26.123 --> 53:29.526
- It's all over myself here.
- And he talked back.

53:29.626 --> 53:34.406
He talked back. He said,
"It's all right, man. It's all right."

53:34.506 --> 53:36.550
We were all right.

53:38.135 --> 53:41.037
Well, this is all good news.
Very comforting.

53:41.138 --> 53:42.539
This is empty.

53:42.639 --> 53:45.430
I think I'd like to get out pretty soon.

53:46.017 --> 53:47.669
Oh.

53:47.769 --> 53:50.213
You don't wanna get out around here.

53:50.313 --> 53:52.891
No, hey, we're your friends. Relax.

53:53.525 --> 53:55.356
Lazlo...

53:56.987 --> 53:59.660
you may have been wrong about him.

54:00.782 --> 54:03.324
He may not... fit in.

54:04.036 --> 54:06.521
How much do you think he knows?

54:06.621 --> 54:09.149
Enough to put us in personal danger.

54:15.839 --> 54:18.199
Boy. That kid was sick.

54:18.300 --> 54:22.037
- Why did you pick him up?
- He needed help.

54:22.137 --> 54:25.915
He was out of his mind. What is with you,
picking up weirdos? I knew right away.

54:26.015 --> 54:28.803
I can spot 'em a mile away.

54:28.985 --> 54:30.837
He could've done serious damage.

54:30.937 --> 54:34.393
- I like to help people.
- He had a wooden hand.

54:36.693 --> 54:38.720
I thought he was just tense.

54:45.994 --> 54:47.771
'Mr Lewis? '

54:47.871 --> 54:50.565
I'm sorry, there's no answer, Mr Lewis.

54:50.665 --> 54:55.296
That's impossible. Just keep ringing.
I'm certain he's up there.

55:22.739 --> 55:25.068
Hello? Hello?

55:26.034 --> 55:28.708
Hunter? Hunter what?

55:29.371 --> 55:32.607
'Ain't nobody doin'
no huntin' up here, fool!'

55:32.708 --> 55:36.661
'This is a party, not a safari!'

55:55.427 --> 55:58.008
'...Cowboys were a better team.

55:58.108 --> 56:00.927
'Dallas, its second trip here.

56:01.027 --> 56:05.473
'Because of media hype, the news media,

'as the Miami Dolphins are,

56:14.458 --> 56:18.570

'by winning one of the great
football games of...'

56:48.617 --> 56:50.727
Come on, let me show you around.

56:54.623 --> 56:57.150
Is this the old Baby Face Nelson place?

56:57.250 --> 56:59.277
You guys know American gangsters?

57:00.397 --> 57:03.593
Homeboy to T1. Homeboy to T1.

57:05.759 --> 57:08.370
You remember Billy?

57:08.470 --> 57:12.207
He got paroled after three years.
He's joined our cause.

57:12.307 --> 57:15.877
- Glad you could make it, man.
- I couldn't miss this,

57:15.977 --> 57:18.982
when the old gang gets back for a hoot.

57:19.981 --> 57:24.135
- I don't know how long I'm gonna stay.
- Don't worry, man.

57:24.236 --> 57:27.847
As your ex-attorney,
I advise you not to worry.

57:27.948 --> 57:31.902
Homeboy to T1. Homeboy to T1.

57:32.828 --> 57:35.916
She's terrific. I met her in Vegas.

57:40.669 --> 57:43.989
- Lazlo, it's Rojas, he's coming.
- Perfect.

57:44.089 --> 57:47.200
- Right on schedule.
- Rojas?

57:47.300 --> 57:50.389
Yeah, Rojas.
Come on, everybody, let's go.

58:14.369 --> 58:16.104
Lazlo!

58:16.204 --> 58:18.248
Compañero.

58:20.375 --> 58:23.361
¿ Como estás? Esto es Lazlo.

58:23.462 --> 58:27.866
Nos tiene los rifles, las pistolas,
las granadas, las bombas.

58:27.966 --> 58:29.797
¡Todo lo que necesitamos!

58:32.262 --> 58:34.706
Is this your new A party list?

58:34.806 --> 58:38.460
Odd-looking group.
Then you always did have strange friends.

58:38.560 --> 58:41.129
Associates. You are my friend.

58:41.229 --> 58:43.590
Oh, that's good to know.

58:43.690 --> 58:47.941
- Puedo?
- Whoa, whoa. Un momentito.

58:56.536 --> 58:57.938
Para ti.

59:00.415 --> 59:03.089
¡Mira lo que veo!

59:04.044 --> 59:06.621
¡Mira que belleza!

59:07.839 --> 59:11.284
Pero yo nunca había visto
un ametralladora así!

59:11.385 --> 59:13.215
Mira!

59:14.721 --> 59:17.195
You gave this man a gun?

59:18.433 --> 59:21.514
Perfecto. Sí.

59:22.145 --> 59:24.089
No.

59:24.189 --> 59:26.731
Es como una mujer!

59:34.241 --> 59:36.533
Playful little puppy, isn't he?

59:54.845 --> 59:57.055
Muy buenos rifle.

59:57.806 --> 59:59.914
Muy fast.

01:00:11.383 --> 01:00:12.596
¡Pendejo!

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.558
Quite a staff you got here.

01:00:16.658 --> 01:00:20.874
Cara tan linda, coño, ven aca.

01:00:22.539 --> 01:00:25.650
Un tequilita, un tequilita.

01:00:25.751 --> 01:00:28.755
Lazlo, what kind of weirdness is that?

01:00:30.547 --> 01:00:32.824
Look, man...

01:00:32.924 --> 01:00:38.413
We need you to write about our movement.
There's an airplane coming in later.

01:00:38.513 --> 01:00:41.541
- Airplane?
- These people are our brothers.

01:00:41.641 --> 01:00:44.836
They got a struggle
and I wanna help 'em.

01:00:44.936 --> 01:00:48.298
- You should be part of it.
- These are your brothers?

01:00:48.398 --> 01:00:51.301
This cheap imitation General Patton
out here?

01:00:51.401 --> 01:00:56.556
I oughtta Mace the fucker for that cheap
trouncing he gave his buddy. Fuck you!

01:01:03.997 --> 01:01:06.024
It's history, man.

01:01:06.124 --> 01:01:09.544
Guns, dope, armed insurrection.

01:01:10.212 --> 01:01:12.489
Peasant land seizure.

01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:13.990
Dig it.

01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:16.534
Ghost riders, anarchist prophets,

01:01:16.635 --> 01:01:18.828
fire, blood...

01:01:18.929 --> 01:01:20.842
revolution!

01:01:21.598 --> 01:01:24.417
Oh, it's a grand, grand tale, Laz.

01:01:24.518 --> 01:01:27.754
It's right up there
with Gone With The Wind.

01:01:27.854 --> 01:01:30.882
I'm all for dope and goats,
nobody's bigger,

01:01:30.982 --> 01:01:35.554
but, you know, crazed dope lawyer
turns gun-running revolutionary,

01:01:35.654 --> 01:01:37.681
I'm pounding it up in my head

01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:42.060
and I think you should take me back
to the hotel and I'll finish the story.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:45.188
Don't give me this shit,
I'm counting on you.

01:01:45.288 --> 01:01:47.649
You gotta write a story.
I need your help.

01:01:47.749 --> 01:01:51.820
Lazlo, look out there,
these guys are piranhas with guns.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.738
They stop their own.

01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:57.659
Hey, guns don't scare me, buddy.
I'm a weapons expert.

01:02:02.145 --> 01:02:04.358
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.

01:02:04.458 --> 01:02:05.667
Oh, no.

01:02:05.767 --> 01:02:08.378
Oh, gee, what a mix-up. Sorry.

01:02:08.478 --> 01:02:10.088
Oh, my God. Jeez.

01:02:10.188 --> 01:02:12.841
Billy, you wanna turn on the game?

01:02:12.941 --> 01:02:15.317
See if there's a score, Bill, yeah.

01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:21.683
'Half-time here at Super Bowl VI
with Dallas leading Miami only 10 to 3.

- 'Hi, Momma! '
- 'Get him outta here! '

01:02:40.677 --> 01:02:42.871
'I wanna say hi to Big Bertha... '

01:02:42.971 --> 01:02:47.886
- 'Sir, you'll have to leave.'
- 'Do you see this fat fucker? '

01:03:20.717 --> 01:03:23.177
Hey, man, I'm glad you're here.

01:03:36.566 --> 01:03:40.189
Who's your favourite group?
The Stones or the Beatles?

'This is T1 to Homeboy. Over.'

01:03:45.033 --> 01:03:48.895
- This is Homeboy.
- 'I am six miles east at 900 feet.'

01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:55.026
Over there. Yeah, on that ridge.

01:03:55.127 --> 01:03:57.170
We see you, you're dead ahead.

01:03:57.921 --> 01:03:59.965
Billy, light the runway.

01:04:36.543 --> 01:04:39.195
Truthfully now,
have you done this before?

01:04:39.296 --> 01:04:41.887
Many, many times.

01:04:48.096 --> 01:04:50.140
OK, everybody, let's go.

01:04:53.226 --> 01:04:57.505
Please! You can't leave your car here.
Give me your keys, I'll run it back.

01:04:57.606 --> 01:04:59.649
Come on, come on.

01:05:00.442 --> 01:05:03.220
It's your car,
somebody's gonna steal it.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.181
- ¡Ándale, ándale!
- Move it!

01:05:06.281 --> 01:05:09.851
Move it, pronto!
Get it in there, get it in there.

01:05:09.951 --> 01:05:11.561
Put it in there.

01:05:11.661 --> 01:05:13.647
Partner.

01:05:16.416 --> 01:05:18.610
Move it, come on! Move it!

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:21.668
Vamos, muchachos. Let's go.

01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:27.744
Holy shit.

01:05:38.105 --> 01:05:39.982
Come on!

01:05:41.108 --> 01:05:44.135
- This guy a friend of yours?
- Grab the fuckin' box!

01:05:44.236 --> 01:05:46.263
Can I carry something?

01:05:46.363 --> 01:05:48.194
Yeah.

01:05:51.743 --> 01:05:53.787
Hey... whoa!

01:05:59.318 --> 01:06:01.570
Come on! Hunter!

01:06:03.964 --> 01:06:07.325
- Come on, man!
- Fascisti swine!

01:06:07.426 --> 01:06:10.099
Bastards! Playground strafers!

01:06:10.804 --> 01:06:13.540
- This car is a classic!
- ¡Ándale!

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:16.877
Hey! Hey! Thompson!

01:06:19.271 --> 01:06:22.608
Red alert! Red alert!

01:06:41.543 --> 01:06:44.750
I don't think
we'll be doing this again, Lazlo.

01:07:00.562 --> 01:07:03.686
Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo!

01:07:10.072 --> 01:07:14.267
Dr Thompson, where've you been?
We've been waiting for you.

01:07:14.368 --> 01:07:16.895
- Come on. Are you OK?
- Quit whining.

01:07:16.995 --> 01:07:19.648
- I... I was just...
- You've upset me already,

01:07:19.748 --> 01:07:21.917
calling me first thing in the morning...

01:07:22.017 --> 01:07:25.487
- Holy Jesus.
- No, we're going out there now.

01:07:25.587 --> 01:07:28.823
I don't think so.
You've whipped them into a frenzy.

01:07:28.924 --> 01:07:32.619
- Only a fool would go in there.
- They really want to see you.

01:07:32.719 --> 01:07:35.539
They probably mean business.
This isn't right.

01:07:35.639 --> 01:07:38.959
Come on.
I think it's gonna be all right.

01:07:39.059 --> 01:07:41.962
- You look just fine.
- I know I look great

01:07:42.062 --> 01:07:45.131
- but I don't feel too confident.
- Stay right there.

01:07:45.232 --> 01:07:48.510
- I'll be right back. Stay right there.
- Well, er...

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:50.428
Gonzo! Gonzo!

01:07:50.529 --> 01:07:52.264
OK!

01:07:54.574 --> 01:07:57.143
They got the real woodpeckers
here today.

01:07:58.025 --> 01:08:01.106
OK, you guys, I know
you've been waiting a long time

01:08:01.206 --> 01:08:03.774
but he's here, so you'll get him.

01:08:18.974 --> 01:08:21.220
OK, quiet down, everybody.

01:08:22.435 --> 01:08:24.183
OK, great.

01:08:24.854 --> 01:08:29.009
OK, as you all know, Dr Thompson
is working on the campaign.

01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:34.139
He's on a very tight schedule, so keep
the questions brief and one at a time.

01:08:34.238 --> 01:08:36.683
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr Thompson.

01:08:50.671 --> 01:08:52.282
Me, me, me!

01:08:53.185 --> 01:08:54.658
Let's start here.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:59.005
- Er, Dr Thompson...
- Any questions? What?

01:09:00.085 --> 01:09:01.758
In your recent pieces
about the candidate,

01:09:01.859 --> 01:09:05.587
you're having difficulty
getting to see him. Why is that?

01:09:05.687 --> 01:09:08.298
Well, I think we keep different hours.

01:09:10.942 --> 01:09:16.305
Probably most of it, he calls me,
I'm not in. I return his call, he's out.

01:09:16.406 --> 01:09:18.515
He calls back, gets my machine.

01:09:18.617 --> 01:09:22.354
I call him back, he's under sedation.
It goes on.

01:09:22.453 --> 01:09:25.857
Cos I thought it had
something to do with this article

01:09:25.957 --> 01:09:31.571
where you called him a treacherous hack
and a vermin-filled ex-wart healer

01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:36.743
who should be castrated so that his genes
aren't passed on to future generations.

01:09:42.557 --> 01:09:45.042
Did I say that?

01:09:45.143 --> 01:09:48.796
Well, I must have meant it
if I said it. So...

01:09:48.897 --> 01:09:51.466
I owe him an apology or nothing at all.

01:09:51.566 --> 01:09:54.594
If you get to see him,
what are you gonna say?

01:09:54.694 --> 01:09:56.930
Well, er...

01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:59.736
I'm gonna tell him
to wear brighter colours.

01:10:01.326 --> 01:10:03.236
He, er...

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:08.775
Shut up. I'll talk.

01:10:08.875 --> 01:10:11.361
Why do you think they gave me this?

01:10:11.461 --> 01:10:14.281
Dr Thompson,
for those of us who are writers...

01:10:14.381 --> 01:10:15.865
Oh.

01:10:15.966 --> 01:10:20.161
Yeah? Those of us? Shall we raise
our hands so we know who we are?

01:10:20.262 --> 01:10:25.041
Could you tell me if you thought drugs
and alcohol would make me a better writer?

01:10:25.542 --> 01:10:28.003
That's a good question.

01:10:28.103 --> 01:10:30.130
Let me see.

01:10:53.128 --> 01:11:00.285
In my case, I hate to advocate drugs
or liquor, violence, insanity, to anyone,

01:11:00.385 --> 01:11:02.662
but in my case it's worked.

01:11:02.763 --> 01:11:05.957
We have another question right here.

01:11:06.058 --> 01:11:10.355
Dr Thompson, er, are you gonna write
any more articles about Lazlo?

01:11:11.605 --> 01:11:13.648
Lazlo, my attorney?

01:11:15.025 --> 01:11:16.635
No.

01:11:16.735 --> 01:11:19.763
- No, he's dead.
- How's that?

01:11:19.863 --> 01:11:24.017
He hasn't been heard from for some time
and he's believed dead.

01:11:24.117 --> 01:11:29.022
Well, it always seemed to me
that, er, he really didn't exist,

01:11:29.122 --> 01:11:31.166
that he was a figment of your writing.

01:11:33.085 --> 01:11:37.948
You couldn't invent someone like Karl Lazlo.
He was one of a kind, a mutant.

01:11:40.926 --> 01:11:43.635
A real heavyweight water buffalo type.

01:11:45.222 --> 01:11:48.750
Who could, er, chew his way through
a concrete wall

01:11:48.850 --> 01:11:52.629
and spit out the other side
covered with lime and chalk

01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:55.215
and look good in doing it.

01:11:55.315 --> 01:11:57.857
He, er, he was one of a kind, and, er...

01:12:19.756 --> 01:12:23.702
<i>Well, I'm here, well, I'm ready</i>

01:12:23.802 --> 01:12:27.747
<i>For all these people
to take this flight</i>

01:12:27.848 --> 01:12:31.793
<i>I wrote my song and I brought my money</i>

01:12:31.893 --> 01:12:35.562
<i>But I'm still on this plane tonight</i>

01:12:44.322 --> 01:12:47.851
<i>The people on the highways</i>

01:12:47.951 --> 01:12:51.855
<i>All these strangers go with you too</i>

01:12:51.955 --> 01:12:55.817
<i>Are we free and are we ready?</i>

01:12:55.917 --> 01:13:00.002
<i>We're always wrong...</i>

01:13:03.425 --> 01:13:07.704
- Hey, Dooley! When do I get the interview?
- I'll take care of you.

01:13:07.804 --> 01:13:10.373
You've been saying that
for days, Dooley.

01:13:10.474 --> 01:13:13.084
I would appreciate it
because I have to file.

01:13:13.185 --> 01:13:17.839
The candidate is very interested in you,
he reads your clippings every day,

01:13:17.939 --> 01:13:19.966
I make sure he sees them.

01:13:20.067 --> 01:13:21.695
- Dooley...
- Yeah?

01:13:28.125 --> 01:13:30.030
Excuse me.

01:13:35.499 --> 01:13:37.943
Thank you. Oh, hi.

01:13:38.043 --> 01:13:39.874
Oh, excuse me.

01:13:41.088 --> 01:13:42.835
Excuse me.

01:13:45.509 --> 01:13:48.217
- Somebody sitting there?
- Er, no.

01:13:49.679 --> 01:13:51.723
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.

01:14:10.033 --> 01:14:13.074
They never search me. Honest face.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.568
Fortunate it's me and not some maniac.

01:14:19.668 --> 01:14:21.945
You could raise
some real hell with this.

01:14:22.045 --> 01:14:26.177
Torture a stewardess, hold the pilot
at bay, slash all the wiring.

01:14:37.352 --> 01:14:39.379
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

01:14:39.479 --> 01:14:41.939
Lot of C in there, vitamin C.

01:14:43.066 --> 01:14:47.447
Well, I get very greedy with my supplies
once we're airborne.

01:14:54.578 --> 01:14:57.037
Back on board the campaign special.

01:14:57.789 --> 01:15:03.361
Just made the plane after a flock
of poisoned ravens dive-bombed my car.

01:15:03.462 --> 01:15:07.449
The candidate is probably under sedation
in his compartment.

01:15:07.549 --> 01:15:12.370
Last night he was at the hotel pool
doing stunt dives for two cocktail waiters

01:15:12.471 --> 01:15:14.716
who were skinny-dipping in the pool.

01:15:15.682 --> 01:15:19.085
Screamed, "Watch my cannonball,"
went high into the air,

01:15:19.186 --> 01:15:21.213
landed right on his testicles.

01:15:21.313 --> 01:15:25.550
Be tough to watch his speech today knowing
his balls are the colours of the rainbow.

01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:28.428
OK, Thompson, up.

01:15:28.528 --> 01:15:33.016
Special session with the candidate, I guess.
Watch my stuff and I'll share my notes.

01:15:33.116 --> 01:15:35.894
Bring your stuff, you're off the plane.

01:15:35.994 --> 01:15:38.188
You can't throw me off.
I have the proper credentials.

01:15:38.288 --> 01:15:40.357
I decide who goes on what plane.

01:15:40.457 --> 01:15:44.486
From now on, you're on the zoo plane
with the technicians.

01:15:44.586 --> 01:15:48.782
Dooley, let him stay. He's got
as much right to be here as any of us.

01:15:48.882 --> 01:15:51.534
Don't push your luck, Lisogor.

01:15:51.635 --> 01:15:55.968
This is a cruel and bitter defeat,
and one that I probably won't forget.

01:15:56.890 --> 01:15:58.934
I'm not gonna worry about it.

01:16:17.911 --> 01:16:20.981
Would you like a beer?

01:16:21.081 --> 01:16:25.110
<i>Oh, give me a home</i>

01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:29.322
<i>Where the buffalo roam</i>

01:16:29.423 --> 01:16:37.622
<i>Where the deer and the antelope play</i>

01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:41.918
<i>Where seldom is heard</i>

01:16:42.018 --> 01:16:46.131
<i>A discouraging word</i>

01:16:46.231 --> 01:16:52.137
<i>And the skies
are not cloudy all day...</i>

01:16:52.237 --> 01:16:57.809
In the event of sudden loss of cabin
pressure, oxygen masks will be released.

01:17:00.037 --> 01:17:02.314
- Hi.
- Wouldn't let you up there?

01:17:02.414 --> 01:17:04.733
A minor setback, that's all.

01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:09.029
- Thank you, you're very sweet.
- Hut-hut! Hut!

01:17:09.129 --> 01:17:10.530
Ooh!

01:17:33.862 --> 01:17:36.932
- You're Harris from the Post, aren't you?
- Right.

01:17:37.032 --> 01:17:39.893
That was nice stuff
on the Florida primary.

01:17:39.993 --> 01:17:44.147
You were the only one who had
the blue collar vote on the button.

01:17:44.247 --> 01:17:47.025
- Incomplete.
- Is it always like this here?

01:17:47.125 --> 01:17:49.736
It's usually worse.
Everyone's getting up.

01:17:49.836 --> 01:17:54.866
Thank God I'm only on for one stop. I don't
know how my backup man can stand it.

01:17:54.966 --> 01:17:59.182
It gets real ugly late in the day
when they start cooking.

01:18:18.532 --> 01:18:21.643
Jesus, why do they have to make
so much noise?

01:18:21.743 --> 01:18:25.272
Hey, how about shutting up?
A little charity, huh?

01:18:27.749 --> 01:18:29.793
Hey, you don't look too good.

01:18:30.293 --> 01:18:35.156
- My head feels like it's caving in.
- I had the same thing this morning.

01:18:35.257 --> 01:18:37.450
You got some aspirin there?

01:18:37.551 --> 01:18:41.538
These are prescription
but they'll take care of your headache.

01:18:41.638 --> 01:18:43.790
They won't put me to sleep?

01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:45.375
Oh, no.

01:18:45.475 --> 01:18:48.017
They'll relax you, though, quite a bit.

01:18:58.196 --> 01:19:01.474
- Whoa!
- Jesus, who's flying this thing?

01:19:01.575 --> 01:19:04.060
Oh, one of the gang.

01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:06.354
One of these people?

01:19:06.455 --> 01:19:11.251
Several of us are qualified
but this guy hasn't had much experience.

01:19:12.419 --> 01:19:15.739
Listen, I think I'd like one of those,
if that's OK.

01:19:15.839 --> 01:19:18.283
Don't tell anybody where you got 'em.

01:19:18.383 --> 01:19:21.119
- I'll take two.
- Good, that's what I took.

01:19:25.807 --> 01:19:28.100
- Here.
- Ah, thanks.

01:19:29.936 --> 01:19:33.724
I never had any complaints
about the blue ones.

01:19:34.733 --> 01:19:36.564
Mmm.

01:19:42.991 --> 01:19:45.143
Listen to what Thompson's written.

01:19:45.243 --> 01:19:48.104
"The candidate,
and his crew of shameless enforcers,

01:19:48.205 --> 01:19:50.774
"brought their weird act to Wisconsin,

01:19:50.874 --> 01:19:55.654
"passing out free hits of black acid
to anyone who could stick out his tongue."

01:19:55.754 --> 01:19:58.240
- Acid?
- "A truly remarkable way

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:00.383
"of getting votes."

01:20:10.102 --> 01:20:12.504
Make way! Make way!

01:20:14.731 --> 01:20:17.143
Harris from the Post!

01:20:18.839 --> 01:20:20.573
Is coming through!

01:20:21.196 --> 01:20:25.016
Where is he?
Where is my friend Thompson?

01:20:25.117 --> 01:20:27.310
Thompson?

01:20:31.289 --> 01:20:33.608
Thompson! Thompson!

01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:35.819
It's Harris from the Post!

01:20:35.919 --> 01:20:40.657
<i>Look for the girl
with the sun in her eyes</i>

01:20:40.757 --> 01:20:42.837
<i>And she's gone</i>

01:20:45.137 --> 01:20:50.052
<i>Lucy in the sky with diamonds!</i>

01:20:51.351 --> 01:20:56.131
<i>Lucy in the sky with diamonds!</i>

01:20:57.176 --> 01:21:02.404
<i>Lucy in the sky with diamonds!</i>

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.570
Who's this?

01:21:07.284 --> 01:21:09.909
Harris from the Post!

01:21:11.913 --> 01:21:14.232
It's my turn to fly!

01:21:14.332 --> 01:21:16.776
- Oh, jeez.
- Does he have a licence?

01:21:16.877 --> 01:21:20.405
He's not instrument rated though.
I don't think he should.

01:21:20.505 --> 01:21:22.699
I feel... wonferdul.

01:21:22.799 --> 01:21:25.577
You're looking good. OK.

01:21:25.677 --> 01:21:30.040
All right, big fella, let's go have
a cocktail or something.

01:21:30.223 --> 01:21:32.751
All right. Yeah, I told her about you.

01:21:36.646 --> 01:21:39.925
We got an emergency here!
Swine, open the door!

01:21:40.025 --> 01:21:42.235
I'll be out in a second.

01:21:50.327 --> 01:21:53.647
All right, let me have
your attention, please.

01:21:53.747 --> 01:21:56.274
Keep moving, just listen to me.

01:21:56.375 --> 01:22:01.571
The candidate will be speaking at the Loving
Care senior citizens centre at 12:45.

01:22:01.671 --> 01:22:06.618
We will reassemble here at 2:30,
takeoff's at three o'clock. Don't get lost.

01:22:06.718 --> 01:22:09.829
Once again, the candidate...

01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:13.833
will be speaking at the Loving... Care
senior citi... zens centre...

01:22:13.934 --> 01:22:17.307
Excuse me, have you seen Mr Harris
from the Post?

01:22:19.981 --> 01:22:25.845
<i>Lucy in the sky with diamonds</i>

01:22:25.946 --> 01:22:27.722
Mr Harris, what happened?

01:22:27.823 --> 01:22:34.790
<i>Ah, Lucy in the sky with diamonds</i>

01:22:45.298 --> 01:22:47.659
What's all this?

01:22:47.759 --> 01:22:49.803
Harris from the Post.

01:22:50.721 --> 01:22:53.394
How you doing, boys? Good to see you.

01:23:11.283 --> 01:23:13.778
Hiya, sir. Harris from the Post.

01:23:14.494 --> 01:23:16.538
Good to see you again.

01:23:20.459 --> 01:23:22.485
Can I get anything for you, sir?

01:23:22.586 --> 01:23:24.654
How's the family, Harris?

01:23:24.755 --> 01:23:28.009
The family? Oh, that's bad news.

01:23:29.009 --> 01:23:32.704
The screwheads finally came
and took my daughter away.

01:23:32.804 --> 01:23:34.831
Let me ask you a question, sir.

01:23:34.931 --> 01:23:37.936
What is this country doing
for the doomed?

01:23:40.604 --> 01:23:43.798
There are two kinds of people
in this country.

01:23:43.899 --> 01:23:45.508
The doomed...

01:23:45.609 --> 01:23:47.302
and the screwheads,

01:23:47.402 --> 01:23:52.849
savage tribal thugs who live off
illegal incomes, burrowed deep out there.

01:23:52.949 --> 01:23:55.977
No respect for human dignity.

01:23:56.078 --> 01:23:59.481
They don't know
what you and I understand.

01:23:59.581 --> 01:24:01.650
You ever play football, Harris?

01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:03.735
Yes, sir.

01:24:03.835 --> 01:24:06.905
Thank you, sir. I played in college.

01:24:07.005 --> 01:24:10.867
They're gonna get your daughter too.
I've heard their rallies.

01:24:10.967 --> 01:24:13.213
They like Julie, but Tricia...

01:24:14.846 --> 01:24:17.804
And they really hate you, sir.

01:24:20.602 --> 01:24:23.797
You know that one half
of the state senate...

01:24:23.897 --> 01:24:27.352
of Utah... are screwheads?

01:24:29.319 --> 01:24:33.431
You know, I was never really
frightened by the...

01:24:33.532 --> 01:24:35.030
bop-heads.

01:24:35.784 --> 01:24:40.497
And the potheads with their silliness
never frightened me either.

01:24:42.207 --> 01:24:44.500
But these goddamn screwheads...

01:24:46.378 --> 01:24:48.113
they terrify me.

01:24:58.014 --> 01:25:00.058
And the poor doomed,

01:25:00.851 --> 01:25:04.687
the young and the silly and the honest,

01:25:06.314 --> 01:25:08.550
and weak,

01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:10.694
and Italians,

01:25:12.154 --> 01:25:14.180
they're doomed.

01:25:14.281 --> 01:25:17.434
They're lost, they're helpless,

01:25:17.534 --> 01:25:20.562
they're somebody else's meal.

01:25:20.662 --> 01:25:23.204
They're like pigs in the wilderness.

01:25:25.876 --> 01:25:27.919
Come here, Harris.

01:25:29.129 --> 01:25:30.960
Come here.

01:25:31.882 --> 01:25:33.878
Fuck the doomed.

01:25:42.267 --> 01:25:45.212
Move it along, no need to run.

01:25:45.312 --> 01:25:48.465
- Just get on the plane.
- Wait for me.

01:25:48.565 --> 01:25:53.637
This is it, right up here. Take your seats,
we take off in a few moments.

01:25:53.737 --> 01:25:55.779
Hey, Dooley...

01:25:57.908 --> 01:26:00.727
You wanna pick that up,
take it with you?

01:26:00.827 --> 01:26:02.729
Pick that up, take it with you!

01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:13.420
Would you like a cocktail?

01:26:14.841 --> 01:26:17.799
Do you happen to have two aspirin?

01:26:24.518 --> 01:26:26.044
Holy shit.

01:26:26.144 --> 01:26:28.188
Not here.

01:26:40.701 --> 01:26:44.156
- Is this seat taken?
- No, sit down.

01:26:46.707 --> 01:26:49.025
- Is something wrong?
- Yeah.

01:26:49.126 --> 01:26:51.152
No, nothing is wrong.

01:26:51.253 --> 01:26:54.614
I just thought maybe I'd forgotten
my medicine.

01:26:54.715 --> 01:26:57.506
Here it is. Everything's in order now.

01:27:08.687 --> 01:27:11.858
Say, uh... if anyone asks...

01:27:12.899 --> 01:27:15.260
this seat right here is taken.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:21.016
It's highly unlikely but I may have to flop
around in case I have one of my seizures.

01:27:21.116 --> 01:27:23.825
Seizures?

01:27:28.457 --> 01:27:30.287
Excuse me.

01:27:33.795 --> 01:27:36.207
Oh, I'm sorry, this seat is taken.

01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:40.201
- No, it isn't.
- But this man is...

01:27:40.302 --> 01:27:42.797
- He's capable of seizures.
- Shh.

01:27:44.473 --> 01:27:46.516
That's better.

01:27:48.018 --> 01:27:50.061
No, no, just relax.

01:27:52.064 --> 01:27:53.478
Good.

01:27:55.484 --> 01:27:56.898
This is terrific.

01:27:58.945 --> 01:28:02.224
No question,
you got something going here, Hunter.

01:28:02.324 --> 01:28:05.435
Harris. My name is Harris.

01:28:05.535 --> 01:28:08.271
Ooh, Harris, right, I got it.

01:28:08.372 --> 01:28:10.315
Undercover, right?

01:28:10.415 --> 01:28:14.694
- Maybe I should sit somewhere else.
- No, no, no, you're fine.

01:28:14.795 --> 01:28:17.005
But... I don't wanna sit here.

01:28:18.465 --> 01:28:20.367
Trust me.

01:28:20.467 --> 01:28:21.882
OK?

01:28:24.888 --> 01:28:26.873
So, man...

01:28:26.973 --> 01:28:29.292
you surprised to see me?

01:28:29.393 --> 01:28:31.211
You bet.

01:28:31.311 --> 01:28:35.465
You have no idea how much trouble
I had tracking you down,

01:28:35.565 --> 01:28:40.611
- all the zipping around you do.
- I got a nutty, nutty schedule, Laz.

01:28:41.405 --> 01:28:43.682
Yeah, well, anyway...

01:28:43.782 --> 01:28:45.825
we got some business to do.

01:28:47.119 --> 01:28:50.622
- We have business?
- Oh, yeah. Big business.

01:28:52.207 --> 01:28:56.403
Now... Jesus, I got so much stuff here,
I don't know where to start.

01:28:58.630 --> 01:29:00.949
This is it.

01:29:01.049 --> 01:29:04.828
Land. Our land.

01:29:04.928 --> 01:29:07.122
Acres and acres of it, man.

01:29:07.222 --> 01:29:09.266
Square miles of land.

01:29:10.267 --> 01:29:12.559
- Well?
- Sounds good.

01:29:13.478 --> 01:29:17.382
I'm gonna be in San Francisco Tuesday.
We should get together.

01:29:17.482 --> 01:29:22.095
Hey, man, that's no good.
We gotta move on this now.

01:29:22.195 --> 01:29:23.722
Look at this.

01:29:23.822 --> 01:29:28.702
- These guys you can trust, I trained 'em.
- Honest... honest faces, all of 'em.

01:29:29.953 --> 01:29:32.875
Here. Look at this. Look at the body.

01:29:33.707 --> 01:29:35.750
She's down there waiting for you.

01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:38.503
I picked her out myself.

01:29:41.465 --> 01:29:43.508
Hey.

01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:47.746
This is Harris of the Post,

01:29:47.846 --> 01:29:52.167
er, experiencing extreme turbulence,
and we're still on the ground.

01:29:52.267 --> 01:29:53.919
Holy Jesus.

01:29:54.019 --> 01:29:57.255
Er, the forecast is for bad greasiness.

01:29:57.355 --> 01:29:59.758
Don't you understand, man?

01:29:59.858 --> 01:30:03.345
This'll be like having our own country,
the two of us.

01:30:03.445 --> 01:30:06.681
It'll be like paradise, man,
like a fucking paradise!

01:30:06.782 --> 01:30:11.311
You wise-ass son of a bitch. You're off
this campaign. Give me your credentials.

01:30:11.411 --> 01:30:13.855
- Hold on.
- Give them to me right now.

01:30:13.955 --> 01:30:16.274
Hey, calm down.

01:30:16.375 --> 01:30:20.278
Calm down? Who are you? Who is he?
Who is this fat clown?

01:30:20.379 --> 01:30:22.456
Fat clown?

01:30:22.556 --> 01:30:26.451
Yeah, fat clown.
Do I have to repeat myself all the time?

01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:31.081
You psychotic,
you've done it to me again.

01:30:31.181 --> 01:30:34.334
It's for your own good.
You don't belong here.

01:30:34.434 --> 01:30:36.146
Ooh, look out.

01:30:37.604 --> 01:30:40.131
It's just a drill, just a drill.
Stay down.

01:30:40.232 --> 01:30:43.343
- Dooley, are you all right?
- Thank you.

01:30:43.443 --> 01:30:45.178
Dooley, heads up.

01:30:47.864 --> 01:30:49.695
Stay back!

01:30:54.496 --> 01:30:56.523
How do you stop this thing?

01:31:00.502 --> 01:31:03.196
It's stuck. What the hell?

01:31:03.296 --> 01:31:06.908
Agh! It wasn't, you swine!
You know it wasn't stuck.

01:31:07.008 --> 01:31:09.169
Oh, my God.

01:31:09.269 --> 01:31:11.300
Back there, whoo!

01:31:25.026 --> 01:31:28.179
Oh, that was great, man.
Just like the old times.

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:32.058
- Jesus.
- Don't worry, we'll write a new story.

01:31:32.159 --> 01:31:35.312
You are a menace to yourself
and those around you.

01:31:35.412 --> 01:31:40.327
You can't stay on that plane, you'll dry up.
You're a creative man, a writer.

01:31:41.001 --> 01:31:43.111
It did take a while to rile them up.

01:31:43.211 --> 01:31:46.489
They're not your people.
I'm your people, man.

01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:49.743
We're right on schedule.
Truck's over here. Let's go.

01:31:49.843 --> 01:31:53.038
- I'm not coming.
- You're not coming?

01:31:53.138 --> 01:31:55.624
I can't, you're insane, you're a maniac.

01:31:55.724 --> 01:31:57.918
You're fortunate
I haven't turned you in.

01:31:58.018 --> 01:32:00.462
Hey, man, what are you talking about?

01:32:00.562 --> 01:32:05.675
- I got this organised. Look at it.
- There's nothing there. It's rocks and dirt.

01:32:05.776 --> 01:32:08.678
- That's the idea. We'll build.
- Build what?

01:32:08.779 --> 01:32:11.890
You already live
in the land of the weird.

01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:15.018
Fuck, man, you're a writer.
Use your imagination.

01:32:15.118 --> 01:32:20.232
- All right. Oh, there's buildings there.
- We'll build a goddamn paradise!

01:32:20.332 --> 01:32:22.859
Our own place, you and me.

01:32:22.959 --> 01:32:25.654
We got land, we got dope, we got women.

01:32:25.754 --> 01:32:28.114
What kind of women would go there?

01:32:28.215 --> 01:32:30.742
- That's not it, man.
- I'm not coming.

01:32:30.842 --> 01:32:34.120
You gotta be my partner,
like it's always been, man.

01:32:34.221 --> 01:32:36.248
Fifty-fifty.

01:32:36.348 --> 01:32:38.391
Yeah, but I'm not coming.

01:32:41.978 --> 01:32:43.838
It's blowing away!

01:32:43.939 --> 01:32:46.591
Hey, come on, help me.

01:32:46.691 --> 01:32:48.510
Hunter, come on.

01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:53.932
You're my friend. Help me. It's gonna be
great, man. It's gonna be paradise.

01:33:25.272 --> 01:33:27.103
Hot damn.

01:33:27.983 --> 01:33:30.218
So much for the facts.

01:33:30.318 --> 01:33:33.526
Bronco, listen to this,
tell me what you think.

01:33:36.491 --> 01:33:41.062
"Well, I guess if I had to swear
one way or another,

01:33:41.163 --> 01:33:43.899
"I'd say Lazlo wasn't insane.

01:33:43.999 --> 01:33:46.375
"He just had very strange rhythms.

01:33:47.252 --> 01:33:50.530
"But he stomped on the terror.

01:33:50.630 --> 01:33:52.674
"Lord Buckley said that.

01:33:54.426 --> 01:33:58.344
"It's hard to say he got
what he deserved...

01:33:59.431 --> 01:34:02.453
"because he never really got anything."

01:34:10.673 --> 01:34:13.220
"At least, not in this story,

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:16.973
"and right now this story
is all we have."

01:34:24.623 --> 01:34:27.747
Come on, Bronco, we're celebrating.

01:34:30.504 --> 01:34:34.802
Come on, the story is finished, man,
don't get weird on me now.

01:34:42.557 --> 01:34:44.584
To better days, huh?

01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:00.916
A close second, Bronco.

01:35:06.665 --> 01:35:08.496
"It's sad.

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.404
"But what's really sad is...

01:35:12.504 --> 01:35:14.964
"it never got weird enough for me.

01:35:16.633 --> 01:35:20.495
"I moved to the country
when the boat got too crowded.

01:35:20.595 --> 01:35:23.331
"Then I learned that President Nixon

01:35:23.432 --> 01:35:28.461
"had been eaten by white cannibals
on an island near Tijuana

01:35:28.562 --> 01:35:30.605
"for no good reason at all.

01:35:31.606 --> 01:35:37.613
"Golly, you hear a lot of savage and
unnatural things about people these days.

01:35:39.406 --> 01:35:44.368
"And Lazlo and Nixon are both gone now.

01:35:46.163 --> 01:35:49.941
"But I don't think I'm going
to believe that

01:35:50.042 --> 01:35:54.707
"until I can gnaw on both of their skulls
with my very own teeth."

01:35:55.839 --> 01:35:57.883
Fuck those people, huh?

01:35:59.134 --> 01:36:02.537
"If they're out there,
I'm going to find them

01:36:02.637 --> 01:36:05.429
"and I'm going to gnaw
on their skulls...

01:36:07.184 --> 01:36:10.972
"because it still hasn't gotten
weird enough for me."
