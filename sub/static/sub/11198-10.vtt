00:14.200 --> 00:16.840
All right, hold it! Right there!

00:22.400 --> 00:24.320
Hi.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.720
I am Ryk'l, Goa'uld Moloc.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.520
Shal kek nem Ron.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.160
I too will die for you, brother.

00:33.560 --> 00:38.800
Teal'c of the Tauri, your legend
precedes you. Thank you for meeting me.

00:38.880 --> 00:44.000
We were told that there are a great many
here who believe in freedom for all Jaffa.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.720
Go, go!

01:16.400 --> 01:18.400
More rebel Jaffa?

01:18.480 --> 01:21.480
There is only one way to be certain.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.800
Shal kek nem Ron!

01:27.560 --> 01:29.920
Shal kek nem Ron!

01:44.840 --> 01:48.160
Warriors of the Tauri...
we mean you no harm.

01:59.440 --> 02:02.400
Please, come with us.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.200
Shal krek tel kree.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.600
The Stargate will not be accessible
for long. We must hurry.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.840
<i>(squeaking)</i>

03:33.960 --> 03:37.080
- What's she doing?
- There is no time to explain. Come.

03:37.160 --> 03:39.000
- Kel, ma lek.
- Cree, shak nel.

03:39.080 --> 03:43.880
- They are outsiders.
- They are SG-1 of the Tauri.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.800
Hey, what's going on?

03:46.880 --> 03:49.480
This one believes
we should return to our planet.

03:49.560 --> 03:53.040
That one does not believe
it would be wise.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.840
Please. We knew you'd be here.

03:58.680 --> 03:59.480
How?

03:59.560 --> 04:03.560
Our intelligence network runs deep
within the Jaffa of Moloc.

04:03.640 --> 04:06.240
We came to ask for help.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.240
I promise you will be safe.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.640
Well, they did save us.

04:37.920 --> 04:40.080
Welcome to Hak'tyl.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.840
- Independence?
- Liberation.

04:43.920 --> 04:47.680
- Our dwellings are this way.
- We really should call home first.

04:47.760 --> 04:51.000
Let the folks know where we are.
It's past our curfew.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.320
By all means.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.600
- Why have we brought them here?
- That was our mission.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.880
- Why was I not told?
- We knew you would disagree.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.960
Go ahead, tell Ishta of our success.

05:18.480 --> 05:21.160
<i>(Jackson) So, Teal'c, who are they?</i>

05:21.240 --> 05:24.120
My knowledge of
the Goa'uld Moloc is limited.

05:24.200 --> 05:28.640
However, I am unaware of any Goa'uld
that permits women Jaffa to be warriors.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.720
They seem to be well trained.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.360
All females receive training.

05:34.320 --> 05:38.280
They have to defend their home world
when their men are called to battle.

05:38.360 --> 05:41.040
Can't help but think of
the Greek Amazon mythos.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.120
Yes, me too(!)

05:43.200 --> 05:48.520
Female warriors captured men from
other tribes in order to mate with them.

05:48.600 --> 05:53.920
They sometimes removed their right
breasts in order to fire a bow and arrow.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.280
I see neither bow nor arrow.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.120
No.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.600
Wait. You don't suppose
that's why they want us, do you?

06:02.680 --> 06:05.280
I mean, you know, the three of us.

06:05.360 --> 06:08.360
To mate with?
No. No, I don't think so.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.680
Cos you know me.
I'm all for helping people.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.760
<i>(Carter) Oh, God!</i>

06:29.520 --> 06:34.640
Forgive them. For many of the young,
this is the first time they have seen men.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.760
This is Ishta, our leader.

06:45.920 --> 06:48.720
<i>(O'Neill) Howdy, ma'am.
It's nice to meet you.</i>

06:48.800 --> 06:53.880
I've heard so...
Actually, I've heard nothing about... you.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.120
Teal'c, of Chulak.

06:57.200 --> 07:01.920
Former first prime of Apophis.
Shol'va, and who has become a legend.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.400
That's a bit thick, don't you think?

07:06.320 --> 07:11.200
I am no legend. I fight as any true-hearted
Jaffa for the freedom that we deserve.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.840
This is Daniel Jackson,
Major Carter and Colonel O'Neill.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.560
Hello.

07:24.400 --> 07:28.000
I have asked you here
so that I may propose an alliance.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.480
That's a fine idea.
We should sit, talk, nosh.

07:31.560 --> 07:35.880
No alliance can form between us and
those who steal symbiotes from a brother.

07:35.960 --> 07:39.880
He was no brother of mine.
Just a murderer of innocent children.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.000
Shal kree!

07:44.560 --> 07:46.640
There is much to discuss.

07:50.840 --> 07:52.840
This is Syn'ac.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.640
This morning she laid on her deathbed.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.000
She reached the age of Prata
three days ago.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.400
- Hm?
- Puberty.

08:04.480 --> 08:05.760
Ah.

08:05.840 --> 08:10.600
Without the symbiote we procured
this morning, she would be dead now.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.240
This is Nesa.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.320
Younger sister to Neith.

08:20.440 --> 08:25.040
She is next to reach the age.
Without a symbiote, she will die.

08:33.559 --> 08:36.080
As will all of our children.

08:42.840 --> 08:48.400
30 years ago Moloc decreed that only
male children would be allowed to live.

08:48.480 --> 08:52.480
Only they could strengthen his armies
and lead him to victory.

08:52.560 --> 08:56.040
Aside from the obvious immorality,
that doesn't make sense.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.480
How do you sustain a population
of any gender without women?

08:59.560 --> 09:01.920
The Jaffa life span is longer than humans'.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.360
This could go on for a hundred years.

09:04.440 --> 09:09.800
Any female child has to be sacrificed
in a ceremony of fire after they are born.

09:09.880 --> 09:12.560
- They're burned to death?
- Yes.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.760
Well, this is... odd.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.520
Maybe they feel more comfortable
talking to Sam.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.080
Why? Because we have penises?

09:28.520 --> 09:31.080
- Power bar?
- Yeah, thanks.

09:35.120 --> 09:37.240
So how did you start bringing them here?

09:37.320 --> 09:41.520
As a temple high priestess, part of
my duty is to keep record of births

09:41.600 --> 09:44.800
and to preside over
the ceremony of fire itself.

09:44.880 --> 09:49.880
I could not sit back and watch my sisters
be murdered and do nothing.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.160
As high priestess, I, along with
my seconds Mala and Neith,

09:53.240 --> 09:57.440
are allowed access to the Chaapa-ai
of the worlds under Moloc's rule.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.680
No one outside this camp
knows you do this?

09:59.760 --> 10:04.640
No. Our duties require us to attend to
missionary matters on various planets.

10:04.720 --> 10:08.160
So you offer the parents a chance
for their daughters to live.

10:08.240 --> 10:12.520
All but a few Jaffa under Moloc
worship him religiously.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.720
Not even the parents can be trusted.

10:15.800 --> 10:20.600
Children have to be spirited away, for fear
we'd be reported to the Imperial Guard.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.800
It is punishable by death
to even question the laws of a god.

10:23.880 --> 10:27.360
We have succeeded in saving many
from their birthright of death.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.080
So you want our help
to overthrow Moloc?

10:33.200 --> 10:36.840
- We may have underestimated you.
- We've gone after Goa'ulds before.

10:36.920 --> 10:40.160
Moloc is very powerful.
His armies are vast.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.440
We have our ways.
And some very powerful allies.

10:45.160 --> 10:48.440
Our immediate goals
are somewhat less ambitious.

10:48.520 --> 10:52.680
It is a struggle to procure the symbiotes
needed for our young to survive.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.240
We've lost many warriors in these raids.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.800
It has been said your weapons
are formidable.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.280
We also require sustenance.

11:01.360 --> 11:04.320
Supplies among our growing population
are scarce.

11:04.400 --> 11:10.160
We are proud warriors. We offer you
our services, and our knowledge in return.

11:10.240 --> 11:14.080
We have an extensive intelligence
network among the Jaffa under Moloc.

11:14.160 --> 11:17.600
What if I were to offer you an alternative?

11:17.680 --> 11:22.280
- An alternative to what?
- To your reliance on the Goa'uld.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.800
Tretonin?

11:30.880 --> 11:34.560
- We've had success with it so far.
- On all two test subjects.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.240
It hasn't been easy. The Jaffa
won't give up their symbiotes,

11:38.320 --> 11:42.200
- despite the fact it could free them.
- They believe they would be weaker.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.520
Centuries of Goa'uld brainwashing.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.480
- Will these women do it?
- They're thinking about it.

11:47.560 --> 11:51.680
They've suffered atrocities
at the hands of the Jaffa who serve Moloc.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.600
They don't have a problem killing
a few to survive.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.560
A Jaffa is taught
it is more noble to die than to kill.

11:57.640 --> 12:01.480
These children have been genetically
altered to depend on symbiotes,

12:01.560 --> 12:04.400
then had all access to them taken away.

12:04.480 --> 12:08.800
Their guardians believe this is
the only way for them to survive.

12:08.880 --> 12:12.200
Then they will have to see
that there is another way.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.680
Give 'em the old Teal'c charm!

12:42.480 --> 12:44.480
<i>(Ishta) It means courage.</i>

12:46.880 --> 12:52.040
Each design represents an ideal
that no warrior should ever forget.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.760
Impressive that I did not
sense your approach.

12:55.840 --> 13:00.560
Is not stealthiness one of the first talents
taught to a Jaffa soldier?

13:00.640 --> 13:03.520
With varying degrees of success.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.880
You wish to talk me into
succumbing to this experiment?

13:06.960 --> 13:08.800
Indeed.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.640
Come.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.720
Walk with me.

13:18.640 --> 13:23.920
Have you really the belief that
this Tretonin is our way to freedom?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.960
If it is successful,
it may be the first step.

13:27.040 --> 13:32.280
For, as long as Jaffa require symbiotes,
we will be enslaved by the Goa'uld.

13:32.360 --> 13:36.880
The benefit a symbiote provides
is not a Jaffa's true strength.

13:36.960 --> 13:40.280
We as a people must realise
that sacrifices must be made

13:40.360 --> 13:42.840
if we are to ever truly be free.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.800
This is where I come to kelno'reem.

14:03.360 --> 14:08.200
Much of our way of life has been designed
to instil our dependence on the Goa'uld.

14:08.280 --> 14:12.480
You believe it is wrong that we kill Jaffa
that our children would live.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.280
But what is war for
but to preserve our children?

14:15.360 --> 14:18.320
We do not engage
the defenceless or the weak.

14:18.400 --> 14:22.280
We always fight with honour,
and those that die do not die in vain.

14:22.360 --> 14:26.720
One day you will meet a Jaffa scout party
that will not so easily be ambushed.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.120
Then you doubt our abilities.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.640
Is that what this is about?

14:31.720 --> 14:34.600
You speak of progress
and shedding of the old ways,

14:34.680 --> 14:38.280
and yet you still think
a woman needs your protection.

14:46.240 --> 14:49.360
May your limbs be more nimble
than your tongue.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.720
For your sake.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.360
Urgh!

15:21.400 --> 15:24.360
Do not hold back.
You will only anger me further!

15:48.120 --> 15:52.440
You have proven yourself
a worthy adversary. Now hear me!

15:52.520 --> 15:56.920
If you say no to Tretonin, you have
an unquenchable thirst for bloodshed,

15:57.000 --> 16:01.320
and that does not serve
those who follow your leadership.

16:02.400 --> 16:07.680
- I sense no symbiote in you.
- You are correct.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.920
You take this drug yourself,
and yet you conceal it?

16:14.000 --> 16:16.520
Your actions betray your words. All right.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.760
That one means pride.

16:37.680 --> 16:41.200
No longer will we need
to lose our sisters in battle.

16:41.280 --> 16:45.280
No longer will our daughters
be dependent on symbiotes.

16:46.960 --> 16:50.000
Teal'c... has taken the drug.

16:50.080 --> 16:53.440
He stands here before you as evidence.

16:53.840 --> 16:59.800
I am asking for four volunteers
to travel with me to the Tauri,

17:00.320 --> 17:02.840
to test its effectiveness.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.560
Was that a pin dropping?

17:10.640 --> 17:15.119
- You must not go.
- Mala, I have made my decision.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.200
Hak'tyl needs you.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.480
You are our leader.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.640
I will go in your stead.

17:21.720 --> 17:24.240
It is my right as Kin'dra.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.119
You cannot say no.

17:32.440 --> 17:35.720
- You are brave and true.
- I too will go.

17:59.800 --> 18:03.880
- Nesa is of the age.
- She is a child.

18:03.960 --> 18:06.600
I am told that it's not without risk.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.400
- But if there is one among us...
- Never!

18:09.480 --> 18:12.520
That you even consider this
is an affront to all of us.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.640
Your words are disrespectful.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.520
I cannot force her hand.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.280
I wish you well.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.520
Dr Jackson? Teal'c?

18:52.600 --> 18:57.960
As Teal'c would say, undomesticated
equines couldn't drag him away.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.600
The Hak'tyl wanted to learn
about the rebel Jaffa.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.920
We can send updates on the progress of
the Tretonin treatment through the MALP.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.320
Kind of a PR thing, sir.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.240
I'm General Hammond. Welcome to Earth.

19:19.040 --> 19:22.400
When you rose up against Apophis,

19:22.480 --> 19:25.640
did you leave behind
someone that you loved?

19:25.720 --> 19:28.320
My son and I have been reunited.

19:28.400 --> 19:33.760
He has become a great warrior, travelling
with my mentor Bra'tac, spreading word.

19:33.840 --> 19:39.520
And what of his mother? Does she sit
at home, pining away for her hero?

19:42.160 --> 19:44.160
No, she is dead.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I am sorry, Teal'c.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.160
You could not have known.

19:50.120 --> 19:54.760
She died when her symbiote matured
and was unable to procure another.

19:54.840 --> 19:56.240
I see.

19:59.280 --> 20:02.640
- What of my symbiote?
- It's being sustained.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.640
We have methods of keeping
a symbiote alive for some time.

20:05.720 --> 20:11.120
As far as the Tretonin, finding the right
amount is going to be trial and error.

20:11.200 --> 20:15.960
We'll keep increasing the dose
until we get the desired effect.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.720
You're very brave.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.840
Not so much as you think.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.640
The rebellion that I have helped fuel

20:32.720 --> 20:37.320
has caused the Goa'uld
to mistrust the Jaffa with their young.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.520
You are making a point?

20:39.600 --> 20:42.240
I am speaking only of Drey'auc.

20:42.320 --> 20:45.920
She refused to take the life of another
Jaffa, even to preserve her own.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.520
No matter what their beliefs
may have been.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.960
What are your memories of her?

20:54.040 --> 20:57.160
She could be as fierce as the wind...

20:57.240 --> 20:59.240
or as gentle as the sunshine.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.840
And she never feared to be either.

21:03.520 --> 21:06.160
You still love her.

21:06.240 --> 21:09.080
I will always have a place
in my heart for her.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.080
You are close to Colonel O'Neill.

21:12.160 --> 21:15.360
Yeah. I like to think we have
a special relationship.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.240
I hope to someday have
a special relationship.

21:18.320 --> 21:21.240
Oh! No. No, it's not like that.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.080
Like what?

21:23.160 --> 21:25.840
We aren't... I mean, we don't...

21:25.920 --> 21:29.120
I was speaking of
the mutual respect you share.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.360
I knew that.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.000
I am from a world unlike yours, Teal'c.

21:36.080 --> 21:39.440
Where women aren't held
in such high regard.

21:40.400 --> 21:46.000
My husband was a warrior of high station
in Moloc's Imperial Guard.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.200
I was but one wife of many.

21:48.280 --> 21:50.360
Still, as temple priestess,

21:50.440 --> 21:54.800
I was afforded many luxuries
to make up for my mistreatment.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.200
What has become of your husband?

21:57.280 --> 22:00.760
He was killed in battle,
against a rival Goa'uld.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.560
I was once a temple handmaiden.

22:03.960 --> 22:07.360
I fell in love with a young palace guard.

22:07.440 --> 22:11.440
Our relationship was forbidden
because of our station.

22:11.520 --> 22:15.560
When it was discovered
that I was to have his child,

22:15.640 --> 22:18.720
Moloc sentenced my beloved to death

22:18.800 --> 22:21.280
and sacrificed our daughter
before my eyes.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.480
I'm so sorry.

22:25.560 --> 22:30.360
When will the Goa'uld thirst
for conquest and bloodshed end?

22:32.760 --> 22:34.760
When they are all dead.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.320
Are you OK?

22:44.400 --> 22:47.840
- My sister says I shouldn't talk to you.
- You don't have to.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.400
I'll just sit here for a while.

23:00.240 --> 23:02.240
I'm Daniel.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.760
I wasn't talking to you.

23:06.840 --> 23:10.040
- Who were you talking to then?
- No one.

23:13.360 --> 23:15.360
So how are you?

23:17.560 --> 23:19.600
I feel tired.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.360
- Who are you talking to?
- No one.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.440
What are those on your face?

23:28.520 --> 23:32.560
They're called glasses.
They help me see better.

23:32.640 --> 23:37.720
- Why would you need to see better?
- Cos my eyes don't see too well.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.360
- How do they work?
- Here.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.480
These make your sight worse.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.920
Yeah, well, they work differently
for different people.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.800
Perhaps you are in need of a symbiote.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.640
Yeah, I'll just stick with the glasses.

23:58.640 --> 24:03.240
Neith told me your people do not approve
of our use of symbiotes for healing.

24:03.320 --> 24:07.160
It's more complicated than that.
I just think there's a better way.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.280
Neith does not want me to participate
in your experiments.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.360
I know.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.920
Soon I will require a symbiote.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.760
You don't sound very happy about that.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.400
I will become a great warrior like Neith.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.480
You know, you can do that
without a symbiote.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.600
I can?

24:31.680 --> 24:33.160
Mm-hm.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.440
But, uh...

24:35.520 --> 24:38.000
you didn't hear that from me.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.320
Have you nothing to say?

25:01.720 --> 25:05.800
I have spoken more in two days
than I have in many years.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.120
And so you are done?

25:13.360 --> 25:15.960
Perhaps I should take my leave.

25:19.080 --> 25:22.320
Thoughts of your wife still linger.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.480
That's understandable.

25:25.800 --> 25:29.040
But she's been gone now for over a year.

25:29.120 --> 25:33.440
There is no sin in taking comfort
in another lonely soul...

25:33.520 --> 25:35.640
if you wish.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.360
Mala's the only one not responding.

25:57.440 --> 26:01.920
Her white blood cell count is way down.
If this keeps up, she'll go into sepsis.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.960
- What can you do?
- Continue to increase the Tretonin levels.

26:06.040 --> 26:10.120
But she's already at double the dose
that's working in the others.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.440
I want to move her to lsolation.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.440
We had no guarantees, going in.

26:17.520 --> 26:21.360
Some would say an 80 per cent
success rate isn't bad in a trial like this.

26:21.440 --> 26:23.560
Not in the minds of the Jaffa.

26:23.640 --> 26:25.560
We're not done yet.

26:25.640 --> 26:29.520
We haven't begun to explore the reasons
why it might not be working.

26:29.600 --> 26:32.080
- We need this to work.
- I know.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.000
- Morning.
- You had no right to speak to her!

27:08.080 --> 27:10.320
- Sorry.
- I saved her from her birthright.

27:10.400 --> 27:14.160
And it will be the symbiote I procure
that will save her once again.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.880
I have lost two sisters,
and I will not lose another!

27:16.960 --> 27:18.920
OK. OK.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.280
You lost two sisters. I'm sorry.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.920
Ishta was able to save me.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.280
But she couldn't save
the next two girls sired by my father.

27:27.360 --> 27:31.160
He was a Jaffa stationed
high in the Imperial Guard.

27:31.240 --> 27:36.120
I swore that when I came of age
no more of my sisters would die.

27:37.080 --> 27:42.480
When I heard my mother had given birth
to another female, I knew what I had to do.

27:42.920 --> 27:45.120
You should be proud of that.

27:45.200 --> 27:50.440
My father discovered the ruse Ishta and I
used to keep Nesa away from the fire.

27:50.520 --> 27:53.440
I had to kill him... so we could escape.

27:54.720 --> 27:58.760
Well, don't you want to give Nesa
a chance to live free of the Goa'uld?

27:59.840 --> 28:02.200
Not your way.

28:20.920 --> 28:25.880
You have moved me away from the others
because you didn't wish to frighten them.

28:25.960 --> 28:28.520
The truth is, you're not doing so well.

28:28.600 --> 28:31.360
You're more susceptible to infection.

28:31.440 --> 28:34.280
How are the others responding
to treatment?

28:34.360 --> 28:36.520
Good. Very good.

28:36.600 --> 28:39.040
<i>(beeping of machines quickens)</i>

28:39.120 --> 28:40.480
Janet?

28:43.600 --> 28:46.360
<i>- (Mala groans)
- Her BP is 60/40.</i>

28:46.440 --> 28:48.320
Give her a bolus.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.120
<i>(gasping)</i>

28:51.600 --> 28:54.120
We have to put her symbiote back.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.840
- Do not.
- If we don't, you could die.

28:56.920 --> 29:00.640
This must work
if my people are to be free.

29:01.720 --> 29:06.480
If I continue to be enslaved
by the Goa'uld I carried,

29:06.560 --> 29:09.000
I am as good as dead.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.240
<i>(breathing heavily)</i>

29:12.080 --> 29:13.920
Please.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.880
You challenge Ishta?

29:29.960 --> 29:32.160
She is no longer fit to lead us.

29:32.240 --> 29:35.320
She consorts with Teal'c.
Her judgment has been clouded.

29:35.400 --> 29:39.920
Our sisters risked their lives for
the experiment. Do you see no benefit?

29:40.000 --> 29:44.080
Even if the Tretonin works, it merely
places our dependence on the humans...

29:44.160 --> 29:46.800
Whom you also do not trust.

29:46.880 --> 29:50.320
Who is to say their intentions are pure?

29:50.400 --> 29:54.560
Their leaders are men. They wish to
sap our strength with this drug.

29:54.640 --> 29:59.000
We are safe here now, but if Moloc learnt
we were behind the raids on his Jaffa...

29:59.080 --> 30:03.240
Our freedom lies in dominance
over the Goa'uld.

30:03.320 --> 30:06.800
We must fight, so that we may use
their symbiotes to our advantage.

30:06.880 --> 30:10.160
Only then will we control our own destiny.

30:11.640 --> 30:14.000
I wish to know,

30:14.080 --> 30:18.520
if I am to challenge Ishta's leadership,
who will follow me?

30:19.880 --> 30:21.880
Neith!

30:24.240 --> 30:27.120
You must come quick.
It is Nesa.

30:28.040 --> 30:31.240
<i>(Fraiser) I'm not waiting any longer.</i>

30:38.640 --> 30:40.640
<i>(squeaking)</i>

30:50.920 --> 30:53.520
How long before
we see some improvement?

30:53.600 --> 30:55.240
Not long, I hope.

30:58.440 --> 31:01.080
She's coding. Assert CPR.

31:01.160 --> 31:04.080
Give me one milligram epi. Prep for defib.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.160
Be strong, sister.

31:15.080 --> 31:17.080
I will not fail you.

31:27.280 --> 31:31.320
- What is happening?
- Neith has claimed Joma Secu!

31:31.400 --> 31:33.640
Daniel. Teal'c.
This is Sam. Come in.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.000
<i>Daniel. Teal'c.
This is Sam. Come in.</i>

31:38.080 --> 31:41.120
<i>- Go ahead, Sam. It's Daniel.
- We have some bad news.</i>

31:41.200 --> 31:43.760
Things aren't going well here either.
What's up?

31:44.800 --> 31:46.240
It's Mala.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.960
<i>(Teal'c) Ishta!</i>

31:55.200 --> 31:58.160
- Ishta!
- You dare interfere!

31:58.240 --> 32:00.360
She challenged me. It is my right.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.480
It is your right to grant mercy.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.560
<i>(Jackson) Excuse me!</i>

32:08.160 --> 32:11.120
Look, I know this is
not a good time for this...

32:11.200 --> 32:13.360
Speak!

32:13.440 --> 32:16.000
Mala's dead.

32:16.080 --> 32:18.120
What?

32:20.680 --> 32:23.200
I'm sorry.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.320
How?

32:25.400 --> 32:27.800
The Tretonin wasn't working.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.080
They tried to reintroduce her symbiote...

32:31.160 --> 32:33.720
I just want you to know
the other women are fine.

32:33.800 --> 32:37.040
See what your weakness has brought?

32:37.120 --> 32:39.600
Nesa is in need of a symbiote!

32:44.040 --> 32:46.080
She shall have one.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.200
Do not make this mistake.
Moloc will not allow this to continue.

32:56.280 --> 32:59.480
- You give me no choice.
- How many warriors have to die?

32:59.560 --> 33:04.840
Our sisters in your care will be returned
safely, or the two of you will be sacrificed.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.320
Kree, sha Mel lak!

33:28.560 --> 33:33.440
I know you wanna stop them, but even if
we got out, we don't know where they are.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.280
Come with me.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.760
She insisted.

34:02.840 --> 34:07.480
I do not wish for someone else to die
so that I might live.

34:07.560 --> 34:10.159
I do not want to take a symbiote.

34:15.239 --> 34:18.480
<i>(clears throat) Did you talk to your sister?</i>

34:19.480 --> 34:21.480
She would not listen.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.320
It is my right to decide, is it not?

34:26.120 --> 34:28.120
I'm not sure.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.360
It should be.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.639
What happened to Mala?

34:34.719 --> 34:37.800
We don't know. It was partly
a reaction to her own symbiote.

34:37.880 --> 34:41.000
It shouldn't happen to someone
who was never implanted.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.960
And the Tretonin worked in others,
did it not?

34:44.040 --> 34:45.800
Yes.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.920
I wish to try it.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.280
OK.

34:57.360 --> 35:00.240
Do you know where
Ishta and Neith have gone?

35:01.680 --> 35:03.480
No.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.920
I do.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.000
Sel ma-ka nee!

35:26.320 --> 35:30.840
We have been fortunate here this day.
More have died than needed to.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.800
We have saved the life of my sister.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.840
Shal...

35:49.920 --> 35:52.000
kek nem Ron.

35:54.800 --> 35:57.680
Is the symbiote too near maturity?

36:02.920 --> 36:05.800
- What is wrong?
- This Jaffa...

36:05.880 --> 36:08.000
has the same wish for freedom as do we.

36:08.080 --> 36:11.280
Then he should not have fought with
those that follow Moloc.

36:11.360 --> 36:15.840
How many others... that might have been
our allies have we killed this day?

36:15.920 --> 36:18.120
I'll do it myself.

36:22.760 --> 36:23.800
No!

36:31.960 --> 36:35.240
- Are you OK?
- She's severely wounded.

36:35.320 --> 36:38.000
Her symbiote is damaged as well.

36:38.960 --> 36:41.520
Ishta, you have a choice.

37:00.920 --> 37:03.520
I don't know how much longer
I can keep her alive.

37:03.600 --> 37:08.400
If I'm going to administer the Tretonin,
it's now or never.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.880
You must speak to her.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.600
Neith.

37:35.040 --> 37:37.040
Your symbiote is dying.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.000
You must procure another.

37:43.960 --> 37:47.240
No. Those ways are over.

37:47.320 --> 37:51.640
- You sentence me to death.
- I ask you to choose life.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.560
She will not listen to me.

38:06.960 --> 38:09.840
Well, maybe she'll listen to her sister.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.320
Please, Neith.

38:19.920 --> 38:24.040
- You betrayed me.
- No, you betray me.

38:24.840 --> 38:29.520
Since before I can remember, you have
taught me to believe in our freedom.

38:29.600 --> 38:34.120
You said you would do anything
so that you might protect me.

38:34.200 --> 38:38.000
One day I will be a great warrior like you.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.880
But I am not yet.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.400
I still need you.

38:47.520 --> 38:49.720
I have chosen to live free.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.480
You must choose to take the Tretonin

38:53.560 --> 38:57.360
if you are to continue
to teach and protect me.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.280
Please.

39:02.680 --> 39:04.760
I do not wish you to die.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.120
- Will you come and visit?
- Yes, of course.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.880
My sister's developed
quite an affection for you.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.960
<i>(whispers) Neith!</i>

39:46.840 --> 39:49.200
We are grateful to our new friends.

39:49.280 --> 39:53.440
On behalf of the Hak'tyl,
I'd like to express our thanks.

39:53.520 --> 39:56.120
Our medical team
will be checking in regularly.

39:56.200 --> 39:59.840
Take note of any symptoms that could be
side effects of the Tretonin.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.360
You trained us well
in the use of the medicine.

40:02.440 --> 40:05.000
And the supplies
you have provided will go far.

40:05.080 --> 40:10.640
If there's anything else you need -
anything - call us. Send us an email.

40:10.720 --> 40:14.560
Just let not so many moons go by
before we see you again.

40:14.640 --> 40:17.680
Don't worry, I'm sure we'll be in...

40:21.640 --> 40:23.640
touch.
