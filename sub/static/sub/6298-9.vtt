<i>MATTAI:</i>
<i>The entire Turkish navy</i>

00:11.172 --> 00:13.440

do you have to bring us?

00:15.276 --> 00:16.276

00:16.344 --> 00:17.811
All roads lead to Rome

00:19.447 --> 00:21.515
Our men, united
under a common banner

00:21.583 --> 00:24.418

<i>I have my child, my husband.</i>

00:26.621 --> 00:28.922

Everything?

00:28.990 --> 00:30.791
Almost everything.

doing here?

00:34.996 --> 00:36.263
<i>RUFIO:</i>
<i>It's code.</i>

00:36.297 --> 00:38.265
"We must know when they
will move on Forli."

00:38.299 --> 00:39.600
Who did you
copy this from?

00:39.667 --> 00:41.268
The boy I took to my bed.

00:41.302 --> 00:42.636
LUCREZIA:
Your Highness,

00:42.670 --> 00:44.238
how would you define
my ambassadorial duties?

00:44.305 --> 00:46.473
You must keep me informed
of your brother's designs.

00:46.508 --> 00:48.275
You're a prisoner, my dear,
plain and simple.

00:48.343 --> 00:49.843
Who are we to trust?

00:49.878 --> 00:51.812
You can trust me, Father.
Oh!

00:51.846 --> 00:53.647
You have no alternative.

00:53.715 --> 00:55.115
King Frederigo of Naples

00:55.183 --> 00:56.917
is in league with
Catherina Sforza.

00:56.985 --> 01:00.053
She will be kept hostage
the moment we attack Forli!

01:00.155 --> 01:01.722
And why am I a prisoner?

01:01.789 --> 01:04.191
Because you chose
the wrong brother.

01:05.393 --> 01:07.060
<i>CESARE:</i>
<i>The spy -</i>

01:07.162 --> 01:08.829
Kill him.

<i>LUCREZIA: How do I leave?</i>
<i>You could make them sleep.</i>

01:10.365 --> 01:13.167
I put a whole village
to sleep once with this.

01:13.234 --> 01:15.202
Why? Why did you
become my lover?

01:15.236 --> 01:16.870
Why?
Because I was made an offer!

01:16.905 --> 01:19.907
You tell me how you
wish to die, Pascal.

06:09.697 --> 06:11.631
she knows how to celebrate.
Hear, hear.

06:11.666 --> 06:14.000
So you approve
of my little display.

they will not partake?

06:35.256 --> 06:37.824
Your protectors.
Ah!

06:37.892 --> 06:39.693
No, they must
stay ever alert.

06:39.727 --> 06:42.195
For the slightest hint
of danger to your persons.

06:42.229 --> 06:43.863

Ha!

09:14.682 --> 09:16.983
Micheletto doesn't flee.
He has, my lord.

09:17.051 --> 09:19.385
There's no sign of him.

09:28.896 --> 09:31.131
So you say you've
been searching?

09:31.165 --> 09:32.565
BAGLIONI:
Since the morning.

09:32.633 --> 09:34.400
He has vanished
without trace.

09:34.468 --> 09:36.002
Then you'll
find no trace.

09:37.538 --> 09:39.372
Unless he wants you to.

10:20.748 --> 10:23.183
His only code
was loyalty.

10:46.207 --> 10:48.408
Can one of you
replace him?

10:48.475 --> 10:49.943
My lord...

10:51.245 --> 10:53.746
Don't even try
to answer that.

11:16.003 --> 11:18.137
The grave awaits
us all, Vanozza.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.442
We would have our
family rest together.

11:22.476 --> 11:24.677
Is there room
in there for me?

11:24.778 --> 11:26.946
For you?

11:26.981 --> 11:29.349
A nook, perhaps.
[laughs]

11:31.652 --> 11:34.087
Have you spoken
to our eldest son?

11:34.154 --> 11:35.822
Hardly.

11:35.890 --> 11:39.459
He comes and goes like
a ghost in the night.

11:39.493 --> 11:42.228
Well, if he has plans,
we would know of them.

11:42.263 --> 11:44.063
Do you think he
shares them with me?

11:44.131 --> 11:45.865
You are his mother.

11:45.933 --> 11:48.501
Cesare Borgia is well nigh unknowable.
Yeah, like the Sphinx.

11:48.569 --> 11:50.236
You know he has the
French King in his pocket

11:50.271 --> 11:51.938
and the French army
at his beck and call,

11:51.972 --> 11:54.173
and nobody knows what
he's going to do next.

11:54.241 --> 11:55.642
Have you tried
talking to him?

11:55.676 --> 11:57.510
We never see him
to talk to him.

11:57.578 --> 11:59.779
Have you tried
forgiving him?

11:59.813 --> 12:02.148
For what?
For whatever lies between you two?

12:02.182 --> 12:04.784
And what's that?
Well, only you two know.

12:05.786 --> 12:08.688
That's the trouble:
you're too alike.

12:08.789 --> 12:11.291
Mm.

12:38.352 --> 12:40.586
Micheletto.

12:40.621 --> 12:42.855
But you will need a hundred
times these men to take it.

12:42.957 --> 12:44.857
I don't want Naples yet.
I want my sister.

You were betrayed.

I was betrayed.
All of us.

13:28.702 --> 13:30.870
[breathing heavily]

13:31.005 --> 13:33.339
Never again.

Not everyone can
love like that.

MATTAI:
Yes, Holiness.

14:04.872 --> 14:07.907
What? The head of John
the Baptist, perhaps?

14:08.008 --> 14:10.676
No, Holiness.

14:10.711 --> 14:12.845
A relic of a more
recent drama.

14:12.913 --> 14:14.347
What?

14:14.381 --> 14:17.583
A relic of your crusade
against the Turkish navy.

14:17.618 --> 14:19.986
Ah.
Achieved in one fell swoop.

14:20.054 --> 14:26.592
So that Venetian ships can
ply the Adriatic once more.

14:26.693 --> 14:28.094
[sighs]

14:29.096 --> 14:31.030
You can charge them
for the privilege.

14:31.098 --> 14:32.298
Yeah.

14:32.399 --> 14:34.033
And forego your tithe

14:34.101 --> 14:35.902
on my Hebrew brethren.

14:38.705 --> 14:41.374
You worked your
stratagem with oil.

14:43.744 --> 14:47.513
Can you do the
same with sulphur?

14:47.548 --> 14:49.715
Sulphur?

14:49.783 --> 14:52.185
We would control...

14:53.620 --> 14:56.923
...the supply of
sulphur in this land.

14:57.024 --> 14:58.257
Sulphur and saltpeter

14:58.392 --> 14:59.826
make gunpowder.

14:59.893 --> 15:03.196
Yes. Now, any alchemist
can make saltpeter.

15:05.232 --> 15:08.968
But sulphur must be drawn
from the bowels of the earth.

15:12.539 --> 15:15.241
And there is only
one source.

15:15.309 --> 15:17.877
The Solfatara Caldara.
Mm.

15:17.911 --> 15:21.714
We would use the coin
you have saved us

15:21.748 --> 15:25.118
to buy up
the whole supply

15:25.152 --> 15:28.387
and deprive our
enemies of gunpowder.

15:30.624 --> 15:32.358
[chuckling]
Your enemies being...?

15:32.392 --> 15:33.659
Oh, it doesn't matter.

15:33.727 --> 15:36.462
Milan, the Sforzas,
Naples, France-

15:36.530 --> 15:40.900
whoever wants to wage war
will need our compliance.

15:40.934 --> 15:43.436
And how does this
help my people?

15:43.570 --> 15:44.904
Mm.

15:44.938 --> 15:46.706
There will come a time.

15:46.740 --> 15:49.542
Favours will be repaid.

15:49.610 --> 15:52.512
And you will be
our agent in this

15:52.579 --> 15:54.547
but nothing must
connect you to us.

15:54.581 --> 15:58.251
And you should present
yourself as a Christian.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.254
Holiness, I cannot.

16:01.288 --> 16:03.623
You will be trading
beyond Rome's protection.

16:03.657 --> 16:05.458
The laws of Abraham
forbid it.

16:05.492 --> 16:08.361
No, we ask you to present
yourself, not to convert.

16:08.395 --> 16:10.897
Get rid
of that...

16:10.964 --> 16:13.866
Hebrew...
garb,

16:13.901 --> 16:15.501
trim those locks.

16:15.569 --> 16:17.436
and pray to who
you will in private.

16:17.471 --> 16:22.074
But in public,
just show a little piety.

No.

16:41.261 --> 16:43.462
But I can pretend.

16:43.497 --> 16:46.766
I serve a Christian pope
so you can remain a Jew.

16:50.804 --> 16:54.140
And I may have a task
for our brethren.

You are charged with

17:41.121 --> 17:44.624

husband and her child.

17:44.658 --> 17:46.325
You will choose her staff:

17:46.360 --> 17:50.596
her cooks, her child's
nursemaid, her manservants.

17:50.631 --> 17:53.599
And I would know where she is,
where her husband is,

17:53.634 --> 17:56.435
at every hour of every day.

17:56.503 --> 17:58.704
Is that task enough for you?

17:58.772 --> 18:01.974
LUCREZIA: I'll
take him, Nurse. Ah!

18:02.042 --> 18:04.010
Sweet boy.

18:08.649 --> 18:13.052
He is home once more.
Does he remember-the Vatican?

18:14.154 --> 18:15.054
[baby babbling]

18:15.155 --> 18:16.889
Home.

18:16.990 --> 18:18.624
Home.

18:20.327 --> 18:22.395
It doesn't
feel like home.

18:22.496 --> 18:23.963
Are you lost, Sis?

18:23.997 --> 18:25.998
Perhaps.

18:26.033 --> 18:28.668
He will need a bigger cot.
Mm.

18:30.070 --> 18:32.238
As will he.

18:32.339 --> 18:34.040
[giggling]

18:39.313 --> 18:41.213
He made you smile.
[giggling] No, you did.

18:41.248 --> 18:42.381
I did?
How?

18:44.251 --> 18:48.354
Because you are
the joy of my life.

18:48.422 --> 18:50.456
The light of my days.

18:50.524 --> 18:52.692
You know that I know
that that isn't true.

19:03.937 --> 19:06.372
How long can
we last like this?

19:09.776 --> 19:12.411
How long does
marriage last?

19:16.950 --> 19:18.317
MATTAI: Tell me.
[workers coughing throughout]

19:18.385 --> 19:20.486
The income from this
pit in a month is...?

19:20.554 --> 19:21.987
OVERSEER: You must speak
to the proprietor.

19:22.055 --> 19:23.456
MATTAI:
Where is the proprietor?

19:23.523 --> 19:24.890
OVERSEER: There are many
scattered through the region.

19:24.958 --> 19:26.959
The families divide the spoils.

19:27.060 --> 19:29.195
MATTAI: Tell them I would
buy this year's supply.

19:29.262 --> 19:30.396
In total?

19:30.464 --> 19:31.731
Tell them I would buy

19:31.765 --> 19:33.032
every ounce of sulphur
this mine produces

19:33.066 --> 19:34.633
throughout this
coming year.

19:34.735 --> 19:36.402
And whatever else
lies in storage.

19:36.436 --> 19:38.771
You are contemplating
a war, sir?

19:38.805 --> 19:40.573
A war or a peace.
Does it matter?

19:40.607 --> 19:43.075
<i>[coughing continues]</i>

19:45.979 --> 19:47.646
This palace is yours.

19:47.714 --> 19:51.384
Signor Orsini will see
to your protection.

19:51.451 --> 19:52.885
Why here?

19:52.919 --> 19:54.820
You need premises
of your own.

19:54.921 --> 19:56.922
To avoid prying eyes.

19:56.957 --> 19:59.125
A place that is safe, protected.

19:59.159 --> 20:01.093
I will not have your
safety compromised.

20:01.161 --> 20:03.229
And my husband?

20:03.263 --> 20:05.664
What of him?

20:05.732 --> 20:07.333
If he were to ride
back to Naples?

20:07.434 --> 20:09.435
I will not allow it.

20:09.503 --> 20:12.004
If you cannot
prevent it?

20:12.105 --> 20:13.773
You know me, Sister.

20:13.807 --> 20:15.775
Certain things
I will not countenance.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.415
He could cause public
scandal, if he...

20:22.482 --> 20:25.418
If he what?

20:25.452 --> 20:28.287
Intimates any
impropriety between us.

20:31.658 --> 20:33.793
We are family;
we love each other.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.327
Hm?

20:35.362 --> 20:37.129
We are Spanish.
We embrace.

20:37.164 --> 20:38.898
Where is
the scandal?

20:38.965 --> 20:41.367
You know where
the scandal is.

20:51.778 --> 20:53.112
<i>MATTAI:</i>
<i>There's a warehouse</i>

20:53.146 --> 20:55.114

21:08.094 --> 21:11.530
We'll make a
Christian of you yet.

21:11.598 --> 21:13.766
Will my reward
be in your heaven?

21:13.834 --> 21:16.469
Hm.

21:16.570 --> 21:19.738
A Christian and an optimist.

21:19.873 --> 21:21.407
We like that.

21:24.444 --> 21:26.579
Nobody knows
of its location?

21:38.925 --> 21:42.228
And they will all blame each
other for the lack of powder.

21:42.262 --> 21:45.064
You wanted to sow confusion.

21:45.131 --> 21:46.632
[chuckles]

21:46.733 --> 21:49.101
You read us too well.

21:58.445 --> 22:00.079
GATEKEEPER:
Twenty-five silver.

22:00.146 --> 22:02.081
Is there gold
in those wagons?

22:02.115 --> 22:04.083
MATTAI:
What did I pay you for?

22:04.150 --> 22:05.451
Silence.

22:33.146 --> 22:35.614
[loud hissing]

22:35.649 --> 22:37.650
Gold that burns.

22:41.555 --> 22:43.889
Father,
Catherina.

22:43.990 --> 22:45.891
Hm?

22:45.992 --> 22:48.160
We must resolve this

22:48.228 --> 22:50.729
or it will be
resolved for us.

22:50.830 --> 22:52.464
How?
[sighs]

22:52.532 --> 22:54.099
She plots with Naples.

22:54.167 --> 22:55.634
She reinforces
her stronghold.

22:55.702 --> 22:58.003
She requisitions cannon.

22:58.038 --> 22:59.338
She will soon
be impregnable.

22:59.406 --> 23:00.873
Are you so sure?

23:01.007 --> 23:02.408
Yes!

23:02.509 --> 23:04.076
Yes, I'm certain,

23:04.144 --> 23:05.844
and I cannot
understand

23:05.912 --> 23:09.648
why you don't
share my certainty.

23:09.683 --> 23:12.017
Certainty is the
preserve of youth.

23:13.820 --> 23:16.255
So I still
have to wait.

23:18.725 --> 23:21.026
I know your coffers
are full.

23:21.061 --> 23:24.229
I know your Crusade
was an illusion.

23:24.264 --> 23:26.665
I know you are re-equipping
the papal armies,

23:26.733 --> 23:30.135
as you should.

23:30.203 --> 23:33.238
Can you give me permission
to survey them at least?

23:33.340 --> 23:36.342
Survey them, my son.

23:36.376 --> 23:41.080
See, are Rome's
defences secure.

23:41.181 --> 23:45.417
But as for
the Spider of Forli,

23:45.452 --> 23:47.786
I have reason to believe
she will wait.

23:52.325 --> 23:54.393

<i>The gates!</i>

24:20.620 --> 24:23.322
Florence will neither
help nor hinder us.

24:23.390 --> 24:24.657
And Machiavelli?

24:24.758 --> 24:27.426
Will do nothing.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.828
His nothing
is worth a lot.

24:29.929 --> 24:32.665
He will deny them passage
across Florentine lands.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.199
Good news.

24:34.267 --> 24:37.770
Now the bad: our
powder is almost out.

24:37.804 --> 24:40.239
Powder?
Gunpowder- for the cannon.

24:41.508 --> 24:43.442
Supplies of sulphur
have dried up.

24:43.476 --> 24:45.944
Some agency, some person,
has bought them wholesale.

24:46.079 --> 24:47.813
Cesare Borgia.

24:47.914 --> 24:49.148
Is he that clever?

24:49.249 --> 24:51.050
Let us hope not.

24:53.653 --> 24:56.121
Nurse, I need
an earthenware jug.

24:58.591 --> 24:59.925
Oh.

24:59.993 --> 25:02.094
Where is my maidservant?

25:02.162 --> 25:04.263
She's indisposed,
my lady.

25:05.432 --> 25:08.167
Who appointed you?
The master of the household.

25:08.234 --> 25:09.802
Who is master
of the household?

25:09.869 --> 25:13.439
SERVANT:
I am, my lady.

25:13.506 --> 25:15.774
And who appointed you?
My lady.

25:15.842 --> 25:17.276
Signor Orsini.

25:17.343 --> 25:18.577
[indistinct chatter]

25:18.678 --> 25:20.412
Ah.

25:25.151 --> 25:27.753

a ball of 300 pounds.

25:32.625 --> 25:35.761

25:38.298 --> 25:39.865
Admirable.

25:39.933 --> 25:41.800
But there
is a problem.

25:41.868 --> 25:43.702
Problem?

25:43.803 --> 25:45.938
The powder to
fire the ball.

25:45.972 --> 25:48.173
Gunpowder is made of
saltpeter and sulphur.

25:48.208 --> 25:50.242
Saltpeter we have
in plenty.

25:50.310 --> 25:52.077
But the supplies of
sulphur have dried up.

25:52.145 --> 25:54.847
How can they just dry up?

25:54.881 --> 25:56.148
Someone has been
buying the supplies

25:56.216 --> 25:58.183
from Solfatara Caldara.

25:58.218 --> 26:00.052
And that someone
has in their power

26:00.120 --> 26:01.754
a moratorium
on warfare.

26:01.821 --> 26:04.022
What a clever move.

26:04.124 --> 26:06.191
Catherina Sforza?

26:06.226 --> 26:08.660
Too clever
even for her.

26:11.197 --> 26:12.598
We need a spy
out there.

26:12.665 --> 26:16.135
Someone to smell
out sulphur.

26:16.202 --> 26:18.103
Prospero?

26:18.171 --> 26:20.339
I shall sniff it out,

27:43.957 --> 27:45.724
As I can see.

27:45.758 --> 27:47.359
But for what?
[sword fighting; men shouting]

27:47.427 --> 27:50.429
For whatever
His Holiness intends.

27:54.467 --> 27:56.935
Cesare Borgia.

27:57.003 --> 27:58.737
Alfonso.

27:58.805 --> 28:01.306
Finally we're on
first-name terms.

28:01.341 --> 28:03.175
Spar with me,
Brother.

28:03.276 --> 28:04.743
Brother-in-law.

28:04.811 --> 28:06.411
But you could love
me as a brother-

28:06.446 --> 28:08.847
if you ever loved
your brother.

28:08.948 --> 28:11.016
I did.

28:11.117 --> 28:13.085
Mightily.
So I've heard.

28:15.255 --> 28:17.689
Do not provoke me,
my lord.

28:17.757 --> 28:19.958
I said "spar."
Not "fight."

28:29.135 --> 28:30.369
You are good
with a blade.

28:30.470 --> 28:31.837
Are you surprised?

28:31.871 --> 28:34.473
But I would not harm that
which my sister loves.

28:34.540 --> 28:36.942
Does she love me?

28:37.010 --> 28:39.378
As she loves her brother?

28:39.445 --> 28:41.346
You're in bad humour,
my lord.

28:41.481 --> 28:42.648
Yes.

28:42.715 --> 28:44.483
Dangerously bad humour.

28:44.517 --> 28:48.420
This Vatican is a hive
of whispers, and rumours,

28:48.488 --> 28:52.424
and innuendos that set
my imagination to a fever.

28:52.492 --> 28:53.725
You should never
heed rumour.

28:53.826 --> 28:56.695
Oh, but you're the source
of them, my lord.

28:56.796 --> 28:58.063
And rumour has it

28:58.131 --> 28:59.972
that there are three in
this marriage, not two!

Shale.

Sell it where we can.

You would sell the

31:23.209 --> 31:24.876
Bless yourself then.

You have a master.
Who?

But does it matter?

31:48.234 --> 31:49.768
The point is,
those stores exist.

31:51.404 --> 31:53.705
I know where.

31:53.739 --> 31:55.407
We should capture
those stores,

33:07.647 --> 33:10.782
that will leave
none of us the same.

33:10.816 --> 33:13.385
I would leave now,
if I could,

33:13.486 --> 33:16.354
take my child, take you.

33:17.857 --> 33:19.958
And your husband?

33:20.026 --> 33:21.893
[sigh]

33:21.961 --> 33:24.563
Take him if he would come.
But I doubt it.

33:24.664 --> 33:26.498
Go home, Lucrezia.

33:26.566 --> 33:28.300
You brood too much.

33:32.538 --> 33:35.507
You see the wheel tracks?

33:35.575 --> 33:37.842
Follow the trail of yellow.

33:37.877 --> 33:40.545
If I ever get lost.
You're not lost.

33:40.646 --> 33:41.846
I am.

33:41.914 --> 33:45.050
In a maze of betrayal.

33:45.084 --> 33:48.853
He would betray you
in a heartbeat.

33:52.992 --> 33:59.497
[♪]

33:59.532 --> 34:01.466
BAGLIONI:
They leave it unguarded?

34:01.534 --> 34:05.237
COLONNA: A guard would draw
too much attention to it.

34:05.338 --> 34:08.940
Here. Look.

34:09.041 --> 34:10.875
A store of yellow.

34:13.446 --> 34:16.781
The colour of betrayal.

34:16.882 --> 34:19.050
Ah, Baglioni.
No.

34:19.085 --> 34:21.219
I am afraid,
my friend, yes.

34:25.224 --> 34:28.360
[panting]

34:28.427 --> 34:31.129
[grunting]

34:40.773 --> 34:43.074
My lord -
I found -

34:43.109 --> 34:46.143
Yes. You found powder
for which I thank you.

34:48.114 --> 34:49.914
Now show us around.

34:49.949 --> 34:51.882
Show us what you found.

35:02.061 --> 35:03.428
[door creaks]

35:04.930 --> 35:06.331
Chase him down!

35:13.105 --> 35:15.140
[panting]

35:21.280 --> 35:23.348
[grunting]

35:24.784 --> 35:26.918
[coughing]
You didn't quite betray me-

35:26.952 --> 35:28.687
Not yet my lord!

35:28.721 --> 35:30.455
Because I didn't
give you time enough.

35:30.489 --> 35:32.991
[coughing]
But with enough time,

35:33.025 --> 35:36.127
you would have burnt me in
that mound of sulphur. Huh?

35:36.162 --> 35:38.096
Is it true, Baglioni?
Too true, my lord.

35:39.131 --> 35:41.299
[grunting]

35:43.502 --> 35:44.969
Why, Baglioni, why?

35:45.104 --> 35:47.038
Because, my friend,
this is what we do.

35:48.107 --> 35:50.041
We are connoisseurs
of treachery.

35:50.142 --> 35:51.876
So can anyone tell me

35:51.977 --> 35:53.745
who owns this
pile of dust?

35:53.813 --> 35:55.480
ORSINI:
Catherina Sforza?

35:55.514 --> 35:57.349
CESARE: Why would
she store it in Rome?

35:59.285 --> 36:00.719
Who was it?

36:02.355 --> 36:05.156
King Frederigo
of Naples?

36:05.224 --> 36:08.360
Louis of France?

36:08.461 --> 36:10.729
Whoever gathered it here
did so for a purpose!

36:10.796 --> 36:12.664
<i>MATTAI:</i>
<i>I brought it here.</i>

36:14.500 --> 36:15.633
And you are?

36:15.668 --> 36:17.635
I am a humble
merchant.

36:17.670 --> 36:19.537
Who holds the power
of life and death,

36:19.638 --> 36:21.172
war and peace.

36:21.307 --> 36:23.007
I bought it for another.

36:24.577 --> 36:26.211
Take him outside.

36:26.245 --> 36:28.079
BAGLIONI:
And do what?

36:28.180 --> 36:29.914
Burn him.

36:31.684 --> 36:33.251
I cannot do it, my lord.

36:33.319 --> 36:34.719
<i>COLONNA:</i>
<i>No!</i>

36:36.255 --> 36:38.022
Take him outside,
at least!

36:42.361 --> 36:45.830
Go home, any of you who
would not witness this.

36:45.865 --> 36:47.565
BAGLIONI:
I bid you good night.

36:47.666 --> 36:49.100
CESARE:
I can light up your way.

36:51.203 --> 36:53.505
[gasping]

36:56.609 --> 36:58.042
NO! No!

36:58.077 --> 36:59.377
No, please!

36:59.412 --> 37:00.712
NO! NO!

37:00.746 --> 37:03.848
NO!
[screaming]

37:03.883 --> 37:14.159
[screaming]

37:14.226 --> 37:16.194
<i>[screaming fades away]</i>
<i>Go home now.</i>

37:16.228 --> 37:18.363
And let this be a lesson to
those who would betray me.

37:22.768 --> 37:25.203
You are cruel,
you Romans.

37:25.271 --> 37:28.006
We do not forgive.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.775
So, sell it to me.

37:30.876 --> 37:32.377
I cannot.

37:32.411 --> 37:34.012
I haven't named my price.

37:34.046 --> 37:35.647
It doesn't matter.

37:35.714 --> 37:38.716
Merchants buy, we know,
but they always sell.

37:38.751 --> 37:40.852
Always have their price.
None of this is mine.

37:40.920 --> 37:43.221
I bought it for another.
Let him name his price then.

37:43.289 --> 37:44.789
He has no price.

37:44.890 --> 37:46.458
Why does he want it?

37:48.194 --> 37:51.796
The thought of war...
disturbs him.

37:51.864 --> 37:53.898
Hm.
Man of peace.

37:53.966 --> 37:56.100
You could say that.

37:56.168 --> 37:58.236
Well, I would meet
with this paragon.

37:58.270 --> 37:59.571
And he is a paragon.

37:59.705 --> 38:02.474
It could easily be arranged.

38:03.909 --> 38:05.210
He is your father,

38:05.277 --> 38:07.579
Pope of Rome.

38:17.823 --> 38:19.624
And he would deny me powder?
Yes.

38:19.692 --> 38:22.393
Why?
Isn't it obvious?

38:22.495 --> 38:24.362
Because he fears you!

38:24.430 --> 38:26.764
But we share the same aims.
Fathers and sons.

38:26.866 --> 38:28.299
It is always thus.

38:28.367 --> 38:30.502
I will have my powder.
With your father's permission.

38:32.505 --> 38:34.739
Must I beg?
<i>No.</i>

38:34.807 --> 38:37.075
But, perhaps
I can...

38:37.176 --> 38:39.143
intercede.

38:47.686 --> 38:51.356
In Nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sanctum.

38:51.423 --> 38:54.926
Holiness,
I have commandeered

38:54.994 --> 38:58.096
every ounce of
sulphur in this land.

38:58.163 --> 39:00.231
<i>ALEXANDER: So you are both</i>
<i>a Christian and a peacemaker.</i>

39:00.266 --> 39:02.500
[chuckling]
<i>Is that your intention?</i>

39:02.535 --> 39:04.402
<i>An Italy at peace?</i>

39:04.503 --> 39:06.871
No, not entirely.

39:06.906 --> 39:08.773
<i>MATTAI:</i>
<i>I suspected as much.</i>

39:08.841 --> 39:11.943
And as I have done
all I can for you,

39:12.011 --> 39:14.145
I would return to
the tribe of Abraham.

39:14.213 --> 39:16.548
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

39:16.582 --> 39:18.449
No, we...
we have need of you.

39:18.551 --> 39:20.852
We have further plans.

39:20.886 --> 39:23.121
We have need of a man
with your resource.

39:23.222 --> 39:26.124
But you are surrounded
by advisers, Holiness.

39:26.191 --> 39:28.426
[scoffs]
Cardinals, canon lawyers...

39:28.460 --> 39:31.195
Oh, what do they know
<i>of the real world?</i>

39:31.230 --> 39:33.598
Can we trust them
<i>with anything</i>

39:33.632 --> 39:37.402
other than drawing
<i>up a papal bull?</i>

39:37.469 --> 39:41.239
<i>No, we need you further yet.</i>

39:41.273 --> 39:43.341
We need your hidden hand.

39:43.409 --> 39:45.810
I may have found just
the man, Holiness.

39:45.878 --> 39:48.746
He has talent to burn.
Ah.

39:48.814 --> 39:51.816
It pains him that those
talents are so underused.

39:51.884 --> 39:54.953
What, is he another
Jew, like you?

39:54.987 --> 39:57.088
A Christian.
Oh...

39:57.156 --> 39:58.957
A warrior.
A warrior.

39:59.091 --> 40:01.059
A leader of men.

40:01.093 --> 40:03.328
One that you should take
close to your bosom.

40:05.164 --> 40:07.265
May I introduce
you to him?

40:07.333 --> 40:09.233
What, now?

40:12.171 --> 40:13.905
[sighs]

40:17.109 --> 40:18.776
You would play
games with me?

40:18.811 --> 40:20.111
Don't you talk to me
about playing games.

40:20.179 --> 40:21.779
You would deny me powder?

40:21.814 --> 40:23.114
You would make me think it
was Catherina Sforza's doing?

40:23.148 --> 40:25.650
You would invite the
French army to my doorstep!

40:25.684 --> 40:27.285
We share the
same aims, Father!

40:27.319 --> 40:29.153
But what are your aims?
You do not share them with us!

40:29.188 --> 40:31.322
You keep them secret!
We are the Pope of Rome!

40:31.423 --> 40:32.924
You are also my father

40:32.958 --> 40:34.292
and you still cannot
give me your trust!

40:34.326 --> 40:36.294
[shouting]
GENTLEMEN!

40:37.963 --> 40:40.031
You are family,
are you not?

40:42.968 --> 40:48.806
In my people the bonds
of family are unbreakable.

40:48.841 --> 40:49.907
Even stronger
than family,

40:49.942 --> 40:52.210
the bond between
father and son.

40:52.311 --> 40:54.278
Oh, do you have a son?

40:54.346 --> 40:57.515
It is sacred.

40:57.650 --> 40:59.517
Adam begat Cain.

40:59.585 --> 41:01.619
Who killed his
brother, Abel.

41:01.687 --> 41:03.621
Abraham begat Isaac.

41:03.656 --> 41:04.689
Whom he offered up
for sacrifice.

41:04.790 --> 41:09.093
And God stayed his hand.

41:09.161 --> 41:11.729
And so here we are,

41:11.797 --> 41:14.966
all of us children
of Abraham.

41:16.301 --> 41:20.638
And so I ask this father
to embrace his son.

41:20.673 --> 41:27.578
Give him his sanction,
his support, his love.

41:27.646 --> 41:29.047
His powder,
his armies, his -

41:29.148 --> 41:30.648
His love.

41:33.819 --> 41:35.653
His love.

41:38.390 --> 41:40.658
He is made
in your image.

41:40.693 --> 41:42.493
Do you think
we don't know that?

41:44.997 --> 41:49.467
He is me!

41:49.501 --> 41:53.638
All the fire and
the fury, the drive!

41:53.706 --> 41:58.076
The pitiless ambition!

41:58.143 --> 42:01.312
I look into his eyes,
I see myself!

42:01.346 --> 42:03.347
Do you expect me
to love that?

42:13.192 --> 42:14.525
Can you not love
yourself, Father?

42:42.454 --> 42:45.623
Must we hate
each other then?

42:48.560 --> 42:53.164
Father, please.
Just...

42:53.232 --> 42:56.868
...open your
heart to me.

42:59.238 --> 43:01.606
What have I wrought
for this family?

43:05.744 --> 43:10.548
On the altar of
power and ambition?

43:15.921 --> 43:23.327
A temple built on
rotten foundations.

43:23.395 --> 43:26.264
And you're asking me to let
you continue down the road?

43:27.633 --> 43:29.433
Can't do that.

43:29.501 --> 43:31.769
You have no option, Father.

43:37.142 --> 43:43.981
If we weaken now,
they destroy us.

43:44.082 --> 43:48.886
There's only one road
and that is forward.

43:48.954 --> 43:54.058
Trust me; I will carve
you out an empire.

43:54.126 --> 43:59.530
But abandon me,
and we live in ruins.

44:02.100 --> 44:06.437
So, give it to me -
your trust - at last.

44:15.614 --> 44:19.984
From now on,
you'll have it.

44:30.162 --> 44:32.797
And your forgiveness
for my sins.

44:44.676 --> 44:47.245
Ego te absolvo.
