Well, I know the precise date and time,

04:04.202 --> 04:07.042

Crossed the line.

Nope. Those ideas won't work.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.121
What if we use Melvin's Time Toad

04:48.204 --> 04:51.541
and send the croc-o-bats far away in time
and space to save recess?

04:51.624 --> 04:53.584
Perfect!
Why didn't you start with that one?

04:53.668 --> 04:54.544
Needed to warm up.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.046
So we gotta get them
into the Time Toad somehow.

- What beats a butt?
- Another butt?

19:44.975 --> 19:48.145
[screams, grunts] Tush-ée.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.605
That's word play.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.523
And French, sort of.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.652
Okay, guys, time for us to dance

19:55.736 --> 19:58.197
cheek-to-cheek-to-cheek-to-cheek-to-cheek

19:58.280 --> 20:01.825
- to-cheek-to-cheek-to-cheek-to-cheek
- to-cheek... [inhales]

20:01.909 --> 20:04.077
- To-cheek-to-cheek-to-cheek
- to-cheek-to-cheek...

20:04.161 --> 20:06.705
That's it! We fight butt with butt!

20:07.039 --> 20:09.041
[retro music playing]

20:10.834 --> 20:12.114
[George] It's called "The Bump."

20:12.169 --> 20:13.003
Oh!

20:13.086 --> 20:15.422
Any fool can do that, including me!

20:15.505 --> 20:17.382
Then get down and shake your booty.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.800
But put us down first.

20:19.676 --> 20:23.138
I'm shaking my bacon to victory!

20:23.931 --> 20:25.891
[butt-erflies shrieking]

20:33.732 --> 20:34.942
- [both] Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

20:35.108 --> 20:36.526
Yeah, yeah!

20:36.610 --> 20:37.986
You did it, Captain Underpants!

20:38.320 --> 20:40.239
You put the "boot" in booty.

20:40.864 --> 20:43.242
- [bees buzzing]
- [sighs] Now, what's that noise?

20:47.663 --> 20:49.081
[shrieking]

20:49.373 --> 20:52.376
They're coming back!
Get your rear in gear, Captain Underpants.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.671
I'll try,
but my heinie's running low on gas.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.298
- [fart blows]
- That's the last of it.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.261
Well, I guess this is where
we make our stand, then.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.055
See you on the other side, brother.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.683
[both] For recess!

21:11.019 --> 21:12.479
[cooing]

21:13.272 --> 21:16.233
Hey! Those butt-erflies love wall!

21:16.316 --> 21:19.236
Hey, let's do to the butt-erflies
what we did to the croc-o-bats.

21:19.319 --> 21:21.196
- Yeah.
- [both] To the Time Toad!

21:21.613 --> 21:23.949
[narrator]
<i>Realizing butterflies loved eating wall,</i>

21:24.032 --> 21:27.369
<i>they lured them to the Time Toad
by mixing it with Melvin's mom's meatloaf.</i>

21:27.452 --> 21:30.831
That's right, butt-erflies,
this way to the free wall-loaf.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.602
[imitates Australian accent] G'day, mate.
Throw another wall-loaf on the barbie.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.044
Nice adjustment on the accents.

21:36.128 --> 21:40.674
Oh, you boys and mutants are really
putting away some wall-loaf! [giggles]

21:40.757 --> 21:43.510
Man, I'm getting a lot of wall
in this wall-loaf.

21:45.262 --> 21:50.058
Wall-loaf. Wall loaf. Wall loaf. Hmm.
That's hard to say.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.685
Kinda like cheek-to-cheek!

21:51.768 --> 21:54.372
[normal voice] You think it's okay to send
a bunch of butt-erflies to the future?

21:54.396 --> 21:56.064
Well, we can't send them to the past

21:56.148 --> 21:57.983
'cause that's where we sent
the croc-o-bats.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.527
I'm sure it'll be fine.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.489
<i>♪ It's lonely at the top of the school ♪</i>

22:04.573 --> 22:08.118
[narrator] <i>You ever wonder how Melvin
became half-cyborg in the future?</i>

22:08.201 --> 22:09.786
<i>Well, here's how.</i>

22:09.870 --> 22:11.038
Oh, no!

- [thudding]

22:13.915 --> 22:15.208
[explosion]

22:15.292 --> 22:17.002
I am... half-okay!

22:17.294 --> 22:19.546
Today, we raise the undie flag!

22:19.629 --> 22:22.924
Because we fought the enemies of fun,
and won!

22:23.008 --> 22:24.176
- Oh, yeah!
- [all cheering]

22:24.259 --> 22:25.259
[croc-o-bats laughing]

22:25.469 --> 22:28.930
- Oh, no! The butts are back!
- Those aren't butts.

22:29.097 --> 22:31.349
[narrator]
<i>He's right. They're croc-o-bats.</i>

22:31.433 --> 22:33.101
<i>And they've brought their queen home.</i>

22:33.894 --> 22:35.937
- [all gasping]
- Like, Other Sophie?

22:37.189 --> 22:39.357
Then who are you?
