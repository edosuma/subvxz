WEBVTT

00:14.280 --> 00:17.080
Okay, it's... It's this...

00:17.520 --> 00:18.760
It's quite hard to say.

00:19.520 --> 00:25.040
Basically, it seems like
nobody wants the Trace.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.120
Even my cousin don't fancy me
no more. Look at him.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.320
A couple of months ago, Boy Tracey
couldn't be left in a room with me

00:31.400 --> 00:34.600
without taking his clothes off.
Now, he just goes on and on and on

00:34.680 --> 00:37.160
about all the girls he's banged
and how I'm his goon,

00:37.240 --> 00:39.720
I'm his boy, I'm his cousin.
What went wrong?

00:41.440 --> 00:45.320
I've had two boyfriends.
Nice boys, but both one day decided,

00:45.400 --> 00:47.240
"Ooh, no, don't want the Trace."

00:47.840 --> 00:49.520
Look, in my defence,
Ronald wanted a penis.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.040
Even Beyoncé couldn't give him that.

00:51.240 --> 00:54.440
As for Connor, bless him, it's gonna
take him such a long time to get over me.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.680
Look, last week I saw him kissing

00:56.760 --> 00:59.280
what looked like a hyena
crossbred with a goat.

00:59.360 --> 01:03.680
-And he's gonna keep doing that until I--
-Well, well, well.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.560
[Tracey] Connor, yeah!

01:07.600 --> 01:10.480
Emma, I want you
to meet Tracey, my best friend.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.480
-And your...
-Ex, yeah.

01:16.840 --> 01:20.040
[theme music plays]

01:37.840 --> 01:39.120
[Connor] Tracey, are you...

01:40.040 --> 01:43.800
-Tracey!
-Hello! Yes, of course. Yes.

01:43.960 --> 01:45.320
-Hi!
-[Emma] Okay.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.920
Well, I'll just...

01:50.760 --> 01:53.880
-She alright, isn't she? Like a little--
-Hyena?

01:54.360 --> 01:55.440
-What?
-What?

01:58.840 --> 02:02.360
Like I said, Trace, I've smashed 100 girls
like that. See, I'm special.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.800
Uncle Roy!

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Yes. I've come to help your mother
with the night vigil

02:07.200 --> 02:09.320
since you and Cynthia
have abandoned her.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.040
Oh, thank you, Uncle, so much.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.640
Like Tracey, you are growing fat.

02:13.880 --> 02:17.760
Oh, Uncle! Thank you, thank you, you too.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.320
I hate this man. I hate this man so much.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.280
Brother, we have over 25
in attendance for night vigil!

02:24.360 --> 02:26.560
[both laugh]

02:26.640 --> 02:27.560
[Joy] Hallelujah!

02:27.640 --> 02:30.720
Uncle Roy and Mum is like
sugar-free jam and fake ketchup.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.440
They're not great by themselves anyway,
but you mix that together,

02:33.520 --> 02:35.400
it's a whole 'nother level of disgusting.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.040
Yeah.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.440
Duck face and deuces.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.000
-Uh... Well...
-[camera whirs]

02:41.560 --> 02:44.400
Boy Tracey, will you
evangelise with your aunty

02:44.480 --> 02:47.400
or follow this wayward girl
into chaos and destruction?

02:47.560 --> 02:49.560
Neither. I've got a lady waiting.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.240
Hmm. Womaniser. You are you father's son.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.280
Of course. But what happened to this one?

02:55.480 --> 02:57.560
Brother, I tell her every day.

02:57.960 --> 03:01.840
-"Live your life exactly as I--"
-And I'll be just like you.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.440
But I want to be Rihanna.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.240
Nobody ever fancied me in school.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.240
Nobody fancied me on the estate.
I mean am I... I'm not. Am I ugly?

03:11.560 --> 03:13.560
[all] No!

03:13.960 --> 03:15.720
You're niche.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.400
-Very niche.
-Like K-Pop.

03:17.480 --> 03:20.000
K-Pop? Okay, Karly, well,
the men I've spoken to

03:20.080 --> 03:22.000
do not say "K-Pop".
They say I'm very sweet.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.640
What do you say to these guys?

03:24.040 --> 03:25.080
Well...

03:25.160 --> 03:28.680
Hi! I just wanna say that you're,
like, the buffest guy ever!

03:28.760 --> 03:30.840
You remind me of this guy
in the <i>Freemans </i>Catalogue

03:30.920 --> 03:32.680
that I used to fancy when I was littler.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.960
[all] No!

03:36.040 --> 03:40.560
Tracey, you can't just go up to a guy
and expose yourself. Who does that?

03:40.640 --> 03:44.080
-You gotta wait for them to approach you.
-She'll be waiting a long time, though.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.720
-Real talk.
-Mm.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.520
I feel like you just insulted me
and then you lot agreed with the insult.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.360
-Oh, my God, I'm ugly.
-No, no, no. You are beautiful.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.680
In... in a Whoopi Goldberg kind of--

03:59.920 --> 04:01.160
-Her face!
-Clothes.

04:01.240 --> 04:02.760
<i>-The Color Purple.</i>
-[all] Mm.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.840
-[Candice] Yeah.
-They're looking for Rita Ora.

04:04.920 --> 04:07.560
German's would love you.
They like those sort of clothes.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.160
-Or you could borrow my clothes.
-Ugh, no thanks.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.720
Germans, Karly? So, just go
get myself to Germany?

04:13.800 --> 04:15.640
I can hardly afford
to get myself earrings!

04:15.760 --> 04:18.480
So you're saying, go there or Connor
will be the last boyfriend I have?

04:18.840 --> 04:20.120
[all murmur agreement]

04:20.560 --> 04:22.440
Oh, God. Oh, my...

04:23.920 --> 04:27.520
-[gospel music plays]
-Jesus, high! Satan, low.

04:28.080 --> 04:32.760
Jesus, higher up. Satan, lower down.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.400
In the basement.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.520
Hi, I'm Louise, I'm from the--

04:37.600 --> 04:40.480
-Shut up and make a joyful noise.
-Shut your mouth and praise the Lord.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.760
<i>The Bible </i>says to shout
in praise, my sister.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.120
Night vigil, tonight, 9 p.m.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.720
Uh... I'm from the council.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.360
Oh, my dear, why didn't you say?

04:50.760 --> 04:51.800
Can I have a word?

04:52.600 --> 04:53.600
Okay.

05:02.160 --> 05:05.040
Oh, my god. Tracey, I cannot believe
I've gotta tell you this again.

05:05.200 --> 05:09.080
I'm not interested, okay? Stop wanting
me sexually, stop pining for me, I'm not--

05:09.160 --> 05:10.600
My dad told me to wait up here.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.680
There's a woman that's come
from the council, so...

05:12.760 --> 05:14.960
-Right. Yes. Right.
-She's wearing a suit.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.800
My dad don't trust women
that wear suits. So I'm not trying to--

05:17.880 --> 05:19.760
Yeah, yeah, I know.

05:25.680 --> 05:30.480
Yes, it's a small church, but growing.
I'm occasionally recognised in Asda

05:30.560 --> 05:32.080
and other department stores,

05:32.360 --> 05:35.640
but I want to remain humble,
so my entourage will come later.

05:37.280 --> 05:41.600
-How do you specifically like your tea?
-None for me, thank you.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.640
But it's English breakfast,
like in <i>Downton!</i>

05:43.720 --> 05:45.200
Means nothing to me. I'm Scottish.

05:45.520 --> 05:46.840
What's the difference?

05:47.240 --> 05:49.440
-Look, Pastor Joy--
-Of sorts.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.600
-Excuse me?
-Well, if we are talking technicalisms,

05:52.880 --> 05:55.000
I'm not officially a pastor, yet.

05:55.080 --> 05:59.160
In one way, that sums up my being here
and why I'm coming to the night vigil.

05:59.280 --> 06:02.080
-I don't understand.
-The council has rules.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.120
Your church does not comply with them.

06:04.280 --> 06:08.920
<i>Jesu Christo</i>, I didn't know such rules
applied to the Kingdom of God.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.400
Even to the Kingdom of God.
We welcome multi-faith worship--

06:12.520 --> 06:15.120
-Worship! That's what we do.
-Multi-faith--

06:15.200 --> 06:18.400
My dear, this is nonsense.
Just come to the night vigil.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.000
Your husband and children are welcome.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.240
I don't have a husband,
thank you very much.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.360
You are not married? Oh, no children?

06:26.440 --> 06:29.960
I know, I've managed to maintain
a successful career, an amazing body,

06:30.040 --> 06:33.240
and a sound mind without the assistance
of a man. Wow, unbelievable.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.400
I'll be off, now.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.120
But no children?

06:39.400 --> 06:41.040
And the body clock is ticking.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.840
Does this mean I'm not to have
my free will and individuality

06:43.920 --> 06:46.960
destroyed by a toothless, crying blob?
Soul-destroying news.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.560
I'll be listening, tonight. Closely.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.920
Do you think girls like stimulation
via the clitoris or the vagina itself?

07:00.400 --> 07:01.560
Or are all girls different?

07:01.960 --> 07:04.200
[scoffs] I wouldn't know, Trace.

07:09.080 --> 07:12.600
I mean, are you sure
that you're okay in here?

07:13.080 --> 07:16.440
Last time you were in my bedroom,
you were trying to have sex with me.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.240
So, I don't know how much
your feelings could have changed.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.320
Drastically. Do you wish they hadn't?

07:21.400 --> 07:26.120
No. I'm just saying that if you had
sexual feelings towards me,

07:26.280 --> 07:29.120
I wouldn't mind, because you'd
be the only one that...

07:29.400 --> 07:30.880
-I'm feeling a bit...
-[phone rings]

07:31.000 --> 07:32.520
[exhales] ...funny about my...

07:33.160 --> 07:36.320
-I'm feeling...
-Yes! We're in!

07:37.280 --> 07:38.320
-What?
-Nothing!

07:38.800 --> 07:40.040
Wanna go to a party, tonight?

07:40.400 --> 07:42.680
Come on. [imitates defibrillator]

07:42.760 --> 07:46.040
Like we used to. Me, you...

07:46.400 --> 07:48.840
[both] Tracey’s embarking
on an adventure.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.640
[laughs] It's at this leisure centre.
No, more like a spa club sort of place.

07:52.880 --> 07:56.120
They do different nights. Shamone!

07:56.440 --> 07:57.440
Hmm...

07:58.800 --> 08:01.520
[trilling lips and imitating explosions]

08:02.960 --> 08:04.000
Jackpot, jackpot!

08:05.400 --> 08:06.920
We'll get ready at Candice's, yeah?

08:07.760 --> 08:08.720
Why?

08:08.800 --> 08:10.440
-[Candice] Shut up.
-[Tracey] Can I borrow your perfume?

08:10.520 --> 08:12.280
-[Candice] Of course.
-I like your clothes, man.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.560
[Aaron] ...18, 19, 20.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.440
21. [exhales]

08:19.560 --> 08:21.600
What? Gets the pecs popping.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.080
-You're so vain.
-You get to spend half an hour

08:24.160 --> 08:26.600
doing each side of your face,
but I can't do some push-ups?

08:28.680 --> 08:31.880
Thanks, Candice. Is it
Rita Ora enough? Yeah?

08:32.480 --> 08:34.360
Yeah. Better, babe. Better.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.040
You're lying. Yeah, I love you, anyway.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.520
-All this boy cares about is his body.
-And you. Come and let me teach you.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.680
What are you trying to say? If you've
something to say about my body,

08:46.760 --> 08:49.680
-just be a man and say it, innit.
-I adore every inch of you.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.480
Wish you'd show more of it
tonight, though. Where's that crop top?

08:53.040 --> 08:54.560
Given all your clothes to Whoopi, here?

08:54.920 --> 08:58.240
The way you're wearing them jeans
it's like I gave all my clothes to you.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.920
-Ooh.
-[Candice laughs]

09:00.160 --> 09:01.080
[slaps bottom]

09:01.160 --> 09:02.960
You know I get turned on
when you embarrass me.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.240
[Boy Tracey] Adventure time!

09:12.320 --> 09:13.800
Why is everyone wearing pajamas?

09:14.200 --> 09:16.080
What sort of weird party is this?

09:17.160 --> 09:18.080
Names?

09:19.040 --> 09:20.000
Names?

09:20.080 --> 09:22.160
Hmm. Yes, one moment, please, sir.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.760
Guys, can we group? Can we group?

09:25.560 --> 09:27.600
-What's the dress code?
-[Tracey] [screaming] Candice!

09:28.960 --> 09:30.920
We've gone to the wrong club, okay?

09:31.000 --> 09:34.160
This is some sort of Heavy-R party.
This is not the...

09:35.640 --> 09:37.720
Surprise! [laughs]

09:37.800 --> 09:39.040
Trace, you said "leisure centre".

09:39.440 --> 09:41.960
Do you understand what they're doing
in there? They're having sex.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.480
-Are you having a laugh?
-No, but I thought this might be.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.000
How? For whom? You can't even swim.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.880
I'm trying to live a normal life.
Why'd you feel this appropriate?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.560
Men can't go alone
it's against the rules.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.600
-No, he's having a fucking laugh.
-Aaron, fall back, man.

09:53.720 --> 09:54.800
Did you know about this?

09:54.920 --> 09:57.920
-No!
-Oh, my God, this is fucking nasty!

09:58.000 --> 10:00.480
-It's disgusting, mate.
-I didn't think we'd pass the photo test,

10:00.560 --> 10:02.160
but then we did. I got carried away.

10:02.240 --> 10:05.600
-What photo test are you talking about?
-The selfie we took! That's why I took it.

10:05.720 --> 10:08.160
Are... Are you telling me
that I got into this club

10:08.240 --> 10:09.920
-because of what I look like?
-Yeah.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.440
But, I mean, I don't even have a bikini.

10:15.920 --> 10:16.960
I brought you one.

10:17.880 --> 10:22.280
Did you hear that, Candice? Whoops!
I thought the Trace wasn't on trend.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.640
Turns out I got into PornHub Palace
because of all of this.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.880
Yes, Rita Ora better catch
the next train to Germany,

10:30.960 --> 10:33.760
because the Whoopi Goldberg train is...

10:35.240 --> 10:36.280
Is what?

10:38.400 --> 10:39.560
Don't know. [squeals]

10:39.760 --> 10:41.960
Excuse me. I'm sorry,
I'm one of the buff people.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.520
Buff person coming through. Tracey.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.160
[Boy Tracey] Wait, now.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.600
No way, man, I got my limits.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.440
[sighs] Aaron, calm yourself, man.
We ain't signed up, anyway.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.240
[bouncer] Your face, his arms...

10:51.560 --> 10:52.560
You can walk right in.

10:52.760 --> 10:54.480
No thanks, mate.

10:54.640 --> 10:57.800
So, what? We're just supposed to leave
Tracey by herself, yeah?

10:58.520 --> 10:59.840
[scoffs] Move out the way.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.000
Fucking hell.

11:04.840 --> 11:08.040
Thank you for gathering
at Church of Joy Ministries.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.800
My ministry.

11:10.160 --> 11:13.800
