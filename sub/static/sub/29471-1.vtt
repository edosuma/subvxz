        [Sonny] Yes, sir.
    I saw your help wanted ad

03:00.481 --> 03:02.214
  for a mechanic and I called.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.882
      I talked to your guy,
            uh, Pete,

03:03.884 --> 03:06.285
       and he said he was
 gonna hold the position for me.

      Oh, well, I'm sorry,
Mr. Jordan, but you're too late.

       Wait, sir, listen,

03:14.695 --> 03:16.595
     I came a very long way
           to be here

03:16.597 --> 03:18.363
          because Pete
       promised me a job.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.918
             -[kiss]
          -Good hands.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.795
         [bottle fizzes]

12:51.004 --> 12:53.238
            [George]
 Larissa, have you seen my keys?

13:10.490 --> 13:12.791
        [George snoring]

13:41.555 --> 13:42.987
           Mr. Jordan.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.057
         Yes, Mrs. Good?

13:46.059 --> 13:47.992
       There is something
      I have to say to you.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.161
             -Okay.
   -If you want to stay here,

13:50.163 --> 13:52.430
     you have to stop doing
     what you've been doing.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.133
      What I've been doing?

13:55.135 --> 13:57.502
 You have to stop looking at me
         the way you do.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.608
       And how have I been
         looking at you?

14:03.610 --> 14:05.243
          You know how.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.161
         Why'd you marry
       that old man? Hmm?

14:24.531 --> 14:27.632
 Woman who, uh, looks like you.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.003
           Don't talk
   about my husband that way.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.938
          He likes you.
  I thought you liked him, too.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.107
           I do. I do.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.644
     But I like you better.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.480
 Should I call him and tell him
       how you talk to me
      when he's not around?

14:42.482 --> 14:48.052
      How about I call him,
     tell him face to face,
           man to man?

14:48.054 --> 14:50.455
     Hmm? And you know what
    he'd probably do, right?

14:50.457 --> 14:54.125
       He'd probably, uh,
     send me down the road.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.262
           But is that
      what you really want?

14:57.264 --> 15:01.366
         Do you want me
    to be sent down the road?

15:01.368 --> 15:05.336
 -I thought you needed this job.
     -I've had lots of jobs.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.071
   Lots of women, too, I bet.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.476
       Well, just stop it.

15:13.380 --> 15:17.348
         You know what?
     It just occurred to me.

15:18.551 --> 15:22.654
      Huh. It seems to me
      that in order for me

15:22.656 --> 15:26.557
      to be looking at you
 the way you say I look at you,

15:26.559 --> 15:30.361
        well, you'd have
to be looking at me, too, right?

15:32.599 --> 15:36.534
         [somber music]

15:41.975 --> 15:43.608
        So I went looking
     for go-karts, you know,

15:43.610 --> 15:46.611
       thinking, you know,
 that I was gonna find something

15:46.613 --> 15:49.047
       like I used to make
   when I was a kid, you know,

15:49.049 --> 15:51.516
  [distant sounding] out of a--
   out of a lawnmower engine,

15:51.518 --> 15:55.320
      and I wonder if kids
    make go-karts these days.

15:55.322 --> 16:00.692
  But it might be a good idea
  for us to have competitions,

16:00.694 --> 16:02.493
      maybe with classes...

16:02.495 --> 16:05.964
               ¶¶

16:09.703 --> 16:14.005
Well, forget the money. I'd stay
    around just for the food.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.573
    [George and Sonny laugh]

16:15.575 --> 16:20.545
    Hey, Sonny, how would you
    like a taste of whiskey?

16:21.715 --> 16:23.648
           Yeah. Sure.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.517
 Great. Well, you mind gettin'
 some glasses from the kitchen?

16:26.519 --> 16:29.587
           -Of course.
    -And a little bit of ice
       while you're at it?

16:29.589 --> 16:32.623
          -You got it.
        -And I'm gonna be
       in the livin' room.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.692
             -Okay.
           -All right.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.178
You know, you look a little hot.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.785
      Maybe I can help you
         with that, hmm?

17:03.690 --> 17:06.624
          -How's that?
             -Stop.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.194
              Stop.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.064
    How does that feel? Hmm?

17:13.800 --> 17:15.199
              Stop.

17:20.573 --> 17:21.606
            Stop it.

17:21.608 --> 17:25.476
       [breathing heavily]

17:35.422 --> 17:38.723
   [George] Hey. How long's it
        take to get ice?

17:38.725 --> 17:40.358
         Be right there.

18:31.711 --> 18:32.877
          There you go.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.881
  What are you grinnin' about?

18:39.586 --> 18:42.553
          -I found one.
        -Found one what?

18:42.555 --> 18:44.689
  A carburetor for the Cutlass.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.190
              -No!
              -Yep.

18:46.192 --> 18:48.793
       And I already took
         the old one out

18:48.795 --> 18:50.828
     so you can match it up
        with the new one.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.197
          But, listen,
  you got to hurry because, uh,

18:53.199 --> 18:55.433
     they said someone else
 already called about it, so...

18:55.435 --> 18:57.768
Oh. Damn right I'm gonna hurry.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.337
           [chuckles]

19:01.341 --> 19:02.907
        I'll be a while!

         [Sonny moaning]

19:20.260 --> 19:22.226
      Where did George go?

19:23.396 --> 19:24.695
     He went to get a part.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.465
  How long is he gonna be gone?

19:27.467 --> 19:30.334
       Oh. At least three
         or four hours.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.238
   -I better get back inside.
       -Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.441
  Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
    I think you should stay.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.644
     You're making me dirty.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.436
          [Sonny] Whoa.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.944
         Take this off.

20:43.409 --> 20:47.712
        Larissa! Come on!
   I wanna show you somethin'!

            Come on!

       you know, one of--
 I forget what they called 'em.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.835
          They had them
      in the '50s and '60s,

21:10.837 --> 21:14.538
   where you build these cars
  and you wreck 'em, you know.

 -A carburetor for the Cutlass.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.387
         Sonny found it.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.821
            -Did he?
             -Yeah.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.357
          [whispering]
  Tell you what, he's a keeper.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.593
          How we doin'?

21:35.595 --> 21:38.696
   [Sonny] All right, give me
   two seconds, two seconds.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.632
      All right. Go ahead.

        Hold on. Hold on.

21:44.704 --> 21:45.970
          Let me just--

21:48.741 --> 21:50.574
           All right.
     Go ahead. Try it again.

        -[engine starts]
            -It runs!

21:52.612 --> 21:55.913
       -Hot damn! It runs!
 -It still needs some adjusting.

21:55.915 --> 21:58.015
     Yeah, I can hear that,
      but I tell you what,

21:58.017 --> 21:59.750
   I'm-a run her down the road
         a mile or two.

21:59.752 --> 22:00.918
      See how she handles.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.087
            [Larissa]
       George, be careful.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.423
            Darlin',
    it's only a mile or two.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.425
       I'll be right back.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.866
             [Sonny]
     We need to be careful.

22:17.403 --> 22:20.071
   -Did George say anything?
   -No. And he won't, either,

22:20.073 --> 22:22.907
     unless you start acting
  different towards me or him.

22:24.410 --> 22:27.511
           -Different?
  -Yes. Getting all nice to us,

22:27.513 --> 22:29.613
   as if you actually like me
        all of a sudden,

22:29.615 --> 22:31.682
   and being extra nice to him
     because you're guilty.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.384
      It's a dead giveaway.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.052
    You sound like an expert.
      Is that what you are?

22:35.054 --> 22:37.488
      An expert at sleeping
     with other men's wives?

22:37.490 --> 22:38.789
      As much as an expert
           as you are

22:38.791 --> 22:41.092
          with cheating
        on your husband.

22:41.094 --> 22:43.761
       I'm not an expert.
   I've never done it before.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.796
         It didn't help,
    you covering me in grease

22:45.798 --> 22:47.732
all over with your dirty hands.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.834
      Took me over an hour
 in the bath to wash it all off.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.469
    Well, look. There it is.

22:51.471 --> 22:55.406
     Next time just call me,
       and I'll help you.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.876
There won't be next time, okay?

22:58.878 --> 23:00.845
        We were curious.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.580
  We got it out of our systems,

23:02.582 --> 23:05.082
     and now we can move on
     like it never happened.

23:05.084 --> 23:07.418
    Yeah, but it did happen.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.153
     I mean it. Never again.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.124
           Yeah, boy.
        She'll run great

23:13.126 --> 23:15.993
     once we adjust the idle
      and the fuel mixture.

23:15.995 --> 23:19.730
      Can't wait to get her
    out on the turnpike, man,

23:19.732 --> 23:21.999
     and really open her up.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.403
        For you, darlin'.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.905
            -For me?
    -Of course it's for you.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.907
       -George, thank you.
            -Darlin'.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.509
               Oh.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.577
     -Everything's for you.
        -You're so sweet.

23:33.579 --> 23:36.881
        Come on. Get in.
 Let's see how it looks on you.

23:37.817 --> 23:40.418
      [George] Oh, darlin'.

23:41.187 --> 23:44.422
  You look so classy, darlin'.

23:44.424 --> 23:47.658
           -Don't she?
     -Yes, sir. Real classy.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.995
            Come on.
    I wanna see you drive it.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.430
         [engine starts]

23:57.103 --> 23:59.804
       [George] Let's go--
   let's go grab a McDonald's.

24:10.116 --> 24:13.050
            [George]
   He says, "What does a woman

24:13.052 --> 24:16.020
 -and a tornado have in common?"
        -[Sonny] Mm-hmm.

24:16.022 --> 24:19.490
    [George] "They both moan
    like hell when they come

24:19.492 --> 24:21.625
  and take the house with them
         when they go."

24:21.627 --> 24:23.727
           -[laughing]
   -[Sonny] That's a good one.

24:23.729 --> 24:28.132
        -[both laughing]
       -That's a good one.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.800
     You know, I got a joke.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.802
         Well, go ahead.
     Tell it. Don't be shy.

24:31.804 --> 24:35.005
    Okay. So a man's in bed
    with another man's wife.

24:35.007 --> 24:36.874
             Uh-oh.

24:36.876 --> 24:39.810
 And all of a sudden, they hear
     her husband driving up.

24:39.812 --> 24:43.247
       And the wife says,
"Oh, my God! My husband's home!"

24:43.249 --> 24:45.683
     And the boyfriend says,
    "Where's your back door?"

24:45.685 --> 24:48.519
         The wife says,
  "We don't have a back door."

24:48.521 --> 24:51.755
       The boyfriend says,
 "Well, where do you want one?"

24:51.757 --> 24:55.860
           [laughing]

24:55.862 --> 24:58.796
     [George] Wait a minute.
 Wait a minute. That reminds me.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.764
          I've got one.
     It's almost like that.

25:00.766 --> 25:04.235
 When the wife and the boyfriend
     hear the husband come,

25:04.237 --> 25:07.505
       the boyfriend says,
    "Where's your back door?"

25:07.507 --> 25:09.673
      But the wife screams,

25:09.675 --> 25:12.510
       "We ain't got time
  for my back door. You crazy?

25:12.512 --> 25:14.144
       My husband's home!"

25:14.146 --> 25:15.880
            -George!
           -[laughing]

25:15.882 --> 25:18.282
    You're completely wasted.
        I'm going to bed.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.084
          Oh, darlin'.
   Come on, come on, come on.

25:20.086 --> 25:22.753
       Don't be like that.

25:22.755 --> 25:25.956
      Larissa! Goddamn it.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.758
    -I'm gonna pay for that.
              -Hmm.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.760
        She don't like it
         when I'm crude.

25:29.762 --> 25:33.597
   Women just don't understand
that a man's got to have a drink

25:33.599 --> 25:36.133
      and tell a dirty joke
  once in a while. Am I right?

25:36.135 --> 25:39.603
    Absolutely, you're right.
    Here. Let me refill you.

25:39.605 --> 25:42.940
     Women and men just have
   a different sense of humor.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.709
        Don't be stingy,
  pour a drink for a man, son.

25:47.647 --> 25:48.879
          There you go.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.052
             "Son."

25:57.223 --> 25:59.056
   I had a son once, you know.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.592
              Alan.

26:02.295 --> 26:03.761
         [groans softly]

26:04.931 --> 26:06.297
           Alan Good.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.967
           [chuckles]
     He was a good boy, too.

26:11.671 --> 26:14.638
    He'd be just about as old
         as you are now.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.977
      [George] Just as big,
         too, I'll bet.

26:21.581 --> 26:22.913
        [whispers] Jesus.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.616
             Mm-hmm.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.986
            [groans]

26:32.758 --> 26:35.292
        [George snoring]

27:33.419 --> 27:34.918
         [Sonny grunts]

27:34.920 --> 27:37.821
        [dramatic music]

27:39.158 --> 27:40.257
        [Sonny] Oh, yes.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.128
            Oh, God.

27:50.136 --> 27:52.236
            [panting]

28:03.282 --> 28:05.149
        [Larissa moaning]

28:07.319 --> 28:09.720
           Shhh! Shhh!

28:09.722 --> 28:11.255
              Shhh!

28:12.191 --> 28:13.957
            [moaning]

28:14.794 --> 28:16.760
              Shhh!

28:17.430 --> 28:19.763
         [muffled moans]

28:22.334 --> 28:25.235
        [sighs, chuckles]

28:29.241 --> 28:30.774
          I hate this.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.444
              What?

28:33.446 --> 28:35.979
    Oh, just sneaking around,
            cheating.

28:37.249 --> 28:40.184
         -We could stop.
         -Oh, we should.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.453
     Is that what you want?

28:45.791 --> 28:48.826
  Why'd you marry George, huh?

28:48.828 --> 28:52.396
      I was scared, alone,

28:52.398 --> 28:54.064
     I barely spoke English,

28:54.066 --> 28:57.034
   work at the shittiest jobs
        you can imagine.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.269
        You have no idea.

28:59.271 --> 29:02.172
           Oh, no, no.
      I get it. Believe me.

29:02.174 --> 29:05.008
      But where did George
         come into this?

29:06.345 --> 29:09.880
I worked as a maid at this motel
        when he came in.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.282
          He was lonely
  after his wife had left him,

29:13.419 --> 29:16.320
  and, um, he liked my accent.

29:16.322 --> 29:18.322
    What? You have an accent?

29:18.324 --> 29:21.125
              -Hmm.
           -[laughing]

29:25.064 --> 29:26.497
    When he brought me here,

29:26.499 --> 29:30.501
   this place seemed like a--
        like a sanctuary.

29:30.503 --> 29:34.772
              -Hm.
   -Now it feels like a cage.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.140
           [Sonny] Hm.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.342
         What about you?
       Where are you from?

29:38.344 --> 29:41.278
     -You really wanna know?
          -Course I do.

29:41.280 --> 29:45.482
           [chuckles]
 Originally, I'm from St. Louis.

29:45.484 --> 29:48.819
    I grew up in foster care
       and reform schools.

29:48.821 --> 29:52.022
      A ward of the state,
   that's what they called it.

29:54.126 --> 29:58.829
 You wouldn't believe the things
   that go on in those places.

29:58.831 --> 30:03.033
 Believe me, I'd die before I'd
let a kid of mine end up in one.

30:07.506 --> 30:11.842
         -I'm so sorry.
              -Nah.

30:11.844 --> 30:15.979
    I guess we both just have
   really shitty stories, huh?

30:15.981 --> 30:17.381
          Yeah, we do.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.250
   You ever think of leaving?

30:20.252 --> 30:23.020
      George? And go where?

30:23.022 --> 30:24.488
     I don't know, anywhere,
            you know,

30:24.490 --> 30:26.390
    -just to be on your own.
      -I tried it already,

30:26.392 --> 30:29.293
     and it wasn't pretty.
     Not when you're broke.

30:29.295 --> 30:33.230
But what if you had money, would
   you-- would you leave then?

30:33.232 --> 30:37.234
           -With you?
         -With anybody.

30:38.838 --> 30:41.338
     You know what, I should
   really get out of here now.

30:43.375 --> 30:47.477
         If I had money,
       I'd do it with you.

30:58.424 --> 31:01.558
 Sonny, we're going for a ride.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.328
            Where to?

31:07.233 --> 31:11.635
       -[removing gloves]
      -[truck door closes]

31:11.637 --> 31:13.503
         [engine starts]

31:19.612 --> 31:22.212
     [Sonny] So, uh, George,
     uh, where are we going?

31:22.214 --> 31:23.447
      [George] You'll see.

31:27.887 --> 31:31.555
   -So what's going on, Sonny?
       -What do you mean?

31:31.557 --> 31:34.524
 With you. Be straight with me.

31:38.898 --> 31:42.332
   George, you know, it just--

31:42.334 --> 31:46.336
      Sonny, I need to know
      what your plans are.

31:46.338 --> 31:49.473
    I need to know if you're
    stayin' on or movin' on.

31:49.475 --> 31:53.543
      -I just need to know.
              -Why?

31:54.480 --> 31:55.946
           Come here.

31:55.948 --> 31:58.181
           I want you
     to take a look around,

31:58.183 --> 31:59.516
     tell me what you think.

32:01.921 --> 32:04.254
          -About what?
         -The location.

32:06.225 --> 32:10.060
   The location? It's a dump.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.662
         -[laughs] Yeah!
             -Yeah.

32:11.664 --> 32:14.564
     Right now, it's a dump.

32:14.566 --> 32:20.103
       On the map, this is
just a country road in the woods
       with not much else.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.406
       But in six months,
       they're gonna build

32:22.408 --> 32:25.475
       an alternate route
      right through there.

32:25.477 --> 32:27.511
            Now, it's
    just a mile long, Sonny,

32:27.513 --> 32:30.447
           but that's
     a million dollar mile,

32:30.449 --> 32:33.984
    because all of a sudden,
      this road is gonna be

32:33.986 --> 32:37.654
         an access route
       to the interstate.

32:37.656 --> 32:42.726
  When that happens, this dump
     is gonna be a gold mine

32:42.728 --> 32:45.562
   for the man with the vision
         to jump on it.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.599
  Okay. And what's the vision?

32:49.601 --> 32:53.971
   I'm gonna build what I have
       always dreamed of.

32:53.973 --> 32:56.106
       A motorsports park.

32:56.108 --> 32:59.443
      -A motorsports park?
             -Yeah!

32:59.445 --> 33:02.512
        I'm gonna put in
        a race car track

33:02.514 --> 33:06.550
 for sports cars and motorbikes
        right over there.

33:06.552 --> 33:11.455
    A go-kart track for kids,
  an autocross path over there,

33:11.457 --> 33:13.623
           food court
     with shops over there.

33:13.625 --> 33:16.760
       Hell, I might even
    put in a casino one day.

33:16.762 --> 33:21.565
    [laughs] Okay. So you're
 thinking about buying the lot?

33:21.567 --> 33:26.103
   Sonny, I already bought it!
I already got the loan to build!

33:26.105 --> 33:31.241
     I got it all worked out
       down to the dollar.

33:31.243 --> 33:35.278
    I can see it like it's--
    like it's already there.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.615
    So what about you, Sonny?

33:40.486 --> 33:41.685
         Can you see it?

33:43.589 --> 33:45.155
     [Larissa] I can see it.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.391
    I can see it real clear.

33:47.393 --> 33:48.725
        [Sonny chuckles]

33:48.727 --> 33:50.527
    Well, why didn't he tell me?

33:50.529 --> 33:53.530
  Ah. He just wanted everything
       to be set up first.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.599
     So racetrack over there

33:55.601 --> 33:58.135
      and the karting track
    for the kids to the left.

33:58.137 --> 34:01.638
    Mm-hmm. And a food court
     and a filling station,

34:01.640 --> 34:04.074
    and he's also gonna have
     a, uh, mechanic's shop

34:04.076 --> 34:07.811
  that he says I'll be running,
  maybe even a casino one day.

34:09.214 --> 34:12.149
-This changes everything, Sonny.
             -Yeah.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.650
          This could be
       all we ever wanted.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.085
              Yeah.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.757
     What do you mean "we?"

34:20.759 --> 34:23.527
       I mean, you and me,
           of course.

34:23.529 --> 34:27.397
     -Wait, are you serious?
             -Yeah.

34:27.399 --> 34:30.534
  But... this is George's plan.

34:30.536 --> 34:32.601
   I mean, how are we supposed
      to get him out of it?

34:34.239 --> 34:36.806
    [Larissa] Exactly. How do
    we get George out of it?

34:38.510 --> 34:43.112
       Larissa... [scoffs]

34:43.114 --> 34:44.614
    they give you the needle

34:44.616 --> 34:47.117
    for what you're thinking
      about in this state.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.686
     So what you're talking
         about is crazy.

34:49.688 --> 34:52.856
     You're the one talking.
     I haven't said a word.

34:52.858 --> 34:56.126
    Well, you don't have to,
  because I can read your mind.

34:56.128 --> 34:58.528
       And what do you see
       in my mind, Sonny?

34:58.530 --> 35:02.499
 I see someone who doesn't want
   to just take a man's life.

35:02.501 --> 35:05.669
 -You wanna take his dream, too.
       -This is my dream!

35:05.671 --> 35:08.238
  I've been pushing and shoving
        this man for ages

35:08.240 --> 35:10.507
    to do more with his life,
         with our lives.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.742
   Well, it looks like he is.

35:14.513 --> 35:17.547
            Too late.
 This was before you came along.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.683
               Me?

35:25.858 --> 35:31.661
      -[breathing heavily]
         -[fan whirring]

35:40.772 --> 35:43.840
    [whirring growing louder]

36:10.169 --> 36:12.169
     -[Larissa] Oh, George!
       -[George] Sweetie!

36:12.171 --> 36:15.305
   George, I can't believe it!
    Show me-- show me again.

36:15.307 --> 36:16.907
All right, I'll show you again.

36:16.909 --> 36:22.679
    Well, obviously, this is
 the go-kart racetrack for kids.

36:22.681 --> 36:26.950
   Here, on the second floor,
         is a food court
         and also shops.

36:26.952 --> 36:29.486
       Um, there should be
           a toy store

36:29.488 --> 36:32.722
      with cars and trucks
   that kids are crazy about.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.892
   Now, you see there? I would
   never have thought of that.

36:35.894 --> 36:39.229
       That's why we make
       such a good team.

36:39.231 --> 36:41.765
          When do you think
    it's gonna be done and open?

36:41.767 --> 36:46.436
     Oh, about-- about six,
    eight months for basics.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.572
   That'll give us cash flow.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.907
  The rest we'll do over time.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.976
      I got a name for it:

36:52.978 --> 36:57.514
         the Good Family
        Motorsports Park.

36:57.516 --> 37:01.418
          I love that!
           I love it.

37:02.654 --> 37:05.288
       [man] So you think
    it's the clutch or what?

37:05.290 --> 37:07.724
        Sonny, you think
        it's the clutch?

37:07.726 --> 37:09.693
     You know, it felt like
     it's the clutch to me.

37:09.695 --> 37:13.263
             -What?
          -Seemed like
    it was the clutch to me,

37:13.265 --> 37:14.831
  'cause it keep jumping, man.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.967
     When I put it in first,
      you know, it's okay,

37:16.969 --> 37:19.502
    but when I start trying
to put it in second and third,

37:19.504 --> 37:21.771
      it start doing, like,
   this little jumping thing.

37:21.773 --> 37:25.675
   Yeah, man, I tell you what,
I just put $2,500 in this thing.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.410
   Thinking about selling it.

37:27.412 --> 37:30.280
    Put a alternator in here,
     had to put a generator.

37:30.282 --> 37:32.682
      Air conditioner alone
     cost me almost a grand.

37:32.684 --> 37:33.883
             Mm-hmm.

37:41.493 --> 37:44.661
             -Sonny.
  -I saw you with him earlier.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.463
   And you were all over him.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.531
   What do you want me to do?
     He's still my husband.

37:48.533 --> 37:49.866
     Yeah, but not for long.

37:51.270 --> 37:53.603
       -What do you mean?
     -You know what I mean.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.910
  We're not good people, are we?

38:00.912 --> 38:02.579
  I'll show you how good we are.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.019
           Yes. Yeah.

38:09.021 --> 38:10.520
  You wanna be bad, don't you?

38:10.522 --> 38:12.756
             -Yeah.
            -Tell me.

38:12.758 --> 38:15.392
  -Tell me. Are we bad people?
          -Yeah! Yeah!

38:15.394 --> 38:17.761
       -Are we bad people?
            -We are.

           [groaning]

38:28.040 --> 38:29.806
       Oh, I'm a bad man.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.309
       -[Larissa panting]
   -[Sonny] Oh, I'm a bad man.

38:41.520 --> 38:45.055
    [backup warning beeping]

38:59.338 --> 39:00.770
 We just wanted to let you know

39:00.772 --> 39:03.740
        how much we hope
 that your sister feels better.

39:03.742 --> 39:05.875
         She'll be okay.
Should just be a couple of days.

39:05.877 --> 39:09.779
   Well, we'll we'd be holding
down the fort till you get back.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.881
        Hey, once again,
       thanks for the car.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.516
       [Larissa] You bet.

39:13.518 --> 39:14.984
           I promise,
 I'll take real good care of it.

39:14.986 --> 39:16.553
        Well, you better.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.388
           -[laughing]
        -[engine starts]

39:19.691 --> 39:21.624
         -See you soon.
         -See you soon.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.581
        -Hey. [chuckles]
        -Sorry I'm late.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.816
       There was a tie-up
         on the highway.

39:46.818 --> 39:49.452
Just as long as you're here now.

39:49.454 --> 39:51.020

      [truck horn blaring]

40:03.902 --> 40:06.069
       What if we made it
      look like a robbery?

40:06.071 --> 40:09.105
    No, no. That's how we met
  in the first place, remember?

40:09.107 --> 40:10.640
    And how would that look?

40:10.642 --> 40:12.475
      He almost gets killed
          in a robbery,

40:12.477 --> 40:13.943
     then six months later,
 he gets killed in another one?

40:13.945 --> 40:15.812
          And I'm there
   for both of them? Come on.

40:15.814 --> 40:18.148
        Then what, Sonny?
      I'm not good at this.

40:18.150 --> 40:20.150
        Well, I've never
     done it before, either.

40:20.152 --> 40:21.618
       But whatever we do,

40:21.620 --> 40:23.520
        we have to do it
    sooner than later, okay?

40:23.522 --> 40:25.922
    It's a miracle he hasn't
      caught on to us yet.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.858
  Well, he's been so distracted
       by the motor park.

40:35.867 --> 40:38.535
            How about
     an accident maybe, huh?

40:40.539 --> 40:42.739
         We could, uh...
     we could rig something

40:42.741 --> 40:44.707
         to make it look
     like it just happened.

40:44.709 --> 40:48.678
         Like you and I,
  we had nothing to do with it.

41:21.046 --> 41:23.780
            Come on,
   I wanna show you something.

41:26.718 --> 41:28.084
      Okay. Close the door.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.521
           All right.

41:34.793 --> 41:37.694
   Okay, listen, I'm gonna be
   working under the tractor,

41:37.696 --> 41:39.529
    and I'm gonna tell George
      that I need his help.

41:39.531 --> 41:40.930
           And as soon
     as he's in the position

41:40.932 --> 41:44.133
  that that melon's in, then...

41:44.135 --> 41:46.936
        You ready? Watch.

41:52.143 --> 41:55.078
   See? This lift is ancient,

41:55.080 --> 41:57.614
    and I wore the safety cog
        down just enough

41:57.616 --> 41:59.949
     to make it look like it
 could have slipped at any time.

42:01.186 --> 42:05.221
      But if you are gonna
   be down there with George,

42:05.223 --> 42:07.290
            then who
    is gonna pull the lever?

42:10.729 --> 42:12.695
    No. No, I can't do that.

42:12.697 --> 42:13.830
        -Listen, listen!
        -I can't do this.

42:13.832 --> 42:16.966
  It has to be this way, okay?

42:16.968 --> 42:18.268
          I have to be
     down there with George

42:18.270 --> 42:20.136
    to get him into position,

42:20.138 --> 42:22.272
   and I can't pull the lever
        from down there.

42:26.311 --> 42:28.945
             Maybe--
    maybe you can use a rope,

42:28.947 --> 42:30.980
     and you could just tie
     that rope to the lever.

42:30.982 --> 42:32.582
     -Wait a minute, a rope?
             -Yeah.

42:32.584 --> 42:33.983
     George is gonna be able
          to see that.

42:33.985 --> 42:36.920
         He's not blind.
        Now listen to me.

42:36.922 --> 42:39.889
   Do you want do this or not?

42:58.009 --> 42:59.175
           Come here.

43:03.148 --> 43:06.149

      that we oughta, like,

 you know, get on the computer,

      start lookin' around
     and seein', you know--

       any kind of people

              Huh!

43:23.034 --> 43:26.636
       They're expensive,
       way too expensive.

43:26.638 --> 43:30.306
    We'll see what we can do.
 Find something cheap, you know?

43:30.308 --> 43:32.709

 Though I guess we could go out

43:32.711 --> 43:34.777
        and find somebody
       knows how to do it.

43:34.779 --> 43:37.213
        We just need to,
     you know, do research.

43:39.951 --> 43:41.751
    God, I love these beans.

43:43.054 --> 43:45.688

              -Yep.

50:41.406 --> 50:44.040
              -And?
   -Russian, pretty, stylish.

50:44.042 --> 50:47.610
      Not the kind of woman
    you would expect to marry
       a tractor mechanic.

50:47.612 --> 50:51.180
 -Thing about the wife, clothes.
            -Clothes?

50:51.182 --> 50:53.115
        I'm thinking back
  on when Mrs. Good came home,

50:53.117 --> 50:55.284
          she's wearing
       this flowery dress,

50:55.286 --> 50:58.521
        hair wind-blown,
  driving in a-- a convertible.

50:58.523 --> 51:00.389
   Like I said, like a picture
       out of a magazine,

51:00.391 --> 51:02.224
      all except the shoes.

51:02.226 --> 51:03.659
           -Her shoes?
             -Yeah.

51:03.661 --> 51:06.062
          She's wearing
    these dirty tennis shoes

51:06.064 --> 51:08.431
       like you would wear
  to mow the lawn or something.

51:08.433 --> 51:10.099
               So?

51:10.101 --> 51:11.767
       So who do you know
   that goes grocery shopping

51:11.769 --> 51:14.537
    looking like Grace Kelly,
       wearing some nasty,

51:14.539 --> 51:16.705
         ratty-looking,
      raggedy tennis shoes?

51:16.707 --> 51:18.107
       Who's Grace Kelly?

51:20.411 --> 51:23.279
           All right,
    maybe her feet were sore.

51:23.281 --> 51:25.714
      Maybe her Mary Janes
  were nippin' on her bunions.

51:25.716 --> 51:27.149
  Maybe she has foot problems.

51:27.151 --> 51:28.517
        Or maybe she had
       to ditch the shoes

51:28.519 --> 51:30.219
      that she was wearing
           in a hurry,

51:30.221 --> 51:32.088
 -because she got blood on them.
            -Come on.

      to the release lever

     that drops the tractor

51:35.827 --> 51:38.394
     on your husband's head,
       crushing his skull,

51:38.396 --> 51:40.596
     you're definitely gonna
     get blood on your shoes

51:40.598 --> 51:42.665
    because of the splatter.

51:42.667 --> 51:44.700
         And in a hurry,
   she grabs her old sneakers.

51:44.702 --> 51:47.736
     Exactly. And that's why
  we need to canvass that road

51:47.738 --> 51:49.472
          from the shop
     all the way into town.

51:49.474 --> 51:50.840
     That's, like, 15 miles.

51:53.511 --> 51:56.312
      Okay. We'll canvass.

51:56.314 --> 51:58.681
       -Tomorrow morning.
           -Copy that.

    on this side of the road?

52:04.155 --> 52:05.588
           I told you,
    I threw one to the right,

52:05.590 --> 52:07.456
    the other one to the left
         down the road.

52:07.458 --> 52:09.758
           Yeah. Well,
      we have to find them.

52:09.760 --> 52:11.760
      But I wiped them off.

52:11.762 --> 52:13.262
   Don't you watch television?

52:13.264 --> 52:14.497
         Wiping them off
       isn't good enough.

52:14.499 --> 52:16.298
        Anybody could
     spot them out here.

52:16.300 --> 52:17.533
         Anybody but us.

52:21.239 --> 52:23.539
 What did the police say to you
    when they talked to you?

52:23.541 --> 52:27.476
    Nothing. A detective just
   told me about the accident.

52:28.846 --> 52:30.613
         What about you?

52:30.615 --> 52:32.515
  They asked me some questions
     in the emergency room.

52:32.517 --> 52:35.851
           -Detective?
     -No, just a patrolman.

52:40.591 --> 52:42.324
     What did you tell them?

52:42.326 --> 52:44.894
 I told them what we worked out
       I would tell them.

             -What?

           It's done.

    You wanted it just as bad
      as I did, even more.

52:59.877 --> 53:02.811
      It was you who wanted
  to get rid of him, remember?

53:02.813 --> 53:05.381

      to keep it together.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:00.262
            Larissa.

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:20.983
            [groans]

01:00:58.322 --> 01:00:59.788
        [car door closes]

01:01:01.659 --> 01:01:04.226
        [distant thunder]

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:08.397
        Whoa, here, here,
        let me help you.

01:01:08.399 --> 01:01:10.332
          You should be
    in the shop, Mr. Jordan.

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:19.975
        [distant thunder]

01:01:56.947 --> 01:01:58.346
            We can't.

01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:00.816
        Sonny, we can't.

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:03.218
          No, we can't.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:06.354
    [Sonny breathing heavily]

01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:08.857
            We can't.

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.793
        Sonny, we can't.

01:02:21.305 --> 01:02:22.904
         [man on phone]
       Ames Construction.

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:25.240
         -Larissa Good.
           -Mrs. Good,

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:28.343
     I was really, uh, sorry
   to hear about your husband.

01:02:28.345 --> 01:02:31.379
 Um, he was a really nice guy.
 Everybody over here liked him.

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:32.514
           Thank you.

01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:34.750
  I'm calling to tell you that

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:36.485
         I'm gonna keep
       my husband's plans.

01:02:36.487 --> 01:02:39.921
    And I'd also like to make
  a few changes to the design.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:41.456
      It's gonna be great.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.460
            Oh, wait.

01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:49.397
       Now, the furniture,
  I need the chairs over there.

01:02:49.399 --> 01:02:52.100
    [continuing indistinctly]

01:02:54.972 --> 01:02:57.439
       [cell phone rings]

01:02:59.042 --> 01:03:01.143
            [ringing]

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:06.348
            [ringing]

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:09.518
          -[Sonny] Oh.
        -[ringing stops]

01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:12.954
            -Hello.
 -Mrs. Good, Detective Crawford.

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:16.792
    We met the night of your
  husband's accident, remember?

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:20.362
       Detective Crawford?
       How can I help you?

01:03:20.364 --> 01:03:21.963
I'm trying to reach Mr. Jordan,

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:24.432
            but he's
   not picking up in the shop.

01:03:24.434 --> 01:03:27.402
 -Have you tried his cell phone?
     -No luck there, either.

01:03:27.404 --> 01:03:29.237
   He might have stepped out.

01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:31.139
     I can have him call you
      as soon as I see him.

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:32.941
         Nothing urgent,
      but it is important.

01:03:32.943 --> 01:03:34.209
           Of course.

01:03:34.211 --> 01:03:35.977
         Why, thank you.
         Good night now.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:37.345
           Good night.

01:03:39.383 --> 01:03:41.216
       Detective Crawford
       wants to see you.

01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:42.818
            What for?

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.420
         He didn't say.
   You have to call him back.

01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:46.922
   Use the phone in the shop.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.325
     [Crawford] Mr. Jordan,
   you busy tomorrow morning?

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:52.527
     I'd like you to come in
           if you can.

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:55.130
           -Tomorrow?
         -Is 10:00 okay?

01:03:56.433 --> 01:03:58.200
            What for?

01:03:58.202 --> 01:04:00.936
  Some things I wanna go over.
        Won't take long.

01:04:00.938 --> 01:04:04.206
    Well, you couldn't ask me
      what you wanna ask me
         over the phone?

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:05.941
 It'd be better if you came in.

01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:10.545
       Okay, 10:00 it is.

01:04:10.547 --> 01:04:12.848
      Great. Can Mrs. Good
         bring you over?

01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:16.251
  Or I could send a patrol car
  to bring you in if you like.

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:17.619
            Yeah, no,
    no need for a patrol car.

01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:19.020
    Yeah, I'll ask Mrs. Good.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:20.355
            I'm sure
    she can make that happen.

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:22.524
   Great, great. See you then.

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:30.165
           -You heard.
   -Why did he ask to see you?

01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:31.399
          I don't know.

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:33.602
They must have found something.

01:04:33.604 --> 01:04:34.970
         I have no idea.

01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:38.874
   They might be watching us.

01:04:38.876 --> 01:04:41.343
   They might have us bugged.
  What if they have us bugged?

01:04:41.345 --> 01:04:44.246
     If they had us bugged,
    we'd be in jail already.

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:46.348
    Besides, they need to get
       a warrant for that.

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:50.952
    Right. Because the police
    always follow the rules.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.489
            Come on,
    we don't have much time.

01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:29.291
     Should've sealed it up
       after the accident.

01:05:29.293 --> 01:05:31.059
       Didn't know it was
       a crime scene then.

01:05:31.061 --> 01:05:32.961
        -Well, you didn't
         know it wasn't.
          -Yeah, yeah.

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:42.470
            [Larissa]
 Do you want me to wait for you?

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:44.139
           [Sonny] No.

01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:46.675
          I'll call you
  when I need to be picked up.

01:05:46.677 --> 01:05:51.379
   If I need to be picked up.
       If they let me go.

01:05:51.381 --> 01:05:52.547
         Don't say that.

01:05:54.952 --> 01:05:56.318
     I'll talk to you later.

01:06:07.731 --> 01:06:09.297
         [engine starts]

01:06:11.068 --> 01:06:13.301
     [police radio chatter]

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:32.988
           Mr. Jordan,
    thank you for coming in.

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:34.589
           Detective,
     what's this all about?

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:37.192
  You told me 10 a.m. I've been
    waiting over an hour now.

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:39.627
     It couldn't be helped.
    But this won't take long.

01:06:39.629 --> 01:06:42.564
  Just a couple of speed bumps
       I need to get over.

01:06:42.566 --> 01:06:44.299
          Speed bumps?

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:46.634
       Yeah, speed bumps.
  You know, make you slow down,

01:06:46.636 --> 01:06:50.305
    give you a chance to look
at things a little more closely.

01:06:50.307 --> 01:06:51.673
     Yeah, like what things?

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:56.511
       Just a few things.
     That's all. Few things.

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:59.214
     But I already told you
    everything that happened.

01:06:59.216 --> 01:07:00.515
     [Crawford] I don't know
   if you told me everything.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:01.616
          Have a seat.

01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:05.220
               ¶¶

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.067
         Let's just get
   this thing over with, okay?

01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:20.802
    I mean, what do you guys
       want from me, huh?

01:07:20.804 --> 01:07:23.671
        I come down here
   in good faith to cooperate.

01:07:23.673 --> 01:07:28.176
 See, Sonny, I brought you down,
       'cause I wanna run
         an idea by you.

01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:31.312
           -An idea?
-I wanna come to you straight.

01:07:31.314 --> 01:07:35.150
 I don't buy that George Good's
     death was an accident.

01:07:35.152 --> 01:07:39.287
    Why? I already told you,
       I was right there.

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:42.157
    The tractor fell on him.
  Shit, it fell on both of us!

01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:45.226
  Look at my goddamn hand, man!
        I almost lost it!

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:46.828
      You think I would do
 something like this to myself?

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:48.763
        I've seen worse.
      You remember the guy

01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:50.765
     that shot his wife dead
  then shot himself in the hip,

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:53.568
         -talking about
       the burglar did it?
      -That's Danny Oakley.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:57.105
         Guys in prison
   call him Annie Oakley now.
       You can guess why.

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:03.078
             [beeps]

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:06.748
      Good luck with that.

01:08:10.287 --> 01:08:12.220
    Sonny, I waited till now
      to call you down here

01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:15.356
    'cause I was waiting for
 the medical examiner's report.

01:08:15.358 --> 01:08:17.392
              Yeah.
  Uh, they're always backed up.

01:08:17.394 --> 01:08:19.294
     They say it's funding.

01:08:19.296 --> 01:08:22.197
          -It's always
     about the money, right?
             -Yeah.

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:24.232
        What do you want
        to know from me?

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:26.434
   The medical examiner found
  some very interesting things

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.435
        about the wounds
       on Mr. Good's body.

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:31.171
  You see this photo right here
    on Mr. Good's collarbone?

01:08:31.174 --> 01:08:35.109
            -Mm-hmm.
          -Very unusual
       pattern right here.

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.580
  Temple, identical same wound,

01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:40.281
       and this is the one
        that killed him.

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:44.452
             There's
   the tractor's differential.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:45.752
      That part right there
         on the tractor

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:48.356
        is the only part
      whose shape matches,

01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:51.225
      identically matches,
      both of those wounds.

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.229
               So?

01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:57.599
         So the tractor
       fell on him twice.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.602
   Look, I don't know anything
     about that, all right?

01:09:00.604 --> 01:09:04.205
  Everything happened so fast.
And, remember, I was hurt, okay?

01:09:04.207 --> 01:09:07.408
          Look, maybe--
     maybe the thing bounced
    around a couple of times.

01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:08.910
 I was thinking the same thing.

01:09:08.912 --> 01:09:11.379
     Maybe the tractor fell,
     hit the floor so hard,

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:13.615
           it bounced
  and it hit them again twice.

01:09:13.617 --> 01:09:17.551
         -That's fair.
         -There you go.

01:09:17.554 --> 01:09:19.587
 Only the medical examiner says
    that that's not possible

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:21.256
      because of the depth
         of the wounds,

01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:23.791
         and is willing
  to testify in court to that.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:26.661
Well, maybe the medical examiner
     got it wrong this time.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.529
      The marks don't lie.

01:09:28.532 --> 01:09:29.898
         [Elias] Sonny.

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:34.169
            You know,
    a pretty woman like that

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:37.305
          can get a man
     to do a lot of things:

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:39.941
       lie, cheat, steal.

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:41.709
          -Maybe kill.
             -Yeah.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:44.912
              Huh.

01:09:44.915 --> 01:09:47.916
     A woman can get a man
     to do a lot of things.

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:51.685
         You know what?
        I'm done talking.

01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:54.522
       I'm done answering
         your questions,
      and I want a lawyer.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:55.890
            Hold on.
    You don't need a lawyer.

01:09:55.892 --> 01:09:57.926
          We won't ask
    any more questions, cool?

01:09:57.928 --> 01:10:00.295
     But wait a few minutes
      and then you can go.

01:10:00.297 --> 01:10:02.797
     -Give us a few minutes.
     -Just a couple minutes.

01:10:02.799 --> 01:10:04.766
         Couple minutes
      ain't gonna kill you.

01:10:04.768 --> 01:10:06.968
 Here's something to watch while
  you're waiting a few minutes.

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.636
   I'll give you two minutes.

01:10:08.638 --> 01:10:10.572
          That's cool.
 Fast forward to the good parts.

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:13.408
       We got two minutes.
      Just fast forward it.

01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:14.642
    Get it all ready for you.

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:16.711
           [Crawford]
    Oh, this is a good film.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:18.813
         -Look at this.
       -It's really good.

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:20.715
       [Crawford in video]
       Mr. Good was here,

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:22.684
          and the lever
       releasing the lift

01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:24.752
   was all the way over there.

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:26.721
  [Elias] No way he could pull
      the lever from here.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.690
     If nobody else was here
   to do it, how did it drop?

01:10:28.692 --> 01:10:30.325
            Exactly.

01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:32.293
           Unless this
  was really just an accident.

01:10:32.295 --> 01:10:34.662
 [Crawford] A mechanic could've
  rigged the locking mechanism.

01:10:34.664 --> 01:10:36.864
   But how did he pull the lever
    from all the way over here?

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:38.533
       Go Go Gadget arms?

01:10:42.639 --> 01:10:44.839
       What are you doing?

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:46.274
      [Crawford] What if...

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:48.710
             Watch.

01:10:56.786 --> 01:10:58.486
             Presto.

01:10:58.488 --> 01:11:00.521
        [Elias in video]
        All right, fine.

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:05.293
           -Cool, huh?
        -That's bullshit.

01:11:05.295 --> 01:11:06.861
      Now, it's either one
         of two things.

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:08.329
      Either you did it...

01:11:09.699 --> 01:11:13.368
      or you and Mrs. Good
        did it together.

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:16.771
  And when I find out which one
  it is, I'm coming to get you.

01:11:18.341 --> 01:11:19.974
       You can go for now.

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:29.784
            You know,
     it just occurred to me.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:31.586
         Didn't you need
      a warrant to do that?

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:35.857
          -Like this?
          -We knocked.

01:11:37.294 --> 01:11:38.493
             Twice.

01:11:39.529 --> 01:11:40.695
              Yeah.

01:11:42.332 --> 01:11:44.065
     [door opens and closes]

01:11:44.067 --> 01:11:45.700
            Goddamn.

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:49.003
   [Elias] We threw everything
         we had at him.

01:11:49.005 --> 01:11:50.905
        He didn't break.

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:53.007
        He didn't break,
       but maybe she will.

01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:55.643
You really think she's in on it?

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:57.378
       I can't wait to get
     Mata Hari in that chair

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.780
  and turn the heat up on her.

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:01.616
              Damn.

01:12:01.618 --> 01:12:02.950
           -You ready?
      -[George] I'm ready.

01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:04.585
           All right.

01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:05.753
              One.

01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:08.489
              Two.

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:09.757

       -[George groaning]
        -Pull the chain!

01:12:23.106 --> 01:12:25.540
    -[George] Pull the chain!
            -Pull it!

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:37.051
         Okay. Oh, God.
      That's it. That's it.

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:39.787
      -I'll get you out!
-I cannot hold it much longer!

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:41.389
            [George]
   What are you doing, Sonny?

01:12:41.391 --> 01:12:43.358
      -What are you doing?!
            -Let go!

01:12:45.729 --> 01:12:47.495
        [Sonny screaming]

01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:48.830
            Aah! Aah!

      [car engine running]

01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:53.401
            [Larissa]
  Why don't you say something?

01:12:53.403 --> 01:12:56.437
  Why don't you want to tell me
   what you and this detective
          talked about?

01:12:57.574 --> 01:13:00.074
       -[Sonny] Pull over.
        -[Larissa] What?

01:13:00.076 --> 01:13:04.445
     [Sonny] Just pull over!
            [panting]

01:13:11.087 --> 01:13:15.857
           -[coughing]
      -What's wrong, Sonny?

01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:18.793
       It's gonna be fine.

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.597
       I'm gonna be okay.

01:13:25.802 --> 01:13:27.135
   Everything's gonna be okay.

01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:34.609
That's what he said? It's either
     you or it's both of us?

01:13:35.779 --> 01:13:37.678
         Yeah, but they
      don't have anything.

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:44.152
 Nothing real, at least. They--
    they just got this video.

01:13:44.154 --> 01:13:46.988
          -What video?
  -It was this video that shows

01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:51.025
     how I could've dropped
 the tractor on George by myself

01:13:51.027 --> 01:13:52.927
         by tying a rope
       to the lift lever.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:57.999
    -Could that work for him?
   -No. It's just speculation.

01:13:58.001 --> 01:14:00.902
 -It wouldn't hold up in court.
             -Court.

01:14:00.904 --> 01:14:02.870
      I can't go to court.

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:05.573
   Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:09.043
  The more he talked, the more
   I realized he had nothing.

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:11.946
         Okay? Nothing.
       It's just a theory.

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:14.048
     But he knew the tractor
       was dropped twice.

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:16.050
            He thinks
    he knows a lot of things.

01:14:16.052 --> 01:14:19.020
      You think I would be
     sitting here right now

01:14:19.022 --> 01:14:20.221
   if they had anything on me?

01:14:20.223 --> 01:14:22.056
            You think
    they would let me leave?

01:14:22.058 --> 01:14:25.460
 No. He was just fucking with me
      to see how I'd react.

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:28.529
 You didn't freak out with them
      like you did with me
      in the car, did you?

01:14:28.531 --> 01:14:29.697
         No, I did not.

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:34.969
       [whispers] Oh, God.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:36.971
Sonny, are you gonna turn on me?

01:14:38.241 --> 01:14:40.575
             -What?
   -Are you gonna turn on me?

01:14:40.577 --> 01:14:43.678
         -Of course not.
     -Even if they offer you
       a lighter sentence?

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.513
      Why would you ask me
      something like that?

01:14:45.515 --> 01:14:47.949
     -Because if you are...
            -I'm not!

01:14:49.085 --> 01:14:50.852
         Okay? I'm not.

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:54.222
 Why? Are you gonna turn on me?

01:14:54.224 --> 01:14:55.890
           No. Never.

01:14:55.892 --> 01:14:58.793

        when people think

01:14:58.795 --> 01:15:01.662
        the other person
    is gonna screw them over,

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:03.931
    it's because they thought
       of doing it first.

01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:08.803

  you-- you think crazy things.

      on the phone for you.

    -Yes, uh, can you drop by

       tomorrow morning?

         and face them.

              -Shh.
    -I'm afraid. I'm afraid.

01:16:26.349 --> 01:16:28.215
   I'm afraid I won't be able
         to keep it up.

    I'm afraid I'm gonna say
        the wrong thing.

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:32.887
  It's just a game. That's how
you gotta look at it, as a game.

     -I know. We're gonna...

      I have to say to you.

01:17:45.762 --> 01:17:47.028
         You know I do.

01:17:53.069 --> 01:17:56.037
               ¶¶

01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:52.860
             [Sonny]
   It was my idea. All of it.

01:18:52.862 --> 01:18:55.830
            You see,
    I had a thing for Larissa

01:18:55.832 --> 01:18:57.998
         from the moment
  that George brought me home.

01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:02.403
   And one day, I made a move,

01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:04.905
         and she put me
     in my place right away.

01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:07.007
        She told me that
     she loved her husband,

01:19:07.009 --> 01:19:08.876
  and if I ever tried anything
         like that again

01:19:08.878 --> 01:19:12.246
   that she would let him know
       and have me fired.

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:15.116
     But I couldn't get her
         out of my mind.

01:19:15.118 --> 01:19:18.786
      So I started thinking
    that only if he was gone,

01:19:18.788 --> 01:19:23.524
      if-- if he was dead,
   then maybe I'd have a shot.

01:19:26.028 --> 01:19:29.363
    I set it up. And as soon
     as she went into town,

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:31.899
      I had George help me
       under the tractor.

01:19:31.901 --> 01:19:33.768
   And just like you figured,

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:35.836
 I tied a rope around the lever,
        and I pulled it.

01:19:38.174 --> 01:19:40.207
          And I thought
    if I got my hand get hurt

01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:43.410
   then you would never think
     it wasn't an accident.

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:47.281
       But it was all me.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:50.885
Mrs. Good had absolutely nothing
         to do with it.

 Well, I got to hand it to you,
 you had it figured all along.

       -You got your guy.

01:20:17.346 --> 01:20:20.347
         Yeah? I wonder.

       -See you tomorrow.
       -See you tomorrow.

   by the time you read this,

01:20:36.399 --> 01:20:38.299
        I've already done
        what I had to do.

01:20:38.301 --> 01:20:40.601
         I've confessed
       to killing George.

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:43.370
         You were right.

01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:46.340
     The police aren't gonna
     let George's death go.

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:48.242
        They're gonna be
       on us every minute,

01:20:48.244 --> 01:20:49.977
    and the last thing I want

01:20:49.979 --> 01:20:52.613
     is for them to find out
     that you were involved,

01:20:52.615 --> 01:20:56.217
         especially now
       with a baby coming.

01:20:56.219 --> 01:21:00.154
I told you once that I would die
  before I saw a child of mine

01:21:00.156 --> 01:21:03.123
       end up in the care
    of the state like I was.

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:05.092
     And if the police think
      that you're involved,

01:21:05.094 --> 01:21:07.628
         that's exactly
        what will happen.

01:21:07.630 --> 01:21:11.432
       It wouldn't be good
   if both our baby's parents
          were in jail.

01:21:11.434 --> 01:21:15.169
     I knew what I had to do
     the moment you told me
       you were pregnant.

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.240
   You must sell the farm now

01:21:19.242 --> 01:21:21.342
          and move away
     where no one knows you.

01:21:21.344 --> 01:21:25.346
      You don't want people
        to start talking
     when they see our son.

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:27.615
  And don't try to contact me.

01:21:27.617 --> 01:21:30.885
    Someday, when I'm finally
settled wherever they send me...

01:21:30.887 --> 01:21:32.353
          [slam echoes]

01:21:32.355 --> 01:21:34.321
     we'll find a safe way
     for you to let me know

01:21:34.323 --> 01:21:37.491
      how you and our baby
           are doing.

01:21:37.493 --> 01:21:39.159
     I just need you to know

01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:42.029
      that when I told you
      I loved you, Larissa,

01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:43.564
           I meant it.

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:44.932
     Take care of yourself.

01:21:44.934 --> 01:21:46.634
   And take care of our baby.

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:50.004
    And P.S., if it's a boy,

01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:53.207
          I'd like you
       to name him Brandon

01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:55.309
   in honor of my grandfather.

01:21:55.311 --> 01:21:59.313
         If it's a girl,
    well, you pick the name."

01:22:16.198 --> 01:22:18.666
            [Larissa]
       "My dearest, Sonny,

01:22:18.668 --> 01:22:21.535
I think about you all the time.

01:22:21.537 --> 01:22:24.505
         Our little boy
       is growing so fast,

01:22:24.507 --> 01:22:26.707
you would hardly recognize him.

01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:30.411
   He's very happy and bright
   and, just like his father,

01:22:30.413 --> 01:22:32.613
    very good with his hands,

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:35.015
        putting together
      his toys and puzzles.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:38.052
You would be very proud of him.

01:22:38.721 --> 01:22:41.255
          Love always."

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:47.194
            [Sonny]
  "Sweetheart, your last letter
  lifted my spirits to the sky.

01:22:47.196 --> 01:22:50.998
  I'm glad things are going so
good for you and little Brandon.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.501
  I'm glad to hear our baby boy
        is doing so well.

01:22:54.503 --> 01:22:58.339
   It seems so long since you
   sent me a picture of him.

01:22:58.341 --> 01:23:02.109
   Every time you do, he seems
   to grow and change so much.

01:23:02.111 --> 01:23:05.479
   Sometimes he looks like me,
          and sometimes
       he looks like you.

01:23:05.481 --> 01:23:11.185
    I'd like to see at least
   one more picture of our son
    before my time runs out.

01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:13.287
      All my heart, Sonny."

01:23:33.209 --> 01:23:34.508
        Mail, Mrs. Good.

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:37.211
   [Larissa] Thank you, Dinah.

01:23:37.213 --> 01:23:40.748
        Did you bring in
       those family photos
     for our employee wall?

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:42.316
       Uh, yes, Mrs. Good.

01:23:42.318 --> 01:23:45.152
   [race cars buzzing outside]

01:23:46.789 --> 01:23:48.722
             -Here.
           -Thank you.

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:53.627
              Wow.
   What a handsome little boy.

01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:56.797
 -He's my heart. My little Troy.
              -Hmm.

01:23:56.799 --> 01:24:00.067
      -How old is he again?
         -Uh, he's five.

01:24:01.637 --> 01:24:04.138
      -So big for his age.
            -Mm-hmm.

01:24:05.408 --> 01:24:07.141
       -Thank you, Dinah.
           -Of course.

01:24:19.655 --> 01:24:21.388
    [man with Russian accent]
         Another letter?

01:24:22.358 --> 01:24:25.192
    He doesn't quit, does he?

01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:27.561
        Well, if he does,
    he might start thinking,

01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:29.763
      and we don't want him
        thinking, do we?

01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:37.137
       Could you please go
          and make sure

01:24:37.139 --> 01:24:39.206
   the Lamborghini gets ready
        for next client?

01:24:40.209 --> 01:24:42.176
             [Sonny]
    Son of a bitch! Come on!

01:24:42.178 --> 01:24:46.080
   Last time, they screwed up
     and cost me two grand.

01:24:46.082 --> 01:24:48.682
       Okay. Later, boss.

01:24:59.295 --> 01:25:04.298

01:25:30.226 --> 01:25:32.259
            [warden]
        Sonny, it's time.

01:25:41.604 --> 01:25:43.537
    [Larissa] "Dearest Sonny,

01:25:43.539 --> 01:25:45.506
 you can't know how much I wish

01:25:45.508 --> 01:25:47.508
            you were
     right here with us now.

01:25:48.878 --> 01:25:51.678
    Because of your strength
       and your sacrifice,

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.883
    our son is growing strong
          and healthy,

01:25:55.885 --> 01:25:58.352
   and one day I will tell him

01:25:58.354 --> 01:26:00.387
       all the good things
        about his daddy.

01:26:01.524 --> 01:26:03.457
           He will be
      starting school soon,

01:26:03.459 --> 01:26:06.393
   and he is just the smartest
    little boy you ever saw.

01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:08.362
          All my love."

01:26:08.364 --> 01:26:11.231
       [race cars buzzing]

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:19.806
      [inmate] You're going
    to a better world, Sonny.
