47:35.153 --> 47:37.386
I mean,
choppers and assault rifles.

47:37.388 --> 47:40.156
In that case, we'll hightail it
to our escape route,

47:40.158 --> 47:43.059
which will be here, like this.

47:43.061 --> 47:45.394
You two will be
front-of-house here,

47:45.396 --> 47:48.197
while the young fella and I
will be on gold duties.

47:48.199 --> 47:50.166
I'm supposed to be on the gold.

47:50.168 --> 47:53.002
You'll be front-of-house,
alright?

47:53.004 --> 47:55.404
If you don't mind,
I want Josh on the gold.

47:55.406 --> 47:56.939
I do mind.

47:59.978 --> 48:02.945
In the light
of certain concessions...

48:04.983 --> 48:06.616
Fuck sake. Alright.

48:06.618 --> 48:09.585
Once we're in, JR,
you'll be here with Sterlo.

48:09.587 --> 48:12.088
- Don't cry.
- Something goes wrong...

48:12.090 --> 48:14.390
- What did you say?
- I said, 'Don't cry.'

48:14.392 --> 48:17.927
Come here. Come here,
you little fucking prick!

48:20.598 --> 48:23.599
Get some drinks. Go and get
some fucking drinks. Go.

48:23.601 --> 48:25.902
Fucking idiot. Yeah.

48:27.939 --> 48:30.139
Bad Girls

48:30.141 --> 48:32.408
¶ Get down

48:32.410 --> 48:35.912
¶ Pull me closer
if you think you can hang

48:35.914 --> 48:39.148
¶ Hands up, hands tied

48:39.150 --> 48:42.184
¶ Don't go screamin'
if I blow you with a bang

48:42.186 --> 48:44.253
¶ Ahh, Suki Zuki

48:44.255 --> 48:46.322
¶ I'm comin' in the Cherokee

48:46.324 --> 48:47.957
¶ Gasoline

48:47.959 --> 48:49.625
¶ There's steam
on the window screen

48:49.627 --> 48:51.327
¶ Take it, take it

48:51.329 --> 48:53.429
¶ Wheels bouncing
like a trampoline

48:53.431 --> 48:56.432
¶ When I get to where I'm going,
gonna have you tremblin' ¶

48:58.136 --> 48:59.635
Hey, how about a lap dance?

48:59.637 --> 49:01.604
I'll get one of the girls.

49:01.606 --> 49:04.373
- We want you.
- Get your hands off me!

49:04.375 --> 49:07.677
Oi! Get your hands off her.
You heard what she said.

49:07.679 --> 49:10.112
- What are you, her manager?
- Really? See this?

49:10.114 --> 49:11.681
- You see this?
- Yeah.

49:11.683 --> 49:14.016
- Walk away. Fuck off.
- Yeah, we get it.

49:14.018 --> 49:16.519
¶ When I'm bangin' on my radio

49:16.521 --> 49:18.187
¶ Back it, back it

49:18.189 --> 49:19.588
¶ Yeah, pull up
to the bumper game... ¶

49:19.590 --> 49:21.190
Tasha.

49:21.192 --> 49:24.193
I suppose you think
that was smart.

49:24.195 --> 49:27.730
- What if they call the police?
- I can handle that.

49:27.732 --> 49:29.632
I can't.

49:31.703 --> 49:36.372
You're right. I'm an idiot.
I'm sorry.

49:38.476 --> 49:41.177
Wanna go for coffee
or something?

49:43.748 --> 49:47.583
- Sam wouldn't like it.
- Fuck Sam.

49:53.725 --> 49:56.292
Near your place, there's
a footbridge to the beach.

49:56.294 --> 49:58.327
- Know it?
- Yeah.

49:58.329 --> 50:00.629
I'm off at eight.
I'll meet you there.

50:17.482 --> 50:19.615
What are you doing?

50:37.035 --> 50:39.068
- Oh, fuck!
- Come.

50:39.070 --> 50:41.270
- Fuck!
- Come, it's OK.

50:44.509 --> 50:47.576
Why couldn't we do this
in a restaurant?

50:49.080 --> 50:51.380
Too many people!
- Shit!

50:51.382 --> 50:53.282
This is more relaxing.

50:54.252 --> 50:58.120
Relaxing? Really?

50:58.122 --> 51:00.256
As soon as you get out
far enough,

51:00.258 --> 51:01.824
it's not a problem anymore.

51:01.826 --> 51:04.627
It's a problem for me.

51:04.629 --> 51:06.796
- I can't...
- It's OK. It's OK.

51:06.798 --> 51:08.464
It's fine.

51:12.737 --> 51:16.439
When I was a kid, I hadn't
quite learnt to swim yet.

51:16.441 --> 51:19.508
And my dad gets this stupid idea
in his head

51:19.510 --> 51:23.212
that the best way to learn
is to chuck me overboard.

51:24.715 --> 51:27.650
- And?
- I drowned.

51:29.353 --> 51:31.454
Seriously, my heart stopped.

51:32.623 --> 51:35.424
What was it like?

51:35.426 --> 51:38.194
Once you stop thinking about it,
it's...

51:39.797 --> 51:41.831
..it's kind of peaceful.

52:41.759 --> 52:45.628
Two blonde children.

52:45.630 --> 52:48.497
I just liked them
because they looked happy.

52:48.499 --> 52:50.499
It's not real.

52:52.236 --> 52:54.236
It's real for someone, isn't it?

52:54.238 --> 52:58.641
I don't know.
You ever met a family like that?

53:04.248 --> 53:06.448
Me either.

53:08.286 --> 53:09.852
What's this anyway?

53:11.289 --> 53:12.621
A goodluck charm.

53:13.891 --> 53:16.392
How's that been working out
for you?

53:17.428 --> 53:21.297
Not so great... until now.

53:27.905 --> 53:32.241
It... it says...

53:35.346 --> 53:39.782
'Things are not as you imagine.'

53:40.918 --> 53:42.284
Really?

53:44.522 --> 53:47.523
I think they generally are,
though.

53:47.525 --> 53:53.796
What if I'm working for Sam,
trying to win your confidence?

53:55.266 --> 53:57.299
Find your weakness.

53:57.301 --> 53:59.935
You can tell Sam all about it if
you like. I don't give a fuck.

53:59.937 --> 54:01.904
We're gonna get that gold.

54:01.906 --> 54:04.740
I'll get my share, then you and
me are gonna run off together.

54:04.742 --> 54:09.311
Sure. Like that's gonna happen.

54:13.851 --> 54:18.320
Just pack your bags
and be ready. OK?

54:24.729 --> 54:30.766
Oh. What the fuck is this?
All you had to be was on time.

54:30.768 --> 54:32.334
I know. I'm sorry I'm late.

54:32.336 --> 54:34.216
There's no margin
for error here.

54:39.610 --> 54:40.909
That'll do, eh?

54:47.918 --> 54:52.521
Do you ever wonder, what if
it doesn't all go to plan?

54:52.523 --> 54:54.456
Let me ask you something, kid.

54:54.458 --> 54:56.625
You think Danny Green ever
thinks about losing a fight?

54:56.627 --> 54:59.295
- Hm?
- Guess not.

54:59.297 --> 55:01.797
Of course he fucking does.

55:01.799 --> 55:04.466
But what he knows
is he's a tough prick.

55:04.468 --> 55:06.568
He's got a trainer
who'll look after him.

55:06.570 --> 55:08.671
And Brendan's the only bloke
I know

55:08.673 --> 55:11.807
who's been blessed by fairies.

55:11.809 --> 55:14.743
If you want proof of that,
you take a fucking look at me.

55:14.745 --> 55:18.914
I got three life sentences.
Three of the fuckers.

55:18.916 --> 55:21.817
Here I am, free as a bird,
doing what I like best.

55:24.555 --> 55:27.956
You follow Brendan...
Look at me.

55:27.958 --> 55:31.493
You follow Brendan
and guaran-fucking-teed,

55:31.495 --> 55:33.595
that's where the pot of gold
will be.

55:35.032 --> 55:38.434
Except you both
ended up in prison.

55:41.872 --> 55:45.908
¶ INTRIGUING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC

55:52.717 --> 55:54.483
Paperwork and ID, boys.

56:06.397 --> 56:08.397
- All good, guys.
- OK.

56:08.399 --> 56:09.665
Cheers.

56:33.491 --> 56:35.157
Bingo.

56:35.159 --> 56:36.525
Oh!

56:38.696 --> 56:41.096
Come on, just stick to
the game plan. You'll do fine.

56:42.099 --> 56:43.866
Hey, you can do this.

56:46.670 --> 56:47.836
Alright?

¶ INTENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC

57:45.796 --> 57:49.097
OK, I see it.

58:01.879 --> 58:03.745
I'm in position.

58:03.747 --> 58:07.616
Alright, just hold tight.
Only a few hours to go.

58:08.752 --> 58:10.519
Fuck! Fuck!

58:10.521 --> 58:13.188
Brendan, you there?

58:13.190 --> 58:15.657
Fuck!

58:15.659 --> 58:18.760
- What's going on?
- I just dropped my torch.

58:18.762 --> 58:22.931
- Will they see it?
- - I don't know.

58:22.933 --> 58:25.667
Well, will they see it or not?
You're the one in the vent.

58:25.669 --> 58:28.737
- It's your call.

58:30.541 --> 58:33.075
Fuck!

58:33.077 --> 58:36.078
I'm here now. Keep going.
Keep going.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.846
Alright.

58:53.864 --> 58:56.832
Is everything OK?

58:56.834 --> 58:59.067
It's all fine.

59:08.078 --> 59:13.282
- What did he tell you?
- Like you said.

59:13.284 --> 59:17.753
He wants to take his share, then
him and me to run off together.

59:17.755 --> 59:20.122
Did you fuck him?

59:20.124 --> 59:22.758
I told him it was too dangerous.

59:26.263 --> 59:28.130
That's my girl.

59:33.170 --> 59:34.303
Goodnight, Sam.

59:47.751 --> 59:51.353
Right. Remember, stick together,
stay in contact.

59:51.355 --> 59:56.258
And if you have to shoot,
shoot their legs, OK?

01:00:24.922 --> 01:00:26.622
Yo?

01:00:26.624 --> 01:00:28.657
Someone called
a faulty monitor?

01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:31.893
- It wasn't me, mate.
- Well, someone did, mate.

- Clear.

You? You're the manager?

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:02.451
There's three responses -
'yes', 'no', or 'I'm not sure'.

01:02:02.453 --> 01:02:05.253
- Yeah, I'm the manager.
- Get up, go! Take this one!

Take my hand. Come on, it's OK.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:15.297
Alright, start the pour,
just as you always do.

head down!

Don't use my name, you fuck!

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:24.506
You've been demoted.
Now stay here.

01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:25.907
- I didn't!
- Stay here!

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:27.375
I didn't! Fuck!

01:02:27.377 --> 01:02:29.978
Go, go, go! Start the pour!
Come on!

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.347
Keep your fucking eyes on 'em.
Keep your eyes on 'em!

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:34.082
Don't fucking look at me!

Eyes to the ground now!

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.053
Keep your fuckin' head down!

01:02:38.055 --> 01:02:40.856
- Kid, keep your eyes on him!
- You alright?

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:50.832
Is it four or five minutes
to set?

01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:53.535
Uh, five minutes.

01:02:53.537 --> 01:02:56.171
You fucking idiot!

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:59.875
Watch them.
What the fuck is going on here?

01:02:59.877 --> 01:03:01.176
He was going for the door!

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:06.014
Ah! Fuck!

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:08.250
- Alright, alright.

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:12.420
Stop your bleating. We have to
keep the pressure on, alright?

01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:14.523
I'm gonna tighten it now.
One, two, three.

01:03:16.393 --> 01:03:19.194
Your job is to keep that tight.
Keep pressure there.

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:21.530
Babysit this piece of shit,
will you?

01:03:21.532 --> 01:03:23.565
If he tries anything,
fucking shoot him!

01:03:23.567 --> 01:03:26.401
Don't turn your back on them.
Never turn your fucking back.

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:28.937
- You're fucking dead!
- Shut up!

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:31.840
Put your fucking mask back on,
dickhead.

01:03:31.842 --> 01:03:33.441
- I didn't...
- Shut up!

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:37.879
Hey, boys, the Jacks are onto
us. The airways have lit up.

01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:45.287
Switch to plan B.
OK, cool 'em down.

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:48.423
Move! Move! Move! Move!

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:53.094
Come on,
let's fucking move! Move!

01:03:53.096 --> 01:03:54.896
OK, come on, let's go.

01:03:54.898 --> 01:03:56.531
- Join the others.
- We've got them.

01:03:56.533 --> 01:03:58.266
- Come and get us.
<i>- On my way.</i>

01:03:58.268 --> 01:04:01.536
- OK, let's do it.
- Go get the other bag.

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:03.205
Let's go, come on.

01:04:03.207 --> 01:04:05.574
Move, move, move.
Go, go!

01:04:05.576 --> 01:04:08.877
Don't shoot!
They've got guns!

01:04:08.879 --> 01:04:12.013
Don't shoot! They've got guns!
They've got guns!

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:15.217
- Don't shoot!
- Hold your fire!

01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:19.354
Don't shoot!
They've got fucking guns!

01:04:32.603 --> 01:04:34.035
Fucking move!

01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:43.011
- Let's go! Come on!
- Move!

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:46.281
OK, go!

01:05:00.163 --> 01:05:02.364

01:25:59.355 --> 01:26:01.655
That's from Sam.

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:03.657
It's just a key.

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:06.493
Yeah, it's a key.
It's a key to the gold.

01:26:09.231 --> 01:26:10.697
The gold where?

01:26:10.699 --> 01:26:12.466
Watch this.

01:26:40.429 --> 01:26:42.529
Ken!

01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:44.398
Come on, Ken!

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.233
Come out with your fucking
hands up!

01:26:46.235 --> 01:26:48.202
I know you're there, mate.
Come on, Ken!

01:26:48.204 --> 01:26:50.337
Come out!

01:26:56.645 --> 01:26:58.378
Check the driver.

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:01.415
Oh, Josh, Josh.

01:27:01.417 --> 01:27:02.916
What were you handing over?

01:27:02.918 --> 01:27:04.618
Where's the fucking gold?

01:27:05.788 --> 01:27:07.554
He gave him this.

01:27:09.592 --> 01:27:11.858
Alright, he's alive.
Get him in the van.

01:27:14.697 --> 01:27:17.331
Get off me! Fuck!

01:27:19.802 --> 01:27:22.336
Fuck! What the fuck, Wayne?

01:27:22.338 --> 01:27:23.971
You're working for Sam,
aren't you?

01:27:23.973 --> 01:27:25.672
He got a better offer.

01:27:27.376 --> 01:27:31.845
Josh, where is my gold?

01:27:33.382 --> 01:27:34.815
Go fuck yourself.

01:27:36.318 --> 01:27:40.020
Give me a fucking hammer
or something.

01:27:40.022 --> 01:27:42.923
What I can't stand
is all the shouting, you know?

01:27:42.925 --> 01:27:45.892
'Oh, please don't...
don't hurt me. Oh, no, no.

01:27:45.894 --> 01:27:48.395
No, please, no, not the thumbs,
not the thumbs.

01:27:48.397 --> 01:27:50.464
I'm just learning the piano.'

01:27:50.466 --> 01:27:52.699
- No, wait. No, wait!
- See?

01:27:52.701 --> 01:27:55.802
- We haven't even started yet.
- Don't do it. Fuck off!

01:27:55.804 --> 01:27:58.472
I reckon he'd be quieter...

01:27:58.474 --> 01:28:00.007
..in that freezer.

01:28:00.009 --> 01:28:03.410
- What?
- Wayne...

01:28:03.412 --> 01:28:05.846
..you're a fucking genius.

01:28:05.848 --> 01:28:08.548
- Put him in the freezer.
- No. Fuck off.

01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:10.851
- Go on.
- No! Fuck off! Don't!

01:28:10.853 --> 01:28:12.619
Let go of me!

01:28:18.994 --> 01:28:22.529
How long does it take
for hypothermia to kick in?

01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:26.633
Alright, let him out.

01:28:36.078 --> 01:28:39.446
Right, then.
Let's try this again.

01:28:40.582 --> 01:28:43.850
Where is my gold, Josh?

01:28:43.852 --> 01:28:45.619
I can't straighten my legs.

01:28:45.621 --> 01:28:48.588
Shall I get Wayne to straighten
it with a hammer?

01:28:50.059 --> 01:28:51.792
Where's my fucking gold, Josh?

01:28:51.794 --> 01:28:53.560
Get fucked.

01:28:58.901 --> 01:29:00.600
No. Don't.

01:29:00.602 --> 01:29:02.803
No, please, don't.

01:29:02.805 --> 01:29:04.771
Please don't, don't.

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:28.995
We're not home yet.

01:29:28.997 --> 01:29:31.098
Still got to get it
out of the country.

01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:35.535
But first we've got some
unfinished business back west.

01:29:39.408 --> 01:29:43.143
Here you are.
Thank you.

01:29:43.145 --> 01:29:45.645
Here are your tickets.
Enjoy your flight.

01:29:45.647 --> 01:29:47.607
God bless you. Thank you.
Go on, son.

01:30:00.863 --> 01:30:02.996
Who moved this?

01:30:02.998 --> 01:30:05.065
Who moved this?!

01:30:07.002 --> 01:30:08.702
I did.

01:30:19.848 --> 01:30:22.983
I wasn't expecting any honour
amongst thieves here,

01:30:22.985 --> 01:30:25.852
but I am not sensing
much remorse, Sam.

01:30:28.023 --> 01:30:29.723
It's business.

01:30:33.095 --> 01:30:34.895
No place for sentiments.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:46.540
Couldn't agree more.

01:31:04.593 --> 01:31:06.493
That's alright.
Keep the change.

01:31:06.495 --> 01:31:08.028
Thank you.

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:33.186
43.

01:31:35.524 --> 01:31:38.758
- OK, number 43.
- No worries.

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.527
You're right.

01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:54.074
Where were you?

01:31:54.076 --> 01:31:56.042
Just getting a chocolate bar.

01:31:57.679 --> 01:31:59.279
Do you want some?

01:31:59.281 --> 01:32:01.715
They give you pimples.

01:32:06.722 --> 01:32:08.255
- Come on.

01:32:08.257 --> 01:32:09.990
Going to see a man about a boat.

01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:18.632
That's her ahead!

01:32:21.737 --> 01:32:24.137
Is she any good in a storm?

01:32:24.139 --> 01:32:27.307
Depends how good a sailor
you are.

01:32:27.309 --> 01:32:30.710
Took me to Java ten years ago
single-handed.

01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:33.613
Up the Whitsundays
every Christmas with the wife

01:32:33.615 --> 01:32:34.981
while she was still up to it.

01:32:34.983 --> 01:32:36.983
How much do you want
for her?

01:32:36.985 --> 01:32:40.287
The wife? She's not much chop
since she caught Alzheimer's.

01:32:40.289 --> 01:32:43.590
- No, the boat, mate.
- Price is on the advert.

01:32:43.592 --> 01:32:46.793
I already turned down 75
for her.

01:32:46.795 --> 01:32:51.731
What would you say to 80,
cash in hand?

01:32:53.969 --> 01:32:55.702
You're on.

01:33:05.881 --> 01:33:07.347
Whoa!

01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:12.018
I told you to sit
where I could see you.

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:14.020
- I'm just watching TV.
- Sit there.

01:33:18.193 --> 01:33:20.827
- Sit there.
- Jeez.

01:33:28.837 --> 01:33:31.605
Better.

01:33:31.607 --> 01:33:33.173
Fuck.

01:33:43.685 --> 01:33:45.251
Wake up.

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:51.825
It's time to go.

01:34:12.814 --> 01:34:14.381
We're all set.

01:34:23.892 --> 01:34:28.795
I'm sorry, kid. This is
the end of the line for you.

01:34:28.797 --> 01:34:30.797
I don't want your death
on my conscience,

01:34:30.799 --> 01:34:32.666
so I was thinking...

01:34:32.668 --> 01:34:35.168
What's a fair price
for a young bloke like you?

01:34:35.170 --> 01:34:39.773
And I came up with half a bar -
350.

01:34:39.775 --> 01:34:43.109
Half of 4 million
is 2 million.

01:34:43.111 --> 01:34:46.680
- What are you smiling at?
- Nothing.

01:34:46.682 --> 01:34:49.015
What would you do with
that kind of money anyway?

01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:51.151
Buy a boat, maybe.

01:34:51.153 --> 01:34:53.286
Your book makes it sound
pretty easy.

01:34:56.324 --> 01:34:58.291
Where did you get that?

01:34:58.293 --> 01:35:00.160
The flat in Melbourne.

01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:08.134
You fucking used me.

01:35:08.136 --> 01:35:11.705
I'm offering you
350,000 fucking dollars!

01:35:11.707 --> 01:35:13.773
You don't have
that kind of money anymore.

01:35:13.775 --> 01:35:15.775
What?

01:35:17.746 --> 01:35:19.312
Fucking what?

01:35:34.796 --> 01:35:36.362
Fuck.

01:35:38.333 --> 01:35:40.266
Fuck.

01:35:40.268 --> 01:35:42.235
Right.

01:35:42.237 --> 01:35:44.771
I'll only ask you this
fucking once.

01:35:48.944 --> 01:35:51.745
- That'll be for you.
- Where is the gold?!

01:35:51.747 --> 01:35:53.413
Answer it.

01:35:53.415 --> 01:35:55.849
- Son of Sorrow.
- What?

01:35:55.851 --> 01:35:57.784
No half measures, right?

01:35:57.786 --> 01:35:59.986
If you shoot me,
she'll call the cops.

01:36:01.223 --> 01:36:02.922
Answer it!

01:36:06.461 --> 01:36:09.129
If you want to see
your half of the gold <i>,</i>

01:36:09.131 --> 01:36:10.830
do what he says.

01:36:14.202 --> 01:36:16.936
- Where were you?
- Getting a chocolate bar.

01:36:21.443 --> 01:36:24.244
<i>Things are not as you imagine.</i>

01:36:28.383 --> 01:36:30.884
OK, number 43.

01:36:30.886 --> 01:36:33.419
<i>You were right.</i>

01:36:33.421 --> 01:36:35.488
<i>Never trust a woman.</i>

01:36:35.490 --> 01:36:37.257
<i>Checkmate.</i>

01:36:43.965 --> 01:36:46.266
Fuck!

01:36:46.268 --> 01:36:47.967
Fuck!

01:37:20.869 --> 01:37:22.435
Fuck.

01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:51.564
Come on!

01:38:15.090 --> 01:38:17.056
Didn't it occur to you

01:38:17.058 --> 01:38:19.459
that she could just run off
with all the fucking gold?

01:38:22.998 --> 01:38:24.564
You know what?

01:38:26.201 --> 01:38:27.667
It didn't.

01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:29.936
What a fucking idiot.

01:38:30.639 --> 01:38:32.372
I'm a bonobo.

01:38:32.374 --> 01:38:35.275
Oh, am I a fucking chimp?

01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:40.680
Keep the phone.

01:38:40.682 --> 01:38:43.616
I'll call you and let you know
where you can find your half.
