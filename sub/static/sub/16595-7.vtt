WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:06.004
Uh, yeah,
so, Reverend,

00:06.006 --> 00:09.541
I was looking over the readings
you suggested,

00:09.543 --> 00:13.178
and they're coming off
a little...preachy.

00:13.180 --> 00:17.349
Um, I have some tweaks.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.884
On the Bible?

00:18.886 --> 00:20.385
(chuckles)

00:20.387 --> 00:22.254
Mike, your daughter
wants to rewrite God.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.756
Mandy, let's not get too hung up
on the words.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.793
No one's gonna be listening
to the reverend anyway.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.663
Well, I see
where she gets her charm.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.065
Because everyone
will be looking

00:33.067 --> 00:34.533
at the most beautiful
bride ever.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.536
So beautiful.
Way more beautiful than I was.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.004
You're right.
Thank you.

00:39.006 --> 00:41.406
Um, that's fine.
We can keep them for now.

00:41.408 --> 00:43.375
But these pews -- ew.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.444
They're a little pewy.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.212
Okay. You know --

00:47.214 --> 00:49.448
If it makes God feel any better,
she criticizes my house, too.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.552
I've got a funeral tomorrow,
and I hate to say this,

00:53.554 --> 00:55.520
but I'm actually
looking forward to it.

00:55.522 --> 00:59.191
Big life changes
tend to freak Mandy out

00:59.193 --> 01:01.126
more than most people.

01:01.128 --> 01:02.694
Boy, I remember
preschool.

01:02.696 --> 01:05.464
It was a flood
of hysterical tears.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.899
I'm guessing
from the teacher?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.569
Over the next
couple of days,

01:10.571 --> 01:13.472
I got to fix everything
that might set her off.

01:13.474 --> 01:17.376
It's like defusing a bomb
but not as much fun.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.644
Okay.
But you owe me.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.145
We have a church
canoe expedition,

01:20.147 --> 01:21.480
and we need
a trip leader.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.314
All right.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.749
And canoes.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.751
Okay,
but I'm gonna expect

01:25.753 --> 01:28.287
a little heavier pour
this communion.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.855
You got it?

01:30.624 --> 01:31.723
Hey, Mandy.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.625
Hey, I know you said
you didn't need me here,

01:33.627 --> 01:36.161
but I just want to show you what
me and my best man just got.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.129
Okay, can it wait?

01:37.131 --> 01:38.764
'Cause I'm really busy
right now?

01:38.766 --> 01:40.565
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
he's excited.

01:40.567 --> 01:41.833
Let the young man
speak.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.168
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
One sec.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.737
Um, uh, sorry, Reverend,
one quick thing.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.006
During the ceremony,
I'm going to be standing here

01:48.008 --> 01:49.908
so that nobody
can see my bad side,

01:49.910 --> 01:50.942
which isn't really bad.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.311
It's just less good.
See?

01:52.313 --> 01:53.145
Yay.

01:53.147 --> 01:53.979
Nay.

01:53.981 --> 01:54.813
Yay.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.649
Nay.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.850
That's my spot.

01:58.852 --> 02:01.420
So, nay.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.255
Excuse me, Reverend.
Excuse me for a second.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.857
Have you ever read
this passage here,

02:05.859 --> 02:08.660
"Thou shall not
dig in thy heels"?

02:10.698 --> 02:13.098
Okay. Okay.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.333
I can be flexible.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.435
Just like
our new church raft.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.538
Can I show you now?

02:19.540 --> 02:21.273
Yeah, sure.
You got one minute. Mm-hmm.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.307
A whole minute.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.308
Well, Mandy,
when you give,

02:23.310 --> 02:25.110
you give with both hands,
don't you?

02:25.112 --> 02:28.647
Okay. So, Ed and I were at
the mall, picking up our suits.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.849
Mm-hmm. Well, actually, no.
First we got a Jamba Juice.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.785
Oh, and news flash --
I like mango now.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.387
Fine.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.655
Take us home, Kyle.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.457
Right.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.859
Anyway, so, we found the perfect
shoes to wear with our tuxes.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.462
Great.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.197
High tops!

02:50.838 --> 02:52.170
You're speechless.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.706
See, Ed, I told you
she'd love them.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.375
I do not deserve her.

02:56.377 --> 02:59.544
(chuckles)
That's something you say.

02:59.546 --> 03:03.081
Let's leave before
she regains her speech.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.850
-Uh, Mandy, honey.
-Huh?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.151
A-Are you with us?

03:06.153 --> 03:08.487
No. I'm gonna lose it.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.555
Okay, all right.
Don't worry. Don't worry.

03:10.557 --> 03:12.691
Your dad is gonna fix
the whole shoe thing.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.159
My pleasure.
My pleasure.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.597
Looky there,
I just lied in church.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.741
Well, how's
the best-man toast coming?

03:29.743 --> 03:31.610
Not great. No.

03:31.612 --> 03:35.714
Normally, I'd open with a joke
about a wild bachelor party.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.417
But Kyle's was
at Dave & Buster's.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.552
Well, who needs
a topless stripper

03:40.554 --> 03:42.988
when you've got
bottomless tater tots?

03:44.124 --> 03:46.258
Listen, I'm looking for Kyle.
You know where he is?

03:46.260 --> 03:47.626
Mandy doesn't really
want you guys

03:47.628 --> 03:49.027
wearing sneakers
at the wedding.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.929
Uh, the store
won't take them back, Mike.

03:50.931 --> 03:54.399
You know, the kid
jumped in a puddle.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.636
Why are you letting Mandy
act like this?

03:57.638 --> 03:59.304
Because it's
her wedding, Ed.

03:59.306 --> 04:01.273
Weddings are
about the bride, right?

04:01.275 --> 04:03.108
Well, it's Kyle's
wedding, too,

04:03.110 --> 04:05.310
and frankly, you know,
Mandy's behavior

04:05.312 --> 04:07.813
throughout all this
is reminding me of someone.

04:07.815 --> 04:08.980
Oh?

04:08.982 --> 04:10.115
Me.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.384
Well, I can see that.

04:12.386 --> 04:15.420
You both
make me miserable.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.256
All of my relationships,
I was the selfish one.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.059
Over the years, it ruined
each of my marriages.

04:21.061 --> 04:25.063
Right, but Mandy's
not "you" bad.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.965
You know I love her,
but I'm Kyle's best man,

04:26.967 --> 04:28.900
and the sneakers
are very important to him.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.669
You can't let Kyle
wear whatever he wants.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.472
He'll come dressed
like Spider-Man.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.973
He should get
something he wants.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.741
She shot down
all his other ideas,

04:36.743 --> 04:38.944
like having the wedding here
at Outdoor Man.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.946
You know
that Mandy loves Kyle.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.080
Yeah.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.482
She just doesn't
want you guys

04:43.484 --> 04:45.684
wearing clown shoes
at a wedding.

04:45.686 --> 04:48.119
I don't think
it's that big of a deal.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.321
Well, it is to me.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.856
I mean, she's telling him

04:50.858 --> 04:53.425
what to wear, how to act,
when to speak,

04:53.427 --> 04:55.293
and they're not even
married yet.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.962
Oh, I'm sorry, Mike.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.997
I can't be party to something
that I think is wrong.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.031
That's all.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.199
What are you saying?

05:01.201 --> 05:02.767
What I'm saying

05:02.769 --> 05:04.836
is maybe I'm not the best man
to be the best man,

05:04.838 --> 05:06.671
so I relieve myself
of the job.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.640
Okay.
Why don't you just quit?

05:08.642 --> 05:10.008
It's a good thing
we don't work together

05:10.010 --> 05:12.043
'cause that
would be awkward.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.050
Now, I'm going to need
all eyes on me,

05:19.052 --> 05:20.685
so make sure Boyd
doesn't take his sweet time

05:20.687 --> 05:21.987
bringing the rings
down the aisle.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.556
Uh, well,
we can't make any promises.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.857
(stammers) Mm.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.192
I'm sorry, what is --
(stammers)

05:27.194 --> 05:28.727
What is that?

05:28.729 --> 05:30.195
It's -- It's nothing, okay?

05:30.197 --> 05:32.297
Sometimes, Boyd gets
stage fright and freezes.

05:32.299 --> 05:33.999
Like last year's
Christmas pageant

05:34.001 --> 05:36.001
when only two wise men
made it to Jesus.

05:36.003 --> 05:39.638
Yeah. Our little magi
was stuck backstage

05:39.640 --> 05:41.973
with a handful
of myrrh.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.075
Uh, no.
You need to fix this.

05:44.077 --> 05:47.412
I don't have time to cast
another ring bearer, okay?

05:47.414 --> 05:51.149
Ryan, don't you have
some other children somewhere?

05:51.151 --> 05:52.851
Mandy, relax, okay?

05:52.853 --> 05:55.420
I promise that Boyd will make it
down the aisle with the rings.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.155
(sighs)
They say never work with kids,

05:57.157 --> 06:00.492
but he's family, so...

06:00.494 --> 06:02.060
Hey, what are we doing --
No. Mm!

06:02.062 --> 06:03.695
How many times
have I told you --

06:03.697 --> 06:05.597
the tea roses
go around the hydrangeas,

06:05.599 --> 06:08.033
and then you add
a splash of purple.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.535
That's not a splash.
That's a sploosh.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.505
Less sploosh,
more splash.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.040
Thank you.

06:15.042 --> 06:18.343
When do we get to throw rice
at her, and can it be rocks?

06:18.345 --> 06:21.880
Wow! This is how
I pictured my funeral.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.382
Except I want more flowers,
more crying,

06:24.384 --> 06:27.719
and John Elway up here going,
"He was such a stud."

06:27.721 --> 06:29.921
Honey, did you fix
the high-tops problem?

06:29.923 --> 06:31.856
Yes.

06:31.858 --> 06:33.925
Ed won't be wearing high tops
to the wedding.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.928
Oh, see, Mandy?
Dad fixed it.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.597
Because he's not coming
to the wedding.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.466
Ed isn't the best man
anymore?

06:41.468 --> 06:43.768
Mandy, honey, now, I'm sure
everything is gonna be fine.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.637
(chuckles)
Honey, what the hell happened?

06:45.639 --> 06:47.472
You know Ed.

06:47.474 --> 06:49.307
Talked about wearing
black shoes,

06:49.309 --> 06:52.544
we talked about Spider-Man,
and he quit.

06:52.546 --> 06:56.381
Queue Mandy's explosion
in 3, 2, 1...

06:56.383 --> 06:57.782
This is great.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.384
Well,
that was a let-down.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.653
Honestly, I never even
wanted Ed in the ceremony.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.054
MIKE: Oh.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.789
Because the pictures
were all gonna be, like,

07:04.791 --> 07:06.558
all these young people,
and then in the corner,

07:06.560 --> 07:08.893
like, Voldemort,
you know?

07:08.895 --> 07:10.261
You know,
I don't think

07:10.263 --> 07:11.563
Voldemort would come
to your wedding

07:11.565 --> 07:12.964
because he'd be
frightened of you.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.335
I'm going to get
something to drink.

07:17.337 --> 07:20.138
Hey, I got
the baby's breath.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.440
I would've been here
a lot sooner

07:22.442 --> 07:25.644
if someone had told me
it was a flower.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.013
Oh, uh, bad news.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.981
Um, Ed quit.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.750
What?

07:31.751 --> 07:33.518
Yeah, but good news.
You get to pick a new best man.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.587
No. Why would
Mr. Alzate quit?

07:35.589 --> 07:37.589
I don't know.
Weddings make some people crazy.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.124
(chuckles)

07:39.126 --> 07:41.192
(doorbell rings)

07:41.194 --> 07:42.527
-Hey.
-Hey, hi.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.295
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Okay, okay.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.498
So, the stationery
store said

07:46.500 --> 07:49.267
this is the only shade of blue
we haven't tried yet

07:49.269 --> 07:52.671
and that they never
want to see me again.

07:52.673 --> 07:53.938
Oh, thanks,
Mr. Larabee.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.774
Ooh, ooh, hey,
have you ever been

07:55.776 --> 07:57.375
the best man
at a wedding?

07:57.377 --> 07:59.678
(sighs)
Lots of times.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.513
Just not officially.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.848
Fabulous.

08:03.850 --> 08:06.184
Kyle here is shopping
for a new best man.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.319
Oh, okay.
(chuckles)

08:08.321 --> 08:11.690
Now, I'd love to be the only
raisin in your wedding oatmeal.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.693
I think I'll pass.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.860
(door closes)

08:15.862 --> 08:20.065
Mandy, I don't think anybody
can replace Mr. Alzate.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.566
What about you, Eve?

08:21.568 --> 08:23.034
You're kind of mannish,
and you don't have the shoulders

08:23.036 --> 08:25.403
to pull off
that bridesmaid dress.

08:25.405 --> 08:27.138
Well, then I won't be
in the wacky

08:27.140 --> 08:29.841
"bridesmaids getting ready"
photos.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.242
-Deal.
-Thank you.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.512
Hey, Dad.
Eve is the new best man.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.747
What -- What?

08:35.749 --> 08:38.316
What?
Are you okay with this?

08:38.318 --> 08:40.685
Whatever makes
Mandy happy.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.020
Aww, thanks, sweetie.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.222
Okay, let's go get her
to the tailor.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.826
Hopefully, he can make a tux
and do something with all this.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.360
Ouch. I'm going
to be thinking about that

08:49.362 --> 08:50.528
when I'm writing
my toast.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.597
You're gonna get burnt!

08:54.768 --> 08:58.369
I can't believe Ed quit.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.639
Yeah. And I can't believe
we haven't.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.512
So, for the reception later,
I'm practicing my

09:07.514 --> 09:08.680
"I don't want to come
to your table,

09:08.682 --> 09:10.048
but thank you
for the gift" wave.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.015
So, how does this look?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.855
A little gift
from the reverend.

09:16.857 --> 09:20.759
Between us,
I think he's had a few.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.762
Aww, Mom,
you're crying.

09:23.764 --> 09:27.298
I just thought this day
would never come.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.068
Come on.
It's gonna be great.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.369
You know
what they say --

09:31.371 --> 09:32.704
I'm not just
gaining a son,

09:32.706 --> 09:34.773
I'm spending
a fortune.

09:34.775 --> 09:39.377
Oh, Mom, Dad,
I want to thank you.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.412
I'm not sure what exactly
you've been doing,

09:41.414 --> 09:43.882
but it must be a lot
because you both look exhausted.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.417
Yo!

09:46.419 --> 09:48.920
Here on best-man biz.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.055
Get the camera ready
'cause this could be

09:51.057 --> 09:52.957
her last hissy fit
as a single gal.

09:52.959 --> 09:55.260
What -- What happened?
Is something wrong?

09:55.262 --> 09:56.461
Nothing happened.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.664
Kyle's wearing
the high tops.

10:00.967 --> 10:03.535
Well, look at that.
Something's happened.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.612
Kyle cannot wear
the high tops.

10:14.614 --> 10:18.016
Well, as best man,
I feel it is incumbent upon me

10:18.018 --> 10:22.320
to be the one
to get the hell out of here.

10:22.322 --> 10:26.324
Dad, you need
to fix this, now.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.693
A vein is about to pop
out of my forehead

10:28.695 --> 10:30.695
and ruin my pictures.

10:30.697 --> 10:32.864
Mandy, I love you...

10:32.866 --> 10:34.365
but I'm out.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.501
(chuckles)
What are you talking about?

10:36.503 --> 10:38.136
I know this wedding
scares you,

10:38.138 --> 10:40.705
and I fixed everything I can
to make it better for you,

10:40.707 --> 10:44.676
but you've crossed
from scared into scary.

10:44.678 --> 10:48.713
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Mom,
make Dad fix this.

10:48.715 --> 10:51.716
Uh, I --
I'm with your father.

10:51.718 --> 10:55.286
You have become a nightmare,
and we're out.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.489
Wow.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.457
Fine.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.025
I'm gonna go
handle things myself.

11:01.027 --> 11:02.493
Oh, and, by the way,
as far as being

11:02.495 --> 11:04.062
a wedding planner
is concerned,

11:04.064 --> 11:07.999
do not even think
about using me as a reference!

11:08.001 --> 11:11.135
(door closes)

11:11.137 --> 11:13.304
That felt great.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.942
(laughs)
So great.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.665
Kyle, open the door.

11:23.666 --> 11:25.516
KYLE: No. You can't see me
in my tux before the wedding.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.885
It's bad luck.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.821
N-No. No, honey,
that's just for the bride.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.190
Why would the bride
be in a tux?

11:32.192 --> 11:34.359
I think
this is a trick.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.660
Okay.

11:35.662 --> 11:38.062
Kyle, can you
just come out here, please?

11:39.766 --> 11:41.900
Hi.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.936
I really don't want you
to wear the high tops.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.771
No, I have to.

11:46.773 --> 11:48.072
Why?

11:48.074 --> 11:50.909
Have I ever told you about my
job interview with Mr. Alzate?

11:50.911 --> 11:52.043
I'm sure
it's a super-great story,

11:52.045 --> 11:53.378
but we really
don't have time right now.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.246
I had to borrow a suit
from a friend,

11:55.248 --> 11:56.848
but I forgot to ask
for shoes.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.549
And so, I wound up wearing
the only ones I had --

11:58.551 --> 11:59.717
high tops.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.419
I was wrong.
It's not a great story.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.389
When Mr. Alzate saw me
in those shoes, he said,

12:04.391 --> 12:05.957
"You're an original, kid.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.425
I want you on my team."

12:09.095 --> 12:11.062
Look,
because of those shoes,

12:11.064 --> 12:13.197
he gave me the job
at Outdoor Man.

12:13.199 --> 12:15.300
And because of that,
I met Mr. B.,

12:15.302 --> 12:19.370
and because of Mr. B.,
I met the love of my life.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.707
How come you never
told me that before?

12:22.709 --> 12:25.710
Well, you've been
kind of...

12:25.712 --> 12:26.778
(sighs)

12:26.780 --> 12:29.247
A nightmare?

12:29.249 --> 12:32.650
Well, I was gonna say
distracted,

12:32.652 --> 12:34.485
but yeah, kind of.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.887
Oh.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.655
Mr. Alzate
is like a dad to me.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.724
And if he can't be there
in person,

12:39.726 --> 12:44.162
then at least
he'll be there in sneaker.

12:45.732 --> 12:46.564
Mm.

12:46.566 --> 12:47.565
Ah.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.434
You know the worst thing
about horror movies?

12:49.436 --> 12:52.403
The monster
always comes back.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.573
I've wrecked my wedding.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.910
Oh, God, she killed Kyle.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.411
(chuckles)

13:00.413 --> 13:02.313
You didn't, did you?

13:02.315 --> 13:05.416
I was so worried
about making everything perfect

13:05.418 --> 13:06.784
for the wedding,

13:06.786 --> 13:08.920
I didn't realize
I was ruining it for Kyle.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.456
Oh, honey,
if it makes you feel any better,

13:11.458 --> 13:13.291
you didn't just ruin it
for Kyle.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.159
Vanessa.

13:15.161 --> 13:18.696
You know what?
You haven't wrecked anything.

13:18.698 --> 13:22.133
You tend to get scared
when things change,

13:22.135 --> 13:24.669
and you overwork
the details.

13:24.671 --> 13:27.872
You forget that there
are other people around.

13:27.874 --> 13:31.109
Maybe that's something
you should remember now.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.444
Honey, all this,
it's wonderful,

13:33.446 --> 13:35.613
but this isn't
what it's about.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.882
All a wedding needs
is two people

13:37.884 --> 13:41.052
who love each other
and the people who love them.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.454
And for Kyle,
that means having Ed there.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.790
Okay. I think I know
how to fix this,

13:45.792 --> 13:48.493
but I'm going to need
your help pulling it off.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.763
Now, this is the girl
I love to help.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.005
Mandy.
Wait a minute.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.673
Isn't there someplace
you need to be right now?

14:02.675 --> 14:03.674
(chuckles)

14:03.676 --> 14:05.410
Yeah.
Right here.

14:05.412 --> 14:08.913
Ed, I want you to reconsider
being best man.

14:08.915 --> 14:10.314
No, I can't.

14:10.316 --> 14:13.584
I already went over this
with your father.

14:13.586 --> 14:17.755
Now, the road you and Kyle
are going down is, well...

14:17.757 --> 14:18.756
troubling.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.425
I understand.
I know.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.660
I made my wedding
all about me.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.028
<i> The</i> wedding.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.998
Right.
And I get that now.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.200
Although, in my defense,

14:29.202 --> 14:31.402
there is no magazine
called "Modern Groom."

14:33.706 --> 14:36.040
Well, at least
you're willing to admit it.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.176
(chuckles)
It took me four marriages

14:38.178 --> 14:42.280
and a 10-hour deposition
to get there, so...

14:42.282 --> 14:43.881
I'm not perfect.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.285
But being with Kyle makes me
want to be a better person.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.454
You know, he always says
he doesn't deserve me,

14:49.456 --> 14:51.289
but I know
it's the other way around.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.690
Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah.

14:52.692 --> 14:55.560
That sweet little moppet
has burrowed his way

14:55.562 --> 14:56.561
into my ticker, as well.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.795
(laughs)

14:57.797 --> 15:00.798
Guess you and I
are a lot alike.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.966
Hm?

15:01.968 --> 15:04.102
Except that
I have youth...

15:04.104 --> 15:06.104
and hair.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.239
Listen, I have money...

15:08.241 --> 15:11.809

15:11.811 --> 15:16.881
Listen, I love Kyle,
and he really, really

15:16.883 --> 15:20.885
wants you at my --
<i> our</i> wedding.

15:20.887 --> 15:23.454
All right.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.656
That's how you really feel,
I'm back in.

We'd better get
to that church.

a little uptight.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.163
I know, right?

15:32.165 --> 15:34.565
It's like, "Calm down.
It's just a wedding."

15:34.567 --> 15:36.300
-But, no, no.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.388
I do.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.091
That's
the "I do" I do.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.998
And, Mandy,
do you take Kyle

20:01.000 --> 20:03.868
to be your
lawfully wedded husband?

20:03.870 --> 20:05.569
I totally do.

20:05.571 --> 20:07.538
Then, by the powers
vested in me

20:07.540 --> 20:10.040
by the church,
the state of Colorado,

20:10.042 --> 20:12.676
and this fine
sporting-goods establishment,

20:12.678 --> 20:15.012
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

20:17.116 --> 20:19.316
(cheers and applause)

20:22.522 --> 20:25.656
♪♪

20:28.394 --> 20:30.761
Come on, you guys.
Pull it together.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.196
(sniffles) Wow.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.365
There's some dust
in here or something.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.811
We may have stumbled upon
a new revenue source here.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.212
Yeah, yeah.

20:48.214 --> 20:50.614
We could have actual
shotgun weddings.

20:50.616 --> 20:52.450
(clicks tongue)

20:52.452 --> 20:54.285
Mikey, did I see
you get a little misty-eyed

20:54.287 --> 20:55.386
during the ceremony?

20:55.388 --> 20:56.754
Yeah.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.722
Although, I don't know if it
was my daughter getting married

20:58.724 --> 21:00.891
or the fact that I paid
for a church we didn't use.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.827
-Yeah.
-(Sighs)

21:02.829 --> 21:04.295
Reverend.
Now, come on, be honest.

21:04.297 --> 21:05.896
-That wasn't that bad, right?
-Thank you.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.832
You know what?
She's a beautiful bride,

21:07.834 --> 21:09.567
and in the end,
it turned out wonderful.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.435
Terrific.
Wonderful, isn't it?

21:11.437 --> 21:13.103
And, uh, Reverend,
Reverend, hey,

21:13.105 --> 21:15.506
I said, "Something
off the shelf."

21:15.508 --> 21:17.107
Yep.
This is on him.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.276
Oh, I'll be back
to get the others later.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.478
-Thanks, Mike.
-Uh-huh.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.480
(stammers)
The others?

21:22.482 --> 21:25.483
How much is this wedding
going to cost me?

21:25.485 --> 21:29.186
A lot less
than your first four.

21:29.188 --> 21:32.256
