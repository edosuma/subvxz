00:31.100 --> 00:34.068
[eerie orchestral music]
[crickets chirping]

00:34.103 --> 00:37.106
[grass crunching]

00:37.968 --> 00:39.246
[urine trickling]

00:39.280 --> 00:40.764
- [Duke] [grunts] Doris likes
mine just the way it is.

00:40.799 --> 00:43.112
- [Danny] I told you to stop
talkin' to me 'bout that.

00:43.146 --> 00:44.113
- [Duke] Why the hell you do

00:44.147 --> 00:45.769
somethin' like that to your kid?

00:45.804 --> 00:48.082
- I was that way,
my daddy's that way.

00:48.117 --> 00:50.084
My daddy's daddy's that way.

00:50.119 --> 00:52.638
[spits] And it's sanitary.

00:53.812 --> 00:55.779
- It's a goddamn myth.
[owl hooting]

00:55.814 --> 00:57.091
- It looks good too.

00:57.126 --> 00:58.817
Just ask Charlene.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.819
- Charlene don't know shit.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.993
Circumcision cuts off
1,000 nerve endings

01:03.028 --> 01:04.477
and some kinda
natural lubricant.

01:04.512 --> 01:07.136
Now that'll make fuckin'
Charlene actually tolerable.

01:08.482 --> 01:10.000
- Why does everybody do it then?

01:11.140 --> 01:13.280
- Well some guy who
invented Corn flakes.

01:13.314 --> 01:14.798
Probably to keep kids
from masturbatin'.

01:14.833 --> 01:19.803
C'mon.
[Duke spitting]

01:19.838 --> 01:22.116
[leaves rustling]

01:22.151 --> 01:23.635
- That him?

01:23.669 --> 01:27.673
- Yeah, the blood trail
leads that way, let's go.

01:34.508 --> 01:36.648
[wolf howling]
[crickets chirping]

01:36.682 --> 01:40.030
[soft orchestral music]

01:44.345 --> 01:45.691
Whoa, what the?

01:46.865 --> 01:49.695
- [Danny] You think
a deer did this?

01:49.730 --> 01:53.147
- [Duke] Deer? [chuckles softly]

01:53.182 --> 01:54.355
What the hell?

01:55.529 --> 01:56.875
- I do not know.

02:02.881 --> 02:05.021
Whoa.
[lights whirring]

02:05.055 --> 02:06.091
What is that?

02:08.231 --> 02:09.508
[twig snapping]

02:09.543 --> 02:10.854
Did you hear that?
- What?

02:10.889 --> 02:12.201
- By the trees.
- Nope.

02:16.412 --> 02:19.380
- Oh jeez, there's
more than one.

02:19.415 --> 02:21.071
So we grab that thing and split.

02:22.728 --> 02:23.867
Could be worth money.

02:23.902 --> 02:26.525
[alien growling]

02:26.560 --> 02:30.529
[intense foreboding music]
[Danny wincing]

02:30.564 --> 02:31.254
- Oh shit.

02:33.083 --> 02:37.709
[twig snapping]
[alien growling]

02:37.743 --> 02:40.367
This isn't how the
gypsy said I'd go.

02:40.401 --> 02:41.540
[gun blasting]

02:41.575 --> 02:45.234
[galactic orchestral music]

03:35.284 --> 03:38.632
[soft orchestral music]

04:27.888 --> 04:29.648
- The universe is endless.

04:29.683 --> 04:31.029
[eerie foreboding music]

04:31.063 --> 04:33.342
Cold and impartial.

04:35.344 --> 04:38.519
We exist because we
fought to be here.

04:41.039 --> 04:42.696
The universe gave us a chance.

04:43.869 --> 04:48.874
We grabbed hold, planted
our flag in the ground

04:49.565 --> 04:50.255
and said, "We belong."

04:52.222 --> 04:54.880
Survival is fought for.

04:57.918 --> 05:00.058
Right now ladies and gentlemen,

05:01.231 --> 05:05.097
we are on a decaying
planet of our own doing.

05:06.375 --> 05:07.721
Well one day, Earth

05:10.068 --> 05:10.896
will die

05:12.070 --> 05:17.075
and we as a species will
need to find [gasps]

05:17.731 --> 05:18.594
a new home.

05:20.734 --> 05:24.047
Now greedy corporations and
their puppets in Congress

05:24.082 --> 05:25.877
are only speeding things up,

05:25.911 --> 05:28.258
so that's why we must act now!

05:30.916 --> 05:32.884
Invest in a Stars
with Skaggs project

05:32.918 --> 05:35.058
for intergalactic travel.

05:35.093 --> 05:38.234
Together, we can discover
unknown pockets of the universe

05:38.268 --> 05:42.721
and need mankind to a new
[inhales] pine-fresh home.

05:42.756 --> 05:46.311
Your money will make
for a better universe!

05:50.764 --> 05:51.592
Hi, Kenneth.

05:52.938 --> 05:53.767
- Hi.
[curtains whooshing]

05:53.801 --> 05:55.389
What the hell are you doing?

05:55.424 --> 05:59.393
- I was just rehearsing
for a future presentation

05:59.428 --> 06:02.638
for my space travel
company Stars with Skaggs.

06:03.811 --> 06:05.951
- That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

06:07.470 --> 06:09.576
Have you tested the equipment?

06:09.610 --> 06:11.578
- I started to.

06:11.612 --> 06:13.580
- I have a lecture in 30 minutes

06:13.614 --> 06:17.480
and the sound must be
an echo to the senses.

06:19.309 --> 06:20.138
- Right.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.796
- And have you
replaced the bulbs?

06:24.314 --> 06:26.282
- You didn't say anything
about replacing the bulbs.

06:26.316 --> 06:28.111
- I sent you an email last night

06:28.146 --> 06:29.596
and I know you were
on your computer

06:29.630 --> 06:31.356
because of your
masturbation problem.

06:32.633 --> 06:34.152
- I wouldn't call it problem.

06:34.980 --> 06:36.326
- Then where are my bulbs?

06:37.466 --> 06:39.813
- Yeah okay, I'll
get right on it.

06:41.815 --> 06:44.473
- And the log report: stay
late and finish it, okay?

06:46.164 --> 06:48.304
- Actually Kenneth, I can't.

06:48.338 --> 06:49.443
It's my birthday today

06:49.478 --> 06:51.618
and my friends and
I are goin' on--

06:51.652 --> 06:54.828
- I don't care about
your birthday, okay?!

06:54.862 --> 06:57.451
You're my assistant and
you're supposed to assist me.

06:57.486 --> 06:58.970
So do you wanna keep your job

06:59.004 --> 07:02.007
or do you wanna drink Mai
Tais with your friends?

07:02.042 --> 07:05.390
[soft orchestral music]

07:07.012 --> 07:08.358
- Mai Tais.
- Huh?

07:10.188 --> 07:12.880
- Oh I'm sorry, was that
not an echo to the senses?

07:14.882 --> 07:15.849
Mai Tais.

07:18.196 --> 07:19.680
Have a good lecture, Kenneth.

07:22.372 --> 07:23.373
- Hey, wait!

07:23.408 --> 07:25.168
Come here.
- Whoa, ow.

07:25.203 --> 07:26.998
God, unhand me.

07:27.032 --> 07:28.378
- Give that to me, you.

07:30.035 --> 07:33.038
You will never work in
a planetarium again!

07:38.527 --> 07:40.494
- Jesus, interesting.
- Hey, hey.

07:40.529 --> 07:41.391
The coat.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.050
- Coat?

07:45.085 --> 07:47.018
Here's your coat.

07:47.052 --> 07:47.881
Huh, huh?

07:49.054 --> 07:50.400
- Hey, pick it up.

07:53.403 --> 07:54.543
C'mon.
- Yeah, okay.

07:56.234 --> 07:57.718
But I'm leavin' it there.

07:57.753 --> 07:58.857
- [Kenneth] Thank you!

07:58.892 --> 08:02.516
[soft whimsical music]

08:02.551 --> 08:03.862
- Oh shit.

08:03.897 --> 08:05.933
Hi. Oh oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh jeez.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.212
Pardon me. Sorry, Tracy.
- Watch it, man.

08:09.247 --> 08:10.213
- Got a lotta momentum.

08:10.248 --> 08:11.042
I'll see ya.
- Bye, Brian.

08:11.076 --> 08:12.699
- Never.

08:12.733 --> 08:13.734
Oh my god.

08:19.464 --> 08:20.292
What the?

08:21.742 --> 08:22.916
You gotta be fuckin'.

08:22.950 --> 08:24.538
Fuck my life.

08:24.573 --> 08:26.298
You fucking fuckface.

08:29.923 --> 08:30.613
Not you.

08:32.097 --> 08:35.100
[cellphone buzzing]

08:36.274 --> 08:41.279
[text message blooping]
[poignant piano music]

09:04.302 --> 09:06.269
[all chuckling and chattering]

09:06.304 --> 09:08.582
- I don't need to
stand anymore, right?

09:08.617 --> 09:10.584
- Cheese.
- No, you're good.

09:10.619 --> 09:12.759
[chuckles] We were not
in-sync on that one.

09:12.793 --> 09:15.934
- No.
- No.

09:15.969 --> 09:18.488
- Ooh, but it's adorable.
- Ooh.

09:21.319 --> 09:23.493
- Hey, all right.

09:24.494 --> 09:25.599
- Thanks.

09:25.634 --> 09:27.118
- Alex.
- Stop!

09:27.152 --> 09:28.947
- Thank you.
- Just a little.

09:28.982 --> 09:30.121
[Jess chuckling]

09:30.155 --> 09:33.296
- To Brian's birthday!
- Here, here.

09:33.331 --> 09:36.610
- And to the last Leonid
meteor shower together.

09:36.645 --> 09:37.784
- What, the last?

09:37.818 --> 09:39.820
- Yeah, the last
year of college.

09:39.855 --> 09:41.788
We might not have time
to make a yearly trip

09:41.822 --> 09:43.513
once our careers take off.

09:44.653 --> 09:46.137
- We could always find time.

09:46.171 --> 09:47.794
- I don't know, man.

09:47.828 --> 09:50.486
You'll be busy blowin'
shit up at NASA.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.799
I'll be savin' lives in the OR.

09:52.833 --> 09:56.526
Jess fighting
deforestation in Guatemala.

09:56.561 --> 09:57.527
[chuckles] Alex?

09:58.528 --> 10:00.151
Well Alex might be free.
- Yeah.

10:00.185 --> 10:01.670
[Louis laughing]

10:01.704 --> 10:02.981
- Hey, Louis.

10:03.016 --> 10:05.156
You know, I'm really
disappointed in you.

10:05.190 --> 10:07.158
This is our thing, man.

10:07.192 --> 10:10.195
This has been our thing since
we were in elementary school.

10:12.542 --> 10:13.992
The real world can't
take that away.

10:14.027 --> 10:17.168
- [scoffs] My dad
says the real world

10:17.202 --> 10:19.826
is an unforgiving
thief of happiness.

10:19.860 --> 10:22.863
And knowing my
dad, I believe it.

10:22.898 --> 10:26.004
- Well, I hereby
declare this not be

10:26.039 --> 10:28.006
the last Leonid meteor shower,

10:28.041 --> 10:30.043
but a yearly continuation
until the day we die.

10:30.077 --> 10:31.700
- And I concur.

10:31.734 --> 10:33.356
- Yay. [chuckles]

10:33.391 --> 10:34.185
- Duke it.

10:34.219 --> 10:35.358
Yup, yup.

10:35.393 --> 10:36.877
What, what yeah!
- Oh.

10:38.396 --> 10:42.055
- Lest we forget.
- To our yearly meteor break!

10:42.089 --> 10:43.366
I would live to come, you guys.

10:43.401 --> 10:45.541
Oh Frederick, how
are you darling?

10:45.575 --> 10:48.026
But if I don't take care of
my plants, who's going to?

10:48.061 --> 10:49.027
This year is bad.

10:49.062 --> 10:50.857
We can't have little Olaf

10:50.891 --> 10:52.721
freezing his little
butt off, can we?

10:54.723 --> 10:56.034
- Hey man, yeah.

10:56.069 --> 11:00.901
Things have been a
little, you know. [gasps]

11:01.591 --> 11:03.593
[shrieks] Yes!

11:06.596 --> 11:08.046
[Louis shrieking]

11:08.081 --> 11:09.910
Yeah, this year is bad.

11:09.945 --> 11:12.085
- Yo Brian, d'you see this shit?

11:12.119 --> 11:14.570
[chuckles] 20, motherfucker.

11:14.604 --> 11:15.882
- 21.
- No no no no.

11:15.916 --> 11:17.228
Fuck, man.

11:17.262 --> 11:18.401
You fuckin'. No no, you
ain't takin' that shit.

11:18.436 --> 11:19.230
Dude, this year's bad.

11:19.264 --> 11:20.403
No, no.

11:20.438 --> 11:21.439
[shouts] No!

11:21.473 --> 11:22.440
- Faster, people.

11:22.474 --> 11:23.717
We're on a deadline.

11:23.752 --> 11:24.718
Can you bring that
tree over here?

11:24.753 --> 11:26.237
What are you doing?

11:26.271 --> 11:28.101
I told you 15 minutes ago,
that's not how you do that.

11:28.135 --> 11:29.240
You guys, we're
opening the garden.

11:29.274 --> 11:30.448
This year is bad.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.243
C'mon, bring the plant.

11:32.277 --> 11:33.589
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

11:33.623 --> 11:34.728
[glove snapping]
Ow.

11:34.763 --> 11:36.247
All right,

11:36.281 --> 11:37.248
so we're just gonna have
to make a small incision.

11:37.282 --> 11:38.421
It's gonna be about two inches.

11:38.456 --> 11:39.733
- Incision?
- Shh shh shh.

11:39.768 --> 11:41.597
It's better if you
don't speak, 'kay?

11:41.631 --> 11:42.460
This year's bad.

11:44.117 --> 11:47.258
- [breathes heavily] Oh shit.

11:47.292 --> 11:50.606
How's my ass look from
back there, guys? [laughs]

11:50.640 --> 11:51.434
This year's bad, man.

11:51.469 --> 11:52.263
This year's bad.

11:52.297 --> 11:53.609
Oh, fuck!
[siren wailing]

11:53.643 --> 11:55.438
- Oh, do you feel cool
with your chainsaws?

11:55.473 --> 11:56.646
I wish I could be there,

11:56.681 --> 11:57.786
but I'm in the middle
of saving the forest.

11:57.820 --> 11:59.166
This year's bad.

12:00.961 --> 12:02.618
[chainsaw buzzing]

12:02.652 --> 12:04.758
- [Maggie] My mother
was right about you!

12:04.793 --> 12:06.760
[muffled shrieking]

12:06.795 --> 12:08.313
- [sighs] This year's bad.

12:09.798 --> 12:12.835
- Dude, last night
was fuckin' epic.

12:14.319 --> 12:15.493
This year's bad [vomits].

12:22.811 --> 12:24.329
- This year's good.

12:25.158 --> 12:27.850
[birds chirping]

12:44.349 --> 12:47.007
[Brian humming]

12:49.354 --> 12:52.702
[soft orchestral music]

13:16.726 --> 13:18.038
"Happy birthday, son.

13:18.073 --> 13:20.040
"Your mother and I
could not be more proud.

"30 years old with your
eyes still on the prize.

"Don't let it bother
you that Elon Musk

Aww, dad.

Never got an A
either. [chuckles]

25:10.301 --> 25:12.234
Really haven't got with it.

25:12.269 --> 25:13.546
- In my school, we just
did for participation.

25:13.581 --> 25:14.409
We had no grades.

25:14.443 --> 25:16.066

25:16.100 --> 25:20.311
Never have I ever used
grape jelly as a lubricant.

25:22.486 --> 25:24.281
- And it worked "grape"

25:25.938 --> 25:28.250

wrong with my phone.

26:09.637 --> 26:11.500

- Here.

26:16.644 --> 26:18.300
I don't know.

26:18.335 --> 26:20.613
It could be an energy not
confined to a local force,

26:20.648 --> 26:22.995
so it's something non-linear

26:23.029 --> 26:26.481
that would allow
aperiodic behaviors.

with the lights back on.

43:51.214 --> 43:53.216
- No but I'm standing.

43:54.701 --> 43:56.012
- We're gonna get to
the hospital, okay?

43:56.047 --> 43:57.669
So stay alive.

43:57.704 --> 43:58.843
- Okay.

43:58.877 --> 43:59.706
Jess,

44:01.569 --> 44:02.674
I'm sorry.

44:02.709 --> 44:03.848
- I'll tell you what
a jackass you are

44:03.882 --> 44:06.022
when you're on the mend, okay?

44:06.057 --> 44:06.885
- The Schwinns!

44:09.577 --> 44:11.027
- Our old bikes?

44:11.062 --> 44:12.235
- Yeah, they should still
be somewhere in the barn.

44:12.270 --> 44:13.374
- Thought you said there
were monsters out there.

44:13.409 --> 44:15.238

44:25.939 --> 44:27.699
This is madness.

44:27.734 --> 44:30.702
- Don't worry, I think I left
a six-pack in here somewhere.

44:30.737 --> 44:32.739
- Okay, there you guys go.

44:32.773 --> 44:33.878
The bikes.

44:33.912 --> 44:36.052
I think if we split up.
- Found 'em!

[Brian coughing]
[tarp whooshing]

44:41.264 --> 44:44.405
- Wow, these bikes
do not look healthy.

44:44.440 --> 44:45.717
- Jess is right.

44:45.752 --> 44:47.063
These things could
fall apart on us.

44:47.098 --> 44:49.410
- Hey guys, can you
come here and tell me

44:49.445 --> 44:51.412
if I'm actually seein' a thing

44:51.447 --> 44:54.622
or if this thing's a
manifestation of the shrooms?

44:57.660 --> 44:59.317
- Whoa, what is that?

45:01.112 --> 45:03.286
- It looks otherworldly.

45:04.460 --> 45:06.496
- [Brian] Well careful,
it might be dangerous.

45:10.949 --> 45:13.434
- [Louis] Bri, when did
your dad get into welding?

45:13.469 --> 45:16.265
- [huffs] You're the
Bill Nye of the group.

45:16.299 --> 45:17.128
What is it?

45:19.682 --> 45:20.510
- I don't know.

45:21.960 --> 45:23.272
I've seen enough movies to say

45:23.306 --> 45:24.825
with grave certainty
it's nothin' good.

45:27.172 --> 45:28.622
- [Alex] Looks like
a giant football.

45:28.656 --> 45:30.797
- What happens when
this thing's all lit up?

45:32.315 --> 45:34.490
- [Louis] Jesus
Christ, don't touch it!

45:34.524 --> 45:36.630
- What is this?

45:36.664 --> 45:38.114
A bomb?

[Zachary wincing]

45:40.185 --> 45:41.152
- Zach, no!

45:45.363 --> 45:46.778
- It ain't no Babadook.

45:46.813 --> 45:48.815
- Oh my god, it's an alien.

[alien growling]

you doing? Hurry up!

46:12.183 --> 46:15.842
[galactic orchestral music]

46:21.537 --> 46:23.539
- [Alex] Holy, I
wanna get an alien!

46:23.573 --> 46:26.162
- [Brian] I can't believe
we just saw an alien.

46:26.197 --> 46:28.337
- I'm glad you're excited, Bri.

46:28.371 --> 46:30.511
I'm so fucking happy
you have enough material

46:30.546 --> 46:33.549
for your next science project,
but my boyfriend is dead.

46:34.584 --> 46:35.862
And he may not have
been the best boyfriend,

46:35.896 --> 46:38.381
but he was a human
being who I care about.

46:39.382 --> 46:40.211
- Sorry, Jess.

46:41.384 --> 46:42.351
I get carried away.

46:42.385 --> 46:43.835
- You always get carried away.

46:43.870 --> 46:46.596
Whether it's your fantasies
about building rockets

46:47.563 --> 46:49.013
or taking too many gin shots.

46:49.047 --> 46:51.705
[Alex chuckling]

46:51.739 --> 46:52.844
Why don't you apply
some of that energy

46:52.879 --> 46:55.226
to something with an
actual end result?

46:55.260 --> 46:58.850

condolences and all.

46:58.885 --> 47:00.541
But can we please save
the personal grievance

47:00.576 --> 47:02.716
for after we escape the alien?

47:02.750 --> 47:04.269
Come on guys, let's pedal.

47:06.409 --> 47:07.238
- Wait!

47:08.273 --> 47:09.550
What if Zach was right?

47:09.585 --> 47:11.725
What if that is a
bomb back there?

47:11.759 --> 47:14.417
- So, about that pedaling.

47:14.452 --> 47:15.280
Yeah.

47:22.909 --> 47:24.082
Oh, fuck me sideways.

Dude, a bomb!

47:28.431 --> 47:31.779
[soft orchestral music]

47:33.609 --> 47:35.128
- According to Stephen Hawking:

47:36.612 --> 47:39.926
If intelligent alien life
exists which apparently it does,

47:42.929 --> 47:46.242
they'll most likely conquer
earth to exploit our resources.

47:46.277 --> 47:47.450
- That sounds terrifying.

47:47.485 --> 47:48.900
So why are we stopped?!

47:48.935 --> 47:53.077
- That device had
a light meter on it

47:53.111 --> 47:54.423
that was nearly powered up.

47:54.457 --> 47:56.908
- But what happens when
all the lights are lit?

47:56.943 --> 47:58.772
- It does whatever it
was designed to do,

47:58.806 --> 48:03.811
whether that be a bomb or
some kinda matter decimator.

48:05.123 --> 48:07.263
- Isn't the latter just a
fancier way of sayin' bomb?

48:07.298 --> 48:11.474
- The point is:
Earth is in trouble.

48:12.959 --> 48:14.788
- You want us to go back?

48:14.822 --> 48:16.307
Are you insane?

48:16.341 --> 48:19.448
I don't know about you, but
I don't wanna die tonight.

48:19.482 --> 48:21.450
Again, my condolences.

48:21.484 --> 48:23.107
- [Brian] Someone
has to stop it.

48:23.141 --> 48:25.143
- [Louis] That's what
the police are for, man.

48:25.178 --> 48:26.627

not gonna be time.

48:45.853 --> 48:48.511

to be here.

48:57.175 --> 48:59.488
[inspirational music]

48:59.522 --> 49:02.215
The universe gave us a chance

49:04.010 --> 49:05.011
and we grabbed hold.

49:06.529 --> 49:09.222
We planted our flag in the
ground and said, "We belong."

49:19.025 --> 49:21.717

to anyone or anything.

make any sense.

01:09:15.392 --> 01:09:17.049
Big Oil would want
this thing activated

01:09:17.082 --> 01:09:19.395
so they could keep
goin' business as usual.
