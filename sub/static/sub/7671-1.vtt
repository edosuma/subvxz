01:49.568 --> 01:51.819
A soldier does not speak...

01:51.987 --> 01:55.239
...until spoken to
by a superior officer.

01:56.575 --> 01:59.535
A soldier shows no mercy.

02:00.412 --> 02:01.746
Mercy is weakness.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.416
Weakness is death.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.346
The Forces are his family.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.181
He is most happy...

02:20.724 --> 02:22.934
...when following orders.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.686
A soldier lives to kill.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.740
A soldier needs no friend or family.

02:38.575 --> 02:42.495
War is his friend. The
Forces are his family.

07:07.135 --> 07:10.137
Sir, Colonel Mekum has
his new batch unpacked.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.598
I think he wants to show them off.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.365
Well...

07:31.701 --> 07:34.036
- They're pretty.
- What's so hot about them?

07:34.246 --> 07:36.664
They're very much improved, captain.

07:37.124 --> 07:40.042
Colonel Mekum from HQ. He's
their commanding officer.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.710
Sir.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.882
"Improved." How?

07:47.050 --> 07:48.676
In every way possible.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.846
You see, your old ones,
they're selected at birth.

07:52.013 --> 07:55.307
With my new ones, we're
talking recombination.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.061
They're practically manufactured,
using DNA profiles...

07:59.229 --> 08:02.148
...and some manipulation.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.400
More endurance, quicker responses...

08:04.568 --> 08:05.818
...better hand-eye...

08:05.986 --> 08:07.903
...improved technical training.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.572
It's a whole different standard.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.742
My daddy was in maintenance...

08:13.910 --> 08:15.744
...and he had a saying. He used to say:

08:15.912 --> 08:17.913
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."

08:19.082 --> 08:21.083
Maintenance.

08:22.586 --> 08:25.296
I'm afraid I don't get your point.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.714
The veterans you see...

08:26.882 --> 08:30.384
...standing before you here have
been through all kinds of heavy shit.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.595
They've always got the job done.

08:32.761 --> 08:36.307
Your new soldiers, these hotshots,
how much action have they seen?

08:36.474 --> 08:38.851
And are they battle-tested?

08:40.729 --> 08:44.063
How about a few tests,
just to get you on board?

08:44.232 --> 08:46.817
Make you a believer.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.753
Ninety-nine percent. That's...

09:05.921 --> 09:07.004
...very good.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.138
Seen enough, captain?

09:17.098 --> 09:19.183
What about endurance?

09:53.176 --> 09:55.386
Caine 607, forward.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.887
Sir!

09:57.722 --> 10:00.015
Fifteen miles, 607, on the run.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.684
You've got 60 minutes.

10:01.851 --> 10:02.893
Go.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.154
My man left exactly...

10:14.322 --> 10:16.031
...20 minutes after yours.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.700
Make a note of that.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.339
Age is a factor. But the real
factor is the training program.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.466
Especially the psychological.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.802
The mind controls the body, after all.

11:18.970 --> 11:22.639
And we're doing such
wonderful things with the mind.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.899
Sir!

11:32.942 --> 11:34.693
At ease, soldier.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.030
What is the price of all that speed?

11:38.198 --> 11:39.782
Is your soldier tired?

11:40.950 --> 11:42.493
Tired?

11:42.660 --> 11:44.787
Todd ran the pace he's
been taught to run...

11:44.954 --> 11:47.206
...and he's still strong.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.543
Send him up the chain, Rube.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.004
Soldier! Up the chain!

11:54.172 --> 11:56.256
Sir!

12:04.307 --> 12:05.974
607, on the double, up the chain.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.142
Sir!

12:34.754 --> 12:36.880
What about spirit?

12:37.048 --> 12:39.466
I believe you mean AQ,
captain. Aggressive qualities.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.344
Much higher. Much better.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.805
What if they fought?

12:44.973 --> 12:47.349
You mean up there?

12:47.517 --> 12:49.268
Go ahead, Rube.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.186
Tell Todd to take him.

12:51.354 --> 12:52.938
No.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.316
No?

12:57.861 --> 12:59.236
Not fair.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.654
No contest.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.865
Send two more of your old ones up.

13:06.369 --> 13:10.122
Romero, Goines, up the chain!

13:36.983 --> 13:38.609
Get him, men!

15:26.718 --> 15:29.011
Get down here.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.680
Get down here!

15:31.848 --> 15:34.349
Get your ass down here on the double!

15:34.517 --> 15:36.935
Come on, double up! Down, down!

15:38.896 --> 15:40.647
Sir!

15:41.858 --> 15:43.692
Look at you.

15:44.485 --> 15:49.197
Do you know how much it cost
to breed you, you big moron?

15:49.365 --> 15:51.116
To train you?

15:51.284 --> 15:53.201
To feed you?

15:58.207 --> 16:00.292
What good is this man now?

16:01.669 --> 16:03.420
He's got no depth perception!

16:05.048 --> 16:10.010
All he can do is walk,
point, and take the first hit.

16:14.515 --> 16:17.225
- What about the bodies?
- Waste disposal.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.066
Fall in.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.567
Sir!

16:33.409 --> 16:35.786
Todd was our best man.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.041
You still don't get it, do you, captain?

16:45.546 --> 16:47.339
Your men...

16:47.507 --> 16:49.257
...are obsolete.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.184
You'll write this up as
a training accident...

16:59.352 --> 17:02.646
...and you'll make sure these bodies
get dumped a long way from here.

17:02.814 --> 17:06.733
We don't want any unnecessary questions.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.455
Someone, please...

22:53.622 --> 22:55.832
...let the rest of us
know what's going on!

22:56.000 --> 22:58.960
Hawkins! Give us something! Anything!

22:59.128 --> 23:01.171
Quiet, please!

23:01.338 --> 23:03.423
Quiet!

23:03.632 --> 23:05.216
How many of them are there?

23:05.426 --> 23:06.926
There is one man...

23:07.136 --> 23:08.428
...unarmed.

23:08.596 --> 23:12.474
How could there only be
one? How could he get here?

23:12.641 --> 23:14.684
He was unconscious when we found him.

23:15.936 --> 23:18.271
We couldn't ask him anything.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.648
Hang on. Jimmy's back!

23:20.816 --> 23:22.776
There's nothing out there.

23:22.943 --> 23:24.527
I couldn't see nobody.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.696
Couldn't see no vehicles,
no ship, nothing.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.366
Plus the wind's up again real strong.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.328
Everybody, calm down.

23:35.331 --> 23:37.957
We have an injured man among us.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.335
We all want to do the decent thing.

23:40.503 --> 23:43.213
The decent thing is to help him.

23:43.380 --> 23:46.382
Sandra, Mace's wife, is
looking after him now.

23:47.510 --> 23:51.012
Now, I'd like a vote of
support from all of you.

23:54.016 --> 23:55.725
You keep an eye on him, Mace.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.186
Watch him.

24:58.539 --> 25:01.416
There are words on his shoulder.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.585
Tannhauser Gate...

25:03.752 --> 25:06.045
...Argentine Sector...

25:06.213 --> 25:08.298
...Shanghai 2012.

25:10.968 --> 25:13.553
Sandra, the Tannhauser
Gate was a battle.

25:13.721 --> 25:16.264
He's a soldier.

25:33.115 --> 25:34.949
Where's Nathan?

25:35.868 --> 25:38.620
Nathan. Nathan!

25:51.508 --> 25:52.675
It's a tiger!

25:52.843 --> 25:54.427
Nathan, there's another tiger.

25:54.595 --> 25:56.471
Help, help, help.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.325
We're sorry if we woke you.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.953
Just playing with the boy.

26:22.331 --> 26:23.373
Sergeant...

26:23.540 --> 26:25.708
...I made something for you.

26:33.842 --> 26:37.053
It's to help you walk, you see?

26:37.221 --> 26:38.930
Isn't it? Like this.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.807
See?

27:09.628 --> 27:11.462
Here you go.

27:26.520 --> 27:30.773
I don't see how you cannot
remember how you got here, sergeant.

27:32.234 --> 27:35.069
You're not a deserter,
are you, sergeant?

27:44.830 --> 27:46.164
No, sir.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.125
Then how come you're not with your unit?

27:49.293 --> 27:51.252
Come on, Slade, let the man eat.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.588
It's not an unreasonable question.

28:00.137 --> 28:01.929
How about it, sergeant?

28:03.766 --> 28:05.975
I was replaced.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.437
Replaced?

28:13.108 --> 28:14.776
By a better soldier, sir.

28:22.159 --> 28:26.496
When we left Earth 12 years ago,
we never thought we'd end up here.

28:26.663 --> 28:30.124
When we crashed, a lot of people died.

28:30.834 --> 28:34.337
A few years later, when the dumpers
started coming and dropping stuff...

28:34.505 --> 28:38.341
...people tried to get their
attention with fires and explosions.

28:38.509 --> 28:40.343
But it didn't work.

28:40.511 --> 28:43.388
They must be unmanned or...

28:43.555 --> 28:45.473
...maybe they just don't care.

28:46.642 --> 28:50.311
So we had to forget about a
better life on the Trinity Moons.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.730
One good thing, though.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.149
Nobody bothers us.

28:56.318 --> 28:59.821
Who'd fight for a
godforsaken place like this?

29:14.128 --> 29:15.753
But...

29:15.921 --> 29:18.506
...I guess you like the fighting.

29:19.383 --> 29:22.635
You must. You're...

29:22.803 --> 29:24.846
...a soldier.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.479
The biannual security sweep.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.857
We'll be patrolling the Arcadia system.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.734
We're going to set up unmanned
monitoring stations here...

29:38.902 --> 29:41.362
...here, here, here.

29:41.530 --> 29:44.407
Now, we send the new
soldiers out on patrol.

29:44.575 --> 29:47.743
Routine stuff as you say,
captain, but good experience and...

29:47.911 --> 29:50.830
...I'll have a chance to see them
in a non-training environment.

29:50.998 --> 29:52.623
You're coming?

29:52.791 --> 29:55.376
Yes, captain.

29:55.544 --> 29:58.463
I want to observe
these men at close hand.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.715
Well, what about opposition?

30:02.050 --> 30:04.469
It's all deserted. We're
just confirming that.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.554
But say we do encounter activity.

30:06.722 --> 30:09.348
Miners, refugees of some sort?

30:09.516 --> 30:11.434
Well, we won't.

30:11.602 --> 30:14.937
If we do, they'll be officially
classifiable as hostiles.

30:15.105 --> 30:17.231
Just by being there?

30:17.399 --> 30:20.651
We don't want paperwork, and we
certainly don't want passengers.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.404
Understood?

30:50.933 --> 30:52.642
You have to watch out for those.

30:52.809 --> 30:55.311
They probably wouldn't
kill someone your size.

30:55.479 --> 30:58.689
But someone smaller, like me...

30:59.942 --> 31:01.317
...or Nathan...

31:01.485 --> 31:03.110
He was bitten once...

31:03.278 --> 31:04.904
...and he almost died.

31:06.281 --> 31:08.115
He was sick for a long time.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.576
That's why he can't speak.

31:12.621 --> 31:13.955
Here.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.290
You try one.

31:18.168 --> 31:19.210
Here.

31:40.941 --> 31:44.986
Everything we own, sergeant,
everything in the entire village...

31:45.153 --> 31:47.488
...we've had to salvage from out here.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.994
- You're all set, Jimmy.
- Back in a minute.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.166
Whatever looks useful, if
we can get a chain to it...

31:59.334 --> 32:01.502
...we're gonna go for it.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.259
You hear that?

32:08.427 --> 32:10.261
That means she's really close.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.179
Jimmy, she's gonna blow!

32:12.347 --> 32:14.181
On my way!

32:15.434 --> 32:16.642
Line up!

32:23.734 --> 32:24.900
Come on, Jimmy!

32:26.320 --> 32:28.070
Jimmy, come on!

32:28.238 --> 32:29.780
Come on!

32:38.206 --> 32:39.540
Hurry up! Let's go!

32:43.003 --> 32:45.379
- Mace!
- Give me your hand!

32:45.547 --> 32:47.089
- Too strong!
- Stretch!

32:47.257 --> 32:48.466
Reach, Jimmy!

32:51.720 --> 32:53.679
Mace, I can't reach!

32:55.057 --> 32:59.226
Help!

33:01.063 --> 33:02.146
Pull!

33:07.819 --> 33:10.613
Mace! Help!

33:15.535 --> 33:17.578
Pull!

33:25.921 --> 33:28.422
All right, we got him!

33:44.898 --> 33:47.525
You were almost bacon on that one.

34:05.168 --> 34:06.252
Thank you.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.821
They're dumpers.

34:34.864 --> 34:36.824
They come every 20 or 30 days.

34:38.869 --> 34:41.661
Sergeant, the gun. Please.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.839
Whoo! Thanks, partner.

34:56.887 --> 34:59.805
Them no-goods would've
let me blow away.

37:19.613 --> 37:21.322
Sergeant Todd...

37:23.408 --> 37:24.992
...what's it like?

37:26.411 --> 37:28.287
What's it like being a soldier?

37:29.706 --> 37:32.082
What do you think about?

37:35.086 --> 37:37.296
You must think about something.

37:39.966 --> 37:42.676
What about feelings, then?

37:43.887 --> 37:46.513
You must feel something.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.533
Fear.

38:10.330 --> 38:11.956
Fear?

38:13.458 --> 38:15.876
Fear and discipline.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.423
Now?

38:21.591 --> 38:23.384
Always.

38:27.430 --> 38:28.639
Oh, my God.

38:53.707 --> 38:55.541
Merry Christmas!

38:55.709 --> 38:59.586
Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho!

39:33.955 --> 39:36.123
Merry Christmas, sergeant!

40:50.532 --> 40:54.201
JIMMY: I was gonna give this scarf
to him last night, but he disappeared.

40:54.369 --> 40:56.203
It's beautiful, Jimmy.

40:56.371 --> 40:57.621
He'll love it.

40:57.789 --> 41:02.000
Well, he saved my life out
there. I guess Mace told you.

41:02.168 --> 41:04.253
You should give it to him yourself.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.171
He's in the meeting room.

41:06.339 --> 41:08.465
He's doing exercises.

41:37.954 --> 41:39.580
Children...

41:41.416 --> 41:43.750
You're supposed to
be doing your lessons.

42:58.493 --> 42:59.660
Scarf.

43:35.571 --> 43:37.656
People are upset about him.

43:39.701 --> 43:41.660
There's going to be a meeting.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.371
He's not fully recovered.

43:45.498 --> 43:47.291
That's what scares people.

43:48.710 --> 43:50.585
He gets stronger every day.

43:59.929 --> 44:01.888
Are you scared of him, Mace?

44:05.893 --> 44:07.394
Yes.

44:09.063 --> 44:12.649
I've never been afraid of
anyone before. Not like this.

44:12.817 --> 44:16.695
I feel he could break me in half
with no real effort and no real...

44:17.739 --> 44:19.156
...feeling.

45:10.792 --> 45:14.044
He is most happy when following orders.

45:14.212 --> 45:16.338
A soldier shows no mercy.

45:17.048 --> 45:19.132
Mercy is weakness.

45:19.300 --> 45:21.134
Weakness is death.

45:21.677 --> 45:24.679
A soldier needs no friend or family.

45:24.847 --> 45:26.598
War is his friend.

45:26.766 --> 45:28.308
The Forces are his family.

46:26.159 --> 46:28.743
Todd, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

46:28.911 --> 46:30.829
You could have killed him.

46:40.506 --> 46:43.216
No one here has any animosity
towards you, sergeant.

46:43.384 --> 46:45.969
None of us here is your enemy.

46:46.137 --> 46:48.722
Furthermore, we respect your qualities.

46:48.890 --> 46:53.143
We have no doubt that you
are a very, very good soldier.

46:53.769 --> 46:55.353
But because of your training...

46:55.521 --> 46:58.899
...we don't think you'll ever be able
to function in a group like this...

46:59.066 --> 47:00.734
...a community of families...

47:00.902 --> 47:02.527
...of children...

47:02.695 --> 47:06.990
...where the ability to fight is
not the sole purpose of existence.

47:07.158 --> 47:08.742
You're different from us, sergeant.

47:08.910 --> 47:10.952
We don't hate you for that.

47:11.120 --> 47:14.331
But we have agreed that
to try to include you...

47:14.499 --> 47:18.752
...would pose an intolerable
risk to the community itself.

47:20.421 --> 47:22.464
We'll give you any tools you need:

47:23.633 --> 47:27.219
Some warm clothing,
some boots, a good knife.

47:36.938 --> 47:39.022
Sergeant, you're our friend.

47:41.484 --> 47:43.443
It's just...

47:56.207 --> 47:59.251
If you need us, you can ask us for help.

49:47.652 --> 49:51.863
Command, we are on
course for Arcadia 234.

50:55.177 --> 50:58.555
- How will you find him?
- He'll have stayed close to the wire.

50:58.723 --> 51:00.557
What'll I tell the council?

51:00.725 --> 51:03.893
- We all voted.
- We voted wrong.

51:40.681 --> 51:42.849
Todd!

51:47.563 --> 51:49.439
Todd...

51:51.692 --> 51:53.109
We were wrong.

51:56.322 --> 51:58.573
We made a mistake.

52:04.330 --> 52:05.413
We're sorry.

52:32.817 --> 52:34.984
It's some kind of landing party.

52:35.152 --> 52:37.445
Hey! Over here!

52:51.836 --> 52:53.837
Stay with me, sir.

53:35.629 --> 53:40.300
All units stand by for
Arcadia 234 security sweep.

53:40.467 --> 53:43.720
Any trespassers will
be considered hostile.

54:12.166 --> 54:13.416
Wait! What's going on?

54:13.584 --> 54:16.336
Somebody's landing.
Jimmy Pig spotted a ship.

54:43.030 --> 54:44.948
Two hostiles at 12:00.

55:25.322 --> 55:27.573
Hostiles eliminated.

56:19.793 --> 56:20.960
It's no good.

56:21.128 --> 56:22.837
I've lost too much blood.

56:24.423 --> 56:25.548
Why?

56:29.678 --> 56:31.220
Was it a mistake?

56:46.111 --> 56:48.446
Oh, God, no.

56:48.614 --> 56:49.947
Not Sandra.

56:50.115 --> 56:51.908
Please...

56:52.076 --> 56:53.826
...not Nathan.

56:53.994 --> 56:55.411
Please...

57:18.644 --> 57:21.062
People! They spotted people.

57:21.230 --> 57:22.730
Two civilians, unarmed.

57:22.898 --> 57:26.234
They killed both of them. They
spotted smoke from some sort of camp.

57:26.401 --> 57:27.902
Jesus Christ. A camp?

57:28.070 --> 57:29.278
Excellent.

57:29.446 --> 57:31.531
This'll be very good
experience for the men.

57:31.698 --> 57:33.199
Let's see how they do.

57:33.367 --> 57:34.784
Civilians need to be protected.

57:34.952 --> 57:38.955
Whoever they are, they don't belong
there. Officially, they're hostiles.

57:48.340 --> 57:50.508
Three-man fire team only.

57:50.676 --> 57:52.135
Prepare to deploy.

57:55.556 --> 57:56.556
Everybody!

57:56.723 --> 57:58.766
Calm down!

57:58.934 --> 58:01.060
Calm down.

58:01.395 --> 58:03.729
I'm going to go out and talk to them.

58:03.897 --> 58:06.357
Those of you with weapons,
prepare to defend us.

58:26.253 --> 58:27.587
God help us.

58:59.828 --> 59:02.997
Three-man fire team in position.

59:03.290 --> 59:05.666
Crawler to fire team.

59:05.834 --> 59:07.460
Engage.

59:10.214 --> 59:12.965
Everything under control.

59:13.133 --> 59:15.259
- Is there resistance?
- Ineffectual.

59:15.427 --> 59:17.011
Three men are going
in to clean them out.

59:17.179 --> 59:19.347
Caine's ordered the rest to hold back.

59:19.514 --> 59:22.308
Sounds reckless. Three against 50.

59:22.476 --> 59:24.894
I can tell these men
have no combat experience.

59:25.312 --> 59:27.146
The old ones, the veterans...

59:27.314 --> 59:30.816
...they would've called
for support, just in case.

59:30.984 --> 59:32.151
Speaking of the old ones...

59:32.319 --> 59:35.446
...why don't we have Riley and his
crew put up the monitoring unit?

59:38.367 --> 59:40.493
Atten-hut!

59:43.163 --> 59:44.288
Sir.

59:45.582 --> 59:46.582
Riley?

59:46.750 --> 59:49.210
- Will we be issued weapons, sir?
- No, Riley.

59:49.378 --> 59:51.337
Only soldiers get weapons.

59:51.505 --> 59:53.130
Yes, sir.

59:56.009 --> 59:58.678
You don't even have to
salute anymore, Riley.

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:33.087
Now!

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:05.745
You need any help, partner?

01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:15.129
Okay.

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:24.638
Riley and team deploying monitor unit.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.897
Don't panic!

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.107
Up the stairs. Come on.

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:36.609
Will, take him.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:46.452
Go, go!

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.662
Get inside the bedroom!

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:56.605
Come in, Unit 703.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.941
Unit 703, do you copy?

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:08.200
A growl?

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:10.786
He heard a growl?

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:12.037
Well...

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:15.040
...he didn't say the word
"growl." He said, "a throat noise."

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:19.962
But I asked him to imitate it,
and it sounded like a growl to me.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:26.218
We're obviously up against a
significant military presence here.

01:03:27.596 --> 01:03:30.014
Well, let's send in the rest of the men.

01:03:30.182 --> 01:03:31.348
Absolutely not.

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:36.228
Those bastards are just
waiting for us in there.

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:37.646
No.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:39.565
We don't fall for an ambush.

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:40.983
Colonel...

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:42.610
...my daddy always said:

01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:45.321
"When you want to insert a
nail into a piece of wood...

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:48.115
...you don't do anything
fancy or glamorous.

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:50.993
Just take the damn hammer and hit
the son of a bitch till it's in."

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:54.622
What exactly does that crap
mean in English, captain?

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:56.582
Withdraw your men.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.918
Load them up with heavy artillery.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:03.088
At night, they'll go back and pound that
place with mortars, rockets, cannons...

01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:04.965
...everything we got...

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:07.384
...from a safe distance.

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.512
It ain't fancy...

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:12.723
...but it will sure take care
of your hostile military force.

01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:15.351
All right, do it. Withdraw the men.

01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:29.490
Push really hard, okay? Hard.

01:04:57.435 --> 01:04:58.811
Nathan.

01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:11.031
They killed him, didn't they?

01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:42.688
How do you know they'll be back?

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:45.899
Because they're soldiers, sir, like me.

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:50.654
- Why are they doing this?
- They're obeying orders, sir.

01:05:50.822 --> 01:05:52.406
It's their duty.

01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:55.534
Do you know how many they'll be?

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:57.036
Seventeen more, sir.

01:05:57.203 --> 01:06:00.331
You can't fight 17 on your own.

01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:04.543
You have to organize
us. We're not cowards.

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:06.086
We'll do as you tell us.

01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:07.880
- We'll fight.
- No.

01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:12.718
Why not?

01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:15.846
Soldiers deserve soldiers, sir.

01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:18.724
But one soldier...

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:21.477
...against 17?

01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:24.355
What are you gonna do?

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:30.402
I'm going to kill them all, sir.

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:43.582
Crawlers 1 and 2...

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.209
...proceed to settlement...

01:06:45.377 --> 01:06:47.670
...and commence bombardment.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:13.278
Crawler 1, we are red.

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:15.030
We are red.

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:16.657
Crawler 2 to Crawler 1.

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:19.827
- Report.
- Crawler 2, we are two down.

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.370
Responding to sniper activity.

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:23.622
Crawlers 1 and 2, split up.

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:25.999
Crawler 1, locate and
neutralize the sniper.

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:27.167
Caine 607...

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:29.586
...proceed to the settlement
and commence bombardment.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:31.964
Roger, 1. We're proceeding to target.

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:50.065
Crawler 1, deploying ground forces.

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:42.863
All units...

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:44.323
...report.

01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:47.034
438, negative.

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:49.953
515, negative.

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:52.873
523, negative.

01:10:59.005 --> 01:11:00.672
Squad 1, to your 9.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.175
Squad 2, stand by with covering fire.

01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:20.025
Enemy sniper at 12:00.

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:25.197
Sniper located.

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.819
- Ambush!
- Retreat.

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:04.629
I think we have to assume
that the missing men are down.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:08.091
Maybe you should've made
them smart instead of fast.

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:18.477
Squad 1, do you copy?

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:21.480
Squad 2, do you copy?

01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:23.899
Squad 3, do you copy?

01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:27.152
607 to Command. 1.5
clicks from settlement.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.780
Will engage enemy in
approximately two minutes.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.324
Roger, 607.

01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:38.538
Crawler 1 to Command.

01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:41.291
We have lost radio contact
with all ground units.

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:44.002
We are still searching for the sniper.

01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:56.051
Crawler 2 to Crawler 1. Come in, 1.

01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:57.219
One.

01:15:57.386 --> 01:16:01.014
Two to 1. Take your port to
our 9:00 and commence firing.

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:04.851
MAN: Affirmative, 2. Port
to 9 and commence firing.

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:23.995
Crawler 2 to Crawler 1.

01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:26.164
Again, proceed to port 9.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:27.707
Affirmative.

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:30.001
Proceed to port 9.

01:16:36.676 --> 01:16:38.176
Where's my father?

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:49.854
Two to 1.

01:16:50.022 --> 01:16:52.732
You're still on 12:00. Correct, 9.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.985
Affirmative, 2.

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:04.452
Crawler 1.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.788
You're on a collision course with me.

01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:08.790
Affirmative, 2.

01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:53.710
Crawler 1, do you copy?

01:17:53.878 --> 01:17:55.670
Crawler 2, do you copy?

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:58.548
Are any of you men out there?

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:01.426
Can any of you men hear me?

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:04.596
Your men...

01:18:04.764 --> 01:18:06.431
...are obsolete.

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:10.977
Try Number 1.

01:18:11.145 --> 01:18:12.812
I tried Number 1. I can't get either.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.732
This is bad. We don't know
what we're up against. How many?

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.776
They couldn't get
figures on enemy troops.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:20.737
We're sitting ducks. There could
be a few divisions out there.

01:18:20.905 --> 01:18:23.740
We don't even have the weapons
to arm the old soldiers.

01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:25.116
Is that a recrimination?

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:27.327
Because if it is, I will
have you court-martialed.

01:18:27.495 --> 01:18:28.495
No, sir.

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:30.455
All right, don't panic. Don't panic.

01:18:30.623 --> 01:18:32.874
I am not panicking.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.671
- Captain.
- Sir.

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:22.507
You must have some of
those new DX-57s on board.

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:24.134
Planet killers, you mean.

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:25.760
We carry 15.

01:19:25.928 --> 01:19:27.512
One's enough.

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:31.266
We set it on a short fuse
and we get out of here.

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:33.518
Boom. We win.

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:48.116
Brave. It means that
even when you're scared...

01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:50.326
...you control your emotions.

01:19:50.494 --> 01:19:53.204
You make the fear be
really small and tiny.

01:19:54.582 --> 01:19:56.374
- Oh, no.
- Shh.

01:20:41.921 --> 01:20:43.254
We should go, sir.

01:21:04.151 --> 01:21:05.276
Take him.

01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:11.950
Go back.

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:21.042
Go back! Go back!

01:26:03.575 --> 01:26:05.743
Right horizontal.

01:26:05.911 --> 01:26:08.579
Roger. Right horizontal checks green.

01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:09.789
What are we waiting for?

01:26:09.957 --> 01:26:11.082
Give us a go.

01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:13.501
We'll give Riley and his
men seven more minutes.

01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:16.921
- Fuck them. Let's just go.
- Abandon them?

01:26:17.089 --> 01:26:19.423
I'll pretend I didn't hear
that. I'm the captain...

01:26:19.591 --> 01:26:24.262
I'm your superior officer. It's
my mission, my call. I say go.

01:26:24.429 --> 01:26:26.681
Losing men in combat is one
thing, abandoning them...

01:26:26.849 --> 01:26:29.350
I'm not gonna die because
of your pompous bullshit.

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:33.062
This is a direct order.
Understand? Take off now.

01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:39.360
Don't walk away from me, you
sniveling, West Point piece of...

01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:53.374
Take the helm, Sloan.

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:55.501
Let's launch this thing.

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.504
Come on! On the double! Let's go!

01:27:04.303 --> 01:27:06.012
Close up the lower hatch.

01:27:08.265 --> 01:27:09.974
Punch up your port power cluster.

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:12.226
- What was that?
- What was what?

01:27:18.609 --> 01:27:20.985
- What do you think you're doing?
- Get off of me!

01:27:21.153 --> 01:27:25.031
Fucking morons! Get your hands off
me! Ten minutes to go, understand?

01:27:25.198 --> 01:27:27.909
You're killing yourselves by doing this.

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:29.702
What are you doing?

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:41.339
You?

01:27:54.978 --> 01:27:56.520
Please.

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:09.450
Please.

01:28:15.207 --> 01:28:17.208
- No.
- No!

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:41.107
No, don't leave us!

01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:50.825
We gotta get out of here.

01:28:50.993 --> 01:28:52.910
Colonel!

01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:24.859
It's getting ready to
detonate. We've gotta stop it.

01:29:25.027 --> 01:29:27.111
Fourteen seconds! Hurry!

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:30.740
I can't remember
if it's 6-7 or 7-6!

01:29:30.907 --> 01:29:34.160
- Get out of the way.
- No, you don't know what you're doing.

01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:36.454
Hurry, hurry.

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:54.240
There.

01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:55.991
Aye-aye, sir.

01:30:56.159 --> 01:30:58.828
Setting course for the Trinity Moons.
