00:01.585 --> 00:03.009
<i>- Previously on Dracula:</i>

00:03.321 --> 00:06.924
<i>- We have schemed and built</i>
<i>this empire of lies...</i>

00:06.926 --> 00:10.119
Give me one good reason
I should not peel you like a grape!

00:10.212 --> 00:11.211
- Because without me...

00:12.033 --> 00:14.736
- You'd still be rotting
in that iron box.

00:21.972 --> 00:25.596
- From this day forward, you
are an American industrialist.

00:25.762 --> 00:29.964
Ladies and gentleman,
Mr. Alexander Grayson.

00:29.966 --> 00:35.236
- I give to you free,
wireless power.

00:36.606 --> 00:37.743
- You are a fraud, sir,

00:38.708 --> 00:40.608
and I will see to it
that you never

00:40.610 --> 00:42.243
do business here.

00:42.245 --> 00:43.645
- Rape, torture,

00:43.647 --> 00:45.013
wholesale slaughter,

00:45.015 --> 00:48.149
that is the stock-in-trade
of the order of the dragon.

00:48.151 --> 00:51.719
They employ business,
politics, and oil,

00:51.721 --> 00:54.956
and that last thing, Renfield,
will be their undoing.

00:54.958 --> 00:57.091
- Sir clive not a day
in the ground, and Grayson

00:57.093 --> 01:00.662
locked up olive's entire block
of imperial coolant.

01:00.664 --> 01:03.932
- I trust you were unobserved?

01:03.934 --> 01:05.600
- How long has it been
since a vampire stalked

01:05.602 --> 01:08.069
the streets of this city?
Seven years?

01:08.071 --> 01:09.571
- Eight years.

01:09.573 --> 01:11.706
- What do you suggest?
- I will put kruger on patrol.

01:16.278 --> 01:19.581
- You are... Dracula.

01:19.583 --> 01:21.115
- I will destroy your order

01:21.117 --> 01:23.485
and everything it stands for.

01:23.487 --> 01:26.020
- This is my most lovely friend,
miss Mina Murray.

01:26.022 --> 01:27.589
- If you don't ask her
to marry you soon,

01:27.591 --> 01:29.075
someone else is bound to.

02:48.971 --> 02:51.739
- Surely you recognize
the blades of Saint eligius.

02:51.741 --> 02:56.377
Exquisite, aren't they?

02:56.379 --> 02:59.747
Now then,
let me introduce myself.

02:59.749 --> 03:02.250
My name is Abraham van Helsing.

03:02.252 --> 03:06.054
- I will tear your heart out,
peasant!

03:06.056 --> 03:09.724
- And you are vlad the third,

03:09.726 --> 03:14.696
prince of wallachia, second son
of the house of basarab,

03:14.698 --> 03:18.399
also known as Vlad Tepes,

03:18.401 --> 03:22.103
Vlad the Impaler...
Dracula.

03:26.375 --> 03:30.078
Soon the sun will take you,

03:30.080 --> 03:33.247
and you will be no more.

03:33.249 --> 03:35.116
But at least in your case,

03:35.118 --> 03:38.052
unlike my own,
there will be one

03:38.054 --> 03:39.420
who deeply mourns your passing.

03:41.424 --> 03:43.725
- For with your death,

03:43.727 --> 03:45.660
so too will pass my last chance

03:45.662 --> 03:47.586
to obliterate the order
of the Dragon.

03:48.583 --> 03:50.950
- What is the Ordo Draco
to you?

03:50.952 --> 03:54.745
- They slaughtered my wife,
Adalind,

03:54.906 --> 03:56.107
and my three children.

03:56.256 --> 03:59.023
They stole from me everything in
this world that I have loved.

03:59.260 --> 04:01.627
Everything you have loved.

04:08.570 --> 04:11.170
- No!

04:15.742 --> 04:18.277
Ilona.

04:18.279 --> 04:21.714
- They burned her alive,
as they did my adalind.

04:21.716 --> 04:23.516
And if you die this day,

04:23.518 --> 04:24.851
they will never face justice

04:24.853 --> 04:28.488
for these and all
the other vile crimes

04:28.490 --> 04:30.347
they have committed
in the lord's name.

04:32.126 --> 04:34.260
- No man can change that.

04:34.262 --> 04:36.562
- True.

04:36.564 --> 04:39.632
But you are far greater
than any mortal man.

04:41.536 --> 04:44.971
- Though I possess the means,

04:44.973 --> 04:47.807
I lack the power, the presence,
and the ruthlessness

04:47.809 --> 04:49.108
to wield it to any effect.

04:49.110 --> 04:51.210
Only you and I...

04:51.212 --> 04:54.280
Together, can destroy them.

04:56.250 --> 04:59.552
- You say you have means.

04:59.554 --> 05:02.054
- I do.

05:02.056 --> 05:04.657
- Then stop wasting my time.

05:04.659 --> 05:06.325
Remove this cursed blade

05:06.327 --> 05:08.628
before your confederate

05:08.630 --> 05:11.697
is rendered to ash!
Aah!

05:39.226 --> 05:41.794
- Every move you make
is another card

05:41.796 --> 05:43.863
face up on the table.

05:43.865 --> 05:47.300
Sir clive is slaughtered.
There is a vampire in London.

05:47.302 --> 05:50.102
Then Kruger, a huntsman.

05:50.104 --> 05:52.572
- I had no choice.
- He saw my face.

05:52.574 --> 05:55.107
- A seasoned huntsman!

05:55.109 --> 05:56.943
Now they will activate
their seers,

05:56.945 --> 05:58.077
if they haven't already.

05:58.079 --> 05:59.645
- I can deal with them.

05:59.647 --> 06:00.947
- And no doubt reveal

06:00.949 --> 06:02.381
yet another measure
of your power.

06:02.383 --> 06:04.050
We require stealth.

06:04.052 --> 06:06.487
You deliver mayhem.

06:07.255 --> 06:10.723
Our sole purpose in London
is to make geomagnetic power

06:10.725 --> 06:12.124
a practical reality

06:12.126 --> 06:15.728
and wipe out the order's
investments in oil.

06:15.730 --> 06:19.065
Damn it.
Cursed sludge.

06:19.067 --> 06:22.268
Like tapping a wretched corpse.

06:22.270 --> 06:23.669
- You're lucky I fed.

06:23.671 --> 06:26.072
- Your other arm.
- Must I?

06:26.074 --> 06:28.941
- Stop being a baby.

06:30.278 --> 06:34.614
Knives, swords, lances, stakes,

06:34.616 --> 06:36.315
a century in a metal box.

06:36.317 --> 06:38.128
Mere annoyances.

06:39.153 --> 06:42.054
But your needles will be
the death of me.

06:42.056 --> 06:43.889
- It cannot be helped.

06:43.891 --> 06:48.651
Your blood is a necessary component
if you are ever to conquer daylight.

06:48.802 --> 06:51.471
- It's not the blood you draw
that vexes me, Van Helsing,

06:52.066 --> 06:55.768
but the sublime pleasure
you draw from its taking.

06:55.770 --> 06:58.838
Must your progress be
so painfully slow?

06:58.840 --> 07:00.006
- You must have patience.

07:00.008 --> 07:01.207
- When?

07:01.209 --> 07:02.642
- When it's done.

07:02.644 --> 07:05.978
- You've been telling me that
for a decade.

07:05.980 --> 07:07.380
It's only a matter of time

07:07.382 --> 07:11.684
before my aversion to sunlight
becomes obvious.

07:11.686 --> 07:12.918
When?

07:12.920 --> 07:15.354
- You must have patience.

07:23.398 --> 07:27.133
- Order!
- Excuse me, mama.

07:30.203 --> 07:31.054
- Ready?

07:32.144 --> 07:33.573
<i>Allez!</i>

07:36.209 --> 07:39.278
- Alastair,
you look positively ferocious.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.113
- Shall I have the pleasure
of wearing your colors?

07:41.115 --> 07:42.214
- Huh.

07:42.216 --> 07:43.749
It's all for a good cause,
I know,

07:43.751 --> 07:45.685
but I would like
to see them advance

07:45.687 --> 07:47.953
beyond the semi-final,
at least.

07:47.955 --> 07:49.955
- And what, fair lady,
shall be my prize,

07:49.957 --> 07:52.191
should I triumph?

08:00.233 --> 08:02.168
- Seriously?

08:02.170 --> 08:03.269
<i>Touche!</i>

08:10.043 --> 08:12.144
<i>En garde!</i>

08:12.146 --> 08:13.212
- Mina.

08:13.214 --> 08:14.213
- Hello, Minerva.
- <i>Allez!</i>

08:14.215 --> 08:15.915
- My dear, whatever happened?

08:15.917 --> 08:17.283
- Oh, it's nothing, really.

08:17.285 --> 08:18.350
Just a little accident
at university.

08:18.352 --> 08:21.187
I was practicing
my surgical technique,

08:21.189 --> 08:23.456
and I managed to cut myself
to ribbons.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.257
Silly.

08:25.259 --> 08:26.959
But at any rate,
it did give me a chance

08:26.961 --> 08:30.730
to brush up on my suturing.

08:30.732 --> 08:31.931
- Stitches?

08:31.933 --> 08:33.365
- Yes.
- I stitched it right up.

08:33.366 --> 08:34.467
Across the thumb at least.

08:34.469 --> 08:36.001
- Oh, good lord, please stop.

08:36.003 --> 08:38.070
We've only just finished
luncheon.

08:44.010 --> 08:45.377
- Mina!

08:45.379 --> 08:47.980
What kept you?

08:47.982 --> 08:50.182
- I found my champion.
- Only one?

08:50.184 --> 08:51.751
Oh, don't tell me
you put all three ribbons

08:51.753 --> 08:52.918
on one man again.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.120
- Well, why hedge

08:54.122 --> 08:56.188
when the outcome of the wager
is certain?

08:56.190 --> 08:58.290
Shh, he's up.

08:58.292 --> 09:00.259
It's Alastair.

09:00.261 --> 09:02.361
- Of course.

09:02.363 --> 09:04.296
- His opponent
is Daniel Davenport,

09:04.298 --> 09:07.533
the son of lord Davenport
and the reigning champion.

09:07.535 --> 09:10.770
- Not for long.
- Alastair's very motivated.

09:12.539 --> 09:13.396
- Ready?

09:13.675 --> 09:14.824
<i>Allez!</i>

09:16.944 --> 09:18.844
- Our agents haven't reported
a single incident

09:18.846 --> 09:19.979
since it bested kruger.

09:19.981 --> 09:22.448
- He's gone to ground.
- Perhaps, yes.

09:22.450 --> 09:25.351
Or gone altogether.

09:25.516 --> 09:26.777
- <i>Touche!</i>

09:28.456 --> 09:30.122
- I take it, then, you'll
be summoning another huntsman

09:30.124 --> 09:31.123
to replace Kruger?

09:31.125 --> 09:33.359
Perhaps MacLachlan
from Glasgow?

09:33.361 --> 09:35.594
- I'd rather I handled
this one myself.

09:35.596 --> 09:39.098
It is about time
I had some fun for a change.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.400
- That's my girl.

09:43.170 --> 09:44.361
- <i>Touche!</i>

09:47.175 --> 09:48.440
- He's doing very well.

09:48.442 --> 09:50.177
- You're so mean.

09:52.146 --> 09:53.238
- <i>Allez!</i>

09:56.616 --> 09:58.584
- I presume you have
no objection

09:58.586 --> 10:01.253
to my deployment of the seers?

10:01.255 --> 10:03.255
- Must you?

10:03.257 --> 10:05.357
There is more than a whiff
of sulfur about those two.

10:05.359 --> 10:07.226
- But better the devil you know.

10:08.629 --> 10:12.031
Very well.
If you must.

10:14.234 --> 10:16.569
- <i>Touche!</i>

10:16.571 --> 10:18.938
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

10:21.842 --> 10:23.409
Good show, son!

10:23.411 --> 10:26.045
Jolly good!

10:36.656 --> 10:40.426
- Well fought, Davenport.
- Great job.

10:40.428 --> 10:42.595
- Well done.

10:46.933 --> 10:48.467
- Don't be ridiculous.
- This is my treat.

10:48.469 --> 10:52.605
- No, no, please.
- Absolutely not.

10:52.607 --> 10:55.274
- I insist.
- Thank you, madam.

10:56.376 --> 11:00.079
- Thank you,
Mrs. Westenra.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.521
- I'll look forward
to lunch next week.

11:09.523 --> 11:11.690
Good-bye.

11:11.692 --> 11:13.525
Oh!
I thought I'd missed you!

11:13.527 --> 11:17.329
- I was just leaving, actually.

11:17.331 --> 11:19.398
- Later, then.
- Of course.

11:56.003 --> 11:57.736
- So, did you get the raise?

11:57.738 --> 12:00.973
- He says he'll look into it.
- Sorry, mate.

12:00.975 --> 12:03.175
- At this rate, by the time
I'll be able to afford a wife,

12:03.177 --> 12:05.277
Mina and I will be
in advanced old age.

12:05.279 --> 12:06.946
- I wouldn't say that.

12:06.948 --> 12:09.548
Well, not both of you,
at least.

12:09.550 --> 12:11.483
You do have a few years
on the girl.

12:16.990 --> 12:19.658
- Mr. Renfield,
this is my co-chairman

12:19.660 --> 12:22.227
on the board of British imperial
coolant company,

12:22.229 --> 12:24.063
Lord Laurent.

12:24.065 --> 12:27.433
- Pleasure.
- Please, sit.

12:27.435 --> 12:29.969
- I'm sorry, but I really
don't have much time.

12:29.971 --> 12:32.705
My driver is waiting,
and you indicated in your wire

12:32.707 --> 12:34.473
that this was a matter
of some urgency.

12:34.475 --> 12:36.475
- It is.

12:36.477 --> 12:37.643
Namely, I've become
uncomfortable

12:37.645 --> 12:40.179
with our business relationship.

12:40.181 --> 12:41.714
It's nothing personal,
of course.

12:41.716 --> 12:44.116
I just don't like partners
in general.

12:44.118 --> 12:46.385
- I see.

12:46.387 --> 12:47.753
So you wish
to sell your shares?

12:47.755 --> 12:49.254
Well, I'd be happy to offer...

12:49.256 --> 12:52.224
- no, no, no, no, no.

12:52.226 --> 12:55.794
I have no interest in selling
my interest.

12:55.796 --> 12:57.596
I was rather hoping
that you would entertain

12:57.598 --> 13:01.033
an offer for your interest.

13:01.035 --> 13:04.103
Renfield?

13:06.006 --> 13:07.206
- Certainly not!

13:07.208 --> 13:09.041
- You haven't even looked
at the offer.

13:10.378 --> 13:13.479
I do not need
to see your offer, sir.

13:13.481 --> 13:16.215
My interests are not for sale,
at any price.

13:16.217 --> 13:17.349
- See, Renfield?

13:17.351 --> 13:20.819
Not for sale, at any price!

13:22.523 --> 13:25.057
- Good day, sir.

13:43.843 --> 13:47.346
If I may ask a question, sir?

13:47.348 --> 13:50.582
I'd rather you didn't,
yet I know somehow you will.

13:50.584 --> 13:53.485
- I still don't understand
your circumspection.

13:53.487 --> 13:56.522
Why engage Harker to bring
the woman into your orbit?

13:56.524 --> 14:01.493
Surely you have the power
to simply take her.

14:01.495 --> 14:02.793
- I can't.

14:05.399 --> 14:09.368
I know it sounds absurd
that someone such as I

14:09.370 --> 14:13.439
would hesitate to act
on moral grounds,

14:13.441 --> 14:15.674
but to simply take the woman,

14:15.676 --> 14:20.279
to turn her into such
as I am...

14:20.281 --> 14:23.582
It would be an abomination.

14:23.584 --> 14:26.685
No, Renfield, I cannot...

14:26.687 --> 14:28.454
I will not... take her.

14:28.456 --> 14:31.623
- Yet still you seek
to draw her in.

14:31.625 --> 14:34.093
To what possible end?

14:36.330 --> 14:39.765
Now, that I cannot say.

14:39.767 --> 14:43.202
I only know to lose her twice

14:43.204 --> 14:46.472
would be more
than I could bear.

15:04.458 --> 15:08.427
- If you move this across,
then...

15:08.429 --> 15:10.429
- Mr. Harker?
- Yes?

15:10.431 --> 15:13.632
- If you don't mind.

15:16.536 --> 15:19.738
Chop, chop.

15:21.241 --> 15:24.176
- I take it our interview
was a feather in your cap?

15:24.178 --> 15:25.768
- My editor was quite pleased.

15:26.914 --> 15:27.947
- But?

15:29.283 --> 15:30.883
- Well, I was hoping
for something

15:30.885 --> 15:32.918
rather more tangible
than a feather.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.453
- As you should.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.455
It's perfectly reasonable
to expect a reward

15:36.457 --> 15:38.824
when one demonstrates
initiative.

15:38.826 --> 15:41.560
A man should never be ashamed
of ambition...

15:41.562 --> 15:43.629
only the lack of it.

15:43.631 --> 15:44.797
- Well, that may be true
in America...

15:44.798 --> 15:45.964
- no, Harker.

15:45.966 --> 15:48.467
It's simply true, everywhere.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.736
In every man's heart.

15:50.738 --> 15:53.505
Even in yours.

15:54.908 --> 15:56.408
Especially yours.

15:56.410 --> 15:59.478
If you don't mind, I have a little
business matter to attend to.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.580
- Of course.
- Ah, Mr. Grayson.

16:01.582 --> 16:03.882
- You've met my man, Renfield?
- I have.

16:03.884 --> 16:05.817
- This is my young friend,
Mr. Harker.

16:05.819 --> 16:07.419
- How do you do?

16:07.421 --> 16:09.888
- Shall we?
- By all means.

16:09.890 --> 16:11.490
- This is the main entry hall.

16:11.492 --> 16:14.493
As you can see,
it's quite spacious.

16:14.495 --> 16:18.430
To the left
is the drawing room.

16:18.432 --> 16:20.465
There's a full cellar,
of course,

16:20.467 --> 16:22.501
including kitchen and pantry,

16:22.503 --> 16:24.703
four bedrooms upstairs,

16:24.705 --> 16:28.373
and servants' quarters
are on the second floor.

16:28.375 --> 16:30.409
- Thank you.

16:30.411 --> 16:31.677
I must say,

16:31.679 --> 16:33.445
I was keenly impressed
by your insights

16:33.447 --> 16:35.981
regarding Mr. Clive's, uh...

16:35.983 --> 16:38.784
how shall I put this?

16:38.786 --> 16:40.719
Marked fondness
for games of chance.

16:40.721 --> 16:42.621
It was nothing, really.

16:42.623 --> 16:44.389
- Quite the contrary.

16:44.391 --> 16:45.791
They proved very helpful indeed

16:45.793 --> 16:47.993
in persuading his widow
in selling me his interests

16:47.995 --> 16:50.495
in a company I had my eye on.

16:50.497 --> 16:51.897
- British imperial coolant?

16:51.899 --> 16:53.665
- The very same.

16:53.667 --> 16:58.003
Of course, I don't yet
have a controlling interest.

16:58.005 --> 17:00.372
Which is where you come in.

17:00.374 --> 17:02.241
Gentlemen,
is everything in order?

17:02.243 --> 17:05.377
- Yes, sir.

17:05.378 --> 17:09.647
- I need a vice president
of public affairs,

17:09.650 --> 17:12.384
a man with a certain finesse
and a thorough knowledge

17:12.386 --> 17:15.753
of who's who and what's what.

17:15.756 --> 17:17.489
The primary duties
of the position

17:17.491 --> 17:19.590
will be to assist me
in navigating a course

17:19.593 --> 17:21.460
through British society

17:21.462 --> 17:24.363
and her business community.

17:24.365 --> 17:26.265
- Enjoy your new home,
Mr. Grayson.

17:26.267 --> 17:27.432
- Hmm.

17:27.434 --> 17:29.968
- I shall see
to all the details

17:29.970 --> 17:31.370
with the executor.

17:31.372 --> 17:33.905
- Thank you.

17:33.907 --> 17:34.973
- Oh, hold on a minute.
- Is... is this...

17:34.975 --> 17:37.709
- sir Clive's old place.

17:37.711 --> 17:40.579
Got it for a song, really.

17:40.581 --> 17:44.516
A little paint,
a little polish...

17:44.518 --> 17:47.552
so, Harker...

17:47.554 --> 17:49.721
It's yours.

17:49.723 --> 17:52.924
If you accept my offer.

17:52.926 --> 17:54.660
I can't have my attache
living in a hovel,

17:54.662 --> 17:57.796
now, can I?

18:03.903 --> 18:05.671
- Um...
- Is that a yes?

18:05.673 --> 18:09.508
- Uh, no.
- I-I mean...

18:09.510 --> 18:12.077
I'm sorry.
This is very unexpected.

18:12.079 --> 18:13.478
- Think about it.

18:24.024 --> 18:25.657
Of course, the position comes

18:25.659 --> 18:27.459
with a generous salary.

18:27.461 --> 18:29.695
However,
I cannot wait indefinitely

18:29.697 --> 18:31.096
for an answer.

18:31.098 --> 18:33.532
So I'll need yours
by Monday morning.

18:33.534 --> 18:35.367
Is that okay with you?

18:35.369 --> 18:37.569
- Yes, of course.

18:37.571 --> 18:40.405
- Do me a favor,
will you, Harker?

18:40.407 --> 18:43.475
Turn out the lights
and lock up.

19:03.567 --> 19:04.948
I just know
I'm going to botch it.

19:06.132 --> 19:08.033
I will be lucky to pass,
much less be chosent.

19:08.035 --> 19:09.822
As Professor Van Helsing's
protegee.

19:10.537 --> 19:12.504
- You... you'll do fine.

19:12.506 --> 19:15.640
- No, Jonathan, I most decidedly
will not do fine.

19:15.642 --> 19:17.843
The cardiovascular system
is the most complex structure

19:17.845 --> 19:18.977
I've studied this term,

19:18.979 --> 19:21.046
and surgical skills
are not my forte.

19:21.048 --> 19:22.748
They never have been.

19:22.750 --> 19:24.082
If I don't pass
this examination,

19:24.084 --> 19:26.131
I won't advance
past fourth year.

19:28.422 --> 19:31.690
Jonathan.

19:31.692 --> 19:34.493
You haven't heard
a word I've said.

19:34.495 --> 19:35.827
- Of... of course I have.

19:35.829 --> 19:38.130
You've got a test
on the interior thingamabob,

19:38.132 --> 19:39.664
and I'm quite certain
that you'll leave

19:39.666 --> 19:42.167
all the other students
in the shade.

19:44.538 --> 19:46.171
- I got the most
extraordinary offer.

19:46.173 --> 19:48.039
- What?

19:48.041 --> 19:49.875
- Mr. Grayson
has offered me a position

19:49.877 --> 19:51.810
in his firm.

19:51.812 --> 19:54.079
- Alexander Grayson?

19:54.081 --> 19:57.516
- Yeah. Yes.

19:57.518 --> 19:58.717
- What?

19:58.719 --> 20:02.521
Well, then,
you simply must take it.

20:02.523 --> 20:04.656
- Don't you even want to know
what it entails?

20:04.658 --> 20:06.024
- Of course I do.

20:06.026 --> 20:08.660
Tell me everything about it.

20:29.015 --> 20:31.716
- You didn't answer my summons.

20:31.718 --> 20:33.952
- We only just lit that.

20:35.989 --> 20:37.923
- There is a vampire in London.

20:37.925 --> 20:41.059
You shall find him forthwith.

20:41.061 --> 20:43.061
- We can't.
- We've been ill.

20:43.063 --> 20:44.729
Sick as pikes.

20:44.731 --> 20:46.097
But as soon as we're
up to snuff...

20:46.099 --> 20:48.200
- yes, well, I think that snuff

20:48.202 --> 20:51.470
is half the problem.

20:51.472 --> 20:53.472
You will find him,

20:53.474 --> 20:55.207
or you will answer
to Mr. Browning

20:55.209 --> 20:57.126
and the high council.

21:07.820 --> 21:11.022
- Jonathan, you would be
perfect for that.

21:11.024 --> 21:12.858
- Doesn't it...
- Doesn't it just feel

21:12.860 --> 21:15.060
a bit dodgy?

21:15.062 --> 21:16.761
- But he's a visionary.

21:16.763 --> 21:19.264
He's a brilliant
business tactician.

21:19.266 --> 21:21.166
Every concern he's had a hand in
has prospered.

21:21.168 --> 21:24.135
- Yeah, for the past
seven or eight years, yes.

21:24.137 --> 21:26.137
But the farthest
anyone can dig back

21:26.139 --> 21:28.106
is to the manitoba rail
and transport.

21:28.108 --> 21:30.842
I mean, as far as the public
record are concerned,

21:30.844 --> 21:33.245
before that,
the man didn't even exist.

21:33.247 --> 21:35.080
- Yes, but he made
his early fortune

21:35.082 --> 21:36.648
on the American frontier.

21:36.650 --> 21:39.718
It's hardly a bastion
for crack recordkeeping.

21:44.124 --> 21:45.577
You're right.

21:48.028 --> 21:50.529
Perhaps the whole thing
just feels

21:50.531 --> 21:53.732
too good to be true.

21:53.734 --> 21:55.534
- Mr. Grayson
is leading the charge

21:55.536 --> 21:59.104
in a technical revolution
that will change everything.

21:59.106 --> 22:00.138
- I know.

22:00.140 --> 22:01.640
- I know you, Jonathan.

22:01.642 --> 22:05.010
How can you not want
to be a part of that?

22:05.012 --> 22:07.305
- Let me think.

22:09.650 --> 22:12.717
- I will kick you if you don't.

22:14.620 --> 22:17.689
- Then I suppose I'll have to.

22:27.133 --> 22:29.734
- Oh...

22:31.371 --> 22:33.805
- He's acquired every drop
of coolant

22:33.807 --> 22:35.307
from our distributors

22:35.309 --> 22:38.743
and put in an order
for 250,000 gallons,

22:38.745 --> 22:41.179
which, of course, we declined.

22:41.181 --> 22:44.316
Then this.

22:50.189 --> 22:52.123
- He's offered to buy you out.

22:52.125 --> 22:54.859
- For treble the book value
of my stock.

22:54.861 --> 22:55.994
I declined, of course.

22:55.996 --> 22:58.196
- I should hope so.

22:58.198 --> 23:00.298
As absurd as his claims are

23:00.300 --> 23:02.233
regarding this geomagnetism,

23:02.235 --> 23:04.836
we must obstruct him
at every turn.

23:04.838 --> 23:06.004
- A schoolboy experiment

23:06.006 --> 23:07.606
delivered with a bit of panache

23:07.608 --> 23:10.241
hardly equals large-scale
practical application.

23:10.243 --> 23:12.377
- Yes, but even if the mere idea
gets a foothold

23:12.379 --> 23:13.812
in the public imagination,

23:13.814 --> 23:17.182
it could impact severely
upon our portfolio.

23:17.184 --> 23:19.317
- Perhaps.
- But surely over the long...

23:19.319 --> 23:20.885
- therefore, any member
of this organization

23:20.887 --> 23:22.988
who knowingly assists Grayson

23:22.990 --> 23:26.057
will be dealt with
in the harshest of terms.

23:35.301 --> 23:37.836
- So...

23:37.838 --> 23:40.038
This trick with the light bulbs

23:40.040 --> 23:42.641
that you performed
with just such panache

23:42.643 --> 23:43.942
at your housewarming party...

23:43.944 --> 23:46.111
- I prefer to think of it
as a debutante ball.

23:46.113 --> 23:47.178
Ah.

23:47.180 --> 23:48.747
A cotillion, was it?

23:48.749 --> 23:49.881
- Yes, ma'am.

23:49.883 --> 23:52.017
And I was the belle of it.

23:52.019 --> 23:54.753
- And the main entertainment
as well.

23:54.755 --> 23:57.989
- If you're referring
to my little demonstration,

23:57.991 --> 23:59.057
yes.

23:59.059 --> 24:00.125
- How did you do it?

24:02.229 --> 24:03.228
- Really.

24:03.230 --> 24:04.963
No, I must know.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.765
I simply adore magic tricks.

24:06.767 --> 24:08.900
- I'm sorry to disappoint you.

24:08.902 --> 24:12.170
There was neither magic
nor trickery involved.

24:12.172 --> 24:14.706
Simply science, physics,
and technology.

24:14.708 --> 24:18.677
Although I have been known
to dabble in the occult.

24:18.679 --> 24:22.914
- Have you?
- Do tell.

24:22.916 --> 24:26.017
- Observe.

24:28.387 --> 24:31.489
- What are you doing?

24:43.135 --> 24:45.070
Where did it go?

24:48.975 --> 24:50.144
- No.

24:52.946 --> 24:55.380
- Shall we show the Butler?

24:55.382 --> 24:57.849
- Jenkins, that will be all.

24:57.851 --> 25:00.852
- Yes, ma'am.

26:11.877 --> 26:13.031
Miss Murray?

26:15.295 --> 26:16.718
- Good morning.

26:18.479 --> 26:21.399
May I offer you my carriage?

26:23.502 --> 26:25.103
- Mr. Renfield,

26:25.105 --> 26:26.604
is it considered proper
in America

26:26.606 --> 26:28.406
for a gentleman to ask
a single lady

26:28.408 --> 26:30.542
if she would like
to ride in his carriage?

26:30.544 --> 26:31.609
- To tell you the truth, ma'am,

26:31.611 --> 26:33.344
I don't believe my employer

26:33.346 --> 26:36.214
ever gave a damn
about what's proper.

26:38.951 --> 26:42.020
- Nor I.

26:45.591 --> 26:46.743
Thank you.

26:54.033 --> 26:56.034
- Certain you wouldn't
rather swim?

26:56.036 --> 26:58.636
I'd hate to compromise
your reputation.

26:58.638 --> 27:00.872
- Well, I'm afraid
only I can do that,

27:00.874 --> 27:03.942
Mr. Grayson.

27:22.229 --> 27:24.329
- So...

27:24.331 --> 27:27.398
Did you quit?

27:33.239 --> 27:35.006
- I'm beginning to harbor
second thoughts.

27:35.008 --> 27:38.676
- You are mad.
- No, I'm not mad.

27:38.678 --> 27:42.046
It's just, I keep wondering,
why me?

27:42.048 --> 27:44.949
There are hundreds,
thousands of men in London

27:44.951 --> 27:46.417
with greater qualifications,

27:46.419 --> 27:47.552
but Grayson chooses me.

27:47.554 --> 27:51.656
Don't you think
that's a bit odd?

27:51.658 --> 27:54.058
He must have
some sort of agenda.

27:54.060 --> 27:56.060
- What agenda?
- I don't know.

27:56.062 --> 27:57.495
That's just it.
I can't figure it out.

27:57.497 --> 27:59.230
Nothing adds up.

27:59.232 --> 28:02.100
- What will you tell Mina?

28:02.102 --> 28:03.501
- The truth.

28:03.503 --> 28:05.904
This whole...
this whole business,

28:05.906 --> 28:08.973
it just feels so wrong.

28:23.656 --> 28:26.658
- So did Mr. Harker tell you
about my offer?

28:26.660 --> 28:27.692
- He did.

28:27.694 --> 28:29.227
- And what do you think?

28:29.229 --> 28:32.163
- Well, I-I told him
that I would give him a kick

28:32.165 --> 28:33.298
if he didn't take you up on it.

28:33.300 --> 28:37.735
I bet you did.

28:37.737 --> 28:40.405
So what's your area of study,
miss Murray?

28:40.407 --> 28:42.173
- Um, I'm studying
to be a physician.

28:42.175 --> 28:45.310
- Are you?
- How extraordinary.

28:45.312 --> 28:46.311
- You don't approve.

28:46.313 --> 28:48.513
- Now, why would you say that?

28:48.515 --> 28:51.215
- My father is
the supervising physician

28:51.217 --> 28:52.417
at bethlem royal hospital,

28:52.419 --> 28:55.987
and people would always
say to me...

28:57.424 --> 29:00.124
"Are you going to be a nurse
when you grow up?"

29:00.126 --> 29:03.494
And I would say,
"no, I'm going to be a doctor."

29:03.496 --> 29:05.029
- Really?
- Yes.

29:05.031 --> 29:06.230
And that was all
very sweet and charming

29:06.232 --> 29:09.534
until I was 14 or so.

29:09.536 --> 29:10.846
- So what?

29:16.509 --> 29:18.872
Indeed, Mr. Grayson.

29:19.179 --> 29:23.314
- Two words guaranteed to repel
any manner of mediocrity

29:23.316 --> 29:27.385
masquerading
as conventional wisdom.

29:39.164 --> 29:42.400
I have a very difficult
examination today,

29:42.402 --> 29:46.337
one which I may well fail,

29:46.339 --> 29:47.438
and if I do...

29:47.440 --> 29:49.540
- that'll be the end
of your dreams?

29:49.542 --> 29:52.477
- Very much so.

29:52.479 --> 29:55.013
- If there's one thing
I've learned in all my years,

29:55.015 --> 29:56.514
in all my journeys,
miss Murray,

29:56.516 --> 29:59.584
is that when it comes
to dreams,

29:59.586 --> 30:01.652
one may falter,

30:01.654 --> 30:05.089
but the only way to fail
is to abandon them.

30:07.693 --> 30:10.762
Here.

30:29.815 --> 30:32.216
When it comes to dreams,

30:32.218 --> 30:33.418
one might falter,

30:33.420 --> 30:36.254
but the only way to fail
is to abandon them.

31:01.814 --> 31:05.116
The patient exhibits
left ventricular wall thickening

31:05.118 --> 31:07.718
and mal-alignment
of the muscle cells,

31:07.720 --> 31:10.221
or myocardial disarray.

31:10.223 --> 31:12.623
The hypertrophic thickening
is asymmetric

31:12.625 --> 31:15.593
and clearly involves
the inter-ventricular septum,

31:15.595 --> 31:18.229
which obstructs
the cardiac outflow

31:18.231 --> 31:19.730
and prevents the blood
from flowing freely

31:19.732 --> 31:22.800
between the aortic valve
and into the aorta.

32:29.735 --> 32:32.236
- The seers located the vampire
in stepney.

32:32.238 --> 32:33.938
He detected them.

32:33.940 --> 32:35.206
- He what?

32:35.208 --> 32:36.841
- He detected them
and then employed

32:36.843 --> 32:39.177
some kind of countermeasure.

32:39.179 --> 32:40.311
- Is that even possible?

32:40.313 --> 32:41.479
- Well, it's rare, yes.

32:41.481 --> 32:42.713
It's extraordinarily so,

32:42.715 --> 32:45.383
but it is possible
if he is very, very old.

32:45.385 --> 32:48.452
Two or three centuries
at the least.

32:50.455 --> 32:52.390
- Have you consulted
your peers?

32:52.392 --> 32:54.725
Has anyone ever come across
anything like this?

32:54.727 --> 32:56.260
- Not in our lifetime, no.

32:56.262 --> 32:57.428
There was Lucrezia Borgia...

32:57.430 --> 32:59.931
- Yes, yes.
Spare me the history lesson.

32:59.933 --> 33:03.000
All I need to know is,
can we contain this?

33:03.002 --> 33:04.802
- I promise.

33:04.804 --> 33:07.672
I will track him,
and I will destroy him,

33:07.674 --> 33:11.209
with or without
the seers' assistance.

33:22.854 --> 33:25.623
- You just raised the rent
a month ago.

33:25.625 --> 33:28.693
- If you don't bloody like it,
move out.

33:31.597 --> 33:33.264
- There you are, Harker.

33:33.266 --> 33:35.233
We've been looking for you.

33:35.235 --> 33:36.567
- I passed.

33:36.569 --> 33:38.836
- Not only passed,
but first in her class.

33:40.974 --> 33:42.240
It was stupendous.

33:42.242 --> 33:43.741
Professor Van Helsing
says that I...

33:43.743 --> 33:46.496
- she's the first female student
to come top of her class in college.

33:46.746 --> 33:47.778
I reserved a table.

33:47.780 --> 33:48.988
- At the Savoy!

33:49.049 --> 33:51.049
- August is going to make
something special just for Mina.

33:51.351 --> 33:52.883
Isn't that divine?

33:52.885 --> 33:53.985
- August?
- August who?

33:53.987 --> 33:57.288
- Oh, August Escoffier, silly.

33:57.290 --> 33:58.489
Don't you know anything?

33:58.491 --> 34:00.458
Doesn't he know anything?

34:00.460 --> 34:01.926
- Come, we've got a cab waiting.

34:01.928 --> 34:05.329
- Wait. I can't.

34:05.331 --> 34:06.897
I'm under the cosh
with a deadline,

34:06.899 --> 34:09.500
and I have to deliver the copy
before they set the presses.

34:09.502 --> 34:10.701
- Oh, don't worry, Harker.

34:10.703 --> 34:13.771
The whole celebration's
my treat!

34:16.275 --> 34:17.808
- I can't tell you
how happy we are

34:17.810 --> 34:19.310
to have you on board.

34:19.312 --> 34:20.978
You will call me Alexander,

34:20.980 --> 34:22.413
and I will call you Harker.

34:22.415 --> 34:23.813
- Of course, if it pleases you.

34:23.815 --> 34:25.016
- There's something
you should know about me

34:25.018 --> 34:27.318
right now, Harker.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.353
I never do anything,

34:29.355 --> 34:32.889
<i>anything</i>
<i>that does not please me.</i>

34:32.891 --> 34:33.958
Is that not true, Renfield?

34:33.960 --> 34:35.893
- All too true,
I'm afraid, sir.

34:36.692 --> 34:38.025
Please.

34:38.731 --> 34:40.331
He insists on calling me "sir"

34:40.333 --> 34:43.333
because he knows
how much it annoys me,

34:43.335 --> 34:44.902
but I will brook
no such insubordination

34:44.904 --> 34:48.105
from the likes of you.

34:48.107 --> 34:50.775
Now, to business.

34:50.777 --> 34:53.844
I want you to tell me everything
you know about lord Laurent.

34:53.846 --> 34:55.589
- Lord Laurent.
- Uh...

34:57.617 --> 34:59.050
Well, he...
he dabbles in business.

34:59.052 --> 35:00.651
He sits in parliament.

35:00.653 --> 35:01.819
- We know all that,

35:01.821 --> 35:03.921
but every man has a dark side.

35:03.923 --> 35:06.324
I need to know his.

35:06.326 --> 35:09.126
I want you to tell me
everything.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.767
- Everything you need to know,
you can find out

35:16.769 --> 35:19.970
at 10:00 P.M.
at the swinburne club.

35:22.441 --> 35:22.941
- Good.

35:26.879 --> 35:28.136
Very good.

35:47.133 --> 35:48.599
- Members only.

35:57.410 --> 36:00.111

and you know how cross he gets
if I come in late

36:33.713 --> 36:35.446
the night before a match.

36:35.448 --> 36:38.516
- Only so cross as I get
when you leave so early.

36:38.518 --> 36:41.585

37:05.511 --> 37:07.144
This is a private establishment.
You can't...

37:07.146 --> 37:09.480
- Stephen, what is this?

37:09.482 --> 37:10.787
Who is this man?

37:11.794 --> 37:13.570
- I'm Alexander Grayson.

37:14.020 --> 37:15.820
- The American.
- Mm-hmm.

37:15.822 --> 37:17.154
And you would be Daniel,

37:17.156 --> 37:19.946
lord Davenport's only son.

37:20.793 --> 37:22.526
Hello, Daniel.

37:22.528 --> 37:24.862
- Leave him alone.

37:24.864 --> 37:27.832
- Stephen, please.

37:27.834 --> 37:29.266
Sit.

37:39.579 --> 37:41.979
Personally, I couldn't care
who a man chooses to love.

37:41.981 --> 37:44.081
It's really
none of my business.

37:44.083 --> 37:48.586
However, there are legions
of less broad-minded souls.

37:48.588 --> 37:50.187
Your wife,

37:50.189 --> 37:51.255
his father,

37:51.257 --> 37:53.057
who would take
considerable umbrage

37:53.059 --> 37:56.293
if your inclinations were given
a public airing.

37:58.763 --> 38:01.765
Why, thank you.

38:01.767 --> 38:05.536
What, I wonder, would that do
to your reputations?

38:05.538 --> 38:08.772
Indeed, your families's
reputations?

38:14.679 --> 38:15.946
- What do you want?

38:22.654 --> 38:25.055
- Bravo!

38:30.863 --> 38:32.329
- Very nice.
- Magnificent.

38:32.331 --> 38:34.231
- I mean to ask for her hand
this very night.

38:34.233 --> 38:36.901
- What?
- In front of everyone.

38:36.903 --> 38:39.169
- Of course,
in front of everyone.

38:39.171 --> 38:41.705
In front of God, the prophets,
the angels,

38:41.707 --> 38:43.274
and every bloody soul
in this room!

38:43.276 --> 38:44.775
- Yeah!

38:44.777 --> 38:46.010
- Even you, you miserable git.

38:46.012 --> 38:48.178
- Hey.

38:48.180 --> 38:50.848
- My boy is going to be
a proper English gentleman!

38:50.850 --> 38:52.316
- That's right.

38:52.318 --> 38:54.151
That's right,
with a proper English wife!

38:54.153 --> 38:56.654
Cheers!

38:56.656 --> 38:58.289
- Hold on, hold on.

38:58.291 --> 39:00.057
Miss Murray intends to be
a physician.

39:00.059 --> 39:02.225
How does that square with
the "proper English wife" bit?

39:05.831 --> 39:08.866
- Mate, when I slip this ring

39:08.868 --> 39:10.601
on Mina's lovely little finger,

39:10.603 --> 39:13.637
I have every confidence
that she'll forget

39:13.639 --> 39:16.240
all this silliness
at university

39:16.242 --> 39:18.342
and settle down
and dedicate herself

39:18.344 --> 39:21.579
to more natural,
womanly pursuits.

39:28.584 --> 39:29.963
Mina...
Mina, wait! Mina!

39:31.590 --> 39:34.194
Mina. Mina, wait!
Mina, Mina.

39:34.286 --> 39:35.385
Look, I'm sorry...

39:36.305 --> 39:37.957
I'm sorry.

39:38.598 --> 39:40.612
- Why apologize?

39:40.933 --> 39:42.066
It's how you feel.

39:42.068 --> 39:44.268
It is how you have always felt.

39:44.270 --> 39:46.236
- That's not fair!

39:46.238 --> 39:48.871
I've never said a word
of discouragement to you, ever.

39:51.744 --> 39:55.813
Nor a single word of support.

40:01.186 --> 40:04.254
- Please. Mina...

40:36.021 --> 40:37.821
- Good night.

40:51.870 --> 40:53.627
- I must know your name.

40:54.473 --> 40:56.035
Please.

40:56.308 --> 40:58.375
If you don't give me your name,

40:58.377 --> 41:00.844
I won't give you your stub.

41:00.846 --> 41:02.146
- Then I shan't give you
your coat.

41:02.148 --> 41:05.049
- Ah, but I can always
purchase another coat.

41:05.051 --> 41:06.750
But your name?

41:06.752 --> 41:07.885
Now, that's something
I treasure

41:07.887 --> 41:11.021
more than any mere garment.

41:11.023 --> 41:14.992
- Sinead.
- Ah, Sinead.

41:15.130 --> 41:16.349
Lovely.
