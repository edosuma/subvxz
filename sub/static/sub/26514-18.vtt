00:01.175 --> 00:02.741
Previously onDynasty...

00:06.963 --> 00:09.357
What the hell is that?It's my family crest.
It's a warning.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.489
You look wonderful, Mother.
One of a kind.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.317
I'll keep your secret
if you keep mine.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.972
You hijacked my book event
to publicize another author?

00:16.015 --> 00:18.018
Liam's book is about me.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.497
I'm proud to have my son
working alongside me

00:19.541 --> 00:20.542
in the family business.

00:20.585 --> 00:21.760
The days of my
silent partnership

00:21.804 --> 00:23.240
in this club are over.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.981
It sounds like somebody
should do something about that.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.461
I told the painters
they could get started

00:26.504 --> 00:28.028
on my new office in an hour.

00:28.071 --> 00:30.117
You can't turn your back
for a second around here.

00:38.342 --> 00:41.302
GEORGE:
I can't believe that
breakfast is this extravagant

00:41.345 --> 00:43.217
every morning.I still can't believe

00:43.260 --> 00:44.566
that you're here
every morning.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.524
You know we're thrilled
to have you here, son.

00:46.568 --> 00:50.093
I've always said family is the
most important currency in life.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.660
No, you've always
said that money

00:51.703 --> 00:53.836
is the most
important currency.[clears throat]

00:53.879 --> 00:56.230
Speaking of family,

00:56.273 --> 00:59.189
Steven and my divorce
is finally official.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.103
I'm so sorry, Sam.

01:00.147 --> 01:02.584
It's a new chapter.

01:02.627 --> 01:04.063
My reinvention.

01:04.107 --> 01:07.806
But, um, I couldn't have
survived this without you guys.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.504
Well, maybe without you.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.114
So,

01:11.158 --> 01:14.074
to say thank you
and to, uh, debut the new me,

01:14.117 --> 01:16.293
I thought I could
throw a party here.

01:16.337 --> 01:18.208
If that's okay with you guys.

01:18.252 --> 01:19.992
Sure. Um, just one question.

01:20.036 --> 01:22.386
Who's the new you,
and does he work for a living?

01:22.430 --> 01:24.127
That's two questions, Daddy.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.129
Sam, is there any way

01:26.173 --> 01:28.349
that you can thank me
by not inviting me?

01:28.392 --> 01:29.785
Only because I'm very busy,

01:29.828 --> 01:31.526
and this way we can
skip the awkwardness

01:31.569 --> 01:33.745
of me walking in on you
and some rando again.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.095
You're coming.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.183
Wouldn't miss it. Theme?I was thinking

01:36.226 --> 01:37.793
something sexy,

01:37.836 --> 01:40.839
like animal print
or under the sea.

01:40.883 --> 01:43.973
Do you think we can turn the
living room into an aquarium?

01:44.016 --> 01:46.758
Right, because nothing
says sexy like fish.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.151
What about a masquerade party?

01:48.195 --> 01:49.500
Cliché.

01:49.544 --> 01:50.762
No.

01:50.806 --> 01:51.894
To honor

01:51.937 --> 01:53.722
your reinvention

01:53.765 --> 01:56.290
and reveal your new identity.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.292
I love that.Wait. Does this mean

01:58.335 --> 02:00.294
that we'll have to wear
masks? That touch our skin?

02:00.337 --> 02:02.426
It's also a security nightmare.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.994
That's true. Yeah.
I hadn't thought about that.

02:05.037 --> 02:07.214
And you're right, Fallon.

02:07.257 --> 02:08.519
It is a bit cliché.
I mean,

02:08.562 --> 02:09.868
I haven't been to one before,

02:09.912 --> 02:12.393
uh, but I didn't grow up
in this house.

02:12.436 --> 02:13.611
SAM:
We're doing it.

02:13.655 --> 02:15.004
Saturday night.

02:15.047 --> 02:16.484
You know, it's just a shame

02:16.527 --> 02:19.095
that Mom won't be released
from the hospital in time.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.184
Oh, and before you ask, no,
she isn't seeing visitors yet.

02:21.228 --> 02:22.794
No one's asking.

02:24.579 --> 02:26.276
[sighs]

02:26.320 --> 02:28.496
You were up early this morning.

02:28.539 --> 02:30.759
I hope I didn't wake you.
I got a call.

02:30.802 --> 02:33.022
David Etz was injured
in a car accident.

02:33.065 --> 02:35.155
The goalie? Is he okay?

02:35.198 --> 02:37.157
We'll know more after his MRI.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.159
I'm more concerned
about how it happened.

02:39.202 --> 02:40.421
Now, I don't have
all the details,

02:40.464 --> 02:42.162
but something
doesn't add up.

02:42.205 --> 02:43.424
The roads were clear.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.208
His toxicology test's
come back negative.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.645
Well, maybe he can't control
that sports car he bought.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.212
I don't think it was his fault.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.214
You think someone
caused the accident on purpose?

02:51.258 --> 02:52.476
Not just someone.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.043
Your family.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.349
Ai yai yai.I don't have any proof,

02:55.392 --> 02:57.916
but first
Freddie's drugged.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.484
Then my beverage license
at the stadium is delayed

03:00.528 --> 03:02.182
a week before opening day.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.053
I find it hard to believe
that's a coincidence,

03:04.096 --> 03:06.186
especially after you told me
your father was out to get us.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.318
And then let's not forget

03:08.362 --> 03:10.407
my new Koons
outdoor sculpture,

03:10.451 --> 03:12.235
bulldozed in the backyard.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.019
And the neighbors apologized.

03:14.063 --> 03:16.152
I'm right about
this. You know it. Mi amor,

03:16.196 --> 03:19.416
sometimes an accident
is just an accident.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.244
Atlanta drivers are the worst.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.637
Everyone knows it.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.683
Besides, what else are you
going to do for security?

03:25.727 --> 03:28.556
The only thing you forgot
is snipers on the roof.

03:28.599 --> 03:31.428
Well, I can make a call.

03:34.388 --> 03:36.694
I really still can't believe it.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.394
I look just like... [gasps]

03:40.437 --> 03:41.830
[sighs]

03:41.873 --> 03:45.137
I look just like I did
five years ago.

03:45.181 --> 03:48.271
I'm sure you do.
You look amazing.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.708
The surgeon did
an excellent job.Does this mean

03:50.752 --> 03:54.277
I can finally get out of here
and show the world the new me?

03:54.321 --> 03:55.713
Patience, Mother.
Even though you look amazing,

03:55.757 --> 03:57.672
the doctor suggests
you stay here a few extra days

03:57.715 --> 04:00.501
just so you can completely heal.Oh, but I am healed.

04:00.544 --> 04:03.199
I mean, between you and me,

04:03.243 --> 04:05.288
this isn't the first time
I've had work done.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.811
I said just a few more days.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.248
I just thought because I...No.

04:09.336 --> 04:12.600
Besides, I have come up
with the perfect way

04:12.643 --> 04:14.602
to reintroduce you to the world.

04:14.645 --> 04:17.344
What are your feelings
about masquerade parties?

04:20.129 --> 04:21.652
Whatever this
Player Development Fund is,

04:21.696 --> 04:23.915
it's getting $10 million
in team money.

04:23.959 --> 04:26.614
And it doesn't seem to be
developing much of anything.

04:26.657 --> 04:27.963
You think Blake Carrington's
laundering money

04:28.006 --> 04:29.312
through the Atlantix
organization?

04:29.356 --> 04:31.314
I think that's just the tip
of the iceberg.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.837
And I don't think
it's his money.

04:32.881 --> 04:34.622
Why would he be doing
someone else's laundry?

04:34.665 --> 04:36.232
The Atlantix
recently closed a deal

04:36.276 --> 04:37.451
on land for their new stadium.

04:37.494 --> 04:38.800
Land that I owned

04:38.843 --> 04:41.106
and would have never sold
to Blake Carrington.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.326
That's why he used
a shell company

04:43.370 --> 04:44.632
owned by Silvio Flores.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.460
TheFlores in Mexico

04:46.503 --> 04:48.940
who owns the club
Azteca soccer team?That's the one.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.420
He helps Blake get that land.

04:50.464 --> 04:52.335
Blake helps him clean
his dirty money.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.381
I lose my community center.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.383
It sounds like you're just upset
about this stadium deal.

04:56.426 --> 04:57.471
Man, you think
I would make all this up

04:57.514 --> 04:59.211
just 'cause Blake hurt
my feelings?

04:59.255 --> 05:00.604
Do you need me to list

05:00.648 --> 05:02.606
all the illegal things
he's done over the years?

05:02.650 --> 05:04.216
All I'm saying
is that there's nothing here

05:04.260 --> 05:06.001
that connects Silvio Flores.

05:06.044 --> 05:08.830
Man, except the fact that
Blake's engaged to his daughter.Right.

05:08.873 --> 05:12.094
But Cristal has been estranged
from her family for years.

05:12.137 --> 05:13.922
We've been trying to
nail Blake Carrington

05:13.965 --> 05:15.576
for a long time.

05:15.619 --> 05:18.318
In order to build a case,
we need a whole paper trail.

05:18.361 --> 05:20.972
Well, I might be able to help
with that.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.452
I assume you've seen this.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.236
If it's a tasteful modeling
photo of you in a mask,

05:24.280 --> 05:25.977
I have not.It's not.

05:26.021 --> 05:28.197
Though that's not a bad idea.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.025
Anyway, I was looking to find

05:30.068 --> 05:32.462
some single, famous and fabulous
people to invite to the party

05:32.506 --> 05:36.074
when, uh,
this article popped up.

05:36.118 --> 05:38.773
"Liam Ridley, heir
to Van Kirk fortune,

05:38.816 --> 05:42.646
writes book about romance with
It girl Ashley Cunningham"?

05:42.690 --> 05:44.169
Wait, people think
this character

05:44.213 --> 05:45.388
is supposed to be Ashley?Yeah.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.608
All the gossip magazines do.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.218
But why do people
care about Ashley?

05:49.261 --> 05:50.915
Because apparently
she's like the Meghan Markle

05:50.959 --> 05:53.701
of the Upper East Side,
something I wish I'd known

05:53.744 --> 05:55.877
before I shaved off
her eyebrows.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.662
It's two powerful New York
families coming together.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.969
Their social media hashtag
is #SuperCouple.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.493
Well, first of all,
they are not a couple anymore.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.495
And second of all,
the character is me, okay?

06:05.539 --> 06:07.541
I mean, her name is Farrah,

06:07.584 --> 06:09.412
which is basically Fallon
without the Ls.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.979
I think I would know.
I'm the publisher.

06:11.022 --> 06:13.590
So, are you upset as a publisher
or as the fake ex-wife?

06:13.634 --> 06:15.505
I'm not upset,
okay? Not at all.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.507
It's better that people
don't find out, honestly,

06:17.551 --> 06:20.118
because it would be
a giant conflict of interest.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.338
So this is all business?
You have no feelings for Liam?

06:22.382 --> 06:23.905
Honestly,
I don't know what I feel,

06:23.948 --> 06:26.821
and I'm not sure
Liam does, either.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.693
But I do know that the book
had a slight increase

06:29.737 --> 06:31.129
in presales this week.

06:31.173 --> 06:33.436
I mean, I thought it was
just a computer glitch,

06:33.480 --> 06:34.742
but I bet it's
all this Ashley gossip.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.396
Oh, it definitely is.

06:37.919 --> 06:40.661
I'm just saying
a few public appearances

06:40.704 --> 06:43.011
to keep the book in the news
until the official release.

06:43.054 --> 06:45.405
I understand what
you're suggesting,

06:45.448 --> 06:48.146
but I'm gonna have to decline.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.409
Okay, look, for some reason,

06:49.452 --> 06:51.411
people are interested
in you and Ashley

06:51.454 --> 06:52.890
as though
you're New York royalty.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.675
And we haven't seen this kind
of momentum in presales

06:54.718 --> 06:56.024
since the book was announced.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.156
So the fact that
it's not the truth,

06:58.200 --> 07:00.420
that the character's not about
Ashley, that doesn't bother you?

07:00.463 --> 07:01.769
The only thing that bothers me

07:01.812 --> 07:03.553
is that your presales...Yeah, they're terrible.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.425
I get it. I just...
I think it's weird

07:05.468 --> 07:07.122
you want me to parade around
with my ex-girlfriend.

07:07.165 --> 07:09.037
Well, you couldn't parade around
with me even if you wanted to.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.473
Not that I'm saying you want to.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.475
It's just, I mean,
what would people say?

07:12.519 --> 07:14.521
Your publisher putting out
a book about herself

07:14.564 --> 07:16.566
written by her ex?
Not great optics.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.569
I just thought we were
on the same page.

07:21.615 --> 07:25.357
I'm just focusing
on what's best for you.

07:27.403 --> 07:29.492
Also, how would you even get
Ashley to agree to this?

07:29.536 --> 07:30.667
Ask her yourself.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.364
Come on in!

07:34.410 --> 07:37.674
[chuckles] Hi, Liam.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.284
So, what,
you two are friends now?

07:39.328 --> 07:41.461
Mm, wouldn't say friends.

07:41.504 --> 07:42.592
FALLON:
No.

07:42.636 --> 07:43.680
But we did bury the hatchet.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.943
And I'm all
about female empowerment,

07:45.987 --> 07:47.728
and, uh, two girls
fighting over the same guy,

07:47.771 --> 07:49.599
it's so
My Best Friend's Wedding.

07:49.643 --> 07:50.948
And what are you getting
out of this?

07:50.992 --> 07:53.037
Nothing. I'm doing it for you.

07:53.081 --> 07:55.170
I feel bad about
how I ended things.

07:55.213 --> 07:57.607
So when Fallon said this would
really help with book sales,

07:57.651 --> 07:58.782
I figured it was a sign.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.915
And it is nice to see you again.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.659
[chuckles]

08:05.702 --> 08:07.138
Aw.

08:07.182 --> 08:09.619
Going in for a hug. That's nice.

08:10.664 --> 08:12.492
Hey, so,

08:12.535 --> 08:15.495
I set up your first interview.
You guys let me know

08:15.538 --> 08:17.497
if you need
any talking points...ASHLEY: I think we'll be okay.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.194
We've handled the press before

08:19.237 --> 08:21.283
when we cochaired a
gala for the Bronx Zoo.

19:40.701 --> 19:43.007
Well, I know
you guys go way back, and I...

19:43.051 --> 19:46.185
I admire a friendship
that's stood the test of time.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.274
But I can imagine
that this whole

19:48.317 --> 19:51.102
Carrington-Colby feud
must have been...

19:51.146 --> 19:52.756
you know, complicated for you.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.716
[chuckles] Honestly,
I try to stay out of it.

19:55.759 --> 19:58.762
I mean, Blake may have made
some mistakes with the Colbys,

19:58.806 --> 20:01.678
but he also gave me
the opportunity of a lifetime.

20:01.722 --> 20:03.332
Well said.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.769
Didn't you come down here
for some wine?

20:05.813 --> 20:07.945
Changed my mind.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.167
FALLON:
You're creating a spectacle.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.779
I mean, there is such a thing
as too much publicity.

20:15.823 --> 20:19.305
I don't know. I thought your
date last night was a bit much.

20:19.348 --> 20:20.828
Isn't this what you asked for?

20:20.871 --> 20:22.830
Me and Ashley out in the world.

20:22.873 --> 20:25.006
To a point. I just-- I don't
want the public to get sick

20:25.049 --> 20:27.313
of the perfect couple
that breaks up

20:27.356 --> 20:29.140
and then still manages
to be a perfect couple.

20:29.184 --> 20:30.403
Okay, well,
until that happens,

20:30.446 --> 20:33.101
why do you care
if we have dinner together?

20:33.144 --> 20:35.190
I...

20:35.234 --> 20:37.192
Because I am your publisher,

20:37.236 --> 20:39.020
and it is my job to care.

20:39.063 --> 20:41.936
Besides, I heard her
say something like

20:41.979 --> 20:43.111
she made a mistake.
So, what,

20:43.154 --> 20:44.112
are you guys gonna give it
another go?

20:44.155 --> 20:45.548
Not that I care.I don't know.

20:45.592 --> 20:46.897
Okay, what's best
for book sales?

20:46.941 --> 20:48.334
Again, this
was your idea.

20:48.377 --> 20:50.640
So if you think
you made a mistake...I didn't think

20:50.684 --> 20:52.207
you would be so happy
to run with it.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.948
I mean,
considering the character

20:53.991 --> 20:56.646
isn't even based on Ashley.
Right?

20:56.690 --> 20:59.997
So maybe the ending's
just not what I thought it was.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.260
I'm sorry,
but I told my story

21:01.303 --> 21:04.219
the way that I needed
to tell it, Fallon.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.743
I-In a way
that allowed me to move on.

21:06.787 --> 21:07.831
Liam...

21:07.875 --> 21:09.877
why did you want me
to read this book?

21:09.920 --> 21:11.661
I don't know.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.097
[sighs]

21:13.141 --> 21:16.013

a different reaction.

21:25.719 --> 21:29.244

at the masquerade party.

JENNINGS:
I...

21:40.473 --> 21:41.952
talked to my
brother last night.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.563
That's nice.
How's he doing?

21:43.606 --> 21:45.086
Not good.Hmm.

21:45.129 --> 21:47.915
There was a power failure at
the Azteca game last night.

21:47.958 --> 21:50.004
Aw, that's a shame, but
I'm sure they will bounce back.

21:50.047 --> 21:51.875
I have to ask--

21:51.919 --> 21:53.834
did you have anything
to do with it?

21:53.877 --> 21:56.837
And please be
honest with me.

21:56.880 --> 22:00.623
I did what I needed
to do to show that I
won't be trifled with.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.364
So you caused a blackout?

22:02.408 --> 22:03.974
What were you thinking?

22:04.018 --> 22:05.889
I was thinking that I needed
to protect my interests.

22:05.933 --> 22:09.240
Okay, I need to tell you
something, and you're
not gonna be happy.

22:09.284 --> 22:11.895
My family didn't
drug Freddie. I did.

22:11.939 --> 22:14.768
What? Why?Because I was worried

22:14.811 --> 22:16.291
about the safety
of everyone here.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.772
And framing my family
seemed like the only way

22:18.815 --> 22:20.556
to make you realize
the danger.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.036
But I went too far.

22:22.079 --> 22:24.778
Someone could
have been hurt.

22:24.821 --> 22:27.563
We're supposed to be a team,
and you manipulated me.

22:27.607 --> 22:29.304
We'regonna get hurt.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.437
Your father
is going to strike back

22:31.480 --> 22:34.309
after what happened last night,
you can count on that.

22:35.832 --> 22:38.269

through one pallet

enough for a headline.

24:24.854 --> 24:27.204

where this e-mail was sent.

39:27.930 --> 39:30.585
To this server in Mexico.

39:30.629 --> 39:32.587
What are the odds
this has something

39:32.631 --> 39:34.328
to do with Silvio Flores?

39:34.372 --> 39:35.851
If it does,
it's something illegal.

39:35.895 --> 39:38.637
Cristal told me that he fixes
games all over the world.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.726
We just need to figure
out what this list is.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.336
I can guarantee you,

39:42.380 --> 39:44.686
it'll lead us to something good.

39:46.688 --> 39:47.602
Yo, you hearing me?

39:48.647 --> 39:50.605
Uh, yeah.

39:50.649 --> 39:52.346
Yeah, sorry. I'm-I'm just...

39:52.390 --> 39:53.608
I'm really, really tired.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.394
But at least we have something

39:56.437 --> 39:57.656
to work with now, right?

40:02.182 --> 40:05.359
♪ Are you hearing about me?

40:05.403 --> 40:07.709

40:11.800 --> 40:13.498

I mean, I guess people only see
what they want to see.

40:17.197 --> 40:18.459
You can say
that again.

40:18.503 --> 40:20.461
I'm being serious, dear.

40:20.505 --> 40:22.811
I know that it's different,

40:22.855 --> 40:26.641
but, I mean, I think I look
just like I did five years ago.

40:26.685 --> 40:29.427
No, you look just like
Idid five years ago.

40:29.470 --> 40:32.604
Well, now you're just being mean
to your mother, as usual.

40:32.647 --> 40:34.475
Look, my initial
reaction

40:34.519 --> 40:37.870
to your face was not
my finest moment, true.

40:37.913 --> 40:40.960
But you have to understand
that this is a bit of a shock.

40:41.003 --> 40:43.832
Well, Fallon, I would never want
to make you uncomfortable.

40:43.876 --> 40:45.834
I'd rather die than hurt you,

40:45.878 --> 40:48.576
but... I'm sure
you'll get used to it.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.925
Get used to it?

40:49.969 --> 40:52.058
You're not doing anything
about this?

40:52.101 --> 40:54.626
You think life is a masquerade
party? Well, it's not.

40:54.669 --> 40:56.192
I know, but this is my face.

40:56.236 --> 40:59.631
I can't just take it off
like it's some mask.

40:59.674 --> 41:02.111
[clears throat]

41:02.155 --> 41:05.419
And I would appreciate it
if you, of all people, would

41:05.463 --> 41:07.639
try to embrace it.

41:07.682 --> 41:09.597
