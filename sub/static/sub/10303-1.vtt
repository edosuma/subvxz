01:22.440 --> 01:25.716
Hi. I'm Billy Ray Wetnapp
for Pest Boys Extermination.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.750
And I'm Kelly, your friendly
neighbourhood Verminator.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.228
And if you're lik e me...

01:32.480 --> 01:36.951
...there's nothing you love more
than a good old-fashion cook out.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.634
But if there's one thing
that fries my frankfurter...

01:39.880 --> 01:43.839
...it's sharing my buns
with a bunch of pesky insects.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.310
Well, if bugs are making you sizzle...

01:46.560 --> 01:49.677
...just pick up a can
of our newest insect repellent...

01:49.920 --> 01:52.753
...Pure-T-Poison.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.753
And to demonstrate
just how effective it is...

01:56.000 --> 01:58.673
...we've sprayed the Verminator's
left arm with it...

01:58.920 --> 02:02.390
...and if she wants her paycheque,
she'll have to stick that left arm...

02:02.640 --> 02:07.031
...into this cage of ravenous
Samoan dragon beetles and tak e it.

02:07.280 --> 02:09.235
- Left?
- Right.

02:09.479 --> 02:10.993
Got you.

02:17.640 --> 02:22.509
Boy, I tell you, I'd rather
have my ass caned in Singapore...

02:22.800 --> 02:25.268
...than get bit by one of them.

02:26.120 --> 02:29.078
Somebody shoot me!
Shoot me, please!

02:30.560 --> 02:33.233
It's Manny, me and Ma
here at Pest Boys, where our motto is:

02:33.440 --> 02:35.954
"The only good bugs
is named Bunny."

02:36.200 --> 02:39.351
Although, we'd kill him too
if you paid us.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.792
"Left? Right. Got you"?

02:52.800 --> 02:56.190
You know, if you were any dumber,
my IQ would go down.

02:57.640 --> 03:02.395
Bud, spare me your icky boy opinions
and let's get back to the side effects.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.595
Look, all it says...

03:03.800 --> 03:07.156
...is that Samoans use these beetles
to make a kind of truth serum.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.753
Truth serum?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.673
Yeah, you know,
it makes it impossible for you to lie.

03:11.880 --> 03:16.112
For instance, if someone was to ask
you, "How much is two plus two?"

03:16.360 --> 03:18.590
Now, you would have to be honest
and answer:

03:24.120 --> 03:25.075
Oh, yeah?

03:25.280 --> 03:27.635
Well, I may insult you back,
but deep down inside...

03:27.840 --> 03:31.150
...I envy your intelligence
and hope you can't see through me.

03:35.640 --> 03:39.189
Well, this could certainly be fun.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.519
What am I gonna do?

03:42.760 --> 03:45.718
- Hello?
- Hi, Bud.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.918
Hi, Mom. How's everything
in Wanker County?

03:49.160 --> 03:51.913
Oh, fine.
Grandma's doing much better.

03:52.160 --> 03:55.789
It was just a mild heart attack,
but it took us all by surprise.

03:56.040 --> 03:57.268
Oh, please.

03:57.520 --> 04:00.717
Jupiter's got moons that weigh less
than she does.

04:03.920 --> 04:07.390
By the way, Mom, Kelly's been
real anxious to talk to you.

04:07.640 --> 04:08.868
Yeah. Hold on a second.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.793
- No, I don't wanna... I don't wanna talk...
- Take the phone!

04:12.040 --> 04:14.395
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.

04:14.640 --> 04:17.279
- How is everyone?
- All right, I guess.

04:17.519 --> 04:22.514
Dad's at the shoe store
and Bud is holding his own.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.398
- And how are you?
- Well, fine.

04:29.640 --> 04:33.315
Especially considering
what a horrible role model you were.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.235
But then again...

04:35.440 --> 04:38.876
...you were too busy watching TV
and dyeing your hair, so...

04:39.760 --> 04:42.320
I'll see you in a few weeks, Mom.
Yeah.

04:42.920 --> 04:46.708
Oh, my God. Those stupid beetles have
me telling the truth to my own mother.

04:46.960 --> 04:49.269
That is a squaw
that stroked the camel's sack.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.035
Why can't I have a job I love
like everybody else?

05:03.240 --> 05:06.277
Oh, God, I hate my job.

05:16.880 --> 05:20.793
- Hey, Al?
- I'm back here, Jefferson!

05:21.360 --> 05:24.909
Oh, hey, Al. What are you doing?

05:31.320 --> 05:33.914
I'm doing some inventory.
What's going on with you?

05:34.160 --> 05:38.995
Oh, Marcie's in another one
of her foul moods. PMS.

05:40.360 --> 05:44.069
- You know, post-MasterCard syndrome.
- Yeah, I know.

05:44.280 --> 05:47.033
I mean, she can charge anything
any time she wants...

05:47.280 --> 05:52.035
...but let me buy one stinking
ivory-inlaid pool table...

05:53.320 --> 05:55.276
Oh, well. You wanna come over...

05:55.520 --> 05:59.513
...see what the limit on a Platinum card
looks like before they haul it away?

05:59.760 --> 06:03.435
No, to tell you the truth, I'm looking
forward to a great night of sex.

06:04.200 --> 06:08.352
- I thought Peggy was out of town.
- She is, that's what makes it so good.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.997
Good one.

06:14.280 --> 06:17.272
Do me a favour, hand me that box
of sandals over there, would you?

06:17.480 --> 06:18.833
Oh, sure.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.918
Hey, you know, maybe Marcie
could use a pair of sandals...

06:22.120 --> 06:23.997
Hey!

06:25.560 --> 06:29.712
- Jefferson, are you okay?
- I think I got whiplash.

06:29.960 --> 06:32.235
I don't have no insurance.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.549
Well, then I don't have whiplash.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.470
Now, wait a second, Al...

06:40.400 --> 06:43.039
Wait a second. There's a bunch
of boxes back here, Al.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.196
- Give me a hand.
- Move them over here.

06:45.400 --> 06:48.995
- Check this out.
- Man. What the hell?

06:51.440 --> 06:55.638
Hey, Jefferson,
maybe this is Al Capone's treasure.

06:56.840 --> 07:00.674
Why would Al Capone hide his treasure
in the wall of a women's shoe store?

07:00.920 --> 07:03.150
Maybe he was dating
J. Edgar Hoover.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.237
Come on, let's get this stuff outside.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.435
It's pretty heavy.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.513
Oh, please let it be money.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.512
It's gotta be money.
I know it's money.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.075
- I know it, I know it, I know it...
- It's shoes.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.072
I knew it.

07:26.240 --> 07:30.995
Shoes. Al, what kind of numskull
would hide shoes in a shoe store?

07:31.240 --> 07:33.117
Me.

07:33.360 --> 07:36.750
I didn't like doing inventory
in the '70s either.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.398
The '70s.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.154
The clothes, the shoes, the music.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.675
Boy, did they suck.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.631
Come on,
help me wall this stuff back up.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.110
Oh, no, no, no. Wait a second, Al.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.510
Don't you know what's going on
in the world?

07:53.760 --> 07:57.070
Oh, look at me, Jefferson.
You know that I don't.

07:57.280 --> 08:01.034
Al, '70s fashions
are back in style now.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.875
These shoes, my friend,
are worth a lot of money.

08:05.120 --> 08:08.749
Yeah, right. These shoes cost
less than 20 bucks back then.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.630
I know those shoes.
They were called Foxy Ladies.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.872
I'll give you $200 for those.
Who do I pay?

08:17.080 --> 08:18.832
Oh, yeah.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.675
Jefferson, 100 bucks each.
You know what this means?

08:23.880 --> 08:27.031
You have to put great sex off
for some other night?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.390
Put it off?
Hell, I'm having it right now.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.356
Hi, I'm Terry Murphy
with What's Hip in Chicago.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.875
And today I'm standing
in what used to be called...

08:59.080 --> 09:03.198
...Gary's Shoes and Accessories,
but thanks to the genius of one man...

09:03.440 --> 09:06.000
That's... That's two men.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.351
Two men.
- The hip, the trendy and pathetic...

09:09.560 --> 09:12.677
...are flocking
to Al Bundy's House of Sole.

09:12.920 --> 09:16.435
And now I'd like you to meet
the shoe guru himself...

09:16.640 --> 09:19.518
...Mr. Al Bundy.

09:45.600 --> 09:49.309
Four touchdowns in one game,
you say?

09:50.880 --> 09:52.791
My, isn't that something?

09:53.040 --> 09:55.474
But for the few viewers we have left,
Mr. Bundy...

09:55.720 --> 09:58.473
...what inspired you to create
this environment?

09:58.720 --> 10:01.109
Well, you see, Terr...

10:01.360 --> 10:03.237
You don't mind if I call you Terr,
do you?

10:03.480 --> 10:04.549
Yes, I mind.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.752
Oh, well, you see, Terr,
I think that the...

10:08.840 --> 10:13.197
I think the '70s symbolizes
the very best in America.

10:13.400 --> 10:17.439
Take The Avengers, the Shelby Cobra,
"Bad Moon Rising."

10:17.680 --> 10:20.148
That was the '60s.

10:21.920 --> 10:26.516
Well, take Miami Vice, the DeLorean,
"Ebony and Ivory."

10:26.760 --> 10:28.478
That was the '80s.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.716
Well, what happened in the '70s?

10:32.920 --> 10:36.469
The Ford Pinto, Diff'rent Strok es
and Billy Beer.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.432
This is Terry Murphy
for What's Hip in Chicago...

10:43.680 --> 10:47.514
...wishing I were Terry Murphy
for What's Hip in L.A.

10:47.760 --> 10:50.354
Diff'rent Strok es, really?

10:51.360 --> 10:55.319
Back to you, Bob. Cut.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.397
Well, Dad, as near as I can count...

11:12.600 --> 11:16.354
...you got 30 crates back there
with 10 pair of shoes per crate.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.834
Oh, man.

11:18.080 --> 11:21.993
That's 30 times something shoes.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.990
That's exactly what Kelly said.

11:27.240 --> 11:29.754
Right after, she said
your lack of parental guidance...

11:29.960 --> 11:32.349
...was directly responsible
for her low self-esteem...

11:32.560 --> 11:35.028
...and has coloured her relationship
with all men.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.394
Oh, and your feet stink.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.713
But she's still gonna model for me,
isn't she?

11:41.960 --> 11:43.871
- Yeah.
- Then what are you bothering me for?

11:44.080 --> 11:45.433
Go count some shoes.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.189
Hey, Al.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.557
We've cleared over 5 grand
today already.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.439
And the more we raise the price,
the more they want them.

11:55.680 --> 11:56.908
Oh, man.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.793
- Oh, women are idiots.
- Yeah.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.516
- You gotta love them.
- Yeah.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.108
I gotta have some.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.317
Not now, Marcie, I'm working.

12:18.560 --> 12:22.109
Not you, a pair of these shoes.

12:22.360 --> 12:25.716
Do you know what I was doing the last
time I was wearing shoes like these?

12:25.960 --> 12:30.317
Inspiring Helen Reddy to write
her new song "I Am Poultry"?

12:35.840 --> 12:38.638
Sitting with my friends
in a room full of incense...

12:38.880 --> 12:41.917
...singing protest songs
like "Who'll Stop the Rain"...

12:42.160 --> 12:45.835
..."Everyday People,"
"Kung Fu Fighting."

12:46.800 --> 12:49.758
Our generation wasn't hung up
on material things.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.673
- Do you have these in a nine?
- Give me those, they're mine!

12:52.920 --> 12:55.115
Hey. Hey, now. Whoa, now.
Ladies. Ladie...

12:55.320 --> 12:57.788
Now, my little super freak.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.191
Now, there's a lot more
where this came from.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.710
Kelly, a pair of Honey Wests, please.

13:12.600 --> 13:16.149
Kelly, those shoes are so far-out.

13:16.400 --> 13:21.554
They're trippy, they're groovy,
they're uptight, out of sight.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.028
What do you think?

13:24.000 --> 13:27.072
- Truthfully?
- Of course.

13:27.960 --> 13:31.509
Well, since you asked, I think that
there's nothing more pathetic...

13:31.720 --> 13:34.393
...than trying to relive your glory days
through your feet.

13:35.520 --> 13:39.513
Much like your hairstyle, Mrs. D'Arcy,
the '70s are history.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.029
It's just you
and Alvin the Chipmunk now.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.879
At least he has a pleasant voice.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.915
You'll have to forgive Kelly
for that Alvin crack.

13:55.160 --> 13:58.357
Personally, I think your voice
sounds like Simon.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.030
So, what are you gonna do
with your share, Al?

14:07.280 --> 14:09.350
I always said
if I came into a little money...

14:09.560 --> 14:13.075
...I'd spread it around the community.
You know, give a little to charity.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.950
Of course, I just said that.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.399
Yeah, I'll probably spend it all
on hookers and booze.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.991
Or her.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.115
Al. Al, that's Dominique...

14:36.360 --> 14:38.828
...the highest-paid lingerie model
in the world.

14:39.080 --> 14:42.755
Page 36, Soft and Slinky catalogue.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.673
The plum-Lycra teddy?

14:46.120 --> 14:49.635
I didn't recognize her
not straddling a cannon.

14:50.760 --> 14:54.309
- Hi. Can somebody help me?
- Yes.

14:56.280 --> 15:01.673
My name is Al Bundy,
and I was born to rock your world.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.355
Well, that answered
none of my questions.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.034
I'm booked to appear on a TV special
this weekend...

15:10.240 --> 15:12.879
...and I need some really funky shoes
to wear.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.599
This is where you talk.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.029
Oh, shoes? Oh, we got shoes.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.589
Yeah, here's some shoes.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.309
Oh, I like these.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.279
- How much?
- For what?

15:37.520 --> 15:39.078
- Oh, shoes?
- The shoes.

15:39.280 --> 15:42.556
Oh, we got shoes.
Here's some shoes.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.074
How much?

15:44.320 --> 15:47.232
Well, for you I could probably
let them go for...

15:47.480 --> 15:48.913
Free.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.716
I wouldn't feel comfortable
just taking them.

15:51.960 --> 15:56.238
No. I wouldn't feel comfortable
just giving them to you.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.755
No, no, they're yours...

15:59.000 --> 16:03.596
...providing, when you're on the show,
you mention where you got them.

16:03.800 --> 16:04.994
That sounds fair.

16:05.240 --> 16:10.189
You know, that's very, very kind of you.
I'll do it. Al Bundy's House of Sole.

16:10.440 --> 16:14.558
Yeah, where the shoes are free
and the salesmen are morons.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.435
What the hell did you do that for?

16:20.680 --> 16:23.956
Al, it's a plug on network television.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.589
Network, it means the whole country.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.155
Not if it's NBC.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.319
Look, Al, don't you see?

16:34.560 --> 16:37.358
If she mentions the name of the store
on TV...

16:37.600 --> 16:40.273
...we can sell these shoes
for anything we want.

16:40.520 --> 16:43.796
This could be the biggest thing
that ever happened to you.

16:44.560 --> 16:46.994
Bigger than high school football?

16:48.320 --> 16:51.517
Even bigger than that.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.035
God.

16:54.240 --> 16:58.472
- Dad, you're out of shoes.
- Of course.

16:58.720 --> 17:02.633
- Are you sure about this, Bud?
- What do I look like, an idiot?

17:08.920 --> 17:11.150
You're still out of shoes.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.914
And you still look like an idiot.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.388
All right, no problem.

17:16.599 --> 17:19.990
Now, there's gotta be dozens
of shoemakers in the phone book.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.431
We'll just... We'll call one,
have him copy the shoes we have...

17:23.680 --> 17:27.388
...and we'll say they're authentic.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.676
Jefferson, won't making
all these new shoes...

17:29.880 --> 17:31.632
...cost more money
than we already have?

17:31.840 --> 17:35.594
No sweat.
We'll refinance your house.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.792
Yeah, that should be easy
to get a sixth.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.198
I gotta hand it to you, Jefferson...

17:51.440 --> 17:53.635
...these knockoffs look just like
the originals.

17:53.880 --> 17:57.031
Well, if you want the best,
you've gotta go to the best.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.794
If it wouldn't be too much trouble
for thee...

18:03.040 --> 18:06.077
...might I have a little
air conditioning?

18:12.120 --> 18:14.714
No, thee may "noot."

18:17.000 --> 18:20.310
Now, any more complaints out of you,
I'm gonna have your buckboard towed.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.511
Now, get back in there to work.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.276
Please, I gotta have these.
How much?

18:25.480 --> 18:26.754
Oh, we don't know yet, ma'am.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.389
The price won't be fixed
for a few more minutes.

18:29.640 --> 18:33.918
All right, ladies, it's shoe time.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.432
Excuse me.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.948
Live at the Kennedy Center...

18:41.200 --> 18:46.354
...welcome to Fox's first annual
Lingerie Award.

18:46.600 --> 18:51.071
And here's our host, Dominique.

18:53.680 --> 18:56.797
Not the body, you idiots, the shoes.
Show the shoes.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.632
Before I present the first award...

18:58.840 --> 19:02.230
...I'd lik e to thank a very special man
who has shoed my world.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.550
- We're rich.
- Goodbye, Peg.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.473
Hello, everybody else.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.916
These shoes were a special gift...

19:12.120 --> 19:16.113
...given to me by Al Bundy
of Al Bundy's House of Sole.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.112
- Yes!
- Yes!

19:19.520 --> 19:21.078
Methinks the price be fixed now.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.435
And now, for the category
of Best Supporting Bra...

19:27.680 --> 19:30.877
...in a comedy, musical
or news special...

19:32.160 --> 19:35.914
Oh, my God, Dominique just fell
into the orchestra pit.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.559
Ladies and gentlemen...

19:37.760 --> 19:41.548
...the heel of Dominique's shoe
has fallen off.

19:42.360 --> 19:44.351
It appears she has,
at the very least...

19:44.560 --> 19:49.588
...brok en her leg in one, two,
three places.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.876
Hello, Peg.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.475
Goodbye, everybody else.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.314
And it's all because
of one shoddy shoe...

19:59.520 --> 20:01.795
...from Al Bundy's House of Sole.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.837
You know,
why don't they just spell it?

20:04.080 --> 20:09.632
That's A-L B-U-N-D-Y apostrophe S
House of Sole.

20:11.720 --> 20:15.190
Serving number one.
Serving... Serving number two.

20:15.440 --> 20:20.514
Serving... Serving three through 99.

20:20.720 --> 20:25.077
Serving life
without the possibility of parole!

20:26.360 --> 20:28.510
So it is true that one of thy shoes...

20:28.760 --> 20:31.433
...hast broken the leg
of fabulous supermodel Dominique?

20:31.680 --> 20:32.749
Afraid so.

20:32.960 --> 20:36.111
Thou art waist-deep
in the big muddy.

20:37.240 --> 20:40.232
Waist-deep and upside down.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.153
Go raise a barn, Hiram.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.390
Well, listen, Al...

20:47.640 --> 20:51.269
...if there's anything I can do,
you just name it.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.829
- Well, Jefferson, you...
- See you.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.999
Well, I guess there's nothing
left to do...

21:03.280 --> 21:04.918
...but close up.
