WEBVTT

00:03.169 --> 00:04.904
Thanks for coming out!
Thanks for watching!

00:04.904 --> 00:06.098
Love, peace, and hair grease!

00:08.508 --> 00:11.611
Hey, Liz. Me, Lutz, Toofer, and Josh
are going to go to that bar

00:11.611 --> 00:13.580
where the waiters are dressed like ninjas.

00:13.580 --> 00:14.774
You in?

00:18.018 --> 00:18.985
All right.

00:19.252 --> 00:20.219
Donuts and then bed.

00:20.487 --> 00:22.222
What are you depressed about or celebrating?

00:23.323 --> 00:24.791
It's this endless adoption process.

00:24.791 --> 00:25.792
It took me three months --

00:25.792 --> 00:26.926
Liz.

00:26.926 --> 00:28.291
I am totally humiliated.

00:28.495 --> 00:31.055
How could you cut "Diaper Chicken"?
Wait. I know.

00:31.164 --> 00:33.223
Because Tracy's the star.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.302
Oh, brother.
She's feeling neglected.

00:36.302 --> 00:37.860
How's she going to act out this time?

00:38.271 --> 00:40.364
My ankle!

00:40.573 --> 00:42.700
Oh, "Imaginary injury."

00:42.842 --> 00:44.503
I would have said
"death of a voice coach."

00:45.011 --> 00:46.212
Her birthday's on Tuesday.

00:46.212 --> 00:49.010
Maybe all that attention
will make her ankle feel better.

00:49.482 --> 00:50.449
Hey. Jack.

00:50.617 --> 00:51.948
What are you still doing here?

00:52.052 --> 00:54.213
It's Friday night.
I need something to do.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.589
Well, don't you have some gallery opening

00:56.589 --> 00:59.752
or a fundraiser to give bow ties
to inner city youths?

00:59.926 --> 01:00.893
Of course.

01:01.094 --> 01:02.662
But I'm committed to Elisa.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.730
While she's away,
I'm trying to avoid temptation.

01:04.730 --> 01:08.132
I just need somewhere I can socialize
where women aren't an issue.

01:10.270 --> 01:11.237
Yeah, Let's go.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.538
Hey, now.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:32.358 --> 01:33.416
Excuse me.

01:36.729 --> 01:38.198
Dude, I know you're getting these messages

01:38.198 --> 01:40.300
because I know how to check your voice mail.

01:40.300 --> 01:44.566
You are officially a "D-bag", Tim.
I hope you lose your indoor soccer game.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.202
Sorry. What can I get you?

01:48.341 --> 01:50.710
A dozen assorted for me
to take home to my family.

01:50.710 --> 01:52.109
And the lady will have...

01:59.052 --> 02:00.019
Adoption brochure.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.651
Should you be working
the night shift alone like this?

02:04.991 --> 02:06.793
It's fine.
They gave me a gun.

02:08.161 --> 02:09.127
That's $6.80.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.561
I will have mine to stay, please.

02:11.764 --> 02:13.163
You want a dozen donuts to stay?

02:13.266 --> 02:14.233
And a skim milk.

02:15.435 --> 02:16.569
What are you doing, Liz?

02:16.569 --> 02:17.637
Making a new friend.

02:17.637 --> 02:18.671
I don't like that you have crazy-eyes.

02:18.671 --> 02:19.672
Oh, shut up, mouth.

02:19.672 --> 02:20.940
I don't want to be part of this.

02:20.940 --> 02:21.929
Then, get out of here.

02:25.578 --> 02:27.443
Boy, that creative thing you guys do...

02:27.580 --> 02:30.276
Writing jokes for a living,
making the world laugh.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.319
What do your dads...

02:33.319 --> 02:34.581
tell their friends you do?

02:34.888 --> 02:35.855
Surgeon.

02:36.122 --> 02:37.089
Optometrist.

02:37.290 --> 02:38.257
Died.

02:38.858 --> 02:40.994
I never really knew my dad, so...

02:40.994 --> 02:41.983
I just lie to myself.

02:42.295 --> 02:43.262
Space assassin.

02:44.130 --> 02:45.654
I grew up without a father too, Frank.

02:45.765 --> 02:47.600
Good old Billy Donaghy
left when I was two.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.195
He'd... show up every now and then
to impregnate my mom...

02:51.905 --> 02:53.640
punch out umpires at my Little League...

02:53.640 --> 02:57.944
Last time I saw my dad, he went out to
get the candles for my fourth birthday lasagna...

02:57.944 --> 02:59.479
...and never came back.

02:59.479 --> 03:01.572
My whole life I said
I was gonna be something.

03:01.648 --> 03:02.882
Restore the glory...

03:02.882 --> 03:04.509
...of the Rossitano name.

03:04.751 --> 03:07.242
In Sicilian dialect,
it means "well poisoner."

03:07.420 --> 03:09.888
In Gaelic, Donaghy means "dung basket."

03:10.323 --> 03:13.224
So I worked my ass off at SUNY,
got in to Fordham Law...

03:13.560 --> 03:14.561
No.

03:14.561 --> 03:15.695
You went to law school?

03:15.695 --> 03:16.662
Yeah.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.698
But I had to drop out after a semester

03:18.698 --> 03:19.665
because my mom got sick.

03:20.567 --> 03:21.534
Mothers.

03:22.602 --> 03:25.572
So what are we doing next, fellows?
Don't tell me we're calling it a night already.

03:25.572 --> 03:26.873
How lame do you think we are?

03:26.873 --> 03:29.273
The night is young!
We're going to Lutz's to watch movies.

03:29.475 --> 03:31.136
Tonight, a classic.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.838
Harry and the Hendersons.
You in, Jack?

03:34.080 --> 03:36.716
Uh, yes. But I don't want
to go to Lutz's apartment.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.586
His contract is up, and I
don't want to feel sorry for him.

03:39.586 --> 03:40.780
What do you say we go to my place?

03:40.887 --> 03:41.854
- Yeah.
- Sounds good.

03:42.689 --> 03:45.491
And when I told Tim I was pregnant,
he just freaked out

03:45.491 --> 03:47.093
and didn't call me for a week.

03:47.093 --> 03:50.296
Then, he texted me,
and he was like, "Oh, I love you.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.764
...No, I'm mad at you.
You did this on purpose." As if!

03:53.199 --> 03:57.329
Meanwhile, his MyFace page
- horny."

03:57.704 --> 03:59.839
And I'm like, "If you care about me at all,

03:59.839 --> 04:01.932
at least have the decency
to "skype" me face to face.

04:02.141 --> 04:05.612
Man. There are just so many different devices

04:05.612 --> 04:07.981
for guys to not call you on now.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.549
When I was your age, you could just be like,

04:09.549 --> 04:12.352
"Oh, he probably tried to call me,
but my line was busy."

04:12.352 --> 04:13.419
And then just...

04:13.419 --> 04:15.580
...watch Falcon Crest and cry yourself to sleep.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.553
Thanks for listening to me blab.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.562
So what's your plan...

04:22.562 --> 04:23.529
when the baby comes?

04:23.663 --> 04:25.324
I don't know...

04:25.565 --> 04:27.166
I've been talking to an adoption lady,

04:27.166 --> 04:29.135
but I just don't feel comfortable
with any of the people.

04:29.135 --> 04:31.660
They all just seemed really old and weird.

04:31.838 --> 04:34.671
Not one of them even knew who Ne-Yo is.

04:36.009 --> 04:39.274
# I need you...

04:39.579 --> 04:42.446
Finally! Thank you!
Somebody cool, for once.

04:45.251 --> 04:46.616
Get out of here!

04:47.287 --> 04:49.118
Can't you see we don't want you anymore?

04:50.390 --> 04:52.585
Why can't you go back
where you came from?

04:52.892 --> 04:54.553
And leave us alone!

05:00.533 --> 05:01.500
Go.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.003
Go!

05:12.211 --> 05:13.508
Goodbye, my friend.

05:15.181 --> 05:17.274
He had to be mean to save him.

05:18.017 --> 05:19.985
Harry belonged in the woods.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.012
It gets me every time.

05:22.922 --> 05:25.083
This reminds me of my favorite movie.

05:25.658 --> 05:26.716
Shane.

05:27.093 --> 05:29.862
Oh! When Joey wants to go with Shane...

05:29.862 --> 05:31.124
and Shane makes him stay.

05:31.731 --> 05:33.926
Maybe it's because we didn't have fathers.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.002
Maybe that's why we're drawn to movies

05:36.002 --> 05:41.338
where the father figure pushes away the
child/legendary North American forest ape.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.336
Yeah, but... in the movies,
it's a good thing.

05:44.877 --> 05:46.071
Harry went back to the woods.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.810
It works out in real life too.
We're both doing all right.

05:50.983 --> 05:51.950
Yeah.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.717
Excuse me, Mr. Jordan.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.696
I was just updating my staff birthday list,

06:03.696 --> 06:04.993
and I discovered I don't have yours.

06:05.164 --> 06:06.866
That's because I don't have a birthday, Ken.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.034
What?

06:08.034 --> 06:11.371
I don't have a birth certificate because
I was born inside of Yankee Stadium.

06:15.341 --> 06:17.977
Oh, but even prisoners have birthday parties.

06:17.977 --> 06:19.501
I saw one on Oz.

06:19.679 --> 06:20.646
It was...

06:20.813 --> 06:21.814
interesting.

06:25.752 --> 06:28.380
And because of my drinking,
they're often a surprise.

06:28.454 --> 06:30.723
Oh, but birthdays aren't about presents.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.892
They're about being surrounded
by people who love you

06:32.892 --> 06:35.194
and eating a cake with your name on it

06:35.194 --> 06:36.752
and making a wish.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.295
I'm sad you've never had that.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.035
My birthday's September 21st.

06:43.035 --> 06:44.002
Not that anyone asked.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.066
- Hi, Frank.
- Oh. Hey, Jack.

06:47.306 --> 06:51.140
This morning it hit me in the shower
why the Hendersons named their guest "Harry."

06:51.210 --> 06:52.278
Yeah.

06:52.278 --> 06:53.413
That film has layers.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.582
I was also thinking about what you
told me about your family

06:56.582 --> 06:57.583
and law school.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.450
Yeah, sorry. I was drunk.
I shouldn't have told you that stuff.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.919
No, no, no. I'm glad you did.
We have a lot in common.

07:02.989 --> 07:05.958
We both have recurring dreams about
being overpowered by a female bodybuilder.

07:06.192 --> 07:07.293
Okay.

07:07.293 --> 07:08.260
We were both drunk.

07:08.661 --> 07:09.821
But I want to help you.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.697
So I made some phone calls,

07:11.697 --> 07:14.300
and if you want, you can
resume your law studies

07:14.300 --> 07:15.535
at Columbia.

07:15.535 --> 07:16.536
This semester.

07:16.536 --> 07:17.503
Full scholarship.

07:18.004 --> 07:19.130
No strings attached.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.902
Are you serious?

07:21.140 --> 07:22.505
Make your mother proud, Frank.

07:22.975 --> 07:26.001
Make your father hate
any new children he might have.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.507
But...

07:27.680 --> 07:29.147
I... I've got a whole other life now.

07:30.249 --> 07:31.409
I guess.

07:31.851 --> 07:34.319
But we both know you shouldn't
be working at a desk with...

07:35.021 --> 07:36.147
...fake vomit on it.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.125
Right.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.092
Fake.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.520
Excuse me.

07:43.763 --> 07:45.526
Oh, God. Please don't be
a daughter I didn't know about.

07:46.232 --> 07:47.366
Becca!

07:48.401 --> 07:50.596
Oh. Congratulations.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.005
What is she doing here?

07:57.977 --> 07:59.103
Oh, my God.

07:59.445 --> 08:01.214
I can't believe you're in charge of all of this.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.287
Welcome.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.286
Um... So, do you want me to
start Youth Consulting now?

08:11.757 --> 08:13.759
Because kids would not be into that.

08:17.029 --> 08:20.055
Kenneth, this is the dress
I'll be wearing to my birthday party.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.558
Please make sure no one else
plans to wear the same thing.

08:22.768 --> 08:23.735
Yes, ma'am.

08:23.803 --> 08:27.068
Did you know Mr. Jordan has
never had a birthday party?

08:28.808 --> 08:31.038
Oh! That's horrible.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.746
My heart goes out to all the inner city kids.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.976
Especially those too fat
to dance their way out.

08:36.148 --> 08:39.150
I'm glad you feel that way.
Because we have this big party planned for you.

08:39.150 --> 08:40.385
I know!

08:40.385 --> 08:42.989
And we thought you could
share it with Mr. Jordan!

08:45.324 --> 08:46.552
Isn't that a great idea?

08:49.829 --> 08:51.922
That's so great!

08:52.632 --> 08:55.032
I can't believe Tim hasn't called.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.870
I guess I don't even care about us...
anymore.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.599
But this is his baby.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.837
I mean, him not even being there
for the kid is totally washed.

09:03.109 --> 09:04.303
Typical Tim.

09:06.846 --> 09:07.847
Anyway...

09:07.847 --> 09:09.282
I guess I have two choices.

09:09.282 --> 09:12.649
Go back home, try to get back
with Tim, and keep the baby, or...

09:13.386 --> 09:15.513
give up the baby and focus on my music.

09:15.688 --> 09:20.887
So... Tim, keep baby.
Music, give up baby.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.054
Can I play you one of my songs?

09:24.230 --> 09:26.032
# Now, we are joined...?

09:26.032 --> 09:28.968
# in a cobweb of rainbows...?

09:28.968 --> 09:30.002
Stop.

09:31.270 --> 09:32.259
Tears.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.831
The world needs to hear your music.

09:38.844 --> 09:40.413
You have crossed a line, Liz Lemon.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.248
Becca's never going to
make it with those songs.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.818
Says who? Being terrible has never
prevented success in the music business.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.649
Look at Biz Markie or The Doors.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.022
Look, before we were
happily married with five kids,

09:50.022 --> 09:52.325
Paula and I were Tim and Becca.
And I can tell you right now,

09:52.325 --> 09:54.560
she is confused and he is terrified.

09:55.895 --> 09:56.884
So did I.

09:56.963 --> 09:58.988
Five times.
But I came back.

09:59.131 --> 10:02.702
And when my caveman brain
saw those babies...

10:02.702 --> 10:05.296
with their little Hornberger foreheads...

10:05.938 --> 10:08.839
...it clicked. You've got to give
Tim and Becca the same chance.

10:17.216 --> 10:18.205
Hey. What are you doing?

10:18.851 --> 10:22.252
My pregnant teen message board says
the baby gets all its food from the mother.

10:22.321 --> 10:24.050
So, you have to give it stuff it likes.

10:24.256 --> 10:27.714
No, the baby can't taste anything.
It just gets nutrients from you.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.363
I'm going to post a reply to Juno 32

10:30.363 --> 10:31.887
and tell her she's a giant ass wipe.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.167
I can't believe you don't have kids.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.191
What's that?

10:39.538 --> 10:41.335
Well, you'd make such a great mom.

10:41.607 --> 10:44.110
You're smart, successful, grounded...

10:44.110 --> 10:45.244
Oh... Go on.

10:45.244 --> 10:46.412
You already dress like a mom.

10:46.412 --> 10:47.640
...And stop.

10:48.047 --> 10:50.311
It's not the right time
for me to have a family, but...

10:51.450 --> 10:52.542
is that something you'd want?

10:52.885 --> 10:53.852
Yeah, Becca. It is.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.521
Will you sing with me, Liz?

10:56.622 --> 11:00.718
# Mothers and fathers...
and jugglers and judges...?

11:01.093 --> 11:05.792
# Now, we are joined
in a cobweb of rainbows...?

11:06.932 --> 11:08.467
He's coming!
The plan is working!

11:08.467 --> 11:09.559
I bit my tongue!

11:12.872 --> 11:14.271
Surprise!

11:17.443 --> 11:20.037
What a schmo, entering first.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.448
Now, I'm the headliner,
and he's just the warm-up act.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.882
I'm Mr. Don Rickles and he's just me.

11:25.117 --> 11:26.584
But I don't have a birthday.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.846
You do now.

11:28.087 --> 11:31.352
Because we all love you and
wanted you to feel this joy.

11:31.590 --> 11:32.852
I do feel it.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.094
You are all so amazing.

11:35.094 --> 11:38.393
And to think I was just calling
y'all a bunch of racists.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.398
Aw...

11:40.466 --> 11:42.234
Stop...

11:42.234 --> 11:43.201
Jenna time.

11:43.502 --> 11:44.469
Friends.

11:44.603 --> 11:48.607
I am leaving T.G.S.
for Columbia Law School

11:48.607 --> 11:51.735
to pursue my dream of becoming a lawyer.

11:57.049 --> 12:00.746
Did you know that if you sing "Happy Birthday"
on a TV show, you have to pay for it?

12:00.920 --> 12:01.921
I did not know that.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.055
# Hap...?

12:03.055 --> 12:04.090
Hey!

12:04.090 --> 12:05.991
My dad got us all seats for Opening Day

12:05.991 --> 12:07.117
at the new Yankee Stadium!

12:11.030 --> 12:14.033
Cerie! Cerie! Cerie!

12:14.033 --> 12:15.625
Cerie! Cerie! Cerie!

12:15.768 --> 12:17.203
Oh. Ow.

12:17.203 --> 12:18.170
Cerie! Cerie!

12:18.170 --> 12:20.263
No one ask me about my back brace.

12:21.874 --> 12:24.399
Make a wish, Mr. Jordan.
Blow out the candles.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.582
Cerie, Frank, and Tracy!

12:29.582 --> 12:32.118
No one ask about my back brace!

12:32.118 --> 12:33.686
Cerie, Frank, and Tracy!

12:37.189 --> 12:38.491
Hey, Jack.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.686
Frank. Is that you?

12:41.227 --> 12:42.795
I decided to take you up on your offer.

12:42.795 --> 12:45.131
Good man!
And you went to my tailor.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.503
My mom is going nuts.
She's insisting you come over

12:50.503 --> 12:51.604
and let her cook you dinner.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.697
Home cooked Italian?
I'm there.

12:53.806 --> 12:56.242
Now, let me hear you say
the seven most important words

12:56.242 --> 12:57.573
in the American Judicial System.

12:57.843 --> 12:58.935
My client...

12:59.145 --> 13:00.112
has no memory of that.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.549
I also would have accepted,
"You can't prove that's the governor's semen."

13:03.549 --> 13:04.583
Okay.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.458
What's the matter, Mr. Jordan?

13:15.161 --> 13:17.925
You were right, Ken.
Birthdays are special.

13:17.997 --> 13:21.865
And now, mine is over. And who knows
when February 24th will come again?

13:22.101 --> 13:24.103
Now, that warm, happy feeling is gone,

13:24.103 --> 13:27.698
there's no cake in my mouth,
and that birthday wish is malarkey.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.033
Malarkey!

13:31.277 --> 13:32.244
Come on, Daniel!

13:35.381 --> 13:37.110
I am so proud of you.

13:37.349 --> 13:38.818
A lawyer!

13:38.818 --> 13:42.621
Someday, you'll have an ad on
the subway in English and Spanish.

13:42.621 --> 13:43.789
Yeah.

13:43.789 --> 13:47.350
And this man.
What you have done for my boy...

13:48.060 --> 13:49.495
Frankie.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.395
Go open up some more wine.

13:51.597 --> 13:52.564
You got it, Ma.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.829
What do you think you're doing to my boy?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.272
I'm trying to help him.

14:00.272 --> 14:01.574
I see myself in Frank.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.269
We both have fathers that abandoned us --

14:03.342 --> 14:05.003
What do you know about his father?

14:05.244 --> 14:07.680
You want Frank to be a lawyer
so he won't be like his father?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.549
His father was a lawyer!
And his father's father!

14:10.549 --> 14:13.652
All the Rossitano men are lawyers.
It's in their blood to be lawyers!

14:13.652 --> 14:14.720
Then, what's the prob --

14:14.720 --> 14:15.855
For the mob!

14:15.855 --> 14:17.590
What?

14:17.590 --> 14:19.387
Frankie's father didn't abandon him.

14:19.558 --> 14:21.355
He's in hiding in Phoenix.

14:21.727 --> 14:25.595
Every Rossitano man is either
in hiding or six feet under.

14:26.732 --> 14:28.222
You want me to paint you a picture?

14:28.300 --> 14:29.631
Because I did.

14:31.237 --> 14:34.104
It's part of a therapy through painting thing.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.674
I had no idea.

14:35.841 --> 14:37.536
Well, you should have guessed.

14:38.677 --> 14:39.845
I don't think I should have.

14:39.845 --> 14:40.812
Whatever.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.716
I am not going to take
my kid's dream away from him.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.084
You made this mess.
You clean it up.

14:45.084 --> 14:46.652
I don't care how.

14:46.652 --> 14:51.351
But Francis Rossitano cannot become a lawyer.

14:53.993 --> 14:55.261
Yeah. Hold on a second.

14:55.261 --> 14:57.058
Liz. Do you know a Tim?

14:57.296 --> 14:58.263
What? Why?

14:58.464 --> 15:00.659
Security says that there's
a Tim Baker downstairs.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.199
Here? He came here?
That's Becca's ex-boyfriend.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.101
He's coming to steal my baby.

15:14.546 --> 15:17.049
Don't even ask
about the wheelchair.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.016
Okay.

15:18.317 --> 15:20.512
Also, my old vocal coach died!

15:21.921 --> 15:23.650
Come on, come on...

15:24.990 --> 15:25.957
Lemon, are you okay?

15:26.125 --> 15:28.958
That pregnant girl?
She was going to give me her baby.

15:29.028 --> 15:31.697
But now, the dad is here.
He's going to ruin everything.

15:31.697 --> 15:32.898
What are you about to do?

15:32.898 --> 15:35.992
I'm the one who's been there for Becca.
For almost two days!

15:38.837 --> 15:39.804
Lemon...

15:40.039 --> 15:42.132
There was once a great American
named George Henderson.

15:43.175 --> 15:45.377
He met a woodland ape, or Sasquatch,

15:45.377 --> 15:49.682
who, despite its dangerous message
of environmentalism, became his friend.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.317
But when the time came to do the hard thing

15:51.317 --> 15:53.452
and send it back into the
forest where it belonged...

15:53.452 --> 15:56.021
and birds could perch on its
shoulder because it was gentle...

15:56.021 --> 16:00.355
George Henderson summoned
the strength, and, by God, he did it.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.895
Did it hurt?
You bet it hurt.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.530
Like a bastard.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.896
But he did it because
it was the right thing to do.

16:08.534 --> 16:09.501
For the woodland ape.

16:10.836 --> 16:11.803
You think about that.

16:12.771 --> 16:14.238
What?

16:16.875 --> 16:18.570
Is that Harry and the Hendersons?

16:18.978 --> 16:19.945
You've seen it?

16:20.012 --> 16:21.570
This is my life, Jack.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.213
Oh my! Miss Maroney, are you okay?

16:29.688 --> 16:32.088
Well, I think I'll be okay
in time for tomorrow's show.

16:32.558 --> 16:34.793
But then, I have to go in for more tests.

16:34.793 --> 16:36.055
I'm so brave.

16:36.395 --> 16:38.664
Oh. I wish you felt better

16:38.664 --> 16:41.656
so you could help us figure out what
Mr. Jordan's birthday wish could have been.

16:41.767 --> 16:42.734
What? Why?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.470
So we can make it come true,

16:44.470 --> 16:46.705
and his birthday can go on and on.

16:46.705 --> 16:48.374
We've narrowed it down to...

16:48.374 --> 16:49.942
own a RoboCop,

16:49.942 --> 16:52.077
hunt that elephant that paints,

16:52.077 --> 16:53.806
or breakfast in bed.

16:53.912 --> 16:55.647
But it wasn't his birthday!

16:55.647 --> 16:58.582
It was my birthday!
Oh, forget it.

16:58.784 --> 17:01.420
I'm tired of making you
people try to care for me.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.615
You don't care for me, clearly.

17:04.022 --> 17:04.990
Nobody does.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.027
My birthday wish came true!

17:09.028 --> 17:10.551
I wished for you to get better.

17:10.628 --> 17:13.098
I was going to wish for breakfast
in bed with RoboCop

17:13.098 --> 17:14.565
while that elephant paints us.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.666
We were close.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.999
But then, I saw you with that back brace on
right before I blew out my candles.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.762
It's a birthday miracle!

17:21.240 --> 17:24.868
Tracy, that's the kindest thing
anyone has ever done for me!

17:27.546 --> 17:29.948
Now, let's make Miss Maroney's
birthday wish come true!

17:29.948 --> 17:31.383
Oh, that's so sweet.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.908
But who would I celebrate with
if y'all were in a car accident?

17:44.296 --> 17:45.864
I'm her friend.
Jenna.

17:45.864 --> 17:48.333
And she does not want to see you.
She's very mad,

17:48.333 --> 17:49.425
and she wants you to leave.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.565
Okay. That's, uh...

17:52.704 --> 17:54.137
That's for the best. Yeah.

17:55.974 --> 17:57.109
Excuse me.

17:57.109 --> 17:59.578
Uh... What floor is the
Sci-Fi Channel on?

17:59.578 --> 18:02.815
Ugh! Fine, Lithgow!
I'll do the right thing.

18:02.815 --> 18:03.782
God!

18:04.049 --> 18:06.609
I guess someone's been watching
The World According to Garp.

18:07.186 --> 18:08.619
Damn it.
Tim, wait.

18:11.623 --> 18:14.285
No, when you said she didn't want
to see me, it was such a relief.

18:14.693 --> 18:16.528
This baby thing is freaking me out.

18:16.528 --> 18:19.531
Do you know how many people want
what just got dropped in your lap?

18:19.531 --> 18:22.864
"Oh, now is not a good time.
I want to go to Burning Man." Shut up, Tim!

18:23.135 --> 18:24.102
Do you love Becca?

18:24.203 --> 18:25.604
She's like my soul mate. I mean...

18:25.604 --> 18:27.162
You're not listening, dummy!

18:32.878 --> 18:35.581
And get married and have
disposable cameras at the wedding

18:35.581 --> 18:37.310
because it's fun and people like it.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.777
Where are we going?
I already cleaned out my office.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.024
You've got to go.

18:46.425 --> 18:48.093
No. I'm going to be a lawyer.

18:48.093 --> 18:49.526
I'm going to be like you.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.657
Get out of here!

18:53.265 --> 18:55.699
Go to the writers' room!
There is no scholarship!

18:56.101 --> 18:57.903
Can't you see we don't want you anymore?

19:04.610 --> 19:06.077
Jack! I don't understand.

19:23.629 --> 19:25.430
Goodbye, my friend.

19:36.975 --> 19:37.942
Hey, baby.

19:39.545 --> 19:41.342
My God. Look at your boobs.

19:43.615 --> 19:46.015
Kiss or something. Go on.

19:52.891 --> 19:57.963
# The rainbows and the cobwebs
and the cobwebs and the rainbows...?

19:57.963 --> 19:58.930
And stop.

20:03.902 --> 20:05.771
I guess, in a way...

20:05.771 --> 20:08.569
we both... Iost children today.

20:08.807 --> 20:11.298
Yeah, but mine was real, Jack.
Yours was Frank.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.112
Don't worry, Lemon.
I'm confident that someday,

20:14.112 --> 20:15.447
you'll have...

20:15.447 --> 20:16.436
everything you want.

20:18.917 --> 20:21.186
Can someone please tell me
how to get out of this building?

20:21.186 --> 20:22.654
It's like a maze!

20:22.654 --> 20:25.487
I keep walking
past the same... Sbarro's!

20:26.291 --> 20:27.859
Yeah.

20:27.859 --> 20:30.623
I'm a celebrity! Please!

20:31.730 --> 20:32.697
Sad.
