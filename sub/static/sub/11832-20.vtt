He was so paranoid,
thinking I was using drugs.

11:08.090 --> 11:10.060
I finally got fed up.

11:10.060 --> 11:12.160
- Your father's fingerprints
are all night gun, not yours.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.070
- I had flipped out.

11:14.070 --> 11:15.230
I guess he thought I was
gonna attack him or something,

11:15.230 --> 11:17.200
because he went
and grabbed the gun

11:17.200 --> 11:19.060
he kept in the end table.

11:19.060 --> 11:21.020
- Your own father
pulled a gun on you?

11:21.020 --> 11:22.070
- Yeah.

11:22.070 --> 11:23.230
And then, I charged him

11:23.230 --> 11:26.010
and that's
when the gun went off.

11:26.010 --> 11:28.020
- If that's the truth,
why would you have even

11:28.020 --> 11:30.030
accused him
in the first place?

11:30.030 --> 11:32.200
- I-I guess I
was kind of in shock.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.160
And I thought
that if he went away for this

11:35.160 --> 11:39.140
then maybe he'd finally
be out of my life.

11:39.140 --> 11:41.000
- You really expect me
to believe this?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.150
- I know it sounds crazy

11:42.150 --> 11:44.110
but that was what was
going through my head.

11:44.110 --> 11:47.020
- Yes, and why would you wait
till now to change your story?

11:47.020 --> 11:49.190
- I just couldn't
go through with it.

11:49.190 --> 11:53.020
And this is not a story,
this is the truth.

11:53.020 --> 11:54.210
I was there, you weren't.

11:54.210 --> 11:56.120
- But I was
at the preliminary hearing

11:56.120 --> 11:58.210
where you testified that
your father shot your mother.

11:58.210 --> 12:01.040
- And that wasn't the truth.

12:01.040 --> 12:04.220

12:09.020 --> 12:11.030

to send your dad to prison--

12:11.030 --> 12:14.210

I did.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.220

12:25.220 --> 12:27.150

12:27.150 --> 12:29.060

there's more--

12:29.060 --> 12:31.100

that you're pretty popular.

12:34.090 --> 12:37.120

12:37.120 --> 12:39.060

12:49.060 --> 12:51.180
- No, I actually came

12:51.180 --> 12:54.010
to sort of hire a lawyer.

12:57.150 --> 13:00.120
Ellenor.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.050
Basically, he's recanting now
to save his dad.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.140
Which, since
he could now face perjury,

13:04.140 --> 13:06.190
makes me think
he needs his own lawyer.

13:06.190 --> 13:08.230
- And the reason
you want it to be me?

13:08.230 --> 13:10.090
- I want you to scare him.

13:10.090 --> 13:13.200
Make him realize
how serious perjury is.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.070
- Well, Helen,
if I represent this kid

13:16.070 --> 13:17.180
I'd be working for him,
not you.

13:17.180 --> 13:19.050
- I realize that.

13:19.050 --> 13:21.100
I just want him to hear
the legal consequences

13:21.100 --> 13:24.030
of recanting
from a defense attorney.

13:24.030 --> 13:26.200
His best interests
are also mine.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.230
- And you don't think
he's telling the truth now?

13:28.230 --> 13:31.000
- No way.
His story has been

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
completely consistent
up until now.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
His statement the police
and the preliminary testimony

13:36.000 --> 13:37.150
corroborate
the physical evidence.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.000
This case is tight.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.220
Will you, at least,
talk to him?

13:47.010 --> 13:48.100

been tampered with,

13:48.100 --> 13:50.030
no sign of break-ins
with the windows.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.010
- What about from above
the shower where the VCR was?

13:52.010 --> 13:53.100

13:53.100 --> 13:55.040
This was done
by somebody with access.

13:55.040 --> 13:58.070
You had any parties, Lucy?
Friends over?

13:58.070 --> 14:00.030

over sometimes but I--

14:00.030 --> 14:03.000

Celtic guy, basketball players,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.140

but, damn, I lost it.

14:26.070 --> 14:27.210

14:27.210 --> 14:29.140
- The Boston Buff society,

14:29.140 --> 14:31.210
They're basically retired people
who follow trials

14:31.210 --> 14:35.050

Here it is.

is now backing my client's story

15:05.170 --> 15:07.150
and Ms. Gamble's the only one
saying that he's guilty.

15:07.150 --> 15:09.060

out of some

15:09.060 --> 15:11.010
warped sense of loyalty
to his father.

15:11.010 --> 15:13.090

and, now, you've lost him.

15:13.090 --> 15:15.080
- Do you have
any additional witnesses?

15:15.080 --> 15:17.080
- I don't need any.
Gary Armbrust's testimony

15:17.080 --> 15:19.010

just like it did at the prelim.

15:19.010 --> 15:20.120
- Wait a minute,
what am I missing here?

15:20.120 --> 15:22.000
- If he takes the stand
and changes his story

15:22.000 --> 15:23.160
I will charge him
with perjury.

15:23.160 --> 15:26.080
- That is extortion!
- No, it's called leverage

15:26.080 --> 15:28.020
to protect against
witness manipulation.

15:28.020 --> 15:29.200
- The only one manipulating
here is you.

15:29.200 --> 15:32.200
- Look, you can cross the kid
however you want,

15:32.200 --> 15:34.160
but she can
certainly call him.

15:39.060 --> 15:41.080
- What if I just
plead the fifth?

15:41.080 --> 15:45.040
- Well, you can do that, but
it really won't help your dad.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.180
If you plead
the Fifth Amendment,

15:46.180 --> 15:49.030
it basically means
your testimony is unavailable.

15:49.030 --> 15:51.060
Which means the D.A.
can then introduce

15:51.060 --> 15:53.020
your testimony
from the prelim.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.080
- And you're saying
that if I change my story

15:55.080 --> 15:56.200
she could put me in jail?

15:56.200 --> 16:00.050
- It's a very real
possibility, yes.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.230
- What do you think
I should do?

16:06.230 --> 16:09.230
- Well, I would normally
advise you to tell the truth,

16:09.230 --> 16:11.110
but if the truth
is something different

16:11.110 --> 16:13.020
than what you said
at the prelim,

afraid of me than his father!

42:11.230 --> 42:13.160
- This is an over reaction--
- Life sentence, Gary!

42:13.160 --> 42:16.150
Go celebrate, Dad.

42:16.150 --> 42:18.140
- Is this true?

42:18.140 --> 42:21.000
Can I get life?

42:21.000 --> 42:22.200
Tell me!

42:22.200 --> 42:24.050
- Don't say anything to anybody.

42:24.050 --> 42:25.170
I'll be right back
to talk to you.

42:25.170 --> 42:27.160
- What the hell is going on?
