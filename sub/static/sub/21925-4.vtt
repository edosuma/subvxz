01:12.572 --> 01:14.824
The Federation ships are hiding.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.160
They pose no threat.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.954
Open your hearts to the one
who delivered this great day.

01:20.080 --> 01:24.042
T'Kuvma the Unforgettable!

10:18.117 --> 10:19.827
T'Kuvma, my lord,

10:20.494 --> 10:24.498
it has been six months since your ship
was disabled and the war began.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.463
We are left behind, in disrepair.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.424
Your followers are hungry.

10:33.507 --> 10:37.928
Help me guide them to nourishment.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.473
You are an artist now?

10:43.225 --> 10:45.478
This is the orbit of every object

10:45.561 --> 10:48.689
we have scavenged through
in the debris field.

10:49.815 --> 10:55.905
There are no Birds-of-Prey that we require
to restart our engines.

10:56.238 --> 10:59.367
-There is one ship.
-We will not have this discussion again--

10:59.533 --> 11:01.911
The  Shenzhou  is within range.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.746
It may have been abandoned,

11:03.829 --> 11:06.290
but it still has an intact
dilithium-processing unit.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.876
This is the very ship that felled T'Kuvma.

11:08.959 --> 11:12.046
To fuse its technology with our own
would be blasphemy.

11:12.129 --> 11:14.799
You had no such outrage
when we ate its captain.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.510
I saw your smile
when you picked the meat

11:17.593 --> 11:20.971
from her smooth skull.

11:21.305 --> 11:24.767
As T'Kuvma perished in my arms...

11:25.768 --> 11:29.397
I swore to keep his fire lit.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.400
To resist assimilation.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.111
To lead his followers.

11:35.236 --> 11:40.533
But now they slowly die of hunger
on this ghost ship.

11:40.616 --> 11:44.537
His legacy dies with them.

11:44.620 --> 11:45.746
I cannot allow it.

11:46.622 --> 11:48.541
What good is purity

11:48.707 --> 11:50.626
if it leads only to death?

11:54.880 --> 11:57.049
My father was T'Kuvma's blood kin,

11:57.967 --> 12:01.637
but my mother was House Mókai...

12:02.638 --> 12:06.684
the watcher clan, the deceivers,
the weavers of lies.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.479
When I was a child,

12:11.856 --> 12:13.399
she gave me a bat'leth

12:14.442 --> 12:17.695
and told me to cleave my own heart.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.323
To choose one house over the other.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.077
Instead...

12:26.036 --> 12:30.583
I built a bridge to serve both.

12:32.209 --> 12:36.172
Now it is your turn to build,

12:36.839 --> 12:39.341
to go into that graveyard

12:39.425 --> 12:43.179
and bring back
the  Shenzhou's  processing unit

12:43.763 --> 12:45.890
for the good of your people.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.267
You must go to that ship.

18:04.792 --> 18:05.793
Kol.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.172
What is the reason
for your welcome visit?

18:12.716 --> 18:14.843
The last time I was here,

18:14.927 --> 18:17.638
on the eve of the war,

18:18.180 --> 18:22.434
I hurled disrespect.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.978
Now I come with humility.

18:26.939 --> 18:30.984
T'Kuvma teaches that
in a united Klingon Empire,

18:31.819 --> 18:33.695
no one kneels but our foe.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.659
Wise words.

18:40.619 --> 18:44.289
But words don't win wars.

18:45.124 --> 18:51.004
Your house's ship
has what no one else has:

18:52.339 --> 18:54.842
cloaking technology

18:56.468 --> 18:58.137
that can crush Starfleet.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.098
We need you back in the fight.

19:01.431 --> 19:05.477
We have scavenged the dead vessels
floating around us in the graveyard

19:05.602 --> 19:07.396
left by our battle with Starfleet.

19:08.021 --> 19:12.109
Six months since that fight,
we are almost operational again.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.903
But we still lack a dilithium processor.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.573
We are almost out of food, too.

19:17.739 --> 19:21.493
But as T'Kuvma taught us...

19:22.786 --> 19:25.247
what belongs to House T'Kuvma...

19:27.499 --> 19:28.959
belongs to House Kor.

19:30.752 --> 19:34.590
May the words of your messiah,
our messiah,

19:35.007 --> 19:37.551
also sustain us.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.179
Remain Klingon!

19:40.596 --> 19:43.307
Remain Klingon!

27:10.086 --> 27:12.547
Atmosphere pressurization complete.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.316
L'Rell.

27:31.816 --> 27:35.528
There is nothing worth taking
on this deck,

27:35.612 --> 27:37.989
or in the captain's ready room.

27:38.698 --> 27:41.201
I have located the dilithium processor.

27:43.078 --> 27:46.039
The coupling unit is covered
in crystal residue.

27:47.123 --> 27:49.209
Unplugging the processor
could cause an explosion.

27:49.292 --> 27:52.420
One sudden move
and we join the Black Fleet.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.465
I will free it.

27:58.968 --> 28:02.389
L'Rell, we do not always view things
the same way...

28:03.515 --> 28:05.266
but I have come to know you

28:06.518 --> 28:07.894
as one who is astute.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.271
More astute than I.

28:11.689 --> 28:13.024
Thank you, my lord.

28:13.441 --> 28:15.318
Why do you call me that?

28:16.236 --> 28:18.071
T'Kuvma made you his successor.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.657
Surely you doubted his choice.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.076
T'Kuvma barely knew me,

28:23.159 --> 28:26.371
while you served at his side for years.

28:34.713 --> 28:38.383
T'Kuvma saw something in you.

28:40.218 --> 28:42.137
A purity of devotion.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.393
I do not want the mantle of leadership.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.397
Standing behind you, I am free to move.

28:52.772 --> 28:58.903
Able to be your enforcer,
defender, campaigner.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.582
I am fortunate to have you.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.670
Shall we uncouple?

29:34.397 --> 29:36.107
Thank T'Kuvma.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.860
With this, our ship will fly.

36:04.745 --> 36:05.788
What is this?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.710
Provisions. From my ship.

36:10.793 --> 36:12.712
I provided some,

36:12.795 --> 36:16.007
and your crew fell in line behind me.

36:16.132 --> 36:21.429
The price of loyalty is low
for those who are starving.

36:24.432 --> 36:25.850
You've failed.

36:26.100 --> 36:31.022
You are as useless as you are ugly,
son of none.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.523
T'Kuvma anointed me.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.026
I am the Torchbearer.

36:35.359 --> 36:38.905
And for that privilege,

36:39.614 --> 36:43.492
you allowed a human
to extinguish his light.

36:45.578 --> 36:48.164
The star of Kahless was lit by T'Kuvma.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.875
The great houses are now together as one.

36:50.958 --> 36:53.169
Only until we defeat the Federation.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.964
Then we will divide again.

37:00.426 --> 37:03.888
But your strange ship,

37:04.013 --> 37:06.432
her crew, and cloaking technology

37:06.599 --> 37:07.975
will now serve me.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.978
I would sooner die.

37:18.694 --> 37:20.613
It is yours, my lord.

37:38.756 --> 37:39.799
Kill him.

37:42.593 --> 37:45.471
I know a more fitting fate.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.977
Dump him in the grave of our enemy.

41:33.741 --> 41:35.284
T'Kuvma, my lord.

41:36.952 --> 41:40.164
They left me here to die

41:40.247 --> 41:43.542
in the nest of the vermin
who took your life.

41:44.126 --> 41:48.172
My faith tells me this is not the end.

41:55.804 --> 41:58.557
My faith tells me this is not the end!

41:59.600 --> 42:00.851
Voq.

42:06.565 --> 42:07.775
You renounced me.

42:07.942 --> 42:09.109
To save your life.

42:09.276 --> 42:11.946
It won't be long before Kol realizes
I'm gone.

42:22.331 --> 42:25.376
We need to go after them.
Make House T'Kuvma whole again.

42:25.584 --> 42:26.752
They belong to Kol.

42:27.586 --> 42:30.005
Now we must strategize
on a grander scale.

42:30.798 --> 42:35.678
In order to convince the 24 houses
to follow T'Kuvma's teachings,

42:36.262 --> 42:39.098
you must win this war.

42:39.557 --> 42:44.436
Prove to all you are
the one true Torchbearer.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.689
You speak as if you have a way.

42:47.273 --> 42:48.107
I do.

42:49.108 --> 42:52.403
I've stolen a raider, and will take you
to the home of the Mókai.

42:52.486 --> 42:54.697
I will leave you with the matriarchs,

42:54.780 --> 42:58.033
who will expose you to things
you never knew possible.

42:59.368 --> 43:01.745
But it comes at a cost.

43:11.755 --> 43:13.799
What must I sacrifice?

43:15.843 --> 43:17.094
Everything.
