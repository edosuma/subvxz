If I could revisit
any time in my life,

05:38.839 --> 05:41.089
it might surprise you.

09:06.838 --> 09:11.007
I just wanna say, bull,
that I honor you

09:11.051 --> 09:12.342
right now
with that performance.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.803
You stripped it all back,
and you just said,

09:14.805 --> 09:19.891
"I'm gonna let my voice
and my heart and my soul
just speak for itself."

09:19.893 --> 09:21.518
and thank you so much
for letting us in.

09:23.063 --> 09:29.392
Yes, I'm just blown away,
and I have no earthly idea
who you are.

09:29.403 --> 09:33.154
All right, so tonight
we're sending our
men in black back in time

09:33.198 --> 09:36.783
to retrieve an important item
from each singer's past.

09:36.827 --> 09:40.328
The journey back in time
will be no easy task
for the men in black.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.039
They'll be jostled through
space-time vortex.

09:43.083 --> 09:47.335
But we gotta get those clues.
Fire up the time machine.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.422
What's going on?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.136
Oh, my god.

09:56.138 --> 09:59.014
Nicole: Oh, my god.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.682
That's, like,
old-school macintosh.

10:00.726 --> 10:01.641
Robin: Yeah.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.352
This takes me back.
I loved this thing,

10:04.396 --> 10:08.857
but it made
the most annoying sound ever.

10:08.900 --> 10:12.444
- Ha-ha! Yes!
- ( dial-up tones )

10:12.487 --> 10:14.437
that's the modem!

10:14.439 --> 10:18.533
That sound will forever
live rent free in my head.

10:18.568 --> 10:21.953
Oh, snap. Rent free.

10:21.997 --> 10:27.250
Oh, my god. Taye diggs
was a star of "rent."

10:27.252 --> 10:32.339
outdated modem,
popular in the '90s,
just like "rent."

10:32.382 --> 10:36.885
and also last time there
was a scrubs in the clues
with a stethoscope.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.012
Taye diggs
was in "private practice."

10:39.047 --> 10:41.056
oh, yeah.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.099
That's a good one
right there, ken.

10:43.134 --> 10:44.809
Leslie,
what you picking up on?

10:44.853 --> 10:49.397
Well, I wanna say
cheyenne jackson,
who I work with.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.941
- Your costar on "call me kat."
- yes, on "call me kat."

10:51.943 --> 10:54.319
but if that's you,
I'm gonna come over there
and smack you

10:54.363 --> 10:56.363
because you should've told me.

10:56.406 --> 10:59.658
But, you know,
he too was on broadway.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.159
So talented.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.869
And he can do,
you know, anything.

11:02.913 --> 11:04.037
- Jenny: Yes.
- Ken: Yes.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.373
You know,
there was a nail in the clue.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.918
And this artist
sampled "nine inch nails"

11:09.961 --> 11:12.128
in "old town road."

11:12.172 --> 11:13.797
and we did see the drama mask,

11:13.840 --> 11:15.924
and we know
he's very theatrical.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.426
- Okay.
- Lil nas x!

11:18.470 --> 11:20.053
- Oh!
- Oh.

11:20.097 --> 11:23.807
The only thing is lil nas
is actually, like, 6'3".

11:23.850 --> 11:25.308
Aw, shut your face, robin.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.603

that stage is your home.

Leslie: Aw.

11:30.065 --> 11:33.024
Amazing job.
Y'all make some noise
for the bull.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.986

backstage, bull.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.363
Bully, bully!

11:40.283 --> 11:44.077

<i> when I first hit big.</i>

12:33.253 --> 12:35.962
<i> I was suddenly pulled</i>
<i> in a million directions.</i>

12:36.006 --> 12:37.714
- Wow.
- White hot fame.

12:37.758 --> 12:41.301
<i> There were interviews,</i>
<i> award shows, red carpets,</i>

12:41.344 --> 12:45.096
<i> but I think sometimes</i>
<i> you can get so caught up</i>
<i> in what's next</i>

12:45.140 --> 12:48.266
<i> that you're really living</i>
<i> in the what's now?</i>

12:48.310 --> 12:51.895
<i> And I wish that</i>
<i> I had enjoyed that time</i>
<i> for what it was,</i>

12:51.938 --> 12:55.190
<i> the beginning</i>
<i> of an amazing career.</i>

12:55.233 --> 12:58.026
I'm just trying to remember
that lesson here.

12:58.069 --> 13:01.404
<i>I actually signed on to do this</i>
<i> a few days before it started,</i>

13:01.448 --> 13:03.823
<i> so it's been that same</i>
<i> sort of whirlwind.</i>

13:03.867 --> 13:06.284
<i> I don't think people realize</i>
<i> all that goes into this.</i>

13:06.286 --> 13:08.745
<i> There's costume fittings,</i>
<i> music meetings.</i>

13:08.747 --> 13:11.080
But it's crazy,
because it all comes together.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.374
<i> And when it does, it's magic.</i>

13:13.376 --> 13:15.084
<i> I've always believed in magic.</i>

13:15.128 --> 13:17.086
I see myself a bit
of a wizard.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.129
Ken and robin:
Bit of a wizard.

13:18.173 --> 13:19.631
Someone from harry potter?

13:19.633 --> 13:21.549
And I'm trying to stay calm

What an amazing performance.

15:27.886 --> 15:30.053
Outstanding in every way.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.221
You picked it up,
just up tempo this week.

15:32.223 --> 15:35.058
Last time it was, like,
a ballad that put us,

15:35.101 --> 15:37.060
and nicole especially,
to tears.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.604
- It just shows
your versatility.
- Yeah.

15:39.648 --> 15:41.522
Ken: And honestly,
you're rapidly becoming
one of my favorites.

15:41.566 --> 15:45.068
- Amazing job.
- Ken!

15:46.196 --> 15:49.322
All right,
so we gotta get those clues.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.324
Fire up the time machine!

16:00.877 --> 16:04.003
- It's an ipod.
- All you have to do
is plug it in,

16:04.047 --> 16:06.172
and let's get
the party started!

16:06.216 --> 16:09.926
- Yeah!
-<i> ( music playing )</i>

16:11.137 --> 16:15.223
go, leslie. Go, leslie.
Go, leslie. Go, leslie.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.892
Robin: Oh, oh, oh, oh!

16:17.936 --> 16:20.395
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

16:21.856 --> 16:23.272
Nick: All right, guys.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.150
Does that help with any of
the clues on pepper's identity?

16:26.152 --> 16:30.154
Well, you guys, the audience,
you heard what she said, right?

16:30.198 --> 16:32.115
"get the party started."

16:32.158 --> 16:35.368
- who sang that song? Pink!
- Robin: Oh!

16:35.412 --> 16:37.912
She was an overnight success,
pulled in many
different directions.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.206
- Yes.
- She's got that amazing voice

16:40.250 --> 16:41.958
that can pull off
changing it up.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.126
Ken: Absolutely.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.253
- Nick: Pink pepper.
- That's a great guess.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.255
Yeah, I mean,
just from the ipod alone,

16:47.298 --> 16:51.009
you're thinking, like, a star
in the early to mid-aughts.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.177
- So, you have--
- the mid what?

16:53.221 --> 16:59.600
It is the decade
from 2000 to 2009.

16:59.644 --> 17:03.354
And I should know because
I'm a "doc-tor." now...

17:03.356 --> 17:04.981
Nicole: Wow.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.899
Something got to me
with the clue package

17:06.943 --> 17:09.861
making me think idina menzel.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.904
Because she was shot
out of a cannon,

17:11.948 --> 17:13.823
just lightning fast fame,

17:13.867 --> 17:15.783
- and he's been around
since the early aughts.
- After "frozen."

17:15.827 --> 17:19.412
- yes.
- Well, I am torn.

17:19.456 --> 17:22.957
- Like--
- natalie imbruglia.

17:25.295 --> 17:27.003
He just laid that one up
for me, didn't you?

17:27.047 --> 17:28.921
The way you said "torn,"
I was like, "oh."

17:28.965 --> 17:31.883
but this could very well be
ellie goulding.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.426
Possibly.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.136
- Very good guess.
- She had overnight success.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.262
Nice.

17:36.264 --> 17:38.264
- Same era.
- Yeah, full circle moment.

17:38.308 --> 17:42.226
I just wanna say fearless,
confident, born to be onstage.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.479
- That's all.
- Yeah!

17:44.481 --> 17:46.147
Incredible job, pepper.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.816
Now pop on backstage.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.401
Good job.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.321

in somebody's fajita.

17:53.364 --> 17:56.824
Hi, pepper.
Congratulations on tonight.

17:56.868 --> 17:59.410
You're gonna be amazing,
and I can't wait for everyone
to see you.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.136

biggest regrets.

18:23.228 --> 18:28.189

what life would be like

18:28.233 --> 18:30.233
<i> probably more than</i>
<i> the average person,</i>

20:58.883 --> 21:01.050
- Nicole: Wow.
- As we know, teena marie,

21:01.094 --> 21:02.260
one of the best vocalists
in the game.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.886
Oh, man. Incredible.

21:04.347 --> 21:09.600
And for someone like skunk
to be able to just easily hit
them teena marie runs was--

21:09.602 --> 21:12.103
we bow down again.

21:12.105 --> 21:15.439
I mean, I certainly
didn't need all this hairspray
to take me back to the '80s,

21:15.474 --> 21:18.359
'cause that was
a perfect choice,

21:18.403 --> 21:21.153
and the way you sang it
was epic.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.197
Well, I'm the new guy,

21:23.241 --> 21:26.158
and I'm just--
I can't even speak,
you know what I mean?

21:26.202 --> 21:28.369
It was so wonderful.

21:28.413 --> 21:30.621
I gotta sit down.
I gotta sit down.

21:30.665 --> 21:33.791
- Jenny: You're skunked out.
- Nicole: Yeah.

fire up the time machine.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.466

21:52.478 --> 21:55.479
It's really switching up his
molecules, boy, I tell you.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.357
( beeping )

21:58.359 --> 21:59.567
what is that?

21:59.610 --> 22:00.985
Nick: Pagers.

22:01.029 --> 22:02.903
Jenny: I was gonna say
it's a beeper.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.613
- Yeah, a beeper, pagers.
- Beeper, pager.

22:04.657 --> 22:09.118
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- If someone sent me
these three digits,

22:09.120 --> 22:12.913
it would make me feel
like a complete dream girl.

22:12.957 --> 22:14.206
- What?
- Ah.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.125
- Three digits?
- Complete dream girl.

22:16.127 --> 22:18.669
- 607.
- 607.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.838
I remember when you used
to page, like, "143,"

22:20.882 --> 22:22.131
that meant,
like, "I love you."

22:22.175 --> 22:24.383
yeah, I think 607 meant
"I miss you."

22:24.427 --> 22:25.843
nick: Oh, okay.

22:25.887 --> 22:27.011
Jenny: Well,
if we're talking dream girl,
you know,

22:27.055 --> 22:29.180
the way she performs
week after week,

22:29.215 --> 22:32.683
I feel like this really
could be jennifer hudson.

22:32.727 --> 22:35.686
So I'm gonna go the other side
of that-- cynthia erivo.

22:35.730 --> 22:39.023
I just saw cynthia erivo
the other night
at the hollywood bowl,

22:39.067 --> 22:42.443
and she actually wrote
this song for her father,

22:42.487 --> 22:44.987
and it had the entire
hollywood bowl in tears.

22:45.031 --> 22:48.240
And for me, that resonates
with this story.

22:48.284 --> 22:51.327
- Mmm. That's good.
- Nick: All right.

22:51.371 --> 22:54.288
Yeah, tonight I see
these clues

22:54.332 --> 22:55.831
about not getting
a chance to say goodbye

22:55.875 --> 23:00.920
to somebody that you loved,
and then I see the 1994 pager

23:00.963 --> 23:03.172
and the message being
"I miss you."

23:03.174 --> 23:07.385
I think the person that
you didn't get to say goodbye to
was the notorious b.I.G.,

23:07.387 --> 23:11.097
and I think that "I miss you"
was the song that you sang

23:11.140 --> 23:14.258
with diddy called
"I'll be missing you."

23:14.268 --> 23:16.352
- oh, that song.
- I think this is faith evans.

23:16.396 --> 23:20.231
Oh, I got the chills!
Look it, I have chills
from your guess.

23:20.274 --> 23:22.233

how I feel about you.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.527
You're always crushing it,
always killing it.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.028
You changed it up tonight.

- Thank you for sharing
your heart with us.
- Yeah.

23:28.866 --> 23:33.244
Such a powerful
performance from the skunk,
once again taking us back.

and crawl on backstage.

23:41.963 --> 23:45.423
I hope my performance
is good enough to get me
into the semi-finals.

I can't even bear it.

35:18.242 --> 35:20.200
Wow, he's starting to look
like an emoji.

35:22.329 --> 35:26.123
( rasping )
this is pure style.

35:27.209 --> 35:29.292
- Pure "style-a."
- yeah, he's creepy.

35:29.336 --> 35:31.253
- Ken: I mean...
- Robin: Yeah.

35:31.296 --> 35:34.089
The jacket reminds me
of twisted sister,

35:34.133 --> 35:36.842
like dee snider.

35:36.885 --> 35:38.093
Jenny: Ooh, I like that.

35:38.428 --> 35:41.555
You know, tiktok has, like,
a celebrity who you look like,

35:41.598 --> 35:43.598
and I came up as dee snider.

35:45.769 --> 35:48.353
But it does sound like him.
All the clues point to him.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.480
Is this real?
Do you have a big belly really?

35:50.482 --> 35:51.857
Jenny: We never know.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.692
Boo!

35:53.694 --> 35:56.153
- Are you okay, nick?
Nick, are you okay?
- Oh, my gosh.

35:56.196 --> 35:57.279
- I'm all right.
- Ken: Okay.

35:57.281 --> 36:00.407
This is hard.
I think it's a comedian.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.118
I definitely
get english vibes.

36:03.162 --> 36:05.620
- From England, like--
- like a british comedic actor?

36:05.664 --> 36:07.414
- Yeah.
- You think, like,
a russell brand?

36:07.416 --> 36:10.375
- I mean, he's a little taller.
- No, he's tall and skinny.

36:10.419 --> 36:14.254
- Like,
a ricky gervais type maybe?
- Yeah, ricky! Ricky!

36:14.298 --> 36:16.882
Ken: It could be
a comedian, yes.

36:16.925 --> 36:19.134
I was thinking that
watching the story package,

36:19.178 --> 36:20.760
but based on that performance,

36:20.804 --> 36:23.346
that can't be anyone
other than a rocker.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.682
He's got the roger daltrey
from the who kind of vibe.

36:25.726 --> 36:30.020
- That's what I thought.
- One of the most iconic
rock bands ever.

36:30.022 --> 36:34.816
Honestly, jester,
you, sir, are the wildest

36:34.860 --> 36:40.155
of all wild cards,
and we thank you.

36:40.157 --> 36:44.651
Y'all make some noise one more
time for the wild card, jester.

36:44.661 --> 36:49.414
I mean, can we just
talk about the amazing group
of wild cards we've had?

36:49.416 --> 36:52.459
- The best we've ever had.
- Unbelievable.

No!

37:18.445 --> 37:22.530
Nick: And the singer
headed home right now...

37:22.574 --> 37:23.615
Oh.

37:23.617 --> 37:25.116
Is...

37:33.585 --> 37:35.961
Aww!

37:37.547 --> 37:39.089
Leslie: I can't take it.

37:41.134 --> 37:43.134
- Hamster.
- Oh, no!

37:43.136 --> 37:47.055
- What?
- Nick: Aww, we love
the hamster.

37:47.099 --> 37:49.432
The competition
was so close this week.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.017
He's my favorite.

37:51.061 --> 37:53.979
Nick: Well, congratulations
to the rest of you.

37:53.981 --> 37:56.231
We'll see you for
our group a semi-finals.

37:56.275 --> 37:57.649
That's a disappointment.

37:57.693 --> 38:00.860
But we gonna keep it going
for the hamster, y'all.

38:00.904 --> 38:03.029
Whoo! Hamster, we love you!

38:03.073 --> 38:06.825
Nick:
Hamster, hamster, hamster!

38:06.868 --> 38:08.827
All:
Hamster, hamster, hamster.

38:08.870 --> 38:12.163
Hey, hey, hey!
And he's still peeing on me!

38:13.166 --> 38:14.916
We hate to see you leave,
hamster.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.793
- Jenny: I know.
- Aww.

38:16.795 --> 38:20.130
But we are happy we get to see
who you actually are.

38:20.173 --> 38:21.631
But before we reveal that,

38:21.675 --> 38:25.260
men in black, bring out
our first impression guesses.

38:29.641 --> 38:32.017
And a reminder, ken is still
in the lead with one point.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.144
- Oh, don't rub it in.
- Yes!

38:34.146 --> 38:37.147
Okay, that's not bad.

38:37.149 --> 38:40.859
- Robin, you said
cheech marin.
- Yes.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.819
Cheech and chong.
You sticking with it?

38:42.863 --> 38:44.988
In the first clue package,
they showed san francisco.

38:45.032 --> 38:47.282
Cheech is famously
from san francisco,

38:47.284 --> 38:50.952
and we had tommy chong
on one of our early seasons.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.288
- I'm sticking with it.
- Great guess.

38:53.332 --> 38:55.999
- Some comedic greats. Jenny?
- Yes?

38:56.001 --> 38:58.918
You're supposed
to only use one name.

38:58.953 --> 39:04.632
You chose andy richter
or jason alexander.

39:04.676 --> 39:09.095
- You did "or."
- I am not going to stick
with either of those.

39:09.097 --> 39:13.266
In the clue package
there was a calendar.
Saturday was circled.

39:13.310 --> 39:16.394
So that emphasizes
that "snl,"

39:16.438 --> 39:18.146
so I think
this is rob schneider.

39:18.190 --> 39:22.609
From "Saturday night live."
jenny sounds pretty confident.

39:22.652 --> 39:26.029
Nicole, you chose
jason alexander as well.

39:26.073 --> 39:30.950
- Ken: Oh, wow.
- Yes, I did, nick.

39:30.994 --> 39:33.161
I did, and I'm not
gonna stick with it.

39:33.205 --> 39:37.791
I think this is an iglesias,

39:37.834 --> 39:42.295
but only one of them is fluffy.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.297
So I'm going with
gabriel iglesias.
Come on, fluffy!

39:44.341 --> 39:45.590
Let's go!

39:47.386 --> 39:50.053
- Now, mr. Leslie jordan...
- Yes, sir.

39:50.097 --> 39:52.222
Who is this?

39:52.224 --> 39:53.264
Fluffy.

39:53.266 --> 39:56.059
Come on, leslie!
Let's go!

39:56.103 --> 39:57.685
It's gabriel iglesias?

39:57.729 --> 40:00.980
Yes, I feel--
it's like it just came to me.

40:01.024 --> 40:02.482
- It's a feeling.
- It's a feeling.

40:02.484 --> 40:03.942
Nick: There it is.

40:03.985 --> 40:07.862
Dr. Ken jeong,
you chose bill murray.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.407
- Ken: Oh.
- Are you sticking with that?

40:10.450 --> 40:11.950
Ken: I am not.

40:11.993 --> 40:13.827
I believe the latin clues

40:13.870 --> 40:16.162
reminded me of the star
of one my favorite movies,

40:16.206 --> 40:17.956
"casa de mi padre,"

40:17.999 --> 40:21.126
so I think
this is will ferrell.

40:21.169 --> 40:23.962
- Jenny: Oh, yeah.
- Oh, that's a good guess.

40:24.005 --> 40:27.006
You guys ready to find out
if they're right or not?

40:27.050 --> 40:28.216
- Yeah!
- Yes!

40:28.260 --> 40:30.885
Let's see if any of you
are even close.

40:30.887 --> 40:33.388
I will no longer get peed on.

40:34.224 --> 40:35.265

41:30.480 --> 41:32.322
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Indeed.

41:32.365 --> 41:34.574

"I'm gonna take my nut bag
