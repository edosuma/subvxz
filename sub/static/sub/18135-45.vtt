WEBVTT

00:24.625 --> 00:26.794
BATMAN:  Batman
to Green Lantern, report.

00:26.827 --> 00:29.130
Hal, do you copy?

00:29.163 --> 00:31.665
Yeah, yeah, I...
I read you, Bats. What's up?

00:31.699 --> 00:34.268
BATMAN: I'm bringing in
Kanjar-Ro and his gang.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.670
You took a few good hits
in the battle.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.439
Sure you're okay?

00:38.472 --> 00:40.141
What?
Are you kidding?

00:40.174 --> 00:41.175
Good to go.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.643
BATMAN: Glad to hear it.

00:42.676 --> 00:45.346
Can't look like
a lightweight
in front of Batman.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.148
Just need to get
my head together.

00:48.349 --> 00:49.283
A-ha!

00:49.317 --> 00:52.186
Good timing, Robogas.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.688
Best automated refueling
station in the quadrant.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.261
And second cleanest bathrooms.

01:02.163 --> 01:05.099
GREEN LANTERN: Uh,
eenie, meenie...

01:05.499 --> 01:06.567
This one.

01:20.481 --> 01:21.515
Ah!

01:22.250 --> 01:24.485
Ah! Okay.

01:24.518 --> 01:25.653
That is better.

01:29.523 --> 01:30.858
What? Ow!

01:32.593 --> 01:35.529
ALIEN: Hmm.
LOBO: Mmm

01:37.731 --> 01:40.568
Looks like I might've forgot
to put the power ring back on.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.102
Oopsie.

01:42.136 --> 01:45.673
Good thing Batman insists
I wear this dumb
emergency life-support belt...

01:47.408 --> 01:50.544
...which I probably should've
charged at some point, ever.

01:52.313 --> 01:56.650
Come to me,
power ring of Sector 2814.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.823
Anytime now.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.426
No, no, no, no, no! Gone.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.295
Okay, don't panic, Hal.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.663
I'm sure some good Samaritan
dropped it in
the lost and fou...

02:12.266 --> 02:13.834
Agh! Lobo.

02:15.769 --> 02:16.770
Ah!

02:19.673 --> 02:21.542
-Follow that Spacehog.

02:21.575 --> 02:22.810
You've got it, Mr. Jordan.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.820
Can't this bucket
go any faster?

02:32.853 --> 02:34.855
I'm exceeding
the space speed limit already.

02:34.888 --> 02:37.958
Perhaps we could contact
a nearby Justice Leaguer.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.560
No, no, no, no.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.562
How do you think
that conversation goes?

02:41.595 --> 02:44.765
"You left the most powerful
weapon in the quadrant
in a gas station loo?"

02:44.798 --> 02:47.868
"Loo"? "Loo" doesn't
sound very Batman.

02:47.901 --> 02:53.207
Oh, whoa. Do you think
he calls it the bat-room,
because of the...

02:53.241 --> 02:54.942
Oh, I just remembered.

02:54.975 --> 03:00.314
I got an automatic upload
of a galactic positioning
system or "GPS."

03:00.348 --> 03:02.783
It's a real firecracker.
Here, watch.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.787
NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM:
How may I be of assistance?

03:06.820 --> 03:11.725
Extrapolate Lobo's destination
and plot an intercept course.

03:11.759 --> 03:12.926
It works really fast...

03:12.960 --> 03:14.027
NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM: Plotted.

03:14.061 --> 03:17.331
Lobo's intercept
coordinates initiated.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.773
Here goes nothing.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.946
Nailed it.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.749
All right, Lobo.
Cough up that power ring.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.652
Ooh! I don't know what
you're talking about, Greenie.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.689
But you just scuffed
the main man's hog.

03:45.393 --> 03:49.530
You listen to me,
you dirty low-down
stinking Czarnian garbage.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.998
You're gonna give me that ring

03:51.031 --> 03:54.768
or I'm going to take
you apart piece
by filthy rotten piece.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.544
You tired yet, sport?

04:03.577 --> 04:05.479
Hey, listen, Lobo.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.548
In the heat of the moment,
things were said.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.484
I probably crossed
the line with that
"Czarnian garbage" comment.

04:10.518 --> 04:14.054
I guess sometimes words
hurt more than punches.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.457
How about we test that theory?

04:20.661 --> 04:24.031
Pull up! Pull up,
you bike-stealin' space cop.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.667
Since you asked so nicely...

04:29.970 --> 04:32.406
Feeling
a mite heavy.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.808
-You're tough,
but I'm a test pilot.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.611
I can take 15 Gs
during breakfast...

04:37.645 --> 04:40.414
-...while most punks...

04:40.448 --> 04:41.949
-...will pass out.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.718
Now, come to me...

04:44.752 --> 04:46.920
...power ring of Sector 2814.

04:53.894 --> 04:54.995
Oh, boy.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.698
You were right
about Lobo, Hal.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.667
He's wanted
for multiple offenses,

04:59.700 --> 05:01.034
but why not bring
him in yourself?

05:01.068 --> 05:03.937
HAL:
What, Bat... Bat...

05:03.971 --> 05:06.374
...breaking up.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.476
And out.
Who'd have guessed it?

05:08.509 --> 05:09.810
Lobo was telling the truth.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.779
Well, you can never
judge by appearances.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.547
My granny used to say that.

05:13.581 --> 05:16.650
Hey, maybe you never
put the ring on
in the first place.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.852
I sometimes forget
to put on my watch.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.754
I had it, okay?

05:20.788 --> 05:22.656
It must be at
the refueling station.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.991
But there was nobody...

05:26.460 --> 05:27.795
Alien momma!

05:27.828 --> 05:29.129
Great band!

05:29.162 --> 05:31.499
You've got to get us
back to the station
as fast as possible.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.333
There's a chance
she's still there.

05:33.367 --> 05:36.370
NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM:
Fastest route possible will
require unadvised paths to...

05:36.404 --> 05:38.372
As fast as possible!

05:38.406 --> 05:42.009
Initiating unadvised course
through unstable worm hole.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.511
BOTH: What

05:54.522 --> 05:59.660
Mustn't do that again.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.630
Agreed.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.498
Trouble breathing.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.034
Thanks, Cabbie.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.135
CABBIE: No prob.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.173
My ring! Lady!

06:13.206 --> 06:16.877
Hey, lady! Your baby,
in his mouth, choking hazard!

06:19.813 --> 06:21.048
Oh! No, no, no, no.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.183
Don't worry.
I'll get it out of there.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.952
You're going to be fine.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.020
-HAL: Everything is
going to be fine.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.858
Whoa!

06:39.633 --> 06:41.669
Hey, Green Lantern,
guess what?

06:41.702 --> 06:45.973
My new app says
that's not an alien momma
and her baby at all.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.609
It's a two-headed Babajorian.

06:48.642 --> 06:54.047
Evidently, their upper head
acts as some kind of
natural defense mechanism.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.115
You think?

06:55.148 --> 06:56.784
Don't panic.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.754
Ah!

07:00.788 --> 07:04.191
If I had my ring,
I'd at least know what he,
or she, is saying.

07:04.224 --> 07:08.228
NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM:
The Babajorian is using strong
profanity to express outrage

07:08.261 --> 07:12.600
over your, quote, "sticking
your repulsive
human hand down my throat."

07:12.633 --> 07:15.035
Okay, please apologize
in Babajorian

07:15.068 --> 07:17.137
-and explain that
I was trying to save...
-No, no!

07:17.170 --> 07:19.907
No, no. Tell it that the
Green Lantern attacked it

07:19.940 --> 07:22.476
because it was clearly
the deadliest warrior present

07:22.510 --> 07:25.713
but proved no match
for its deadly power.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.215
(NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM
SPEAKING BABAJORIAN)

07:31.251 --> 07:32.486
What just happened?

07:32.520 --> 07:34.021
Right, don't just stand there.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.023
-CABBIE: Go prostate yourself
before her.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.059
That the Babajorians
are a warrior race
who never give up.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.862
She'll keep fighting till
this asteroid is dust.

07:52.540 --> 07:56.143
Wait, if you didn't have
my ring
and Lobo didn't have it...

08:02.249 --> 08:03.617
A-ha!

08:03.651 --> 08:04.952
It was here all the time.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.689
That life-support belt
is on its last legs, G.L.

08:08.722 --> 08:11.825
It doesn't matter.
Once I fish my ring
out of that drain, I'll...

08:11.859 --> 08:14.728
What is that?

08:17.330 --> 08:19.733
HAL: It's a hairball.

08:20.734 --> 08:21.835
I used to have a cat.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.639
But it's alive and growing.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.008
HAL: I've seen a lot of
strange things in this galaxy.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.978
A lifeform descended
from hairballs?
Not that weird.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.246
CABBIE:
But it's glowing green.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.248
Well, weird that
this creature
was living in the drain

08:35.282 --> 08:37.751
and was infected by
the green energy
of my power ring...

08:37.785 --> 08:39.820
It looks mad.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.089
Uh, it's still growing.
You've got to stop him.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.592
(LIFE SUPPORT BELT
CHARGE DRAINS)

08:44.625 --> 08:46.960
I've got to get to my ring.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.929
It's attacking. Here!

08:50.197 --> 08:51.064
Wait a minute.

08:51.098 --> 08:54.034
I've been judging
by appearances all day.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.303
Need to start looking
beyond the surface.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.873
You're scared,
aren't you, pal?

09:00.774 --> 09:03.276
Overwhelmed by this new world?

09:03.310 --> 09:06.980
It's okay.
Everything's going to be fine.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.554
And... There you are.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.025
Better.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.993
Ah, what just happened?

09:20.027 --> 09:22.630
Put yourself in
this poor little guy's shoes.

09:22.663 --> 09:27.134
Suddenly in a world
it doesn't understand,
it's terrified.

09:27.167 --> 09:30.570
There you go, little buddy.
Home again. Home again.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.980
So, what do I owe you?

09:40.013 --> 09:42.349
On the house, G.L.

09:42.382 --> 09:45.218
You preserved the legacy
of Granny Cabbie.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.187
Can I give you
a lift anywhere?

09:47.220 --> 09:48.221
No thanks, pal.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.991
Right now,
I'm in the mood to fly.

09:53.861 --> 09:58.065
NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM:
That passenger. There was
something familiar about him.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.833
The Green Lantern?

09:59.867 --> 10:02.936
That's a strange thing
for a navigational app
to say, GPS.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.105
I'm not a navigational app.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.941
I'm a disembodied
artificial intelligence

10:07.975 --> 10:10.243
with no memory of my origin.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.846
That's okay.
We make a great team.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.715
You can stay here
in my cab forever.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.985
Negative. I feel compelled
to search for something

10:18.018 --> 10:19.152
or someone.

10:19.186 --> 10:22.289
That Green Lantern did not
give up hope...

10:23.023 --> 10:24.892
But...

10:24.925 --> 10:26.960
...and neither shall I.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.231
Well, that was weird.

10:33.867 --> 10:37.037
Green Lantern to Batman.
Heading back
to the Watchtower.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.238
Rendezvous with you there.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.707
BATMAN:
You all right, Lantern?

10:39.740 --> 10:41.308
Never better. Why do you ask?

10:41.341 --> 10:42.943
Because Lobo here
said something

10:42.976 --> 10:46.113
about you leaving
the most powerful weapon
in the quadrant

10:46.146 --> 10:48.782
in a refueling
station bathroom.

10:48.816 --> 10:54.121
Sorry, Batman.
Interference. Bat...

10:54.154 --> 10:56.056
I'm never gonna
live this down.
