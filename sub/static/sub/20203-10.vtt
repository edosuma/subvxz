00:05.306 --> 00:07.108
Hugh Hefner invites you

00:07.108 --> 00:11.045
to Playboy's roller disco
and pajama party!

00:11.045 --> 00:12.446
**

00:12.446 --> 00:14.582
* Let your body go *

00:14.582 --> 00:16.517
* You know you can do it *

00:16.517 --> 00:18.352
* Like eenie
meenie meinie mo *

00:18.352 --> 00:20.821
* There's really
nothing to it *

00:20.821 --> 00:22.556
* You can do it *

00:22.556 --> 00:24.958
The 1970s had been
a whirlwind.

00:24.958 --> 00:28.596
* Do it, just go ahead
and do your dance *

00:28.596 --> 00:30.498
By the end of the decade,

00:30.498 --> 00:32.766
Playboy operated
over 30 properties

00:32.766 --> 00:34.602
in six countries
across the world.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.837
* Just go ahead
and do your dance *

00:36.837 --> 00:39.173
* Get up
and do your thing *

00:39.173 --> 00:41.275
And with the center
of the Playboy empire

00:41.275 --> 00:43.277
now in Los Angeles,

00:43.277 --> 00:45.413
we were throwing
more parties than ever.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.715
* Get up and do
your thing *

00:47.715 --> 00:49.783
As we moved into
the 1980s, there was

00:49.783 --> 00:52.753
even more excitement
to look forward to.

00:52.753 --> 00:57.391
Space Shuttle Columbia
became the first mission

00:57.391 --> 00:59.327
of the long-awaited
space shuttle program.

00:59.327 --> 01:00.761
And liftoff.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.196
**

01:02.196 --> 01:03.397
And the world
of television

01:03.397 --> 01:04.698
was forever changed

01:04.698 --> 01:06.767
with the introduction
of MTV.

01:06.767 --> 01:10.204
**

01:10.204 --> 01:11.672
As for Playboy,

01:11.672 --> 01:13.874
after a rough patch
in the '70s,

01:13.874 --> 01:16.377
when circulation
numbers were down

01:16.377 --> 01:18.612
and ad revenues declined,

01:18.612 --> 01:20.748
we still had
a steady readership

01:20.748 --> 01:23.517
of 4.5 million people
each month.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.686
**

01:25.686 --> 01:28.989
Our first London Playboy
Club was so popular

01:28.989 --> 01:31.892
that we'd opened four more
casinos across England.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.395
Playboy's gambling
turnover in this country

01:34.395 --> 01:36.063
amounts,
in the past five years,

01:36.063 --> 01:38.999
to something
over £660 million,

01:38.999 --> 01:42.303
a great proportion
of Playboy's profits.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.972
And no one was
enjoying our success

01:44.972 --> 01:46.940
more than the man
running our UK operation,

01:46.940 --> 01:49.810
Victor Lownes.

01:49.810 --> 01:50.611
* I'm a man *

01:50.611 --> 01:51.812
* I'm a goddess *

01:51.812 --> 01:53.414
* I'm a man *

01:53.414 --> 01:55.316
What's you're salary now?

01:55.316 --> 02:00.188
Oh, about £300,000 a year.
It's quite high.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.589
**

02:01.589 --> 02:03.491
After a decade in England,

02:03.491 --> 02:07.195
Victor even had his own
42-room mansion that he shared

02:07.195 --> 02:10.464
with Playmate-turned-
girlfriend Marilyn Cole,

02:10.464 --> 02:12.900
and the two were
fitting right in

02:12.900 --> 02:14.802
with London's
high society.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.604
Victor Lownes has
a lot of charisma.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.939
He was riding horses
with Prince Charles

02:18.939 --> 02:21.742
and going on foxhunts
with the English aristocracy.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.211
**

02:23.211 --> 02:24.878
With his casinos
outperforming

02:24.878 --> 02:26.414
longtime British
gambling companies,

02:26.414 --> 02:28.616
it seemed like nothing
could stop Victor

02:28.616 --> 02:31.852
and the UK operation's
success.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.755
Yes, it's a very
profitable operation.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.024
I've had many days
here when we've won

02:37.024 --> 02:39.627
as much money as we've
paid for the place.

02:39.627 --> 02:42.530
But we were
about to find out

02:42.530 --> 02:44.832
that being
the biggest game in town

02:44.832 --> 02:48.802
also made you
the biggest target.

02:48.802 --> 02:52.673
* Every little movement *

02:52.673 --> 02:57.144
* Every little thing
you do *

02:57.144 --> 02:59.613
* Is it sleight of hand *

02:59.613 --> 03:04.618
* That commands my heart
to love you? *

03:04.618 --> 03:08.622
* Every little movement *

03:08.622 --> 03:12.226
* Every
little movement **

03:12.226 --> 03:14.495
**

03:15.963 --> 03:20.601
**

03:20.601 --> 03:23.036
For nearly 15 years,

03:23.036 --> 03:25.506
the Playboy operation
in England

03:25.506 --> 03:27.308
achieved
unparalleled success...

03:27.308 --> 03:30.110
**

03:30.110 --> 03:34.915
...but all that changed
on February 20th, 1981.

03:37.318 --> 03:40.888
Playboy are accused of
violating the gaming laws.

03:40.888 --> 03:44.692
Police raided
its Park Lane offices.

03:44.692 --> 03:48.429
The description by the
Westminster magistrates,

03:48.429 --> 03:49.830
Playboy is not
fit and proper

03:49.830 --> 03:51.365
to run
a casino operation.

03:56.169 --> 03:59.373
The London police staged
a simultaneous raid

03:59.373 --> 04:01.542
on all of our casinos.

04:04.712 --> 04:07.481
Turns out, our success
was not sitting well

04:07.481 --> 04:10.784
with some of
our competitors.

04:10.784 --> 04:13.821
They began making claims
of illegal operations

04:13.821 --> 04:17.157
at our London club,
prompting charges

04:17.157 --> 04:20.594
that we'd violated a number
of English gaming laws.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.263
Our staff
was interrogated,

04:23.263 --> 04:26.233
boxes of files
were seized,

04:26.233 --> 04:30.338
all in an effort to dig up
dirt on our operations.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.673
Other casinos
were under scrutiny

04:32.673 --> 04:34.842
and eventually,
so was Playboy.

04:34.842 --> 04:39.012
Playboy was accused of
some improprieties.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.214
It's questionable whether
that was actually happening.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.616
Lownes claimed they were not.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.219
Lownes had always
wanted his clubs

04:46.219 --> 04:47.988
to be a model of integrity.

04:47.988 --> 04:53.827
Today is not the end of
Playboy, but it could well be

04:53.827 --> 04:55.696
the beginning of the end.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.703
The casinos were raided.

05:02.703 --> 05:05.072
Employees questioned.
Files seized.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.073
When did this happen?

05:06.073 --> 05:07.074
Yesterday.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.342
I don't understand.

05:08.342 --> 05:09.943
Well, I don't have
specifics yet,

05:09.943 --> 05:12.480
but from what I'm hearing,
the allegations are serious,

05:12.480 --> 05:15.082
like enough to lose us
our gaming licenses.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.083
What?

05:16.083 --> 05:17.150
Holy shit.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.486
Exactly.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.488
No. There is no way
Victor is involved

05:20.488 --> 05:21.555
in anything illegal.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.691
Hef, I appreciate
your loyalty,

05:23.691 --> 05:25.092
but until
we have the facts...

05:25.092 --> 05:26.293
What did he say?

05:26.293 --> 05:27.961
I haven't heard from him.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.731
A friend of mine from
The London Times called me.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.033
Apparently, it's all
over the newspapers.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.736
The first thing he should
have done was call me,

05:35.736 --> 05:38.005
but King Victor
answers to no one,

05:38.005 --> 05:39.973
and now we have a goddamn
shit storm on our hands.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.642
He will answer to me.
Forget the phone.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.511
Get him here. Now.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.514
My pleasure.

05:52.886 --> 05:58.526
Because of the structure
of the British oversight

05:58.526 --> 06:01.762
and to some extent
because Victor liked to

06:01.762 --> 06:04.031
keep information
close to the vest,

06:04.031 --> 06:07.735
the American executives
were less aware

06:07.735 --> 06:13.106
of the details of the business
than they might have liked.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.808
I'd given Vic
a lot of freedom

06:14.808 --> 06:16.410
to run
the London operation

06:16.410 --> 06:18.912
and I'd always
trusted his decisions,

06:18.912 --> 06:20.681
but with the London casino

06:20.681 --> 06:24.051
responsible for
85% of our profits,

06:24.051 --> 06:26.286
we needed to resolve
this issue

06:26.286 --> 06:28.789
as quickly as possible,

06:28.789 --> 06:31.759
especially with a whole
new gambling operation

06:31.759 --> 06:34.828
starting up
in Atlantic City.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.030
Ethel, there's something
out there in the water.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.766
Harry, there's
nothing out there.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.367
Then what's rising
out of the sea, huh?

06:40.367 --> 06:41.935
Oh, that!

06:41.935 --> 06:43.437
That's the new Playboy
Hotel and Casino.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.872
What?

06:44.872 --> 06:46.974
Oh, Harry, it's
the dawn of a new era

06:46.974 --> 06:49.109
for the Playboy
Hotel and Casino,

06:49.109 --> 06:52.012
with their fantastic,
new salon privé.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.947
They wait on you
hand and foot.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.684
Ethel, why is it
rising out of the sea?

06:56.684 --> 06:59.453
Oh, Harry,
it's show business.

06:59.453 --> 07:03.957
The new, very civilized,
Playboy Hotel and Casino.

07:03.957 --> 07:07.528
**

07:07.528 --> 07:11.565
Atlantic City is already
a new gambling mecca,

07:11.565 --> 07:15.469
America's new Las Vegas.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.204
Three years earlier,

07:17.204 --> 07:19.206
Victor had
begun construction

07:19.206 --> 07:22.109
on a state-of-the-art
casino in Atlantic City.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.344
Despite the legal wrangle
in London,

07:24.344 --> 07:25.813
the Playboy Club is alive

07:25.813 --> 07:28.882
and profitable
in Atlantic City.

07:28.882 --> 07:33.353
We had invested $30
million in the project,

07:33.353 --> 07:36.490
and after obtaining a
temporary operating permit,

07:36.490 --> 07:39.092
the Playboy
Hotel and Casino

07:39.092 --> 07:41.061
was open for business
while we awaited

07:41.061 --> 07:43.263
final approval from
the gaming commission.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.431
* Oh *

07:44.431 --> 07:46.033
* Do you want to dance? *

07:46.033 --> 07:47.200
**

07:47.200 --> 07:48.802
Atlantic City
was a great opportunity

07:48.802 --> 07:51.672
to import Playboy style
and glamour

07:51.672 --> 07:52.773
into the casino business,

07:52.773 --> 07:54.074
which is something
that they had

07:54.074 --> 07:56.577
successfully been able
to accomplish in London.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.946
That was a formula
for success.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.714
With so much riding

08:00.714 --> 08:02.783
on our new casino
in Atlantic City,

08:02.783 --> 08:04.484
I needed
to feel confident

08:04.484 --> 08:05.753
that the situation
in London

08:05.753 --> 08:07.521
was under control.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.725
Vic, I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.493
Oh, no problem, buddy.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.828
Where's Daniels?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.630
Getting the noose
ready somewhere?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.599
This isn't about
your issues with Derick.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.800
I don't have issues
with Derick.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.135
I have an issue.
He wants my job.

08:22.135 --> 08:25.606
He is the president
of the company.

08:25.606 --> 08:29.309
And I answer
to the real boss.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.444
Okay, then.
Answer to me.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.280
Tell me what the hell
is going on.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.281
Nothing.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.817
Nothing.

08:36.817 --> 08:37.951
That's not gonna
cut it, Victor.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.553
Well, nothing
of consequence.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.421
I would call
losing the licenses

08:41.421 --> 08:42.656
a pretty stiff
consequence.

08:42.656 --> 08:45.626
We are not gonna
lose the licenses.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.294
That is not
what Derick says.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.929
Fuck Daniels.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.664
He doesn't know
the first thing

08:50.664 --> 08:51.932
about what happened, Hef.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.734
Okay,
those raids were staged

08:53.734 --> 08:55.102
based on evidence
provided by

08:55.102 --> 08:57.838
a crooked competitor's
paid informants.

08:59.472 --> 09:02.142
Look, it's a speed bump,
and when we're past it,

09:02.142 --> 09:04.845
it's not just gonna be
business as usual.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.214
It'll be bigger business.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.849
In fact, I already
have my eye

09:08.849 --> 09:10.150
on two new locations.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.952
Okay, okay. Let's worry
about the licenses

09:11.952 --> 09:13.453
before we
discuss expansion.

09:13.453 --> 09:15.555
Hey, you can worry about
the licenses if you want,

09:15.555 --> 09:18.358
but there
is nothing there.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.163
We've been through
a lot together, Vic.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.699
Yeah, we have.

09:25.699 --> 09:29.269
Don't let this thing
be the last.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.772
I promise you it won't.

09:38.612 --> 09:42.816
Derick Daniels had never
gotten along with Victor.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.819
They always clashed heads,
and it was often said

09:45.819 --> 09:50.557
it was a wonderful thing
that an ocean separated them.

09:50.557 --> 09:53.293
It was a definite
clash of personalities

09:53.293 --> 09:57.097
but also vying
for the attention of Hef.

09:59.299 --> 10:02.903
It didn't matter whether
or not I believed Vic.

10:02.903 --> 10:06.473
The problems in London
were under his watch,

10:06.473 --> 10:10.110
and now the entire
company was at risk.

10:10.110 --> 10:15.382
For Daniels, there was
only one solution.

10:15.382 --> 10:21.288
Derick wanted to fire Victor
and Hef had a problem with it.

10:21.288 --> 10:25.625
And then, we were told
by our British attorney

10:25.625 --> 10:28.762
that if Victor
were terminated,

10:28.762 --> 10:31.264
we may well
keep our license.

10:31.264 --> 10:35.669
This was a moment of
truth for the company.

10:35.669 --> 10:39.272
Our profits were coming
from the UK.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.342
Hefner had
a fiduciary responsibility

10:42.342 --> 10:44.644
as the CEO of the company

10:44.644 --> 10:48.481
to not only
protect the shareholders

10:48.481 --> 10:52.252
but his investment
and the future of the company.

11:03.630 --> 11:07.334
Victor and I had been close
friends for over 30 years

11:07.334 --> 11:11.471
and there were few people
I respected more,

11:11.471 --> 11:15.142
but with the future of the
London casino on the line,

11:15.142 --> 11:16.844
I had no choice but to make

11:16.844 --> 11:19.179
one of the hardest
decisions of my career.

11:23.116 --> 11:26.219
Yes. Can you put me through
to Derick Daniels, please?

11:47.007 --> 11:51.311
Victor! A pleasure
to see you, as always.

11:51.311 --> 11:55.482
Likewise.
Especially unannounced.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.788
This is my club.

12:00.788 --> 12:04.758
It's the company's club.
And I run the company.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.193
Really?

12:06.193 --> 12:08.428
I'm sure Hef would be
very keen to hear that.

12:08.428 --> 12:13.233
Oh, Hef sent me.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.903
We'd like you
to step down.

12:17.637 --> 12:18.671
Step down?

12:18.671 --> 12:20.107
Mm-hmm.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.242
This will send a message
to the gaming commission

12:22.242 --> 12:25.645
that we are serious about
cleaning up corruption.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.380
There is no corruption,

12:27.380 --> 12:29.182
which I will prove
at the hearing.

12:29.182 --> 12:34.287
But if you fire me, you're
basically admitting to it.

12:36.656 --> 12:39.259
The decision has been made.

12:49.903 --> 12:53.306
I knew we had trouble.
First trouble we'd had

12:53.306 --> 12:56.276
in 15 years of
operation in England,

12:56.276 --> 12:59.512
and I was prepared to
do battle with them.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.081
Unfortunately, I think

13:01.081 --> 13:03.917
they stampeded Hefner
into panicking

13:03.917 --> 13:06.419
when we ran into
difficulties in England

13:06.419 --> 13:08.755
and made it a first
order of business

13:08.755 --> 13:11.959
to, uh, terminate me.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.665
Playboy in London,
that was Victor's baby.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.834
It was all
very, very dramatic,

13:20.834 --> 13:25.772
and Victor was devastated
in every which way,

13:25.772 --> 13:28.108
and he was devastated
for Playboy.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.978
After the police raid,
he was suddenly

13:30.978 --> 13:34.714
and unexpectedly fired by
his American headquarters.

13:34.714 --> 13:37.717
Victor Lownes, now
the interested spectator,

13:37.717 --> 13:39.719
has not been asked
to give evidence.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.821
The sacking of you by
the men from Chicago...

13:41.821 --> 13:43.156
Yes.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.824
...would seem to be
a rather clumsy way

13:44.824 --> 13:46.526
of saying to the gaming
board and the law...

13:46.526 --> 13:47.360
Yes.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.029
...we are now clean again.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.497
We've got rid of
the number one culprit.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.531
Give us a chance.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.933
Do you think that's
the strategy?

13:52.933 --> 13:54.234
If I were
the number one saint,

13:54.234 --> 13:56.036
it'd still be
the strategy, yes.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.071
I mean, uh, regardless...

13:58.071 --> 14:00.540
And I do feel
that I did nothing wrong

14:00.540 --> 14:02.275
during my administration.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.947
For Victor to be fired
from Playboy,

14:06.947 --> 14:10.383
it was the biggest
personal tragedy

14:10.383 --> 14:15.455
as well as business tragedy
for both Hef and Victor.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.159
Looking back now,

14:19.159 --> 14:22.329
I wish I'd handled
things differently.

14:22.329 --> 14:25.165
Victor and I had been
through so much together

14:25.165 --> 14:28.168
and I didn't
even say goodbye.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.470
But what made it
even worse

14:30.470 --> 14:33.673
is that it was
all for nothing.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.208
The licensing magistrates,

14:35.208 --> 14:36.576
four women and a man,
issued their verdict.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.378
Very simply,
they said that Playboy

14:38.378 --> 14:40.813
was not fit and proper
to hold a gaming license

14:40.813 --> 14:44.117
and that the clubs had been
used for unlawful purposes.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.587
The London Playboy Club

14:47.587 --> 14:50.991
was still denied
its gambling license.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.928
What Hugh Hefner
and Derrick Daniels,

14:54.928 --> 14:56.930
I don't think,
grasped was,

14:56.930 --> 14:59.066
Victor Lownes actually
was still seen

14:59.066 --> 15:00.467
with a lot of prestige
and still had

15:00.467 --> 15:03.036
a big influence
in the UK gaming industry

15:03.036 --> 15:04.237
and still knew
what he was doing.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.473
He understood what
was going on in the UK

15:06.473 --> 15:09.509
much more than anyone,
and so, by getting rid of him,

15:09.509 --> 15:12.545
you're essentially removing
an asset from your company

15:12.545 --> 15:14.681
and an asset that very well
might have been able

15:14.681 --> 15:17.650
to guide Playboy
through the investigation

15:17.650 --> 15:21.554
without having to
lose its casino licenses.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.524
With the loss of
our gambling license,

15:24.524 --> 15:26.859
we had to sell off
all of our London assets,

15:26.859 --> 15:29.729
taking a huge
financial hit,

15:29.729 --> 15:33.200
but it turned out,
we had even more problems

15:33.200 --> 15:35.668
in Atlantic City.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.604
The applicant failed
the test that each of us

15:37.604 --> 15:40.407
is required to pass in
the conduct of our affairs.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.775
This applicant
has not met its burden

15:42.775 --> 15:44.877
to establish by clear
and convincing evidence

15:44.877 --> 15:49.482
its qualifications
to hold a casino license.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.220
Investigators
had looked through

15:53.220 --> 15:55.555
all of Playboy's
past business operations

15:55.555 --> 16:00.427
and dug up mistakes
we'd made in the past.

16:00.427 --> 16:04.597
The Casino Control Commission
comes out with a report

16:04.597 --> 16:06.333
detailing all these issues

16:06.333 --> 16:09.402
with Playboy's permanent
casino application.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.938
The vote went against
Hefner because of his part

16:11.938 --> 16:13.706
in bribing
New York officials

16:13.706 --> 16:16.209
to obtain a liquor
license 20 years ago.

16:16.209 --> 16:19.412
They go back 20-plus years.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.947
They look at anything
and everything

16:20.947 --> 16:22.649
connected to Hugh Hefner

16:22.649 --> 16:25.352
and the fact that
the British Gaming Board

16:25.352 --> 16:29.322
has just decided to yank
Playboy's casino licenses,

16:29.322 --> 16:31.091
so Playboy loses its bid

16:31.091 --> 16:33.393
for a permanent license
by a three-to-two vote.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.428
Licensing Playboy,
with its history,

16:35.428 --> 16:37.297
would signal the abandonment

16:37.297 --> 16:39.232
of virtually
all licensing criteria

16:39.232 --> 16:41.368
requiring ethical restraint.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.437
If the unethical practices
and illegal acts

16:44.437 --> 16:46.806
of corporations
are not checked,

16:46.806 --> 16:49.609
the future of a kind,
free casino industry

16:49.609 --> 16:52.779
in Atlantic City
would be in jeopardy.

16:52.779 --> 16:57.784
The verdict was a major
blow to our business,

16:57.784 --> 17:00.087
but I knew I had to
put on a brave face

17:00.087 --> 17:02.789
to maintain
our reputation.

17:02.789 --> 17:06.559
We are a sound,
broadly-based company,

17:06.559 --> 17:08.328
and we'll
not only survive,

17:08.328 --> 17:10.163
but we'll do very well
with or without gaming.

17:12.265 --> 17:15.668
But after losing both the
London casino operations

17:15.668 --> 17:20.039
and now the investment
in Atlantic City,

17:20.039 --> 17:24.111
the future of the company
was in jeopardy.

17:27.247 --> 17:30.983
I know things look
very dark right now,

17:30.983 --> 17:35.522
but this is fixable.

17:35.522 --> 17:36.756
Is it?

17:36.756 --> 17:39.292
Yeah, of course.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.261
But you had to
think about it.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.463
Oh, come on, Hef.

17:48.135 --> 17:52.139
We just lost
almost $200 million.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.673
Yes, yes, I'm well
aware how much money...

17:53.673 --> 17:57.210
How does that not put us
on the brink of extinction?

18:06.119 --> 18:09.856
With Playboy's reputation
at an all-time low,

18:09.856 --> 18:12.925
I knew we needed
to make a major change

18:12.925 --> 18:16.163
at the company if we were
going to get back on track,

18:16.163 --> 18:22.602
and it was clear that
Daniels wasn't cutting it,

18:22.602 --> 18:27.307
so I decided it was time to
put someone else in charge.

18:29.276 --> 18:32.979
**

18:32.979 --> 18:35.014
A couple of people
in the news tonight.

18:35.014 --> 18:37.217
Playboy Enterprises
has a new president.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.251
She's not
a former centerfold.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.786
She's Christie Hefner.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.422
Christie, pretty enough
to be a centerfold herself,

18:42.422 --> 18:45.592
will bring a new image
and new zest to Playboy.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.759
**

18:46.759 --> 18:48.695
A moment of truth came

18:48.695 --> 18:51.898
that things were not working
well with Derick Daniels.

18:51.898 --> 18:56.536
Hefner said, well,
so now what am I gonna do?

18:56.536 --> 19:01.974
We both agreed that Christie
would be an appropriate CEO.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.611
* Yo, pretty ladies
around the world *

19:04.611 --> 19:06.846
She says she must
now make Playboy

19:06.846 --> 19:09.516
a clearly focused
communications company

19:09.516 --> 19:12.385
instead of a corporation
that is broadly based...

19:12.385 --> 19:14.321
and I'm sure
she intended no pun.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.755
* We're about to go down *

19:15.755 --> 19:17.524
Christie was
my oldest child

19:17.524 --> 19:19.292
with my first wife,
Millie.

19:19.292 --> 19:22.629
I hadn't been around much
when she was growing up,

19:22.629 --> 19:25.365
but after she graduated
summa cum laude

19:25.365 --> 19:28.034
from Brandeis University
in 1974,

19:28.034 --> 19:30.537
Christie came
to work at Playboy

19:30.537 --> 19:33.072
in an entry-level position.

19:33.072 --> 19:35.375
I only saw my father
occasionally

19:35.375 --> 19:36.709
when I was growing up.

19:36.709 --> 19:40.613
I think that what allowed
us to get much closer

19:40.613 --> 19:42.582
was when I went to work
in the company,

19:42.582 --> 19:44.717
and the outgrowth
of that has been

19:44.717 --> 19:46.519
we're actually now
very close.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.389
* Word no matter
where you say it *

19:49.389 --> 19:51.991
I joined the company not
really expecting to stay

19:51.991 --> 19:55.262
more than a year or two,
but I did get interested

19:55.262 --> 19:58.030
in the variety of businesses
and the challenges

19:58.030 --> 19:59.966
and the people
that it attracted,

19:59.966 --> 20:01.834
and as I stayed and worked

20:01.834 --> 20:04.203
in different parts of the
company and learned more,

20:04.203 --> 20:06.172
I found it
more and more intriguing.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.940
* That you're acting
like fools *

20:07.940 --> 20:09.842
Christie was
extremely bright.

20:09.842 --> 20:16.082
She had a natural knack
for organizational efforts.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.418
Christie may have
been my daughter,

20:18.418 --> 20:21.020
but she quickly carved
a path all on her own

20:21.020 --> 20:22.522
within the company.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.624
Christie really
earned for herself

20:24.624 --> 20:26.893
a reputation
as a very level-headed,

20:26.893 --> 20:29.028
smart businesswoman.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.797
Her lifestyle and her image

20:30.797 --> 20:33.132
has been very different
than her father's.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.067
**

20:35.067 --> 20:37.904
And by 1982,
she had proven

20:37.904 --> 20:39.739
that she was
more than capable

20:39.739 --> 20:42.742
of taking over the reigns
of Playboy Enterprises.

20:42.742 --> 20:46.045
I would like to introduce
another Playboy executive

20:46.045 --> 20:50.483
who happens to be a woman,
one of whom I'm rather proud

20:50.483 --> 20:52.952
because she's
also my daughter,

20:52.952 --> 20:54.721
but I would be
very proud of her

20:54.721 --> 20:58.325
if she weren't my daughter,
Christie Hefner.

21:04.831 --> 21:08.435
My being named president
actually was well received,

21:08.435 --> 21:10.403
and I think that was because

21:10.403 --> 21:12.839
I'd been in the company
for seven years.

21:12.839 --> 21:16.509
People had seen me,
seen my work ethic,

21:16.509 --> 21:19.379
seen how I handled myself.

21:19.379 --> 21:25.352
Plus, I think the fact
that I was Christie Hefner,

21:25.352 --> 21:28.555
I think people
believed that I cared

21:28.555 --> 21:30.457
and that I cared
about the long term.

21:30.457 --> 21:33.826
There is a bright and shining
star in the Hefner family

21:33.826 --> 21:36.463
that's on the ascendency.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.766
An articulate,
committed young woman.

21:39.766 --> 21:42.168
And we are
going to be hearing

21:42.168 --> 21:44.971
a great deal from her
in the years to come.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.806
Christie,
we thank you very much

21:46.806 --> 21:48.441
for all that you're doing.

21:55.648 --> 22:01.521
But while there was no
better person for the job,

22:01.521 --> 22:06.726
Christie was inheriting
a difficult situation.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.528
They're calling it
the end of an era,

22:08.528 --> 22:09.996
the victim of
changing times.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.765
Playboy has closed down
its big city clubs

22:12.765 --> 22:15.535
in Los Angeles,
Chicago, and New York.

22:15.535 --> 22:19.539
Going into the middle
of the decade,

22:19.539 --> 22:22.442
we were on
the edge of bankruptcy.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.911
Playboy has lost millions
of dollars in recent years,

22:24.911 --> 22:26.579
much of it
because of the clubs.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.415
Joe, that's the end
of the "tail."

22:28.415 --> 22:30.316
Oh-ho-ho.
Very good, Bob.

22:30.316 --> 22:33.019
With the company
in crisis,

22:33.019 --> 22:35.555
Christie dove
right into work.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.356
When I took over
as president,

22:37.356 --> 22:40.026
my goal was
to save the company.

22:40.026 --> 22:44.263
The first order of business
was to stop the bleeding

22:44.263 --> 22:46.966
and so we sold
the businesses

22:46.966 --> 22:49.636
that we didn't think
we could make successes of,

22:49.636 --> 22:53.172
like the book business
and the record business

22:53.172 --> 22:55.575
and the resorts.

22:57.309 --> 23:01.247
Her efforts cut costs
by $8 million per year.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.049
Despite these measures,

23:03.049 --> 23:09.922
Playboy Enterprises still
lost $17.5 million in 1983.

23:09.922 --> 23:13.893
Christie recognized that
if we wanted to survive,

23:13.893 --> 23:17.029
we'd have to make
some bigger moves.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.932
**

23:19.932 --> 23:24.236
The world was consuming
media in new ways,

23:24.236 --> 23:28.240
and we needed to adapt
to changing times.

23:28.240 --> 23:32.579
VCRs were in almost every
home across the country

23:32.579 --> 23:34.013
and over 30 million people

23:34.013 --> 23:36.949
had started paying for
premium cable stations

23:36.949 --> 23:39.619
tailored
to their interests.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.253
Christie saw the chance
to offer them

23:41.253 --> 23:43.956
a whole new
Playboy experience.

23:43.956 --> 23:48.828
**

23:48.828 --> 23:50.830
The Playboy Channel.

23:50.830 --> 23:56.068
**

23:56.068 --> 23:58.070
When you start
talking about Playboy

23:58.070 --> 24:00.740
in combination
with pay television,

24:00.740 --> 24:02.875
people's eyes light up,
because it's about

24:02.875 --> 24:06.879
the hottest news in the
business going right now.

24:06.879 --> 24:09.649
**

24:09.649 --> 24:12.184
Cable TV created
the opportunity

24:12.184 --> 24:15.788
for destination viewing

24:15.788 --> 24:17.724
and a great way of expanding
the brand to women

24:17.724 --> 24:20.793
because the majority of
viewing was done by couples.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.362
Just the man
I was looking for.

24:23.362 --> 24:26.799
Cable television was one
of these great steps

24:26.799 --> 24:29.802
toward transforming
and liberating

24:29.802 --> 24:31.838
the dissemination
of information,

24:31.838 --> 24:36.375
and what this allowed for,
you know, Hugh Hefner

24:36.375 --> 24:39.646
was now to
have his own channel

24:39.646 --> 24:42.381
that he doesn't have to
kind of filter himself

24:42.381 --> 24:45.552
and his message
or his information,

24:45.552 --> 24:47.754
and this is, of course,
a way to make

24:47.754 --> 24:49.421
a tremendous amount
of money.

24:51.390 --> 24:53.392
Hiya, Hef!

24:53.392 --> 24:56.696
Airing between 8 p.m.
and 6 a.m. Eastern time,

24:56.696 --> 24:58.898
the Playboy TV Network

24:58.898 --> 25:00.499
became the country's
leading channel

25:00.499 --> 25:04.103
for adult entertainment,
and as the channel grew

25:04.103 --> 25:06.138
to more than 800,000
paying subscribers,

25:06.138 --> 25:10.142
it gave us a much needed
boost in revenue.

25:10.142 --> 25:15.014
**

25:15.014 --> 25:17.584
With the channel
proving to be a success,

25:17.584 --> 25:20.553
Christie turned
to the magazine,

25:20.553 --> 25:22.021
taking inspiration

25:22.021 --> 25:24.490
from Playboy's
very first issue.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.358
**

25:26.358 --> 25:29.095
As there were more and more
magazines proliferated

25:29.095 --> 25:32.098
from the time
when Playboy started,

25:32.098 --> 25:33.866
it became
increasingly important

25:33.866 --> 25:35.702
to be able to
distinguish yourself

25:35.702 --> 25:39.839
on the newsstand to attract
the interest of the buyer,

25:39.839 --> 25:44.944
and one clear way to do that
was through celebrities.

25:44.944 --> 25:48.848
**

25:54.220 --> 25:56.055
Women like Vanna White

25:56.055 --> 25:58.390
graced the covers and
helped us increase sales.

25:58.390 --> 26:02.094
**

26:02.094 --> 26:05.898
But in 1984, we were
offered exclusive rights

26:05.898 --> 26:07.333
to nude photos
of one celebrity

26:07.333 --> 26:10.803
who was sure
to cause controversy.

26:10.803 --> 26:13.172
A year earlier,

26:13.172 --> 26:16.075
20-year-old Vanessa
Williams had been crowned

26:16.075 --> 26:19.445
the first African-American
Miss America,

26:19.445 --> 26:20.980
but it didn't take long

26:20.980 --> 26:22.982
for someone
from her past to surface,

26:22.982 --> 26:25.351
looking to cash in
on her celebrity.

26:25.351 --> 26:29.121
Years ago, she'd posed
nude, but was told

26:29.121 --> 26:31.791
the photos would only
be used in silhouette.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.225
Now the photographer

26:33.225 --> 26:35.895
was shopping around
the full images.

26:35.895 --> 26:39.065
Vanessa Williams' pictures
were offered to the magazine,

26:39.065 --> 26:40.332
and there
wasn't any question

26:40.332 --> 26:42.234
that there would be
strong commercial appeal

26:42.234 --> 26:45.137
in this beautiful young
woman who was the first

26:45.137 --> 26:47.373
African-American
Miss America,

26:47.373 --> 26:49.041
but it was also
quite obvious

26:49.041 --> 26:50.710
that these were not pictures

26:50.710 --> 26:53.512
that she had intended
to have published.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.114
* Ain't no love *

26:55.114 --> 26:58.084
* In the heart
of the city *

26:58.084 --> 27:00.252
We knew that if Playboy
ran those photos,

27:00.252 --> 27:03.622
she'd be forced
to give up her crown.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.324
**

27:05.324 --> 27:08.160
It was not a difficult
decision to make,

27:08.160 --> 27:11.363
that if we ran those
pictures, we would destroy

27:11.363 --> 27:15.702
the career of the first
black Miss America,

27:15.702 --> 27:18.738
and that was the opposite

27:18.738 --> 27:20.840
of the kind of statement
we wanted to make.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.374
* Every place
that I go *

27:22.374 --> 27:24.243
Playboy rejected
the photos.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.378
* But it seems
so strange *

27:26.378 --> 27:28.514
You don't think
he would have sold

27:28.514 --> 27:31.350
a lot of Playboy magazines?
Most certainly!

27:31.350 --> 27:35.688
Very much could've
brought those photographs

27:35.688 --> 27:38.124
and put them in a magazine.

27:38.124 --> 27:42.762
What kind of man would
want to give a young woman

27:42.762 --> 27:44.496
that kind of pain?

27:44.496 --> 27:49.068
**

27:52.705 --> 27:55.341
But our longtime rival,
Penthouse,

27:55.341 --> 28:01.881
published the photos in
their September 1984 issue,

28:01.881 --> 28:04.616
and Williams
was forced to resign.

28:04.616 --> 28:06.585
Potential harm
to the pageant

28:06.585 --> 28:09.421
and the deep division that
a bitter fight may cause

28:09.421 --> 28:11.758
has convinced me
that I must relinquish

28:11.758 --> 28:15.194
my title as Miss America.

28:15.194 --> 28:19.031
It became the highest selling
Penthouse issue ever,

28:19.031 --> 28:22.701
and for the first time
in history,

28:22.701 --> 28:24.170
Penthouse sales beat ours

28:24.170 --> 28:27.940
by nearly
one million copies.

28:27.940 --> 28:31.077
But that success
was short-lived,

28:31.077 --> 28:33.145
and soon Playboy
was once again

28:33.145 --> 28:35.214
outselling Penthouse.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.415
**

28:40.252 --> 28:42.354
Although we had been
through many struggles

28:42.354 --> 28:45.324
over the past few years,
we never wavered

28:45.324 --> 28:46.993
in our commitment
to covering issues

28:46.993 --> 28:48.327
that other publications

28:48.327 --> 28:50.262
thought were
too controversial.

28:50.262 --> 28:54.500
And, in the mid '80s,
that issue was AIDS.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.536
Scientists at the National
Centers for Disease Control

28:57.536 --> 29:00.439
in Atlanta today released
the results of a study

29:00.439 --> 29:02.308
which shows that
the lifestyle

29:02.308 --> 29:06.212
of some male homosexuals
has triggered an epidemic.

29:06.212 --> 29:08.580
A strange, lethal,

29:08.580 --> 29:11.650
sexually transmitted
disease with no cure.

29:11.650 --> 29:14.320
It first appeared
in the gay community

29:14.320 --> 29:17.489
of New York City
and spread quickly.

29:17.489 --> 29:21.760
When AIDS starts off, at
least in the American mindset

29:21.760 --> 29:23.662
and in the media
as a gay disease

29:23.662 --> 29:25.297
but suddenly then winds up

29:25.297 --> 29:27.066
also affecting
straight people...

29:27.066 --> 29:30.837
The sexual revolution is
sex without consequences.

29:30.837 --> 29:34.140
Now, suddenly, the
consequences can be deadly,

29:34.140 --> 29:36.508
and this has
a tremendous effect

29:36.508 --> 29:40.746
on my generation
that grew up in the 1980s

29:40.746 --> 29:42.815
that suddenly,
wait a second,

29:42.815 --> 29:45.251
this is something we need
to be anxious about.

29:45.251 --> 29:47.719
Money for AIDS,
not for war!

29:47.719 --> 29:49.788
But the government
and the national press

29:49.788 --> 29:52.591
largely ignored the crisis,

29:52.591 --> 29:55.494
believing the subject
was too controversial.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.529
The federal role must be
to give educators

29:57.529 --> 30:00.399
accurate information
about the disease.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.668
Now, how that
information is used

30:02.668 --> 30:07.473
must be up to schools
and parents, not government.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.909
But I was determined
to make sure Playboy

30:09.909 --> 30:12.644
addressed the issue
head on.

30:12.644 --> 30:17.449
**

30:21.720 --> 30:24.190
* It used to be so easy *

30:24.190 --> 30:27.759
* To be your lover *

30:27.759 --> 30:30.462
When the AIDS epidemic
started,

30:30.462 --> 30:34.466
and then-President Reagan
wouldn't even say the word,

30:34.466 --> 30:37.336
Playboy played,
I think, an important role

30:37.336 --> 30:40.772
in educating people
about how the disease

30:40.772 --> 30:43.675
was transmitted
and wasn't transmitted.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.979
* Take it easy on me *

30:46.979 --> 30:49.882
* It should be
easy to see *

30:49.882 --> 30:51.817
Playboy ran dozens
of articles

30:51.817 --> 30:54.386
addressing
the AIDS crisis,

30:54.386 --> 30:57.089
along with interviews
and any other formats

30:57.089 --> 30:59.458
we could think of
to spread awareness.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.561
* Just want you to know *

31:02.561 --> 31:06.465
When AIDS came along, it came
with the frightening thought

31:06.465 --> 31:10.569
that everybody who engaged
in sex with a stranger

31:10.569 --> 31:12.004
was going to get AIDS.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.941
That was full of mythology.

31:14.941 --> 31:18.978
I wrote a short
editorial about AIDS.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.713
We dealt with AIDS as
scientifically as we could.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.782
* But whatever you do *

31:23.782 --> 31:28.287
* Take it easy on me *

31:28.287 --> 31:32.091
**

31:33.525 --> 31:35.394
Over the past
three decades,

31:35.394 --> 31:37.229
Playboy had
covered a wide range

31:37.229 --> 31:40.032
of controversial topics,

31:40.032 --> 31:44.170
and I was always proud
of the work we did,

31:44.170 --> 31:46.738
but I was getting tired.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.641
Christie had been at
the helm for six years

31:49.641 --> 31:52.378
and proven she could
run the company.

31:52.378 --> 31:57.183
After 35 years,
I decided, at age 62,

31:57.183 --> 32:01.453
that I needed to step
back and settle down.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.222
Though I'd shared my life

32:03.222 --> 32:05.691
with many incredible
women over the years,

32:05.691 --> 32:09.361
I'd sworn that I would
never marry again.

32:09.361 --> 32:13.532
That is, until I
met Kimberley Conrad.

32:13.532 --> 32:16.335
**

32:18.604 --> 32:21.974
Kimberley Conrad came to us

32:21.974 --> 32:24.943
as a potential Playmate

32:24.943 --> 32:27.980
from a photographer
in Vancouver.

32:27.980 --> 32:32.151
Kimberley played
hard to get, actually.

32:32.151 --> 32:35.221
She was very attractive
and a lot of fun.

32:35.221 --> 32:37.456
I met Kimberley
when she posed

32:37.456 --> 32:40.692
for our January 1988
Playmate of the month.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.194
**

32:42.194 --> 32:45.197
I had met many of our
Playmates in the past,

32:45.197 --> 32:47.833
but there was something
special about Kimberley.

32:47.833 --> 32:52.071
* She's just
a fallen angel *

32:52.071 --> 32:56.275
I felt an immediate sense
of ease with her.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.777
* We're all fallen angels *

32:58.777 --> 33:00.046
Hello.

33:00.046 --> 33:01.713
This was our best
Christmas ever.

33:01.713 --> 33:03.615
It was.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.784
It didn't take either
of us long to realize

33:05.784 --> 33:08.354
that we were madly in love.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.322
By February of that year,

33:10.322 --> 33:13.659
Kimberley had moved
into the mansion.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.128
From there,
things moved quickly.

33:16.128 --> 33:20.299
* She's looking for the love
that she's never had *

33:20.299 --> 33:25.171
* I know she's just
a fallen angel *

33:25.171 --> 33:27.106
Kimberly was named
Playmate of the Year

33:27.106 --> 33:29.108
in June of 1989...

33:29.108 --> 33:30.776
Having been in,
over the years,

33:30.776 --> 33:32.244
a number of
romantic relationships,

33:32.244 --> 33:34.413
this is different.

33:37.816 --> 33:40.819
...and became Kimberly
Hefner in July.

33:40.819 --> 33:43.755
**

33:43.755 --> 33:47.326
This is probably
as good a moment as any

33:47.326 --> 33:50.929
to thank all of you
for sharing with us

33:50.929 --> 33:52.998
a rather unique evening.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.070
One that you thought
you'd never see.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.441
I think that meeting Kimberley
is very much a matter

34:02.441 --> 34:05.311
of having met
the right person

34:05.311 --> 34:07.513
in the right place
at the right time.

34:07.513 --> 34:09.548
I was ready for that
kind of relationship,

34:09.548 --> 34:11.950
and she had the values
that I was looking for,

34:11.950 --> 34:13.519
and she came to me
at a time

34:13.519 --> 34:15.254
in which I was
looking for a safe harbor

34:15.254 --> 34:17.223
after some very stormy seas.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.258
**

34:19.258 --> 34:21.627
Getting married was
only the beginning.

34:21.627 --> 34:24.330
Wait, I'm right here!
Be careful!

34:24.330 --> 34:28.134
Don't drop it.
Look! Look!

34:28.134 --> 34:31.770
I think somebody's
on his nap time.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.673
Within a year,
our happy family expanded

34:34.673 --> 34:36.842
when our son Marston
was born.

34:36.842 --> 34:40.112
* It never really mattered
too much to me *

34:40.112 --> 34:42.080
Where are you going,
little guy?

34:42.080 --> 34:45.784
And the year after that,
his brother, Cooper.

34:45.784 --> 34:48.320
Hefner was not
really a parent

34:48.320 --> 34:52.758
to his two children he had
with his first wife, Millie,

34:52.758 --> 34:55.961
because he was busy
with his business,

34:55.961 --> 34:57.196
with starting the magazine.

34:57.196 --> 35:00.866
The two boys
he had with Kimberley

35:00.866 --> 35:03.835
were doted on by Hefner.

35:03.835 --> 35:05.237
In their very early years,

35:05.237 --> 35:07.239
they spent a lot of time
at the mansion,

35:07.239 --> 35:10.409
playing with the animals
and Hefner.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.178
You're such a big guy.

35:12.178 --> 35:13.679
* Let me love you *

35:13.679 --> 35:17.349
When my brother and I came
along, my dad was older.

35:17.349 --> 35:20.719
I think he, in his head,
wanted to try being a parent,

35:20.719 --> 35:22.988
so, I mean,
I saw him every single day.

35:22.988 --> 35:25.157
He was much more hands on

35:25.157 --> 35:27.193
in the sense
of being a father.

35:27.193 --> 35:28.960
You ready to go?

35:28.960 --> 35:31.497
Almost overnight,
the mansion went

35:31.497 --> 35:35.667
from the world's most
famous bachelor pad

35:35.667 --> 35:40.506
to an island of
domestic tranquility.

35:40.506 --> 35:43.375
With my first marriage,
I knew I hadn't always

35:43.375 --> 35:46.512
been the best husband
or father,

35:46.512 --> 35:48.280
but having
this second chance

35:48.280 --> 35:50.582
gave me
a new lease on life.

35:50.582 --> 35:56.054
It was truly one of
my happiest times.

35:56.054 --> 36:00.292
Not until the baby was born
did I really realize

36:00.292 --> 36:03.595
what an impact it could
have on my own life.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.497
It should've been that
way the first time,

36:05.497 --> 36:08.967
but, of course,
I just wasn't there,

36:08.967 --> 36:11.670
emotionally or mentally.

36:11.670 --> 36:15.707
And I think it's wonderful
to have the chance

36:15.707 --> 36:18.377
to do it all right
the second time.

36:18.377 --> 36:20.812
I was busy trying
to play catch up

36:20.812 --> 36:25.651
with my other two children
after they were grown.

36:25.651 --> 36:29.621
This time,
I don't want to miss

36:29.621 --> 36:31.357
all the wonderful part
in between.

36:35.927 --> 36:39.130
But sadly, that
happiness did not last.

36:39.130 --> 36:43.869
**

36:43.869 --> 36:46.605
Over time, it became clear
that Kimberley and I

36:46.605 --> 36:50.008
weren't as compatible as I
had originally believed.

36:50.008 --> 36:53.612
**

36:53.612 --> 36:56.882
Our marriage came to an end
after nine years.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.885
**

36:59.885 --> 37:02.821
In the end, the most
important thing

37:02.821 --> 37:05.924
was the boys.

37:05.924 --> 37:10.061
Although it hadn't worked
out with me and Kimberley,

37:10.061 --> 37:12.498
I wanted my sons near me.

37:12.498 --> 37:15.534
He bought a house
next door to the mansion,

37:15.534 --> 37:19.638
and Kimberley and the boys
grew up in that house.

37:19.638 --> 37:21.740
This is to our new house.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.410
Hopefully the neighbors won't
complain about our music.

37:24.410 --> 37:27.145
Hefner wanted it that close

37:27.145 --> 37:29.014
so that he could be
with the boys.

37:29.014 --> 37:32.284
He and Kimberley had
a reasonable relationship

37:32.284 --> 37:35.987
before the actual divorce
and even now.

37:35.987 --> 37:38.990
It wasn't easy at first,

37:38.990 --> 37:40.792
but I soon realized

37:40.792 --> 37:44.129
I still had
a lot of life to live.

37:44.129 --> 37:50.436
**

37:53.305 --> 37:56.074
After years
of being settled down,

37:56.074 --> 37:59.811
Mr. Playboy was back.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.513
Once again,
the mansion became

38:01.513 --> 38:02.914
the party destination

38:02.914 --> 38:04.916
for Hollywood's
A-list celebrities.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.618
You know
how to do it, Hugh!

38:06.618 --> 38:08.053
And, of course,

38:08.053 --> 38:10.822
the most beautiful
women in the world.

38:10.822 --> 38:15.093
Before I knew it,
in 2003,

38:15.093 --> 38:18.764
Playboy had reached
another milestone...

38:18.764 --> 38:20.265
**

38:20.265 --> 38:23.101
...our 50th anniversary.

38:23.101 --> 38:26.838
I could not have imagined,
on any kind of level,

38:26.838 --> 38:28.807
the impact
the magazine would have,

38:28.807 --> 38:31.109
how it would change
my life.

38:31.109 --> 38:33.845
Who could have imagined it?

38:35.881 --> 38:37.683
But the early 2000s

38:37.683 --> 38:40.185
brought something we could
have never expected...

38:40.185 --> 38:44.089
**

38:44.089 --> 38:46.057
...the Internet.

38:46.057 --> 38:48.293
**

38:48.293 --> 38:50.562
The rise of the Internet

38:50.562 --> 38:52.864
destroys the business
model of Playboy.

38:52.864 --> 38:57.603
There is no way that you
can sell printed material

38:57.603 --> 38:59.905
or even a channel

38:59.905 --> 39:02.908
when you have to compete
with free video,

39:02.908 --> 39:06.945
open access, and any
kind of porn you want.

39:06.945 --> 39:10.416
**

39:10.416 --> 39:12.117
But while we
couldn't compete

39:12.117 --> 39:15.854
with what was online,
there was one new trend

39:15.854 --> 39:18.757
that was a perfect fit
for Playboy.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.859
Welcome to
the Playboy Mansion.

39:20.859 --> 39:24.396
**

39:24.396 --> 39:28.667
And with reality TV
being all the rage,

39:28.667 --> 39:30.669
I knew it could be
the perfect way

39:30.669 --> 39:33.572
to move Playboy
into the 21st century.

39:33.572 --> 39:34.973
I invited the world

39:34.973 --> 39:38.209
into the Playboy Mansion
every week

39:38.209 --> 39:39.745
as the Playmates and I

39:39.745 --> 39:42.448
just went about
living our lives.

39:42.448 --> 39:43.449
You look cute.
Do you have boob glue on?

39:43.449 --> 39:44.450
No.

39:44.450 --> 39:46.184
You don't?

39:46.184 --> 39:50.155
It was called
The Girls Next Door.

39:50.155 --> 39:51.757
Initially with
The Girls Next Door,

39:51.757 --> 39:53.825
there was kind of
the belief that this

39:53.825 --> 39:56.462
was going to draw
more of a male audience.

39:56.462 --> 39:57.996
Is anybody going
skinny-dipping?

39:57.996 --> 39:59.865
The truth is, it actually

39:59.865 --> 40:02.100
attracted a predominantly
female audience.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.736
This is the original
vibrating, rotating bed

40:04.736 --> 40:06.337
from the Chicago Mansion,
you know.

40:06.337 --> 40:08.273
Really?
Does it still work?

40:09.775 --> 40:12.177
People loved the girls.

40:12.177 --> 40:16.414
There was something relatable
about each of them.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.016
**

40:18.016 --> 40:19.885
It lasted six seasons

40:19.885 --> 40:23.354
and introduced Playboy
to a whole new generation,

40:23.354 --> 40:26.324
and it became one of
the most successful shows

40:26.324 --> 40:28.259
in the history
of E! Network,

40:28.259 --> 40:31.229
with over 2 million
viewers at its peak.

40:31.229 --> 40:32.664
**

40:32.664 --> 40:35.133
Then, something
unexpected happened.

40:35.133 --> 40:39.705
**

40:39.705 --> 40:41.907
In the final season
of the show,

40:41.907 --> 40:44.910
I was introduced
to Crystal Harris.

40:44.910 --> 40:49.047
She was our December 2009
Playmate of the Month

40:49.047 --> 40:52.217
and we quickly fell
in love.

40:52.217 --> 40:54.352
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I introduce

40:54.352 --> 40:57.523
for the first time,
Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Hefner.

40:59.725 --> 41:01.960
And after years of dating,

41:01.960 --> 41:05.764
we were married
on December 31st, 2012.

41:05.764 --> 41:09.334
Hef is a very romantic guy.

41:09.334 --> 41:11.603
He adores Crystal

41:11.603 --> 41:14.472
and they have a very,
very happy marriage,

41:14.472 --> 41:18.376
and he is probably
more of a husband now

41:18.376 --> 41:20.646
than he was
earlier in his life,

41:20.646 --> 41:23.782
because he has more time
to spend with his wife

41:23.782 --> 41:26.151
than he did with
the other two women.

41:26.151 --> 41:30.021
**

41:30.021 --> 41:31.857
My relationship
with Crystal

41:31.857 --> 41:34.292
couldn't be more perfect,

41:34.292 --> 41:38.597
and I'm happier today
that I've ever been.

41:38.597 --> 41:43.434
She really is
my one true love.

41:43.434 --> 41:46.705
**

41:46.705 --> 41:48.439
It's been over six decades

41:48.439 --> 41:52.143
since I started a magazine
at my kitchen table,

41:52.143 --> 41:56.381
and in the years since,
Playboy has expanded

41:56.381 --> 42:01.452
beyond my wildest dreams.

42:01.452 --> 42:06.024
Our updated London casino,
which opened in 2011,

42:06.024 --> 42:08.026
is one of
the most successful

42:08.026 --> 42:11.396
private club casinos
in the world,

42:11.396 --> 42:13.031
and our branded products

42:13.031 --> 42:18.269
brought in $1.5 billion
in 2016.

42:18.269 --> 42:20.839
To this day, Playboy

42:20.839 --> 42:23.208
is the third-most
recognizable brand

42:23.208 --> 42:24.309
in the world,

42:24.309 --> 42:29.047
after only Apple
and Coca-Cola.

42:29.047 --> 42:30.982
I never
could have imagined

42:30.982 --> 42:35.386
that the conversations
I started in 1953

42:35.386 --> 42:39.958
would continue to this day.

42:39.958 --> 42:43.762
**

42:43.762 --> 42:46.632
Looking back on my life,

42:46.632 --> 42:49.167
I see so many things.

42:49.167 --> 42:52.971
**

42:55.807 --> 42:58.143
What do you think
of this?

42:59.911 --> 43:03.014
Hefner is one of the
most underrated forces

43:03.014 --> 43:05.717
in American life in the
second half of the 20th century.

43:05.717 --> 43:09.855
Hefner changed the way
everybody thinks about sex.

43:09.855 --> 43:12.023
Congratulations,
Mr. Playboy.

43:14.225 --> 43:18.096
He took us
from '50s innocence

43:18.096 --> 43:22.300
to '60s curiosity
to '70s revolution.

43:22.300 --> 43:25.303
He created the sexual
revolution, in my opinion,

43:25.303 --> 43:29.207
and should have
all the credit for that.

43:29.207 --> 43:32.010
**

43:32.010 --> 43:33.879
Cheers! To the Playboy Club!

43:33.879 --> 43:35.681
To the Playboy Club!

43:35.681 --> 43:37.783
When most people hear
the name "Hugh Hefner,"

43:37.783 --> 43:40.518
they think of the
magazine, the pictures,

43:40.518 --> 43:42.654
and....and ooh-ee.

43:42.654 --> 43:45.757
Well, Hugh Hefner
was a real, authentic,

43:45.757 --> 43:48.293
First Amendment devotee.

43:48.293 --> 43:50.896
To him, it really was about
the freedom of expression.

43:50.896 --> 43:52.363
Police yesterday

43:52.363 --> 43:54.565
carted two tons of
obscene magazines,

43:54.565 --> 43:55.967
films, and photographs

43:55.967 --> 43:57.869
to the city incinerator
and burned them.

43:57.869 --> 44:00.238
I am not a big fan
of censorship,

44:00.238 --> 44:01.907
and I'm glad I was born

44:01.907 --> 44:05.877
after the people who came
before me, like Hugh Hefner.

44:05.877 --> 44:07.378
A lot of these people
have got a lot of arrows.

44:07.378 --> 44:10.782
Now, I've gotten some,
but not the way they did.

44:10.782 --> 44:13.819
We stand on
each other's shoulders.

44:13.819 --> 44:16.154
**

44:16.154 --> 44:18.857
It wasn't that his attitudes

44:18.857 --> 44:21.326
or point of view on sex
were revolutionary.

44:21.326 --> 44:25.196
It was his ability
to deliver the message

44:25.196 --> 44:27.598
as well as promote
a conversation about it

44:27.598 --> 44:29.500
that was really
revolutionary.

44:29.500 --> 44:33.839
The magazine and the company
just became the messenger of,

44:33.839 --> 44:36.141
these are conversations
we should be having

44:36.141 --> 44:38.910
and these are topics we should
be thinking about a lot more.

44:38.910 --> 44:41.980
He didn't introduce
the world to sex.

44:41.980 --> 44:45.751
He just allowed it
to step out of the closet.

44:45.751 --> 44:48.453
Yes, yes.
Straight down the lens.

44:48.453 --> 44:49.821
Perfect.

44:49.821 --> 44:52.824
I think he was confident
of what he had done,

44:52.824 --> 44:56.094
how he had lived,
what he believed.

44:56.094 --> 45:00.899
He's remarkably able to
weather very difficult times

45:00.899 --> 45:02.467
because of that.

45:02.467 --> 45:04.535
**

45:04.535 --> 45:06.671
I think part of what
my pursuit of happiness

45:06.671 --> 45:09.674
has been all about
has been an attempt

45:09.674 --> 45:11.342
to walk a different road.

45:11.342 --> 45:14.279
**

45:14.279 --> 45:17.615
There is no fantasy that
I have not lived out.

45:17.615 --> 45:23.121
**

45:23.121 --> 45:24.756
If I were gonna
rewrite my life

45:24.756 --> 45:26.925
from beginning to end,

45:26.925 --> 45:30.661
I might change
a few punctuation marks,

45:30.661 --> 45:32.397
but the things
that mattered

45:32.397 --> 45:33.832
could hardly have
worked out any better.

45:33.832 --> 45:36.835
**

45:39.637 --> 45:43.441
* Every little movement *

45:43.441 --> 45:47.946
* Every motion of your hips *

45:47.946 --> 45:50.715
* I feel the compulsion *

45:50.715 --> 45:56.287
* To pull you
to my sweet lips *

45:56.287 --> 46:00.291
* Is it a black magic spell *

46:00.291 --> 46:03.795
* You put me under? *

46:03.795 --> 46:07.298
* This miracle moment *

46:07.298 --> 46:11.436
* Never let it end *

46:11.436 --> 46:15.440
* Every little movement *

46:15.440 --> 46:19.845
* Is beyond improvement *

46:19.845 --> 46:22.247
* You are the magician *

46:22.247 --> 46:27.318
* I've been wishing for
forever *

46:27.318 --> 46:31.322
* Every
little movement *

46:31.322 --> 46:35.326
* Every little movement **
