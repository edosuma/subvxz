01:03.063 --> 01:05.703
<i>I'm not that good
at lot of stuff.</i>

01:07.834 --> 01:10.280
<i>Especially thinking
things through.</i>

01:13.507 --> 01:15.418
<i>And that's why this
plan was so shitty.</i>

01:20.347 --> 01:25.092
<i>But my feelings were hurt, and I'm glad
I at least did something about it.</i>

01:30.357 --> 01:31.997
<i>Making bad decisions
is nothing new to me.</i>

01:33.594 --> 01:36.200
<i>After all, I live alone at 40,</i>

01:36.597 --> 01:40.602
<i>and I make my living
proofreading product warranties.</i>

01:42.302 --> 01:44.111
<i>A few weeks ago, I took
a break from that,</i>

01:44.237 --> 01:46.080
<i>however, so I could
do this whole thing.</i>

01:46.940 --> 01:49.216
<i>And it's pretty ironic
that what I did</i>

01:49.309 --> 01:51.550
<i>was exactly what a
child would do.</i>

01:52.613 --> 01:55.492
<i>I threw a tantrum just
to get attention.</i>

01:56.049 --> 01:57.790
You must be really proud.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.488
I know I am.

02:00.988 --> 02:02.661
And excited.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.467
Meet "The Big Man," right?

02:07.494 --> 02:10.633
But proud either way, of course.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.975
Aren't they amazing? Which one's yours?
Mine's...

02:16.069 --> 02:17.139
Buddy, no' thank you.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.340
What's that?

02:18.438 --> 02:21.578
This chat. I'm all set. I'm just trying
to get some food in my face before

02:21.642 --> 02:24.145
I get stuck up on
that stage, okay?

02:25.746 --> 02:28.590
Right. My bad. You must
be our host for today.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.822
No, I'm not.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.260
I'm the winner.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.031
Everyone, it's
time for the 15th.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.533
Annual Regional
Spelling Bee to begin.

02:37.624 --> 02:40.264
Take your seats, please. All
of our noble contestants.

02:40.327 --> 02:43.308
Please take your seats up on the stage.
Hurry, hurry!

02:43.764 --> 02:44.936
We're on schedule.

02:51.938 --> 02:55.613
I love the way the hush just comes over
the crowd before we start. Here we go.

03:03.283 --> 03:05.627
What are you doing on
the stage, weirdo?

03:08.789 --> 03:11.167
Your chair called me for help.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.997
It was saying, "Help me.
It's so heavy."

03:19.066 --> 03:21.478
You didn't hear it? I heard it.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.341
I'm sorry, sir.

03:24.471 --> 03:27.816
Those seats are for
the competitors only.

03:28.308 --> 03:30.015
Great. I'm in the right spot.

03:34.514 --> 03:36.084
Mr. Trilby, I won't allow it.

03:36.183 --> 03:39.721
You're not eligible in any
fashion, way, shape or manner.

03:39.820 --> 03:40.855
Page 39

03:40.921 --> 03:43.094
of the Golden Quill National
Spelling Bee rulebook.

03:43.323 --> 03:47.669
This is rule number 24. This is
sub-point B. This is a quote.

03:48.428 --> 03:50.589
"The speller must not have
passed beyond the 8th grade"

03:50.664 --> 03:53.235
"on or before
February 1st, 2011."

03:53.333 --> 03:56.177
That is a rule written by
the governing institute.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.512
And if you want, you can
continue to ogle my transcript,

03:58.572 --> 03:59.949
just please don't
wrinkle it any further.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.678
But you can see
there, unfortunately,

04:01.775 --> 04:03.345
I have not passed the 8th grade

04:03.410 --> 04:05.913
on or before February 1st.
Not ever.

04:06.012 --> 04:07.013
That may be, but...

04:07.080 --> 04:09.219
But, sir, I can go on. I
can go on and on and on.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.091
There are 83 paragraphs,

04:11.184 --> 04:12.959
581 lines of rules
in the rulebook,

04:13.053 --> 04:15.590
but lei me assure you, I'm compliant
with every single one of them.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.930
The spelling bee
is meant for kids.

04:18.024 --> 04:22.029
Not adults that couldn't
even graduate the 8th grade.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.267
Oh, boy.

04:23.363 --> 04:25.240
Are we past the rules and
into the insults now?

04:25.365 --> 04:26.810
Is it insult time? I'm
sorry, but you're an adult.

04:26.900 --> 04:27.940
Because your potholder vest

04:27.968 --> 04:29.811
is about to take heavy fire.
Are you ready for that'?

04:29.903 --> 04:33.373
You know what? Enough. This
is all just a moot point.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.784
Every contestant
must be sponsored

04:35.909 --> 04:38.253
by a nationally-recognized
news service.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.483
The end. Mmm, I understand.

04:39.579 --> 04:40.956
That doesn't end
the conversation.

04:41.047 --> 04:42.549
- Guess what?
- Hello.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.323
Perfect timing.
What's going on here?

04:44.417 --> 04:45.418
Who is this?

04:45.485 --> 04:48.295
This is my sponsor from a
nationally-recognized news service.

04:48.388 --> 04:49.890
Jenny Widgeon. The
Click and Scroll.

04:49.956 --> 04:50.957
The what?

04:51.057 --> 04:52.593
What's that? Is that
something on the computer?

04:52.659 --> 04:53.699
Yes, we're an online paper.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.003
Said differently, a
nationally-recognized news service.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.576
They don't want to
let me participate.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.407
Go ahead. Set it in motion.
I love your vest.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.502
He's an adult.

05:01.601 --> 05:02.602
In about a half an hour,

05:02.669 --> 05:04.478
you're gonna be receiving a
temporary restraining order

05:04.571 --> 05:07.142
and a preliminary injunction
prohibiting the continuation

05:07.240 --> 05:09.811
of this competition until we clear
this whole legal matter up.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.471
Plus, and this is a
selfish note for me,

05:11.511 --> 05:12.990
it's gonna make one
hell of a story.

05:13.079 --> 05:15.320
How dare you try to hijack
this spelling bee contest!

05:15.415 --> 05:16.416
What did you call me?

05:16.583 --> 05:17.584
Hijack. Yes.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.789
I'm a hijacker now?

05:18.852 --> 05:19.922
You're on the hook
for defamation, too.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.294
My attorneys will be in touch

05:21.421 --> 05:22.627
with both of you. Let's
get out of here.

05:22.689 --> 05:23.729
But before we go, actually,

05:23.757 --> 05:24.792
I'd like to watch
the both of you

05:24.858 --> 05:26.531
address those poor,
wonderful children

05:26.660 --> 05:28.298
and their very
supportive parents

05:28.361 --> 05:29.704
when you tell them

05:29.796 --> 05:31.673
that they have no shot
at the National Bee

05:31.765 --> 05:33.506
or an opportunity to
meet "The Big Man."

05:33.600 --> 05:34.840
That I want to see. They're
gonna be crestfallen.

05:34.935 --> 05:35.936
I know of one father
in particular

05:36.002 --> 05:38.175
who's gonna have to find a whole
new way to empty out his ball bag.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.591
Let's do it. Bullies and insulters first.
You lead the way.

05:40.607 --> 05:43.281
Or should I go first, the idiot hijacker?
Should I lead?

05:43.476 --> 05:45.114
No one called you an idiot. You lead.
You guys decide.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.885
While you decide, I'm gonna
bang out a couple of prayers.

05:46.980 --> 05:47.981
Which way is Mecca?

05:48.048 --> 05:49.118
Oleaginous.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.286
Oleaginous?

05:50.617 --> 05:51.617
Oleaginous.

05:51.651 --> 05:52.652
Oleaginous.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.122
Can I have the
definition, please?

05:55.322 --> 05:58.633
"Having the nature or
qualities of oil,"

05:59.125 --> 06:02.902
or "Unctuous, fawning, smarmy."

06:05.732 --> 06:08.372
Oleaginous.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.243
Does it contain the Latin
root olea, meaning "olive"?

06:11.538 --> 06:12.881
It does.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.716
Oleaginous. Can I have
the part of speech?

06:16.476 --> 06:18.717
It's an adjective. Am I right?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.360
Yes.

06:22.415 --> 06:24.088
Any other pronunciations? No.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.097
Oleaginous.

06:28.188 --> 06:31.829
O-L-E-A-G-I-N-O-U-S.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.038
- That is correct.
- We got it.

06:42.369 --> 06:43.404
Hi.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.439
Absquatulate.

06:47.874 --> 06:52.186
A-B-S-Q-U-A-T-U-L-A-T-E.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.350
That's...

06:54.748 --> 06:55.783
Correct.

06:57.350 --> 06:58.886
Correct. Thank you.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.764
Hey, Moms, let's break out the
rubber pillowcases tonight.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.461
Little pricks, you're gonna
be countin' tears, not sheep.

07:05.725 --> 07:06.760
Who's next?

08:31.845 --> 08:33.518
Not now, please.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.217
Guy, I need some more.

08:35.315 --> 08:36.350
No.

08:36.448 --> 08:38.190
Why, at the age of 40...
Come on.

08:38.284 --> 08:41.663
Have you decided to annoy
educators, parents and children

08:41.721 --> 08:43.722
by forcing your way into
a kids' spelling bee?

08:43.823 --> 08:45.029
Can't you see I'm
trying to sleep?

08:45.125 --> 08:47.196
Guy, I get at least one
answer per tournament.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.830
I have three very
paltry answers.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.876
It's time for my fourth. Shh!

08:54.334 --> 08:55.972
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.916
While I'm gone, I want you
to ask yourself this.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.882
Will, when all of this is over,

08:59.973 --> 09:02.385
a five-answer article

09:02.475 --> 09:04.921
be equal compensation
for eight weeks

09:05.011 --> 09:06.718
of covered hotel
room accommodations,

09:06.813 --> 09:09.851
qualifying tournament entry
fees, rental car damage,

09:09.916 --> 09:11.020
not to mention
emotional expense?

09:11.084 --> 09:12.084
Are you not gonna get up?

09:12.152 --> 09:13.722
Why? Go. You've got room.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.265
Jesus Christ. If you
gave me the window,

09:15.355 --> 09:16.493
I wouldn't have to move.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.557
Yeah.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.826
Don't drag that thing across me.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.205
It's full. You just
told me it's full.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.038
I don't want it on me.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.917
Hi. I'm Chaitanya Chopra.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.715
Was that English?

09:42.215 --> 09:43.785
My name is Chaitanya.

09:43.883 --> 09:44.953
Oh.

09:45.051 --> 09:46.189
Congratulations.

09:46.686 --> 09:47.926
What's yours? No.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.864
What's your name?
Spin it around.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.867
I'm going to the Golden Quill.
Good for you.

09:51.925 --> 09:52.960
My parents are up
in first class.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.128
Great.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.863
My dad says that economy
class builds character.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.965
Amazing.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.771
I was in last year's tournament.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.606
I overheard you say
you're going, too.

10:02.068 --> 10:03.706
You're the grown-up
who's competing, huh?

10:04.404 --> 10:07.214
I heard about you. What
was your winning word?

10:07.273 --> 10:08.377
I don't know.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.478
What was the word you spelled
to win your regional?

10:10.577 --> 10:11.612
To get here?

10:11.711 --> 10:14.453
I don't fucking remember.
Do you see my eyes closed?

10:14.547 --> 10:16.788
Mine was "intelligentsia?
Awesome."

10:16.883 --> 10:18.954
Come on, try. How
could you forget?

10:19.052 --> 10:20.429
It's such a special word.

10:29.729 --> 10:32.073
It was "autofellatio." Okay?

10:33.566 --> 10:35.136
I've never heard of that word.
Yeah.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.339
What's its origin?

10:37.237 --> 10:38.648
Loneliness.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.612
No, that can't be right. It is.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.988
I know "auto" is of Greek
origin, meaning "self," right'?

10:46.746 --> 10:50.159
Fellatio. Fellatio, fellatio.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.761
Is that derived from the Latin
fellare, meaning "to suck"?

10:55.255 --> 10:56.290
Little man,

10:56.823 --> 10:58.302
the woman I'm sitting next to

10:58.358 --> 10:59.598
knows her way around
that subject real well,

10:59.659 --> 11:01.935
so why don't you ask her when she
gets back from droppin' her deuce?

11:01.995 --> 11:04.805
Meanwhile, if you don't point
that curry hole that way

11:04.864 --> 11:06.544
and sit your fuckin'
ass down in that seat,

11:06.599 --> 11:08.840
I'm gonna tell the captain
that your bag's ticking.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.778
Then you'll have a situation.

11:10.837 --> 11:11.838
Good night.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.536
Have a seat.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.212
I'm Bernice Deagan, director of

11:43.336 --> 11:45.247
the Golden Quill
National Spelling Bee.

11:46.639 --> 11:47.879
Struthious.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.077
What did she say?

11:50.176 --> 11:52.520
S-T-R-U-T-H-I-O-U-S. Struthious.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.551
That was my winning word. Oh.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.720
1973, national champion.

11:59.852 --> 12:01.889
Just thought you should know
that in case you didn't already.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.262
No, I didn't.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.733
Did you know that? No, I didn't.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.701
Guy, I don't like you.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.329
Look... Quiet.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.497
You know, when I
was a little girl,

12:11.598 --> 12:13.544
I was always picked last in P.E.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.912
I hated sports. That's
what probably thankfully

12:17.003 --> 12:18.539
thrusted me into the
welcoming bosom

12:18.671 --> 12:20.241
of the spelling bee, of
which I am the director.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.081
Have been for over 20 years now.

12:22.175 --> 12:25.452
How did I accomplish that?
Elbow grease? Yes.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.389
Hard work? Maybe. Integrity?
Oh, you betcha.

12:29.215 --> 12:32.389
But what I didn't do is use slimy
gimmicks, as you have done.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.762
Well, you don't know me and
you don't know why I'm here.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.299
Would you like to tell me?

12:36.389 --> 12:37.561
No, thank you.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.467
Do you know why he's here?

12:39.559 --> 12:42.472
Oh, I have been
trying for weeks.

12:42.562 --> 12:46.305
All right. Well, whatever issue
it is you're hereto workout,

12:46.399 --> 12:48.879
perhaps a painful 5th
grade spelling bee or...

12:48.935 --> 12:50.539
It's not that. Not asking.

12:51.037 --> 12:53.540
I'm simply telling you
you're in the wrong place.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.378
No, this is the spot.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.148
I'm gonna be out of your
hair in three days, though.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.312
Perhaps sooner.

12:59.412 --> 13:00.982
Because however smart
you think you are,

13:01.080 --> 13:02.957
with this loophole
you're snaking through,

13:03.049 --> 13:06.121
I'll bet you're not half as smart
<i>as</i> even our worst speller.

13:06.219 --> 13:10.292
So B-R-A-V-O, Mr. Trilby.
You've made it.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.801
That one I know. That's "bravo."

13:14.060 --> 13:15.733
All the way to your own hanging.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.272
Okay. Your noose. Enjoy.

13:19.265 --> 13:22.474
Can I ask you a question?
On your wife's birthday,

13:22.568 --> 13:23.774
does she get to
wear the strap-on,

13:23.836 --> 13:26.146
or do you hog that thing 365?

13:26.272 --> 13:28.445
That's yours, right? You hold onto that.
Good day.

13:28.574 --> 13:31.248
You don't share that with anybody.
Yeah. Good day.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.481
I thank you very much.

13:33.579 --> 13:35.183
You can thank Dr. Bowman.

13:35.281 --> 13:37.090
He was very disappointed
he couldn't

13:37.250 --> 13:39.025
personally place that
around your throat.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.291
Yeah? Is he busy
doing somethin' else

13:41.421 --> 13:43.628
more pleasurable with
another guy's throat?

13:43.690 --> 13:46.671
He is in the middle of a very
important media training session.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.432
Surely you're aware
that your little stunt

13:48.494 --> 13:49.837
has landed on the
very first year

13:49.929 --> 13:51.499
we're televising
this tournament?

13:51.597 --> 13:54.669
Hang on. That is a coincidence.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.975
It doesn't bother you
that a few million people

13:58.037 --> 13:59.846
will witness your embarrassment?

13:59.939 --> 14:01.350
I'm not gonna be the
one with the red face.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.318
Trust me. Not here for that.

14:04.811 --> 14:07.485
Okey.-

14:08.514 --> 14:09.549
See you later.

14:10.216 --> 14:11.217
Oh!

14:11.317 --> 14:13.854
And I personally arranged
your hotel accommodations.

14:13.953 --> 14:15.113
I'll bet they're not awesome.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.191
They're not.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.497
Nice meeting you.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.222
<i>I had plenty of opportunities
to stop what I was doing.</i>

14:26.666 --> 14:27.872
<i>To make a good decision.</i>

14:29.035 --> 14:32.847
<i>But that would have required the kind
of lessons that I was never taught.</i>

14:35.208 --> 14:38.155
Oh, there's an ice cream
social at 5:30 P.M.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.052
You gonna be there?

14:41.147 --> 14:43.821
Okay. No. Well, I could
be pretty late to that.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.057
Really late? Super late.

14:46.753 --> 14:47.823
Meet me there, though.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.560
Here's your key, Mr.
Trilby. Thank you.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.657
And, ma'am, I'll be
right back with yours.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.704
Oh, bummer. See you.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.671
Hold the door!

15:00.166 --> 15:01.167
Whew!

15:01.534 --> 15:03.172
Hey, we're both on two.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.611
Did you remember
your winning word?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.080
I'm Chaitanya, remember?

15:10.176 --> 15:11.917
I can't do it again, Shawarma.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.081
Chaitanya.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.758
How about just your
favorite word?

15:16.849 --> 15:18.419
I'm serious, pal.

15:18.851 --> 15:21.297
You don't have one? I don't.
No. Sorry.

15:22.522 --> 15:26.197
Mine is "subjugate." it just
sounds so cool, you know?

15:26.592 --> 15:30.096
Subjugate. Subjugate.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.535
Subjugate.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.212
What's yours?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.474
Can it be "Shut the fuck up"?

15:38.304 --> 15:40.614
Well, that's four words.
A sentence, really.

15:41.541 --> 15:42.918
Pretend you're on
a desert island,

15:43.042 --> 15:44.453
and this gorilla comes
out of the jungle

15:44.544 --> 15:46.148
and holds a gun to
your head and says,

15:46.279 --> 15:47.917
"Hoo! Hoo! Tell me what
your favorite word is!"

15:48.047 --> 15:49.082
What would you say?

15:49.148 --> 15:50.650
Sweet fuck. You've got
a gorilla with a gun?

15:50.750 --> 15:51.956
Yeah, a gorilla with a gun.

15:52.051 --> 15:53.172
And he's on a desert island?

15:53.286 --> 15:54.390
He's standing right there!

15:54.454 --> 15:56.400
Here's what I'd do. I'd kick
some sand in the monkey's face,

15:56.456 --> 15:58.663
I'd take his gun and hunt you
down, I'd stick it in your mouth,

15:58.758 --> 16:00.294
and I'd tell you to stop trying

16:00.426 --> 16:01.962
to get all up in
my kitchen, kid!

16:02.061 --> 16:04.974
Again, that's a sentence.
We can finish that later'

16:05.064 --> 16:06.566
Bye-bye.

16:18.845 --> 16:19.983
Come on.

16:20.079 --> 16:23.322
Unfortunately, the hotel
is completely sold out.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.123
I don't have a bathroom.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.028
Yeah.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.000
Where would the hotel like
me to put my piss and shit?

16:50.176 --> 16:52.019
Bartender? Yes, ma'am.

16:52.111 --> 16:53.522
Do you know how to
make an Old Fashioned?

16:53.613 --> 16:54.990
Sure.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.450
Actually, make that two.

17:01.787 --> 17:03.198
No mini-bar, huh?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.799
They've got me in
a storage closet.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.196
I think the queen bee is
sending you a message.

17:10.229 --> 17:11.708
Whatever.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.410
God.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.035
Look at all the
parents around here.

17:18.804 --> 17:21.751
Like bursting at the
seams with parents.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.354
Here you go.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.354
Where are your parents?
Thank you.

17:26.412 --> 17:29.655
Jenny, come on. I just want to
have a drink in peace. Okay?

17:29.715 --> 17:32.389
And can I give you a little
journalistic advice?

17:32.485 --> 17:33.896
Don't try so hard.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.727
Okay, I'm gonna talk.
We're here three days.

17:35.821 --> 17:39.496
It's difficult to talk when
you're being smothered.

17:40.826 --> 17:44.672
You're like an insolent child
hiding secrets from his mommy.

17:45.164 --> 17:49.510
Really? You're not half the
broad my mother was. Or is.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.712
Cheers.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.546
A seat opened up.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.350
I don't want to talk and
I don't want the drink.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.861
I'm dead serious. Either
you leave or I'm going to.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.865
Or you could stay. I could
buy you yet another dinner.

18:08.921 --> 18:09.922
No.

18:10.022 --> 18:14.061
We could expand on this three measly
answers you've given me thus far.

18:14.126 --> 18:15.935
You know too much already.

18:16.028 --> 18:19.874
Do I? Let's see here.
Hold on a second.

18:21.801 --> 18:26.375
Okay. Wild Turkey,
olive green and 32-A.

18:27.473 --> 18:32.388
Favorite drink, color and breast
size are first date questions.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.255
But maybe you've never
been on one of those.

18:35.314 --> 18:38.625
Can you leave me alone? I've asked
you four or five times now.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.664
Why don't you tell me why
you're so angry at the world'?

18:40.753 --> 18:45.725
Just... Come on. Go ahead.
Screw. Please?

18:53.265 --> 18:54.300
Screw?

18:54.667 --> 18:56.169
Screw.

18:56.268 --> 18:58.646
Take off. Hit it.

18:58.738 --> 19:02.151
Did you just tire of
the words "fuck off“?"

19:02.241 --> 19:05.120
Because I know you're not suggesting
that I let you fuck me again.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.859
First of all, you're welcome.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.362
Umm. If you'd like
me to consider

19:13.452 --> 19:16.524
another, uh, event with you,

19:16.622 --> 19:18.329
you can ask me nicely.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.834
And secondly, "fuck
off“ works just great",

19:22.928 --> 19:23.968
if that's what you prefer.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.033
Does that sound better to you'?

19:26.766 --> 19:28.768
Or does "screw"
sound pretty nice?

19:30.770 --> 19:31.771
Oh, yeah.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.940
Yeah. Yeah.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.285
Yeah. Don't look at me.

19:45.951 --> 19:47.055
What? Don't look at me.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.496
Okey.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.128
Ooh, yeah! Yeah!

19:51.223 --> 19:52.964
Do not look at me. Okay.

19:53.793 --> 19:54.863
Do not look at me.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.303
You're fuckin' staring
at me, you know.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.534
It's kind of creepy.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.371
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.545
Oh, yup! yup! yup! Yup! Yup!

20:01.634 --> 20:03.841
Don't look at me! Don't look at me!
Don't look at me.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.911
Now I have to start again.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.815
I'm sorry. Lost it. Lost it.
I understand. Okay, okay.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.319
So we could be here all night.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.855
Build it up. Okay.

20:12.812 --> 20:13.847
Climbing a mountain.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.358
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.655
Got it? One foot in
front of the other.

20:20.352 --> 20:24.061
Okay. Now we're joggin'.
Now we're joggin'.

20:25.191 --> 20:26.397
Who wants to run?

20:26.492 --> 20:27.732
Don't look at me!

20:27.827 --> 20:29.272
Do you want me to
grab your balls?

20:29.361 --> 20:30.567
Do you want me to stick my
finger in your asshole?

20:30.663 --> 20:31.835
Shut the fuck up!

20:35.167 --> 20:36.168
Oh!

20:39.438 --> 20:40.781
Don't look at me!

20:43.509 --> 20:46.080
Wow. Okay.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.419
Second time, shame on me.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.790
I had a good time, too. Thanks.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.528
So if I need fresh
towels in the morning,

20:54.687 --> 20:56.030
I should just put
my name on this?

20:59.258 --> 21:02.262
Okay. Well, I'll see you
tomorrow, or whatever...

21:03.062 --> 21:04.632
Bye.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.627
You know, if you really
had it all together,

21:30.756 --> 21:32.929
you wouldn't be leavin' your...

21:32.992 --> 21:35.973
Sorry to bother you, but the
lady said you were still awake.

21:36.061 --> 21:38.234
Would you mind helping me
open this jar of pretzels?

21:39.899 --> 21:42.243
Wow. Small room.

21:44.670 --> 21:48.345
Can you help me? I haven't had
anything to eat all night.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.640
I was studying my words so hard

21:49.675 --> 21:50.779
that I missed room
service hours,

21:50.843 --> 21:53.585
and this jar's too
hard for me to open.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.691
Are you opening it now
or have you taken it?

22:05.524 --> 22:07.435
Great. Thanks.

22:08.260 --> 22:11.173
I was also wondering if you
wanted to be my friend.

22:11.263 --> 22:13.004
Why would I want to be
friends with a 9-year-old'?

22:13.098 --> 22:15.476
Ten, but okay, that's cool.

22:16.435 --> 22:19.041
I just thought it would be fun to
study together before tomorrow.

22:19.471 --> 22:21.781
Drink soda pop from the
mini-bar and stuff.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.655
You got a mini-bar in there?
I do.

22:26.612 --> 22:27.613
What about Mom and Dad?

22:27.680 --> 22:30.627
My dad believes I should
learn how to be my own man.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.994
And that means staying in my own
hotel room myself this weekend.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.401
So he's just staying in a
different room down here, is he?

22:38.724 --> 22:41.830
He's staying at a fancier
hotel a few blocks away.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.634
Nice guy.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.870
it's kind of neat. I get to jump
on the bed as much as I want.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.310
But tonight I messed up
and missed room service.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.572
Have you named your binder?

22:52.671 --> 22:54.378
Yes. Todd.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.821
He has all the words I've
ever memorized in there.

22:57.877 --> 22:58.981
And their origins.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.053
Todd's my key to success.

23:02.147 --> 23:05.026
I think I've spent more hours
with Todd than even my parents.

23:05.584 --> 23:08.656
He's cool and he's smart, and
that's why I named him Todd.

23:09.321 --> 23:10.595
No, that makes sense.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.038
Have you figured out
your favorite word?

23:15.160 --> 23:16.867
No, I sure haven't.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.036
Is it the "F" word?

23:19.999 --> 23:21.239
It's up there.

23:21.333 --> 23:22.676
Because you say it a lot.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.271
Everyone should.

23:24.370 --> 23:27.544
Not me. My father
says bad words.

23:27.606 --> 23:29.017
What about your dad?

23:29.174 --> 23:32.018
Never met him. But my mom
said bad words a lot.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.023
And you can say bad words.
Who gives a shit?

23:34.413 --> 23:36.017
I shouldn't.
Why not?

23:36.081 --> 23:37.219
You should just say
what you feel.

23:37.283 --> 23:38.728
That's what they're there for.
Why don't you try one?

23:39.184 --> 23:41.460
I feel the opposite of
bad-wordy right now.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.759
Will you just say something
bad, you fuckin' Quaker?

23:45.357 --> 23:46.358
Umm...

23:47.860 --> 23:48.930
Motherfucker?

23:49.028 --> 23:51.531
Great. Perfect.
That's a good one.

23:51.630 --> 23:53.974
And did your soul burst
into flames? No.

23:54.199 --> 23:56.076
Nope. I'm okay.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.709
You're a little weirdo.
You know that?

24:19.058 --> 24:20.230
Hey. Hey.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.096
It's morning.

24:23.162 --> 24:26.109
You passed out last night and
I was scared to wake you.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.304
My dad will be here any minute.
You should go.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.811
Okey.-

24:35.240 --> 24:36.776
You sleep good, dickhead?

24:41.747 --> 24:43.867
So what do you want to
know about this morning?

24:44.416 --> 24:46.293
Uh, nothing unless
it's really important.

24:46.352 --> 24:49.026
Oh, you're gonna be seated
next to Braden Aftergood.

24:49.121 --> 24:50.532
He comes from bee royalty.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.967
Consider me warned. Oh, good,
because he is awesome.

24:53.659 --> 24:54.660
Is he? Yeah.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.000
Is he a great speller?

24:56.095 --> 24:58.632
Did I leave my underpants
in your room last night?

24:58.697 --> 25:01.473
As a matter of fact, you...

25:01.533 --> 25:02.533
I don't know.

25:02.601 --> 25:04.103
Would you look for me' please?

25:04.169 --> 25:05.250
I only brought three pairs.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.045
I probably would have
seen them, Jenny.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.947
My room has no sink,
shower or toilet.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.321
Score one for Deagan.

25:11.377 --> 25:13.618
You know, you can put
me on the board, too.

25:18.951 --> 25:22.125
Obviously, if I could figure
out a way to be less stubborn,

25:22.187 --> 25:24.667
the right way to fix things
would be easier to see.

25:24.790 --> 25:26.133
Window! Window! You
take that one.

25:26.291 --> 25:27.634
Yes.

26:22.514 --> 26:23.584
Pretty impressive.

26:23.682 --> 26:25.958
All right, everybody, we're
going live in five minutes.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.929
Excuse me. Press? Click and Scroll?
Uh, yes.

26:29.621 --> 26:30.895
Yeah, I understand all that.

26:30.956 --> 26:33.402
Here's the randomized
list for this round.

26:33.459 --> 26:36.906
Do me a favor and
enunciate this year.

26:38.697 --> 26:41.371
Well, look who's here.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.547
Can you hook it on your
chair or something?

26:43.602 --> 26:45.240
Thanks. Good luck.

26:45.804 --> 26:47.306
I'm a contestant, buddy.

26:50.209 --> 26:51.552
How you doin'?

26:52.744 --> 26:55.088
Can we get them to sit
down, please, ma'am?

26:55.881 --> 26:57.053
Hey, Guy!

26:57.616 --> 26:59.425
Oh, look who's here. Hi.

27:03.222 --> 27:05.930
Where's me? Is this me?
Excuse me.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.447
Welcome, everyone, to the 111th.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.816
Annual Golden Quill
National Spelling Bee.

27:25.911 --> 27:30.417
I'm Pete Fowler coming to you live
from historic Figueroa Auditorium

27:30.482 --> 27:32.826
here in sunny Los
Angeles, California.

27:32.918 --> 27:34.955
This year marks the first year

27:35.020 --> 27:37.261
that the Golden Quill has
been nationally televised,

27:37.322 --> 27:40.633
and we can think of no better
captain for such a maiden voyage

27:40.692 --> 27:44.003
than the President of the
Quill Institute itself.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.337
Welcome to your tournament,
Professor William Bowman.

27:46.431 --> 27:48.104
Or should I say Dr. Bowman?

27:48.934 --> 27:51.608
It all depends on whether
you're sick or confused.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.774
Otherwise, just Bill.

27:53.705 --> 27:55.810
Well, let's get
started, shall we'?

27:55.874 --> 27:59.287
We have all 50 competitors in the
room, and we're ready to begin.

27:59.344 --> 28:02.291
Our first competitor
is Ling Quan.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.951
Ling says that
when she grows up,

28:04.016 --> 28:06.056
she would like to be President
of the United States.

28:06.151 --> 28:08.688
Making it your fourth to reach
the office, would it not?

28:08.787 --> 28:10.858
It would. Best of luck, Ling.

28:12.958 --> 28:14.301
Dactylogram.

28:14.893 --> 28:16.201
Dactylogram?

28:17.129 --> 28:18.130
Dactylogram.

28:18.964 --> 28:20.500
Dactylogram.

28:22.634 --> 28:23.874
Dactylogram.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.539
Can I have the
definition, please?

28:29.374 --> 28:31.183
"A fingerprint."

28:32.544 --> 28:34.023
Dactylogram.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.649
Can I have the origin, please?

28:37.249 --> 28:40.753
From a Greek combination
dactylos...

28:40.852 --> 28:44.664
I'm Guy. And you're Braden, right'?
Braden Aftergood?

28:46.425 --> 28:48.427
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

28:49.494 --> 28:50.598
Why not?

28:50.996 --> 28:52.236
Because my dad says

28:52.331 --> 28:54.743
you're probably just
some unemployed bum

28:54.833 --> 28:57.245
trying to steal the prize
money that I deserve,

28:57.402 --> 28:58.938
and that you're a cheater.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.844
He said that, huh?

29:04.910 --> 29:06.355
He did.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.579
It is a noun.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.605
Can you tell your dad that I don't
blame him for being so angry?

29:16.021 --> 29:18.023
And then can you do
me another favor?

29:18.123 --> 29:20.103
Can you give these
to your mother?

29:20.192 --> 29:22.468
She left those in
my room last night.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.438
I would do it myself,
but your dad is here,

29:24.563 --> 29:26.406
and we've already
covered his mood.

29:26.465 --> 29:29.275
I don't want to kick the nest.
Do you know what I mean?

29:30.469 --> 29:33.279
Buddy, good luck with that divorce.
They get so nasty.

29:33.705 --> 29:35.116
What are you talking about?

29:35.207 --> 29:38.552
I'm talking about probably a
very dysfunctional marriage.

29:38.610 --> 29:39.987
I'm glad I was there for her.

29:40.078 --> 29:42.319
It's just animal
instinct, you know?

29:43.782 --> 29:46.558
She can't help it. Shes just human.
Okay?

29:46.818 --> 29:49.492
And she was very sweet I
want you to know that.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.998
She held me afterwards.
A nice woman.

29:54.393 --> 29:55.838
That is correct. Hey!

29:58.997 --> 30:00.237
You're up, dawg.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.472
Poised, intelligent.

30:02.567 --> 30:04.274
She's got my vote.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.405
Next, we have probably
one of this year's

30:06.571 --> 30:08.608
strongest competitors,
Braden Aftergood.

30:08.674 --> 30:11.120
And that reminds me, my
very first spelling bee,

30:11.176 --> 30:13.315
I had my lucky bottle
cap in my back pocket.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.517
Looks like he's got his
good luck hankie there.

30:17.749 --> 30:18.921
Noctivagant.

30:22.754 --> 30:26.099
I'm sorry. Uh, definition?

30:27.626 --> 30:29.435
Going about in the night.

30:29.795 --> 30:31.138
Night wandering.

30:36.201 --> 30:40.616
Um, noctivagant. Wait. Can
you use it in a sentence?

30:42.274 --> 30:44.481
The noctivagant alley cat

30:45.010 --> 30:47.854
kept the entire
neighborhood up all night

30:48.513 --> 30:53.462
by sitting on a fence, yowling
out to her many suitors.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.000
Noctivagant.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.803
Okay. Noctivagant.

31:05.964 --> 31:08.308
N-O-c-

31:09.067 --> 31:13.311
T-I-V-I-G-A-N-T.

31:13.672 --> 31:15.151
Noctivagant.

31:19.411 --> 31:20.685
Well, we have our
first elimination

31:20.746 --> 31:21.884
of the tournament.
I'll be right back.

31:21.980 --> 31:23.740
Yes, and surprisingly
early, too.

31:23.815 --> 31:25.488
Next up is Mr. Guy Trilby.

31:25.550 --> 31:28.156
He's 40 years old, lives
in Columbus, Ohio.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.564
Clearly, Mr. Trilby
has found a loophole

31:30.655 --> 31:32.862
in your rules of entry
and is exploiting it.

31:32.924 --> 31:35.404
Needless to say, this
is beyond unfortunate.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.906
My staff and I are making
all the efforts necessary

31:37.996 --> 31:39.498
to rectify the problem

31:39.564 --> 31:42.408
for the tournaments in
the years that follow.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.572
With that addressed, on
with the competition.

31:44.669 --> 31:46.444
And the man himself, Guy Trilby.

31:47.839 --> 31:49.250
My turn.

31:50.175 --> 31:51.518
Frabjous.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.691
F-R-A-B-J-O-U-S.

31:56.948 --> 31:58.086
That is correct.

32:04.356 --> 32:06.563
Thank you. That's enough!

32:06.625 --> 32:08.536
Listen! Listen!

32:08.593 --> 32:10.595
We are doing all we can

32:10.695 --> 32:12.766
to find a happy resolution
to this situation.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.036
Aren't you embarrassed?

32:14.099 --> 32:15.942
This is gonna go down in history

32:16.067 --> 32:17.944
as the most ridiculous
spelling bee ever!

32:18.036 --> 32:20.983
And it's gonna be on your head!
He's a grown man!

32:21.072 --> 32:24.076
Do you know how much money I've
spent on goddamned coaches?

32:24.209 --> 32:25.449
I'm sure it's a lot.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.217
A ton! He's a lunatic!

32:27.379 --> 32:29.052
Yes, he is. So fix it!

32:29.481 --> 32:32.223
Or I swear on my child's life,
with God as my witness,

32:32.551 --> 32:35.088
this will be the last year
you're the director of this bee.

32:35.153 --> 32:36.673
All right, there's
no need for threats.

32:36.721 --> 32:38.962
Now, if you can all please
just leave my office,

32:39.057 --> 32:42.971
I can assure you this matter
is in very capable hands.

32:43.061 --> 32:46.133
Now, keep in mind Mr. Trilby doesn't
have the discipline and practice

32:46.231 --> 32:47.801
that all of your children have.

32:47.899 --> 32:50.470
He's made it through
the first round.

32:50.569 --> 32:53.175
But Dr. Bowman and I are
extremely confident

32:53.271 --> 32:55.012
he's not going to
make it much farther.

32:55.240 --> 32:58.813
And I also swear on
your children's lives,

32:58.910 --> 33:00.685
if he makes it to
the final round,

33:00.779 --> 33:04.317
I'll step down <i>as</i> director of
the bee immediately. Good day.

33:12.591 --> 33:15.265
I'll jump in your shower as
soon as this buzz kicks in.

33:20.265 --> 33:21.676
Hey, let me ask you a question.

33:22.434 --> 33:25.347
What's the grammatical
significance of the sentence,

33:25.437 --> 33:27.713
"Why run from fire ants?"

33:31.710 --> 33:32.882
Is this a test?

33:32.978 --> 33:34.889
No. It's just...

33:34.980 --> 33:36.220
I was wondering what
the grammatical

33:36.348 --> 33:37.554
significance of
that sentence was.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.959
"Why run from fire ants?"

33:40.118 --> 33:42.120
Ah, well, every
vowel is in there.

33:43.555 --> 33:44.795
Starting with the going to the.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.167
Right? It's backwards.

33:47.225 --> 33:50.172
I guess it's easy
for a sentence.

33:50.228 --> 33:54.540
I wish there was one word that
had all the vowels in it.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.408
But in alphabetical order.

33:57.802 --> 33:58.837
Facetious.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.040
Son of a bitch.

34:00.138 --> 34:01.378
I got it? You're brilliant.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.043
Give me another one.
You're a genius.

34:03.141 --> 34:05.348
These questions are from a test
that they give to geniuses.

34:05.410 --> 34:07.913
I got hold of your school
records, Guy Trilby,

34:08.246 --> 34:11.693
and your 8th grade counselor
made a note on your file

34:11.815 --> 34:13.226
just before you dropped out...
Let me see that.

34:13.318 --> 34:15.491
Saying that you showed
signs of being a genius.

34:15.987 --> 34:18.991
FedEx was waiting for me when I got here.
I told you I was good.

34:19.056 --> 34:21.594
Mr. Leavenworth,
what a dick eater.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.001
He told me I was
a useless loser,

34:23.061 --> 34:26.167
and then he makes secret notes
saying that he thinks I'm smart?

34:28.233 --> 34:30.679
I'm glad I stole his
bike and shaved his cat.

34:31.235 --> 34:34.239
You just never had a chance
to shine in this school.

34:34.339 --> 34:35.750
You just never had a
chance to realize it.

34:35.840 --> 34:39.117
I had a shitty upbringing.
My dad wasn't around.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.690
It goes on and on and on. Who
skated through their adolescence?

34:41.846 --> 34:42.847
Where was your father?

34:42.947 --> 34:43.949
I don't know.

34:45.684 --> 34:48.290
You got somethin' there?
Where's your pen?

34:48.386 --> 34:50.866
Maybe he was brilliant.
Maybe your mom was.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.594
Because they say that
sometimes that brilliance

34:52.690 --> 34:54.568
and photographic memory, which
you have, are inherited.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.969
It didn't come from Mom. She hated
everything to do with education.

34:57.062 --> 34:58.132
This one time when I was a kid,

34:58.229 --> 35:00.629
I tried to get in this local
spelling bee, ironically enough,

35:00.699 --> 35:02.542
and she burned my
favorite dictionary.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.808
Is that why you're here?
A chance to do something

35:04.903 --> 35:07.042
that you weren't able to
do while she was alive?

35:07.105 --> 35:09.107
Are we in interview mode now?
Come on.

35:09.207 --> 35:10.709
You can't just have a
normal conversation.

35:10.775 --> 35:11.981
You've gotta turn everything
into the interview.

35:12.077 --> 35:13.454
I'm a reporter.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.047
So, can't you talk, too?

35:15.280 --> 35:18.159
You know what? You have
problems, Guy Trilby.

35:18.249 --> 35:20.991
You're a shrink, too? Right? A
shrink on top of being a reporter?

35:21.086 --> 35:22.486
I don't know how you
cram it all in.

35:22.554 --> 35:23.794
And you're the one
with the problem.

35:23.888 --> 35:26.926
You have to be blindfolded to get off.
That's a problem.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.800
Oh! Well, don't worry
about that, Guy!

35:29.894 --> 35:31.567
Because that's never
gonna happen again!

35:31.630 --> 35:32.631
Great. Oh!

35:32.731 --> 35:33.732
Yeah, great!

35:33.798 --> 35:34.799
You promise?

35:34.899 --> 35:38.403
I wouldn't let you near my vagina
again if you paid me $1 million!

35:38.803 --> 35:39.804
Don't look at me!

35:39.938 --> 35:40.973
Yeah...

35:42.073 --> 35:44.917
Can you be quiet? Your
voice eats hard-ans.

35:44.976 --> 35:48.082
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, really.
Let me apologize.

35:48.179 --> 35:51.956
Okay. Oh! Okay! You are sorry.

35:52.751 --> 35:53.821
That's generous.

35:53.918 --> 35:55.329
Uh-huh? Uh-huh!

35:55.954 --> 35:57.865
Hang on. This make it easier?

35:57.956 --> 35:59.492
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

35:59.591 --> 36:00.763
I'm gonna hold still.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.361
That makes it easier, right'?

36:02.460 --> 36:06.374
Don't look at me. I get it. I get it.
Don't look at me.

36:10.468 --> 36:12.175
Did you get locked out?

36:12.270 --> 36:14.181
I was wondering if
you wanted to grab

36:14.305 --> 36:16.285
some alimentation for
our hyperphagia.

36:16.441 --> 36:17.647
I'm hungry.

36:17.709 --> 36:21.452
Oh, I just got pretty hungry myself.
Sure, let's go for it.

36:21.613 --> 36:22.785
Can't believe you
can't find any other

36:22.947 --> 36:24.051
pre-masturbators
to hang out with.

36:24.149 --> 36:25.492
The place is crawlin' with them.

36:25.550 --> 36:28.121
You know, you can actually study
for the spelling bee anywhere.

36:28.286 --> 36:30.459
Thank you. Is that right?

36:31.690 --> 36:34.364
Try spelling "rigatoni"
without looking.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.497
I don't want to. I
don't need to study.

36:36.561 --> 36:38.302
You need to study
because I'm gonna

36:38.363 --> 36:40.365
slaughter you like a sacred cow.

36:40.465 --> 36:42.206
Not everything is about winning.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.177
No, that's true. Closure
is pretty nice, too.

36:45.303 --> 36:46.976
To me, it's about fun.

36:48.506 --> 36:50.179
You probably deserve a
little bit better than that.

36:50.241 --> 36:51.413
Excuse me.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.086
I'm the mother of one of the
competitors competing here.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.351
Okay. What you're doing

36:56.481 --> 36:59.257
is an insult to
every honest child

36:59.350 --> 37:03.321
that's worked so hard to
be here, including my son.

37:04.989 --> 37:06.434
I've worked very, very
hard to get here, too,

37:06.558 --> 37:08.003
madam, and I'm well
within the rules.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.437
You're an asshole. That's all.

37:11.596 --> 37:13.166
That's a child. Yes.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.745
And I'm sure he's heard
even worse from you.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.395
I don't speak like
that in front of him.

37:17.502 --> 37:19.948
Oh, is that right?
Yes, that's right.

37:20.605 --> 37:22.881
So why don't you take
your potty mouth,

37:22.941 --> 37:25.421
go locate your pre-teen
cocksucker son,

37:25.510 --> 37:26.887
and stuff him back up that old,

37:27.011 --> 37:28.422
blown-out sweat sock of a vagina

37:28.513 --> 37:30.720
and scoot off to whatever
shit-kicking town you came from.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.386
Can you do that for me?

37:34.352 --> 37:36.025
Like an elephants
trunk, I'll bet.

37:38.123 --> 37:40.433
Gray and distended. Wow.

37:41.893 --> 37:42.963
Good night. Good day.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.301
Thank you.

37:46.364 --> 37:47.399
Mothers.

37:48.199 --> 37:49.479
Let's get out of
this restaurant.

37:49.567 --> 37:50.875
It's a little depressing,
don't you think?

37:50.935 --> 37:53.245
My dad doesn't ever allow
me to leave the hotel.

37:53.304 --> 37:56.114
Daddy's not here, and he sounds
like he could be an asshole,

37:56.207 --> 38:00.155
so let's not listen to him. Let's go
find you some real fun. Side door.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.714
I'm glad I was in town
to catch your call.

40:12.610 --> 40:15.386
You look really, really good.

40:15.446 --> 40:16.618
I appreciate that

40:16.714 --> 40:19.718
I've been stayin' away from sugar.
Cold Turkey.

40:19.784 --> 40:23.527
Wow. Do you feel as
good as you look?

40:23.588 --> 40:26.899
Are you happy? How's federal
agent life treating you'?

40:26.958 --> 40:29.097
You know, it's not as
fun as it used to be.

40:29.193 --> 40:33.141
Yeah, I kind of miss you digging
around where you shouldn't be.

40:33.231 --> 40:35.268
On...

40:35.366 --> 40:37.107
Yeah. Yeah.

40:37.201 --> 40:38.407
So there you go.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.644
That's one background
check on one Guy Trilby.

40:41.739 --> 40:43.548
Thank you.

40:45.476 --> 40:47.888
Is this for a story
or something?

40:50.381 --> 40:52.292
Something good?

40:55.586 --> 40:56.792
Did you do this
background run yourself?

40:56.921 --> 40:58.127
Of course I did.

40:58.222 --> 41:00.099
What kind of a guy repays
a favor by delegating it?

41:00.158 --> 41:01.569
I did it. Wow.

41:02.894 --> 41:06.467
This is incredible.
Thank you so much.

41:08.066 --> 41:09.909
So is that it?

41:11.235 --> 41:13.476
Oh, yeah. This is huge.

41:13.571 --> 41:14.845
That's a relief. I'll tell you,

41:14.939 --> 41:16.475
this has been hangin'
over my head for years,

41:16.574 --> 41:19.248
and I'm the kind of guy, I like
to keep a debt-free lifestyle.

41:19.344 --> 41:22.154
Well, consider yourself
free and clear. Yeah.

41:22.246 --> 41:24.453
I just expected to have to
do so much more, you know'?

41:24.582 --> 41:26.789
It seems like it's not enough.
No.

41:26.918 --> 41:30.195
You saved my ass, my career.
Well...

41:30.288 --> 41:32.268
Feel like I'm gettin' off easy.
No.

41:32.323 --> 41:35.429
You know, you did me a solid.

41:35.760 --> 41:38.297
No, we're square.

41:38.529 --> 41:40.202
You don't want anything
more in return?

41:40.298 --> 41:41.504
Uh-uh.

41:41.766 --> 41:43.609
You don't want anything...

41:46.504 --> 41:47.949
Solid...

41:51.676 --> 41:53.280
In return?

41:58.116 --> 41:59.652
No.

42:01.452 --> 42:03.022
Are you familiar
with the phrase.

42:03.121 --> 42:04.191
"Eatin' ain't cheatin”?"

42:04.288 --> 42:05.460
Thanks so much, Jeremy.

42:05.556 --> 42:07.467
It's a popular phrase.

42:08.793 --> 42:11.239
Aren't these fries incredible?

42:11.329 --> 42:12.808
And was I right about the chili?

42:12.864 --> 42:14.502
Love it.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.808
You might want to slow
down a little bit, Slummy.

42:16.901 --> 42:19.347
Looks like you got into the
wrong dude's ass. Here.

42:19.504 --> 42:20.505
Ha!

42:21.005 --> 42:22.040
Funny.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.402
You look like there was a person
who pooped their underwear,

42:26.577 --> 42:28.557
then you used it for
a bank robber mask.

42:28.646 --> 42:30.207
Then you threw the
pooped underwear away

42:30.248 --> 42:32.194
and forgot to wash your face.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.344
You shouldn't insult people.
You're no good at it.

42:37.422 --> 42:39.333
This soda pop is so delicious.

42:39.824 --> 42:42.202
Then just say "soda." Otherwise
you're gonna get raped.

42:44.195 --> 42:45.765
I like having you as a friend.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.171
Thanks.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.236
Although I'm not your friend.

42:52.336 --> 42:54.213
You got friends. I'm
four times your age.

42:54.272 --> 42:55.945
I really don't have any friends.

42:56.207 --> 42:58.517
I thought being good in
spelling would get me friends,

42:58.576 --> 43:00.351
but kids just make
fun of me more.

43:02.013 --> 43:04.118
Well, who needs them?
You've got Todd, right?

43:04.682 --> 43:06.423
And you' too, maybe, huh?

43:07.285 --> 43:09.629
No. Buddy, I work alone.

43:10.354 --> 43:12.356
Always have. My mom
always kept me

43:12.423 --> 43:14.596
running around with
her, avoiding rent.

43:14.692 --> 43:17.298
I never gathered a bunch
of friends, so...

43:19.697 --> 43:21.870
And it's fine. It's good.
You'll be all right.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.318
What's that?

43:35.413 --> 43:37.222
I borrowed it when we
borrowed the lobster.

43:38.816 --> 43:40.989
Really? Let me see it.

43:44.055 --> 43:46.934
Your fingers get a little sticky
when you get all boozed up.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.903
Toys are fun to have when you
can't play with other kids.

43:52.597 --> 43:54.304
That's true.

43:54.398 --> 43:56.571
What was your favorite
toy when you were a kid?

43:58.803 --> 44:02.808
Well, I did love a little toy
car once, kind of like this.

44:02.907 --> 44:05.353
It was a shitty little
black-and-white police car.

44:05.443 --> 44:07.445
Never left my pocket.

44:08.179 --> 44:09.920
Then I lost it one
night, I think.

44:09.981 --> 44:12.086
I don't know. I must have
dropped it or somethin'

44:12.250 --> 44:14.321
and I never saw it again.

44:16.320 --> 44:20.666
Had a little Kojak
light right on top.

44:20.758 --> 44:22.999
Right there, a little
single bubble.

44:24.595 --> 44:26.939
Chasin' down bad guys.

44:35.606 --> 44:37.517
All right. So you're
a little thief,

44:37.642 --> 44:39.553
and you don't have any friends.

44:39.644 --> 44:40.987
You sound like a real loser.

44:41.045 --> 44:42.649
I'll bet you crush
ass, though, right?

44:42.713 --> 44:44.852
Make up for it with the women?

44:44.949 --> 44:46.189
No.

44:46.684 --> 44:49.893
No girlfriend for you? You
can't find one little

44:50.021 --> 44:54.163
chicken tikka to get your
shrimp tandoori all up in?

44:54.225 --> 44:56.796
Nope. But when I do get one,

44:56.861 --> 44:58.397
it's going to be a
girl with nipples.

44:58.863 --> 45:01.537
Is that right? Well, lucky for
you, they all have nipples, pal.

45:01.632 --> 45:03.737
Every girl does not have nipples.
No.

45:03.834 --> 45:05.472
They do. No, they don't.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.038
Buddy, I promise you, they do.

45:07.138 --> 45:08.139
They don't.

45:08.206 --> 45:11.153
All right. I don't know
how I missed that.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.211
You look at their shirts.

45:13.311 --> 45:16.884
On some you can see the little
nipples poking through the shirts.

45:16.981 --> 45:18.483
On others, nothing.

45:18.983 --> 45:21.327
Oh, I see. I got it.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.663
Buddy' you're in bad shape.

45:24.989 --> 45:27.731
You know what? I'm gonna
do you a favor. Come on.

45:28.993 --> 45:30.700
Let's go. You done here?

45:30.761 --> 45:31.831
Where are we going?

45:31.929 --> 45:34.239
Just come on. Let's go. If
my dad had been around,

45:34.332 --> 45:36.505
this is something I wish
he'd have done with me.

45:38.536 --> 45:40.345
I hope it's not a workout.

45:40.771 --> 45:42.114
I hope it's a sundae.

45:42.206 --> 45:43.241
Yeah. It's not.

45:43.341 --> 45:45.912
A dessert would follow that
chili dog really well.

45:46.010 --> 45:47.455
No ice cream, pal.

45:54.418 --> 45:55.863
Hey!

45:57.688 --> 46:01.226
Slumdog, I want you to meet Marzipan.
Marzipan, Slumdog.

46:01.292 --> 46:02.430
Hi.

46:02.526 --> 46:03.630
You said he was 16.

46:03.728 --> 46:06.800
Yeah, he is 16. He's got a
hydro-thyroid retentional problem.

46:06.931 --> 46:09.104
Remember Gary Coleman? Right?

46:09.200 --> 46:10.941
God rest his sweet, funny soul.

46:11.035 --> 46:15.313
Amen. Okay, let's do this. Chaiwalla,
all I can say is, "You're welcome."

46:15.406 --> 46:16.544
For what?

46:17.108 --> 46:18.781
Hit it.

46:23.948 --> 46:27.395
Three, four, five,

46:28.552 --> 46:32.159
six, seven, eight,

46:34.825 --> 46:36.498
nine... Can you bang it?

46:38.629 --> 46:39.937
Ten.

46:40.598 --> 46:42.100
Nice?

46:42.300 --> 46:43.301
Huh?

46:46.637 --> 46:47.775
Good, right?

46:49.307 --> 46:50.911
No tip? No tip.

46:51.309 --> 46:52.617
Asshole.

46:52.677 --> 46:55.988
Don't ask me for my last 10, Marzipan,
and then expect me to tip you.

46:56.080 --> 46:57.115
There's your tip.

46:57.181 --> 46:59.821
Bye, sweetie. Good luck
with your glands and shit.

46:59.917 --> 47:01.919
Thank you. Wasn't that good?

47:02.620 --> 47:03.655
I lied to her.

47:03.754 --> 47:05.700
I still have a couple bucks.
Want to get the ice cream now?

47:05.790 --> 47:08.600
Fuck the ice cream. How
much to touch 'em?

47:10.328 --> 47:11.432
I don't know.

47:12.763 --> 47:16.176
Which way did she go? She turn right'?
Let's go ask her.

47:16.267 --> 47:17.940
Marzipan!

47:20.037 --> 47:22.517
That might be true, but I
still think a person your age

47:22.606 --> 47:24.381
should be carrying at least
a dollar in his pocket,

47:24.475 --> 47:26.148
and if you had, that would
have been the difference.

47:26.210 --> 47:27.689
Would've gotten yourself
a little bit of skin.

47:27.778 --> 47:30.486
But it was still the
best time of my life.

47:30.548 --> 47:32.459
Are we friends now?

47:36.620 --> 47:38.224
Cool.

47:51.035 --> 47:52.412
I'd like it if you could
just block out a little

47:52.503 --> 47:55.313
private time for me
after today's round.

47:55.373 --> 47:56.408
If you don't mind.

47:59.977 --> 48:02.017
You saying you want to come
over and fuck off again?

48:03.981 --> 48:05.517
No, that's not what I'm...

48:05.583 --> 48:07.221
You want to look for
your underwear?

48:07.318 --> 48:08.319
Just give me 10 minutes.

48:08.486 --> 48:12.832
Guy, I wanted to give you something
before the round starts.

48:14.258 --> 48:17.000
A little Wite-Out and a Lego
piece, and you got your car back.

48:18.829 --> 48:19.864
Thanks, buddy.

48:20.398 --> 48:22.878
But I'm still gonna
totally bust your nut.

48:23.334 --> 48:26.178
I don't think you
mean to say that.

48:26.237 --> 48:27.341
I do.

48:27.505 --> 48:28.540
No, say you're
gonna kick my ass.

48:28.606 --> 48:30.347
Okay. That. All right.

48:30.408 --> 48:32.513
See you there. See you there.

48:34.779 --> 48:35.951
What was that about?

48:36.046 --> 48:37.719
I don't know. Kids are weird.

48:59.537 --> 49:03.576
Stand by in five,
four, three, two...

49:04.074 --> 49:06.213
Welcome, America,
to round two of

49:06.310 --> 49:08.381
the Golden Quill
National Spelling Bee.

49:08.446 --> 49:11.586
It is a point where, sadly,
many have already gone home.

49:11.715 --> 49:15.253
But the fighting spirit remains
for those who have survived.

49:15.319 --> 49:16.627
And that number is 30.

49:16.720 --> 49:20.167
Thirty brave, determined
competitors who are here...

49:20.458 --> 49:22.233
Here are this round's words.

49:22.293 --> 49:24.637
And let's remember, this
competition is in English,

49:24.728 --> 49:26.674
not "marble mouth."

49:32.403 --> 49:33.746
Rhapsodize.

49:35.406 --> 49:36.612
Rhapsodize.

49:38.576 --> 49:40.487
Rhapsodize.

49:43.447 --> 49:44.653
Rhapsodize.

49:47.918 --> 49:49.761
Rhapsodize.

49:51.655 --> 49:52.963
Joyce?

49:53.657 --> 49:57.764
Wondering if that's your hair
clip or somethin' over there?

49:57.928 --> 49:59.305
Where? Underneath that
seat right there.

49:59.363 --> 50:01.809
Can you see it? It's
certainly not mine.

50:01.866 --> 50:03.675
I just don't want you to lose
something that might cost...

50:03.767 --> 50:06.543
There you go. Give it a look.

50:06.637 --> 50:08.981
My behavior was
ridiculous, at best.

50:11.008 --> 50:12.453
I'm in credibly lucky that!
Wasn't

50:12.610 --> 50:14.021
beaten to death by the parents.

50:14.111 --> 50:16.614
There's nothing down there.
Not that I can see.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.284
Or their children.

50:18.349 --> 50:20.693
That's a big "never
mind" now, okay?

50:20.784 --> 50:24.027
I want you to get ready
to get super-happy.

50:24.121 --> 50:25.964
We've got a celebration
on our hands.

50:26.023 --> 50:27.559
What are you talking about?

50:28.559 --> 50:33.702
It seems that your friend
has finally come to town.

50:33.797 --> 50:35.140
My what? Yeah.

50:35.199 --> 50:37.076
Somebody's a woman today.

50:39.203 --> 50:40.978
I don't know what
you're saying to me.

50:43.641 --> 50:46.815
When you got up, I saw

50:47.811 --> 50:49.848
your adulthood.

50:50.548 --> 50:51.652
Adulthood?

51:01.559 --> 51:04.506
Congratulations. You
must be vibrating.

51:04.562 --> 51:07.042
That's so exciting. But
you can celebrate later.

51:07.097 --> 51:10.203
Right now you've got a tournament to win.
You've got words to spell.

51:10.267 --> 51:12.543
Even though your
situation might not be

51:12.670 --> 51:14.946
very camera-friendly,
screw them.

51:15.406 --> 51:16.908
You get up there and you
take this tournament.

51:17.007 --> 51:18.077
You take what's yours.

51:18.175 --> 51:20.382
You've got a long walk to
make up there to excellence.

51:20.511 --> 51:23.355
Unfortunately, it is
all the way up there.

51:23.547 --> 51:25.220
That is correct.

51:25.349 --> 51:27.260
Next up is Joyce Sacks.
She's from...

51:27.351 --> 51:28.421
Oh, man.

51:28.519 --> 51:31.227
I know. I know. God, so many people
watching, and you're up next.

51:31.288 --> 51:33.029
I wish I had a sweatshirt
to give you, but I don't.

51:33.090 --> 51:35.092
So instead I want you
to just keep thinking,

51:35.192 --> 51:38.264
"These are not light pants.
These are not light pants."

51:38.362 --> 51:39.568
You just keep saying
it to yourself.

51:39.697 --> 51:41.734
Competitor 1124?

51:41.799 --> 51:44.939
That's you. "These are not
light pants." You can do it.

51:45.035 --> 51:46.742
Competitor 1124?

51:48.906 --> 51:50.613
1124.

51:50.708 --> 51:53.746
Clearly we have a case of stage
fright brewing in the back row.

51:53.811 --> 51:55.085
Sweetheart?

51:56.547 --> 51:57.582
Sweetheart?

51:57.648 --> 51:58.718
Mama, I can't.

51:58.782 --> 52:00.056
No, baby girl.

52:00.884 --> 52:01.954
I can't do it.

52:02.052 --> 52:03.998
I don't blame you. Looks
like a super-heavy flow.

52:04.088 --> 52:08.434
Competitor 1124, you must make
your way to the microphone now

52:08.993 --> 52:10.768
or be disqualified.

52:10.828 --> 52:12.637
Why don't you try to do a
hop-scoot with your chair?

52:12.730 --> 52:14.403
Just grab both sides of it
and you just kind of...

52:14.465 --> 52:15.910
I can't do this!

52:15.966 --> 52:19.641
She's gone. There she goes.
She made it this far, though.

52:19.737 --> 52:22.616
Clearly the pressure was
just too much for her.

52:22.673 --> 52:23.651
I hope she'll be all right.

52:23.741 --> 52:25.846
Yes, the tournament does create

52:25.976 --> 52:28.115
a natural selection,
does it not?

52:28.612 --> 52:29.613
Pruning of the weak.

52:29.680 --> 52:30.720
Lend her your jacket!

52:30.748 --> 52:31.954
Allowing the strong
to blossom...

52:32.016 --> 52:33.757
It's so tough. It's tough.

52:33.817 --> 52:34.921
Reach for the sky.

52:35.653 --> 52:37.132
They'll be good.

52:38.589 --> 52:39.829
Oh, dear.

52:43.193 --> 52:45.332
Is that my word'?
That's two words.

52:46.130 --> 52:47.131
Um...

52:48.666 --> 52:51.340
Is "Um" the word? I'd be
guessing at the "M's."

52:51.435 --> 52:52.436
What's going on?

52:58.542 --> 53:02.684
Floccinaucinihilipilification.

53:05.616 --> 53:06.651
Good gracious.

53:06.717 --> 53:08.822
That word is longer
than most sentences.

53:09.720 --> 53:12.030
Can you repeat it one
more time, please?

53:12.122 --> 53:13.396
Floccinaucini...

53:13.490 --> 53:15.629
As a professor of linguistics,

53:15.693 --> 53:17.969
I can tell you with
the utmost confidence

53:18.028 --> 53:20.474
that a true
orthographic enthusiast

53:20.564 --> 53:23.010
wouldn't flinch at
such a challenge.

53:25.903 --> 53:29.316

54:05.342 --> 54:09.119
N-O-U-G-A-T. Nougat.

54:09.346 --> 54:10.381
Incriminate.

54:10.447 --> 54:11.847
The root origin, please?

54:12.549 --> 54:13.619
Hagridden.

54:13.717 --> 54:16.459
CONTESTANT; H-A-G-R-I-

54:17.020 --> 54:18.795

A-R-I-A-N-I-S-M.

54:35.539 --> 54:36.711
Correct.

54:37.207 --> 54:38.413
Asterisk.

54:40.377 --> 54:41.583
Meticulous.

54:41.645 --> 54:43.454
Conjecture.

54:43.547 --> 54:44.651
Pertinacious.

54:44.882 --> 54:50.298
P-E-R-T-I-N-A-C-I-O-U-S.

54:50.387 --> 54:51.422
Correct.

54:53.724 --> 54:55.465
Sauerkraut.

54:55.559 --> 54:58.130

P-H-O-R-E-S-I-S.

55:05.736 --> 55:07.147
That is correct.

55:09.673 --> 55:12.153
Obviously, I'm not
going to resign.

55:12.242 --> 55:13.983
That would leave the
bee rudderless.

55:14.077 --> 55:16.114
- Oh, bullshit!
- Everyone, please.

55:16.180 --> 55:20.128
I know what I said. I... There is...
If you will all...

55:20.184 --> 55:23.358
Yes, I am the most qualified
person for this position.

55:23.453 --> 55:25.330
Pardon me! Yes?

55:25.422 --> 55:28.665
We just completed the
standard competition review.

55:29.159 --> 55:31.435
Guy Trilby didn't get
those words by accident.

55:31.528 --> 55:34.099
It appears the
randomized word list

55:34.164 --> 55:36.667
was purposefully
manipulated by you.

55:40.971 --> 55:42.541
You tampered with this.

55:43.273 --> 55:44.877
And I, in good conscience,

55:44.975 --> 55:48.479
cannot allow such an abuse of
your position to go unnoticed.

55:51.815 --> 55:53.726
And it didn't even stop him.

55:53.817 --> 55:55.125
True,

55:55.185 --> 55:57.495
but that's not really
the point, now, is it?

55:57.554 --> 55:58.554
He may be unlikable,

55:58.622 --> 56:01.694
but he's a contestant,
all the same.

56:01.792 --> 56:06.298
And all contestants
deserve a fair chance.

56:09.633 --> 56:13.376
And it didn't even stop him.
God damn it!

56:14.638 --> 56:16.709
You're done.

56:16.807 --> 56:19.151
Did I enunciate that
clearly enough?

56:36.326 --> 56:39.273
Mr. Trilby, you have a message.

56:41.899 --> 56:43.674
Thank you.

56:51.775 --> 56:53.721
You got a duck pond, huh?

57:00.050 --> 57:02.360
Did you want to see me, Dr.
Bowman?

57:02.419 --> 57:04.126
Yes, I do, Mr. Trilby.

57:06.757 --> 57:08.065
Do you like ducks?

57:10.093 --> 57:12.095
They're okay on a plate.

57:13.563 --> 57:18.103
You know, I got after it quite
a bit when I was younger.

57:18.201 --> 57:22.616
I stirred life's cocktail
pretty vigorously, if you will.

57:23.206 --> 57:26.119
I'd venture to say
that more than once,

57:26.209 --> 57:29.088
I found myself on the precipice

57:29.212 --> 57:32.091
of making a
life-altering mistake.

57:34.785 --> 57:39.131
But each time, with no
parental guidance whatsoever,

57:39.222 --> 57:40.758
I was able to carefully

57:43.126 --> 57:45.663
back up, turn around, walk away.

57:47.764 --> 57:49.402
Here I am today.

57:51.068 --> 57:53.776
I have people's respect,
I have their admiration.

57:53.837 --> 57:55.407
I have control over
one of the most

57:55.572 --> 57:57.142
respected institutions
in the country.

57:57.741 --> 58:00.745
Had I not been able to
identify an approaching abyss,

58:01.111 --> 58:04.024
I'd be in a very different
position today.

58:05.415 --> 58:08.521
Mr. Trilby, I don't
know, I don't even care

58:08.618 --> 58:12.088
why you've chosen to place
yourself on this edge.

58:13.256 --> 58:15.099
But I can assure you,

58:16.793 --> 58:18.602
take one step further,

58:18.996 --> 58:21.476
and life will become
even more challenging

58:21.531 --> 58:23.875
than I'm sure it already is.

58:29.006 --> 58:31.486
A nice threat, is
that what that is?

58:33.176 --> 58:37.056
It's a safe prediction.
Losers lose, Mr. Trilby.

58:38.048 --> 58:39.994
And that's what I am, huh?

58:40.050 --> 58:41.529
Is that what I am, a loser?

58:42.853 --> 58:47.165
If you quack like them
and you walk like them,

58:48.158 --> 58:49.660
what would you be?

58:51.461 --> 58:53.134
That's cute.

58:59.002 --> 59:01.846
Just so you know, I didn't come
here to lose. And I'm not gonna.

59:04.474 --> 59:07.648
In the game I'm playing,
I'm way ahead right now.

59:09.079 --> 59:11.992
Okay. Whether you know it or not.
So...

59:19.423 --> 59:21.494
Thanks for the check-up.

59:30.734 --> 59:32.077
Good, Guy!

59:32.169 --> 59:34.581
Do you have a minute? Because
I have that thing...

59:34.671 --> 59:37.174
No. Sorry... that I need
to discuss with you.

59:38.542 --> 59:42.752
I'm kind of done with today. I'm just
gonna drop this gift off to the kid

59:42.846 --> 59:44.587
and then I'm gonna hit the sack.

59:44.681 --> 59:48.356
You bought him a present? Has the
Grinch found his Cindy Lou Who?

59:48.418 --> 59:50.193
That's from Dr. Seuss. I get it.

59:50.253 --> 59:54.565
No, this is just a little bit
of porn and some ice cream.

59:54.624 --> 59:56.465
Oh, Santa would be proud.
Can I get in, please?

59:56.526 --> 59:57.806
Come on. Get a drink with me.
No.

59:57.894 --> 59:59.737
This is important
I'll bet it's not.

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:03.438
You know, when somebody that
you've been sleeping with

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:04.773
says they'd like
to speak with you,

01:00:04.868 --> 01:00:06.711
the least you could
do is fake it.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.875
Well... Come on.

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:11.076
Did I just wake up 10 years later?
Are we married?

01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:13.120
Please?

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:21.787
Don't flatter yourself.

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:23.922
I had something important
to talk to you about.

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:26.294
Prick!

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:27.891
Sorry!

01:00:30.594 --> 01:00:31.629
Good night!

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:32.831
Little fuckin' prick!

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:46.645
Dad, he's nothing.

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:48.450
He took me around to see
the sights last night.

01:00:48.512 --> 01:00:50.355
Something that you've
never done, by the way.

01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:52.484
Chaitanya, stay focused.

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.421
This man is your enemy.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:59.991
Keep him close, but don't forget that.
Remember Donnie Brasco.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.535
Do you want to win?

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:03.966
Do you?

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:05.097
Yes.

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:09.201
Then keep him best friends so
that he can't bear to beat you.

01:01:09.966 --> 01:01:11.639
Dad, I know the plan.

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:15.139
Hey.

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:16.943
Hey.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.514
You're pretending to be my
friend just to try to win?

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:21.611
What? No, no!

01:01:21.778 --> 01:01:22.778
No, no?

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:25.122
I just heard you and
your dad talking,

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:26.627
just outside the door there.

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:28.360
Let's all relax.

01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:30.863
Eat shit, buddy. I'll hit
you in the face. Okay?

01:01:30.954 --> 01:01:32.900
You little fuck! I can't believe
I was your goddamn mark!

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:34.559
It was my dad's idea, okay?

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:36.331
No, it wasn't. You're
a little liar.

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:38.370
He felt you were the biggest threat.
Great.

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:39.804
And you were. Yup.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:43.636
Dad, I really like him.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.179
You make me sick.
You know that'?

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:47.846
I'm not doing the plan anymore.

01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:50.383
I'm just being friends.
Because we are now.

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:52.350
No, we're not. I didn't
know we would be!

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:53.979
Really? I thought winning
wasn't everything.

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:55.751
It isn't everything! Not now!

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:57.552
Sure sounds like it.
You're a liar!

01:01:57.647 --> 01:02:00.491
Guy, you showed me
my first boobs.

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:04.060
What did he say?

01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:07.226
Another lie. He's
a lying machine.

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:08.496
Guy, please!

01:02:08.825 --> 01:02:09.826
Please what?

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:11.930
My dad will be so
disappointed in me if I lose!

01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:13.939
I don't want that!

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.100
Well, tough shit.

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:18.239
I guess you're just gonna have
to try to beat me now, huh.

01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:19.871
And you can have this back.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:04.415
Hello?

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:06.722
Hi, Chaitanya. This is
Ingrid at the front desk.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.888
Your father just called
to say he's driving by,

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:10.556
and if you can be in the
lobby in one minute,

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:12.224
he'll take you out
for ice cream.

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:13.392
Really?

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:23.529
Todd!

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:29.367
Todd!

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:53.697
Los Angeles 911.

01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:55.430
Hello? Is it an emergency?

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:56.902
Yes, this is an emergency.

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:58.870
What is the nature and the
location of your emergency?

01:04:58.928 --> 01:05:01.499
Please send the police to the
Sportsman's Lodge Hotel right away.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:02.599
What's the problem?

01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:05.009
I just saw a man drag a
teenager into his room,

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:06.604
and she was screaming for help.

01:05:06.703 --> 01:05:08.080
But as soon as the door shut,

01:05:08.171 --> 01:05:09.673
the screaming suddenly stopped.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.946
LAPD. Open up.

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:25.834
What are you tryin' to do
to me, you little bitch?

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:28.433
He's still got her in there.
Open up, now!

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:34.470
Hold your tits. I'm coming.

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:36.952
Shit, get in there now.
Break the door.

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:45.416
Little bastard.

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:47.146
At least they didn't
press charges.

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:48.722
I'll be pressing the
fucking charges.

01:05:48.812 --> 01:05:50.257
It almost broke my goddamn face!

01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:51.758
Guy, I've gotta talk to
you about something.

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:53.158
I don't care how much of
an asshole you are to me,

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:54.956
I'm getting it said right now.

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:56.621
I've been doing some digging...

01:05:56.753 --> 01:05:58.391
Would you stop walking
for one second?

01:05:59.055 --> 01:06:00.932
Jesus Christ! I'm
kind of all you have.

01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:02.927
Can't walk and talk?

01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:06.165
What's wrong?

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:09.899
I found out who your father is.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:13.110
Oh, okay.

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:16.607
Good for you.

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:18.778
I guess you're not as bad a
reporter as I thought you were.

01:06:18.842 --> 01:06:21.322
It took you a while,
though, don't you think?

01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:23.413
It was right there.

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:31.125
So that's what you're up to?

01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:33.761
Yeah.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.634
Couple of months ago,
the day my mom died,

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:43.838
she finally told me who he
was and where he was, and...

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:45.276
And, um...

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:54.121
It pissed me off,
obviously, so here I am.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:02.292
He was just a traveling
encyclopedia salesman

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:05.731
and she was a
waitress at a diner.

01:07:07.624 --> 01:07:11.231
And she got pregnant and she
told him, and he took off.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.672
That's it? He never returned?

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:15.999
No.

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:17.637
He never called?

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.479
Nothin'.

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:23.381
So he has no idea who you are?

01:07:23.473 --> 01:07:26.545
He has no clue. But he will.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.357
As soon as I'm done
embarrassing him

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:31.613
and his precious spelling bee,

01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:35.561
Bill Bowman will never
forget who I am.

01:07:35.652 --> 01:07:38.098
And I think that that is
just the bare minimum

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:41.430
that a son can expect from
his father, don't you?

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:53.245
Good digging. Did
you park up here?

01:07:53.336 --> 01:07:54.337
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:00.419
Dr. Bowman, I know that
Director Deagan's resignation

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:02.956
was as difficult for you as it was for her.
Your thoughts?

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.784
She has served this tournament
well for many years.

01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:10.057
It's a tragedy that the frayed
integrity of this year's tournament

01:08:10.119 --> 01:08:12.360
has touched her post as well.

01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:15.699
I hope we can finish up now
without any more casualties.

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:18.133
Profoundly stated.

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:21.401
Now let's begin this,
the final round.

01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:23.410
Ten competitors remain.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.979
First up, Eric Tai from
Shorewood, Wisconsin.

01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:29.812
I'm gonna bust your nut.

01:08:30.872 --> 01:08:32.944
I'm gonna fuckin' end you.

01:08:38.548 --> 01:08:39.582
Inchoate.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:41.652
Inchoate.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:44.560
Can I have the
definition, please?

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:47.957
"Not yet completed or fully
developed, rudimentary."

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:52.062
<i>The closer I got to the end, the
more I thought about the goal.</i>

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:54.267
<i>And the more I thought
about the win.</i>

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:58.836
C-H-O-A-T-E. Inchoate.

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:00.778
That is correct.

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:06.852
<i>And once again, Chaitanya Chopra
approaches the microphone.</i>

01:09:06.943 --> 01:09:08.819
<i>He was here last year,
and he hopes to</i>

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:10.904
<i>bring it all the way to the
finish line this year.</i>

01:09:10.912 --> 01:09:13.359
Well, he has company
on that hope.

01:09:13.448 --> 01:09:14.587
Tmesis.

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:15.854
Tmesis.

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.020
Definition?

01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:19.327
"In grammar and rhetoric,"

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:22.335
"the separation of the
parts of a compound word"

01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:24.837
"now generally done
for humorous effect."

01:09:24.926 --> 01:09:27.805
"For example,
'abso-bloody-lutely.“."

01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:32.307
Is the origin from the
Greek "a cutting"?

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:33.703
Yes.

01:09:34.037 --> 01:09:37.450
Tmesis. T-

01:09:40.143 --> 01:09:42.817
M-E-S-I-S.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.952
- Tmesis.
- That is correct.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.698
Quiet in the audience, please.

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:54.962
Mr. Trilby has
certainly received

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.903
his fair share of booing
at this year's tournament.

01:09:57.994 --> 01:09:59.200
Yes, another of
this year's firsts.

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:00.898
Thank you.

01:10:00.997 --> 01:10:02.499
Continuing.

01:10:06.803 --> 01:10:07.975
Slubberdegullion.

01:10:09.072 --> 01:10:10.210
Slubberdegullion?

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:11.649
Slubberdegullion.

01:10:12.642 --> 01:10:13.985
Perfect. S...

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.712
I know the definition of that.

01:10:15.812 --> 01:10:17.553
"A dirty, wretched slob."

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:19.886
Just like you, sir.

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:21.704
Was I supposed to hear that?

01:10:21.818 --> 01:10:23.593
Yes, you were. Because
that's what you are.

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:26.860
Madam, please. Or I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:28.999
You're gonna have
to ask me to leave?

01:10:29.092 --> 01:10:31.504
I think you should ask
him to leave, huh!

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.598
- Take it easy.
- Gentlemen' please.

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:35.039
You're telling me
to take it easy?

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:36.438
We're trying to have
a spelling bee!

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:37.772
You're bringing the cops.
Ma'am, please...

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:42.077
No! No, no! He called my
baby boy a cocksucker,

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:45.209
and I will not repeat what he
said to me about my vagina.

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:46.674
Okay, ma'am, that's
it, we're going.

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:48.883
Nope. I'm not going. You
have to carry me out.

01:10:49.045 --> 01:10:51.184
No, I'm gonna sit here,
I'm gonna stay here,

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:54.285
and you're gonna have to work
for it, you cocksuckers!

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:58.422
Because I have a beautiful,
young, fully-elasticized vagina.

01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:03.064
Don't take me out! Take him out!

01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:04.764
Well, here's hoping that
the guys in the truck

01:11:04.894 --> 01:11:06.532
found the seven-second button...

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:08.371
Take him out! Take him out!

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:10.934
Before you were all exposed
to a category of words

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:12.603
we're not accustomed to dealing
with here at the Quill.

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:14.874
That's enough! That is enough!

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.580
This is the Golden
Quill Spelling Bee.

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:25.982
We're on television
in millions of homes.

01:11:28.084 --> 01:11:30.826
Show some respect
for the tournament.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.404
And for me.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.620
I believe the word was
slubberdegullion.

01:11:53.576 --> 01:11:55.351
That's correct.
Slubberdegullion.

01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:01.089
S-L-U-B-B-E-R-

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:04.920
D-E-G-U-L-L-I-O-N.

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:06.964
That is correct.

01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:18.543
<i>With the humiliation
part taken care of</i>

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:21.046
<i>and the favored child
all but killed,</i>

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:24.542
<i>maybe I already had my win.</i>

01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:26.211
Eric Tai.

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:33.859
Kopophobia.

01:12:34.217 --> 01:12:35.696
Kopophobia.

01:12:36.052 --> 01:12:37.827
Can I have the
definition, please?

01:12:38.154 --> 01:12:39.724
"Fear of exhaustion."

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:42.530
"Otherwise known as
'Lexicographer's Curse!"

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:47.164
Is it derived from the Greek
kopos meaning "fatigue"?

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:48.300
Yes.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:54.542
K-O-P-O-P-O-B-I-A.

01:12:54.971 --> 01:12:56.041
No!

01:12:57.807 --> 01:13:00.651
Oh, my. Eric knew
that he left out the

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:03.919
it's been a long, long day, and
it's clearly taken its toll on him.

01:13:05.348 --> 01:13:07.919
Well, well. I think
you're gonna like this.

01:13:08.985 --> 01:13:10.896
We're on the verge
of history here,

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:13.866
with 40-year-old Guy
Trilby in the final two.

01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:17.327
Parisology.

01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:19.601
Parisology.

01:13:27.203 --> 01:13:31.345
P-A-R-I-S-O-

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:36.015
L-O-G-

01:13:41.384 --> 01:13:42.692
I-E.

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:49.596
Goodness me, what a dramatic
turn of events here.

01:13:49.692 --> 01:13:51.933
Yes. Yes, indeed.

01:13:54.063 --> 01:13:55.872
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you, quiet.

01:13:56.365 --> 01:14:00.108
The rules dictate... Thank you.
Quiet, please.

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:03.240
The rules dictate that because
he's one of the final two,

01:14:03.306 --> 01:14:05.718
he remains onstage
until his opponent

01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:08.219
correctly spells the next word.

01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:12.986
I'm finished here. You take it.
It's all yours.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.058
Contestant 157.

01:14:26.095 --> 01:14:29.076
Mr. Chopra, you
are one word away

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:32.144
from being the new
Golden Quill champion.

01:14:35.338 --> 01:14:37.011
Infinitesimally.

01:14:38.074 --> 01:14:39.747
Infinitesimally.

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:42.480
Can I have the definition?

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:45.917
Yes. "Exceedingly small."

01:14:47.016 --> 01:14:49.963
infinitesimally.

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:56.265
I-N-F-l-N-l-T-E-S-l-M-A-L-

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:06.475
Y-

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:09.681
No, no. Hey.

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:12.281
Oh, my. I can't believe it.

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:14.883
Not again.

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:16.513
What happened?

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:19.822
What are you doing?

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:21.483
If you think everything
I said was a lie,

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:22.996
then I'll prove that it wasn't.

01:15:23.052 --> 01:15:24.497
Ifs not about winning
to me anymore.

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.497
It's about my friend. Buddy, I
don't give a shit about that.

01:15:26.555 --> 01:15:28.535
And I don't care about that
either, with all due respect.

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:30.365
Very nice of you, very sweet.
But I'm not here for that.

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:32.666
I'm not here for a fuckin' trophy
or a check, or these idiots.

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:35.174
I hurt your feelings. And I
wasn't a good friend. I'm sorry.

01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:36.676
We're good.

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:40.209
Okay, next?

01:15:41.637 --> 01:15:42.638
Rugose.

01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:46.044
R-U-G-O-S. Ding it.

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:47.849
I'm finished! Let's go!

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.821
You're wasting my fucking time.
Come on.

01:15:52.248 --> 01:15:53.488
Pejorative.

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:58.355
P-E-J-O-R-A-T-E-V-E.

01:15:58.421 --> 01:15:59.729
Pejorative.

01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:02.689
It seems as though they're
misspelling the words on purpose.

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:04.263
Will you just spell
the fucking words?

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.998
That's all you've gotta do and
you've got the tournament.

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:07.166
Same with you.

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.732
Chai-latte, get your shit
together, you dumb dick!

01:16:10.166 --> 01:16:11.509
Fuck you, Guy!

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:15.212
Nice. Great.

01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:18.512
Dad, you've got a
real prince here.

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:20.417
Yeah, he's a liar and
he's swearing now.

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:22.216
It's a good combo. It's sweet.

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:24.016
One more word, please?

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:27.889
I did not lie! Got it?

01:16:28.184 --> 01:16:30.562
I say that you did!

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:31.620
Got it?

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:39.862
Okay. This has turned ugly.

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:44.371
You can add violent to the list.

01:16:44.467 --> 01:16:46.140
Your boy Gandhi would
be real proud.

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:50.374
And by the way, I was born

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:54.546
in Cleveland, Ohio!

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:09.231
Share your voice.
We share your mind.

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:12.795
We show you extraordinary
programs with extraordinary...

01:17:15.064 --> 01:17:16.441
For 200 million...

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:18.567
I really don't know
what to say, America.

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:20.447
Dr. Bowman is conferring
with the judges...

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:23.181
addressing the audience.

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:25.513
Okay. I'll figure it out.

01:17:26.242 --> 01:17:27.778
Watch your step.

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:29.980
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:32.751
boys and girls,

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:35.827
those of you at home
and in attendance,

01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:39.024
I would like to extend
my deepest apologies

01:17:39.121 --> 01:17:43.263
for what has devolved
into an embarrassment,

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:45.703
this year's competition.

01:17:45.794 --> 01:17:48.172
The Golden Quill
has always enjoyed

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:49.937
an immaculate reputation

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:54.539
of respectful, challenging
and dignified behavior.

01:17:55.271 --> 01:17:56.545
Until now.

01:17:56.972 --> 01:17:58.974
Well, hopefully the end is near.

01:17:59.108 --> 01:18:00.109
Gentlemen!

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:03.019
It has been decided
that neither of you

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:05.489
is going to be
disqualified because...

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:08.353
It appears that both of you

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:10.519
have conducted
yourselves equally

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:12.292
in a shameful manner.

01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:15.564
So let's get on with this
contest and finish it.

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:18.699
I'm gonna ask the audience
to please remain silent.

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:20.231
Thank you.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:24.371
And continuing...

01:18:24.466 --> 01:18:26.139
Yeah. My turn.

01:18:27.736 --> 01:18:28.736
Unguent.

01:18:28.804 --> 01:18:31.978
Unguent? A-N-G-U-E-N-T. Ding it.

01:18:33.909 --> 01:18:35.183
I can do this all night.

01:18:36.145 --> 01:18:37.146
Go ahead.

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:45.721
Please, very carefully
consider the word.

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:47.893
Callithump.

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:52.338
C-A-L...

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:53.839
Chaitan!

01:18:55.764 --> 01:18:57.437
Please don't do this to us.

01:19:10.346 --> 01:19:12.519
C-A-L...

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:14.853
Ifs the easiest
word of the night.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:18.364
C-A-L-l-T-H-U-M-P.
It's simple, idiot.

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:21.364
No, you're the idiot.
You forgot an L.

01:19:21.557 --> 01:19:23.559
All right! That's all That's all!

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:26.362
You tried to help a
fellow competitor cheat.

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:27.805
That is against the rules.

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:30.141
Sir, you are disqualified.

01:19:30.866 --> 01:19:34.211
Doesn't matter. I misspelled it.

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:36.880
He corrected me.

01:19:39.475 --> 01:19:43.753
Which means even though you
tried to help him cheat,

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:47.259
he wasn't cheating, and ended up

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:50.430
technically spelling the
word correctly on his own.

01:19:51.654 --> 01:19:54.658
So he is the new champion!

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:01.307
No! Guy! Guy, you tricked me!

01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:02.637
No, Guy!

01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:04.404
Chaiwalla, go hug
your chai-papa.

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:06.070
Guy, that's not fair!

01:20:07.836 --> 01:20:10.680
Here's your trophy, Chaitanya.
Congratulations.

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:13.950
And here's your
check for $50,000!

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:16.982
And here's your lifetime
supply of encyclopedias.

01:20:21.784 --> 01:20:23.024
Guess that worked, huh'?

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:24.654
You're the new champion.
How does it feel?

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:26.755
I don't consider
myself the champion.

01:20:26.855 --> 01:20:28.835
I consider myself the
co-champion with Guy.

01:20:29.258 --> 01:20:30.464
Guy!

01:20:33.262 --> 01:20:35.333
It was totally unfair
to disqualify you.

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.778
This is yours, too.
You let me win.

01:20:42.471 --> 01:20:44.280
And I want to give you half.

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:47.985
Plus, friends split things.

01:20:51.213 --> 01:20:52.453
Right?

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:29.553
<i>I don't know if! Should have
done things differently.</i>

01:21:30.018 --> 01:21:33.261
<i>Like I said, I'm not
good at a lot of things.</i>

01:21:36.425 --> 01:21:38.666
<i>Maybe there should have
been a screaming match.</i>

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:42.508
<i>A fight.</i>

01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:45.076
<i>Maybe some tears.</i>

01:21:52.174 --> 01:21:54.848
<i>But I guess I just
want to move on</i>

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:58.858
<i>and let you do the same.</i>

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:09.133
<i>What's done is done.</i>

01:22:10.192 --> 01:22:12.035
<i>I can't change what happened.</i>

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:16.474
<i>All I can do,</i>

01:22:18.567 --> 01:22:20.069
<i>all I want to do</i>

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:28.251
<i>is leave you with this apology.</i>

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.113
<i>This note,</i>

01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:35.894
<i>which started with me telling
you that my feelings were.</i>

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:43.168
What the hell could
you possibly write

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:45.738
that I would be
interested in reading?

01:22:49.398 --> 01:22:51.605
There's a bit in there
about me being your son.

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.083
Son.

01:23:39.448 --> 01:23:42.861
<i>And as much as I'd like
to hurt your feelings</i>

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:44.624
<i>and call you names,</i>

01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:48.665
<i>they're just words, and it
wouldn't change a thing.</i>

01:23:50.659 --> 01:23:53.037
<i>That's not what
this note was for.</i>

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:01.010
<i>Hopefully it has explained
why I did what I did</i>

01:24:02.404 --> 01:24:04.577
<i>and maybe even have
you understand.</i>

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:08.314
<i>If not, that's fine.</i>

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:16.689
<i>Yours literally, Guy Trilby.</i>

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:32.712
Watch this.

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.676
Hey, spelling nerd. Yes?

01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:36.873
Can you spell "douchebag"?

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:38.279
Of course.

01:24:40.509 --> 01:24:42.216
How about you spell,
"Pick up your books"?

01:24:42.611 --> 01:24:43.954
That's a sentence!

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:54.197
Hey, Slumdog.

01:24:57.025 --> 01:24:58.299
Wow!

01:24:58.427 --> 01:24:59.701
Right? Get over here.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.736
Where did you get this?

01:25:06.802 --> 01:25:10.443
Got this old police car at an auction
with my half of your winnings.

01:25:10.572 --> 01:25:13.280
So thank you very much. You
got me two cars in one month.

01:25:13.375 --> 01:25:14.581
You're a nice guy.

01:25:14.643 --> 01:25:15.713
Now, to pay you back,

01:25:17.379 --> 01:25:18.949
how about we go chase
some bad guys?

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:20.219
I would love to.

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:26.896
Whoo! Hey!

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.400
Coming to get you!

01:25:32.561 --> 01:25:33.767
This is awesome!

01:25:35.564 --> 01:25:36.941
We're gonna so get them all!
