01:34.685 --> 01:36.254
Hello?

01:36.287 --> 01:37.621
Are you still in bed?

01:37.655 --> 01:40.091
No. I've been up for awhile.

01:51.701 --> 01:52.569
Hey, man.

02:07.384 --> 02:10.187
Hey. We brought
you some groceries.

02:10.219 --> 02:11.222
Thanks.

02:11.254 --> 02:12.090
Jesus.

02:13.991 --> 02:15.093
I know, it's not me.

02:23.467 --> 02:24.302
So, what's new?

02:26.903 --> 02:30.540
Your moms biopsy
came back benign.

02:30.574 --> 02:31.442
Really? Cool.

02:33.977 --> 02:37.414
You should go get your
moles checked out too.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.383
Yeah, definitely.

02:42.151 --> 02:43.753
How are your finances?

02:43.787 --> 02:44.889
They're okay.

02:44.921 --> 02:45.722
Credit card?

02:45.756 --> 02:46.956
Could be worse.

02:46.990 --> 02:49.659
You know we're not
bailing you out again?

02:49.693 --> 02:50.995
I had a big case last week.

02:51.027 --> 02:53.129
Really, what was it?

02:53.163 --> 02:55.199
You know I'm not supposed
to talk about that stuff.

02:59.635 --> 03:01.838
This gay guy wanted
to me to find out

03:01.872 --> 03:03.174
whether another guy was gay.

03:06.443 --> 03:07.278
Was he?

03:08.211 --> 03:09.546
Yeah. A little bit.

03:11.414 --> 03:13.817
Oh, that's nice.

03:23.794 --> 03:25.029
What's on your mind, Abe?

03:25.062 --> 03:27.465
Should I be worried if
my pee smells like fish?

03:28.498 --> 03:29.400
Yeah, maybe.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.403
You know Rory Beans
is in the back, right?

03:33.437 --> 03:34.237
So what?

03:36.539 --> 03:37.441
Just leave, man.

03:39.008 --> 03:40.310
We're not gonna judge you.

03:52.889 --> 03:54.324
<i>I used to be loved.</i>

03:56.092 --> 03:57.527
<i>I used to be a kid detective.</i>

04:00.330 --> 04:01.832
<i>When I was 13,</i>

04:01.865 --> 04:04.268
<i>I solved the case of the
missing fundraiser money.</i>

04:04.300 --> 04:07.504
<i>It was Rory Beans, the
neighborhood knucklehead.</i>

04:07.538 --> 04:09.374
Get him, Rory.

04:14.144 --> 04:15.346
<i>In the beginning</i>

04:15.378 --> 04:17.281
<i>I ran my trade out
of a tree house.</i>

04:17.314 --> 04:18.915
<i>Somebody stole
the basketball magazines</i>

04:18.949 --> 04:20.317
<i>from my desk.</i>

04:20.350 --> 04:22.386
Can you remember what
else was in the cubby?

04:22.418 --> 04:25.389
My pencils, erasers,
some peanut butter cups,

04:25.422 --> 04:26.490
a photo of my bird...

04:26.523 --> 04:28.326
But, nothing else was taken?

04:30.661 --> 04:31.728
It was Clive Cunningham.

04:31.762 --> 04:32.997
How do you know?

04:33.029 --> 04:34.197
He's the only one
allergic to peanuts.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.867
Wow, thanks Abe.

04:36.899 --> 04:39.370
<i>Whenever we
watched movies as a family</i>

04:39.403 --> 04:40.538
<i>I would always spot the bad guy.</i>

04:40.571 --> 04:41.672
It was the bald man.

04:47.110 --> 04:49.146
<i>And guess the ending
in the second act.</i>

04:49.178 --> 04:50.347
She poisoned his drink.

04:54.884 --> 04:57.721
Seth Barret used to be
nice, but now he's mean.

04:57.754 --> 05:00.090
I need you to find
out what happened.

05:00.122 --> 05:01.759
Somebody keeps
borrowing my bicycle

05:01.791 --> 05:03.259
without asking permission.

05:03.293 --> 05:05.028
I found this in the park.

05:05.062 --> 05:07.898
I need to know what it is.

05:07.930 --> 05:10.166
I noticed some
blood on my dad's car.

05:10.199 --> 05:12.735
I want you to find
out what happened.

05:12.769 --> 05:13.838
Are you sure?

05:23.312 --> 05:25.382
I saw that Constable
Cleary was in the yard again.

05:25.415 --> 05:27.918
He wanted to catch me
up on the latest cases.

05:27.951 --> 05:29.887
Oh, that's so cute.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.456
Son, we want you to
know how impressed we are.

05:33.490 --> 05:35.793
I've never seen a young
person take such initiative

05:35.826 --> 05:37.927
for the sake of their community.

05:39.596 --> 05:40.764
<i>I was 12 when</i>

05:40.797 --> 05:43.100
<i>someone finally chopped
down my tree house.</i>

05:45.968 --> 05:47.137
<i>The town raised enough money</i>

05:47.170 --> 05:49.507
<i>to set me up with a real office,</i>

05:49.540 --> 05:51.709
<i>in the middle of main street.</i>

05:51.742 --> 05:55.179
<i>The mayor's daughter,
Gracie, was my secretary.</i>

05:55.211 --> 05:56.713
<i>I used to pay her in soda pop.</i>

05:59.182 --> 06:00.751
Abe Applebaum's office.

06:00.783 --> 06:01.618
Oh, hi Daddy!

06:02.485 --> 06:03.954
He's in with Principal Erwin.

06:03.987 --> 06:05.489
Want me to take a message?

06:05.521 --> 06:08.858
Someone stole the cashbox
from the school fundraiser.

06:08.891 --> 06:10.159
What was it for?

06:10.192 --> 06:11.262
Animal rescue.

06:12.428 --> 06:14.331
Rory Beans was bit
by a dog last summer.

06:15.699 --> 06:16.934
Someone's been sneaking
up the clock tower,

06:16.966 --> 06:17.867
changing the time.

06:17.901 --> 06:19.203
Sounds like the Red Shoe Gang.

06:19.235 --> 06:20.870
Don't you have a
boy on the inside?

06:20.903 --> 06:22.906
Not anymore. He
kept getting grounded.

06:31.348 --> 06:33.182
<i>I was often in one
of those situations</i>

06:33.216 --> 06:35.352
<i>where you're looking
for evidence in a house,</i>

06:35.384 --> 06:36.620
<i>and then you hear</i>

06:36.653 --> 06:38.189
<i>the owner come home,
so you have to hide.</i>

06:39.822 --> 06:41.524
<i>And it keeps seeming like
they're going to open the closet,</i>

06:41.557 --> 06:42.392
<i>but they don't.</i>

06:43.492 --> 06:44.260
<i>And then you sneeze</i>

06:44.293 --> 06:45.395
<i>and give yourself away.</i>

06:48.098 --> 06:50.266
Oh my
God, that's adorable.

06:50.300 --> 06:51.802
Bill, come and look at this!

06:53.937 --> 06:55.472
<i>One day,
while taking a stroll,</i>

06:55.504 --> 06:56.673
<i>it suddenly occurred to me</i>

06:56.706 --> 06:59.043
<i>who had robbed Mr.
Hepburn's candy store.</i>

06:59.076 --> 07:00.811
<i>I was awarded free
ice cream for life.</i>

07:00.843 --> 07:02.012
Here ya go, Abe.

07:02.045 --> 07:02.913
Thanks, Mr. H..

07:05.514 --> 07:08.651
Good morning, Abe.

07:08.685 --> 07:10.254
Hi, Abe.

07:11.622 --> 07:13.257
<i>As a
reward for all my hard work,</i>

07:13.290 --> 07:15.693
I was invited to play
drums for Sharkwater

07:15.725 --> 07:17.194
<i>at the annual Fall Barbecue.</i>

07:19.795 --> 07:21.632
<i>Sometimes I would
lie awake all night</i>

07:23.132 --> 07:25.769
<i>and wonder if I was the
smartest person in the world.</i>

07:30.841 --> 07:32.843
Oh my god, I met
this super cute boy

07:32.875 --> 07:34.745
at the record
store last weekend.

07:34.778 --> 07:36.213
You're always
meeting cute boys.

07:36.245 --> 07:37.714
It's driving me up the wall.

07:42.218 --> 07:43.920
- See you later.
- See you later.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.996
<i>It's been nearly
two weeks since the abduction</i>

07:52.028 --> 07:54.497
<i>of 14-year-old Gracie Gulliver,</i>

07:54.531 --> 07:57.468
<i>and the local anxiety
continues to mount.</i>

07:57.500 --> 07:58.668
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

07:58.701 --> 08:00.071
<i>She comes in my
store all the time.</i>

08:01.271 --> 08:03.807
<i>Things like this aren't
supposed to happen here.</i>

08:03.839 --> 08:05.141
<i>The mayor
and his wife released</i>

08:05.175 --> 08:06.877
<i>this emotional
statement on Tuesday.</i>

08:09.846 --> 08:11.148
Hello?

08:11.180 --> 08:13.783
Hey Abe,
it's Mindy Martingrove.

08:13.817 --> 08:15.552
Oh, hi.

08:15.584 --> 08:17.520
I was just wondering
how much longer

08:17.553 --> 08:19.689
do you think it'll take
you to find Gracie?

08:20.624 --> 08:21.459
Um...

08:23.860 --> 08:25.062
I'm not sure.

08:26.228 --> 08:27.865
My mom told
me not to tell you this,

08:27.898 --> 08:29.734
but we're all really
counting on you.

08:31.334 --> 08:32.802
I know you can do it.

08:50.687 --> 08:54.625
Constable Cleary still
hasn't called me back.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.195
Try and get some
sleep sweetheart.

08:58.227 --> 09:00.296
You have to stop
torturing yourself.

09:01.431 --> 09:03.100
She knows you're
thinking about her.

09:36.767 --> 09:37.801
Hello?

09:37.833 --> 09:39.902
Where the hell are you?

09:39.936 --> 09:41.471
It's Sunday.

09:41.504 --> 09:42.605
No. It's not.

09:50.147 --> 09:50.980
Fuck!

10:07.429 --> 10:09.265
Morning, Mr. Ackerman.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.052
Hey, sorry I'm late.

10:31.354 --> 10:32.489
Who did that?

10:32.522 --> 10:34.992
Some idiot I got
suspended, 20 years ago.

10:35.024 --> 10:37.461
He stole the fundraiser money
from the principal's office.

10:37.494 --> 10:39.062
And he's still pissed?

10:39.095 --> 10:41.398
His parents were about
to buy him a hunting kit.

10:41.431 --> 10:44.600
The widow Gulliver was here,
but she got tired of waiting.

10:44.634 --> 10:45.735
Is she coming back?

11:05.054 --> 11:06.355
Didn't I just find him?

11:06.389 --> 11:07.625
That was a year ago.

11:10.759 --> 11:12.461
So you're worried he's been
hit by a car or something?

11:12.495 --> 11:13.964
If it was a simple accident,

11:13.996 --> 11:15.899
somebody would have
called, wouldn't they?

11:15.932 --> 11:17.401
He's wearing his tags.

11:17.433 --> 11:19.269
Well, we're coming
up on Halloween.

11:19.302 --> 11:22.272
It's possible he was used in
some kind of satanic ritual.

11:22.304 --> 11:23.206
What?

11:23.240 --> 11:24.441
This is Willow Brook,

11:24.474 --> 11:25.908
and you know what kids
are like these days.

11:25.942 --> 11:27.443
This guy in my homeroom,

11:27.476 --> 11:29.413
Henry Hooper, claims he was
in New York over the summer

11:29.446 --> 11:30.913
and practiced with the Mets.

11:30.947 --> 11:32.582
I need to find
out if he's lying.

11:34.017 --> 11:34.852
He's lying.

11:35.719 --> 11:37.555
I have a $50 bill...

11:38.989 --> 11:39.824
Let me see it.

11:50.966 --> 11:52.702
Butter pecan, please.

12:00.543 --> 12:01.345
Thank you.

12:24.967 --> 12:26.302
What's going on?

12:57.267 --> 12:59.069
Oh good, you got my text.

12:59.101 --> 13:01.871
Nothing worse than walking
home with just toilet paper.

13:01.904 --> 13:04.274
Everybody knows you
need to take a shit.

13:04.307 --> 13:05.274
I'll get it next time.

13:05.307 --> 13:06.342
Yeah, sure.

13:13.515 --> 13:14.817
Hi, is this Mrs. Hooper?

13:17.486 --> 13:18.921
This is gonna sound strange,

13:18.955 --> 13:21.191
but did your son play baseball
with The Mets last summer?

13:22.491 --> 13:25.027
He didn't? Okay,
thank you very much.

13:49.753 --> 13:52.022
There's a girl in your office.

13:52.054 --> 13:53.055
What? Who is she?

13:53.089 --> 13:53.991
I don't know.

13:59.095 --> 13:59.964
What's the matter?

14:01.865 --> 14:03.366
I forgot to brush
my teeth today.

14:19.048 --> 14:20.350
Sorry to keep you waiting.

14:21.551 --> 14:22.753
I was out on a case.

14:22.785 --> 14:25.154
It's okay. I stole a
magazine from reception.

14:27.023 --> 14:28.459
Some cool stories in there.

14:37.667 --> 14:39.536
Lucy forgot to get your name.

14:39.568 --> 14:40.403
Caroline.

14:42.739 --> 14:43.941
Can I fix you a drink?

14:45.475 --> 14:46.677
No, thank you.

14:48.577 --> 14:49.512
How about some water?

14:49.546 --> 14:51.048
It gets pretty hot in here.

14:51.081 --> 14:51.914
Sure.

14:53.716 --> 14:54.551
Yeah?

14:55.884 --> 14:57.754
Could you bring Caroline
a bottle of water?

14:59.522 --> 15:00.524
From where?

15:01.691 --> 15:02.493
The store.

15:05.327 --> 15:06.562
Are you serious?

15:07.831 --> 15:09.800
- Yeah.
- It's okay, really.

15:09.832 --> 15:11.067
It's no trouble at all.

15:21.677 --> 15:24.246
So when's the last
time you solved a case?

15:24.279 --> 15:25.781
I solve them all the time.

15:25.815 --> 15:29.019
They just stopped putting
my picture in the paper.

15:33.056 --> 15:34.257
Who's that?

15:34.289 --> 15:36.293
That's me
and Mayor Gulliver.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.128
Isn't he the one
who hung himself?

15:39.596 --> 15:41.498
He also founded
the Potato Festival.

15:46.936 --> 15:48.138
I've actually
been here before.

15:48.171 --> 15:48.972
Oh yeah?

15:49.004 --> 15:50.439
About five years ago.

15:50.472 --> 15:53.142
Someone stole a silver broach,
at my 11th birthday party.

15:54.309 --> 15:55.644
You solved it in
less than an hour.

15:55.677 --> 15:57.147
That's probably
why I don't remember.

15:57.179 --> 15:59.482
You asked which of my
friends had the most cake.

15:59.515 --> 16:00.716
It's an old trick.

16:00.750 --> 16:01.985
When you answer a
question like that,

16:02.018 --> 16:04.454
your memory becomes
extremely selective.

16:04.486 --> 16:06.389
You're really telling me
who you trust the least

16:06.422 --> 16:07.624
without even knowing it.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.059
Cool.

16:10.092 --> 16:11.828
It only fails if you
have a really fat friend.

16:16.166 --> 16:18.502
Jesus.

16:29.778 --> 16:32.182
So what can I help
you with today?

16:32.215 --> 16:34.951
I have another case I was
hoping you might consider.

16:34.984 --> 16:35.819
Of course.

16:40.190 --> 16:41.859
Somebody murdered
my boyfriend.

16:45.227 --> 16:46.028
Seriously?

16:46.062 --> 16:47.063
Pretty seriously.

16:48.464 --> 16:49.833
He was stabbed 17 times.

16:57.407 --> 16:58.242
Um...

17:05.480 --> 17:06.983
- That's him.
- Oh!

17:10.153 --> 17:11.654
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

17:11.688 --> 17:12.889
Oh, your face looks better.

17:12.922 --> 17:13.990
Why? What happened?

17:15.892 --> 17:17.193
He was in a bar fight.

17:17.227 --> 17:18.894
It wasn't like that.

17:18.928 --> 17:20.597
It's an occupational hazard.

17:22.765 --> 17:24.167
When he was in high school,

17:24.200 --> 17:26.135
kids used to throw beer
bottles at the house.

17:26.169 --> 17:27.237
Oh, that's awful.

17:29.271 --> 17:30.640
You reek of alcohol.

17:33.542 --> 17:34.644
How's the sleuthing?

17:36.078 --> 17:37.246
Not bad.

17:37.279 --> 17:38.480
You know, we
really admire that

17:38.513 --> 17:40.616
you're still doing
that, sticking it out.

17:40.650 --> 17:42.552
It takes a lot of courage.

17:42.585 --> 17:44.086
You always knew what
you wanted to do,

17:44.119 --> 17:45.888
and you're not giving up.

17:45.922 --> 17:47.423
You're living your truth.

17:48.490 --> 17:49.658
Thanks.

17:49.692 --> 17:50.926
What are you working on?

17:50.960 --> 17:53.329
He's not supposed to
talk about his cases.

17:55.131 --> 17:57.768
Actually, I got a
pretty big one today.

17:59.035 --> 18:00.336
Oh yeah? What was it?

18:00.369 --> 18:01.870
Did you hear about that kid?

18:01.903 --> 18:03.574
The one they found in the
river a couple weeks ago?

18:05.575 --> 18:07.143
We were telling them earlier.

18:07.175 --> 18:08.544
Seems like the police
are getting nowhere

18:08.577 --> 18:10.079
with the local youth,

18:10.113 --> 18:12.048
so his girlfriend hired me
to find out what happened.

18:13.348 --> 18:14.817
Seriously?

18:14.851 --> 18:17.053
Yeah. I did some work
for her a few years back.

18:17.086 --> 18:18.721
What'd you tell her?

18:18.755 --> 18:20.757
I told her I'd think about it.

18:20.789 --> 18:22.125
You can't take that case.

18:23.492 --> 18:24.994
- Why not?
- Well, it wouldn't be fair.

18:25.028 --> 18:26.296
You don't have the experience.

18:26.328 --> 18:27.797
I've solved over
200 mysteries.

18:27.829 --> 18:29.965
How many of them
have been murders?

18:29.999 --> 18:32.168
You're taking advantage
of a young girl's naivety.

18:32.201 --> 18:33.403
She's not even paying me.

18:33.435 --> 18:34.803
Then what are
you doing it for?

18:34.836 --> 18:35.971
Isn't this your job?

18:36.005 --> 18:37.841
Or are you still
working for quarters?

18:37.874 --> 18:39.909
It's like you've
forgotten who I am.

18:39.942 --> 18:41.111
Who are you?

18:41.144 --> 18:42.311
Abe! Applebaum!

18:42.345 --> 18:43.813
I solved the case of
the missing time capsule

18:43.846 --> 18:45.048
when I was 12 years old!

18:45.080 --> 18:47.283
The mayor gave me the
key to the fucking city!

18:56.992 --> 18:59.628
Finally, after all this time,

18:59.662 --> 19:02.365
somebody trusts me
with a real case,

19:03.799 --> 19:05.000
a chance to prove myself.

19:05.034 --> 19:06.603
You're telling me I
shouldn't take it?

19:12.075 --> 19:13.509
Good for you Abe.

19:13.542 --> 19:15.644
Stop, please. It is
inadvertently patronizing.

19:15.678 --> 19:17.781
I know you don't mean
it to be, but it is.

19:49.811 --> 19:51.246
Have you heard of
the Red Shoe gang?

19:51.279 --> 19:53.849
Of course. Everyone knows
not to go near the Boiler Room.

19:53.883 --> 19:55.050
What's the Boiler Room?

19:55.084 --> 19:57.287
The biker bar, where
they all hang out.

19:57.319 --> 19:59.321
Oh, right.

19:59.355 --> 20:00.589
It used to be
called The Steamer.

20:00.623 --> 20:03.026
What does this have
to do with Patrick?

20:03.058 --> 20:05.028
Well, he was stabbed
seventeen times.

20:06.028 --> 20:07.997
Usually when that happens,

20:08.029 --> 20:10.899
it's because you've pissed
off the wrong people.

20:10.932 --> 20:12.769
Is it possible he was involved
in something dangerous?

20:12.801 --> 20:14.036
Such as?

20:14.069 --> 20:15.804
- Drugs?
- No.

20:15.837 --> 20:17.072
He would never do drugs.

20:17.105 --> 20:18.708
- Gambling?
- No, he would never gamble.

20:18.740 --> 20:19.908
Demon worship?

20:19.942 --> 20:21.345
No, he would never
worship a demon.

20:24.579 --> 20:26.082
Tell me about his home life.

20:27.849 --> 20:29.452
His parents were super strict.

20:30.987 --> 20:32.756
He had the highest
grades in our year.

20:32.788 --> 20:36.425
Is it possible the pressure
was too much for him?

20:36.459 --> 20:39.663
He was a good person,
he wanted to do well.

20:41.463 --> 20:44.366
In this line of work you
learn one thing quickly,

20:44.400 --> 20:46.236
everybody has secrets.

20:46.269 --> 20:48.404
No matter how simple
a case may seem,

20:48.438 --> 20:50.140
it's always shocking
what you find.

20:51.339 --> 20:53.876
I just want you to be prepared.

21:08.723 --> 21:10.359
Where do you wanna start?

21:10.393 --> 21:13.363
Shouldn't
we talk to his parents?

21:13.395 --> 21:16.165
I don't know, that's
a bit heavy, isn't it?

21:16.199 --> 21:17.868
Why don't we get
warmed up first?

21:19.234 --> 21:21.837
His friend Billy
works a few blocks away.

21:26.741 --> 21:28.811
His family
runs the butcher shop?

21:28.845 --> 21:30.012
Yeah, why?

21:31.446 --> 21:33.148
I was working a
case here the other week.

21:33.182 --> 21:35.050
Really? What was it?

21:36.251 --> 21:37.153
Nothing that serious.

21:37.185 --> 21:39.054
His dad might be a homosexual.

21:39.087 --> 21:40.123
Holy smokes.

21:40.155 --> 21:41.357
Don't say anything.

21:49.097 --> 21:50.933
Hey, Billy.

21:50.967 --> 21:51.768
Hi, Caroline.

21:52.634 --> 21:54.237
Who's this guy?

21:54.269 --> 21:56.271
He's a really
awesome detective.

21:56.305 --> 21:58.641
He's gonna help me find
out who killed Patrick.

21:58.673 --> 22:01.009
How many murders
have you solved?

22:01.042 --> 22:02.411
I have to ask
you some questions.

22:02.444 --> 22:03.846
I need you to be
completely honest with me.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.448
Now, I know what it's
like at that school.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.416
Drugs are more
popular than milk.

22:07.450 --> 22:08.951
To the best of your knowledge,

22:08.984 --> 22:11.253
did Patrick have any contact
with the kids on the stoop,

22:11.287 --> 22:12.456
or the Wild Geese?

22:14.891 --> 22:16.960
This guy has no
idea what he's doing.

22:20.128 --> 22:21.630
Yeah? Well, your dad is gay.

22:33.174 --> 22:35.211
Who else
lives around here?

22:37.346 --> 22:39.749
Can I offer you
something to drink?

22:39.781 --> 22:41.183
Are those cupcakes I smell?

22:41.217 --> 22:43.720
Sorry, they're for
my sister's class.

22:43.752 --> 22:45.020
My mom counted them.

22:45.054 --> 22:46.256
Is it her birthday
or something?

22:46.288 --> 22:48.224
No. She's just
not very popular.

22:49.090 --> 22:50.225
Calvin?

22:50.259 --> 22:52.060
Come upstairs please!

22:52.094 --> 22:53.462
Sorry, be right back.

23:07.343 --> 23:09.012
What are you doing?

23:09.045 --> 23:10.046
It's an old trick.

23:11.547 --> 23:13.783
Always open a window,
wherever you're invited.

23:13.816 --> 23:15.050
Why?

23:15.084 --> 23:17.353
In case you need
to sneak back in.

23:25.260 --> 23:26.162
What's the matter?

23:30.066 --> 23:31.534
Would it be easier
if she left the room?

23:31.567 --> 23:32.868
No, it's okay.

23:34.336 --> 23:37.640
Caroline,
I know you think

23:37.673 --> 23:39.675
Patrick was this
perfect boyfriend,

23:39.709 --> 23:42.111
but he was a lot
more complicated

23:42.144 --> 23:43.479
than he allowed you to believe.

23:43.511 --> 23:44.846
What do you mean?

23:44.880 --> 23:46.249
Give us an example.

23:46.281 --> 23:49.351
He used to
collect bottle caps.

23:50.952 --> 23:52.154
So?

23:52.188 --> 23:54.457
He had thousands.
It was compulsive.

23:56.291 --> 23:57.126
Anything else?

23:58.693 --> 24:03.465
Yeah, he lied, about movies
he hadn't actually seen

24:03.499 --> 24:06.001
or books he hadn't
actually read.

24:07.903 --> 24:09.072
Everybody does that.

24:10.271 --> 24:12.808
He was very impatient
with handicapped people.

24:14.009 --> 24:15.845
Was he cheating
on her or something?

24:15.877 --> 24:17.279
Why?

24:17.313 --> 24:19.349
You seem pretty determined
to shit on his grave.

24:22.817 --> 24:24.519
I'm sorry Caroline.

24:24.553 --> 24:26.723
You shouldn't have
found out this way.

24:26.756 --> 24:28.191
What are you talking about?

24:30.226 --> 24:31.428
He had a concubine.

24:33.194 --> 24:34.396
What's that?

24:34.430 --> 24:36.199
Sort of like a
second girlfriend.

24:37.098 --> 24:38.467
- Who?
- I don't know.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.336
But she sounded kind of wild.

24:40.368 --> 24:41.536
What the hell does that mean?

24:41.569 --> 24:43.605
He would brag about
the stuff she did.

24:43.638 --> 24:44.440
Such as?

24:51.646 --> 24:53.682
Put her hand on his penis.

24:56.085 --> 24:57.621
That's not so bad. What else?

25:00.423 --> 25:02.659
Put his penis in her mouth.

25:05.161 --> 25:06.863
You know there are
euphemisms for these things.

25:06.895 --> 25:09.699
Yeah, but I
didn't want to sound vulgar.

25:09.731 --> 25:11.267
How do you know he
wasn't making it up?

25:11.299 --> 25:12.934
He had a picture
hidden in his locker.

25:12.968 --> 25:14.303
But you didn't recognize her?

25:14.336 --> 25:16.172
She was wearing a tiger mask.

25:17.038 --> 25:20.009
That's all she was wearing.

25:21.509 --> 25:22.845
I don't believe you.

25:22.877 --> 25:24.746
I'm sorry, Caroline.

25:24.779 --> 25:27.282
I wouldn't say it
if I wasn't sure.

25:40.429 --> 25:43.600
God, those cupcakes
were killing me.

25:54.743 --> 25:56.245
So how long were you together?

25:57.779 --> 25:58.615
Three months.

26:00.382 --> 26:01.785
But that's high school time.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.387
So like six?

26:06.622 --> 26:07.957
I don't know.

26:07.990 --> 26:11.227
I thought he was
different from the others.

26:11.259 --> 26:12.528
Because he was a geek?

26:14.262 --> 26:15.197
He was cultured.

26:17.500 --> 26:20.103
I kept finding these
origami roses in my locker,

26:21.470 --> 26:24.173
on days when I had
a test or something.

26:24.205 --> 26:26.009
How'd you know
they were from him?

26:27.242 --> 26:29.144
He was the only
Asian in our school.

26:35.116 --> 26:37.819
I remember when girls still
went for the star quarterback.

26:37.853 --> 26:39.389
Nobody cares about football.

26:40.756 --> 26:42.792
God, this town got cynical.

26:42.825 --> 26:43.660
Did it?

26:44.527 --> 26:45.562
Look at this place.

26:47.663 --> 26:50.432
On Saturday night, this was
the center of the universe.

26:51.599 --> 26:53.034
They used to serve
breakfast for dinner

26:53.067 --> 26:55.003
and dinner for breakfast.

26:55.037 --> 26:56.538
Why?

26:56.571 --> 26:58.039
To be funny.

27:04.814 --> 27:07.817
Are you sure you
want to continue?

27:07.849 --> 27:08.684
Yeah.

27:11.153 --> 27:13.189
It won't feel real
until I understand.

27:14.423 --> 27:16.526
Then we gotta break
into the school.

27:16.558 --> 27:18.161
Why?

27:18.193 --> 27:19.928
I want to look
for that photograph.

27:35.411 --> 27:37.313
- Shit!
- What?

27:39.147 --> 27:41.884
They replaced
the vent.

27:41.916 --> 27:44.986
I think there might be a
window open on the other side.

27:45.019 --> 27:46.221
Why is that?

27:46.255 --> 27:48.024
The art class has
been oil painting.

27:48.057 --> 27:49.959
- So?
- Mrs. August is pregnant.

27:49.991 --> 27:52.161
She might be more
sensitive to the fumes.

27:52.193 --> 27:53.762
Are you making fun
of me or something?

28:05.340 --> 28:07.042
What's that noise?

28:07.076 --> 28:09.144
Must be
the over-nighters.

28:09.178 --> 28:10.446
Who?

28:10.479 --> 28:12.381
You know, the
kids who hide out

28:12.413 --> 28:13.982
at the school over the weekend?

28:16.184 --> 28:17.419
Good fucking god.

28:23.025 --> 28:24.160
This was his locker.

28:25.661 --> 28:26.895
- Shit...
- What?

28:28.297 --> 28:30.633
The cops
already cleared it.

28:30.665 --> 28:34.503
Just a bunch of fucking
bottle caps.

28:41.076 --> 28:42.377
I still have his jacket.

29:31.660 --> 29:32.729
Ugh, gross.

29:36.131 --> 29:37.233
Oh, Jesus!

29:40.269 --> 29:41.104
Sorry.

29:50.846 --> 29:52.115
Oh, thank god.

29:57.987 --> 29:58.821
Huh...

30:00.422 --> 30:01.591
What the hell?

30:17.405 --> 30:18.573
Yeah?

30:18.606 --> 30:20.710
How did you know it was me?

30:20.742 --> 30:21.543
I didn't.

30:23.077 --> 30:24.814
I need you to put me in
touch with your drug dealer.

30:24.846 --> 30:26.182
What? No.

30:26.214 --> 30:27.249
I want to ask
him some questions

30:27.281 --> 30:28.483
about these pills I found.

30:28.517 --> 30:29.719
Why don't you ask
your drug dealer?

30:29.751 --> 30:31.553
Because, we have a
special relationship.

30:31.586 --> 30:32.788
I don't want to ruin that.

30:32.820 --> 30:34.289
So go talk to the
kids on the stoop.

30:35.156 --> 30:36.725
No.

30:36.759 --> 30:40.496
Why? Are you afraid of
they'll make fun of you?

30:40.528 --> 30:41.797
Yeah right.

31:02.951 --> 31:04.554
So
that's the stoop?

31:05.753 --> 31:07.389
Technically, it's
a concrete divider.

31:15.163 --> 31:16.199
Check it out.

31:17.932 --> 31:19.234
What's up Apple Bum?

31:22.203 --> 31:23.505
You know what these are?

31:30.179 --> 31:31.614
- Holy shit.
- Yeah?

31:32.815 --> 31:34.549
Answer my questions,
I'll give you some.

31:36.285 --> 31:38.254
They're called Ego Boosters.

31:38.287 --> 31:39.188
What do they do?

31:39.221 --> 31:41.190
Give you that extra nudge.

31:41.222 --> 31:44.960
You wanna ask out a girl,
or do some stand-up,

31:44.992 --> 31:46.261
they improve your self-esteem.

31:46.295 --> 31:48.031
Looks like you
guys could use some.

31:49.230 --> 31:51.200
They also get
you super jacked.

31:51.232 --> 31:52.801
Why don't I feel anything?

31:52.835 --> 31:54.937
They take awhile to kick in,

31:54.970 --> 31:57.139
depending on how insecure
you normally are.

31:59.807 --> 32:01.576
How much is this
bottle be worth?

32:01.609 --> 32:02.777
Like a grand.

32:02.810 --> 32:04.679
Great, now he's not
gonna give us any.

32:04.712 --> 32:05.647
Tell me who the supplier is,

32:05.681 --> 32:07.016
I'll give you the whole bottle.

32:08.717 --> 32:09.552
Candy store.

32:12.287 --> 32:13.489
Is that a code
name or something?

32:13.521 --> 32:15.758
No. It's a candy store.

32:15.790 --> 32:17.025
Hepburn's candy store?

32:17.058 --> 32:19.228
Yeah, he's been
selling for years.

32:20.128 --> 32:21.563
It's the truth.

32:21.596 --> 32:24.099
Just go in there and tell
him you have a headache.

32:24.133 --> 32:24.933
You'll see.

32:58.467 --> 32:59.435
What happened?

33:04.306 --> 33:07.076
Nothing. I told
him I had a headache.

33:07.108 --> 33:09.177
Okay, what happened next?

33:09.211 --> 33:10.445
I bought this ice cream.

33:10.479 --> 33:11.413
It was too awkward.

33:13.915 --> 33:15.550
Here, I got you this.

33:16.884 --> 33:17.720
Thanks.

33:22.790 --> 33:24.993
I think maybe those
kids lied to you.

33:30.731 --> 33:33.001
Here comes the kid detective!

33:38.807 --> 33:39.808
Let me go!

33:45.980 --> 33:47.516
Abe, stop!

33:47.548 --> 33:50.385
Who is the supplier?
Who is the supplier?

33:50.419 --> 33:51.620
The Red Shoe Gang!

33:51.653 --> 33:53.221
How long have you lived
in this fucking town?

33:53.255 --> 33:54.823
Does it make you feel like
a big man to beat up a kid?

33:54.855 --> 33:56.491
Yes! These pills are awesome.

33:56.525 --> 33:58.728
Yeah? Be careful,
they're super addictive.

34:07.836 --> 34:08.737
What now?

34:08.769 --> 34:10.672
Take me to The Steamer.

34:10.706 --> 34:12.742
It's time to talk
to some adults.

34:25.586 --> 34:28.324
I'm here to see
Clive Cunningham.

34:32.927 --> 34:34.462
No peanut products.

34:34.496 --> 34:36.298
Right, sorry.

34:36.331 --> 34:37.233
Go ahead.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.282
We need to talk
about Patrick Chang.

35:02.523 --> 35:05.060
No.

35:16.637 --> 35:17.539
He wasn't there.

35:18.706 --> 35:20.174
What does that mean?

35:20.208 --> 35:22.244
We'll just have to work
it from another angle.

35:23.744 --> 35:25.146
Have those drugs worn off?

35:28.849 --> 35:29.784
Yeah, I think so.

35:43.731 --> 35:46.302
I don't know, maybe we
should call it a day.

35:46.335 --> 35:47.168
What's the matter?

35:50.338 --> 35:51.507
You realize that
if I go in there,

35:51.539 --> 35:53.576
we're really gonna have
to solve this thing.

35:54.675 --> 35:55.509
Of course.

35:58.146 --> 36:00.716
It's just, I find
that kind of pressure

36:00.748 --> 36:02.050
can be counter-productive.

36:18.367 --> 36:20.702
I'm very sorry to
have disturbed you.

36:20.735 --> 36:25.740
I know how devastating
and how deeply confusing

36:27.007 --> 36:28.776
these past few weeks
must have been.

36:28.809 --> 36:31.614
It's, it's beyond awful.

36:33.514 --> 36:35.016
Do you have kids?

36:35.050 --> 36:35.918
What? No.

36:37.251 --> 36:41.824
So you don't really understand
what we're dealing with.

36:43.891 --> 36:45.193
You're right. I'm sorry.

36:48.463 --> 36:49.532
It's been two weeks

36:50.699 --> 36:52.802
and the police haven't
offered any clarity.

36:54.235 --> 36:56.471
They're so preoccupied
with the physical evidence

36:56.505 --> 36:58.006
that they sometimes can overlook

36:58.039 --> 37:01.110
the more complex,
psychological integers.

37:02.411 --> 37:03.479
What does that mean?

37:05.414 --> 37:08.050
Do you keep a lot of
fruit in your kitchen?

37:08.083 --> 37:08.983
We used to.

37:09.016 --> 37:10.518
What did Patrick favor?

37:11.920 --> 37:14.990
When he was a kid
he loved peaches.

37:15.023 --> 37:16.826
And in the weeks
before his death?

37:19.628 --> 37:21.530
He ate a lot of bananas.

37:24.432 --> 37:27.635
They're dry,
which means no mess,

37:27.668 --> 37:29.270
no plate, no paper towels.

37:29.304 --> 37:31.874
You don't have to cut them
up, or even wash them.

37:31.907 --> 37:33.376
You see where I'm going this?

37:34.543 --> 37:35.378
No.

37:37.211 --> 37:39.715
I think he
may have been depressed.

37:43.818 --> 37:45.487
Our son wasn't depressed.

37:50.925 --> 37:53.161
I found these, in his jacket.

37:53.195 --> 37:54.028
Open them up.

38:00.434 --> 38:02.137
They're called Ego Boosters,

38:02.170 --> 38:05.441
basically a mixture of
coke and who knows what.

38:05.474 --> 38:07.109
Someone must
have planted them.

38:09.277 --> 38:11.947
To make it look like a
drug killing, after the fact?

38:14.014 --> 38:15.317
It hadn't occurred to you?

38:16.751 --> 38:18.921
I'm open to all possibilities.

38:18.954 --> 38:20.889
I realize it's probably easier

38:20.922 --> 38:23.157
to solve the murder
of a drug dealer

38:23.190 --> 38:25.660
than a mild-mannered
honor student,

38:26.827 --> 38:28.630
but these do not
belong to our boy!

38:37.771 --> 38:41.175
Patrick was cheating
on his girlfriend.

38:41.208 --> 38:42.376
With who?

38:42.409 --> 38:43.644
I don't know. I
haven't found her yet.

38:43.677 --> 38:45.146
So how can you be sure?

38:45.179 --> 38:46.614
His friend told me.

38:46.648 --> 38:48.283
His friend told you,
and you treat it as fact?

38:48.315 --> 38:50.885
No, Patrick had a
picture in his locker.

38:50.918 --> 38:51.753
Which you saw?

38:52.920 --> 38:53.755
No.

38:55.155 --> 38:56.557
Are you a detective?

38:56.590 --> 38:59.027
Or just some idiot who
believes whatever he's told?

39:01.530 --> 39:03.265
I've closed over 200 cases.

39:05.400 --> 39:06.769
How many of them murders?

39:16.478 --> 39:17.313
Three.

39:26.755 --> 39:29.325
Then don't let
me discourage you.

40:03.925 --> 40:05.528
He was a very private boy.

40:07.896 --> 40:09.431
We didn't even
know about Caroline

40:09.463 --> 40:11.266
until she called
us after his death.

40:14.501 --> 40:19.440
It's difficult to accept, that
you didn't know everything

40:19.474 --> 40:21.477
when you've loved
someone so thoroughly.

40:24.244 --> 40:28.851
I promise you, I will not
rest until this case is solved,

40:30.518 --> 40:32.755
and your family finds
some source of peace.

40:34.155 --> 40:35.357
Don't promise that.

40:37.858 --> 40:38.661
It's silly.

40:44.398 --> 40:45.500
Can I hang onto this?

41:00.614 --> 41:01.549
What?

41:01.583 --> 41:03.117
I think I found that tiger.

41:04.119 --> 41:05.120
Really? How?

41:06.521 --> 41:08.990
Social media. I keep telling
you to get with the times.

41:11.893 --> 41:14.929
Oh. Nice work.

41:19.501 --> 41:21.803
Hi, I'm looking
for Melody Miller.

41:21.835 --> 41:23.137
A little old, aren't you?

41:26.206 --> 41:27.708
I'm a private detective.

41:27.742 --> 41:28.744
I need to ask her
some questions...

41:28.777 --> 41:29.911
Spare me the theatrics.

41:29.943 --> 41:32.413
She's in the basement
with her sister.

41:34.748 --> 41:35.850
Your mom seems nice.

41:37.518 --> 41:38.653
No, she's getting to that age

41:38.686 --> 41:40.255
where she thinks
she's too cool for me.

41:41.789 --> 41:43.257
Who's Paul?

41:43.291 --> 41:44.726
Just some guy.

41:44.759 --> 41:46.561
He paid me 50 bucks to
write his name on my face.

41:46.594 --> 41:47.394
Not bad.

41:48.563 --> 41:50.699
I can wash
it off in a week.

41:50.731 --> 41:52.400
How much was
Patrick paying you?

41:53.501 --> 41:55.403
It wasn't like that.

41:55.436 --> 41:57.905
Patrick and I had some
very deep conversations.

41:57.938 --> 42:00.474
Oh yeah? What
was perplexing him?

42:00.507 --> 42:02.376
He was very concerned
about the environment,

42:02.409 --> 42:03.811
and whether or not our
distinct identities

42:03.844 --> 42:04.913
are just an illusion.

42:06.748 --> 42:09.717
Impressive. Ever
have any arguments?

42:10.751 --> 42:12.153
No.

42:12.186 --> 42:15.322
So you weren't jealous
of his real girlfriend?

42:15.356 --> 42:16.491
She's just a kid,

42:16.523 --> 42:18.527
cute, but I'm complicated.

42:21.128 --> 42:23.197
Did Patrick know his
life was in danger?

42:23.231 --> 42:24.633
The Red Shoe Gang had
no reason to hurt him

42:24.666 --> 42:26.168
as long as he kept
his grades up.

42:26.201 --> 42:27.635
I'm not sure I follow.

42:27.668 --> 42:29.237
Everyone had to submit their
locker codes to the office

42:29.269 --> 42:31.139
as a result of all the
drugs in the school.

42:31.172 --> 42:33.541
The principal could
open them at any time.

42:33.574 --> 42:35.976
So, the suppliers
had to recruit kids

42:36.010 --> 42:37.246
who were above suspicion.

42:38.512 --> 42:40.481
So the nerds became
the new dealers?

42:40.514 --> 42:42.850
Whoever had the highest
marks in each grade.

42:42.884 --> 42:43.751
That's awesome.

42:44.918 --> 42:46.887
Everyone knows smart
kids have no spine.

42:46.920 --> 42:48.155
It doesn't take much
to intimidate them.

42:48.188 --> 42:50.424
Have the police found you yet?

42:50.458 --> 42:52.027
No.

42:52.059 --> 42:52.860
Figures.

42:56.331 --> 42:57.633
Thank you very much, ladies.

43:02.637 --> 43:04.206
Thanks for waiting.

43:04.239 --> 43:05.273
I know this is weird.

43:09.210 --> 43:10.412
What's the matter?

43:10.445 --> 43:13.382
That car, it was with
us at Patrick's house.

43:14.449 --> 43:15.916
No way.

43:15.949 --> 43:17.885
Do you think
they're following us?

43:17.918 --> 43:18.753
Let's find out.

43:30.898 --> 43:32.067
What the hell?

43:41.108 --> 43:42.610
Try going faster.

43:42.643 --> 43:43.478
Okay.

44:07.735 --> 44:08.604
This is stupid.

44:10.070 --> 44:11.206
Okay, pull over here.

44:23.585 --> 44:24.920
Are you gonna do something?

44:25.786 --> 44:26.621
What?

44:27.755 --> 44:30.525
I mean, someone's
obviously following us.

44:30.557 --> 44:31.927
Isn't it safer to know who?

44:35.396 --> 44:36.965
Yeah, I guess so.

45:07.628 --> 45:08.462
No way.

45:12.032 --> 45:13.701
What the hell are you doing?

45:13.735 --> 45:15.336
We were worried about you.

45:15.369 --> 45:16.270
Whose car is this?

45:16.304 --> 45:17.439
Your uncle's.

45:17.472 --> 45:18.707
You guys are unbelievable.

45:18.739 --> 45:19.907
Are you out of your mind?

45:19.940 --> 45:21.342
We saw you walk into
The Boiler Room.

45:21.376 --> 45:23.545
How long have you
been following me?

45:23.577 --> 45:24.713
Since this morning.

45:25.612 --> 45:28.215
Get the fuck out of here!

45:28.248 --> 45:29.116
I am working!

45:30.550 --> 45:32.386
Do you not you understand
how humiliating this is?

45:32.420 --> 45:35.289
We...

45:35.322 --> 45:36.991
I told you, you
should of backed up.

45:37.025 --> 45:38.327
Why would I back up?

45:44.164 --> 45:45.400
Well, who was it?

45:47.201 --> 45:50.137
Reporters, for
the local paper.

45:50.170 --> 45:51.972
- Really?
- Yeah.

45:52.005 --> 45:53.607
What'd they want?

45:53.641 --> 45:55.076
Just to follow our crumbs

45:55.108 --> 45:57.011
and break the case
before we can.

45:57.045 --> 45:58.880
It happens all the time.

45:58.913 --> 46:00.349
That's so cool.

46:03.451 --> 46:05.019
It's irresponsible journalism.

46:06.820 --> 46:08.155
Oh.

46:35.916 --> 46:38.353
I won't be able to
help much tomorrow.

46:38.385 --> 46:39.186
Why not?

46:39.219 --> 46:40.521
It's a school day.

46:40.554 --> 46:42.723
The Principal always
calls if I miss class.

46:45.592 --> 46:47.861
Your parents seem pretty cool,

46:47.894 --> 46:49.965
about letting you
drive the car at least.

46:50.965 --> 46:52.200
That's 'cause they're dead.

46:53.434 --> 46:54.836
I live with my grandparents.

46:56.804 --> 46:57.739
Sorry, I didn't realize.

46:57.771 --> 46:59.606
I was really young.

46:59.639 --> 47:01.076
How did they die?

47:01.108 --> 47:02.110
Downhill skiing.

47:05.346 --> 47:06.181
Oh.

47:07.949 --> 47:09.017
Both of them?

47:11.786 --> 47:14.722
Yeah. It was a
very blistery day.

47:17.824 --> 47:19.626
In some ways you're lucky.

47:19.659 --> 47:21.262
My parents are always on my ass.

47:23.331 --> 47:25.066
I'm sorry. That was
really insensitive.

47:25.099 --> 47:28.135
I love my grandparents,
it's just not the same.

47:29.971 --> 47:30.905
They're pretty old.

47:32.539 --> 47:33.407
Must be lonely.

47:35.409 --> 47:36.577
I don't know.

47:36.610 --> 47:38.145
I've always felt
like there was this

47:39.012 --> 47:40.715
other presence watching over me.

47:42.750 --> 47:44.318
Do you believe in
that sort of thing?

47:45.719 --> 47:46.620
Yeah, sure.

47:50.057 --> 47:50.891
Why not?

47:55.563 --> 47:56.765
Good luck tomorrow.

47:56.797 --> 47:57.765
Let me know what you find.

47:57.798 --> 47:58.632
Sure thing.

48:11.545 --> 48:12.913
What are you doing here, Abe?

48:12.947 --> 48:15.583
You know you're not
allowed on school property.

48:16.884 --> 48:18.820
A man just
walked into your office.

48:20.655 --> 48:21.490
I know.

48:22.456 --> 48:24.458
I have the same problem.

48:24.492 --> 48:25.460
What do you want?

48:27.494 --> 48:28.996
To talk about Patrick Chang.

48:30.030 --> 48:31.231
You can't be serious.

48:31.264 --> 48:32.567
His girlfriend hired me.

48:35.202 --> 48:36.038
Is she okay?

48:37.038 --> 48:38.240
All things considered.

48:39.574 --> 48:41.443
I don't really think
it's hit her yet.

48:45.012 --> 48:48.150
I'll help you with yours,
if you'll help me with mine.

48:50.717 --> 48:53.687
One of the custodians
found some broken beakers

48:53.721 --> 48:55.757
in the science lab this morning.

48:55.789 --> 48:59.159
And Mrs. Hersholt
noticed some footprints

48:59.193 --> 49:00.429
on the floor of the gym.

49:01.728 --> 49:02.763
What?

49:02.797 --> 49:04.365
Over-nighters.

49:04.398 --> 49:05.600
Excuse me?

49:05.632 --> 49:07.401
Kids who stay at the
school over the weekend.

49:11.204 --> 49:13.842
How long has
this been going on?

49:13.875 --> 49:17.478
I don't know, seems like a
pretty established sub-culture.

49:23.951 --> 49:27.121
So, what can you tell
me about Patrick?

49:28.755 --> 49:29.824
He was a quiet kid.

49:31.893 --> 49:34.262
He used to mouth
the national anthem,

49:35.695 --> 49:36.898
as if we couldn't tell.

49:38.766 --> 49:40.001
Is that it?

49:40.034 --> 49:40.869
No.

49:43.871 --> 49:46.907
I was warned that he might
be mixed up in something

49:48.208 --> 49:50.444
about a week before his death.

49:50.478 --> 49:51.313
By who?

49:52.980 --> 49:54.014
One of his friends.

49:55.983 --> 49:58.385
I'm too old to
keep the names straight.

49:58.418 --> 50:00.955
Was he tall and ugly,
or portly and pathetic?

50:02.856 --> 50:05.692
He was a bit heavy, yes.

50:05.726 --> 50:06.528
Calvin?

50:06.561 --> 50:07.394
Mm-hmm.

50:08.829 --> 50:13.435
I checked Patrick's locker,
I couldn't find anything.

50:15.503 --> 50:16.438
Another fight
in the girls' restroom.

50:17.605 --> 50:18.706
Who is it this time?

50:19.706 --> 50:21.009
Both Beckys.

50:22.809 --> 50:24.846
What am I
supposed to do, Abe?

50:26.313 --> 50:28.983
These kids have no
concept of authority.

50:29.951 --> 50:31.019
I don't know, dude.

50:32.753 --> 50:35.157
Maybe there's more
nobility in just giving up.

50:37.224 --> 50:38.058
Maybe.

51:29.976 --> 51:30.878
Oh, wicked.

51:40.487 --> 51:45.492
"I only get one life, one body,
and I'm trapped in a teapot.

51:46.693 --> 51:47.894
A harmless shell,
with no hard edges,

51:47.927 --> 51:49.563
no one can see how
much love and violence

51:49.597 --> 51:51.166
I have inside my soul."

51:52.666 --> 51:53.835
Jesus Christ.

51:55.068 --> 51:56.536
"How to make her understand

51:56.570 --> 51:59.941
I'm the one who really sees
her, who knows what she's worth,

51:59.974 --> 52:02.543
who would never
mock her innocence,

52:02.576 --> 52:04.112
or take advantage of her trust."

52:18.059 --> 52:20.028
That's motive, motherfucker.

53:17.050 --> 53:20.121
Hey, turn the
music down, please?

53:21.789 --> 53:22.790
What are you doing home already?

53:22.822 --> 53:23.891
Last period spare.

53:24.858 --> 53:26.193
Want me to fix you a snack?

53:26.226 --> 53:28.562
No thanks, I'm not hungry.

53:53.586 --> 53:55.056
Mom wants you
to set the table.

53:55.088 --> 53:55.889
I'm doing my homework.

53:55.922 --> 53:56.857
No you're not.

53:56.891 --> 53:57.925
I set it last night.

53:57.958 --> 53:58.793
Okay.

54:05.231 --> 54:06.567
Calvin, come
down here please!

54:06.599 --> 54:09.938
Little bitch.

54:56.817 --> 54:58.119
Where are you going?

54:58.152 --> 54:59.387
I need to pee.

55:40.126 --> 55:41.528
- Jackie?
- Yeah?

55:41.561 --> 55:43.197
You haven't
finished your potatoes!

55:43.230 --> 55:44.365
I'm full.

55:50.036 --> 55:51.071
What did she say?

55:52.706 --> 55:54.108
But I thought she liked Jake?

55:54.141 --> 55:55.576
Time for bed honey.

55:55.608 --> 55:57.010
Okay, five minutes.

55:58.211 --> 56:00.148
Benji's an idiot.

56:01.315 --> 56:03.918
He didn't even know what
a kayak was.

56:09.456 --> 56:10.291
Mom?

56:11.358 --> 56:12.927
I'm scared.

56:12.960 --> 56:14.195
Of what?

56:14.228 --> 56:16.697
I think I heard
something in the closet.

56:19.432 --> 56:21.302
Come on Jackie, I
thought we were past this.

56:21.335 --> 56:24.271
You're too old for any
more monster nonsense.

56:24.304 --> 56:25.605
Sorry.

56:25.639 --> 56:26.474
Go to sleep.

56:58.938 --> 57:00.607
That kid is traumatized.

57:02.141 --> 57:03.610
The family is furious.

57:05.211 --> 57:06.179
Did you explain?

57:07.347 --> 57:09.349
What the hell was
I supposed to say?

57:09.382 --> 57:11.318
That you're some
wandering mental patient?

57:11.351 --> 57:12.853
A private detective.

57:12.885 --> 57:15.121
She's nine years old.

57:15.155 --> 57:17.490
I was investigating
the older brother,

57:17.523 --> 57:19.659
but I got trapped in the house.

57:19.693 --> 57:20.895
In connection to what?

57:22.396 --> 57:23.731
The Patrick Chang murder.

57:26.699 --> 57:28.235
Who hired you for a homicide?

57:29.737 --> 57:30.605
His girlfriend.

57:31.771 --> 57:32.672
I hope you're
not charging her.

57:32.706 --> 57:34.108
What have you found so far?

57:35.309 --> 57:37.278
I can't talk about that.

57:37.311 --> 57:38.813
It's an active investigation.

57:46.954 --> 57:51.025
Why didn't you call me back,
after Gracie got kidnapped?

57:54.327 --> 57:56.063
Because you were 12.

57:56.096 --> 57:59.067
So. I'd helped you before.

58:00.099 --> 58:01.969
How would it have looked,

58:02.001 --> 58:04.005
the police chief
consulting with a child

58:04.038 --> 58:05.940
in the middle of our
town's greatest crisis?

58:05.972 --> 58:06.873
You weren't the
chief back then.

58:06.907 --> 58:08.910
Well, lucky for you, I am now.

58:13.480 --> 58:16.117
I'll see what I can work
out with the family,

58:16.150 --> 58:18.086
convince them to drop
criminal charges.

58:19.219 --> 58:20.054
Thank you.

58:21.320 --> 58:22.690
This has to stop, Abe.

58:25.092 --> 58:29.297
Gracie was not your responsibility,
and neither is this.

58:31.931 --> 58:33.567
You can't run around
calling yourself a detective

58:33.599 --> 58:35.536
and expect everyone
else to play along.

58:38.038 --> 58:39.606
You know I've always liked you.

58:42.376 --> 58:44.812
But at a certain point,
we've all got to grow up.

58:47.414 --> 58:50.018
Maybe this is that opportunity.

58:58.391 --> 59:00.127
Your parents posted your bail.

59:39.532 --> 59:40.768
Hello?

59:40.800 --> 59:42.536
You finally made
the paper again.

59:44.771 --> 59:46.206
What does it say?

59:46.239 --> 59:47.440
That you were
found masturbating

59:47.474 --> 59:48.976
in a little girl's bedroom.

59:52.780 --> 59:56.182
I wasn't masturbating.

1:00:00.653 --> 1:00:02.556
I believe you.

1:00:13.300 --> 1:00:14.902
I'm really sorry, man.

1:00:14.934 --> 1:00:17.438
But my friend really
needs to get in there.

1:00:26.579 --> 1:00:28.081
It was the maid.

1:00:51.103 --> 1:00:52.906
Thanks for coming, man.

1:00:52.940 --> 1:00:57.912
I've just been drinking
too much, you know?

1:01:29.742 --> 1:01:31.679
Hey. What are you doing here?

1:01:31.711 --> 1:01:34.081
I'm sorry, but you
weren't answering my calls.

1:01:35.849 --> 1:01:37.318
Yeah, I've been busy,

1:01:37.351 --> 1:01:39.954
and you're not and paying
me, so I had to prioritize.

1:01:39.987 --> 1:01:43.724
I found another paper
flower, in my locker.

1:01:43.757 --> 1:01:44.657
Okay.

1:01:44.690 --> 1:01:46.092
What do you think it means?

1:01:46.126 --> 1:01:48.262
That they were never
coming from Patrick.

1:01:49.228 --> 1:01:50.029
What?

1:01:50.063 --> 1:01:51.265
Origami is Japanese.

1:01:51.297 --> 1:01:52.498
He probably just
took credit for it,

1:01:52.532 --> 1:01:54.068
because you started
talking to him.

1:01:56.903 --> 1:01:57.871
Oh my God.

1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:01.309
I'm such a racist.

1:02:02.842 --> 1:02:05.111
Oh, relax, it's not that bad.

1:02:06.246 --> 1:02:07.514
Well, then who's making them?

1:02:07.547 --> 1:02:09.782
Probably Calvin.
He's in love with you.

1:02:09.815 --> 1:02:11.518
What? How do you know that?

1:02:23.496 --> 1:02:24.699
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1:02:37.110 --> 1:02:39.447
Are you ever
gonna get dressed?

1:02:41.681 --> 1:02:42.649
Why?

1:02:42.682 --> 1:02:44.351
I have people coming over.

1:02:44.384 --> 1:02:46.420
In the middle of the week?

1:02:46.452 --> 1:02:47.922
It's fucking Friday, man.

1:02:51.023 --> 1:02:52.326
For real?

1:04:02.429 --> 1:04:03.564
What the hell?

1:04:10.170 --> 1:04:11.005
What?

1:04:45.204 --> 1:04:46.105
Caroline?

1:04:46.139 --> 1:04:47.173
Where are you?

1:04:47.206 --> 1:04:48.674
I'm outside your place.

1:04:48.708 --> 1:04:50.177
You are?

1:04:50.210 --> 1:04:51.612
You called
me at midnight, remember?

1:04:51.644 --> 1:04:52.445
I did?

1:04:53.780 --> 1:04:56.115
You might have to
refresh my memory.

1:04:56.148 --> 1:04:57.083
You said
you wouldn't rest

1:04:57.117 --> 1:04:58.352
until this case was solved

1:04:58.385 --> 1:05:00.454
and my family found
some sort of peace.

1:05:01.554 --> 1:05:02.623
Remember?

1:05:21.407 --> 1:05:23.176
Are these your parents?

1:05:23.210 --> 1:05:24.045
Yeah.

1:05:26.213 --> 1:05:28.082
They're very photogenic.

1:05:28.114 --> 1:05:29.783
I know.

1:05:31.418 --> 1:05:33.019
And these are
your grandparents?

1:05:33.052 --> 1:05:33.953
Mm-hmm.

1:05:33.987 --> 1:05:35.088
Where are they right now?

1:05:36.422 --> 1:05:37.991
Probably out feeding pigeons.

1:05:43.096 --> 1:05:43.931
Thanks.

1:05:55.442 --> 1:05:57.376
I need to apologize
for the other day.

1:05:57.409 --> 1:05:58.744
It's okay.

1:05:58.777 --> 1:05:59.712
I'm sorry you had
to see me like that.

1:05:59.746 --> 1:06:01.148
I was in a pretty bad place.

1:06:04.083 --> 1:06:04.918
I got arrested.

1:06:08.021 --> 1:06:09.590
I know.

1:06:09.623 --> 1:06:10.891
You saw the paper?

1:06:10.923 --> 1:06:12.425
I went to your office.

1:06:12.458 --> 1:06:13.693
Your secretary showed me.

1:06:17.530 --> 1:06:18.364
What a cunt.

1:06:27.106 --> 1:06:29.309
The people in this town
used to look up to me,

1:06:31.344 --> 1:06:32.346
even the adults.

1:06:37.449 --> 1:06:38.851
I was so far ahead of the game,

1:06:38.885 --> 1:06:43.057
and then, one day I
just woke up behind.

1:06:45.257 --> 1:06:46.860
What do you mean?

1:06:49.461 --> 1:06:52.132
A few years ago, I heard
my roommate talking about me

1:06:52.164 --> 1:06:53.333
when he thought I wasn't home,

1:06:53.365 --> 1:06:57.938
and he called me a
detective, in quotes.

1:06:59.838 --> 1:07:02.208
I could hear him doing
this with his fingers.

1:07:04.878 --> 1:07:06.180
It's difficult to accept

1:07:07.347 --> 1:07:10.251
the difference between
who you are in your head

1:07:11.351 --> 1:07:12.786
and who you are in the world.

1:07:14.253 --> 1:07:15.422
I know what you mean.

1:07:17.489 --> 1:07:18.991
You do?

1:07:19.025 --> 1:07:21.628
People act like I've never
seen a restricted movie before,

1:07:21.661 --> 1:07:23.931
or stayed up past midnight.

1:07:25.931 --> 1:07:28.368
Even my own boyfriend saw
me as this little girl.

1:07:31.838 --> 1:07:34.208
Don't blame yourself for
what that kid did to you.

1:07:36.141 --> 1:07:37.710
Experience is overrated.

1:07:39.746 --> 1:07:41.315
The world has enough assholes.

1:07:44.117 --> 1:07:46.586
It's been awhile since
I've known anyone like you.

1:07:47.887 --> 1:07:49.789
Reminds me why I got
into this business.

1:07:58.597 --> 1:08:00.601
Your
clothes are ready.

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.470
What the hell happened?

1:08:36.502 --> 1:08:38.704
I had some friends over.

1:08:38.738 --> 1:08:41.208
The door's unlocked.
What if a client came in?

1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:42.975
I wouldn't worry about that

1:08:43.009 --> 1:08:44.845
now that you're
the town pedophile.

1:08:45.878 --> 1:08:47.680
The phone's off the hook.

1:08:47.713 --> 1:08:49.315
I wanted to make
sure you were okay.

1:08:50.483 --> 1:08:51.318
Wow.

1:09:16.676 --> 1:09:18.545
What is this thing?

1:09:20.246 --> 1:09:21.914
That girl left
it for you the other day.

1:09:21.948 --> 1:09:23.417
It's from her dead boyfriend.

1:09:28.154 --> 1:09:28.989
Poor Calvin.

1:10:03.122 --> 1:10:04.590
I need the key to the garage.

1:11:06.719 --> 1:11:07.554
Wow.

1:11:18.965 --> 1:11:20.167
Hello?

1:11:20.199 --> 1:11:21.902
I need you to
stay home tomorrow.

1:11:21.935 --> 1:11:23.804
What? Why?

1:11:24.770 --> 1:11:26.606
It isn't safe.

1:11:28.140 --> 1:11:29.509
They're not coming from Calvin.

1:11:53.765 --> 1:11:55.134
Have you found my cat yet?

1:11:56.469 --> 1:11:58.639
No, I actually completely
forgot about that.

1:12:01.140 --> 1:12:02.876
I'm here to talk
about your daughter.

1:12:17.657 --> 1:12:19.059
You preserved her bedroom.

1:12:20.260 --> 1:12:22.061
The house hasn't been
touched since Burt died.

1:12:22.095 --> 1:12:23.831
Yeah, my parents
just redid mine.

1:12:45.118 --> 1:12:47.855
Do you know where
this came from?

1:12:51.925 --> 1:12:54.828
She never said anything
about a secret admirer.

1:12:54.860 --> 1:12:55.962
Who could keep track?

1:13:00.766 --> 1:13:01.702
Is everything okay?

1:13:03.735 --> 1:13:04.570
Yeah.

1:13:06.773 --> 1:13:07.940
Nothing to worry about.

1:13:08.975 --> 1:13:12.246
Find my cat, Abe. I'm lonely.

1:13:21.354 --> 1:13:22.655
Everything alright, Abe?

1:13:25.158 --> 1:13:26.727
Yeah, why?

1:13:27.894 --> 1:13:29.997
Nobody real comes
in before five.

1:13:33.432 --> 1:13:34.734
My mind's running races.

1:13:36.402 --> 1:13:37.237
I need to relax.

1:13:38.637 --> 1:13:40.707
What happened the other
week with Rory Beans?

1:13:42.609 --> 1:13:44.044
He beat the shit out of me.

1:13:45.845 --> 1:13:47.547
Why don't you just apologize?

1:13:47.579 --> 1:13:49.015
For what?

1:13:49.047 --> 1:13:51.251
No one forced him to steal
the fundraiser money.

1:13:52.351 --> 1:13:53.554
He didn't do it, man.

1:13:55.988 --> 1:13:57.456
What?

1:13:57.489 --> 1:13:59.393
Why do you think
he hates you so much?

1:14:18.578 --> 1:14:19.613
He
stole the fundraiser money

1:14:19.645 --> 1:14:20.846
from the principal's office.

1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:22.382
- What was it for?
- Animal rescue.

1:14:22.414 --> 1:14:24.216
Rory beans was bit
by a dog last summer.

1:14:24.250 --> 1:14:25.385
Who did that?

1:14:25.417 --> 1:14:27.353
Some idiot I got
suspended 20 years ago.

1:14:27.386 --> 1:14:28.387
He's still pissed?

1:14:40.365 --> 1:14:42.435
Everyone had to submit their
locker codes to the office.

1:14:42.467 --> 1:14:44.570
I found another paper
flower in my locker.

1:14:44.604 --> 1:14:46.606
Has she ever said
anything about a secret admirer?

1:14:46.639 --> 1:14:47.841
I've always felt
like there was

1:14:47.873 --> 1:14:50.542
this other presence
watching over me.

1:14:52.944 --> 1:14:54.146
Yeah?

1:14:54.180 --> 1:14:55.315
Hey, I need
you to check the date

1:14:55.347 --> 1:14:56.917
on the first Rory Beans case.

1:14:57.884 --> 1:14:59.284
Are you serious?

1:14:59.318 --> 1:15:01.087
There was a chance
he was set up.

1:15:01.119 --> 1:15:03.256
I might know who's really
making those flowers.

1:16:30.943 --> 1:16:32.112
What the fuck?

1:17:42.414 --> 1:17:43.250
Abe,

1:17:46.519 --> 1:17:48.155
I know you're in the closet.

1:17:53.192 --> 1:17:54.194
I'm under the bed.

1:18:04.604 --> 1:18:06.673
Why aren't you at school?

1:18:09.574 --> 1:18:10.676
It's Sunday.

1:18:15.648 --> 1:18:17.516
What are you doing here Abe?

1:18:19.918 --> 1:18:23.189
Do you remember the first
case you ever brought me?

1:18:23.221 --> 1:18:24.056
No.

1:18:26.225 --> 1:18:29.095
Somebody stole the cashbox,
from the school fundraiser.

1:18:30.595 --> 1:18:32.398
That was the last
year we had one.

1:18:33.565 --> 1:18:35.902
I think I might
have made a mistake,

1:18:35.935 --> 1:18:37.237
implicated the wrong kid.

1:18:40.105 --> 1:18:42.842
Who cares? Wasn't
this years ago?

1:18:45.310 --> 1:18:47.313
You found it in his
desk the next day.

1:18:51.583 --> 1:18:52.652
I don't understand.

1:18:54.119 --> 1:18:56.122
You were just testing
me, weren't you?

1:18:58.724 --> 1:19:00.393
Trying to see how
my head worked,

1:19:01.661 --> 1:19:03.697
if I was really as
smart as everyone said.

1:19:05.264 --> 1:19:07.000
Why would I care to do that?

1:19:11.537 --> 1:19:13.340
Gracie was kidnapped
a week later.

1:19:19.979 --> 1:19:21.248
What are you asking me?

1:19:27.420 --> 1:19:29.256
Are you the bad guy?

1:19:33.693 --> 1:19:35.328
I'm an educator, Abe.

1:19:37.496 --> 1:19:40.667
I hope you understand how
even the most outlandish claim

1:19:40.699 --> 1:19:45.704
could tarnish my career, stir
doubts about my character.

1:19:48.573 --> 1:19:51.310
I found the picture, you
stole from Patrick's locker.

1:19:56.582 --> 1:19:58.785
You thought it was
Caroline, didn't you?

1:20:00.953 --> 1:20:02.188
In the tiger mask?

1:20:08.527 --> 1:20:09.328
It wasn't?

1:20:14.800 --> 1:20:15.635
Are you sure?

1:20:17.869 --> 1:20:19.538
I know about
the paper flowers.

1:20:25.644 --> 1:20:26.913
You killed her boyfriend.

1:20:28.747 --> 1:20:32.451
You wanted someone innocent,
untouched, just like Gracie.

1:20:34.153 --> 1:20:35.855
You thought he
ruined her for you.

1:20:41.159 --> 1:20:42.695
Gracie wasn't innocent.

1:20:46.798 --> 1:20:51.704
She used to stop by my office,
just to show me her outfits.

1:20:54.105 --> 1:20:55.375
She was 14.

1:20:57.143 --> 1:20:58.177
Of all people,

1:20:59.645 --> 1:21:02.282
you should appreciate
the relativity of age.

1:21:04.550 --> 1:21:08.387
That girl got what
she always wanted.

1:21:11.323 --> 1:21:13.259
She would have loved
to see this place,

1:21:14.493 --> 1:21:16.629
her face on every
telephone pole,

1:21:18.029 --> 1:21:21.033
people marching through
the marshes, arm in arm.

1:21:22.501 --> 1:21:24.938
For a month, the whole
country knew her name.

1:21:26.671 --> 1:21:27.873
I should have seen it.

1:21:28.807 --> 1:21:29.842
I could've saved her.

1:21:31.844 --> 1:21:32.945
You were just a kid.

1:21:34.979 --> 1:21:36.715
No one expected you to find her.

1:21:39.251 --> 1:21:40.086
She did.

1:21:42.555 --> 1:21:46.092
Abe, I watched you grow up,

1:21:46.125 --> 1:21:49.162
with the weight of the entire
town on your conscience.

1:21:51.197 --> 1:21:53.766
I always felt a
little sorry for you.

1:21:56.734 --> 1:21:58.505
No child could survive that.

1:22:01.239 --> 1:22:02.341
What happened to her?

1:22:06.578 --> 1:22:07.947
She didn't last long.

1:22:09.914 --> 1:22:11.583
Her spirit went soft

1:22:14.052 --> 1:22:15.954
after I gave our daughter away.

1:22:19.390 --> 1:22:20.225
What?

1:22:23.695 --> 1:22:25.164
Everyone knows me here.

1:22:27.132 --> 1:22:30.569
I can't have a newborn
suddenly appear out of nowhere.

1:22:32.270 --> 1:22:35.340
It wasn't easy, leaving
Caroline on the steps

1:22:35.373 --> 1:22:37.309
for those decrepit church mice,

1:22:38.409 --> 1:22:40.447
but I knew they wouldn't
ask any questions.

1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:46.551
My only consolation
was watching her mature

1:22:46.585 --> 1:22:48.822
with such grace and sensibility.

1:22:51.657 --> 1:22:53.460
I took something beautiful,

1:22:55.394 --> 1:22:56.930
but I gave something back,

1:22:59.198 --> 1:23:00.200
something better.

1:23:03.368 --> 1:23:04.871
Balance was restored.

1:23:27.725 --> 1:23:30.796
I was relieved when I first
heard they were dating.

1:23:32.530 --> 1:23:36.603
He seemed sort of
sexless and irrelevant.

1:23:41.673 --> 1:23:43.342
Congratulations, Abe.

1:23:44.643 --> 1:23:46.479
You've solved your first murder.

1:23:49.948 --> 1:23:50.750
What now?

1:24:08.234 --> 1:24:09.335
I'm not afraid of you.

1:24:14.907 --> 1:24:15.975
Nobody is.

1:24:20.078 --> 1:24:22.514
There's a reason I
always obliged you, Abe.

1:24:25.684 --> 1:24:29.221
We both know how it feels when
nobody takes you seriously.

1:24:33.658 --> 1:24:36.496
Now they'll know what
we were capable of.

1:28:00.832 --> 1:28:02.634
Abe?

1:28:05.103 --> 1:28:06.337
I found her.

1:28:06.371 --> 1:28:07.940
What
are you talking about?

1:28:07.972 --> 1:28:09.475
The cat is a boy.

1:28:10.475 --> 1:28:11.277
I found her.

1:28:14.378 --> 1:28:16.114
What?

1:28:16.148 --> 1:28:18.184
She's too scared
to talk to me.

1:28:23.788 --> 1:28:25.023
<i>When I was 32,</i>

1:28:25.056 --> 1:28:27.092
<i>I solved the case of the
Willow Brook kidnapper.</i>

1:28:28.894 --> 1:28:33.699
<i>It was Ellis Erwin,
the evil Principal.</i>

1:29:03.362 --> 1:29:06.364
<i>Gracie's discovery remained a
national news story for weeks.</i>

1:29:09.333 --> 1:29:12.238
<i>I was the "kid detective,"
who never gave up.</i>

1:29:14.672 --> 1:29:16.641
<i>The Governor presented
me with a medal.</i>

1:29:18.644 --> 1:29:20.378
<i>Rory Beans accepted a handshake.</i>

1:29:23.981 --> 1:29:25.784
<i>The widow Gulliver
called me a hero.</i>

1:29:28.753 --> 1:29:31.356
<i>I think her cat is
probably dead though.</i>

1:29:41.365 --> 1:29:45.938
<i>It was like the whole town
returned to color overnight.</i>

1:29:47.139 --> 1:29:49.074
<i>People came out for
the Potato Festival</i>

1:29:49.942 --> 1:29:51.610
<i>for the first time in 18 years.</i>

1:29:52.844 --> 1:29:53.679
Morning, Abe!

1:30:06.591 --> 1:30:07.659
<i>Even
Lucy started looking</i>

1:30:07.693 --> 1:30:08.594
<i>at me differently.</i>

1:30:13.431 --> 1:30:14.266
Wait,

1:30:16.568 --> 1:30:17.603
she's in there.

1:30:36.520 --> 1:30:37.355
Caroline,

1:30:42.159 --> 1:30:43.128
how are you?

1:30:44.930 --> 1:30:45.798
I'm okay.

1:30:58.243 --> 1:30:59.645
What happened to your office?

1:31:02.046 --> 1:31:03.915
I had to take the
old headlines down.

1:31:05.516 --> 1:31:06.652
They looked too stupid.

1:31:08.252 --> 1:31:09.287
Feels pretty empty.

1:31:12.556 --> 1:31:13.759
Are you back at school?

1:31:14.859 --> 1:31:15.694
Not yet.

1:31:17.362 --> 1:31:19.498
That's good. You
should take your time.

1:31:21.932 --> 1:31:23.935
No one really knows
what to say to me.

1:31:27.838 --> 1:31:29.074
And your grandparents?

1:31:31.777 --> 1:31:33.378
They're still pretty confused.

1:31:35.146 --> 1:31:36.448
They thought I was
a gift from Jesus,

1:31:36.480 --> 1:31:38.951
not some pedophile rapist.

1:31:43.087 --> 1:31:43.922
I'm sorry.

1:31:46.891 --> 1:31:48.661
It's not like
you didn't warn me.

1:31:50.228 --> 1:31:52.431
"No matter how simple
a case may seem,

1:31:53.597 --> 1:31:55.067
it's always shocking
what you find."

1:31:56.201 --> 1:31:57.703
I was just being pretentious.

1:31:58.837 --> 1:32:02.807
Still, isn't it better
to know the truth?

1:32:12.117 --> 1:32:13.719
Well, at least you saved Gracie.

1:32:15.453 --> 1:32:16.287
Yeah, sort of.

1:32:18.756 --> 1:32:20.326
Has she reached out to you yet?

1:32:22.327 --> 1:32:23.362
She's just a kid.

1:32:41.512 --> 1:32:42.347
Hi.

1:32:46.051 --> 1:32:47.886
Can I get you a
tea or something?

1:32:47.918 --> 1:32:49.622
Oh, no thank you, we're okay.

1:32:56.627 --> 1:32:59.831
How are
you enjoying the extra space?

1:32:59.864 --> 1:33:00.666
It's great.

1:33:02.367 --> 1:33:04.235
Not a little
lonely without Corey?

1:33:06.404 --> 1:33:08.174
- He was kind of a deadbeat.
- Oh.

1:33:10.574 --> 1:33:11.543
It's so tidy.

1:33:13.310 --> 1:33:15.012
Yeah, I hired a cleaning lady.

1:33:15.046 --> 1:33:18.450
Oh.

1:33:18.483 --> 1:33:20.720
Oh, did you see you were
in another magazine?

1:33:23.054 --> 1:33:25.257
It's a story that
touches people.

1:33:25.289 --> 1:33:26.891
Getting any money out of that?

1:33:28.793 --> 1:33:30.028
It's good for business.

1:33:31.229 --> 1:33:33.766
You, um, you seem tired.

1:33:35.699 --> 1:33:38.737
Yeah, I've been having
a little trouble sleeping.

1:33:38.770 --> 1:33:41.073
Why? What's wrong?

1:33:41.105 --> 1:33:41.940
It's nothing.

1:33:43.175 --> 1:33:44.476
The floor creaks at night.

1:33:49.381 --> 1:33:52.551
You know they um, they
called us for a quote,

1:33:52.583 --> 1:33:53.685
I hope you don't mind.

1:34:06.398 --> 1:34:07.500
Are you alright?

1:34:16.341 --> 1:34:18.710
Abe.

1:34:18.743 --> 1:34:21.980
What's the matter?
