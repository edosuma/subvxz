<i>You can leave your skis
on the rack outside at night</i>

<i>and there is a spot for your
boots and other gear</i>

00:42.777 --> 00:44.510

morning from 7:00 to 10:00</i>

00:47.248 --> 00:48.291
and make sure you check

00:48.315 --> 00:50.060
the daily activities board
because as of tomorrow

00:50.084 --> 00:52.451
we'll have a new activity
planned every day.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.431
We like to make a big deal
out of Christmas.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.120
We heard.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.266
We're friends of the Talbots.

00:56.290 --> 00:56.955
Oh.

00:56.991 --> 00:57.523
They're checking in tomorrow.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.058
They come every year.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.103
This is actually where they met.

01:00.127 --> 01:00.726
I know.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.961
Debbie calls it a miracle.

01:02.997 --> 01:03.929
Does she?

01:03.964 --> 01:05.497
That's funny, 'cause so do we.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.400
I'm Sophie Bennett,
the owner, and this is Callie.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.268
Elise.

01:09.303 --> 01:09.968
Dan.

01:10.004 --> 01:11.148
Nice to have you both with us.

01:11.172 --> 01:15.007
Listen, you need anything
at all you let us know, ok?

01:15.042 --> 01:15.374
Got it.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.375
Thank you.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.744
So your room is just up
the stairs to the left.

01:18.779 --> 01:19.511
Ok.

01:19.547 --> 01:20.779
Thank you.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.960
So who else is checking
in today?

01:23.984 --> 01:25.584
Well, a bunch of the regulars.

01:25.619 --> 01:26.997
But I also wanted
to talk to you.

01:27.021 --> 01:28.932
The Mackenzies haven't paid
their deposit yet.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.790
I talked to them about it and
they're gonna get us next year.

01:31.826 --> 01:33.092
So don't bill 'em, ok?

01:33.127 --> 01:33.459
Ok.

01:33.494 --> 01:34.693
Who else?

01:34.728 --> 01:36.328
Uh, let's see.

01:36.363 --> 01:37.596
Oh, Gary's coming in today.

01:37.631 --> 01:38.297
Yay!

01:38.332 --> 01:39.443
And we got a bunch of newbies.

01:39.467 --> 01:42.935
Callie, please do not tell them
about the miracle, ok?

01:42.970 --> 01:43.869
It's true.

01:43.904 --> 01:44.369
It's not-

01:44.405 --> 01:45.504
It is.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.451
Every year that I've been here
somebody gets a gift.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.708
They get exactly what they need
out of nowhere.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.610
It's not miraculous.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.045
Gary got a job three years ago.

01:53.080 --> 01:53.879
That was lucky.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.792
The Talbots met,
you introduced them.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.694
That was just a thing
that happens.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.351
Every year?

02:00.221 --> 02:01.520
Coincidence.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.788
My version is more fun.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.356
It is.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.958
It definitely is.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.794
I smell something delicious.

02:09.830 --> 02:10.529
Of course.

02:10.564 --> 02:11.864
Ooh! My cookies!

02:11.899 --> 02:13.198
Oh, I gotta go.

02:22.409 --> 02:23.487
No, I'll cover for you.

02:23.511 --> 02:27.479
You just go have a great
Christmas with your family.

02:27.515 --> 02:28.814
Uh-huh.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.249
Bye.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.728
And how are you gonna
double up your work?

02:31.752 --> 02:35.420
Oh, I can, uh, take care of
this new thing

02:35.456 --> 02:38.157
and then fly to Indonesia
on the 25th.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.725
Ah, on Christmas day?

02:39.760 --> 02:40.804
That's a perfect day to fly.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.995
Think you can finish this
new deal before then?

02:43.030 --> 02:44.696
What sir Ian wants-

02:44.732 --> 02:45.597
He gets.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.766
Ah, there's a man
after my own heart.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.101
And a holiday bonus.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.235
Happy to do it.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.703
Oh, it is fun, isn't it?

02:51.739 --> 02:52.571
Don't you love your job?

02:52.606 --> 02:53.539
I do.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.941
But I gotta ask why this
property so sudden?

02:55.976 --> 02:59.111
I saw an ad for the lodge
and I had a feeling.

02:59.146 --> 03:03.615
Like yesterday, I flew over
the mountain and I knew.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.618
Waves emanated all
the way up to the plane.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.086
Oh, I can smell it!

03:08.122 --> 03:09.888
A perfect hidden little gem.

03:09.924 --> 03:10.924
Out of the way.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.090
Exclusive.

03:12.126 --> 03:13.325
Or, it will be.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.628
Sounds great, but uh, without
more background can we just-

03:16.664 --> 03:18.542
That's why I need you
on the ground there.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.566
I want this property, Evan.

03:20.601 --> 03:21.978
Now, I have to fly out
myself tonight

03:22.002 --> 03:24.770
so this is your baby
to deliver.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.405
Trust your instincts.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.639
Emma?

03:27.675 --> 03:29.808
Trust instincts.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.243
And get it in writing.

03:31.278 --> 03:33.145
Emma, I need goji berries

03:33.180 --> 03:34.958
<i>and the satellite feed
straight into...</i>

03:34.982 --> 03:35.982
I'll say it.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.482
I love that man.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.817
He should love you, too.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.953
Nobody else would go
on 10 minutes notice.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.388
Uh, here is what I could
pull so far.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.323
I'm gonna keep digging.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.758
The lodge was built
in the early '70's.

03:46.794 --> 03:47.904
It's a family-run business,

03:47.928 --> 03:49.406
behind on the mortgage
for months.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.064
The mortgage is
with Western Savings.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.410
How do we know it's
a private business?

03:53.434 --> 03:55.512
Frank Dunlop, he's the loan
manager there,

03:55.536 --> 03:57.569
he was very eager
to give us that info.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.570
He wants to do a deal.

03:58.606 --> 04:01.240
He's gonna be looking for you,
so be in touch.

04:02.176 --> 04:03.520
Well, it sounds like
an easy acquisition.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.076
Should be.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.644
Book me on the red-eye.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.814
Um... I should be in and out
in two days.

04:08.849 --> 04:09.615
Ok.

04:09.650 --> 04:10.282
Meg?

04:10.317 --> 04:11.250
Yeah.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.784
Merry Christmas.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.386
Merry Christmas.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.629
Snow looks great up there.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.837
Hey, Vince, thank you
for stopping by.

04:31.872 --> 04:32.638
Hey, yeah.

04:32.673 --> 04:33.505
No problem.

04:33.540 --> 04:34.985
I had the early shift
on ski patrol.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.108
I was on the way home.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.153
Pass me that wrench.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.277
Sure.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.179
So, uh, what's the verdict?

04:41.215 --> 04:45.017
Well, I got your engine cleaned,
re-built your carburetor.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.863
That should get you through
the season,

04:46.887 --> 04:49.032
but next year you have to look
at replacing the whole unit.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.222
What's that gonna cost?

04:50.257 --> 04:50.856
Well-

04:50.891 --> 04:52.524
No, don't-don't tell me.

04:52.559 --> 04:53.792
It's Christmas.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.127
I'll just think about it later.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.128
Ok.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.829
What do I owe you?

04:57.865 --> 04:59.064
Why do you even try, Soph?

04:59.099 --> 05:00.910
You know I've never taken
a dime off you.

05:00.934 --> 05:01.833
I know.

05:01.869 --> 05:02.701
Thank you.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.670
But I have to pay
you back somehow.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.171
Maybe with food?

05:06.206 --> 05:08.173
Callie's baking.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.474
Cal-Callie's baking?

05:09.510 --> 05:10.475
Yeah.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.711
Yeah, I-I could go help out.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.512
And I think she needs a taster.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.413
I can be a taster.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.714
Excuse me.

05:17.217 --> 05:17.749
Thank you.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.885
Yeah, you're welcome.

06:03.731 --> 06:04.896
Well, I hope it works out!

06:04.932 --> 06:06.098
Merry Christmas.

06:06.967 --> 06:07.766
Hello.

06:07.801 --> 06:08.734
Hello.

06:08.769 --> 06:09.434
Art.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.535
Yes, that is me.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.571
Welcome to Overton.

06:11.605 --> 06:12.949
Are you here
for the holidays?

06:12.973 --> 06:14.451
Uh, I'm looking
for the Holly Lodge?

06:14.475 --> 06:16.453
Ah, then you are definitely
here for the holidays.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.442
Sophie does 'em right.

06:17.478 --> 06:18.643
It's a nice place to stay?

06:18.679 --> 06:20.645
Well, between us, it's uh...

06:20.681 --> 06:21.891
it's my favourite place
on the mountain.

06:21.915 --> 06:22.647
You chose well.

06:22.683 --> 06:23.548
Yeah.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.450
Well, I'd love to find it.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.719
My GPS gave out at exit 12.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.232
Well, your phone
did better than most.

06:29.256 --> 06:30.800
Usually folks only
make it to exit 5

06:30.824 --> 06:32.068
so you're ahead
of the game.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.592
Alright, you ready?

06:33.627 --> 06:34.459
You're gonna take the main
road back to the highway.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.460
Yeah.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.573
Then you're gonna go left
on the state road.

06:36.597 --> 06:39.297
And go right at the four-way
and left again on 314.

06:39.333 --> 06:40.232
You're gonna see
a little icy field.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.278
You're gonna go past that.
Way past that.

06:42.302 --> 06:43.346
There's a duck pond past that.

06:43.370 --> 06:44.681
You're gonna turn right
at the end of that street.

06:44.705 --> 06:45.815
It's a T, you can't miss it.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.005
Yes.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.119
About a mile past that you're
gonna see it on your left.

06:49.143 --> 06:50.041
Ok.

06:50.077 --> 06:50.976
I feel like I should write
it down for ya.

06:51.011 --> 06:51.777
No, I got it.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.089
Ok, but if you don't,
I'm here.

06:53.113 --> 06:53.712
Thank you very much.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.480
Alright. Merry Christmas.

06:56.350 --> 06:57.149
Nadine!

06:57.184 --> 06:58.350
Oooh.

06:58.385 --> 06:59.751
I am so glad you came.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.586
Awe.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.136
Can't let you have Christmas
without me.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.559
No, you can't.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.863
What...?

07:11.899 --> 07:14.199
I had to make sure I didn't
forget anything.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.268
You know Harry did
all the packing.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.335
All the planning.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.771
All the lists.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.707
I remember.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.109
Merry Christmas, baby.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.710
It is, now.

07:25.746 --> 07:26.990
You know, there
are whole lot of folks

07:27.014 --> 07:28.647
who can't wait to see you.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.115
They're gonna be so happy.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.550
Are you ready for that?

07:31.585 --> 07:33.285
I was born ready.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.352
Let's do this.

07:34.388 --> 07:35.053
Yeah.

07:35.088 --> 07:35.787
Oooh.

07:35.823 --> 07:36.888
Woah.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.423
[laughs]

07:39.660 --> 07:40.670
Just put it down right there.

07:40.694 --> 07:41.827
Nadine, I got it.

07:41.862 --> 07:42.527
Ok.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.361
Whew.

07:43.397 --> 07:44.397
Where is everybody?

07:44.431 --> 07:45.897
Nadine!

07:45.933 --> 07:47.065
Callie.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.667
So good to see you.

07:48.702 --> 07:51.503
Awe, I have missed
your cooking.

07:51.538 --> 07:52.337
Oh, good.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.338
You can help me
with the turkey gravy.

07:53.373 --> 07:56.041
Mmmhmm, 'cause you could
never get that right.

07:56.076 --> 07:56.975
Ohh.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.177
Nadine!

07:59.213 --> 08:00.890
You gorgeous woman,
come here.

08:00.914 --> 08:04.549
Oh, Gary got a year younger.

08:04.585 --> 08:07.052
How'd you do that?
How'd he do that?

08:07.087 --> 08:09.521
All with smoke and mirrors.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.223
I am so sorry about-

08:11.258 --> 08:12.057
Mmm-mmm.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.725
He is still with me.

08:13.760 --> 08:14.526
Mmmhmm.

08:14.561 --> 08:15.727
<i>Nadine?</i>

08:15.762 --> 08:16.695
<i>I thought I heard you.</i>

08:16.730 --> 08:18.663
Oh, you too.

08:21.568 --> 08:24.870
Oh, Kyle, awe.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.372
Baby, you're so big.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.708
We're gonna cut down
a Christmas tree!

08:29.743 --> 08:31.042
<i>(Nadine): We are?</i>

08:31.078 --> 08:33.188
<i>(Kyle): I'm gonna pick it
and you're gonna carry it.</i>

08:33.212 --> 08:35.547
<i>[laughter]</i>

08:35.582 --> 08:37.559
<i>(Sophie): Well that guy's
deciding the rules.</i>

08:37.583 --> 08:38.216
Perfect.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.417
He's got jobs for everyone.

08:39.453 --> 08:40.453
<i>[laughs]</i>

08:40.486 --> 08:42.053
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

08:58.839 --> 09:00.519
[clears throat]
Right.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.241
Got it, thank you.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.244
Welcome to Holly Lodge.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.312
Just checking in?

09:07.347 --> 09:12.217
Uh, I'm booked, but uh...
is this a private party?

09:12.252 --> 09:14.219
What?

09:14.254 --> 09:15.254
Oh, no.

09:15.289 --> 09:16.329
It's just Christmas.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.055
<i>Really?</i>

09:17.090 --> 09:18.256
<i>Yeah, everyone's invited.</i>

09:18.292 --> 09:18.957
<i>Ok.</i>

09:18.992 --> 09:20.559
I'm Sophie.

09:21.862 --> 09:22.661
Uh, Bennett.

09:22.696 --> 09:23.795
I'm Sophie Bennett.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.897
I'm-I'm the owner here.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.065
You're-you're the owner?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.133
Yep.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.335
And your name is...?

09:30.370 --> 09:31.636
Evan.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.437
Evan.

09:32.472 --> 09:33.305
Right.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.606
Ok, so, Evan-

09:34.641 --> 09:37.075
Oh, Evan uh, sorry,
Evan Hunter.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.488
<i>Evan Hunter.
I see you.</i>

09:38.512 --> 09:39.244
That's me.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.078
Last minute booking.

09:40.113 --> 09:40.679
Yeah.

09:40.714 --> 09:41.580
New York.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.414
Mmmhmm.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.416
And we only have you
for two nights.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.383
Yeah.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.286
I guess you hadn't heard
about our Christmas.

09:48.322 --> 09:49.387
No, I didn't.

09:49.423 --> 09:53.825
Um... I just, uh, came to get
in some quick skiing

09:53.860 --> 09:57.963
and it's a working trip,
so...

09:57.998 --> 09:59.130
We have WiFi.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.365
Great.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.299
I love WiFi.

10:01.335 --> 10:04.135
And if you need anything else,
uh, we'll-

10:04.171 --> 10:05.437
we'll do our best.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.973
I'm good with my laptop.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.008
Great, perfect.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.243
Uh...

10:12.279 --> 10:13.011
I should show you
to your room.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.312
Yeah.

10:14.348 --> 10:15.458
Um, I'll-uh, get the key.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.716
Uh, we have you here.

10:17.751 --> 10:18.683
Uh... Room 12.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.551
It's just up the stairs.

10:19.586 --> 10:20.285
Up here?

10:20.320 --> 10:21.019
Yep.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.320
Alright.

10:23.223 --> 10:23.722
You can go first.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.523
Oh, ok. Yeah, sure.

10:25.559 --> 10:26.391
Just up here?

10:26.426 --> 10:28.304
Yeah, just up the stairs
to the right.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.694
You're blushing.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.196
(whispers) I don't blush.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.497
You're definitely blushing.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.099
Stop it, ok.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.983
What's the deal
with Christmas?

10:40.007 --> 10:41.250
Oh, it's kind of a thing
around here.

10:41.274 --> 10:46.211
We have a lot of regulars and,
uh, we do a lot of activities.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.045
Uh-huh.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.214
Here's your key.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.649
That's cute.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.017
Thank you.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.553
If you'd like to join us,
we're gonna go tree shopping.

10:55.589 --> 10:57.322
Oh, that's tempting but uh...

10:57.357 --> 10:59.235
It'll only take an hour.
Two hours, tops.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.737
And then you get
to meet everyone.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.028
And then you can come back here,
into your room,

11:03.063 --> 11:04.496
and no one will bother you.

11:04.531 --> 11:07.499
I mean, it's not like anyone
would intrude...

11:07.534 --> 11:10.902
except that that's
what I'm doing right now.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.437
No, no, not at all.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.217
Well, we're leaving
in about 15 minutes

11:14.241 --> 11:17.742
so if you change your mind,
come on down.

11:17.778 --> 11:18.778
Will do.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.045
Ok.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.082
Come on down?

11:24.117 --> 11:26.418
What am I, a gameshow host?

11:26.453 --> 11:29.154
I just slammed the door
right in her face.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.260
Uh, so when you said
"tree shopping"...

11:35.295 --> 11:36.606
You thought I meant
a tree lot?

11:36.630 --> 11:37.128
Pretty much.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.063
[laughs]

11:38.098 --> 11:39.709
So you just pick one out,
chop it down,

11:39.733 --> 11:41.444
you don't need permission
or anything?

11:41.468 --> 11:43.301
Well, we own the land.

11:43.336 --> 11:46.771
Wait, you own the mountain?

11:46.807 --> 11:48.606
Not the whole thing.

11:48.642 --> 11:51.309
But this part's been in my
family for four generations.

11:51.344 --> 11:54.145
They put it in a trust
a long time ago.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.125
Well, the lodge doesn't seem
that old.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.249
No, that was my parent's
dream house.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.385
They built it
before I was born.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.787
Hey, you want a Frasier?

12:02.823 --> 12:04.089
Yeah, if they're tall enough.

12:04.124 --> 12:04.889
Look at this.

12:04.925 --> 12:05.757
Yeah.

12:05.792 --> 12:06.324
Is this the one that you-

12:06.359 --> 12:08.893
Yeah. I planted that.

12:08.929 --> 12:09.828
Wow.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.808
Well, I mean, one
of these three, right?

12:11.832 --> 12:12.464
Yeah, sure.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.599
What do you think,
Evan?

12:14.634 --> 12:17.669
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, sure.

12:17.704 --> 12:20.438
My dad planted
that whole stand.

12:20.474 --> 12:21.139
Seriously?

12:21.174 --> 12:22.240
Yeah.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.686
Remember when I used to name
them when I was little?

12:23.710 --> 12:24.609
Right.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.255
But then we can never cut
those ones down.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.078
Right.

12:27.114 --> 12:27.979
Yeah.

12:28.014 --> 12:28.480
But this one we can.
What do you think?

12:28.515 --> 12:29.515
There's no holes.

12:29.549 --> 12:30.315
It looks great.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.761
Yeah, it's a good,
straight trunk.

12:31.785 --> 12:32.617
Yeah.

12:32.652 --> 12:33.485
I think this is the one.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.152
This is it.

12:34.187 --> 12:34.552
Yeah.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.354
Let's do it.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.990
Here, uh, let me-
let me get that.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.425
Ok.

12:41.862 --> 12:42.327
Hiya!

12:42.362 --> 12:43.661
Oh, Evan, no, no.

12:43.697 --> 12:44.596
Uh, you don't have
to do that.

12:44.631 --> 12:45.430
Oh, no, no.

12:45.465 --> 12:46.631
No, this is great.

12:46.666 --> 12:49.100
I haven't, uh, got to chop
anything down in a long time.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.835
No, Evan, stop-it-

12:50.871 --> 12:53.505
the axe is just to clear
the lower branches.

12:57.377 --> 12:57.942
Right.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.077
Right.

12:59.679 --> 13:00.845
Yeah.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.457
[laughs]

13:12.492 --> 13:14.192
It was they key, right?

13:14.227 --> 13:17.095
It threw you that it wasn't
one of those modern key cards.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.197
It is charming.

13:19.232 --> 13:22.300
I like the brochure word:
rustic.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.379
But now that you've seen
an axe

13:23.403 --> 13:28.006
you're gonna expect butter
churning and buggies.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.408
At least a one-horse
open sleigh.

13:31.411 --> 13:32.777
Now that I would love.

13:32.813 --> 13:36.014
[chainsaw buzzing]

13:36.983 --> 13:39.484
Oh, gosh, I don't know.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.553
A long, long, long time.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.022
[laughs]

13:44.057 --> 13:46.724
Nadine, how many years
you been coming here?

13:46.760 --> 13:50.662
Hmm... Sophie was three
when we first came.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.697
Liz and David invited us.

13:52.732 --> 13:57.135
Harry and I had just purchased
our place on the eastern slope.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.254
My husband passed away
this year.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.645
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.280
Thank you.

14:11.785 --> 14:14.185
All of you seem so close here.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.687
That's because we are.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.822
Liz and David made it that way.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.490
Who are Liz and David?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.025
Sophie's parents.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.393
They're gone now.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.029
Car accident when Sophie
was in college.

14:25.065 --> 14:28.900
She's been running this place
on her own for 15 years now.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.268
That's...

14:30.303 --> 14:32.670
Very difficult.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.750
But there's been a lot of love
around that girl.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.242
Always has been,
always will.

14:37.277 --> 14:42.513
So she just runs the whole
place all by herself?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.015
Yes.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.617
She's single.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.818
Uh...

14:49.890 --> 14:52.590
[chuckles]

14:52.626 --> 14:53.658
No, I-

14:53.693 --> 14:56.928
[stutters] I didn't mean that,
I was just, uh...

14:56.963 --> 14:57.929
[clears throat]

14:57.964 --> 15:00.098
No, I just...

15:00.133 --> 15:01.477
I was thinking that it must
be really hard

15:01.501 --> 15:03.134
to keep this place going.

15:03.169 --> 15:06.070
Well, it's hard work
and she works hard.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.372
But she loves it.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.040
Mmm.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.076
Hey, can I, uh, give you
a hand with that?

15:12.112 --> 15:13.823
Take this candle and
set it down right there.

15:13.847 --> 15:15.546
Alright.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.482
Hold the candle...

15:17.517 --> 15:20.518
<i>Just like that?</i>

15:21.922 --> 15:23.254
<i>This way or this way?</i>

15:23.290 --> 15:25.423
Everyone, I found
more ornaments!

15:25.458 --> 15:26.669
Who wants to help
me decorate?

15:26.693 --> 15:27.725
Me!

15:27.761 --> 15:29.761
<i>Yeah!</i>

15:32.933 --> 15:34.232
Yeah, that looks great there.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.434
Perfect.

15:43.343 --> 15:46.110
Ah, missed a spot.

15:46.146 --> 15:49.247
No, that's the spot we leave
for the winning ornament.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.193
We have an
ornament-making contest.

15:51.217 --> 15:52.450
Ah.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.697
I like the idea that everybody
has a little bit of themselves

15:54.721 --> 15:56.254
on the tree.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.500
So you have to start thinking
about it.

15:57.524 --> 15:58.990
Will do.

16:01.027 --> 16:03.027
Ok, what about that one?

16:03.063 --> 16:06.297
That one right there,
is my very first ornament.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.066
I got it when I was two.

16:09.336 --> 16:12.537
Wait, you have one
for every year?

16:12.572 --> 16:13.538
Yep.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.139
It was my mom's idea.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.942
She um... wanted me to have
this great collection

16:17.978 --> 16:20.345
for when I moved out.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.981
And now I have theirs.

16:24.351 --> 16:29.053
So uh...

16:29.089 --> 16:31.990
all the people who come
here every Christmas,

16:32.025 --> 16:34.692
they're all on their own, too?

16:34.728 --> 16:35.760
One way or another.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.997
Gary was a long time family
friend of my parents

16:39.032 --> 16:41.332
and he and Nadine
and her husband,

16:41.368 --> 16:43.167
they would come every year.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.870
Then when my parents passed
away I didn't have a plan.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.505
I didn't know what to do

16:47.540 --> 16:50.074
and they just showed up
at Christmas.

16:50.110 --> 16:50.875
[laughs]

16:50.910 --> 16:52.755
And they brought
all their friends.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.812
They really saved me
that year.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.648
And, um, it just grew
from there, you know?

16:57.684 --> 17:00.251
Word of mouth.

17:00.286 --> 17:01.831
What were your
Christmases like?

17:01.855 --> 17:03.265
I had a lot of freedom
as a kid.

17:03.289 --> 17:04.122
Really?

17:04.156 --> 17:05.667
What did you do
with all that freedom?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.425
I explored.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.327
We traveled a lot.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.194
I still do, actually.

17:11.231 --> 17:15.032
What was the best
Christmas trip ever?

17:15.068 --> 17:16.534
Hmm.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.103
Oh, Roatán was nice.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.070
I don't know it.

17:20.106 --> 17:22.373
Oh, it-it's this beautiful
little island

17:22.409 --> 17:24.342
off the coast of Honduras.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.779
For a long time only divers
knew about it,

17:27.814 --> 17:31.215
but now I mean, there's a ferry
that goes out to the island,

17:31.251 --> 17:33.451
there's an airport, resorts.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.420
So you mean they ruined it?

17:35.455 --> 17:37.688
No, no. It's great.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.457
It's just easier to get to.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.258
How about you?

17:40.293 --> 17:41.259
Do you travel?

17:41.294 --> 17:42.427
I don't much.

17:42.462 --> 17:45.797
I mean, not that I wouldn't
want to but I'm busy here,

17:45.832 --> 17:46.864
you know.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.266
Hmm.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.005
You know, it's snowing tonight.

17:55.642 --> 17:56.607
Yeah.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.487
So, um, there's gonna be
great skiing tomorrow.

17:58.511 --> 17:59.277
Yeah.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.956
Unfortunately I have work
to do.

18:00.980 --> 18:03.147
Well, you did say you came here
to ski, too.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.549
I did say that.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.316
Yeah.

18:05.351 --> 18:06.651
Yeah.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.119
Um, you know what?

18:08.154 --> 18:10.888
I'm gonna take the morning off,
call it research.

18:10.924 --> 18:11.756
[laughs]

18:11.791 --> 18:12.723
Yeah.

18:12.759 --> 18:13.759
Good idea.

18:13.793 --> 18:14.625
But you should take the day.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.595
I mean, it's your
one full day here.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.630
Yeesh. One day.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.801
That sounds very wrong.

18:25.171 --> 18:26.737
Very.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.007
Hey.

18:30.043 --> 18:31.476
You think maybe the management

18:31.511 --> 18:33.945
will let me stay on
through Christmas?

18:33.980 --> 18:36.647
I think I have some
connections here.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.204
Hey, what do you think
about Evan?

19:00.240 --> 19:01.105
Seems like a good guy.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.039
Mmmhmm.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.119
Look at Sophie this morning.

19:03.143 --> 19:05.476
Yeah, look at Sophie work.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.578
I think he meant
you are glowing.

19:07.614 --> 19:08.379
That's sweat.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.581
Relax, everyone.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.583
Really, he's a great guy.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.285
But he's leaving in a week.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.052
Wait, wait, wait.

19:15.088 --> 19:15.920
A week?

19:15.955 --> 19:19.457
You mean he's not
leaving tomorrow?

19:19.492 --> 19:20.492
No.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.638
He decided he wants to stay
through Christmas.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.662
Oh.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.396
Huh.

19:25.431 --> 19:27.265
Put those looks away.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.233
Both of you.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.272
Somebody has a crush.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.072
Mmm.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.541
Mmmhmm.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.163
Hey!

19:59.199 --> 20:01.299
Lucia and Zoe!

20:01.334 --> 20:03.534
Welcome back to Holly Lodge,
you two!

20:03.570 --> 20:04.835
Thank you.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.115
I was afraid we wouldn't
make it through

20:06.139 --> 20:07.616
but the driver followed
the snow plough.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.374
Zoe, you have gotten so big
just since last year.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.577
Yeah, thanks.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.848
I hope it's a phase.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.562
Listen, I'm so glad
you both are here,

20:19.586 --> 20:22.820
but I know it means that you're
on your own this Christmas.

20:22.855 --> 20:23.955
I'm sorry.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.734
Francisco's stationed somewhere
in the Helmand province

20:25.758 --> 20:28.292
and it's the third Christmas
in a row.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.528
I think it's why
Zoe's been so...

20:30.563 --> 20:31.462
Well, listen.

20:31.497 --> 20:32.575
You're here
with us now.

20:32.599 --> 20:35.399
You're gonna have a fantastic
holiday, I promise.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.603
I put you in room 11
so you have plenty of space.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.138
That's what you wear to ski?

20:42.709 --> 20:43.374
I'll find my own room.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.409
Ok.

20:44.444 --> 20:48.913
Um... no, I-I have work
to do.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.382
So you convinced me
to play hooky

20:51.417 --> 20:53.162
but now you're just gonna
stay here?

20:53.186 --> 20:54.018
Really?

20:54.053 --> 20:55.731
You excite people to go
have tons of fun

20:55.755 --> 20:57.655
while you mind the store?

20:57.690 --> 20:58.489
Yes.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.758
That is actually
my job description.

21:00.793 --> 21:01.559
Nope.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.727
Nope, I'm not buying it.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.195
Wait, wait, I know what it is.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.242
You're scared that you
can't keep up with me.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.899
Yes, you've figured out
my secret shame.

21:08.935 --> 21:09.700
Yep.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.513
I grew up on a ski slope
and yet...

21:11.537 --> 21:13.037
[whispers] I can't ski.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.184
Don't worry, we'll find
something your speed.

21:15.208 --> 21:16.540
Hey, guys.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.187
Fresh powder.
Let's go.

21:18.211 --> 21:19.510
Come join us.

21:19.545 --> 21:20.678
See?

21:20.713 --> 21:21.545
You're out-numbered.

21:21.581 --> 21:22.613
You're out-voted.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.715
Resistance is futile.

21:24.751 --> 21:25.683
Come on.

21:25.718 --> 21:26.417
One run.

21:26.452 --> 21:27.118
Alright.

21:27.153 --> 21:27.885
Ok.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.020
Ok.

21:29.055 --> 21:29.887
Just give me a chance
to change.

21:29.922 --> 21:30.922
Ok.

21:34.227 --> 21:34.759
Are you ready?

21:34.794 --> 21:35.860
What is this, a race?

21:35.895 --> 21:37.228
Of course not.

21:37.263 --> 21:38.362
Ok.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.297
Yew!

21:39.332 --> 21:40.865
Oh, hey!

21:53.980 --> 21:57.615
Well, not bad
for a weekend skier.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.718
Seriously though,
I'm just relieved

22:00.753 --> 22:01.997
that I could keep up
with you.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.454
You did great.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.322
Ah...

22:04.357 --> 22:06.390
I'll see you later.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.191
Wait, wait, wait.

22:07.226 --> 22:09.138
Wait, that's all the fun
for today?

22:09.162 --> 22:10.661
Go find the family.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.296
Try to keep up with them.

22:38.324 --> 22:41.592
So, about those late notices
that you keep sending me...

22:41.627 --> 22:42.560
It breaks my heart.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.795
You've beaten the odds
a long time, Sophie.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.031
Times have been tough
for everyone in this town.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.866
No snow, no customers.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.335
But this is a great season
and I'm gonna make it back.

22:51.371 --> 22:55.673
I just-I just need
a little more time.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.275
I'll see what I can do.

22:58.311 --> 23:00.177
Thanks.

23:22.502 --> 23:23.634
Pack it in there.

23:23.669 --> 23:25.669
Yeah. Great.

23:26.939 --> 23:30.908
Wow. These look great!

23:30.943 --> 23:34.078
Alright, keep-
keep packing that in.

23:34.113 --> 23:35.646
Looking good.

23:35.681 --> 23:36.580
Hey.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.849
Hey.

23:38.885 --> 23:42.420
Can you help me out with,
uh, with that one there?

23:42.455 --> 23:44.188
What, that one right there?

23:44.223 --> 23:46.991
You can't tell what that is?

23:47.026 --> 23:47.691
No.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.760
No, that's not how this works.

23:49.796 --> 23:53.197
Tell me about your snowman,
Evan.

23:53.232 --> 23:56.066
Kyle and I are making
a superhero Santa.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.034
Oh.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.837
I mean, the cape is...
it's a bit abstract,

23:59.872 --> 24:02.339
but if you squint, right?

24:02.375 --> 24:03.941
Yeah, totally.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.376
Hey! Kyle!

24:05.411 --> 24:07.878
Great superhero!

24:12.118 --> 24:13.951
You're really good at this.

24:13.986 --> 24:16.253
Yeah. Who knew?

24:23.996 --> 24:26.036
Hey, listen, they were out
of asparagus

24:26.065 --> 24:27.443
but I they did have plenty
of broccoli,

24:27.467 --> 24:29.900
which the kids love anyway,
so I...

24:30.903 --> 24:32.069
Callie?

24:32.104 --> 24:32.937
Callie.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.239
What is wrong-
did something happen?

24:35.274 --> 24:36.552
Ok, first of all,
I want you to know

24:36.576 --> 24:38.220
that I did not go looking
for this.

24:38.244 --> 24:40.389
I just went into his room
and I lift up his laptop

24:40.413 --> 24:42.224
to dust underneath it
and then it turned itself on

24:42.248 --> 24:42.947
and there it was.

24:42.982 --> 24:43.781
Wait, no.

24:43.816 --> 24:44.715
Wait, who's laptop?

24:44.750 --> 24:47.284
And... what?

24:47.320 --> 24:48.752
Evan's.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.855
And... this.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.135
I'm sorry, I didn't wanna
touch anything

24:53.159 --> 24:56.093
so I only got a screen cap
of the first page.

24:59.599 --> 25:03.267
"Initial research didn't show it
but owner had title"

25:03.302 --> 25:07.304
"to significant
mountain acreage,"

25:07.340 --> 25:09.974
"now held in trust
do a name search"

25:10.009 --> 25:13.277
"and research usage rights."

25:13.312 --> 25:16.814
"No assessment yet of
owner's willingness to sell."

25:17.884 --> 25:19.149
[sighs]

25:19.185 --> 25:20.829
"Proximity to slopes
but enough shelter"

25:20.853 --> 25:23.587
"from the ski lodge
makes the location"

25:23.623 --> 25:27.658
"perfect for the elite brand."

25:32.565 --> 25:33.664
Elite brand?

25:33.699 --> 25:35.766
Elite resort.

25:35.801 --> 25:38.836
I did a search as soon as
I found it.

25:40.506 --> 25:41.405
It's a privately-held company

25:41.440 --> 25:44.275
owned by this Brit named
Sir lain Somersby,

25:44.310 --> 25:46.944
who kite surfs
and owns an island

25:46.979 --> 25:49.446
and builds space shuttles.

25:49.482 --> 25:52.950
Anyways, their speciality
is buying boutique properties

25:52.985 --> 25:55.719
and turning them into elite,
upscale resorts.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.121
So that's why he's here.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.523
That's why he's being so...

26:02.762 --> 26:04.695
It's business.

26:04.730 --> 26:05.563
I'm sorry, Sophie.

26:05.598 --> 26:08.365
I could see how much fun
you were having.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.034
Please don't be sorry.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.535
I'm glad I know.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.515
I'm not gonna let some clowns
take my home

26:13.539 --> 26:15.183
and turn it into
an elite resort.

26:15.207 --> 26:16.507
Yeah. Good.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.387
You go and give him
a piece of your mind.

26:18.411 --> 26:20.088
Ooh, and I will throw all
his clothes out the window!

26:20.112 --> 26:21.823
Wait, unless you wanna throw
his clothes out the window.

26:21.847 --> 26:22.913
No.

26:22.949 --> 26:24.248
No, I can't afford to-

26:24.283 --> 26:25.883
You can't afford to what?

26:25.918 --> 26:28.252
Let Evan know that
we're on to him, right?

26:28.287 --> 26:30.588
And that gives us
an advantage.

26:30.623 --> 26:31.855
What advantage?

26:31.891 --> 26:32.856
Why don't you just go out there
and give him a piece of your-

26:32.892 --> 26:33.924
No, I can't.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.359
I can't lose this place.

26:35.394 --> 26:38.262
I just need time
to figure this out.

26:38.297 --> 26:39.830
Ok.

26:39.865 --> 26:42.499
Soph, what do you
wanna do?

26:42.535 --> 26:43.767
I don't know.

26:43.803 --> 26:49.039
But I do know that we are gonna
throw Mr. Hunter off his game.

26:49.075 --> 26:50.007
And if we're lucky

26:50.042 --> 26:53.310
he'll be sorry he ever heard
of Holly Lodge.

26:58.618 --> 27:01.385
[phone ringing]

27:03.255 --> 27:06.724
[groans]

27:09.629 --> 27:10.928
Hello?

27:10.963 --> 27:13.330
<i>(Operator): Good morning, this
is your wake-up call.</i>

27:19.739 --> 27:22.406
[phone ringing]

27:22.441 --> 27:23.774
<i>Good morning-</i>

27:24.343 --> 27:28.545
[phone ringing]

27:28.581 --> 27:31.248
<i>Good morning, this is
your wake-up call.</i>

27:39.925 --> 27:41.025
Really?

27:41.060 --> 27:42.804
We haven't had a problem
with our wake-up system before.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.461
I'm so sorry.

27:44.497 --> 27:45.863
I'll have Vince check it out.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.042
Since I'm up early
I was thinking

27:47.066 --> 27:49.233
about hitting the slopes.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.601
Want a re-match?

27:50.636 --> 27:52.703
Oh, I have so much to do here.

27:52.738 --> 27:54.138
I can't.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.839
Have fun.

28:00.680 --> 28:01.445
It worked.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.247
He's a blurry-eyed mess.

28:03.282 --> 28:04.615
I see that.

28:04.650 --> 28:06.395
Wait, so what happens
if he's tired?

28:06.419 --> 28:07.551
I don't know.

28:07.586 --> 28:09.431
I mean, you know,
it slows him down.

28:09.455 --> 28:10.387
Oh.

28:10.423 --> 28:12.890
And buys me time to figure out
what to do.

28:12.925 --> 28:13.757
Yeah.

28:13.793 --> 28:14.625
Or do you just wanna see
him miserable?

28:14.660 --> 28:17.594
Because I could totally go
with that.

28:17.630 --> 28:18.630
Doesn't hurt.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.132
You're still there and
I'm not gleefully staring

28:22.168 --> 28:23.600
at signed contracts.

28:23.636 --> 28:26.470
Yes, and yes.

28:26.505 --> 28:29.239
It's just more intricate
than I thought.

28:29.275 --> 28:32.443
Look, Evan, we need action
on this now, ok?

28:32.478 --> 28:36.180
Yeah, um... I'm gonna send you
the report right now

28:36.215 --> 28:38.348
and take more site photos, ok?

28:38.384 --> 28:39.183
Good.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.652
Uh... missed a spot.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.156
[exhales]

28:46.192 --> 28:48.525
I found more Popsicle sticks,
and look at this,

28:48.561 --> 28:50.127
we have more tinsel.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.628
Hey.

28:51.664 --> 28:53.642
I know you'd rather be skiing
right now

28:53.666 --> 28:56.600
but I bought you that five-day
pass and it starts tomorrow

28:56.635 --> 28:58.480
so for today why don't
we just go back

28:58.504 --> 29:01.338
<i>to the table and
enjoy ourselves?</i>

29:02.508 --> 29:04.019
Zoe, didn't you win
the ornament contest

29:04.043 --> 29:05.609
when you were eight?

29:05.644 --> 29:08.278
Yeah.

29:08.314 --> 29:11.148
Can you look at people
when you speak to them?

29:11.183 --> 29:12.850
Yeah.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.519
Phone.

29:18.724 --> 29:25.162
As I recall, you have a way
with melancholy tweens.

29:25.197 --> 29:27.142
I don't think Zoe
wants to hear anything

29:27.166 --> 29:30.801
from a boring old lady.

29:30.836 --> 29:32.836
I know, that's why
I asked you.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.084
I'm so sorry.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.697
You have nothing
to apologize for.

29:48.721 --> 29:52.723
<i>Some days she's so proud of
what he's doing.</i>

29:52.758 --> 29:54.402
<i>I'm proud of Francisco
every day.</i>

29:54.426 --> 29:56.393
He's serving his country.

29:56.428 --> 30:00.697
But, for Zoe, he really has been
gone half her life.

30:00.733 --> 30:03.167
Why don't you stay
through New Year's, Luce?

30:03.202 --> 30:04.780
I'd love to have you here
as my guest.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.570
Your rooms aren't booked.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.539
Please?

30:08.574 --> 30:10.340
This week you got back-up.

30:10.376 --> 30:11.809
Come on.

30:22.955 --> 30:26.190
You know, that fit much better
when you were eight.

30:26.225 --> 30:27.257
Yeah.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.126
Nadine, do you have
a phone?

30:29.161 --> 30:30.294
I do.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.962
But I don't carry it.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.564
It's too nosy.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.699
Always asking can it help me,

30:35.734 --> 30:37.768
and then asking
what I just said.

30:37.803 --> 30:40.704
You know, you can turn
that voice off.

30:40.739 --> 30:43.440
Just get your phone
and I can show you.

30:43.475 --> 30:46.810
Maybe later.

30:46.846 --> 30:49.713
So you're not into the ornaments
this year, huh?

30:49.748 --> 30:51.281
Maybe it's an age thing.

30:51.317 --> 30:57.087
Oh, well, you've got to be
inspired at any age.

30:57.122 --> 30:59.223
I've always loved it.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.625
But to tell you the truth,

31:01.660 --> 31:04.628
I'm not feeling it this year,
either.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.763
Is it because...

31:06.799 --> 31:08.332
Mmmhmm.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.634
Harry would hate that.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.903
A lot.

31:12.938 --> 31:14.738
He was fun.

31:14.773 --> 31:18.976
Yes, he was.

31:19.011 --> 31:23.280
Oooh, it looks icy out there.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.514
Come on.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.483
Give me an arm, baby girl.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.552
Come on, let's go get
your coat.

31:41.967 --> 31:42.766
What?

31:42.801 --> 31:44.101
It slipped.

31:46.739 --> 31:48.238
[squeals]

31:50.409 --> 31:51.875
<i>[laughter]</i>

31:51.911 --> 31:53.644
Let's go!

31:53.679 --> 31:55.145
Oh, wait, everyone, coats!

31:55.180 --> 31:56.446
You're gonna need coats!

31:56.482 --> 31:58.115
<i>(Kyle): Snowball fight!</i>

32:01.220 --> 32:02.686

32:02.721 --> 32:05.188
<i>Oh, come on kids!</i>

32:05.224 --> 32:07.124
<i>Yeah, we got this!</i>

32:08.494 --> 32:09.960
<i>Get her!</i>

32:10.596 --> 32:15.465
[laughter]

32:15.501 --> 32:17.501
<i>Come on everybody!</i>

32:22.007 --> 32:24.508
So, this is what work
looks like today, huh?

32:29.014 --> 32:29.713
Come on, everybody!

32:29.748 --> 32:31.114
Let's get him!

32:34.720 --> 32:36.219
No prisoners!

32:45.364 --> 32:46.697
Surrender.

32:46.732 --> 32:48.532
Never.

32:48.567 --> 32:49.567
<i>Come on kids!</i>

32:49.969 --> 32:51.501
<i>Let's get them!</i>

32:51.537 --> 32:53.737
<i>Let's get them, kids, come on!</i>

32:56.542 --> 32:58.542
<i>Hey, there's a man down!</i>

32:58.978 --> 33:03.981
[humming "Deck the Halls"]

33:09.955 --> 33:12.322
[screams]

33:20.099 --> 33:21.398
<i>You sure about this?</i>

33:21.433 --> 33:24.034
Callie found it on his laptop.

33:24.069 --> 33:25.180
Ok, so you confront the guy.

33:25.204 --> 33:27.604
You don't mess with him,
you just run him out of town.

33:27.639 --> 33:30.107
And then he could just go ahead
with his take-over.

33:30.142 --> 33:31.375
I need time.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.643
Soph, all-all you gotta
say is,

33:33.679 --> 33:35.545
no, I don't wanna sell.

33:35.581 --> 33:38.815
You've been saying that to
the ski lodge for years, right?

33:38.851 --> 33:40.283
Right.

33:42.855 --> 33:45.222
What aren't you telling us?

33:46.492 --> 33:47.724
It's gonna be fine.

33:47.760 --> 33:50.627
But, you know, I had to spend
some money a couple years ago

33:50.662 --> 33:55.332
fixing this place up and then
we had some bad seasons

33:55.367 --> 33:57.501
and I got behind
on the mortgage.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.835
Why didn't you tell me?

33:58.871 --> 33:59.770
Because I didn't wanna
worry you,

33:59.805 --> 34:01.149
and there's nothing
you can do about it

34:01.173 --> 34:02.606
and it's my responsibility.

34:02.641 --> 34:04.107
But I figured everything out.

34:04.143 --> 34:05.509
I had it all budgeted,

34:05.544 --> 34:07.422
so we were gonna be
caught up by summer.

34:07.446 --> 34:10.112
How behind are you?

34:10.149 --> 34:12.581
Six months.

34:12.618 --> 34:16.353
So if Evan knew you were
behind on your payments,

34:16.388 --> 34:18.433
he could get bank of Frank
to sell your note.

34:18.456 --> 34:19.422
Exactly.

34:19.458 --> 34:22.025
And I couldn't stop him.

34:22.061 --> 34:24.828
But this is a private business

34:24.862 --> 34:26.775
so Frank shouldn't be
telling him that, right?

34:26.799 --> 34:27.964
If he's being professional?

34:28.000 --> 34:29.666
So we're fine.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.335
I don't wanna talk about it
anymore 'cause it's Christmas

34:32.371 --> 34:35.105
and nothing is gonna ruin
this holiday, ok?

34:35.139 --> 34:37.440
Everything is gonna
be perfect.

34:37.476 --> 34:40.476
[loudly chopping]

35:01.233 --> 35:03.633
[exhales]

35:03.669 --> 35:05.335
Perfect.

[banging]

[yawning]

35:35.033 --> 35:36.533
Hi.

35:36.568 --> 35:40.504
You didn't have to come down
here and keep me company.

35:40.539 --> 35:42.172
I'm not.

35:42.207 --> 35:44.574
Evan's pipes are
right next to mine.

35:44.610 --> 35:47.577
Hand over the wrench and
step away from the vehicle.

35:47.613 --> 35:49.112
This isn't working.

35:49.148 --> 35:51.047
I know, I'm just desperate, ok?

35:51.083 --> 35:52.694
I haven't figured out
what to do yet.

35:52.718 --> 35:57.254
I promise you, we will think
of something.

35:57.289 --> 35:59.623
Ok, please go to bed.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.892
For all of our sakes.

36:01.927 --> 36:02.927
[exhales]

36:13.805 --> 36:15.605
Hey, Zoe.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.440
You ok?

36:17.476 --> 36:19.776
It's 3:30 in the morning.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.912
It's 3:00 in the afternoon
somewhere.

36:21.947 --> 36:23.914
Yeah?

36:23.949 --> 36:27.317
It's an 11 and a half hour
difference in Afghanistan.

36:27.352 --> 36:28.985
Why the half hour?

36:29.021 --> 36:30.253
What's that about?

36:30.289 --> 36:33.390
I don't know.

36:33.425 --> 36:36.560
But your dad's coming home
soon, ok?

36:36.595 --> 36:41.264
And then you can bring him here,
introduce him to all of us.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.521
You know, we can fix that
with some glue.

36:53.545 --> 36:57.480
Some uh, glitter glue.

36:57.516 --> 37:01.351
But monster trucks
don't have glitter.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.820
That's true, but um,
this one's been under cover

37:03.855 --> 37:05.422
in the North Pole.

37:05.457 --> 37:06.756
So it can fly?

37:06.792 --> 37:09.159
Well, it's back-up for Santa,
right?

37:09.194 --> 37:12.796
In case it breaks down
or a reindeer gets cold.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.532
And yes, absolutely it can fly.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.801
Now, let's um, let's see
what we can do for a-

37:17.836 --> 37:19.836
a jet engine.

37:22.307 --> 37:23.607
(whispers) Give me a second.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.275
Hey.

37:25.310 --> 37:26.142
Hey.

37:26.178 --> 37:28.478
I'm just on my way out
to go shopping.

37:28.513 --> 37:29.346
Do you want company?

37:29.381 --> 37:31.681
Callie's coming with me,
but thank you.

37:31.717 --> 37:32.949
Ok.

37:32.985 --> 37:35.652
You have a jet engine
you're building.

37:41.226 --> 37:44.361
Well, thank you so much
for your time, ok.

37:44.396 --> 37:46.162
Merry Christmas.

37:47.065 --> 37:47.731
So?

37:47.766 --> 37:48.810
How did it go with the lawyer?

37:48.834 --> 37:49.899
Ugh.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.512
I thought I might know some
investors but no luck.

37:51.536 --> 37:54.037
I just wish I knew if Evan knew
about the debt.

37:54.072 --> 37:55.338
We need more information.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.484
Maybe you're playing it wrong.

37:56.508 --> 37:59.542
Maybe instead of avoiding him
you should get closer.

37:59.578 --> 38:00.510
Like the saying.

38:00.545 --> 38:02.657
You mean like friends close,
enemies closer?

38:02.681 --> 38:04.180
Mmmhmm.

38:04.216 --> 38:05.893
I can't believe I'm calling
Evan an enemy.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.595
Did you see him with Kyle
this morning?

38:07.619 --> 38:09.519
Yeah.

38:09.554 --> 38:12.522
I can't believe he's trying
to take my lodge from me.

38:15.794 --> 38:16.526
Art, you here?

38:16.561 --> 38:18.828
All day, every day,
my friend.

38:18.864 --> 38:19.496
Oh, hey.

38:19.531 --> 38:20.531
Hey.

38:22.301 --> 38:24.334
I need a one-horse
open sleigh.

38:24.369 --> 38:26.547
Sure. Yeah, you might
also find some turtle doves

38:26.571 --> 38:27.682
down at the Jasper farm.

38:27.706 --> 38:28.905
Uh-huh.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.151
They could probably help you
out with six gees a-layin', too.

38:30.175 --> 38:31.786
Oh, and for a non-livestock
options there's five gold rings

38:31.810 --> 38:33.243
at Clifton's which are great.

38:33.278 --> 38:37.681
Nice, but I-I just need
the one-horse open sleigh.

38:37.716 --> 38:38.548
Today.

38:38.583 --> 38:39.449
Oh.

38:39.484 --> 38:40.417
Yeah.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.619
Ok, so not just any
grand holiday gesture.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.287
This is specific.

38:44.323 --> 38:45.388
Very.

38:45.424 --> 38:46.956
Is there a woman involved?

38:46.992 --> 38:47.891
Yeah.

38:47.926 --> 38:48.591
Oh boy.

38:48.627 --> 38:49.259
Yeah.

38:49.294 --> 38:50.760
Ok. Let me make some calls.

38:50.796 --> 38:51.628
Great.

38:52.431 --> 38:53.229
Yeah?

38:53.265 --> 38:54.230
I feel, like, excited
about this.

38:54.266 --> 38:55.098

39:10.949 --> 39:11.781
Is it that voice?

39:11.817 --> 39:13.917
Or the fact that there's
a voice at all?

39:13.952 --> 39:15.596
You mean I can have
a different voice?

39:15.620 --> 39:16.653
There's options.

39:51.123 --> 39:54.257
Just when I thought
I liked you.

39:54.292 --> 39:56.192
No, they're vintage.

39:56.228 --> 39:58.762
I'm into a retro phase.

39:58.797 --> 40:01.131
Well, they're nice.

40:04.669 --> 40:06.280
You think that Evan's
gonna wanna come

40:06.304 --> 40:07.804
to the tree-lighting tonight?

40:07.839 --> 40:09.973
Oh, well, we should
probably count on it.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.175
I can always push dinner
back an hour.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.143
Vince can help us.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.444
He'll be here.

40:14.479 --> 40:16.646
'Cause he's such
a great guy?

40:16.681 --> 40:17.614
I know.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.682
Don't start.

40:19.718 --> 40:21.117
It's obvious.

40:21.153 --> 40:22.296
You should give him
a chance.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.353
Come on, Callie.

40:23.388 --> 40:26.389
You two could be the Christmas
miracle this year.

40:26.425 --> 40:27.657
[sleigh bells]

40:27.692 --> 40:28.892
Ok, how did you do that?

40:28.927 --> 40:31.305
'Cause I said your name and
Vince's and "Christmas miracle"

40:31.329 --> 40:32.395
in the same sentence.

40:32.431 --> 40:34.197
[laughs]

40:34.232 --> 40:35.331
You should re-think.

40:35.367 --> 40:36.499
I am.

40:36.535 --> 40:39.135
I'm re-thinking this whole
miracle business right now.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.306
Hmm.

40:45.744 --> 40:49.746
Wha-What have you done?

40:49.781 --> 40:51.759
You said you'd love a one-horse
open sleigh.

40:51.783 --> 40:52.549
Come on.

40:52.584 --> 40:53.550
[laughs]

40:53.585 --> 40:56.586
Uh... uh, I can-I can't.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.321
Uh, I have to...

40:58.356 --> 41:00.723
Friends close,
enemies closer.

41:02.260 --> 41:03.393
<i>Ok.</i>

41:03.428 --> 41:06.496
But, you know,
just to gather Intel.

41:06.531 --> 41:07.931
Oh, yeah. Of course.

41:07.966 --> 41:08.966
Ok.

41:26.318 --> 41:27.083
Ho.

41:27.118 --> 41:27.684
Ho.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.919
Ho, ho, ho.

41:30.789 --> 41:32.722
[laughs]

41:32.757 --> 41:34.924
Ok, let's go now.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.426
Let's go.

41:36.461 --> 41:38.094
Giddy-up.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.562
Giddy-up.

41:39.598 --> 41:42.232
[whistling]

41:42.267 --> 41:44.567
I- I don't think
that's how it works.

41:44.603 --> 41:45.768
Oh.

41:45.804 --> 41:46.603
Oh.

41:46.638 --> 41:48.037
Giddy-up.

41:48.073 --> 41:48.771
Giddy-up.

41:48.807 --> 41:50.073
Giddy-up-up-up.

41:50.108 --> 41:51.207
hup, hup, hup...

41:51.243 --> 41:54.544
Are you whispering to him?

41:56.147 --> 42:00.416
[laughs]

42:00.452 --> 42:02.719
Ok, painful confession.

42:02.754 --> 42:04.621
I have no idea
what I'm doing.

42:04.656 --> 42:05.755
Would you mind?

42:05.790 --> 42:07.323
No, please.

42:07.359 --> 42:09.425
Please.

42:09.461 --> 42:11.327
A-ha.

42:11.363 --> 42:13.363
That's how you do it.

42:15.467 --> 42:16.507
I'm still impressed.

42:16.535 --> 42:17.834
How did you do it?

42:17.869 --> 42:19.614
There's no one-horse sleigh
in this town.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.571
I know. I know.

42:21.606 --> 42:23.317
Art from the feed
and tack store,

42:23.341 --> 42:24.619
he found one two
counties over.

42:24.643 --> 42:26.509
It's through here.

42:26.545 --> 42:27.877
Oh.

42:33.218 --> 42:34.017
Here it is.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.818
Woah.

42:36.821 --> 42:38.454
Look at that.

42:40.692 --> 42:42.425
This is my place.

42:42.460 --> 42:43.826
Did you know that?

42:43.862 --> 42:45.328
Your place?

42:45.363 --> 42:47.697
Yeah, since I was a kid.

42:47.732 --> 42:48.698
I had no idea.

42:48.733 --> 42:50.845
I just walked around and
tried to look for a spot

42:50.869 --> 42:53.469
that I thought you'd love.

42:55.807 --> 42:57.941
I've spent thousands of hours
up here

42:57.976 --> 43:01.177
just watching the mountain
breathe.

43:06.384 --> 43:07.183
What?

43:07.218 --> 43:09.018
It all has a story.

43:09.054 --> 43:09.986
Your story.

43:10.021 --> 43:12.155
But everyone's life is like
that, isn't it?

43:12.190 --> 43:13.489
Not like yours.

43:13.525 --> 43:20.563
Most of us just...
observe, collect, visit.

43:20.599 --> 43:24.167
I guess I try to leave a place
better than I found it.

43:24.202 --> 43:25.635
And do you?

43:25.670 --> 43:27.637
I don't know.

43:27.672 --> 43:30.306
Maybe that's just
what I tell myself.

43:33.545 --> 43:36.713
Where's home for you?

43:36.748 --> 43:38.982
Well, I'm based in New York

43:39.017 --> 43:43.086
because it's a little bit of
everywhere and that fits me.

43:43.121 --> 43:46.022
But really, that could change
any time.

43:46.057 --> 43:50.059
So I-I guess no home.

43:50.095 --> 43:53.696
I always felt it was the journey
that mattered, you know?

43:53.732 --> 43:57.834
It is.

43:57.869 --> 43:59.947
But sometimes you find
everything you're looking for

43:59.971 --> 44:01.904
in one place.

44:05.110 --> 44:07.410
Or one person.

44:13.318 --> 44:15.184
I should probably get back.

44:15.220 --> 44:17.387
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, me too.

44:17.422 --> 44:20.056
Here.

44:26.097 --> 44:28.631
You really think this is,
what, all an act?

44:28.667 --> 44:29.465
It has to be.

44:29.501 --> 44:31.567
I think Evan is just
after my assets.

44:31.603 --> 44:34.470
He could be doing his job
and be into you.

44:34.506 --> 44:36.539
That would be even worse.

44:36.574 --> 44:38.408
But it's not a problem, right?

44:38.443 --> 44:39.809
'Cause you're on to him?

44:39.844 --> 44:41.944
Can you just please agree
to help me here?

44:41.980 --> 44:43.813
I- I want you to stall, alright?

44:43.848 --> 44:45.826
Distract him for, like,
an hour after the tree lighting,

44:45.850 --> 44:47.316
keep him away from the lodge.

44:47.352 --> 44:48.184
I'm gonna check his computer.

44:48.219 --> 44:49.964
See what he knows
about my finances.

44:49.988 --> 44:52.789
Aaah.

44:52.824 --> 44:54.590
Ok.

44:54.626 --> 44:55.291
Thank you.

44:55.326 --> 44:56.159
You owe me.

44:56.194 --> 44:58.261
I know, forever.

45:08.106 --> 45:09.572
Hey, how's everybody doing?

45:09.607 --> 45:11.552
Who's ready to have
an amazing Christmas?

45:11.576 --> 45:12.975
[cheering]

45:13.011 --> 45:15.011
Yeah!

45:15.947 --> 45:17.080
Wait, you and Art bonded?

45:17.115 --> 45:18.314
Oh, yeah.

45:18.349 --> 45:20.261
Yeah, he's the guy you have
to talk to in this town, right?

45:20.285 --> 45:21.451
Yeah.

45:21.486 --> 45:22.652
How did you figure-

45:22.687 --> 45:23.653
<i>Alright, I wanna thank you
all for coming out</i>

45:23.688 --> 45:24.699
<i>and decorating
this tree tonight.</i>

45:24.723 --> 45:26.923
And a special thinks
to Clifton's for donating

45:26.958 --> 45:28.969
these amazing ornaments
again this year.

45:28.993 --> 45:31.994
[cheering]

45:32.030 --> 45:33.396
And now I wanna bring up

45:33.431 --> 45:35.765
the best mayor in town,
Mayor Fletcher!

45:35.800 --> 45:37.166
Judy, come on up.

45:37.202 --> 45:38.768
[cheering]

45:38.803 --> 45:40.603
<i>Thanks, Art.</i>

45:40.638 --> 45:44.440
And thanks to all of you for
coming out on this brisk evening

45:44.476 --> 45:45.608
to help us...

45:45.643 --> 45:46.542
Ah, yeah.

45:46.578 --> 45:52.648
This whole trip has been...
unexpected.

45:52.684 --> 45:53.816
Yeah, it has.

45:53.852 --> 45:57.186
<i>Alright, are you ready?
Let's count it down.</i>

45:57.222 --> 46:02.725
(All): Five, four, three,
two, one.

46:03.628 --> 46:08.131
[cheering and applause]

46:13.571 --> 46:15.972
You know, I go to a lot
of little towns

46:16.007 --> 46:18.941
all around the world
and I love it,

46:18.977 --> 46:25.148
but I've never felt this...
compelled.

46:25.183 --> 46:26.816
Compelled?

46:26.851 --> 46:27.750
Yeah.

46:27.786 --> 46:32.321
Yeah, I... I feel like
I could stay here.

46:34.359 --> 46:35.491
Hey.

46:35.527 --> 46:36.359
Hey.

46:36.394 --> 46:38.005
So, uh, your in for that beer,
or what?

46:38.029 --> 46:39.395
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

46:39.430 --> 46:39.996
Let's do that.

46:40.031 --> 46:40.563
Alright.

46:40.598 --> 46:41.397
Uh, you gonna come with?

46:41.432 --> 46:42.532
Oh, I can't.

46:42.567 --> 46:44.167
I have, um, stuff.

46:44.202 --> 46:44.867
Alright.

46:44.903 --> 46:45.635
Yeah.

46:45.670 --> 46:46.235
See you later?

46:46.271 --> 46:47.303
Yeah.

46:47.338 --> 46:48.805
After you.

46:53.945 --> 46:54.710
What was that?

46:54.746 --> 46:56.646
Oh, I know.

46:56.681 --> 46:58.848
He's so great.

47:02.720 --> 47:05.054
So Vince is gonna
keep him occupied

47:05.089 --> 47:07.001
so that I can figure out
what he knows

47:07.025 --> 47:08.357
about my mortgage.

47:08.393 --> 47:09.559
Ok.

47:09.594 --> 47:13.496
I'll keep everyone here as long
as I can so you can snoop.

47:15.366 --> 47:16.165
Investigate.

47:16.201 --> 47:17.700
Yeah. Totally.

47:17.735 --> 47:19.602
Yeah.

47:19.637 --> 47:21.470
Thank you.

47:23.541 --> 47:27.543
Yeah, I like the Rockies in the
winter and Australia in summer.

47:27.579 --> 47:28.377
But then a few years ago

47:28.413 --> 47:31.514
I decided to move back
to Overton.

47:31.549 --> 47:33.427
I'm sensing there's
a woman in this story.

47:33.451 --> 47:35.618
Yeah, well, maybe.

47:35.653 --> 47:38.120
All I knew is I'd never find
someone serious

47:38.156 --> 47:41.357
if I kept running
all over chasing snow.

47:41.392 --> 47:44.093
Hmm.

47:44.128 --> 47:45.228
What?

47:45.263 --> 47:48.364
Nah, I'm just trying to imagine
what it's like staying

47:48.399 --> 47:51.367
in one place all the time.

47:51.402 --> 47:54.136
Well, it's not-I mean,
it's not all the time,

47:54.172 --> 47:55.916
it's just I have somewhere
to call home.

47:55.940 --> 47:57.473
What about you?

47:57.508 --> 47:59.709
Oh, I love the road.

47:59.744 --> 48:00.910
Yeah.

48:00.945 --> 48:03.179
Yeah, I get that.

48:39.017 --> 48:42.084
How long have you known
Sophie?

48:42.120 --> 48:45.288
Uh, all my life, I guess.

48:45.323 --> 48:48.925
I spent more time at the lodge
than I ever did at my house.

48:48.960 --> 48:52.762
Sophie's parents were, uh,
they were really good to me.

48:52.797 --> 48:54.263
Her dad especially.

48:54.299 --> 48:56.010
He's the one who showed me
how to use tools,

48:56.034 --> 48:56.966
how to ski...

48:57.001 --> 48:57.800
Sounds like a great guy.

48:57.835 --> 48:58.901
Yeah, yeah. He was.

48:58.937 --> 49:04.040
The lodge has always been a,
uh... a generous place.

49:04.075 --> 49:05.975
Sophie's kept it that way.

49:06.010 --> 49:07.621
The people that come here
every Christmas,

49:07.645 --> 49:11.681
they... well, they need it.

49:11.716 --> 49:13.282
I can see that.

49:13.318 --> 49:16.686
You can.

49:16.721 --> 49:18.487
That's good.

49:18.523 --> 49:20.556
Yeah.

49:20.591 --> 49:23.159
You really look out for Sophie,
don't you?

49:23.194 --> 49:25.127
Yeah, you better believe it.

49:27.765 --> 49:30.499
Hey, let me get this.

49:30.535 --> 49:31.167
You sure?

49:31.202 --> 49:32.902
Yeah.

49:32.937 --> 49:34.136
Thanks, man.

49:34.172 --> 49:35.504
See you around.

49:35.540 --> 49:37.440
Yeah, you have a good night.

49:41.179 --> 49:44.680
He knows everything.

49:44.716 --> 49:47.516
How did he find out?

49:48.853 --> 49:52.655
[low chatter]

50:00.965 --> 50:02.398
Evan!

50:02.433 --> 50:04.500
Uh... Evan.

50:04.535 --> 50:06.068
Uh, we are doing Secret Santa.

50:06.104 --> 50:07.937
Did you wanna join us?

50:07.972 --> 50:10.039
Yeah, sure.

50:10.074 --> 50:11.218
Uh, I'll just be right back.

50:11.242 --> 50:12.842
Yeah, don't-

50:19.751 --> 50:21.417
[message alert]

50:46.077 --> 50:47.743
[sighs]

50:48.346 --> 50:51.614
[phone rings to British tune]

50:51.649 --> 50:53.616
<i>Sir lain, happy Christmas.</i>

50:53.651 --> 50:54.917
What time is it there?

50:54.952 --> 50:56.118
<i>Oh, who can sleep?</i>

50:56.154 --> 50:56.886
It's a mountain.

50:56.921 --> 50:57.620
A mountain, Evan!

50:57.655 --> 50:59.155
A bloody mountain!

50:59.190 --> 51:01.490
Yeah, but you don't have
the full picture yet.

51:01.526 --> 51:03.570
<i>How full does the picture
have to get, man?</i>

51:03.594 --> 51:05.472
It's a little lodge
with a big mountain.

51:05.496 --> 51:09.465
<i>The lodge is a... a family-run
business.</i>

51:09.500 --> 51:11.078
<i>You know how messy
that can be, right?</i>

51:11.102 --> 51:12.268
<i>Evan, hello?</i>

51:12.303 --> 51:13.580
[breaking up]
Iain?

51:13.604 --> 51:14.570
Iain, I-

51:14.605 --> 51:16.072
Evan, hello? Hello?

51:16.107 --> 51:17.440
I'm losing you.

51:22.146 --> 51:23.312
Hello? Are you there?

51:24.148 --> 51:26.615
Iain, you need to read
my whole report.

51:26.651 --> 51:28.662
There's an ordinance
against any new construction

51:28.686 --> 51:29.885
on the mountain,

51:29.921 --> 51:32.321
so whatever you were planning
to do you probably couldn't.

51:32.356 --> 51:34.356
It's a challenge.

51:34.392 --> 51:35.191
Come on, Evan.

51:35.226 --> 51:36.459
<i>We can do this.</i>

51:36.494 --> 51:39.495
<i>Now, find the banker,
get the ball rolling, ok?</i>

51:41.299 --> 51:43.399
<i>Hello, Evan? Hello?</i>

51:44.235 --> 51:46.302
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

51:46.337 --> 51:48.204
<i>I'll... I'll do my best.</i>

51:48.239 --> 51:50.473
<i>Good man.
Merry Christmas.</i>

51:50.508 --> 51:51.974
Bye.

52:01.219 --> 52:02.785
<i>[footsteps above]</i>

52:08.893 --> 52:10.359
Santa?

52:13.331 --> 52:13.829
It's Santa!

52:13.865 --> 52:15.431
Santa's on the roof!

52:22.840 --> 52:23.506
It's Santa!

52:23.541 --> 52:25.174
Santa's on the roof right now!

52:25.209 --> 52:25.908
Sorry, kid.

52:25.943 --> 52:26.809
Wrong night.

52:26.844 --> 52:27.576
Where is he, Kyle?

52:27.612 --> 52:29.311
Kyle, do up your coat.

52:30.047 --> 52:31.680
Over here.

52:34.051 --> 52:35.551
Oh, uh...

52:35.586 --> 52:36.752
Sophie.

52:36.787 --> 52:38.554
What're you doing up there?

52:38.589 --> 52:41.056
Oh, hey, everybody.

52:41.092 --> 52:42.791
What's going on?

52:43.528 --> 52:44.528
Hi.

52:46.697 --> 52:48.097
What're you doing?

52:48.132 --> 52:49.165
Uh...

52:50.468 --> 52:51.700
Repairs.

52:51.736 --> 52:52.935
Right. Repairs.

52:52.970 --> 52:53.769
Yes.

52:53.804 --> 52:56.338
The lights went out,
um, yesterday,

52:56.374 --> 52:57.773
and so I wanted to fix them.

52:57.808 --> 52:59.341
That couldn't wait?

52:59.377 --> 53:00.242
Look at you.

53:00.278 --> 53:02.378
Oh, I've been up here loads
of times.

53:02.413 --> 53:03.679
You know, it's not a problem.

53:03.714 --> 53:04.880
You need any help?

53:04.916 --> 53:05.881
No, no.

53:05.917 --> 53:06.849
Uh, thank you.

53:06.884 --> 53:08.083
Actually, I fixed it.

53:08.119 --> 53:09.852
Then why aren't the lights on?

53:25.970 --> 53:26.535
<i>There you go!</i>

53:26.571 --> 53:27.937
<i>Wow!</i>

53:27.972 --> 53:29.672
<i>It works.</i>

53:32.143 --> 53:35.878
Ok, let's go on in
before we freeze.

53:35.913 --> 53:37.213
Hot chocolate's almost ready.

53:37.248 --> 53:39.215
Come on, let's go,
let's go.

53:39.250 --> 53:40.716
Let's go.

53:47.525 --> 53:49.525
Just head on in,
we'll be right there.

53:53.598 --> 53:54.496
Wow.

53:54.532 --> 53:55.331
That was close.

53:55.366 --> 53:56.799
Super close.

53:56.834 --> 53:59.235
We can call that the Christmas
miracle this year.

53:59.270 --> 54:03.906
I think I'm holding out for
something a little... better.

54:06.143 --> 54:08.410
Oh, uh... thank you.

54:08.446 --> 54:11.247
I can't believe you were up
there working in just a vest.

54:11.282 --> 54:14.316
I- I didn't expect to be
up there so long.

54:14.352 --> 54:15.884
Come on, let's get you inside.

54:26.197 --> 54:27.296
Ok...

54:27.865 --> 54:28.797
Hey.

54:28.833 --> 54:30.544
I uh, wanted to talk to you
about something.

54:30.568 --> 54:32.234
Yeah.

54:32.270 --> 54:33.202
Uh, hold that thought.

54:33.237 --> 54:34.970
Don't do anything.

54:35.006 --> 54:36.883
Uh, we'll be back
in a little bit.

54:36.907 --> 54:37.673
Sure.

54:37.708 --> 54:39.708
I'm gonna find Rudolph
this year.

54:39.744 --> 54:42.911
Yeah, reindeer tracking
is serious business.

54:42.947 --> 54:43.879
Come on, everyone,
let's go.

54:43.914 --> 54:46.315
Why don't you go ski
or something for a bit?

54:46.350 --> 54:48.717
Uh... see you later?

54:53.858 --> 54:56.358
What animals do we
want to find today?

54:56.394 --> 54:58.494
Abominable snowman!

54:58.529 --> 54:59.561
[laughs]

54:59.597 --> 55:02.031
Ok, besides reindeer
and yeti,

55:02.066 --> 55:05.434
do we think that all animals
hibernate in the winter?

55:05.469 --> 55:06.435
[children]
No.

55:06.470 --> 55:07.836
<i>No. Of course not.</i>

55:07.872 --> 55:09.838
<i>You guys are too smart
for me.</i>

55:10.474 --> 55:12.452
<i>What else do you think we're
going to find?</i>

55:12.476 --> 55:15.678
Yeah, this is Evan Hunter
for Frank Dunlop.

55:15.713 --> 55:17.513
He's expecting my call.

55:48.946 --> 55:50.379
Woah.

55:50.414 --> 55:51.914
Nadine, are you sure?

55:51.949 --> 55:53.982
Do you wanna make something
that pops?

55:54.018 --> 55:55.484
Well, yeah, but-

55:55.519 --> 55:57.119
No "well, yeah, but".

55:57.154 --> 55:59.621
I am inspired
and you need a win.

55:59.657 --> 56:02.157
Time to put this collection
to good use.

56:02.193 --> 56:04.293
So hop to it, baby girl.

56:04.328 --> 56:07.096
Last night at the pub the bank
of Frank was looking for Evan

56:07.131 --> 56:08.842
and he saw me
and he ducked.

56:08.866 --> 56:10.477
Today I saw him in
the square with Evan,

56:10.501 --> 56:11.967
they were shaking hands.

56:12.002 --> 56:13.447
Well, let's not jump
to conclusions.

56:13.471 --> 56:14.981
Evan knows about
the mortgage.

56:15.005 --> 56:16.483
He knows about
the late payments.

56:16.507 --> 56:19.641
He said that we were
a distressed asset,

56:19.677 --> 56:22.144
an easy acquisition.

56:22.179 --> 56:23.824
He tried to talk to me
about it.

56:23.848 --> 56:25.959
I managed to put him off
and I'll just keep doing that.

56:25.983 --> 56:27.449
How can we help?

56:27.485 --> 56:29.529
I've got some equity
in my parent's old house.

56:29.553 --> 56:30.185
Let me-

56:30.221 --> 56:30.886
Vince.

56:30.921 --> 56:32.654
I'm not taking your inheritance.

56:32.690 --> 56:34.990
It's gonna be ok.

56:35.025 --> 56:36.303
But you know
what you could do?

56:36.327 --> 56:38.927
You could start enjoying
Christmas.

56:38.963 --> 56:43.165
And you both could do me
a favour and stop wasting time.

56:47.505 --> 56:49.204
Huh.

56:49.240 --> 56:50.205
Well, that was...

56:50.241 --> 56:51.473
Super subtle.

56:51.509 --> 56:52.474
Yeah.

56:52.510 --> 56:53.609
Yeah.

56:53.644 --> 56:56.645
Loretta, set Mr. Hunter up
with everything he needs.

56:56.680 --> 56:58.013
Thanks, Frank.

56:59.417 --> 57:01.016
Here you go.

57:01.819 --> 57:03.318
Let's see here.

57:07.858 --> 57:09.024
This is it? Really?

57:09.059 --> 57:11.693
That's the current loan
on Holly Lodge.

57:13.831 --> 57:17.065
Loretta, my boss wants me
to be very, very thorough

57:17.101 --> 57:20.302
and I'm gonna need to see
all the agreements,

57:20.337 --> 57:23.806
every single lien on Holly Lodge
in its history.

57:23.841 --> 57:26.642
Yeah, I-I know Frank wants
to make things easy for me

57:26.677 --> 57:27.976
but I can handle the paper.

57:28.012 --> 57:29.478
I promise.

57:29.513 --> 57:30.779
Hmm?

57:32.016 --> 57:33.615
One moment.

57:36.420 --> 57:38.398
I understand, but isn't there
a way you can get

57:38.422 --> 57:40.255
a message to him?

57:40.291 --> 57:42.491
I know you have satellites
everywhere.

57:42.526 --> 57:43.526
Please.

57:43.561 --> 57:45.060
I'm sorry, Mrs. Montoya.

57:45.095 --> 57:46.840
Our communication links
are down and we don't know

57:46.864 --> 57:48.697
when they'll be back up.

57:48.732 --> 57:50.499
It's the weather.

57:55.739 --> 57:56.505
Hey.

57:56.540 --> 57:58.474
Mr. Jingle Bells.

57:59.810 --> 58:01.188
So did the sleigh
do the trick?

58:01.212 --> 58:02.344
You know, I thought so.

58:02.379 --> 58:05.214
Now... I'm not so sure.

58:05.249 --> 58:06.293
So what're you doing
holed up here

58:06.317 --> 58:08.595
with this pile of papers
instead of being with her?

58:08.619 --> 58:10.430
I'm looking for the needle
in the haystack

58:10.454 --> 58:13.055
that's gonna save her
from her worst nightmare.

58:13.090 --> 58:14.456
Which is...?

58:14.492 --> 58:15.924
Me.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.860
Or... not me.

58:17.895 --> 58:19.962
My old self.

58:19.997 --> 58:21.141
So what, you're not
yourself anymore?

58:21.165 --> 58:22.231
I don't... what?

58:22.266 --> 58:23.298
I don't know.

58:23.334 --> 58:27.069
Maybe I'm completely myself
for the first time.

58:27.104 --> 58:28.315
Ok, I'm just gonna stop
you right there

58:28.339 --> 58:29.538
'cause this conversation is

58:29.573 --> 58:30.906
[makes exploding sound]

58:30.941 --> 58:32.452
But I will leave you
with this, though.

58:32.476 --> 58:33.987
You know who first looked
for needles in haystacks?

58:34.011 --> 58:34.776
No, who?

58:34.812 --> 58:36.311
Don Quixote.

58:36.347 --> 58:37.980
You would kill at pub trivia.

58:38.015 --> 58:39.826
Oh yeah. Tri-city champ
three years in a row.

58:39.850 --> 58:40.749
Bit of a curse, though.

58:40.784 --> 58:41.583
Uh-huh.

58:41.619 --> 58:42.918
The old noodle.

58:42.953 --> 58:43.719
Don Quixote.

58:43.754 --> 58:45.420
Uh-huh.

58:45.456 --> 58:46.255
Didn't end well.

58:46.290 --> 58:48.056
No, it didn't.

58:48.092 --> 58:49.436
So you have to re-write
that story.

58:49.460 --> 58:51.193
Good luck.

59:00.704 --> 59:01.803
Hey, Nadine.

59:01.839 --> 59:04.406
I came up with the choreography
for our Christmas number

59:04.441 --> 59:06.686
but it's hard to get the little
kids to do the moves.

59:06.710 --> 59:08.810
It's Jingle Bells, right?

59:08.846 --> 59:10.290
Well, you're lucky
it's not funk.

59:10.314 --> 59:13.582
Some kids never learn how
to drop it on the one.

59:13.617 --> 59:15.295
I don't know what any part
of that means.

59:15.319 --> 59:15.851
Really?

59:15.886 --> 59:17.920
Seriously. Not one word.

59:17.955 --> 59:20.722
Oh, you got a lot to learn, kid.

59:22.159 --> 59:23.091
<i>We'll figure something out.</i>

59:23.127 --> 59:24.393
Ok, you're right.

59:25.462 --> 59:29.631
Hey, what're you kids
talking about

59:29.667 --> 59:32.935
You tried again,
didn't you.

59:32.970 --> 59:34.781
Yeah, they said they'd get
the message to him

59:34.805 --> 59:36.772
when they can get through.

59:40.878 --> 59:43.645
Don't worry, mom,
he'll be alright.

59:47.351 --> 59:48.016
It's ok.

59:48.052 --> 59:49.618
Come on.

01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:04.333
We missed you at
the tree lighting.

01:00:04.368 --> 01:00:06.001
Oh, I had to rest.

01:00:06.036 --> 01:00:09.338
I just couldn't...

01:00:09.373 --> 01:00:11.239
No one's heard you sing.

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:14.810
I'm waiting for the spirit
to hit me.

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:17.045
You do what you need.

01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:19.214
You sure are good with Zoe.

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:22.818
Oh, I understand
heartsick kids.

01:00:22.853 --> 01:00:25.053
You bear that in mind.

01:00:25.089 --> 01:00:27.022
I'm fine.

01:00:27.057 --> 01:00:31.326
I mean, I will be... fine.

01:00:31.362 --> 01:00:33.328
What's wrong with you?

01:00:33.364 --> 01:00:35.530
You get to fall in love.

01:00:35.566 --> 01:00:38.533
Not this time.

01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:41.236
What is it?

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:43.739
I just have things I have to do.

01:00:43.774 --> 01:00:49.277
And Evan is not who or what
I thought and...

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:52.347
I just need to stay away
from him.

01:00:52.383 --> 01:00:55.250
You know, I have to keep
my wits about me.

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:58.453
Wits are highly overrated.

01:00:58.489 --> 01:01:00.622
You know what Harry
used to say?

01:01:00.658 --> 01:01:04.726
He said that I would lose
anything that was not Velcro-ed

01:01:04.762 --> 01:01:09.231
onto me or written
on my hand.

01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:11.533
Ok, he was right.

01:01:11.568 --> 01:01:13.380
But you know what
I will never lose?

01:01:13.404 --> 01:01:15.103
Ever?

01:01:15.139 --> 01:01:18.573
How I feel.

01:01:18.609 --> 01:01:21.543
I remember every day
we spent together.

01:01:21.578 --> 01:01:24.579
The good and the bad.

01:01:24.615 --> 01:01:27.949
And that counts for something.

01:01:27.985 --> 01:01:30.552
I saw the way you looked
at Evan.

01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:34.389
Even more, I saw the way
he looked at you.

01:01:34.425 --> 01:01:35.824
I felt it, too.

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:40.395
From across the room.

01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:43.498
Well, that's why
this stinks so much.

01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:45.934
Honey, it is not over.

01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:47.814
I know this has been a bad day
for all of us,

01:01:47.838 --> 01:01:49.838
just kicking us in our behind.

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:52.474
Bad day, two, Christmas, zero.

01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:55.243
So I say we move on.

01:01:55.279 --> 01:01:58.346
Or eat cookie dough.

01:01:58.382 --> 01:01:59.514
Why not both?

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:01.850
Oh, that's my girl!

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:02.818
[laughs]

01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:04.119
Come on.

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:16.832
[door closes]

01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:19.468
Hey.

01:02:19.503 --> 01:02:20.836
Hey.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:24.039
You must be part polar bear.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:24.873
What?

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:27.509
Oh, no, I'm just used
to the cold

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:30.479
and I like how crisp
the air is.

01:02:30.514 --> 01:02:31.624
So what did I miss tonight?

01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:34.182
Well, the kids are busy
practicing their musical number

01:02:34.218 --> 01:02:35.283
for Christmas Eve.

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:36.518
Mmm.

01:02:36.553 --> 01:02:41.490
And, uh, Nadine is showing Zoe
my old family photo albums.

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:42.691
What've you been up to?

01:02:42.726 --> 01:02:48.463
Well, the better question
is "Evan, what's in the box?"

01:02:48.499 --> 01:02:52.200
Oh, uh, if this is your Secret
Santa you're supposed to wait.

01:02:52.236 --> 01:02:53.535
Just... it isn't.

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:54.970
Open it.

01:02:58.408 --> 01:02:59.374
Go ahead.

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:00.175
[laughs]

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:01.476
Ok.

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:06.014
Oh, what is this?

01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:10.886
Ok, so that one,
is from Peru.

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:17.425
And, uh, this one I got at
the casbah in Marrakech.

01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:20.195
I watched the guy cut
and stamp it right there.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.896
Wow.

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:22.731
Yeah.

01:03:22.766 --> 01:03:27.669
It's supposed to give you
protection and good luck.

01:03:27.704 --> 01:03:28.870
Huh.

01:03:28.906 --> 01:03:33.875
This one, it's from Venice.

01:03:33.911 --> 01:03:38.046
I watched the guy finish it
right there.

01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:41.783
Wow. It's beautiful.

01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:42.851
I see a theme.

01:03:42.886 --> 01:03:43.852
Mmm.

01:03:43.887 --> 01:03:46.721
They're all something
you watched being made.

01:03:46.757 --> 01:03:48.423
That's my rule.

01:03:48.458 --> 01:03:52.761
They have to be handmade,
authentic.

01:03:52.796 --> 01:03:54.963
It matters.

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:58.433
It does.

01:03:58.468 --> 01:04:00.246
You just carry these
all around with you?

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:03.071
No, I-I sent for it.

01:04:03.106 --> 01:04:06.875
It's the closest thing that I
have to an ornament collection.

01:04:09.947 --> 01:04:13.048
You... you said that you wanted
everyone to have a-

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:16.718
a piece of themselves
on your tree.

01:04:16.753 --> 01:04:18.553
I want to be there, too.

01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:21.590
Just, whichever one
you want.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.260
Evan, I want them all
on the tree.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.801
I'm freezing cold.

01:04:32.836 --> 01:04:34.469
I need to go inside.

01:04:34.504 --> 01:04:36.471
I'm sorry. Of course.

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:39.007
Will you, uh, will you help me
put them on the tree?

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.509
Yeah. I would love that.

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:43.111
Great.

01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:44.779
Uh, just give me one second.

01:04:44.815 --> 01:04:45.925
I'll be right there, ok?

01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:47.415
Sure.

01:04:57.628 --> 01:04:59.728
[laughs]

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:05.433
[clicking]

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.147
Nadine, what're you
looking for?

01:05:08.171 --> 01:05:11.873
Talking to Zoe reminded me
of something and someone-

01:05:11.909 --> 01:05:15.277
well, William Shatner-
told me how to find him.

01:05:15.312 --> 01:05:19.447
And this just might
make someone's Christmas.

01:05:19.483 --> 01:05:20.483
Can I help you?

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:21.483
Back up off me, now.

01:05:21.518 --> 01:05:23.118
Let me work.

01:05:36.199 --> 01:05:37.799
Hey.

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:40.135
Hey.

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:42.504
I saved this one for you.

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:56.751
It's beautiful.

01:05:56.787 --> 01:05:58.820
Right?

01:05:58.855 --> 01:06:00.934
I think I finally figured out
why I bought them all

01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:03.491
in the first place.

01:06:08.532 --> 01:06:09.998
Hey.

01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:13.468
Dance with me.

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:21.443
Is this your dream?

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.078
Is what?

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:24.346
This place.

01:06:24.381 --> 01:06:26.548
Being here.

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:30.085
It's better than a dream,
because it's real.

01:06:34.825 --> 01:06:36.925
You're curious
about the world.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.627
I can see it.

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:44.799
Why are you always trying to
convince me to leave my home?

01:06:44.835 --> 01:06:47.869
Maybe because I'm tired
of being alone.

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:56.044
What?

01:06:56.079 --> 01:06:57.178
What?

01:06:57.214 --> 01:07:00.281
Uh, there's just work, uh,
I have left to do tonight.

01:07:00.317 --> 01:07:01.282
Right now?

01:07:01.318 --> 01:07:03.385
Yeah.

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:05.420
That's what happens
when you're running

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:07.789
a messy family business.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:14.295
[sighs]

01:07:26.009 --> 01:07:27.175
Hey, Callie.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:28.810
Is Sophie around?

01:07:28.845 --> 01:07:30.011
Uh, no.

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:32.447
I haven't seen her in a while.

01:07:43.026 --> 01:07:44.426
Sophie.

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:45.326
Merry Christmas.

01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:46.194
Frank.

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:47.940
Glad to run into you.
Saves me a call.

01:07:47.964 --> 01:07:48.863
Have you got a minute?

01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:51.132
Sure.

01:07:51.168 --> 01:07:53.701
I have a bidder who wants
to buy your notes

01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:55.448
so as a fiduciary
of the bank...

01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:56.504
Ok, stop.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.306
If I pay two months right now

01:07:58.341 --> 01:08:00.775
then I'm not officially
considered in arrears, right?

01:08:00.811 --> 01:08:03.011
I was reviewing my copy
of the mortgage.

01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:04.879
I... yes.

01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:06.681
Uh, technically that's true.

01:08:06.716 --> 01:08:07.649
Great.

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:08.550
Well, then I will have a payment
on your desk

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:11.653
when you open for business
on the 26th.

01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:14.122
Uh, we're still open today.

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:21.340
We're closing lift three for
a couple hours this afternoon

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:22.296
for maintenance-

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:23.631
That would be perfect.

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:24.911
I mean, I just need to get
rid of Evan

01:08:24.935 --> 01:08:25.867
for a couple hours today

01:08:25.902 --> 01:08:27.979
so his shiny company
doesn't buy my place out

01:08:28.004 --> 01:08:29.215
from underneath me
before I have a chance

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:30.839
to pull together this payment.

01:08:30.874 --> 01:08:32.540
It'll buy me two months.

01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:33.576
Yeah, alright.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:34.375
Thank you.

01:08:34.411 --> 01:08:35.210
Alright.

01:08:35.245 --> 01:08:36.421
Meet me here right after lunch,
ok?

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:37.479
Thank you.

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:39.481
Thank you.

01:08:49.392 --> 01:08:50.358
Evan.

01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:51.893
Evan, hey.

01:08:51.928 --> 01:08:53.328
Hey.

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:57.165
I've uh... I've been wanting
to talk to you.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.566
Oh, no. No talking.

01:08:58.602 --> 01:09:01.569
I have a surprise
and you have to, uh, change

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:05.607
into ski related clothing.

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:06.541
Ok.

01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:07.041
Hurry, hurry.

01:09:07.077 --> 01:09:09.010
Alright, alright.

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:15.194
So we have our own
private slope today?

01:09:15.218 --> 01:09:16.050
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:16.086 --> 01:09:17.196
The lift has been
under maintenance

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.554
so we're gonna be the first ones
back up the mountain.

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:20.854
Nice.

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:22.090
[message alert]

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:23.457
Sophie, uh, there's something

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:24.537
I've been wanting
to talk to you about.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.895
Oh, I have to deal with this.
You enjoy the run.

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:28.696
Ah, ah, ah, no.
One run.

01:09:28.732 --> 01:09:30.198
Evan!

01:09:39.743 --> 01:09:41.075
What? Good.

01:09:41.111 --> 01:09:42.477
Now we can finally talk.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.212
I should call Vince.

01:09:44.247 --> 01:09:47.381
I think you're avoiding me.

01:09:47.417 --> 01:09:48.349
You think?

01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:49.662
And I think that maybe
you heard something

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:50.919
and got the wrong impression.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.654
No, I know exactly
what I heard, Evan.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.223
I know why you're here.

01:09:55.258 --> 01:09:57.625
Maybe you've been making fun
of us this whole time,

01:09:57.661 --> 01:10:00.628
you know, the traditions
and our guests and my friends.

01:10:00.664 --> 01:10:01.296
What?

01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:02.297
But you have to understand.

01:10:02.332 --> 01:10:05.300
These people have cobbled
together a family.

01:10:05.335 --> 01:10:08.670
It's a family that...
that we cherish.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:09.904
That we chose.

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:10.905
And they need it,

01:10:10.941 --> 01:10:12.818
and I'm not gonna let
your company change it.

01:10:12.842 --> 01:10:14.442
I don't wanna change a thing.

01:10:14.477 --> 01:10:15.643
That's not true.

01:10:15.679 --> 01:10:16.978
I know that you made a bid.

01:10:17.013 --> 01:10:19.581
Yeah, Sophie, I had to get
your paperwork.

01:10:19.616 --> 01:10:20.927
If you just listen to what
I'm trying to-

01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:22.250
I have been listening.

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:23.451
That's the problem.

01:10:23.486 --> 01:10:25.620
I actually thought that...

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:28.456
I thought that we had something
special happening here and I...

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:29.257
There was.

01:10:29.292 --> 01:10:30.191
There is.

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:32.138
No, you've been working me
the entire time.

01:10:32.162 --> 01:10:35.997
Assessing the owner's
willingness.

01:10:36.032 --> 01:10:37.710
Wait, did you read
what was on my computer?

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:41.769
Don't say that like
I'm the sneaky one.

01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:45.340
I only came for one reason
but that's not why I stayed.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:46.375
I'm not selling.

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:47.375
What?

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:48.610
That's the bottom line.

01:10:48.645 --> 01:10:50.878
I will never sell.

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:51.179
What're you-

01:10:51.214 --> 01:10:52.313
Sophie!

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:54.060
Sophie, what're you doing?

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:55.516
Just...

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:57.452
Sophie, come on!

01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:28.683
How short are you?

01:11:28.718 --> 01:11:31.552
I mean, maybe if we pulled
everyone together-

01:11:31.588 --> 01:11:32.588
No, no, no.

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:34.989
I am not going full
George Bailey on everyone.

01:11:35.025 --> 01:11:38.159
Even if I felt ok about that,
which I don't,

01:11:38.194 --> 01:11:39.961
it wouldn't be enough.

01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:44.399
Oh, hey.

01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:46.834
It's been a good run.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:47.802
And who knows?

01:11:47.837 --> 01:11:50.204
Maybe we'll be able
to work together again.

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.018
Don't-I can't even stand
to think that I-

01:11:52.042 --> 01:11:53.741
Well, me neither.

01:11:53.777 --> 01:11:54.609
So we're not going to.

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:56.622
We're just gonna think
about Christmas

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:59.847
and we're gonna have
a great holiday.

01:11:59.883 --> 01:12:04.519

because it was buried

01:19:50.186 --> 01:19:53.521
Anyway, he's very apologetic
and, um,

I spoke to the lawyers,
double checked.

01:19:57.593 --> 01:20:00.995
It's valid.

01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:04.665
Wait, it says it should have
paid off the mortgage

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:06.066

all of that money back
with interest.

01:20:14.844 --> 01:20:16.655

will pay back quickly.

cause trouble.
