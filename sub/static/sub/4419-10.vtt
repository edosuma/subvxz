IT'S A GOOD THING WE GOT HER
TO THE HOSPITAL IN TIME.

00:40.815 --> 00:42.415
BUT WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER?

00:42.417 --> 00:43.382
IT'S CHICKENPOX.

00:43.384 --> 00:45.118
THERE SEEMS TO BE A SMALL
EPIDEMIC GOING AROUND.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.853
YOUR DAUGHTER NEVER
HAD THE CHICKENPOX

00:46.855 --> 00:48.054
AS A LITTLE GIRL,
I TAKE I?

00:48.056 --> 00:50.156
NO, NO, SHE'S BEEN
PERFECTLY HEALTHY.

00:50.158 --> 00:51.090
WELL, THAT'S
THE PROBLEM.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.892
YOU SEE, CHICKENPOX IS
A PRETTY NORMAL THING
WITH YOUNG CHILDREN,

00:52.894 --> 00:57.363
BUT AS YOU GET OLDER,
IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE
IT BECOMES A FEROCIOUS DISEASE.

00:57.365 --> 00:59.832
SHELLEY, LOOK WHO'S
COME TO VISIT YOU,

00:59.834 --> 01:02.201
YOUR LITTLE
BROTHER, STAN.

01:02.203 --> 01:03.269
OH, WHOOPEE!

01:03.271 --> 01:05.438
YOU KNOW,
MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE

01:05.440 --> 01:07.607
THAT CHICKENPOX IS ACTUALLY
A FORM OF HERPES.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.542
DUDE, YOU GOT HERPES
ON YOUR FACE!

01:09.544 --> 01:10.743
SHUT UP, BRAT!

01:10.745 --> 01:12.145
WILL MY DAUGHTER
BE OKAY?

01:12.147 --> 01:13.346
SHE'LL BE FINE.

01:13.348 --> 01:14.113
STOP IT!

01:14.115 --> 01:17.049
WE JUST WANT TO
BE CAUTIOUS AND
MONITOR HER HERE.

01:17.051 --> 01:17.550
( crash )

01:17.552 --> 01:22.288
COME ON, STANLEY,
GIVE YOUR SISTER A KISS,
AND THEN WE HAVE TO GO.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.958
AND THEN THE DOCTOR SAID THAT
IT'S MUCH WORSE AS YOU GET
OLDER.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.860
MY DAUGHTER IS IN
PRETTY BAD SHAPE NOW,

01:27.862 --> 01:29.929
BUT IF SHE WERE IN HER 20s,
SHE COULD DIE.

01:29.931 --> 01:33.966
MY GOD, I NEVER KNEW CHICKENPOX
WAS SUCH A DANGEROUS ILLNESS.

01:33.968 --> 01:36.736
I GUESS IT'S MUCH BETTER
TO GET IT WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG.

01:36.738 --> 01:37.537
SO TELL ME
IF I'M CRAZY,

01:37.539 --> 01:39.539
BUT I STARTED THINKING THAT
WE SHOULD INTENTIONALLY

01:39.541 --> 01:42.542
HAVE OUR BOYS PLAY WITH
A CHILD WHO HAS THE CHICKENPOX.

01:42.544 --> 01:44.477
LET THEM GET IT NOW
WHILE THEY'RE YOUNG.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.312
THAT'S NOT CRAZY
AT ALL, SHARON.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.480
MOTHERS DO IT
ALL THE TIME.

01:47.482 --> 01:50.082
OH, YES,
WHEN I WAS A CHILD,
MY MOTHER HAD ME

01:50.084 --> 01:53.219
GO OVER TO A LITTLE GIRL'S HOUSE
WHO HAD THE CHICKENPOX

01:53.221 --> 01:54.620
JUST SO I
WOULD GET IT.

01:54.622 --> 01:55.922
SO IT'S NOT SUCH A CRAZY
IDEA AFTER ALL?

01:55.924 --> 02:01.294
NO, NO, AND I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT STRANGE LITTLE BOY, KENNY,
HAS THE CHICKENPOX RIGHT NOW.

02:01.296 --> 02:02.762
ARE YOU GUYS HAVING A MEETING
OR SOMETHING?

02:02.764 --> 02:05.298
HOW WOULD YOU BOYS LIKE TO HAVE
A LITTLE SLUMBER PARTY

02:05.300 --> 02:06.999
AT YOUR FRIEND
KENNY'S HOUSE TONIGHT?

02:07.001 --> 02:08.901
NO WAY, DUDE.
KENNY'S FAMILY IS POOR--

02:08.903 --> 02:09.669
THEY LIVE IN THE GHETTO.

02:09.671 --> 02:10.970
YEAH, LET'S JUST HAVE
A SLUMBER PARTY HERE.

02:10.972 --> 02:15.041
BOYS, YOU'RE GOING TO
SLEEP OVER AT KENNY'S,
AND THAT'S FINAL.

02:15.043 --> 02:15.775
OH, WEAK!

02:15.777 --> 02:17.843
I WONDER WHY OUR MOMS WANT US

02:17.845 --> 02:19.412
TO SLEEP OVER KENNY'S SO BAD.

02:19.414 --> 02:20.246
YEAH, IT'S
PRETTY WEIRD.

02:20.248 --> 02:23.282
WELL, ALL I CAN SAY IS
HE BETTER HAVE NINTENDO.

03:10.365 --> 03:12.698
WHERE IS
THE NINTENDO?

03:12.700 --> 03:13.666
WE DON'T HAVE
A NINTENDO.

03:13.668 --> 03:17.336
WE GOT A "COLECOVISION" PLUGGED
INTO THE BLACK & WHITE TV.

03:17.338 --> 03:18.771
OH, MY GOD, THIS IS LIKE
A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY.

03:18.773 --> 03:22.842
THROW YOUR SLEEPING BAGS
IN KENNY'S ROOM, AND THEN
COME GRAB SOME DINNER.

03:22.844 --> 03:24.644
OH GOOD,
I'M STARVING!

03:28.616 --> 03:30.283
LET'S SAY GRACE.

03:30.285 --> 03:35.354
LORD, WE THANK YOU
FOR THIS STAGGERING
PAYLOAD OF FROZEN WAFFLES

03:35.356 --> 03:36.756
YOU HAVE BESTOWED
UPON US.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.557
AND SINCE WE HAVE BEEN
FAITHFUL TO YOU,

03:38.559 --> 03:42.261
WE KNOW THAT YOU WILL SEND US
SOME GOOD FORTUNE
ONE OF THESE DAYS,

03:42.263 --> 03:46.098
EVEN THOUGH YOU SURE AS HELL
SEEM TO BE TAKING
YOUR SWEET TIME.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.233
AMEN.

03:47.235 --> 03:48.501
AMEN.
AMEN.

03:48.503 --> 03:50.870
OKAY, LET'S DIG IN.

03:50.872 --> 03:52.004
THAT ONE'S MINE!
THAT ONE'S MINE!

03:52.006 --> 03:55.274
WHAT KIND OF SIDE DISHES
WILL WE BE ENJOYING
THIS EVENING

03:55.276 --> 03:57.910
WITH OUR FROZEN WAFFLES?

03:58.313 --> 04:00.880
AM I TO UNDERSTAND THERE
WILL BE NO SIDE DISHES?

04:00.882 --> 04:06.018
SO, KYLE, YOUR DAD
STILL BRINGING HOME
THOSE BIG FAT LAWYER PAYCHECKS?

04:06.020 --> 04:08.688
I DON'T KNOW.
STUART, DON'T EVEN
GET STARTED!

04:08.690 --> 04:10.156
WHAT, I'M JUST ASKING
A QUESTION.

04:10.158 --> 04:12.325
YOU KNOW, YOUR DAD AND I
USED TO BE BEST FRIENDS

04:12.327 --> 04:13.225
WHEN WE WERE TEENAGERS.

04:13.227 --> 04:14.994
WE EVEN WORKED TOGETHER
AT PIZZA SHACK.

04:14.996 --> 04:17.897
BUT HE GOT PROMOTED,
WENT OFF TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE,

04:17.899 --> 04:18.831
AND I DIDN'T.

04:18.833 --> 04:19.832
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

04:19.834 --> 04:21.567
'CAUSE YOUR
DAD'S JEWISH!

04:21.569 --> 04:22.702
I HEARD THAT.

04:22.704 --> 04:23.903
THAT AIN'T WHY,
STUART.

04:23.905 --> 04:26.138
IT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE
AN ALCOHOLIC RETARD,

04:26.140 --> 04:28.741
AND HE HAD DREAMS OF NOT EATIN'
FROZEN WAFFLES

04:28.743 --> 04:29.775
FOR DINNER EVERY NIGHT!

04:29.777 --> 04:31.477
HEY, IS IT MY FAULT YOU
DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK?

04:31.479 --> 04:34.447
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH FROZEN WAFFLES, CLAM HEAD?

04:34.449 --> 04:35.981
YOU PUT THEM IN THE TOASTER,
YOU COOK 'EM!

04:35.983 --> 04:39.285
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO USE SPICES AND STUFF.

04:39.287 --> 04:40.820
MY WAFFLE'S DONE!
MY WAFFLE'S DONE!

04:40.822 --> 04:43.022
NOW, KEVIN, WE AIN'T
GOT ENOUGH FOR EVERYBODY.

04:43.024 --> 04:44.824
YOU HAVE TO SPLIT THAT
WITH YOUR BROTHER.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.625
AH, JESUS, ARE YOU FUCKING
KIDDING ME?

04:46.627 --> 04:49.895
HEY, WE DON'T SAY "FUCK"
AT THE TABLE,
YOU LITTLE ASSHOLE!

04:49.897 --> 04:52.398
WE APPARENTLY WE DON'T SAY
"SIDE DISHES" EITHER.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.366
AH-CHOO!
KENNY, HONEY,

04:53.368 --> 04:55.668
IF YOU'RE GONNA SNEEZE,
SNEEZE ON THEM!

04:55.670 --> 04:57.169
HUH?
AH-CHOO!

04:57.171 --> 04:58.371
HEY!

04:59.507 --> 05:02.007
MAN, YOUR FAMILY
SUCKS ASS, KENNY.

05:02.009 --> 05:03.909
WHO EVER HEARD OF
FROZEN WAFFLES FOR DINNER?

05:03.911 --> 05:05.177
COME ON, LET'S GET
IN OUR SLEEPING BAGS

05:05.179 --> 05:06.846
AND GET THIS NIGHT
OVER WITH.

05:12.487 --> 05:13.386
CARTMAN, WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

05:13.388 --> 05:16.055
IT'S MY "URKEL" SLEEPING BAG.
ISN'T IT COOL?

05:16.057 --> 05:16.889
NO, IT'S NOT COOL.

05:16.891 --> 05:17.857
DUDE, I THINK I JUST
SAW A RAT.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.759
AAH! YOU HAVE RATS
IN YOUR HOUSE TOO, KENNY?!

05:19.761 --> 05:22.595
MM-HMM.
DUDE, SERIOUSLY, YOU BETTER
STOP BEING SO POOR,

05:22.597 --> 05:24.163
ELSE I'M GONNA START
HUCKING ROCKS AT YOU.

05:24.165 --> 05:26.465
I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY HEALTHY
TO SLEEP WITH RATS.

05:26.467 --> 05:29.001
( mumbling )

05:29.003 --> 05:30.569
OH.

05:30.571 --> 05:33.005
( clap, clap )

05:33.007 --> 05:34.874
AH-CHOO!

05:37.278 --> 05:39.011
OKAY, LEMME SEE.

05:39.013 --> 05:40.746
OH, GOODY,
YOU'VE GOT A FEVER!

05:40.748 --> 05:41.781
"GOODY"? WHAT DO YOU
MEAN, "GOODY"?

05:41.783 --> 05:45.117
YEP, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
CHICKENPOX ALL RIGHT.

05:45.119 --> 05:45.751
CHICKENP--
OH, NO.

05:45.753 --> 05:47.720
I MUST HAVE CAUGHT IT
FROM KENNY LAST NIGHT.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.088
OH, GEE,
I GUESS YOU DID.

05:49.090 --> 05:50.089
WELL, YOU SURE SEEM
HAPPY ABOUT IT.

05:50.091 --> 05:53.492
ALL RIGHT, IT'S OFF TO BED,
WITH YOU, YOUNG MAN.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.431
DON'T SCRATCH IT, HON'.

05:58.433 --> 06:02.134
BUT, MOM, IT ITCHES.
I CAN'T STAND IT!

06:02.136 --> 06:03.502
NO, HON'.

06:03.504 --> 06:04.837
IT ITCHES...

06:04.839 --> 06:07.473
HERE, I GOT YOU SOME
CALAMINE LOTION.

06:07.475 --> 06:08.140
I DON'T WANT IT.

06:08.142 --> 06:10.743
IT'LL MAKE YOUR
ITCHIES GO AWAY.

06:11.212 --> 06:14.346
EHH-- AHH.
HEY, GIMME THAT!

06:16.250 --> 06:16.849
AHH...

06:16.851 --> 06:19.385
NOT TOO MUCH, HON'.
IT SAYS ON THE BOTTLE

06:19.387 --> 06:20.986
THAT TOO MUCH CAN BE BAD.

06:20.988 --> 06:22.655
MORE CALAMINE LOTION!

06:23.591 --> 06:27.726
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT,
HE'S PERFECTLY HEALTHY.

06:27.728 --> 06:28.461
YEAH, I FEEL GREAT!

06:28.463 --> 06:30.396
ARE YOU SURE YOU
STAYED OVER AT KENNY'S HOUSE?

06:30.398 --> 06:33.165
YEAH, DUDE, I TOLD YOU,
WE HAD BREAD SANDWICHES
FOR BREAKFAST.

06:33.167 --> 06:35.067
DID YOU SLEEP
IN THE SAME ROOM?

06:35.069 --> 06:35.601
YES, WHY?

06:35.603 --> 06:37.736
BUBBY, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SPEND THE NIGHT

06:37.738 --> 06:38.971
AT YOUR FRIEND
KENNY'S HOUSE AGAIN?

06:38.973 --> 06:41.640
NO WAY, DUDE, IT SUCKED ASS.
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE CABLE.

06:41.642 --> 06:44.210
WELL, I THINK YOU NEED
TO SPEND MORE TIME
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

06:44.212 --> 06:46.979
KENNY'S NOT REALLY MY FRIEND,
MOM-- I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS
ABOUT HIM.

06:46.981 --> 06:49.381
I'M GONNA GIVE
MRS. McCORMICK A CALL.

06:49.383 --> 06:51.984
AW! HEY, DAD
IS IT TRUE THAT
YOU AND KENNY'S DAD

06:51.986 --> 06:53.419
USED TO BE BEST FRIENDS
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG?

06:53.421 --> 06:54.720
WHO, STUART?
YEAH, YEAH, I GUESS WE WERE.

06:54.722 --> 06:58.457
WELL, HOW COME KENNY'S FAMILY
EATS FROZEN WAFFLES FOR DINNER
AND HAS RATS ON THE FLOOR,

06:58.459 --> 06:59.959
AND WE HAVE A BIG HOUSE
AND LOTS OF FOOD?

06:59.961 --> 07:03.462
WELL, BECAUSE KENNY'S FAMILY
DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH MONEY
AS WE DO.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.663
BUT WHY? IF THEY'RE
HUNGRY AND POOR,

07:04.665 --> 07:06.632
WHY DON'T WE JUST
ALWAYS GIVE THEM
HALF OF OUR FOOD?

07:06.634 --> 07:10.970
( laughing ) OH, BOY, HAVE YOU
GOT A LOT TO LEARN!

07:10.972 --> 07:11.504
SIT DOWN, SON.

07:11.506 --> 07:14.473
YOU SEE, KYLE, WE HUMANS
WORK AS A SOCIETY,

07:14.475 --> 07:16.575
AND IN ORDER FOR
A SOCIETY TO THRIVE,

07:16.577 --> 07:18.878
WE NEED "GODS" AND "CLODS".

07:18.880 --> 07:19.512
GODS AND CLODS?

07:19.514 --> 07:21.580
YES. YOU SEE, I SPENT
A LOT OF TIME

07:21.582 --> 07:22.581
GOING TO LAW SCHOOL.

07:22.583 --> 07:23.382
AND I WAS ABLE TO GO
BECAUSE

07:23.384 --> 07:25.551
I HAVE A SLIGHTLY HIGHER
INTELLECT THAN OTHERS.

07:25.553 --> 07:27.386
BUT I STILL NEED PEOPLE
TO PUMP MY GAS

07:27.388 --> 07:29.922
AND MAKE MY FRENCH FRIES
AND FIX MY LAUNDRY MACHINE

07:29.924 --> 07:31.056
WHEN IT BREAKS DOWN.

07:31.058 --> 07:32.558
OH, I SEE--
GODS AND CLODS!

07:32.560 --> 07:35.895
THAT'S RIGHT.
SO KENNY'S FAMILY IS HAPPY
JUST THE WAY THEY ARE,

07:35.897 --> 07:39.698
AND WE'RE ALL
A FUNCTIONING PART OF AMERICA.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.736
STANLEY, CAN I GET
YOU ANYTHING ELSE?

07:44.872 --> 07:46.705
STANLEY?
OH, MY GOD!

07:46.707 --> 07:53.579
RANDY, RANDY, HURRY,
HE'S BURNING UP!

07:53.581 --> 07:56.415
DON'T YOU WORRY, STANLEY,
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.

07:56.417 --> 07:57.716
CAN I TALK TO
YOU OUTSIDE?

07:57.718 --> 08:00.052
KIDS, DADDY AND I
ARE GONNA BE RIGHT BACK.

08:00.054 --> 08:00.953
OKAY?
OKAY.

08:00.955 --> 08:02.888
SERVES YOU RIGHT,
YOU LITTLE BRAT!

08:02.890 --> 08:05.691
AT LEAST I'M NOT GONNA DIE
FROM IT LIKE YOU MIGHT.
( laughing )

08:05.693 --> 08:08.727
IF I DIE FROM THIS,
I'M TAKING YOU WITH ME!

08:08.729 --> 08:10.129
<i>( announcer )</i>
<i>WILL CAROL FIND OUT</i>
<i>SHE'S A...</i>

08:10.131 --> 08:12.731
I DON'T WANNA WATCH THIS!
I WANNA WATCH "TERRANCE &
PHILLIP."

08:12.733 --> 08:14.099
WE'RE WATCHING<i> THIS!</i>

08:14.101 --> 08:16.001
WELL, I'VE GOT
THE REMOTE, BITCH!
( laughs )

08:16.003 --> 08:19.672
Say, Terrance, would you check
my ass for abnormalities?

08:19.674 --> 08:20.406
Sure thing, Phillip.

08:20.408 --> 08:23.742
( farting )
Ha ha,
you got me again!

08:23.744 --> 08:25.644
That's tomfoolery!

08:25.646 --> 08:27.346
GIMME THE REMOTE!

08:27.348 --> 08:31.050
NO WAY, DUDE, WE'RE GONNA WATCH
"TERRENCE & PHILLIP" ALL DAY--

08:31.052 --> 08:33.252
OW, GET ME OUTTA HERE!

08:33.254 --> 08:37.122
HE'LL BE OKAY, BUT IT'S
A GOOD IDEA FOR US
TO MONITOR HIM FOR AWHILE.

08:37.124 --> 08:38.757
OH, GOD,
WHAT HAVE WE DONE?

08:38.759 --> 08:40.259
THERE, THERE, NOW.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

08:40.261 --> 08:42.628
DOCTOR, WE PURPOSELY
SENT OUR SON

08:42.630 --> 08:44.763
TO STAY WITH A FRIEND
WHO HAD CHICKENPOX,

08:44.765 --> 08:46.665
SO THAT HE WOULD
GET IT EARLY.

08:46.667 --> 08:47.833
OH, WOW, YOU DID?

08:47.835 --> 08:51.003
WOW...
YOU GUYS SUCK.

08:53.107 --> 08:54.473
CAN WE GO HOME NOW, MOM?

08:54.475 --> 08:57.142
NO, BUBBELE, YOU PLAY
WITH KENNY SOME MORE.

08:57.144 --> 08:58.577
BUT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING
FOR 8 HOURS!

08:58.579 --> 08:59.745
WE CAN'T THINK OF
ANYTHING ELSE TO DO.

08:59.747 --> 09:03.415
I'VE GOT A GREAT GAME FOR YOU.
IT'S CALLED "OOKY MOUTH".

09:03.417 --> 09:04.083
WHAT'S "OOKY MOUTH"?

09:04.085 --> 09:06.218
FIRST, YOU LET KENNY
SPIT IN YOUR MOUTH,

09:06.220 --> 09:07.920
THEN YOU TRY TO
SWALLOW HIS SPIT

09:07.922 --> 09:09.755
AND SAY "OOKY MOUTH"
AT THE SAME TIME.

09:09.757 --> 09:14.493
SICK, DUDE!
NO, NO, BUBBY,
IT'S LOADS OF FUN, TRY IT!

09:15.930 --> 09:17.196
THAT OUGHT TO
TAKE CARE OF IT.

09:17.198 --> 09:18.597
YOU WANT SOME MORE
HOT WATER?

09:18.599 --> 09:20.466
OH, NO, THANK YOU.
IT'S TERRIFIC, THOUGH...

09:20.468 --> 09:23.035
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
TEA BAGS OR COFFEE GROUNDS

09:23.037 --> 09:24.136
TO GO<i> IN</i> THE HOT WATER?

09:24.138 --> 09:27.773
NO, WE DON'T CARE FOR THAT
HOITY-TOITY RICH FOLK STUFF.

09:27.775 --> 09:29.675
I SEE. WELL,
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE

09:29.677 --> 09:31.410
A HUMBLE HOME,
MRS. McCORMICK.

09:31.412 --> 09:35.748
YEAH, WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
MY HUSBAND IS A WASHED UP
HUNK OF SHIT!

09:35.750 --> 09:37.216
OH, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

09:37.218 --> 09:38.417
( Kyle )
OOKY MOUTH.
( Kenny spits )

09:38.419 --> 09:41.020
( Kyle )
GROSS!
I CAN'T DO IT, MA!

09:41.022 --> 09:42.388
TRY AGAIN, BUBBY.

09:42.390 --> 09:43.622
( Kenny spits )
( Kyle)
AAH!

09:43.624 --> 09:44.790
YOU KNOW, YOUR HUSBAND
AND MINE

09:44.792 --> 09:46.592
USED TO WORK TOGETHER
AS TEENAGERS.

09:46.594 --> 09:49.628
OH, THEY WAS BEST FRIENDS.
YOU COULDN'T SEPARATE 'EM.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.331
REALLY?
I MET GERALD IN COLLEGE,

09:52.333 --> 09:53.432
SO I DIDN'T KNOW.

09:53.434 --> 09:54.466
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

09:54.468 --> 09:55.868
THEY JUST GREW APART,
I GUESS.

09:55.870 --> 09:56.969
I THINK STUART'S
A LITTLE JEALOUS

09:56.971 --> 09:58.737
THAT YOUR HUSBAND GOT OUT
OF MAKING PIZZAS

09:58.739 --> 10:00.973
WENT ON
TO MAKE SOMETHING OF HISSELF.

10:00.975 --> 10:01.974
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.809
I'M SURE YOUR HUSBAND IS
A FINE MAN.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.345
OH, HELL NO, HE'S A
NUGGET OF DEER TURD.

10:06.347 --> 10:07.680
BUT IF THEY WERE
SUCH GOOD FRIENDS,

10:07.682 --> 10:10.449
IT SEEMS SILLY THAT
THEY DON'T EVEN TALK ANYMORE.

10:10.451 --> 10:12.051
LET'S GET
THEM TOGETHER.

10:12.053 --> 10:12.718
I DON'T KNOW.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.521
WE'LL JUST ARRANGE
A LITTLE FISHING TRIP
FOR THEM OR SOMETHING.

10:15.523 --> 10:16.355
I CAN'T SAY
"OOKY MOUTH"

10:16.357 --> 10:18.557
AND HAVE KENNY SPIT DOWN
MY THROAT AT THE SAME TIME.

10:18.559 --> 10:19.358
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.560
PRACTICE
MAKES PERFECT, BUBBY

10:22.563 --> 10:25.431
GOD DAMMIT,
WHERE'S THAT CALAMINE LOTION?

10:25.433 --> 10:27.700
Phillip, I've got good news
and bad news.

10:27.702 --> 10:28.834
Give it to me straight,
Terrance.

10:28.836 --> 10:31.270
The good news is, you have
a clean bill of health.

10:31.272 --> 10:32.404
Oh, what a relief!

10:32.406 --> 10:34.740
The bad news is,
you have cancer.

10:34.742 --> 10:35.808
( gasp )
Cancer?!

10:35.810 --> 10:38.243
Yes, I'm afraid your ass
is collapsing.

10:38.245 --> 10:39.111
My ass is
collapsing?

10:39.113 --> 10:41.480
Yes. See this x-ray,
that's your ass.

10:41.482 --> 10:44.249
See that line?
That's your ass collapsing.

10:44.251 --> 10:45.517
Your ass
is collapsing!

10:45.519 --> 10:47.753
Will this mean I won't
be able to fart anymore?

10:47.755 --> 10:50.723
No it means you won't
be able to live anymore.

10:50.725 --> 10:53.859
( laughing )

10:53.861 --> 10:55.728
OH, NO.

10:55.730 --> 10:57.529
DAMMIT!
MEOW.

10:57.531 --> 11:00.566
NO, KITTY, THAT'S--
WAIT A MINUTE,
COME HERE, KITTY.

11:00.568 --> 11:02.968
YES...

11:02.970 --> 11:03.736
I'M BACK, HON'.

11:03.738 --> 11:05.404
I GOT SOME MORE
CALAMINE LOTION.

11:05.406 --> 11:08.407
IT'S ABOUT FREAKIN' TIME,
GIMME THAT!

11:08.409 --> 11:10.542
JUST USE A LITTLE BIT
OF THAT STUFF, HON'.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.611
IT HAS TO LAST A WHILE.

11:24.158 --> 11:25.924
YES...

11:25.926 --> 11:30.395
OH, YES...
( muttering )

11:33.234 --> 11:35.634
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU LIKED
TO FISH, GERRY.

11:35.636 --> 11:36.535
OH, YEAH, LOVE IT.

11:36.537 --> 11:37.936
I HAVEN'T DONE IT
FOR A WHILE, THOUGH.

11:37.938 --> 11:39.304
I HAD TO RUN OUT
AND BUY A FEW THINGS--

11:39.306 --> 11:42.474
YOU KNOW, A ROD, AND A REEL,
AND A, UH...

11:42.476 --> 11:44.276
TACKLE BOX?

11:44.278 --> 11:45.377
YEAH, TACKLE BOX.

11:45.379 --> 11:48.046
MAN, SMELL THAT
MOUNTAIN AIR.

11:48.048 --> 11:49.448
WHAT A GREAT
SATURDAY MORNING.

11:49.450 --> 11:50.616
AREN'T WEEKENDS
JUST THE BEST?

11:50.618 --> 11:53.752
WHEN YOU'RE UNEMPLOYED,
WEEKENDS ARE MEANINGLESS.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.654
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

11:55.656 --> 11:56.522
( bell ringing )

11:56.524 --> 12:01.627
AND SO, CHILDREN,
THAT'S HOW YOU TELL
A PROSTITUTE FROM A POLICEMAN.

12:01.629 --> 12:03.462
NOW, ARE THERE
ANY QUESTIONS?

12:03.464 --> 12:04.429
YES, KYLE?

12:04.431 --> 12:06.598
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH AMERICAN HISTORY?

12:06.600 --> 12:09.902
THAT'S GOOD QUESTION, KYLE.
ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

12:09.904 --> 12:11.670
MR. GARRISON,
I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE.

12:11.672 --> 12:13.238
EVERYONE ELSE HAS
CHICKEN-HERPES.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.540
RIGHT, RIGHT.
UH...

12:14.542 --> 12:17.442
WELL, CLASS, I'M GONNA
ASSIGN YOU ALL A PAPER.

12:17.444 --> 12:22.247
THE THEME OF THE PAPER WILL BE,
"HOW I WOULD MAKE AMERICA
BETTER".

12:22.249 --> 12:24.483
WHAT? DOES EVERYBODY HAVE
TO DO IT OR JUST ME?

12:24.485 --> 12:26.185
DON'T WORRY, KYLE,
I'M SENDING HOMEWORK

12:26.187 --> 12:27.886
TO ALL THE CHILDREN
WHO ARE OUT SICK.

12:27.888 --> 12:29.354
THEY'LL HAVE TO
TURN IN A PAPER, TOO.

12:29.356 --> 12:31.323
( Stan)
HOMEWORK--
BUT I'M IN THE HOSPITAL!

12:31.325 --> 12:33.025
WELL, YOUR TEACHER SENT
THIS STUFF OVER

12:33.027 --> 12:34.126
FOR YOU TO DO
WHILE YOU'RE SICK.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.261
THAT SON OF A BITCH, WHAT KIND
OF A SICK WEIRDO IS HE?!

12:36.263 --> 12:40.499
NOW, STANLEY, I KNOW
AT YOUR AGE TEACHERS CAN SEEM
COLD AND HEARTLESS,

12:40.501 --> 12:43.969
BUT LATER YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT
HE DID THIS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.705
NOT MR. GARRISON, MA.
HE REALLY IS A SICK WEIRDO.

12:46.707 --> 12:47.840
YEAH, IT'S TRUE, HE IS.

12:47.842 --> 12:51.310
OH, WELL, ANYWAY,
HERE'S A PENCIL AND SOME PAPER.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.244
WAIT, WHERE ARE
YOU GOING?

12:52.246 --> 12:53.879
WE'RE GOING DOWN
TO HAPPY BURGER

12:53.881 --> 12:54.646
FOR SOME MILK SHAKES.

12:54.648 --> 12:58.217
MILK SHAKES?
YEAH, AND THEN WE'RE GOING
TO THE MOVIES.

12:58.219 --> 13:00.018
SEE YA, SON.
WEAK!

13:00.020 --> 13:03.322
"SO THIS IS HOW AMERICA WORKS:
WE HAVE 'GODS' AND 'CLODS'.

13:03.324 --> 13:06.859
"MY DAD SAYS AMERICA NEEDS
BOTH RICH AND POOR TO SURVIVE,

13:06.861 --> 13:07.993
BUT I HAVE
A BETTER IDEA--"

13:07.995 --> 13:10.329
NO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT,
DR. SCHWARTZ,

13:10.331 --> 13:11.763
HE'S PERFECTLY HEALTHY.

13:11.765 --> 13:14.533
HE'S BEEN OVER AT KENNY'S HOUSE
3 DAYS IN A ROW

13:14.535 --> 13:16.668
AND STILL HASN'T CAUGHT
THE CHICKENPOX!

13:16.670 --> 13:18.370
WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

13:18.372 --> 13:21.039
WE SENT THE OTHER BOYS OVER,
AND THEY ALL GOT SICK,

13:21.041 --> 13:23.842
BUT I CAN'T GET
MY LITTLE KYLE TO CATCH IT.

13:23.844 --> 13:24.409
OH, MY GOD!

13:24.411 --> 13:26.378
KYLE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING THERE, HONEY?

13:26.380 --> 13:29.581
YOU!
I'LL CALL YOU BACK,
DR. SCHWARTZ.

13:29.583 --> 13:30.349
YOU!

13:30.351 --> 13:31.850
WHAT, BUBBELE?
WHAT IS IT?

13:31.852 --> 13:34.286
YOU SENT US OVER
TO KENNY'S HOUSE ON PURPOSE.

13:34.288 --> 13:35.854
YOU WANTED US
TO GET SICK!

13:35.856 --> 13:37.856
OY, IT WAS FOR
YOUR OWN GOOD, KYLE.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.958
I WANTED YOU TO GET CHICKENPOX
WHILE YOU WERE YOUNG.

13:39.960 --> 13:43.662
WHY, SO I COULD BE SITTING
IN THE HOSPITAL, WAITING
TO DIE LIKE STAN?

13:43.664 --> 13:44.863
NOW, KYLE, COME HERE.

13:44.865 --> 13:47.165
YOU GET AWAY FROM ME,
YOU CRAZY WOMAN!

13:47.167 --> 13:50.903
OH, BOY.

13:50.905 --> 13:53.906
BEER?
HUH? OH, NO THANKS,
I BROUGHT MY OWN.

13:53.908 --> 13:55.540
MICROBREW SAMPLER
FROM ASPEN.

13:55.542 --> 13:58.510
HAS SIX DIFFERENT BEERS
FROM LOCAL BREWERIES.

13:59.146 --> 14:01.446
SAY, REMEMBER THAT TIME
WE BUILT A FORT

14:01.448 --> 14:03.015
IN YOUR MOM'S BACKYARD?

14:03.017 --> 14:04.516
HEH, HEH, YEAH.

14:04.518 --> 14:06.752
IT TOOK US DAMN NEAR
TWO YEARS TO FINISH IT.

14:06.754 --> 14:10.923
WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO
THAT OLD HUNK OF JUNK?

14:10.925 --> 14:12.691
THAT'S WHERE
I LIVE NOW.

14:12.693 --> 14:13.492
OH, RIGHT.

14:13.494 --> 14:17.262
THAT'S WHY "KNIGHT RIDER"
WAS THE BEST SHOW IN AMERICA.

14:17.264 --> 14:17.863
STAN, STAN!

14:17.865 --> 14:19.965
SHH. WAKE HER UP
AND WE'RE BOTH DEAD.

14:19.967 --> 14:20.565
SORRY, SORRY.

14:20.567 --> 14:22.100
YOU KNOW HOW AFTER WE SPENT
THE NIGHT AT KENNY'S HOUSE,

14:22.102 --> 14:23.869
AND THEN YOU AN CARTMAN GOT
SICK WITH CHICKENPOX?

14:23.871 --> 14:26.204
YEAH.
DUDE, OUR PARENTS SENT US
OVER THERE

14:26.206 --> 14:27.673
TO GET US SICK!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:27.675 --> 14:30.142
THEY KNEW THAT STAYING
AT KENNY'S HOUSE
WOULD MAKE US SICK,

14:30.144 --> 14:31.143
AND THEY MADE US
DO IT ANYWAY.

14:31.145 --> 14:33.578
THEY DID?
YEAH, AND I THINK
I FIGURED OUT WHY.

14:33.580 --> 14:36.715
WHY?
BECAUSE THEY'RE A
BUNCH OF ASSHOLES.

14:36.717 --> 14:37.649
OF COURSE.

14:37.651 --> 14:39.351
COME ON, DUDE,
WE GOTTA GET
OUT OF HERE.

14:39.353 --> 14:40.719
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE PLANNING NEXT,

14:40.721 --> 14:41.586
BUT IT CAN'T BE GOOD.

14:41.588 --> 14:43.722
"I HOPE THAT
ONE DAY AMERICA

14:43.724 --> 14:47.759
"CAN BE MORE LIKE ENDOR,
WHERE THE EWOKS LIVE.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.361
ENDOR IS VERY CU--"

14:49.363 --> 14:52.431
( doorbell )
MOM, ANSWER THAT!

14:52.433 --> 14:55.400
"THEY HAVE TREES
AND EWOKS AND BARBECUES,

14:55.402 --> 14:59.604
"WHICH IS WHY I LIKE ENDOR
MORE THAN AMERICA.

14:59.606 --> 15:01.239
IT'S COOL."

15:01.241 --> 15:03.675
CARTMAN, YOU REMEMBER
HOW WE ALL SPENT THE NIGHT
AT KENNY'S

15:03.677 --> 15:04.443
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO?

15:04.445 --> 15:06.144
I REMEMBER FROZEN WAFFLES
WITH NO SIDE DISHES.

15:06.146 --> 15:09.414
CARTMAN, OUR PARENTS SENT US
OVER THERE TO CATCH CHICKENPOX
FROM KENNY.

15:09.416 --> 15:12.884
YEAH, DUDE, YOUR MOM WANTED YOU
TO HAVE HERPES ON YOUR FACE.

15:12.886 --> 15:13.452
SHE WHAT?

15:13.454 --> 15:14.886
IT'S SOME KIND OF
PARENTAL CONSPIRACY.

15:14.888 --> 15:16.688
OUR PARENTS ARE TRYING TO
KILL US OR SOMETHING.

15:16.690 --> 15:18.490
THAT BITCH!
I'M GONNA GO DOWNSTAIRS

15:18.492 --> 15:19.992
AND KICK HER SQUARE
IN THE NUTS!

15:19.994 --> 15:22.461
NO, NO, NO, COME ON, FAT ASS.
WE'RE GONNA GET 'EM ALL BACK.

15:22.463 --> 15:25.130
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND
ANOTHER JOB SOON.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.064
SOMETHING WILL
COME ALONG.

15:26.066 --> 15:28.233
NOT THAT EASY.
YOU WERE LUCKY.

15:28.235 --> 15:29.935
NO, NO, I WASN'T LUCKY.

15:29.937 --> 15:30.635
YOU HAD RICH
PARENTS...

15:30.637 --> 15:32.971
YOU GOT TO GO TO THAT
EXPENSIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

15:32.973 --> 15:36.475
HEY, I WORKED MY ASS OFF TO
GET TO WHERE I AM TODAY!

15:36.477 --> 15:37.876
I WANTED TO
BE SOMEBODY!

15:37.878 --> 15:39.111
I WANTED TO
BE SOMEBODY, TOO.

15:39.113 --> 15:42.080
I JUST WASN'T BORN WITH
A SILVER ENEMA UP MY ASS.

15:42.082 --> 15:42.781
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS.

15:42.783 --> 15:45.484
YOU'RE A BITTER OLD DRUNK,
JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER. OW!

15:45.486 --> 15:47.953
NOW, DON'T MAKE ME
DO THAT AGAIN.

15:47.955 --> 15:50.022
OW!
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

15:50.024 --> 15:52.891
( both grunting )

15:52.893 --> 15:55.460
DOCTOR?
YES.

15:55.462 --> 15:56.595
WHERE'S STAN?

15:56.597 --> 15:58.864
STAN?
STAN, OUR SON?

15:58.866 --> 16:00.465
OH, YES,
WHERE IS STAN?

16:00.467 --> 16:02.134
YOU MEAN
STANLEY'S MISSING?

16:02.136 --> 16:03.235
NO, NO, HE'S
NOT MISSING.

16:03.237 --> 16:06.038
WE JUST CAN'T SEEM TO
FIND HIM AT THIS MOMENT.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.240
OH, MY GOD,
OUR SON RAN AWAY.

16:08.242 --> 16:10.108
WILL HE BE OKAY
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL?

16:10.110 --> 16:10.876
OH, SURE, SURE...

16:10.878 --> 16:11.810
BUT WE HAVE TO
GET HIM BACK SOON.

16:11.812 --> 16:14.646
IF HE DOESN'T GET HIS ANTIBIOTIC
SHOT TODAY, HE COULD DIE.

16:14.648 --> 16:16.114
DIE?
YES, DIE.

16:16.116 --> 16:17.015
IT WON'T BE AN
EASY DEATH EITHER.

16:17.017 --> 16:20.252
THE CHICKENPOX WILL SLOWLY MOVE
DOWN HIS TRACHEA INTO HIS LUNGS.

16:20.254 --> 16:21.353
OKAY, WELL,
LET'S GO LOOK.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.254
AS HE CHOKES
FOR BREATH,

16:22.256 --> 16:23.321
THE POX WILL MOVE
THROUGH HIS INNER EAR

16:23.323 --> 16:26.224
INTO HIS BRAIN, MAKING HIM THINK
HE'S DAVID DUCHOVNY.

16:26.226 --> 16:27.059
OH, GOD, NO!

16:27.061 --> 16:28.093
I'M SURE HE COULDN'T
HAVE GONE FAR.

16:28.095 --> 16:30.362
NOW MOVING ON ALL FOURS AND
WHEEZING UNCONTROLLABLY,

16:30.364 --> 16:34.299
HIS CELLULAR STRUCTURE WILL
REGRESS INTO A GELATINOUS MASS--

16:34.968 --> 16:35.967
SO HOW WAS IT?

16:35.969 --> 16:38.203
DID YOU BOYS HAVE
A GOOD TIME FISHING?

16:38.205 --> 16:40.572
THAT SON OF A BITCH
RIPPED MY PARKA!

16:40.574 --> 16:41.773
CATCH ANYTHING?

16:41.775 --> 16:42.574
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

16:42.576 --> 16:43.842
WHY WOULD HE
INVITE ME FISHING

16:43.844 --> 16:45.477
AND THEN TURN INTO
A COMPLETE BASTARD?

16:45.479 --> 16:47.446
WELL, DARLING, I HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

16:47.448 --> 16:50.282
HE DIDN'T INVITE YOU.
I SET THE WHOLE THING UP.

16:50.284 --> 16:51.850
WHAT? NOW, WHY THE HELL
WOULD YOU

16:51.852 --> 16:53.552
KNOWINGLY DECEIVE ME
LIKE THAT?

16:53.554 --> 16:54.953
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE GOOD FOR YOU.

16:54.955 --> 16:57.789
JUST LIKE YOU DECEIVED OUR,
SON INTO GOING TO KENNY'S?

16:57.791 --> 16:59.224
AND THAT DIDN'T
WORK EITHER!

16:59.226 --> 17:00.926

BEST I CAN!

HOW DOES SOMEONE
GET HERPES?

17:53.447 --> 17:55.080
WELL, YOU GET IT
BY SHARING RELATIONS

17:55.082 --> 17:56.414
WITH SOMEBODY
WHO ALREADY HAS IT.

17:56.416 --> 17:59.618
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL
AROUND SOMEONE WHO HAS HERPES.

DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY
WITH HERPES?

AWAY FROM HER.

GIVE SOMEBODY HERPES?
