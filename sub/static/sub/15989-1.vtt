01:54.865 --> 01:56.325
<i>Look at me.</i>

01:56.366 --> 01:57.743
<i>Look at the kite.</i>

02:15.219 --> 02:16.553
<i>Jack...</i>

04:07.581 --> 04:10.292
Oh, I've seen that outfit before.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.669
I can't remember when.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.464
- Last night.
- Last night!

04:16.757 --> 04:18.382
These things do return.

04:18.466 --> 04:22.346
God, my head is still pounding
like a drum.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.972
You party hard.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.392
Yeah, well, you don't look
worse than I am.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.436
I didn't drink as much as you.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.396
History of my life, Sara.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.108
Psychiatrist by day,
party animal by night.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.736
I thought you've told me
you were a lawyer.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.613
I'm not, yet.

04:42.533 --> 04:43.867
Excuse me.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.621
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, Jack. It's Shelly.</i>

04:47.955 --> 04:50.958
<i>- I've been calling all morning. You OK?
- I'm Ok. What's up?</i>

04:51.041 --> 04:51.959
I was worried.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.711
You worry too much, Shelly.
What's going on?

04:55.045 --> 04:57.381
Frank Parks is been calling.
He needs to speak with you immediately.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.132
Pass him through.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.596
I had fun last night,
Miss. Pollard.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.139
Me too.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.934
Thanks for the wine tasting,
Dr. Gramm.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.519
Jack.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.898
<i>Hey, Jack, I've got Frank Parks.
Go ahead.</i>

05:15.065 --> 05:16.984
- Hey, Frank.
- Jack.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.570
We got another one.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.655
Oh, no. The same?

05:21.905 --> 05:22.781
<i>Every detail.</i>

05:23.574 --> 05:25.284
Right down
to the lateral laceration.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.206
<i>It's the Seattle slayer again.</i>

05:31.498 --> 05:33.417
<i>- Where are you now?
- Look, Jack.</i>

05:34.001 --> 05:35.419
<i>There's a tape.</i>

05:35.961 --> 05:37.421
You're gonna wanna see it.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.175
<i>Jack, are you still there?</i>

05:42.843 --> 05:44.094
Yeah.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.018
Meet me at my office, okay?

05:51.185 --> 05:52.686
<i>Sure, Jack.</i>

06:15.250 --> 06:16.293
Where to?

06:16.502 --> 06:18.921
114 Western, please.
Quickly.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.846
<i>Welcome back, Seattle.</i>

06:27.930 --> 06:30.933
<i>We're continuing our interview
with John Forster...</i>

06:31.141 --> 06:34.520
<i>who was convicted for the death
of Janie Kay, nine years ago...</i>

06:34.686 --> 06:38.857
<i>based on the eyewitness testimony
of her twin sister, Janie Kay.</i>

06:39.149 --> 06:42.277
<i>John Forster was dated to die at
midnight, at Walla Walla Penitentiary.</i>

06:42.319 --> 06:44.029
<i>- Do you mind changing it?
- John Forster.</i>

06:44.112 --> 06:45.822
<i>What's your reaction
to the State...</i>

06:48.742 --> 06:49.743
Thank you.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.213
Idiot!

07:34.788 --> 07:36.123
Congratulations!

07:37.708 --> 07:39.084
For what?

07:39.251 --> 07:42.504
I was referring to the hottie that
you left with the party last night.

07:42.588 --> 07:44.006
She was a quite piece of ass.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.800
- Remember her name?
- Yes, I do.

07:47.009 --> 07:48.343
Sara Pollard.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.805
Is that a cut on your nose?
You didn't have that before I left.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.558
I fell out of the bed.
FBI hit here yet?

07:54.641 --> 07:57.603
- Yeah, 2 minutes in the conference room.
- Okay.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.479
Any calls?

07:59.688 --> 08:01.732
New York Times, Washington times,
Newsweek.

08:01.815 --> 08:05.152
They all wanna know if you have a quote
about Forster's execution.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.155
- What else is new?
- Kim Cummings called twice.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.824
- She was worried about you too.
- Kim knows this procedure.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.535
Apparently not.
She's in your office.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.163
Jack Gramm Associates.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.291
I put those case reports
you wanna me to look at on your desk.

08:19.374 --> 08:23.212
I thought Lauren and Leeza showed
real insight and ability.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.297
The others were pretty much
working the math.

08:25.464 --> 08:26.507
Yeah.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.138
Don't you have Federal Agents
waiting for you?

08:35.224 --> 08:36.058
Yeah.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.018
I' see you in class.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.895
I'll take them trough today's work
if you run late.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.397
Thanks.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.483
- Thank you, Kim.
- Bye.

08:47.611 --> 08:50.656
Janie Keith came by
to give you a present.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.407
Dr. Gramm.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.701
I'm sorry.
I don't know if this is appropriate...

08:54.785 --> 08:56.203
I just wanted to...

08:56.620 --> 08:59.039
I just wanted to mark the day.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.415
Thank you, Janie.

09:00.624 --> 09:04.753
I'm glad that my sister Janie
hasn't been forgotten. Thank you.

09:05.170 --> 09:08.131
For everything.
You went out of your way.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.969
You are busy, so I'm just...
I'm gonna get out of here.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.806
We did good, Janie.
We did good.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.140
All right.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.600
Thanks.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.273
Can I help you?

09:24.565 --> 09:26.066
You are one of my students?

09:26.316 --> 09:27.568
Hi.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.611
- Jack.
- Yeah.

09:29.820 --> 09:33.532
I'd like to introduce you to Jeremy
Goober, with attorney general office.

09:33.991 --> 09:36.785
Jeremy is in charge
of the Seattle slayer task force.

09:36.869 --> 09:40.789
Dr. Gramm, it's so good to meet you.
This is a really big honor for me.

09:40.831 --> 09:42.124
Sorry about the...

09:42.332 --> 09:44.209
Oh, this is such a beautiful
conference room too.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.920
And this special agent
MacTire from the FBI.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.213
Dr. Gramm.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.424
Pleasure. Have a seat.

09:52.509 --> 09:53.886
Hey, big fellow?

09:54.136 --> 09:55.137
Yes.

09:56.805 --> 09:57.973
Jeremy.

09:59.558 --> 10:02.811
Seattle slayer task force.

10:02.853 --> 10:07.149
Well, okay.
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

10:07.858 --> 10:11.862
I'll do the best I can to answer them,
but first I...

10:12.779 --> 10:17.075
No. First I think we should all
have a cookie.

10:17.242 --> 10:22.289
These are from Janie Kay, whose sister,
Janie was murdered by John Forster.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.209
- Jeremy?
- Sure, thank you.

10:26.543 --> 10:29.755
- Frank?
- No, thanks, Jack.

10:30.047 --> 10:31.256
No?

10:31.757 --> 10:33.217
Mr. MacTire?

10:35.052 --> 10:36.803
You are a good sport, Jeremy.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.765
A little milk maybe,
what do you think?

10:43.727 --> 10:47.356
Shelley, we got milk, don't we?
Bring in three glasses.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.233
Nothing for me, Jack.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.151
All right, make that two.

10:51.235 --> 10:52.736
No, make it three.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.405
Maybe you have a change of heart.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.492
So, let's see...

10:59.993 --> 11:01.411
I can assume...

11:01.912 --> 11:04.706
that last night crime scene...

11:04.748 --> 11:08.085
was very much like
Forster's previous crime scene, right?

11:08.168 --> 11:10.462
- They totally match, yeah.
- What totally matches?

11:12.256 --> 11:14.132
I have in here...

11:20.264 --> 11:22.891
- Halothane on the breath.
- Subdued by Halothane.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.643
- Rape.
- Yeah.

11:24.977 --> 11:27.020
The body was hung up side down.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.021
Yes.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.273
And...

11:32.109 --> 11:33.610
slashed throat.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.115
- And where this takes us?
- Looks like a copy cat.

11:39.241 --> 11:41.326
- It could be. Maybe
- Could be? Maybe?

11:41.952 --> 11:44.663
- Maybe.
- It's a stage scene. Maybe what?

11:44.872 --> 11:47.332
Maybe,
and this might be far-fetched...

11:47.541 --> 11:50.460
but what if the perp
worked with Forster...

11:50.669 --> 11:54.882
and these stage scenes were intended to
throw some doubts on his guilty verdict?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.384
- Go with it.
- Possibly providing him...

11:57.467 --> 12:00.929
with a stay of execution
or even a new trial.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.766
Goal star, Jeremy.
Big goal star.

12:04.975 --> 12:07.519
I mean, that's exactly what I think
is happening here.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.939
No, I'm sticking with copy cat.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.609
Of course there is
another possibility.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.736
- Yeah?
- Forster is innocent.

12:15.986 --> 12:17.446
- Wrongly convicted.
- No!

12:17.654 --> 12:19.281
The task force is aware...

12:19.489 --> 12:22.492
that your expert opinion
was critical in convicting Forster.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.494
But then why he walked
his first trial?

12:24.578 --> 12:25.871
Procedural error.

12:26.038 --> 12:29.082
Why is he never been tried in any
of the other five pending murderers...

12:29.166 --> 12:31.126
that you've attributed to him?

12:32.169 --> 12:35.464
You realize that it is the dude of my
office to ensure that an innocent man...

12:35.506 --> 12:38.509
is not executed tonight.
You do understand that?

12:38.759 --> 12:43.055
Look, Jack. If you have
any reconsideration of testimony...

12:43.305 --> 12:45.641
or anything new you wanna lay
on the table...

12:45.849 --> 12:47.226
now it would be the time.

12:47.351 --> 12:48.936
Would you say it was fair
to characterize...

12:49.019 --> 12:50.354
your attitude towards
John Forster...

12:50.437 --> 12:54.691
- as a personal vendetta?
- Lf we're been fair, yeah, sure.

12:54.983 --> 12:58.278
It's a personal vendetta. I have
a personal vendetta against Ted Bundy...

12:58.529 --> 13:02.115
and Gacy and about 10 or 15
other serial murders...

13:02.324 --> 13:04.409
- that are on the streets right now.
- Jack, please.

13:04.701 --> 13:05.744
That's helpful.

13:06.662 --> 13:09.081
There is one other issue
that we need to address.

13:09.414 --> 13:10.791
Milk maid.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.934
What's going on here?

13:29.226 --> 13:32.104
Do you know a woman named
Dale Morris?

13:32.521 --> 13:33.730
Yes.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.440
How?

13:35.941 --> 13:38.902
- She's a student of mine.
- She's just a student of yours?

13:39.903 --> 13:43.156
Dr. Gramm, we're federal agency here.
You don't wanna be lying here.

13:43.407 --> 13:46.869
- We had a relationship.
- You've been very cryptic right now?

13:47.202 --> 13:51.248
He had a professional relationship,
not a sexual relationship.

13:51.915 --> 13:55.002
About a year ago her father died.
She was very troubled.

13:55.252 --> 13:58.213
I treated her as psychiatrist.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.258
I don't sleep with my students,
Mr. Goober.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.719
Neither I sleep with my patients.

14:04.803 --> 14:09.016
Now what does this have to do
with anything? Anyway.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.767
Jack.

14:11.185 --> 14:13.604
Dale Morris was murdered
last night.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.898
She's the third and latest victim.

14:19.276 --> 14:21.486
When was the last time
you saw Dale?

14:22.779 --> 14:24.031
Well...

14:24.698 --> 14:25.991
I saw...

14:30.579 --> 14:31.955
I saw her last night.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.960
To our impossibly
difficult professor.

14:37.503 --> 14:39.671
We say thank you...

14:40.797 --> 14:43.091
for making our lives miserable.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.552
The pleasure is all mine.

14:54.311 --> 14:55.437
We're celebrating.

14:55.479 --> 14:57.648
You're celebrating
Forster's pending execution?

14:58.649 --> 15:04.363
No, we're celebrating his conviction,
not his execution.

15:04.947 --> 15:08.867
It was an overturn so we're happy
about that. We worked hard on this case.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.995
We have a tape
that was left on the crime scene.

15:13.730 --> 15:15.649
We're gonna play it for you now.

15:17.376 --> 15:20.671
<i>This message is for
Dr. Jack Gramm.</i>

15:23.423 --> 15:25.592
<i>You got the wrong man.</i>

15:25.843 --> 15:27.219
<i>Forster is innocent.</i>

15:27.302 --> 15:29.680
<i>Please, don't hurt me anymore.</i>

15:29.888 --> 15:32.099
<i>Don't hurt me anymore.</i>

15:33.392 --> 15:35.477
<i>You gonna let me go, right?</i>

15:37.479 --> 15:40.732
<i>You said you'd let me go.
I've read what you want me and...</i>

15:51.618 --> 15:55.163
Jack, it goes like that for about
an hour, before she dies.

15:55.372 --> 15:58.500
Why do you think she was reading you
that message, Dr. Gramm?

16:05.257 --> 16:06.466
Dr. Gramm?

16:06.884 --> 16:08.260
Dr. Gramm?

16:08.552 --> 16:10.179
<i>In Dr. Gramm own words...</i>

16:10.262 --> 16:12.514
<i>he analyzes a mental puzzle.</i>

16:12.764 --> 16:15.559
<i>So they're no actual tangible pieces
per say.</i>

16:16.268 --> 16:18.270
<i>He made a guess based on what
happened to Kate.</i>

16:18.353 --> 16:22.024
<i>A guess based on his intuition,
a personal bias, ego.</i>

16:22.232 --> 16:25.777
<i>And he sold that fiction lock, stock
and barrel to the jury.</i>

16:28.447 --> 16:30.032
What is it?

16:36.538 --> 16:39.041
The girl that was killed
last night...

16:39.541 --> 16:42.044
- was Dale Morris.
- Dale?

16:44.379 --> 16:45.506
Oh, my God.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.510
Okay, let's see...

16:49.843 --> 16:52.888
We have our investigators coordinated
with the FBI...

16:53.096 --> 16:58.352
I wanna know everything Dale Morris did
on the last 24 hours.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.729
I wanna know where she went,
who she talked to.

17:00.938 --> 17:03.607
Can you please have Dr. Gramm's car
ready, please. Thank you.

17:05.943 --> 17:07.611
Thank you, Shelley.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.154
For what?

17:10.614 --> 17:13.659
- I don't know. For everything.
- I hate when you do this, Jack.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.411
Every time you o this,
I think you gonna end up dead.

17:18.955 --> 17:21.250
Just don't ask me to marry you
again.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.126
Why not?
We're perfect for each other.

17:23.210 --> 17:27.214
Yeah, yeah. Except that I'm gay
and you're commitment phobe.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.424
That's why we're perfect.

17:31.343 --> 17:33.011
Thanks, baby.

17:35.514 --> 17:38.851
<i>Dr. Gramm is a world known expert
in forensic psychiatry.</i>

17:39.142 --> 17:41.770
<i>What is forensic psychiatry?</i>

17:42.729 --> 17:45.274
<i>I mean, is not the same profession
that destroyed MacMorton's life...</i>

17:45.357 --> 17:48.193
<i>by conjuring up images
of child molestation?</i>

17:48.402 --> 17:51.697
<i>None of the charges were ever proved.
And the accused, though innocent...</i>

17:51.905 --> 17:53.031
<i>was public crucified.</i>

18:18.182 --> 18:20.350
<i>Jack, look. Look at the kite.</i>

18:23.353 --> 18:24.855
<i>Jack, come here.</i>

19:16.031 --> 19:17.199
Yeah?

19:18.075 --> 19:19.576
Hello?

19:22.079 --> 19:23.747
Hello?

19:23.830 --> 19:26.250
<i>You have 88 minutes to live.</i>

19:26.291 --> 19:27.167
What?

19:27.251 --> 19:29.628
<i>You know how long 88 minutes can be,
don't you?</i>

19:29.711 --> 19:32.047
<i>- That's 11:45 am.
- Who is this?</i>

19:32.256 --> 19:34.049
<i>- Tic-tac.
- Who the hell is this?</i>

19:34.258 --> 19:35.676
<i>Tic-tac.</i>

19:36.760 --> 19:38.262
What were you saying?

19:53.735 --> 19:55.988
<i>- Jack Gramm Associates.
- Shelley?</i>

19:56.154 --> 19:58.448
I want you to set a trap and
and a trace on my cell.

19:58.615 --> 19:59.366
<i>What's going on?</i>

19:59.449 --> 20:02.578
I want you to contact
a wireless carrier...

20:02.661 --> 20:05.163
and have them find out who made
that last phone call to me.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.207
<i>- Jack, I could be more helpful if...
- Just do it.</i>

20:07.666 --> 20:08.792
Just do it. I need it, all right?

20:08.876 --> 20:10.878
<i>And call me when you get it.</i>

20:11.962 --> 20:16.800
John Forster was an Eagle Scout, which
counts for his facility with ropes.

20:17.009 --> 20:19.219
He also worked
in a veterinary office...

20:19.428 --> 20:22.598
where he had experience using
the animal tranquilizer Halothane...

20:22.806 --> 20:24.349
witch he's used to subdue
his victims.

20:24.433 --> 20:29.104
Halothane. Sorry, I'm late again.
Thank you, Kim.

20:29.855 --> 20:33.942
I see that the size of our class
is dwindling once again.

20:34.026 --> 20:36.236
It could be because
you keep booting everyone.

20:36.486 --> 20:39.364
My favorite student, Mike Stempt.

20:41.491 --> 20:46.872
Okay. The legal distinction between
sanity and insanity rests upon what?

20:47.122 --> 20:50.209
- Free will.
- The concept of the free will.

20:50.501 --> 20:53.462
And what is
the most important thing...

20:53.629 --> 20:55.964
one should remember
when entering a court-room?

20:56.215 --> 21:00.177
That insanity it's a legal concept.
It's not a medical or psychiatric term.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.429
But despite the fact that insanity
is a legal concept...

21:02.513 --> 21:04.139
it doesn't mean
that someone is not sick.

21:04.181 --> 21:05.182
Yes, Lauren.

21:05.641 --> 21:08.519
Of all the serial killers
that I've interviewed and studied...

21:08.602 --> 21:12.648
witch include our boy Bundy,
Dahmer, Gacy...

21:12.689 --> 21:15.150
none of them was legally insane.

21:15.526 --> 21:17.277
This is not saying
that they were normal.

21:17.486 --> 21:19.196
I could argue that
they couldn't help themselves...

21:19.279 --> 21:20.822
precisely because of
their mental disorder.

21:20.864 --> 21:23.158
Well, if you wanna argue, Mike...

21:23.367 --> 21:25.160
school of law is across campus.

21:25.244 --> 21:26.787
Come on, Dr. Gramm.

21:26.995 --> 21:30.165
It's ingenuous to pretend that
our presentations are not arguments.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.543
We create a narrative of the crime
and the criminal.

21:32.626 --> 21:35.379
Narrative is based on facts.
Based on logic.

21:35.629 --> 21:38.757
We don't walk into a court-room
and advocate set scenes, do we?

21:39.216 --> 21:43.178
We don't take sides.
We check our views at the door.

21:43.554 --> 21:45.722
You mean you want us to pretend
we don't have an opinion?

21:45.806 --> 21:48.517
We have opinions, Lauren,
but we just keep them to ourselves.

21:48.725 --> 21:50.894
Share them with your dog,
if you have to.

21:51.103 --> 21:53.397
Not with your parrot,
because it talks back.

21:54.231 --> 21:57.401
It is that kind of logic that's gonna
get you in a law school across campus.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.777
I've been there. I've done that.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.988
Well, my condolences.

22:02.322 --> 22:04.241
So, where is...

22:04.491 --> 22:07.578
Dale Morris? She's absent.
I don't see her.

22:10.372 --> 22:11.999
That's her first.

22:15.961 --> 22:17.421
I didn't take her for a quitter.

22:19.173 --> 22:23.343
Anyone who has her phone number,
please, contact me after class.

22:27.306 --> 22:28.849
Okay.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.101
Excuse me.

22:33.937 --> 22:34.688
Shelley.

22:34.771 --> 22:39.026
<i>Tick-Tack, doc.
You have 83 minutes to live, Dr. Gramm.</i>

22:40.444 --> 22:42.070
<i>Tick-Tack, doc.</i>

22:53.457 --> 22:55.375
So where was I?

22:55.584 --> 22:57.419
Bundy versus Forster.

22:57.628 --> 22:59.838
- What?
- Bundy versus Forster.

23:01.006 --> 23:02.216
Thank you, Lauren.

23:05.594 --> 23:06.553
You're welcome.

23:09.306 --> 23:13.936
What we're gonna explore today is
the similarities and dissimilarities...

23:14.144 --> 23:19.358
say, from Ted Bundy's motives,
let's compared them to John Forster's.

23:25.239 --> 23:27.282
Dr. Gramm,
your phone is ringing.

23:34.665 --> 23:37.125
<i>- Jack, are you there?
- Shelley. What's going on?</i>

23:37.167 --> 23:38.919
The call was made
from a cell phone.

23:39.002 --> 23:41.088
One of those you buy
and pay minutes for it.

23:41.380 --> 23:42.297
Registered to whom?

23:42.589 --> 23:45.425
- Look, I know you're in class, but...
- Yes, who is registered to it?

23:47.845 --> 23:48.720
A Kate Gramm.

23:53.183 --> 23:56.061
Jack, it's a common name.
It doesn't have to be your sister.

23:56.144 --> 23:57.104
It's just a coincidence.

23:59.273 --> 24:00.440
It's not a coincidence.

24:03.527 --> 24:06.405
- It's not a coincidence.
- Jack, I'm loosing you.

24:06.655 --> 24:08.282
Shelley?
Goddamn it!

24:08.907 --> 24:09.783
Shelley?

24:09.867 --> 24:12.744
<i>Have you found out who my phone
is registered to by now?</i>

24:13.036 --> 24:16.498
<i>Poor Kate. If it was Kate,
you'd like to call her?</i>

24:16.707 --> 24:19.126
I'm gonna find you, you here that,
you son-of-a-bitch?

24:19.376 --> 24:21.837
You're barking up the wrong tree
on this one.

24:22.045 --> 24:23.422
I'm gonna find you.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.757
<i>She suffered
for such a long time.</i>

24:26.633 --> 24:28.510
<i>You remember how long,
don't you?</i>

24:29.178 --> 24:31.013
<i>You still feel guilty about her?</i>

24:31.722 --> 24:34.725
<i>You feel guilty about
falsifying the evidence?</i>

24:34.766 --> 24:36.977
<i>For lying under oath?</i>

24:37.186 --> 24:40.772
<i>Tic-tac, doc.
You have 79 minutes to live.</i>

25:11.929 --> 25:13.931
Do you find this funny, Albert?

25:14.097 --> 25:15.933
Who were you calling on
your phone?

25:17.434 --> 25:18.894
Let me see your phone.

25:19.269 --> 25:20.604
I was just...

25:20.854 --> 25:22.231
Let me see that goddamn it phone.

25:22.272 --> 25:23.732
I was just checking
the Mariners score.

25:23.774 --> 25:25.901
- You were what?
- I was checking the Mariners score.

25:26.151 --> 25:27.819
Okay, what is the score?

25:29.404 --> 25:30.405
The score.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.366
What's the damn score?

25:34.368 --> 25:36.870
It's 3 x 1 Mariners.
B1.

26:10.821 --> 26:13.574
- Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
- What does it mean? What's the problem?

26:13.657 --> 26:14.992
Look.

26:15.075 --> 26:15.951
What?

26:16.785 --> 26:17.870
What's going on here?

26:17.953 --> 26:20.831
It says that Dale Morris was murdered
last night.

26:21.415 --> 26:24.126
- Is that true, Dr. Gramm?
- Yeah.

26:24.418 --> 26:27.462
You knew it?
You knew it and you didn't tell us?

26:27.671 --> 26:30.716
- You knew and asked for Dale's number?
- Is it the slayer?

26:30.966 --> 26:32.843
- It could be.
- It could be?

26:33.093 --> 26:35.220
Well, the police haven't released
any information yet.

26:35.470 --> 26:37.848
- Are we all in danger?
- I can't believe you didn't tell us.

26:38.056 --> 26:40.517
- Dr. Gramm?
- Lynn Johnson.

26:40.684 --> 26:42.311
Someone just called
a bomb threat.

26:42.519 --> 26:45.647
Everyone is to evacuate the building
immediately. Thank you.

26:45.731 --> 26:47.900
Come on.
Grab your stuff.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.736
I'll get your papers
of presentation, Tom.

26:50.944 --> 26:52.654
I got the slides, Kim.

26:56.325 --> 27:00.746
<i>All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.</i>

27:00.829 --> 27:04.041
<i>I repeat.
Everyone must evacuate the building.</i>

27:12.966 --> 27:17.304
<i>All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.</i>

27:17.554 --> 27:20.724
<i>I repeat.
Everyone must evacuate the building.</i>

27:24.186 --> 27:27.064
<i>Please,
remain calm e do not run.</i>

27:27.147 --> 27:30.067
<i>Proceed to the door
to the end of the campus.</i>

27:30.567 --> 27:33.737
<i>I repeat.
We must evacuate the building.</i>

27:34.863 --> 27:37.699
Jack? What are you doing?
Get going.

27:39.243 --> 27:44.248
<i>All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.</i>

27:45.123 --> 27:47.167
What was that on the screen?

27:47.751 --> 27:51.588
Some student playing a joke
or something.

27:52.089 --> 27:55.384
You of all people know that it breaks
school laws to proceed by a threat...

27:55.425 --> 27:58.554
you need to report this
to the campus security immediately.

27:58.720 --> 28:02.599
Carol. I get threat like this,
three or four times a year.

28:02.683 --> 28:05.644
Your incredible arrogance
will slap the shit of you, Jack.

28:05.811 --> 28:08.230
I wish you'd disclosure
your true feelings about me...

28:08.272 --> 28:09.648
before we became
such good friends.

28:09.857 --> 28:12.401
Maybe you should stop hiding behind
your assessments about other people...

28:12.484 --> 28:13.527
and start assessing yourself...

28:13.610 --> 28:15.571
cause you need to get over your past
and go on with your life...

28:15.612 --> 28:17.531
cause what you're living
isn't one.

28:17.698 --> 28:19.825
It is not what you tell
your patients?

28:21.034 --> 28:22.953
- Gum?
- Thank you.

28:23.287 --> 28:25.622
I'll call campus security and let
them know you're on your way.

28:25.706 --> 28:28.125
Where did you go last night?
When you left the bar.

28:30.711 --> 28:31.753
Home.

28:32.171 --> 28:33.881
Were you alone?

28:34.673 --> 28:36.592
Screw you.

28:55.110 --> 28:56.653
Roger.
We're on it.

29:07.456 --> 29:08.040
Yeah.

29:08.290 --> 29:10.751
The press got a hold of Dale's name.
It's all over the news.

29:11.293 --> 29:12.836
Yeah, I know that.

29:14.087 --> 29:17.591
<i>And Forster's attorney is going
to the court and try a stay.</i>

29:18.008 --> 29:20.052
A stay?
On what grounds?

29:20.344 --> 29:21.678
They're claiming that these...

29:21.762 --> 29:24.306
murders prove that the real killer
have never been brought to justice.

29:24.556 --> 29:27.601
Nonsense. They're just trying
to buy time. They're desperate.

29:27.851 --> 29:31.355
They're also claiming that you falsify
testimony and concealed evidences.

29:31.563 --> 29:33.982
Well, it's all loose.
Goddamn it.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.777
Who is that guy?

29:39.905 --> 29:43.325
What about Dale Morris?
Did we find anymore of her?

29:43.492 --> 29:46.870
She was murdered
in her apartment...

29:46.954 --> 29:48.830
between the hours of two
and six am.

29:49.039 --> 29:50.541
<i>- Any sign of force entry?
- No.</i>

29:50.874 --> 29:54.503
Does Forster still have that group
visiting him on prison?

29:55.128 --> 29:57.548
He's like a goddamn rock star.
Website and all.

29:57.798 --> 30:00.676
I want you to pull a background check
on all my students...

30:00.884 --> 30:02.427
and get back to me.

30:04.263 --> 30:05.013
Damn.

30:08.767 --> 30:09.768
Oh, no.

30:52.936 --> 30:54.271
Okay.

31:52.454 --> 31:54.790
Kim?
What are you doing here?

31:54.873 --> 31:56.625
I'm getting my car,
it's parked here...

31:56.708 --> 31:58.919
like it's every day
I come to the campus.

32:00.003 --> 32:04.132
That was really horrible.
Just horrible what you did in class...

32:04.216 --> 32:06.468
- it's was little low for you.
- I was looking for potential suspects.

32:06.677 --> 32:09.805
That's what I was doing. What did you do
after you left the party last night?

32:10.013 --> 32:12.933
I didn't end up drunk in bed
with an strange like you.

32:13.183 --> 32:17.020
You left the party with Dale Morris,
the girl that was murdered, didn't you?

32:18.021 --> 32:21.066
- Yes, I did.
- So what did you do? Where did you go?

32:21.942 --> 32:24.486
You're not seriously
considering...

32:25.821 --> 32:26.780
Where did you go?

32:27.030 --> 32:29.616
We went to the Hickory Stick.
We had a drink, two drinks.

32:30.158 --> 32:32.619
- And then?
- And then I went home alone.

32:33.495 --> 32:36.957
- You have anyone that can verify that?
- No. No-one can verify it.

32:37.124 --> 32:38.584
Come on. I've been your
teaching assistant for two years.

32:38.667 --> 32:41.628
I'm your friend.
I'm here to help you, if you let me.

32:41.712 --> 32:43.172
Follow me.

32:46.258 --> 32:47.968
Follow me.

32:51.763 --> 32:53.223
Who did that?

32:54.516 --> 32:55.893
What does that mean?

32:55.976 --> 32:57.978
According to a anonymous
phone call...

32:58.061 --> 33:01.106
that means I have
72 minutes left to live.

33:01.315 --> 33:03.483
Can I borrow your cell phone?

33:03.692 --> 33:05.152
I've broke mine.

33:06.278 --> 33:07.362
These are my car keys.

33:07.446 --> 33:09.907
Can you take that around front
and meet me there in ten minutes?

33:09.990 --> 33:13.160
- I have to go to the campus security.
- Okay.

33:13.243 --> 33:15.037
Call me on my Blackberry
if you run late.

33:15.579 --> 33:16.496
Okay.

33:18.248 --> 33:21.710
Shelley. You gonna have to reach me
on Kim's cell phone.

33:21.919 --> 33:22.753
What happened to yours?

33:22.836 --> 33:24.630
<i>- I broke it.
- What?</i>

33:24.796 --> 33:26.048
<i>You have her number, don't you?</i>

33:26.423 --> 33:27.174
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

33:27.257 --> 33:32.179
Listen, just forward all the calls,
okay, to Kim's cell.

33:33.096 --> 33:34.389
Please, thanks.

33:34.681 --> 33:36.141
Dr. Gramm.

33:36.725 --> 33:37.559
Hey, Mike.

33:39.603 --> 33:42.231
Everyone is pretty upset
about Dale.

33:42.397 --> 33:46.276
Yeah, well, that's understandable.
Considering the circumstances.

33:46.735 --> 33:48.570
I have a question about
John Forster.

33:48.862 --> 33:50.572
Yeah? What?

33:51.240 --> 33:54.952
Well, I've been going through the trial
transcripts in Kate's history...

33:55.160 --> 33:56.620
Why would you do that?

33:56.703 --> 34:00.499
To understand your process better.
How you come to your conclusions.

34:01.583 --> 34:02.543
And?

34:03.293 --> 34:04.545
What?

34:05.796 --> 34:08.465
Is it possible that Forster
is innocent?

34:08.549 --> 34:09.466
No.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.885
You won't even consider
the possibility?

34:11.969 --> 34:12.928
No.

34:13.136 --> 34:16.889
You're completely convinced the scenario
you put together is the only one?

34:17.056 --> 34:19.643
First of all,
I didn't put together a scenario.

34:20.101 --> 34:22.437
I recreated the crime scene.
Second...

34:22.646 --> 34:24.815
I didn't convict Forster.
A jury did.

34:24.898 --> 34:26.483
But the evidence
was circumstantial.

34:26.567 --> 34:28.360
No DNA, no murder weapon.

34:28.527 --> 34:32.030
Nothing directly linking Forster
to the crime, except your narrative...

34:32.197 --> 34:34.783
- and Janie Kay's testimony.
- What's your point?

34:35.409 --> 34:37.369
Just that your testimony
was very convincing.

34:37.661 --> 34:39.288
That's my job.

34:39.329 --> 34:41.039
To be convincing.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.335
I thought it was to be right.

34:58.098 --> 34:59.641
<i>Help!</i>

35:01.268 --> 35:03.270
<i>Somebody, please!</i>

35:07.357 --> 35:08.483
<i>Help!</i>

35:08.734 --> 35:10.027
<i>Help!</i>

35:14.406 --> 35:15.490
- Lauren.
- Dr. Gramm.

35:15.532 --> 35:16.491
What happened to you?

35:16.533 --> 35:18.327
He's wearing a leather jacket.
He's out there.

35:18.535 --> 35:21.538
I bit his hand, it's bleeding.
If his hand is bloody, you can get him.

35:21.622 --> 35:24.875
- You're okay?
- Go get him now! I'm fine!

35:56.907 --> 35:59.201
- Watch my car!
- It's a police action!

35:59.451 --> 36:00.369
There's been an assault.

36:00.410 --> 36:02.037
- I wanna see your hands.
- Back off!

36:02.246 --> 36:03.789
- Roll the window down.
- No!

36:03.956 --> 36:07.209
I'm a forensic psychiatric
with the FBI. Here.

36:07.459 --> 36:09.002
Okay?
Open the window now.

36:09.294 --> 36:11.672
- Yeah.
- See? Well, roll down the window...

36:11.880 --> 36:14.675
and let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands.

36:14.883 --> 36:17.219
If you have nothing to hide,
you can show me.

36:17.261 --> 36:19.304
Look, I'm trying to go home.
What?

36:20.430 --> 36:22.099
Okay, sorry.

36:28.689 --> 36:29.857
Excuse me.

36:29.940 --> 36:32.401
There's been an assault.
I wanna see your hand.

36:39.658 --> 36:41.535
Okay. Be cool now!

36:42.870 --> 36:44.872
There's been an assault.
I gotta check your hands.

36:45.122 --> 36:47.958
I'm a forensic psychiatric
with the FBI.

37:04.349 --> 37:05.767
Sorry.

37:14.985 --> 37:15.986
I couldn't find him.

37:16.778 --> 37:17.946
Here.

37:19.031 --> 37:20.782
This is stupid.

37:21.575 --> 37:22.659
I'm so stupid.

37:22.743 --> 37:25.954
- How I could be so weak? Such a wimp.
- It's not your fault. Come on.

37:26.038 --> 37:28.957
I can't believe I let him get away
like that. I should've fought back more.

37:29.041 --> 37:31.293
Stop beating yourself up?
What exactly happened?

37:31.502 --> 37:34.796
He came from behind. He put this rag
over my mouth and I bit his hand.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.674
- The rag had an odor?
- Something sweet...

37:38.842 --> 37:40.135
It's Halothane, right?

37:40.719 --> 37:42.471
- Yeah.
- He's the one.

37:43.138 --> 37:44.097
Probably.

37:44.389 --> 37:45.933
I let Dale's murderer get away.

37:46.016 --> 37:48.435
Stop beating yourself up
and tell me something.

37:48.519 --> 37:51.271
Tell me something. Could you
identify him if you saw him again?

37:51.730 --> 37:54.149
He came from behind,
I didn't see him.

37:57.027 --> 37:59.446
Let's go to the campus security,
you'll tell the everything.

38:07.788 --> 38:08.997
Hello.

38:09.331 --> 38:11.291
This woman has just been attacked.

38:11.542 --> 38:13.043
Are you okay?

38:13.252 --> 38:14.378
I think so.

38:14.586 --> 38:15.921
What's your name?

38:17.089 --> 38:18.632
Lauren Douglas.

38:19.174 --> 38:20.342
And who are you?

38:20.551 --> 38:21.885
Jack Gramm.

38:22.427 --> 38:24.388
The famous Dr. Jack Gramm?

38:24.680 --> 38:26.390
Then Johnson Fonsen
have you be coming in.

38:26.473 --> 38:29.601
Is there someone to interview
Miss Douglas now, please?

38:30.394 --> 38:31.478
- Jimmy?
- Yeah.

38:31.562 --> 38:33.772
- You wanna check out this girl?
- Wait a minute.

38:34.189 --> 38:35.440
Right this way.

38:41.238 --> 38:42.865
What's going on here?

38:43.198 --> 38:45.450
The person who attacked her
may still be on the campus.

38:45.534 --> 38:46.493
What the hell you guys doing?

38:46.577 --> 38:49.162
We got all these guys out
on the bomb squad.

38:49.329 --> 38:51.790
Excuse me for one moment.
It's a little crazy around here.

38:51.957 --> 38:54.585
Jimmy, get off the phone
and interview Miss. Douglas, please.

38:54.835 --> 38:56.128
I'll be right there.

38:59.256 --> 39:00.507
Why won't you seat here?

39:03.927 --> 39:05.804
Okay, you okay?

39:08.765 --> 39:10.893
<i>- Jack Gramm Associates.
- Shelley? Get Frank...</i>

39:10.934 --> 39:12.728
<i>- and pass him through when you get him.
- Okay.</i>

39:12.769 --> 39:13.729
Okay, thank you.

39:14.771 --> 39:18.317
I don't want you going back to your
apartment until the locks are changed.

39:18.942 --> 39:20.444
I don't have anywhere else to go.

39:22.446 --> 39:24.740
After you talk
to the officer here...

39:25.199 --> 39:28.410
go back to my office.
Shelley will find a place to stay.

39:28.452 --> 39:29.286
Okay.

39:29.494 --> 39:32.998
- Come on. It's gonna be all right.
- Sorry for all the troubles I caused.

39:36.793 --> 39:38.587
Miss. Douglas. Right this way.

39:39.630 --> 39:41.798
- Right in here.
- I'm sorry.

39:43.634 --> 39:46.386
- Yeah?
- I left a word for Frank.

39:46.595 --> 39:49.014
<i>Okay.
There's been another incident.</i>

39:49.264 --> 39:51.558
The Forster's case it's your thing,
right?

39:51.808 --> 39:53.227
Wrong, it's not my thing.

39:53.685 --> 39:56.271
I saw your testimony
on Court TV.

39:56.313 --> 39:57.356
Yeah, right?

39:57.981 --> 39:58.941
Fill those out.

40:00.776 --> 40:03.612
Yeah, I follow
the big crime cases.

40:03.820 --> 40:04.905
They fascinate me.

40:05.364 --> 40:08.075
When Dr. Jack Gramm
takes the stand.

40:09.076 --> 40:10.744
You come up with things
I didn't think off.

40:14.164 --> 40:18.126
- This here, this is just a job until...
- Until you pass the police's exam.

40:18.377 --> 40:20.295
See? How did you know that?

40:20.629 --> 40:21.797
Just a guess.

40:22.005 --> 40:23.298
That's the thing about you.

40:23.549 --> 40:25.592
You know how to put two plus two
and you make it four.

40:26.176 --> 40:27.094
Or five.

40:27.678 --> 40:29.471
There are times that you know.

40:29.680 --> 40:32.975
I'm not gonna be a campus cop
to a bunch of snob rich kids.

40:33.183 --> 40:34.309
Especially these rich bitches...

40:34.393 --> 40:38.480
My car is been analyzed.
The window was smashed.

40:38.814 --> 40:41.650
There's a number on the body.
Look into it.

40:42.276 --> 40:43.569
Dr. Gramm?

40:46.905 --> 40:48.407
Dr. Gramm?

40:52.703 --> 40:55.122
This is Johnny D'Franco,
from campus security.

40:55.289 --> 40:57.457
Can you get me Lynn Johnson?

40:58.041 --> 41:00.085
<i>- Jack Gramm Associates.
- Shelley?</i>

41:00.210 --> 41:03.005
<i>- Did you find Frank?
- No, not yet. What the hell is going on?</i>

41:03.255 --> 41:08.177
Well, I received a threaten phone call
saying I have 88 minutes to live.

41:08.802 --> 41:11.305
<i>11:45h this morning,
and my time is up.</i>

41:11.597 --> 41:13.724
Pull out my risk assessment file.

41:13.932 --> 41:16.143
Anybody rating "e" and above...

41:16.310 --> 41:18.687
<i>I want you to cross reference
against Forster.</i>

41:19.438 --> 41:21.064
<i>And when you find Frank...</i>

41:21.273 --> 41:25.652
ask him if Sara Pollard or any of my
students ever visit Forster in prison.

41:26.028 --> 41:27.821
Sara Pollard?

41:28.030 --> 41:30.782
<i>She's the girl I met at the party
last night.</i>

41:32.159 --> 41:33.493
<i>Call Wong Lee...</i>

41:33.577 --> 41:35.954
<i>and have him make a list
of all the phone numbers...</i>

41:36.246 --> 41:37.998
Forster called
on the last 72 hours.

41:38.332 --> 41:39.708
Where should fax the list?

41:40.626 --> 41:41.543
My apartment.

41:41.752 --> 41:43.879
And run a check on Kim.

41:45.714 --> 41:46.215
Kim?

41:47.549 --> 41:50.093
Yeah, just do it, okay?
Hello.

41:50.761 --> 41:51.303
Jack.

41:52.346 --> 41:54.389
- Damn it.
- The car is out front.

41:54.473 --> 41:56.225
- Drive Squaid.
- Good.

41:56.433 --> 41:57.851
You're okay?
You look a little freaked out.

41:57.935 --> 41:58.852
Yeah. You have...

41:59.061 --> 42:00.896
- a battery for your phone?
- Yeah, I do.

42:05.108 --> 42:06.902
- What the hell is this?
- What are you doing?

42:07.110 --> 42:09.279
Goddamn it, what is this?

42:09.530 --> 42:10.739
What are you doing with a gun
in your purse?

42:10.822 --> 42:12.449
Jesus, why don't you just announce
to the world?

42:12.658 --> 42:14.701
I don't think they've heard you
in English Department.

42:14.910 --> 42:16.662
- Why the gun, Kim?
- For protection.

42:17.287 --> 42:19.915
- Where did you get it?
- I have a permit. My dad is a cop.

42:20.457 --> 42:23.335
- Why you need a gun?
- I don't. My dad thinks I do.

42:23.502 --> 42:24.711
Why?

42:24.795 --> 42:27.089
I have a crazy ex boyfriend,
okay, Jack?

42:27.172 --> 42:28.465
Oh. Jesus. God.

42:28.715 --> 42:31.426
Yeah, I really know how to pick one
or what?

42:31.468 --> 42:33.720
The judge said if he threats anyone
he goes back to jail.

42:33.804 --> 42:36.139
Back to jail? What jail?

42:36.390 --> 42:39.142
Prison, actually.
Walla Walla.

42:41.854 --> 42:43.605
That's where Forster is.

42:45.941 --> 42:46.859
Come on, let's go.

42:47.651 --> 42:49.528
Special Agent Parks.

42:49.695 --> 42:50.821
<i>Frank, it's Jack.</i>

42:50.946 --> 42:54.366
I'm at the university campus.
We got a problem here.

42:54.449 --> 42:57.911
Someone attacked one of my students and
tried to knock her out with Halothane.

42:58.161 --> 43:01.582
<i>- That's the Seattle slayer.
- I know, hold on.</i>

43:01.832 --> 43:03.125
Give me a second.

43:04.251 --> 43:08.755
Yeah. There's a security guard
on this campus, his name is D'Franco.

43:08.964 --> 43:10.924
I don't like him.
He's suspicious.

43:11.175 --> 43:13.135
I want you to take him in
for questioning, okay?

43:13.343 --> 43:15.971
Also get a warrant
and search his place.

43:16.054 --> 43:17.139
Jesus Christ, Jack.

43:17.222 --> 43:19.975
You know I can't just get a warrant
without sufficient grounds.

43:20.184 --> 43:22.186
Just get a warrant, Frank,
come on.

43:22.269 --> 43:23.979
<i>Do you think he is the slayer?</i>

43:24.479 --> 43:27.441
<i>- To link Forster on the outside?
- It's possible.</i>

43:27.691 --> 43:31.486
Listen, I checked the names
that Shelley, of the students.

43:31.778 --> 43:35.490
And there's no record of Lauren Douglas,
Kim Cummings or Sara Pollard...

43:35.699 --> 43:36.617
but you gonna love this.

43:36.867 --> 43:41.496
<i>Mike Stempt visit Forster four times
over the last six weeks.</i>

43:41.997 --> 43:43.832
Mike Stempt. What was his reason?

43:44.249 --> 43:46.251
<i>Research.
He had written permission.</i>

43:46.460 --> 43:48.504
<i>No, no, no.
I didn't give him any permission.</i>

43:48.754 --> 43:50.172
Written or otherwise.

43:50.422 --> 43:53.592
Well, it's your signature, Jack.
I got a copy right here.

43:54.843 --> 43:56.386
Hold on.
That... Hold on a second.

43:56.637 --> 43:58.722
That ex boyfriend of yours.
What is his name?

43:58.931 --> 44:00.349
Guy LaForge.

44:00.599 --> 44:03.268
Run a check on a parole
named Guy LaForge.

44:03.477 --> 44:06.271
He served time at Walla Walla
with Forster.

44:06.605 --> 44:09.107
And I'll call you back
when I get to my apartment.

44:09.441 --> 44:10.859
All right.

44:12.528 --> 44:14.112
Do you think that Frank is working
with Forster?

44:14.321 --> 44:15.614
<i>Someone is.</i>

44:15.781 --> 44:17.699
- I got you Johnson.
- Yeah.

44:18.408 --> 44:20.327
They've found a backpack
in your lecture hall.

44:20.702 --> 44:22.204
What? With a bomb in it?

44:22.663 --> 44:26.542
No. A photo, dynamite,
and a time with a note addressed to you.

44:26.750 --> 44:27.668
What did it say?

44:27.876 --> 44:29.086
Tic-tac.

44:30.754 --> 44:31.797
What does it mean, Jack?

44:32.089 --> 44:33.674
I call you back.

44:58.574 --> 45:00.242
- You are okay?
- Yeah.

45:00.492 --> 45:02.244
What the hell was that?

45:03.787 --> 45:05.956
Probably somebody
trying to scare us.

45:06.123 --> 45:08.584
Who do you think would do
something like that?

45:09.543 --> 45:12.045
Does your boyfriend drive
a motorcycle?

45:12.296 --> 45:13.589
Yeah.

45:13.797 --> 45:16.383
Except he's not my boyfriend
anymore.

45:17.134 --> 45:17.885
Yeah.

45:18.135 --> 45:20.971
<i>How does it feel to know
you won't live through another night?</i>

45:21.138 --> 45:22.306
<i>56 minutes.</i>

45:23.056 --> 45:24.600
<i>Tic-tac, doc.</i>

45:26.351 --> 45:27.561
Let's go.

46:15.442 --> 46:17.027
Guy LaForge.

46:17.486 --> 46:19.363
He isn't a boyfriend, is he?

46:21.365 --> 46:24.868
The only thing that got me out of Texas
was my books marks.

46:25.994 --> 46:29.414
And when I left for college,
I had that, but not much else.

46:29.498 --> 46:33.001
So I tried to fit in.
I drank too much.

46:34.711 --> 46:36.255
Thought too little.

46:36.922 --> 46:38.674
And I met Guy.

46:42.219 --> 46:44.221
And he was this English...

46:44.763 --> 46:47.349
working class rock star
wanna be.

46:47.432 --> 46:49.309
And I fell for him.

46:50.561 --> 46:52.396
And I married him...

46:52.479 --> 46:54.064
when I graduated.

46:55.566 --> 46:59.695
He didn't take to well to my aspirations
for higher education.

47:00.153 --> 47:03.782
In fact he didn't really want me to
leave the house. And when I disobeyed...

47:03.991 --> 47:06.910
he got filthy drunk
and he beat me.

47:07.411 --> 47:09.746
That's when he got arrested
and I divorced him.

47:09.997 --> 47:13.000
I've been trying to make up
for lost time ever since.

47:18.422 --> 47:21.550
- You know, Forster is trying to kill me.
- Forster is in prison.

47:21.842 --> 47:24.511
Yeah, I know. He's got someone
on the outside trying to...

47:25.470 --> 47:27.097
to do the job.

47:30.225 --> 47:31.768
He's gonna kill me.

47:33.353 --> 47:35.272
If I don't get him first.

47:40.861 --> 47:43.405
Whoever is working with Forster
must be close to you.

47:43.572 --> 47:46.950
- A friend even.
- I don't have many friends.

47:47.159 --> 47:48.243
That's a plus.

47:48.327 --> 47:51.580
It's a real pleasure to look at everyone
you know as your would be murderer.

47:51.788 --> 47:54.249
Paranoia is a normal state of mind,
huh?

47:55.918 --> 47:57.002
Where is Errol?

47:57.085 --> 47:59.963
I don't know. I'm a temp.
The agency sent me.

48:00.589 --> 48:02.090
Dr. Gramm?

48:02.549 --> 48:04.301
There's a package for you.

48:07.804 --> 48:09.306
How did you know my name?

48:09.473 --> 48:12.017
I don't.
It was a question.

48:13.644 --> 48:14.811
Yeah.

48:15.687 --> 48:18.106
- There's no returning address on this?
- No.

48:19.691 --> 48:21.109
Who delivered it?

48:21.318 --> 48:24.446
A carrier. But there was
another person here at the same time...

48:24.613 --> 48:26.782
- Iooking for you.
- Who?

48:27.032 --> 48:29.284
- What was his name?
- No, I didn't get it.

48:29.451 --> 48:31.828
When he walked in I was on the phone
with the plumber.

48:31.912 --> 48:37.167
- He said he would be right back.
- Okay.

48:37.251 --> 48:38.836
You wanna me pull
the surveillance tapes?

48:38.919 --> 48:41.421
That shouldn't take more than an hour
to get someone up here with the keys.

48:43.674 --> 48:45.384
- I don't have an hour.
- No?

48:45.634 --> 48:50.430
Hey, you know, he was also wearing
leathers. He had a motorcycle helmet.

48:50.639 --> 48:52.808
That's Guy. He was here.

48:54.434 --> 48:57.521
If he comes back,
don't send him up to my apartment.

48:58.188 --> 48:59.439
Yeah.

49:00.315 --> 49:02.192
- Hi, Dr. Gramm.
- Hi, Eva.

49:11.159 --> 49:13.328
How did Guy know
we're going to be here?

49:13.537 --> 49:15.330
How does even know
where you live?

49:15.622 --> 49:17.499
Oh, Walther P99.

49:17.708 --> 49:19.877
That would blow a hole
through anything.

49:21.587 --> 49:23.839
What?
I grew up around guns.

49:24.089 --> 49:27.342
Maybe he didn't know I was gonna
be here, maybe that's why he showed up.

49:28.218 --> 49:31.305
I'll verify where he went after
the party last night.

49:32.556 --> 49:35.225
<i>There's a Lauren Douglas to see you.
Should I send her up?</i>

49:35.893 --> 49:37.269
Okay, send her up.

49:40.355 --> 49:42.316
He got that right, didn't he?

49:42.649 --> 49:44.109
Hey, what's that?

49:44.776 --> 49:46.028
This?

49:46.570 --> 49:48.322
It's a chemical detector.

49:48.989 --> 49:52.993
It sniffs out vapors.
Custom agencies are using it.

49:53.744 --> 49:54.995
And?

50:00.584 --> 50:02.044
It's not a bomb.

50:02.503 --> 50:03.504
That's good.

50:04.254 --> 50:05.380
Yeah.

50:17.559 --> 50:19.061
- Hi.
- Hi.

50:19.144 --> 50:22.064
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm better, thank you.

50:24.608 --> 50:27.444
- What do you have?
- I went to see Shelley like you said.

50:27.528 --> 50:30.489
She tried to fax you over some papers,
but the machine was down.

50:30.864 --> 50:34.201
So I said I'd bring the risk assessment
profiles over myself.

50:35.118 --> 50:37.663
I didn't know you had company.

50:38.038 --> 50:41.250
Dale told me how good you're with her
when her dad died.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.794
She was so grateful.

50:45.212 --> 50:46.797
Dr. Gramm?

50:46.964 --> 50:48.006
Yeah?

50:48.215 --> 50:50.801
If there's anything I can do
to help you find Dale's murderer...

50:50.884 --> 50:53.470
- will you let me know?
- Of course, yes.

50:54.596 --> 50:55.806
Thank you.

50:56.974 --> 50:59.560
Can I call you a cab
or something?

50:59.977 --> 51:02.354
No, Mike is gonna give me
a ride.

51:02.646 --> 51:03.856
- Okay.
- Thanks for these...

51:04.189 --> 51:05.315
Bye.

51:09.528 --> 51:11.864
All those people
have threatened you?

51:12.030 --> 51:14.825
Well, you know,
it comes with the territory.

51:15.450 --> 51:17.744
How come you never mention that
in class?

51:18.996 --> 51:22.666
How many students end up going
into this field anyway?

51:23.166 --> 51:26.587
Not very many
with you booting all of them.

51:27.671 --> 51:28.505
Yeah.

51:37.181 --> 51:39.266
Can I ask you
a personal question?

51:39.474 --> 51:40.642
No.

51:41.852 --> 51:43.270
How come you never
got married?

51:43.770 --> 51:45.814
I mean,
you're a pretty good prospect.

51:46.607 --> 51:48.483
You obviously make a shit load
of money.

51:48.567 --> 51:49.651
Why would I get married?

51:49.902 --> 51:52.112
I'm a target for any nut
with a grudge.

51:54.406 --> 51:56.658
I can't afford emotional
attachments.

51:56.909 --> 51:58.243
Yeah, but don't you want kids?

51:58.702 --> 52:00.204
Don't you want a family?

52:00.454 --> 52:02.039
I'm too old for kids.

52:05.209 --> 52:07.586
You're too young for me, Kim.

52:10.714 --> 52:14.593
If you want me to leave, Jack, all
you've got to do is say it and I'm gone.

52:14.885 --> 52:16.803
No, I don't want you to leave.

52:17.221 --> 52:18.680
I need you, Kim.

52:18.764 --> 52:20.891
You are smart
and you are important to me.

52:20.974 --> 52:22.809
Really, you are.

52:25.479 --> 52:26.688
Okay.

52:45.374 --> 52:47.376
<i>- Yeah.
- Jack, it's Shelley.</i>

52:47.417 --> 52:48.919
What the hell happened to you?
Where have you been

52:49.127 --> 52:52.172
Making calls for you, four lines
simultaneously. The fax is down.

52:52.214 --> 52:54.591
<i>I know, Lauren Douglas came over
and brought some papers with her.</i>

52:54.675 --> 52:56.510
Jack, you better turn on MS-NBC.

52:56.677 --> 52:57.427
Why?

52:57.511 --> 53:00.180
Forster got a judge to grant
his request for an interview.

53:00.347 --> 53:01.306
<i>He's on, live.</i>

53:01.515 --> 53:04.059
<i>This is gonna heat things up</i>

53:03.700 --> 53:04.784
<i>When looking for a home...</i>

53:04.868 --> 53:07.245
<i>a real estate agent is really important
in you life. You need someone...</i>

53:09.242 --> 53:10.660
Shelley. Listen to me.

53:10.869 --> 53:14.164
I want you to send some of the boys
to my apartment, all right?

53:14.372 --> 53:17.917
There may be someone down at my lobby
in biker leathers when they get there.

53:18.001 --> 53:18.960
Okay?

53:19.627 --> 53:22.422
<i>- You got a name?
- Yes, his name is Guy LaForge.</i>

53:22.797 --> 53:27.177
Put a photo
on the FBI wire, okay?

53:27.427 --> 53:29.554
<i>If you are not granted
another stay of the execution...</i>

53:29.804 --> 53:31.139
<i>are you prepared to die?</i>

53:31.389 --> 53:32.348
You want me to call the police?

53:32.432 --> 53:35.351
No, no, let Frank handle it.
He'll know what to do.

53:35.435 --> 53:37.604
<i>As prepared as any man can be
to pay for something he didn't do.</i>

53:37.687 --> 53:38.772
Listen.

53:38.980 --> 53:42.567
You didn't message over a package
to my apartment, did you?

53:42.817 --> 53:43.443
No.

53:43.693 --> 53:46.112
<i>There is a lot of people out there
that believe in your innocence.</i>

53:46.321 --> 53:47.113
<i>And I'm grateful.</i>

53:47.322 --> 53:48.615
You know anyone that might have?

53:48.823 --> 53:50.617
<i>- No.
- I'm grateful for their prayers.</i>

53:50.825 --> 53:53.036
<i>- Everything goes to your office.
- And support.</i>

53:53.119 --> 53:54.996
What about Pollard.
Find anything on her?

53:55.830 --> 53:57.374
You didn't actually paid her,
did you, Jack?

53:57.582 --> 54:00.251
- Pay her, what do you mean?
- She works for a escort service.

54:00.460 --> 54:01.920
Escort service?

54:02.212 --> 54:03.922
<i>You didn't know?</i>

54:04.339 --> 54:05.590
No, I didn't know.

54:08.009 --> 54:11.638
What? She told me she was a lawyer.
A student lawyer.

54:12.138 --> 54:14.140
<i>What are your thoughts
this time?</i>

54:14.224 --> 54:16.768
<i>Well, Stephanie, that's one thing
I don't have a lot of...</i>

54:17.102 --> 54:18.978
You got a number for her?

54:20.313 --> 54:21.648
<i>Yeah, a phone number
and the address.</i>

54:21.815 --> 54:23.191
I know the address.

54:23.942 --> 54:24.943
Let me have the number.

54:25.151 --> 54:27.278
<i>If Dr. Gramm was with us right now,
what would you say to him?</i>

54:27.362 --> 54:30.156
<i>555-1352.</i>

54:30.365 --> 54:32.158
<i>He knows that I didn't do this.</i>

54:32.867 --> 54:33.827
<i>- There's only one...
- Thanks.</i>

54:33.910 --> 54:37.997
<i>Other person in this world
who knows I've been framed.</i>

54:38.248 --> 54:42.377
<i>That it was a set up.
That I'm totally innocent.</i>

54:43.044 --> 54:47.173
<i>And that would be the forensic
psychiatric Dr. Jack Gramm.</i>

54:48.049 --> 54:51.219
<i>I guess what I'd say to Jack Gramm...
I'd say, "Why me"?</i>

54:53.096 --> 54:56.141
<i>I understand that you've suffered
a great loss with your sister.</i>

54:56.599 --> 54:59.060
<i>I feel your pain, Dr. Gramm.</i>

54:59.519 --> 55:01.312
<i>- Pick it up, damn it.
- But that doesn't exonerate you...</i>

55:01.396 --> 55:05.859
<i>from false accusing me of things that
you know I did not, could not have done.</i>

55:05.942 --> 55:07.152
Pick up, Sara.

55:07.902 --> 55:10.447
<i>If I can be convicted
of this voodoo forensic science...</i>

55:10.530 --> 55:12.032
<i>think about it... Who is safe?</i>

55:15.285 --> 55:16.453
Shelley?

55:16.703 --> 55:18.955
Shelley?
I want you to get MS-NBC.

55:19.039 --> 55:21.958
<i>- I want to talk to that son-of-bitch.
- I would be the last.</i>

55:22.208 --> 55:23.710
Jack, I really don't think
that's a good idea.

55:24.002 --> 55:27.130
It's a good idea. Just get them
and when you get them call me back, OK?

55:27.714 --> 55:30.884
<i>But I find hard to believe that
Dr. Jack Gramm can be out there...</i>

55:31.217 --> 55:34.804
<i>psycho battling innocent people
into the death chamber.</i>

55:35.305 --> 55:37.182
<i>Who is the murder now, Jack?</i>

55:38.058 --> 55:38.892
Yeah?

55:39.476 --> 55:40.894
<i>Who is the murder now?</i>

55:41.269 --> 55:42.729
<i>Jack?</i>

55:43.021 --> 55:45.356
We got D'Franco in custody.

55:45.607 --> 55:47.108
I got the warrant.

55:47.317 --> 55:49.444
The guys are on the way
over to his place.

55:49.527 --> 55:51.279
Did he say anything about Forster?

55:51.488 --> 55:53.448
<i>A quite bit, but nothing useful.</i>

55:53.948 --> 55:55.200
What about Guy LaForge?

55:55.492 --> 55:58.745
He hasn't checked in with
his parole office in six weeks.

55:58.995 --> 56:02.123
Well, he was at my apartment building
less than an hour ago.

56:02.332 --> 56:04.000
And he said he's coming back.

56:05.001 --> 56:06.753
Listen, Frank.

56:06.961 --> 56:09.089
I got a call
a little while ago...

56:09.297 --> 56:11.174
saying I have 88 minutes
to live.

56:11.466 --> 56:14.177
Jesus, Jack.
Why 88 minutes?

56:19.432 --> 56:21.017
I don't know.

56:22.310 --> 56:24.437
<i>You have any idea
who this caller is?</i>

56:27.315 --> 56:31.945
You better find Guy LaForge
before he gets here, okay?

56:32.028 --> 56:33.988
Listen, let me call you back.

56:34.155 --> 56:35.240
Jack?

56:36.324 --> 56:37.033
Shit.

56:54.676 --> 56:55.802
<i>Mom.</i>

56:56.052 --> 56:57.595
<i>Dad.</i>

56:57.846 --> 56:59.055
<i>Jack.</i>

56:59.764 --> 57:01.182
<i>There's someone in here.</i>

57:01.349 --> 57:03.309
<i>And he wants to talk to you.</i>

57:03.935 --> 57:05.353
<i>Where are you?</i>

57:05.437 --> 57:07.564
<i>Please, come home quickly!</i>

57:07.814 --> 57:09.733
<i>I'm here with a man.</i>

57:10.108 --> 57:12.193
<i>It is not what
you want me to say...</i>

57:13.027 --> 57:16.823
<i>Jack, come here now!
Help me. Help me.</i>

57:29.919 --> 57:31.504
Jack, what is that?

57:33.048 --> 57:34.466
My sister.

57:35.216 --> 57:36.718
Oh, my God!

57:38.219 --> 57:41.097
That's horrible.
Who would send that to you?

57:43.725 --> 57:46.352
There's only two copies
of this tape in the world.

57:46.436 --> 57:47.812
One is...

57:48.229 --> 57:51.024
Iocked up in custody of NYPD.

57:51.066 --> 57:52.442
And the other...

57:54.819 --> 57:57.864
is in a restricted access room...

57:58.031 --> 58:00.116
in my office file cabinet...

58:01.826 --> 58:04.371
with the highest
security measures.

58:04.412 --> 58:06.247
So you're thinking it was stolen.

58:06.664 --> 58:08.625
Of course it was stolen.

58:15.757 --> 58:17.133
You think I stole it?

58:18.885 --> 58:20.595
You think I stole it?

58:20.804 --> 58:22.680
You left the bar yesterday night
with Dale.

58:22.764 --> 58:26.017
One of the last people to see
her alive. Maybe the last.

58:26.226 --> 58:30.480
Jack, you think I stole the tape
and killed Dale?

58:30.647 --> 58:32.023
Have you lost your mind?

58:32.273 --> 58:35.110
I don't have clearance
to your restricted access room.

58:35.193 --> 58:37.195
Why Guy LaForge was at the bar
last night?

58:39.322 --> 58:41.324
<i>He was trying to protect me.</i>

58:41.700 --> 58:42.951
<i>From what?</i>

58:44.411 --> 58:47.038
- From you.
- From me? He knows about me?

58:47.205 --> 58:48.707
- Yes.
- What does he know about me?

58:48.957 --> 58:52.085
He knows I have
a silly girlish crush on you.

58:53.169 --> 58:54.754
Jack. Hold on a second.

58:54.879 --> 58:57.716
I just got an email
from Mike Stempt, okay?

58:57.966 --> 59:00.760
He saw Guy at Darby's Club
last night.

59:00.969 --> 59:03.430
When Mike left at 3 am,
Guy was still sitting there...

59:03.471 --> 59:05.515
and they've bounced a beer
until 6 am.

59:05.974 --> 59:09.060
So there's no way that Guy
could have killed Dale Morris.

59:17.610 --> 59:20.447
<i>- Yeah?
- Did you listen to the tape, Dr. Gramm?</i>

59:20.613 --> 59:23.033
<i>Why did you leave the little Katie
all alone?</i>

59:23.199 --> 59:24.659
<i>Why, Dr. Gramm?</i>

59:24.826 --> 59:29.122
<i>She'd still be alive today if you
hadn't left her all alone to die.</i>

59:30.123 --> 59:33.960
<i>Now it's your turn.
In a glaze of glory!</i>

59:34.294 --> 59:35.754
<i>Tic-tac, doc.</i>

59:35.962 --> 59:37.213
<i>You have 37 minutes.</i>

59:50.643 --> 59:51.311
Yeah?

59:51.519 --> 59:54.606
Hey, Jack, I got MS-NBC on the line.
I'll patch you through the prison.

59:54.856 --> 59:57.650
<i>- You're sure you wanna do this?
- Shelley.</i>

59:58.568 --> 01:00:02.864
There's been a breach in my place,
in my most secure area.

01:00:03.323 --> 01:00:07.118
Did you ever give anyone clearance
to go into my secure files?

01:00:07.202 --> 01:00:08.328
Jack, what are you saying?

01:00:08.536 --> 01:00:11.998
Did you ever let
an unauthorized person...

01:00:12.082 --> 01:00:14.042
into my secure files area?

01:00:14.292 --> 01:00:17.003
No, never.
To anyone.

01:00:17.212 --> 01:00:17.962
Ever.

01:00:18.213 --> 01:00:19.381
Okay.

01:00:20.382 --> 01:00:22.967
Now put me through the MS-NBC.

01:00:28.556 --> 01:00:29.849
Frank?

01:00:29.891 --> 01:00:33.228
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah, turn on the MSN-BC.</i>

01:00:33.436 --> 01:00:36.689
They've granted Forster
a live interview.

01:00:36.898 --> 01:00:38.525
<i>I can't, Jack,
I'm in the car.</i>

01:00:38.733 --> 01:00:43.029
It's all right. They also will cast.
You just turn on 750 AM.

01:00:43.279 --> 01:00:44.531
I'm phoning in.

01:00:44.989 --> 01:00:48.076
Wait a second. You think is such
a good idea? With all the court actions?

01:00:48.159 --> 01:00:51.496
I think he's behind everything. I think
he's behind the phone calls, threats...

01:00:51.579 --> 01:00:54.416
I'm gonna try to get inside his head.
Make him crack.

01:00:54.624 --> 01:00:56.459
Okay?
You wanna stay on the line, please?

01:00:57.752 --> 01:00:59.379
<i>- Dr. Gramm?
- Yeah.</i>

01:00:59.462 --> 01:01:00.046
<i>You're on the air.</i>

01:01:00.296 --> 01:01:04.050
<i>I've been told that we have Dr. Gramm
joining us by phone.</i>

01:01:04.092 --> 01:01:06.428
<i>- Dr. Gramm, are you there?
- I'm here.</i>

01:01:06.678 --> 01:01:08.221
<i>Have you been watching
the interview?</i>

01:01:08.304 --> 01:01:10.682
<i>- Is that what you call it?
- What would you call it?</i>

01:01:10.932 --> 01:01:13.393
I don't know, I don't call it an
interview. I call it an entertainment.

01:01:13.476 --> 01:01:15.395
I call it a performance, maybe.

01:01:15.562 --> 01:01:17.689
<i>You must have got something to say
or you wouldn't have called in.</i>

01:01:17.897 --> 01:01:21.568
Oh, yeah, I think it's very interesting
that Forster talks about forgiveness.

01:01:21.776 --> 01:01:24.821
I just want him to know that
his victims have not forgiven him.

01:01:24.904 --> 01:01:27.073
<i>Look, you've lied under oath,
Dr. Gramm, and you know it.</i>

01:01:27.115 --> 01:01:30.160
This is not about me.
This about the women you've raped...

01:01:30.243 --> 01:01:31.911
and tortured and murdered.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.206
<i>- Women like Janie Kay.
- I have nothing to do with her death...</i>

01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:37.083
<i>- and you know it.
- Nothing to do with her death?</i>

01:01:37.125 --> 01:01:40.712
There was an eyewitness,
a twin sister who identified you.

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.714
She was at the scene
and identified you.

01:01:42.797 --> 01:01:44.507
<i>She was drugged
and beaten so badly...</i>

01:01:44.591 --> 01:01:46.551
<i>she said that she couldn't
be sure, but you...</i>

01:01:46.634 --> 01:01:48.428
<i>you bereaved her until she said
it was me.</i>

01:01:48.636 --> 01:01:50.180
Interesting that you didn't say
that you're innocent.

01:01:50.263 --> 01:01:53.266
<i>- I had nothing to do with the death...
- No, I don't. I know you're convicted.</i>

01:01:53.391 --> 01:01:55.143
You're convicted by a jury.

01:01:55.226 --> 01:01:57.145
You were trialed and convicted,
that's what I know.

01:01:57.187 --> 01:01:59.272
<i>Trial? That wasn't a trial,
that was an inquisition.</i>

01:01:59.355 --> 01:02:00.440
<i>And the jury believed your lies.</i>

01:02:00.523 --> 01:02:04.652
You had to cause pain, suffer and death,
so you could feel alive.

01:02:04.861 --> 01:02:05.570
<i>Wait a second.</i>

01:02:05.653 --> 01:02:08.114
<i>Pain and suffer is something that you,
forensics, know how to inflict.</i>

01:02:08.198 --> 01:02:12.452
Even your idol, Ted Bundy,
ultimately, identified his victims.

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:15.288
How about, man,
identify your victims?

01:02:15.497 --> 01:02:16.122
How about?

01:02:16.206 --> 01:02:21.795
The bodies of Terry Hines, Alicia Smith,
Samantha Green. Where are they, man?

01:02:22.003 --> 01:02:22.962
Come on, where are they?

01:02:23.171 --> 01:02:26.966
Give these people's families closure,
man! Give them closure.

01:02:27.008 --> 01:02:30.261
You're on national television now!
Millions of people are watching you.

01:02:30.345 --> 01:02:30.887
Come on!

01:02:30.970 --> 01:02:33.014
<i>How about your colleague in London,
in the Clark case?</i>

01:02:34.182 --> 01:02:37.727
<i>Putting in an innocent mother
for murdering her baby? Well done!</i>

01:02:37.936 --> 01:02:41.398
<i>Well done, doctor. You must be so proud
of being part of an elite fortunate.</i>

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.484
<i>Fortunately for her,
her conviction was overturned...</i>

01:02:44.526 --> 01:02:47.946
<i>when the doctor's testimony
turned out to be an absurd.</i>

01:02:48.154 --> 01:02:49.406
<i>Quack, quack, Dr. Gramm?</i>

01:02:49.656 --> 01:02:50.990
<i>You now what?</i>

01:02:51.199 --> 01:02:53.493
<i>Why don't you take a good look
at your watch?</i>

01:02:53.702 --> 01:02:55.078
<i>A good look.</i>

01:02:55.787 --> 01:02:59.916
<i>Now imagine what it'd be like to be
minutes away from your own death.</i>

01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:02.210
<i>To hear the ticking of a clock...</i>

01:03:02.419 --> 01:03:05.422
<i>and know that your time on earth
is drying to a close.</i>

01:03:07.173 --> 01:03:08.466
Thank you.

01:03:10.135 --> 01:03:13.263
<i>There's another package for you,
Dr. Gramm. Should I send it up?</i>

01:03:13.596 --> 01:03:15.348
<i>This has just got in.</i>

01:03:15.598 --> 01:03:19.102
<i>A three judge panel of the Nine Circuit
has just granted John Forster...</i>

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:20.729
<i>a stay of the execution.</i>

01:03:22.647 --> 01:03:23.648
<i>What?</i>

01:03:26.943 --> 01:03:28.111
<i>Are you serious?</i>

01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:34.617
You hear that, Frank?

01:03:34.909 --> 01:03:36.161
Yeah, I heard.

01:03:36.578 --> 01:03:38.038
Forster got the stay.

01:03:38.413 --> 01:03:41.583
I got him going, didn't I?
No cigar.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.919
<i>Why did you send me
on a wild goose chase, Jack?</i>

01:03:45.086 --> 01:03:46.212
What do you mean,
wild goose chase?

01:03:46.296 --> 01:03:49.132
D'Franco is not a serial killer,
he's a serial groupie.

01:03:49.299 --> 01:03:51.551
So he's a groupie so what?
What's the big deal?

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.512
<i>I've just got a call from Jeremy Guber
from attorney general office.</i>

01:03:54.721 --> 01:03:57.599
You are wanted for questioning
on the murder of Dale Morris.

01:03:57.932 --> 01:04:00.018
What?
What are you talking about?

01:04:00.268 --> 01:04:03.938
They've found physical evidence at
her apartment that implicates you, Jack.

01:04:04.147 --> 01:04:05.065
What evidence?

01:04:05.106 --> 01:04:06.149
Jack...

01:04:06.649 --> 01:04:08.401
you know I can't say.

01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:11.237
<i>What you mean, you can't say?
What does that mean?</i>

01:04:11.863 --> 01:04:14.574
<i>- Frank?
- There's someone to see you...</i>

01:04:14.616 --> 01:04:16.326
<i>Mister, you can't go up there.</i>

01:04:17.202 --> 01:04:18.828
You told the doorman
to don't let anyone up.

01:04:18.912 --> 01:04:21.623
It's all right, don't worry.
Don't worry, no-one is getting in.

01:04:29.422 --> 01:04:32.634
<i>The state attorney general
has just announced that his appealing...</i>

01:04:32.717 --> 01:04:34.719
<i>is taken to the State Supreme Court
immediately.</i>

01:04:35.011 --> 01:04:36.096
Jack. There's smoke.

01:04:36.137 --> 01:04:38.640
<i>We'll keep you informed
with further developments.</i>

01:04:41.684 --> 01:04:43.436
There's smoke here too.

01:04:59.869 --> 01:05:01.287
It's your boyfriend.

01:05:01.496 --> 01:05:02.706
<i>Let Kim go.</i>

01:05:02.914 --> 01:05:04.332
<i>Let her go now
and no-one will get hurt.</i>

01:05:04.499 --> 01:05:07.502
Guy, I'm fine.
There's no problem here.

01:05:07.669 --> 01:05:10.130
<i>The building is on fire.
That's a problem.</i>

01:05:10.338 --> 01:05:12.090
- He's got a gun.
- Okay. Listen to me.

01:05:12.382 --> 01:05:14.843
I know this man and I know
he's not gonna hurt me again.

01:05:14.926 --> 01:05:16.970
You have to trust me, Jack.
Please, open the door.

01:05:17.137 --> 01:05:19.514
<i>- Do it quickly. There's smoke up here.
- Kim.</i>

01:05:19.723 --> 01:05:23.268
Guy, I'm coming out.
We can calm things down, okay?

01:05:24.853 --> 01:05:27.689
Guy, look at me.
I'm fine. There's no problem here.

01:05:27.939 --> 01:05:31.484
- What are you doing with him?
- I'm okay. There's no problem.

01:05:33.737 --> 01:05:36.406
Guy has been shot.
No!

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:48.043
On the roof there's a fire escape.
Okay?

01:05:48.293 --> 01:05:51.212
- When I say "go", follow me.
- Okay.

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.024
Do you think he is dead?

01:06:11.232 --> 01:06:14.277
- He doesn't look good.
- We should go back up there.

01:06:14.903 --> 01:06:16.821
I gotta go back there
and help him.

01:06:17.238 --> 01:06:20.033
No. You can't go up there.
Man.

01:06:21.242 --> 01:06:23.078
<i>- Yeah?
- Jack, I need to talk to you.</i>

01:06:23.244 --> 01:06:25.246
I need two minutes to clarify
something?

01:06:25.413 --> 01:06:26.831
Shelley, I can't talk now.

01:06:27.082 --> 01:06:29.584
<i>I'll talk to you
when I get to Sara Pollard apartment.</i>

01:06:33.254 --> 01:06:35.632
Miss. Lewinsky.
Are you okay?

01:06:35.799 --> 01:06:37.884
- I'm just a little bit dizzy.
- Come.

01:06:41.513 --> 01:06:44.057
Because I didn't see
a device with a timer.

01:06:44.265 --> 01:06:46.267
Get the bomb squad,
this is the second one.

01:06:46.351 --> 01:06:47.477
Go.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.982
- Get her some oxygen.
- All right. We got her, sir.

01:06:53.108 --> 01:06:55.068
Let's go outside.
You gonna be all right.

01:07:02.951 --> 01:07:05.495
Jack, I don't see the shooter,
do you?

01:07:06.788 --> 01:07:07.580
Jack.

01:07:07.706 --> 01:07:09.916
- He's got a gun.
- Where?

01:07:10.417 --> 01:07:11.876
Where the hell is he?

01:07:12.085 --> 01:07:13.545
- Where?
- Jack!

01:07:13.837 --> 01:07:15.296
Get down!

01:07:20.468 --> 01:07:21.761
- Kim!
- Keep moving!

01:07:21.845 --> 01:07:23.096
Kim, where are you?

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.614
Go, go, go!

01:07:41.948 --> 01:07:43.450
Move back!

01:07:43.742 --> 01:07:46.828
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm gonna live.

01:07:47.537 --> 01:07:49.122
Here, let's go.

01:07:49.456 --> 01:07:50.623
Where are we going?

01:07:51.583 --> 01:07:53.334
To Sara Pollard house.

01:07:53.501 --> 01:07:55.795
She's the girl I was with
last night.

01:07:57.172 --> 01:07:59.215
That's funny.
It worked in the garage.

01:08:04.721 --> 01:08:06.014
Why did you do that?

01:08:06.222 --> 01:08:08.308
I don't know.
I had a feeling...

01:08:26.618 --> 01:08:27.952
Are you okay?

01:08:31.997 --> 01:08:33.457
What next?

01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:35.877
I don't know.

01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:42.175
- Okay, let's get out of here.
- Okay.

01:08:49.599 --> 01:08:51.350
- Is that your cab?
- Yeah.

01:08:51.559 --> 01:08:53.603
Okay.
I give you a hundred bucks...

01:08:53.685 --> 01:08:56.022
you let me drive it.
I'm just going across town.

01:08:56.106 --> 01:08:57.273
A hundred bucks?

01:08:57.816 --> 01:09:00.609
A hundred bucks plus tip.
How is that?

01:09:00.859 --> 01:09:02.028
All right.

01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:17.377
<i>I can not believe that.</i>

01:09:18.086 --> 01:09:19.379
Guy is dead.

01:09:20.212 --> 01:09:21.381
He is. He is dead.

01:09:23.883 --> 01:09:25.051
Shit.

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:31.933
You have not to say, huh?

01:09:32.015 --> 01:09:35.145
It's just another day
in the life of Jack Gramm.

01:09:43.361 --> 01:09:44.529
Okay.

01:09:46.322 --> 01:09:48.408
Can you wait outside the cab
for a minute?

01:09:49.658 --> 01:09:51.202
- You bet.
- Thanks.

01:09:56.291 --> 01:09:58.418
You asked me about
my kid sister.

01:09:58.585 --> 01:10:00.503
Okay. It was a long time ago.

01:10:00.754 --> 01:10:03.298
She was staying at my apartment
in New York City.

01:10:03.506 --> 01:10:05.925
She was 12, I was 28.

01:10:06.134 --> 01:10:09.095
And I was late for a meeting.
Very important meeting.

01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:11.431
A meeting
that was gonna change my life.

01:10:11.514 --> 01:10:14.309
It was gonna make me
into somebody important.

01:10:15.643 --> 01:10:17.979
Make all my dreams come true,
so...

01:10:18.188 --> 01:10:20.774
I went to this meeting
on my dissertation.

01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:24.110
And I left her there by herself.

01:10:24.652 --> 01:10:27.989
I could have taken her with me.
I could have left her with friends.

01:10:28.073 --> 01:10:30.700
I could have postpone
the meeting.

01:10:31.159 --> 01:10:34.079
But I chose not to,
because I was in a hurry.

01:10:34.287 --> 01:10:36.373
Anyway, I left her there alone.

01:10:36.581 --> 01:10:39.125
At that time I was working
in a case...

01:10:39.334 --> 01:10:42.087
and this guy had strangled
six women.

01:10:42.337 --> 01:10:44.798
We were very close to nail him.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.551
He was upset
and he wanted to get back at me.

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.555
So he came to my apartment,
only I wasn't there.

01:10:52.889 --> 01:10:56.351
And that time I wasn't concerned
with security.

01:10:57.268 --> 01:10:59.771
I was careless so...

01:11:02.273 --> 01:11:04.192
he broke the door down...

01:11:04.234 --> 01:11:05.819
and he went in.

01:11:07.612 --> 01:11:08.822
And did...

01:11:09.823 --> 01:11:11.157
things...

01:11:11.741 --> 01:11:13.576
to my baby sister.

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:16.955
Katheryn, was her name.

01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:18.498
Katy.

01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:22.836
He did things that you wouldn't do
to an animal...

01:11:22.919 --> 01:11:25.171
that was bred for slaughter.

01:11:29.384 --> 01:11:30.510
Anyway...

01:11:33.847 --> 01:11:35.473
when they caught him...

01:11:36.307 --> 01:11:37.767
he laughed...

01:11:39.227 --> 01:11:40.562
and said...

01:11:41.896 --> 01:11:44.357
it took him 88 minutes...

01:11:57.078 --> 01:12:00.206
it took him 88 minutes
to have my sister dead.

01:12:00.248 --> 01:12:01.499
Jack...

01:12:04.377 --> 01:12:06.337
He is in prison now.

01:12:09.549 --> 01:12:12.260
Coming up for
his fifth parole hearing.

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:15.430
I left New York.

01:12:15.638 --> 01:12:18.850
Left all that behind me
and came here, to Seattle.

01:12:19.392 --> 01:12:22.479
You know,
it seemed the perfect place.

01:12:23.688 --> 01:12:25.648
It's on the far off corner...

01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:29.110
of the continent of USA.

01:12:29.486 --> 01:12:32.155
To see if I had
a second hanged in me.

01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:37.410
Whoever stole that tape...

01:12:38.244 --> 01:12:40.580
knows the meaning of 88 minutes.

01:12:46.419 --> 01:12:47.754
Is that enough?

01:12:51.508 --> 01:12:52.675
Let's go.

01:13:02.477 --> 01:13:05.063
If Sara is not home,
we don't have a search warrant.

01:13:05.146 --> 01:13:07.690
Well, we don't need a search warrant.
We're not gonna arrest anybody.

01:13:07.774 --> 01:13:09.567
We're just breaking in.

01:13:14.322 --> 01:13:16.116
Not a good sign.

01:13:19.285 --> 01:13:21.246
You can't say
I've never give you anything.

01:13:21.496 --> 01:13:24.165
This looks familiar.
When did you take it?

01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:27.043
I guess it doesn't matter,
does it?

01:13:27.252 --> 01:13:28.670
It just might.

01:13:32.882 --> 01:13:34.968
- Okay, check out that way.
- Okay.

01:14:17.343 --> 01:14:18.094
Oh, Jesus.

01:14:22.599 --> 01:14:23.933
What is it?

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.936
Oh, my God.

01:14:27.395 --> 01:14:29.022
Oh, my God!

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:31.149
Calm, Kim.

01:14:31.232 --> 01:14:34.277
- Calm, Kim.
- Oh, my God. She is dead.

01:14:34.986 --> 01:14:35.987
It's okay.

01:14:36.071 --> 01:14:39.449
- Who would do that? Why?
- Calm, Kim.

01:14:39.574 --> 01:14:42.327
- Who could torture someone like that?
- Just, breathe.

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:45.622
- Breathe, breathe.
- Okay.

01:14:46.331 --> 01:14:47.957
- Breathe.
- Oh, God.

01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:50.251
- Control. Take control.
- Okay.

01:14:51.252 --> 01:14:52.879
I'm in control.

01:14:53.088 --> 01:14:55.382
- Are you in control?
- Yeah.

01:14:55.548 --> 01:14:57.842
- Okay, good. Let me show you something.
- Okay.

01:14:59.010 --> 01:15:00.804
That is my signature.

01:15:01.679 --> 01:15:04.682
Forged.
Credit card receipt.

01:15:05.141 --> 01:15:07.352
This whole place
is filled with my DNA.

01:15:07.685 --> 01:15:09.521
The police is gonna come here.

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:12.774
They gonna know I was with Sara.
They gonna think that I killed her.

01:15:14.651 --> 01:15:15.777
- Your phone.
- Yeah.

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:17.320
Answer, Jack.

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:21.157
Yeah.

01:15:21.449 --> 01:15:23.243
<i>- Jack?
- Carol?</i>

01:15:23.952 --> 01:15:24.953
Carol?

01:15:25.203 --> 01:15:28.164
Did you here the tape with
your sister's 88 minutes of suffering?

01:15:28.581 --> 01:15:30.917
<i>I sent it to your apartment.</i>

01:15:31.876 --> 01:15:34.129
What are you saying, Carol?
What is this?

01:15:34.462 --> 01:15:36.256
The Porsche was a close call.

01:15:37.674 --> 01:15:40.593
<i>I called Frank and told him
you murdered Sara after you killed Dale.</i>

01:15:43.596 --> 01:15:45.265
<i>Think you are so smart...</i>

01:15:45.724 --> 01:15:47.600
<i>invincible and unbeatable.</i>

01:15:48.143 --> 01:15:52.147
<i>John Forster is giving you a death
sentence and he is about to be free.</i>

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:54.274
<i>How ironic.</i>

01:15:55.483 --> 01:15:57.610
You've got 18 minutes left.

01:15:58.153 --> 01:15:59.904
Meet me at your office alone.

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:01.656
<i>Tic-tac.</i>

01:16:03.867 --> 01:16:05.160
What is it?

01:16:05.243 --> 01:16:06.703
It's Carol.

01:16:07.912 --> 01:16:11.458
She wants to meet me at the university,
at my office.

01:16:12.792 --> 01:16:13.918
Let's go.

01:16:14.502 --> 01:16:15.795
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:16:34.064 --> 01:16:36.483
Shelley? What the hell
are you doing in here?

01:16:37.484 --> 01:16:39.152
I need to talk to you.

01:16:42.072 --> 01:16:45.158
That poor girl.
That poor... poor girl.

01:16:47.827 --> 01:16:49.496
- It was me.
- Sit, sit.

01:16:49.579 --> 01:16:52.248
- It was me.
- Shelley, sit down.

01:16:53.666 --> 01:16:56.711
I broke the security protocol.

01:16:59.547 --> 01:17:00.673
Why?

01:17:02.967 --> 01:17:04.803
Well, about six weeks ago...

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:08.932
I had a drink in your office
with a student of yours.

01:17:09.682 --> 01:17:10.642
<i>A couple of drinks, actually.</i>

01:17:11.142 --> 01:17:15.271
And she made an advance,
and...

01:17:16.731 --> 01:17:20.235
<i>It was late, but the office was
jammed with people working still.</i>

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:26.741
<i>And when we woke up she left.
She didn't have a briefcase...</i>

01:17:26.825 --> 01:17:28.910
she didn't have anything
she could put the tape in, but...

01:17:28.993 --> 01:17:30.954
but somebody else must have.

01:17:31.162 --> 01:17:34.082
Somebody else did,
while we're sleeping.

01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:37.168
Who was this girl?
What's her name?

01:17:39.212 --> 01:17:40.463
It was Lauren.

01:17:41.631 --> 01:17:43.174
Lauren Douglas.

01:17:46.761 --> 01:17:48.179
And here is the...

01:17:49.305 --> 01:17:50.849
It's a picture
from the security cameras.

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:53.852
This is the person that must have
rifle through my files...

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:56.688
and found the combination
to your vault and took the tape.

01:17:56.771 --> 01:17:59.107
That's not a person, Shelly.
It's a hat and a coat.

01:17:59.357 --> 01:18:04.779
And this the photo ID of everyone that
has visited Forster on the last month.

01:18:06.406 --> 01:18:07.449
Oh...

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:11.077
Can you ever forgive me?

01:18:14.164 --> 01:18:16.207
If I can't forgive you, Shelley...

01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:18.835
I don't deserve you.

01:18:19.753 --> 01:18:21.004
Understand?

01:18:24.883 --> 01:18:27.260
I want you to call Carol
and patch her through to me.

01:18:27.343 --> 01:18:29.054
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:18:30.346 --> 01:18:31.514
Kim?

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:38.229
Kim?

01:18:40.648 --> 01:18:43.443
Hi, can you transfer me
to Lynn Johnson office, please?

01:18:45.945 --> 01:18:47.197
Kim?

01:18:49.657 --> 01:18:50.742
Kim?

01:19:07.801 --> 01:19:09.010
Kim?

01:19:14.849 --> 01:19:16.935
Where are you going in such a hurry,
Jack?

01:19:17.143 --> 01:19:19.604
Is there something upstairs
that you don't want me to see?

01:19:20.313 --> 01:19:23.566
There's a woman named Sara Pollard
upstairs very dead.

01:19:23.650 --> 01:19:24.818
You can see her, if you'd like.

01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:27.487
Look, I'm a straight shooter,
right, Jack?

01:19:27.612 --> 01:19:29.406
- Yeah.
- And you'd never screw me over, right?

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:30.448
Oh, come on.

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:33.827
Why are your finger prints all over
Dale Morris apartment?

01:19:35.078 --> 01:19:36.496
- They are?
- Yeah.

01:19:36.705 --> 01:19:39.708
And you were right about the Halothane
on the blood stream.

01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:43.962
What you failed to mention is the fact
that your semen is in her vagina cavity.

01:19:44.212 --> 01:19:46.339
Is your semen in Sara Pollard?

01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:48.883
Where the hell are you going
with this, Frank?

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:50.969
Can't you see this is a frame?

01:19:51.177 --> 01:19:54.013
Forster is coordinating
this whole thing from prison.

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:55.890
- Can't you see that?
- Yeah, right.

01:19:55.974 --> 01:19:59.227
It is Forster's semen on Sara Pollard
it's yours, Jack?

01:19:59.436 --> 01:20:03.565
Somebody hired Sara Pollard
to be with me last night...

01:20:03.815 --> 01:20:05.233
then killed her...

01:20:05.608 --> 01:20:09.696
took my semen
and deposit into Dale Morris.

01:20:09.904 --> 01:20:11.823
Do you have any idea
how absurd that sounds?

01:20:11.906 --> 01:20:12.824
No, it's not absurd.

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:14.576
I don't have time to explain,
Frank.

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.244
Carol isn't answering.

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:17.662
What? What?

01:20:17.912 --> 01:20:19.122
Carol isn't answering.

01:20:20.206 --> 01:20:23.668
Get the names of all the women lawyers
who work for Forster.

01:20:23.877 --> 01:20:25.170
I want their names and ages.

01:20:25.378 --> 01:20:27.714
- Look, I know how you operate, Jack.
- What the hell are you doing?

01:20:28.089 --> 01:20:29.799
I know how you use people.

01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:32.886
It's no secret you're a womanizer,
you drink too much.

01:20:33.136 --> 01:20:35.764
How do I know that you haven't gone
completely over the edge?

01:20:35.847 --> 01:20:37.390
- Oh, man, I can't believe it!
- How do I know?

01:20:37.474 --> 01:20:39.225
- I don't know what you do anymore.
- What did I do, Frank?

01:20:39.559 --> 01:20:41.519
Did I send myself a tape?

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:44.898
Did I blow up my car?
Did I set my apartment on fire?

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:46.900
Did I fire bullets at myself?

01:20:46.941 --> 01:20:49.069
For God sakes, Frank, wake up!

01:20:49.277 --> 01:20:52.822
- What the hell... What are you doing?
- I have no idea who you're anymore.

01:20:53.281 --> 01:20:54.741
You don't?

01:20:54.949 --> 01:20:57.494
- I got Gramm. I'm bringing him in.
- No, you're not gonna do this.

01:20:57.619 --> 01:21:00.914
Frank. Frank.
Just give me some time.

01:21:01.039 --> 01:21:03.708
Just give me some time.
I can untangle this. Okay?

01:21:03.917 --> 01:21:05.752
Just give me...
Here, give me some time.

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:09.089
Don't move
or I'll blow your head off.

01:21:12.008 --> 01:21:14.260
Don't point a gun at me, Frank.

01:21:14.844 --> 01:21:17.931
Don't point a gun at me.
Please.

01:21:26.564 --> 01:21:29.275
I wanted to sync up our watches,
that's all.

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:38.827
All right, Jack.

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:41.746
What do you need?

01:21:42.205 --> 01:21:45.166
I need time.
I need ten minutes. Okay?

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:47.127
Here, let's sync up now.

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:51.881
At 11:40, meet me at my office
at the university.

01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:07.439
Kim? What happened?

01:22:07.981 --> 01:22:11.735
<i>I know you're only trying to help me,
but don't go to my office on campus.</i>

01:22:11.943 --> 01:22:14.988
<i>You understand? It's dangerous.
Don't be a hero.</i>

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:18.616
When you get this message,
call me back A.S.A.P.

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.076
You understand? It's Jack.

01:22:23.038 --> 01:22:24.330
Yeah.

01:22:24.414 --> 01:22:26.833
<i>There's still no answer
at Johnson's office.</i>

01:22:26.916 --> 01:22:29.002
Hold on. Yeah.

01:22:29.252 --> 01:22:30.253
<i>- Jack?
- Kim...</i>

01:22:30.336 --> 01:22:33.465
whatever you do, don't go to my office
on the campus. Do you understand?

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:35.216
You have 14 minutes.

01:22:36.342 --> 01:22:37.343
What?

01:22:37.427 --> 01:22:39.512
<i>It was me, Jack.
I set you up.</i>

01:22:40.263 --> 01:22:42.390
I had a computer dialing service
call you up...

01:22:42.474 --> 01:22:45.101
rearranging times,
using electronic altered voice.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.687
Kim, this is no time to joke.

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:50.231
Meet me in your office
in ten minutes, Jack.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.400
11:40. Don't be late.

01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:53.651
Kim!

01:22:55.028 --> 01:22:56.029
Kim!

01:23:31.523 --> 01:23:32.899
Oh, shit.

01:23:38.279 --> 01:23:39.406
Man...

01:23:46.621 --> 01:23:47.414
Yeah.

01:23:47.497 --> 01:23:50.417
<i>Hey, Jack, I got the names
of the women on Forster's legal team.</i>

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:51.918
They were three.

01:23:52.043 --> 01:23:56.756
Hannah Baker, 53.
Rosane Caputto, 47, and...

01:23:56.965 --> 01:23:58.216
Lydia Doherty, 28.

01:23:58.508 --> 01:24:00.760
And Lydia Doherty, 28.
How did you know?

01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:03.012
Cause her name is on the signature sheet
you gave me.

01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:05.557
I want you to do a search
on Lydia Doherty.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.809
I want you to get all the information
you can.

01:24:08.059 --> 01:24:11.479
<i>Fax it to my office on campus.
Okay? Do it now.</i>

01:24:31.624 --> 01:24:33.418
Hey, another hundred bucks
and I'll wait.

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:17.337
What the hell
are you doing in here?

01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:21.466
This is Lauren Douglas bag.

01:25:22.592 --> 01:25:25.136
It was stolen today.
I found it in your desk.

01:25:27.097 --> 01:25:28.390
Halothane.

01:25:29.224 --> 01:25:30.683
What is it doing here?

01:25:31.017 --> 01:25:32.477
What are you doing in here?

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.396
This is what you used
to kill Dale and Sara?

01:25:34.604 --> 01:25:36.606
Or do you have no idea
about this too?

01:25:37.524 --> 01:25:38.483
Oh, sure I do.

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:41.986
I left all this stuff in my desk
so you'd come along and find it.

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:43.947
You convinced the jury
that Forster was guilty.

01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:45.573
How do I know you didn't kill
these women too?

01:25:45.657 --> 01:25:46.616
Who sent you here?

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:49.703
Yeah.
I'd like to report a suspect...

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:51.287
- in the Seattle Slayer case.
- What the hell...

01:25:51.371 --> 01:25:52.872
- Dr. Jack Gramm.
- Put down the goddamn phone!

01:25:52.956 --> 01:25:54.833
What's the matter with you?
Who sent you here?

01:25:54.999 --> 01:25:56.710
You think I'm too dumb
to figure it out from myself?

01:25:56.751 --> 01:25:57.711
Yes, I do.

01:25:57.794 --> 01:26:02.048
Because whoever sent you here is deeply
involved in the Slayer killings.

01:26:02.298 --> 01:26:03.466
Lydia Doherty.

01:26:03.883 --> 01:26:06.177
- Lydia Doherty.
- What the hell is that?

01:26:09.597 --> 01:26:10.515
Yeah?

01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:12.016
<i>Come to the Stern Building now.</i>

01:26:12.267 --> 01:26:14.060
Corner office, seventh floor.

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:15.729
<i>Alone.</i>

01:26:18.273 --> 01:26:19.691
You have five minutes, Jack.

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:23.778
- What are you doing?
- I'm not moving.

01:26:24.738 --> 01:26:27.824
I don't have time to explain this.

01:26:28.033 --> 01:26:29.200
Get away from the door.

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:30.660
- Come on!
- You're gonna shoot me?

01:26:35.957 --> 01:26:37.000
Yeah.

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:40.795
I'm a bad shot.

01:26:43.673 --> 01:26:46.634
Frank, when you get this message
I'm gonna be at the Stern Building...

01:26:46.676 --> 01:26:49.387
on the seventh floor.
Get there as soon as you can.

01:28:48.256 --> 01:28:49.549
Oh, God.

01:28:50.842 --> 01:28:52.844
Punctual, Dr. Gramm.

01:28:54.179 --> 01:28:57.265
I'm gonna give you a B+
for effort.

01:28:57.557 --> 01:29:00.852
Lynn Johnson is indisposed, but
I'm sure she'd say hello, if she could.

01:29:01.061 --> 01:29:04.397
As for your old friend, Kim,
she didn't quite make the grade.

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:06.024
- Lydia.
- You got the name right.

01:29:06.107 --> 01:29:09.069
Lydia Doherty.
Copy cat murderer.

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:11.571
God, I wish Forster
could see your face.

01:29:11.654 --> 01:29:13.490
You look so totally clueless.

01:29:17.619 --> 01:29:19.829
I hope that's not a gun
you're holding.

01:29:20.789 --> 01:29:22.999
Is that a gun, Dr. Gramm?

01:29:23.625 --> 01:29:24.709
What do you want?

01:29:25.001 --> 01:29:26.419
Is that a gun?

01:29:27.253 --> 01:29:29.714
- I have a gun.
- Then do this.

01:29:31.216 --> 01:29:32.759
Put it on the floor...

01:29:33.635 --> 01:29:35.345
and slide it to me.

01:29:37.639 --> 01:29:38.932
To me.

01:29:42.477 --> 01:29:43.561
Okay.

01:29:48.358 --> 01:29:49.401
Okay.

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:52.695
You slide it.

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.332
One more time, slide it to me.

01:30:09.671 --> 01:30:10.755
Slowly.

01:30:12.173 --> 01:30:13.466
And move back.

01:30:19.973 --> 01:30:20.807
Better.

01:30:43.997 --> 01:30:46.207
I'd like to talk to John Forster,
please.

01:30:46.291 --> 01:30:48.168
This is his appeal attorney,
Lydia Doherty.

01:30:49.044 --> 01:30:51.046
They monitor his calls.

01:30:52.422 --> 01:30:54.758
- You gonna implicate him.
- The brilliant Dr. Gramm...

01:30:54.841 --> 01:30:56.801
and his psycho gamble,
is that it?

01:30:59.929 --> 01:31:01.890
<i>Sorry for the trouble I caused,
Dr. Gram.</i>

01:31:02.724 --> 01:31:05.226
<i>You know that I did, Dr. Gramm,
with honors.</i>

01:31:05.477 --> 01:31:08.855
<i>Dale told me how good you're
with her when her dad died.</i>

01:31:09.105 --> 01:31:10.482
<i>She was so grateful.</i>

01:31:11.066 --> 01:31:13.359
<i>But despite the fact that insanity
is a legal concept...</i>

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:15.820
<i>it doesn't mean
that someone is not sick.</i>

01:31:28.666 --> 01:31:30.085
Have him call me on my cell.

01:31:31.336 --> 01:31:32.879
He knows the number.

01:31:34.923 --> 01:31:38.176
- What do you want?
- What about you start with a confession?

01:31:38.927 --> 01:31:41.388
- I confess.
- To what?

01:31:41.679 --> 01:31:43.556
To what? To everything.

01:31:44.224 --> 01:31:45.809
I confess.

01:31:53.191 --> 01:31:55.902
I want you to speak clearly
and I want the truth.

01:31:55.944 --> 01:31:57.570
Where do I start?

01:31:57.779 --> 01:31:59.948
- Janie Kay.
- Janie Kay?

01:32:00.156 --> 01:32:01.616
I coached her.

01:32:02.701 --> 01:32:03.993
Shut it off.

01:32:05.662 --> 01:32:07.872
- Shut it off.
- I am.

01:32:10.875 --> 01:32:12.085
Go again.

01:32:12.836 --> 01:32:15.422
I coached Janie Kay.

01:32:15.714 --> 01:32:17.882
- In what trial?
- I coached Janie Kay...

01:32:17.966 --> 01:32:22.178
in John Forster's trial. I coached her.
She perjured herself.

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:24.556
I gave false testimony.

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:28.226
And John Forster was convicted.

01:32:28.435 --> 01:32:30.603
Based on an unlawful testimony.

01:32:30.812 --> 01:32:32.272
Based on an unlawful testimony.

01:32:34.899 --> 01:32:36.860
It's my little present for John.

01:32:37.068 --> 01:32:38.027
Thank you.

01:32:42.657 --> 01:32:43.825
What are you doing?

01:32:44.367 --> 01:32:45.744
Are you assessing me?

01:32:47.996 --> 01:32:50.290
Are you looking for a weakness,
Dr. Gramm?

01:32:50.498 --> 01:32:53.543
I'm just wondering what is next.

01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:58.757
Aren't you gonna offer
to make me a deal?

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:01.634
Sacrifice yourself
for Kim and Carol?

01:33:02.927 --> 01:33:04.304
Be the hero.

01:33:04.721 --> 01:33:08.266
Well, that wouldn't fly out, would it?
I'd offer, but it wouldn't fly.

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:09.309
Rejected.

01:33:10.268 --> 01:33:12.020
Have any other moves?

01:33:13.563 --> 01:33:15.982
Or you spent so quickly...

01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:20.945
I could move my eyes, like this,
e look behind you.

01:33:22.364 --> 01:33:24.741
To see if there is someone there
with a gun pointed to your head.

01:33:27.827 --> 01:33:30.288
- How much time I got left?
- You have about a minute.

01:33:31.956 --> 01:33:32.832
Jack.

01:33:33.083 --> 01:33:35.794
Enough time for your last words.
I'm not gonna deny you those.

01:33:37.295 --> 01:33:39.506
All this torture,
all this torment...

01:33:40.965 --> 01:33:42.092
for an infatuation?

01:33:42.217 --> 01:33:44.302
It's not an infatuation,
don't demean me.

01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:47.680
Well, if it's not an infatuation
what is it?

01:33:49.933 --> 01:33:51.309
Stop, please!

01:34:08.118 --> 01:34:10.787
<i>I went through great lengths
to pull this off.</i>

01:34:12.205 --> 01:34:14.666
<i>John really appreciates
the quality of my work.</i>

01:34:15.333 --> 01:34:16.418
<i>Timing the phone calls...</i>

01:34:16.793 --> 01:34:19.838
<i>perfecting the ropes and plus
implicating everyone close to you.</i>

01:34:20.088 --> 01:34:22.048
Coaching Carol and Kim.

01:34:23.007 --> 01:34:24.718
All the while staying invisible.

01:34:24.926 --> 01:34:26.678
<i>It was me, Jack. I set you up.</i>

01:34:26.928 --> 01:34:28.722
You know what I don't understand?

01:34:28.930 --> 01:34:33.184
How, in God's name,
does anybody give up their free will?

01:34:33.601 --> 01:34:34.936
How you do that?

01:34:35.019 --> 01:34:37.188
- 45 seconds.
- I saw you.

01:34:37.272 --> 01:34:40.108
You came to my class,
I remember you.

01:34:40.358 --> 01:34:42.944
You were intelligent.
An individual.

01:34:43.236 --> 01:34:44.487
You challenged things.

01:34:44.571 --> 01:34:47.073
You challenged me.
You challenged ideas.

01:34:47.574 --> 01:34:49.200
You're your own person.

01:34:49.451 --> 01:34:54.414
How could you ever allowed yourself
to be so manipulated by this guy?

01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:55.623
30 seconds.

01:34:55.665 --> 01:34:57.208
You're gonna take the fall
for this guy?

01:34:57.375 --> 01:34:59.919
If that's what he wants,
so be it.

01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:02.088
You see, Jacko...

01:35:02.672 --> 01:35:03.882
I'm a true believer.

01:35:03.965 --> 01:35:06.259
You better believe
that's an FBI agent...

01:35:06.301 --> 01:35:08.636
with a gun pointed right
into your head...

01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:09.763
at this moment.

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:11.639
Believe it.

01:35:11.848 --> 01:35:14.267
- No more kidding.
- Believe it.

01:35:15.685 --> 01:35:17.479
- Believe it.
- I believe your time is up...

01:35:17.562 --> 01:35:19.022
Dr. Gramm.

01:35:33.787 --> 01:35:35.121
God.

01:35:36.748 --> 01:35:38.041
Jack!

01:35:40.168 --> 01:35:41.503
Jack!

01:35:41.586 --> 01:35:42.545
No!

01:35:46.216 --> 01:35:47.300
Jack!

01:35:47.592 --> 01:35:48.802
Jack!

01:35:55.392 --> 01:35:56.601
No!

01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:57.894
Jack!

01:35:58.186 --> 01:35:59.270
No!

01:35:59.687 --> 01:36:00.730
Jack!

01:36:01.648 --> 01:36:02.816
No!

01:36:06.319 --> 01:36:07.445
No!

01:36:44.023 --> 01:36:45.108
Again!

01:36:55.243 --> 01:36:57.162
I got you. I got you.

01:36:57.579 --> 01:36:58.663
It's okay.

01:36:58.747 --> 01:36:59.873
It's okay, sweetheart.

01:37:03.168 --> 01:37:05.170
Requesting immediately MT help.

01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:08.423
At the UNW Campus,
Stern Building.

01:37:08.882 --> 01:37:10.133
I repeat.

01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:13.261
Immediately emergency
medical technician.

01:37:13.845 --> 01:37:15.764
Multiple stab wounds.

01:37:18.975 --> 01:37:20.143
There you go.

01:37:21.811 --> 01:37:24.022
That's okay.
Don't move.

01:37:40.955 --> 01:37:41.581
Yeah.

01:37:41.664 --> 01:37:44.709
<i>This is officer Finnegan
from the State Penitentiary Walla Walla.</i>

01:37:44.876 --> 01:37:47.879
<i>I'm placing a call from John Forster
to his attorney Lydia Doherty.</i>

01:37:47.962 --> 01:37:49.255
Put him through.

01:37:50.215 --> 01:37:51.549
<i>Go ahead.</i>

01:37:51.633 --> 01:37:52.759
Lydia.

01:37:54.010 --> 01:37:55.428
Did you finish with Gramm?

01:37:55.637 --> 01:37:58.014
- She's downstairs.
- Gramm?

01:38:01.309 --> 01:38:02.602
Put my attorney on the phone,
please.

01:38:02.852 --> 01:38:03.895
She's indisposed.

01:38:04.145 --> 01:38:06.064
Look, you're meddling her.
You shouldn't be meddling in.

01:38:06.314 --> 01:38:10.985
You seized a naive junior lawyer
on your legal staff.

01:38:11.653 --> 01:38:14.447
<i>You realized that she's damaged
psychologically and...</i>

01:38:14.489 --> 01:38:15.240
Genius, isn't it?

01:38:15.490 --> 01:38:18.034
Susceptible to your craps.
And what you do?

01:38:18.243 --> 01:38:19.786
You get her to kill people for you.

01:38:19.994 --> 01:38:21.413
So you can stay alive.

01:38:21.663 --> 01:38:24.457
That's an innovative legal strategy,
if I have ever heard of any.

01:38:24.666 --> 01:38:27.460
Dr. Gramm, I'm flattered
with your imagination.

01:38:28.169 --> 01:38:29.295
But you're grasping in straw.

01:38:29.462 --> 01:38:32.173
She becomes a student of mine,
no less...

01:38:32.465 --> 01:38:35.635
you keep her on the appeal process,
but she's still your lawyer...

01:38:35.719 --> 01:38:38.138
so she has unlimited access
to you...

01:38:38.346 --> 01:38:41.516
so you can plan
your copy cat murders together.

01:38:41.850 --> 01:38:44.018
And then you can get a new trial.

01:38:44.102 --> 01:38:46.646
And live happily ever after.
Isn't that the case?

01:38:46.813 --> 01:38:50.066
Dr. Gramm, I want you to listen
very closely...

01:38:50.859 --> 01:38:52.902
because when I get out of here...

01:38:53.528 --> 01:38:55.488
I'm gonna go out and
have a nice meal...

01:38:56.156 --> 01:38:57.866
stop by your grave...

01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:00.493
and piss all over it.

01:39:01.870 --> 01:39:04.372
Now, please, put my angelical attorney
on the phone.

01:39:04.622 --> 01:39:05.331
She's dead.

01:39:06.583 --> 01:39:08.376
<i>It's over, Forster.</i>

01:39:08.626 --> 01:39:10.503
<i>Except for the clock,
that goes tic-tac.</i>

01:39:10.754 --> 01:39:13.465
Tic-tac.
You got 12 hours to live.

01:39:47.290 --> 01:39:49.209
All right, fellows...

01:39:55.298 --> 01:39:57.217
- How is Lynn Johnson?
- Well...

01:39:57.467 --> 01:40:02.013
She just threw out of the house.
She didn't want me to be late for class.

01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:04.349
Jack, I have to ask you
something.

01:40:04.432 --> 01:40:07.394
Was Lydia telling the truth?
Did you coach Janie?

01:40:07.769 --> 01:40:11.356
You believe Forster killed those people?
All those people?

01:40:11.481 --> 01:40:14.275
- Yes.
- Janie's sister and everybody?

01:40:14.359 --> 01:40:16.319
- Yes.
- Beyond reasonable doubt?

01:40:16.528 --> 01:40:19.906
- Absolutely.
- What would you have done in my shoes?

01:40:21.449 --> 01:40:22.617
Don't answer it.

01:40:22.826 --> 01:40:24.077
Think about it.

01:40:24.452 --> 01:40:25.704
Justice...

01:40:26.287 --> 01:40:27.580
and truth.

01:40:29.124 --> 01:40:30.750
Where do they intersect?

01:40:47.684 --> 01:40:48.601
Hi.

01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:55.358
Hello, everyone.

01:41:00.572 --> 01:41:02.407
John Forster is dead.

01:41:04.868 --> 01:41:07.829
<i>His execution is not a cause...</i>

01:41:08.997 --> 01:41:10.457
<i>for celebration.</i>

01:41:11.249 --> 01:41:13.668
<i>Nor is a vindication.</i>

01:41:14.335 --> 01:41:17.172
<i>It is a chapter...</i>

01:41:18.631 --> 01:41:21.426
<i>in the road to justice
and recovery.</i>

01:41:23.762 --> 01:41:25.263
I personally...

01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:29.768
don't believe
in capital punishment.

01:41:32.604 --> 01:41:33.897
I do believe...

01:41:34.981 --> 01:41:37.650
in the rights of the victims.

01:41:39.402 --> 01:41:40.904
<i>I do believe...</i>

01:41:41.946 --> 01:41:44.366
<i>that they deserve recompense.</i>

01:41:44.616 --> 01:41:49.662
<i>No matter how significant
or insignificant it may be...</i>

01:41:50.038 --> 01:41:52.499
in comparison
to the loss suffered.

01:41:55.168 --> 01:41:57.253
I've suffered such a loss.

01:41:59.172 --> 01:42:01.508
And like some of you here...

01:42:02.384 --> 01:42:05.136
I've spent
those sleepless nights...

01:42:06.888 --> 01:42:08.932
trying desperately to...

01:42:10.517 --> 01:42:14.312
squelch down that
bullish instinct for revenge.

01:42:17.565 --> 01:42:19.943
<i>And I have wondered...</i>

01:42:20.276 --> 01:42:22.487
<i>Jack, look at me.
Look at the kite.</i>

01:42:23.363 --> 01:42:24.864
<i>If this pain will...</i>

01:42:26.157 --> 01:42:29.035
<i>- ever abate.
- Smile!</i>

01:42:30.745 --> 01:42:32.205
<i>I've learnt...</i>

01:42:33.289 --> 01:42:37.335
<i>that time does not heal
the wound.</i>

01:42:38.503 --> 01:42:41.214
<i>It will though, in its most...</i>

01:42:42.716 --> 01:42:44.592
merciful way...

01:42:48.054 --> 01:42:50.432
plant the edge ever so slightly.

01:42:57.605 --> 01:42:58.940
So...

01:43:07.323 --> 01:43:09.409
What is the first thing...

01:43:09.617 --> 01:43:13.163
one should remember
when entering a court room?
