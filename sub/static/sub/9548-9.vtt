00:46.800 --> 00:48.479
That was pretty damn good.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.059
That was better than good.

00:50.060 --> 00:51.980
That was sensational.

00:53.410 --> 00:56.149
Oh, an empty bottle.

00:56.150 --> 00:57.819
The saddest sight in the world.

00:57.820 --> 00:58.639
Where's willie?

00:58.640 --> 00:59.909
He's always got a little money.

00:59.910 --> 01:01.849
He left like 20 minutes ago.

01:01.850 --> 01:03.179
He run and looking for bottles.

01:03.180 --> 01:05.570
Collecting bottles, huh? For redeemables.

01:08.310 --> 01:12.190
Help! Somebody!

01:12.580 --> 01:14.400
Help!

01:15.430 --> 01:17.210
Help!

01:18.420 --> 01:19.680
Oh, there he is.

01:19.860 --> 01:24.560
Hey, willie! Willie, hello!

01:28.340 --> 01:29.809
You gotta help me. Call the police.

01:29.810 --> 01:30.809
Someone's after me.

01:30.810 --> 01:31.709
What'd you do?

01:31.710 --> 01:33.669
Nothing! Some guy, he started chasing me!

01:33.670 --> 01:35.140
I think he's trying to kill me.

01:35.730 --> 01:37.309
Ain't nobody there.

01:37.310 --> 01:38.609
He's got the willies.

01:38.610 --> 01:40.070
Willie got the willies.

01:41.620 --> 01:42.919
Oh, hell, there he is!

01:42.920 --> 01:45.339
You're being paranoid. Maybe I am.

01:45.340 --> 01:47.320
I ain't sticking around to find out.

01:48.140 --> 01:49.980
Hey, you forgot one!

01:51.210 --> 01:52.739
Run, willie, run!

01:52.740 --> 01:54.560
Run, willie, run!

02:05.390 --> 02:06.660
Oh, willie!

02:06.740 --> 02:07.629
Willie!

02:07.630 --> 02:09.000
Where you at?

02:09.190 --> 02:10.669
It's us!

02:11.350 --> 02:12.900
Here's his cart.

02:40.650 --> 02:42.290
It's a jungle out there

02:43.120 --> 02:45.640
Disorder and confusion everywhere

02:47.390 --> 02:49.740
No one seems to care

02:49.900 --> 02:50.730
Well I do

02:50.860 --> 02:53.480
Hey, who's in charge here?

02:53.680 --> 02:55.570
It's a jungle out there

02:57.490 --> 03:00.250
Poison in the very air we breathe

03:00.930 --> 03:03.040
Do you know what's in the water that you drink?

03:03.260 --> 03:07.330
Well I do, and it's amazing

03:07.710 --> 03:10.880
People think I'm crazy, 'cause I worry all the time

03:11.080 --> 03:13.140
If you paid attention, you'd be worried too

03:14.350 --> 03:15.640
You better pay attention

03:15.810 --> 03:21.630
Or this world we love so much might just kill you

03:22.340 --> 03:26.220
I could be wrong now, but I don't think so

03:26.550 --> 03:28.660
It's a jungle out there

03:29.210 --> 03:31.060
It's a jungle out there

03:38.830 --> 03:40.370
Is that your tree?

03:41.160 --> 03:42.490
It's cardboard.

03:42.510 --> 03:44.710
Right. No muss, no fuss.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.710
A lot of people are doing it.

03:46.780 --> 03:47.890
Who?

03:48.300 --> 03:49.470
People...

03:49.660 --> 03:51.480
You know, who are me.

03:54.820 --> 03:55.919
What do you think?

03:55.920 --> 03:57.989
I think it's sad.

03:57.990 --> 03:58.899
Well, I know it's sad.

03:58.900 --> 03:59.939
I mean, is it straight?

03:59.940 --> 04:02.150
Christmas doesn't mean anything to you?

04:02.240 --> 04:03.820
Not anymore.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.689
Why don't you believe in anything, mr. Monk?

04:05.690 --> 04:07.419
What are you so afraid of?

04:07.420 --> 04:08.079
I'll tell you what I think.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.089
I think mr. Monk has been afraid of so many things

04:10.090 --> 04:12.789
For so many years, he's afraid of not being afraid.

04:12.790 --> 04:14.670
What does that mean? Think about it.

04:14.930 --> 04:15.889
I'm afraid to.

04:15.890 --> 04:17.459
Honey, will you try this? This is chicken soup.

04:17.459 --> 04:18.399
It's for the captain.

04:18.399 --> 04:19.249
What's wrong with him?

04:19.250 --> 04:21.039
Oh, he's very, very sick.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.479
It's been three or four weeks now.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.019
Yeah, he's got some sort of arthritis.

04:24.020 --> 04:25.259
He can barely walk.

04:25.260 --> 04:27.679
Mm, it's perfect. He's gonna love it.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.069
I'm really worried about him.

04:29.070 --> 04:31.430
I mean, I've known him for 15--

04:32.430 --> 04:33.960
Is that my ladle?

04:34.410 --> 04:35.549
Is that a problem?

04:35.550 --> 04:36.639
No, it's fine.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.060
Help yourself.

04:38.120 --> 04:38.869
I'll get it.

04:38.870 --> 04:40.880
Wait, i--may i?

04:41.770 --> 04:43.980
I just thought of something I want for christmas.

04:45.420 --> 04:46.419
A new ladle.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.509
And a lock for my utensil drawer.

04:48.510 --> 04:51.470
Uh, mr. Monk, these men want to talk to you.

04:53.630 --> 04:55.919
Hello. Are you mr. Monk, the detective?

04:57.600 --> 04:58.850
That's ike.

04:59.510 --> 05:02.299
That's reggie. And they call me the professor.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.679
We asked around.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.109
And they says you was the best.

05:05.110 --> 05:07.009
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

05:07.010 --> 05:08.590
I'm retired.

05:08.820 --> 05:09.789
As of when?

05:09.790 --> 05:12.449
As of "hello, are you mr. Monk?"

05:12.450 --> 05:13.889
He's not retired.

05:13.890 --> 05:15.419
He's joking, he's joking.

05:15.420 --> 05:16.839
So would you guys li

05:16.840 --> 05:17.849
To have a seat?

05:17.850 --> 05:19.189
No, no, no!

05:19.190 --> 05:20.509
No, that couch doesn't work.

05:20.510 --> 05:22.079
None of these chairs--

05:22.080 --> 05:24.119
Hey, I have an idea.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.149
Uh, why don't we all stand on some newspaper?

05:26.150 --> 05:27.439
Julie, go get some newspaper.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.249
Everybody hold it in until we get some newspaper, okay?

05:30.250 --> 05:31.289
Hold what in?

05:31.290 --> 05:32.829
What do you think we're gonna do?

05:32.830 --> 05:33.619
I don't know. I don't know.

05:33.620 --> 05:35.229
Just hold it in. Hold it.

05:35.230 --> 05:37.240
Can we do anything for you gentlemen?

05:37.460 --> 05:40.840
Last night, a friend of ours was killed.

05:40.870 --> 05:43.610
And we want to hire mr. Monk to investigate.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.419
Did you talk to the police?

05:45.420 --> 05:47.359
They didn't really listen, ma'am.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.879
They said it was an accident.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.169
And that willie-- that's his name--

05:51.170 --> 05:53.149
He climbed into an old refrigerator

05:53.150 --> 05:55.119
To stay warm, closed the door,

05:55.120 --> 05:56.869
And then suffocated.

05:56.870 --> 05:57.539
Accidents.

05:57.540 --> 05:58.539
But you don't think so.

05:58.540 --> 06:01.519
Last night, he said that someone was after him.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.399
Said someone was chasing him.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.909
But we didn't believe him.

06:04.910 --> 06:07.120
Delusional. We got money.

06:09.420 --> 06:11.049
You can redeem these anywhere.

06:11.050 --> 06:13.370
It comes to $14.

06:15.780 --> 06:16.829
So what you think?

06:16.830 --> 06:19.719
Uh, you know, mr. Monk and I are gonna mull that one over,

06:19.720 --> 06:21.489
But in the meantime, are you guys hungry?

06:21.490 --> 06:22.909
I just made some soup. I have a whole pot.

06:22.910 --> 06:24.209
Oh, we'd appreciate it, ma'am.

06:24.210 --> 06:25.329
Thank you, ma'am.

06:25.330 --> 06:27.800
Na--ja-- excuse me.

06:28.090 --> 06:29.150
Excu--

06:32.390 --> 06:33.779
Stay. Stay.

06:33.780 --> 06:35.949
Stay right where you are.

06:35.950 --> 06:38.930
Stay! Stay.

06:40.510 --> 06:41.299
What are you doing?

06:41.300 --> 06:42.799
You're not really gonna feed them.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.459
Of course I'm feeding them. They're hungry.

06:44.460 --> 06:46.149
Oh, natalie, natalie,

06:46.150 --> 06:48.159
I-i can't take this job.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.619
Please don't make me take this job.

06:49.620 --> 06:50.999
Mr. Monk, you have to help these men.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.369
Okay, here it comes.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.849
Number one, they have nowhere else to go.

06:53.850 --> 06:57.219
Number two, they collected cans and bottles to pay your salary.

06:57.220 --> 06:59.259
That's every nickel they have in the world.

06:59.260 --> 07:00.799
When was the last time a client offered you

07:00.800 --> 07:02.049
Every nickel they had?

07:02.050 --> 07:04.829
Excuse me. Throwing this away?

07:04.830 --> 07:05.789
You know what, it's all yours.

07:05.790 --> 07:06.659
You keep it.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.439
Oh, what is this, marble?

07:08.440 --> 07:09.239
I don't know.

07:09.240 --> 07:11.059
I don't know. Maybe.

07:11.060 --> 07:12.019
Yeah, maybe.

07:12.020 --> 07:13.370
Maybe it is.

07:13.990 --> 07:15.819
Okay, okay, okay, fine.

07:15.820 --> 07:17.989
Fine, fine, don't, don't, don't touch anything.

07:17.990 --> 07:19.200
You know what?

07:19.380 --> 07:21.189
Let's take a look at the crime scene.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.149
Here we go.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.549
Everybody out.

07:23.550 --> 07:25.229
Right. Show me the crime scene.

07:25.230 --> 07:27.170
Out--outside.

07:30.290 --> 07:32.770
We waited for him all night!

07:33.230 --> 07:34.809
Never came back!

07:34.810 --> 07:36.599
So we were looking for him, you know,

07:36.600 --> 07:38.189
Like a search party!

07:38.190 --> 07:39.279
Right there!

07:39.280 --> 07:42.589
We found his shopping cart right over there!

07:42.590 --> 07:44.049
Can you even see from there?

07:44.050 --> 07:44.959
I'm fine.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.060
Is that the refrigerator?

07:48.080 --> 07:50.219
Is that the refrigerator?

07:50.220 --> 07:50.939
What?

07:50.940 --> 07:52.949
Is that the refrigerator?

07:52.950 --> 07:53.729
Yes, sir.

07:53.730 --> 07:55.669
And then we noticed a piece of clothing--

07:55.670 --> 07:57.679
Part of his jacket sticking out.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.320
Protruding, as it were.

08:00.470 --> 08:02.110
So we opened it.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.999
He was kinda stuffed in there.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.299
Face-first.

08:07.300 --> 08:09.610
He was facing away from you?

08:09.910 --> 08:11.969
Did you tell that to the police?

08:11.970 --> 08:14.079
Yeah, but they don't listen to us, man.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.200
We're, like, invisible to them.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.059
What'd he say?

08:17.060 --> 08:18.940
What? We're like inv--

08:18.990 --> 08:20.709
They don't see us!

08:20.710 --> 08:23.370
So then what happened? He fell out!

08:23.920 --> 08:25.370
Backwards!

08:26.290 --> 08:27.490
Plop!

08:48.120 --> 08:49.219
What is it?

08:49.220 --> 08:51.210
There's only one handprint.

08:51.820 --> 08:54.220
He wasn't clawing around.

08:54.650 --> 08:56.310
He wasn't panicking.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.430
He was already dead.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.969
No, no, no, I'm not signing off on this

09:04.970 --> 09:06.520
Till I talk to the d.A.

09:07.110 --> 09:09.029
What was the victim's name again?

09:09.030 --> 09:10.689
Willie t. That's what they called him.

09:10.690 --> 09:11.929
But nobody knew his real name.

09:11.930 --> 09:13.769
The medical examiner rubberstamped it,

09:13.770 --> 09:15.129
But we just came from the crime scene.

09:15.130 --> 09:16.469
Randy, it is all wrong.

09:16.470 --> 09:19.069
I think somebody put him in that refrigerator.

09:19.070 --> 09:20.929
We talked to his bum friends.

09:20.930 --> 09:23.019
His friends. Not his bum friends.

09:23.020 --> 09:23.909
The ne'er-do-wells.

09:23.910 --> 09:25.349
They're homeless individuals.

09:25.350 --> 09:27.599
They said somebody was chasing him last night.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.429
Okay.

09:28.430 --> 09:29.929
Well, we'll reopen the case.

09:29.930 --> 09:31.099
I'll call the m.E. Myself.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.110
Just like that? Yeah, just like that.

09:34.260 --> 09:36.449
Oh, diaz, diaz, is that the revised affidavit?

09:36.450 --> 09:38.370
Uh, I think so. Yeah, let's see.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.809
Good, make sure this gets to judge barr,

09:42.810 --> 09:44.609
Not judge coleman.

09:44.610 --> 09:45.780
Yes, sir.

09:45.780 --> 09:46.619
Rookies.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.999
Wow, randy, you really are in charge.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.539
Yeah, well, when the captain got sick,

09:50.540 --> 09:51.849
Somebody had to step up.

09:51.850 --> 09:52.539
How's he doing?

09:52.540 --> 09:54.179
We've been trying to call him, but he doesn't answer.

09:54.180 --> 09:55.189
Well, that's because he's here.

09:55.190 --> 09:55.869
He's here?

09:55.870 --> 09:57.469
He's downstairs on the front desk.

09:57.470 --> 09:58.419
He said he couldn't stand

09:58.420 --> 09:59.619
Just sitting around his house.

09:59.620 --> 10:00.489
Is he okay?

10:00.490 --> 10:02.540
He got here last night, and he won't go home.

10:02.650 --> 10:04.029
It's like he's trying to prove something,

10:04.030 --> 10:05.640
And it's not just his back.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.810
He's in a bad place right now.

10:10.210 --> 10:13.140
So, mrs. Parisi...

10:13.770 --> 10:15.350
Let me get this straight.

10:15.450 --> 10:17.639
You filed a complaint 2 1/2 weeks ago,

10:17.640 --> 10:19.049
You said somebody vandalized your house.

10:19.050 --> 10:19.879
That's right.

10:19.880 --> 10:20.819
You said you thought

10:20.820 --> 10:22.119
Some teenagers painted this thing

10:22.120 --> 10:23.439
On your front door.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.069
This is not a thing.

10:25.070 --> 10:26.790
It's a fountain.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.070
Okay.

10:28.230 --> 10:31.559
So some teenagers painted this fountain on your front door

10:31.560 --> 10:33.149
And now you want to withdraw the complaint.

10:33.150 --> 10:33.979
That's right.

10:33.980 --> 10:36.950
It wasn't teenagers. I know that now.

10:37.250 --> 10:38.690
It was god.

10:41.170 --> 10:44.280
It was a sign from god.

10:47.090 --> 10:49.349
God drew a little picture on your front door.

10:49.350 --> 10:50.789
It was a miracle.

10:50.790 --> 10:52.259
Last summer I couldn't breathe.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.119
My lungs were burning. She couldn't breathe.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.539
We went to three different doctors.

10:55.540 --> 10:56.629
And then I heard on the news

10:56.630 --> 10:58.419
About the fountain

10:58.420 --> 11:00.719
At the franklin park monastery.

11:00.720 --> 11:01.559
They look just like this.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.899
It was this fountain.

11:02.900 --> 11:06.189
And when she drank from it, I was cured.

11:06.190 --> 11:07.689
She's eating again.

11:07.690 --> 11:09.200
She can sleep.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.419
It's a miracle. It's a miracle.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.289
It's a miracle.

11:12.290 --> 11:13.540
It's a miracle.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.760
Write that down. "it's a miracle.

11:17.930 --> 11:19.359
You walk me through this again?

11:19.360 --> 11:20.780
One more time.

11:21.070 --> 11:22.820
Oh, there he is.

11:25.100 --> 11:25.989
How you doing?

11:25.990 --> 11:27.119
I feel like I look.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.029
Oh, god, back problems are the worst.

11:29.030 --> 11:30.610
What did the doctor say?

11:31.260 --> 11:32.709
I got five doctors.

11:32.710 --> 11:34.430
And they haven't got a clue.

11:34.740 --> 11:37.130
They've got me on three different medications.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.289
I've tried everything. Even this crap.

11:40.290 --> 11:40.919
What is it?

11:40.920 --> 11:41.489
I don't know.

11:41.490 --> 11:43.769
It's some sort of organic, hippie concoction from hell.

11:43.770 --> 11:46.400
My aunt sent me a whole carton of it.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.139
Ugh, it tastes like chalk.

11:51.140 --> 11:52.340
What's in it?

11:53.430 --> 11:54.879
Chalk extract...

11:54.880 --> 11:56.759
Captain, why don't you just head on home?

11:56.760 --> 11:57.629
We got things covered here.

11:57.630 --> 11:59.310
Oh, no, I can't go home.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.099
Look at all those open cases.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.869
Actually, these ones are all cleared.

12:03.870 --> 12:06.160
We were nine for nine this week.

12:07.180 --> 12:08.880
Nine for nine.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.320
Good job.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.470
I guess I'll just go home.

12:13.790 --> 12:15.639
Not that anybody would notice.

12:15.640 --> 12:16.909
You think you'll be okay?

12:16.910 --> 12:18.190
I'm fine.

12:18.410 --> 12:20.899
Except for the alimony I can't afford,

12:20.900 --> 12:23.449
I haven't had a date in two--two years,

12:23.450 --> 12:27.169
And my son--my oldest boy jared is not talking to me.

12:27.170 --> 12:28.570
He's with his mother.

12:29.530 --> 12:31.750
He doesn't even pick up the phone.

12:32.930 --> 12:34.440
Merry christmas.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.440
Was there a sign on your house?

13:35.220 --> 13:36.420
Me too.

13:36.460 --> 13:38.100
I was the first one here.

13:38.690 --> 13:40.169
I was in a car accident last year.

13:40.170 --> 13:42.880
I busted my hip. They said I'd never walk again.

13:43.570 --> 13:47.039
Five weeks ago, the sign appeared on my garage door.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.370
It said, "drink."

13:49.120 --> 13:50.049
Drink?

13:50.050 --> 13:50.769
Two days later,

13:50.770 --> 13:52.229
I was on a tour group with my church.

13:52.230 --> 13:53.740
We stopped here.

13:54.030 --> 13:55.389
And there it was.

13:55.390 --> 13:56.980
So I drank.

13:58.070 --> 13:59.420
And...

13:59.890 --> 14:01.769
The doctor says it's a miracle.

14:01.770 --> 14:03.099
I think he's right.

14:03.100 --> 14:04.699
I've been telling everyone.

14:04.700 --> 14:07.249
I even went on the 6:00 news, you know.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.270
To spread the word.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.820
You're not a believer. I can tell.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.879
Believe me, I was a lot more skeptical than you.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.220
We all were.

14:28.980 --> 14:29.829
So what do you do?

14:29.830 --> 14:31.419
You're selling tickets? You got a gift shop?

14:31.420 --> 14:32.349
No.

14:32.350 --> 14:34.050
There's no gimmick here, my friend.

14:34.520 --> 14:36.009
Nobody's making a nickel on this.

14:36.010 --> 14:37.449
In fact, we're losing money.

14:37.450 --> 14:39.279
We were planning to build some classrooms

14:39.280 --> 14:40.890
Right where we're standing.

14:41.530 --> 14:42.679
And now?

14:42.680 --> 14:43.869
Well, we can't build here now.

14:43.870 --> 14:45.420
This is sacred ground.

14:48.850 --> 14:50.430
Are you a man of faith?

14:51.760 --> 14:53.859
Um, I was an altar boy, and I thought

14:53.860 --> 14:55.870
I wanted to be a priest when I was a kid.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.860
It's never too late.

14:58.300 --> 14:59.439
It's not a one-way street.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.860
You can always go back.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.480
Take a leap.

15:42.770 --> 15:44.810
$13.85.

15:45.020 --> 15:47.189
It was supposed to be $14.

15:47.190 --> 15:48.839
I counted $14.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.419
These three bottles are from canada.

15:50.420 --> 15:51.920
We can't accept them.

15:54.580 --> 15:55.409
All set?

15:55.410 --> 15:57.190
The bums ripped me off.

15:57.210 --> 15:58.729
Canadian bottles.

15:58.730 --> 16:00.749
Aw, why don't you just fly up to vancouver?

16:00.750 --> 16:01.769
You can redeem 'em there.

16:01.770 --> 16:03.039
Fly up to vancouver?

16:03.040 --> 16:04.189
You know how much that would cost?

16:04.190 --> 16:06.810
I mean, the taxi ride to the airport alone--

16:07.630 --> 16:09.509
I get it. You're joking.

16:09.510 --> 16:10.719
Ok, What's this?

16:10.720 --> 16:11.839
Flowers for the captain.

16:11.840 --> 16:12.949
No, I mean these.

16:12.950 --> 16:15.239
Utensils. New plates.

16:15.240 --> 16:15.949
Didn't I mention?

16:15.950 --> 16:18.899
I invited a few friends to your place for christmas dinner.

16:18.900 --> 16:20.079
I don't have any friends.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.379
Well, they're not really friends.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.039
They're really more clients.

16:23.040 --> 16:27.520
Well, I don't have any clients except the bums.

16:30.450 --> 16:33.500
I said, I don't have any clients except for the bums.

16:35.610 --> 16:37.220
Captain stottlemeyer!

16:38.160 --> 16:39.560
Feeling better?

16:40.800 --> 16:41.759
Not really.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.200
My brother-in-law had a bad back.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.609
You know what fixed it?

16:45.610 --> 16:47.329
What? Acupuncture.

16:47.330 --> 16:48.709
He swears by it.

16:48.710 --> 16:50.520
Been there. Done that.

16:50.730 --> 16:51.659
I've tried everything.

16:51.660 --> 16:54.100
I've tried crystals, acupuncture,

16:54.220 --> 16:56.349
This morning, I was at the monastery

16:56.350 --> 16:58.539
In franklin park drinking water from the fountain.

16:58.540 --> 17:00.839
Oh, yeah, it was on the news.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.630
The miracle fountain.

17:02.650 --> 17:04.069
Any luck?

17:04.640 --> 17:05.809
Not yet.

17:05.810 --> 17:08.200
Well, maybe it's a time-release miracle.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.000
Yeah, say,

17:11.740 --> 17:13.680
Are you a religious man?

17:13.730 --> 17:15.299
Can't say that I am.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.348
I only ask 'cause I saw the--

17:17.349 --> 17:18.878
Oh, my ex-partner

17:18.880 --> 17:20.660
Put that up the day we opened.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.398
Real devil dodger.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.779
Used to go to church every week for years.

17:24.780 --> 17:26.089
Rain or shine.

17:26.089 --> 17:28.519
Till the day he embezzled $18,000

17:28.520 --> 17:29.549
From me and disappeared.

17:30.890 --> 17:32.280
You got a partner?

17:33.600 --> 17:34.689
Yes, I do.

17:34.690 --> 17:35.669
Be careful.

17:35.670 --> 17:36.609
That's all I can tell you.

17:36.610 --> 17:38.399
Okay. You're all set.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.399
All right. Merry christmas.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.180
Okay, merry christmas.

17:48.070 --> 17:49.529
Good morning. Good morning.

17:49.530 --> 17:50.840
Sorry I'm late.

17:51.170 --> 17:52.169
What's that?

17:52.170 --> 17:54.929
I forgot the gravy for monday night, the big dinner.

17:54.930 --> 17:56.680
You wasted a trip.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.369
They make their own gravy.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.939
Who makes their own gravy?

17:59.940 --> 18:01.100
Bums.

18:01.430 --> 18:04.590
Bums make their own gravy. What does that even mean?

18:05.660 --> 18:07.240
You don't wanna know.

18:53.860 --> 18:57.579
Heavenly father, as you know, life ain't easy for us.

18:57.580 --> 18:59.659
But we know you're always there,

18:59.660 --> 19:01.430
Watching over us.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.229
And we want to thank you for sending our new friends

19:04.230 --> 19:07.539
Mr. Monk, natalie, and julie into our lives.

19:07.540 --> 19:10.409
And may we remember our brothers and sisters

19:10.410 --> 19:12.479
Less fortunate than ourselves

19:12.480 --> 19:14.400
In this season of giving.

19:14.500 --> 19:14.979
Amen.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.580
Amen. Amen.

19:18.810 --> 19:20.200
Mm, this is good.

19:20.430 --> 19:22.359
This stuffing is delicious.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.980
Oh, thank you, it's my grandmother's recipe.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.940
I love this gravy.

19:27.330 --> 19:29.469
Usually we make our own, but--

19:29.470 --> 19:31.929
Excuse me, could you repeat that

19:31.930 --> 19:32.799
About the gravy?

19:32.800 --> 19:34.979
Mm. Usually we make our own.

19:34.980 --> 19:36.749
Huh. Isn't that interesting?

19:36.750 --> 19:38.069
Natalie, did you hear that?

19:38.070 --> 19:39.639
Yes. Yes, I did.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.520
Good. Interesting.

19:53.200 --> 19:57.920
So, um, why do they you call you the professor?

19:57.950 --> 20:01.839
Julie, it's probably because he loves to read

20:01.840 --> 20:04.879
And probably because he's curious about the world

20:04.880 --> 20:06.890
And other cultures...

20:07.730 --> 20:09.260
I eat books.

20:23.720 --> 20:24.950
Excuse me.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.049
I'm just using my napkin to wipe away any food

20:29.050 --> 20:30.950
That might be on my face.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.179
I'm just wiping my face.

20:34.180 --> 20:35.480
It's fun.

21:10.300 --> 21:12.949
So how's our case coming?

21:12.950 --> 21:15.939
Actually, there's been some progress there.

21:15.940 --> 21:18.279
The medical examiner changed the cause of death.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.119
It wasn't an accident after all.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.950
Your friend was asphyxiated.

21:22.330 --> 21:23.610
He was drunk?

21:23.850 --> 21:27.650
No, no, no, no, he was suffocated.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.789
Probably with a plastic bag.

21:29.790 --> 21:32.239
It's good news, actually,

21:32.240 --> 21:34.269
Because now they'll reopen the case.

21:34.270 --> 21:36.249
Well, thank you for that, mr. Monk.

21:36.250 --> 21:38.230
I mean, we really appreciate that.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.789
It's the best 14 bucks we ever spent.

21:40.790 --> 21:43.619
Yeah, yeah, speaking of money,

21:43.620 --> 21:46.699
It wasn't exactly $14.

21:46.700 --> 21:48.779
You were a little short.

21:48.780 --> 21:50.110
Yeah, this--

21:51.930 --> 21:55.069
They wouldn't redeem these three bottles

21:55.070 --> 21:56.839
'cause they are from guess where?

21:56.840 --> 21:58.170
Canada.

22:00.340 --> 22:02.659
I mean, it's no big deal.

22:02.660 --> 22:04.770
It's 15 cents.

22:04.890 --> 22:07.000
It's hardly worth mentioning, but--

22:11.110 --> 22:13.030
Chalk extract.

22:16.820 --> 22:17.909
Hey, randy, have you seen the captain?

22:17.910 --> 22:19.149
We've been calling him all night.

22:19.150 --> 22:20.269
Well, he's not here.

22:20.270 --> 22:21.379
Why? What's going on?

22:21.380 --> 22:23.059
You remember the homicide I was working?

22:23.060 --> 22:24.079
Yeah, homeless guy.

22:24.080 --> 22:26.089
Right. His name was willie t.

22:26.090 --> 22:26.849
The night he was killed,

22:26.850 --> 22:28.389
He was out collecting bottles and cans.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.659
Yeah, remember that chalky herbal stuff

22:29.660 --> 22:30.729
The captain was drinking?

22:30.730 --> 22:32.929
There were three bottles of the same drink

22:32.930 --> 22:34.569
In willie's shopping cart.

22:34.570 --> 22:36.839
Which means that at some point that night

22:36.840 --> 22:39.350
He was in the captain's yard, right?

22:40.460 --> 22:42.319
Huh, that's interesting.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.659
Yeah, maybe the captain saw something,

22:43.660 --> 22:47.429
I mean, something unusual.

22:47.430 --> 22:48.559
What is that?

22:48.560 --> 22:49.259
What?

22:49.260 --> 22:50.249
On your face.

22:50.250 --> 22:52.800
On your lip.

22:53.210 --> 22:54.689
It looks a little bit like a moustache.

22:54.690 --> 22:56.970
Well, I'm in charge. It comes with the job.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.519
Okay, you're making me a little uncomfortable.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.630
You're making me a little uncomfortable.

23:06.810 --> 23:09.450
Anyways, guys, the captain's gone.

23:09.490 --> 23:10.789
You're too late.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.509
He came in yesterday, he grabbed some stuff,

23:12.510 --> 23:13.419
And he just left.

23:13.420 --> 23:14.670
For how long?

23:14.820 --> 23:16.320
He didn't say.

24:00.150 --> 24:02.370
I won't need these anymore.

24:09.130 --> 24:11.709
Uh, excuse me, what's going on?

24:11.710 --> 24:13.389
The fountain is blessed.

24:13.390 --> 24:15.069
Exodus 23.

24:15.070 --> 24:17.599
"and ye shall serve the lord your god.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.979
"and he shall bless thy bread and thy water.

24:19.980 --> 24:22.660
And I will take the sickness from amidst thee."

24:23.130 --> 24:25.569
Okay, we're looking for a friend of ours.

24:25.570 --> 24:29.140
Uh, they found his car parked out front.

24:29.450 --> 24:31.470
I haven't seen him. Sorry.

24:34.150 --> 24:36.149
Mr. Monk, look at all these people.

24:36.150 --> 24:37.429
They really believe in it.

24:37.430 --> 24:39.750
Well, they're people. They'll believe anything.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.229
Mr. Monk, you should try it.

24:42.230 --> 24:43.629
You should drink from the fountain.

24:43.630 --> 24:44.809
You can't be serious.

24:44.810 --> 24:46.429
You're in so much pain all the time, you know?

24:46.430 --> 24:47.959
What if there's something to it?

24:47.960 --> 24:50.160
You know? I mean, anything's possible.

24:50.340 --> 24:52.179
That's not exactly true.

24:52.180 --> 24:55.559
A lot of things are what we call impossible.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.529
It's the opposite of possible. I get it.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.099
I'll give you an example.

24:59.100 --> 25:00.990
Um, this.

25:02.660 --> 25:04.389
Hallelujah.

25:04.390 --> 25:08.080
Excuse me, we're looking for a friend of ours.

25:08.520 --> 25:09.710
Leland.

25:09.740 --> 25:10.930
He was here.

25:11.150 --> 25:12.560
He still is.

25:14.940 --> 25:16.589
Wow, it's beautiful.

25:16.590 --> 25:17.800
Is it?

25:17.910 --> 25:19.240
If you say so.

25:20.200 --> 25:21.099
Hello.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.610
I'm brother andrew.

25:23.700 --> 25:26.750
I'm natalie teeger, and this is adrian monk.

25:28.910 --> 25:30.570
Mr. Monk and the monk.

25:32.570 --> 25:33.359
Sorry.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.119
Are you allowed to laugh?

25:35.120 --> 25:36.840
We've been known to chuckle.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.309
We're looking for a friend of ours,

25:38.310 --> 25:39.719
Leland stottlemeyer.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.470
Oh, yes, brother leland.

25:41.510 --> 25:43.210
Brother leland?

25:43.310 --> 25:44.569
Can we talk to him?

25:44.570 --> 25:45.979
I'm afraid that's not possible.

25:45.980 --> 25:48.399
Brother leland has taken a vow of silence.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.039
Well, could we just see him?

25:51.040 --> 25:52.369
We won't say a word.

25:52.370 --> 25:53.759
We're investigating this homicide.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.399
It's very, very important.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.150
Well, you may go,

25:57.230 --> 25:59.639
But I'm afraid, miss teeger, you're not permitted

25:59.640 --> 26:01.470
Beyond the foyer.

26:05.460 --> 26:08.720
continue down the hall and up the stairs, Mr. Monk.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.340
Captain?

26:38.690 --> 26:41.200
Captain? Shh.

26:43.690 --> 26:46.170
Sorry. I'm just looking for...

26:50.490 --> 26:51.469
...A friend of mine.

26:51.470 --> 26:53.280
Here's the thing. Shh!

26:53.730 --> 26:54.949
Shh! Here's the thing.

26:54.950 --> 26:56.110
Here's the thing. Shh!

26:57.440 --> 26:58.680
Shh! Here's the thing.

27:00.400 --> 27:01.920
Shh! Here's the thing.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.360
Shh! Here's the--

27:08.070 --> 27:09.420
Here's-- shh!

27:13.010 --> 27:14.410
Shh! Here's--

27:14.730 --> 27:15.930
Here's-- shh!

27:17.130 --> 27:19.120
Shh! Here's the thing.

27:23.410 --> 27:25.139
Shh! Here's the thing.

27:25.140 --> 27:25.799
Here's-- shh!

27:25.800 --> 27:26.329
Here's-- shh!

27:26.330 --> 27:27.350
Shh! Here's--

27:28.180 --> 27:30.870
Shhhhhhhhhh!

27:38.270 --> 27:40.650
It doesn't matter. Shh!

27:44.460 --> 27:45.750
Captain?

27:46.750 --> 27:47.980
Capt--

28:05.570 --> 28:06.840
Leland?

28:09.210 --> 28:10.910
Are you okay?

28:11.540 --> 28:13.409
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,

28:13.410 --> 28:15.110
But I need-- shh!

28:17.650 --> 28:19.130
It's about the--

28:49.540 --> 28:50.730
Bum.

28:51.090 --> 28:52.290
Bum.

28:53.550 --> 28:56.160
The bum who was...

28:58.370 --> 28:59.760
Killed.

28:59.930 --> 29:01.769
He was at your house

29:01.770 --> 29:04.850
The night of the murder.

29:05.070 --> 29:07.490
Did you see him?

29:11.790 --> 29:13.230
Leland.

29:17.060 --> 29:21.190
Why are you here?

29:28.950 --> 29:30.390
The ceiling?

29:30.410 --> 29:31.900
It's beautiful.

29:36.660 --> 29:37.960
God?

29:40.110 --> 29:41.940
He spoke to you?

29:43.060 --> 29:44.560
What did he say?

30:07.090 --> 30:09.509
"my dear friends, drinking from that fountain

30:09.510 --> 30:10.959
"has healed me, not just physically,

30:10.960 --> 30:12.300
"spiritually too.

30:12.330 --> 30:13.659
"i have made a decision.

30:13.660 --> 30:15.359
"i am leaving on thursday morning,

30:15.360 --> 30:16.369
"christmas day,

30:16.370 --> 30:17.319
"to spend two years

30:17.320 --> 30:19.369
"at a mission in carmona, spain,

30:19.370 --> 30:21.579
To cleanse myself and start anew."

30:21.580 --> 30:22.809
Two years?

30:22.810 --> 30:24.600
"i want everyone to know

30:24.610 --> 30:26.719
"i am not running away from anything.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.759
"i'm running toward something--

30:28.760 --> 30:31.270
"something true and wonderful.

30:31.420 --> 30:32.820
"god bless you all,

30:33.430 --> 30:35.190
Brother leland."

30:39.060 --> 30:40.459
And here's his badge.

30:40.460 --> 30:41.980
Two years?

30:42.990 --> 30:45.100
That's almost three years.

30:45.380 --> 30:47.330
Without the captain?

30:48.020 --> 30:49.759
What am I supposed to do?

30:49.760 --> 30:52.359
It's almost as if he didn't even consider me.

30:52.360 --> 30:54.529
Well, maybe he knows what he's doing.

30:54.530 --> 30:56.600
Yeah. Maybe we should be happy for him.

30:59.270 --> 31:00.620
Okay.

31:01.650 --> 31:04.730
Okay. Let me try.

31:09.830 --> 31:11.990
No, that's not gonna happen.

31:12.860 --> 31:15.679
Mr. Monk, why don't you try it?

31:15.680 --> 31:17.259
Try what? Drinking from the fountain.

31:17.260 --> 31:18.659
It worked for the captain.

31:18.660 --> 31:19.899
I don't think so.

31:19.900 --> 31:21.429
Oh, god, mr. Monk, come on.

31:21.430 --> 31:23.579
You have to believe in something.

31:23.580 --> 31:24.609
I don't know what I'd do

31:24.610 --> 31:26.689
If I didn't think I'd see mitch again.

31:26.690 --> 31:28.119
You mean in heaven?

31:28.120 --> 31:29.119
Of course in heaven!

31:29.120 --> 31:30.249
Where'd you think I was going?

31:30.250 --> 31:33.679
Well, you know, the drinking, and you kissed a leper.

31:33.680 --> 31:34.749
You think I'm going to hell?

31:34.750 --> 31:35.589
She kissed a leper.

31:35.590 --> 31:36.489
Mr. Monk, seriously.

31:36.490 --> 31:39.929
Seriously, deep down, in your heart of hearts,

31:39.930 --> 31:42.770
Don't you believe that you'll see trudy again?

31:44.900 --> 31:45.409
All right, you know what?

31:45.410 --> 31:46.839
Come on. We'll be back in an hour.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.239
Don't open any christmas presents.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.649
What? Where are we going?

31:49.650 --> 31:51.749
This can count as my christmas gift.

31:51.750 --> 31:52.829
Where are we going?

31:52.830 --> 31:55.359
You look thirsty. I think you need a drink.

31:55.360 --> 31:56.259
What?

31:56.260 --> 31:58.760
Oh, no.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.400
Katie? What are you doing here?

32:26.410 --> 32:29.299
I told you we can't be seen together.

32:29.300 --> 32:31.550
You're going to ruin everything.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.560
Are you going somewhere?

32:38.040 --> 32:41.360
I-i can't do it anymore, owen.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.039
I'm sorry.

32:43.040 --> 32:46.029
These people, they're coming from all over now,

32:46.030 --> 32:48.149
And some of them are really sick.

32:48.150 --> 32:50.549
So what? You're not there.

32:50.550 --> 32:52.719
They're--they're throwing their medicine away.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.009
They really believe in the fountain.

32:55.010 --> 32:57.100
That was the whole idea.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.220
I promise I won't tell anyone.

33:00.240 --> 33:01.889
I just want to get away.

33:01.890 --> 33:03.740
Don't be a child!

33:05.600 --> 33:09.180
Nobody's going anywhere.

33:09.820 --> 33:15.020
You and I both know what's under that fountain.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.260
You're in this now.

33:17.380 --> 33:19.230
We're both in it.

33:19.850 --> 33:21.420
Understand?

33:28.260 --> 33:30.110
Don't worry, darling.

33:30.810 --> 33:32.890
It's almost over.

33:47.540 --> 33:48.429
I can't do it.

33:48.430 --> 33:50.039
Oh, mr. Monk, come on. I can't.

33:50.040 --> 33:52.629
Please. Look, there's the captain's cane.

33:52.630 --> 33:53.569
Yeah, it's part of the ritual,

33:53.570 --> 33:54.829
Because he didn't need it anymore.

33:54.830 --> 33:56.180
Please drink.

34:05.710 --> 34:06.689
Natelie...

34:06.690 --> 34:07.869
What? What is it?

34:07.870 --> 34:09.340
These pills.

34:10.100 --> 34:13.540
Half the bottles-- more than half--

34:14.310 --> 34:16.710
Are from the same pharmacy.

34:17.590 --> 34:19.630
There's something wrong here.

34:20.540 --> 34:22.239
Just put this in your bag.

34:22.730 --> 34:24.810
Let's take some more.

34:25.790 --> 34:27.120
What are you doing?

34:27.130 --> 34:27.949
I'm sorry, ma'am.

34:27.949 --> 34:29.699
I'm afraid you have to stay back.

34:29.699 --> 34:30.549
This may be

34:30.550 --> 34:32.199
A crime scene. A crime scene?

34:32.199 --> 34:34.289
Conspiracy. Probably fraud.

34:34.290 --> 34:35.879
It isn't fraud. It was murder.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.389
this has gone long enough

34:37.389 --> 34:38.759
It wasn't me.

34:38.760 --> 34:40.688
I didn't even know him then.

34:40.690 --> 34:43.918
Nine years ago, my fiance caught his business partner

34:43.920 --> 34:46.359
Stealing money, and killed him.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.849
Your fiance?

34:47.850 --> 34:49.659
Owen mccloskey.

34:49.929 --> 34:52.130
He filled those prescriptions.

34:55.130 --> 34:57.180
The pharmacist.

35:54.900 --> 35:55.809
Captain.

35:55.810 --> 35:56.919
Captain.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.509
Captain, you can't go to spain--

35:58.510 --> 36:00.060
Without knowing the truth.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.110
It wasn't a miracle.

36:05.130 --> 36:08.749
The water, the fountain, it was all a hoax.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.099
I'm sorry, captain.

36:10.100 --> 36:12.549
It was the pharmacist, owen mccloskey.

36:12.550 --> 36:14.430
He killed willie t.

36:22.210 --> 36:25.099
Here's what happened

36:25.100 --> 36:32.639
Mccloskey killed his partner and buried him here.

36:32.640 --> 36:36.549
Nine years later, planning to renovate

36:36.549 --> 36:42.349
Body would be discovered

36:42.350 --> 36:46.499
he couldn't dig up the body

36:46.500 --> 36:50.869
they had built a fountain there

36:50.870 --> 36:55.200
he had to stop them from digging

36:56.430 --> 37:00.329
he started changing their prescriptions

37:00.330 --> 37:04.829
to make his patients sicker

37:04.830 --> 37:08.589
that's why you never got better

37:08.590 --> 37:12.070
he did it to everyone

37:12.340 --> 37:15.749
he painted that sign on your door

37:15.750 --> 37:21.030
Willie the bum must have seen him

37:22.270 --> 37:26.070
that's why Mccloskey killed him

37:26.070 --> 37:29.070
Amen

37:35.500 --> 37:38.619
So he was messing with everybody's medication.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.529
Making us all sicker.

37:40.530 --> 37:43.019
And then he sent us to that fountain.

37:43.020 --> 37:44.279
That's it.

37:44.280 --> 37:46.459
So after we drank,

37:46.460 --> 37:49.110
He'd give us some real medication.

37:50.940 --> 37:53.059
Making us all feel better.

37:53.060 --> 37:54.350
And it worked.

37:54.390 --> 37:56.349
The fountain became a shrine,

37:56.350 --> 37:57.839
A sacred place.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.590
Which, of course, they would never dig up.

38:04.170 --> 38:06.760
Well, so much for miracles.

38:19.350 --> 38:20.939
Thank you, mr. Monk.

38:20.940 --> 38:23.640
This is the best christmas I can remember.

38:23.640 --> 38:24.959
Yeah. I was just doing my job.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.249
No, it wasn't just that.

38:26.250 --> 38:27.449
Thanks for the caring.

38:27.450 --> 38:29.279
Well, the caring part was mostly natalie.

38:29.280 --> 38:32.190
We, uh, we wanted to give you something.

38:32.290 --> 38:33.920
We made it ourselves.

38:34.210 --> 38:35.610
It's gravy.

38:36.460 --> 38:37.629
I can't take that.

38:37.630 --> 38:38.589
No, we insist.

38:38.590 --> 38:39.809
After all you've done for us.

38:39.810 --> 38:41.349
No, no, no, he means he literally can't take it.

38:41.350 --> 38:43.279
I got it, though. Thank you so much.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.169
Merry christmas.

38:44.170 --> 38:45.539
Merry christmas. Merry christmas.

38:45.540 --> 38:46.839
Thank you so much.

38:46.840 --> 38:48.119
Merry christmas.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.840
Merry christmas.

38:51.570 --> 38:53.070
Merry christmas.

38:59.940 --> 39:01.659
Mccloskey's already talking.

39:01.660 --> 39:03.990
We're digging up the fountain tomorrow too.

39:05.590 --> 39:07.440
I'm sorry you had to go through all that.

39:07.860 --> 39:09.030
I'm not.

39:10.100 --> 39:11.430
How's that?

39:11.750 --> 39:13.340
I'm not sorry.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.019
I know it's all a hoax.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.309
I know it's a big con game.

39:17.310 --> 39:18.460
But...

39:19.480 --> 39:21.080
It felt real.

39:21.410 --> 39:22.399
That's all I can say.

39:22.400 --> 39:23.609
Randy, when I drank that water,

39:23.610 --> 39:24.469
Something happened.

39:24.470 --> 39:26.759
It was like a slate inside me was wiped clean

39:26.760 --> 39:28.700
And I started over.

39:30.810 --> 39:32.580
It felt great.

39:35.070 --> 39:36.159
Hey, you know what I'm gonna do?

39:36.160 --> 39:37.469
I'm gonna call my son.

39:37.470 --> 39:39.430
Oh, no, no, hang on. Wait a minute.

39:39.580 --> 39:41.610
Um, I almost forgot.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.970
This is for you.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.560
Merry christmas.

39:52.150 --> 39:53.469
Jared, hey!

39:53.470 --> 39:55.440
I was just about to call you.

39:58.170 --> 39:59.760
Yeah, I love you too.

39:59.810 --> 40:01.069
It's a razor.

40:01.070 --> 40:02.629
Is this for me?

40:02.630 --> 40:03.830
Shave it.

40:04.330 --> 40:05.419
Oh, i--

40:05.420 --> 40:07.250
Oh, I'd love to see you.

40:07.730 --> 40:08.739
I'm--i--

40:08.740 --> 40:10.440
I'm free all weekend.

40:11.260 --> 40:12.699
That'd be great.

40:12.700 --> 40:14.719
What if I grow a little goatee instead?

40:14.720 --> 40:15.589
No.

40:15.590 --> 40:17.129
Uh, friday, uh, friday, yeah.

40:17.130 --> 40:18.779
Friday night, I'll pick you up at the airport.

40:18.780 --> 40:20.549
What about sideburns? I could do sideburns.

40:20.550 --> 40:22.429
Like, probably down to the bottom of my ear, I bet.

40:22.430 --> 40:23.519
Mutton chops. No.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.689
Hey, look, um, friday night,

40:25.690 --> 40:26.859
I'll meet you at the airport.

40:26.860 --> 40:27.499
Soul patch.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.009
I can do a soul patch right there.

40:29.010 --> 40:32.250
Really? Wh--wh--what's her name?

40:33.120 --> 40:34.039
Awesome.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.650
I mean, that-- that's great.

40:35.950 --> 40:37.180
Cool.

40:39.570 --> 40:40.890
I'll meet you in the car.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
