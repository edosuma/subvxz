WEBVTT

00:26.753 --> 00:28.487
My name is Alexis.

00:30.923 --> 00:32.825
And when I hear certain sounds,

00:34.459 --> 00:36.428
I don't just hear them,

00:38.463 --> 00:40.499
I see them.

00:40.532 --> 00:43.368
And the very first time
it happened,

00:44.603 --> 00:46.973
my whole life changed.

02:14.861 --> 02:17.063
Always ready to help.

02:17.096 --> 02:18.597
Dad injured?

02:18.630 --> 02:19.664
Well...

02:20.867 --> 02:23.468
He's fine, right?

02:23.501 --> 02:25.738
Well, physically, yes,

02:25.771 --> 02:30.076
but it hasn't been easy for him.

02:30.109 --> 02:36.148
War is like living
through a brutal accident.

02:36.182 --> 02:38.617
Remember your accident?

02:38.650 --> 02:40.052
That's not the same.

02:40.086 --> 02:41.787
I lost my hearing.

02:41.821 --> 02:46.893
Sweetie,
he needs to feel your love.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.967
Just be careful, please.

03:47.019 --> 03:49.088
Man,
I wish Jordan can come back,

03:49.121 --> 03:50.222
we're getting killed.

03:58.064 --> 04:00.632
Can we go catch a game?

04:07.306 --> 04:09.809
Or just wait
for another Space Jam.

04:23.189 --> 04:24.589
...either.

04:26.258 --> 04:27.659
Go to your room.

04:27.692 --> 04:31.063
You all bore him.

04:31.097 --> 04:35.533
At least, me losing my hearing
means I can't hear you.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.635
Kevin, tell your sister
to look at me.

04:40.039 --> 04:43.275
Do what your mother tells you.

04:43.309 --> 04:45.643
Dad.

04:47.679 --> 04:50.182
Do what your mother tells you.

04:50.216 --> 04:53.551
I can't hear you.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.954
Do as your mother tells you!

04:56.654 --> 04:58.824
Do what your mother tells you,
baby.

05:05.831 --> 05:08.167
Sorry, honey.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.769
Moody soon-to-be-teen.

05:14.774 --> 05:15.975
Welcome home.

08:52.491 --> 08:56.462
Hey, are you okay?

08:56.495 --> 08:58.264
I knew that people
would never understand

08:58.297 --> 09:01.267
what I saw or felt,

09:01.300 --> 09:03.969
but all I could think of

09:04.003 --> 09:06.472
was that I needed
to feel it again.

09:19.051 --> 09:22.087
The heartbeat of your work.

09:22.121 --> 09:24.223
I find percussions and drums

09:24.256 --> 09:26.959
to be the bridge
of musical science.

09:26.992 --> 09:31.430
It is the human touch elevated
to a language.

09:31.463 --> 09:34.900
Sounds carry messages

09:34.933 --> 09:37.503
and percussions do that.

09:37.536 --> 09:38.904
And a beat, by the way,

09:38.937 --> 09:40.406
doesn't only come
from instruments,

09:40.439 --> 09:42.041
a beat can come from anywhere.

09:42.074 --> 09:44.410
Like how a heartbeat
is a melody,

09:44.443 --> 09:48.080
each surface has its own tune.

09:51.650 --> 09:54.420
Mr. Bell will be back next week.

09:54.453 --> 09:56.221
We'll resume
our compositions then.

10:12.104 --> 10:14.606
Got you, okay.

10:17.676 --> 10:19.044
Hi.

10:28.921 --> 10:30.155
Yeah!

10:30.189 --> 10:31.290
Hey, roomie.

10:31.323 --> 10:34.293
Sorry, I'm late.

10:35.127 --> 10:36.328
Oh, yes.

10:36.929 --> 10:38.964
Tonight's gonna be dope.

10:38.997 --> 10:39.932
Mmhmm.

10:39.965 --> 10:41.133
You are one sick puppy,
did you know that?

10:41.166 --> 10:41.667
Yeah.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.634
Mmhmm.

10:42.668 --> 10:43.969
I got the mixer, let me get it.

10:44.002 --> 10:44.903
Okay.

10:46.071 --> 10:47.306
Hmm.

10:53.679 --> 10:54.580
Nope.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.416
No snooping
at my Frankenstein project.

10:57.449 --> 10:58.484
What are you talking about?

10:58.517 --> 11:00.686
This looks awesome.

11:01.987 --> 11:04.456
Anyway, the mixer.

11:04.490 --> 11:06.592
Or as a French would call it
<i>"la table de mixage".</i>

11:06.625 --> 11:09.161
Oh, I learn something new
every day.

11:09.194 --> 11:10.396
Mmhmm.

11:10.429 --> 11:12.431
Uh, that little mixer
is really effective.

11:12.464 --> 11:13.365
Yeah.

11:13.399 --> 11:15.033
Modeled it so that every channel

11:15.067 --> 11:16.702
can be separately recorded
in raw formats.

11:16.736 --> 11:17.503
Yes.

11:17.536 --> 11:19.037
Yeah.

11:19.071 --> 11:21.473
I'll grab the rest
of my favorite wires.

11:21.507 --> 11:22.107
Hell yeah.

11:22.141 --> 11:22.608
Uh, huh-huh.

11:23.609 --> 11:25.577
And your weird little experiment
deserves it.

11:25.611 --> 11:26.945
Okay.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.147
I'll see you at 7:00.

11:28.180 --> 11:29.214
Okay.

11:29.248 --> 11:31.550
Uh.

11:36.054 --> 11:37.456
No.

11:37.489 --> 11:38.991
No, uh.

11:49.401 --> 11:50.169
Hey, how's it goin'?

11:50.202 --> 11:51.103
Hi.

11:51.136 --> 11:53.238
Thanks, good.

11:53.272 --> 11:54.573
Yeah.

11:54.606 --> 11:56.008
I think it works.

11:56.041 --> 11:58.544
Everything works, yeah, yeah.

12:08.020 --> 12:11.056
So if you have any problems
at all, then just bring it back

12:11.089 --> 12:13.225
and we'll open it up
and take a look.

12:13.258 --> 12:16.595
Uh, yeah, it's total, so yeah.

12:22.267 --> 12:23.135
Yeah, sure.

12:24.403 --> 12:25.604
Yeah.

12:43.455 --> 12:45.157
Excuse me?

12:45.190 --> 12:46.225
Can I turn this on?

12:46.258 --> 12:47.359
Yeah.

12:47.392 --> 12:48.594
Do you know how
to work one of those?

12:48.627 --> 12:49.294
Yeah.

12:49.328 --> 12:50.162
Okay, cool.

12:50.195 --> 12:51.563
Just be careful,
it's kind of an oldie.

12:52.297 --> 12:53.232
No problem.

13:38.410 --> 13:39.611
Thank you.

13:39.645 --> 13:40.813
It's funny, people usually go
for <i>Star Trek.</i>

13:40.847 --> 13:43.115
You're a total natural.

13:43.148 --> 13:45.450
Thanks for letting me play.

13:45.484 --> 13:46.151
Have a good day.

13:46.184 --> 13:47.319
You, too.

14:01.901 --> 14:02.869
Okay.

14:04.904 --> 14:05.772
Yeah.

14:07.406 --> 14:08.073
You ready?

14:08.106 --> 14:09.207
Thanks for getting me into this.

14:09.842 --> 14:11.143
Alright.

14:14.914 --> 14:19.117
So where do you
wanna put the camera?

14:19.151 --> 14:19.585
Mm.

14:19.618 --> 14:20.252
Oh.

14:20.285 --> 14:22.688
Uh, no, wse're not filming.

14:22.721 --> 14:23.589
Only sound.

14:23.622 --> 14:26.358
All we need is a table
and some power.

14:26.391 --> 14:28.460
Hmm, alright, just over here.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.162
You can use that table.

14:30.195 --> 14:31.396
Great, thanks.

14:34.232 --> 14:35.200
Okay.

14:45.577 --> 14:47.546
Yeah, it's great.

14:47.579 --> 14:49.381
Okay, we're all set.

14:56.355 --> 14:57.757
We're recording?

14:57.790 --> 14:58.858
Yep.

14:58.891 --> 15:00.359
Alright, over to you.

15:13.572 --> 15:14.741
We need more.

15:15.775 --> 15:19.478
Uh, we need to be able
to hear them properly.

15:19.511 --> 15:21.613
Back in your lane, young lady.

15:21.647 --> 15:23.181
I know what I'm doing.

15:23.215 --> 15:24.683
It'll be loud enough.

15:26.919 --> 15:28.320
Back in your lane, lady.

15:51.978 --> 15:54.379
Keep going, harder.

15:54.413 --> 15:55.748
We're getting close
to his limit.

15:55.782 --> 15:58.350
Please, this is great.

15:58.383 --> 16:00.285
What else can you use?

16:00.318 --> 16:02.855
You remember the signal.

16:15.868 --> 16:17.335
Keep going, please.

16:17.369 --> 16:18.938
Harder.

16:21.339 --> 16:22.474
Harder.

16:22.507 --> 16:23.876
Harder.

16:30.883 --> 16:32.384
Why are you stopping?

16:32.417 --> 16:33.618
That's his limit.

16:33.652 --> 16:34.686
He did the signal.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.288
He's fine, I'm not done.

16:36.321 --> 16:37.857
Dude, he's had enough!

16:37.890 --> 16:38.758
We have plenty of material...

16:38.791 --> 16:41.426
I'll tell you
when I got what I need.

16:43.896 --> 16:45.932
Thank you so much for your time.

16:45.965 --> 16:47.566
We'll get out of your hair
in a minute.

17:37.449 --> 17:40.853
You're still not talkin' to me.

17:40.887 --> 17:42.922
We got people to take part
in your sound experiment,

17:42.955 --> 17:44.489
that's what matters.

17:47.425 --> 17:48.895
What?

17:48.928 --> 17:51.396
It's my fault?

17:51.429 --> 17:54.366
The guy had enough.

17:54.399 --> 17:58.370
These people push themselves,
Marie, that's their shtick.

17:58.403 --> 18:00.472
You didn't let me push them.

18:01.207 --> 18:04.409
Okay, these people have rules,

18:04.442 --> 18:07.379
the most important being
we respect their limits.

18:15.755 --> 18:20.092
Okay, I know you are this
super-experimental rad artist

18:20.126 --> 18:23.361
with sounds
no one has ever heard of,

18:23.395 --> 18:26.766
but you haven't even listened
to it.

18:26.799 --> 18:27.733
Why would I?

18:27.767 --> 18:30.402
I don't think it worked,
I didn't get enough.

18:30.435 --> 18:32.805
Well, that's what you get
with $100

18:32.839 --> 18:34.673
and people from the internet.

18:34.706 --> 18:35.440
I know, okay?

18:35.473 --> 18:39.879
I just...
I need powerful sounds.

18:42.014 --> 18:43.783
Just listen to it.

18:45.117 --> 18:46.085
Come on.

18:48.087 --> 18:48.888
Please.

18:48.921 --> 18:49.856
Fine.

19:17.216 --> 19:17.917
See?

19:18.851 --> 19:20.119
Fig.

19:20.152 --> 19:22.121
I can work with that.

19:22.154 --> 19:22.687
Yeah?

19:22.721 --> 19:25.057
Yeah, you were right.

19:25.091 --> 19:26.558
Thank you.

19:26.591 --> 19:27.692
Thank you.

19:29.795 --> 19:31.864
I couldn't have done it
without you.

19:37.737 --> 19:38.703
I'm so proud of you.

19:38.738 --> 19:40.538
Uh.

19:40.572 --> 19:41.673
Thanks.

19:42.808 --> 19:46.645
Um,
I'm gonna let you get to work.

19:47.512 --> 19:49.815
Let me know
if you need anything.

19:49.849 --> 19:50.883
You know where to find me.

19:50.917 --> 19:52.919
Yes, I should be good.

19:52.952 --> 19:54.020
I'll... I'll see you at home.

19:54.053 --> 19:56.188
Okay.

19:56.222 --> 19:57.957
Oh, can I keep the recorder
for a bit?

19:57.990 --> 19:59.125
Of course.

19:59.158 --> 20:00.192
Thanks.

20:00.226 --> 20:01.227
Okay, see you later.

20:01.260 --> 20:02.594
Bye.

21:06.192 --> 21:08.227
Oh!

22:11.689 --> 22:14.126
Hey, what's up?

22:14.160 --> 22:15.693
What's your problem?

22:15.728 --> 22:16.862
Oh, come on, you're all alone.

22:16.896 --> 22:17.963
Stay the fuck back.

22:18.898 --> 22:19.664
You know what I want?

22:19.697 --> 22:21.767
Fuck off!

23:01.273 --> 23:03.275
Now,
you've got what you wanted.

24:23.122 --> 24:24.123
Good morning.

24:26.325 --> 24:27.760
Is Marie here?

24:27.793 --> 24:29.762
Oh, she's in there.

24:29.795 --> 24:32.131
I'm Duke, by the way.

24:32.164 --> 24:35.167
You want a hit on this?

24:35.201 --> 24:37.069
Alexis.

24:37.102 --> 24:38.270
I'm good.

24:43.175 --> 24:44.777
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:46.545 --> 24:48.747
You just got in, didn't you?

24:49.648 --> 24:51.784
Yeah, pulled an all-nighter.

24:51.817 --> 24:53.852
Yeah, you did.

24:53.886 --> 24:58.524
Uh, sorry, can I still
borrow the recorder and cables?

24:58.557 --> 25:01.193
Yeah, I said it was fine.

25:01.227 --> 25:02.394
Yeah, you did.

25:03.295 --> 25:06.498
Come on,
you just wanted a morning hug.

25:06.532 --> 25:08.067
Love awkward moments.

25:09.301 --> 25:11.437
- Good morning.
- Mm, morning

25:14.940 --> 25:15.441
Go get some rest.

25:15.474 --> 25:16.942
Okay, yeah.

25:18.177 --> 25:19.979
Your wife?

25:22.181 --> 25:25.184
No,
just my bondage party partner.

25:25.217 --> 25:26.819
Coffee?

25:26.852 --> 25:27.519
Yeah.

25:30.522 --> 25:31.457
Wait.

26:45.297 --> 26:46.932
So the sound just stopped

26:46.965 --> 26:48.300
and you lost your hearing again?

26:50.536 --> 26:53.505
Yeah, it was abrupt
and I panicked.

26:53.539 --> 26:55.974
Any idea
what triggered the event?

26:56.008 --> 26:57.376
You tell me.

26:57.409 --> 26:58.610
Well, looking
at the tympanic membrane,

26:58.644 --> 27:00.212
the damage remains the same.

27:00.679 --> 27:02.114
As you know,
when you recovered your hearing,

27:02.147 --> 27:03.515
it was because
the connection somehow resumed,

27:03.549 --> 27:06.318
not the membrane healing,
and it won't.

27:06.352 --> 27:07.219
And you also know

27:07.252 --> 27:10.055
the connections
in there are fragile.

27:10.089 --> 27:14.226
It does mean they can come on
and off a small stimulation.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.594
I told you once you're
approaching 30,

27:15.627 --> 27:17.196
more tests
might become necessary

27:17.229 --> 27:20.532
as things tend to escalate.

27:20.566 --> 27:23.068
This might be
an early warning sign.

28:31.470 --> 28:34.540
Hi.

28:34.573 --> 28:36.275
What's your name?

28:36.308 --> 28:39.077
What the fuck
are you doing here?

28:39.111 --> 28:41.079
This place is no place
for a young girl.

28:43.615 --> 28:47.152
Let me help you, okay?

28:47.186 --> 28:48.654
Are you hungry?

28:49.588 --> 28:50.422
Here.

28:52.224 --> 28:53.225
Eat this.

28:59.431 --> 29:01.099
You're a sweet girl.

29:01.133 --> 29:02.367
They don't let me talk
to sweet girls no more.

29:02.401 --> 29:03.302
It's okay.

29:05.037 --> 29:06.138
Irene?

29:06.739 --> 29:07.639
Just eat.

29:08.140 --> 29:10.142
Just eat, okay?

29:10.175 --> 29:11.376
Just eat.

29:44.076 --> 29:45.544
Let's get you inside.

30:06.866 --> 30:08.801
I can't hear you.

30:08.835 --> 30:10.135
Welcome home.

30:10.168 --> 30:13.405
Do what your mother tells you!

30:13.438 --> 30:15.808
Dad, I can't hear you.

30:32.524 --> 30:34.226
I shouldn't get up.

30:58.717 --> 31:00.385
I need you.

31:00.419 --> 31:01.821
Please, help me.

31:40.893 --> 31:43.695
You know,
I taught a class this week

31:43.730 --> 31:45.932
about how beats are...

31:46.632 --> 31:48.901
A language
to tell stories.

35:19.578 --> 35:21.546
I'm so proud of you.

36:10.963 --> 36:12.697
Oh wow.

37:02.514 --> 37:04.716
Havin' a good day, huh?

37:04.750 --> 37:06.886
Yes, I am.

37:06.919 --> 37:09.221
Where have you been
the past couple of days?

37:09.255 --> 37:13.259
You know, working
and experimenting.

37:13.292 --> 37:15.127
Looks like it's paying off.

37:15.161 --> 37:16.162
Mm, Marie.

37:16.862 --> 37:18.764
I've been stuck for so long,

37:18.798 --> 37:20.699
but I finally
had a breakthrough today.

37:20.733 --> 37:22.567
I am feeling so inspired.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.770
Well, we should celebrate.

37:24.804 --> 37:26.538
Come.

37:26.571 --> 37:30.675
You know that I want to,
but I'm...

37:30.709 --> 37:31.877
I'm in the flow, I'm not yet...

37:31.911 --> 37:34.146
Oh, come on!

37:34.180 --> 37:36.816
There's lots of people out,
people who love you.

37:37.416 --> 37:40.987
There'll be cute guys,
cute girls.

37:41.020 --> 37:41.653
Oh.

37:42.121 --> 37:43.189
One for all.

37:45.324 --> 37:48.828
Flattery will get you anywhere.

37:48.861 --> 37:49.527
Fine.

37:50.763 --> 37:53.199
I mean
after all I've done for you,

37:53.232 --> 37:54.900
you owe me a drink.

37:54.934 --> 37:56.769
Basically, a musical pawn shop.

38:00.373 --> 38:02.041
- Oh.
- Your face.

38:02.074 --> 38:03.675
Oh my God.

38:03.708 --> 38:04.310
Oh.

38:04.343 --> 38:04.944
Fuck you.

38:07.146 --> 38:08.247
Fine.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.216
The first drink is on me,

38:10.249 --> 38:12.318
but then you agree
to come with me

38:12.351 --> 38:15.587
to this club
where I'm playing later.

38:15.620 --> 38:17.790
Shut up, that's awesome!

38:17.823 --> 38:18.924
Yes!

38:18.958 --> 38:22.094
Um, I'm gonna invite Duke, too.

38:22.128 --> 38:22.795
Great.

38:29.135 --> 38:30.568
This is so exciting!

38:31.303 --> 38:32.238
I'm gonna go get drinks, okay?

38:32.271 --> 38:32.938
Cool.

38:32.972 --> 38:33.671
Thanks.

38:33.705 --> 38:34.606
Yeah?

38:37.642 --> 38:38.878
Hey, so I've been meaning to ask

38:38.911 --> 38:42.782
um, Marie says you make these
like dope experimental tracks.

38:42.815 --> 38:46.052
I'm still tryin' to figure out
like my sound.

38:46.085 --> 38:47.719
What's your inspiration?

38:47.753 --> 38:49.255
My family died.

39:47.913 --> 39:48.914
I need you.

40:37.163 --> 40:38.831
Speakers.

40:38.864 --> 40:40.733
Huh?

40:40.766 --> 40:42.868
Those are XLRs

40:42.902 --> 40:45.838
and those are
for speaker cables.

40:45.871 --> 40:47.907
Some drunk hobo nearby said
he heard the music,

40:47.940 --> 40:50.843
only kind of witness.

40:50.876 --> 40:51.977
This place is a wasteland.

40:52.011 --> 40:54.113
It's kind of genius really.

40:54.146 --> 40:55.414
Glad you admire that psycho.

40:55.447 --> 40:56.649
No, I... didn't mean...

40:56.681 --> 40:58.884
Lin, bag tag, get the
team to swab all over again.

40:58.918 --> 41:00.718
Take pics of everything.

41:00.753 --> 41:01.754
Yes, ma'am.

41:03.489 --> 41:07.159
The precision, the overkill.

41:10.396 --> 41:11.897
It's not over.

41:43.095 --> 41:44.496
No scratching!

41:50.102 --> 41:51.837
Fuckin' asshole.

42:49.895 --> 42:51.530
Thank you.

42:51.563 --> 42:53.899
Thanks for your business.

42:53.932 --> 42:56.302
Come again.

42:56.335 --> 42:59.204
Okay, so that is why I wanted
to talk about synesthesia.

42:59.238 --> 43:01.573
If someone is able to see
sound,

43:01.607 --> 43:04.576
then it's no longer just
an auditory experience, right?

43:04.610 --> 43:08.480
It becomes something deeper,
more profound,

43:08.514 --> 43:10.616
more connected
to the world around us.

43:10.649 --> 43:12.351
Are you about to levitate,
Mr. Bell?

43:14.887 --> 43:15.888
Uh, no.

43:15.921 --> 43:17.089
No, actually, I'll wait
till the next lecture

43:17.122 --> 43:19.258
do that for you.

43:19.291 --> 43:22.027
Uh, alright,
so in the last 10 minutes

43:22.061 --> 43:24.396
or so that we have left
I wanna talk about an email

43:24.430 --> 43:27.266
that I got from someone
who will remain anonymous.

43:27.299 --> 43:31.003
Uh, last week apparently,
Alexis talked about beat making

43:31.036 --> 43:33.172
as a form
of human communication,

43:33.205 --> 43:34.373
human language, right?

43:34.406 --> 43:35.374
Yep.

43:35.407 --> 43:38.310
Maybe we could
turn the class over to Alexis

43:38.344 --> 43:40.179
and let her finish her lecture.

43:42.514 --> 43:44.249
- Alexis?
- Hmm?

43:44.283 --> 43:45.517
You wanna take over
and finish your lecture?

43:45.551 --> 43:46.485
Oh, sure.

43:46.518 --> 43:47.586
Great.

43:47.619 --> 43:49.588
Um, I'm not prepared.

43:49.621 --> 43:51.056
No, you'll do great.

43:51.090 --> 43:52.324
- I get to sit.
- But... sure.

43:52.358 --> 43:55.561
Okay, um, help me out, guys.

43:55.594 --> 43:56.995
My job might be on the line.

43:57.963 --> 43:58.430
It is.

44:02.368 --> 44:02.935
You know what?

44:02.968 --> 44:05.904
Let's try something else.

44:05.938 --> 44:08.440
I'm going to play you guys
something experimental

44:08.474 --> 44:10.442
that I've been working on.

44:10.476 --> 44:12.211
Alright, let's give it a listen,
guys.

44:54.219 --> 44:55.320
What the fuck?

44:55.354 --> 44:57.456
Are those animals
being slaughtered?

44:57.489 --> 44:58.290
Alright, alright, thank you.

44:58.323 --> 45:00.125
Everybody,
thanks for your feedback.

45:00.159 --> 45:01.593
Let's just stop for a second.

45:01.627 --> 45:04.731
Alexis, can you turn that off,
please?

45:04.764 --> 45:06.598
Can you please stop and...
and sorry, but what...

45:08.133 --> 45:09.101
What on Earth was that?

45:09.134 --> 45:09.968
Yeah, okay, I understand

45:10.002 --> 45:11.437
that might be
a little bit different

45:11.470 --> 45:13.672
than what you guys
have heard before.

45:13.705 --> 45:15.307
Is this a joke?

45:15.340 --> 45:17.543
No, look, let me explain.

45:17.576 --> 45:18.677
What's wrong with you?

46:07.092 --> 46:07.659
Hey, babe, are you home?

46:07.693 --> 46:09.061
Are you okay?

46:11.163 --> 46:13.432
Phew, okay.

46:16.668 --> 46:19.137
<i>Hey, you've reached
Alexis, leave a message.</i>

46:19.171 --> 46:22.140
Hey, babe um, I heard
what happened in class.

46:22.174 --> 46:24.076
Students are fucking jerks.

46:24.109 --> 46:27.713
Um, call me back
when you get this please, okay?

46:27.747 --> 46:29.248
Bye.

47:12.391 --> 47:14.426
Yes!

47:17.362 --> 47:19.832
Hi.

47:19.866 --> 47:21.099
You're the person

47:21.133 --> 47:23.235
who put the note
on the noticeboard

47:23.268 --> 47:26.138
for a... for a tenor singer?

47:26.171 --> 47:26.873
I'm Jarod.

47:26.906 --> 47:28.407
Hi.

47:28.440 --> 47:30.242
Oh, I'm so glad you found it.

47:30.275 --> 47:32.344
I was worried no one
was gonna come.

47:32.377 --> 47:33.412
So uh, what is it?

47:33.445 --> 47:35.147
What's the pay?

47:35.180 --> 47:39.151
Uh, 100 bucks, couple hours max,
testing material.

47:39.184 --> 47:41.186
We are going
to explore your range.

47:41.219 --> 47:42.254
Cool.

47:42.287 --> 47:44.289
Left some food for the cat,
so I'm good on time.

47:44.323 --> 47:44.723
Sweet.

47:44.757 --> 47:47.526
150.

47:47.559 --> 47:48.226
Oh.

47:48.260 --> 47:51.831
Uh, let's see.

47:51.864 --> 47:56.401
That's 100 and...

47:56.435 --> 47:58.704
...31, 2... 132.

48:03.275 --> 48:05.143
Alright.

48:05.177 --> 48:07.145
Great.

48:07.179 --> 48:07.914
Where do you want me?

48:07.947 --> 48:10.349
Head into the booth, please.

48:10.382 --> 48:12.250
Close the door.

48:12.284 --> 48:14.186
And don't worry
about headphones.

48:18.825 --> 48:20.860
Alright, go ahead, warm up,
vocalize

48:20.893 --> 48:23.161
you know,
whatever your routine is.

48:23.195 --> 48:26.866
Oh, well, I like to vocalize
to our national anthem.

48:29.635 --> 48:30.636

49:36.268 --> 49:40.305
They will record the music
as it travels through you.

49:40.338 --> 49:44.977
Your emotions, your energy,
it'll capture all of that.

49:45.011 --> 49:46.012
Never heard of that.

49:46.678 --> 49:47.512
Okay.

49:47.546 --> 49:48.680
Can I put these on you?

49:48.714 --> 49:49.614
Sure.

49:53.820 --> 49:56.789
Okay, so this is gonna go
on your temple.

49:56.823 --> 49:58.356

50:10.302 --> 50:11.771
Hey, I should charge you
extra for this, you know?

50:11.804 --> 50:12.772
What?

50:12.805 --> 50:15.307
I should charge you extra
for this, you know?

50:17.409 --> 50:19.812
That's not a joke.

50:19.846 --> 50:22.380
Do you know Amazing Grace?

50:23.715 --> 50:25.918
I'm serious.

50:25.952 --> 50:28.420
Yeah, I mean, who doesn't?

50:28.453 --> 50:30.689
Uh, fun memories.

50:34.526 --> 50:36.561
My brother was so whiny,

50:36.595 --> 50:39.431
like every time he was sick,
he would not shut up

50:39.464 --> 50:41.734
until I sang it to him.

50:41.768 --> 50:42.969
Oh, that's really sweet.

50:44.003 --> 50:45.905
Music heals all, right?

50:45.938 --> 50:48.007
Oh, no, no, no, he did it
to put me on show

50:48.040 --> 50:49.341
in front of our mom.

50:50.509 --> 50:51.676
Conniving little cunt.

50:53.913 --> 50:57.950

52:08.855 --> 52:12.091
There's a electrical feedback
happening on this...

52:12.124 --> 52:14.026
Keep singing, Jarod.

52:14.060 --> 52:15.061
Hey, can you...

52:15.094 --> 52:17.029
Can you get me out
of this thing?

52:17.063 --> 52:17.830
Hey, fucking...

52:18.731 --> 52:20.665
Trust the experiment,
keep singing.

52:21.433 --> 52:23.769
Hey, what is this fucking glue?

52:24.669 --> 52:26.705
Fuckin' bitch,
turn this fuck thing o...

53:49.956 --> 53:50.990
So what have we got?

53:51.023 --> 53:52.091
His head exploded.

53:52.124 --> 53:53.893
Took two dozen shots
of various residues on the walls

53:53.926 --> 53:54.726
and floor.

53:54.760 --> 53:56.762
The victim's name
is Jarod Korkansky

53:56.796 --> 53:59.098
according to an expired
driver's license in his wallet.

53:59.131 --> 54:00.632
e's a record store owner.

54:00.665 --> 54:02.667
How does a head explode?

54:02.701 --> 54:03.468
Not sure.

54:03.501 --> 54:05.271
Those electrodes,
they're all over.

54:05.304 --> 54:07.672
Some attached to debris
and some to him.

54:07.706 --> 54:09.141
Not connected
to anything, though.

54:09.175 --> 54:10.608
Forensics?

54:10.642 --> 54:12.244
The whole soundboard
was doused in bleach.

54:12.278 --> 54:14.512
I'm surprised
it didn't catch fire.

54:14.546 --> 54:16.514
So we got nothing.

54:16.548 --> 54:17.883
I'm sending all DNA samples
to the lab.

54:17.917 --> 54:21.220
We'll see if any
don't match the victim.

54:21.253 --> 54:23.289
Great, I won't hold my breath.

54:23.322 --> 54:25.523
Something to do
with the factory?

54:25.557 --> 54:26.691
Definitely.

54:47.813 --> 54:49.115
Hello?

54:56.688 --> 54:58.157
Where are you?

55:03.229 --> 55:03.896
Hi!

55:03.929 --> 55:05.164
Oh!

55:05.197 --> 55:07.665
Hi, what are you doing here?

55:07.699 --> 55:10.702
Um, I was in the neighborhood

55:10.736 --> 55:12.637
and I thought maybe you wanted
to get some lunch.

55:15.307 --> 55:17.109
I can't.

55:17.143 --> 55:18.144
Sorry.

55:36.962 --> 55:38.831
Are you sure it's healthy

55:38.864 --> 55:40.800
for you to be spending
this much time here?

55:45.137 --> 55:47.973
It's fine.

55:48.007 --> 55:51.210
If you don't mind I really need
to get back to work.

55:55.414 --> 55:57.883
Okay, I'm just... I'm...
I'm really worried about you.

55:57.917 --> 55:59.151
You haven't texted me back,

55:59.185 --> 56:01.787
you haven't been home
in two days.

56:01.821 --> 56:03.022
Well, I'm fine.

56:03.055 --> 56:04.056
You're fine?

56:04.090 --> 56:05.858
Yeah, seriously, I'm fine.

56:05.891 --> 56:07.059
I really need to get back to it.

56:07.093 --> 56:08.227
I'll see you later.

56:10.029 --> 56:12.131
I'm gonna be out late tonight,
so lock the door.

56:16.135 --> 56:17.870
Okay, I'm gonna be out, too.

56:17.903 --> 56:19.038
With Duke?

56:21.040 --> 56:22.108
Why don't you like him?

56:22.141 --> 56:23.742
It's not like we're serious.

56:28.848 --> 56:31.750
Okay.

56:31.784 --> 56:32.952
Bye then.

57:17.129 --> 57:18.464
What's up?

57:18.497 --> 57:19.932
Hey.

57:19.965 --> 57:21.000
Hey, I'm surprised you called.

57:21.033 --> 57:21.934
I thought you were busy.

57:21.967 --> 57:22.768
I'm glad I did.

57:22.801 --> 57:24.103
You seem enthralled
by the works.

57:24.136 --> 57:24.904
Yeah.

57:24.937 --> 57:26.071
I need a mortgage
for one of those.

57:26.105 --> 57:27.139
I'm here to support a friend,

57:27.173 --> 57:30.242
but I'd much rather
spend the evening with you.

57:30.276 --> 57:31.944
Oh, so this is a date?

57:31.977 --> 57:33.312
Well.

57:40.386 --> 57:41.754
What's that you're drinking?

57:41.787 --> 57:42.888
This is a pinot noir.

57:43.122 --> 57:44.290
Oh.

57:44.323 --> 57:46.192
Well, garçon, I'll have
a pinot noir, s'il vous plaît.

57:46.225 --> 57:47.760
Oh, lady of the world.

58:00.372 --> 58:02.775
So no bondage party partner
tonight?

58:02.808 --> 58:04.210
Uh, no.

58:04.243 --> 58:07.947
She's working,
so... yeah.

58:07.980 --> 58:09.114
But she seems nice.

58:09.148 --> 58:13.052
Yeah, she's my little weirdo.

58:27.199 --> 58:29.235
She mentioned something to me
about like her family dying.

58:31.837 --> 58:34.006
Yeah, um...

58:34.607 --> 58:35.774
It's fucking horrible.

58:35.808 --> 58:36.942
She was like 10

58:36.976 --> 58:41.780
and all she has left is this RV
and a garage downtown.

58:41.814 --> 58:43.048
Fuck me.

58:43.082 --> 58:45.384
That's dark.

58:46.418 --> 58:47.820
I need more wine.

58:48.387 --> 58:50.256
Yes, me, too!

58:50.289 --> 58:52.124
Sorry, that was really loud.

58:52.157 --> 58:54.293
Um, a bottle please, quickly.

58:54.326 --> 58:55.394
Okay.

59:03.002 --> 59:03.969
Bad luck.

59:06.472 --> 59:08.841
Um, sorry, I'm gonna be back
in like two minutes.

59:08.874 --> 59:10.109
Oh, okay.

59:13.178 --> 59:14.179
Okay.

59:39.305 --> 59:40.906
Hey, sorry,
I need like two more minutes.

59:40.939 --> 59:41.807
He's being a stickler.

59:41.840 --> 59:43.375
I'm really trying
to get my hands on that.

59:43.409 --> 59:44.977
Okay, go for it.

1:01:08.093 --> 1:01:09.528
Somebody do something!

1:01:09.561 --> 1:01:10.562
Stop scaring him!

1:01:38.257 --> 1:01:39.725
Jesus Christ.

1:01:39.759 --> 1:01:41.093
I don't know why you're
standing here,

1:01:41.126 --> 1:01:43.061
get out of the way!

1:01:43.095 --> 1:01:44.196
Oh.

1:01:44.229 --> 1:01:45.664
Oh my God.

1:01:48.434 --> 1:01:50.102
Oh my God, oh my God.

1:01:51.637 --> 1:01:52.638
Somebody call 911!

1:01:52.671 --> 1:01:54.373
What the fuck are you doing?

1:02:02.481 --> 1:02:04.516
That's it for now.

1:02:04.550 --> 1:02:07.453
If you remember anything else,
please contact me.

1:02:09.621 --> 1:02:13.992
Uh, can I go now?

1:02:14.026 --> 1:02:15.694
Can we drive you anywhere?

1:02:15.727 --> 1:02:18.530
No, I'm gonna walk.

1:02:18.564 --> 1:02:19.531
Thanks.

1:02:19.565 --> 1:02:22.501
Please call me
even if you just need to talk.

1:02:24.169 --> 1:02:26.238
Okay, thanks.

1:02:41.019 --> 1:02:42.521
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:02:53.532 --> 1:02:55.467
What a fucking date, huh?

1:02:59.605 --> 1:03:03.408
Did the cops make you feel
like a fucking suspect?

1:03:03.442 --> 1:03:05.344
Yeah, a bit.

1:03:07.679 --> 1:03:09.414
They have to do that
with everyone I guess.

1:03:09.448 --> 1:03:12.184
It's like
just rule out the possibilities.

1:03:19.291 --> 1:03:22.762
Did you see Alexis in there?

1:03:22.795 --> 1:03:24.263
What?

1:03:24.296 --> 1:03:27.499
I don't know what I saw,
it was crazy,

1:03:27.533 --> 1:03:30.068
but I saw a girl
by the fire escape

1:03:30.102 --> 1:03:33.238
like staring at the harpist.

1:03:33.272 --> 1:03:34.807
Looked like her.

1:03:34.841 --> 1:03:36.341
Did you say this shit
to the cops?

1:03:36.375 --> 1:03:38.210
No, of course, I didn't.

1:03:38.243 --> 1:03:41.113
'Cause you
can't unsay that shit.

1:03:41.146 --> 1:03:42.447
I mean we were drinking wine,

1:03:42.481 --> 1:03:44.616
we were talking
about her family being murdered,

1:03:44.650 --> 1:03:47.619
maybe you were projecting,
but that shit's fucking nuts,

1:03:47.653 --> 1:03:49.221
you can't fucking say that.

1:03:49.254 --> 1:03:51.657
What were you saying?

1:03:51.690 --> 1:03:52.825
I didn't see her then.

1:03:52.859 --> 1:03:54.493
I couldn't have seen her.

1:03:59.364 --> 1:04:00.165
I gotta go.

1:04:00.198 --> 1:04:02.200
- I gotta go.
- Marie!

1:04:02.234 --> 1:04:03.101
- Marie!
- No.

1:04:03.135 --> 1:04:04.403
- Marie, wait!
- No!

1:04:25.524 --> 1:04:27.125
Clear the scene.

1:04:39.739 --> 1:04:41.440
Lin, pictures.

1:04:54.319 --> 1:04:55.788
Bag.

1:06:03.990 --> 1:06:05.323
Mornin'!

1:06:05.357 --> 1:06:06.558
What are you doin' up so early?

1:06:06.591 --> 1:06:09.394
I heard some noise and...

1:06:09.428 --> 1:06:10.863
What's wrong?

1:06:10.897 --> 1:06:12.865
Are you okay?

1:06:12.899 --> 1:06:13.866
It was horrible.

1:06:13.900 --> 1:06:16.368
What happened?

1:06:16.401 --> 1:06:22.008
I went to this art gallery
opening with Duke last night,

1:06:22.041 --> 1:06:25.310
and there was this...
this harpist, and she like...

1:06:27.446 --> 1:06:31.349
She like cut her fingers
and her arms on the strings.

1:06:31.383 --> 1:06:33.019
That's insane.

1:06:33.052 --> 1:06:34.386
Are you okay?

1:06:34.419 --> 1:06:35.620
And it was a panic.

1:06:35.654 --> 1:06:36.722
There was blood everywhere,

1:06:36.756 --> 1:06:37.824
and Duke and I were
the only people

1:06:37.857 --> 1:06:39.759
who were helping her.

1:06:39.792 --> 1:06:40.960
Fuck.

1:06:46.799 --> 1:06:49.035
You weren't there last night,
were you?

1:06:49.068 --> 1:06:52.939
I know it sounds crazy,
but...

1:06:52.972 --> 1:06:54.774
Duke said he saw you
in the crowd

1:06:54.807 --> 1:06:58.543
and I told him he was
a fuckin' lunatic, but...

1:07:00.712 --> 1:07:03.415
Um,
I don't think he's a lunatic,

1:07:03.448 --> 1:07:05.051
but I was not there.

1:07:05.084 --> 1:07:06.351
No.

1:07:07.754 --> 1:07:09.822
My RV and my shitty salad

1:07:09.856 --> 1:07:11.590
did not feel
like a fancy gallery opening,

1:07:11.623 --> 1:07:12.859
that's for sure.

1:07:15.560 --> 1:07:16.361
I...

1:07:18.765 --> 1:07:21.000
How do you get it out
of your head?

1:07:23.502 --> 1:07:24.737
I don't know.

1:07:24.771 --> 1:07:26.271
I wish I did.

1:07:27.740 --> 1:07:29.541
I just really
don't wanna be alone right now.

1:07:29.574 --> 1:07:31.744
Okay, come here.

1:07:36.348 --> 1:07:36.983
Oh.

1:07:37.016 --> 1:07:38.283
It's okay.

1:07:39.584 --> 1:07:42.354
I'm sorry.

1:07:42.387 --> 1:07:44.689
It's... you're fine.

1:07:44.723 --> 1:07:45.892
I'm such a mess.

1:07:45.925 --> 1:07:46.725
Stop.

1:07:49.461 --> 1:07:49.996
There you go.

1:07:52.664 --> 1:07:55.001
Ugh, Duke.

1:07:58.370 --> 1:07:59.906
He's saying
he can't sleep either,

1:07:59.939 --> 1:08:02.742
he's so sorry, blah, blah, blah.

1:08:05.778 --> 1:08:09.048
Wow, he heard that she survived.

1:08:11.751 --> 1:08:12.517
Oh my God.

1:08:12.551 --> 1:08:13.552
What a relief.

1:08:15.487 --> 1:08:17.857
I wanna get some more...
some more hot water.

1:08:17.890 --> 1:08:19.457
I'm going.

1:08:20.458 --> 1:08:21.726
Fuck.

1:08:54.559 --> 1:08:56.428
God, I'm so tired.

1:08:56.461 --> 1:08:58.463
You should take a nap.

1:08:58.496 --> 1:09:00.066
You know, I have an idea.

1:09:00.099 --> 1:09:02.701
I have to run a few errands
for Mr. Bell, okay,

1:09:02.735 --> 1:09:06.973
and then I'll pick up some food,
and we can watch a movie,

1:09:07.006 --> 1:09:08.975
and in the meantime
just get some sleep, okay?

1:09:09.008 --> 1:09:09.809
No, I'd like to come.

1:09:09.842 --> 1:09:12.011
No, it's okay,
I'll be right back.

1:09:17.016 --> 1:09:17.783
See you later.

1:09:18.450 --> 1:09:19.185
Okay.

1:09:37.770 --> 1:09:40.106
Hey, Duke.

1:09:40.139 --> 1:09:42.540
What are you doin' here?

1:09:42.574 --> 1:09:43.843
Marie, text me.

1:09:46.544 --> 1:09:48.114
Oh, okay.

1:09:48.147 --> 1:09:50.116
She actually just fell asleep
in my RV.

1:09:53.052 --> 1:09:56.856
She's... she's really shook
after what happened last night.

1:09:59.892 --> 1:10:00.725
Yeah.

1:10:01.928 --> 1:10:03.628
Look, last night was fucked up.

1:10:06.832 --> 1:10:10.036
I do really care
about Marie, though.

1:10:13.239 --> 1:10:15.707
She really needs us right now.

1:10:18.844 --> 1:10:21.113
I'm really glad you came.

1:10:36.829 --> 1:10:39.131
Marie told me about this place.

1:10:39.165 --> 1:10:39.999
It's cool.

1:10:43.702 --> 1:10:45.271
Fuck!

1:11:10.129 --> 1:11:11.529
I don't wanna do this.

1:11:12.732 --> 1:11:14.300
This was not part of my plan.

1:11:15.434 --> 1:11:19.171
But I will not let you stop me
from completing it.

1:11:38.257 --> 1:11:40.159
Fuck you!

1:11:48.134 --> 1:11:49.835
It won't be for nothing.

1:11:52.938 --> 1:11:54.572
You made me do this.

1:14:08.774 --> 1:14:10.442
Thank you.

1:14:50.849 --> 1:14:52.484
Hey, babe, you back?

1:16:00.519 --> 1:16:01.854
Ugh.

1:16:05.124 --> 1:16:06.492
What the fuck.

1:16:16.935 --> 1:16:17.369
Hi.

1:16:17.403 --> 1:16:19.605
Hi.

1:16:19.638 --> 1:16:23.542
Oh shit, sorry, I got swamped.

1:16:23.575 --> 1:16:26.278
It's okay.

1:16:26.312 --> 1:16:27.479
Are those new?

1:16:27.513 --> 1:16:28.314
No.

1:16:28.347 --> 1:16:30.416
They're from my family's
living room.

1:16:30.449 --> 1:16:32.184
- Oh.
- I had them serviced.

1:16:32.217 --> 1:16:33.152
Don't they look good?

1:16:33.185 --> 1:16:34.987
Yeah.

1:16:35.020 --> 1:16:37.890
How are you feeling?

1:16:37.923 --> 1:16:42.061
Uh, better I guess.

1:16:42.094 --> 1:16:44.930
I think it was a relief knowing
that the girl's alive.

1:16:47.900 --> 1:16:48.500
I bet.

1:16:52.237 --> 1:16:54.973
I need to talk to you
about something.

1:16:55.007 --> 1:16:57.309
Over there.

1:16:57.343 --> 1:16:58.444
Okay.

1:17:02.548 --> 1:17:03.515
What's up?

1:17:06.118 --> 1:17:09.021
Okay, um, don't be mad,

1:17:09.054 --> 1:17:11.990
but I went into your room
looking for you,

1:17:12.024 --> 1:17:15.527
and I saw this old iPod
on a nightstand,

1:17:15.561 --> 1:17:17.162
and I thought you know,
maybe your music

1:17:17.196 --> 1:17:18.097
could calm me down.

1:17:21.233 --> 1:17:27.673
But on it was this recording
of a boy being punched

1:17:27.706 --> 1:17:29.942
and it was weird,
and it was like a... a drum beat,

1:17:29.975 --> 1:17:30.943
but on a kid,

1:17:30.976 --> 1:17:35.547
and then there was
this little girl giggling,

1:17:35.581 --> 1:17:39.017
and I thought maybe
that was you.

1:17:39.051 --> 1:17:40.219
I mean it reminded me
of the other night

1:17:40.252 --> 1:17:42.955
with the couple.

1:17:42.988 --> 1:17:44.690
Is that like your thing?

1:17:44.723 --> 1:17:45.357
No.

1:17:46.492 --> 1:17:48.427
The couple was different.

1:17:48.460 --> 1:17:50.562
They were enjoying themselves.

1:17:50.596 --> 1:17:53.298
Yeah, but the little boy wasn't.

1:17:54.400 --> 1:17:55.634
I was young.

1:17:58.437 --> 1:17:59.972
The orphanage
was a fucked up place

1:18:00.005 --> 1:18:05.344
and when kids heard
I killed my dad, they...

1:18:05.377 --> 1:18:07.312
Kids are assholes.

1:18:07.346 --> 1:18:07.980
Yeah.

1:18:08.347 --> 1:18:11.350
And that boy was a bully.

1:18:15.187 --> 1:18:19.258
But you were...
you were enjoying it.

1:18:19.291 --> 1:18:22.361
Yeah, I was

1:18:22.394 --> 1:18:26.064
enacting my revenge
and making music.

1:18:26.098 --> 1:18:27.566
In my young mind,
that was cathartic.

1:18:27.599 --> 1:18:29.067
I was experimenting.

1:18:32.471 --> 1:18:34.406
I'm sorry that happened to you.

1:18:34.440 --> 1:18:35.674
Thanks.

1:18:35.707 --> 1:18:38.310
I'm sorry again

1:18:38.343 --> 1:18:40.112
that I've been so off
with you lately.

1:18:41.046 --> 1:18:42.381
It's okay.

1:18:42.414 --> 1:18:43.615
I just...

1:18:44.784 --> 1:18:46.084
Oh, I missed you.

1:18:46.118 --> 1:18:47.286
I missed you, too.

1:18:50.255 --> 1:18:54.092
I need you
more than you realize.

1:18:54.761 --> 1:18:56.128
Me, too, obviously.

1:18:57.296 --> 1:18:59.064
I mean it.

1:18:59.097 --> 1:19:01.768
I'm not very good
at letting people in.

1:19:01.801 --> 1:19:02.534
I know.

1:19:02.568 --> 1:19:03.402
Shut up.

1:19:04.570 --> 1:19:06.705
I'm just... I'm just...

1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:12.478
I'm so distracted trying
to create and...

1:19:12.511 --> 1:19:17.149
And deliver this music that
has been burning in my soul.

1:19:17.182 --> 1:19:18.584
Mmhmm.

1:19:18.617 --> 1:19:19.786
And with the students,

1:19:19.819 --> 1:19:22.421
and I found out I might be
losing my hearing again, and I...

1:19:22.454 --> 1:19:25.424
Wait, wait, wait, what?

1:19:25.457 --> 1:19:26.658
Yeah.

1:19:26.692 --> 1:19:29.061
Oh my God.

1:19:29.094 --> 1:19:31.096
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

1:19:31.129 --> 1:19:33.031
Thanks.

1:19:33.065 --> 1:19:35.735
Okay, well,
I'm gonna be here with you,

1:19:35.768 --> 1:19:37.236
and we're gonna take care of it,

1:19:37.269 --> 1:19:38.370
we're gonna figure out
what to do.

1:19:38.403 --> 1:19:41.473
It's gonna be okay,
I mean whatever you need, okay?

1:19:41.507 --> 1:19:42.574
Thank you.

1:19:55.187 --> 1:19:56.321
I love you.

1:19:59.725 --> 1:20:02.494
I love you, too.

1:20:02.528 --> 1:20:05.732
I love you, too.

1:20:05.765 --> 1:20:07.432
Oh.

1:20:09.869 --> 1:20:11.503
Oh my God.

1:20:11.537 --> 1:20:13.105
Oh my God.

1:20:18.110 --> 1:20:19.278
Oh my God!

1:20:19.311 --> 1:20:20.546
Oh my God, what the fuck!

1:20:20.579 --> 1:20:21.748
Oh my God, oh my God!

1:20:21.781 --> 1:20:23.148
I wish you hadn't seen that.

1:20:23.181 --> 1:20:24.249
Oh my God, what the fuck!

1:20:30.289 --> 1:20:31.623
Excuse me,
do you need some help?

1:20:34.326 --> 1:20:35.828
Welcome back, sleepyhead.

1:20:39.231 --> 1:20:41.700
Let's see.

1:20:41.734 --> 1:20:42.701
Alright.

1:20:42.735 --> 1:20:45.203
Lavaliers, two wireless mics.

1:20:45.237 --> 1:20:47.807
One's checked out
by documentary team,

1:20:47.840 --> 1:20:49.641
the other by... oh.

1:20:51.410 --> 1:20:52.444
Who?

1:20:52.477 --> 1:20:55.514
Oh, it's uh, Marie Sotker,
she runs the workshop.

1:20:55.547 --> 1:20:56.749
Uh, she checked out the mic

1:20:56.783 --> 1:20:59.618
as well as some
recording equipment.

1:21:00.452 --> 1:21:03.488
Excuse me.

1:21:03.522 --> 1:21:05.724
Fuentes.

1:21:05.758 --> 1:21:06.692
Okay, I'm on my way.

1:21:07.894 --> 1:21:10.295
Why did you kill Duke?

1:21:10.329 --> 1:21:11.530
Duke isn't dead.

1:21:12.431 --> 1:21:14.433
What?

1:21:14.466 --> 1:21:17.135
He's part of my music.

1:21:17.169 --> 1:21:18.470
Your fuckin' music?

1:21:18.503 --> 1:21:19.872
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1:21:19.906 --> 1:21:21.506
Untie me!

1:21:21.540 --> 1:21:23.609
Untie me!

1:21:23.642 --> 1:21:26.578
I wish you could hear
what I hear.

1:21:26.612 --> 1:21:27.245
Help, please!

1:21:28.948 --> 1:21:31.650
No one can hear you, okay?

1:21:33.518 --> 1:21:34.252
Please.

1:21:34.286 --> 1:21:35.922
I have to get back to work now.

1:21:35.955 --> 1:21:37.389
Please.

1:21:37.422 --> 1:21:38.323
Please, please, please,
let me go.

1:21:38.357 --> 1:21:39.257
What are you doing?

1:21:39.291 --> 1:21:40.459
It's okay.

1:21:40.492 --> 1:21:42.594
It's okay.

1:21:42.628 --> 1:21:44.696
Please, please, Alexis,
what are you trying to do?

1:21:44.731 --> 1:21:46.565
What are you doing?

1:21:48.467 --> 1:21:49.468
Please.

1:21:49.501 --> 1:21:51.169
It's okay.

1:21:52.270 --> 1:21:52.671
Please.

1:21:54.439 --> 1:21:55.540
It's okay.

1:22:10.422 --> 1:22:11.891
Love you.

1:22:11.924 --> 1:22:13.291
We don't have much time.

1:22:13.325 --> 1:22:16.896
Has anyone had access
to your harp?

1:22:16.929 --> 1:22:19.197
I mean I just had it serviced.

1:22:19.231 --> 1:22:20.532
By who?

1:22:20.565 --> 1:22:22.401
Alexis.

1:22:22.434 --> 1:22:24.202
Alexis Reeves.

1:22:24.236 --> 1:22:26.304
She teaches
at the university I go to.

1:22:26.338 --> 1:22:28.240
Did you leave your harp
with her?

1:22:28.273 --> 1:22:29.241
Yes.

1:23:28.467 --> 1:23:29.334
Clear!

1:23:44.616 --> 1:23:45.985
Lin,
send forensics to the garage,

1:23:46.018 --> 1:23:47.686
we have a body.

1:23:47.719 --> 1:23:48.320
No, it's a man.

1:23:48.353 --> 1:23:49.621
He was at the art gallery.

1:23:49.654 --> 1:23:52.792
Otherwise, the garage is empty.

1:23:52.825 --> 1:23:53.860
No RV here.

1:23:53.893 --> 1:23:54.761
She might be on the run.

1:23:54.794 --> 1:23:55.660
Put a BOLO out.

1:24:13.246 --> 1:24:15.782
<i>Suspect RV located
at Dockweiler Beach.</i>

1:24:15.815 --> 1:24:17.716
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>

1:24:17.750 --> 1:24:18.450
Copy.

1:24:18.483 --> 1:24:19.718
Unit 88 en route.

1:26:08.828 --> 1:26:09.962
Fuck.

1:26:09.996 --> 1:26:11.663
Fuck!

1:26:11.696 --> 1:26:12.732
Fuck.

1:26:24.944 --> 1:26:25.745
Fuck.

1:26:51.203 --> 1:26:52.637
Marie.

1:27:00.246 --> 1:27:01.881
Marie.

1:27:07.652 --> 1:27:09.721
Hey, are you okay?

1:27:12.724 --> 1:27:14.226
Hey.

1:27:14.260 --> 1:27:16.494
What the...
I'm gonna call 911.

1:28:37.675 --> 1:28:38.676
Police!

1:28:38.710 --> 1:28:39.879
Out of the way!

1:28:39.912 --> 1:28:43.015
Get the fuck away!

1:28:43.049 --> 1:28:46.252
Marie, it's Detective Fuentes.

1:28:46.285 --> 1:28:48.354
Please, stop moving.

1:28:48.387 --> 1:28:50.956
Stay where you are,
I'm here to help you.

1:28:52.358 --> 1:28:53.558
Where's Alexis?

1:29:03.736 --> 1:29:07.006
Stop, let me take a look
at what she's done to you.

1:29:28.828 --> 1:29:30.396
Stay with me.

1:29:34.033 --> 1:29:34.666
No.

1:29:34.699 --> 1:29:35.700
Wake up.

1:29:35.734 --> 1:29:36.701
Marie!

1:29:36.735 --> 1:29:37.803
Marie!
