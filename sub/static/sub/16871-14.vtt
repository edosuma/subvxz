00:01.195 --> 00:02.898
Previously, on "The Mindy Project"...

00:02.968 --> 00:05.337
This year, I finally met the best guy.

00:05.338 --> 00:07.072
He has a steady job, cool daughter,

00:07.073 --> 00:09.040
and he says straight-up cute
stuff like...

00:09.041 --> 00:10.275
I think I kinda love you.

00:10.276 --> 00:12.277
The more I get to know you,
the more I love you.

00:12.278 --> 00:15.947
The only place
I really wanna be is right here.

00:15.948 --> 00:17.215
Things are going great with Ben.

00:17.216 --> 00:18.517
You guys will probably get married.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.818
I'm not getting married to Ben.

00:19.819 --> 00:21.353
Besides, who says
I even need to get married?

00:21.354 --> 00:22.487
You don't.

00:22.488 --> 00:24.389
Honestly, you're too cool
to get married.

00:24.390 --> 00:25.390
I guess I should talk to him about it.

00:25.391 --> 00:26.458
Yeah.

00:26.459 --> 00:29.427
Dad, that's it. That's the ring.

00:29.428 --> 00:30.662
We'll take it.

00:30.663 --> 00:33.298
- You don't wanna get married.
- I don't.

00:33.299 --> 00:35.059
I love you and I don't want
things to change.

00:44.343 --> 00:46.211
Okay, everyone,
we've gotten some complaints

00:46.212 --> 00:47.913
about our phone etiquette.

00:47.914 --> 00:48.980
Now, I'm not naming any names,

00:48.981 --> 00:50.949
but I would prefer it if from now on,

00:50.950 --> 00:54.286
no one answered calls with,
"You have 30 seconds. Wow me."

00:54.287 --> 00:55.520
Well, it must be nice to have all day

00:55.521 --> 00:57.122
to just chitchat on the phone.

00:57.123 --> 00:58.657

01:11.137 --> 01:13.672
in the five months
we've known each other,

01:13.673 --> 01:15.073
I've grown to love you more than

01:15.074 --> 01:17.609
Dominique Wilkins loves slam dunks.

01:17.610 --> 01:20.145
This isn't happening.

01:20.146 --> 01:21.880
I know this is sudden,

01:21.881 --> 01:25.450
but it would seriously rule
if you would be my wife.

01:25.451 --> 01:27.385
- Ohh!
- Yes! Yes!

01:27.386 --> 01:31.856
Two times, yes!

01:33.526 --> 01:35.026
Now, in Kimball-Kinney tradition,

01:35.027 --> 01:37.028
I'm supposed to carry you away
on a horse,

01:37.029 --> 01:39.664
but the horse got spooked
and ran into the Lincoln Tunnel.

01:39.665 --> 01:41.933
Oh, well, that's okay, Colette.

01:41.934 --> 01:43.935
You're the only ride I'll ever need.

01:43.936 --> 01:45.770

02:17.495 --> 02:20.205
They sounded like a chorus of gay angels

02:20.206 --> 02:23.008
and then Colette, she picks her up
and carries her out on her back.

02:23.009 --> 02:24.476
- Yeah.
- So romantic.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.011
But then Colette's knee gave out

02:26.012 --> 02:28.346
and she flattened Farzad's newsstand.

02:28.347 --> 02:30.682
Yeah, that's... that's cool, man.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.083
- I'm sorry, hey, hello.
- Huh? What?

02:32.084 --> 02:33.151
I'm telling you this crazy story.

02:33.152 --> 02:34.953
What's wrong, dude? Is it my cologne?

02:34.954 --> 02:36.054
It... it's propane.

02:36.055 --> 02:38.256
No, it's...

02:38.257 --> 02:39.257
Can you keep a secret?

02:40.593 --> 02:44.829
I don't know, man. I'm like 0 for 500.

02:44.830 --> 02:47.365
I was about to propose to Mindy.

02:47.366 --> 02:49.000
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

02:49.001 --> 02:50.902
- Bought a ring and everything.
- Ahh!

02:50.903 --> 02:52.337
Princess cut blood diamond.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.772
- Her favorite kind.
- That's what she wants.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.040
But out of nowhere, she announces

02:55.041 --> 02:56.941
that she doesn't ever wanna get married.

02:56.942 --> 02:59.010
- Sh... she said that?
- Yeah.

02:59.011 --> 03:00.845
When did she say that, exactly?

03:00.846 --> 03:02.247
Was it, like, a long time ago?

03:02.248 --> 03:06.317
Or was it, like, last Saturday
after she and I spoke?

03:06.318 --> 03:08.253
Yeah, it was last Saturday, yeah.

03:08.254 --> 03:11.022
That is...

03:11.023 --> 03:12.757
She said she doesn't want to
get married because I can't

03:12.758 --> 03:14.592
give her anything
that she doesn't already have.

03:14.593 --> 03:17.062
- Mm-mm, mm-mm. Mm.
- I know.

03:17.063 --> 03:19.197
She's clearly going crazy
and she has some kind of

03:19.198 --> 03:20.532
brain parasite, 'cause she's always

03:20.533 --> 03:21.900
eating that expired peanut butter.

03:21.901 --> 03:24.202
I gotta go to her house and get
rid of that peanut butter.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.671
Otherwise, s-she's gonna die.

03:26.672 --> 03:28.406
All right. Watch...

03:28.407 --> 03:29.441
- You all right?
- Yep.

03:29.442 --> 03:30.442
I got it.

03:33.179 --> 03:36.247
The Squares Exhibit
at the Museum of Geometry.

03:36.248 --> 03:38.283
It's only the greatest
collection of square art

03:38.284 --> 03:40.752
ever assembled
in the Northern Hemisphere.

03:40.753 --> 03:43.354
And I've got two tickets
to the opening night.

03:43.355 --> 03:45.090
Oh, thank you.

03:45.091 --> 03:47.559
This is very thoughtful.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.729
Of course. Obviously,
we'll be going as... as friends.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.031
I wanna be square with you.

03:53.032 --> 03:54.899
Oh. The Square Exhibit.

03:54.900 --> 03:56.267
Knock, knock.

03:56.268 --> 03:58.403
Just wanted to invite you all
to a little engagement party

03:58.404 --> 04:00.338
I'm throwing tomorrow
in honor of the future

04:00.339 --> 04:02.273
Mrs. and Mrs. Kimball-Kinney.

04:02.274 --> 04:04.075
The theme is "Fried Green Tomatoes."

04:04.076 --> 04:05.610
Oh, how wonderful.

04:05.611 --> 04:08.680
You know, I have a broach with
Jessica Tandy's profile on it.

04:08.681 --> 04:10.949
Wonderful. 7:00 p. m. sharp.

04:10.950 --> 04:14.753
No gifts under $100.
They'll just be thrown out.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.154
Right.

04:17.156 --> 04:20.091
I'm so happy for Colette.

04:20.091 --> 04:21.826
You know, I was her first kiss.

04:21.827 --> 04:24.796
She said, "Well, that settles that."

04:24.797 --> 04:27.198
Hm? Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

04:27.199 --> 04:29.701
It's Tim. He won't sign
the divorce papers,

04:29.702 --> 04:31.803
and he keeps texting
for a second chance.

04:31.804 --> 04:35.039
Well, as your friend,
my advice would be:

04:35.040 --> 04:36.641
go with your gut.

04:36.642 --> 04:39.010
It's usually right. Except for that year

04:39.011 --> 04:41.312
I thought I could pull off
one dangly earring.

04:41.313 --> 04:43.681
Well, yes, of course. You're right.

04:43.682 --> 04:46.752
I moved out for a reason and not
just because my maid hates me.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.188
I'm not going to text him back.

04:50.189 --> 04:52.657
Well done.

04:52.658 --> 04:54.726
Hey, what's going on in here?

04:54.727 --> 04:57.629
I'm eating my lunch.
Are those bridal magazines?

04:57.630 --> 05:01.666
I thought maybe we could chill
and plan your future wedding.

05:01.667 --> 05:04.536
I already planned mine.
It's BYOB, BYO food,

05:04.537 --> 05:07.005
BYO silverware, BYO chair.

05:07.006 --> 05:08.306
Plan my wedding?

05:08.307 --> 05:09.340
You're the one that convinced me

05:09.341 --> 05:10.842
that I don't need to get married.

05:10.843 --> 05:13.411
And honestly, it's been so freeing.

05:13.412 --> 05:14.746
I have so much extra brain space.

05:14.747 --> 05:17.015
I can finally understand my TV shows.

05:17.016 --> 05:18.716
Transparent's a guy!

05:18.717 --> 05:20.552
But what about Ben?

05:20.553 --> 05:22.220
Do you not want to get married
because you're afraid

05:22.221 --> 05:24.322
you're not gonna bond
with his Jewish relatives?

05:24.323 --> 05:26.457
Just don't tell them
your theories on Israel.

05:26.458 --> 05:27.759
I don't know what it is.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.727
Is it a place? Is it an idea?

05:29.728 --> 05:32.197
I-I would just leave
the whole area alone.

05:32.198 --> 05:33.865
Please, please. I talked to Ben.

05:33.866 --> 05:35.099
He doesn't want to get married either.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.534
It's good to keep talking about this

05:36.535 --> 05:38.469
because things change
and evolve and stuff.

05:38.470 --> 05:39.737
So maybe you should talk to him again.

05:39.738 --> 05:44.209
I'm enjoying my lunch.
I think you should go.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.243
Hey!

05:45.244 --> 05:46.578
What's up, you guys?

05:46.579 --> 05:49.013
Colette, you are absolutely glowing.

05:49.014 --> 05:50.415
You must really love this woman.

05:50.416 --> 05:52.417
I think it's so romantic
that you're just

05:52.418 --> 05:54.452
letting someone come into your
life and change it forever.

05:54.453 --> 05:56.087
When you stay single long enough,

05:56.088 --> 05:57.856
marriage starts to become
less like a bond

05:57.857 --> 06:00.558
and looks more like one of those
little plastic cubes

06:00.559 --> 06:02.527
where they imprison super heroes
to deprive them

06:02.528 --> 06:03.728
of their super powers.

06:03.729 --> 06:04.996
Oh, yeah? Huh.

06:04.997 --> 06:07.332
My life is so fulfilling by myself

06:07.333 --> 06:09.434
that the idea of having to share it

06:09.435 --> 06:11.803
with someone 50/50 forever...

06:11.804 --> 06:13.171
I mean, can you imagine? Barf.

06:13.172 --> 06:15.373
- I would kill myself.
- Yeah.

06:15.374 --> 06:17.041
But Colette, you are young.

06:17.042 --> 06:19.244
And it warms my heart to see you

06:19.245 --> 06:23.214
completely lose yourself
in another person.

06:23.215 --> 06:24.650
Cool.

06:25.820 --> 06:28.821
_

06:28.845 --> 06:30.523
_

06:30.625 --> 06:33.312
_

06:33.406 --> 06:38.062
Hi, your estranged husband
is standing right behind me.

06:38.063 --> 06:40.932
Tim. Why are you here? Oh, no.

06:40.933 --> 06:42.634
Are you cheating on me
with someone who works here?

06:42.635 --> 06:44.969
It ain't cheating if you're broken up.

06:44.970 --> 06:47.405
Hi, I'm Beverly.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.040
No. Stop.

06:49.041 --> 06:52.944
Anna, I'm here because I think
it's time for you to come home.

06:52.945 --> 06:54.979
I mean, your Japanese toilet misses you,

06:54.980 --> 06:57.048
your panic room misses you

06:57.049 --> 06:58.583
and I miss you.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.152
You cheated on me
with my own closet organizer.

07:01.153 --> 07:02.587
She knows me better than anyone.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.723
And I'm sorry.
I know what I did was wrong

07:05.724 --> 07:08.927
but I also know that you don't
sleep well when you're not home.

07:08.928 --> 07:12.864
And you're a mess without
your solid three hours a night.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.532
It's true.

07:14.533 --> 07:16.734
I haven't been sleeping well
in my Airbnb.

07:16.735 --> 07:19.437
It has a poorly executed nautical theme.

07:19.438 --> 07:20.972
I'm so sorry.

07:20.973 --> 07:22.473
Listen, just come over for a drink.

07:22.474 --> 07:23.641
We'll see how it feels.

07:23.642 --> 07:26.644
What do you say?

07:26.645 --> 07:28.947
- I'll think about it.
- I'll show you out.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.115
- Okay. Ow.
- Right this way.

07:31.116 --> 07:32.217
You're hurting my arm.

07:38.824 --> 07:40.792
Thanks for inviting me over
for a girls' night, Mindy.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.061
Leo and I love spending time with you.

07:43.062 --> 07:44.262
And he doesn't like anybody.

07:44.263 --> 07:45.997
Seriously, he bit a mall Santa.

07:45.998 --> 07:48.299
The Santa swore, he got fired.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.434
Leo's the best.

07:49.435 --> 07:51.069
I always wanted a younger brother.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.237
We could go to the park, read together.

07:53.238 --> 07:55.606
Oh, hey, do you wanna make
a little extra money?

07:55.607 --> 07:57.308
I need a babysitter tomorrow night.

07:57.309 --> 07:59.010
Leo's old babysitter quit.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.912
He was getting handsy with her.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.380
I guess he takes after his mom.

08:02.381 --> 08:03.881
That sounds great. Where are you going?

08:03.882 --> 08:05.883
I am going to an engagement party.

08:05.884 --> 08:07.218
And actually, there'll be an open bar

08:07.219 --> 08:08.519
so it would be great
if you could just lay out

08:08.520 --> 08:10.521
some, like, trash bags around the bed.

08:10.522 --> 08:13.691
Wait, my dad proposed to you
without telling me?

08:13.692 --> 08:17.028
I helped him pick the ring.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.797
Your dad bought a ring
and was gonna propose to me?

08:19.798 --> 08:21.319
Uh...

08:21.344 --> 08:22.679
No?

08:23.968 --> 08:25.085
Oh, my God.

08:28.805 --> 08:30.274
Your dad bought me a ring?

08:30.275 --> 08:31.709
Did he get it from
a Jewish man in the city

08:31.710 --> 08:33.611
- or a Latino man in the mall?
- I don't know.

08:33.611 --> 08:35.113
Maybe he didn't buy you a ring.

08:35.114 --> 08:36.748
My memory's bad...

08:36.749 --> 08:38.883
because I just started doing drugs.

08:38.884 --> 08:41.284
Please. You're too good
of a kid for all that.

08:41.285 --> 08:43.721
You tattled on me when you
caught me sniffing your markers.

08:43.722 --> 08:46.758
Fine, yes. My dad did buy you
an engagement ring.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.026
Really nice one.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.328
He sold his "All-American Comics" #16.

08:50.329 --> 08:52.697
- It's the first appearance of...
- Golden Age Green Lantern.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.332
Oh, my God!

08:54.333 --> 08:55.767
I know that because he yelled at me

08:55.768 --> 08:58.002
when I was reading that comic
with chocolaty fingers.

08:58.003 --> 08:59.404
Well, what is he waiting for?

08:59.405 --> 09:01.439
- Why hasn't he proposed?
- I don't know.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.541
Oh, wait. Maybe it's because I told him

09:03.542 --> 09:05.543
that I never want to get married.

09:05.544 --> 09:07.512
And I don't. I don't think.

09:07.513 --> 09:09.680
I don't know. Ugh.

09:09.681 --> 09:12.650
Lindsay, why is he listening to me now?

09:12.651 --> 09:15.086
I mean, I don't even listen to
half the crap I say.

09:15.087 --> 09:16.954
Just don't tell Dad I told you, okay?

09:16.955 --> 09:18.256
He might get mad.

09:18.257 --> 09:20.725
Lindsay, I have to talk to
your father about this, okay?

09:20.726 --> 09:23.761
If it helps, I could tell him
I heard it from a transient.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.200
Morgan, Karen and I wanted to
talk to you about...

09:29.201 --> 09:32.470
Ah, you want me to plan
your bachelorette party for you.

09:32.471 --> 09:33.938
Too late! Already did it.

09:33.939 --> 09:35.673
It's at the Ukrainian Community Center.

09:35.674 --> 09:37.475
There has to be an orthodox
priest present,

09:37.476 --> 09:39.110
but you can smoke inside.

09:39.111 --> 09:42.080
No, uh, we want you
to move out of the apartment.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.347
We're getting a new place together?

09:43.348 --> 09:45.349
I promise, I will not stink this one up.

09:45.350 --> 09:46.851
- I will wash...
- It's just that

09:46.852 --> 09:49.087
Karen thinks it would be weird

09:49.088 --> 09:52.857
if we still live together
after we wife each other.

09:53.859 --> 09:57.528
- Oh, and I agree.
- Mm-hmm.

09:57.529 --> 09:59.030
- Sorry.
- You know I can't

09:59.031 --> 10:00.098
go back to my grandmother.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.867
She put a Roma curse on me
last time I left.

10:02.868 --> 10:05.470
This is what happens
when people get married.

10:05.471 --> 10:08.005
They stop spending so much time
with their friends.

10:08.006 --> 10:10.174
Really? I like my friends.

10:10.175 --> 10:13.244
Not as much as you're gonna
like sitting in our apartment,

10:13.245 --> 10:15.613
talking about our relationship.

10:15.614 --> 10:17.715
Oh, God. You know what?

10:17.716 --> 10:20.418
No offense. Screw you both. Okay?

10:20.419 --> 10:22.354
- Morgan.
- I've never been so betrayed.

10:25.390 --> 10:26.691
Oh, hey, Ben.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.860
Hey, a transient told me
you bought an engagement ring.

10:28.861 --> 10:32.663
Damn it, Lindsay. She told you?

10:32.664 --> 10:34.398
Yes. But it's not Lindsay's fault.

10:34.399 --> 10:37.168
It's your fault, for teaching
her the importance of honesty.

10:37.169 --> 10:39.303
Okay, fine, yes.

10:39.304 --> 10:41.606
I was going to propose.

10:41.607 --> 10:43.641
Until you told me, in very clear terms,

10:43.642 --> 10:45.576
that you had no interest in marrying me.

10:45.577 --> 10:48.146
How does someone who's wanted
to get married her whole life

10:48.147 --> 10:50.982
tell her boyfriend
she doesn't want to marry him?

10:50.983 --> 10:52.316
This is is one of those cases

10:52.317 --> 10:54.218
where you have to tell
a little white lie.

10:54.219 --> 10:56.921
Like when I tell my brother
Rishi he has potential.

10:56.922 --> 11:00.758
Hey, it's not you. Okay?

11:00.759 --> 11:02.593
I don't believe in marriage.
I never have.

11:02.594 --> 11:03.995
It's just one of those institutions

11:03.996 --> 11:07.331
that I don't support,
like the FDA or libraries.

11:07.332 --> 11:08.900
It doesn't mean that I love you any less

11:08.901 --> 11:12.236
or don't want to be with you.

11:12.237 --> 11:15.206
Yeah.

11:15.207 --> 11:17.842
Okay, I guess that makes me
feel a little better.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.443
You could have told me a little earlier.

11:19.444 --> 11:21.612
Might not have let Kevin Smith
lowball me on my

11:21.613 --> 11:23.981
super-rare "Green Lantern."

11:23.982 --> 11:27.618
But, hey, I'm glad I know.

11:27.619 --> 11:29.288
Yes! He bought it.

11:33.091 --> 11:34.458
People come down hard on lying,

11:34.459 --> 11:36.694
but man, does it get the job done.

11:43.001 --> 11:46.804
Ah, here come the blushing brides.

11:46.805 --> 11:48.639
If we weren't related
and you two were into guys,

11:48.640 --> 11:50.308
I don't know if I could control myself.

11:50.309 --> 11:52.543
Aw, thanks, Bro.

11:52.544 --> 11:54.278
- You are so sweet.
- Karen, you're gonna

11:54.279 --> 11:55.713
like being a Kimball-Kinney.

11:55.714 --> 11:58.416
With this whole spooky,
ethereal vibe you got going on,

11:58.417 --> 12:00.117
you'll fit right in
with the New Orleans vampire

12:00.118 --> 12:02.119
- side of the family.
- I'm so excited.

12:02.120 --> 12:05.556
We're gonna spend the rest of
our lives together,

12:05.557 --> 12:07.491
future brother!

12:07.492 --> 12:09.460
- Oh!
- Oh, get over here.

12:09.461 --> 12:10.595
I'm gonna grab us some drinks.

12:10.596 --> 12:12.230
- Okay.
- Right over there. Right there.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.498
Oh, Colette, you must be so happy.

12:14.499 --> 12:17.735
Knowing who you're gonna be
lying next to for eternity?

12:17.736 --> 12:21.239
Your bodies entombed together
in the Kimball mausoleum.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.040
Your skulls entombed in the
Kinney mausoleum,

12:23.041 --> 12:25.776
as per the treaty of 1893.

12:25.777 --> 12:27.478
Yeah, ha!

12:27.479 --> 12:30.314
I am super excited.

12:30.315 --> 12:33.017
But what if the family disapproves?

12:33.018 --> 12:34.185
I wouldn't worry about that.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.686
I've already spoken to them.

12:35.687 --> 12:37.188
In fact, your cousin came up
from Georgia

12:37.189 --> 12:38.589
with a bushel of wedding peaches.

12:38.590 --> 12:40.958
So everyone's on board?

12:40.959 --> 12:42.693
Even you.

12:42.694 --> 12:44.829
'Cause it's cool if you're not.

12:44.830 --> 12:48.165
I can just stay
a wild and free poon magnet

12:48.166 --> 12:49.200
for the rest of my life.

12:49.201 --> 12:51.502
On the contrary, I am thrilled.

12:51.503 --> 12:52.703
In fact, I've already bought the tent

12:52.704 --> 12:54.739
on your registry
at Dick's Sporting Goods.

12:54.740 --> 12:58.809
- Mm, okay. Whoo! Yes.
- Here we go. Ding!

12:58.810 --> 13:02.113
- Eternity!
- Yeah! Ohh!

13:02.114 --> 13:04.582
So, Ben, any chance of us attending

13:04.583 --> 13:06.851
another engagement party anytime soon?

13:06.852 --> 13:08.953
Uh, no. Not at the moment.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.821
'Cause I wouldn't be upset
if I had to paint

13:10.822 --> 13:12.923
- another Japanese engagement fan.
- Oh.

13:12.924 --> 13:15.192
Or you could propose at this party.

13:15.193 --> 13:17.128
That'd create a commotion
and I could grab

13:17.129 --> 13:19.330
- a couple of things.
- Well, if it were up to me,

13:19.331 --> 13:20.998
we'd be engaged already. but, uh...

13:20.999 --> 13:22.433
She thinks your kids will look weird?

13:22.434 --> 13:25.469
No, actually, I think
our kids would look pretty cute.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.171
- Oh, definitely, sure.
- Mm, maybe to some people.

13:27.172 --> 13:28.506
- Ehh.
- The truth is,

13:28.507 --> 13:31.309
Mindy's just not
the marriage type, you know?

13:31.310 --> 13:33.444
- Huh?
- Why are you guys

13:33.445 --> 13:34.679
looking at each other like that?

13:34.680 --> 13:36.614
Because we think you're nuts.

13:36.615 --> 13:39.250
Ben, Mindy's obsessed with marriage.

13:39.251 --> 13:41.986
She's thanked in the credits
to "27 Dresses."

13:41.987 --> 13:45.089
He wedding Pinterest shut down
an entire server farm.

13:45.090 --> 13:48.759
Vera Wang has a restraining
order out on her.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.361
- Do I need to continue?
- No, no, I think I get it.

13:50.362 --> 13:52.396
But why would she say
she doesn't care about weddings?

13:52.397 --> 13:54.999
Because she lies like a kid
raised in foster care.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.667
And she hoards food like one too.

13:56.668 --> 13:58.269
Did you not know this?

13:58.270 --> 13:59.270
About the food, yes.

13:59.271 --> 14:03.341
But the... this, no.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.811
Excuse me.

14:06.812 --> 14:10.548
My, my. There's some
juicy gossip afoot, my hens.

14:10.549 --> 14:12.149
- Cluck, cluck.
- Eww.

14:12.150 --> 14:14.118
- No? Okay.
- Ooh, now that's some gossip.

14:14.119 --> 14:16.620
Dr. Z just walked in with Mr. Z.

14:16.621 --> 14:18.022
Looks like she's changing her tune from

14:18.023 --> 14:19.323
"To the left, to the left"

14:19.324 --> 14:21.392
to "To the right, to the right."

14:21.393 --> 14:24.762
Yeah, wow. Just keep looking over there,

14:24.763 --> 14:27.998
to the left, to the left.

14:27.999 --> 14:30.868
To the right, to the right.

14:30.869 --> 14:32.236
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen,

14:32.237 --> 14:33.971
if I could have your attention, please.

14:33.972 --> 14:37.975
My future sister-in-law has
a few words she'd like to say.

14:37.976 --> 14:39.810
- Thank you.
- Take it away.

14:39.811 --> 14:43.381
Little did I know,
growing up, one of seven girls

14:43.382 --> 14:45.983
in a two-room cabin in No Name, Alaska,

14:45.984 --> 14:48.552
where it's daytime
once a year and alcohol

14:48.553 --> 14:50.154
is the only cure for insanity,

14:50.155 --> 14:54.191
that I would find my love
in the big city.

14:54.192 --> 14:56.560
When I saw that corn-silk goddess,

14:56.561 --> 14:59.930
waving like mad at me
from across the lacrosse pitch.

14:59.931 --> 15:03.434
And then she yelled...
well, Colette tells it better.

15:03.435 --> 15:06.504
No, I... I don't. I don't remember.

15:06.505 --> 15:09.373
She yelled, "Get off the dang field.

15:09.374 --> 15:11.876
You can't do your Hula-Hooping here."

15:13.678 --> 15:17.181
And while words can't express
how I feel,

15:17.182 --> 15:19.150
maybe music can.

15:19.151 --> 15:20.618
Oh, oh, no, no, no.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.086
I'm good. You don't need to...

Ow! Ow!

16:41.574 --> 16:42.876
What's up?

16:52.698 --> 16:54.564
Has anyone seen Colette?

16:54.666 --> 16:56.714
She's not answering her walkie-talkie.

16:56.715 --> 16:58.182
- I haven't seen her.
- No.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.583
Popeye, this is Olive Oyl. Over and out.

16:59.584 --> 17:01.652
- Not good.
- Um, you know what?

17:01.653 --> 17:03.454
I'm sorry. I see someone I fired once.

17:03.455 --> 17:04.688
I'm gonna go make them uncomfortable.

17:04.689 --> 17:06.156
Okay.

17:08.926 --> 17:11.060
No, Jeremy, I don't want to
join your book club.

17:11.061 --> 17:12.730
Miss Marple mysteries are too easy.

17:12.731 --> 17:15.699
Okay, very good. How could you
bring Tim to this party

17:15.700 --> 17:17.067
after everything he's put you through?

17:17.068 --> 17:19.270
I didn't plan on it.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.405
I only went over there
to get my food dehydrator,

17:21.406 --> 17:25.041
and then we stumbled into
a classic Tim-Anna fun day.

17:25.042 --> 17:26.477
He screamed on a conference call

17:26.478 --> 17:28.579
and I checked our tap water's PH.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.915
- Felt so nice.
- He cheated on you.

17:30.916 --> 17:34.785
I know. But he promises he's changed.

17:34.786 --> 17:35.786
Oh.

17:35.787 --> 17:36.820
He just listed the sex apartment

17:36.821 --> 17:38.322
he shared with Eliot Spitzer.

17:38.323 --> 17:40.190
Listen to yourself.

17:40.191 --> 17:43.260
I don't know how to be alone.

17:43.261 --> 17:46.130
Without my regular routine,
I'm going a little bit crazy.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.831
I'm beginning to worry
I might not turn back

17:47.832 --> 17:49.066
during one of my ocean swims.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.268
Anna, calm down. Take a deep breath.

17:51.269 --> 17:53.637
Okay, but I can hold my breath
for seven minutes.

17:53.638 --> 17:55.806
See? This is my point.

17:55.807 --> 17:58.242
You are remarkable in every way.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.310
And you shouldn't be with somebody

17:59.311 --> 18:00.911
who doesn't appreciate that.

18:00.912 --> 18:02.446
And by the way, you're not alone, okay?

18:02.447 --> 18:04.148
You've got me as a friend.

18:04.149 --> 18:05.816
And in future, if I don't
see you in the morning,

18:05.817 --> 18:10.020
I'll know to call the Coast Guard.

18:10.021 --> 18:11.790
Thank you, Jeremy.

18:18.296 --> 18:20.064
- Wow.
- Hey, there you are.

18:20.065 --> 18:23.367
Hey, you have to check out
Jody's hunting trophies.

18:23.368 --> 18:26.770
There's a deer, a lion.
Golden Retriever, ehh.

18:26.771 --> 18:28.706
- Yeah, he loves his taxidermy.
- Yeah.

18:28.707 --> 18:31.308
So you don't care about weddings, huh?

18:31.309 --> 18:32.910
Yep. That's me.

18:32.911 --> 18:36.780
Yeah, that's interesting because I found

18:36.781 --> 18:39.383
this blog that you kept,
called "Bridal Wave."

18:39.384 --> 18:44.288
Oh, and this wedding cake review
podcast, "Oh No You Fondant!"

18:44.289 --> 18:45.756
I gained ten pounds after two episodes

18:45.757 --> 18:47.658
- and my doctor made me stop.
- So I guess you don't have

18:47.659 --> 18:49.994
a problem with getting married,
you just have a problem

18:49.995 --> 18:51.895
- with getting married to me.
- No, Ben, look.

18:51.896 --> 18:53.030
I have an explanation.

18:53.031 --> 18:54.565
I don't need you to explain, Mindy.

18:54.566 --> 18:58.936
I just need you to be honest with me.

18:58.937 --> 19:01.106
I don't want to fight.
I'm gonna go, though.

19:04.909 --> 19:06.644
Anybody seen Colette?

19:06.645 --> 19:08.879
Colette!

19:08.880 --> 19:11.515
Are you kidding me?

19:11.516 --> 19:13.484
Hey, man. What gives?

19:13.485 --> 19:15.719
Anna just said that
she doesn't wanna reconcile.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.155
Did she? Gosh, I'm so sorry.
That's awful.

19:18.156 --> 19:20.924
She was all cool until
she started talking to you.

19:20.925 --> 19:23.027
I don't know what you said,
but do you even have

19:23.028 --> 19:24.228
the Bro Code in England?

19:24.229 --> 19:26.196
Yeah, we have the original Bro Code.

19:26.197 --> 19:28.165
The Magna Carta.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.800
And also, all I told her

19:29.801 --> 19:31.368
was that she's strong enough
to be alone.

19:31.369 --> 19:32.670
Well, are you strong enough

19:32.671 --> 19:34.538
not to have your ass handed to you?

19:34.539 --> 19:37.374
I think Joseph
Pilates would agree that I was.

19:37.375 --> 19:40.010
Ahh!

19:41.279 --> 19:42.780
Hey, you're back early.

19:42.781 --> 19:43.947
How was the party?

19:43.948 --> 19:45.883
Did you and Jeremy wear
the same outfit again?

19:45.884 --> 19:48.419
No. Thank God.

19:48.420 --> 19:51.155
Hey, can I ask you a serious question?

19:51.156 --> 19:53.223
Sure, but if it gets too awkward,

19:53.224 --> 19:54.491
I'll have to look at my phone.

19:54.492 --> 19:56.527
Absolutely, I completely understand.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.362
Would it be a big difference for you

19:58.363 --> 20:01.432
if I was your step-mom, versus
just your dad's girlfriend?

20:01.433 --> 20:02.700
Are you kidding? Of course it would.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.401
But why? It wouldn't make us

20:04.402 --> 20:06.236
care about each other any more.

20:06.237 --> 20:07.638
And if anything, if I was your step-mom,

20:07.639 --> 20:10.441
I'd be way more inclined
to do, like, I don't know,

20:10.442 --> 20:12.876
make you do chores while Leo
attends the Prince's Ball.

20:12.877 --> 20:14.511
But Leo would be my step-brother

20:14.512 --> 20:18.248
and we could talk about
how crazy our parents are.

20:18.249 --> 20:21.118
Um, I...

20:21.119 --> 20:23.287
and more than anything,
if you were my step-mom,

20:23.288 --> 20:28.125
it would be proof that
you weren't going anywhere.

20:28.126 --> 20:31.195
Okay. Come here.

20:31.196 --> 20:33.864
Also, it's so weird
that you're a girlfriend

20:33.865 --> 20:36.500
- when you're so old.
- Okay.

20:36.501 --> 20:38.569
No tip, now. I'm extremely young.

20:38.570 --> 20:41.405
- Go make us ice cream sundaes.
- I'm on it.

20:50.515 --> 20:52.750
Morgan, thank God. There you are.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.018
- The first place I looked.
- What's up, Colette?

20:55.019 --> 20:56.453
You gonna kick me out of here too?

20:56.454 --> 20:59.123
Yeah, but just because you
can't sleep in phlebotomy.

20:59.124 --> 21:02.159
It's full of blood,
urine and a skeleton.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.994
So what? So am I.

21:03.995 --> 21:07.898
That's a good point.

21:07.899 --> 21:10.100
I really missed you at that party.

21:10.101 --> 21:12.736
No one wanted to have
a shrimp eating contest with me,

21:12.737 --> 21:15.506
so I had to compete against
my personal best.

21:15.507 --> 21:17.641
Did you bring me home the tails?

21:17.642 --> 21:19.643
I'm sorry, I just...

21:19.644 --> 21:22.646
I got cold feet and snuck out.

21:22.647 --> 21:26.116
I love Karen, but I'm not
ready to get married.

21:26.117 --> 21:27.417
Oh, my God.

21:27.418 --> 21:29.086
It's real easy for me to hook up,

21:29.087 --> 21:32.589
but hard for me to establish
a real emotional connection.

21:32.590 --> 21:33.590
I know, I sleep above you.

21:33.591 --> 21:35.159
But then I had one with Karen,

21:35.160 --> 21:39.062
and I was like, man,
I need to lock her down.

21:39.063 --> 21:40.497
Spring was in the air,

21:40.498 --> 21:43.100
the Gay Men's Chorus owed me a favor,

21:43.101 --> 21:44.735
but then that wore off, and I was like,

21:44.736 --> 21:47.337
is this the last woman

21:47.338 --> 21:50.207
I will ever camp with?

21:50.208 --> 21:52.576
I'm sorry, but if you're not
gonna get married,

21:52.577 --> 21:54.044
can I please move back in?

21:54.045 --> 21:56.313
Okay, I can't go back
to the hostel in Times Square.

21:56.314 --> 21:58.715
These Dutch girls,
they're so mean to me.

21:58.716 --> 22:00.884
You can move back in on one condition.

22:00.885 --> 22:03.387
I will never again warm my
underpants in the microwave.

22:03.388 --> 22:04.621
- Ever.
- No, no, no.

22:04.622 --> 22:07.591
No, I need you to
break up with Karen for me.

22:07.592 --> 22:10.761
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm terrible at giving bad news.

22:10.762 --> 22:13.564
If you wanna move back home,

22:13.565 --> 22:15.465
you gotta help me out here.

22:15.466 --> 22:16.633
All right, fine, I'll do it.

22:16.634 --> 22:18.802
Oh, you're the best! Ahh!

22:18.803 --> 22:20.070
- I love you.
- I love you!

22:20.071 --> 22:21.538
- I love you.
- Ohh.

22:21.539 --> 22:23.073
Oh, I gotta get out of here.

22:23.074 --> 22:25.509
This train is being held in the station

22:25.510 --> 22:28.412
for connection with a downtown express.

22:28.413 --> 22:30.514
Please be patient, ladies and gentlemen.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.015
Excuse me, sir.
Have you heard the good news?

22:32.016 --> 22:34.418
I'm sorry, I'm Jewish, I...

22:34.419 --> 22:36.753
Hey. What are you doing here?

22:36.754 --> 22:38.422
Okay, look, Ben.

22:38.423 --> 22:42.159
Yes, my whole life, I have been
obsessed with marriage.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.394
And it kept not happening so I thought,

22:44.395 --> 22:46.597
wait, is something wrong with me?

22:46.598 --> 22:49.433
And then through work
and having Leo and meeting you,

22:49.434 --> 22:52.703
I realized no,
there's nothing wrong with me.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.771
I'm the most perfect person
in the whole world.

22:54.772 --> 22:56.573
Yeah, that seems like
a really unhealthy way

22:56.574 --> 22:59.076
- to think about yourself.
- And then, recently,

22:59.077 --> 23:01.111
I met someone who reminded me

23:01.112 --> 23:03.614
that marriage isn't just about
making a couple.

23:03.615 --> 23:06.450
It's about making a family.

23:06.451 --> 23:07.851
Hi, Dad.

23:07.852 --> 23:09.987
Hey. What...

23:09.988 --> 23:14.491
Leo, you're dressed up.

23:14.492 --> 23:15.959
Wow.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.562
I don't need to get married anymore.

23:18.563 --> 23:20.497
I want to get married.

23:20.498 --> 23:21.832
To you.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.167
And I know this is really crazy
and impulsive,

23:24.168 --> 23:26.536
but hey dude, that's kinda
what you signed up for.

23:26.537 --> 23:29.473
So...

23:29.474 --> 23:31.141
Ben, with this super-rare,

23:31.142 --> 23:33.944
unbelievably expensive
comic book, I wanted to know,

23:33.945 --> 23:36.680
will you marry me?

23:36.681 --> 23:37.681
Come.

23:41.419 --> 23:44.321
- Mm.
- Ahh.

23:45.323 --> 23:47.069
Oh, I love you.

23:47.102 --> 23:49.507
- Aw, I love you guys.
- I love you guys too.
