01:31.600 --> 01:35.485
I sell mayhem, scandal, murder, and doom.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.525
Oh, Jesus, I do.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.365
I sell the newborn and the dead.

01:41.440 --> 01:46.128
I sell the wretched, magnificent city
of New York back to its people.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.043
I sell newspapers.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.161
Thanks for your time. Yeah?

02:04.240 --> 02:06.322
Porter. I got a shooting, plus a fire.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.722
- Mm. Any bodies?
- At least two, Projects on Avenue D.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.205
Paul said something about a kid.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.647
I'm on it. I'm on it. Thanks.

02:15.280 --> 02:19.445
I'm always running to the place
where the bad thing just happened,

02:19.520 --> 02:21.841
arriving just after the danger has passed,

02:21.920 --> 02:25.805
watching from a safe distance,
searching for an angle,

02:25.880 --> 02:28.042
that little wrinkle, the kick to the heart

02:28.160 --> 02:31.802
that makes you want to put down
the dollar and pick up the paper.

02:31.920 --> 02:35.887
With three deadlines a week,
I'm always looking for a good story.

02:36.560 --> 02:39.484
I seen the smoke,
and I'm looking up there.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.843
And that's when Demetrius,
he come jumping through that window.

02:42.920 --> 02:46.402
And he on fire, burning like all over.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.805
And he holding Vernon here.

02:48.880 --> 02:52.725
And Demetrius, he fall, fall, and fall.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.925
I can see he gonna land
on top of the baby.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.005
And then just before Demetrius land,
he do this little kind of flip.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.162
And he landed on his back.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.971
And he holding the baby up, like...

03:05.080 --> 03:07.924
And I can see that he do that on purpose.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.245
What did you do?

03:10.320 --> 03:13.210
I run over and I pick up Vernon here.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.844
And I see Demetrius.

03:19.040 --> 03:22.923
He just not gonna make it,
because he landed on his back like that.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.002
Hey, little man.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.725
I'm sorry that happened to you
and your daddy. You okay?

03:30.800 --> 03:32.325
No, no, no, he don't talk yet.

03:32.440 --> 03:35.364
Fall, fall, fall.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.003
Thanks for your time.

03:50.080 --> 03:54.244
Hey, you're the one that helped
them find that little girl?

03:59.040 --> 04:01.845
I write a column for a daily newspaper.

04:01.920 --> 04:05.481
In other words, I'm an endangered species.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.564
I used to think my stories
could make a difference.

04:08.640 --> 04:12.525
Now I just hope they are
enough to feed my family.

04:12.600 --> 04:17.562
These days, eight million kids have
iPhones and post their videos on YouTube

04:17.640 --> 04:21.005
like they're actually reporting
and commenting on something.

04:21.079 --> 04:23.965
My wife says I sound old.

04:24.040 --> 04:27.522
I'm heading into a long one,
so you'll probably get home before me.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.405
Josephine needs to get paid.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.765
And please remember to scrub
the pots and pans.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.125
You keep leaving them for me.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.850
Yeah, well, they have to soak overnight.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.564
Oh, yeah?

04:36.640 --> 04:38.165
- Yeah.
- Really?

04:38.280 --> 04:39.725
Is that what your mother told you?

04:39.840 --> 04:41.001
Well, look, I got to go, baby.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.320
- Wait, Porter.
- What?

04:42.400 --> 04:44.129
Did you remember your tuxedo?

04:45.280 --> 04:47.325
Yeah, but I don't want to go.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.125
Everyone's going to be
sucking up to Hobbs...

04:50.200 --> 04:53.926
You know, if they're really thinking about
cutting your column, you better go.

05:47.360 --> 05:51.604
I know you are a watcher,
Mr. Wren, but it is rude to stare.

05:51.680 --> 05:56.365
I'm sorry. I was just trying
to figure out where I knew you from.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.005
I see you recognize me, though.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.684
From your cheesy picture.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.684
The one that goes with my column.

06:02.760 --> 06:06.045
Your smug expression is annoying.

06:06.120 --> 06:09.005
It was taken last year,

06:09.080 --> 06:11.445
in the waning moments of my youth.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.204
Right before they retired the film camera?

06:13.280 --> 06:15.965
- Wow.
- Sorry.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.725
Does anyone actually read
the newspaper anymore?

06:18.800 --> 06:20.605
Well, I have a few fans
of the print edition.

06:20.680 --> 06:24.445
I'm told they Twitter at me.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.522
I think they Twitter
about how awesome it is,

06:26.600 --> 06:30.445
the feel of the paper,
the smell of the ink.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.409
Hashtag-well-written-column.

06:34.160 --> 06:38.484
Well... I do like the feel of the paper.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.803
And your column, Mr. Wren,
is always very well written,

06:41.920 --> 06:44.287
in an old-time, classic kind of way.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.245
- Well...
- I do wonder, though.

06:49.320 --> 06:52.765
It must be depressing for you
to be in all those places

06:52.840 --> 06:54.604
right after a terrible thing has happened.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.165
You must have seen so many awful things.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.402
I've seen a few things.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.245
People seem to open up to you.

07:02.320 --> 07:05.365
You must have a skill for
asking the right questions.

07:05.440 --> 07:10.281
Usually people want to tell somebody,
and I'm just there at the right time.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.328
Come on. You're being modest.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.365
What brings you to the party?

07:16.680 --> 07:20.722
My boyfriend, Charlie's bank,
does some kind of business with the company

07:20.800 --> 07:22.564
that I guess just bought your paper.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.525
You all work for Hobbs now, I guess.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.365
"All" meaning mankind? Yes.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.325
You grateful you landed a job
that pays you to stare at people?

07:39.440 --> 07:41.329
Look...

07:42.520 --> 07:44.645
I deal with bullshitters all day.

07:44.720 --> 07:49.605
But I'm on my own time here,
so, if this is all going somewhere,

07:49.680 --> 07:51.250
get to it already.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.965
Well, it's complicated.
It takes some time to explain.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.883
Oh.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.281
Could we leave right now
and go back to my apartment?

08:00.360 --> 08:03.325
It's only 15 blocks from here.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.562
Charlie wouldn't be coming.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.848
Is this about your husband's death?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.565
Porter Wren, is it?

08:12.640 --> 08:13.685
Yes.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.922
You must come and have
a word with Mr. Hobbs.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.764
He's quite eager to meet you.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.010
Excuse me.

08:31.960 --> 08:36.525
This is Porter Wren, the investigative
reporter who found the girl.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.965
Excuse me, Mr. Hobbs?

08:41.080 --> 08:46.402
Mr. Porter Wren, sir, famed investigative
reporter who now writes the column.

08:46.520 --> 08:47.965
Really?

08:48.040 --> 08:49.325
Yeah?

08:49.400 --> 08:50.965
I really think this could happen.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.371
I think it's very prudent.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.047
Every single...

08:59.400 --> 09:01.801
Wonderful.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.161
The invitation still stands?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.764
Yes.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.890
Come in.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.962
I want to show you this.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.004
Okay, this is what we're talking about.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.365
This is where we start.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.920
- This is where we start?
- Yes.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.446
- Another drink?
- Why not?

10:57.920 --> 11:00.526
To help you through the gates of hell.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.163
This is a police report.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.042
It's a bit stingy with the tonic and ice.

11:19.120 --> 11:23.525
Well, I want you drunk, so I can
tell whether you are a lout or not.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.001
You know you can get in a lot
of trouble for having these files?

11:27.920 --> 11:30.161
Detectives don't even let other
cops see these things.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.443
I know that.

11:33.520 --> 11:38.682
Okay. So, Simon Crowley was found
in the rubble of a demolished building.

11:38.800 --> 11:42.964
Surrounding the body were
small pieces of jade.

11:44.640 --> 11:48.162
Police have no idea how he got in there,
given the high fence with wire,

11:48.240 --> 11:51.847
nor can they determine the cause
of death because of the...

11:52.960 --> 11:55.565
The bulldozers
and the rats. You can say it.

11:55.640 --> 11:58.849
I've read the report 17 times.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.326
I'm sorry.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.322
"The world-famous filmmaker
appears incapable of smiling."

12:12.560 --> 12:14.403
Clearly.
"Several hours into the interview...

12:15.560 --> 12:17.685
I came to realize that Simon Crowley..."

12:17.760 --> 12:19.645
Thank you.

12:19.720 --> 12:24.965
"...is not a nice person, particularly,
and he doesn't care if you know it.

12:25.040 --> 12:29.725
In his pursuit of great movies,
woman upon woman, and cigarettes,

12:29.800 --> 12:32.883
in that order, niceness is irrelevant."

12:35.160 --> 12:37.003
Mixed review.

12:40.960 --> 12:44.681
- Is that Best Director?
- Best Original Screenplay.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.761
Apparently it's what they give you

12:45.840 --> 12:48.605
when they want to give you
Best Director but they can't.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.364
VANTAGES

12:50.440 --> 12:52.124
FILMMAKER CROWLEY FOUND DEAD

12:52.200 --> 12:54.245
They still can't figure out
how he got in there.

12:54.320 --> 12:57.369
The place was all locked up and
he didn't have a key on him.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.649
What's the story with the pieces of jade?

13:03.800 --> 13:05.404
No idea.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.282
Could I have my coat, please?

13:45.080 --> 13:48.004
I hope you don't feel like
I've wasted your time.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.531
Here's my number.

14:12.160 --> 14:15.881
When the gate shuts, my work and the city

14:16.000 --> 14:19.800
remain on the other side of the wall
that surrounds our hidden home.

14:19.920 --> 14:24.403
Lisa and I fell in love with this house
when we were first married.

14:24.480 --> 14:29.122
There's something about it surviving
hundreds of years, like a secret.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.440
It kept me honest.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.364
Anywhere else, this house
should be mundane.

14:35.440 --> 14:39.923
But in Manhattan, it was a miracle.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.845
My family slept inside, safe from
the dangers of these dark streets,

14:44.920 --> 14:49.605
secluded too from the world of Caroline
Crowley and her famous dead husband,

14:49.680 --> 14:52.285
who could not enter this sacred place,

14:52.360 --> 14:56.524
unless, of course, I brought
them home with me.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.445
Did you redo it yesterday?

14:58.520 --> 15:00.602
- It happened too late.
- Daddy-bird!

15:00.680 --> 15:02.045
Saved the wedding dress part just for you.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.325
All right. I'm on it.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.765
I'm on it. Thanks.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.642
Classy quote from the gymnastics coach.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.608
You see what they put for the headline?

15:15.280 --> 15:18.325
- The Pulitzer is waiting.
- I liked it.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.482
You okay?

15:20.560 --> 15:23.040
Yeah, I'll be all right in a few hours.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.445
You didn't drive home last night, did you?

15:24.520 --> 15:27.490
No. I left the car in the lot.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.485
Oh. Excuse me.

15:30.560 --> 15:34.201
- Sally, come. We need to get dressed.
- Oh, no, but I...

15:34.280 --> 15:36.282
- Tommy, let's go.
- Never!

15:36.360 --> 15:37.645
- Morning, Josephine.
- Tommy?

15:37.720 --> 15:40.121
- I don't wanna come.
- Tommy.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.680
Tommy. Don't you kick me.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.724
- Yes. I got him.
- Pick him up.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.405
There you go.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.365
You better come on with me.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.363
- Get your tush under control.
- Come on here.

15:53.440 --> 15:56.444
Josephine, if you could pick up
the house a bit today, it'd be great.

15:56.520 --> 16:00.685
Like, maybe you could do, like, the dishes,
or maybe do the pots in the sink?

16:00.760 --> 16:03.525
You know, she ignores me all the time.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.207
Oh, listen. I have an important surgery
that I have to do tomorrow night,

16:07.320 --> 16:11.484
so I won't be able to go to that
dinner with Lorca and Cabot.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.324
Well, I'm not going without you.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.641
We've rescheduled that, like, four times.

16:15.720 --> 16:19.850
I'm sorry. It's a visiting
Iranian ambassador with an emergency.

16:19.960 --> 16:23.165
Let's just stop pretending it's
effective to have a sex life.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.565
What?

16:24.640 --> 16:27.883
To schedule a night out, yeah?

16:35.480 --> 16:39.365
Do you need a ride somewhere
this morning, Mr. Grumpy Pants?

16:39.440 --> 16:42.005
- Yes.
- Where are you going?

16:42.080 --> 16:44.890
Upper West Side.

16:46.320 --> 16:47.845
Get dressed.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.165
Morning.

17:04.280 --> 17:08.204
I like the girl with the mob,
but I need some quotes about Iris.

17:08.280 --> 17:11.682
I'm going to reach out to her mother.
I'm going to try to track her down.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.962
- All right. Thanks, Bobby.
- Later.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.451
Yeah.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.969
Oh, God.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.325
Hello?

18:29.400 --> 18:31.685
Hey, it's Porter Wren.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.240
Well, hello, Porter Wren.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.525
How are you feeling?

18:35.600 --> 18:37.523
Did you roofie me last night?

18:37.600 --> 18:39.965
No, I didn't.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.168
Why are you calling me?

18:45.520 --> 18:48.410
"Opportunity only knocks once"?

18:55.640 --> 18:57.324
Hey.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.562
I just rode up the elevator
with Leonardo DiCaprio.

18:59.640 --> 19:02.041
Oh, yeah. He's got a friend upstairs.

19:02.160 --> 19:05.084
So, tell me how you met Simon.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.846
I was living a sort of tired,

19:08.960 --> 19:13.522
pretty girl, New York life,
you know? I had no money.

19:13.600 --> 19:18.125
I had given up on L.A.
after a year, and moved here.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.485
I was apartment-sitting for rich people,

19:21.560 --> 19:24.685
with no steady income or place to live.

19:24.760 --> 19:30.005
And I had just been fired for refusing
to date my asshole lawyer boss

19:30.080 --> 19:32.845
whose firm I was answering phones for.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.606
Did you have a laundry line hanging in
the backyard when you were growing up?

19:38.440 --> 19:39.521
Excuse me?

19:39.600 --> 19:42.485
You know, with jeans and t-shirts

19:42.560 --> 19:45.525
and underwear hanging in the backyard?

19:45.600 --> 19:47.090
A laundry line.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.441
Yeah, actually, I did.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.045
Me, too. I didn't like
my underwear hanging out there

19:52.120 --> 19:54.088
for the other kids to see,

19:54.200 --> 19:58.965
but I did enjoy my one friend's
mom's brassiere...

19:59.040 --> 20:02.681
- Right.
- ...hanging on their laundry line.

20:02.760 --> 20:07.483
He bought me a couple more drinks,
and we had an amazing conversation

20:07.600 --> 20:11.605
about our childhoods and parents.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.931
I knew who he was.
I recognized him right away.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.925
- He was very smart.
- Caroline.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.445
I'm going to ask you one, crazy question,

20:24.520 --> 20:26.405
but it's serious, not a joke.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.561
Okay.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.404
I want to marry you.

20:32.520 --> 20:35.485
Now, I know it sounds completely crazy,

20:35.560 --> 20:37.525
but I had just been sitting there thinking

20:37.600 --> 20:39.565
how I was probably going
to have to leave New York,

20:39.640 --> 20:44.362
and in walks this enigmatic, weird,

20:44.440 --> 20:45.771
brilliant human being.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.685
- Yes.
- Jesus. God.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.364
So, you met him in a bar.

20:52.480 --> 20:55.370
- Jesus.
- He proposed. You said yes.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.205
All within the span of less than an hour?

20:58.280 --> 21:00.485
Well, a few hours, but, yeah.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.561
Okay.

21:01.640 --> 21:03.085
I got a package from him the next day

21:03.160 --> 21:07.165
containing a flash drive
and an engagement ring.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.283
You want to see the video?

21:11.400 --> 21:12.447
Sure.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.645
Hey, Caroline.

21:16.720 --> 21:17.767
Hey.

21:19.520 --> 21:24.082
I've been thinking about you
since I left you earlier today.

21:24.160 --> 21:28.324
I was thinking about our, uh,
wedding vows and everything,

21:28.400 --> 21:32.883
and about how
the regular vows are, "I do,"

21:32.960 --> 21:35.122
and how that won't do, actually.

21:35.200 --> 21:38.965
So, I decided I want to make
my vows to you here, right now,

21:39.040 --> 21:41.405
this, this minute, exactly.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.642
And I have no idea what I'm going to say.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.563
But once it's done,
it'll be my vows to you, okay?

21:45.640 --> 21:47.605
So, after I said goodbye to you,

21:47.680 --> 21:51.002
I had dinner with, uh, Jessica Chastain.

21:51.120 --> 21:55.170
She wants to be in my next
movie, Strange Day.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.602
And she looks good.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.364
There was nothing wrong
with the conversation.

22:00.440 --> 22:04.684
She was very smart and funny,
and whatever,

22:04.800 --> 22:07.525
but she wasn't you, Caroline.

22:07.600 --> 22:11.207
I didn't get that "click" from her.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.766
I got the click from you.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.125
I got the click.

22:17.200 --> 22:21.243
When I was in high school, I got a job
as a busboy at this place in the Village,

22:21.360 --> 22:23.725
Dante's Café. But that was, uh,

22:23.800 --> 22:27.168
that was a big, big thing for me.

22:27.280 --> 22:31.602
I made some money and I got my first
camera, and I could watch all the people.

22:31.680 --> 22:34.923
There was this very beautiful
model who started coming in,

22:35.040 --> 22:37.645
her name was Ashley Montgomery.

22:37.720 --> 22:42.925
I would save her used cigarettes
with that perfect lipstick smudge,

22:43.000 --> 22:46.243
faintest trace of her perfume on them,

22:46.360 --> 22:48.405
and, when I got home,
I would lie naked in my bed

22:48.480 --> 22:52.685
and I would lay the cigarette
butts all over my body,

22:52.760 --> 22:56.321
even under my tongue, and even in
my ass, once, while I jerked off.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.004
I did not consider this strange.

22:58.080 --> 23:00.242
I'm sorry, is this still
his marriage proposal?

23:00.360 --> 23:03.364
- Yeah.
- I was certain that I would never...

23:03.440 --> 23:05.805
be loved, never.

23:05.880 --> 23:10.442
I swore that, if I ever had the
chance for somebody I loved,

23:10.520 --> 23:12.645
I would take it right away.
And when I saw you today,

23:12.720 --> 23:15.485
I saw a woman who could take it,
who could take me,

23:15.560 --> 23:18.404
who could fucking kick it back
at me, if she had to.

23:20.160 --> 23:23.482
This is my excitement...

23:25.520 --> 23:26.931
and my terror.

23:28.920 --> 23:32.129
My heart thrills to your heart, Caroline.

23:35.880 --> 23:38.087
My dark heart to your dark heart.

23:39.400 --> 23:43.200
That is my vow, Caroline, my vow to you.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.805
This is a song that makes me think of you.

23:49.560 --> 23:52.484
We were secretly married
in New York three days later.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.165
Showed a real affection for me.

23:56.240 --> 23:59.483
In the first six months, we were
surprisingly happy together.

23:59.560 --> 24:02.723
And this one night, when...

24:02.800 --> 24:07.124
when Simon didn't come
home, I got worried.

24:07.200 --> 24:11.330
But I didn't call the police because
I knew Simon would be pissed if I did.

24:13.360 --> 24:17.847
Three days went by, and it was pretty
clear then that something was wrong.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.251
Look, Caroline...

24:22.280 --> 24:28.009
if the police can't figure out how or why
Simon died, I honestly don't think I can.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.369
But you found that little girl.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.803
Don't people tell you all kinds of things?

24:34.880 --> 24:36.564
Honestly?

24:36.640 --> 24:40.165
I found that little girl by mistake.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.725
It was random luck.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.406
I didn't deserve any credit for that.

24:47.880 --> 24:50.963
Mostly, people tell me stories.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.842
I never press them.

24:54.920 --> 24:59.482
They just tell me 'cause
they want to be known.

25:02.240 --> 25:06.290
You seem to be searching
for something else.

25:06.400 --> 25:09.045
You had to know that by coming here today,

25:09.120 --> 25:11.726
I was going to ask for your help.

25:14.560 --> 25:19.009
Unless, of course, there was
another reason why you came by.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.725
I should go.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.447
Can I have my coat, please?

26:01.840 --> 26:03.490
Come on.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.402
Oh, shit.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.009
Caroline?

26:47.680 --> 26:49.250
Hello?

26:50.520 --> 26:52.565
It's just me.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.369
I forgot my phone.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.445
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.091
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my God.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.364
What are you doing here?

28:13.440 --> 28:15.165
I'm really sorry. I forgot my phone.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.365
- I'm...
- You scared the shit out of me.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.485
How'd you get in here?

28:19.560 --> 28:20.885
I saw... I saw the code.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.086
I'm sorry.

28:24.280 --> 28:26.760
You were watching me just now?

28:26.840 --> 28:28.888
I'm really sorry. I...

28:30.720 --> 28:34.122
You liked watching me, didn't you?

28:35.480 --> 28:37.005
I couldn't help it. I'm sorry.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.447
I was thinking of you.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.363
I got to go. I...

28:47.320 --> 28:49.561
Okay. Goodbye, watcher.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.007
Glad you got a good view.

28:55.480 --> 28:57.685
You know, you were right.

28:57.760 --> 29:01.321
Opportunity really only does knock once.

30:12.400 --> 30:15.927
Hey. I'm watching you, Caroline.

30:16.040 --> 30:18.168
I see everything.

30:53.600 --> 30:56.325
No, Tommy. Tommy, I need the washcloth.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.164
I need your face.

30:58.240 --> 31:01.244
I need your face. Just real quick.

31:01.320 --> 31:02.810
- Real quick.
- Daddy-bird!

31:02.920 --> 31:04.885
- Hello.
- Okay. Give me the washcloth.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.925
- How's my family, huh?
- Tommy, I need the washcloth.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.205
- Hey, you. Hi.
- Hi, sweetheart.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.282
Hello to you.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.488
I think Tommy peed in the tub again.

31:13.600 --> 31:15.965
Oh, Thomas.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.925
Honey, can you take care of it? Thank you.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.685
Sure. That's my cue,
after urination in the tub?

31:20.760 --> 31:22.330
Yeah, that's your cue.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.488
How was your day?

31:25.720 --> 31:28.445
Busy. Yours?

31:28.520 --> 31:29.681
Swell.

31:32.520 --> 31:36.645
I had awoke with the odd desire to visit
the site of the demolished building

31:36.720 --> 31:39.685
- where Simon's body had been found.
- Excuse me?

31:39.760 --> 31:44.322
537 East 111th Street
was now just a vacant lot.

31:44.400 --> 31:48.245
And it held no answers to the questions
that were troubling me.

31:48.320 --> 31:52.609
Did Simon die in the rubble or was he in
the building before it was demolished?

31:52.720 --> 31:55.485
And if he was in the building, why?

31:55.600 --> 31:58.922
And how did he get in there,
if he didn't have the key?

31:59.000 --> 32:02.083
In the building next door,
the super, Luis,

32:02.160 --> 32:06.045
didn't have anything to add since
the investigation 17 months ago.

32:06.120 --> 32:10.005
Any reason you can think of why
the victim might have a key?

32:10.080 --> 32:14.085
Sure. Lots of reasons. It's a big city.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.487
Thank you for your time.

32:20.400 --> 32:25.408
With my nagging guilt growing, I needed
some time to think this whole thing over.

32:27.840 --> 32:31.445
I told myself I'd never
see Caroline again.

32:31.520 --> 32:36.691
And yet, when she called,
I told her I'd meet her for lunch.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.082
Well, I don't feel guilty.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.961
You know, Porter, I'm actually
kind of alone.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.165
I have Charlie, but I can't talk
to him about everything.

32:49.240 --> 32:52.323
Simon is very much a taboo subject.

32:52.400 --> 32:56.405
Charlie's already started
looking at houses in New Jersey.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.645
White picket fence, garden in the back.

33:00.720 --> 33:03.121
Two-point-five kids?

33:06.880 --> 33:10.521
You're the only one that I can
talk to about any of this.

33:12.160 --> 33:17.644
And there's something that
I would like to show you, today, now,

33:17.720 --> 33:20.246
if you still have the time for me.

33:41.760 --> 33:43.603
You keep money in this bank?

33:43.680 --> 33:46.763
No. I keep Simon here.

33:46.840 --> 33:49.605
This, as much as anything,
was who Simon was.

33:52.560 --> 33:55.530
I'm going to need you to understand this.

33:57.120 --> 34:00.085
Simon was very unhappy all of his life.

34:00.160 --> 34:04.370
He was always...
"searching for the truth".

34:07.320 --> 34:12.125
On each of these video cards is some truth
that he was proud to have captured.

34:12.199 --> 34:15.409
And if he wasn't happy with it,
he would throw it out.

34:17.040 --> 34:20.283
He used to treat these like
original film in a camera.

34:20.360 --> 34:23.523
He would never reuse or copy them.

34:23.600 --> 34:26.284
He likes them being completely individual,

34:26.360 --> 34:29.364
as a single source of the truth.

34:31.199 --> 34:34.204
Okay. So, which do we watch first?

34:34.280 --> 34:38.080
I'm not staying. I'm sorry.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.402
I've seen them all so many
times, it's exhausting.

34:41.480 --> 34:44.609
I'll let them know up front
that you'll be here a while.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.686
Okay.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.681
Thank you, Porter.

34:50.760 --> 34:53.603
It's one of the weirder
moments in my life.

34:53.679 --> 34:56.206
Call me when you're done.

34:57.640 --> 34:58.971
Okay.

35:43.160 --> 35:45.288
- Stop.
- Really?

35:48.240 --> 35:50.641
There's one. Pull over. Pull over.

35:50.720 --> 35:53.085
All right, pull over, Max. Over.

35:53.160 --> 35:54.844
- Hey, hey.
- What's happening tonight?

35:54.920 --> 35:56.604
I'm cold and lonely out here.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.569
- We're lonely in here, too.
- Round the world is 200.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.281
She for you, Billy?

36:00.360 --> 36:02.325
Too ugly for me. Can't spend that much.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.965
She's not ugly. She's,
she's, she's plain, perhaps.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.281
She's nondescript, generic.

36:07.360 --> 36:09.124
Billy, it sounds like you're interested.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.005
I could be interested.
I could be very interested.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.241
What's your names? What's your names?

36:12.320 --> 36:15.925
- Billy. Simon.
- Oh, yeah.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.725
- Come on, Billy, Simon.
- I like her.

36:17.800 --> 36:18.961
Get in here.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.848
I don't know why I like
her, but I like her. Get in.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.485
She says something.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.925
She's in it. She says something.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.490
- Yeah.
- Hello.

36:35.720 --> 36:36.846
Simon?

36:37.840 --> 36:40.965
Hey.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.765
Can you let me in?

36:42.840 --> 36:45.320
I changed the lock.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.324
Okay, fine. Open the door.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.965
First you must answer me three questions.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.165
Jesus, come on, Simon, let me in.
I really have to pee.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.445
Three honest answers is all I require.

36:57.520 --> 37:00.325
Question one: When I'm in L.A.,
how often do you masturbate?

37:00.400 --> 37:03.370
Come on. Fuck you. Open the door.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.205
Jesus Christ.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.085
Every day, at least once.

37:10.160 --> 37:13.765
Question two: Have you ever
fantasized about being with Billy?

37:13.840 --> 37:15.725
Yes.

37:15.800 --> 37:18.445
Third question, please.

37:18.520 --> 37:22.365
Question three: When you finally
tracked down your biological father,

37:22.440 --> 37:24.325
what was the last sentence he said to you?

37:24.400 --> 37:26.445
Fuck you. I am not
playing this game anymore.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.405
Really? That's your choice.

37:28.480 --> 37:32.365
Come on. You already know the answer to
that question, you sick fuck. Open the door.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.725
I win.

37:34.800 --> 37:37.406
Oh, my God.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.684
He said, "You ain't my daughter.

37:40.760 --> 37:43.206
Now get the fuck out of
my sight. And when I..."

37:43.320 --> 37:45.561
The last thing he said.

37:45.640 --> 37:48.765
The last thing he said was,

37:48.840 --> 37:51.446
"Unless you want to give me a blowjob."

38:01.880 --> 38:03.803
You want to order some food?

38:03.880 --> 38:06.565
The fuck is wrong with you?

38:25.240 --> 38:27.402
- Yeah?
- Mr. Wren?

38:27.480 --> 38:30.845
This is Waldon Campbell
from Mr. Hobbs' office.

38:30.920 --> 38:32.684
He'd like to meet with you immediately.

38:32.760 --> 38:35.491
Himself?

39:01.560 --> 39:02.800
Excuse me.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.730
Hey.

39:37.720 --> 39:38.767
Fuck.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.484
Nice view.

39:53.600 --> 39:56.080
Mr. Porter Wren!

39:56.160 --> 39:58.845
Chronicler of people's woes.

39:58.920 --> 40:02.003
Good afternoon, sir. Good of you to come.

40:02.080 --> 40:05.323
Oh, do, please, sit down,

40:05.400 --> 40:09.925
since I'd like to discuss
a certain matter.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.206
Do sit down.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.642
You, sir, are having an affair
with Miss Caroline Crowley.

40:22.600 --> 40:23.761
That's of no...

40:23.840 --> 40:27.083
Please, please, please.
I ask you not to interrupt.

40:27.160 --> 40:33.281
Now, Miss Crowley has been
sending me a video

40:33.360 --> 40:35.805
on a digital card from a camera.

40:35.880 --> 40:39.805
It's the same one each time.

40:39.880 --> 40:41.525
What's on it?

40:41.600 --> 40:45.446
Something... very compromising.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.005
She's asking for money in return?

40:52.080 --> 40:53.684
No, no, no requests.

40:53.760 --> 40:59.164
Oh, she's bloody fucking
psychologically clever, you know.

40:59.240 --> 41:01.685
Are you certain
she's the one sending them?

41:01.760 --> 41:04.565
She is the only one who would

41:04.640 --> 41:07.291
logically be in possession of it.

41:08.200 --> 41:11.725
Okay. So, I ask her about it.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.005
And she tells me she's not sending it.

41:14.080 --> 41:17.125
And I look through her stuff,
and I don't find it.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.884
Then what?

41:18.960 --> 41:23.284
Then, you keep going, sir.

41:23.360 --> 41:25.806
You make do.

41:25.920 --> 41:27.565
Look, this is crazy.

41:27.640 --> 41:29.845
You are my employee.

41:29.920 --> 41:32.366
And I can have you fired and replaced

41:32.480 --> 41:35.609
in the time it takes me
to tie my shoelaces.

41:35.720 --> 41:38.644
I'm quite familiar with
your financials, sir.

41:38.720 --> 41:44.204
Your salary just about
covers your mortgage,

41:44.280 --> 41:49.725
and your wife provides all the rest.

41:49.800 --> 41:53.043
The firing would come with
embezzlement charges

41:53.120 --> 41:56.363
and a long, protracted lawsuit,

41:56.440 --> 42:02.163
which would oblige the bank to foreclose
on that charming house of yours.

42:02.240 --> 42:04.285
I can sell the house, Mr. Hobbs.

42:04.360 --> 42:09.365
You may have to, when your wife,
distressed with news of your affair,

42:09.440 --> 42:15.004
operates on someone with less
than her usual skill.

42:15.080 --> 42:20.120
Malpractice suits are the ruin
of many good doctors.

42:20.200 --> 42:21.765
Yes, yes.

42:21.840 --> 42:25.525
That's what you'll find motivating.

42:25.600 --> 42:28.805
You're famous for your
investigative skills.

42:28.880 --> 42:33.561
You found the little girl in the woods
when the best detectives failed.

42:33.640 --> 42:37.485
Too much limelight causes you to

42:37.560 --> 42:40.450
retreat to the comfort of a column.

42:40.560 --> 42:43.723
You're now a hack in need of a challenge.

42:43.800 --> 42:45.723
Oh, you were good once.

42:45.800 --> 42:52.046
And now you're going to have
to be good again, sir, for me.

42:53.880 --> 42:56.245
I had a funny patient come visit me today.

42:56.320 --> 42:57.885
Oh, yeah?

42:57.960 --> 43:01.407
She complained of basic
rheumatoid arthritis.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.604
Well, but you're a surgeon.

43:03.680 --> 43:06.923
I know, but she insisted
she stop in to be seen.

43:07.000 --> 43:11.805
I was surprised, because she was
only 28, and she was very beautiful.

43:11.880 --> 43:14.765
Might I add, she could have been a model.

43:14.840 --> 43:20.888
But anyway, so, I check her hands,
and she doesn't have arthritis.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.725
What does she have?

43:24.800 --> 43:26.365
Nothing.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.841
Her hands are perfectly healthy.

43:32.480 --> 43:35.085
- But she was in pain?
- So she claims,

43:35.160 --> 43:37.925
but I watched her fiddle with her purse
in the waiting room

43:38.000 --> 43:39.923
when I went out to get her,
and she wouldn't have been able

43:40.000 --> 43:42.885
to do that with what she was describing.

43:42.960 --> 43:46.643
Plus, when people are really in pain,
they beg me for something stronger

43:46.720 --> 43:48.449
than what they can buy over the counter.

43:48.560 --> 43:51.605
And she didn't even ask me for anything.

43:51.680 --> 43:54.405
So, you think she was making it up?

43:54.480 --> 43:55.965
I know she was.

43:56.040 --> 43:58.565
Sounds like a nut.

43:58.640 --> 44:01.530
She wasn't.

44:07.760 --> 44:10.161
Well, I can't talk about hands anymore.

44:10.240 --> 44:12.242
I need some other parts.

44:57.600 --> 44:58.885
Who the hell is that?

44:58.960 --> 45:00.689
It's no one.

45:30.480 --> 45:34.565
Dad. Hey, Dad. Is that
an old box you're repairing?

45:34.640 --> 45:37.962
No, you know, it's, it's a different
kind. One of these brand new ones.

45:38.040 --> 45:40.805
Dad, how long you been
in the elevator repair union?

45:42.200 --> 45:45.488
Yeah. When you left
South Dakota to track down...

46:51.720 --> 46:53.165
Simon?

46:53.240 --> 46:55.402
Jesus, fuck, Simon.

46:56.840 --> 46:58.922
Simon, wake up.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.565
Shit. Fuck, Simon.

47:01.640 --> 47:04.041
Oh, my God.

47:05.480 --> 47:07.323
Oh, fuck.

47:11.280 --> 47:13.245
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

47:13.320 --> 47:15.525
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

47:15.600 --> 47:18.524
My husband has overdosed
on some sleeping pills.

47:19.360 --> 47:22.645
Yeah, that's 411 East
Third Street, Apartment 12.

47:22.720 --> 47:24.685
Please hurry. No.

47:24.760 --> 47:27.885
No, I can't tell if he's breathing or not.

47:27.960 --> 47:30.884
Fuck. Just send an ambulance.

47:30.960 --> 47:32.925
Jesus, Simon.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.082
Fuck. Wake up.

47:35.160 --> 47:37.083
Simon?

47:37.160 --> 47:39.891
Simon? Come on.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.002
- Got you!
- Oh! Fuck!

47:42.080 --> 47:44.526
- I can't believe you came!
- The fuck is wrong with you?

47:45.240 --> 47:46.730
Holy shit.

47:46.880 --> 47:48.644
- You were amazing.
- That is not funny.

47:48.760 --> 47:51.445
- What are you doing?!
- This guy's fucked up.

47:51.520 --> 47:53.124
- What are you fucking doing?
- That was incredible.

47:53.200 --> 47:54.770
I actually called the fucking ambulance.

47:54.880 --> 47:58.123
- Asshole.
- Baby? That was...

48:12.960 --> 48:14.365
I'm making you a little drink.

48:14.440 --> 48:16.405
Easy on the roofies.

48:16.480 --> 48:19.927
You supposedly working
on your column right now?

48:20.040 --> 48:23.405
- Column's done.
- Is it noteworthy?

48:23.480 --> 48:27.121
Only for the fact that it might
be my most rushed one yet.

48:28.840 --> 48:33.403
Cop shot at home with his own gun,
by his 12-year-old daughter.

48:33.480 --> 48:35.164
Accident, of course.

48:35.240 --> 48:38.562
They deserve better
than the time I gave them.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.845
Look, I better tell you
I have an agenda here.

48:47.920 --> 48:50.366
I have an agenda, too.

48:52.800 --> 48:56.009
Maybe we can save 'em both for later.

49:12.080 --> 49:14.242
God, I'm so going to hell.

49:36.640 --> 49:39.644
Tell me why you have sex with me.

49:41.800 --> 49:43.131
No.

49:46.160 --> 49:48.725
Tell me how it's different
than with your wife.

49:48.800 --> 49:50.125
No.

49:50.200 --> 49:52.680
Your wife is attractive, right?

49:56.440 --> 49:58.647
I bet you know the answer to that.

50:00.720 --> 50:02.404
I bet I do.

50:05.240 --> 50:06.645
- Did you go?
- Yes.

50:06.720 --> 50:10.008
- To her office?
- Yes.

50:12.120 --> 50:13.360
Why?

50:13.440 --> 50:16.046
I was curious.

50:17.920 --> 50:20.725
She knew you were lying.

50:20.800 --> 50:23.365
- Yeah, I guess.
- It's not funny.

50:23.440 --> 50:26.364
That was an incredibly
fucked-up thing to do.

50:29.520 --> 50:30.965
I'm sorry.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.361
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Well...

50:35.960 --> 50:38.042
She's smart, Caroline.

50:39.040 --> 50:41.405
She's very, very smart.

50:41.480 --> 50:43.403
Smarter than me?

50:43.480 --> 50:45.765
Yes.

50:45.840 --> 50:47.080
How do you know?

50:47.160 --> 50:48.685
Because nobody's is smarter than my wife.

50:48.760 --> 50:50.842
Trust me. Believe me.

50:50.920 --> 50:56.086
Never make contact with her again.

50:57.400 --> 50:59.971
Ever. You understand?

51:02.840 --> 51:05.081
Yes. I understand.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.249
Okay.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.565
I'm going to ask you a question now.

51:13.640 --> 51:16.564
All right.

51:19.280 --> 51:21.169
Is she good in bed?

51:23.120 --> 51:24.605
Absolutely.

51:24.680 --> 51:27.126
She loves you, and you love her?

51:29.080 --> 51:31.082
Yes, very much. Yes.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.481
Then how is it different?

51:33.560 --> 51:36.643
Unless you have children,
it's hard to understand, I think.

51:36.720 --> 51:39.005
Try me.

51:39.080 --> 51:41.525
After you have children,

51:41.600 --> 51:44.331
death kinda gets into it.

51:45.520 --> 51:46.601
You know?

51:48.520 --> 51:53.003
Somehow you become aware
you're going to die.

51:53.120 --> 51:55.646
I didn't get that before I had kids.

51:57.360 --> 52:00.489
What happens if one of my kids dies?

52:02.840 --> 52:09.007
Anyway, it all sort of gets into the sex.

52:10.320 --> 52:12.125
It's complicated.

52:12.200 --> 52:14.680
Have you been with her
since our last time?

52:16.400 --> 52:17.890
Yes, last night.

52:19.480 --> 52:22.131
Did you think of me
when you were with her?

52:23.800 --> 52:24.801
Yes.

52:26.440 --> 52:29.842
I mean think of me
not just 'cause you felt guilty.

52:31.720 --> 52:34.925
- Yeah.
- I mean, you were fucking her,

52:35.000 --> 52:37.285
but actually thinking about fucking me.

52:37.360 --> 52:40.330
Yes.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.205
Do you look down at your wife
when you're fucking her and think,

52:50.280 --> 52:52.965
"I'm going to be with you until I die"?

52:54.640 --> 52:56.051
Yes.

52:56.160 --> 52:58.925
How do you feel about that?

53:02.640 --> 53:07.407
It's both comforting and
terrifying at the same time.

53:15.400 --> 53:16.526
Do you love me?

53:22.240 --> 53:24.811
Ever since the first moment I saw you.

53:35.680 --> 53:37.682
What are you thinking about?

53:44.120 --> 53:47.090
Trying to decide if it's better to

53:47.240 --> 53:49.846
snoop around your apartment
while you're not here...

53:51.360 --> 53:54.045
or ask you point-blank where it is.

53:55.480 --> 53:56.641
Where what is?

53:59.040 --> 54:02.362
Hobbs expects me to deliver a video
he believes you're sending him.

54:02.440 --> 54:05.489
Oh, fuck.

54:05.960 --> 54:08.964
- What?
- Oh, God, I don't fucking believe this.

54:09.040 --> 54:10.405
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

54:10.480 --> 54:12.765
I wanted you to find that video for me.

54:12.840 --> 54:13.966
What?

54:14.600 --> 54:16.602
They've been through my whole
apartment, my computer.

54:16.680 --> 54:17.805
They watch me everywhere.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.365
They've been threatening me
with all kinds of things.

54:19.440 --> 54:22.165
I don't have much time and I wanted you
to help me find that video.

54:22.240 --> 54:23.885
Wait, you know what's on that video?

54:23.960 --> 54:27.805
I've never watched it,
but I was there for the taping, yes.

54:27.880 --> 54:30.804
All right, come on, don't bullshit me.

54:30.880 --> 54:33.884
If you're not the one sending that video
to Hobbs, then who is, hmm?

54:33.960 --> 54:38.005
I don't know. I was hoping you
could find that out, too.

54:38.080 --> 54:42.688
Okay. Well, maybe you want to share
with me what the fuck is going on.

54:42.800 --> 54:47.203
It's not good.
Okay, you have to understand that

54:47.280 --> 54:51.490
Simon was always testing me. I became
like a science experiment for him.

54:51.600 --> 54:55.205
I'm willing to do anything you ask,

54:55.280 --> 54:57.601
as long as it doesn't
involve hurting someone,

54:57.680 --> 55:03.005
if you are willing to do anything I ask.

55:03.080 --> 55:05.445
Fuck you, Si. I can keep up with you.

55:05.520 --> 55:06.567
You can?

55:07.240 --> 55:08.401
So you accept the challenge?

55:08.480 --> 55:10.244
Yeah.

55:10.320 --> 55:12.368
So what do you want me to do?

55:19.840 --> 55:23.322
I want you to be holding the hand
of someone just as they die.

55:27.160 --> 55:29.083
Challenge accepted.

55:29.160 --> 55:30.605
I want you to have sex...

55:33.320 --> 55:36.608
with someone most unexpected.

55:43.360 --> 55:45.124
Challenge accepted.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.889
I'm gonna need proof.

55:56.200 --> 55:59.124
If you're really going to play
this kind of game, it gets really...

55:59.200 --> 56:05.285
interesting. It gets...
gets exciting, sort of.

56:05.360 --> 56:08.325
I don't know. Maybe I'm not explaining it.

56:08.400 --> 56:10.045
What?

56:10.120 --> 56:12.845
So, he set off with his camera
to be with somebody

56:12.920 --> 56:14.490
when they died in the
hospital or something,

56:14.600 --> 56:17.645
and then I set off with mine
to have sex with someone

56:17.720 --> 56:20.246
- "most unexpected."
- Meaning?

56:20.360 --> 56:22.124
Meaning like a cab driver
or a woman wouldn't do,

56:22.200 --> 56:24.645
because that's too predictable for Simon.

56:24.720 --> 56:27.485
You know, I always had to push back.

56:27.560 --> 56:30.803
Simon had a way of making me
want to show him everything,

56:30.880 --> 56:33.645
just to... just to see if it was enough.

56:35.400 --> 56:37.880
I sat down in the lobby to think.

56:37.960 --> 56:40.685
I could go to the Mayor's
place, Gracie Mansion.

56:40.760 --> 56:43.405
I thought of trying to get
to one of the Yankees.

56:43.480 --> 56:46.245
And then in walked Hobbs.

56:46.320 --> 56:50.291
I thought I recognized him from
the CNN report of his last mega-buyout,

56:50.400 --> 56:54.291
merger, whatever, but I wasn't sure.

56:54.400 --> 56:58.085
The bellhop confirmed he was
the billionaire media mogul Hobbs,

56:58.160 --> 57:01.289
and, 1,000 bucks later,
he gave me his room number.

57:02.520 --> 57:05.085
And you taped the whole thing.

57:05.160 --> 57:08.765
Yeah, it was easy. I just had my
camera peeking out from the purse

57:08.840 --> 57:10.524
that I left on the table.

57:12.480 --> 57:14.323
The next morning,
Simon tears into my purse,

57:14.440 --> 57:16.965
and he took the flash drive,
and he never let me see it.

57:17.040 --> 57:19.441
And he never kept his end
of the bargain up, either.

57:19.520 --> 57:22.285
And I fucking hated him for that.
I took a shower for, like, three hours

57:22.360 --> 57:26.645
and I promised myself I would never care
what Simon thought about me ever again.

57:26.720 --> 57:29.365
And then he saw the video and he
freaked out, and we had a big fight.

57:29.440 --> 57:32.085
And after he died, I thought that the...

57:32.160 --> 57:35.050
that the video would be in his
collection, and it wasn't.

57:36.440 --> 57:39.683
Look... why me?

57:41.720 --> 57:43.125
Come on.

57:43.200 --> 57:45.282
You know you're perfect for this.

57:45.360 --> 57:49.725
So, all this, between us?

57:49.800 --> 57:55.284
This is all for me to help you
get back some video file?

57:59.160 --> 58:01.003
Just tell me.

58:01.120 --> 58:02.565
Yes.

58:07.400 --> 58:11.085
- Do you forgive me?
- No. Or me.

58:11.160 --> 58:14.004
You have to understand that
initially I asked you for help,

58:14.080 --> 58:17.163
and then I got to know you
and I really liked you.

58:17.240 --> 58:19.685
Porter, you've got to believe me.

58:19.760 --> 58:21.842
Hobbs is serious about getting this video.

58:21.920 --> 58:24.045
He's going to take
everything away from me.

58:24.120 --> 58:26.725
You know, you're saying a lot of things,

58:26.800 --> 58:29.525
but you're not telling me
what I need to know.

58:29.600 --> 58:31.250
- I've told you everything.
- No.

58:31.360 --> 58:35.843
There is a reason why Hobbs is so adamant
about getting this flashcard back,

58:35.920 --> 58:38.241
because a guy his age would be
proud to have proof

58:38.320 --> 58:41.642
of fucking a woman as young and
beautiful as you without paying for it.

58:41.720 --> 58:44.285
And if Simon told you to go
have sex with somebody,

58:44.360 --> 58:47.842
there's a reason why he got so
upset when he saw the footage.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.923
So tell me the truth... now.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.885
Or I'm leaving.

58:52.960 --> 58:55.565
I've told you everything. I promise you.

58:55.640 --> 58:57.881
I promise.

58:57.960 --> 58:59.405
Please help me.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.604
Porter, please help.

59:02.680 --> 59:04.444
Porter, please.

59:20.560 --> 59:22.722
- Wren?
- Okay, okay, okay.

59:22.800 --> 59:26.122
What can I do for your fellows
on this lovely evening, huh?

59:26.200 --> 59:28.123
Give us the file.

59:28.200 --> 59:30.325
- I don't have it yet.
- Are you sure about that?

59:30.400 --> 59:32.482
- You just came from her apartment.
- Hey. What the fuck?

59:32.560 --> 59:34.847
How come you're not answering your phone?

59:38.320 --> 59:39.965
Do you want to sell to somebody else?

59:40.040 --> 59:41.685
I don't know.

59:41.760 --> 59:43.967
You think you can fuck with Hobbs?

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.282
Don't let us come back here tomorrow
and find it in your house, asshole.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.762
Please. Please.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.245
Jesus.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.322
Oh, I'm fine.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.643
- What the hell happened?
- I'm fine. I got jumped.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.005
It was only a matter of time.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.844
It was stupid.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.365
I didn't put my wallet away
while I was in the cab.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.965
I got mugged.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.123
I'm sorry.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.809
It was only a matter of time.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.687
You scare me when you say that.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.170
I'm sorry.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:33.846
Good morning.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.203
You have a furious wife,
you have blood in your piss,

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.567
and you still have a column due.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.603
But instead of doing your job,

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.002
you dig around and you find
that Simon Crowley's father,

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.731
Frank, lives in a nursing home in Queens.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.764
Mr. Crowley?

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:59.368
I'm a friend of Caroline's.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.608
I was hoping you could help me.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:11.365
Did Simon leave with you
a video camera, a memory card?

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:15.001
You know, a memory card?

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.848
Mr. Crowley?

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.524
Is he okay, though?

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.725
Okay. I'm on my way.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.484
I'm on my way.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.401
Paging Dr. Bender.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.922
How serious is it?

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.521
I examined the wound myself.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.605
The bullet pathway in the muscle
will leave scar tissue,

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.645
but not going through the entire depth.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:17.846
What does that mean?

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:22.040
It means that he will never have
the absolute contraction

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.361
in that muscle that he should have.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.245
- Josephine?
- It hit the left patella.

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.881
She'll need surgery and rehab.
It'll take at least a year.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.244
What the fuck happened?

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.803
What happened?

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.846
She rode with the kids in the ambulance.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.365
But the cop who was trying to get the story
said that she was pretty incoherent,

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:16.405
just that a man forced his way
into the house with a gun

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.926
and was searching for something.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.123
You know who the man was?

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.723
I have a good idea.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.963
I will not let my children
be a part of this, Porter.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.929
- No.
- Daddy?

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.005
Sally-bird. Don't cry, sweetheart.

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.525
Come here. Oh, Sally-bird.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.443
Everything's going to be all right.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:49.405
- How did I get here?
- No, sweetheart, you're okay.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:52.285
I'll tell you later.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.850
I'm taking the kids to my mother's.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.962
Sit up, baby.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.040
What about his arm?

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:02.165
They need this room. He's free to go.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.561
He can travel. I'll take good care of him.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.925
Here, you be careful
with this thing, okay?

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.162
Daddy, are you coming to Grandma's?

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.605
Such a good boy.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.565
Not on this trip, sweetie.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.085
Why?

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.165
- Come on, baby.
- Let me walk you to the street.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.565
I would rather you didn't.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.041
I don't know if I'll be able to
contain my rage that long.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.884
Come on, sweetheart.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:40.929
When your little boy has been even
grazed by a bullet, all bets are off.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.084
I needed to get to Hobbs.
And I knew that the only way

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.765
was through his gatekeeper, Campbell.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.526
I was now past being afraid of
what my desperation could do.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.525
Open the other door.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.002
- Take my wallet!
- Shut up. Get inside.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.844
Get inside.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.640
- Oh, God!
- Move!

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.121
Don't kill me, please.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.285
Do you know who I am?

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.085
- No.
- I'm Wren.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.083
Porter Wren.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.801
Your goons shot my little boy
this afternoon, did you know that?

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.609
Yeah.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.885
Which drawer has the sharpest knives?

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.325
Oh, God, no, please.

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.531
Which drawer?

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.605
Now, call Hobbs.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.405
I can't. He's in London.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.481
No...

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.605
No, we're going to tell him
to call off his goons.

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:44.762
He's unavailable. I swear.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.126
Start thinking, Campbell.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.325
My son is three years old.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.445
He is a perfect angel. He's innocent.

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.000
All right! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:08.523
0-11-44-955-646-7287.

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.405
Hobbs?

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.525
- Campbell?
- So sorry to wake you.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.126
Hobbs, this is Porter Wren.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.603
One of your goons
broke into my house today

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.285
and shot my three-year-old son
and his babysitter.

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:26.443
You listen to me, you motherfucker.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:30.680
If you do not call off your goons,
I will make 1,000 copies of that video

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:34.885
and I will send one to every newspaper,
every television station in the world.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.883
I will be a fucking wild man.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.564
I don't care. I don't give a shit.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.404
I will go down in a glorious ball of fire,

01:08:41.479 --> 01:08:44.484
and I will take you with me, you fat fuck.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.564
Now you call off your goons right now.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:52.085
You have a 24-hour grace period,
Mr. Wren. How about that?

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:56.365
Fail to hand me the master video when
I'm back in New York tomorrow evening,

01:08:56.439 --> 01:08:59.564
and your troubles today
will be longed for fondly

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:03.247
compared to the realm
you will find yourself in.

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:49.442
I don't know how
he got up there, but he did.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.602
- You're funny.
- Okay, Daddy? Dad?

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:55.965
Daddy? Tell me again how to make
the elevator run from the remote.

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.601
Out of the key paid
in the back of the panel.

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.125
Some dessert, Frank?

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.245
I know, the quick
patch or the boot patch, or...?

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.369
Boot patch. You need a boot patch
to complete the circuit.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.604
The camera annoys me.

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.725
What? What's the matter?

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.125
Frank doesn't like the camera.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.845
I know. Well, I got...
I'm going to go away tonight

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.525
for a little while, Dad, and I want you
on the camera, okay?

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.965
Okay, I'm going to go. I have to go.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.042
I have to pick up some medicines for Irv.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.884
Mrs. Segal, I need to get a key made.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:28.361
Can I get a ride with you to
the hardware store?

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.085
- Well, of course you can.
- Thank you.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.243
Dad? Dad. I'm going to say
goodbye now, okay?

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.163
Okay.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.965
- Me, too.
- Bye.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.520
- Okay.
- Mrs. Segal?

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:46.085
Would you mind if...
we had, you know, a minute?

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.003
Father/son moment?

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.844
Thank you.

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.485
- Say goodbye. Say goodbye.
- Yeah, I... I said.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.641
Okay.

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.364
Daddy?

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.845
Here's what I want you to know.
I want you to know that I never

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.684
blamed you for what happened...

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.081
for what happened to Mom, okay?

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.171
And no matter what happens now,

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.523
or tonight, I don't want you
to blame yourself.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.602
Okay?

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:24.401
And you watch this as many times
as you need...

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:29.561
until you accept
that that's the truth, okay?

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.329
I love you, Daddy.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.281
All right. Okay.

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.970
Mrs. Segal in the video
had to be Norma Segal,

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.605
a name I had noticed in
the nursing home guest book.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.725
She visited Frank Crowley
twice every week.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.405
I tracked her down
to an address in Queens.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:07.125
And, like Frank Crowley,
I was running out of time.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.645
And she was all I had.

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.121
Hello?

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.289
Hello?

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.728
Oh, my God, get out!

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.805
Get out. Get out. I'm calling the police.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.644
- Please don't. No.
- I'm calling the police.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.882
- No, please.
- No, don't touch it. No!

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.685
- Get out! Get out!
- Here.

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.485
Please don't hurt me. Just please go.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.765
Mrs. Segal, I'm desperate.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.161
Please, I'm sorry I entered
your house without permission,

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.685
but... I know it's wrong.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.485
I need your help, Mrs. Segal. Please.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.045
You know me? How do you know me?

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:34.726
- Do I know you?
- I'm Porter Wren.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.330
I'm a...

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.046
I write a column in the paper.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:46.165
I'm risking my whole career,
telling you who I am.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:48.288
And please, trust me.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.805
I read you all the time.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.605
I'm not here for the paper.

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:58.523
I promise I won't,
I won't write about this.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:59.647
I'm...

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.603
I'm trying to help Caroline.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.244
Now if you could just answer
a few questions for me,

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.525
I'd be incredibly grateful. Okay?

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:14.083
- Okay.
- Now, Simon was a family friend?

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:17.960
Yes. Simon was best friends
with our Michael growing up,

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.525
- when they were little.
- Oh, yeah?

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.523
They remained friends?

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.490
Michael drowned when he was eight.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.644
Simon still came over
every day after school,

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:33.085
because Frank was working and Simon's
mother had passed away already.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:37.051
He became like a replacement son
for us, you could say.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.084
Now, you were visiting
Frank Crowley, Simon's dad,

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:45.805
and billing the estate, right?

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:51.245
Yes. Simon had his firm
send us $2,000 a month,

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.605
once he started making money,

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:56.285
because he wanted to take care of us.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.964
I was very uncomfortable with it.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.765
I thought, I thought we
should earn the money.

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:05.244
So, I was visiting Frank twice
a week at the home.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:09.371
Frank and I've become close
over the years.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.885
So, I started billing the firm

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.204
for those visits by sending invoices
on Irv's legal stationery.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.404
Would you... Would you like to sit,

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.323
and... and go downstairs?

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.365
Sure.

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.245
- Sorry.
- That was very scary.

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.890
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.685
Now, what about
those other $5,000 payments?

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.325
Oh, that was something different.

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:44.964
Simon said he had a job for me,
for which he would pay $5,000.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:48.925
He told me to bill the firm,
to send something to a third party.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.765
He said to write the invoice
on legal letterhead like I had before.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:57.003
Was it a camera memory card?

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:01.041
Yes, it was a video camera card.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.805
He gave me this whole box of
little plastic things.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:08.601
I don't know what was on it.
I didn't look at it.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.725
Simon told me, if we needed cash,

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:14.122
follow the same instructions,
mail one of them,

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.283
and bill the firm. It was remarkable.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.202
Remarkable.

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:22.362
Mrs. Segal, I need that box of copies.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.762
Oh, no, no. Simon made me promise
not to give it to anyone.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.569
No, no, you keep billing the firm.

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:30.610
You just... You can't send them anymore.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.365
Really?

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:37.403
Because I'm down to my last one,
and I was wondering how to make more.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.882
I need that video card.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.765
Such a small, little thing.

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:48.810
I have no idea what could be on it.

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.764
I'm much heavier than I should be.

01:18:54.840 --> 01:19:00.882
And I'm quite incapable of
normal sexual function.

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.365
Can't have sex?

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.761
There are other things in life.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.365
There's something that
you're not telling me.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:10.764
- Well...
- Well, don't be embarrassed.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.565
You can tell me anything,

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.725
and I can take whatever it is
and keep it locked up.

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.765
Well...

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:24.685
Well, it happened a very...
a very long time ago.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.604
Too long to keep inside of yourself?

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:31.924
It was summer, before my final
year at university,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.205
and I decided to work on a freighter.

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:40.045
I was the son of one of
the richest men in Australia.

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:43.885
I took the job just to spite my old man.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:47.485
Anyway, we had a week's shore
leave in Marseilles.

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:51.005
Something tells me there's a
woman involved in this story.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.885
As beautiful as you are.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.760
She was the most expensive
prostitute in Marseilles,

01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:01.641
and I... I did something
stupendously stupid.

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.165
And what is that?

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.447
Well, I fell in love with her.

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.124
And I gave her my last franc

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:16.964
just to be able to look into her
eyes for a few minutes longer.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:20.045
It broke me up to say goodbye.

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.600
I kissed her,

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.603
told her I loved her,

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:29.083
and flew down those dark
streets to the port.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:34.041
Suddenly, some of the regular
Marseille sailors

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:38.523
caught up with me
and beat me up, pretty badly.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:42.321
One of them stuck me
with a knife, in the groin,

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:45.205
at least... at least a dozen times.

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.645
And they... and they left me for dead.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.802
Oh, my God.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.645
Well, my manhood was severely wounded.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.644
I... in fact...

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:00.241
In fact...

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.846
I was butchered.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:10.205
Well, I went to the best doctors
in the world, but some things...

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:13.204
Well, some things, you can't fix.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.480
And I was 20-years-old.

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.725
May I see?

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:27.485
Good God, it's far too embarrassing.

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.891
Please.

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.401
Show me.

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.085
Show me.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.883
You're not repulsed by me?

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:06.724
No.

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:13.323
I think you're sweet.

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:24.886
I'd like to tell you a story now
that I've never told anyone before.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.130
It's about when I was a little girl
and I really wanted a horse.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.085
And every day, I would ask
my stepfather for this horse.

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:38.004
I used to beg him, so much...

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:52.081
Good God.

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.769
That's terrible.

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:09.409
I want... I want to do something...

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:14.643
for you.

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:20.365
I'd like... so very much...

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:22.681
to kiss you...

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:28.886
in... a special place.

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:36.445
Am I...

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:38.807
Am I allowed...

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.804
to do that?

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.685
I don't mind if you say no.

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.603
You're allowed.

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:47.645
You sure?

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.529
Yes.

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:39.485
Oh, my God.

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.685
Mr. Wren.

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.321
Can we behave like gentlemen this time?

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:22.609
I'm much heavier than I should be.

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:27.442
And I'm quite incapable of normal sex...

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:32.245
Oh, I'd like to ask you three questions.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:33.645
Shoot.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.565
Was Miss Crowley sending
these video cards?

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:40.803
- No.
- Then who was?

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:46.046
An innocent woman, taking orders
from Simon Crowley.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.605
Did she watch the contents?

01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.485
- No.
- Did you?

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.403
That's four questions.

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.605
Please indulge me.

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:58.048
And I'll, I'll share something with you.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.841
Yes, I watched the video.

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:06.561
Aren't I a lovely sight?

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:12.001
I've been holding onto
this for a long time.

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:17.165
And in the spirit of
"all's well that ends well,"

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:20.365
I'd like to... to give it to you.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:23.364
We did gain access
to Ms. Crowley's apartment,

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.603
and I am sure she suspects something.

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:29.565
- She does.
- We were looking for the video.

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:32.120
And we looked at all her keys,

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:37.809
and we identified every one,
except that one.

01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:41.845
I could've left it there, walked away,

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:44.321
tried to put my life back together.

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.404
But there were still too many
questions about Simon's death.

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:51.963
And the truth is this key could
unlock the secrets of Caroline.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.805
She was a mystery I could not
walk away from.

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.565
Can I help you?

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.285
Hey. It's Porter.

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:05.445
Back in the day, I used to
deliver coal to both buildings,

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:08.091
through this basement.

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.845
The one next door that they demolished
was identical to my building.

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:19.084
You see, both buildings are
exactly the same.

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.885
Does the demolition crew
inspect the elevator

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:31.485
before they send it to the basement?

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:34.723
The one next door was already in
the basement, didn't need to be dropped.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.165
And the cops who
investigated Crowley's death,

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:40.445
they couldn't search
the elevator, could they?

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:43.085
Because it was under 20 feet of rubble.

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:46.045
What would they be looking for?

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.441
It's just an elevator.

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:41.364
Yo! Throw the rope!

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:53.405
- What?
- Feel that?

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:17.121
Why have you been buying milk lately?

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:20.090
They're going to demolish this
tomorrow morning.

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.845
Well, can we make it quick?

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.763
It's creepy in here.

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:04.651
All right?

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.763
Yeah. You know, I'm going
to wait downstairs.

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:10.842
- This is too weird.
- Here.

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:14.641
Caroline? Come talk to me.

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:17.963
Why is this elevator not working?
I want to go downstairs.

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.804
Hey, come. Come talk to me.
I'm your husband.

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:23.763
Come talk to us.

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.805
Why do you have my horse?

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:46.845
It's an item of marital interest,
wouldn't you say?

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:49.885
This old treasure
is about 1,000 years old.

01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:51.925
Your phone's not gonna work, baby.
I took out the SIM card at home

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.365
and put it under your pillow.

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:57.883
It's made of jade, from the Zhang Dynasty.

01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:03.325
And it's worth about
$1.8 million, I found out.

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:06.643
So, obviously, Mr. Hobbs appreciates you.

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:09.485
He appreciated you with
his tongue, we know that.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:14.441
He appreciates your little horse
story that you told him,

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.921
to give you a gift like this.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:20.688
Made you feel like you have a real daddy?

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:23.451
Made you feel safe, Car?

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:28.208
Tell me the story.

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.361
I'm not telling you the story.

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:33.885
- It's locked.
- We're leaving.

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:37.567
No, we're here.
All the doors are locked, babe.

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:40.525
Fuck.

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:46.330
We are not leaving until you tell me the
story, exactly the way you told it to him.

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:54.285
Okay.

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:58.524
Well... I guess we'll stay the night.

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:01.805
Seriously. I am prepared
to wait all night.

01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:03.325
I have my milk.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.881
And if you have not told me
the story by the morning,

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:13.325
we can be demolished
along with this building,

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:16.609
and our bodies can be
crushed by the rubble,

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:19.485
and we'll be compressed into dust.

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:23.005
I'm never telling you
that fucking story, okay?

01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:24.730
Ever.

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:35.285
Jesus, what the fuck are you doing?

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:38.085
Well, I'm breaking the expensive horse.

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:40.811
This key will bring the elevator back.

01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.206
So...

01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:44.645
- Give me the key.
- Give me the story.

01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:47.041
No. Just give me the key, Simon.

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:57.008
Actually, that's, um,
that's our postal box key.

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:02.527
This key is the one that unlocks
the padlock around your ankle.

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.324
How about that story now?

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.770
- I fucking hate you.
- I fucking love you.

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.844
The more you resist,
the harder it's going to be.

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.644
So, tell me the story.

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:24.841
No?

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.603
No?

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:33.202
Okay, 'cause of that, I'm going
to have to drink my milk here.

01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:36.887
I've been practicing drinking milk.

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.281
It'll help me swallow keys.

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:44.561
Son of a bitch.

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:46.688
Don't swallow the key.

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.167
Please don't. Please. Please stop.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.445
So now you control your fate.

01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:12.245
Tell me the story, so I won't
send the elevator down,

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:15.365
because, if I send it down
to the basement,

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.805
there's no way for it to be down
there and you to still be here.

01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:20.360
I'm not telling you the story.
Just stop this, please.

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:23.370
Last chance. I'll start it for you.

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.525
When I was a little girl...

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:28.001
- Please don't.
- I really wanted a horse.

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.605
Just tell the story and I won't
push this button, okay?

01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.682
I don't want to tell the story.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.805
No. Stop.

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.245
Shit, Simon, fuck.

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:43.765
Is your pathetic story really worth this?

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:48.525
No. No, please, stop. Stop the elevator.

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.523
Tell me the fucking story!

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:53.285
Why aren't you trying to stop this thing?

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.921
Okay. When I was a little girl,
I really wanted a horse.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.885
- Okay.
- I begged my stepdad for one every day.

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:04.249
- Fucking stop.
- Too late. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:12.245
Hi. Okay.

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.525
So, I rigged it to stop.

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.604
I thought for sure you would
tell me sooner.

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:29.691
Anyway, so, yes. "My stepdad,
every day, I asked him," and?

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:44.001
Jesus.

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.564
Oh, God.

01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:19.725
Simon?

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:21.006
Please...

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.045
Hello.

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:35.005
Please tell me
that you found the Hobbs tape

01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:37.003
- and that you returned it.
- I did.

01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.205
What? You did, really?

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:42.325
- Where was it?
- I'm sorry. I can't talk now.

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:44.721
Well, can we have breakfast?

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:46.325
I'd like that.

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.285
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:00.688
Have you been rolling around in the mud?

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:03.925
It's a long story.

01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:06.645
Well, I like long stories.

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:08.685
Before you tell me everything,

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:11.889
there is something
that I would like to show you.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.081
Congratulations.

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.245
Thank you.

01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:25.767
I've got some things to show you, too.

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:35.167
It's beautiful.

01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:37.725
What is it?

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:43.565
Don't lie to me now, Caroline.

01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:51.124
Simon threw it and broke it.

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.804
Yes.

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:01.285
You used the padlock from your ankle

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:04.405
to lock the basement door
so no one would find the body.

01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:06.125
Porter...

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.281
Did you know...

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:11.523
it was all on camera?

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.684
Every second.

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:19.244
Moment by moment.

01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.402
This is a copy for you.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.561
The original is somewhere
you will never find.

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:39.445
If you ever contact my wife in any way...

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.443
I see.

01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.003
Keep me in check.

01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:51.243
Will you tell it to me?

01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:56.244
The horse story?

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:05.560
When I was nine, I really wanted a horse.

01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:10.645
And my stepfather, Ron,

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.724
was not into giving me one.

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:19.244
And my mother was so powerless
in the relationship

01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:23.291
that she didn't even bother
to argue for me.

01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:31.764
As my birthday got closer, I used to beg

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:35.365
and beg for that horse.

01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:38.489
And every time I begged, Ron
would slap me across the face.

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.129
It would only make me
beg more the next day.

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:49.090
One night he came into my room
and he said,

01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:51.846
if I could keep his visit a secret...

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:56.205
and if he could do whatever he wanted,

01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:59.489
then he would buy me
a horse for my birthday.

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:05.281
And this went on for about a week.

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:12.041
And when my birthday rolled
around, there was no horse.

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:14.325
So, that night, when he came into my room,

01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:18.566
I told him that I was going to go tell
my mother what he had been doing to me.

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:25.886
And he promised me that
he'd kept his end of the deal...

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:32.407
and that there would be a horse
waiting for me the next day.

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:06.561
Happy birthday, Caroline.
Here's your horse.

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:35.205
Why did you look in the elevator?

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:38.363
I think you wanted me to, Caroline.

01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:43.723
Goodbye, Caroline.

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:48.125
Well, don't just go.

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:50.441
Say something to me.

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:55.010
Be well.

01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:59.491
As well as you can be.

01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:17.045
The ugliness of who
I've been and who I am now

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:21.444
is strongest when I get to see
my wife and children.

01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:24.285
I never told Lisa the truth,

01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:28.081
choosing instead to let her
imagine the worst of me.

01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:31.084
I think she decided that
whatever was in me now

01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:34.925
was dark and ugly
and better left where it was,

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.209
as long as it was not near her
or the kids.

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.885
What was I doing here?

01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:50.565
Maybe because it made me feel safer

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:53.610
to know Caroline was far away from me,

01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:59.164
as if I alone were not responsible
for the wreckage to my marriage.

01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:05.611
Maybe to see her in a new life
would bring me some kind of closure.

01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:12.324
Maybe I'm just feeling stupidly
sentimental, like the asshole that I am.

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:25.763
As the old reporter told me
on my first day,

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:28.764
"It's all one story, kid.

01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:33.202
It's all one big story."
