WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.367
Me and Tilly have been
needing a gunman.

00:03.520 --> 00:05.329
Now we've got ourselves one.

00:05.480 --> 00:06.811
I want
Frank Green's blood!

00:06.960 --> 00:08.405
Don't come on my property or I'll shoot!

00:08.560 --> 00:10.528
Go on, shoot! I've got
plenty of mates with me!

00:12.400 --> 00:13.242
Your highness!

00:13.400 --> 00:15.209
My beautiful boy.

00:16.560 --> 00:18.369
Tilly! Jesus!

00:18.520 --> 00:19.851
You lost the baby.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.765
I wanted that baby so much!

00:24.400 --> 00:25.640
Thanks, mister!

00:25.800 --> 00:27.609
A whirlwind romance, I'm afraid.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.888
It's tradition for you
to ask my permission first.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.724
Maybe we would have
if you weren't in jail.

00:31.880 --> 00:35.043
You are about to enter into a union
that is most sacred.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.850
Where to?
You know where.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.446
You're too late, lady. Wedding's over.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.284
Couldn't have stopped it anyway.
She's legal age.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.886
I just wanted to be at
my daughter's wedding.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.327
I'm her mum.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074

01:47.400 --> 01:49.402
Three cheers
for the happy couple. Hip hip!

01:49.560 --> 01:51.528
Hooray!
Hip hip!

01:55.040 --> 01:56.530
Tiny!

02:02.360 --> 02:04.966
Just a little something
for your big day.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.327
Oh, thank you!

02:12.440 --> 02:13.930
Sweetheart!

02:28.920 --> 02:30.922
Sorry I missed you at the church.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.171
Congratulations.

02:38.360 --> 02:39.691
Both of you.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.286
Tilly brought me a present.

02:42.440 --> 02:45.205
Mmm, so I see.

02:50.160 --> 02:53.164
Oh, it's beautiful!

02:53.320 --> 02:54.651
Oh, it's nothing.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.691
I'm sure your mother got you
something much more grand.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.611
A house.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.529
Whoa-hoa!
Really?!

03:08.120 --> 03:11.203
Yeah. Well, a few details to sort out.

03:11.360 --> 03:14.011
But, yeah. House on the beach.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.685
Four bedrooms.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.605
Four!
Enough for all my grandkids.

03:19.880 --> 03:22.360
That's what you done,
didn't you, Tilly?

03:22.520 --> 03:24.761
House big enough for all
your kids and grandkids?

03:26.200 --> 03:31.081
That's right.
Did you hear that, Bertie? A house!

03:32.560 --> 03:34.130
So generous.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.090
I'm sure your mother will
have you moving in tonight.

03:37.240 --> 03:40.403
Like I said -few details to Work out.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.562
They'll stay with me
for a couple of days.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.404
Cosy.

03:44.560 --> 03:45.891
Well, I won't keep youse.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.566
Thank you for coming.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.443
Pleasure, darling.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.041
You don't have to knock.

04:17.040 --> 04:20.567
Uh... I, uh, just wanted to thank you...

04:21.920 --> 04:24.048
for, uh, for being so generous.

04:25.680 --> 04:26.522
The house.

04:26.680 --> 04:31.322
And I know you weren't exactly thrilled
about our union,

04:31.480 --> 04:34.051
but I wanted to let you know
that I'll look after your daughter.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.171
Yeah. Yeah, I bet you will.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.288
With my money.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.886
Well, that doesn't matter now,

04:43.040 --> 04:46.328
because she's my wife
whether you like it or not.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.641
Ma!

04:51.760 --> 04:54.081
You couldn't be happy for me
for one day!

04:55.200 --> 04:56.326
Eileen...

04:56.480 --> 04:58.005
Eileen!

05:00.440 --> 05:02.283
What was all that about?

05:06.040 --> 05:07.451
ă100.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.965
What?

05:09.120 --> 05:12.044
On the heads of Frank Green
and Jim Devine.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.009
Kate...
That bitch!

05:14.160 --> 05:16.367
She killed Greg, she destroyed Bruce

05:16.520 --> 05:19.410
and she comes in here, to my joint,
on the day of my daughter's wedding,

05:19.560 --> 05:21.005
brings a fucking punchbowl!

05:21.160 --> 05:24.050
I want ă100 on their head, Wally.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.850
I want her fucking dead.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.729
You hear me?

05:27.880 --> 05:30.724
I don't wanna see those maggots
walking this fucking city ever again!

05:30.880 --> 05:32.405
I want 'em in the ground!

05:36.120 --> 05:37.451
100?

05:37.600 --> 05:38.965
For each of them?

05:39.120 --> 05:40.451
Word on the street.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.410
Take a copper half a year to earn that.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.767
She's serious?
Devines think she is.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.605
Word is that they're holed up at
Maroubra with a stockpile of weapons.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.489
Oh, Christ almighty.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.086
We could just let 'em sort it out.

05:53.240 --> 05:54.651
And have a bloodbath
on our hands?

05:54.800 --> 05:56.165
If they all shoot each other...

05:56.320 --> 05:57.651
Kate's motifs decimated -

05:57.800 --> 06:00.770
who's she got left, Wally Tomlinson
and Barney Dalton?

06:00.920 --> 06:02.809
Maybe let 'em all go down to Maroubra.

06:02.960 --> 06:06.362
Maybe let everyone fire off a few shots.

06:06.520 --> 06:09.126
Anyone that's still alive, we lock 'em up.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.601
We finish this once and for all, Bill.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.530
I won't say I'm not tempted.

06:25.680 --> 06:29.366
The number of men out there that'd
eat the concrete footpath for a pound.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.570
For 100, God knows how many
are beating a path to Maroubra.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.403
No.

06:37.560 --> 06:38.925
We do this the old-fashioned way.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.683
Open the door!

07:07.800 --> 07:08.642
Sit down!

07:08.800 --> 07:10.802
What do you wanna do,
come here and get guns?

07:12.920 --> 07:15.207
who you're messing with!

07:15.360 --> 07:17.362
You better sleep with
one eye open, mate!

07:17.520 --> 07:20.410
That's a Ł12.50 pound fine
for each firearm.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.005
12.50!

07:22.160 --> 07:24.401
It's not even mine. Belonged to
the previous owner of the house.

07:25.920 --> 07:29.606
Mate, that's my service rifle. Brought it
back from Flanders. You can't take that!

07:29.760 --> 07:31.808
That's another 12.50.
Detective Sergeant!

07:31.960 --> 07:33.962
Who owns the pistol?

07:34.120 --> 07:36.088
OK, it's mine.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.571
I have to keep it, Wickham.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.722
After Gaffney, someone might
back up on me any time.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.724
Kate Leigh's got a bounty on his head.
You can't leave us here undefended.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.645
So you go after their mob instead?
Don't think so.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.246
Fucking write it down.
Go on, another 12.50.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.880
And on your heads if they come
and murder us in our beds.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.929
Nuh, no fine.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.048
What time is it, Syd?
I reckon it's about midnight.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.363
Midnight? The sun's fucking shining
in the window, you gormless nong!

08:00.040 --> 08:03.362
Jim Devine, you're under arrest for
discharging an unlicensed pistol

08:03.520 --> 08:04.851
between the hours of...

08:05.000 --> 08:06.331
it's licensed!

08:12.320 --> 08:13.890
My husband bought that gun

08:14.040 --> 08:17.010
the day we landed in
this godforsaken dump in 1920.

08:17.160 --> 08:20.926
So you leave him and it
and fuck off out of my house.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.647
What's the total?
ă50.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.330
By the end of the day.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.282
Hooroo...

08:36.799 --> 08:41.089
She'll pay for this. Kate Leigh
and her stupid fucking bounty!

08:41.240 --> 08:42.809
I'll show her.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.562
We get in first.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.882
You get her men
before they can get you.

09:31.840 --> 09:32.727
Where are you going?

09:32.880 --> 09:34.245
Work.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.801
Gotta see a man about
blowing his head off.

09:36.960 --> 09:41.090
And I suggest you get that cute little tail
out on the street

09:41.240 --> 09:42.730
and wag it around.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.289
I think I wanna go dancing.

09:46.440 --> 09:50.365
Sweetheart, we need the dough.

09:50.520 --> 09:55.208
Well, I could stab you
with a knitting needle,

09:55.360 --> 09:56.691
and Kate Leigh'd give me ă100.

09:56.840 --> 10:00.447
Lucky for me
you're not a knitter.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.090
There's no customers anyway.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.047
It's these times -
fewer people can afford me.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.611
Well, lower your price.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.001
What?!
We need the money.

10:11.160 --> 10:15.370
That fur ain't exactly cheap,
and rent on this place is a quid a week.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.568
I make over a quid a day.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.370
Only if you can get customers.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.763
Isn't Tilly paying you?

10:28.600 --> 10:34.130
If Kate Leigh will pay Wally and Barney
that much to get you and Jim...

10:35.360 --> 10:37.966
surely you can make Tilly match it.

10:46.600 --> 10:51.561
You shoot them... you get ă100.

11:01.120 --> 11:04.920
Stocks are down. We need more men.
Should be able to get them cheap.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.481
Kate, relax.
We're in trouble, Wal.

11:07.640 --> 11:10.530
Yeah, we're gonna be in more
if we start tiring off at Tilly's boys.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.001
If I don't do something about
that bitch now, I'm finished.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.207
Kate, just...

11:15.960 --> 11:18.804
Just-.. look-..

11:18.960 --> 11:21.042
You know I'd do anything for you, right?

11:21.200 --> 11:23.646
But I gotta know where we're at.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.689
You've gotta know how I feel about you.

11:28.840 --> 11:33.368
I need to know if you feel the same way.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.126
Eileen!

11:38.600 --> 11:40.364
You get Barney
and you End Frank and Jim

11:40.520 --> 11:42.363
and you finish this
once and for all, alright?

11:47.800 --> 11:49.165
Where you been?

11:49.320 --> 11:50.810
With my husband.

11:52.680 --> 11:56.730
Eileen... I only want you to be happy.

11:56.880 --> 11:59.406
I am happy, Mum.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.927
Then I'm happy for you.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.608
What's done is done.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.251
Don't go.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.846
We're staying in a hotel until
our house in Clovelly's ready.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.407
Please stay. This house is your house.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.602
And Albert's.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.931
Yeah.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.651
And Albert's.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.371
She's sorry. She really is.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.602
It's just her way.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.406
I'm having a baby, Bertie.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.487
Is it mine?
Of course!

12:57.280 --> 12:59.169
Does your mother know?
Nuh.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.971
It's between you and me.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.882
Ain't love grand?

13:23.200 --> 13:25.168
Love's for the weak.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.362
In Sydney in 1929,

13:28.520 --> 13:31.603
Kate Leigh wasn't the only one
with problems.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.001
The 20's had stopped roaring.

13:34.160 --> 13:38.688
The stock market had crashed and
unemployment was starting to skyrocket.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.320
And Kate's war with Tilly Devine -

13:41.480 --> 13:44.484
that was about to go up a notch.

13:44.640 --> 13:48.440
I hear Frank Green's shitting himself
that you blokes are coming after him.

13:48.600 --> 13:52.241
He better be wearing his brown
union suit, then, eh?

13:52.400 --> 13:55.802
So I was thinking, there's no money
in going after them down there.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.291
Not after last time.

13:57.440 --> 14:00.330
Bloody Big Jim and his.303,
he'll pick us off

14:00.480 --> 14:03.370
like he did you and Gaffers.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.488
So we wait for them to come to town.

14:07.640 --> 14:08.971
Are we really gonna do this?

14:09.120 --> 14:10.929
Yeah!

14:11.080 --> 14:12.411
For Gaffney, mate.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.891
Hang the hundred quid.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.363
When was the last time you saw a tree?

14:19.520 --> 14:20.362
What?

14:20.520 --> 14:22.409
A really big tree - yellow gum, river gum.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.847
Giant. You know, bigger than a building.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.288
Round here, it's just
bricks and concrete.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.885
Have you gone mental?

14:30.040 --> 14:31.371
No, no.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.409
Have you been reading the papers?

14:34.400 --> 14:37.882
There is a shitstorm coming, and it's
this country that's gonna be rooted.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.371
It's the working man who's gonna pay.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.410
And knocking two blokes
is gonna help out how exactly?

14:42.560 --> 14:44.005
Ł100 each!

14:44.160 --> 14:47.289
That's a motorbike, Wal!
That is an Indian Scout!

14:47.440 --> 14:48.771
What?
That's a bike!

14:48.920 --> 14:50.684
Yeah!
That's a couple of acres.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.365
You could knock up a house.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.084
You... you are an idiot.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.730
Jesus!

14:59.040 --> 15:01.771
Whiskey. Best you got.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.640
What are we doing?
Cops took our guns.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.371
What are we gonna do,
hack 'em to death with beer coasters?

16:09.520 --> 16:11.045
I'm the gunman.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.484
I'm the gunman.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.568
Down the tunnels,
you could hear the Hun coming.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.722
Tap-tap, tap-tap.

16:25.880 --> 16:29.487
And if you moved a muscle,
they'd blow your bloody brains out.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.562
Ah, here he is!

16:32.720 --> 16:34.370
The Little Gunman himself.

16:44.520 --> 16:45.851
What's the ruckus?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.889
Tomlinson and Dalton are
at the pub round the corner.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.371
Good for them.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.204
This is our chance, Jim.
We hit 'em now.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.044
Why didn't you, then?
No gun!

17:00.600 --> 17:03.206
How many bullets you got?
Seven in the chamber.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.249
We might need 'em.
Archer's there. Tom Kelly too.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.641
I don't know which way he'll go
if it comes to it.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.371
Whoa, whoa, and leave me with
nothing? I'm the one they're after.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.089
I'm the one who shot Gaffney.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.608
OK. The 6 o'clock close -
we get 'em coming out.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.569
Sitting ducks. Yeah?

17:20.560 --> 17:21.560
Yeah, alright.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.409
Alright. Hold this.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.449
Back in a jiffy, boys.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.965
Yeah, give me that.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.451
You sure you're alright?

17:39.600 --> 17:41.523
Don't worry about me, mate.
I've been on ops before.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.843
Gaffney?
Belgium. Winter of 1916.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.923
Only wish you were with me then.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.770
Time, please!

18:14.720 --> 18:16.085
Time to leave these mugs.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.242
They've called close.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.846
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.321
So, what's the plan?

18:23.480 --> 18:25.289
I take one, you take the other?

18:25.440 --> 18:27.090
Mate, we've only got one gun.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.004
Right.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.491
Right, that's OK.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.449
Here, give it to me. I'll do it.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.204
I'll do it.
I'm fine.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.567
Yeah? Alright.

18:36.720 --> 18:39.291
Quick, they're coming out. Go, go!

18:43.640 --> 18:45.130
Hey!

18:48.800 --> 18:51.087
Jim... mate.

18:51.240 --> 18:52.651
Jim, do it!

18:52.800 --> 18:54.404
Hurry up!

18:54.560 --> 18:56.050
Do it!
Mate...

18:56.200 --> 18:58.043
Jesus. Jim!

18:58.200 --> 19:00.123
Frank...
Cop this, you bastards.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.888
Cop this too.

19:10.160 --> 19:12.686
Jim! Jim?

19:15.840 --> 19:17.171
Get back!

19:19.080 --> 19:21.367
Jesus! Wal, buddy!

19:21.520 --> 19:23.488
Wal, can you hear me?

19:23.640 --> 19:25.642
Bring my car round!

19:45.680 --> 19:46.841
Wally!

19:47.000 --> 19:49.844
Barney! Barney, can you hear me?

19:55.600 --> 19:58.001
I need to speak to someone.
I wanna know what happened.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.844
Well, you can't speak to this one.
He's dead.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.651
And if you don't get out of my way,
this one'll be following him!

20:02.800 --> 20:05.849
If I can't find out who did this,
we're gonna have a war on our hands,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.331
and you'll be operating all day.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.847
Now, I'll let you do your job.
Let me do mine.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.480
Mr Tomlinson, who did this?

20:13.480 --> 20:14.811
Who shot you?

20:14.960 --> 20:16.769
Barney!

20:16.920 --> 20:18.843
Who shot you, Wally?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.810
Am I gonna die?
Yes. Yes, you bloody are.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.361
Someone gunned your mate down
in cold blood. Who did it, Wal?

20:24.520 --> 20:26.204
Outside the pub. You had no weapons.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.364
What kind of low mongrel
would do a thing like that, huh?

20:29.520 --> 20:30.851
Who was it, Wal?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.241
Green.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.164
Frank Green!

20:35.320 --> 20:39.041
And Jim Devine!

21:38.520 --> 21:39.851
Kids?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.490
Yeah, probably.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.326
To Wally Tomlinson
and Barney Dalton -

22:04.480 --> 22:06.528
long may they burn in hell, eh?

22:06.680 --> 22:09.331
6 o'clock close -
no-one's done that before.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.050
Oh, they'll be talking about it for years.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.282
Take that, Kate Leigh!

22:17.080 --> 22:19.447
Let me in! it's me!

22:19.600 --> 22:21.329
Who is it?

22:21.480 --> 22:22.811
Frank!

22:22.960 --> 22:24.724
Let me in!

22:28.000 --> 22:28.842
Have the cops been?

22:29.000 --> 22:31.731
No, why would they?
Go on, relax. Have a drink.

22:31.880 --> 22:34.690
Dalton's dead. Word is
Tomlinson's not gonna make it.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.764
I'll... probably be needing
to lay low for a while.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.527
I'll be needing something
to see me through.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.648
Course.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.211
10 quid?

22:55.360 --> 22:57.886
No amount too great for the bloke
who helped my husband

22:58.040 --> 23:01.010
dispose of Kate fucking Leigh's
right-hand men!

23:02.360 --> 23:03.361
Helped?

23:04.400 --> 23:08.530
Frank fired the fatal shot, Till.
You could probably stump up a bit more.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.771
20.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.331
Christ, you'll have me out of business!

23:18.480 --> 23:19.686
Kate Leigh's offering 100.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.365
That stingy bitch would never have paid.

23:21.520 --> 23:22.851
She's all piss and wind.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.843
Good job, son. You got 'em!

23:25.000 --> 23:27.241
Let's forget this bubbly shit
and have a real drink.

23:36.440 --> 23:37.930
Why didn't you shoot them?

23:38.080 --> 23:41.687
You're the gunman.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.444
I was just there to back you up.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.729
It's what mates do. Cheers.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.328
House of fun.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.604
Right.

23:57.880 --> 23:58.927
Right.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.644
Tomlinsons alive.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.326
He named you.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.245
What, Frank?
The both of you.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.241
You got rid of the gun, didn't you, mate?
Yeah, of course.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.971
Haven't seen a gun, have ya?

24:36.120 --> 24:38.122
As it happens...

24:38.280 --> 24:40.521
It was tossed into a yard
300 yards down from the pub.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.011
Bloke thought it was a toy.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.003
Are we sure it's the right one?
Six bullets missing.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.491
Two in Dalton, two in Tomlinson,

24:45.640 --> 24:47.722
one in some bloke's hand
and one in the pub wall.

24:47.880 --> 24:50.451
Besides, the serial number matches
a revolver we logged at the Devines'

24:50.600 --> 24:52.409
in a raid after the Gaffney shooting.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.801
Why wasn't it confiscated then?
Prick had a license for it.

24:54.960 --> 24:58.043
Besides, what kind of idiot uses
a revolver logged as theirs?

24:58.200 --> 25:00.806
These idiots!
Where's Devine and Green now?

25:02.440 --> 25:04.602
By the time we got to Maroubra,
they'd gone into smoke.

25:04.760 --> 25:07.366
We must find them immediately!

25:07.520 --> 25:08.851
Gaffney, now Dalton.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.890
We can't have people gunned down in
the street. The Premier is spitting chips.

25:12.040 --> 25:14.122
They can't hide forever.
Put everyone you've got on them.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.362
Get a watch at Central
and roadblocks on the main roads.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.602
Still got people at Maroubra?
Keep a tail on Tilly Devine.

25:18.760 --> 25:21.161
She might lead us to Big Jim.
One on Green's wife as well.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.243
What about Nellie Cameron?
What about her?

25:23.400 --> 25:25.846
Green's more likely to go
to his moll than his wife.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.924
Then stick a tail on her too.
We must get these pricks!

25:29.080 --> 25:31.162
I don't know where he is.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.243
He went out yesterday.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.731
I haven't seen him since.

25:35.880 --> 25:37.325
You know why we wanna speak to him.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.721
You're always after him for something.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.211
Persecuting him.

25:41.360 --> 25:44.364
A husband... father.

25:44.520 --> 25:45.851
A murderer.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.240
Liar!

25:47.400 --> 25:48.481
Mum?

25:48.640 --> 25:49.971
Get out!

25:51.600 --> 25:55.207
How dare you come to my house,
saying these things!

25:55.360 --> 25:59.001
Your husband shot three men outside
the Tradesman's Arms last night.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.970
One is dead, one is fighting for his life.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.610
Must've had his reasons.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.085
Self-defense.

26:06.240 --> 26:08.925
Your husband works for
Tilly Devine, Mrs Green.

26:09.080 --> 26:13.005
He's a gangster. He sells cocaine,
he peddles prostitutes for Tilly.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.002
No.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.764
He consorts with
one of those prostitutes.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.241
Nellie Cameron.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.290
I'm sure you've heard of her.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.611
It's Nellie he takes to the pictures...

26:25.760 --> 26:28.604
escorts to the clubs...

26:28.760 --> 26:30.728
buys jewellery for.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.730
That fur coat.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.643
Your husband bought that for Nellie.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.167
Ł20.

26:44.240 --> 26:45.571
20...

26:45.720 --> 26:47.051
Ł20.

26:47.200 --> 26:50.204
And he kills people to get that money.

26:52.280 --> 26:56.729
All I know is my husband
provides for me and my children.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.360
So, why are you still working
in the custard factory?

26:59.520 --> 27:02.763
Why don't you ask Nellie Cameron?

27:02.920 --> 27:06.641
If she knows so much about him...

27:07.840 --> 27:09.763
why don't you ask that whore?

27:18.200 --> 27:19.929
Green's not at Nellie's place.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.650
Maybe she's going to him now.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.125
She's going back home.

27:43.280 --> 27:45.044
So much for that.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.930
Wait here a moment.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.841
Excuse me...
Madam...

27:55.840 --> 27:57.808
The lady who was just in here,
the pretty one.

27:57.960 --> 28:00.122
All my customers are pretty!
Nellie Cameron.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.851
Nellie...
She's in here twice a week.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.685
Do I have to take you down to the station
to jog your memory?

28:05.840 --> 28:07.842
Oh, Nellie! Yeah, yeah. What about her?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.331
What'd she buy?

28:09.480 --> 28:11.289
Same as every Friday - T-bone.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.771
Twice as much, though.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.491
Little thing like that.
It's enough to feed her for a week!

28:15.640 --> 28:17.483
Don't know where she puts it!

28:17.640 --> 28:20.041
She's taking the steak to Frank,
I'm sure of it.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.168
Huh?
The steak - she's taking it to Frank.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.970
There.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.371
Railway station.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.010
We're gonna need back-up.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.531
Good tucker, Nell.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.001
Not much of a cook.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.010
You don't have to be.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.767
You are
a wanted man, Frankie!

28:57.920 --> 29:00.048
A man on the run!
Just you and me, babe.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.089
Just you and me.

29:06.360 --> 29:09.204
Who is it?

29:09.360 --> 29:11.806
Police! Open the door, Frank,
or we'll force it.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.450
Nellie Cameron,
we know you're in there.

29:13.600 --> 29:14.931
Alright, alright.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.923
We've no guns.
Open up!

29:17.080 --> 29:18.969
Alright, I'm opening the door.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.763
There's no need to...

29:26.680 --> 29:28.284
How was the T-bone, Frank?

29:31.720 --> 29:33.484
Pretty bloody nice.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.164
Frankie. Frankie!

29:45.920 --> 29:47.445
Never been to Melbourne before.

29:47.600 --> 29:51.969
We should take a show in.
There's a band touring from Cuba. Jazz.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.724
Why not?

29:53.880 --> 29:57.851
This might work out quite well -
a little break from Sydney.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.764
Break from the wife.

29:59.920 --> 30:01.524
âTilly Devine, a clam so fine.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.728
âBut I'd rather run a mile
than make her mine. â

30:03.880 --> 30:05.450
Ah!

30:05.600 --> 30:07.602
Jesus, Jim!

30:07.760 --> 30:09.569
It was just a joke!

30:09.720 --> 30:11.085
That's my wife
you're mouthing off about.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.527
Watch your bloody tongue.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.449
Christ!

30:30.680 --> 30:32.364
Big Jim Devine.

30:32.520 --> 30:33.851
Are you looking for someone?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.411
You, as a matter of fact.

30:35.560 --> 30:37.289
Me?
Out.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.325
Frank Green's been arrested
and charged with murder.

30:41.480 --> 30:42.970
Now it's your turn.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.690
Christ, that's stiff, Wickham.

30:44.840 --> 30:47.366
You want stiff?
You talk to Barney Dalton.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.531
I'm so sorry.

31:10.680 --> 31:13.570
Barney was a fine young man.
He was a credit to you.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.402
He'd still be alive if he stuck to footy.

31:27.160 --> 31:28.491
This business.

31:28.640 --> 31:31.325
It took his leg, now his life.

31:31.480 --> 31:34.643
Are you saying it's my fault?

31:34.800 --> 31:37.041
That I killed him?

31:37.200 --> 31:40.443
I'm just saying, is all.

31:54.960 --> 31:58.965
I was about 20 stone
and only 7 feet tall

32:00.600 --> 32:01.931
Eileen?

32:12.280 --> 32:13.691
What's going on in there?

32:13.840 --> 32:16.446
Just a minute.
Open up!

32:16.600 --> 32:20.002
Just a minute.
I said open up!

32:20.160 --> 32:23.323
Well, Eddie, enough smoko.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.642
Come on, let's get
this wood in. Good lad.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.406
You leave it, Eddie. You go inside,
alright, and you wait for me.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.050
There's a boy.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.489
What the hell do you think you're doing?

32:33.640 --> 32:35.085
Mum?
Nothing.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.810
Albert?

32:36.960 --> 32:40.282
Go inside, Eileen. Albert and I
are discussing something.

32:40.440 --> 32:43.683
You wanna talk to Albert,
you talk to me too.

32:45.240 --> 32:46.571
Fine.

32:46.720 --> 32:49.121
Actually, Eileen, love, it's fine.
We're just having a quick chat.

32:49.280 --> 32:52.011
Be right up. Promise.

32:56.840 --> 32:59.161
Start packing.
What?

32:59.320 --> 33:01.448
You're not gonna sleep another night
with my daughter.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.927
I make your daughter happy.

33:06.560 --> 33:10.645
When was the last time you said
anything nice to your daughter?

33:10.800 --> 33:14.725
Every time you open your mouth,
it's "Too fat, too slow, too... â

33:14.880 --> 33:17.201
I'm good for your daughter.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.681
I love her and she loves me.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.161
And what else do you 'love'?

33:22.320 --> 33:23.970
This has got nothing to do with Eileen.

33:24.120 --> 33:26.805
You're not staying
another night in this house.

33:29.880 --> 33:31.370
We're married.

33:31.520 --> 33:33.682
You can't make me leave.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.649
No, I can't.

33:35.800 --> 33:39.850
But every day you stay,
you better check every pocket,

33:40.000 --> 33:43.083
you better check every room,
every bag that you carry.

33:44.200 --> 33:45.770
Cocaine possession.

33:45.920 --> 33:49.925
Cops End cocaine on you,
it's straight to Long Bay.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.445
Yeah?

33:51.600 --> 33:54.809
So... it's the ship or the Bay.

33:54.960 --> 33:58.567
It's your choice, you sick bastard.

34:03.720 --> 34:07.042
Excellent! Frank Green and Jim Devine.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.168
Well done, gentlemen.

34:09.320 --> 34:10.889
Got 'em this time, eh?

34:12.960 --> 34:14.085
What?

34:14.239 --> 34:17.402
We may have a small problem
with the witnesses.

34:17.560 --> 34:20.291
There were half a dozen interviewed
on the night, straight after the shooting.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.283
Publican heard the shots.

34:22.440 --> 34:24.522
Now says he thinks
it was a car backfiring.

34:25.800 --> 34:28.326
Connors. Charles Connors.

34:28.480 --> 34:31.165
Says he was in the urinal
at the time of the shooting.

34:33.480 --> 34:34.925
William Archer?

34:35.080 --> 34:36.809
Don't tell me.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.291
He was in a urinal too.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.603
Admits he was with Tom Kelly,
but left before the shooting occurred

34:41.760 --> 34:43.091
and didn't hear about it till later.

34:43.239 --> 34:44.924
What about the bloke
got shot in the hand?

34:45.080 --> 34:47.924
He was right in the middle of it.
He must've seen who shot him.

34:48.080 --> 34:51.322
Edward Brady. Says he was
too drunk to remember anything.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.091
So what've we got?

34:58.240 --> 35:00.129
Wally Tomlinson's dying deposition.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.009
A man in pain, on death's door,

35:02.160 --> 35:04.640
names another, known to be his enemy,
as his shooter.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.088
Can't wait to see what Devine
and Green's defense does with that.

35:09.840 --> 35:12.446
Where's Tomlinson now?
He's in the hospital.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.090
Alright, we'll get a coroner down there.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.129
Put Frank Green and Jim Devine
in front of Tomlinson

35:16.280 --> 35:18.203
and get another deposition, right?

35:18.360 --> 35:19.850
On paper, witnessed.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.490
Go!

35:22.960 --> 35:24.405
Woman asking for you.

35:24.560 --> 35:26.289
Kate Leigh.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.850
Kate.

35:36.560 --> 35:39.131
Just go and sit over there, alright?
Good boy.

35:41.280 --> 35:42.884
I need a favour.

35:44.480 --> 35:45.481
Kid.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.084
I need you to find
a place for him.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.571
Who is he?

35:50.720 --> 35:52.051
That doesn't matter.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.282
But he ain't safe on the street.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.602
There's hundreds of kids on the street.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.888
This one's different.

36:01.280 --> 36:02.770
Kate!

36:04.400 --> 36:05.731
What happened to him?

36:05.880 --> 36:09.362
All you need to know is I've taken care of
the bloke who fiddled with him.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.207
You take care of the boy.

36:28.080 --> 36:29.570
Wally.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.487
They wouldn't let me in before.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.530
How you feeling?

36:42.680 --> 36:45.047
We gave Barney a good send-off.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.970
I'm so sorry.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.724
it's just a scratch.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.848
Nah, it's more than that.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.089
Bringing the suspects in now.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.730
You have to leave.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.611
Suspects? For what?

37:05.760 --> 37:06.841
Special coronial hearing

37:07.000 --> 37:08.923
so your mate here
can officially identify his attackers.

37:09.080 --> 37:10.570
Name them again?

37:10.720 --> 37:12.609
So we can lock 'em up
once and for all.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.762
So they can come
and finish him off, you mean.

37:18.280 --> 37:21.011
You go easy on him.
He nearly died, he did.

37:21.160 --> 37:24.004
Probably doesn't remember
what he said on the night.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.568
Now, you look after yourself, Wal.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.602
You do what's right for you.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.246
Mrs Leigh...

37:44.440 --> 37:45.930
Don't...

37:54.920 --> 37:56.410
Alright, bring them in.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.250
Do you recognise this man?

38:07.120 --> 38:09.088
I know him as Jim Devine.

38:09.240 --> 38:11.766
Did you see him outside
the Tradesman's Arms

38:11.920 --> 38:16.164
on the night that you were shot
and Barney Dalton was killed?

38:20.920 --> 38:23.127
You'll need to speak up for the record.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.491
No, he wasn't there.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.085
You told me that you saw...

38:32.240 --> 38:33.401
Officer!

38:37.720 --> 38:39.609
Do you recognise this man?

38:39.760 --> 38:41.285
Yes.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.805
Frank Green.

38:42.960 --> 38:45.406
Did you see him outside
the Tradesman's Arms

38:45.560 --> 38:48.689
on the night that you were shot
and Barney Dalton was killed?

38:59.080 --> 39:00.081
Yeah.

39:01.600 --> 39:04.604
He shot Barney and he shot me.

39:04.760 --> 39:08.207
You piece of shit, Tomlinson!
You're a filthy beast!

39:08.360 --> 39:11.091
You're a dog! You filthy coward!

39:11.240 --> 39:13.641
You're a dog, Tomlinson! You hear me?

39:13.800 --> 39:15.165
A dog!

39:15.320 --> 39:17.209
You're a dog, Tomlinson!

39:17.360 --> 39:18.691
A dog!

39:18.840 --> 39:20.126
He talked?

39:21.360 --> 39:23.044
Wally Tomlinson had broken

39:23.200 --> 39:25.089
the cardinal rule of the underworld.

39:25.240 --> 39:29.006
He'd broken the code of silence.
He'd named names.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.083
You're young to be arrested.

39:44.240 --> 39:47.130
Young enough to do the crime,
young enough to do the time.

39:47.280 --> 39:48.691
What crime's that?

39:48.840 --> 39:50.842
I don't know.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.968
You wanna see something?

39:58.440 --> 40:00.169
You find it, you can have it.

40:00.320 --> 40:02.209
That's easy.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.690
Where'd it go?

40:08.480 --> 40:11.051
You can have it anyway.

40:23.480 --> 40:25.369
I won't be showing you
how to pick a lock!

40:25.520 --> 40:28.444
Good news, Eddie.
I've got a place for you.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.682
It's an orphanage.

40:30.840 --> 40:33.081
They've managed to squeeze you in.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.322
You'll go to school,
have friends your own age.

40:35.480 --> 40:37.130
It's better than people say.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.123
Can I still visit Mrs Leigh?

40:41.600 --> 40:43.329
Probably best you don't, son.

40:43.480 --> 40:44.970
Come on. We can go now.

40:46.240 --> 40:47.969
Oh! Your bag.

40:50.960 --> 40:53.884
Bright kid.
After what he's been through!

40:54.040 --> 40:56.771
He'll be right.
Probably end up prime minister.

40:59.880 --> 41:02.360
Albert's gone. His clothes are gone.

41:04.440 --> 41:05.771
What have you done?

41:05.920 --> 41:08.890
He wasn't right for you, Eileen.

41:12.960 --> 41:14.450
Was there ever a house?

41:18.560 --> 41:20.050
Where is he?

41:22.160 --> 41:24.003
Where is he?

41:25.040 --> 41:26.371
Albert!

41:26.520 --> 41:27.521
Albert!

41:31.000 --> 41:32.729
Thank God I found you!
Eileen...

41:32.880 --> 41:34.530
Don't go!

41:34.680 --> 41:36.967
Whatever she said, it doesn't matter.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.684
We can go anywhere.

41:42.360 --> 41:44.044
What about the baby?

41:46.240 --> 41:48.208
You're better off without me.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.410
I'll come with you.

41:51.560 --> 41:54.131
It's not your mother. it's...

41:55.960 --> 41:57.450
it's me.

42:00.800 --> 42:02.689
You know the awful thing?

42:08.120 --> 42:09.724
I do like you.

42:29.040 --> 42:30.963
I don't even know what that means.

42:32.040 --> 42:34.202
Albert, what does that...

42:34.360 --> 42:37.330
Albert, what does that mean? Albert!

42:52.840 --> 42:54.410
Hello, doggie.

42:58.840 --> 43:01.525
What are you doing?
Leaving.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.049
You're not leaving with him, are you?

43:05.200 --> 43:07.168
No, his boat sailed.

43:08.200 --> 43:09.690
I'm leaving you, Ma.

43:14.240 --> 43:15.730
By the way...

43:17.280 --> 43:18.770
I'm pregnant.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.290
Wait!

43:27.480 --> 43:30.529
I can take care of you.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.489
Both of you.

43:33.480 --> 43:35.881
You'll have everything you need.

43:38.880 --> 43:40.564
I don't want anything from you.

43:41.560 --> 43:43.483
Ever again.
