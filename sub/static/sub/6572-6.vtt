00:02.068 --> 00:05.003
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.105 --> 00:07.505
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.185 --> 00:23.121
<i>Michael was sharing
some very important news with his parents.</i>

00:23.223 --> 00:25.453
I am getting married.

00:25.558 --> 00:27.958
Who the hell to?

00:28.061 --> 00:30.052
Who do you think? Rita.

00:30.163 --> 00:32.756
- Her?
- Why?

00:32.866 --> 00:34.959
First, she needs a green card
to stay in the country.

00:35.068 --> 00:37.366
- There it is.
- She needs a green card to stay in the country...

00:37.470 --> 00:40.735
because, secondly,
we're really crazy about each other.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.638
- You hardly know her.
- I know all the important stuff.

00:43.743 --> 00:45.240
She was in the Olympics.

00:45.645 --> 00:50.207
- She's sweet, smart, beautiful. She's special.
<i>- She was special.</i>

00:50.316 --> 00:53.979
- Are houses hard to make?
- Actually, the hardest part is finding the land.

00:54.087 --> 00:56.351
<i>But she wasn't smart.</i>

00:56.456 --> 01:00.324
Instead of making houses,
maybe you should make land...

01:00.427 --> 01:02.952
<i>- For Rita had only mentally progressed...</i>
- on the ocean.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.962
<i>To the level of a first-grader.</i>

01:05.065 --> 01:07.397
There's no land on the ocean.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.060
<i>Michael might have noticed
her disability...</i>

01:10.170 --> 01:12.900
<i>if it had not been masked
by her English accent.</i>

01:13.006 --> 01:16.442
- You're brilliant.
<i>- Yeah, she wasn't.</i>

01:16.543 --> 01:20.172
She's a really good person. Everything else
is gonna be little surprises along the way.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.305
<i>With the exception of that one big one.</i>

01:22.415 --> 01:26.818
- The wedding is in one month.
- Oh.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.820
- A month!
- Now, look.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.085
Just because a woman gets pregnant,
it doesn't mean you have to marry her.

01:32.192 --> 01:34.922
Too many lives have been ruined
because some cheap waitress at a HoJo...

01:35.028 --> 01:37.019
said she used an IUD.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.621
- It was Stuckey's.
- But I believed you.

01:39.732 --> 01:42.963
She's not pregnant.
We haven't even slept together.

01:43.069 --> 01:44.764
This is funny.

01:44.871 --> 01:48.102
- He's gay!
- Where's your hand?

01:48.208 --> 01:52.008
I'm having my high school ring put on it,
and my hook is stuck in the stair car.

01:56.049 --> 01:58.381
Oh.

01:58.485 --> 02:02.615
- Do you think getting married
will solve your sex problem?
- No, we don't have a problem.

02:02.722 --> 02:06.556
- We just haven't had the right opportunity yet.
- Lindsay said Rita slept over.

02:06.659 --> 02:09.685
Yes, but I gave her the bedroom
because I didn't want her to feel pressured.

02:09.795 --> 02:12.959
<i>Actually, it was Michael
who felt a little pressured.</i>

02:13.066 --> 02:14.966
I like to keep the light on.

02:15.068 --> 02:19.004
That way, I can see
if you have a monster.

02:19.105 --> 02:21.665
Night-night. Can you shut the door
on your way out?

02:21.774 --> 02:23.674
I can't believe
you're not supporting this.

02:23.776 --> 02:25.903
Because it is obvious
what she's after.

02:26.012 --> 02:28.640
- Our money.
- Oh, God! Our money.

02:28.748 --> 02:33.583
- Let's all remind ourselves
we don't have any money.
- She's already gotten our money!

02:33.686 --> 02:37.554
Let's not forget she's the one that gave us
the idea for that ocean-top town called Bluthton.

02:39.859 --> 02:42.521
Big deal. I had that same
basic idea years ago.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.731
I thought you'd be happy.
I should've known better.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.599
Michael, be careful.
People just see what they want to see.

02:50.703 --> 02:53.069
If she loved you, she'd show it.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.141
<i>Michael was worried.</i>

02:55.241 --> 02:57.505
<i>His mother may have
been making sense.</i>

02:57.610 --> 02:59.976
<i>So he returned home
to talk to Rita.</i>

03:00.079 --> 03:03.276
- Here comes the bride!
- What are you doing in a wheelchair?

03:03.383 --> 03:06.045
No, no. It's a dolly...
to help videotape your nuptials.

03:06.652 --> 03:09.781
I don't think I need any footage of my nuptials.

03:09.889 --> 03:13.689
Tobias, are you sure that this dolly isn't
related to your recent health problems?

03:13.793 --> 03:17.229
Okay, so my legs and my left arm
occasionally "go to sleep."

03:17.330 --> 03:19.525
And you want to call it
a health problem.

03:19.632 --> 03:21.862
- Oop.
- Hey. Hey, hey!

03:21.968 --> 03:23.698
I can get up myself.

03:24.804 --> 03:26.931
- Here we go.
- Let me get in the dolly.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.871
No, thank you.
I don't need your help.

03:28.975 --> 03:32.138
It does seem like you've been having
a lot of trouble since the hair transplants.

03:32.245 --> 03:36.204
- Maybe you should see a "bubaman."
- A bubaman?

03:36.316 --> 03:38.580
Oh, uh, doctor.
It's a British expression.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.778
Like they say "go up box"
instead of â€œelevator."

03:40.887 --> 03:43.287
Like when they say "poofter"
to mean "tourist."

03:43.389 --> 03:46.381
- Boy, that Rita's a smarty.
- True, but it's not like anybody appreciates it.

03:46.492 --> 03:49.222
- Mom and Dad do not like Rita.
- Are they crazy? She's amazing.

03:49.329 --> 03:52.059
I saw her last night. She helped me
with this project I was doing.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.565
<i>Maeby was struggling with a screenplay...</i>

03:54.667 --> 03:56.828
<i>in her secret life as a film executive.</i>

03:56.936 --> 03:59.769
- Is that a story?
- Not yet. It doesn't have an ending.

03:59.872 --> 04:03.103
He's in LA. She's in Japan. How do I get
these two characters together?

04:03.209 --> 04:06.269
- Maybe they could walk.
- Across the ocean?

04:06.379 --> 04:09.280
- If it's not too deep.
- No. Deep is good.

04:09.382 --> 04:12.249
People are gonna say, " What the hell
just happened? I'd better say I like it."

04:12.352 --> 04:14.912
- 'Cause nobody wants to seem stupid.
- I like it.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.750
<i>The Ocean Walker.</i> Holy crap.
That's gonna look good on a hat.

04:17.857 --> 04:20.485
<i>And Michael caught up with his brother.</i>

04:20.593 --> 04:23.084
I need a favor. As you know,
I'm gettin' married in a month.

04:23.196 --> 04:26.597
- Say no more.
- Great. Are you sure that you know what...

04:26.699 --> 04:30.465
- Yep, yep, yep. Got it.
- Super. Just so that we're both clear...

04:30.570 --> 04:33.437
You want me to do a magic show
at the wedding. I'm on it.

04:33.539 --> 04:36.508
I'm so glad we pushed
through that. No magic.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.510
Why, because of the one
little screw-up last time?

04:39.612 --> 04:42.308
<i>- Put her out! Put her out!</i>
<i>- Tracey! On fire! Roll!</i>

04:42.415 --> 04:44.315
<i>Thank God we already did the pictures.</i>

04:44.417 --> 04:48.012
Which reminds me that Rita shouldn't
wear any hair spray at this thing.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.851
- I just want you to be my witness.
- You want me to...

04:52.558 --> 04:54.287
be your best man?

04:54.394 --> 04:57.022
It's just a signature
I need on the license.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.462
My son's not old enough.
It's... It's no big deal.

04:59.565 --> 05:01.999
I will not take
this sacred duty lightly.

05:02.101 --> 05:07.505
I am gonna get you the single healthiest
call girl that this town has ever seen.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.700
This is why I'm calling it a witness
and not a best man.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.902
All you gotta do is watch.

05:12.011 --> 05:14.411
I'm not gonna spend
this kind of money and not watch.

05:14.914 --> 05:16.744
This may have been a bad choice.

05:18.418 --> 05:21.251
Hey, hello. Look at you two...
Tweedledee, Tweedledum.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.345
<i>Michael didn't mean it in that way.</i>

05:23.456 --> 05:25.981
<i>How could he?
He didn't even know.</i>

05:26.092 --> 05:29.152
We had the best time.
She's got such an amazing fashion sense.

05:29.262 --> 05:32.163
- You guys got these jackets on inside-out?
- That way, you see the label.

05:32.265 --> 05:35.894
That's what you're paying for, right?
It's a great statement on fashion.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.563
- Plus it doesn't tickle your neck.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.971
<i>Michael took Lindsay aside
to share his concerns.</i>

05:43.076 --> 05:46.170
Lindsay, when did you first realize
that you and Tobias...

05:46.279 --> 05:48.179
had no chance
at a physical relationship?

05:48.281 --> 05:51.512
Oh, my God. Do you think we have no chance
at a physical relationship?

05:51.617 --> 05:55.917
So, just now. See, Rita and I
have not been physical yet, and...

05:56.022 --> 05:58.513
You don't think she's doing this
just for a green card, do you?

05:58.624 --> 06:02.560
No. She's not that kind of person.
You just haven't been alone with her.

06:02.662 --> 06:05.460
Ask her to stay over
at a hotel with you tonight.

06:05.565 --> 06:08.193
- She's gonna know what that means.
- That is not a bad idea.

06:08.301 --> 06:11.099
Don't... Don't do that.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.469
<i>And Gob began to prepare
a magic trick for Michael's wedding.</i>

06:14.574 --> 06:17.543
Takes his queen...

06:17.643 --> 06:20.168
and showers her with diamonds!

06:20.279 --> 06:22.839
Clubs. Club sauce.

06:22.949 --> 06:25.383
He covers her with club sauce.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.385
That'll be my line
if that happens.

06:27.487 --> 06:30.081
Is that a magic trick?
I love magic.

06:30.189 --> 06:32.817
I don't appreciate
the dry British humor.

06:34.894 --> 06:38.227
Please do a magic trick for me.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.357
Well, I shouldn't.
I'd hate to be blamed...

06:41.467 --> 06:44.994
for setting another one
of Michael's brides... on fire!

06:46.439 --> 06:48.407
Oh. Lighter fluid,
like Uncle Trevor uses.

06:48.508 --> 06:51.068
But wherever did it come from?

06:51.177 --> 06:54.305
Okay, I've gotta get you
into an illusion at the wedding.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.508
- How long can you hold your breath?
- Oh, long. One time, 20 minutes.

06:58.617 --> 07:00.950
<i>Actually, her record was 20 seconds.</i>

07:01.053 --> 07:03.851
You can stop it. It's okay.
I'm gonna take your word for it.

07:03.956 --> 07:07.187
Now I just need to find a trick that
puts you out of oxygen for 20 minutes.

07:07.293 --> 07:10.888
Sorry? Did I hear the word "trick"?
And it smells a lot like lighter fluid in here.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.988
I did say no tricks, Gob,
and I mean it.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.432
What if I find a trick that has her
float to the altar or something?

07:16.536 --> 07:18.504
No, no. Love for her to walk
and not to drown...

07:18.604 --> 07:21.129
or fly through the air
or catch on fire.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.970
- Is she allergic to cat fur?
- Uh, no tigers.

07:24.076 --> 07:25.976
Great.

07:26.078 --> 07:28.410
So, uh, Rita, um...

07:28.514 --> 07:31.176
I was wondering
if maybe you and I...

07:31.284 --> 07:33.718
might head down to a hotel?

07:33.820 --> 07:37.051
- Maybe some alone time.
- Oh, yes.

07:37.156 --> 07:39.784
- Yeah?
- Maybe our rooms could touch.

07:41.392 --> 07:44.693
I... I was hoping maybe for more
than just our rooms to touch.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.322
I was thinking maybe
we could be...

07:47.433 --> 07:51.494
in the same room,
be in the same bed.

07:51.604 --> 07:55.301
I see what you mean...
a real sleepover.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.239
- Well, maybe.
- Okay.

07:57.343 --> 07:59.834
- Really?
- Maybe I should go home and get my things.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.846
I do kinda miss my jammies.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.973
I think they're gonna have
a lot of that stuff there.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.210
And my tiny teddy.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.811
Good. Yes, get that.

08:09.922 --> 08:12.823
<i>And so George Michael
drove Rita to Wee Britain.</i>

08:12.925 --> 08:15.519
It's nice to be
with someone young.

08:15.628 --> 08:18.324
We can listen to young people's music
for a change.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.399
Great. Yeah, please.

08:27.607 --> 08:30.373
<i>That's when he first grew concerned.</i>

08:31.477 --> 08:34.605
<i>And Rita packed for her sleepover.</i>

08:34.714 --> 08:38.047
Do you have any idea what a sleepover is?
'Cause it's not just sleep.

08:38.150 --> 08:41.517
I know what it is, Trevor.
I've seen your secret magazine.

08:44.290 --> 08:48.021
I want to have grown-up fun...
spoon and figgy pudding...

08:48.127 --> 08:50.527
rabbit down dum,
druggeries hollow.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.530
And I want to have pop-pop.

08:52.632 --> 08:55.260
The very fact that you call it that
tells me you're not ready.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.895
And for your information,
that's a cricket magazine.

09:01.807 --> 09:04.207
Whether you like it or not,
you're still a child in many ways.

09:04.310 --> 09:07.438
I got a problem with you having
sexual relations with that man.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.311
<i>- So do I.</i>
- It's not your fault your parents were cousins.

09:10.416 --> 09:15.115
But here we are, and I've been charged with
taking care of you, and I'm bloody well gonna do it.

09:15.221 --> 09:19.658
Well, Michael will be my cousin soon enough,
'cause we're getting married.

09:19.759 --> 09:21.317
- Married?
- Married!

09:21.427 --> 09:24.555
- Totally out of the question!
- Married, married, married!

09:24.664 --> 09:26.859
All right, that does it.
You're not going anywhere.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.764
- I'm puttin' the invisible locks on the door.
- That's not fair.

09:29.869 --> 09:31.928
- Lock, lock.
- It's not fair!

09:32.038 --> 09:34.006
- It's just not fair!
- Lock, lock.

09:35.875 --> 09:38.275
I gotta find a new hiding place
for that magazine.

09:38.377 --> 09:40.845
<i>And Michael was waiting at the hotel.</i>

09:40.947 --> 09:43.211
Hey, Dad. Just wanted
to let you know...

09:43.316 --> 09:46.046
that I'm at a hotel
with my wife-to-be.

09:46.152 --> 09:50.248
- And we're very, very much in love.
- Put her on.

09:50.356 --> 09:54.315
<i>- Michael briefly considered faking the voice.</i>
- I...

09:54.427 --> 09:56.361
- She's in the shower.
- I'll wait.

09:56.462 --> 09:58.430
Let's wait.

10:02.368 --> 10:04.268
Don't you want me
to just call you back or...

10:04.370 --> 10:06.964
No. I got nowhere to go.
I'm under house arrest.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.098
Let's watch something together.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.435
Wow. That Blossom grew up, huh?

10:13.546 --> 10:15.514
<i>Say, how's that shower comin'?</i>

10:15.615 --> 10:17.776
- All right, look, she's not in the shower.
- Really?

10:17.883 --> 10:19.783
She said that she'd
meet me at the hotel.

10:19.885 --> 10:23.377
- I called you a little prematurely,
but she is coming. - Really?

10:27.993 --> 10:30.986
Uh! Hey, put Rita on.

10:31.097 --> 10:33.122
<i>That's when Michael finally accepted...</i>

10:33.232 --> 10:36.167
<i>that Rita wasn't coming...</i>

10:36.268 --> 10:39.362
<i>and that local calls
were 2.95 a minute.</i>

10:39.472 --> 10:42.771
- Come on!
<i>- That's where they get you.</i>

10:47.013 --> 10:50.540
<i>Michael drove to Wee Britain
to call off the wedding...</i>

10:50.650 --> 10:53.346
<i>that he now realized was not based on love.</i>

10:53.452 --> 10:56.250
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- It's Michael, Rita. Can I come in?

10:56.355 --> 10:59.324
<i>- I can't let you in.</i>
- You didn't show up last night.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.893
The least you can do
is talk to me face-to-face.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.258
<i>I can't.
Trevor locked the door.</i>

11:04.363 --> 11:06.797
<i>He doesn't want me to be with you.</i>

11:06.899 --> 11:09.163
What? He locked the door?
You can't unlock this door?

11:09.268 --> 11:12.499
<i>- I can't even see half the locks.</i>
- Rita? What?

11:12.605 --> 11:15.768
<i>They're invisible.
Trevor's the only one who can see them.</i>

11:15.875 --> 11:18.844
I've got an idea. Go next to the window.
I'm gonna climb up.

11:19.879 --> 11:23.542
- Be careful.
- I will.

11:26.752 --> 11:29.744
<i>And so Michael set about
rescuing the beautiful...</i>

11:29.855 --> 11:33.222
<i>sweet, mentally challenged
woman he'd fallen in love with...</i>

11:33.325 --> 11:36.817
<i>without realizing
she was mentally challenged.</i>

11:36.929 --> 11:39.329
- Yea, Michael! Yea!
<i>- Who undid the locks?</i>

11:39.432 --> 11:41.366
- Come on out.
- Trevor's back.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.992
- Come on. Hop on.
- What?

11:44.103 --> 11:45.832
- Hop on.
- Huh?

11:45.938 --> 11:50.068
- Ready?
- Oh! Oh!

11:50.176 --> 11:52.144
Whee! Oh!

11:52.244 --> 11:55.111
Hey! Stop that!
The both of ya come back!

11:55.214 --> 11:58.240
- You can't stop us.
- Nothing can stop us now.

11:58.350 --> 12:03.186
Nothing in the world of man nor
beast nor time can... 

12:05.990 --> 12:07.453
!@%$ all!

12:07.560 --> 12:11.587
<i>Reunited with Rita, Michael told
his parents he'd be getting married tomorrow.</i>

12:11.697 --> 12:15.360
- We're getting married tomorrow.
- God help her if she tries to rename Bluthton.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.096
I'll sink it first. I swear,
I'll sink the whole damn thing.

12:18.704 --> 12:20.866
They're goin' through with it... tomorrow.

12:21.473 --> 12:24.841
<i>But George and Lucille
had a surprise visitor.</i>

12:24.944 --> 12:26.969
All right!
Where the hell is Rita?

12:27.079 --> 12:29.513
- I'm her uncle.
- Let the handouts begin.

12:29.615 --> 12:32.812
There's not gonna be any handouts,
and she is not gonna marry your son.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.443
- You're against this marriage too.
- Well, of course I am.

12:35.554 --> 12:38.284
Rita's not capable of makin'
a decision like that.

12:38.390 --> 12:41.655
You are not gonna get Rita's millions
just because she's mentally challenged.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.059
- Millions?
- Millions?

12:44.163 --> 12:47.326
- Mentally challenged?
- Shh! It's not polite.

12:47.433 --> 12:51.233
She owns all of Wee Britain
and also the Wee Britain in Cleveland.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.362
'Course, we're probably
gonna lose all that...

12:53.472 --> 12:56.168
if her ridiculous idea
for Sea Britain goes through.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.744
We are not after her money.

12:59.845 --> 13:04.475
And I don't think Michael
even knows about her... condition.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.483
It's funny how Americans
don't pick up on that.

13:06.585 --> 13:10.316
I think it's 'cause of her accent and
the plastic surgery she's been able to afford.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.982
We wouldn't have this trouble
if they'd met last year.

13:14.760 --> 13:18.355
I gotta put a stop to this. I'm gonna
search every bloody hotel in town.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.864
Oh! Legoland.
I think they said...

13:20.966 --> 13:22.934
- they were going to Legoland.
- They did say Legoland.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.900
I didn't hear anything
about Legoland.

13:25.004 --> 13:27.734
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.400
We think he may be mentally challenged.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.534
- Huh?
- All right then.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.944
We have got 24 hours to get them married...

13:36.048 --> 13:39.176
before Michael figures out
what she really is.

13:39.285 --> 13:44.382
This is the first time in two years
you sound like George Bluth.

13:46.492 --> 13:51.122
<i>Later that night, Michael
was at the hotel with his bride-to-be.</i>

13:51.230 --> 13:54.631
- Rita, I've been really looking forward to this.
- Me too.

13:54.733 --> 13:59.033
I want to have sexual relations.

13:59.138 --> 14:02.198
The mere fact that you call it that
tells me that you are ready.

14:02.308 --> 14:04.674
- That's why I brought this.
<i>- Oh!</i>

14:04.777 --> 14:07.211
You go ahead and whip out that tiny teddy...

14:07.313 --> 14:09.873
and then we're gonna think up
a fun safe word.

14:09.982 --> 14:13.213
George Michael,
I did not know that you were...

14:14.353 --> 14:17.914
Um, go ahead and talk out here.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.923
Just got back
from the "bumpaddle" courts.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.959
Tomorrow, I'm teachin' her baseball.

14:22.061 --> 14:23.926
- It might take a while.
- Sorry?

14:24.029 --> 14:26.395
Listen, Dad, th-this is... hard...

14:26.498 --> 14:28.659
This is hard for me to say.

14:28.767 --> 14:33.795
I was videotaping Rita. Let's just say it
would be cute if it was someone much younger.

14:35.908 --> 14:39.002
I'm sorry. Maybe I should get another tape.
They're not expensive.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.249
That's the plastic fruit, Dad.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.980
It's very convincing fruit. Okay?

14:49.088 --> 14:53.354
And... She's goin'
back in for another?

14:53.459 --> 14:57.361
You know, they don't even have bananas
in England. Okay, Son?

14:57.463 --> 14:59.795
Now, I know this is hard for you...

14:59.899 --> 15:03.630
but it would be nice
to be supported in some...

15:03.736 --> 15:05.704
Now she's goin' into the grapes.

15:05.804 --> 15:08.170
Yeah. She really liked those.

15:08.274 --> 15:10.538
I'm sorry.

15:10.643 --> 15:14.511
I think she might be...
retar-retarded.

15:16.715 --> 15:19.479
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

15:24.356 --> 15:26.654
Say hello to my tiny teddy.

15:27.759 --> 15:30.855
Tiny Teddy? Oh!

15:30.963 --> 15:33.227
<i>And that's when it dawned on Michael.</i>

15:33.332 --> 15:36.130
- Oh, you teach kids, huh?
- I like to think they teach me.

15:37.303 --> 15:39.794
That way I can see
if you have a monster.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.572
Be careful.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.917
I have made a huge mistake.

16:02.828 --> 16:05.388
<i>Michael had just been shown...</i>

16:05.497 --> 16:07.465
<i>that his fiancÃ©e
might be mentally challenged.</i>

16:07.566 --> 16:10.262
- So, <i>- But he needed proof.</i>
- are you ready for lie-down kisses with me?

16:10.369 --> 16:12.633
Maybe we oughta just talk a little bit.

16:12.738 --> 16:15.673
I mean, what the heck?
For instance, you've never told me...

16:15.774 --> 16:18.265
how many houses there are
in the British Parliament.

16:18.377 --> 16:20.675
- Seven.
- Are there?

16:20.779 --> 16:23.509
<i>- The answer is three.</i>
- Does sound about right.

16:23.615 --> 16:25.708
<i>Three is the correct answer.</i>

16:25.818 --> 16:28.582
- Rita... Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Come on. Let's have our fun!

16:28.687 --> 16:32.145
Rita corny Michael.

16:32.257 --> 16:35.283
<i>So Michael used a line
that was just as corny.</i>

16:35.394 --> 16:37.885
You know,
I think that we should wait...

16:37.997 --> 16:40.261
until after we're married.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.299
Married!
Married, married, married!

16:45.404 --> 16:47.702
Okay! Night-night!

16:47.806 --> 16:52.539
<i>And Michael felt he deserved
a $15 thing of candy beans.</i>

16:57.850 --> 17:01.342
<i>The next morning, however,
as Michael prepared to let Rita down gently...</i>

17:01.453 --> 17:03.921
<i>- he was met with another surprise.</i>
- Surprise!

17:04.022 --> 17:06.651
- What's this?
- We're throwing you a wedding.

17:06.759 --> 17:10.888
- Oh, how lovely!
- On us.

17:10.996 --> 17:13.726
Everything you see.
Show him the waffle bar, Larry.

17:13.832 --> 17:16.561
- It's over there.
- And check out banner, Michael.

17:16.667 --> 17:19.432
I'm gonna go set up.

17:19.538 --> 17:22.165
I was just gonna talk to Rita
about all of this.

17:22.273 --> 17:26.904
Rita, I think that we should, um,
wait a little while.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.412
Wait? Why?
I don't wanna wait.

17:29.515 --> 17:35.181
I want to get married and have
sexual relations like you promised.

17:35.287 --> 17:38.984
Where did you get this firecracker?
I love her, Michael.

17:39.091 --> 17:41.616
So do I. I wanna kiss
my new daughter-in-law.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.321
- Hey, not on our time, Larry.
- Right on the lips.

17:44.430 --> 17:48.127
- No, no. Please, take it easy.
- I'm gonna get my dress from the... from the room.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.428
Yes. I'll help you
put it on inside-out.

17:50.536 --> 17:53.403
Let's... Let's not all get, um...

17:53.505 --> 17:56.269
Mom, what's goin' on? I thought
you guys were against all this.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.343
Well, we feel
that you know best...

17:58.444 --> 18:01.174
and who are we to interfere,
and you love this girl.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.477
And the rest will just be
little happy surprises...

18:04.583 --> 18:07.381
- along the way, like you said.
- Yeah.

18:07.486 --> 18:10.614
With the exception
of the retard thing.

18:10.722 --> 18:14.453
- Oh, God.
- Tell me you didn't just say that.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.651
You knew?

18:17.162 --> 18:19.392
You knew, yet you still wanted me
to go through with this.

18:19.498 --> 18:22.797
What can I say?
I'm crazy about the little dullard.

18:22.901 --> 18:24.960
Oh, my God. She's rich.

18:25.070 --> 18:28.005
This is a new low,
even for you, Mom.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.477
What is wrong with you?

18:32.578 --> 18:34.478
Larry, go to a mirror.

18:36.915 --> 18:39.179
- You're fired.
- You're fired. What?

18:39.284 --> 18:43.015
It's over. And this is how you tell me...
in the middle of a wedding?

18:43.122 --> 18:45.147
<i>You shouldn't have said anything.</i>
You <i>shouldn't have said anything.</i>

18:45.257 --> 18:47.316
You were right.
Now what am I gonna do?

18:47.426 --> 18:51.021
I've been thinking. Every society
has their own rules about this stuff.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.826
For instance, in some states,
it's legal to marry your own cousin.

18:53.932 --> 18:57.925
California's blocked it twice, but only because
they tacked it onto an estate law thing.

18:58.036 --> 19:00.334
- We had the signatures.
- You're 16, and you know all that.

19:00.439 --> 19:03.408
She's 30 and a half. She probably can't list
the seven houses of Parliament.

19:03.509 --> 19:05.773
- There's three.
- Now I gotta break her heart.

19:05.878 --> 19:08.506
Doesn't she have to leave the country
if you don't marry her?

19:08.614 --> 19:11.879
Yeah, I guess I can keep my promise
about that, huh?

19:11.984 --> 19:13.952
There wouldn't be any
real intimacy...

19:14.052 --> 19:16.953
and it would be the strongest marriage
in the family.

19:17.055 --> 19:21.549
But as much as I'd like to, you can't ignore
the fact that she is mentally disabled.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.685
Oh, my God.

19:26.131 --> 19:28.099
I'm wearing an inside-out
bridesmaid's dress.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.863
- You'd better catch her, Dad.
- Not gonna be easy. She's an Olympic silver...

19:34.072 --> 19:36.131
I just figured that one out.

19:36.241 --> 19:40.803
Okay. Well, I have to go stop production
on <i>The Ocean Walker.</i>

19:43.482 --> 19:46.883
- You found out.
- Took me long enough.

19:46.985 --> 19:52.821
Maybe you're not smart either.
I didn't know until they told me.

19:52.925 --> 19:56.088
No. I'm just a narcissist
who was too self-involved to see the truth.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.890
That makes no sense to me.

19:57.996 --> 20:00.829
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm being too hard on myself.

20:00.933 --> 20:05.029
You know, the truth is...
is that I did just see what I wanted to see.

20:05.137 --> 20:08.573
Rita, you're so beautiful,
and you're so sweet.

20:08.674 --> 20:12.474
And you deserve to find somebody
a lot more like you.

20:12.578 --> 20:15.775
I don't think that either one of us
would be happy.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.974
So, it's bye-bye to Rita then?

20:18.083 --> 20:20.415
Unless you really want
to stay in America.

20:20.519 --> 20:24.478
- I wanted to be with you.
- Hoy! Rita!

20:24.590 --> 20:27.684
Time to go now.
Back to England, love.

20:27.793 --> 20:30.921
Oh, Michael, will you
come visit me lots?

20:31.029 --> 20:34.430
That's gonna be difficult, Rita.
You're gonna be across an ocean.

20:34.533 --> 20:37.093
- Well, you can always walk.
- Not on the water.

20:37.202 --> 20:40.433
Oh, Michael, you're such a grown-up.

20:47.379 --> 20:49.279
Hey! He-Hey!

20:53.051 --> 20:56.043
Hang on a sec.
That's part of your trick, right?

20:56.154 --> 20:59.646
No. That's not my trick, Michael.

21:04.062 --> 21:06.223
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

21:06.331 --> 21:09.027
It's my <i>illusion!</i>

21:09.134 --> 21:11.125
<i>Michael relives a wedding nightmare.</i>

21:11.236 --> 21:13.796
- Help! Put him out!
- My hair! My beautiful hair!

21:13.905 --> 21:17.170
- Push him in the pool!
- Why am I not going underwater?

21:17.276 --> 21:20.643
Dear God! Why am I not going underwater?
