WEBVTT

00:11.458 --> 00:11.667
Ray?
Motherfucker!

00:11.750 --> 00:13.959
Hey!

00:14.041 --> 00:15.208
Why's he talking to my father?

00:15.291 --> 00:16.750
(shouts) God!
You better fucking

00:16.834 --> 00:18.583
find out,
or I'll tell your wife

00:18.667 --> 00:20.458
about that kid you support
in Riverside.

00:20.542 --> 00:21.041
What do you got?
Murder.

00:21.125 --> 00:23.750
Involving Sean Walker.

00:23.834 --> 00:25.083
FRANK: Van Miller's
off the reservation.

00:25.166 --> 00:26.625
There's nothing I can do
about him now.

00:26.709 --> 00:27.417
RAY:
Wait in your office.

00:27.500 --> 00:30.250
I'm sending something over now.

00:30.333 --> 00:32.792
Now touch your nose.

00:32.875 --> 00:34.583
And I got an idea for a movie

00:34.667 --> 00:35.250
you should do.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.125
It's about an unknown actor

00:37.208 --> 00:38.750
and he ends up shooting a
young woman in the head.

00:38.834 --> 00:41.250
Then he frames a working Joe

00:41.333 --> 00:43.250
from an honest family
for the murder.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.959
If I buy this story, I own it.

00:46.041 --> 00:48.375
You cannot share
this with anyone.

00:48.458 --> 00:49.333
I'm wiring you up.
You're gonna get in there

00:49.417 --> 00:51.458
and get a confession
out of Sean Walker.

00:51.542 --> 00:52.333
Or you're going back
to Walpole.

00:52.417 --> 00:54.959
There's witnesses here.
Your children.

00:55.041 --> 00:56.458
TERRY:
Whoa, whoa, Ray, Ray, Ray!
It wasn't his fault!

00:56.542 --> 00:58.625
It just got out of hand!

00:58.709 --> 00:59.959
Where you going now?
Boston.

01:00.041 --> 01:01.625
Why the fuck are you going
to Boston?

01:01.709 --> 01:02.792
I'm here to see Sully.

01:02.875 --> 01:04.792
What are you doing here, Ray?

01:04.875 --> 01:06.709
I want you to kill my father.

01:06.792 --> 01:09.166
(sighs) I thought my family
was fucking screwed up.

01:18.959 --> 01:21.125
(wind whistling softly)

01:35.750 --> 01:37.667
(exhales)

01:37.750 --> 01:40.166
(inhales sharply)

01:40.250 --> 01:42.500
Uh, we need to stop.
Sully has to pee.

01:42.583 --> 01:44.333
Shut the fuck up.
You need to go.

01:44.417 --> 01:45.000
You're bouncing your leg.

01:45.083 --> 01:46.959
He's got a bladder problem.

01:47.041 --> 01:48.375
Shut the fuck up.

01:48.458 --> 01:51.125
We stopped a half hour ago.
Yeah.

01:51.208 --> 01:52.125
Well, tough shit. Pull over.

01:52.208 --> 01:54.959
If we keep stopping,
it's going to take us

01:55.041 --> 01:56.250
two weeks to get there.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.250
We've got nothing but time, pal.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.166
(turn signal clicking)

02:09.125 --> 02:11.291
(crickets chirping)

02:19.000 --> 02:21.291
(sighs)

02:23.834 --> 02:26.125
What's up, Con?

02:29.667 --> 02:31.125
(chuckles softly)

02:31.208 --> 02:33.166
What's the matter?
You're not talking to me?

02:34.375 --> 02:36.458
The Kids' Choice Awards
are tonight.

02:36.542 --> 02:37.959
Tomorrow night. Whatever.

02:38.041 --> 02:39.709
It is?

02:39.792 --> 02:42.291
Yeah, I told you
two weeks ago.

02:42.375 --> 02:44.417
You said you'd arrange it
so I could go with Tommy,

02:44.500 --> 02:45.375
and you didn't.
He's nominated.

02:48.333 --> 02:49.583
It's for kids though.

02:49.667 --> 02:51.041
You really want to go
to that thing?

02:51.125 --> 02:53.166
Yeah. I do.

02:53.250 --> 02:55.583
Look, I know you think
he's a perv.

02:55.667 --> 02:57.792
He's not.

02:57.875 --> 02:59.166
He likes trannies.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.625
And girls
when he's drunk.

03:05.875 --> 03:06.875
You seem
to know him pretty well.

03:06.959 --> 03:09.583
He's my friend.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.500
He's never done anything to me.

03:11.583 --> 03:13.417
And if he did, I know
how to take care of myself.

03:16.125 --> 03:17.750
All right.

03:17.834 --> 03:19.875
I'll talk to Tommy.

03:19.959 --> 03:21.625
Bullshit.

03:21.709 --> 03:24.000
Hey!

03:24.083 --> 03:25.917
I'll call him in the morning.

03:37.875 --> 03:39.709
(urine sloshing)
It's cold as
shit out here.

03:39.792 --> 03:41.000
I thought the desert
was supposed to be hot.

03:41.083 --> 03:43.500
Yap, yap, yap,
yap, yap.

03:43.583 --> 03:44.458
Just saying.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.625
What, now you're
the fucking weather girl?

03:46.709 --> 03:48.750
(phone ringing)

03:50.709 --> 03:51.959
Yes, Ray?
Why are you stopped?

03:52.041 --> 03:56.041
Because every five minutes,
one of them has to take a piss.

03:56.125 --> 03:57.834
And now the dog...

03:57.917 --> 04:00.291
I don't give a shit.
I don't care if you got to put

04:00.375 --> 04:02.166
fucking diapers on 'em.
You get 'em to L.A. today.

04:02.250 --> 04:02.709
You hear me, Avi?

04:02.792 --> 04:05.291
Okay.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.625
Let's go.

04:08.291 --> 04:11.041
Where are we?

04:11.125 --> 04:12.500
New Mexico.

04:12.583 --> 04:15.417
Looks like fucking Mars.

04:15.500 --> 04:16.291
Everything
off the jab.

04:16.375 --> 04:19.250
You're gonna get
killed inside here.

04:19.333 --> 04:20.875
And then move out.
Move out.

04:20.959 --> 04:21.834
Hey!

04:21.917 --> 04:24.458
The flyers are here.

04:24.542 --> 04:27.083
Flyers are here.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.667
(chuckles)

04:28.750 --> 04:29.542
Aw, cool.

04:29.625 --> 04:34.000
TERRY: Daryll
"Black Irish" Donovan?

04:34.083 --> 04:35.291
Yeah. He's black
and he's Irish.

04:35.375 --> 04:38.041
(laughs):
What do you want?

04:38.125 --> 04:40.375
Hey. Here.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.083
Uh, your mother coming?

04:43.166 --> 04:44.792
Yeah, she said she was.

04:44.875 --> 04:47.125
Good. She bringing
that Yid husband?

04:47.208 --> 04:49.083
DARYLL: God, I hope not.
Fucking dickhead.

04:49.166 --> 04:50.417
Can I help you?

04:50.500 --> 04:53.041
Mickey, we need to talk.

04:54.583 --> 04:55.625
Right now.

04:55.709 --> 04:58.125
Looks like you got
a new fighter, Ter.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.083
I think he wants
to glove up.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.583
You want to do this out here?

05:02.667 --> 05:03.709
What's going on?

05:03.792 --> 05:04.375
This doesn't concern you.

05:04.458 --> 05:06.208
Hey, this is
my place.

05:06.291 --> 05:07.333
Everything here
concerns me.

05:07.417 --> 05:08.667
Who the fuck are you?

05:08.750 --> 05:10.417
I cannot disclose
that information,

05:10.500 --> 05:12.834
and I need to talk
to your father right now.

05:12.917 --> 05:15.041
Oh...
(chuckles):
Who is this guy?

05:15.125 --> 05:17.375
You want me to
throw him out?
Yeah.

05:17.458 --> 05:19.792
Don't touch me!

05:19.875 --> 05:21.834
MICKEY:
Relax.

05:21.917 --> 05:23.291
I'm just fucking around
with you.

05:23.375 --> 05:26.250
Over here.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.750
Who's that?

05:27.834 --> 05:30.375
I don't know.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.000
Maybe his parole officer.

05:35.083 --> 05:36.208
Don't worry
about it, Bunch.

05:36.291 --> 05:39.417
(quietly):
Don't you ever

05:39.500 --> 05:41.375
talk to me like that
in front of my kids.

05:41.458 --> 05:44.417
I will talk to you
any way I damn please.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.417
Oh, yeah?

05:45.500 --> 05:47.500
I want you...

05:47.583 --> 05:50.125
to call Sean Walker right now

05:50.208 --> 05:52.959
and set up a meeting
to see him today.

05:55.041 --> 05:56.750
How we gonna get his number?

05:56.834 --> 05:57.458
Stop with the crap.

05:57.542 --> 05:59.834
You just saw him last week.

05:59.917 --> 06:01.458
Yeah.

06:01.542 --> 06:03.250
I know all about
your overall deal, Mick.

06:03.333 --> 06:04.500
Well, maybe I don't want

06:04.583 --> 06:08.333
to compromise my future
as a screenwriter.

06:09.625 --> 06:11.583
(laughing)

06:11.667 --> 06:14.417
You find that amusing?

06:14.500 --> 06:16.000
Yeah.

06:17.792 --> 06:21.333
You actually think
he's gonna make your movie?

06:21.417 --> 06:23.041
Oh, he's gonna make
that fucking movie.

06:23.125 --> 06:26.458
He's stringing you along
to keep you quiet.

06:26.542 --> 06:30.166
Christ. How fucking stupid
can you get?

06:34.875 --> 06:36.625
Call him.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.458
BUNCHY:
Hey, Pop.

06:50.542 --> 06:52.291
Where you going?

06:52.375 --> 06:55.083
I told you guys
I was in the movie business.

06:55.166 --> 06:57.083
I got a meeting on the lot.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.375
Shut your mouth.
Let's go.

07:20.583 --> 07:22.542
Why are you avoiding me, Frank?

07:22.625 --> 07:24.291
Jesus.

07:24.375 --> 07:27.500
What the fuck are you doing?
I was in the neighborhood.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.417
How the hell
did you even get in here?

07:29.500 --> 07:31.375
Did anybody see you?

07:31.458 --> 07:33.709
You're worrying
about the wrong things, Frank.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.208
I gave you the ammunition.

07:41.291 --> 07:43.375
You got photos
of Van Miller

07:43.458 --> 07:45.750
tripping his balls off,
hair samples, video.

07:45.834 --> 07:47.834
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

07:47.917 --> 07:49.709
You act like
it's so fucking simple.

07:49.792 --> 07:52.125
Like I can just walk down there
and throw this shit on a desk.

07:52.208 --> 07:53.291
Today.

08:05.458 --> 08:06.583
Did you take your
heart medicine?

08:06.667 --> 08:09.208
WOMAN:
No, no, Avi, I don't have it.

08:09.291 --> 08:11.500
So send Joey to the CVS.

08:11.583 --> 08:13.166
Oh, not today.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.583
Yes, today.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.291
That's right.
The blood thinner.

08:16.375 --> 08:18.000
Okay.
Okay, I got to go.

08:18.083 --> 08:19.000
(speaks Hebrew)

08:19.083 --> 08:21.250
Me, too. Bye-bye.

08:21.333 --> 08:22.458
Your mother?

08:22.542 --> 08:24.166
I'm usually there
on Fridays.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.542
Mm.
Shabbat.

08:25.625 --> 08:27.709
Only thing I'm gonna miss
is my mother.

08:27.792 --> 08:31.583
She's 92 and can still
kick my ass at Jeopardy.

08:31.667 --> 08:34.041
She keeps those nurses
on their toes, let me tell you.

08:34.125 --> 08:35.250
They got no idea
what they're in for

08:35.333 --> 08:38.083
without me there to protect 'em.

08:38.166 --> 08:39.667
(chuckles)

08:39.750 --> 08:41.417
How old is yours?

08:41.500 --> 08:44.291
85.

08:44.375 --> 08:46.834
She's starting
to lose it, man.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.625
She sideswiped three cars
in the last month.

08:49.709 --> 08:51.041
(laughs)
I had to take
her keys away.

08:51.125 --> 08:53.875
God bless 'em.

08:53.959 --> 08:55.875
Sully is the FBI's most wanted,

08:55.959 --> 08:59.291
but all his mother has to do is
snap her fingers, and he jumps.

08:59.375 --> 08:59.917
Shut the fuck up,

09:00.000 --> 09:01.959
you cunt.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.125
You should've
stayed behind

09:03.208 --> 09:05.542
to take care of her.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.834
MAN:
That .38's a beauty.

09:12.917 --> 09:16.834
That has a bodyguard on it
so it won't snag your pants.

09:16.917 --> 09:19.291
(phone ringing)

09:23.125 --> 09:24.125
Shit.

09:24.208 --> 09:25.875
Hey, Conor.

09:25.959 --> 09:29.000
Dad, are you really gonna get me
in the awards with Tommy?

09:29.083 --> 09:30.750
Yeah.

09:30.834 --> 09:33.750
'Cause Jimmy wants to go see
the new Batman movie tonight.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.917
I'm working on it right now.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.917
Tell your mom to buy you a suit
and take you over to Amelio's.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.083
What about school?

09:42.166 --> 09:44.208
You're skipping school today.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.834
(chuckles softly)

09:52.875 --> 09:55.667
I'll take the, uh,
.38 and the nine.

09:55.750 --> 09:58.291
Okay. You know, uh...

09:58.375 --> 10:01.333
I got my kid a little tux
for his first communion.

10:01.417 --> 10:03.458
I wept like a baby.

10:03.542 --> 10:05.250
Kills you, huh?

10:05.333 --> 10:08.166
Fuckin' kids.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.250
It was good
to see you again, Ray.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.709
Always a pleasure
doing business with you.

10:11.792 --> 10:13.834
Yeah.

10:22.125 --> 10:22.250
(sighs)

10:23.959 --> 10:25.333
(dialing)

10:25.417 --> 10:27.875
(cell phone ringing)

10:39.291 --> 10:41.000
Hello, Ray.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.375
Yeah.

10:42.458 --> 10:43.250
That children awards thing
tonight?

10:43.333 --> 10:46.083
You're taking Conor.

10:46.166 --> 10:47.834
I can't go, Ray.

10:47.917 --> 10:50.667
Why not?

10:50.750 --> 10:54.375
Because Marty Grossman is
going to publish photos of me.

10:54.458 --> 10:56.834
What photos?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.375
Of me and my wife.

11:00.458 --> 11:03.458
(sniffles)
She left me, Ray.

11:03.542 --> 11:05.000
What wife?
When did you get married?

11:05.083 --> 11:06.750
Chloe.
(sniffles)

11:06.834 --> 11:08.834
Two nights ago in Vegas.

11:08.917 --> 11:11.083
Jesus, Tommy. That's a man.

11:11.166 --> 11:14.375
Technically... yes.

11:14.458 --> 11:15.667
But I don't care
what the law says.

11:15.750 --> 11:19.041
The pastor
pronounced her my wife.

11:19.125 --> 11:20.083
All right, you listen to me.

11:20.166 --> 11:22.333
My kid's going
to that awards thing tonight,

11:22.417 --> 11:23.667
and you're taking him.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.375
I want you to text me
where you are

11:25.458 --> 11:27.667
and meet me outside
in 15 minutes. And, Tommy,

11:27.750 --> 11:31.250
do not make me come inside
and look for you.

11:38.542 --> 11:40.583
(man speaking in French)

11:40.667 --> 11:42.583
(digital camera beeping)

11:42.667 --> 11:43.875
(man and woman
chattering in French)

11:46.709 --> 11:48.333
(man laughs)

11:52.208 --> 11:54.667
(man shouting in French)
Come on, Tommy.
Let's go.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.625
What the fuck
is on your head?

11:57.709 --> 11:59.792
My heart is broken.
How can you ask me that?

11:59.875 --> 12:01.291
(car door opens, closes)
Come on, get him!

12:03.375 --> 12:06.667
I fucked it up, Ray.

12:06.750 --> 12:10.041
I'm so sorry, man.
I fuck up everything.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.458
(sighs)

12:11.542 --> 12:13.166
Maybe I should just kill myself.

12:13.250 --> 12:14.959
Kill yourself tomorrow.
Tonight you're going

12:15.041 --> 12:17.667
to this awards thing,
and you're taking my kid.

12:20.458 --> 12:23.000
Where are we going?

12:23.083 --> 12:25.000
(sighs)
We got to go see Marty.

12:25.083 --> 12:26.625
He already called me
for comment.

12:26.709 --> 12:30.041
I told him that we were in love.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.458
(sighs)

12:31.542 --> 12:33.291
When Marty Grossman
calls you for a comment,

12:33.375 --> 12:35.000
he doesn't want a
comment, you idiot.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.417
He wants money.

12:40.125 --> 12:45.041
Did you know that only one
celebrity has been convicted

12:45.125 --> 12:48.041
of a felony in
over 20 years?

12:48.125 --> 12:52.417
O.J., Robert Blake,
the list goes on and on.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.417
They flash their smiles,
and the jury gets blinded.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.458
Just the way you were.

12:56.542 --> 12:59.500
Go fuck yourself.

12:59.583 --> 13:00.166
These people.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.583
(scoffs)

13:02.667 --> 13:05.500
These people live...

13:05.583 --> 13:07.333
without consequences.

13:07.417 --> 13:10.333
Yeah, whatever.

13:10.417 --> 13:13.250
Sean Walker.

13:13.333 --> 13:18.375
Did you know that he blinks
every time he pulls the trigger

13:18.458 --> 13:20.000
in one of his movies?

13:20.083 --> 13:21.333
That's a fact that's
interesting to you?

13:21.417 --> 13:22.417
You're still such a fan, Mickey?

13:22.500 --> 13:24.083
I'll make sure you have
a DVD player in your cell

13:24.166 --> 13:27.000
so you can watch all your
favorite Sean Walker movies.

13:27.083 --> 13:29.583
I know what
I'm going in there to do.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.625
Let's do it.
(recorder clicks)

13:31.709 --> 13:34.417
Oh, let's check
these levels.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.041
Fuck you, one, two, three.
Fuck you, one, two, three.

13:37.125 --> 13:39.041
Fuck you, one, two, three.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.750
Excuse me.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.000
I think
you're very beautiful.

13:57.083 --> 13:58.750
Would you mind
if I took your picture?

13:58.834 --> 14:00.291
Uh, hi. I'm her mother.

14:00.375 --> 14:01.709
Oh, well, then that's
where she gets it.

14:01.792 --> 14:03.250
Gets what?

14:03.333 --> 14:06.250
Forgive me.
I'm-I'm Avon Loma.

14:06.333 --> 14:07.166
The photographer?

14:07.250 --> 14:10.000
Sorry, you've probably
never heard of me.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.542
Um, I was just admiring
your daughter's bone structure.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.792
Oh. (laughs)
Oh, thank you.

14:14.875 --> 14:16.917
Look, um, we are so far behind.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Jaguar would probably kill me
for even being here,

14:19.083 --> 14:20.041
but can I give you my card?

14:20.125 --> 14:22.709
You see, I'm-I'm prepping
a spot for Levi's,

14:22.792 --> 14:24.917
and I'd love to show your stuff
to the client.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.542
Really?

14:26.625 --> 14:28.583
Yeah. Do you think you guys
could possibly come in around...

14:28.667 --> 14:31.417
5:00? I could take
some test photos then.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.125
Mom, please?

14:36.375 --> 14:38.792
Okay.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.625
All right, I'll see you then.
Nice to meet you.

14:40.709 --> 14:43.208
(whispers)
(laughs)

14:51.041 --> 14:53.333
Stay in the car.

15:03.208 --> 15:05.333
Marty.
Ray.

15:05.417 --> 15:07.625
You're not getting a dime
out of Tommy Wheeler.

15:07.709 --> 15:09.083
Kill the photos,
kill the story.

15:09.166 --> 15:09.625
No fuckin' way, Ray.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.041
Tommy's in a tuxedo,

15:11.125 --> 15:14.083
the he-she's wearing
a full bridal gown.

15:14.166 --> 15:15.625
(laughing)
Un-fucking-believable.

15:15.709 --> 15:17.375
RAY:
We had a deal.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.959
I gave you Sean Walker's baby
less than a year ago.

15:19.041 --> 15:21.500
Yeah, what kind of story
is that?

15:21.583 --> 15:23.208
He got the egg
from his assistant?

15:23.291 --> 15:24.667
Big fucking deal.

15:24.750 --> 15:26.333
Big fucking deal.
And I killed

15:26.417 --> 15:29.834
all the Sean Walker Scientology
rumors, so we're even.

15:29.917 --> 15:31.792
I'm not scared of you anymore.

15:31.875 --> 15:33.500
You should be.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.125
Fuck you.

15:35.208 --> 15:37.166
I'm tired of you motherfuckers
threatening me

15:37.250 --> 15:37.917
for the past ten years.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.917
I'm not threatening you, Marty.

15:40.000 --> 15:40.750
Very funny.
Very funny.

15:40.834 --> 15:44.583
I've got protection now.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.834
I do whatever
the fuck I want.

15:47.917 --> 15:49.917
I'm gonna time it exactly.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.834
It's gonna be great when Tommy's
up there accepting his award,

15:52.917 --> 15:55.125
and all those
cell phones start beeping.

15:56.917 --> 15:59.625
All right.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.250
(chuckles)

16:02.333 --> 16:03.083
(women laughing)

16:03.166 --> 16:05.542
So I'm getting pulled over.
Yeah?

16:05.625 --> 16:06.709
There's a 30-foot
cloud of smoke billowing

16:06.792 --> 16:09.333
from the back of my car.
What?

16:09.417 --> 16:11.542
I open the door,
fall flat on my face,

16:11.625 --> 16:13.417
and scream at the top
of my lungs,

16:13.500 --> 16:15.375
"It's okay, Officer! I just had
my parking brake on!"

16:15.458 --> 16:17.709
(laughter)

16:17.792 --> 16:20.667
And then what happened?

16:20.750 --> 16:24.291
My stand-in just had
to do some community service.

16:24.375 --> 16:25.542
(laughs)

16:27.166 --> 16:28.792
You have beautiful eyes.

16:28.875 --> 16:31.208
(sniffles)

16:34.250 --> 16:36.542
Goddamn it.

16:46.959 --> 16:49.917
(women laughing)

16:50.000 --> 16:52.125
Oh, my God!
What?

16:52.208 --> 16:53.500
WOMAN:
What the fuck?!

16:53.583 --> 16:55.458
Are you okay?
What'd you just do?

16:55.542 --> 16:56.875
WOMAN: Oh, my God!
(laughs)
What happened?

16:56.959 --> 16:58.291
He just-- he put
his penis in my hand!

16:58.375 --> 16:59.583
He put his fucking
penis in my hand!

16:59.667 --> 17:01.417
Get in the fucking car. Now!

17:01.500 --> 17:04.417
Okay.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.000
Oh, my God.

17:06.083 --> 17:08.625
I'm sorry about that.

17:08.709 --> 17:11.458
Can I talk to you
for a second?

17:11.542 --> 17:13.667
Excuse me.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.834
You know who he is, right?

17:18.917 --> 17:20.417
Yes.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.000
Listen, Tommy's having a
real hard time right now.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.125
I need you to help me out here

17:24.208 --> 17:27.792
and not tell anyone else
about this.

17:27.875 --> 17:29.417
Can you do that?

17:35.709 --> 17:37.917
Maybe.

17:42.750 --> 17:45.375
ABBY:
Look at you.

17:45.458 --> 17:46.625
My handsome little man.

17:46.709 --> 17:48.667
It's pretty good, right?

17:48.750 --> 17:50.166
You want cuffs on your trouser?

17:50.250 --> 17:51.792
Mom?

17:51.875 --> 17:54.291
I don't know.
Let's ask your dad.

17:59.875 --> 18:01.125
(camera clicks)
All right.

18:01.208 --> 18:03.333
(clears throat)

18:03.417 --> 18:04.792
It's a bar mitzvah?

18:04.875 --> 18:06.709
No. Kids' Choice Awards tonight.

18:06.792 --> 18:07.333
A guest of Tommy Wheeler.

18:08.792 --> 18:11.667
(phone chimes)

18:11.750 --> 18:15.000
(phone ringing)

18:15.083 --> 18:16.417
ABBY:
Hi.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.458
Is this awards show for real?

18:18.542 --> 18:21.959
If it's not gonna happen,
I'd rather tell him now.

18:22.959 --> 18:25.458
Don't worry.
It's gonna happen.

18:25.542 --> 18:27.333
Tell Conor he looks great.

18:27.417 --> 18:31.667
He says you look
real handsome, honey.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.750
Should Conor have cuffs?

18:33.834 --> 18:35.291
Absolutely not.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.542
(laughs):
Okay.

18:37.834 --> 18:40.417
No cuffs.

18:45.834 --> 18:49.083
What the fuck, man?!

18:49.166 --> 18:50.875
Sober the fuck up.

18:50.959 --> 18:53.250
(sighs)
Where's your fucking
shirt, by the way?

18:53.333 --> 18:55.542
I don't know, man. You know
how many drugs I did last night?

18:55.625 --> 18:57.208
I don't want to know.

18:57.291 --> 18:58.417
(sighs):
Oh!

18:58.500 --> 19:02.542
There are three rules
for making a Sean Walker film.

19:02.625 --> 19:03.375
I had no idea.

19:03.458 --> 19:06.750
One: I always walk
towards danger.

19:06.834 --> 19:08.250
Two:

19:08.333 --> 19:11.250
I overcome odds not with muscle,
but because I care.

19:11.333 --> 19:15.041
And three: people feel great
when it's over.

19:15.125 --> 19:16.041
When they leave
that theater,

19:16.125 --> 19:20.667
they want to fight
for what's right.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.291
(sighs)
What?

19:27.917 --> 19:31.917
Was it right for a son
to frame his father for murder?

19:36.417 --> 19:38.417
Rebecca, could you please
leave the room?

19:41.834 --> 19:44.041
Thank you.

19:45.208 --> 19:46.959
Mickey, you got to
be careful here.

19:47.041 --> 19:49.417
This movie that we are
making is fiction.

19:49.500 --> 19:53.250
No one is really guilty for
that night. Accidents happen.

19:53.333 --> 19:55.083
Accidents?

19:55.166 --> 19:57.917
You blew
her fucking brains out.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.125
You ever think about that?

20:01.333 --> 20:02.959
No.

20:03.041 --> 20:04.792
I've worked all that out.

20:04.875 --> 20:08.542
In a certain point in one's
spiritual development,

20:08.625 --> 20:11.750
you process things,
and you move on.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.458
And I've named a charity
after her,

20:16.542 --> 20:18.458
for victims of genital
mutilation in the Sudan.

20:21.041 --> 20:22.500
Colleen's Children.

20:26.458 --> 20:29.959
Yeah. All right,
thank you, Suki.

20:32.333 --> 20:34.500
It's all set.
Conor is my guest for tonight.

20:34.583 --> 20:36.208
Good.

20:38.458 --> 20:40.375
Are we good, Doc?

20:40.458 --> 20:41.959
As a medical professional,
I have to tell you,

20:42.041 --> 20:44.625
this man needs treatment.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.375
He needs detox.

20:46.458 --> 20:47.125
Here. Thank you.

20:47.208 --> 20:49.959
Jesus, what the fuck is that?

20:50.041 --> 20:51.792
That's the niacin.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.333
(laughs):
Oh.

20:53.417 --> 20:54.709
Oh, God.

20:54.792 --> 20:56.583
I'm getting a hard-on, Ray.

20:59.041 --> 20:59.667
(sighs):
Oh.

20:59.750 --> 21:02.083
(laughs)

21:05.750 --> 21:08.500
Can you turn the AC on?

21:08.583 --> 21:09.458
It is on.

21:09.542 --> 21:10.625
He's telling the truth.

21:10.709 --> 21:12.583
Menopause.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.291
CATHERINE:
I don't feel so good.
Baby's getting sick.

21:14.375 --> 21:16.375
It's this car.
I need a rest.

21:16.458 --> 21:18.333
Couldn't we just get a room
for a bit?

21:18.417 --> 21:18.875
We are not stopping.

21:18.959 --> 21:21.667
CATHERINE:
Oh, no!

21:21.750 --> 21:23.458
What the fuck is the matter now?

21:23.542 --> 21:24.041
Oh, he's hypersalivating!

21:24.125 --> 21:26.125
He's hypersalivating!

21:26.208 --> 21:28.750
He can't take the heat!

21:28.834 --> 21:29.959
Poor Baby's so hot!

21:30.041 --> 21:31.458
This ain't gonna stop.
Oh!

21:31.542 --> 21:33.083
If we just stick her
in a motel

21:33.166 --> 21:34.625
for a couple hours,
we'll be fine.

21:34.709 --> 21:35.375
CATHERINE:
It's gonna be okay.

21:35.458 --> 21:37.458
Oh, my God, I'm dying.
I'm dying!

21:40.250 --> 21:42.667
Hey, you need something, boss?

21:42.750 --> 21:43.667
What do we got on
Marty Grossman?

21:43.750 --> 21:46.083
Oh, not much. He just
beefed up his security.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.500
I know. Derek
de la Fontaine.

21:47.583 --> 21:48.208
What about this Chip guy?

21:48.291 --> 21:50.375
I think it's his boyfriend.

21:50.458 --> 21:52.834
TOMMY:
Ray?

21:54.792 --> 21:56.041
Marty texted me again.

21:56.125 --> 21:56.959
He asked for another comment.

21:57.041 --> 21:59.125
Motherfucker.

21:59.208 --> 22:01.166
Ray, I've been thinking.

22:01.250 --> 22:01.959
Maybe I should just pay him.

22:02.041 --> 22:04.542
I need my career, man.

22:04.625 --> 22:05.875
I'm an actor.

22:05.959 --> 22:07.375
I have to act.

22:07.458 --> 22:10.542
And my agent's just
sent me a great script,

22:10.625 --> 22:13.458
but the whole thing will fall
through if we don't make a deal.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.625
I ordered a check
for two million dollars.

22:21.458 --> 22:24.875
Good. Good.

remember her looking up at me.

22:36.792 --> 22:39.500

22:43.667 --> 22:45.125
Yeah.

MICKEY:
How did it feel?

22:47.083 --> 22:49.208
SEAN:
Feel?

22:52.166 --> 22:54.709
It was the worst moment
of my life.

22:54.792 --> 22:58.834
I saw this little
hole in her head.

22:58.917 --> 23:02.458
She was looking at me.

23:02.542 --> 23:05.041
And then it just started
to pulse blood.

23:05.125 --> 23:07.375
It was just...

23:07.458 --> 23:12.166
pulsing and pulsing
and pulsing.

23:19.417 --> 23:22.041

about my story.

23:52.959 --> 23:55.667

23:55.750 --> 23:56.917
CATHERINE:
Let us in.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.625

We had to stop for the dog.

23:58.709 --> 23:59.959

Ah, Jesus.

Oh.

24:06.625 --> 24:09.083
They're out of

you're gonna have

You want to fly down here

some weird guy today.

Mickey under his thumb.

26:12.625 --> 26:14.417
Uh, he had a moustache.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.208
Mickey said they were going
to Hollywood,

26:16.291 --> 26:18.834

an insurance salesman.

It's only fair.

28:59.083 --> 28:59.959

36:41.458 --> 36:42.250
What the fuck?
I want to pay him, Ray.

36:42.333 --> 36:45.083
I don't know what
that was for, Ray,

36:45.166 --> 36:45.917
but...

36:46.000 --> 36:48.291
Ray, Ray, I don't think

36:48.375 --> 36:49.417
we should do anything...

36:49.500 --> 36:51.208
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

36:53.083 --> 36:54.291
(yells)

36:54.375 --> 36:55.959
(groaning)
God!

36:56.041 --> 36:57.417
Oh, my God!

36:59.750 --> 37:01.083
Holy...

37:01.166 --> 37:02.959
You fucking psychopath!

37:03.041 --> 37:05.959
You ever go back on
a deal with me again,

37:06.041 --> 37:07.667
I'll fucking kill you.

37:10.166 --> 37:12.625
(Chip sobbing)

37:13.792 --> 37:17.041
Wow, Ray... wow.

37:19.834 --> 37:23.250
(humming)

37:27.875 --> 37:29.667
You're really enjoying yourself.

37:29.750 --> 37:31.834
(chuckles):
Well, Mickey,

37:31.917 --> 37:35.709
I know everyone must look

37:35.792 --> 37:39.000
like a hedonist to you,

37:39.083 --> 37:42.291
but the fact is, hey...

37:42.375 --> 37:42.834
I'm just doing my job.

37:42.917 --> 37:43.959
(chuckles)

37:44.041 --> 37:46.709
What's the beer for?

37:46.792 --> 37:50.875
Well...

37:50.959 --> 37:53.959
there is...

37:54.041 --> 37:56.750
nothing wrong with celebrating

37:56.834 --> 37:59.667
a victory.

37:59.750 --> 38:01.417
I guess I can't argue with that.

38:04.875 --> 38:07.250
(sighs)

38:07.333 --> 38:09.250
Frosty.

38:19.125 --> 38:21.291
SEAN: Mickey, you got
to be careful here.

38:21.375 --> 38:24.291
This movie that we are making
is-is fiction.

38:24.375 --> 38:25.417
(laughs)

38:25.500 --> 38:27.083
No one is really guilty
for that night.

38:27.166 --> 38:28.458
Accidents happen.

38:28.542 --> 38:30.375
MICKEY:
Accidents?

38:30.458 --> 38:32.834
You blew her fucking brains out.

38:32.917 --> 38:35.125
You ever think about that?

38:35.208 --> 38:38.458
SEAN (quietly):
No.

38:38.542 --> 38:41.542
I've worked all that out.

39:04.917 --> 39:06.542
Thanks, Ray.

39:06.625 --> 39:07.709
I had a great day.

39:07.792 --> 39:10.834
You take care of Conor tonight.

39:10.917 --> 39:11.667
Of course.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.709
That means not sharing
any of that

39:13.792 --> 39:15.333
sick shit you got running
around in your head.

39:15.417 --> 39:17.625
Yeah.

Hey, little dude,
you look slamming.
Hey.

Hi, Mrs. Donovan.

Abby.

39:26.917 --> 39:29.333
You look sharp.

39:29.417 --> 39:30.917

You'll never believe how
fucked up I was this morning.

Got to hand it to Ray.

We good now?

39:44.959 --> 39:46.959
You okay?

39:47.041 --> 39:48.041
Yeah, Dad.

39:48.125 --> 39:49.250
Thanks.

39:49.333 --> 39:51.250
Anything else

I'm still mad you hit Grandpa.

You really like
him, don't you?
Yeah, he's fun.

40:02.917 --> 40:06.333
He talks to me.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.583
All right.

40:10.500 --> 40:12.750
All right.

40:12.834 --> 40:14.834
You have fun tonight.

40:16.542 --> 40:17.625
I love you, Con.

40:22.083 --> 40:24.041
See you, Dad.

Let's go.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.458
All right.

See you.

40:30.750 --> 40:32.667
(crowd shouting, cheering)

40:34.792 --> 40:36.166
He stinks of booze,

40:36.250 --> 40:38.834
and he's wearing
a woman's shirt.

40:38.917 --> 40:40.667
Yeah.

40:40.750 --> 40:42.625
He'll be fine.

40:44.417 --> 40:46.083
Thank you.

40:47.208 --> 40:49.667
I'll see you at home?

40:49.750 --> 40:51.375
Yeah.

I got something I
got to take care of.

I'm doing it now.

41:41.083 --> 41:43.917
(phone chimes)

41:50.458 --> 41:52.542
Hey, you guys?

41:53.291 --> 41:55.792
Hi. So, I just got word

41:55.875 --> 41:57.208
from the New York office,
and they think you have

41:57.291 --> 41:59.542
a lot of potential,

41:59.625 --> 42:00.083
but I'm afraid
they already found someone.

42:00.166 --> 42:03.166
All right.

42:03.250 --> 42:04.208
Well, we had to wait
five hours for that?

42:04.291 --> 42:06.750
I'm sorry. I am.

42:06.834 --> 42:08.834
But I am gonna keep
your pictures on file, okay?

42:10.000 --> 42:14.083
(sighs)

42:14.166 --> 42:14.875
(quietly):
It's all right.

42:14.959 --> 42:16.041
Let's just...
let's just go.

42:16.125 --> 42:18.000
(Avi sighs)

42:18.083 --> 42:19.041
What the hell is this?

42:19.125 --> 42:19.750
His name is Baby.

42:19.834 --> 42:21.917
I thought you might want him.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.959
No. No way. I hate poodles.

42:24.041 --> 42:26.291
Yeah, well, what am I
supposed to do with him?

42:28.125 --> 42:29.750
Uh...

42:29.834 --> 42:31.041
All right.

42:31.125 --> 42:32.500
Give it.

42:32.583 --> 42:35.500
Hey, uh, Tara?

42:35.583 --> 42:36.083
Want a dog?

42:36.166 --> 42:39.709
Mom, please?

42:42.667 --> 42:44.792
(knocking)

42:55.709 --> 42:57.375
I said to myself
on the drive,

42:57.458 --> 42:59.458
(chuckles)
if L.A. looks like this,

42:59.542 --> 43:01.458
I'll fucking kill myself,

43:01.542 --> 43:05.041
but now that I'm here,
it's nice.

43:05.125 --> 43:06.542
I got you a car.

43:06.625 --> 43:08.834
I got transportation covered.
Thanks.

43:08.917 --> 43:11.458
It's safer
if you drive yourself.

43:11.542 --> 43:14.041
(chuckles)

43:16.458 --> 43:18.667
Listen, Sully,

43:18.750 --> 43:21.166
if you need a gun or a car
in this town,

43:21.250 --> 43:23.583
I'm the guy you want
to get it for you.

43:25.750 --> 43:29.166
Hey, Ray,
just 'cause we got a deal

43:29.250 --> 43:31.208
doesn't mean
I'm your fucking employee.

43:31.291 --> 43:32.291
Cheers.

43:32.375 --> 43:34.375
Our deal was you came alone.

43:34.458 --> 43:36.917
Took care of that, didn't I?

43:37.000 --> 43:38.542
(sighs)

43:39.583 --> 43:42.000
Now, I'm doing
this thing my way,

43:42.083 --> 43:43.583
using my tools.

43:43.667 --> 43:45.458
(chuckles)
Come on.

43:48.417 --> 43:51.041
Fine.

43:51.125 --> 43:52.083
But I say when.

43:52.166 --> 43:55.000
(sighs)

44:00.000 --> 44:02.333
Okay.

44:02.417 --> 44:05.875
And another thing:
you take care of him afterwards.

44:05.959 --> 44:07.959
I don't want anyone
from my family finding him.

44:10.500 --> 44:12.583
So I'm thinking

44:12.667 --> 44:15.834
maybe Mickey just went
on a long trip,

44:15.917 --> 44:17.125
forgot to leave
a forwarding address.

44:17.208 --> 44:20.542
Now, when do I get

44:20.625 --> 44:22.083
the rest of my money,
my passports,

44:22.166 --> 44:23.250
and my ticket out of here?

44:23.333 --> 44:27.417
When the job is done.

44:30.125 --> 44:32.083
What's the matter, Raymond?

44:32.166 --> 44:33.875
You don't trust me?

44:40.166 --> 44:42.834
VAN: I've got it
all worked out.

44:47.083 --> 44:50.417
I even already know the judge,

44:50.500 --> 44:51.750
prosecutor that I want.

44:51.834 --> 44:56.583
And they think they can
put Ray away for life?

44:56.667 --> 44:58.375
Well, I haven't spoken to them
about it yet,

44:58.458 --> 44:59.208
but yes, I'm sure they can.

44:59.291 --> 45:02.625
Both are known

45:02.709 --> 45:05.250
for their punitive flourishes.

45:05.333 --> 45:09.875
Especially with people like him.

45:11.834 --> 45:12.959
So what does
your boss think?

45:16.166 --> 45:17.959
You think I trust that guy?
(chuckles)

45:21.542 --> 45:24.125
Mickey, there's a reason

45:24.208 --> 45:27.667
Ray has eluded us
all these years.

45:29.959 --> 45:32.083
Let me get this straight.

45:34.709 --> 45:37.959
No one else
knows about this?

45:41.583 --> 45:43.667
(laughs)

45:45.000 --> 45:48.542
I couldn't risk it.

45:48.625 --> 45:50.250
And you get all the credit.

45:50.333 --> 45:54.208
(laughs)

46:15.959 --> 46:18.166
(sighs)

46:18.250 --> 46:21.959
At the Bureau,

46:22.041 --> 46:23.792
lazy people are always

46:23.875 --> 46:27.166
sticking their names
on good work.

46:28.417 --> 46:31.000
Not this time.

46:37.959 --> 46:40.041
Who's got the stick now?

46:40.125 --> 46:42.000
Hmm?

46:46.000 --> 46:47.917
Who's got the stick now?
