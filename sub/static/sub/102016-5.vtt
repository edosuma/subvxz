09:36.659 --> 09:38.786
(clears throat)
Good morning.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.080
Now, before you kick my ass,

09:41.122 --> 09:44.166
I have another idea.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.045
Okay.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.422
Can I kick your ass now?

09:49.463 --> 09:50.840
Not until you hear me out.

09:50.881 --> 09:53.551
This is the therapy box.
It creates scenarios.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.386
Trust me, I know.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.846
The last time
I was forced to use it,

09:56.887 --> 09:58.306
it turned me
into a brassy barmaid

09:58.347 --> 09:59.765
and made me realize

09:59.807 --> 10:01.642
my relationship
with Landon was doomed.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.185
Meaning it wasn't wrong.

10:03.227 --> 10:06.022
We're un-dooming things,
remember?

10:06.063 --> 10:07.565
I called Professor Vardemus.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.733
He said there's
a single user setting.

10:08.774 --> 10:09.859
Great, so then

10:09.900 --> 10:11.777
I'll just be lonely and annoyed.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.821
The group setting created
a simulation designed

10:13.863 --> 10:16.365
to resolve what everyone's
subconscious was dealing with.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.867
But if it's just you in there,

10:17.908 --> 10:20.119
it should create one
to deal with

10:20.161 --> 10:21.495
your specific problem.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.788
How to get Landon back.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.248
You're giving

10:24.290 --> 10:25.791
my subconscious
an awful lot of credit.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.418
Or maybe I'm just desperate.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.837
Whatever it takes,
right?

10:37.303 --> 10:39.096
(creaks)

10:40.723 --> 10:42.808
Ready, player one.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.568
(groans)

10:52.610 --> 10:55.029
(wind whistling)

11:00.951 --> 11:03.537
LIZZIE:
So, how was it?

11:03.579 --> 11:05.748
Ugh, my head.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.750
How was what?

11:07.792 --> 11:10.211
Looks like somebody had
a little bit too much to drink.

11:10.252 --> 11:12.588
I'll get you some water,
as soon as you tell me

11:12.630 --> 11:15.508
all about porking Landon.

11:15.549 --> 11:16.634
I don't know where to start.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.177
Hey, it's okay.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.262
First times, worst times,
am I right?

11:20.304 --> 11:22.848
But you are the one
who chose to punch her V-card

11:22.890 --> 11:26.018
in the creepy-ass cabin of the
Mystic Falls maintenance man.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.978
So own it.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.564
Did you know that the locals
think he haunts this place?

11:30.606 --> 11:32.858
He drowned in Salvatore Lake,
like, years ago,

11:32.900 --> 11:34.860
but they say that
you can still hear him

11:34.902 --> 11:38.406
in the woods at night,
clinking his tools.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.658
Lizzie, stop. You're scaring me.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.118
All right, well,

11:42.159 --> 11:44.036
then we should
change the subject.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.871
(whispers):
Back to you and Landon.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.415
I, um...

11:47.456 --> 11:51.794
I don't remember anything
about tonight.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.629
Of course not.

11:53.671 --> 11:58.008
Because Hope Mikaelson is so
sweet and smart and sensible.

11:58.050 --> 12:02.263
And she would never make
a mistake like Lizzie Saltzman

12:02.304 --> 12:04.932
and risk losing
her Best Babysitter License.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.225
Here's your bra.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.060
Uh...

12:08.102 --> 12:10.104
Wait a sec--
why did we come to the lake?

12:10.146 --> 12:11.397
Ask Landon.
He's probably off somewhere

12:11.439 --> 12:14.233
writing a song
about banging you.

12:15.609 --> 12:18.237
The next time that you decide
to get amnesia,

12:18.279 --> 12:20.030
just remember
that my sister dated him,

12:20.072 --> 12:22.032
and she has feelings, too.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.701
And it would totally
gut her to know

12:23.743 --> 12:25.661
that this meant nothing to you.
(gasps)

12:36.547 --> 12:38.591
(screams)

12:47.266 --> 12:50.144
(grunts, shouts)

12:57.902 --> 12:59.278
(wind whistling)

13:00.821 --> 13:02.865
MG:
Look at all this destruction.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.910
It's like a bomb
went off in Mystic Falls.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.578
A Malibomb.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.206
They call these things
prison worlds for a reason.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.708
Malivore's probably
trying to find a way out.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.879
I thought we were done
with that guy, thing, whatever.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.380
Or maybe he's just lonely,

13:18.422 --> 13:20.633
so he spends his days
puking up monsters.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.051
(clattering)

13:22.092 --> 13:23.052
Ooh.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.137
(snarling)

13:26.222 --> 13:28.182
(shrieks)
Relax.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.184
We're astral
projecting. Remember?

13:30.226 --> 13:31.602
It can't see,

13:31.644 --> 13:33.354
touch or hurt us.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.357
(screeches)

13:38.484 --> 13:40.069
Then let's just, uh,

13:40.110 --> 13:42.071
forget that I made that sound.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.989
You know what I'd
like to forget about?

13:44.031 --> 13:46.158
You and Alyssa Chang.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.993
But we never really
talked about that.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.453
How's it going?

13:49.495 --> 13:50.871
Cool.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.039
It's-it's-it's cool.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.041
We're cool.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.044
Well, it wasn't cool of her
to destroy the ascendant

13:57.086 --> 14:00.005
that we used to make this
world without telling anyone.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.758
I don't really want
to get into any of that.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.343
So if we
could get on

14:04.385 --> 14:05.928
with looking for Landon?

14:05.970 --> 14:08.222
Oh, that's not why
I brought you here.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.307
Then why did you?
One, because I needed

14:10.349 --> 14:11.976
a supernatural source to siphon

14:12.017 --> 14:13.727
to power
the astral projection spell.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.771
And two, what we're
really trying to find

14:15.813 --> 14:19.942
is a way to convince Josie
to stay at the Salvatore School.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.028
(buzzes)

14:23.070 --> 14:24.738
FINCH (over intercom):
Can I help you?

14:24.780 --> 14:27.491
Hi. My name is Josette Saltzman.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.243
I'm here
for the orientation tour.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.245
I'll be right out.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.664
Actually, there's no need.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.709
I'm dealing with, um,
a family emergency,

14:36.750 --> 14:38.252
so there's been
a change of plans

14:38.294 --> 14:40.462
and I won't be attending classes
here after all.

14:40.504 --> 14:41.881
(rapid footsteps)

14:41.922 --> 14:43.215
Ethan?

14:44.592 --> 14:45.968
Josie Saltzman.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.511
I guess we should
probably know

14:47.553 --> 14:48.804
each other better by now.
I mean,

14:48.846 --> 14:50.389
your dad was dating my mom

14:50.431 --> 14:52.349
and my sister had
that huge crush on you.

14:53.809 --> 14:58.355
But not so huge
that you noticed. Sweet.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.900
(laughs softly)
Water under the bridge, right?

15:00.941 --> 15:02.401
I heard your family left town.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.986
They did. I would
have gone with,

15:04.028 --> 15:06.697
but the town they moved
to already has a QB1.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.074
Oh, so you're quarterback here?
That's great.
It will be,

15:09.116 --> 15:11.410
once I beat out the guy
Coach thinks is gonna start.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.912
(door squeaks)

15:14.163 --> 15:15.915
I got to go, Jo.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.548
Name's Finch.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.717
I'm Jo...
Josette Saltzman.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.594
You told me.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.721
Ready for that tour?

15:35.935 --> 15:38.020
(footsteps approaching)

15:40.731 --> 15:42.066
ETHAN:
Let me help.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.112
I'm Ethan.
I know.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.949
You're the quarterback, rebel.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.034
Dirt bike rider.
Everybody knows.

15:52.076 --> 15:55.621
Well, in that case, it's nice to
meet you, too, Hope Mikaelson.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.498
How do you know my n...?
Okay, it doesn't matter.

15:57.539 --> 15:59.833
Point is, is that you can't be
out here, alone in the woods,

15:59.875 --> 16:01.460
doing hot guy stuff.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.253
It's just not safe.
Uh,

16:03.295 --> 16:05.506
let me guess. The Mystic Falls
maintenance man?

16:05.547 --> 16:07.132
Mm-hmm.
Sorry,

16:07.174 --> 16:09.426
but I just finished
pitching my tent,

16:09.468 --> 16:11.220
so I'll take my chances.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.931
He's real, Ethan.
He just killed Lizzie Saltzman.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.391
I need to find Landon.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.935
(chuckles) So you're still
with that guy?

16:17.977 --> 16:20.062
That's your takeaway?
Of course I am.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.605
Why wouldn't I be?
Because dating

16:21.647 --> 16:23.691
is like a passing play.

16:23.732 --> 16:26.443
Hope, you have options.
And sometimes

16:26.485 --> 16:30.864
the best one is standing right
in front of you, wide open.

16:30.906 --> 16:33.158
Okay, there is no time for me
to even attempt

16:33.200 --> 16:34.576
parsing a football metaphor
right now, okay?

16:34.618 --> 16:36.245
You need to go.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.080
Well, so do you, because
I just saw Landon at the dock

16:38.122 --> 16:39.289
with Lizzie's sister.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.041
What were they doing?

Who cares about that?
There's a killer on the loose.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.425
Yes, the maintenance man.
Have you seen him?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.052
It was hard to miss him when
he tried slicing me in half,

18:15.094 --> 18:17.262
but Landon saved me,
but now he's hurt.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.848

Oh, my God. Where is he?

18:19.890 --> 18:21.350
He went to the Salvatore Lodge.

18:21.391 --> 18:22.976
He went to go find a phone

Okay, get to

Get help.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.281
Come with me.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.741
I can't.

Have you tried
telling her

of emotional
terrorism.

19:38.552 --> 19:41.013
Not that she's even noticed.
So that's,

19:41.054 --> 19:42.472
that's a no.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.474
It's semantics, okay?

You're supposed

Josie that I am right

and she needs to stay
at the Salvatore School with me.

Why do you think everything

Well, she can

20:42.282 --> 20:44.201
What you're after
means a lot to me.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.204
You see, that's what I don't
understand.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.789
You were just aware
of this artifact recently.

20:48.830 --> 20:52.251
And yet here you
are, wanting it.

20:52.292 --> 20:54.211
Oh, I've got my reasons.
Me, too.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.004
Because ever since I got
my hands on that thing,

20:56.046 --> 20:58.048
I've been having these dreams.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.841
And I'm not the kind of guy
that does that.

20:59.883 --> 21:01.885
I know it must
sound crazy to you.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.972
Oh, my bar for crazy
is set pretty high.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.474
I know these dreams
are gonna come true.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.726
Like you said, that artifact's
gonna grant my heart's

21:09.768 --> 21:11.478
most impossible desire.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.313
If I could just figure out
how to open the damn thing.

21:13.355 --> 21:16.483
Well, let me take a look at it.
Maybe I can help.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.735
Thanks for the offer.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.946
Now take your bat and go.

21:24.783 --> 21:27.869
It's not the Bambino's,
but it's priceless to me.

21:27.911 --> 21:32.124
I played in a wooden bat
league, summers, high school,

21:32.165 --> 21:34.418
and the thing never broke,

21:34.459 --> 21:36.420
no matter how hard
I'd smash things.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.547
And I have
been doing

21:38.588 --> 21:42.259
a lot of smashing
over the years since.

21:43.385 --> 21:46.763
You also stopped that little
witch from killing me, so...

21:46.805 --> 21:49.182
I'm betting you've gone softer
than you think.

21:49.224 --> 21:52.644
That little witch
has lost more in her life

21:52.686 --> 21:54.396
than almost
anyone I know.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.816
And I'm here to help her get
her heart's desire.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.320
Trust me when I say

22:01.361 --> 22:04.573
I am well aware
of the line I'm about to cross.

22:05.907 --> 22:08.493
Now, give me the artifact.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.787
It doesn't have to go like this.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.873
Well, in my experience...

22:12.914 --> 22:14.499
it does.

22:14.541 --> 22:16.460
Now...

22:16.501 --> 22:18.253
you're gonna get this bat

22:18.295 --> 22:21.715
one way or the other.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.926
It's your call, Pinky.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.692
(metallic creaking)

22:49.034 --> 22:51.119
(door creaking)

22:57.876 --> 22:59.461
(gasps)

22:59.503 --> 23:00.962
Jed, where's Landon?

23:01.004 --> 23:03.006
(gagging)

23:06.593 --> 23:08.929
LANDON:
Hope, is that you?
Landon?

23:08.970 --> 23:10.972
Hold on, I'm coming.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.572
LANDON:
Hope! Help!

23:33.245 --> 23:34.746
Landon?

23:41.711 --> 23:43.130
(weak gasping)

23:43.171 --> 23:44.631
Dr. Saltzman.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.300
What-what do I do?

23:47.342 --> 23:48.885
Hope...

23:49.803 --> 23:51.179
Landon's...
(loud bang)

23:55.851 --> 23:57.978
I'm through running.

23:58.019 --> 24:00.355
(banging on door)

24:02.941 --> 24:04.818
You've killed all my friends.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.112
Everyone I love
is dead.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.572
So you won.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.078
(grunting)

24:31.845 --> 24:35.015
Correction: I win.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.233
(whispers):
Landon.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.863
(gasping)

24:52.574 --> 24:54.826
(exhales):
Ooh...

24:56.953 --> 24:58.872
(grunts)

24:58.914 --> 25:00.499
Whew.

25:00.540 --> 25:03.502
Now, that is the Hope
Mikaelson I know and love.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.378
What the hell is happening?
What, you still

25:05.420 --> 25:07.881
haven't figured it out?

25:13.720 --> 25:15.805
I don't understand.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.476
Come with me.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.687
I can help.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.784
(low growl)

25:35.825 --> 25:38.870
You're a hard man to find.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.498
I've been on the move.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.124
I've been vamping
all over town,

25:43.166 --> 25:44.417
searching for Landon.

25:44.459 --> 25:45.585
No luck.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.087
Same.

25:47.128 --> 25:49.089
Not even a chest hair.

25:49.130 --> 25:51.174
I thought you weren't looking.

25:52.133 --> 25:55.220
And I thought about
that question you asked me.

25:55.262 --> 25:57.305
You were right.

25:57.347 --> 25:58.807
If I want Josie to stay,

25:58.848 --> 26:01.434
I just need to come out
and say it.

26:01.476 --> 26:03.603
But you don't want to.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.897
Oh, I totally want to.

26:05.939 --> 26:08.900
It's just that
she wants something else.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.903
And maybe I have

26:11.945 --> 26:13.905
finally realized
that her happiness

26:13.947 --> 26:16.992
is just as important as mine is.

26:17.033 --> 26:20.287
So you're cool with Jo going
to Mystic Falls?

26:21.663 --> 26:24.291
I realized something else, too.

26:24.332 --> 26:26.334
The reason
I wanted you here,

26:26.376 --> 26:30.088
the reason I snapped at you...

26:30.130 --> 26:32.465
it wasn't about Josie.

26:32.507 --> 26:34.301
It was about...

26:34.342 --> 26:36.720
what Alyssa swooped in and did,

26:36.761 --> 26:40.724
before I worked up
the courage to stop her.

26:44.644 --> 26:47.564
Destroying the ascendant.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.650
(laughs softly)

26:52.611 --> 26:54.321
Sure.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.408
Enjoy your pool party.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.909
Remeo.

26:59.951 --> 27:02.162
(takes deep breath)

27:06.499 --> 27:08.585
♪ ♪

27:26.311 --> 27:28.271
You look pretty.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.398
A lot less bloody, at least.

27:32.025 --> 27:34.110
(sighs)

27:34.152 --> 27:36.821
As much as I'd like
to stare into those eyes
of yours all night,

27:36.863 --> 27:39.407
we should probably talk
about the fact that I killed you

27:39.449 --> 27:41.201
and you're still here.

27:41.242 --> 27:42.911
You're right.

27:42.952 --> 27:45.288
What really matters is
what happened to your friends.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.706
You murdered them,

27:46.748 --> 27:48.750
then they disappeared.
So will I,

27:48.792 --> 27:51.670
once you realize
that this is all a game.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.881
But what it's
trying to teach you

27:54.923 --> 27:56.758
is very real.

27:57.717 --> 28:00.470
The therapy box.

28:00.512 --> 28:04.015
Bigger than it looks
on the outside, right?

28:04.057 --> 28:05.975
Like you said,

28:06.017 --> 28:08.728
your friends died
in the scenario it created.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.063
So...

28:10.105 --> 28:12.023
what do you think that means?

28:12.065 --> 28:14.275
I think this game's stupid.

28:14.317 --> 28:15.902
Yeah.

28:18.279 --> 28:20.281
And that I couldn't save them.

28:20.323 --> 28:21.491
Mm-hmm.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.535
Why not?

28:23.576 --> 28:25.620
Be honest.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.914
Because all I cared about
was saving you.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.499
Well, you know,

28:29.541 --> 28:32.502
death can be a metaphor
sometimes but not always.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.003
What is that supposed to mean?

28:34.045 --> 28:35.463
It's your game. You tell me.

28:35.505 --> 28:36.673
I don't know.
Yes, you do.
Deep down.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.133
What do you want me to say?

28:38.174 --> 28:39.801
That I should be happy
everyone's waiting

28:39.843 --> 28:41.761
outside of this box
for me except for you?

28:41.803 --> 28:44.472
That the reason why
I can't find or-or kill you

28:44.514 --> 28:46.933
in this stupid game
is because you're already dead?

28:46.975 --> 28:48.935
That I should just...
give up on you?

28:48.977 --> 28:50.311
No.

28:50.353 --> 28:53.481
That is what I need you
to believe.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.900
Because as much
as we both wish it weren't...

28:56.901 --> 28:58.570
...it's the truth.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.074
Don't talk to me like that.
Like what?

29:03.116 --> 29:04.743
Like you're real.

29:04.784 --> 29:06.870
Like you're him.
But that's the
whole point:

29:06.911 --> 29:08.663
to help you understand...
Understand this:

29:08.705 --> 29:10.206
you are not him.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.375
Landon would never want me
to give up on him.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.377
Are you sure?
If I'm in this therapy box,
shouldn't I have gotten

29:14.419 --> 29:16.546
an escape word
once I had my breakthrough?

29:16.588 --> 29:19.466
Right? Where the hell is it?
It won't show up until
you actually accept

29:19.507 --> 29:21.134
what I'm
telling you.
Not gonna happen.

29:22.260 --> 29:25.013
What are you doing?

29:25.054 --> 29:27.140
Let me go.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.893
You first.

29:31.352 --> 29:33.438
You watched me dissolve.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.856
You know being
a Tribrid

29:34.898 --> 29:37.108
makes you and your blood
toxic to Malivore.

29:37.150 --> 29:40.487
That I'm his biological son.

29:40.528 --> 29:42.530
So, deep down...

29:45.366 --> 29:48.203
...what do you
really think happened to me?

29:50.789 --> 29:52.540
(flames whooshing)

29:58.755 --> 30:00.965
I don't want to say it.

30:01.007 --> 30:02.675
(whispers):
I know.

30:02.717 --> 30:05.804
We can say it together,
if that helps.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.891
On three.

30:09.933 --> 30:12.018
One.

30:13.686 --> 30:15.355
Two.

30:17.106 --> 30:19.067
Three.

30:24.155 --> 30:25.990
I can barely hear you.
Where-where are you, the moon?

30:26.032 --> 30:27.659
KALEB:
Moon doesn't have a pool, MG.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.619
I just pulled up to the spot.
Where's your skinny ass?

30:29.661 --> 30:31.120
I'm running late.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.497
I got sidetracked with
Lizzie and Landon stuff.

30:32.539 --> 30:34.040
All right, man,
well, get a move on.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.708
I'm gonna fire up the grill.
(door opens)

30:35.750 --> 30:37.126
What...?

30:38.086 --> 30:40.004
(quietly):
Jed?

30:40.046 --> 30:42.090
Oh.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.178
Oh. Oh, damn. Um...

30:47.220 --> 30:48.847
uh, hey,

30:48.888 --> 30:49.973
on second thought, you...

30:50.014 --> 30:51.224
stay where
you are, um...

30:51.266 --> 30:53.142
ALYSSA:
Jed? Sweetie? I'm hungry.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.812
Oh, God. The party's over.

30:56.771 --> 30:59.065
FINCH:
And that concludes our tour.

30:59.107 --> 31:02.485
Thank you. This place seems
perfect for me right now.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.612
I'm surprised
you even noticed.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.948
You were staring at me
the whole time.
(laughs)

31:06.990 --> 31:09.576
Um, I was just listening
very intently.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.077
(laughs):
Got it.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.328
So, any questions?

31:12.370 --> 31:13.496
Uh, just one.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.874
But it's personal.

31:15.915 --> 31:17.375
Why did Ethan

31:17.417 --> 31:19.460
give you the stink eye
when he saw you earlier?

31:19.502 --> 31:21.963
Me and his sister dated
for a minute--

31:22.005 --> 31:23.882
like, a hot minute--
and...

31:23.923 --> 31:26.634
I didn't take the news that
she was leaving town too well,

31:26.676 --> 31:28.887
which is why
I'm on suspension,

31:28.928 --> 31:31.890
giving tours
and wiping chalkboards.

31:31.931 --> 31:33.600
It's a long story.

31:33.641 --> 31:36.102
You can tell me
all about it at lunch.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.897
If I'm cool enough to sit
at your table. (chuckles)

31:38.938 --> 31:40.565
Not gonna happen.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.108
I'm perceptive, too.
I heard what you said earlier.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.735
You're not gonna go here.

31:43.776 --> 31:47.322
My sister took the news
about me wanting to transfer

31:47.363 --> 31:51.034
about as well as you
did Maya leaving.

31:51.075 --> 31:52.869
Then why'd you take the tour?

31:52.911 --> 31:54.871
Because I wanted to.

31:54.913 --> 31:58.166
I did it for me,
and it felt right.

31:59.459 --> 32:01.252
And I really do
want to come here.

32:01.294 --> 32:04.631
If I can

32:04.672 --> 32:06.716
sit at your table.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.219
That a metaphor or something?

32:10.261 --> 32:12.347
Hmm, what do you think?

32:14.057 --> 32:15.767
I'll tell you at lunch.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.354
If you ever come back.

32:25.818 --> 32:27.695
(sighs)

32:30.990 --> 32:32.158
What are you doing?

32:32.200 --> 32:33.785
Oh, you know, just tidying up.

32:33.826 --> 32:36.204
Hope, you said it yourself,

32:36.245 --> 32:37.956
this place isn't real.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.707
You can't stay here.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.084
Well, not like this,
but with a little

32:41.125 --> 32:42.085
imaginary paint
and elbow grease...

32:42.126 --> 32:44.087
You're in denial.
I'm not.

32:44.128 --> 32:46.047
See?
I don't care.

32:46.089 --> 32:48.174
Not if it means I
get to be with you.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.759
Or at least
close enough.

32:49.801 --> 32:50.927
But what about
your friends?

32:50.969 --> 32:52.303
You saw what happened to them.

32:52.345 --> 32:53.596
This is all
just a metaphor.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.056
Right? (chuckles)

32:55.098 --> 32:56.599
I mean, me being powerless,
you haunting me,

32:56.641 --> 32:58.518
them being in trouble.

32:58.559 --> 33:00.728
So, for once in my life, I am
not gonna sacrifice what I love

33:00.770 --> 33:02.522
to metaphorically save anyone.

33:02.563 --> 33:04.857
Yeah, no offense,
but that's kind of what you do.

33:04.899 --> 33:07.026
Not this time.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.569
So that stupid word
can keep appearing,

33:08.611 --> 33:10.029
but I'm not leaving.

33:10.071 --> 33:13.241
(whooshing)

33:13.282 --> 33:14.909
I didn't say the word.

33:14.951 --> 33:16.536
Why am I here?

33:16.577 --> 33:18.454
Well, in layman's terms,
I unplugged the damn thing.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.206
Which Vardemus
assured me was safe

33:20.248 --> 33:21.499
to do with a single user.

33:21.541 --> 33:22.750
Maybe he was wrong.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.085
No, maybe you were.

33:26.254 --> 33:28.881
Hope. What happened in there?
You should know,

33:28.923 --> 33:30.800
since this was your plan
all along.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.385
You didn't put me in that box
to find Landon,

33:32.427 --> 33:35.304
you put me in it
Mittent.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.850
(groaning)

33:38.891 --> 33:40.435
If that were true,

33:40.476 --> 33:41.811
why would I pull you out?

33:41.853 --> 33:43.187
(groans)

33:45.440 --> 33:47.692
Let me show you something.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.530
(grunts)

33:52.572 --> 33:54.532
Is that the artifact
we were looking for?

33:54.574 --> 33:56.492
How did you find that?

33:56.534 --> 33:58.244
(chuckles softly)

33:58.286 --> 33:59.537
(groans)

34:00.997 --> 34:03.708
By being
wildly irresponsible.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.293
We'll have to do some research,

34:05.334 --> 34:07.170
figure out
how to use the damn thing.

34:07.211 --> 34:10.423
Or better plan: I make a wish,
pop it open, see what happens.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.300
Can't.
You reek of blood.

34:12.341 --> 34:14.886
Don't tell me that you're gonna
start being responsible now.

34:14.927 --> 34:16.929
I've tried to open it.
It's locked.

34:16.971 --> 34:18.848
Probably spelled shut.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.642
(whirring)

34:25.772 --> 34:26.898
Go ahead,

34:26.939 --> 34:28.232
make your wish.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.867
Uh, why are
we out here?
(laughs)

34:37.909 --> 34:41.245
She may not look like much
on the outside, but...

34:41.287 --> 34:43.414
(hinges squeak)

34:43.456 --> 34:45.583
...baby's got it
where it counts.

34:49.128 --> 34:50.505
Here.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.591
I don't really
drink like that.

34:53.633 --> 34:55.593
And I just saw Jed naked.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.136
Make the exception.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.596
Okay.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.098
(both laugh)

35:00.139 --> 35:01.390
(sighs)

35:01.432 --> 35:03.226
(groans)

35:03.267 --> 35:05.103
(exhales)

35:05.144 --> 35:07.188
I know it's not exactly the
party you were planning, but...

35:07.230 --> 35:08.940
(chuckles)

35:08.981 --> 35:11.109
(sighs)

35:11.150 --> 35:14.112
I feel so stupid.

35:14.153 --> 35:15.446
How did I think dating

35:15.488 --> 35:17.532
Maleficent...
(laughs)

35:17.573 --> 35:19.367
was gonna end well?

35:19.408 --> 35:22.620
It's that gentle heart of yours.

35:22.662 --> 35:23.788
And this one...

35:23.830 --> 35:26.541
is as much on me
as it is on you.

35:26.582 --> 35:29.001
I would love to hear that math.

35:29.043 --> 35:30.711
(opens bottle)

35:30.753 --> 35:34.173
I made a promise to you,
once upon a time,

35:34.215 --> 35:35.967
that if anyone wanted
to come at you,

35:36.008 --> 35:38.010
they had to go through me.

35:38.052 --> 35:40.596
And I wasn't around.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.390
Mm, but you were only gone

35:42.431 --> 35:44.767
'cause you were trying
to help Hope and Dr. Saltzman.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.769
And there's no point, okay?

35:46.811 --> 35:49.188
I know it's an unpopular opinion
around these parts,

35:49.230 --> 35:51.774
but Landon is...

35:51.816 --> 35:53.484
(sighs)

35:53.526 --> 35:55.570
Landon's gone, bro.

35:55.611 --> 35:56.946
And he
ain't coming back.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.489
So I should've been here,

35:58.531 --> 36:00.491
worrying about things
I can actually change,

36:00.533 --> 36:03.035
instead of...
(sighs)

36:03.077 --> 36:04.787
But you don't know that.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.455
Okay, did you and Lizzie
find Landon

36:06.497 --> 36:07.999
in that prison world or not?

36:10.293 --> 36:11.627
No.

36:13.212 --> 36:16.257
But I did stand up to her.

36:16.299 --> 36:18.134
You... you...
For myself.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.510
You did? You?

36:19.552 --> 36:22.430
(laughs):
Yeah, i-in a gentlemanly way.

36:23.598 --> 36:25.766
How'd that go?

36:25.808 --> 36:28.686
Way better than I expected.
(laughs)

36:29.645 --> 36:32.148
That's cool, man.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.317
Just promise me
you'll keep that up,

36:34.358 --> 36:37.153
instead of going along with it
whenever you feel you need to.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.573
You know, like, when Jed's
trying to get at your girl.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.534
I will.

36:43.576 --> 36:47.288
As long as you promise me
you won't give up on Landon.

36:47.330 --> 36:50.333
Man...
More than promise.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.210
I'm-I'm talking, like, a...

36:52.251 --> 36:54.253
a vow.
(chuckles)

36:58.257 --> 37:00.676
So I say yes

37:00.718 --> 37:03.429

It's a Grecian urn.
It was stolen out of a museum
