00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:07.048 --> 00:08.799
Well, congratulations, guys,

00:08.799 --> 00:10.931
that was our
tenth mission this week.

00:10.931 --> 00:12.933
Only ten?

00:12.933 --> 00:14.805
It feels more
like a hundred.

00:14.805 --> 00:16.727
Using superpowers
really takes it out of you.

00:16.727 --> 00:19.560
My whole
body's sore. (groans)

00:19.560 --> 00:20.811
Yeah, mine too.

00:20.811 --> 00:22.443
( groans in pain )

00:22.443 --> 00:24.985
Oh, it hurts more to sit!

00:24.985 --> 00:28.779
OK, you guys
haven't even had
your powers that long,

00:28.779 --> 00:29.950
and you're
already complaining.

00:29.950 --> 00:31.952
Yeah, um,
I have been running

00:31.952 --> 00:34.245
hundreds of miles an hour
since I was a baby.

00:34.245 --> 00:36.117
Don't you talk to me
about sore

00:36.117 --> 00:38.329
until you have
bionic blisters.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.750
( boys recoil )

00:42.543 --> 00:43.544
Rookies.

00:45.216 --> 00:46.167
Ow!

00:46.167 --> 00:49.009
BREE: Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:49.009 --> 00:51.262
Man, if we feel
this bad now,

00:51.262 --> 00:52.973
what's gonna happen
when we get older?

00:52.973 --> 00:54.435
I don't know.

00:54.435 --> 00:56.977
Ooh! But I can show you
what we'll look like.

00:56.977 --> 00:59.890
Yeah, I have this app
that ages photos.

00:59.890 --> 01:00.941
( shutter clicks )

01:00.941 --> 01:02.983
That is you at 80.

01:02.983 --> 01:04.445
Ugh!

01:05.816 --> 01:07.898
( chuckles )
Cute mustache.

01:07.898 --> 01:09.400
Mustache?

01:09.400 --> 01:12.493
Yeah, that's all nose hair.

01:12.493 --> 01:15.866
Guys, why are you
so freaked out about
growing older, anyway?

01:15.866 --> 01:17.698
It's just a part of life.

01:17.698 --> 01:20.501
Personally,
I am looking forward
to aging gracefully.

01:20.501 --> 01:21.872
Oh, really?

01:21.872 --> 01:22.873
Hmm.

01:22.873 --> 01:25.416
'Cause this is you.
( shutter clicks )

01:28.669 --> 01:30.010
So? Big deal.

01:30.010 --> 01:31.712
That's what everybody
looks like when they're 80.

01:32.973 --> 01:34.715
Dude, that's you at 40.

01:34.715 --> 01:36.177
What! Gimme!

01:38.389 --> 01:40.060
Yeah. You're gonna need
a new phone

01:40.060 --> 01:41.642
'cause this one just broke.

01:43.814 --> 01:45.726
( theme song playing )

02:26.567 --> 02:30.481
( groaning )

02:31.902 --> 02:34.074
( both boys groaning )

02:34.074 --> 02:36.116
Just so you know,

02:36.116 --> 02:39.540
nothing about this picture
says "superhero."

02:41.242 --> 02:43.494
Hey, guys. Guess what?

02:43.494 --> 02:45.085
Tasha and my baby sister
are coming to visit.

02:45.085 --> 02:46.707
Oh, great!

02:46.707 --> 02:47.958
We finally get to meet
the woman

02:47.958 --> 02:49.960
that has to spend
every waking moment

02:49.960 --> 02:51.091
with Mr. Davenport.

02:51.091 --> 02:52.923
Never mind us.
She's the real hero.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.468
Where have you been?

02:57.468 --> 02:59.350
Fighting Father Time.

02:59.350 --> 03:01.892
Have you seen
what I look like
on Kaz's app?

03:01.892 --> 03:03.063
I'm trying to
create a device

03:03.063 --> 03:04.645
to reverse
the aging process.

03:04.645 --> 03:05.896
I've been up all night

03:05.896 --> 03:08.108
splitting molecules
and splicing DNA.

03:08.108 --> 03:09.900
Wow, Chase,
only you can make

03:09.900 --> 03:11.982
the phrase
"up all night"
sound boring.

03:14.365 --> 03:15.616
Hey, guys!

03:15.616 --> 03:18.078
Hey!
There she is!
Hey!

03:18.078 --> 03:21.081
Guys, this is
my little sister, Naomi.
Oh, hi, Naomi.

03:21.081 --> 03:23.744
( all speaking in baby talk )
SKYLAR: Oh, my goodness.

03:23.744 --> 03:25.205
( clears throat )
So cute!

03:25.205 --> 03:26.627
Oh, uh, right,

03:26.627 --> 03:27.998
and this is, uh,
Naomi's mom. ( chuckles )

03:29.960 --> 03:31.962
Aw, she's so cute!
( Tasha chuckling )

03:31.962 --> 03:33.754
Too bad it won't last.

03:33.754 --> 03:35.045
It's only a matter of time
before she looks like

03:35.045 --> 03:37.137
a wrinkly, old,
hairless goblin!

03:40.050 --> 03:41.342
Good to see you, Tasha.

03:42.933 --> 03:44.645
So, uh,

03:44.645 --> 03:46.727
what's it like having
a baby in the house?

03:46.727 --> 03:49.149
I mean, other than
Mr. Davenport.

03:49.149 --> 03:51.021
I love it!

03:51.021 --> 03:52.853
It's just with Donald
working so much,

03:52.853 --> 03:54.735
it's hard to find
time for myself.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.197
I don't suppose
you guys would wanna
watch her for a bit?

03:57.197 --> 03:58.989
Uh, sorry.
No can do.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.781
Babies freak me out.

04:00.781 --> 04:02.202
I mean, those things
don't even have kneecaps,

04:02.202 --> 04:03.864
and I don't trust
anything without kneecaps.

04:05.826 --> 04:08.078
Oh, you don't want me
near your kid. ( chuckles )

04:08.078 --> 04:10.040
I can barely take care
of myself. ( laughs )

04:12.042 --> 04:13.424
I'd love to watch her.

04:13.424 --> 04:15.836
Really? Thank you, Skylar.

04:15.836 --> 04:18.178
Uh, no, it's--
It's OK.

04:18.178 --> 04:20.971
I-I'm Naomi's big sister,
so I'll watch her.

04:20.971 --> 04:22.052
Come here.

04:22.052 --> 04:24.685
( Naomi cries )

04:24.685 --> 04:27.308
That's weird.
She almost never cries.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.689
Here, let me try.

04:28.689 --> 04:30.311
( nervous chuckle )
OK.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.692
( Naomi stops crying )

04:31.692 --> 04:33.063
( cooing )

04:33.063 --> 04:34.695
That's weird.

04:34.695 --> 04:36.817
She almost never
takes to strangers.

04:36.817 --> 04:38.739
She's not taking
to strangers, OK?

04:38.739 --> 04:39.990
She's just
frightened into silence

04:39.990 --> 04:41.992
by her three
alien heartbeats.

04:44.955 --> 04:46.036
( Naomi starts crying )

04:46.036 --> 04:47.037
And she's crying again.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.248
OK, I know she's crying!

04:48.248 --> 04:50.501
She's a baby.
It's what they do!

04:50.501 --> 04:53.674
You know, I really
don't need to go out.

04:53.674 --> 04:56.006
I haven't had
a moment to myself
for eleven months,

04:56.006 --> 04:57.918
what's another day?

04:57.918 --> 04:59.630
Tasha, please, look,

04:59.630 --> 05:01.301
I can handle her.
Don't you trust me?

05:01.301 --> 05:03.514
Of course I do, Bree.

05:03.514 --> 05:05.055
Here you go.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.137
( Naomi stops crying )

05:09.139 --> 05:10.140
You can let go
of her now.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.562
Right.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.485
You're still
holding on to her.

05:14.485 --> 05:16.066
Am I?

05:16.066 --> 05:17.738
Yes.

05:17.738 --> 05:19.940
That's OK.
Oh! OK.

05:19.940 --> 05:22.903
( Bree laughs nervously )
Feel free to ask
the alien girl for help.

05:22.903 --> 05:25.075
( Naomi crying )

05:25.075 --> 05:26.747
That's just her
saying good-bye.

05:26.747 --> 05:27.748
It's OK.

05:32.663 --> 05:35.586
Hey, Chase,
you figured out a way
to reverse the aging process?

05:35.586 --> 05:37.127
No!

05:37.127 --> 05:39.960
So far I've only figured out
how to speed it up.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.672
How far did you go?

05:41.672 --> 05:42.923
You're looking
a little rough.

05:44.054 --> 05:46.136
I didn't use it on me!

05:46.136 --> 05:48.889
Yeah, Kaz,
that haggard face
is all natural.

05:51.141 --> 05:53.524
Watch. This is my problem.

05:55.315 --> 05:56.737
Right now,

05:56.737 --> 05:58.318
it's a perfectly ripe apple.

06:03.243 --> 06:06.246
And now it's been
aged 12 years.

06:06.246 --> 06:08.288
Hey, I like dried fruit.

06:08.288 --> 06:09.540
Maybe it gets better
with age.

06:09.540 --> 06:10.541
( soft chuckle )

06:12.252 --> 06:15.205
Yeah. It doesn't.

06:19.169 --> 06:20.461
( Naomi crying )

06:20.461 --> 06:23.133
Oh! Please don't cry. I--

06:23.133 --> 06:25.265
Ooh, what if I sing you
a nursery rhyme?

06:25.265 --> 06:26.887
I bet you'd like that, huh?

06:26.887 --> 06:30.681
Uh...Nursery rhyme.
Nursery rhyme, uh...

06:30.681 --> 06:32.563
♪ Look ,this is
a nursery rhyme ♪

06:32.563 --> 06:33.854
( Bree chuckles nervously )

06:33.854 --> 06:36.146
♪ You're having a good time ♪

06:36.146 --> 06:38.108
♪ Listening to
the nursery rhyme ♪

06:38.108 --> 06:40.190
( crying continues )

06:40.190 --> 06:42.192
Wow, you're good.

06:43.283 --> 06:44.575
Hey, I grew up
in a basement.

06:44.575 --> 06:46.026
The only nursery rhyme
I know

06:46.026 --> 06:47.828
is the buzzing
of a nuclear generator.

06:50.030 --> 06:53.203
Yeah? Well, I was
raised by a blob of lava
that didn't have a mouth,

06:53.203 --> 06:55.125
and even I know
"Twinkle, twinkle,
little star."

06:57.247 --> 07:00.170
Always gotta play
the alien card, don't you?

07:02.172 --> 07:04.134
She seems really upset.
Maybe I should hold her.

07:04.134 --> 07:05.255
No!
( crying continues )

07:05.255 --> 07:07.928
Fine. Then I guess
you got this.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.350
Yeah, I do.

07:10.350 --> 07:11.261
OK, then.

07:11.261 --> 07:12.262
All righty, then.

07:12.262 --> 07:13.604
Call me if you need me.

07:13.604 --> 07:15.726
Thanks, but I won't.

07:17.858 --> 07:18.859
( Naomi crying )

07:18.859 --> 07:21.401
OK, all right.

07:21.401 --> 07:24.735
It's just you and me
now, baby girl.

07:27.067 --> 07:28.829
Oh, maybe you're just hungry!

07:28.829 --> 07:29.830
Yes! OK.

07:29.830 --> 07:31.241
Um, oh!

07:31.241 --> 07:33.744
Look, it's
everybody's favorite,

07:33.744 --> 07:36.076
mushy green stuff.

07:36.076 --> 07:37.247
Ugh.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.711
All right, here you go.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.924
Yeah.
( laughs )

07:43.924 --> 07:45.385
( Naomi spits )
Oh!

07:48.178 --> 07:49.890
OK...

07:49.890 --> 07:52.092
( groans )
Guess you're not hungry.

07:54.304 --> 07:55.856
( crying continues )

07:55.856 --> 07:58.649
Um, OK, uh...

07:58.649 --> 08:00.651
Why don't I
go set you over there

08:00.651 --> 08:02.603
with your toys
while I get cleaned up, OK?

08:02.603 --> 08:05.566
( Naomi spits )
Oh! Oh!

08:05.566 --> 08:07.237
Ew!

08:07.237 --> 08:10.030
OK, that time
you were clearly
aiming for my face.

08:13.283 --> 08:14.284
Hmm.

08:14.284 --> 08:15.706
( Naomi crying feebly )

08:18.288 --> 08:20.290
( whispers )
OK, sit right there.

08:20.290 --> 08:21.752
( stops crying )

08:21.752 --> 08:23.293
( breathes deeply )

08:25.295 --> 08:27.678
♪ Twinkle, twinkle,
little star ♪

08:29.800 --> 08:31.131
( shrugs )
Yeah, I don't know it.

08:37.728 --> 08:38.769
No!

08:44.524 --> 08:46.356
( screams )
It's after me!

08:46.356 --> 08:48.909
I knew this would happen!

08:48.909 --> 08:50.861
How did she get
into the hyperlift?

08:52.322 --> 08:54.074
I don't know.

08:54.074 --> 08:56.657
She's doing a great job
at dusting the floor.

08:56.657 --> 08:58.118
( chuckles ) Look at her go!

09:00.000 --> 09:01.291
Yes, for a creature
without kneecaps,

09:01.291 --> 09:03.003
she is extremely agile.

09:05.626 --> 09:07.047
Well, don't just
stand there.
Pick her up.

09:08.378 --> 09:09.970
I don't know
how to pick up a baby.

09:09.970 --> 09:11.171
You do it.

09:11.171 --> 09:13.764
Oh, come on.
How hard can it be?

09:15.636 --> 09:16.677
( Naomi cooing )
OK...

09:16.677 --> 09:18.228
I just, uh...

09:19.770 --> 09:21.852
( Cooing )
( groans )

09:21.852 --> 09:23.523
Maybe it's
more like, uh...

09:23.523 --> 09:25.315
( Naomi whimpers )

09:27.988 --> 09:29.650
Yeah, I got nothin'.

09:29.650 --> 09:31.361
( cooing )

09:31.361 --> 09:34.454
Her giant baby eyes
are piercing through my soul!

09:34.454 --> 09:36.246
Make it stop!
Make it stop!

09:40.500 --> 09:41.501
KAZ: Hey...

09:41.501 --> 09:42.873
Oh, it's squishy!

09:42.873 --> 09:44.374
( bowl shatters )

09:44.374 --> 09:47.547
Great! Look at what
you made me do!

09:47.547 --> 09:50.801
( sighs )
Keep her occupied
while I clean this up.

09:50.801 --> 09:52.382
( cooing )

09:52.382 --> 09:56.266
( baby talks ) Here, Naomi,
you want a blankie?

09:56.266 --> 09:58.719
Dude, what do you
think you're doing?

09:58.719 --> 10:01.852
It's baby talk.
I'm trying to
speak her language.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.854
No, that's my blankie.

10:05.525 --> 10:07.147
Really?

10:07.147 --> 10:08.729
Yes, really.

10:08.729 --> 10:10.440
You know I get
the chillies.

10:11.822 --> 10:13.784
Uh, guys,

10:13.784 --> 10:15.575
my mangoes are missing.

10:17.037 --> 10:19.079
Ah, I see 'em.

10:19.079 --> 10:22.082
Hey, has anyone seen
the aging device?

10:22.082 --> 10:24.044
( cooing )

10:24.044 --> 10:27.507
Aw! Look, she thinks
it's a toy. ( chuckles )

10:27.507 --> 10:29.419
( yelps )

10:40.640 --> 10:42.853
Finally.

10:42.853 --> 10:44.354
Kneecaps.

10:53.273 --> 10:56.486
Whoa! What just happened?

10:56.486 --> 10:58.869
Aw! Her first words!

10:59.990 --> 11:01.581
( door opens )

11:01.581 --> 11:06.496
( out of breath ) Uh, guys,
have you seen Naomi?

11:06.496 --> 11:07.667
I'm Naomi.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.419
Very funny. ( scoffs )

11:09.419 --> 11:11.291
( shocked ) Naomi!

11:12.552 --> 11:13.924
I'm a big girl now.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.295
( baby talk )
Yes, you are!

11:17.718 --> 11:20.470
Chase, what is going on?

11:20.470 --> 11:22.602
Did you let her play
with one of your
little nerd toys?

11:22.602 --> 11:25.265
No, she
wandered down here

11:25.265 --> 11:29.109
and got a hold of
one of my little nerd toys.

11:29.109 --> 11:31.812
She must have crawled
in the hyperlift
while I was cleaning up.

11:31.812 --> 11:34.574
Oh, cool, well, then,
I think we can all agree
that this is your fault.

11:34.574 --> 11:38.578
No, Chase, turn her back
into a baby right now.

11:38.578 --> 11:42.122
I can't. I haven't been able
to crack age reversal yet,

11:42.122 --> 11:44.244
but if you're
looking for bumpy veins
and liver spots,

11:44.244 --> 11:45.455
I'm your man.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.628
OK, well,
you need to do something

11:48.628 --> 11:50.540
because Tasha is gonna
be back any minute,

11:50.540 --> 11:52.332
and I promised her
that I would do a good job

11:52.332 --> 11:53.593
taking care of Naomi.

11:53.593 --> 11:56.426
Hey, I'd say you did
a great job.

11:56.426 --> 11:57.838
I mean,
in a couple of hours,

11:57.838 --> 12:00.891
you raised a polite,
well-adjusted teenager.

12:00.891 --> 12:02.682
( door opens )

12:02.682 --> 12:04.514
Hey, guys.

12:04.514 --> 12:06.106
Who's this?

12:06.106 --> 12:08.188
Naomi. She crawled away
while Bree was babysitting

12:08.188 --> 12:09.850
and now she's
a big goofy teenager.

12:09.850 --> 12:11.191
( Oliver chuckles )

12:11.191 --> 12:12.853
( chuckles )
Wow, Bree,

12:12.853 --> 12:15.155
you are not good
at taking care of kids.

12:15.155 --> 12:16.777
( chuckles )

12:21.411 --> 12:22.492
Here we go.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.414
This should keep you warm.

12:24.414 --> 12:25.705
Wow. Look at that.

12:25.705 --> 12:27.707
My hoodie fits you perfectly.
( chuckles)

12:27.707 --> 12:29.709
Can't believe I'm saying that
to a one-year-old.

12:31.081 --> 12:32.082
Oh! Toys!

12:32.082 --> 12:34.634
Naomi, no!
No, no.

12:34.634 --> 12:36.506
( all straining )

12:36.506 --> 12:37.878
That's mine!

12:37.878 --> 12:38.929
( straining )

12:38.929 --> 12:40.090
Hey, girls!

12:40.090 --> 12:42.512
( gasps ) Tasha!
You're back!

12:42.512 --> 12:43.683
Who's your friend?

12:43.683 --> 12:45.555
Uh, w-what friend?

12:45.555 --> 12:46.476
Hi!
Uh...

12:46.476 --> 12:48.478
Oh! Oh, this is...
Jenny!

12:48.478 --> 12:49.479
Her name is Jenny.

12:49.479 --> 12:50.480
Yeah.
( Naomi giggling )

12:51.691 --> 12:53.313
Oh!
Mama!

12:53.313 --> 12:55.355
Little weird,
aren't you, Jenny?

12:56.606 --> 12:57.948
NAOMI: Oh!

12:57.948 --> 12:59.569
Hmm, so how'd it go
with the baby?

12:59.569 --> 13:01.531
Great. Perfect.
Awesome.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.783
Yeah, I--I think
all the time
she spent with Bree

13:03.783 --> 13:05.745
really made her grow
as a person.

13:05.745 --> 13:07.958
NAOMI: Oh!

13:07.958 --> 13:10.250
So, where is my little girl?

13:10.250 --> 13:12.332
Oh, she's, uh...
Um...

13:12.332 --> 13:15.045
she--she's down
in mission command...
w-with the boys.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.877
They couldn't resist
babysitting her.

13:16.877 --> 13:19.419
She's just
so darn cute.
( chuckles )

13:19.419 --> 13:21.511
I should go down
and check on her.

13:21.511 --> 13:22.552
Oh, no, you shouldn't.

13:25.015 --> 13:26.556
I mean, um,

13:26.556 --> 13:28.428
you should just sit down

13:28.428 --> 13:31.431
and relax. Yeah.
( laughing nervously )

13:31.431 --> 13:33.023
( giggling )

13:33.023 --> 13:34.024
( Bree chuckles nervously )

13:34.024 --> 13:35.065
Is she OK?

13:35.065 --> 13:37.357
( blows raspberry )

13:38.608 --> 13:40.240
Yeah, she's fine.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.242
She's just a little bit
of a kook. ( chuckles )

13:42.242 --> 13:45.445
When she gets bored,
she starts tossing
things up in the air

13:45.445 --> 13:47.207
and eating keys.

13:48.748 --> 13:51.251
Um, I'm gonna
bring her downstairs, uh,

13:51.251 --> 13:53.123
while you--
you get to know Skylar!

13:53.123 --> 13:54.794
What! No!
Don't leave me with her!

13:56.546 --> 13:59.719
I mean, because
that would be
so selfish.

13:59.719 --> 14:02.012
Like, you and Bree
should catch up.
I'll go.

14:02.012 --> 14:03.673
Uh, no, uh...

14:03.673 --> 14:05.675
Tasha and I are fine.
We talk all the time.

14:05.675 --> 14:07.097
No, we don't.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.889
You won't even give me
your phone number.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.852
I--I'll give you
Bree's number.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.105
But it's
in my phone downstairs.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.646
Jenny and I
will go get it.

14:16.646 --> 14:17.647
Bye!

14:17.647 --> 14:19.149
NAOMI: Whee!

14:23.243 --> 14:25.115
Well, that was rude.
( chuckles )

14:25.115 --> 14:26.486
Almost as rude as this.

14:30.410 --> 14:31.411
( door opens )

14:33.583 --> 14:35.755
Please tell me
it's going well down here.

14:35.755 --> 14:38.258
I could,
but that would be
a tremendous lie.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.501
I'm feeling cozy.

14:42.592 --> 14:44.504
OK, Tasha is freaking out,

14:44.504 --> 14:46.266
so you two need
to go upstairs and stall her.

14:46.266 --> 14:47.637
What? Why us?

14:47.637 --> 14:50.680
Because you're the kings
of meaningless conversation.

14:52.062 --> 14:53.683
Eh, she's not wrong.

14:55.475 --> 14:56.776
( beeps )

14:56.776 --> 14:58.728
Yes! I think I got it!

14:58.728 --> 15:00.110
Really?
Yeah!

15:00.110 --> 15:01.861
By tightening
the telomeres
to the DNA

15:01.861 --> 15:03.443
before the cell
divided itself,

15:03.443 --> 15:05.405
I was able to reverse
the aging process--

15:05.405 --> 15:06.616
Yeah, yeah.
No one cares.

15:11.741 --> 15:13.663
Yes, it's working!

15:15.205 --> 15:16.336
Oh, no!

15:20.540 --> 15:21.921
I didn't get a great look
at her before.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.503
Did she always
look like that?

15:25.675 --> 15:27.387
How could this happen?

15:27.387 --> 15:30.350
I don't know. I should have
tested it on more fruit.

15:30.350 --> 15:31.551
Where is my fruit?

15:33.763 --> 15:34.554
Sorry.

15:37.477 --> 15:38.768
Fix this.

15:38.768 --> 15:41.061
OK. I just need to get
some more equipment

15:41.061 --> 15:42.152
and fruit.

15:42.152 --> 15:43.483
Skyler,
can you help me?

15:43.483 --> 15:44.774
Why me?

15:44.774 --> 15:46.776
Because you're
eating my banana.

15:52.622 --> 15:54.704
Well, considering
who your father is,

15:54.704 --> 15:56.786
big heads do
run in the family.

15:58.668 --> 16:00.710
My neck hurts.

16:05.585 --> 16:06.636
So...

16:07.757 --> 16:10.640
Chase tells us
that you're a wife.

16:10.640 --> 16:11.641
What's that like?

16:13.853 --> 16:16.016
Yeah, and don't you
dare leave anything out.

16:18.938 --> 16:20.150
What are you doing?

16:20.150 --> 16:21.811
I'm trying to seem interested.

16:21.811 --> 16:24.024
By turning into J. Lo?

16:24.024 --> 16:25.945
That was not J. Lo.
It was obviously Beyoncé.

16:25.945 --> 16:27.817
Beyoncé's from Texas.
She doesn't speak like that.

16:27.817 --> 16:29.779
I didn't know
Beyoncé's from Texas!

16:31.201 --> 16:34.114
OK, what is going on here?

16:34.114 --> 16:36.706
Bree said she was gonna get
Naomi 15 minutes ago.

16:36.706 --> 16:38.418
I need to see my baby.

16:38.418 --> 16:40.330
No, you--
you can't go in there.

16:40.330 --> 16:41.331
Why not?

16:42.462 --> 16:44.884
Because, uh, you...

16:44.884 --> 16:47.627
Haven't had a chance to see
our superpowers yet.

16:47.627 --> 16:48.968
If you don't
get out of my way,

16:48.968 --> 16:51.471
I'm gonna show you
a superpower or two,

16:51.471 --> 16:53.433
starting with my death-stare.

16:55.435 --> 16:56.846
What is that?
That's, like,
not even a thing.

16:56.846 --> 16:58.348
Yeah, it looks
pretty real to me.

16:59.939 --> 17:01.691
OK, out of my way.

17:01.691 --> 17:03.353
Oh! Wait, uh,

17:03.353 --> 17:06.276
you haven't seen
our coolest ability of all.

17:07.697 --> 17:09.409
( Tasha screams )

17:09.409 --> 17:14.074
Don't worry.
He almost never drops anyone.

17:18.868 --> 17:20.960
Good news.
She's back to normal.

17:20.960 --> 17:24.834
Chase, she is a baby trapped
in a 16-year-old's body.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.086
That ain't normal.

17:28.668 --> 17:30.760
On my planet,
you stay a baby
for 25 years--

17:30.760 --> 17:32.262
You are not helping.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.346
I want my mama.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.601
Naomi, listen to me.

17:41.601 --> 17:43.853
I am so sorry.

17:43.853 --> 17:45.395
This whole thing
is my fault.

17:45.395 --> 17:48.528
I just-- I wanted
to spend time with you

17:48.528 --> 17:51.861
and prove that I could be
a good big sister--

17:51.861 --> 17:55.905
not just to your mom,
but to myself.

17:57.497 --> 17:59.699
BREE: I wanted you
to look up to me.

17:59.699 --> 18:02.792
But now that this
whole thing happened,

18:02.792 --> 18:05.795
you probably think
I am the worst sister ever.

18:07.507 --> 18:08.968
That's a lot of words.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.882
I don't even know
why I'm telling you this.

18:12.882 --> 18:13.883
You're just a baby.

18:14.924 --> 18:16.926
You're nice.

18:16.926 --> 18:18.558
( door opens )

18:21.521 --> 18:23.563
OK, what is going on?

18:23.563 --> 18:24.564
( Naomi squeals in excitement )

18:24.564 --> 18:26.025
Mama!

18:26.025 --> 18:28.278
Back off, Jenny.
Who raised you?

18:30.860 --> 18:32.942
Now, where is my baby?

18:32.942 --> 18:33.903
Um...

18:35.825 --> 18:39.619
Look, Tasha,
there's something
I have to tell you.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.332
So, right after you left,

18:42.332 --> 18:47.547
I turned my back on Naomi
for, like, two seconds,

18:47.547 --> 18:49.879
and she--
Yes! I found the fix!

18:51.171 --> 18:54.594
For one of my
nerdy science things.

18:54.594 --> 18:55.925
Carry on.

18:58.678 --> 19:02.892
Keep going. You turned
your back on Naomi for
two seconds and she...

19:02.892 --> 19:06.025
she...looked so cute,

19:06.025 --> 19:07.977
I--I just had to
take a picture.

19:07.977 --> 19:09.479
Here, let me show you.
( chuckles )

19:11.070 --> 19:12.192
No, that's not it.

19:20.119 --> 19:21.451
Yes!

19:21.451 --> 19:23.162
And that's not it either.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.045
I don't even know
what that is.

19:26.045 --> 19:28.338
Bree, these are just
pictures of boys you like,

19:28.338 --> 19:29.629
which is a lot!

19:29.629 --> 19:31.170
We should talk.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.215
Hey, why look
at a picture of Naomi

19:35.215 --> 19:37.136
when you can just look
at the real thing?

19:37.136 --> 19:40.390
Oh, yes! There you are!

19:40.390 --> 19:41.971
TASHA: Oh!

19:41.971 --> 19:45.064
I was really starting to think
something had happened to you!

19:45.064 --> 19:45.935
( scoffs )

19:45.935 --> 19:47.186
Nope, she's fine,

19:47.186 --> 19:48.648
but I am gonna
need that blanket back,

19:48.648 --> 19:50.019
and I'm definitely
want it dry-cleaned.

19:50.019 --> 19:51.901
( chuckles )

19:51.901 --> 19:54.734
Well, that's weird.
If I didn't know
any better,

19:54.734 --> 19:56.736
I would think that
you got bigger
since I left.

19:56.736 --> 19:58.578
( nervous laughter )
No way!

19:58.578 --> 20:00.240
No. What?
No!

20:00.240 --> 20:01.781
Come on!
That's impossible!

20:01.781 --> 20:03.202
( laughing ) No!
She might have.

20:12.001 --> 20:13.833
Well, Tasha...
( chuckles )

20:13.833 --> 20:17.046
sorry you didn't enjoy
your little aerial tour
of the city,

20:17.046 --> 20:18.798
but look at the bright side!

20:18.798 --> 20:20.179
You're probably
the first person

20:20.179 --> 20:22.642
to vomit on top
of Mr. Davenport's tower.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.765
I'll be sure
to let him know.

20:27.146 --> 20:28.808
( Naomi cooing )

20:29.979 --> 20:32.021
( all speaking in baby talk )

20:32.021 --> 20:33.192
( Tasha chuckles )

20:33.192 --> 20:35.565
Oliver,
it's just a baby.

20:35.565 --> 20:37.567
Stop being weird
and say good-bye.

20:37.567 --> 20:39.158
( Naomi cooing )

20:39.158 --> 20:40.450
Uh...

20:40.450 --> 20:41.951
Y-Yeah,
I'd rather be weird.

20:43.663 --> 20:45.995
I must say, Bree,
I underestimated you.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.127
You make
a great babysitter.

20:48.127 --> 20:50.630
I am definitely gonna
hit you up more often.

20:50.630 --> 20:52.001
Wait, really?

20:52.001 --> 20:53.633
Thanks!

20:53.633 --> 20:55.585
Can I hold her
one more time
before you go?

20:55.585 --> 20:57.427
Sure.

20:57.427 --> 20:59.138
Oh, hi...

20:59.138 --> 21:00.970
Ah! Oh, wow!

21:00.970 --> 21:03.222
Look at that.
She's not crying.

21:04.434 --> 21:06.185
I guess
we finally bonded.

21:06.185 --> 21:08.187

21:15.194 --> 21:17.066
