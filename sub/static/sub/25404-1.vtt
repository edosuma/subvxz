[screaming]

00:03.051 --> 00:04.217
Move! Get out now!

00:04.219 --> 00:06.452
Somebody secure the doors.

00:06.454 --> 00:08.454
The specimens have gotten out.

00:08.456 --> 00:09.957
Call security.

00:09.959 --> 00:11.658
The system's on lockdown.

00:11.660 --> 00:13.060
Everybody needs to move. Now.

00:13.062 --> 00:15.762
Everybody out.
Move, move, move.

00:15.764 --> 00:17.230
- Oh, God!
- Run!

00:17.232 --> 00:18.231
Come on!

00:18.233 --> 00:19.833
[screaming]

00:19.835 --> 00:22.538
Somebody get Martinelli.
The specimens have escaped.

- Okay, let's go!
- Move!

01:22.064 --> 01:23.329
Go! Go, go, go!

01:23.331 --> 01:25.297
[shouting, chattering]

01:25.299 --> 01:26.432
Hurry up!

01:26.434 --> 01:27.767
Go! Let's go!

01:27.769 --> 01:29.768
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:29.770 --> 01:31.270
Check the corners,
I have movement.

01:31.272 --> 01:33.172
Make sure the building's
on complete lockdown.

01:33.174 --> 01:34.341
Let's go.

01:34.343 --> 01:35.743
Clear the hall.
Clear it.

01:35.745 --> 01:36.943
- Let's go!
- Come on, everybody.

01:36.945 --> 01:38.378
Move, move, move.
Go, go, go.

01:38.380 --> 01:39.812
Get to the doors.
Make sure we complete lockdown.

01:39.814 --> 01:41.683
- Steady.
- Let's go!

01:46.022 --> 01:48.791
Help! Help!

02:02.404 --> 02:04.974
Shh, slow down.

02:07.775 --> 02:10.011
[man screams]

02:17.053 --> 02:18.988
[loud thump]

02:32.400 --> 02:33.802
Come on.

03:33.762 --> 03:36.230
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:36.232 --> 03:37.530
Just relax.

03:37.532 --> 03:39.099
Good, good. Relax.

03:39.101 --> 03:41.534
That's all right. You did enough
damage today, okay?

03:41.536 --> 03:43.369
We're gonna take you back, okay?

03:43.371 --> 03:45.439
Relax. Relax.

03:45.441 --> 03:47.673
Steady. Steady.

03:47.675 --> 03:49.776
Stay. Good.

03:49.778 --> 03:52.178
That's it.
Steady, girl.

03:52.180 --> 03:53.345
Stop.

03:53.347 --> 03:54.749
No!

04:02.391 --> 04:04.356
Smith?

04:04.358 --> 04:06.726
What are you doing?
Get the breakfast outta here.

04:06.728 --> 04:08.160
They'll be showing up
any minute.

04:08.162 --> 04:10.264
All right,
I'll eat faster then, huh?

04:10.266 --> 04:12.631
Here, I'll help you
get rid of that.

04:12.633 --> 04:16.103
You know, I woulda given
you one if you just asked.

04:16.105 --> 04:17.969
Where's Hyde run off to?

04:17.971 --> 04:19.572
He had to take a leak.

04:19.575 --> 04:21.707
Ah, geez, he can take a
squirt on his own time

04:21.709 --> 04:23.476
after this
muckety-muck arrives.

04:23.478 --> 04:25.413
The muckety-muck is here.

04:27.048 --> 04:29.683
Sorry.
You must be Bridget.

04:29.685 --> 04:31.017
Welcome to Triassic.

04:31.019 --> 04:32.719
I'm Thomas Atkins,
head of security.

04:32.721 --> 04:34.053
You're early.

04:34.055 --> 04:35.787
Steven is always early.

04:35.789 --> 04:37.190
I have him waiting
back in the car.

04:37.192 --> 04:38.390
Is everything ready
for his arrival?

04:38.392 --> 04:39.760
Yes, ma'am.

04:39.762 --> 04:41.193
We're operating with a
reduced staff today while

04:41.195 --> 04:42.863
Mr. Hagen's on the property.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.397
Only essential
personnel are present.

04:44.399 --> 04:45.868
Okay, good.

04:47.769 --> 04:50.406
Don't tell Martinelli
about this.

04:55.144 --> 04:58.779
Triassic's entire facility
comprises about seven acres,

04:58.781 --> 05:00.445
right here in
the heart of the city.

05:00.447 --> 05:03.183
- Ah, this campus is gorgeous.
- Oh, yeah.

05:03.185 --> 05:05.185
You take one look at this
place, you'd never believe

05:05.187 --> 05:06.419
what's actually inside.

05:06.421 --> 05:08.253
Yeah, we like to
keep a low profile.

05:08.255 --> 05:11.423
You know, we rarely have guests
that aren't already

05:11.425 --> 05:13.493
affiliated with the lab
in some capacity.

05:13.495 --> 05:15.661
So we're, like,
the first people anywhere

05:15.663 --> 05:17.496
to see inside this place?

05:17.498 --> 05:20.099
Yeah, pretty much.

05:20.101 --> 05:21.767
You hear that, dude?

05:21.769 --> 05:23.839
I'm awesome to hang out with.

05:25.139 --> 05:26.806
This is Dr. Marisa Martinelli,

05:26.808 --> 05:28.541
Chief Geneticist
here at Triassic.

05:28.543 --> 05:31.544
Doctor, we spoke on the phone.
I'm Bridget, this is Steven.

05:31.546 --> 05:33.947
So sorry I wasn't here
to meet you when you arrived.

05:33.949 --> 05:36.181
I'm sure Mr. Atkins
has done a wonderful job

05:36.183 --> 05:37.883
of showing you
around our grounds.

05:37.885 --> 05:39.351
Absolutely.

05:39.353 --> 05:41.286
Are you ready to see
the rest of our facility?

05:41.288 --> 05:45.161
- This way.
- Great meeting you.

06:05.714 --> 06:08.216
I'm gonna find you,
you son of a bitch.

06:24.966 --> 06:27.032
Would you like to see
the incubation chamber?

06:27.034 --> 06:28.501
- It's Marisa, right?
- Yeah.

06:28.503 --> 06:30.736
Marisa, maybe
we can see that later.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.371
Like I've said, I'm super
impressed with this place.

06:33.373 --> 06:35.676
The fact that you've been
able to remain solvent

06:35.678 --> 06:38.311
given the recent incidents at
other facilities working on

06:38.313 --> 06:41.046
experimental programs in
itself is impressive.

06:41.048 --> 06:43.616
But we both know why I'm here.

06:43.618 --> 06:46.618
You need funding,
and I'm your golden ticket.

06:46.620 --> 06:48.221
So let's get down to it.

06:48.223 --> 06:50.056
If I'm gonna invest
in something,

06:50.058 --> 06:52.358
I wanna see what
I'm working with.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.659
Very well.

06:53.661 --> 06:56.061
A man who likes to cut
to the chase. I like that.

06:56.063 --> 06:58.266
We can head to
the subject's holding room.

07:23.057 --> 07:25.791
Steven, what are you...

07:25.793 --> 07:28.663
Oh, my God.

07:40.474 --> 07:43.810
Mr. Hagen, this is Dr. Ovidio,
our Chief Immunologist.

07:43.812 --> 07:46.145
He takes care of the animals
and makes sure their organs

07:46.147 --> 07:48.281
are appropriate
for transplantation.

07:48.283 --> 07:50.082
Charles.

07:50.084 --> 07:53.919
This was all I ever
wanted

07:53.921 --> 07:55.921
when I was like nine years old,

07:55.923 --> 07:59.125
and now... here you are.

07:59.127 --> 08:02.794
After millions of
years of extinction.

08:02.796 --> 08:04.431
Don't get near it.

08:04.433 --> 08:05.931
No, it's okay.
This is G48.

08:05.933 --> 08:10.536
She's actually responsible
for the whole G-series.

08:10.538 --> 08:12.337
I have to admit, Marisa,

08:12.339 --> 08:14.140
I was more than
a little skeptical

08:14.142 --> 08:16.409
you had real, live
dinosaurs here.

08:16.411 --> 08:18.678
That's why I had to come.

08:18.680 --> 08:23.015
I didn't believe it.
But now...

08:23.017 --> 08:26.154
We make miracles
happen here every day.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.989
Come.

08:30.991 --> 08:32.961
See you.

08:37.932 --> 08:39.399
Who was that?

08:39.400 --> 08:42.168
That's our funding for
the next round of tests.

08:42.169 --> 08:44.603
Oh, you gotta love
the rich corporate types.

08:44.605 --> 08:45.771
Yeah.

08:45.773 --> 08:47.939
We do all the work,
they get all the glory.

08:47.941 --> 08:51.577
Oh, don't worry, Dr. Ovidio.

08:51.579 --> 08:55.581
You will be remembered as
the man who saved humanity.

08:55.583 --> 08:57.386
Oh, yeah?

08:59.186 --> 09:01.623
- Oh my God.
- Christ.

09:03.624 --> 09:05.094
Go. Work!

09:07.027 --> 09:09.464
[laughing]

09:17.473 --> 09:19.072
You ever lose one of these?

09:19.074 --> 09:21.841
We have designed a series
of fail-safe measure to prevent

09:21.843 --> 09:24.209
an escape of any animal
from this facility.

09:24.211 --> 09:25.711
I'm sure that helps
the insurance company

09:25.713 --> 09:27.279
sleep better at night.

09:27.281 --> 09:29.848
They're very explicit as
to precautionary conduct.

09:29.850 --> 09:32.385
Each subject is implanted
with a locator chip.

09:32.387 --> 09:34.986
Should any escape,
we can easily track them.

09:34.988 --> 09:37.557
If the chip goes out of range
of their confinement,

09:37.559 --> 09:40.693
a full facility lockdown
is enforced and all entrances

09:40.695 --> 09:43.962
and exits are sealed until the
animal is returned to its cage.

09:43.964 --> 09:46.198
What about the people inside?

09:46.200 --> 09:48.235
We have a safe room
in the facility.

09:48.237 --> 09:50.068
It is fully equipped
to house all personnel

09:50.070 --> 09:51.638
until the danger is past.

09:51.640 --> 09:54.443
It's perfectly safe for
both humans and animals.

10:03.751 --> 10:06.119
Diana, I'd like you
to meet Steven Hagen.

10:06.121 --> 10:10.526
Excuse me. Sorry.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.895
Spider, never kill 'em.

10:15.897 --> 10:19.098
It's rude considering
everything that they do for us.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.233
Ms. Osgood is our
chief bioengineer

10:21.235 --> 10:23.135
and the woman responsible
for giving the gift

10:23.137 --> 10:25.103
of life to all of our dinos.

10:25.105 --> 10:28.842
Oh, I guess that
makes you Mom....

10:28.844 --> 10:30.342
I guess it does.

10:30.344 --> 10:31.845
And a very protective one.

10:31.847 --> 10:33.379
Hey, I'm no threat.

10:33.381 --> 10:36.582
I'm just here to observe
and ask dumb questions.

10:36.584 --> 10:41.987
The dinosaurs, they don't
share any of our DNA?

10:41.989 --> 10:43.490
No.

10:43.492 --> 10:46.292
We give them carefully
metered doses of complex

10:46.294 --> 10:49.261
human proteins and hormones
so that the organs

10:49.263 --> 10:51.130
that grow inside of
them are suitable

10:51.132 --> 10:52.865
for xenotransplantation.

10:52.867 --> 10:54.967
But this doesn't give them
the abilities

10:54.969 --> 10:57.437
or brain capacity of a human.

10:57.439 --> 11:00.472
They tried it with pigs,
but there were risks.

11:00.474 --> 11:03.375
Humans don't have an immunity
to fight viruses

11:03.377 --> 11:06.545
that derive from animals,
like swine flu.

11:06.547 --> 11:07.847
Hmm.

11:07.849 --> 11:10.817
But the fossil records
have shown that dinosaurs

11:10.819 --> 11:14.386
had immune systems as strong
and sophisticated as ours

11:14.388 --> 11:17.090
and disease was rare,
reducing any threat

11:17.092 --> 11:19.058
of cross-species infections...

11:19.060 --> 11:21.160
making the Gojirasaurus
ideal hosts

11:21.162 --> 11:23.696
for growing
human-compatible organs.

11:23.698 --> 11:26.465
We're about 120 days out
from implanting

11:26.467 --> 11:29.669
our very first organ
into a human recipient.

11:29.671 --> 11:32.871
Wow.
That's really amazing.

11:32.873 --> 11:35.276
We're very careful.

11:41.181 --> 11:43.215
Unbelievable.

11:43.217 --> 11:45.320
Shall we continue
to the pharmacy?

12:01.002 --> 12:03.669
Organ recipients can
spend their entire lives

12:03.671 --> 12:07.173
on immunosuppressants to
prevent transplant rejection.

12:07.175 --> 12:10.709
The human DNA in our dinos
helps prevent this rejection...

12:10.711 --> 12:12.978
And now you can take
organs from this creature

12:12.980 --> 12:16.481
that was once extinct
to improve our lives.

12:16.483 --> 12:18.717
You've given them more time.

12:18.719 --> 12:22.925
Why not give it to ourselves as
a way to extend our lifespan?

12:33.633 --> 12:35.568
Certainly a bold vision,
Mr. Hagen.

12:35.570 --> 12:37.502
And one I'm ready to put
a significant amount

12:37.504 --> 12:40.106
of resources towards
realizing.

12:40.108 --> 12:42.607
When the first organ goes
into a human being,

12:42.609 --> 12:45.678
people from all walks of life,
affected by your research.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.614
I want in before it happens.

12:47.616 --> 12:49.384
Set the course for
what happens next.

12:50.449 --> 12:51.583
I appreciate that enthusiasm.

12:51.585 --> 12:53.553
You've brought dinosaurs
back from the dead

12:53.555 --> 12:56.054
with immune systems
just like ours, right?

12:56.056 --> 12:59.024
Let's a crack a few open,
see what makes them tick.

12:59.026 --> 13:00.226
Let's make some progress...

13:00.228 --> 13:01.895
What did you just say?

13:01.897 --> 13:05.997
These are complicated
living beings forced

13:05.999 --> 13:09.534
to endure invasive tests in
conditions they did not ask for.

13:09.536 --> 13:11.537
They get scared and they
can feel pain

13:11.539 --> 13:12.938
and they deserve compassion
and respect.

13:12.940 --> 13:14.439
Diana...

13:14.441 --> 13:16.108
No, it's okay, Marisa.
It's fine.

13:16.110 --> 13:19.412
Osgood, you know the trials
and tests these dinosaurs

13:19.414 --> 13:21.780
are exposed to here.

13:21.782 --> 13:25.885
How do you justify your
hand in it then... Mom?

13:25.887 --> 13:28.020
I don't believe that I need
to justify anything

13:28.022 --> 13:30.656
about my actions to you.

13:30.658 --> 13:32.792
Good for you, Oz.
Take a stand.

13:32.794 --> 13:34.726
Just let me know what it is
and when you find it.

13:34.728 --> 13:37.297
This work can save real lives.

13:37.299 --> 13:40.000
I watched someone
very important to me die

13:40.002 --> 13:41.567
on an organ donor waiting list.

13:41.569 --> 13:44.002
I won't let anyone else
suffer the same cruelty

13:44.004 --> 13:45.438
as long as I can help it.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.673
There are limits, Mr. Hagen.

13:47.675 --> 13:50.175
Even it if means
prolonging the very breakthrough

13:50.177 --> 13:53.678
that could save all those
lives by just one day?

13:53.680 --> 13:55.814
Progress is relative.

13:55.816 --> 13:57.750
I'll gladly wait one
more day knowing

13:57.752 --> 14:00.052
that I did everything
humanely the first time.

14:00.054 --> 14:01.987
But it won't be for some
failed pipe dream

14:01.989 --> 14:04.959
attempted by better,
richer men before you.

14:08.463 --> 14:11.967
Well, maybe they didn't
have my vision on it.

14:13.834 --> 14:15.934
Steven, it's Taipei
on the line.

14:15.936 --> 14:18.739
Hold that thought.
I gotta take this.

14:22.009 --> 14:23.242
What is wrong with you?

14:23.244 --> 14:25.311
- "Crack a few op..."
- Shh.

14:25.313 --> 14:28.047
Don't tell me you're happy to
condone this kind of nonsense.

14:28.049 --> 14:29.548
Nobody asked you.

14:29.550 --> 14:31.851
All you had to do was
explain the processes

14:31.853 --> 14:33.818
and answer a few questions.
That's it.

14:33.820 --> 14:36.823
Not get into an argument
with the man we need, frankly,

14:36.825 --> 14:39.290
to help fund the work
I'm hoping to finish.

14:39.292 --> 14:41.360
Oh, you want explanation?

14:41.362 --> 14:42.861
How's this?

14:42.863 --> 14:45.564
Even a four percent
Goji mortality rate puts us

14:45.566 --> 14:47.799
past median average
and flirting with

14:47.801 --> 14:50.068
multiple Prehistoric
Animal Regulation Commission

14:50.070 --> 14:51.871
and FDA violations.

14:51.873 --> 14:54.307
If Count Dracula out there
starts footing the bill

14:54.309 --> 14:56.808
around here, we'll be applying
for recertifications

14:56.810 --> 14:59.578
and raising our mortality
ceiling in six months,

14:59.580 --> 15:02.680
wiping out all of our
predicted maturity rates.

15:02.682 --> 15:05.885
Not to mention,
it's obscenely stupid.

15:05.887 --> 15:09.255
These creatures are going to
revolutionize medical science,

15:09.257 --> 15:12.658
and public funding will not see
us through final development.

15:12.660 --> 15:15.593
You need to readjust
your priorities, damn it.

15:15.595 --> 15:17.963
The Gojis are product.

15:17.965 --> 15:20.667
My apologies.
Where were we?

15:20.669 --> 15:23.303
Your definition of progress.

15:23.305 --> 15:25.507
Enjoy the rest of your tour.

15:26.306 --> 15:28.609
Shall we, uh, continue?

15:39.320 --> 15:41.123
Jesus Christ.

15:45.126 --> 15:46.826
[screams]

15:46.828 --> 15:48.327
No. No!

15:48.329 --> 15:49.495
No!

15:49.497 --> 15:51.466
No. No.

15:54.167 --> 15:55.433
[grunting and screaming]

15:55.435 --> 15:57.169
Let's go! Come on!

15:57.171 --> 15:59.141
[grunting]

16:03.411 --> 16:04.843
I'm sorry.

16:04.845 --> 16:06.946
Diana is incredibly dedicated
to her work,

16:06.948 --> 16:09.384
particularly with all
the FDA and PARC regulations

16:10.449 --> 16:10.949
we have to comply
with around here.

16:10.951 --> 16:13.217
It must be impossible
to remain in compliance.

16:13.219 --> 16:14.787
Oh, you have no idea.

16:14.789 --> 16:16.789
Every time one of those
amusement parks suffers

16:16.791 --> 16:19.591
a new tragedy, the PARC
finds new things to legislate,

16:19.593 --> 16:21.159
and then we have
to play catch-up.

16:21.161 --> 16:22.395
Yep.

16:22.397 --> 16:24.096
The cost of compliance
is astronomical,

16:24.098 --> 16:25.731
and very often our work
can suffer

16:25.733 --> 16:27.399
as a result
of all the regulations.

16:27.401 --> 16:28.967
I guess I can understand
now why

16:28.969 --> 16:30.803
she's none too pleased with me.

16:30.805 --> 16:32.804
Yes. Well,
she can sometimes get

16:32.806 --> 16:34.740
a little too close to her work.

16:34.742 --> 16:36.308
She's been present at
the birth of every

16:36.310 --> 16:38.276
Gojirasaurus in this facility.

16:38.278 --> 16:39.611
Oftentimes we don't even...

16:39.613 --> 16:41.649
[screaming]

16:42.517 --> 16:43.919
Everybody, go. Move!

16:50.657 --> 16:52.824
Call security!
We need a full lockdown.

16:52.826 --> 16:54.360
Everybody lock all the doors.

16:54.362 --> 16:56.395
We need a full lockdown.

16:56.397 --> 16:58.733
[screaming]

17:01.036 --> 17:02.938
[screaming]

17:10.344 --> 17:12.213
Get us out of here!

17:13.213 --> 17:15.749
[screaming]

17:16.616 --> 17:18.717
<i>There has been a breach.</i>

17:18.719 --> 17:21.419
<i>All personnel to facility
safe room immediately.</i>

17:21.421 --> 17:22.954
<i>There has been a breach.</i>

17:22.957 --> 17:25.424
<i>All personnel to facility

17:25.425 --> 17:27.192
<i>There has been a breach.</i>

17:27.194 --> 17:30.161
<i>All personnel to facility
safe room immediately.</i>

17:30.163 --> 17:32.931
We stay at code three
until I say otherwise.

17:32.933 --> 17:34.235
Got it?

17:35.236 --> 17:36.938
[grunting]

17:58.159 --> 18:00.592
Smith, first aid, stat.
We got injuries here.

18:00.594 --> 18:01.995
You got it.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.698
Ah, he's bleeding bad.

18:06.534 --> 18:08.133
How 'bout you?
Are you hurt?

18:08.135 --> 18:10.236
No. What happened?
What's going on?

18:10.238 --> 18:11.704
G32.

18:11.706 --> 18:13.005
That was G32.

18:13.007 --> 18:14.573
She broke free during
euthanization.

18:14.575 --> 18:17.944
Marisa, I never got a euth
notice for the 30 series.

18:17.946 --> 18:21.546
Is there a breach?
Is everybody all right?

18:21.548 --> 18:22.948
Anyone hurt?

18:22.950 --> 18:25.950
Close the door!
Close the door, please.

18:25.952 --> 18:28.420
Dr. Martinelli,
is this everybody?

18:28.422 --> 18:30.322
Uh, yes. Yes.

18:30.324 --> 18:32.294
Close it.
Shut it.

18:34.062 --> 18:37.299
That thing has bitten Steven.

18:39.967 --> 18:41.801
How many we got on the loose?

18:41.803 --> 18:43.267
Just the one.

18:43.269 --> 18:45.272
Chief, doors are locked
but I can't find her.

18:46.841 --> 18:48.541
We were working
on G48 earlier.

18:48.543 --> 18:53.044
She went to the testing room.
There's no way out.

18:53.046 --> 18:55.150
[moaning]

18:59.152 --> 19:00.419
Found her.

19:00.421 --> 19:02.321
Corridor B, Immunology Wing.

19:02.323 --> 19:04.258
Locking her in.

19:10.664 --> 19:12.797
We're going to
the Armory and load up.

19:12.799 --> 19:14.565
That dino's not going anywhere.

19:14.567 --> 19:16.768
We get this thing back in
the cage or we take her down.

19:16.770 --> 19:18.137
The lockdown is lifted.

19:18.139 --> 19:20.305
Smith, Hyde, you're
coming with me.

19:20.307 --> 19:21.640
Let's go deal with this.

19:21.642 --> 19:23.709
I have to come with you.

19:23.711 --> 19:25.878
How does something
like this happen?

19:25.880 --> 19:28.514
Look at me.
Look what it did to me.

19:28.516 --> 19:29.915
That's out of the question.

19:29.917 --> 19:31.350
We'll get G32 back
into her enclosure,

19:31.352 --> 19:32.817
or we'll put her down.

19:32.819 --> 19:34.553
Either way, you're much
safer staying here.

19:34.555 --> 19:37.957
Mr. Atkins, I appreciate
your insistence on keeping us

19:37.959 --> 19:39.757
all safe and secure,

19:39.759 --> 19:41.928
but I am the director
of this facility.

19:41.930 --> 19:45.331
I need to be there to make
sure everyone is protected.

19:45.333 --> 19:48.870
Besides, I'm the only
person with the code.

19:50.504 --> 19:53.007
That is a final order.

19:54.875 --> 19:57.075
Stay behind us at all times.

19:57.077 --> 19:59.245
Do what I say, when I say,

19:59.247 --> 20:01.213
and, please, don't ask me why.

20:01.215 --> 20:02.547
Just act.

20:02.549 --> 20:05.919
You're finished, Marisa.

20:07.488 --> 20:08.955
You hear me?

20:08.957 --> 20:11.524
- Sir, please... please stay calm.
- Are you hearing me?

20:11.526 --> 20:15.761
I'm gonna sue you and everyone
else in this goddamn room.

20:15.763 --> 20:16.894
I need you
to stay still, okay?

20:16.896 --> 20:19.931
We leaving these here?

20:19.933 --> 20:22.368
Take one, just in case.

20:22.370 --> 20:24.069
And grab some radios, too.

20:24.071 --> 20:26.371
We'll leave one here so you
can reach us if need be.

20:26.373 --> 20:28.774
Sue? No, no, no.

20:28.776 --> 20:31.576
I will own you!

20:31.578 --> 20:33.312
Take care of them.

20:33.314 --> 20:34.580
Don't worry.

20:34.582 --> 20:36.515
We'll do everything
we can to get her back

20:36.517 --> 20:38.583
without killing her.
Okay?

20:38.585 --> 20:42.155
The rest of you stay put till we
get back to give the all-clear.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.392
[Hagen moaning]

20:59.640 --> 21:02.073
You wanna explain me to why
we have a safe room facility

21:02.075 --> 21:03.976
where our only means for
defense are these pistols

21:03.978 --> 21:05.777
that shoot tranq darts
and not live rounds?

21:05.779 --> 21:08.980
These animals are valuable
assets representing significant

21:08.982 --> 21:10.882
high dollar values for
research and development.

21:10.884 --> 21:12.752
The safety procedures
are set up so that

21:12.754 --> 21:14.986
we never damage the investment.

21:14.988 --> 21:16.988
Unless I didn't hear
you correctly earlier,

21:16.990 --> 21:18.690
this thing's supposed
to be dead.

21:18.692 --> 21:20.292
A dollar value is zero.

21:20.294 --> 21:22.894
G32 has proven
extremely valuable.

21:22.896 --> 21:25.030
These tranquilizers are
crucial for the next time

21:25.032 --> 21:26.398
an asset might get loose.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.932
We must preserve
its scientific integrity.

21:27.934 --> 21:29.301
When is that
gonna happen, huh?

21:29.303 --> 21:31.169
You mean another one's
gonna get loose?

21:31.171 --> 21:33.205
Your investment killed people,
lady, including one of our men.

21:33.207 --> 21:35.142
We'll take it down
if we have to.

21:36.209 --> 21:38.212
[moans]

21:44.818 --> 21:47.821
My whole body's in pain.

21:50.723 --> 21:53.393
Bridget, I'm so thirsty.

21:55.728 --> 21:57.832
Can you get me some water?

21:59.165 --> 22:00.166
Please?

22:00.168 --> 22:01.967
Is there any water in here?

22:01.969 --> 22:04.238
Yes, hold on.

22:10.611 --> 22:12.347
Thank you.

22:17.617 --> 22:22.923
I can't... I can't...
I can't open it.

22:40.141 --> 22:41.543
[moans]

22:48.882 --> 22:51.717
You think they've
gotten there yet?

22:51.719 --> 22:53.451
I don't know.

22:53.453 --> 22:56.153
But once they get her
back to the enclosure,

22:56.155 --> 22:58.323
this'll all be over.

22:58.325 --> 23:01.192
And what if they
don't get her back?

23:01.194 --> 23:02.963
What happens to him?

23:03.930 --> 23:06.267
What happens to us?

23:08.669 --> 23:10.305
Where...?

23:11.838 --> 23:13.340
What happened?

23:14.642 --> 23:15.940
Look.

23:15.942 --> 23:18.011
She's heading right
towards them.

23:21.215 --> 23:23.682
- I've gotta go help them.
- I'm going with you.

23:23.684 --> 23:25.883
Charles, no.

23:25.885 --> 23:28.320
Charles, if Mr. Hagen
gets worse,

23:28.322 --> 23:30.389
he'll need someone
with medical training.

23:30.391 --> 23:32.457
Trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

23:32.459 --> 23:33.891
Go.

G32 is missing from the cameras.

She's still out there.

What kind of animal?</i>

26:49.323 --> 26:52.226
A Gojirasaurus.
A dinosaur.

26:54.694 --> 26:55.960
Hello?

26:55.962 --> 26:59.730
Uh, are you aware of the
penalty for making a prank?

26:59.732 --> 27:01.132
<i>Officer, listen to me.</i>

27:01.134 --> 27:04.936
I've got one fatality and
already multiple injuries.

27:04.938 --> 27:08.040
Ca... can someone let me in?

27:08.042 --> 27:09.608
Not at this time.

27:09.610 --> 27:11.575
The entire facility
is on lockdown

27:11.577 --> 27:13.445
<i>to make sure
it doesn't get out.</i>

27:13.447 --> 27:15.880
We have to get outta here.
Cops are... are here.

27:15.882 --> 27:17.314
Can't we just go?

27:17.316 --> 27:18.949
We're still waiting
to lift the lockdown.

27:18.951 --> 27:20.852
I need you to calm down.

27:20.854 --> 27:24.989
Officer, how you can help is
getting paramedics on standby

27:24.991 --> 27:28.659
and setting up a perimeter
in the event we suffer a breach.

27:28.661 --> 27:31.996
<i>In case
if your dinosaur gets out?</i>

27:31.998 --> 27:34.267
Just do what I ask.
Please.

27:38.171 --> 27:40.740
Is he saying
they can't get in?

27:46.646 --> 27:50.484
Can't you hear me?
Is he saying they can't get in?

27:53.453 --> 27:55.853
Three Lincoln 19 to Dispatch.

27:55.855 --> 27:57.989
<i>Go ahead.</i>

27:57.991 --> 27:59.891
I'm out here at Triassic Labs,

27:59.893 --> 28:03.296
and I really think
there's a situation here.

28:17.277 --> 28:19.678
Mr. Atkins,
we must go back out.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.580
I've got a seriously
injured man over here.

28:21.582 --> 28:23.849
You need to give me a minute.

28:23.851 --> 28:25.551
You don't understand.

28:25.553 --> 28:28.019
This is a top priority situation
we are dealing with here.

28:28.021 --> 28:31.422
We must contain this animal
before it kills someone else.

28:31.424 --> 28:33.925
Or, God forbid, figures
out a way to escape

28:33.927 --> 28:35.127
from this facility.

28:35.129 --> 28:36.628
You all heard
what the cop said.

28:36.630 --> 28:38.496
They can't get in,
and we can't get out.

28:38.498 --> 28:40.098
We are trapped here.

28:40.100 --> 28:42.967
We can wait inside here till
they figure out a way to get in.

28:42.969 --> 28:45.504
I can't risk letting anyone
else out of this room.

28:45.506 --> 28:49.006
I'm afraid it's not as
simple as just waiting.

28:49.008 --> 28:50.676
What do you mean?

28:50.678 --> 28:52.945
The escape triggers
a lockdown,

28:52.947 --> 28:55.980
yes, but there is a
secondary precaution.

28:55.982 --> 28:58.316
What are you talking about?

28:58.318 --> 28:59.884
There is a limited
time available

28:59.886 --> 29:02.021
to take the subject
down before...

29:02.023 --> 29:03.255
Before what?

29:03.257 --> 29:04.857
Before Code Four.

29:04.859 --> 29:07.395
What is Code Four?

29:12.266 --> 29:14.733
What is Code Four, Marisa?

29:14.735 --> 29:16.901
If for some reason the animal
is not apprehended or destroyed

29:16.903 --> 29:19.437
in the first two hours
after a breach,

29:19.439 --> 29:21.840
it causes a trigger
of halon gas,

29:21.842 --> 29:24.342
which will wipe out
everything in the building.

29:24.344 --> 29:28.246
Plants, animals... humans.

29:28.248 --> 29:30.948
It's part of the procedure.

29:30.950 --> 29:33.017
How come
I've never heard of this?

29:33.019 --> 29:34.552
It's above your clearance.

29:34.554 --> 29:37.323
I thought you said
we were safe in here.

29:37.325 --> 29:39.158
And you are, from an attack.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.994
But once Code Four is triggered,
there is no stopping it.

29:41.996 --> 29:44.830
Lady, when we get outta here,

29:44.832 --> 29:47.431
I promise what you did
here will be exposed.

29:47.433 --> 29:49.467
There'll be no more experiments.

29:49.469 --> 29:52.536
Come on, Tom,
we need to stop G32.

29:52.538 --> 29:56.477
You go.
We'll take care of him.

30:03.150 --> 30:04.783
Easy. Smith?

30:04.785 --> 30:06.149
Yeah?

30:06.151 --> 30:08.585
I need you to get bandaged up,
then I need your eyes

30:08.587 --> 30:10.388
and ears to help me corral
this son of a bitch.

30:10.390 --> 30:12.056
All right?

30:12.058 --> 30:13.292
All right, boss.

30:13.294 --> 30:15.830
- Okay. We'll be back.
- Yeah.

30:17.764 --> 30:20.498
This animal hasn't even
started to put up a fight.

30:20.500 --> 30:23.536
We need to be extremely careful.

30:36.115 --> 30:37.349
Smith, talk to me, man.

30:37.351 --> 30:39.350
You got a location
on this thing?

30:39.352 --> 30:41.622
<i>No, boss.
Still looking.</i>

31:01.475 --> 31:05.209
There's nothing yet.
How you doing? You okay?

31:05.211 --> 31:06.678
We just hit her
with 12 milligrams

31:06.680 --> 31:08.313
of carfentanil xylazine.

31:08.315 --> 31:09.846
That's more than enough.

31:09.848 --> 31:12.784
She's out there.
Keep looking.

31:12.786 --> 31:15.323
Copy.

31:29.003 --> 31:31.303
<i>Those tranqs should have
put it to sleep by now.</i>

31:31.305 --> 31:33.641
<i>That might be why
we're not finding it.</i>

31:36.844 --> 31:39.143
They haven't located G32?

31:39.145 --> 31:41.479
You heard him.

31:41.481 --> 31:43.718
Tranqs probably did the trick.

31:58.565 --> 32:00.468
It's in the break room.

32:01.602 --> 32:03.101
We've got it cornered.

32:03.103 --> 32:07.775
We hit her with the darts
and make a run for it.

32:09.642 --> 32:12.142
If we're lucky,
she'll take the bait.

32:12.144 --> 32:14.981
You're talking about
outrunning a dinosaur.

32:19.018 --> 32:23.955
She's fast,
but she's made for sprints.

32:23.957 --> 32:29.159
I figure, we hit her with
enough darts, slow her down.

32:29.161 --> 32:33.297
Stay far enough ahead of her,
we may be able to lure her

32:33.299 --> 32:35.502
all the way back
to the test room.

32:37.237 --> 32:38.973
Let me see your gun.

32:44.812 --> 32:46.013
Here.

32:57.090 --> 32:58.659
You ready?

33:18.946 --> 33:20.844
False alarm.

33:20.846 --> 33:23.517
We don't have it cornered.
Let's keep looking.

33:24.985 --> 33:26.017
What?

33:26.019 --> 33:28.488
Hide.

33:29.489 --> 33:33.026
Hide. Hide.

33:48.208 --> 33:50.042
Found her.

33:50.044 --> 33:51.575
Atkins, come in.

33:51.577 --> 33:54.478
We've got a 20 on the thing.

33:54.480 --> 33:56.584
Repeat, we've found the dino.

34:02.555 --> 34:04.123
Get ready to run.

34:27.214 --> 34:29.083
[loud crash]

34:44.897 --> 34:47.531
It's got us cornered,
but it'll probably

34:47.533 --> 34:49.202
come at me first if I shoot.

35:38.551 --> 35:39.920
It's gone.

36:01.942 --> 36:03.975
<i>Smith? You there?</i>

36:03.977 --> 36:06.143
We're here.
Are you all right?

36:06.145 --> 36:08.812
Thought we lost you
there for a second.

36:08.814 --> 36:10.348
Is everyone okay?

36:10.350 --> 36:11.949
<i>Still in one piece.</i>

36:11.951 --> 36:13.984
<i>Now we gotta figure out
to contain this thing.</i>

36:13.986 --> 36:16.288
<i>We're headed back over
to Corridor B.</i>

36:16.290 --> 36:18.058
Copy.

36:18.991 --> 36:20.625
I'm gonna go help them.

36:20.627 --> 36:23.828
No. No, don't do this.

36:23.830 --> 36:26.830
What do you think you're doing?

36:26.832 --> 36:29.000
Don't do this.

36:29.002 --> 36:32.038
Charles, don't leave me here.

36:33.439 --> 36:37.710
Eva, I'm partially
responsible for this.

36:42.216 --> 36:43.848
They need my help.

36:43.850 --> 36:45.219
It's okay.

36:47.821 --> 36:51.455
Hey, uh, I'm gonna meet you
guys at the containment room.

36:51.457 --> 36:54.692
Um, maybe we can find
some prods or something

36:54.694 --> 36:57.197
to help lead her back.

37:12.678 --> 37:15.745
Your animal clawed its way
out of the containment area.

37:15.747 --> 37:18.718
It started with
the floor first.

37:21.553 --> 37:27.093
When it hit concrete, it looked
for another way out instead.

37:28.393 --> 37:30.627
I figure a dumb animal
would just keeping

37:30.629 --> 37:32.263
working the same spot.

37:32.265 --> 37:34.699
We're not really working
with a dummy here, are we, Doc?

37:34.701 --> 37:38.205
No. We aren't.

37:39.471 --> 37:41.438
It's just like
the keypad at the Armory.

37:41.440 --> 37:42.640
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:42.642 --> 37:45.275
Like she waiting
for you to arrive.

37:45.277 --> 37:47.180
[chuckles]

37:47.948 --> 37:50.049
<i>Y'all seeing this?</i>

38:02.161 --> 38:04.328
<i>Well, we can forget
about containment barriers</i>

38:04.330 --> 38:06.063
<i>from here on out.</i>

38:06.065 --> 38:08.299
<i>We're on our way back now.
Coast is clear?</i>

38:08.301 --> 38:10.467
I don't see her,
but they need to get back here

38:10.469 --> 38:12.103
as fast as they can.

38:12.105 --> 38:13.770
You're clear
but double-time it.

38:13.772 --> 38:15.308
<i>Copy.</i>

38:26.185 --> 38:29.821
What really has me worried
is that its next move

38:29.823 --> 38:31.556
was for the Armory.

38:31.558 --> 38:34.792
The damn thing could have gone
anywhere in the entire place,

38:34.794 --> 38:36.560
but it was waiting for us
when we arrived.

38:36.562 --> 38:37.962
Well, these are
highly intelligent creatures

38:37.964 --> 38:38.996
we're dealing with here.

38:38.998 --> 38:41.399
Intelligent, sure.

38:41.401 --> 38:43.033
Staging an ambush?

38:43.035 --> 38:45.236
Someone care to explain
that one to me?

38:45.238 --> 38:46.770
This is like
a game to you people.

38:46.772 --> 38:50.975
Who cares about the dinosaur?
Steven is gonna die.

38:50.977 --> 38:54.045
Help has to be coming, right?

38:54.047 --> 38:56.013
I mean, how much longer
can it take?

38:56.015 --> 38:59.250
We told them a dinosaur
is on the loose.

38:59.252 --> 39:01.252
We don't even know
if they believed us.

39:01.254 --> 39:03.353
They'll just be sitting
out there waiting for

39:03.355 --> 39:05.156
the electronic lockdown
to be released

39:05.158 --> 39:07.591
before they can help us anyway.

39:07.593 --> 39:09.493
Then how do we get outta here?

39:09.495 --> 39:11.429
This is all your fault.

39:11.431 --> 39:13.063
If you hadn't brought us
to the safe room,

39:13.065 --> 39:14.866
we could've gotten out.

39:14.868 --> 39:17.167
You knew this was a trap.

39:17.169 --> 39:19.536
You knew we were gonna die.

39:19.538 --> 39:21.772
And why would I want that?

39:21.774 --> 39:23.975
I was following procedures.

39:23.977 --> 39:26.277
Well, your procedures suck.

39:26.279 --> 39:29.114
If we are able
to just figure a way-

39:29.116 --> 39:33.417
Marisa, I am tired of
hearing about your ideas.

39:33.419 --> 39:37.020
This is about you
saving your own ass.

39:37.022 --> 39:38.823
You have put innocent lives
in danger

39:38.825 --> 39:40.424
and destroyed our work here.

39:40.426 --> 39:42.527
I was doing what I thought
was right for the research.

39:42.529 --> 39:45.129
You have done nothing
except put us all in danger.

39:45.131 --> 39:46.964
Diana, I think you
need to know exactly

39:46.966 --> 39:48.232
where your station is.

39:48.234 --> 39:50.335
How dare you?
What are you-

39:50.337 --> 39:51.371
What-

39:54.908 --> 39:57.942
What's going on?

39:57.944 --> 39:59.576
Code Four has been triggered.

39:59.578 --> 40:01.346
Is this what you wanted?

40:01.348 --> 40:03.214
I can't understand why
you're going on about this.

40:03.216 --> 40:04.949
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

40:04.951 --> 40:06.887
[overlapping dialogue]

40:11.591 --> 40:13.091
Everyone be quiet!

40:13.093 --> 40:15.259
The safe room has an emergency
back-up generator, okay?

40:15.261 --> 40:16.930
It's coming back.

40:18.297 --> 40:20.334
[screams]

40:45.757 --> 40:47.493
She's doing it again.

40:48.460 --> 40:50.027
The walls.

40:50.029 --> 40:52.295
It's gonna get in.

40:52.297 --> 40:55.102
Get me out.
Get me outta here.

40:56.002 --> 40:58.906
She's not getting in.

41:06.678 --> 41:09.179
Hey, see?

41:09.181 --> 41:12.252
She didn't get in.
She won't.

41:13.386 --> 41:15.652
Tell me what you
wanna do next.

41:15.654 --> 41:18.723
Sure. I'll tell you as soon as
I come up with something.

41:18.725 --> 41:20.591
How about the tranqs?
Could you try those again?

41:20.593 --> 41:22.092
What's the point?

41:22.094 --> 41:24.060
He's just trying
to fix your mess, okay?

41:24.062 --> 41:26.397
Wait. Just hold on.

41:26.399 --> 41:28.266
The carfentanil
hasn't kicked in.

41:28.268 --> 41:31.101
These doses take
at least 10, 15 minutes.

41:31.103 --> 41:32.969
Okay, so then
we dose it up with more.

41:32.971 --> 41:34.705
You saw the way
she was acting.

41:34.707 --> 41:37.040
We start shooting her with more,
the pain from the darts

41:37.042 --> 41:38.775
will only make
her panic and retaliate.

41:38.777 --> 41:40.877
Are you kidding me right now?

41:40.879 --> 41:42.712
You're telling me 12 doses of
this stuff won't knock her down?

41:42.714 --> 41:44.982
Two doses should have.
Twelve might kill her.

41:44.984 --> 41:47.417
Okay, so then what are
we still talking about it for?

41:47.419 --> 41:50.687
You will get yourself killed
trying to give them to her.

41:50.689 --> 41:54.625
This animal is desperate,
angry, and confused.

41:54.627 --> 41:56.460
Now you want to hurt
her some more?

41:56.462 --> 41:59.397
It's just gonna make it
more aggressive.

41:59.399 --> 42:02.766
Okay. So then what do you
suggest we do?

42:02.768 --> 42:06.471
Whatever we do, first we wait.

42:06.473 --> 42:10.107
Give G32 a little time to relax
and let the doses kick in.

42:10.109 --> 42:12.308
Why are we waiting?

42:12.310 --> 42:14.112
We already know
that's not gonna work.

42:14.114 --> 42:16.047
What if we stagger the doses?

42:16.049 --> 42:17.647
Shoot her up only
when it's safe?

42:17.649 --> 42:19.449
It doesn't matter when
the doses are administered,

42:19.451 --> 42:21.585
nothing can survive
that much sedative.

42:21.587 --> 42:23.386
You mean nail it,
let it get pissed off,

42:23.388 --> 42:25.190
calm down, nail it again?

42:25.192 --> 42:30.861
One at a time until
they're all in.

42:30.863 --> 42:33.096
You better wipe this off
before you load it again.

42:33.098 --> 42:35.333
Okay, you made your point.

42:35.335 --> 42:37.034
All right, here's what we do.

42:37.036 --> 42:39.703
We hit her again,
gauge her behavior.

42:39.705 --> 42:41.640
Let's load these up
and get prepared.

42:42.975 --> 42:44.208
Ah!

42:44.210 --> 42:46.179
Everyone, back up.

42:47.714 --> 42:49.612
Hey, hey, man.
What are you doing?

42:49.614 --> 42:51.250
Calm down, all right?
Just calm down.

42:51.917 --> 42:54.585
Ow! Ah!

42:54.587 --> 42:56.754
Stay away from me.

42:56.756 --> 42:58.455
I'll kill you.

42:58.457 --> 43:00.723
Get outta here, you hear me?

43:00.725 --> 43:02.028
Damn you!

43:03.495 --> 43:05.696
Back up.
I'll... I'll kill you.

43:05.698 --> 43:07.198
Calm down.

43:07.200 --> 43:08.299
Calm down, okay?

43:08.301 --> 43:10.033
No one's gonna hurt you.

43:10.035 --> 43:11.736
'Cause I have the knife.

43:11.738 --> 43:13.103
Give me the knife.

43:13.105 --> 43:16.239
Just, oh, just give me
the knife.

43:16.241 --> 43:18.174
For Christ's sake.

43:18.176 --> 43:20.277
Steven! Oh my God!
Whoa!

43:20.279 --> 43:22.846
- What are you doing?
- Everybody needs to leave.

43:22.848 --> 43:24.748
Go, please!

43:24.750 --> 43:27.417
Just leave me alone.

43:27.419 --> 43:28.786
I... I'll... I'll cut her.

43:28.788 --> 43:31.121
I'm serious.
I'll cut her.

43:31.123 --> 43:33.156
You're not gonna get me.

43:33.158 --> 43:35.826
Everybody out.
Let's go.

43:35.828 --> 43:37.127
- Are you...
- Go!

43:37.129 --> 43:38.663
Are you crazy?
Not a chance.

43:38.665 --> 43:40.333
He is going to hurt her.

43:41.968 --> 43:43.433
Oh, my God.

43:43.435 --> 43:45.402
Oh, my God, no.
No, please. Please.

43:45.404 --> 43:47.340
Did you hear me?
Everybody move.

43:48.440 --> 43:49.806
Please don't do this.

43:49.808 --> 43:51.644
Shut up! Get out!

44:01.587 --> 44:03.453
They left.

44:03.455 --> 44:06.358
Now give her to me.

44:07.326 --> 44:10.228
You need to go.

44:10.230 --> 44:11.728
Leave.

44:11.730 --> 44:14.364
You're putting us
all in danger.

44:14.366 --> 44:15.900
Do you want everyone
to die here?

44:15.902 --> 44:17.634
You tried to kill me first.

44:17.636 --> 44:18.935
But, nu-uh.

44:18.937 --> 44:21.237
We're leaving.

44:21.239 --> 44:24.174
We're getting out of here.

44:24.176 --> 44:27.848
Just... give her to me.

44:37.022 --> 44:38.221
Yeah.

44:38.223 --> 44:40.223
I... I--I... I don't trust her.

44:40.225 --> 44:42.394
I don't trust you.

44:43.629 --> 44:46.897
I don't... I don't trust
any of them.

44:46.899 --> 44:49.000
I don't trust...
I don't trust her.

44:49.002 --> 44:52.069
I don't... I don't trust you.

44:52.071 --> 44:53.607
I don't...

45:04.317 --> 45:07.420
Aah!
[screaming]

45:12.625 --> 45:15.058
Must be something in
the bite affecting

45:15.060 --> 45:16.393
his cognitive functions.

45:16.395 --> 45:17.898
Something we didn't see before.

45:23.402 --> 45:25.303
We have to get back
into that room.

45:25.305 --> 45:26.536
It's the only safe place
in the building.

45:26.538 --> 45:28.304
How do you suggest we do that?

45:28.306 --> 45:29.839
We need to get to
the Pharmacology room.

45:29.841 --> 45:31.375
There's some medical
equipment

45:31.377 --> 45:32.944
and something we can use
as a weapon.

45:32.946 --> 45:35.612
Maybe we can overpower Hagen
and try to get back in.

45:35.614 --> 45:36.980
Yeah, that still
doesn't solve the problem

45:36.982 --> 45:38.716
of how we get outta here.

45:38.718 --> 45:40.451
No, but right now safety is
better than being exposed

45:40.453 --> 45:41.618
out here without eyes
on the target.

45:41.620 --> 45:42.853
If we can get the power back on,

45:42.855 --> 45:44.457
maybe we can override
the trigger.

45:46.792 --> 45:48.292
Do you hear that?

45:48.294 --> 45:50.060
I heard something.
I think it's here.

45:50.062 --> 45:52.096
- Keep moving.
- We're all on edge. It's nothing.

45:52.098 --> 45:53.531
Everything's gonna
sound like something.

45:53.533 --> 45:54.864
Let's just get to Pharm.

45:54.866 --> 45:56.132
It's okay.

45:56.134 --> 45:58.034
It's just your mind playing
tricks on you.

45:58.036 --> 46:00.272
[gasping]

46:03.276 --> 46:05.779
Smith. Smith!

46:11.283 --> 46:13.385
Jesus, this thing won't quit.

46:20.192 --> 46:21.828
Damn you, Hagen.

46:27.500 --> 46:30.402
This way. Up. Go.

46:34.105 --> 46:35.973
Where'd they go?

46:35.975 --> 46:37.542
Shh.

46:37.544 --> 46:40.277
I don't know.

46:40.279 --> 46:42.379
I wanna go back.

46:42.381 --> 46:44.281
Maybe I can reason with him.

46:44.283 --> 46:46.216
You heard Dr. Ovidio.

46:46.218 --> 46:48.018
Maybe something in the bite.

46:48.020 --> 46:51.423
He's sick.
Doesn't know what he's doing.

46:53.558 --> 46:55.361
Then what do we do?

46:57.462 --> 46:58.995
Medicine.

46:58.997 --> 47:01.198
We need to get to
the pharmacy and get some meds.

47:01.200 --> 47:04.268
Maybe we can distract
him somehow, take him down,

47:04.270 --> 47:05.969
get back into that room.

47:05.971 --> 47:08.540
It's worth a shot.

47:10.542 --> 47:12.877
We stay together.

47:12.879 --> 47:14.748
Go quietly.

47:34.500 --> 47:37.003
Subject file G48.

47:46.978 --> 47:49.245
Tox panel.

47:49.247 --> 47:53.216
Diagnostic unit inquiry.

47:53.218 --> 47:55.321
Microbial.

47:56.355 --> 47:57.790
What?

47:58.623 --> 48:00.660
Phase three diagnostic.

48:01.960 --> 48:03.663
[exhales]

48:06.631 --> 48:10.900
Three times dose level.

48:10.902 --> 48:12.571
Huh?

48:13.939 --> 48:17.944
Why are you pumping G48
full of Daleuxin, Charles?

48:19.379 --> 48:23.880
Okay, you get to
the Pharma Lab, secure it.

48:23.882 --> 48:26.350
Make sure everyone's
accounted for.

48:26.352 --> 48:27.851
I'll get to the electrical.

48:27.853 --> 48:29.319
I'll meet right back up
with you once

48:29.321 --> 48:30.687
I get the juice turned back on.

48:30.689 --> 48:32.524
It sounds like a plan.

48:33.326 --> 48:35.025
Smith, you okay?

48:35.027 --> 48:36.830
Yeah, I just gotta stop.

48:38.131 --> 48:39.565
Just for a second.

48:41.634 --> 48:44.368
Just feeling kind of woozy.

48:44.370 --> 48:45.904
I'll be fine.

48:47.605 --> 48:50.540
Yeah, your shoulder's
oozing pretty good.

48:50.542 --> 48:53.176
Need to get some fluids in you.

48:53.178 --> 48:55.178
We're not far from one
of the break rooms.

48:55.180 --> 48:57.380
We'll check the fridge for
some juice or something.

48:57.382 --> 48:59.750
Yeah, I still owe you
one for...

48:59.752 --> 49:02.389
saving my ass like you did.

49:03.955 --> 49:08.192
Can you believe that I actually
got bit by a freaking dinosaur?

49:08.194 --> 49:11.761
They definitely don't train you for
that one at the Naval Academy.

49:11.763 --> 49:13.799
Or anywhere else,
for that matter.

49:15.100 --> 49:18.136
Hey, you did everything
right back there.

49:18.138 --> 49:20.337
Yeah.

49:20.339 --> 49:23.973
But, uh, Hyde, he's, uh...

49:23.975 --> 49:27.044
Well, no, no, no, no,
we don't talk about that now.

49:27.046 --> 49:28.612
Time to grieve is later.

49:28.614 --> 49:32.216
Right now we get you
a drink and get to safety.

49:32.218 --> 49:33.685
Yeah, a drink sounds good.

49:35.087 --> 49:36.689
Maybe a whiskey, huh?

49:38.457 --> 49:40.190
Sure thing, buddy.

49:40.192 --> 49:43.460
When we get out of here a
little later today, I'm buying.

49:43.462 --> 49:45.165
Now you're talking.

49:46.565 --> 49:49.033
Say we get you vertical, okay?

49:49.035 --> 49:50.036
Yeah.

49:51.036 --> 49:53.069
Come on. Up.

49:53.071 --> 49:54.638
[grunting]

49:54.640 --> 49:56.406
God, you're warm.

49:56.408 --> 49:58.040
I think it's a fever.

49:58.042 --> 50:01.612
That's probably why it's
so chilly in here, right?

50:01.614 --> 50:03.346
All right, we're moving.
You ready?

50:03.348 --> 50:05.015
- Yeah.
- All right.

50:05.017 --> 50:06.453
Let's go.

50:13.058 --> 50:14.627
Dr. Martinelli?

50:22.435 --> 50:23.937
Diana?

50:28.107 --> 50:29.642
Hello?

50:31.444 --> 50:33.480
Anyone here?

50:38.517 --> 50:40.486
Are we the first ones
to show up?

50:53.498 --> 50:54.897
It looks like it.

50:54.899 --> 50:57.900
Looks like
she's already been here.

50:57.902 --> 51:01.207
Let's just get what
we need and get out quickly.

51:03.576 --> 51:04.940
You find anything over there?

51:04.942 --> 51:08.679
That bitch wants
to mess with me,

51:08.681 --> 51:12.015
she's damn sure going to bleed.

51:12.017 --> 51:14.518
All right,
let's get a move on.

51:14.520 --> 51:15.989
Stop.

51:17.556 --> 51:20.827
Don't move.

51:34.006 --> 51:35.406
We have to warn the others.

51:35.408 --> 51:37.373
They're all going
to Pharma to meet up.

51:37.375 --> 51:38.875
Charles?

51:38.877 --> 51:40.844
- Just a minute.
- Did you hear me?

51:40.846 --> 51:44.013
- Wait, hold on.
- Why are we stopping?

51:44.015 --> 51:46.552
- Hold on.
- I'm going.

51:47.687 --> 51:50.654
It's numbers.

51:50.656 --> 51:52.489
What numbers?
What are you...?

51:52.491 --> 51:54.024
It's the numbers.

51:54.026 --> 51:55.692
G32, I suspected she's able
to recognize

51:55.694 --> 51:57.460
the difference between
letters and numbers.

51:57.462 --> 51:59.798
That's how she's been
able to locate us.

52:06.272 --> 52:08.975
How would she
know that, Charles?

52:10.676 --> 52:13.011
What have we been doing
to these animals?

52:30.296 --> 52:33.364
We each hid
in different rooms.

52:33.366 --> 52:37.868
Perhaps G32 noticed
the placard outside of each

52:37.870 --> 52:40.404
and... and made an assumption.

52:40.406 --> 52:43.676
The rooms with numbers
are housing her prey.

52:44.910 --> 52:48.444
And the ones without
are empty?

52:48.446 --> 52:50.815
Look, it's... it's a best
guess based

52:50.817 --> 52:53.049
off the information
I've got so far.

52:53.051 --> 52:55.854
I'm not saying it's
a sound theory just yet.

52:58.089 --> 53:00.390
We don't know where
anyone else was hiding.

53:00.392 --> 53:02.995
Maybe they're hiding in...
in a closet.

53:07.299 --> 53:10.833
With all the labs and offices
to choose from,

53:10.835 --> 53:13.703
odds are the others found
shelter in those instead

53:13.705 --> 53:15.707
and those have room numbers.

53:17.743 --> 53:20.710
And G32 is making
the connection.

53:20.712 --> 53:24.181
I mean, it's not... the proper
result,

53:24.183 --> 53:26.384
but she's incorporating
a thought process

53:26.386 --> 53:29.185
for solving basic problems.

53:29.187 --> 53:32.223
G32 is starting to comprehend.

53:32.225 --> 53:34.927
I have to tell Marisa,
if we can find her.

53:50.241 --> 53:52.879
How do you know overpowering
him is going to work?

53:55.513 --> 53:57.115
He's got a knife.

54:05.424 --> 54:06.857
Shh.

54:06.859 --> 54:09.895
We don't want to draw
attention to ourselves.

54:14.466 --> 54:17.634
Can we just... go already?

54:17.636 --> 54:20.770
These lead agents have very
specific formulaic structures.

54:20.772 --> 54:23.406
I have to make sure
I get the right one.

54:23.408 --> 54:24.940
You wanna help?

54:24.942 --> 54:26.676
Come over here and find
any control numbers

54:26.678 --> 54:28.480
that begin with "IIG."

54:38.991 --> 54:42.158
We've been developing
these from the dinos.

54:42.160 --> 54:44.930
Now I'll get to see
if they work on humans.

54:48.401 --> 54:49.799
Come on. One more.

54:49.801 --> 54:51.167
[grunting]

54:51.169 --> 54:52.404
Come on.

54:53.872 --> 54:55.341
Sit you down.

55:03.582 --> 55:05.382
Thanks, Doris.

55:05.384 --> 55:07.954
Here, drink this.

55:09.455 --> 55:11.190
I'll see what else
we can find.

55:14.460 --> 55:15.762
Shit.

55:17.163 --> 55:18.498
Shit.

55:20.198 --> 55:21.832
Shit!

55:21.834 --> 55:24.000
Damn it.

55:24.002 --> 55:27.237
There's nothing else here.

55:27.239 --> 55:28.904
We need to get you to the meds.

55:28.906 --> 55:30.574
Rest of the group is
probably already there.

55:30.576 --> 55:31.607
We can meet up with them.

55:31.609 --> 55:33.211
[coughing]

55:35.915 --> 55:37.850
[scuttling]

55:42.254 --> 55:43.288
Come on.

55:44.689 --> 55:46.589
Come on.

55:46.591 --> 55:48.525
[grunting]

55:48.527 --> 55:50.496
Shh. Shh.

56:11.850 --> 56:12.882
Oh! Oh!

56:12.884 --> 56:13.917
Shh, shh.

56:13.919 --> 56:16.187
Oh, geez.

56:16.189 --> 56:17.888
Sorry.

56:17.890 --> 56:20.690
We... we thought you
were the... you know.

56:20.692 --> 56:22.658
Have you seen her?

56:22.660 --> 56:24.794
No, thank God.

56:24.796 --> 56:27.163
God, you look pretty bad.

56:27.165 --> 56:28.966
He's got a bit of a fever.

56:28.968 --> 56:30.569
I'll get you an ice pack.

56:34.973 --> 56:36.739
This will do for now,
but we need to get him

56:36.741 --> 56:38.141
to the pharmacology room.

56:38.143 --> 56:39.976
Yeah, we were just
headed that way.

56:39.978 --> 56:41.312
Plus I need to get
the power back on,

56:41.314 --> 56:43.179
see if we can't override
the system.

56:43.181 --> 56:45.683
Let's get you up.

56:45.685 --> 56:47.449
When did the fever get bad?

56:47.451 --> 56:49.652
Oh, I don't think
we have to talk.

56:49.654 --> 56:51.422
You don't want to talk?

56:51.424 --> 56:53.924
About the fever?
The fever you're running?

56:53.926 --> 56:55.895
Yes.

56:57.330 --> 56:59.529
Hey, Smitty, you okay, bud?

56:59.531 --> 57:01.130
You still with us?

57:01.132 --> 57:03.433
He's confused.
Fever's only getting worse.

57:03.435 --> 57:04.469
Feel him.

57:07.239 --> 57:08.705
Oh, man.

57:08.707 --> 57:09.973
You're burning up, kid.

57:09.975 --> 57:11.607
Come on.

57:11.609 --> 57:14.011
We'll sit you down as soon
as we get to the lab.

57:14.013 --> 57:16.712
Yeah, that's all they want.
That's all they want...

57:16.714 --> 57:18.015
He's rambling.

57:18.017 --> 57:19.850
He's not focused on
where we are.

57:19.852 --> 57:23.420
What do you want?
Where are we?

57:23.422 --> 57:25.888
- Like Hagen.
- Where are we?

57:25.890 --> 57:28.658
Charles may be right.

57:28.660 --> 57:31.027
The bite may have done more harm
than we would have expected.

57:31.029 --> 57:32.929
Who are you? Who are you?

57:32.931 --> 57:35.565
What is this? What?

57:35.567 --> 57:36.500
Go, doc.

57:36.502 --> 57:38.033
What was that?
Who was that?

57:38.035 --> 57:39.670
Hey! Hey!
What was that?

57:39.672 --> 57:40.837
- Shh.
- What was it?

57:40.839 --> 57:42.208
Come on.

57:57.857 --> 57:59.659
[shivering]

58:06.931 --> 58:08.198
Where are we?

58:08.200 --> 58:09.732
What's going on?
What's going on?

58:09.734 --> 58:13.670
Wh... wh--wh... where are we?
Where are we?

58:13.672 --> 58:15.871
Shh.
Shh. Shh.

58:15.873 --> 58:16.906
- What?
- Shh.

58:16.908 --> 58:18.174
- What?
- Just quiet.

58:18.176 --> 58:21.109
- Get away from me!
- Shut up. Shut up.

58:21.111 --> 58:23.048
[moaning and grunting]

58:24.882 --> 58:25.949
No!

58:25.951 --> 58:27.183
- I'll kill you!
- Stop!

58:27.185 --> 58:29.685
- I'll kill you!
- Smith!

58:29.687 --> 58:31.187
Will you leave me in here?

58:31.189 --> 58:32.888
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!

58:32.890 --> 58:35.491
Shut up!
You're losing your head.

58:35.493 --> 58:36.859
Stop it!

58:36.861 --> 58:38.027
You're not gonna
keep me in here.

58:38.029 --> 58:39.929
Shut up!
Not again!

58:39.931 --> 58:42.101
[grunting]

58:50.142 --> 58:52.544
[choking]

59:55.406 --> 59:58.341
What have you done, Marisa?

59:58.343 --> 01:00:00.342
None of us are
wearing any gloves.

01:00:00.344 --> 01:00:02.480
You didn't even try to warn us.

01:00:08.687 --> 01:00:12.522
Phase three parasitic
pathology analysis.

01:00:12.524 --> 01:00:16.292
Possible compromise
in bloodline.

01:00:16.294 --> 01:00:19.732
Previous subject displays
deviation at dose level.

01:00:22.968 --> 01:00:26.638
The 30 series wasn't
responding to the Daleuxin.

01:00:33.245 --> 01:00:37.980
Charles had to detect
the microbe in G48

01:00:37.982 --> 01:00:43.254
and see if the Daleuxin would
still react in their mother.

01:01:15.788 --> 01:01:18.054
These are only at
Phase Two trials.

01:01:18.056 --> 01:01:19.621
What does that mean?

01:01:19.623 --> 01:01:21.591
It means I don't know
how effective

01:01:21.593 --> 01:01:25.395
they're going to be,
but we have to try.

01:01:25.397 --> 01:01:29.198
We need to get close enough
to Hagen and inject him.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.732
Then we can give
him the medicine.

01:01:30.734 --> 01:01:32.935
Hopefully it will reverse
the effects of the bite.

01:01:32.937 --> 01:01:35.004
I don't know how.

01:01:35.006 --> 01:01:36.505
I wouldn't know what to do.

01:01:36.507 --> 01:01:37.973
Okay, I'll inject him,
but you're going to need

01:01:37.975 --> 01:01:39.442
to lure him out, okay?

01:01:39.444 --> 01:01:41.545
He's threatened to
kill me once already.

01:01:41.547 --> 01:01:43.779
Goddamn it,
this is our chance.

01:01:43.781 --> 01:01:45.482
I need to get into that
safe room

01:01:45.484 --> 01:01:47.717
so we can contact
the outside world.

01:01:47.719 --> 01:01:49.687
I need your help.

01:01:55.861 --> 01:01:56.929
I'm sorry.

01:02:50.848 --> 01:02:53.183
That's all of them except
for the testing room.

01:02:53.185 --> 01:02:54.750
Good, good.

01:02:54.752 --> 01:02:57.053
Uh, maybe we can trick her
into going back in.

01:02:57.055 --> 01:02:59.755
I mean, it's not gonna hold
her for long but maybe

01:02:59.757 --> 01:03:01.627
long enough to stop the
Halon trigger.

01:03:06.631 --> 01:03:08.433
It's just up ahead.

01:03:09.868 --> 01:03:11.100
[grunts]

01:03:11.102 --> 01:03:13.504
[shouts]

01:03:18.977 --> 01:03:20.478
[grunts]

01:03:22.614 --> 01:03:24.617
[chokes]

01:03:44.868 --> 01:03:46.471
Come on.

01:03:49.908 --> 01:03:51.607
Come on!

01:03:51.609 --> 01:03:53.711
Ah!

01:03:56.881 --> 01:03:58.181
I got you!

01:03:58.183 --> 01:03:59.716
[screams]

01:03:59.718 --> 01:04:01.687
I got you!

01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:08.491
I got you!
I got you!

01:04:08.493 --> 01:04:10.496
[panting]

01:04:16.234 --> 01:04:17.736
[whimpering]

01:04:20.305 --> 01:04:22.440
[sobbing]

01:04:34.419 --> 01:04:35.888
Eva?

01:04:53.103 --> 01:04:54.939
Come on.

01:05:06.183 --> 01:05:07.486
Baby, I'm sorry.

01:05:10.321 --> 01:05:14.125
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:05:42.553 --> 01:05:44.522
[grunting]

01:05:46.156 --> 01:05:47.992
I'm sorry.

01:06:02.841 --> 01:06:03.906
No!

01:06:03.908 --> 01:06:06.078
No, no, no, no, no!
No!

01:06:10.181 --> 01:06:11.714
<i>There has been a breach.</i>

01:06:11.716 --> 01:06:14.417
<i>All personnel to facility
safe room immediately.</i>

01:06:14.419 --> 01:06:16.185
Another one's escaped.

01:06:16.187 --> 01:06:18.788
Come on. Come on!

01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:20.690
<i>There has been a breach.</i>

01:06:20.692 --> 01:06:23.429
<i>All personnel to facility
safe room immediately.</i>

01:06:25.964 --> 01:06:27.466
Yeah.

01:06:29.334 --> 01:06:30.701
Great idea.

01:06:38.576 --> 01:06:40.342
Why are you in my office?

01:06:40.344 --> 01:06:42.911
You knew this whole time.

01:06:42.913 --> 01:06:45.647
You watched Hagen and
then Smith as they started

01:06:45.649 --> 01:06:48.083
to show symptoms.

01:06:48.085 --> 01:06:51.286
You knew we were all infected
back in the safe room.

01:06:51.288 --> 01:06:53.223
Infected?

01:06:53.225 --> 01:06:55.491
I tested the blood, Marisa.

01:06:55.493 --> 01:06:59.194
Smith's blood, he had
a severely aggressive strain

01:06:59.196 --> 01:07:02.864
of toxoplasmosis that I've never
even seen before in my life.

01:07:02.866 --> 01:07:05.801
And you acted like
you had no idea.

01:07:05.803 --> 01:07:09.906
The parasites from G32 were
spread through her bites.

01:07:09.908 --> 01:07:12.308
That blood, with the infection
so aggressive,

01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:14.544
would contaminate anyone else
who came into contact.

01:07:14.546 --> 01:07:16.212
You don't know that.

01:07:16.214 --> 01:07:19.382
I saw the sample myself,
and then I read the files.

01:07:19.384 --> 01:07:20.953
All of them.

01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:33.799
It doesn't work, does it?

01:07:34.799 --> 01:07:37.933
The immunosuppressants.

01:07:37.935 --> 01:07:39.636
Oh, it's all in there, Marisa.

01:07:39.638 --> 01:07:42.772
You and Charles pumping
elevated levels of

01:07:42.774 --> 01:07:46.509
human proteins and hormones
into all of our animals.

01:07:46.511 --> 01:07:47.978
They were showing a rate
of progress

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.444
we never could have anticipated.

01:07:49.446 --> 01:07:52.815
Until they stopped
responding to the Daleuxin,

01:07:52.817 --> 01:07:54.817
making the immunosuppressant
useless

01:07:54.819 --> 01:07:58.290
and every one of those organs
absolutely worthless.

01:08:00.991 --> 01:08:03.292
I'm going to try to get
back into the safe room.

01:08:03.294 --> 01:08:04.926
It's our only chance.

01:08:04.928 --> 01:08:07.931
We can test the suppressants
on a real subject.

01:08:07.933 --> 01:08:09.134
Hagen.

01:08:10.134 --> 01:08:12.601
Pray it works.

01:08:12.603 --> 01:08:14.806
We can do this together.

01:08:18.643 --> 01:08:21.647
Your walkie, it's lighting up.

01:08:23.314 --> 01:08:25.279
It's Charles.

01:08:25.282 --> 01:08:26.716
Do you hear that echo?

01:08:26.718 --> 01:08:28.084
I think it's coming
from the testing room.

01:08:28.086 --> 01:08:29.718
Testing room?

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:32.621
Maybe he's got her back
into her enclosure.

01:08:32.622 --> 01:08:34.693
We need to help.

01:09:10.627 --> 01:09:12.294
It's G48.

01:09:12.296 --> 01:09:14.031
She's out.

01:09:14.866 --> 01:09:16.602
It's Charles.

01:09:23.506 --> 01:09:25.841
They killed G32.

01:09:25.843 --> 01:09:27.912
She killed one of her own?

01:09:30.479 --> 01:09:32.017
No.

01:09:33.818 --> 01:09:35.316
No, I think it was Charles.

01:09:35.318 --> 01:09:38.322
Drilled two holes in the...
back of her head.

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:47.362
She was only looking for her
mother this whole time.

01:09:47.363 --> 01:09:50.702
I think she was calling out
to her before.

01:09:52.237 --> 01:09:54.704
Diana, look at him.

01:09:54.706 --> 01:09:59.107
G48 had the wherewithal for
this vindictive response.

01:09:59.109 --> 01:10:01.444
You were giving
her an excessive amount

01:10:01.446 --> 01:10:03.114
of human proteins.

01:10:05.983 --> 01:10:08.017
What you didn't expect is
for them to start

01:10:08.019 --> 01:10:10.152
acting like humans.

01:10:10.154 --> 01:10:14.088
Why are we still here then?
Let's go to the safe room.

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:17.795
She's right.
Let's go.

01:10:19.096 --> 01:10:20.862
If the blood is
carrying malignant agents,

01:10:20.864 --> 01:10:23.098
then we could all be exposed.

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:25.034
It's on all of us.

01:10:25.036 --> 01:10:29.073
If we start to show symptoms,
we have a possible option.

01:10:30.308 --> 01:10:31.574
You need to tell her.

01:10:31.576 --> 01:10:33.776
Can we hurry?

01:10:33.778 --> 01:10:36.012
You heard her.
Let's hurry.

01:10:36.014 --> 01:10:39.184
Let's get her to safety first.

01:10:55.966 --> 01:10:58.633
No pulse.
He's dead.

01:10:58.635 --> 01:11:00.669
Marisa, are you sure?

01:11:00.671 --> 01:11:02.170
Yes, I'm sure.

01:11:02.172 --> 01:11:03.972
What now?

01:11:03.974 --> 01:11:06.178
We need to find G48.

01:11:10.181 --> 01:11:12.048
- She's not in Immunology.
- What?

01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:14.217
She's not in the
Transplant Wing either.

01:11:14.219 --> 01:11:15.051
Look again.

01:11:15.053 --> 01:11:16.418
You're scrolling too fast.

01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:17.887
I'm telling you
she's not in any

01:11:17.889 --> 01:11:19.221
main department
of the building.

01:11:19.223 --> 01:11:22.591
Well, that's impossible.
Where is she?

01:11:22.593 --> 01:11:24.392
She's got to be here.

01:11:24.394 --> 01:11:25.796
She's not here.

01:11:27.599 --> 01:11:30.232
- Try camera five.
- I did. She's not there.

01:11:30.234 --> 01:11:31.534
Where is she?

01:11:31.536 --> 01:11:33.402
There she is.

01:11:33.404 --> 01:11:35.437
- Where?
- The cages.

01:11:35.439 --> 01:11:36.873
Oh, my God. Look.

01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:40.410
She can't possibly know
how to open those cages.

01:11:40.412 --> 01:11:44.946
If she does, then we can
enact Code Five.

01:11:44.948 --> 01:11:46.982
What's Code Five?

01:11:46.984 --> 01:11:49.819
There's another fail safe.

01:11:49.821 --> 01:11:51.221
The microchips.

01:11:51.223 --> 01:11:53.054
You wired the chips to
kill all my animals?

01:11:53.056 --> 01:11:55.057
We're going to avoid that.

01:11:55.059 --> 01:11:56.659
There's no need for that.
Not yet.

01:11:56.661 --> 01:11:58.160
What are you talking about?

01:11:58.162 --> 01:11:59.928
Kill them!
Do it now!

01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:02.397
Diana, if we can trap her
in her enclosure

01:12:02.399 --> 01:12:05.200
and seal the door from her side,
the lockdown will be lifted,

01:12:05.202 --> 01:12:08.204
and we can still
save the specimens.

01:12:08.206 --> 01:12:09.972
I know how you feel about them.

01:12:09.974 --> 01:12:11.973
I don't want them to die either.

01:12:11.975 --> 01:12:14.877
All of our work
will be destroyed.

01:12:14.879 --> 01:12:17.512
Please, help me save them.

01:12:17.514 --> 01:12:19.481
You did all of this
behind my back

01:12:19.483 --> 01:12:21.816
so it wouldn't hamper
progress if I found out.

01:12:21.818 --> 01:12:23.518
Methods were working.

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:26.521
We are 120 days out
from our first transplant.

01:12:26.523 --> 01:12:28.557
There is no reason why
that should change.

01:12:28.559 --> 01:12:30.426
It shouldn't change.

01:12:30.428 --> 01:12:31.793
People are dead.

01:12:31.795 --> 01:12:35.297
The PARC will want to destroy
every Goji in this place

01:12:35.299 --> 01:12:37.734
after what happened,
and it's all your fault.

01:12:37.736 --> 01:12:42.405
You have taken advantage of
these precious, rare animals,

01:12:42.407 --> 01:12:44.507
and look at what
you've done to them.

01:12:44.509 --> 01:12:46.941
Diana, I'm on your side!

01:12:46.943 --> 01:12:50.111
You and I are going
to save your dinosaurs.

01:12:50.113 --> 01:12:52.981
We can't argue about
this anymore.

01:12:52.983 --> 01:12:54.251
Hey, wait!

01:12:55.053 --> 01:12:57.352
You can't leave me here.

01:12:57.354 --> 01:12:59.722
Hey.

01:12:59.724 --> 01:13:03.226
Hey, stay here where it's safe.

01:13:03.228 --> 01:13:06.462
We'll be right back.
We're getting out of here.

01:13:06.464 --> 01:13:08.130
Okay?

01:13:08.132 --> 01:13:10.468
We're gonna get out of here.

01:13:16.172 --> 01:13:18.540
I'll need to test all
the remaining Gojis.

01:13:18.542 --> 01:13:20.810
See how many you've given
a death sentence to.

01:13:20.812 --> 01:13:22.177
I need you to listen to me.

01:13:22.179 --> 01:13:23.612
I realize the only other
option we have left

01:13:23.614 --> 01:13:25.114
is these tranqs,
but it won't be enough.

01:13:25.116 --> 01:13:26.716
Eight doses will only slow her.

01:13:26.718 --> 01:13:28.182
It won't stop her.

01:13:28.184 --> 01:13:30.219
You've been euthanizing
all the ones that were

01:13:30.221 --> 01:13:33.222
of no use to you anymore,
like G32.

01:13:33.224 --> 01:13:35.057
They've grown immune
to the sedatives.

01:13:35.059 --> 01:13:37.125
We needed an alternative.

01:13:37.127 --> 01:13:38.392
And her mother was
being held

01:13:38.394 --> 01:13:40.495
in the Kill Room
for extermination.

01:13:40.497 --> 01:13:42.198
She followed the scent.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.534
And now G48 is in
the holding pens.

01:13:44.536 --> 01:13:46.802
We need to stop her
before she figures out

01:13:46.804 --> 01:13:49.106
a way to let the others out.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.413
Power's out.

01:13:57.415 --> 01:13:59.917
She can't get in
the cages anyway.

01:14:34.417 --> 01:14:35.651
No!

01:14:35.653 --> 01:14:38.387
Get off!
Get off me!

01:14:38.389 --> 01:14:39.623
No!

01:14:41.692 --> 01:14:43.361
[grunting]

01:14:58.041 --> 01:14:59.909
If we can get to
the tranquilizers,

01:14:59.911 --> 01:15:03.078
we may be able to neutralize
her before she opens the cage.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.746
What if we can't?

01:15:04.748 --> 01:15:07.450
It's our only chance of
getting out of here without...

01:15:07.452 --> 01:15:09.087
[screaming]

01:15:17.562 --> 01:15:20.896
Marisa, the door.
The door!

01:15:20.898 --> 01:15:22.530
I have to keep
them alive, Diana.

01:15:22.532 --> 01:15:24.933
I've come too far for all
my work to be lost.

01:15:24.935 --> 01:15:26.701
- Let me out.
- I'm sorry.

01:15:26.703 --> 01:15:29.271
But when they ask questions,
it will be human error.

01:15:29.273 --> 01:15:31.507
I have to be the only one
with the answers.

01:15:31.509 --> 01:15:32.709
No witnesses.

01:15:32.711 --> 01:15:35.009
What are you talking about?

01:15:35.011 --> 01:15:38.380
When the halon comes off,
we'll all die anyway.

01:15:38.382 --> 01:15:41.484
The dinos will die, and you
will have killed us all.

01:15:41.486 --> 01:15:44.589
Not if I override the system
before that happens.

01:15:46.623 --> 01:15:47.789
No.

01:15:47.791 --> 01:15:50.959
No, you can't do this.

01:15:50.961 --> 01:15:53.795
What about human life, Marisa?

01:15:53.797 --> 01:15:56.833
Some are expendable
for the greater good.

01:15:56.835 --> 01:16:01.235
Charles, Atkins, Bridget... you.

01:16:01.237 --> 01:16:04.307
Your sacrifice will
save thousands of lives

01:16:04.309 --> 01:16:07.310
once the research
is completed.

01:16:07.312 --> 01:16:09.578
This is just a
temporary setback.

01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:11.980
Marisa.

01:16:11.982 --> 01:16:14.219
Marisa!

01:16:28.065 --> 01:16:30.100
Diana.

01:16:53.858 --> 01:16:56.725
<i>T-minus three minutes
until halon detonation</i>

01:16:56.727 --> 01:16:58.427
<i>override expires.</i>

01:16:58.429 --> 01:17:00.161
Ah!

01:17:00.163 --> 01:17:01.496
They're all loose.

01:17:01.498 --> 01:17:02.798
What?

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.799
There's a Code Five
which will detonate a chip

01:17:04.801 --> 01:17:05.968
inside all of the Gojis.

01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:08.106
- Follow me.
- Oh, my God.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:13.741
[sobbing]

01:17:13.743 --> 01:17:15.444
I killed him.

01:17:15.446 --> 01:17:17.079
- Hey.
- I killed him.

01:17:17.081 --> 01:17:18.914
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:17:18.916 --> 01:17:20.316
She locked me in.

01:17:20.318 --> 01:17:22.250
It's okay. Breathe.

01:17:22.252 --> 01:17:23.852
I killed him.

01:17:23.854 --> 01:17:26.722
No, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

01:17:26.724 --> 01:17:29.825
Are you finding anything
on Code Five?

01:17:29.827 --> 01:17:31.529
You need to see this.

01:17:35.099 --> 01:17:38.236
Look, they're attacking
each other.

01:17:39.938 --> 01:17:43.739
What?
What is this?

01:17:43.741 --> 01:17:48.377
I've never seen or heard of
this kind of behavior before.

01:17:48.379 --> 01:17:49.844
It's brutal. What...

01:17:49.846 --> 01:17:51.579
They're wild,
uncontrollable animals.

01:17:51.581 --> 01:17:53.883
They're too aggressive now.

01:17:53.885 --> 01:17:56.585
They're too much of
a risk hazard.

01:17:56.587 --> 01:18:00.222
Even if... even if
we contained them,

01:18:00.224 --> 01:18:03.225
that would be no quality
of life for them.

01:18:03.227 --> 01:18:06.962
Marisa said that there's a... she
was trying to get back in here.

01:18:06.964 --> 01:18:09.263
Maybe there's a box or...

01:18:09.265 --> 01:18:12.336
Panel. A door.
Something.

01:18:13.836 --> 01:18:16.340
There could be some kind
of remote detonator.

01:18:19.943 --> 01:18:21.178
Got it!

01:18:24.348 --> 01:18:26.848
This should be it.

01:18:26.850 --> 01:18:28.185
Okay.

01:18:30.787 --> 01:18:31.853
Red.

01:18:31.855 --> 01:18:33.457
- Turn these on.
- Black.

01:18:34.959 --> 01:18:36.924
All right, I'll hit
the light switch. Ready?

01:18:36.926 --> 01:18:38.328
Hold on to your butts.

01:18:48.206 --> 01:18:50.675
It didn't work. Why?

01:18:52.509 --> 01:18:54.812
Look. On the floor.
Zoom in.

01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:59.147
They tore out each
other's microchips.

01:18:59.149 --> 01:19:00.816
<i>Manual override has expired.</i>

01:19:00.818 --> 01:19:03.855
<i>Halon commencement

01:19:07.690 --> 01:19:10.558
We can't stop the halon, but
we might be able to speed it up.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.895
I have Martinelli's key.
We can lift the lockdown.

01:19:12.897 --> 01:19:15.263
We just need to get
to the exit before they do.

01:19:15.265 --> 01:19:17.866
<i>Emergency lockdown

01:19:17.868 --> 01:19:19.801
Bridget, no!

01:19:19.803 --> 01:19:20.971
Bridget!

01:19:30.247 --> 01:19:31.280
Wait.

01:19:31.282 --> 01:19:32.714
Watch your step.

01:19:32.716 --> 01:19:34.986
Let's go.
Move, move, move.

01:19:43.327 --> 01:19:45.330
I can hear them.
They're coming!

01:19:46.831 --> 01:19:49.699
Come on, pick it up.
We gotta keep moving.

01:19:49.701 --> 01:19:50.766
Wait.

01:19:50.768 --> 01:19:52.634
What?

01:19:52.636 --> 01:19:53.569
What?

01:19:53.571 --> 01:19:56.871
Hey, Diana.
Let's go.

01:19:56.873 --> 01:19:57.873
Where are we...

01:19:57.875 --> 01:19:59.275
Diana, what are you doing?
Come on.

01:19:59.277 --> 01:20:00.475
Diana, we gotta...

01:20:00.477 --> 01:20:01.910
- Don't touch me!
- We gotta move!

01:20:01.912 --> 01:20:03.881
- We gotta keep moving. Come on!
- Don't touch me!

01:20:05.515 --> 01:20:07.816
- Diana!
- Get off me!

01:20:07.818 --> 01:20:10.151
Come on. Stop it!

01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:41.850
What the hell was that?

01:20:41.852 --> 01:20:44.986
It's for the virus.
She should be okay.

01:20:44.988 --> 01:20:46.323
We have to go.

01:20:51.295 --> 01:20:53.027
Hurry!

01:20:53.029 --> 01:20:54.795
Come on!

01:20:54.797 --> 01:20:56.899

Wha... what are you doing?

01:20:56.901 --> 01:20:58.068
Put me down.

01:20:59.103 --> 01:21:00.668

01:21:00.670 --> 01:21:03.673
You're only the third person
to kick my ass today.

01:21:03.675 --> 01:21:05.307
What?

01:21:05.309 --> 01:21:07.042
Did they... did they get out?

01:21:07.044 --> 01:21:09.043
Not yet.

<i>Halon commencement in
