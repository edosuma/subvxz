WEBVTT

00:03.074 --> 00:04.243
<i>There we were!</i>

00:04.543 --> 00:07.779
<i>Elliot's friend Melody and I,
witnessing this moment;</i>

00:08.677 --> 00:11.805
Yes!
Oh my God, yes!

00:12.282 --> 00:15.927
Aewsome! Awesome! Uh, okay, uh...

00:16.716 --> 00:19.626
- This is so romantic...
- I don't...

00:20.808 --> 00:24.236
Ok, it's a little tight,
just... push a little harder.

00:25.766 --> 00:28.034
Uh, brought a little skin there, no problem.

00:30.333 --> 00:31.706
Here come the freaks.

00:32.262 --> 00:36.303
Just put that motherfucking ring on that
motherfrickin' finger! Frick, frick, frick!

00:36.351 --> 00:39.176
Honey, it... it needs to be resized.

00:39.574 --> 00:42.898
Ok, Keith, sweetie,
you know how I'm crazy, right?

00:42.899 --> 00:45.002
- Definitively.
- Oh, thanks goodness!

00:45.535 --> 00:48.852
Because, I'm so sorry but I just gonna
have to take back my "yes", you see?

00:48.853 --> 00:52.657
You have to understand, I have dreamt about
this moment since I was a very little girl

00:52.658 --> 00:56.041
and, the ring fit perfectly,
but I swelled up and I said:

00:56.594 --> 01:01.211
"Yes! Oh my God, yes!",
with exactly that inflection.

01:02.370 --> 01:04.041
I'll fix it.

01:04.638 --> 01:06.668
Just tell me when you want
me to ask you again.

01:07.315 --> 01:09.823
You mean that you'd let me
plan on my own proposal?

01:10.390 --> 01:11.345
Sure.

01:12.609 --> 01:13.861
Yes! Sweet!

01:14.972 --> 01:17.539
Ok, we've only got two days people.
Melody: you're on decorations.

01:17.540 --> 01:19.151
Jordan: you come out with my look.

01:19.390 --> 01:23.111
If I think at your appointment, would you
have your armpits botoxed so they don't sweat?

01:23.460 --> 01:25.549
Because, otherwise, I'm very limited.

01:25.902 --> 01:28.708
I'm open to it. Carla: you're
encharged to the guest list.

01:28.957 --> 01:31.365
Just make sure that
all of my friends are there.

01:31.366 --> 01:33.634
Uh, and nail me that bitch of radiology.

01:33.635 --> 01:36.256
She teased me for six years about
how she's gonna beat me down the aisle.

01:36.257 --> 01:40.430
- Oh, she can suck it, her and her fat neck.
- Invite fat neck, got it.

01:40.484 --> 01:44.743
If you'll point out fat neck to me I'll keep
asking why she's still single until she cries.

01:45.718 --> 01:46.654
Done.

01:47.101 --> 01:50.584
Check it. Not a drop of sweat, it's like
a hundred degrees, in there.

01:51.395 --> 01:53.863
We haven't really been introduced.

01:54.076 --> 01:55.907
Jordan.
But first smell it.

01:58.231 --> 01:59.285
Hey, sport.

01:59.579 --> 02:03.400
Sorry to hear about your
placing second into Dr. Reid thong.

02:03.519 --> 02:04.295
Sir?

02:04.664 --> 02:06.614
Well, you don't have to hide it, son.

02:07.047 --> 02:10.449
Given your history, you must be taking
her engagement pretty hard.

02:10.451 --> 02:14.465
Sadly, it's only in the movies where
the pretty girl ends up with the ugle.

02:16.171 --> 02:17.743
Huh! Can you believe him?

02:18.671 --> 02:21.019
Oh, you and Elliot did go to a lot.

02:21.020 --> 02:24.363
You two have been on and off again
more than Ross and Rachel from Friends.

02:24.446 --> 02:26.203
Pffff-lease, I'm nothing like Ross.

02:26.204 --> 02:29.606
No, of course not.
You're Rachel, she's Ross.

02:33.016 --> 02:36.877
You guys are crazy. Nobody else in this
ospital thinks that I'm upset about Elliot.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.040
Tough break, man!

02:39.388 --> 02:42.503
'tis better to have loved and lost
than to never loved at all, five!

02:43.388 --> 02:44.741
I know about lost, brother.

02:47.318 --> 02:50.662
It's like she took your heart and just...

02:50.960 --> 02:52.831
Doug, aren't you supposed to save those?

02:53.537 --> 02:54.492
Don't tell anyone.

02:54.970 --> 02:56.980
Okay. I'm gonna head over here to vomit.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:13.270 --> 03:17.767
Baby? Would you do me a favour at night
that requires no effort on your part?

03:17.922 --> 03:19.195
Sure, what is it?

03:19.434 --> 03:20.683
Would you have sex with me?

03:21.220 --> 03:24.723
Come on! We haven't had
a lacing since Izzy was born.

03:24.980 --> 03:27.010
Turk, I'm just not there yet.

03:27.159 --> 03:30.801
I mean, if you weren't emotionally ready
would you wanna have sex.

03:31.214 --> 03:33.085
Baby, I don't even understand the question.

03:33.318 --> 03:34.134
Go away.

03:35.502 --> 03:36.517
Oh, man!

03:36.518 --> 03:39.940
Mrs Shelton is the sweetest old lady
but I can't figure out what's wrong with her.

03:39.941 --> 03:43.787
She's got a muse of random symptoms:
myalgia, alopecia, rash...

03:43.788 --> 03:48.638
That is so weird. My patient,
Mr. Billbray, has the same exact symptoms.

03:48.697 --> 03:50.419
Actually, he's my patient.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.568
Jamie? You're a baby intern.

03:52.569 --> 03:55.513
Yesterday you asked me how to turn on your
stethoscope. Now go stand over there.

03:57.036 --> 04:00.498
Sorry, but this patients have something
in common, someplace they've been, or eaten.

04:00.697 --> 04:01.847
Let's go check it out.

04:04.954 --> 04:07.243
Can you immagine being married to Elliot?

04:10.337 --> 04:13.860
Darling, do you think we're pidging
the hole into thechilden?

04:16.278 --> 04:19.560
Who cares? It's not like they're ours.

04:20.077 --> 04:23.421
I'd have to find some tiny
charts and mops, but it's doable.

04:23.536 --> 04:24.929
I'll tell you what you doable:

04:25.088 --> 04:28.551
Dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dogn, doooong!

04:28.552 --> 04:29.307
Very clever.

04:29.407 --> 04:31.670
God is watching. How many times
have you got laid this year?

04:32.554 --> 04:33.340
Bagel.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.855
Who'd have thought "God is
watching" would work. Hmm.

04:39.719 --> 04:43.587
Keith and I are definitively having some post
engagement nookie tomorrow night after the proposal,

04:43.635 --> 04:45.192
Did you get me those purple ACIDs?

04:45.272 --> 04:47.510
Yes, Keith is gonna look so hot.

04:47.703 --> 04:49.347
Cool ya. Ok, I'm gonna go meet Carla.

04:51.714 --> 04:53.945
Well, it's official.

04:54.523 --> 04:57.620
I'm the only single sorority sister left.

04:58.325 --> 05:01.246
I guess it's true what they say.
The first one to be in a threesome,

05:01.294 --> 05:02.402
the last one to get married.

05:02.835 --> 05:03.959
Damn.

05:04.937 --> 05:07.264
I'm sorry, she just said that
she was in a threesome.

05:07.793 --> 05:10.522
- Damn!
- Damn!

05:10.554 --> 05:11.361
Damn!

05:11.362 --> 05:12.535
<i>Damn!</i>

05:12.992 --> 05:16.445
I just don't wanna end up like
my aunt Sheyla and get married and have a kid when I'm 50.

05:16.446 --> 05:19.248
I mean, you find a tooth in that house,
you don't know whose mouth it fell out of.

05:19.412 --> 05:19.994
Ooh.

05:20.115 --> 05:24.833
Sometimes, I wonder, you know, if I'm ever
actually gonna find someone.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.927
- You know?
- Yeah.

05:27.504 --> 05:31.484
Ok, now is it 2 girls and a guy,
or a devil's threesome?

05:32.294 --> 05:33.763
- All girl.
- Uuh.

05:34.123 --> 05:36.490
- Damn! Sorry.
- I've got to take off.

05:37.421 --> 05:40.454
Hey, I'm reviewing this new hotel
downtown tonight for work,

05:40.534 --> 05:42.252
do you wanna join? It's all commed.

05:42.701 --> 05:45.895
- I think I'll pass.
- Well, could have been fun.

05:46.692 --> 05:48.830
<i>{\an8}* Crowd is mad at JD*</i>

05:47.869 --> 05:49.108
- That guy is so moron!
- Ok!

05:49.109 --> 05:51.094
Guys! Guys! Guys!

05:51.759 --> 05:54.006
I'm sure he has an explanation, go sit down.

05:55.105 --> 05:59.286
I'm not gonna get anywhere with her, she's
got this weird posy, she'll mack with anyone.

05:59.342 --> 06:01.997
But the second you try and take it
further, she throws all the brakes on.

06:02.030 --> 06:04.052
It always ends the same way.

06:06.563 --> 06:09.789
<i>Great Aunt Judy's arm fat.
Great Aunt Judy's arm fat.</i>

06:12.388 --> 06:14.121
I'm tired of the cold showers.

06:14.153 --> 06:17.989
That was yesterday, when she was
just a confident young hotel reviewer.

06:18.438 --> 06:22.706
Today she's a sad, vulnerable,
last single-woman standing.

06:23.018 --> 06:25.180
Now you're gonna create a wonderful
memory, then secretly call me

06:25.181 --> 06:26.710
from the bathroom right after or not?

06:26.822 --> 06:31.002
Turk, you know I'd like to be the one
making "The secret bathroom call" for once.

06:31.034 --> 06:32.816
But I'm not that desperate.

06:36.715 --> 06:38.528
You ordered some "Dorian"?

06:38.978 --> 06:40.599
- Huh?
- Oh, that's my last name.

06:41.393 --> 06:43.350
Aah, it's a good one!

06:43.479 --> 06:45.517
- I thought about it all the way up.
- Come on in.

06:46.423 --> 06:47.836
<i>Oh, it's on.</i>

06:49.897 --> 06:52.120
Mrs. Sheldon, may I just say I hope

06:52.152 --> 06:54.078
to look as good as you when I'm 80.

06:54.383 --> 06:55.554
I'm 68.

06:56.236 --> 06:58.499
Did they not have some screen
where you grow up?

06:58.563 --> 07:03.530
So, to rap this up, uh, you two live
in different nursing homes,

07:03.531 --> 07:05.552
and you have nothing in common.

07:05.648 --> 07:08.858
Is there anything that you can tell us,
that will help us figure out

07:08.890 --> 07:09.788
what's wrong with you?

07:10.269 --> 07:12.307
Last week I got a new pair of shoes.

07:12.821 --> 07:16.464
That's very helpful, thank you. Now
we just go run some more tests then.

07:19.327 --> 07:21.702
Hey, so I convinced the bar-tender to give us

07:21.735 --> 07:23.709
all the booze of your party for half price.

07:24.126 --> 07:26.790
Little hitch, you're gonna have to
show some boob.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.133
Apparently mine did not
get us all the way there.

07:29.542 --> 07:30.938
He has a soft touch, though.

07:31.773 --> 07:32.574
Lovely.

07:32.895 --> 07:35.318
Oh, and Per, you were wrong.

07:35.399 --> 07:37.292
Someone is dumb enough to love me.

07:39.884 --> 07:41.697
Where is your head right now?

07:45.749 --> 07:49.569
Perry! No, it goes "Cracker, apple,
cheese".

07:49.600 --> 07:51.157
Not "Cracker, cheese, apple".

07:51.574 --> 07:54.639
I know that we're going to be married
today, Perry, but you should know this.

08:01.604 --> 08:03.417
You're gonna fry for this, buddy.

08:06.281 --> 08:08.207
Worth it.

08:08.712 --> 08:10.333
<i>Ok, you made it to the room.</i>

08:10.638 --> 08:14.105
<i>Time for the "John Dorian
3-step seduction plan".</i>

08:14.160 --> 08:17.402
<i>Step 1, make her realize you share
things in common.</i>

08:17.570 --> 08:20.875
Ooh, they have tampons
in the toiletery basket.

08:20.923 --> 08:23.155
- I love that.
- Me too.

08:23.315 --> 08:24.695
<i>Step 1, check.</i>

08:24.855 --> 08:27.776
<i>Step 2, connect with her on
a personal level.</i>

08:27.857 --> 08:30.376
So, Melody, where's home for you?

08:30.607 --> 08:34.331
Originally Akon, Ohio. But home is
where your hat is,

08:34.572 --> 08:36.706
that's something my dad used
to always say.

08:36.883 --> 08:40.525
Oh, grace, he would also say that
America is a planet.

08:40.573 --> 08:46.166
Ah, he was in a... a boating accident
and suffered some brain damage.

08:46.638 --> 08:51.694
- Brain damage is, uhm... is rarely good.
- Tore our family apart.

08:51.854 --> 08:56.059
<i>Step Two: Check. Now just remind her
she's all alone.</i>

08:56.220 --> 08:59.364
Elliot getting married. Crazy, right?

08:59.396 --> 09:02.221
I can't believe no one's ever got
down on one knee for you.

09:02.558 --> 09:05.142
I know! Cute as a button? Huh!?

09:05.270 --> 09:06.834
- Yeah, you are.
- Hey,

09:06.867 --> 09:11.103
I have to check out the linens.
Would you care to test them out with me?

09:11.255 --> 09:15.773
<i>And there it is. I could only imagine
what wonderful place</i>

09:15.821 --> 09:17.891
<i>was waiting beneath those covers.</i>

09:21.951 --> 09:26.364
Greetings, strange traveller.
Wilst thou make with me tonight?

09:27.286 --> 09:30.749
Allright! Not really sure
how it'd go about doing that,

09:30.750 --> 09:32.766
I mean, where would I put my...

09:36.273 --> 09:38.552
C'mon dong! This is a desperate mermaid!

09:38.616 --> 09:40.381
You got to hit that!

09:40.597 --> 09:44.497
Show me where to go Turk and
I'd be happy to, where is the frontdoor?

09:45.532 --> 09:48.212
- Yeah! That's a gill.
- Yeah, it is.

09:50.137 --> 09:52.673
- Bring those horns down here!
- Oh, they're coming baby.

09:52.737 --> 09:54.262
- You can handle them?
- Oh, I can handle them!

09:54.310 --> 09:55.995
- Oh yeah, you can.
- Hey! Go Turk!

09:56.075 --> 09:59.075
- That's my mermaid!
- My baaaaad!

10:01.001 --> 10:05.591
Incoming! Uhuh, UH! AH! uhuh.

10:06.473 --> 10:09.089
I would characterize
these mattress as springy.

10:09.185 --> 10:10.469
Springy.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.413
The test results of Mr.Billbray
and Mrs.Sheldon coming yet?

10:13.446 --> 10:14.553
Still waiting.

10:15.163 --> 10:17.497
Uh! What d'you think of my manicure?
I got it for the ring.

10:17.562 --> 10:18.412
Perfect!

10:19.439 --> 10:22.248
What's on today's agenda, lovey?

10:22.705 --> 10:25.947
Well, snookums, I'm first going
to check out the market,

10:26.211 --> 10:31.105
then play a few holes of golf, and then pretend
to care about under-privileged people.

10:31.121 --> 10:33.368
You know, the usual.

10:33.737 --> 10:38.680
Well, I'm off. Though, keep an eye on Lupita.

10:38.775 --> 10:41.167
I think some of the silver's gone missing.

10:43.806 --> 10:45.010
I'll talk to her.

10:46.631 --> 10:48.958
- Bye Snoggy!
- Okay, have a good day!

10:51.621 --> 10:55.745
- You've been a naughty girl, Lupita.
- Si' Señor!

10:56.090 --> 10:59.236
You're looking fine as hell today girl!

11:00.807 --> 11:02.669
Get your bum bumped!

11:02.733 --> 11:04.948
He's goaling down!

11:05.301 --> 11:09.008
I was all horny about fantasizing about
having sex with my own wife!

11:09.991 --> 11:10.910
Damn right!

11:11.447 --> 11:15.548
Oooh, poor Turkleberry,
he thinks he's got it hard!

11:15.668 --> 11:19.375
The damn internet is down! Where am I
supposed to go for a sexual gratification?

11:19.486 --> 11:20.465
My invalid wife?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.867
Great! Everything came back
negative of Mrs.Sheldon

11:25.868 --> 11:26.836
and Mr.Billbray.

11:26.868 --> 11:28.489
There must be something that we're missing.

11:28.537 --> 11:31.779
But, with you two that would
be impossible. Might I?

11:31.811 --> 11:32.918
Take a look at the chart?

11:33.384 --> 11:36.433
Well, it's not PMR, pend hypopig,
and we've already ruled malignancy.

11:39.144 --> 11:41.070
Oh yeah! That's it, toffee!

11:41.559 --> 11:43.758
Really, you two think it's that easy?

11:45.065 --> 11:48.724
Intern! Test both their patients
for this and don't you

11:48.757 --> 11:51.886
dare tell the hearty girls
what it is. Not yet.

11:52.015 --> 11:52.752
Go.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.337
- Uh! Room service is great!
- Yeah.

11:58.890 --> 12:00.752
Uh, can I have the tiny ketchup bottle?

12:00.832 --> 12:02.550
I'm planning this elaborate prank on Turk,

12:02.551 --> 12:04.908
when he wakes up and
thinks he's 20 feet tall.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.403
- Sure.
- Thanks.

12:08.502 --> 12:11.664
Allright. Can you think of
anything else we should try?

12:11.696 --> 12:13.701
I think we should try this.

12:14.495 --> 12:16.549
<i>Turk was right. He's such a good friend!</i>

12:16.646 --> 12:20.754
<i>I should get him a gift. I'llfish for what
he wants later on a secret bathroom call.</i>

12:20.906 --> 12:25.079
<i>Wait! Why am I thinking about Turk?
Okay. Start moving your hand...</i>

12:25.432 --> 12:29.379
<i>Next stop... Boobtown, population... two!</i>

12:29.443 --> 12:31.497
Whoa! You can't go to Boobtown!

12:31.690 --> 12:34.595
That, my friend, is a gated community.

12:37.836 --> 12:40.307
Oh! You're fully dressed under there!

12:41.567 --> 12:42.610
Me too!

12:43.653 --> 12:45.338
I gotta go check out the bar,
you wanna come?

12:45.835 --> 12:46.941
Sure, I'll be right down.

12:47.470 --> 12:50.308
<i>When you are in a dryspell
sometimes you have to get wet.</i>

12:50.741 --> 12:53.146
Great Aunt Judyyyyyyyyy!

12:53.675 --> 12:55.599
<i>It doesn't matter if you are married...</i>

12:56.320 --> 12:58.677
<i>If you are all talk but no action...</i>

12:59.254 --> 13:01.948
<i>Or you have a bad internet connection.</i>

13:02.381 --> 13:05.988
<i>All you can do is take solace
in the fact that no one is getting any.</i>

13:06.408 --> 13:11.410
The test results are back, and our friends
Mr. Billbury and Mrs. Shelton both

13:11.554 --> 13:14.103
will be having a round
of penicillin for their what?

13:14.392 --> 13:18.966
That's right! Their STD. Here,
have a look if you want, pelase.

13:18.967 --> 13:24.541
It turns out that our hard candy toated
super cheery grandparents both have...

13:25.022 --> 13:26.465
Syphilis!

13:27.235 --> 13:28.004
Bang!

13:28.245 --> 13:30.698
<i>Ok, maybe some people were getting some.</i>

13:30.844 --> 13:32.478
<i>But we weren't.</i>

13:35.845 --> 13:38.201
Sorry, guys! Thought I fixed that.

13:42.915 --> 13:46.661
- I can't believe they have syphilis.
- Yes, Barbie...

13:47.383 --> 13:51.279
Look, when people get old there are certain
things they are no longer able to do, like...

13:51.460 --> 13:54.463
...drive a car over 20 miles an hour
or smell like the living, but...

13:54.576 --> 13:58.729
the one thing they damn sure can do
is have sex until they croak.

13:59.186 --> 14:02.705
The fact that matters is that thanks to
a variety of male enhancement drugs...

14:02.784 --> 14:07.394
sexually transmitted diseases have increased
amongst the elderly by 300 per cent.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.398
Argh, old people sex is disgusting.

14:10.668 --> 14:11.466
Really?

14:12.154 --> 14:15.603
Because from time to time I like
to throw back to few blue bombers

14:15.650 --> 14:17.245
and head out on the town.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.486
Ok, we're leaving now.

14:19.591 --> 14:20.917
You won't go nowhere!

14:21.980 --> 14:22.942
No one will.

14:24.972 --> 14:26.696
I will have you all know

14:26.927 --> 14:32.030
that just this morning I hoisted Enid
on to the safety rail in our kitchen

14:32.089 --> 14:34.822
and we went at it like drunk monkeys.

14:35.534 --> 14:40.191
That's right. Now just soak
in that image for a while.

14:43.512 --> 14:46.046
Everybody in the room ok
with pretending that...

14:46.351 --> 14:47.195
never happened?

14:47.266 --> 14:48.838
- Yes, yes.
- Oh, me. I am!

14:51.638 --> 14:55.169
Great! I'll go tell them
that they have an STD.

15:10.109 --> 15:11.305
I hate you.

15:11.950 --> 15:12.619
I know.

15:16.401 --> 15:18.407
Different wife, same story.

15:22.231 --> 15:23.134
Hey, fellas!

15:23.920 --> 15:26.922
Here there's a steel magnolia in
room 309 that needs a little pruding.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.594
Todd, she's 68 and have syphilis.

15:29.817 --> 15:31.764
Hey, the Todd accepts all applicants.

15:31.846 --> 15:33.371
Regardless of age and disability.

15:33.942 --> 15:35.479
Well, I'm giving up on Melody.

15:36.288 --> 15:37.250
Dude, no!

15:37.661 --> 15:38.693
Man, me, I'm married.

15:38.775 --> 15:40.804
So I may never ever ever have sex again.

15:40.828 --> 15:42.259
You, there's still a chance for you.

15:42.968 --> 15:45.256
Damn, if you're gonna do it
for yourself, at least do it for me!

15:45.572 --> 15:46.206
And me!

15:46.663 --> 15:47.574
For all of us?!

15:49.604 --> 15:51.164
What? You guysare surprised I don't get any?

15:51.809 --> 15:54.120
All right, men... I'm going in!

15:54.554 --> 15:55.539
<i>Turk was right.</i>

15:55.645 --> 15:56.865
<i>I can make this happen.</i>

15:56.988 --> 15:58.947
<i>Because whether Melody
wanted to admit it or not,</i>

15:58.993 --> 16:00.825
<i>there was a definite
connection between us!</i>

16:01.103 --> 16:03.015
So, thanks for hanging with me last night.

16:04.118 --> 16:05.443
That's not me, Melody!

16:05.854 --> 16:08.446
Oh, my bad! You two could be twins.

16:08.621 --> 16:09.982
We look nothing alike!

16:10.287 --> 16:11.308
What are you, egyptian?

16:11.554 --> 16:12.516
I don't wanna hear it.

16:14.547 --> 16:15.953
God, what a day!

16:16.222 --> 16:18.674
I cannot believe we didn't figure our patients had STD!

16:19.581 --> 16:20.813
You know what should
do blow some esteem?

16:20.966 --> 16:23.347
- Go shoe-shopping.
- Yeah, but you know what?

16:23.734 --> 16:26.948
First we should have tender,
emotional sex and then cuddle

16:26.995 --> 16:29.317
- and then the shoe-shopping.
- Hmm.

16:29.411 --> 16:31.734
I'm so glad that we are married!

16:32.285 --> 16:33.352
Oh, sweetie!

16:36.520 --> 16:38.619
Life would be so much simpler.

16:42.741 --> 16:44.325
Great! You are both here.

16:45.040 --> 16:46.448
We need to talk.

16:46.626 --> 16:49.300
We were just trading stories
about our grandkids.

16:49.570 --> 16:51.623
They grow up so darn fast!

16:52.234 --> 16:53.947
They do! They sure do!

16:56.339 --> 16:58.439
Did you wanna tell us something, sweetheart?

17:00.751 --> 17:01.391
I couldn't do it.

17:01.426 --> 17:03.835
So, you are gonna need to tell them
to sleep on a love glove,

17:03.836 --> 17:05.393
and forgettin to get all freaky and doink.

17:05.464 --> 17:07.839
Oh, but don't use those words or they
won't know what you are talking about.

17:08.449 --> 17:09.820
Now, if you'll excuse me...

17:10.076 --> 17:11.858
I've got a proposal to get ready for.

17:14.193 --> 17:17.736
<i>It took everything I had in my arsenal
to get Melody to mack with me again.</i>

17:18.435 --> 17:20.536
Hey, do you wanna mack with me again?

17:20.723 --> 17:21.685
Sure!

17:22.724 --> 17:23.628
<i>This time would be different.</i>

17:23.686 --> 17:25.717
<i>The key is not going straight for her chest</i>

17:25.740 --> 17:28.239
<i>...but to start in a more
innocent area, like her hips.</i>

17:29.971 --> 17:32.235
<i>And he sneaks the landing!</i>

17:32.399 --> 17:34.616
<i>You see, ultimately
it's all about persistance.</i>

17:34.871 --> 17:36.173
<i>Stay decors and...</i>

17:36.255 --> 17:38.167
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uuuuh!

17:38.730 --> 17:41.228
You know the rules and-and
you continue to break them.

17:41.349 --> 17:43.437
I think I'm gonna give you
a lifetime macking ban.

17:43.484 --> 17:44.469
- No!
- Yes!

17:44.610 --> 17:45.537
Give me another chance.

17:45.853 --> 17:47.885
- Can you control yourself?
- Of course I can.

17:48.935 --> 17:49.827
God is watching.

17:50.120 --> 17:50.874
I can't.

17:51.203 --> 17:53.452
Who is this " God " everyone fears?

17:56.282 --> 17:57.886
Take these for me? Thank you.

17:58.352 --> 18:00.601
Hey, JD, I was wondering
if I could borrow your scooter,

18:00.602 --> 18:01.811
so I could run a few errance--

18:01.870 --> 18:03.500
He looks nothing like me!

18:03.603 --> 18:06.254
He doesn't even have any
laughter in his eyes, like, at all!

18:10.160 --> 18:11.954
Uhm, Mrs. Sheldon,

18:12.719 --> 18:13.622
Mr. Billbury,

18:14.045 --> 18:16.133
Relax, I already told'em both.

18:16.590 --> 18:19.746
And Mrs. Sheldon and Mr. Billbury
have been doing a little talking.

18:20.059 --> 18:24.047
Turns out after bridge, every sunday
night, Mrs. Sheldon has been shtooping

18:24.223 --> 18:25.009
Did I say that right?

18:25.126 --> 18:26.440
Yes, you did, sweetheart.

18:27.175 --> 18:30.929
Okay, shtooping Howard
Steinberg, who is apparently

18:30.968 --> 18:34.730
a lot more than tango partners
with Estelle Stevens, who

18:35.082 --> 18:36.537
apart from having a fake hip,

18:36.584 --> 18:39.352
is a well known hussy in
Mr. Billbury's nursing home.

18:39.563 --> 18:43.469
Uh, and Mr. Billbury likes to have a get at
all force and sing "Who let the dogs out?"

18:45.031 --> 18:46.087
I'm getting uncomfortable.

18:46.485 --> 18:47.260
Oh, you can go.

18:50.732 --> 18:53.904
I have to say, I'm very
impressed with your...

18:54.406 --> 18:55.356
vitality.

18:55.948 --> 18:58.846
Honey, let me tell you a secret about sex:

18:59.162 --> 19:01.063
it gives you vitality!

19:02.087 --> 19:02.967
Right, Perce?

19:03.683 --> 19:04.363
What?

19:05.700 --> 19:10.392
Honestly... I can't imagine how
empty life would be without it.

19:10.870 --> 19:11.820
Can you?

19:19.042 --> 19:20.063
Ok, everyone.

19:20.180 --> 19:24.157
Keith's spontanoeus proposal to Elliot
will be happening in exactly one minute.

19:24.450 --> 19:26.800
Elliot has requested
no cellphone photography.

19:26.871 --> 19:28.184
Those pictures give her a pan-face.

19:28.577 --> 19:30.254
* people agree *

19:30.932 --> 19:35.823
Ok, when she gets here, let's be quiet, and
give her our full and complete attention.

19:36.210 --> 19:38.016
I tell you what's already a full attention.

19:41.382 --> 19:43.347
Per-Per? Can I have the beer, please?

19:44.907 --> 19:45.998
Can't do, dear.

19:47.981 --> 19:48.954
Let me help you down.

19:49.573 --> 19:50.781
Good work.

19:51.016 --> 19:53.491
Hey. Let me ask you a question:

19:54.602 --> 19:56.162
You don't really seem like the...

19:56.291 --> 19:58.449
notch-on-your bed-pose-type guy,

19:59.165 --> 20:01.054
why are you trying so hard to do me?

20:01.683 --> 20:03.408
You know what? I don't even really know.

20:04.334 --> 20:05.460
<i>Actually, I did.</i>

20:06.387 --> 20:07.595
<i>I just didn't want to admit it.</i>

20:17.449 --> 20:18.176
Uh-uh!

20:18.657 --> 20:20.241
Oh-oh my God!

20:21.327 --> 20:23.196
What is all this?

20:25.719 --> 20:26.540
You know what?

20:27.505 --> 20:29.370
I'm really happy to have you in my life.

20:31.236 --> 20:31.998
Me too.

20:44.512 --> 20:45.263
Elliot Reid--

20:45.345 --> 20:46.823
No last name, I changed my mind.

20:49.227 --> 20:49.908
Elliot,

20:51.280 --> 20:52.171
will you marry me?

21:01.625 --> 21:02.622
Yes.

21:04.510 --> 21:05.988
Oh my God, yes.

21:06.426 --> 21:06.943
Awesome!

21:40.366 --> 21:42.759
<i> As I looked at all the
relationships around me,</i>

21:43.580 --> 21:45.351
<i>some that have gone on forever...</i>

21:48.783 --> 21:50.390
<i>some that were re-ignited...</i>

21:55.587 --> 21:57.464
<i>and some that had jus begun,</i>

22:00.919 --> 22:02.174
<i>I realized something:</i>

22:05.001 --> 22:06.092
<i>It should have been me.</i>
