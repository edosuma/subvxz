00:37.537 --> 00:40.665
Well, looky who's still here.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.469
My loyal Hank.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.034
By God, you look handsome today!

00:45.145 --> 00:47.170
-Well, thank you, sir.
-You're welcome.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.044
Now, I need you to do me a favor tonight.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.110
I can't tonight, sir.

00:52.218 --> 00:56.211
Peggy and I have plans.
Romantic in nature.

00:56.322 --> 00:57.311
Cancel them!

00:57.424 --> 01:00.393
You gotta run to my farm,
feed my emus for me!

01:02.095 --> 01:03.528
Here, feed them with this.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.963
-You want me to shoot your emus?
-I got no choice.

01:07.233 --> 01:11.226
Bottom fell out of the emu market
and I'm stuck on the ass of the pyramid.

01:11.337 --> 01:14.773
-But, sir--
-I want them emus dead, Hank!

01:14.974 --> 01:17.340
Make it look like a heart attack.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.110
[Peggy singing]

01:31.124 --> 01:33.786
-Hi, Luanne.
-[giggling] It's game night!

01:34.027 --> 01:37.929
I brought the mat from Twister,
the spinner from Life...

01:38.031 --> 01:41.262
most of Operation,
and a few Monopoly pieces.

01:41.568 --> 01:43.399
Can we play that? Please, please, please?

01:43.503 --> 01:46.870
Oh, I'm so sorry, Luanne,
but I made plans with your uncle tonight.

01:46.973 --> 01:48.702
I'm finally gonna cash in that...

01:48.808 --> 01:52.039
I-owe-you-one-dinner coupon
he gave me for our anniversary.

01:52.145 --> 01:55.114
But we play games together
every Friday night.

01:55.215 --> 01:56.807
Luanne, you're in college.

01:56.916 --> 01:59.180
You should meet some people
your own age.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.345
I fear I am becoming
your incredibly fun crutch.

02:02.555 --> 02:06.753
Well, I have seen a lot of signs on campus
for sorority rush week.

02:07.327 --> 02:10.262
Oh, good. Sororities are a great place
to make friends.

02:10.363 --> 02:13.890
Now, I have never had the need to join
a formal society to make friends.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.766
But then again, I've never used
a dating service or a cookbook.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.203
[giggling] I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna rush!

02:20.340 --> 02:21.364
[phone ringing]

02:21.474 --> 02:23.339
-You want me to get that?
-No.

02:23.776 --> 02:24.868
You got Peggy.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.937

02:36.756 --> 02:38.485
or more beautifully made-up,

02:38.591 --> 02:40.752
Jeez, Peggy, I'm really sorry.

02:40.860 --> 02:43.124
-Why don't you call Nancy?
-No.

02:43.229 --> 02:47.188
Ever since she stopped cheating on Dale,
everything is ""Dale, Dale, Dale.""

02:47.300 --> 02:50.326
[sighing] I guess I could call
one of my other friends, like....

02:50.436 --> 02:52.165
Like, I'll just....

02:52.772 --> 02:54.433
Luanne! Luanne!

02:54.541 --> 02:55.508

02:55.608 --> 02:56.700
Oh, damn it!

02:56.809 --> 02:58.037

[phone beeps]

03:04.817 --> 03:08.082
It's you and me tonight, Bobby.
You want to hit the air hockey table?

03:08.188 --> 03:10.918
-You got what it takes?
-I can't tonight.

03:11.824 --> 03:14.156
Joseph and I are having a guys' night out.

03:14.260 --> 03:17.195
The last time you came,
it was kind of weird.

03:20.066 --> 03:23.399
(girls)
Loig have I cherished Zeta Sigma Tau

03:23.636 --> 03:27.037
I'll pledge my love both thei aid iow

03:27.340 --> 03:30.832
So ifyou asked, I'd tell you how

03:30.944 --> 03:32.878
I love my Zeta--

03:32.979 --> 03:33.946
[Luanne exclaiming]

03:34.414 --> 03:37.645
Oh, let's sing Lady Marmalade next.
I know the words.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.724
And this is where we sleep.

03:48.828 --> 03:49.795
[laughing]

03:49.896 --> 03:51.727
Although we don't get a lot of that done.

03:51.831 --> 03:55.767
We mostly stay up late talking about
what we'd eat if we weren't dieting.

03:55.868 --> 03:57.301
Zeta Sigma Tau!

03:57.403 --> 03:58.734
Questions?

03:58.905 --> 04:03.035
A guy on the football team said that
all Zeta Sigma Tau girls were sluts.

04:03.142 --> 04:04.166
[girls gasping]

04:04.277 --> 04:07.735
Is that true?
Because I can't join if that's true.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.876
-Zeta Sigma Tau?
-Oh, my God!

04:12.118 --> 04:14.211
Kathryn, I have a question.

04:20.226 --> 04:21.887
You're a legacy?

04:21.995 --> 04:24.793
My mother and grandmother were sisters
at Texas Tech.

04:24.897 --> 04:27.627
Your mother and grandmother
were sisters?

04:27.767 --> 04:31.396
Shoot!
Your family's more messed up than mine!

04:31.704 --> 04:33.672
So, was your mother in a house?

04:33.773 --> 04:37.800
Well, she's been in a halfway house,
and in the big house.

04:40.546 --> 04:43.481
She stabbed my daddy in the back
with a fork.

04:43.583 --> 04:44.982
[all laughing]

04:47.153 --> 04:48.484
I wanna thank you guys...

04:48.588 --> 04:51.284
for giving up time
with your family and loved ones...

04:51.391 --> 04:54.224
-to help me kill these emu.
-No problem.

04:54.327 --> 04:57.728
As a professional exterminator,
I'm a killer for hire.

04:57.830 --> 05:00.890
And even though I'm a killer for hire,
I'm doing this pro boio,

05:01.000 --> 05:02.467
That means I get the bones.

05:02.568 --> 05:05.867
I know a Chinese guy
who uses them to get erections.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.269
[contents sloshing]

05:09.008 --> 05:10.168
[emus cooing]

05:13.546 --> 05:15.377
(Bill) Oh, they're beautiful!

05:23.890 --> 05:27.053
How do you like that?
It's eating out of my hand.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.927
Hello, fella.

05:33.566 --> 05:34.931
It tickles.

05:35.535 --> 05:38.003
Hank,
I can't kill something that tickles me.

05:38.104 --> 05:39.765
Cowards! Move away from the emu.

05:39.872 --> 05:40.839
[gun cocking]

05:41.407 --> 05:42.374
[exclaims]

05:51.984 --> 05:53.451
I can't do it!

05:53.686 --> 05:55.051
Yes, I can.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.712
No, I can't! It's too damn majestic!

05:57.824 --> 05:59.883
Wait, I found the strength.

05:59.992 --> 06:01.960
Oh, who am I kidding?

06:02.362 --> 06:04.227
Hey, is that one laughing at me?

06:04.330 --> 06:05.888
No, he's still being majestic.

06:05.998 --> 06:07.522
Or is he?

06:13.906 --> 06:16.932
Hey, did you just break up
with your boyfriend?

06:18.010 --> 06:19.238
Girlfriend?

06:19.345 --> 06:21.711
I just got thrown out of a stupid sorority...

06:21.814 --> 06:24.977
by a bunch of rich, stuck-up, cool girls
with great clothes...

06:25.084 --> 06:29.248
who think they're just so hot
because they don't have mamas in jail!

06:30.156 --> 06:32.021
Your mother is in jail?

06:32.392 --> 06:35.225
Wow! It's amazing that you're in college...

06:35.328 --> 06:38.388
and not trying to mug me
or sell me drugs right now.

06:38.498 --> 06:39.931
I think so, too!

06:40.032 --> 06:42.023
-I'm Jane.
-Luanne.

06:42.301 --> 06:45.668
You know who'd really get you?
The girls at the Omega House.

06:45.772 --> 06:47.933
That's where I live. Maybe it's just me...

06:48.040 --> 06:51.100
but I like being somewhere
where people aren't snooty and mean...

06:51.210 --> 06:53.644
-but they like you for who you are.
-Yes.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.476
People should be liked for who they are.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.239
You know, you'd look so much better...

06:58.351 --> 07:01.445
with your hair just thrown off
to the side a little bit.

07:03.489 --> 07:05.514
Funny bone for $400.

07:08.795 --> 07:10.228
[buzzing]

07:15.301 --> 07:17.201
I am sorry. I have done all I can.

07:17.303 --> 07:18.395
[giggling hysterically]

07:18.504 --> 07:20.301
Aunt Peggy, guess what?

07:20.406 --> 07:21.930
I'm in a sorority.

07:22.041 --> 07:25.272
This girl Jane said that
I was a natural-born Omega...

07:25.378 --> 07:27.676
and wanted me to move right in!

07:28.214 --> 07:30.648
I'll never have to waste
another Friday night...

07:30.750 --> 07:32.809
playing games with you ever again!

07:37.457 --> 07:38.446
[sensual music playing]

07:38.558 --> 07:40.048
It's done, sir.

07:40.927 --> 07:44.590
Good job, Old Top. I'll see you at work.

07:44.697 --> 07:46.289
Hey, I could use that.

07:47.333 --> 07:50.996
-Did he buy it?
-I can't believe I lied to my boss.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.635
I should have done the honest thing
and murdered the emus.

07:54.740 --> 07:58.369
Oh, look at Fuzzy.
He looks like he's driving.

07:59.612 --> 08:00.704
[rock music playing]

08:00.813 --> 08:01.871
[people chattering]

08:01.981 --> 08:04.848
-Hi, Jane.
-Luanne!

08:05.117 --> 08:08.951
This is the sad girl who drinks alone
on campus, that I told you about.

08:09.422 --> 08:10.411
(all) Wicked!

08:10.523 --> 08:12.320
I'm so glad you came.

08:13.759 --> 08:16.250
Stand back while I disarm the gate.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.227
Go on in. I'll grab your bags.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.466
Lisa, we are here to help you.

08:27.573 --> 08:30.974
I'm not Lisa. My name is Jane. Let me go!

08:31.077 --> 08:33.977
Oh, my baby, we finally found you.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.138
We gotta move.

08:35.248 --> 08:39.082
This cult has lawyers out the ying-yang,
and they know how to use them.

08:39.385 --> 08:40.647
[Luanne whooping]

08:40.753 --> 08:42.846
Omega House forever!

08:52.498 --> 08:56.195
Welcome to Omega House. I am Jane.

08:56.402 --> 09:01.032
This is Jane. This is Jane, Jane, and Jane.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.105
-What's your name?
-Bonnie.

09:03.209 --> 09:06.804
No, it's Jane.
Bonnie is the name your parents gave you.

09:06.913 --> 09:09.040
Why should they get to tell you
who you are?

09:09.148 --> 09:10.376
They don't own you.

09:10.483 --> 09:13.816
-What's your name?
-Jane.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.015
(all) We love you, Jane.

09:17.123 --> 09:19.114
We love you, Jane.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.216
We love you, Jane.

09:21.327 --> 09:24.319
Come on, guys! How about a pillow fight?

09:25.798 --> 09:27.231
Omegas rule!

09:27.333 --> 09:30.632
-You! What's your name?
-Luanne.

09:31.170 --> 09:33.331
No, it's Jane.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.204
No.

09:35.508 --> 09:38.944
She's Jane. I'm Luanne.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.146
You're making this very difficult, Jane.

09:42.381 --> 09:45.282
Here's a little trick I use
to remember my name.

09:45.384 --> 09:49.980
Okay, I think of a man named Lou,
and then a woman named Anne.

09:50.156 --> 09:52.886
They meet in a kingdom in the forest.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.052
[Dale exclaiming]

09:58.164 --> 10:01.395
God, that is the worst-smelling feces
I've ever smelled.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.426
[sighing]
We've got to get rid of these emu...

10:03.536 --> 10:06.505
before Mr. Strickland finds out
I lied to him.

10:07.139 --> 10:09.505
No. They're so cute.

10:09.675 --> 10:12.109
How could anybody hurt something
so huggable?

10:12.211 --> 10:13.178
[emu cooing]

10:13.312 --> 10:17.112
Who's a good emu? Who's a good--
Oh, God!

10:18.084 --> 10:19.711
Don't let them get away!

10:19.819 --> 10:21.013
[all clamoring]

10:23.723 --> 10:25.623
(Dale) There's one! I got him!

10:26.292 --> 10:27.259
[exclaiming]

10:28.327 --> 10:29.294
[groans]

10:37.603 --> 10:40.003
Why does everything I love
run away from me?

10:40.106 --> 10:43.041
Because you have to pet everything
like an idiot!

10:47.013 --> 10:48.105
Hank, guess what?

10:48.214 --> 10:50.546
I'm thinking about
rekindling some old friendships.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.949
I'm gonna call everyone who wrote
""Have a nice summer"" in my yearbook...

10:54.053 --> 10:56.715
and tell them how it went.
You want to join me?

10:57.189 --> 11:00.056
Sorry, Peggy. I've already got plans. I....

11:00.159 --> 11:02.753
I'm making Bobby a hammock. Yeah.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.860
This rope should work.

11:04.997 --> 11:08.455
Who was that girl I used to make fun of
in high school?

11:09.268 --> 11:11.031
Beth Berkovski, yes!

11:16.575 --> 11:18.941
Hey, Bersnotski! Guess who this is.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.643
Good morning, Omegas.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.413
Rice for breakfast?

11:27.219 --> 11:28.914
We had rice for dinner.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.888
I'm losing weight
'cause I haven't had any meat!

11:31.991 --> 11:34.619
And I lose weight in my chest first.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.558
You think you are hungry, but you're not.

11:37.663 --> 11:41.463
Your body lies to you,
just like your parents!

11:41.567 --> 11:45.469
But you can trust us.
We will tell you when you're hungry.

11:45.604 --> 11:48.004
We will tell you when you're tired.

11:48.107 --> 11:50.769
Will you tell me
if I have to go to the bathroom right now?

11:50.876 --> 11:54.778
Because I feel like I do. But a lot of times,
when I get there, I don't.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.043
-And I just sit there and hum--
-No! No bathroom!

11:58.150 --> 12:00.209
Number one and number two
is something you did...

12:00.319 --> 12:02.583
before you became an Omega.

12:02.755 --> 12:07.522
We are going to take you someplace
where you only go number three.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.695
It's called the Omega Ranch.

12:09.795 --> 12:12.355
This must be
where we're going for spring break!

12:12.465 --> 12:14.194
The ranch is quiet and secluded...

12:14.300 --> 12:18.031
so you can concentrate on making
our famous jams and jellies.

12:18.137 --> 12:19.604
They're so delicious...

12:19.705 --> 12:24.005
especially when smeared
on a piping hot English muffin.

12:26.145 --> 12:27.635
[all exclaiming]

12:27.747 --> 12:31.274
The ranch is also
where you'll get to meet Jane.

12:32.618 --> 12:33.778
[knocking at door]

12:33.886 --> 12:35.114
How's it going, ladies?

12:35.221 --> 12:38.384
I have a large meat-lover's pizza
for Luanne.

12:38.958 --> 12:39.982
Me!

12:40.593 --> 12:42.254
You have an independent streak...

12:42.361 --> 12:45.455
that makes it very difficult
for us to love you!

12:45.664 --> 12:47.495
(Jane) Do you like it here?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.625
Well, it's cold.

12:49.835 --> 12:53.293
And you won't let me sleep.
And you locked me in a closet.

12:53.405 --> 12:56.067
But I've made a lot of new friends, so, yes!

12:56.175 --> 13:00.339
I can assign you 10 friends for life, or zero.
It's up to you.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.544
Do you understand?

13:03.816 --> 13:06.876
I said, do you understand?

13:08.487 --> 13:10.853
Boy,
if that guy on the bicycle hadn't hit it...

13:10.956 --> 13:13.891
I don't know
if we ever would have caught this fella.

13:13.993 --> 13:15.824
Jams and jellies!

13:16.128 --> 13:18.494
Get your spreadable fruitsies!

13:18.597 --> 13:20.622
-Luanne?
-Uncle Hank!

13:22.201 --> 13:26.433
If they catch me talking to you,
they'll throw me in the closet again!

13:26.806 --> 13:29.138
Yes, sir. We have blueberry.

13:29.241 --> 13:31.368
I'm so tired and hungry.

13:31.644 --> 13:35.011
Tastes delicious
on muffins, bagels, or crackers.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.775
And they haven't let me pee-pee
in two days.

13:37.883 --> 13:40.647
I think they're trying to drive me crazy!

13:40.753 --> 13:41.913
Are you drunk?

13:42.021 --> 13:46.617
If your sorority has to sell jelly
to buy beer, you're drinking too much.

13:46.725 --> 13:48.852
Now get in the back. I'm taking you home.

13:48.961 --> 13:50.155
[giggling nervously]

13:51.063 --> 13:54.726
And, no, you are not tripping.
That is an emu.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.156
[grunts]

13:56.268 --> 13:58.998
-Go, go, go!
-Hey! Kidnap! Kidnap!

14:01.974 --> 14:05.068
They'd wake me up in the middle
of the night just to yell at me.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.610
They must really hate me.

14:06.712 --> 14:09.738
Oh, Luanne, all sororities do hazing.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.079
The harder it is,
the stronger the friendships.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.709
Why do you think
POWs are always having reunions?

14:14.820 --> 14:18.722
I just opened the garage door
and something big and feathery ran out.

14:18.824 --> 14:20.052
Oh, God!

14:20.326 --> 14:23.090
I said I wanted a pony!

14:23.329 --> 14:27.356
Luanne, have you ever wondered
why I spend every Friday night with you?

14:27.466 --> 14:30.594
Because I challenge you
with my intellectual.

14:30.769 --> 14:33.237
It is because I never joined a sorority.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.603
I never got the chance
to make lifelong friends...

14:35.708 --> 14:38.302
who might drop by
to drink flavored coffees...

14:38.410 --> 14:41.140
dish about boyfriends
and my beauty secrets.

14:41.247 --> 14:44.739
Now, it's not like I am without people
I recognize at the supermarket...

14:44.850 --> 14:47.045
but that's just not the same.

14:47.586 --> 14:50.578
Now, come on, get in the car.
I'm gonna take you back.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.617
I don't know who she is.
We've never seen her before.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.161
Please! Just give Luanne another chance!

14:57.263 --> 15:01.029
I didn't like your jam at first,
but I gave it a second chance.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.601
So, you brought her back?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.805
How would you like
to come in for some rice?

15:08.707 --> 15:12.006
As an organization
that promotes love and unity...

15:12.111 --> 15:15.911
Omega House appreciates a mother
as caring as you are.

15:17.016 --> 15:20.474
I am too young to be Luanne's mother.
I am her aunt.

15:20.619 --> 15:23.179
I wish I could jump in your head
and crawl around.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.951
-Well.
-You seem like a fascinating individual.

15:26.058 --> 15:30.461
-You are probably very popular.
-Actually, no.

15:30.562 --> 15:33.554
It's like I was trying to tell this guy
in the soup aisle yesterday.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.894
I call him ""Soupy.""

15:35.000 --> 15:37.992
It's difficult to find people
you can really connect with.

15:38.103 --> 15:42.062
Well, people of high intellect
often intimidate people.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.243
And you are of high intellect, Peggy...

15:45.344 --> 15:48.040
no matter what you've been told
by your husband.

15:48.314 --> 15:49.338
No.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.178
-Your father.
-Not really.

15:53.085 --> 15:54.074
Mother.

15:54.186 --> 15:56.245
[gasps] How did you know?

15:56.355 --> 15:58.118
Because we love you!

15:58.223 --> 16:00.350
(all) We love you, Jane.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.188
We love you, Jane.

16:05.597 --> 16:08.327
Okay, so we'll have your tanks filled
by tomorrow.

16:08.434 --> 16:12.336
Now, would you mind answering
our customer-service survey?

16:12.705 --> 16:16.937
Have you seen any emu in your yard
or adjoining property?

16:17.743 --> 16:20.337
Hank! I need you to dig up them emu...

16:20.446 --> 16:22.505
and drop them off
at my insurance company.

16:22.614 --> 16:26.243
Dang pencil-pushers won't pay my claim
without the corpus delicti,

16:26.352 --> 16:29.082
Apparently my grief ain't proof enough.

16:29.621 --> 16:30.952
[phone ringing]

16:31.957 --> 16:32.946
Hello?

16:33.058 --> 16:34.457
Hank, great news.

16:34.560 --> 16:38.758
My new best friend Jane took Luanne back
and invited me to sleep over.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.228
-I didi 't have a iightgowi,,,
-Hank!

16:40.332 --> 16:43.130
,,,but the Omegas gave me a jumpsuit
just like all the other girls,

16:43.235 --> 16:44.202
[Dale yelling]

16:44.603 --> 16:48.437
Oh! God dang it, I gotta run!
Have fun, Peggy.

16:49.908 --> 16:51.500
You know what I love about this place?

16:51.610 --> 16:53.805
Nobody ever gets tired
of hearing about me.

16:53.912 --> 16:56.107
My hobbies, favorite movies...

16:56.215 --> 16:59.446
my deep-seated resentment
towards my soul-crushing mother.

16:59.551 --> 17:03.112
-I never want it to end.
-lt never has to end, Aunt Jane.

17:03.689 --> 17:08.148
See, once we get to the ranch,
it's gonna be so beautiful and peaceful.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.188
Just like a tanning bed.

17:10.295 --> 17:12.455
You know, at first I thought I was dizzy
from hunger.

17:12.564 --> 17:15.031
Now I realize it is from bliss.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.096
Okay. We'll take two of the strip steaks...

17:19.204 --> 17:23.140
three pounds of the ground chuck,
and four emus.

17:24.343 --> 17:27.972
-Oh, and could we get them shot, please?
-Sorry. We don't carry emu.

17:28.079 --> 17:31.413
Okay. Give me 75 pounds of beef.

17:31.717 --> 17:35.050
And you got any extra beaks
you could throw in there?

17:35.154 --> 17:37.349
Don't worry, Hank. I got some beaks.

17:39.625 --> 17:40.649
(Hank) How about this?

17:40.759 --> 17:44.160
We didn't want to cruise around town
with a truckload of dead emus...

17:44.263 --> 17:46.493
so we had them butchered and packaged.

17:46.598 --> 17:48.395
Mr. Strickland will buy that, right?

17:48.500 --> 17:51.469
-Bill believed you, and he was there.
-Yeah.

17:52.104 --> 17:55.801
But how am I gonna explain
a $400 meat bill to Peggy?

17:56.108 --> 17:57.973
It's not even a three-day weekend.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.945
It's a good thing she's on her
ladies' sleepover at the Omega House.

18:02.047 --> 18:03.674
Omega House, huh?

18:03.782 --> 18:06.751
I exterminated
over at the Omega House once.

18:07.186 --> 18:10.212
It's a cult, you know.
They paid me in jams and jellies.

18:10.322 --> 18:14.224
What are you babbling about?
Omega House is Luanne's sorority.

18:14.326 --> 18:16.817
What I'm babbling about is
how the Omega cult...

18:16.929 --> 18:19.955
recruits unsuspecting young women
from campus...

18:20.065 --> 18:22.590
deprives them of protein, bathrooms...

18:22.701 --> 18:25.226
and all contact
with their families and friends...

18:25.337 --> 18:28.795
then ships them off to a ranch
for general enslavement.

18:29.141 --> 18:30.631
Oh, God! Peggy!

18:34.012 --> 18:36.276
Excuse me. Are y'all with the cult?

18:36.381 --> 18:37.871
We're not a cult.

18:37.983 --> 18:40.451
We're an organization
that promotes love and--

18:40.552 --> 18:42.144
Yeah, this is it.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.655
Peggy! Luanne!
It's me, your husband and your uncle!

18:50.462 --> 18:52.987
We don't have any Peggys or Luannes.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.862
You're thinking
of Blonde Jane and Old Jane.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.833
And they don't wanna see you.

18:58.537 --> 18:59.526
[grunts]

18:59.638 --> 19:01.265
Peggy! Luanne!

19:03.075 --> 19:06.636
-Old Jane! Blonde Jane!
-It's too late.

19:06.745 --> 19:08.940
They've been deprived of protein so long...

19:09.047 --> 19:11.845
that their bodies are feeding off
their own brains!

19:11.950 --> 19:14.976
They're nothing
but soulless autonomatonamatons.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.054
[beer cans opening]

19:16.822 --> 19:17.789
[boys exclaiming]

19:17.923 --> 19:19.982
Booya! You drink.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.151
This is a job for meat.

19:34.706 --> 19:35.673
[all chanting]

19:35.774 --> 19:36.763
Janes, the bus is here.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.537
Leave everything
from your old lives behind.

19:39.645 --> 19:41.909
Except work gloves. You'll need those.

19:43.148 --> 19:44.137
[exclaims]

19:44.249 --> 19:47.650
My arm! It's cramping! I'm down!

19:48.153 --> 19:51.316
Dang it, Dale! My wife is in there.
Keep fanning.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.324
[groaning]

19:55.060 --> 19:56.550
[chanting continues]

19:56.662 --> 20:00.928
Peggy! You can't get on the bus!
Trust me, you joined a cult!

20:01.066 --> 20:03.899
(all) Jam, jelly. Jam, jelly.

20:04.002 --> 20:06.493
Jam, jelly. Jam, jelly.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.200
(Hank) Come on. Come on!

20:10.776 --> 20:12.141
(girl) I love it.

20:12.744 --> 20:16.145
No! Do not listen to that he-person!

20:16.248 --> 20:19.411
He is on the wrong side of the love fence!

20:21.520 --> 20:25.081
This man looks like
he could use some jam and jelly.

20:28.026 --> 20:29.459
I'm sorry, Hank.

20:29.561 --> 20:34.396
My new friends have invited me
to spend eternity, I think, with them.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.365
Well, all right. Have fun, then.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.797
But maybe you'd like a bite for the road.

20:45.611 --> 20:47.841
Old Jane, get back here!

20:47.946 --> 20:51.313
My name is not Jane. My name is Peggy!

20:51.750 --> 20:53.684
And I love meat!

20:54.553 --> 20:55.542
[sniffing]

20:55.654 --> 20:58.020
Can you smell that? Can you?

20:58.123 --> 21:00.489
Look! That guy's giving out food!

21:00.592 --> 21:03.254
I'm sorry! I'm just so freaking hungry!

21:08.734 --> 21:10.599
This one tickles, too.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.802
That's funny. I can't remember my name.

21:16.908 --> 21:19.308
I think it starts with an ""R.""

21:22.547 --> 21:25.812
Wait. It's Luanne.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.512
Janes, come back!

21:31.623 --> 21:32.590
[all exclaiming]

21:32.691 --> 21:34.989
Jam, jelly. Jam, jelly.

21:35.093 --> 21:38.256
Jam, jelly. Jam, jelly!

21:38.363 --> 21:39.330
[Peggy exclaiming]

21:40.132 --> 21:41.759
Janes, come back!

21:47.005 --> 21:48.097
What....

21:48.206 --> 21:49.173
[Strickland screeching]

21:58.817 --> 22:01.650
[emus cooing]

22:28.413 --> 22:31.143
