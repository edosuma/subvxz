00:02.068 --> 00:03.503
[street sounds]

00:03.570 --> 00:05.305
[Lauren] Ah, that's it!

00:06.000 --> 00:08.708
Ah, Ahhh!

00:08.775 --> 00:10.310
Ohhh!

00:10.377 --> 00:11.878
Oh yeah!

00:12.000 --> 00:13.113
Oh yes!

00:13.179 --> 00:14.547
Oh don't stop.

00:16.383 --> 00:17.584
Oh I said "Don't stop".

00:18.000 --> 00:19.185
-[man] Oh yeah.
-[Lauren] Thank you.

00:19.252 --> 00:20.653
-[Lauren] You okay?
-[man] Yeah, yeah.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.855
[Lauren] Okay, good then.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.959
[Lauren moans]

00:26.025 --> 00:27.160
Yes!

00:27.227 --> 00:29.829
Yes, yes, yes!

00:30.000 --> 00:31.097
[door slams open]

00:31.164 --> 00:32.999
[Lauren] No, no,
stop, stop, stop.

00:33.066 --> 00:33.933
Stop!

00:34.000 --> 00:35.301
[man] I thought
you said don't stop.

00:36.000 --> 00:36.302
There's people coming.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.471
[Lauren] Oh, ah...

00:42.000 --> 00:42.909
Should we move this
back to my place?

00:42.976 --> 00:44.744
Why? What for?

00:45.145 --> 00:46.446
To finish what we started.

00:46.513 --> 00:47.714
Oh, I'm good, thank you.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.017
What? Um, what about me?

00:51.084 --> 00:52.886
Oh, thank you so much Jason.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.588
Nice to meet you. Take care.

00:55.655 --> 00:56.856
It's Andy.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.429
# I'm like a candle burning
End to end #

01:02.796 --> 01:04.164
Bit of al fresco dining.

01:06.000 --> 01:06.032
Yeah, bloody freezing.

01:06.099 --> 01:08.802
Hmm, I mean it is winter.
We do have winter in Australia.

01:08.868 --> 01:10.904
The wind chill was quite
numbing down below.

01:12.000 --> 01:12.105
Right! Lovely. Thank you.

01:12.172 --> 01:13.206
And it was Andy right?

01:13.273 --> 01:16.443
Andy was it? No, no, no.
Andy, Andy, Andy.

01:16.509 --> 01:17.777
8pm, Palais Theatre.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.546
That's what it says in the
spreadsheet, and in the diary.

01:19.612 --> 01:20.547
You sure it was Andy?

01:20.613 --> 01:23.216
Yep, here we go. Andy 32.
Finance manager.

01:24.000 --> 01:24.551
-Hmm.
-What he look like?

01:24.617 --> 01:26.453
-Tall.
-Right.

01:26.519 --> 01:28.822
-Well it was quite dark.
-Show me on his profile.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.557
Um, there it is.

01:31.157 --> 01:34.327
-Oh yeah, Andy, Andy.
-Couldn't be clearer A-N-D-Y.

01:34.394 --> 01:35.428
-Andy.
-Yes.

01:36.000 --> 01:36.396
Yeah well I was rushing

01:36.463 --> 01:37.831
because Jake was late
picking up the kids.

01:37.897 --> 01:39.466
Jake was late?
Or you were late?

01:39.532 --> 01:41.000
I should double check their
names though, you are right.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.703
You know what, let's add
photos to the spreadsheet.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.504
Yes!

01:44.571 --> 01:45.505
Like a little hyperlink...

01:45.572 --> 01:47.307
A little photo, hyperlink?

01:48.000 --> 01:48.241
Yeah, tech stuff.

01:48.308 --> 01:49.843
Okay. So is he
worth a repeat?

01:49.909 --> 01:50.710
Maybe.

01:50.777 --> 01:51.945
Marks out of ten?

01:52.011 --> 01:53.813
Six and a half,
maybe seven for effort.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.683
That's more of a 'yes'
than a 'maybe'?

01:56.749 --> 01:57.884
Maybe. Do we have
a 'maybe' tab?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.686
I will add one.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.455
Okie dokie,

02:02.522 --> 02:04.390
now we got to file the
paperwork for the Morgan case,

02:06.000 --> 02:06.593
and we've got a 9am tomorrow
with Mr Griffin.

02:06.659 --> 02:08.094
All right, and tonight?

02:12.000 --> 02:12.198
Ah tonight it is Hayden, 33,
ex-rugby player.

02:12.265 --> 02:13.766
Bar Margaux, 8pm.

02:13.833 --> 02:15.602
Bar Margaux?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.339
Are you going on a, um, a date?

02:19.405 --> 02:21.574
Ah, well yeah, sort of.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.843
Oh, so you and Jake are
definitely over?

02:24.000 --> 02:24.844
Hmm.

02:24.911 --> 02:26.713
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't be.

02:26.779 --> 02:28.081
Gee whiz you're brave.

02:28.147 --> 02:29.549
Isn't she brave?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.851
-Yes, very much so.
-Am I? Am I brave?

02:31.918 --> 02:34.320
Yes. All those apps,
you know,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.191
competing with girls half your
age and they've all got the...

02:38.258 --> 02:39.826
..face and you know.

02:42.000 --> 02:42.428
Well I don't think I'm
competing.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.331
It must be so hard,
so hard, all that rejection.

02:45.398 --> 02:46.966
There's actually not
that much rejection...

02:48.000 --> 02:49.636
Well I say good for you,
looking for the one.

02:49.702 --> 02:52.138
Well I'm not. Been there, tried
that. Gave me indigestion.

02:52.205 --> 02:53.172
Well no, the next one.

02:54.000 --> 02:54.641
-Yeah.
-Anyone.

02:54.707 --> 02:56.075
[laughs] Anyone.

02:56.142 --> 02:57.977
-As long as you're happy.
-I am, yeah.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.113
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

03:00.179 --> 03:03.216
[upbeat music]

03:07.453 --> 03:10.189
I've played professional
rugby for five years.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.357
Wow, wow.

03:12.000 --> 03:12.725
What position did you play?

03:12.792 --> 03:13.960
Blind-side winger.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.496
Gosh, that's lovely.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.699
Yeah, so I left London,
my contract ended

03:19.766 --> 03:23.069
and then I came back here
and I had a bit of downtime

03:24.000 --> 03:26.706
and I started teaching the
kids.

03:26.773 --> 03:27.507
Oh.

03:27.574 --> 03:28.341
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

03:28.408 --> 03:29.175
P.E.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.643
-Oh, P.E.
-Yeah.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.278
-Uh, Hayden?
-Yeah.

03:32.345 --> 03:33.479
I don't care.

[Lauren moaning]

04:00.740 --> 04:04.410
Well, that was the best
first time I've ever had.

04:06.000 --> 04:06.045
Yeah, it was very nice.

04:06.112 --> 04:07.880
Look I don't have to
rush off if you want to.

04:07.947 --> 04:10.249
Sorry, I've got an early start.

04:12.000 --> 04:12.685
Ah, another time.
When are you free?

04:12.752 --> 04:14.854
Well, I'll just check my
spreadsheet, um...

04:15.755 --> 04:17.023
I'll get back to you.

04:18.000 --> 04:18.591
No worries.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.493
-Give me a buzz.
-I will.

04:24.230 --> 04:26.299
[uplifting music]

04:31.237 --> 04:32.739
Over to you now, Lauren.

04:36.000 --> 04:36.576
Okay, so we settled out of
court in the Cameron case

04:36.643 --> 04:38.378
which I think was a good
result.

04:42.000 --> 04:42.615
And in other news, Alex and I
landed a lucrative new client

04:42.682 --> 04:44.751
this week, Mr. Hilton.

04:48.000 --> 04:48.054
In fact, Alex was instrumental
in bringing him in,

04:48.121 --> 04:50.657
so congratulations, Alex.
[phone ringing]

04:50.723 --> 04:53.292
I'm sorry, I'm going to have
to get this, it's the school.

04:54.000 --> 04:54.494
Please.

04:54.560 --> 04:55.528
Well done.

04:55.595 --> 04:56.763
Thank you.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.698
Lauren Davis, everything okay?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.669
Yeah, I'm actually at work,
do you mind calling her dad?

05:06.000 --> 05:06.072
He's engaged, okay, yeah, put
her through.

05:07.373 --> 05:08.474
Sorry, sorry.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.677
Hey baby.

05:12.000 --> 05:12.078
Yeah, no seriously, I'm...

05:12.145 --> 05:13.613
Cook And Cook partners
at law, Simon speaking.

05:13.680 --> 05:17.116
Okay, calm down, calm down,
now breathe.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.254
Uh, hello, sorry to interrupt.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.723
Lauren, your husband's
on the phone.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.958
Oh yeah, ex-husband.

05:26.025 --> 05:26.993
He just said it
was really urgent.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.928
Okay, sorry, do you mind
if we put him through?

05:30.000 --> 05:30.563
-No.
-I'm so sorry.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.366
No, I don't have time,
I'm at work, okay?

05:33.433 --> 05:35.568
[sings] Wash your hands,
wash your hands.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.737
-Hello Jake.
-Jake, yes, it's daddy.

05:37.804 --> 05:40.206
[Jake] Hello, Loz, Loz, hey,

05:42.000 --> 05:42.508
I was just wondering if
you've seen my goggles?

05:42.575 --> 05:45.078
No, no, I haven't
seen your goggles.

05:45.144 --> 05:46.312
No we're not going
swimming darling.

05:48.000 --> 05:48.247
[sings] Wash your hands,
wash your hands-

05:48.314 --> 05:50.083
[Jake] The blue ones-

05:50.149 --> 05:51.784
[Lauren hangs up phone]

05:54.000 --> 05:55.388
Yeah, yeah,
she's going to wash her hands.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.626
So Alex, do you want
to fill in the details?

06:00.693 --> 06:01.561
[Alex] Yes, absolutely.

06:01.627 --> 06:02.995
I think that's a great sign.

06:03.062 --> 06:05.331
Jake's reaching out,
that's great.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.202

06:18.000 --> 06:18.144
Oh, hello.

[camera clicking]

06:36.000 --> 06:36.629
[window knocking]

06:40.233 --> 06:41.801
-Hello.
-Hi, hello.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.402
Just thought I'd warn you
against using your phone

06:43.469 --> 06:44.337
when driving.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.606
Oh, I wasn't actually using it.

06:48.000 --> 06:48.875
It's a hefty fine
and the demerit points.

06:48.941 --> 06:50.543
I'm not actually driving.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.246
Well you were in a vehicle
with the engine running.

07:00.753 --> 07:01.521
Oh!

07:01.587 --> 07:02.855
It's Tuesday,
why are you here?

07:02.922 --> 07:04.590
Oh, I thought you were.

07:04.657 --> 07:05.525
Bye!

07:06.000 --> 07:07.693
Lola, Abby, woo-hoo!

07:08.394 --> 07:09.262
Daddy!

07:09.328 --> 07:10.930
Oh my gosh, what is that?

07:12.565 --> 07:14.534
Hey ah, didn't you say
you're in court?

07:14.600 --> 07:16.302
-That is tomorrow.
-In mediation?

07:16.369 --> 07:17.303
It is in the calendar.

07:18.000 --> 07:18.104
[Jake] Yeah?

07:18.171 --> 07:19.539
Guys, I borrowed a new book.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.008
It's the, wait, what is it?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.913
It's the Encyclopaedia of the
Roman Empire, wow Lola, that's-

07:26.979 --> 07:29.682
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's with the avocados?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.251
I got them on special, you
should grab some. The calendar?

07:32.318 --> 07:34.253
The shared calendar, in the
phone, I don't need them.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.454
Well, I mean,
the girls can have them.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.259
No, it's really, no thank you,
oh God almighty.

07:40.326 --> 07:41.427
I got 'em, I got 'em.

07:42.000 --> 07:42.862
Oh, you want one?

07:42.929 --> 07:43.763
Mind your head.

07:44.964 --> 07:45.765
Okay.

07:45.832 --> 07:46.632
Thank you.

07:46.699 --> 07:47.466
Bye!

07:48.000 --> 07:48.267
Bye Dad!

07:48.334 --> 07:49.101
Bye darling!

07:49.168 --> 07:49.969
Toodle-doo!

07:50.369 --> 07:51.671
Hey Loz, can you keep an eye
out for my goggles, please?

07:51.737 --> 07:52.738
-Bye!
-Okay.

07:54.000 --> 07:54.407
Mum, I'm doing the opening song

07:54.473 --> 07:56.142
at the Earth Aware
fair tomorrow.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.110
Oh, that's right,
I'm in mediation,

07:58.177 --> 07:59.579
but what time
does it start again?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.715
Half three, everyone else's
mums will be there,

08:02.782 --> 08:04.283
how come you never
come to things?

08:04.350 --> 08:05.351
I said, I'll try.

08:06.000 --> 08:06.419
You always say that.

08:06.485 --> 08:09.288
Abbs, I'm in mediation,
it's not that simple.

08:09.355 --> 08:10.957
Then ask for an adjournment.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.326
[phone chimes]

08:14.026 --> 08:15.995
Abs, can I have
my phone, please?

08:18.000 --> 08:18.998
It's from 'Charlie Beard BDSM',
it's a photo message-

08:19.065 --> 08:20.099
Don't open it!

08:20.166 --> 08:21.868
Give me the phone,
give me the phone!

08:21.934 --> 08:23.369
Please, thank you.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.238
[Abby] What's BDSM anyway?

08:25.304 --> 08:27.206
Absolutely nothing you
will ever need to know.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.108
[police siren]

08:31.510 --> 08:33.980
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.350
Hey, good day!

08:37.416 --> 08:40.486
So, you were using your
mobile while driving,

08:42.000 --> 08:42.555
so that's a three
month suspension.

08:42.622 --> 08:44.123
-Is it?
-Hmm.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.892
-And this was an emergency
call? -Yes, yes it was.

08:45.958 --> 08:46.792
Oh, well.

08:48.000 --> 08:48.227
Well, I mean, it was a work,

08:48.294 --> 08:51.764
a client sent me,
I'm a lawyer, so.

08:51.831 --> 08:53.566
Ah, sorry, lawyers don't
have special powers.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.401
No, of course, that wasn't
what I was trying to do.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.236
-There's no dispensations.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:57.303 --> 08:58.404
According to the law-

09:00.000 --> 09:00.539
Sorry, can you take your
sunglasses off so I can see
you.

09:00.606 --> 09:01.774
Hey, sure, sure, sure,
sorry I just-

09:01.841 --> 09:02.775
Oh, no, wow.

09:03.009 --> 09:05.912
Sorry, they're prescription,
I left my glasses at home.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.746
[both laughing]

09:06.812 --> 09:08.347
I'm always doing that.

09:08.414 --> 09:10.082
So blurry, yeah.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.920
Also, you, you pulled out
really erratically before.

09:13.986 --> 09:14.754
Did I?

09:14.820 --> 09:16.822
Yeah, you, you ran a stop sign.

09:16.889 --> 09:17.924
Did it say stop?

09:18.000 --> 09:18.758
Mum!

09:18.824 --> 09:19.859
Yeah, it was like, she was,

09:19.926 --> 09:22.161
the lollipop lady was holding
a big red stop sign.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.095
Oh.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.231
Yeah, if it was up to me.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.299
Aw, thank you so much.

09:26.365 --> 09:29.435
So it's not up to me,
what am I talking about?

09:30.000 --> 09:30.736
My dash camera
records everything,

09:30.803 --> 09:34.206
and my Sergeant always
checks it, so yeah.

09:36.000 --> 09:36.375
Sorry, what are you saying?

09:44.283 --> 09:45.551
There you go.

09:48.854 --> 09:49.922
This is ridiculous.

09:50.990 --> 09:52.058
Thank you very much.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.227
[truck honks]

09:56.696 --> 09:58.664
Mum, my costume!

10:03.369 --> 10:05.705
Hoon. Hoon.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.073
[woman on phone] Anti what?

10:07.139 --> 10:08.307
Anti-Hoon thing.

10:08.374 --> 10:09.742
Apparently they
can take your car

10:09.809 --> 10:11.510
if you've been driving
erratically or-

10:12.000 --> 10:13.346
Trying to look at
a picture of a penis.

10:13.412 --> 10:17.783
So now you've got no
licence and no car, Jesus.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.187
Oh, and Abby's costume
is in the boot of the car,

10:21.253 --> 10:22.355
which is impounded.

10:22.421 --> 10:23.055
You nitwit.

10:24.000 --> 10:24.256
Please don't tell Mum and Dad.

10:24.323 --> 10:25.858
Obviously,
I'm the good daughter,

10:25.925 --> 10:28.594
I don't even want to be
associated with your cockups.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.229
You look, where are you off to?

10:31.297 --> 10:32.965
-Trivia.
-With who, a date?

10:33.032 --> 10:33.966
No, not a date.

10:36.000 --> 10:36.268
Why would I go on a date
to trivia with Alex?

10:36.335 --> 10:40.306
Man are for sex and friends are
for dinner, movies, theatre.

10:42.000 --> 10:42.074
Oh, yeah, when's the last
time you went to the theatre?

10:42.141 --> 10:46.679
This is my life and
this is my sex life.

10:46.746 --> 10:47.646
Separate.

10:48.000 --> 10:48.781
All this shagging around.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.349
I can't believe you haven't
got chronic thrush

10:50.416 --> 10:51.917
or arthritic hips or something.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.519
I do have very stiff knees.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.054
I still don't know
how you're managing

10:55.121 --> 10:57.223
to pull all these
incredibly hot young men.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.392
Oh, thank you, thank you,
Helena.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.259
I'm serious.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.460
Do you think it's got anything
to do

11:01.527 --> 11:04.630
with the massive 'no
commitment' sign on my dating
profile?

11:06.000 --> 11:06.932
Yes, well, there's
nothing more attractive

11:06.999 --> 11:08.501
than someone who
doesn't want you.

11:08.567 --> 11:09.668
Exactly.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.573
-I miss you.
-I miss you.

11:14.640 --> 11:15.908
I only like you.

11:15.975 --> 11:17.443
I only like you, too.

11:18.000 --> 11:18.544
Sometimes my kids.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.280
Sometimes, not that often.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.148
[Lola exclaiming]

11:22.214 --> 11:23.649
[Helena] Oh, hi Lola!

11:24.000 --> 11:26.218
I need a snack,
I really need a snack.

11:26.285 --> 11:27.853
Ellia needs a snack too.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.455
Look, I got to run,
okay, night Lola.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.323
-Say "bye".
-Bye!

11:31.390 --> 11:33.793
Okay, so who is Ellia?

11:33.859 --> 11:35.461
And Ellia's sisters.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.730
And how many sisters
does Ellia have?

11:37.797 --> 11:39.432
One hundred million and seven.

11:39.498 --> 11:40.566
Okay, that's quite a lot.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.169
Marcus, Chloe, Amanda, Rocket,

11:43.235 --> 11:44.770
Happy House,
who plays all night.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.372
Okay, I'll give you
two crackers,

11:48.000 --> 11:49.508
you can share them
between all of them, okay?

11:49.575 --> 11:51.877
All right, the babysitter
will be here in a minute.

11:54.000 --> 11:54.513
What's that?

11:55.915 --> 11:56.882
[Lauren] Can't believe we lost.

11:56.949 --> 11:59.485
So next time, try not
just to be the loud lady

12:00.000 --> 12:01.287
in the corner,
shouting out the answers.

12:01.353 --> 12:03.389
Yes, sorry, I just
get a bit overexcited

12:03.456 --> 12:04.723
when I think I know the
answers.

12:04.790 --> 12:05.758
I really wanted to
win that meat tray.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.259
But you're a vegan.

12:07.326 --> 12:08.194
I'm not a vegan.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.195
Reese is a vegan.

12:09.261 --> 12:10.729
He's not a vegan either.

12:10.796 --> 12:11.997
Oh.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.200
Got a lot of ironing to do, so.

12:14.266 --> 12:15.734
No, no, what are you doing?

12:15.801 --> 12:16.635
Why are you-

12:18.000 --> 12:18.404
I just want to see
if anybody's around.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.239
But they're not vetted,
they're not in the spreadsheet.

12:20.306 --> 12:21.674
Oh, bingo!

12:21.740 --> 12:22.875
He's around the corner.

12:24.000 --> 12:24.009
Remember the weird guy
that turned up

12:24.076 --> 12:25.244
to Abby's birthday party?

12:25.311 --> 12:27.113
This is why we have
the spreadsheet.

12:27.179 --> 12:28.814
Background checks,
verify their pictures.

12:30.000 --> 12:30.483
Why is that picture
in black and white?

12:30.549 --> 12:31.917
Oh he's so mysterious.

12:31.984 --> 12:33.886
Black and white picture can
make a loaf of gluten-free
bread

12:33.953 --> 12:34.653
look mysterious.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.057
Maybe he's an actor, oh,
he looks like Marlon Brando.

12:38.124 --> 12:39.758
Or a pre-conviction Ted Bundy.

12:39.825 --> 12:40.860
Oh my God, he's coming.

12:42.000 --> 12:42.962
Okay, just, just wait
with me, wait with me.

12:43.028 --> 12:45.631
No, no, no, no, okay.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.900
[upbeat music]

13:00.000 --> 13:01.480
It's Marlon Brando, just a
bit of a later Marlon Brando.

13:01.547 --> 13:02.948
Don't leave me.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.684
Lauren?

13:06.000 --> 13:06.952
Well look at you.

13:07.019 --> 13:07.820
Oh.

13:12.000 --> 13:12.525
Hi.

13:12.591 --> 13:13.959
I'm Alex, I'm just leaving.

13:14.026 --> 13:16.061
He's just finishing
his drink, sorry.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.429
Well, look at you,
you're tasty.

13:18.000 --> 13:18.397
Oh, thank you.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.432
Look at me, I'm tasty.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.535
We're Like an
olive and a cherry

13:24.000 --> 13:25.437
in a sea of raisins
and cornichons.

13:25.504 --> 13:27.606
Cornichon?

13:28.207 --> 13:29.575
I'm a cherry?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.378
Cherry as middle-aged prime,
plump, juicy.

13:32.444 --> 13:33.646
Yeah, I get it.

13:33.712 --> 13:35.114
So, your place or mine?

13:36.000 --> 13:40.286
Oh, no way, but I've got
to go to the toilet.

13:40.352 --> 13:41.420
I'll be here.

13:42.000 --> 13:42.254
Thank you.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.856
Thinking of you,
on the toilet.

13:44.990 --> 13:45.824
Oh, god.

13:50.896 --> 13:53.966
-Are you in a band or?
-No.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.175
-Did do ceramics for a while.
-Hm, okay.

14:03.242 --> 14:05.077
[appetisers crunching]

14:08.180 --> 14:09.415
[phone ringing]

14:10.449 --> 14:11.183
Alex.

14:11.250 --> 14:11.717
Come back here right now.

14:12.151 --> 14:12.952
Don't you dare leave
me with this man.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.688
I'm sorry, but
he was quite strange.

14:16.889 --> 14:17.790
What am I meant to do?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.392
Yeah, um, maybe say
that I'm very sick.

14:20.459 --> 14:21.827
I'm going to tell him
you have diarrhoea.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.696
Diarrhoea, great,
and can you get my bag?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.464
It's quite an expensive one.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.133
Thank you, I'm in a back alley.

14:36.909 --> 14:39.011
-Sorry. -She is not coming
back, is she?

14:39.078 --> 14:40.980
No, no, she's not, no, sorry.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.450
As a lawyer and a person,

14:44.516 --> 14:46.151
can I advise you to
use current photos?

14:46.218 --> 14:47.553
It's sort of etiquette.

14:48.000 --> 14:48.587
Okay, yeah.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.924
And the, and the olive
and the cherry stuff.

14:54.000 --> 14:54.093
It's really creepy, okay, bye.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.362
Yep, all good feedback.

14:56.428 --> 14:58.464
[upbeat groovy music]

14:58.530 --> 14:59.932
[Lauren] Abby,
your viola's here!

15:00.000 --> 15:01.033
[Abby] Yes!

15:01.100 --> 15:04.737
Lola, if you're not dressed,
I will lose my mind.

15:06.000 --> 15:06.472
Oh, good, okay.

15:06.538 --> 15:08.774
I got to get you to work,
me to school.

15:08.841 --> 15:11.810
Oh, what has happened to that?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.412
[Lola] It's okay Mum.

15:13.479 --> 15:16.081
God's watching us,
he's in there.

15:18.000 --> 15:18.751
That light in the ball, is God.

15:19.718 --> 15:21.120
Have you been talking
to her about God again?

15:21.186 --> 15:23.055
I said he was everywhere,
not in the ball.

15:24.000 --> 15:24.456
He's in the ball.

15:24.523 --> 15:25.791
Okay. Go.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.427
Come on, go, go, go, go!

15:30.000 --> 15:30.896
-Great.
-Show and tell.

15:30.963 --> 15:32.564
Good.

15:32.631 --> 15:35.601
-Mum, door.
-Hey, girls.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.935
Door, door, door.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.271
-Careful, careful.
-Sorry Alex.

15:39.338 --> 15:41.607
3 months, only 3 months,
only 3 months, only 3 months,

15:42.000 --> 15:42.841
only 3 months.

15:42.908 --> 15:44.376
Okay, pop on in, and remember,

15:44.443 --> 15:47.079
we don't eat or drink
inside the Jensen.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.114
-[Lola] Yes sir.
-Thank you.

15:49.181 --> 15:50.683
Be careful of the wooden trim,

15:50.749 --> 15:52.284
it's very susceptible
to scuffing.

15:52.351 --> 15:53.319
[Lola] I can't get
my seatbelt on.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.487
[Lauren] Okay.
Who wants yogurt?

15:55.554 --> 15:57.256
-[Alex] No, no, no, no, no.
-[Lola] Me, me, me, me!

15:57.323 --> 15:58.557
[train bell]

16:00.000 --> 16:01.593
[Alex] Twelve weeks,
ninety days.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.495
[Lauren] Hopefully,
could be more.

16:03.562 --> 16:04.697
You're paying for
a weekly clean.

16:04.763 --> 16:05.898
I'll get my car back tomorrow,

16:06.000 --> 16:07.800
and then you can drive
us around in that.

16:07.866 --> 16:11.036
[laughs] Oh, let's get
you a sippy cup.

16:12.000 --> 16:12.538
Did you file the affidavit?

16:12.604 --> 16:14.673
Yes, of course. Did you
file the rugby player?

16:18.000 --> 16:18.077
Yes I did, and the beef,
a big banana.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.379
I've got another one I've
got to put in actually.

16:20.446 --> 16:23.349
Charlie BDSM.

16:24.000 --> 16:24.516
Okay, I'll do it
when I get inside.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.552
No, I know how to do it, Alex.

16:26.618 --> 16:29.021
Well, make sure you
sync it to the iCloud.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.123
You've told me a million times,
I know how to do it.

16:31.190 --> 16:34.026
Hang on, which way up is it.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.761
Hello?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.396
[Woman] Uh, Ms. Davies?

16:37.463 --> 16:39.765
Oh. Hello!

16:42.000 --> 16:42.835
It's Alice from
the school office.

16:42.901 --> 16:43.869
Oh yes, hi.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.871
Don't worry, everything's okay.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.274
I'm just calling because
Lola's here, she's very upset.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.310
Oh, no! What's happened?

16:51.377 --> 16:53.579
Well, she said she's left a
treasure box for show and tell-

16:54.000 --> 16:57.416
Oh, oh yes. Oh yes, we've
got it. We've got it.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.418
[Alice] I was just wondering
if you could maybe bring it in?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.019
Of course. We'll come now.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.588
Um, yeah, if we're quick.

17:02.654 --> 17:04.523
No problem. Thank you.

17:06.000 --> 17:06.191
Bye.

17:06.258 --> 17:08.293
Oh, no, no, no.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.462
Hey, next time you're
buying me a whole new car.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.064
Hang on. There we go.

17:12.131 --> 17:13.365
Chop, chop, chop, chop.

17:18.000 --> 17:18.003
[upbeat music]

17:24.000 --> 17:24.209
Hi, baby.

17:25.077 --> 17:27.045
-Hi Alex.
-Hey oh.

17:30.000 --> 17:30.416
[Abby] What are
you doing here?

17:31.450 --> 17:33.652
The show doesn't start
until half three.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.787
No, I know.
I'm just dropping this off

17:36.000 --> 17:36.054
because Lola forgot it.

17:36.121 --> 17:38.190
Did you get my costume
from the car?

17:39.691 --> 17:41.193
No, we're going there after.

17:42.000 --> 17:42.861
-It's good to see you.
-It's good to see you.

17:42.928 --> 17:45.164
Have you already met Mr.B?

17:45.230 --> 17:46.899
-No.
-Parent's evening.

17:48.000 --> 17:48.600
But he only just started.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.337
Abby, let's, let's go.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.042
God, he looks familiar.
Do I know that man?

17:58.177 --> 17:59.645
That was Hayden.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.847
Big Banana is
Abby's PE teacher?

18:01.914 --> 18:04.049
Yes. How did we not know this?

18:06.000 --> 18:06.251
Wow, I'm sorry, this is my
first sex spreadsheet,

18:06.318 --> 18:08.153
I'm learning on the hop here.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.589
Okay, we might need to be
a little bit more specific

18:10.656 --> 18:11.390
in the workplace column.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.492
Jesus. Yes. Please.

18:13.559 --> 18:15.928
Sorry. It's for
Lola's show and tell.

18:18.000 --> 18:18.730
Ah, yes. A little late,
but thank you.

18:18.797 --> 18:22.401
[Teacher] Okay. On the mat.
Lola can go first.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.877
I have lots of treasure,
and this is my new favourite.

18:36.114 --> 18:38.083
Thank you, Lola. That's lovely.

18:38.150 --> 18:41.487
Alyssa, would you
like to go next?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.355
[upbeat music]

18:48.126 --> 18:50.496
-Very professional.
-Hm.

18:50.562 --> 18:53.165
Need that costume.
Do you think I could-

18:54.000 --> 18:55.834
Do I think you could
climb over that fence? No.

18:55.901 --> 18:59.571
Do I think you should climb
over that fence? Also no. No!

19:00.000 --> 19:02.207
-[metal fence clanking]
-Oh, god.

19:02.274 --> 19:03.976
Sorry. Anyone notice me do
that?

19:04.042 --> 19:04.877
You gave it a shot.

19:06.000 --> 19:06.178
I just need a longer run-up.

19:09.548 --> 19:10.382
Hey, hey.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.187
Almost there.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.360
Okay, I reckon we
should probably go.

19:21.426 --> 19:22.427
Yeah, okay.

19:24.000 --> 19:24.997
Abby's going to kill me.

19:25.063 --> 19:27.232
See if we can come back
after mediation.

19:30.000 --> 19:30.002
Yup. We'll be
very fast lawyers.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.604
Come on.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.273
Gave it a shot.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.676
[Lauren] It's pretty
self-explanatory.

19:37.743 --> 19:38.877
Blah, blah, blah.

19:38.944 --> 19:41.513
Costs generally, stamp duty,
which we've discussed, so...

19:42.000 --> 19:43.615
Please, let me finish first.

19:48.854 --> 19:52.658
Yeah, we've agreed and been
over all this pretty
thoroughly, so.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.594
The more you interrupt me,
it will take longer.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.566
[Lauren whispers]
What time is it?

20:00.632 --> 20:01.967
[phone beeps]

20:02.034 --> 20:04.303
I'm done. Actually, sorry, no.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.139
I'm going to have to
ask for an adjournment.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.942
It's mediation, not court.

20:10.008 --> 20:11.877
Yes. I know that. I know that.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.879
Maybe another one hour.

20:13.946 --> 20:17.583
Sorry, we'll do this later.
Apologies!

20:18.000 --> 20:18.951
Take care. Have a nice day.

20:19.017 --> 20:20.485
[Alex] Thank you so much.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.854
[upbeat music]

20:24.656 --> 20:27.225
-[Teacher] Ah, Mrs. Davies!
-Ms. Davies.

20:27.292 --> 20:28.060
Can I have a quick word?

20:28.126 --> 20:29.094
Uh, no. Sorry.
Can I just see that-

20:30.000 --> 20:32.564
-Stop! It'll only take a sec.
-Okay.

20:33.332 --> 20:35.867
Um. Are you sure it was a-

20:36.000 --> 20:37.669
Quite.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.204
She must have thought it was a-

20:39.271 --> 20:41.173
Balloon. Apparently.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.242
Was it...

20:45.777 --> 20:46.845
..used?

20:48.000 --> 20:48.480
This is incredibly
inappropriate.

20:48.547 --> 20:49.982
I know. I'm mortified.

20:50.048 --> 20:51.049
And unprecedented.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.153
Yes. I would hope so. But an
innocent mistake, obviously.

20:55.220 --> 20:57.990
I'm now required to write
a letter to all class parents

20:58.056 --> 20:59.324
explaining what has occurred.

21:00.000 --> 21:00.392
Is that really necessary?

21:00.459 --> 21:01.193
Yes.

21:01.259 --> 21:03.295
Not naming Lola though, surely.

21:03.362 --> 21:04.563
No, it will be anonymous.

21:06.000 --> 21:06.765
Right. Good. Because legally,
legally-

21:06.832 --> 21:08.900
There's also the matter
of the psychological

21:08.967 --> 21:10.669
impact for Lola herself.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.841
[laughs] Lola's fine. This was
just a bit of a mix up.

21:18.000 --> 21:18.810
We'll be keeping a
very close eye on Lola.

21:18.877 --> 21:21.913
I also need to consider
whether it is still

21:24.000 --> 21:24.650
appropriate for you
to drive the minibus

21:24.716 --> 21:26.718
for next week's excursion.

21:30.000 --> 21:30.222
Mini bus? Yes. The minibus,

21:30.288 --> 21:33.291
which I haven't forgotten
I signed up to drive.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.162
I'd need a licence for that,
wouldn't I? Which I have.

21:37.229 --> 21:40.132
Yes, but now
all things considered.

21:40.198 --> 21:41.933
-Well.
-Yes. Yeah.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.602
Maybe it's better if I don't.

21:43.669 --> 21:47.506
Is there something else I can
help with? Reading groups or...

21:48.000 --> 21:49.207
[exclaims]

21:50.375 --> 21:51.610
Lego club?

21:54.000 --> 21:55.347
I had a really good time
the other night,

21:55.414 --> 21:56.381
but there's something
I need to tell you.

21:56.448 --> 21:57.683
Well, you've got some nerve.

21:57.749 --> 21:59.384
I didn't know your kids
went to this school!

22:00.000 --> 22:01.486
Oh yeah, what are the chances
they go to the school

22:01.553 --> 22:03.088
closest to my house?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.456
Honestly, this is
all your fault.

22:04.523 --> 22:05.524
What?

22:06.000 --> 22:08.593
This bloody slime disaster.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.561
What are you talking about?

22:12.000 --> 22:12.030
What's actually wrong with
you? No, don't answer that.

22:12.097 --> 22:14.700
You're a man. Of course you
don't pick up after yourself.

22:14.766 --> 22:17.135
Oh, okay. You've lost me.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.007
You, you left a fluorescent
yellow condom on my floor,

22:22.074 --> 22:23.775
where my
five-year-old found it

22:24.000 --> 22:26.378
and brought it in for
fucking show and tell.

22:27.646 --> 22:29.715
Hi. Mum.

22:36.000 --> 22:36.254
Oh, lovely.

22:36.321 --> 22:39.558
[buckets of slime
fall and splash]

22:42.227 --> 22:44.096
-[Lola] Mama?
-Yeah?

22:44.162 --> 22:47.132
Why didn't Mrs. Allan
like my balloon?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.101
Oh, baby.

22:50.469 --> 22:53.438
It's just probably
been a long time since

22:54.000 --> 22:55.140
she's seen a balloon like that.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.608
But she took it away.

22:56.675 --> 22:58.777
Yeah. She was just shocked.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.414
They're very rare,
those yellow ones.

23:02.948 --> 23:04.549
Can I get another?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.719
I will get you an even better,

23:07.786 --> 23:11.089
even more special balloon.
Okay?

23:12.224 --> 23:13.458
Now go back to sleep.

23:24.000 --> 23:24.336
Hey, will you come
with me for a second?

23:24.402 --> 23:26.171
I've got something
I want to show you.

23:30.000 --> 23:30.008
Abby?

23:37.182 --> 23:39.084
Please don't ignore me.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.624
Oh, just please, please.
It'll only take a second.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.728
-Come on.
-Fine.

23:50.862 --> 23:53.999
What I thought, because
I missed your show.

23:54.065 --> 23:56.735
I knew you would, and I had
to do it without my costume.

23:56.802 --> 23:59.271
I know. I'm sorry, baby.
I really tried.

24:00.000 --> 24:00.105
Sure.

24:00.338 --> 24:03.308
No, I did. I even asked
for an adjournment.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.142
Did you?

24:04.209 --> 24:05.210
Yeah.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.646
So I thought maybe you
could do your show again?

24:08.713 --> 24:10.348
Just for me?

24:18.000 --> 24:20.025

Yeah, hi.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.430
Girls look,
check out the crane.

24:58.763 --> 24:59.965
Whoa!

25:00.031 --> 25:03.268
-This you lot?
-Uh, yes. Is this correct?

25:03.335 --> 25:05.871
-You betcha.
-No.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.405
Can we get our car back?

25:07.472 --> 25:10.976
My encyclopaedia of the
Mormon Empire is in there.

25:12.000 --> 25:12.043
[Abby] Roman!

25:12.110 --> 25:12.878
Mormon!

25:12.944 --> 25:13.845
[Alex] Ah Lauren.

25:13.912 --> 25:15.513
[Abby] It's not.
They don't have an empire.

25:18.000 --> 25:18.550
Dad, do the Mormon's
have an empire?

25:18.617 --> 25:21.219
Yeah, I don't think you're
allowed to say "moron" anymore.

25:21.286 --> 25:23.088
Oh my gosh! It's Roman!

25:24.000 --> 25:25.123
Lauren, have you had
two other hoon offences?

25:25.190 --> 25:26.925
No. Never heard
of hoon offences.

25:26.992 --> 25:29.895
Uh, Loz. Right, see,
the thing is,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.529
do you remember when my
van was at the garage?

25:31.596 --> 25:33.999
I was using your car,
got heaps of grunt by the way,

25:34.065 --> 25:34.833
and I didn't
want to tell you

25:36.000 --> 25:36.001
because I knew
you'd be pissed.

25:36.067 --> 25:36.835
Yeah, well I am pissed.

25:36.902 --> 25:37.802
Bravo, Jake.

25:38.036 --> 25:39.738
So now there's been three
hoon offences in that car,

25:39.804 --> 25:41.206
which means-

25:42.000 --> 25:43.642
Which means...
[makes crushing sound]
