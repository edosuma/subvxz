The guest in Room 19
hasn't come back yet.

02:01:53.413 --> 02:01:55.047

02:01:55.048 --> 02:01:56.315
I'll call.

02:01:59.386 --> 02:02:01.820
Yes, he came here.

02:02:01.821 --> 02:02:03.822
He went into the backroom.

02:02:03.823 --> 02:02:05.524
Uh, no one was there,

02:02:05.525 --> 02:02:07.292
so he stayed only
a few minutes

02:02:07.293 --> 02:02:09.661
and left without
saying good night.

02:02:09.662 --> 02:02:12.297
He was, uh, holding
his hand to his mouth.
