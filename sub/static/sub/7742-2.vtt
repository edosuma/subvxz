00:01.752 --> 00:03.461
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:05.381 --> 00:06.422
Are you okay?

00:06.507 --> 00:08.800
I am executive of my mother's estate

00:08.884 --> 00:13.971
and, as such, it would mean the world
if I could set up a college fund for the girls,

00:14.056 --> 00:15.473
if for no other reason than taxes.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.643
Ladies, this is Sam. He's our new RN.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.854
You know I dismissed him because
he was wacked out on benzos.

00:21.939 --> 00:24.482
He successfully completed
a rehabilitation program.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.984
I have a stack of glowing
recommendations on my desk.

00:27.069 --> 00:29.070
Can we get something straight right now?

00:29.154 --> 00:30.405
You and I are not buddies. You got it?

00:30.489 --> 00:31.614
If you say so.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.408
-You missed one.
-It doesn't matter.

00:33.492 --> 00:37.078
The sun's going to explode
and eat up all the other planets anyways.

00:37.413 --> 00:39.080
Wow. That's nice.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.832
It's the ring I could never afford to give her.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.125
I still can't.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.418
How am I supposed to know?

00:43.502 --> 00:47.171
He wears a big fucking bracelet
that says, "I am diabetic."

00:47.506 --> 00:49.674
I need to lodge a formal complaint
against a nurse.

00:49.758 --> 00:50.800
Super.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.470
-What do we got?
-Jackie, really. Go.

03:09.147 --> 03:13.442
Goodness, that took a long time.
I was using an iron that was not plugged in.

03:13.569 --> 03:17.947
Fiona says Grace has been getting up
at night and unplugging appliances.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.574
Is that true?

03:19.658 --> 03:23.828
Faulty wiring causes more house fires
than cigarettes and arson combined.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.746
Where did you hear that?

03:29.418 --> 03:31.836
This is the best smoke detector they make.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.547
It's also a carbon monoxide detector.

03:38.510 --> 03:43.472
-I've been saving my allowance to buy it.
-Sweetie, thank you,

03:43.557 --> 03:47.310
but your allowance is for fun things
like toys and stickers.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.145
Here, sit down, sweetie. Eat your breakfast.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.982
Hey, Gracie, let Mom and Dad worry
about smoke detectors, okay?

03:53.066 --> 03:57.278
-Put your money away.
-I just don't want the house to burn down.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.131
Thank you.

04:24.723 --> 04:28.267
You know the number one ingredient
in hotdogs is cancer?

04:34.149 --> 04:36.943
I partied like a 20-year-old last night.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.987
Managed to score some grade A ecstasy.

04:40.656 --> 04:43.699
Dvornoff in psych
told me it would only last six hours

04:43.784 --> 04:45.701
and it's been nine!

04:46.828 --> 04:48.621
Still going strong.

04:50.082 --> 04:55.169
You know, I think my mother's death
ripped something open in me.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.300
You have wonderful daughters, Jacks.
Cherish them.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.344
I will. My goodness.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.347
Do they know I'm their godmum yet?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.767
Well, as it turns out,
I have not had that conversation

05:09.851 --> 05:12.228
-with Kevin yet...
-Just call them. Call them.

05:12.771 --> 05:17.066
And then let's all go
to the St. Regis for lunch, just us girls.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.944
-The girls are in school.
-We'll yank them out.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.697
Love is more important than reading!

05:22.781 --> 05:25.616
Maybe I'll just catch a taxi and then go,
no one will notice...

05:25.701 --> 05:28.577
Right now? No. You're staying right here.
Do not go anywhere.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.371
-Stay right here. With me.
-Taxi!

05:30.455 --> 05:32.373
You're here. Stay here.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.137
Hey, guys.

05:52.936 --> 05:56.063
-Was that a walk of shame?
-I don't want to know.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.400
Do we think
that Zoey got her pipes cleaned?

06:00.652 --> 06:03.738
It's like seeing Santa naked. It's not right.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.616
That's paper.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.498
Hi. You the parents?

06:14.583 --> 06:16.417
-What can I do for you?
-It's our son, Harry.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.544
He has a history of breathing problems.

06:18.628 --> 06:21.672
Our pediatrician said
it could be cystic fibrosis.

06:21.757 --> 06:25.676
We scheduled a sweat test to be sure,
but it isn't for another month.

06:25.761 --> 06:29.138
-He woke up choking. Could you help him?
-Sure.

06:29.222 --> 06:33.726
Harry, my name is Jackie.
Can I listen to your chest? Okay.

06:37.147 --> 06:40.566
Okay. It's restricted,
but he's definitely getting some air.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.069
Harry, do you like coloring books?

06:43.153 --> 06:44.695
Okay. Why don't I get you
some coloring books

06:44.780 --> 06:46.405
and I'll have a doctor come
and take a look, okay?

06:46.490 --> 06:49.283
-I don't like doctors.
-Yeah, me neither.

06:49.951 --> 06:53.204
Lennox Hill has newer equipment,
but we can certainly bundle him up

06:53.288 --> 06:55.539
and give him a sweat test here, if you like.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.542
That would be great.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.461
Okay. Why don't you sit tight?
I'll take care of that.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.671
And Dr. Cooper will be right in.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.392
Oh, my God! Dr. O'Hara, I'm so sorry!

07:15.477 --> 07:18.896
Zoey, ma petite fleur!

07:18.980 --> 07:21.190
-Zoey, get back to work.
-But she's...

07:21.274 --> 07:23.818
Here. Come here. You, come with me.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.241
Dear Dr. O'Hara,

07:30.325 --> 07:34.870
I would like to take this opportunity
to thank you for the lovely scarf.

07:35.497 --> 07:39.458
Stationery and stamps. Stamps!

07:39.751 --> 07:44.004
-There are little hearts there, and there.
-Hey, Jackie, Dr. O'Hara.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.549
-Hello.
-Can I help?

07:47.008 --> 07:49.218
-Actually...
-No, we are good.

07:51.096 --> 07:54.265
Your accent,
London with a touch of Sussex, right?

07:54.349 --> 07:55.349
Indeed.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.018
Spent my junior year in England.
I'm kind of an Anglophile.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.437
How convenient. I'm an Anglo.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.690
-So, what's going on?
-Nothing.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.860
-We're good. You can leave, please.
-Went clubbing.

08:05.944 --> 08:09.822
Tad dehydrated.
Feel like humping the world.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.782
Did you do a little X?

08:13.034 --> 08:16.495
Chasing your GNTs with a little Thai stick.
Impressive.

08:16.746 --> 08:20.124
-Does she have a little problem?
-No, her mother just died.

08:20.208 --> 08:23.961
She went out clubbing last night...
You know what? Get the hell out of here.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.171
Go!

08:27.591 --> 08:28.674
Bye.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.553
Jacks.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.723
Bored. Need magazines.

08:37.893 --> 08:41.145
-Thor, give me your magazines.
-What magazines?

08:41.813 --> 08:44.398
Give them to me, including In Touch.

08:51.406 --> 08:55.284
-How can you read this crap?
-Please don't amplify my shame.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.751
I know you like In Touch.

09:08.632 --> 09:11.258
Look. Goldie and Kate.

09:11.635 --> 09:14.887
Mother and daughter, together,

09:14.971 --> 09:17.389
just loving each other.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.351
I should've called my mother more often.

09:20.644 --> 09:24.647
Did you know that when I was at university,
we used to speak to each other every day?

09:24.731 --> 09:26.273
No, I didn't.

09:26.358 --> 09:29.193
I'd forgotten how affectionate she was
on the phone.

09:29.277 --> 09:33.197
Speaking of, I can't figure out
how to delete her from my contacts.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.908
Clearly, you need to give yourself
some time to grieve.

09:35.992 --> 09:39.036
In the meantime, CT scan, CT scan.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.704
This one needs a full workup,

09:40.789 --> 09:43.374
this one needs a shitload of Haldol
and a psych eval.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.502
Sign off on these.
Then you can read your crap.

09:58.139 --> 10:02.101
-Hey! Need a hand?
-Hey, man. How you doing?

10:02.185 --> 10:03.644
-Great. How are you?
-Good.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.563
No, I think I can handle this one. Thanks.

10:07.524 --> 10:10.693
-Strong man.
-There you go.

10:10.777 --> 10:14.321
So how's everything? How's the family?
How's your wife? Jackie, right?

10:14.406 --> 10:17.074
Yeah. Good memory.
Yeah, she's good, man. We're good.

10:17.158 --> 10:20.327
-Things are great. Better than ever.
-That's nice.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.038
Did she like that ring you got her?

10:23.748 --> 10:26.750
Did I show you that? You do pay attention.

10:26.835 --> 10:30.879
-Yeah, man, she loved it. She loved it.
-All right. That's great. That's great.

10:31.214 --> 10:34.174
So how about you, huh?
Haven't seen you for a while.

10:34.259 --> 10:38.095
Yeah. I tried to kill myself.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.890
I OD'd on some drugs
trying to get a girl's attention.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.351
You believe that? Didn't work.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.187
-Man.
-Yeah.

10:48.523 --> 10:52.276
I'm just fucking with you.
I didn't try to kill myself.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.527
Jesus.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.572
-You are a sick fuck.
-I know, I know.

10:56.656 --> 11:00.117
I got a sick sense of humor. I'm sorry.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.578
-How about a beer?
-Yeah. You got a Bud?

11:02.662 --> 11:03.746
Yeah.

11:09.044 --> 11:12.629
To love. To women. To Jackie.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.340
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

11:16.092 --> 11:19.303
-How you feeling, little buddy?
-Hot.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.805
I guess that was a silly question.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.933
Anyway, it seems strange, I know,
but it is the standard test

11:25.018 --> 11:28.479
to confirm or eliminate
the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

11:28.563 --> 11:29.646
We force Harry to sweat

11:29.731 --> 11:32.441
and then we measure
the amount of chloride in his perspiration.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.361
We know.
Jackie explained everything to us.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.571
Good.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.531
How much longer
does he have to wear all this?

11:39.616 --> 11:40.824
Not much longer.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.827
Then I'll do everything I can
to get you the test results quickly.

11:43.912 --> 11:47.081
And I'll do everything I can
to make sure he does.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.960
-But I'm on it, so...
-And I'm on him, so...

11:52.587 --> 11:56.006
-I got it.
-I'll just check and I will double check.

11:57.634 --> 12:01.178
A little bit OCD,
but not a bad thing if you're a nurse.

12:03.181 --> 12:05.182
Your son's in good hands.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.311
-What are you doing?
-Tweeting.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.523
People follow my life online.
I'm sharing my thoughts with the world.

12:12.607 --> 12:16.276
-Are you blogging about that little boy?
-It's not a blog, it's Twitter.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.529
You can't do that. It's private.

12:18.613 --> 12:21.407
Everyone remains anonymous,
except for me.

12:22.325 --> 12:26.120
If I said "cys fib,"
would you know that's cystic fibrosis?

12:26.204 --> 12:29.623
If I said "F you,"
would you know that's "eat shit"?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.712
Bee-yotch.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.844
-That's a nice scarf.
-Thanks.

12:42.720 --> 12:46.140
It's from Hermès,
which I think is a pretty good store.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.893
-Dr. O'Hara gave it to me.
-Cool.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.981
Does Dr. O'Hara have a problem?

12:54.065 --> 12:56.150
-I mean, with the drugs.
-No.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.070
-Does Jackie?
-No.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.322
-You sure?
-Positive.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.576
And since you're asking,
I don't do drugs, either.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.911
Although, when I go to Great Adventure,
I do take Dramamine

13:07.996 --> 13:10.706
'cause once, on Rolling Thunder, I yacked.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.791
And it was a huge bummer.

13:12.959 --> 13:17.171
I see your sins, for I am God!

13:17.839 --> 13:21.258
-That's God.
-It's 12:53 pm.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.385
Vermin!

13:24.012 --> 13:27.556
I used to be totally scared of him,
but now, not so much.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.517
And he's crazy.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.562
Hey, you! Yeah, you, sir,

13:33.980 --> 13:35.939
with the misshapen head,

13:36.024 --> 13:38.650
how do you wake up in the morning?

13:38.735 --> 13:40.944
-I love this guy.
-And you!

13:41.029 --> 13:43.989
Hey! You, pizza face!

13:44.532 --> 13:47.534
You shall never marry!

13:47.702 --> 13:51.205
You won't even be engaged! I am God!

13:51.331 --> 13:54.958
Bow, bow, bow to me, you sinners and...

13:57.795 --> 13:59.421
God's down!

13:59.506 --> 14:03.008
A lake of fire will swallow you up!

14:03.885 --> 14:05.344
Pimps and whores!

14:05.428 --> 14:08.472
-On my count, one, two, three.
-Get the fuck off me!

14:08.556 --> 14:10.641
I'll smite every one of you fucking assholes!

14:10.725 --> 14:12.976
He's in psychosis. Can I have some
vitamin H over here, please?

14:13.061 --> 14:16.021
-Haldol, shaken not stirred.
-Getting the IV.

14:24.155 --> 14:26.073
This is God, age unknown.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.242
He's probably about 50.
He lives across the street.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.744
-Schizophrenic, currently off meds.
-I know this guy.

14:30.828 --> 14:33.664
-Got hit in the head with a bottle.
-He told me I was super handsome

14:33.748 --> 14:36.458
-like Clark Gable.
-I retract!

14:37.585 --> 14:39.378
Let's stitch him up.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.054
You are an angel.

14:52.850 --> 14:56.103
Will you stop fucking twittering
and focus, please?

14:59.023 --> 15:01.191
"Bitchy nurse being bitchy again."

15:01.276 --> 15:04.403
Don't do that.
Don't you dare twitter about me.

15:09.993 --> 15:12.911
Thanks for telling me I'm an angel.

15:14.289 --> 15:17.124
When I was younger,
I actually thought I was an angel

15:17.208 --> 15:22.004
because I had a round face.
And I thought about becoming a nun.

15:23.631 --> 15:29.595
Sound of Music.
But I really like boys, so I didn't.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.764
Not all boys. There's one boy.

15:32.849 --> 15:36.143
More man. Or man-boy.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.478
But he's totally...

15:41.316 --> 15:46.153
It feels really inappropriate
talking about this with you, God, sir.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.573
You know, when I hit my head,
I seen something.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.700
Like what?
Like a bottle whizzing towards you?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.243
I seen this tunnel

15:53.328 --> 15:57.289
with this incredibly bright light
at the end of it,

15:57.373 --> 16:00.000
but it didn't hurt to look at.

16:00.084 --> 16:04.171
And at the end of the tunnel,
I met the most loving presence.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.216
And I just knew it was God. I saw God.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.719
But I thought you were God.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.055
I mean,
I thought you thought you were God.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.682
-I am God.
-So you saw yourself?

16:15.767 --> 16:20.854
-No.
-So you saw God and it wasn't you.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.107
-Yeah.
-So,

16:25.860 --> 16:30.322
I guess that means that you're not God.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.700
Oh, my God.

16:35.703 --> 16:38.705
Oh, my... I'm not God!

16:38.790 --> 16:41.041
-I'm not God!
-Wait. Calm down.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.043
I'm not God!

16:46.673 --> 16:48.590
I'm not God!

16:51.302 --> 16:53.679
Zoey, handle it.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.555
I'm not God!

17:03.439 --> 17:07.943
-Jackie, I found these.
-Okay. Where?

17:08.486 --> 17:11.738
-Right over here on the floor.
-Good catch. I'll take them.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.991
-Are they yours?
-Are they mine? No.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.578
What is hospital policy
regarding lost or found drugs?

17:18.663 --> 17:20.539
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.958
-Why so desperate?
-Excuse me?

17:23.042 --> 17:26.670
You just seem
really anxious for me to hand them over.

17:26.754 --> 17:30.757
Do you want to get your ass kicked?
Give them to me. Now.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.762
Come with me.

17:36.681 --> 17:39.766
Any unidentifiable drugs or substances
go into the slot.

17:39.851 --> 17:42.352
That is hospital procedure. Got it?

17:56.909 --> 17:58.452
Pain in my ass.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.898
-Hey.
-Hey, babe.

18:27.982 --> 18:30.692
-Listen, Luis is a firefighter, right?
-Yeah.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.320
-Is he there?
-Yeah, he's here.

18:33.404 --> 18:35.906
Can you do me a favor?
Can you ask him to go over to the house

18:35.990 --> 18:39.159
and explain to Grace
that the house will not just burn down?

18:39.243 --> 18:41.745
-Maybe that'll ease her mind a little bit?
-That's a great idea.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.664
-All right. Love you.
-Love you, too. Bye.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.504
-The wife?
-Yeah.

18:54.008 --> 18:56.009
I fucking love beer nuts.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.184
Come in.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.605
Hi. A few things.

19:09.941 --> 19:13.276
First of all, Coop will not stop twittering.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.196
It is interfering with work
and it's pissing me off.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.656
That's interesting.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.700
Dr. Cooper lodged a formal complaint
against you.

19:20.785 --> 19:25.372
-Against me? Really? For what?
-Insubordination and general bitchiness.

19:26.374 --> 19:30.502
Fucking A.
Twitter tweetering fucking dickhead.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.463
-Anything else?
-Yes. This Sam guy,

19:33.548 --> 19:35.340
like every newly-sober person,

19:35.424 --> 19:37.926
he's convinced that everyone
around him is an addict.

19:38.010 --> 19:42.138
It's like the born-again guy we had last year.
I'm just saying.

19:42.223 --> 19:45.642
Also, one of my nurses
needs a pediatric psych referral.

19:45.726 --> 19:49.312
-Which one?
-She'd rather not say.

19:49.397 --> 19:53.108
Be helpful if I knew how old the child was
before making a referral.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.734
Yes, well, she's a very private person

19:54.819 --> 19:57.362
and she would rather not
have everyone know her personal life.

19:57.446 --> 20:01.283
I would say the kid's between,
I don't know, seven and 12.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.493
-Gender?
-Look, she wants a list of shrinks

20:03.578 --> 20:05.954
that take our insurance
and she wants it anonymously.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.957
-You know what? Forget about it.
-Jackie.

20:11.669 --> 20:16.172
Here is the best child psychiatrist I know,

20:17.008 --> 20:19.301
and she takes our health plan.

20:20.595 --> 20:24.431
-Thank you.
-She was tremendously helpful with my boy.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.517
Thanks.

20:32.648 --> 20:36.902
Hi, I have the family of a little boy
waiting for the results of a CF sweat test.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.528
I would really love to send them home.

20:38.613 --> 20:40.989
I can only give the results to the doctor
who ordered the tests.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.451
I know. Dr. Cooper really wants the results,
but he's in with a trauma right now.

20:44.535 --> 20:47.078
And if the test is positive,
I need to set up an IV...

20:47.163 --> 20:50.790
Look, I'd really like to help you out here,
but I can't.

20:52.668 --> 20:53.793
Okay.

20:54.003 --> 20:58.965
Everything's really preliminary at this point,
so it's just better not to give out. Sorry.

21:00.009 --> 21:03.428
-How old?
-Three months.

21:03.846 --> 21:05.347
Smiling yet?

21:07.224 --> 21:09.893
It's really awful when they get sick.

21:11.312 --> 21:14.314
-What's the name?
-Miller, first name Harry.

21:18.486 --> 21:21.237
The whole run's not complete,
but the prelims look good.

21:21.322 --> 21:22.739
Thank you.

21:26.535 --> 21:29.871
Okay, so I went to the lab
and talked to the tech.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.624
You have to keep in mind that the doctor
has not seen the results yet,

21:32.708 --> 21:35.377
but so far they are looking very good.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.879
Thank God.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.422
So why don't you all go home
and get some rest?

21:39.507 --> 21:43.510
Thank you so much.
You've been so wonderful.

21:44.762 --> 21:47.389
-Really? We can take him home?
-Yeah. I would.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.766
Just... Thank you.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.186
See you, Harry.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.021
-Say bye.
-Bye.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.568
I'm telling you, man, it's great.

22:01.737 --> 22:06.282
You can see the lights of Citi Field.
It's way brighter than Shea used to be.

22:06.367 --> 22:08.243
You been yet, to Citi?

22:08.995 --> 22:11.162
-Not yet.
-You want to go sometime?

22:11.247 --> 22:13.373
My brother gets me tickets.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.209
-I would love that.
-Cool.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.380
-Islanders, too.
-No shit.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.385
Would I shit you?

22:37.356 --> 22:38.481
Thor?

22:52.830 --> 22:55.790
-It's not what you think.
-Donuts. Really?

22:56.333 --> 22:58.668
You already lost one eye, am I right?

22:58.753 --> 23:02.589
-How did you know?
-Today in trauma with God,

23:03.549 --> 23:07.177
I had my hand next to your face
for about 20 minutes before you saw it.

23:07.261 --> 23:10.972
Also, I kind of just used my Spidey sense.

23:14.435 --> 23:19.439
You are the only one who knows.
I haven't even told my new boyfriend yet.

23:20.274 --> 23:22.067
Thanks for covering.

23:24.612 --> 23:27.197
It's a shell. It's porcelain.

23:27.281 --> 23:30.283
They paint it to match my other eye.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.786
It's great. You would never know.

23:32.870 --> 23:35.705
-You want to see?
-Sure.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.841
Wow, will you look at you?

24:04.944 --> 24:07.612
What do you think of the new guy, Sam?

24:10.199 --> 24:14.202
I think he's really smart and incredibly cute.

24:14.912 --> 24:17.872
And I think
he's probably an excellent nurse.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.876
-I don't like him.
-He's dead to me.

24:28.425 --> 24:32.262
-Go on, yell at someone.
-I don't want to.

24:33.389 --> 24:36.474
Come on. You're so good at it.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.855
Look at the bald dude.

24:42.606 --> 24:47.026
Say, "Hey, baldy, you're all bald.
Grow some hair, you idiot."

24:47.820 --> 24:51.823
-What's the point? I'm not God.
-Sure you are.

24:54.285 --> 24:58.746
I'm not. I've seen God, and he wasn't me.

24:59.123 --> 25:02.167
-That doesn't mean anything.
-It means everything.

25:02.251 --> 25:06.004
It means I'm not God.
It means my life is a sham.

25:07.798 --> 25:11.092
-Well, Jesus wasn't God.
-So?

25:11.177 --> 25:16.848
But he's still, like, really important
in the religious hierarchal stratification.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.351
So maybe you're like Jesus.

25:23.480 --> 25:29.194
Okay, Jesus was the son of God.
So maybe you're, like, the nephew of God,

25:30.196 --> 25:32.405
or the brother-in-law of God.

25:34.742 --> 25:37.076
I like where this is going.

25:37.161 --> 25:41.331
Hey, you, strumpet with the thinning hair!

25:41.749 --> 25:47.253
I can see your soul! You whore!

25:50.382 --> 25:55.678
Lather, rinse, repeat!
That's how they'll get you!

25:58.432 --> 26:01.517
-Where's the sweat-test kid?
-I sent them home.

26:02.102 --> 26:05.355
Why don't you run to Akalitus
and lodge a formal complaint?

26:05.439 --> 26:08.024
-What do you mean, you sent them home?
-What don't you understand?

26:08.108 --> 26:11.277
They were sitting here for over six hours
while you were dicking around somewhere.

26:11.362 --> 26:13.446
So I went to the lab, I got the results,

26:13.530 --> 26:15.240
which were negative
in case you're interested,

26:15.324 --> 26:18.034
-and I sent them home.
-Negative.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.747
What the fuck is wrong with you?

26:22.831 --> 26:25.375
-Excuse me?
-Those test results were preliminary.

26:25.459 --> 26:28.711
I was waiting for the final results,
which, by the way, were positive.

26:28.796 --> 26:31.714
-The kid's got cystic fibrosis.
-Oh, fucking God, no.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.883
Yeah. Harry and his family
are home celebrating,

26:33.968 --> 26:35.551
and now it's my job to pick up the phone

26:35.636 --> 26:39.305
and tell them that their kid's
not going to live to see 30.

26:40.140 --> 26:42.892
What's the matter? No snappy comeback?

26:44.603 --> 26:48.189
-Let me call them?
-Have a nice goddamn night.
