00:04.250 --> 00:06.411
[Ben]
Previously on Siren.

00:06.420 --> 00:07.876
[screaming]

00:07.880 --> 00:09.529
That oil company,
they're mapping

00:09.540 --> 00:10.950
a thousand square
miles of ocean.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.530
That's gonna take months.

00:12.540 --> 00:14.076
[Helen] We need to feed them,
clothe them.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.320
I want my money.

00:15.330 --> 00:17.036
[Elaine]
It's pretty unlikely

00:17.040 --> 00:18.826
that you are related
to the Pownalls.

00:18.830 --> 00:21.537
It's them. He's with them.
The one who killed my dad.

00:21.540 --> 00:23.110
Hey! Come here,
you son of a bitch!

00:23.120 --> 00:24.326
You want them here, huh?!

00:24.330 --> 00:25.456
[groaning]

00:25.460 --> 00:26.449
[facilitator]
Hey, Ben.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.916
What brings you here today?

00:27.920 --> 00:29.660
[Ben]
A complicated relationship.

00:29.670 --> 00:31.240
What if the way
I feel about you

00:31.250 --> 00:32.911
has nothing to do
with the song?

00:32.920 --> 00:34.490
Be careful, Marissa.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.412
If anything unusual
comes up, you call me.

00:37.420 --> 00:39.240
-Like what?
-[clerk groans]

00:39.250 --> 00:40.877
You'll know when it happens.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.745
[Ryn] She was leader.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.911
Now she must ask Ryn
for help.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.069
[hisses]

00:46.080 --> 00:48.662
[Ryn]
I am stronger than you.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.031
[Ben]
100 million years ago,

00:55.040 --> 00:57.782
this whole place
was covered in water.

00:57.790 --> 01:00.281
115 million years ago.

01:00.290 --> 01:02.110
Uh, who's counting?

01:02.120 --> 01:03.280
[laughs]

01:03.290 --> 01:05.497
Who take the water?

01:05.500 --> 01:09.493
Oh, no. No one.
No one, uh...

01:09.500 --> 01:11.377
It's this thing
called plate tectonics.

01:11.380 --> 01:12.529
It's where the Earth is...

01:12.540 --> 01:13.996
What Ben's saying is

01:14.000 --> 01:16.241
your people could have
lived right here

01:16.250 --> 01:19.208
a long time ago.

01:19.210 --> 01:21.030
Hey.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.201
Hey, hey, hey.

01:23.210 --> 01:24.279
Careful.

01:24.290 --> 01:26.372
It's poison ivy.

01:26.380 --> 01:28.166
Poison.

01:28.170 --> 01:29.740
What is this?

01:30.790 --> 01:33.076
So some plants

01:33.080 --> 01:34.286
are bad for you.

01:34.290 --> 01:37.077
This one hurts you, okay?

01:37.080 --> 01:39.457
It's, uh...
It's dangerous.

01:39.460 --> 01:41.075
[soft hiss]

01:41.080 --> 01:42.536
Hurt.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.371
No touch.

01:44.380 --> 01:46.200
But some are good.

01:46.210 --> 01:49.418
In water we use
plants to get better.

01:49.420 --> 01:51.411
Yeah, like medicine.

01:51.420 --> 01:52.819
-Yes.
-[twig snaps]

01:58.420 --> 01:59.785
[hisses]

02:01.750 --> 02:03.320
I go.

02:13.670 --> 02:15.069
[hisses]

02:27.790 --> 02:29.872
[horn honks,
brakes screech]

02:32.670 --> 02:34.786
Why the hell are you
running out like that?!

02:34.790 --> 02:37.372
Are you crazy?
I could have killed all of you!

02:37.380 --> 02:38.199
No!

02:41.380 --> 02:42.824
[hisses]

02:46.250 --> 02:47.535
Shit.

02:47.540 --> 02:49.872
-Shit.
-[engine starts]

02:49.880 --> 02:50.995
[tires squeal]

02:58.080 --> 03:00.071
[placid high-pitched calls]

03:06.540 --> 03:09.282
In water, we hunt.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.496
Always.

03:10.500 --> 03:11.535
Yeah, well,

03:11.540 --> 03:13.326
it's too risky on land.

03:13.330 --> 03:14.319
They could hurt someone.

03:14.330 --> 03:15.957
-You could be seen.
-Ryn.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.166
Your skin.

03:18.250 --> 03:19.956
[hisses]

03:22.420 --> 03:24.285
Can't show.

03:24.290 --> 03:26.281
You don't want them to
see that you're weak?

03:26.290 --> 03:27.666
Yes.

03:27.670 --> 03:29.410
She will fight.

03:29.420 --> 03:31.877
Unﬁlend.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.279
To be leader.

03:34.620 --> 03:36.167
We won't let
anyone hurt you.

03:36.170 --> 03:39.378
Ben and Maddie
cannot fight for me.

03:44.380 --> 03:46.371
I must go in the water soon.

03:49.710 --> 03:51.746
What about High Point Cove?

03:51.750 --> 03:54.287
I pulled
the Coastal Commission report.

03:54.290 --> 03:56.326
Klesco is expanding
its mapping grid,

03:56.330 --> 03:58.116
moving closer to shore.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.610
It's all off limits now.

03:59.620 --> 04:01.167
I go eat.

04:05.170 --> 04:07.377
We have hydration lotion
for the seals at the Center.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.325
It could help
with her scaling.

04:09.330 --> 04:10.376
Yeah, that could work.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.916
I'll be back in an hour.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.205
Less.

04:25.170 --> 04:28.162
Taking a trip
down memory lane?

04:28.170 --> 04:29.376
You showed me that
on our third date.

04:29.380 --> 04:30.916
I remember it like it was...

04:30.920 --> 04:32.376
20 years ago.

04:32.380 --> 04:34.166
Hm.

04:34.170 --> 04:36.536
I think that might have been
the last time I saw it, too.

04:36.540 --> 04:39.111
Been carrying
a service weapon ever since.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.246
Haven't needed it.

04:43.170 --> 04:44.319
Why do you need it now?

04:44.330 --> 04:45.911
You're on leave.

04:45.920 --> 04:48.377
As long as you and Maddie
are in Bristol Cove,

04:49.540 --> 04:50.916
I'm on duty.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.569
Badge or no badge.

05:00.580 --> 05:03.492
[distant boat horn blowing ]

05:09.380 --> 05:11.371
[door opens]

05:13.210 --> 05:15.110
Hope I didn't wake you.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.827
Yeah.
No, that would be the, um,

05:17.830 --> 05:19.286
pounding headache.

05:19.290 --> 05:21.372
Are you looking for something?

05:21.380 --> 05:22.574
My keys.

05:22.580 --> 05:24.992
Um... purse?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.877
Of course.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.165
How could I forget?

05:28.170 --> 05:30.616
You know, um,
nine times out of ten,

05:30.620 --> 05:33.498
a woman's keys are usually
hiding in the purse.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.616
All right, Sherlock.

05:35.620 --> 05:38.418
Hmm, so now I'm late,
and I look like an idiot.

05:38.420 --> 05:40.376
Aw, I been there.
You'll bounce back.

05:58.460 --> 06:00.246
Tsst!

06:00.250 --> 06:02.536
[whispering] Don't move.

06:02.540 --> 06:03.746
What is it?

06:05.460 --> 06:06.666
Do you see that?

06:08.540 --> 06:09.609
[squeaking]

06:12.580 --> 06:15.538
So clowns, Lady Gaga,

06:15.540 --> 06:16.666
now rats?

06:16.670 --> 06:18.661
Any other phobias, Jerry?

06:18.670 --> 06:20.285
Wh-- Wh-- Are you crazy?!

06:20.290 --> 06:21.496
There could be a nest!

06:23.080 --> 06:25.662
Can't just leave them
in the warehouse.

06:25.670 --> 06:26.785
Unh!

06:26.790 --> 06:28.246
I'll figure out what to do.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.536
You call your therapist.

06:37.710 --> 06:39.075
[sighs]

07:07.500 --> 07:08.660
[knock on door]

07:09.710 --> 07:10.699
Maddie.

07:10.710 --> 07:11.699
No, no, no, wait.

07:11.710 --> 07:12.699
Wait.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.319
Officer Staub.

07:18.330 --> 07:19.570
Ben?

07:19.580 --> 07:21.536
Everything all right?

07:21.540 --> 07:23.371
We got a call
about some folks

07:23.380 --> 07:25.416
who trashed a mini-mart
down the road.

07:25.420 --> 07:28.321
Clerk said they took off
in a Pownall Seafood van.

07:28.330 --> 07:29.570
Know anyone else
who drives one?

07:33.750 --> 07:35.877
It's my fault.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.872
We had a few too many,
my buddies...

07:38.880 --> 07:42.532
Ben, clerk said
there was women, too.

07:42.540 --> 07:45.668
Well... yeah.

07:45.670 --> 07:48.571
_It was a...
a thing, you know?

07:48.580 --> 07:50.320
It was a party.

07:52.790 --> 07:54.530
Still going apparently?

07:56.540 --> 07:57.746
I've got this.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.618
They were too drunk
to drive home this morning.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.281
Party's over, Ben.

08:08.290 --> 08:10.246
Any more disturbances,
I will be back,

08:10.250 --> 08:12.070
and your friends
will need to come

08:12.080 --> 08:13.877
talk it over with me
at the station.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.416
Yes, ma'am.

08:15.420 --> 08:16.535
Thank you.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.569
We gotta get
the hell out of here.

08:29.580 --> 08:31.616
[engine starts]

08:55.380 --> 08:56.665
[coughing]

08:59.080 --> 09:00.820
Can I get a red eye
and bagel to go?

09:00.830 --> 09:01.660
Want it toasted?

09:01.670 --> 09:02.876
Burn it to a crisp.

09:04.540 --> 09:07.111
Xander. Rough night?

09:07.120 --> 09:08.530
Yeah, you should, um...

09:08.540 --> 09:10.667
You should see
the six other guys.

09:10.670 --> 09:13.207
He got in a fight
with one of his best friends.

09:13.210 --> 09:14.575
Men.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.247
You and Ben get into it
at his party the other night?

09:19.250 --> 09:20.319
What party?

09:20.330 --> 09:22.616
At his family's cabin.

09:22.620 --> 09:23.700
Then I'm guessing
you don't know anything

09:23.710 --> 09:25.075
about the gas station, either.

09:25.080 --> 09:28.117
No, no. I haven't been
out to the cabin in, uh,

09:30.250 --> 09:31.569
a long time.

09:31.580 --> 09:35.869
Well, I hope you and Ben
work things out.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.666
Not so sure
about his new friends.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.239
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.452
I had no idea
what it was at first.

09:50.460 --> 09:53.497
Yeah, I'm still not sure.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.616
There was a seal birth
years ago.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.326
This must be
the tank they used.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.661
What is this?

09:58.670 --> 10:02.208
A tank. We'll fill it
with seawater.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.871
We can't bring you
to the ocean,

10:03.880 --> 10:06.030
but we can bring
the ocean to you in here.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.075
We hope.

10:08.880 --> 10:10.495
It is safe here?

10:11.540 --> 10:12.575
It's all we got.

10:14.920 --> 10:15.955
[hisses]

10:17.790 --> 10:18.950
We stay.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.700
Inside.

10:20.710 --> 10:21.779
Safe here.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.530
Back to woods.

10:25.540 --> 10:27.246
Not inside.

10:27.250 --> 10:28.820
The woods are dangerous.

10:28.830 --> 10:29.819
Poison.

10:29.830 --> 10:30.819
[hisses]

10:30.830 --> 10:32.878
[hisses]

10:32.880 --> 10:36.202
Human is leader now.

10:36.210 --> 10:37.996
Not you.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.991
_[ -[hiss]
gasping hiss]

10:42.330 --> 10:45.322
Oh_. What the hell
IS gonng on?

10:45.330 --> 10:47.491
Survival of the fittest.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.162
Maybe cooping them up
in this shoebox

10:50.170 --> 10:52.377
isn't a great idea.

10:52.380 --> 10:53.824
We don't have a choice.

10:53.830 --> 10:55.912
Well, we can find
somewhere with more space

10:55.920 --> 10:58.286
once I can access
the trust.

10:58.290 --> 10:59.826
Why can't you
access it now?

10:59.830 --> 11:01.741
You'd have to ask
your mother.

11:01.750 --> 11:03.706
She's holding out on you?

11:03.710 --> 11:05.780
Think it's time
we poke the bear?

11:08.330 --> 11:10.116
Yeah, it's time.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.167
[Ben]
Mom, the money's hers.

11:13.170 --> 11:15.286
Well, this is between Helen,
myself, and your father,

11:15.290 --> 11:18.612
and I find it outrageous
that she talked to you.

11:18.620 --> 11:20.417
Well, she
doesn't have anything.

11:20.420 --> 11:22.615
She has no one,
so that's why she told me.

11:22.620 --> 11:24.531
Hmm.

11:24.540 --> 11:25.746
What is this?

11:25.750 --> 11:28.321
I did a DNA test online.

11:28.330 --> 11:29.991
It's amazing
how easy it is now.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.320
-On Helen?
-Mm-hmm.

11:33.330 --> 11:35.161
How did you even... ?

11:35.170 --> 11:36.956
I took her empty coffee cup.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.825
I'm sure
she didn't miss it.

11:40.790 --> 11:41.950
Phew. Wow.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.578
We needed to verify
if she was a Pownall.

11:45.580 --> 11:48.378
And think what you want,
but these results

11:48.380 --> 11:50.826
reaffirm all of my doubts
about that woman.

11:50.830 --> 11:51.990
She's not a Pownall?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.161
Unfortunately,
that part's true.

11:54.170 --> 11:56.616
Okay, so...
so what is this?

11:58.120 --> 11:59.326
[clears throat]

12:01.880 --> 12:04.201
Rick Marzdan.

12:05.210 --> 12:06.416
Who's he?

12:06.420 --> 12:08.035
A direct relative
of Helen's,

12:08.040 --> 12:10.031
according to that test,

12:10.040 --> 12:11.871
and he lives
ten minutes away

12:11.880 --> 12:14.030
in Bismark.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.782
Now, Helen has always
claimed that she is
the last in her lineage.

12:18.170 --> 12:19.990
Helen has family.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.036
Yeah. And my guess is
that they are scheming together

12:22.040 --> 12:24.247
on how to squeeze more money
from our family.

12:24.250 --> 12:27.572
There's no way
Helen knows about this.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.289
Well, I might not
be able to keep her
from the trust in the end,

12:31.290 --> 12:34.282
but I sure don't
have to make it easy.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.115
Okay.

12:43.000 --> 12:43.989
She's sick.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.820
Sick how?

12:45.830 --> 12:50.039
She's got, uh,
an autoimmune condition.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.668
She puts on a front
because she doesn't
want anyone to know,

12:52.670 --> 12:54.820
but she desperately
needs that money

12:54.830 --> 12:55.990
to cover
the medical bills.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.410
Well, I--

13:00.880 --> 13:02.199
That's a shame.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.285
I, uh...

13:06.920 --> 13:08.456
I really gotta get
back to work.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.076
Can I, uh...
Can I keep this?

13:16.080 --> 13:17.741
Sure, yeah.

13:45.830 --> 13:48.037
[cell phone buzzes]

13:48.040 --> 13:49.996
[line ringing]

13:52.120 --> 13:53.326
[buzzing]

13:53.330 --> 13:54.319
[beep]

14:05.210 --> 14:09.032
[camera clicking]

14:09.040 --> 14:10.951
-[click]
-[door closes]

14:10.960 --> 14:13.997
[engine starting]

14:31.290 --> 14:32.826
She stole my trash.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.378
[chuckles] Elaine.

14:35.380 --> 14:38.827
She can't control
herself when it comes
to her family, you know.

14:38.830 --> 14:40.320
Irony is,

14:41.710 --> 14:44.076
this is a gift.

14:44.080 --> 14:47.538
Yeah. She's
a regular Santa Claus.

14:49.670 --> 14:51.240
Bismark?

14:52.460 --> 14:54.872
Less than ten miles away.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.165
All this time.

14:56.170 --> 14:58.161
If he opted
to alert relatives,

14:58.170 --> 14:59.706
he must be
looking for family.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.110
Do you know
where he works?

15:10.290 --> 15:12.576
-Dale.
-Hey.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.662
This might be
out of line,

15:14.670 --> 15:16.820
but I need your advice.

15:23.420 --> 15:25.240
How can I help?

15:25.250 --> 15:28.538
I found Ben Pownall
at his family's cabin.

15:28.540 --> 15:31.247
He'd been partying for days
with a bunch of tweakers.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.786
And that girl,

15:32.790 --> 15:35.452
the suspect
in the Donnie Price murder,

15:35.460 --> 15:37.371
the one that knows Maddie?

15:37.380 --> 15:38.415
She was there.

15:38.420 --> 15:40.285
So what's your question?

15:40.290 --> 15:44.112
I was wondering
if there's anything
you haven't told me

15:44.120 --> 15:45.917
that might help me
make sense of all this.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.820
I turned in my badge,
Marissa,

15:47.830 --> 15:49.161
and I turned over
all the files.

15:49.170 --> 15:51.070
I'm not saying
that Maddie's involved,

15:51.080 --> 15:52.206
but she's got
a bleeding heart,

15:52.210 --> 15:54.417
and maybe she's
helping these people.

15:54.420 --> 15:57.241
My daughter is not mixed up
with a bunch of tweakers.

15:57.250 --> 15:59.957
Okay, I'm supposed
to give you this.

16:01.540 --> 16:02.609
It's from state.

16:04.540 --> 16:06.201
[papers rustling]

16:07.420 --> 16:09.240
[Dale]
A psych evaluation?

16:09.250 --> 16:10.239
Is this a joke?

16:10.250 --> 16:11.820
Tomorrow in Seattle?

16:11.830 --> 16:13.707
-This is--
-Ridiculous,

16:13.710 --> 16:15.200
and I want to help you,

16:15.210 --> 16:18.418
but unless you tell me
what's going on, I can't.

16:22.540 --> 16:23.700
Okay.

16:31.330 --> 16:33.707
[coughing]

16:38.460 --> 16:41.031
[breathing heavily]

16:52.290 --> 16:54.110
How long
before tank is ready?

16:54.120 --> 16:55.610
The problem is filling it.

16:55.620 --> 16:57.076
We need
a much more powerful pump

16:57.080 --> 16:58.456
at the rate
Ryn's degrading.

16:58.460 --> 17:01.452
If tank is not ready,
must go back in water.

17:01.460 --> 17:03.325
Ryn, it's not safe.

17:03.330 --> 17:05.412
Land not safe.

17:05.420 --> 17:08.287
IfI am weak,
there will be fight.

17:08.290 --> 17:10.110
Try to kill Ryn.

17:11.750 --> 17:13.206
I'm gonna go check
the hydrophone.

17:13.210 --> 17:15.201
Maybe something's changed.

17:17.920 --> 17:20.992
[loud pulsing sounds]

17:31.250 --> 17:34.538
-[power washer whirring]
-[music playing in earphones]

17:41.670 --> 17:42.705
Huh.

17:47.210 --> 17:50.111
This is 110 horsepower,

17:50.120 --> 17:52.168
enough to pump
the tank full
in under an hour.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.746
If we can make it work.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.991
This is gonna take
a miracle.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.492
Yeah. Well, luclq for us,
we got duct tape.

18:04.420 --> 18:07.742
It doesn't _make sense.
A psychiatric evaluation?

18:07.750 --> 18:09.377
Shots were fired.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.167
Brass is making everyone
involved see a shrink.

18:12.170 --> 18:14.035
You got shot in '08,

18:14.040 --> 18:16.372
and we didn't have to go
through anything like this.

18:16.380 --> 18:18.371
It's a different time,
honey.

18:18.380 --> 18:21.247
Well, if that's
what it takes to get past
all the nonsense, then...

18:21.250 --> 18:23.536
I'm not driving to Seattle
to stare at inkblots

18:23.540 --> 18:25.167
and justify myself.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.285
I'm needed here.

18:26.290 --> 18:27.496
To do what?

18:27.500 --> 18:29.491
To protect you and Maddie,
I told you.

18:31.460 --> 18:33.200
Is Maddie
in some kind of trouble?

18:33.210 --> 18:34.245
No.

18:38.540 --> 18:40.280
Where are you going?

18:40.290 --> 18:42.747
I will be right back.

18:42.750 --> 18:43.990
Don't worry.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.163
Dale, talk to me.

18:48.330 --> 18:50.457
Please tell me
what's gomg on.

18:50.460 --> 18:51.950
I want to help.

18:51.960 --> 18:55.202
I just need a day
to sort through some things.

18:55.210 --> 18:56.416
Everything will be fine,

18:57.420 --> 18:58.739
I promise.

19:04.420 --> 19:06.240
[sawing]

19:13.460 --> 19:14.199
[blows]

19:18.330 --> 19:20.537
[sighs] What do you think?

19:20.540 --> 19:23.327
Looks like a hardware store
threw up.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.537
A little optimism, please.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.666
[coughing]

19:37.920 --> 19:39.205
[cell phone ringing]

19:40.460 --> 19:41.609
[stops ringer]

19:41.620 --> 19:43.451
It's your mom again?

19:43.460 --> 19:44.700
Yeah.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.326
[cell phone ringing]

19:51.170 --> 19:54.287
Maggie, maybe it's
something important.

19:59.380 --> 20:00.824
Mom, is everything okay?

20:00.830 --> 20:03.116
Your dad,
he just took off.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.371
He wouldn't say
where he was going,

20:04.380 --> 20:05.495
and he took his gun.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.411
Dad takes his gun
to the dry cleaners.

20:07.420 --> 20:08.910
No, Maddie.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.740
His deputy, Marissa,
came by the house.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.320
She told him he
had to go to Seattle

20:12.330 --> 20:14.742
for a psychiatric evaluation.

20:14.750 --> 20:16.069
Okay?

20:16.080 --> 20:17.786
[Susan]
I'm worried about him.

20:17.790 --> 20:20.418
I'm sure Dad's_ fine.
He always IS.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.615
You can tell me
if he's not okay

20:22.620 --> 20:25.282
or if you're not.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.279
I'm your mom.

20:26.290 --> 20:27.826
If I'm not?
What does that--

20:27.830 --> 20:31.459
I know you both have been
keeping stuff from me.

20:31.460 --> 20:33.246
I want to help.

20:33.250 --> 20:34.615
I'm here for you, Mads.

20:34.620 --> 20:36.827
I want to do whatever I can.

20:36.830 --> 20:39.071
Look, I can't do this
with you right now.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.957
-We just went through this.
-No, Maddie!

20:40.960 --> 20:43.076
You're not part of this!
Mom, you have to back off.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.536
-I gotta go.
-God.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.371
Parenting the parent?

21:06.790 --> 21:07.779
Yeah.

21:12.380 --> 21:13.415
Hi.

21:16.960 --> 21:17.949
I don't know.

21:18.960 --> 21:21.451
Maybe you were right.

21:21.460 --> 21:24.418
This place, there's
something wrong with it.

21:29.210 --> 21:30.529
Can I see you?

21:44.580 --> 21:45.569
You.

21:45.580 --> 21:47.070
Okay?

21:47.080 --> 21:48.570
Yes.

21:48.580 --> 21:49.911
Okay.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.706
I teach you.

22:11.250 --> 22:12.956
It's okay! It's okay!

22:12.960 --> 22:14.029
Family!

22:14.040 --> 22:15.029
[hisses]

22:17.880 --> 22:19.825
-[hiss]
-[hiss]

22:21.620 --> 22:23.997
Is everything okay?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.537
Yeah, Marissa
came by the house.

22:26.540 --> 22:28.997
She had a lot of questions.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.376
We have things
under control now.

22:30.380 --> 22:31.574
Thought your text said

22:31.580 --> 22:33.571
this was a better cover
than the cabin.

22:33.580 --> 22:35.787
It's a temporary solution.

22:35.790 --> 22:37.371
I talked to Mom.

22:37.380 --> 22:40.076
She told me
about this thing in Seattle.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.490
Do I seem crazy to you?

22:41.500 --> 22:42.660
Of course not,

22:42.670 --> 22:43.785
but you're going, right?

22:43.790 --> 22:45.030
No!

22:45.040 --> 22:46.416
Dad, you could be fired.

22:48.170 --> 22:50.616
You always say it's your job
to protect this town.

22:50.620 --> 22:51.826
Isn't the best way to do that

22:51.830 --> 22:53.570
for you to go get
your badge back?

22:53.580 --> 22:56.663
Yeah, but what if something
happens while I'm away?

22:56.670 --> 22:58.456
Marissa could find you here.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.530
We'll be very careful.

23:00.540 --> 23:02.076
But sooner or later,

23:02.080 --> 23:03.957
we are gonna need
your help again, Dad.

23:08.500 --> 23:10.070
Updates.

23:10.080 --> 23:11.616
Every few hours or I stay.

23:11.620 --> 23:12.609
Of course.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.707
[music playing]

23:54.580 --> 23:55.990
[Ben] Okay.

24:00.380 --> 24:01.495
We're ready.

24:03.670 --> 24:06.457
[engine sputters]

24:08.460 --> 24:09.916

24:09.920 --> 24:12.286
-[starts]
-[laughing]

24:12.290 --> 24:14.747
Come on. Yes!

24:15.790 --> 24:17.326
-[Ben] Yeah!
-[laughs]

24:18.330 --> 24:19.410
Hey, hey.

24:21.670 --> 24:23.410
Whoo!

24:23.420 --> 24:24.489
All right.

24:25.750 --> 24:26.489
[Ben sighs]

24:29.580 --> 24:31.491
How far does it
have to fill?

24:31.500 --> 24:32.615
All the way.

24:32.620 --> 24:34.326
God, I hope this works.

24:36.330 --> 24:37.376
Where's Ryn?

24:39.960 --> 24:41.450
I'll go find her.

24:47.580 --> 24:50.071
Hey, can I help you?

24:50.080 --> 24:51.616
Oh, I'm looking
for Ben Pownall.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.202
I'm Ian Sutton,
KFGT News.

24:54.210 --> 24:55.780
Are you Ben?

24:55.790 --> 24:57.417
I'm, uh,
here doing a story

24:57.420 --> 24:59.411
about those beached whales
from last week.

24:59.420 --> 25:02.321
I thought you might be able
to give me some background.

25:02.330 --> 25:03.957
Uh, it's not a good time.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.075
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.786
I should have called first.

25:06.790 --> 25:08.576
Look, I just need
a quick quote.

25:08.580 --> 25:10.787
My producer's
all over my ass
about this story.

25:10.790 --> 25:13.031
You know, animal tragedy
always does big numbers.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.076
World we live in.

25:15.080 --> 25:18.038
All right. Well, uh,
we just got a ton
of new rescues in.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.746
Would that be connected
to the whales?

25:22.170 --> 25:23.740
I gotta get some stuff
from my car

25:23.750 --> 25:24.990
and get right back to it,

25:25.000 --> 25:27.787
but if you want
to walk with me...

25:27.790 --> 25:29.200
I can work with that.

25:30.710 --> 25:32.371
So what's
the current theory

25:32.380 --> 25:33.950
-on what caused
the whale beaching?
-[gasping]

25:33.960 --> 25:35.825
[Ben]
It's not a theory.

25:35.830 --> 25:37.786
Klesco Oil is looking
for their next big hit.

25:37.790 --> 25:39.781
They're tearing
our ecosystem apart.

25:39.790 --> 25:41.496
[Ian] Shit.
You sure about this?

25:41.500 --> 25:43.786
Just look up "sonic cannon."

25:43.790 --> 25:45.451
That'll tell you
everything you need to know.

25:45.460 --> 25:48.281
It's nice to know
not all the news
is fake around here.

25:48.290 --> 25:50.747
You know some nut actually
tried to convince me

25:50.750 --> 25:52.820
that Bristol Cove mermaids
were real the other day?

25:52.830 --> 25:55.663
Now I got
a contact in my phone
for "Crazy Calvin."

25:56.750 --> 25:58.377
[uneasy laugh]

25:58.380 --> 26:01.747
Well, uh, don't
judge our whole town
on one whack job.

26:01.750 --> 26:04.457
I'm sure it's
more than just one.

26:04.460 --> 26:05.950
They usually travel
in packs.

26:16.670 --> 26:20.288
[struggling for breath]

26:22.750 --> 26:24.820
[growling]

26:28.670 --> 26:30.820
You weak.

26:30.830 --> 26:32.821
Become like human.

26:32.830 --> 26:34.320
[wheezing]

26:34.330 --> 26:36.878
Human kill us.

26:36.880 --> 26:40.247
I will not be human!

26:40.250 --> 26:42.878
[Jerry] Oh, hey, Ryn.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.871
Didn't know you were here.

26:44.880 --> 26:48.498
Sorry. I guess these guys
are finally hungry.

26:51.580 --> 26:52.569
Bye.

26:53.710 --> 26:56.497
Get in water! Now!

26:56.500 --> 26:58.161
-[pantin
-Aah! g]

27:01.710 --> 27:02.745
Ryn!

27:04.420 --> 27:05.990
[both grunting]

27:12.830 --> 27:17.073
[muffled screams]

27:18.830 --> 27:23.779
[piercing shrieks]

27:39.080 --> 27:40.320
-[hiss]
-[growl]

27:44.880 --> 27:46.199
[muffled shout]

27:54.960 --> 28:01.786
[ethereal Siren song echoing]

28:05.790 --> 28:07.200
[loud thrashing]

28:09.830 --> 28:11.707
Ben!No!

28:11.710 --> 28:13.246
Ben! Ben, no!

28:13.250 --> 28:14.410
-Ryn!
-Ben!

28:15.920 --> 28:17.876
-[hisses]
-[angry growl]

28:17.880 --> 28:19.370
Oh!

28:19.380 --> 28:20.950
Ben!

28:28.880 --> 28:32.668
[Siren song echoing]

29:20.620 --> 29:22.076
[sighs]

29:40.080 --> 29:42.537
Ryn, are you okay?

29:42.540 --> 29:43.916
Not Ben's fight!

29:43.920 --> 29:45.035
My fight!

29:45.040 --> 29:46.530
You could have died
in there.

29:46.540 --> 29:48.246
Then I die.

29:48.250 --> 29:49.239
This is our way.

29:49.250 --> 29:51.115
Ben cannot choose.

30:13.710 --> 30:15.075
She will die.

30:16.540 --> 30:18.917
Ryn told us
we couldn't stop the fight,

30:18.920 --> 30:20.069
but you tried anyway.

30:20.080 --> 30:23.117
Were you hearing it again,
hersong?

30:23.120 --> 30:24.109
In your mind?

30:28.080 --> 30:29.991
I, uh--
I need to clear my head.

30:32.420 --> 30:33.705
[door opens]

30:35.330 --> 30:36.410
[door closes]

30:43.920 --> 30:45.205
Hello.

30:46.210 --> 30:47.495
Are you Rick?

30:47.500 --> 30:49.991
-Why? You a cop?
-[chuckles]

30:50.000 --> 30:51.615
I'm Helen Hawkins.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.285
We've never met,

30:54.290 --> 30:57.077
and I know this
might sound really crazy,

30:57.080 --> 30:59.071
but I think
you've been looking for me.

30:59.080 --> 31:01.071
Uh, you got the wrong guy.

31:01.080 --> 31:04.618
Uh, I did an online DNA test.

31:04.620 --> 31:06.167
Maybe you did, too?

31:07.580 --> 31:11.038
When I saw that you were
looking for family,

31:11.040 --> 31:11.870
I had to come.

31:13.210 --> 31:14.916
Yeah, that was
a few years ago.

31:14.920 --> 31:17.787
I guess I checked
that little, uh,

31:17.790 --> 31:19.166
"find me" box.

31:19.170 --> 31:21.411
Yeah. Me, too.

31:21.420 --> 31:23.285
And here we are--

31:23.290 --> 31:24.370
relatives.

31:28.040 --> 31:30.076
[pots clattering]

31:31.880 --> 31:33.245
I gotta head inside.

31:36.580 --> 31:38.992
Stop by my shop sometime.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.821
Helen's Antiquities
in Bristol Cove.

31:41.830 --> 31:43.411
I can tell you
more about my family.

31:43.420 --> 31:45.035
Well-- [laughs]

31:45.040 --> 31:46.576
Our family.

32:01.330 --> 32:02.376
I'm sorry.

32:06.380 --> 32:08.951
It's not Ben's fault.

32:08.960 --> 32:09.949
He's struggling.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.166
Your song
is in his head.

32:14.330 --> 32:17.037
Song is poison.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.246
Like plant.

32:18.250 --> 32:21.617
No, it's
definitely not poison.

32:21.620 --> 32:24.111
Maybe medicine help Ben.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.200
Heal.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.030
Like our plants.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.610
I don't know.

32:28.620 --> 32:30.030
I don't understand it.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.780
Maybe that's
what we need to do.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.160
Figure out what it means.

32:36.540 --> 32:39.202
[tapping]

32:39.210 --> 32:40.529
Say something into it.

32:40.540 --> 32:42.167
Something into it.

32:47.670 --> 32:49.160
What is this?

32:49.170 --> 32:52.037
We'll use it
to record your song.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.871
Then we're gonna
compare it to
some other sounds

32:53.880 --> 32:55.165
made by animals
in the ocean.

32:55.170 --> 32:56.990
If we find
another sound like it,

32:57.000 --> 32:58.740
we might be able to figure
out how we can block it.

32:58.750 --> 33:01.287
Ben will be safe
when I sing?

33:01.290 --> 33:03.781
Uh, we're
not gonna be in here.

33:03.790 --> 33:05.246
We're gonna set it
to record,

33:05.250 --> 33:07.036
and then we're
gonna leave the room.

33:07.040 --> 33:10.112
If you leave,
who do I sing to?

33:10.120 --> 33:12.998
The machine.
It captures sound.

33:15.290 --> 33:19.249
Song only comes
when I sing to a human.

33:35.920 --> 33:37.456
[exhales]

33:49.710 --> 33:51.246
Maddie will be safe?

33:51.250 --> 33:52.319
From my song?

33:52.330 --> 33:55.072
These block out
all the sound.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.280
[click]

34:00.290 --> 34:01.279
Are we ready?

34:12.290 --> 34:17.990
[singing Siren song]

34:55.000 --> 35:00.916
[singing final notes
of Siren song]

35:10.670 --> 35:12.114
Maddie's okay?

35:14.420 --> 35:16.615
Maddie is, uh, [laughs]

35:16.620 --> 35:18.030
okay.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.160
What does it feel like

35:30.670 --> 35:31.739
when you sing?

35:33.750 --> 35:36.378
Makes me feel good.

35:40.290 --> 35:42.281
After I sing to Ben...

35:45.000 --> 35:46.069
What is it?

35:49.420 --> 35:51.035
I need it.

35:53.330 --> 35:55.992
I want to sing.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.457
Maybe we shouldn't
tell him that.

36:06.250 --> 36:08.320
Keep it a secret.

36:08.330 --> 36:10.286
Between us.

36:10.290 --> 36:12.246
You are afraid for him.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.376
Secret.

36:26.380 --> 36:28.575
Like sister.

36:28.580 --> 36:30.616
How she die.

36:30.620 --> 36:33.111
I keep
from sister's daughter.

36:33.120 --> 36:34.610
Yes.

36:34.620 --> 36:35.746
Just like that.

36:37.960 --> 36:40.326
It's what's best, I think,

36:40.330 --> 36:41.536
for Ben.

36:46.380 --> 36:49.326
[disturbed moaning]

36:49.330 --> 36:51.457
[gaSPSI

36:51.460 --> 36:52.245
Hey.

36:53.330 --> 36:56.572
Oh... Oh, damn.

36:56.580 --> 36:59.378
Hey. Bad dream?

36:59.380 --> 37:01.325
Yeah.

37:01.330 --> 37:03.207
You _can tell me
about It, you know?

37:04.330 --> 37:06.070
Huh.No.

37:06.080 --> 37:09.379
Have you having nightmares
about my dad, too? Yeah, no.

37:09.380 --> 37:10.449
No, thanks.

37:10.460 --> 37:11.779
Why don't you tell me more

37:11.790 --> 37:13.530
about what happened
that night?

37:13.540 --> 37:15.417
Maybe it'll help.

37:15.420 --> 37:18.241
You do not want inside my head
with all that, trust me.

37:18.250 --> 37:21.458
Yeah, well,
I don't want you to be
in there alone, either.

37:25.170 --> 37:27.240
I know
that it was an accident.

37:27.250 --> 37:29.491
Did you see it happen?

37:29.500 --> 37:30.660
[sniffs]

37:30.670 --> 37:32.410
I was ten feet
away from hIm.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.746
You saw him go over?

37:37.290 --> 37:38.325
Yeah.

37:41.540 --> 37:42.666
Yeah, I saw him.

37:47.670 --> 37:49.911
He didn't stand a chance.

37:51.540 --> 37:52.746
And me, I just...

37:54.750 --> 37:56.320
I didn't do anything
to stop it.

37:59.790 --> 38:02.372
It wasn't
your fault, Xander.

38:02.380 --> 38:05.497
It was an accident.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.821
Accidents happen.

38:07.830 --> 38:08.990
Please, just-just-just...

38:09.000 --> 38:11.412
just stop saying
that word, okay?

38:11.420 --> 38:12.489
What?

38:12.500 --> 38:14.206
Okay.

38:14.210 --> 38:16.030
It wasn't a damn accident.

38:20.620 --> 38:22.417
Dad was murdered.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.075
By who?

38:35.500 --> 38:37.036
I didn't see his face.

38:39.580 --> 38:41.161
[sniffs]

38:41.170 --> 38:44.458
There were other boats
on the water that night.

38:44.460 --> 38:47.418
The guy must have came
from one of them.

38:59.250 --> 39:00.990
Everything okay?

39:01.000 --> 39:03.457
The readings aren't
like anything I've ever seen.

39:03.460 --> 39:04.666
Did you hear anything?

39:04.670 --> 39:07.457
No, but we got it.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.371
Everything okay?

39:14.620 --> 39:15.609
Yes.

39:15.620 --> 39:18.282
Maddie say my song is

39:20.540 --> 39:21.746
recorded.

39:21.750 --> 39:24.708
No need sing anymore.

39:27.540 --> 39:29.496
I go back to others.

39:29.500 --> 39:30.740
Sleep.

39:46.670 --> 39:47.659
[beep]

39:47.670 --> 39:50.070
[line ringing]

39:50.080 --> 39:51.456
Hey, it's Ben.
Leave a message.

39:51.460 --> 39:54.111
-[beeps]
-It's Helen.

39:54.120 --> 39:58.113
I don't know what changed
your mom's mind,

39:58.120 --> 40:00.168
but I am staring at a check,

40:02.710 --> 40:04.280
and I found Rick Marzdan.

40:05.620 --> 40:08.498
Now I have to figure out
how to tell him.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.326
[groaning]

40:30.500 --> 40:33.207
[gasping]

40:44.170 --> 40:47.822
[female singer]
There's a storm

40:47.830 --> 40:49.786
Thunder and lightning

40:49.790 --> 40:54.033
Dear, in your

40:54.040 --> 40:55.746
Eyes it's frightening

40:55.750 --> 40:57.570
-[pounding]
-Damn it!

41:05.750 --> 41:10.289
All my life

41:10.290 --> 41:11.780
I'm trying to get it right

41:11.790 --> 41:15.612
You came in

41:15.620 --> 41:17.531
And you took me by surprise

41:17.540 --> 41:21.613
Now I'm drowning

41:21.620 --> 41:23.702
Under the weight of your

41:23.710 --> 41:27.703
Pre-cious crimes

41:27.710 --> 41:30.531
My body's sinking

41:30.540 --> 41:32.747
[placid high-pitched call]

41:37.790 --> 41:40.497
[music playing]
