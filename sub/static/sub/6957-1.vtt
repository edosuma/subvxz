01:26:39.236 --> 01:26:41.404
And for what you've done

01:26:41.405 --> 01:26:44.749
I'm giving you your
dream in return.

01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:47.995
But it's just for tonight.

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:50.830
Sort of a Cinderella deal.

01:26:50.831 --> 01:26:52.748
So I have until midnight?

01:26:52.749 --> 01:26:54.125
Ten.

01:26:54.126 --> 01:26:57.254
Hey! Cinderella got until midnight.

01:26:57.671 --> 01:27:00.594
Cinderella wasn't 12 years old.

01:27:11.768 --> 01:27:14.145
(SENTIMENTAL POP SONG PLAYING)

01:28:50.784 --> 01:28:53.707
I told you I was a good dancer.

01:28:54.496 --> 01:28:56.623
Can I keep you?

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:02.257
Casper?

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:29.155
(SENTIMENTAL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

01:29:44.296 --> 01:29:46.343
Hello, James.

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:51.723
Amelia.

01:29:53.096 --> 01:29:55.223
It's all right.

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:59.272
It's just me.

01:30:04.566 --> 01:30:08.411
I thought I'd have a hundred
things to say when I...

01:30:11.156 --> 01:30:12.703
How?

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:18.038
Let's just say you know three
crazy ghosts who kept their word.

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:23.542
James, I know you've
been searching for me.

01:30:23.543 --> 01:30:26.795
But there's something
you have to understand.

01:30:26.796 --> 01:30:29.840
You and Kat loved me so
well when I was alive

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:32.551
that I have no unfinished business.

01:30:32.552 --> 01:30:35.095
Please don't let me be yours.

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:37.189
But, Amelia

01:30:39.809 --> 01:30:41.481
I don't...

01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:45.114
I don't really know what I'm doing.

01:30:46.399 --> 01:30:48.651
What parent does?

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:53.782
James, Kat is growing up
beautifully because of you.

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:57.835
No wonder I miss you so much.

01:30:59.663 --> 01:31:02.586
Just a couple of things, though.

01:31:02.666 --> 01:31:06.636
Don't pick up the extension every
time she gets a phone call.

01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:10.094
French fries are not
a breakfast food.

01:31:10.423 --> 01:31:13.217
And don't ask her to
wear a T-shirt under...

01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:15.766
Under her bathing suit.

01:31:16.179 --> 01:31:17.976
I know.

01:31:18.264 --> 01:31:21.688
- Our daughter is a teenager.

(CLOCK CHIMING)

01:31:47.794 --> 01:31:49.511
Wait.

01:31:50.422 --> 01:31:52.799
Where are you going?

01:31:53.717 --> 01:31:57.892
Where I can watch over both of
you until we're together again.

01:32:01.558 --> 01:32:03.776
Good-bye, James.

Not bad for my first party, huh?

01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:12.669
Couldn't have been better.

01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:14.338
It ain't over yet.
