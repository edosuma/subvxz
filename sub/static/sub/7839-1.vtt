01:33.760 --> 01:36.440
A real nail-biter here at Mile High Stadium.

01:36.440 --> 01:40.240
The broncos down by one, and 30 
seconds left on the clock.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.770
Come on, Broncos, you can do it.

01:43.790 --> 01:45.430
And I'm joined in the broadcast booth

01:45.430 --> 01:50.160
by the stars of ABC's latest reality 
show, billionaire versus bear.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.580
Let's review the easy-to-follow 
rules of your show.

01:52.830 --> 01:54.320
Each of you thought you were in a race

01:54.320 --> 01:57.310
to plant the taco bell flag at the north pole.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.990
What you didn't know is, the race was a chase,

02:00.070 --> 02:03.070
spiced up by the presence of the betrayer.

02:05.490 --> 02:07.720
Well, now, the bear has a surprise for you.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.479
He's not really a bear, he's a tiger!

02:10.750 --> 02:11.620
Ho! Lookie there!

02:11.620 --> 02:13.030
Denver just won the ballgame!

02:15.380 --> 02:17.040
Oh, the Broncos won?

02:17.480 --> 02:20.950
Why didn't I bet on them like 
professor pigskin told me to?

02:21.190 --> 02:22.510
Who's professor pigskin?

02:22.760 --> 02:26.100
He's a pig who can predict 
football winners in advance!

02:26.670 --> 02:28.020
How is that possible?

02:28.180 --> 02:31.120
Because he's got something no gambler's ever had:

02:31.450 --> 02:32.280
A system!

02:32.670 --> 02:34.400
I've gotten the pamphlet four weeks in a row,

02:34.400 --> 02:37.160
and every time, the pick-of-the-week 
has been right on the money.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.490
Ah... I get it.

02:39.670 --> 02:42.110
Every week, they send out two 
pamphlets, half picking

02:42.110 --> 02:43.710
one team and half picking the other.

02:43.780 --> 02:45.620
Eventually, there's a small group of people

02:45.620 --> 02:47.490
who only receive the correct predictions

02:47.490 --> 02:49.770
and think professor pigskin is always right.

02:50.230 --> 02:52.100
That's when they ask for your money.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.650
I have money!

02:53.790 --> 02:55.460
Dad, it's a scam!

02:55.670 --> 02:59.390
A scam?! Not according to Eddie F. From Tucson,

02:59.390 --> 03:02.230
or football millionaire in Beloit, Michigan.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.160
Look, all I'm saying is, you really 
should think twice before...

03:05.330 --> 03:07.540
Expiration date: 06/08.

03:10.130 --> 03:12.030
Oh, professor pigskin told me

03:12.030 --> 03:14.110
to bet on the Raiders, but they look awful!

03:14.280 --> 03:16.180
And with 37 starting players

03:16.180 --> 03:17.940
out with the flu, the Oakland Raiders

03:17.940 --> 03:20.900
have turned to drunks conscripted from local bars.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.100
Spare some change, football dude?

03:26.370 --> 03:27.200
Now, you have a good day.

03:28.540 --> 03:30.560
Dad, how much money did you bet?

03:30.850 --> 03:32.800
Hey, I didn't bet any of our money.

03:33.010 --> 03:34.770
I just borrowed some from him.

03:35.810 --> 03:39.810
Don't worry, we can hammer out a payment plan.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.700
It's not my fault the Raiders lost!

03:43.880 --> 03:45.350
It's professor pigskin's!

03:45.490 --> 03:48.860
If he mentions that pig again, use two hammers.

03:49.030 --> 03:49.740
But the pig...

03:51.020 --> 03:53.670
Now, i do have a way we could settle this debt.

03:54.170 --> 03:56.930
We would like to use your home 
to shoot an adult film.

03:57.510 --> 03:58.790
Yeah, it's called lemony lick-it:

03:59.030 --> 04:00.980
A series of horny events.

04:01.930 --> 04:02.840
Marge would kill me!

04:03.150 --> 04:05.600
Please! There's got to be something else I can do.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.970
Like mow your lawn every week for two weeks.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.530
I can't do it next week.

04:11.070 --> 04:11.470
All right!

04:11.810 --> 04:14.000
You can shoot your gay adult film at my house.

04:14.130 --> 04:16.029
I didn't say anything about gay.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.970
I thought you guys were the gay mafia.

04:19.450 --> 04:22.400
They're shooting an adult film at my house tomorrow.

04:22.660 --> 04:24.670
How am I gonna get rid of marge and the kids?

04:25.070 --> 04:27.180
Well, I got these free tickets to santa's village.

04:27.370 --> 04:29.420
I know a guy who turns the dead

04:29.420 --> 04:31.510
sleigh horses into jerky and sells it to bars.

04:34.960 --> 04:35.940
Thanks, Moe!

04:36.980 --> 04:39.210
Why would we want to go to santa's village?

04:39.350 --> 04:40.240
It's august.

04:40.340 --> 04:41.450
I want to see santa--

04:41.610 --> 04:43.810
he can explain why he gave 
me a playstation box

04:43.810 --> 04:45.590
with nothing inside but a coloring book.

04:45.730 --> 04:47.160
It got your hopes up, didn't it?

04:48.240 --> 04:50.460
Homer, before I take the kids,

04:50.650 --> 04:52.980
I want you to swear you're not up to something.

04:53.180 --> 04:54.160
I swear.

04:54.430 --> 04:58.070
And I'd also like to know why 
your hand is in that cast.

04:59.350 --> 05:03.750
Because you look even more beautiful 
now than the day I married you.

05:11.080 --> 05:13.600
Welcome to santa's village, 
where it's christmas every day.

05:13.920 --> 05:14.780
Closed on christmas.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.370
Those reindeer look really uncomfortable.

05:18.580 --> 05:21.070
That's because they don't 
thrive in this environment!

05:22.400 --> 05:23.290
Watcha reading, Santa?

05:23.570 --> 05:25.160
Tom clancy's op-center.

05:25.230 --> 05:26.470
You don't seem very jolly.

05:27.140 --> 05:29.070
Well, santa got some bad medical news.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.660
And... action!

05:35.790 --> 05:39.140
We've been on this spaceship for a hundred years.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.440
When will we ever get to planet satisfaction?

05:42.570 --> 05:43.370
Hey, Homer, we..

05:44.430 --> 05:45.260
Angela Dare!

05:45.260 --> 05:47.060
Sultry Stevens !

05:47.400 --> 05:50.360
Yeah, what is this, a reunion 
of Fahrenheit 9 on 1?

05:50.600 --> 05:51.830
Guys! Get out of here!

05:51.950 --> 05:53.530
Homer, how'd you ever get Marge

05:53.530 --> 05:54.480
to go along with this?

05:54.890 --> 05:56.630
Look, if you promise never to tell her,

05:56.790 --> 05:57.820
I'll let you be in the movie.

05:57.990 --> 06:00.390
We just came over to borrow 
a board game, but okay.

06:00.580 --> 06:02.900
I've always dreamed of 
working in an adult film.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.110
I'll run the sound board!

06:04.440 --> 06:06.010
And I'll perform in the sex scenes!

06:09.520 --> 06:10.880
Merry christmas!

06:11.070 --> 06:14.020
I'm your old pal frosty the snowman!

06:14.170 --> 06:15.260
In your dreams.

06:15.380 --> 06:16.860
Frosty!

06:17.200 --> 06:18.580
Where's your magic top hat?

06:18.910 --> 06:21.220
Oh, god, please don't tell mr. Roselli

06:21.220 --> 06:22.780
I lost my hat again!

06:26.680 --> 06:29.070
My christmas present to myself this year

06:29.070 --> 06:30.860
was leaving that place early.

06:31.110 --> 06:31.870
Mom...

06:31.870 --> 06:34.750
I got a rash where the reindeer licked me.

06:35.890 --> 06:37.510
When they put santa in the ambulance,

06:37.580 --> 06:39.860
why'd they pull the blanket all 
the way up over his head?

06:40.070 --> 06:42.530
Now, look, I know this wasn't 
the greatest outing,

06:42.710 --> 06:45.990
but your father meant well, so 
don't let him know that we didn't...

06:49.520 --> 06:51.150
Are you guys almost done?

06:51.500 --> 06:55.050
Listen, I got a tattoo of foghorn 
leghorn on my right thigh.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.620
Are we gonna get into any trademark 
or copyright issues here?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.300
'Cause we could put a band-aid on it

07:00.300 --> 07:02.150
and say my character just got stabbed.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.440
Relax, three guys'll put their hands on it, okay?

07:04.580 --> 07:06.980
Now, everybody is very much in love.

07:07.250 --> 07:08.550
And... action!

07:08.710 --> 07:12.290
Homer! Is this a snuggle film?

07:13.730 --> 07:14.900
You're in the wrong house, lady!

07:15.180 --> 07:18.660
How could you allow this, 
in the room where we do puzzles!

07:22.500 --> 07:25.260
Honey, please, just listen 
to what I have to say.

07:25.430 --> 07:26.250
All right.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.980
I owed the mafia money.

07:29.470 --> 07:30.220
Where are you going?

07:30.270 --> 07:31.180
Away from you.

07:31.370 --> 07:32.110
When will you be back?

07:32.140 --> 07:32.780
I don't know.

07:32.810 --> 07:33.850
Who's going to watch the kids?

07:33.890 --> 07:34.580
You are.

07:34.750 --> 07:36.830
Me? But I'm the father!

07:41.480 --> 07:44.140
Boy, Homer, I've never 
see mom this mad.

07:44.420 --> 07:45.410
Honey, come back!

07:45.790 --> 07:47.600
You didn't say bye to the kids!

07:48.380 --> 07:49.350
Bye, Bart.

07:50.130 --> 07:51.650
I love you, Lisa.

07:52.450 --> 07:53.890
Sleep tight, Maggie.

07:54.990 --> 07:57.680
Today's the last day you can 
eat the yogurt in the fridge.

07:58.990 --> 08:01.180
Well, we better go eat that yogurt.

08:05.720 --> 08:08.110
It's dinnertime.

08:08.260 --> 08:10.030
Look, we've been down this road before.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.460
I do something stupid you mom 
leaves, we eat waffles.

08:13.770 --> 08:14.670
We're out of waffles.

08:14.710 --> 08:15.690
All we got is ketchup.

08:15.870 --> 08:19.040
You mean Homer's famous marinara sauce?

08:19.310 --> 08:20.230
No, I mean ketchup.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.140
Where's your sense of magic and wonder?!

08:25.240 --> 08:26.000
Come on, Marge.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
When are you going to call?

08:28.620 --> 08:30.410
Let it ring, play hard to get.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.230
That's hard enough!

08:31.670 --> 08:32.620
Oh, my darling, I love you!

08:32.650 --> 08:33.289
Please forgive me!

08:33.460 --> 08:33.929
Hey, Homer.

08:34.090 --> 08:35.640
Moe, what are you calling me for?

08:35.789 --> 08:38.260
You told me to call. You wanted 
to see if your phone was working.

08:38.570 --> 08:41.140
But what if marge tries to 
call while I'm talking to you?

08:41.309 --> 08:42.309
Ain't you got call waiting?

08:42.640 --> 08:44.820
Of course, I have call waiting, you idiot!

08:44.900 --> 08:46.630
I just never learned how to use it!

08:48.060 --> 08:48.890
I might have broken the phone.

08:49.200 --> 08:49.960
I better call Moe.

08:52.520 --> 08:53.090
Hey, Homer.

08:53.210 --> 08:55.010
Moe, will you get off the line?!

09:07.270 --> 09:09.610
I guess I better tell them I'm coming home.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.160
Marge, what a pleasant surprise.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.540
I'm at a rest stop south of Springfield.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.280
I know. You're sorry now.

09:23.700 --> 09:25.620
Then you'll buy me some Quickie Mart Flowers,

09:25.620 --> 09:27.970
maybe a box of candy, where half the pieces

09:27.970 --> 09:30.790
mysteriously have testing bites,

09:30.990 --> 09:34.030
and a week later you'll be back 
to your old thoughtless self.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.890
No, no, it's not going to 
be like that, I swear.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.040
Lemon cream.

09:40.220 --> 09:41.300
You're going in the Marge pile.

09:41.470 --> 09:43.900
I mean, I love you so much.

09:44.370 --> 09:46.040
Yeah, I love you, too.

09:47.540 --> 09:48.010
Hold on.

09:48.010 --> 09:49.050
I'll be off in a minute.

09:50.430 --> 09:53.460
Listen, buster, I had to buy 
a club soda I didn't want

09:53.460 --> 09:55.030
to get change for this phone.

09:55.940 --> 09:57.050
An oogly-boogly!

10:00.570 --> 10:01.120
Be still.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.710
Don't give it the phone.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.910
Settle down, sugar plum.

10:05.340 --> 10:06.960
Look what daddy's got in his pocket.

10:07.290 --> 10:08.740
Yummy, yummy kelp.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.950
Good girl, yes, yes.

10:15.270 --> 10:17.110
This animal means you no harm.

10:17.370 --> 10:19.460
She's a sweet old Florida manatee,

10:19.750 --> 10:21.890
also known as a sea cow or dugong.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.380
Hello, Marge, where do we keep the 
socks that don't smell like feet?

10:25.690 --> 10:27.100
I'll call you back.

10:29.580 --> 10:32.130
I'm Dr. Caleb Thorn, and I would do anything

10:32.130 --> 10:35.370
to protect a manatee except 
harm another manatee.

10:35.470 --> 10:39.180
What if by harming a manatee 
you could save two manatees?

10:39.610 --> 10:41.580
But before you answer, consider this:

10:42.100 --> 10:44.660
The manatee you have to harm is pregnant.

10:45.410 --> 10:47.970
Those are the questions that 
keep me up at night.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.434
I see a manatee the needs a hug.

11:01.084 --> 11:02.247
Hello, Marge?

11:02.485 --> 11:04.011
Does the pizza guy take a check?

11:04.023 --> 11:05.843
If so, where do we keep the checks?

11:06.020 --> 11:07.886
And lastly, how do you write a check?

11:10.272 --> 11:12.605
I think the worst part was when I realized

11:12.630 --> 11:14.044
that homer lied to me.

11:15.119 --> 11:16.525
From what you've told me,

11:16.537 --> 11:17.697
it sounds like what your husband did

11:17.709 --> 11:18.597
is nothing new.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.123
Exactly.

11:20.202 --> 11:21.961
I have a saying which goes,

11:21.990 --> 11:23.643
"you can't teach a manatee any tricks."

11:23.667 --> 11:26.122
Maybe you could just put a hat 
on him and say it's a trick.

11:26.171 --> 11:29.810
My point is Homer is the exact 
same man you married,

11:29.838 --> 11:33.373
and if there's a problem here, it's that 
you keep expecting him to change.

11:34.364 --> 11:37.583
He cares so much about those doggone dugongs.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.810
I wish I felt that kind of passion.

11:39.897 --> 11:41.833
Maybe I should join him on his mission.

11:42.287 --> 11:43.767
Hey, lady blue, while you're sitting there

11:43.792 --> 11:45.974
staring at the ceiling, you boyfriend's

11:46.036 --> 11:48.108
in the parking lot with his hands in a walrus.

11:52.114 --> 11:54.247
Yeah, that'll be good for business.

11:56.463 --> 11:57.400
Got to find your mom.

11:57.413 --> 11:58.363
Got to find your mom.

11:58.388 --> 11:59.202
Dad, I promise

11:59.226 --> 11:59.991
I'll be good.

12:00.016 --> 12:01.463
Can I get out of the dog carrier?

12:01.604 --> 12:02.738
It was hard enough getting you in there.

12:02.763 --> 12:03.737
I'm not letting you out.

12:04.613 --> 12:05.747
Yeah, she came through here.

12:06.006 --> 12:10.142
I believe she was looking to 
rekindle her passion for life.

12:10.290 --> 12:11.159
Ain't that right, victor?

12:11.233 --> 12:11.671
Oh, yes.

12:11.891 --> 12:12.989
Senora left for the coast

12:13.001 --> 12:15.017
with a rugged, yet sensitive man of science.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.460
Rugged? Is that the same as handsome?

12:17.549 --> 12:18.560
Oh, no, no.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.225
"Handsome" means he look at himself

12:20.237 --> 12:23.037
in the mirror all day. "Rugged" 
means you look at him.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.131
Okay, water monsters, be friendly...

12:34.120 --> 12:35.452
but not too friendly.

12:39.164 --> 12:40.113
What do I do?

12:40.189 --> 12:41.073
Talk to it!

12:41.207 --> 12:42.453
Let it know you're not a threat.

12:42.788 --> 12:47.191
Oh, okay. You know, up close 
you're kinda cute.

12:49.959 --> 12:51.032
You're a good thing.

12:51.045 --> 12:51.846
I know it.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.430
Let me clean out your ears.

12:59.075 --> 13:01.163
I've bonded with him!

13:06.519 --> 13:07.910
Where is he taking me?

13:07.938 --> 13:09.562
To his underwater palace.

13:09.594 --> 13:10.630
Just kidding.

13:10.643 --> 13:12.218
It's a lagoon full of bugs.

13:18.974 --> 13:21.194
Dad, I don't think we're 
going to find mom today.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.357
And I'm sick of eating 
at restaurant chains

13:23.381 --> 13:27.348
I've never even heard of like 
Skobo's and Dim Willie'S.

13:28.755 --> 13:30.599
Okay, kids, we'll stop for the day.

13:30.745 --> 13:32.041
I have cousins near here.

13:32.161 --> 13:33.083
We'll stay with them.

13:33.103 --> 13:33.987
Country cousins?

13:34.039 --> 13:34.657
Are they rubes?

13:34.682 --> 13:35.966
'Cause I don't cotton to rubes.

13:36.111 --> 13:37.454
The rubiest.

13:37.629 --> 13:39.735
Look, a new restaurant chain.

13:40.599 --> 13:42.703
Can we say it's my birthday 
and get free stuff?

13:42.737 --> 13:45.178
We'll say it's all our birthdays.

13:45.609 --> 13:47.829
I cannot believe it.

13:51.417 --> 13:53.487
Cousin Homer, how are you?

13:53.822 --> 13:55.449
And this must be Bart and Lisa.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.192
Well, aren't you nice-looking kids.

13:57.275 --> 13:59.498
Hey, do you folks want to see a quilt

13:59.537 --> 14:02.041
that's been in our family 
for five generations?

14:02.176 --> 14:04.305
I warned you he was an idiot.

14:04.918 --> 14:08.606
Well, all I need is some 
moonshine and someone playing

14:08.618 --> 14:12.090
the harmonicky and I'm as 
happy as a pig in plop.

14:12.442 --> 14:14.283
We're having lasagna and caesar salad.

14:14.915 --> 14:16.076
Don't laugh.

14:16.096 --> 14:18.340
They're doing the best they can.

14:20.450 --> 14:21.722
So, Homer, how are you?

14:21.885 --> 14:22.831
Oh, just great.

14:22.859 --> 14:23.881
Things couldn't be better.

14:25.356 --> 14:27.588
And how is our lovely Marge?

14:28.739 --> 14:32.593
She, was killed by a 
falling air conditioner.

14:32.812 --> 14:34.614
But that's terrible!

14:34.909 --> 14:36.547
It wasn't all bad.

14:36.791 --> 14:39.430
As part of the settlement, her 
funeral was air conditioned.

14:42.739 --> 14:45.175
Now if you'll excuse me, I have 
to use the outhouse again.

14:45.861 --> 14:47.545
Well, we don't have an outhouse.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.493
My recording studio!

14:51.402 --> 14:54.115
So how are we related again?

14:54.177 --> 14:55.603
Our dogs are brothers.

14:56.111 --> 14:57.134
Oh, yeah.

14:58.787 --> 14:59.938
I see mom!

15:01.948 --> 15:04.459
I've got my groove back!

15:04.581 --> 15:05.962
We've got to tell dad!

15:06.148 --> 15:06.814
Where is he?

15:11.694 --> 15:14.328
You lost that first game to hustle me!

15:18.969 --> 15:22.274
I can't believe how many 
manatees we saved today.

15:22.501 --> 15:24.630
And the ones we can't save, 
we put to good use.

15:33.043 --> 15:34.778
what am I supposed to do, 
bury them at arlington?

15:36.750 --> 15:37.661
Marge?

15:37.681 --> 15:38.506
Homer?

15:38.601 --> 15:39.959
These are for you.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.273
Listen, I thought about what I did.

15:43.386 --> 15:45.544
And it was really, really wrong.

15:46.284 --> 15:47.493
I'm sorry.

15:47.833 --> 15:50.573
Homie, I accept your apology.

15:51.456 --> 15:52.755
I love you, Marge.

15:53.104 --> 15:54.725
But I'm not coming back yet.

15:55.568 --> 15:57.627
I've found a place where I'm needed.

15:57.699 --> 15:58.987
You're needed at home!

15:59.023 --> 16:00.916
And treated like I deserve.

16:02.502 --> 16:03.709
You're needed at home!

16:03.822 --> 16:04.932
I'm sorry, Homie.

16:05.086 --> 16:08.119
I just can't find it in my 
heart to come back right now.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.286
Well, that's very reasonable.

16:10.304 --> 16:11.512
You stole my wife!

16:11.525 --> 16:12.498
I'll kill you!

16:12.653 --> 16:15.296
Homer, I have no interest 
in stealing your wife,

16:15.330 --> 16:17.982
but Marge is getting something 
from her work with me.

16:17.969 --> 16:20.711
Something a strong, passionate 
woman like her needs:

16:21.205 --> 16:21.904
A purpose.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.647
I can see why she loves you.

16:25.696 --> 16:26.872
She doesn't love me.

16:26.905 --> 16:28.450
She's just trying to find herself.

16:28.619 --> 16:30.580
You know everything.

16:30.691 --> 16:31.800
I don't know everything.

16:31.862 --> 16:32.750
I'm just a man.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.744
And what a man!

16:38.186 --> 16:40.315
Okay, the key to this thing 
is the manatees.

16:40.358 --> 16:42.050
Is marge saving them or killing them?

16:42.084 --> 16:42.778
Saving!

16:42.863 --> 16:44.096
Okay. To save the manatees,

16:44.133 --> 16:46.464
I guess I could donate 
my time and money

16:46.477 --> 16:47.691
and help build them a...

16:48.042 --> 16:49.181
Screw that.

16:50.053 --> 16:50.532
Dad!

16:50.684 --> 16:52.733
Those jet skiers are headed 
right for a herd of manatees!

16:56.068 --> 16:58.559
Check out those gentle, 
exotic sea creatures.

16:58.596 --> 16:59.832
Let's whomp 'em!

17:06.246 --> 17:07.307
Man, I just wish

17:07.332 --> 17:08.618
we could see their tears.

17:11.223 --> 17:13.035
why don't you pick on 
someone your own size?

17:13.097 --> 17:14.651
They are roughly our size.

17:14.769 --> 17:16.494
In fact, they're bigger than us.

17:16.565 --> 17:19.673
Look, if it were up to me, 
I'd be harassing them with you.

17:19.710 --> 17:21.867
If anything, I'd be the 
guy who took it too far.

17:21.907 --> 17:24.369
But I love my wife and 
I want to win her back!

17:24.621 --> 17:25.580
You're a brave man.

17:25.853 --> 17:27.161
And we respect two things:

17:27.455 --> 17:30.539
Bravery and tattoos that 
look like barbed wire.

17:30.638 --> 17:31.320
Let's go.

17:35.965 --> 17:36.557
Rubes!

17:38.312 --> 17:40.285
What did you call us?

17:40.317 --> 17:41.425
Catch me if you can!

17:53.612 --> 17:54.910
Manatees-- defend!

18:12.196 --> 18:13.947
Attention jet skiers.

18:14.072 --> 18:18.623
I have a court order here requiring
you to vacate these waters.

18:18.734 --> 18:21.238
No court order's gonna tell me what to do.

18:21.415 --> 18:22.430
Oh, man--

18:22.462 --> 18:23.531
it's notarized!

18:23.691 --> 18:24.677
Let's boogie!

18:27.606 --> 18:28.975
Homer, are you okay?

18:29.148 --> 18:30.393
How many fingers am I holding up?

18:30.605 --> 18:33.072
Poor dumb country mouse.

18:33.298 --> 18:34.704
Can't even count.

18:37.356 --> 18:38.256
My sweet,

18:38.281 --> 18:39.156
sweet Homie!

18:39.171 --> 18:42.363
You sacrificed yourself for the manatees.

18:43.526 --> 18:44.772
Rubes...

18:44.803 --> 18:46.776
so many rubeS...

18:46.840 --> 18:48.861
pounding me with their jet skis...

18:49.324 --> 18:50.286
rubes.

18:50.371 --> 18:52.616
Please, no, rubes.

18:59.546 --> 19:02.042
I'm gonna take you home and fix you up,

19:02.050 --> 19:04.845
'cause you're the real endangered species--

19:05.043 --> 19:06.893
a devoted husband.

19:10.472 --> 19:13.775
Marge, I'm always amazed you chose me.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.400
And I always will.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.636
I'm starting to think I should find a woman.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.754
Yeah, miranda was nice, but I'm not driving

19:27.766 --> 19:30.148
to corpus christi every time 
she needs a light bulb changed.

19:30.975 --> 19:31.567
Amen.

19:31.683 --> 19:34.803
Hey, since we got the kids 
with us, why don't we all take

19:34.902 --> 19:37.294
a few days of much-needed r and r?

19:37.302 --> 19:39.029
Don't you have to be back at work?

19:39.113 --> 19:39.607
Yes.

19:39.785 --> 19:42.655
But I've got a friend who 
owes me a solid.

19:45.936 --> 19:48.945
Smithers, who is this barrel-chested go-getter?

19:51.205 --> 19:54.191
I believe it's a manatee 
posing as homer simpson, sir.

19:55.608 --> 19:56.989
Oh, that's cute.

19:57.024 --> 19:59.228
I think this is the beginning 
of a beautiful friendship.

19:59.432 --> 20:02.223
Actually, sir, I believe he's 
about to die of dehydration.

20:02.455 --> 20:03.106
Good heavens!

20:03.279 --> 20:04.860
Grab a sponge, man!

20:09.614 --> 20:12.108
You might not ever get rich

20:13.178 --> 20:14.394
but let me tell ya, it's

20:14.385 --> 20:15.889
better than diggin' a ditch

20:17.459 --> 20:19.279
there ain't no tellin'

20:19.308 --> 20:20.833
who you might meet

20:20.854 --> 20:23.104
a movie star or maybe

20:23.780 --> 20:24.900
even an indian chief

20:24.936 --> 20:26.827
workin' at the car wash....

20:29.956 --> 20:30.681
...car wash

20:31.305 --> 20:37.180
