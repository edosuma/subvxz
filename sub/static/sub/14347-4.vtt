WEBVTT

00:03.568 --> 00:04.633
Oh. You got a letter

00:04.668 --> 00:06.401
from the Bureau
of Investigations and Trials.

00:06.436 --> 00:08.885
Probably a ruling
in that case of yours.

00:08.920 --> 00:11.334
Thought you might be interested.
Funny, huh?

00:14.234 --> 00:15.499
These assholes.

00:15.534 --> 00:17.284
They want to suspend me
for 60 days

00:17.319 --> 00:18.793
and give me
a seven-day vacation rip?

00:18.828 --> 00:20.267
There's no way
I'm accepting this.

00:20.302 --> 00:21.665
You're a retard if you don't.

00:21.700 --> 00:23.765
How did they come
to this decision so quick?

00:23.800 --> 00:26.000
I mean, they just hooked me
up on charges last week.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.581
You're telling me they've spoken
to everybody involved already?

00:28.634 --> 00:30.867
Send it in and be happy
they're letting you slide.

00:30.902 --> 00:33.401
Letting me slide.
They're crucifying me.

00:33.436 --> 00:34.967
This is political bullshit, Ron.

00:35.002 --> 00:36.232
Eat it, Jerry.

00:36.267 --> 00:39.167
The department doesn't want
any more bad press.

00:39.202 --> 00:40.698
Consider that a gift.

00:40.733 --> 00:42.250
You know, this happens
any other time,

00:42.285 --> 00:43.767
your head would be
on a chopping block.

00:43.802 --> 00:45.533
Oh, it's a gift.

00:45.568 --> 00:47.000
What about my rights
to a hearing?

00:47.035 --> 00:49.266
You don't want a hearing.

00:49.301 --> 00:51.301
They bring this guy Teff
into court in a wheelchair,

00:51.336 --> 00:52.599
you won't have a chance.

00:52.634 --> 00:55.067
I'm not gonna let him
make an example out of me.

00:55.102 --> 00:56.032
Let him!

00:56.067 --> 00:58.166
Jesus, Jerry.

00:58.201 --> 01:00.434
Use the little bean God gave you
on this one.

01:00.469 --> 01:02.232
You make a stink here,

01:02.267 --> 01:04.700
you could be out of a job
and a pension.

01:12.034 --> 01:12.999
Hey.

01:13.034 --> 01:14.099
Hey, what's up?

01:14.134 --> 01:15.450
Hey, remember that blonde
we met

01:15.485 --> 01:16.767
at the Bubble Bar
last month,

01:16.802 --> 01:17.767
you were with me, right?

01:17.802 --> 01:18.732
Yeah, yeah.

01:18.767 --> 01:20.099
The one you banged
that night?

01:20.128 --> 01:22.740
Actually, I've been banging her
ever since, but I don't know her name.

01:22.767 --> 01:25.599
Damn.
How you pulling that off?

01:25.642 --> 01:28.322
Well, it's like a late-night booty call.
Not a lot of conversation.

01:28.370 --> 01:29.566
Yeah, those are the best.

01:29.601 --> 01:31.800
Well, I got to come up
with a name soon, man.

01:31.835 --> 01:33.798
Yeah.

01:33.833 --> 01:35.266
You know what?
You could do that thing

01:35.301 --> 01:36.665
where you introduce her
to somebody.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.501
You say the other person's name
but not hers,

01:38.536 --> 01:40.100
and then she has to say,
"Hi, I'm..."

01:40.135 --> 01:41.117
Fill in the blank.

01:41.152 --> 01:42.100
Never going to work.

01:42.135 --> 01:43.299
Why not?

01:43.334 --> 01:45.134
'Cause I don't take this
chick out in public.

01:45.178 --> 01:47.397
- Oh, yeah.
- See?

01:47.494 --> 01:49.761
Yeah. You got yourself
a real goddamn dilemma there.

01:49.848 --> 01:51.430
Yeah. Broads.

01:51.488 --> 01:53.534
It's not enough that
you're banging them like crazy,

01:53.572 --> 01:55.000
now you got
to know their names.

01:55.034 --> 01:56.401
Yeah. Chicks. Very demanding.

01:56.436 --> 01:57.900
- Later.
- Later.

02:00.967 --> 02:01.900
Excuse me?

02:03.234 --> 02:04.334
Hey, can I help you?

02:04.369 --> 02:05.334
I don't know.

02:05.369 --> 02:06.568
Can you?

02:07.900 --> 02:09.499
I'm Nez.

02:09.533 --> 02:12.067
Um, Sean... Garrity.

02:12.102 --> 02:13.134
I work here.

02:13.169 --> 02:14.132
Obviously.

02:14.167 --> 02:15.900
Kind of figured that out.

02:17.534 --> 02:19.601
Is Franco here?

02:19.636 --> 02:21.168
Boy, I'm not sure.

02:21.203 --> 02:22.451
I could check, though.

02:22.486 --> 02:23.700
What was the name again?

02:23.735 --> 02:24.767
Nez.

02:25.668 --> 02:27.267
Think you can
remember that?

02:27.302 --> 02:28.517
Yeah, yeah.

02:28.552 --> 02:29.698
Sure, Nez.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.501
I'll be right back.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:42.367 --> 02:43.367
Hey, Franco.

02:43.402 --> 02:44.332
What's up, man?

02:44.367 --> 02:46.800
Some chick named Nez
here to see you?

02:46.835 --> 02:47.867
- Nez?
- Yeah.

02:47.902 --> 02:48.865
Are you sure?

02:48.900 --> 02:50.000
Yeah. Why?
Who is she?

02:50.035 --> 02:51.065
Ex-girlfriend.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.700
The greatest piece of ass
I ever had.

02:52.735 --> 02:54.301
In bed, she's in
the Hall of Fame.

02:54.336 --> 02:55.851
Out of bed, she's a nightmare.

02:55.886 --> 02:57.367
She's nuts, you know?
Loco.

02:57.402 --> 02:58.584
She stabbed me once.

02:58.619 --> 02:59.767
Technically, twice.

02:59.802 --> 03:00.865
Technically?

03:00.900 --> 03:02.501
Yeah. The second time
was with a pencil.

03:02.536 --> 03:03.466
Didn't break the skin.

03:03.501 --> 03:04.951
I couldn't really press charges

03:04.986 --> 03:06.366
without looking
like a pussy.

03:06.401 --> 03:08.401
One time, she beat
the living shit out of me.

03:08.436 --> 03:10.185
Oh, come on.
She's a chick, bro.

03:10.220 --> 03:11.727
Not when she's high,
she ain't.

03:11.762 --> 03:13.648
Touch of tequila,
dollop of blow,

03:13.683 --> 03:15.534
she's the Jolly Green
goddamn Giant.

03:15.569 --> 03:16.499
Shit.

03:16.534 --> 03:19.133
Well, what do you
want me to tell her?

03:19.168 --> 03:21.701
You know what?
Tell her I'm not here.

03:21.736 --> 03:24.234
Better yet, tell her
I died in a fire.

03:24.269 --> 03:25.566
Hey, I'm serious, man.

03:25.601 --> 03:26.732
Frank, I'm a terrible liar.

03:26.767 --> 03:29.150
Yeah, well, look,
to stay clear of this chick,

03:29.180 --> 03:32.693
I promise I'll die in a fire real soon,
okay? That way, you're not really lying.

03:32.768 --> 03:35.267
Please, Sean.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.767
All right.

03:37.802 --> 03:38.800
Shit.

03:40.568 --> 03:41.566
Find him?

03:41.601 --> 03:44.934
Uh, listen, uh,
I was off last night,

03:44.969 --> 03:47.132
so I just found out.

03:47.167 --> 03:51.800
I can't believe this,
but, uh, Franco--

03:51.835 --> 03:53.584
He died in a fire.

03:53.619 --> 03:55.334
Frankie's dead?

03:55.369 --> 03:56.865
Yeah.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.467
Pretty much.

03:58.502 --> 03:59.999
Well, totally.

04:00.034 --> 04:01.599
It was a fifth alarm,

04:01.634 --> 04:03.668
and he ran back in
to save an old lady,

04:03.703 --> 04:05.367
and he never made it back out.

04:06.767 --> 04:08.783
Excuse me.

04:08.818 --> 04:10.800
Mentiroso.

04:10.835 --> 04:12.566
What?

04:12.601 --> 04:14.267
I called you a liar.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.800
Do you have a pen?

04:17.834 --> 04:19.065
Some paper?

04:19.100 --> 04:20.867
No. I-- I don't.

04:23.334 --> 04:24.817
Nice.

04:24.852 --> 04:26.176
Work out?

04:26.211 --> 04:27.466
Not really.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.798
My membership at Bally's
ran out.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.634
They wanted me to join
for, like, three years--

04:30.669 --> 04:32.266
- That's my number.
- Okay.

04:32.301 --> 04:33.934
Tell your dead friend
to call me...

04:33.969 --> 04:36.534
or you can call me
yourself.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.831
DNA

05:46.668 --> 05:49.167
Ahh.

05:53.833 --> 05:55.234
Ahh.

06:04.334 --> 06:05.366
Yeah?

06:05.401 --> 06:06.765
Where are you?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.833
Oh, hey. I'm on my way.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.832
How far are you?

06:10.867 --> 06:13.166
Uh, like five minutes.

06:13.201 --> 06:15.150
I looked outside
a few seconds ago,

06:15.185 --> 06:17.100
and I thought I saw
your truck.

06:17.135 --> 06:18.801
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.151
I'm still driving.

06:20.186 --> 06:21.467
As a matter of fact--

06:21.831 --> 06:23.628
Watch where you're
going, asshole!

06:23.669 --> 06:24.832
Jerk!

06:24.867 --> 06:26.668
I'll be there
in a couple of minutes, hon.

06:26.703 --> 06:28.733
All right?

06:28.768 --> 06:31.734
Bye.

06:31.769 --> 06:34.700
Oh, God.

06:40.301 --> 06:41.301
Hey.

06:41.336 --> 06:42.266
Hey.

06:42.301 --> 06:43.900
What's going on?

06:43.935 --> 06:45.734
Mm.

06:45.769 --> 06:47.534
Mm.

06:49.134 --> 06:51.167
Mm...

06:53.367 --> 06:55.434
I missed you
the last two nights.

06:55.469 --> 06:56.968
Guess so.

06:57.003 --> 06:58.432
Yeah.

06:58.467 --> 07:00.833
I'm gonna jump in the shower.

07:00.868 --> 07:01.965
Okay.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.201
If you'd like a drink,
help yourself.

07:04.236 --> 07:07.665
Okay.
Hurry up.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.501
Listen, I don't want to get
in between anything

07:09.536 --> 07:12.301
that you and Franco
got going on, so...

07:12.336 --> 07:15.134
There's nothing to
get in between.

07:15.169 --> 07:17.000
He's dead, right?

07:18.167 --> 07:19.767
I'm usually
not that kind of guy.

07:19.802 --> 07:20.899
You know, the lying kind.

07:20.934 --> 07:22.434
I was put
in an awkward situation.

07:22.469 --> 07:24.067
Don't sweat it.

07:26.867 --> 07:30.134
I feel like I'm doing
something wrong.

07:32.534 --> 07:33.733
What's wrong with
having a drink

07:33.768 --> 07:37.718
with a new friend?

07:37.753 --> 07:41.668
Nothing, I guess.

07:41.703 --> 07:43.798
Relax.

07:43.833 --> 07:46.366
Hey, asshole!

07:46.401 --> 07:48.800
Get me another Jack
on the rocks!

07:48.835 --> 07:51.401
A double!

08:05.034 --> 08:08.267
Lauren.

08:08.302 --> 08:11.401
Nancy.

08:11.436 --> 08:13.518
Lauren.

08:13.553 --> 08:15.601
Nancy.

08:22.993 --> 08:26.140
- Maybe she's got a roommate.
- She never mentioned a roommate,

08:26.202 --> 08:27.132
and I never seen one.

08:27.167 --> 08:28.617
Maybe it's just mail
from a chick

08:28.652 --> 08:29.959
that used to
live here, you know?

08:29.994 --> 08:31.447
Yeah. You know,
that's possible.

08:31.482 --> 08:32.865
So it's Nancy
or Lauren, huh?

08:32.900 --> 08:35.534
She didn't look like a Nancy
to me. I'd go with Lauren.

08:35.568 --> 08:37.534
I kind of secretly was hoping
she was a Nancy.

08:37.568 --> 08:38.499
Why is that?

08:38.534 --> 08:40.133
'Cause Nancys give better head.

08:40.168 --> 08:41.698
Oh, you've researched
that?

08:41.732 --> 08:44.065
Basing it on the two
Nancys that I've known.

08:44.100 --> 08:46.401
Oh, yeah. So have you
been with a Lauren?

08:46.436 --> 08:47.999
- One.
- Yeah, and the head was, uh...

08:48.034 --> 08:49.867
Look, there's no such thing
as bad head.

08:49.902 --> 08:51.700
It was just, you know,
a matter of degrees.

08:51.735 --> 08:53.199
Yeah. Agreed.

08:53.234 --> 08:54.833
Girls, what are your names?

08:54.892 --> 08:56.698
- Heather.
- Brittany.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.149
What about Heather
and Brittany?

08:58.201 --> 09:00.184
Where do those two names
fall on the chart?

09:00.219 --> 09:02.167
Heather and Brittany?
I'd say, top three.

09:02.202 --> 09:03.201
Oh, yeah.
It's my night.

09:04.201 --> 09:05.765
I got to go.
I got another call.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.798
Yeah. Hey, bro.
Hang in there, all right?

09:07.833 --> 09:10.034
Until you get more evidence,
just, you know, keep it simple.

09:10.069 --> 09:11.065
Baby. Sweetheart.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.833
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:15.334 --> 09:16.299
Hello?

09:16.334 --> 09:17.800
Dad, it's me.
There's a--

09:17.835 --> 09:18.765
No.

09:18.800 --> 09:19.800
But you don't even know--

09:19.835 --> 09:20.899
No.

09:20.934 --> 09:22.650
- Can I just tell you--?
- No, no, no, no.

09:22.685 --> 09:24.332
If it's a place,
you're not going.

09:24.367 --> 09:25.932
If it's a thing,
you're not getting it.

09:25.967 --> 09:27.934
If it's an animal, vegetable,
mineral, absolutely not.

09:27.971 --> 09:30.383
Actually, vegetables are good for you,
so take that off the list.

09:30.467 --> 09:32.867
It's a Matchbox 20
concert in the city.

09:32.902 --> 09:34.034
You're kidding me,
right?

09:34.069 --> 09:34.999
Let me guess.

09:35.034 --> 09:36.367
The Murphy kid's
driving, right?

09:36.402 --> 09:37.718
So what?

09:37.753 --> 09:39.034
Bye-bye.

09:40.034 --> 09:40.999
Ah!

09:41.034 --> 09:42.999
He's such a jerk.

09:43.034 --> 09:44.900
Did he say something
about me?

09:44.935 --> 09:46.698
No.

09:46.733 --> 09:50.900
So you can't go
to the concert.

10:05.700 --> 10:09.467
Dick around with me, huh?
You pencil-pushing bastards.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.965
Ow. Ow.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.765
You like that,
baby?

10:18.800 --> 10:21.568
It's a little tight,
but it's nice.

10:23.568 --> 10:25.832
Ooh! Okay.

10:25.867 --> 10:28.032
Don't go anywhere.

10:28.067 --> 10:29.668
Yeah, that's not going
to be a problem.

10:29.703 --> 10:31.501
Ohh!

10:34.700 --> 10:37.201
Hey, Nez,
what are you doing?

10:37.236 --> 10:40.001
Getting ready, baby!

10:40.036 --> 10:42.767
Here comes Mama!

10:45.800 --> 10:47.466
Oh, Jesus!

10:47.501 --> 10:50.065
Who is it?

10:50.100 --> 10:53.166
Hey, dude. It's Andrew.
Andy.

10:53.201 --> 10:54.501
I was just
in the neighborhood.

10:54.536 --> 10:55.832
I was just walking by.

10:55.867 --> 10:58.134
I thought maybe we
could have a drink.

10:58.169 --> 10:59.166
Who's that?

10:59.201 --> 11:00.634
A friend of mine.

11:00.669 --> 11:02.566
Go to bed.

11:02.601 --> 11:03.899
I'll be right down.

11:03.934 --> 11:06.434
- Asì, asì, ah!
- Oh, yeah.

11:10.568 --> 11:11.601
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

11:13.267 --> 11:15.234
Ow! Jesus.

11:22.234 --> 11:24.267
What are you doing?

11:24.302 --> 11:26.232
Aah!

11:26.267 --> 11:27.534
Holy shit!

11:31.501 --> 11:34.100
Hey, it's a little late
to be buzzing me, bro.

11:34.135 --> 11:35.798
Sorry. Um, I was
in the neighborhood.

11:35.833 --> 11:37.833
I thought I could get you
a drink or something.

11:37.868 --> 11:40.201
I mean, I haven't seen you
in two weeks.

11:40.236 --> 11:41.701
I thought we'd hook up.

11:41.736 --> 11:43.167
Yeah.
I've been real busy.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.299
Okay.

11:44.334 --> 11:46.534
Um, well, what about
tomorrow night maybe?

11:46.569 --> 11:48.085
I work until 9.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.566
That's perfect.

11:49.601 --> 11:51.733
I know a great little bar
in this neighborhood.

11:51.768 --> 11:54.800
Yeah, well...
I don't know.

11:54.835 --> 11:57.833
Did I do something wrong?

11:57.868 --> 11:59.399
No.

11:59.434 --> 12:01.267
I mean, because I'm
getting, like, this...

12:01.294 --> 12:04.582
This negative energy from you,
like I'm being a nuisance or something.

12:04.636 --> 12:05.732
No.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.467
I mean, all I'm trying
to do is just--

12:07.502 --> 12:09.167
I just want to show
you my gratitude

12:09.202 --> 12:10.499
for saving my life.

12:10.534 --> 12:11.867
Damn it! I did it again!

12:11.902 --> 12:13.201
- Hey!
- I did it again.

12:13.236 --> 12:14.399
It's okay.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.201
- I don't believe it.
- Andrew. It's okay.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.668
No, it's not okay.

12:17.703 --> 12:19.768
I just...

12:19.803 --> 12:21.798
Look...

12:21.833 --> 12:24.934
My therapist has told me
that I drive people away

12:24.969 --> 12:27.367
because I have this
fear of intimacy,

12:27.402 --> 12:29.000
and I... just--

12:29.035 --> 12:29.965
Damn it!

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Asshole! Asshole!
Aah!

12:31.035 --> 12:32.899
Okay, okay, fine.

12:32.934 --> 12:34.334
Tomorrow night
we'll have a drink.

12:34.369 --> 12:35.584
You sure?

12:35.619 --> 12:36.743
Yeah, yeah.

12:36.778 --> 12:37.867
I can't wait.

12:41.367 --> 12:42.934
Cool, man. Cool, man.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.434
Oh, that's nice.

12:55.469 --> 12:56.499
Oh, yeah.

12:56.534 --> 12:57.700
You like that, baby?

12:57.735 --> 12:59.299
Ohh!

12:59.334 --> 13:02.301
Oh, that feels good, baby.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.299
Turn around.

13:08.334 --> 13:10.201
Turn around, baby.

13:10.236 --> 13:11.800
Face me.

13:20.568 --> 13:21.798
I love you, baby.

13:21.833 --> 13:24.333
I love you, too, baby.

13:24.368 --> 13:26.833
I knew you loved me!

13:26.868 --> 13:28.201
I could tell.

13:34.201 --> 13:35.800
What time are you
going to be back?

13:35.835 --> 13:37.166
I should be back about 5.

13:37.201 --> 13:39.000
Oh, and make sure that Connor
eats his vegetables.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.367
Hey, where you going?

13:40.402 --> 13:41.668
Just to do
some errands.

13:41.703 --> 13:42.899
Colleen needs some shoes.

13:42.934 --> 13:44.266
Yeah, she doesn't have
enough shoes.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.334
Well, apparently, these shoes
she can't live without,

13:46.369 --> 13:47.885
so, what are you gonna do?

13:47.920 --> 13:50.093
I don't know. Try saying no?

13:50.128 --> 13:52.232
Oh, that's great, Tom. Thanks.

13:52.267 --> 13:54.932
All I'm saying is,
I'm doing my job.

13:54.967 --> 13:56.767
You might pay a little more
attention to yours.

13:56.802 --> 13:58.499
Excuse me?

13:58.534 --> 14:00.534
You know, every other night
I see you going out.

14:00.569 --> 14:01.798
I don't know
where you're going.

14:01.833 --> 14:03.916
Dinner, movies, whatever.
Having a grand old time.

14:03.951 --> 14:06.000
Meanwhile, she's running around
with the Murphy kid,

14:06.035 --> 14:08.367
she's got a tattoo on her, uh...
area.

14:08.402 --> 14:10.401
Okay. Colleen, get in the car.

14:13.067 --> 14:14.267
You know what I'm saying?

14:14.302 --> 14:15.432
I tell you what, Tom.

14:15.467 --> 14:17.232
Why don't I move
the three kids over there,

14:17.267 --> 14:19.467
and you see what kind
of parenting you do by yourself.

14:19.502 --> 14:21.134
I couldn't do any worse.

14:22.234 --> 14:24.665
Priorities!

14:24.700 --> 14:27.234
Sounds like this guy's
got a savior complex.

14:27.269 --> 14:28.199
What's that?

14:28.234 --> 14:29.234
Well, you saved
his life.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.435
He feels indebted
to you.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.566
It happens to all of us.

14:31.601 --> 14:33.568
One time,
I saved this old broad.

14:33.603 --> 14:35.765
She just had to thank me.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.634
So get this, she puts me
in her will.

14:37.669 --> 14:40.034
Wow.
What happened?

14:40.069 --> 14:41.099
Nothing.

14:41.134 --> 14:43.166
Waiting for her to die.

14:43.201 --> 14:44.467
You think this guy's violent?

14:44.502 --> 14:46.065
No, but...

14:46.100 --> 14:47.633
He might want to,
you know...

14:47.668 --> 14:49.467
I think he's interested
in me in that way.

14:49.502 --> 14:50.432
I see.

14:50.467 --> 14:52.533
Well, you got two choices.

14:52.568 --> 14:54.367
One is you be honest
and you tell him

14:54.402 --> 14:55.568
you don't play
on that team.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.032
Or?

14:57.067 --> 14:59.434
Or go back to his apartment,
you set it on fire,

14:59.469 --> 15:01.301
and this time,
you let him burn.

15:01.336 --> 15:02.332
Hey, man.

15:02.367 --> 15:03.366
Where were you
last night?

15:03.401 --> 15:04.800
I called you twice
from the Hudson

15:04.835 --> 15:06.299
looking for a wingman.

15:06.334 --> 15:08.134
I had twins hanging
all over my jock, Sean.

15:08.169 --> 15:09.099
Twins.

15:09.134 --> 15:10.932
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:10.967 --> 15:12.967
I just fell asleep at home
watching some reality show.

15:13.002 --> 15:14.366
Oh, yeah.
I hate those things.

15:14.401 --> 15:15.965
I mean, how many times
in your life

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
has somebody offered you
50 grand to eat horse rectum?

15:18.035 --> 15:19.132
Shit.

15:19.167 --> 15:20.367
Maybe that's
somebody's reality.

15:20.402 --> 15:22.299
It sure as hell
ain't mine.

15:22.334 --> 15:24.884
Damn, papi,
what happened to your neck?

15:24.919 --> 15:27.399
Oh, I was watching
my neighbor's cat.

15:27.434 --> 15:29.833
You're allergic to cats, Sean.
Man, you are a bad liar.

15:30.967 --> 15:32.366
What, you, uh, you get

15:32.401 --> 15:33.867
a little something-something
last night?

15:33.902 --> 15:35.798
Yeah.

15:35.833 --> 15:37.267
- Yeah?
- I did.

15:37.302 --> 15:38.332
Okay.

15:38.367 --> 15:39.900
So... what? What?
Give me the details.

15:39.949 --> 15:42.092
What, some crazy little pussy
claw you up?

15:42.131 --> 15:44.965
- What was her name ?
- Hi, Frankie.

15:45.401 --> 15:46.467
Dead man walking, huh?

15:48.067 --> 15:49.499
Guess you heard I was in town

15:49.534 --> 15:51.634
and rose from the grave
just for me.

15:52.833 --> 15:54.067
Hi, Sean.

15:54.102 --> 15:55.733
Hey.

15:57.501 --> 15:59.533
- Come here.
- Cut it out.

15:59.568 --> 16:01.733
I told you to never
come to my job.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.232
Cut it out!

16:04.267 --> 16:05.698
What do you want?

16:05.733 --> 16:07.132
- I just want to talk.
- Yeah?

16:07.167 --> 16:09.367
Well, seeing as how we don't
have anything to talk about,

16:09.409 --> 16:11.731
I can only categorize that activity
as a complete waste of time.

16:11.767 --> 16:13.568
Actually, we have quite a lot
to talk about.

16:13.603 --> 16:14.732
Hey, you just keep in mind,

16:14.767 --> 16:16.367
if you've got a weapon,
I got witnesses.

16:16.402 --> 16:17.832
I didn't come here to fight.

16:17.867 --> 16:20.067
Nothing's ever going to happen
between us again, Nez.

16:20.102 --> 16:21.166
It's been five years.

16:21.201 --> 16:23.000
I mean, you know,
you got to know that.

16:23.035 --> 16:24.900
Things are different now,
Frankie.

16:24.935 --> 16:26.166
I'm clean.

16:26.201 --> 16:28.166
Nez, I'm really not in the mood
for your bullshit.

16:28.201 --> 16:31.467
Please, just say what you want
to say and get out of here.

16:31.502 --> 16:33.034
Remember Lazara?

16:33.069 --> 16:35.051
Yeah. Hey.

16:35.086 --> 16:36.810
Hey, Frank.

16:36.845 --> 16:38.256
And this...

16:38.291 --> 16:39.633
is Keela.

16:39.668 --> 16:41.784
She's real cute.

16:41.819 --> 16:43.900
Glad you think so.

16:43.935 --> 16:44.833
She's yours.

16:47.301 --> 16:48.332
Okay.

16:48.367 --> 16:50.100
Frankie, you can't
walk away from this.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.065
Yeah? Watch me.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.932
You have a responsibility.

16:52.967 --> 16:54.367
No, I don't.
That's not my kid.

16:54.402 --> 16:55.698
She's yours.

16:55.733 --> 16:58.601
You thought you'd wait
five years to tell me?

16:58.636 --> 16:59.932
I always planned on coming back,

16:59.967 --> 17:02.167
but I knew you wouldn't see me
until I got better.

17:02.202 --> 17:03.332
I hate to tell you, sweetheart.

17:03.367 --> 17:04.800
You better give it
five more years.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.201
That's right.
Bring it on, bring it on, baby.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.401
That's the Nez I know.

17:11.733 --> 17:13.201
Why don't you go snort
some coke.

17:13.236 --> 17:14.300
Smoke some crack, okay?

17:18.067 --> 17:19.964
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.568
Mommy and Daddy
are just talking.

17:22.603 --> 17:24.268
That's Daddy.

17:24.303 --> 17:25.934
Say, "Hi, Daddy."

17:25.969 --> 17:26.898
Hi, Daddy.

17:26.934 --> 17:29.167
Wave to Daddy.
Hi, Daddy.

17:29.202 --> 17:30.566
Believe this shit?

17:30.601 --> 17:32.166
The bitch shows up
out of the blue

17:32.201 --> 17:34.000
and tells me I'm the father
of some kid?

17:34.040 --> 17:35.589
Shit, it's probably
not even hers.

17:38.016 --> 17:39.440
Well, what if you are?

17:39.469 --> 17:40.399
What?

17:40.434 --> 17:41.932
What if you are the father?

17:41.967 --> 17:43.433
- I'm not.
- But what if you were--

17:43.468 --> 17:44.900
You think
you're helping me here?

17:44.935 --> 17:45.899
I'm not the father.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.299
You want to be sure,
right, Frank?

17:47.334 --> 17:49.734
I mean, grab a piece
of the kid's hair or something.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.134
Get a DNA test done,
and then you'll know for sure.

17:52.169 --> 17:54.000
- I already know.
- You scared?

17:54.035 --> 17:55.268
Why you pushing me?

17:55.303 --> 17:56.466
I'm not pushing you.

17:56.501 --> 17:57.934
I don't need any
goddamn test, Sean.

17:57.969 --> 17:59.034
That is not my kid.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.055
It's an easy test.
It takes, like, two seconds.

18:01.100 --> 18:02.783
How is this any
of your business?

18:02.818 --> 18:04.467
I don't know.
I'm your friend, maybe?

18:04.502 --> 18:06.100
I want to see you
clear of this.

18:06.135 --> 18:07.334
Until you know for sure.

18:07.369 --> 18:08.332
Come on, Frank.

18:08.367 --> 18:10.668
What, you want peace
of mind or not? Frank!

18:12.434 --> 18:13.833
Things are getting worse.

18:13.868 --> 18:14.932
Yeah?

18:14.967 --> 18:16.932
You remember I told you--
Oh, thank you.

18:16.967 --> 18:19.267
I told you that I found 300
in Damian's drawer?

18:19.302 --> 18:20.432
Yeah?

18:20.467 --> 18:22.967
Where does a 15-year-old kid
get this kind of money?

18:23.002 --> 18:25.467
Two days ago, he bought
a brand-new leather jacket,

18:25.502 --> 18:27.551
and then last night,
get this,

18:27.586 --> 18:29.376
he comes home
with an iPod.

18:29.411 --> 18:31.167
Christ, he bought a car?

18:31.202 --> 18:32.499
No. It's not a car.

18:32.534 --> 18:35.301
It's like a music thing.

18:35.336 --> 18:36.366
Oh, an iPod.

18:36.401 --> 18:37.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah.

18:37.735 --> 18:39.000
This thing costs almost $500.

18:39.035 --> 18:40.132
Shit.

18:40.167 --> 18:42.167
This is a kid with no job.

18:42.202 --> 18:44.167
Did you even talk to him yet?

18:44.202 --> 18:45.701
No, not yet.

18:45.736 --> 18:47.166
Oh, Jesus.

18:47.201 --> 18:48.232
God rest his father's soul,

18:48.267 --> 18:49.867
but if Jimmy knew
what was going on,

18:49.902 --> 18:51.232
he would pop out of the grave

18:51.267 --> 18:53.067
and give his son
the beating of his life.

18:53.102 --> 18:54.800
Want some more wine?

18:54.835 --> 18:57.965
Hmm? Mm-hm.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.301
I'm sure there's a logical
explanation for this thing,

19:01.336 --> 19:02.599
you know?

19:02.634 --> 19:04.668
He's probably just, like,
tutoring after school

19:04.703 --> 19:06.534
with, like, you know...

19:06.569 --> 19:07.765
retards, you know?

19:07.800 --> 19:09.534
They have retarded kids
at that school, right?

19:09.569 --> 19:12.665
Mm-hm.

19:12.700 --> 19:15.366
You in a rush to go someplace?

19:15.401 --> 19:19.367
I'm sorry. It just, uh...
takes the edge off.

19:19.402 --> 19:21.099
I feel so guilty
drinking wine

19:21.134 --> 19:23.167
while you're sitting there
with a ginger ale.

19:23.202 --> 19:25.017
You miss booze?

19:25.052 --> 19:26.543
Nah. You kidding?

19:26.578 --> 19:28.034
Master of restraint.

19:28.069 --> 19:29.384
Really?

19:29.419 --> 19:30.665
Mm-hmm.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.299
Like a night like tonight

19:32.334 --> 19:35.467
with the dinner
and the candles and...

19:35.502 --> 19:36.765
a pretty girl?

19:36.800 --> 19:39.601
Well, maybe just a little bit.

19:45.733 --> 19:48.916
How's your day?
Save anyone's life?

19:48.951 --> 19:52.100
No. It doesn't happen
too often.

19:52.135 --> 19:53.967
Menus?

19:55.367 --> 19:56.800
Thank you.

19:56.835 --> 19:58.199
Look... ahem.

19:58.234 --> 20:00.932
Andrew, before we go
any further,

20:00.967 --> 20:02.967
I think there's something
you need to know about me.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.065
Okay.

20:04.100 --> 20:06.534
I'm just going to come
right out and say it.

20:10.367 --> 20:11.733
I'm not...

20:11.768 --> 20:12.934
a homo...

20:12.969 --> 20:14.065
sexual.

20:14.100 --> 20:16.568
Well, neither am I.

20:19.767 --> 20:20.767
Oh.

20:22.767 --> 20:25.232
Wonder what they have
on tap.

20:25.267 --> 20:29.167
I think about dating again,
and then reality sets in.

20:29.202 --> 20:31.668
I mean, what a personal ad
that would be, right?

20:33.201 --> 20:36.765
35, widow, with a teenage son.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.698
Enjoys cooking
and walking on the beach

20:39.733 --> 20:41.900
and sobbing uncontrollably
at the drop of a hat.

20:41.935 --> 20:43.000
No smokers.

20:44.601 --> 20:45.700
You know what?

20:46.800 --> 20:48.932
You are a catch.
You were always a catch,

20:48.967 --> 20:51.267
and I think you're hotter now
than you were before.

20:51.302 --> 20:52.232
You're full of shit.

20:52.267 --> 20:53.501
I'm serious.
You look great.

20:53.536 --> 20:55.000
- Okay.
- Here.

20:58.401 --> 21:00.967
Got it? All right.

21:01.002 --> 21:01.932
I'm not you.

21:01.967 --> 21:03.383
I'm a guy. I'm not a chick.

21:03.418 --> 21:04.765
I can't walk
in your shoes,

21:04.800 --> 21:08.267
but I'll tell you,
the thing with you and Lisa,

21:08.302 --> 21:09.401
that's nobody else's--

21:09.436 --> 21:10.700
What Lisa thing?

21:10.735 --> 21:12.951
You know...

21:12.986 --> 21:15.660
The thing.

21:15.695 --> 21:18.299
The thing?

21:18.334 --> 21:21.234
You know, the, uh...
The lesbian thing.

21:21.269 --> 21:22.698
What?!

21:22.733 --> 21:24.698
Look, I don't care. You know?

21:24.733 --> 21:26.334
It's your life.
You've got to be happy.

21:26.369 --> 21:28.468
That's the bottom line.

21:28.503 --> 21:30.685
Lisa is my psychic.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.867
That's--? That's all?

21:32.902 --> 21:34.965
Ohh.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.568
I'm sorry. I thought--

21:37.603 --> 21:39.052
I thought, uh...

21:39.087 --> 21:40.501
something else.

21:40.536 --> 21:41.518
Tommy!

21:41.553 --> 21:42.466
Shh!

21:42.501 --> 21:44.633
I would never,

21:44.668 --> 21:47.201
never be with another woman!

21:47.236 --> 21:48.865
Oh, my God!

21:48.900 --> 21:50.934
I mean, other than that one time
in high school.

21:50.969 --> 21:52.834
Really?

21:52.869 --> 21:54.700
Kidding.

21:54.735 --> 21:55.665
Oh.

21:55.700 --> 21:59.167
It was after high school.

22:05.501 --> 22:06.698
No.

22:06.733 --> 22:08.050
Very funny.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:08.085 --> 22:09.367
Had you thinking
about it.

22:09.402 --> 22:10.832
Oh, God!

22:10.867 --> 22:12.467
I cannot wait until
my fiancée gets here.

22:12.502 --> 22:13.668
I got to tell her this.

22:13.703 --> 22:15.099
Fiancée?

22:15.134 --> 22:16.750
Oh, man. I was way off.

22:16.785 --> 22:18.367
Mm-hmm. She's great too.

22:18.402 --> 22:19.584
Her name's Geneva.

22:19.619 --> 22:22.126
Oh, like the salami?

22:22.161 --> 22:24.599
Uh, no. That's "Genoa."

22:24.634 --> 22:27.167
Like-- Like the city.
Geneva.

22:27.202 --> 22:29.665
You are going to love her.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.867
And she's really going to be
into you too.

22:31.902 --> 22:33.034
You are totally her type.

22:33.069 --> 22:34.899
Cool.

22:34.934 --> 22:36.299
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

22:36.334 --> 22:37.367
Speaking of the devil.

22:37.402 --> 22:39.367
Hi, baby!

22:39.402 --> 22:40.868
Hi.

22:40.903 --> 22:42.334
Mmm!

22:46.700 --> 22:48.568
Mmm.
You smell good.

22:48.603 --> 22:49.765
Thank you.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.232
Geneva,
this is Mikey.

22:51.278 --> 22:54.110
- Mikey, this is my fiancée, Geneva.
- Oh, my God. You are my hero.

22:54.167 --> 22:58.234
Thank you so much
for what you did.

23:01.867 --> 23:03.934
As you can see,
she's very affectionate.

23:03.969 --> 23:05.032
She also believes

23:05.067 --> 23:07.383
in the "one good deed
deserves another" theory.

23:07.418 --> 23:09.700
The way I figure it,
we're getting married soon,

23:09.735 --> 23:11.732
and this may be
our last chance

23:11.767 --> 23:16.267
to really, you know,
let loose and, uh, do this.

23:16.302 --> 23:19.733
Do what?
What are you guys talking about?

23:19.768 --> 23:21.384
You didn't tell him?

23:21.419 --> 23:23.000
I was just about to.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.832
Dude...

23:24.867 --> 23:26.467
We want to have a three-way
with you.

23:26.502 --> 23:31.833
You mean like... sexually?

23:36.434 --> 23:39.566
Yep.

23:39.601 --> 23:41.132
There he is.

23:41.167 --> 23:43.717
Working away like
a busy little bee.

23:43.752 --> 23:46.267
Told you everything
was all right.

23:46.302 --> 23:49.401
I hope that you're right.

23:49.436 --> 23:50.718
This was fun.

23:50.753 --> 23:52.160
Our date.

23:52.195 --> 23:53.533
Yeah.

23:53.568 --> 23:56.765
Let's make it a thing.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.800
You want to make it
into a thing?

23:59.835 --> 24:02.800
Yeah, you know,
like a weekly thing.

24:02.835 --> 24:04.199
A weekly thing.

24:04.234 --> 24:07.501
Um...
What exactly--?

24:11.367 --> 24:14.367
Sheila...

24:24.934 --> 24:26.000
Call me.

24:27.434 --> 24:28.501
Okay. Be careful,
now.

24:28.536 --> 24:29.651
Be careful.

24:29.686 --> 24:30.767
You okay?

24:35.534 --> 24:37.167
Oh!

24:47.867 --> 24:51.000
Holy shit.

24:53.900 --> 24:56.167
Oh.

25:04.034 --> 25:04.999
Hello?

25:05.034 --> 25:06.633
Hey.
What are you doing

25:06.668 --> 25:08.065
spending that money
so quick?

25:08.100 --> 25:09.400
Didn't you ever see
Goodfellas?

25:09.435 --> 25:10.700
I heard it was
very violent.

25:10.735 --> 25:12.499
Very funny, very funny.

25:12.534 --> 25:14.134
I tell you what,
you're cut off, pally.

25:14.169 --> 25:15.201
Okay?
Not one more cent.

25:15.236 --> 25:16.452
Oh, that's too bad.

25:16.502 --> 25:19.071
Two little mouse clicks and
I can have Roger's car repossessed.

25:19.102 --> 25:20.432
Really?

25:20.467 --> 25:21.899
Take less than 24 hours.

25:21.934 --> 25:23.733
Hey, hey. By the way,
here's the plan, okay?

25:23.768 --> 25:25.266
You're going
to tell your mother

25:25.301 --> 25:28.501
you've been tutoring some
dumb kid at school, okay?

25:28.536 --> 25:30.401
That's the plan.
That's what you're doing now.

25:30.436 --> 25:31.534
Here she comes.

25:33.067 --> 25:34.501
- Hey, cutie.
- Hey.

25:34.536 --> 25:35.499
I'm home.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.534
How was dinner?

25:36.569 --> 25:37.765
Good.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.065
Who you talking to?

25:39.100 --> 25:41.983
Oh, this dyslexic kid
from my class at school.

25:42.018 --> 25:44.867
I've been tutoring him
the last couple of weeks,

25:44.902 --> 25:46.266
trying to make some money

25:46.301 --> 25:48.867
so I don't have
to take any from you.

25:48.902 --> 25:51.434
You're so sweet.
What's his name?

25:51.469 --> 25:53.199
Who?

25:53.234 --> 25:55.633
The dyslexic kid.

25:55.668 --> 25:59.967
Oh, it's, uh,
Jake something.

26:00.002 --> 26:03.534
You tell him I said hello.

26:03.569 --> 26:06.168
All right, Ma.
Will do.

26:06.203 --> 26:08.767
All right. She's gone.

26:08.802 --> 26:10.999
Nice.

26:11.034 --> 26:13.166
Hey, um...

26:13.201 --> 26:15.733
How much you think
the repossession would cost?

26:15.768 --> 26:18.000
Uh... five bills.

26:18.035 --> 26:18.965
All right.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.668
I'll get back to you.

26:21.867 --> 26:23.800
That kid's gonna put me
in the poorhouse.

26:26.634 --> 26:27.568
Jeez.

26:32.534 --> 26:35.100
Where the hell you been?

26:36.434 --> 26:37.633
We married now?

26:37.668 --> 26:40.100
Oh. Excuse me
for caring.

26:41.534 --> 26:42.599
By the way...

26:42.634 --> 26:45.000
the whole
Sheila-lesbian thing?

26:45.035 --> 26:46.000
False alarm.

26:46.035 --> 26:47.366
No.

26:47.401 --> 26:49.867
See, I told you she wouldn't be
into that, didn't I?

26:50.900 --> 26:52.334
I'm just worried about a guy.

26:52.369 --> 26:53.968
What do you mean?

26:54.003 --> 26:55.533
Is she seeing a guy?

26:55.568 --> 26:57.501
She's completely in
mourning over you.

26:57.536 --> 26:59.466
- Forget about it.
- Good.

26:59.501 --> 27:01.700
I mean, it's not good.
It's just, it's better than her

27:01.750 --> 27:04.162
seeing some other
asshole fireman, right?

27:04.201 --> 27:05.030
Yeah.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.833
What do you got, you got, uh...
something.

27:08.868 --> 27:09.832
What?

27:09.867 --> 27:11.100
What is that?

27:11.135 --> 27:12.299
It's red.

27:12.334 --> 27:14.366
Oh.
You know what that is?

27:14.401 --> 27:16.767
That's, um...
It's marinara sauce.

27:16.802 --> 27:17.732
I had, uh...

27:17.767 --> 27:20.467
I ate at Luigi's tonight.

27:24.167 --> 27:26.634
What was that?

27:26.669 --> 27:27.832
What?

27:27.867 --> 27:30.166
I don't know.
You just made a weird face.

27:30.201 --> 27:33.467
What are you talking about?
I didn't make a weird face.

27:33.502 --> 27:34.499
Yeah, you did.

27:34.534 --> 27:36.450
This is my normal
"come home,

27:36.485 --> 27:38.332
relax and have a drink"
face.

27:38.367 --> 27:40.533
Now it is, but two seconds ago
you made a weird,

27:40.568 --> 27:42.668
"Jimmy's talking about his wife
and I feel guilty" face.

27:42.703 --> 27:43.999
What are you, nuts?

27:44.034 --> 27:46.800
That was the "I have marinara
sauce on my face" face.

27:46.835 --> 27:48.884
I don't even have
the other guilty face thing

27:48.919 --> 27:51.160
you're talking about
in my face repertoire.

27:51.195 --> 27:53.401
The fact that you even have
a face repertoire

27:53.436 --> 27:54.798
makes you suspect.

27:54.833 --> 27:57.434
You know, it's like talking
to a broad, it really is.

27:57.469 --> 27:59.184
Okay?

27:59.219 --> 28:00.910
Blow me.

28:00.945 --> 28:02.601
Kiss my ass.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.266
Yeah?

28:06.301 --> 28:08.201
Mr. Rivera?
It's Dr. Verma.

28:08.236 --> 28:09.166
Oh, hey.

28:09.201 --> 28:10.765
The test was positive.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.967
It looks like you have
yourself a daughter.

28:14.002 --> 28:15.301
Oh. Um...

28:16.833 --> 28:19.599
Thank you. Thank you.

28:19.634 --> 28:21.501
It's that goddamn
West Side Highway again.

28:24.634 --> 28:25.732
So, what did you do?

28:25.767 --> 28:27.367
I excused myself,
went to the bathroom,

28:27.402 --> 28:28.967
and stayed there
for an hour and a half

28:29.002 --> 28:29.967
till they went home.

28:30.002 --> 28:30.965
Wait a minute.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
You passed
on a three-way?

28:32.035 --> 28:33.034
Was she hot?

28:33.069 --> 28:33.999
Way hot.

28:34.034 --> 28:35.332
Are you nuts?

28:35.367 --> 28:37.767
Lou, I would've had to have sex
in front of another guy.

28:37.802 --> 28:38.832
So block him out.

28:38.867 --> 28:40.367
What if I got hit
with friendly fire?

28:40.402 --> 28:41.867
Well, then make sure
you're done first

28:41.902 --> 28:43.432
and get the hell
out of the way.

28:43.467 --> 28:45.032
You know, Jesus,
it's true what they say.

28:45.067 --> 28:48.800
Three-ways, like youth,
are wasted on the young.

28:48.835 --> 28:52.332
Get that line stretched,
will you?

28:52.367 --> 28:54.634
Tommy, Franco, Sean.
Grab some of those chucks.

28:54.669 --> 28:56.399
I want to shore up the SUV

28:56.434 --> 28:58.234
to make sure
it doesn't tip over on us.

28:58.269 --> 28:59.199
All right.

28:59.234 --> 29:00.432
I got a sawbuck that says

29:00.467 --> 29:03.201
the driver
in the SUV was drunk.

29:03.236 --> 29:04.468
I'll take that bet.

29:04.503 --> 29:05.665
- Yeah?
- Let's do it.

29:05.722 --> 29:07.464
What's the matter with you,
Franco?

29:07.522 --> 29:09.451
Nothing. I'm good.

29:09.501 --> 29:11.200
Five paramedics on scene.

29:11.235 --> 29:12.900
Check underneath,
all right?

29:14.334 --> 29:15.566
All right. Hang on, sir.

29:15.601 --> 29:17.650
We're going to get you
out of there, okay?

29:17.685 --> 29:19.700
- Smells like I win, huh?
- Yeah. You win. Jesus.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.199
Can you feel your fingers
and your toes?

29:28.234 --> 29:30.734
Hey, Tommy, I need a neck collar
and a long board.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.234
Silletti? I need a collar
and a long board now.

29:33.269 --> 29:34.665
Okay. Got it.

29:34.700 --> 29:36.017
You feel that?
All right.

29:36.052 --> 29:37.299
Just be patient, all right?

29:37.334 --> 29:39.050
We're gonna
get you out of here.

29:39.085 --> 29:40.767
Conscious.
And the driver is--

29:42.201 --> 29:44.134
Come on, Silletti.

29:47.967 --> 29:48.965
Christ, it looks like

29:49.000 --> 29:51.201
they're pulling a kid
out of that car.

29:55.833 --> 29:57.483
Tommy, I need you
to stay over here.

29:57.518 --> 29:59.134
Stay over here
and help these guys.

29:59.169 --> 30:00.534
I think I may know that driver.

30:00.569 --> 30:01.765
Just stay over here.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.934
Go over there and
help the guys get the--

30:03.969 --> 30:05.367
Tommy, come on.
Help these guys.

30:05.402 --> 30:06.466
What's going on, man?

30:06.501 --> 30:08.201
Nothing's going on.
Just stay here.

30:08.236 --> 30:10.900
Guys? Franco!

30:10.935 --> 30:11.967
Shit.

30:21.134 --> 30:22.767
- Hi, this is Colleen.
- Oh, my God!

30:22.802 --> 30:23.732
Tommy! Tommy!

30:23.767 --> 30:25.000
Tommy, take it easy!

30:25.035 --> 30:26.051
Tommy!

30:26.086 --> 30:27.032
No, no.

30:27.067 --> 30:28.267
Take it easy.
Come on.

30:30.234 --> 30:31.366
Tommy, listen to me!

30:31.401 --> 30:32.999
Is she dead?
Is she dead?

30:33.034 --> 30:35.733
She's hurt bad, Tommy,
but she's alive. Okay?

30:35.768 --> 30:38.151
Now, you got to let
the EMTs

30:38.186 --> 30:40.499
do their job. Okay?
Okay, Tommy?

30:40.534 --> 30:42.733
Now, listen, we're going to
get you in the chief's car,

30:42.768 --> 30:44.568
we're going to take you
to the hospital. Okay?

30:44.603 --> 30:45.566
That's the deal.

30:45.601 --> 30:46.765
Okay?
That's the deal.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.201
Now, I'm going
to get the truck

30:48.236 --> 30:49.201
right now, Tommy.
Okay?

30:49.236 --> 30:50.166
Now, you're okay.

30:50.201 --> 30:51.733
She's okay. She's alive.

30:51.768 --> 30:52.901
Okay.

30:52.936 --> 30:53.999
Okay?

30:54.034 --> 30:55.566
Oh, my God.

30:55.601 --> 30:57.267
She's going to be
all right, Tommy.

31:14.733 --> 31:16.150
- Hey.
- Where is she?

31:16.185 --> 31:17.568
They're working on her.

31:17.603 --> 31:18.566
I want to see her.

31:18.601 --> 31:19.965
No, you can't.
Believe me, I tried.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.201
Who's in charge here?
Who do I have to talk to?

31:22.236 --> 31:24.234
Did you know she was coming
into the city?

31:24.269 --> 31:25.599
No. I told her she couldn't go.

31:25.634 --> 31:27.233
- That's what I told her.
- Well, that's it.

31:27.268 --> 31:28.833
She's never allowed
to see this kid again.

31:28.868 --> 31:29.932
Roger...

31:29.967 --> 31:32.167
What, do I have to be related
to care about her?

31:32.202 --> 31:33.568
Is that how
it's got to be?

31:33.603 --> 31:34.932
Tommy.

31:34.967 --> 31:36.533
Come on. Come on, guys.
Come on.

31:36.568 --> 31:38.100
Hey, hey. Wrong time,
wrong place.

31:38.135 --> 31:39.534
Come on, now.

31:39.569 --> 31:40.899
It's okay, Janet.

31:40.934 --> 31:42.833
Don't let this yuppie
asshole get under your skin.

31:42.868 --> 31:43.899
I heard that.

31:43.934 --> 31:48.367
Douche bag, you come in here
on a visit...

31:48.402 --> 31:52.765
You want to be a patient?
It's your call.

31:52.800 --> 31:56.668
Manhattan to Battalion 1-5,
Manhattan to Battalion 1-5.

31:56.703 --> 31:59.733
Battalion 1-5 to Manhattan,
respond to the box.

31:59.768 --> 32:00.934
Tommy, look, we got to go.

32:00.969 --> 32:02.099
All right. Thanks.

32:02.134 --> 32:03.534
Let us know how you
make out.

32:03.569 --> 32:04.499
Okay.

32:04.534 --> 32:06.100
She's going to be okay.

32:12.934 --> 32:15.334
See you, guys.

32:20.601 --> 32:22.833
Tommy, I can't get
any answers in there.

32:22.868 --> 32:24.132
You know what?

32:24.167 --> 32:26.367
What did I tell you, huh?
What did I tell you?

32:26.402 --> 32:27.533
Get the hell off of me!

32:27.568 --> 32:29.267
I told you to get
your priorities straight.

32:29.302 --> 32:30.967
You wanted to be
in charge of the kids.

32:31.002 --> 32:32.184
She's laying
in a hospital bed

32:32.219 --> 32:34.059
while you're trying
to get laid

32:34.094 --> 32:35.900
with your loser
goddamn boyfriend!

32:37.201 --> 32:38.734
And where have you been?

32:38.769 --> 32:40.232
Where was I? At work!

32:40.267 --> 32:41.432
Paying your goddamn bills!

32:41.467 --> 32:43.067
Tommy, this isn't about
our bullshit.

32:43.102 --> 32:44.668
This is about our little girl
in there.

32:44.703 --> 32:45.798
Don't tell me.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.534
Goddamn you, Tommy.

32:50.267 --> 32:52.534
It's on your head!

32:58.934 --> 33:00.000
Colleen Gavin's
parents?

33:00.035 --> 33:00.934
Yeah, right here.

33:03.601 --> 33:04.899
Okay.

33:04.934 --> 33:07.367
Your daughter has sustained
trauma to the head.

33:07.402 --> 33:08.399
Can we see her?

33:08.434 --> 33:09.833
Not yet. We're still
working on her.

33:09.868 --> 33:11.166
Is she gonna be okay?

33:11.201 --> 33:13.401
I can't say just yet.
I have to get back inside.

33:13.436 --> 33:14.765
I just wanted to let you know

33:14.800 --> 33:16.798
that she's being
well taken care of.

33:16.915 --> 33:19.138
Doctor, we're just trying
to get some information--

33:19.184 --> 33:20.913
Hey, hey, what did I tell you?
Huh?

33:20.954 --> 33:23.152
Get him out of here before I put
his head through the window.

33:23.202 --> 33:24.767
Good time to pick a fight.

33:24.802 --> 33:26.232
Shut up!

33:26.267 --> 33:28.867
Roger, please.
Leave.

33:28.902 --> 33:30.065
What?

33:30.100 --> 33:32.033
This is causing
too much confusion,

33:32.068 --> 33:33.967
and I can't handle the stress
anymore.

33:34.002 --> 33:35.384
Can I please
talk to you?

33:35.419 --> 33:36.767
Roger, no! Just leave.

34:30.934 --> 34:32.766
You faxed this
to the commissioner's office?

34:32.802 --> 34:33.831
What?

34:33.867 --> 34:36.367
"Stick it up your ass"?

34:36.402 --> 34:37.533
Oh, yeah.

34:37.568 --> 34:40.034
I thought they might enjoy
a speedy response.

34:40.069 --> 34:40.998
Real smart.

34:41.034 --> 34:42.466
You got your wish.

34:42.501 --> 34:44.800
They're giving you a hearing
a week from today.

34:44.835 --> 34:46.534
You also got yourself
suspended.

34:46.569 --> 34:48.065
What?

34:48.100 --> 34:50.483
The commissioner didn't see
the humor in your fax.

34:50.518 --> 34:52.867
He wants you out of the house,
effective immediately.

34:52.902 --> 34:54.717
What are you talking about?

34:54.753 --> 34:56.534
You don't understand English?

34:56.569 --> 34:59.434
You... are... suspended.

34:59.469 --> 35:01.151
Go home.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.833
Now.

35:07.967 --> 35:09.332
I love you, baby.

35:09.367 --> 35:12.401
Give me a call soon, okay?

35:13.668 --> 35:14.832
It's me, lover boy.

35:14.867 --> 35:16.800
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

35:16.835 --> 35:18.118
Hi.

35:18.153 --> 35:19.343
Hey.

35:19.378 --> 35:20.534
Here.

35:22.601 --> 35:24.967
The doctor said
there's still no change.

35:25.002 --> 35:26.100
Next couple of hours are key.

35:35.401 --> 35:37.833
You know what? I'll be back.

35:37.868 --> 35:39.551
Where are you going?

35:39.586 --> 35:41.234
I got to go see someone.

35:41.269 --> 35:43.467
Typical.

36:14.367 --> 36:17.332
Hey, coz.

36:17.367 --> 36:19.267
Thought you might
be stopping by.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.232
Hey, Mick.

36:20.267 --> 36:21.201
You looking for me?

36:23.967 --> 36:26.067
Looking for him, actually.

36:26.102 --> 36:30.199
But... you'll do.

36:30.234 --> 36:32.434
I didn't see your car out front.

36:32.469 --> 36:35.035
I was at Joey Fuller's
wake.

36:35.070 --> 36:38.435
Joey Fuller from our class?

36:38.470 --> 36:41.765
Heart attack,
two days ago.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.733
Dropped dead at his daughter's
Little League game.

36:43.768 --> 36:45.833
41 years old.

36:45.868 --> 36:47.667
Shit.

36:47.702 --> 36:49.467
Sorry.

36:52.334 --> 36:53.601
Heard about Colleen.

36:53.636 --> 36:55.099
Yeah.

36:55.134 --> 36:56.733
I'm going to try
and get over there.

36:56.768 --> 36:58.267
She okay?

36:58.302 --> 36:59.732
Not yet.

36:59.767 --> 37:02.733
So you're stopping by
to say a prayer?

37:02.768 --> 37:06.267
Maybe.

37:14.334 --> 37:16.934
I remember when you baptized her
right up there on that altar.

37:16.969 --> 37:17.899
Yep.

37:17.934 --> 37:20.367
She smiled.

37:20.402 --> 37:22.765
She did.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.965
Most babies cry.
She smiled.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.432
I remember standing up
at that altar and...

37:30.467 --> 37:35.668
watching Janet walk down
that aisle on our wedding day.

37:35.703 --> 37:37.034
Man, she was beautiful.

37:37.069 --> 37:38.700
Yeah.

37:42.900 --> 37:44.668
I don't know, Mick.

37:47.900 --> 37:49.950
Sometimes I just...

37:49.985 --> 37:51.965
I wish I could go back.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.134
Even just a couple of years.
Do some things different.

37:56.169 --> 37:58.568
Look, Tom, God has a certain--

37:58.603 --> 38:00.232
Ahh.

38:00.267 --> 38:03.167
Don't give me the "God has
a certain plan" speech.

38:03.202 --> 38:05.366
Please?

38:05.401 --> 38:09.299
I remember when we were kids,
man,

38:09.334 --> 38:11.234
this place really meant
something, you know?

38:12.668 --> 38:15.201
No matter how bad things were
in the world,

38:15.236 --> 38:17.351
how many Mansons there were,

38:17.386 --> 38:19.432
how many Kennedys they killed,

38:19.467 --> 38:22.833
we knew on Sundays,
we'd come in here for an hour,

38:22.868 --> 38:24.501
and everything was going to be
all right.

38:24.536 --> 38:27.698
Tom, I, uh...

38:27.733 --> 38:29.534
I don't know what
you want me to say.

38:29.569 --> 38:32.000
Mick...

38:35.833 --> 38:39.100
I want you to say
that it's all...

38:39.135 --> 38:40.201
It's bullshit.

38:40.236 --> 38:41.533
You know?

38:41.568 --> 38:44.698
There is no plan,
there is no map.

38:44.733 --> 38:46.934
There's no golden ring
at the end of the ride.

38:46.969 --> 38:49.301
It's just...

38:49.336 --> 38:51.135
bullshit.

38:51.170 --> 38:52.934
You know?

38:58.034 --> 38:59.617
I want you to take away
the hope, man.

38:59.652 --> 39:01.201
That's the thing
that's killing me.

39:01.236 --> 39:03.335
It's just...

39:03.370 --> 39:05.399
It's like, uh...

39:05.434 --> 39:07.698
I'm just hanging here, man.

39:07.733 --> 39:11.334
Hope is making me think I can
fix my marriage, you know?

39:14.100 --> 39:18.965
The day of Jimmy's funeral...

39:19.000 --> 39:23.150
You stood up on that altar
and you said sometimes...

39:23.185 --> 39:27.301
we don't know why God does
the things that he does.

39:30.733 --> 39:32.700
But I'm telling you...

39:37.434 --> 39:40.199
Mick...

39:40.234 --> 39:43.833
if he takes
my little girl tonight...

39:43.868 --> 39:46.199
I'm gonna wanna know why.

39:46.234 --> 39:48.568
That's why you got to
hold on to the hope, Tom.

39:48.603 --> 39:50.485
Because in the end...

39:50.520 --> 39:52.367
that's all we got left.

40:00.367 --> 40:02.967
I'm gonna hang around
for a little bit.

40:03.002 --> 40:03.900
Take your time.

40:19.568 --> 40:22.568
I found out the results
of the test!

40:22.603 --> 40:24.199
She's your baby,
Frankie!

40:27.735 --> 40:28.832
Shit.

40:56.369 --> 40:57.299
What's wrong?

41:00.469 --> 41:03.499
I might need a minute here.

I, uh...

41:24.401 --> 41:26.634

41:34.469 --> 41:38.965

41:39.000 --> 41:43.434

41:43.469 --> 41:46.900
see to it
that maybe that changes.
