WISDOM OF THE CROWD #101
"Pilot"
Closed Captioned

00:03.304 --> 00:05.239
Hey, Dad, um, your office said
you're out of town,

00:05.273 --> 00:07.241
so, figured you'd like
the personal touch.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.243
(chuckles)

00:09.277 --> 00:13.281
Anyways, um, can't wait
to see you tomorrow.

00:13.314 --> 00:16.250
Hey, I know I probably
don't say this enough,

00:16.284 --> 00:18.286
but I love you, Dad.

00:18.319 --> 00:20.654
And, um, I know
we've had our problems,

00:20.688 --> 00:23.357
but I wouldn't be
who I am without you.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.193
So...

00:25.226 --> 00:26.527
Anyways, travel safe.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.162
Love you.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.530
I already said that, didn't I?

00:29.563 --> 00:32.266
(laughs)
Okay, bye.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.434
(beep)

00:33.467 --> 00:36.070
*

00:36.104 --> 00:38.472
REPORTER:
You're watching a live feed

00:38.506 --> 00:40.441
from AllSourcer headquarters
in Silicon Valley,

00:40.474 --> 00:44.078
where Jeffrey Tanner,
the notoriously driven CEO

00:44.112 --> 00:45.846
behind the popular
social media aggregator

00:45.879 --> 00:47.581
has called a press conference.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.153
It's pennies on the dollar.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.655
Are you sure
you want to do this?

00:54.688 --> 00:57.458
It's already done.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.295
REPORTER:
Now, given the timing

01:01.329 --> 01:04.532
and the rumors
swirling around the company,

01:04.565 --> 01:06.667
speculation abounds as to what
he's going to announce today.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.237
(reporters speaking
in foreign languages)

01:09.270 --> 01:10.638
(crowd cheering)

01:13.374 --> 01:15.476
REPORTER:
We'll go live to Palo Alto,

01:15.509 --> 01:17.245
where he's making his way
to the podium now.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.579
(cheering continues)

01:18.612 --> 01:20.448
TANNER:
Thank you.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.550
Thank you.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.518
Please, everyone, listen.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.654
Listen, I don't, I don't know
if you got the memo,

01:26.687 --> 01:29.457
but I also will not be
releasing my tax returns.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.325
(laughter)

01:31.359 --> 01:32.660
(camera clicks)

01:35.229 --> 01:37.365
(cameras clicking)

01:37.398 --> 01:39.367
Um...

01:39.400 --> 01:40.501
(exhales)

01:40.534 --> 01:42.536
I just signed an agreement

01:42.570 --> 01:44.905
giving up ownership
of AllSourcer.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.640
(crowd murmuring)

01:46.674 --> 01:50.278
So the rumors are true: I'm out.

01:50.311 --> 01:53.414
The question you're all probably
asking yourself is why.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.417
So I'm gonna try to explain it,

01:56.450 --> 01:58.452
as best I can. Um...

02:01.522 --> 02:03.657
*

02:03.691 --> 02:05.659
(clears throat)

02:09.263 --> 02:10.931
Next week is
the one-year anniversary

02:10.964 --> 02:12.700
of my daughter Mia's death.

02:12.733 --> 02:16.537
More accurately, her murder.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.706
You all know the story.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.375
The press covered it
in excruciating detail.

02:21.409 --> 02:24.545
But I-I have to tell you,

02:24.578 --> 02:28.416
unless you have lost
a child yourself...

02:34.688 --> 02:39.260
...you can never know
what it does to you.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.562
BRIAN:
Your schedule, Congresswoman.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.564
What do we have?
You have a constituent
meet and greet.

02:43.597 --> 02:44.965
Your briefing at noon.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.434
Flight's at 3:00.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.968
Hi, I'm so sorry I'm late.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.537
The Beltway.
(Tanner speaking over TV)

02:49.570 --> 02:50.671
Hi, John. How are you?

02:50.704 --> 02:52.573
Katherine.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.642
MAN: With all due respect,
Congressman...

02:54.675 --> 02:57.678
Um, can you, can you just turn
that back for a moment, please?

02:57.711 --> 03:01.449
But the wheels
of justice turned,

03:01.482 --> 03:03.484
and they caught
and convicted the man

03:03.517 --> 03:06.387
they believe to have murdered
my daughter, a former addict

03:06.420 --> 03:10.224
named Carlos Ochoa,
who worked at the shelter

03:10.258 --> 03:12.660
where my daughter
was interning.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.263
Just knowing that her killer
is behind bars

03:15.296 --> 03:17.298
should bring me
some comfort, some closure.

03:17.331 --> 03:19.500
The only problem is this:

03:19.533 --> 03:22.570
I think they got the wrong guy.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.704
(elevator bell dings)

03:23.737 --> 03:25.406
TANNER:
I now have evidence,

03:25.439 --> 03:28.309
evidence that has never
been made public,

03:28.342 --> 03:30.478
evidence that leads me
to believe...

03:30.511 --> 03:31.679
Hey.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.414
What's going on?
Tommy.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.448
TANNER: ...that they have
incarcerated the wrong man.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.317
See this?

03:36.350 --> 03:39.320
And whoever did this to
my daughter is still out there.

03:39.353 --> 03:42.490
And I believe that more evidence
would emerge

03:42.523 --> 03:45.826
if a platform existed
for it to be brought forward.

03:45.859 --> 03:49.029
And that is why
I have created that platform.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.266
I call it Sophe.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.634
And as of right now...

03:58.506 --> 04:00.274
...it is active.

04:00.308 --> 04:05.713
Sophe is real time
crowdsourced crime solving.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.616
It's a hub
where people can submit

04:08.649 --> 04:09.850
and dissect evidence.
Ma!

04:09.883 --> 04:11.619
WOMAN (in distance):
Damn it, what?

04:11.652 --> 04:14.822
Sophe was the Greek
personification of wisdom--

04:14.855 --> 04:15.823
your wisdom.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.425
The cops, the courts,

04:17.458 --> 04:18.492
they can only do so much.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.394
The rest is up to us.

04:20.428 --> 04:24.465
I truly believe that Sophe

04:24.498 --> 04:27.435
will revolutionize
crime solving.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.404
And to prove it, I am offering
a powerful incentive.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.473
$100 million

04:32.506 --> 04:35.709
to anyone that can help identify
(crowd murmuring)

04:35.743 --> 04:37.645
or apprehend the killer
of my daughter.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.413
Holy crap.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.281
Deputy chief wants to see us.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.884
Now.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.686
My money is on you.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.521
All of you.

04:47.555 --> 04:50.658
Good luck.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.360
Let's get to work.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.561
(applause)

04:53.594 --> 04:55.563
*

05:04.672 --> 05:06.507
(birds chirping)

05:06.540 --> 05:08.642
TANNER:
I should've told you first.

05:08.676 --> 05:09.777
I know that.

05:09.810 --> 05:13.381
Would've been nice.
(chuckles)

05:13.414 --> 05:14.848
But we both know what
you would've said.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.550
Which is what?

05:16.584 --> 05:18.819
That Mia's killer's
in prison, right?

05:18.852 --> 05:22.523
Where he belongs.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.857
Jeffrey, it's over.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.560
Please, just let this be over.

05:26.594 --> 05:29.630
You know what I can't stop
thinking about? St. Barts.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.766
Before we split up; her
running through those waves.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.804
Do you remember that?

05:36.837 --> 05:39.873
I remember she got
the stomach flu.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.876
She threw up all night.

05:42.910 --> 05:46.414
Two days later,
I got it.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.149
I guess it's just
how we see things, you know?

05:49.182 --> 05:50.518
Good and the bad.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.486
I should've been there.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.654
Should've been there.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.457
Please,
just stop this.

05:58.492 --> 06:02.362
Nothing that you do
is gonna bring her back.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.902
(clears throat softly)

06:11.472 --> 06:13.774
I have to go.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.954
You were a good dad.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.589
I wasn't.
Hmm.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.424
But thank you
for saying that.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.493
Thank you.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.762
Well, I-- don't get me wrong,
you were a terrible husband.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.430
That's more like it.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.499
Yes. Awful.
Thank you.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.501
But you were a good dad.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.470
Thank you.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.513
CAVANAUGH:
Where the hell am I?

06:52.546 --> 06:54.515
RUIZ: Come on, Tommy,
you must be loving this.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.484
You thought we got
the wrong guy all along.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.551
You even got yourself kicked off

06:57.585 --> 06:58.786
the case because of it.

06:58.819 --> 06:59.787
Should've kept my mouth shut.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.055
I'd have made lieutenant, too.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.423
Hold on.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.629
Detective Cavanaugh, SFPD.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.931
Well, Tanner asked just for you.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.900
So now's your chance
to prove us all wrong.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.568
Have fun in Silicon Valley.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.537
Yeah, well,

07:16.570 --> 07:18.005
not exactly.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.944
Detective Cavanaugh.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.679
Thank you for coming.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.914
I was sent.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.049
There's a difference.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.885
Oakland-- I mean, um, that's a
little ghetto for you, isn't it?

07:31.919 --> 07:34.922
Well, from humble beginnings
come big things.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.957
(chuckles)
100 million of them.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.560
Yeah. Not about the
money, Detective.

07:39.593 --> 07:42.095
People want to be a part
of something meaningful.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.831
This is Sara Morton.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.699
She's in charge of
day-to-day for Sophe.

07:45.733 --> 07:46.867
SARA:
Detective.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.869
Here, you'll be needing this.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.907
(metal clattering in distance)

07:53.941 --> 07:56.644
This Sophe Web thing,
what does it do exactly?

07:56.677 --> 07:58.979
Hundred years ago,
there was a scientist,

07:59.012 --> 08:01.649
Sir Francis Galton; he
went to a county fair,

08:01.682 --> 08:06.754
he asked 800 people to guess the
weight of a prize-winning ox.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.889
No one could get it
exactly right.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.592
But then, when he averaged in
all of the answers,

08:11.625 --> 08:12.926
they were dead on,

08:12.960 --> 08:15.596
within a half a pound.
Half a pound.

08:15.629 --> 08:16.930
That's what it does.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.132
Wisdom of the
crowd, huh?
Yep.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.134
It's a nice story; you
should post it online.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.736
You'd get a ton of likes.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.304
SARA:
You're a skeptic.

08:24.337 --> 08:28.141
I just know there's a reason
why cops solve crimes.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.610
For one thing, we know
how to gather evidence

08:29.643 --> 08:30.778
so it's admissible.

08:30.811 --> 08:31.979
The chain of custody
is clear

08:32.012 --> 08:33.614
for any evidence
posted on the site.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.782
(door opens)

08:35.983 --> 08:37.718
CAVANAUGH:
Yeah, maybe.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.587
But we have this thing

08:39.620 --> 08:42.723
called the Constitution,
which protects people's privacy.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.658
(laughs):
Privacy?
Yes.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.894
We gave that up a long time ago
so we could watch cat videos

08:46.927 --> 08:47.895
on our phone.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.936
Welcome to The Hive, Detective.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.740
What the hell is this?

08:59.773 --> 09:02.843
This is where we
maintain the Sophe

09:02.876 --> 09:04.778
CrowdTec database
and monitor the platform.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.947
We vet any evidence
before it's posted,

09:06.980 --> 09:09.182
and then we can pull it up
at the stroke of a key.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.051
(beeping)

09:11.084 --> 09:12.786
Those are just posts
to the site, Officer.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.187
Uh, nothing
interesting yet.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.056
Sir. Officer.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.659
You really think all
this is gonna work?

09:18.692 --> 09:20.193
I know it'll work.
I tested it.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.829
I wanted to hold

09:21.862 --> 09:24.097
a memorial for Mia
at her school.

09:24.131 --> 09:27.968
I used Sophe to contact everyone
in her program at Berkeley.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.803
Half the students

09:29.837 --> 09:33.674
told me to speak to
someone named Lori Meyers.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.108
Who's Lori Meyers?
Exactly.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.711
I didn't know either.
But the crowd knew.

09:37.745 --> 09:40.681
The crowd knew that
her and Lori were close.

09:40.714 --> 09:41.915
They hadn't known
each other long,

09:41.949 --> 09:43.183
but Sophe found her anyway.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.818
TANNER:
I just wanted Lori to say

09:45.953 --> 09:47.220
a few things at the memorial,
but instead she gave me this.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.822
Go ahead.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.824
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Next message.

09:50.858 --> 09:54.795
Sent September 26th
at 10:36 p.m.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.797
That's the night Mia was killed.

09:56.830 --> 10:00.701
MIA (panting):
Lori, it's, uh, i-it's Mia.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.870
I'm, uh...

10:02.903 --> 10:04.237
I-I don't know who else to call.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.974
Um, I'm...
I'm afraid he's gonna hurt me.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.109
He won't leave me alone.
(thump)

10:09.142 --> 10:12.179
God, I'm falling apart.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.814
(crying softly)

10:16.817 --> 10:19.252
Okay, just, um, just call me
when you get this, okay?

10:19.286 --> 10:20.721
Okay.

10:20.754 --> 10:21.889
(line clicks)

10:27.695 --> 10:30.263
I can tell by your face
you never heard that.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.166
But your old partner, Detective
Ruiz, she had it all along.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.935
Just kept it from me.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.070
And apparently you as well.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.009
CAVANAUGH:
So you knew about this?

10:42.042 --> 10:45.212
Yes. But she's talking about
Carlos Ochoa in the message.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.881
Then why didn't the D.A.
use it at trial?

10:47.915 --> 10:49.950
Because Lori Meyers wouldn't
back it up on the stand.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.218
She said Mia was
talking about

10:51.251 --> 10:53.754
someone else, some
secret boyfriend

10:53.787 --> 10:55.723
that no one had
ever seen before.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.825
Look, Tommy, we gave this
to defense counsel.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.760
They didn't
want it either.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.829
Even they thought she was
talking about Carlos Ochoa.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.897
Then why didn't anyone
share this with Tanner?

11:03.931 --> 11:05.766
That was the D.A.'s call.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.701
They didn't want anything
giving him doubts at trial.

11:07.735 --> 11:10.170
Look, Carlos Ochoa
had her house key.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.772
We found his semen inside her.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.140
Because they were
having consensual sex.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.842
That's what he said.
Did she say anything else?

11:14.875 --> 11:16.309
Nothing that made sense.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.179
Something ab... something
about a sports shop.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.714
Here.

11:20.748 --> 11:21.982
Sports shop?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.817
What, like
a sporting goods store?

11:23.851 --> 11:27.120
I'm telling you,
it's a dead end.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.056
She was talking about someone
on that message.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.190
Yeah, Carlos Ochoa.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.992
Look, if you want
to chase this goose,

11:32.025 --> 11:33.160
you go right ahead. Okay?

11:33.193 --> 11:34.494
But you're not
gonna find anything.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.796
You want to know why?

11:35.829 --> 11:37.264
There's no other guy, Tommy!

11:37.297 --> 11:39.032
(evidence alert beeping)

11:42.269 --> 11:44.004
(evidence alert blaring)
So, what's going on?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.505
What is this sound?

11:45.538 --> 11:47.775
That's when a Sophe user
posts evidence.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.777
It works.
Show it to him.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.211
This just came in.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.279
11:37 p.m.,

11:52.312 --> 11:53.981
the night Mia was killed.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.152
SARA:
That's Mia's building.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.888
(woman talking over video)

12:00.921 --> 12:02.355
TANNER:
There you are,

12:02.389 --> 12:03.957
you son of a bitch.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.725
I knew it.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.798
He's too tall
to be Carlos Ochoa.

12:10.831 --> 12:11.765
So, who is it?

12:13.801 --> 12:15.769
The other guy.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.910
CAVANAUGH: Okay.
WOMAN: Isn't it
so beautiful at night?

12:22.943 --> 12:25.245
They light it up,
and sometimes they change color.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.880
Yes, yes.
The Coit Tower.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.982
Yes, I know. Um...

12:29.016 --> 12:31.952
Oh, and right there, they have
amazing Thai spring rolls.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.254
The crunch is the best.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.923
(chuckles)
Thank you.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.791
Um, now, you shot this
with your phone, correct?

12:37.825 --> 12:38.892
Yes.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.360
Okay, now...

12:40.393 --> 12:42.395
We were Airbnbing at the place
across the street.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.264
"We"?
Me and my ex-boyfriend.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.432
The scumbag.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.035
It was my first trip
to San Francisco,

12:48.068 --> 12:49.469
so I was shooting
everything.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.039
Coit Tower, the sky.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.808
Um, Ms. Li, why didn't you
come forward at the time?

12:54.842 --> 12:56.443
Well, like I said,
I'm from out of town.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.078
I wasn't really
following the case

12:58.111 --> 12:59.947
until I saw
the announcement.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.949
Jeffrey Tanner is a genius.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.084
Can I meet him now?

13:04.117 --> 13:06.386
Yeah. Yeah, I'll check on that.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.495
You still work here?

13:15.528 --> 13:17.030
Regrettably, yes.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.533
God, you were serious.

13:20.567 --> 13:25.873
I thought, I don't know,
maybe sanity would prevail.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.875
How long you known me, Mike?

13:27.908 --> 13:30.277
And I begged you,
just wait a few years,

13:30.310 --> 13:33.080
and you could've sold AllSourcer
for five times what you got.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.915
And I said that
it had to be now.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.850
Three rounds of venture capital,
and you kept deluding yourself.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.618
You barely walked
away with anything.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.620
I was never comfortable
with the money, anyway.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.055
That's what
my therapist told me.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.390
Jeffrey.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.893
Look, I'm telling you this

13:45.926 --> 13:47.861
not as your lawyer
or your financial advisor,

13:47.895 --> 13:50.297
but as your friend.

13:50.330 --> 13:54.001
This, whatever this is...

13:54.034 --> 13:55.435
it will destroy you.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.638
I don't care.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.874
The-the cost of running
a place like this,

14:00.908 --> 14:02.575
paying everyone with
no revenue coming in,

14:02.609 --> 14:04.577
there's no way...
Mike, I don't care.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.113
This is it.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.448
This is what I'm doing.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.418
Get used to it.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.520
Excuse me.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.959
Good choice
on the lobster tacos.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.894
Any luck I.D.'ing that man
in the video?

14:20.928 --> 14:22.495
We're working on it.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.031
We're canvassing everyone
your daughter knew.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.900
I'm sure the department
is leaving no stone unturned.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.171
Let me ask you a question.
Mm-hmm?

14:31.204 --> 14:32.906
Why me?

14:32.940 --> 14:34.041
Why you ask for me?

14:34.074 --> 14:35.442
(sighs)
Well, I watched you

14:35.475 --> 14:36.443
investigate
my daughter's murder,

14:36.476 --> 14:39.412
and I'm sure you thought
I was a pain in the ass.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.514
You seem like a man
who could think for himself.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.351
And I thought myself
right off the case.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.353
That's because you wouldn't toe
the party line to get ahead.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.554
Unlike your partner...

14:47.587 --> 14:49.923
Ruiz is good police.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.458
Just 'cause I had questions
about your daughter's case

14:51.491 --> 14:52.993
doesn't mean I'm on board
with all this.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.197
Those tacos aren't gonna
eat themselves.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.432
I'll try the taco.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.468
Ah, there you go.
All right.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.704
(clears throat)

15:04.737 --> 15:06.673
That's unbelievable, right?
This is a good taco.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.408
Yeah, it's a good taco.

15:08.441 --> 15:11.011
You know how Steve Jobs
got to be Steve Jobs?

15:11.044 --> 15:12.445
You gonna tell me?

15:12.479 --> 15:14.014
By understanding
human nature.

15:14.047 --> 15:17.384
He understood that
people wanted an iPhone

15:17.417 --> 15:18.986
before they knew
what an iPhone was.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.653
That's what I do.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.956
That's why I know
that this is gonna work.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.557
And that video proves it.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.493
We don't know what
that video proves yet.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.695
Or if a judge is
even gonna allow it.

15:28.728 --> 15:31.131
Listen, get ahead of the curve,
Detective, please.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.166
You're playing by rules
that are obsolete.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.169
No. I know what happens when
you break those rules, Tanner.

15:36.203 --> 15:39.139
Really? The last time
I played by them,

15:39.172 --> 15:41.474
I watched your department
put an innocent man in prison.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.211
Now we're gonna do it my way.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.147
You know what?

15:47.180 --> 15:50.050
I did think you were
a pain in the ass,

15:50.083 --> 15:52.185
and there's nothing I see here
that changes that opinion.

15:52.219 --> 15:55.422
So, if you'll excuse me,
I'll take my tacos over here.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.992
Carlos Ochoa.

15:59.026 --> 16:02.129
(muffled):
What about him?

16:02.162 --> 16:03.630
You showed that video
to everyone that Mia knows.

16:03.663 --> 16:04.664
Did you show it to him?

16:08.235 --> 16:11.004
Ahead of the curve,
Detective.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.140
(bell rings)

16:13.173 --> 16:15.142
(chains rattling)

16:15.175 --> 16:17.544
(door slams, buzzes)

16:31.258 --> 16:33.160
What is this,
some kind of a joke?

16:33.193 --> 16:34.594
CAVANAUGH: We need to ask you
some questions, Carlos.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.563
I already answered
all your questions.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.067
And your little
press conference,

16:40.100 --> 16:41.268
it ain't doing nothing

16:41.301 --> 16:42.569
but making things worse
for me in here.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.737
No, I-I know, Carlos.

16:44.771 --> 16:48.041
Look, I-I'm just trying to
help you get out of here.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.576
(scoffs)

16:49.609 --> 16:51.578
Like I'm ever gonna
get out of here.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.113
We're done.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.317
TANNER:
I saw you with her.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.751
I surprised her one
day at the shelter.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.120
You didn't know
I was there.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.155
I saw the way
you treated her.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.057
The way you
spoke to her.

17:04.091 --> 17:06.526
I stifled those feelings
during the trial

17:06.559 --> 17:08.195
because I wanted to believe
that you were the one.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.562
And then when you wouldn't

17:10.630 --> 17:12.099
plead guilty, not even to
receive a lesser sentence,

17:12.132 --> 17:13.800
that's when I knew.

17:13.833 --> 17:17.270
I'm sorry that I didn't
do something before,

17:17.304 --> 17:19.639
but I'm doing something now.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.144
Please.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.625
Have you ever seen
this guy before?

17:43.163 --> 17:45.632
That's her place.
Yeah.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.834
Mia said something to a friend
about a secret boyfriend.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.103
She ever mention anybody
like that to you?

17:50.137 --> 17:52.539
You think I would've kept that
to myself if she did?

17:52.572 --> 17:54.541
All right.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.744
What about a sports shop?

17:57.777 --> 17:58.845
Does that sound
familiar?

17:58.878 --> 18:00.247
Like, maybe he
used to work there

18:00.280 --> 18:01.381
and that's where
she hung out.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.215
Don't mean nothing to me.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.551
With the luck I have,

18:04.584 --> 18:06.619
that dude's probably
the pizza delivery guy.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.664
I know she had
your name,

18:17.697 --> 18:19.366
but she didn't act like you.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.672
She was beautiful.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.207
She...

18:30.310 --> 18:32.645
She was real.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.915
To tell you the truth,

18:35.948 --> 18:38.585
I couldn't even believe
that she was your daughter.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.191
Neither could I.

18:49.729 --> 18:50.830
We're done.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.243
Boy, you're just
full of surprises.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.677
(phone chimes, vibrates)

19:07.714 --> 19:10.717
What?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.385
We've been hacked.

19:12.419 --> 19:15.288
It just showed up
on the platform?

19:15.322 --> 19:16.723
No chance to vet it.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.391
We've taken it
down for now, but...

19:18.425 --> 19:20.760
pause.
So, I-I don't get...

19:20.793 --> 19:22.962
Somebody hacked us
and-and put up the same video?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.365
It's not exactly the same.
There's more of it now. Watch.

19:27.967 --> 19:30.403
This car-- people think he
might have gotten into it.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.638
Can we get a plate number
on that?

19:33.806 --> 19:35.208
JOSH:
It's too blurry.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.843
Could be a Prius, maybe.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.845
It's San Francisco.
Everyone has a Prius.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.447
CAVANAUGH: That spoiler
looks aftermarket.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.948
Give the department
a couple days.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.850
We might be able
to narrow it down.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.819
Maybe we can do
something faster.

19:46.853 --> 19:50.890
To Sophe users, "Can
you identify this car?"

19:50.923 --> 19:52.659
And send.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.430
How is a bunch of people
arguing on the Internet

19:57.464 --> 19:58.465
better than police work?

19:58.498 --> 20:00.967
Well, individuals have biases

20:01.000 --> 20:02.935
and limited spheres
of knowledge.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.471
The bigger and more diverse
your crowd,

20:04.504 --> 20:06.973
the more you can
overcome that.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.241
It's the 90/10 rule.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.842
The 90/10 what?

20:09.876 --> 20:11.278
Crowdsourcing is
sifting through the dirt

20:11.311 --> 20:13.246
until you find the gold.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.449
90% of anything is garbage,
but 10% of everything,

20:16.483 --> 20:19.386
that's a hell of a lot of bling.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.987
CAVANAUGH:
Flipper.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.289
JOSH:
Flipper Ride Share.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.390
It's a car service app

20:23.423 --> 20:25.958
like Uber or Lyft.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.994
That's not a spoiler.
That's a dolphin tail.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.029
The drivers, they used
to put them on their cars

20:30.062 --> 20:31.831
like the pink mustaches
for Lyft.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.769
You guys don't remember
the pink mustaches?

20:36.803 --> 20:38.305
Unbelievable.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.273
Yup. Got it. Thanks.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.941
Aram Maloof.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.977
Car service records show
that he had a call in the area.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.346
We're looking for him right now.
JOSH:
You better hurry.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.881
It's all over the Web.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.751
People online are
already saying he's guilty.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.920
CAVANAUGH: This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.855
We don't even know
who this guy is yet, Tanner.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.725
There wouldn't even be a problem
if we weren't hacked.

20:58.758 --> 20:59.859
How did that happen?

20:59.892 --> 21:01.861
Anybody?
JOSH:
I don't know yet,

21:01.894 --> 21:03.530
but whoever did it
covered their tracks.

21:03.563 --> 21:06.766
Well, how did the extra footage,
where did it come from?

21:06.799 --> 21:08.034
That was in the file
all along.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.436
What?

21:09.469 --> 21:11.438
Someone on the
tech team reused

21:11.471 --> 21:13.806
code from AllSourcer when
they built the upload interface.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.942
It cuts off videos
longer than 30 seconds,

21:15.975 --> 21:17.877
so Sophe did the same.

21:17.910 --> 21:18.945
TANNER:
Who?

21:18.978 --> 21:19.946
Who what?

21:19.979 --> 21:21.013
Who?! Who?!

21:21.047 --> 21:25.485
Who built the interface
and carelessly took the code

21:25.518 --> 21:28.321
from a completely
separate platform...
No. No, I picked this team.

21:28.355 --> 21:29.956
I will be the one
to discipline them.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.925
Sara, look, this isn't
some grad school project.

21:32.959 --> 21:33.993
Who took the code?

21:34.026 --> 21:35.528
I said no!

21:35.562 --> 21:37.430
If you want to fire someone
for this, fire me.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.336
(phone chimes, vibrates)

21:47.374 --> 21:48.841
(sighs)

21:52.512 --> 21:54.414
Everyone, can you please
get back to work?

21:56.383 --> 21:57.984
He just showed up
at the gate.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.019
And he said he
wants to meet me?

22:00.052 --> 22:03.390
No. He said you're
gonna want to meet him.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.895
All right.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.897
Who the hell are you?

22:10.930 --> 22:12.965
Jeffrey Tanner.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.635
I'm a great admirer
of your work.

22:15.668 --> 22:16.936
Tariq Bakari.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.607
I'm the guy who hacked you.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.983
I use AllSourcer all the time,
but I get annoyed when they

22:31.017 --> 22:33.686
cut off videos; so when I saw
this one was exactly 30 seconds,

22:33.720 --> 22:36.389
I figured they
reused the code.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.558
Typical programmer--
lazy, predictable.

22:38.591 --> 22:39.992
Tell me about it.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.928
You are quite the hacktivist,
Mr. Bakari.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.797
So, how did you do it?
Hack us, I mean.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.834
Ah, I had to use a CSRF-- that's
a cross-site request forgery.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.469
That means you would've

22:49.502 --> 22:50.903
had to compromise
a trusted user's account.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.472
(chuckles):
Yeah.

22:52.505 --> 22:53.573
TANNER:
Whose?

22:53.606 --> 22:55.808
Whose account did you breach?

22:57.744 --> 23:00.480
Um, actually,
it was, uh, yours.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.615
Mr. Tanner, you should

23:02.649 --> 23:03.616
really get a better VPN

23:03.650 --> 23:04.784
for your phone.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.953
Your phones.
(phone vibrating)

23:10.657 --> 23:13.526
Not bad. You want a job?

23:13.560 --> 23:14.994
Put him on
payroll, Mike.

23:16.596 --> 23:17.830
MIKE:
Jeff. Jeffrey.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.533
Have you lost your mind?

23:20.567 --> 23:22.602
Sorry, you're h...
you're hiring him?

23:22.635 --> 23:23.803
Do you want to protect
this platform?

23:23.836 --> 23:24.971
Who better than the kid
that hacked into it?

23:26.706 --> 23:28.541
They found the driver.

23:28.575 --> 23:29.676
County hospital.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.678
Somebody
recognized him.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.880
Next thing you know,
there was a mob.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.815
Lucky we had
a unit nearby.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.552
All right,
here, take this.

23:39.586 --> 23:40.787
Mr. Maloof.

23:41.888 --> 23:42.889
I swear I have nothing to do
with that girl who died.

23:43.856 --> 23:44.290
And these people
just started attacking me...

23:44.323 --> 23:45.792
So, I understand,

23:45.825 --> 23:47.527
just tell me why your car was

23:47.560 --> 23:49.562
outside of Mia Tanner's
apartment the night she died.

23:49.596 --> 23:52.532
I got a call to pick up
a girl from a dance club.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.734
But I got halfway there
and the call was cancelled.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.068
Cancelled?

23:56.102 --> 23:58.771
Yes. So I pulled over
to eat my dinner.

23:58.805 --> 23:59.906
I was there maybe five minutes.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.074
What about the man in the video?

24:02.108 --> 24:03.976
He didn't get in your car?

24:04.010 --> 24:06.513
No, I never saw him.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.980
I swear it.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.716
(knock on glass)

24:09.749 --> 24:11.017
We ran Maloof's GPS.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.586
He had just dropped off
a fare at SFO.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.855
He couldn't have had anything
to do with it.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.525
What are you looking for?

24:18.558 --> 24:20.059
The fare that cancelled
on him that night.

24:22.562 --> 24:23.863
Here.
What?

24:23.896 --> 24:25.732
Tammy Scavuzzo.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.501
He was supposed to pick her up
at this place.

24:28.535 --> 24:30.503
Bar 86.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.140
Just like this girl,
Natalie Kirschner.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.975
She was killed four months ago.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.944
Would've been your case,
but you got that promotion.

24:40.547 --> 24:42.549
Probable sexual assault.

24:42.582 --> 24:43.883
Go on.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.618
Cause of death:
ketamine overdose.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.086
Last place seen: Bar 86,

24:47.119 --> 24:49.556
where she called for a car,
then cancelled it.

24:49.589 --> 24:50.757
You think there's
a connection?

24:50.790 --> 24:52.659
Only one way to find out.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.095
What do you remember, Tammy?

24:56.128 --> 24:58.631
Truthfully, not much.

24:58.665 --> 25:01.534
I was out with girlfriends,
we got split up.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.770
I had too much to drink.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.938
Started feeling woozy.

25:05.972 --> 25:08.174
That's when I ordered the car.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.043
Next thing I knew,
I was waking up on my couch.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.646
Do you often
black out like that?

25:13.680 --> 25:16.683
N-No. I... It was...

25:16.716 --> 25:18.050
Tammy, did anything
make you feel

25:18.084 --> 25:19.986
like you had been
assaulted in any way?

25:21.353 --> 25:22.722
(exhales)

25:24.924 --> 25:27.727
You mean, like...

25:27.760 --> 25:29.762
sexually?

25:29.796 --> 25:31.631
(softly):
Yeah.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.600
Oh, my God.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.806
How much you want to bet
the same guy who raped her

25:39.839 --> 25:41.741
also killed Natalie Kirschner?

25:41.774 --> 25:43.810
This isn't even the case you're
supposed to be working on.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.745
Tanner wants me
to test-drive his new toy.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.113
Let's take it for a spin.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.616
JOSH:
Sara.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.951
Hey.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.753
I just wanted
to say thank you

25:53.786 --> 25:55.788
for standing up
for me earlier.
(sighs)

25:55.822 --> 25:57.657
He's not wrong; I shouldn't
have reused the code,

25:57.690 --> 25:59.091
but we were rushing...
I know.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.660
Just fix it.

26:00.693 --> 26:01.961
Right. Of course.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.999
See you tomorrow, Josh.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.607
(phone chimes, vibrates)

26:21.080 --> 26:22.849
(knock on door)

26:22.882 --> 26:24.651
("Uptown Top Ranking"
by Althea & Donna playing)

26:27.019 --> 26:29.856
You can do better
than apologizing by text.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.123
Ah.

26:31.157 --> 26:32.659
Thank you.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.827
(chuckles)

26:34.861 --> 26:35.995
Wasn't sure
you wanted to see me.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.897
Otherwise, I would've
done it in person.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.132
Mm.
So I'll do it now.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.968
I'm really sorry
about earlier.

26:42.001 --> 26:44.270
I did not mean
to put you on the spot.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.739
It's your sandbox.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.875
Just, um, maybe be...

26:48.908 --> 26:50.677
a little easier on Josh.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.244
The poor boy's

26:52.278 --> 26:54.947
absolutely terrified of you.

26:54.981 --> 26:58.651
And, um...
I think he fancies me.

26:58.685 --> 27:00.653
I actually respect him more now.

27:00.687 --> 27:01.821
(laughs)

27:02.855 --> 27:04.657
So am I gonna have to defend
my territory, or what?

27:04.691 --> 27:07.860
Well, that would require
telling people about us.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.764
Are we ready for that?

27:11.798 --> 27:13.800
We... we will be.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.802
I promise. I will be.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.036
(phone chimes, vibrates)

27:17.069 --> 27:18.037
In the meantime...

27:18.070 --> 27:19.672
Yes.

27:19.706 --> 27:21.908
What I ask--
give it, give it...

27:21.941 --> 27:23.275
(laughs)

27:23.309 --> 27:25.912
...is that when we are
together, you're present.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.079
Yes.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.015
Now, as to the food
in your fridge...

27:29.048 --> 27:30.783
Uh-oh.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.052
...or lack thereof.
(laughs)

27:33.085 --> 27:35.855
What is this?
Are you 12? Pudding?

27:35.888 --> 27:38.825
That, Ma, is
comfort food.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.861

27:45.097 --> 27:47.033
(laughs)

27:47.066 --> 27:48.167
I see what you mean.
Yeah?

27:48.200 --> 27:49.869
It's actually great.
Right? Right?

27:49.902 --> 27:51.971

27:57.343 --> 27:59.111
Jeffrey Tanner,

27:59.145 --> 28:01.881
did you just stop yourself
from checking your phone

28:01.914 --> 28:04.817
without any prompting
whatsoever?

28:04.851 --> 28:07.820
Well, when you put
your mind to it...

28:07.854 --> 28:10.089
It's not really your mind
I'm interested in right now.

28:12.124 --> 28:15.227
* Nah pop no style

28:15.261 --> 28:17.196
* A strictly roots...

28:21.300 --> 28:23.135
(music fades)

28:35.081 --> 28:36.883
*

28:39.886 --> 28:42.021
YOUNG MIA:
Daddy?

28:42.054 --> 28:44.256
(echoing): Daddy, I have
a surprise for you.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.092
(seabirds squawking)

28:46.125 --> 28:49.161
It's a present.

28:49.195 --> 28:50.863
You can keep it.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.832
You can keep it.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.969
(evidence alert beeping)

29:05.177 --> 29:06.779
Look, this isn't gonna work.

29:06.813 --> 29:07.947
We keep running
into a blockchain wall.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.081
Just program a cipher suite
around it.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.249
Can't.
No, look, it's easy.

29:10.282 --> 29:11.784
Hey, kids, glad to see

29:11.818 --> 29:14.353
we're all getting along.
(chuckles)

29:14.386 --> 29:17.824
What's going on? I got an alert.
It's not about Mia.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.992
Okay, what is it about?
CAVANAUGH: The driver
gave us a clue

29:20.026 --> 29:21.828
that helped us make
a breakthrough on another case.

29:21.861 --> 29:22.294
Natalie Kirschner.

29:22.328 --> 29:24.163
TANNER:
Hold on.

29:24.196 --> 29:26.298
What other case?

29:26.332 --> 29:28.034
I thought this whole thing

29:28.067 --> 29:31.037
was supposed to revolutionize
crime solving.

29:31.070 --> 29:34.006
Isn't that what
you said, right?

29:34.040 --> 29:37.176
Sara, can I talk to you
for a second, please?

29:37.209 --> 29:39.045
Please. Come here.

29:41.213 --> 29:43.182
What's happening?
What's going on?

29:43.215 --> 29:45.317
We always knew about the wider
applications to this platform.

29:45.351 --> 29:47.119
Yes, eventually.
It's what we intended.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.121
The more we use Sophe,
the smarter it gets.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.123
After we find Mia's killer.

29:51.157 --> 29:53.059
All this is doing
is splitting our focus.

29:53.092 --> 29:54.426
It's the right thing to do,
Jeffrey,

29:54.460 --> 29:55.394
and you know it.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.997
This is my daughter.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.198
I have to get it right.
Well, we have

29:59.231 --> 30:02.034
an opportunity not just to prove
Sophe works, but to help.

30:02.068 --> 30:03.069
We can't not take it.

30:04.904 --> 30:06.438
(evidence alert blaring)

30:09.108 --> 30:11.010
People are responding.

30:17.383 --> 30:18.985
CAVANAUGH:
So far,

30:19.018 --> 30:20.186
eight other women
have come forward.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.321
All the same,
all blacked out, got in a car,

30:22.354 --> 30:23.956
but the app says
they cancelled it.

30:31.063 --> 30:32.298
Uh, what's it doing now?

30:32.331 --> 30:35.101
It's sorting the responses
by similarities.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.102
It's connecting the dots.

30:36.135 --> 30:37.503
(computer chiming)

30:37.536 --> 30:39.271
SARA:
These four women.

30:39.305 --> 30:41.974
All of them recall
chatting with a bartender.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.243
CAVANAUGH:
Okay, a bartender.

30:44.276 --> 30:47.146
Maybe he spikes their drinks,
even cancels the ride.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.248
He needs an accomplice,
someone who pretends

30:49.281 --> 30:50.950
to be the driver.
CAVANAUGH:
That's right.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.118
SARA: We need
to post this photo.

30:52.151 --> 30:53.452
No, no, not yet.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.321
I do not want another
trial by Internet.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.356
JOSH: Then how do we find
him? All of these women

30:57.389 --> 30:59.926
were at different clubs,
not just Bar 86.

30:59.959 --> 31:02.394
But they're all pop-ups
owned by the same company.

31:02.428 --> 31:03.963
And there's only one bartender

31:03.996 --> 31:06.232
that overlaps those dates:
Eric Buehner.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.336
How'd you do this?

31:10.369 --> 31:12.271
Oh, I can do way better
than that. Here.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.040
Windsor Bistro--
it's a bar in the Marina.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.075
That's where he is now.

31:16.108 --> 31:18.410
Or where
his phone is, anyway.

31:18.444 --> 31:19.912
Sara, how...
what the hell are you doing?!

31:19.946 --> 31:21.147
TANNER:
Well, if I had to guess,

31:21.180 --> 31:23.115
I'd say he reverse-hacked
the guy's GPS.

31:23.149 --> 31:24.917
TARIQ: His cell number
was in his file.

31:24.951 --> 31:27.019
No, no, that is not okay.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.921
Tanner, this is a slippery slope
we're walking on, man.

31:28.955 --> 31:30.322
TARIQ:
Then you find him.

31:30.356 --> 31:34.160
(slowly):
It will just take much longer.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.427
I'm out.

31:35.461 --> 31:36.428
RUIZ:
Windsor Bistro.

31:36.462 --> 31:37.429
I got it.

31:37.463 --> 31:38.998
I'll meet you there.

31:39.031 --> 31:40.099
Don't do it again.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.584
Tammy Scavuzzo? No, sorry,
I don't remember her.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.386
I meet a lot of people
in this job, though.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.620
What about this woman?

32:01.653 --> 32:03.489
Natalie Kirschner.
She ring a bell?

32:03.522 --> 32:04.991
She was the one who
was killed, right?

32:05.024 --> 32:06.058
That's right.

32:06.092 --> 32:08.327
Was she in Bar 86 that night?

32:08.360 --> 32:11.030
Yeah. She was pretty drunk, too,
from what I remember.

32:11.063 --> 32:13.632
Do you have any idea why she
would cancel her car service?

32:13.665 --> 32:16.402
No.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.405
But the bouncer said he saw her
get into a car, though.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.407
RUIZ: Did you serve
her that night?

32:21.440 --> 32:23.042
Yeah.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.977
But there was four of us
working that night, so...

32:25.011 --> 32:26.578
Because she had
ketamine in her system.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.981
Maybe you saw someone
put something in her drink?

32:29.015 --> 32:31.017
No.

32:33.019 --> 32:35.587
If I had,
I-I would have said something.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.689
Thank you for your time.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.058
Yeah.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.000
RUIZ:
Guy's guilty as hell.

32:48.034 --> 32:49.668
He's got to have
an accomplice.

32:49.701 --> 32:52.004
CAVANAUGH: Yeah, but if
he's smart, they won't meet up.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.705
Let's hope he's
not smart, then.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.044
There he goes.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.578
(engine starts)

33:03.582 --> 33:05.584
*

33:10.622 --> 33:12.991
We're in position.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.331
(exhales) He's definitely
meeting somebody.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.109
I have a visual.

33:30.142 --> 33:31.777
All right, wait
for my signal.

33:31.810 --> 33:33.612
POLICEMAN:
Roger that.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.389
We need ears.

33:43.422 --> 33:44.590
TARIQ:
I can get you audio.

33:44.623 --> 33:47.393
If I clone his cell,
it's like a transmitter.

33:47.426 --> 33:48.594
CAVANAUGH: Hey, numb-nuts,
what part of "inadmissible"

33:48.627 --> 33:49.428
do you not get?

33:51.530 --> 33:53.599
Are there any
Sophe users nearby?

33:53.632 --> 33:56.535
I got one in the park.

33:56.568 --> 33:57.703
Julie W.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.605
Contact her.

33:59.638 --> 34:02.174
(phone ringing, vibrating)

34:02.208 --> 34:04.076
(phone beeps)

34:04.110 --> 34:06.845
Hey, Julie. I'm Josh from Sophe.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.614
Kind of weird favor.

34:08.647 --> 34:10.382
We wanted to see
if we could use your phone

34:10.416 --> 34:11.383
as a listening device.

34:16.522 --> 34:17.656
Damn it.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.825
MAN:
What the hell is your problem?

34:19.858 --> 34:21.793
JOSH: Julie, you're doing great.
ERIC: What's my problem?

34:21.827 --> 34:23.162
Just a little closer.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.531
That's good, right there.

34:25.564 --> 34:26.532
MAN (staticky):
They've got nothing.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.634
What the hell
just happened?

34:28.667 --> 34:30.802
It's only inadmissible if you
hack into someone's phone.

34:30.836 --> 34:32.671
We got you a volunteer.

34:32.704 --> 34:35.107
ERIC:
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

34:35.141 --> 34:36.608
MAN:
Keep your voice down.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.712
Been freaking out about
this girl for three months now.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.814
It was an accident.
It's over.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.483
"Over" my ass.

34:44.516 --> 34:45.817
It's all online.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.553
And all these others.

34:47.586 --> 34:49.421
MAN: I don't care
what they put online.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.123
They've got no way
to connect it to us,

34:51.157 --> 34:52.591
and it's going
to stay like that.

34:52.624 --> 34:54.260
All right, we got it.
Get her out of there.

34:54.293 --> 34:55.661
Hey, move in, move in!

34:55.694 --> 34:56.562
(horse neighs)

35:01.167 --> 35:03.135
JOSH:
Julie, get out of there.

35:03.169 --> 35:04.536
Don't even think about it.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.605
Got one suspect in
custody; the other one's

35:06.638 --> 35:07.806
heading south on foot.

35:10.509 --> 35:11.843
CAVANAUGH:
Hey!

35:13.245 --> 35:14.480
RUIZ:
Stop! Police!

35:17.649 --> 35:18.717
(grunts)

35:26.892 --> 35:29.161
(tires screech, horn honks)

35:31.663 --> 35:33.165
(bicycle tires screech)

35:37.803 --> 35:39.471
Where'd he go?!

35:46.912 --> 35:48.780
Damn.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.582
We lost him.

35:57.789 --> 35:58.790
Volkan Ayhan.

35:59.691 --> 36:01.460
Charged with rape in 2009,
in Florida.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.961
Case was dropped.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.263
Now he's in the wind.

36:09.968 --> 36:12.504
(sighs)

36:12.538 --> 36:14.506
Don't make me regret this.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.242
Post it.

36:18.377 --> 36:20.846
Let's do it. Let's go.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.515
All right, I'm gonna
put this up now.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.351
"Have you seen this man?"

36:25.384 --> 36:26.852
(computer beeps)

36:29.488 --> 36:32.258
*

36:32.291 --> 36:34.460

over P.A.)

37:14.300 --> 37:15.501
(ATM beeping)

37:19.471 --> 37:20.939
SARA:
That's him.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.641
Hey, Detective,
we've got a confirmed sighting

37:22.674 --> 37:24.443
at the Holden train station
in Emeryville.

37:24.476 --> 37:25.911
Two more just reported in.

37:25.944 --> 37:28.380
(siren wailing)
On my way. And tell the people

37:28.414 --> 37:29.981
to stay the hell away from him.
Got it.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.950
Ruiz, we got him.
RUIZ: Copy.

37:31.983 --> 37:33.485
(camera clicks)

37:40.992 --> 37:41.960
(camera clicks)

37:46.532 --> 37:49.335
Uh, guys, we got,
like, a thing here.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.469
What sort of thing?

37:54.005 --> 37:55.507
What do you mean,
they're following him?

37:55.541 --> 37:57.376
I said tell them to stay away.

37:57.409 --> 38:00.312
We did. They're doing it
on their own.

38:03.014 --> 38:05.851
WOMAN (over P.A.): Service to
Reno, Salt Lake City, Denver,

38:05.884 --> 38:10.322
Omaha and Chicago,
now boarding on platform five.

38:10.356 --> 38:13.892
All passengers to Los Angeles,
please board on platform four.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.630
I'm telling them to stay back.
They keep moving in.

38:22.368 --> 38:23.602
How far away are the police?

38:42.454 --> 38:45.457
(cameras clicking,
crowd murmuring)

38:45.491 --> 38:47.393
JOSH: Why aren't
they listening to us?

38:47.426 --> 38:48.460
Why aren't they running away?

38:48.494 --> 38:49.595
Because people want to be

38:49.628 --> 38:50.662
a part of
something meaningful.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.740
Stay the hell away from me.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.509
Are you people crazy?!

39:03.542 --> 39:04.610
Get back!
CAVANAUGH:
Police!

39:04.643 --> 39:06.512
Get out of the way!
Now!

39:06.545 --> 39:09.080
Volkan Ayhan, drop
the bag. Drop it!

39:09.114 --> 39:10.582
SARA: Look, one of our users
is streaming the arrest.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.719
CAVANAUGH:
You're under arrest

39:13.752 --> 39:15.421
for the murder
of Natalie Kirschner.

39:15.454 --> 39:16.922

40:25.591 --> 40:28.059
Go ahead.
Well, do the honors.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.495
Tanner, please.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.096
Come on, Detective.

40:31.129 --> 40:33.198
Fine.

40:33.231 --> 40:34.633
All right, what am I doing?

40:34.666 --> 40:35.701
Um, press the
enter button.

40:35.734 --> 40:37.002
(soft laughter)

40:37.035 --> 40:37.536
Oh.

40:39.070 --> 40:41.039
TANNER:
There we go.

40:41.072 --> 40:43.609
(applause)

40:47.613 --> 40:49.815
Detective,
you just closed a case,

40:49.848 --> 40:51.617
a really big case, come on.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.184
Yeah, I'm just sorry
it wasn't the one

40:53.218 --> 40:54.586
you wanted me to
close, that's all.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.555
Well, it's a start.

40:56.588 --> 40:58.524
Yeah.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.058
What?

41:03.161 --> 41:05.764
The state's decided not to
reopen your daughter's case.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.066
They're standing by
their conviction.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.806
Well, I didn't expect them to.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.742
Not until we provide them

41:16.775 --> 41:19.645
with enough evidence
to force their hand.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.749
Good luck with that.

Hey, I know

42:23.809 --> 42:26.111
I probably don't
say this enough, but...

42:26.144 --> 42:27.813
I love you, Dad.

42:27.846 --> 42:29.948
And, um, I know
we've had our problems,

42:29.981 --> 42:32.951
but I wouldn't be
who I am without you.

42:32.984 --> 42:34.653
Anyways, travel safe.

42:34.686 --> 42:35.854
Love you.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.288
I already said that, didn't I?
