00:01.135 --> 00:03.302
<i>As a young girl,</i>
<i>jane was taught</i>

00:03.304 --> 00:04.703
<i>To protect her flower.</i>

00:09.542 --> 00:11.243
<i>And so jane did,</i>

00:11.245 --> 00:12.778
<i>But then she was</i>
<i>accidentally inseminated</i>

00:12.780 --> 00:14.313
<i>With rafael's sperm,</i>

00:14.315 --> 00:16.315
<i>And things got really crazy</i>
<i>from there.</i>

00:16.317 --> 00:20.085
<i>First, jane broke up with</i>
<i>her detective fiancÃ©, michael,</i>

00:20.087 --> 00:21.587
<i>Because she fell for rafael,</i>

00:21.589 --> 00:23.288
<i>But rafael was going</i>
<i>through a lot.</i>

00:23.290 --> 00:25.190
<i>His father died, and his</i>
<i>long-lost mother showed up</i>

00:25.192 --> 00:26.358
<i>And dropped a bomb.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:27.559
<i>So rafael cracked...</i>

00:27.561 --> 00:28.794
Maybe we should
take a break.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.562
<i>...Leaving jane devastated.</i>

00:30.564 --> 00:32.297
<i>And petra realized her mom</i>
<i>was a psycho</i>

00:32.299 --> 00:34.366
<i>Who was pretending to be</i>
<i>in a wheelchair to control her.</i>

00:34.368 --> 00:35.768
Just get out now!

00:35.770 --> 00:38.237
<i>On the bright side,</i>
<i>jane was pursuing her dream.</i>

00:38.239 --> 00:40.272
<i>See, jane wanted to become</i>
<i>a romance writer,</i>

00:40.274 --> 00:43.208
<i>So she joined a writers' group</i>
<i>led by amanda elaine,</i>

00:43.210 --> 00:45.077
<i>And there she met</i>
<i>a new friend, andie.</i>

00:45.079 --> 00:46.745
Hi.
<i>But then jane found out</i>

00:46.747 --> 00:48.580
<i>Andie was only there</i>
<i>to check her out,</i>

00:48.582 --> 00:50.716
<i>Because she used</i>
<i>to date michael.</i>
<i>Hi.</i>

00:50.718 --> 00:52.151
<i>Pretty dramatic stuff.</i>

00:52.153 --> 00:54.186
<i>Also dramatic,</i>

00:54.188 --> 00:55.821
<i>Jane's mother had fallen</i>
<i>in love with her father,</i>

00:55.823 --> 00:58.323
<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>his mother did not approve.</i>

00:58.325 --> 01:01.360
<i>Oh, and remember our criminal,</i>
<i>roman zazo?</i>

01:01.362 --> 01:03.295
<i>Well, his twin brother, aaron,</i>
<i>showed up,</i>

01:03.297 --> 01:04.797
<i>Only it wasn't aaron;</i>
<i>it was roman.</i>

01:04.799 --> 01:06.465
I know you know who I am.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.300
<i>So let's dive in.</i>

01:12.338 --> 01:13.472
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

01:13.474 --> 01:14.740
<i>Sex education.</i>

01:14.742 --> 01:17.543
A rite of passage, if you will.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.311
<i>Alas, since jane went</i>
<i>to a catholic school,</i>

01:19.313 --> 01:22.381
<i>The lesson was rather brief.</i>

01:22.383 --> 01:25.651
Don't do it.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.252
Understand?

01:27.254 --> 01:30.222
<i>Leaving the kids</i>
<i>with questions.</i>

01:30.224 --> 01:31.757
<i>Questions that jane knew</i>
<i>she could help answer.</i>

01:31.759 --> 01:33.092
Young jane:
<i>Okay, good.</i>

01:33.094 --> 01:34.193
Now take your flower

01:34.195 --> 01:35.828
And crumple it up.

01:38.264 --> 01:39.832
Now try to make it
look new again.

01:43.603 --> 01:46.538
That's what happens
when you have sex.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.475
Actually, that's not
what happens.

01:51.511 --> 01:53.345
Trust me, I have four sisters.

01:53.347 --> 01:57.149
I know where everything goes
and when and for how long.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.518
Latin lover narrator: <i>But jane</i>
<i>held on to her version,</i>

01:59.520 --> 02:01.487
<i>To what she knew was right,</i>

02:01.489 --> 02:04.289
<i>And she was determined</i>
<i>to hold on now.</i>

02:04.291 --> 02:06.758
<i>So you know,</i>
<i>it had been exactly</i>

02:06.760 --> 02:08.427
<i>16 hours and 22 minutes</i>

02:08.429 --> 02:11.196
<i>Since rafael</i>
<i>had broken up with jane,</i>

02:11.198 --> 02:13.232
<i>And in that time,</i>
<i>(elevator bell dings)</i>

02:13.234 --> 02:14.533
<i>Jane had cycled rather quickly</i>

02:14.535 --> 02:17.302
<i>Through the seven stages</i>
<i>of grief.</i>

02:24.344 --> 02:25.677
Nothing.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.813
Jane:
<i>He broke up with me, mom!</i>

02:27.815 --> 02:29.314
Can you believe it?!

02:29.316 --> 02:31.183
What a piece of...

02:31.185 --> 02:33.852
Please, god, help him realize
he made a mistake,

02:33.854 --> 02:37.656
And in exchange, I'll send
our daughter to catholic school.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.191
It's my fault.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.893
Why couldn't I just
leave it alone?

02:40.895 --> 02:42.361
His father died.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.496
The hotel was his legacy.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.898
And I started to doubt him.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.669
(grunts)

02:50.671 --> 02:52.638
I'm tired.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.706
Latin lover narrator:
<i>All leading up to...</i>

02:59.345 --> 03:01.213
This is a mistake.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.815
<i>Or in jane's case...</i>

03:03.817 --> 03:05.484
Jane.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.486
We've been having
some problems, yes,

03:07.488 --> 03:08.921
But we can fix this.

03:08.923 --> 03:12.457
First of all,
what happened last night?

03:12.459 --> 03:14.893
Nothing.
If you call seeing your mother

03:14.895 --> 03:17.529
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>in 27 years nothing.</i>

03:17.531 --> 03:18.630
I don't believe you.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.898
Did I do something?

03:19.900 --> 03:21.533
No.
Then what?

03:21.535 --> 03:22.768
Because you don't just go from

03:22.770 --> 03:24.903
Asking someone to marry you
to breaking up.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.538
That doesn't just happen.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.373
I realized that we were
too different.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.676
We jumped in,
and so much was good,

03:30.678 --> 03:34.479
But long-term...
It just wouldn't work.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.381
How do you know?

03:36.383 --> 03:37.816
Because I was constantly
disappointing you.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.985
And you were having
major doubts, too.

03:39.987 --> 03:43.222
And isn't it better for us
to know now, for our baby?

03:43.224 --> 03:45.924
No, better for the baby
is us together.
Not if we're always fighting.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.759
Then we work on it;
we don't just give up.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.495
Who's getting excited
for a baby shower?!

03:50.497 --> 03:51.797
It's tomorrow;
so much to set up!

03:51.799 --> 03:53.465
Which way to the kitchen?

03:53.467 --> 03:55.467
I'm gonna throw
onesies outside.
Over here, you guys.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.536
Lina: Okay, come on,
I need a picture.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.404
I don't have any pictures
with you together.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.639
Luca:
Smile!

04:00.641 --> 04:02.741
Ah! You guys are
the cutest couple ever.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.942
(camera clicks)

04:12.685 --> 04:15.587
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes, here we are,</i>

04:15.589 --> 04:17.656
<i>With our other cute couple.</i>
<i>Ow! You're hurting me, roman!</i>

04:21.294 --> 04:23.362
Move.

04:24.731 --> 04:27.499
What is this place?
Everglades.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.635
So don't bother screaming,
'cause no one can hear you.

04:32.905 --> 04:35.707
You should know I
killed my brother.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.442
I won't hesitate

04:37.444 --> 04:38.844
To kill you.

04:40.546 --> 04:41.713
(phones ringing)

04:41.715 --> 04:43.949
Still no answer from petra.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.917
I told her to act normal
around roman

04:45.919 --> 04:47.753
Till the fingerprint results
came in.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.388
Look, we have an apb out
on his car.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.490
We're gonna find them.

04:51.492 --> 04:54.826
Rogelio: <i>I'm surprised it hasn't</i>
<i>been all over the news yet.</i>

04:54.828 --> 04:57.763
I don't like to use the term
"triple threat,"

04:57.765 --> 05:01.066
Because it suggests that I'm
limited to only three skills,

05:01.068 --> 05:04.069
But the fact is, in addition
to acting and dancing,

05:04.071 --> 05:05.871
I'm a rather phenomenal singer.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.040
And now, at last,

05:08.042 --> 05:10.575
I have been offered
a las vegas residency.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.044
Like britney spears.

05:12.046 --> 05:13.545
Though mine is only
for one night.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.047
Well, congratulations.

05:15.049 --> 05:17.482
And to you, too, xiomara.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.384
Because I told them
I will only do it

05:19.386 --> 05:20.519
If you open for me,

05:20.521 --> 05:22.054
And they agreed.

05:22.056 --> 05:24.423
And they have arranged
a photo shoot for us.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.091
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You may wonder why xiomara</i>

05:26.093 --> 05:27.893
<i>Isn't jumping for joy.</i>

05:27.895 --> 05:29.961
<i>Well, remember this?</i>

05:32.865 --> 05:35.967
<i>So she was pretty much</i>
<i>wracked with guilt.</i>

05:35.969 --> 05:38.503
Xiomara, why are you not
jumping for joy?

05:39.605 --> 05:41.073
I just...

05:41.075 --> 05:45.010
I can't believe
you did this for me.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.912
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Also in disbelief...</i>

05:46.914 --> 05:48.980
Jane:
<i>Am I being practical or brave?</i>

05:48.982 --> 05:51.583
Rafael:
<i>Be brave.</i>

05:57.423 --> 05:59.758
â™ª

06:05.431 --> 06:07.065
(laughter)

06:08.434 --> 06:09.601
(screams)
oh!

06:10.136 --> 06:12.037
Oh, god!

06:24.450 --> 06:26.885
â™ª

06:29.021 --> 06:30.856
Lina:
Jane?

06:30.858 --> 06:33.024
Huh?
You know how I'm
a little psychic?

06:33.026 --> 06:34.726
I can't agree with that.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.696
Anyway, I'm pretty sure
I sensed something wrong

06:37.698 --> 06:39.498
Between you and
rafael upstairs.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.401
Dude, you guys okay?

06:42.403 --> 06:44.403
I don't know.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.971
I mean, we've been
having problems,

06:45.973 --> 06:48.039
But last night,
he just kind of freaked out.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.142
Okay, I don't know if this
has anything to do with it,

06:50.144 --> 06:51.543
But I did see him having

06:51.545 --> 06:53.678
A super intense conversation
last night.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.846
With who?

06:54.848 --> 06:56.415
A woman, older.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.750
Jane:
<i>What time was it at?</i>

06:58.752 --> 07:00.886
7:00, 7:30?

07:03.122 --> 07:04.089
Oh, my god.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.891
Elena di nola?

07:05.893 --> 07:07.092
Who's that?

07:07.094 --> 07:08.560
His mother.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.562
This is what must have happened.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.164
It had to do
with his mother.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.632
Something bad must
have happened to her,

07:13.634 --> 07:14.966
And now he's
pushing you away!

07:14.968 --> 07:16.902
Don't throw in the towel.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.670
He's pulling away
because he's hurt,

07:18.672 --> 07:20.839
But now that you know what's
going on, you can fix this.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.008
Fight for our love, jane.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.476
Fight for our love.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.811
I will.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.078
Hmm?

07:27.080 --> 07:29.514
I have to talk to rafael.

07:35.688 --> 07:37.022
(knocking)

07:37.024 --> 07:38.824
Can I come in?

07:38.826 --> 07:40.225
Yeah, yeah, of course.

07:41.928 --> 07:44.463
Why didn't you tell me
you saw your mom last night?

07:44.465 --> 07:46.698
Lina saw you
with someone,

07:46.700 --> 07:48.500
And I checked the receipts.

07:48.502 --> 07:49.968
I would've been there for you.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.937
I know.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.840
Sh-she got my e-mail and came.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.943
Said she wanted to talk
about what happened,

07:57.945 --> 07:59.845
Why she left,
so that I could decide

07:59.847 --> 08:02.047
Whether or not I wanted to have
a relationship with her.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.548
And what'd she say?

08:03.550 --> 08:05.851
That she took
ten million dollars

08:05.853 --> 08:08.186
From my father to leave
and never see me again.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.490
I'm so sorry.
Jane, wait.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.892
I know that you think
that that's why I'm doing this,

08:13.894 --> 08:14.893
That they're somehow related.

08:14.895 --> 08:17.195
They are.
But they're not.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.664
And that's why
I didn't tell you.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.234
Look, this is about the fact
that we want different things,

08:22.236 --> 08:24.936
And that I am
constantly disappointing you.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.771
Rafael, stop.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.573
I love you.

08:28.575 --> 08:29.841
Do you still

08:29.843 --> 08:31.843
Love me?

08:33.813 --> 08:35.113
Yes.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.582
But that doesn't mean
that I can make you happy.

08:37.584 --> 08:39.017
Or that we should be together.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.653
No, but it means that
we can work on it.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.954
Please,

08:42.956 --> 08:45.924
Don't just walk away.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.760
Work on it how?

08:48.762 --> 08:51.296
Maybe couple's therapy.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.998
I know people that swear by it.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.800
I'll find someone great.

08:55.802 --> 08:59.304
I'll drop the solano name
if I have to.

08:59.306 --> 09:02.073
Please?

09:02.075 --> 09:03.675
Sure, I'll hold.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.548
She has a cancellation?

09:09.550 --> 09:11.016
That's amazing.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.250
Yes, perfect.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.952
We'll be there.
Where you going?

09:13.954 --> 09:15.854
Couple's therapist

09:15.856 --> 09:18.056
With rafael.
Seriously?

09:18.058 --> 09:20.091
Yeah, I mean,
I don't know what else to do.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.226
I hope it helps.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.061
(sighs)
so, hey,

09:23.063 --> 09:25.764
If you have, like, five minutes
at the end of your session

09:25.766 --> 09:27.566
To ask, like,
a little question for me.

09:27.568 --> 09:28.800
What's going on?

09:29.936 --> 09:31.903
I-I kissed marco last night.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.105
You did what?
I know, I know, I know.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.774
What is the matter with you?

09:35.776 --> 09:37.175
Wh-why would you do that?

09:37.177 --> 09:39.277
Ugh, rogelio's mom was being
so mean to me,

09:39.279 --> 09:41.112
And I thought that
he was gonna listen to her

09:41.114 --> 09:42.948
And break up with me, so I...
Self-sabotaged?

09:42.950 --> 09:44.783
Why?

09:44.785 --> 09:45.917
Why do that?

09:45.919 --> 09:46.918
I don't know.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.788
It was stupid.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.623
I know
what you're gonna say.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.224
I have to tell him, right?

09:53.226 --> 09:55.594
I don't know.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.762
I mean, normally,
I would say yes,

09:57.764 --> 10:00.265
But this is rogelio
we're talking about.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.933
He's a very proud man

10:01.935 --> 10:03.635
With a very
healthy ego.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.637
So you're saying don't tell him?

10:05.639 --> 10:07.906
I'm saying I don't know.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.274
And I'm gonna make
a therapy appointment for you.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.910
Apparently,
she's very good.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.979
She's got, like, seven letters
after her name.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.047
It's nice to meet you.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.854
Thanks for
squeezing us in.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.122
Of course.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.991
So why don't you give me
a little backstory.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.959
Your relationship in a nutshell.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.160
Should I?

10:29.162 --> 10:30.395
Yeah, why don't you.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.997
Okay. Um...

10:31.999 --> 10:33.632
Well, for starters,

10:33.634 --> 10:35.634
I was accidentally
artificially inseminated

10:35.636 --> 10:36.768
With rafael's sperm.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.836
(chuckles):
Oh.

10:38.772 --> 10:41.072
But we had met five
years before that.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.240
My sister

10:42.242 --> 10:43.775
Was the inseminator.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.710
I'm a virgin, actually.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.145
Boop. (chuckles)

10:47.147 --> 10:49.147
And then my ex-wife
punched herself in the face

10:49.149 --> 10:50.715
So she could
have me arrested.

10:50.717 --> 10:53.351
And then my
ex-fiancÃ© found

10:53.353 --> 10:56.187
Secret plastic surgery
tunnels in his hotel.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.355
And then my father
was murdered.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.890
My father turned
out to be

10:58.892 --> 11:00.025
The guy from <i>the</i>
<i>passions of santos.</i>

11:00.027 --> 11:01.793
And my father's killer
ended up being

11:01.795 --> 11:02.794
My stepmother,

11:02.796 --> 11:03.795
Sin rostro.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.864
So that's us.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.265
In a nutshell.
(chuckles)

11:07.267 --> 11:08.933
But we actually were
coming here

11:08.935 --> 11:10.802
Because we have, like,
normal couple bumps,

11:10.804 --> 11:12.337
Which we wanted
to talk to you about.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.105
So what's been going on?

11:16.275 --> 11:18.276
Well...

11:18.278 --> 11:21.279
We're very different.

11:21.281 --> 11:24.916
And we grew up
very differently.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.918
And I think that we're
just having trouble

11:26.920 --> 11:28.353
Navigating
through that.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.188
But we love
each other.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.956
And we want
to fix this.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.191
Mmm.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.093
Do you?
Do I love her?

11:35.095 --> 11:36.428
Yes.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.830
Want to fix this.

11:43.169 --> 11:46.037
I just don't know if these are
things that can be fixed.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.907
Barbara:
Well, let's dive in.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.909
So what's the plan?

11:50.911 --> 11:52.110
Sin rostro's gone
underground,

11:52.112 --> 11:53.745
So I'm gonna run
things from cuba.

11:53.747 --> 11:54.946
They're flailing
down there.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.214
They need someone
to step in.

11:58.784 --> 11:59.984
She'll come after you.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.286
(chuckles)
let her try.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.288
I've got all her contacts now

12:03.290 --> 12:05.356
And a lot of angry guys
who were cut out

12:05.358 --> 12:08.359
When she started
this plastic surgery crap.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.829
Well, it sounds like you got it
all planned out, roman.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.464
Latin lover narrator: <i>Down</i>
<i>to killing his twin brother</i>

12:12.466 --> 12:14.299
In order to fake his own death.

12:20.172 --> 12:22.240
Take me with you.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.243
Come on, I know
you want to.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.479
You got the flash drive back
weeks ago;

12:27.481 --> 12:29.013
Why else did you stay?

12:29.015 --> 12:30.115
I was evaluating my options.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.117
(scoffs)

12:32.119 --> 12:33.952
Come on, we want the
same things out of life.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.787
You know that.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.422
Money.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.491
Lots and lots
of money.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.528
The kind of money
you're talking about.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.530
Wow.

12:45.532 --> 12:49.134
So you're not gonna even try and
pretend to be in love with me.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.935
You'd know
I was lying.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.170
(chuckles)

12:52.172 --> 12:54.239
'cause you know me.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.242
Just like I know you.

12:57.244 --> 13:00.245
And I knew it was you from
the moment you kissed me

13:00.247 --> 13:02.380
As aaron.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.165
Well, it sounds like there's
definitely a lot of love.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.200
You support
each other's dreams.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.202
You're both committed
to being good parents,

13:24.204 --> 13:27.272
Although your ideas of that
might be different.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.873
Good job!

13:28.875 --> 13:30.275
This was a great idea!

13:31.343 --> 13:34.212
I'm so proud of us
for coming here.

13:34.214 --> 13:37.015
Barbara: At the same time,
you do have some differences,

13:37.017 --> 13:38.817
And they are not small ones,

13:38.819 --> 13:41.486
Which means you're both going to
have to be willing to make

13:41.488 --> 13:43.254
Some big compromises.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.856
So think about that.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.491
Unfortunately,
we're out of time.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.226
But I'm going to give
you some exercises

13:48.228 --> 13:50.195
That help with intimacy,
communication,

13:50.197 --> 13:52.263
Reconnecting.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.999
Great, fantastic!
I'm great at tests.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.001
Barbara: Although I am
sensing some reluctance

13:57.003 --> 13:59.003
From you, rafael.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.005
When she said "exercises,"
I thought she meant this.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.440
(both giggle)

14:02.442 --> 14:05.910
Barbara: And your reluctance
would make sense, hmm?

14:05.912 --> 14:08.279
After everything you've
been through-- a divorce,

14:08.281 --> 14:10.481
The death
of your father,

14:10.483 --> 14:12.317
The traumatic meeting
with your mother--

14:12.319 --> 14:14.319
You might not be
emotionally available

14:14.321 --> 14:16.354
To give jane what she needs.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.455
Yes, exactly.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.157
That's what I've been
trying to say.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.226
Who is this quack?!
We need
a new therapist.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.595
Barbara:
So the question becomes:

14:23.597 --> 14:25.263
Are you willing to do the work?

14:25.265 --> 14:27.265
Tell him he has to.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.067
And only you can answer that.

14:31.237 --> 14:33.238
(ringtone plays)

14:33.240 --> 14:34.939
Andie, hey.

14:34.941 --> 14:35.940
Andie:
Hey.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.575
Been trying to reach you.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.410
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You remember andie, right?</i>

14:39.412 --> 14:42.313
<i>Used to date michael,</i>
<i>used to stalk jane.</i>

14:42.315 --> 14:44.015
Yeah, it's been crazy today.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.117
I-I'm sorry that
I had to cancel tonight.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.253
Oh, no, I understand.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.587
Everything okay?

14:49.589 --> 14:51.122
Yes, I think.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.458
I like you, that's all.

14:53.460 --> 14:57.061
So I just wanted to check in
before this goes any further.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.063
Are we having an official talk?

14:59.065 --> 15:00.298
So soon?

15:00.300 --> 15:01.900
I know. I know it's too soon.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.234
It just doesn't feel
like it's too soon

15:03.236 --> 15:05.536
Because of our history.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.372
Officially, I like you, too.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.240
In fact, I...

15:09.242 --> 15:12.443
I even told my parents,
a few friends, jane...

15:12.445 --> 15:14.045
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

15:14.047 --> 15:15.046
What?

15:15.048 --> 15:17.048
My ex, I ran into her.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.983
Um, recently?

15:18.985 --> 15:20.585
Hey, we got a tip
on roman's car.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.087
Hey, listen, uh,
I got to go, okay?

15:23.089 --> 15:24.422
I'll call you later.
Uh...

15:24.424 --> 15:26.357
He was spotted northbound
on the tamiami trail.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.927
It's one of only two roads that
cuts through the everglades.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.061
So that's where
he's headed, then.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.329
Yep.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.998
Let's go.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Latin lover narrator: <i>You know</i>
<i>where you don't want to go</i>

15:36.002 --> 15:38.002
<i>After you've spent</i>
<i>an emotionally</i>

15:38.004 --> 15:40.071
<i>And financially draining hour</i>
<i>dissecting your relationship?</i>

15:41.607 --> 15:43.608
Hi! Hey!

15:43.610 --> 15:46.611
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Yep, this is pretty much it.</i>

15:46.613 --> 15:48.246
Yay, you're here!

15:48.248 --> 15:49.314
Hey.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.450
This is great.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.452
(chatter continues)

15:54.454 --> 15:56.354
Mama.

15:57.723 --> 15:59.557
Come.
Wow.

16:02.227 --> 16:04.662
Lena, why is my romance
writer's group here?

16:04.664 --> 16:07.265
I asked if I should invite
them, and you said, "yeah."

16:07.267 --> 16:09.267
I said, "yeah."

16:09.269 --> 16:11.235
Oh, sorry, my bad.

16:11.237 --> 16:12.337
Hello, jane.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.005
Hey.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.341
We're so touched
you invited us.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.742
Oh, of course, how could I not?

16:17.744 --> 16:19.210
Oh, look, even phil's here.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.478
Hey, phil.

16:23.082 --> 16:25.083
What are you
doing here?

16:25.085 --> 16:26.317
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

16:26.319 --> 16:28.286
Hey, can we talk real quick?

16:35.327 --> 16:38.363
So... You know.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.764
That you stalked me.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.432
And are apparently
still stalking me.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.034
I didn't mean to.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.303
I saw on facebook that
you and michael broke up,

16:45.305 --> 16:48.306
And I had a mutual friend
sort of feel him out.

16:48.308 --> 16:51.409
And she said he was
still hung up on you.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.077
I was curious.

16:53.079 --> 16:54.245
Lina:
Jane?

16:54.247 --> 16:55.513
Get in here.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.383
I have to ask.

16:58.385 --> 17:02.186
Would you maybe consider
not telling michael?

17:08.527 --> 17:11.362
Okay, so we are going to
officially kick off the shower

17:11.364 --> 17:13.431
With a very special
performance.

17:13.433 --> 17:16.501
â™ª

17:18.137 --> 17:19.537
Jane.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.340
Please accept
my gift to you,

17:22.342 --> 17:24.542
The gift of music.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.779
This is a preview of a song
you will be hearing very soon

17:27.781 --> 17:30.381
At my one-night-only
las vegas residency.

17:30.383 --> 17:34.552
A song that my grandchild
will hear at bedtime.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.623
â™ª

18:19.498 --> 18:22.100
That's for tampa.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.535
Latin lover narrator: <i>Well, that</i>
<i>certainly livened things up.</i>

18:29.842 --> 18:31.809
Jane, I am so sorry,
truly. I-I'm just...

18:31.811 --> 18:33.811
No, it's okay.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.446
But how do you know my father?

18:35.448 --> 18:36.848
How do you know
jane's writing teacher?

18:36.850 --> 18:38.249
Amanda:
<i>A few years ago,</i>

18:38.251 --> 18:40.885
We were developing a...

18:40.887 --> 18:42.887
Screen adaptation of
<i>love under the bridge,</i>

18:42.889 --> 18:44.589
And he was interested
in the lead.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.592
We were on a couch,
talking about casting,

18:47.594 --> 18:50.528
So I assumed it was a
casting couch situation.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.662
We fell for each other.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.897
We slept with each other.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.632
Uh, but he didn't
get the role.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.234
And I didn't get the
role. I didn't realize

18:56.236 --> 18:57.768
That sleeping with a
writer was pointless.

18:57.770 --> 19:01.305
So he never showed up for our
romantic getaway in tampa.

19:01.307 --> 19:04.475
I didn't go to tampa, but it
seems she still holds a grudge.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.444
Of course, I still
hold a grudge.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.212
You need to apologize right now.

19:08.214 --> 19:10.214
Okay, I sent her
a rogelio gift basket,

19:10.216 --> 19:12.517
And I included two varieties
of smoked meats.

19:12.519 --> 19:13.684
Please, dad.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.353
It's my writing teacher.

19:17.623 --> 19:21.626
So I wanted to make
a little toast to jane.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.295
Most of you know, but
for those that don't,

19:24.297 --> 19:26.697
Jane and I met
in the fifth grade

19:26.699 --> 19:28.633
When I hijacked
her sex ed lesson.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.468
(quiet laughter)

19:30.470 --> 19:31.669
Anyway,

19:31.671 --> 19:33.938
I don't like all
that sappy stuff,

19:33.940 --> 19:37.742
But I was just
thinking about it,

19:37.744 --> 19:40.578
And that's just
a really lucky baby

19:40.580 --> 19:41.946
To get you as a mom.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.681
(partygoers aahing)

19:45.484 --> 19:47.485
Uh, anyway, that's it.

19:47.487 --> 19:51.489
Don't forget to put your guesses
for the birth date in the jar.

19:51.491 --> 19:52.790
All right.

19:54.726 --> 19:56.727
Thank you.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.629
For all of this.
Of course.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.698
And I'm so winning the
birth date lottery.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.668
Guessed may 25, a week
before your due date.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.203
Am I right?

20:05.205 --> 20:06.604
Well, I mean, I'm not sure yet.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.672
Really?

20:07.674 --> 20:09.707
When my sisters
get c-sections,

20:09.709 --> 20:10.875
They schedule it
a week before.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.211
I wasn't gonna
have one.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.645
What?

20:14.647 --> 20:16.647
You're gonna lose your
virginity to your baby?

20:16.649 --> 20:18.449
Well, I wasn't thinking
about it like that.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.717
Well, you should!

20:22.788 --> 20:24.855
(crickets chirping)

20:38.870 --> 20:40.938
(sighs softly)

21:01.460 --> 21:03.594
(floor creaks)

21:12.771 --> 21:14.639
Hello.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.374
My name's petra solano.
I've been kidnapped.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.709
I'm being held in the everglades
near mile marker 42.

21:18.711 --> 21:21.579
Please tell detective michael
cordero from the miami...

21:21.581 --> 21:23.881
(screams)

21:25.017 --> 21:27.551
Woman (over radio):
By mile 42 she said.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.553
We're on it.
Call for backup.

21:29.555 --> 21:31.589
(tires screech)

21:33.725 --> 21:36.694
Roman... Please...

21:36.696 --> 21:38.429
You bitch.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.998
(grunts)

21:41.000 --> 21:43.701
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Run, petra! Run!</i>

21:43.703 --> 21:45.469
(petra gasps)

21:56.682 --> 21:58.482
Petra!

22:00.052 --> 22:02.753
It's over, petra.

22:04.690 --> 22:06.924
Where'd you go?

22:06.926 --> 22:09.060
Back here?
(branches rustle)

22:09.062 --> 22:10.861
(roman laughs)

22:11.830 --> 22:15.032
Petra...

22:21.940 --> 22:24.008
(branches rustle)

22:46.665 --> 22:48.666
Petra?

22:48.668 --> 22:49.900
(screams)
it's okay, it's okay.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.135
You're safe.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.803
We're gonna take you back.
It's okay.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.572
It's all right. It's okay.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.774
(whimpers)

22:59.745 --> 23:01.912
Yeah. I'm pretty showered out.

23:01.914 --> 23:04.782
Want to gently suggest
to lina that we call it?

23:04.784 --> 23:06.751
Oh, she's waiting for
rafael to show up

23:06.753 --> 23:08.052
With the flowers
and stuff.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.787
Mom, we're not
in a great place.

23:09.789 --> 23:10.921
I-I just...
I don't think...

23:10.923 --> 23:12.423
Lina:
Look who's here!

23:12.425 --> 23:15.159
(excited chatter)

23:22.467 --> 23:23.968
Okay, one more activity.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.970
I didn't know if you were...
No.

23:25.972 --> 23:27.405
Of course I'd be here.
Lina: Okay.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.973
So, jane and rafael

23:28.975 --> 23:31.075
Filled these out
a few weeks ago.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.744
Let's see how they did.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.813
What song is
rafael excited

23:35.815 --> 23:37.948
To play for the baby?

23:37.950 --> 23:39.950
(singing in spanish)
jane: Dad!

23:39.952 --> 23:41.419
No, no.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.820
Bon jovi's
"living on a prayer."

23:42.822 --> 23:44.755
Rafael,

23:44.757 --> 23:48.159
What does jane want the baby's
first word to be?

23:51.696 --> 23:53.731
Uh, "abuela"?
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Kiss-ass.</i>

23:56.701 --> 23:58.436
Yeah, but I'll
be abuela now.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.537
Lina:
Jane?

24:00.872 --> 24:04.008
It's "daddy" actually.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.876
(partygoers aahing)

24:05.878 --> 24:07.912
Okay.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.548
Jane, what traits
do you think rafael wants

24:10.550 --> 24:12.550
The baby to get from you?

24:12.552 --> 24:14.552
My taste in music clearly.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.854
(laughter)

24:16.856 --> 24:20.591
My professional level capacity
for organization?

24:20.593 --> 24:21.992
Rafael?

24:21.994 --> 24:25.796
Uh... Everything.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.099
The more jane the better.

24:29.101 --> 24:33.037
There's nothing
I don't love about her.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.872
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And hearing his own words</i>

24:34.874 --> 24:37.942
<i>Reminded him how much he did.</i>

24:37.944 --> 24:40.211
Let's try at least.

24:40.213 --> 24:41.545
Yeah?

24:41.547 --> 24:43.814
Yeah.

24:43.816 --> 24:44.882
(chuckles)

24:44.884 --> 24:46.250
Break out those exercises, huh?

24:49.955 --> 24:51.555
We're gonna get
you checked out,

24:51.557 --> 24:54.124
And then we're gonna
take you home, okay?

24:54.126 --> 24:57.061
Michael:
Nadine.

24:57.063 --> 24:59.730
Look at this.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.899
Flash drive.

25:03.268 --> 25:04.902
Maybe the other one was a decoy.

25:06.671 --> 25:09.640
I just wanted to say
that I'm truly sorry

25:09.642 --> 25:11.909
For not making love
to you in tampa.

25:11.911 --> 25:14.044
Thank you for saying that.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.646
You're so very welcome.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.715
So, uh, we'll just move on

25:17.717 --> 25:21.018
And, uh, chalk it up
to youthful indiscretions.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.687
Yes. Although we-we
shouldn't use the word

25:23.689 --> 25:26.056
"youthful" when
retelling the story.

25:26.058 --> 25:29.059
Then people might think
we are not youthful now.

25:29.061 --> 25:31.228
Oh, rogelio.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.097
(laughs)

25:33.099 --> 25:36.200
May I say that you are still
as charming as I remember you?

25:36.202 --> 25:37.935
You may.

25:37.937 --> 25:40.971
Oh, time has been
very kind to you.

25:40.973 --> 25:44.008
Well, I moisturize
seven times a day, so..

25:44.010 --> 25:46.043
Oh.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.546
Amanda, I'm sorry if I gave
you the wrong impression,

25:48.548 --> 25:50.014
But I am officially
a taken man.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.550
And I will not
be led astray.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.919
I see.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.787
Nadine:
<i>All right, well,</i>

25:56.789 --> 25:59.089
Let me know if they make any
progress with the flash drive.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.625
Yeah, I'm hearing tomorrow,
the earliest.

26:01.627 --> 26:04.128
Hey.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.763
Is this a bad time?

26:05.765 --> 26:07.097
I was just
heading out actually.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.098
I'll see you later.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.000
What a nice surprise.

26:12.137 --> 26:13.671
So, um...

26:13.673 --> 26:16.707
I have to tell you something.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.742
It's about jane.

26:20.011 --> 26:22.947
So it's kind of just
a staring contest?

26:22.949 --> 26:24.982
It's not a contest.
It's an exercise.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.083
Three minutes, no talking.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.651
You ready?

26:27.653 --> 26:28.986
'cause I'm gonna crush this.

26:28.988 --> 26:31.055
Even though it's not a contest?

26:31.057 --> 26:33.357
I'm just saying, I'm bringing
my "a" game-- you ready?

26:33.359 --> 26:34.725
I'm ready.

26:34.727 --> 26:35.993
Okay.

26:35.995 --> 26:38.028
Starting...

26:38.030 --> 26:40.097
Now.

27:04.089 --> 27:05.956
Should we stop and just
try another exercise?

27:05.958 --> 27:07.224
That's a great idea.
Okay.

27:07.226 --> 27:10.027
Let's see. Um...

27:10.029 --> 27:12.363
Here's a list of
spontaneous activities

27:12.365 --> 27:14.798
To help foster intimacy.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.734
But doesn't a list
of spontaneous activities

27:16.736 --> 27:18.002
Kind of defeat the purpose?

27:18.004 --> 27:20.104
Yes.

27:20.106 --> 27:21.105
Screw the list.

27:21.107 --> 27:22.673
Let's go rogue.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.408
What are you thinking?

27:24.410 --> 27:26.110
Skinny dipping.

27:26.112 --> 27:28.045
(laughs)

27:28.047 --> 27:29.313
What?

27:29.315 --> 27:31.949
Come on, you wouldn't.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.318
I have. Twice.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.653
In public?

27:35.655 --> 27:37.821
No.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.024
But I'm about to.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.393
(quietly):
Are you...?

27:42.395 --> 27:45.729
Are you serious?

28:01.246 --> 28:02.680
(both laugh)

28:02.682 --> 28:04.148
You like that, huh?

28:04.883 --> 28:06.183
Whoa! What?

28:06.185 --> 28:08.318
There is no splashing
in the pool.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.354
That is hotel rules.
There's a sign right there.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.722
Is that so?

28:11.724 --> 28:14.224
Yeah.
Yeah?

28:14.226 --> 28:16.293
Yeah.

28:34.913 --> 28:37.414
God, I missed you.

28:37.416 --> 28:38.782
Me, too.

28:38.784 --> 28:41.251
So much.

28:41.253 --> 28:44.354
I love you.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.356
I love you.

29:07.212 --> 29:10.481
So maybe now
it's the time.

29:10.483 --> 29:12.282
"the time"?

29:12.284 --> 29:14.151
Yes.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.186
Let's have sex.

29:16.188 --> 29:17.821
Wait, what?

29:17.823 --> 29:19.022
We're having a baby.

29:19.024 --> 29:20.390
And I love you.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.059
Let's do it.

29:22.061 --> 29:25.362
I want to.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.164
Are you sure?

29:27.166 --> 29:29.233
I am.

29:31.336 --> 29:34.438
Okay. Okay.

29:40.111 --> 29:42.212
Man:
Hey, the pool area is closed!

29:42.214 --> 29:43.914
Oh, uh, sorry, mr. Solano.

29:43.916 --> 29:46.216
I didn't know it was you.
Hey, nick.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.251
I'm gonna...
We were just, uh...

29:47.253 --> 29:49.086
I'm... Sorry.

29:58.296 --> 30:00.531
And you almost had sex?

30:00.533 --> 30:02.366
Yes. I would've.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.535
Another minute... Oh.

30:04.537 --> 30:06.537
Well, what happened
after the guard left?

30:06.539 --> 30:08.272
I don't know.
The moment was over.

30:08.274 --> 30:10.340
Just kind of said I should go

30:10.342 --> 30:12.576
And I would talk
to him tomorrow.

30:12.578 --> 30:15.212
Honey, what were
you thinking?

30:15.214 --> 30:16.446
I don't know.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.248
It was a combination of things.

30:18.250 --> 30:21.318
I mean, definitely the moment.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.822
But... It would
be nice to have sex

30:24.824 --> 30:27.324
Before the baby comes, right?

30:27.326 --> 30:29.960
And the therapist did
talk about compromise.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.329
Well, honey, you can't
compromise who you are.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.264
A virgin is not who I am.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.166
But it's
important to you.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.068
So is rafael.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.970
I love him.

30:39.972 --> 30:43.307
I want it to work.

30:43.309 --> 30:46.176
And you think having sex
with him will make it work?

30:46.178 --> 30:48.178
What's your problem?

30:48.180 --> 30:50.280
You have been bugging me
to lose it for years.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.615
Ah.

30:51.617 --> 30:54.251
You waited this long.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.486
(sighs)

30:58.156 --> 31:00.324
No.

31:00.326 --> 31:03.493
Having sex with rafael
wouldn't change anything.

31:03.495 --> 31:06.864
Or solve any of our problems.

31:06.866 --> 31:11.134
So, maybe think of the kind
of compromise that would.

31:13.638 --> 31:15.505
Michael:
How much longer?

31:15.507 --> 31:17.107
Stop asking me.

31:17.109 --> 31:18.308
Right. Okay.

31:18.310 --> 31:21.245
I am sorry.

31:21.247 --> 31:23.413
Roman must've given us the other
flash drive to set us up.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.449
This is the real deal.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.217
I can feel it.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.486
And...

31:29.488 --> 31:31.555
Here you go.

31:33.658 --> 31:36.093
Michael:
This must be it.

31:36.095 --> 31:38.562
Sin rostro's whole network.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.397
Look at this.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.432
These are known
drug distributors.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.234
Sounds like you hit
the mother lode.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.469
Thank you.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.437
Yep. No problem.

32:01.686 --> 32:03.954
Michael:
Nadine!

32:05.623 --> 32:08.358
Hey. I heard they're
getting closer down there.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.626
Any progress?

32:09.628 --> 32:11.161
You were working for her?

32:11.163 --> 32:12.329
What?

32:12.331 --> 32:13.597
Your name was on the list.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.065
Were you working for sin rostro?

32:15.067 --> 32:16.500
Yes.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.001
But you have
to understand,

32:18.003 --> 32:19.369
She-she was
threatening to kill

32:19.371 --> 32:21.038
My family;
she knew where they lived.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.507
You were working against me.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.509
All this time, huh?

32:25.511 --> 32:27.611
We haven't heard from sin rostro
in four years because he's dead.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.379
It was clearly
a crime of passion,

32:29.381 --> 32:32.449
Which is why we need to bring
petra solano in for questioning.

32:32.451 --> 32:33.684
I don't want to tell the captain
about the drug shipment

32:33.686 --> 32:36.253
Until after we make the bust.

32:36.255 --> 32:38.488
Did you know who she was?!
No!

32:38.490 --> 32:39.723
I just tipped off her people

32:39.725 --> 32:41.491
As to where we were
in the investigation.

32:41.493 --> 32:42.726
Who? Who did you tip off?

32:42.728 --> 32:44.094
The bellboy.

32:44.096 --> 32:46.430
<i>And then she killed him,</i>
<i>michael.</i>

32:46.432 --> 32:48.065
(crying):
And there were so many times

32:48.067 --> 32:49.666
That I wanted
to tell you, but...

32:49.668 --> 32:51.268
I couldn't.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.403
Oh, my god.

32:54.672 --> 32:56.606
I have to tell armstrong.

33:01.112 --> 33:03.480
Lot of names
on that list though.

33:05.183 --> 33:08.485
Probably take me an hour
to find yours.

33:10.421 --> 33:12.489
Two, tops.

33:19.097 --> 33:21.331
Xiomara, you look spectacular.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.000
Very de la vegas, baby.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.634
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, they must be getting ready</i>

33:24.636 --> 33:26.370
<i>For the big photo shoot.</i>

33:26.372 --> 33:28.038
Really? You don't
think it's too big?

33:28.040 --> 33:29.373
No.

33:29.375 --> 33:30.707
Are you okay?

33:32.510 --> 33:34.678
Not really.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.414
My pores are closely connected
to my emotions--

33:37.416 --> 33:39.583
When one is clogged,
the other is clogged.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.451
What are you talking about?

33:41.453 --> 33:42.652
I need to tell you something.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.521
It's been eating me up inside,

33:44.523 --> 33:46.356
And I won't be camera ready
until I get it out.

33:46.358 --> 33:47.657
What's going on?

33:47.659 --> 33:49.026
Amanda kissed me.

33:49.028 --> 33:51.061
I didn't kiss her back,
but I should have

33:51.063 --> 33:52.696
Known better than to put myself
in a situation

33:52.698 --> 33:54.331
With a woman
who cannot resist me.

33:54.333 --> 33:56.299
Oh. No problem.

33:56.301 --> 33:58.301
Really?
It happens.

33:58.303 --> 34:00.504
I forgive you.
A kiss is nothing anyway.

34:00.506 --> 34:03.073
Of course!
It was nothing.

34:03.075 --> 34:04.608
I mean, if the shoe
were on the other foot

34:04.610 --> 34:06.543
And-and I were the one
confessing to you,

34:06.545 --> 34:08.445
You would
understand, right?

34:08.447 --> 34:10.447
But of course.
I'm not a monster, xiomara.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.549
Okay, well...

34:12.551 --> 34:13.784
Assistant:
It's time!

34:13.786 --> 34:15.452
We need you on set right now.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.154
Great!
Let's do this!

34:22.593 --> 34:24.061
(clears throat)

34:24.063 --> 34:25.295
(line ringing)

34:25.297 --> 34:26.630
Hello?

34:26.632 --> 34:27.697
Petra:
Rafael.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.599
Hi.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.268
Look, I-I, uh...

34:31.270 --> 34:33.136
I don't know if-if you heard
about what happened.

34:33.138 --> 34:34.271
Uh, no, I didn't.
But listen,

34:34.273 --> 34:35.472
Uh, jane just got here,

34:35.474 --> 34:36.606
So can I call you back?

34:36.608 --> 34:38.542
Yeah, sure.

34:38.544 --> 34:39.843
Okay.

34:48.619 --> 34:50.420
(sighs)

34:50.422 --> 34:51.721
(sniffles)

34:54.592 --> 34:57.294
Mother?

34:57.296 --> 34:59.362
It's me.

34:59.364 --> 35:01.731
So, can we talk?

35:01.733 --> 35:03.366
Yeah.

35:03.368 --> 35:04.634
Yeah, let's talk.

35:04.636 --> 35:07.204
Last night...

35:07.206 --> 35:09.506
What happened,
or almost happened,

35:09.508 --> 35:12.175
I don't think
it's the right move, for me.

35:12.177 --> 35:13.643
I agree.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.212
Because it's not about sex.

35:15.214 --> 35:16.746
I mean,
that wouldn't change anything.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.682
But I was thinking
about what the therapist said

35:18.684 --> 35:21.685
About compromise and meeting
each other halfway, and...

35:21.687 --> 35:23.553
I think we should
move in together.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.288
I mean, it's initially
what you wanted

35:25.290 --> 35:27.124
And it took me a
second to get there,

35:27.126 --> 35:28.391
But it makes sense.

35:28.393 --> 35:29.626
This way, I'm not anxious

35:29.628 --> 35:33.363
Because the time you spend
at home, we'll be together.

35:33.365 --> 35:34.831
Jane...
But that's not even
the reason why.

35:36.267 --> 35:38.535
I genuinely
want to live with you.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.604
To go to bed and wake up...

35:40.606 --> 35:42.372
I can't.

35:42.374 --> 35:43.573
We can't.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.675
Why not?

35:45.677 --> 35:47.377
This is what you wanted.

35:49.780 --> 35:52.649
Look, last night, um...

35:52.651 --> 35:54.784
Got me thinking, too.

35:54.786 --> 35:57.554
And I realized that
something has changed.

36:00.791 --> 36:05.362
I just don't love you
the way that you love me.

36:08.199 --> 36:09.566
That's the problem.

36:09.568 --> 36:11.234
That's why this won't work.

36:11.236 --> 36:12.602
I don't believe you.

36:12.604 --> 36:13.837
Look, I know that

36:13.839 --> 36:15.739
This hurts to hear...

36:15.741 --> 36:17.574
Why are you saying this?
Because I thought
that I did.

36:17.576 --> 36:18.875
But I guess I just got

36:18.877 --> 36:21.845
Caught up in the idea
of us being a family.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.481
Of you being
the mother of my child.

36:24.483 --> 36:25.749
And...

36:25.751 --> 36:29.386
I was just projecting
so much onto that.

36:29.388 --> 36:33.356
But I am seeing things
clearly now.

36:33.358 --> 36:35.659
I think that we should end it.

36:35.661 --> 36:38.495
Focus on
how we can both be

36:38.497 --> 36:40.230
Good parents.

36:40.232 --> 36:41.598
Wow.

36:49.540 --> 36:52.642
I guess I'm seeing things
clearly, too.

37:01.919 --> 37:04.254
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

37:04.256 --> 37:05.722
<i>Holy hell.</i>

37:05.724 --> 37:08.892
<i>That is not the rafael</i>
<i>we have come to know and love.</i>

37:08.894 --> 37:10.493
<i>Why on earth would he do that?</i>

37:10.495 --> 37:11.895
<i>Let me explain.</i>

37:11.897 --> 37:14.631
<i>You see, he went back</i>
<i>to dr. Stanbrook,</i>

37:14.633 --> 37:17.801
<i>Phd, mfcc, this morning.</i>

37:17.803 --> 37:19.436
<i>Alone.</i>

37:19.438 --> 37:21.538
Yes, I love her, okay?
Of course I love her,

37:21.540 --> 37:24.407
But that doesn't change the
fact that we are different.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.610
Different people enter into
relationships all the time.

37:26.612 --> 37:28.912
But I can't give her
what she wants, not right now.

37:28.914 --> 37:29.946
Why not?

37:29.948 --> 37:31.314
Because my life
is falling apart.

37:31.316 --> 37:32.782
Okay?

37:32.784 --> 37:34.751
My dad died,

37:34.753 --> 37:38.421
And because of my screwup,
his hotel might go under.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.423
And, oh.... I just
found out that my mother

37:40.425 --> 37:42.425
Took ten million dollars

37:42.427 --> 37:44.761
To walk away from me
when I was four.

37:44.763 --> 37:45.996
So there's...

37:45.998 --> 37:47.731
There's just a lot.

37:47.733 --> 37:50.333
Yeah. It is a lot.

37:50.335 --> 37:52.469
And you might not be
emotionally available right now.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.371
Is that what
you're saying?

37:54.373 --> 37:55.805
I'm saying I'm in a dark place.

37:55.807 --> 37:58.441
And I don't want
to drag her down with me.

37:58.443 --> 37:59.609
I can't.

37:59.611 --> 38:00.977
What makes you think you would?

38:00.979 --> 38:02.512
Because I almost did.

38:02.514 --> 38:03.647
Last night...

38:03.649 --> 38:07.517
I would have had sex with her.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.519
If that security guard
hadn't walked in,

38:09.521 --> 38:13.290
I would have done it,
even though I... I knew...

38:13.292 --> 38:16.459
I knew how much
that means to her.

38:16.461 --> 38:17.761
(sighs)

38:17.763 --> 38:19.829
And she would have
just regretted it, and...

38:19.831 --> 38:22.632
If we keep going,
somehow, someway,

38:22.634 --> 38:23.700
Things are just
gonna get bad.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.468
This will be cleaner.

38:25.470 --> 38:26.936
This will be better for the kid.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.905
We just need
to focus on our kid.

38:28.907 --> 38:31.408
Well, if you're so sure,
what's the problem?

38:31.410 --> 38:32.742
Jane.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.645
She's gonna hold on.
How do you know?

38:35.647 --> 38:39.683
Because she believes in this
almost magical power of love.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.718
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted that rafael</i>

38:41.720 --> 38:43.520
<i>Really thought</i>
<i>he was doing the right thing--</i>

38:43.522 --> 38:46.856
<i>For jane, for their child.</i>

38:46.858 --> 38:49.626
<i>And it should also be noted</i>

38:49.628 --> 38:52.329
<i>That that didn't make it</i>
<i>any easier.</i>

38:57.101 --> 38:58.635
â™ª

38:58.637 --> 39:00.603
Perfect, mr. De la vega.

39:00.605 --> 39:02.605
Xiomara, can I get
a bigger smile?

39:02.607 --> 39:04.040
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But xiomara was</i>

39:04.042 --> 39:05.608
<i>Having trouble smiling.</i>

39:05.610 --> 39:07.577
<i>Her emotional pores</i>
<i>were clogged, too.</i>

39:07.579 --> 39:09.946
I have something
to tell you, rogelio.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.514
It's important.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.416
Yeah, what is it?

39:13.418 --> 39:15.051
Xiomara?

39:15.053 --> 39:18.021
I kissed marco
the other night.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.524
I was upset about
what happened with your mom,

39:21.526 --> 39:23.126
And I was feeling
vulnerable.

39:23.128 --> 39:25.995
It-it was stupid and
it didn't mean anything to me.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.631
Photographer:
Xiomara, get down.

39:28.633 --> 39:30.900
Ooh, back-to-back.
I love it.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.569
Rogelio, come on.

39:32.571 --> 39:33.703
I forgave you.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.705
Amanda kissed me!
You kissed marco!

39:35.707 --> 39:37.540
It meant nothing to me.

39:37.542 --> 39:38.742
I shouldn't have even told you.

39:38.744 --> 39:40.677
Then you'd be a
cheater and a liar!

39:40.679 --> 39:42.879
Rogelio, please...
I'm sorry, xiomara.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.514
This is something I can
simply not forgive!

39:44.516 --> 39:45.615
Do you have everything
you need, philipe?

39:45.617 --> 39:46.616
I'm good, yeah.

39:46.618 --> 39:47.684
Okay. Then this photo shoot,

39:47.686 --> 39:49.719
Like our relationship, is over!

39:53.758 --> 39:55.458
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

39:55.460 --> 39:58.094
<i>That makes two villanueva</i>
<i>hearts broken today.</i>

39:58.096 --> 40:00.029
Michael:
Jane.
Michael, hi.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.565
You knew.
I can't believe you knew.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.401
What?
About andie.

40:04.403 --> 40:06.469
When I told you about her
the other day, you stood there,

40:06.471 --> 40:08.738
Acting like you had
no idea who she was.

40:08.740 --> 40:12.442
I just...
I didn't know what to say.

40:12.444 --> 40:14.477
Well, how about "michael,
she's in my writer's group."

40:14.479 --> 40:16.012
I couldn't.
Why?

40:16.014 --> 40:18.014
Because you seemed happy.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.650
And I didn't want
to ruin that.

40:20.652 --> 40:21.918
I should have.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.921
I'm sorry, okay?

40:24.923 --> 40:27.457
Jane, what's wrong?

40:27.459 --> 40:30.427
Rafael and I broke up.

40:30.429 --> 40:33.096
Are you okay?

40:33.098 --> 40:36.466
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Which brings us back</i>
<i>to the last stage of grief.</i>

40:37.134 --> 40:38.868
Yeah.

40:38.870 --> 40:41.771
I am, actually.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.573
I have to be.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.442
Better to know now, you know?

40:45.444 --> 40:46.810
Before the baby comes.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.812
In the long run,
it's better to know now.

40:50.648 --> 40:53.516
Anyway, I'm, um...
I'm heading home, so...

40:53.518 --> 40:54.984
Do you need a ride
or anything?

40:54.986 --> 40:56.686
No, thank you.

40:56.688 --> 40:59.122
My grandma's coming to get me.

41:00.491 --> 41:01.825
Okay.

41:04.829 --> 41:07.130
I'll see you later?

41:28.853 --> 41:30.887
Thanks for the ride.

41:34.091 --> 41:35.692
Petra:
Thank you for coming.

41:35.694 --> 41:37.794
You know I'm always
here for you.
