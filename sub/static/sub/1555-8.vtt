I'm giving up any of my boys...

Don't care about
your nickel-and-dime pals,

23:05.616 --> 23:07.148
except one.

23:07.150 --> 23:10.352
Your former driver.

23:10.354 --> 23:12.820
I see.

23:12.822 --> 23:16.858
So you got a job
that requires a wheelman.

23:16.860 --> 23:18.126
Something like that.

23:18.128 --> 23:20.327
Bad news, sweetheart.

23:20.329 --> 23:21.629
Don't know where she is.

23:21.631 --> 23:24.331
So then tell me, Romeo,

23:26.069 --> 23:27.368
[Beeping]

23:29.305 --> 23:31.538
And your pal, Elvis,
standing behind me?

23:31.540 --> 23:34.642
He forgot to load the shotgun,

23:34.644 --> 23:36.076

You crazy bitch!

24:00.502 --> 24:04.537
Let's just get to the point.

24:04.539 --> 24:06.872
You recommended a wheelman...
or should I say a wheelwoman...

You want to lose the other?

24:18.452 --> 24:23.422
Where is the wheelman?

24:23.424 --> 24:25.457
There's a dating app
called Angler.

from this baby.

25:16.008 --> 25:18.342

training weapon, you know?

Looks familiar.

25:20.246 --> 25:22.246
You got a motive?

25:22.248 --> 25:24.814
Theft, maybe.

25:24.816 --> 25:26.917
Guessing our victim
met his CIs here

25:26.919 --> 25:28.185
but no sign of break-in.

25:28.187 --> 25:29.753

25:43.368 --> 25:47.136
Why?
Where are we going?

25:47.138 --> 25:49.506
If Howard is dead,
then the hard copy file

25:49.508 --> 25:50.874
in the safe inside that house

25:50.876 --> 25:52.809
is the only proof I'm a cop.

25:52.811 --> 25:54.377
- Those files are gone.
- What?

25:54.379 --> 25:55.945
Then I have to go back in
and explain who I am.

25:55.947 --> 25:58.814
You can't.

25:58.816 --> 26:00.383
Why not?

26:00.385 --> 26:02.985
Because Howard was shot
with your training weapon.

26:02.987 --> 26:06.789
Not only is your only connection
to the NYPD gone,

26:06.791 --> 26:08.190
but you've been framed.

you're Internal Affairs?

26:24.741 --> 26:27.109
Howard's the only one
who knew about me

26:27.111 --> 26:28.811
and my background.

26:28.813 --> 26:30.612
Your background?

26:30.614 --> 26:33.381
In high school,
I was a runner for a gang.

26:33.383 --> 26:35.784
Where I'm from,
it's not a choice.

26:35.786 --> 26:38.921
Once you're in, it's either
knocked up or locked up.

26:38.923 --> 26:40.087
But you got out.

26:40.089 --> 26:42.490
I got arrested.

26:42.492 --> 26:43.958
The judge said if I attended

26:43.960 --> 26:46.394
a community college,
he'll seal my record.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.630
Got to like judges
who give second chances.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.501
I earned my master's
in Criminal Justice

26:53.503 --> 26:55.303
and got into the academy,

26:55.305 --> 26:57.671
and one week before graduation,

26:57.673 --> 27:00.407
Howard plucked me out.

27:00.409 --> 27:02.609
Fixed it like if I had quit.

27:02.611 --> 27:06.413
He saw my juvie record and knew
I had the perfect background

for the next time someone tried
to infiltrate the academy.

27:09.185 --> 27:11.752
Like Laskey, the Russian mole
who worked for HR.

27:11.754 --> 27:12.986
Exactly.

27:12.988 --> 27:14.788
Then Howard got a tip
from the CI

27:14.790 --> 27:17.424
that a gang was gonna put
a recruit on the inside.

Why no electronic record?

our covers look vulnerable.

nowadays.

Frustrating thing is,
I had him.

Who?

28:09.243 --> 28:10.709
Ortiz, my classmate.

28:10.711 --> 28:11.977
He's the mole.

28:11.979 --> 28:13.145
You sure it's Ortiz?

28:13.147 --> 28:14.746
My gun at the crime scene?

It's not a coincidence.
He offered to clean it for me.

28:17.385 --> 28:21.586
And then I found this...

28:21.588 --> 28:23.388
a receipt from the bodega
across the street

28:23.390 --> 28:25.390
from where The Brotherhood
recruits.

28:25.392 --> 28:28.493
Ortiz used his ATM card.

28:28.495 --> 28:31.696
I'm gonna find Ortiz,
and I'm gonna bring his ass in

28:31.698 --> 28:33.665
'cause that's the only way
that I can prove my innocence.

28:33.667 --> 28:35.400
Hang on a second.

28:35.402 --> 28:37.435
I'll check with RTCC,

28:39.005 --> 28:41.239
[Dialing]

28:41.241 --> 28:44.775
I suppose
I am an RTCC of sorts.

28:44.777 --> 28:47.045
But with less attitude.

28:47.047 --> 28:50.181
I've retrieved Ortiz's number
from Silva's phone contacts.

28:50.183 --> 28:51.715
According to his geo-data,

28:51.717 --> 28:54.217
he returned to the academy
last night after class.

28:54.219 --> 28:55.453
To get Silva's gun.

28:55.455 --> 28:57.054
<i>(Finch)
Not exactly.</i>

28:57.056 --> 28:58.789

his movements

28:58.791 --> 29:00.925
to the Commandant's office.

29:00.927 --> 29:03.360
During the time that Ortiz
was in that office,

29:03.362 --> 29:05.596
someone logged on
to the Commandant's computer

29:05.598 --> 29:07.898
using a brute force
password cracker.

29:07.900 --> 29:11.435
I suspect that Mr. Ortiz
has stolen some files.

29:11.437 --> 29:12.802
Why would Dominic enlist a mole

29:12.804 --> 29:14.704
to steal files
from the police academy?

29:14.706 --> 29:16.073
<i>(Finch)
I'm not sure.</i>

29:16.075 --> 29:18.108
Where's Ortiz now?

29:18.110 --> 29:19.943
<i>He's at
an abandoned schoolhouse</i>

29:19.945 --> 29:21.644

- We'll get him.</i>

29:21.646 --> 29:23.246
I'll look
into the stolen files.

29:23.248 --> 29:25.548
It may shine a light
on Dominic's plans.

29:25.550 --> 29:28.985
But first,
I have an errand to run.

29:28.987 --> 29:30.787
The RTCC tracked Ortiz

29:30.789 --> 29:32.922
to an abandoned school
in Spanish Harlem.

29:32.924 --> 29:34.891
The RTCC worked fast.

29:34.893 --> 29:36.759
Well, they're good
with computers.

29:36.761 --> 29:38.728
Spanish Harlem?
That's Trinitarios territory.

29:38.730 --> 29:40.497
The abandoned school
is their headquarters.

29:40.499 --> 29:42.931
They keep it under heavy guard.
The place is a fortress.

29:42.933 --> 29:45.134
Should make
retrieving Ortiz fun.

29:45.136 --> 29:47.769
I'll head back to the Eighth
and check for updates.

29:47.771 --> 29:51.507
Wait, Riley.
I'm coming.

29:51.509 --> 29:53.242
You're safer staying put.

I knew a cop like you once.

30:40.356 --> 30:43.390
She stood up to corruption.

There's one thing

There's nothing in there
