WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:03.072
Previously on Stargate Atlantis.

00:03.160 --> 00:04.639
The weekly injection
you gave me,

00:04.720 --> 00:07.678
that must have been some kind of drug
to keep my cells from deteriorating.

00:07.760 --> 00:11.116
Listen, we're going to keep working
till we find a cure for this thing.

00:13.440 --> 00:14.429
Jackpot.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.636
It's a booby trap!
We've gotta get out of here now!

00:18.760 --> 00:22.355
Have the combat engineers gear up,
and have Dr. Keller ready her away team.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.476
Listen.
- McKAY: Michael's database.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.471
There's a large chunk of it,
maybe the whole thing.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.471
McKAY: We'd have him on the run.
He'd be finished!

00:28.560 --> 00:31.996
Effective immediately,
you are being removed from command.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.752
Who's replacing me?

00:35.120 --> 00:36.155
I am.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.316
Good afternoon, Dr. Keller.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.355
How's my newest patient?

00:44.440 --> 00:49.195
Today, he's decided that he will only sleep
as long as I hold him and keep moving.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.191
I've already walked half the city
and back again.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.838
My parents used to put me in the car.

00:52.920 --> 00:53.909
My dad would have to drive

00:54.000 --> 00:56.195
around and around and around the block
at 3:00 in the morning.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.917
That would be lovely.
At least I'd be sitting down.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.355
- I wanted to thank you.
- For what?

01:02.440 --> 01:04.078
I saw Kanaan today.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.037
- How's he doing?
- Much better.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.509
He is himself once again, in every way.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.750
In fact, I'm going to request
that he and many of the others

01:10.840 --> 01:12.432
be allowed to return to the city,

01:12.520 --> 01:15.830
as soon as Mr. Woolsey arrives
in the Daedalus.

01:15.920 --> 01:18.115
I still can't believe Sam's not coming back.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.713
It is difficult.

01:20.920 --> 01:24.515
Well, anyway, it wasn't me
that cured Kanaan and the other hybrids.

01:24.600 --> 01:29.276
It was Dr. Beckett's retrovirus,
and you could thank him in person

01:29.360 --> 01:33.512
if I could just get my head around
all this Wraith medical data.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.397
You believe the answer's
in there somewhere.

01:35.480 --> 01:36.959
We know he was giving Carson a serum

01:37.040 --> 01:38.996
to keep his internal organs
from deteriorating,

01:39.080 --> 01:44.916
and I think I might have found the formula.
I just need to be sure.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.033
Well, at least we know
he's safe for the moment.

01:48.120 --> 01:49.678
Technically, yeah.

01:50.760 --> 01:54.116
I just hate the thought of him
being stuck in that box.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.799
You know, Rodney goes to visit him.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.553
He stands in front of the stasis pod
and tells him all the latest news.

02:01.640 --> 02:02.789
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.873
I walked in on him once by accident,

02:04.960 --> 02:08.669
and he pretended like
he was checking the system or something.

02:10.120 --> 02:12.076
He surprises me sometimes.

02:14.080 --> 02:18.278
Well, this is me once again
being recalled to duty.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.358
Have a nice walk.

02:21.480 --> 02:25.519
Don't worry, Jennifer.
I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:38.520 --> 02:41.034
Sir, Daedalus just dropped
out of hyperspace.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.476
We're receiving a signal.
He's coming down.

02:58.760 --> 03:02.435
- Mr. Woolsey, welcome back.
- Thank you, Colonel.

03:03.720 --> 03:05.119
Well, then...

03:09.440 --> 03:12.193
I think I'll start by going over copies
of all your latest reports.

03:12.280 --> 03:13.554
Yours as well, Doctor.

03:13.640 --> 03:14.755
What, right now?

03:14.840 --> 03:16.671
I've been out of touch
on the Daedalus for three weeks.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.910
I'd like to be brought up to speed
as quickly as possible.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.558
We can have a full briefing in the morning.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.949
Please have the rest of my things
sent directly to my quarters.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.234
Yes, sir.

03:25.200 --> 03:28.829
It was a nice speech. Very inspiring.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.599
All right, let's do one more series,

04:19.680 --> 04:22.831
see if we can get the results
to normalize a little.

04:23.240 --> 04:27.756
- Doctor, you're still here.
- Yeah, I fell asleep at my desk.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.319
Well, if you don't mind me saying,

04:29.400 --> 04:31.197
I think you're pushing yourself
a little hard.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.796
- You should take it easy.
- I know. I'm going to turn in now.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.598
Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.399
Okay, night.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.519
Night.

05:52.320 --> 05:56.598
- McKAY: Did you get any sleep last night?
- Do I really look that bad?

05:56.680 --> 05:59.717
No, no, of course not.
That's not what I meant.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.917
- It's really... It's a lovely...
- Thanks.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.876
Wow. New table?

06:06.960 --> 06:10.350
Woolsey brought it with him.
He said he wanted a little piece of home.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.477
A 12-foot-long mahogany conference table.

06:13.560 --> 06:14.549
I don't get it.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.153
I thought Colonel Carter
was doing a good job.

06:16.240 --> 06:19.596
I agree. We defeated the Replicators,
we thwarted Michael's plans,

06:19.680 --> 06:21.352
and the Wraith are in a state of disarray.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.351
All of this happened
while she was leader of Atlantis.

06:23.440 --> 06:26.318
- That's the problem.
- I don't understand.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.868
She's a victim of her own success.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.791
Now that the threat level is down,

06:30.880 --> 06:34.350
the IOA is going to jump at the chance
to put a civilian back in command.

06:34.440 --> 06:37.750
Well, it's not just that. I mean,
Sam didn't exactly stick to protocol.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.956
- Neither did Weir.
- Right, so for four years,

06:40.040 --> 06:43.112
they've been waiting to get someone
in there who'll finally do things their way.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.316
- Well, I still don't get it.
- Colonel, when you were in the future

06:45.400 --> 06:47.072
and you learned all those things
that were going to happen,

06:47.160 --> 06:49.435
wasn't this one of them,
Woolsey taking over?

06:49.520 --> 06:52.239
Well, the circumstances were different.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.629
Still, it is a little unsettling.

06:55.080 --> 06:58.629
I mean, maybe it's harder to change
the course of events than we thought.

06:58.720 --> 06:59.914
Well, I wouldn't worry about it.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.276
I mean, the fact that Sheppard's here
makes all the difference, right?

07:03.360 --> 07:05.954
Woolsey wasn't the weirdest thing
about that timeline.

07:06.040 --> 07:09.032
- What do you mean?
- Never mind.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.319
Well, I see everyone's here.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.832
Let's get started.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.469
First of all,
I'd like to congratulate all of you

07:24.560 --> 07:28.997
on the success you've had dismantling
what's left of Michael's organization.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.277
Except one thing.
We haven't found him yet.

07:31.360 --> 07:36.115
Well, he was on the cruiser
you destroyed in orbit around M2S-445.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.760
There's a chance
he may have made it off the ship.

07:38.840 --> 07:42.435
Right, you're referring to this statement
given by one of Michael's ex-mercenaries,

07:42.520 --> 07:45.080
- claiming to have seen him alive recently.
- That's what he said.

07:45.160 --> 07:49.517
This is one unsubstantiated report
from a highly unreliable source.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.194
Well, someone stole
our Jumper off that ship.

07:52.280 --> 07:53.759
I thought you needed Ancient DNA

07:53.840 --> 07:55.671
- to pilot one of those.
- Not necessarily.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.274
We developed a gene therapy
that works some of the time.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.989
He is responsible for the deaths
of hundreds of thousands of people.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.513
If there is even a chance
that he is still alive,

08:03.600 --> 08:04.828
we must continue the search.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.559
I'm sorry, but I can't devote
the resources of this base

08:07.640 --> 08:09.631
to the never-ending pursuit
of a single individual

08:09.720 --> 08:11.438
across an entire galaxy.

08:11.520 --> 08:14.478
Even if I knew for a fact he were still alive,
I still wouldn't authorize it,

08:14.560 --> 08:18.473
unless you have some new, credible
evidence as to his whereabouts.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.073
- Do you?
- No.

08:22.480 --> 08:26.678
Then, for the time being,
I shall consider the matter closed.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.359
As to these prisoner hybrids,

08:28.440 --> 08:31.591
I understand they're being held
in a camp on the mainland?

08:31.680 --> 08:32.794
That's right.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.633
And how is
their rehabilitation progressing?

08:38.600 --> 08:39.749
Doctor?

08:41.039 --> 08:42.029
Um...

08:42.320 --> 08:43.594
Right. Uh...

08:44.440 --> 08:48.718
Well, we've had some success
using a slightly modified version

08:48.800 --> 08:52.679
of the original retrovirus
that created Michael in the first place.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.557
It weeds out the Wraith DNA

08:54.640 --> 08:57.996
and allows them to resume
their original human form, over time.

08:58.080 --> 09:02.119
- Without any lasting ill effects?
- None that we've detected so far, no.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.758
Many have already
completed the treatment.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.831
They're wondering
when they might be released.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.708
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
- These people are victims, Mr. Woolsey.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.076
Maybe so, but until very recently,
they were also enemy combatants.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.390
Fine. Well, then,
we'll just keep them there forever.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.277
No, we'll keep them there

09:17.360 --> 09:19.828
until I'm satisfied that they can be trusted.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.759
Now, regarding the situation
with our friend in the stasis pod.

09:26.840 --> 09:30.469
You seem to have been giving a significant
amount of attention to this lately.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.154
Well, once we got our hands
on Michael's medical research,

09:33.240 --> 09:35.959
I thought I should make it a priority
to look for a solution.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.190
- And have you found one?
- Maybe.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.272
We found a serum that,
in lab tests at least,

09:41.360 --> 09:44.477
seems to be capable
of stabilizing the clone cells.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.234
So what's the problem?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.311
Carson was near death
when we put him in that chamber.

09:49.400 --> 09:52.472
I don't want to take him out
until I know for sure,

09:52.560 --> 09:55.313
but lab tests can only do so much.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.755
But that problem's
never going to go away, is it?

09:57.840 --> 09:59.876
If you've reached the limit
of what your research can tell you,

09:59.960 --> 10:01.916
then you need to make a decision.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.312
Either proceed, or put the matter aside
and get back to your regular duty.

10:06.560 --> 10:07.675
Right?

10:10.920 --> 10:13.514
- McKAY: You sure about this?
No.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.558
But we're never going to be sure
unless we give it a shot.

10:16.640 --> 10:20.235
If we don't take a chance now,
he could be in there forever.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.313
All right, then.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.236
Get him on the gurney.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.274
Careful.

10:44.680 --> 10:45.715
Okay.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.271
- Now what?
- Now we take him to the infirmary

10:50.360 --> 10:52.316
and watch for signs
for more cellular degradation.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.628
We should know soon enough.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.994
McKAY: Hey, there. How you doing?

11:08.600 --> 11:11.637
Fine. What happened?

11:11.880 --> 11:14.599
Well, what do you think?
We thawed you out.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.433
It's nice to see you again, Carson.

11:16.520 --> 11:19.751
- Yeah, what's up, Doc? It's been a while.
- Aye.

11:20.360 --> 11:23.557
- How long was I in there?
- Two months, give or take.

11:24.680 --> 11:27.672
- Did I miss anything?
- You know, just the usual.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.119
Well, I've got good news.

11:30.200 --> 11:34.034
At the moment, you're showing
no signs of cellular degradation.

11:34.120 --> 11:37.476
- You were able to recreate the treatment.
- That's right.

11:38.880 --> 11:41.314
I'll let them tell you about it.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.520
Hey, Doc, nice work.

11:45.160 --> 11:48.869
- Well, it's not a permanent solution.
- It's good enough for now.

11:49.640 --> 11:53.758
- Go get some rest.
- Yeah, I think that might be a good idea.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.878
McKAY: There you are.

12:37.080 --> 12:40.595
Gorgeous, isn't it?
- I suppose so.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.714
You know, I really did miss this place.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.235
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.309
What's that supposed to mean?

12:49.400 --> 12:50.879
Look, I just found out
they're sending you back to Earth.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.758
There's a scheduled dial out
this afternoon.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.548
Well, I suppose it's to be expected.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.190
I mean, even with these injections,

13:00.280 --> 13:03.795
I imagine it'll still be months before I'm
in any sort of decent physical condition.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.518
Rodney, this is Teyla.
Come in, please.

13:05.600 --> 13:06.715
Go ahead.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.678
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need your help.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.189
McKAY: What is it?

13:12.280 --> 13:14.874
It's Dr. Keller. She was supposed
to join me for breakfast this morning

13:14.960 --> 13:17.269
- but did not show up.
- So maybe she's sleeping in.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.669
I assumed as much, as well,
and decided not to disturb her.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.239
However, that was four hours ago.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.515
She's now late for her shift,
and she's not responding to radio calls.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.830
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Override the door controls.

13:25.920 --> 13:30.072
- I'm not breaking into her room.
- Rodney, there might be something wrong.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.837
Fine, but if she's just in there sleeping
or naked or something,

13:33.920 --> 13:36.036
you guys are taking the blame.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.239
All right.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.309
For God's sake, Rodney, hurry up.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.950
Jennifer, are you all right?

13:52.200 --> 13:55.237
- Jennifer?
- She must be unconscious.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.235
Pupils dilated.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.311
- Carson, step away from the bed.
- What?

14:02.400 --> 14:05.551
- Step away now!
- What is it?

14:08.920 --> 14:10.194
Dear Lord.

14:11.520 --> 14:14.671
- Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla.
Go ahead.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.591
John, we have a problem.

14:24.200 --> 14:25.553
- What the hell's going on?
- We're not sure.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.790
- This is how we found her.
It must've happened last night.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.711
I've seen
something like this before.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.791
- Where?
- One of Michael's labs.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.711
He was conducting
some kind of experiment.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.791
Well, we've got to get it off of her.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.871
I'm not so certain that's
such a good idea.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.918
From what I can tell, the tendrils
are attached to her and the bed frame.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.151
If we just start ripping them off,
we could cause her serious injury.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.356
Well, we can't just leave her like this.

14:46.440 --> 14:47.919
We need to get her
into an isolation chamber,

14:48.000 --> 14:49.319
and take the whole bed, as well.

14:49.400 --> 14:53.837
That way we can run a full examination,
and see what we're dealing with here.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.029
These things are actually
growing out of her body?

14:58.120 --> 15:00.588
- That's what it looks like.
- Is she conscious?

15:00.680 --> 15:04.150
Beckett says her brain activity
is consistent with somebody in a coma.

15:04.240 --> 15:07.471
- Dr. Beckett is not on active duty.
- He was the first one there.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.710
He says he's seen
something like this before.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.472
While he was a prisoner.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.437
He was forced to work for Michael
for two years.

15:13.520 --> 15:16.273
Nobody knows this stuff
better than he does.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.914
I'm going to try to cut
some of the thinner strands.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.149
Scalpel.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.674
Thank you.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.878
There we go. Nurse?

15:38.320 --> 15:41.596
No change.
- Get that analyzed right away.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.876
Doctor, blood pressure's dropping,
pulse, as well.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.359
That's what I was afraid of.
She's crashing.

15:46.440 --> 15:50.115
Administer five milligrams of atropine.
My God!

15:50.800 --> 15:52.074
Come on.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.359
There she is.

16:03.640 --> 16:06.518
I'm sorry.
I don't dare make another incision.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.390
So much for cutting her loose.

16:12.280 --> 16:14.350
Dr. Beckett, I'd like a word.

16:18.160 --> 16:19.878
Don't worry, I'll get her out.
Once I get back to the lab...

16:19.960 --> 16:21.518
Doctor, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

16:21.600 --> 16:24.114
but our Earth dial out is in one hour.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.674
I'll take a pass on this one,
if you don't mind.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.398
If it wasn't for Dr. Keller,

16:29.480 --> 16:32.233
I'd still be locked in that stasis chamber,
possibly forever.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.959
Dr. Keller's own report is abundantly clear.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.109
While your condition has stabilized,

16:36.200 --> 16:38.873
you've still suffered severe damage
to your internal organs.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.679
You need to be in a hospital bed yourself,
not running a medical investigation.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.159
I'll be fine.

16:43.560 --> 16:46.154
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll step aside, I promise.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.117
You're convinced this has something
to do with Michael.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.919
Well, it's not a case of the hives, is it?

16:56.280 --> 16:57.269
How's she doing?

16:57.360 --> 17:00.033
Vitals have stabilized,
still showing minimal brain function.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.190
We did manage to get blood
and tissue samples.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.999
All right, then we've got some work to do.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.829
You're not sending him back?

17:09.920 --> 17:12.309
He is the closest thing
to an expert we have.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.108
- It's not exactly by the book.
- Don't get used to it.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.189
- How's it coming?
- Slowly.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.592
But I did find something
in Jennifer's blood sample.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.432
- What?
- Easy.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.512
It's some kind of alien pathogen,
so far unidentified.

17:33.600 --> 17:34.999
I'm checking it against the database.

17:35.080 --> 17:38.550
- Is it possible she's turning into a hybrid?
- No, I don't think so.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.596
I've seen several variations
of the conversion process,

17:40.680 --> 17:41.669
but never anything like this.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.909
Well, it's got to be
something to do with Michael.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.958
I mean, she hasn't been offworld
since she helped rescue us from that lab.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.189
That's what I was thinking.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.999
Of course, if that's where
she came in contact with the pathogen...

17:50.080 --> 17:51.877
You think the rest of us
may have been exposed, as well.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.154
Well, aye, it's a possibility.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.356
I'm going to need blood samples
from everyone who was on that planet,

17:55.440 --> 17:57.829
- including you, Rodney.
- Great.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.589
Doctor.

17:59.680 --> 18:00.669
- Yes?
- Yes?

18:00.760 --> 18:02.591
- Yes.
- She's awake.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.238
Thank you. Right.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.873
Oh, my God.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.750
Rodney, what's happening to me?

18:24.080 --> 18:27.755
We're not entirely sure.
It looks like some kind of a cocoon.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.989
- Does it hurt?
- I can't feel anything.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.833
- I can't move.
- Okay, look.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.194
Don't you worry, okay?
We're going to get you out.

18:38.280 --> 18:42.592
- Who else is here?
- What do you mean? There's no one.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.956
I don't want to go to sleep.
I'm afraid I won't wake up.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.315
- Jennifer?
- It's not my fault.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.198
Of course it's not. It's an alien organism.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.031
- What?
- Carson found it in your blood sample.

18:55.120 --> 18:56.553
He's going to figure out what it is,

18:56.640 --> 18:59.712
and then we're going
to figure out how to kill it.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.349
My hand.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.909
- What about it?
- That's where it started.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.515
- I saw it a few nights ago.
- So why didn't you say anything?

19:08.600 --> 19:12.718
I was going to run a scan. I don't know.

19:13.480 --> 19:17.075
It doesn't matter, okay?
We're going to fix this. I promise.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.196
It appears to be affecting her mind.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.157
Aye, she claims to be hearing voices,

19:30.240 --> 19:31.559
like there's someone else
in the room with her.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.153
How fast is it growing?

19:33.240 --> 19:36.550
Currently, it's doubling its mass
every couple of hours.

19:36.640 --> 19:37.914
Thank you.

19:38.560 --> 19:41.074
This isn't just about Dr. Keller anymore.

19:41.160 --> 19:44.152
I need to know if this thing is
going to be a threat to the base.

19:44.240 --> 19:47.630
- I'd say that's a definite yes.
- What do you mean?

19:47.720 --> 19:49.995
Colonel Sheppard, Ronon, Rodney,

19:50.080 --> 19:54.358
everyone who was on M2S-445,
they all tested positive.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.869
Whatever this is, they've all got it.

20:05.240 --> 20:06.639
Right now we're working
under the assumption

20:06.720 --> 20:09.951
that this alien pathogen was present
somewhere in that lab,

20:10.040 --> 20:12.270
possibly as part of one
of Michael's experiments.

20:12.360 --> 20:15.079
When the building was destroyed,
it was released.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.878
We've been back for a month now.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.076
If it was going to spread
to the general population,

20:19.160 --> 20:20.878
- it would've already happened.
- I know.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.758
Dr. Beckett is now fairly confident
that it's not contagious.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.149
Right, then,
why confine us to our quarters?

20:26.240 --> 20:27.753
You've seen what's happening
to Dr. Keller.

20:27.840 --> 20:30.400
- Yeah, but it's not happening to me.
- Not yet.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.755
There could be any number
of random physiological reasons

20:32.840 --> 20:34.990
why it's starting with Dr. Keller,
but that's no guarantee

20:35.120 --> 20:36.917
that it's not going to happen
to the rest of you.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.673
It could be a matter of days.
It could be a matter of hours.

20:39.760 --> 20:43.435
Even Colonel Carter's been quarantined
back at Stargate Command.

20:43.520 --> 20:47.399
Look, I know it's hard for you
to stay on the sidelines, Colonel,

20:47.880 --> 20:49.791
but it's the right call.

20:50.840 --> 20:54.150
In the meantime,
what are we going to do about Keller?

20:56.400 --> 20:58.868
We're still assessing the situation.

21:05.920 --> 21:09.196
We still don't know how the pathogen
causes the physiological changes,

21:09.280 --> 21:13.353
but we've managed to complete
our analysis of the sample I extracted.

21:13.720 --> 21:17.474
Essentially it's a biopolymer,
similar to a polysaccharide,

21:17.560 --> 21:19.437
but with organo-metallic compounds
mixed in.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.431
For the uninitiated, please, Doctor.

21:21.520 --> 21:25.798
It's like the material an insect
or a crustacean uses to form its shell.

21:25.880 --> 21:29.589
At first, it's soft and pliable,
and then it becomes tough and leathery,

21:29.680 --> 21:31.989
and eventually it hardens
into an incredible density,

21:32.080 --> 21:34.310
resistant to heat, pressure
and even radiation.

21:34.400 --> 21:37.039
- Yes, it's like the hull of a ship.
- Aye.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.109
What are you saying?

21:38.200 --> 21:40.953
Look, we always knew that the
Wraith ships were organic in design, right,

21:41.040 --> 21:43.998
that they were essentially grown
instead of constructed.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.274
We've just never witnessed it before.

21:45.360 --> 21:49.035
Are you telling me that a hive ship
is growing inside that isolation room?

21:49.120 --> 21:52.351
Actually, it's no longer
just inside the isolation room.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.510
It doesn't register
on our life-signs detector,

21:54.600 --> 21:56.079
but once we knew
what we were looking for,

21:56.160 --> 22:00.073
we calibrated our internal sensors
and we were able to pick it up.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.598
It has penetrated the walls and the floors,

22:03.680 --> 22:06.478
consuming and converting
the material as it goes.

22:06.560 --> 22:07.993
How far has it spread?

22:08.080 --> 22:12.119
Well, it's gone down three levels already,

22:12.200 --> 22:15.272
and it has attached itself
to the electrical system.

22:15.360 --> 22:16.839
It's siphoning off power as it goes.

22:16.920 --> 22:20.276
This seems to have accelerated
its growth significantly.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.109
How do we stop it?

22:22.200 --> 22:23.918
Well, that's the part
we're still trying to figure out.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.834
We could cut off the power.
That should slow it down quite a bit.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.274
What's happening?

22:33.360 --> 22:34.793
Marie, what's going on?

22:34.880 --> 22:38.236
Doctor, we've been ordered
to evacuate the building.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.594
I'm sorry.

22:50.680 --> 22:53.672
- McKAY: They just left her there?
- I don't think they had much of a choice.

22:53.760 --> 22:56.718
Carson is searching Michael's database
to see if there is anything that can help us.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.916
I suppose it was Zelenka's idea
to shut off the power?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.069
I don't know. Why?

23:00.160 --> 23:02.720
This is ridiculous.
They got us stuck in our quarters

23:02.800 --> 23:04.995
while the new guy takes advice
from the B team?

23:05.080 --> 23:06.354
What is it, Rodney?

23:06.440 --> 23:09.273
They are assuming
that it tapped into the electric grid

23:09.360 --> 23:11.590
by randomly spreading out
through the walls and the floors.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.830
What if it actually grows
towards electromagnetic fields,

23:13.920 --> 23:15.672
like a plant growing towards the sun?

23:15.760 --> 23:19.594
It's going to head directly
for the next available power source.

23:20.520 --> 23:21.669
There.

23:21.760 --> 23:24.797
One of the city's main power conduits
runs beneath the building.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.677
So shut the power down
in that section, as well.

23:26.760 --> 23:30.594
No, we already did, right.
This conduit runs directly into the ZPM.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.148
It's like an express lane.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.434
We've already shut off the rest of traffic,

23:34.520 --> 23:36.238
but this one keeps moving along.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.276
The only way to stop it
would be to pull the ZPM

23:38.360 --> 23:40.715
and shut off power to the entire city.

23:40.800 --> 23:44.634
I had no idea you were so familiar
with the power distribution grid.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.870
I'm not. I spoke to Rodney.

23:50.520 --> 23:51.509
Is there a problem?

23:51.600 --> 23:54.558
The pathogen seems to have
a psychological effect on the host.

23:54.640 --> 23:57.074
At the very least,
we know it can affect their judgment,

23:57.160 --> 23:59.515
possibly well before
any physical symptoms appear.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.750
Yes, but he's not wrong about this.

24:01.840 --> 24:02.829
If it reaches the conduit,

24:02.920 --> 24:05.070
it will have access
to virtually unlimited power.

24:05.160 --> 24:08.436
- And what would happen?
- The growth would increase exponentially.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.432
And since we've shut this section down,
we have no sensors in the area,

24:11.520 --> 24:15.877
so the only way to know how far
it's penetrated is to do a visual inspection.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.996
All right, assemble a team.

24:23.800 --> 24:27.270
I need some answers, Doctor.
How do we kill this thing?

24:27.360 --> 24:29.396
Well, we're working on
a genetically engineered virus

24:29.480 --> 24:33.393
that might be capable of destroying
the pathogen that's infecting Dr. Keller,

24:33.480 --> 24:36.756
but that wouldn't eliminate
the biopolymer itself.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.159
What would?

24:38.720 --> 24:43.157
At this time, Mr. Woolsey, I have no idea.

24:48.440 --> 24:51.796
So the main conduit
runs behind this wall here.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.553
Here, we can access it through this panel.

25:00.120 --> 25:02.998
Sergeant, take your men, split up,
and search the surrounding corridors.

25:03.080 --> 25:05.548
Look for anything that seems unusual.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.877
- All right?
- Okay.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.394
Right, I'll go this way.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.630
- Stay in radio contact.
- Right.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.631
I think I have something.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.550
Looks like Rodney was right.

26:03.320 --> 26:06.676
- Oh, my.
What is it?

26:07.360 --> 26:10.591
Looks like it's attached itself
to the power conduit.

26:10.680 --> 26:12.272
I'm coming to you.

26:16.400 --> 26:20.279
I'm going to see if I can determine
how much power it's draining.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.114
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.750
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.874
- I had no idea it could move like that.
- Nor did I.

27:04.960 --> 27:07.349
This is much worse than we thought.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.874
Looks like it's just a minor concussion.
He should be fine.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.315
So it wasn't bad enough that this thing
was slowly taking over the base.

27:17.400 --> 27:20.472
Now it's attacking people?
We need to put a stop to this now.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.754
It won't be easy.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.115
It's already siphoned off
a massive amount of power.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.158
- We should pull the ZPM.
- That might not be enough.

27:27.240 --> 27:30.038
We could sit here in the dark for weeks
while it just keeps on growing.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.269
We need to get Jennifer out of there.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.952
I want to save Dr. Keller
as much as anyone else,

27:33.040 --> 27:36.350
- but we have additional concerns now.
- Why did it attack Radek?

27:36.440 --> 27:39.000
Because it perceived him as a threat
and took action.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.115
That indicates intelligence,

27:40.200 --> 27:42.509
but as far as we know,
it has no brain of its own.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.272
So you're saying it's using her.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.555
I'm saying it needs her to plan,
to coordinate,

27:46.640 --> 27:48.392
to identify threats and deal with them.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.869
That could explain
why she was hearing voices.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.712
The organism takes over
a portion of the brain

27:52.800 --> 27:56.918
and sets up a separate consciousness,
like multiple personalities.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.560
Aye, otherwise,
why have a human host at all?

27:59.640 --> 28:02.074
So if we separate her
from the main body...

28:02.160 --> 28:05.072
I'd wager the rest of it becomes
as lifeless as a dead tree trunk.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.833
Now, this is the virus
I was telling you about.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.319
It's called a phage,

28:09.400 --> 28:13.075
and it should, at least theoretically,
be able to attack and eliminate

28:13.160 --> 28:15.799
the pathogen that's inside
Jennifer's bloodstream,

28:15.880 --> 28:19.475
and if I'm right about this,
it should sever the connection.

28:20.720 --> 28:24.679
- What's the catch?
- Well, it's never been tested.

28:29.440 --> 28:33.069
We turned the power back on briefly
to get a look inside the building.

28:33.160 --> 28:36.755
This is the ground floor,
five floors below the isolation room.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.956
As you can see,
access is almost completely choked off,

28:39.040 --> 28:40.917
but for this to work,
I need someone to step right up

28:41.000 --> 28:42.991
to Dr. Keller's bed and inject her.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.798
Well, we can use the transporter
to get them close, but...

28:44.880 --> 28:47.633
But you'd still have to run a gauntlet
of over 50 meters.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.439
And after what happened to Dr. Zelenka...

28:50.720 --> 28:54.872
- Well, you understand my dilemma.
- Yeah.

28:55.840 --> 28:56.909
What?

28:59.600 --> 29:04.230
If Dr. Keller really is the key to this thing,
there is an easier way.

29:05.080 --> 29:09.039
We'd only need a couple
of well-aimed shots at the isolation room.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.597
Wait a second,
you're talking about drones?

29:11.680 --> 29:13.159
You're going to fire drones
at one of our own people?

29:13.240 --> 29:14.514
I didn't come to Atlantis with the intention

29:14.600 --> 29:17.068
of killing one of my senior staff
inside of a week,

29:17.160 --> 29:21.392
but my only other option is
to risk someone else's life on a solution

29:22.840 --> 29:25.195
that hasn't even been tested yet.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.111
Not exactly by the book.

29:28.920 --> 29:31.229
So test it. I've got the same bug.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.673
- I'll take a shot right now.
- No, no, no.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.319
I'll do it.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.118
Restraints?

29:45.280 --> 29:48.431
I'm sorry,
but I'm anticipating a severe reaction.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.509
Great.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.830
Now, you're absolutely sure about this?

29:51.920 --> 29:53.273
Remember, the formula
comes from Michael,

29:53.360 --> 29:54.554
so as far as we know, it could...

29:54.640 --> 29:57.393
Turn me into a bug? Been there, done that.

29:57.480 --> 30:00.597
No, actually,
I was going to say it could kill you.

30:02.320 --> 30:06.598
- Just give me the shot.
- Okay.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.833
Now, it should take a few minutes
to kick in, so just

30:15.920 --> 30:19.674
- try to relax.
- Okay, I'll just... I'll relax.

30:19.760 --> 30:21.113
Carson, is it true

30:21.200 --> 30:23.111
that Lorne and some of the others
are beginning to show symptoms?

30:23.200 --> 30:25.430
- Aye, I'm afraid so.
- Oh, God.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.310
Why? Have you noticed
something yourself?

30:28.400 --> 30:31.039
Well, my palms are very sweaty,
and my mouth is very dry.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.394
I'm having heart palpitations.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.233
Okay, so nothing out of the ordinary, then.

30:36.640 --> 30:39.279
- How do you feel?
- I don't feel anything.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.116
I don't even think that...

30:42.600 --> 30:44.352
Sheppard? Hey, Doc.

30:46.360 --> 30:50.990
- I think these restraints were a good idea.
- It's working.

30:57.840 --> 30:58.875
What's our status?

30:58.960 --> 31:00.791
Well, the infirmary
and a few other essential systems

31:00.880 --> 31:03.474
have been switched
to emergency generators.

31:03.560 --> 31:06.870
- We're ready.
- All right, pull the plug.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.311
For God's sake, Carson,
how long's this going to go on for?

31:24.400 --> 31:26.709
I'm sorry, Rodney. I have no idea.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.029
Doc.

31:31.560 --> 31:33.994
His heart stopped. Bag him.
Get a crash cart in here!

31:34.080 --> 31:36.469
Prepare to intubate. One, two, three.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.869
One, two, three. One, two, three.

31:38.960 --> 31:42.316
Come on. One, two, three. One, two, three.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.314
He's back.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.109
How'd I do?

31:58.280 --> 32:01.033
- Are you sure it worked?
- Well, the blood screen came up negative.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.793
As far as I can tell,
the alien pathogen has been eliminated.

32:03.880 --> 32:04.949
Well done.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.871
Now we just need someone
to go into the isolation room.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.951
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

32:09.400 --> 32:13.439
I assume no special medical skill
is required to administer the drug.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.715
Well, no, not really.
It's just a simple injection.

32:15.800 --> 32:18.678
Well, then, given your condition,
I wouldn't make you my first choice.

32:18.760 --> 32:19.829
That's why I said I'd do it.

32:19.920 --> 32:23.037
He doesn't trust us,
because we're still infected.

32:23.120 --> 32:25.236
Actually, that might not be a bad thing.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.834
When Colonel Sheppard was infected
with the Iratus bug DNA,

32:27.920 --> 32:31.037
he was able to walk right into that nest
without being attacked.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.951
You think someone infected
with the pathogen

32:33.040 --> 32:36.794
- would be more likely to get through?
- Well, it's possible.

32:43.240 --> 32:47.074
- All right, I'm in.
- Cut power to the transporter.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.399
How does it look?
- Not so good.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.991
The stuff's everywhere.

33:00.720 --> 33:03.029
Is it reacting to your presence in any way?

33:03.120 --> 33:04.439
Not really.

33:05.080 --> 33:08.197
All right, just be careful.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.116
- What happened?
- It worked.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.997
They just sent Ronon to give her the shot.

33:24.080 --> 33:25.559
- When?
- He just got there.

33:25.640 --> 33:27.995
Look, I'm tapped into the intercom.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.312
Ronon,
what's your status?

33:33.400 --> 33:36.915
Well, it's getting harder to move.
There's too much of it.

33:37.400 --> 33:41.439
Just try not to make any sudden moves
or threatening gestures.

33:41.760 --> 33:44.035
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.834
All right, that's it.

33:52.520 --> 33:56.718
I don't think I can go any further.
The corridor is completely blocked.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.839
All right, so what do you want me to do?

34:04.320 --> 34:05.355
Screw it, I'm going to make a hole.

34:05.440 --> 34:08.237
Ronon, wait!
The only reason you made it this far

34:08.320 --> 34:10.754
is because it senses
the pathogen in your bloodstream.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.159
It thinks you're a friend.

34:12.239 --> 34:15.949
- If you start shooting...
- Does anyone have any better ideas?

34:20.480 --> 34:22.072
What are you doing?

34:22.159 --> 34:25.038
If I'm right, this is about
to go very, very wrong.

34:25.120 --> 34:28.429
- You can't. We're quarantined.
- I'm cured, remember?

34:29.000 --> 34:30.877
There's no other way through.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.474
Once you start shooting,
you'll have to move quickly.

34:33.560 --> 34:35.357
Thanks for the advice.

34:53.679 --> 34:54.795
Ronon?

34:55.679 --> 34:57.636
Ronon, what's your status?

34:58.080 --> 35:00.230
- Ronon, come in!
- Oh, my God.

35:10.680 --> 35:13.240
- What's happening?
- We've lost contact.

35:14.120 --> 35:16.429
Turn the power back on.
Open up a channel to the isolation room.

35:16.520 --> 35:19.557
- What? Why?
- Just do it.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.715
All right, you have a channel.

35:24.800 --> 35:27.189
Dr. Keller, this is Colonel Sheppard.
Do you read?

35:27.280 --> 35:31.432
I hear you,
Colonel, but I'm not Dr. Keller anymore.

35:32.560 --> 35:33.879
Well, who are you?

35:33.960 --> 35:37.714
I have no designation yet.
I'll be given one when I'm complete.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.640
What about Ronon?
- You mean the intruder?

35:40.720 --> 35:42.870
He's alive, for the moment.

35:42.960 --> 35:47.590
He's been neutralized.
I can feel his pulse. It's weak.

35:47.680 --> 35:50.717
It would only take the slightest squeeze.

35:50.800 --> 35:54.873
Yeah, but you don't want to do that
because he's one of you, remember?

35:55.760 --> 35:57.352
Keep her talking.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.557
- Where are you going?
I'm going to go finish this.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.276
Jennifer, this is Carson.

36:05.360 --> 36:09.353
Dr. Beckett, I already told you,
I'm not Jennifer Keller anymore.

36:09.440 --> 36:12.830
You're the voice she was hearing,
the part of her mind that was taking over.

36:12.920 --> 36:16.230
You can't stop me.
I will become as I was meant to be.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.476
Colonel Sheppard
is powering up a Jumper.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.391
Get me a secure channel.

36:27.480 --> 36:30.358
- Sheppard, what are you doing?
- I'm taking a little shortcut.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.476
Sorry I didn't have time
to fill out the paperwork.

36:38.560 --> 36:40.198
Okay, I see it now.

36:41.760 --> 36:44.479
That stuff is growing all over the place.

36:44.840 --> 36:46.273
This may hurt.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.191
Colonel Sheppard, report.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.832
Colonel Sheppard?

38:29.640 --> 38:32.200
Colonel Sheppard, what's your status?

38:33.080 --> 38:34.911
Colonel Sheppard.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.639
Well, I've been better.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.313
What happened?

38:42.840 --> 38:44.751
You better come get us.

38:51.240 --> 38:54.471
- How's Ronon?
- He has a bruised larynx.

38:54.560 --> 38:57.870
Apparently, he won't be able to speak
for several days.

38:58.280 --> 39:01.158
I wonder if anyone
will notice the difference.

39:01.720 --> 39:05.030
Colonel Sheppard,
look who's finally out of isolation.

39:05.480 --> 39:08.950
- It's good to see you, Doc.
- How you feeling?

39:09.280 --> 39:12.352
- It only hurts when I breathe.
- I feel really bad.

39:12.440 --> 39:15.477
It looks like my recovery's
going to be a lot easier than yours.

39:15.560 --> 39:19.155
That's all right.
I've got two doctors looking after me now.

39:19.960 --> 39:23.794
Well, no, I'm afraid not.
I'm scheduled to leave this afternoon.

39:24.360 --> 39:27.875
That is, unless of course there's
a major crisis in the next hour or so.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.837
It wouldn't surprise me.

39:30.640 --> 39:32.835
Well, listen,
you keep yourself out of trouble,

39:32.920 --> 39:34.911
and I'll see you real soon.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.549
- Good luck, Carson.
- Thanks, John.

39:38.200 --> 39:41.476
Welcome back, Dr. Keller.
And, Dr. Beckett,

39:43.080 --> 39:46.311
- thank you.
- My pleasure, Mr. Woolsey.

39:50.720 --> 39:51.709
Before I came down here,

39:51.800 --> 39:54.758
I was on a call
with my superiors back on Earth.

39:55.440 --> 39:58.193
They were going over
my preliminary report.

39:58.480 --> 40:01.392
- What did you tell them?
- The truth.

40:01.480 --> 40:04.199
That in my first three days as commander,

40:04.280 --> 40:07.590
I violated at least half a dozen
basic security protocols.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.159
That many?

40:10.440 --> 40:13.671
I let Beckett run the investigation,
in spite of his condition

40:13.760 --> 40:18.038
and the fact that he's technically
no longer a member of this expedition.

40:18.120 --> 40:21.954
I sent Ronon to deliver the antidote
even though he was infected.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.714
I compromised the safety of this base

40:26.560 --> 40:29.393
to rescue someone who may well
have been beyond our help anyway.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.550
But she wasn't, and we got her out.

40:31.640 --> 40:35.235
And if you had played by the rules,
she'd be dead right now.

40:37.840 --> 40:39.558
The IOA would seem to agree with you.

40:39.640 --> 40:42.757
Apparently, they're willing
to let the matter drop.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.437
So what's the problem?

40:49.960 --> 40:52.713
The rules are there for a reason, Colonel.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.554
If I can't trust them,

40:57.440 --> 40:59.635
then I'm not sure I can do this job.

41:06.880 --> 41:09.030
