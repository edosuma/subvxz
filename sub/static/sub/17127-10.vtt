       IT'S A STOMACHACHE.
  IT'S GOING AROUND THE SCHOOL.

17:07.627 --> 17:10.461
       IT LASTS THREE DAYS.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.362
                 THREE DAYS?

17:11.364 --> 17:12.797
              SO YOU'LL BE FINE

17:12.799 --> 17:16.666
TO GO TO THAT LASER-TAG BIRTHDAY
              PARTY ON SATURDAY?

17:16.669 --> 17:19.637
IS THAT THIS SATURDAY?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.673
            YOU KNOW,
       IF HE'S THIS SICK...

17:22.675 --> 17:24.909
     MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE HIM
         TO THE HOSPITAL.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.412
         I HEAR THEY GOT
      A NEW STOMACH PUMP --

17:27.414 --> 17:28.946
          MORE PRESSURE.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.382
              DID THEY FIX THAT?

17:31.384 --> 17:34.886
'CAUSE I HEARD IT TURNED ONE KID
          COMPLETELY INSIDE OUT.

17:34.888 --> 17:35.753
               OOH.

17:35.755 --> 17:39.157
     OKAY, OKAY.
    I'M NOT SICK.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.491
 HEY...

17:40.493 --> 17:41.726
  SO WHY'D YOU LIE?

17:41.728 --> 17:44.862
   I HAD TO GET OUT OF SCHOOL.

17:44.864 --> 17:48.032
      I WASN'T READY TO TAKE
 MY READING TEST FOR SPECIAL ED.

17:48.034 --> 17:50.768
       DAD TRIED TO HELP ME
        WITH MY HOMEWORK,

17:50.770 --> 17:53.137
         BUT I DON'T HAVE
        THAT KIND OF TIME.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.709
                     MAX,
          WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME?

17:58.711 --> 18:00.211
    YOU SAID WE WERE SELFISH,

18:00.213 --> 18:03.581
  AND WE SHOULD BE DOING THINGS
           ON OUR OWN.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.417
                   HONEY...

18:06.419 --> 18:08.786
        THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

18:08.788 --> 18:12.256
      YOU CAN ALWAYS COME TO ME,
                    OKAY?

18:12.258 --> 18:14.192
                 OKAY.

18:18.531 --> 18:19.897
              SORRY I LIED, DAD.

18:19.899 --> 18:22.633
           I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO
                GET HELD BACK.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.536
WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING
   I WANT TO KNOW.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.105
 HEY, HOW'D YOU FAKE
      THE VOMIT?

18:27.107 --> 18:30.675
               LET'S JUST SAY
               I KNOW A GUY.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.316
                   ANGIE...

18:38.318 --> 18:40.151
    DON'T SAY IT.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.220
 I'LL SAY IT FOR YOU.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.222
    I SCREWED UP.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.991
            WELL, THAT'S NO FUN.

18:46.993 --> 18:51.562
    I OVERDID IT.
I TOOK ON TOO MUCH STUFF.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.731
             SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:53.733 --> 18:56.567
YOU KNOW WHAT I DID TODAY?

18:56.569 --> 18:59.971
   I BROUGHT A MEAL
   TO AN OLD WOMAN.

18:59.973 --> 19:03.574
   SHE THANKED ME.
    SHE HUGGED ME.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.810
   SHE ALSO THOUGHT
 I WAS NATALIE WOOD,

19:05.812 --> 19:08.312
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.681
          ANGIE, I KNOW YOU LIKE
               HELPING PEOPLE.

19:10.683 --> 19:14.085
IT'S NOT JUST HELPING PEOPLE.
 I MADE A DIFFERENCE.

19:14.087 --> 19:17.021
I WASN'T MAKING A DIFFERENCE
 AROUND HERE ANYMORE.

19:17.023 --> 19:19.857
               ARE YOU KIDDING?
     YOU MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.126
              YOU JUST DON'T GET
               THE THANK YOUs.

19:22.128 --> 19:24.295
           KIDS NEVER APPRECIATE
               ANYTHING YOU DO.

19:24.297 --> 19:27.098
  REMEMBER WHEN WE MADE THE DEAL
      THAT ONE OF US WOULD WORK

19:27.100 --> 19:29.534
   AND ONE OF US WOULD STAY HOME
                WITH THE KIDS?

19:29.536 --> 19:32.370
              ANGIE, YOU PICKED
               THE HARDER JOB.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.138
              I GET TO PUNCH IN
                AND PUNCH OUT,

19:34.140 --> 19:38.042
                 BUT [LAUGHS]
              YOU DON'T, SUCKER!

19:38.044 --> 19:42.713
    I'LL CUT BACK.
   THEY DO NEED ME.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.782
            AND I NEED YOU, TOO.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.284
               COME HERE, BABY.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.291
                  YOU KNOW,
            WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,

19:53.293 --> 19:55.993
           YOU SAID WE'D SPEND
       OUR WHOLE LIVES TOGETHER.

19:55.995 --> 19:59.263
   AND THAT DIDN'T SOUND SO GOOD
                  AT FIRST.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.001
         BUT I'VE KIND OF GOTTEN
              USED TO THE IDEA.

20:04.003 --> 20:07.238
       ME TOO.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.673
       Carmen: OH, MY GOD!

20:08.675 --> 20:11.075
              HEY, CARMEN FOUND
               MAX'S UNDERWEAR.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.243
         OH.

20:12.245 --> 20:13.911
                 [ CHUCKLES ]

20:17.016 --> 20:19.717
                   GEORGE!

20:19.719 --> 20:21.385
                WHAT'S WRONG?

20:21.387 --> 20:24.655
     I'M SO SICK.

20:24.657 --> 20:28.092
     BUT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO SEE
        "THE NUTCRACKER" TODAY.

20:28.094 --> 20:31.062
IS THAT THIS SATURDAY?

20:31.064 --> 20:34.465
              YOU JUST STAY HERE
               AND RELAX, OKAY?

20:36.703 --> 20:38.769
      ARE THOSE YOUR GOLF SHOES?

20:38.771 --> 20:40.738
        WHAT?

20:40.740 --> 20:43.608
              AND...YOUR PUTTER!

20:43.610 --> 20:45.343
THAT'S NOT A THERMOMETER?
