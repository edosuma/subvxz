WEBVTT

00:06.423 --> 00:07.799
Excuse me, Yuki.

00:09.217 --> 00:10.051
Hey.

00:10.260 --> 00:13.179
This is Yanagi's doctor friend.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.391
It seems that he used to work
at a hospital in Obihiro.

00:16.933 --> 00:17.851
ONLO?

00:18.101 --> 00:21.646
Yanagi left your counseling to me.

00:22.021 --> 00:25.442
I came here for work. I thought
I would use this chance to see you.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.781
As I thought, she's the one
who shot Mr. Anzai.

00:32.490 --> 00:33.491
But earlier...

00:34.534 --> 00:36.786
If you don't disobey,
I'll let you go safely.

00:38.204 --> 00:41.082
I'm not planning to hurt you,
so just do as I say.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.792
Why would I?

00:43.460 --> 00:44.544
You kill vampires.

00:44.794 --> 00:48.089
I only kill vampires. I don't kill humans.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.633
Vampires are people, too.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.010
Do you support them?

00:52.594 --> 00:55.221
Not really. It's just that I...

00:55.597 --> 00:58.767
It's because you don't know
their desires or brutality,

00:59.100 --> 01:00.393
even their physical transformations.

01:00.810 --> 01:01.686
I know about that.

01:01.936 --> 01:03.313
I don't mean in terms of knowledge.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.815
You've never personally faced it--

01:05.899 --> 01:06.816
I have!

01:08.193 --> 01:11.029
The person I like is a vampire.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.874
An inferiority complex.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.876
Have you experienced one before?

02:48.459 --> 02:50.795
When a vampire goes out with a human,

02:50.879 --> 02:53.381
they tend to become more aware
of their ugly nature.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.302
If they don't carry sedatives around,
they can't fully relax

02:57.510 --> 03:00.513
and they unconsciously avoid talking
to their human partners,

03:00.597 --> 03:02.390
which then makes them lose
their self-confidence.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.059
Are you talking about me?

03:05.435 --> 03:08.062
If you feel that way, then I guess so.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.981
Was the girl from earlier your girlfriend?

03:10.148 --> 03:11.566
She's a cute girl.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.944
Stay here. It's dangerous out there.

03:16.070 --> 03:16.988
I don't want to.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.325
So cute that you can't even let her go?

03:21.409 --> 03:23.703
You're being a bit overprotective,
aren't you?

03:24.412 --> 03:27.790
I just don't want her to be in any danger.

03:28.207 --> 03:29.500
Is that all?

03:30.710 --> 03:34.213
With all that said, you were very scared
when she resisted you.

03:34.547 --> 03:37.300
What are you afraid of, Yuki Anzai?

03:39.761 --> 03:40.595
I'm...

03:42.597 --> 03:45.975
I'm afraid of the demon inside me.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.519
Don't trust vampires.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.522
No matter how much you like them,

03:52.106 --> 03:54.442
the only thing they like about you
is your blood.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.154
Recently, I made him mad at me
when I tried to give him blood.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.951
That's moving forward, I suppose.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.203
You've identified a problem.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.622
I knew that from the start.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.208
You knew,
but you haven't been doing anything.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.669
Do you really know it then?

04:13.378 --> 04:15.380
Why do you think you're so scared?

04:15.588 --> 04:16.589
Why?

04:18.049 --> 04:19.926
Obviously, because I'm a vampire.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.137
I'm starving.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.723
Long time no see, Kleeman.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.768
You're the doctor who told me
to handle bloodlust by masturbating!

04:29.477 --> 04:32.105
-What the...
-Did you run away from home?

04:32.313 --> 04:34.190
You seem to be able
to escape pretty often.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.734
ONLO must be bothered right about now.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.820
Hey, I want the details of...

04:38.987 --> 04:40.363
Anzai, look at him.

04:41.656 --> 04:44.826
He's an example of someone
who isn't afraid of his vampire side.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.245
He doesn't care about
whether he's a human or a vampire.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.999
But it doesn't mean he was born like this.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.794
There's only one reason why
he's able to live without worrying.

04:55.211 --> 04:58.548
He learned to control
the demon inside him.

05:04.804 --> 05:05.722
Get off.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.807
They know this car's license plate.
It's inconvenient.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.058
We'll look for another.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.394
We better go to a hospital.

05:11.978 --> 05:15.773
A hostage worried about her kidnapper?
How thoughtful.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.152
My comrade disobeyed orders for my sake.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.154
He might be killed.

05:22.196 --> 05:23.823
Another one is already dead.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.242
Our leader has no mercy.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.037
If I don't save him now,
it'll be too late.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.457
Why don't you report it and save him
with the help of the police?

05:32.790 --> 05:36.085
The police have always been unreliable.

05:47.764 --> 05:48.765
Welcome back.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.444
Are you telling me to drink blood
to build a tolerance like this guy?

06:01.778 --> 06:06.783
Drinking blood isn't the point here.
It all depends on the individual.

06:06.949 --> 06:09.035
What happens to you when you transform?

06:09.368 --> 06:11.913
What situations affect you?

06:12.246 --> 06:14.540
It's important to understand all of that.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.251
That way, you're not excessively afraid.

06:18.294 --> 06:19.670
I heard it from Yanagi.

06:19.837 --> 06:24.008
You're afraid to transform
when you're near her.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.426
What?

06:25.510 --> 06:27.720
That's why you need
to know yourself first.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.556
In order to face your girlfriend
and protect her as well.

06:31.599 --> 06:35.061
There are ways to control your bloodlust.

06:35.603 --> 06:38.898
But for that, you'll need
your girlfriend's help.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.192
Wait!

06:42.193 --> 06:43.778
Emergency message from B2 headquarters.

06:44.529 --> 06:47.949
The sniper suspect, Target "T",
took a hostage, stole a car,

06:48.157 --> 06:49.659
and escaped from Shirase Hospital.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.995
The hostage is a young lady
with short hair and a scar on her face.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.792
We're here, Zero-Seven.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.545
I couldn't stop myself from helping.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.922
Am I being too naive?

07:03.464 --> 07:05.049
Are we being chased, Zero-Nine?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.301
Don't worry and rest well.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.138
I'm listening to the police scanner.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.265
I'll tell you if there's any movement.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.017
What is it that you actually do?

07:16.894 --> 07:18.062
Vampire extermination.

07:19.689 --> 07:23.276
We want to uncover the secret of vampires,

07:23.734 --> 07:25.153
bring attention to their danger

07:25.653 --> 07:27.113
and wipe them out completely.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.489
Wipe them out?

07:29.574 --> 07:31.200
Hey! What are you planning to do?

07:31.576 --> 07:33.244
I can't wait here and do nothing!

07:33.369 --> 07:34.912
Vampires are supposed to be on standby!

07:35.413 --> 07:37.165
Besides, you don't know where she is.

07:37.582 --> 07:38.833
Even if you search blindly...

07:39.041 --> 07:41.752
The sniper is the girl
with the rifle, right?

07:42.128 --> 07:44.547
If that was the case, I don't think
she would hurt Tsukasa.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.257
She seemed reasonable.

07:46.924 --> 07:51.012
Yanagi said so, too.
She didn't look like she would hurt her.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.556
That woman already killed five vampires!

07:53.848 --> 07:55.349
That's the point.

07:55.558 --> 07:59.562
She only kills vampires.
She doesn't think of it as killing people.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.732
She may even think of it as pest control.

08:04.150 --> 08:08.404
But if she sees you, I think
she'll be forced to do so.

08:09.238 --> 08:13.910
You like a vampire, right?
Why did you fall for one?

08:14.744 --> 08:16.704
Didn't you know he was a vampire
when you fell for him?

08:17.163 --> 08:19.665
It happened after I found out!

08:20.333 --> 08:22.001
Why did you fall for him even if you knew?

08:22.585 --> 08:23.544
Why?

08:24.045 --> 08:27.131
Vampires and humans,
aren't they just the same?

08:27.673 --> 08:31.344
Aside from their reaction to blood,
only the dark eye circles give them away.

08:31.969 --> 08:34.972
Vampires who drink blood
won't even have them.

08:36.349 --> 08:40.603
Once they drink blood,
they won't have dark eye circles?

08:42.230 --> 08:43.231
Zero-Seven!

08:44.815 --> 08:45.900
There's an update!

08:46.275 --> 08:48.486
Public Safety found the car you abandoned.

08:48.861 --> 08:52.490
Also, Zero-Six and Zero-Five's GPS
is offline!

08:53.324 --> 08:56.160
-You've cut ours off, right?
-Yes.

08:57.662 --> 09:02.625
I wonder if Zero-Six and Zero-Five
were ordered to go after us.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.001
I'm afraid so.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.504
But they're both a part of Public Safety.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.839
They can't move freely.

09:10.633 --> 09:14.262
I said it before, didn't I?
You can't rely on the police.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.147
Sawazaki of Squad F.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.985
A vampire-only bar, Cross,
has been attacked. Two deaths.

09:29.694 --> 09:33.364
Squad B's Sergeant Makimura,
who was guarding the bar, is missing.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.325
Does this mean Makimura was the spy?

09:37.034 --> 09:39.912
Shit! What is this unpleasant feeling?

09:40.705 --> 09:43.124
How many are we actually dealing with?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.751
The stolen car was abandoned here.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.296
There are two convenience stores nearby.

09:49.213 --> 09:52.842
Check their surveillance cameras,
and look for witnesses.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.844
Check with the taxi companies

09:54.927 --> 09:57.179
if ever taxis around here
picked up injured passengers.

09:57.346 --> 09:58.180
Yes, sir!

09:58.306 --> 10:00.558
You have comrades
in Public Safety Division 5?

10:01.309 --> 10:03.311
It's better than regular people
who don't--

10:03.394 --> 10:05.563
The person I like is an officer there.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.232
He's also the guy you shot before.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.153
I was with him when he was shot.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.199
Oh, right. You're that girl...

10:17.658 --> 10:19.201
Zero-Seven, Zero-Six

10:19.619 --> 10:22.288
attacked a bar in Ikebukuro,
and separated from Division 5.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.499
Don't meddle in our affairs anymore.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.419
I'm already a part of it now.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.881
Does your guy want you to be involved?

10:32.757 --> 10:34.759
Officers are trained
and they can use weapons.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.637
We're also armed and trained.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.430
You're different!

10:44.560 --> 10:49.940
Someday, there will be things
that are safe for you to do.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.153
Kikuhara, we found the taxi.

10:54.445 --> 10:55.363
The location is...

10:57.740 --> 10:58.658
I found you.

11:01.786 --> 11:02.703
Are you okay?

11:02.995 --> 11:06.582
I keep thinking if I can do something.

11:07.416 --> 11:10.002
But I was told to just stay inside
and do nothing.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.088
I ended up rebelling and going out.

11:15.674 --> 11:19.512
It's natural to try and be useful
to the person you like.

11:21.555 --> 11:25.476
I need to know myself enough
to stop being afraid.

11:26.143 --> 11:29.897
Well, to do that,
I'll need Tsukasa's help.

11:30.773 --> 11:34.360
Even if I try to keep my distance
to protect her from danger,

11:35.361 --> 11:39.782
she really isn't that afraid of me.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.618
No, it was like that from the start.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.413
She always looked me in the eye.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.290
She never hesitated to say or do anything.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.086
That's what I like about her.

11:52.962 --> 11:56.215
But that's precisely
why I should never hurt her.

11:57.633 --> 11:58.717
I must protect her.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.970
To do that, I...

12:01.178 --> 12:03.514
If you're going to save her, I'll help.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.559
I know you're from ONLO.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.104
But trusting you is another issue.

12:10.646 --> 12:11.939
Wow, thanks a lot.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.859
But, as a vampire, I can trust you.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.947
The more I want to protect her,
the more I can't get close to her.

12:21.365 --> 12:25.786
If I transform,
will you make sure she's safe?

12:28.205 --> 12:31.917
"I want to protect her."
Is that why you keep avoiding her?

12:32.835 --> 12:37.047
If you're from ONLO, I thought
you would be stronger than that.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.092
Tsukasa is always facing you bravely.

12:40.384 --> 12:45.055
But you keep telling her to stay away
and refuse to talk to her, right?

12:45.556 --> 12:47.892
I bet you can't even explain
why you won't go near her.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.226
Are you a child?

12:49.643 --> 12:51.479
You can't even say something
that important.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.983
If you're going to keep on
saying things like that,

12:57.234 --> 12:59.445
then should I just take Tsukasa from you?

13:06.535 --> 13:09.079
Zero-Five? What are Zero-Two's orders?

13:10.498 --> 13:11.332
I got it.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.667
Zero-Seven and Zero-Nine.
The hostage as well.

13:14.418 --> 13:15.836
I'll deal with them quickly.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.130
You must be cold in that.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.174
Here. An apology for dragging you
into this mess.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.510
POST A MESSAGE IF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE

13:23.010 --> 13:23.928
This is strange.

13:24.178 --> 13:27.556
The car was already found,
but there aren't any orders.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.351
They must be giving orders
over private channels.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.186
Let's make a move now.

13:32.561 --> 13:34.063
We'll part here.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.066
I'll make a report. So, just wait here.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.735
I'll tell you this in advance.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.613
Beware of Public Safety
Division 5's Naoya Ushio.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.199
He has wavy hair and a birthmark
on his cheek.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.117
He might already be on his way.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.411
His code name is Zero-Five.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.667
That thing is in the bag.
We'll let her have it, just in case.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.337
Stay safe.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.424
Yes, I'm sure it was room 902.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.099
We're the police. Are you hurt?

14:17.314 --> 14:18.983
When did the culprit leave?

14:19.525 --> 14:20.985
Not too long ago.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.112
Nanno, I'll carry her out.

14:23.612 --> 14:24.697
Her complexion is off.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.658
It's okay, I can walk.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.661
What should I do? This guy is Zero-Five.

14:31.287 --> 14:35.499
I understand.
Let's go downstairs together. Slowly.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.043
I'll meet you guys downstairs.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.421
Let's go separately, just in case.

14:41.005 --> 14:41.922
It's Zero-Five.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.258
Will she be fine?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.802
I don't think he has a reason to hurt her.

14:47.678 --> 14:48.804
We've lost our chance to escape.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.056
I think there are officers downstairs too.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.600
What should we do?

14:59.356 --> 15:00.316
Raise your face.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.067
What did you hear?

15:02.484 --> 15:03.319
What do you mean?

15:04.194 --> 15:07.364
The destination of your kidnappers,
their future goals,

15:08.157 --> 15:12.494
or that Public Division 5's
Ushio is a spy?

15:13.579 --> 15:15.414
There, it's written on your face.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.084
The elevator is here. Hurry!

15:19.460 --> 15:20.878
Sorry, wait up!

15:24.506 --> 15:25.466
The doors are closing.

15:29.511 --> 15:30.346
Are you okay?

15:33.766 --> 15:36.018
I ended up using the stun gun.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.396
It won't make him faint. Be careful.

15:40.397 --> 15:41.482
I need to run away fast.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.026
But if I go downstairs,
I'll bump into him.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.500
I don't know Mr. Anzai's phone number.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.044
I don't know Sawazaki's either.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.672
Or Jill's, Yanagi's, or the bar owner's.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.050
The bar owner.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.176
BAR SAKAKI

16:10.844 --> 16:12.179
Wait, Zero-Seven, are you for real?

16:12.429 --> 16:14.848
You want to wait on the roof
until the police leave?

16:15.182 --> 16:16.600
Do you think I'm joking?

16:17.017 --> 16:19.478
If we're not careful,
we might end up being trapped.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.189
Hide, Zero-Nine!

16:24.233 --> 16:25.109
Zero-Seven!

16:25.651 --> 16:27.528
Don't make a fuss. It's nothing.

16:27.778 --> 16:28.612
But...

16:29.822 --> 16:30.698
This is too much.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.826
First, I was stabbed.
This time, I got shot.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.161
These people were my comrades.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.790
I only expected vampires to be my enemies.

16:41.041 --> 16:44.378
I'm human and I'm on your side
even if it means I'll die!

16:46.797 --> 16:49.299
If you're going to keep on
saying things like that,

16:49.967 --> 16:51.885
then should I just take Tsukasa from you?

16:52.094 --> 16:54.430
What the hell are you saying?

16:54.805 --> 16:55.806
Japanese.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.726
If you a lay a hand on her, I'll kill you!

16:59.268 --> 17:01.562
Be my guest. That is, if you can.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.940
Wait! Yuki, the phone.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.818
There was a call to the bar. It's Tsukasa!

17:09.361 --> 17:11.864
Mr. Anzai? I'm glad it got through.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.824
Are you okay? Where are you now?

17:14.408 --> 17:16.577
A place called Mino Hotel in Tsukiji.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.996
The sniper? Weren't you held hostage?

17:19.747 --> 17:20.873
I was released.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.083
But now, I'm being chased by someone else.

17:24.293 --> 17:25.127
Someone else?

17:25.461 --> 17:27.087
The sniper told me about him.

17:27.671 --> 17:30.132
Public Division 5's Ushio is a spy.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.635
I'm afraid I'll get caught if I go down.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.512
I ended up hiding in a higher floor.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.015
Is there a place you can hide?

17:39.099 --> 17:41.685
I think I can hide in room 1424.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.645
I got it. I'll go there right now.

17:43.812 --> 17:44.855
Hide there.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.566
Look, Mr. Anzai. I'm sorry.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.403
Sorry for saying the things
I shouldn't have.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.364
It's not your fault!

17:54.740 --> 17:55.741
Just wait there!

17:56.241 --> 17:57.201
This is the 14th floor.

18:00.662 --> 18:01.872
The doors are closing.

18:03.582 --> 18:04.541
Excuse me.

18:17.513 --> 18:18.764
I found you.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.934
Shall we end things here?

18:23.560 --> 18:26.605
The first time I saw her,
I thought she was cute.

18:29.191 --> 18:32.945
A pure girl who seemed untainted
by the dark side of society.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.909
I'm glad I found her
before she became a victim.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.163
Why am I recalling all this right now?

18:44.373 --> 18:45.666
Come here.

18:46.875 --> 18:50.587
You don't need to worry.
I'll send you off painlessly.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.007
Why must you kill me?

18:54.758 --> 18:56.593
I want to stay in Division 5
for a bit more.

18:57.052 --> 19:00.973
If you exposed me as a spy for CCC,
won't I be in trouble?

19:01.723 --> 19:02.766
CCC?

19:06.353 --> 19:08.313
A community of chosen citizens.

19:10.274 --> 19:13.443
A group of murderers who were chosen?

19:15.362 --> 19:16.572
Is there a problem?

19:17.114 --> 19:18.115
It's strange!

19:18.365 --> 19:21.618
You're killing people
while carrying a good name!

19:21.869 --> 19:23.120
That's just an opinion.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.497
Whether it's right or wrong
is a different story.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.542
Do you have something
against vampires, too?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.961
I don't. In fact, I like them.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.423
I just think they're pitiful.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.842
I have vampire colleagues.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.011
When there are wounded people
at crime scenes,

19:39.636 --> 19:41.555
they make a really pained expression.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.892
They grit their fangs,

19:45.100 --> 19:46.685
fight their bloodlust,
and beg for sedatives.

19:47.227 --> 19:50.939
They even get called monsters
by the people they have saved.

19:52.065 --> 19:53.150
They're really pitiful.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.111
Whenever I see vampires,

19:56.570 --> 19:58.530
I want to set them free

19:59.531 --> 20:01.283
from that cursed fate.

20:03.118 --> 20:05.954
Hey, do you know
what that Ushio guy looks like?

20:06.205 --> 20:07.122
How should I?

20:07.623 --> 20:09.458
I can't trust Division 5 anymore.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.460
I can only save her myself.

20:12.502 --> 20:13.420
Tsukasa.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.673
Why do I always put you in danger?

20:18.175 --> 20:19.009
Why?

20:19.885 --> 20:22.763
If you want to free vampires,
why are you trying to kill them?

20:23.347 --> 20:24.181
If they're important,

20:24.431 --> 20:26.683
shouldn't you think of a way
to live together?

20:26.934 --> 20:28.518
That's just a form of ego, right?

20:29.144 --> 20:31.647
You can't live their lives.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.441
You don't know their pain.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.401
Aren't you the same?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.446
You can't live their lives either.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.158
But you still say things
about freeing them.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.410
Then you take away their lives.

20:46.119 --> 20:49.122
Stop acting nice
while looking down on them!

20:51.291 --> 20:52.918
I changed my opinion about you.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.047
You don't beg for your life
in this situation.

20:57.297 --> 20:59.007
In fact, you clearly stated your opinion.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.885
It just annoys people, you know.

21:03.553 --> 21:07.182
Are you brave? Or simply just an idiot?

21:12.354 --> 21:14.398
Whatever, I guess it makes no difference.

21:31.331 --> 21:32.249
Are you afraid?

21:32.582 --> 21:35.002
Everyone here is a vampire.

21:35.711 --> 21:36.962
Just like you.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.038
Devils' Line.

23:35.747 --> 23:36.915
Line 8.

23:37.582 --> 23:38.583
Offline.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.836
