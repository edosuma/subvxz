00:02.177 --> 00:03.878
ANDRE: What is a group penguins called?

00:03.945 --> 00:04.879
PETE: A) Mungel.

00:04.947 --> 00:05.880
RUXIN: B) Creche.

00:05.948 --> 00:07.882
Final answer-- Oh... creche!

00:07.950 --> 00:08.616
Oh, yeah!

00:08.684 --> 00:10.906
(high-pitched): CoCo Beware!

00:11.026 --> 00:12.042
CoCo Beware!

00:12.162 --> 00:15.097
On the border of which two
countries does Mount Everest lie?

00:15.165 --> 00:16.097
A) India and China?

00:16.166 --> 00:17.099
TACO: Trivia time.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.100
B) Tibet and Nepal.

00:18.168 --> 00:19.101
Whoa.

00:19.169 --> 00:20.102
Bam!

00:20.170 --> 00:21.103
Killing it!

00:21.171 --> 00:24.973
Oh, yeah, mother-fah...!

00:25.041 --> 00:28.476
It's not even fun playing this-- I
just dominate you guys so severely.

00:28.544 --> 00:29.477
No.

00:29.545 --> 00:30.478
What is the largest "dessert"

00:30.546 --> 00:31.479
in the world?

00:31.547 --> 00:32.479
This thing's broken.

00:32.548 --> 00:33.481
Banana split's not even there.

00:33.549 --> 00:35.117
You think you're smarter than us?

00:35.185 --> 00:38.620
(laughs): Oh, my God, I destroyed
<i>all</i> of you guys on the SAT's.

00:38.688 --> 00:40.823
The SAT's are culturally biased.

00:40.890 --> 00:42.825
That's why I got high and rode
a snowmobile through a mall

00:42.892 --> 00:43.826
instead of taking them.

00:43.893 --> 00:46.829
Guys, I was in school longest, I'm the
smartest-- that's the way it works.

00:46.896 --> 00:50.498
Andre, I have a fake notary degree
from a Venezuelan vocational school.

00:50.566 --> 00:52.667
Trust me, it doesn't make you a genius.

00:52.736 --> 00:55.337
By the way, I'm not sure that
banana split's the biggest

00:55.404 --> 00:56.841
dessert-- I was just guessing.

00:57.131 --> 01:00.565

01:00.685 --> 01:01.276
Hey!

01:01.344 --> 01:03.278
KEVIN: Hey, I have an
announcement to make.

01:03.346 --> 01:07.082
After some careful consideration, I've
decided to run for public office.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.083
Really?

01:08.151 --> 01:11.153
If you're gonna be working at
the DMV, I need a license.

01:11.221 --> 01:14.022
No, I, uh, I've decided
to run for judge.

01:14.090 --> 01:15.023
You're gonna be a judge?

01:15.091 --> 01:17.359
Is there any chance that
you're just doing this because

01:17.426 --> 01:18.660
you're not commissioner anymore?

01:18.728 --> 01:20.996
No, I'm meeting with the
judging committee tomorrow, so

01:21.064 --> 01:21.997
we'll see how that goes.

01:22.065 --> 01:24.633
Listen, Kevin, you know I love you...
We all do.

01:24.700 --> 01:25.634
Mm.

01:25.701 --> 01:26.635
I'm not sure I see this.

01:26.702 --> 01:28.270
Judges are supposed to be impartial.

01:28.337 --> 01:29.271
All you do is freak out.

01:29.338 --> 01:30.272
I do not freak out.

01:30.339 --> 01:31.273
Look at your face.

01:31.340 --> 01:32.274
How can you have a judge face?

01:32.341 --> 01:33.275
You freak.

01:33.342 --> 01:34.276
I have a judge face.

01:34.343 --> 01:35.944
You want to see what it looks like?

01:36.012 --> 01:37.679
Love to.

01:37.747 --> 01:41.216
Looks like you're trying to pass one of
these wasabi peas through your urethra.

01:41.284 --> 01:43.218
(low growl): Mmm... What are you doing?

01:43.286 --> 01:44.219
I'm being wise.

01:44.287 --> 01:45.553
Let me give you a tip.

01:45.621 --> 01:48.556
"Mmm" is the least wise
sound you can make.

01:48.624 --> 01:49.958
You'd be a terrible judge.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.960
Judges are bald and distinguished.

01:52.028 --> 01:54.062
Andre could be a judge,
if he were distinguished.

01:54.130 --> 01:55.164
Hey, I'm not bald.

01:55.231 --> 01:56.165
What's that, now?

01:56.232 --> 01:57.199
Guys, I'm not bald.

01:57.267 --> 02:01.403
Look, I have, like, very, you know,
thin, like, like, clear hair.

02:01.470 --> 02:03.638
Okay, so these are basically
like those clear friends you

02:03.706 --> 02:04.840
played with growing up.

02:04.908 --> 02:07.209
Or like that clear girlfriend
you had at camp who let you

02:07.277 --> 02:09.211
finger her in the water ski shack.

02:09.279 --> 02:10.544
Guys, I have hair.

02:10.613 --> 02:12.547
I'm gonna need a ruling on this one.

02:12.615 --> 02:15.383
Judge Kevin, here's your first case.

02:15.451 --> 02:18.854
Bald! And may God have
mercy on your scalp.

02:18.922 --> 02:20.856
No, that looks like
your vinegar strokes.

02:20.924 --> 02:26.895
(low growl): Mmm... Mr. McArthur, I don't
know whether or not you're prepared

02:26.963 --> 02:29.497
for the rigors of judgeship.

02:29.565 --> 02:33.836
Most lawyers cut their teeth being
commissioner before serving as a judge.

02:33.903 --> 02:36.004
Well, then, you know, you're
talking to the right guy.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.273
I've been a commissioner
for the past eight years.

02:38.341 --> 02:39.274
Oh.

02:39.342 --> 02:41.710
Yeah, I've been dealing with
parties who would do anything to

02:41.777 --> 02:47.682
stab the other person in the back--
manipulation, collusion... Antitrust.

02:47.750 --> 02:48.683
Yes, nobody trusts anybody.

02:48.751 --> 02:49.284
Yeah.

02:49.352 --> 02:52.354
I don't trust him, he doesn't
trust him, nobody trusts my

02:52.421 --> 02:57.226
wife, and when it comes down to it, I
just want to have fun and I want to win.

02:57.293 --> 02:58.227
I like your passion.

02:58.294 --> 02:59.228
Thank you.

02:59.295 --> 03:01.230
This league that I'm in... Mm.

03:01.297 --> 03:03.232
...is competitive... What's the name?

03:03.299 --> 03:04.233
Yeah, it's got a name.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.234
What is it?

03:05.301 --> 03:11.539
It is the League of Extraordinary
Business... Gentlemen.

03:11.607 --> 03:13.141
JENNY: So, you think
it went well today.

03:13.209 --> 03:15.143
No, no, I <i>know</i> it went well today.

03:15.211 --> 03:16.144
Really?

03:16.212 --> 03:17.779
Well, Ellie, this is
a lovely tea party.

03:17.847 --> 03:19.781
Thank you so much for inviting me.

03:19.849 --> 03:21.783
And I hope you have
non-gluten options here?

03:21.851 --> 03:23.785
And in the middle of the
meeting, I realized there's

03:23.853 --> 03:27.655
really nothing that a judge does
that a fantasy commissioner doesn't.

03:27.723 --> 03:29.557
Except for sentencing people to prison.

03:29.625 --> 03:31.593
God, I wish when I was
commissioner I could've put some

03:31.660 --> 03:32.594
of these frittatas in prison.

03:32.661 --> 03:35.597
Wait, let me get this straight-- you
want to be a judge just to get back at

03:35.664 --> 03:36.231
people?

03:36.299 --> 03:38.233
No, it's about justice, Andre.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.436
Justice for all of those who
have stood in my way for years.

03:41.504 --> 03:42.437
That's vengeance.

03:42.505 --> 03:43.438
Yeah.

03:43.506 --> 03:44.940
Oh. (chuckles)

03:45.008 --> 03:45.941
What a nice little hat.

03:46.009 --> 03:47.142
To what do I owe the pleasure?

03:47.210 --> 03:49.344
I'm putting a hat on your
head so your head doesn't get

03:49.412 --> 03:51.079
cold, 'cause you don't have any hair.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.080
I do... I do have hair.

03:52.148 --> 03:53.081
I have hair.

03:53.149 --> 03:54.316
Actually, no, you don't.

03:54.384 --> 03:55.317
This is hair.

03:55.385 --> 03:57.319
You don't have hair, you have skin.

03:57.387 --> 04:00.088
No, I have, um... like, a clear hair.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.090
There's no such thing as clear hair.

04:02.158 --> 04:05.093
Okay, you know what, there's no
such thing as a backyard tea party.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.095
I mean, I don't even
know what the theme is.

04:07.163 --> 04:10.299
Are we in an American girl place, or are
we supposed to be in Colonial London?

04:10.366 --> 04:11.666
And this pink tea, what is <i>that?</i>

04:11.734 --> 04:12.834
<i>It's pretend!</i>

04:12.902 --> 04:13.835
<i>Like your hair.</i>

04:13.903 --> 04:15.037
<i>Okay, you know what?</i>

04:15.104 --> 04:17.272
<i>I think my time at this
tea party is done.</i>

04:17.339 --> 04:19.975
<i>I have some places to be, so
I will see you all... later.</i>

04:20.043 --> 04:21.976
<i>You are really good with kids, Andre.</i>

04:22.045 --> 04:22.978
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:23.046 --> 04:23.979
<i>(Ellie whines)</i>

04:24.047 --> 04:27.115
<i>Aw, you're the first person
to ever be sad Andre's left.</i>

04:35.812 --> 04:39.281
Things went very, very well
with Judge Hobart-- so much so,

04:39.349 --> 04:42.584
that he invited me to some educational
charity function next week.

04:42.652 --> 04:45.021
The whole judging committee's
gonna be there, so I bought a

04:45.088 --> 04:48.624
table and I wanted to invite
all of you to come-- under one

04:48.691 --> 04:52.028
condition: you cannot
embarrass me at all.

04:52.095 --> 04:54.263
Well, what if I get a fear boner?

04:54.331 --> 04:58.367
I also have been known to light my crotch
on fire when I'm in banquet halls.

04:58.435 --> 04:59.701
Oh, very funny.

04:59.769 --> 05:03.105
See, all those things happened
to someone you know as Kevin,

05:03.173 --> 05:06.075
but they did not happen to...
(taps table)

05:06.143 --> 05:07.076
...Judge McArthur.

05:07.144 --> 05:09.578
So which one traded away
his son's naming rights?

05:09.646 --> 05:10.612
That would be Kevin.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.614
Okay, and which one of you
Yobogoya'd on the side of the

05:12.682 --> 05:14.250
road in front of Ellie's teacher?

05:14.317 --> 05:16.252
That was an emergency, but
it would also be Kevin.

05:16.319 --> 05:19.255
Yeah, you probably don't want to do
that face at the charity dinner.

05:19.322 --> 05:21.924
Unless judges are supposed to look
like they're shitting out a yam.

05:21.991 --> 05:23.926
Gentlemen! I know there's been
a lot of talk lately about

05:23.993 --> 05:25.928
who is the smartest
person in the league.

05:25.995 --> 05:27.563
I thought we decided it was me.

05:27.630 --> 05:29.831
Well, I have decided to settle
this issue once and for

05:29.899 --> 05:31.900
all, and there's only one way to do it.

05:31.968 --> 05:32.901
Oh. IQ test.

05:32.969 --> 05:33.902
Nope.

05:33.970 --> 05:35.504
Uh, removing our brains
and studying them.

05:35.572 --> 05:36.738
Good idea, but no.

05:36.806 --> 05:39.841
We are going to take the
Wonderlic, the very intelligence

05:39.909 --> 05:42.010
test that all the NFL players take.

05:42.079 --> 05:43.245
I ordered it from the company.

05:43.313 --> 05:44.780
I have not looked at it yet.

05:44.847 --> 05:46.248
50 questions in ten minutes.

05:46.316 --> 05:47.783
Highest score wins. Who's in?

05:47.850 --> 05:48.951
I'll do it. Yeah, I'll do it.

05:49.018 --> 05:50.352
Yeah? Come on, it'll be fun.

05:50.420 --> 05:52.455
I don't need to take a test to
prove that I'm smarter than

05:52.522 --> 05:54.457
you-- I already did that years ago.

05:54.524 --> 05:58.194
I think your wiener over there is shrinking
at the thought that one of us might

05:58.261 --> 05:59.462
beat you in this thing.

05:59.529 --> 06:01.964
My wiener is currently filling
with blood because of

06:02.031 --> 06:04.633
the confidence that I feel that
I am so much more intelligent

06:04.701 --> 06:07.470
than you-- I like to call
it an intell-erection.

06:07.537 --> 06:08.870
Sounds great. Prove it.

06:08.938 --> 06:11.440
All right, I need all phones
inside the basket, please.

06:11.508 --> 06:12.441
Pass them down.

06:12.509 --> 06:15.777
Test is being handed to you facedown.

06:15.845 --> 06:18.514
Do not look at the test
until the timer starts.

06:18.582 --> 06:20.716
That means no peeking.

06:20.783 --> 06:21.717
It was crooked.

06:21.784 --> 06:23.952
All right, we got ten minutes
to complete the test.

06:24.020 --> 06:24.953
The timer starts now.

06:25.021 --> 06:25.954
Okay.

06:26.022 --> 06:27.055
I'm gonna go smoke a bowl.

06:27.124 --> 06:28.056
I'll be right back.

06:28.125 --> 06:29.057
Holy shit, is this for real?

06:29.126 --> 06:31.227
These seem hard, but they're... not.

06:31.294 --> 06:32.228
There's a lot of math.

06:32.295 --> 06:34.863
How can an electronics store have
an 182 customers in one day?

06:34.931 --> 06:37.500
I don't understand why you need
to know fractions for the NFL.

06:37.567 --> 06:41.003
To the Wonderlic.

06:41.070 --> 06:42.571
You guys ever been Wonderlic'd?

06:42.639 --> 06:44.873
Susanna's giving away entirely
too much of her tips.

06:44.941 --> 06:46.875
Kevin, you're still on Susanna?

06:46.943 --> 06:48.076
Yeah.

06:48.145 --> 06:50.479
Can I have another pencil?

06:50.547 --> 06:52.914
The Wilson family has
an eating disorder.

06:52.982 --> 06:55.217
Joan's coat cost... Just shut up.
Just shut up.

06:55.285 --> 06:56.752
Who wants some shots?

06:56.819 --> 06:59.188
♪ ♪

07:06.829 --> 07:07.996
All right.

07:08.064 --> 07:09.731
"Begin on the next page."

07:09.799 --> 07:10.932
One down.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.770
Good job, Taco.

07:14.837 --> 07:17.206
Well... Ruxin ate one of my answers.

07:17.274 --> 07:18.607
(bell dings)

07:18.675 --> 07:19.841
All right, time's up.

07:19.909 --> 07:21.043
Hand 'em over. All done.

07:21.110 --> 07:22.244
Hand 'em over.

07:22.312 --> 07:23.245
Thank you very much.

07:23.313 --> 07:24.446
Kevin, please.

07:24.514 --> 07:25.614
Hold on.

07:25.682 --> 07:26.615
Thank you very much.

07:26.683 --> 07:28.717
I just have to do the one problem!

07:28.785 --> 07:29.918
Yup, we're all set.

07:29.986 --> 07:30.919
Let me... Oh, come on!

07:30.987 --> 07:31.920
All right, guys.

07:31.988 --> 07:33.922
Congratulations. You just
completed the Wonderlic.

07:33.990 --> 07:34.923
Oh, God.

07:34.991 --> 07:35.957
Read 'em and weep, gentlemen.

07:36.025 --> 07:39.361
As you can see, somebody
named Pete... Oh.

07:39.429 --> 07:40.362
...is the smartest.

07:40.430 --> 07:41.363
I don't know who that is.

07:41.431 --> 07:43.566
We have Andre in second, Ruxin
came in third, and then we have

07:43.633 --> 07:45.734
the McAsterisks brothers tied for last.

07:45.802 --> 07:46.935
Yeah. Brother.

07:47.003 --> 07:48.136
Oh, can you...?

07:48.205 --> 07:49.371
Don't touch me.

07:49.439 --> 07:50.573
Yeah.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.308
Not surprised I came in
third, 'cause I was totally

07:52.375 --> 07:53.242
goofing around the whole time.

07:53.310 --> 07:54.243
Really?

07:54.311 --> 07:55.244
Mm-hmm.

07:55.312 --> 07:56.245
Goofing around.

07:56.313 --> 07:58.247
Let's take a look at that test here.

07:58.315 --> 08:00.249
Yeah, you really didn't care at
all about this one, did you?

08:00.317 --> 08:02.084
Just a little bit of
tinkering on the Wonderlic?

08:02.151 --> 08:02.951
Are you kidding me?

08:03.019 --> 08:04.953
These tests don't prove anything.

08:05.021 --> 08:07.956
Standardized tests are bullshit,
and this one... Yeah.

08:08.024 --> 08:08.824
...particularly is biased.

08:08.891 --> 08:10.759
Oh, biased, what, against lawyers?

08:10.827 --> 08:12.761
Well, it may be so, because
Kevin tied with Taco.

08:12.829 --> 08:14.663
Mm. In his defense, I am pretty wasted.

08:14.731 --> 08:15.664
You know what?

08:15.732 --> 08:17.899
You can't just come into a bar
and spring a test on someone.

08:17.967 --> 08:18.900
I wasn't prepared.

08:18.968 --> 08:21.570
I sentence you to stupidity.

08:21.638 --> 08:22.738
For life.

08:22.805 --> 08:23.939
Now that's a judge face.

08:24.006 --> 08:26.342
I got to get out of
here, guys, all right?

08:26.409 --> 08:27.576
Oh, poor Kev.

08:27.644 --> 08:29.945
Good luck finding your way home, Kev.

08:30.012 --> 08:31.747
Guys, I want to do something
special for Kevin at this

08:31.814 --> 08:32.681
fund-raiser. You have any ideas?

08:32.749 --> 08:33.682
Yeah, what if we...?

08:33.750 --> 08:35.683
Aah. Pete, you're a
really smart person.

08:35.751 --> 08:36.684
Do you have any ideas?

08:36.753 --> 08:38.687
Well, maybe we could donate
an ice sculpture in his name.

08:38.755 --> 08:39.688
That would be nice.

08:39.756 --> 08:40.922
Yeah.

08:40.990 --> 08:41.857
Oh, I like that.

08:41.924 --> 08:42.691
Let's do that, yeah.

08:42.759 --> 08:44.926
Wow. That's the best idea ever.

08:44.994 --> 08:45.794
That was literally my idea.

08:45.862 --> 08:46.762
I was about to say that.

08:46.829 --> 08:48.930
Yeah, sure you were, dumb-dumb.

08:48.998 --> 08:50.832
I was. In fact, I know a guy
who makes ice sculptures.

08:50.900 --> 08:51.833
I can get this done.

08:51.901 --> 08:53.034
Okay, you can help.

08:53.102 --> 08:55.271
Got to throw him a bone
every once in a while.

08:55.338 --> 08:56.472
That's nice of you.

08:56.539 --> 08:57.673
Nice.

08:57.741 --> 08:59.841
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.
I'm out of here.

08:59.909 --> 09:00.842
Car's in the back, Ruxin.

09:00.910 --> 09:02.043
Oh, shit on a bum!

09:02.111 --> 09:03.279
Just kidding.

09:03.346 --> 09:04.480
It's in the front.

09:04.547 --> 09:06.448
Oh! Bum shit's on me!

09:06.516 --> 09:08.651
And the thing with this
Wonderlic test was not that the

09:08.718 --> 09:11.287
questions were so hard, but
they were terribly-worded.

09:11.354 --> 09:14.623
One of them was, like, "Randolph
Scott, eight pairs of pants,

09:14.691 --> 09:19.495
four shirts and six ties-- how
many days can he wear an outfit

09:19.562 --> 09:20.729
without repeating the same one?"

09:20.797 --> 09:22.063
192 days.

09:22.131 --> 09:24.065
Eight times six times four.

09:24.133 --> 09:26.502
Maybe, but you know, probably not.

09:26.569 --> 09:28.870
There were harder ones than that.

09:28.938 --> 09:31.307
I mean, they even went as
far as to make up words.

09:31.374 --> 09:32.508
How many pints in a peck?

09:32.575 --> 09:33.709
That's not even real.

09:33.777 --> 09:34.876
What's a peck?

09:34.944 --> 09:36.077
A peck is two gallons.

09:36.145 --> 09:37.078
No, it's not, sweetheart.

09:37.146 --> 09:38.314
You're wrong.

09:38.381 --> 09:39.515
Mm, she's right.

09:39.582 --> 09:41.517
No, she's not. She's wrong,
and it's okay to be wrong.

09:41.584 --> 09:42.718
I mean, look.

09:42.786 --> 09:43.752
She's scratching her head.

09:43.820 --> 09:44.986
She's confused.

09:45.054 --> 09:46.188
Actually, it itches.

09:46.255 --> 09:47.389
Let me look.

09:47.457 --> 09:48.590
Oh, my... Oh!

09:48.658 --> 09:49.758
What?

09:49.826 --> 09:50.992
Oh, she has lice.

09:51.060 --> 09:52.194
Oh, my God!

09:52.261 --> 09:54.396
Ugh! I'm gonna take
her to Dr. Levinson.

09:54.464 --> 09:56.598
What is he gonna do--
shave off half her head?

09:56.666 --> 09:57.599
You got to get her out!

09:57.667 --> 09:58.600
You're gonna kick her out?

09:58.668 --> 10:01.770
We have other kids to look after...
and food.

10:09.834 --> 10:11.326
Look, I need your help with something.

10:11.446 --> 10:12.217
Workman's comp?

10:12.330 --> 10:14.465
No, this is a
commissioner-related issue.

10:14.532 --> 10:16.278
Oh! Came to the commissioner.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.750
Well, then, you came
to the right place.

10:18.870 --> 10:20.004
Look, I made a mistake.

10:20.071 --> 10:23.607
Picked up the Philly D., planned on
dropping Detroit running back Kevin Smith.

10:23.674 --> 10:24.808
Uh-huh.

10:24.876 --> 10:27.011
Accidentally dropped Carolina
superstar Steve Smith.

10:27.078 --> 10:28.245
Mm-hmm.

10:28.313 --> 10:31.248
Obviously, this was a mistake, so as the
commissioner, I could use your help

10:31.316 --> 10:33.250
overturning this, because
whoever has first priority on

10:33.318 --> 10:35.352
the waiver tomorrow is
gonna scoop him up.

10:35.420 --> 10:36.353
Look, we all make mistakes.

10:36.421 --> 10:38.789
Like, me-- I made a boneheaded
mistake on that test, so if I

10:38.856 --> 10:41.191
took that Wonderlic test right
now, I think I'd ace it.

10:41.259 --> 10:43.593
You realize what's happening here.

10:43.661 --> 10:45.996
Your identity is so tied up with
being the smartest person in the

10:46.064 --> 10:48.365
group that you are turning
yourself into a dumb-dumb.

10:48.433 --> 10:49.599
I am not a dumb-dumb, Pete.

10:49.667 --> 10:50.801
I'm highly intelligent.

10:50.868 --> 10:52.002
I wear glasses.

10:52.070 --> 10:53.203
Really?

10:53.271 --> 10:54.371
Mm-hmm.

10:54.439 --> 10:56.807
So you're just as sharp
and quick as ever?

10:56.874 --> 10:58.008
Yeah.

10:58.076 --> 11:00.210
Well, if that's the case,
then, I think I'm just gonna

11:00.278 --> 11:05.816
head on over to Kevin's, and, uh, we're
gonna munch down on some sausages.

11:07.452 --> 11:08.552
Time's up! You see?

11:08.619 --> 11:09.786
Ah.

11:09.854 --> 11:13.390
You should have been on that like Pete's...
BOTH: ...on Kevin! Yes!

11:13.458 --> 11:17.027
Both of those homophobic quips
were on the tip of my tongue.

11:17.095 --> 11:20.397
You're a super, well-intentioned
dummy like Fredo.

11:20.465 --> 11:21.631
I'm not Fredo, okay?

11:21.699 --> 11:22.833
I've seen <i>Scarface</i> before.

11:22.900 --> 11:23.834
I know how that movie ends.

11:23.901 --> 11:24.835
You mean <i>Scarfather?</i>

11:24.902 --> 11:25.836
<i>Scarfather.</i> Exactly.

11:25.903 --> 11:26.837
Except it's <i>Godfather.</i>

11:26.904 --> 11:27.838
<i>Godfather!</i>

11:27.905 --> 11:28.839
<i>You're in real trouble here.</i>

11:28.906 --> 11:31.475
<i>My brain just feels like one
of those Gymborees filled with</i>

11:31.542 --> 11:35.079
<i>fun balls, and there's kids pissing
all over the place right now.</i>

11:35.146 --> 11:37.081
<i>Maybe you should talk to
somebody with experience, like,</i>

11:37.148 --> 11:38.315
<i>call Taco.</i>

11:38.383 --> 11:39.483
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

11:39.550 --> 11:40.484
<i>Taco, the ice sculpture.</i>

11:40.551 --> 11:41.685
<i>I got to go here.</i>

11:41.752 --> 11:42.886
<i>Ow! Aah!</i>

11:42.954 --> 11:44.088
<i>Okay.</i>

11:44.155 --> 11:45.322
<i>Caught a nard.</i>

11:45.390 --> 11:46.490
<i>Garage is not that way.</i>

11:46.557 --> 11:48.892
<i>I know where the garage is, Pete.</i>

11:48.960 --> 11:50.094
<i>I was just kidding.</i>

11:50.161 --> 11:54.031
<i>I needed something from the
kitchen before I left.</i>

11:54.099 --> 11:55.199
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

11:55.266 --> 11:57.567
<i>This is an ice sculpture of Kevin.</i>

11:57.635 --> 12:00.004
<i>No. This is half of an ice sculpture.</i>

12:00.071 --> 12:02.406
<i>Oh, I told them, I wanted
Kevin, but half the size, and I</i>

12:02.474 --> 12:04.774
<i>guess they confused that and
just gave me half of Kevin.</i>

12:04.842 --> 12:05.976
<i>Don't blame other people.</i>

12:06.044 --> 12:07.011
<i>I put you in charge of this.</i>

12:07.078 --> 12:09.213
<i>You even got the bottom half wrong.</i>

12:09.280 --> 12:11.415
<i>I told you the cock bulge
should be left-leaning.</i>

12:11.483 --> 12:12.416
<i>I thought I wrote that down.</i>

12:12.484 --> 12:14.584
<i>Geez, you're a stupid, stupid man!</i>

12:14.652 --> 12:16.586
<i>It's just, I think I got a lot
on my plate with work and</i>

12:16.654 --> 12:18.588
<i>family, and Pete wants me to
do this Steve Smith thing.</i>

12:18.656 --> 12:20.590
<i>And on top of it, you
got the day wrong.</i>

12:20.658 --> 12:21.591
<i>I told you, tomorrow, not today!</i>

12:21.659 --> 12:24.594
<i>Where am I supposed to store an
ice sculpture overnight downtown?</i>

12:24.662 --> 12:27.031
<i>What if you... 
Eh!</i>

12:27.098 --> 12:29.433
<i>No, but if...
Eh!</i>

12:29.501 --> 12:32.469
<i>Look, I... I'll deal
with this on my own.</i>

12:32.537 --> 12:34.471
<i>Taco, I could just...
Just get out of the way!</i>

12:34.539 --> 12:35.472
<i>I can figure this out.</i>

12:35.540 --> 12:37.474
<i>I can help, but... You
know how you can help?</i>

12:37.542 --> 12:39.476
<i>By shutting your mouth and
breathing through your nose once</i>

12:39.544 --> 12:40.710
<i>in a while.</i>

12:40.778 --> 12:41.645
<i>I'm not a mouth-breather.</i>

12:41.712 --> 12:42.479
<i>I'm not like Eli.</i>

12:42.547 --> 12:43.480
<i>Shut up, you idiot!</i>

12:43.548 --> 12:44.481
<i>I'm not dumb!</i>

12:44.549 --> 12:45.482
<i>I'm a smart person!</i>

12:45.550 --> 12:46.716
<i>What?</i>

12:46.784 --> 12:47.717
It's from <i>The Scarfather.</i>

12:47.785 --> 12:48.752
<i>The Godfather!</i> Aah!

12:48.819 --> 12:51.155
I just don't think this is a good idea.

12:51.222 --> 12:53.390
Oh, I just need you to keep
it here for one night.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.559
My birdbrain lawyer
messed up the dates.

12:55.626 --> 12:56.760
Just so weird.

12:56.827 --> 12:59.163
All right, let me ask you this.

12:59.230 --> 13:01.598
How do you feel about
unconventional pornography?

13:01.666 --> 13:03.833
I work in a morgue.

13:03.901 --> 13:07.471
Well, I've got a homemade porno here only
seen by a handful of people about the

13:07.539 --> 13:10.174
adventures of Dr. Andre No-Dick.

13:10.241 --> 13:12.576
You mean this doctor really has...
no dick?

13:12.643 --> 13:15.011
If he does, I haven't found it.

13:15.080 --> 13:16.180
Oh, let me see.

13:16.247 --> 13:17.414
Do we have a deal?

13:17.482 --> 13:18.582
Deal.

13:18.649 --> 13:19.783
All right!

13:19.850 --> 13:22.186
Feel free to upload
that wherever you want.

13:22.253 --> 13:24.188
Okay.

13:24.255 --> 13:25.422
Who's in here?

13:25.490 --> 13:27.791
That was that motorcycle accident.

13:27.858 --> 13:28.992
Awesome!

13:29.060 --> 13:31.428
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

13:31.496 --> 13:33.597
I'm gonna need a few more of these.

13:33.664 --> 13:35.999
Oh, I can't believe
we're Eskimo brothers.

13:36.067 --> 13:38.535
Movie night.

13:41.072 --> 13:42.206
Good impressions.

13:42.273 --> 13:43.440
Good impressions.

13:43.508 --> 13:45.609
Positive energy, good impressions.

13:45.676 --> 13:48.812
Yup. We are not gonna talk about
our lice-infested daughter.

13:48.879 --> 13:49.813
Okay. Ah, Judge Hobart.

13:49.880 --> 13:50.814
Hey, McArthur.

13:50.881 --> 13:51.815
This is my wife, Jenny.

13:51.882 --> 13:54.718
Ah. I am so excited about Ryan
Fitzpatrick speaking tonight.

13:54.785 --> 13:55.719
Oh, me, too.

13:55.786 --> 13:58.688
Oh, I'm sorry. Ryan Fitzpatrick-- he's
the, uh, quarterback for the Buffalo

13:58.756 --> 13:59.889
Bills?

13:59.957 --> 14:01.891
Two TDs and 240 yards last week?

14:01.959 --> 14:03.660
I can't wait to meet him.

14:03.728 --> 14:08.898
But... what is important is that he cares
about a cause as vital as education.

14:08.966 --> 14:10.967
Well, I wish he cared as much
about throwing to Stevie

14:11.035 --> 14:13.504
Johnson, 'cause that
dude is killing me.

14:13.571 --> 14:15.705
Thank you... Thank you.

14:15.773 --> 14:16.706
I was speaking frankly.

14:16.774 --> 14:17.707
Too frank.

14:17.775 --> 14:19.876
Kevin! Ta-da!

14:19.944 --> 14:20.910
What is this?

14:20.978 --> 14:21.911
It's you.

14:21.979 --> 14:22.912
This is not me.

14:22.980 --> 14:25.516
No, I know the crotch is all
wrong-- it's way too centered.

14:25.583 --> 14:26.550
It should be... right over here.

14:26.618 --> 14:28.552
No, no. It's missing... the top.

14:28.620 --> 14:29.553
That's not my fault, okay?

14:29.621 --> 14:30.554
Ruxin was in charge of this.

14:30.622 --> 14:31.555
That guy's such an idiot.

14:31.623 --> 14:33.557
Do you guys smell something weird?

14:33.625 --> 14:35.992
Oh. Ruxin had it delivered
yesterday, so I had to leave it

14:36.060 --> 14:36.993
at the morgue overnight.

14:37.061 --> 14:37.994
Th-The morgue?

14:38.062 --> 14:38.828
Yeah.

14:38.896 --> 14:40.830
So this smell is in fact death?

14:40.898 --> 14:43.667
Not the moment of death-- that
doesn't smell like anything.

14:43.734 --> 14:45.769
It's the bodies decomposing
as a result of death.

14:45.836 --> 14:47.003
Taco, what the hell is that?

14:47.071 --> 14:48.004
That's a toe tag.

14:48.072 --> 14:50.006
So that they can identify it as mine.

14:50.074 --> 14:51.007
Okay. Thank you.

14:51.075 --> 14:53.843
What... W... No, no,
please stop talking.

14:53.911 --> 14:55.212
Oh, man.

14:55.280 --> 14:56.246
(exhales sharply)

14:56.314 --> 14:57.247
(exhales sharply)

14:57.315 --> 14:59.516
There's dumb and then
there's just plain stupid.

14:59.584 --> 15:03.253
But, look, Andre's really hitting it
off with Hobart, so that's great.

15:03.321 --> 15:06.356
My God, I never thought I'd say
this, but thank God for Andre.

15:06.424 --> 15:09.092
Why is he itching like a maniac?

15:09.160 --> 15:10.694
God... he has lice.

15:10.761 --> 15:11.528
No!

15:11.596 --> 15:12.529
Ellie gave him lice.

15:12.597 --> 15:13.530
No!

15:13.598 --> 15:14.531
We have to say something.

15:14.599 --> 15:16.533
Well, we can't tell him tonight.

15:16.601 --> 15:18.368
He's gonna give lice to everybody.

15:18.436 --> 15:19.369
We have to tell him.

15:19.437 --> 15:21.371
You are going to keep
your judge face on.

15:21.439 --> 15:22.439
Judge face.

15:22.507 --> 15:23.607
Oh, hey! Look at this.

15:23.675 --> 15:24.774
Oh, God, they're coming over.

15:24.842 --> 15:27.477
Hey, hey! What's going on?

15:27.545 --> 15:28.712
Yeah.

15:28.779 --> 15:30.647
Judge Hobart is the man.

15:30.715 --> 15:31.781
No, this guy is a hoot.

15:31.849 --> 15:32.782
'Course he is.

15:32.850 --> 15:33.617
Yes, he is.

15:33.685 --> 15:35.619
Did you know Hobart
plays a little squash?

15:35.687 --> 15:36.620
I'm gonna tear this guy up.

15:36.688 --> 15:38.622
Well, I'm gonna judge you on the court.

15:38.690 --> 15:40.224
Come on, come on, grr!

15:40.291 --> 15:41.625
(all chuckling)

15:41.693 --> 15:45.128
Oh!

15:45.196 --> 15:47.397
Oh!

15:47.465 --> 15:48.465
Oh, man.

15:48.533 --> 15:49.499
Hey, Judge Hobart.

15:49.567 --> 15:54.404
I-I just... I have to tell you, you...
at this point, probably... Excuse us.

15:54.472 --> 15:55.405
Excuse us, please.

15:55.473 --> 15:56.240
Sure.

15:56.307 --> 15:58.242
They don't get out
much-- they have kids.

15:58.309 --> 16:01.077
Judge face... Hey, hey,
hey, where is Ruxin?

16:01.145 --> 16:02.412
He has not given me Steve Smith.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.680
It was an accidental drop.

16:03.748 --> 16:06.182
A drop is a drop, Steve Smith is mine.

16:06.251 --> 16:08.985
Oh, God, why did I teach you
how to use the waiver wire?

16:09.053 --> 16:10.987
Sorry I'm late, I was distracted.

16:11.055 --> 16:12.822
Ruxin, you didn't undo the drop.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.824
I couldn't figure out
how to make it work.

16:14.892 --> 16:15.859
I'm new at commissioner.

16:15.926 --> 16:17.461
You can't undo a drop, Pete.

16:17.528 --> 16:18.662
Will you just live with it?

16:18.730 --> 16:19.696
It was a mistake, Jenny.

16:19.764 --> 16:21.698
Yeah, you're too smart
to make a mistake.

16:21.766 --> 16:22.799
You're not an idiot like Ruxin.

16:22.867 --> 16:24.801
Ruxin, an impartial judgment, please.

16:24.869 --> 16:25.802
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:25.870 --> 16:26.803
Is this about the... What?

16:26.871 --> 16:28.639
Is this about the add/drop thing?

16:28.706 --> 16:31.441
'Cause I'm playing Pete this
week, and, uh, I kind of want it

16:31.509 --> 16:33.677
to stand, so... Kevin, a
little judgment, please?

16:33.745 --> 16:35.445
No. I am not a commissioner.

16:35.513 --> 16:37.814
I am going to be a judge, and if
you're not very nice to me, I'm

16:37.882 --> 16:39.816
gonna send you all
away to jail for life.

16:39.884 --> 16:40.817
Ruxin, just make a decision.

16:40.885 --> 16:42.819
Really? We're gonna let
this mouth-breather decide?

16:42.887 --> 16:44.655
Uh... I know what I'm doing!

16:44.722 --> 16:46.657
I just need five minutes to debilitate.

16:46.724 --> 16:47.658
Deliberate?

16:47.725 --> 16:49.493
Deliberate, that's
what I was gonna say.

16:49.560 --> 16:50.494
Which way's the lobby?

16:50.561 --> 16:51.495
To your left.

16:51.562 --> 16:52.329
Okay.

16:52.397 --> 16:53.330
Your other left.

16:53.398 --> 16:54.464
Yes!

16:54.532 --> 16:56.466
I'll be back... Embarrassing.

16:56.534 --> 16:58.302
You know what, I better
head to the bathroom.

16:58.369 --> 16:59.569
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:59.637 --> 17:01.672
This party is boring, and you
probably don't want to be here

17:01.739 --> 17:03.674
anymore, so you should
just, you know, take off.

17:03.741 --> 17:05.675
Oh, no, no, no, no, I get
what you're trying to do.

17:05.742 --> 17:08.679
You don't want me to be around for the
resolution of this add/drop thing.

17:08.746 --> 17:12.749
No, no, I'm not going anywhere, and I'm
gonna stick to you like white on rice.

17:12.817 --> 17:15.242
All right, good to see you both.

17:15.551 --> 17:16.991
Oh, my God.

17:17.111 --> 17:17.919
He is covered.

17:18.039 --> 17:20.156
He's sticking to us like white on lice.

17:27.940 --> 17:28.706
Where is he?

17:28.774 --> 17:32.544
(Ruxin singing scales)

17:32.664 --> 17:34.726
Your commissioner has arrived.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.514
Did you join a choir or something?

17:36.582 --> 17:38.682
It's a judge's robe I found
in the other room so I could

17:38.750 --> 17:39.817
look smart and imposing.

17:39.884 --> 17:40.818
Very effective.

17:40.885 --> 17:41.885
Except it's on backwards.

17:41.953 --> 17:43.854
What? No, it's not.

17:43.922 --> 17:44.855
(chuckling)

17:44.923 --> 17:45.856
I hate this.

17:45.924 --> 17:48.826
I thought dumb people were
supposed to be happy.

17:48.893 --> 17:51.129
It's complicated.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.531
(Muzak playing)

17:56.368 --> 18:00.571
Ah. Eh, eh.

18:00.639 --> 18:01.639
No.

18:01.706 --> 18:04.175
Oh... Oh!

18:04.243 --> 18:06.010
(shrieks)

18:06.077 --> 18:07.044
Lice.

18:07.112 --> 18:10.214
Well, this ruling comes down from
the Office of the Commissioner.

18:10.282 --> 18:12.350
Office? I thought you were
pretending to be in <i>Sister Act.</i>

18:12.417 --> 18:14.352
<i>There's some big words on...
No, I know all the words.</i>

18:14.419 --> 18:15.353
<i>Holy shit. Ryan Fitzpatrick.</i>

18:15.420 --> 18:16.354
<i>Sorry... I'm Pete.</i>

18:16.421 --> 18:17.355
<i>I'm a huge fan.</i>

18:17.422 --> 18:19.323
<i>Could I buy you a beer
and we could be friends?</i>

18:19.391 --> 18:21.192
<i>I-I'm just gonna have a quick soda.</i>

18:21.260 --> 18:22.193
<i>I've got to do a speech tonight.</i>

18:22.261 --> 18:25.429
<i>Oh, I'll take a Dark and Stormy
and, uh, some kind of sandwich.</i>

18:25.497 --> 18:27.665
<i>Actually, you know what,
Ryan, if you don't mind just</i>

18:27.732 --> 18:29.900
<i>listening to this ruling, since
you're a professional football</i>

18:29.968 --> 18:31.902
<i>player and I'm a
professional commissioner.</i>

18:31.970 --> 18:33.704
<i>I think you'll enjoy this.</i>

18:33.772 --> 18:36.607
<i>Uh, this is the ruling
of Ruxin, Pete v. Taco.</i>

18:36.675 --> 18:40.077
<i>Now, while I wear these judge's
robes, I am actually for all</i>

18:40.145 --> 18:42.613
<i>intensive purposes, the judge and jury.</i>

18:42.681 --> 18:43.914
<i>Uh... I'm sorry to interrupt</i>

18:43.982 --> 18:47.351
<i>you, but it's with "all
intents and purposes."</i>

18:47.419 --> 18:48.352
<i>Isn't that what I said?</i>

18:48.420 --> 18:50.354
<i>No, you said "intensive purposes."</i>

18:50.422 --> 18:51.522
<i>I've heard both parties'</i>

18:51.590 --> 18:54.525
<i>arguments, and, frankly,
I could care less.</i>

18:54.593 --> 18:56.194
<i>It's "I couldn't care less."</i>

18:56.261 --> 18:58.429
<i>You basically just said the
opposite of what you meant.</i>

18:58.497 --> 19:01.566
<i>Oh, so, like, for example,
"Thanks for interjecting."</i>

19:01.633 --> 19:02.900
<i>(clears throat) Okay.</i>

19:02.967 --> 19:04.968
<i>Oh! Turkey. On rye.</i>

19:05.036 --> 19:07.305
<i>Look, the question is in this
particular case whether Pete's</i>

19:07.372 --> 19:10.408
<i>dropping of Steve Smith was
an accident or was a tactical</i>

19:10.475 --> 19:11.576
<i>blunder.</i>

19:11.643 --> 19:14.111
<i>I would argue that it's
really all one in the same.</i>

19:14.179 --> 19:15.580
<i>Yeah, oh, what now, Ryan?</i>

19:15.647 --> 19:17.781
<i>I think you mean "one and</i> the same."

19:17.849 --> 19:18.949
God, you're so smart, man.

19:19.017 --> 19:20.984
You know, your robe's on backwards.

19:21.052 --> 19:25.756
It's not on backwards, it just... It fits b...
I can... Oh, you look so stupid.

19:25.824 --> 19:26.790
You know what?

19:26.858 --> 19:28.926
If you're so smart, what'd you
get on the Wonderlic test?

19:28.993 --> 19:29.927
Like, a 16?

19:29.994 --> 19:30.928
48 out of 50.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.763
How many days did that take you?

19:32.831 --> 19:33.764
About nine minutes.

19:33.832 --> 19:35.766
Ryan, it was under nine
minutes-- don't be modest.

19:35.834 --> 19:36.767
You set the record.

19:36.835 --> 19:39.770
Oh, well, I guess I just didn't take that
many standardized tests when I was at

19:39.838 --> 19:42.072
Northwestern, but... probably
at the community college you

19:42.140 --> 19:44.074
crawled out of, it was
a different deal, huh?

19:44.142 --> 19:45.075
I went to Harvard.

19:45.143 --> 19:45.976
Huh! Harvard?!

19:46.044 --> 19:48.078
I can't believe you didn't
know he went to Harvard.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.913
I just forgot that he went to Harvard.

19:49.981 --> 19:50.914
What an idiot.

19:50.982 --> 19:51.915
I'm not an idiot!

19:51.983 --> 19:54.518
I have a dearth of knowledge
about a lot of different things!

19:54.586 --> 19:56.654
Okay, Whoopi Goldberg,
"dearth" means "lack of."

19:56.722 --> 19:58.656
I'm about to give you
a dearth of teeth!

19:58.724 --> 20:00.658
Dearth of teeth or lack of teeth?

20:00.726 --> 20:02.660
Oh, you mother... Dearth Vader, no!

20:02.728 --> 20:03.661
Overall, not that bad.

20:03.729 --> 20:04.662
It was good.

20:04.730 --> 20:06.196
Oh, hi, guys.

20:06.265 --> 20:07.865
<i>Lice</i> to meet you. Yeah, I know.

20:07.932 --> 20:09.700
Your terrible daughter gave me lice.

20:09.768 --> 20:10.701
Okay, all right, calm down.

20:10.769 --> 20:11.702
Let me ask you a question.

20:11.770 --> 20:12.703
How did you two not get it?

20:12.771 --> 20:14.639
Look at you, you're like an animal.

20:14.706 --> 20:15.673
You're <i>Teen Wolf</i> over here.

20:15.741 --> 20:16.674
Okay, just relax, Andre.

20:16.742 --> 20:18.509
Guess what I'm gonna have to do now.

20:18.577 --> 20:21.345
I'm gonna have to shave my head, and
people are gonna think that I'm bald now.

20:21.413 --> 20:23.046
Now you could admit that you're bald.

20:23.114 --> 20:23.981
Yes.

20:24.048 --> 20:28.118
If I was bald, I couldn't have lice,
because lice are in my clear hair!

20:28.186 --> 20:29.287
Can you stop yelling "lice"

20:29.354 --> 20:30.321
and "hair," please?

20:30.389 --> 20:32.723
Yeah, then you just
admit that I have hair.

20:32.791 --> 20:35.225
Fine, you have beautiful,
luxurious, flowing clear hair.

20:35.294 --> 20:38.228
No, I don't want to hear it from
you; I want to hear it from her!

20:38.297 --> 20:40.331
Come on... Out! I want him out of here.

20:40.399 --> 20:41.165
Out!

20:41.232 --> 20:43.367
De-hand me! De-hand me!

20:43.435 --> 20:45.636
I'm the smartest guy in the league.

20:45.704 --> 20:47.338
J-Just want to take the
test one more time!

20:47.458 --> 20:49.144
I took a prep course! I aced it!

20:49.264 --> 20:50.295
I'm on Ritalin!

20:50.415 --> 20:53.143
Hey. One of your asshole
League of Extraordinary

20:53.211 --> 20:55.145
Shitsippers just took a
swing at Ryan Fitzpatrick.

20:55.213 --> 20:56.980
I had nothing to do with that.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.685
I want you out of here. Gone.

20:58.805 --> 21:00.380
God, why am I itching?

21:00.500 --> 21:02.038
That would be the lice.

21:03.166 --> 21:13.669
