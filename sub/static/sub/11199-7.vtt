00:22.035 --> 00:25.527
- What the hell are you doin'?
- I was trying to park.

00:26.673 --> 00:29.198
- Did you ever hear of signaling, pal?
- I did signal.

00:29.276 --> 00:33.178
Listen. If you don't know how to drive,
maybe you should try staying off the road!

00:33.246 --> 00:36.374
Maybe if you hadn't been tailgating me,
this wouldn't have happened.

00:41.154 --> 00:42.883
You didn't just say that.

00:42.956 --> 00:46.187
Look, man,
I don't want any trouble.

00:46.259 --> 00:48.727
Too late.

00:51.498 --> 00:55.867
- This is unlawful behavior.
- Who the hell are you?

00:55.936 --> 00:58.871
Collision procedure dictates that
you exchange insurance information...

00:58.939 --> 01:01.430
and, if necessary,
notify the police.

01:01.508 --> 01:03.942
What?

01:04.845 --> 01:07.370
This gentleman did indeed signal,
which would indicate...

01:07.447 --> 01:09.881
that it was you who was at fault.

01:09.950 --> 01:13.044
Pal, you better learn to
mind your own damn business.

01:42.315 --> 01:45.478
I believe it will now be necessary
to notify the police.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.320
Yeah. Thanks.

03:03.063 --> 03:04.655
Sir?

03:06.366 --> 03:11.326
Colonel Kendrick from the Office of
Special Investigations is here to see you.

03:11.404 --> 03:13.668
Does he have an appointment?

03:13.740 --> 03:17.073
- No, sir.
- You wouldn't return my phone calls, sir.

03:17.978 --> 03:22.005
I was busy. Didn't think it was important.
Take your pick.

03:22.082 --> 03:24.642
You know as well as I do
there's been another incident.

03:24.718 --> 03:27.812
When you petitioned the OSI
to allow Teal'c to live off-base...

03:27.888 --> 03:29.822
your request was approved
under certain provisions.

03:29.890 --> 03:32.586
These provisions
have clearly been violated.

03:32.659 --> 03:35.025
Come on, Colonel.

03:35.095 --> 03:38.223
If you had saved Earth from
total annihilation a couple of times...

03:38.298 --> 03:40.596
and your government told you
you couldn't go out to play...

03:41.668 --> 03:46.264
wouldn't you consider it
more a guideline than a rule?

03:46.339 --> 03:50.070
We all appreciate what Teal'c has done
for us, sir, on numerous occasions.

03:50.143 --> 03:52.077
But that doesn't change the fact
that he's a liability.

03:52.145 --> 03:56.172
Every day he's allowed to roam around in
public, it jeopardizes national security.

03:56.249 --> 03:59.446
Don't be so dramatic, Dick.
It'll give you gas.

03:59.519 --> 04:04.957
Well, either you take action to ensure
these provisions are met, or the OSI will.

04:05.025 --> 04:07.755
Hey, watch it.

04:12.532 --> 04:13.965
I'll look into it.

04:15.769 --> 04:18.397
Yes, sir.

04:29.649 --> 04:31.708
I wanted to come by
and see how you're settling in.

04:31.785 --> 04:33.218
Please enter.

04:37.257 --> 04:39.725
Wow. I like what
you're doin' with the place.

04:39.793 --> 04:44.730
Sort ofJaffa chic
with a East African flair.

04:44.798 --> 04:47.266
I have discovered there are
many programs on television...

04:47.334 --> 04:50.269
which offer advice in the area
of home design and decoration.

04:50.337 --> 04:52.737
I'm a little more into
the History Channel myself.

04:54.307 --> 04:55.740
Can I offer you anything?

04:55.809 --> 04:59.643
No, I'm fine.
How's the fern doing?

05:08.655 --> 05:10.623
I don't suppose
you've tried talking to it?

05:11.658 --> 05:13.091
I have not.

05:15.395 --> 05:17.192
Perhaps you should tell me
why you are here.

05:19.432 --> 05:22.799
A guy just can't come by
and visit his friend?

05:27.974 --> 05:30.807
Yep. Heard what happened the other day.
Three KO's, first round.

05:32.278 --> 05:34.109
O'Neill sent you to speak with me.

05:34.180 --> 05:37.115
No. Yeah.

05:37.183 --> 05:39.117
I broke no law.

05:39.185 --> 05:42.951
I intervened to prevent a criminal
activity and was forced to defend myself.

05:43.023 --> 05:44.786
That's kind of the point.

05:44.858 --> 05:46.951
There's no reason you shouldn't
be allowed to live off-base...

05:47.027 --> 05:49.860
especially when you're not
carrying a symbiote anymore.

05:49.929 --> 05:52.227
But you're supposed to be
keeping a low profile.

05:52.298 --> 05:55.495
- That is not always easy.
- I'm not just talking about the tattoo.

05:55.568 --> 05:58.366
Although, I do see how
that could be a problem.

05:58.438 --> 06:00.906
I often cover it
to avoid stares in public...

06:00.974 --> 06:04.341
but I tell those who have seen it that
it is a tribal mark from my homeland.

06:04.411 --> 06:06.675
This is less about appearance
than it is about behavior.

06:06.746 --> 06:10.773
Have I not conducted myself as
a typical member of this community?

06:10.850 --> 06:13.341
No, actually.
No, you haven't.

06:13.420 --> 06:16.389
Besides the other day,
there was...

06:16.456 --> 06:19.425
the incident with the old man
and the teenagers in the park.

06:19.492 --> 06:21.517
There was that thing with
the guy with the pit bull.

06:21.594 --> 06:25.894
In each case, I was only attempting
to render assistance where it was needed.

06:25.965 --> 06:27.865
That's kind of the problem.

06:29.936 --> 06:32.029
Normal human beings
are a little more careful...

06:32.105 --> 06:34.096
about getting involved
in business that isn't theirs.

06:34.174 --> 06:37.507
I know. That sounds bad,
but it's just the way it is.

06:37.577 --> 06:41.377
And you can't afford to be
drawing attention to yourself.

06:44.217 --> 06:45.616
I understand.

06:49.189 --> 06:50.850
Excuse me.

06:58.164 --> 06:59.529
Made you cookies.

07:01.768 --> 07:03.599
Please come in.

07:06.072 --> 07:08.632
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you had company.

07:08.708 --> 07:12.200
Krista James,
this is DanielJackson.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.204
Krista lives in
the apartment next door.

07:16.583 --> 07:18.210
Wait a minute.
Dr. Jackson?

07:18.284 --> 07:21.447
You're the archaeologist who hired Teal'c
to come over from Mozambique.

07:21.521 --> 07:23.216
That's right.

07:23.289 --> 07:27.225
Well, then I should thank you.
It's been great having him here.

07:27.293 --> 07:29.227
It's nice to have a man around
who cares about his neighbors.

07:29.295 --> 07:32.162
Actually, we were
just talking about that.

07:32.232 --> 07:35.167
In fact,
that's why I'm here.

07:35.235 --> 07:39.262
The cookies were a bribe.
My pipes are doing that thing again.

07:42.242 --> 07:45.643
Normally, I would be happy
to provide assistance. However-

07:45.712 --> 07:48.840
Don't let me interrupt.
I've gotta be going anyway.

07:48.915 --> 07:52.316
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:52.385 --> 07:54.512
Teal'c, that other thing
we were talking about-

07:56.523 --> 07:59.959
Every rule has its exceptions.

08:05.799 --> 08:07.460
Thanks.

08:09.402 --> 08:11.927
So, how are things
in the galaxy?

08:12.005 --> 08:14.337
- You know I can't talk about work.
- Sorry.

08:14.407 --> 08:17.672
I'm still getting used to the fact
that my girlfriend's a superhero.

08:17.744 --> 08:19.177
A bit of an exaggeration.

08:19.245 --> 08:21.873
The "superhero" part,
or the "girlfriend" part?

08:23.483 --> 08:26.680
You travel to other planets
to do battle with alien creatures...

08:26.753 --> 08:28.914
bent on galactic domination.

08:28.988 --> 08:32.253
Just because you don't wear a tight
spandex outfit doesn't mean you're not-

08:32.325 --> 08:35.783
Although, that's an idea
you might want to consider.

08:37.430 --> 08:41.696
Look. I know
this is hard for you.

08:41.768 --> 08:44.828
I mean, any other guy
would've just freaked out and run away.

08:44.904 --> 08:48.271
You didn't run away
when I stalked you.

08:49.409 --> 08:52.742
Anyway, I just want you to appreciate
the position I'm in here.

08:52.812 --> 08:57.215
I do, believe me.
And I'm really glad you stuck around.

08:57.283 --> 08:59.410
Well, I'm glad to
hear you say that...

09:00.887 --> 09:03.378
'cause I put in for a transfer
to Colorado Springs PD.

09:10.463 --> 09:11.930
Are you sure?

09:11.998 --> 09:16.059
I've never been more sure
of anything in my entire life.

09:17.070 --> 09:19.038
That's why I got you this.

09:25.712 --> 09:27.202
Oh, my God.

09:34.921 --> 09:37.185
I'm sorry to keep asking you
to help with my plumbing...

09:37.257 --> 09:41.489
but the super's never around,
and my boyfriend's not very handy.

09:41.561 --> 09:43.995
There is no need to apologize.

09:44.063 --> 09:47.794
Anyhow, you'll forgive me
once you've tasted my lasagna.

09:47.867 --> 09:49.732
I'm looking forward to it.

09:49.802 --> 09:52.600
- Yo, T.
- Greetings, Eric.

09:52.672 --> 09:56.699
I saw you take out those three gorillas
the other day. Nice work.

09:56.776 --> 10:00.143
In retrospect,
it may have been unwise to intervene.

10:00.213 --> 10:01.942
Are you kidding?
They deserved it.

10:04.183 --> 10:07.209
Stop that guy!
He's got my purse!

10:07.287 --> 10:09.721
- Aren't you gonna do anything?
- I must not intervene.

10:09.789 --> 10:12.622
What? You're just gonna
let him get away?

10:27.874 --> 10:30.604
Oh, man!
What a shot!

10:30.677 --> 10:32.770
How did you do that?

10:32.845 --> 10:36.781
- You the man, T!
- Thank you.

10:36.849 --> 10:38.441
That was amazing.

10:40.086 --> 10:41.678
That was amazing.

10:42.922 --> 10:45.117
T-money, you are the man!

10:45.191 --> 10:47.989
Gotta give the man his props.

11:03.810 --> 11:05.471
Come on, Krista!

11:06.779 --> 11:09.577
Listen. Listen.
Listen, just let me in.

11:09.649 --> 11:12.345
- Just let me in.
- I have to work tomorrow.

11:12.418 --> 11:15.444
- So?
- So, you're drunk.

11:15.521 --> 11:18.786
- Just go home, please.
- I ain't goin' nowhere.

11:18.858 --> 11:21.622
Is there a problem?

11:21.694 --> 11:24.162
This is a private conversation.

11:24.230 --> 11:26.824
If it were private, you would not
be conducting it in the hallway...

11:26.899 --> 11:29.390
nor speaking so loudly.

11:31.270 --> 11:34.865
It's all right, Mrs. Conners.
Just go back inside.

11:40.346 --> 11:43.315
Do you require assistance?

11:43.383 --> 11:47.342
- No, I'm okay.
- Who the hell is this guy?

11:47.420 --> 11:49.752
His name is Teal'c.

11:49.822 --> 11:51.483
He's my neighbor.

11:54.260 --> 11:57.423
What kind of a crazy name is that?

11:57.497 --> 12:00.364
He just moved here
from Mozambique.

12:00.433 --> 12:02.196
No doubt.

12:02.268 --> 12:06.102
Krista has requested that you leave.
I suggest you comply.

12:06.172 --> 12:09.539
You better check yourself
before you get hurt.

12:10.877 --> 12:12.572
I have checked.

12:12.645 --> 12:16.513
I suggest you leave
before it is you that gets hurt.

12:16.582 --> 12:20.074
Doug, go sober up.

12:20.153 --> 12:24.419
You know what?
I'm gonna call you tomorrow.

12:31.964 --> 12:34.524
I'm sorry about that.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.568
I hate when he gets that way.

12:36.636 --> 12:38.968
This is not the first time?

12:40.473 --> 12:43.704
So you have stopped
receiving him.

12:43.776 --> 12:45.437
Not exactly.

12:46.579 --> 12:48.843
He's not always like that.

12:48.915 --> 12:52.407
Since he lost his job,
he's just been, you know-

12:53.853 --> 12:56.481
I do not.

12:56.556 --> 12:58.319
It's been hard on him.

12:58.391 --> 13:00.256
And has it not
been hard on you?

13:03.229 --> 13:04.628
I'm fine.

13:08.334 --> 13:11.132
<i>I do not understand</i>
<i>Krista's behavior.</i>

13:11.204 --> 13:14.765
Yeah, that's a common problem.
Most cultures on Earth recognize...

13:14.841 --> 13:16.832
a significant gap between
the experiences of men and women.

13:16.909 --> 13:19.605
Among the Masai of East Africa,
each newlywed man...

13:19.679 --> 13:21.613
is actually required to wear
his wife's clothing for a month...

13:21.681 --> 13:23.649
as a way of gaining insight
into her life.

13:23.716 --> 13:25.877
If only it were that simple.

13:25.952 --> 13:28.182
The point is, while rituals
and customs may vary...

13:28.254 --> 13:31.018
almost all cultures put pressure
on single adults to form bonding pairs.

13:31.090 --> 13:33.149
In ancient Persia...

13:33.226 --> 13:37.185
if a girl died a virgin, they would
marry her corpse off before burial.

13:37.263 --> 13:41.165
- That's horrible.
- The groom was usually quite well paid.

13:41.234 --> 13:43.668
It's bad enough being on your own
without every TV show...

13:43.736 --> 13:47.797
and commercial and magazine ad
trying to tell you how abnormal it is.

13:47.874 --> 13:50.434
- I think that's what I just said.
- They make you afraid of being alone.

13:50.510 --> 13:52.671
But at the same time, telling
you not to settle for anything less...

13:52.745 --> 13:55.475
than the perfect, romantic ideal,
like that actually exists...

13:55.548 --> 13:58.278
anywhere in the real world.

13:58.351 --> 14:01.013
Either way, you can't win.

14:02.788 --> 14:04.813
How's things?

14:04.891 --> 14:07.792
Good. We were talking
about Teal'c's friend, right?

14:07.860 --> 14:09.987
I thought we were.

14:11.764 --> 14:13.698
How doJaffa couples
handle their problems?

14:13.766 --> 14:15.996
On Chulak, a dispute between
a man and a woman...

14:16.068 --> 14:19.037
that cannot be resolved
necessitates a pledge break.

14:19.105 --> 14:21.699
It must be requested by one
and granted by the other.

14:21.774 --> 14:26.040
- And if that doesn't work?
- A weapon is required.

14:43.796 --> 14:47.493
Sorry. I don't want to interrupt you.
I just came out for a little air.

14:47.567 --> 14:48.829
Are you all right?

14:50.403 --> 14:52.337
I had another fight
with Doug.

14:52.405 --> 14:54.600
I told him it's over.
I don't wanna see him anymore.

14:54.674 --> 14:56.733
Are you not happy
with your decision?

14:57.610 --> 15:01.137
I guess it was the right thing to do.
But he's not a bad person.

15:01.214 --> 15:03.079
He's just going through
a tough time.

15:03.149 --> 15:04.946
You have no cause
to feel guilty.

15:07.820 --> 15:10.345
- What was that you were just doing?
- It is called Lok'nel.

15:10.423 --> 15:13.051
An ancient form
of martial arts training.

15:14.193 --> 15:15.683
You think you could teach me?

16:45.785 --> 16:48.015
You are late for
your next training session.

16:48.087 --> 16:51.545
I meant to tell you. I don't think I'm
gonna be able to train with you anymore.

16:52.825 --> 16:54.622
You have been making
tremendous progress.

16:54.694 --> 16:57.629
Well, I just don't have time,
you know?

16:58.631 --> 17:00.724
- Has something transpired?
- No.

17:00.800 --> 17:06.033
Everything's fine.
Look, I've gotta go.

17:09.308 --> 17:12.175
You are injured.

17:12.244 --> 17:14.906
It's nothing. Please.

17:14.980 --> 17:18.381
- Who is it?
- It's just my neighbor.

17:18.451 --> 17:22.911
Oh, yeah? The plumber.
I'll handle this.

17:22.988 --> 17:25.980
- Doug, it's-
- I said, I'll handle it.

17:33.165 --> 17:36.032
Don't think I don't know
what's been goin' on around here.

17:36.102 --> 17:39.265
- She told me everything.
- Are you the one who injured her?

17:39.338 --> 17:42.239
What goes on between me and Krista,
it ain't none of your business.

17:42.308 --> 17:46.005
If you ever injure her again...

17:47.346 --> 17:49.678
I will kill you where you stand.

18:12.104 --> 18:14.595
Sir?

18:14.673 --> 18:16.800
I never thought I'd hear myself
utter these words.

18:19.779 --> 18:21.371
I need that report.

18:23.082 --> 18:27.985
Right. I just need to
finish typing up my notes.

18:29.588 --> 18:31.385
I'll have it for you
first thing tomorrow.

18:32.792 --> 18:34.282
It is tomorrow.

18:37.296 --> 18:40.891
I'm joking.
I don't need the report.

18:40.966 --> 18:43.628
- Well, then why-
- Because something's going on with you.

18:44.937 --> 18:46.996
You haven't tried to confuse me
with any scientific babble...

18:47.072 --> 18:50.132
for the last couple of days,
and that's a red flag to me.

18:55.748 --> 18:57.739
Pete gave me this.

19:08.327 --> 19:10.488
People normally wear these
on their fingers.

19:11.630 --> 19:13.097
I haven't said "Yes."

19:14.700 --> 19:17.464
And, yet,
you haven't said "No."

19:18.771 --> 19:20.671
I told him
I needed to think about it.

19:22.208 --> 19:23.334
And?

19:25.611 --> 19:27.476
That was two weeks ago.

19:31.016 --> 19:33.280
You know, all these years,
I've been concentrating on work.

19:33.352 --> 19:35.684
- I just assumed that one day, I would-
- Have a life?

19:41.093 --> 19:44.426
Now it comes down to it,
I don't know.

19:44.497 --> 19:47.830
I mean, every time we go through the gate,
we risk not coming back.

19:47.900 --> 19:50.391
Is it fair to put
somebody else through that?

19:50.469 --> 19:53.029
Pete is a cop.
I think he could handle it.

19:55.608 --> 19:57.838
- What about kids?
- What about 'em?

19:57.910 --> 20:00.936
Do I take maternity leave
and then come back?

20:01.013 --> 20:03.072
What, do I drop the baby off
at day care on my way...

20:03.148 --> 20:05.582
to some unexplored planet
on the edge of the Crab Nebula?

20:05.651 --> 20:08.313
Carter, there are people
on this base who have families.

20:13.359 --> 20:14.758
What about you?

20:17.062 --> 20:19.826
If things had been different-

20:25.204 --> 20:26.535
I wouldn't be here.

20:43.022 --> 20:46.514
- Hey. I was waiting for you.
- Has something happened?

20:46.592 --> 20:50.187
I'm fine.
It's just-

20:50.262 --> 20:54.255
It's over with Doug.
For real this time.

20:55.334 --> 20:57.359
I'm sorry about
what happened before.

21:04.343 --> 21:06.277
I need to get out of here.

21:07.746 --> 21:10.306
I can't even think in this place.

21:13.919 --> 21:15.546
Will you come with me?

21:17.523 --> 21:20.390
- Perhaps tomorrow-
- No, now. Tonight.

21:20.459 --> 21:23.121
We'll just get in the car...

21:23.195 --> 21:25.527
and drive.

21:25.598 --> 21:27.725
We'll take the whole weekend.

21:29.735 --> 21:32.203
It doesn't even matter
where we end up...

21:33.672 --> 21:36.106
as long as it's
away from here.

21:40.579 --> 21:42.809
Please?

21:50.422 --> 21:52.947
Hey. What's goin' on?

21:54.660 --> 21:58.187
General O'Neill just got off
the phone with Colonel Kendrick.

21:58.263 --> 22:00.629
Krista's boyfriend was found
dead in her apartment.

22:00.699 --> 22:03.964
- What? What happened?
- We don't have all the details yet.

22:04.036 --> 22:06.971
But according to Kendrick,
preliminary evidence indicates...

22:07.039 --> 22:08.973
that Teal'c
may have been responsible.

22:09.041 --> 22:11.339
- That's impossible.
- That's what I said.

22:11.410 --> 22:14.004
Unfortunately, we can't ask him
about it, because he's missing.

22:14.079 --> 22:15.979
So is Krista.

22:16.048 --> 22:20.382
As of right now, Teal'c is wanted
for kidnapping and murder.

22:29.962 --> 22:34.023
Thanks for getting me out of there.
I just couldn't be in that place tonight.

22:34.099 --> 22:37.660
- Where do you wish to go?
- Just keep driving.

22:42.374 --> 22:44.569
What? What is it?

22:44.643 --> 22:48.238
I do not wish to alarm you,
but I believe that we are being followed.

22:48.313 --> 22:51.248
- Who would be following us?
- Perhaps Doug.

22:51.316 --> 22:55.252
No. He doesn't know I'm gone yet.

22:58.624 --> 23:00.592
Then they are
most likely following me.

23:00.659 --> 23:03.719
You? Why would anyone
be following you?

23:03.796 --> 23:05.889
It is difficult to explain.

23:12.805 --> 23:15.035
- Can you lose them?
- I believe so.

23:15.107 --> 23:18.634
However, it will require me
to violate posted speed limits...

23:18.711 --> 23:20.906
and several
safe driving regulations.

23:20.979 --> 23:23.447
I'm okay with that.

23:25.250 --> 23:26.512
Hold on.

23:38.263 --> 23:41.323
Don't tell me you learned
how to do that back in your village.

23:44.269 --> 23:48.433
There are aspects of my life
which I am not at liberty to divulge.

23:50.075 --> 23:52.873
What are you,
a spy or something?

23:55.013 --> 23:59.006
One thing's for sure. You're not
really Dr. Jackson's research assistant.

23:59.084 --> 24:02.520
That much I figured
after about 30 seconds.

24:05.557 --> 24:07.218
It's okay.

24:09.061 --> 24:12.030
For now,
I'm just glad you're here.

24:37.456 --> 24:40.584
- Thanks for meeting me.
- No problem.

24:42.561 --> 24:47.828
Pete, I'm sorry.
I need a little more time.

24:47.900 --> 24:50.027
Look, you know
how I feel about you.

24:50.102 --> 24:52.593
It's just there's some things
I need to work out.

24:54.106 --> 24:57.769
- Okay.
- Anyway, that's not what this is about.

24:57.843 --> 24:59.174
- It's not?
- No.

25:01.079 --> 25:03.513
I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't so important.

25:05.484 --> 25:07.975
What's goin' on?

25:08.053 --> 25:09.987
I need your help.

25:42.087 --> 25:44.555
Freeze!
Turn around.

25:44.623 --> 25:47.558
Interlace your fingers
behind your head.

25:55.133 --> 25:57.260
Well, where is he being held?

25:57.336 --> 25:59.896
He's in his old quarters.

25:59.972 --> 26:01.997
Is he at least under guard?

26:02.074 --> 26:05.771
- He's not going anywhere.
- He's a murder suspect.

26:08.280 --> 26:12.080
You know, I talked to him.
He said he didn't do it.

26:12.150 --> 26:14.084
- That's good enough for you, isn't it?
- Pretty much.

26:14.152 --> 26:17.280
Well, unfortunately, you're not
in charge of this investigation.

26:19.057 --> 26:22.959
He also said he felt like
he was being followed last night.

26:23.028 --> 26:26.191
The OSI did not have
Teal'c under surveillance.

26:29.768 --> 26:32.293
How'd you find him?

26:32.371 --> 26:35.135
We received a tip.

26:35.207 --> 26:38.438
That didn't strike you as odd?

26:38.510 --> 26:40.444
I told you something
like this might happen.

26:40.512 --> 26:43.413
You flat-out
ignored my warnings.

26:43.482 --> 26:47.612
Not so much ignored
as completely disregarded.

26:47.686 --> 26:50.587
With all due respect, General...

26:50.656 --> 26:54.490
I'm going to have to insist that Teal'c
be placed in confinement immediately...

26:54.559 --> 26:57.392
or I will recommend
that he be held elsewhere.

27:11.910 --> 27:14.105
What the hell?

27:23.322 --> 27:25.449
<i>Did you get my message?</i>

27:27.492 --> 27:30.154
- Who is this?
- <i>The symbols, Dr. Jackson.</i>

27:30.228 --> 27:32.958
<i>Do you recognize them?</i>

27:33.031 --> 27:37.229
- I don't know who you think this is-
- <i>We need them translated into Goa'uld.</i>

27:40.072 --> 27:41.972
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

27:42.040 --> 27:45.999
<i>We know it's the language of the Ancients,</i>
<i>but the dialect is obscure.</i>

27:46.078 --> 27:49.047
<i>You're the one man on Earth</i>
<i>who can translate them.</i>

27:49.114 --> 27:52.413
- <i>Your friend Teal'c is in trouble.</i>
- How'd you know about that?

27:52.484 --> 27:55.612
<i>We can help him.</i>
<i>We've been watching him.</i>

27:55.687 --> 27:59.680
- <i>In fact, we saw the whole thing.</i>
- You witnessed the murder?

27:59.758 --> 28:01.988
<i>We've got it all on tape.</i>

28:02.060 --> 28:05.188
<i>Concrete evidence</i>
<i>that proves Teal'c's innocence...</i>

28:05.263 --> 28:08.323
<i>and it's yours</i>
<i>in exchange for the translation.</i>

28:08.400 --> 28:12.734
<i>Of course, if you tell anyone,</i>
<i>we'll know, and the deal's off.</i>

28:22.781 --> 28:25.682
The investigator who checked
the position of the body...

28:25.751 --> 28:29.380
concluded that the victim was pinned
and choked against this wall...

28:29.454 --> 28:31.388
and then fell to the floor.

28:31.456 --> 28:33.390
So-

28:33.458 --> 28:36.052
So, I'm not so sure.

28:36.128 --> 28:39.154
The proximity of the body
to the wall supports that...

28:39.231 --> 28:41.756
but the position
of the body suggests otherwise.

28:41.833 --> 28:43.926
- What do you mean?
- If he fell into a slump...

28:44.002 --> 28:45.902
his legs and arms would be bent.

28:45.971 --> 28:50.032
His legs were straight
and his arms were placed by his sides...

28:50.108 --> 28:54.067
suggesting that the body was
dragged here and placed in this position.

28:54.146 --> 28:55.773
Why move the body?

28:55.847 --> 28:58.714
Well, dying against the wall
suggests that...

28:58.784 --> 29:01.275
the victim was attacked by
somebody bigger and stronger.

29:01.353 --> 29:04.413
Like Teal'c.
So it was a setup.

29:04.489 --> 29:08.926
Well, it's possible. Now, you said that
Teal'c thought he was being followed.

29:08.994 --> 29:09.961
That's right.

29:10.028 --> 29:12.292
And the air force denies
having him under surveillance?

29:12.364 --> 29:14.025
Yeah.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.592
If I was staking out
Teal'c's place...

29:18.670 --> 29:20.797
that's where I would be.

29:30.816 --> 29:32.477
Hello?

29:47.199 --> 29:50.930
From this vantage point,
you can easily see into both apartments.

29:55.073 --> 29:58.304
- Three indentations.
- Tripod.

29:59.177 --> 30:02.044
Unfortunately, I think
they cleaned the place up pretty good.

30:02.114 --> 30:04.582
- I doubt we'll find anything.
- So it's a dead end.

30:07.219 --> 30:10.518
Not necessarily.
Is there a pizza place nearby?

30:11.656 --> 30:12.645
Why?

30:12.724 --> 30:15.921
One thing about a stakeout,
you never eat healthy.

30:25.604 --> 30:29.597
Dr. Jackson.
Keep walking.

30:33.945 --> 30:36.880
You came alone.
I'm impressed.

30:36.948 --> 30:40.281
- I like a man who can follow instructions.
- Are you the one who called me?

30:40.352 --> 30:44.584
It doesn't matter.
Have you completed the translation?

30:44.656 --> 30:47.454
See, that's why I wanted to talk to you.
I need more time.

30:47.526 --> 30:49.517
You're playing with
your friend's life here, Doctor.

30:49.594 --> 30:52.757
I can't translate something
unless I understand the context.

30:52.831 --> 30:56.323
- Where they were found, what they're for.
- Do you think I'm stupid?

30:57.669 --> 30:59.330
I'm not lying.

31:03.275 --> 31:06.506
I can see we're going to have
to do this the hard way.

31:06.578 --> 31:08.068
What does that mean?

31:08.146 --> 31:10.842
Either you give us
the translation now...

31:12.083 --> 31:14.415
or I'll be forced to
take this to the next level.

31:14.486 --> 31:17.717
So, beyond
kidnapping and murder-

31:18.590 --> 31:20.888
We didn't kill the boyfriend.

31:20.959 --> 31:22.756
But we'll kill the girl
if we have to.

31:22.827 --> 31:25.022
How do I know
you even have her?

31:27.199 --> 31:29.258
Come with me,
and I'll show you.

31:31.136 --> 31:32.763
I got a thing, so-

31:32.837 --> 31:36.534
I have three snipers targeting
your position at this very moment, Doctor.

31:37.609 --> 31:39.270
You're bluffing.

31:46.051 --> 31:49.248
Position one,
take the coffee cup.

31:53.858 --> 31:55.792
So, are we gonna take
your car or mine...

31:55.860 --> 31:58.158
or should I just follow you?

32:00.765 --> 32:03.199
<i>We checked a couple pizza joints</i>
<i>and all-night delivery places...</i>

32:03.268 --> 32:06.260
near your apartment to see if there
had been any sudden repeat customers.

32:06.338 --> 32:08.670
An interesting investigative method.

32:08.740 --> 32:11.868
I thought it was a little crazy at first,
but we actually got a lead at one place.

32:11.943 --> 32:14.241
The owner reported
a Caucasian male who'd been in...

32:14.312 --> 32:16.439
half a dozen times
during the last two weeks.

32:16.514 --> 32:19.881
- Is that unusual?
- Not necessarily.

32:19.951 --> 32:21.543
But we thought
it was worth checking out.

32:21.620 --> 32:23.815
We got a license plate from
the security camera out front...

32:23.888 --> 32:25.753
and we're running it down.

32:31.196 --> 32:34.131
Well, Kendrick is finally convinced
something else is going on here.

32:34.199 --> 32:37.134
- What changed his mind?
- Daniel's missing.

32:49.147 --> 32:51.741
So you guys are ex-NI D?

32:53.685 --> 32:55.846
You're calling yourselves
The Trust now, right?

32:58.923 --> 33:01.983
We want the same thing
you want, Dr. Jackson.

33:02.060 --> 33:05.188
- We're trying to protect the planet.
- And that's why you were watching Teal'c.

33:05.263 --> 33:08.528
You thought he was a significant threat
to planetary security.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.534
Stargate Command
may think it's okay...

33:10.602 --> 33:13.969
to let an alien roam the streets
unsupervised, but we beg to differ.

33:14.039 --> 33:17.270
Never mind the fact that he's helped save
the Earth more times than I can count.

33:17.342 --> 33:20.834
He is an alien.
Their motives can never be trusted.

33:20.912 --> 33:25.144
Anyway, he is partly responsible
for the boyfriend's death.

33:25.216 --> 33:28.549
If he hadn't shown the girl
how to crush a man's windpipe...

33:28.620 --> 33:30.019
none of this would have happened.

33:30.088 --> 33:32.818
- So she killed him?
- It was self-defense, really.

33:32.891 --> 33:35.189
He was getting out of hand.

33:35.260 --> 33:39.128
That's when you moved in. You planted
evidence to make it look like he did it.

33:39.197 --> 33:41.631
We saw an opportunity,
and we took it.

34:10.261 --> 34:13.389
- What the hell is going on here?
- The situation is under control.

34:13.465 --> 34:16.593
You were supposed to get
the information and leave.

34:16.668 --> 34:18.329
He wasn't going to cooperate.

34:18.403 --> 34:20.803
He's a member of SG-1.
Do you have any idea...

34:20.872 --> 34:23.602
what kind of resources
they'll mobilize to get him back?

34:23.675 --> 34:27.509
Once we get the translation,
it'll be too late.

34:28.980 --> 34:30.811
Bring the girl.

34:45.797 --> 34:48.357
<i>Sam, it's me.</i>
<i>I traced the car from the pizza place.</i>

34:48.433 --> 34:50.526
It's a rental. The name
on the agreement's a fake I D.

34:50.602 --> 34:51.569
That's our man.

34:51.636 --> 34:53.433
<i>Whoever set this up</i>
<i>knew what they were doing.</i>

34:53.505 --> 34:56.065
<i>I've got a bank account,</i>
<i>Social Security number and credit cards...</i>

34:56.141 --> 34:58.405
all from a guy
who died six months ago.

34:59.744 --> 35:01.609
Okay.
Let's focus on the car.

35:01.679 --> 35:03.909
Find out if the rental company
has satellite tracking.

35:03.982 --> 35:06.746
I'm on it. I'll call you
as soon as I have something.

35:10.989 --> 35:13.651
Uplink is established.
We're ready to transmit.

35:17.395 --> 35:19.386
We need those symbols.

35:30.074 --> 35:33.840
- What's happening? Who are these people?
- It's gonna be okay.

35:34.746 --> 35:38.147
The symbols, now,
or we kill the girl.

35:38.216 --> 35:40.480
She's got nothing
to do with this.

35:44.022 --> 35:46.286
Look, Dr. Jackson,
if it had been up to me...

35:46.357 --> 35:48.291
things never would have
gone this far.

35:48.359 --> 35:51.795
It was supposed to be a simple
surveillance operation.

35:52.997 --> 35:57.331
But then, this little domestic dispute
happened. Teal'c got involved.

35:57.402 --> 35:59.267
We knew you weren't
going to help us voluntarily.

35:59.337 --> 36:01.362
So you decided to try
a little blackmail instead.

36:01.439 --> 36:04.806
Let's just say
one thing led to another.

36:04.876 --> 36:07.640
But, in any case,
it's too late for all that now.

36:07.712 --> 36:11.170
So either you give us
what we want...

36:14.619 --> 36:16.177
or I will kill her.

36:34.706 --> 36:37.834
And, by the way, we'll know immediately
if the symbols are incorrect.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.161
Scanning.

37:05.637 --> 37:08.197
Transmitting symbols.

37:12.644 --> 37:15.238
Translation confirmed.

37:16.614 --> 37:18.377
Good. Get up.

37:31.195 --> 37:32.594
Over there.
Face the wall.

37:38.002 --> 37:40.664
- I gave you what you wanted.
- Move!

37:46.811 --> 37:49.143
I said, face the wall.

37:50.415 --> 37:52.076
You don't have to do this.

38:09.033 --> 38:10.967
It's gonna be okay.

38:27.585 --> 38:29.075
Team two in position and ready.

38:31.522 --> 38:33.649
Go!

38:51.342 --> 38:54.106
He's unconscious.
There's no one here.

38:54.178 --> 38:56.578
We've got all the exits covered.
There's no way they could've gotten out.

38:56.648 --> 38:58.639
How is that possible?

39:09.494 --> 39:11.155
Thank you.

39:18.903 --> 39:22.930
So it's normal for the bad guys
just to disappear into thin air, right?

39:23.007 --> 39:26.306
Not really. Though, now I think about it,
it's not the first time it's happened.

39:27.178 --> 39:30.807
- Just another day at the office.
- Yes.

39:30.882 --> 39:33.077
It figures you'd be
used to it by now.

39:33.151 --> 39:35.085
No.
I mean, "Yes."

39:38.356 --> 39:41.519
- "Yes" as in-
- Yes.

39:45.496 --> 39:47.589
- Are you messin' with me?
- No.

39:47.665 --> 39:51.260
- Which means-
- Yes.

39:51.335 --> 39:53.235
- You don't need more time?
- No.

39:53.304 --> 39:57.331
- Therefore?
- Yes.

40:19.030 --> 40:21.396
Be careful with that package, Eric.
Its contents are-

40:26.404 --> 40:27.530
fragile.

40:27.605 --> 40:29.971
Sorry.

40:30.041 --> 40:32.771
There is no need for an apology.

40:32.844 --> 40:35.813
I am grateful
for your assistance.

40:45.890 --> 40:48.222
So, you're really leaving?

40:49.961 --> 40:51.895
Indeed I am.

40:51.963 --> 40:55.126
You don't have to do this.
The whole thing was my fault.

40:55.199 --> 40:57.633
There is no need
to blame yourself.

40:57.702 --> 41:00.637
The men in the warehouse,
I didn't know who they were.

41:00.705 --> 41:02.832
No one told me anything.

41:02.907 --> 41:06.172
But I know they were
using me to get to you.

41:06.244 --> 41:08.678
If it had not been you,
it would have been someone else.

41:08.746 --> 41:11.943
They would not hesitate to exploit
any relationship to their advantage.

41:12.016 --> 41:14.143
What do they want?

41:14.218 --> 41:16.083
That, I cannot say.

41:16.154 --> 41:18.987
Right.

41:19.056 --> 41:21.081
So, where are you
going to go?

41:21.159 --> 41:23.423
Back to where I came from.

41:23.494 --> 41:25.655
What does that mean?

41:25.730 --> 41:27.925
It means I must say good-bye.

41:39.043 --> 41:40.635
This is all that was left.

41:43.881 --> 41:45.542
Thank you.

41:47.218 --> 41:48.879
Check it out.

41:52.423 --> 41:53.685
I am honored.

41:55.793 --> 41:56.987
Later, T.
