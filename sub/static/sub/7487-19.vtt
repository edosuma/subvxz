00:07.208 --> 00:09.609
You look good, olivia.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.011
Looks can be deceiving, though,
can't they?

00:12.013 --> 00:14.413
I see you have
a few more locks.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.449
That's good.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.484
You can never be too careful,
can you?

00:18.486 --> 00:20.085
What do you want?

00:20.087 --> 00:22.054
I have a problem --

00:22.056 --> 00:23.889
A rather big one,
actually,

00:23.890 --> 00:25.723
And since you're a fixer,
i thought i'd come to you.

00:25.726 --> 00:29.028
You see, apparently
there's a group of people

00:29.030 --> 00:31.463
Who have decided
that i'm a criminal.

00:31.465 --> 00:35.534
They're building a case,
some preposterous claim

00:35.536 --> 00:39.505
About a top-secret
spy organization called b613

00:39.507 --> 00:42.408
That i'm<i> supposedly</i>
the head of.

00:42.410 --> 00:46.578
I mean, have you ever heard
anything so ridiculous?

00:46.580 --> 00:48.814
Anyway, i'd be happy
to shut it down myself,

00:48.816 --> 00:51.250
But i'm just a paleontologist
at the smithsonian

00:51.252 --> 00:53.318
And i don't think my methods
would work,

00:53.320 --> 00:57.756
So i'm giving you a chance --

00:57.758 --> 00:59.658
One chance --

00:59.660 --> 01:01.393
To shut it down
yourself.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.096
If you can do that
in the next 48 hours...

01:04.098 --> 01:05.831
I'm not lifting a finger
for you.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.467
Tell me, who do you think
stands to lose the most

01:08.469 --> 01:10.769
When this so-called b613
is made public --

01:10.771 --> 01:13.072
The quiet paleontologist
collecting bones

01:13.074 --> 01:14.473
Or the man down the street

01:14.475 --> 01:16.341
Who could have pulled the plug
on it and didn't?

01:16.343 --> 01:19.578
Who, in fact,
actively participated,

01:19.580 --> 01:21.213

at the helm,

01:21.215 --> 01:23.282
Using him
to service his own agenda --

01:23.284 --> 01:25.417
I don't care
about any of that.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.186
I care about justice.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.788
You say that to me now
because you're angry at me,

01:29.790 --> 01:33.125
But think
who we are talking about,

01:33.127 --> 01:36.862
What you have done for him,
the things you've sacrificed.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.298
Is your hatred for me
so great --

01:41.368 --> 01:44.103

01:44.105 --> 01:49.441
So great that you are willing
to tear him down, too?

Ah.

01:50.845 --> 01:53.445

Something's changed.

your expectation of perfection?

how far you run,

No matter
how white the knight...

are just like your father?

You are a warrior --

02:45.900 --> 02:48.834
Never reckless,
never naive,

02:48.836 --> 02:51.904
Too smart
to let fear drive you.

02:51.906 --> 02:55.807
Precise, quiet, calculating,

02:55.809 --> 02:58.377
You will wait
for the right time.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.213
You will look
at all the possible outcomes.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.849
You'll understand
what needs to be done.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.250
You will pick a side

03:05.252 --> 03:07.319
And then you will handle
this situation

03:07.321 --> 03:09.922
In the manner we both know
it needs to be handled.

03:09.924 --> 03:13.692
You will burn it down
and never look back.

you're loyal to people.

Of what is right,
of your fundamental belief

03:30.711 --> 03:34.479
That the republic must stand
at all costs.

You didn't have to bring him
into this at all.
I did.

The alternative was
to kill him.

Would you have preferred
i go that route?

into his own hands.

Marcus: I told you i didn't send
the mayor's wife any e-mails.

19:04.878 --> 19:07.345
Stop talking.
Is he under arrest?

19:08.214 --> 19:09.213
No.

19:09.215 --> 19:10.465
Then you can't keep him.

19:10.466 --> 19:11.716
This is an illegal detention,
and we're leaving.

about threatening e-mails

19:15.522 --> 19:17.288

We'll talk about it
at my office.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.457
I didn't send her
any e-mails.
At my office.

Do you see this man
standing here?

19:25.832 --> 19:26.864
Yes.

19:26.866 --> 19:27.865
Wrong answer.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.367
You do not see him
standing here

19:29.368 --> 19:30.868
Because if you<i> did</i> see him
standing here,

19:30.870 --> 19:33.204
Then i would want to know
how he got here.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.239
Was he arrested?
Were you arrested?

19:35.241 --> 19:36.707
No.
Ah.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.493
He wasn't.

19:38.494 --> 19:40.278
Well, then why was he taken
off the street,

19:40.280 --> 19:42.213
Put in a patrol car,
and brought to a police station?

19:42.215 --> 19:43.714
Because that sounds like
an arrest.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.184
Except an arrest would mean that
you read him his miranda rights.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.919
And you didn't read him
his miranda rights.

19:47.921 --> 19:49.220
Did they read you
your miranda rights?

19:49.222 --> 19:50.572
No.

You didn't read him
his miranda rights.

19:51.925 --> 19:53.858

Are you confused?

19:53.860 --> 19:57.328
Well, i'm not here,
but i would be if i was.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.696
Do you see the kinds
of questions i would have

19:58.698 --> 20:00.264
If he was here?

20:00.266 --> 20:02.600
And i probably wouldn't be
the only one with questions.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.202
I think the united states
department of justice,

20:04.204 --> 20:05.736
Which is already investigating
your department

20:05.738 --> 20:07.271

the brandon parker shooting,

20:07.273 --> 20:08.506

20:08.508 --> 20:10.575
So, i don't think he's here.

20:10.577 --> 20:14.312

is ever going to think

20:14.314 --> 20:15.797
That he was here.

And if it ever gets out
that he was here,

or online or anywhere ever,

20:19.919 --> 20:22.320

my questions,

And i will get answers,
because i am someone

to my questions.

this question again.

Oh, we know exactly who.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.668
The i.P. Address is linked
to the mayor's office.

Marcus: Mayor verrano?

his own wife killed?

Olivia: We have to be 100% sure,
because if it is the mayor

21:15.675 --> 21:17.308
And he's trying
to frame you for it,

Verrano's coming for you,
marcus.

This is first-degree murder
we're talking about.

There were three of them.

One of them had a hunting knife,
the other two had guns.

you snapped her neck?

21:42.735 --> 21:44.435
They called him mickey.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.636
What?

21:45.637 --> 21:46.836
The guy who killed natalie,
that's what they called him.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.417
That's his name.

21:48.418 --> 21:49.996
Look into
verrano's acquaintances.

21:49.997 --> 21:51.575
Check into everyone on
his payroll, past and present.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.648
So, local and state police
departments

21:57.650 --> 22:00.084
Will now be required to collect
and report data on arrests

22:00.086 --> 22:02.353
So we can track
racial disparities, correct?

22:02.355 --> 22:03.921
Correct.
You didn't go to law school?

22:03.923 --> 22:05.589

correct?

Correct.
You're sure?

About law school?
Yes.

22:12.332 --> 22:13.864
Not even, like, a semester?
No.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.434
And local and state police
departments will now be required

To use independent
special prosecutors

22:18.037 --> 22:19.420
In the investigation

22:19.421 --> 22:20.804
Of police-involved

22:20.807 --> 22:22.373
That is also correct.

22:22.375 --> 22:23.774
So, i have a question.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.776
How do we enforce it?

22:25.778 --> 22:26.877

22:26.879 --> 22:28.079
Any of it, all of it.

22:28.081 --> 22:29.847
Everything in this bill.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.199
Well, it's a law.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.550
Those are all requirements
under the law.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.152
They're mandatory.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.753
Which means there has to be
a way to enforce them,

22:35.755 --> 22:37.655
Or they're not mandatory,
right?

22:37.657 --> 22:39.957
If say to casey,
"clean your room,"

22:39.959 --> 22:41.375
Which i usually don't say

22:41.376 --> 22:42.792
Because casey
is really good about that --

22:42.795 --> 22:44.895
But if i do, and she said,
"no," which again,

22:44.897 --> 22:46.664
She wouldn't --
but if she did,

22:46.665 --> 22:48.432
And i don't have any way
to<i> make</i> her clean her room,

22:48.434 --> 22:50.735
Then i'm really not saying,
"clean your room."

22:50.737 --> 22:52.470
I'm asking her
to clean her room.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.739
It's a request,
not a requirement.

22:54.741 --> 22:55.973
Yeah, i'm sorry.
Who's casey?

22:55.975 --> 22:57.909

She's 10.

In various grants to state
and local police departments.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.782
Why don't we condition
that money

23:04.784 --> 23:06.751
On doing the things
in this bill?

23:06.753 --> 23:08.419
Because if we do that,

23:08.420 --> 23:10.086
The things in this bill
will actually get done.

23:10.089 --> 23:14.558

is a bunch of requests.

will have just passed.

in this briefcase they gave you

When you first
became command.

23:55.951 --> 23:57.968
It was one of several missions
he provided briefs for, yes.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.837

to information

About other missions --
missions that happened

24:01.908 --> 24:03.040

with remington?

before i joined b613, but yes.

But, susan,
we are running out of time.

29:34.273 --> 29:37.174
The country needs
this bill now.

29:37.176 --> 29:39.443
The president needs
this bill now.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.378
And<i> you</i> need
this bill now.

29:43.349 --> 29:44.348
So you can announce
your senate run.

29:45.351 --> 29:46.817

No one.
I just assumed.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.256
That's the real reason
i'm here, right?

29:52.258 --> 29:54.792
So you can take my senate seat
and then not have to worry

When you run for president.

Once you announce.

able to announce soon?

You're going to announce that

But that you are pulling out
of the race.

32:33.115 --> 32:34.481
You're going to endorse
marcus walker for mayor.

You will express your sympathies
to mayor verrano.

32:41.694 --> 32:43.260
You will tell him how sorry
you are

32:43.262 --> 32:45.162
That he leaves the campaign
under these circumstances,

32:45.164 --> 32:46.697
And then you will humbly
accept his endorsement.

You will both keep it
