00:24.190 --> 00:27.353
<i>Theorizing that one could time travel</i>
<i>within his own lifetime, </i>

00:27.427 --> 00:30.624
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett led an elite group</i>
<i>of scientists into the desert... </i>

00:30.697 --> 00:35.134
<i>to develop a top secret project</i>
<i>known as Quantum Leap. </i>

00:35.201 --> 00:37.635
<i>Pressured to prove his theories</i>
<i>or lose funding, </i>

00:37.704 --> 00:41.470
<i>Dr. Beckett prematurely</i>
<i>stepped into the project accelerator... </i>

00:41.541 --> 00:43.532
<i>and vanished. </i>

00:49.983 --> 00:52.383
<i>He awoke</i>
<i>to find himself in the past, </i>

00:52.452 --> 00:57.719
<i>suffering from partial amnesia</i>
<i>and facing a mirror image</i>
<i>that was not his own. </i>

00:57.791 --> 01:01.056
<i>Fortunately, contact with</i>
<i>his own time was maintained... </i>

01:01.127 --> 01:04.153
<i>through brain wave transmissions</i>
<i>with Al, the project observer, </i>

01:04.230 --> 01:08.963
<i>who appeared in the form of a hologram</i>
<i>that only Dr. Beckett can see and hear. </i>

01:09.035 --> 01:11.435
<i>Trapped in the past, </i>
<i>Dr. Beckett finds himself... </i>

01:11.504 --> 01:13.665
<i>leaping from life to life, </i>

01:13.740 --> 01:15.435
<i>putting things right</i>
<i>that once went wrong... </i>

01:15.508 --> 01:20.639
<i>and hoping each time that</i>
<i>his next leap will be the leap home. </i>

01:26.686 --> 01:28.779
<i> </i>

01:37.097 --> 01:39.622
Come on, old man.

01:39.699 --> 01:43.601
Double or nothing.
What do you say?

01:51.377 --> 01:53.743
I'm--|

01:53.813 --> 01:56.043
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

01:59.719 --> 02:03.587
Okay. We'll just see
who has the last laugh.

02:03.656 --> 02:06.648
$300 says you can't make the shot.

02:06.726 --> 02:10.059
- Which ball was I shooting at?
-

02:10.130 --> 02:12.598
$400.

02:12.665 --> 02:16.226
- <i>Oh. You got him on the ropes now. </i>
- Oh, yeah. On the ropes.

02:16.302 --> 02:19.738
<i>Come on. Enough stalling. </i>
<i>Come on. Shoot. </i>

02:19.806 --> 02:22.502
Yeah, shoot!
You'll never make that eight ball.

02:35.788 --> 02:40.020
<i>My man, </i>
<i>you just bought me a new Cadillac. </i>

02:40.093 --> 02:43.187
Oh, boy.

03:57.103 --> 03:59.970
Don't know why

04:01.040 --> 04:04.737
There's no sun up in the sky

04:04.811 --> 04:07.371
Stormy weather

04:09.649 --> 04:12.413
Since my man and I

04:12.485 --> 04:14.476
Ain't together

04:17.390 --> 04:19.983
Keeps rainin' all the time

04:22.996 --> 04:25.658
What?
Can I tell him?

04:25.732 --> 04:27.666
P-Please, can I tell him now?

04:27.734 --> 04:30.100
Yeah, sure.
S-Son,

04:30.169 --> 04:32.535
d-do you know who you are playing?

04:32.605 --> 04:36.939
<i>This is Charlie ''Black Magic'' Walters, </i>

04:37.010 --> 04:40.275
the greatest pool player
in the world--

04:40.346 --> 04:42.280
including Chicago.

04:42.348 --> 04:44.612
And he could get
that p-pretty Cadillac of yours...

04:44.684 --> 04:47.278
and-- Vrroom--
drive it right up to the bank.

04:47.353 --> 04:51.619
<i>Y-Yeah. He sure put</i>
<i>the hook through your nose. </i>

04:51.691 --> 04:55.787
<i>And he's about to reel you in</i>
<i>just like a big ol'catfish ready to fry. </i>

04:55.862 --> 04:57.955
<i>A-Ain't ya?</i>

04:58.031 --> 05:00.363
Ain't ya, Magic?

05:00.433 --> 05:04.961
Well, uh, that's--
that's the general idea.

05:12.111 --> 05:14.841
You really
Charlie ''Black Magic'' Walters?

05:14.914 --> 05:17.576
No! He's Minnesota Fats!

05:17.650 --> 05:20.380
'Cept he lost 50 pounds.
And got a tan!

05:24.324 --> 05:27.259
Yes, it keeps on raining

05:27.327 --> 05:31.991
All the time

05:33.333 --> 05:35.597
Thank you.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.738
You all wanna shout and carry on like that,
get up on stage and do it!

05:44.811 --> 05:46.745
And, Poppie,
give the man back his money.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.505
I haven't really,
uh, taken it yet.

05:51.851 --> 05:55.287
Here. Now, get on outta here
while you still got some pants
left to walk in.

06:01.294 --> 06:04.354
$500 says I can still beat you.
No, no, son.

06:09.936 --> 06:12.928
You don't really want me
to take your money, do ya?

06:16.976 --> 06:20.241
- Well--
- Grady, give the man his money.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.406
All right.

06:22.482 --> 06:26.578
And remember,
he didn't even have to
s-sink that ball to beat you.

06:27.653 --> 06:30.918
Uh, Magic,
I just wanted you to know--

06:30.990 --> 06:33.083
uh, I didn't mean any disrespect.

06:35.161 --> 06:37.925
Well, that's okay.
Uh, we all get a little
carried away sometimes.

06:37.997 --> 06:40.261
Y-You know, I was wondering--

06:40.333 --> 06:43.325
did you really
beat Machine Gun Butler
playing left-handed?

06:45.605 --> 06:48.233
- Is that this hand?
-

06:48.307 --> 06:50.298
<i>You see?</i>

06:50.376 --> 06:53.675
Well, yeah, then, uh--
 I guess I did.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.112
And Teddie Fantastic in Detroit?

06:56.182 --> 06:58.446
Uh, yeah.
<i>No, no, no, no. </i>

06:58.518 --> 07:01.976
Uh, you beat M-Mosconi
in Detroit.

07:02.054 --> 07:05.490
<i>And Teddie Fantastic</i>
<i>at the Palace in Frisco. </i>

07:05.558 --> 07:09.085
Oh, uh, right, right. Yeah. That--
Well, that was a long time ago.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.255
I heard it was just a couple years back.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.532
Maybe I was thinking of somebody else.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.228
Man. What a match.

07:17.303 --> 07:20.830
I wish I would've been there.
How many balls in a row did you run?

07:20.907 --> 07:22.841
Quite-- Quite a few.

07:22.909 --> 07:26.538
Oh! 2 40.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.546
Two-hundred and f--

07:28.614 --> 07:33.244
Well, uh, now, you know, thinking back,
I guess it was about two-hundred and f--

07:33.319 --> 07:36.482
- Maybe it was 2 41.
- 

07:36.556 --> 07:41.220
Well, it's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Mr. Magic. A real pleasure.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.922
Well, uh, um,
thank you, uh--
Lester.

07:43.996 --> 07:45.930
Uh, Lester.

07:47.266 --> 07:50.064
<i>Uh-huh. </i>

07:50.136 --> 07:52.070
Well, there go your earrings.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.039
How'd you like to be known
as ''Lefty''?|

07:55.107 --> 07:57.803
Lighten up, baby.
I'm just trying to make a living.

07:57.877 --> 08:00.710
Hell, everybody gambles
now and then, right, Magic?

08:01.948 --> 08:04.883
- I'm sor-- I'm sorry?
- I said everybody gambles now and then.

08:04.951 --> 08:08.717
Well, actually, I-- I was thinking
about giving it up for a while.

08:08.788 --> 08:12.053
Oh, you can't do that--
not until you play me, can you?

08:12.124 --> 08:15.389
Uh, till he whup you, fool.

08:15.461 --> 08:17.622
You lookin' for a manhole
to fall into, Grady?

08:17.697 --> 08:20.063
Hey. Take it easy.
Eddie, why don't you just beat it?

08:20.132 --> 08:24.125
Could all the smoke in this joint
be clouding your memory,

08:24.203 --> 08:27.570
or have you forgotten
I own the marker to this place...

08:27.640 --> 08:29.574
that's due in two days?

08:29.642 --> 08:34.409
How could I forget,
with you hangin' over my shoulder
to remind me every five minutes?

08:34.480 --> 08:37.244
That's not why
I'm hangin' on you, baby.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.909
I've got to hand it to you, Vi.

08:40.986 --> 08:45.924
You turned this ol' pool joint
into a real nice uptown spot.

08:47.593 --> 08:50.994
A real uptown spot.|

08:53.065 --> 08:55.431
It's gonna be a pleasure ownin' it!|

08:59.305 --> 09:02.706
Don't you worry, Miss Violet.
That fool ain't gonna never
own your place.

09:02.775 --> 09:05.369
Magic gonna see to that.
Ain't that right, Magic?

09:05.444 --> 09:07.878
Uh, yeah, well, right.

09:07.947 --> 09:10.381
How are your eyes, Poppie?

09:10.449 --> 09:13.384
My-- My eyes?
My eyes. Uh, They're fine.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.724
I love you.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.892
Mm-hmm.
They do look a little different.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.559
<i>Sam, this is just unbelievable. </i>

09:29.969 --> 09:31.459
That's Alberta.

09:32.538 --> 09:35.905
- Alberta?
- Oh, Alberta. You want me to take her?

09:35.975 --> 09:40.173
That's Magic's stick.
It's 21 ounces of pure African ebony
inlaid with mother-of-pearl.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.238
Yeah, sure.
C-Come on now, Alberta.
I'll put you to bed.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.581
<i>Magic named that stick</i>
<i>after his wife, Alberta. </i>

09:46.652 --> 09:48.643
It's as big a legend as he is.

09:48.721 --> 09:51.952
Uh, n-n-no, no, no, no.
Y-You can't put that there, man.

09:52.024 --> 09:53.958
This is Magic's table.

09:54.026 --> 09:58.759
I swear, some people ain't got no respect.
Good night, darlin'.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.101
Oh, Sam, not the head again.

10:03.169 --> 10:06.468
Every time we leap in, we gotta go
talk in the men's room. It's disgusting.

10:06.539 --> 10:10.475
- Can you think of a better place to talk?
- The ladies' room.

10:13.212 --> 10:17.672
Al, everybody thinks
I'm some kind of a pool giant.

10:17.750 --> 10:21.686
Well, you are.
You're Charlie ''Black Magic'' Walters.

10:29.195 --> 10:31.288
I never heard of him.

10:31.364 --> 10:35.130
Man, when I walked into that waiting room
and saw him sitting there, I couldn't believe it.

10:35.201 --> 10:39.865
<i>I never thought I'd see Magic again. </i>
<i>It's been over 40 years since I last saw him. </i>

10:42.074 --> 10:44.975
You know him?
Know him?

10:45.044 --> 10:47.478
I've held Alberta.

10:47.546 --> 10:50.572
There's maybe five people in the world
that can say that.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.881
I've even used her to sink a ball.

10:53.953 --> 10:56.979
Al, I've never seen you
so excited about anything.

10:57.056 --> 10:59.991
I mean, this is just a pool cue.
It's not like it's a woman.

11:00.059 --> 11:03.586
Okay. When I was 1 0 years old,
I ran away from the orphanage.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.759
After a couple of days, I was cold,
I was scared, I was lonely.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.859
I got so desperate,
I even tried to pick a guy's pocket.

11:10.936 --> 11:13.598
- Black Magic's?
- Right.

11:13.673 --> 11:17.268
Now, he didn't turn me into the cops.
He fed me. He bought me a jacket.

11:17.343 --> 11:22.280
He said to me
that kids shouldn't be in orphanages,
that a kid should be raised by a family,

11:22.348 --> 11:25.442
<i>and I should travel with him</i>
<i>until we could find one. </i>

11:25.518 --> 11:29.614
Well, I did. We drifted around together,
went to Chi, went to St. Louie--

11:29.689 --> 11:35.286
went to the Big Easy where he got busted
for shooting pool in a ''whites only'' pool hall.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.852
And you ended up
back in the orphanage.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.727
It wasn't his fault.

11:39.799 --> 11:41.790
I wasn't implying that it was.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.631
Oh, I-- I'm sorry, Sam.

11:44.704 --> 11:48.697
It's just that those few months
were real important in my life.

11:48.774 --> 11:53.643
<i>He turned me around, that old guy, </i>
<i>showed me that there were people</i>
<i>in the world that really cared. </i>

11:53.713 --> 11:55.908
That's why you gotta help him, Sam.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.744
Al, I'm gonna help him.

11:57.817 --> 12:02.914
Mm. The only problem
is Eddie Davis,|

12:02.988 --> 12:06.981
a slime-ball pool shark
that Magic has never played,

12:07.059 --> 12:09.050
because, well,
he doesn't shoot pool with trash.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.619
Eddie implied that I--
that Magic has a game with him.

12:11.697 --> 12:15.758
Well, Violet borrowed some money
from a loan shark.

12:15.835 --> 12:19.066
She was gonna change this old pool hall
into a blues club.

12:19.138 --> 12:23.302
And Eddie bought her marker,
and that's what he's putting up
to make this match with Magic.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.309
It's an expensive way
to get a pool game.

12:25.377 --> 12:28.346
Well, that is if you lose,
but Eddie doesn't figure to lose.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.042
See, he knows
that Magic's eyesight is gone.

12:33.018 --> 12:35.009
But what he doesn't know...

12:35.087 --> 12:37.146
is that your eyesight is 20/20.

12:37.223 --> 12:40.021
Al, look, my eyes may be fine,
but I--

12:40.092 --> 12:43.152
I couldn't shoot a game of pool
with a shotgun.

12:44.230 --> 12:47.961
Well, you're gonna have to learn,
or else Violet's dream is lost...

12:48.033 --> 12:49.967
and Magic
won't ever forgive himself...

12:50.035 --> 12:51.969
for not coming through
for his granddaughter.

12:52.037 --> 12:54.437
And I'll never forgive myself
for not coming through for Magic.

13:08.087 --> 13:11.921
Morning!
Wow. You're mighty chipper, Poppie.

13:13.659 --> 13:16.992
Yeah, well, I, you know--
I had some, uh, great sleep.

13:17.062 --> 13:19.292
Um, you need a hand?

13:19.365 --> 13:21.925
Two or three if you've got 'em.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.367
Okay.
Thanks.

13:24.436 --> 13:26.597
You know, I, uh,

13:26.672 --> 13:29.607
kinda woke up
with this great idea this morning.

13:29.675 --> 13:33.202
Uh, I think I know
how we can keep the club...

13:33.279 --> 13:35.509
without havin' to play Eddie.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.981
This doesn't involve a cement mixer
or anything?

13:38.050 --> 13:40.951
No. No, no, no. It's-- It's simple.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.079
I don't know why
I didn't think of it right away.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.715
- Morning, everybody.
- Morning, Grady.

13:45.791 --> 13:49.818
<i>Hey, Grady. </i>
Ohhh.
Miss Violet, what happened?

13:51.163 --> 13:53.256
I mean, is that broke?

13:53.332 --> 13:55.323
No, I just got a new one.

13:55.401 --> 13:59.838
Oh, no, no, no, no.
See, that's the lamp for Magic's table.

13:59.905 --> 14:01.668
Tell her.

14:02.975 --> 14:05.034
Tell her, Magic.

14:07.379 --> 14:10.177
Well, it is pretty beat up.

14:10.249 --> 14:14.913
What about all the great games
been played underneath this lamp, huh?

14:14.987 --> 14:16.921
You see them dents?

14:16.989 --> 14:19.753
Billy Blue Lightning
made that with his cue...

14:19.825 --> 14:22.794
the night you took him for 20 grand.

14:24.830 --> 14:27.390
Yeah, well, that was, uh--
that was some night, all right.

14:27.466 --> 14:30.867
<i>The lamp's old and worn out, Grady. </i>
<i>It's gotta go. </i>

14:30.936 --> 14:33.268
What? No! What about me?

14:33.339 --> 14:36.934
I'm kinda old. I'm-- I'm kinda worn.

14:37.009 --> 14:41.173
Does that mean
that I gotta go too, huh?

14:43.349 --> 14:45.340
Maybe--

14:46.352 --> 14:49.287
Maybe we should keep the lamp.

14:49.355 --> 14:54.418
It adds, uh, character.

14:54.493 --> 14:57.121
Okay, Poppie.
This is your table.

14:57.196 --> 15:01.132
You can have whatever and whoever
hangin' around it for as long as you want.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.930
<i>Good. Good. </i>
<i>'Cause I can't wait... </i>

15:04.003 --> 15:06.403
to see you
shoot Eddie's eyes out.

15:06.472 --> 15:11.171
Pop! Pop! Good night.|

15:11.243 --> 15:14.110
Poppie's gonna pay off Eddie's marker
without shootin' pool.
Oh.

15:14.179 --> 15:17.512
- Well, how you gonna do that?
- Yeah, Sam. How you gonna do that?

15:17.583 --> 15:19.517
It's simple.

15:19.585 --> 15:23.521
We go to a bank, get a loan,
and buy back your marker from Eddie.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.819
Poppie, we already tried the bank,
remember?

15:25.891 --> 15:29.725
Well, yeah, right.
But that was a while ago.
No, forget about it, Sam.

15:29.795 --> 15:32.593
It's 1 954.
It never hurts to try again.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.600
She's a woman, a single black woman,
in a world of white male bankers.

15:35.668 --> 15:40.367
No bank's gonna give no loan
to a woman.
Especially a Negro woman.

15:40.439 --> 15:43.465
See?
All I see...

15:43.542 --> 15:48.377
is a businessperson with a going concern
who needs a loan.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.938
Businessperson?|

15:51.016 --> 15:53.109
Poppie, you been
sneakin' onions again?|

15:53.185 --> 15:55.619
<i>You know how</i>
<i>they make you crazy. </i>

15:57.089 --> 15:59.683
The only thing crazy--
Besides you.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.887
is to risk everything
over a game of pool.

16:04.964 --> 16:09.128
But, Magic, you could
whup him sideways.

16:09.201 --> 16:11.135
Your eyes are worse,
aren't they, Poppie?

16:11.203 --> 16:13.296
My eyes are fine.

16:14.473 --> 16:17.374
Now, come on, what do you say?
Where's the bank?

16:19.311 --> 16:22.041
Across the street.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.248
<i>May I help you?</i>

16:29.154 --> 16:31.918
Yes, we'd like to see someone
about a business loan.

16:31.991 --> 16:36.519
- A business loan?
- That's right.

16:36.595 --> 16:40.656
Uh, I'm afraid all of our loan officers
are busy at the moment.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.106
I guess my eyesight is going,

16:49.174 --> 16:53.543
because it looks to me
like nobody's busy at the moment.

16:53.612 --> 16:55.546
Maybe you should look again.

16:58.684 --> 17:02.677
Perhaps you should talk to Mr. Griffin--
in the back.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.689
Thank you.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.633
I'd really like to help you,

17:15.701 --> 17:20.434
but, unfortunately,
the bank doesn't view pool halls
as a sound investment.

17:20.506 --> 17:24.442
But it's not a pool hall.
I'm only gonna keep a single table
for my grandfather.

17:24.510 --> 17:28.445
- It's mostly a blues club.
- Which are also uncertain businesses.

17:28.513 --> 17:30.448
Well, not this one.

17:30.516 --> 17:34.247
The place was packed last night.
And has been
since we opened it a month ago.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.253
<i>Why do you need a loan?</i>

17:36.321 --> 17:41.452
To pay off... the money I borrowed
to convert the place from a pool hall.

17:41.527 --> 17:44.758
Wait. You want a loan
to pay off a loan?

17:44.830 --> 17:48.027
I borrowed the money
from a loan shark,
because arrogant bas--

17:49.835 --> 17:51.803
bankers like you
wouldn't trust me.

17:51.870 --> 17:54.395
<i>Violet. </i>

17:54.473 --> 17:58.500
Borrowing from a loan shark
was not the best way to get the money.

17:58.577 --> 18:01.546
- That's for sure.
- It was the only way.

18:02.781 --> 18:06.774
But now that the club
is happening--

18:06.852 --> 18:09.047
Happening?
Working.

18:09.121 --> 18:11.453
Making money.
Oh.

18:11.523 --> 18:15.755
My granddaughter needs
a legitimate business loan
to protect her investment.

18:22.534 --> 18:25.970
- I'd like to help you, but--
- But you won't.

18:31.710 --> 18:35.908
I am the first Negro loan officer
in this bank.

18:35.981 --> 18:38.575
Do you know what
I had to go through to get here?

18:38.650 --> 18:41.915
How many extra hours
and weekends I had to put in?

18:42.988 --> 18:44.922
How many times
I had to swallow my pride...

18:44.990 --> 18:48.926
and say ''Well done'' to men
promoted into positions I earned?

18:50.829 --> 18:54.595
Know how many nigger jokes
I had to pretend not to hear?

19:00.839 --> 19:06.141
I'm sorry, Miss Walters,
but I don't see how I can recommend
your request to our loan committee.

19:06.211 --> 19:10.307
Come on, Poppie.
We're wastin' our breath
on this white man.

19:19.625 --> 19:22.219
You've made it.

19:22.294 --> 19:25.388
<i>Maybe it took you twice as long, </i>
<i>but you've made it. </i>

19:25.464 --> 19:28.558
And being the first bears
some responsibility...

19:28.634 --> 19:31.000
to those who are
trying to make it behind you.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.052
Violet!

19:51.990 --> 19:53.924
We'll go to another bank.

19:53.992 --> 19:56.085
If we couldn't get a loan
from a Negro banker,

19:56.161 --> 19:58.095
who the hell are we ever
gonna get one from?

19:58.163 --> 20:02.156
I don't know,
but-- but we'll find one.
Before tomorrow?

20:04.169 --> 20:06.160
It's okay, Poppie. You tried.

20:10.175 --> 20:12.939
There's gotta be a way.

20:13.011 --> 20:15.104
There is.

20:15.180 --> 20:18.240
I gotta give Eddie what
he's been after since I was 1 3.
No.

20:18.317 --> 20:20.615
Poppie, you can't see
well enough to beat him!

20:21.687 --> 20:23.678
There's no other way!

20:25.490 --> 20:27.515
The club is my dream.

20:29.361 --> 20:31.454
If I've gotta get
a little tarnished keepin it,

20:31.530 --> 20:34.192
well, that's life in the big city.

20:50.716 --> 20:53.116
Three ball in the corner pocket.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.989
<i>Oooh-whoo!</i>
<i>Man!</i>

21:05.163 --> 21:08.621
- Hot tonight, Eddie?
- That depends on what game I'm playin'.

21:08.700 --> 21:12.500
<i>The one I have in mind is pretty old. </i>

21:13.672 --> 21:16.004
Yeah, I think I know that one.

21:17.342 --> 21:19.606
I've been waitin'
a long time to play it.

21:19.678 --> 21:23.114
I'm just wonderin'
why you wanna play it now.

21:25.183 --> 21:27.174
Maybe I decided...

21:28.320 --> 21:30.311
it's the only game worth playin'.

21:34.559 --> 21:36.618
Magic? Magic!

21:36.695 --> 21:38.629
Magic! Come on.
Quick! Quick!

21:38.697 --> 21:40.961
What's the matter?
I-It's Miss Violet.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.967
She-She's acting kind of sick!

21:44.369 --> 21:47.463
I've been waitin' a long time
for this, baby.

21:47.539 --> 21:50.007
A long time.

21:50.075 --> 21:51.906
- <i> Magic!</i>
- Let go of her!

21:51.977 --> 21:53.968
Poppie!

21:54.046 --> 21:56.207
Be cool. Be cool.

21:58.383 --> 22:00.374
Magic,

22:01.386 --> 22:03.752
you been eatin' onions again?

22:03.822 --> 22:06.757
Stay away
from my granddaughter.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.760
I wasn't takin' nothin'
that wasn't bein' offered.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.991
And I got the feelin' it was bein' offered
'cause you've turned chicken, Magic.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.927
You see any feathers on me?
Does that mean we got a game?

22:18.003 --> 22:20.938
Poppie, you can't play him.
Your eyes are bad.

22:24.509 --> 22:27.103
Is that true, Magic?

22:27.179 --> 22:29.613
There's only one way to find out.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.672
Rack 'em.
Not yet.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.949
Marker's not due until tomorrow,
and that's what we're playin' for,
isn't it?

22:36.021 --> 22:38.956
Yeah.
That's what we're playin' for.

22:46.198 --> 22:49.861
M-M-Magic's gonna
c-clean your clock, doc.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.535
<i>Magic!</i>

22:58.343 --> 23:00.903
Tomorrow.

23:15.894 --> 23:18.920
<i> </i>

23:18.997 --> 23:22.592
<i> It's a blue, blue feeling </i>

23:22.667 --> 23:26.262
 <i>That's with me today </i>

23:26.338 --> 23:32.277
<i> And it's not like it's something new </i>

23:32.344 --> 23:36.610
<i> My heart needs healin'</i>

23:36.681 --> 23:40.276
That's the best I can say

23:40.352 --> 23:43.480
And I just don't know

23:43.555 --> 23:46.149
What to do

23:46.224 --> 23:48.818
<i>You know, </i>
<i>maybe Eddie will make a mistake... </i>

23:48.894 --> 23:52.694
and get on the wrong train
and end up in Peoria.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.698
That way, he'll have to forfeit.

23:54.766 --> 23:59.362
How am I gonna become
a pool shark overnight, Al?

23:59.438 --> 24:01.565
By listening to me.

24:01.640 --> 24:04.905
I was taught by the best,
remember?

24:04.976 --> 24:07.069
You know, it's kinda weird
when you think about it.

24:07.145 --> 24:12.242
I mean, you were taught by Magic.
I'm Magic.

24:12.317 --> 24:14.478
So, in a sense, that means--
So in a sense nothin'!

24:14.553 --> 24:17.579
Shoot pool, Sam. Shoot.

24:17.656 --> 24:19.988
Now let me see your bridge--
just your fingertips--

24:20.058 --> 24:22.925
No. The bridge. Like this.
Like you're holding a cigar.

24:22.994 --> 24:25.462
Holding a cigar?
What do you mean?
Yes. Like that.

24:25.530 --> 24:27.498
<i>Okay, okay. </i>
<i>All right, I got it like</i>--

24:27.566 --> 24:29.796
<i>I got it like a cigar. </i>
<i>All right. </i>

24:29.868 --> 24:32.428
You say something, Poppie?

24:34.039 --> 24:36.132
Um, I'm just practicing.

24:39.211 --> 24:42.647
Blue, blue, blue

24:42.714 --> 24:44.875
Okay, now let's see your stroke.
Okay.

24:44.950 --> 24:46.941
Now, wait a minute.
Look at your arm. It's like a rock.

24:47.018 --> 24:49.885
What do you mean a rock?
Magic has a beautiful stroke.

24:49.955 --> 24:52.515
It's slow
and it's like on a hinge.
Slow.

24:52.591 --> 24:56.891
Smooth like a hand that's tracing
up and down a woman's back.
Huh?

24:56.962 --> 25:01.160
Like that.
Now, let's see your stroke again.|

25:01.233 --> 25:03.895
It doesn't matter where the ball goes.
We're gonna work on that later.

25:03.969 --> 25:05.937
We're just workin' on your stroke.
Okay, like a hinge.

25:06.004 --> 25:08.632
Poppie, who you talkin' to?

25:11.142 --> 25:12.837
Alberta.

25:12.911 --> 25:15.641
Take a break and come sit by me.

25:17.482 --> 25:20.315
Yeah, go ahead. Looks like
the kid needs a little company.

25:23.154 --> 25:25.884
<i> </i>|

25:30.328 --> 25:33.923
You feelin' blue?
It's good for the singin'.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.991
Hard on the soul.

25:40.205 --> 25:43.936
When you're feelin' down

25:44.009 --> 25:47.604
And there's trouble all around ya

25:47.679 --> 25:51.615
When it seems like nothin'

25:51.683 --> 25:54.083
Is gonna turn out right

25:55.153 --> 25:58.452
When you just can't see

25:58.523 --> 26:01.651
Any silver linin'

26:01.726 --> 26:05.355
Put your hands together

26:05.430 --> 26:08.558
And just hold on tight

26:08.633 --> 26:10.897
He'll be there

26:10.969 --> 26:14.427
When you need some comfort

26:16.741 --> 26:21.576
There when you need a friend

26:23.148 --> 26:25.173
He'll be there

26:25.250 --> 26:27.241
When the darkness

26:27.319 --> 26:30.311
Is closin' all around ya

26:30.388 --> 26:33.186
But you gotta believe

26:33.258 --> 26:37.251
When you get down on your knees

26:37.329 --> 26:42.164
He'll be there
to make the sun shine again

26:44.002 --> 26:47.267
But ya gotta believe

26:47.339 --> 26:50.672
When you get down on your knees

26:50.742 --> 26:55.941
He'll be there
to make the sun shine again

26:57.682 --> 27:00.116
He'll be there to make

27:02.287 --> 27:05.552
The sun shine

27:07.192 --> 27:12.061
Again

27:21.940 --> 27:25.068
Poppie, if I live to be a hundred,
you'll never cease to amaze me.

27:26.978 --> 27:30.072
I love you.
Good night.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.249
Gee. That was kinda nice, Sam.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.758
Yeah, it was.

27:41.826 --> 27:45.592
Okay. Now, what do I have to learn next?

27:45.664 --> 27:47.598
Geometry.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.931
Geometry?
The geometry of the table.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.937
You can't sink a ball
until you've worked out the angles,

27:54.005 --> 27:56.098
specially on the--
the bank shots.

27:56.174 --> 27:59.439
The angle of incidence
equals the angle of reflection.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.376
Something like that.
Yeah.
Yeah!

28:01.446 --> 28:03.539
Once you've worked out the angles,
then all you have to know...

28:03.615 --> 28:06.209
is where to hit the cue ball
and how hard.

28:07.452 --> 28:10.046
That probably takes
a long time to learn.|

28:10.121 --> 28:12.055
It takes years.

28:12.123 --> 28:15.456
I wish there was some way
I could draw it out for you.

28:29.808 --> 28:32.800
All right. Give this a whirl.

28:41.052 --> 28:45.580
<i>Now, just hit the dot on the cue ball. </i>

28:45.657 --> 28:49.093
<i>Nice and smooth. </i>
<i>Your elbow's a hinge. </i>

28:49.160 --> 28:52.493
Medium-strong.
Go for it.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.227
Oh-ho,
what a pretty sound.|

29:01.239 --> 29:04.174
Pythagoras,
we are gonna shoot some pool!

29:51.389 --> 29:54.119
<i>Evenin', Magic. </i>
Evenin', Eddie.

29:55.326 --> 29:57.988
- What's your poison?
- <i> Nine ball, Sam. </i>

29:58.062 --> 30:00.053
That was always Magic's favorite.

30:01.266 --> 30:06.135
- Nine ball.
- Nine ball's a lucky man's game.
You feelin' lucky, Magic?

30:09.541 --> 30:12.442
- Grady.
- It's a pleasure.

30:12.510 --> 30:15.343
Y-Yes, sir, a real pleasure.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.052
It's already racked for nine ball.

30:24.455 --> 30:27.822
It's-It's always racked for nine ball, fool.

30:27.892 --> 30:29.826
That's Magic's game.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.427
Take him, Poppie.

30:41.139 --> 30:45.098
All right, nine ball is-- is the game.

30:45.176 --> 30:49.977
<i>It's the race, seven to heaven. </i>
<i>Winner take all, loser they take the fall. </i>

30:51.049 --> 30:55.042
Gentlemen, we lag for break.

31:00.191 --> 31:03.092
Now, Sam, you're kind of
on your own on the lag.

31:03.161 --> 31:07.996
Uh, just hit it
in the center really smooth,
and maybe we'll get lucky.

31:10.335 --> 31:12.326
Real smooth.

31:13.838 --> 31:15.829
<i>Smooth. </i>

31:26.117 --> 31:29.211
Magic breaks!

<i>Game's on now, y'all. </i>

31:35.693 --> 31:37.285
All right. Now, Sam,

31:37.362 --> 31:40.854
put the cue ball right there
at the end of the line.

31:42.400 --> 31:46.166
<i>Hit it right on the dot</i>
<i>and smooth. </i>

31:46.237 --> 31:48.330
<i>Hit right through it. </i>

31:50.642 --> 31:52.303
<i>Whoo!</i>
<i>All right. </i>

31:52.377 --> 31:55.813
Mercy, mercy!
Nine ball on the break!

31:55.880 --> 31:59.145
Loser jumps in the lake.
First game to Magic.

31:59.217 --> 32:00.946
Great shot, Sam.

32:01.019 --> 32:02.680
Luck.

32:03.988 --> 32:06.456
Nine ball's a lucky man's game.

32:06.524 --> 32:08.992
- <i>Did you hear what he said?</i>
- <i>He owned that one. </i>

33:27.238 --> 33:29.832
Better look alive.

33:41.853 --> 33:45.755
- Al.
- Uh-oh.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.953
- Hey?
- Damn.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.019
<i>Something's wrong with him. </i>

33:52.096 --> 33:54.462
Who's he talking to?
His cue.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.961
What's it sayin'?

34:02.607 --> 34:04.575
What's goin' on?

34:05.643 --> 34:07.577
You're gonna have to stall.

34:07.645 --> 34:10.239
Gooshie says that
there's an energy drain.

34:10.313 --> 34:13.306
The Pentagon is usurping
our power supply.

34:13.384 --> 34:15.045
For how long?

34:15.119 --> 34:19.579
Hey, Magic, come on!
This isn't a séance.

34:19.657 --> 34:23.956
Shut up, Eddie!
Poppie can talk to whoever he wants to!

34:24.027 --> 34:26.588
It's gonna take a while, Sam.

34:26.664 --> 34:29.599
They must be workin'
on their vacation plans
or something.

34:29.667 --> 34:32.261
I'm gonna go work on it.
You stall.

34:47.851 --> 34:50.616
I, uh--|

34:50.688 --> 34:52.781
I need to take a break.

34:52.857 --> 34:54.949
Ain't no breaks.

34:55.025 --> 34:59.087
If the old man wants to kick back
for a minute, that's fine with me.

34:59.163 --> 35:01.358
As hot as he's shootin',
let him take a break.

35:01.432 --> 35:04.424
<i>Maybe he'll cool off. </i>
Hmm.

35:04.502 --> 35:07.300
Five minutes.

35:07.371 --> 35:10.238
Uh-uh. No, no, no.
I-I'll keep her company, Magic.

35:10.308 --> 35:12.572
Thanks, Grady.
You okay, Poppie?

35:13.644 --> 35:16.078
Yeah. I just, uh-- I--

35:16.147 --> 35:19.742
I gotta splash a little water
on my eyes, that's all.

35:19.817 --> 35:22.718
Well, you go ahead.
You're doin' great, just great.

35:25.490 --> 35:27.515
G-Great.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.435
I want Magic
to go permanently cool.

35:40.505 --> 35:43.269
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of him.

35:43.341 --> 35:46.003
Not him, his stick.

35:47.011 --> 35:50.174
For what's King Arthur
without his Excalibur?

35:51.682 --> 35:53.616
Nothin'.
Good.

35:53.684 --> 35:55.709
Now go to the head of the class.

36:04.629 --> 36:08.395
<i>Yes, sir. </i>
<i>Alberta, you're the best. </i>

36:08.466 --> 36:11.060
Mmm!
You're just like Magic.

36:11.135 --> 36:15.538
Uh, you don't mind
if I talk to you too, do you?

36:15.606 --> 36:17.540
Oh. That's--
That's just what I thought.

36:17.608 --> 36:19.906
<i>Grady, my man. </i>

36:21.045 --> 36:23.570
Listen, Grady, uh,

36:23.648 --> 36:26.242
Magic wants to talk to you
in the alley.

36:26.317 --> 36:29.912
Oh, no, no. I thought
he went to the bathroom.

36:29.987 --> 36:31.921
Well, you thought wrong.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.926
Magic?

36:36.994 --> 36:39.588
Magic?

36:39.664 --> 36:41.996
Magic?

36:43.334 --> 36:45.325
Magic?

36:46.337 --> 36:48.862
Ma--
He's in the bathroom.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.431
See? That's what I said!

36:54.011 --> 36:56.946
- What you want?
- Alberta.

36:57.014 --> 36:58.948
No, no, no, no, no!

36:59.016 --> 37:00.950
No, no, no.|

37:01.018 --> 37:02.781
No, no! No, no! No--

37:07.391 --> 37:10.224
|

37:10.294 --> 37:12.558
Ooh, Lordy! This--
Grady.

37:18.102 --> 37:21.902
D-Don't worry about me.
He got Al-Alberta!

37:26.344 --> 37:28.676
Just wanted to look at it, Magic.

37:29.981 --> 37:32.745
Hmm. Breaks in the middle, don't it?

37:35.486 --> 37:37.613
Hand over Alberta.

37:37.688 --> 37:41.988
Sure, Magic. Sure.

37:42.059 --> 37:45.688
<i>Aw, gee. </i>

37:46.764 --> 37:49.927
I should have unscrewed it first,
shouldn't I?

37:50.001 --> 37:51.992
I'm sorry. Here.

37:56.407 --> 37:59.604
Don't even think about it,
old man.

37:59.677 --> 38:02.145
Oh! Aaah! Ooh!

38:06.951 --> 38:09.112
Ohhh.

38:23.467 --> 38:25.628
He shouldn't have done that
to Alberta.

38:29.307 --> 38:33.471
He-- He knows that now.

38:38.716 --> 38:42.584
Maybe it's past Magic's bedtime,
and he decided to call it quits.

38:42.653 --> 38:45.087
One thing Poppie'll never do is quit.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.750
Neither will I, baby.
Neither will I.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.986
Then you're gonna be a lonely child.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.427
Poppie!

38:54.498 --> 38:56.591
Grady, are you all right?
I'm fine.

38:56.667 --> 38:59.602
I'm fine. And don't worry,
I can fix her, Miss Violet.

38:59.670 --> 39:03.697
Not in time to finish this game.

39:03.774 --> 39:07.210
Grady, go pick me out a stick.

39:07.278 --> 39:09.212
Y-Yeah.

39:11.949 --> 39:14.543
My, my. What happened, Magic?
Did you have an accident?

39:16.287 --> 39:18.881
No, but your boy did.

39:18.956 --> 39:22.357
M-Magic whuped him silly,

39:22.426 --> 39:26.487
<i>just like he's gonna do you with my stick. </i>

39:30.634 --> 39:36.402
N-Now, now, now, Magic, listen,
she's not Alberta, but she's pretty good,

39:36.474 --> 39:39.637
and I know if you talk to her,
she'll listen.

39:40.978 --> 39:43.879
- Thank you, Grady.
- Shoot his lights out, Poppie!

39:43.948 --> 39:46.075
Y-Yeah.

39:46.150 --> 39:49.984
Does she have a name?
B-B-Bathsheba.

39:51.188 --> 39:55.215
Bathsheba.
That's a real pretty name.

39:55.292 --> 39:58.989
<i>Yeah. Yeah, it is. </i>
<i>Bathsheba. </i>

40:00.498 --> 40:03.228
You gonna shoot or hold a baptism?

40:17.481 --> 40:21.281
- You gonna heft that stick all night?
- You afraid to let him get the feel of it?

40:31.061 --> 40:34.087
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>The man is stallin'!</i>

40:34.165 --> 40:36.497
<i>Magic, take your time. </i>

40:51.282 --> 40:53.307
Quit smilin'
and let's make this combination.

40:53.384 --> 40:57.320
I could only get
two more minutes of power.
Now, hit it smooth.

41:00.057 --> 41:01.957
All right!
Rack 'em, Grady.

41:03.360 --> 41:06.818
<i>Game match. </i>
<i>That's six games to six. </i>

41:06.897 --> 41:08.990
Look like Eddie
better give up the stick.

41:10.901 --> 41:15.099
Now, just relax. Take deep breaths.
Don't panic.

41:15.172 --> 41:17.106
Al.
Yeah?

41:17.174 --> 41:20.701
- Tell me where to put the ball.
- Oh! The beam. Sorry.

41:20.778 --> 41:22.939
There you go. Put it there.

41:23.013 --> 41:26.676
Now, hit it smooth but hit it hard.
We wanna make a couple of balls
on the break.

41:29.887 --> 41:32.685
All right!|

41:48.806 --> 41:50.740
Okay, Sam,
now we sink the seven.

41:50.808 --> 41:53.743
Give it a little right English
so it'll slide off the rail
ready for the eight.

41:53.811 --> 41:56.644
Smooth. Nice.

41:56.714 --> 41:58.978
Well, you're in a little tough
on the eight.

41:59.049 --> 42:02.246
But that's okay. Left English,
bring it back with the nine ball.

42:02.319 --> 42:04.310
<i>Smooth. </i>

42:14.098 --> 42:16.794
-
- Ohhh.

42:19.169 --> 42:21.262
Aw.

42:21.338 --> 42:24.637
Well, you didn't scratch,
but you did snooker yourself.
But that's okay.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.642
<i>Sweet shot, now you're hot. </i>

42:26.710 --> 42:29.770
- Magic's on the nine.
- I told you to shut up!

42:29.847 --> 42:32.975
Well, tellin' don't mean doin'.

42:37.288 --> 42:39.813
Okay, we gotta go three rail, Sam,
to win the match.

42:39.890 --> 42:43.883
High English,
nice and smooth.

42:47.731 --> 42:49.596
- Uh-oh.
-

42:49.667 --> 42:51.464
<i>Uh-oh. </i>

42:52.536 --> 42:55.130
Come on, Gooshie!
Give me ten more seconds!

42:58.642 --> 43:01.167
<i>It's no good, Sam. </i>
<i>We had two minutes and it's gone. </i>

43:01.245 --> 43:03.236
- And it's my fault!
- No, it's not, Al.

43:03.314 --> 43:06.579
Y-You think
he's talkin' to B-Bathsheba?

43:07.585 --> 43:09.576
I hope so.
Mm.

43:09.653 --> 43:12.588
<i>You gonna shoot old man</i>
<i>or talk to the smoke?</i>

43:17.061 --> 43:19.222
Do it, Poppie.

43:23.334 --> 43:25.768
Nine ball.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.302
He'll never make this.
Mm-mmm.

44:25.996 --> 44:28.260
<i>You did it!</i>

44:32.336 --> 44:34.327
Go on.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.675
My marker.

45:07.104 --> 45:12.974
And I don't ever wanna see
your ugly face in my club again.

45:13.043 --> 45:15.102
Look, bitch, I--

45:25.322 --> 45:28.314
I believe my granddaughter
asked you to leave.

45:58.021 --> 46:01.081
Poppie, if I live to be a hundred--
I know, I know.

46:01.158 --> 46:03.149
I'll never cease--

46:10.634 --> 46:14.468
<i> </i>

<i>Don't mess up this time, Victor. </i>

46:16.373 --> 46:18.398
Ready?

46:21.078 --> 46:23.273
Here I come.

46:29.686 --> 46:31.677
Oh, boy!
