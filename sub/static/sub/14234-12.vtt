00:04.572 --> 00:05.938
Pull the remaining guards
off the posts

00:07.106 --> 00:09.374
Tell them to meet
in the boiler room.

00:09.442 --> 00:10.575
What for?

00:10.643 --> 00:12.444
My men will be waiting there
to disarm them.

00:12.512 --> 00:13.745
Nobody needs to get hurt.

00:13.812 --> 00:16.648
I'm not letting you
take over this prison.

Pull the guards.

00:30.696 --> 00:32.797
I can't.

00:32.865 --> 00:35.800
The order has to come
from the major.

00:35.868 --> 00:39.103
You can order a code eight
lockdown, though, can't you?

00:41.540 --> 00:45.843
I swear, if I have to eat
one more serving of that crap...

00:47.512 --> 00:49.947
Put the guns down
and get on the ground.

It doesn't matter how many
times you ask me the question.

00:57.722 --> 00:59.590
My response won't change.

00:59.658 --> 01:02.959
An invasion is inconsistent
with our philosophy.

01:03.027 --> 01:04.295
No matter the evidence?

01:04.361 --> 01:07.431
For all I know, you've
manufactured this evidence.

01:07.499 --> 01:10.934
We will not harm you,
because we cannot.

01:11.002 --> 01:13.571
To do so would invalidate
who we are as people,

01:13.638 --> 01:15.839
to compromise a moral center

01:15.907 --> 01:17.541
which forms the very basis
of our existence.

01:17.609 --> 01:18.909
What moral center?

01:18.976 --> 01:23.180
You murdered your boyfriend
on Sophia's orders.

01:26.517 --> 01:28.451
Yes.

01:28.519 --> 01:32.689
And I have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

01:36.026 --> 01:38.728
And if William had talked,
it would've only done harm.

01:43.867 --> 01:48.538
What about this?

01:48.606 --> 01:50.306
What did they do?

01:50.374 --> 01:52.308
What was their crime, hmm?

01:52.376 --> 01:54.744
My people would have never
done something like this.

01:54.811 --> 01:55.845
They did!

01:55.912 --> 01:58.248
Thomas did.

01:58.315 --> 02:00.249
Sophia said
he had different ideas

02:00.316 --> 02:01.650
about how to adapt,

02:01.718 --> 02:04.085
that he's less patient,
impulsive.

02:04.153 --> 02:06.421
Those are her words.

02:06.489 --> 02:09.591
Is it really so hard to believe

02:09.658 --> 02:13.662
he did this...

02:13.730 --> 02:16.431
And that the rest of you
are just as capable of it?

02:18.635 --> 02:19.868
[Door opens]

02:19.935 --> 02:21.436
I'm sorry, sir.
A code eight just went out.

02:21.504 --> 02:23.104
All detainees need to go
back to their cells,

02:23.172 --> 02:24.939
and all guards are to report
to the boiler room.

02:25.007 --> 02:26.007
What for?

02:26.075 --> 02:27.709
They said instructions
will follow.

02:27.777 --> 02:28.943
Probably just a drill.

02:29.011 --> 02:30.779
I'm not having
this interrogation interrupted

02:30.846 --> 02:32.581
- for a drill.
- But, sir...

02:32.649 --> 02:34.683
I'm the director
of National Intelligence.

02:34.751 --> 02:36.785
This is a matter
of national security.

02:36.852 --> 02:39.287
I'm overriding the order.

02:39.354 --> 02:41.422
Get back to your post, soldier.

02:41.490 --> 02:43.291
Yes, sir.

02:48.864 --> 02:51.032
This is corporal Bell,
sector three.

02:51.100 --> 02:54.335
I've got orders
to remain at my post, over.

02:56.605 --> 02:59.107
Corporal, I say again,
you are to report

02:59.175 --> 03:02.243
to the boiler room
A.S.A.P., over.

03:02.311 --> 03:05.013
Director Sterling
has countermanded the order,

03:05.080 --> 03:07.081
over.

03:07.149 --> 03:09.216
Director Sterling is here?

03:09.284 --> 03:11.084
I didn't know
about that, all right?

03:11.152 --> 03:14.922
The... the major would have made
those arrangements.

03:14.989 --> 03:17.925
Tell him to stay put.

03:17.992 --> 03:21.428
Roger that, corporal.
Keep to your post.

03:21.495 --> 03:24.264
- I want Sterling.
- We need to stay on schedule.

03:24.332 --> 03:25.966
We've got the numbers
and the firepower.

03:26.034 --> 03:27.767
Sterling is not a threat to us.

03:27.836 --> 03:29.937
Do you know what he's done
to our people,

03:30.004 --> 03:32.439
the methods he's used here?

03:32.506 --> 03:34.107
He has to pay.

03:36.577 --> 03:39.213
Tell me exactly where he is.

03:41.515 --> 03:44.951
[Softly]
Tell me.

03:45.018 --> 03:48.554
I don't know
what you want me to say.

03:48.621 --> 03:51.623
I haven't been in contact
with Sophia.

03:51.691 --> 03:53.893
I haven't been
in contact with Thomas.

03:53.961 --> 03:56.128
All I can tell you
is that what you're suggesting

03:56.196 --> 03:57.763
is not consistent with the...

03:57.831 --> 03:59.465
Consistent with your morality.

03:59.532 --> 04:00.967
Right.

04:01.034 --> 04:03.102
You can talk all day
about your oath.

04:03.170 --> 04:07.373
But the facts
tell a different story.

04:11.144 --> 04:15.248
What would it take,
Mr. Sterling....

04:15.315 --> 04:18.050
To make you believe me?

04:20.152 --> 04:22.421
At this stage,

if that's even possible.

- I don't know.

They're... they're in uniform,
but they're not stationed here.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.899
I-I never seen
them before.

05:07.966 --> 05:11.803
And... and the weapons,
they're not army issue.

05:11.870 --> 05:14.338
Give me your sidearm.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.217

of here alive, you know.

06:01.285 --> 06:02.786
Why are you here?

06:02.854 --> 06:05.188
We need our people back.

06:05.255 --> 06:07.491
You're here
to break out the prisoners?

- Yeah.

If they're roaming freely,
we have to assume

06:44.327 --> 06:47.663
they've gained control
of the guards in the prison.

We're not getting
out of here alive.

06:52.502 --> 06:54.102

from leaving here
with those prisoners.

at Inostranka?

07:53.998 --> 07:55.431
Has he been able
to find out anything

07:55.499 --> 07:57.033
that can help locate Thomas

Mr. President,
there's a problem.

08:23.793 --> 08:26.829
- What is it?
- Senator Lewis.

08:30.967 --> 08:33.836
You lied to me,
Mr. President.

08:33.903 --> 08:36.238
You led me to believe
that the Inostranka facility

08:36.306 --> 08:38.907
- was a weather station.
- That was my understanding.

08:38.975 --> 08:40.607
You're running a secret prison.

08:40.676 --> 08:42.409
You're incarcerating people

08:42.477 --> 08:45.347
without any of the protections
of the Geneva Convention.

08:45.414 --> 08:46.948
You're threatening
the moral authority

08:47.015 --> 08:48.249
of this entire administration...

08:48.317 --> 08:49.750
That information is classified

08:49.818 --> 08:51.785

obtained illegally,

is an offense punishable by law.

Well, unfortunately, senator,
all I can tell you

is that it's a matter
of national security.

to rid them of any meaning.

you've made
this country less secure.

the last 90 days

09:49.643 --> 09:52.946
you have left as senator
to help those people

09:53.014 --> 09:54.948
and leave matters
of national security

09:55.016 --> 09:58.584
to those of us
with actual credentials?

09:58.652 --> 10:00.720

you question my integrity,

10:00.788 --> 10:02.855
I will eviscerate yours.

13:22.751 --> 13:25.086
put in prisons...

13:25.154 --> 13:27.255
Hunted.

13:27.323 --> 13:29.424
But not you.

13:29.492 --> 13:31.759
A group of us escaped.

13:31.827 --> 13:35.263
We lived among the population.

13:35.331 --> 13:38.266
We made new lives for ourselves.

13:38.334 --> 13:40.835
And then I met your mother.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.106
I just wanted to protect you,

13:45.173 --> 13:46.774
keep you safe,

13:46.842 --> 13:49.543
so that no one would find out
what you really were.

13:54.016 --> 13:55.315
What am I?

13:59.454 --> 14:01.055
- What am I?
- You're my daughter.

14:01.123 --> 14:03.891
You're a part of me, and you're
a part of your mother.

14:13.969 --> 14:17.871
I'm not human...

14:17.938 --> 14:20.774
Am I?

14:25.980 --> 14:28.481
H-how different am I?

14:28.549 --> 14:31.584
I don't...
I don't feel different.

14:31.652 --> 14:33.352
I don't look different.

14:33.420 --> 14:35.155
You are.

14:37.591 --> 14:40.259
Sit down.

14:40.327 --> 14:43.029
I'm gonna tell you
everything in time, okay?

14:44.531 --> 14:48.868
I will answer all
the questions that you have.

14:48.936 --> 14:51.937
I want to know everything.

14:52.005 --> 14:54.540
And I will tell you everything.

14:54.608 --> 14:57.476
But you have to come with me.
We can't stay here.

14:57.544 --> 15:00.079
Of course
I'm gonna come with you.

15:00.146 --> 15:02.415
Well, I wish it were
as simple as that, but it's not.

15:02.482 --> 15:05.050
What do you mean?

15:05.118 --> 15:08.654
Sean can't come with us.

15:08.722 --> 15:10.656
He can't know
more than he already does.

15:10.724 --> 15:15.094
It'll place all
of our lives at risk.

15:15.161 --> 15:19.064
But everything he's done,
he's... he did for me.

15:19.132 --> 15:21.166
- He saved my life.
- I know.

15:21.234 --> 15:23.769
But this is Sophia's order.

15:23.837 --> 15:25.337
I don't take orders from Sophia.

15:25.404 --> 15:27.405
But I do.

15:29.308 --> 15:31.509
You'll have to choose...

15:31.577 --> 15:34.412
Either come with me
or stay here with Sean.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.315
There is no other way.

15:53.309 --> 15:57.111
Echo team, report.

15:57.179 --> 15:59.911
Echo team, have you secured
the target? Report.

16:00.669 --> 16:03.671
- No response.
- Something's wrong.

16:03.739 --> 16:06.140
Sterling must have gotten
away from them.

16:06.208 --> 16:07.942
Everyone is waiting for you, sir.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.777
- What do you want us to do?
- Send another team.

16:09.845 --> 16:13.146
- I want Sterling secured.
- We need to be airborne in 30.

16:13.214 --> 16:15.282
The next guard shift
will be coming in soon.

16:15.350 --> 16:18.518
Then you better be quick
about it.

16:18.586 --> 16:19.753
My friends!

16:19.820 --> 16:23.023
The time has come
for you to leave this place.

16:23.091 --> 16:24.324
- Yeah!
- All right!

16:24.392 --> 16:26.426
You have languished here
for far too long,

16:26.494 --> 16:28.762
as time and time again

16:28.829 --> 16:31.464
Sophia has failed
to negotiate your release.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.967
Even now...

16:34.035 --> 16:35.936
While she herself is free,

16:36.004 --> 16:38.705
she asks you to remain here.

16:38.773 --> 16:41.474
And for what?

16:41.542 --> 16:44.077
I say you should be free.

16:44.145 --> 16:45.712
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:45.780 --> 16:47.714
You should have a say
in your future.

16:47.782 --> 16:49.783
[Indistinct shouts]

16:49.850 --> 16:53.119
And for that reason,
I have split from Sophia.

16:53.186 --> 16:57.123
I will no longer take her orders

16:57.190 --> 17:00.827
and neither will you
if you come with me.

17:05.665 --> 17:07.534
I should take a look
at that wound, sir.

17:07.601 --> 17:10.804
Not now. Let's... let's just get
to the command room.

17:10.871 --> 17:13.339
We have to notify the outside.

17:13.406 --> 17:15.775
Someone's inside.

17:15.843 --> 17:18.912
Do you recognize him?

17:21.213 --> 17:23.781
No.
Must be one of theirs.

17:23.849 --> 17:26.518
How do you want to do this?

17:37.029 --> 17:39.698
[Knock on door]

17:44.370 --> 17:46.805
Get his gun.

17:50.577 --> 17:53.644
Major Pearson.

17:53.712 --> 17:56.647
Corporal, the gun.

18:03.322 --> 18:05.490
Phones are down.

18:05.557 --> 18:07.192
Try the base comm.

18:10.162 --> 18:12.430
Dead.

18:21.207 --> 18:23.708
[Breathlessly]
Corporal, the first-aid kit.

18:27.445 --> 18:29.680
Help me.

18:31.449 --> 18:33.117
Okay, okay.
Easy there.

18:35.020 --> 18:36.521
All right.

18:36.588 --> 18:39.056
Okay.

18:40.626 --> 18:42.593
This is bad, sir.

18:42.661 --> 18:45.730
All right, just pack
the wound and tape it up tight.

18:45.797 --> 18:48.966
If there's a chemical hemostat
in there, use it.

18:52.470 --> 18:55.139
Sir.

18:58.076 --> 18:59.977
Oh.

19:07.652 --> 19:10.587
If we can't get word
to the outside,

19:10.655 --> 19:13.057
we're gonna have to try
to keep them in here.

19:13.124 --> 19:14.558
There's only...
there's only two of us, sir.

19:14.625 --> 19:16.660
What are we supposed to do?

19:18.496 --> 19:21.231
[Breathing heavily]

19:21.299 --> 19:24.101
There has to be
a fail-safe.

19:24.169 --> 19:26.270
Is there...

19:26.337 --> 19:27.904
A way to lock down every sector?

19:27.972 --> 19:29.673
Yes, there's
a perimeter override,

19:29.740 --> 19:32.109
but I don't have the clearance.

19:32.177 --> 19:34.678
But maybe you do, sir.

19:39.850 --> 19:42.786
Sir, I-if we...
if we do this,

19:42.853 --> 19:46.456
it'll not only trap
them inside...

19:46.523 --> 19:50.026
It'll trap us inside with them.

19:52.029 --> 19:55.498
I'm aware of that, corporal.

19:55.566 --> 19:58.334
I understand that all of you

19:58.402 --> 20:01.270
have served Sophia
for a very long time.

20:01.338 --> 20:03.139
But she's asked you

20:03.207 --> 20:06.075
to put the interests
of the humans before your own.

20:06.142 --> 20:08.410
I believe it is time

20:08.478 --> 20:10.646
that we protect our own.

20:10.714 --> 20:11.814
[Crowd agreements]

20:11.881 --> 20:15.150
I believe it is they
who should serve us.

20:15.218 --> 20:16.952
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

20:17.020 --> 20:20.555
But if you believe
in Sophia, then stay.

20:20.624 --> 20:22.357
Go back to your cells

20:22.425 --> 20:26.996
and enjoy waiting
another 66 years.

20:27.063 --> 20:28.664
[All murmur]

20:28.732 --> 20:30.966
Those of you who wish to be free

20:31.034 --> 20:32.334
come with me now.

20:32.401 --> 20:35.671
Plans to make a place
for ourselves in this world

20:35.739 --> 20:38.506
are already underway.

20:38.573 --> 20:41.408
The choice is yours.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.889
Maya, we're gonna stay.

20:54.957 --> 20:56.691
Join us.

20:56.759 --> 20:58.993
I don't know
if that's a good idea.

20:59.061 --> 21:01.595
We have to stay here to show
our solidarity with Sophia.

21:01.664 --> 21:03.297
No, we have to be smart.

21:03.365 --> 21:05.066
We don't know
what Thomas is up to

21:05.134 --> 21:06.801
or what he's capable of.

21:06.869 --> 21:10.204
This is not the right time
to go against him.

21:28.223 --> 21:29.990
Maya...

21:30.058 --> 21:31.892
I'm glad to see you're with us.

21:31.959 --> 21:34.195
I imagine it was
a difficult decision.

21:34.262 --> 21:36.830
Not at all.

21:36.898 --> 21:38.332
You...

21:38.400 --> 21:41.768
Open the door.

21:51.044 --> 21:53.879
They're at the loading docks
at sector four.

21:53.947 --> 21:57.917
That... that door
leads out to the helipad.

22:07.361 --> 22:08.595
Door's opening.

22:08.662 --> 22:11.931
We got to hurry, sir.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.465
Come on, come on.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.948
Yes.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.416
Yes.

22:31.484 --> 22:34.319
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

22:34.387 --> 22:35.654
Open the damn door.

22:35.722 --> 22:38.290
I can't.
The codes are not working.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.792
Somebody must have reset
the system.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.294
How?

22:43.362 --> 22:45.797
From the command room...

22:45.865 --> 22:49.433
And only by an officer
with the highest clearance.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.736
Sterling.
The command room, go.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.772
Send everyone.
Arm them if you have to.

22:53.839 --> 22:56.440
But make it clear,
I need Sterling alive.

22:56.508 --> 22:58.376
Yes, sir.
Let's go.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.592
Bravo One, where are you?

23:14.660 --> 23:17.027
Report.

23:17.095 --> 23:19.663
Help me up.
We have to move.

23:21.699 --> 23:23.600
Oh, God.

23:23.668 --> 23:26.770
He's sending more.
He's sending more.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.506
Let's go, corporal.

23:31.342 --> 23:33.977
We can only dodge them
for so long.

23:34.045 --> 23:36.746
Take us to the armory.

23:36.815 --> 23:39.149
It's gonna be all right, sir.
We're almost there.

23:39.217 --> 23:41.251
Sir.

23:53.931 --> 23:57.566
They're detainees.

24:05.542 --> 24:07.243
Hold up.

24:16.519 --> 24:18.855
Who did this to you?

24:20.490 --> 24:22.658
[Weakly]
Thomas.

24:24.627 --> 24:26.695
I don't understand, sir.

24:26.763 --> 24:29.998
Why would he do this
to his own people?

24:30.066 --> 24:32.934
These aren't his people.

24:33.002 --> 24:34.737
They're Sophia's.

24:37.507 --> 24:40.876
This isn't just a prison break.

24:40.943 --> 24:42.478
It's a coup d'etat.

24:42.545 --> 24:45.080
Turn around slowly!
Hands in the air!

24:45.147 --> 24:47.249
Drop 'em now!

24:47.316 --> 24:49.232
Drop 'em!
Let's go!

25:03.821 --> 25:05.554
Good evening, I'm
Chris Matthews in Washington.

25:05.622 --> 25:06.889
Transparency in government...

25:07.859 --> 25:10.398
Why do politicians promise
to turn on the lights,

25:10.399 --> 25:12.767
yet continue to keep us
in the dark?

25:12.835 --> 25:15.770
My guest tonight is senator
Catherine Lewis of Alaska.

25:15.838 --> 25:17.806
Senator Lewis
inherited her senate seat

25:17.873 --> 25:19.140
when her late husband,

25:19.208 --> 25:21.910
the legendary
six-term senator Bernard Lewis,

25:21.978 --> 25:23.244
passed away this month.

25:23.312 --> 25:25.981
- My condolences.
- Thank you, Chris.

25:26.048 --> 25:27.749
But as the proverb says,

25:27.817 --> 25:30.652
"Good men must die, but nothing
can kill their name."

25:30.720 --> 25:32.621
And I'm living proof of that.

25:32.688 --> 25:34.923
I vowed to champion
my husband's causes,

25:34.991 --> 25:37.726
the foremost of which
is transparency in government.

25:37.793 --> 25:39.193
Speaking of which, I understand

25:39.261 --> 25:41.662
you've made some shocking
discoveries since taking office.

25:41.730 --> 25:42.730
I have.

25:42.797 --> 25:44.397
And the most shocking thing
about it

25:44.465 --> 25:46.466
is that they're
in my own backyard.

25:46.534 --> 25:48.636
I've discovered
a secret government program

25:48.703 --> 25:49.837
that's been siphoning

25:49.904 --> 25:52.572
hundreds of millions
of dollars every year.

25:52.641 --> 25:54.474
Did you know that Alaska

25:54.542 --> 25:57.344
has the highest rate
of unemployment in the country,

25:57.411 --> 25:59.913
a statewide epidemic
of childhood obesity?

25:59.981 --> 26:02.315
- This is live?
- Get me MSNBC.

26:02.383 --> 26:04.317
Get me senator Lewis' aide.

26:04.385 --> 26:05.986
Hell, get me Lewis, now.

26:06.054 --> 26:08.055
Those are my words.
She's using them against me.

26:08.123 --> 26:09.489
...A highly classified
secret program,

26:09.557 --> 26:12.660
what it's called and what it is,
when we come back.

26:12.727 --> 26:14.461
She had 90 days left as senator.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.163
She has nothing to lose
by releasing this.

26:16.230 --> 26:17.797
And if she does,
everything will come out...

26:17.865 --> 26:19.432
Not only the existence
of Sophia's people,

26:19.500 --> 26:21.334
but the message
that more of them are coming.

26:21.402 --> 26:23.036
Sir, I don't know
what we can do at this point.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.871
We can't shut the broadcast down.

26:24.938 --> 26:27.907
I've got senator Lewis
on line one.

26:31.179 --> 26:34.548
[Phone rings]

26:34.615 --> 26:36.683
Excuse me, Chris.

26:36.750 --> 26:38.518
This is senator Lewis.

26:38.586 --> 26:40.587
What kind of game
are you playing?

26:42.190 --> 26:43.990
You inspired me.

26:44.058 --> 26:45.958
I'm just standing up
for my constituents

26:46.026 --> 26:47.460
just like you said I should.

26:47.528 --> 26:50.596
You have no idea what kind of
Pandora's box you are opening.

26:50.664 --> 26:53.800
Then tell me what's in it,
and maybe I'll leave it shut.

26:53.867 --> 26:55.802
You'll stop talking if I tell you

26:55.869 --> 26:57.970
who the Inostranka prisoners are?

26:58.038 --> 27:00.073
- That's right.
- Back in one.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.474
What do you say,
Mr. President?

27:06.113 --> 27:08.881
- Your husband knew.
- Excuse me?

27:08.949 --> 27:11.317
He knew...
Your husband, everything.

27:11.384 --> 27:15.154
He knew what Inostranka was,
who was held there and why.

27:15.222 --> 27:16.555
And he let it go,

27:16.623 --> 27:19.158
because he knew it was
the right thing to do.

27:19.226 --> 27:20.492
You're lying.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.127
If you want to honor his legacy,

27:22.195 --> 27:24.162
you'll let it go too.

27:24.230 --> 27:25.330
Back in 30.

27:25.397 --> 27:27.232
Senator.

27:27.299 --> 27:30.168
Tell me what Inostranka is,

27:30.236 --> 27:31.903
and when I go back on the air,

27:31.971 --> 27:34.005
I'll start throwing softballs
instead of grenades.

27:34.073 --> 27:35.240
Don't tell me,

27:35.307 --> 27:38.476
and I'm gonna blow
Pandora's box wide open.

27:40.179 --> 27:41.980
Back in ten.

27:42.048 --> 27:44.515
Clock is ticking,
Mr. President.

27:52.058 --> 27:55.794
Five, four, three, two...

27:55.862 --> 27:58.929
Deal.

27:58.997 --> 28:00.297
We're back.

28:00.365 --> 28:03.134
My guest tonight, senator Lewis,
made a shocking discovery

28:03.201 --> 28:05.502
when she found evidence
of a secret government program.

28:05.570 --> 28:09.306
She's here to tell us what it is.

28:09.374 --> 28:11.242
What it is...

28:11.309 --> 28:12.542
Is a travesty.

28:12.610 --> 28:15.946
There are dozens
of other programs and earmarks

28:16.014 --> 28:17.514
and special interests

28:17.582 --> 28:21.385
all taking money from ordinary
taxpaying citizens.

28:21.452 --> 28:24.054
But what can you tell us about
this program in particular?

28:24.122 --> 28:26.657
What I can tell you...

28:26.724 --> 28:28.159
Is that as long as transparency

28:28.226 --> 28:30.594
remains a low-profile
in the Senate,

28:30.662 --> 28:32.396
a lot of us
are gonna get left behind.

28:32.463 --> 28:34.998
I know you're a senator now,
but...

28:35.065 --> 28:37.000
You kept her quiet.

28:37.067 --> 28:40.270
For now.

28:40.338 --> 28:42.539
God help us
when we tell her the truth.

28:46.911 --> 28:48.945
Get some sleep, sweetheart, okay?

28:49.013 --> 28:52.015
- I love you.
- I love you.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.168
[Sighs]

29:13.236 --> 29:15.471
What do you mean
I can't go with you?

29:15.539 --> 29:18.507
He said I can stay with you,
or I can go with him,

29:18.575 --> 29:20.743
- and you can't come.
- Why not?

29:20.811 --> 29:22.478
- I don't understand.
- There's things.

29:22.546 --> 29:25.881
There's things that he said...
things you can't know.

29:25.949 --> 29:28.317
Okay, Leila, Leila.

29:28.385 --> 29:31.086
Look at me, all right?

29:31.154 --> 29:33.989
I don't care what your father is

29:34.057 --> 29:35.991
or who Sophia is or any of it.

29:36.059 --> 29:40.495
I just care about you,
and I'm not leaving you.

29:40.563 --> 29:42.330
You don't care what I am?

29:42.398 --> 29:43.965
No.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.834
You don't care
that I'm not human?

29:45.901 --> 29:46.835
[Sighs]

29:46.902 --> 29:48.236
- That hasn't fazed you?
- Stop.

29:48.303 --> 29:49.804
No.

29:51.674 --> 29:55.710
Then why haven't you touched me?

29:55.778 --> 29:58.179
Since I told you...

29:58.247 --> 30:01.082
You haven't touched me.

30:07.256 --> 30:09.323
I'm sorry.

30:15.597 --> 30:17.931
I'm sorry.

30:20.101 --> 30:24.104
I'm just...
I'm just trying to...

30:30.912 --> 30:32.546
You want to go...

30:32.614 --> 30:35.215
Right?

30:35.283 --> 30:37.885
- Do you want to go?
- No.

30:37.952 --> 30:40.888
I don't.
I don't, but I...

30:42.724 --> 30:44.792
I just...
it's like I-I feel empty,

30:44.859 --> 30:48.528
and my dad is the only person

30:48.595 --> 30:50.596
who can fill in those blanks.

30:54.468 --> 30:55.802
Okay.

30:59.339 --> 31:02.374
You should go.

31:02.443 --> 31:03.776
- Sean.
- No, no, no.

31:03.844 --> 31:06.312
Just... just go.

31:06.379 --> 31:08.481
I can't just...

31:08.549 --> 31:10.950
Leave you.

31:11.017 --> 31:14.186
I can't just leave
you behind. I...

31:18.224 --> 31:20.025
You're a part of me.

31:22.062 --> 31:24.630
And without you...

31:24.698 --> 31:27.732
- I have nothing.
- Okay.

31:27.800 --> 31:30.502
- Okay, okay.
- How do I... How do I choose?

31:30.570 --> 31:32.170
- How do I choose?
- I don't know. I don't know.

31:32.237 --> 31:34.372
- I don't know.
- I don't... What do I do?

31:34.440 --> 31:36.675
You know what?
Let's just go to sleep, okay?

31:36.742 --> 31:38.510
- Let's just go to sleep.
- I can't.

31:38.578 --> 31:41.446
Yes, just try, okay?
Just try.

31:41.514 --> 31:42.981
Let's go to sleep,

31:43.048 --> 31:45.316
and we'll figure it out
tomorrow, okay?

31:45.384 --> 31:48.820
Okay?

32:11.223 --> 32:13.457
Aah!

32:15.127 --> 32:18.595
I'm taking my people out of here.

32:18.663 --> 32:19.997
Why do you need them?

32:20.065 --> 32:23.234
You've already got
others coming, don't you?

32:24.874 --> 32:27.610
That's right.
We translated the message.

32:28.020 --> 32:29.488
How many are coming?

32:30.045 --> 32:31.132
When are they coming?

32:31.312 --> 32:34.248
Aah!

32:35.414 --> 32:38.350
I know you changed
the code to the gate.

32:38.417 --> 32:41.919
Tell me the new one,
and nobody else has to die.

32:44.061 --> 32:47.829
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:47.897 --> 32:52.501
Then it's gonna be a long
and painful night for you.

32:56.573 --> 32:58.440
Aah!

32:58.508 --> 32:59.675
[Grunts]

33:01.444 --> 33:02.878
[Seethes]

33:02.945 --> 33:05.013
[Grunting]

33:12.121 --> 33:13.822
Aah!

33:16.326 --> 33:19.227
There's nothing you can do to me.

33:19.296 --> 33:22.263
I'm the only one
who knows the code.

33:22.331 --> 33:24.432
And you'll never get it
out of me.

33:24.500 --> 33:28.068
[Screaming]

33:28.136 --> 33:30.371
[Whimpers]

33:30.439 --> 33:32.840
You took away their freedom.

33:32.908 --> 33:36.043
I'm gonna get it back for them.

33:36.111 --> 33:38.346
It's what they deserve.

33:38.414 --> 33:41.783
And what about the detainees
that you had executed...

33:44.019 --> 33:46.721
The ones who were loyal
to Sophia?

33:46.789 --> 33:48.790
- Shut up!
- Is that what they deserved?

33:48.857 --> 33:50.124
Aaaah!

33:50.192 --> 33:52.293
[Whimpering]

33:52.361 --> 33:57.030
If the next thing out
of your mouth isn't the code,

33:57.097 --> 34:00.634
I will cover this room
with your blood.

34:00.702 --> 34:02.268
Do it already!

34:02.337 --> 34:05.605
[Screaming]

34:07.342 --> 34:10.043
[Gun cocks]
Last chance.

34:10.110 --> 34:11.878
Wait, wait!
Don't do it!

34:11.946 --> 34:13.580
I have the code.

34:13.648 --> 34:15.716
Don't listen to him.
He's lying.

34:15.783 --> 34:17.217
I have the code.
I have it!

34:17.284 --> 34:19.786
I saw him program the system!

34:22.623 --> 34:24.958
Untie him.

34:33.367 --> 34:35.934
No, not him.
He comes with us.

34:36.002 --> 34:37.936
Let's go!

34:38.004 --> 34:41.741
[Helicopter powering up]

34:59.259 --> 35:01.726
Come on, come on!

35:01.794 --> 35:03.728
Let's go, let's go!

35:24.550 --> 35:26.985
You have to stop Thomas.

35:27.053 --> 35:31.323
What he wants will destroy you,
but please believe me...

35:31.391 --> 35:34.792
We don't all want this.

35:34.859 --> 35:36.794
Run.

35:36.861 --> 35:38.329
Let's go, let's go!

35:38.397 --> 35:40.064
Come on, let's go!
We're taking off!

36:18.802 --> 36:22.638
We have to go!
The next shift is coming!

36:41.557 --> 36:43.492
Hold on.

36:43.559 --> 36:44.994
Just hold on.

36:45.061 --> 36:48.330
There's help on the way.

36:48.398 --> 36:51.633
Believe me.

37:30.205 --> 37:32.206
Sean?

37:39.381 --> 37:41.382
Sean?

37:50.224 --> 37:52.225
Sean?

37:53.695 --> 37:56.229
Sean?

38:30.965 --> 38:34.133
[Knock on door]
Hello, Dr. Dempsey.

38:34.201 --> 38:36.636
I'm sorry to have to bother you.

38:36.704 --> 38:38.304
Oh, no, no.
Don't be silly.

38:38.371 --> 38:41.474
I was concerned
when I heard that you'd called.

38:41.541 --> 38:43.977
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

38:44.044 --> 38:46.479
But I'm afraid Leila Buchanan
and her boyfriend

38:46.546 --> 38:48.947
were able to find and free
the test subjects.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.654
I see.

39:18.077 --> 39:20.546
The boy, what's his name?

39:20.614 --> 39:22.681
Sean Walker.

39:22.749 --> 39:25.416
Walker.

39:32.691 --> 39:34.025
There you are.

39:36.928 --> 39:41.732
You know, when you get to be
as old as I am,

39:41.800 --> 39:45.637
the lines between
the past, the present,

39:45.704 --> 39:47.805
and the future...

39:47.873 --> 39:50.542
They begin to blur.

39:50.609 --> 39:54.646
Sir, I'm not sure that I follow.

39:54.713 --> 39:56.514
Oh, forgive me.

39:56.582 --> 39:58.549
I-I shouldn't expect
you to understand.

39:58.616 --> 40:01.752
It's just that I have a feeling

40:01.820 --> 40:04.221
that this Mr. Walker and I

40:04.289 --> 40:07.457
will cross paths again...

40:15.867 --> 40:17.801
Soon.
