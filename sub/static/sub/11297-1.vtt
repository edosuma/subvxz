Oh, God!

00:56.392 --> 01:00.330
Please, someone help us!

01:28.532 --> 01:32.480
Someone help us!

01:32.482 --> 01:34.440
Shelby?

01:34.442 --> 01:37.480
- No, no!
- It's going to be okay.

01:37.482 --> 01:40.550
Ma'am, we're gonna
take care of your baby.

01:54.530 --> 01:56.550
- What do you need?
- My wife.

01:56.552 --> 01:59.380
- Your wife is missing?
- Her picture. Her photo.

01:59.382 --> 02:02.430
It's all I have left of her.

02:02.432 --> 02:03.530
Help this man find his wife.

<i>Thank you for the
gift of this bread,</i>

03:47.492 --> 03:50.380
<i>to sustain these vessels, our bodies,</i>

03:50.382 --> 03:54.430
so that we may have the energy
to create a more beautiful world

03:54.432 --> 03:57.470
and break through our blocks
and barriers in this life

03:57.472 --> 04:00.540
and ascend The Ladder of Enlightenment,

04:00.542 --> 04:05.410
so that someday we may be
free of these earthly forms

04:05.412 --> 04:08.410
and live as Light
together in The Garden.

04:08.412 --> 04:12.550
We express deepest gratitude
for this day, and every day,

04:12.552 --> 04:15.330
for the gift of this passage,

04:15.332 --> 04:17.430
and that we have found The Ladder.

04:17.432 --> 04:21.420
There is one Spirit whose name is Truth.

04:21.422 --> 04:23.450
- Now let's eat.
- Yes.

04:23.452 --> 04:25.440
I'm so psyched Cal's gonna be with us.

04:25.442 --> 04:26.540
- Yes!
- And do you know how long

04:26.542 --> 04:28.380
- he's staying, Sarah?
- For a while.

04:28.382 --> 04:29.430
At least until Steve is done writing.

04:29.432 --> 04:31.370
Who made this incredible lasagna?

04:31.372 --> 04:32.520
He made the pasta from scratch.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.490
It tastes much better than
what you get in the store.

04:34.492 --> 04:37.330
You have been on such a
cooking jag lately, sweetie.

04:37.332 --> 04:39.540
- I find it meditative.
- I find eating meditative.

04:39.542 --> 04:41.440
Of course you do.

04:41.442 --> 04:43.470
When you get married,
marry a man who can cook.

04:43.472 --> 04:46.330
Uh, she doesn't get I am never
getting married, 'cause I have

04:46.332 --> 04:48.350
aspirations to go all
the way up The Ladder.

04:48.352 --> 04:49.550
- Oh, well.
- I'm so jealous.

04:49.552 --> 04:51.390
- I wish I could start.
- Hey,

04:51.392 --> 04:52.500
you're almost there. Be patient.

04:52.502 --> 04:54.470
Let's not forget to
send energy and Light

04:54.472 --> 04:57.440
to the people in New
Hampshire suffering tonight.

04:57.442 --> 04:59.370
To the victims of the tornado.

04:59.372 --> 05:01.380
Energy and Light.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.560
What's going on here?

05:09.562 --> 05:11.510
Nothing.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.540
Come on.

05:12.542 --> 05:15.390
You're upset about something.

05:15.392 --> 05:17.350
Eddie.

05:17.352 --> 05:21.350
Ever since he got back from
Peru, he's been different.

05:21.352 --> 05:22.520
Different?

05:22.522 --> 05:25.480
Distant.

05:25.482 --> 05:27.490
There were women on the retreat.

05:27.492 --> 05:29.380
Yes.

05:29.382 --> 05:30.440
Why would you even go there?

05:30.442 --> 05:32.370
Because you were going there, sweetie,

05:32.372 --> 05:34.480
even if you don't know it,
it's where you were going.

05:34.482 --> 05:38.350
6R. I love that retreat.

05:38.352 --> 05:39.560
It just like...

05:39.562 --> 05:42.360
- Just opened me.
- Open, definitely.

05:42.362 --> 05:43.480
That's the word for it.

05:43.482 --> 05:45.460
Made me more aware of everything.

05:45.462 --> 05:49.350
So... how was it?

05:49.352 --> 05:52.490
It was, uh... it was good.

05:52.492 --> 05:54.500
It was good.

06:05.510 --> 06:07.470
Hey, did you notice that Nicole

06:07.472 --> 06:09.510
was being a little hostile tonight?

06:09.512 --> 06:14.360
Well, I tell you what. She
did not want that fifth kid.

06:14.362 --> 06:17.360
I mean, your brother's
like a freaking Hasid.

06:17.362 --> 06:18.380
Grows ranks by birth.

06:18.382 --> 06:20.420
I mean I don't blame her.

06:20.422 --> 06:23.360
I'd be hostile with
a... With a third kid.

06:35.430 --> 06:37.390
You know what?

06:37.392 --> 06:41.480
I have to go finish up
some work, but I'll be...

06:41.482 --> 06:45.370
Oh, what is... what is that?

06:45.372 --> 06:47.530
A slip.

06:47.532 --> 06:51.530
- No, I know it's...
- How does it look?

06:51.532 --> 06:54.450
I mean, I probably haven't worn
it since before Summer was born,

06:54.452 --> 06:57.340
and my boobs were so much better then.

07:00.430 --> 07:03.350
It looks great.

07:03.352 --> 07:05.380
You...

07:05.382 --> 07:07.460
you look great.

07:10.400 --> 07:14.490
And your boobs...

07:14.492 --> 07:17.440
are great.

07:27.402 --> 07:30.400
Do you have to get that?

07:30.402 --> 07:32.450
Yes.

07:36.460 --> 07:38.520
Mm.

07:51.460 --> 07:53.360
No, no, no, no, no.

07:53.362 --> 07:57.480
Keep it on.

07:57.482 --> 07:59.550
- Oh!
- Oh.

07:59.552 --> 08:02.510
Oh, I missed you.

08:02.512 --> 08:06.490
I love you.

08:06.492 --> 08:08.390
Mm.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.340
Great work today, everybody.

08:43.342 --> 08:44.490
Now get 'em fed. Get 'em beds.

08:44.492 --> 08:47.360
Get 'em whatever they need.

08:47.362 --> 08:49.510
Come on. In we go.

10:01.442 --> 10:03.330
How about you tell me something?

10:03.332 --> 10:06.560
Tell me something so I
know that this is real.

10:06.562 --> 10:10.500
Okay.

10:10.502 --> 10:13.340
My turn.

10:13.342 --> 10:16.480
I think that I am having doubts.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.450
- Morning, Sarah.
- Good morning, Isaiah.

11:18.452 --> 11:19.500
Did everyone get in okay last night?

11:19.502 --> 11:21.400
Great. Place is crackling today.

11:21.402 --> 11:23.350
Great.

11:25.460 --> 11:27.490
- Have a good one.
- You too.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.320
- Hey, Abby.
- Hi, Sarah.

11:50.532 --> 11:53.330
- All right, I'll see ya.
- Bye, Cal.

11:53.332 --> 11:55.410
Sarah.

11:55.412 --> 11:57.520
Cal, you're here.

11:57.522 --> 12:00.440
I'm here.

12:00.442 --> 12:02.380
Oh, good to see you.

12:02.382 --> 12:03.480
Good to see you.

12:03.482 --> 12:05.520
I somehow managed to avoid
the East Coast winters

12:05.522 --> 12:08.350
for three years, and now I'm here.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.440
You're gonna have to be my little ray

12:09.442 --> 12:11.440
of California sunshine.

12:11.442 --> 12:13.400
Oh, God. Please don't tell me
you're already flirting with me.

12:13.402 --> 12:16.330
Of course not. I would
never flirt with you.

12:16.332 --> 12:19.320
Speaking of which, how's Eddie?

12:19.322 --> 12:20.410
He's great.

12:20.412 --> 12:22.500
- He just got back from 6R.
- Oh, nice.

12:22.502 --> 12:23.510
God, he must be flying.

12:23.512 --> 12:26.470
Yeah.

12:26.472 --> 12:28.480
What?

12:28.482 --> 12:31.500
Nothing.

12:31.502 --> 12:33.400
You're sad, Sarah.

12:33.402 --> 12:35.480
No, I'm not.

12:35.482 --> 12:37.480
I just didn't sleep well last night.

12:37.482 --> 12:40.370
All right, well...

12:40.372 --> 12:42.420
I'm always here for you, even
if you did break my heart.

12:42.422 --> 12:44.340
Oh, God. Hey.

12:44.342 --> 12:45.450
I'm sorry. It's reflex.

12:45.452 --> 12:47.300
On that note, I'm gonna let you go,

12:47.302 --> 12:50.410
but later, I want to hear everything.

12:50.412 --> 12:52.490
How Doc is doing, how
the book is coming along.

12:52.492 --> 12:54.530
That's all great.

12:54.532 --> 12:58.410
He's in lockdown right now, writing.

12:58.412 --> 13:00.320
I'll tell you all about
it in the meeting later.

13:00.322 --> 13:01.480
Okay.

13:01.482 --> 13:03.510
It is really good to see you, Sarah.

13:03.512 --> 13:05.530
You tell Eddie that I'm
gonna come stalk you guys.

13:05.532 --> 13:07.380
It's gonna be like old times.

13:07.382 --> 13:09.350
Three of us up all
night fixing the world.

13:09.352 --> 13:13.380
Except now we're in bed by
8:30, you miserable bachelor.

13:13.382 --> 13:15.440
All right.

13:30.402 --> 13:33.390
Hey, are we gonna work
on the car this weekend?

13:33.392 --> 13:37.340
Mustang's not gonna run on corn, Dad.

13:37.342 --> 13:40.490
Sure it is.

13:40.492 --> 13:43.470
Hey, why all the doom and gloom?

13:48.522 --> 13:51.530
I don't know.

13:51.532 --> 13:53.520
Look, it's just for a few more months.

13:53.522 --> 13:55.530
Four months.

13:55.532 --> 14:00.350
I won't be 16 for four months.

14:00.352 --> 14:02.430
Doc asks us to wait for a reason.

14:02.432 --> 14:04.330
But Mom's 8R.

14:04.332 --> 14:06.330
I know Dr. Meyer will
let me take my vows early.

14:06.332 --> 14:10.380
I... I just want to
get out of this place.

14:10.382 --> 14:13.380
Just hang in there, kid.

14:33.380 --> 14:35.330
That's right. Just release it.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.520
The pain of last week,

14:36.522 --> 14:39.340
last year, ten years ago.

14:43.300 --> 14:46.350
Now go out into the day, free
of the past, free of pain.

14:46.352 --> 14:50.410
Go into today with Light in your hearts.

14:50.412 --> 14:51.490
One last breath.

14:53.442 --> 14:55.330
Yeah!

14:59.452 --> 15:01.450
Whoo!

15:01.452 --> 15:04.360
Hey. Sean, Sean Egan.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.410
- First year Novice.
- Mary.

15:06.412 --> 15:07.530
Mary, welcome.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.310
Are you comfortable?
Do you need anything?

15:13.310 --> 15:15.340
Are you sick?

15:15.342 --> 15:18.300
I'll let someone know.

15:22.320 --> 15:26.300
- What's her name?
- Mary.

15:26.302 --> 15:28.500
Hello. Mary, is it?

15:28.502 --> 15:30.480
How are you feeling today?

15:30.482 --> 15:32.530
Fine.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.510
This'll help.

15:38.512 --> 15:40.400
How do you know what I have?

15:40.402 --> 15:43.310
We get a lot of people
in here in your condition.

15:43.312 --> 15:46.470
It's buprenorphine. It
helps with the withdrawal.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.300
We're gonna bring you back, Mary.

15:54.380 --> 15:56.510
Back to the self you once were.

15:56.512 --> 15:59.330
Before all the damage.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.370
Hey, man, I'll come join you later.

16:11.372 --> 16:12.470
Sit in on your testimonial.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.490
Oh, no. You don't have to do that.

16:14.492 --> 16:16.510
Same old story. You've
heard it a million times.

16:16.512 --> 16:19.450
Are you kidding? I love your story.

16:19.452 --> 16:22.460
Gets me fired up every time.

16:30.462 --> 16:32.500
This way, Mary.

16:36.482 --> 16:39.510
It'll take a minute to warm up.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.380
We express deepest
gratitude for this day,

17:29.382 --> 17:32.510
and every day, and that
we have found The Ladder.

17:32.512 --> 17:34.530
There...

17:34.532 --> 17:37.460
Ugh, you'd think it would get old.

17:37.462 --> 17:40.310
It doesn't.

17:40.312 --> 17:42.340
Why is Ashley Fields staring at you?

17:42.342 --> 17:44.360
She's probably plotting
to do something humiliating

17:44.362 --> 17:46.380
to one of us.

18:00.492 --> 18:03.490
- Watch your step.
- All right.

18:05.392 --> 18:07.390
One more.

18:11.522 --> 18:13.510
It's a nice day.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.380
Alison.

18:36.402 --> 18:38.510
Alison!

18:42.322 --> 18:44.380
Alison, we just want to talk.

18:44.382 --> 18:45.430
Come back, and just stop the car.

18:45.432 --> 18:48.500
We got to talk!

18:58.040 --> 19:01.070
Mary?

19:01.072 --> 19:05.000
Mary, I don't know how
much you know about us.

19:05.002 --> 19:08.100
Who we are. What we believe.

19:08.102 --> 19:12.030
I read one of your pamphlets.

19:12.032 --> 19:15.000
So, what, you just sign
up, and you're pain-free?

19:15.002 --> 19:19.020
No. I... I wish.

19:19.022 --> 19:21.120
Everyone has pain, Mary.

19:21.122 --> 19:24.000
We just try not to carry it with us.

19:26.030 --> 19:30.030
And how did you get into this?

19:30.032 --> 19:32.120
I was born into it.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.110
Was Cal born into it?

19:38.112 --> 19:42.090
No, but he came to us
as a very young boy.

19:45.950 --> 19:50.060
And now he's in charge?

19:50.062 --> 19:52.120
He's watching over us while our founder,

19:52.122 --> 19:55.940
The Guardian of The Light, is away.

19:55.942 --> 19:57.930
Dr. Steven Meyer.

19:57.932 --> 20:01.920
He's in Peru transcribing the
last three rungs of The Ladder...

20:01.922 --> 20:05.100
The instructions for our
spiritual development.

20:05.102 --> 20:08.940
He lives so deeply in Truth

20:08.942 --> 20:12.000
that Light literally surrounds him.

20:15.030 --> 20:22.000
I was you.

20:22.002 --> 20:25.090
I was lost, beaten,

20:25.092 --> 20:28.040
hopeless.

20:28.042 --> 20:30.040
I liked drugs.

20:30.042 --> 20:33.050
I liked girls.

20:33.052 --> 20:37.020
I loved my brother.

20:37.022 --> 20:41.020
You see, that was the
one thing that I did have.

20:41.022 --> 20:44.960
My brother, John.

20:44.962 --> 20:46.080
Johnny.

20:46.082 --> 20:49.040
He took care of me.

20:49.042 --> 20:51.110
He got us this little apartment.

20:51.112 --> 20:53.960
It was just a... you know,

20:53.962 --> 20:57.110
bathroom and a kitchen, but...

20:57.112 --> 20:59.040
it was ours.

20:59.042 --> 21:01.980
He made sure that I
finished high school.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.970
You know, I thought we
were, uh... we were happy.

21:16.080 --> 21:19.090
We, uh... we had each other.

21:25.070 --> 21:27.060
And one day I came home,

21:27.062 --> 21:29.980
and he was hanging

21:29.982 --> 21:33.150
in the kitchen from an extension cord.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.090
Um... I'm sorry.

21:53.092 --> 21:57.010
Uh...

22:03.952 --> 22:06.050
And then, um...

22:06.052 --> 22:09.020
Then, uh...

22:09.022 --> 22:10.930
I love this next part.

22:10.932 --> 22:16.010
You're running through
the streets, and, uh...

22:16.012 --> 22:18.040
you want to do yourself in, right?

22:18.042 --> 22:20.960
You want to jump off a bridge.

22:20.962 --> 22:22.000
Step in front of traffic.

22:22.002 --> 22:24.000
I want to die.

22:24.002 --> 22:25.930
I don't want to live anymore.

22:25.932 --> 22:27.960
So you go into some... Some store.

22:30.152 --> 22:32.980
And, uh...

22:32.982 --> 22:34.130
it's a bookstore.

22:37.942 --> 22:39.080
I sit down,

22:39.082 --> 22:43.920
and there's this book...

22:46.082 --> 22:48.960
And I start thumbing through it.

22:48.962 --> 22:52.060
And I'm reading and...

22:52.062 --> 22:57.120
it starts explaining my life to me.

22:57.122 --> 22:59.940
"The Ladder," folks.

22:59.942 --> 23:03.010
First book of Meyerism.

23:03.012 --> 23:06.950
Everything...

23:06.952 --> 23:11.930
from the suffering...

23:11.932 --> 23:14.120
to the emptiness.

23:17.022 --> 23:20.140
It got me.

23:20.142 --> 23:25.150
So, you run six miles across
town to our closest center,

23:25.152 --> 23:29.060
and... what did you find?

23:32.022 --> 23:34.040
Eddie?

23:39.052 --> 23:45.040
When you got there...

23:45.042 --> 23:50.150
when you came to us...

23:50.152 --> 23:53.020
what did you find?

24:01.002 --> 24:03.920
Home.

24:03.922 --> 24:06.130
<i>As the doctor walked up
the steep mountain...</i>

24:06.132 --> 24:08.030
I was home.

24:08.032 --> 24:10.010
<i>He thought about all
the horrible things</i>

24:10.012 --> 24:13.000
he had done to the
soldiers at the hospital.

24:15.040 --> 24:19.130
He now knew that it was all lies...

24:23.082 --> 24:26.990
What he had been asked
to do. What he had done.

24:26.992 --> 24:30.020
And he knew

24:30.022 --> 24:33.110
he couldn't live a life of lies anymore.

24:38.032 --> 24:39.990
What?

24:41.920 --> 24:43.150
Hope I'm not bothering you.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.050
No. Not at all.

24:56.100 --> 25:00.060
What's going on?

25:00.062 --> 25:01.930
Mary, right? Mary...

25:01.932 --> 25:03.920
Cox.

25:06.080 --> 25:08.070
We taking good care of you, Mary Cox?

25:08.072 --> 25:09.950
Mm-hmm.

25:13.130 --> 25:16.010
What can I do for you?

26:11.120 --> 26:13.950
You're very beautiful.

26:19.950 --> 26:21.150
Very.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.080
What are you doing?

26:30.082 --> 26:31.140
You don't have to do that.

26:31.142 --> 26:32.980
I can do it to you.

26:32.982 --> 26:36.070
I'm not doing anything, Mary.

26:38.070 --> 26:41.020
This isn't easy. Believe me.

26:46.060 --> 26:49.950
You don't want me?

26:51.010 --> 26:53.080
No, I definitely want you.

26:57.040 --> 27:00.000
I just, um...

27:04.940 --> 27:10.010
I just have this feeling that, uh...

27:10.012 --> 27:12.080
sex is...

27:12.082 --> 27:15.070
It's a very complicated thing for you.

27:22.982 --> 27:27.920
My dad started selling me
to his friends when I was 11.

27:29.140 --> 27:33.020
All my life I had this fantasy.

27:33.022 --> 27:38.130
One day, an angel would
float down from the sky...

27:38.132 --> 27:41.970
and save me.

27:51.110 --> 27:55.060
I think...

27:55.062 --> 27:59.980
that this was meant to be, Mary Cox.

28:03.032 --> 28:06.920
We were meant to find each other.

28:09.972 --> 28:15.120
Once you start to know The Ladder...

28:15.122 --> 28:18.020
all the pain,

28:18.022 --> 28:23.060
all the horrible things...

28:23.062 --> 28:28.150
that were done to you...

28:28.152 --> 28:31.000
they're gonna disappear.

28:36.012 --> 28:39.000
No, they won't.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.270
Hey, Eddie.

33:12.272 --> 33:15.250
Oh, hey.

33:15.252 --> 33:17.120
How you feeling?

33:25.122 --> 33:27.140
What is it?

33:30.130 --> 33:32.220
Eddie, what do you see?

33:32.222 --> 33:35.090
Ah!

33:35.092 --> 33:37.090
It's my brother.

33:37.092 --> 33:38.260
My brother.

33:38.262 --> 33:40.280
Okay.

33:40.282 --> 33:43.120
All right, all right. You're okay.

33:45.100 --> 33:48.070
Okay, let it out

33:52.300 --> 33:56.090
He sees his brother.

33:56.092 --> 34:00.150
Ask your brother what he wants.

34:06.180 --> 34:08.150
What do you want, Johnny?

35:08.202 --> 35:11.150
Where are we going?

35:32.120 --> 35:33.280
What?

35:33.282 --> 35:36.160
In there?

35:49.290 --> 35:51.100
Daddy, Daddy!

35:51.102 --> 35:54.220
Hey, kiddo! Oh, look at you.

35:54.222 --> 35:57.180
I'm away two weeks, and
you grew five inches.

35:57.182 --> 35:59.240
- She's a beanstalk.
- What's up with that?

35:59.242 --> 36:03.130
All right, we're gonna have
to plant you in the backyard.

36:03.132 --> 36:05.130
Hey.

36:05.132 --> 36:06.290
Was 6R awesome, Dad?

36:06.292 --> 36:08.190
What happened? Did you see things?

36:08.192 --> 36:10.200
Oh, man, I'll tell you
all about that later.

36:10.202 --> 36:13.130
- I missed you.
- Mmm.

36:13.132 --> 36:16.190
I missed you.

37:20.190 --> 37:22.230
You know what?

37:22.232 --> 37:25.260
I have to go finish up
some work, but I'll be...

37:27.210 --> 37:30.230
Oh, what is... What is that?

37:30.232 --> 37:32.260
A slip.

37:34.232 --> 37:36.110
Oh, my God.

37:36.112 --> 37:40.210
Oh, baby. I missed you.

37:40.212 --> 37:42.240
I love you.

38:23.200 --> 38:26.130
<i>Hello?</i>

38:26.132 --> 38:28.110
<i>No, you don't need to know my name.</i>

38:28.112 --> 38:30.160
How about you tell me something
so I know that this is real,

38:30.162 --> 38:33.110
and that this isn't a trap?

38:38.170 --> 38:40.170
Okay.

38:43.140 --> 38:45.220
I guess it's my turn.

38:48.190 --> 38:51.260
Listen, um...

38:51.262 --> 38:56.080
I think that I am having doubts.

39:16.180 --> 39:18.160
<i>The future is coming.</i>

39:18.162 --> 39:20.200
<i>Everything Steve predicted.</i>

39:20.202 --> 39:22.130
Global temperatures are rising,

39:22.132 --> 39:25.210
giving way to extreme weather events.

39:25.212 --> 39:27.130
The Arctic shelf is melting,

39:27.132 --> 39:31.130
and fire, floods, and
famine will ensue...

39:31.132 --> 39:32.210
Exacerbating poverty,

39:32.212 --> 39:34.280
political instability, terrorism.

39:34.282 --> 39:38.200
Everything we know will collapse,

39:38.202 --> 39:43.160
but those of us who ascend
The Ladder will be safe.

39:45.090 --> 39:46.250
As you all know,

39:46.252 --> 39:49.080
Doc is finishing transcribing
the last three rungs.

39:49.082 --> 39:51.290
He's told me there's stuff
in there that is gonna make

39:51.292 --> 39:56.160
our lives in the here
and now so much better...

39:59.160 --> 40:03.240
And our lives in The Garden...

40:03.242 --> 40:05.220
spectacular.

40:05.222 --> 40:08.220
I can't wait to be with
you all in The Garden.

40:09.272 --> 40:14.090
When will they be done?

40:14.092 --> 40:16.070
- Eddie?
- No, no, no. It's okay, Sarah.

40:16.072 --> 40:18.110
Um...

40:18.112 --> 40:20.120
Doc isn't here.

40:22.160 --> 40:25.080
I don't care if you're not 8R.
If you have questions, ask 'em.

40:25.082 --> 40:30.230
I was just wondering when Doc
might be done with the rungs.

40:30.232 --> 40:33.250
I mean, they're important.

40:33.252 --> 40:36.100
You know, we... we need them.

40:39.180 --> 40:42.130
It's not up to Doc.

40:42.132 --> 40:45.210
When the message is done,

40:45.212 --> 40:48.300
Steve is done.

40:56.072 --> 40:57.300
She was tired tonight.

40:57.302 --> 41:01.200
She was out like that.

41:01.202 --> 41:03.260
What happened on your retreat?

41:03.262 --> 41:05.140
What do you mean?

41:05.142 --> 41:08.080
You've been acting
distant since you got back.

41:12.102 --> 41:15.240
Yeah. Um...

41:15.242 --> 41:19.150
My "trip," you know,
it just didn't go so well.

41:21.210 --> 41:23.110
Medicine?

41:23.112 --> 41:25.220
Yeah, I think it just, you
know, affected me badly.

41:25.222 --> 41:27.170
I'm sorry if I've been
a little weird. It's just...

41:27.172 --> 41:30.210
- Who'd you call last night?
- What?

41:30.212 --> 41:32.070
I woke up. You weren't in bed.

41:32.072 --> 41:35.260
I went downstairs.
You were on the phone.

41:35.262 --> 41:37.230
Why didn't you say anything?

41:37.232 --> 41:41.070
Did you transgress, Eddie?

41:41.072 --> 41:44.250
What? Babe, hey, no, no, no.

41:44.252 --> 41:48.150
No. Look. I was talking to a Possible.

41:48.152 --> 41:53.110
Miranda Frank was on your retreat.

41:53.112 --> 41:55.250
Miranda Frank?

41:55.252 --> 41:57.110
Wait, what?

41:57.112 --> 41:58.260
How do you even know that?

41:58.262 --> 41:59.280
I looked it up.

41:59.282 --> 42:01.130
We're transparent, Eddie.

42:01.132 --> 42:04.150
We don't keep secrets.

42:04.152 --> 42:07.270
I am really struggling here.

42:07.272 --> 42:12.260
All right, I love you, and I chose you.

42:12.262 --> 42:16.080
- You chose me?
- I chose you.

42:16.082 --> 42:17.180
What do you mean, you chose me?

42:17.182 --> 42:19.140
Chose me over Cal? Is that what this is?

42:19.142 --> 42:21.090
No, no! That is not what I am saying.

42:21.092 --> 42:25.160
No?

42:25.162 --> 42:29.110
Look, I'm...

42:29.112 --> 42:32.210
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42:32.212 --> 42:34.260
All right?

42:34.262 --> 42:40.110
I know that I have been a little off...

42:42.100 --> 42:44.140
But you need to know

42:44.142 --> 42:47.200
that you are it.

42:47.202 --> 42:49.170
Look at me.

42:49.172 --> 42:54.210
You are everything to me, okay?

42:54.212 --> 42:58.200
You're it.

42:58.202 --> 43:00.180
I remember the day.

43:00.182 --> 43:03.250
I never imagined a future
for myself before you,

43:03.252 --> 43:08.090
but then there... there you were

43:08.092 --> 43:10.190
with that glass of water,

43:10.192 --> 43:16.120
and I didn't have to try
to imagine one anymore.

43:16.122 --> 43:18.130
I had it.

43:20.240 --> 43:24.200
Okay?

43:24.202 --> 43:27.250
If you've done something,
we'll get through it.

43:27.252 --> 43:29.210
- Oh, babe.
- We'll do the program.

43:29.212 --> 43:30.250
My parents did it.

43:30.252 --> 43:34.070
I'm not doing the program!

43:34.072 --> 43:38.300
Sarah, there is a kid
struggling over joining us, okay?

43:38.302 --> 43:40.240
He called me late last night.

43:40.242 --> 43:44.240
I was doing my job, okay?

43:44.242 --> 43:48.170
I was doing my job.

43:48.172 --> 43:51.090
I am intuiting something
else is going on.

43:51.092 --> 43:53.100
Well, your intuition is off!

44:14.140 --> 44:16.250
<i>I don't know what the
hell I'm doing here.</i>

44:16.252 --> 44:18.280
<i>You know, I was high as
a kite, so what I saw,</i>

44:18.282 --> 44:22.180
or what I think I saw,

44:22.182 --> 44:24.100
was it real?

44:24.102 --> 44:28.120
You know, I mean, was the
vision of my brother...

44:28.122 --> 44:31.130
even real?

44:31.132 --> 44:35.240
I mean, am I gonna blow up my life,

44:35.242 --> 44:38.300
a life that I love,

44:38.302 --> 44:42.150
because of something I don't even know

44:42.152 --> 44:44.290
if I really saw?

44:49.152 --> 44:51.250
I guess so.

44:51.252 --> 44:55.090
Otherwise you wouldn't be here.

44:59.160 --> 45:01.190
Sorry to wake you up.

45:01.192 --> 45:04.120
No, I was up.

45:18.120 --> 45:21.140
I was so scared of you

45:21.142 --> 45:22.250
when we were young.

45:22.252 --> 45:24.200
Before Eddie.

45:24.202 --> 45:28.160
You'd sneak into my bed.
Your hands were like fire.

45:30.090 --> 45:34.170
I thought, "This guy could
never really love a person.

45:34.172 --> 45:37.120
Not for the years. He needs too much."

45:40.200 --> 45:43.260
Then Eddie walked into my life.

45:43.262 --> 45:47.110
And I thought, "Eddie.

45:47.112 --> 45:49.110
Eddie can love a person."

45:58.130 --> 46:00.240
I was so wrong.

46:13.210 --> 46:17.240
He transgressed.

46:17.242 --> 46:22.180
I just followed him to
meet a woman at a motel.

46:50.250 --> 46:52.280
Mary? Mary?

46:55.280 --> 46:58.200
Let's make it better.

47:05.530 --> 47:08.640
Good morning!

47:08.642 --> 47:10.660
Oh, hey.

47:10.662 --> 47:12.570
No!

47:12.572 --> 47:14.490
Mommy, make him stop!

47:14.492 --> 47:15.620
All right, let's get up. Let's go.

47:15.622 --> 47:17.480
I don't want to be late for gathering.
Come on.

47:17.482 --> 47:18.540
Hey, did you brush your teeth?

47:18.542 --> 47:19.630
No. Should I?

47:19.632 --> 47:21.650
Yes. Go, go, go.

47:34.580 --> 47:36.460
Hey, uh...

47:38.492 --> 47:41.580
I'm sorry about our fight last night.

47:41.582 --> 47:44.460
I shouldn't have gotten so angry.

47:44.462 --> 47:45.680
I'm sorry too.

47:48.502 --> 47:53.510
<i>Hello, everybody.</i>

47:53.512 --> 47:56.650
<i>Welcome to our service.</i>

47:56.652 --> 47:59.530
It's beautiful to see
you all here today.

47:59.532 --> 48:01.510
This morning,

48:01.512 --> 48:03.520
I'm gonna tell you the story

48:03.522 --> 48:06.550
of Plato's Cave.

48:06.552 --> 48:09.530
Plato asks you to imagine this cave

48:09.532 --> 48:12.600
that people are born into,

48:12.602 --> 48:17.470
chained, so they can only
see in one direction...

48:17.472 --> 48:20.550
At the wall in front of them.

48:20.552 --> 48:23.620
Everybody got that?

48:23.622 --> 48:25.660
On this wall in front of them,

48:25.662 --> 48:30.510
they see figures, shapes.

48:30.512 --> 48:33.580
And they have names for
the things that they see.

48:33.582 --> 48:36.640
Their work,

48:36.642 --> 48:40.450
their jobs, their towns,

48:40.452 --> 48:41.680
their friends,

48:41.682 --> 48:44.640
their lovers,

48:44.642 --> 48:47.580
their gods.

48:47.582 --> 48:49.650
And of course the
prisoners believe everything

48:49.652 --> 48:53.520
they see is real, true.

48:53.522 --> 48:54.670
Why wouldn't they? It's
what they see every day.

48:54.672 --> 48:56.680
It's all they know.

48:56.682 --> 48:58.670
Now, Plato says,

48:58.672 --> 49:01.680
"Imagine one of these
prisoners is able to get free."

49:01.682 --> 49:04.470
He doesn't say how, but
this prisoner gets free,

49:04.472 --> 49:07.650
and for the first time,
he's able to see behind him,

49:07.652 --> 49:10.530
and he sees that there's a fire.

49:10.532 --> 49:13.610
And between the fire and the prisoners

49:13.612 --> 49:15.460
there is a bridge,

49:15.462 --> 49:19.530
and across the bridge, figures walk.

49:19.532 --> 49:23.550
And suddenly the free
man realizes that what he

49:23.552 --> 49:26.490
and his fellow prisoners
have been seeing all this time

49:26.492 --> 49:29.670
are the shadows of the real things

49:29.672 --> 49:31.640
that walk over the bridge.

49:31.642 --> 49:34.570
Oh!

49:34.572 --> 49:36.620
Shadows of reality.

49:39.630 --> 49:43.580
Now, the man understands that everything

49:43.582 --> 49:47.480
he thought was real, isn't.

49:49.620 --> 49:51.660
So now he wonders,

49:51.662 --> 49:54.680
"Well, what else don't I know?"

49:54.682 --> 49:56.570
And he scrapes

49:56.572 --> 49:58.640
and he crawls his way
up out of the cave,

49:58.642 --> 50:01.610
until finally he pulls himself
out panting, breathless.

50:01.612 --> 50:05.650
And that's when he sees the sky,

50:05.652 --> 50:09.680
the sun, the moon, the...

50:09.682 --> 50:12.530
the things that make the seasons.

50:12.532 --> 50:15.550
And the free man realizes

50:15.552 --> 50:19.510
that there is a real,

50:19.512 --> 50:23.560
true world out there

50:23.562 --> 50:26.670
that his fellow prisoners, his friends,

50:26.672 --> 50:29.600
they don't know.

50:29.602 --> 50:33.520
So now he's got to tell them.

50:33.522 --> 50:37.450
So he comes back ranting and raving.

50:37.452 --> 50:38.670
"What you think is real, isn't.

50:38.672 --> 50:41.480
"You're a prisoner.
Your life isn't real.

50:41.482 --> 50:43.610
"You're just looking at shadows."

50:43.612 --> 50:47.560
Then, Plato asks,

50:47.562 --> 50:50.610
"What would the prisoners do?"

50:50.612 --> 50:54.550
Would they, if they could,

50:54.552 --> 50:57.490
stone this man?

50:57.492 --> 50:59.580
Kill him

50:59.582 --> 51:02.650
rather than have their
reality destroyed?

51:06.470 --> 51:08.540
What would you do?

51:08.542 --> 51:13.680
Would you choose to
remain in your shackles?

51:13.682 --> 51:16.610
- No.
- Would you choose

51:16.612 --> 51:21.610
<i>to hold on to your pain
and your suffering?</i>

51:21.612 --> 51:23.500
<i>No.</i>

51:23.502 --> 51:26.640
<i>Or would you dare to break free?</i>

51:26.642 --> 51:28.620
<i>Break free.</i>

51:28.622 --> 51:33.620
<i>Would you dare to let me
unchain you and lead you up?</i>

51:33.622 --> 51:35.660
<i>- Yes!
- Up out of the cave?</i>

51:35.662 --> 51:39.650
<i>Yes!</i>

51:39.652 --> 51:41.550
Hi, Daddy.

51:44.472 --> 51:48.520
Where the fuck have you been?

51:48.522 --> 51:50.640
That's my dad.

52:00.610 --> 52:04.520
I want you to get on your knees,

52:04.522 --> 52:07.470
and I want you to beg your
daughter's forgiveness.

52:12.510 --> 52:13.550
You will beg.

52:13.552 --> 52:18.560
You will grovel at her feet

52:18.562 --> 52:22.470
for what you've done
to this innocent soul.

52:29.522 --> 52:31.520
Ugh!

52:31.522 --> 52:32.670
Oh!

53:00.540 --> 53:04.510
<i>Would you dare to let
me unchain you...</i>

53:04.512 --> 53:06.590
<i>- Yes!
- And lead you up, up?</i>

53:06.592 --> 53:07.650
<i>- Yes!
- Out of the cave?</i>

53:07.652 --> 53:09.600
Yes!

53:09.602 --> 53:13.520
Would you let me lead you up
out of the world of shadows?

53:13.522 --> 53:14.610
Yes!

53:14.612 --> 53:16.660
- Will you?
- Whoo!

53:21.672 --> 53:25.500
Will you let me lead you into The Light?

53:25.502 --> 53:27.640
Yes!

54:08.600 --> 54:10.550
You wanted to see me?

54:10.552 --> 54:12.590
Yeah.

54:16.590 --> 54:19.520
You know I love you
like a brother, Eddie.

54:19.522 --> 54:23.480
Yeah.

54:23.482 --> 54:28.520
So I'll get right to it.

54:28.522 --> 54:32.490
You having an affair, Eddie?

54:32.492 --> 54:34.660
No.

54:34.662 --> 54:36.670
No, Sarah just... look.

54:36.672 --> 54:38.570
This whole thing is just a big mix-up.

54:38.572 --> 54:40.620
Who'd you meet at the motel last night?

54:52.540 --> 54:55.470
So what did you see, anyway,

54:55.472 --> 54:58.470
when you opened the door?

55:20.510 --> 55:23.520
<i>There is no Light.</i>
