01:43.181 --> 01:46.548
It's going. It's going.

01:47.685 --> 01:49.915
And it's gone.

01:50.088 --> 01:51.282
Whatever.

01:52.690 --> 01:54.783
Maybe we should take a break.

01:55.427 --> 01:57.827
That's it. I can't take this anymore.

01:57.996 --> 01:59.520
I can't. I give up.

01:59.697 --> 02:01.961
I'm sick of struggling for survival.

02:02.133 --> 02:05.660
Competing with gophers and
earthworms and that loser sparrow...

02:05.837 --> 02:07.702
...who always takes my nuts.

02:07.872 --> 02:09.931
And I'm especially sick of this stupid...

02:10.108 --> 02:12.838
...stupid tree.

02:14.512 --> 02:16.480
- What's happening?
- Guys.

02:16.648 --> 02:19.310
I think he made it angry.

03:22.514 --> 03:24.345
I'm awake.

03:25.416 --> 03:27.043
I'm up...

03:27.218 --> 03:28.879
...and I'm late.

03:32.090 --> 03:36.390
Demo. Dave Seville.

03:46.771 --> 03:50.070
Keys. Bag.

03:51.209 --> 03:52.403
Pants.

03:52.577 --> 03:54.545
I need pants. Pants are essential.

04:01.119 --> 04:02.586
Claire.

04:02.820 --> 04:04.947
- Dave.
- Hey.

04:05.123 --> 04:06.988
How's it going?

04:07.425 --> 04:10.121
I haven't seen you since...

04:10.295 --> 04:12.991
Well, since you said you never wanted
to see me again.

04:13.198 --> 04:14.324
So I guess it worked.

04:14.499 --> 04:15.898
What a fun day that was.

04:16.067 --> 04:18.934
Let me guess.
You're late for something again.

04:19.103 --> 04:21.731
- Same old Dave.
- Not following you.

04:21.906 --> 04:24.898
You know,
the guy who's always fooling around...

04:25.076 --> 04:27.510
...who can't handle
a serious relationship.

04:27.712 --> 04:28.736
That was the old Dave.

04:28.913 --> 04:31.347
How about we get together,
talk about the new Dave?

04:31.816 --> 04:33.408
Tomorrow night. My place.

04:33.785 --> 04:35.446
- I...
- Great.

04:35.620 --> 04:38.783
- No...
- You look good, Claire.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.307
Where are we?

05:30.475 --> 05:35.412
Well, I think they remodeled our forest.
I like it. Stylish, yet functional.

05:36.147 --> 05:37.478
Where did the mountains go?

05:37.649 --> 05:41.278
Give me a break.
We're in a building, Theodore.

05:43.288 --> 05:45.984
Dave.

05:47.091 --> 05:50.151
- Ian.
- Hey, big guy.

05:50.928 --> 05:53.260
Hey, you ever seen the view
from the 80th floor?

05:53.431 --> 05:57.367
- No. They never let me past the lobby.
- What? I can't...

05:57.535 --> 06:00.368
Hey, back off, man,
this is Dave Seville.

06:04.942 --> 06:08.673
Mr. Seville, can I offer you
some muffins, scones, pastries?

06:08.846 --> 06:10.677
No. I'd hate to be a bother.

06:10.848 --> 06:12.907
It's no problem.
We have an omelet station.

06:13.084 --> 06:14.517
Omelet station.

06:14.686 --> 06:16.950
Can I get you some water
or a soy latte?

06:17.121 --> 06:19.351
How about a shot
of wheatgrass juice?

06:19.524 --> 06:21.754
Maybe later. Thanks.

06:51.789 --> 06:53.950
Let's talk about your song, Dave.

06:54.125 --> 06:55.888
Well, as crazy as it sounds...

06:56.060 --> 06:59.120
...the original inspiration came to me...
- The song sucks, Dave.

06:59.797 --> 07:03.858
- What?
- Your song? It's awful. I hate it.

07:04.369 --> 07:10.274
You know, I mean, who's gonna sing it?
Justin, Fergie? Not a chance.

07:10.441 --> 07:12.602
I need something new.
I need something fresh.

07:12.777 --> 07:15.075
- That is new.
- The next big thing.

07:15.246 --> 07:18.738
Dave, we go way back, all right?

07:18.916 --> 07:22.477
And we've both come a long way
since college. You? Not so much.

07:22.954 --> 07:28.392
I wanted to like that song,
but you heard it. Not that good.

07:28.893 --> 07:31.088
If I wasn't your friend,
I'd say:

07:31.262 --> 07:34.959
"Dave, you go right back
out of this office...

07:35.133 --> 07:37.931
...and you keep writing music.
You'll get there someday."

07:38.102 --> 07:40.434
But I am your friend,
so I'm going to tell you...

07:40.605 --> 07:42.835
...that there is no sense
in writing songs...

07:43.007 --> 07:48.206
...that no one is ever,
ever going to sing.

07:49.180 --> 07:50.909
Ever?

08:03.728 --> 08:05.025
Excuse me.

08:06.497 --> 08:08.658
Can I get some of that water?

08:08.833 --> 08:10.733
We ran out.

08:40.198 --> 08:41.563
Hey!

08:48.973 --> 08:50.440
- Out of the way.
- Alvin...

08:50.608 --> 08:52.576
...slow down.
- Move your butt, Theodore.

08:52.743 --> 08:55.234
You stepped on my tail.

08:58.516 --> 09:00.416
Last one to the door is roadkill.

09:00.585 --> 09:02.018
I'm in.

09:02.186 --> 09:03.619
What are these shiny things?

09:03.788 --> 09:06.552
Theodore, we're leaving now.

09:12.430 --> 09:15.456
Okay, this wasn't my best idea.
Look out!

09:15.633 --> 09:17.066
Maniac!

09:19.003 --> 09:21.198
Back to tree. Back to tree.

09:21.372 --> 09:23.203
Back to the dog. Back to the dog!

09:23.374 --> 09:25.808
- Basket! Three o'clock.
- Which way is 3 o'clock?

09:26.010 --> 09:28.877
- This way.
- Guys, wait for me.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.412
Wait up.
I still have baby fat, you know.

09:31.582 --> 09:34.073
- Jump. You've gotta really want it.
- I want it.

09:34.252 --> 09:36.413
- I want it.
- I can't hang like this all day.

09:37.054 --> 09:39.614
Will you jump already?

09:40.324 --> 09:42.383
Muffins.

10:07.685 --> 10:09.846
Gross. Is this his house?

10:10.054 --> 10:13.319
No. It's his garbage can.

10:55.733 --> 10:58.998
This must be where he stores
his food for winter.

10:59.737 --> 11:01.705
<i>As it came down to one...</i>

11:01.872 --> 11:04.636
<i>Boa has the mouse trapped on a branch
with no way out.</i>

11:04.809 --> 11:07.073
<i>As the boa moves in for the attack...</i>

11:07.244 --> 11:10.338
<i>... the mouse
seems to be facing certain death.</i>

11:15.553 --> 11:18.488
<i>The boa's sensitive tongue
tastes the victim's presence.</i>

11:18.656 --> 11:21.056
<i>The mouse crashes
through the foliage.</i>

11:21.225 --> 11:23.750
Come on, baby. Come to papa!

11:24.428 --> 11:26.658
Hello, gorgeous.

11:28.432 --> 11:30.024
We've hit the mother lode.

11:30.201 --> 11:33.261
<i>- Tropical rainforest
where food is bountiful.</i>

11:36.007 --> 11:39.738
This is the greatest day of my life.

11:39.910 --> 11:42.674
Eureka! I found the cheese balls.

11:43.848 --> 11:46.112
Alvin, what are you doing?
Don't make a mess.

11:46.283 --> 11:48.751
Cannonball.

11:51.922 --> 11:53.219
Quick. Hide.

11:53.391 --> 11:55.359
Hurry, you guys.

12:10.041 --> 12:12.441
Did I put these here?

14:02.219 --> 14:04.187
There you are. I got you.

14:14.865 --> 14:17.060
He's been out for quite a while.

14:17.301 --> 14:18.563
You guys, he's dead.

14:18.736 --> 14:21.432
Don't panic. Wipe everything down.

14:21.605 --> 14:24.369
I need three garbage bags, a shovel,
some disinfectant...

14:24.542 --> 14:26.601
...some latex gloves and oregano, go!

14:26.811 --> 14:29.006
Hang on, Sherlock. He's coming to.

14:29.180 --> 14:31.876
I must be hearing things.

14:35.820 --> 14:37.344
Oh, this is trippy.

14:37.521 --> 14:39.716
Sir, are you all right?

14:42.326 --> 14:44.021
Get back!

14:44.195 --> 14:45.526
Squirrels can't talk.

14:45.696 --> 14:47.357
Hey.

14:47.898 --> 14:49.195
Watch it, genius.

14:49.366 --> 14:51.891
We are chipmunks. Chipmunks.

14:52.069 --> 14:54.401
Chipmunks can't talk either.

14:54.572 --> 14:56.267
Our lips are moving
and words are coming out.

14:56.841 --> 14:58.365
This is not happening.

14:58.542 --> 15:02.069
I am not talking to chipmunks.
I am not talking to chipmunks.

15:02.246 --> 15:04.441
So how's that working for you, Dave?

15:05.482 --> 15:06.710
How do you know my name?

15:06.884 --> 15:09.978
I'll field that one.
We read your mail. By accident.

15:10.154 --> 15:12.486
You really ought to pay
that utility bill, Dave.

15:12.656 --> 15:15.557
- You ever heard of a credit rating?
- What's this thing?

15:15.726 --> 15:18.593
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Stop doing... Turn that off.

15:18.762 --> 15:20.389
Sorry.

15:20.564 --> 15:22.657
He fell out of the tree at birth.

15:22.867 --> 15:24.960
Can all animals talk?

15:25.135 --> 15:28.502
Well, I believe fish
have this type of sign language.

15:28.672 --> 15:31.835
Hey, Dave, do all humans have houses
that smell like sweat socks?

15:32.009 --> 15:33.499
<i>Dave likes to wear</i>

15:33.677 --> 15:36.441
<i>Dirty underwear with little hairs</i>

15:36.614 --> 15:38.411
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

15:39.316 --> 15:41.648
Allow us to introduce ourselves.

15:41.819 --> 15:44.151
Hello, I'm Simon, the smart one.

15:44.321 --> 15:46.653
- He's Alvin.
- The awesomest one.

15:46.824 --> 15:48.655
And I'm Theodore.

15:48.826 --> 15:51.454
Oh, nice to meet you.
Now get out of my house.

15:51.629 --> 15:54.154
But we talk.

15:54.665 --> 15:57.463
Which makes me want you
out of my house that much more.

15:57.635 --> 16:00.968
It's creepy. Unnatural. Somewhat evil.

16:01.138 --> 16:03.606
I kind of liked him better
when he was unconscious.

16:03.774 --> 16:06.174
- Gotcha.
- Hey.

16:13.851 --> 16:15.318
Don't do this, Dave.

16:15.486 --> 16:18.148
We can gnaw right through this door.

16:24.795 --> 16:26.422
Hi.

17:08.771 --> 17:10.830
Oh, were we disturbing you?

17:11.241 --> 17:13.709
What, you guys can sing too?

17:13.877 --> 17:17.074
That's not singing. This is singing.

17:44.141 --> 17:46.234
This is amazing.

17:47.878 --> 17:49.368
Here, everyone inside.

17:54.618 --> 17:56.609
- There you go.
- Thank you.

17:59.323 --> 18:01.154
All right, here's the deal.

18:01.325 --> 18:04.920
You guys sing my songs,
you get to sleep here.

18:08.098 --> 18:11.090
No. Wait. Is breakfast included?

18:13.103 --> 18:14.161
I can live with that.

18:14.338 --> 18:16.431
What about TV privileges?

18:17.274 --> 18:18.764
Okay, but not after 7.

18:18.942 --> 18:19.966
- Eight.
- Done.

18:20.244 --> 18:23.577
But don't tell your animal friends,
because I don't wanna come home...

18:23.747 --> 18:25.840
...and find rabbits
and skunks on my couch.

18:26.050 --> 18:28.484
Filthy creatures, Dave.
Never associate with them.

18:28.652 --> 18:30.449
Yeah, you're our only friend.

18:30.621 --> 18:33.647
No, no, no.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.

18:33.824 --> 18:37.282
Let's just start with me
being your songwriter.

18:38.262 --> 18:41.425
Let me ask you.
Have you ever written a song before?

18:41.598 --> 18:45.329
- Yup.
- And is that your music stuff outside?

18:45.502 --> 18:47.094
Yup.

18:48.639 --> 18:49.970
Oh, no!

18:50.140 --> 18:51.300
Hurry back.

19:14.798 --> 19:21.499
So, fellas, all we gotta do
is find the right song, rehearse...

19:25.476 --> 19:26.670
- Hey, Dave.
- Simon.

19:27.845 --> 19:28.903
My bad.

19:29.113 --> 19:31.673
This is my sheet music.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.308
Alvin.

19:36.720 --> 19:39.848
This is not a Hula-Hoop.
It's a towel rack.

19:41.024 --> 19:44.221
- Killjoy.
- Are you guys always like this?

19:44.394 --> 19:46.021
We're kids, Dave.

19:46.196 --> 19:47.663
Well, where are your parents?

19:47.831 --> 19:50.994
When you're a chipmunk, your parents
take care of you for a week.

19:51.168 --> 19:52.692
Then they take off.

19:52.870 --> 19:55.862
Our parents were hippies.
They left early to join a commune.

19:56.039 --> 20:00.499
<i>- I am Robert the Robot.
- Help! Crazy robot. Help! It's after me!</i>

20:00.677 --> 20:03.077
- It's after me.
- Hey. Hey. Be careful with that.

20:04.081 --> 20:06.914
- Sorry.
- It's a collectible.

20:07.084 --> 20:11.646
- I got it for Christmas last year.
- Christmas! We love Christmas.

20:12.756 --> 20:15.054
Even though we've never
actually celebrated it.

20:15.225 --> 20:17.090
But we want to.

20:17.261 --> 20:19.855
Yeah, you can never go wrong
with Christmas.

20:20.030 --> 20:22.430
Oh, maybe we can celebrate it
with you.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.528
Yeah, maybe.

20:24.701 --> 20:29.400
Look, I've had a long and weird day,
so off to bed.

20:29.573 --> 20:31.165
Come on.

20:31.675 --> 20:33.302
We start work tomorrow.

20:33.477 --> 20:36.378
I want you bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed by 8.

20:36.547 --> 20:38.879
My tail isn't bushy till 9.

20:39.416 --> 20:41.680
Not my problem. Now go to sleep.

20:47.090 --> 20:48.751
I hope Christmas comes fast.

20:49.326 --> 20:51.556
Me too.

21:29.166 --> 21:35.105
<i>Want a plane that loops the loop?</i>

21:36.340 --> 21:37.807
Loop.

21:38.175 --> 21:39.665
Hoop.

21:40.377 --> 21:42.106
Hula-Hoop.

22:40.871 --> 22:44.102
Here's trouble. Fire in the hole!

22:44.308 --> 22:45.775
What are you guys doing?

22:45.942 --> 22:47.876
Nothing. What are you doing?

22:48.045 --> 22:50.673
Stand back, Dave. She's gonna blow!

22:53.050 --> 22:57.009
I got it. I got it, guys. Come to papa.

22:57.187 --> 23:02.250
- Hey. Where did it go?
- Simon, this landed right in front of you.

23:02.426 --> 23:04.121
You didn't see it?

23:04.695 --> 23:06.526
How many fingers am I holding up?

23:06.697 --> 23:10.224
Four. No, no, no.
Eight? Counting your thumb?

23:11.234 --> 23:13.259
- Wait, wait, wait...
- Hang on a second.

23:13.437 --> 23:14.904
Six. Final answer is six.

23:20.243 --> 23:21.733
Try these.

23:22.112 --> 23:23.875
How's that?

23:24.648 --> 23:26.115
Someone trashed your house.

23:26.750 --> 23:28.775
It was clean
when I went to bed last night.

23:28.952 --> 23:33.252
Well, we colored for a while,
but then we got hungry.

23:33.423 --> 23:34.822
Wanna see what we colored?

23:34.991 --> 23:36.754
Actually, I wanna play you
something.

23:36.927 --> 23:39.794
I wrote a song
for you guys to sing, so let's...

23:47.437 --> 23:50.270
We've put a few toaster waffles
aside for winter.

23:50.440 --> 23:51.998
And we're not sharing.

23:53.577 --> 23:57.638
Guys, we're gonna have food all winter,
so if you start storing it...

23:57.814 --> 24:00.783
...it's gonna get gross
and we're gonna have rodent...

24:03.387 --> 24:08.381
Bad, you know,
non-talking rodents around here.

24:08.992 --> 24:11.927
Let's go. Let's get to work.

24:21.004 --> 24:23.472
All right, you chipmunks.
Ready to sing your song?

24:23.640 --> 24:26.200
- I'll say we are.
- Yeah. Let's sing it now.

24:26.410 --> 24:28.207
- Ready, Simon?
- Okay.

24:28.412 --> 24:30.676
- Ready, Theodore?
- Okay.

24:30.847 --> 24:32.712
Alvin?

24:33.116 --> 24:34.344
Alvin?

24:34.518 --> 24:36.179
This kicks a hamster wheel's butt.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.181
Alvin!

24:40.056 --> 24:41.148
Okay!

24:41.324 --> 24:45.658
<i>Christmas, Christmastime is near</i>

24:45.829 --> 24:50.823
<i>Time for toys and time for cheer</i>

24:51.001 --> 24:55.495
<i>We've been good, but we can't last</i>

24:55.672 --> 25:00.336
<i>Hurry, Christmas, hurry fast</i>

25:00.510 --> 25:05.573
<i>Want a plane that loops the loop</i>

25:05.749 --> 25:09.981
<i>Me, I want a Hula-Hoop</i>

25:10.153 --> 25:14.749
<i>We can't hardly stand the wait</i>

25:14.958 --> 25:18.894
<i>Please, Christmas, don't be late</i>

25:23.066 --> 25:24.658
What?

25:24.835 --> 25:26.200
<i>Dave Seville's in the lobby.</i>

25:26.369 --> 25:29.202
<i>He says he won't leave
without seeing you.</i>

25:31.241 --> 25:33.573
That loser again?

25:40.851 --> 25:43.786
- Dave.
- Ian.

25:44.888 --> 25:47.049
- Okay.
- I've got something for you.

25:47.224 --> 25:48.885
- It's your next big thing.
- Dave.

25:49.059 --> 25:50.856
Don't say anything.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.554
What the...?

25:57.434 --> 25:59.629
Dave, don't do this to yourself, man.

25:59.803 --> 26:01.293
They sing.

26:06.376 --> 26:08.310
No. They don't.

26:08.512 --> 26:11.072
They do. Just give me a second.

26:11.248 --> 26:13.239
Come on, guys.

26:13.717 --> 26:17.915
<i>Want a plane that loops the loop</i>

26:18.088 --> 26:22.718
<i>Me, I want a Hula-Hoop</i>

26:24.027 --> 26:25.085
You know, Dave...

26:25.262 --> 26:27.287
...some people might say
it's kind of weird...

26:27.464 --> 26:29.762
...that a grown man
would want a Hula-Hoop.

26:29.933 --> 26:32.959
And others would say,
"You know what's weirder than that?

26:33.136 --> 26:35.468
A grown man bringing
another grown man...

26:35.639 --> 26:37.937
...a big box
with a bunch of chipmunks in it...

26:38.108 --> 26:40.303
...who not only speak English
but can sing."

26:40.477 --> 26:42.911
They do sing.
We've been practicing all morning.

26:43.079 --> 26:46.913
Oh, you've been practicing.
I never realized. Okay, well.

26:52.422 --> 26:56.586
Yeah. Okay, no.
Dave, I'm going to pretend...

26:56.760 --> 26:59.354
...that I have a lunch to go to.

26:59.563 --> 27:01.827
I've got a lunch to go to.

27:01.998 --> 27:03.090
What was that?

27:03.266 --> 27:05.996
Nothing. Nothing.
Just a little stage fright.

27:06.169 --> 27:07.932
I thought my heart
was gonna explode.

27:08.104 --> 27:09.662
We're not performing monkeys.

27:09.839 --> 27:11.704
Why do we have to sing
for that guy?

27:11.875 --> 27:12.967
Well, how's this?

27:13.143 --> 27:15.304
Pretend I need the money
and I hate my job...

27:15.478 --> 27:18.140
...and you're staying at my place,
so you owe me.

27:18.315 --> 27:19.373
We're sorry, Dave.

27:19.583 --> 27:21.608
Yeah, that helps.

27:23.019 --> 27:25.453
Never mind. I'm late for work.

27:25.622 --> 27:26.884
Can we go with you?

27:27.490 --> 27:29.685
What, so you can mess that up too?

27:29.859 --> 27:31.884
You're going home.

27:34.831 --> 27:36.662
Can I stand in your lap and steer?

27:36.833 --> 27:40.325
Oh, can we at least beep the horn?

27:40.503 --> 27:41.595
Never mind.

27:44.708 --> 27:47.541
So sorry about the delay.
It should be a couple more minutes.

27:48.211 --> 27:50.543
But we're building the suspense.

27:51.247 --> 27:54.808
- Here he is.
- Sorry I'm late.

28:01.157 --> 28:05.651
Boy, am I jazzed about our
Yum-able Energy Bars commercial.

28:05.829 --> 28:08.821
That's Good-able Energy Bar
commercial.

28:09.399 --> 28:11.026
Right, Good-able.

28:11.201 --> 28:13.533
Okay, here's the pitch.

28:13.703 --> 28:16.763
We open on a group of lethargic kids.

28:16.940 --> 28:20.034
Close-up on a little girl's face.
She's sad.

28:20.210 --> 28:23.236
Our customers don't like to think
of their kids as being sad.

28:23.413 --> 28:25.074
Could she be flying a kite?

28:25.248 --> 28:26.647
I like kites.

28:26.950 --> 28:28.281
Good.

28:28.785 --> 28:31.117
Okay, great. She's flying a kite.

28:31.287 --> 28:34.688
She's running with a kite.
She's running out of steam.

28:35.225 --> 28:38.126
She's tired and lets go of the kite.

28:38.294 --> 28:41.752
Oh, no. We see her face, it's sad.

28:41.931 --> 28:44.399
- But not too sad.
- Right.

28:44.567 --> 28:48.697
So she pulls out
her Good-able Energy Bar...

28:53.276 --> 28:54.903
It's my mom. Sorry.

28:55.979 --> 28:58.539
<i>- Hi, Mom.
- A little situation, Dave.</i>

28:58.715 --> 29:00.740
Theodore vacuumed up Alvin.

29:00.917 --> 29:03.317
- Alvin.
- Dave, help!

29:03.486 --> 29:06.922
<i>- What?
- At least it wasn't the garbage disposal.</i>

29:07.090 --> 29:08.250
Just stay calm.

29:09.259 --> 29:10.954
And there goes Theodore.

29:11.127 --> 29:13.220
Look, I can't do this right now, okay?

29:13.396 --> 29:16.229
I absolutely understand but...
Sorry, Dave?

29:16.399 --> 29:17.764
Quick question.

29:19.302 --> 29:22.100
How do you feel about an indoor pool?

29:22.272 --> 29:24.433
Look, if you flood my house,
you're dead.

29:24.607 --> 29:25.972
Out on the street, capiche?

29:28.445 --> 29:29.810
Mothers.

29:32.849 --> 29:36.649
Why don't we come over here
and look at the sales projections?

29:37.754 --> 29:41.986
You know, when I first saw these
numbers, I thought there's just no way...

29:42.158 --> 29:44.285
...but then I looked again.

29:49.165 --> 29:51.963
The "size of Theodore's butt"?

29:52.135 --> 29:54.933
Why don't we come back to that?

29:55.105 --> 29:58.666
Anyway, 10 years ago, the market share
for healthy food snacks...

29:58.842 --> 30:02.107
...was imperceptible
among 6- to 12-year-olds.

30:02.278 --> 30:03.768
"How smart Simon thinks he is"?

30:05.448 --> 30:07.643
Yeah, as opposed to
how smart he actually is.

30:07.817 --> 30:09.011
Who's Simon?

30:09.953 --> 30:12.183
- I didn't...
- Just move it along.

30:19.362 --> 30:23.560
You know what?
I think I'll just clean out my office.

30:23.767 --> 30:25.735
Sounds good.

30:25.902 --> 30:27.995
<i>SpongeBob. You're 15 minutes late.</i>

30:28.171 --> 30:33.575
<i>Sorry, Mr. Krabs,
I was out all night looking for Gary.</i>

30:33.777 --> 30:35.677
<i>He got away. Well...</i>

30:35.845 --> 30:38.313
Guys. What's this about?

30:38.481 --> 30:41.177
Obviously, Theodore's butt.

30:41.351 --> 30:42.841
We told you we colored.

30:43.019 --> 30:47.012
On my presentation boards?
You got me fired.

30:47.857 --> 30:49.484
We didn't know.

30:50.360 --> 30:53.921
- We're sorry, Dave.
- Oh, you're sorry? That's fantastic.

30:54.097 --> 30:58.227
Sorry doesn't get my job back, now,
does it, Theodore?

30:58.835 --> 31:01.201
Why are my clothes all over the place?

31:01.371 --> 31:03.896
We used them to mop up the water.
Good idea, right?

31:04.874 --> 31:06.671
Oh, my God. Theodore, did you just...?

31:08.211 --> 31:09.838
It's a raisin, Dave.

31:10.446 --> 31:11.538
Prove it.

31:16.352 --> 31:17.410
Okay, you got me.

31:17.587 --> 31:19.748
I wanna talk to all you guys.
Where's Alvin?

31:20.857 --> 31:23.519
- Alvin?
- You owe me bigtime.

31:23.693 --> 31:25.558
Alvin.

31:26.563 --> 31:27.621
Come on. Come on.

31:36.539 --> 31:39.201
There's this new thing.
It's called knocking.

31:39.375 --> 31:42.208
- Get out.
- I'm waiting for the rinse cycle.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.778
- Out.
- I'm taking a shower here.

31:44.948 --> 31:47.542
You know,
if I made a list of my worst days ever...

31:47.717 --> 31:49.947
...today would be at the top
of the list.

31:50.119 --> 31:52.144
And it's still early.

31:52.355 --> 31:53.379
Clam it, sudsy.

31:56.492 --> 31:59.723
Okay. Guys, let me just put it
to you like this, okay?

31:59.896 --> 32:05.493
I have no job, no career, my house
is always a mess. Thank you very much.

32:05.902 --> 32:10.669
<i>Hi, Dave. It's Claire Wilson calling.
And why did I just say my last name?</i>

32:10.874 --> 32:16.335
<i>That was weird. I guess I'm just a little
nervous about coming over for dinner.</i>

32:16.512 --> 32:18.673
<i>- Dinner.
- So, yeah. I'm gonna hang up now.</i>

32:18.882 --> 32:22.443
<i>I'll be there at 7. Okay. Bye.</i>

32:22.619 --> 32:24.018
That's half an hour.

32:27.090 --> 32:28.182
Who's Claire?

32:28.391 --> 32:30.825
Claire is Dave's mate.

32:30.994 --> 32:32.985
She is not my mate.

32:33.162 --> 32:34.891
She's my ex-mate.

32:36.299 --> 32:39.291
Okay. This is great.

32:39.469 --> 32:41.300
Dave. Dave, relax.

32:41.471 --> 32:44.167
You just go get the food.
We'll take care of the rest.

32:44.340 --> 32:46.205
Why am I having a hard time
believing you?

32:46.409 --> 32:49.276
That hurts, Dave. That really hurts.

32:49.445 --> 32:52.278
- Yeah. We're all in this together, Dave.
- Like a family.

32:53.116 --> 32:54.811
No. Not like a family.

32:54.984 --> 32:57.043
Tick-tock, Dave. Better bust a move.

32:57.453 --> 32:58.920
Right.

33:17.807 --> 33:20.708
We also do offices
and recreational vehicles.

33:21.978 --> 33:23.411
What's that smell?

33:23.579 --> 33:26.446
It's your cologne.

33:27.016 --> 33:29.678
What did you do?
Dump the entire bottle on the rug?

33:29.852 --> 33:32.514
We call it scenting the area.

33:32.689 --> 33:34.850
I gotta admit I'm surprised.

33:35.024 --> 33:36.082
The place looks great.

33:36.259 --> 33:39.490
Well, Dave, we chipmunks
are notoriously tidy.

33:39.662 --> 33:41.061
Yeah, I see that.

33:42.165 --> 33:44.156
- Those bread sticks smell great.
- Yeah.

33:44.567 --> 33:46.501
So when's dinner?

33:46.669 --> 33:49.900
Guys, I don't know
how to tell you this...

33:50.073 --> 33:52.041
...but it's just gonna be Claire and me.

33:52.208 --> 33:53.368
Hold the phone, Dave.

33:53.543 --> 33:54.567
- We can't have...
- No.

33:54.744 --> 33:55.768
- Even if we...
- No.

33:55.979 --> 33:58.539
- We thought it...
- And no. Look, in the other room.

33:58.715 --> 34:00.683
Jeez.

34:00.883 --> 34:03.351
What a buzzkill, man.

34:05.288 --> 34:08.882
- I never knew you could cook this well.
- It's all about slow roasting.

34:09.292 --> 34:14.092
It takes longer.
But when it comes to flavor, why rush?

34:14.263 --> 34:15.696
Well, I'm impressed.

34:19.002 --> 34:22.062
- I've been seeing your photos.
- Yeah, it's going really great.

34:22.237 --> 34:24.297
How about you, how's your job?

34:26.708 --> 34:29.268
Great. Loving it.

34:33.549 --> 34:34.982
How do you think it's going?

34:35.150 --> 34:37.483
Terrible. They're not even sniffing
each other.

34:37.652 --> 34:39.143
Alvin. Dave said that...

34:39.322 --> 34:42.917
Dave needs a little help
from the love doctor.

34:43.092 --> 34:44.320
And his assistant.

34:44.527 --> 34:46.255
Get back here.

34:47.063 --> 34:48.428
You know, this is nice.

34:48.598 --> 34:51.795
Just two friends having dinner.
Hanging out.

34:51.967 --> 34:54.937
No pressure. Nothing weird.

35:01.944 --> 35:06.506
My stereo does that all the time.
It's like it has a mind of its own.

35:06.682 --> 35:08.047
You were saying?

35:08.451 --> 35:12.581
Oh, nothing. I was just a little nervous
about coming over here.

35:12.755 --> 35:15.588
I wasn't sure if you thought
this was a date or something.

35:15.992 --> 35:18.153
A date? No.

35:25.768 --> 35:28.168
The wiring in my unit is shot.

35:29.138 --> 35:31.333
You should get an electrician
to fix that.

35:31.507 --> 35:34.670
I don't need anyone
to fix anything for me.

35:38.815 --> 35:40.942
Okay.

35:45.121 --> 35:48.887
Could you excuse me for a moment?
I'm gonna go check the fuse box.

35:57.033 --> 35:58.625
Hey.

35:59.368 --> 36:01.996
Look, I know what you guys
are up to. Alvin.

36:02.171 --> 36:04.298
- Breath check.
- Where's Al...?

36:06.909 --> 36:08.501
Dave, are you okay?

36:08.678 --> 36:10.009
Everything's fine.

36:11.180 --> 36:12.477
Why did you do that?

36:12.648 --> 36:16.243
I was just trying to help, Dave.
You have garlic breath.

36:17.019 --> 36:19.715
Well, stop helping.
You're ruining everything.

36:23.226 --> 36:24.887
I think I got something in my eye.

36:25.061 --> 36:27.393
Here. Let me see.

36:27.563 --> 36:33.900
Yeah. It looks really irritated.
It's so red. What happened?

36:34.070 --> 36:35.901
What was that?

36:36.072 --> 36:37.369
Oh, I thought I saw a rat.

36:37.540 --> 36:38.837
- A rat?
- Probably nothing.

36:39.008 --> 36:41.033
Here, let's finish eating, huh?

36:42.745 --> 36:45.009
Tomorrow, I'm gonna call
the exterminator.

36:48.784 --> 36:50.718
- What?
- Claire.

36:50.887 --> 36:52.286
Dave? Dave?

36:52.455 --> 36:55.515
- Tell her she completes you.
- What are you doing?

36:55.691 --> 36:57.556
- You got it, Dave.
- Dave.

36:57.727 --> 36:58.751
Dave, let go.

37:00.930 --> 37:02.955
I'm sorry, Claire. It's just...

37:04.567 --> 37:07.195
I lost my job, Claire.

37:07.370 --> 37:08.894
And I guess I just needed a hug.

37:09.071 --> 37:12.234
Well, why didn't you just say so?
Tell me what happened.

37:12.408 --> 37:15.605
Well, this is gonna sound
really strange.

37:16.445 --> 37:18.709
No games. No fooling around.

37:19.549 --> 37:22.416
- The truth?
- Please, I'm begging you.

37:26.889 --> 37:29.824
My life is being sabotaged
by talking chipmunks.

37:36.699 --> 37:39.065
- You know what?
- I'm not crazy, I swear.

37:39.235 --> 37:40.964
You haven't changed at all.

37:43.739 --> 37:48.836
Wait. Claire. Don't go. I can explain.

37:52.348 --> 37:54.316
Chipmunks.

37:57.453 --> 37:59.148
You should've kissed her, Dave.

37:59.322 --> 38:00.414
She wanted you.

38:00.590 --> 38:02.114
Alvin, you're not helping.

38:02.291 --> 38:03.451
Don't give up, Dave.

38:03.626 --> 38:05.093
Go away. Leave me alone.

38:05.261 --> 38:07.456
Dave, would you like a cookie?

38:07.630 --> 38:10.121
I said, leave me alone.

38:14.103 --> 38:17.539
Is it me, or was he a little mad?

38:17.740 --> 38:19.503
I wonder, is Dave mad? Yes.

38:19.675 --> 38:21.336
He really did have garlic breath.

38:21.510 --> 38:23.034
Yeah, well-played, guys.

38:23.246 --> 38:25.009
Idea.

38:25.181 --> 38:26.375
Who has cab fare?

38:26.549 --> 38:29.780
Cab fare?
We don't even have pockets.

38:53.509 --> 38:58.412
<i>Dear fellas, I'm sorry,
but this isn't really working out.</i>

38:59.815 --> 39:02.807
<i>I don't know what made me think
I could handle you guys...</i>

39:02.985 --> 39:05.351
<i>... when I can barely manage
my own life.</i>

39:05.521 --> 39:08.922
<i>You should go back to your real home
in the forest.</i>

39:09.091 --> 39:11.218
<i>That's what's best for all of us.</i>

39:11.661 --> 39:14.687
<i>I'm sorry it has to be this way, but...</i>

39:34.583 --> 39:36.346
Guys?

39:37.253 --> 39:39.847
Simon, Theodore?

39:43.225 --> 39:44.852
Guys?

39:47.463 --> 39:49.328
Alvin?

39:51.233 --> 39:54.430
Alvin!

39:58.074 --> 39:59.905
Simon?

40:02.778 --> 40:04.541
Theodore?

40:05.414 --> 40:07.143
Alvin?

40:08.751 --> 40:09.843
Alvin.

40:30.404 --> 40:31.962
Hello?

40:32.907 --> 40:34.636
Hello?

40:35.509 --> 40:37.136
Kids.

40:41.782 --> 40:46.515
<i>Christmas, Christmastime is near</i>

40:46.687 --> 40:51.351
<i>Time for toys and time for cheer</i>

40:51.525 --> 40:56.019
<i>We can't hardly stand the wait</i>

40:56.197 --> 40:59.496
<i>Please, Christmas, don't be late</i>

41:01.802 --> 41:03.702
Welcome to Jett Records.

41:18.019 --> 41:20.783
Okay. New rule.
No going out after 9.

41:20.955 --> 41:23.287
And not at all unless
I know where you're going.

41:23.457 --> 41:25.152
Were you worried about us, Dave?

41:25.326 --> 41:27.157
No. I just need to know, that's all.

41:27.328 --> 41:30.661
Wait. If you're not worried,
then why do you need to know?

41:30.831 --> 41:33.231
I need to know, okay?

41:42.443 --> 41:44.138
Alvin.

41:48.749 --> 41:52.583
Oh, sorry about that. Yeah.

41:52.753 --> 41:54.414
- Sorry.
- Kids, huh?

41:54.588 --> 41:56.818
They keep you on your toes.
Do you have any?

41:56.991 --> 41:58.253
Three boys.

41:58.459 --> 42:00.427
Well, some days
are better than others.

42:00.594 --> 42:03.188
And some days
you just wanna close them in a box...

42:03.364 --> 42:06.094
...leave the box in the park
and run away, you know?

42:15.876 --> 42:17.468
Quick, hide.

42:19.747 --> 42:21.442
Guys, what's all this?

42:21.615 --> 42:23.515
Toaster waffles.

42:23.684 --> 42:26.244
You know, I can't afford
all these toaster waffles.

42:27.221 --> 42:29.280
- What?
- Well, in case you didn't notice...

42:29.490 --> 42:30.923
...I don't have a job anymo...

42:40.034 --> 42:41.433
My song?

42:43.104 --> 42:44.799
- All right.
- Yeah.

42:50.811 --> 42:52.938
- Hello?
- Hey, Dave.

42:53.114 --> 42:56.606
Hey, how's my favorite songwriter?

42:56.951 --> 42:58.942
<i>- Ian?
- Tell me you've heard the song.</i>

42:59.120 --> 43:01.247
Yeah. I'm listening to it right now.

43:01.422 --> 43:02.787
How did you...? When did...?

43:02.957 --> 43:06.984
Speed of business, baby.
That's how we do it. That's how I roll.

43:07.161 --> 43:10.153
Got a friend in satellite radio,
put it in immediate rotation.

43:10.331 --> 43:14.665
And that video of your little guys,
10 million hits already on YouTube.

43:17.772 --> 43:19.330
It's crazy. I gotta go.

43:19.540 --> 43:22.839
Hey, put some clothes on those guys.
It's kind of embarrassing.

43:28.416 --> 43:30.680
We owed you, Dave.

43:31.452 --> 43:35.479
So we're good
with the toaster waffles, right? Dave?

44:10.458 --> 44:12.323
Soup's on.

44:31.679 --> 44:32.703
Alvin.

44:44.158 --> 44:45.853
So, what do you think?

44:46.026 --> 44:47.323
Cool.

45:17.958 --> 45:19.516
All right.

45:26.033 --> 45:29.025
Toothbrush, huh? Okay.

45:33.741 --> 45:34.799
No.

45:50.457 --> 45:52.084
Dave...

45:52.726 --> 45:54.591
...are you awake?

45:54.762 --> 45:55.820
I am now.

45:55.996 --> 45:57.327
I had a nightmare.

45:58.699 --> 46:00.394
Can I sleep with you?

46:02.970 --> 46:04.437
You won't even know I'm here.

46:05.239 --> 46:07.639
Okay. Sure.
But stay on that side of the bed.

46:07.808 --> 46:10.299
Oh, okay.

46:24.725 --> 46:28.217
Theodore, that's not your side
of the bed.

46:48.983 --> 46:53.044
- Theodore, wake up. It's Christmas.
- Come on, man. It's Christmas.

46:53.253 --> 46:54.447
Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

46:54.622 --> 46:56.681
<i>On the first day of Christmas
Dave woke up</i>

46:56.857 --> 46:58.984
Come on, man, it's Christmas.
Hallelujah.

46:59.159 --> 47:00.490
Wake up, lazy bones.

47:00.661 --> 47:03.129
Oh, yeah. Christmas.

47:03.297 --> 47:05.629
- Up and at them.
- You can sleep when you're dead.

47:05.799 --> 47:07.027
- I'm coming
- Come on, Dave.

47:07.201 --> 47:08.225
Hurry up, Dad.

47:08.402 --> 47:12.133
- Dad?
- Dave. I said Dave.

47:12.306 --> 47:14.797
This is shaping up to be
my favorite Christmas ever.

47:14.975 --> 47:17.205
- You want to open mine first.
- Open mine first.

47:17.378 --> 47:19.972
- No, Dave, mine is better.
- You guys got me presents?

47:20.147 --> 47:21.978
Of course.

47:24.652 --> 47:27.018
All right. Simon?

47:30.991 --> 47:33.357
Wow, it's a...

47:33.527 --> 47:35.017
It's a paper-clip compass.

47:35.596 --> 47:38.497
A paper-clip compass.
Now I'll never get lost.

47:38.666 --> 47:39.928
Me next.

47:40.100 --> 47:41.658
Alvin.

47:47.074 --> 47:49.042
- My wallet.
- Do you like it?

47:49.209 --> 47:52.007
Really? I wanted to get you something
you'd use every day.

47:52.546 --> 47:55.242
And I have been using this
for almost 10 years now.

47:55.816 --> 47:57.681
Very thoughtful, Alvin. Thank you.

47:57.851 --> 48:00.718
Yeah, the look on your face
says it all, Dave.

48:01.889 --> 48:05.188
Oh, nicely done, Theodore.
"To Dav."

48:06.560 --> 48:11.361
Let's see, it says, "Merry Christmas.
Love, Theodore."

48:11.532 --> 48:15.127
And it's got a nice picture
of some pineapples?

48:15.335 --> 48:17.826
Those aren't pineapples.
That's our family.

48:20.474 --> 48:25.207
Look, fellas. Let's make sure
we understand each other here.

48:25.579 --> 48:27.046
I'm not your...

48:28.716 --> 48:31.810
You know,
your dad or anything, right?

48:31.985 --> 48:33.850
But you're like a dad.

48:37.157 --> 48:39.455
Well, not really.

48:39.626 --> 48:42.220
I mean, we're friends for sure.

48:42.396 --> 48:45.490
And I write your music, you know,
manage your career.

48:45.666 --> 48:47.998
- Make us sweaters.
- Feed us.

48:48.168 --> 48:51.069
Let us sleep in your bed
when we have nightmares.

48:51.505 --> 48:53.405
That's what friends do.

48:56.143 --> 48:58.168
So who wants to open their presents?

48:58.378 --> 49:00.573
- Is that a trick question? We do.
- Yeah.

49:00.748 --> 49:02.579
- Presents.
- Oh, boy.

49:02.750 --> 49:04.149
Presents. Presents. Presents.

49:04.318 --> 49:06.309
I can't wait to open mine first.

49:06.487 --> 49:07.784
Envelopes.

49:11.391 --> 49:12.824
They're savings bonds.

49:12.993 --> 49:14.324
Cool.

49:14.495 --> 49:18.363
You know, in seven years, you're
gonna get to buy something really nice.

49:18.532 --> 49:22.400
Do you maybe have any
that you bought seven years ago?

49:23.504 --> 49:26.667
- Alvin, manners.
- Thank you, Dave.

49:26.840 --> 49:29.331
Yeah. Thanks, Dave.

49:32.446 --> 49:35.847
- Ian?
- Who wants presents?

49:36.617 --> 49:37.982
- All right.
- Cool.

49:38.152 --> 49:40.313
Hey, there's plenty more
where this came from.

49:40.487 --> 49:41.954
Bring them on in, fellas.

49:42.122 --> 49:44.056
- Oh, yeah.
- Jackpot.

49:44.224 --> 49:46.055
What are you doing?

49:46.226 --> 49:49.354
- Taking care of my boys.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

49:49.530 --> 49:51.498
Weird. What happened
to your presents?

49:51.665 --> 49:54.361
- Which one is mine?
- That big one is for me, I think.

49:54.535 --> 49:55.661
What did you get them?

49:56.470 --> 49:57.801
Savings bonds.

49:57.971 --> 50:00.064
Great. Just what every kid dreams of.

50:00.240 --> 50:02.401
You're in luck.
Your uncle Ian came through.

50:02.576 --> 50:05.443
- Cool.
- Uncle Ian?

50:06.880 --> 50:08.404
Is... Is this for me?

50:08.582 --> 50:10.072
No, it's for Simon.

50:10.250 --> 50:12.684
- Theodore.
- Oh, boy.

50:13.220 --> 50:17.987
- And Alvin.
- Thank you, Santa.

50:18.158 --> 50:20.649
This is for you.
You like the Oak Ridge Boys, right?

50:20.828 --> 50:22.352
Yeah, you're welcome.

50:22.529 --> 50:23.860
And guess what, guys.

50:24.031 --> 50:27.558
Uncle Ian is gonna have
a big launch party for the new CD.

50:27.734 --> 50:31.761
That's right. Press, paparazzi.
Hollywood hotshots.

50:31.972 --> 50:33.269
The whole nine yards.

50:33.473 --> 50:34.599
- Awesome.
- Sweet.

50:34.775 --> 50:38.438
Yeah. Dave, you've got one week
to write me a new hit single.

50:38.612 --> 50:40.409
All right? Something funky and fresh.

50:40.581 --> 50:42.845
- Peace. We out.
- Bye, Uncle Ian.

50:43.016 --> 50:46.008
- Merry Christmas.
- Now it really is Christmas.

50:46.186 --> 50:48.620
Mayday, mayday.

50:49.590 --> 50:52.218
This way, this way, this way.

50:52.392 --> 50:56.954
All right. All right. Settle in, settle in.
Thank you for coming.

50:57.130 --> 50:59.894
It is a very special night tonight.

51:00.067 --> 51:05.972
Here at Jett Records, we pride ourselves
on bringing you tomorrow's music today.

51:06.139 --> 51:09.074
Oh, and guess what. I did it again.

51:09.243 --> 51:12.906
Ladies and gentlemen,
here to sing their new hit single...

51:13.080 --> 51:19.883
...give it up
for Alvin, Simon and Theodore.

51:20.053 --> 51:22.715
<i>Yeah, in the place to be</i>

51:22.890 --> 51:27.293
<i>Chipmunks on the M-l-C

<i>I told the witch doctor
I was in love with you</i>

51:46.480 --> 51:49.813
<i>I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me too</i>

<i>And then the witch doctor
He told me what to do</i>

52:13.206 --> 52:14.833
<i>- Can they do it?
- Go! Go! Go!</i>

<i>Come on, people, let's get to it</i>

52:16.843 --> 52:18.333

53:44.731 --> 53:46.528
Yeah.

53:49.936 --> 53:52.234
All right, party people.
You know how we do it.

53:52.406 --> 53:55.569
Get on that dance floor,
let me see what you got.

54:04.284 --> 54:06.548
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

54:06.720 --> 54:08.915
- You mind if I grab a few pics?
- Claire.

54:10.390 --> 54:12.187
- Not at all. Fire away.
- Great.

54:12.759 --> 54:16.251
I've got a new assignment.
I'm covering your rise to fame.

54:18.432 --> 54:21.401
- Oh, this is Alvin, Simon and Theodore.
- Hi.

54:21.568 --> 54:22.933
- Hello.
- Hi, Claire.

54:23.103 --> 54:24.593
You're hot.

54:25.505 --> 54:27.564
Forgot you guys haven't officially met.

54:32.345 --> 54:34.074
So, Dave...

54:34.247 --> 54:37.114
...l'm sorry about that night.
I really thought that you...

54:37.284 --> 54:38.444
That I was insane?

54:39.219 --> 54:40.811
I totally understand it.

54:40.987 --> 54:44.184
Talking chipmunks.
It's a lot to take in over dinner.

54:44.357 --> 54:49.317
But look at you now. You've got
the career, promising future, kids.

54:49.496 --> 54:50.588
You're like a family.

54:50.764 --> 54:53.858
Don't say "family" in front of Dave.
It gives him gas.

54:54.034 --> 54:57.970
- Like, clear-the-room gas.
- Does not.

54:58.138 --> 54:59.799
He doesn't want a family.

54:59.973 --> 55:02.874
Why don't you guys go and play
or raid the dessert table?

55:03.043 --> 55:04.874
Don't take it personally, you guys.

55:05.045 --> 55:07.775
Some people don't know a good thing
when they've got it.

55:07.948 --> 55:09.677
Right, Dave?

55:11.151 --> 55:12.846
Claire.

55:13.253 --> 55:17.519
No offense, big guy,
but you are not good at this.

55:24.965 --> 55:26.489
Hey, what do you think of this?

55:27.033 --> 55:29.331
- What is it?
- It's Alvin.

55:29.503 --> 55:31.300
That looks nothing like Alvin.

55:31.471 --> 55:34.998
Well, yeah. It's a prototype.
We'll sell a million of these things.

55:35.175 --> 55:38.008
It's voice-activated.
Here, say something to it.

55:38.879 --> 55:43.714
Hello, ugly little Alvin doll
that looks nothing like Alvin.

55:45.552 --> 55:48.988
- See? You love it. It's Spanish.
- You know what? That's just weird.

55:49.156 --> 55:50.555
Come on, Dave, Dave, Dave.

55:50.724 --> 55:52.988
We've got to expand
the Munks' fan base.

55:53.160 --> 55:55.594
I mean, forget about the music.

55:55.795 --> 55:59.526
The music is but a means
to the big money, okay?

55:59.699 --> 56:03.328
I'm talking about our own
fur clothing line, cologne.

56:03.503 --> 56:06.495
Chipmunk Heat, something like that.
Chipmunk wine coolers.

56:06.673 --> 56:08.106
- I mean...
- They're just kids.

56:08.308 --> 56:09.536
No, they're rats.

56:09.709 --> 56:13.008
And they could make us both
so much money...

56:13.180 --> 56:17.913
...if you just let me work with them.
- I can't hear you, the music's too loud.

56:18.084 --> 56:23.420
Don't go against me on this, Dave.
I never lose.

56:31.765 --> 56:34.563
Has anyone tried
the chocolate meatballs?

56:34.734 --> 56:37.794
I'll probably go into insulin shock.
But it's worth it.

56:37.971 --> 56:41.634
Oh, a sweet, sweet,
sweet molasses meat.

56:41.841 --> 56:45.902
Hey, Alvster. Love the song, bro.

56:46.079 --> 56:48.707
- Up top.
- What's up, player?

56:49.282 --> 56:52.877
So I see you're enjoying my little spread
that I've put out for you guys.

56:53.053 --> 56:56.216
What am I talking about?
You probably eat like this all the time.

56:56.389 --> 56:58.880
Well, Dave says
he doesn't wanna spoil us.

56:59.059 --> 57:02.620
Dude, you're a rock star.
You're supposed to be spoiled.

57:02.796 --> 57:06.163
I mean, you should be riding
in limousines and private planes.

57:06.366 --> 57:09.995
And you should be going to parties
like this every night.

57:10.170 --> 57:12.297
Really?
Because Dave says we need our sleep.

57:13.473 --> 57:18.069
Look, Alvin, this is hard to say
but, I mean, I gotta be upfront about it.

57:18.245 --> 57:23.114
Dave's holding you back, you know.
I could be making you 20 large a day.

57:23.283 --> 57:25.911
- Is that a lot?
- Yes.

57:26.086 --> 57:28.782
Another thing... I'm not gonna tell you.
I will tell you.

57:28.955 --> 57:32.982
Look, behind your back,
Dave calls you...

57:34.294 --> 57:35.420
..."the rats."

57:38.031 --> 57:40.829
- Rats?
- Yeah. Whatever, right? I know.

57:41.001 --> 57:44.869
Well, don't let it bother you.
I mean, me? I consider you boys family.

57:45.038 --> 57:47.666
And if there's anything you need,
anything at all...

57:47.841 --> 57:50.867
...give your uncle Ian a call, all right?

57:51.044 --> 57:54.411
- Oh, right.
- Ciao.

57:58.618 --> 58:02.110
Come on, pal.
You drive like my grandmother.

58:02.289 --> 58:03.847
Get a wheelchair. Move over!

58:04.724 --> 58:09.821
Hey, guys, look at me.
Up, up and away.

58:12.165 --> 58:14.133
Alvin.

58:14.668 --> 58:17.728
Can't help you, Simon.
I'm about to take the lead here.

58:17.937 --> 58:20.030
Hey, guys,
I have an idea for a new song.

58:21.541 --> 58:22.735
Hey, Dave.

58:22.942 --> 58:26.036
What's going on in here?
I thought I told you guys to clean up.

58:26.212 --> 58:27.873
We are.

58:32.052 --> 58:35.749
- Who's that?
- Uncle Ian hired us a housekeeper.

58:35.955 --> 58:38.048
She's also a masseuse.

58:42.062 --> 58:44.053
Come on, move over, road hog.

58:44.230 --> 58:47.063
Drive it or park it, pal.
Get in the slow lane.

58:47.233 --> 58:49.428
- Where did you get that game?
- Uncle Ian.

58:49.602 --> 58:52.537
Move it or lose it!
Get some training wheels, buddy.

58:53.039 --> 58:54.836
Okay, you know what?

58:55.008 --> 58:56.771
That's enough.

58:57.243 --> 58:59.837
What are you doing?
I was about to beat my high score.

59:00.013 --> 59:02.379
Too bad. Where's Theodore?

59:06.052 --> 59:07.679
Spit it out.

59:07.854 --> 59:10.220
- Spit it out.
- No.

59:12.092 --> 59:13.184
Jett Records.

59:13.727 --> 59:17.754
Okay. That's it. Meeting. Now.
Everyone on the couch.

59:18.398 --> 59:20.525
Could you give us a minute?

59:24.003 --> 59:27.530
Guys, look, it's hard, I know.

59:27.707 --> 59:32.110
Three months ago, you were hanging out
in a tree somewhere and now you're...

59:32.278 --> 59:35.247
Major rock stars.

59:35.415 --> 59:38.316
Okay. Whatever.
My point is just because you're...

59:38.518 --> 59:40.145
Major rock stars.

59:43.623 --> 59:45.989
Doesn't mean you can have or do
whatever you want.

59:46.159 --> 59:48.719
Well, Uncle Ian says
we should always be happy.

59:48.895 --> 59:50.453
Okay, you know what?

59:50.630 --> 59:52.962
He's not your uncle.

59:53.166 --> 59:58.900
He also, David, said
that we should be making $20 a day.

59:59.072 --> 01:00:01.302
Guess what.
You're making way more than that.

01:00:01.474 --> 01:00:04.170
And because I care,
I'm putting it all away for you.

01:00:04.344 --> 01:00:06.403
Just like storing nuts for the winter.

01:00:06.579 --> 01:00:08.410
Oh, winter's for losers.

01:00:08.581 --> 01:00:12.073
Yeah. Shouldn't we have a say
in how to build our investment portfolio?

01:00:12.552 --> 01:00:16.249
Where is all this coming from?
You guys are just kids.

01:00:16.423 --> 01:00:20.018
- Kids, Dave, or rats?
- What?

01:00:20.193 --> 01:00:22.991
Well, Uncle Ian says
we're like his family.

01:00:23.163 --> 01:00:25.996
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you love Uncle Ian so much...

01:00:26.166 --> 01:00:28.327
...and don't think I'm watching out
for you...

01:00:28.501 --> 01:00:30.662
...why don't you go live
with Uncle Ian?

01:00:41.881 --> 01:00:43.439
Dave?

01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:45.783
Are you still mad at us?

01:00:46.986 --> 01:00:48.681
Dave?

01:00:58.031 --> 01:01:01.228
"Dear fellas, I'm sorry, but...

01:01:02.001 --> 01:01:05.459
You should go back
to your real home in the forest."

01:01:05.638 --> 01:01:08.471
I guess he really does want us to go.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.185
I told you, Dave.

01:01:22.355 --> 01:01:24.346
I never lose.

01:01:50.884 --> 01:01:55.287
Boys, welcome to your new home.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:05.187
- Oh, yeah. Daddy's home.
- Yeah.

01:02:05.365 --> 01:02:07.629
Can we play with all this stuff?

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.200
Sure, why not? It's your house.

01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:12.736
So, what are the rules around here?

01:02:13.473 --> 01:02:16.806
Oh, I do have one rule...

01:02:16.976 --> 01:02:20.104
...that there are no rules!
- Cool.

01:02:31.424 --> 01:02:33.551
Four degrees elevation.

01:02:33.726 --> 01:02:36.058
Six degrees azimuth.

01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:39.221
Fire!

01:02:50.777 --> 01:02:53.678
Prepare to face the fury
of my vengeance.

01:02:53.846 --> 01:02:55.973
Don't make me laugh.

01:02:56.149 --> 01:02:58.640
Pray for a quick demise,
young chipmunk.

01:02:58.818 --> 01:03:01.116
Uppercut. Left. Fake-out, fake-out.

01:03:09.862 --> 01:03:13.525
Your kung fu is no match
for my rockets.

01:03:15.134 --> 01:03:16.726
Sneak attack.

01:03:19.439 --> 01:03:21.168
Okay, Simon. That's enough.

01:03:21.641 --> 01:03:23.768
I'm finished now. Simon.

01:03:23.943 --> 01:03:25.968
- Hey, give me that.
- Let go, Alvin.

01:03:26.145 --> 01:03:27.237
Oh, come on.

01:03:30.283 --> 01:03:32.274
- You had a turn.
- Who says you get a turn?

01:03:32.452 --> 01:03:33.680
Give me that.

01:03:36.823 --> 01:03:38.620
Simon!

01:03:38.791 --> 01:03:41.055
- You got to try.
- Get your mangy paws off of it.

01:03:44.063 --> 01:03:45.621
- Scram.
- I want it.

01:03:45.798 --> 01:03:47.789
Alvin, you don't decide.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.042
- Why didn't the airbags deploy?
- Theodore, don't go into the light.

01:04:05.551 --> 01:04:08.042
- Let's do it again.
- Awesome.

01:04:08.221 --> 01:04:10.155
- Playing hard?
- Oh, yes.

01:04:10.323 --> 01:04:12.052
Good.

01:04:12.225 --> 01:04:17.094
Because tomorrow, you start working hard.
Coast to coast in five days.

01:04:17.296 --> 01:04:20.595
Well, Dave says that touring is no life
for a kid.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.496
For a normal kid.
You guys are superstars.

01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:25.661
- Yes.
- Which reminds me...

01:04:25.838 --> 01:04:28.739
...Simon, let's get rid of these
boring glasses.

01:04:29.242 --> 01:04:35.181
And try on these super cool
in-the-now glasses.

01:04:35.348 --> 01:04:37.248
Oh, my God, oh.

01:04:37.417 --> 01:04:40.409
These would be great
if I could see out of them.

01:04:40.586 --> 01:04:44.454
Your eyes will adjust.
Come on, boys. Let's hit the road.

01:04:44.624 --> 01:04:46.091
- Shotgun.
- Hit the road.

01:04:46.259 --> 01:04:47.817
Alvin...

01:05:38.244 --> 01:05:40.940
Give me a big fella. Alvin, big, big.

01:05:41.681 --> 01:05:44.980
No hiding. Come on, come on.
Make love to the camera.

01:05:45.151 --> 01:05:50.282
Sell it. Big smile. Yes.
Theodore, chin out. Yeah. That's it.

01:05:50.456 --> 01:05:53.323
Good stuff. There you go.
Come on, get in there.

01:05:53.493 --> 01:05:55.518
Strong. Give me some booty.

01:05:55.695 --> 01:05:58.926
Spank it. There you got it.
Now you got it.

01:06:06.139 --> 01:06:10.701
If the Chipmunks like Crunchy Nibbles,
your pet will love them.

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:12.605
Cut.

01:06:13.112 --> 01:06:14.943
Here we are.

01:06:16.649 --> 01:06:18.446
Okay? All right?

01:07:01.961 --> 01:07:03.223
Hold it.

01:07:03.396 --> 01:07:04.522
We're not done.

01:07:04.697 --> 01:07:05.994
- You tell me.
- Killing me.

01:07:06.165 --> 01:07:08.224
- What do you want?
- You are killing me here.

01:07:08.401 --> 01:07:11.268
There's no button I can push
that wakes them to sing notes.

01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:13.370
You kidding?
There's 5000 buttons here.

01:07:13.539 --> 01:07:16.337
- What button do you want me to push?
- Fine. I've got it.

01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:22.340
All right, guys. Guess what your
uncle Ian brought you. Coffee.

01:07:23.382 --> 01:07:25.111
I love toffee.

01:07:25.284 --> 01:07:30.847
No, it's coffee, Theodore, coffee. It's a...
Like a super cool energy health drink...

01:07:31.023 --> 01:07:37.895
...with whipped cream and caramel
and two pumps of chocolate.

01:07:38.231 --> 01:07:40.096
Enjoy.

01:07:42.602 --> 01:07:44.433
That ought to keep them awake.

01:08:29.515 --> 01:08:31.448
<i>- Get munk'd
- Go, go, go</i>

01:08:31.617 --> 01:08:34.984
<i>Yeah, Chipmunks
Always can get munk'd</i>

01:08:35.154 --> 01:08:36.917
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

01:08:37.089 --> 01:08:39.353
<i>Come and get munk'd
With the Chipmunk rugrats</i>

01:08:39.558 --> 01:08:43.085
<i>Come and get munk'd with the Munks
Get munk'd with the Chipmunk rugrats</i>

01:08:43.261 --> 01:08:44.923
<i>Come and get munk'd with the Munks</i>

01:08:45.096 --> 01:08:48.828
Stop, stop. Come on, guys.
We need more energy, okay?

01:08:49.001 --> 01:08:53.700
We need more dry ice. We need more,
you know, wow. All right?

01:08:53.872 --> 01:08:55.841
We're the Chipmunks,
for crying out loud.

01:08:56.008 --> 01:08:58.805
This is absurd.
I feel like P. Diddy with fur.

01:08:58.978 --> 01:09:02.640
And to be honest, the new songs
don't really sound like us.

01:09:02.814 --> 01:09:06.478
Well, you know what I think? I think
the new direction is perfect, you know.

01:09:06.652 --> 01:09:08.676
It's all about today's edge.

01:09:08.854 --> 01:09:11.049
Dave always said
it was all about the music.

01:09:11.223 --> 01:09:12.520
"Dave always said..."

01:09:12.692 --> 01:09:17.823
You know what? Dave, Dave, Dave.
Dave is not here, okay? It's me.

01:09:17.997 --> 01:09:21.899
It's fun Uncle Ian, all right? Okay?

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:27.066
What are you...? What are you
gonna say? What's your name?

01:09:27.238 --> 01:09:30.174
- Taffy.
- Taffy? What kind of name is Taffy?

01:09:30.343 --> 01:09:31.707
What do you do?

01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:34.868
- Choreography.
- I don't know what "choreography" is.

01:09:35.046 --> 01:09:37.640
- What is that?
- It's dance.

01:09:37.817 --> 01:09:43.551
Oh, is it dancing? Well, next time say,
you know, "I'm the dance guy..." Hello?

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:47.551
Who? Dave Seville.

01:09:48.027 --> 01:09:50.221
Name rings a bell. A dead...

01:09:50.563 --> 01:09:51.689
<i>... broken bell.</i>

01:09:51.863 --> 01:09:55.197
<i>- Just let me talk to the guys.
- I don't think that's such a good idea.</i>

01:09:55.368 --> 01:09:58.826
The boys are still stinging a little bit
from you kicking them out.

01:09:59.005 --> 01:10:02.168
- That's not what happened.
- Denial.

01:10:02.341 --> 01:10:04.741
So, what's this I hear
about a European tour?

01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:07.435
You're taking them away
for six months?

01:10:07.646 --> 01:10:10.706
No, 12 actually.
If we can get China to go chipmunk.

01:10:10.883 --> 01:10:12.612
Twelve?

01:10:12.785 --> 01:10:15.879
Look, I just wanted to say hi.
See how they're doing.

01:10:16.055 --> 01:10:18.046
They're doing great.
They're loving life.

01:10:18.224 --> 01:10:19.691
<i>Living large.</i>

01:10:19.859 --> 01:10:23.022
Face it, Dave. They've moved on.

01:10:23.195 --> 01:10:26.221
- They're happy now.
- Look, Ian, I wanna talk to them.

01:10:26.399 --> 01:10:27.457
<i>Put them on the phone.</i>

01:10:27.666 --> 01:10:30.100
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna happen, Dave.

01:10:30.269 --> 01:10:32.237
<i>Got a world tour,
gonna start tomorrow.</i>

01:10:32.405 --> 01:10:34.635
And these guys don't need
the extra pressure.

01:10:34.807 --> 01:10:37.367
<i>- We'll send you a postcard.
- Ian, you can't do this.</i>

01:10:37.543 --> 01:10:40.603
They're not ready for something
like that. They're just kids.

01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:43.749
- I'm gonna see them.
- Look, Dave, I'm... Wait.

01:10:43.916 --> 01:10:45.042
<i>- Ian?
- Yeah? What?</i>

01:10:45.217 --> 01:10:47.242
- Ian.
- I can't...

01:10:53.993 --> 01:10:55.483
Ian...

01:10:55.694 --> 01:10:57.321
...was that Dave?

01:11:00.332 --> 01:11:03.392
Yes. Yes, it was.

01:11:03.569 --> 01:11:06.231
He wanted me to let you know
he's great and he's happy.

01:11:06.405 --> 01:11:09.272
He's really, really happy. So... All right.

01:11:09.442 --> 01:11:12.138
And is he coming to the show?

01:11:14.647 --> 01:11:18.640
You know what? I sent him tickets.
And here's the thing, he sent them back.

01:11:18.818 --> 01:11:23.949
Yeah, I know. I guess he's busy,
you know. Got better things to do.

01:11:24.123 --> 01:11:26.523
Hey, come on.
What's with the long furry faces?

01:11:26.725 --> 01:11:29.091
We're gonna have fun.
We're gonna have a big show.

01:11:29.261 --> 01:11:32.492
I'll tell you what, you guys like
deep-tissue massage? All right?

01:11:32.665 --> 01:11:35.361
I know a guy. Let me call my guy.
I'll get on that.

01:11:35.801 --> 01:11:38.326
Hey, captain, come here.

01:11:38.504 --> 01:11:39.630
Listen.

01:11:39.805 --> 01:11:43.332
Dave Seville.
Learn the name, look for the face.

01:11:43.509 --> 01:11:46.706
If he shows up tomorrow night,
he doesn't get near my chipmunks.

01:11:46.879 --> 01:11:49.780
- Got it? Okay.
- Got it.

01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:05.290
Uncle Ian?

01:12:12.004 --> 01:12:15.167
- What are you doing here?
- Can I sleep with you?

01:12:15.341 --> 01:12:16.706
I had a nightmare.

01:12:17.143 --> 01:12:20.408
Oh, you had a nightmare?

01:12:20.579 --> 01:12:23.742
I had a nightmare too.
In my nightmare...

01:12:23.916 --> 01:12:30.321
...I had to put together 37 dates
in 42 days, in 16 different countries.

01:12:30.489 --> 01:12:35.654
And I had to coordinate 121
different radio and print interviews...

01:12:35.828 --> 01:12:38.194
...in five different languages.

01:12:38.364 --> 01:12:41.231
But you know what, Theo?
The only difference is...

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:46.929
...in my nightmare, when I open
my eyes, it doesn't end.

01:12:47.106 --> 01:12:50.166
So is that a no?

01:13:20.973 --> 01:13:22.634
Guys...

01:13:22.942 --> 01:13:24.807
...I wanna go home.

01:13:24.977 --> 01:13:27.309
What do you mean? You are home.

01:13:27.479 --> 01:13:30.141
No, I mean, "home" home.

01:13:30.349 --> 01:13:32.374
You know, with Dave.

01:13:32.551 --> 01:13:36.248
But, Theodore, come on.
Wake up and smell the toffee.

01:13:36.422 --> 01:13:42.418
Dave doesn't even want us. He doesn't
care enough to even come to our show.

01:13:44.263 --> 01:13:47.630
<i>Here's Julianne Reynolds
with today's entertainment news.</i>

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:50.268
<i>Too tired to rock?
The Chipmunks might be.</i>

01:13:50.436 --> 01:13:54.497
<i>Rumor of exhaustion and voice strain are
swirling around the singing sensation.</i>

01:13:54.673 --> 01:13:58.837
<i>Is it because of toaster waffle overload?
Or a rigorous tour schedule?</i>

01:13:59.011 --> 01:14:02.503
<i>It's hard to say. But manager-producer
Ian Hawke has assured Fox...</i>

01:14:02.681 --> 01:14:05.081
<i>... the trio will make
their first stop tonight...</i>

01:14:05.251 --> 01:14:10.985
<i>... on their highly anticipated world tour
at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles.</i>

01:14:13.025 --> 01:14:14.652
That's it.

01:14:35.281 --> 01:14:36.942
Okay.

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:44.783
You three sound like
you've been gargling nails.

01:14:45.924 --> 01:14:48.552
- I'll cover for you.
- Thank you.

01:14:49.695 --> 01:14:51.526
Can we get Wardrobe
down here, please?

01:14:51.697 --> 01:14:53.289
Well?

01:14:53.465 --> 01:14:58.198
I could give you a lot of fancy terms,
but, bottom line, they're exhausted.

01:14:58.370 --> 01:15:02.136
Okay, well, give them a shot
or a cream or a pill or something.

01:15:02.308 --> 01:15:05.641
I've invested every dime I have
in these guys.

01:15:05.811 --> 01:15:08.245
They need a long rest.

01:15:08.447 --> 01:15:12.747
A long rest. Are you...? Okay.
Yeah, a long rest, right.

01:15:13.052 --> 01:15:15.350
Right, yeah. I'm not a doctor, so...

01:15:15.521 --> 01:15:18.319
I'll get them that rest. Thank you.
I'll take care of it.

01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:21.391
Thank you so much. I will...
I appreciate it. Hey, hey, doc.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.755
Chipmunk fever, catch it.

01:15:25.898 --> 01:15:27.763
Knock, knock.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.597
So listen, guys,
I just talked to the doctor.

01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:34.830
And I don't feel right about
sending you guys out like this.

01:15:35.474 --> 01:15:37.567
So you're gonna cancel the show?

01:15:38.177 --> 01:15:41.237
No. No,
then I'd have to give out refunds.

01:15:41.413 --> 01:15:45.679
No. What I'm talking about
is having you guys lip-synch. Yeah.

01:15:45.851 --> 01:15:47.284
Isn't that like cheating?

01:15:47.486 --> 01:15:51.115
No, it's not like cheating. It's...
Cheating is wrong.

01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:54.589
This is more like helping.
Yeah, all the superstars do it.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.696
Just make sure that you mouth the
words exactly like we recorded them.

01:15:58.864 --> 01:16:01.594
- Otherwise, people will know.
- That we're cheating.

01:16:03.235 --> 01:16:07.137
- No.
- Guys, what other choice do we have?

01:16:07.306 --> 01:16:10.605
Yeah. See?
That's why he's the one with the letter.

01:16:10.776 --> 01:16:12.744
All right, guys, tighten up.

01:16:12.911 --> 01:16:18.281
And remember, mouth the words
and no one will know.

01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:20.042
Love you.

01:16:29.094 --> 01:16:30.425
<i>You know you got it made</i>

01:16:30.596 --> 01:16:32.826
<i>When you drop your Escalade
For the drop top</i>

01:16:33.031 --> 01:16:35.591
<i>Iced out, rocks hot
Droppin' dollars, ladies holler</i>

01:16:35.768 --> 01:16:40.102
<i>Hey, gotta get that cream</i>

01:16:40.272 --> 01:16:42.740
<i>You know you got it made
When they send in a parade</i>

01:16:42.908 --> 01:16:45.001
<i>When you drop down
Write a check in town</i>

01:16:45.177 --> 01:16:47.941
<i>All just for one day</i>

01:16:48.113 --> 01:16:51.674
<i>Gotta get that cream</i>

01:16:55.454 --> 01:17:01.086
<i>- Don't you know that's how they roll?
- Roll, roll, roll</i>

01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:06.857
<i>Can you get down with the
Funk, funk, funk of the Chipmunks?</i>

01:17:07.065 --> 01:17:08.259
<i>Baby, you know</i>

01:17:08.434 --> 01:17:12.495
<i>Funk, funk, funk of the Chipmunks</i>

01:17:18.677 --> 01:17:21.339
Oh, come on,
you gotta have one more ticket.

01:17:21.513 --> 01:17:22.878
Sorry.

01:17:23.816 --> 01:17:25.841
<i>Come on, here's Theodore</i>

01:17:26.018 --> 01:17:28.486
<i>You're here to stay
When you're always getting paid</i>

01:17:28.654 --> 01:17:33.853
<i>And it don't stop, never, no
It won't stop no matter what they say</i>

01:17:34.026 --> 01:17:36.688
<i>- Gotta live the dream
- Take it, Simon</i>

01:17:36.862 --> 01:17:39.456
<i>You're here to stay
When your honeys think you hit</i>

01:17:39.631 --> 01:17:41.690
<i>'Cause we gots it
Everybody watch it</i>

01:17:41.867 --> 01:17:46.668
I love it. You love it? Chipmunk fever.
Catch it, baby.

01:17:50.409 --> 01:17:51.535
Dave Seville.

01:17:52.411 --> 01:17:55.209
No, there's no Dave Seville
on this list.

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:59.043
<i>You know what? That's fine.
I'm the editor of the L.A. Music Journal.</i>

01:17:59.218 --> 01:18:01.186
- No, I don't think so.
- He's with me.

01:18:02.521 --> 01:18:04.512
He's my assistant.

01:18:05.624 --> 01:18:06.750
Okay.

01:18:07.226 --> 01:18:08.318
Thanks, Claire.

01:18:08.494 --> 01:18:10.928
What's going on, Dave?
What are you...?

01:18:13.565 --> 01:18:16.932
I gotta get my boys back
but Ian's trying to keep me out.

01:18:17.135 --> 01:18:18.329
Your boys.

01:18:18.871 --> 01:18:21.431
I know that probably sounds weird
coming from me.

01:18:22.074 --> 01:18:23.837
It's a good weird, though.

01:18:24.343 --> 01:18:27.437
Because after all I did to mess up
everything, including you...

01:18:27.646 --> 01:18:32.743
- Dave, your boys. We should go.
- Right. Okay.

01:18:33.352 --> 01:18:36.788
<i>How we roll</i>

01:18:36.955 --> 01:18:39.423
<i>How we roll</i>

01:18:39.791 --> 01:18:41.918
<i>Come on, can you feel it?</i>

01:18:42.094 --> 01:18:46.360
<i>- How we roll
- Yeah, yeah, come on</i>

01:18:46.765 --> 01:18:49.791
If you're gonna do something,
do it fast. Here.

01:18:49.968 --> 01:18:52.198
- You're press, remember?
- Thanks.

01:18:52.371 --> 01:18:57.240
<i>Roll</i>

01:18:57.943 --> 01:18:59.740
- Let's go, pal.
- I'm a photographer.

01:18:59.912 --> 01:19:01.903
- I have a press pass.
- You're out of here.

01:19:02.614 --> 01:19:05.048
Alvin! Alvin!

01:19:07.486 --> 01:19:10.046
Alvin!

01:19:10.222 --> 01:19:14.989
- Dave! He's here.
- It's Dave.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.461
What's going on?

01:19:23.635 --> 01:19:25.296
Alvin, what are you doing?

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:28.303
I'm sending a message
to our dear old uncle Ian.

01:19:28.473 --> 01:19:31.806
- Sounds like a plan to me.
- Me too.

01:19:37.983 --> 01:19:39.610
Come on, guys.

01:19:41.119 --> 01:19:42.211
Hey, Ian...

01:19:43.322 --> 01:19:46.120
...kiss my furry cheeks.

01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:50.592
Here, hold on to that.

01:19:50.996 --> 01:19:52.759
Top of the morning to you.

01:19:58.804 --> 01:20:00.601
Get off my set.

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:03.640
Are you ready to rock?

01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:06.204
Turn it up, girl.

01:20:06.378 --> 01:20:08.312
<i>How we roll</i>

01:20:11.783 --> 01:20:13.011
<i>How we roll</i>

01:20:13.185 --> 01:20:14.550
I feel fine.

01:20:16.288 --> 01:20:21.021
Alvin, Simon, Theodore!
Come on, guys, we're going home.

01:20:21.193 --> 01:20:23.127
Move, move.

01:20:24.963 --> 01:20:26.453
Let's go.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.827
- Get them.
- Look out. Run.

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.735
Hi.

01:20:36.908 --> 01:20:38.170
Bye.

01:20:38.777 --> 01:20:42.213
<i>Eenie, meenie, minie, mo</i>

01:20:42.381 --> 01:20:45.908
<i>Miss a chipmunk because you're slow</i>

01:20:47.853 --> 01:20:49.753
Watch your knees.

01:20:49.921 --> 01:20:53.254
- Sorry.
- Come on, big fella. Come on. Come on.

01:20:53.425 --> 01:20:55.256
A little bit closer.

01:20:55.427 --> 01:20:58.419
Come on, right there. Perfect.

01:20:59.531 --> 01:21:02.022
He'll feel that in the morning.

01:21:03.902 --> 01:21:06.666
- Guys.
- Dave!

01:21:07.873 --> 01:21:10.171
You're not going anywhere.

01:21:10.809 --> 01:21:11.867
What are you doing?

01:21:12.044 --> 01:21:14.444
- Put us down.
- Let me go.

01:21:14.613 --> 01:21:16.444
- Hey.
- You better study your French.

01:21:16.615 --> 01:21:20.051
- You're going to Paris tonight. Okay?
- Let go. Just had my tail redone.

01:21:20.218 --> 01:21:21.776
- No, wait.
- Put it with my stuff.

01:21:21.953 --> 01:21:24.751
- Let us out of here. Let us out of here.
- No.

01:21:24.923 --> 01:21:27.892
What? Ian, they don't want this anymore.
Just let them go.

01:21:28.927 --> 01:21:32.863
But the guy just left. You should have
said something about five seconds ago.

01:21:33.031 --> 01:21:34.623
Come back.

01:21:35.467 --> 01:21:39.767
Ian, they need a real life.
Not all of this.

01:21:39.938 --> 01:21:42.372
Besides, they just ruined the concert.

01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:46.102
Word will get out,
no one will come to see them.

01:21:46.745 --> 01:21:52.115
Dave, they're chipmunks who talk.
People will come.

01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:54.316
Guys, with me.

01:21:54.486 --> 01:22:00.721
<i>Roll, that's how we roll</i>

01:22:07.299 --> 01:22:09.733
You'll never take us alive.

01:22:09.901 --> 01:22:12.335
They just did take us alive, Alvin.

01:22:12.504 --> 01:22:14.335
It's a figure of speech, Simon.

01:22:14.506 --> 01:22:18.602
Instead of criticizing me, why not use
your big brain to think of a way out?

01:22:31.423 --> 01:22:33.618
Go, go, go. Go.

01:22:43.001 --> 01:22:44.798
Come on.

01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:55.175
Step on it, Dave. You're losing him.

01:23:04.956 --> 01:23:06.821
How did you guys...?

01:23:06.992 --> 01:23:08.482
We are talking chipmunks, Dave.

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:13.290
We can get out of a cat carrier.
Not even hard to do.

01:23:13.465 --> 01:23:15.330
You came back for us.

01:23:16.635 --> 01:23:20.071
Well, of course I came back.
We're a family.

01:23:20.705 --> 01:23:22.229
Holy nuts.

01:23:23.074 --> 01:23:25.167
- What?
- Am I going crazy?

01:23:25.343 --> 01:23:26.935
Or did he just say "family"?

01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:31.481
I know...

01:23:33.185 --> 01:23:35.085
...but I really missed you guys.

01:23:35.253 --> 01:23:37.244
I missed you too, Dave.

01:23:39.491 --> 01:23:41.186
Me too.

01:23:41.359 --> 01:23:47.355
- So did Alvin. He's too cool to admit it.
- Yeah, too macho.

01:23:48.667 --> 01:23:51.363
Missed you too.

01:23:51.536 --> 01:23:54.437
Sorry, I had some sentimentality
stuck in my throat.

01:23:54.606 --> 01:23:58.702
I just said, I missed you too.

01:23:58.877 --> 01:24:00.845
Whatever.
Who are you guys to judge me?

01:24:01.012 --> 01:24:04.243
Okay, you know what?
I miss my friend Dave, okay?

01:24:04.416 --> 01:24:08.716
I'll scream it from the rooftops.
And I'm not afraid. I'm not ashamed.

01:24:08.887 --> 01:24:12.050
That's right. I love you, Dave.

01:24:14.626 --> 01:24:15.752
Come here.

01:24:19.564 --> 01:24:21.589
- Dave?
- Yes, Alvin?

01:24:21.766 --> 01:24:24.428
Now can I steer?
Oh, please, please, please.

01:24:24.603 --> 01:24:28.130
- I want to work the windshield wipers.
- Oh, and I'd like to beep the horn.

01:24:28.306 --> 01:24:30.536
Have at it, fellas.

01:24:31.776 --> 01:24:34.438
- I'm a good beeper.
- Save some horn for the rest of us.

01:24:34.613 --> 01:24:37.741
- Come on, Dave, drive faster.
- Not with you steering.

01:24:37.916 --> 01:24:40.077
Dave, you drive like a sleepy old bear.

01:24:40.252 --> 01:24:43.244
- Okay, Alvin, that's enough.
- Enough of what? Of being awesome?

01:24:43.421 --> 01:24:44.752
Alvin, I said that's enough.

01:24:44.923 --> 01:24:47.448
Hey, look, Dave, no paws.

01:24:49.594 --> 01:24:55.089
Hey, if you guys behave, maybe
I'll let you call me "Uncle Ian" again.

01:24:55.267 --> 01:24:56.825
Deal?

01:25:16.922 --> 01:25:23.623
No!

01:25:30.835 --> 01:25:32.359
Claire.

01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:33.628
- Hey.
- Come on in.

01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:38.006
- Hi, Claire.
- Well, hello, Clarina.

01:25:38.176 --> 01:25:40.167
- Hi, guys.
- Hope you like toaster waffles.

01:25:40.578 --> 01:25:44.480
And, for us classy chipmunks,
a bit of the bubbly.

01:25:45.483 --> 01:25:48.475
Stupid cork. Doesn't...

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.094
I'm not gonna say it.

01:25:58.663 --> 01:25:59.721
Good grief.

01:26:01.466 --> 01:26:03.491
Are you still not gonna say it?

01:26:03.668 --> 01:26:04.828
Nope.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:15.070
I'm gonna say it. Alvin!

01:26:15.246 --> 01:26:17.111
Okay!

01:26:30.929 --> 01:26:33.227
Okay, guys, come on,
let's try it again.

01:26:33.398 --> 01:26:36.026
Here we go, and sing.

01:26:36.201 --> 01:26:41.002
Come on, sing for your uncle Ian.
Come on, sing.

01:26:41.172 --> 01:26:43.766
Why...? Why won't you sing?

01:26:43.942 --> 01:26:46.342
You know, I said, sing.

01:26:46.511 --> 01:26:48.536
Sing.

01:31:11.042 --> 01:31:13.033
