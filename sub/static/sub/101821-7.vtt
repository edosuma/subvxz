<i>Hey, what are you doing here?</i>

00:08.591 --> 00:10.427
<i>You didn't even watch</i>
last week's <i>Shameless.</i>

00:10.468 --> 00:12.220
<i>Get the fuck out of my truck.</i>

00:12.262 --> 00:13.888
<i>[Carl]</i> <i>Something weird</i>
happened with Tish.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.182
<i>She didn't wanna use a condom,</i>
but I did.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.726
<i>I tried to pull out,</i>
but she wrapped her legs

00:17.767 --> 00:19.269
<i>so tight</i>
and wouldn't let me.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.479
<i>She raped you.</i>

00:21.521 --> 00:22.981
<i>Are we in a relationship?</i>

00:23.023 --> 00:24.607
<i>[Royal]</i> <i>Sandy!</i>

00:24.649 --> 00:25.483
<i>Who's that?</i>

00:25.525 --> 00:27.110
<i>It's my fucking husband.</i>

00:27.152 --> 00:28.111
<i>Your what?</i>

00:28.153 --> 00:30.030
<i>Now all I gotta do</i>
is get Black folks

00:30.071 --> 00:31.448
<i>moving back</i>
into the neighborhood.

00:31.489 --> 00:32.699
<i>Black folks</i>
don't shoot up schools.

<i>When Mikaela has</i>
a problem with Laquon,

00:34.367 --> 00:35.785
<i>she knows she gotta go</i>
to his mama's house,

00:35.827 --> 00:36.995
<i>handle it there.</i>

00:37.037 --> 00:38.371
<i>We can stash the bikes in here</i>
till you find some buyers.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.040
<i>You're cool letting us use</i>
your gym?

00:40.081 --> 00:40.957
<i>How much?</i>

00:40.999 --> 00:41.875
<i>Five percent.</i>

00:41.916 --> 00:43.084
<i>Deal.</i>

00:43.126 --> 00:44.461
<i>I saw my dad yesterday.</i>

00:44.502 --> 00:48.465
<i>I told him about us maybe</i>
taking over my old bedroom.

00:48.506 --> 00:50.050
<i>No, no, no, absolutely not.</i>

00:50.091 --> 00:52.719
<i>We're, uh...we're thinking</i>
we wanna sell the house,

00:52.761 --> 00:54.429
<i>the Gallagher house.</i>

00:54.471 --> 00:55.597
<i>Fuck that.</i>

00:55.638 --> 00:57.515
A woman found you
unconscious

00:57.557 --> 00:59.350

<i>Know that</i>
it's not for naught

01:28.338 --> 01:31.424
<i>You were beaming</i>
once before

01:31.466 --> 01:35.929
<i>But it's not like that</i>
anymore

01:35.970 --> 01:39.390
<i>What is this downside</i>

01:39.432 --> 01:42.811
<i>That you speak of?</i>

01:42.852 --> 01:44.771
<i>What is this feeling</i>

01:44.813 --> 01:49.901
<i>You're so sure of?</i>

01:56.032 --> 01:59.786
<i>Round up</i>
the friends you got

01:59.828 --> 02:02.789
<i>Know that</i>

02:02.831 --> 02:05.834
<i>You were willing</i>

<i>You're so sure of?</i>

02:27.730 --> 02:29.482
<i>Good morning,</i>
oh brother of mine.

02:29.524 --> 02:30.733
<i>Made you breakfast.</i>

02:30.775 --> 02:32.652
<i>-[humming]</i>
-What's with her?

02:32.694 --> 02:34.654
<i>I wouldn't trust it.</i>

<i>upbeat rock music</i>

02:36.656 --> 02:38.074
<i>Good morning, boys.</i>

02:38.116 --> 02:40.410
<i>Look what I made.</i>

02:40.451 --> 02:41.494
<i>Your favorite.</i>

02:41.536 --> 02:44.664
<i>Why the fuck are you</i>
touching me right now?

02:44.706 --> 02:47.208
<i>Tami, Phillip,</i>
bacon rainbows?

02:47.250 --> 02:48.042
<i>Flower pancakes?</i>

02:48.084 --> 02:49.878
Uh, we're good.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.630
<i>Uh, good.</i>
Thanks, though.

02:52.672 --> 02:53.631
<i>Hey, bud.</i>

02:56.885 --> 02:58.303
<i>So, um...</i>

02:58.344 --> 03:00.388
<i>things got a little bit heated</i>
last night,

03:00.430 --> 03:01.931
<i>but now that</i>
we've all slept on it,

03:01.973 --> 03:03.641
<i>I would like to reopen</i>
the discussion

03:03.683 --> 03:06.144
<i>about fixing up the house</i>
to sell.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.189
<i>Um...</i>

03:09.230 --> 03:11.691
<i>if we knocked out</i>
a couple walls,

03:11.733 --> 03:13.109
<i>created a more open floor plan,</i>

03:13.151 --> 03:15.570
<i>we could add 30 grand</i>
to the sale price.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.539
<i>[sighs]</i>
Debs, what do you think?

03:26.581 --> 03:29.876
<i>Oh, Phillip...</i>
Well, I think

03:29.918 --> 03:31.085
<i>you can take</i>
your open floor plan

03:31.127 --> 03:32.503
<i>-and lick my vagina.</i>
Gross.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.339
<i>Jesus fucking Christ,</i>
what is the big deal?

03:34.380 --> 03:35.590
<i>I grew up here.</i>

03:35.632 --> 03:36.633
<i>Yeah, we all grew up here.</i>

03:36.674 --> 03:37.842
<i>Maybe our kids can grow up</i>
someplace nicer.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.094
<i>Yeah, maybe somewhere</i>
Frank doesn't live.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.555
<i>Oh, I see what this is.</i>

03:42.597 --> 03:44.182
<i>It's not even your idea.</i>

03:44.224 --> 03:45.975
<i>Fucking</i>
Little Miss Middle Class

03:46.017 --> 03:47.185
<i>wants her townhouse in Pilsen.</i>

03:47.227 --> 03:48.436
<i>Whoa, hold on a second.</i>
I didn't even--

03:48.478 --> 03:50.146
<i>How hard did you have</i>
to twist his little nut sack

03:50.188 --> 03:51.231
<i>for him to do what you wanted?</i>

03:51.272 --> 03:52.523
Nobody twisted
my nut sack, all right?

03:52.565 --> 03:53.816
<i>And it doesn't matter</i>
whose idea this is.

03:53.858 --> 03:54.817
<i>It's a good idea.</i>

03:54.859 --> 03:56.027
<i>You are the only one</i>
who doesn't think so.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.987
<i>Well, Ian only thinks so</i>
because you think so.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.697
<i>-What?</i>
-And Carl's too stupid to think

03:59.739 --> 04:01.115
<i>-anything at all.</i>
-Hey, that's not true.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.867
<i>Mickey and I have been</i>
saving up to get our own place.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.328
<i>When did that idea come?</i>
Right when Lip moved out.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.163
<i>"Lip got his own place.</i>
I should too."

04:07.205 --> 04:08.081
<i>That's bullshit.</i>

04:08.122 --> 04:09.624
<i>I don't just do things</i>
'cause Lip says.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.792
<i>Well, you sort of do, though.</i>

04:11.709 --> 04:12.752
<i>Name one thing.</i>

04:12.794 --> 04:14.796
<i>Switched from tighty-whiteys</i>
to boxers 'cause Lip did.

04:14.837 --> 04:17.340
<i>I had a fungus issue.</i>
Boxers air the boys out better.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.550
<i>Totally.</i>
Who told you that again?

04:19.592 --> 04:20.885
<i>Lip.</i>
Fuck the both of you.

04:20.927 --> 04:21.844
<i>I'm my own man.</i>

04:21.886 --> 04:23.304
<i>Okay, big shot.</i>
Why don't you tell Lip

04:23.346 --> 04:24.430
<i>you don't wanna sell</i>
the house, then?

04:24.472 --> 04:26.140
<i>Mickey, hey, stop.</i>
Family only.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.058
<i>Mickey's family.</i>

04:27.100 --> 04:28.059
<i>Yeah, well, he's just saying--</i>

04:28.101 --> 04:29.143
<i>This doesn't concern you, Tami.</i>

04:29.185 --> 04:30.270
<i>Yeah, none of this</i>
concerns you, Tami.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.813
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>
So Mickey's family,

04:31.854 --> 04:33.147
<i>but Tami's not family?</i>

04:33.189 --> 04:34.274
<i>Yeah.</i>
They're married.

04:34.315 --> 04:35.942
<i>Tami has no right to tell you</i>
to sell my house.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.235
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
I didn't tell him

04:37.277 --> 04:38.194
<i>to do anything.</i>

04:38.236 --> 04:39.737
<i>-What the fuck?</i>
-All right, back off.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.115
<i>All right?</i>
I got this.

04:42.156 --> 04:43.866
<i>Wow.</i>

04:43.908 --> 04:46.703
<i>Carl, we sell,</i>
we each get 20 grand.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.246
<i>Right?</i>
Maybe more, okay?

04:48.288 --> 04:49.956
<i>You could get</i>
a sick bachelor pad for that.

04:49.998 --> 04:50.873
<i>Awesome.</i>

04:50.915 --> 04:51.958
<i>You're gonna have to clean</i>
that bachelor pad

04:52.000 --> 04:53.543
<i>-and cook your own meals.</i>
-Shit.

04:53.584 --> 04:54.836
You'll be able
to have sex

04:54.877 --> 04:56.337
<i>without someone barging in</i>
and asking for deodorant.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.464
But you'll have to pay
your own bills.

04:58.506 --> 04:59.966
<i>Look, you can do that online.</i>
It's easy.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.718
<i>Carl doesn't know which remote</i>
turns the TV on.

05:01.759 --> 05:03.177
<i>You think he can pay</i>
his own bills online?

05:03.219 --> 05:04.554
<i>Debbie, you can't just insult</i>
your way

05:04.595 --> 05:05.430
<i>into getting what you want.</i>

05:05.471 --> 05:06.514
<i>And you can't fuck your way</i>

05:06.556 --> 05:07.682
<i>into getting</i>
what you want, Tami!

05:07.724 --> 05:08.808
<i></i>

05:08.850 --> 05:09.934
<i>The fuck is so funny?</i>

05:09.976 --> 05:12.562
<i>I mean, why do you all</i>
still live together?

05:12.603 --> 05:13.938
<i>You obviously hate each other.</i>

05:13.980 --> 05:15.690
<i>-We don't hate each other.</i>
-We don't all hate each other.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.734
<i>-We just all hate Debbie.</i>

05:17.775 --> 05:20.320
<i>Hey, Ian doesn't hate Lip.</i>
Ian loves Lip.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.821
<i>Lip is his only friend</i>
in the whole fucking world.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.114
<i>Oh, fuck you, Debbie.</i>

05:23.156 --> 05:24.324
<i>-She's not wrong, though.</i>
-All right, could we all

05:24.365 --> 05:26.200
<i>just put</i>
our personal shit aside,

05:26.242 --> 05:27.535
<i>right, calm the fuck down,</i>

05:27.577 --> 05:29.370
<i>and just have</i>
a rational discussion for once?

05:29.412 --> 05:30.496
We have to pay
for water?

05:30.538 --> 05:31.622
<i>[Debbie]</i>
Yes, water costs money.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.666
<i>Okay, how about we don't</i>
calm the fuck down,

05:33.708 --> 05:35.293
<i>and we get up in Debbie's face,</i>

05:35.335 --> 05:36.419
<i>and we call her out</i>
for being

05:36.461 --> 05:37.962
<i>the selfish brat that she is?</i>

05:38.004 --> 05:40.006
<i>-You cut hair, Tami.</i>
-Tami, Tami, not helping.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.424
<i>If Lip told you to lick</i>
a cat turd

05:41.466 --> 05:42.592
<i>off a steam pipe</i>
in the middle of July--

05:42.633 --> 05:43.760
<i>Yeah, I got something here</i>
to lick on.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.219
<i>Nobody's licking any turds!</i>
All right?

05:45.261 --> 05:46.929
<i>I could get a maid, right?</i>
I don't wanna have to clean

05:46.971 --> 05:47.930
<i>the shit out of my own toilet.</i>

05:47.972 --> 05:49.015
A maid's
not gonna cook for you.

05:49.057 --> 05:49.849
<i>You're gonna starve.</i>

05:49.891 --> 05:51.601
<i>Okay, okay,</i>
okay, okay, okay!

05:51.642 --> 05:53.936
<i>Everybody shut the fuck up,</i>
please.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.522
<i>Let's just vote</i>
and be done with it.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.690
<i>Sell!</i>

05:57.732 --> 05:59.400
<i>-Shut up, Franny!</i>
Atta girl.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.818
<i>Nice mothering, Debbie.</i>

06:00.860 --> 06:02.862
<i>Stop, all right?</i>
Tami, Mickey,

06:02.904 --> 06:06.115
<i>stay out of it.</i>
Franny, you too.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.533
<i>I vote sell.</i>

06:07.575 --> 06:09.035
<i>I vote no.</i>

06:09.077 --> 06:10.453
<i>Ian.</i>

06:15.458 --> 06:16.459
<i>I vote no.</i>

06:16.501 --> 06:17.585
<i>Yes.</i>
Gallaghers, unite.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.586
<i>You fucking kidding me?</i>

06:18.628 --> 06:20.838
<i>Oh, shut up.</i>
Carl?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.048
<i>Can I think about it?</i>

06:22.090 --> 06:25.218
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Right now, decision.

06:25.259 --> 06:28.096
<i>Liam.</i>

06:28.137 --> 06:31.099
<i>Where the fuck is Liam?</i>

06:32.350 --> 06:34.602
<i>Mm, don't you look beautiful!</i>

06:34.644 --> 06:36.270
<i>No, sir.</i>
You let Lip hide

06:36.312 --> 06:37.939
<i>stolen motorcycles in Kev-Fit.</i>

06:37.980 --> 06:40.108
<i>You and I don't have anything</i>
to say to each other

06:40.149 --> 06:41.025
<i>until this is over.</i>

06:41.067 --> 06:42.693
<i>It's only for a couple of days!</i>

06:42.735 --> 06:44.153
<i>Did you see that chopper?</i>

06:44.195 --> 06:45.405
<i>I've always wanted</i>
a chopper like that.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.323
<i>I'd be ten times more fuckable</i>
in a chopper.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.243
<i>If you get on that chopper,</i>
you're never gonna get...

06:50.284 --> 06:51.327
fucked again.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.578
<i>Brad's got a buyer in Indiana.</i>

06:52.620 --> 06:54.831
<i>Him and Lip are running</i>
two of them there today.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.916
<i>Get rid of them.</i>
All of them.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.668
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>
Girls, you ready

06:58.709 --> 06:59.710
<i>to go to school?</i>

06:59.752 --> 07:02.588
<i>[Veronica]</i>
Where the hell are they going?

07:02.630 --> 07:03.881
<i>Girls?</i>

07:03.923 --> 07:05.758
<i>Who's in there?</i>

07:07.969 --> 07:09.887
<i>-Liam?</i>
-Hi.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.597
<i>-Christ, Liam!</i>
-What are you doing here?

07:11.639 --> 07:13.266
<i>Lip's selling the house.</i>

07:13.307 --> 07:14.934
<i>-Lip's selling the house?</i>
-What?

07:14.976 --> 07:16.561
<i>Everyone's moving on</i>
with their lives,

07:16.602 --> 07:18.229
<i>and I'm gonna end up homeless.</i>

07:18.271 --> 07:20.898
<i>Can I live with you?</i>

07:20.940 --> 07:22.400
<i>-You got this?</i>
-Yeah, I got it.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.734
<i>All right, cool.</i>
Girls, let's go.

07:23.776 --> 07:27.029
<i>Come on.</i>
I gotta go sign in voters.

07:27.071 --> 07:28.072
<i>It's election day.</i>

07:28.114 --> 07:30.366
<i>But in the meantime,</i>
you and I are gonna talk

07:30.408 --> 07:32.702
<i>about why young Black men</i>
can't go around

07:32.743 --> 07:34.620
<i>breaking into people's houses.</i>

07:34.662 --> 07:36.914
<i>Come on.</i>

07:37.748 --> 07:39.834
<i>A Gallagher has lived</i>
in that house

07:39.876 --> 07:42.545
<i>since before statehood.</i>

07:42.587 --> 07:46.132
<i>My great-great-great</i>
grandfather Connell

07:46.174 --> 07:49.760
<i>built it on the foundation</i>

07:54.474 --> 07:55.933
<i>I should have...</i>

for those beers?

08:12.325 --> 08:13.367
<i>Just put it on my tab.</i>

08:13.409 --> 08:15.203
You don't

<i>Um...</i>

08:20.041 --> 08:22.084

<i>Don't care if you drink them</i>

I'd give it a minute.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.311

-Apartments.

<i>-we should probably have a--</i>
Sell?

09:25.064 --> 09:26.649
<i>You just dared me</i>

-No.

<i>I change my vote,</i>
Debbie thinks she's right,

09:35.199 --> 09:37.994
<i>and I promised to never let</i>
Debbie think she's right.

<i>Damn, man, you do need</i>
friends who aren't Lip.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.750
I have friends
who aren't Lip.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.043
<i>Uh-huh?</i>
Like who?

09:46.085 --> 09:47.336
<i>-Don't say me.</i>
You.

09:47.378 --> 09:48.588
<i>All right, what friends</i>
have you got?

09:48.629 --> 09:49.672
<i>-Don't say me.</i>
You.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.215
<i>See?</i>
Neither of us have friends.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.633
<i>Yeah, but as far</i>
as I'm concerned,

09:52.675 --> 09:54.051
<i>a friend is just someone else</i>
I gotta shoot

09:54.093 --> 09:55.344
<i>before they turn</i>

<i>Yeah, well, if I need friends,</i>

09:56.721 --> 09:57.930
<i>you need friends.</i>

09:57.972 --> 09:58.848
<i>Why?</i>

09:58.889 --> 10:00.141
<i>You really want me hanging out</i>
by myself

10:00.182 --> 10:02.602
<i>with a bunch of gay guys,</i>
talking about sex and stuff?

10:02.643 --> 10:03.519
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

10:03.561 --> 10:04.437
<i>That's what friends do.</i>

10:04.478 --> 10:05.855
<i>Fuck you.</i>
Make friends with chicks.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.898
<i>Yeah, 'cause chicks wanna hear</i>
about our sex life.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.525
<i>Why do you wanna be talking</i>
to everybody

10:09.567 --> 10:10.610
<i>about our fucking sex lives?</i>

10:10.651 --> 10:12.445
<i>I don't.</i>
But say I wanted to bitch

10:12.486 --> 10:14.155
<i>about you not liking</i>
having your ass licked.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.364
Oh, Christ.
This again.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.407
<i>I can't do that with a bunch</i>

10:16.449 --> 10:17.491
<i>of straight guys or with girls.</i>

10:17.533 --> 10:18.659
<i>I can only do that</i>
with gay guys.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.077
<i>You already have some,</i>
don't you?

10:20.119 --> 10:21.245
<i>You got a group of gay friends</i>

10:21.287 --> 10:22.288
<i>who know I don't</i>
like getting my ass licked,

<i>and now I gotta</i>
go fucking murder

<i>a bunch of people.</i>

10:24.915 --> 10:26.375
<i>No, but if I make gay friends,</i>

10:26.417 --> 10:28.169
<i>we're gonna talk about sex,</i>

10:28.210 --> 10:29.962
<i>and if you're not there,</i>

10:30.004 --> 10:31.505
<i>who knows what'll happen?</i>

10:31.547 --> 10:33.841
<i>Oh, really?</i>

10:33.883 --> 10:35.593
<i>Remember the whole monogamy</i>
conversation we had?

10:35.635 --> 10:36.636
<i>What'd we decide?</i>

10:36.677 --> 10:38.346
<i>We can hump other people</i>
when we're together,

10:38.387 --> 10:39.513
<i>not when we're on our own.</i>

10:39.555 --> 10:41.474
<i>Then I guess we should make</i>
some friends together.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.684
<i>Fuck, man,</i>
I hate the fucking gays.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.520
<i>All their "meh"</i>
and their "bleh."

10:46.562 --> 10:47.730
<i>They're not all like that.</i>

10:47.772 --> 10:49.690
<i>Okay, well, let's find some</i>
who aren't like that.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.067
<i>Where do we find those gays?</i>

10:51.108 --> 10:52.485
<i>I don't know.</i>

10:52.526 --> 10:54.820
<i>Furniture shopping?</i>
The gym.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.238
<i>Fancy places have</i>
free trial weeks.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.949
<i>All right, great, so we find</i>
some fucking fancy gays

10:58.991 --> 11:00.826
<i>at the gym.</i>
Then what?

11:00.868 --> 11:01.744
<i>Smile?</i>

11:01.786 --> 11:02.745
<i>Talk to them?</i>

11:02.787 --> 11:05.206
<i>Jesus Christ,</i>
I gotta smile now too?

11:05.247 --> 11:06.415
<i>You seemed pretty happy</i>

11:06.457 --> 11:10.461
<i>with how I woke you up</i>

<i>Gonna go talk</i>

11:37.405 --> 11:38.614
<i>like dinner or something?</i>

11:38.656 --> 11:40.324
<i>Uh, look, I don't think</i>

11:40.366 --> 11:43.035
<i>we should be seeing</i>
each other anymore.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.287
<i>Okay.</i>
Uh...

11:45.329 --> 11:48.040
<i>W-wait, I-I thought that...</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

12:00.386 --> 12:03.222
<i>Shh, there you go.</i>
Shh.

<i>Yeah.</i>

12:04.348 --> 12:06.142
<i>Yeah, all right, great.</i>
Yeah, I'll see you in an hour.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.768
<i>A'ight, bye.</i>

12:07.810 --> 12:09.019
<i>Hey.</i>

12:09.061 --> 12:10.771
<i>Brad found a buyer</i>

12:10.813 --> 12:11.814
<i>for the bikes in Merrillville,</i>

12:11.856 --> 12:13.399
<i>so I'm gonna go pick them up</i>
from Kev's

12:13.441 --> 12:15.109
<i>-and run them down.</i>
-Great.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.944
<i>I will start packing up</i>
some of our stuff

12:16.986 --> 12:19.155
<i>and bringing it over</i>
to my dad's.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.656
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
What?

12:20.698 --> 12:21.866
<i>Well, I mean,</i>
we have to be out of here

12:21.907 --> 12:22.867
<i>in a few weeks.</i>

12:22.908 --> 12:24.535
<i>Doesn't look like you're</i>
selling your old house

12:24.577 --> 12:25.953
<i>-anytime soon.</i>
Uh-huh.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.830
<i>We can't afford a new place,</i>
so...

12:27.872 --> 12:29.582
<i>I thought that we</i>
would stay with my dad

12:29.623 --> 12:30.791
<i>just until we figure things</i>
out.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.501
<i>Oh, I've got things</i>
figured out, though, right?

12:32.543 --> 12:34.503
<i>I'm gonna get Liam and Carl</i>
on my side,

12:34.545 --> 12:35.463
<i>we're gonna sell the house,</i>

12:35.504 --> 12:37.381
<i>and we can use our cuts</i>

12:37.423 --> 12:38.466
<i>to get a new place.</i>

12:38.507 --> 12:42.386
<i>Okay, but even if Debbie</i>
let that happen,

12:42.428 --> 12:44.096
<i>we're talking about remodeling.</i>

12:44.138 --> 12:45.139
<i>You know?</i>

12:45.181 --> 12:46.849
<i>That's gonna take a while.</i>

12:46.891 --> 12:48.058
<i>Well, I'm gonna sell</i>
the Indian,

12:48.100 --> 12:49.977
<i>and that'll get us enough</i>
to rent an apartment

12:50.019 --> 12:50.811
<i>in the meantime.</i>

12:50.853 --> 12:52.438
<i>Lip.</i>
"Sell the house."

12:52.480 --> 12:53.272
<i>"Sell the Indian."</i>

12:53.314 --> 12:55.274
<i>How about just get a job?</i>

12:55.316 --> 12:56.317
<i>You know?</i>

12:56.358 --> 12:57.902
<i>-Amazon is hiring drivers.</i>
-No, no.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.029
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>
I've got applications in,

13:00.070 --> 13:02.490
<i>all right, for mechanic jobs</i>
all over town.

13:02.531 --> 13:05.451
<i>That's great, but, like,</i>
until you get one of those,

13:05.493 --> 13:07.369
<i>how about deliver packages</i>

13:07.411 --> 13:08.579
<i>or flip burgers?</i>

13:08.621 --> 13:11.123
<i>And we can stay with my family,</i>
save up for a new place

13:11.165 --> 13:12.041
<i>like normal people.</i>

13:12.082 --> 13:14.084
<i>No, I'm not living</i>
with your family.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.336
<i>Okay?</i>
W-with your dad

13:15.377 --> 13:16.420
<i>and his Fox News</i>

<i>and-and-and Cami</i>

13:19.131 --> 13:20.090
<i>fucking Cami-ness.</i>

13:20.132 --> 13:21.842
<i>Oh, what, you think</i>
your family's any better?

13:21.884 --> 13:23.803
<i>C-come on, you guys have</i>
a criminal record

13:23.844 --> 13:25.095
<i>longer than the Gambinos'.</i>

13:25.137 --> 13:27.264
<i>Look, it would be easier</i>

13:27.306 --> 13:29.308
<i>to fix up my old house</i>
if we were in it.

13:29.350 --> 13:32.561
<i>Well, Debbie...</i>
called me a controlling bitch,

13:32.603 --> 13:34.438
<i>so we are not staying there.</i>

13:34.480 --> 13:36.524
<i>Thank you for defending me,</i>
by the way.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.901
<i>You don't think you're being</i>
a little controlling right now?

13:38.943 --> 13:40.903
<i>I...I have a plan.</i>

13:40.945 --> 13:42.071
<i>-Okay?</i>
-Yeah, but it's based on things

13:42.112 --> 13:44.031
<i>that are not in your control.</i>

13:44.073 --> 13:45.241
<i>Okay?</i>
With my plan,

13:45.282 --> 13:48.035
<i>we have a place to stay.</i>
We have actual income.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.204
All right, wait.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.581
<i>Just give me the day,</i>
all right?

13:52.623 --> 13:54.333
<i>Let me work on Liam and Carl.</i>

13:54.375 --> 13:55.918
<i>Let me sell the Indian,</i>
all right?

13:55.960 --> 13:57.044
<i>If it doesn't work out,</i>

13:57.086 --> 13:58.671
<i>then we will talk</i>
about what happens next.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.298
<i>Just one day, okay?</i>

14:03.551 --> 14:05.219
<i>Fine.</i>

14:05.261 --> 14:06.178
<i>One day.</i>

14:06.220 --> 14:07.221
<i>Okay.</i>
Hey.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.430
<i>It'll work out, all right?</i>

14:08.472 --> 14:09.557
<i>I promise you.</i>

<i>Hey, Brad.</i>
Uh, yeah.

<i>You think you can, uh,</i>
find someone

14:20.317 --> 14:22.361
<i>who would wanna buy</i>
the Indian too?

15:49.531 --> 15:51.867
I don't get it.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.119
<i>I say sell this shithole</i>
like Lip wants,

15:54.161 --> 15:56.163
<i>get a Thunderbird,</i>
and let's Thelma and Louise

15:56.205 --> 15:57.539
<i>our asses to Mexico.</i>

15:57.581 --> 15:59.333
<i>It's not just Lip's decision.</i>

15:59.375 --> 16:01.335
<i>We make decisions as a family.</i>

16:01.377 --> 16:02.962
If you weren't beholden
to your family,

16:03.003 --> 16:04.797
<i>you'd have way more fun.</i>

16:04.838 --> 16:06.507
<i>Yeah, well,</i>
I'd still have Franny.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.926
<i>People with kids</i>
don't get to have fun.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.469
<i>[Royal]</i> <i>Sandy!</i>

16:10.511 --> 16:11.804
<i>Sandy!</i>

16:11.845 --> 16:13.097
<i>Oh, that's fucking Royal.</i>

16:13.138 --> 16:14.431
<i>[Royal]</i> <i>Sandy!</i>

16:14.473 --> 16:15.307
<i>Fuck that noise.</i>

16:15.349 --> 16:16.850
<i>Wait, no.</i>
Debbie.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.644
<i>No, no, no, no,</i>
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.229
<i>No, no, no, don't.</i>
No, no, no.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.981
<i>-No, Debbie, stop.</i>
-[Royal] <i>Sandy!</i>

16:23.023 --> 16:25.818
<i>Oh-ho, Royal,</i>
you fucking pervert.

16:25.859 --> 16:27.236
<i>You can't just force</i>

16:27.277 --> 16:28.529
<i>a 15-year-old girl</i>
to marry you...

16:28.570 --> 16:29.488
<i>Force her?</i>
I didn't force her--

16:29.530 --> 16:30.531
<i>...and then stalk her</i>

16:30.572 --> 16:31.949
<i>for the rest</i>
of your fucking life.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.242
<i>-Now get the fuck out of here.</i>
-No, Debbie, Debbie, stop it.

16:33.283 --> 16:34.702
<i>Stop it.</i>
What...what are you doing here?

16:34.743 --> 16:37.079
<i>I'm sorry, but you weren't</i>
answering your phone.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.831
<i>They cut my hours at Verizon,</i>

16:38.872 --> 16:41.333
<i>so I picked up a job</i>
at Pizzeria Uno.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.210
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Why is that her problem?

16:43.252 --> 16:45.587
<i>Because someone</i>
needs to watch Prince.

16:45.629 --> 16:48.507
<i>Who's Prince?</i>

16:48.549 --> 16:50.175
Come on, bud.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.178
<i>Hey.</i>
There you go.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.221
<i>No.</i>

16:54.263 --> 16:55.305
<i>My mom's in the hospital</i>

16:55.347 --> 16:56.557
<i>with another popped</i>
stomach staple.

16:56.598 --> 16:58.934
<i>You think I would ask</i>
if I had any other option?

16:58.976 --> 17:01.186
<i>Can you please just be</i>
a mother for five hours?

17:01.228 --> 17:02.730
<i>A mother?</i>
You--

17:02.771 --> 17:04.940
<i>Hey, you stay here with Mommy</i>
and her girlfriend,

17:04.982 --> 17:06.442
<i>and I'll come get you after</i>
Pizzeria Uno, okay, buddy?

17:06.483 --> 17:07.735
<i>No, no, no, no,</i>
no, no, no, no, no.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.737
<i>You can't just leave him here.</i>
What are you doing?

17:09.778 --> 17:10.696
I love you, buddy.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.198
<i>I'm sorry, Sandy.</i>
Five hours.

17:15.826 --> 17:19.079
<i>Oh</i>

17:19.121 --> 17:20.414
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

17:20.456 --> 17:21.915
<i>peppy music</i>

17:21.957 --> 17:23.876
<i>Don't call me that.</i>

17:23.917 --> 17:25.836
Hey, Sandy!

17:25.878 --> 17:27.337
<i>Come.</i>

17:30.507 --> 17:32.009
<i>Hey</i>

17:37.264 --> 17:38.599
<i>Shit.</i>

17:43.562 --> 17:46.607
<i>Can you change a twenty?</i>

17:46.648 --> 17:48.859
<i>That's a candy bar wrapper.</i>

17:48.901 --> 17:51.111
<i>Oh, will you look at that?</i>
I'm sorry.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.697
<i>I was just diagnosed</i>
with dementia.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.616
<i>I must've picked up</i>
the candy bar wrapper

17:55.657 --> 17:58.410
<i>on my dresser</i>
instead of my wa--

17:59.870 --> 18:02.289
<i>Bless you.</i>

18:02.331 --> 18:04.458
<i>Sucker.</i>

18:04.500 --> 18:06.376
<i>Gina!</i>
How are you?

18:06.418 --> 18:07.419
<i>You look wonderful.</i>

18:07.461 --> 18:08.378
<i>Bitch, I don't know you!</i>

18:08.420 --> 18:09.630
<i>You're not...</i>
I'm so sorry.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.715
<i>I thought you were</i>
my friend Gina, and...and I--

18:11.757 --> 18:12.800
<i>Fuck you, old man.</i>

18:12.841 --> 18:16.220
<i>I'm ...m sorry.</i>
I'm...

18:18.347 --> 18:21.225
<i>[bus PA]</i> <i>Via Wacker.</i>

18:21.266 --> 18:24.603
<i>Thank you, Danica.</i>

18:25.604 --> 18:26.855
<i>Excellent.</i>

18:26.897 --> 18:29.900
<i>upbeat rock music</i>

18:38.200 --> 18:41.620
Shit, shit, fuck,
shit, fuck, shit, fuck.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.208
<i>Hello, Officer.</i>
Kevin Ball,

18:46.250 --> 18:48.293
<i>upstanding taxpayer</i>
and father of two.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.504
<i>-This your chopper?</i>
-Yes...no.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.172
<i>No, it's, uh, my friend's.</i>

18:52.214 --> 18:54.341
<i>I'm just taking it for a spin</i>
on the way to work.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.468
<i>You own Kev-Fit?</i>

18:56.510 --> 18:58.887
<i>Hmm?</i>

18:58.929 --> 19:01.473
<i>Yes, yes.</i>
I own Kev-Fit.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.433
<i>Where'd your friend</i>
get this bike?

19:03.475 --> 19:04.935
<i>I don't know,</i>

19:04.977 --> 19:06.812
<i>but I'm sure he got it legally.</i>

19:06.854 --> 19:08.981
<i>Think he'd be willing</i>
to sell it?

19:09.022 --> 19:12.818
<i>I've been looking</i>
for a '48 Panhead for years.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.487
<i>1,200 CCs,</i>
butterfly carburetor,

19:15.529 --> 19:17.030
<i>springer-raked fork...</i>

19:17.072 --> 19:18.240
Totally chopped.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.992
<i>[laughs]</i>
Right, Officer.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.076
<i>You know your bikes.</i>

19:21.118 --> 19:22.536
<i>But I don't think</i>
this one's for sale.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.996
Ask your friend.

19:24.037 --> 19:26.999
<i>I can come by Kev-Fit</i>
later today.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.667
<i>Why don't I, uh,</i>
get your number,

19:28.709 --> 19:30.919
<i>and I can call you</i>
to see if he's interested?

19:30.961 --> 19:32.671
<i>Cops don't give out</i>
our personal info.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.840
<i>Kev-Fit's on my way home.</i>
I'll stop by around 4:30.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.341
<i>But I don't think</i>
he's gonna be there.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.343
<i>We close early</i>
if no one shows up to class.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.053
<i>If I don't catch him today,</i>
tell him

19:40.095 --> 19:41.680
<i>I'll find him sooner or later.</i>

19:41.722 --> 19:43.473
<i>-See you at 4:30.</i>
-Okay, Officer.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.558
<i>We'll be there.</i>

19:44.600 --> 19:46.310
<i>Or not.</i>
But maybe.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.478
<i>But we probably won't be there.</i>

19:52.733 --> 19:54.401
<i>Here's your sticker,</i>
Mrs. Meyers.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.528
Hannity-loving
blue-haired old hag.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.780
<i>Don't you dare vote</i>
against my rent control bill,

19:58.822 --> 20:00.157
<i>white lady.</i>

20:00.199 --> 20:02.075
<i>Where are all the Black voters?</i>

20:02.117 --> 20:04.870
<i>It's like a Paula Deen</i>
Tupperware party in here.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.163
<i>[Debbie on phone]</i> <i>Oh,</i>
and by the way, I'm making

20:06.205 --> 20:07.623
<i>Tuna Helper tonight,</i>
your favorite.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.291
<i>Bye.</i>

20:09.333 --> 20:11.210
<i>Now everyone wants to know</i>
how I feel

20:11.251 --> 20:12.628
<i>about selling the house?</i>

20:12.669 --> 20:13.712
<i>They didn't ask how you felt</i>

20:13.754 --> 20:14.713
<i>about selling before?</i>

20:14.755 --> 20:16.715
<i>No.</i>
They barely know I'm alive.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.800
<i>That is not true.</i>
They love you.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.427
<i>But you have got to speak up.</i>

20:20.469 --> 20:21.845
<i>You are a young Black man</i>

20:21.887 --> 20:22.721
<i>in a white, white world.</i>

20:22.763 --> 20:24.306
<i>You need to make</i>
your voice heard

20:24.348 --> 20:26.058
<i>like all</i>
these white folk motherfuckers.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.601
<i>They making their voices heard.</i>

20:27.643 --> 20:29.228
<i>Black people</i>
are not speaking up,

20:29.269 --> 20:31.813
<i>so my rent control measure's</i>
probably gonna tank,

20:31.855 --> 20:33.523
<i>white gentrifiers</i>
will take all the housing,

20:33.565 --> 20:35.359
<i>and the South Side</i>
will be the Gold Coast

20:35.400 --> 20:36.526
<i>before you know it.</i>

20:36.568 --> 20:38.946
<i>Where's my mama?</i>
She always votes.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.620
<i>-Hey, stranger.</i>
-[Veronica] <i>Hey!</i>

20:46.662 --> 20:48.747
<i>-You coming to vote today?</i>
-Oh, that was today?

20:48.789 --> 20:50.374
<i>Yeah.</i>
Get your behind down here.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.501
<i>[Carol]</i> <i>Oh, baby,</i>
I'm not gonna be voting.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.794
<i>I'm packing.</i>

20:53.835 --> 20:54.878
<i>[Veronica]</i> <i>Packing what?</i>

20:54.920 --> 20:55.963
<i>I sold the house.</i>

20:56.004 --> 20:58.715
<i>Dominic and I</i>
are moving to Louisville.

20:58.757 --> 20:59.633
<i>Louisville?</i>

20:59.675 --> 21:00.592
<i>[Carol]</i> <i>Yeah, I told you</i>

21:00.634 --> 21:01.843
<i>I was putting it</i>
on the market.

21:01.885 --> 21:04.137
<i>You know, I'm going</i>
through some of your old stuff,

21:04.179 --> 21:07.099
<i>and, well, I'm not sure</i>
what to give to Goodwill.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.183
<i>How about none of it?</i>

21:08.225 --> 21:09.643
<i>Okay, why don't you</i>
come by later,

21:09.685 --> 21:10.852
<i>and we'll decide together?</i>

21:10.894 --> 21:13.272
<i>All right, sweetie.</i>
Love you.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.614
<i>So why didn't you tell me</i>
you abandoned a kid?

21:22.656 --> 21:25.158
<i>[scoffs]</i>
I didn't abandon a kid.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.994
<i>I left a shitty situation.</i>

21:27.035 --> 21:29.705
<i>Royal seems</i>
like a decent enough guy.

21:29.746 --> 21:31.498
<i>How was that</i>
a shitty situation?

21:31.540 --> 21:33.667
<i>I was 15, pregnant,</i>

21:33.709 --> 21:37.004
<i>and taken in by a 30-year-old</i>
who sells phones.

21:37.045 --> 21:39.965
<i>That doesn't sound</i>
like a shitty situation to you?

21:40.007 --> 21:42.384
<i>Not shitty enough</i>
to abandon a kid.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.845
<i>I was a kid myself, Debbie.</i>

21:47.097 --> 21:49.099
<i>I got bored.</i>

21:49.141 --> 21:50.225
<i>-You got bored...</i>
-Yes.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.643
<i>...so you abandoned a child.</i>

21:51.685 --> 21:53.312
<i>Uh, yeah, I was 15.</i>

21:53.353 --> 21:57.482
<i>I needed to find myself.</i>

21:57.524 --> 22:01.320
<i>Don't you ever wish</i>
you had found yourself?

22:01.361 --> 22:03.405
<i>No.</i>

22:03.447 --> 22:05.907
<i>You never once thought, "Mm,</i>

22:05.949 --> 22:08.744
<i>gee, I wish I wasn't tied down</i>
by Franny

22:08.785 --> 22:10.829
<i>for the last five years</i>
of my life?"

22:10.871 --> 22:11.913
<i>Hell, no.</i>

22:11.955 --> 22:14.166
<i>"I wish I could've left</i>
this house,

22:14.207 --> 22:17.836
<i>like, struck out on my own,</i>
and seen the world"?

22:19.379 --> 22:21.506
<i>No.</i>

22:23.175 --> 22:24.593
<i>Well, I guess you're</i>
a better person

22:24.634 --> 22:26.053
<i>than I am, then.</i>

22:26.094 --> 22:28.180
<i>Yeah, sure sounds like it.</i>

22:28.221 --> 22:30.349
<i>Oh, fuck you,</i>
you judgmental ho.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.059
<i>-Where are you going?</i>
-To work.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.477
<i>What the hell am I supposed</i>
to do with Prince?

22:33.518 --> 22:35.228
<i>I don't know.</i>
Put him on an El

22:35.270 --> 22:36.271
<i>to Pizzeria Uno.</i>

22:36.313 --> 22:39.566
<i>Hey, you cannot just run away</i>
from people, Sandy!

22:42.235 --> 22:44.154
<i>-Shit.</i>

22:44.196 --> 22:46.948
<i>Suit up, motherfucker.</i>

22:46.990 --> 22:48.367
<i>Is that a vagina?</i>

22:48.408 --> 22:49.242
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:49.284 --> 22:51.203
<i>She's also</i>
Sally the SVU Squirrel.

22:51.244 --> 22:52.996
<i>We have young victims</i>
show us on Sally

22:53.038 --> 22:54.373
<i>where they were touched.</i>

22:54.414 --> 22:57.584
<i>Don't worry, we'll put</i>
the skirt on her today.

23:00.087 --> 23:03.382
<i>You mind checking that for me?</i>
Back pocket.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.844
<i>-Says "Shithead number four."</i>

23:07.886 --> 23:09.554
<i>Fucking Debbie trying</i>
to convince me

23:09.596 --> 23:11.640
<i>not to sell our house.</i>

23:11.681 --> 23:12.891
<i>Why would you sell your house?</i>

23:12.933 --> 23:14.309
<i>So I can get</i>
a sick bachelor pad

23:14.351 --> 23:16.061
<i>and not live with my family.</i>

23:16.103 --> 23:17.646
<i>But I do love that house,</i>

23:17.687 --> 23:19.106
<i>and I kind of like</i>
living with my family.

23:19.147 --> 23:22.109
<i>But I got low-level raped</i>
in my man cave in the basement,

23:22.150 --> 23:23.568
<i>and I do I really wanna live</i>
in a place

23:23.610 --> 23:26.113
<i>with traumatic memories</i>
like that?

23:26.154 --> 23:27.697
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
Low-level raped?

23:27.739 --> 23:29.074
<i>I wanted to use a condom,</i>

23:29.116 --> 23:33.787
<i>but this girl mounted my dick</i>
before I could get one on.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.747
<i>Man.</i>

23:35.789 --> 23:37.374
<i>I was at a party once.</i>

23:37.416 --> 23:38.750
<i>A girl took me</i>
into a dark room,

23:38.792 --> 23:40.794
<i>you know, to blow me,</i>

23:40.836 --> 23:42.504
<i>but what I thought</i>
was her mouth

23:42.546 --> 23:44.423
<i>wasn't her mouth.</i>

23:44.464 --> 23:46.842
<i>Nine months later,</i>
she's having my baby,

23:46.883 --> 23:49.052
<i>a month later, we're married,</i>

23:49.094 --> 23:50.720
<i>two years later,</i>
we're divorced,

23:50.762 --> 23:51.930
<i>and now half my paycheck</i>

23:51.972 --> 23:53.640
<i>goes to alimony</i>
and child support,

23:53.682 --> 23:56.101
<i>so now I'm stuck living</i>
with my grandma in Englewood

23:56.143 --> 23:57.853
<i>while my ex-wife</i>
takes it up the pooper

23:57.894 --> 23:59.855

-Take some.

<i>Too hot.</i>
Cop's already seen me on it.

Hey!

<i>You can't just sell</i>

<i>I'm Liam.</i>
I'm practicing

<i>making my voice heard.</i>

28:23.284 --> 28:25.578
<i>When did you up and decide</i>
to move to Louisville?

28:25.620 --> 28:26.579
<i>I've been telling you</i>

28:26.621 --> 28:27.956
<i>that I wanted to move</i>
for years.

28:27.997 --> 28:29.290
<i>You told me</i>
you were gonna give me

<i>a llama for Christmas</i>
when I was four.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.711
<i>I'm still waiting for that</i>
to happen.

28:32.752 --> 28:34.629
<i>Chicago isn't the same anymore.</i>

28:34.671 --> 28:35.839
<i>Black people are moving out</i>

28:35.880 --> 28:38.550
<i>faster than white people were</i>
stealing us out of Africa.

28:38.591 --> 28:42.554
<i>Which is why you need to stay.</i>
We have to fight.

28:42.595 --> 28:44.264
<i>Chicago is our home.</i>

28:44.305 --> 28:47.183
<i>Honey, I'm just getting too old</i>
for this fight.

28:47.225 --> 28:49.060
<i>I'm trying to raise a Black son</i>

<i>He's watching</i>
white people sitcoms on TV

28:55.108 --> 28:57.527
<i>in Crocs.</i>

28:57.569 --> 28:58.862
<i>But Louisville?</i>

28:58.903 --> 29:01.239
<i>Well, your aunts are there,</i>
and their sons,

29:01.281 --> 29:04.117
<i>and husbands...</i>
you know, family.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.410
<i>What am I?</i>

29:05.452 --> 29:08.079
<i>You've only seen me</i>
twice this year,

29:08.121 --> 29:10.331
<i>and we only live</i>
eight blocks apart.

29:10.373 --> 29:13.293
<i>There's a community</i>
in Louisville for me.

29:13.334 --> 29:16.838
<i>Baby, I'm sorry, but it's...</i>
it's just time.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.224
<i>Can't believe</i>
you wouldn't let us

29:28.266 --> 29:29.309
<i>be friends with those guys.</i>

29:29.350 --> 29:31.102
<i>You can't start friendships off</i>
with sex.

29:31.144 --> 29:32.312
<i>It sets a bad precedent.</i>

29:32.353 --> 29:33.396
<i>First, we didn't have sex.</i>

29:33.438 --> 29:34.481
<i>We got hand jobs</i>
in a steam room.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.441
<i>Two, our friendship</i>
started with sex.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.359
<i>If you want me marrying</i>
one of those guys in ten years,

29:38.401 --> 29:40.820
<i>then, yeah, let's go back</i>
and make friends with them.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.447
<i>All right, fine,</i>
no steam room guys.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.199
<i>We can still go back</i>
for handies, though, right?

29:44.240 --> 29:45.283
<i>Definitely.</i>

29:45.325 --> 29:46.409
I said mid-century.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.911
<i>Yes, but which part</i>
of mid-century?

29:47.952 --> 29:49.829
<i>-It's not just a year.</i>
-It doesn't matter.

29:49.871 --> 29:53.416
<i>I said cabernet mauve,</i>
not cotton candy mauve.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.543
<i>-Please, not those guys.</i>
-No.

29:55.585 --> 29:57.337
Just make
a fucking decision.

29:57.378 --> 29:59.798
<i>-Okay!</i>
-Hey, guys?

29:59.839 --> 30:01.633
<i>Darker or lighter duvet?</i>

30:01.674 --> 30:03.760
<i>-What?</i>
-I guess that depends

30:03.802 --> 30:05.345
<i>on what part of mid-century.</i>

30:05.386 --> 30:06.638
<i>Bedspread thing?</i>
Lighter.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.848
<i>Hides the lube stains.</i>
Let's go.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.518
<i>I'm Ian.</i>
This is Mickey.

30:11.559 --> 30:14.020
<i>Tim.</i>
This is Brendan.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.188
<i>-Hey.</i>
-He's right.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.940
<i>Lube has destroyed, like,</i>
six sets of sheets for us.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.358
<i>Well, are you using water-based</i>

30:18.399 --> 30:19.484
<i>-or silicone?</i>

30:19.526 --> 30:20.693
<i>Silicone.</i>

30:20.735 --> 30:21.903
<i>Water-based doesn't stain.</i>

30:21.945 --> 30:23.196
<i>Neither does spit.</i>
Ian.

30:23.238 --> 30:24.614
Ugh,
Joe and Sherman can't go

30:24.656 --> 30:26.282
<i>to Anderson Cooper's</i>
book signing today.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.785
<i>It's just us, Jon, and Travis.</i>

30:28.827 --> 30:30.328
<i>We're free today.</i>

30:30.370 --> 30:32.539
<i>For a book signing?</i>

30:32.580 --> 30:33.665
<i>I don't like books.</i>

30:33.706 --> 30:35.041
We love
Anderson Cooper, though.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.668
<i>We do.</i>
He's great.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.461
<i>Listen, can I talk to you</i>
for a sec?

30:38.503 --> 30:40.129
Who the fuck
is Anderson Cooper?

30:40.171 --> 30:41.714
<i>Who the fuck knows?</i>
But maybe these guys

30:41.756 --> 30:42.549
<i>can be our friends.</i>

30:42.590 --> 30:43.675
<i>Oh, so we can't be friends</i>

30:43.716 --> 30:45.093
<i>with the steam room guys,</i>
but we can be friends

30:45.134 --> 30:47.220
<i>with fucking twinks</i>
buying a duvet?

30:47.262 --> 30:48.721
<i>Do you wanna fuck</i>
either of them?

30:48.763 --> 30:50.306
<i>-No.</i>
-Then yes, we can be friends

30:50.348 --> 30:51.558
<i>with the twinks buying a duvet.</i>

30:51.599 --> 30:52.684
<i>I d-no--</i>

30:52.725 --> 30:54.185
<i>We're in.</i>

30:54.227 --> 30:55.937
<i>Okay.</i>
Great.

30:57.647 --> 30:58.690
Okay.

30:58.731 --> 31:00.233
<i>Smile.</i>

31:01.484 --> 31:05.530
And that is how Teddy
got abducted and murdered,

31:05.572 --> 31:06.489
<i>kids.</i>

31:06.531 --> 31:09.534
<i>Now, do we ever take rides</i>
with strangers?

31:09.576 --> 31:11.119
No!

31:11.160 --> 31:13.371
<i>That's right.</i>
Now, Sally

31:13.413 --> 31:14.539
<i>is gonna teach you</i>
the difference

31:14.581 --> 31:16.040
<i>between appropriate</i>

31:16.082 --> 31:17.792
<i>and inappropriate ways</i>

31:17.834 --> 31:20.086
<i>of being touched by an adult.</i>

31:20.128 --> 31:21.588
Yay!

31:23.923 --> 31:25.258
Now, kids,

31:25.300 --> 31:27.468
<i>sometimes an adult</i>
touches you

31:27.510 --> 31:28.511
<i>and that's okay,</i>

31:28.553 --> 31:30.138
<i>like a high five.</i>

31:30.179 --> 31:31.764
<i>Is that okay?</i>

31:31.806 --> 31:33.558
Yes!

31:33.600 --> 31:34.767
<i>[Carl]</i>
Now, what if an adult

31:34.809 --> 31:36.519
<i>makes you have sex</i>
without a condom?

31:36.561 --> 31:37.979
<i>Is that okay?</i>

31:38.021 --> 31:39.731
<i>-Sally, Sally...</i>
-Maybe we should just--

31:39.772 --> 31:42.191
See, I thought
Tish was a nice girl

31:42.233 --> 31:44.193
<i>until she started</i>
asking questions

31:44.235 --> 31:46.446
<i>about my pension</i>
and benefits,

31:46.487 --> 31:47.697
<i>and before I knew it,</i>

31:47.739 --> 31:49.198
<i>she was bouncing</i>
on my cock!

31:49.240 --> 31:50.491
<i>Cover your ears, kids.</i>

31:50.533 --> 31:51.492
Gallagher!

31:51.534 --> 31:53.244
<i>And now I have to pay alimony,</i>

31:53.286 --> 31:56.205
<i>child support, and live</i>
with my family forever!

32:06.174 --> 32:07.425
<i>Come on, Kev,</i>
come on, Kev...

32:07.467 --> 32:09.761
<i>I promised those</i>
to the guy today.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.137
<i>There's 20 grand</i>
on the line, Lip.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.639
<i>I know; he must've moved them</i>
somewhere, all right?

32:12.680 --> 32:14.390
<i>Moved them?</i>
Where?

32:14.432 --> 32:16.768
<i>I'm trying him.</i>

32:16.809 --> 32:18.227
<i>Fuck!</i>

32:22.565 --> 32:24.734
<i>Why can't we just push it</i>
into the water

32:24.776 --> 32:25.944
<i>from the beach?</i>

32:25.985 --> 32:28.321
<i>Too shallow.</i>
Somebody's gonna see it.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.117
<i>I'm gonna have to ride it</i>
off the end.

32:33.159 --> 32:34.702
<i>That is a terrible idea.</i>

32:34.744 --> 32:35.870

41:17.349 --> 41:19.310
<i>will it still work?</i>

41:19.351 --> 41:20.561
<i>Or if she only drinks</i>
half that drink,

41:20.603 --> 41:22.438
<i>will she end up having</i>
half a baby?

41:22.480 --> 41:23.564
<i>Or what if she's having twins?</i>

41:23.606 --> 41:25.191
<i>Will she end up</i>
only having one baby?

41:26.192 --> 41:28.152
<i>Should I just slip her</i>
two Plan Bs just in case?

41:28.194 --> 41:29.445
<i>Or what if I crush it down</i>
into a powder

41:29.487 --> 41:31.822
<i>and tell her it's coke,</i>
get her to snort it?

41:31.864 --> 41:34.074
<i>I mean, I don't know</i>
if she does coke, though.

41:34.116 --> 41:36.285
<i>She's trashy,</i>
so she probably does.

41:37.119 --> 41:39.121
<i>Why you so quiet?</i>
What do you think?

41:39.163 --> 41:40.456
Oh, my God.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.626
<i>You've dealt with this before,</i>
right, Bill?

41:52.718 --> 41:55.721
<i>Hey.</i>

41:55.763 --> 41:56.931
<i>How was the day?</i>

41:56.972 --> 41:58.557
<i>[Lip]</i> <i>Fine, good, yeah.</i>

41:59.850 --> 42:01.268
<i>You sell the Indian?</i>

42:01.310 --> 42:02.811
<i>Uh, I'm fielding some offers.</i>

42:02.853 --> 42:03.854
<i>[Tami]</i> <i>Okay.</i>

42:03.896 --> 42:05.189
<i>Uh, how's it looking</i>

42:05.231 --> 42:06.565
<i>with Liam and Carl?</i>

42:06.607 --> 42:08.234
<i>Uh, I haven't got</i>
ahold of them yet,

42:08.275 --> 42:09.318
<i>but I'm, uh, you know--</i>

42:09.360 --> 42:11.320
<i>I'm optimistic.</i>

42:12.238 --> 42:13.781
<i>-Okay.</i>

42:13.822 --> 42:15.366
<i>Uh, you gonna be home soon?</i>

42:15.407 --> 42:17.910
<i>No, I'll probably be a bit.</i>
There's a...

42:17.952 --> 42:19.912
<i>thing I gotta do first.</i>

42:21.580 --> 42:25.209
<i>Okay.</i>
I'll see you soon.

42:44.812 --> 42:47.064
Why are you naked?

42:48.274 --> 42:50.693
<i>I drove the chopper</i>
into Lake Michigan.

42:50.734 --> 42:52.570
<i>Do I wanna know more than that?</i>

42:52.611 --> 42:53.654
<i>No.</i>

42:53.696 --> 42:54.947
<i>How's Liam?</i>

42:54.989 --> 42:56.949
<i>Dropped him off.</i>
He's sad.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.951
<i>Well, you don't look</i>
much better.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.661
<i>No Black voters showed up.</i>

43:00.703 --> 43:02.496
<i>My mom's moving to Louisville.</i>

43:02.538 --> 43:03.706
<i>Carol's moving to Louisville?</i>

43:03.747 --> 43:07.751
<i>She says there's no community</i>
for her here anymore.

43:07.793 --> 43:09.628
<i>Oh, baby, I'm sorry.</i>

43:14.049 --> 43:16.260
Mm.

43:21.223 --> 43:22.433
Yeah.

43:22.474 --> 43:24.435
<i>You getting a boner?</i>

43:24.476 --> 43:26.186
<i>Yeah.</i>

43:26.228 --> 43:27.396
<i>Read the room.</i>

43:27.438 --> 43:28.689
<i>Oh, come on,</i>
Little Big Kev

43:28.731 --> 43:30.190
<i>has always made you</i>
feel better.

43:30.232 --> 43:32.067
<i>Not tonight.</i>

43:32.109 --> 43:33.611
<i>I just wanna crawl into bed</i>

43:33.652 --> 43:35.696
<i>and cry myself to sleep.</i>

43:35.738 --> 43:38.741
<i>subdued rock music</i>

43:41.994 --> 43:42.786
<i>Okay.</i>

43:42.828 --> 43:44.622
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
these are so great.

43:44.663 --> 43:46.290
<i>Perfect for a full can</i>
of Schlitz.

43:48.709 --> 43:50.628
<i>-Excuse me.</i>
-Carl?

43:50.669 --> 43:52.296
<i>Take this.</i>

43:53.005 --> 43:53.839
<i>Why?</i>

43:53.881 --> 43:54.882
<i>Because you rode me bareback</i>

43:54.923 --> 43:56.258
<i>so I'd plant a baby</i>
in your belly

43:56.300 --> 43:58.177
<i>and you could take half</i>
of everything I own.

43:58.218 --> 44:00.512
<i>But, oh, no, girl,</i>
I'm onto you.

44:00.554 --> 44:02.598
<i>So take this Plan B</i>
with a full bottle of water,

44:02.640 --> 44:03.974
<i>or I'm going to file</i>
a police report

44:04.016 --> 44:05.726
<i>saying you raped me.</i>

44:05.768 --> 44:07.394
<i>I'm on the pill.</i>

44:07.436 --> 44:10.022
<i>And ...thought you wanted</i>
to have sex.

44:10.064 --> 44:12.858
<i>I did, but with a condom.</i>

44:12.900 --> 44:14.693
<i>I'm allergic to latex.</i>

44:14.735 --> 44:17.071
<i>What, so you get, like,</i>
a rash or something?

44:17.112 --> 44:19.198
<i>Like, I'd die.</i>

44:19.239 --> 44:20.824
<i>Oh.</i>
Well...

44:20.866 --> 44:21.825
<i>then why were you asking</i>

44:21.867 --> 44:23.702
<i>about my job</i>
and benefits, then?

44:23.744 --> 44:26.455
<i>Because I liked you, Carl!</i>

44:27.206 --> 44:28.374
<i>Oh.</i>

44:28.415 --> 44:29.833
<i>Well, I liked you too.</i>

44:29.875 --> 44:31.335
<i>And you know what?</i>
It was nice.

44:31.377 --> 44:32.336
<i>It was nice to know</i>

44:32.378 --> 44:33.504
<i>that I wouldn't have</i>
to support you

44:33.545 --> 44:35.422
<i>after I finished</i>
dental hygienist school.

44:35.464 --> 44:36.590
<i>You're gonna be</i>
a dental hygienist?

44:36.632 --> 44:37.466
Yes!

44:37.508 --> 44:39.051
<i>I'll have my own job.</i>

44:39.093 --> 44:40.969
<i>I don't need</i>
some punk-ass rookie cop

44:41.011 --> 44:42.221
<i>taking care of me.</i>

44:42.930 --> 44:45.015
<i>[laughs]</i>
That's hot.

44:45.641 --> 44:47.351
<i>What time you get off work?</i>

44:47.976 --> 44:50.020
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

44:50.062 --> 44:53.273
<i>You dumped me,</i>
accused me of rape

44:53.315 --> 44:54.191
<i>and extortion,</i>

44:54.233 --> 44:55.984
<i>tried to force</i>
an abortion on me...

44:56.026 --> 44:57.486
<i>-Well--</i>
-...and now you wanna

44:57.528 --> 44:59.488
<i>hang out again?</i>

45:00.239 --> 45:01.657
<i>Yeah?</i>

45:02.324 --> 45:05.369
Okay, UFC tournament.

45:05.411 --> 45:08.747
<i>Best female pop stars</i>
of all time.

45:08.789 --> 45:09.873
<i>-Go.</i>
Okay.

45:09.915 --> 45:12.000
<i>So Celine beats Taylor...</i>

45:12.042 --> 45:13.627
<i>Oh.</i>
-...sorry, in the quarters

45:13.669 --> 45:16.255
<i>but then falls to Gaga</i>
in the semis,

45:16.296 --> 45:19.049
<i>and then it's Gaga</i>
and Aguilera in the finals.

45:19.091 --> 45:21.009
<i>Britney.</i>

45:21.051 --> 45:22.094
<i>Oh!</i>
Yes!

45:22.136 --> 45:23.554
It's Britney, bitch!

45:29.309 --> 45:31.520
<i>So you really</i>
don't like rimming?

45:31.562 --> 45:33.188
<i>What?</i>
Oh.

45:33.230 --> 45:34.773
<i>No, it was Mickey.</i>

45:34.815 --> 45:36.233
<i>He was kidding</i>
when he said it was me.

45:36.275 --> 45:38.277
<i>Oh, cool.</i>

45:38.318 --> 45:40.529
<i>So you do like rimming?</i>

45:41.113 --> 45:43.949
<i>Okay, Mickey,</i>
another cocktail?

45:47.035 --> 45:48.912
<i>Can we please get</i>
the fuck out of here?

45:48.954 --> 45:50.831
<i>You said we needed gay friends.</i>

45:50.873 --> 45:52.291
<i>Do you like any of these guys?</i>

45:52.332 --> 45:55.210
<i>Fuck no, I'm blowing my nut</i>
over this duck, though.

45:55.252 --> 45:56.545
Here it is!

45:56.587 --> 45:58.338
<i>Ah! Whoo!</i>

45:58.380 --> 45:59.757
<i>Oh!</i>
Oh, my God.

45:59.798 --> 46:00.758
<i>Whoo!</i>

46:00.799 --> 46:01.925
<i>[pop music playing]</i>
Rain on me

46:01.967 --> 46:03.135
<i>Rain, rain, rain on me</i>

46:03.177 --> 46:04.344
<i>Rain, rain</i>

46:04.386 --> 46:05.888
<i>[all singing along]</i>
I'd rather be dry

46:05.929 --> 46:08.265
<i>But at least I'm alive</i>

46:08.307 --> 46:10.350
<i>Rain on me, rain, rain</i>

46:10.392 --> 46:13.353
<i>Rain on me</i>

46:14.563 --> 46:17.274
<i>-Can we leave now?</i>
-Yeah.

46:17.316 --> 46:19.151
<i>Are you guys leaving?</i>

46:19.193 --> 46:21.570
<i>Things were just</i>
getting interesting.

46:21.612 --> 46:23.238
<i>Rain, rain, rain</i>

46:23.280 --> 46:24.448
<i>Rain...</i>

46:24.490 --> 46:25.491
<i>Whoo!</i>

46:25.532 --> 46:27.743
<i>I hear the thunder</i>
coming down

46:27.785 --> 46:29.620
<i>Won't you rain on me?</i>

46:29.661 --> 46:31.288
<i>Eh, yeah...</i>

46:31.330 --> 46:32.372
<i>No.</i>

46:32.414 --> 46:33.707
<i>You're the one who said</i>
if we fucked them,

46:33.749 --> 46:35.542
<i>we don't have to be friends</i>
with them.

46:35.584 --> 46:37.461
<i>Rain on me...</i>

46:37.503 --> 46:38.670
<i>Fine.</i>

46:38.712 --> 46:41.173
<i>Rain on me</i>

46:43.175 --> 46:46.303
<i>Hey, uh, Liam, buddy, look,</i>
I was thinking,

46:46.345 --> 46:47.846
<i>you know, if we sell the house,</i>

46:47.888 --> 46:49.932
<i>we could start a college fund</i>
for you,

46:49.973 --> 46:51.308
<i>so, uh, anyway,</i>

46:51.350 --> 46:52.309
<i>something to talk about.</i>

46:52.351 --> 46:53.602
<i>Give me a call back</i>
when you can.

46:53.644 --> 46:54.812
<i>All right, bye.</i>

46:56.021 --> 46:57.481
<i>Tami?</i>

46:59.316 --> 47:01.360
<i>-Little man?</i>

47:02.736 --> 47:05.072
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

47:06.907 --> 47:08.826
<i>All right, hey.</i>
-Hey.

47:08.867 --> 47:10.452
<i>-Hey, you give me a hand?</i>
-What's-what's going on?

47:10.494 --> 47:11.370
<i>We get robbed, or...</i>

47:11.411 --> 47:13.413
<i>-No, no, he just woke up.</i>
-Hey, hi, buddy.

47:13.455 --> 47:14.832
<i>Yeah, I just packed up</i>
some stuff

47:14.873 --> 47:17.000
<i>and brought it over</i>
to my dad's.

47:25.092 --> 47:27.052
<i>Oh.</i>

47:27.094 --> 47:29.513
<i>I'll be right back,</i>
buddy, okay?

47:32.933 --> 47:35.519
<i>Hey, uh, why-why did you</i>
take our stuff

47:35.561 --> 47:36.520
<i>to your dad's place?</i>

47:36.562 --> 47:37.896
<i>I-I thought we talked</i>
about this.

47:37.938 --> 47:40.274
<i>Yeah, w-we said you had the day</i>
to sell the Indian

47:40.315 --> 47:42.234
<i>or convince your family</i>
to sell the house.

47:42.276 --> 47:43.694
<i>The day's not over.</i>

47:43.735 --> 47:47.531
<i>Okay, well, you didn't sound</i>
too hopeful on the phone, so...

47:47.573 --> 47:48.615
<i>Uh, I thought we said</i>

47:48.657 --> 47:50.284
<i>if I couldn't make it</i>
happen today,

47:50.325 --> 47:52.494
<i>then we would talk</i>
about what's next, right?

47:53.120 --> 47:55.873
<i>What did you think</i>
was next, Lip?

47:55.914 --> 47:58.208
<i>That I would try again</i>
tomorrow.

47:58.250 --> 48:00.669
<i>I thought what was next</i>
was that we would make

48:00.711 --> 48:02.880
<i>the most stable decision</i>
for our family.

48:02.921 --> 48:04.673
<i>I put in an application</i>
at Amazon.

48:04.715 --> 48:06.508
<i>All right?</i>
Like you asked.

48:06.550 --> 48:07.509
<i>Can you meet me halfway?</i>

48:07.551 --> 48:10.012
<i>Halfway to homelessness?</i>

48:10.053 --> 48:11.680
<i>No.</i>
No, Lip.

48:11.722 --> 48:13.599
<i>I'm not gonna meet you halfway.</i>

48:13.640 --> 48:15.142
<i>And, God, what is up</i>
with you lately?

48:15.183 --> 48:16.476
<i>Nothing, nothing is up</i>
with me lately.

48:16.518 --> 48:18.270
<i>Really? Because you're being</i>
entirely unreasonable.

48:18.312 --> 48:19.980
<i>-You're obsessive.</i>
-Okay, you wanna catalog shit?

48:20.022 --> 48:21.231
You are fucking
stealing shit

48:21.273 --> 48:22.357
<i>'Cause I can take</i>
the notebook out, all right?

48:22.399 --> 48:23.775
<i>-Are you drinking again?</i>
-No!

48:23.817 --> 48:26.278
<i>Jesus, I just don't wanna live</i>
with your fucking family!

48:26.320 --> 48:27.863
<i>Okay, well, tough shit.</i>

48:27.905 --> 48:29.448
<i>You had the day</i>
to make your plan work.

48:29.489 --> 48:30.908
<i>You didn't make it work.</i>

48:30.949 --> 48:32.492
<i>So unless you make</i>
something happen

48:32.534 --> 48:35.037
<i>before we go to bed tonight...</i>

48:35.078 --> 48:37.039
<i>Where are you going?</i>

48:42.377 --> 48:43.503
Hey.

48:43.545 --> 48:44.963
<i>Who's the kid?</i>

48:45.005 --> 48:46.131
<i>Sandy's son.</i>

48:46.173 --> 48:47.758
<i>You decide</i>
about the house yet?

48:47.799 --> 48:49.760
<i>Leave me alone.</i>
I'm heartbroken.

48:55.641 --> 48:57.684
<i>Why is he still here?</i>

48:57.726 --> 48:59.603
<i>Royal's not done</i>
at Pizzeria Uno.

49:00.187 --> 49:02.022
<i>But you should know</i>
that I'm gonna talk to him

49:02.064 --> 49:04.066
<i>about us getting joint custody</i>
of Prince.

49:04.983 --> 49:06.735
<i>Uh, why?</i>

49:06.777 --> 49:07.861
<i>If you're gonna be living</i>
with me,

49:07.903 --> 49:09.112
<i>you're gonna be living</i>
with my rules,

49:09.154 --> 49:11.156
<i>and my rules are that</i>
you don't abandon family.

49:13.533 --> 49:15.953
<i>Well, I guess</i>
I'm not living with you, then.

49:15.994 --> 49:17.287
<i>What?</i>

49:17.329 --> 49:19.498
<i>No.</i>
Sandy!

49:24.044 --> 49:26.338
<i>Sandy!</i>
Sandy!

49:27.798 --> 49:28.674
<i>What are you doing?</i>

49:28.715 --> 49:30.258
<i>I'm getting the fuck</i>
out of here.

49:30.300 --> 49:31.760
<i>Ha.</i>
Great.

49:31.802 --> 49:34.304
<i>Add me to the list of people</i>
you run out on.

49:34.346 --> 49:35.806
<i>I don't run out</i>
on people, Debbie.

49:35.847 --> 49:37.391
<i>-It's not that simple.</i>
It is.

49:37.432 --> 49:38.558
<i>You-you either stick</i>
with people,

49:38.600 --> 49:39.518
<i>or you don't.</i>

49:39.559 --> 49:40.727
<i>I stick with people.</i>

49:40.769 --> 49:41.979
<i>Yeah, I stuck with you,</i>

49:42.020 --> 49:44.147
<i>until you turned out to be</i>
a fucking psycho.

49:44.189 --> 49:46.066
<i>Well, that's not sticking</i>
with me.

49:46.108 --> 49:47.067
<i>That's cutting and running.</i>

49:47.109 --> 49:49.444
<i>People don't just</i>
cut and run, okay?

49:49.486 --> 49:50.737
<i>There are reasons.</i>

49:50.779 --> 49:52.072
<i>I ran out on Prince and Royal</i>

49:52.114 --> 49:53.782
<i>because I had no idea</i>
who I was.

49:53.824 --> 49:54.908
That's selfish.

49:54.950 --> 49:55.867
<i>It's not selfish.</i>

49:55.909 --> 49:58.412
<i>That is the definition</i>
of selfish!

49:58.453 --> 50:00.122
<i>You ran out on people</i>
who needed you

50:00.163 --> 50:02.791
<i>because you wanted to go do</i>
your own shit.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.543
<i>I'll never forgive you</i>
for that.

50:06.378 --> 50:08.422
<i>You'll never forgive me</i>
for that?

50:08.463 --> 50:11.883
<i>They'll never.</i>
Prince will never.

50:11.925 --> 50:13.677
<i>Holy shit.</i>

50:15.220 --> 50:17.014
<i>You think I'm Monica.</i>

50:17.055 --> 50:20.225
<i>-What?</i>
-I am not your mom, Debbie.

50:20.267 --> 50:22.060
<i>I didn't just leave my family</i>
to do my own shit.

50:22.102 --> 50:23.979
<i>This has nothing to do</i>
with my mom.

50:24.021 --> 50:25.856
<i>Fuck you.</i>

50:25.897 --> 50:27.607
You are piling

50:27.649 --> 50:30.527
<i>all your abandonment issues</i>
on me.

50:30.569 --> 50:32.529
<i>Right?</i>
'Cause what happened?

50:32.571 --> 50:35.824
<i>Monica ran out on you...</i>

50:35.866 --> 50:38.035
<i>and now the rest of them</i>
wanna run out on you too.

50:38.076 --> 50:39.202
<i>They don't wanna run out on me.</i>

50:39.244 --> 50:40.996
<i>They wanna sell the house</i>
and get the money.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.581
You sure?

51:00.849 --> 51:03.185
Night.

51:03.226 --> 51:05.395
<i>[sighs]</i>
That was a bust, huh?

51:05.437 --> 51:06.855
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
apart from a hand job,

51:06.897 --> 51:09.441
<i>duck, and orgy, total waste</i>
of a fucking day.

51:10.150 --> 51:12.069
<i>Still think we need</i>
gay friends?

51:12.110 --> 51:13.278
<i>Need?</i>

51:13.320 --> 51:14.654
<i>No.</i>
I mean, I'm not opposed to it.

51:14.696 --> 51:17.699
<i>We just...we want friends</i>
we have things in common with.

51:17.741 --> 51:20.327
<i>There's a reason</i>
I do the same things as Lip.

51:20.368 --> 51:21.870
<i>I'm like Lip.</i>

51:21.912 --> 51:24.456
<i>I'm okay if he's</i>
my only friend for now.

51:24.498 --> 51:25.540
<i>All right.</i>

51:25.582 --> 51:29.044
<i>Well, wanna go tell Debbie</i>
you wanna do what Lip wants

51:29.086 --> 51:30.462
<i>on this thing?</i>

51:30.504 --> 51:31.671
<i>She's gonna love you.</i>

51:31.713 --> 51:33.256
<i>She's gonna love you so much.</i>

51:33.298 --> 51:35.634
<i>[Sandy]</i> <i>Debbie!</i>

51:35.675 --> 51:37.761
<i>Come on!</i>
Open up.

51:37.803 --> 51:38.887
<i>What's going on upstairs?</i>

51:38.929 --> 51:39.971
I'm not sure.

51:40.013 --> 51:41.014
<i>Hey, do you guys think</i>
it's weird

51:41.056 --> 51:41.932
<i>I'm in love with my rapist?</i>

51:41.973 --> 51:43.350
<i>-You weren't raped.</i>
-Yes.

51:44.601 --> 51:45.936
<i>I don't wanna sell the house.</i>

51:45.977 --> 51:47.145
<i>Where have you been?</i>

51:47.187 --> 51:48.605
<i>Out finding my voice.</i>

51:48.647 --> 51:50.273
<i>Wait, you're voting</i>
not to sell?

51:50.315 --> 51:51.775
<i>Yeah.</i>

51:51.817 --> 51:54.277
<i>So it's you two and Debbie.</i>
That's it, right?

51:54.319 --> 51:56.363
<i>Doesn't matter what I vote.</i>
We're not selling.

51:56.404 --> 51:57.489
<i>Well, I wanna change my vote.</i>

51:57.531 --> 51:59.157
<i>Mickey and I</i>
want our own place.

51:59.199 --> 52:01.368
<i>So it's two in favor,</i>
two against?

52:01.409 --> 52:04.121
<i>Yeah, me and Lip</i>
versus Liam and Debbie.

52:14.506 --> 52:16.633
<i>Fiona...</i>

52:16.675 --> 52:18.593
<i>Lip!</i>

52:19.636 --> 52:23.265
<i>Carl!</i>

52:25.809 --> 52:28.019
<i>Debbie?</i>
Lip?

52:28.061 --> 52:30.438
<i>-Out of the way, Frank.</i>
-Lip!

52:39.322 --> 52:40.490
<i>[Liam]</i> <i>If you vote</i>
not to sell...

52:40.532 --> 52:41.449
<i>Lip!</i>

52:41.491 --> 52:42.742
<i>...I'll iron your uniform</i>
for a whole month.

52:42.784 --> 52:44.703
<i>Vote to sell, I'll buy you</i>
pizza rolls for a year.

52:44.744 --> 52:45.620
<i>How about vote to sell,</i>

52:45.662 --> 52:46.788
<i>and I won't scoop</i>
your eyeballs out

52:46.830 --> 52:49.166
<i>-with a fucking kitchen spoon?</i>

52:49.207 --> 52:50.041
<i>Shit.</i>

52:50.083 --> 52:52.127
<i>rock music</i>

52:52.169 --> 52:53.587
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

52:53.628 --> 52:55.255
<i>Creating an open floor plan.</i>

52:55.297 --> 52:56.381
<i>We're selling!</i>

52:56.423 --> 52:57.549
<i>-No! No.</i>
Hey!

52:57.591 --> 52:59.509
<i>-Deb! Deb!</i>
Relax, relax.

52:59.551 --> 53:02.345
<i>Whoa, oh, oh,</i>
oh, oh, oh, oh...

53:02.387 --> 53:04.222
<i>Fuck you!</i>

53:04.264 --> 53:05.432
<i>Whoa, oh, oh</i>

53:05.473 --> 53:06.641
<i>Whoa, oh, oh...</i>

53:08.101 --> 53:09.853
<i>Don't look back,</i>
don't look back

53:09.895 --> 53:11.980
<i>Don't look back...</i>

53:19.654 --> 53:20.614
Excuse me.

53:20.655 --> 53:22.115
<i>Does Phillip Gallagher</i>
live here?

53:22.157 --> 53:23.283
<i>We have a few questions</i>

53:23.325 --> 53:25.660
<i>about a robbery</i>
where he used to work.

53:25.702 --> 53:26.912
<i>He's inside.</i>
Just be careful.

53:26.953 --> 53:28.079
<i>He's got a sledgehammer.</i>

53:28.121 --> 53:30.290
<i>That's why</i>

53:30.332 --> 53:32.792
<i>Whoa, oh, oh,</i>
oh, oh, oh

53:32.834 --> 53:35.295
<i>Oh, whoa, oh, oh,</i>
oh, oh

53:35.337 --> 53:38.256
<i>Whoa, oh, oh,</i>
whoa, oh, oh

53:38.548 --> 53:40.133
<i>Coming down on me</i>

53:40.175 --> 53:42.469
<i>Teardrops on my face</i>

53:42.510 --> 53:44.387
<i>Water like...</i>

53:52.270 --> 53:55.565
<i>I can feel it on my skin</i>

53:58.401 --> 54:01.279
<i>It's coming down on me</i>

54:02.405 --> 54:04.532
<i>Teardrops on my face</i>

54:04.574 --> 54:06.076
<i>Water like misery</i>

54:06.117 --> 54:08.411
<i>Let it wash away my pain</i>

54:08.453 --> 54:10.580
<i>It's coming down on me</i>

54:10.622 --> 54:13.750
<i>[both]</i> <i>Let it wash away</i>

54:13.792 --> 54:15.085
<i>I'd rather be dry</i>

54:15.126 --> 54:17.420
<i>But at least I'm alive</i>

54:17.462 --> 54:19.214
<i>Rain on me, rain, rain</i>

54:19.256 --> 54:21.383
<i>Rain on me,</i>
rain, rain

54:21.424 --> 54:22.926
<i>I'd rather be dry</i>

54:22.968 --> 54:25.095
<i>But at least I'm alive</i>

54:25.136 --> 54:27.514
<i>Rain on me, rain, rain</i>

54:27.555 --> 54:29.641
<i>Rain...on...me</i>

54:29.683 --> 54:31.935
<i>I hear the thunder</i>
coming down

54:31.977 --> 54:33.895
<i>Won't you rain on me?</i>

54:33.937 --> 54:35.480
<i>Eh, yeah</i>

54:35.522 --> 54:37.148
<i>Rain on, whoo</i>

54:37.190 --> 54:39.734
<i>I hear the thunder</i>
coming down

54:39.776 --> 54:41.569
<i>Won't you rain on me?</i>

54:41.611 --> 54:43.363
<i>Eh, yeah</i>
