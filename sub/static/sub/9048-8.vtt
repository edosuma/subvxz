09:23.020 --> 09:25.854
I spent at Staples last week.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.390
Hold up.
Is that caramel spell?

09:28.392 --> 09:29.692
- Obvi.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.094
- Scooch over, girl.

09:32.096 --> 09:32.528
- Hey.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.597
I didn't mean
that you don't understand

09:34.599 --> 09:37.933
because you're still
in high school.

09:37.935 --> 09:39.835
I just--
[sighs]

09:39.837 --> 09:40.569
I'm on scholarship here.

09:40.571 --> 09:44.406
And if I don't make my grades,
I'll lose it, and then I'm out.

09:44.408 --> 09:47.243
There's no way I can afford
this place otherwise.

09:47.245 --> 09:50.412
So midterms are
an extra-stressful time of year

09:50.414 --> 09:52.681
for me.

09:52.683 --> 09:55.050
- I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

09:55.052 --> 09:55.985
- I wanted to tell you.

09:55.987 --> 09:58.120
I just know you maybe
have this picture of me

09:58.122 --> 10:01.657
as this cool, confident
college guy, which I am.

10:01.659 --> 10:04.293
I totally am, like, all day.
- Right.

10:04.295 --> 10:07.997
- But I'm also a complete
dorkus about school.

10:07.999 --> 10:09.898
I put myself
on lockdown this weekend

10:09.900 --> 10:11.367
so I could
get everything done

10:11.369 --> 10:15.237
and make time for the important
things in my life...

10:15.239 --> 10:15.804
Like you.

10:15.806 --> 10:18.107
- In that moment,
Luke was everything--

10:18.109 --> 10:21.076
his vulnerability,
his honesty, his work ethic,

10:21.078 --> 10:23.345
no games,
straight lines.

10:23.347 --> 10:24.213
He was a great boyfriend,

10:24.215 --> 10:27.583
and I wanted to be
an equally great girlfriend.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.083
Okay.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.585
If you need to keep
this scholarship,

10:29.587 --> 10:31.954
then we need
to get down to brass tacks.

10:31.956 --> 10:33.289
Hand me those flash cards.

10:33.291 --> 10:36.525
I am going
to lend-lease you a hand.

10:36.527 --> 10:38.427
- "Lend-lease"?
Really?

10:38.429 --> 10:41.797
- I regretted it
as soon as I said it.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.567
- My parents abandoned me.

10:45.569 --> 10:46.402
Trouble kept finding me.

10:46.404 --> 10:50.072
Soon, the streets
became my true Moms and Pops.

10:50.074 --> 10:52.141
I was raised
on the block, son.

10:52.143 --> 10:55.177
I got my PhD
in straight hustling, homey.

10:55.179 --> 10:57.346
- Yeah, I can relate, man.

10:57.348 --> 10:59.581
I just found out I was adopted.

10:59.583 --> 11:00.215
- Really?

11:00.217 --> 11:03.652
By some rich-bitch
mother[bleep] up in P.V.?

11:03.654 --> 11:04.853
- Yeah, but--

11:04.855 --> 11:06.822
- they fed you,
bought you clothes?

11:06.824 --> 11:08.023
- They did, but--

11:08.025 --> 11:10.526
- what kind of car you drive?

11:10.528 --> 11:12.194
- Escalade.

11:12.196 --> 11:13.429
Drove it off a cliff.

11:13.431 --> 11:15.964
- [laughs]
An Escalade?

11:15.966 --> 11:16.532
Damn, son.

11:16.534 --> 11:17.966
They ain't even
have the courtesy

11:17.968 --> 11:20.769
to buy their adopted boy
an "S" class.

11:20.771 --> 11:25.908
Homey, you got adopted
by some straight jerks.

11:25.910 --> 11:29.411
[laughing]

11:29.413 --> 11:31.547
"Drove it off a cliff."

11:31.549 --> 11:34.616
[chuckling]

11:35.418 --> 11:35.951
- Come on, Luke.

11:35.953 --> 11:38.721
What were the main points
of the Potsdam Treaty?

11:38.723 --> 11:42.991
- I think it was...

11:44.127 --> 11:46.061
- I thought you had to study.

11:46.063 --> 11:49.031
- I think we've studied enough
for the night.

11:49.033 --> 11:52.167
I just want to enjoy you.

11:54.003 --> 11:55.137
- I came here tonight
to hook up,

11:55.139 --> 11:57.873
but it's been
a complete fail Mary.

11:57.875 --> 11:58.507
What's the deal?

11:58.509 --> 12:00.776
I thought college guys were
supposed to be so much cooler,

12:00.778 --> 12:02.678
but they're
just like high-school guys,

12:02.680 --> 12:04.480
plus 2 years and 20 pounds.

12:04.482 --> 12:05.781
- I did the guy thing
for a while,

12:05.783 --> 12:09.084
but it wasn't until I was with
a woman that everything clicked.

12:09.086 --> 12:11.487
I mean, guys just take
so much longer to evolve

12:11.489 --> 12:12.154
into functional adults.

12:12.156 --> 12:14.390
And the road to get there
is filled with douche stops.

12:14.392 --> 12:16.258
- Oh, talk to me
about douche stops.

12:16.260 --> 12:20.028
My last boyfriend went into
a "Mumford and Dumbs" phase.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.598
So "trajnoxious."

12:22.600 --> 12:24.199
"Tragic" plus "obnoxious."

12:24.201 --> 12:24.900
- That sounds horrible.

12:24.902 --> 12:27.469
- Not to mention
he could never buy me a ticket

12:27.471 --> 12:29.705
to ride
the big oh-llercoaster.

12:29.707 --> 12:30.973
- You know what they say.

12:30.975 --> 12:33.742
Never send a man
to do a woman's job.

12:33.744 --> 12:35.711
[both laugh]

12:35.713 --> 12:37.479
- Okay, I need to stop
or get a towel

12:37.481 --> 12:41.784
for the serious verbal vom
that's happening right now.

12:41.786 --> 12:43.318
Nice, huh?

12:48.191 --> 12:49.992
- Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

12:49.994 --> 12:52.327
I totally misread the situation.

12:52.329 --> 12:55.664
- Let's do this.

13:06.609 --> 13:09.878
- Hey.

13:13.049 --> 13:14.650
Freedom.

13:14.652 --> 13:16.718
- ♪ Right now
we've only just begun ♪

13:16.720 --> 13:20.856
♪ open up your eyes and see

13:20.858 --> 13:21.523
♪

13:21.525 --> 13:24.059
- ugh. Shayne, you've got
to stop hooking up

13:24.061 --> 13:26.395
with girls in my bed.

13:26.397 --> 13:27.596
- Good morning.

13:27.598 --> 13:30.666
- Oh, my God.

13:30.668 --> 13:32.901
- Walker, you have a visitor.

13:32.903 --> 13:34.703
- That's you.

13:34.705 --> 13:36.104
Let me go.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.339
- Are you insane?

13:37.341 --> 13:38.207
- This might be my one shot

13:38.209 --> 13:41.009
at getting
to an actual bathroom, man.

13:41.011 --> 13:42.144
- Fine.

13:42.146 --> 13:46.882
But whoever it is,
you get us out of here.

13:46.884 --> 13:48.817
- I'm Walker.

13:54.190 --> 13:56.792
Is there
a real bathroom anywhere?

13:56.794 --> 14:00.796
Even a plastic bag
would do at this point.

14:02.866 --> 14:04.433
Sadie, how did you find us?

14:04.435 --> 14:07.703
- I was there when Matty got
his fake last night, dickweed.

14:07.705 --> 14:08.604
And since you left with Eva,

14:08.606 --> 14:10.506
I figured you were dead
or in prison.

14:10.508 --> 14:12.774
Oh, and the recorded call
from county helped.

14:12.776 --> 14:14.810
Now, what the [bleep]
happened to you?

14:14.812 --> 14:16.478
- Matty and I got busted
for drinking.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.914
We showed the cops our fakes,
and they bought them,

14:18.916 --> 14:20.582
but then Matty
started mouthing off,

14:20.584 --> 14:22.985
so he got us arrested
for open containers.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.986
- Where was Eva?

14:23.988 --> 14:25.888
- I don't know.
She was there, but she bailed.

14:25.890 --> 14:27.589
- That bitch ditched?

14:27.591 --> 14:30.158
I'm going to [bleep] kill her.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.059
Oh, relax.

14:31.061 --> 14:33.996
- Sadie, if I don't get
out of here soon,

14:33.998 --> 14:36.632
I'm gonna do something
really bad.

14:36.634 --> 14:38.834
- You're gonna hurt someone?

14:38.836 --> 14:39.735
- No.

14:39.737 --> 14:43.105
I'm gonna [bleep] myself.

14:43.107 --> 14:45.440
- Listen, dumb-ass,
give up your fakes,

14:45.442 --> 14:46.308
tell the cops you're minors,

14:46.310 --> 14:48.010
and legally,
they can't hold you.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.646
If they even hesitate,
tell them that your friend

14:50.648 --> 14:52.447
is going to tweet
at <i>The L.A. Times</i>

14:52.449 --> 14:54.383
that their incompetence
is endangering the lives

14:54.385 --> 14:57.252
of two cute, innocent
high-school boys,

14:57.254 --> 15:00.856
and it'll go viral
faster than HPV at Coachella.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.158
And they'll be mall cops
at the Beverly Center

15:03.160 --> 15:06.194
for the rest
of their meaningless lives.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.162
- Whoa.

15:07.164 --> 15:07.696
Okay.

15:07.698 --> 15:08.931
- With processing
and everything,

15:08.933 --> 15:10.899
you should be out in an hour.
- Thank you.

15:10.901 --> 15:13.235
Oh, hey, wait.
How do you know all this stuff?

15:13.237 --> 15:16.505
- <i>Orange Is the New Black.</i>
- Hmm.

15:16.507 --> 15:21.643
- And the next thing you know,
we were breast friends...

15:21.645 --> 15:23.478
Hands everywhere.

15:23.480 --> 15:24.212
I think we had sex--

15:24.214 --> 15:26.315
not 100% sure, but I did
feel, like, 1,000 volts

15:26.317 --> 15:27.950
shoot through my thighs
at one point,

15:27.952 --> 15:29.318
and my eyes rolled back
into my head,

15:29.320 --> 15:32.421
and the orgasms just kept
coming, fast and bi-furious.

15:32.423 --> 15:35.524
I swear I saw Jesus
surfing a rainbow-colored star.

15:35.526 --> 15:37.960
- So does this mean you're--
- "heteroflexible"?

15:37.962 --> 15:40.629
Maybe, though I think
it's more like that time

15:40.631 --> 15:42.698
I wore a blazer around
for a week.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.434
Looks good on Ellen,
but not for me.

15:45.436 --> 15:47.035
- And when Mom
was over in Seattle,

15:47.037 --> 15:48.136
she moved down here
with Sonic Youth,

15:48.138 --> 15:51.106
so there's, like, a 65% chance
I'm Eddie Vedder's kid.

15:51.108 --> 15:52.507
And then there was
that brief period

15:52.509 --> 15:55.377
that Kurt and Courtney
broke up, so...

15:55.379 --> 15:56.445
- No.
- Yeah.

15:56.447 --> 15:57.479
- Get out of my face.

15:57.481 --> 16:01.149
- Kurt Fuller and Courtney Cox
might be your parents?

16:01.151 --> 16:01.583
So cool.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.785
- I was almost the kid
on the cover of <i>Nevermind,</i>

16:03.787 --> 16:07.222
but my mother's
a very private person.

16:07.224 --> 16:09.324
- [clears throat]

16:09.326 --> 16:11.960
- Hi, kids.
How was your night?

16:11.962 --> 16:13.629
- Nothing too crazy--

16:13.631 --> 16:15.597
concert and then
right back to Tamara's.

16:15.599 --> 16:18.900
- Okay, don't worry.
I am off the clock.

16:18.902 --> 16:21.403
There is no need
to censor yourself.

16:21.405 --> 16:24.339
I'm not Counselor Marks
in your home.

16:24.341 --> 16:27.142
I am just Val the pal.

16:27.144 --> 16:28.810
- Eva, what's up?

16:28.812 --> 16:30.979
- Oh, my God.
I'm so glad to see you.

16:30.981 --> 16:31.913
I really need to talk.

16:31.915 --> 16:34.883
Lacey said I should just
hang out until you got home.

16:34.885 --> 16:37.185
- Lacey.
- Hmm.

16:37.187 --> 16:41.089
- Why don't we go talk
in my room?

16:41.091 --> 16:42.457
- Sit, spill.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.192
How was the concert?
Any highlights?

16:44.194 --> 16:47.863
- Just the ones slipping
through my fingers this morning.

16:47.865 --> 16:49.765
- Do tell.

16:49.767 --> 16:52.834
- Lesbi honest.
I kissed a girl.

16:52.836 --> 16:53.969
- Whoa!

16:53.971 --> 16:54.803
- Boom!

16:54.805 --> 16:56.238
- Bi-curious George.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.239
- Interesting.

16:57.241 --> 17:01.076
Well, that's a thing that--
that some people do.

17:01.078 --> 17:01.677
- Oh, please.

17:01.679 --> 17:04.646
Once you've knocked a few back,
a mouth is just a mouth.

17:04.648 --> 17:09.184
- Well, I could never do that
with a girl.

17:09.186 --> 17:10.185
- Oh, really?

17:10.187 --> 17:13.922
Newport beach, junior year?

17:14.557 --> 17:16.024
That wasn't Kevin, hon.

17:16.026 --> 17:19.327
- Oh, my God!
[gasps]

17:19.329 --> 17:20.495
- They're in jail?

17:20.497 --> 17:22.364
- I know, and I totally
would have stuck around,

17:22.366 --> 17:24.700
but after my shoplifting thing
last year,

17:24.702 --> 17:27.002
my Dad would have frozen
my trust.

17:27.004 --> 17:27.669
- Okay, this is insane.

17:27.671 --> 17:30.038
- I was hoping you could go down
to the station with me

17:30.040 --> 17:30.972
and help get them out.

17:30.974 --> 17:32.908
- Matty's
self-destructive streak

17:32.910 --> 17:33.775
had hit an all-time high.

17:33.777 --> 17:36.678
But it wasn't my responsibility
to be his savior anymore.

17:36.680 --> 17:37.946
I'm gonna give you
his brother's number.

17:37.948 --> 17:42.884
Call him. He'll know exactly
how to handle this situation.

17:46.556 --> 17:48.523
[buzzer sounds]

17:48.525 --> 17:49.758
- Hey, all we have to do

17:49.760 --> 17:51.560
is tell them we're minors,
and they'll let us go.

17:51.562 --> 17:53.829
- But if we say that,
they'll know we had fake I.Ds.

17:53.831 --> 17:55.764
- Ugh.
We will deal with that later.

17:55.766 --> 17:58.667
All I know is that this place
will be painted brown

17:58.669 --> 18:00.035
if we don't get
out of here right now.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.171
So let's go.
- Okay, okay.

18:03.173 --> 18:03.739
Uh...

18:03.741 --> 18:06.875
Yo, Jordan,
uh, we're getting out, man.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.277
- Beat the rap.
Enjoy it, son.

18:09.279 --> 18:10.112
- Thank you so much,

18:10.114 --> 18:12.647
and I learned a lot
hearing about your struggles.

18:12.649 --> 18:14.983
You know,
if I can ever do something

18:14.985 --> 18:15.851
to help you get out of here.

18:15.853 --> 18:18.620
Maybe put you in touch
with some good attorneys...

18:18.622 --> 18:21.123
- Attorneys?
Dude, I <i>am</i> an attorney.

18:21.125 --> 18:24.126
- You are?
- Stanford, class of '02.

18:24.128 --> 18:27.062
- And you killed a man?

18:27.064 --> 18:29.931
- What the [bleep]
are you talking about?

18:29.933 --> 18:31.333
- Uh, you--
you pulled a trigger.

18:31.335 --> 18:32.801
You made some things
disappear.

18:32.803 --> 18:34.603
- Yeah, I work
in an investment bank.

18:34.605 --> 18:37.072
I shorted some securities
that I couldn't cover,

18:37.074 --> 18:40.208
and then I made
the transaction disappear.

18:40.210 --> 18:40.742
- Oh.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.711
- Now I'm gonna [bleep]
you up!

18:42.713 --> 18:44.713
- We're minors!
We're minors!

18:44.715 --> 18:48.116
- And I really have to go
to the bathroom!

18:48.118 --> 18:49.417
- Choices--

18:49.419 --> 18:50.685
sometimes you need
to make the hard choice

18:50.687 --> 18:53.221
to cut someone out of your life,
or else you won't be open

18:53.223 --> 18:58.160
to the possibility of someone
new and amazing coming into it.

18:58.162 --> 19:00.862
- Feel better?
- Oh, much better.

19:00.864 --> 19:02.297
I can't wait to get home,
though.

19:02.299 --> 19:04.266
I'm exhausted.
- Me too.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.700
- Are you going back home?

19:05.702 --> 19:10.038
- Yeah, I guess.
There's worse places, you know.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.840
- Mm.

19:13.676 --> 19:15.510
- I'm so glad you guys
are okay.

19:15.512 --> 19:17.846
- Eva, what the [bleep]?
You totally bailed on us.

19:17.848 --> 19:21.817
- Hey, hey, hey,
let me handle this.

19:21.819 --> 19:22.684
So what happened back there?

19:22.686 --> 19:25.954
- Matty, I'm so sorry,
but I've been in trouble before,

19:25.956 --> 19:26.755
and if I mess up again,

19:26.757 --> 19:30.058
my Dad's sending me back
to New York, and my mother--

19:30.060 --> 19:34.362
so I went to find help.
I went to Jenna first and...

19:34.364 --> 19:34.830
- And?

19:34.832 --> 19:37.299
- Well, to be honest, Matty,
she was kind of rude.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.266
She said she couldn't help

19:38.268 --> 19:40.435
and that the person
that would know about jail

19:40.437 --> 19:43.004
was your drug addict brother.

19:43.006 --> 19:45.373
I'm sorry.
I came back here after

19:45.375 --> 19:47.442
and just trying to think
of something else,

19:47.444 --> 19:50.779
and I've just been waiting
for you.

19:50.781 --> 19:51.313
- Thank you.

19:51.315 --> 19:54.883
- It's been, like,
the worst first date ever,

19:54.885 --> 19:55.350
right?

19:55.352 --> 19:57.586
I didn't even get
a good-night kiss.

19:57.588 --> 19:59.487
- Yeah.

19:59.489 --> 20:03.024
What about a good-morning one?

20:07.230 --> 20:09.731
- What about a conjugal visit?

20:13.269 --> 20:14.002
- After that night,

20:14.004 --> 20:15.871
I knew if my head
was full of Matty McKibben,

20:15.873 --> 20:17.806
it would get in the way
of opening my heart to Luke,

20:17.808 --> 20:21.376
and I wasn't going to let
my Matty story, which was over,

20:21.378 --> 20:25.814
mess up my Luke story,
which was just beginning.

20:37.760 --> 20:38.894
- Next on <i>Awkward...</i>

20:38.896 --> 20:39.494
- This was it.

20:39.496 --> 20:41.029
Once I hit send,
there was no turning back.

20:41.031 --> 20:41.596
- Surprise.

20:41.598 --> 20:42.998
- Next fall I'd be starting
a whole new life.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.367
- Is there a reason why
you haven't sent me my essay?

20:45.369 --> 20:46.534
- Matty, if you want
your essay so bad,

20:46.536 --> 20:48.570
why don't you go
and get it yourself?

20:48.572 --> 20:49.738
- Whew! Got it.

20:49.740 --> 20:51.673
- You promised me dessert.

20:51.675 --> 20:53.174
- Skanky jank!

20:53.176 --> 20:55.677
- Not mine.

20:55.679 --> 20:57.012
Eva's?
