00:01.925 --> 00:03.626
- Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>
- I want Matty to date.

00:03.628 --> 00:04.761
- Why don't you set him up
yourself?

00:04.763 --> 00:05.795
- Maybe I will.
- Matty and I kissed.

00:05.797 --> 00:08.531
- You're a liar, and I need
to break up with you.

00:08.533 --> 00:08.965
- What?

00:08.967 --> 00:10.400
- I promise not to interfere
with you or Eva.

00:10.402 --> 00:12.168
- We don't need
each other's blessings, Jenna.

00:12.170 --> 00:12.935
We're not together.

00:12.937 --> 00:14.504
- Out of the car right now.
Right now, come on.

00:14.506 --> 00:16.239
- We didn't do anything wrong.

00:18.008 --> 00:19.275
- The night so far
had been an epic fail.

00:19.277 --> 00:22.245
Three girls, three fights,
and two broken hearts.

00:22.247 --> 00:24.280
I was sick
of fighting with Matty.

00:24.282 --> 00:25.048
Why couldn't we move on?

00:25.050 --> 00:28.418
Why was I letting Matty McKibben
ruin another night?

00:28.420 --> 00:29.485
I had a new man in my life,

00:29.487 --> 00:33.056
and he and a drama-free night
were just 40 minutes away.

00:33.058 --> 00:35.625
Turn the car around.
Not going down like this.

00:35.627 --> 00:37.060
We can still
make it to SCU by midnight

00:37.062 --> 00:40.029
and spend our night
with real men, college men.

00:40.031 --> 00:41.864
Who's down
for a little road trip?

00:41.866 --> 00:42.799
- Hell to the yes.

00:42.801 --> 00:44.967
They say the best way to get
over someone--

00:44.969 --> 00:46.069
that someone being Jake--

00:46.071 --> 00:47.470
is to get under someone new.

00:47.472 --> 00:50.540
And that someone new is
a yet-to-be-named college guy--

00:50.542 --> 00:51.240
or guys--

00:51.242 --> 00:53.876
with their manly scruff
and five-button cardigans.

00:53.878 --> 00:54.510
Every one of them

00:54.512 --> 00:57.146
is like a living, breathing
J.Crew catalog, only hotter.

00:57.148 --> 00:59.916
Let's frickin' do this.
- Let's frickin' do this.

00:59.918 --> 01:01.551
- Let's frickin' not!

01:01.553 --> 01:03.553
I need you
to take me home, pronto.

01:03.555 --> 01:05.288
The only thing worse
than getting dumped

01:05.290 --> 01:09.358
is an "Eat, Pray, Suck"
road trip with you two morons.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.828
Good luck with "Crossroads 2."

01:11.830 --> 01:12.595
- What did Sadie know?

01:12.597 --> 01:15.264
- <i>Crossroads</i>
is an underappreciated gem.

01:15.266 --> 01:15.965
And Luke and his bed

01:15.967 --> 01:19.202
would be the perfect remedy
to everything.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.537
Surprise!

01:24.041 --> 01:27.810
[keys clacking, loud thud]

01:27.812 --> 01:28.811
I couldn't believe it.

01:28.813 --> 01:30.346
Was Luke really cheating on me?

01:30.348 --> 01:32.915
I wanted to speak,
but I couldn't form words.

01:32.917 --> 01:34.617
Lucky for me,
I had a best friend

01:34.619 --> 01:36.052
who was never
at a loss for them.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.920
- W.T.F.?
A rub and tug with a fug?

01:37.922 --> 01:42.658
The only ending you're getting
tonight is an unhappy one.

01:42.660 --> 01:43.292
And you?

01:43.294 --> 01:45.061
I may look
like a delicate flower,

01:45.063 --> 01:46.195
but I am a million-dollar baby.

01:46.197 --> 01:49.565
I will grab that messy mop
and pull so hard,

01:49.567 --> 01:52.368
you'll have to go
to every supercuts from here

01:52.370 --> 01:53.536
to Oakland to re-create

01:53.538 --> 01:56.072
that "oh, I just rolled
out of bed looking like this,

01:56.074 --> 01:57.874
let me give you
a sensual massage" look.

01:57.876 --> 01:59.876
So put 'em up,
'cause it's go time, bitch.

01:59.878 --> 02:04.680
- Jenna, I'd like you to meet
my best friend, Shayne.

02:04.682 --> 02:06.783
- Hi.
I'm Shayne.

02:06.785 --> 02:09.352
By the way, I'm gay.

02:11.522 --> 02:12.188
- Gay or straight?

02:12.190 --> 02:15.424
- Don't worry. My brother's been
through this a thousand times.

02:15.426 --> 02:16.259
They hold us for a night,

02:16.261 --> 02:18.294
then we're brought
before a judge in the morning.

02:18.296 --> 02:20.363
We will be out after that.

02:20.365 --> 02:21.731
- Okay, right.

02:21.733 --> 02:22.632
- What's the matter?

02:22.634 --> 02:24.300
You can't do a night
in the clink, bro?

02:24.302 --> 02:25.334
- Oh, no, it's not that.

02:25.336 --> 02:26.502
I had a ton of beer back there.

02:26.504 --> 02:28.371
I got to go to the bathroom
really bad.

02:28.373 --> 02:30.006
- They have toilets inside.

02:30.008 --> 02:31.440
- You know I'm pee shy dude.

02:31.442 --> 02:32.909
- Gay or straight?
- Straight.

02:32.911 --> 02:35.611
- Hey, what are we going to say?
- We're straight.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.980
- Yeah, but what
if the gay wing is nicer?

02:37.982 --> 02:39.749
[door closes]

02:42.352 --> 02:44.353
- Gay or straight?

02:44.355 --> 02:45.488
- Straight.

02:45.490 --> 02:48.991
- Wait. Why would you
ask me that and not him?

02:48.993 --> 02:50.359
- [chuckles]

02:50.361 --> 02:52.862
[door slams]

02:52.864 --> 02:56.098
[ominous music plays]

02:56.100 --> 03:03.072
â™ª

03:03.074 --> 03:05.508
don't we get one phone call?

03:05.510 --> 03:09.111
- Yeah, we do.

03:11.481 --> 03:12.782
- How's this thing work?

03:12.784 --> 03:14.050
Do we need wooden nickels
or something?

03:14.052 --> 03:17.520
- It's like that gumball
machine, but no, uh, coins.

03:17.522 --> 03:19.088
Collect calls only.

03:19.090 --> 03:20.122
- Okay, whatever.

03:20.124 --> 03:23.626
Whose number do
we know by heart?

03:23.628 --> 03:24.727
What about Jenna?

03:24.729 --> 03:26.128
You have to have
her number memorized.

03:26.130 --> 03:29.532
- I'd rather die in prison
than call Jenna right now.

03:29.534 --> 03:30.433
- Come on, man.

03:30.435 --> 03:34.770
There's got to be someone else
whose number we have memorized.

03:36.139 --> 03:38.975
[phone beeps]

03:38.977 --> 03:41.711
[phone vibrates]

03:41.713 --> 03:42.278
- Hello?

03:42.280 --> 03:45.748
- Hello, this is a collect call
from the county prison.

03:45.750 --> 03:46.782
- Not tonight, Ally.

03:46.784 --> 03:50.219
Get out of another drunk-driving
sitch yourself.

03:50.221 --> 03:52.655
[dial tone]

03:56.894 --> 03:58.728
- Yo.

03:59.863 --> 04:01.364
- Holy [bleep], you escaped?

04:01.366 --> 04:03.566
Do you know how much trouble
you're in now?

04:03.568 --> 04:04.567
- What are you talking about?

04:04.569 --> 04:06.836
I just wanted to remind you
before the Vikes hit the Zinny

04:06.838 --> 04:10.339
that I got a girls' brunch
with Val and Lacey tomorrow.

04:10.341 --> 04:12.074
Weirdo.

04:16.613 --> 04:18.547
[phone beeps]

04:18.549 --> 04:21.250
[phone rings]

04:22.052 --> 04:24.020
- I'm sorry to just barge in.

04:24.022 --> 04:26.322
I was just missing you.
- No sweat.

04:26.324 --> 04:29.525
It can be a little hectic
around here during midterms.

04:29.527 --> 04:31.928
- "Hectic"
didn't capture the real.

04:31.930 --> 04:33.930
It was
a full-on sensory assault,

04:33.932 --> 04:36.799
a revolting blend
of stank, rank, and jank.

04:36.801 --> 04:39.335
- Desperate times
equals desperate measures,

04:39.337 --> 04:41.737
which equals Tamara
digging for treasure

04:41.739 --> 04:45.942
in this filthy heap
of boy scuzz.

04:47.744 --> 04:50.346
Hey, there.
I'm Tamara.

04:50.348 --> 04:52.515
- [belches]

04:52.517 --> 04:54.684
- Not sure that was the heat
Tamara had in mind

04:54.686 --> 04:56.886
when she pledged
to hook up with a college guy.

04:56.888 --> 04:58.454
- O.M. Jesus,
I need to scrub

04:58.456 --> 05:00.623
a "tuna fish, root beer,
and corn chip" burp

05:00.625 --> 05:01.891
off my face, stat!

05:01.893 --> 05:03.993
- Bathroom's down the hall
to the--

05:03.995 --> 05:05.695
it's coed!

05:10.233 --> 05:10.933
Hey.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.768
I'm sorry.
I really have to study.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.171
- Luke was proving difficult
to pin down.

05:15.173 --> 05:20.209
Maybe I just needed to get a bit
more creative in my approach.

05:20.211 --> 05:21.310
- What are you doing?

05:21.312 --> 05:22.144
- How about I quiz you,

05:22.146 --> 05:27.450
and for every right answer,
you get a reward.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.451
- Okay.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.753
- "The end
of the Neutrality Act

05:30.755 --> 05:34.657
came with the passage
of this law in 1941."

05:34.659 --> 05:36.692
- The Lease Lend Act.

05:36.694 --> 05:37.560
- Yes.

05:37.562 --> 05:38.594
- Wait.
No, I mislabeled it.

05:38.596 --> 05:40.830
I think it's the Lend Lease Act,
I'm pretty sure.

05:40.832 --> 05:42.832
Can I see it?

05:42.834 --> 05:44.333
Yep.

05:44.335 --> 05:48.637
[hip hop music]

05:48.639 --> 05:51.307
[toilet flushes]

05:53.343 --> 05:55.711
- I can't do this.

05:55.713 --> 05:56.445
- I can't do this.

05:56.447 --> 05:59.348
- Go. I'll form a human shield.
- No, it's not that.

05:59.350 --> 06:01.984
- Then what?
- My...

06:01.986 --> 06:02.551
"Situation"...

06:02.553 --> 06:04.820
Has graduated
from a stand-up job

06:04.822 --> 06:06.355
to a sit-down one.

06:06.357 --> 06:07.456
- Eesh.

06:07.458 --> 06:10.559
[prison cell door closes]
Good luck with that.

06:10.561 --> 06:12.728
[buzzer sounds]

06:13.296 --> 06:16.365
Uh, hey, that's my bunk.

06:17.501 --> 06:22.538
Hey, man,
I was assigned that bunk, so...

06:23.273 --> 06:26.976
Wha--oh! Um,
I'll go up in...Here.

06:38.422 --> 06:39.188
- With Luke distracted,

06:39.190 --> 06:41.791
I thought a nice view
and some fresh air

06:41.793 --> 06:43.692
would help us reconnect.

06:43.694 --> 06:45.394
Isn't it nice?

06:45.396 --> 06:49.131
Plus, it doesn't smell
like coffee and Ritalin up here.

06:49.133 --> 06:51.434
- [chuckles]
Totally.

06:51.436 --> 06:53.335
- Ugh.
Seriously?

06:53.337 --> 06:54.437
- All right, let's--Jenna, no!

06:54.439 --> 06:57.840
- What?
It's just a nasty old flip-flop.

06:57.842 --> 06:59.442
- That was the doorstop.

06:59.444 --> 07:01.577
It keeps the door from closing.

07:01.579 --> 07:02.344
I don't have my phone.

07:02.346 --> 07:04.680
Can you call Tamara
and get her to come get us?

07:04.682 --> 07:06.749
- I left my phone downstairs.

07:06.751 --> 07:10.152
- Great.
Now we're locked out here.

07:13.557 --> 07:14.890
- My effort to connect with Luke

07:14.892 --> 07:16.725
had left us locked out
in the cold.

07:16.727 --> 07:19.228
I needed to generate some heat
and fast.

07:19.230 --> 07:19.762
- [sighs]

07:19.764 --> 07:21.564
- Well, while
we're stuck out here,

07:21.566 --> 07:23.899
we might as well
make the most of it.

07:23.901 --> 07:24.867
Hmm?

07:24.869 --> 07:26.635
- [sighs]

07:26.637 --> 07:28.704
- Hey.
Hey, what's wrong?

07:28.706 --> 07:30.239
- Jenna,
you just don't understand

07:30.241 --> 07:31.474
how important my studying is.

07:31.476 --> 07:33.709
You're still in high school.

07:33.711 --> 07:34.677
- What does that mean?

07:34.679 --> 07:36.612
- Look, that
didn't come out right.

07:36.614 --> 07:38.280
- No, Luke, why don't you
tell me what else

07:38.282 --> 07:42.485
I don't understand
because I'm just in high school.

07:42.487 --> 07:45.087
- Ugh.

07:45.089 --> 07:47.556
Ugh.

07:56.166 --> 07:58.501
[sighs]

07:58.503 --> 07:59.235
Ah.

07:59.237 --> 08:00.136
- Wait your turn, son.

08:00.138 --> 08:03.072
I got a few pounds
to drop in here.

08:07.477 --> 08:09.411
- Oh!

08:09.413 --> 08:10.746
Oh!

08:10.748 --> 08:11.947
- Word to the wise--

08:11.949 --> 08:14.049
you might want to think
about keeping an eye

08:14.051 --> 08:15.184
on your boy tonight.

08:15.186 --> 08:16.952
He ain't making no friends.

08:16.954 --> 08:17.686
- Thanks.

08:17.688 --> 08:19.622
- What you in for, homes?

08:19.624 --> 08:21.991
- Who knows?
You?

08:21.993 --> 08:25.928
- Pulled a trigger,
made some things disappear.

08:25.930 --> 08:28.864
Normally,
I'm one easygoing mother.

08:28.866 --> 08:30.933
But if someone gets
on my nerves,

08:30.935 --> 08:32.935
look the hell out!

08:32.937 --> 08:34.970
Believe it or not...

08:34.972 --> 08:37.940
My troubles began
when I was younger than you.

08:37.942 --> 08:40.910
[buzzer sounds]

08:40.912 --> 08:41.911
- Oh, hey.

08:41.913 --> 08:44.446
Doing your nails--
nice.

08:44.448 --> 08:46.282
You know,
when you think about it,

08:46.284 --> 08:49.485
there is no more important part
of a lesbian than her fingers.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.388
- Do you just blurt out every
offensive thing that you think?

08:52.390 --> 08:55.024
- No. It's actually
very careful curated.

08:55.026 --> 08:56.525
Why aren't you studying
for midterms

08:56.527 --> 08:59.962
like all the other cockroaches
in this godforsaken hellhole?

08:59.964 --> 09:02.932
- Because I finished them
last night, duh.

09:02.934 --> 09:04.433
Boys--not only
are they unsanitary,

09:04.435 --> 09:07.236
but they don't know the first
thing about managing their time.

09:07.238 --> 09:09.538
- [gasps]
Oh, my God.

09:09.540 --> 09:09.939
Exactly.

09:09.941 --> 09:12.575
I am all about managing time
appropriately,

09:12.577 --> 09:13.375
especially for senior year.

09:13.377 --> 09:16.078
My color-coded system to get me
through the next few months

09:16.080 --> 09:16.779
would blow your mind.

09:16.781 --> 09:20.316
- Really? 'Cause I'm the girl
who goes to Staples to unwind.

09:20.318 --> 09:23.018
- Oh, my God. Don't even talk
to me about how much money

09:23.020 --> 09:25.854
I spent at Staples last week.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.390
Hold up.
Is that caramel spell?

09:28.392 --> 09:29.692
- Obvi.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.094
- Scooch over, girl.

09:32.096 --> 09:32.528
- Hey.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.597
I didn't mean
that you don't understand

09:34.599 --> 09:37.933
because you're still
in high school.

09:37.935 --> 09:39.835
I just--
[sighs]

09:39.837 --> 09:40.569
I'm on scholarship here.

09:40.571 --> 09:44.406
And if I don't make my grades,
I'll lose it, and then I'm out.

09:44.408 --> 09:47.243
There's no way I can afford
this place otherwise.

09:47.245 --> 09:50.412
So midterms are
an extra-stressful time of year

09:50.414 --> 09:52.681
for me.

09:52.683 --> 09:55.050
- I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

09:55.052 --> 09:55.985
- I wanted to tell you.

09:55.987 --> 09:58.120
I just know you maybe
have this picture of me

09:58.122 --> 10:01.657
as this cool, confident
college guy, which I am.

10:01.659 --> 10:04.293
I totally am, like, all day.
- Right.

10:04.295 --> 10:07.997
- But I'm also a complete
dorkus about school.

10:07.999 --> 10:09.898
I put myself
on lockdown this weekend

10:09.900 --> 10:11.367
so I could
get everything done

10:11.369 --> 10:15.237
and make time for the important
things in my life...

10:15.239 --> 10:15.804
Like you.

10:15.806 --> 10:18.107
- In that moment,
Luke was everything--

10:18.109 --> 10:21.076
his vulnerability,
his honesty, his work ethic,

10:21.078 --> 10:23.345
no games,
straight lines.

10:23.347 --> 10:24.213
He was a great boyfriend,

10:24.215 --> 10:27.583
and I wanted to be
an equally great girlfriend.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.083
Okay.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.585
If you need to keep
this scholarship,

10:29.587 --> 10:31.954
then we need
to get down to brass tacks.

10:31.956 --> 10:33.289
Hand me those flash cards.

10:33.291 --> 10:36.525
I am going
to lend-lease you a hand.

10:36.527 --> 10:38.427
- "Lend-lease"?
Really?

10:38.429 --> 10:41.797
- I regretted it
as soon as I said it.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.567
- My parents abandoned me.

10:45.569 --> 10:46.402
Trouble kept finding me.

10:46.404 --> 10:50.072
Soon, the streets
became my true Moms and Pops.

10:50.074 --> 10:52.141
I was raised
on the block, son.

10:52.143 --> 10:55.177
I got my PhD
in straight hustling, homey.

10:55.179 --> 10:57.346
- Yeah, I can relate, man.

10:57.348 --> 10:59.581
I just found out I was adopted.

10:59.583 --> 11:00.215
- Really?

11:00.217 --> 11:03.652
By some rich-bitch
mother[bleep] up in P.V.?

11:03.654 --> 11:04.853
- Yeah, but--

11:04.855 --> 11:06.822
- they fed you,
bought you clothes?

11:06.824 --> 11:08.023
- They did, but--

11:08.025 --> 11:10.526
- what kind of car you drive?

11:10.528 --> 11:12.194
- Escalade.

11:12.196 --> 11:13.429
Drove it off a cliff.

11:13.431 --> 11:15.964
- [laughs]
An Escalade?

11:15.966 --> 11:16.532
Damn, son.

11:16.534 --> 11:17.966
They ain't even
have the courtesy

11:17.968 --> 11:20.769
to buy their adopted boy
an "S" class.

11:20.771 --> 11:25.908
Homey, you got adopted
by some straight jerks.

11:25.910 --> 11:29.411
[laughing]

11:29.413 --> 11:31.547
"Drove it off a cliff."

11:31.549 --> 11:34.616
[chuckling]

11:35.418 --> 11:35.951
- Come on, Luke.

11:35.953 --> 11:38.721
What were the main points
of the Potsdam Treaty?

11:38.723 --> 11:42.991
- I think it was...

11:44.127 --> 11:46.061
- I thought you had to study.

11:46.063 --> 11:49.031
- I think we've studied enough
for the night.

11:49.033 --> 11:52.167
I just want to enjoy you.

11:54.003 --> 11:55.137
- I came here tonight
to hook up,

11:55.139 --> 11:57.873
but it's been
a complete fail Mary.

11:57.875 --> 11:58.507
What's the deal?

11:58.509 --> 12:00.776
I thought college guys were
supposed to be so much cooler,

12:00.778 --> 12:02.678
but they're
just like high-school guys,

12:02.680 --> 12:04.480
plus 2 years and 20 pounds.

12:04.482 --> 12:05.781
- I did the guy thing
for a while,

12:05.783 --> 12:09.084
but it wasn't until I was with
a woman that everything clicked.

12:09.086 --> 12:11.487
I mean, guys just take
so much longer to evolve

12:11.489 --> 12:12.154
into functional adults.

12:12.156 --> 12:14.390
And the road to get there
is filled with douche stops.

12:14.392 --> 12:16.258
- Oh, talk to me
about douche stops.

12:16.260 --> 12:20.028
My last boyfriend went into
a "Mumford and Dumbs" phase.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.598
So "trajnoxious."

12:22.600 --> 12:24.199
"Tragic" plus "obnoxious."

12:24.201 --> 12:24.900
- That sounds horrible.

12:24.902 --> 12:27.469
- Not to mention
he could never buy me a ticket

12:27.471 --> 12:29.705
to ride
the big oh-llercoaster.

12:29.707 --> 12:30.973
- You know what they say.

12:30.975 --> 12:33.742
Never send a man
to do a woman's job.

12:33.744 --> 12:35.711
[both laugh]

12:35.713 --> 12:37.479
- Okay, I need to stop
or get a towel

12:37.481 --> 12:41.784
for the serious verbal vom
that's happening right now.

12:41.786 --> 12:43.318
Nice, huh?

12:48.191 --> 12:49.992
- Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

12:49.994 --> 12:52.327
I totally misread the situation.

12:52.329 --> 12:55.664
- Let's do this.

13:06.609 --> 13:09.878
- Hey.

13:13.049 --> 13:14.650
Freedom.

13:14.652 --> 13:16.718
- â™ª Right now
we've only just begun â™ª

13:16.720 --> 13:20.856
â™ª open up your eyes and see

13:20.858 --> 13:21.523
â™ª

13:21.525 --> 13:24.059
- ugh. Shayne, you've got
to stop hooking up

13:24.061 --> 13:26.395
with girls in my bed.

13:26.397 --> 13:27.596
- Good morning.

13:27.598 --> 13:30.666
- Oh, my God.

13:30.668 --> 13:32.901
- Walker, you have a visitor.

13:32.903 --> 13:34.703
- That's you.

13:34.705 --> 13:36.104
Let me go.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.339
- Are you insane?

13:37.341 --> 13:38.207
- This might be my one shot

13:38.209 --> 13:41.009
at getting
to an actual bathroom, man.

13:41.011 --> 13:42.144
- Fine.

13:42.146 --> 13:46.882
But whoever it is,
you get us out of here.

13:46.884 --> 13:48.817
- I'm Walker.

13:54.190 --> 13:56.792
Is there
a real bathroom anywhere?

13:56.794 --> 14:00.796
Even a plastic bag
would do at this point.

14:02.866 --> 14:04.433
Sadie, how did you find us?

14:04.435 --> 14:07.703
- I was there when Matty got
his fake last night, dickweed.

14:07.705 --> 14:08.604
And since you left with Eva,

14:08.606 --> 14:10.506
I figured you were dead
or in prison.

14:10.508 --> 14:12.774
Oh, and the recorded call
from county helped.

14:12.776 --> 14:14.810
Now, what the [bleep]
happened to you?

14:14.812 --> 14:16.478
- Matty and I got busted
for drinking.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.914
We showed the cops our fakes,
and they bought them,

14:18.916 --> 14:20.582
but then Matty
started mouthing off,

14:20.584 --> 14:22.985
so he got us arrested
for open containers.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.986
- Where was Eva?

14:23.988 --> 14:25.888
- I don't know.
She was there, but she bailed.

14:25.890 --> 14:27.589
- That bitch ditched?

14:27.591 --> 14:30.158
I'm going to [bleep] kill her.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.059
Oh, relax.

14:31.061 --> 14:33.996
- Sadie, if I don't get
out of here soon,

14:33.998 --> 14:36.632
I'm gonna do something
really bad.

14:36.634 --> 14:38.834
- You're gonna hurt someone?

14:38.836 --> 14:39.735
- No.

14:39.737 --> 14:43.105
I'm gonna [bleep] myself.

14:43.107 --> 14:45.440
- Listen, dumb-ass,
give up your fakes,

14:45.442 --> 14:46.308
tell the cops you're minors,

14:46.310 --> 14:48.010
and legally,
they can't hold you.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.646
If they even hesitate,
tell them that your friend

14:50.648 --> 14:52.447
is going to tweet
at <i>The L.A. Times</i>

14:52.449 --> 14:54.383
that their incompetence
is endangering the lives

14:54.385 --> 14:57.252
of two cute, innocent
high-school boys,

14:57.254 --> 15:00.856
and it'll go viral
faster than HPV at Coachella.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.158
And they'll be mall cops
at the Beverly Center

15:03.160 --> 15:06.194
for the rest
of their meaningless lives.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.162
- Whoa.

15:07.164 --> 15:07.696
Okay.

15:07.698 --> 15:08.931
- With processing
and everything,

15:08.933 --> 15:10.899
you should be out in an hour.
- Thank you.

15:10.901 --> 15:13.235
Oh, hey, wait.
How do you know all this stuff?

15:13.237 --> 15:16.505
- <i>Orange Is the New Black.</i>
- Hmm.

15:16.507 --> 15:21.643
- And the next thing you know,
we were breast friends...

15:21.645 --> 15:23.478
Hands everywhere.

15:23.480 --> 15:24.212
I think we had sex--

15:24.214 --> 15:26.315
not 100% sure, but I did
feel, like, 1,000 volts

15:26.317 --> 15:27.950
shoot through my thighs
at one point,

15:27.952 --> 15:29.318
and my eyes rolled back
into my head,

15:29.320 --> 15:32.421
and the orgasms just kept
coming, fast and bi-furious.

15:32.423 --> 15:35.524
I swear I saw Jesus
surfing a rainbow-colored star.

15:35.526 --> 15:37.960
- So does this mean you're--
- "heteroflexible"?

15:37.962 --> 15:40.629
Maybe, though I think
it's more like that time

15:40.631 --> 15:42.698
I wore a blazer around
for a week.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.434
Looks good on Ellen,
but not for me.

15:45.436 --> 15:47.035
- And when Mom
was over in Seattle,

15:47.037 --> 15:48.136
she moved down here
with Sonic Youth,

15:48.138 --> 15:51.106
so there's, like, a 65% chance
I'm Eddie Vedder's kid.

15:51.108 --> 15:52.507
And then there was
that brief period

15:52.509 --> 15:55.377
that Kurt and Courtney
broke up, so...

15:55.379 --> 15:56.445
- No.
- Yeah.

15:56.447 --> 15:57.479
- Get out of my face.

15:57.481 --> 16:01.149
- Kurt Fuller and Courtney Cox
might be your parents?

16:01.151 --> 16:01.583
So cool.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.785
- I was almost the kid
on the cover of <i>Nevermind,</i>

16:03.787 --> 16:07.222
but my mother's
a very private person.

16:07.224 --> 16:09.324
- [clears throat]

16:09.326 --> 16:11.960
- Hi, kids.
How was your night?

16:11.962 --> 16:13.629
- Nothing too crazy--

16:13.631 --> 16:15.597
concert and then
right back to Tamara's.

16:15.599 --> 16:18.900
- Okay, don't worry.
I am off the clock.

16:18.902 --> 16:21.403
There is no need
to censor yourself.

16:21.405 --> 16:24.339
I'm not Counselor Marks
in your home.

16:24.341 --> 16:27.142
I am just Val the pal.

16:27.144 --> 16:28.810
- Eva, what's up?

16:28.812 --> 16:30.979
- Oh, my God.
I'm so glad to see you.

16:30.981 --> 16:31.913
I really need to talk.

16:31.915 --> 16:34.883
Lacey said I should just
hang out until you got home.

16:34.885 --> 16:37.185
- Lacey.
- Hmm.

16:37.187 --> 16:41.089
- Why don't we go talk
in my room?

16:41.091 --> 16:42.457
- Sit, spill.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.192
How was the concert?
Any highlights?

16:44.194 --> 16:47.863
- Just the ones slipping
through my fingers this morning.

16:47.865 --> 16:49.765
- Do tell.

16:49.767 --> 16:52.834
- Lesbi honest.
I kissed a girl.

16:52.836 --> 16:53.969
- Whoa!

16:53.971 --> 16:54.803
- Boom!

16:54.805 --> 16:56.238
- Bi-curious George.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.239
- Interesting.

16:57.241 --> 17:01.076
Well, that's a thing that--
that some people do.

17:01.078 --> 17:01.677
- Oh, please.

17:01.679 --> 17:04.646
Once you've knocked a few back,
a mouth is just a mouth.

17:04.648 --> 17:09.184
- Well, I could never do that
with a girl.

17:09.186 --> 17:10.185
- Oh, really?

17:10.187 --> 17:13.922
Newport beach, junior year?

17:14.557 --> 17:16.024
That wasn't Kevin, hon.

17:16.026 --> 17:19.327
- Oh, my God!
[gasps]

17:19.329 --> 17:20.495
- They're in jail?

17:20.497 --> 17:22.364
- I know, and I totally
would have stuck around,

17:22.366 --> 17:24.700
but after my shoplifting thing
last year,

17:24.702 --> 17:27.002
my Dad would have frozen
my trust.

17:27.004 --> 17:27.669
- Okay, this is insane.

17:27.671 --> 17:30.038
- I was hoping you could go down
to the station with me

17:30.040 --> 17:30.972
and help get them out.

17:30.974 --> 17:32.908
- Matty's
self-destructive streak

17:32.910 --> 17:33.775
had hit an all-time high.

17:33.777 --> 17:36.678
But it wasn't my responsibility
to be his savior anymore.

17:36.680 --> 17:37.946
I'm gonna give you
his brother's number.

17:37.948 --> 17:42.884
Call him. He'll know exactly
how to handle this situation.

17:46.556 --> 17:48.523
[buzzer sounds]

17:48.525 --> 17:49.758
- Hey, all we have to do

17:49.760 --> 17:51.560
is tell them we're minors,
and they'll let us go.

17:51.562 --> 17:53.829
- But if we say that,
they'll know we had fake I.Ds.

17:53.831 --> 17:55.764
- Ugh.
We will deal with that later.

17:55.766 --> 17:58.667
All I know is that this place
will be painted brown

17:58.669 --> 18:00.035
if we don't get
out of here right now.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.171
So let's go.
- Okay, okay.

18:03.173 --> 18:03.739
Uh...

18:03.741 --> 18:06.875
Yo, Jordan,
uh, we're getting out, man.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.277
- Beat the rap.
Enjoy it, son.

18:09.279 --> 18:10.112
- Thank you so much,

18:10.114 --> 18:12.647
and I learned a lot
hearing about your struggles.

18:12.649 --> 18:14.983
You know,
if I can ever do something

18:14.985 --> 18:15.851
to help you get out of here.

18:15.853 --> 18:18.620
Maybe put you in touch
with some good attorneys...

18:18.622 --> 18:21.123
- Attorneys?
Dude, I <i>am</i> an attorney.

18:21.125 --> 18:24.126
- You are?
- Stanford, class of '02.

18:24.128 --> 18:27.062
- And you killed a man?

18:27.064 --> 18:29.931
- What the [bleep]
are you talking about?

18:29.933 --> 18:31.333
- Uh, you--
you pulled a trigger.

18:31.335 --> 18:32.801
You made some things
disappear.

18:32.803 --> 18:34.603
- Yeah, I work
in an investment bank.

18:34.605 --> 18:37.072
I shorted some securities
that I couldn't cover,

18:37.074 --> 18:40.208
and then I made
the transaction disappear.

18:40.210 --> 18:40.742
- Oh.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.711
- Now I'm gonna [bleep]
you up!

18:42.713 --> 18:44.713
- We're minors!
We're minors!

18:44.715 --> 18:48.116
- And I really have to go
to the bathroom!

18:48.118 --> 18:49.417
- Choices--

18:49.419 --> 18:50.685
sometimes you need
to make the hard choice

18:50.687 --> 18:53.221
to cut someone out of your life,
or else you won't be open

18:53.223 --> 18:58.160
to the possibility of someone
new and amazing coming into it.

18:58.162 --> 19:00.862
- Feel better?
- Oh, much better.

19:00.864 --> 19:02.297
I can't wait to get home,
though.

19:02.299 --> 19:04.266
I'm exhausted.
- Me too.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.700
- Are you going back home?

19:05.702 --> 19:10.038
- Yeah, I guess.
There's worse places, you know.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.840
- Mm.

19:13.676 --> 19:15.510
- I'm so glad you guys
are okay.

19:15.512 --> 19:17.846
- Eva, what the [bleep]?
You totally bailed on us.

19:17.848 --> 19:21.817
- Hey, hey, hey,
let me handle this.

19:21.819 --> 19:22.684
So what happened back there?

19:22.686 --> 19:25.954
- Matty, I'm so sorry,
but I've been in trouble before,

19:25.956 --> 19:26.755
and if I mess up again,

19:26.757 --> 19:30.058
my Dad's sending me back
to New York, and my mother--

19:30.060 --> 19:34.362
so I went to find help.
I went to Jenna first and...

19:34.364 --> 19:34.830
- And?

19:34.832 --> 19:37.299
- Well, to be honest, Matty,
she was kind of rude.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.266
She said she couldn't help

19:38.268 --> 19:40.435
and that the person
that would know about jail

19:40.437 --> 19:43.004
was your drug addict brother.

19:43.006 --> 19:45.373
I'm sorry.
I came back here after

19:45.375 --> 19:47.442
and just trying to think
of something else,

19:47.444 --> 19:50.779
and I've just been waiting
for you.

19:50.781 --> 19:51.313
- Thank you.

19:51.315 --> 19:54.883
- It's been, like,
the worst first date ever,

19:54.885 --> 19:55.350
right?

19:55.352 --> 19:57.586
I didn't even get
a good-night kiss.

19:57.588 --> 19:59.487
- Yeah.

19:59.489 --> 20:03.024
What about a good-morning one?

20:07.230 --> 20:09.731
- What about a conjugal visit?

20:13.269 --> 20:14.002
- After that night,

20:14.004 --> 20:15.871
I knew if my head
was full of Matty McKibben,

20:15.873 --> 20:17.806
it would get in the way
of opening my heart to Luke,

20:17.808 --> 20:21.376
and I wasn't going to let
my Matty story, which was over,

20:21.378 --> 20:25.814
mess up my Luke story,
which was just beginning.

20:37.760 --> 20:38.894
- Next on <i>Awkward...</i>

20:38.896 --> 20:39.494
- This was it.

20:39.496 --> 20:41.029
Once I hit send,
there was no turning back.

20:41.031 --> 20:41.596
- Surprise.

20:41.598 --> 20:42.998
- Next fall I'd be starting
a whole new life.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.367
- Is there a reason why
you haven't sent me my essay?

20:45.369 --> 20:46.534
- Matty, if you want
your essay so bad,

20:46.536 --> 20:48.570
why don't you go
and get it yourself?

20:48.572 --> 20:49.738
- Whew! Got it.

20:49.740 --> 20:51.673
- You promised me dessert.

20:51.675 --> 20:53.174
- Skanky jank!

20:53.176 --> 20:55.677
- Not mine.

20:55.679 --> 20:57.012
Eva's?
