and his shirt.

09:12.570 --> 09:14.105
Well, how'd the blood
get back there?

09:14.138 --> 09:16.408
Not blood...
bovine myoglobin.

09:16.441 --> 09:18.610
It comes from beef that's
already been drained of blood.

09:18.643 --> 09:22.414
I analyzed those droplets,
and the size and shape indicate

09:22.448 --> 09:25.851
that they could have come
from a... a cutting saw.

09:27.151 --> 09:28.753
So Holtz could have been
in a butcher shop

09:28.786 --> 09:30.555

something like that?

09:30.589 --> 09:31.791

Jane, if you want

you have to be at your best,

Maura just said that, uh...

11:45.530 --> 11:48.767

Yeah.

12:27.673 --> 12:31.376
Uh, when the drug-unit guys
were following Holtz,

12:31.410 --> 12:33.112
he would stop every day for a bagel

12:33.145 --> 12:37.183
at the same place on East Concord.
"Newsom's."

I'm curious, though.
You had a successful drug network

under the radar for years.

14:38.917 --> 14:41.452
Why would you risk all of that
just to come after me?

14:41.485 --> 14:44.655

to examine your life.

I finally understood
that the path of my life

different if it weren't for you.

You dated a young woman

I was sorry for being a jerk.

something to her car?

23:44.774 --> 23:46.484
but she's my friend
and we work together.

23:46.517 --> 23:48.085
A million things could go wrong.

23:48.119 --> 23:49.621
So you're not even gonna try?

23:49.653 --> 23:52.089
<i>Look, maybe it works,
maybe it doesn't.</i>

23:52.123 --> 23:54.892
But if you don't take a risk,

23:54.926 --> 23:57.028
how the hell are you
ever gonna know?

23:57.061 --> 23:59.063
Ma.

23:59.095 --> 24:00.731
- What?
- Turn it up.

24:03.767 --> 24:07.004
<i>I don't know why Detective
Rizzoli continues to persecute me.</i>

24:07.037 --> 24:10.174
<i>I'm just thankful that justice
was done here today.</i>

24:10.208 --> 24:12.544
I really hate that bitch.

24:12.576 --> 24:15.913
<i>This whole affair calls Jane
Rizzoli's record into question.</i>

24:15.947 --> 24:18.483
<i>How many times has she
targeted innocent victims</i>

24:18.516 --> 24:19.651
<i>with her wild accusations?</i>

24:19.683 --> 24:21.685
<i>The Boston Police Department
needs to launch</i>

24:21.719 --> 24:24.855
<i>a full-scale investigation
of Detective Rizzoli.</i>

24:24.889 --> 24:27.025
Nobody's gonna buy that garbage.

24:27.057 --> 24:31.563
This woman has gone after
my home, my friends, my job.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.498
And now she's going
after my reputation?

24:33.530 --> 24:36.000
So what do you want to do?

24:37.034 --> 24:39.204
Keep digging.

24:39.237 --> 24:44.942
Okay, the only place that Alice
has made a real mistake is here.

24:44.976 --> 24:47.478
<i>Shooting of that state trooper
up in Maine?</i>

24:47.511 --> 24:49.814
Yeah, that's our best shot at
getting physical evidence against her.

24:49.846 --> 24:52.949
Well, they've kept me updated.

24:52.984 --> 24:55.653
<i>So far, no murder weapon
has been recovered.</i>

24:55.686 --> 24:58.756
They're still looking for the
gold Plymouth the shooter was in.

24:58.788 --> 25:03.828
And Alice's DNA could be in that
car, that would tie her to the murder.

25:03.861 --> 25:06.598
Troopers have not made much progress.

25:06.631 --> 25:08.999
Well, let's make it for them.

25:15.006 --> 25:16.975
[Groans]

25:17.007 --> 25:18.109
[Door opens]

25:18.142 --> 25:20.811
- [Sniffs] Hey.
- Oh, hey.

25:20.844 --> 25:22.713
- You look like you could use this.
- Oh.

25:22.747 --> 25:24.649
- You here all night?
- Yes.

25:24.681 --> 25:27.451
I have been just going over
every scrap of information we

25:27.452 --> 25:31.002
have on Alice Sands just hoping
to find something I missed.

25:31.622 --> 25:35.660
But, uh, I texted you because
of the accident investigation.

25:36.092 --> 25:40.832
- Did you look at Layla's notebook?
- I did, and you were right.

25:40.864 --> 25:42.866
The formulas that Layla calculated

25:42.900 --> 25:45.536
correspond almost exactly
to the crash data.

25:45.569 --> 25:47.304
So it wasn't an accident.

25:47.337 --> 25:50.941
Well, I built a reconstruction
scenario using the formulas

25:50.975 --> 25:53.844
- that you found in Layla's notebook.
- Mm-hmm.

25:53.878 --> 25:56.681
<i>Maura: The 54-mile-per-hour
speed she calculated combined</i>

25:56.713 --> 25:59.700
<i>with the friction value of
the road and the impact angle</i>

25:59.701 --> 26:02.687
<i>would create enough velocity
to break the guardrail.</i>

26:02.719 --> 26:05.789
There weren't skid marks
because she was accelerating.

26:05.823 --> 26:08.059
Well, there's no way
to tell for certain.

26:08.092 --> 26:11.595
Layla drove off that cliff and
made it look like an accident.

26:11.629 --> 26:13.698
She killed herself.

26:13.730 --> 26:16.867
That's one theory,
but none of this is conclusive.

26:16.901 --> 26:19.003
And, Frankie, there's no way
to truly know

26:19.036 --> 26:21.072
what was going on in Layla's mind.

26:21.104 --> 26:23.807
[Music]

26:23.841 --> 26:25.677
What if she never got to Route 16?

26:25.709 --> 26:28.613
What if she took, like, this road here?

26:28.645 --> 26:29.780
Well, the troopers searched

26:29.814 --> 26:32.683
these woods and this little lake.
Nothing.

26:32.717 --> 26:36.053
- Where does this one go?
- Looks like a dead end.

26:36.086 --> 26:38.589
[Sighs]
Okay.

26:38.623 --> 26:41.825
[Music]

26:48.699 --> 26:52.070
Yeah, it's just a dirt road. It
just ends in these woods right here.

26:52.103 --> 26:54.037
What is this?
This isn't on the map.

26:54.071 --> 26:56.741
Is that like... a crater or something?

26:56.774 --> 26:59.911
It's covered in vegetation.
It looks like an old quarry.

26:59.943 --> 27:02.680
- Did the troopers check it out?
- It's not in the notes.

27:02.712 --> 27:04.148
I'll get them to take a look.

27:09.987 --> 27:13.406
- There you are. I texted you.
- I'm sorry.

27:13.441 --> 27:15.026
I just needed
some time to figure this out.

27:15.058 --> 27:16.193
You talk to Maura?

27:16.227 --> 27:20.031
Yeah, it looks like Layla
crashed her car on purpose.

27:20.064 --> 27:25.103
There's no definitive proof,
but it might be a suicide.

27:25.135 --> 27:28.405
There is proof.
This is what I wanted to show you.

27:28.439 --> 27:30.307
See the reflector there
on the guardrail?

27:30.341 --> 27:31.709
Yeah.

27:31.741 --> 27:34.711
There shouldn't be any red
reflectors along that stretch of road.

27:34.745 --> 27:38.315
Department of Transit
only uses yellow reflectors.

27:38.348 --> 27:42.753
Layla put them there so
she'd know exactly where to hit.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.788
If the initial impact didn't kill her,

27:44.822 --> 27:47.191
the boulder at the bottom
definitely would.

27:50.294 --> 27:53.398
It's senseless.
S-she was just a kid.

27:53.430 --> 27:57.134
Hard to imagine things are so terrible
this seems like the only way out.

27:57.168 --> 28:00.405
Well, now I have to explain
all this to her parents.

28:00.438 --> 28:04.441
You can't explain...
maybe no one can.

28:04.475 --> 28:07.712
All you can do
is tell them the truth.

28:07.745 --> 28:10.715
You'll be fine.

28:16.453 --> 28:19.823
[Music]

28:21.257 --> 28:22.826
- I can't.
- Oh, yeah, yeah...

28:22.860 --> 28:24.803
I... I'm sorry.
Nina, don't...

28:26.396 --> 28:28.700
Oh, God.

28:30.555 --> 28:33.591
You got somebody watching the back?

28:33.623 --> 28:35.058
Okay, let me know if she moves.

28:35.092 --> 28:37.562
- You got Sands under surveillance?
- Mm-hmm.

28:37.594 --> 28:39.197
She's not getting away this time.

28:39.229 --> 28:42.165
Frankie, Mr. and Mrs. Jalbani are here.

28:42.199 --> 28:46.036
- They're downstairs.
- Okay. Thanks.

28:49.073 --> 28:51.542
Uh...

28:51.575 --> 28:53.510
[Grunts]
What's going on between you two?

28:53.544 --> 28:55.079
Nothing.

28:55.112 --> 28:58.082
- It sure felt like something.
- I'm just preoccupied.

29:00.584 --> 29:03.720
I'm trying to figure out how much
to tell Layla Jalbani's parents.

29:03.754 --> 29:05.957
- Do you know what happened?
- Yeah.

29:05.989 --> 29:07.959
The more I think about it,
the more pissed off I get.

29:07.991 --> 29:11.161
This bright, young girl
killed herself instead

29:11.194 --> 29:13.498
of admitting that she's
failing out of college.

29:13.530 --> 29:17.041
Even worse... she makes it look
like an accident so...

29:17.104 --> 29:19.637
her parents don't know that
they're the reason she did it.

29:19.670 --> 29:23.174
Okay, hold on.
You can't just blame the parents.

29:23.207 --> 29:26.844
Jane, they put a lot of pressure
on her to succeed.

29:26.876 --> 29:30.372
Frankie, it's never that simple.
[Elevator dings, doors open]

29:31.681 --> 29:33.550
All right. All right,
I appreciate it. Thank you.

29:33.584 --> 29:37.020
Jane, they found it.

29:37.054 --> 29:40.056
- Wha... The Plymouth?
- It was in the quarry.

29:40.090 --> 29:43.339
- Maine troopers found it under some trees.
- We got to get it to Maura.

29:43.340 --> 29:45.967
It's already handled.
It's on the way to her.

29:49.165 --> 29:53.770
Mr. and Mrs. Jalbani.
We've completed the investigation.

29:53.804 --> 29:55.773
And this mechanic...
have you arrested him?

29:55.805 --> 29:57.741
No, we didn't find any evidence

29:57.775 --> 29:59.610
that Layla's car
had been tampered with.

29:59.642 --> 30:01.312
<i>Then what happened?</i>

30:01.344 --> 30:03.280
W-Why was she even on
that terrible road?

30:03.314 --> 30:05.889
Please.

30:07.817 --> 30:11.821
The truth is Layla
was under a lot of stress.

30:11.854 --> 30:15.225
Did you know that she was failing
three classes at Pemberton?

30:15.258 --> 30:18.596
Failing?
Are you sure?

30:19.630 --> 30:21.799
She never said anything.

30:21.832 --> 30:23.301
Maybe she didn't want
to disappoint you.

30:23.334 --> 30:25.870
We could never be
disappointed in Layla.

30:25.902 --> 30:30.141
She was so much more than
we could have ever imagined.

30:30.173 --> 30:33.777
But failing would have been
devastating for her.

30:33.811 --> 30:38.015
<i>I mean, she pushed herself so hard.</i>

30:38.047 --> 30:40.317
You said that Layla
was gonna be the first one

30:40.351 --> 30:42.053
in your family to graduate college.

30:42.085 --> 30:43.921
- Mm-hmm.
- That she had a bright future.

30:43.953 --> 30:46.856
- Yes.
- That must have meant a lot to you?

30:46.890 --> 30:49.893
Yes, but, I mean,
it meant everything to Layla.

30:49.927 --> 30:51.728
<i>We knew that she was worried.</i>

30:51.761 --> 30:53.763
You know, we said,
"You come home.

30:53.796 --> 30:57.233
You go to the community college
for one year, two years."

30:57.267 --> 31:00.304
But Layla, she wouldn't hear of it.

31:00.336 --> 31:04.975
- She was determined to succeed.
- That sounds like...

31:05.008 --> 31:07.844
Layla put a lot of pressure on herself.

31:07.878 --> 31:10.582
Always.

31:12.048 --> 31:13.017
I don't understand.

31:13.049 --> 31:16.353
Did this have anything
to do with her crash?

31:16.386 --> 31:19.756
Uh, not... not directly.

31:22.026 --> 31:26.831
I guess it just might explain
why she was distracted that night.

31:26.863 --> 31:30.167
Actually, our...
our investigation determined

31:30.200 --> 31:35.773
that this... was nothing more
than a tragic accident.

31:37.908 --> 31:40.678
I'm so sorry for your loss.

31:46.249 --> 31:51.188
If there's anything else,
please don't hesitate to call.

<i>- Maura: I found another one.
- Jane: What... print?</i>

31:57.026 --> 32:00.097
Partial.
Probably not enough for an I.D.,

32:00.130 --> 32:02.999
but it is on top of
blood spatter from the trooper.

32:03.033 --> 32:07.805
Well, so, that puts Alice in the vehicle
when the trooper was shot.

32:07.837 --> 32:10.740
Well, only if we could positively
identify it as Alice's.

32:10.774 --> 32:14.210
- Maura.
- Kent. Swab the seatbelt clasp

32:14.244 --> 32:17.348
- and the glove-compartment handle for DNA.
- Got it.

32:17.381 --> 32:20.785
There's also a possibility
on the trunk-release latch.

32:20.817 --> 32:22.152
She torched the trunk.

32:22.186 --> 32:24.355
Yeah, well, DNA is resistant
to high temperatures.

32:24.388 --> 32:28.025
You know, Alice left
the police academy 20 years ago.

32:28.057 --> 32:30.361
We've come a long way since then.

- Maura, we got to convince a judge, okay?

A partial ain't gonna cut it.

32:58.421 --> 33:00.156
Well, not by themselves, maybe.

33:00.190 --> 33:04.094
But if we can put them together...

33:04.128 --> 33:07.198
- Like a puzzle.
- Exactly.

33:07.230 --> 33:11.134
I just hope we have enough pieces.

- We have a DNA match, too.

33:26.182 --> 33:28.084
Alice Sands definitely
touched that seatbelt.

33:28.117 --> 33:29.786
The evidence places her in the car.

33:29.819 --> 33:31.354
That'll tie her
to the trooper's murder.

33:31.388 --> 33:34.792

all I know how to do, okay?

35:35.931 --> 35:40.603
[Siren wails]
[Whimpers]

35:40.636 --> 35:42.305
Alice, please.

35:42.337 --> 35:44.373
Okay, we can still
walk out of here.

35:45.674 --> 35:47.611
It's over.

35:47.643 --> 35:49.478
[Wailing continues]

35:49.511 --> 35:52.348
Maybe, but I'll still win.

35:52.381 --> 35:57.488
Because after you kill me, everyone
will think you're a dirty cop.

35:58.821 --> 36:03.226
"Did Jane Rizzoli really kill
that poor woman in cold blood?"

36:03.259 --> 36:05.661
<i>You won't be so perfect then.</i>

36:05.694 --> 36:08.598
I'm not gonna shoot you.

36:13.402 --> 36:14.937
I'm not gonna shoot you.

36:14.971 --> 36:17.407
I'm not gonna give you the choice.

36:19.576 --> 36:20.744
No!

[Gunshots]

Come on.</i>

36:44.767 --> 36:46.370
Jane?

36:49.705 --> 36:50.940
Jane, you okay?

36:50.973 --> 36:52.209
- You're good.
- Yeah...

36:52.241 --> 36:54.811
- It's okay. You okay?
- Yeah.

36:54.843 --> 36:56.679
- You good?
- Yeah.

37:14.397 --> 37:16.466
<i>This stool taken?</i>

37:16.498 --> 37:21.571
- Why? You want to throw it at me?
- I want to apologize.

37:21.603 --> 37:23.973
No, I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

37:24.006 --> 37:25.975
I completely misread things,

37:26.009 --> 37:30.013
- probably screwed up our friendship.
- Frankie, stop.

37:30.046 --> 37:32.314
I freaked out a little.
That's all.

37:32.348 --> 37:36.518
See, I hate that I put you
in that position.

37:36.551 --> 37:40.422
Since Marcus died,
I've been on my own.

37:40.455 --> 37:42.024
That was my first kiss.

37:42.058 --> 37:46.396
I should have known that.
Aw, I'm such an idiot.

37:46.428 --> 37:48.864
No, I'm sorry.

37:48.897 --> 37:52.768
Don't worry.
It will never happen again.

37:52.801 --> 37:54.937
I didn't say that.

37:54.971 --> 37:57.674
[Music]

38:05.781 --> 38:08.350
Wow.

38:08.384 --> 38:09.953
[Both chuckle]

38:09.986 --> 38:11.421
That happened.

38:11.453 --> 38:13.489
[Clears throat]
Um...

38:13.522 --> 38:15.624
Well, I... I think I should
buy you a drink.

38:15.658 --> 38:18.428
- I think you better, after that.
- Yeah.

38:20.062 --> 38:22.031
[Clears throat]

38:22.064 --> 38:25.034
[Music]

38:25.067 --> 38:26.969
Okay.

38:27.002 --> 38:31.040
- That's all of it.
- Much better.

38:31.073 --> 38:33.709
- Now it feels like a real home.
- Yeah.

38:33.743 --> 38:36.313
Maybe we could move this
and give you some more room.

38:36.346 --> 38:39.381
- What's in it?
- No idea.

38:39.415 --> 38:43.953
- Ooh, interesting.
- What?

38:43.986 --> 38:45.622
It's a torture device.

38:45.654 --> 38:47.457
- You want me to show you how it works?
- No!

38:47.489 --> 38:49.526
I want you to shut
that thing immediately.

38:49.558 --> 38:50.893
What?
This is fascinating.

38:50.926 --> 38:53.062
These are actual medieval
torture devices.

38:53.096 --> 38:56.933
Well, now I understand why you
and the Professor were friends.

38:56.966 --> 38:59.835
- What is that?!
- A tongue tearer.

38:59.868 --> 39:02.037
Okay, well, that seems
completely necessary. [Chuckles]

39:02.071 --> 39:04.440
[Grunts]

39:07.143 --> 39:10.913
- Medieval birth control.
- Just don't go out,

39:10.946 --> 39:13.882
and then you don't need birth control!

39:13.915 --> 39:16.394
Or you can call Martinez.

39:17.386 --> 39:18.888
No.

39:18.921 --> 39:20.522
[Clang]

39:20.556 --> 39:23.493
- You really think so?
- Definitely.

39:23.526 --> 39:28.864
Okay, I'll call Martinez
if you ask Kent out.

39:28.897 --> 39:32.669
- Wha... Kent?
- Yes, Kent!

39:32.701 --> 39:34.036
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

39:34.069 --> 39:37.406
It's so obvious there's totally
something going on.

39:37.439 --> 39:39.108
- Maura!
- That's ridiculous.

39:39.142 --> 39:40.710
- It is n...
- We work together.

39:40.743 --> 39:42.879
<i>Come on.
Bring the tongue tearer, though.</i>

39:42.911 --> 39:45.714

- Yeah, he does talk a lot.</i>

[Door opens]

Jane.
I saw the news.

40:20.549 --> 40:23.987
- I'm glad you're okay.
- Thank you.

40:24.020 --> 40:29.025
I have time, if you needed
the confessional.

40:29.058 --> 40:32.195
Actually, I don't.

40:32.227 --> 40:36.466
I mean, not...
not today, anyway. I just...

40:36.498 --> 40:39.502
I just came by to pay my respects.

40:39.535 --> 40:45.475
"But I say to you,
'Love your enemies

40:45.507 --> 40:49.178
and pray for those
that persecute you.'"

Matthew?
[Chuckles]

40:54.250 --> 40:57.752
I can't say it to that, but...

40:57.787 --> 41:01.557
I'm okay with the way it turned out.

41:03.259 --> 41:05.261
I hope He is, too.
