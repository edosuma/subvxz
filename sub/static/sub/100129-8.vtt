WEBVTT

00:15.319 --> 00:16.668
- My name's Jerry Cripe.

00:16.799 --> 00:19.497
I did Karate for 15 years.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.673
We do weapons training,

00:21.804 --> 00:23.240
and then I needed
my own weapons

00:23.371 --> 00:25.373
so I just started making them.

00:25.503 --> 00:28.071
My discipline in martial arts
will help me get through

00:28.202 --> 00:31.814
this competition by being calm,
breathing, getting centered,

00:31.944 --> 00:34.164
and I'm the type of guy
that's gonna finish,

00:34.295 --> 00:36.210
and I'm not gonna
give up, no matter what.

00:38.212 --> 00:39.778
- My name is Brent Smith,
and I'm from West Virginia.

00:39.909 --> 00:40.910
When I'm working in my shop,

00:41.041 --> 00:43.086
it's--a lot of it's music
oriented.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.828
When you're banging metal you
want something hard and fast.

00:45.958 --> 00:48.265
It's hard rock
and some good old '90s rap.

00:48.396 --> 00:49.658
I dance a lot in the shop.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.356
- My name is Thomas Hacker.

00:52.487 --> 00:53.792
I'm a seventh grade
science teacher

00:53.923 --> 00:56.230
and a part-time
bladesmith.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.841
I've always thought about
doing the competition

00:58.971 --> 01:01.235
but was always
too terrified to do it.

01:01.365 --> 01:04.542
But my students were bugging me
to death about it, so...

01:04.673 --> 01:06.414
I finally took the leap.

01:06.544 --> 01:09.765
I'm doing this competition
to inspire my students

01:09.895 --> 01:11.680
to go for things that
they're passionate about.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.248
- My name's Rick Hall.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.685
I ended up being a steer
wrestler for 15 years

01:16.815 --> 01:18.600
in the PRCA.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.994
Would jump off a horse
and land on a steer

01:22.125 --> 01:23.866
and throw him on the ground.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.696
- Bladesmiths.
Welcome to The Forge.

01:27.826 --> 01:30.090
We've got fun and games today,
gentlemen.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.874
You're here to engage
in three rounds

01:32.004 --> 01:34.485
of timed edged weapon making
competition, designed

01:34.616 --> 01:37.749
to test every aspect of your
bladesmithing capabilities

01:37.880 --> 01:40.926
in front of a panel of expert
judges and the world.

01:41.057 --> 01:43.103
The judges will tell us which
of you is our next

01:43.233 --> 01:44.452
"Forged in Fire" champion.

01:44.582 --> 01:46.018
So let's meet them now.

01:46.149 --> 01:49.587
Up first, two-time "Forged in
Fire" champion Ben Abbott.

01:49.718 --> 01:52.068
Next, historic weapons
re-creation specialist

01:52.199 --> 01:53.722
David Baker.

01:53.852 --> 01:57.291
And last, edged weapons
specialist Doug Marcaida.

01:57.421 --> 01:58.509
Gentlemen,
I know you're itching

01:58.640 --> 01:59.858
to get this party started.

01:59.989 --> 02:02.122
But you can't have a party
without music,

02:02.252 --> 02:04.602
and what does music have in
common with "Forged in Fire"?

02:04.733 --> 02:06.604
Check this out.

02:09.607 --> 02:11.261
"Forged in Fire!"

02:13.785 --> 02:15.787
I can't carry a tune in a
bucket with a lid on it,

02:15.918 --> 02:17.093
but I can tell you that

02:17.224 --> 02:18.790
here in this first round
of competition,

02:18.921 --> 02:23.534
you will use this set
of heavy metal band equipment

02:23.665 --> 02:26.363
and combine that
with another heavy metal.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.017
There's a cloth
on top of your anvils,

02:28.148 --> 02:29.105
go ahead
and lift that up.

02:32.413 --> 02:35.024
That is W1 round stock

02:35.155 --> 02:38.375
that you will have to combine
using a San Mai technique

02:38.506 --> 02:40.682
with the mild steel
from these instruments

02:40.812 --> 02:43.293
to forge a signature blade
in your signature style

02:43.424 --> 02:45.339
with a through-tang.

02:45.469 --> 02:48.559
- I see this drum set,
and there's miniscule amounts

02:48.690 --> 02:53.216
of mild steel to make a San Mai
with a ginormous chunk of W1.

02:53.347 --> 02:54.783
- If you make it
to the second round,

02:54.913 --> 02:56.480
you'll attach handles
to those blades

02:56.611 --> 02:59.396
so that we can test them
for strength and durability

02:59.527 --> 03:02.704
in an
electric guitar smash and bash.

03:02.834 --> 03:07.230
And for edge retention in an
electric guitar string slice.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.014
Failure to meet a single one
of our parameters

03:09.145 --> 03:10.973
is grounds for immediate
dismissal from The Forge

03:11.103 --> 03:12.453
with no deliberation.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.324
I remind you that at the end
of this round,

03:14.455 --> 03:16.239
after the judges
have critiqued your work,

03:16.370 --> 03:18.154
one of you will have
to surrender your blade

03:18.285 --> 03:19.677
and leave The Forge.

03:19.808 --> 03:20.983
Good luck, bladesmiths.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.985
Your time starts...

03:23.115 --> 03:23.942
three, two, one,

03:24.073 --> 03:24.987
now!

03:27.381 --> 03:28.947
Out here on the Forge Floor,

03:29.078 --> 03:31.036
these guys are raging
against the machines

03:31.167 --> 03:34.736
as they try to complete
San Mai billets,

03:34.866 --> 03:37.521
forged from W1 that
they found on their anvils

03:37.652 --> 03:41.003
and also from mild steel
in our drum kit, here.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.352
- But look right in the middle
of the drum set.

03:42.483 --> 03:43.919
See the two toms?

03:44.049 --> 03:46.661
I see two 3/4-inch pieces of
steel right there,

03:46.791 --> 03:48.010
they're upright.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.447
- Oh, the uprights
on the smaller drums, up top.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.580
- That's probably the two
largest pieces of steel

03:52.710 --> 03:54.408
on that drum set.

03:54.538 --> 03:57.019
- Thomas is going
for the pedal.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.760
- I'm thinking "okay,

03:58.890 --> 04:00.892
that looks like a really big
chunk of steel that I can use."

04:01.023 --> 04:05.114
And I flip it upside down,
and it's a piece of plastic.

04:05.245 --> 04:10.989
I see a seat that looks like
it has a mild steel tube.

04:11.120 --> 04:14.776
- Trying to cut open the hollow
tube steel would be a bad idea.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.125
We've seen again and again

04:16.256 --> 04:18.606
where smiths have used
very, very thin metal

04:18.736 --> 04:20.390
to try and do a San Mai,

04:20.521 --> 04:22.087
and they had that metal just
warp right away

04:22.218 --> 04:23.306
from whatever
second steel they got.

04:23.437 --> 04:24.525
- Yeah.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.266
-  Thomas can't
figure out

04:26.396 --> 04:28.398
how to get the
sparks to go the other way.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.012
- First thing I grabbed,
some cymbals.

04:34.143 --> 04:36.667
- Brass won't forge well
with hard metals.

04:36.798 --> 04:40.192
And it looks like Jerry's going
to use the brass cymbal.

04:40.323 --> 04:41.716
- No--oh, my God,
he's got the cymbals.

04:41.846 --> 04:42.804
- Yeah.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.066
That's a whole thing.

04:44.196 --> 04:45.372
Babe, "kttsschhh".

04:46.938 --> 04:48.940
- Wait a minute, why is
that cymbal throwing sparks?

04:49.071 --> 04:50.768
- He's cutting something off
the bottom of that.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.509
- No, no, he's cutting
through the cymbal.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.597
The cymbal's throwing
those sparks.

04:53.728 --> 04:54.903
- What?

04:55.033 --> 04:56.426
- Well, then that cymbal
isn't brass.

04:56.557 --> 04:58.776
- What is that cymbal made of,
then?

04:58.907 --> 05:01.039
- That's coated steel
or something.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.607
- I went with the cymbal
because it's flat,

05:03.738 --> 05:06.654
and I don't have to do
any force to it.

05:06.784 --> 05:09.700
It's a little thin,
but I think I can make it work.

05:12.007 --> 05:12.790
- Oh, what the?
- Do it.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.183
- Heavy metal!

05:19.057 --> 05:20.624
- Started making blades
with a friend of mine

05:20.755 --> 05:22.278
about 20 years ago.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.759
And he ended up dying.

05:24.889 --> 05:26.326
He had leukemia.

05:26.456 --> 05:29.285
And I've just been doing it
ever since.

05:29.416 --> 05:30.939
There's two different ways
to do San Mai.

05:31.069 --> 05:33.811
Either go
mild steel on the outside,

05:33.942 --> 05:35.857
and just don't bring it down
to the cutting edge,

05:35.987 --> 05:38.425
or you can go
mild steel in the middle,

05:38.555 --> 05:41.558
and keep it on the spine,
leaving your cutting edge W1.

05:41.689 --> 05:42.820
- Rick put the mild steel
in the middle,

05:42.951 --> 05:44.126
towards the back.

05:44.256 --> 05:45.475
- Oh, he did put the mild steel
in the middle.

05:45.606 --> 05:46.824
- Yeah, yeah.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.173
I don't think
we've ever seen anybody

05:48.304 --> 05:51.699
do a mild steel core San Mai
in this forge.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.309
- We haven't, we haven't.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.224
It's a very traditional way
to make a sword.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.008
That way,
you've got a soft core

05:57.139 --> 05:58.619
and a hard exterior.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.882
- I mean, it's great if the
mild steel's on the spine.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.928
But if it's on the blade edge--
- Not so good.

06:05.843 --> 06:08.150
- I'm thinking I need to
find the biggest, thickest

06:08.280 --> 06:09.586
piece of the steel
I can come up with.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.501
- But Brent,
over in his workstation,

06:11.632 --> 06:13.242
has the guitar stand,

06:13.373 --> 06:15.853
which is made out of
a lot of pieces of steel.

06:15.984 --> 06:18.943
- Wanna make all three pieces
match as close as I can,

06:19.074 --> 06:20.815
thickness wise,
so they heat evenly.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.252
I'm rotating my mild steel in
and out on the forge,

06:23.383 --> 06:25.167
and I'm heading to the press.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.387
And it's just playing this
game--leapfrog.

06:27.517 --> 06:29.301
The whole time, playing
leapfrog with my steel.

06:30.912 --> 06:33.088
- Thomas is being
really meticulous

06:33.218 --> 06:36.657
about cleaning up
those thin bits of mild steel.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.398
- I like to see clean steel,

06:38.528 --> 06:41.226
but I don't like to see people
waiting an hour to clean it.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.794
- I'm worried that if I don't
get my steel clean,

06:43.925 --> 06:47.276
I can get a bunch of big
delamination marks.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.626
At one point I realized, I
only need to clean up the side

06:49.757 --> 06:52.847
that's actually going to stick
to my high carbon steel,

06:52.977 --> 06:55.371
but it's just taking a lot
more time than I'd like.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.242
- Bladesmiths!

06:57.373 --> 07:00.028
One hour has elapsed.

07:00.158 --> 07:03.684
Thomas, it's time to make a
knife, brother.

07:03.814 --> 07:06.774
- He's in the zone, Wil.
He's in the zone.

07:06.904 --> 07:10.038
- I'm cleaning up my cymbals
so that the mild steel

07:10.168 --> 07:12.432
will stick to my W1.

07:12.562 --> 07:15.260
- Still haven't seen Jerry put
any mild steel to his blade.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.001
Concerned?

07:17.132 --> 07:18.699
- Yeah, especially because the
mild steel he's chosen is

07:18.829 --> 07:20.265
is so thin.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.354
- By the time he tries to put
those loads together

07:22.485 --> 07:26.054
those super thin layers are
just gonna warp away on him.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.841
- I'm not paying attention
to the clock.

07:30.972 --> 07:34.279
I'm just thinking
it's gonna be okay.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.368
I get that billet
in the forge,

07:36.499 --> 07:37.718
and then I bring it up to
temperature,

07:37.848 --> 07:42.287
and my thin lamination is
just wrinkling up.

07:42.418 --> 07:45.508
The mild steel's too thin so--
not a good weld.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.597
- Oh, there's three large
blisters

07:47.728 --> 07:50.687
where the steel in between
the welds just pulled away

07:50.818 --> 07:53.211
from the center steel.
That's a big problem

07:53.342 --> 07:55.344
- I start hammering
it really lightly,

07:55.475 --> 07:58.303
see if I can forge-weld
those thin pieces together.

07:58.434 --> 08:00.044
And it's starting to work,

08:00.175 --> 08:03.657
and I think,
"Well, I'll deal with it."

08:03.787 --> 08:06.311
- I put the mild steel
right in the middle of

08:06.442 --> 08:09.706
the two pieces of W1, towards
the top edge on the spine,

08:09.837 --> 08:11.491
so it doesn't affect
the cutting edge.

08:11.621 --> 08:13.405
To keep track of where the
mild steel is in the billet,

08:13.536 --> 08:16.670
I've got the handle welded
with point of the angle iron

08:16.800 --> 08:18.367
just like an arrow,

08:18.498 --> 08:21.239
and I put it so the arrow is
facing towards the mild steel.

08:21.370 --> 08:22.980
- I think Rick's nailing it.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.635
- The thing I hope doesn't go
wrong with Rick,

08:25.766 --> 08:28.464
is forgetting which side
he put that mild steel on.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.031
- Bladesmiths!

08:30.161 --> 08:33.251
You have just 90 minutes
remaining to finish your work.

08:34.644 --> 08:35.863
Look at that banana.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.865
Brent's got a hot banana!

08:37.995 --> 08:39.431
- As I'm setting my welds,

08:39.562 --> 08:42.347
I see my blade start to take
the infamous banana shape.

08:42.478 --> 08:44.959
- What he did was take a big,
flat piece of steel

08:45.089 --> 08:47.135
and put a little piece of mild
top and bottom.

08:47.265 --> 08:51.052
As you flatten that all out,
the extra steel stretches

08:51.182 --> 08:52.880
more than the other steel
so it starts to curve

08:53.010 --> 08:54.577
round and round and round.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.841
- So I'm constantly having
to take the banana out.

08:57.972 --> 08:59.843
I'm in that chasing my tail
game, right now.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.758
But I'm able
to keep up with it.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.847
It didn't get away from me.
I can manage it.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.591
- So Thomas, heading over
to the welding station

09:08.722 --> 09:09.853
finally.

09:09.984 --> 09:13.640
And he's trying to get
his weld set up.

09:13.770 --> 09:17.861
- I realize that the piece I
tack welded onto the steel,

09:17.992 --> 09:20.995
the side that I cleaned up,
is on the outside.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.954
And I think trying
to clean it up

09:24.085 --> 09:25.695
is just going to take way
too much time.

09:25.826 --> 09:28.132
So I decide
to just run with it

09:28.263 --> 09:29.873
and hope for the best
at this point.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.573
- Ooh, that didn't look good.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.618
Thomas' blade,
when he was just hammering it,

09:35.749 --> 09:38.447
it looked like a
whole section just blistered.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.057
That wouldn't surprise me
at all

09:40.188 --> 09:42.146
if that dented her.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.061
- All you can do when something
blisters like that is--

09:44.192 --> 09:46.281
You have to cut it a groove or
drill a hole or something

09:46.411 --> 09:48.544
to allow that gas to escape.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.372
And then weld it back again.

09:50.502 --> 09:55.377
- I just put a slit in it
so we'll see if it takes.

09:56.857 --> 09:59.250
- I got this thing
forge-welded together

09:59.381 --> 10:02.558
So I go and start
getting a knife shape.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.430
- So with heavy metal music,
is there a slow version?

10:05.561 --> 10:08.433
Because Jerry's moving
at a slow tempo.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.522
That heat must have
fatigued him a lot.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.568
- Jerry's more of a Pink Floyd,
I think.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.396
He didn't quite hit
the heavy metal.

10:24.493 --> 10:27.235
- Rick is the only one of our
smiths that cut a channel

10:27.365 --> 10:30.455
into the high carbon
and laid the mild into there.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.240
So we've got
two different techniques

10:32.370 --> 10:33.763
for creating San Mai.

10:33.894 --> 10:37.332
It'll be interesting
to see what works the best.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.726
- Now I'm ready to start
forging in the tang,

10:39.856 --> 10:42.293
and to forge a tang
I need to use tongs.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.818
So the angle iron panel
that I keep track

10:44.948 --> 10:47.429
of the mild steel with--
gotta go bye-bye.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.304
My billet rolls off the saw

10:53.435 --> 10:55.219
and I was like .

10:55.350 --> 10:57.526
I have no idea
where my mild steel is.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.355
And it's critical that I don't
lose track of the mild steel

11:00.485 --> 11:02.183
because I could end up having
it on the cutting edge,

11:02.313 --> 11:03.619
which would be devastating.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.364
So I'm gonna take my billet
and grind off both sides

11:09.494 --> 11:13.281
and then acid etch it to see
if I can see any contrast

11:13.411 --> 11:17.328
to tell me
where my mild steel is.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.722
- Lots of things can go wrong
in the quench.

11:19.853 --> 11:22.594
So I won't have enough time
left to correct any errors

11:22.725 --> 11:25.423
or anything that might pop up
or off in the quench.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.733
- Brent just went for a quench

11:30.864 --> 11:32.648
with an hour to go.
Good for him.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.521
- Sounds like a
pretty good file test to me.

11:36.652 --> 11:39.568
- Aw, I think Brent might have
the warps.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.874
- I'm thinking, "Oh, crap."

11:41.004 --> 11:42.179
I have to do that one again.

11:42.310 --> 11:43.964
It's beyond the point
of grinding.

11:44.094 --> 11:46.575
I have to go back
in the quench.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.924
Not real thrilled about that,

11:48.055 --> 11:49.665
bit too much stress
on my high carbon steel,

11:49.796 --> 11:50.971
but I'd rather turn in
a straight blade

11:51.101 --> 11:52.233
than a curved
blade any day.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.324
- Another quench.

11:56.454 --> 11:58.674
- Pull it out, there's still
a minor little warp in it,

11:58.805 --> 12:00.371
but I know now
that it's grindable.

12:00.502 --> 12:02.460
I can hide this.
I can make it go away.

12:03.592 --> 12:05.072
- I don't think Jerry's
doing too well.

12:05.202 --> 12:06.508
I'll tell you the truth.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.336
What's going on, Jerry?
How you feeling, man?

12:08.466 --> 12:09.729
- All right.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.078
- Are you drinking water
out there?

12:11.208 --> 12:12.819
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.777
- Yeah.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.213
- I think the heat's getting
to him.

12:16.344 --> 12:17.519
Let's keep an eye on Jerry.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.132
- I forge-welded the bubble,

12:22.263 --> 12:24.961
and everything
is looking good.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.877
I heat it just to that right,
perfect temperature

12:28.008 --> 12:29.749
and go in for the quench.

12:29.879 --> 12:33.187
I'm just trying to keep
a death grip on that knife

12:33.317 --> 12:35.537
so I don't drop it in there.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.104
That's the one thing
my wife said

12:37.234 --> 12:40.150
is, "Don't drop the knife
in the quench tank."

12:42.631 --> 12:44.198
All right.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.243
I didn't drop it.

12:46.374 --> 12:47.767
- Bladesmiths!

12:47.897 --> 12:48.985
30 minutes.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.861
Jerry just quenched.

12:54.991 --> 12:58.647
I mean, he had all of those
really thin sections of cymbal,

12:58.778 --> 13:00.823
and we didn't think that was
gonna forge-weld up,

13:00.954 --> 13:02.390
and look at him go.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.522
- Jerry upped the tempo.
Look at those sparks.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.394
Man, he's really going at it.

13:06.524 --> 13:10.311
Throwing a rock and roll
concert shower of sparks

13:10.441 --> 13:11.791
down at his feet.

13:11.921 --> 13:14.358
- I need to get this at least
shaved and ground

13:14.489 --> 13:18.841
so I can get it in the etch,
'cause I don't wanna go down

13:18.972 --> 13:22.714
in this round without having
a finished San Mai blade.

13:24.368 --> 13:25.674
- After I etched,
what I'm looking for

13:25.805 --> 13:28.851
is a really thin piece
of mild steel sandwiched

13:28.982 --> 13:30.810
in between these two big
pieces of carbon steel.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.594
There it is.

13:32.724 --> 13:36.076
I think I see my mild steel,
and I put a mark on it,

13:36.206 --> 13:38.078
and then I start profiling it.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.254
- I like how Rick is
stepping it up over here.

13:40.384 --> 13:43.170
I like the rough forging
at the tf his blade,

13:43.300 --> 13:45.476
all of his grinds are coming up
to meet that.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.435
No chatter marks
or anything like that.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.002
It's really nice.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.438
Bladesmiths!

13:50.568 --> 13:52.440
15 minutes.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.746
You have only 15 minutes
remaining in the round.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.228
- I get my blade out of the
quench for the second time,

13:58.359 --> 13:59.490
it's straight;
I'm happy with it.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.710
Start grinding,
it's too hot to handle,

14:01.841 --> 14:04.582
stick it in the water.

14:04.713 --> 14:05.888
Bad decision.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.716
- Uh-oh,
Brent just saw something

14:07.847 --> 14:08.891
and then looked
at the clock.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.112
- Crap.

14:12.242 --> 14:14.984
- He's got a crack all the way
down the spine of his blade.

14:15.115 --> 14:16.464
- Oh, wow.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.118
- She just opened up
like a grand canyon.

14:18.248 --> 14:20.468
I stuck it in the water
a little too soon.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.296
- But now that
he's identified that,

14:22.426 --> 14:23.384
MIG weld the hell out of it.

14:23.514 --> 14:24.341
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

14:24.472 --> 14:25.734
- And then go back.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.257
- This is the part that's hard,
that matters.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.129
I have no pull apart
right here.

14:29.259 --> 14:32.088
This is the spine.
I can weld that, seal it up.

14:32.219 --> 14:33.829
Just pray it's not
too deep.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.266
'Cause this could cause a
catastrophic failure.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.747
- Brent, it looks like he's
just rounding everything out

14:38.878 --> 14:40.314
where that weld was.

14:40.444 --> 14:41.489
- If I don't get this
corrected now,

14:41.619 --> 14:42.403
this could be
the end of it.

14:44.361 --> 14:46.059
- Five, four,

14:46.189 --> 14:48.017
three, two,

14:48.148 --> 14:49.714
one.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.891
Bladesmiths, shut down your
machines, drop your tools.

14:52.021 --> 14:54.676
This first round of competition
is over.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.374
- I've hidden it,

14:57.505 --> 14:59.594
but there's still a crack
under there somewhere.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.552
I'm fearful that my chances

15:01.683 --> 15:03.032
are pretty high
of going home.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.078
Nobody wants to turn in
a cracked blade,

15:05.208 --> 15:07.036
and everybody saw
the Grand Canyon.

15:08.385 --> 15:09.560
- All right, bladesmiths.

15:09.691 --> 15:11.258
Now it's time for the judges
to take a closer look

15:11.388 --> 15:12.563
at your work.

15:12.694 --> 15:13.738
Jerry, you're up first.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.653
Please present your blade
to the judges.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.006
- Well, Jerry, your blade has
got a handsome shape to it.

15:20.136 --> 15:21.746
I like it.

15:21.877 --> 15:24.140
The one big thing--this is a
lot of tang

15:24.271 --> 15:26.229
for a through-tang blade.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.318
I mean, this needs to come down
by quite a bit.

15:28.449 --> 15:31.017
But it's one big, heavy,
solid knife.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.368
- All right, Brent,
you're up next.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.370
Please present your blade
to the judges.

15:38.502 --> 15:41.201
- All right, Brent,
that's a beautiful blade.

15:41.331 --> 15:44.030
And I know what went into it
to fix it.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.423
There was a crack
all the way down there,

15:46.554 --> 15:48.730
and we've seen a lot of people
fill it with MIG weld,

15:48.860 --> 15:50.993
but rounding that off
and fixing it?

15:51.124 --> 15:52.603
That's a great job,
right there.

15:52.734 --> 15:55.606
The only pause over here is
you have a very big tang.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.304
So later on, we don't want a
lot of movement in there.

15:57.434 --> 15:58.392
We want to marry it to the
handle

15:58.522 --> 15:59.654
when you're cutting
through that.

15:59.784 --> 16:01.961
But overall,
great save.

16:02.091 --> 16:03.310
- Thank you.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.441
- Thomas, you're up.

16:04.572 --> 16:05.573
Please present your blade

16:05.703 --> 16:06.661
to the judges.

16:08.663 --> 16:09.838
- Well, Thomas, I really like

16:09.969 --> 16:11.361
this shape of blade,
you have here.

16:11.492 --> 16:14.712
It's a very effective chopper,
but a lot of mass here,

16:14.843 --> 16:16.366
and it looks like
you're well set up

16:16.497 --> 16:19.282
for a two-handed chopper.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.502
I'm sure you can figure out
a way around that,

16:21.632 --> 16:24.244
but well done.
- Thank you.

16:24.374 --> 16:25.288
- All right, Rick,
you're up.

16:25.419 --> 16:26.333
Please present your blade

16:26.463 --> 16:27.247
to the judges.

16:28.770 --> 16:31.294
- I really like the idea
you had

16:31.425 --> 16:32.992
of putting the mild
in the core.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.298
Unfortunately, we can see it

16:35.429 --> 16:38.562
running right through the
center where your edge is.

16:38.693 --> 16:40.042
Somewhere along the line,

16:40.173 --> 16:41.739
and maybe it was because
you put that notch there,

16:41.870 --> 16:43.524
I think this
got flipped on you.

16:43.654 --> 16:47.832
It's very apparent that
that mild steel is running

16:47.963 --> 16:50.096
right down the center
of that blade, on the edge.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.450
- All right, bladesmiths.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.017
The judges deliberation
is complete.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.540
They've made their
final decision.

16:59.670 --> 17:02.238
Only three of you can move
forward in this competition.

17:02.369 --> 17:03.587
One of you has to leave
The Forge.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.200
Rick,

17:07.330 --> 17:10.246
unfortunately that mild steel
in the core of your blade,

17:10.377 --> 17:12.901
all the way down to the edge,
has corrupted

17:13.032 --> 17:14.555
the integrity
of your blade.

17:14.685 --> 17:15.860
And for that reason,

17:15.991 --> 17:17.079
I have to ask you
please leave The Forge.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.341
Come on forward, my friend.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.736
- I am disappointed,

17:21.866 --> 17:24.347
but I did the best I could.

17:24.478 --> 17:25.870
Thank you. I really enjoyed
the experience.

17:26.001 --> 17:28.308
It was fun to meet
the other bladesmiths.

17:29.700 --> 17:32.094
What's next for me is go
home, kiss my wife,

17:32.225 --> 17:33.922
and make more blades.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.059
- Bladesmiths, congratulations.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.322
You've made it to the second
round of this competition.

17:42.452 --> 17:44.585
In this round you'll have an
opportunity to attach handles

17:44.715 --> 17:47.240
to those blades, turning them
into fully functional weapons.

17:47.370 --> 17:50.069
In addition to the handles,
you must also have

17:50.199 --> 17:52.114
steel guards and pommels
on your blades

17:52.245 --> 17:53.594
by the end of
this round.

17:53.724 --> 17:55.422
You'll have just two hours in
which to complete

17:55.552 --> 17:56.684
all this work.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.077
At the end of that time
we'll be testing

17:58.207 --> 18:00.079
your blades for
strength and durability,

18:00.209 --> 18:03.212
in an electric guitar
smash and bash,

18:03.343 --> 18:05.432
and for edge retention
in a guitar string slice.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.478
Gentlemen, I remind you that

18:08.609 --> 18:10.089
after your weapons
have been tested,

18:10.219 --> 18:12.613
one of you will be selected
to surrender your blade

18:12.743 --> 18:13.918
and leave The Forge.

18:14.049 --> 18:16.356
Your two hours starts now.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.751
Speaking of heavy metal,

18:20.882 --> 18:24.059
we had some heavy steel blades
come in after that first round.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.322
Each of these guys has
a lot of grinding to do.

18:26.453 --> 18:27.976
Who's got the most work to do?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.500
- Jerry's got
a very broad handle

18:30.631 --> 18:31.893
that needs to be
tapered down

18:32.023 --> 18:34.591
to make it easily usable
as a through-tang.

18:34.722 --> 18:37.116
- I start by marking my blade
to see what side

18:37.246 --> 18:40.249
I need to take
material off

18:40.380 --> 18:41.468
to get my tang narrowed up
and, you know,

18:41.598 --> 18:44.035
ready for handle material.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.646
Oh, I've got to think it out
methodically

18:45.776 --> 18:48.649
and do a step
at a time.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.132
- I'm thinking I can drill
some holes in my guard

18:53.262 --> 18:55.395
and file it through to fit
my tang in there,

18:55.525 --> 18:57.440
or I can make it easy
on myself

18:57.571 --> 18:59.442
and just cut a slot
to fit my guard

18:59.573 --> 19:00.835
right onto the ricasso
of my knife

19:00.965 --> 19:02.445
and just to weld it on.

19:02.576 --> 19:05.883
- I'm guessing that Thomas
always works alone,

19:06.014 --> 19:07.276
because he always finds a way

19:07.407 --> 19:09.191
to throw sparks right
at somebody else.

19:10.975 --> 19:13.717
- I'm trying to test up my
guard and next thing I know,

19:13.848 --> 19:15.197
I'm taking a spark bath.

19:15.328 --> 19:16.633
- I'm really in my zone here,

19:16.764 --> 19:19.245
and I really just apologize
to Brent

19:19.375 --> 19:21.116
because I know he doesn't have
any hair on his head,

19:21.247 --> 19:24.728
but at least he's got that hat
to cover him up.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.732
- I need to make the best use
of every minute that I have,

19:28.863 --> 19:30.343
so I have to ignore
those sparks

19:30.473 --> 19:32.345
- You know what,
that's what rock stars do, man.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.129
They just roll with it.

19:34.260 --> 19:38.394
Your hair catches on fire, you
just keep playing the gig, man.

19:38.525 --> 19:39.917
- Picked out
the handle material,

19:40.048 --> 19:41.745
picked out my pommel
and my guard,

19:41.876 --> 19:43.660
and now it's time
to get everything fine-tuned

19:43.791 --> 19:46.359
to where it fits
the judges' hands nicely.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.752
I have to address this tang
issue the judges pointed out.

19:48.883 --> 19:51.102
Quickest way to do that is
chop it off with a saw

19:51.233 --> 19:52.930
and weld a piece of mild steel
rod on the end of it.

19:53.061 --> 19:58.153
I know mild steel is much
easier to peen than the W1 is.

19:58.284 --> 20:01.156
- Well, look at how that tang
has changed shape

20:01.287 --> 20:02.766
for Jerry, man.

20:02.897 --> 20:06.770
He put that blade on a weight
loss plan like no other.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.381
Done a great job.

20:08.511 --> 20:10.121
- I think Jerry's doing great
things for his blade,

20:10.252 --> 20:11.775
but I think Jerry's taking a
whole lot of time

20:11.906 --> 20:12.863
to do those things.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.517
I mean, it's almost an hour,

20:14.648 --> 20:17.259
and he hasn't even started
touching his handle yet.

20:17.390 --> 20:18.739
- This is a
physical competition.

20:18.869 --> 20:21.089
It's a mental competition.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.830
You have to have skill,

20:22.960 --> 20:26.050
and you have to have
a little bit of stamina.

20:26.181 --> 20:27.356
- Stamina, there you go.

20:27.487 --> 20:31.447
- I think Jerry's
losing stamina right now.

20:31.578 --> 20:34.189
Thomas, over here, he looks
like he's got his guard set up,

20:34.320 --> 20:35.843
everything's in place,
what do you think?

20:35.973 --> 20:37.714
- So the way that
Thomas did his guard

20:37.845 --> 20:40.369
was to do a slotted guard
and then come back

20:40.500 --> 20:41.805
with a MIG welder
and weld it in place.

20:41.936 --> 20:44.199
- Oh, man.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.070
- It's something I've never
seen until I've been here.

20:46.201 --> 20:47.811
And I've never seen
someone do that

20:47.942 --> 20:48.899
at their home shop ever.

20:50.727 --> 20:52.207
- For the pommel,
I know I need a thicker piece.

20:52.338 --> 20:53.687
It's gotta have
some weight to it.

20:53.817 --> 20:56.037
I wanna try to find the
right balance for this blade.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.082
So I went with a thicker chunk
of steel.

20:58.213 --> 21:00.346
- A pommel--it's gotta have
a function.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.783
Could serve as a flair
for retention.

21:02.913 --> 21:05.220
Could be used as a skull
crusher to pummel somebody

21:05.351 --> 21:06.700
or a counterbalance.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.702
But there's always
a function to that.

21:08.832 --> 21:11.357
Other than just like a butt cap
where he just caps it off.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.926
- 20 minutes, bladesmiths.

21:16.057 --> 21:17.667
- Jerry is taking the slowest
method possible

21:17.798 --> 21:19.365
to do this guard.

21:19.495 --> 21:21.889
I mean, we have Dremel bits
over there that are very fast,

21:22.019 --> 21:23.499
and Jerry's got a chainsaw file

21:23.630 --> 21:25.240
and is slowly
connecting the holes.

21:25.371 --> 21:28.112
- Honestly, if I was right
where he was,

21:28.243 --> 21:29.592
I'd be sweating.

21:29.723 --> 21:32.987
- I'm just getting this guard
filed out,

21:33.117 --> 21:37.296
and things started going
wrong.

21:37.426 --> 21:41.038
I'm lightheaded.
They're asking if I'm okay.

21:41.169 --> 21:42.823
I'm not.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.914
- Something wrong going on
with Jerry rig

21:47.044 --> 21:48.524
- Something wrong going on
with Jerry right now.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.352
- Knowing that,
you know what's going on?

21:50.483 --> 21:52.441
- Jerry is--he's not
looking good.

21:56.271 --> 21:58.882
- I'm lightheaded.

21:59.013 --> 22:00.623
- You good?
- I don't know.

22:00.754 --> 22:02.233
- Yeah, look at me.
Keep talking to me, all right?

22:02.364 --> 22:03.539
- Yeah, okay.
Yeah, yeah.

22:03.670 --> 22:04.714
- Let me get some orange juice,
please?

22:04.845 --> 22:06.586
- I'm disoriented.

22:06.716 --> 22:08.152
- Who's our president, huh?

22:08.283 --> 22:09.415
- Ugh.
- Come on, look at me.

22:09.545 --> 22:10.720
- Trump.

22:10.851 --> 22:12.418
- I tried to stand up.
I can't stand up.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.637
'Cause I wanna get back in it.

22:14.768 --> 22:15.899
It's, like--
I still have time left.

22:16.030 --> 22:17.379
- Ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.121
- Put this over my head.
- All right.

22:20.251 --> 22:21.296
And you're
a little tall there, buddy.

22:21.427 --> 22:22.863
- There we go.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.560
- I don't think Jerry's out
here quitting on himself.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.127
I think he's pushed himself

22:26.257 --> 22:29.173
to the point of physical
and mental exhaustion,

22:29.304 --> 22:31.698
and it's just taking
its toll right now.

22:31.828 --> 22:34.135
On any other day,
he might be fine.

22:34.265 --> 22:35.179
This one bit him.

22:35.310 --> 22:38.095
- Okay, you good?
- Yeah.

22:38.226 --> 22:39.532
- So the medic's doing
a really good job

22:39.662 --> 22:41.142
of taking care of Jerry.

22:41.272 --> 22:43.100
Meanwhile, our smiths out here
on The Forge,

22:43.231 --> 22:44.972
they're still
taking care of business.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.800
These guys are still competing,

22:46.930 --> 22:47.975
and I have respect for that
as well.

22:48.105 --> 22:49.803
- Absolutely.

22:49.933 --> 22:51.805
I mean, where they're standing
they could look over and think,

22:51.935 --> 22:55.025
"Oh, Jerry's done,
I better step it up."

22:55.156 --> 22:57.288
- It is very nerve-racking
to peen a pommel like this

22:57.419 --> 22:58.855
because you have to be patient
with it.

22:58.986 --> 23:00.814
And having patience
and being in a rush

23:00.944 --> 23:02.206
don't go very well together.

23:02.337 --> 23:03.991
- You have Thomas doing
the same thing

23:04.121 --> 23:05.819
peening his pommel,
right there, with heat.

23:07.168 --> 23:08.865
- I was trying to
peen that over,

23:08.996 --> 23:11.651
but the propane torch wasn't
getting hot fast enough,

23:11.781 --> 23:13.740
and it caused
the heat to travel

23:13.870 --> 23:17.526
and burn all the glue away,
and it just came apart.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.702
- It looks like Thomas
started to peen it.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.008
It didn't work.

23:21.138 --> 23:24.054
- It burnt out the glue.
Now he's regluing.

23:24.185 --> 23:25.578
- My plan is
to just try to weld

23:25.708 --> 23:27.318
as much as I can
on the end

23:27.449 --> 23:28.798
without heating
it up too much.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.234
I'm just gonna try my best

23:30.365 --> 23:32.411
'cause I don't have
a lot of time left,

23:32.541 --> 23:34.978
and I still have to try
to shape my handle

23:35.109 --> 23:36.327
as fast as I can,

23:36.458 --> 23:39.200
and then get to grinding
on my blade.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.288
- Jerry's hurting bad.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.550
Jerry's not gonna make
a comeback.

23:41.681 --> 23:42.943
- No.
- Ugh.

23:43.073 --> 23:44.814
- Ten minutes, bladesmiths!

23:44.945 --> 23:46.990
- I finished peening
the pommel on.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.123
I have left--to finish
shaping the handle and sharpen,

23:49.253 --> 23:51.908
and I plan on using every last
second of this.

23:52.039 --> 23:53.388
I'm feeling the pressure
of the clock now,

23:53.519 --> 23:54.650
and I'm starting to rush
a little bit,

23:54.781 --> 23:57.610
and I don't like to rush.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.046
- Feels better now?
- Yeah.

23:59.176 --> 24:00.656
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:00.787 --> 24:03.616
Round one kicked my butt.
It was exhausting.

24:03.746 --> 24:05.705
And I just didn't have anything
left for round two,

24:05.835 --> 24:08.490
and I just realized that the
smartest thing for me to do

24:08.621 --> 24:10.753
was go over and sit on the
couch and get oxygen

24:10.884 --> 24:12.407
and take care of myself.

24:14.322 --> 24:16.367
- Five, four,

24:16.498 --> 24:18.195
three, two,

24:18.326 --> 24:19.849
one.

24:19.980 --> 24:22.069
Bladesmiths, shut down your
machines, drop your tools.

24:22.199 --> 24:25.202
This second round of
competition is over.

24:26.421 --> 24:27.988
- Great job.
- Thank God, man.

24:28.118 --> 24:29.293
Where's Jerry at?
- Where he at?

24:29.424 --> 24:30.947
- I look around to see Jerry--

24:31.078 --> 24:33.036
- We didn't know
if he'd finished early.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.734
We didn't have any idea

24:34.864 --> 24:36.431
that he had to be taken off
the floor like that.

24:37.911 --> 24:40.522
- Bladesmiths,
in this second round

24:40.653 --> 24:42.045
of heavy metal themed
competition,

24:42.176 --> 24:44.047
each of you was
to have finished

24:44.178 --> 24:46.267
a 12-to-14 inch
signature blade

24:46.397 --> 24:48.443
with a steel guard and pommel.

24:48.574 --> 24:51.272
Brent, looks like you've got
a solid blade there

24:51.402 --> 24:54.449
with a nicely finished
walnut handle.

24:54.580 --> 24:57.452
Thomas, you've also got a
complete knife

24:57.583 --> 25:00.716
with a Micarta and steel setup
on the handle.

25:00.847 --> 25:04.328
Jerry, unfortunately since
you didn't finish your blade,

25:04.459 --> 25:06.287
there will be no testing round
today.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.289
What happened out there?

25:08.419 --> 25:10.639
- Well, I was exhausted from
the first round.

25:10.770 --> 25:14.643
Just totally dehydrated
and thought,

25:14.774 --> 25:16.558
"Man, I'm sweating,
and I need to go over

25:16.689 --> 25:17.733
and get a drink
of water."

25:17.864 --> 25:20.475
Next thing you know,
I'm going out.

25:20.606 --> 25:23.173
You know, I'm not a young guy,
so--

25:23.304 --> 25:25.436
I thought I was up
for the challenge and--

25:25.567 --> 25:27.047
I was close.

25:27.177 --> 25:29.528
- Well, Jerry, you fought hard
through that first round.

25:29.658 --> 25:32.574
But, unfortunately, you just
didn't finish your work.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.010
And for that reason,

25:34.141 --> 25:35.621
I have to ask you to please
shake our hands

25:35.751 --> 25:37.100
and then please leave
The Forge.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.624
Come on forward, my friend.

25:40.321 --> 25:41.801
- This is not easy, man.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.367
You know,
I thought I was in shape.

25:43.498 --> 25:47.067
You know, I'm working out,
getting ready for this thing.

25:47.197 --> 25:51.114
I mean it's--it takes a lot
of physical, mental ability

25:51.245 --> 25:53.377
to do something like this.

25:53.508 --> 25:55.945
So I may not be the "Forged
in Fire" champion,

25:56.076 --> 25:57.817
but it was a great experience.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.126
- Brent, Thomas,
congratulations,

26:03.257 --> 26:04.388
you've made it into the third

26:04.519 --> 26:06.913
and final round
of this competition.

26:07.043 --> 26:09.742
Now we're sending you back
to your home forges

26:09.872 --> 26:12.701
to recreate this iconic weapon
from history.

26:19.447 --> 26:21.536
The Tizona Del Cid

26:21.667 --> 26:22.798
- Oh, my.

26:22.929 --> 26:24.408
- What is that?

26:24.539 --> 26:26.149
- One of Spain's most
celebrated war heroes,

26:26.280 --> 26:28.238
El Cid, or El Campeador,

26:28.369 --> 26:31.024
was a Castilian knight
from the 11th century,

26:31.154 --> 26:33.853
rumored to have never lost a
single sword battle.

26:33.983 --> 26:35.768
After conquering
the Moor-occupied city

26:35.898 --> 26:37.465
of Valencia in 1094,

26:37.596 --> 26:41.034
El Cid won the Tizona
from the king he usurped.

26:41.164 --> 26:43.602
The ornately crafted exotic
blade became

26:43.732 --> 26:46.648
a prized possession of the
Castilian royal family.

26:46.779 --> 26:49.433
Featuring a double edge with
an elaborate hilt and guard,

26:49.564 --> 26:51.435
the Tizona was a fast,
lethal weapon,

26:51.566 --> 26:53.524
while its deep fuller
kept the sword

26:53.655 --> 26:55.918
perfectly balanced
and lightweight.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.790
One of the greatest
Spanish swordsmen,

26:57.920 --> 26:59.661
El Cid's legacy is
immortalized

26:59.792 --> 27:02.272
in the Hollywood film
"El Cid."

27:02.403 --> 27:03.883
- Looking at the blade,

27:04.013 --> 27:07.669
I see this super ornate guard
and pommel,

27:07.800 --> 27:11.891
and I'm thinking, "How can I
get all this detail into it

27:12.021 --> 27:15.634
and make it strong
and functional?"

27:15.764 --> 27:18.201
- The length of the blade must
be between 30 and 32 inches,

27:18.332 --> 27:19.550
and have a fuller on each side.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.727
You must have a squid pommel,
a guard,

27:21.857 --> 27:24.686
upswept pierced quillions,
arms,

27:24.817 --> 27:26.906
and a bar guard connected
to the arms.

27:27.036 --> 27:28.690
You'll have just four days
at your home forges

27:28.821 --> 27:30.257
in which to
complete this challenge.

27:30.387 --> 27:32.433
At the end of those four days,
you will return

27:32.563 --> 27:35.175
and present your Tizonas
to our panel of expert judges,

27:35.305 --> 27:38.657
and after they've heavy metal
tested the hell out of 'em,

27:38.787 --> 27:41.485
they'll declare one of you
the "Forged in Fire" champion

27:41.616 --> 27:44.184
who walks out of here with a
check for ten grand.

27:44.314 --> 27:45.446
Good luck, bladesmiths.

27:45.576 --> 27:47.013
We'll see you in four days.

27:47.143 --> 27:48.405
- Good luck, brother.
- Good luck.

27:52.540 --> 27:55.717
- Today I have to make
El Cid's Tizona.

27:55.848 --> 27:57.632
I'm super nervous
about this build.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.416
I've never made a sword
like this.

27:59.547 --> 28:01.941
So today I'm starting with a
piece of 5160.

28:02.071 --> 28:04.900
It's pretty wide but,
just got my press running,

28:05.031 --> 28:07.033
and it's gonna save me
tons of time.

28:07.163 --> 28:09.644
Four inches to go.
Almost there.

28:11.298 --> 28:14.127
My problem is I don't have
enough steel on my tang

28:14.257 --> 28:16.346
to get it to
the length that I need

28:16.477 --> 28:19.567
so I'm gonna have to forge-weld
some mild steel onto it.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.662
I'm getting the tang drawn out
but I noticed the tang

28:27.793 --> 28:31.318
is getting twisted and I'm
really worried at this point

28:31.448 --> 28:33.581
because this could cause a
lot of stress.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.974
I will definitely have

28:35.104 --> 28:36.497
a little catching up
to do tomorrow.

28:38.673 --> 28:39.848
- We're here in West Virginia.

28:39.979 --> 28:41.937
So let's get these
burners a-burning.

28:42.068 --> 28:44.374
El Cid's blade is
a very light blade.

28:44.505 --> 28:45.854
I'm really concerned about how
I'm gonna keep it

28:45.985 --> 28:46.855
at that weight.

28:48.596 --> 28:50.032
After a few hours of forging,

28:50.163 --> 28:52.339
I finally had my piece
at the length.

28:52.469 --> 28:54.123
Climb up on my
little steppy stool

28:54.254 --> 28:58.388
and I can barely get the tip
of this blade into the quench.

28:58.519 --> 28:59.694
Quench went all right.

28:59.825 --> 29:01.304
Tomorrow I move
onto the pretty stuff.

29:03.132 --> 29:04.438
- It's day two.

29:04.568 --> 29:06.570
And I am gonna start over.

29:06.701 --> 29:08.921
Yesterday I had some problems
with the tang.

29:09.051 --> 29:10.792
It ended up twisting.

29:10.923 --> 29:13.229
For ten grand, I'm just not
gonna take that chance.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.623
So, today, I'm gonna
completely start from scratch

29:15.754 --> 29:17.712
and reforge my blade.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.456
It's pedal to the metal.
I've gotta hurry.

29:22.586 --> 29:24.980
I absolutely need to quench
this blade tonight,

29:25.111 --> 29:28.114
or I am gonna be
drastically behind.

29:28.244 --> 29:31.944
So I've got my blade forged out
to the shape I want.

29:32.074 --> 29:34.207
I'm leaving my tang
thicker than I need,

29:34.337 --> 29:37.471
so that, as I'm holding this
gigantic, long piece,

29:37.601 --> 29:39.212
it doesn't bend at the tang.

29:43.607 --> 29:46.872
Today I got my blade forged
and quenched.

29:47.002 --> 29:47.873
So happy.

29:51.354 --> 29:53.226
- Today's main goal is to get
the guard assembly.

29:53.356 --> 29:54.923
A lot of artistic work involved
with this piece.

29:55.054 --> 29:57.230
This is the kind of work I'm
really used to.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.971
These little small twists
and bends.

29:59.101 --> 30:01.538
Basic blacksmithing.

30:01.669 --> 30:03.236
So I've got
all my welding done now.

30:03.366 --> 30:05.891
It's time to clean this thing
up on the grinder.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.109
That is beautiful.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.589
I love that.

30:08.719 --> 30:11.026
I turn my attention
to the pommel.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.941
So I welded on the all thread
and it's a little thicker

30:13.072 --> 30:14.551
than the tang and I can't get
my guard off now.

30:14.682 --> 30:16.510
Aw, crap.

30:16.640 --> 30:17.467
I wanted to blew my guard.

30:17.598 --> 30:19.382
Too late to take it off.

30:19.513 --> 30:21.210
I want a nice,
even blew collar

30:21.341 --> 30:23.734
so I'm gonna have to blew it
when it's still on the blade.

30:26.607 --> 30:27.869
I grab a wet washcloth;
I wrap it around the sword;I'm gonna use a torch on an
already hardened blade.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.916
and I just hope I don't
screw this thing up.

30:31.046 --> 30:32.526
May not be bad.

30:32.656 --> 30:35.224
So now I turn my attention
back to the pommel.

30:35.355 --> 30:37.574
The key element is making it
look like a squid head.

30:37.705 --> 30:39.272
I've never seen a squid
in real life,

30:39.402 --> 30:41.361
but my son,
he loves calamari.

30:41.491 --> 30:42.666
- Right now I've got

30:42.797 --> 30:45.060
the majority of my guard
constructed.

30:45.191 --> 30:47.280
I have to add a little
crossbar

30:47.410 --> 30:49.499
to weld on as a cross guard.

30:49.630 --> 30:52.502
For the pommel, I plan on just
cutting a little cone out.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.374
I got it nice and sharp.

30:54.504 --> 30:55.810
My thin finish isn't perfect,

30:55.941 --> 30:58.334
but I made this sword
in three days

30:58.465 --> 31:00.554
so even if you feel like
you can't do it you

31:00.684 --> 31:03.296
just give it a shot, you really
never know what's gonna happen.

31:05.167 --> 31:07.430
- Here we are,
the last day of this build.

31:07.561 --> 31:09.215
Everything's progressed nicely
so far.

31:09.345 --> 31:12.305
Now I'm going to start the
mustard patina process.

31:12.435 --> 31:13.915
Basically, the vinegar
in the mustard reacts

31:14.046 --> 31:15.177
to high carbon steel.

31:15.308 --> 31:16.744
The blade begins
to slightly rust,

31:16.875 --> 31:18.528
and wipe it off and
you have a nice little outline

31:18.659 --> 31:20.052
where your mustard was.

31:20.182 --> 31:23.185
All right, I'm very, very,
very happy with that.

31:23.316 --> 31:25.840
That is wild.

31:27.842 --> 31:29.235
I've got this handle shaped,
now, on the belt grinder,

31:29.365 --> 31:31.367
And all I can think is--it's
just a piece of art.

31:31.498 --> 31:33.543
And to know that I made it
with these two hands.

31:33.674 --> 31:35.458
You know, that God's blessed me
with this ability,

31:35.589 --> 31:37.765
it's just overwhelming; the
emotion that starts building.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.201
Before I see this blade off,

31:39.332 --> 31:41.725
I've just got to test it
one time.

31:41.856 --> 31:44.946
And the blade just passes right
through like hot butter.

31:45.077 --> 31:46.905
Eat your heart out, El Cid.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.297
We got it done.

31:52.998 --> 31:55.043
- Brent, Thomas, welcome back
to The Forge.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.263
You boys have had four days
at your home forges

31:57.393 --> 31:58.481
to work on these swords.

31:58.612 --> 31:59.830
Brent, how did it go?

31:59.961 --> 32:01.049
- Absolute blast.

32:03.008 --> 32:05.227
Blade's made from 5160.

32:05.358 --> 32:07.099
The guard's mild steel.

32:07.229 --> 32:09.449
Pommel's mild steel,
leather-stacked handle.

32:09.579 --> 32:11.886
And the pattern on the blade
itself was a mustard patina.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.061
- All right.

32:13.192 --> 32:17.022
Thomas, what did you bring
for us?

32:17.152 --> 32:19.938
- I forged my blade from 5160.

32:20.068 --> 32:22.897
Forge-welded the guard
from four pieces.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.768
Made a slab handle
with poplar wood.

32:24.899 --> 32:27.597
Wrapped it in twine
and then leather.

32:27.728 --> 32:28.859
- All right, gentlemen.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.122
Your blades will
now be put through

32:30.252 --> 32:31.601
a series of
three tests.

32:31.732 --> 32:35.736
A strength test, a sharpness
test, up first--Doug?

32:38.347 --> 32:42.003
- All right, bladesmiths,
welcome to the KEAL test.

32:42.134 --> 32:44.223
To find out what kind of lethal
damage your weapons will do,

32:44.353 --> 32:46.442
I will take your weapons and
deliver some slash and thrusts

32:46.573 --> 32:47.791
on this boar carcass.

32:47.922 --> 32:49.358
- Brent, you're up first.
You ready for this?

32:49.489 --> 32:51.665
- Oh, yeah, let's do it
so my knees will stop shaking.

32:51.795 --> 32:53.797
- All right, let's do this.

32:53.928 --> 32:56.496
- My knees are playing
"Jingle Bells" right now.

32:56.626 --> 32:57.584
- That is a big pig.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.238
- Yeah.

32:59.368 --> 33:01.980
Doug's holding my Tizona in
his hands.

33:02.110 --> 33:04.504
"Oh, my goodness,
here it goes.

33:04.634 --> 33:05.940
It's really
gonna happen."

33:15.906 --> 33:16.777
Wow.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.055
Good job.

33:37.667 --> 33:40.366
- All right, Brent, let's talk
about your Tizona here.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.411
The balance of this blade
allows me

33:42.542 --> 33:43.934
to really move around
with it.

33:44.065 --> 33:47.155
And it's a very sharp
edge.

33:47.286 --> 33:49.244
Overall, this weapon is one
that you can move

33:49.375 --> 33:51.333
and bring to combat.

33:51.464 --> 33:52.726
And it will KEAL.

33:52.856 --> 33:54.858
- Thank you, sir.
- Good job.

33:54.989 --> 33:56.164
All right, Thomas, your turn.
You ready?

33:56.295 --> 33:57.557
- Ready as I'll ever be.

33:57.687 --> 33:58.601
- All right, let's do this.

34:00.168 --> 34:02.910
- Brent dropped this pig
twice.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.870
And his finish is just
absolutely perfect.

34:07.001 --> 34:11.179
It's stunning,
so when it comes down to it,

34:11.310 --> 34:13.964
You know, I'm gonna
have to win on performance.

34:42.732 --> 34:46.519
- Your tip thrusts easy
and cuts on the way out.

34:46.649 --> 34:49.261
And your edge, as you can see,
same number of cuts

34:49.391 --> 34:50.697
cut all the way through.

34:50.827 --> 34:52.046
Your first sword.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.569
It will KEAL.

34:53.700 --> 34:55.484
Good job.
- Thank you.

34:55.615 --> 34:56.964
- It's okay to be thrilled,
kid.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.923
Is it?

35:02.926 --> 35:04.580
- All right, gentlemen, it's
time for the strength test.

35:04.711 --> 35:06.365
The armor chop.

35:06.495 --> 35:08.193
To test the strength and
overall constion

35:08.323 --> 35:09.455
of your blades,
I'll be chopping into

35:09.585 --> 35:11.500
our armored knights here.

35:11.631 --> 35:12.762
Brent, you're up first,
you ready?

35:12.893 --> 35:14.547
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

35:14.677 --> 35:18.203
- I am nervous about
everything and anything.

35:18.333 --> 35:21.467
The smallest hit can 'cause
a blade to crack, shatter,

35:21.597 --> 35:23.686
break a handle, just anything.
Anything could happen.

35:23.817 --> 35:24.861
We don't know what's
going to happen here.

35:45.969 --> 35:47.101
- All right, Brent.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.625
You got a couple of chips
and rolls.

35:49.756 --> 35:52.628
I don't know that it'll affect
the performance of your blade.

35:52.759 --> 35:54.891
It's still sharp.

35:55.022 --> 35:56.154
As far as the design
of your blade,

35:56.284 --> 35:58.547
that's a
very slick handle.

35:58.678 --> 36:02.072
I like to not be able to do
that as easily.

36:02.203 --> 36:03.117
But you did good.

36:03.248 --> 36:04.727
Strong sword,
one piece.

36:04.858 --> 36:07.121
Good job.
- Thank you.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.471
- Thomas, are you ready?

36:09.602 --> 36:10.646
- I'm ready, swing away.

36:10.777 --> 36:11.778
- Okay.

36:34.322 --> 36:38.239
All right, Thomas, this has
a really fine edge to it.

36:38.370 --> 36:42.983
And where it made contact,
there are multiple rolls.

36:43.113 --> 36:45.507
It's that super fine edge
just being pushed over

36:45.638 --> 36:48.206
as it hits
that armor.

36:48.336 --> 36:51.034
It's an amazingly light sword
for as wide as that is.

36:51.165 --> 36:54.386
That's very good work; I mean,
it's a very broad blade,

36:54.516 --> 36:56.866
and it's got
a very light feel to it.

36:56.997 --> 36:58.955
The handle on this--the
wrapping on there

36:59.086 --> 37:00.305
gives a good grip.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.742
It felt really good in my hand.

37:02.872 --> 37:05.745
Bottom line--it's a strong
sword, held up beautifully.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.399
Good job.
- Thank you.

37:12.012 --> 37:14.580
- All right, bladesmiths.
This is the sharpness test.

37:14.710 --> 37:16.451
The fish slice.

37:16.582 --> 37:18.366
To test the edge of your
weapon, I will slash away

37:18.497 --> 37:20.238
at these salmons,

37:20.368 --> 37:21.239
Brett, you're first.
You ready?

37:21.369 --> 37:22.196
- Let's do it.

37:22.327 --> 37:23.197
- Good.

37:49.789 --> 37:51.181
Wow.

37:51.312 --> 37:52.661
Good job.

37:54.707 --> 37:57.057
- All right, Brent, let's talk
about your sword here.

37:57.187 --> 37:58.885
Cut all the way through the
fishes except for that.

37:59.015 --> 38:00.016
It's a sharp edge.

38:00.147 --> 38:01.670
All the cuts here
are very clean.

38:01.801 --> 38:04.282
Overall sir, it'll cut.

38:04.412 --> 38:06.327
- Awesome, thank you.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.764
- All right, Thomas.
Ready for sushi?

38:08.895 --> 38:10.375
- I am ready.

38:10.505 --> 38:11.941
- Let's do this.

38:12.072 --> 38:14.422
- It's really down to the wire
at this point.

38:14.553 --> 38:18.208
If my blade doesn't perform as
well as Brent's,

38:18.339 --> 38:19.949
I'm definitely out of
this competition.

38:43.103 --> 38:44.539
- Wow.

38:44.670 --> 38:45.497
Good job.

38:45.627 --> 38:46.585
- Thank you.

38:49.718 --> 38:52.199
- All right, Thomas.
Every cut was clean.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.983
All the way through.

38:54.114 --> 38:55.333
Once again, the edge here,

38:55.463 --> 38:57.117
despite some of the rolls it
took earlier,

38:57.247 --> 39:00.512
have no issues in performance
and quality of cuts.

39:00.642 --> 39:02.601
Overall, sir, it will cut.

39:02.731 --> 39:04.951
- Thank you.

39:05.081 --> 39:06.953
- So we're looking at--

39:07.083 --> 39:08.955
- It seems like it can go
either way.

39:09.085 --> 39:11.784
Brent's finish on his sword
was better.

39:11.914 --> 39:14.700
My handle was preferred,
maybe, slightly more.

39:14.830 --> 39:16.963
I just have a million things
going through my head,

39:17.093 --> 39:18.181
and I don't know
what to expect.

39:26.451 --> 39:29.758
- This is so, so close.

39:29.889 --> 39:31.325
It's down to the wire,
right now.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.849
I'm so excited and nervous
for this.

39:33.980 --> 39:36.678
I just wish I could be
over there, listening.

39:41.161 --> 39:42.641
- All right, bladesmiths.

39:42.771 --> 39:45.034
When the judges and I discuss
your weapon's performance,

39:45.165 --> 39:47.428
we're looking at how they
performed in the tests.

39:47.559 --> 39:48.821
Equally.

39:48.951 --> 39:51.389
We're looking at how they
function and move

39:51.519 --> 39:53.347
when they're
wielded and engage targets.

39:53.478 --> 39:54.783
Equally.

39:54.914 --> 39:57.525
And then we have to look
at craftsmanship.

39:57.656 --> 39:59.571
The new "Forged in Fire"
champion is...

40:02.487 --> 40:04.010
Brent, congratulations.

40:04.140 --> 40:05.707
You're the new "Forged in Fire"
champion.

40:05.838 --> 40:09.276
Thomas, this came down
to the finest of details.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.148
Your blade performed very well.
It was sharp.

40:12.279 --> 40:13.367
It was strong.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.195
It held up through
all of our tests.

40:15.325 --> 40:19.591
Unfortunately, a setback in
your home forge cost you

40:19.721 --> 40:23.203
a little bit of detail when it
came to your final product.

40:23.333 --> 40:25.335
And for that reason, please
leave The Forge.

40:27.294 --> 40:29.122
- I'm super disappointed
that I didn't win.

40:29.252 --> 40:32.473
But I came out here. I made
a knife with a drum set.

40:32.604 --> 40:35.258
I made a sword
for the first time.

40:35.389 --> 40:38.958
I'm just so proud of myself
for having taken the risk,

40:39.088 --> 40:41.743
putting myself
outside of my comfort zone,

40:41.874 --> 40:44.572
and right now I feel
like a rock star.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.054
- Brent, congratulations.

40:48.184 --> 40:49.795
You are the "Forged in Fire"
champion,

40:49.925 --> 40:52.493
and that's a title that comes
with a check for $10,000.

40:52.624 --> 40:53.625
Good job, my friend.

40:56.584 --> 40:57.933
How do you feel right now?

40:58.064 --> 40:59.979
- Aw, my knees are still
shaking; they haven't stopped.

41:00.109 --> 41:01.459
All right.

41:01.589 --> 41:03.243
Come on forward; let me hold
you up for a second.

41:05.071 --> 41:06.464
- Aw, it feels amazing.

41:06.594 --> 41:07.682
The adrenaline right now

41:07.813 --> 41:09.597
is just through
the friggin' roof.

41:09.728 --> 41:11.469
I'd like to thank God
for this opportunity,

41:11.599 --> 41:13.383
my wife for her support.

41:15.255 --> 41:16.909
Just thank you, everyone.

41:17.039 --> 41:18.911
I'm having trouble containing
everything.

41:19.041 --> 41:21.130
There's so many emotions
inside right now

41:21.261 --> 41:22.958
that I just wanna let
them all out.

41:23.089 --> 41:24.394
Yeah!

41:24.525 --> 41:25.395
Ooh.
