00:02.433 --> 00:03.466
[telephone ringing]

00:03.533 --> 00:05.833
Ooh, if that's Regine again,
I'm still busy.

00:05.900 --> 00:07.566
She wants to crash
my interview with Grant Hill.

00:07.633 --> 00:09.666
‐ And I ain't havin' it.
‐ Okay.

00:09.733 --> 00:11.566
"Flavor!" Hello!

00:11.633 --> 00:13.766
Hello?

00:13.833 --> 00:16.433
Khadijah, I think it's Regine
holding her breath again.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.533
For the last time,
Regine, no, you can't go.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.600
And I don't care
if you turn blue.

00:24.666 --> 00:26.600
It's actually a good color
for you.

00:29.800 --> 00:30.766
Whoa.

00:30.833 --> 00:32.800
So this is
the legendary "Flavor."

00:32.866 --> 00:35.000
No, this is the real one.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.466
I have a package
for Khadijah James.

00:39.533 --> 00:40.933
I'm Khadijah.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.866
Yes, you are.

00:42.933 --> 00:46.000
And I am a really,
really big fan of your writing.

00:46.066 --> 00:48.433
And you are too fine.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.133
Oh.
I‐I‐I shouldn't have said that.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.100
I'm sorry
that was unprofessional of me.

00:52.166 --> 00:54.433
And now I'm commenting on it.
I'm an idiot, huh.

00:55.566 --> 00:57.533
‐ Who are you?
‐ I'm Ivan Ennis.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.800
Four time
NYU journalism student.

00:59.866 --> 01:01.140
Part time bike messenger.

01:01.206 --> 01:03.140
And, uh, I'm sweating
profusely right now.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.606
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for an interview.

01:07.673 --> 01:09.039
Oh, uh.. Can I give you ride?

01:09.106 --> 01:11.073
I could go home
and get my parents' car.

01:15.340 --> 01:17.940
My‐my parents' car, uh..
I sound young, huh?

01:19.973 --> 01:21.306
Yeah, you do.

01:23.473 --> 01:24.840
She touched me.

02:12.446 --> 02:14.046
(Regine)
I've got it!

02:18.046 --> 02:19.513
‐ What are you doing here?
‐ Shh!

02:19.579 --> 02:21.346
They think I'm a guardian.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.113
Oh, better luck next time,
sweetheart.

02:28.013 --> 02:30.413
I'm gonna make a great mommy.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.980
[whistling]

02:32.046 --> 02:33.546
Now, listen up, troops.

02:33.613 --> 02:36.480
A 15‐minute break
before your music lesson

02:36.546 --> 02:39.146
ankle wraps
and metronomes for everyone.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.346
Is one of you ladies,
Khadijah James?

02:44.413 --> 02:46.280
I am Khadijah James,
"Flavor" magazine.

02:46.346 --> 02:48.346
And this is Regine.
She was just leaving.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.646
Oh, "The Air Up There."

02:56.880 --> 02:59.213
Why don't you try
to air out there?

03:04.086 --> 03:06.420
‐ Why don't you sit down?
‐ Cool.

03:06.486 --> 03:10.586
Uh, so, Grant, a summer camp
for basketball...and piano?

03:10.653 --> 03:11.920
They're both loves of mine.

03:11.986 --> 03:14.053
And playing the piano
can improve basketball skills.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.153
Oh, how's that?

03:15.220 --> 03:16.253
If you don't practice piano

03:16.320 --> 03:17.453
you're not allowed to play
basketball.

03:17.520 --> 03:18.486
[laughs]

03:18.553 --> 03:20.120
My mother was the same way.

03:20.186 --> 03:21.253
She won't let me touch the chord

03:21.320 --> 03:23.286
until I practiced
my stupid French horn.

03:23.353 --> 03:24.486
Do you still play?

03:24.553 --> 03:26.186
I can play "Greensleeves."

03:27.553 --> 03:28.786
No, I meant basketball.

03:28.853 --> 03:32.153
Oh! Well, you know,
not as much as I used to.

03:32.220 --> 03:34.220
Although in some circles,
I am known as

03:34.286 --> 03:36.653
Khadijah "All Chain" James.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.120
Keek‐keek.

03:39.886 --> 03:40.920
Really?

03:40.986 --> 03:42.220
Okay, All Chain.

03:42.286 --> 03:44.353
show me what you've got.

03:44.420 --> 03:45.653
Well, alright

03:45.720 --> 03:47.820
but don't take it easy on me.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.920
Not bad. Try again.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.320
This time,
I'm going to the hole.

03:56.386 --> 03:57.653
Okay.

04:03.126 --> 04:04.526
[moaning]

04:05.826 --> 04:07.993
Foul!

04:11.793 --> 04:13.560
Khadijah, are you okay?

04:13.626 --> 04:14.793
Yeah, I'm okay.

04:14.860 --> 04:16.726
‐ Good. 'Cause I'm not.
‐ Oh!

04:16.793 --> 04:18.760
Oh! Father!

04:18.826 --> 04:21.760
It's okay,
Regine is right here, honey.

04:24.926 --> 04:27.560
Um. Um. Um.

04:27.626 --> 04:29.560
Duh. A‐a dancing pancreas.

04:31.793 --> 04:32.860
Okay, come on, Obie.

04:32.926 --> 04:34.626
Do that focusing exercise
I taught you.

04:34.693 --> 04:36.093
Pull on your ears.

04:38.326 --> 04:39.760
"The Postman
Always Rings Twice!"

04:39.826 --> 04:41.060
‐ That's it!
‐ Yes! Yes!

04:41.126 --> 04:42.393
[laughing]

04:45.326 --> 04:47.293
Yes!

04:47.360 --> 04:48.960
(Synclaire)
'Yes!'

04:49.026 --> 04:51.126
Well, let' see..

04:51.193 --> 04:54.093
Synclaire and I have won
four games in a row

04:54.160 --> 04:58.160
while you and Max have zip,
nada, the big goose egg.

04:58.226 --> 04:59.660
Somebody stop me!

04:59.726 --> 05:01.000
[laughing]

05:02.833 --> 05:05.766
You know, it is incomprehensible
that these two have beaten us..

05:05.833 --> 05:07.333
...consistently.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.500
Are you brainiacs trying to say
that we can't beat you

05:10.566 --> 05:13.333
at something...brainiacish?

05:15.500 --> 05:17.333
In your language, yeses.

05:19.333 --> 05:21.333
Choose your weapon.

05:21.400 --> 05:25.500
The confounding anagrams
of Scrabble or Jeopardy?

05:25.566 --> 05:27.800
Where agony
takes the form of a question.

05:30.166 --> 05:31.533
Alright, look, forget Scrabble.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.366
They put down "She"
we turn it in to shenanigan

05:33.433 --> 05:34.800
it's over before
we can enjoy it.

05:34.866 --> 05:36.133
Psst.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.600
Jeopardy.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.666
Set it off.

05:44.466 --> 05:46.600
Hey, how'd it go
with Grant Hill?

05:46.666 --> 05:47.866
Go ahead!

05:47.933 --> 05:49.533
All Chain, tell 'em.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.666
Well, well, we, we ha‐played
a little game one‐on‐one

05:55.733 --> 05:56.900
and then we had a collision.

05:56.966 --> 05:59.633
I try to see him at the hospital
but they won't let me.

06:01.173 --> 06:03.940
They wouldn't even let him
see his fiance

06:04.006 --> 06:06.006
the future Regine Hunter Hill.

06:07.573 --> 06:10.206
Regine, you are an embarrassment
to desperate women everywhere.

06:16.940 --> 06:21.306
Grant Hill is the kind of man
that I am destined to be with.

06:21.373 --> 06:23.206
Alright, he is,
he is intelligent.

06:23.273 --> 06:25.406
He is handsome, refined.

06:25.473 --> 06:28.006
Worth 45 million.

06:28.073 --> 06:31.540
A nice cushion for a young
couple just getting started.

06:33.506 --> 06:34.906
[telephone ringing]

06:36.640 --> 06:38.473
Hello. Grant?

06:38.540 --> 06:39.973
Oh, my God,
I'm so glad you called.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.440
I'm sorry about what happened.
What did the doctor say?

06:42.506 --> 06:43.806
It's just a sprain, I'm fine

06:43.873 --> 06:45.873
expect for this dress
they got me wearing.

06:47.306 --> 06:50.206
Lord, five minutes with Khadijah
and the man's in a dress.

06:53.206 --> 06:55.240
You know, Khadijah,
I still owe you that interview

06:55.306 --> 06:57.840
but this place and the hotel
are swarming with the media.

06:57.906 --> 06:59.240
How about I come to your place?

06:59.306 --> 07:01.346
‐ Brooklyn, right?
‐ How did you know that?

07:01.413 --> 07:02.780
When I was on the stretcher,
your roommate

07:02.846 --> 07:04.780
slipped me the address
and phone number.

07:06.213 --> 07:08.680
Along with the list of her
favorite baby names.

07:08.746 --> 07:10.380
(Khadijah)
'W‐when will you be out?'

07:11.313 --> 07:13.646
Oh, how about 8:30?

07:13.713 --> 07:15.880
Alright, I'll see you then. Bye.

07:16.946 --> 07:18.880
Perfect. Just enough time for me

07:18.946 --> 07:22.413
to get a manicure,
pedicure and facial.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.113
[chuckles]
Manicure and pedicure.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.880
That little imp can buff
her body all she wants

07:30.946 --> 07:32.780
but Grant's coming to see you.

07:32.846 --> 07:35.013
So you might want to think about
tightening up the hair a bit.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.146
You know.

07:43.946 --> 07:45.013
Mmm.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.280
I love it when Regine
sets her man trap.

07:47.346 --> 07:48.913
She makes the best stuff.

07:50.246 --> 07:52.280
Too bad for her Grant likes you.

07:52.346 --> 07:53.646
[chuckles]

07:53.713 --> 07:55.380
Why you keep saying that?

07:56.546 --> 07:58.413
You think?

07:58.480 --> 08:01.186
Yes!
Yes, and I hope you go for it.

08:01.253 --> 08:03.386
You know, since Scooter left,
you've been living like a nun

08:03.453 --> 08:04.686
but a lot less fun.

08:06.086 --> 08:09.153
Okay, Synclaire, I want you
to put that right here.

08:09.220 --> 08:11.953
I want the aroma to waft
into Grant's nose.

08:12.653 --> 08:13.620
Mmm!

08:13.686 --> 08:15.720
Alright, gumbo, my favorite.

08:17.620 --> 08:19.553
I thought you hated gumbo.

08:19.620 --> 08:21.753
Dumbo. Alright, I hate dumbo.

08:25.153 --> 08:26.620
Hey, hey.

08:26.686 --> 08:28.220
What are y'all doing here?

08:28.286 --> 08:30.086
We want Grant to sign this.

08:30.153 --> 08:33.153
And I'm here to watch Overton
make a fool of himself.

08:33.220 --> 08:36.486
You wanna give him a few
pointers, Mr. Dancing Pancreas?

08:39.385 --> 08:40.686
[doorbell ringing]

08:43.285 --> 08:44.953
‐ Hey!
‐ Hi, how are you doing?

08:45.020 --> 08:46.286
Well, meet my friends.

08:46.353 --> 08:47.953
You already know Regine.

08:48.020 --> 08:50.753
That's Synclaire, Max, Kyle,
and this is Overton.

08:50.820 --> 08:54.653
Hey, homie, um, can you make
this out "To my best pal Obie

08:54.720 --> 08:56.653
thanks for fixing
my garbage disposal?"

08:59.086 --> 09:00.426
That's different.

09:04.960 --> 09:08.026
You know, I saw you
in a magazine wearing Massimo.

09:08.093 --> 09:10.226
You wear it well as I.

09:10.293 --> 09:12.826
Actually I find Massimo
a little pretentious.

09:12.893 --> 09:14.726
[chuckles]
Exactly.

09:17.793 --> 09:19.560
I made your favorite.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.760
Gumbo!

09:21.826 --> 09:25.160
Mmm. Nothing like gumbo
and cornbread.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.160
Cornbread, coming right up.

09:31.326 --> 09:32.793
Come on, have a seat.

09:35.626 --> 09:37.093
Ah‐ah‐ah‐ah‐ah‐ah‐ah.

09:45.993 --> 09:47.260
Grant Hill.

09:57.860 --> 09:59.500
Oh‐oh. Ooh. Okay! Okay.

10:02.033 --> 10:03.966
Grant, I really feel bad
about what happened.

10:04.033 --> 10:06.466
Don't. You gave me an excuse
to see you again.

10:10.733 --> 10:12.600
Well...hooh.

10:12.666 --> 10:14.066
Um..

10:14.133 --> 10:16.333
Let's get started.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.333
Even though you're one
of the most popular players

10:18.400 --> 10:21.600
in the league, you still go to
restaurants and movies alone?

10:21.666 --> 10:24.433
The truth is, I'm kind of shy.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.733
Come on, you've been on more TV
than Johnnie Cochran.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.133
Every time
I do one of these things

10:31.200 --> 10:32.833
I break in to a cold sweat.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.200
Really?

10:34.266 --> 10:36.100
Definitely. You think it's easy?

10:36.166 --> 10:38.666
Let me ask you a few questions?

10:38.733 --> 10:41.666
When you go to movies or
restaurants, do you go alone?

10:44.900 --> 10:46.200
Sometimes.

10:49.966 --> 10:53.100
So, there's no one in particular
you always go with?

10:58.633 --> 11:00.640
It's a little warm in here.

11:03.206 --> 11:04.406
Uh‐huh.

11:04.473 --> 11:05.540
Oh.

11:14.606 --> 11:16.040
Got you hiding for..

11:16.106 --> 11:19.040
[screaming]
No!

11:24.973 --> 11:26.906
I hope you realize
that your lips

11:26.973 --> 11:29.106
are compromising
your journalistic integrity.

11:29.173 --> 11:32.206
Yes. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes. It's about time. Listen.

11:32.273 --> 11:35.440
Uh‐uh, I think, l‐let's go pull
Regine's head out of the oven.

11:35.506 --> 11:36.440
Alright, eh?

11:36.506 --> 11:37.506
[laughing]

11:37.573 --> 11:39.506
‐ Behave yourself.
‐ No. Go, go, go.

11:39.573 --> 11:40.706
Yes.

11:41.606 --> 11:43.506
G‐Grant, you gotta excuse me.

11:43.573 --> 11:46.640
I'm‐I'm really not
this unprofessional.

make it into a real date.

12:04.913 --> 12:06.213

12:07.346 --> 12:09.746
What about the interview?

12:09.813 --> 12:12.180
Let's just say I feel blessed
to have an opportunity

12:12.246 --> 12:13.646
to play a game I love.

12:14.846 --> 12:16.113
Good enough for me.

12:24.780 --> 12:26.713
Don't screw it up for us again.

the concept of teamwork, do you?

the other person chills.

12:38.713 --> 12:41.580
I'll chill
when you start playing.

Come on, come on, come on, come
on, we're getting old over here.

12:45.180 --> 12:49.646
Uh, half the battle is pulling
out the perfect piece.

12:49.713 --> 12:51.246
Oh‐ho!

12:51.313 --> 12:55.046
And the other half is putting
it in the perfect place.

12:57.346 --> 13:00.120
Your turn, Obie.
Bring it home to mama.

13:02.220 --> 13:03.486
Alrighty.

13:18.486 --> 13:20.586
Why did you pick this game?

13:20.653 --> 13:22.753
How was I suppose to know
he'd be a Jenga genius?

13:24.020 --> 13:25.453
The game is made out of wood.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.520
He's a handyman.
What do you wanna play next?

13:27.586 --> 13:29.520
"Let's go build a redwood deck?"

13:30.620 --> 13:32.053
Go on, take your turn, woman.

Miss James,
I need you to sign for this.

14:35.593 --> 14:37.360
Mh! What penmanship!

14:37.426 --> 14:39.860

you have a nice 'S.'

Khadijah,
I better get going now.

14:50.893 --> 14:52.226

15:25.900 --> 15:28.233
I thought it'd be appropriate
to spend it where we met.

15:28.300 --> 15:30.233
It's a good thing
we didn't meet in an alley.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.100
For you.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.366
A different flower for every day
we spent together.

at half court before.
