(Roger mumbling,
typing on keyboard)

01:15.080 --> 01:17.250
Oh, come on, Roger,
you need an ending!

01:17.250 --> 01:19.040
Come on!

01:19.040 --> 01:21.620
Anita, Cruella's not here yet,
is she?

01:21.620 --> 01:23.330
Anita: Not yet!

01:23.330 --> 01:24.540
Whew!

01:26.120 --> 01:28.380
Huh?

01:28.380 --> 01:30.670
Nanny and her crazy inventions.

01:31.790 --> 01:34.580
Nanny is nothing
if not resourceful.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.120
Roger:
A catapult... perfect!

01:45.000 --> 01:49.290
Oh, come on, you darn old
temperamental machine!

01:53.120 --> 01:56.040
Lucky:
Chow Tower or bust.

01:56.040 --> 01:59.420
Cadet Lucky, ready for launch.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.080
Copy that!

02:01.080 --> 02:03.080
Commencing lunch sequence.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.540
Sorry, launch sequence.

02:05.540 --> 02:07.620
Grrrrr!

02:07.620 --> 02:09.040
Wait! Abort! Abort!

02:09.040 --> 02:11.960
My calculations show
you're too light.

02:11.960 --> 02:15.120
I figure you need
108 pounds.

02:15.120 --> 02:19.080
Oh, man, how am I gonna
carry that much weight?

02:20.790 --> 02:23.330
Incoming!
Sounds like Cruella.

02:23.330 --> 02:24.540
Whoa!

02:38.920 --> 02:40.620
Whoaaaa!

02:44.620 --> 02:48.250
Thank goodness, none of those
annoying puppies underfoot.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.790
Lucky:
Yaaaaah!

02:52.000 --> 02:54.460
Oh! Ptooey!

02:54.460 --> 02:55.750
Ohh!

02:59.880 --> 03:00.960
Arrgh!

03:00.960 --> 03:02.460
That does it!

03:02.460 --> 03:06.210
I've had it up to here with you
and your reckless driving, lady!

03:06.210 --> 03:10.080
This is our driveway!
Why, I oughta...

03:11.790 --> 03:16.420
I have had it up to here with
you always being in my way!

03:16.420 --> 03:19.500
Driveways are for cars,
not dogs!

03:19.500 --> 03:21.790
-I ought to--

03:21.790 --> 03:23.460
I thought
I heard you
pull up.

03:23.460 --> 03:25.880
Hello, Anita, darling!

03:25.880 --> 03:29.540
Just spending some
quality time with your...

03:29.540 --> 03:31.040
dogs.

03:34.880 --> 03:38.830
Is Rump Roast ready
for my weekly inspection

03:38.830 --> 03:40.920
of his doomed business?

03:40.920 --> 03:43.250
Uh, yes,
I think so.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.830
He's got an exciting
new video game
to show you.

03:51.670 --> 03:53.380
I hope.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.830
Whooo! Done.
I hope.

04:00.830 --> 04:02.170
Aha!

04:04.460 --> 04:06.960
Oh, love what you've done
with your hair, Cruella.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.830
Cruella: Can it, Red Robin,
I haven't much time.

04:09.830 --> 04:13.620
So dazzle me with this year's
massive tax write-off.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.710
Well, I think this game
is revolutionary.

04:16.710 --> 04:18.210
It takes a new approach
to winning

04:18.210 --> 04:20.210
and encourages
sportsmanship.

04:20.210 --> 04:21.960
Cruella: Hmm...

04:24.830 --> 04:26.960
I am Barkio.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.000
Enter my world if you dare.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.750
My adventure began
innocently enough

04:31.750 --> 04:33.830
when I was burying a bone.

04:33.830 --> 04:37.620
Oh, I see you've used
your shabby little farm
as a setting.

04:37.620 --> 04:38.790
How banal.

04:38.790 --> 04:40.330
Just wait.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.170
I discovered an energy portal
to an alternate universe,

04:46.170 --> 04:49.330
like this one
and yet unlike.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.790
Cruella: Hmm.

04:59.620 --> 05:02.210
Rolly: That looks like
Cruella's house.

05:02.210 --> 05:04.830
Uh-huh. Before
she changed the style

05:04.830 --> 05:06.710
from early
Gothic strange

05:06.710 --> 05:08.250
to late, weird
and tasteless.

05:08.250 --> 05:11.000
Hey, that looks like
our farm.

05:14.170 --> 05:18.750
Now my only way back home is to
master this world's many realms

05:18.750 --> 05:21.790
and find the mystical
hidden portal.

05:21.790 --> 05:23.620
Cool!

05:23.620 --> 05:25.420
But first I must survive

05:25.420 --> 05:27.880
the mean streets
of Cyber Grutely,

05:27.880 --> 05:30.710
escape the evil halls
of De Vil-a-Villa,

05:30.710 --> 05:34.040
and survive the final
otherworldly battle

05:34.040 --> 05:36.420
at Dearly Departed Farm.

05:36.420 --> 05:39.880
Well, I see you've written
what you know.

05:39.880 --> 05:44.420
Unfortunately, Ringworm,
what you know is
incredibly boring.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.880
Lucky: ...and at each level,
I must do battle

05:47.880 --> 05:52.620
with my evil arch enemy,
De Villa the Cruel!

05:52.620 --> 05:56.170
Ah, at last,
a likable character!

05:57.210 --> 06:00.500
Oh, I have
gotta play this!

06:00.500 --> 06:03.380
No, Lucky, this isn't
a game for pets.

06:03.380 --> 06:04.790
Cruella: It's mine!

06:04.790 --> 06:07.830
No, Cruella,
this isn't
a game for pests...

06:07.830 --> 06:09.500
uh, fashion
designers.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.710
I mean,
the computer has
been sort of buggy.

06:11.710 --> 06:14.540
Odd power surges.
And I just now
wrote the ending.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.710
Why, I could swear
that little monster
was challenging me.

06:20.710 --> 06:23.290
Anita:
Roger, telephone!

06:23.290 --> 06:24.670
Uh, just a minute.

06:24.670 --> 06:27.460
It's the computer
game company!

06:27.460 --> 06:30.080
Oh, I gotta take this.
I'll be right back.

06:32.250 --> 06:35.080
Does anyone else
sense tension here?

06:37.170 --> 06:40.580
I'll beat the fur off of you,
you miserable mutt.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.620
man:
Beginning 2 player game.

06:46.620 --> 06:50.790
Oh, must be one of those power
surges Roger was talking about.

06:57.750 --> 07:01.420
Now that's what you
call interactive.

07:02.750 --> 07:03.620
-Ohhhh!
-Whoaaa!

07:06.040 --> 07:07.710
I am Barkio.

07:07.710 --> 07:10.540
Hey, I am Barkio.

07:10.540 --> 07:13.000
This is totally rad!

07:13.000 --> 07:14.500
Don't be absurd.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.080
You're one of Anita
and Rollo's pups, and I'm--

07:17.080 --> 07:18.920
My heavens, you're talking!

07:18.920 --> 07:21.580
Well, duh, we're
in a video game.

07:21.580 --> 07:23.000
Anything can happen.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.750
Dogs can talk,
fish can walk.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.790
Pigs can fly.

07:32.710 --> 07:35.580
Streets can roll up
like carpets.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.710
Jump!

07:38.330 --> 07:40.250
Inside a video game?

07:40.250 --> 07:43.790
Oh, that's ridiculous!
Preposterous.

07:43.790 --> 07:46.880
What on earth
makes you think
that

07:48.080 --> 07:49.460
Aaah!

07:49.460 --> 07:51.580
Lucky: It's the back side
of the computer screen.

07:51.580 --> 07:52.920
That's Roger's office.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.170
Oh!

07:57.880 --> 07:59.670
Luck, are you okay?

07:59.670 --> 08:03.920
Okay? He's been transformed
into so much ASCII code.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.120
Maybe there's something
in Roger's notebook
about this.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.000
Roger calling this computer
"sort of buggy"

08:10.000 --> 08:13.790
is like saying Cruella
is kind of selfish.

08:13.790 --> 08:17.750
Lucky: Oh, I'm fine.
I'll just jump back through.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.830
Ugggh...

08:21.620 --> 08:23.710
Ouch! Or not.

08:23.710 --> 08:25.620
We'll just turn
the computer off.

08:25.620 --> 08:27.210
That should do
the trick.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.880
No, turn it back on!

08:34.540 --> 08:37.620
It says here that
during a cold power-down,

08:37.620 --> 08:39.620
all game data is erased!

08:39.620 --> 08:41.540
That means Lucky
and Cruella.

08:41.540 --> 08:43.790
As in, game over!

08:43.790 --> 08:45.540
Roger: Okay, I'm back.
Let's...

08:45.540 --> 08:49.170
Cruella left? Huh.
How rude.

08:49.170 --> 08:51.080
Oh, maybe she went
downstairs.

08:51.080 --> 08:53.120
Spot:
Roger, no, don't!

08:53.120 --> 08:54.710
Wait, don't go!

08:54.710 --> 08:57.290
Lucky's trapped in
the computer with
Cruella, and...

08:58.750 --> 09:01.880
Okay, okay, shoo!
Everybody out of the way.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.960
No! Roger!
Roger!

09:04.960 --> 09:06.620
both: Wait!

09:11.250 --> 09:14.500
Uh, guess we'll have to figure
our own way out.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.620
Uh, let's see.

09:16.620 --> 09:18.580
In the game intro,
Barkio said

09:18.580 --> 09:21.580
you have to find
the secret portal to get home.

09:21.580 --> 09:25.210
Maybe if we find it,
we'll get out of the computer.

09:25.210 --> 09:27.830
I can't believe I'm taking
survival advice

09:27.830 --> 09:30.500
from something in a flea collar.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.080
Well, what are we
waiting for?

09:32.080 --> 09:34.920
Only problem is,
we're in a two-player game,

09:34.920 --> 09:37.960
which means
only one of us can win.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.460
I see!

09:40.460 --> 09:42.540
man: Round 1!

09:42.540 --> 09:45.040
Aaah! The game's
beginning.

09:52.620 --> 09:56.580
Barkio must engage Cruella
in hand-to-paw combat

09:56.580 --> 09:59.620
and win a ride
with the motorcycle gang.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.830
Haa! Kii! Waa!

10:04.830 --> 10:07.380
Yow! Woo! Waza!

10:07.380 --> 10:08.500
Hara!

10:08.500 --> 10:11.120
Lucky's goin' at it
with Cruella.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.710
He must be
lovin' this!

10:12.710 --> 10:15.000
Rolly, Rolly, Rolly.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.710
Don't you know that
communication,

10:17.710 --> 10:19.790
not violence,
is the key

10:19.790 --> 10:22.420
to peaceful resolution
of conflict?

10:22.420 --> 10:24.540
Turn the other cheek,
Lucky!

10:24.540 --> 10:26.290
B-b-bad news, guys.

10:26.290 --> 10:29.380
According to Roger's notes,
Barkio has to defeat Cruella

10:29.380 --> 10:31.880
at each contest, or else...

10:31.880 --> 10:33.620
game over!

10:33.620 --> 10:34.460
Kill her, Lucky!

10:36.040 --> 10:37.880
Kick her pants, Lucky!

10:38.920 --> 10:41.380
Yaaa!
Hyaaa!

10:41.380 --> 10:43.380
You don't stand a chance.

10:49.420 --> 10:52.290
You stink!

10:52.290 --> 10:54.960
Unsportswomanlike conduct.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.960
Round 1 goes to Barkio
by default.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.500
Ohh!

11:05.620 --> 11:07.500
Aaaah!

11:11.420 --> 11:15.250
Since when do
motorcycle gangs
value fighting fair?

11:15.250 --> 11:19.080
Remember, Roger
wrote this game.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.540
Oh, yeah.
Question answered.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.710
Uggh!

11:31.880 --> 11:34.380
Round 2,
De Vil-a-Villa.

11:34.380 --> 11:37.670
Barkio must navigate from
the front door to the back door

11:37.670 --> 11:41.330
without setting eyes
on the no-makeup
Cruella Medusa.

11:45.540 --> 11:46.540
Ooooh!

11:48.460 --> 11:52.460
Memo to myself:
vaporize hairdresser.

11:52.460 --> 11:56.420
Yes, Roger, how do you
really feel about Cruella?

11:56.420 --> 11:58.380
Oh, Roger's notes say

11:58.380 --> 12:01.120
that if Lucky sees
the Cruella Medusa,

12:01.120 --> 12:03.380
he turns to stone
and it's...

12:03.380 --> 12:05.500
Wait, let us guess.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.460
both: Game over!

12:07.460 --> 12:10.170
You have to get
through Cruella's house

12:10.170 --> 12:11.380
to the back door, Lucky!

12:11.380 --> 12:12.750
Rolly: And whatever happens,

12:12.750 --> 12:15.500
don't look
at the Cruella Medusa!

12:15.500 --> 12:19.040
No problem. I've snuck
into this place so many times,

12:19.040 --> 12:21.380
I know it like
the back of my paw.

12:24.330 --> 12:25.380
Huh?

12:29.250 --> 12:32.120
Oops. Hee hee.
Someone remodeled.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.710
I think it's this way.

12:35.710 --> 12:38.500
It's like a modern art painting.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.500
I hate modern art.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.790
Rolly: Look out!

12:50.790 --> 12:52.540
Take a look at me!

12:54.380 --> 12:56.330
A good hard look!

13:16.000 --> 13:19.120
Whaaaa!

13:20.710 --> 13:24.330
That's the Zombie Army of
Dress Dummy Cruella Medusas!

13:24.330 --> 13:26.330
Who thinks of this stuff?

13:26.330 --> 13:29.460
B-b-but one of them
is the real thing!

13:31.250 --> 13:33.040
Look out!
It's that one!

13:33.040 --> 13:36.170
Cadpig: No, that one, left!
Rolly: No, right!

13:37.830 --> 13:38.920
Haaa!

13:40.460 --> 13:42.330
both: Look out!

13:48.250 --> 13:50.040
Whoaaaaa!

13:52.210 --> 13:55.330
Whoaaaaa!

13:58.120 --> 13:59.670
Thanks, guys.

13:59.670 --> 14:00.710
Hey!

14:00.710 --> 14:02.790
You're in the game, too!

14:02.790 --> 14:06.000
Oh, no, I'm not very
good at video games.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.420
And if we're stuck
in here,

14:07.420 --> 14:09.210
that means Spot
is left...

14:09.210 --> 14:11.120
alone!

14:11.120 --> 14:13.580
Excuse me a moment.

14:23.750 --> 14:26.080
Aaaaaaa...!

14:27.170 --> 14:29.460
There. I feel much better now.

14:29.460 --> 14:32.580
After all,
it can't get any worse.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.210
Anita: Roger,
dinner's almost ready.

14:35.210 --> 14:38.750
Coming! I'm just gonna shut down
the computer.

14:38.750 --> 14:39.960
No!

14:41.830 --> 14:44.330
We have to find the back door.

14:50.540 --> 14:52.290
all: There it is!

14:58.920 --> 15:00.750
Okay, it's worse.

15:04.290 --> 15:06.290
I'm sure to win.

15:13.330 --> 15:14.250
What?

15:20.330 --> 15:24.540
I can't remember the last time
I enjoyed a bad hair day.

15:26.460 --> 15:28.540
-Lucky: There's the door.

15:28.540 --> 15:30.290
Dive for it!

15:34.170 --> 15:35.380
Aha!

15:35.380 --> 15:36.830
Aaaaaa!

15:41.710 --> 15:43.960
Ohhh!

15:48.540 --> 15:51.170
Second round to Barkio!

15:51.170 --> 15:53.170
-All right!
-Excellent!

15:53.170 --> 15:56.000
What happened?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.120
I turned off the brightness.

15:57.120 --> 16:00.120
So we couldn't see
the Cruella Medusa.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.290
Quick thinkin', Spot!

16:02.290 --> 16:04.580
You guys better hurry!
I don't know how much longer

16:04.580 --> 16:06.710
I can keep Roger from
shutting down the computer!

16:06.710 --> 16:09.960
Lucky: Come on, the last level
is at the virtual farm.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.330
Aaaah!

16:11.330 --> 16:13.330
Cruella

16:18.540 --> 16:19.710
Uggh!

16:22.250 --> 16:24.960
How do I get locked out
of the office?

16:26.500 --> 16:29.290
Wasting energy.
Ah, what a day!

16:31.000 --> 16:33.120
The third and final round.

16:34.420 --> 16:35.920
Armageddon!

16:35.920 --> 16:38.880
Oh, that sounds
encouraging.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.170
Barkio must compete
against Cruella

16:41.170 --> 16:43.880
in the battle
to end all battles,

16:43.880 --> 16:47.120
here, in the driveway
of Dearly Departed Farm.

16:50.460 --> 16:53.080
I am Barkio!

16:53.080 --> 16:55.250
Hey,
what's going on?

16:55.250 --> 16:57.250
We've all become Barkio.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.040
At last,
supreme oneness.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.540
Joinedness,
togetherness.

17:02.540 --> 17:04.330
When is it over?

17:04.330 --> 17:07.540
As soon as we win
this sucker.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.710
She's still here!

17:13.710 --> 17:15.170
She must be playing
the game up there.

17:15.170 --> 17:19.040
The woman simply won't
take no for an answer.

17:26.580 --> 17:28.380
-Ohhh!

17:28.380 --> 17:29.830
Aaaaah!

17:35.460 --> 17:37.040
Yowwww!

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
Let the battle for ultimate
control of the driveway begin!

17:45.040 --> 17:48.250
No fair, she gets
the lawnmower of death

17:48.250 --> 17:50.580
and we get a hay ride!

17:50.580 --> 17:52.000
If it makes
you feel better,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.460
think of it
as the hayride of death.

17:55.460 --> 17:56.920
Whoaaa!

18:01.540 --> 18:04.120
Let's try that pitchfork.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.460
Rolly: A direct hit!

18:10.460 --> 18:12.000
Ooh! Ooh!

18:15.380 --> 18:17.670
Whoo! Barkio!

18:21.710 --> 18:24.040
Lucky: She's digging up
Nanny's garden.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.920
Cadpig: Ooh, she's gonna get
in trouble.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.790
What's she
digging for?

18:28.790 --> 18:31.040
There's nothing
in Nanny's garden
but...

18:31.040 --> 18:32.670
worms.

18:34.380 --> 18:37.380
Cruella: I hope you enjoy
your virtual reality!

18:37.380 --> 18:39.960
Uh-oh.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.460
Out of ammo.

18:41.460 --> 18:44.250
The battle of the driveway
is mine!

18:44.250 --> 18:47.250
Only one of us will escape:
me!

18:47.250 --> 18:49.000
Aaaaaah!

18:53.040 --> 18:57.380
Prepare to be doomed
to computerized oblivion!

18:57.380 --> 18:59.960
Uh-oh! Looking bad
for the good guys.

18:59.960 --> 19:03.420
We can at least leave her
with a little egg on her face.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.420
Take that!

19:09.420 --> 19:12.880
Yes! The eggs are explosive.

19:12.880 --> 19:13.880
Cool!

19:18.080 --> 19:19.790
Fire at will!

19:21.330 --> 19:22.960
Whoa! Oh!

19:26.540 --> 19:28.580
I hope you like
your eggs scrambled!

19:41.250 --> 19:43.620
Round 3 to Barkio.

19:43.620 --> 19:45.710
Now for your final test.

19:45.710 --> 19:49.000
Find the secret portal
that will carry you home.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.580
Where could it be?

19:52.500 --> 19:55.000
Rolly:
It's Nanny's catapult.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.750
Roger said he'd just written
the ending.

19:56.750 --> 19:58.080
He must have been watching.

19:58.080 --> 20:01.960
And that means that the portal
is the Chow Tower window.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.540
Quick!

20:03.540 --> 20:06.710
No, wait!
Remember the weight!

20:06.710 --> 20:09.960
You need 108 more pounds!
Hurry up!

20:09.960 --> 20:12.880
Roger is determined
to shut this thing down!

20:18.210 --> 20:20.080
Is everything all right,
Roger?

20:20.080 --> 20:21.880
Fine!

20:24.000 --> 20:26.040
Rolly and I add
another 8 pounds.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.790
We need 100 more!

20:28.830 --> 20:30.420
How about Cruella?

20:30.420 --> 20:32.540
I bet she weighs
100 pounds.

20:32.540 --> 20:34.750
Yeah, so would
a bunch of rocks.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.880
I vote for the rocks.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.330
Come on, you guys.

20:38.330 --> 20:41.960
She's a pain,
but we can't
just leave her here.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.330
What are you doing?

20:46.330 --> 20:47.830
Get off of me!

20:47.830 --> 20:51.290
No, listen, this must be
the secret to the game.

20:51.290 --> 20:53.920
We have to cooperate
to get out.

20:55.580 --> 20:58.170
Cruella: How very Roger.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.380
all: Aaaaaaah!

21:17.960 --> 21:19.790
Nooooo!

21:26.210 --> 21:27.790
We did it!

21:27.790 --> 21:29.710
Now what's going on?

21:29.710 --> 21:31.750
(puppies yipping,
Cruella chuckling)

21:31.750 --> 21:33.920
Cruella? Is that
what you've been doing,

21:33.920 --> 21:35.830
playing with the puppies?

21:35.830 --> 21:37.620
It was
extraordinary, Rodman.

21:37.620 --> 21:39.960
We were inside
your video game!

21:39.960 --> 21:42.830
And your pups were talking
and then...

21:44.000 --> 21:45.920
Ahem! Don't be absurd.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.920
I was giving your video game
a test run, that's all.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.880
Well, it really wasn't
ready yet,

21:50.880 --> 21:52.330
but what did you think?

21:52.330 --> 21:57.080
Well, it teaches fair play,
cooperation, and teamwork.

21:57.080 --> 22:00.170
I didn't
much care for it.
