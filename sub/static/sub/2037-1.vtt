<i>Why don't I see you?</i>

04:17.040 --> 04:18.800
I'm at Bar Street.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.149
<i>I warn you, don't be late again.</i>

04:20.149 --> 04:21.860
Can't you be nice?

04:21.860 --> 04:23.790
<i>Today's meeting is important.</i>

04:23.790 --> 04:26.160
Why can't we talk at home?

04:27.080 --> 04:29.020
You haven't been home
in 6 months.

04:52.650 --> 04:55.780
<i>I've booked Room 7.</i>

04:55.780 --> 04:56.920
Wait there.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.480

05:16.910 --> 05:19.060

05:19.060 --> 05:20.960
Must I have one?

05:20.960 --> 05:22.620
One moment.

05:28.770 --> 05:31.610

05:54.330 --> 05:56.060
Sir, please check your coat there.

05:56.060 --> 05:57.850
Out of the way! What invitation!

05:58.640 --> 06:01.040

06:02.030 --> 06:03.190
Captain Zhong.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.960
Do you remember me?

06:05.960 --> 06:07.460
I'm TV host Zhu Nan.

06:07.460 --> 06:09.220
My partner, Quanzi, interviewed you.

06:09.220 --> 06:11.510
What case are you working on here?

06:11.510 --> 06:12.650
Personal stuff

06:12.680 --> 06:14.750
I understand. Police are people too.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.250
It's just that it's so hard
to get any news.

06:17.250 --> 06:19.750
I just interviewed a drunk dicer. The scum--

06:20.290 --> 06:21.790
Well talk later.

06:24.440 --> 06:25.600
Where is room 7?

06:25.600 --> 06:26.360
What?

06:26.360 --> 06:27.870
Room 7.

06:28.260 --> 06:29.650
That guy looking for Miao is here.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.480
Just a moment, Handsome.

06:44.230 --> 06:48.310
Life is like a cocktail,

06:48.730 --> 06:51.590
to be savored

06:52.230 --> 06:54.230
Thus drink be had any way
you want.

06:55.230 --> 06:56.730
This is our Boss Wu.

06:57.230 --> 06:58.230
Hello, I'm Wu Jiang.

06:58.230 --> 06:59.730
Call me Zhong Wen.

06:59.730 --> 07:01.230
How do you feel here?

07:02.230 --> 07:03.230
Like a prison.

07:04.230 --> 07:06.730
Yes, once you're in there's
no getting out.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.730
I'm joking.
Miao is not here yet.

07:08.730 --> 07:11.230
I'll show you around, come.

07:23.730 --> 07:24.730
This was a factory,

07:24.730 --> 07:28.230
shut down for environmental reasons.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.760
Guess how long I took to redecorate it.

07:29.760 --> 07:30.760
Brother Wu.

07:30.760 --> 07:31.710
This is Brother Zhong.

07:32.760 --> 07:33.260
It look me two years.

07:33.260 --> 07:36.760
The other bars
demolished all these pipes.

07:36.760 --> 07:40.760
Such wonderfull stuff,
I keep them all.

07:44.260 --> 07:45.760
These piranhas are your idea?

07:47.760 --> 07:49.260
They're illegal.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.760
I don't know the law in local waters

07:51.760 --> 07:54.760
they'd be alien invaders.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.270
"Survival of the fittest"
is a rule of nature.

07:57.270 --> 07:58.800
You know Miao well?

07:58.800 --> 08:02.310
She says your business
keeps you too busy.

08:02.310 --> 08:04.680
What a story-teller.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.430
Freeze!

08:11.340 --> 08:14.270
That's my favorite room.

08:20.340 --> 08:21.840
Have a drink.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.340
Let's talk after the clients leave.

08:28.840 --> 08:33.340
<i>Welcome to
Wu Bar's 3rd Anniversary party!</i>

08:36.360 --> 08:38.360
Room 7 is ahead, turn right.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.360
You didn't tell me about
the celebration.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.360
Zhong, please wait for me inside

08:41.360 --> 08:44.860
My bar is full
I lose money by coming here.

08:44.860 --> 08:48.140
It's been a while.
You're prettier now.

08:48.140 --> 08:50.790
Don't touch! It will fall off.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.360
Which bottle would you like?

08:55.360 --> 08:57.360
I'm not drinking today.

08:59.530 --> 09:03.030
Please, my boss expects me to sell these

09:03.030 --> 09:04.030
Don't trouble him.

09:04.030 --> 09:07.030
You'll never change his mind.
Put it down here.

09:09.530 --> 09:10.530
Let's start with this.

09:10.530 --> 09:11.530
Please wait.

09:23.530 --> 09:26.030
I'm here. No rush.

09:26.030 --> 09:27.600
What's with the tattoo?

09:27.600 --> 09:31.600
I have many more
where you can't see them.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.100
You got smarter these 6 months.

09:34.100 --> 09:37.100
But your temper seems better.

09:37.100 --> 09:40.600
You told Wu I'm a businessman

09:40.600 --> 09:42.100
Should I have said you're a cop?

09:42.100 --> 09:45.970
It's a hard, shameful,
low-paying job

09:46.470 --> 09:47.970
Your drink, sir.

09:51.470 --> 09:52.970
How's you hospital internship?

09:52.970 --> 09:55.470
Don't worry about me.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.470
Did you get that scratch today?

09:59.970 --> 10:01.970
Did you disinfect it?
How did you get it?

10:01.970 --> 10:02.970
Don't ask.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.970
You dont want to tell me

10:05.970 --> 10:10.970
Someone reported a case this morning.

10:10.970 --> 10:13.970
A meat skewers cook stabbed someone,

10:13.970 --> 10:17.470
had nowhere to run
and threatened suicide.

10:17.470 --> 10:18.470
Are you jumping or not!

10:18.470 --> 10:19.470
Calm down.

10:19.470 --> 10:23.000
3 things.
1. Give me back my stove.

10:23.000 --> 10:23.990
Fine.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.110
2. I'm not paying a fine.
3...

10:26.110 --> 10:28.280
Hurry, it's freezing

10:28.330 --> 10:29.330
I'm not going to prison.

10:29.330 --> 10:30.330
What are you yelling about?

10:30.830 --> 10:31.830
I didn't yell.

10:32.830 --> 10:33.830
See this is minor.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.330
It's major a life was at stake.

10:36.530 --> 10:39.110
Have you jumped before?

10:39.110 --> 10:40.610
It's my first time.

10:40.610 --> 10:43.160
How's your aim?

10:43.160 --> 10:44.160
Good enough.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.330
Brother, let's talk...

10:45.330 --> 10:48.330
Stop. I'm not talking to you. Go!

10:48.330 --> 10:49.530
Who will you talk to?

10:50.640 --> 10:52.630
I'll talk to her. Bring her here.

10:52.630 --> 10:55.140
I'll talk to her. You, get out!

10:55.140 --> 10:58.640
<i>This went on all day.
We were all exhausted.</i>

10:59.070 --> 11:01.070
<i>I was worried he'd lose it.</i>

11:01.740 --> 11:02.870
So you started to talk to him.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.870
I didn't.

11:33.250 --> 11:34.440
Let go.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.250
Stay still.

11:35.760 --> 11:38.260
Help!

11:40.060 --> 11:44.060
He's not hurt, said he'd treat me
to lamb skewers.

11:44.060 --> 11:47.060
It's not worth it,

11:47.060 --> 11:49.060
to risk your life for strangers.

11:49.060 --> 11:51.560
What's so important
we need to talk here?

11:51.800 --> 11:53.300
You'll see.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.300
<i>Everyone's a victim of gossip,
these days.</i>

11:55.300 --> 11:57.800
<i>Don't admit anything. Goodbye.</i>

11:57.980 --> 11:59.480
Hello, Boss Niu.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.430
What a mess!
You can't film here.

12:03.430 --> 12:05.430
He looks familiar.

12:05.430 --> 12:07.930
He owns a property company,
a regular.

12:07.930 --> 12:09.930
He's rich, comes for the girls.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.480
<i>Boss Niu let me introduce,</i>

12:18.130 --> 12:20.130
<i>She looks so familiar.</i>

12:20.130 --> 12:22.140
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

12:24.200 --> 12:26.450
<i>- It's been a long time.
- He is my ex.</i>

12:26.450 --> 12:29.070
How did you meet Boss Wu?

12:29.070 --> 12:31.570
He came to the hospital
with an old injury.

12:31.860 --> 12:33.070
What do you think of him?

12:33.080 --> 12:34.860
I don't know, so I shouldn't say.

12:34.860 --> 12:36.070
Sorry. Brother Zhong.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.360
There are so many clients
I neglected you.

12:41.730 --> 12:44.770
Why did you change your look?

12:44.770 --> 12:48.310
To introduce, this is my boyfriend.

12:50.710 --> 12:53.210
Now you know
why we're meeting here.

13:06.760 --> 13:10.000
You two chat, I'll make my rounds.

13:21.270 --> 13:22.770
I don't like him.

13:26.770 --> 13:29.270
I'm telling you, not asking.

13:30.770 --> 13:31.770
It doesn't matter.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.270
He's almost my age.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.770
So what?

13:35.770 --> 13:38.770
Look at the company he keeps.

13:38.770 --> 13:40.770
He's stringing you along.

13:40.770 --> 13:41.770
Why should he?

13:41.770 --> 13:44.770
Why should I obey you?

13:46.770 --> 13:48.770
What is it about him?
What can he give you?

13:50.270 --> 13:50.770
I feel safe.

13:53.770 --> 13:56.770
I'm a cop, and you feel safe with him?

13:56.770 --> 13:58.270
He has time for me, do you?

13:58.270 --> 14:00.770
He is my shoulder to cry on, are you?

14:00.770 --> 14:02.770
Some cop.

14:03.220 --> 14:04.720
<i>Let me see what the racket is about</i>

14:04.720 --> 14:07.040
<i>- Stop it.
- Get out.</i>

14:07.040 --> 14:10.040
<i>Invitation see, I have one.</i>

14:18.020 --> 14:19.020
<i>Get out.</i>

14:21.520 --> 14:23.520
I know you've
been angry with me.

14:26.020 --> 14:28.020
I feel that I'm an orphan.

14:28.020 --> 14:31.520
Tommorow is your mom's
death anniversary, don't say that.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.020
Don't you talk about her.

14:35.020 --> 14:37.520
When she was here,

14:37.520 --> 14:40.020
you were never home.

14:41.020 --> 14:42.020
I was sick,

14:42.020 --> 14:45.020
she carried me to hospital
by herself,

14:46.020 --> 14:47.520
<i>I finally got you.</i>

14:48.020 --> 14:48.520
<i>Give me back my money.</i>

14:48.520 --> 14:51.020
You started to care only
after she left.

14:52.520 --> 14:53.520
I don't need you.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.020
<i>Come out here.</i>

14:58.020 --> 15:00.020
Excuse me.

15:03.520 --> 15:04.520
<i>What are you doing?</i>

15:04.860 --> 15:06.530
<i>How dare you make trouble here?</i>

15:06.530 --> 15:08.380
<i>It's only right to pay what is owed</i>

15:08.400 --> 15:11.360
<i>Let the scumbag pay me
and I'll go now.</i>

15:11.360 --> 15:13.390
<i>Shut up and get out!</i>

15:13.390 --> 15:15.350
<i>I want the pay owed to me
and my crew.</i>

15:15.350 --> 15:16.530
<i>You have a death-wish.</i>

15:16.530 --> 15:19.860
<i>I do, today.</i>

15:20.360 --> 15:21.360
<i>You won't get away now.</i>

15:21.360 --> 15:24.860
<i>Take it easy,
I'll pay you tomorrow.</i>

15:24.860 --> 15:26.860
<i>No, not tomorrow.</i>

15:26.860 --> 15:30.360
<i>Take some cash,
I'll get my men to handle it.</i>

15:30.360 --> 15:32.860
<i>I said, today.</i>

15:34.860 --> 15:35.860
<i>This won't work.</i>

15:37.860 --> 15:38.360
I'll talk to him.

15:39.360 --> 15:39.860
Who are you?

15:39.860 --> 15:41.360
I'm just having a drink.

15:41.860 --> 15:43.860
Please put out the fire first.

15:45.860 --> 15:47.360
I thought it's a major incident.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.360
It is, to me...

15:52.360 --> 15:52.860
Turn it off!

15:53.860 --> 15:54.860
How many years
have you been working?

15:54.860 --> 15:56.860
I've been a laborer for 10 years.

15:56.860 --> 15:58.360
Do you know there is a song?

15:58.360 --> 16:01.360
It was written for me.

16:03.860 --> 16:06.400
Turn it off!

16:07.900 --> 16:11.400
Let's talk openly here.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.400
Get the scumbag
into the open for once.

16:14.900 --> 16:15.900
Don't go.

16:16.900 --> 16:17.900
What are you doing?

16:17.900 --> 16:20.400
One last time will pay today?

16:20.400 --> 16:21.900
You've seen it all

16:21.900 --> 16:23.900
I can't pay you today.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.690
<i>You're lying again, scumbag.</i>

16:29.190 --> 16:31.190
I can't pay you today.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.690
Scumbag.

16:39.190 --> 16:40.690
Great move!

16:41.690 --> 16:43.690
My front tooth.

16:43.690 --> 16:45.690
This bomb is too amateurish.

16:47.690 --> 16:49.190
I've called the police.

16:49.690 --> 16:51.690
- Did you film that?
- I forgot.

16:52.690 --> 16:55.190
Get the waiters to help.
Call an ambulance.

16:58.690 --> 17:00.690
Stop! Out of the way!

17:05.510 --> 17:08.310
You're fine?

17:09.810 --> 17:10.810
Where are you going?

17:10.810 --> 17:12.310
To find Wu Jiang.

17:12.310 --> 17:14.310
Come, sit.

17:19.310 --> 17:20.810
Captain Zhong.

17:20.810 --> 17:22.810
I'll interview you after Boss Niu.

17:22.810 --> 17:24.310
The show is about to start.

17:24.310 --> 17:27.310
I must go, my clients are waiting.

17:27.310 --> 17:29.810
You think everyone here is weird, right?

17:30.810 --> 17:34.310
Drunks often make trouble here.

17:34.310 --> 17:36.310
All sorts of people show up here.

17:36.310 --> 17:37.310
Welcome.

17:37.310 --> 17:39.310
Two words, traffic jam.

17:39.310 --> 17:41.310
You worry too much.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.310
I hope that's the case.

17:42.310 --> 17:44.310
You're suspicious of everyone.

17:44.310 --> 17:48.810
<i>Tonight show begins now!</i>

18:34.060 --> 18:35.560
<i>Dad.</i>

18:38.040 --> 18:40.540
<i>Who are you?</i>

18:43.540 --> 18:47.540
<i>Get into the cage!
Don't think of getting out.</i>

18:52.040 --> 18:56.040
<i>There are so many of us,
let's attack them.</i>

18:57.300 --> 19:00.800
<i>Have you heard it?
Men go to help!</i>

19:13.800 --> 19:15.300
<i>Inside!</i>

20:39.380 --> 20:42.380
How long had I been out? Wu?

20:47.380 --> 20:51.380
Hours. You must have been exhausted

20:51.380 --> 20:52.380
Why did you do this?

20:52.380 --> 20:55.380
Ask why the police took so long, instead.

20:55.380 --> 20:58.880
No one called them.

20:58.880 --> 21:02.380
Everyone thought,
I don't want to be involved.

21:02.380 --> 21:04.880
Do you know what you're doing?

21:06.380 --> 21:11.550
Kidnapping. A felony.
At least 10 years jail.

21:13.050 --> 21:14.050
Where is my daughter?

21:14.050 --> 21:18.550
Miao? Waiting in the hall.
She's a good girl.

21:18.550 --> 21:20.050
Don't talk about her.

21:20.050 --> 21:24.050
She never said her dad's a cop.

21:24.050 --> 21:27.550
That makes you a bad dad,
and a bad cop.

21:27.550 --> 21:30.050
Am I your real target?

21:31.050 --> 21:34.550
Sir, the police are at the door.

21:36.050 --> 21:38.550
Ignore them. Wait downstairs.

21:41.050 --> 21:43.550
So you called the police.

21:45.050 --> 21:48.050
Sorry, I used your phone.

21:48.050 --> 21:50.550
I answered a call
from your lieutenant

21:50.550 --> 21:54.050
I described the situation.
He'll be here soon.

21:54.550 --> 21:58.550
You were military.
Over 20 accomplished years,

21:58.550 --> 22:02.040
in SWAT,
local regional and criminal police.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.540
Penalized once,
which you applied for yourself.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.040
You've done your homework.

22:06.040 --> 22:09.040
Too bad you couldn't
handle your family.

22:09.040 --> 22:12.540
After all these years,
your pay is so low.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.040
It took year's pay to buy a tiny home,
is it worth it?

22:15.040 --> 22:19.540
You don't get it.
Some things are priceless.

22:22.530 --> 22:25.530
Lieutenant is still on his way.

22:25.530 --> 22:28.530
No hurry.
We'll talk when he arrives.

22:34.530 --> 22:36.030
Tell me your demands now.

22:36.030 --> 22:37.530
Don't tell me what to do.

22:37.530 --> 22:40.030
Hostages are hurt,
the police won't be patient

22:40.030 --> 22:41.530
I'm patient enough.

22:41.530 --> 22:43.530
Say what you need to say.

22:44.530 --> 22:47.530
Fine, you're my target.

22:48.030 --> 22:50.030
Guess why?

22:53.530 --> 22:56.030
I've made many enemies.

23:02.130 --> 23:08.130
<i>Last year,
car thieves sold their loot nearby.</i>

23:11.130 --> 23:14.630
<i>We're short-staffed today.
So let's stick to the plan.</i>

23:15.130 --> 23:16.630
<i>There's 1 outside, 5 inside.</i>

23:16.630 --> 23:19.130
<i>The white-haired one is the leader.</i>

23:20.210 --> 23:21.710
Do you know White Hair?

23:21.710 --> 23:25.710
Yue.
Everyone here knows him.

23:27.210 --> 23:29.710
<i>Freeze! Police!</i>

23:30.210 --> 23:32.210
<i>Stop! Watch them.</i>

23:34.040 --> 23:37.040
<i>Yue is known to be vicious.</i>

23:37.040 --> 23:40.540
<i>You'll suffer if you try
to capture him by yourself.</i>

24:00.040 --> 24:03.040
Please let me go.

24:03.470 --> 24:06.470
I'll capture you myself.

24:48.030 --> 24:52.030
Just you wait.
Your time will come.

24:52.530 --> 24:55.030
I'll wait for you.

24:56.030 --> 24:58.530
You did this for him, right?

25:00.530 --> 25:02.030
I've heard of those guys.

25:02.030 --> 25:04.530
They're ranked too low.

25:05.530 --> 25:09.530
Most people use threats
to boost egos.

25:09.530 --> 25:11.530
I agree.

25:15.530 --> 25:19.530
Lieutenant, you're here.

25:19.530 --> 25:23.030
I'm chatting with Capt. Zhong.
He's fine.

25:23.740 --> 25:29.240
I want $80-90 million
in non-sequential bills.

25:30.740 --> 25:35.240
Don't threaten me,
don't talk about difficulty

25:35.940 --> 25:39.940
Wu, I don't know what you want.

25:40.440 --> 25:42.440
Make a reasonable demand.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.440
Lieutenant has a bad temper.

25:44.440 --> 25:47.940
Don't raise your hopes.
If we can do it, we will.

25:47.940 --> 25:50.440
Take it easy on him.

25:50.440 --> 25:52.940
You don't want money.

25:54.440 --> 25:57.440
Fine, I'll be frank.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.440
I want to see someone.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.940
It's easy for you to find people.

26:02.940 --> 26:06.440
But my friend lives far away.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.980
I haven't seen him in a while.

26:09.440 --> 26:12.940
<i>You like to ask why, you'll see.</i>

26:29.490 --> 26:34.120
<i>Not your call?
Why are you wasting my time?</i>

26:46.620 --> 26:50.620
Calm down, let's talk it out.

26:50.620 --> 26:52.620
Talk it out?

27:01.120 --> 27:04.120
You're bluffing me?
Don't bother.

27:07.120 --> 27:11.120
I forgot, you had been shot.

27:16.830 --> 27:20.830
I'm curious, what's it like?

27:23.330 --> 27:26.330
<i>It's like taking a vicious
hit with a stick.</i>

27:26.330 --> 27:29.830
<i>I couldn't find my shoulder,</i>

27:30.830 --> 27:33.330
or feel this side.

27:33.330 --> 27:37.330
Then, a pain that sears
through your heart.

27:37.330 --> 27:40.330
I've felt that searing pain.

27:40.330 --> 27:42.830
What happened to your leg?

27:43.830 --> 27:45.830
That was long ago.

27:53.210 --> 27:55.910
<i>The dark green pickup ahead.</i>

27:55.910 --> 27:56.910
<i>Pull over.</i>

27:56.910 --> 28:00.210
<i>Two suspects are in the truck.
The leader is a cripple.</i>

28:00.210 --> 28:01.710
<i>Should be the one in the back seat.</i>

28:02.890 --> 28:05.390
Have you ever kidnapped anyone?

28:12.500 --> 28:15.000
<i>The hostage is in there.
Don't shoot.</i>

28:16.000 --> 28:17.500
<i>Captain Zhong, we're going.</i>

28:17.500 --> 28:20.500
<i>Stay safe.</i>

28:36.740 --> 28:38.740
- Take care of them.
- Don't worry.

28:38.740 --> 28:40.030
I'll chase them.

28:40.240 --> 28:43.730
Call dispatch. We need backup.

28:54.860 --> 28:56.360
That's a better attitude

28:57.360 --> 29:02.080
Are you really bad at small talk,
or just acting?

29:03.580 --> 29:07.920
Fine. My only demand
is to see that person.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.460
Not "we'll try".
It's a "must".

29:10.460 --> 29:13.460
Confirm in 5 minutes.

29:16.130 --> 29:18.630
We're in no hurry. Let's chat.

29:26.130 --> 29:27.630
How are they?

29:27.630 --> 29:29.990
<i>Chao is fine. Hai broke his arm.</i>

29:33.490 --> 29:37.490
<i>The backup cars
will catch up soon.</i>

29:58.430 --> 30:01.930
Don't be afraid. I'm a policeman.

30:02.430 --> 30:05.930
Be brave.
Mr Policeman will come soon.

30:38.780 --> 30:40.780
Where's the other guy?

30:46.170 --> 30:50.170
Too bad we couldn't
save the driver.

30:50.170 --> 30:52.410
The main perpetrator
is still on the loose.

30:54.680 --> 30:58.680
Not a bad story,
but you guessed wrong.

30:58.680 --> 31:01.850
I despise people who kidnap children.

31:07.380 --> 31:08.880
This trip should
take no more than 3 hours.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.880
Traffic is smooth at this hour.

31:12.380 --> 31:16.380
The hostage?
Emotionally stable, pragmatic.

31:16.880 --> 31:19.300
Sure. I'll be on lookout.

31:21.880 --> 31:26.410
<i>Taozi, come up,
keep your eyes on him.</i>

31:31.410 --> 31:35.410
<i>Calm down.
Play some relaxing music.</i>

31:50.910 --> 31:53.910
Let me have a taste.

31:55.300 --> 31:57.800
Why? For courage?

31:58.800 --> 32:03.280
Take it easy, this stuff is strong.

32:57.330 --> 32:59.830
<i>What's going on?</i>

32:59.830 --> 33:02.330
<i>What's wrong, Niu?</i>

33:02.330 --> 33:04.830
<i>Heart attack.</i>

33:04.830 --> 33:06.540
<i>Is there a doctor here?</i>

33:08.010 --> 33:09.010
<i>Do you know how?</i>

33:09.010 --> 33:10.010
<i>Hospital.</i>

33:10.010 --> 33:12.010
<i>I'll go with you to the hospital.</i>

33:15.010 --> 33:20.010
<i>We must get to a hospital.
He can't die.</i>

33:20.500 --> 33:22.760
<i>Shut up.</i>

33:27.760 --> 33:30.260
<i>I'm a doctor.
I must go with him to the hospital!</i>

33:30.260 --> 33:31.760
<i>Out of the way!</i>

33:38.830 --> 33:42.830
<i>I'm fine.
It comes and goes.</i>

33:43.520 --> 33:45.520
<i>What a phoney!</i>

34:56.350 --> 34:57.350
<i>Where are they?</i>

34:58.300 --> 35:01.300
<i>Honestly, I'm anxious to see him.</i>

35:01.800 --> 35:05.800
<i>I warn you, if my friend isn't here</i>

35:05.800 --> 35:08.800
<i>All the cops
you bring will be useless.</i>

35:10.300 --> 35:13.300
Procedures are not my concern.

35:14.300 --> 35:17.800
What, you want to come in?
No need.

35:17.800 --> 35:18.800
I am a man of my word.

35:18.800 --> 35:19.800
<i>Wu Jiang.</i>

35:19.800 --> 35:21.800
When my guy arrives,
the hostages will be fine.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.800
<i>Wu jiang, come here.</i>

35:23.800 --> 35:25.800
Except Captain Zhong.

35:26.730 --> 35:28.230
<i>Wu Jiang.</i>

35:46.080 --> 35:48.580
<i>Listen! You won't get out but...</i>

35:48.580 --> 35:50.080
<i>you may make other requests.</i>

35:50.080 --> 35:52.580
<i>- Open up.
- What do you want?</i>

35:52.580 --> 35:54.580
<i>I need the restroom.</i>

35:59.070 --> 36:01.070
<i>Anything else?</i>

36:01.570 --> 36:03.070
<i>Boss Wu, may I interview you?</i>

36:03.070 --> 36:04.570
<i>Sure.</i>

36:09.570 --> 36:15.570
Get out!

36:38.450 --> 36:39.950
Dad, you're here!

36:39.950 --> 36:43.340
- Are you okay?
- Sorry. Dad forgive me.

36:43.340 --> 36:45.840
I dressedup like that to upset you.

36:45.840 --> 36:49.840
I didn't show I cared.
You're much prettier now.

36:51.790 --> 36:53.790
Put this away for me.

36:54.290 --> 36:56.790
Be careful, Dad.

36:56.790 --> 36:58.290
Where can I get a phone?

36:58.290 --> 37:02.290
They took all our phones.

37:02.290 --> 37:04.790
They're on the table in the hall.

37:04.790 --> 37:05.790
But...

37:07.290 --> 37:09.290
Hurry up!

37:20.520 --> 37:22.520
<i>I'm Zhu Nan,
host of the Life Channel.</i>

37:22.520 --> 37:24.520
<i>I risked my life for this exclusive.</i>

37:24.520 --> 37:26.020
<i>at a kidnapping.</i>

37:26.020 --> 37:28.020
<i>Here is the mastermind behind this case.</i>

37:28.020 --> 37:29.690
<i>Can I say that?</i>

37:29.690 --> 37:32.190
<i>You must have a great story.</i>

37:32.190 --> 37:34.190
<i>Boss Wu, Say hello.</i>

37:34.190 --> 37:38.190
<i>Hands off, I want a drink.
So what?</i>

37:40.690 --> 37:41.190
<i>Let's continue.</i>

37:41.190 --> 37:43.690
<i>Do you feel that.</i>

37:43.690 --> 37:47.190
<i>I'm insane for doing this?</i>

37:47.190 --> 37:50.690
<i>No, why are you
committing this crime?</i>

37:50.690 --> 37:57.190
<i>I just did what no one else dares.</i>

37:59.190 --> 38:02.190
<i>Let me go.</i>

38:03.690 --> 38:07.190
<i>I'm not done with the interview
Look...</i>

38:12.170 --> 38:14.170
<i>Are you done?</i>

38:16.910 --> 38:19.910
<i>You were nice to me to
get my dad here.</i>

38:20.410 --> 38:22.410
<i>If you must say that.</i>

38:22.410 --> 38:23.910
<i>You're using me.</i>

38:24.410 --> 38:27.910
<i>I'm not a good guy,</i>

38:27.910 --> 38:31.340
<i>your dad's not a good cop.</i>

38:31.340 --> 38:35.840
<i>Neither of us can make you feel safe.</i>

38:51.840 --> 38:54.840
This is Zhong Wen,
I stole a cell phone.

38:54.840 --> 38:55.840
<i>Are you safe now?</i>

38:55.840 --> 38:56.840
I'm fine, I'm hiding.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.340
<i>What going on?</i>

38:58.340 --> 39:00.840
There are over a dozen hostages.

39:00.840 --> 39:03.340
There were four suspects.
I got rid of one.

39:03.340 --> 39:04.840
The boss, Wu, is the leader.

39:04.840 --> 39:06.340
He has a knockoff 64.

39:06.340 --> 39:08.040
What are his demands?

39:08.040 --> 39:10.040
<i>He wants to see a prison detainee.</i>

39:10.040 --> 39:11.040
What's the name?

39:11.040 --> 39:13.540
<i>Wei Xiaofu.</i>

39:13.540 --> 39:19.040
<i>Chief has agreed
and is making arrangements.</i>

39:19.040 --> 39:23.040
<i>We've made a plan
with snipers and SWAT</i>

39:23.040 --> 39:25.540
<i>Are conditions suited
for a SWAT assault?</i>

39:25.540 --> 39:29.540
The bar is two storeys,
the hostages are in a cage,

39:29.540 --> 39:32.540
watched by the 3 suspects.

39:32.540 --> 39:35.040
If we attack now...

40:05.160 --> 40:08.160
It will be too dangerous
for the hostages.

40:08.160 --> 40:12.160
They may have other weapons.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.160
<i>Understood.</i>

40:13.160 --> 40:16.000
<i>We may attack at any time.</i>

40:16.000 --> 40:19.160
<i>Boss, that guy escaped.</i>

40:19.160 --> 40:20.160
<i>I have to go.</i>

40:20.160 --> 40:23.160
<i>Find him! Useless fool.</i>

40:56.210 --> 40:57.710
He's here.

41:02.550 --> 41:04.550
Is that all you've got?

41:04.550 --> 41:07.550
<i>I bet you still can't handle him.</i>

42:18.430 --> 42:20.930
<i>Brother Zhong, you're amazing.</i>

42:20.930 --> 42:24.930
<i>But aren't you worried about
your daughter?</i>

42:26.330 --> 42:30.830
<i>Miao said,
you used to be her hero.</i>

42:30.830 --> 42:33.830
<i>How did you become a desserter?</i>

42:34.330 --> 42:35.830
<i>Let's talk.</i>

42:35.830 --> 42:38.830
<i>In your words,
let's talk openly.</i>

42:38.830 --> 42:40.330
<i>Dad, don't worry about me.</i>

42:40.330 --> 42:44.830
<i>I wanted her in my
"law of the jungle" experiment.</i>

42:44.830 --> 42:45.830
<i>Don't come out, Dad.</i>

42:45.830 --> 42:48.830
<i>Sure, you must think
in your dark corner,</i>

42:48.830 --> 42:52.150
<i>but fingertips...</i>

42:53.150 --> 42:55.330
<i>...don't grow back.</i>

42:55.330 --> 42:56.830
Stop!

43:02.070 --> 43:04.570
Dad, don't come.

43:11.190 --> 43:13.190
Dad, don't come.

43:14.690 --> 43:17.690
Let her go. Target me.

43:22.190 --> 43:26.690
Now you're like a good father,
but it's too late.

43:26.690 --> 43:28.190
Stop.

43:40.630 --> 43:42.630
I'm fine.

43:51.840 --> 43:55.340
Give him room.
So, you are here on a case.

43:55.340 --> 43:58.340
Where were you?
Were we in any danger?

43:58.340 --> 44:01.840
Lady! Stop saying stupid things.

44:01.840 --> 44:02.840
What did I say?

44:02.840 --> 44:04.340
You don't stop talking!
So annoying!

44:04.340 --> 44:08.300
With this scoop,
she'll be promoted tomorrow.

44:08.300 --> 44:10.800
None of your business.

44:12.830 --> 44:14.300
I'm fine.

44:14.300 --> 44:16.800
Let me go.
Do you think I can escape?

44:16.800 --> 44:19.800
I'm sure you will. You'll be fine.

44:21.300 --> 44:25.300
From my experience,
he'll release us soon.

44:25.300 --> 44:27.800
In all kidnappings...

44:27.800 --> 44:31.300
They'd be killing the hostages now.

44:31.300 --> 44:32.800
It's usually about money.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.800
I know Wu well. He's rich.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.800
It's more than that.

44:36.800 --> 44:38.300
Is there a back door here?

44:38.300 --> 44:39.300
There's just this door.

44:39.300 --> 44:42.800
Boss designed the bar.
He sealed the back door.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.800
What does your father do?

44:45.800 --> 44:47.300
He's a policeman.

44:47.300 --> 44:51.300
Such hatred, beating him so badly.
Must be over a girl.

44:51.300 --> 44:53.300
Don't worry. We don't know him.

44:53.300 --> 44:55.800
I know you.

44:57.300 --> 44:58.800
The drug store.

45:00.300 --> 45:02.300
The thief, he stole from me.

45:02.300 --> 45:03.300
That's right.

45:03.300 --> 45:05.300
I didn't recognize you
without your uniform.

45:05.300 --> 45:06.300
She was there that day, too.

45:06.300 --> 45:08.800
That's Lan, now a manager
at the nightclub.

45:08.800 --> 45:11.300
And the famous Boss Niu.

45:11.300 --> 45:13.800
We were all there.

45:14.170 --> 45:15.670
Something happened inside.

45:15.670 --> 45:18.170
Captain Zhong is in there.
What happened?

45:18.170 --> 45:20.170
We're together again.
That's destiny.

45:20.170 --> 45:22.170
Cut the nonsense.

45:22.170 --> 45:24.670
Comrade Policeman,
what's your issue with Wu?

45:24.670 --> 45:27.170
Talk it out with him,
why involve us?

45:27.170 --> 45:29.670
Destiny, my foot.

45:30.670 --> 45:34.670
Chief Zhang, a high official.

45:34.670 --> 45:38.670
I'm so honored, they're all fine.

45:39.170 --> 45:40.670
You want to see them, right?

45:42.670 --> 45:46.170
Look. They're lively and well-fed.

45:46.170 --> 45:49.670
<i>I am Police Chief Zhang Guomin.
Don't worry.</i>

45:49.670 --> 45:51.670
<i>I will do my best to help you all.</i>

45:51.670 --> 45:54.670
Boss Wu, go ahead, we'll wait.

45:55.170 --> 45:58.670
Film this area and the people.

45:58.670 --> 46:00.670
My friend is still not here.
You are unreliable.

46:00.670 --> 46:03.170
<i>Give us more time.
Several reasons...</i>

46:03.170 --> 46:06.170
I don't care. You have 5 minutes.

46:06.260 --> 46:08.760
<i>Give me face, 5 more minutes.</i>

46:08.760 --> 46:12.760
If he is not here in 10 minutes,
I'll turn violent

46:12.760 --> 46:15.760
Please come, Boss Wu.

46:20.260 --> 46:21.260
I want to talk to you.

46:21.260 --> 46:22.760
Go ahead.

46:22.770 --> 46:24.270
Alone.

46:26.270 --> 46:27.770
Our usual place.

46:31.120 --> 46:35.120
Zhong, what more is there to say?

46:35.620 --> 46:37.620
You just want us.

46:37.620 --> 46:40.120
Why involve innocents?

46:40.120 --> 46:41.620
I need more chips.

46:41.620 --> 46:45.120
And how do you know
they're innocent?

46:45.620 --> 46:47.620
What do want to say?

46:47.620 --> 46:49.620
You created an elaborate plot.

46:49.620 --> 46:50.620
Yes.

46:50.620 --> 46:52.120
But you can't win with your way.

46:52.120 --> 46:53.620
We'll see.

46:53.630 --> 46:55.610
You need a middle-man.

46:55.620 --> 46:57.620
I can help.

46:57.620 --> 46:59.120
A cop helping a criminal.
What a joke.

46:59.120 --> 47:01.620
What do you want
to know from that case?

47:01.620 --> 47:02.120
I don't want to discuss that now.

47:02.120 --> 47:03.620
Then we'll wait for Wei Xiaofu.

47:03.620 --> 47:07.120
You ask lots of questions. My turn.

47:07.120 --> 47:10.120
You cops don't often
see this situation, right?

47:13.620 --> 47:15.120
We see all kinds.

47:15.120 --> 47:17.120
How many cases
have you been on?

47:17.120 --> 47:19.120
Many, over 100 a year.

47:19.120 --> 47:21.620
How many cops die in a year?

47:22.620 --> 47:26.120
About 400 die in the line
of duty in China.

47:26.120 --> 47:29.620
And how many hostages?

47:31.120 --> 47:32.120
Accidents happen.

47:32.120 --> 47:36.120
Will there be an accident today?

47:41.620 --> 47:44.120
I don't want casualties today.

47:44.120 --> 47:45.120
Including me?

47:45.120 --> 47:48.120
Yes. Every life is precious.

47:48.120 --> 47:50.620
I stopped believing that long ago.

47:50.620 --> 47:52.620
Although you've done
your homework.

47:52.620 --> 47:56.120
Zhong, you sneaked
into my secret chamber.

47:57.120 --> 47:59.120
So you know some of my secrets.

47:59.120 --> 48:02.620
You can see
this is beyond negotiation.

48:02.620 --> 48:05.120
So we have nothing to talk about.

48:07.620 --> 48:09.620
I see you're a boxer.

48:10.620 --> 48:16.120
I have some time,
let me tell you a story.

48:16.120 --> 48:18.620
You asked what happened
to my leg.

48:20.120 --> 48:23.120
<i>As a boy,
I went overseas with my father.</i>

48:23.620 --> 48:29.620
<i>He killed himself due to gambling debts.
I had to repay them.</i>

48:30.120 --> 48:33.120
<i>The only skill I had there</i>

48:33.120 --> 48:35.620
<i>was fighting.</i>

48:42.140 --> 48:44.320
<i>I had always fought,</i>

48:44.320 --> 48:48.320
<i>on others behalf.</i>

48:48.320 --> 48:51.320
<i>Fighting is about
who is more vicious.</i>

48:51.320 --> 48:53.820
<i>I never had a worthy opponent.</i>

49:11.750 --> 49:14.250
<i>You risk your life for money,</i>

49:14.250 --> 49:18.750
<i>but life is so worthless and fleeting.</i>

49:19.250 --> 49:22.250
<i>I swore to stop once
I repaid the debts.</i>

49:22.250 --> 49:26.750
<i>So during that time
I was like a crazy man.</i>

49:37.090 --> 49:39.090
<i>I finally repaid all the debts.</i>

49:39.090 --> 49:40.590
<i>but I didn't want
to do anything else.</i>

49:40.590 --> 49:46.090
<i>It was all about money, life and death.</i>

49:46.590 --> 49:48.590
<i>So, I continued.</i>

49:49.990 --> 49:52.990
You may be killed
by your opponent at any time.

49:52.990 --> 49:56.490
My nickname was Spider,
I never lost.

49:56.490 --> 49:59.490
But a spider is an insignificant bug.

49:59.490 --> 50:00.990
All illegal boxers are the same.

50:00.990 --> 50:04.360
You knew your men from boxing

50:04.360 --> 50:07.360
<i>The foreigners were the best
in their countries.</i>

50:07.360 --> 50:11.360
<i>The shorter one, Pichon,
is a regular champion.</i>

50:16.780 --> 50:19.780
<i>Everyone wanted us to fight,</i>

50:19.780 --> 50:21.780
<i>I know it is inevitable.</i>

50:24.280 --> 50:28.280
Before the fight,
I felt the bets were too big.

50:28.280 --> 50:32.280
The better fighter you are,
the more you're worth

50:32.280 --> 50:35.280
and the closer to death you are.

50:35.780 --> 50:39.280
What happened at that fight?

50:39.780 --> 50:42.780
<i>In the beginning we were even.</i>

50:42.780 --> 50:45.280
<i>Then he got the upper hand.</i>

50:46.280 --> 50:48.280
<i>The next round, he'll let you win.</i>

50:48.280 --> 50:51.610
<i>The two bosses
had arranged everything.</i>

50:55.020 --> 50:58.020
<i>I found out just
before the final round.</i>

50:58.020 --> 51:00.520
<i>It was a fight to the death.</i>

51:00.520 --> 51:03.020
<i>Next round, kill him.</i>

51:03.020 --> 51:07.020
<i>Boss didn't know
my heart was soft that day.</i>

51:07.020 --> 51:11.020
<i>I'd decided to return to China
after the fight,</i>

51:11.020 --> 51:14.520
<i>and bring some fighters
to help me.</i>

51:16.630 --> 51:22.130
<i>Poor Pichon,
only knew he was to lose.</i>

51:22.630 --> 51:24.630
<i>I told him he had been fixed to die.</i>

51:32.630 --> 51:36.130
<i>Disobeying the boss meant death.</i>

51:36.130 --> 51:40.630
<i>So several of us escaped
and hid for a time.</i>

51:40.630 --> 51:43.130
<i>We're lucky to the here, alive.</i>

51:43.130 --> 51:45.230
Why did you suddenly go soft?

51:45.230 --> 51:48.230
As you say, you don't get it.

51:48.730 --> 51:50.230
You've lived quite a life.

51:50.230 --> 51:53.730
But one can't treat
another's life lightly.

51:53.730 --> 51:55.630
Everyone has the right to live.

51:55.630 --> 51:59.370
To live well

52:10.190 --> 52:12.190
You know why I'm still alive?

52:12.690 --> 52:15.190
You came back
to China 5 years ago,

52:15.190 --> 52:16.690
just for drug store robbery.

52:16.690 --> 52:17.690
For the truth.

52:17.690 --> 52:20.690
The world is full of lies.

52:20.690 --> 52:23.690
Is this the only way
to find the truth?

52:25.690 --> 52:29.190
I should say, it's my way.

52:32.690 --> 52:36.190
Don't sit.

52:44.190 --> 52:47.190
Don't sit.

53:05.980 --> 53:10.980
Amazing!
You almost succeeded.

53:10.980 --> 53:15.480
This bullet-proof glass
is worth every penny.

53:15.980 --> 53:18.980
It's a police rescue effort,
you'd do the same.

53:18.980 --> 53:23.480
Your plan was good,
snipers and SWAT together,

53:23.480 --> 53:26.980
but I'm no amateur thief.

53:36.420 --> 53:37.920
Why didn't you let me sit?

53:38.420 --> 53:39.920
I wanted to save you.

53:39.920 --> 53:43.050
You want to help me
and save me.

53:43.550 --> 53:45.190
He's on screen.

53:45.190 --> 53:49.440
<i>- There were gunshots.
- Chief Zhang, I'm still alive.</i>

53:49.440 --> 53:51.340
Your Captain Zhong?
He also lives.

53:51.340 --> 53:54.840
Cut the nonsense.
Let me see Wei Xiaofu.

53:54.840 --> 53:57.340
<i>Why did you get me here
so late at night?</i>

53:57.340 --> 53:59.340
Get him in here to see me.

53:59.340 --> 54:02.340
<i>You're kidding!
I don't want to go in.</i>

54:02.340 --> 54:06.340
<i>It's against the rules
to bring a prisoner here.</i>

54:06.340 --> 54:08.840
<i>Please know we must
guarantee his safety.</i>

54:08.840 --> 54:10.840
You're tricking me.

54:13.760 --> 54:16.260
You must see Wei Xiaofu, right?

54:16.760 --> 54:18.260
Let me break it down for you.

54:18.260 --> 54:21.760
You're armed, took hostages
and are at a stalemate.

54:21.760 --> 54:23.260
I can kill some hostages.

54:23.260 --> 54:26.760
And I'll make sure
you'll never see Wei.

54:26.760 --> 54:30.260
And, the police will find
another way to attack.

54:30.260 --> 54:31.260
What are you saying?

54:31.260 --> 54:34.760
Only I can help you
to see him.

54:34.760 --> 54:37.760
He trusts me,
I can bring him in.

54:37.760 --> 54:41.740
I'll talk to him,
you free the hostages.

54:41.740 --> 54:43.740
Think about it.

54:48.240 --> 54:51.240
Life is like a cocktail.

54:51.240 --> 54:53.740
What does the next sip taste like?

54:53.740 --> 54:57.240
I've filmed everything
you told me to.

54:57.240 --> 54:58.740
Trust my skills.

55:08.070 --> 55:09.570
And if you don't come back?

55:09.570 --> 55:11.570
Trust me, I will.

55:11.570 --> 55:13.570
But you must guarantee Wei's safety.

55:13.570 --> 55:16.570
You dare to trust my guarantee?

55:16.570 --> 55:18.570
Trust is mutual.

55:19.070 --> 55:22.570
Take two people.
Your daughter stays.

55:23.070 --> 55:24.570
I said, all the hostages.

55:24.570 --> 55:28.070
Impossible, I must keep some.

55:29.070 --> 55:32.570
I know which ones.
Let the rest go.

55:32.680 --> 55:34.680
No.

55:34.680 --> 55:36.680
No deal.

55:37.150 --> 55:39.180
- Three.
- No deal.

55:39.180 --> 55:41.150
You can only bring 3 hostages.

55:44.440 --> 55:46.440
Put down your gun.

55:54.360 --> 55:56.360
You two have hot tempers.

55:56.360 --> 55:59.860
Here. You two fight.

56:03.860 --> 56:07.360
You win, I promise
you can bring people out.

56:07.360 --> 56:11.360
You lose, go alone.

56:12.360 --> 56:13.860
Dad, you're hurt.

56:13.860 --> 56:15.360
You can't defeat him.
Don't fight.

56:15.360 --> 56:18.360
You're not young anymore.

56:18.360 --> 56:21.360
It's embarrassing to lose.
Never mind.

56:21.360 --> 56:24.360
Why? Fight!
You're a cop!

56:24.360 --> 56:25.860
Good prevails over evil.

56:25.860 --> 56:26.860
Take us out.

56:26.860 --> 56:28.530
Fine.

56:29.030 --> 56:31.030
Agreed.

56:38.030 --> 56:39.530
Comrade Police, it's all on you!
Go, go!

56:39.530 --> 56:41.030
Be careful, Dad.

56:45.530 --> 56:50.030
In a few seconds,
you won't be able to get up.

57:04.140 --> 57:07.140
This fight is too hard.

57:07.140 --> 57:11.480
We cannot benefit from his loss.
Pray for him.

57:14.030 --> 57:17.530
Captain Zhong,
no shame in giving up.

57:36.950 --> 57:39.950
Stop playing the hero, Dad.

57:39.950 --> 57:43.450
Zhong, give up
if you can't handle it.

58:19.390 --> 58:23.890
Dad, stop!
You can't beat them.

58:27.250 --> 58:31.990
Get up. Cop!

58:31.990 --> 58:33.990
Go. Mr Policeman.

58:38.440 --> 58:39.940
Beat him.

58:59.150 --> 59:01.150
How suspenseful.

59:05.760 --> 59:08.260
He is good.

59:20.650 --> 59:22.650
Stop, Dad.

01:00:17.550 --> 01:00:21.550
Stay down or you'll die.

01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:25.530
Stop fighting.

01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:29.030
We don't want
to go out any more.

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:34.530
Cop, we are moved,
you tried your best.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:38.030
Mr Policeman,
we don't want to go any more.

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:40.030
Stop, don't get up.

01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:46.530
Please stop fighting,
I beg you.

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:06.220
Don't let go! Hang on tight!

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:13.340
He can't last! Harder!

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.340
Careful, Cop.

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:19.770
Cop, let go! Watch out.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.000
Let go. You won.

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.000
You won.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.780
Give me your scarf.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.280
Don't lock up again!
Aren't we all going?

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:19.390
- Here's an idea.
- I'll take my daughter out first.

01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:21.890
When Wei Xiaofu comes in,
she may go.

01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:22.890
I'm not going anywhere.

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:26.890
I'm staying here
with my dad till the end.

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:29.390
Don't regret it

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:33.390
As agreed,
I'll give you the man you want.

01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:34.890
Bring three people with you first!

01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:36.890
Why change now? This is too much.

01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:39.390
It's leverage in case
you don't come back.

01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:43.890
I'll release them
just before Wei comes in.

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:46.890
That's not a change,
choose the hostages.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:54.140
Wu, I really can't go on.
I'll forfeit the money.

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:56.640
My health is poor.
May I be one of them?

01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:01.140
Wu, if you think I'm useful
to you I'll stay.

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.640
I'll go out to film, okay?

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:08.130
Have you decided?

01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:11.130
The two injured hostages,

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:13.630
and him.

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:18.130
You.

01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:21.130
Me? Just me?

01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:24.630
No. I'm staying with my girlfriend.

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:26.130
Only you dared make a move.

01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:29.630
We need more men like you.

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:32.130
I'll make an exeption.
Go together.

01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:34.730
Hurry.

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:40.770
You're a casualty, you lost a tooth.

01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:43.770
Just me?

01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:46.270
We're inseparable.

01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:49.770
I owe him money.
I need to pay him outside.

01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:52.770
You'd have enough to pay
if you'd drink less.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.160
Captain Zhong, you must return.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.660
Zhong.

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:04.660
You have 10 minutes,
I'm very punctual.

01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:19.450
Hostages are coming!
We need a stretcher.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.160
There are four more.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.760
This is a suspect, cuff him.

01:04:32.650 --> 01:04:35.150
You saved my life.

01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:36.650
Hurray for the Policeman!

01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:40.150
There are more people back here.

01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:48.210
- Are you badly hurt?
- I'm okay. It's minor.

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:49.710
Chief Zhang.

01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:51.210
Check out these suspects.

01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:52.710
3 suspects and 3 gunns.

01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:53.710
Where are they located?

01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:55.710
In the main hall, with 16 hostages.

01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:57.530
Physical conditions of the hostages?

01:04:57.530 --> 01:05:01.030
All right. But they can't last
much longer mentally.

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:03.030
Lieutenant.

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:06.530
I felt you took action
too soon just now.

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:11.030
Captain Zhong,
the suspect wants to talk to you.

01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:14.420
I'll tell you everything I know.

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:15.420
Speak.

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:17.420
I did this for money.

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:19.920
I never imagined
he'd make such a big deal.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.920
Please don't go in.
You'll never get back out.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:27.920
They told me they dont expect
to get out alive.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.290
That's all I know.

01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:32.860
Thank you, sir.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.020
These are from
the building's management.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.520
We have 8 more minutes.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:46.020
It differs from the blueprint,
the windows are sealed.

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:48.020
This door,

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:50.020
is made with 25cm-thick steel panels.

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.520
The walls are 50cm thick.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.520
There was a back door
but it's been sealed.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.520
He is from building management.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.520
How could you allow all
these changes?

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.520
It's their private property.
Out of our jurisdiction.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.520
Fine, I'll call you if I need you.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:03.560
He really made himself a fortress.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:04.640
Over here?

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:08.140
You can go in from the roof here
and be hidden.

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.640
7 more minutes.

01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:14.150
This is a home-made bomb
with a timer.

01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:18.650
The wiring is complex,
with multiple detonators.

01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:19.650
He means to blow up everyone,
including himself.

01:06:19.650 --> 01:06:21.650
There are so many hostages.

01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:26.150
The best way to save them
is for me to bring Wei in.

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:28.150
Trading 3 people for 12.

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.650
Has he agreed to go in?

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:42.030
I was on the phone
with my mother.

01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:45.530
She wants me to behave,
to try for early release.

01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:49.030
Please help us.

01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:51.530
It's too risky.

01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:53.030
Your safety is a concern.

01:06:53.030 --> 01:06:56.030
It may be dangerous
but we'll try our best

01:06:56.030 --> 01:07:00.530
Help us, we'll apply
to reduce your sentence.

01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:05.630
I still feel unsafe. Forget it.

01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:08.630
We cannot force you
to take this great risk

01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:12.130
Thank's for taking care
of my mom all these years.

01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:14.130
I promised years ago that I would.

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:17.130
Everyone on our team donated
to your family.

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:18.630
I'm touched.

01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:21.630
Here is the information
on the suspects.

01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:22.630
Bin, a Thai.

01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:24.130
Pichon, a Filipino.

01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:28.130
Wu Jian, returned 5 years ago,
as a Thai.

01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:30.630
The victim Mei's parents
were divorced.

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:31.630
The mother died,

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:36.130
a brother went overseas
with the father.

01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:38.130
I think Wu Jiang is Mei's brother.

01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:41.630
He's not asking
for Wei Xiaofu's release.

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:43.630
3 of the hostages
were witnesses back then.

01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:46.630
I think he wants to know
what happened.

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:49.630
Cops, criminals, witnesses, all here.

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:51.630
It's been 5 years.

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:54.130
You have 4 more minutes.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.560
Let's talk method.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:00.060
We'll dress as Zhong and Wei,
SWAT stands by.

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.060
First, cut open the roof by laser.

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:05.560
The door opens,
we attack from above and below.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.560
It's hard to attack
through the crack in the door.

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.560
This way, we get their attention.

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:13.560
Roof-cutting time varies.
We'll endanger the hostages.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.060
Hostages safety comes first.

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.060
Let me negotiate again.

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:17.560
You can't.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.560
lives are at stake.
talk is useless.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.060
This is too major.

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:24.560
It calls for a hard-core assault.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.560
Assaults are most risky now.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.060
And you're not taking a risk
by going back in?

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:29.560
Keeping my promise will build trust.

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.560
There is still a chance to talk.

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.060
You've been talking for 6 hours.

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:34.560
Some negotiations last 6 months,
you know?

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:35.060
No.

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.560
We got the injured
hostages out with talk.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.560
Lieutenant was looking out for you.

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.060
Trading 2 for 12, good deal.

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:46.120
See? As Lieutenant,
I should go in, not you.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.620
It's my case,
the same one as 5 years ago.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:51.120
I'm most suited to go in.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.649
Besides, my daughter is inside.

01:09:04.649 --> 01:09:09.149
Shouldn't he stay away
for that reason?

01:09:09.370 --> 01:09:11.370
Stop arguing

01:09:11.370 --> 01:09:13.870
Zhong should go back in.

01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:15.870
But get a substitute for Wei.

01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:20.370
Wu will know at a glance.

01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:22.870
Chief Zhang, please come here.

01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:28.870
<i>Repeat what I say.
"3 more minutes."</i>

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:30.370
<i>- The thug says...
- What?</i>

01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:32.370
<i>Boss Wu says, "3 more minutes."</i>

01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:32.370
<i>"If he doestn't come, you will die."</i>

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:35.870
<i>"If he doesn't come,"</i>

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:38.580
<i>- "I will die."
- "No Joke."</i>

01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:42.870
<i>"No joke."
He's really not joking, help!</i>

01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:45.359
<i>Less than 3 minutes now.</i>

01:09:45.859 --> 01:09:48.859
Chief Zhang,
Wei Xiaofu has agreed to go in.

01:09:48.859 --> 01:09:49.859
Reason?

01:09:49.859 --> 01:09:51.359
1... to repay our favor,

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:53.359
2... he doesn't want to cause evil.

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:55.360
He's a real man.

01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:59.680
Make a small opening to save time.
Go!

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.180
Yes, sir! Run.

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:03.680
Bomb Squad, give Wei a suit.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.680
The Lieutenant is in charge.

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:08.180
It's on you.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:12.680
Guoqiang, this is your sniper operation.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.680
As you say,
your own safety is key.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.680
Sniper needs to set up.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.180
Buy time with talk.

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:22.680
On my orders.
It's already loaded.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.180
Dont be angry.

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.680
I didn't want you
to bear this alone.

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.680
If possible, let me talk a bit more.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:39.180
If I can control the scene,
don't let the sniper shoot.

01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:41.180
You win.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.000
You can still smile?

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.500
These clothes are safe and warm.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.500
But it weighs over 35 kgs.

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:12.000
Does this count as a merit?

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.500
So, I may get a reduced
sentence for this?

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:21.000
I can still care for my mom
in this lifetime.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.500
<i>- The roof cutting team is in place.
- Yes.</i>

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.500
Hurry.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:32.000
Say something, Captain Zhong.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Are you being brave
for your daughter?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
How is it your daughter is here?

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.500
If she wasn't here,
would you dare to go back in?

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.760
What's wrong with her?

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:42.000
When the hostages come out
we'll go in.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.020
Once we go in,
will we get out alive?

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:53.520
I promise to keep you alive
as long as I live.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.520
What if you die first?

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:00.520
Just Kidding.
I'm a nervous wreck.

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:04.520
Once inside,
stay next to me and don't move.

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.880
- May I speak?
- Speak the truth, not nonsense.

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.880
What did you stuff into
my clothes just now?

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.880
That's nonsense.

01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:25.070
Arms..

01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:38.640
You should get a job
at Airport Security.

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:41.740
Again, bullshit.

01:13:11.150 --> 01:13:13.150
Police.

01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:16.150
Police! Hurry, help!
What's going on?

01:13:16.150 --> 01:13:18.150
Talk, don't hit.

01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:19.650
We're in positions of power.

01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:22.160
- These sons of bitches.
- Where's my daughter?

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:23.660
Dad, I'm here.

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:25.660
I'm fine.

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:27.160
You take care.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:30.160
Help! Police!
I'm afraid of heights.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.160
Your outfit is awesome,
can you get us out?

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.660
What is all this?

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.660
What's tied around our necks?

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:39.480
Can you tell me what's going on?

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.370
It looks like a bomb.
Is it real?

01:13:42.370 --> 01:13:46.450
Five, four...

01:13:46.450 --> 01:13:48.050
Three...

01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:49.600
Two...

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.550
One...

01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:54.980
It's real.

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:07.760
We're missing one person.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.760
Maybe a hostage is still inside.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.260
Good job, Captain Zhong.

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:13.260
You really brought him in here.

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:16.760
I'm a man of my word.
I want to evacuate the hostages.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.260
Your crimes are not serious.

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:21.260
We can explain everything away.

01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:24.260
I can prove you stopped voluntarily.

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:27.260
You can't help me.
It's my time now.

01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:30.080
18 more minutes.

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:35.080
What is he wearing?
What a ridiculous getup.

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.080
- We must do our best to protect him.
- This is my turf. You can't protect him.

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.080
You had guaranteed his safety.

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.580
His temporary safety.

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:43.080
In this getup.
I don't recognize him.

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.080
Remove his helmet.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.550
Helmet off.

01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:51.050
Stay back.

01:14:57.670 --> 01:15:00.670
- Stay back!
- Don't play this game with me.

01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:02.690
They despise me.

01:15:02.690 --> 01:15:05.660
I'm not afraid.
He thinks I'll cause evil.

01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:09.190
- Stay back!
- I don't want to wear this

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:13.660
It's stuffy, I'm dizzy.

01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:16.160
I'm not afraid.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.160
Wei Xiaofu.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.660
Isn't that, who it is?
How come it's him?

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.880
Put on your helmet.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.880
Relax. Captain Zhong.
I'll be with you now.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.040
The police forced you
to come, right?

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.040
You're wrong, I came willingly.

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:31.040
You've gathered everyone.

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.540
The truth will be known.

01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:35.540
I've been waiting for this day.

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:48.160
<i>Big brother,
when will you be back?</i>

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:57.250
Everyone knows this girl, right?

01:15:57.750 --> 01:16:00.250
Now you know,

01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:02.250
she is my baby sister.

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:06.750
We were separated,
I found her 5 years ago.

01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:09.250
She's the meaning of my life.

01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:11.750
I came back,

01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:14.250
but didn't see her.

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:17.750
I finally found a way
to meet with you.

01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:21.400
I don't know what happened,
5 years ago.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.900
But you were all there.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:26.400
Let's talk.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:30.400
It's been so long.
What if I can't remember?

01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:33.400
The bomb is remote controlled.
It may help you think.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:36.400
Let me think, I should remember.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.400
Let's begin.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.400
When we're done
I can go back out, right?

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.400
Someone won't make it out today.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.900
Then what can I do
to make sure I will?

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.900
Don't mess with me,
but that's hard for you.

01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:49.400
Say your piece. Hurry.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.900
Who should speak first?

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.900
<i>Cutting the roof takes time.</i>

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:57.740
<i>The team is worried
about disturbing those below.</i>

01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:01.240
<i>You're right.
My first idea won't work.</i>

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:02.240
<i>Just play for time.</i>

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.240
Let me start.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.240
Wait, Zhong.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.240
Remove your communications devices,

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.740
so I won't have to.

01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:13.210
<i>We're trying other ways to break in</i>

01:17:13.210 --> 01:17:15.210
<i>We can start the assault
in 15 minutes.</i>

01:17:15.210 --> 01:17:18.210
<i>Till then,
you're in charge of the inside.</i>

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:29.720
Wei Xiaofu, you start.

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:37.480
It all started with me.

01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:41.480
<i>That night, almost at this time.</i>

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:45.480
<i>A few customers were
at the drug store, I went in.</i>

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:57.450
<i>I want to do something for my mom</i>

01:17:57.450 --> 01:17:59.450
<i>She's in poor health.</i>

01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:02.450
<i>But I can't afford tonics.</i>

01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:04.950
<i>My mistake was being too nosy.</i>

01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:06.950
<i>I'll give you 20 extra.</i>

01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:13.450
I wanted to ask
whose wallet that was.

01:18:13.450 --> 01:18:14.950
No way,

01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:16.450
who are you trying to kid?

01:18:16.450 --> 01:18:18.950
You were drunk,
what do you know?

01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:22.950
I was drinking,
but my mind was clear.

01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:30.950
<i>Hand it over.</i>

01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:33.450
<i>What is this?</i>

01:18:33.450 --> 01:18:34.870
<i>I just picked it up from the floor.</i>

01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:36.280
<i>- You stole it.
- I just picked it up.</i>

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.280
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.280
<i>You dare to steal my stuff?
Go to hell.</i>

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:40.280
<i>I really did pick it up.</i>

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:42.280
<i>Wait.</i>

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.780
<i>Don't move.</i>

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:44.780
And then?

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:47.780
Then...

01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:47.780
Quickly.
- I am

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.890
I am dearest on what happened next

01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:51.390
<i>Go to hell!</i>

01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:52.390
<i>I really picked it up.</i>

01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:53.890
<i>Wait.</i>

01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:56.370
<i>Don't move.</i>

01:18:57.370 --> 01:18:59.870
<i>This is mine.
Did you pick it up, too?</i>

01:18:59.870 --> 01:19:01.870
<i>Does he have any more?</i>

01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:03.870
<i>Two boxes.</i>

01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:06.870
I'm a man of principles.
I convince with reason.

01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:08.370
Were you being reasonable?

01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:09.870
I call it as i see it.

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:11.870
That's called hitting me
when I'm down.

01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:13.870
What?

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:17.180
I remember every word
you said that night.

01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:18.180
<i>This box costs tens of thousands.</i>

01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:20.180
<i>You have good taste.</i>

01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:22.180
<i>Shall we handle it ourselves,</i>

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:25.680
<i>or call the police?</i>

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.180
<i>Handle it or police.</i>

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.600
<i>You can't tell? He's poor.
Call the police.</i>

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:35.100
<i>Sure, I'll call them now.</i>

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:37.100
<i>Don't call the police.</i>

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.600
<i>I was afraid it would
become a big deal.</i>

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:42.100
<i>That's how it became a big deal.</i>

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:44.100
<i>Who dares to call the police?
Don't!</i>

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:46.080
<i>Stop, if you want to live.</i>

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.080
<i>What do you mean?
What do you want?</i>

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:50.080
<i>Give it to me.</i>

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.580
<i>Give it over. Now!</i>

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:54.080
<i>Hello, Police?</i>

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.580
Thinking back I really was confused.

01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:01.080
I should have run,
they wouldn't have stopped me.

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.580
But I...

01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:05.070
<i>Give me the phone.</i>

01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:07.070
<i>We're being robbed!</i>

01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:08.570
<i>The drug store by Gu Lou.</i>

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:10.570
<i>Give it to me! Let go!</i>

01:20:10.570 --> 01:20:15.570
When my sister was thrown
to the ground.

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:20.680
You just looked on.

01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:28.680
He was closest, he ran.
What could I have done?

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:31.680
<i>Of course I wanted to approach,
but they left.</i>

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.180
<i>I'm not experienced with one-on-one.</i>

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:37.680
I wasn't scared,
but he dragged me away.

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:38.680
And then?

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:41.680
I'll tell the story for you

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.180
<i>I was off-duty and passed by...</i>

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:53.680
<i>Comrade Police,
something's happening there.</i>

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.680
<i>Don't move. Stay away.</i>

01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:59.680
<i>He stole something.
She called the police.</i>

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:01.680
<i>The thief, he...</i>

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.680
<i>Step out.</i>

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:05.180
<i>Stop. Don't come over.</i>

01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:06.450
<i>Call dispatch, notify local police.</i>

01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:08.260
- I was thinking then...
- I'll tell it for you.

01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:10.180
The criminals may kill the hostages.

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:11.540
<i>Don't move! Back off!</i>

01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:13.200
<i>Captain Zhong has the power to...</i>

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.680
<i>- One more step and I'll kill her.
- ...easily and decisively kill you.</i>

01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:19.400
You're being ridiculous.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:22.090
If thats the case,
there wouldn't be a problem.

01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:23.850
All life is precious.

01:21:23.850 --> 01:21:25.410
Without understanding...

01:21:25.410 --> 01:21:27.140
Captain Zhong is used
to talking it out.

01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:28.640
There's no rush.
Let's talk it out.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.770
But Zhong was distracted.

01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:33.020
His wife was...

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:36.680
run over by a car...

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.180
and being treated in hospital.

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:42.180
The hospital and
his daughter kept calling him.

01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:44.680
<i>- I get it.
- Why are you on the phone?</i>

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:46.180
<i>- I'll be right there.
- Hang up!</i>

01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:48.180
Wei Xiaofu gets out of control.

01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:50.680
<i>Are you tricking me?
What do you want?</i>

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:52.680
<i>Do you think I'm bluffing?</i>

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:55.680
And the rest is history.

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:59.180
<i>Captain Zhong,
tell us what's going on inside.</i>

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.680
You tell great stories.

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:02.680
How can you be sure?

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:05.180
Were you there?
How do you know everything?

01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:07.180
Are you done speaking?

01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:09.150
It's my turn.

01:22:09.150 --> 01:22:13.150
Miao will tell you,
but she doesn't know much.

01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:16.150
That night, my wife
was running a high fever.

01:22:16.150 --> 01:22:18.650
I was working and
couldn't take her to the hospital.

01:22:18.650 --> 01:22:20.150
She forbidden her to go.

01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:23.150
She took a cab alone,
and the accident happened.

01:22:23.150 --> 01:22:25.150
<i>I ignored my phone,</i>

01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:26.650
<i>but felt something was wrong.</i>

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:28.650
I felt rushed that day.

01:22:28.650 --> 01:22:30.650
Captain Zhong
was so patient that day.

01:22:30.650 --> 01:22:32.650
<i>Take your time,
we'll talk everything out.</i>

01:22:32.650 --> 01:22:36.150
<i>When I called back I found out
what happened.</i>

01:22:36.150 --> 01:22:38.650
<i>By the time
I rushed to the hospital.</i>

01:22:38.650 --> 01:22:41.650
<i>It was too late.</i>

01:22:42.650 --> 01:22:45.650
<i>I wanted to explain
to my daughter, but..</i>

01:22:45.650 --> 01:22:48.650
<i>she would neither listen
to or forgive me.</i>

01:22:51.150 --> 01:22:53.650
I had tried
to convince him to stop.

01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:57.550
<i>I took the drugs for my mom.</i>

01:22:57.550 --> 01:23:01.550
<i>Let's clarify everything
and do what must be done.</i>

01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:03.050
<i>Let the girl go.</i>

01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:05.550
<i>It would be bad if she got hurt.</i>

01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:08.050
<i>We'll think of a way
to help your mother.</i>

01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:09.550
<i>Will that do?</i>

01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:12.050
<i>So can't you let me go?</i>

01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:13.050
<i>Please!</i>

01:23:13.050 --> 01:23:14.550
Wei was agitated.

01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:17.550
Your sister was quite calm.

01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:20.050
I didn't know what to do.
Suddenly...

01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:22.550
Accidents always happen suddenly.

01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:25.550
Fine. Let me continue.

01:23:25.670 --> 01:23:30.670
<i>It was chaos outside.
Your sister said, softly,</i>

01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:32.030
<i>"Kill me."</i>

01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:33.530
What did she say?

01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:37.000
She spoke very softly.
I thought I mis-heard.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.990
What did you say?

01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.990
You heard it, too?

01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:42.490
I heard her cry out, once.

01:23:42.490 --> 01:23:43.990
That was her second cry.

01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.990
<i>What did you say?</i>

01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:46.490
<i>"Kill me."</i>

01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:48.990
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:51.990
<i>It wasn't me, I didn't move.</i>

01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:54.590
<i>Ambulance.</i>

01:24:04.710 --> 01:24:08.710
<i>She injured her carotid artery
and bled to death.</i>

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:11.710
This is the truth you wanted.

01:24:12.210 --> 01:24:16.210
So my sister killed herself.

01:24:16.210 --> 01:24:19.710
Of course,
I used my knife as a bluff.

01:24:19.710 --> 01:24:23.210
I never guessed she would grab it,
it scared me.

01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:24.710
Why should I believe you?

01:24:24.710 --> 01:24:25.840
I believe him.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:27.340
You weren't even there.

01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:29.840
She was troubled.

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.840
See what drug she bought

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.840
What drug?

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:36.840
What drug did she buy?

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:41.340
Manager, I'm afraid you must tell us.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.340
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.840
<i>Testing for leaks.</i>

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:48.840
<i>You're paying for this.</i>

01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:52.080
<i>Sleeping pills.</i>

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.080
<i>Prescription?</i>

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.580
<i>100 pills.</i>

01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:57.270
<i>By law, it's sold
by prescription only.</i>

01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:59.770
I am a man of principle.

01:24:59.770 --> 01:25:01.770
And then?

01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:04.270
I'll take over from here.

01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:08.480
The law is dead. People are alive.

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.980
A warning,

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:11.980
to pull a bluff, just take a few.

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:12.980
Can I buy them or not?

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:15.300
Sure,...

01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:16.800
but it doesn't cost this much.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.800
I'll give you a few more pills, then

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:21.300
Coming, one moment, please.

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.800
- Are you done?
- Yes.

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:25.300
Continue.

01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:27.800
<i>What? They're all the same.</i>

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:29.800
<i>You broke up?</i>

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.800
<i>It's always that.</i>

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
<i>I've taken them before.
It's horrible.</i>

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.430
<i>I didn't die, had my stomach pumped,
vomitted like mad.</i>

01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:39.930
What else did you say?

01:25:39.930 --> 01:25:41.430
Nothing

01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:42.930
You're no angel.

01:25:42.930 --> 01:25:45.400
I remember what you said next.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.900
<i>What true love?</i>

01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:49.400
<i>I don't trust anyone any more.</i>

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.900
<i>There are so many men.</i>

01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:54.400
<i>We're not the same kind of people.</i>

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:57.940
What do you mean?
Playing innocent.

01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:00.440
You're so blind!

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.940
Just go and die.

01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:03.940
- When did I say all that?
- You said it.

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:07.380
Wu, I never did.
I tried to talk to her

01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:09.380
Your sister died because
of what she said.

01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:11.880
You sold her the drug knowing
she was depressed.

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:14.380
I can prove he sold her the drug
They're working together.

01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:16.380
Shut up!

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:18.540
Calm down.

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.540
They did find sleeping pills on her.

01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:23.540
Does buying
sleeping pills equal suicide?

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:26.540
Extreme agitation
may cause dire actions.

01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:28.040
I know why.

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.540
Watch what you say.

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:31.540
Half of female suicides
are for a man.

01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:33.540
The other half are for several men.

01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:36.040
- Boss Wu...
- I say so because I've done it.

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:39.380
I realize now it's not worth it,
but many don't.

01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:41.380
Listen to me.

01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:44.380
I completely understand
how you feel.

01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:48.380
It's hard to live alone
abroad for so many years.

01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:52.880
Your sister was your only family,
the light of your life.

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.900
Knowing she died,
you returned to investigate...

01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:00.400
or take it out on someone.
That's natural

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.900
Go on.
You  have 5 more minutes.

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:07.900
You planned this
to punish her killer, right?

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:10.900
Regardless of method,

01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:13.400
you have the wrong target.

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.900
You mean you are all innocent

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:17.900
What Lan said makes sense.

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.400
Explain yourself.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.400
There is something you must know.

01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:26.110
Your sister was pregnant
at the time.

01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:34.210
She sees you as a parent,

01:27:34.210 --> 01:27:36.210
she must have told you.

01:27:36.210 --> 01:27:37.210
Stop.

01:27:37.210 --> 01:27:40.710
When the M.E. discovered
her pregnancy, we investigated.

01:27:40.710 --> 01:27:42.710
She had no marriage record,

01:27:42.710 --> 01:27:45.210
and the father never came.

01:27:45.210 --> 01:27:48.210
See? Men are not worth it!

01:27:48.210 --> 01:27:50.710
Clearly no one
here is the person you seek.

01:27:50.710 --> 01:27:53.210
Even if you find him,
there might be a story there.

01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:55.850
- You're trying to confuse me.
- I want to clear your mind.

01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:57.850
Even so, you're out of time.

01:27:57.850 --> 01:28:00.350
Look, you've made
it like a trial today.

01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:02.350
- Each one of you is guilty.
- The law has already...

01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:06.350
You just watched as my sister died?
You, a cop.

01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:07.850
I admit I made mistakes.

01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:10.350
It was your knife.

01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:12.350
Does 10 years jail pay for her life?

01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:14.350
What do you want from me?

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:18.260
Niu, Lan, you stood
by while she died.

01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:22.120
- You're killers.
- What did I do?

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.540
No one minds
others business any more.

01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:27.040
At least let me know
why I have to die.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.540
I helped her.
I tried to talk her out of it.

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:32.040
She didn't trust anyone.
It's not my fault.

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:35.040
- Manager.
- Put on your helmet.

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.040
For a small profit,
you let my sister die.

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.540
I'm not the only one.

01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:41.540
And she didn't die from the drugs.

01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:47.330
No one shoots!

01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:49.330
Tell them to put down their guns.

01:28:49.330 --> 01:28:50.830
Don't force me to shoot.

01:28:51.330 --> 01:28:53.330
Stop, Wu.

01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:55.460
You can still live
if you surrender now.

01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:56.960
No shooting.

01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.460
Fine.
Stop shouting or I'll shoot you.

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:01.960
This is a great outfit.

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.460
Drop your guns.

01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:05.460
Careful behind you, Dad.

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.650
Life is like a cocktail.

01:29:10.150 --> 01:29:12.150
Drink it all to know...

01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:15.150
if it was bitter or sweet.

01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:18.650
You're hard to handle.

01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:23.150
Meet Kun,

01:29:23.150 --> 01:29:27.040
Bartender and bomb maker.
My leg.

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:30.540
What do you want?

01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:34.540
Don't worry. This is fake.

01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:37.040
The real ones come later.

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:38.040
None of you can hide from them.

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.040
Please! Spare us!

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:42.540
Why didn't you just kill me?

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.040
Glad you understand.

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.540
I'm saving you.

01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:50.040
But it's over.

01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:54.540
Not yet.

01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:59.540
You're my sister's boyfriend, right?

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.540
What kind of joke is this?

01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:05.540
I found half a picture
among her things.

01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:08.540
I remember your tattoo.

01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:10.540
You've changed it,

01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:13.540
but I still know it.

01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:15.540
Really?

01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:19.540
Really?

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:26.350
Since Zhong has said so,
I'll tell you.

01:30:26.850 --> 01:30:28.350
Yes.

01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:29.850
I am him.

01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:32.850
Interesting.
I thought you escaped long ago.

01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:36.350
Yet you work
and make bombs for me.

01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:39.350
Why are you pointing
your gun at me?

01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:41.850
I want to see
how you avenge Mei's death.

01:30:41.850 --> 01:30:45.850
Good for you.
We're really all here.

01:30:45.850 --> 01:30:48.850
I was a coward then.

01:30:48.850 --> 01:30:50.850
But now I know I'll be last to go,

01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:53.350
I fear nothing.

01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:55.850
Speak quickly.
You have 2 minutes to live.

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:59.970
Wu, you had a part
in her death, too.

01:30:59.970 --> 01:31:01.690
What?

01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:04.690
She told me...

01:31:04.690 --> 01:31:06.690
you didn't want her to be with me.

01:31:06.690 --> 01:31:10.190
But I genuinely fell in love
with her.

01:31:10.190 --> 01:31:12.690
She got pregnant and told you.

01:31:12.690 --> 01:31:15.690
But you said
you'd come to kill me.

01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:17.690
She was so hurt

01:31:17.690 --> 01:31:20.190
There was no hope for me,

01:31:20.190 --> 01:31:23.190
so I broke up with her.

01:31:24.190 --> 01:31:26.690
That night, we had a big fight.

01:31:26.690 --> 01:31:28.690
She stormed out, crying.

01:31:28.690 --> 01:31:30.190
I ran after her.

01:31:30.190 --> 01:31:33.690
<i>Even that final time
we looked at each other...</i>

01:31:33.690 --> 01:31:36.690
<i>we never knew
how fragile life would be...</i>

01:31:36.690 --> 01:31:40.190
<i>I lived for revenge.</i>

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:44.200
<i>Now I know
how much she hated me.</i>

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:48.200
What one didn't treasure,
one may not salvage.

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.700
Right, Wu?

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.800
Come, the gun is in your hands.

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:58.300
Wu.

01:31:59.410 --> 01:32:01.410
I wronged her the most.

01:32:02.910 --> 01:32:04.910
I most deserve to die.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.500
Get down!

01:33:50.230 --> 01:33:51.050
Dad!

01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:41.790
Miao!

01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:45.290
Dad, I'm here.

01:34:46.290 --> 01:34:48.290
Dad I'm here.

01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:49.790
You missed the first train.

01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:52.790
I could have gotten on,
but there's no point.

01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:53.790
You destroyed my plan.

01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:55.790
Your plan?
Why must you harm my daughter?

01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:58.290
Everyone's lives
are worthless except Mei's

01:34:58.290 --> 01:35:01.290
No one has the right
to take other's lives in anger.

01:35:01.290 --> 01:35:02.290
Stay away!

01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:04.880
My sister didn't deserve to die.

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:06.380
So you have to hurt more people?

01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:08.380
If she were alive,
would she want this?

01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:10.880
But she's dead.

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:11.880
She'll never return.

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:13.880
Then you must
treasure life even more!

01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:15.380
Dad.

01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:18.380
Let my daughter go.

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:21.880
This is the same scene
as 5 years ago.

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:25.880
Shoot. You get a merit.
I get to die.

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:27.380
Win-win.

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:29.880
Of course,
there may be accidents.

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:31.880
I beg you,
let my daughter go.

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:35.880
If I do, will it be over?

01:35:38.410 --> 01:35:41.910
You must pay for your actions.

01:35:44.650 --> 01:35:46.150
Throw the gun over.

01:35:46.150 --> 01:35:48.650
Don't obey.
Don't let him have the gun.

01:35:48.650 --> 01:35:51.150
Throw the gun over.

01:35:51.150 --> 01:35:52.150
Wu Jiang.

01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:04.870
You're right. Someone must pay.

01:36:08.970 --> 01:36:11.970
I will do anything for my sister.

01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:16.350
Sadly, now I know
I'll never escape.

01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:19.850
Zhong, we will have
this last game.

01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:24.850
There's 1 bullet left.
Shoot before the next train.

01:36:24.850 --> 01:36:28.850
Shoot me and I'll stab her neck.

01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:31.850
Shoot yourself and she lives.

01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:34.850
Dad, don't believe him.

01:36:36.210 --> 01:36:41.220
<i>Shoot me and I'll stab her neck.</i>

01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:44.220
<i>Shoot yourself and she lives.</i>

01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:47.720
Don't shoot, I'll kill her anyway.

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:50.720
Who lives? Who dies?
It's up to you.

01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:58.470
I was late then because
I was saving someone else.

01:36:58.470 --> 01:37:00.470
I was wrong to blame you.

01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:01.470
Unfortunately, I failed there, too.

01:37:01.470 --> 01:37:04.470
Zhong, the train is coming.

01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:08.470
I'll take responsibility
for your sister's death.

01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:11.970
My daughter
has nothing to do with this.

01:37:11.970 --> 01:37:14.470
Please don't hurt her,
no matter what.

01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:18.970
I want to see you
be that kind of father.

01:37:19.970 --> 01:37:21.470
I'll give you 10 seconds
before I shoot.

01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:22.970
No, Dad.

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:28.700
Ten... nine... eight...

01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:33.700
Chil, I've been a bad father.

01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:35.910
I had no time for you,

01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:37.910
and made you feel vulnerable.

01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:39.410
Sorry.

01:37:39.410 --> 01:37:40.910
...three...

01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:43.820
But... for you

01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:46.320
I will do anything.

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:52.660
...one.

01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:05.750
Sorry,
I removed the bullet just now.

01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:08.750
I would do anything for my sister.

01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:10.750
A small trick.

01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:21.750
Zhong, I admire you. Go.

01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:25.160
- Wait for me on the platform.
- Dad, I cannot go.

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:28.160
Go get someone!
This is an order! Now!

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:31.160
Run!

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:33.660
Is there anything else, Zhong?

01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:36.660
- I must arrest you.
- Say I vanished.

01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:39.660
I'll do anything for my sister.

01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:40.780
I'd die for her.

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:42.120
Wu Jiang!

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:44.160
- Get out of my way.
- It's not worth it!

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.160
I'll take the blame for my deeds!

01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:55.370
Ignored me, as if I were a bug.

01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:57.370
Don't worry about me.

01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:17.020
Give up. You can still live.

01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:32.930
Goodbye.

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:19.100
Hurry, get a doctor!

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.600
Hang in there.

01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:29.100
- You threw the switch?
- Yes, perfect timing, right?

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.520
Wait...

01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:33.740
Good one, brother.

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:35.740
That hurt.

01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:37.240
All hostages are safe,

01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:38.740
no penalty for you.

01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:40.240
How's Wei Xiaofu?

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:42.240
He's a tough kid.

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:45.240
Take care of your father.

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:50.450
- Dad, you're great.
- I'm very ordinary.

01:41:50.450 --> 01:41:53.950
Stop being humble, cop.

01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:59.080
Take it easy on me
from now on.

01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:05.300
Wu Jiang says,
you win this round.

01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:08.800
This is for you.
He says goodbye.
