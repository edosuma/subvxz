00:02.617 --> 00:05.078
I'm sorry. Do you know
where the library is?

00:05.125 --> 00:07.375
Hey, you guys go on ahead, okay?

00:07.414 --> 00:09.347
<i>- For those of you who don't know,</i>
- I'm Zoey.

00:09.383 --> 00:11.653
<i>- this is Cash Mooney.</i>
- I'm Cash.

00:11.692 --> 00:14.753
<i>Cal U student, my ex-boyfriend...</i>

00:17.627 --> 00:20.515
<i>...superstar basketball player...</i>

00:21.595 --> 00:24.096
<i>and the dude who was
responsible for creating</i>

00:24.131 --> 00:26.537
<i>one of the biggest uproars
in Cal U history.</i>

00:28.035 --> 00:29.534
<i>And I'm not talking about</i>

00:29.570 --> 00:32.104
<i>the time he posted about my virginity.</i>

00:33.908 --> 00:35.440
Cash, what the hell?!

00:35.475 --> 00:37.676
How could you put my business
out there like that?

00:37.712 --> 00:39.411
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

00:39.446 --> 00:41.279
<i>Wait, I should</i>

00:41.315 --> 00:42.748
<i>probably break this down.</i>

00:44.476 --> 00:45.883
<i>Like most college stories,</i>

00:45.919 --> 00:47.919
<i>it started with a party.</i>

01:09.242 --> 01:11.475
<i>But the night really became
interesting when Cash</i>

01:11.510 --> 01:14.812
<i>came through, and, of course,
he was celebrated like</i>

01:14.848 --> 01:18.216
<i>only a future first-round NBA
draft pick could be.</i>

01:19.418 --> 01:20.752
<i>So, he met a girl...</i>

01:22.789 --> 01:24.889
<i>...they shared some drinks..</i>

01:24.924 --> 01:27.828
<i>...and they shared a lot more drinks.</i>

01:38.103 --> 01:41.571
<i>And then they shared a night.</i>

01:41.606 --> 01:44.345
<i>The next morning, she shared
the story with her friend.</i>

01:44.370 --> 01:45.502
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

01:45.527 --> 01:47.477
It happened. Cash and I hooked up.

01:47.512 --> 01:48.745
Oh, no!

01:48.781 --> 01:50.346
Uh, uh, give me the deets.

01:50.382 --> 01:52.515
Was it legendary, epic?

01:52.550 --> 01:54.117
Uh, yeah.

01:54.153 --> 01:55.786
I... I think. Who cares?

01:55.821 --> 01:57.453
It was Cash Mooney.

01:57.489 --> 01:58.822
Cash Mooney.

01:58.857 --> 02:00.257
Yeah, I swear to God.

02:00.292 --> 02:01.691
She said they were faded.

02:01.726 --> 02:04.194
Bad luck for dude, though, and the team.

02:04.830 --> 02:07.697
Totally blacked out, like,
completely unconscious.

02:07.732 --> 02:09.699
- Dude's a monster.
- He's disgusting.

02:09.734 --> 02:11.867
Oh, my God. Did you
guys hear about Cash Mooney?

02:11.903 --> 02:15.371
- Yeah, that's crazy.
- Man, that's whack.

02:15.407 --> 02:17.640
<i>So, a bad game of telephone mixed with</i>

02:17.676 --> 02:19.609
<i>our current sociopolitical climate</i>

02:19.644 --> 02:22.211
<i>threw our university into an uproar.</i>

02:22.246 --> 02:26.716
<i>When, as a result, a new policy
was implemented campus-wide.</i>

02:35.059 --> 02:37.993
What the hell's

03:16.266 --> 03:17.899
Looks like your boy

03:17.934 --> 03:19.000
really messed up on this one.

03:19.035 --> 03:20.535
He didn't mess up.

03:20.571 --> 03:22.437
And he's not her boy.

03:22.473 --> 03:24.038
Look, did you even read the article?

03:24.074 --> 03:25.774
I mean, the girl who hooked up with Cash

03:25.809 --> 03:27.442
said it was a huge misunderstanding

03:27.478 --> 03:28.776
and that they're cool.

03:29.545 --> 03:31.913
Hey.

03:31.948 --> 03:33.114
Hey.

03:33.149 --> 03:35.016
I just wanted to check in.

03:35.051 --> 03:37.585
This is all so crazy.

03:37.620 --> 03:39.354
Yeah, I know.

03:39.389 --> 03:41.756
Look, I'm so sorry
if I misread the situation.

03:41.791 --> 03:43.124
You didn't.

03:43.159 --> 03:44.759
To be clear, I mean, we had some drinks,

03:44.794 --> 03:48.429
but that night was
completely consensual.

03:50.267 --> 03:52.233
So, how did this all blow up?

03:52.269 --> 03:54.135
I mean, I had a conversation
with my friend.

03:54.170 --> 03:56.137
He got things twisted,

03:56.172 --> 03:58.273
and then it all got out of control.

03:58.308 --> 03:59.941
This is such a nightmare.

03:59.976 --> 04:01.609
Yeah, it... it is.

04:01.644 --> 04:04.545
Again, I'm really sorry.

04:04.580 --> 04:06.047
Well, I'm glad they're cool,

04:06.082 --> 04:07.505
because the rest of
the school is screwed.

04:07.530 --> 04:08.599
I mean, this whole

04:08.624 --> 04:10.614
Enthusiastic Sober Consent thing
is some bull.

04:10.639 --> 04:13.497
What does Enthusiastic Sober
Consent even mean?

04:13.822 --> 04:19.259
<i>Mutual, voluntary consent,
communicated clearly before</i>

04:19.295 --> 04:22.429
<i>and during any sexual activity.</i>

04:23.465 --> 04:25.565
It basically means
that when you're hooking up,

04:25.600 --> 04:27.667
you have to ask for permission
every stage of the game.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.303
Like, "Oh, can I kiss you?

04:29.338 --> 04:31.238
Can I rub you? Can I touch your boobs?"

04:31.273 --> 04:32.839
It's too much.

04:32.874 --> 04:34.674
Okay, first off, it's "May I?"

04:34.709 --> 04:37.010
Nothing's a bigger
bonerkiller than bad grammar.

04:37.046 --> 04:38.778
Except maybe correcting bad grammar.

04:38.814 --> 04:40.347
Can I finish?

04:40.382 --> 04:41.815
I don't know.

04:41.850 --> 04:43.183
<i>May</i> you finish?

04:43.218 --> 04:45.018
Okay, look, nobody's gonna be finishing

04:45.054 --> 04:46.686
with this massively unsexy policy.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.455
Isn't it just about safety, though?

04:48.490 --> 04:50.157
I mean, first day of freshman year,

04:50.192 --> 04:51.857
we had the seminar
about protecting ourselves

04:51.892 --> 04:53.659
against sexual assault, and even, like,

04:53.694 --> 04:54.961
think about our group dynamics.

04:54.996 --> 04:56.295
We have the buddy system.

04:56.331 --> 04:58.197
We never leave our drinks unattended.

04:58.232 --> 05:00.199
Why is that? I think this policy's just

05:00.234 --> 05:01.667
an extension of that,

05:01.702 --> 05:03.336
and I don't see what the problem is.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.871
Really? You don't get
how unsexy it is to stop

05:05.906 --> 05:08.174
and double check between
hand and mouth stuff?

05:08.209 --> 05:10.176
I get how unsexy it is

05:10.211 --> 05:12.144
hearing you talk about
hand and mouth stuff.

05:12.180 --> 05:14.880
Can we forget about how not-sexy
something is for a second?

05:14.915 --> 05:17.183
I mean, women are
and continue to be assaulted

05:17.218 --> 05:19.818
on campuses everywhere,
and just because it wasn't

05:19.854 --> 05:22.221
the case this one time
between Cash and the girl

05:22.256 --> 05:24.991
doesn't mean it's not
happening constantly.

05:25.026 --> 05:28.760
Absolutely. And I for one think
consent can be pretty sexy.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.867
I don't know what you just said,
but whatever it was,

05:35.902 --> 05:38.136
it's an enthusiastic "hell yes."

05:38.171 --> 05:40.872
So, then that means
you're in on the policy.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.907
- Hell no.
- I, uh, I think

05:42.942 --> 05:44.742
I'm with Vivek on this one.
I mean, it's gonna decimate

05:44.777 --> 05:46.011
our entire college experience.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.013
We came here to meet new people,

05:48.048 --> 05:49.814
get trashed with them,
and then have sex with them.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.149
- Yes.
- Bingo.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.018
Well, the university would just prefer

05:53.053 --> 05:55.186
if you do those things one at a time.

05:55.222 --> 05:58.423
It's supposed to help us have
positive sexual experiences.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.226
What is more positive
than drunk and sloppy sex?

06:01.261 --> 06:03.094
Church? Get on board.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.696
- Amen.
- Whatever. I don't need...

06:05.732 --> 06:07.765
I don't need the school telling
me how to behave when I drink.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.668
- Well, some people do.
- Yeah, like creepy-ass Cash.

06:10.703 --> 06:13.505
No, I'm talking about Ana.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.340
You just gonna let her
call you out like that?

06:16.375 --> 06:17.942
I do get sloppy.

06:17.977 --> 06:19.510
Why you keep playing
games with me, Burt?

06:19.546 --> 06:20.845
Where are we going?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.112
We're just gonna get some fresh air.

06:22.148 --> 06:25.049
No! I don't need fresh air.

06:26.719 --> 06:27.834
Chloe?

06:27.867 --> 06:29.394
Ms. Torres, I'd really just like to get

06:29.422 --> 06:31.022
my chicken strips, please.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.357
Whatever. I feel safer with
this policy in place.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.026
Yeah, me too. I feel like it's gonna

06:35.061 --> 06:36.360
be a really good thing.

06:36.395 --> 06:37.895
Well, I mean, yeah, of course you do,

06:37.931 --> 06:40.264
because it's designed
to protect you, not me.

06:40.299 --> 06:42.466
Okay, Aaron. You know that this policy

06:42.501 --> 06:44.301
is not meant to keep the man down.

06:44.336 --> 06:46.370
It's meant to protect all students.

06:46.405 --> 06:49.040
How? I don't see dudes
out here getting assaulted.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.407
False.

06:50.443 --> 06:52.409
I know some dudes that
have been assaulted.

06:53.713 --> 06:54.579
By women?

06:54.614 --> 06:55.879
Hmm?

06:55.914 --> 06:57.080
Nah, that's ridiculous.

06:57.115 --> 06:58.982
Uh, not really.

06:59.017 --> 07:00.784
It's actually a lot more
common than you think.

07:00.819 --> 07:02.118
Yeah, like poor Wade.

07:02.153 --> 07:03.753
Who is Wade?

07:03.789 --> 07:05.122
Just one of my boys
who happened to be at a party

07:05.147 --> 07:06.904
one night and found himself
in a compromising

07:06.929 --> 07:08.969
sexual situation with two women.

07:08.994 --> 07:11.260
What? Dude, that's not an assault.

07:11.303 --> 07:12.669
That's called the dream
I had last night.

07:12.698 --> 07:14.043
- It's wonderful.
- No, man. I'm serious.

07:14.068 --> 07:15.131
It was at the end of the night.

07:15.166 --> 07:16.666
He was at a party, these two chicks

07:16.702 --> 07:19.102
are pressuring him to get down,
and he wasn't into it.

07:19.137 --> 07:20.971
But he didn't want to say no
and get called a punk,

07:21.006 --> 07:23.473
so he let them do mouth stuff to him.

07:23.508 --> 07:26.776
So I'm supposed
to run a charity 5k for your boy

07:26.812 --> 07:28.578
that got domed up by two chicks?

07:28.614 --> 07:31.013
Okay, let's be clear.
Vivek is out of his mind.

07:31.048 --> 07:33.348
We know that. But, devil's advocate,

07:33.383 --> 07:34.984
how is his homie's scenario
any different

07:35.019 --> 07:36.485
if the gender roles were reversed?

07:36.520 --> 07:38.821
Because women have
a huge physical disadvantage

07:38.856 --> 07:40.188
compared to guys.

07:40.224 --> 07:42.457
Yeah, and I highly doubt
that punk-ass Wade

07:42.493 --> 07:44.693
felt physically threatened by two girls.

07:44.729 --> 07:46.161
And this kind of talk is exactly why

07:46.196 --> 07:47.863
Wade felt he had to get domed up.

07:47.898 --> 07:49.965
No, this kind of talk is why
dude felt like he couldn't

07:50.001 --> 07:52.167
say anything in the first place,
and the fact that we're legit

07:52.202 --> 07:55.104
sitting here joking about it
is super problematic.

07:55.139 --> 07:57.940
Okay, fair, but how is
this policy even enforceable?

07:57.975 --> 07:59.274
I mean, who here's actually gonna

07:59.309 --> 08:00.976
stop drinking and hooking up?

08:01.012 --> 08:03.779
Well, I could see...

08:03.814 --> 08:07.314
Oh, wow, okay,
so the two biggest supporters

08:07.350 --> 08:09.851
of this thing aren't
even gonna follow it.

08:09.886 --> 08:11.218
You see, this is what I'm saying.

08:11.254 --> 08:12.720
Who is this even for?

08:12.756 --> 08:14.622
I'll tell you who... the university.

08:14.658 --> 08:16.624
If something goes down,
they want to be able

08:16.660 --> 08:19.060
to wash their hands of it
and say, "We had a rule."

08:19.095 --> 08:20.695
- Mm-hmm.
- Absolutely, as usual,

08:20.730 --> 08:23.364
the administration is
just covering its own ass.

08:23.399 --> 08:25.499
But honestly, who cares,
because if this policy

08:25.535 --> 08:27.468
stops one incident from happening,

08:27.503 --> 08:29.037
I'd say it's worth it.

08:29.072 --> 08:31.472
Well, dude doesn't have
to worry about that anymore.

08:31.507 --> 08:32.707
What are you talking about?

08:32.741 --> 08:34.174
Check the Shade Room.

08:34.210 --> 08:35.909
Cash is leaving school.

08:37.981 --> 08:39.847
What?

08:42.418 --> 08:44.918
Boom. How do you like
your policy now, Freshman?

08:44.953 --> 08:46.153
Huh?

08:46.188 --> 08:47.487
Mm, mm, mm.

08:47.522 --> 08:49.289
Poor little Cash.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.493
<i>While my crew and I were trying to get</i>

08:53.518 --> 08:55.056
<i>our heads around Cal U's new</i>

08:55.081 --> 08:57.548
<i>Enthusiastic Sober Consent policy,</i>

08:57.573 --> 09:00.900
<i>a new problematic twist
in my ex-boyfriend Cash's</i>

09:00.925 --> 09:03.055
<i>story added to the confusion.</i>

09:03.080 --> 09:06.428
Okay, so, it says that
Cash is leaving Cal U

09:06.463 --> 09:07.549
to play ball in Europe.

09:07.574 --> 09:09.931
He probably left because he wanted to.

09:09.966 --> 09:13.068
Or 'cause he looks mad Sus.

09:13.103 --> 09:14.602
Like, I don't know,
he can only get girls

09:14.637 --> 09:17.672
when they're, uh...
when they're super faded.

09:17.707 --> 09:20.178
Hold on, now, okay.
Some of us need a little alcohol

09:20.203 --> 09:21.879
to help with our game. All right?

09:21.904 --> 09:23.478
If Cal U won't let me drink
while I hit on a girl,

09:23.513 --> 09:24.638
I might as well transfer.

09:24.663 --> 09:27.063
I mean, you saw me
at the party that night.

09:27.099 --> 09:29.133
Hey, it's flu season.

09:29.168 --> 09:31.235
Have you ladies gotten your shots?

09:42.780 --> 09:45.214
Somebody call wine-one-one?

09:45.816 --> 09:47.517
I could very clearly argue

09:47.552 --> 09:50.219
that alcohol hurts
your game tremendously.

09:50.255 --> 09:52.455
Like you never use booze
to help with the ladies.

09:52.490 --> 09:55.258
Unlike you, Vivek,
I don't need help, right?

09:55.293 --> 09:57.360
My game has just naturally evolved.

09:57.395 --> 10:00.496
I'm sorry I'm not evolved
enough to use the "ThotFax."

10:02.167 --> 10:05.268
I'm sorry. A "ThotFax"?

10:05.303 --> 10:07.036
You know, um, well...

10:07.071 --> 10:08.871
...it's just like,
you know, you don't bring

10:08.906 --> 10:10.640
a car home unless you check the CarFax.

10:10.675 --> 10:13.024
You don't bring a girl home
unless you check the ThotFax.

10:18.348 --> 10:20.602
Odd that you didn't just
call it the "GirlFax."

10:20.626 --> 10:22.546
- Yeah.
- Look, before I even go to a party,

10:22.571 --> 10:23.652
I've already got
my homies giving me Intel

10:23.688 --> 10:25.120
about which girls are at the party,

10:25.156 --> 10:26.822
so that way, by the time
I'm at said party,

10:26.857 --> 10:28.657
I'm just Robocopping the room.

11:04.356 --> 11:06.190
Hmm, interesting.

11:06.215 --> 11:08.583
So Michelle Obama types are your thing.

11:08.608 --> 11:09.974
Not always.

11:09.999 --> 11:12.466
Now that is some
sexist bullshit right there.

11:12.501 --> 11:14.102
Girl, you know we do it, too.

11:14.137 --> 11:15.636
It's how you figure out
who the Dirty D. Derek

11:15.671 --> 11:18.439
- of the world are.
- Mmm...

11:43.866 --> 11:45.966
Look, the point is,
I don't need alcohol, okay?

11:46.001 --> 11:49.570
I rely on my ThotFax,
my charisma, and, you know,

11:49.605 --> 11:51.003
my turn-up moves on the dance floor.

11:51.038 --> 11:52.705
Mm! No, mnh-mnh-mnh.

11:52.741 --> 11:54.407
Pause, I have seen you
on the dance floor,

11:54.442 --> 11:56.242
and that turn up needs
to be turned, like,

11:56.269 --> 11:57.439
- all the way down.
- All the way.

11:57.464 --> 11:58.463
What?

12:09.424 --> 12:12.925
Like, legit, your moves blocked
the hall to the bathroom.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.395
Yeah, you know girls got UTIs

12:15.430 --> 12:17.363
'cause they didn't want to get,
like, kicked in the face.

12:17.399 --> 12:19.198
Those girls got UTIs.

12:19.233 --> 12:20.767
I got Y-E-S's.

12:20.802 --> 12:22.669
All right, but all
those "yes's" you're getting,

12:22.704 --> 12:24.703
how do you know that
they're enthusiastic?

12:24.738 --> 12:26.505
What? Why would a girl dance with me

12:26.540 --> 12:28.039
if she didn't want to dance with me?

12:28.074 --> 12:30.709
Uh, we do a lot of things
we don't want to do because

12:30.744 --> 12:33.278
we're "supposed to be nice and polite."

12:33.314 --> 12:35.079
- Mm-hmm.
- And, news flash,

12:35.115 --> 12:37.248
it happens on the dance floor
and in the bedroom.

12:37.284 --> 12:40.185
No women are in my bed
to be polite. Trust.

12:40.220 --> 12:42.721
No one is in your bed period, trust.

12:44.425 --> 12:48.794
No, but I know lots
of girls who get with a guy,

12:48.829 --> 12:51.530
they start making out,
and then, you know,

12:51.565 --> 12:53.998
things start to happen,
and then, you know,

12:54.034 --> 12:55.600
it gets to a point
where stopping would just

12:55.636 --> 13:00.038
make it awkward or messy,
and you just go through with it.

13:00.073 --> 13:01.839
Wait. So, wait, wait, wait.

13:01.874 --> 13:04.342
So you're telling me
that you're having sex

13:04.377 --> 13:06.444
just to be polite?

13:06.479 --> 13:07.778
I haven't.

13:07.814 --> 13:09.714
What I'm saying is it does happen.

13:09.749 --> 13:13.451
Like... Like, uh, when you
order food at a restaurant,

13:13.486 --> 13:15.386
and you change your mind.

13:15.421 --> 13:17.888
No one ever wants to be
that person to send it back.

13:17.923 --> 13:19.323
- Seriously?
- What?

13:19.359 --> 13:20.758
Please, I've sent back plenty of food.

13:20.793 --> 13:21.959
And dicks.

13:21.994 --> 13:24.228
Guys, this literally sounds insane.

13:24.263 --> 13:25.598
Men are not mind-readers.

13:25.623 --> 13:26.880
If she doesn't say anything,

13:26.905 --> 13:28.122
how am I supposed to know
how she's feeling?

13:28.147 --> 13:30.547
Eh, he does kind of have a point.

13:30.941 --> 13:32.508
Okay, fine.

13:32.533 --> 13:34.839
I will concede to his
if he concedes to mine...

13:34.874 --> 13:36.984
that this policy is really important.

13:37.009 --> 13:39.797
It's weird, though, that you
support this policy so much,

13:39.832 --> 13:41.098
just 'cause on the night of the party,

13:41.133 --> 13:45.069
technically you would've been busted.

13:45.104 --> 13:47.137
I was sober that whole night.

13:47.173 --> 13:49.339
Well, you might've been,
but hipster dude

13:49.374 --> 13:52.409
with that bolo tie you
brought home definitely wasn't.

13:52.444 --> 13:55.846
- Bolo tie?
- Ooh, yeah, he was gone.

14:03.889 --> 14:05.522
You want to get out of here?

14:05.557 --> 14:07.290
Where's my bolo tie?

14:07.326 --> 14:09.259
It's around your neck, sweetie.

14:09.294 --> 14:11.127
Come on. Let's go.

14:13.565 --> 14:14.964
Oh.

14:14.999 --> 14:16.966
Oh, so bolo ties are your thing?

14:17.001 --> 14:18.300
Not always.

14:18.336 --> 14:21.503
The point is, Ana, even though
you soberly consented,

14:21.539 --> 14:22.872
Mumford & Sons could not.

14:22.907 --> 14:24.774
So congrats

14:24.809 --> 14:27.443
on violating your beloved policy.

14:27.478 --> 14:29.854
- She isn't wrong.
- Nope.

14:29.879 --> 14:33.382
Yeah, you know, you would know.
You're always in violation.

14:33.417 --> 14:35.151
Luca is never sober.

14:35.186 --> 14:36.685
Facts.

14:36.721 --> 14:38.316
Okay, but we're in a relationship.

14:38.341 --> 14:40.426
So? The policy does not care.

14:40.451 --> 14:41.891
No, it definitely does not.

14:41.926 --> 14:44.360
People in relationships,
dudes with no game,

14:44.402 --> 14:46.086
girls with... bad taste,

14:46.111 --> 14:47.971
and dudes who have no self awareness

14:47.999 --> 14:49.966
on the dance floor, it screws everyone.

14:50.001 --> 14:52.368
All right, look,
I-I get that this policy

14:52.403 --> 14:54.903
has its flaws, but if it makes people

14:54.938 --> 14:57.172
slow down and think,
that's a good thing.

14:57.207 --> 14:59.675
I mean, if we had it last week,
maybe Cash and that girl

14:59.710 --> 15:01.176
would have stopped and slowed down,

15:01.211 --> 15:04.413
and her credibility wouldn't be
called into question

15:04.448 --> 15:06.515
and Cash would still be here.

15:06.550 --> 15:08.684
- Still be here?
- Yeah.

15:08.719 --> 15:10.352
So this is about dude?

15:10.388 --> 15:12.321
What?

15:12.356 --> 15:13.589
Explains why you've been

15:13.624 --> 15:15.424
riding for this policy so hard.

15:15.459 --> 15:17.993
Whatever. On that note,

15:18.028 --> 15:20.296
I think I'm out.

15:20.331 --> 15:22.931
Oh, dude. Okay.

15:22.966 --> 15:26.201
Wow.

15:26.236 --> 15:28.904
It isn't about dude for me,
but apparently,

15:28.928 --> 15:30.741
it is for him.

15:33.523 --> 15:35.013
Dude, hello!

15:35.038 --> 15:38.264
<i>What began as a group debate
of a new policy at Cal U</i>

15:38.289 --> 15:40.713
<i>had suddenly turned into
a fight for me and Luca.</i>

15:40.738 --> 15:42.555
Why are you making
this whole thing about Cash?

15:42.590 --> 15:45.357
Mm, pretty sure <i> you're</i>
making it about Cash.

15:45.393 --> 15:46.826
What? When?

15:46.861 --> 15:48.928
You know, we're in there
discussing the policy,

15:48.963 --> 15:50.796
and it's not like I'm on dude's side.

15:50.832 --> 15:52.398
Really? 'Cause the other night,

15:52.433 --> 15:54.834
you really seemed like
you were Team Cash.

15:58.606 --> 16:02.156
- What's up?!
- Oh. Oh, hey.

16:02.181 --> 16:03.430
It's the curly-headed cup...

16:03.455 --> 16:06.277
Uh, they don't call me that anymore!

16:06.312 --> 16:08.947
So, how you doing?

16:08.982 --> 16:11.282
Good, good.

16:13.219 --> 16:15.486
Seriously? That's why you're so pressed?

16:15.522 --> 16:17.622
Well, I wasn't gonna talk about
your little "reunion"...

16:17.658 --> 16:19.123
- My reunion?
- ...but now you want to

16:19.159 --> 16:21.002
sit up here and defend dude,
talk about how you wish

16:21.027 --> 16:22.338
he was still here, so...

16:22.363 --> 16:23.628
First of all, that's not what I said,

16:23.664 --> 16:25.296
and second of all,
you're being delusional

16:25.331 --> 16:27.632
because nothing happened that night.

16:32.806 --> 16:34.472
What's up?

16:34.507 --> 16:36.240
- Oh!
- It's the curly-headed cup...

16:36.276 --> 16:39.410
Um, actually, they don't
call me that anymore.

16:39.446 --> 16:43.081
Such a lie. Five people have
called me "cup bitch" tonight.

16:43.116 --> 16:45.283
So, uh, how you doing?

16:45.318 --> 16:46.750
Good, good.

16:46.786 --> 16:49.287
Um... you look good.

16:49.322 --> 16:50.621
Thank you.

16:50.656 --> 16:53.124
I see you over there with your boy.

16:53.159 --> 16:55.460
You look happy.

16:55.495 --> 16:56.727
We are.

16:56.762 --> 16:59.297
You deserve it. You deserve it.

16:59.332 --> 17:01.732
Thank you. Well, it was
really good to see you.

17:01.767 --> 17:03.667
Yeah, same.

17:03.703 --> 17:05.269
So...

17:10.008 --> 17:11.808
You know what? That's... That's on me.

17:11.843 --> 17:13.675
Yeah. You know what? It is.

17:13.712 --> 17:15.078
Zoey, I'm sorry.

17:15.114 --> 17:16.746
All right, well, why don't you consider

17:16.781 --> 17:18.582
talking to me next time
rather than treating me

17:18.617 --> 17:20.016
like I'd ever be disloyal?

17:20.050 --> 17:22.118
You can go somewhere with that.

17:31.463 --> 17:32.962
Oh, honey.

17:32.998 --> 17:34.331
Watching "Rizzoli and Isles"

17:34.366 --> 17:36.766
is not gonna make you feel any better.

17:36.801 --> 17:38.034
It really isn't.

17:39.404 --> 17:41.004
Look, you and Luca are gonna be fine.

17:41.039 --> 17:43.106
Everybody knows that you don't
care is Cash is leaving.

17:43.142 --> 17:44.673
That's not what I'm upset about.

17:44.708 --> 17:46.175
It's this whole

17:46.210 --> 17:48.144
"Enthusiastic Sober Consent" thing.

17:48.179 --> 17:52.548
Like, on the surface,
Luca thought that he saw

17:52.583 --> 17:54.716
me and Cash doing something wrong,

17:54.752 --> 17:56.985
and when we dug in deeper,
he understood that it was

17:57.021 --> 17:58.687
a harmless situation.

17:58.722 --> 18:02.291
And it just feels like
the policy is kind of the same.

18:02.326 --> 18:04.527
Like, on the surface, it's super simple.

18:04.562 --> 18:06.795
It's here to protect us,
which is such a no-brainer.

18:06.830 --> 18:09.698
But when you dig in deeper,
you understand that it...

18:09.733 --> 18:12.535
it has its flaws, and I-I-I don't know.

18:12.570 --> 18:14.203
Like, maybe you're right.

18:14.238 --> 18:15.804
Maybe we don't need this whole thing.

18:15.839 --> 18:17.072
Yeah, or maybe I'm not.

18:17.107 --> 18:18.507
She's definitely not.

18:18.543 --> 18:19.975
No, look, do I want people to feel safe?

18:20.010 --> 18:21.510
Of course I do. I just... I worry that

18:21.546 --> 18:23.244
the policy's too black and white.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.579
Okay, yeah, fine.

18:24.614 --> 18:27.315
I-It doesn't solve everything, but look.

18:27.350 --> 18:30.085
It's making us talk
and think about stuff.

18:30.120 --> 18:33.922
Really uncomfortable stuff,
and my worry is, like,

18:33.957 --> 18:37.492
what is just talk
actually going to change?

18:37.527 --> 18:40.062
Okay, well, hopefully
it makes us more aware

18:40.097 --> 18:41.997
so that we can protect ourselves.

18:42.032 --> 18:43.965
And, you know, at the very least,

18:44.001 --> 18:46.702
be 100% accountable with each other.

18:46.737 --> 18:48.870
Yeah, true.

18:51.208 --> 18:54.142
Don't worry, she'll get it.

18:58.448 --> 19:00.214
Hey.

19:00.249 --> 19:02.049
Hey.

19:02.085 --> 19:05.753
Just wondering, uh, if I could
make things up to you.

19:05.778 --> 19:09.252
Maybe split these bottles of extremely,

19:09.279 --> 19:12.280
extremely non-alcoholic Mexican sodas?

19:15.587 --> 19:16.714
Can I come in?

19:16.852 --> 19:19.186
<i>May</i> you come in.

19:19.268 --> 19:20.701
Wh... Why is she like that?

19:20.737 --> 19:23.097
I don't know.

19:23.606 --> 19:26.774
Um... look.

19:26.809 --> 19:28.609
I'm sorry. I trust you.

19:28.644 --> 19:30.743
I should've trusted you enough
to talk to you about it.

19:33.682 --> 19:35.816
May I come in?

19:35.852 --> 19:38.251
Sure.

19:38.686 --> 19:39.886
I'm gonna need you to say that

19:39.921 --> 19:42.756
with a little more enthusiasm.

19:48.773 --> 19:50.147
I can't do this without alcohol.

19:50.172 --> 19:51.872
Yes, you can. You got this, okay?

19:51.907 --> 19:53.752
You're just in your head.
We both can do this.

19:53.777 --> 19:56.276
No booze for you, no dancing for me.

19:56.311 --> 19:58.812
We don't even need it.
We fi... Oh, this is my jam.

19:58.847 --> 20:00.611
No, no. You said we got this.

20:00.636 --> 20:02.899
I don't got a damn thing.

20:04.992 --> 20:06.307
Yeah, me neither.

20:08.211 --> 20:10.777
- Ugh.
- Hey! What...

20:10.813 --> 20:12.343
Hey, you ladies want some shots?
