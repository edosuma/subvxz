00:08.688 --> 00:10.054
<i>And teleportation.</i>

00:10.056 --> 00:13.090
<i>There is a shadow war going
on between us and Ultra...</i>

00:13.092 --> 00:15.659
<i>- No!
- ... the secret organization that hunts us.</i>

00:15.661 --> 00:17.962
<i>The only way to keep my
species from going extinct</i>

00:17.964 --> 00:19.663

00:19.665 --> 00:23.866

00:25.870 --> 00:27.737
Stephen. I'll check on Astrid for you.

00:27.739 --> 00:29.539
I've seen what Ultra does
to humans who know too much.

00:29.541 --> 00:32.741
- Don't want to make a mess, do we?
- (SCREAMING)

00:32.744 --> 00:35.378
- How long do I have to stay here for?
- Until it's safe.

00:35.380 --> 00:37.346
But you have to let us protect you.

00:37.348 --> 00:39.281
You're the reason I need
protection in the first place.

00:39.283 --> 00:40.683
So, what happened with
your mom's boyfriend?

00:40.685 --> 00:42.852
There were times that I was
sure he was using his powers.

00:42.854 --> 00:44.721
Maybe it wasn't him using powers.

00:44.723 --> 00:45.722
It's Luca.

00:46.790 --> 00:48.024
He's breaking out.

Stephen, heading out?

01:50.762 --> 01:53.197
Yeah. Running late.

01:53.199 --> 01:55.965
Astrid's father called again.

01:56.197 --> 01:58.732
He's really worried. He hasn't
heard from her in 24 hours.

02:00.434 --> 02:02.101
You don't seem concerned at all.

02:02.103 --> 02:03.569
What are you asking me, Mom?

02:03.571 --> 02:06.906
Where is she? I know she wouldn't
go anywhere without telling you.

02:06.908 --> 02:10.109
All I can say is that
Astrid'll be home soon.

02:10.110 --> 02:11.978
Okay? I need you to trust me.

02:11.980 --> 02:15.548
Hey, this is not some game, you're
messing with people's lives here.

02:17.235 --> 02:21.105
Now, if you need my help,
you know you can come to me.

02:21.107 --> 02:22.339
I know.

02:22.341 --> 02:23.707
I know, and I would.

02:27.078 --> 02:28.278
But I gotta go.

02:40.158 --> 02:41.658
(GROANING)

02:41.660 --> 02:43.326
This is just sad.

02:43.328 --> 02:46.296
You rescue Astrid from Ultra,
you can't even clean yourself up.

02:47.632 --> 02:49.799
Are you here to make fun of me?

02:49.801 --> 02:51.300
Me?

02:51.302 --> 02:53.836
No, you look pretty pitiful enough already.

02:55.605 --> 02:56.605
Hand it over.

03:05.883 --> 03:08.116
You were right. About Astrid.

03:08.118 --> 03:09.851
God, that's good to hear.

03:11.154 --> 03:12.754
I can always stop.

03:12.756 --> 03:14.623
Or I can be a better patient.

03:17.627 --> 03:19.027
How's she doing anyway?

03:20.297 --> 03:22.064
She's fine.

03:22.066 --> 03:24.733
You saved her life.

03:24.735 --> 03:26.568
Guess the two of you are pretty close, huh?

03:30.973 --> 03:32.240
When I was lying there,

03:33.676 --> 03:35.010
bleeding out,

03:35.012 --> 03:36.878
not sure if I was gonna make it...

03:38.681 --> 03:40.648
it wasn't Astrid I was thinking about.

03:41.684 --> 03:43.718
You lost a lot of blood.

03:59.801 --> 04:02.569
Stephen, I know I've told
you before how I feel about...

04:02.571 --> 04:06.107
You sent a kill squad after my
best friend, tried to gun her down,

04:06.109 --> 04:08.542
in cold blood. She is a civilian!

04:08.544 --> 04:12.312
Astrid Finch was seen consorting
with a known rogue paranormal.

04:13.781 --> 04:15.181
(TREMBLING)

04:15.183 --> 04:18.252
She met John through me, accidentally.

04:18.254 --> 04:20.053
Before we parted ways.

04:20.055 --> 04:22.155
She is no threat to Ultra.

04:22.157 --> 04:24.124
Well, I wish that was the case.

04:24.126 --> 04:25.792
Sadly, it's not.

04:25.984 --> 04:29.819
Any coordination between a
paranormal and a human poses a threat.

04:29.821 --> 04:32.922
It is my job to eliminate those
threats. It's standard protocol.

04:32.924 --> 04:35.291
We had a deal.

04:35.293 --> 04:37.793
I agreed to work for Ultra, you promised
my friends and family would be safe.

04:37.795 --> 04:41.164
And our deal did not include you revealing
your powers to a high school girl.

04:41.166 --> 04:43.099
Now, perhaps if you had shown
a little bit more discretion,

04:43.101 --> 04:46.836
- she wouldn't be in this situation, would she?
- Okay, maybe it is my fault.

04:46.838 --> 04:48.904
But I still need to erase
her name from the system.

04:48.906 --> 04:50.105
Not gonna happen.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.509
- Then I quit.
- Really? Is that wise?

04:53.511 --> 04:55.310
You think you can strong-arm me?

04:55.312 --> 04:57.212
After what you just did?

04:57.214 --> 04:59.247
You and me. We're done.

05:02.485 --> 05:04.486
Look, I just want to
know if my dad is okay.

05:04.488 --> 05:06.921
<i>TIM: Without making
any emotional judgments,</i>

05:06.923 --> 05:09.992
<i>I can tell you that he spent most of
the morning checking various hospitals</i>

05:09.994 --> 05:12.127
<i>to see whether you've been
admitted as a Jane Doe.</i>

05:12.129 --> 05:13.862
I... I want to speak to him.

05:13.864 --> 05:16.931
And my phone doesn't work down here,
so can you please call him for me Tim?

05:16.933 --> 05:18.133
That is your name, right?

05:18.135 --> 05:20.001
<i>Yes, it's an acronym for...</i>

05:20.003 --> 05:22.770
<i>- Can you do it?
- If you're asking whether it's within my capabilities...</i>

05:22.772 --> 05:24.238
The answer is no.

05:25.307 --> 05:27.141
Don't take it out on Tim.

05:27.143 --> 05:29.243
He can only do what he's programmed to do.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.812
Then program him to call my dad.

05:30.814 --> 05:32.113
(SIGHING)

05:33.181 --> 05:35.316
Sorry Astrid. Can't do it.

05:35.318 --> 05:37.084
It's not safe.

05:37.086 --> 05:40.087
As long as you're still a target for
Ultra, you gotta stay off the grid.

05:41.956 --> 05:43.391
Look, I'm sorry.

05:43.393 --> 05:45.493
Tim's protocols are in
place to keep us safe.

05:47.929 --> 05:50.464
You know, as leader,

05:50.466 --> 05:52.332
Cara is the only one who could...

05:52.334 --> 05:54.467
So, Cara's the person I
need to be speaking to?

05:58.372 --> 06:00.040
I was just gonna find you.

06:00.042 --> 06:01.909
Here, it's the warmest of the bunch.

06:01.911 --> 06:03.109
I need to call home.

06:04.278 --> 06:07.080
I'm sorry, Astrid. That can't happen.

06:07.082 --> 06:09.215
You guys don't get it.

06:09.217 --> 06:11.751
I'm not like you. I can't
talk to my dad telepathically,

06:11.753 --> 06:14.154
and right now, he does
not even know if I'm alive.

06:14.156 --> 06:16.456
And that is the only thing
that is keeping him safe.

06:18.259 --> 06:20.460
You should get comfortable.
You could be here a while.

06:25.832 --> 06:27.366
She's not gonna last down here.

06:27.368 --> 06:28.868
It's only a matter of time.

06:30.170 --> 06:32.004
Can't you pull some strings at Ultra?

06:32.006 --> 06:33.973
- No, I quit.
- What?

06:33.975 --> 06:36.275
I had to.

06:36.277 --> 06:39.311
They were putting Astrid in the
crosshairs, Jedikiah went too far this time.

06:39.313 --> 06:41.080
- Any other bombshells?
- There is.

06:41.082 --> 06:43.982
I... I think I felt a
breakout this morning,

06:43.984 --> 06:46.885
like I was in her head, telepathically.

06:46.887 --> 06:48.620
- Her?
- Yeah.

06:48.622 --> 06:51.223
For whatever reason, I could
feel that she was a girl.

06:51.225 --> 06:53.925
So you felt her? The
same way that you felt me?

06:56.496 --> 06:58.797
Not what I meant.

06:58.799 --> 07:02.901
Like I was seeing the world through
her eyes while I was sleeping.

07:02.903 --> 07:05.036
Through her eyes? How?

07:05.038 --> 07:07.438
I don't know, maybe this
breakout and I were...

07:07.440 --> 07:09.307
Well, I'll... I'll keep a lookout.

07:09.309 --> 07:11.375
Maybe I can get a read on her too.

07:11.377 --> 07:12.376
Okay.

07:18.683 --> 07:20.384
I'm glad you're here.

07:20.386 --> 07:23.821
Massive tele-signature spiked
on Wall Street last night.

07:23.823 --> 07:25.523
Robbery at the Fed.

07:25.525 --> 07:28.058
But the readings for this breakout
were like nothing that we've ever seen.

07:28.060 --> 07:30.228
I'd be less concerned
with the supposed breakout,

07:30.230 --> 07:32.429
and more concerned about
the absence of your nephew.

07:34.132 --> 07:35.298
Where is Mr. Jameson?

07:36.935 --> 07:38.568
He quit.

07:38.570 --> 07:40.738
See that word implies he
had a choice in the matter.

07:42.306 --> 07:45.342
Yes. Well, you and I both
know he's a little hardheaded.

07:45.344 --> 07:48.077
Like his father. But he'll
come around eventually.

07:48.079 --> 07:50.413
Oh, I think it'll be far sooner than that.

08:17.007 --> 08:19.008
What do you say, Stephen?
Have you got a minute?

08:21.778 --> 08:24.913
An unfortunate debacle,
Ultra going after your friend.

08:24.915 --> 08:28.784
Especially since the whole thing could
have been avoided had you come to me sooner.

08:28.786 --> 08:32.054
What are you saying, you're on my
side? It's all my uncle's fault?

08:32.056 --> 08:35.457
I understand the burdens you bear, Stephen.

08:35.458 --> 08:38.458
All of them. And I want to help you.

08:38.461 --> 08:42.397
Okay. Clear Astrid's name.
Call off the kill squad.

08:42.399 --> 08:44.332
Indeed I could.

08:44.334 --> 08:45.466
What's the catch?

08:47.436 --> 08:50.072
I need you to bring me a rogue breakout.

08:50.074 --> 08:51.907
Her name is Cassandra Smythe.

08:51.909 --> 08:54.141
Extremely powerful and dangerous.

08:54.143 --> 08:57.778
Okay, but there's gotta be other
agents with more experience.

08:57.780 --> 09:02.217
Well, you've shown a certain knack for
solving problems other agents can't.

09:02.219 --> 09:06.287
If successful, you have my word
no harm shall come to your friend.

09:06.289 --> 09:07.288
So...

09:09.358 --> 09:10.891
Do we have a deal, Stephen?

09:16.765 --> 09:18.232
I still don't get it.

09:18.234 --> 09:20.267
Why go through all this
trouble for one breakout?

09:22.771 --> 09:24.138
Because she's my daughter.

09:29.360 --> 09:36.460
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

09:44.832 --> 09:47.233
STEPHEN: Meet Cassandra
Smythe, the Founder's daughter,

09:47.235 --> 09:49.301
and bank robber extraordinaire.

09:49.303 --> 09:51.671
Who robs a bank and doesn't
make off with the cash?

09:51.673 --> 09:53.840
She must have known Ultra
would be tracking her.

09:53.842 --> 09:57.443
A hot paranormal mess. Mmm.

09:57.445 --> 09:58.845
Must have gotten her looks from her momma.

09:58.847 --> 10:01.213
It's a mess the Founder
wants me to clean up.

10:01.215 --> 10:04.183
So, all we have to do is turn her
over to the old man and Astrid's clear?

10:04.185 --> 10:06.418
It's easier said than done.

10:06.420 --> 10:08.520
The way she teleported those
police cars without touching them,

10:08.522 --> 10:09.788
I've never seen anything like it.

10:09.790 --> 10:11.290
JOHN: She's a synergist.

10:12.959 --> 10:15.260
RUSSELL: What? No way.

10:15.262 --> 10:17.229
It would explain why I
can't get a read on her.

10:17.231 --> 10:18.964
Someone want to catch me up here?

10:18.966 --> 10:23.434
A synergist is a breakout whose
parents are both paranormal.

10:23.436 --> 10:25.837
The theory is, they have heightened powers.

10:25.839 --> 10:28.840
It makes sense. If the
Founder is Cassandra's father,

10:28.842 --> 10:30.408
maybe her mom is one of us too.

10:31.544 --> 10:33.111
Okay.

10:33.113 --> 10:37.215
I mean, if she is, you know, a
synergist, what does that mean for us?

10:37.217 --> 10:39.450
RUSSELL: Nothing.

10:39.452 --> 10:42.553
If we can't figure out how
to find her off that drive.

10:43.788 --> 10:44.989
RUSSELL: Irene...

10:44.991 --> 10:46.590
I'm gonna check on Astrid.

10:46.592 --> 10:49.593
- Let me know if you get a hit on Cassandra.
- Stephen?

10:49.595 --> 10:51.529
Why don't you keep this between us for now?

10:51.531 --> 10:53.731
You don't want to get Astrid's hopes up.

10:53.733 --> 10:55.699
Yeah, okay.

10:55.701 --> 10:57.768
You on board with all this?

10:57.770 --> 11:00.738
Making deals with the Founder?

11:00.740 --> 11:03.007
You don't think Stephen's
getting ahead of himself?

11:03.009 --> 11:06.343
What? You don't like the chances of
Stephen finding a super powerful breakout,

11:06.345 --> 11:09.112
capturing her and then trading
her for Astrid's freedom

11:09.114 --> 11:11.814
with a mysterious paranormal
who's name we don't even know?

11:11.816 --> 11:13.216
So why are you letting him do this?

11:15.986 --> 11:17.820
'Cause we don't have a choice.

11:24.362 --> 11:26.996
That's impressive, honey.

11:26.998 --> 11:31.133
For my next trick, I'm going
to make the magic fork...

11:31.135 --> 11:33.036
- (DOORBELL RINGING)
- (FORK CLATTERING)

11:33.038 --> 11:35.171
Oops, I'm still working on that one.

11:36.740 --> 11:37.740
I got it.

11:41.411 --> 11:43.412
You got a minute?

11:43.414 --> 11:44.713
I'd like to talk.

11:44.715 --> 11:45.781
About what?

11:45.783 --> 11:47.450
There are those within our organization

11:47.452 --> 11:49.785
who don't take too kindly
to quitters, Stephen.

11:49.787 --> 11:51.087
The Founder?

11:51.089 --> 11:53.922
Is this when you remind
me what happened to my dad?

11:53.924 --> 11:56.225
You can save it. I'll take my chances.

11:56.227 --> 12:01.262
Given your history, I would expect
you to be a little bit more cautious.

12:01.264 --> 12:04.265
And if he's contacted you in any
way, I would expect you to tell me.

12:04.267 --> 12:06.134
I don't have to tell you anything.

12:06.136 --> 12:08.336
I don't work for you anymore.

12:08.338 --> 12:11.740
I'm sorry about what happened
to Astrid, I truly am,

12:11.742 --> 12:14.977
but I am warning you, the Founder
is nobody to be trifled with.

12:14.979 --> 12:19.847
And any promises he makes you, are
meant to serve his purposes alone.

12:19.849 --> 12:23.384
If you are truly sorry, you
would do something about it.

12:23.386 --> 12:25.052
Thank you for your concern.

12:25.054 --> 12:27.822
Regardless of what you think
of me, I've never lied to you.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.331
What was that about? Why
didn't your uncle come in?

12:37.333 --> 12:40.300
I quit working for him today.

12:40.302 --> 12:43.270
Did something happen between you two?

12:43.272 --> 12:47.374
(SIGHING) I'm just not sure his
company is the right fit for me anymore.

12:47.376 --> 12:49.110
So what does that have to do with Astrid?

12:50.678 --> 12:52.012
I heard him say her name.

12:52.014 --> 12:54.148
Nothing. I was just saying,

12:54.150 --> 12:56.950
the reason I quit is because I want
to spend more time with my friends.

12:56.952 --> 12:58.785
You know, like her.

12:58.787 --> 13:00.920
Friends who are hiding
under a rock some place?

13:02.657 --> 13:04.824
Come on Stephen, you're gonna
have to do better than that.

13:14.234 --> 13:17.837
I never should have let
you get close to him.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.940
I thought it might bring you some peace
with your dad's disappearance if you did,

13:20.942 --> 13:25.278
but instead, working for your uncle
has just turned you into your father.

13:25.280 --> 13:28.113
Now you're living some secret
life, apart from your family.

13:28.115 --> 13:29.148
Just like he did.

13:33.687 --> 13:35.054
And then he left us.

13:43.329 --> 13:46.065
Hey. Any leads on the Founder's wild child?

13:46.067 --> 13:48.366
Uh, technically, we've got like 20.

13:48.368 --> 13:50.402
CARA: Her tele-signature's
all over the island.

13:50.404 --> 13:53.672
It's why I can't get a read on her,
it's like she's everywhere all at once.

13:53.674 --> 13:55.841
We got these hits at
hotels across the city.

13:55.843 --> 13:58.443
The Waldorf, the Essex,
the Quin, the Plaza.

13:58.445 --> 14:01.346
A woman of style and substance.

14:01.348 --> 14:02.947
You taking notes, Cara?

14:02.949 --> 14:04.048
(PULSING)

14:09.222 --> 14:10.822
She's at the Gosford.

14:11.924 --> 14:14.291
I'm not getting anything
on her telepathically.

14:14.293 --> 14:18.029
I don't know how, but I saw her again.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.898
I could feel where she was.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.700
Maybe you two are connected.

14:22.702 --> 14:24.435
If she's as powerful as we think she is,

14:24.437 --> 14:26.337
we can't just take her head-on.

14:26.339 --> 14:28.039
Okay. Then, what's the plan?

14:28.041 --> 14:31.275
You go undercover and bring in the
breakout you have a psychic connection with.

14:31.277 --> 14:32.343
Undercover?

14:33.878 --> 14:36.347
You know what they say, Stevie?

14:36.349 --> 14:38.949
You catch more flies with honey.

14:38.951 --> 14:39.950
You're the honey.

14:44.422 --> 14:46.656
<i>STEPHEN: (THINKING) I don't know, guys,
you really think this is gonna work?</i>

14:46.658 --> 14:48.759
<i>CARA: All you have to do is
get her guard down long enough</i>

14:48.761 --> 14:50.360
<i>to slap the suppression cuff on her wrist.</i>

14:50.362 --> 14:51.928
I'll be with you the whole time.

14:51.930 --> 14:54.231
And I'm here for, you know...

14:54.233 --> 14:55.999
gigolo advice.

14:56.001 --> 14:58.268
Now, get in there, stud.

14:58.270 --> 15:01.704
<i>STEPHEN: (THINKING) Maybe I was
wrong guys. I don't see her anywhere.</i>

15:01.706 --> 15:05.207
I am so sorry. I didn't see you.

15:05.209 --> 15:09.379
- It's her. She's here.
- RUSSELL: But I don't know how I missed you.

15:09.381 --> 15:12.214
But I don't know how I missed you.

15:12.216 --> 15:14.049
Smooth. Real smooth.

15:14.051 --> 15:16.686
<i>(THINKING) Okay, shut up, if she's
as powerful as we think she might be...</i>

15:16.688 --> 15:19.655
It's okay, after two of these,
I suppose I had it coming.

15:19.657 --> 15:20.823
(CHUCKLING)

15:22.358 --> 15:23.826
I'm Stephen.

15:23.828 --> 15:25.761
By the way.

15:25.763 --> 15:28.063
Cassie. Charmed.

15:28.065 --> 15:29.098
Sort of.

15:30.834 --> 15:32.201
Let me buy you another.

15:32.203 --> 15:33.235
Please.

15:34.237 --> 15:35.304
Another martini.

15:36.839 --> 15:38.774
So, Cassie, what brings you downtown?

15:38.776 --> 15:41.075
I'm looking for fun.

15:41.077 --> 15:42.877
And I think I just found it.

15:51.592 --> 15:53.300
Wow, so high school in England.

15:53.366 --> 15:55.207
They call it secondary school over there.

15:55.209 --> 15:56.275
What was that like?

15:56.277 --> 15:58.977
- Um, British?
- (SNORTING)

15:58.979 --> 16:01.780
Okay. And Brown. I'm impressed.

16:01.782 --> 16:03.949
Don't be. My Dad was an alum.

16:03.951 --> 16:06.017
He got me in. Made me go.

16:06.019 --> 16:07.619
It's typical.

16:07.621 --> 16:09.153
You don't sound too fond of him.

16:10.690 --> 16:13.725
Understatement. But, you
wouldn't understand...

16:13.727 --> 16:16.894
and anyways, this isn't exactly
"pick up at the bar" talk.

16:16.896 --> 16:19.564
Oh, so I'm picking you up now?

16:19.566 --> 16:21.732
No. I'm picking you up.

16:22.901 --> 16:24.668
Right. Um.

16:24.670 --> 16:26.837
Well, you can still tell
me about your old man,

16:26.839 --> 16:29.006
I promise to keep the overshare between us.

16:29.008 --> 16:30.208
(LAUGHING)

16:31.210 --> 16:33.777
Um, my Dad's...

16:33.779 --> 16:35.682
powerful. Opinionated.

16:35.683 --> 16:38.814
A man who doesn't care
about anyone, or anything.

16:39.718 --> 16:41.652
He just wants to win.

16:41.654 --> 16:43.487
At all costs.

16:43.489 --> 16:46.690
You just described nearly
every guy on the Fortune 500.

16:46.692 --> 16:48.358
Mmm-hmm. You don't get it.

16:49.660 --> 16:54.063
My Dad takes ruthlessness
to a whole new level.

16:54.065 --> 16:56.333
And, of course, he wants me
to follow in the family biz.

16:56.335 --> 16:59.369
- Can I get you one more?
- Which is... Uh, thank you, I'm good.

16:59.371 --> 17:00.637
He'll have another.

17:02.706 --> 17:04.773
You're worried I'm trying to get you drunk.

17:04.776 --> 17:06.075
No.

17:06.077 --> 17:07.977
Why? Should I be?

17:07.979 --> 17:10.613
What exactly are you
looking for tonight, Stephen?

17:11.882 --> 17:14.017
How about we get out of here?

17:14.019 --> 17:17.586
The view from the roof is incredible.

17:17.588 --> 17:18.921
Sure. Lead the way.

17:20.924 --> 17:23.626
<i>STEPHEN: Cara, I have her for
now, are you ready in the lair?</i>

17:23.627 --> 17:24.154
I'm on it.

17:24.155 --> 17:26.483
As soon as you get the suppression
cuff on her, teleport her back here.

17:27.997 --> 17:30.032
CASSIE: God, I love this place.

17:30.034 --> 17:31.900
- Yeah, it's the best.
- And the worst.

17:31.902 --> 17:33.802
At least for me.

17:33.804 --> 17:35.671
It's complicated.

17:35.673 --> 17:37.139
Brings back memories.

17:37.141 --> 17:38.339
Dad again?

17:38.341 --> 17:40.042
In a sense.

17:40.044 --> 17:41.877
Again, you wouldn't understand.

17:41.879 --> 17:43.278
Well, you'd be surprised.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.713
(BEEPING) (LOCKING)

17:45.848 --> 17:48.016
I've been waiting for you to do that.

17:48.018 --> 17:50.618
- Waiting for...
- AGENT: Jameson! Freeze.

17:50.620 --> 17:52.220
- Who the hell are they?
- It's complicated.

18:03.031 --> 18:04.031
(SMASHING)

18:15.210 --> 18:18.012
STEPHEN: She doesn't know where
she is, her powers are blocked,

18:18.014 --> 18:21.148
and the second I contact
her dad, she's on her way.

18:21.150 --> 18:22.149
Make it fast.

18:26.822 --> 18:29.690
Hey, how are you holding up?

18:29.692 --> 18:31.858
(SIGHING)

18:31.860 --> 18:36.029
Your friend said you were off
on some kind of secret mission.

18:36.031 --> 18:39.099
Yeah, well, mission accomplished. Almost.

18:39.101 --> 18:40.867
Meaning?

18:40.869 --> 18:43.270
Meaning everything's going to be okay.

18:43.272 --> 18:44.771
I'm gonna get you home, Astrid.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.109
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

18:51.612 --> 18:54.047
This doesn't look like any
part of Ultra I remember.

18:57.885 --> 19:01.186
This is an off-site Ultra safe house.

19:01.188 --> 19:03.789
We're holding you here until
we get further instructions.

19:03.791 --> 19:06.191
Can't we just get it over with already?

19:06.193 --> 19:08.561
Get what over with?

19:08.563 --> 19:11.631
I'm a rogue paranormal
using my powers in public.

19:11.633 --> 19:12.698
I know the drill.

19:13.700 --> 19:15.735
Now, you give me that shot.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.903
And you take my powers away, right?

19:17.905 --> 19:20.072
It sounds like you want that to happen.

19:20.074 --> 19:23.876
Why do you think I let
myself get caught by you?

19:23.878 --> 19:26.011
I knew you were conning me the whole time.

19:26.013 --> 19:28.747
Why would anybody want
their powers stripped?

19:28.749 --> 19:33.818
Well, if you have to ask, then you've
obviously already drunk the Ultra Kool-Aid.

19:33.820 --> 19:35.153
Try me.

19:35.155 --> 19:39.223
We've already established
I'm down with oversharing.

19:39.225 --> 19:42.727
How much do you know about
my Dad? The great Founder?

19:42.729 --> 19:43.995
About Ultra?

19:44.997 --> 19:46.765
As much as I need to.

19:46.767 --> 19:48.833
A lot of it's classified.

19:48.835 --> 19:54.071
When I was a kid, my Dad used
to levitate me around the house.

19:54.073 --> 19:55.639
Like I was Supergirl.

19:56.775 --> 19:58.709
Both my parents had powers.

19:58.711 --> 20:01.112
So when I developed them, it seemed normal.

20:01.114 --> 20:03.147
I never really understood what we were.

20:03.149 --> 20:05.649
Other than special.

20:05.651 --> 20:07.050
It's what my dad called us.

20:08.286 --> 20:12.088
And I never really understood
what he did, either.

20:12.090 --> 20:14.325
Until last month.

20:14.327 --> 20:18.094
I was coming home from
Providence as a surprise.

20:18.096 --> 20:21.298
And he didn't know I was coming, so
he wasn't blocking me telepathically,

20:21.300 --> 20:23.300
like he normally did.

20:23.302 --> 20:26.303
But this time, I saw inside him.

20:26.305 --> 20:28.071
I saw

20:28.073 --> 20:29.940
who he really is.

20:29.942 --> 20:31.208
What did you see?

20:36.247 --> 20:38.114
(HEAVY BREATHING)

20:41.352 --> 20:43.686
That he's a monster.

20:43.688 --> 20:46.055
And he wants me to be the same.

20:46.057 --> 20:47.957
But I won't do it.

20:47.959 --> 20:50.693
I won't work with him.

20:50.695 --> 20:54.664
And the only way to make sure that
he leaves me alone is to become human.

20:56.366 --> 20:58.700
But he'd never take your powers himself.

20:58.702 --> 21:03.272
Now that you've captured me in front
of Ultra, he doesn't have a choice.

21:10.881 --> 21:12.314
You shouldn't be out of bed.

21:13.315 --> 21:16.184
Never was one for lying around.

21:16.186 --> 21:20.021
You were never one for putting
down work and picking up a...

21:21.123 --> 21:22.758
A book of poetry?

21:22.760 --> 21:24.993
It's for Astrid. To help her pass the time.

21:24.995 --> 21:25.994
Hmm.

21:27.029 --> 21:28.363
So...

21:28.365 --> 21:30.664
Are we gonna talk about what happened?

21:31.767 --> 21:32.934
Nothing happened.

21:34.303 --> 21:36.804
I kissed you.

21:36.806 --> 21:38.672
And you kissed me back.

21:38.674 --> 21:40.074
It's old habits.

21:40.076 --> 21:42.911
Well, I'm pretty sure
that one's not dead yet.

21:42.913 --> 21:46.079
It doesn't matter, what I want.

21:46.081 --> 21:48.682
When we're together, I can't be impartial.

21:49.718 --> 21:51.619
You of all people should understand.

21:53.822 --> 21:56.123
I can't put my feelings before the group.

21:56.125 --> 21:57.124
(DOOR OPENING)

22:00.261 --> 22:03.897
I'm, uh, going topside to make
arrangements with the Founder.

22:03.899 --> 22:05.765
I'll be back soon.

22:05.767 --> 22:09.236
And, just so you know, Cassie
thinks she's in an Ultra safehouse.

22:09.238 --> 22:11.939
Wait, then why isn't
she climbing the walls?

22:11.941 --> 22:13.706
You're not gonna believe this.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.809
She wants her powers removed.

22:15.811 --> 22:18.912
That's why she's been robbing
banks and taunting her dad.

22:18.914 --> 22:21.614
She's trying to force him
to give her the needle.

22:21.616 --> 22:23.850
Does she have any idea
what that does to you?

22:23.852 --> 22:25.485
She wants out.

22:25.487 --> 22:28.621
The Founder must have known, that's
why he came to me, so that I could

22:28.623 --> 22:31.023
save Cassie from herself.

22:31.025 --> 22:33.693
The man has all of Ultra at his fingertips,

22:33.695 --> 22:38.029
and he asks you to bring in the most
powerful breakout we've ever seen. Alone.

22:38.031 --> 22:41.032
- Something's not right.
- Well, it's a little late for second guessing.

22:41.034 --> 22:43.068
The deal is in place, if Astrid wants to...

22:43.070 --> 22:45.236
What happened to this girl that
she wants her powers stripped?

22:47.073 --> 22:48.873
Something tells me this is about more

22:48.875 --> 22:51.343
than just a wild child
being reined in by Daddy.

22:51.345 --> 22:52.910
Like what?

22:52.912 --> 22:55.780
Like maybe the Founder has something
more in mind for his daughter

22:55.782 --> 22:57.181
that will come back to haunt us.

22:57.183 --> 23:00.918
No. You are pulling this out of nowhere.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.587
We are trading Cassie for Astrid.

23:02.589 --> 23:05.222
That's the deal I made and
that's what I'm gonna to deliver.

23:05.224 --> 23:07.124
No, we're not.

23:07.126 --> 23:10.160
Until we figure out what's
going on, Cassie stays here.

23:21.497 --> 23:24.632
How many times have I told you, I
don't like people barging in to...

23:29.471 --> 23:31.273
Uh, that's fine, she's family.

23:34.877 --> 23:36.844
So this is Ultra.

23:36.846 --> 23:40.615
Marla, had I known you were coming, I
would have arranged for a warmer welcome.

23:40.617 --> 23:41.649
Save it.

23:42.984 --> 23:45.720
So, I suppose you're here
to talk about Stephen.

23:45.722 --> 23:46.887
Why did he quit?

23:48.557 --> 23:50.858
- What did he tell you?
- Lies.

23:50.860 --> 23:52.626
Lies that he learned from you.

23:52.628 --> 23:54.494
(STAMMERING) I don't
know what you're implying.

23:56.031 --> 23:57.497
Where's Astrid?

23:58.633 --> 24:01.468
I'm sorry, refresh me. What's an "Astrid"?

24:01.470 --> 24:05.605
Stephen's friend. The two of you were
talking about her last night at my house.

24:05.607 --> 24:08.275
Marla, I have absolutely no
idea what you're talking about.

24:08.277 --> 24:10.344
But if you want me to get in touch
with my friend at the Bureau...

24:10.346 --> 24:12.479
You have a history of
making people disappear.

24:14.349 --> 24:17.283
- If you're talking about your husband...
- You know I am.

24:17.285 --> 24:21.154
Now, I am warning you. If anything
happens to Astrid, or Stephen,

24:21.156 --> 24:25.358
or anyone close to us, I'm gonna go
to the police, and the newspapers,

24:25.360 --> 24:29.095
and I'm gonna use every resource at my
disposal to come after you and Ultra,

24:29.097 --> 24:31.264
and take you down.

24:31.266 --> 24:34.167
- Before you do anything rash...
- Go to hell, Jed.

24:37.171 --> 24:39.272
I'm sorry. Have we met?

24:40.440 --> 24:41.440
No.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.382
Always been your Achilles' heel, hasn't it?

24:49.384 --> 24:50.383
Family.

24:52.285 --> 24:54.186
I guess we all have our soft spots.

24:56.801 --> 24:58.334
<i>CARA: Tim?</i>

24:58.336 --> 25:00.803
Pull up everything you
can on Cassandra Smythe.

25:00.805 --> 25:04.407
<i>Cassandra Smythe. Born 1992, London.</i>

25:04.409 --> 25:07.643
<i>Graduated valedictorian,
Royal Halloway, 2009.</i>

25:07.645 --> 25:11.247
<i>Lettered in tennis, squash, and served
as editor of the school newspaper.</i>

25:11.249 --> 25:13.449
Okay, and past that?

25:13.451 --> 25:15.350
<i>Unfortunately, I am unable to gather
additional data beyond that date.</i>

25:16.386 --> 25:17.853
That doesn't make sense.

25:17.855 --> 25:19.622
We know she graduated from Brown.

25:19.624 --> 25:22.658
<i>- Someone there must have a record of her.
- Nothing whatsoever.</i>

25:22.660 --> 25:25.661
<i>Is it possible she isn't
who she says she is?</i>

25:25.663 --> 25:29.364
No, Tim, I think it's possible
she isn't who she thinks she is.

25:32.302 --> 25:34.169
Is it time to get my shot?

25:36.439 --> 25:37.739
Where's Stephen?

25:37.741 --> 25:39.841
- Who are you?
- I'm his partner.

25:39.843 --> 25:40.842
At Ultra.

25:42.845 --> 25:47.415
I just need to ask you a few more
questions before we process you.

25:47.417 --> 25:50.618
Whatever. Can we just get it
over with, what's the point?

25:50.620 --> 25:52.286
Tell me about Brown.

25:52.288 --> 25:53.988
What do you want to know?

25:53.990 --> 25:57.459
Where'd you live? What'd you
study? Who's your advisor?

26:00.195 --> 26:02.129
That's so...

26:02.131 --> 26:05.766
that's so strange, it just slipped my mind.

26:05.768 --> 26:10.204
What dorm, but I can... I
can picture it so clearly.

26:10.206 --> 26:12.639
Are you sure?

26:12.641 --> 26:15.409
If you don't believe me,
call Dr. Albert Lehrman.

26:15.411 --> 26:17.778
He's the professor who
guided me through my thesis.

26:19.181 --> 26:21.548
Which was what, exactly?

26:21.550 --> 26:24.417
I was helping him build a device that...

26:27.221 --> 26:28.288
that would...

26:29.824 --> 26:32.125
God, I don't understand.

26:32.127 --> 26:34.728
Why is my head so cloudy all of a sudden?

26:34.730 --> 26:36.529
It's okay, Cassie.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.566
You can just show me.

26:52.579 --> 26:54.380
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

27:05.125 --> 27:06.358
What did you see?

27:08.562 --> 27:11.130
Exactly what you said.

27:11.132 --> 27:14.133
Dr. Lehrman and the lab
where you two worked.

27:14.135 --> 27:17.802
STEPHEN: So you think they were messing
with her mind, planting false memories?

27:17.804 --> 27:22.141
It was Ultra. Room B36. She was
strapped to some sort of device.

27:22.143 --> 27:25.277
If they brainwashed her, how do
we know what's real and what's not?

27:25.279 --> 27:28.179
What is real is that
Astrid is stuck down here.

27:28.181 --> 27:31.716
And we have the one person that
we can trade for her safety.

27:31.718 --> 27:34.485
Cassie is more powerful
than anyone we've ever found.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.555
Don't you wanna know what
they were using her for?

27:36.557 --> 27:38.690
Ultra? I don't work there anymore.

27:38.692 --> 27:40.324
You still have access.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.292
Wow. (SIGHS)

27:42.294 --> 27:43.461
I can't believe this.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.730
Now you're holding Astrid hostage?

27:46.732 --> 27:49.300
If that's what you wanna call it.

27:49.302 --> 27:53.438
I will find out whatever it is you
wanna know about this Lehrman guy.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.606
- But after that...
- Astrid goes free.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.242
Astrid goes free.

28:02.146 --> 28:03.213
(DOOR OPENING)

28:51.228 --> 28:52.528
(HUMMING)

28:58.167 --> 29:01.402
It looks like your uncle failed
to revoke your badge when you quit.

29:01.404 --> 29:03.238
What are you doing here, Stephen?

29:03.240 --> 29:06.374
And more importantly, where is my daughter?

29:06.376 --> 29:07.809
I'm working on it.

29:07.811 --> 29:09.811
So you've gotten too
clever for your own boots?

29:09.813 --> 29:14.382
The only way you'd know about this lab
is if you'd already found Cassandra.

29:14.384 --> 29:15.683
(CRACKLING)

29:22.724 --> 29:24.692
Stephen's been gone for hours.

29:24.694 --> 29:27.394
He should have checked in with you
by now, telepathically or something.

29:27.396 --> 29:29.530
Maybe he's in a secure part of Ultra.

29:29.532 --> 29:31.799
Tim, can you get a lock on him?

29:31.801 --> 29:35.269
<i>Unfortunately, Stephen's signal has
gone cold since he entered the building.</i>

29:35.271 --> 29:37.337
That means he could be in
trouble and we wouldn't even know.

29:37.339 --> 29:39.406
I'm with John.

29:39.408 --> 29:40.808
If this Founder dude is willing
to mess over his own daughter,

29:40.810 --> 29:42.409
think what he'd do if he catches Stephen.

29:42.411 --> 29:44.511
JOHN: He'll have him killed.

29:44.513 --> 29:47.347
That's after he's tortured him
to find out where his daughter is,

29:47.349 --> 29:48.682
leading Ultra straight to us.

29:55.323 --> 29:57.191
John, what are you doing?

29:57.193 --> 29:58.992
Saving Stephen.

29:58.994 --> 30:01.561
- How?
- By making good on his promise to the Founder.

30:01.563 --> 30:04.864
CARA: If Stephen is in trouble and we
hand over Cassie now, we have nothing.

30:04.866 --> 30:08.334
No leverage. We do not do anything
until we know what we are up against.

30:08.336 --> 30:13.106
Mom? Dad? Ixnay on the ightfay,
you're upsetting the children.

30:13.108 --> 30:14.640
What's going on, is this about me?

30:14.642 --> 30:17.276
It's about a lot of things.
Better to stay out of it.

30:19.513 --> 30:21.547
John, this is not your call to make.

30:23.250 --> 30:25.284
I know you're leader now, Cara.

30:25.286 --> 30:27.186
But I'm taking Cassie back to her father.

30:27.188 --> 30:29.188
You do whatever you have to do.

30:32.759 --> 30:33.859
Who are you?

30:33.861 --> 30:35.594
You and I are taking a little trip.

30:35.596 --> 30:36.595
John...

30:46.318 --> 30:48.079
You had your chance, Stephen.

30:48.630 --> 30:49.943
You could have brought my daughter to me,

30:50.322 --> 30:52.990
but instead you chose to
complicate our arrangement

30:52.992 --> 30:55.660
by investigating things
that don't concern you.

30:55.662 --> 30:58.629
(STRUGGLING) What was in that room?

30:58.631 --> 31:02.566
You experimented on your own
child. What did you do to Cassie?

31:02.568 --> 31:04.501
Why does she think you're a monster?

31:04.503 --> 31:06.670
As I said, that's none of your concern.

31:08.106 --> 31:11.908
Now, I know that you have my Cassandra,

31:11.910 --> 31:15.145
and I'm going to give you one
chance to tell me where she is.

31:15.147 --> 31:19.282
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Okay. Okay,
okay, I'll bring her to you.

31:19.284 --> 31:20.851
I just need more time.

31:20.853 --> 31:22.552
Your time has run out.

31:32.697 --> 31:35.731
I've been inside your head before.

31:35.733 --> 31:39.268
I know how difficult it
is to read your thoughts.

31:39.270 --> 31:43.739
But once you're fitted with a port,
I'll have direct access to them.

31:46.810 --> 31:49.078
(MACHINE POWERING UP)

31:49.080 --> 31:52.848
Of course, I'll have access to all
your other dirty little secrets as well.

31:58.121 --> 32:00.022
Where are we?

32:00.024 --> 32:02.958
Around the corner from Ultra. It's
where you wanted us to bring you.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.793
So why aren't you bringing me in?

32:04.795 --> 32:07.195
I can't walk you to that
building, Cassie. Only you can.

32:07.197 --> 32:08.563
I don't understand.

32:14.603 --> 32:18.106
My father's inside. They've got Stephen.

32:18.108 --> 32:19.607
Dr. Lerhman.

32:19.609 --> 32:22.177
Dr. Lehrman was not your college advisor.

32:22.179 --> 32:26.213
He is an Ultra scientist who
experimented on you, tortured you,

32:26.215 --> 32:28.983
and he is about to do
the same thing to Stephen.

32:28.985 --> 32:31.052
Why did you bring me here?

32:31.054 --> 32:33.054
Why are you telling me all this?

32:33.056 --> 32:36.824
'Cause you're like us. You hate your
father and everything he stands for.

32:36.826 --> 32:39.260
You want to keep him
from hurting anyone else?

32:39.262 --> 32:41.595
Stephen is our best chance to stop him.

32:41.597 --> 32:46.267
He is working for us on the inside but
he is about to be exposed and tortured,

32:46.269 --> 32:50.728
and the only way to help him is
to give your father what he wants.

32:50.729 --> 32:51.729
You.

32:52.141 --> 32:54.007
- What are you doing?
- (BEEPING)

32:56.111 --> 32:58.244
I can't force you to
go back to him, Cassie.

32:58.246 --> 33:02.015
But if you wanna stop your
father, you'll save Stephen,

33:02.017 --> 33:05.552
and maybe he'll save all of us.

33:05.554 --> 33:10.023
I entrusted you with the most important
thing in the world. My daughter.

33:13.627 --> 33:15.861
- And you failed me.
- (ALARM SOUNDING)

33:15.863 --> 33:18.631
Sir! A breakout just teleported
into the operations room.

33:18.633 --> 33:19.732
Hi, Dad!

33:22.069 --> 33:24.204
- You looking for me?
- Cassandra.

33:26.940 --> 33:29.976
So this is how you thank the
agent who tracked me down?

33:29.978 --> 33:33.079
If anything, he deserves a promotion.

33:33.081 --> 33:35.648
What? Stephen didn't tell you I was coming?

33:37.150 --> 33:39.585
I guess he didn't want
to ruin the surprise.

33:39.587 --> 33:40.953
I kept my part of the deal.

33:42.255 --> 33:43.723
So it seems.

33:52.132 --> 33:54.032
What about Astrid?

33:54.034 --> 33:56.602
Oh, your friend is free to
return to her former life.

33:56.604 --> 33:58.870
She needn't fear our
organization ever again.

34:08.947 --> 34:10.649
Was this really necessary?

34:12.150 --> 34:15.987
Surely you don't think me such a
monster that you'd rather be human?

34:18.190 --> 34:21.992
I'm sorry, Daddy. I don't
know what I was thinking.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.967
- Ready?
- For what?

34:29.969 --> 34:33.103
- To go home?
- Really?

34:33.105 --> 34:37.041
Ultra wiped you from their
system. You're safe now.

34:37.043 --> 34:38.641
(BOTH LAUGHING)

34:39.878 --> 34:41.945
That's the most hugging
we've done since eighth grade.

34:41.947 --> 34:44.246
Well, if it wasn't for you
I wouldn't be going home.

34:44.248 --> 34:47.717
If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't
have been forced into hiding.

34:47.719 --> 34:50.587
Yeah, well. It has been an experience.

34:53.991 --> 34:56.626
Guess I go back to being
a regular human being now.

34:58.295 --> 35:01.263
I wish you could do the same.

35:01.265 --> 35:02.833
All of you.

35:02.834 --> 35:05.524
That you could live without
looking over your shoulder.

35:08.205 --> 35:10.539
- Just give me a sec.
- Yeah.

35:10.541 --> 35:12.508
Hi.

35:12.510 --> 35:13.509
Hey.

35:15.545 --> 35:18.514
I just wanna say thank you,
again, for saving my life.

35:18.516 --> 35:20.816
(CHUCKLES) Well, if I ever
need a bullet pulled...

35:20.818 --> 35:21.983
You should go to a hospital.

35:23.253 --> 35:24.986
Take care of yourself.

35:24.988 --> 35:25.954
You too.

35:32.061 --> 35:33.195
Let's get you home.

35:37.700 --> 35:38.700
CARA: John?

35:40.837 --> 35:42.104
We need to talk.

35:43.706 --> 35:46.541
I know what you're gonna say.
I shouldn't have done that.

35:46.543 --> 35:49.110
No, your gambit paid
off, we got Stephen back.

35:49.112 --> 35:52.780
The problem is, you took Cassie
and traded her to her father,

35:52.782 --> 35:55.182
- without my authority.
- But I made the right call.

35:55.184 --> 35:58.986
Wasn't your call to make. You overrode
my leadership in front of everyone.

36:01.823 --> 36:04.792
I am sorry if I humiliated you.

36:04.794 --> 36:06.761
This is not about me or my feelings.

36:06.763 --> 36:08.863
How are they supposed to respect
my decisions when you don't?

36:09.998 --> 36:11.999
Respect or obey, Cara?

36:12.001 --> 36:15.169
This attitude of yours is
dangerous for all of us.

36:15.171 --> 36:17.805
So this is my first warning?

36:17.807 --> 36:22.242
Defy you again and you'll have me
scrubbing the floors with a toothbrush?

36:22.244 --> 36:26.813
This is your last warning.
Do it again and you are gone.

36:26.815 --> 36:28.181
Okay.

36:28.183 --> 36:31.017
Don't walk away from me,
John, we are not through.

36:31.019 --> 36:35.088
I will not be chastised for
making the right damn decision!

36:35.090 --> 36:36.890
Keep your voice down.

36:36.892 --> 36:39.525
Let me save you the suspense, Cara.

36:39.527 --> 36:42.595
I am gonna do what I think
is best for our people,

36:42.596 --> 36:44.531
no matter who's leader down here.

36:44.536 --> 36:45.799
John, don't.

36:45.801 --> 36:50.569
And if you're gonna threaten to kick
me out every time I step out of line,

36:50.571 --> 36:52.038
you should just do it already.

36:54.841 --> 36:57.543
Finally some leadership
advice I can actually use.

36:58.978 --> 37:00.245
Pack your stuff.

37:02.549 --> 37:05.117
You can say your goodbyes,
and then you need to go.

37:06.853 --> 37:09.221
Goodbye, John. Good luck.

37:25.427 --> 37:26.962
Where are you going?

37:26.964 --> 37:28.363
Astrid's home.

37:29.966 --> 37:32.433
But then, you know that, don't you?

37:34.603 --> 37:37.839
Do I wanna know how you pulled that off?

37:37.841 --> 37:40.875
Not unless you wanna be in the
same boat Astrid was just in.

37:40.877 --> 37:43.411
Honey, what is going on?

37:43.413 --> 37:46.581
(CHUCKLING) I, um...

37:46.583 --> 37:49.917
don't even know where to begin.

37:49.919 --> 37:56.790
I got myself into something bigger and
more dangerous than I ever imagined,

37:56.792 --> 37:58.859
working for Ultra.

37:58.861 --> 38:03.497
I thought I was doing the right
thing, okay, for all of us.

38:03.499 --> 38:07.267
But you were right. I
should have listened to you.

38:07.269 --> 38:10.537
You're gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay.

38:10.539 --> 38:12.305
You, me and Luca, what are we?

38:13.541 --> 38:14.541
Really?

38:15.976 --> 38:17.844
The iron triangle.

38:17.846 --> 38:20.479
And who breaks the iron triangle?

38:20.481 --> 38:22.181
- No one.
- That's right.

38:22.183 --> 38:25.285
So whatever this is,
whatever you're going through,

38:25.287 --> 38:28.721
we're gonna get through it together, okay?

38:33.294 --> 38:36.595
Astrid's dad invited us to
stop by the cafe for a bite.

38:36.597 --> 38:38.464
He wants to say thanks.

38:38.466 --> 38:39.965
I think we should go.

38:39.967 --> 38:43.569
Okay, I'll meet you there. I'm
just gonna talk to Luca real quick.

38:43.571 --> 38:45.771
Oh, okay. See if you can get him to come.

38:47.641 --> 38:48.641
Okay.

38:55.481 --> 38:57.049
Got a sec?

38:57.051 --> 38:59.617
Um... depends.

38:59.619 --> 39:01.853
Are you gonna get all weird again?

39:01.855 --> 39:05.690
Because if this is about what happened
with Peter, you can chill. We're good.

39:05.692 --> 39:07.692
No, it's not about that.

39:07.694 --> 39:12.864
I've just noticed that you've been
acting a little different lately.

39:12.866 --> 39:14.532
I've been acting different?

39:15.801 --> 39:16.801
What's up, kettle?

39:17.837 --> 39:20.772
Okay. But seriously, I'm worried about you.

39:20.774 --> 39:23.775
Okay, I have been where you
are, I know what it's like,

39:23.777 --> 39:27.244
- and if there's anything that you want to tell me...
- No.

39:27.246 --> 39:29.981
Or show me, now's the time to do it.

39:32.884 --> 39:35.619
All right, don't make me read your mind.

39:35.621 --> 39:39.423
Damn it, I thought I was
being careful. How'd you know?

39:39.425 --> 39:40.761
You're my little brother, Luca.

39:40.762 --> 39:43.339
Of course I'm gonna
notice something like this.

39:43.462 --> 39:46.797
This totally sucks. You're
not gonna tell Mom, are you?

39:46.799 --> 39:48.732
No. This will be our secret.

39:48.734 --> 39:51.668
But you gotta be more
careful. There are rules, okay?

39:51.670 --> 39:53.737
- It is off-limits in the house.
- Yeah

39:55.339 --> 39:57.908
I didn't even like it that much.

39:57.910 --> 40:01.011
What is this... a bong? That's your secret?

40:01.013 --> 40:04.481
Yeah. What'd you think I was talking about?

40:07.618 --> 40:08.751
Do your homework.

40:12.356 --> 40:13.856
What are you going to do with me?

40:13.858 --> 40:16.559
Do with you? Nothing, darling.

40:16.561 --> 40:20.396
I just want for you to put all this
irresponsible behavior behind you.

40:20.398 --> 40:21.864
So you can return to school.

40:21.866 --> 40:24.033
You and I both know
I've never been to Brown.

40:24.035 --> 40:27.469
Oh darling, darling, will
you listen to yourself?

40:27.471 --> 40:29.405
You sound unhinged.

40:29.407 --> 40:31.707
Will you be so kind as to
give my daughter a sedative?

40:31.709 --> 40:34.576
No. No, get off me! I
don't need your drugs!

40:34.578 --> 40:36.778
It's okay, Cassie, it's
okay. Isn't that better?

40:36.780 --> 40:39.014
I'm going to put you on
the train to Providence now.

40:39.016 --> 40:40.649
Take her away.

40:40.651 --> 40:43.452
And activate the clean-up
unit tailing Astrid Finch.

40:44.687 --> 40:45.720
But Stephen...

40:46.756 --> 40:48.757
- You made a promise.
- It's okay, Cassie.

40:49.759 --> 40:51.026
It's already done.

40:51.028 --> 40:52.527
Three target's inside.

40:52.529 --> 40:54.062
No civilians. Weapons-free.

40:59.869 --> 41:02.370
<i>CASSIE: (THINKING) Stephen, are you there?</i>

41:02.372 --> 41:03.471
<i>Cassie, are you okay?</i>

41:05.441 --> 41:08.008
(TIRES SCREECHING)

41:08.010 --> 41:11.312
<i>CASSIE: They're going to kill her.
They're going to kill your friend.</i>

41:13.415 --> 41:14.482
What is it, Marla?

41:15.850 --> 41:17.418
Get down. Under the table.

41:17.420 --> 41:18.419
Now!

41:25.694 --> 41:26.860
No.

41:32.634 --> 41:34.969
No! No! No!

41:48.748 --> 41:51.850
I'm sorry. I should have told you sooner.
