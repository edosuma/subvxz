WEBVTT

00:02.698 --> 00:03.873
VIOLET:
And the tips I get at the casino

00:03.916 --> 00:06.832
are fantastic,
especially from old guys.

00:06.876 --> 00:09.444
Lake Tahoe's
full of old guys, so...

00:09.487 --> 00:12.490
You should come, Mom, you would
be a total trophy wife up here.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.927
Yeah, alcoholic waitress

00:14.971 --> 00:17.060
with two kids, some trophy.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.192
Are you dating anybody?

00:18.235 --> 00:19.802
Not really,

00:19.845 --> 00:23.110
I'm mostly concentrating on work
and saving my money.

00:23.153 --> 00:25.851
I was actually thinking
if I put enough aside,

00:25.895 --> 00:27.592
I could move to France
for a year,

00:27.636 --> 00:30.813
learn a new language,
maybe study to become a chef.

00:30.856 --> 00:33.120
Sounds like you're doing
really well.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.773
So well.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.427
Okay, I got to go.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.821
My roommate and I are gonna go
for a jog around the lake

00:38.864 --> 00:42.129
before our shifts start,
so I'll talk to you next week.

00:42.172 --> 00:45.045
Bye, honey.
Bye.

00:46.263 --> 00:47.743
What do you think?

00:47.786 --> 00:49.832
Every word a lie.

00:49.875 --> 00:50.876
I know, right?

00:50.920 --> 00:51.921
A chef?

00:51.964 --> 00:53.009
Jog?

00:53.053 --> 00:54.793
It was hard to keep
a straight face.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.969
So, what do you think
she's really up to?

00:57.013 --> 00:58.232
[knock at door]

00:58.275 --> 00:59.624
No idea, but she didn't
ask for money,

00:59.668 --> 01:01.061
so I couldn't be prouder.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.849
Hey, it's
the whole gang.

01:06.892 --> 01:08.198
Hi, buddy.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.286
Hi.

01:09.330 --> 01:10.896
What's with him?

01:10.940 --> 01:12.594
Oh, we need to talk.

01:12.637 --> 01:14.117
Oh, no.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.466
Are you breaking up with me?

01:17.251 --> 01:18.991
What's going on?

01:19.035 --> 01:21.168
We had an incident.

01:21.211 --> 01:22.299
Let's not overreact.

01:22.343 --> 01:25.128
We caught Roscoe
smoking marijuana.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.129
What?
Oh, no.

01:26.173 --> 01:28.653
Again, let's
not overreact.

01:28.697 --> 01:30.220
It's just a
couple of hits,

01:30.264 --> 01:32.135
he was coughing
like a rookie.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.137
While you were
in the house?

01:34.181 --> 01:37.097
No, no, we were on our way
to my friend's baby shower

01:37.140 --> 01:39.403
when we realized that
Baxter forgot the gift.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.710
It was a box set of
Curious Georgebooks.

01:43.059 --> 01:44.887
Maybe not important, go on.

01:45.931 --> 01:48.108
So, when we walked
back into the house,

01:48.151 --> 01:49.370
I looked through
the French doors

01:49.413 --> 01:52.590
and there he was,
puffing away in the Jacuzzi.

01:52.634 --> 01:56.072
Where the hell did he
learn to smoke and soak?

01:57.247 --> 01:58.248
And where did he get the pot?

01:58.292 --> 02:00.076
He said a friend
at school.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.164
He didn't get it from you?

02:01.208 --> 02:02.252
Of course not.

02:02.296 --> 02:04.298
What do you mean,
"Of course not"?

02:04.341 --> 02:05.212
You smoke all the time.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.996
You're more marijuana than man.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.389
Excuse me, but Baxter

02:09.433 --> 02:10.695
no longer smokes marijuana.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.175
Really?

02:12.219 --> 02:14.351
Yes, really.

02:14.395 --> 02:15.657
Candace stood next to me

02:15.700 --> 02:17.572
while I flushed my whole
stash down the toilet,

02:17.615 --> 02:21.053
longest 45 minutes
of my life.

02:21.097 --> 02:22.185
Are you buying
any of this?

02:22.229 --> 02:23.273
It's true.

02:23.317 --> 02:24.622
We're trying
to get pregnant.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.842
Smoking's bad
for the sperm count

02:26.885 --> 02:29.061
and plus there's
fallopian tube issues...

02:29.105 --> 02:30.280
Baxter!

02:30.324 --> 02:32.413
I didn't say who
had the issues.

02:34.328 --> 02:35.764
This doesn't
make any sense.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.331
He was always
such a happy kid.

02:37.374 --> 02:38.941
Why would he
need to get high?

02:38.984 --> 02:40.072
Really?

02:40.116 --> 02:41.900
Given how he was raised,
you have to ask?

02:42.771 --> 02:44.903
Are you saying this is my fault?

02:44.947 --> 02:48.168
Well... I'm certainly
not a drug addict.

02:50.953 --> 02:53.129
Baxter, you might want
to get her out of here

02:53.173 --> 02:55.175
before I break that
store-bought nose.

02:56.306 --> 02:57.612
Come on, honey.

02:57.655 --> 02:59.266
I had a deviated septum.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.181
Yeah, and you're
gonna have it again!

03:02.269 --> 03:03.618
Chef Violet's looking

03:03.661 --> 03:05.968
pretty good right now,
isn't she?

03:07.056 --> 03:08.971
♪

03:24.900 --> 03:26.075
I thought we were
five years away

03:26.118 --> 03:27.294
from having to
deal with this.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.338
Really? Five?

03:28.382 --> 03:29.470
He still eats cereal

03:29.513 --> 03:31.515
with pirates on the box.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.430
I know, but it's happening now,

03:33.474 --> 03:35.040
so how do you want to handle it?

03:35.084 --> 03:37.347
I don't. I want to pretend
it's not happening.

03:37.391 --> 03:39.480
All right,
then let's sit down and eat.

03:39.523 --> 03:40.916
You're kidding, right?

03:40.959 --> 03:43.353
Well, you know the kid's
probably hungry.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.357
Roscoe, get out here!

03:50.273 --> 03:51.405
Well?

03:51.448 --> 03:53.102
What do you have to say
for yourself?

03:53.145 --> 03:56.148
I thought they'd be gone longer.

03:56.192 --> 03:57.585
You believe this kid?

03:57.628 --> 03:59.500
That was pretty cute.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.632
Sit down.

04:01.676 --> 04:02.981
Let's get this over with.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.287
How much trouble am I in?

04:04.331 --> 04:06.289
Oh, I think you know.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.682
I don't.

04:07.725 --> 04:09.771
Well, that didn't work.

04:09.814 --> 04:11.425
[sighs]

04:11.468 --> 04:13.688
Roscoe, after everything
you've seen me and your grandma

04:13.731 --> 04:15.167
go through,
why would you do this?

04:15.211 --> 04:17.082
I'm sorry,
it was the first time.

04:17.125 --> 04:18.214
I didn't even like it.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.303
Aw, he thinks we're stupid.

04:22.349 --> 04:23.524
If you're gonna lie to us,

04:23.567 --> 04:24.699
you're gonna have to try
a little harder.

04:24.742 --> 04:25.961
I'm not lying.

04:26.004 --> 04:27.571
You get that addiction
runs in our family.

04:27.615 --> 04:29.965
Along with lying.

04:30.008 --> 04:31.967
What do you want from me?
I said I'm sorry.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.664
Where'd you even get the pot?

04:33.708 --> 04:35.318
From a kid at school.What's his name?

04:35.362 --> 04:37.407
I don't want to say.You have to tell us.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.453
Grandma said that
I should never be a snitch.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.324
I said never be a snitch,

04:41.368 --> 04:43.283
unless the DA
offers you immunity.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.417
Mom, I'm never gonna do it
again, I promise.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.899
Okay, well, I want you

04:50.942 --> 04:52.857
to stay away
from this unnamed kid.

04:52.901 --> 04:53.945
I will.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.077
I don't even like him.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.121
Yeah, 'cause everyone hates

04:56.165 --> 04:57.384
the kid who gives away pot.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.430
You need better lies.

05:00.474 --> 05:01.779
But I'm telling the truth.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.433
Enough! Go to your room.

05:11.702 --> 05:12.834
Well, this is a nightmare.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.052
That it is.

05:14.096 --> 05:15.489
I don't know what to do.

05:15.532 --> 05:16.490
Well, we know grounding him

05:16.533 --> 05:17.491
isn't gonna work.

05:17.534 --> 05:18.970
Remember when you grounded me

05:19.014 --> 05:20.058
for smoking weed at his age?

05:20.102 --> 05:21.233
Yeah. Hard to do

05:21.277 --> 05:23.061
when you're living in a car.

05:23.105 --> 05:24.672
You sent me to the backseat

05:24.715 --> 05:26.413
to think about what I'd done.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.632
Okay, but at least now

05:28.676 --> 05:29.981
we're both in recovery

05:30.025 --> 05:31.766
and we have tools
to deal with this.

05:31.809 --> 05:34.159
What are those tools, Mom?

05:35.030 --> 05:36.074
I don't know,

05:36.118 --> 05:37.815
sometimes I just say things.

05:41.558 --> 05:43.821
Well, I am proud
to announce

05:43.865 --> 05:45.388
I now have the
longest sobriety

05:45.432 --> 05:46.607
of anyone in my family,

05:46.650 --> 05:48.478
including my 12-year-old son.

05:49.479 --> 05:50.262
There's something

05:50.306 --> 05:52.003
for the Christmas letter.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.092
Where'd Roscoe
get the pot?

05:54.136 --> 05:55.616
He says from a kid at school,

05:55.659 --> 05:57.269
but I'm still not sure
I believe him.

05:57.313 --> 05:58.706
That's where I got
my first joint.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.403
Alex Marcucci.

06:00.447 --> 06:01.752
He could roll them
with one hand.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.624
What's so special
about that?

06:03.667 --> 06:05.495
He only had one hand.

06:06.888 --> 06:09.804
I just can't believe
this is happening.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.545
He's only in
seventh grade.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.416
Hmm, that's how old I was.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.113
I stole one of my
mother's Valium,

06:15.157 --> 06:16.724
washed it down
with my mother's vodka

06:16.767 --> 06:18.856
and threw up
on my mom's poodle.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.425
Did you get in a lot of trouble?

06:22.469 --> 06:25.472
No, she was so out of it,
she thought she did it.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.563
I smoked my first joint
when I was 14,

06:29.606 --> 06:32.348
but I had already done acid
and mushrooms by then,

06:32.392 --> 06:34.524
so, you know,
weed, whoop-de-do.

06:36.526 --> 06:38.223
Christy, I understand
why you're worried,

06:38.267 --> 06:39.964
but this doesn't mean
Roscoe's going down

06:40.008 --> 06:41.705
the same road as
the rest of us.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.620
It doesn't mean he's not.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.579
Well, the only thing
you can do right now

06:45.622 --> 06:48.059
is make it safe for
him to talk to you.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.018
Hey, don't put this on me!

06:50.061 --> 06:52.237
My son knows he can talk
to me anytime!

06:52.281 --> 06:54.109
I've worked my ass off
to be supportive

06:54.152 --> 06:55.502
and easy to open up to!

06:57.982 --> 07:01.116
And you all thought
I was the crazy one.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.645
You went online,
you read all the reviews,

07:08.689 --> 07:10.473
but here's something
they don't tell you

07:10.517 --> 07:12.170
about Korean cars...

07:12.214 --> 07:14.999
no one'll ever steal it.

07:15.043 --> 07:17.045
Hey, Baxter.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.089
Got a minute?

07:18.133 --> 07:19.090
Not really.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.875
Make a minute.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.485
I'll be right back.

07:22.529 --> 07:25.314
Sit inside and enjoy
how a nation of short people

07:25.357 --> 07:28.448
built a car with surprisingly
ample head room.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.451
In here.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.542
So... what's going on?

07:35.585 --> 07:37.065
What the hell do you
think is going on?!

07:37.108 --> 07:40.677
I'm guessing the pot thing
with Roscoe?

07:40.721 --> 07:42.157
You're guessing?

07:44.812 --> 07:45.856
Okay, I'm locking it in.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.249
That's my final answer.

07:47.292 --> 07:48.380
Look, I didn't want to do this

07:48.424 --> 07:49.643
in front of Candace

07:49.686 --> 07:51.427
'cause, frankly,
I don't want to do anything

07:51.471 --> 07:53.821
in front of Candace,
but you got to level with me.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.649
Christy, it was not my pot.

07:55.692 --> 07:58.216
You do know what "level with me"
means, right?

07:58.260 --> 07:59.522
It means stop lying.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.045
I told you, I stopped smoking

08:01.089 --> 08:02.699
'cause of my low sperm count!

08:11.273 --> 08:13.536
I've known you for 15 years.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.233
The longest you've ever gone
without smoking pot

08:15.277 --> 08:17.148
was when we went to Disney World
with your parents.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.410
Oh, I got high at Disney World.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.021
How do you not get high
at Disney World?

08:20.064 --> 08:21.544
And now I'm supposed to believe

08:21.588 --> 08:22.763
there's no weed in your house?

08:22.806 --> 08:25.592
Yes, because I told you
there isn't.

08:25.635 --> 08:26.636
Look...

08:26.680 --> 08:27.724
I know this is a hot button

08:27.768 --> 08:29.030
for you and it would make

08:29.073 --> 08:30.510
your life a lot easier
if I was the one

08:30.553 --> 08:32.599
that screwed up, but I didn't.

08:35.818 --> 08:37.691
Okay.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.082
I'm sorry.

08:39.126 --> 08:41.129
It's just...

08:41.172 --> 08:42.739
I'm so sad.

08:42.783 --> 08:45.002
Me, too.

08:45.046 --> 08:46.961
But let's remember
Roscoe's a good kid

08:47.004 --> 08:48.745
and he made one mistake.

08:48.789 --> 08:51.792
Yeah, well, I was a good kid
who made one mistake

08:51.835 --> 08:53.576
every day for 24 years.

08:53.620 --> 08:56.710
But you didn't have
a mom like you.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.146
Wow.

08:58.189 --> 09:00.365
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

09:00.409 --> 09:01.715
I've said nicer things,

09:01.758 --> 09:03.673
you were just too
drunk to remember.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.677
So you and Candace are
trying to get pregnant?

09:07.721 --> 09:10.332
Yeah, she's taking hormones,
checking her temperature.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.682
We always have to do it
in a certain position.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.597
My fault, I asked.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.033
See you later.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.905
You think that's bad,
she's having me wear boxers

09:17.948 --> 09:19.602
to keep my balls cool.

09:24.781 --> 09:27.392
Sorry, Janice.

09:30.352 --> 09:32.180
Got enough
chocolate sauce?
Yup.

09:32.223 --> 09:33.834
You want
more sprinkles?
Yup.

09:33.877 --> 09:36.445
Do you know where your dad
hides his pot?
Yup.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.360
Damn it.

09:38.403 --> 09:41.798
So it was your dad's joint
you were smoking?

09:41.842 --> 09:43.191
I guess.

09:43.234 --> 09:44.627
Why'd you cover for him?

09:44.671 --> 09:47.325
I don't know. He's my dad.

09:47.369 --> 09:49.763
That's sweet.
Stupid but sweet.

09:49.806 --> 09:52.113
[door opens]Please don't tell Mom.

09:52.156 --> 09:55.595
Hey, who taught
you never to be a snitch?[door closes]

09:55.638 --> 09:57.771
CHRISTY:
I'm home.
He got the pot
from Baxter!

09:57.814 --> 09:59.511
Hey!

09:59.555 --> 10:03.254
Another lesson--
never trust anybody.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.744
Hi. I'm Christy.
I'm an alcoholic.

10:14.788 --> 10:17.094
ALL:
Hi, Christy.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.880
As you can see,
I brought my son tonight.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.316
[quietly]:
Don't look at him.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.926
He'll know I'm
talking about him.

10:24.319 --> 10:26.843
Normally I'd leave him home

10:26.887 --> 10:28.715
to watch television, but

10:28.758 --> 10:30.673
I just don't trust him
right now.

10:30.717 --> 10:31.979
Hang on.

10:32.022 --> 10:34.546
Oh, look, a Pokémon!

10:34.590 --> 10:36.026
You're good.

10:37.637 --> 10:41.902
Anyway, he got caught smoking
a joint at my ex's house.

10:41.945 --> 10:44.513
12 years old, and
he's smoking pot in a Jacuzzi

10:44.556 --> 10:46.646
like some kind of
itty-bitty rapper.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.648
Don't look at him.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.388
And the worst part is,

10:50.432 --> 10:52.347
he stole the weed
from his father,

10:52.390 --> 10:54.044
who lied to my face
about quitting

10:54.088 --> 10:55.698
because of his pathetic
sperm count.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.657
And yes,

10:57.700 --> 11:00.572
I know I shouldn't be gossiping
about that, but I don't care.

11:00.616 --> 11:04.185
I hope he has to keep banging
that witch upside down forever.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.492
Anyway,

11:07.536 --> 11:10.539
I think
what's really bothering me is

11:10.582 --> 11:13.455
I'm just so scared
that my son's gonna wind up

11:13.498 --> 11:15.587
in one of these rooms one day,

11:15.631 --> 11:18.939
but, you know,
without headphones.

11:18.982 --> 11:21.202
Don't look at him.

11:22.812 --> 11:25.162
I guess that's it.

11:25.206 --> 11:28.513
Thanks for letting me share
the endless turd storm

11:28.557 --> 11:29.863
that is my life.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.302
Okay. Anyone else?

11:34.345 --> 11:36.260
Hi. Bonnie, alcoholic.

11:36.304 --> 11:37.914
ALL:
Hi, Bonnie.

11:37.958 --> 11:41.483
And I, too, know what it's like
to have a child in these rooms.

11:41.526 --> 11:44.616
Don't look at her.

11:47.358 --> 11:49.752
Baxter just pulled up.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.841
Okay, what's the plan?

11:51.885 --> 11:53.277
Simple. I'm gonna kill him,

11:53.321 --> 11:54.931
you're gonna dispose
of the body.

11:54.975 --> 11:57.673
I never get the fun part.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.458
I wish I thought
any of this was fun.

12:00.502 --> 12:02.286
Can be. Have you taken a moment

12:02.330 --> 12:04.941
to consider how much leverage
you have right now?

12:04.985 --> 12:06.334
What are you talking about?

12:06.377 --> 12:09.119
You know that he lied
to his wife.

12:09.163 --> 12:12.427
And you know that without her,
he's jobless, homeless

12:12.470 --> 12:15.909
and back to selling his sperm,
which we now know is worthless.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.346
So with that in mind,

12:18.389 --> 12:21.349
what if you were to suggest that
in exchange for your silence,

12:21.392 --> 12:23.568
he might want to send you
and your mother

12:23.612 --> 12:25.570
to Hawaii for a week
for the low price

12:25.614 --> 12:29.183
of $1,700 per person
courtesy of Travelocity?

12:29.226 --> 12:33.013
Ooh, Kauai,
the garden island.
Mm-hmm.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.015
And look, a complimentary luau

12:35.058 --> 12:36.973
with a pig they cook
in the ground.

12:37.017 --> 12:40.368
Mmm. I've never
eaten a dirty pig.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.937
Yes, I heard it.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.460
So what do you think?

12:45.503 --> 12:49.507
No, this is about
my son's well-being.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.683
Not about seven days
and six nights

12:51.727 --> 12:53.729
at the Sheraton
Poipu Beach.
Mm.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.950
You're a better mother
when you're tan.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.821
[doorbell rings]

12:58.865 --> 13:00.518
No.

13:00.562 --> 13:01.911
Oh, come on!

13:01.955 --> 13:04.479
We can swim with the dolphins!

13:06.263 --> 13:08.613
Hey. Roscoe ready to go?

13:08.657 --> 13:10.877
Hang out a minute.
He's washing my car.

13:10.920 --> 13:11.965
Ah, that's smart.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.662
A little manual labor
as punishment?

13:13.705 --> 13:14.924
Builds character.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.230
Yeah, shut up and sit down.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.798
What?You heard her.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.104
Okay.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.936
Everything all right?

13:26.980 --> 13:29.896
Roscoe told us he
found your stash.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.375
That's impossible.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.595
There is no stash.
I told you I quit.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.946
So you're calling
your son a liar?

13:36.990 --> 13:42.299
I, uh... I guess.

13:42.343 --> 13:44.867
Oh, man up, you
sperm-less weasel!

13:46.086 --> 13:48.001
Tell me the truth.

13:48.044 --> 13:51.221
Okay, it was me!
I'm sorry!

13:51.265 --> 13:53.354
You made me feel
like it was my fault.

13:53.397 --> 13:57.184
Of course I did!
I'm a sperm-less weasel!

13:57.227 --> 14:00.448
All right, now here's
what's gonna happen.

14:04.408 --> 14:07.107
You're gonna call Candace
and tell her the truth.

14:07.150 --> 14:09.283
I can't do that.
She'll throw me out.

14:09.326 --> 14:10.893
Fine, then I'll tell her.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.155
Go ahead.

14:12.199 --> 14:14.549
She's not gonna believe you.
She hates you,

14:14.592 --> 14:19.032
whereas I'm the man
she's settling for.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.729
That might be true.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.600
Let's find out.

14:22.644 --> 14:23.863
Let's.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.560
Unlocking my phone.

14:25.603 --> 14:27.475
Scrolling through contacts.

14:27.518 --> 14:30.695
Selecting "Big
Red Nightmare."

14:33.046 --> 14:35.613
"Mobile."

14:35.657 --> 14:38.399
And it's ringing.Tell her I said hi.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.576
Hi, Candace.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.144
It's Christy...Stop, stop, stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

14:44.187 --> 14:46.581
Just give me a second
to explain.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.322
I know both of you think
that I'm...

14:48.365 --> 14:50.802
[ringtone plays]Oh, my God, she's calling back.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.935
Oh.
Hey!

14:56.199 --> 14:58.941
I'll buy you a new phone!

14:58.985 --> 15:00.247
Look, I am sorry

15:00.290 --> 15:01.944
that I threw you under the bus,

15:01.988 --> 15:04.077
but you have to understand
what my life isnow.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.210
I pretend all day long
to like selling cars,

15:07.254 --> 15:10.126
then go
to my tastefully decorated home

15:10.170 --> 15:12.955
and pretend
to like barbecuing fish.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.175
And if that's not bad enough,

15:15.218 --> 15:18.395
I have to pretend to like
listening to Adele during sex!

15:20.571 --> 15:23.270
I can't do all of that
without pot!

15:24.836 --> 15:26.534
Please don't take it away
from me.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.797
It's the only thing that's real!

15:28.840 --> 15:31.017
Besides the love you have
for your son.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.410
Yeah, of course. That's magical.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.545
Please don't tell her.

15:37.588 --> 15:40.026
I'll do anything, I swear.

15:40.069 --> 15:42.071
Aloha?

15:43.855 --> 15:46.380
Okay, listen up.

15:46.423 --> 15:48.164
You are gonna get your pot out
of the house--

15:48.208 --> 15:49.992
all of it this time.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.994
Then you're gonna put it in
a lock box with a combination,

15:52.038 --> 15:54.692
and then you're gonna send me
a picture of that box.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.346
You got it.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.914
I'll do it tonight when Big
Red's watching Real Housewives.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.874
Is that it? Are we good?

16:02.918 --> 16:05.703
One of us is good. Mom?

16:05.747 --> 16:08.228
Go for it?Go for it.

16:08.271 --> 16:10.273
I'll get my laptop.
Get out your credit card.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.498
Are you in trouble
with Candace?

16:17.541 --> 16:20.153
No more than usual.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.024
Are you in trouble with Mom?

16:22.068 --> 16:24.635
No more than usual.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.595
Are you mad at me?

16:27.638 --> 16:29.684
Are you kidding?
Of course not.

16:29.727 --> 16:32.208
If anything, I should be
apologizing to you.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.167
I'm listening.

16:35.255 --> 16:38.258
Roscoe, you know I smoke pot.

16:38.301 --> 16:39.694
Yeah.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.391
And so, you might think
that's cool

16:41.435 --> 16:43.872
because, you know, I'm cool.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.830
[Roscoe laughs]

16:45.874 --> 16:48.224
Sorry, go on.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.184
But it's not cool.

16:51.227 --> 16:54.274
It's a crutch that people use
when, you know,

16:54.317 --> 16:56.319
they're dealing with feelings
they don't like.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.539
I get it.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.890
Is that why you did it?

17:01.933 --> 17:04.848
No.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.982
So then why?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.114
The truth?

17:08.156 --> 17:09.157
Yeah.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.248
We were out of beer.

17:12.291 --> 17:14.642
[tires squealing]

17:24.478 --> 17:27.002
They really pack you
in here, don't they?

17:27.046 --> 17:30.136
Really, chipmunk?
You feel crammed in?

17:30.179 --> 17:32.138
Oh, sorry.

17:32.181 --> 17:35.750
Hey, I saw Alicia Keys
in first class.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.273
You want to say hello?

17:37.317 --> 17:38.405
Not really, no.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.233
Oh, come on.
She's just sitting there.

17:40.276 --> 17:42.496
I'm sure she'd appreciate
meeting some of her fans.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.063
I'm sure you're wrong.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.455
What's your problem?

17:45.499 --> 17:47.109
We're on a free vacation.

17:47.153 --> 17:50.286
I know. I'm just
thinking about Roscoe.

17:50.330 --> 17:53.159
Look, we got all the drugs
out of that house,

17:53.202 --> 17:54.725
Baxter's gonna watch him
like a hawk.

17:54.769 --> 17:56.292
We've done all we can do.

17:56.336 --> 17:59.121
You're right.
I'll try to relax.

17:59.165 --> 18:03.169
There you go. Let's raise
our cups of warm ginger ale

18:03.212 --> 18:05.649
and toast to seven days,
six nights in paradise

18:05.693 --> 18:07.260
with free breakfast buffet.

18:07.303 --> 18:09.653
Don't forget
the dirty pig.
[laughs]

18:12.134 --> 18:14.441
[sighs]

18:16.225 --> 18:20.186
There's only one thing that bugs
me about this whole Roscoe deal.What?

18:20.229 --> 18:23.363
He said it was the first time
he ever smoked pot.

18:23.406 --> 18:25.800
Now, is a Jacuzzi
the place you go

18:25.843 --> 18:27.323
to get high for the first time,

18:27.367 --> 18:33.112
or is that... optimizing an
experience you've already had?

18:35.375 --> 18:37.159
Turn this plane around!
