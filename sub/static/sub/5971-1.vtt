01:57.000 --> 01:59.500
Did you see it? I think I got it.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.100
That little piggy was fast.

02:02.300 --> 02:06.800
Hey, everybody, this is all of our kill.
We all take credit.

02:07.700 --> 02:10.600
- I got a side ache.
- You hit Enmebaragesi.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.900
I'm pretty sure he had that
when he left the village.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.500
That's not my spear.

02:16.700 --> 02:20.100
My spear has feathers...
Okay, that one's got a feather.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.700
Okay, that is my spear.
I'm sorry, man.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.600
Great. Two spears.
Twice the killing power.

02:26.900 --> 02:30.800
Thanks a lot.
Next time don't block my shot.

02:31.600 --> 02:35.200
What? I didn't say...
Come on, not my fault.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.000
Who stands in front of a boar
on a hunt?

02:45.900 --> 02:47.100
Hey, there you are.

02:47.300 --> 02:50.700
I don't think you wanna be gathered.
You wanna be eaten.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.300
Hi, Marlak.

02:58.200 --> 03:01.500
Well, there won't be any berries
in the fruit salad now, so we all lose.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.200
Hey, Oh. How's it going?

03:03.400 --> 03:05.600
Hunters think they're so cool.
You know, they...

03:05.800 --> 03:09.300
They don't think this is challenging?
Gathering? It's extremely challenging.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.900
You have to find all the fruit with
the least amount of bird shit on it...

03:13.000 --> 03:14.300
...and put it in the basket.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.600
Are they picking on you?

03:15.800 --> 03:18.300
If they're picking on you,
I will straighten them out.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.900
- All right. Yeah, would you?
- You're right.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.400
Let it slide this time.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.600
Next time, though, they will feel the tip
of my short spear.

03:26.400 --> 03:30.100
- What happened to your spear?
- I modified it. Made it a snub nose.

03:30.200 --> 03:34.300
It's lighter. It's a better killing tool.
Anyway...

03:34.700 --> 03:37.800
Oh, there's Maya.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.800
I'll be right back.
Unless something goes horribly right.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.100
- Hello, Maya.
- Hey, Zed.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.800
What do I gotta do
to make you my woman?

03:49.000 --> 03:55.100
Look, you're a special guy.
You've got a lot of personality.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.400
When my parents
were killed by that pack of wild dogs...

03:58.600 --> 04:01.300
...you really helped me
see the funny side.

04:03.100 --> 04:04.900
"No, no! He's got my ankle!"

04:05.900 --> 04:09.300
"Get off." That's your mom.

04:09.500 --> 04:14.600
So, yeah, you make me laugh,
but that's not enough.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.399
I'm an old-fashioned kind of girl.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.500
I need a man who can protect me
and take care of me.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.200
What do you mean?
Like Marlak?

04:21.399 --> 04:24.100
Well, I mean, he is the best hunter
in the village.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.100
- Debatable.
- People voted.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.300
Maybe I'm not the greatest hunter.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.900
- Or gatherer.
- Yes. Or gatherer.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.500
Zed, those are the only two jobs
that we have here.

04:33.700 --> 04:36.500
I can take care of you.
Does it look like I'm starving?

04:36.700 --> 04:40.400
Come on.
Tell me you can say no to this.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.800
Give it a second. Let it work on you.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.200
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely can say no to that.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.400
Maya. Can I see you later?

04:52.600 --> 04:54.300
I think I have to wash my hair.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.700
You washed your hair last year.

05:03.900 --> 05:05.700
Tonight, we feast.

05:09.700 --> 05:12.200
Maya. For you.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.900
Thanks, Marlak.
Another severed boar's head.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.200
- It's a different color.
- Yeah, this one is...

05:18.300 --> 05:21.600
- Left the tongue in.
- Yeah, this is really nice, Marlak.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.700
Look at Marlak flirting with Maya.
He doesn't know her at all.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.800
Head's not even the best part
of the boar.

05:27.900 --> 05:32.700
It's the back fat, stupid.
Muscleheaded idiot.

05:32.900 --> 05:37.200
Hi, Eema. Hi, Eema. Hi, Eema.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.100
Yeah. She doesn't even know I exist.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.000
There's like 60 people
in the village. I mean...

05:44.200 --> 05:47.300
...you have to go out of your way
to not know that somebody exists.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.500
I just wanna lay with her so badly.

05:49.700 --> 05:53.000
I don't see it. She's cute,
but I don't think I'd lay with her.

05:53.100 --> 05:56.200
She's your sister. I mean,
that'd be like laying with your mother.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.300
Which was a big mistake.
I see that now.

05:59.500 --> 06:04.000
You think it's not gonna be awkward
in the morning, but... Trust me, wow.

06:04.100 --> 06:04.600
Listen, you wanna impress Eema?
Do the fertility dance with her...

06:04.600 --> 06:07.800
Listen, you wanna impress Eema?
Do the fertility dance with her...

06:08.000 --> 06:11.300
...at the feast tonight
then drag her back to your hut.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.100
My hut's a mess right now,
and what if she struggles?

06:14.300 --> 06:17.000
You give her a little tap on the head.
Women respond to that.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.000
I still live with my parents.

06:19.200 --> 06:22.100
I don't wanna keep them up all night
with my raucous lovemaking.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.900
I'd get an earful in the morning.
She only likes hunters.

06:25.100 --> 06:28.100
She doesn't like gatherers.
She's a gatherer herself is the irony.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.800
She's a self-loathing gatherer.

06:33.900 --> 06:36.200
- That's pretty suggestive.
- I wouldn't read too much into that.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.200
Okay, now she's just asking
for some splinters.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.800
Hey, hey... Squanto.
Give me a break, would you?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.200
You got the whole forest.

06:46.400 --> 06:49.500
Why does everybody always have
to take a crap right behind my hut?

06:49.700 --> 06:53.800
I could be wrong, I think what it is
is that all the poop in the area...

06:54.000 --> 06:58.300
...fertilizes the ground and it gives
the leaves a softer feel for wiping.

06:58.500 --> 07:02.900
It's not that nobody respects you.
I haven't heard that from everyone.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.700
I've had it. Let's go.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.100
Where are we going?
We're not supposed to go this far.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.700
I'm sick of the whole village
treating me like a joke.

07:10.900 --> 07:13.200
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- Change villages.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.100
No. I'm gonna change my head.

07:16.700 --> 07:19.700
I don't think that's possible.
Your head is attached to your body.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.600
Not the whole head.
I mean, my mind.

07:22.800 --> 07:23.900
Mind...

07:24.100 --> 07:26.700
Don't tell me you're thinking
about eating forbidden fruit.

07:26.900 --> 07:29.400
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.600
Zed, that's the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.100
You don't eat from that one.
It's forbidden.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.500
But why is it forbidden?

07:36.700 --> 07:38.600
What is it they don't want us
to have?

07:38.800 --> 07:42.200
It's not the fruit. It's about the rule.
It's about doing what you're told.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.800
We've been doing what we were told
our entire lives.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.500
- How's that worked out?
- I like doing what I'm told.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.000
It gives my day
some much-needed structure. Wait.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.900
Zed. Stop.
It's just a piece of fruit.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.100
Eating a fruit
is not gonna change your life.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.100
What if it's magic fruit?

07:56.200 --> 08:00.100
What if this makes me the smartest
man the village has ever known?

08:00.200 --> 08:01.600
That's a pretty low bar.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.100
Then all the hunters
would have to bow down to me.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.800
Maya would lay with me like that.

08:05.900 --> 08:07.900
That's what this is about?
Laying with Maya?

08:08.100 --> 08:10.700
I have a great destiny,
I'm about to find out what it is.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.000
Put the fruit down.
What if somebody sees us?

08:13.100 --> 08:16.000
They'll peel our skin off
and tie us to an anthill.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.500
Now you've done it.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.700
It's got sort of a knowledge-y taste.

08:23.900 --> 08:26.800
Does it have a sort of forbidden taste?
That's what it is.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
- Oh, I definitely feel something.
- What?

08:30.200 --> 08:34.799
Less hungry, for one,
but also more intelligenter.

08:35.299 --> 08:38.100
It's like
I feel like maybe I know everything.

08:39.299 --> 08:43.400
Ask me something. Anything. Go.
Test me. Go.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.800
All right, where does the sun go
at night?

08:46.800 --> 08:48.100
Pass. Next question.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.600
- Okay, where do babies come from?
- Pass. Next question.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.000
- There's a snake on my foot.
- In the form of a question.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.000
There's a snake on my foot?

08:59.900 --> 09:01.800
- Correct.
- What do I do?

09:01.900 --> 09:06.100
I got a lot of ideas. I'm bursting
with ideas on the subject.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.800
- It's constricting me.
- You could stick your finger in its hole.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.800
You know what, you could eat it
before it eats you. Try that.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.600
Eat the snake first.
That's what my new brain tells me.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.900
- It's preparing to eat me.
- Go for the eyes.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.000
It's big.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.400
Zed, please help me.

09:25.700 --> 09:26.900
I'm dying a virgin.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.400
Wait right here.
I'm gonna go eat more fruit.

09:42.700 --> 09:47.000
- This was a bit of a rough day for me.
- Yeah. There's gotta be more to life.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.200
This is a lot. I don't think I can handle
too much more than this.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.500
No way. Look at these people.

09:52.600 --> 09:56.100
They're like animals.
We're way too good for this.

09:56.300 --> 09:58.700
Now that I'm smarter
I'm going straight to the top.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.100
I'm bringing you.
You're gonna be my right hand.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.600
I've seen what you do
with your right hand. No.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.500
Don't you wonder what's on
the other side of the mountains?

10:06.700 --> 10:09.300
There's nothing on the other side
of the mountains, okay?

10:09.500 --> 10:12.700
The world ends. Everybody
knows that. You'd fall right off of it.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.100
But what if it doesn't?

10:14.300 --> 10:17.000
It makes my stomach go:

10:17.800 --> 10:20.500
I've been thinking a lot
ever since I ate that fruit.

10:20.700 --> 10:23.100
Why is there fruit? What is fruit?

10:23.400 --> 10:26.400
It's a thing that you eat.
Why do we eat?

10:26.500 --> 10:30.000
What are we? What are we?
Why do I have these?

10:30.200 --> 10:32.100
Everything is weird.

10:32.300 --> 10:35.900
When you really stop and look at it,
everything gets very, very strange...

10:36.000 --> 10:37.500
Why am I talking? What is this?

10:37.700 --> 10:39.900
My lips make a movement
and then a sound...

10:40.100 --> 10:42.000
...and you know what I mean.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.000
Blows my mind.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.100
That just sounds like crazy fruit talk.
I don't wanna hear it right now.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.300
Boy, she looks nice tonight.

10:51.600 --> 10:55.200
Do it, man. Dance for her.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.500
I don't know.
They're doing the jackal dance.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.100
It's not my strongest.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.600
What, are you kidding me?
You have an amazing jackal dance.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.800
Go. Jackal dance.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.100
Get into it.

11:35.100 --> 11:36.300
<i>Over the head.</i>

11:53.800 --> 11:57.400
I'm gonna go and eat.
I'm gonna come back.

11:58.800 --> 12:04.500
Your father was a great hunter.
But you, you're like a little girl.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Good one, Marlak.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.300
Enmebaragesi says
he saw you in the garden.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.700
Really? Well, what if I told you
that Enmebaragesi was a liar?

12:14.900 --> 12:17.400
I saw him eat the forbidden fruit.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.100
Oh, that.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.500
- Hey, what's going on here?
- I will kill you where you stand.

12:25.700 --> 12:28.500
Oh, a shooting star. That's the best.

12:40.500 --> 12:44.500
- You really ate the fruit?
- One bite. What's the big deal?

12:44.700 --> 12:46.900
You don't eat the fruit.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.500
It's the number one rule
since the beginning of time.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.800
Since the Great Turtle climbed out
of the sea with Earth on its back.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.900
I know, but I'm a little fuzzy
on the exact details.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.600
Forbidden. Forbidden fruit.

12:58.800 --> 13:04.500
You ate... You did the one thing
you're not supposed to do. Forbidden.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.500
But the word "forbidden" implies
there's a little wiggle room.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.800
There's no wiggle room
with forbidden. You're cursed, man.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.300
If you stay here, we'll all be cursed.
You have to leave.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.100
- Where am I supposed to go?
- I didn't eat the fruit.

13:19.300 --> 13:20.300
My hands are tied.

13:20.500 --> 13:24.000
I know I'm being a dick right now, man,
but I'm just trying to help you.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.500
Do I detect a little bit of jealousy
because I now have...

13:26.700 --> 13:29.000
...the knowledge of good and evil
and you don't?

13:29.200 --> 13:32.200
You think it's easy being the shaman
of the village?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.400
You think I like putting on
a boar's head every morning?

13:34.600 --> 13:36.400
Putting a bone through my face?

13:36.500 --> 13:39.700
I know we've known each other for
a long time. We throw the rock around.

13:39.900 --> 13:43.500
We have fun together, man,
but I can't be...

13:43.600 --> 13:44.900
You know what I mean?

13:45.100 --> 13:49.200
Plus, wanna know something?
I am high as shit right now, dude.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.800
I just licked like three toads.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.100
I've been up for like 27 suns up
and suns downs.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.200
- Okay.
- I just wanna get a meal...

13:57.400 --> 14:00.100
...I wanna take a fucking nap.
- This is bullshit.

14:00.600 --> 14:04.000
You really... You fucked the pooch
on this one.

14:04.300 --> 14:06.700
- Hard.
- I say what I did...

14:06.800 --> 14:08.000
...was a good thing.
- Oh, yeah?

14:08.200 --> 14:10.900
Yeah. Really, really very good thing.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.600
And I should know because I have
the knowledge of good and evil.

14:13.700 --> 14:15.100
- Oh, okay.
- So I ought to know...

14:15.300 --> 14:18.900
...when I know what I'm saying
is what I know what I'm saying.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
- Good.
- And I'm not leaving.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.900
You better get out of here.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.500
Okay, but before I go,
I just wanna say one thing.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.200
I know I'm not the greatest hunter.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.900
- Or gatherer.
- Or gatherer. Thank you.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.700
But there's gotta be more to life
than this.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.700
I'm going, but because I choose to.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.300
And anyone who wants to join me
is welcome.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.600
I don't know where we're going,
but I will lead us.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.900
Yeah, light up the darkness.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.900
So who's with me?

14:58.900 --> 15:00.500
Anyone?

15:01.700 --> 15:04.300
Anyone named Oh?

15:05.300 --> 15:08.300
Okay. Looks like
I'm gonna be going it alone.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.900
Which is fine with me.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.500
Better, in fact...

15:11.700 --> 15:14.500
...because having a partner
would just probably slow me down.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.700
I'm gonna start a new tribe,
10 times better.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.200
There's gonna be 10 times
more dancing and fun.

15:19.400 --> 15:25.400
It's gonna be called Muscle Tribe
of Danger and Excellence.

15:25.500 --> 15:29.500
And you're not invited. I don't even like
any of you guys. I never did.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.700
Unless anyone changes their mind.
Does anyone wanna come?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.200
- We're good.
- Fine. Good. Bye-bye.

15:38.300 --> 15:41.000
Don't... Nobody panic.

15:47.400 --> 15:52.300
No! That's... That's...
Oh, it's not my house.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.300
I see you.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.600
Go away, Marlak.

16:28.800 --> 16:32.800
- Really, animal noises?
- Badger.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.200
This is just insulting.
It's time I killed you.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.800
Fine. But then, tell me this:
Who's that behind you?

16:39.900 --> 16:43.600
You think I'm gonna turn around?
I'm gonna gut you like a pig.

16:50.500 --> 16:54.200
Nice whack on the head.
You should try hitting Eema that hard.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.800
We can discuss that later.
We should run away.

16:56.900 --> 16:59.100
Yes, yes, of course.

17:01.300 --> 17:04.500
So you decided to come after all.
Was it the speech?

17:04.599 --> 17:07.800
- It was the fire. I lost everything.
- Yeah.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.400
I wish we didn't have to leave.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.300
Probably never gonna see
Eema again.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.700
That's not true. We'll go back.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.599
Those hunters are idiots.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.000
They're gonna forget the whole thing
in an hour.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.599
Will you get real, man?
There's no going back, okay?

17:21.800 --> 17:24.300
There's nothing to go back to.
It's just ashes.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.700
Like it's hard to build
one of those huts.

17:26.900 --> 17:28.600
It's just a pile of sticks and dung.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.600
Well, you're a pile of sticks
and dung.

17:30.600 --> 17:31.400
Well, you're a pile of sticks
and dung.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.700
- I'm sorry, l...
- It's okay.

17:34.900 --> 17:37.300
- I don't mean that, obviously.
- I know you're mad...

17:37.500 --> 17:39.700
...but this is a great
opportunity for us.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.000
They didn't appreciate you
back there.

17:42.100 --> 17:45.300
You're the genius who thought up
drinking water from a gourd.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.300
They were all drinking from their
hands.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.200
Well, it just seems practical.
I mean, I don't know.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.600
We have an incredible destiny.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.300
You don't even know where we are.
We're lost.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.700
Of course I know where we are.

18:01.700 --> 18:06.600
It's a cougar.
Don't move a muscle.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.400
- What do we do?
- Don't move your lips.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.400
Rule number one: Show no fear.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.800
You're showing fear.

18:15.900 --> 18:19.000
Much better. Very good.

18:19.100 --> 18:22.100
- Now what?
- There's two opinions on this one.

18:22.300 --> 18:26.400
Some say run,
others say stay perfectly still.

18:26.600 --> 18:32.000
- Which one are you gonna do?
- I'm going to run!

18:50.800 --> 18:52.900
You should put some maggots
on those scratches.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.500
They look pretty deep.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.600
They are very deep.
That's why they appear that way.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.200
- You're still mad at me, aren't you?
- I wish I hadn't come.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.800
Maybe you shouldn't have come...

19:03.000 --> 19:05.700
...if you're gonna keep whining
about every little cougar...

19:05.900 --> 19:07.500
...that attacks you.

19:09.400 --> 19:13.100
Oh, what does this look like?

19:15.100 --> 19:16.400
You making your own fire?

19:16.500 --> 19:18.900
No, I'm making arrows.
We're gonna need them.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.300
- You still coming?
- Yeah.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.900
Yeah!

19:27.200 --> 19:30.600
Yeah. You're my buddy. Yeah.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.500
You're saying we're gonna walk...

19:32.600 --> 19:35.700
...and eventually we're gonna get
to a spot where the world ends...

19:35.900 --> 19:38.900
...and it's like... What is it?
What are we looking at?

19:39.100 --> 19:42.500
First of all, why are you talking to me
in that tone like I'm an idiot?

19:42.700 --> 19:44.300
This is general knowledge.

19:54.100 --> 19:57.600
- I knew it!
- This is incredible.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.700
You still think the world just ends?

19:59.800 --> 20:02.700
Come on, admit it. The fruit man
has the knowledge.

20:02.900 --> 20:05.000
Whoa, whoa, be careful.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.400
Did you learn a lot when you ate
the fruit?

20:10.600 --> 20:13.600
Yeah. I can see, like, 10 minutes
into the future now.

20:13.800 --> 20:17.100
- So what am I doing in ten minutes?
- You're having sex with a zebra.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.800
- That's not funny.
- I'm not joking.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.100
Hope you're ready to bone some zeeb.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.000
People. More than one.

20:26.200 --> 20:29.400
Walking that way.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.000
You think? There's about
a thousand footprints there.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.400
- I mean, it's kind of obvious.
- Oh, yes.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.700
- They stopped here to poop. Look.
- No, I don't want to.

20:38.900 --> 20:42.200
Two men, maybe three. A child.
Or a small woman, maybe.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.200
What are you doing?
You don't know where that's been.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.500
- I know where it's been.
- Don't touch it.

20:47.700 --> 20:49.700
You don't know if a squirrel
has peed on it.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.700
Still warm.
Almost hot in the center.

20:53.100 --> 20:57.100
Looks like they had some nuts.
Apples, maybe.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.300
What are you doing?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.800
- Yep, apples.
- What difference does it make?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.800
That doesn't help us to know that.

21:05.200 --> 21:09.000
You can tell if they ate some shit.
There's a lot of shit in that shit.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.600
My mistake, this is bear poop.

21:12.300 --> 21:13.600
What's that, though?

21:21.600 --> 21:23.700
This one's mine.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.200
Tonight, we feast.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.600
We're gonna need
some arrowheads.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.600
This is where you die!

21:54.400 --> 21:55.900
Easy, easy.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.300
He won't get far.

21:59.300 --> 22:03.200
- Did you shoot my cow?
- Oh, no.

22:03.700 --> 22:06.900
Yes. Well, we're hunters.

22:07.100 --> 22:08.700
Well, he's a hunter. I'm a maker.

22:08.900 --> 22:13.800
- A maker?
- I made this loincloth. I make arrows.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.400
I've made a shelf unit for my hut.

22:16.800 --> 22:20.600
I welcome us to you.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.500
- What do you do?
- What does it look like?

22:23.700 --> 22:26.300
- We're farmers.
- Well, he's a farmer, I'm a herdsman.

22:26.500 --> 22:27.900
You're a suck is what you are.

22:28.100 --> 22:31.400
- My brother Cain. I'm called Abel.
- You are called "suck."

22:31.600 --> 22:34.100
There you go with that "suck."
What does that mean?

22:34.300 --> 22:36.900
Short for "suckle."
Short for "suckle up."

22:37.100 --> 22:40.900
You're suckling up to God.
You're a suckle-up.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
Somebody's upset because God
looked on my sacrifice with favor.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.800
"God looked upon my sacrifice
with favor." I mean...

22:47.000 --> 22:48.400
- Is he a total suck or what?
- Hard to say. We just met.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.500
- Is he a total suck or what?
- Hard to say. We just met.

22:49.700 --> 22:51.500
Why are you bringing these guys
in it?

22:51.600 --> 22:53.300
- They live in a tree.
- Oh, see?

22:53.500 --> 22:56.900
I mean, come on. You just gotta be
so superior to everyone else.

22:57.100 --> 22:59.500
No, but superior to... Than you.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.500
Superior... Let's see how superior
you are when I kick your ass.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.500
- Oh, yeah?
- You want some of that?

23:04.700 --> 23:06.300
- Yes, I do.
- Guys.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.600
- I'm right here. I'm right here.
- No, come on.

23:09.800 --> 23:14.000
No. This smug asshole insulted you,
and I want him to take it back.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.500
- We're not that insulted.
- Why don't you make me?

23:16.600 --> 23:19.400
No, no. Boys, boys.
You are brothers. Let's just relax...

23:19.600 --> 23:22.200
...and let's all just get
some perspective...

23:22.700 --> 23:26.000
Yeah. Yeah. That's how we do it.
That's how we do it. That's...

23:26.100 --> 23:28.600
- There are rules that we abide by.
- Yeah, right.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.700
- Should we do something?
- Just let them settle it.

23:34.900 --> 23:36.700
I tripped.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.400
Well, I guess that settles it.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.800
- What?
- Nothing.

23:47.100 --> 23:52.600
It's... He's all right.
He's just... He's resting.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.700
Well, he's tuckered out
from the fight.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's... You know what?

23:58.100 --> 24:00.600
Let's cover him up with a little dirt
and some straw...

24:00.800 --> 24:03.200
...to keep him warm
until he wakes up and...

24:03.400 --> 24:07.300
Hey. Abel, what are you doing
with my foot? Playing possum?

24:08.200 --> 24:11.700
Hey. Oh, hey, stop it.
He's choking me.

24:12.700 --> 24:16.100
Stop it, Abel. Are you trying
to choke me to death, Abel?

24:16.300 --> 24:18.700
"Yes, Cain, I am."
Come on, stop it!

24:18.900 --> 24:22.800
Self-defense. Clearly. Self-defense.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.500
What have I done?
What have I done?

24:34.900 --> 24:38.400
What have I done again?
What have I done some more?

24:50.400 --> 24:52.300
What have I continued to do?

24:53.100 --> 24:55.800
Oh, guys.
Guys, we're in some real trouble here.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.600
What do you mean, "we"?

24:57.800 --> 25:00.200
I don't wanna play the blame game
but you hit him.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.800
No, no, no. There's two of you
and there's one of me.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
- You could have stopped me.
- Didn't know you were gonna kill him.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.400
- Are you calling me a murderer?
- Did I say that?

25:09.600 --> 25:12.700
It was an accident. Right?

25:12.800 --> 25:15.100
Yeah, you were holding a rock...

25:15.300 --> 25:17.600
...and he ran into it
with his face repeatedly...

25:17.800 --> 25:20.300
...until he just couldn't pull through.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.300
- It was horseplay.
- It was horseplay.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.300
It was two horses playing.

25:24.500 --> 25:27.300
One murders the other one...

25:29.400 --> 25:33.100
Yeah. It's probably best if we
didn't mention this accident to anyone.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.800
Because, you know,
people don't understand, and...

25:36.000 --> 25:37.100
Who am I gonna tell?

25:37.300 --> 25:39.300
I can't think of one
who'd be interested.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.700
I'd only tell him
and he's a witness as well.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.000
- Why even bring it up?
- Okay.

25:44.100 --> 25:47.000
- It's like he killed himself.
- Cry for help, if anything.

25:47.300 --> 25:49.800
All right. Good.

25:51.200 --> 25:55.600
I like you guys. I do.
I like you guys a lot. I do.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.000
Why don't you come over
to my place for supper?

25:58.200 --> 26:01.200
- We already have dinner plans.
- Damn.

26:01.400 --> 26:04.200
Why don't you come over
to my place for supper?

26:04.300 --> 26:06.400
We'll come over to your place
for supper.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.900
I mean, how many times
do we see you?

26:09.300 --> 26:11.400
- Just don't kill me.
- No horseplay.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.400
- What?
- Nothing.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.700
What are these big,
round things for?

26:17.900 --> 26:20.500
They're wheels, numbskull.
They make the cart roll.

26:36.900 --> 26:39.100
I feel like a bird.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.100
Bring it forth.

26:54.300 --> 26:56.300
Hello.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.500
I'm gonna yak.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.500
Hey. What's wrong with you?

27:07.700 --> 27:10.900
- Let me get your hair.
- That was too fast.

27:21.800 --> 27:25.900
Cain, I ask you again,
where is thy brother Abel?

27:26.100 --> 27:29.100
I don't know.
I haven't really seen him at all.

27:29.300 --> 27:33.500
Have you... You guys...
You guys haven't seen him, have you?

27:33.700 --> 27:35.700
- Don't know who that is.
- I don't... Never...

27:35.900 --> 27:38.800
- Don't know who you're talking about.
- What's his name?

27:38.900 --> 27:42.400
- Sure he's out there somewhere...
- I haven't seen anybody anywhere.

27:42.600 --> 27:45.600
Never had the pleasure.
Sure he's in the prime of his life.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.200
This is good soup. Really good.

27:49.400 --> 27:51.700
Lilith said she saw you
in the field with him.

27:51.900 --> 27:54.500
Oh, man, this bread is good.

27:55.100 --> 27:59.600
Oh, really? That... Oh, yeah.
No, that was yesterday, right.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.200
No, this day.
She said you both made offerings.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.000
- Oh, that was Boaz. Yeah.
- No.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.900
- Japheth. It was Japheth.
- No.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.500
- Enoch.
- No.

28:08.600 --> 28:10.100
- I'm sure it was Gilgamesh.
- No.

28:10.300 --> 28:11.700
- Ishmael.
- No.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.100
- Ezidia?
- No.

28:13.200 --> 28:14.500
- Jennifer?
- No.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.800
Now I'm remembering correctly.
It was Tishbaven.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.500
It was you. She said
it looked like you were arguing.

28:19.600 --> 28:24.900
Yeah, well, let's be honest.
Lilith is a lying bitch.

28:25.100 --> 28:28.400
Look, I mean, we're brothers.
We're gonna argue, it's human nature.

28:28.600 --> 28:31.700
- Show me the perfect family.
- His flock goes untended in the field.

28:31.900 --> 28:32.700
Okay, look. Enough.
Am I his keeper?

28:32.700 --> 28:34.300
Okay, look. Enough.
Am I his keeper?

28:34.500 --> 28:37.500
I mean, just get off my back, Father.

28:37.700 --> 28:42.100
I wish you were dead too.
Even though Abel's not dead at all.

28:42.400 --> 28:46.000
I fear the worst for Abel.
I'm sorely vexed.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.100
You're welcome to spend this night
with us.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.100
You may lay with my daughter Lilith.

28:52.500 --> 28:53.800
She is without a husband...

28:54.000 --> 28:56.500
...and as the Lord said,
"Be fruitful and multiply."

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
What about me?

28:59.200 --> 29:01.400
You may share the bed
of my son Seth.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.600
- Thanks, Papa.
- Yeah, there you go.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.700
I multiplied with sheep.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.400
Smell that.

29:09.700 --> 29:11.700
Hello.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.200
Feeling fruitful?

29:16.400 --> 29:20.900
My bed is small but you're welcome
to share it. It's the way of my people.

29:21.100 --> 29:23.300
That is such a good way to be.

29:25.900 --> 29:30.700
In fact, I'm kind of surprised a pretty
girl like you is sleeping alone, anyway.

29:30.900 --> 29:33.300
I'd have thought
guys would be lined up at the door.

29:33.500 --> 29:37.700
- Oh. I don't like men.
- Maybe...

29:37.900 --> 29:40.600
...you just ain't met the right one yet.

29:43.100 --> 29:45.300
Loincloth rising.

29:51.600 --> 29:55.900
- No, I like girls.
- We have that in common.

29:56.100 --> 29:58.800
No, I'm attracted to women.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.800
I don't even know what that means.

30:07.900 --> 30:12.600
- What does that mean?
- I like to have sex with other women.

30:13.200 --> 30:16.700
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
All my brain blood was in my boner.

30:22.300 --> 30:24.600
That was such a good one.

30:24.700 --> 30:26.200
Okay, here we go. Ready, ready?

30:28.300 --> 30:29.900
No, wait.

30:38.700 --> 30:41.100
Little surprise on the end
of that one, right?

30:41.200 --> 30:43.400
- Very good.
- One more, ready?

30:46.400 --> 30:49.900
No, we're good.
Oh, do you wanna see a trick?

30:51.000 --> 30:52.600
Do I have to?

30:55.000 --> 30:57.400
Your brother Seth
is an interesting guy.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.200
Did you know he can put
his own penis in his mouth?

31:00.400 --> 31:01.800
I did not know that.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.200
Whole thing. Right in there.

31:04.500 --> 31:06.800
It's been a great sleepover...

31:07.000 --> 31:10.900
...and thank you
for the gruel and the garb.

31:12.500 --> 31:15.100
- Where's everybody going?
- To look for thy brother Abel.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.300
- Good luck.
- What?

31:17.400 --> 31:20.500
I said, good luck, Father.
I'm really worried about him.

31:20.700 --> 31:21.800
You're not coming?

31:22.000 --> 31:25.100
I'm just gonna stay here
and finish toiling...

31:27.100 --> 31:28.900
...and then we'll be right behind you.
- Good.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.900
Hey, I'm heading to the coast.
You guys should come with me.

31:35.100 --> 31:38.300
They're gonna try to blame this
whole Abel-killing business on you.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.600
- Why blame it on us?
- When they find him...

31:40.800 --> 31:44.400
...and see his head, they're gonna
start pointing fingers. You're drifters.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.400
They're gonna put two
and two together.

31:46.500 --> 31:49.700
Now stop asking so many questions
and let's go. Go, go, go.

31:58.600 --> 32:02.300
Cain. After him.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.900
- They're gaining on us.
- They're getting away.

32:12.100 --> 32:15.900
- Eat my dust, Father.
- This is really too fast.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.200
- Oh, no, no.
- Hold tight. Hold tight.

32:18.400 --> 32:22.400
Cain! My justice will be swift.

32:24.100 --> 32:27.800
No. No! Damn you, Cain.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.400
Who's in God's favor now, Father?

32:37.600 --> 32:41.500
What are the odds of that?
Hey, am I lucky or what?

32:41.700 --> 32:42.700
Your head's smoking.

32:43.800 --> 32:46.500
Hey, it didn't leave a mark, did it?

32:46.600 --> 32:50.400
Just a pink, red hole.

32:50.600 --> 32:53.900
- Your bangs are gonna cover it.
- All right. Whatever.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.500
This is the biggest place
I've ever seen.

32:59.700 --> 33:02.900
It's called a town. Just act normal.

33:03.300 --> 33:06.200
- Hi.
- Hello. Greetings, seafarer.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.800
- That's not normal.
- Hello.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.400
Would you stop saying
hi to everybody? It's annoying.

33:10.600 --> 33:14.000
All right, this is a market.
Over there is a Build-A-Bear.

33:14.500 --> 33:18.700
That's a really good container store.
Oh, this place has killer hemp.

33:19.600 --> 33:23.700
- Yes, please.
- Next up is an unusual item.

33:25.700 --> 33:28.700
- He's big. He's strong.
- It's Marlak.

33:29.500 --> 33:32.200
Oh, do not worry. He is not fighting,
he is having fun.

33:34.300 --> 33:36.700
Okay, maybe he's
little bit depressed.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.500
Maya and Eema.

33:41.700 --> 33:43.700
- Zed.
- Eema.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.600
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi. Gosh.

33:46.800 --> 33:49.000
What happened?
How did you get here?

33:49.100 --> 33:52.300
After the fire that you started,
the hill tribes raided the village.

33:52.500 --> 33:53.600
They held us captive...

33:53.700 --> 33:56.800
...and traded us to the boat people,
who brought us here.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.200
So it's such a coincidence
to run into you guys like this here.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.800
- You think it's a coincidence?
- What do you think?

34:02.900 --> 34:07.700
I'm not sure, but I'm beginning to think
that everything happens for a reason.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.500
God wanted me to have
knowledge of good and evil.

34:11.699 --> 34:14.500
- Why would he want that?
- Why are we assuming God's a he?

34:17.300 --> 34:19.900
I don't know what to say to that.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.500
You kidding?

34:23.500 --> 34:26.000
Anyway, don't you guys see
what I'm saying?

34:26.100 --> 34:27.199
Why would he choose you?

34:27.400 --> 34:29.500
Why wouldn't he choose
someone stronger?

34:29.600 --> 34:32.300
Chosen doesn't have to be strong.
I'm big like this.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.699
- You have a fat face.
- My brain. It's enormous.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.000
I'm smarter than you are.
I don't talk as much.

34:37.199 --> 34:38.900
I'm the smartest guy in the village.

34:39.100 --> 34:41.199
I'm the smartest guy
that was in the village.

34:41.300 --> 34:44.000
Excuse me,
you are interested in some slaves?

34:44.800 --> 34:46.000
Yes.

34:46.100 --> 34:49.800
- This one looks pretty good.
- And her little friend. Very good.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.500
- Just how I like them.
- Hey.

34:51.699 --> 34:53.100
Feisty.

34:53.199 --> 34:55.300
So how do we do this
if we want them?

34:57.700 --> 34:59.000
You have money?

34:59.100 --> 35:00.900
That depends
on what you mean by money.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.900
Excuse me.
Perhaps I could be of some help here.

35:04.400 --> 35:08.000
You guys, let me deal with this guy,
see if I can work out a deal.

35:08.100 --> 35:10.100
What happened to your forehead?

35:10.300 --> 35:13.900
I didn't murder my brother. I didn't.

35:14.100 --> 35:15.600
All right, I'm just gonna...

35:15.800 --> 35:17.900
We're gonna get you out of this.
You trust me?

35:18.600 --> 35:22.900
- I want to trust you.
- Fair enough.

35:26.100 --> 35:30.100
Next up is a twofer.
It is two for price of one.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.700
Have a great vacation.

35:32.900 --> 35:34.400
Never trusted that guy.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.700
Because he murdered his brother
with a rock?

35:36.800 --> 35:40.200
Is that why you didn't trust him?
You got great instincts.

35:50.900 --> 35:53.500
Sorry, do you think you could move
your hands, please?

35:53.700 --> 35:55.300
Yeah.

35:57.100 --> 35:58.900
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

35:59.100 --> 36:03.500
Enmebaragesi, can you move that way
a little bit? We're crowded back here.

36:03.700 --> 36:06.300
Oh, yeah, no problem.
How's that?

36:06.500 --> 36:09.500
Look, I want you to know...

36:09.700 --> 36:12.500
...I blame myself for everything
that's happened.

36:12.700 --> 36:17.200
- Yeah. So does everybody else.
- Stay away from my woman.

36:18.300 --> 36:20.600
Not gonna be possible, Marlak.

36:20.900 --> 36:24.600
She's not your woman.
You can't own people.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.800
Except for the guy who bought
all of us. Apparently, he can.

36:27.900 --> 36:29.100
- That's it.
- What?

36:29.300 --> 36:31.200
- I'm gonna kill you!
- "I'm gonna kill you."

36:31.400 --> 36:34.200
You always say, "I'm gonna kill you"
and you never do.

36:37.700 --> 36:40.100
Be still. Don't make me come in there.

36:40.300 --> 36:42.700
I'd like to see you try.

37:00.700 --> 37:01.900
Take the slaves!

37:03.300 --> 37:04.700
Go!

37:08.700 --> 37:11.600
Eema, run like a cougar
is chasing you.

37:12.100 --> 37:14.700
- Zed!
- Eema.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.200
Come here, you two.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.700
Go, go, go, go.

37:31.400 --> 37:34.400
Sir, shall we pursue the slaves?

37:35.300 --> 37:37.600
Let the desert have them.
They won't get far.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.500
Yes, sir.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.700
- Orders, sir?
- Tend to the slaves.

37:55.900 --> 37:58.000
- We leave for Sodom before daybreak.
- Yes, sir.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.400
I wonder who they are.

38:00.300 --> 38:02.200
Their hats are really great,
aren't they?

38:02.300 --> 38:03.700
Their hats?

38:03.800 --> 38:05.900
When that guy
cut the other guy's head off...

38:06.100 --> 38:08.100
...I wasn't thinking about
what a great hat.

38:08.200 --> 38:12.100
It wasn't my very first thought, but I'd
be lying if I said it wasn't up there.

38:12.300 --> 38:14.300
I'm just saying, if I can snag one,
I'm going to.

38:15.200 --> 38:18.000
Now I just have to figure out a way
to rescue Maya and Eema.

38:18.100 --> 38:21.500
How are we gonna rescue them?
These guys are killers.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.500
Even killers have to sleep sometime.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.200
That was refreshing.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.800
Shit!

38:42.500 --> 38:43.500
They're gone.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.700
Now where do we go?

38:45.900 --> 38:49.900
They said they were going to Sodom.
We're going to Sodom.

38:51.400 --> 38:55.300
I think I have sand in my ass,
but there's no way of knowing for sure.

38:55.500 --> 38:58.500
I'll take a look in it
when we get to Sodom.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.600
We making a burnt offering
or something?

39:02.800 --> 39:06.100
Yes, Isaac.
As God has commanded me.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.000
But I don't see the sheep anywhere.

39:08.200 --> 39:12.800
The Lord. The Lord shall provide
the sheep, my son.

39:12.900 --> 39:15.200
What is this?
Is this some sort of magic trick?

39:15.400 --> 39:18.400
In a way. In a way.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.800
If this is because I didn't clean up
my tent, I'm sorry.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.900
I'll do it right when I get home.

39:25.100 --> 39:26.600
Oh, Dad, why are you doing this?

39:26.800 --> 39:31.000
The Lord has spoken unto me, Isaac,
and I must obey him.

39:31.100 --> 39:34.400
If the Lord told you to jump off a cliff,
would you do it?

39:35.000 --> 39:36.600
- Forgive me, Isaac.
- My God.

39:36.800 --> 39:39.200
Stop! What are you doing
with that kid?

39:41.800 --> 39:43.300
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

39:43.500 --> 39:46.200
This is my son, sir.
We were playing a game.

39:46.400 --> 39:50.400
All right?
It's called Burny Burny Cut Cut.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.800
You weren't.
You were gonna kill him.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.600
I was not going to kill him.
I was going to sacrifice him.

39:56.800 --> 39:59.300
- There is a tremendous difference.
- Not to him.

39:59.400 --> 40:05.100
By what right dost thou interfere?
Art thou sent by the Lord?

40:06.700 --> 40:09.000
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.

40:09.100 --> 40:12.500
- Aye. Aye, verily, thou art.
- Verily. Yea.

40:12.600 --> 40:16.700
Thou were sent by the Eternal One
to stay my hand.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.600
- All of that.
- This is Isaac.

40:20.700 --> 40:25.100
And I am Abraham, the son of Terah
of the House of Nahor.

40:25.300 --> 40:29.800
We were two doors down from Nahor.
We were Nahor's neighbors.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.800
And I am Zed, son of Zero.

40:31.900 --> 40:36.100
And this is Oh, son of Ooh
from the House of Sticks and Dung.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.700
The tents of my kinsmen
lie just beyond.

40:38.800 --> 40:41.500
Come. Come, my friends.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.200
We are the Hebrews.

40:43.400 --> 40:47.100
A righteous people,
but not very good at sports.

40:47.300 --> 40:48.800
This way, friends. Come.

40:50.300 --> 40:51.600
Brothers, brothers.

40:52.700 --> 40:56.200
Let us give thanks
unto the Lord thy God...

40:56.300 --> 41:00.400
...for staying my hand on the mountain
this very day.

41:00.600 --> 41:03.600
Praise be to God,
hallowed be his name.

41:03.800 --> 41:05.200
And let us also praise him...

41:05.300 --> 41:08.500
...for the bounty
which he hath bestowed unto us.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.200
He hath increased our wealth...

41:10.400 --> 41:11.900
...and blessed us with...

41:12.000 --> 41:15.100
Thanks. Thank you.
A lot of loving things.

41:15.300 --> 41:16.700
- Kind loving kindness.
- Yeah.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.800
Friends, whence comest thou?

41:20.400 --> 41:23.200
- He wants to know where you're from.
- Thou comest not from...

41:23.400 --> 41:26.300
...the Cities of the Plain,
from Sodom and Gomorrah.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.700
- Heard of them, never been there.
- Are they nice?

41:28.900 --> 41:30.100
"Are they nice?"

41:30.200 --> 41:33.000
They have been cursed for all time
by the Lord thy God...

41:33.200 --> 41:35.600
...for their abominations.
- I did not know that.

41:35.800 --> 41:39.000
They worship idols
and they bow down before false gods.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.100
- Abdominal.
- It's the worst.

41:41.300 --> 41:44.300
The men of that city
are weak and soft...

41:44.400 --> 41:47.700
...fat with rich food,
intoxicated by strong drink.

41:47.800 --> 41:50.000
I'm not hearing the bad part.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.500
The women are whores.

41:52.700 --> 41:55.100
Their shameless lust
knows no bounds.

41:55.300 --> 41:56.500
They flaunt their flesh...

41:56.700 --> 42:00.100
...and any man may have knowledge
of them whenever he so chooseth.

42:00.700 --> 42:03.100
Which one of the two cities
has the most whores?

42:04.100 --> 42:07.700
Just so we know to stay away
from that one especially.

42:07.900 --> 42:11.100
Walk you not the path of Sodom.

42:11.300 --> 42:13.700
For the Lord thy God
has said unto me...

42:13.900 --> 42:16.800
...that he shall send a holy fire
to destroy that city...

42:16.900 --> 42:19.800
...and all who dwell within
for their iniquity.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.900
He shall smite them.

42:23.100 --> 42:26.800
Them, and all of their seed.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.900
So when do you think
this smiting's gonna go down?

42:31.000 --> 42:33.700
- Because we have some friends there.
- Their fate is sealed.

42:34.200 --> 42:37.000
But for my faith and devotion...

42:37.200 --> 42:38.400
...that self-same God...

42:38.500 --> 42:42.300
...has promised unto me
the whole of this land.

42:42.800 --> 42:46.800
From the Heights of Golan in the north
to the Sinai in the south.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.100
From the river of Jordan
to the great sea.

42:50.300 --> 42:53.300
- This is all your land?
- For all of eternity.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.800
But apparently God
forgot to tell anyone else.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.900
We're at war with someone
every other day.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.100
Excuse me. I and my kinsmen
have vanquished our enemies...

43:01.300 --> 43:03.900
...by the mighty hand
of God, blessed be he.

43:04.100 --> 43:06.300
- Praised is his name...
- Unto us.

43:06.400 --> 43:08.800
...and glory his graciousness.
- Wealthy bounty.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
Therefore, to signify my covenant
with the one true God...

43:13.100 --> 43:17.800
...I shall on this day
circumcise the flesh of my penis.

43:18.000 --> 43:23.400
And of you. And you, and of you,
and every male who dwelleth hereby.

43:24.200 --> 43:26.700
- Excuse me?
- I don't know what you mean.

43:26.900 --> 43:30.000
We shall grasp the foreskins
of our penises...

43:30.100 --> 43:33.600
...and we shall cut therefrom
the extra flesh. Amen.

43:35.400 --> 43:38.200
I don't think I have any extra.

43:38.400 --> 43:41.000
- Couldn't we pierce our ears?
- No, no, no.

43:41.200 --> 43:43.600
So it shall be written,
and so it shall be done.

43:43.700 --> 43:47.400
Let me get this straight. You're saying
you have too much cock?

43:47.500 --> 43:49.000
And you wanna:

43:49.500 --> 43:54.400
You know, Abe, it's been a long day,
we've all had a lot to drink...

43:54.500 --> 43:58.000
...and I know that this foreskin thing
sounds like a good idea now...

43:58.200 --> 44:00.300
...but you might wanna sleep on it.

44:00.500 --> 44:02.300
We can always cut it off
in the morning.

44:02.500 --> 44:05.700
But if we do it now, there's just no way
to get it back on there.

44:05.800 --> 44:08.700
No, no, no, trust me, it's gonna be
a very, very sleek look.

44:08.900 --> 44:13.100
This is gonna catch on. I'm gonna go
get my good knife.

44:15.100 --> 44:18.800
Just wait right there. I'll be right back
to cut your penises.

44:19.600 --> 44:23.400
Not the whole thing,
you understand. Just the very tip.

44:23.600 --> 44:26.700
And after, we're all gonna have wine
and sponge cake.

44:29.300 --> 44:31.200
Do you have any idea
where we're going?

44:31.400 --> 44:33.500
Going to Sodom.
We have to save Maya and Eema.

44:33.600 --> 44:36.200
He said that God
was gonna smite Sodom with holy fire.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.600
God also told him to chop off
the tip of his dick.

44:38.800 --> 44:44.200
Dad, no! No! No!

44:45.200 --> 44:48.700
So listen, I've been thinking,
what constitutes the tip of the penis?

44:48.800 --> 44:51.600
Because his definition
might not be the same as mine.

44:51.800 --> 44:55.400
- What if the tip is your favorite part?
- The tip is your only part.

44:59.300 --> 45:01.100
Come out here.

45:01.300 --> 45:04.800
Hey, you caught me. Guilty.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.100
What are you doing here?

45:06.300 --> 45:08.600
- I'm gonna come.
- You don't know where we're going.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.400
- You're going to Sodom, right?
- No.

45:10.500 --> 45:13.200
How stupid you think I am?
You've had a boner for Sodom...

45:13.400 --> 45:16.300
...since my dad mentioned it.
If I take you, get me some wine.

45:16.400 --> 45:17.900
Aren't you a bit young?

45:18.100 --> 45:20.500
Do you like hanging out
with this little girl?

45:21.800 --> 45:23.700
My dad just trimmed my dick skin.

45:26.200 --> 45:28.700
That's Sodom right there.
The Unholy Land.

45:28.900 --> 45:32.900
The devil's playground,
where the sinners are winners.

45:34.300 --> 45:36.800
Me and my boys sneak in here
on the weekends sometimes.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.600
Pick up on the babes,
drink some wine, smoke some herb.

45:39.800 --> 45:42.200
- Shouldn't be smoking either.
- Thanks a lot, Grandpa.

45:42.400 --> 45:45.200
I've been smoking for four harvests
now, so I think I'm good.

45:48.100 --> 45:49.600
These doors are enormous.

45:50.600 --> 45:53.400
- It looks like they're not open, so...
- You just gotta knock.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.500
- They let me in all the time.
- Yeah, knock.

45:55.700 --> 45:57.200
- Why don't you knock?
- You knock.

45:57.300 --> 46:00.300
- What if we're waking somebody?
- Eema and Maya might be in there.

46:00.500 --> 46:02.200
I gave them our word
we'd rescue them.

46:02.400 --> 46:05.000
I want to get my dicky sticky.

46:07.300 --> 46:10.100
- Halt. Halt.
- Get help. Tell your father.

46:10.300 --> 46:13.000
Like I'm gonna tell my father
I came with you guys to Sodom.

46:13.200 --> 46:14.400
So long, suckers.

46:14.600 --> 46:17.000
I kind of get why his dad
wanted to kill him.

46:19.400 --> 46:21.100
Get in.

46:22.600 --> 46:25.700
- What's this, then?
- They were banging on the gate.

46:25.900 --> 46:29.800
- Hebrews from the look of them.
- Well, we're not really Hebrews.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.200
We are Hebrews?

46:33.900 --> 46:35.500
I get it. No talking.

46:35.700 --> 46:37.800
- Should we wake the commander?
- Oh, no.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.100
Don't want to wake the commander.
He gets mean when you wake him.

46:42.300 --> 46:44.300
Meaner than this?

46:48.200 --> 46:50.200
Let go of his titty.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.300
Yeah. Okay. All right, good one.

46:53.500 --> 46:57.700
What the bloody hell
is going on out there?

47:00.800 --> 47:05.300
Who screamed?
Sounded like a woman.

47:06.100 --> 47:09.600
But you don't look like a woman.
You wanna kiss me?

47:09.800 --> 47:11.900
Like in a romantic way?

47:13.600 --> 47:16.100
By tomorrow morning,
you'll wish you hadn't been born.

47:16.300 --> 47:18.300
- I already feel that way right now.
- Yeah.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.400
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

47:20.600 --> 47:25.000
Because that I would pay to see.
You versus a guy your size.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.000
Give me my stick.

47:32.700 --> 47:35.500
Bumpy. You got a smoother one?

47:36.300 --> 47:37.500
Yeah.

47:37.700 --> 47:40.200
Turn around
and put your hands on the table.

47:41.100 --> 47:42.700
Now!

47:43.400 --> 47:45.500
I'll take that kiss now.

47:46.900 --> 47:49.800
- We'll start with the fat one.
- Relatively fat. I mean...

47:50.000 --> 47:53.600
- Welcome to Sodom.
- Hey, I want a piece of that.

47:54.200 --> 47:57.600
- Cain?
- You know them?

47:59.400 --> 48:00.800
Brothers.

48:01.600 --> 48:07.900
I missed you so much. Oh, you guys.
Promise you'll never leave me again.

48:11.500 --> 48:13.600
- This is amazing.
- And this is a Monday.

48:13.800 --> 48:15.600
You should see this place
on a Thursday.

48:15.800 --> 48:19.000
- Because Thursday's the new Friday.
- Well, thanks for saving us.

48:19.200 --> 48:23.000
- What are you gonna do to us now?
- Excuse me? Do I detect a tone here?

48:23.500 --> 48:25.200
You did sell us into slavery.

48:25.400 --> 48:28.600
Hold a grudge much?
That was, like, a fortnight ago.

48:28.800 --> 48:30.900
It was less than a fortnight.
Half a fortnight.

48:31.100 --> 48:34.200
- It was a sevennight.
- Oh, give me a break.

48:34.300 --> 48:36.100
I was dealing with the death...

48:36.200 --> 48:39.600
...of a close, personal family member
and I needed some space.

48:39.700 --> 48:43.800
But hey, now I realize that you guys
are like my real brothers.

48:43.900 --> 48:48.500
And it's so rare to have a brother
that you love and don't wanna kill.

48:49.300 --> 48:50.500
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

48:50.700 --> 48:52.200
Hey, who's hungry?

48:52.300 --> 48:53.600
- I'm hungry.
- Don't kill me.

48:53.800 --> 48:55.400
Yeah? Okay.

48:56.100 --> 48:58.500
Excuse me, I was...

48:58.600 --> 49:02.500
Yeah, that's two for flinching.
Hey, let's go.

49:05.200 --> 49:07.400
Here. Now we're even.

49:08.200 --> 49:12.100
Check out the woman across the way.
She's looking at us.

49:12.300 --> 49:16.100
She's totally eye-knowing us
with her eyes right now.

49:38.800 --> 49:41.100
Well, she's really making
that banana last.

49:43.900 --> 49:46.600
- Go talk to her.
- I kind of have a girlfriend right now.

49:46.700 --> 49:49.800
A girl that I'm going to marry.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.600
Make my wife, make her my girlfriend
one day when I get enough strength.

49:53.800 --> 49:57.300
What transpires within the confines
of the walls of Sodom...

49:57.500 --> 50:00.400
...stays within the confines of the walls
of Sodom.

50:00.800 --> 50:05.100
If you guys are gonna stay here,
you should join the guard.

50:05.300 --> 50:08.500
- Hey!
- Hey, hey what, hey? Huh? Yeah.

50:08.800 --> 50:11.800
I mean, the pay's not great
but the perks, tons of them.

50:11.800 --> 50:15.600
I'm telling you, it's the only way to go.
Come on, let's go talk to the sergeant.

50:16.700 --> 50:19.500
- Let's go.
- Hurry now.

50:25.800 --> 50:27.700
This is great. How do I look?

50:28.100 --> 50:31.700
I can't see. This is too big on me.
I wonder if I can get a smaller size.

50:31.900 --> 50:35.900
Yeah, someone's gotta be
the hat person around here.

50:36.100 --> 50:37.800
- Find a...
- Excuse me.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.200
Hey, my helmet is way too big
for me. It looks really silly.

50:41.300 --> 50:44.200
- Think I can get a smaller one?
- Line up!

50:46.200 --> 50:50.800
- What are you doing? In the line.
- Wait, he's not...

50:51.400 --> 50:53.600
In the line. Face forward in the line.

50:53.800 --> 50:56.000
- Guys. Guys?
- I don't know where to...

50:56.100 --> 50:58.000
- Guys.
- You too!

50:58.600 --> 51:02.100
- Guys.
- Find a hole, you stupid bastards.

51:02.300 --> 51:04.300
- It's kind of obvious, isn't it?
- Not to me.

51:04.500 --> 51:06.900
Soldiers. Present arms.

51:11.400 --> 51:14.500
I never got a sword.
I only got the holder.

51:15.100 --> 51:18.000
I didn't know
that that's what it was for.

51:18.500 --> 51:21.500
- So this is it? We just walk around?
- Yeah, pretty much.

51:21.700 --> 51:23.000
Just look for troublemakers.

51:23.200 --> 51:27.200
If you see a thief or a pickpocket,
we'll slap them around a little bit.

51:27.300 --> 51:31.400
Maybe cut off a finger, you know,
or tip of the nose sometimes.

51:31.600 --> 51:36.200
Lower lip. Just anything you can grab
and slice in one fluid motion.

51:36.300 --> 51:37.600
It seems kind of harsh.

51:37.800 --> 51:42.500
Hey, just remember it's the palace
that pays us, not the people. Come on.

51:42.700 --> 51:45.000
Feed us!

51:47.500 --> 51:52.900
Six sacrifices in the last 10 days
and still no rain.

51:53.100 --> 51:57.100
Majesty, there's talk of revolution
in the streets.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.800
Oil and grain are scarce,
prices are high.

51:59.900 --> 52:04.400
Starving peasants are pouring
into the city in search of food.

52:04.900 --> 52:07.500
We could actually have a riot
on our hands.

52:07.600 --> 52:10.900
Poverty has a bitter taste,
but it is a flavor they are born to.

52:11.100 --> 52:15.200
It is the will of the gods.
What do the entrails predict?

52:17.400 --> 52:22.700
Well, the liver is streaked with gray,
which is not a good sign...

52:22.900 --> 52:26.300
...but his poor rectum
is absolutely pulverized...

52:26.500 --> 52:29.400
...which is not unusual
for a sheep in this region.

52:29.600 --> 52:31.400
The genitals are enormous.

52:31.600 --> 52:33.900
That's of no significance,
I'm just commenting.

52:34.100 --> 52:35.800
If you do look at this intestine...

52:36.000 --> 52:38.400
...his large intestine
is arranged in an arc...

52:38.600 --> 52:41.300
...then the two massive balls
of the sheep are like eyes.

52:41.400 --> 52:44.100
To me, I see a happy face.
That makes me happy.

52:44.600 --> 52:45.900
What does it mean?

52:46.100 --> 52:51.000
Well, could mean a surprise visit
from a former friend or sweetheart.

52:51.100 --> 52:53.500
Or that you're going
on a long sea voyage.

52:53.600 --> 52:55.500
Could I come?
I've never been on a boat.

52:55.600 --> 52:58.100
How did you become high priest?

52:59.000 --> 53:00.400
I'm your brother-in-law.

53:00.500 --> 53:03.000
Perhaps it's time
for a new high priest.

53:08.500 --> 53:12.800
Perhaps it's not time
for a new high priest.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.900
Let that be a warning to you.

53:25.100 --> 53:29.700
Next time, I shall hurl a lightning bolt
right in your face.

53:29.900 --> 53:31.700
Or a fireball.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.500
And you know what's the best part
about Sodom? The sodomy.

53:35.700 --> 53:37.600
You guys are in for a treat.

53:56.700 --> 53:58.200
Down.

53:58.400 --> 54:00.600
Did you see that girl?

54:00.900 --> 54:02.300
That was Princess Inanna.

54:02.500 --> 54:05.100
She's totally hot.
Don't even think about it.

54:05.500 --> 54:06.500
Why not?

54:06.700 --> 54:09.600
Why? Because she's royalty
and you're a caveman.

54:09.700 --> 54:11.000
Where's everybody going?

54:11.200 --> 54:13.400
To the temple.
You guys have to see this.

54:13.500 --> 54:15.800
- Will she be there?
- Yeah, everyone'll be there.

54:27.200 --> 54:28.900
There she is.

54:39.600 --> 54:41.100
The princess isn't eating.

54:41.200 --> 54:43.800
I find it hard to eat
when so many are hungry.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.200
- You can't keep starving yourself.
- Why not?

54:47.300 --> 54:50.300
Everybody else is starving.
Present company excluded.

54:50.500 --> 54:52.100
Careful, princess.

54:52.300 --> 54:55.600
You may be my stepdaughter,
but these are dangerous times...

54:55.800 --> 54:59.300
...and those are dangerous words.
- Whatever.

55:00.100 --> 55:01.500
Hi.

55:02.700 --> 55:04.200
Yeah.

55:14.100 --> 55:16.800
- What's happening?
- They're picking a virgin.

55:21.300 --> 55:24.800
Oh, please. If you're a virgin,
then I'm a fuzzy little gerbil.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.400
Back to the whorehouse with you.
Quick as a bunny. There you go.

55:28.500 --> 55:30.000
What do they need a virgin for?

55:30.200 --> 55:33.400
- To throw her in the fire. Are you new?
- What? Why?

55:34.900 --> 55:36.600
An offering to the gods.

55:37.100 --> 55:39.400
- Are you serious?
- There's a famine going on...

55:39.600 --> 55:42.000
...so if we make
a good enough sacrifice...

55:42.200 --> 55:45.600
...then the gods give us rain.
You get rain, you get harvest...

55:45.700 --> 55:48.400
...you get harvest, you get food.
You know what food is?

55:48.600 --> 55:51.000
Yeah, you know food.

55:51.200 --> 55:54.200
So they're gonna throw a virgin
into the fire so that it rains?

55:55.800 --> 55:58.400
Where do you think rain
comes from? Clouds?

55:58.600 --> 56:00.100
My 6-year-old knows.

56:00.200 --> 56:04.200
- Hey, how do you get rain?
- Burn a virgin.

56:05.400 --> 56:07.900
I didn't think
it was anything related to...

56:08.100 --> 56:10.300
Yeah, yeah. "I didn't think,
I didn't think."

56:10.500 --> 56:13.200
It's the gods and it comes
from virgins being burned.

56:13.600 --> 56:15.300
Did I do something to offend you?

56:15.500 --> 56:18.900
I come here, I get a great seat
at the sacrifice, and you're ruining it.

56:21.200 --> 56:23.800
Seems like a waste
of a perfectly good virgin to me.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.400
Hey, guys? I'm trying to enjoy
the sacrifice with my family.

56:27.500 --> 56:29.600
Do you mind? Do you mind?

56:29.700 --> 56:31.000
For the love of the gods...

56:31.200 --> 56:33.900
...we commit this fair maiden...

56:34.500 --> 56:37.800
...to Moloch's holy fire.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.300
These virgins, it's always a girl?

56:45.500 --> 56:48.700
I'm really happy for her.
She was always the runner-up.

56:48.900 --> 56:49.900
True success story.

56:50.100 --> 56:53.200
My lord,
the princess wishes to see you.

56:53.400 --> 56:55.200
Me? What about my friend?

56:55.400 --> 56:57.100
Can the two of us come?
We're a pair.

56:57.300 --> 57:00.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The three of us are like a pair.

57:00.300 --> 57:03.700
No, not you.
The two of you, follow me.

57:03.900 --> 57:05.500
Great.

57:06.300 --> 57:09.200
- I'll try to put a good word in for you.
- Yeah, do.

57:09.400 --> 57:13.200
If we never, ever see you again,
it's not because we're avoiding you.

57:13.600 --> 57:15.100
Don't forget about me.

57:18.700 --> 57:22.100
This is Zaftig, the eunuch.
You, go with him.

57:22.700 --> 57:24.100
Oh, can't I go with him?

57:24.300 --> 57:29.000
- Why? Is he your lover?
- No, we're just friends.

57:29.100 --> 57:30.400
That would be weird.
We're both guys.

57:32.800 --> 57:35.500
- Come with me.
- What do you do?

57:35.600 --> 57:38.200
I've been a palace eunuch
since I was 9 years old.

57:38.400 --> 57:41.100
- How would I become a eunuch?
- They cut off your testicles.

57:41.200 --> 57:43.000
Why all the genital mutilation?

57:43.200 --> 57:47.400
Well, you get to keep them.
I always keep mine close at hand.

57:47.600 --> 57:49.400
Would you like to see?

57:49.600 --> 57:50.900
No.

58:01.400 --> 58:02.600
Can I ask your opinion?

58:02.700 --> 58:06.000
What do you think?
Ponytail or no ponytail?

58:06.200 --> 58:10.200
- I don't know and I really don't care.
- Okay. I just wanted to know...

58:10.400 --> 58:13.900
...what the ladies of Sodom
were into nowadays, but...

58:15.100 --> 58:17.600
This party is insane.

58:17.900 --> 58:21.700
It's more of a hair-down
kind of scene, I'd say.

58:23.600 --> 58:24.900
Hi.

58:33.600 --> 58:35.600
Be sure to try the fruit.

58:38.700 --> 58:40.600
Maya. What are you doing here?

58:41.100 --> 58:43.600
Okay, I'm still alive,
thank you for asking...

58:43.700 --> 58:45.400
...and I'm still a slave.

58:45.600 --> 58:48.800
I was coming to rescue you. Really.
That's why we were here.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.400
- We were gonna find you.
- Yeah?

58:50.500 --> 58:53.400
You seemed worried
about your ponytail just a second ago.

58:54.400 --> 58:55.600
I was just...

58:55.800 --> 58:58.200
- You were just chosen again.
- I was.

58:58.400 --> 59:01.000
I would love to join you at this orgy,
but I can't...

59:01.200 --> 59:05.800
...because I have to go be a slave,
and I don't get any breaks.

59:07.600 --> 59:09.700
And the princess has crabs.

59:14.800 --> 59:17.400
Oh, yes, it's steamy.

59:18.500 --> 59:20.600
God, that's realistic.

59:21.300 --> 59:22.600
Watch it, jerk.

59:23.700 --> 59:25.300
A real woman, that's...

59:25.500 --> 59:27.500
Oh, excuse me, Miss...

59:27.600 --> 59:32.200
Ter. Mister. Awkward.

59:34.900 --> 59:37.200
Good concentration.

59:37.800 --> 59:40.200
You're good. You're real good.

59:44.300 --> 59:47.900
- Oh? Is that you?
- I'm not supposed to talk, I'm a statue.

59:48.100 --> 59:53.200
- Yeah, you look so gold.
- It's all the gold paint.

59:53.300 --> 59:55.300
- How's it going?
- It's going great.

59:55.400 --> 59:59.500
I just had my entire body
painted by a fat guy with no balls.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.800
- Oh, how did that go?
- He was extremely thorough.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.200
- How's it going with you?
- Not bad.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.300
Just had a little rub and scrub.
Now I'm up for some grub.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.000
- Sounds luxurious.
- Hey.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:13.900
You remember that woman
who brought us in with the face dress?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.500
That was Maya. She's working here
now and she looks great.

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:20.100
- Kind of mad at me, though.
- And there's Eema.

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.200
Come here, wench.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.200
Let me have a look
what's up that skirt.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.600
- I'm sorry, it was an accident.
- It was no accident.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:34.800
Hey. You. Slave girl.
I told you to fetch me more wine.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.600
- Apologize to this officer now.
- I'm sorry.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.700
Good. Now go fetch.
Wait over there by the skinny statue.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.800
I'll deal with you later. Go!

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.900
Slaves. What are you gonna do?

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.800
Wait a minute.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.300
Don't I know you?

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.800
- What are you, crazy?
- I will not serve these people.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.500
- I'd rather die.
- Keep it up. You will.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.900
Have you joined them?

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.400
I haven't joined anything.
I'm not having fun.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.000
I'm just checking it out.
A lot to learn here.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:25.200
- What, human sacrifice?
- No. No human sacrifices.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.500
I've been chosen
to do something great.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.900
Yeah, here we go.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:33.600
I'm pretty sure it's not hunting pigs
and weaving baskets.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.900
- Oh?
- Hello, Maya.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.100
She wants to see you. Now.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.800
Don't think
I'm interested in her.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.300
- Whyever would I think that?
- It's part of my plan.

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.500
I'm gonna get us out of here
soon as I can.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.800
- The princess awaits you.
- And I await her.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:56.600
You two, await me.
Stay out of trouble. Stay gold.

01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.800
He has no idea what he's doing,
does he?

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:02.800
- It's nice to see you like this.
- It's nice to see you too.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.300
We should do something.
When do you get off?

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:09.800
- Never. I'm a slave.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.400
Slave girl, bring me a towel.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:15.200
Yeah, I should go be a slave.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.900
I'm gonna strike a specific pose,
I guess.

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.800
- Okay.
- I love you.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:31.900
You there. Golden boy.
Come here.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.100
Rub me with oil.

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:45.400
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
That's not...

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.800
I'm not one of the oil rubbers,
I'm just a guard.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.800
Rub me with oil or die.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:03.200
- Is that enough?
- Much more. Baste me like a chicken.

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:08.000
Oh, yes. Pour it all over me,
you little bronze bitchlet.

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:11.000
Yeah, okay. You got the whole thing
on you now.

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:12.600
Marvelous, I love it.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.200
All right, well, have a good evening.
I'm glad I could help you out.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.600
Now rub it in.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.500
With my hand?

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:25.200
No. With your nutsack.
Of course, with your hand.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.500
Oh, yes.

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.400
Oh, yes, the oily oiliness.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:36.900
The musky, precious,
smoky, oily oiliness.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.200
Yes, that's right.
Oh, God, paint a picture on my body.

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.100
- Tell a story on my nipples.
- Yeah.

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.900
That's right, take me down
the smoky Euphrates.

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:47.400
Do something
you'll be ashamed of later...

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.100
...you naughty little goat.
All right, charm the snake.

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.600
- Eema. Hey...
- Oh, just like that. Now slap me.

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:55.700
- This isn't what it looks like.
- My tummy. Go ahead, slap me.

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:59.100
- Slap me. Slap the tummy.
- No, it's fine. I mean, I understand.

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:02.500
Go on. I love it, I love it.
Oh, you're very gifted.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:06.000
No, no, no. I'm just rubbing oil
on this man's chest. Eema.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.400
A gift. I don't know,
you've got some sort of gift.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:20.000
- Good luck.
- Look, Maya. Maya.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.700
Come to me.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.100
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.700
You can see Gomorrah
just over the hill.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.900
Yep. Twin cities.

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.500
People think that the gods
are gonna wipe them out...

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:40.000
...because they're so evil.
- And what do you think? Am I evil?

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:44.100
Well, I don't really know you,
but you don't look evil.

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.000
Do you find me attractive?

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.800
Yeah.

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.300
Let me ask you one thing.

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:54.000
What would a girl like you
want with a guy like me?

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:59.600
I don't know.
I just find you interesting.

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.000
They say it's the will of the gods...

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.700
...that some men should suffer
while others rule.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:07.400
That we're all just victims
of our own fate.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.300
I believed that until this morning...

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:13.100
...when I saw you standing up alone
in the square and I said to myself:

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:18.100
"Yes! Finally, here's one man
who refuses to bow down to anything.

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:21.100
A man with the courage
to question the order of things.

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:26.600
A man chosen by the gods
to do something great."

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.600
That's exactly
what I've been thinking.

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:31.100
You would not believe the stuff
happening to me.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.900
- I just didn't know why.
- I know why.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.300
To bring you here. To this place.
To me.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.400
I could not agree more.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:46.100
I'm trying to agree more, but I can't,
because that's how much I agree.

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:48.600
Come.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.500
This must be difficult
for you to understand...

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.400
...but my life is devoted
to the service of the gods...

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.700
...and the good of the people.
I keep nothing for myself.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:05.200
- That's very unselfish of you.
- It is unselfish of me, isn't it?

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:07.400
You're so perceptive
for one so young.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.600
- Yeah. What are those doors there?
- Behind these doors...

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.700
...is the Holy of Holies,
earthly domain of the gods.

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:18.100
A place so ineffably sacred,
so powerful...

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.400
...that to enter is instant death.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.100
- Who cleans it?
- Needs no cleaning.

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:26.800
Kind of makes you think
about the people that built it.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.700
Like, did they die instantly...

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:30.800
...or were they given
a courtesy second...

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.800
...to get out of there by the gods?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.700
They were allowed to finish,
given four and a half seconds...

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.800
...then the gods descended.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:41.800
- What if a bug goes in there?
- Instant death for the bug.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.900
Are there dead bugs all over?
Because nobody cleans it.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
They're vaporized immediately...

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:51.400
...by a holy beam
of vapory fire vapor.

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.500
- Can we go in?
- I just told you.

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:58.300
To enter is instant death,
you gorgeous little dunce.

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.000
Can't even poke our heads in?

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.100
You're so young and curious,
aren't you?

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:05.700
You want to know it all
and taste it all, explore it all, be it all...

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.800
...dance with it all, suck it all,
don't you?

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.300
I've got a riddle for you.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.200
What has two thumbs...

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.500
...and is desperate
for another hot-oil rub?

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.600
- What?
- This person.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:21.000
Come on. Let's go.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:26.100
- Come. Come quick.
- That will not be a problem.

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.700
What are we doing here?

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.900
I want you to enter
the Holy of Holies.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.900
Oh, that is quite a coincidence...

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:39.100
...because I want you to sit
on the Poley of Poleys.

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:44.400
- Oh, no. That's the Holy of Holies.
- I thought you were talking about...

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:47.800
You have to go in there
and speak to the gods.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.500
- The gods are in there?
- So they say.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.000
The only one who goes in there
is the high priest.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.900
They say it's instant death
for anyone else to enter.

01:07:56.100 --> 01:08:00.400
- Then why am I going in?
- Because you've been chosen.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.400
If the gods wanted you dead,
they would've killed you already.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.500
- Right.
- This is what you've been chosen for.

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.000
To speak to the gods,
divine their purpose...

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:12.500
...and plead with them
to end this terrible famine.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.100
Then come back out
and tell me what it's like inside.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.300
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:17.800
Right.

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:27.000
I'm pretty sure I'm chosen,
but I'm not "sure" sure.

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:28.800
You're chosen.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.300
Okay. I'm gonna go in,
but you gotta do something for me.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:35.500
- You gotta let my friends go.
- Anything.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:51.700
Don't kill me, don't kill me,
don't kill me...

01:08:51.899 --> 01:08:54.399
Get up. You look ridiculous.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:00.800
- Oh? What are you doing here?
- I'm hiding from the high priest.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.200
I spent the last two hours
rubbing oil on him.

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:06.000
Is that chest hair?

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.399
Not all of it. Just don't ask, okay?

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:11.600
I've lost my sense
of right and wrong.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.300
How did you get in here
without getting fried?

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:15.899
- I don't know. How did you?
- Because I'm a chosen.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.300
Probably why God didn't kill you:
He knew you were my follower.

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:23.200
- I'm not your follower.
- Why are you always following me?

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.899
I'm not following you. I walk
behind you at the same pace as you.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.300
Not following.
I could be leading from the rear.

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:32.600
Come on. I'm the leader.
I always have been.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.899
Some leader.
Told us you were gonna get us out.

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:38.300
- Just been messing around at orgies.
- Messing around at orgies?

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:39.700
No, no. I'm not like you.

01:09:39.899 --> 01:09:42.600
I don't get to prance around
in gold paint and have fun.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.899
- I have no downtime.
- Please. Your whole life is downtime.

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:48.500
That's what you think?
That's what everybody thinks.

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:51.700
I'm about to show you something.
Observe.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:01.100
Almighty God, or gods,
whatever the case may be...

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.600
...I need to ask a favor of you.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.500
I know
I've really messed things up...

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:10.200
...but I really need to come through
on this one...

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.500
...and I wanna ask you to please give
me the strength to free my friends.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.500
- And that's it, that's the favor.
- Oh, shit.

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:23.400
And also,
if you could just make it rain...

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:28.300
...or like drizzle without us having
to kill a virgin, you know what I mean?

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:31.800
Because we need our virgins
at the moment.

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.200
And also, if you could give me
the power...

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:38.100
...to see through women's clothing
without them knowing...

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.200
...that would be really great.

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:43.200
Hello?

01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:45.700
Hasn't it occurred to you
that it might be silent...

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:49.600
...because God is not in here?
Look around. There's nothing in here.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.400
That doesn't prove anything.
Maybe he stepped away.

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.400
- For what?
- God stuff.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.000
If he needs something,
he can create it from nothing.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.000
What's the point of being God
if you keep running for things?

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.200
Let me just put something out there.
Maybe God doesn't exist.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.900
What? So everything is just random?

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.800
Then nothing would mean anything.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.100
- What would be the point?
- That is the point.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:15.200
That there's no point? That's stupid.

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:16.400
- You're stupid.
- No.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.800
- There's something bigger than me.
- There's nothing bigger than you.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
- Don't touch my belly to make a point.
- Fine.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.700
- Okay. I'm sorry, I have a man's body.
- I'm maturing at my own pace.

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.400
- You are so jealous of me.
- Jealous? That you're a bullshit artist?

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.600
That every time you speak,
it's bullshit coming out of your mouth?

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:36.000
You would believe in God
if you've ever been with a woman.

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.600
- I'm a virgin by choice.
- Not your choice.

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:40.500
- Take that back.
- I won't.

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:43.000
- Take back what you said.
- Take back what you said.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.500
Everything you've ever said.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.000
Don't stand close.
Get your belly off of my belly.

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:48.400
Don't touch my belly.

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:50.800
I don't want to touch bellies with you,
ever.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.700
Take everything
you've ever said back.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.900
- You're out of control.
- You're a freak.

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:58.600
- Stop screaming, stop screaming.
- You're a freak! Get off me.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.800
I can pull this thing together.
The princess is right out there.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.400
And if I play this right...

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.700
...l'm gonna get us all out of here,
Maya and Eema too.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.000
Just trust in me. Have a little faith.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:16.800
Fine, but not for you. For Eema.
And I'm too tired to argue right now.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.500
I had a long hot bath with the
high priest, and I'm lightheaded.

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:23.100
I'm sorry for squeezing you so hard.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.300
Let's go. Freak.

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:33.200
God, if you do exist,
if you make Eema love me...

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:36.700
...I would be very grateful. Okay?

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.200
If you do exist.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.900
You guys waiting to go in there?

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.200
Because I gotta say:
Not that big a deal.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.200
If you see a broken penis,
it was like that when we went in.

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:51.400
Seize him.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.500
I'm seized.

01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:03.800
I wish I was upside down.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.700
Looks kind of fun.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.700
Is it fun?

01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.200
So you're not talking to me?

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:18.000
We're not friends anymore,
after all I've done for you?

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:21.000
- What have you done for me?
- I brought you out of your shell.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:24.500
Yeah? I liked my shell.
I liked the village.

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:28.200
Because of you, I'm in this horrible
place where brothers kill brothers...

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.100
...and they burn women
and they make people slaves.

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.300
People cut off
the ends of their penises...

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.400
...and their testicles and I'm
never gonna see Eema again...

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.100
...and it's because of you.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:41.800
Please forgive me.
I mean, you are my best friend.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.200
I hate the world! I hate you!

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.200
And now I'm hanging upside down
and I really have to pee.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.800
I know I'm not perfect.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.300
And maybe I made a few wrong turns,
but you gotta understand I'm chosen.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.100
That's a lot of responsibility.
You can't even imagine.

01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:00.800
The only one that thinks that you're
chosen is you. So shut up already!

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.100
I'm gonna get us out of this thing
if it's the last thing I do.

01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:21.100
That was just my first idea.

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.000
I'm also accepting ideas.

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:27.000
Guard!
The upside down prisoner has to pee!

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:30.200
Oh, I'm peeing.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.200
Oh, no.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.000
Try to keep your mouth closed.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.100
Oh, no. In the nose.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:50.900
Hey, I'm peeing on my face too,
on the inside.

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:52.800
I hate you.

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.300
Observe, my dear...

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.100
...since it was you
who lured him to his death.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.100
"For the crimes of blasphemy...

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.900
...heresy...

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.100
...conspiracy..."

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.700
- What you thinking about?
- "Treachery...

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:21.100
...leprosy..."

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.600
Trying to make conversation.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.400
"Puppetry...

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.200
...hyperbole..."
- Your hair looks really good today.

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:31.400
- I peed all over it.
- Then that's the secret, I guess.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.200
"Sodomy..."

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.600
- Oh, it's "refusal of sodomy."
- Yeah!

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.100
Can you just forgive me?

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:42.900
I think I hate you too much.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.200
"Lechery
and the murder of my brother, Abel."

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.100
- Oh, come on!
- Shut it!

01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:51.500
For these, and other crimes...

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.800
...the prisoners shall be stoned...

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.400
...to death!

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:02.300
- Wait! Can I make a suggestion?
- What?

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.700
Just have one person throw stones
at us.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:11.000
In fact, I think it would be fair if you
let us choose who gets to stone us.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:14.700
No. That doesn't make any...

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.200
- We want that guy.
- That guy.

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.400
- Me?
- That's our stoner.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.600
What, just because I'm a eunuch
you don't think I can throw?

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.800
I'll show you throwing.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.200
No, no. No, no, no! Gross.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:32.700
Did he just hurl his own ball at him?
How spectacular.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.300
No! That doesn't count.
That was a testicle.

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:36.700
I think it counts.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.200
- Pick somebody else.
- What is that idiot doing?

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:42.200
- I pick that guy!
- Nice.

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.000
- This guy?
- No, no, the shorter man.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.100
Right in front of him.

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:47.800
It's a kid. This is a kid.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.600
So? You got something against kids?
This guy hates kids.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.500
- Let me smite him!
- Kid hater!

01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:57.000
- One shot!
- No, they're our future!

01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:59.600
All right. Hey, go ahead and...

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.700
Okay. I'm hit.

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:06.100
Holy shit, that kid's got an arm.

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:08.300
God. There's two of us.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.500
Are you guys happy now?

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:15.800
Okay! Everybody on this side,
on the count of three! One, two...

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Wait! I have a question for the king.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.200
Why didn't I die in the Holy of Holies?

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:32.000
Yes! I entered the Holy of Holies
and, lo, I did not die.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:37.600
Why? Because I was chosen
by the gods!

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:43.200
<i>Spare the chosen one!</i>
<i>Spare the chosen one!</i>

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:47.600
<i>Spare the chosen one!</i>
<i>Spare the chosen one!</i>

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.600
- Spare the chosen one!
- And his friend!

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:53.900
- And his young friend.
- Don't kill either of them.

01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:56.700
Everyone knows
the chosen gets a plus one.

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.800
Is it possible? Is he truly chosen?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.200
Well, of course it's possible.
Highly doubtful.

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.600
Majesty, with respect...

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:08.500
...whether he is chosen or not
is no longer the issue.

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:11.500
If you were to kill him now,
given the public mood...

01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:14.700
...it could inflame the situation
so as...

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:20.200
...to cause a radical regime change.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.900
If you take my meaning.

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:27.600
Yes, that will do.

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:38.100
It is the judgment of our merciful king
that the prisoners be enslaved...

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:44.700
...to toil at hard labor until they die
of starvation or exhaustion!

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:45.900
Yes!

01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.100
And how is that better?

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:02.000
You seem to enjoy your work.
How long have you been a slave?

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.400
Oh, I'm not a slave. I'm a volunteer.

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:10.400
Marlak. Enmebaragesi.
Long time no see.

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.200
I deserve that.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.700
Take these bricks up top.
The masons are waiting.

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:21.700
I would but I did something to my
neck. I think I slept on it funny.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.200
I should probably take it easy,
or I'll be no good for work tomorrow.

01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:27.300
Move!

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.900
You know,
the mud's really good for your skin.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.600
- Yeah.
- Ask me why my skin's so good.

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.100
- Why's your skin...?
- The mud.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:36.700
I knew you were gonna say that.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.700
You gotta love being outside.

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.200
Move it!

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:48.700
Faster!

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:55.700
- Want some water?
- You're from the village, aren't you?

01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:59.200
I'll bet you wish you were back there
right now.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.400
- Yeah.
- Don't give up.

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.200
You'll get home someday.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.000
Who's gonna take him there?
The chosen one?

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.500
You two, up! Get on line. Now.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.000
- Where are we going?
- To watch the sacrifice.

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.700
- The king demands it.
- Is it compulsory?

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:35.000
There was some work that I wanted to
finish doing, get a jump on tomorrow.

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:38.500
I'd like to see how big you are
without that whip.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.400
Same basic size.

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:44.800
All is in readiness, Your Majesty.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
What now?
More virgins to sacrifice?

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:52.800
Yes, two. Your own handmaiden
and another slave.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.900
Followers of the chosen one.
Discovered by this loyal soldier.

01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:00.600
Oh, I was just doing my job.
It's what I do.

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:06.400
And one more to demonstrate
our own faith and charity.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
For the love of the people,
and the heavenly gift of rain...

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.200
...we offer a humble sacrifice:

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.300
our own stepdaughter...

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.200
...the Princess Inanna.

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:27.700
- You're insane.
- For the good of the people, darling.

01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:29.700
- You wouldn't dare.
- Wouldn't I?

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:32.000
If you like,
I can arrange for you to join her.

01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:36.500
Mother.

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:39.300
How long did you think
I would tolerate your insolence?

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.100
Burn her.

01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:51.300
Drink it. You won't feel a thing.

01:21:57.300 --> 01:22:00.300
Are they booing me?
How dare they.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.400
They love you.
They're wooing you.

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:11.800
That's fine. You know?

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:27.700
It's Maya! And Eema!
Wait, Maya's a virgin?

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:28.900
No, don't kill them!

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.700
- Far enough, slave.
- No, kill me! I'm a male virgin.

01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:34.300
Marlak, we can't let them
do this! Eema!

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.300
Eema. Eema!

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
- I gotta get down there.
- Over my dead body.

01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:46.100
- No problem.
- No. Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:52.300
- Thanks, Marlak.
- Now what?

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:56.700
We implore the great gods
to show us a sign...

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:59.100
...so that we may honor
your divine will.

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.100
Take this end. Lower me down.

01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.000
Oh, dear.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.800
Oh, no.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.800
- What is it?
- It's a sign.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.600
The chosen one comes! It's a sign!
He's going to end our suffering!

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.700
Fight the power! Yes, we can!

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:14.400
All together!

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:20.700
Let's cut some foreskins!

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.600
I knew
I could depend upon your loyalty.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.600
Assholes.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:38.800
Burn them. Burn them now.
Burn them all!

01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:41.100
Don't struggle,
it's the will of the gods.

01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:42.500
I don't think so.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.400
Zed!

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.300
Guards!

01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:49.200
- Sorry!
- Stupid.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.600
Ma'am? Okay? All right?
Get the message?

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.700
Okay, we should be safe in here.

01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:58.900
Thank you.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.300
So, Eema, this might be a bad time
to say this...

01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:14.100
...but that stuff
that you saw the other night...

01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:16.500
...with the high priest, that...

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:20.000
He's a friend.
That was totally not a gay thing.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.600
I always thought
that you and I had a connection.

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:33.400
So I just wanted to mention it now.

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.600
I always thought that we had
one and maybe...

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:37.900
...thought you might've
felt the same.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.200
I just wanted to maybe bring it up
and see what you would say.

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.100
But I always thought... I always
have felt a certain way about you.

01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.200
I don't know if you know or not
but you...

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:01.900
All those dead birds
that were always outside of your hut...

01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:03.800
...those were from me.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.200
- Just kiss me.
- From me like a gift for you.

01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:08.700
I don't know,
I thought you'd like those.

01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:18.400
I always thought that you could
maybe use the dead birds...

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:19.800
...in a soup or something.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.400
Or, I don't know,
I thought they were practical.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Should I take off my undercloth?

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.200
Oh, tough guy, huh?
You want a piece of me?

01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:41.000
I'm gonna bash your head in.

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:47.000
That was a nice shot.

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.700
Hey.

01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:54.100
Hey.

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.100
Zed!

01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:08.100
Get up and die like a man.

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:11.200
Nobody harm this woman.
She's not a virgin anymore.

01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:14.800
- He's not either.
- I saved her life with my lovemaking.

01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:19.000
Sit tight, Mama. Daddy's gotta fight.

01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:27.800
Okay. No, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, don't kill him!

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.000
What?

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:32.300
I just had sex with my new girlfriend.

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.500
- So?
- I had to tell somebody. It was great.

01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:38.100
I loved it. I'm hoping
I'm gonna get another opportunity.

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:41.900
- What's going on behind you?
- I'm not falling for that.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.500
Sodomize this!

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.000
Hey, Zed!

01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.200
- Stop! No!
- Get back!

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:06.500
- Let her go!
- No!

01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:08.800
The gods demand a sacrifice.
You're ruining it!

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.200
- How about a little more oil?
- Yes, darling?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.200
I always knew you'd break my heart.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.700
A little hot!

01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:35.800
That was ironic.

01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:45.300
So...

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:47.800
...on behalf of the whole city...

01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:50.800
...l'd like to thank the high priest
for his sacrifice.

01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:53.400
That was really something,
wasn't it?

01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.900
Come on. Put your hands together,
it makes a sound.

01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:18.300
<i>The chosen one! The chosen one!</i>
<i>The chosen one! The chosen one!</i>

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:27.000
Okay, that was a little confusing,
wasn't it?

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:30.000
Was that a sign from the gods?

01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:32.700
Everybody wants to know.

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:36.500
Well, I should know,
because I'm the chosen one, right?

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.800
Yeah!

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:40.900
You respect me.

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.600
Yeah!

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:44.500
You love me.

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:46.300
Yeah!

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.200
You fear me.

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.600
Yeah!

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.500
You would worship me.

01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:54.300
Yeah!

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:57.800
Yeah!

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:07.700
Well, don't.

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:10.400
- Yeah!
- No.

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:13.600
And I'm not saying, "Don't" like,
"I'm the chosen one, so don't."

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:17.000
I'm saying, "Don't"
because I'm not the chosen one.

01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:22.800
I thought I was, but I'm not, sorry.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.900
Turns out I'm just a guy
from the woods...

01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:30.000
...who was lucky enough to have these
great friends to watch my back.

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:35.300
I'm telling you, you don't need me.

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.100
You know what? Maybe we can all
make our own destiny.

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:42.200
Yeah. Maybe we could all
be chosen.

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.000
Yeah.

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:48.200
- You! You could be chosen!
- Yeah!

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:52.100
- And you! And you!
- Yeah!

01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:55.100
Way over in the back! You, little guy!

01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:58.600
Yeah!

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:28.600
- So you're queen.
- Couldn't have done it without you.

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:29.800
Yeah, you could've.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
No, really, I tried for years and...

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:36.600
All right, maybe you couldn't have.
I was pretty amazing with the old...

01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:40.700
Sorry about almost luring you
to your death.

01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:43.400
Oh, please.

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:46.200
All right.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.900
Okay.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.700
See you later.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.400
Come on, people.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.700
- Pick up that bag of camel dung.
- Yes, sir.

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.200
Hang on to it all day.

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.500
Hustle up.
These donkeys don't pack themselves.

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:05.200
- I will kill you where you stand.
- Relax.

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:08.900
They cut a little off the end but there's
plenty more where that came from.

01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:11.600
This is my woman.
Stay away from her, or I'll kill you.

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.800
- Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
- Just go.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.600
Get out of here or I'll kill you.

01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.300
Cranky today.

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:20.700
So are you still thinking
about going to Egypt?

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:23.800
Supposed to be a real happening
place. You coming with or not?

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.300
Well, I mean, I was kind of
planning on going anyway, so...

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:34.000
Let me show you this new style.
Everyone's doing it.

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:37.400
You open your mouth really wide.
It makes it way sexier.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:44.900
I'm thinking about introducing the
tongue, but I haven't perfected it yet.

01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:47.700
- You know, we'll work on that.
- All right.

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:53.900
Look at us. Two men.

01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:57.300
One going to lead a village and
the other going to explore the world.

01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:59.500
You sure you don't wanna come back,
help me?

01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:03.400
You don't need me. Everybody knows
you're the smartest guy in the village.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:06.700
Gonna know you're the most
incredible warrior anyone's ever seen.

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:10.200
The way you punched that lady? Man!

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:11.400
I mean, you know...

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:15.100
She left me no choice, so I had to,
you know, punch her in the face.

01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:19.600
Well, we'll tell stories about you
around the fire.

01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:23.400
Strangers shake hands.
Get that thing out of here.

01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:30.900
- I'm gonna miss you, little guy.
- I'm gonna miss you more.

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:34.300
Just trying to sniff you.
I wanna remember your scent.

01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:37.400
That's probably the urine in my hair.

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.000
I can't let them see me cry.
They respect me too much.

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:48.800
Me too. On three.
One, two, three, break.

01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:54.300
Well, may the gods smile on you.
See you around.

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:56.400
Whatever. Later.

01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:58.200
- Oh?
- What?

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:03.000
I want you to have babies
with my sister.

01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:07.900
- Try and stop me.
- All right, man.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.100
- Zed, may the gods smile on you.
- You said that.

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.200
- May they. Yeah.
- Thank you, though.

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:19.400
All right come on, folks. We're heading
out now because I say so, all right?

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:23.000
What's the deal? Come on, Lindsey.
Come on, everyone's looking.

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:26.500
Please. Go. Good.

01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:28.700
To the north!

01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:32.300
You know that that's west.

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.400
I was just checking to see
if you knew.

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.500
To the west!

01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:39.400
I'm already glad you're here.

01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:02.600
One, two, three, foreskin!

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Invoke your blessing
and do your will.

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.500
What's the fucking line? What is it?

01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:10.600
It was a game.
It was a game of chance...

01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:13.100
...and he hit his head
and he killed himself.

01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:16.300
If anything, it was a suicide.
Okay.

01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:18.500
I let one go.

01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:25.900
In honor of the chosen one,
as my first official act as your queen...

01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:28.200
...l'm going to go back
and say the line again.

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:31.700
- Let's go back. Do you wanna try it?
- Yeah.

01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:33.200
You just want it all.

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:36.000
You want to taste it all
and know it all and feel it all.

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:39.200
And suck it all in and blow it all out
your backside, don't you?

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.000
Sorry.

01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:47.900
It's like the Great Turtle coming out
of the sea, you know?

01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:51.700
It's like with the earth on its back,
you understand?

01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:54.100
I'm an oilman.

01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:58.800
You're cursed, Zed, and if you don't
leave here we're all gonna be cursed.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.400
And it drank up the ocean,
then pooped out the mountains...

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.200
...and the first man
fell from the stars.

01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:08.700
This is... I don't... This doesn't make
a lot of sense, guys.

01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:10.900
Can I talk to Harold?
Is that...?

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:29.600
What's that?

01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:33.700
What's that?
A strange Gorgon from another time!

01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:37.500
I weep for the suffering
of my people.

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:39.600
We're getting boned...

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:42.100
...by the planes, the trains,
and the what, huh?

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.300
Zed?

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:46.300
- Oh, that's great.
- Zed? It's constricting me.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:49.500
Can I show you this new kiss
I been thinking about?

01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:52.900
- Yeah.
- It's called a tongue kiss.

01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:00.400
- It's strange. Yeah. Okay.
- Still perfecting it, yeah.

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:02.900
- It's fine.
- All right.

01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:04.700
What?

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:15.600
And camera reloading!
