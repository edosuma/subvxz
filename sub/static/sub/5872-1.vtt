01:49.246 --> 01:51.406
Can I call you Ticona? Is it all right
if I call you by your first name?

01:51.506 --> 01:54.142
- No.
- Okay.

01:54.242 --> 01:55.944
I came here because I need a job.

01:56.044 --> 01:59.380
So if you could just type my info into your
computer, help a brother out, find me a job.

01:59.480 --> 02:02.183
Something in upper management
would be great. I'll take anything.

02:02.283 --> 02:05.153
I am literally on the verge of having
to move back in with my parents,

02:05.253 --> 02:08.875
- and I don't want to do that.
- Raymond, I got nothing for you.

02:08.975 --> 02:12.043
Moving back in with your parents right now
doesn't sound like such a bad idea.

02:12.143 --> 02:15.410
It does. It really does sound
like a bad idea to me.

02:16.197 --> 02:18.066
I don't know how to say this
without sounding terrible,

02:18.166 --> 02:20.969
but you're the worst guidance
counselor ever.

02:21.069 --> 02:24.439
I got to go. I got to go.
Thank you for everything.

02:25.039 --> 02:26.874
Lose the scarf.

02:26.974 --> 02:28.808
Freak.

02:32.213 --> 02:34.982
I made you a little something
to keep your strength up, Hector.

02:35.082 --> 02:36.851
- My goodness.
- Alberto? Cookies?

02:36.951 --> 02:38.609
- Are those gluten-free?
- No.

02:45.158 --> 02:48.299
All right, now here's the rule.
I just reseeded the lawn.

02:48.399 --> 02:50.665
- Hi.
- I planted some new flowers.

02:51.365 --> 02:52.934
You stay away, you understand?

02:53.034 --> 02:54.619
I won't even look at them, Dad.
How does that sound?

02:54.719 --> 02:55.704
- All right.
- Does that work?

02:55.804 --> 02:59.507
Look, and I'm sorry for being so hard
on you on the phone the other day.

02:59.607 --> 03:02.944
- Hey, you have a thing for black women...
- She was Latino.

03:03.044 --> 03:05.741
You have a thing for Latina black women,

03:05.841 --> 03:07.048
- I'm okay with that.
- Great.

03:07.148 --> 03:09.918
- Your mother and I are very open-minded.
- I've noticed.

03:10.018 --> 03:12.420
- Good?
- Evey, Raymond's home!

03:12.520 --> 03:15.788
I think he's here! He's here!
Oh, he's here!

03:18.492 --> 03:21.000
- Thanks for taking care of my boy.
- I don't know him.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.769
- He's here!
- Mom!

03:24.432 --> 03:26.301
- My beautiful son.
- My beautiful mom.

03:26.401 --> 03:28.069
Oh, honey.

03:28.469 --> 03:31.078
Turn around, let me look at you.

03:33.274 --> 03:35.243
- Oh, wait.
- Mom, are you serious?

03:35.343 --> 03:37.111
- Stop.
- All right.

03:37.211 --> 03:38.880
- So handsome.
- So beautiful.

03:38.980 --> 03:41.294
There is a way you can help your mother
and me while you're here.

03:41.394 --> 03:43.818
- How?
- All those years of education I paid for,

03:43.918 --> 03:45.987
did you ever learn
how to speak any Mexican?

03:46.087 --> 03:48.556
You know, sadly, Dad, I don't know
how to speak Mexican,

03:48.656 --> 03:51.926
because nobody in the world speaks Mexican.
Mexican people speak Spanish.

03:52.026 --> 03:56.347
Mexicans speak Mexican.
People from Spain speak Spanish.

03:56.447 --> 03:57.894
- Come on in, Raymond.
- What are you doing with that flag

03:57.994 --> 04:00.834
- around your neck?
- Celebrating my freedom.

04:00.934 --> 04:04.303
- Good to see you.
- Oh, you too. I'm so happy.

04:05.572 --> 04:08.441
Well, you don't wear the American flag
on your neck. Okay?

04:43.977 --> 04:44.812
Holy shit!

04:44.912 --> 04:47.515
- You scared the fucking shit out of me.
- You scared the fucking shit out of me.

04:47.615 --> 04:51.619
- What are you doing in my bathroom, man?
- Sorry. I just... noth... I just...

04:51.719 --> 04:54.155
I was just checking out
your picture, man.

04:54.255 --> 04:56.324
- Yeah.
- It's a little chubby guy. Remember him?

04:56.424 --> 04:58.612
Yeah, he developed an eating disorder.

04:58.712 --> 05:00.021
- Thanks for bringing it up.
- Well, you look good.

05:00.121 --> 05:03.031
- Thank you.
- I wanted to use the porta-potty outside...

05:03.131 --> 05:07.368
but your father keeps forgetting
the seat covers, you know?

05:07.468 --> 05:09.140
He's an asshole.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.884
- You said it. I didn't. Yeah? Okay?
- I know. All right. Have a good one.

05:11.984 --> 05:14.139
All right. You too.

05:47.908 --> 05:50.811
So, Raymond, I'm going
into town tomorrow.

05:50.911 --> 05:52.245
Would you like to join me?

05:54.014 --> 05:55.877
I'm good.

05:56.117 --> 05:59.985
Oh, honey, of course you're good.
You're my little angel.

06:01.388 --> 06:03.705
But... your father and I
were wondering if...

06:03.805 --> 06:07.334
we could buy you a couple
new outfits for your stay.

06:07.434 --> 06:10.194
Something just
a little less alternative.

06:10.294 --> 06:13.668
Yes. We really care
about you, son, and...

06:13.768 --> 06:18.172
we recognize your more European
approach to fashion...

06:18.272 --> 06:22.108
but we just don't think it's appropriate
here in America. In the U.S. of A.

06:23.510 --> 06:26.029
Well, Dad, I appreciate your concern,

06:26.129 --> 06:28.933
and your criticism of everything
I've ever done in my life,

06:29.033 --> 06:31.152
but I'm gonna have to politely
disagree with you,

06:31.252 --> 06:35.397
based mainly on the fact
that you dress like a drug dealer.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.736
You hear how he talks to me?

06:39.836 --> 06:42.656
That's pretty funny coming from a guy
who graduated business school

06:42.756 --> 06:44.394
six months ago and can't find
a goddamn job.

06:44.494 --> 06:46.603
I'm holding out for a position
in upper management.

06:46.703 --> 06:48.236
Bullshit.

06:48.336 --> 06:51.930
I think we're all just a little tired.
It's been a very big day.

06:52.030 --> 06:55.076
You guys take care of the dishes. I've got
the game's gonna start here in a minute.

06:55.176 --> 06:56.995
And Raymond...

06:57.095 --> 07:01.747
take a shower, okay? You smell
bad enough to gag a maggot.

07:03.316 --> 07:05.586
- How do you gag a maggot?
- I don't know.

07:05.886 --> 07:09.522
You're looking a little thin,
though, Raymond. There.

07:43.775 --> 07:46.534
<i>Hector. Ponte a hacer algo.</i>

07:47.661 --> 07:49.695
<i>Ven, Alberto, apÃºrate. Ven a ayudarnos.</i>

08:17.323 --> 08:18.932
Hello?

08:20.469 --> 08:22.529
Cousin Freddy!
Hey, what are you doing here?

08:22.629 --> 08:25.633
Raymond, thank God.
I thought you were your dad.

08:25.733 --> 08:29.337
Since I came out of the closet,
he's forbidden me to enter the property.

08:30.108 --> 08:32.640
Congratulations. Maybe you never
have to see him ever again.

08:32.740 --> 08:35.275
Well, he's an aries, so...

08:35.376 --> 08:37.884
they're all fucking assholes.

08:37.984 --> 08:39.647
- I didn't know that.
- All of them.

08:39.746 --> 08:42.015
I believe it. I just didn't know it.

08:42.116 --> 08:44.885
So, do you and Mom get to see
much of each other anymore?

08:44.985 --> 08:47.655
Occasionally. You know, whenever
she's in the mood to sneak out

08:47.755 --> 08:50.391
for a night of musical theater,
she calls me.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.326
Sounds nice.

08:52.426 --> 08:55.014
I fucking hate musical theater.

08:55.114 --> 09:01.669
Sorry if I frightened you. I just...
I had to pick up some belongings.

09:08.508 --> 09:11.045
Your mom let me... store my car here

09:11.145 --> 09:15.262
while I'm going through
a transformational period.

09:15.362 --> 09:17.218
Hey, would it be cool
if I borrowed your car?

09:17.318 --> 09:19.320
I was actually just about to go
to a bar and get super drunk.

09:19.420 --> 09:22.006
- Yeah, be my guest.
- Do you want to come with me?

09:22.106 --> 09:24.324
No.

09:24.424 --> 09:28.579
My peace corps application just came
through. I don't want to jeopardize it.

09:28.679 --> 09:31.599
Drinking makes me...

09:32.300 --> 09:34.735
makes me do things...

09:34.835 --> 09:37.616
that I don't remember.

09:38.472 --> 09:40.474
Okay.

09:40.574 --> 09:42.188
Cool.

09:44.510 --> 09:48.815
Are you okay? 'Cause you seem flustered.

09:50.025 --> 09:55.153
Not so good. But... it's nothing
15 or 20 drinks won't fix, you know?

10:03.897 --> 10:07.533
You can't drink that much. You'd die.

10:16.142 --> 10:17.945
Hey. Hey.

10:18.345 --> 10:21.680
- This ain't no public restroom.
- Duly noted.

10:26.986 --> 10:29.557
You are not from around here, are you?

10:29.657 --> 10:33.591
Born and raised, my brother,
but I have since relocated.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.668
What brings you to this shit hole?

10:36.768 --> 10:39.600
Well, the lovely clientele, primarily.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.870
And I also read somewhere that they
serve a scrumptious Cosmopolitan.

10:42.970 --> 10:45.940
- And I myself...
- Holy shit!

10:46.040 --> 10:48.509
I fucking know you.

10:48.609 --> 10:52.480
I used to take the bus to school with
this kid. He used to be fatter than shit.

10:52.580 --> 10:55.716
You used to be fatter than shit.
What happened?

10:56.116 --> 10:58.452
Well, as you put it,
I was fat as shit...

10:58.552 --> 11:01.288
Fatter than shit. Fatter than shit.

11:01.388 --> 11:03.357
Fatter than shit.
Thank you for correcting me.

11:03.457 --> 11:06.160
And then the weirdest thing happened.
It's like, I moved away from this town

11:06.260 --> 11:07.995
and all the people
that live within this town,

11:08.095 --> 11:11.532
and then suddenly I had to stop using eating
as coping mechanism for depression.

11:11.632 --> 11:13.734
So weird. Thinned out. Who knew?

11:13.834 --> 11:15.770
Are you still into that paranormal shit?

11:15.870 --> 11:19.173
Not professionally. But I do still
kind of practice it as a hobby.

11:19.273 --> 11:22.710
I don't believe that modern science has
all the answers. Do you guys? Anyone?

11:23.410 --> 11:28.032
I always figured you just disappeared.
You started a cult or something.

11:28.132 --> 11:31.319
Thanks. Guess I've just never really
seen myself as being that ambitious.

11:31.419 --> 11:33.020
What are you up to? Just drugs?

11:33.120 --> 11:36.723
I used to love kicking the shit
out of this faggot here.

11:36.971 --> 11:40.760
Yeah, that was great. That was really
fun, man. Yeah, that was really cool.

11:40.860 --> 11:44.398
- But then you had me expelled.
- Did I, though? I don't know.

11:44.498 --> 11:47.201
You know what? In fact...

11:47.301 --> 11:49.336
I think this faggot here
deserves an ass kicking.

11:49.436 --> 11:51.772
No, I think you're thinking
of a different faggot.

11:51.872 --> 11:54.842
- Honestly, I think you're thinking of...
- Lay off him, Pope.

11:54.942 --> 11:57.111
If you're gonna bother my customers,
you have to leave.

11:57.211 --> 12:00.045
Well, I was just leaving anyway, Becca.

12:01.214 --> 12:03.483
I'll be seeing you around.

12:11.325 --> 12:15.329
- Parents wonder why I ever left.
- Drink your beer and stop being a bitch.

12:15.429 --> 12:17.199
Okay.

12:20.133 --> 12:21.736
You don't remember me, do you?

12:24.572 --> 12:26.040
No, I don't.

12:26.140 --> 12:28.809
Becca Thompson.
We went to school together.

12:30.209 --> 12:32.346
Guacamole. Becca Thompson.

12:32.446 --> 12:34.915
- You... you...
- Say it.

12:35.215 --> 12:37.184
You lost a lot of weight.
You look really good.

12:37.284 --> 12:40.852
Thanks. Looks like we both
lost a lot of weight.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.091
Raymond.

12:43.191 --> 12:45.859
I'm gonna have to ask you
to stop staring at my tits.

12:45.959 --> 12:48.028
You're the only guy to come
through town in a long time

12:48.128 --> 12:49.930
that I'd consider sleeping with,
and you're ruining it.

12:50.230 --> 12:52.967
I was actually admiring
the tips of your hair,

12:53.067 --> 12:54.968
but I will not do that anymore.

12:55.068 --> 12:57.605
I'll look you right in the eyes.
What are you still doing in town?

12:58.305 --> 13:01.342
Well, most of you assholes left,
and I figured if all of us left,

13:01.442 --> 13:03.544
nothing around here would ever change.

13:03.644 --> 13:07.026
The real question is
what are you doing here?

13:07.126 --> 13:09.083
- Hector, my friend...
- Who's this fucking asshole?

13:09.183 --> 13:12.253
Maybe you should start thinking about...

13:12.953 --> 13:16.023
selling your construction company
and getting back behind a mower.

13:16.123 --> 13:19.460
Yeah, you really missed your calling,
Donald, I got to tell you.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.797
Yeah, no, I'm trying to distance myself
from that stereotype at the moment.

13:22.897 --> 13:26.187
- Â¿CÃ³mo se llama? What's your name?
- <i>Mi nombre es</i>...

13:26.287 --> 13:29.337
The other Mexican that's underpaid.
Dude, where's your sense of humor?

13:29.437 --> 13:31.739
Get out of here. I want to talk
to your El bosso here.

13:31.839 --> 13:34.279
- You said you were gonna be finished today.
- I did. But here's...

13:34.379 --> 13:36.296
My wife was counting on that.
She's on my ass in there.

13:36.396 --> 13:37.611
I get it. Here's the thing.

13:37.711 --> 13:40.981
I've never seen, in my 20 years
of doing this, Donald,

13:41.081 --> 13:45.886
so many equipment malfunctions.
I mean, it's really... it's fucking weird.

13:45.986 --> 13:50.324
I got to tell you. The guys think the
property's cursed. I'm dealing with that.

13:50.424 --> 13:53.369
Well, that's pretty goddamn superstitious
for a Mexican who doesn't want to fall

13:53.469 --> 13:55.633
- into a stereotype.
- Yeah. It is, isn't it?

13:55.733 --> 13:56.947
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:57.047 --> 13:59.984
Anyways, look, here's what
I might be able to do.

14:00.623 --> 14:03.352
If you can help me out here,
I might be able to talk them

14:03.452 --> 14:06.073
- into working through the night.
- Yeah?

14:06.473 --> 14:09.210
- If you can sweeten the pot a little bit.
- Oh, Christ.

14:09.310 --> 14:12.580
- How's $2,000 sound?
- $3,000 sounds better.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.049
- $3,000 and...
- It's a deal.

14:15.149 --> 14:16.283
One more thing.

14:16.483 --> 14:19.719
- "Suck my dick."
- Terrible, right?

14:20.132 --> 14:21.911
It's a choice.

14:22.011 --> 14:25.025
These lesbian bikers talked me
into joining their metal band.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.194
"Suck my dick" was our mantra.

14:27.294 --> 14:29.496
Cool mantra. I'd love to catch
a show while I'm in town.

14:29.596 --> 14:33.200
- Are you guys playing any time soon?
- We're on a permanent hiatus.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.003
I think I might have something that'll
make you feel better about your tattoo.

14:40.506 --> 14:44.078
"Trust no one"? I'm probably
not gonna sleep with you anymore.

14:44.478 --> 14:45.979
I understand.

14:46.079 --> 14:49.850
- You just dug yourself a vagina grave.
- I do that a lot.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.986
So, you still believe
in all that paranormal stuff?

14:53.086 --> 14:56.455
Believe in it?
I've experienced it firsthand.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.631
Frank. Frank.

15:13.206 --> 15:15.040
Come on.

15:16.142 --> 15:18.012
Well...

15:18.112 --> 15:20.137
there he is.

15:20.613 --> 15:24.849
Your grandfather.
He was one real son of a bitch.

15:25.501 --> 15:27.477
Right, Daddy?

15:40.167 --> 15:41.519
- No shit?
- It's weird.

15:41.619 --> 15:45.338
I used to see ghosts regularly,
and then just suddenly it stopped.

15:45.438 --> 15:46.507
I feel like, as I've grown older,

15:46.607 --> 15:48.776
I've unfortunately become
less sensitive to the spirit world.

15:48.876 --> 15:50.744
Sounds like you have an amazing gift.

15:50.844 --> 15:52.713
Why don't you pursue a career
in the paranormal?

15:52.813 --> 15:55.981
My dad threatened to disown me
unless I went to business school.

15:56.782 --> 16:00.387
I should actually probably stop. Alcohol
interferes with my blood-pressure medication.

16:00.487 --> 16:02.289
Drink it.

16:02.489 --> 16:05.023
To parents knowing what's best.

16:08.027 --> 16:10.196
All right, we're working
through the night.

16:10.296 --> 16:12.399
What? What do you mean
we're working through the night?

16:12.499 --> 16:15.436
Just keep digging like I said.
I'm trying to avoid a lawsuit, man.

16:15.536 --> 16:19.504
- Just keep digging. Please?
- You got to be fucking kidding me.

16:21.709 --> 16:25.276
- Well, that's hollow.
- Watch out.

16:27.813 --> 16:29.497
Hold up a sec.

16:38.257 --> 16:40.091
What the fuck?

16:40.827 --> 16:42.626
Who?

16:43.295 --> 16:44.999
It's like a girl or something.

16:45.699 --> 16:49.136
- Will you do me a favor? See if it's...
- Hey, man, don't touch it. Don't touch it.

16:49.236 --> 16:51.305
- What are you talking about?
- Hey, man, we got to report this.

16:51.405 --> 16:55.642
No, I'm not reporting shit.
What, five Mexicans and a fucking dead kid?

16:55.742 --> 16:56.710
- What?
- Cover that shit up.

16:56.810 --> 16:58.879
- This is not okay.
- Just cover it up.

16:58.979 --> 17:02.649
- We can't just leave this body here.
- Fucking cover it up.

17:02.749 --> 17:07.056
Cover it up. I know how
that story ends. Fuck that.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.711
You guys suck!

18:13.218 --> 18:16.456
Raymond, I'm gonna give you a ride home.

18:16.556 --> 18:18.632
Give me the keys.

18:23.063 --> 18:24.364
What's that?

18:24.464 --> 18:27.301
Pain-killer.
In case we get into an accident.

18:27.401 --> 18:29.941
Doesn't that strike you
as counterintuitive?

18:30.837 --> 18:32.470
Nope.

18:54.427 --> 18:55.963
Hello?

18:56.063 --> 18:58.998
- Go see who's out there.
- You go see who's out there.

18:59.098 --> 19:02.069
- You're bigger than me.
- Jesus Christ.

19:02.669 --> 19:05.203
Donald, man, I know it's you.

19:10.109 --> 19:11.731
Who's there?

19:12.044 --> 19:14.081
I told you guys, it's...

19:14.481 --> 19:16.510
Holy shit!

19:17.517 --> 19:18.819
Where you going?

19:22.088 --> 19:23.590
Get in the truck!

19:23.690 --> 19:26.460
- Let's go.
- Alberto.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.061
Come on, let's go.

19:28.161 --> 19:30.096
Alberto.

19:30.196 --> 19:33.731
Alberto, man, where are you going?

19:35.201 --> 19:36.770
You shouldn't have opened
that fucking box.

19:36.870 --> 19:41.074
It's fucking Donald playing tricks.
I told you already.

19:41.274 --> 19:43.243
- It's not Donald. It's not Donald.
- But...

19:43.343 --> 19:46.072
Come on, come on. I got a job to finish.
Don't take my guys away.

19:46.172 --> 19:49.733
- Hey, finish it yourself.
- I hate you so much.

19:49.833 --> 19:51.835
Fucking asshole.

19:52.385 --> 19:54.256
Hey, Hector?

19:55.321 --> 19:59.557
- What?
- Fuck you! I quit!

20:20.513 --> 20:24.482
Come on. I see you back there.

20:35.195 --> 20:37.397
What are you pulling, man?

20:50.643 --> 20:52.721
That was rough.

20:52.821 --> 20:54.948
I think I'm developing night blindness.

20:55.048 --> 20:57.682
I think it might have been
the pain-killer.

20:58.150 --> 20:59.927
So...

21:00.819 --> 21:03.724
you want to... you want to come in?

21:03.824 --> 21:05.859
I'm on my period.

21:06.159 --> 21:08.193
No, you're not.

21:09.528 --> 21:11.999
You know what? I'm not.

21:12.099 --> 21:15.366
I just really don't want
to have sex right now.

21:15.768 --> 21:18.002
Neither do I.

21:20.205 --> 21:21.973
Bye.

23:00.605 --> 23:04.544
Well, you'd think with all the maid
services these people run,

23:04.644 --> 23:08.048
they'd know how to clean up
after themselves.

23:08.348 --> 23:10.450
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

23:10.550 --> 23:13.270
Hector and his crew ran off in the middle
of the night without finishing the job.

23:13.370 --> 23:14.588
That's what's going on.

23:14.688 --> 23:17.924
I'm just shocked that Hector
would do something like this.

23:18.024 --> 23:20.126
- It's not like him.
- I second that.

23:20.226 --> 23:22.496
It's not like a Mexican
to run off without getting paid.

23:22.596 --> 23:25.598
Hey, were they still here
when you got home?

23:25.698 --> 23:29.068
- Honey? Are you okay?
- He's hung over.

23:29.168 --> 23:33.707
Raymond. Excessively drinking
with your high blood pressure?

23:33.807 --> 23:36.075
Raymond, you're pathetic.

23:36.175 --> 23:38.454
Have I ever told you that?

23:43.816 --> 23:45.785
And bless this food.

23:45.885 --> 23:47.286
- Amen.
- Amen.

23:47.386 --> 23:50.791
Amen. Dad, for someone who doesn't believe
in ghosts, you really do pray a lot.

23:50.891 --> 23:54.694
- Hey, Mom, can you pass the syrup?
- Oh, sure, honey.

23:54.794 --> 23:57.864
Yes, your mother and I
sent you off to the big city,

23:57.964 --> 24:01.201
- and you came back an alcoholic.
- I'm not an alcoholic.

24:01.301 --> 24:03.370
Of course, if I dressed like you,
I might have to have a few drinks

24:03.470 --> 24:06.540
- before I walked out of the house, too.
- Oh, good, so you understand.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.075
You know, if I had the hair like you,
I'd part it on the other side.

24:09.175 --> 24:11.609
Boys, stop it.

24:12.778 --> 24:16.783
So, I was thinking that I may organize
a search party for Hector.

24:16.883 --> 24:20.753
Hector's not missing, Evey.
He's just a lazy Mexican piece of shit.

24:20.853 --> 24:23.924
Hey, Mom, can I get a ride to my car?
I left it at the bar last night.

24:24.024 --> 24:26.626
Honey, you really shouldn't be
driving that car on the road.

24:26.726 --> 24:28.361
The tags expired years ago.

24:28.461 --> 24:30.096
Yeah, not to mention the fact
that that car

24:30.196 --> 24:32.365
belonged to your mother's cousin
Freddy, the faggot.

24:32.465 --> 24:34.400
Don't use that word, Donald.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.569
I also need to refill my prescription.

24:36.669 --> 24:38.747
- I'll let Dr. Carpenter know.
- Thanks.

24:38.847 --> 24:41.441
You're not going anywhere till you
clean up that mess in the backyard.

24:41.541 --> 24:43.346
Are you serious?

24:43.446 --> 24:46.977
- Don't I look serious?
- Yeah.

24:47.646 --> 24:52.083
It would be a nice thing to do, Raymond.
Your father doesn't ask much.

24:54.154 --> 24:56.144
It's so good to have you home, honey.

24:57.123 --> 24:59.058
It's great to be home.

24:59.158 --> 25:02.160
Cool. I'll go clean up
the yard, I guess.

25:33.626 --> 25:35.361
Hey.

25:35.461 --> 25:37.047
- What's up?
- Have you seen Hector?

25:37.147 --> 25:38.765
Yeah. He's inside taking a catnap
and watching cable TV.

25:38.865 --> 25:42.702
No, I haven't seen Hector! He vanished.
That's why I'm out here doing this work.

25:42.802 --> 25:46.272
- Hey, nice ascot.
- Thanks. Fuck!

25:46.372 --> 25:48.759
- Don't fucking talk to me like that.
- Sorry, man. I just...

25:48.859 --> 25:52.028
- I don't work for you. I work for Hector.
- Okay, I understand. I'm sorry.

25:52.128 --> 25:54.514
Good. Look, you need
to get out of this place, man.

25:54.614 --> 25:57.317
- I know, I hate it here.
- No, seriously, all right?

25:57.417 --> 25:58.751
You got to get out of this place.

25:58.851 --> 26:01.716
There's some crazy shit
happening here, all right?

26:01.816 --> 26:03.943
- Like what?
- Like yesterday while we were digging,

26:04.043 --> 26:08.545
we found a creepy wooden box over there.
Hector, he opened it. It wasn't me.

26:08.645 --> 26:11.298
- What was in the box?
- It was, like, a creepy dead girl's,

26:11.398 --> 26:12.933
like, carcass with a nightie.

26:13.033 --> 26:15.268
- Are you fucking kidding me now?
- No! Look...

26:15.368 --> 26:17.237
You found a dead girl buried
in my dad's backyard?

26:17.337 --> 26:19.172
I hate to break it to you, all right?

26:19.272 --> 26:22.175
There is an evil spirit
lurking on your property,

26:22.275 --> 26:25.881
and I don't want to fucking be here
when it shows up, so I'm out, all right?

26:25.981 --> 26:28.533
That makes sense. Honestly, all day
something's been feeling a little bit off.

26:28.633 --> 26:31.184
- I thought I just had a hangover.
- No, dude. Wake the fuck up!

26:31.284 --> 26:33.903
I only came here
to fucking raid your fridge,

26:34.003 --> 26:36.255
get my fanny pack,
and warn you, that's it.

26:36.355 --> 26:39.624
- Thank you, man. I really appreciate it.
- Good luck.

26:43.562 --> 26:46.264
Sit down. Right here.

26:49.334 --> 26:52.372
Now... here we go.

26:52.889 --> 26:57.008
All right. Let's do this thing.

26:57.943 --> 26:59.713
Good.

26:59.913 --> 27:01.893
Since when do you make house calls?

27:01.993 --> 27:05.585
Since they gave me the opportunity
to charge you more money.

27:05.985 --> 27:07.087
Fair enough.

27:07.987 --> 27:11.557
So, is your dad here?

27:11.657 --> 27:15.028
- He actually died today.
- Good news.

27:15.328 --> 27:19.032
- I'm just kidding. He's at work.
- Bad news, 'cause he's a dick.

27:19.132 --> 27:21.401
Your father is a scoundrel.
He is a cheater.

27:21.501 --> 27:23.603
And he owes me a lot of money.

27:23.703 --> 27:27.206
My brother, you are preaching
to the choir on that one.

27:28.606 --> 27:30.693
My thing is, I kind of stay
out of other people's business,

27:30.793 --> 27:33.847
so maybe... if you could just give me
my prescription, we could...

27:33.947 --> 27:35.982
You know what?

27:36.382 --> 27:38.685
You don't need
your prescription anymore.

27:38.785 --> 27:43.189
You're perfectly healthy.
Your condition has corrected itself.

27:43.289 --> 27:45.692
All right, let me... let me just
get this straight for the record.

27:45.792 --> 27:50.330
You're saying that... the blood-pressure
condition I've had for the last 15 years,

27:50.430 --> 27:54.501
and been on medication for,
has just magically corrected itself?

27:54.601 --> 27:56.753
- Basically, yes.
- If you're trying to get back at my dad

27:56.853 --> 28:00.540
by killing me, I don't think it's gonna work.
The guy... the guy really hates me.

28:00.740 --> 28:04.277
Raymond, I have been your physician
since you were born. I circumcised you.

28:04.377 --> 28:09.515
There's no sort of game being played here.
You've simply outgrown your condition.

28:09.615 --> 28:11.651
Simple as that.

28:11.851 --> 28:13.765
Happens all the time.

28:19.924 --> 28:22.760
I got to get the fuck out of this town.

28:23.963 --> 28:27.601
Well, at least aerobics class will help
take my mind off Hector's disappearance.

28:28.863 --> 28:31.938
Come to think of it, honey, your old friend
David's mom will be there tonight.

28:32.038 --> 28:33.373
Mom, what are you talking about?

28:33.473 --> 28:36.040
Once a week, several of us
get together for a group workout.

28:36.140 --> 28:38.946
No, I mean... Dave Richards?
I'm not friends with that guy, Mom.

28:39.046 --> 28:42.282
- He's a total scumbag.
- Oh, honey, shush.

28:42.382 --> 28:45.118
His mother says he's working
for the school district now.

28:45.218 --> 28:47.787
I think teaching
is such a noble profession.

28:47.887 --> 28:50.723
Teaching is a noble profession, Mom.
But did his mom tell you also about how...

28:50.823 --> 28:53.455
and I don't like using this language
in front of you, but he fingered a girl

28:53.555 --> 28:55.920
who was asleep on the back of the bus,
and she didn't even know about it.

28:56.020 --> 28:58.329
Allegedly fingered her.

28:59.397 --> 29:02.709
- What are you doing? Stop! Stop, stop!
- Oh, stop. It's that cute little cowlick.

29:02.809 --> 29:05.974
I know, it's... it took like an hour
to get it like this. Don't touch it.

29:06.074 --> 29:08.463
- What is this?
- We're stopping at the school first.

29:08.563 --> 29:10.510
Can't have your father
starving now, can we?

29:10.610 --> 29:12.443
God forbid.

29:16.749 --> 29:20.120
I don't care what your policy is.
He signed a contract.

29:20.420 --> 29:22.988
You have to fucking tip him?

29:23.088 --> 29:25.169
How's the lawn look?

29:25.690 --> 29:28.794
I'm having trouble taking the exam
with all these distractions.

29:28.894 --> 29:32.020
Pumpkin, if you want to start taking
your exams in the quiet room

29:32.120 --> 29:35.735
with all the special-ed students, I'm gonna
need to see a note from your doctor.

29:36.135 --> 29:39.903
Nice pants. My sister has the same ones.

29:40.874 --> 29:42.541
Hello? Yes.

29:42.641 --> 29:44.778
Will you slow down, please?
I can't understand what you're saying.

29:45.378 --> 29:50.016
Well, you tell him to call me
the second he returns, <i>comprende</i> ?

29:50.116 --> 29:51.650
<i>Gracias.</i>

29:51.750 --> 29:53.759
What was that about?

29:54.853 --> 29:56.421
Take a knee.

30:07.599 --> 30:10.604
Hector has been missing
since last night.

30:11.504 --> 30:14.398
Dad, I think something weird's going on.
One of his workers came by

30:14.498 --> 30:16.341
- this morning looking for him.
- Yeah?

30:16.441 --> 30:19.012
He said they found some kind of,
like, box buried in the yard.

30:19.112 --> 30:21.180
- Do you know anything about this?
- What?

30:21.280 --> 30:23.781
Those fucking <i>putas</i>.

30:24.382 --> 30:25.718
Did you tell your mother about this?

30:25.818 --> 30:29.087
- No.
- Don't. You know how she gets.

30:30.790 --> 30:32.824
All right, get out of here.

30:33.175 --> 30:34.894
Time's up.

30:34.994 --> 30:37.019
Exams on the desk.

30:50.042 --> 30:52.311
- Start where we left off
- Sure.

30:52.411 --> 30:54.261
- Hey, how late are you working tonight?
- Why?

30:54.361 --> 30:56.816
My mom and her friends are getting together
at the house for a group workout,

30:56.916 --> 30:59.969
and I was thinking maybe
we could hang out.

31:00.069 --> 31:01.704
Sounds terrible.

31:02.643 --> 31:05.258
Us hanging out or my mom
working out with her friends?

31:05.358 --> 31:07.404
Us hanging out.

31:07.804 --> 31:10.361
Yeah. I agree.

31:11.496 --> 31:13.949
Guess what? Dave Richards' mom
is gonna be there tonight.

31:14.049 --> 31:16.853
Didn't he finger some girl on the bus
while she was asleep?

31:16.953 --> 31:18.781
Allegedly.

31:21.773 --> 31:24.978
Yeah. Anyway, I guess he's doing
really good for himself.

31:25.078 --> 31:27.447
So I guess it pays
to finger girls on buses.

31:27.547 --> 31:29.449
Dave Richards used to go
to parties in high school

31:29.549 --> 31:33.486
- with a condom on his dick just in case.
- I bet that was a big hit with the girls.

31:33.586 --> 31:35.421
Only me.

31:35.721 --> 31:39.390
Listen, I've got drum practice tonight,
so... maybe another time.

31:42.093 --> 31:43.943
Cool.

31:45.664 --> 31:50.601
And I give the bitch a skosh of chloroform
and all of the sudden, I'm the bad guy.

31:52.704 --> 31:55.107
What's up, faggot?

31:55.207 --> 31:57.596
Yo. What's up, dudes?

31:59.678 --> 32:01.447
Cool shirts.

32:01.547 --> 32:05.184
Hey, look, I'm really dehydrated right now
and I don't want any trouble.

32:05.284 --> 32:09.355
Seriously? Well, there's three of us
and only one of you,

32:09.455 --> 32:12.492
and we don't give a fuck
what you want, so...

32:12.892 --> 32:14.694
The good news is, I'm gonna be
in town for a while.

32:14.794 --> 32:19.497
So if you want to take the day off
from threatening me, that... Carl!

32:21.033 --> 32:25.518
Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.
Let him go. He's pretty fucked up.

32:36.848 --> 32:39.151
- Raymond, pop the trunk.
- What?

32:39.251 --> 32:41.284
Pop the trunk!

32:45.508 --> 32:46.993
I thought you shipped off
to the peace corps.

32:47.093 --> 32:49.998
I'm shipping out tonight.
I had to get my shit.

32:51.196 --> 32:53.563
I'm glad I'm seeing you 'cause...

32:54.400 --> 32:56.502
Ever since I saw you last time,

32:56.602 --> 32:59.906
I've had this really bad feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

33:00.406 --> 33:02.842
- What do you mean?
- You know, you just...

33:02.942 --> 33:06.612
you seem really distraught and confused.

33:06.712 --> 33:09.148
You know, and I just want you to know...

33:09.248 --> 33:12.652
- I've been there.
- Cool. Thanks. I... Thank you.

33:12.752 --> 33:16.456
You got to take a good, long, honest
look at yourself in the mirror, you know,

33:16.556 --> 33:19.976
and just... and just say to yourself,
"I'm okay with this," you know?

33:20.076 --> 33:21.861
- Say, "I love myself.
- I'm okay like this.

33:21.961 --> 33:23.496
- It's about acceptance.
- Okay.

33:23.596 --> 33:26.015
- Can I ask you a question?
- It gets better.

33:26.115 --> 33:28.528
I really don't know what you're talking
about right now, but I'm agreeing with you

33:28.628 --> 33:33.473
- kind of just to be polite.
- 'Cause... 'cause you're gay.

33:34.073 --> 33:37.426
- N... no, I... No, I'm not. I'm not.
- Really?

33:37.526 --> 33:40.780
- Yeah. Not gay. Straight.
- 'Cause you seem so gay.

33:40.880 --> 33:44.183
- Well, I take it as a compliment.
- What is with you? Why are you so sad?

33:44.283 --> 33:47.153
If I tell you, do you promise
you won't make fun of me?

33:47.453 --> 33:49.222
- I never know.
- You never know.

33:49.322 --> 33:53.092
Ever since I've been back home,
I've been having these flashbacks

33:53.192 --> 33:55.645
to, like, spirits that I used
to see when I was a kid,

33:55.745 --> 33:59.349
coupled with, like, strange,
supernatural sensations.

33:59.799 --> 34:01.866
- Oh, my G...
- You okay?

34:04.035 --> 34:05.904
You okay?

34:06.004 --> 34:08.467
Give me a second. Just...

34:19.016 --> 34:22.688
- I see things, too. Don't tell anybody.
- Are you serious?

34:22.789 --> 34:25.558
I think you're seeing spirits that haven't
crossed over to the other side.

34:25.658 --> 34:27.161
No, but I'm not seeing ghosts.
I'm not seeing anything.

34:27.262 --> 34:29.896
- I'm just have strange...
- That doesn't matter.

34:29.996 --> 34:32.665
From the sound of it,
you're going to see them.

34:32.764 --> 34:34.333
They're reaching out to you,
and when they do,

34:34.434 --> 34:36.735
you're gonna have to figure out
what they want.

34:36.835 --> 34:39.371
This sounds like a major inconvenience.

34:39.471 --> 34:41.873
Oh, you have no idea. You have no idea.

34:41.974 --> 34:44.543
Ghosts only communicate
when they want something.

34:44.643 --> 34:47.880
And they can visit you
in any form they want.

34:47.980 --> 34:51.208
I mean, they can be a man, a woman.
It could be human,

34:51.309 --> 34:53.440
it could be a horrible monster.

34:55.553 --> 34:59.557
Get off the car. Get off the car.
Get in the car. Get in the car.

35:00.825 --> 35:02.526
Okay.

35:03.561 --> 35:06.255
Now, this...

35:06.632 --> 35:10.135
this is an evil-eye pendant.

35:10.235 --> 35:12.105
Okay? It's gotten me out
of a lot of hairy situations.

35:12.205 --> 35:14.207
I want you to use it
to protect yourself.

35:14.307 --> 35:16.640
- Okay.
- Here.

35:19.744 --> 35:23.249
Always use protection.

35:23.349 --> 35:25.250
Okay?

35:25.350 --> 35:27.587
- Yeah.
- Don't just... put it in your pocket.

35:27.687 --> 35:30.606
- Oh, yeah.
- Don't lose it.

35:30.706 --> 35:33.993
And lunge. Lunge. Lunge.

35:34.093 --> 35:37.889
And, yes, yes. Okay.

35:38.497 --> 35:41.367
And up. And up. And bring it down.

35:41.467 --> 35:44.487
And down. And down. And down.

35:52.945 --> 35:56.882
Hey, Dad. You're a total fucking creep.

35:56.982 --> 35:59.052
And that's a fact.

36:00.953 --> 36:05.725
Raymond! Come in. Come here, honey.
Look, it's Mrs. Richards.

36:05.825 --> 36:09.014
Look at you! Oh, my God, all fancy,

36:09.114 --> 36:13.182
coming down from the big city
to grace us with your presence.

36:13.282 --> 36:17.703
Oh, yeah, and your mom tells me
you're looking for work.

36:17.803 --> 36:20.939
Yep. Looking for work. Can't find a job.

36:21.039 --> 36:23.643
- Thanks for bringing that up.
- Honey, it's networking.

36:24.443 --> 36:27.400
You know, I can't put my finger on it,
but just the other day,

36:27.500 --> 36:30.215
someone was telling me that Dave's
doing really good. You must be proud.

36:30.315 --> 36:33.186
I am so proud. Hey, wait. Look at this.

36:33.686 --> 36:36.355
Check this out. Here's my handsome man.

36:36.455 --> 36:40.726
So fucking handsome. And you know what
I've always found most handsome about him?

36:40.826 --> 36:43.095
- His thick fingers.
- Excuse me?

36:43.195 --> 36:46.699
Very thick fingers.
I've always been envious.

36:46.849 --> 36:49.935
- You know, he's a teacher now.
- Oh, really? A teacher?

36:50.035 --> 36:54.874
It has given him such...
direction, focus, purpose.

36:54.974 --> 36:56.576
Direction, focus, and purpose.
What more could you want?

36:56.676 --> 36:58.464
- And..
- Hold on...

36:58.564 --> 37:00.626
Do you hear that? I got to go.

37:01.146 --> 37:03.592
Okay, look. I know...
I know, I have to talk to you.

37:03.692 --> 37:06.752
- There is something wrong with him.
- He's just really sensitive, honey.

37:06.852 --> 37:09.589
- So, break's over, ladies.
- Okay.

37:09.689 --> 37:12.291
- Hop to it!
- Let's go. And, go!

37:12.391 --> 37:14.624
And up. And do it.

39:24.957 --> 39:26.692
Mom!

39:26.892 --> 39:28.027
- Raymond!
- What?

39:28.127 --> 39:30.700
- What are you screaming about?
- There's something in the drain!

39:30.800 --> 39:32.443
What?

39:32.543 --> 39:36.202
- Hey, did you eat my ice-cream cake?
- Donald.

39:36.302 --> 39:37.870
Raymond?

39:37.970 --> 39:41.613
- Did you?
- Yeah, I did.

39:42.174 --> 39:44.076
He did. He ate it.

39:44.476 --> 39:48.247
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Yeah, he did. I knew it. I knew it.

39:48.347 --> 39:49.748
- God damn it.
- Donald...

39:49.848 --> 39:52.551
Raymond, you know how much
I love that ice-cream cake.

39:52.651 --> 39:54.891
Donald. Honey, you're not even...

39:54.991 --> 39:57.521
What are you screaming all over
the goddamn place for all the time?

40:03.427 --> 40:06.275
- Did you find anything?
- Did I not warn you...

40:06.375 --> 40:08.033
not to get your mother worked up?

40:08.133 --> 40:10.608
Dad, there was somebody or something
in my room. You have to believe me.

40:10.708 --> 40:13.305
Something? Somebody?

40:13.405 --> 40:15.774
No, there's nothing!

40:15.874 --> 40:18.264
- There's nothing in this room!
- Dad, I saw it with my own eyes.

40:18.364 --> 40:21.113
- Nothing! There never was.
- There was.

40:21.413 --> 40:24.416
Your mother and I are starting
to worry about you, son.

40:24.516 --> 40:26.452
There's a history
of schizophrenia in our family.

40:26.552 --> 40:28.754
- Who has schizophrenia?
- Well, you caught me in a lie there.

40:28.854 --> 40:32.191
- No, there's no schizophrenia in our family.
- Why would you make that up?

40:32.291 --> 40:35.661
I'm just trying to make a point.
You're acting like a paranoid schizophrenic.

40:35.761 --> 40:38.028
And I want it to stop!

40:39.230 --> 40:42.032
You get your shit together.

41:18.070 --> 41:19.405
Hey.

41:20.005 --> 41:22.507
What's wrong with the bed in your room?

41:24.776 --> 41:29.046
I was kind of uncomfortable up there,
so I thought I'd sleep down here

41:29.146 --> 41:31.249
where it's comfortable.

41:32.717 --> 41:34.226
I think I'm just...

41:34.326 --> 41:37.155
I'm just stressing myself out
with this job search, you know?

41:37.255 --> 41:39.492
Well, you have to learn
how to handle that.

41:39.592 --> 41:44.062
Stress management is a very important
component in success in business.

41:44.162 --> 41:45.797
- It really is.
- Yeah.

41:46.764 --> 41:48.834
What the hell?

41:48.934 --> 41:51.537
- What happened to your arm?
- I don't know.

41:51.637 --> 41:54.907
Your mother must have
scratched me in her sleep.

41:55.507 --> 42:00.836
I think I got one on my scrotum, too.
She wasn't anywhere near it.

42:41.118 --> 42:43.956
I don't know who or what you are,

42:44.056 --> 42:47.991
but I'm really, really sorry
that you were disturbed.

42:48.926 --> 42:51.547
So what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna give you a proper burial.

42:51.647 --> 42:52.960
And in return,

42:53.060 --> 42:56.402
I would really appreciate it if you would
just cross over to the other side

42:56.502 --> 42:59.271
and leave me and my family alone.

42:59.371 --> 43:02.138
This is a really bad time
for a haunting.

43:16.320 --> 43:20.125
Longstreet Ranch...

43:20.225 --> 43:22.898
1860.

43:46.150 --> 43:49.183
Well, I tried.

44:30.627 --> 44:33.931
What the... fuck?

45:01.393 --> 45:03.646
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

45:03.746 --> 45:05.693
Oh, man.

45:13.003 --> 45:14.804
Fuck!

45:17.776 --> 45:20.175
Mom, Dad, I was...

45:24.015 --> 45:25.883
masturbating.

45:30.855 --> 45:33.323
Be careful, darling.

45:40.831 --> 45:42.699
Hello?

46:36.554 --> 46:38.379
You know...

46:40.025 --> 46:44.637
When your mother worries about you,
I never hear the end of it.

46:44.737 --> 46:47.336
- She was in such a good mood all morning.
- Why is she in such a good mood?

46:47.436 --> 46:50.335
- They found Hector today.
- Really? Is he okay? What happened to him?

46:50.435 --> 46:52.938
Nobody knows. He's delirious.

46:53.538 --> 46:55.340
If you ask me, the guy's on meth.

46:55.440 --> 46:58.594
- What do you know about meth, Dad?
- Everything.

46:58.694 --> 47:00.012
Really? Everything?
You know everything about meth?

47:00.112 --> 47:03.148
I saw a documentary
narrated by Dwart Farquhar.

47:03.248 --> 47:07.552
- Who the shit is Dwart Farquhar?
- Farquhar. Very underrated actor.

47:07.652 --> 47:10.155
All right. I'll look into his work.
What's your favorite movie of his?

47:10.255 --> 47:13.025
- "Running out of bullets."
- I'll watch that one first.

47:13.125 --> 47:16.494
Here, I found this.

47:16.594 --> 47:18.797
That's not mine.
But I'll hold onto it for you.

47:18.897 --> 47:21.764
All right. And I know meth.

47:39.483 --> 47:41.550
How'd you get in here?

47:42.286 --> 47:44.949
- You really believe me?
- Why are you so surprised?

47:45.049 --> 47:49.191
It's the first ghost I've seen in a while.
I'm just not used to being taken seriously.

47:49.660 --> 47:52.431
Damn, it's closed. Oh, well.
Come back tomorrow?

47:53.031 --> 47:54.364
Cover me.

47:55.733 --> 47:58.568
What are you doing? What are you doing?

48:04.408 --> 48:07.276
Those are really nice windows.
Don't break those.

48:07.929 --> 48:09.213
What does that even mean?

48:21.958 --> 48:23.193
What now?

48:38.376 --> 48:39.977
Ladies first.

48:40.077 --> 48:42.381
All right. Longstreet...
Okay. Okay, there it is. Longstreet.

48:42.481 --> 48:47.152
"Elizabeth Longstreet,
died January 27, 1855.

48:47.252 --> 48:51.821
Survived by her husband, Ambrose
Longstreet, and daughter, Hannah."

48:57.945 --> 49:01.117
Look at this... Ambrose Longstreet
and his daughter, Hannah,

49:01.217 --> 49:05.921
- died on the same day, July 18, 1860."
- What do you think happened?

49:06.021 --> 49:10.308
"Last night, Longstreet Ranch,
the site of a terrible slaughter

49:10.408 --> 49:12.676
carried out by the Bogden brothers."

49:20.085 --> 49:21.378
Are you crying?

49:22.153 --> 49:24.887
I'm extra sensitive.

49:26.424 --> 49:29.291
Oh, I better not be pregnant again.

49:30.661 --> 49:32.363
Okay.

49:52.482 --> 49:55.285
Ambrose's body was found
strewn across an unmarked grave.

50:05.696 --> 50:08.266
- That's so tragic.
- No, that's it. That's it.

50:08.366 --> 50:10.502
She's the one haunting me.
The little girl, Hannah.

50:10.602 --> 50:13.772
She wants to be returned to where
her father buried her, probably.

50:13.872 --> 50:16.442
- Fuckin' "A."
- So, all we got to do is find her body,

50:16.542 --> 50:20.846
put it back in the ground. She'll be at rest,
and then we can be done with all this.

50:20.946 --> 50:22.481
- Did you say "we"?
- Shit, yeah, I said "we."

50:22.581 --> 50:26.685
You got a banana in your ear or something?
We. You and me. What, are you scared?

50:26.785 --> 50:29.854
You scared? You look a little scared,
I'm gonna be honest.

50:29.954 --> 50:32.822
Aren't you supposed to communicate
with the dead?

50:33.557 --> 50:38.327
Just ask the ghost where her body went.
I don't have all day.

50:40.197 --> 50:42.498
You raise an interesting point.

50:51.107 --> 50:53.125
- Really have to wear this?
- Keep your voice down.

50:53.225 --> 50:56.314
You're gonna wake up my dad.
And yes, we do have to wear this.

50:56.414 --> 50:59.918
If you want to make contact with the spirit
world, you have to follow specific rules,

51:00.018 --> 51:02.620
and everyone knows
they find white soothing.

51:02.720 --> 51:06.124
- I look like a klan member.
- You kind of do.

51:06.224 --> 51:08.726
Also, they're drawn to candlelight.

51:09.426 --> 51:11.429
- Can you please show a little respect?
- What?

51:11.529 --> 51:13.999
When we ask her where her spirit is,
she shouldn't feel threatened.

51:14.099 --> 51:16.701
She has to feel encouraged.
We have to encourage her.

51:16.801 --> 51:19.804
And what if she does feel threatened?

51:19.904 --> 51:22.171
How fast can you run?

51:26.177 --> 51:28.480
All right. You ready? Give me your hand.

51:29.280 --> 51:33.134
Hannah Longstreet, hi.

51:33.234 --> 51:37.289
My name is Raymond,
and this is my associate, Becca.

51:37.389 --> 51:40.892
We are inhabitants of the living world,

51:40.992 --> 51:46.930
so please tell us where your body is.

51:48.498 --> 51:50.302
That worked great.

51:50.402 --> 51:52.470
Oh, you know what?

51:52.570 --> 51:55.340
We need something that belonged to her.
The box she was buried in. I'll go get it.

51:55.440 --> 51:59.241
I'll get it. You can wait
in the creepy room alone.

52:39.516 --> 52:41.617
You fucking kidding me?

53:07.477 --> 53:10.512
Holy shit. Becca, you're not
gonna believe what I just saw.

53:11.181 --> 53:12.983
What?

53:18.557 --> 53:19.658
Dad!

53:20.158 --> 53:21.426
- Who are you?
- Dad!

53:21.526 --> 53:24.363
- Hey! Yo...
- Dad, I can explain.

53:24.463 --> 53:26.265
We thought there was
a burglar down here.

53:26.365 --> 53:30.301
Hey, you bring a girl home,
you take her up to your room.

53:30.401 --> 53:32.055
Next time you interrupt
your mother sucking my dick,

53:32.155 --> 53:34.656
- there's gonna be hell to pay.
- Did you really just say that?

53:34.756 --> 53:38.041
If I had it to do over, I wouldn't have
revealed that last piece of information.

53:39.510 --> 53:42.581
Where'd you get this?
Did you dig this up out of the yard?

53:43.381 --> 53:45.915
How'd you know it was buried
in the yard?

53:48.419 --> 53:52.056
- Dad, where's the body?
- Drop it.

53:52.156 --> 53:54.264
- Dad, tell me where the body is.
- Just drop it, Raymond. I'm warning you.

53:54.364 --> 53:56.595
- Dad, where's the body?
- I'm telling you to drop it.

53:56.695 --> 53:58.330
- Dad, I'm telling you...
- Drop it!

53:58.430 --> 54:00.829
Tell me where the body is
or I'll tell Mom.

54:12.976 --> 54:15.179
Becca, I know where the body is.

54:15.279 --> 54:17.194
I don't want to be part of this
anymore, Raymond.

54:17.294 --> 54:19.684
Becca, you're the first person
who's seen what I've seen.

54:19.784 --> 54:21.807
I've seen enough.

54:22.152 --> 54:25.621
Well, can I at least get
my mom's sheet back?

54:31.428 --> 54:33.732
- You sleep here?
- Yeah.

54:33.832 --> 54:36.451
Not everyone has parents paying
our way through business school.

54:36.551 --> 54:38.787
- Help me bury her.
- No.

54:38.887 --> 54:41.713
We bury her and it's all over.
That's how this works.

54:41.813 --> 54:45.775
Come on. How about we put the spirit
of a murdered little girl to rest?

55:17.074 --> 55:20.443
Now I got you,
you little son of a bitch.

55:22.479 --> 55:26.117
Out of the question.
It's a historical artifact.

55:26.217 --> 55:28.903
True. But it doesn't belong to you.

55:29.003 --> 55:32.290
Your father gave it to me.
That makes it a donation.

55:32.390 --> 55:35.859
And there's nothing I can do
to help persuade you?

55:39.296 --> 55:42.584
- Him. What about him?
- What about me?

55:42.684 --> 55:45.285
Give me a blow job
and you can have the skeleton.

55:49.389 --> 55:52.858
- All right.
- No! Sit.

55:54.711 --> 55:56.880
Well, I believe we're done here, then.

55:57.948 --> 56:00.685
- Were you seriously gonna give him a blow job?
- I was thinking about it.

56:00.785 --> 56:02.754
Virginia...

56:03.054 --> 56:05.489
See these young folks out, please.

56:18.501 --> 56:21.272
I can't believe your dad
gave her body to that asshole.

56:21.372 --> 56:24.342
- Guess we'll have to break in again.
- How are we gonna know where Hannah's body is?

56:24.442 --> 56:26.394
What do you kids want
with the body of a dead girl?

56:26.494 --> 56:28.063
You wouldn't believe us if we told you.

56:28.213 --> 56:30.915
Her spirit has returned
from beyond the grave, hasn't it?

56:31.015 --> 56:33.451
I've been communicating
with the spirit world my entire life.

56:33.551 --> 56:36.888
- People used to think I was crazy.
- Holy shit. I get that a lot myself.

56:36.988 --> 56:40.424
Look, lady, I don't know who you are or
what your story is, but we need your help.

56:40.524 --> 56:42.828
We can't put Hannah's spirit back
to rest if we don't have her body,

56:42.928 --> 56:47.131
- and that dildo licker won't give it to us.
- We have a storage facility downstairs.

56:47.231 --> 56:49.834
I will switch her remains
and meet you out back.

56:49.934 --> 56:53.371
Cornelius is blind as a bat.
He'll never know the difference.

56:53.471 --> 56:55.673
You have such a strong aura.

56:55.773 --> 56:59.309
Do you know, spirits are attracted
to people like you and I.

57:06.750 --> 57:09.020
Fucking weirdos.

57:17.561 --> 57:19.051
Oh, shit!

57:19.614 --> 57:21.556
What the fuck?

57:41.585 --> 57:44.122
You should probably
get that checked out.

57:45.689 --> 57:47.625
Should we say something?

57:47.725 --> 57:49.393
Yeah.

57:49.493 --> 57:52.764
Rest in peace, Hannah.
I'm sorry that you're dead. But...

57:53.464 --> 57:56.667
Hey, at least you're back together
with your family.

57:56.767 --> 57:58.533
Amen.

58:18.288 --> 58:20.436
- Hello.
- Well, I hope you two managed

58:20.536 --> 58:22.928
to relegate your activities
to the bedroom.

58:23.028 --> 58:25.263
Donald, your manners.

58:25.363 --> 58:27.164
Excuse him.

58:27.264 --> 58:30.301
- Raymond, is this your friend?
- I'm Becca.

58:30.401 --> 58:33.137
Hi. Would you like to stay
for dinner, honey?

58:33.237 --> 58:35.373
Some of Donald's players
are coming over.

58:35.960 --> 58:39.341
- Maybe another time.
- Oh, all right.

58:51.988 --> 58:54.124
- Hey, Dad?
- What are you doing here?

58:57.994 --> 59:01.299
Look, I know we don't always
see eye to eye on everything,

59:01.399 --> 59:06.404
but I just want you to know that having
a relationship with you is...

59:06.504 --> 59:08.166
it's really important to me.

59:12.209 --> 59:13.949
Raymond...

59:14.703 --> 59:16.148
you're my son.

59:23.720 --> 59:25.787
That's it?

59:26.589 --> 59:30.128
Would you mind going down to the kitchen
and helping your mom?

59:30.228 --> 59:32.962
Tonight is very important to me.

59:45.776 --> 59:48.010
Fuck my life.

59:50.780 --> 59:54.251
Every year, we have
a little get-together...

59:54.351 --> 59:56.788
for our award winners.

59:56.888 --> 59:59.123
The best of the best.

59:59.223 --> 01:00:01.192
You're my "A" squad.

01:00:01.792 --> 01:00:03.995
And I'm proud of each
and every one of you.

01:00:04.395 --> 01:00:06.661
This first award...

01:00:06.761 --> 01:00:09.803
goes to our fiercest defender
of the year.

01:00:09.903 --> 01:00:12.223
He's a young man I've watched grow

01:00:12.323 --> 01:00:16.740
from a boy to a man, and I'd like to think
I taught him everything he knows.

01:00:17.373 --> 01:00:21.045
I love him like family.
I couldn't be more proud of him.

01:00:21.745 --> 01:00:25.381
Archibald, come up here
and get this. Come on.

01:00:28.619 --> 01:00:29.887
Love you, coach.

01:00:30.187 --> 01:00:32.221
With a name like Archibald,
you kind of have to get good at sports

01:00:32.321 --> 01:00:34.584
- to avoid getting your ass kicked.
- Raymond, please.

01:00:34.684 --> 01:00:36.528
Just saying.
It's, like, the worst name ever.

01:00:36.628 --> 01:00:39.630
Now, before we get to the second award,
I want to apologize.

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:42.333
My wife forgot the grape pop.

01:00:43.111 --> 01:00:45.267
Hey, sorry.

01:00:45.835 --> 01:00:48.070
All right. Now...

01:00:48.499 --> 01:00:52.521
our second award,
that I think is the most improved...

01:00:54.211 --> 01:00:56.778
Jimmy. Come on up here.

01:00:58.516 --> 01:01:02.151
Yes. There you go, boy.

01:01:05.288 --> 01:01:09.313
Your father's just as proud of you
as he is of his players, Raymond.

01:01:13.864 --> 01:01:16.865
Sometimes he just has
a hard time showing it.

01:01:22.005 --> 01:01:23.806
Thanks.

01:02:26.836 --> 01:02:28.539
All right. Thanks for coming.

01:02:28.639 --> 01:02:32.407
All right. Playoffs begin
next week, all right?

01:02:32.909 --> 01:02:36.981
Let's be ready.
Sorry about what happened.

01:02:37.681 --> 01:02:39.970
- What the hell was that in there?
- Dad, you and Mom need to move into a hotel.

01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:42.954
- What are you talking about?
- It sounds crazy, but the house is haunted.

01:02:43.054 --> 01:02:44.589
- Are you out of your mind?
- No, I'm not!

01:02:44.689 --> 01:02:46.736
I'm sorry I embarrassed you
in front of your boyfriends, but...

01:02:46.836 --> 01:02:49.594
You've been an embarrassment to me
since the day you were born.

01:02:49.694 --> 01:02:52.730
However, I've managed to lower
my expectations to a degree

01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:56.334
that an incident like that in there
leaves me relatively unaffected.

01:02:56.434 --> 01:02:59.103
But what does bother me
is the state of your mental health,

01:02:59.203 --> 01:03:01.736
because you're acting
like a fucking nut.

01:03:02.538 --> 01:03:04.840
Now get it together!

01:03:15.552 --> 01:03:17.955
- Why won't she leave you alone?
- I don't know.

01:03:18.055 --> 01:03:20.124
Maybe she still has
unfinished business or something.

01:03:20.224 --> 01:03:23.194
We buried your body.
What are you so hung up on?

01:03:23.494 --> 01:03:25.995
My dad's gonna have me
institutionalized.

01:03:28.365 --> 01:03:32.436
Why doesn't she just come right out
and tell us what she wants?

01:03:34.018 --> 01:03:37.940
Maybe she's trying to,
and we just don't know how to hear her.

01:03:41.512 --> 01:03:44.949
Oh, Christ, Evey. You saw him tonight.

01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:47.118
Having him committed
is not the answer, Donald.

01:03:47.218 --> 01:03:49.287
- Yeah?
- He's going through a phase.

01:03:49.387 --> 01:03:52.256
- It will pass.
- What if it doesn't?

01:03:52.356 --> 01:03:56.860
We don't get to pick our children.
All we can do is love them.

01:03:58.395 --> 01:04:00.864
We should've adopted.

01:04:00.964 --> 01:04:03.401
Not some ethnic kid.
You know what I'm saying.

01:04:03.501 --> 01:04:05.503
A white kid.

01:04:06.103 --> 01:04:09.907
Donald, your breath is terrible.
Go brush, will you?

01:04:17.346 --> 01:04:21.285
- No solicitors.
- Don. Who is it?

01:04:21.385 --> 01:04:24.288
- We're here to see your son.
- Raymond?

01:04:24.388 --> 01:04:25.889
Well, whatever he's done, I apologize.

01:04:25.989 --> 01:04:27.825
- The kid's not right in the head.
- No, let her in.

01:04:27.925 --> 01:04:29.983
- Where in the hell are you going?
- He's upstairs.

01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:31.796
What's wrong with you? What are you...?

01:04:31.896 --> 01:04:35.743
It's just so good to see
Raymond making friends.

01:04:38.434 --> 01:04:41.923
Raymond, this is my granddaughter.
Zelda, say hello.

01:04:42.023 --> 01:04:45.045
Hi, Zelda. Nice to meet you.

01:04:46.843 --> 01:04:49.213
Okay. What's she doing here?

01:04:49.313 --> 01:04:50.998
Hannah's spirit has been troubling you,

01:04:51.098 --> 01:04:53.818
and speaking with someone
her own age will help relax her.

01:04:53.918 --> 01:04:56.050
It's good to see you again.

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:58.823
What's this?
Has anything happened to the body?

01:04:58.923 --> 01:05:00.889
I dropped it.

01:05:00.989 --> 01:05:03.060
She's been marked. You can't stay here.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:07.198
It's not safe for you to be in here.
You must go. You must wait outside.

01:05:07.298 --> 01:05:09.499
Good. I will wait outside.

01:05:15.204 --> 01:05:16.905
Hi.

01:05:40.563 --> 01:05:45.803
It's a phonautograph. It's the earliest
known device for recording sound.

01:05:45.903 --> 01:05:48.372
I have a tape recorder
in my backpack, if that's easier.

01:05:48.472 --> 01:05:50.775
Hannah was born in the 1800s.

01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:52.569
Our chances of communicating with her

01:05:52.669 --> 01:05:56.147
are far greater using a device
from the same period.

01:05:56.547 --> 01:05:59.483
Zelda, I'm gonna count
from three down to one.

01:05:59.583 --> 01:06:02.353
I want you to drift off
into the spirit world,

01:06:02.453 --> 01:06:05.472
but I want your mind to remain here.

01:06:05.572 --> 01:06:09.994
Three, two, one.

01:06:10.094 --> 01:06:13.481
- Can you hear me, Zelda?
- <i>Yes, grandma.</i>

01:06:13.581 --> 01:06:16.167
- How'd she do that?
- She's crossed over.

01:06:16.267 --> 01:06:20.471
Hannah, are you there? Hannah,
speak to us. Tell us what you want.

01:06:20.871 --> 01:06:22.273
<i>It's angry.</i>

01:06:22.673 --> 01:06:27.845
- Zelda, ask Hannah why she's angry.
- <i>It says it's not Hannah.</i>

01:06:28.645 --> 01:06:31.880
Zelda, did you see the spirit?
Can you describe it?

01:06:33.851 --> 01:06:35.920
Oh, my God, it's Ambrose Longstreet.

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.921
- Who?
- Hannah's father.

01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:43.944
- Ambrose, what do you want?
- <i>He won't let me go.</i>

01:06:44.044 --> 01:06:46.480
Ambrose, let her go
and tell us what you want.

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:50.101
- I want it back.
- What do you want back?

01:06:50.201 --> 01:06:52.904
- The necklace.
- What necklace? Who... who has it?

01:06:53.004 --> 01:06:54.739
- The man.
- <i>He stole it.</i>

01:06:55.534 --> 01:06:57.341
- The man.
- <i>He stole it.</i>

01:06:58.441 --> 01:07:00.809
- The man.
- <i>He stole it.</i>

01:07:01.277 --> 01:07:02.980
- The man.
- What man? Who has it?

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:06.283
- Where is the necklace, Ambrose?
- He did it.

01:07:18.429 --> 01:07:20.397
- How do you feel?
- Not so good.

01:07:20.497 --> 01:07:22.856
- Virginia, I can't do this without you.
- Raymond, you must.

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:26.737
- If not, Becca's in great danger.
- What do you mean?

01:07:26.837 --> 01:07:30.841
If a spirit interacts with someone
who's psychically unaware, it turns vengeful.

01:07:30.941 --> 01:07:33.844
You, her and your parents
will all be in great danger.

01:07:33.944 --> 01:07:36.613
It's only gonna get worse.
Where's the necklace?

01:07:36.713 --> 01:07:39.317
- I don't know what necklace he's talking about.
- Raymond, you've got to find it!

01:07:39.417 --> 01:07:41.282
Raymond.

01:07:43.987 --> 01:07:46.457
All right, that's it. That's it.
You can't stay here anymore.

01:07:46.557 --> 01:07:48.250
- Listen, Dad, you and Mom are in trouble!
- No, you listen!

01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:51.328
I've canceled your credit cards.
I've stopped payment on your apartment.

01:07:51.428 --> 01:07:52.863
- You are cut off, mister.
- Dad, this is serious.

01:07:52.963 --> 01:07:55.833
You take one step back into that house,
I'll have you committed.

01:07:55.933 --> 01:07:57.454
You understand? Committed!

01:08:33.903 --> 01:08:35.471
You look like shit.

01:08:35.572 --> 01:08:38.921
Thanks. I had a nightmare.

01:08:39.022 --> 01:08:41.745
I don't think I'll ever get over the fact
that you slept with Dave Richards.

01:08:41.845 --> 01:08:43.877
Allegedly.

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:47.149
Your neck hurt?
I've got a pill for that.

01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:50.852
I have to find that necklace before
something bad happens to my parents.

01:09:28.124 --> 01:09:31.158
Sweetheart, something to drink, please.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.198
Make it a double.

01:09:55.852 --> 01:09:57.643
So, Raymond,

01:09:57.743 --> 01:10:01.537
the doctor called and said your father
can come home this afternoon.

01:10:02.058 --> 01:10:03.694
Donald's depressed, though.

01:10:03.794 --> 01:10:07.197
It seems Archibald invited him
to the country club tonight.

01:10:07.297 --> 01:10:09.066
Country club. That figures.

01:10:09.166 --> 01:10:11.702
You know, you don't run across
a lot of poor people named Archibald.

01:10:11.802 --> 01:10:13.928
You don't, do you?

01:10:20.944 --> 01:10:22.777
Excuse me.

01:10:24.381 --> 01:10:25.812
This is fun.

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.654
I like her.

01:10:33.489 --> 01:10:36.247
Mom, please listen to me.
The house is not safe.

01:10:36.347 --> 01:10:39.429
Promise me you won't go back there,
not until I can take care of things.

01:10:39.529 --> 01:10:42.299
Raymond, for heaven's sake,
what is going on with you?

01:10:42.699 --> 01:10:43.801
I'm worried about you, honey.

01:10:43.901 --> 01:10:46.470
Just promise me you'll spend the rest
of the day at the hospital with Dad.

01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:48.603
But that's ridiculous.

01:10:50.072 --> 01:10:52.307
It will really make you feel better?

01:10:52.926 --> 01:10:56.307
- Okay, I will.
- Thank you.

01:11:02.134 --> 01:11:05.604
Mom, why do you think
Dad hates me so much?

01:11:09.125 --> 01:11:11.928
Your father doesn't hate you, Raymond.

01:11:12.028 --> 01:11:13.831
He just...

01:11:13.931 --> 01:11:16.965
He just doesn't understand some things.

01:11:17.466 --> 01:11:19.400
I'm sorry.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.575
What I want you to know is that we both
love you very, very much, honey.

01:11:25.675 --> 01:11:30.547
And we're proud of you.
And I want you to always remember that.

01:11:30.647 --> 01:11:32.650
Thanks, Mom.

01:11:38.185 --> 01:11:42.159
I just thought of something. A way that you
can get back into your dad's good graces.

01:11:42.259 --> 01:11:44.525
And come home.

01:11:46.395 --> 01:11:48.732
- Thank you.
- Keys.

01:11:48.832 --> 01:11:51.202
- Give me your keys.
- Thanks.

01:11:51.302 --> 01:11:53.637
I think... I think you
might want to stay seated

01:11:53.737 --> 01:11:55.239
- for the next...
- Oh, my goodness.

01:11:55.339 --> 01:11:58.842
...few hours. Do you have
any water or coffee? Anything?

01:11:59.142 --> 01:12:02.213
- You all right?
- I think I'm having a hot flash.

01:12:07.416 --> 01:12:08.397
Hi.

01:12:20.029 --> 01:12:21.830
Excuse me.

01:12:22.599 --> 01:12:24.635
Why, hello, Don.

01:12:24.735 --> 01:12:27.605
Got your calls. I was wondering
how long it was gonna take you

01:12:27.705 --> 01:12:30.407
before you realized Raymond
was off his antipsychotics.

01:12:30.907 --> 01:12:33.310
Listen, give me my money,

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:37.548
and I will prescribe
his "blood pressure" medication again.

01:12:37.648 --> 01:12:41.783
Okay? That's the deal. Okeydoke.

01:12:42.952 --> 01:12:45.354
Fucking cocksucker!

01:12:53.096 --> 01:12:54.830
Where's Mr. Wadsworth?

01:12:58.034 --> 01:13:00.317
Mr. Wadsworth....

01:13:00.417 --> 01:13:03.562
is in the hospital with a broken boner.

01:13:04.206 --> 01:13:07.610
I've been approved to temporarily
fill in as substitute teacher

01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:09.930
since they couldn't find
anybody else on such short notice.

01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:11.929
Bullshit.

01:13:13.515 --> 01:13:17.253
- Let's start with attendance, shall we?
- You're gay, right?

01:13:17.753 --> 01:13:19.590
Never met a gay person before.

01:13:19.690 --> 01:13:22.592
Being a football coach and all,

01:13:22.692 --> 01:13:26.400
your father must be so disappointed.

01:13:28.731 --> 01:13:31.692
Do you know me? Do you know me?

01:13:32.092 --> 01:13:35.072
I'm asking you a question.
Do you know me?

01:13:35.772 --> 01:13:37.784
I'll tell you who I am.

01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:42.015
I'm a fucking wizard...

01:13:43.013 --> 01:13:46.249
sent from the future
in a motherfucking time machine

01:13:46.349 --> 01:13:49.219
to tell you that you are an asshole.

01:13:50.519 --> 01:13:53.990
You're the type of person
that makes fun of fat, short little kids

01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:56.927
and makes them feel bad about themselves
for the rest of their lives

01:13:57.027 --> 01:14:00.077
because you think you're so special.
Well, you know what?

01:14:00.177 --> 01:14:04.968
You're not special. You're not different.
You're not even particularly interesting.

01:14:05.068 --> 01:14:09.431
You're the same bigoted, homophobic,
redneck, football-scoring,

01:14:09.531 --> 01:14:14.511
Martin Luther King-assassinating,
asshole-faced son-of-a-bitch redneck

01:14:14.611 --> 01:14:18.313
that you have spent
your entire life rebelling against.

01:14:21.016 --> 01:14:22.872
And I know...

01:14:22.972 --> 01:14:25.598
that that kills you inside.

01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:34.896
Sorry about that.

01:14:39.702 --> 01:14:42.172
- Want to get out of here?
- Yeah.

01:14:42.572 --> 01:14:45.774
Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.
Hey, fuck you, guys.

01:14:49.545 --> 01:14:51.628
All right, Becca, wait here.
Better yet, go back to the bar.

01:14:51.728 --> 01:14:53.784
- It's safer.
- Please. I can take care of myself.

01:14:53.884 --> 01:14:55.338
You've been marked.
I'm not letting you go any further.

01:14:55.438 --> 01:14:56.700
You've been marked.

01:14:57.888 --> 01:15:01.389
You saw what happened to Virginia.
You're not going in there alone.

01:15:04.394 --> 01:15:06.092
That felt good.

01:15:06.192 --> 01:15:08.158
Ambrose.

01:15:08.464 --> 01:15:13.170
Ambrose? Ambrose. Ambrose?

01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:16.230
- Ambrose.
- Check this out.

01:15:21.945 --> 01:15:23.778
You okay?

01:15:29.919 --> 01:15:32.155
Ambrose, don't kill her! I...

01:15:32.786 --> 01:15:35.724
I can fix this! Just tell me
where the necklace is.

01:15:56.912 --> 01:15:59.249
I'm not riding in this thing again
until you get new tags.

01:15:59.349 --> 01:16:01.184
Do you have any idea how many drugs
I have on me right now?

01:16:01.284 --> 01:16:03.983
Just keep watch while I sneak inside.

01:16:12.661 --> 01:16:15.464
Well, my night just got
a whole lot more interesting.

01:16:23.939 --> 01:16:27.100
Dad? Are you all right?

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.310
Did you say something?

01:16:31.681 --> 01:16:34.855
Eve sent you a gorgeous bouquet.

01:16:35.818 --> 01:16:38.395
I'm gonna get you some water.

01:16:45.761 --> 01:16:47.665
Where's the necklace?

01:16:49.065 --> 01:16:51.132
Noelle.

01:17:05.013 --> 01:17:07.759
- Get on the couch! Who are you?
- Okay, okay. I can explain. I can expl...

01:17:07.859 --> 01:17:10.454
- Who are you?
- I'm a friend of your father's, Raymond.

01:17:10.554 --> 01:17:13.590
He was working at my parents' house
the night that he disappeared.

01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:17.327
Oh, you're... you're Eve's son.

01:17:17.427 --> 01:17:19.530
- Raymond.
- Raymond.

01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:21.181
Jesus.

01:17:21.281 --> 01:17:23.783
Does that necklace belong to you?

01:17:24.456 --> 01:17:27.237
No. I... Well, I found it
in my father's jacket.

01:17:27.337 --> 01:17:31.141
I'm sorry, it's stolen property,
and I'm gonna have to ask for it back.

01:17:31.241 --> 01:17:33.076
Stolen?

01:17:34.544 --> 01:17:36.105
Sorry.

01:17:36.205 --> 01:17:39.349
Just take it. It's not really my thing,
anyway. It's vintage, so...

01:17:39.449 --> 01:17:40.584
So you're Hector's daughter.

01:17:40.684 --> 01:17:44.721
It's so weird our families have known
each other for so long, yet we've never met.

01:17:44.821 --> 01:17:48.525
I was grounded for most
of my childhood, so there was that.

01:17:48.625 --> 01:17:51.181
And then I run an Internet business.
It keeps me busy.

01:17:51.281 --> 01:17:53.664
- Busty latina Bootys, right?
- You know my site?

01:17:53.864 --> 01:17:55.332
Bootylover44.

01:17:56.909 --> 01:17:59.542
- You're a kinky one.
- You're... you're Noelle!

01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:01.166
- You're a dirty one.
- I am a dirty one.

01:18:01.266 --> 01:18:04.941
- You are a dirty one. It is.
- Small world. Holy shit. Small world.

01:18:05.041 --> 01:18:07.123
I can't tell you what a pleasure
it's been masturbating to you.

01:18:07.423 --> 01:18:10.981
Thank you. No, it's been
a real pleasure taking your money.

01:18:11.481 --> 01:18:12.733
So, you want to watch TV or something?

01:18:12.833 --> 01:18:15.334
- No. You should probably...
- I'll leave.

01:18:19.154 --> 01:18:21.458
- Where's my car?
- They towed it.

01:18:21.558 --> 01:18:24.728
- You didn't stop them?
- Fucking pigs.

01:18:24.828 --> 01:18:27.240
Come on, my car's at the bar.

01:18:28.932 --> 01:18:30.467
Shouldn't we call a cab?

01:18:30.867 --> 01:18:34.337
Well, yeah, dude, because they're
a bunch of liberal cocksuckers.

01:18:34.837 --> 01:18:36.706
You listening to a word we're saying?

01:18:36.806 --> 01:18:40.077
They'll socialize that jacket
if you let 'em.

01:18:40.177 --> 01:18:42.645
- Fuck.
- My keys are in the back.

01:18:44.295 --> 01:18:47.751
What you got there, bud? Give it to me!

01:18:48.651 --> 01:18:51.051
- Give it back, Pope! Seriously, man!
- What the fuck are you gonna do about it?

01:18:51.151 --> 01:18:52.631
You know what?

01:18:52.731 --> 01:18:54.687
I'm gonna punch you in the face
and probably get my ass kicked.

01:18:54.787 --> 01:18:56.590
Prove it.

01:18:57.961 --> 01:18:59.860
Suck on that.

01:19:01.163 --> 01:19:05.803
Fellas, make sure to tell
my parole officer this was self-defense.

01:19:06.703 --> 01:19:08.405
Lay a hand on him
and there's gonna be trouble.

01:19:08.505 --> 01:19:11.174
- Stay back, Becca. Stay back.
- Stay the fuck out of this, Becca.

01:19:11.274 --> 01:19:13.710
I've never hit a girl,
and I'm not about to start.

01:19:13.810 --> 01:19:16.613
- I'm pretty sure I'll like it.
- I'm not scared of you, Pope.

01:19:17.413 --> 01:19:21.683
Fine, girly. Just remember
that you begged for it.

01:19:24.364 --> 01:19:27.083
- Fuck!
- Jesus Christ!

01:19:30.993 --> 01:19:32.815
Keys!

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:52.916
What the hell are you doing here?

01:19:53.016 --> 01:19:55.635
Mom, what happened to your neck?
Are you okay?

01:19:55.735 --> 01:19:59.456
The banister broke. Which is odd,
we just had it replaced.

01:19:59.556 --> 01:20:02.559
- Mom, get out of the house right now.
- She's not going anywhere, all right?

01:20:02.659 --> 01:20:05.062
Did I not warn you about
stepping foot in this house again?

01:20:05.162 --> 01:20:07.848
- Don...
- And you stop running after my boy.

01:20:07.948 --> 01:20:10.633
- You're trouble.
- Suck my dick.

01:20:10.733 --> 01:20:12.735
What are you gonna do
with those shovels?

01:20:13.511 --> 01:20:17.594
Wait! Wait! Wait. Wait.

01:20:19.708 --> 01:20:23.330
Stop. Stop!
Stop with the goddamn shovels.

01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:25.282
Stop tearing up my goddamn yard!

01:20:25.382 --> 01:20:29.419
Hey, Dad, thanks for telling me I've been
on antipsychotics for the past 15 years.

01:20:29.519 --> 01:20:31.387
- What?
- The blood-pressure medication

01:20:31.487 --> 01:20:33.957
I've been on for like half my life,
it's all a freaking lie.

01:20:34.057 --> 01:20:36.943
Dad's been getting Dr. Carpenter
to prescribe me antipsychotics.

01:20:37.043 --> 01:20:39.966
And for good reason.
Ever since you started taking these,

01:20:40.066 --> 01:20:42.949
you stopped seeing those goddamn ghosts.

01:20:43.049 --> 01:20:46.215
Remember how he scared you
all the time, acting crazy like this?

01:20:46.315 --> 01:20:48.855
Like he is right now? Stop it!

01:20:48.955 --> 01:20:51.834
You're in big trouble, Raymond.
Big trouble. Eve, make the call.

01:20:51.934 --> 01:20:54.828
No. I won't, Donald.

01:20:54.928 --> 01:20:59.215
All right. If you want to do something
right, you do it your goddamn self.

01:20:59.315 --> 01:21:02.717
- What's he doing?
- He's having you committed.

01:21:03.852 --> 01:21:05.620
Good.

01:21:19.869 --> 01:21:21.171
They're coming, Raymond.

01:21:21.271 --> 01:21:24.307
The wagon from the nuthouse
is coming to take you away.

01:21:24.407 --> 01:21:26.740
Is that a dead body?

01:21:29.011 --> 01:21:30.745
Sleep well, Hannah.

01:21:33.683 --> 01:21:35.285
It's all right. He's got to go.

01:21:35.385 --> 01:21:38.252
- Donald...
- Stop. Stop. Stop it.

01:23:42.844 --> 01:23:44.735
What...

01:23:50.853 --> 01:23:52.388
Allow me to explain.

01:23:52.488 --> 01:23:55.792
We just reunited a family
in the afterlife

01:23:55.892 --> 01:23:59.028
and spared you from the wrath
of a vengeful spirit.

01:23:59.128 --> 01:24:02.693
So, on behalf of Becca and I,
I would just like to say...

01:24:02.793 --> 01:24:06.369
fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you,

01:24:06.469 --> 01:24:09.804
and especially, fuck you.

01:24:11.807 --> 01:24:14.475
- Not you, Mom. I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:24:20.583 --> 01:24:22.681
"F" you!

01:24:59.988 --> 01:25:03.178
Congratulations on your first day.
Nervous?

01:25:03.278 --> 01:25:05.595
Yeah, I'm nervous. I mean,
you gave up bartending to work for me.

01:25:05.695 --> 01:25:09.098
- What if this doesn't pan out?
- I believe in you.

01:25:09.198 --> 01:25:11.654
Ready to greet your customers?

01:25:11.754 --> 01:25:13.518
Yeah.

01:25:23.245 --> 01:25:26.950
Well, it's morning.
Most hauntings happen at night.

01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:28.801
I don't need you to cheer me up.

01:26:00.982 --> 01:26:03.817
Everyone, shut the fuck up!

01:26:04.986 --> 01:26:08.757
Please sign in, and we'll get to you
one at a time as fast as we can.

01:26:15.731 --> 01:26:17.365
Thanks.

<i>One Saturday I took a walk to Zipperhead</i>

01:26:33.881 --> 01:26:36.797
<i>I met a girl there
and she almost knocked me dead</i>

01:26:36.897 --> 01:26:40.746
<i>Punk rock girl, please look at me
What do you see?</i>

01:26:40.846 --> 01:26:46.261
<i>Let's travel 'round the world
Just you and me, punk rock girl</i>

01:26:46.361 --> 01:26:50.364
<i>I tapped her on the shoulder
and said do you have a bell?</i>

01:26:50.464 --> 01:26:53.465
<i>She looked at me and smiled
and said she did not know</i>

01:26:53.565 --> 01:26:57.453
<i>Punk rock girl, give me a chance
Let's go slamdance</i>

01:26:57.553 --> 01:27:03.054
<i>We'll dress like Minnie Pearl
Just you and me, punk rock girl</i>

01:27:03.748 --> 01:27:07.549
<i>We went to the Philly Pizza Company
and ordered some hot tea</i>

01:27:07.649 --> 01:27:11.104
<i>The waitress said "Well, no,
we only have it iced"</i>

01:27:11.204 --> 01:27:14.889
<i>So we jumped up on the table
and shouted "Anarchy"</i>

01:27:14.989 --> 01:27:18.657
<i>And someone played a Beach Boys song
on the jukebox</i>

01:27:18.757 --> 01:27:22.702
<i>It was "California Dreamin'"
So we started screamin'</i>

01:27:22.802 --> 01:27:26.388
<i>"On such a winter's day"</i>

01:27:27.857 --> 01:27:31.096
<i>She took me to her parents
for a Sunday meal</i>

01:27:31.196 --> 01:27:34.572
<i>Her father took one look at me
and he began to squeal</i>

01:27:34.672 --> 01:27:38.509
<i>Punk rock girl, it makes no sense
Your dad is the Vice President</i>

01:27:38.609 --> 01:27:44.447
<i>Rich as the Duke of Earl
Yeah, you're for me, punk rock girl</i>

01:28:01.221 --> 01:28:05.013
<i>We went to a shopping mall
and laughed at all the shoppers</i>

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:08.934
<i>And security guards trailed us
to a record shop</i>

01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:12.463
<i>We asked for Mojo Nixon
They said "He don't work here"</i>

01:28:12.563 --> 01:28:18.154
<i>We said "If you don't got Mojo Nixon
Then your store could use some fixin'"</i>

01:28:19.654 --> 01:28:22.775
<i>We got into a car,
away we started rollin'</i>

01:28:22.875 --> 01:28:26.281
<i>I said "How much you pay for this?"
She said "Nothing man, it's stolen"</i>

01:28:26.381 --> 01:28:30.202
<i>Punk rock girl, you look so wild
Let's have a child</i>

01:28:30.302 --> 01:28:33.617
<i>We'll name her Minnie Pearl
Just you and me</i>

01:28:33.717 --> 01:28:37.285
<i>Eat fudge banana swirl, just you and me</i>

01:28:37.385 --> 01:28:42.445
<i>We'll travel 'round the world
Just you and me</i>

01:28:42.545 --> 01:28:45.065
<i>Punk rock girl</i>
