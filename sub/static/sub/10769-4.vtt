WEBVTT

00:09.576 --> 00:11.066
What the heck is that?

00:11.244 --> 00:12.575
It's a fiber shake.

00:12.746 --> 00:15.408
I've got an interview
with an old Princeton chum of Dad's.

00:15.582 --> 00:19.575
I need to be strong. I need to be alert.
And I need to be regular.

00:21.621 --> 00:24.146
Ain't nothing in the world
gonna make you regular, man.

00:26.059 --> 00:28.323
- Good morning.
- Geoffrey, are my sandwiches ready yet?

00:29.696 --> 00:31.960
Philip, for God's sake,
we're going to SeaWorld.

00:32.131 --> 00:33.963
There's gonna be food stands
everywhere.

00:34.134 --> 00:38.434
That may be true, Aunt Viv, but there ain't
gonna be no food stand in the Volvo.

00:38.605 --> 00:40.800
You better let that man eat
and give him food...

00:40.974 --> 00:43.966
...or he'll mess around
and chew one of your arms off in the car.

00:45.578 --> 00:48.945
Carlton, I had a talk with Frank Bradley
this morning from Princeton.

00:49.115 --> 00:51.777
- You ready for your big interview tomorrow?
- Am I ever.

00:51.951 --> 00:55.717
I've been enhancing my résumé all week.
I applied for a job at Dole headquarters.

00:55.889 --> 00:59.188
And yesterday, I went down
to the rec center to become a Big Brother.

00:59.626 --> 01:00.820
Now, why you go and do that?

01:00.994 --> 01:03.258
You certainly ain't big,
and as far as being a brother...

01:07.067 --> 01:09.194
Well, I've already planned
what I'm gonna wear.

01:09.369 --> 01:11.303
I've got my argyles,
my wide-wale cords...

01:11.471 --> 01:13.996
...and my lucky sweater. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:14.174 --> 01:17.735
Master Carlton, about your sweater,
we've had a dryer mishap.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.849
Don't worry, Carlton, it'll shrink.

01:30.323 --> 01:34.885
It's just a small setback.
I still have the canary-yellow one.

01:35.061 --> 01:37.552
I forgive you, Geoffrey.

01:40.700 --> 01:43.225
Banks residence. Oh, yes, certainly.

01:43.403 --> 01:45.894
- For you, Master Carlton.
- Oh, thank you.

01:46.072 --> 01:47.699
Hello?

01:47.874 --> 01:48.966
Yes.

01:49.142 --> 01:51.201
It's the rec center.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.269
Uh-huh.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.937
All right.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.777
What?

01:58.218 --> 02:00.345
I can't be a Big Brother?

02:00.520 --> 02:02.283
They didn't like me?

02:02.455 --> 02:06.016
Well, you tell those little brats
I don't like them either.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.074

03:21.968 --> 03:25.426
Will, this sweater will work
for my interview tomorrow, right?

03:25.605 --> 03:29.200
Uh, that depends,
are you going as Archie or Jughead?

03:32.812 --> 03:34.541
Hello?

03:35.281 --> 03:38.910
Dole headquarters?
No, man, we don't want no pineapples.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.950
Give me that.

03:41.287 --> 03:43.414
Carlton Banks here.

03:44.157 --> 03:45.556
Huh?

03:45.725 --> 03:48.125
What do you mean I didn't get the job?

03:48.294 --> 03:53.357
Budget problems?
But I was volunteering. Hello?

03:54.100 --> 03:56.500
Hey, Carlton. Carlton.
Hey, it's cool. Relax, man.

03:56.669 --> 03:59.399
Everything's gonna be all right.
Hey, look here.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.767
<i>National Geographic, huh?</i>

04:01.941 --> 04:06.878
Special issue. The ladies of the Sudan,
you know what I'm saying, huh?

04:07.046 --> 04:09.241
How much more bad luck can I have?

04:09.415 --> 04:11.007
I mean, face it, Will...

04:11.184 --> 04:14.881
...Princeton will never accept me.
I've got nothing to offer.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.815
Hey, hey, Carlton. Now, hold on.
You stop that. Now, come on.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.392
You got plenty to offer.
What are you talking about?

04:21.560 --> 04:24.052
You got... You got the...

04:25.131 --> 04:29.534
See what I'm saying?
From before, you still got... You still got...

04:31.704 --> 04:33.763
- Give me a hand here.
- Ugh.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.205
Carlton, Carlton. All right.
Hey, look, I just saw it in here.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.538
You got your grade card.

04:39.712 --> 04:41.179
Yeah.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.144
- Princeton is about academics.
- Yes.

04:43.316 --> 04:46.149
- And I am second to none.
- Ha! You got that right.

04:47.086 --> 04:49.577
Mama, no!

04:57.463 --> 05:01.194
Hey, what's up, G?
Another Village People reunion?

05:02.702 --> 05:07.366
As it is my weekend off, I've decided
to head for the Circle M Dude Ranch.

05:07.540 --> 05:12.409
There's nothing like the feel of an animal
beneath you to recharge your battery.

05:14.113 --> 05:17.139
I know what you're talking about there,
G.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.842
No, I'm afraid you don't, Master William.

05:20.253 --> 05:24.121
But I do find it rather endearing
when you think you do.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.587
Have a nice weekend.

05:27.794 --> 05:30.854
Have fun at the "dude ranch."

05:32.598 --> 05:34.259
Oh! Hey, Ashley? What's up?

05:34.434 --> 05:37.528
That's right, 8:00.
Sure, bring whoever you want.

05:37.704 --> 05:41.265
Music? Are you kidding? Of course.
There's gonna be wall-to-wall music.

05:41.441 --> 05:44.774
Whoa, hey, hey, hey. What do you think
you're doing, young lady?

05:45.311 --> 05:47.836
My parents are away,
I have the house to myself.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.175
I'm having a party, duh.

05:51.484 --> 05:55.318
- You...
- The whole world's having a party.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.629
Hey. What's up, C?

06:04.797 --> 06:07.630
Oh, dear mother of God.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.234
This can't continue.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.496
What's wrong, man?

06:12.772 --> 06:14.296
Would you look?

06:14.474 --> 06:17.102
Red, yellow, brown, green.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.710
That's the way I understood it to be.

06:19.879 --> 06:23.007
But now, blue.

06:25.852 --> 06:28.821
Has the world gone mad?

06:30.623 --> 06:33.114
They're just M&M's, C.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.299
<i>The blues</i>

06:52.979 --> 06:55.004
Okay, that's enough of that.
Come on, man.

06:55.181 --> 06:58.344
Now let's see that big
Carlton Banks smile, man. Come on.

06:58.518 --> 07:00.247
Will, I wanna be alone.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.251
I told Uncle Phil
I was gonna look out for you.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.482
Come on, gotta get it together. You got that
big Princeton interview tomorrow.

07:06.959 --> 07:10.622
- Oh, whoever it is, tell them to go away.
- Ah, ha, ha.

07:10.797 --> 07:13.357
Not so fast, man.
I got a little surprise for you.

07:13.533 --> 07:16.434
Now, nothing makes a brother
who's feeling down feel better...

07:16.602 --> 07:19.127
...than seeing somebody
who's in worse shape.

07:19.305 --> 07:20.829
Huh?

07:21.407 --> 07:23.967
I called up Stinky McGuire.

07:24.343 --> 07:28.109
Yeah? Stinky's here?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.579
I haven't seen him since high school.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.945
Seeing him would cheer me up.

07:33.119 --> 07:37.112
I mean, he was always such a loser.
He was even shorter than me.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.485
Well, bring him in.

07:41.928 --> 07:44.260
Hey, Carlton.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.730
Party, dude.

07:55.174 --> 07:58.302
Come on, man. Come on.
Oh, we gonna have some fun, man.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.811
We gonna get some strippers or something.
We gonna have a ball. Come on.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.415
Will, I'm not in the mood for this.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.355
Oh.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.785
You not in the mood for this, huh?

08:14.961 --> 08:17.122
Well, look here, too short...

08:18.030 --> 08:22.296
...if you wanna sit around and wallow
in the stench of your own self-pity...

08:22.468 --> 08:24.095
...then you go right ahead.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.828
Will, you don't understand.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.200
Oh, no, I understand, you big baby.

08:30.943 --> 08:34.777
"My sweater shrunk. My grades are low.

08:34.947 --> 08:38.678
My head is too small for my body."

08:39.184 --> 08:41.119
It is?

08:41.287 --> 08:43.255
Oh, shut up, Carlton.

08:43.422 --> 08:46.585
Now, I'm gonna tell you something.
I am not gonna sit around here...

08:46.759 --> 08:50.752
...with your stank-robe-wearing,
slipper-shuffling...

08:50.930 --> 08:54.627
...résumé-polishing,
little-kids-don't-like-me blues.

08:55.334 --> 08:59.794
Now, I'm about to go out and I'm gonna
get me a 16-piece nugget dinner.

08:59.972 --> 09:03.499
And when I get back,
I wanna see a new attitude, mister.

09:04.777 --> 09:07.507
And for God's sakes, clean yourself up.

09:12.318 --> 09:15.515
- Whoa, hey. Yo, Ash, the cops are outside.
- What?

09:15.688 --> 09:18.919
- No, no, I was just kidding. I'm playing.
- Will, what are you doing?

09:19.091 --> 09:21.889
I gotta get barbecue sauce.
Dude tried to play me down there.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.394
You know, they give you the same amount
whether you get six or 16.

09:26.799 --> 09:29.393
- Who is this?
- Oh, this is my cousin, Will.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.060
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, hey. Roar, watch it, girl.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.364
Ah-ah.

09:33.539 --> 09:35.700
You can look, but don't touch, baby.

09:35.875 --> 09:39.675
- Get your sauce and nuggets and get out.
- All right, all right.

09:39.845 --> 09:42.075
Hey, hey, hey, look.

09:42.448 --> 09:45.975
Make sure you stay friends with that one
in the pink, you know what I mean?

09:46.152 --> 09:50.555
Couple more years of seasoning, you know,
put a little barbecue sauce on her...

09:50.723 --> 09:54.523
...let her marinate, you know what I mean?
- Oh, get out. Get out right now, Will.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.389
Ashley.

10:02.401 --> 10:03.959
Hello?

10:04.136 --> 10:06.661
Hey. Uh... Uh, yes, sir.
Hold on one second.

10:06.839 --> 10:08.932
Carlton.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.669
Carlton!

10:13.346 --> 10:17.009
I'm sorry, can I take a message?
I'll have him call you right back.

10:17.416 --> 10:21.546
Oh. Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely. All right.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.017
Carlton, dude from Princeton called.

10:24.190 --> 10:27.489
He had an emergency.
He has to do the interview tonight.

10:29.161 --> 10:31.186
Carlton!

10:31.364 --> 10:33.332
Where the hell are you at?

10:35.601 --> 10:37.228
<i>Dear Will, you were right.</i>

10:37.403 --> 10:40.531
<i>I shouldn't be burdening the family
with my low-down, whiny-mouth...</i>

10:40.706 --> 10:45.006
<i>... sniveling, M&M-eating,
feel-sorry-for-myself blues.</i>

10:45.711 --> 10:47.542
<i>P.S.</i>

10:48.381 --> 10:51.839
<i>My head is too small for my body.</i>

11:04.230 --> 11:07.825
<i>Nobody loves me but my mother</i>

11:10.036 --> 11:12.732
<i>And she could be jivin' too</i>

11:16.142 --> 11:19.305
<i>Now you know why
I act funny with you, baby</i>

11:19.478 --> 11:24.040
<i>When you do the things you do</i>

11:29.689 --> 11:31.714
I'm home.

11:41.167 --> 11:44.728
Ashley, Kyle has been here for half an hour.
Are you gonna meet him or not?

11:44.904 --> 11:47.099
Yeah. No.

11:47.273 --> 11:48.865
Wait.

11:49.041 --> 11:53.273
- I thought this was the point of this party.
- Yeah, it is. Just give me a second.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.347
Okay. Like, one one-thousand.

11:56.515 --> 11:59.006
- Kyle, come here.
- What are you doing?

11:59.919 --> 12:01.386
What's up, Kee?

12:01.554 --> 12:03.579
Ashley, this is Kyle.

12:03.756 --> 12:07.590
Kyle, this is Ashley.
She's been dying to meet you.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.161
I've heard a lot about you, Ashley.

12:12.331 --> 12:14.265
Great party. This is nice.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.230
- Really? You think so?
- Mm-hm.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.666
Well, I have parties all the time.

12:18.838 --> 12:20.965
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.539
And your parents don't mind?

12:22.708 --> 12:25.973
Mind? Ha!
They practically write out the guest list.

12:26.145 --> 12:29.410
Wow, I wish my parents were that cool.

12:30.216 --> 12:32.047
Ash.

12:36.355 --> 12:37.652
Ash.

12:39.391 --> 12:41.951
I think that guy is calling you.

12:42.128 --> 12:45.120
- Don't worry, he's part of the cleaning crew.
- Oh.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.622
Ash.

12:52.338 --> 12:56.365
It's so hard to find good help. Excuse me.

12:57.676 --> 13:00.167
- What do you want?
- Ashley, Carlton ran away.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.177
- Great.
- Wait, hey, hey, hey.

13:02.348 --> 13:03.713
Come on, I'm being serious.

13:03.883 --> 13:07.546
Now, I've been calling around. I don't know
where he is. We gotta go find him.

13:07.720 --> 13:12.248
No, Will, I'm having a party.
I'm carefree, understand? Free of cares?

13:13.425 --> 13:15.689
How's my hair? How are my lips?
Do I look okay?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.320
You look beautiful, Ashley.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.892
Thanks. Now get out.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.562
"How's my hair? How's my face?

13:25.738 --> 13:27.330
How's my stuff and my other stuff?"

13:30.342 --> 13:32.071
Hello.

13:32.678 --> 13:37.240
Ugh, yeah, yeah, thanks a lot.
Yeah, I'll be right down to pick him up.

13:44.723 --> 13:47.419
Hey, somebody called me
about picking up my cousin Carlton?

13:47.593 --> 13:51.154
Yeah, we get a runaway yuppie
down here every week.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.891
He's over there at the bar
throwing back ginger ales.

13:56.035 --> 13:59.129
Eddie, it ain't gonna fill itself up.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.034
Carlton.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.539
What are you doing?

14:03.709 --> 14:07.509
- Will, how'd you find me?
- Never mind. We're going home. Come on...

14:08.447 --> 14:13.316
Hey, Carlton. All right, look, the alumni guy
from Princeton called. He's coming tonight.

14:13.485 --> 14:15.282
I can't do it, Will.

14:15.454 --> 14:18.548
I just can't handle
another disappointment.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.551
This is where I belong.

14:20.726 --> 14:23.354
- Ain't that right, Tiny?
- Shut up.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.129
Yeah, we're brothers of a tortured soul.

14:27.299 --> 14:29.290
We support each other.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.160
Take Sach over there.

14:34.406 --> 14:35.839
Better yet, take Pappy.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.670
He's been telling me
about riding the rails.

14:40.846 --> 14:42.643
You hear that, Will? Riding the rails.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.283
I mean, I don't have a clue
what he's talking about...

14:45.451 --> 14:47.885
...but darn
if he doesn't make it sound exciting.

14:48.954 --> 14:52.390
Okay,
I want you to get into the car, okay?

14:52.558 --> 14:54.389
Will, you couldn't possibly understand.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.892
I mean, how could you?
You've got everything.

14:57.062 --> 15:00.498
You have the job, you have the girls,
and damn it, you've got the height.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.598
You don't know the blues.
How could you?

15:07.740 --> 15:08.764
Oh, heh.

15:08.941 --> 15:11.102
- Oh, I don't know the blues, huh?
- That's right.

15:11.277 --> 15:15.338
Yeah, like everything's been perfect for me.
You know, like growing up in the projects.

15:15.514 --> 15:17.948
<i>Growing up in the projects</i>

15:20.252 --> 15:21.617
Never having any money.

15:21.787 --> 15:24.813
<i>Ain't never had a dime</i>

15:25.524 --> 15:28.084
Never knowing whether
my father was gonna come home.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.627
<i>He left and he ain't come back yet</i>

15:35.167 --> 15:38.762
Excuse me, Pappy,
why don't you take a nappy?

15:45.010 --> 15:48.844
Listen, I am not about to stand here
and argue with you about who has it worse.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.812
The fact of the matter is
neither one of us has it that bad.

15:51.984 --> 15:54.612
But this is your last chance
to get into Princeton.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.085
If you wanna blow that,
you go right ahead.

16:10.202 --> 16:12.670
What were you doing?
No one's allowed in the bedrooms.

16:12.838 --> 16:13.930
Hey, relax, Ash.

16:14.106 --> 16:16.404
- We're just taking a little tour.
- Ha-ha-ha!

16:18.477 --> 16:22.038
- Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
- I gotta get up tomorrow and go to practice.

16:22.214 --> 16:25.547
- But the party was great. Thanks, I had fun.
- You had a good time? Good.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.185
- I had a real good time.
- Cool.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.344
Okay. Excuse me.

16:29.521 --> 16:31.113
Ugh.

16:32.091 --> 16:34.525
- Maybe I'll see you again?
- Yeah, we should hook up.

16:34.693 --> 16:37.184
Oh, wait a minute, um,
I don't have your number.

16:37.363 --> 16:39.024
Yeah.

16:43.569 --> 16:46.561
We're gonna have to get you
some school supplies. Bye, Ashley.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.798
- Bye.
- All right.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.607
Oh, no, no, no. Not in this house.

16:53.779 --> 16:55.371
Get out.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.980
- And what do you think you're doing?
- I'm just having a smoke.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.279
Not here you're not, idiot.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.219
Could somebody turn down the music?

17:08.961 --> 17:12.589
Carlton, I really appreciate your willingness
to change your schedule.

17:15.567 --> 17:19.263
Well, changing is one of my strong suits,
Mr. Bradley.

17:25.644 --> 17:28.909
As you know, your father and I
were classmates at Princeton.

17:29.081 --> 17:31.641
He was quite the big man on campus.

17:31.817 --> 17:33.546
He's even bigger now. Ha-ha-ha.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.552
- Yeah, well, aren't we all?
- Oh! Ha-ha-ha.

17:38.023 --> 17:40.355
I was very impressed
with your application.

17:40.526 --> 17:44.326
Particularly cogent was your essay
on the fall of Eastern Europe.

17:44.496 --> 17:46.726
Mm. If you like Eastern Europe
in the fall...

17:46.899 --> 17:49.231
...you should see it in the spring,
it's beautiful.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.392
Oh, you. Ha-ha-ha.

17:53.038 --> 17:58.066
Oh, you've got a good sense of humor.
Obviously, you got that from your dad.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.676
Oh, you know my Dad?

17:59.845 --> 18:02.780
Well, yes,
didn't I just mention that a moment ago?

18:02.948 --> 18:07.612
Ah! Oh, yeah. Of course. Of course.
Big man on campus.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.310
Right. Right. Ah.

18:09.488 --> 18:13.219
I see here that
you've worked for a lot of charities.

18:13.392 --> 18:15.792
Which one meant the most to you?

18:15.961 --> 18:17.155
Um...

18:17.329 --> 18:18.728
The second one.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.558
But this has all been about me, Mr. Bradley.
Me, me, me.

18:22.734 --> 18:25.567
Frank, is there a Mrs. Bradley?
A couple of baby Bradleys?

18:25.737 --> 18:28.001
<i>Hey, have you seen Braveheart?</i>

18:29.007 --> 18:32.033
Look, friend,
we can talk about candy all day...

18:32.211 --> 18:35.738
...but you ain't gonna convince me
that blue was a bad way to go.

18:37.182 --> 18:38.274
By the way...

18:38.817 --> 18:41.615
...I hear that whistle blowing.
I got a train to catch.

18:41.787 --> 18:45.553
- Well, let's go.
- Hey, hold on there, Sparky.

18:45.724 --> 18:50.093
Before you catch any train, how about you
telling me what you're running away from?

18:50.963 --> 18:52.555
Okay.

18:52.731 --> 18:54.892
But this won't be pretty.

18:55.400 --> 18:59.598
I must say, I was riveted
by your thesis on regressive taxation.

18:59.771 --> 19:04.231
How did you arrive
at such a scintillating hypothesis?

19:08.547 --> 19:12.540
But I guess the signs were always there.

19:12.718 --> 19:15.846
Oh, sure these chiseled good looks
and striking personality...

19:16.021 --> 19:18.512
...opened the doors of opportunity
quickly...

19:18.690 --> 19:20.954
...but lately,
they've been closing even quicker.

19:21.360 --> 19:26.297
Oh, heck, who am I kidding?
Look at me, I'm not Princeton material.

19:26.698 --> 19:28.962
Like the song says, Pappy...

19:29.134 --> 19:31.466
..."you gotta know when to fold them."

19:31.937 --> 19:33.928
It's my time to fold.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.336
Sounds like, to me, you're giving up.

19:37.242 --> 19:39.403
You're a smart man, Pappy.

19:40.412 --> 19:44.178
Listen, Carlton,
it's one thing to throw in the hand...

19:44.349 --> 19:48.718
...but it's another thing
to get up from the table and quit the game.

19:53.292 --> 19:57.991
You honestly believe that Superman
could beat the Flash in a foot race?

20:02.000 --> 20:05.731
Oh, Mr. Bradley, I'm glad you're still here.
Carlton Banks.

20:05.904 --> 20:06.928
What?

20:07.105 --> 20:09.903
That's poppycock. I'm Carlton Banks.

20:10.075 --> 20:12.509
No, Will, your charade is not necessary.

20:12.678 --> 20:16.705
Now, if you'll excuse us,
Mr. Bradley and I need to talk.

20:21.653 --> 20:26.249
A lot of these legacies I interview,
they've got the grades, the résumé...

20:26.425 --> 20:29.053
...but they're sheltered, you know?

20:29.428 --> 20:31.692
Like that milquetoast cousin of yours.

20:32.598 --> 20:35.692
But you really impressed me tonight.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.995
I'd be happy to sign
a letter of recommendation for you.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.934
Thank you.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.604
Bye-bye.

20:46.278 --> 20:47.973
Thanks for covering for me tonight.

20:48.146 --> 20:51.206
Oh, no, no problem, man.
I'm just glad you came back when you did.

20:51.383 --> 20:55.149
I'm starting to get a little too comfortable
in this stuff, know what I'm saying?

21:00.592 --> 21:02.287
Um...

21:02.461 --> 21:04.156
Carlton, hold up.

21:12.471 --> 21:15.668
Mom and Dad leave for the night
and you take advantage like this?

21:15.841 --> 21:17.172
And what about you, mister?

21:17.342 --> 21:20.675
What kind of role model are you?
If it weren't for me, the two of you...

21:20.846 --> 21:25.579
...would have this family on the way to hell
in a handbasket. And another thing, what...?

21:25.751 --> 21:28.879
- He's back.
- He's back.

21:29.721 --> 21:32.884
What do you mean, I'm back?
Of course, I'm back.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.430
I'm home.
