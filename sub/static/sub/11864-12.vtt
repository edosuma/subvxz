01:09.527 --> 01:12.279
Some allegedly clever writer once wrote

01:12.405 --> 01:14.861
that death was the big sleep.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.984
Big sleep, my ass.

01:21.247 --> 01:24.498
Seriously, what a crock that guy was peddling.

01:26.378 --> 01:31.123
I was finding what had happened to me
harder and harder to handle at night.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.333
Night-time had become the enemy.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.426
Maybe taking souls for a living,

01:39.557 --> 01:41.846
taking souls from the living,

01:41.976 --> 01:45.511
was finally taking its toll on me.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.099
Fuck it!

01:51.820 --> 01:56.980
I guess watching someone die
had its way of staying with you.

01:58.201 --> 02:03.824
Death was a fragrance that lingered
long after that person has left the room.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.033
Here we see a zebra,

02:06.167 --> 02:10.211
grazing in a meadow
and other flora in the region.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.248
I would try to distract myself.

02:14.384 --> 02:18.761
I would try to think about something
other than death. Anything.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.973
The lion lives off the zebra...

02:23.810 --> 02:27.642
.. as part of the circle of life, the way of the jungle.

02:27.772 --> 02:31.604
The distractions were,
like me, short-lived.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.608
See you later, dude.

02:33.737 --> 02:36.192
There was no real escape.

02:46.458 --> 02:50.918
It's one o'clock in the fucking morning.
What's so fucking important for fuck's sake?

02:51.046 --> 02:53.797
Can you use that word one more time?

02:53.923 --> 02:57.423
- I was out like a light when you called.
- You weren't.

02:57.552 --> 03:01.846
I heard your microwave ding in the background.
What were you heating up?

03:03.058 --> 03:08.099
I like popcorn. I like to watch
old black-and-white movies and eat popcorn.

03:08.229 --> 03:12.523
- I was in some of those movies.
- Which ones?

03:12.650 --> 03:16.351
Oh... Too many to recount.

03:16.488 --> 03:21.066
A lot of background, like so many of us...

03:22.035 --> 03:24.573
.. but memorable.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.531
I was beautiful.

03:26.664 --> 03:30.199
I'm sure you were brilliant.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.411
Can I get some coffee, please?

03:33.546 --> 03:36.962
Kiffany, make a fresh pot. We're here awhile.

03:39.636 --> 03:43.680
Oh, please tell me
those are not what I think they are.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.511
It is. They are.

03:46.643 --> 03:51.471
- Time for your self-evaluations.
- Again?

03:51.606 --> 03:54.097
I don't believe this.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.852
Please. It's one o'clock in the morning.
I do have a life.

03:57.987 --> 04:02.281
One o'clock's about the right time.
You're not so well defended at night.

04:02.409 --> 04:07.699
OK, look... As always, multiple choice
in the test books, essays in the blue books.

04:07.831 --> 04:11.531
Mason, please write legibly.
There were complaints last year.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.752
That's ridiculous.
I always have high marks for penmanship.

04:14.879 --> 04:18.628
You write like you speak.
I could barely understand a word.

04:18.757 --> 04:24.927
Oh, you know what? In all honesty, I was
on something when I filled out my form last year.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.808
- Are you on something tonight?
- No.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.725
For real?

04:29.853 --> 04:33.933
- Well, a little bit.
- Rube, I think there's been a mistake.

04:34.065 --> 04:40.483
I completed one of these in New York
just before I left, so I don't need to be here.

04:40.613 --> 04:44.528
You know the difference between
a New York hotdog and a Chicago hotdog?

04:44.659 --> 04:48.491
- I don't eat...
- The New York has mustard, ketchup,

04:48.621 --> 04:50.910
served with a tomato-based onion relish.

04:51.041 --> 04:56.830
In Chicago, it's... It's a great fucking town.
It comes on a poppy-seed bun,

04:56.963 --> 04:59.798
mustard, emerald relish,

04:59.924 --> 05:04.503
tomatoes, pickles, onions, celery salt...

05:05.513 --> 05:07.589
.. then you got chilli peppers.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.099
It is a very different experience.

05:12.228 --> 05:16.012
I wouldn't eat either of those.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.023
Death, Daisy...

05:19.235 --> 05:22.071
.. it has a different quality in New York...

05:22.197 --> 05:26.029
.. as it does in Chicago, New Orleans,

05:26.159 --> 05:27.986
Destin, Florida,

05:28.119 --> 05:31.369
Lusk, Wyoming... everywhere.

05:31.498 --> 05:35.365
Death is just a little different than it is here.

05:35.502 --> 05:39.713
Whoever's gonna read this
wants to know if you're right for this town.

05:39.839 --> 05:44.916
If you don't want to be here,
they'll find some other place for you.

05:45.679 --> 05:49.842
OK. You have an hour for section one

05:49.974 --> 05:53.308
or as much time as you need.

05:53.436 --> 05:57.434
I'm here. You guys are over here.
Come on. Let's go.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.891
Take everything with you.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.519
- Here, take this.
- So you're aware,

06:03.655 --> 06:05.778
this is some freeze-dried bullshit.

06:05.907 --> 06:08.398
The clock's running, OK?

06:08.535 --> 06:10.492
Wasting my time!

06:10.620 --> 06:12.577
I need more drugs.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.674
Bet they're all asleep.

06:38.606 --> 06:42.225
The essay questions are the same as last year,
so...

06:42.360 --> 06:43.985
Sweet.

06:45.030 --> 06:50.451
This one's different.
"If your life were a colour, what would it be?"

06:51.494 --> 06:52.905
Black.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.070
Black.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.583
Black.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.164
No... pink.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.881
You folks better simmer down
and start thinking.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.336
Writing.

07:10.889 --> 07:16.725
- There are three essay questions.
- No. Tell me there are not three, please.

07:16.853 --> 07:21.349
And the short answers are in two parts.

07:21.483 --> 07:26.026
Sharpen another pencil
and I'm breaking one in your little pink ass.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.695
OK. Triple espresso?

07:34.120 --> 07:36.528
Peanut butter protein shake

07:36.664 --> 07:39.500
and tomato juice with lemon and ginseng.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.125
Wow, you guys are up too, huh?

07:45.882 --> 07:47.460
Shh!

07:50.261 --> 07:54.045
- What are you doing?
- Georgia, go away.

07:55.225 --> 08:00.646
- Did you get together to vote me off the island?
- Get the fuck out while you still can.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.848
Daisy, give me my pencil back.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.482
- Get off!
- How many souls did you take last month?

08:06.611 --> 08:10.146
A lot. Like, over 40.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.023
Wow!

08:12.659 --> 08:16.110
- You must be exhausted.
- To the bone, baby.

08:16.246 --> 08:24.254
The next Post-it he gives me gets shoved
up his butt. No disrespect, but I am T-I-R-E-D.

08:24.379 --> 08:28.079
There's no hobnobbing.
It's not a debutante party.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.302
Separate booths, OK? Let's go.

08:32.429 --> 08:35.429
Georgia, come here, please.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.679
Georgia!

08:41.395 --> 08:45.310
- Have a seat. Why are you here?
- I couldn't sleep.

08:45.442 --> 08:50.068
- Why is everyone taking a test and I'm not?
- I think I'll take up painting.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.189
What are they doing?

08:52.323 --> 08:54.446
Their self-evaluations.

08:54.576 --> 08:57.031
Maybe watercolour to start.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.238
Maybe acrylic.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.208
- Why are you here?
- I could not fall asleep.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.956
Why am I not doing what they're doing?

09:06.087 --> 09:10.714
You're doing what you're doing. When
it's time to do something else, you'll do that.

09:10.842 --> 09:14.045
I want to learn to paint. I need a mentor.

09:14.179 --> 09:17.133
As you can imagine, all the good ones are dead.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.349
You don't think that I could do a self-evaluation?

09:20.477 --> 09:24.426
I am a very impressive young worker.
Ask anyone at Happy Time.

09:24.564 --> 09:28.811
Ask Delores. She really loves me.

09:28.943 --> 09:32.395
- You're very well liked here.
- I am?

09:32.530 --> 09:35.864
Absolutely. How do you feel about filing?

09:35.992 --> 09:39.942
I like the way you show initiative. I like it a lot.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.199
I'd better watch my back. You'll have my job.

09:43.333 --> 09:47.413
I envy you. Collating is so Zen.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.001
Isn't responsibility fun?

09:50.131 --> 09:57.261
I went through a rough patch at your age.
It was the '80s and everyone was doing cocaine.

09:57.389 --> 10:00.306
Hi! How's The Little Engine That Could?

10:00.433 --> 10:04.597
My heart... swells with such pride!

10:06.189 --> 10:08.976
This isn't Happy Time, sweetheart.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.478
- You don't do one this time around.
- Why?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.771
- Because you don't.
- Why?

10:14.906 --> 10:17.231
- You just don't.
- Why?

10:17.367 --> 10:19.988
"Why?" That's a question.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.448
Want to split a carrot muffin?

10:24.582 --> 10:26.456
No? Fine.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.826
I'll do it alone.

10:28.962 --> 10:32.794
Take Monet. Impressionist.

10:33.842 --> 10:36.130
Here's his painting of Rouen Cathedral.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.803
Stunning.

10:39.931 --> 10:45.934
But at the same time, it doesn't convey
the atmospheric reality of the cathedral.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.768
It's more like a dream of the cathedral.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.893
Eyes on your own work.

10:54.779 --> 10:59.406
So I have to ask,
do I want to paint dreams? Do I, Georgia?

10:59.534 --> 11:01.610
I don't know. I don't care.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.449
Why can't I take the test?

11:04.581 --> 11:07.368
Can I get some coffee, please?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.374
I could paint dreams.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.542
I could really eat a muffin.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.052
T-bone steak and eggs,
T-bone medium-rare, eggs over-easy,

11:18.178 --> 11:21.132
toast instead of hash browns
and syrup for the pancakes.

11:21.264 --> 11:25.214
Do not skimp on the butter.
And some bacon, extra crispy.

11:25.352 --> 11:29.183
I'll never understand
the instinct to miniaturise food.

11:29.314 --> 11:32.184
- It's bite-size.
- It's not bite-size.

11:32.317 --> 11:35.982
I can't eat this.
Now I'm sticky. Can I have a napkin?

11:36.112 --> 11:38.438
- You ate three.
- I didn't. Thank you.

11:38.573 --> 11:43.116
As an undead person, I have certain privileges.
For instance, I have a physical body.

11:43.244 --> 11:47.705
I can enjoy the sweet deliciousness
of this tasty key lime pie.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.368
Don't you want your bacon?

12:05.100 --> 12:08.718
I love eggs. I love 'em fried,
scrambled, boiled, Florentine...

12:08.853 --> 12:13.350
These I didn't love,
so who do we blame, the hen or the cook?

12:15.360 --> 12:16.558
Let's blame the hen.

12:16.695 --> 12:19.446
You don't know what a patty melt is?

12:19.572 --> 12:22.858
"Patty melt" defines what it is
and how it's prepared.

12:22.992 --> 12:27.370
- The cheese is melted on the patty.
- I like the cheese melted on the bread.

12:27.497 --> 12:30.284
That'd be a bread melt or grilled cheese.

12:30.417 --> 12:34.461
Corned beef hash. I speak for myself
and for aficionados of the dish:

12:34.587 --> 12:37.423
it's to be fried with a crisp exterior.

12:37.549 --> 12:42.674
I do not say this phrase lightly
in this hallowed place...

12:42.804 --> 12:44.713
.. but this is fucking inedible.

12:44.848 --> 12:49.391
A dish is a collection of flavours, consistencies.

12:49.519 --> 12:54.893
You start swapping ingredients in this mélange,
you're fucking with a Jenga tower of taste.

12:56.359 --> 13:00.653
Can I get a carrot muffin on the grill,
extra butter?

13:02.490 --> 13:08.196
"What are the gifts
that you bring to your organisation?"

13:09.539 --> 13:10.702
Hmm...

13:10.832 --> 13:15.660
You know your problem? You're always
wondering what the world's going to do for you,

13:15.795 --> 13:19.211
wondering who's gonna kiss your ass
and make you happy,

13:19.341 --> 13:22.756
when you should just thank God for another day.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.044
You can take the lighter one...

13:26.139 --> 13:30.718
Sir, I'm gonna say this
as politely as possible: I will fuck you up.

13:30.852 --> 13:34.897
Do I need to be crossing over,
passing on or something?

13:35.023 --> 13:38.143
You ain't goin' nowhere until I fill my quota.

13:43.865 --> 13:47.732
Let me tell you something.
I am trying to do my job.

13:47.869 --> 13:51.320
If you fuck with me,
there are skills I can employ

13:51.456 --> 13:54.825
that would give your life a turn for the painful.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.375
These brats egged my car.
I was gonna beat their ass.

13:58.505 --> 14:02.799
Then this bitch comes up to me: 25-dollar ticket.
"So? Pay the damn ticket!"

14:02.926 --> 14:05.333
This has been a fucked-up week.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.516
No nonsense...

14:09.641 --> 14:12.595
.. comfortable with firearms...

14:12.727 --> 14:14.969
.. and I know Kung Fu.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.813
"What, in your previous experience,

14:16.940 --> 14:21.317
would help you to convince the living
that you are one of them?"

14:22.362 --> 14:25.067
I am a sucker for platinum.

14:27.909 --> 14:33.200
I had Dorothy's original bike from The Wizard of
Oz. I knew someone from the props department.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.703
You mean you blew somebody
in the props department.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.292
Knew, blew... tomayto, tomahto.

14:37.419 --> 14:41.333
I once gave Errol Flynn a hand job
in a convertible.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.042
That's a nice story.

14:44.175 --> 14:47.461
The star of the movie and I were quite the item.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.671
Hang on. You and Clark Gable?

14:49.806 --> 14:54.385
Uh-huh. I was under the craft services table,
blowing this tall, handsome man,

14:54.519 --> 14:59.430
then someone whispered in my ear,
"No, that's Clark Gable."

14:59.566 --> 15:02.899
- I did once blow Babe Ruth.
- Who didn't?

15:03.028 --> 15:06.064
- So who were you blowing?
- I don't know!

15:06.197 --> 15:09.613
It was such a huge cast.
A Confederate, I think.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.234
Did you ever sleep with a dwarf?

15:12.370 --> 15:14.992
Don't be stupid. They're cartoons.

15:17.959 --> 15:23.380
"I... am... an... actress."

15:24.716 --> 15:29.212
"What kind of coping skills
do you possess in pressure situations?"

15:35.018 --> 15:36.892
Move.

15:40.815 --> 15:46.604
All right, pull your pants down and bend over.
You have to lean into me.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.033
Are you high?

15:54.954 --> 15:58.288
I've got illegals in my bottom.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.999
- Why do you do this to yourself?
- I don't know!

16:03.963 --> 16:07.629
Do you consider yourself to be exceptionally
reasonable or exceptionally kind?

16:07.759 --> 16:11.591
Exceptionally kind.
I'm not particularly reasonable.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.774
Ah! Ah!

16:23.900 --> 16:27.814
- Where are you going?
- I'm getting the fuck out of here!

16:34.786 --> 16:36.862
"Poised under pressure."

16:38.957 --> 16:42.622
Daisy, another writing instrument, please.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.664
Pencil.

16:57.851 --> 17:01.017
You should paint like these guys,
like Impressionists.

17:02.397 --> 17:05.896
You're eating my muffin. Is it good?

17:06.026 --> 17:08.980
Mmm. It's really good.

17:09.112 --> 17:12.481
As remarkable as they are,
I don't want to paint them.

17:12.615 --> 17:15.866
Why? Too much light?

17:21.249 --> 17:23.869
I'd rather do something a little darker.

17:24.919 --> 17:27.671
Maybe a nightscape.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.873
Hold on.

17:33.762 --> 17:36.217
Now, there we have something.

17:37.474 --> 17:40.143
Edward Hopper.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.557
Look at you.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.357
I'm dead, I'm not stupid.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.491
She reminds me of Daisy.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.786
Daisy's not this contemplative.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.163
You're wrong.

18:08.296 --> 18:14.216
I live with her. I watch her sometimes
when she doesn't think anyone's looking.

18:15.553 --> 18:18.127
She's sad about something.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.396
Nighthawks.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.932
I wonder what they're thinking about.

18:34.531 --> 18:37.532
Oi, come here.

18:39.786 --> 18:44.578
- Probably themselves.
- I don't know. Maybe someone else.

18:47.168 --> 18:48.793
Something else.

18:52.716 --> 18:54.792
I'll be right back.

18:55.844 --> 19:00.007
"Which of the following
best describes the ideal workplace?"

19:00.140 --> 19:03.639
- What?
- Wait. "A: a nurse in an emergency room,

19:03.768 --> 19:07.813
B: a lifeguard at the beach,
C: a night watchman in an industrial park?"

19:07.939 --> 19:11.438
- Is there a problem?
- No.

19:11.568 --> 19:14.059
I was just thanking Kiffany for the beverage.

19:14.195 --> 19:20.150
The lifeguard. You sit on your ass and
just make sure everything's OK. That'd be nice.

19:21.703 --> 19:24.538
What? What did...? Lifeguard?

19:24.664 --> 19:28.163
Kiffany, I've got a lot of work to do here.

19:28.293 --> 19:34.497
In all honesty, I cannot sit here and discuss
whatever axe you have to grind with lifeguards.

19:36.676 --> 19:40.010
One warning, Mason. Consider yourself warned.

19:40.889 --> 19:43.843
She's piss-drunk. Look at her. She's hammered.

19:57.572 --> 20:00.110
Looks like they're thinking
about something they lost.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.363
No, no, no...

20:04.412 --> 20:06.321
Hopper's the guy.

20:11.586 --> 20:14.124
Why are they taking this test at night?

20:15.840 --> 20:18.628
- And why are you here?
- Why are you here?

20:18.760 --> 20:20.966
I can't sleep.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.387
I have a job this morning.

20:28.103 --> 20:30.890
I have to go.

20:31.022 --> 20:33.311
Oh.

20:33.441 --> 20:36.727
- Want company?
- No.

20:36.861 --> 20:41.108
I don't mind, really.
It's not like I'm doing anything.

20:41.241 --> 20:45.321
Oi...
What did you put for number 12?

20:46.705 --> 20:48.781
Where is it, the job?

20:53.253 --> 20:55.376
Oh, motherfuck...

20:55.505 --> 20:57.663
Jesus. Fucking test...

21:07.017 --> 21:10.516
It's 3851 Beatrice Lane.

21:10.645 --> 21:14.559
- It's not your Post-it.
- That's my old house, where my family is!

21:14.691 --> 21:15.889
I'm aware.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.899
Well... who is it?

21:18.028 --> 21:20.435
It's not your Post-it.

21:20.572 --> 21:25.732
- There are rules, Georgia.
- What is going to happen in my driveway?

21:25.869 --> 21:27.945
It's not your driveway any more.

21:28.079 --> 21:30.997
- You know what I mean.
- I do...

21:31.791 --> 21:34.329
.. but it's not your driveway any more.

21:34.461 --> 21:37.877
- Then I'm coming with you.
- That's not going to happen.

21:38.006 --> 21:42.004
Someone dies at my house,
and you don't tell me about it?

21:42.135 --> 21:45.255
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

21:47.182 --> 21:49.258
Everything all right?

21:49.851 --> 21:54.145
Everything's fine. Another sliver
of pecan pie for my friend here.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.806
Warm it up. Thanks.

21:58.943 --> 22:04.186
Whoever's on this Post-it, you can't do
anything about it. Now sit your ass down...

22:04.324 --> 22:05.783
.. now.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.288
Excuse me?

22:14.959 --> 22:21.329
What's the first thought
that enters your head when you finish a job?

22:21.466 --> 22:26.626
- What?
- What is the first thought

22:26.763 --> 22:30.096
that enters your head when you...

22:30.225 --> 22:32.632
when you finish a job?

22:34.771 --> 22:36.146
I...

22:37.273 --> 22:39.847
I hope they're happy.

22:41.820 --> 22:43.896
Wow!

22:44.030 --> 22:45.489
That's lovely.

22:52.080 --> 22:55.947
This is so supremely fucked up.

22:56.084 --> 22:58.657
It's late. You're tired.

22:58.795 --> 23:02.211
What is this? Why are you doing this to me?

23:03.383 --> 23:06.218
I didn't decide someone's gonna die
on your driveway.

23:06.344 --> 23:09.262
It's not always about you, Georgia.

23:09.389 --> 23:14.549
Why don't you have a little piece of pie,
take a look at this book?

23:14.686 --> 23:16.892
Take a look at the paintings.

23:19.482 --> 23:22.649
The world is a very big place...

23:22.777 --> 23:26.857
.. and you, young lady, are not the centre of it.

23:26.990 --> 23:30.074
Fuck your book...

23:30.201 --> 23:33.072
.. and fuck your world.

23:35.707 --> 23:41.211
You have a problem with the rules, young lady,
which means you have a problem with me.

23:44.049 --> 23:46.041
Better yet,

23:46.176 --> 23:49.342
I have got a problem with you.

23:50.805 --> 23:54.091
Well, you really fucked the dog, peanut.

23:54.225 --> 23:56.301
I didn't make an appointment.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.974
You had an appointment.

23:59.105 --> 24:02.723
Correct me if I'm wrong but...
mission accomplished.

24:02.859 --> 24:05.813
You're wrong. That was me correcting you.

24:05.945 --> 24:11.865
Um... I forgot to tell you, my last guy didn't
show up. Just thought you might want to know.

24:11.993 --> 24:15.279
- What's the soup today?
- Cream of bullshit.

24:15.413 --> 24:17.785
- You piss me off too.
- I piss you off?

24:17.916 --> 24:21.664
Do me a favour,
pretend you've rethought this little lie.

24:21.795 --> 24:24.546
You've had an epiphany, grown the fuck up.

24:24.673 --> 24:28.172
Life and death can be simple.
Just do what I tell you.

24:28.301 --> 24:31.587
Stay on his good side.
He's like a volcano, George.

24:31.721 --> 24:33.844
He erupts and spews lava,

24:33.973 --> 24:38.137
and all the little villagers,
they run around for their lives.

24:39.312 --> 24:44.058
But he stops and you can go back
to the safety of your own home.

24:44.192 --> 24:46.268
How long is he gonna stay mad?

24:47.320 --> 24:50.072
- Do you not like me any more?
- Not this minute.

24:50.198 --> 24:52.771
You're a constipator. You disturb my shit.

24:52.909 --> 24:56.278
Do you really care how it's going with me?

24:56.413 --> 25:01.999
Sure. I make my face look like this,
and the concerned words come out.

25:02.127 --> 25:04.119
You're a real... dickweed.

25:04.254 --> 25:08.252
What you're feeling right now,
the rage and frustration all knotted together,

25:08.383 --> 25:13.128
binding everything from your head
to your digestive tract, that's my life with you.

25:15.473 --> 25:19.471
- You have a problem with me?
- Yes, ma'am, I do.

25:19.602 --> 25:22.971
And one thing you should know
about me by now,

25:23.106 --> 25:25.941
I am a problem-solver.

25:26.067 --> 25:28.356
How do I put this delicately?

25:28.486 --> 25:30.812
Does this concern you?

25:34.242 --> 25:36.911
Try and choose your words carefully.

25:39.039 --> 25:41.197
Blow me.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.542
I wasn't scared of Rube.

25:52.677 --> 25:56.177
I wasn't much scared of anything.
I was a reaper.

25:56.306 --> 25:58.678
I was near death all the time.

26:01.269 --> 26:04.519
But now, tonight, this morning,

26:04.647 --> 26:07.684
it was in my front yard.

26:13.782 --> 26:17.198
Who was going to die in my driveway?

26:20.455 --> 26:22.531
One Arnold Palmer.

26:22.665 --> 26:24.325
Thank you.

26:26.211 --> 26:29.295
Like I said, thank you.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.416
Do you need anything else?

26:32.550 --> 26:37.378
Um... No, I'm cool
with my lemonade iced-tea mixture here.

26:37.514 --> 26:39.637
I meant, do you need help?

26:39.766 --> 26:43.301
Wh... What do you mean, do I need help?

26:43.436 --> 26:45.595
Oh, the others,

26:45.730 --> 26:48.352
the other two, they seemed to need help.

26:48.483 --> 26:50.808
With the questions.

26:52.737 --> 26:54.979
I know things.

26:55.115 --> 26:57.154
Uh...

26:58.618 --> 27:01.192
I'm cool by myself.

27:01.329 --> 27:03.405
But thank you.

27:20.056 --> 27:21.254
Mason!

27:23.309 --> 27:24.554
Fucking cheater!

27:32.736 --> 27:34.645
I'm leaving.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.815
I'll be back.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.400
- Just try to be honest.
- OK.

27:43.538 --> 27:46.290
Not for me. I don't really care.

28:15.403 --> 28:18.073
Go back to bed, Mom.

28:18.198 --> 28:22.242
- Can you balance, George?
- Mom, I can do this. Hands off!

28:23.286 --> 28:25.528
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

28:25.663 --> 28:27.822
I'm never coming back!

28:40.887 --> 28:42.630
This sucks!

28:52.691 --> 28:55.312
Georgia, you are not six years old.

28:55.443 --> 28:59.655
18 years of coddling is enough for you,
young lady.

28:59.781 --> 29:04.110
If you think you can spend your life
suckling at my retirement fund,

29:04.244 --> 29:06.699
you've got another thing coming.

29:06.830 --> 29:09.617
Get out of bed and go to work.

29:09.749 --> 29:15.170
You will collect a pay check and
you will move out of this house. Understood?

29:23.638 --> 29:25.714
How did your daughter die?

29:27.350 --> 29:30.351
I don't want to have this conversation with you.

29:30.478 --> 29:34.262
Well... what was she like?

29:37.152 --> 29:38.860
Why do you care?

29:40.780 --> 29:43.781
I just think it's cool she had the doll.

29:43.908 --> 29:46.031
Frankenfruity is the shit.

29:49.539 --> 29:52.208
She drove me crazy, to tell the truth.

29:52.334 --> 29:54.540
What?

29:54.669 --> 29:57.160
She was stubborn.

29:57.297 --> 30:00.500
I think that's only because she was smart.

30:00.633 --> 30:03.089
Probably too smart.

30:04.262 --> 30:09.636
She figured a lot of things out
way before her friends, that's for sure.

30:12.687 --> 30:15.392
We never really got along.

30:16.983 --> 30:20.103
I don't think I was a very good mother.

31:02.821 --> 31:06.901
I actually think
it's nicer for the people at the beach.

31:07.033 --> 31:10.698
- What?
- That lifeguard thing.

31:10.829 --> 31:14.743
I think it's nice to be at the beach
with your children

31:14.874 --> 31:18.493
and to see you sitting up there
in your red trunks,

31:18.628 --> 31:25.710
like, "What the hell?
If he's here, I'm going in that water."

31:28.888 --> 31:31.047
Yeah.

31:31.641 --> 31:33.515
More coffee?

31:54.080 --> 31:56.405
Back to normal.

31:57.959 --> 32:00.664
Let's just pretend...

32:02.172 --> 32:04.248
.. everything is back to normal.

32:08.970 --> 32:12.137
So let's just pretend that we have a normal child.

32:12.932 --> 32:15.602
Urgh! Gross!

32:15.727 --> 32:20.188
And she's lost. She lives in her head.

32:20.315 --> 32:22.722
God knows what's in there. She's inscrutable.

32:22.859 --> 32:27.901
Every time I talk to you,
I feel like we're these little rats in a cage,

32:28.031 --> 32:33.452
and we keep touching that goddamn bar,
and we keep getting shocked.

32:33.578 --> 32:35.405
Reggie, open the door!

32:35.538 --> 32:38.160
Go away! I have diarrhoea.

32:38.291 --> 32:40.414
How do you know it was her?

32:44.964 --> 32:47.040
Do you miss your daughter?

32:49.928 --> 32:53.131
When... When she was younger...

32:54.265 --> 32:56.756
.. we'd been very close.

32:57.644 --> 33:00.811
I thought the bond could never be broken.

33:00.939 --> 33:05.601
But it was... almost effortlessly. I...

33:05.735 --> 33:09.899
I didn't know that was all the time we'd have.

33:10.031 --> 33:13.614
Don't you think we ought to talk to her before...

33:13.743 --> 33:19.746
"We"? As in you who's never here
and me whose lap all this crap gets dumped on?

33:19.874 --> 33:21.748
This is a lost cause.

33:23.044 --> 33:26.828
- Well, maybe we should split up.
- Oh, that's great.

33:26.965 --> 33:29.634
That's great.

33:29.759 --> 33:33.971
You go, but you better
find yourself one hell of a lawyer.

33:35.432 --> 33:38.302
Split up to find the dog.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.013
Oh.

33:45.025 --> 33:46.982
That's a good idea.

33:49.571 --> 33:54.565
The last time
I sat on this porch, I was an 18-year-old girl.

33:54.701 --> 33:57.571
It was a pretty summer morning.

33:57.704 --> 34:00.195
I was wearing overalls.

34:13.678 --> 34:16.003
THE MASTER PAINTERS

34:50.507 --> 34:52.583
Something to keep you warm?

34:53.967 --> 34:55.427
Thanks.

34:58.807 --> 35:01.013
Why are you here?

35:02.519 --> 35:06.303
To find out if someone
in my family is on your Post-it.

35:06.439 --> 35:08.930
That's why, asshole.

35:10.694 --> 35:14.940
If you knew who was on this Post-it,
could you stop it?

35:17.367 --> 35:18.861
Maybe.

35:21.621 --> 35:23.827
No one you know will die tonight.

35:27.419 --> 35:30.622
Why are you doing this to me?

35:32.215 --> 35:35.251
If you knew who it was, could you stop it?

35:39.931 --> 35:41.390
No.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.011
No.

35:46.229 --> 35:48.471
You can't.

35:53.153 --> 35:55.726
I can't sleep.

35:58.742 --> 36:01.197
Why can't I sleep?

36:05.081 --> 36:07.751
You stand too close to a painting...

36:10.086 --> 36:12.873
.. all you see are patches of colour.

36:14.382 --> 36:18.166
Stand too far back,
you can't see any of the detail.

36:20.889 --> 36:24.424
Right now, this is your particular perspective.

36:27.437 --> 36:29.513
And if you ask me...

36:35.653 --> 36:38.524
I'm a little too close.

36:38.656 --> 36:40.032
Yes.

36:44.913 --> 36:47.534
I don't know why I'm here.

36:51.252 --> 36:54.953
I guess to see if everyone's OK. I don't know.

36:56.466 --> 36:58.838
I really don't know.

36:58.968 --> 37:00.842
I'm just...

37:02.639 --> 37:04.715
I'm so tired.

37:09.020 --> 37:11.096
Are they OK?

37:15.944 --> 37:18.269
I don't know.

37:18.405 --> 37:20.528
I really can't see.

37:21.700 --> 37:24.700
Drink your coffee, peanut, before it gets cold.

37:41.553 --> 37:45.171
"Why are you here?"

37:47.058 --> 37:49.347
Why the fuck am I here?

37:53.982 --> 37:56.307
"Why are you here?"

38:15.128 --> 38:17.666
- It's the milkman!
- Yeah. Looks that way.

38:18.715 --> 38:22.131
- What did he ever do to anyone?
- I don't know.

38:22.260 --> 38:24.549
Somebody sure is gonna fuck the milkman.

38:28.933 --> 38:30.178
Morning.

38:30.310 --> 38:32.765
Morning. You're up early.

38:32.896 --> 38:34.972
Nice time of day... night.

38:35.106 --> 38:38.107
- I don't know what it is.
- A quiet time.

38:38.234 --> 38:41.935
- Yeah.
- Makes you feel a little apart from things,

38:42.072 --> 38:45.690
like you're in the world but not of it.

38:46.826 --> 38:49.317
Hmm... I'll say.

38:50.955 --> 38:54.371
- You got a nice round here, huh?
- Sure. It's great.

38:54.501 --> 38:58.083
Nice families.
Getting to watch the sun rise all by yourself.

38:58.213 --> 39:00.538
That's its own reward.

39:00.674 --> 39:04.422
It's real pretty even when it's still dark out.

39:04.552 --> 39:07.304
- You know?
- Yeah.

39:07.430 --> 39:09.055
It sure is.

39:22.320 --> 39:25.072
- Sorry about that.
- That's OK.

39:25.198 --> 39:27.274
I'll get it.

39:44.759 --> 39:47.594
I think you're gonna like the new route.

39:47.721 --> 39:51.339
He wasn't anyone I knew,
and it was still hard.

39:52.767 --> 39:54.843
Everybody OK in there?

39:58.648 --> 40:00.356
See you later.

40:04.738 --> 40:10.277
- So, you a two-per-cent guy?
- No, whole milk all the way.

40:10.410 --> 40:13.411
- Two per cent's for sissies.
- Yeah.

40:14.456 --> 40:16.532
How's your cholesterol?

40:19.753 --> 40:22.078
Hey, Rube! Wait up!

40:41.649 --> 40:43.726
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

40:43.860 --> 40:47.940
- Good night, Daisy.
- Thanks for a wonderful evening.

40:54.162 --> 40:57.863
I think I'm going to start a painting tomorrow.

40:57.999 --> 41:00.075
It is tomorrow.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.711
Maybe today.

41:06.299 --> 41:07.628
Hey, bub.

41:07.759 --> 41:10.546
Hey, get me a cup of black coffee

41:10.679 --> 41:14.130
and some cinnamon toast...

42:06.305 --> 42:12.532
