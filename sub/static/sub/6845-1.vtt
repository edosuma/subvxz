Hey.

08:19.511 --> 08:21.077
I am killing it over here.

08:21.113 --> 08:23.647
You're only discounting
everything 25%, right?

08:23.682 --> 08:26.583
Yeah, "scan, "reassign,"
"yes," "override,"

08:26.618 --> 08:27.584
"yes," "reprice..."

08:27.619 --> 08:29.486
- Reduce.
- Huh?

08:29.521 --> 08:30.620
Reduce 0.25.

08:30.656 --> 08:31.988
Reprice 0.25?

We can all learn a lesson here.

10:12.708 --> 10:14.174
Would that lesson be not letting Jonah

10:14.210 --> 10:15.976

10:16.912 --> 10:18.512
It might be, yes.

All right. Punctuality.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.816

10:52.581 --> 10:53.914
to stack a few cans.

10:53.949 --> 10:56.383
I just... I wanted to reiterate

how sorry I am about before.

10:58.220 --> 11:00.921
And when a customer wants
a can of ginger root beer

11:00.956 --> 11:02.756
and the whole thing
collapses on top of them,

11:02.791 --> 11:04.658

11:07.096 --> 11:08.629
I was just trying to have some fun.

11:08.664 --> 11:10.931
This might be a cultural
thing, but around here,

11:10.966 --> 11:13.000

up you do, the better.

You talking about the cans
or the pricing thing?

11:14.970 --> 11:16.603
You see, the fact that
it's your first day

11:16.639 --> 11:18.172
and there's already
more than one option

11:18.207 --> 11:19.873
of things you screwed
up is not a good thing.

11:19.909 --> 11:21.475
Okay, I've made some mistakes.

I can admit that, but that doesn't mean

fun at work, does it?

11:27.616 --> 11:29.149
Wait, I'm sorry.

phrase "moments of beauty,"

was in the dressing rooms,

14:20.490 --> 14:23.224
Ten years of long days, actually.

14:26.163 --> 14:30.065

14:30.100 --> 14:33.001
every single year for the
back-to-school sale.

14:33.036 --> 14:34.636
And then I take them down,

14:34.671 --> 14:37.005
and I put up the Halloween inventory,

14:37.040 --> 14:38.740
and then Thanksgiving and Christmas

14:38.775 --> 14:41.309
and Valentine's Day and Easter

14:41.344 --> 14:42.811
and Fourth of July,

14:42.846 --> 14:45.280
and then back-to-school again.

14:45.315 --> 14:46.548
Hmm.

14:46.583 --> 14:49.384
That sounds incredibly not fun.

be just like today,

14:56.727 --> 14:57.792
and I know that

14:57.828 --> 15:00.528
because today is just like yesterday.

15:00.564 --> 15:03.932
So... sometimes...

15:03.967 --> 15:06.768

17:16.031 --> 17:17.665
Okay, if you like what
you heard and saw,

17:17.701 --> 17:20.300
I'm currently seeking
representation in all areas.

17:20.337 --> 17:21.603
Also, I do modeling,

17:21.637 --> 17:23.137
so I'm just throwing that out there.

17:23.173 --> 17:25.240
All right, peace out, St. Louis.

17:25.275 --> 17:26.406
M-m-murr!

17:26.443 --> 17:28.242
- Bo.
- What?

17:28.278 --> 17:30.178
Oh, my bad, yo.

[clears throat]

17:33.083 --> 17:35.250
Cheyenne Tyler Lee,

17:35.285 --> 17:37.185
will you marry me?

17:37.220 --> 17:39.921
Or are you gonna be,
like, a dick about it?

17:39.956 --> 17:41.856
Oh, I think he's about
to shoot a hostage.

17:41.892 --> 17:43.658
- I'll do what I can.

18:19.529 --> 18:21.763
May your marriage be
as sweet and colorful

18:21.798 --> 18:24.499
as this Cloud 9 brand
caffeinated malt beverage,

18:24.534 --> 18:26.968
without the recall for
killing college students.

18:27.003 --> 18:30.138
Thank you, on behalf of myself and Bo.

[indistinct radio chatter]

18:31.374 --> 18:33.308
Well, he did make it memorable.

18:33.343 --> 18:34.642
I'll give him that.

18:34.678 --> 18:36.344
I mean, most guys don't even bother

18:36.379 --> 18:38.146
threatening to kill you
when they propose.

18:38.181 --> 18:39.781
You were never in any real danger.

18:39.816 --> 18:40.882
You know that, right?

18:40.917 --> 18:43.151
Yeah, I know. It was a fake robbery.

18:43.186 --> 18:45.586
This is a high-velocity 440-grain lead

18:45.622 --> 18:47.322
flat-nose projectile with gas checks

18:47.357 --> 18:49.590
and a boxer-primed brass jacket.

18:49.626 --> 18:50.892
If he'd come within 10 feet of you,

18:50.927 --> 18:53.027
you would have seen his head
explode like a watermelon.

Cleanup on aisle...

18:55.966 --> 18:57.231
I don't even know what aisle it is,

18:57.267 --> 18:59.100

19:02.872 --> 19:04.305
Oh, shoot.

19:04.341 --> 19:07.108
You know, I wish that we
could wear jewelry at work.

19:07.143 --> 19:09.277
Oh, it's so...

19:09.312 --> 19:10.912
sparkly.

19:10.947 --> 19:12.714
You know, I thought about what you said

19:12.749 --> 19:15.616
about not doing something
that I might regret,

19:15.652 --> 19:20.455
but then, in the moment,
you know, under the stars,

19:20.490 --> 19:22.190
it just felt right.

19:22.225 --> 19:24.192
Without you, I would
have never said yes,

Oh.

Well, I should go bail
out my boyfriend now.

Hey, I didn't mean to...

19:47.684 --> 19:50.818
That, in there...

19:50.854 --> 19:52.220
I just wanted today

19:52.255 --> 19:54.589
to feel different than yesterday.

19:54.624 --> 19:56.424
Well, then you completely failed,

19:56.459 --> 19:59.761
because that exact same
thing happened yesterday.

We're gonna throw some mannequin
limbs in the dumpster
