You two now comprise the royal guard

00:46.922 --> 00:47.923
That's me!

00:48.215 --> 00:51.970
As such, you may no longer
own property or operate children

00:51.969 --> 00:55.849
and must render all treasure and wives
unto your sworn princess

00:55.931 --> 00:57.228
within a hangman's fortnight.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.230
(SCOFFS) Joke's on you, man.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.604
We spent all our treasure the other day.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.360
Plus, don't even have any wives.

01:03.438 --> 01:07.193

- Lady's my girlfriend.

Wait, but...

That was Tree Trunks.

01:11.780 --> 01:12.952
Oh, yeah!

01:12.948 --> 01:16.703
We, the inhabitants of O00,
owe you heroes our very lives.

01:17.077 --> 01:20.331
As the once powerful

01:20.330 --> 01:22.332
<i>sulked off into exile,</i>

01:22.332 --> 01:26.963

01:29.464 --> 01:33.594
who aimed to eat the powerful comet
and grow invincible!

01:33.677 --> 01:36.351
And for that, we are eternally grateful.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.727
I know I am.

01:37.806 --> 01:41.436
But now your bravery is essential
to a new heroic task!

01:42.477 --> 01:43.603
Can you guess what it is?

01:44.229 --> 01:45.856
- Uh...
- Come on. Guess!

01:46.231 --> 01:48.859
Um... Fight a... Fight a dragon?

Wrong! Follow me.

Phew! (SIGHS)

I mean, except for this sweet armor, though.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.554
Nah. The armor's stupid, too.

Dang King of O00,
going around like DJ Snappy.

02:12.424 --> 02:15.678
This is it, fellas.
The only spot of the kingdom left unscoured

02:15.802 --> 02:17.179
during my treasure census.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.057
I'm afraid it'll explode
or something if I open it.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.559
But I really think there could...

02:21.558 --> 02:25.313
Nay, there might be
precious treasures in there,

02:25.312 --> 02:26.814
so I want you two to do it.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.571
Man, this seems like a really bad idea.

02:29.691 --> 02:33.070
Yeah, well, it's an order from your princess.
Git, git, git!

Uh, to proceed,
you must answer this ancient riddle.

- I forgot the riddle.
- That's okay.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.494
(SIGHS) Wait up.

03:19.741 --> 03:23.371
It's a dragon.
A candy dragon. Look.

03:23.370 --> 03:28.376
He sucks the vitamins from the roots,
and transforms it into candy juice.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.003
And then... And then,
the juice goes in all those drains.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.339
This... This is the lifeblood
of the whole kingdom!

03:45.100 --> 03:46.352
Go on.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.522
What are you talking about
with all this money talk?

03:49.521 --> 03:51.273
Yeah, why are you singing the money song?

03:51.273 --> 03:52.775
What, you don't see it?

03:52.899 --> 03:54.401
(CHUCKLES) They don't see it.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.407
Look, everyone needs juice to live, right?

03:56.528 --> 03:58.656
And I control the source of the juice.

03:58.655 --> 04:02.285
So by me charging a mere pittance
for every single drop,

04:02.284 --> 04:04.787
I can easily quadruple my treasure pile!

04:04.786 --> 04:06.914
Man, if you think
we're just gonna stand here and...

04:06.997 --> 04:09.921
KING OF OOO: Although...

04:09.916 --> 04:14.046
If this dragon thing
could pick up the pace a bit,

04:14.045 --> 04:17.766
we could have enough of a surplus left over
to export worldwide!

empire is finished.

04:34.900 --> 04:38.404
But the four of us will live like kings
till the juice runs out.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.907
What do ya say, boys? Let's...
Oh, I wonder where they ran off to.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.914
BOTH: Princess, Princess, Princess!
Princess, Princess, Princess, Princess!

04:47.996 --> 04:50.294
- Oh, hey, boys!
- FINN: Princess!

04:50.415 --> 04:54.420
Skliz is really blizzed up with the King of O00!
He really blizzed up all the skliz!

04:54.419 --> 04:56.171
He blizzed it all up, man.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.679
Yeah, well, maybe he should unblizz it, then.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.432
Why do I always got to unblizz everything?

05:02.511 --> 05:06.311
But, Princess, under the tree, there's...
There's a dragon, and he took the juice.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.186
(GASPS) Oh, no. This is all my fault!

05:10.310 --> 05:11.562

Princess? Princess, what is it?

05:16.316 --> 05:20.947
(SIGHS) That dragon you saw,
he's my brother, Neddy.

05:21.404 --> 05:24.328
- (BOTH GASP)
- What?

05:24.324 --> 05:28.579
We spawned together from the Mother Gum.
And now I'm all he has.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.334
(SQUAWKS)

05:33.416 --> 05:36.966
Neddy's very sensitive.
It's not safe for him out there.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.729
Okay, guys, Neddy's in this cave.

07:58.812 --> 08:02.862
I know because my Bod Rod here
is calibrated to our sister-brother bond.

08:02.941 --> 08:06.491
Now, people frighten him,
so I'm going in alone.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.864
If he tries to run, stop him.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.208
- I don't think we can, he's a giant...
- Yup!

08:11.616 --> 08:12.868
Thanks, guys!

08:14.869 --> 08:20.376
(SIGHS) This armor is driving me nuts!

08:20.709 --> 08:24.134
No way! I changed my mind.
I feel like a fancy shield.

08:24.212 --> 08:27.887
Or if I was like a dangerous candlestick.
Like, a knight's candlestick.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.890
You don't stretch, man.
This thing's crampin' my crimps!

08:31.011 --> 08:35.390
- (GRUNTING) Whoo!
- Dude, I don't like that.

Oh, no! I just want consistency!

09:52.092 --> 09:56.518
If the King of Ooo tries to come here again,
you have my secret permission to stop him.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.858
No holds barred...
Moosewood Stadium freestyle.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.022
So what are you two up to now?

10:02.018 --> 10:04.271
Eh, guarding stuff, I guess.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.777
Um... Hey, Bonnie?

10:06.898 --> 10:09.401
You always act like a... A loner, right?

10:09.526 --> 10:11.779
But next to your brother,
you're the light of the party.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.906
Sorry, the light of the party.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.410
I mean, yeah.

10:15.490 --> 10:18.164
One of the first things I did
after making sure Neddy was safe

10:18.159 --> 10:20.161
was to start making the Candy People.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.293
I was formed in the Mother Gum.

10:22.288 --> 10:26.919
My mind and my gum were in touch
with dozens of others like a crowded womb.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.298
I guess I miss that.

10:28.294 --> 10:32.800
But Neddy's from the same place you're from,
and he's a wet hot dog around everyone!

10:32.882 --> 10:34.680
People get built different.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.680
We don't need to figure it out,
we just need to respect it.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.432
Maybe he likes his own company
better than I like mine.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.935
Well, do you miss the Candy People?

10:47.063 --> 10:49.691
Hey, babaloos.
Good thing that juice is back on.

10:49.691 --> 10:54.447
I was making a mint, but, hoo, doggy,
my candles were starting to turn.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.827
- (LAUGHS) Thanks, Jake.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.701
(SIGHS) That's the stuff.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.578
Hey, do you know if I can drink this?

11:01.661 --> 11:05.586
Like, is it like well water, good for bathing,
but not so good for drinking?

11:05.707 --> 11:07.334
You know what? I'm going for it.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.711
(SLURPS AND WHEEZES)

11:10.295 --> 11:12.172
Yep, it tastes just like you'd think.
