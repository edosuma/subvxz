WEBVTT

00:09.364 --> 00:12.264
Oh, Angela Prescott
went all out again.

00:12.265 --> 00:14.766
It's the first public event
Angela's held all year.

00:14.835 --> 00:16.935
Wants to show off
the golden child.

00:17.003 --> 00:20.304
Sure his brothers are thrilled,
being upstaged by the war hero.

00:20.373 --> 00:21.806
Are they even here?

00:21.875 --> 00:24.108
I saw Caleb earlier
looking miserable.

00:24.177 --> 00:26.410
Oh, well, wouldn't you be
if your trust was frozen?

00:27.848 --> 00:29.447
You're such a gossip.

00:29.516 --> 00:30.748
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:30.817 --> 00:32.616
gather around.

00:34.553 --> 00:36.487
The Prescotts

00:36.555 --> 00:39.623
have been sponsoring this gala
for 20 years,

00:39.692 --> 00:41.125
and no one knows
more about giving

00:41.194 --> 00:43.260
than their youngest
son, Wyatt.

00:43.329 --> 00:45.162
And no one makes them prouder.

00:45.231 --> 00:47.098
So it only seems fitting

00:47.166 --> 00:49.633
that he present
this year's Prescott donation

00:49.702 --> 00:52.336
of $5 million.

00:52.405 --> 00:54.938
So with no further adieu,
please let me introduce

00:55.008 --> 00:57.074
Lieutenant Wyatt Prescott.

01:01.014 --> 01:04.080
Uh, Wyatt? That's your cue.

Hey. Brought out the big
guns for this one, huh?

01:43.945 --> 01:45.878
I got calls from bosses
I never even knew I had.

01:45.947 --> 01:48.348
Well, half the people in this
room have a direct line to D.C.

01:48.416 --> 01:49.515
Yeah. Victim?

01:49.584 --> 01:51.718
Navy Lieutenant Wyatt Prescott.

01:51.786 --> 01:53.386
Youngest son of <i>the</i> Prescotts.

01:53.455 --> 01:55.255
Prescotts as in
Prescott Playhouse?

01:55.323 --> 01:56.556
And medical school.

01:56.625 --> 01:58.324
Well, that'll complicate things.

01:58.393 --> 01:59.759
What do you know, Loretta?

01:59.827 --> 02:02.228
I know my entire house could fit
in this room.

02:02.296 --> 02:04.028
About Lieutenant Prescott.

02:04.097 --> 02:05.997
Broken neck
as far as I can tell.

02:06.066 --> 02:08.098
There's 21 steps
in the staircase.

02:08.168 --> 02:09.533
It's quite a fall.

02:09.603 --> 02:10.603
Did he fall?

02:10.638 --> 02:12.937
- Or was he pushed?
- I cannot tell yet.

02:13.006 --> 02:15.440
If it was an accident,
I may have the cause.

02:15.509 --> 02:18.042
These were hidden
in Lieutenant Prescott's room.

02:18.111 --> 02:19.745
That's a lot of pills.

02:19.813 --> 02:21.012
Yeah, and that's not all.

02:21.081 --> 02:24.249
May have been having
a private party.

02:24.318 --> 02:25.995
Ooh, well, depending
on what's in those pills,

02:26.019 --> 02:27.764
combined with alcohol,
that could send anyone

02:27.788 --> 02:29.220
tumbling down those stairs.

02:29.290 --> 02:31.501
Yeah, well, we'll know more
once I've run a full tox screen.

02:31.525 --> 02:32.805
According to the guests,

02:32.859 --> 02:34.170
there was an argument
that broke out

02:34.194 --> 02:36.027
right before the lieutenant
came tumbling.

02:36.096 --> 02:37.295
Any details?

02:37.363 --> 02:39.275
Tammy and Sebastian
are questioning the guests now.

02:39.299 --> 02:40.299
And the Prescott family?

02:40.366 --> 02:41.603
We're looking for them.

02:42.368 --> 02:44.135
What do you mean, "looking"?

02:44.204 --> 02:46.237
Well, it is a big house,
as Loretta said.

02:46.306 --> 02:49.107
The mother disappeared
as soon as NOPD arrived.

02:49.176 --> 02:50.641
Hasn't been seen since.

02:50.710 --> 02:52.277
Well, let's get on that.

02:52.345 --> 02:54.279
Got it.

02:55.348 --> 02:57.282
This is really too much.

02:57.350 --> 02:59.717
Do you think you could
get me a sparkling water?

02:59.786 --> 03:01.719
I wouldn't know.
I don't live here.

03:01.788 --> 03:03.299
You know what,
we'll ask one of the servers

03:03.323 --> 03:05.033
and see if maybe
they can bring you something.

03:05.057 --> 03:06.490
We will?

03:06.559 --> 03:08.726
Yeah. So, what happened earlier?

03:08.795 --> 03:11.395
Wyatt came tumbling
down the steps. End of story.

03:11.464 --> 03:12.596
Is that what you saw?

03:12.665 --> 03:13.831
Didn't see anything.

03:13.899 --> 03:15.265
We were too far
from the staircase.

03:15.335 --> 03:16.378
We miss all the good stuff.

03:16.402 --> 03:17.402
Oh.

03:17.470 --> 03:18.569
And to pay $2,000

03:18.638 --> 03:20.906
just to get in the room?
That seems unfair.

03:20.907 --> 03:23.941
Did you notice anything
off about Wyatt?

03:24.010 --> 03:25.509
He never joined the party.

03:25.578 --> 03:27.644
We only saw Caleb.
The rest of them were hidden out

03:27.713 --> 03:29.113
in the west wing
most of the night.

03:29.182 --> 03:31.682
But the Prescotts do have
addiction in the genes.

03:31.751 --> 03:33.448
From what you hear
or what you know?

03:33.472 --> 03:35.476
No.
Mark's just repeating rumors.

03:35.477 --> 03:36.477
Oh.

03:36.522 --> 03:37.522
Ask anyone.

03:37.555 --> 03:39.389
Well, no, I'm asking you.

03:39.457 --> 03:41.191
That's quite a tone
you're taking.

03:42.127 --> 03:43.226
Me? You want a tone?

03:43.295 --> 03:44.527
Uh, hey, you know,

03:44.596 --> 03:45.773
I was meaning
to ask you earlier.

03:45.797 --> 03:47.697
Is that a Cosmograph Daytona?

03:47.766 --> 03:48.999
It is.

03:49.067 --> 03:51.334
My father knows the North
American distributor.

03:51.403 --> 03:53.214
- Wow.
- We always get dibs on the best pieces.

03:53.238 --> 03:54.849
Yeah, you know what? My mother
knows Phil the butcher.

03:54.873 --> 03:56.172
We get dibs on the best chops.

03:56.241 --> 03:58.375
Let's get back to
what's happening.

03:58.443 --> 03:59.976
We've told you
everything we know.

04:00.045 --> 04:01.344
Now maybe you could point us

04:01.413 --> 04:02.757
in the direction
of something to eat?

04:02.781 --> 04:04.680
- What?
- Yeah. We're gonna go ahead

04:04.749 --> 04:06.895
and see if we can get that
taken care of for you, okay?

04:06.919 --> 04:08.385
Can I talk to you
for a quick moment?

04:08.453 --> 04:09.773
Just here in the
corner for a sec.

04:09.821 --> 04:10.986
Get in.

04:11.055 --> 04:12.354
What is your problem?

04:12.423 --> 04:13.633
- What?
- Where are your manners?

04:13.657 --> 04:15.024
<i>My</i> manners?
These rich people...

04:15.092 --> 04:16.524
Yeah. They're rich, okay?

04:16.593 --> 04:18.438
- They got to be handled.
- By kissing their asses?

04:18.462 --> 04:19.940
Which you did impressively,
by the way.

04:19.964 --> 04:21.430
Well, I'm fluent
in rich speak.

04:21.498 --> 04:22.597
Since when?

04:22.666 --> 04:24.233
Since boarding school.
I was, like,

04:24.302 --> 04:26.546
one of the only kids there
that wasn't from legacy wealth.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.703
Talking eight figures
in the bank,

04:28.772 --> 04:31.240
royalty in the bloodline.

04:31.309 --> 04:33.042
Like, Lafitte Club rich.

04:33.110 --> 04:35.044
What's the Lafitte Club?

04:35.112 --> 04:36.412
It's a private club.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.447
Generational families only.
It's super secret.

04:38.515 --> 04:40.082
It's super fancy.
That's... We just...

04:40.151 --> 04:42.084
we have to treat
these people differently.

04:42.153 --> 04:44.085
No, I'm a cop. I treat
everyone the same.

04:44.154 --> 04:46.220
And that's egalitarian,
and I love it.

04:46.289 --> 04:48.501
It's just not gonna get us the
information that we need, okay?

04:48.525 --> 04:49.758
We got to be smooth, you know.

04:49.827 --> 04:51.593
We got to be classy.
We got to be refined.

04:55.866 --> 04:58.433
Real refined.

04:58.502 --> 05:01.536
It's these flowers.
I got these allergies.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.583
All right, honey, let's get
you away from the plants

05:03.607 --> 05:06.074
before all your class comes
running out of your nose.

05:14.785 --> 05:16.817
Ms. Prescott?

05:16.886 --> 05:19.887
Special Agents Pride
and Khoury from NCIS.

05:19.956 --> 05:21.255
We'd like to
talk with you

05:21.324 --> 05:22.256
about your son.

05:22.325 --> 05:24.125
Absolutely, Special Agents.

05:24.194 --> 05:26.494
Let me offer my full assistance.

05:26.562 --> 05:29.930
I'm Lisa Butler.
Prescott family attorney.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.499
I'll answer any questions.

05:31.567 --> 05:33.607
Afraid we need to speak
with the Prescotts directly.

05:33.669 --> 05:35.481
I'm sure you understand
how distraught they are

05:35.505 --> 05:37.071
given this tragic accident.

05:37.140 --> 05:38.817
I'm sure you'll understand
that we have questions,

05:38.841 --> 05:41.509
given that we're not convinced
this was an accident.

05:49.652 --> 05:52.653
I know that you're
doing your job.

05:52.722 --> 05:54.655
And I'm doing mine.

05:54.724 --> 05:56.356
What exactly is your job?

05:56.425 --> 05:58.125
Protecting
the Prescott family interests.

05:58.193 --> 06:00.260
I've already put in a call
to the district attorney,

06:00.329 --> 06:02.763
who's a close, personal friend
of Ms. Prescott.

06:02.832 --> 06:04.698
Appreciate that,
but Wyatt was Navy.

06:04.767 --> 06:06.667
Makes this an NCIS case.

06:06.736 --> 06:08.468
Secretary of the Navy, then.

06:08.538 --> 06:09.658
I'm not sure he's available.

06:09.705 --> 06:12.472
He will be for Angela Prescott.

06:12.542 --> 06:14.608
Look, I don't mean
to be difficult,

06:14.677 --> 06:16.944
but these are very powerful,

06:17.013 --> 06:19.647
very private people,
and they can't just talk

06:19.715 --> 06:21.147
to anyone.
- Okay, well,

06:21.215 --> 06:22.693
I'm special agent in charge
of the Southeast region.

06:22.717 --> 06:24.183
Would that suffice?

06:24.252 --> 06:26.285
Maybe.

06:26.354 --> 06:27.987
If you do speak to them,

06:28.056 --> 06:30.890
they don't say a word
out of my presence.

06:33.028 --> 06:35.494
<i>Tell us what happened</i>
<i>earlier today.</i>

06:35.564 --> 06:36.963
What do you mean?

06:37.032 --> 06:39.331
Wyatt fell down the stairs.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.668
He's gone.

06:41.736 --> 06:43.302
Witnesses heard

06:43.371 --> 06:45.672
- Wyatt arguing before the fall.
- No one

06:45.740 --> 06:48.307
can positively state it was
Wyatt they heard. Not relevant.

06:49.578 --> 06:50.855
What was he doing
leading up to the party?

06:50.879 --> 06:52.879
Uh, he'd just come back
from overseas.

06:52.948 --> 06:54.424
He jumped right into
planning the gala,

06:54.448 --> 06:56.347
preparing his speech,
checking the menu.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.083
- Busy guy.
- Yeah.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.518
That was Wyatt.
Always working.

07:00.588 --> 07:01.811
Was he dealing
with any problems?

07:01.812 --> 07:04.690
Again,
not relevant to the accident.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.258
Wyatt never met a problem
he couldn't solve.

07:07.327 --> 07:09.561
That's what made him
who he was.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.630
Meaning?

07:13.667 --> 07:16.935
One summer,
the three of us boys,

07:17.004 --> 07:19.404
we built this boat from scratch.

07:19.473 --> 07:22.074
Bryce installed the prop,
but he was always lazy,

07:22.142 --> 07:23.709
and it was off-balance,

07:23.777 --> 07:25.789
and it kept going in circles,
throwing it off course.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.846
I think <i>we're</i> off course.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.881
We'd worked so hard,

07:30.950 --> 07:32.550
and Bryce screwed it up.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.352
He was always taking shortcuts.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.354
But Wyatt,

07:36.423 --> 07:39.591
the shrimp,
he was focused on the boat.

07:39.659 --> 07:42.193
He worked all night on that
prop until it was fixed.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.530
That was Wyatt.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.865
He balanced us.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.868
<i>I'm sure that Caleb told you</i>
<i>the boat story.</i>

07:50.937 --> 07:53.238
- It is one of his favorite pastimes.
- He did.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.706
But we are
interested in Wyatt.

07:55.775 --> 07:58.109
We found drugs and
alcohol in his room.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.812
Are you asking me
if he was using?

08:01.881 --> 08:02.429
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

08:02.430 --> 08:04.426
My-my little brother, he
was too pure for all that.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.450
You know,
"his body is a temple" BS.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.953
Oh, it's kind of
like you, Lisa.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.721
You make that sound like a flaw.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.723
Oh, no. Wyatt had no flaws.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.770
Well, everybody's got something
secret, skeleton in the closet.

08:14.794 --> 08:15.794
Bryce,

08:15.862 --> 08:17.072
you don't have to respond
to that.

08:17.096 --> 08:20.097
We're trying to find out
what led to Wyatt's death.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.565
A fall led to his death.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.101
There was an argument.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.602
Did somebody want
to hurt Wyatt?

08:25.672 --> 08:27.672
Hmm, only if you met him.
Bryce.

08:27.740 --> 08:29.073
Okay, look,

08:29.142 --> 08:31.776
the guy was my brother,
and he just died,

08:31.844 --> 08:34.443
but he was definitive.
- Definitive.

08:34.513 --> 08:36.011
Yeah.

08:36.081 --> 08:38.914
Like, everything was black
and white. There was no gray.

08:38.984 --> 08:41.350
So when I say that he had
no flaws, he was all too quick

08:41.419 --> 08:42.518
to point out yours.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.487
Well, that could rub
someone the wrong way.

08:44.556 --> 08:45.955
Yeah, you think?

08:48.026 --> 08:50.093
<i>Wyatt got along with everybody.</i>

08:50.162 --> 08:51.761
He made it
his mission in life.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.629
No enemies at all?

08:55.100 --> 08:56.833
He couldn't abide
anyone disliking him.

08:56.902 --> 08:58.968
Did Wyatt seem
distracted lately?

08:59.037 --> 09:02.038
Wyatt was on task.
My savior.

09:02.107 --> 09:04.040
I was distracted.

09:04.109 --> 09:06.776
By the gala, my business,
what I was going to wear.

09:06.845 --> 09:08.255
If I'd known what was
going to happen...

09:08.279 --> 09:09.712
If you'd known what?

09:09.780 --> 09:11.313
Ma'am,

09:11.381 --> 09:12.881
was there an issue
in Wyatt's life?

09:12.950 --> 09:14.717
We've already established
there wasn't.

09:14.785 --> 09:16.551
Ms. Prescott...

09:16.620 --> 09:18.653
we'd all like to believe
it was an accident,

09:18.723 --> 09:20.022
but under the
circumstances...

09:20.091 --> 09:21.990
The drugs, the alcohol,
the argument.

09:22.059 --> 09:25.060
We need to determine if Wyatt
was struggling with something.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.628
My skinny, bookish son

09:26.697 --> 09:28.964
managed to get an appointment
to Annapolis.

09:29.033 --> 09:30.833
Graduated at the
top of his class.

09:30.901 --> 09:32.567
He never struggled.
He simply performed.

09:32.636 --> 09:34.069
And now he's dead.

09:35.873 --> 09:37.806
You have what you need.

09:37.875 --> 09:40.308
And now the Prescott family
needs to grieve.

09:45.481 --> 09:47.348
We've questioned 200 guests,

09:47.416 --> 09:49.550
ten servers
and the entire staff.

09:49.619 --> 09:52.086
Couple of people say they heard
an argument before the fall.

09:52.155 --> 09:54.722
Yeah, but no one can determine
whose voices.

09:54.791 --> 09:56.190
Prescotts give you anything?

09:56.259 --> 09:58.592
Only that Wyatt was perfect
in every way.

09:58.661 --> 10:00.094
That's the most suspicious
of all.

10:00.163 --> 10:01.923
Which means we need to
question them further.

10:01.965 --> 10:03.231
Well, the lawyers won't let us

10:03.299 --> 10:04.643
until we have
some more specific questions.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.033
It's in Loretta's hands now.

10:06.102 --> 10:09.036
Once she completes her autopsy.

10:10.140 --> 10:11.839
Dr. Wade.

10:11.908 --> 10:13.707
- Dr. Huffman.
- Uh-uh.

10:13.777 --> 10:15.943
Gator.

10:16.012 --> 10:17.278
There you go.

10:17.346 --> 10:20.347
Why is the state coroner
in my morgue?

10:20.416 --> 10:23.517
And where is my body?

10:23.586 --> 10:24.918
Lieutenant Prescott

10:24.987 --> 10:26.420
has been removed
from your workload.

10:26.489 --> 10:27.921
No need to thank me.

10:27.990 --> 10:29.801
On the contrary.
What do you think you're doing?

10:29.825 --> 10:30.758
A favor, actually.

10:30.826 --> 10:32.225
Look, I know you see it

10:32.295 --> 10:34.261
as stepping on your toes,
but the Prescott autopsy

10:34.330 --> 10:36.096
is being handled by my office.

10:36.165 --> 10:37.931
Oh, I'm dying to hear
the explanation.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.634
This is about as high-profile
a case as they come.

10:40.703 --> 10:44.305
I am attuned to the delicate
nature of the circumstances.

10:44.373 --> 10:46.239
That was not an explanation.

10:46.309 --> 10:48.241
I was at my granddaughter's
dance recital

10:48.311 --> 10:50.143
when my phone started ringing.

10:50.212 --> 10:52.378
State superintendent, police.
Attorney general.

10:52.447 --> 10:53.646
The governor.

10:53.715 --> 10:55.615
You don't need that.

10:55.684 --> 10:58.985
Lieutenant Prescott's
death is an NCIS case.

10:59.054 --> 11:00.987
Lieutenant Prescott's death...

11:01.056 --> 11:02.655
is an accident.

11:03.792 --> 11:05.292
You can see
for yourself.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.805
Tox screen's preliminary.
It's incomplete.

11:06.829 --> 11:10.230
Your dedication is admirable,
but as I said before,

11:10.299 --> 11:13.800
Lieutenant Prescott's death
was an accident.

11:13.869 --> 11:16.769
Ten autopsies
won't change that.

11:16.839 --> 11:18.404
Now, excuse me.

11:24.179 --> 11:26.412
Just spoke to Loretta.

11:26.481 --> 11:27.613
Lieutenant Prescott

11:27.682 --> 11:30.483
has been taken
by the state coroner.

11:30.552 --> 11:32.284
Is that even legal?

11:32.354 --> 11:33.986
Not as far
as I'm concerned.

11:34.055 --> 11:36.789
But the body...
is out of our custody now.

11:36.858 --> 11:38.458
Well, we need to get him back.

11:38.526 --> 11:40.326
Have you spoken to
the state coroner?

11:40.395 --> 11:41.961
He's ducking my calls.

11:42.029 --> 11:43.674
He's not the only one
who's stonewalling us.

11:43.698 --> 11:44.938
Been reaching out to witnesses,

11:44.999 --> 11:46.532
trying to ask
follow-up questions.

11:46.601 --> 11:48.245
Everyone keeps referring me
to their lawyers now.

11:48.269 --> 11:50.470
If the Prescotts really believe
this was an accident,

11:50.538 --> 11:52.472
why are they trying
to cover it up?

11:52.540 --> 11:54.640
I don't love
the term "cover-up."

11:54.709 --> 11:56.809
Well, what would you call
having the state coroner

11:56.878 --> 11:58.978
Bigfoot our investigation?

11:59.046 --> 12:00.679
Expedience.

12:00.748 --> 12:03.147
We're getting
Lieutenant Prescott back.

12:03.216 --> 12:04.850
There's really no point.

12:04.918 --> 12:07.652
Wyatt is being cremated--
his mother's wishes.

12:07.721 --> 12:09.187
The case is closed.

12:09.256 --> 12:11.322
<i>We</i> determine
when the case is closed.

12:11.392 --> 12:12.524
You're obstructing justice.

12:12.593 --> 12:14.225
I understand your frustration.

12:14.294 --> 12:15.560
The Prescotts do, too.

12:15.629 --> 12:17.161
But there is a silver lining.

12:17.230 --> 12:19.731
Oh. Well,
what would that be?

12:19.800 --> 12:23.635
Angela and her sons
truly appreciate your...

12:23.704 --> 12:25.804
discretion and
professionalism

12:25.873 --> 12:27.639
during this
difficult time.

12:30.143 --> 12:31.743
Is this a service order?

12:31.812 --> 12:33.757
By the end of the week your
cables will be upgraded

12:33.781 --> 12:34.645
to, uh,

12:34.714 --> 12:36.013
- Cat 8.
- What?

12:36.081 --> 12:37.848
We've had this request
pending for months.

12:37.917 --> 12:40.651
- How did you do this?
- Completely above board.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.820
We made a few inquiries
on your behalf.

12:42.889 --> 12:46.724
If you have any other
problems or requests,

12:46.793 --> 12:48.025
give me a call.

12:48.093 --> 12:49.427
Already have your card.

12:49.495 --> 12:52.530
What you have is a friend
in Angela Prescott.

12:52.598 --> 12:54.665
That is a
valuable asset.

12:54.734 --> 12:57.000
Use it wisely.

12:58.671 --> 13:00.604
This isn't over.

13:02.274 --> 13:04.207
This is what rich people do.

13:04.276 --> 13:06.054
They sweep dirt under the rug,
and then they wave

13:06.078 --> 13:07.822
something shiny in your face,
hoping you forget about it.

13:07.846 --> 13:09.724
Are we just gonna let the
Prescotts get away with this?

13:09.748 --> 13:11.681
Not by a long shot.

13:19.346 --> 13:21.480
Hey. I talked to the
attorney general.

13:21.548 --> 13:24.182
U.S. attorney, too. We can
definitely take legal action

13:24.250 --> 13:26.117
to get Lieutenant
Prescott's body back,

13:26.186 --> 13:28.653
but... it'll be a process.
- Well, good. Let's get going.

13:28.722 --> 13:30.855
They also said,
off the record,

13:30.923 --> 13:33.257
the Prescotts will pull
any strings they can to stop us.

13:33.326 --> 13:34.925
They said it might be smarter

13:34.995 --> 13:36.760
to leave it alone.
Every move they make

13:36.829 --> 13:38.196
points to the lieutenant's death

13:38.264 --> 13:39.763
being more
than just an accident.

13:39.832 --> 13:41.265
I know, Gregorio,

13:41.334 --> 13:43.134
but we have to play
this one smart.

13:43.203 --> 13:45.669
The Prescotts are hiding
something from us.

13:45.738 --> 13:48.039
We're gonna find out what.
What are you thinking, Dwayne?

13:48.108 --> 13:50.341
We've been pushed away
from investigating

13:50.410 --> 13:52.143
Lieutenant Prescott's death...

13:52.212 --> 13:55.646
so we'll look into his life.

13:55.715 --> 13:57.982
Wyatt Prescott appears
as advertised.

13:58.051 --> 14:00.118
A squared-away Navy officer
with a perfect record.

14:00.186 --> 14:02.120
His digital life is
as squeaky clean

14:02.188 --> 14:03.454
as anything else about him.

14:03.523 --> 14:05.055
He doesn't do social media

14:05.124 --> 14:06.957
and he doesn't surf
questionable sites.

14:07.026 --> 14:08.692
What's his most
recent Navy post?

14:08.761 --> 14:10.528
Facilitating
port relations.

14:10.596 --> 14:13.998
A couple of months ago, he was
negotiating a lease in Brazil

14:14.066 --> 14:15.210
when he was in a car accident.

14:15.234 --> 14:16.634
Fractured
his collarbone.

14:16.702 --> 14:17.846
Could explain the pain pills.

14:17.870 --> 14:18.881
Then he came home to recover.

14:18.905 --> 14:20.470
He was back in New Orleans?

14:20.540 --> 14:21.750
That's when it gets interesting.

14:21.774 --> 14:23.614
While he was here,
he made multiple phone calls

14:23.643 --> 14:25.809
to CGIS Agent Michael Martin.

14:25.878 --> 14:27.845
Why was he talking
to the Coast Guard?

14:27.914 --> 14:30.047
They were investigating
Prescott Shipping.

14:31.283 --> 14:33.083
We don't have
any record of that.

14:33.152 --> 14:35.185
- What was he investigating?
- We're not sure.

14:35.254 --> 14:37.021
We reached out to CGIS,

14:37.089 --> 14:40.424
and they said the investigation
was closed, records sealed.

14:40.492 --> 14:42.192
You get ahold of
Special Agent Martin?

14:42.261 --> 14:43.760
You mean <i>former</i> special agent.

14:43.828 --> 14:45.028
Couple of days

14:45.097 --> 14:46.097
after talking to Wyatt,

14:46.131 --> 14:47.497
he was suspended without pay.

14:47.566 --> 14:49.266
Well, that may be
Prescott's doing.

14:49.334 --> 14:50.934
Any idea where Martin is?

14:51.002 --> 14:54.771
♪ Rolling and reeling ♪

14:54.839 --> 14:56.839
♪ Up the river ♪

14:56.908 --> 15:00.544
♪ To my queen ♪

15:00.612 --> 15:02.112
♪ And we rolling... ♪

15:02.181 --> 15:03.824
They called it
dereliction of duty.

15:03.848 --> 15:05.949
Said I came to work wasted.

15:06.017 --> 15:07.750
Lasalle, you know me, I'm a pro.

15:07.819 --> 15:08.952
Course you are.

15:09.020 --> 15:10.587
There must have
been a reason

15:10.655 --> 15:12.221
they came gunning
for you, though.

15:12.290 --> 15:13.856
Prescott Shipping,
for instance?

15:13.925 --> 15:15.625
Got nothing to say about that.

15:15.694 --> 15:17.627
And if you're smart,
neither do you.

15:17.696 --> 15:19.361
But you were
investigating them.

15:19.430 --> 15:23.232
Had several conversations
with Wyatt Prescott. Why?

15:23.301 --> 15:24.567
You want to know?

15:24.636 --> 15:26.235
Talk to him.

15:26.304 --> 15:28.537
Well, we would,
but... he's dead.

15:28.607 --> 15:29.939
Don't go sniffing.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.279
We need to know
what you found out

15:37.348 --> 15:39.248
about Prescott Shipping.

15:40.619 --> 15:42.251
I had no proof.

15:42.320 --> 15:43.586
Of what?

15:43.655 --> 15:44.954
Purgatory.

15:45.023 --> 15:47.789
The "lost and found"
of Port New Orleans.

15:47.858 --> 15:50.326
Container bar code doesn't scan,
it gets routed to purgatory

15:50.394 --> 15:51.793
until it's claimed.

15:51.862 --> 15:53.562
And Prescott Shipping?

15:53.631 --> 15:55.264
There was a pattern.

15:55.333 --> 15:59.401
Every month like clockwork,

15:59.470 --> 16:01.903
- You check it out?
- Of course.

16:01.972 --> 16:04.540
But when I got to the containers--
they were empty.

16:04.609 --> 16:05.974
Then what's the crime here?

16:06.043 --> 16:08.377
Purgatory containers
don't get weighed

16:08.446 --> 16:10.446
and don't go through customs.

16:10.515 --> 16:12.615
So if someone
was moving contraband...

16:12.683 --> 16:14.383
But to pull it off,
you need an inside man.

16:14.452 --> 16:16.585
But Wyatt didn't work
for the family business.

16:16.654 --> 16:18.420
No one else
would talk to me.

16:18.489 --> 16:20.623
Then I heard
Wyatt was back.

16:20.691 --> 16:22.724
I served in the
Navy ten years.

16:22.793 --> 16:24.826
Figured I'd reach out,
sailor to sailor.

16:24.895 --> 16:26.494
What'd he say?

16:26.563 --> 16:28.329
He was defensive,
of course.

16:28.398 --> 16:31.133
Said the family business
has always been above board.

16:31.201 --> 16:33.568
I asked him to
check it out anyway.

16:33.637 --> 16:36.237
36 hours later,
my case was closed,

16:36.306 --> 16:38.339
I was suspended.

16:38.408 --> 16:40.275
And now Wyatt's dead.

16:46.183 --> 16:47.348
There you are.

16:47.417 --> 16:49.151
Heard you had an
unwanted visitor.

16:49.219 --> 16:52.087
Gator Huffman is
a blowhard and a twit.

16:52.156 --> 16:55.022
If he thinks he can walk
into <i>my</i> morgue,

16:55.091 --> 16:56.957
do <i>my</i> autopsy,

16:57.026 --> 16:58.959
and rule <i>my</i> case
as an accident...

16:59.028 --> 17:00.995
He's got another
thing coming?

17:01.064 --> 17:03.363
I wasn't able
to complete the autopsy

17:03.432 --> 17:06.166
before Lieutenant Prescott
was taken away.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.868
However, I did keep
a sample of his blood.

17:08.938 --> 17:09.938
Loretta.

17:10.006 --> 17:11.305
Hey. Hey.

17:11.373 --> 17:13.307
We've been warned
off the case.

17:13.375 --> 17:14.875
When has that ever stopped us?

17:14.944 --> 17:16.844
Christopher and Gregorio
just spoke to a man

17:16.913 --> 17:18.444
whose career was ruined

17:18.513 --> 17:20.446
for poking the Prescotts
where he shouldn't.

17:20.516 --> 17:22.817
You're telling me that...

17:22.885 --> 17:25.685
Dwayne Pride is feeling gun-shy.

17:25.755 --> 17:28.722
I want us to all be
aware of the stakes.

17:28.790 --> 17:30.657
And yet, here we are...

17:30.726 --> 17:33.560
about to look
at the abnormalities

17:33.629 --> 17:36.663
in Lieutenant Prescott's
tox screen.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.132
You found something?

17:39.201 --> 17:41.635
Potent cocktail
of oxycodone

17:41.704 --> 17:43.537
and alprazolam.

17:43.606 --> 17:46.406
A mixture like that would
have made him delirious.

17:46.475 --> 17:48.208
Maybe he overindulged
at the gala.

17:48.277 --> 17:49.643
He wasn't the indulgent type.

17:49.712 --> 17:51.878
None of the drugs
found in his room

17:51.947 --> 17:53.213
were prescribed to him.

17:53.282 --> 17:54.881
And according
to Navy records,

17:54.950 --> 17:57.851
he refused pain medication
for a fractured collarbone!

17:57.919 --> 17:59.586
You're thinking
he was dosed?

17:59.622 --> 18:01.154
I <i>know</i> he was.

18:01.223 --> 18:04.323
Sebastian analyzed
the scotch glass from his room.

18:04.392 --> 18:06.826
We found traces
of the same drugs.

18:06.895 --> 18:08.161
Gator Huffman

18:08.230 --> 18:09.763
can call this an accident

18:09.831 --> 18:12.165
till he's blue in the face...

18:12.234 --> 18:15.235
but I have no doubt
we're looking at a murder.

18:17.438 --> 18:19.438
So, we've been looking
through Agent Martin's notes

18:19.474 --> 18:21.314
on the suspicious Prescott
shipping containers.

18:21.342 --> 18:23.462
Over the last two years,
dozens have gone to purgatory

18:23.511 --> 18:25.711
only to show back up
in the log as empty.

18:25.781 --> 18:27.546
Hmm. Any idea
what's in those containers?

18:27.615 --> 18:28.948
It's safe to say,
something bad.

18:29.017 --> 18:32.363
Yeah. What we do have, though,
is a partial list of container numbers.

18:32.364 --> 18:33.052
Whoever's responsible

18:33.121 --> 18:35.288
is lazy-- they've been
reusing the containers

18:35.356 --> 18:36.522
for this scam.
Hmm.

18:36.591 --> 18:39.224
Bar code numbers reused
over and over again.

18:39.294 --> 18:40.904
Yeah, and Lieutenant Prescott
knew it, too.

18:40.928 --> 18:43.562
Yeah, he visited purgatory
the day before he died.

18:43.631 --> 18:45.698
His I.D. was scanned at
the security entrance.

18:45.767 --> 18:47.566
Any idea
what he was doing there?

18:47.635 --> 18:51.370
Uh, he was checking out
container number VX729-33.

18:51.439 --> 18:53.124
It's been sitting there
dormant for days.

18:53.148 --> 18:54.604
We need to figure out
what's inside.

18:54.605 --> 18:56.325
That's gonna require
the Prescotts' consent.

18:57.345 --> 18:58.877
Yeah, well,
that's not gonna happen.

18:58.946 --> 19:00.813
Sebastian, go get Gregorio.
Get to purgatory.

19:00.881 --> 19:02.981
I want to know
who claims that container.

19:06.721 --> 19:08.153
This is giving me

19:08.222 --> 19:10.054
some very unpleasant
high school flashbacks.

19:10.123 --> 19:12.123
Last time
I was folded up like this,

19:12.192 --> 19:13.991
I was being stuffed
into a locker.

19:14.060 --> 19:15.740
Boarding school with
a bunch of rich kids--

19:15.796 --> 19:16.994
must have been
rough, right?

19:17.063 --> 19:18.396
Actually ended up okay.

19:18.465 --> 19:20.164
Kind of figured out
how to get along.

19:20.233 --> 19:22.266
- How's that?
- Self-deprecation.

19:22.336 --> 19:23.095
Oh.

19:23.119 --> 19:26.085
You make fun of yourself before
they can make fun of you. Boom.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.573
Plus, I was really good
with numbers, so I created

19:28.642 --> 19:30.363
an algorithm that could
predict the stock market.

19:30.387 --> 19:31.477
Really?

19:31.478 --> 19:33.144
Oh, I made a killing
for my classmates.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.479
Even got scouted
by Wall Street.

19:34.548 --> 19:37.449
Huh. You didn't want to be
master of the universe?

19:37.517 --> 19:40.585
Nah, I wanted to be master
of a science lab instead.

19:40.654 --> 19:42.520
If they could see
you now, huh?

19:42.589 --> 19:44.421
Well, I mean,
this isn't really one

19:44.490 --> 19:46.090
of my defining moments,
but yeah.

19:46.159 --> 19:48.425
I guess things are pretty good.

19:48.494 --> 19:51.028
You might get to unfold
yourself right now.

19:53.000 --> 19:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:01.707 --> 20:02.806
- Come on, come on.
- What?

20:02.876 --> 20:04.476
- All right, give me a second.
- Come on.

20:27.532 --> 20:28.731
Federal agents.

20:30.435 --> 20:31.435
Don't make a move.

20:34.106 --> 20:35.372
I got him.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.507
Turn around,
put your hands behind your back.

20:59.230 --> 21:01.564
She said not to move.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.100
What do we got?
Coke? Heroin?

21:07.004 --> 21:08.170
Cash.

21:08.239 --> 21:10.005
A lot of it.

21:19.386 --> 21:22.187
<i>Tammy and Sebastian found a</i>
<i>container of cash at the port.</i>

21:22.255 --> 21:24.622
All counterfeit,
according to the Secret Service.

21:24.691 --> 21:27.959
Well, ship came from Peru,
which is responsible

21:28.027 --> 21:30.328
for 60% of the
world's fake currency.

21:30.397 --> 21:31.696
Was Lieutenant Prescott
involved?

21:31.764 --> 21:33.431
Uh, suspects claim
they don't know.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.766
Once a month,
they pick up packages,

21:35.835 --> 21:38.203
drop them off at a warehouse
outside the city.

21:38.271 --> 21:39.704
Yeah, they're glorified
messengers.

21:39.772 --> 21:41.639
They're sent instructions
via anonymous e-mail,

21:41.708 --> 21:44.375
then paid through wire transfer
when the delivery is done.

21:44.444 --> 21:45.844
Okay, let's focus
on this warehouse.

21:45.912 --> 21:47.522
If Lieutenant Prescott
was smuggling cash,

21:47.546 --> 21:48.980
he had to pay it a visit.

21:49.048 --> 21:50.881
Hold on.
Right family, wrong son.

21:50.950 --> 21:51.987
Well, what do you mean?

21:52.016 --> 21:53.418
I've been scanning security video

21:53.419 --> 21:54.719
from around the warehouse.

21:55.316 --> 21:56.682
Found footage from two days ago.

21:57.352 --> 21:58.752
That's Lieutenant
Prescott.

21:58.820 --> 22:00.564
It looks like
he's trying to get in.

22:00.588 --> 22:01.621
But there's more.

22:01.689 --> 22:03.256
Who is that?

22:03.324 --> 22:04.858
Glad you asked.

22:07.695 --> 22:09.820
That's Bryce. That's one
of Lieutenant Prescott's brothers.

22:09.821 --> 22:11.854
Well, why would
a billionaire scion

22:11.923 --> 22:13.723
risk his family
shipping business

22:13.792 --> 22:15.558
to smuggle counterfeit cash?

22:15.626 --> 22:18.094
'Cause Bryce is not a
billionaire. His mother is.

22:18.163 --> 22:20.095
I looked into Bryce's finances.

22:20.164 --> 22:23.031
His condo, his car, all
his living expenses is paid for

22:23.100 --> 22:24.600
by Prescott Shipping.

22:24.669 --> 22:26.602
Wow. He only has
$100 in the bank?

22:26.671 --> 22:28.370
- He's broke.
- So he's been running

22:28.439 --> 22:30.306
fake papers
through the family business.

22:30.374 --> 22:32.708
His baby brother finds
out, confronts him.

22:32.776 --> 22:35.340
- Then what?
- We need to talk to Bryce again.

22:35.341 --> 22:37.261
Call the family lawyer.
Tell her to bring him in.

22:37.393 --> 22:39.376
I don't think
you're gonna get him.

22:39.444 --> 22:41.611
I've been tracing
Bryce's phone. It's pinging

22:41.680 --> 22:43.413
from a tower
by Lakefront Airport.

22:43.482 --> 22:46.149
I'll call Pride.

22:55.660 --> 22:56.893
Special Agent Pride.

22:56.961 --> 22:58.895
What are you doing here?

22:58.963 --> 23:00.963
Same as you.
Making contact with Bryce.

23:01.032 --> 23:03.900
Sadly, you are too late.

23:03.968 --> 23:05.902
He's just taken off.

23:07.005 --> 23:08.671
You let him
get on that plane?

23:08.740 --> 23:11.574
I told him to. He has urgent
business out of the country.

23:11.643 --> 23:13.777
And nothing to say to NCIS.

23:13.845 --> 23:16.178
I'll answer any
further questions.

23:16.247 --> 23:18.882
You can tell me why he was
smuggling counterfeit currency

23:18.950 --> 23:21.284
and what his involvement is
with his brother's murder.

23:21.352 --> 23:22.786
We've been through this.

23:22.854 --> 23:24.888
Lieutenant Prescott's
death was an accident,

23:24.956 --> 23:27.624
and the rest is a
misunderstanding.

23:27.692 --> 23:29.825
We both understand
perfectly well.

23:29.894 --> 23:33.328
Bryce is a murder suspect
and a fugitive now.

23:33.397 --> 23:35.898
That makes you
an accomplice.

23:37.034 --> 23:37.900
What are you doing?

23:37.968 --> 23:39.334
Arresting you

23:39.403 --> 23:40.736
for obstruction.

23:46.577 --> 23:48.544
There isn't a judge in the state

23:48.612 --> 23:50.646
that will let
this obstruction charge stick.

23:50.714 --> 23:52.748
You're wasting your time.

23:52.817 --> 23:54.983
No. You are,

23:55.052 --> 23:58.153
by protecting Bryce Prescott,

23:58.221 --> 24:00.021
who's smuggling
counterfeit cash...

24:00.090 --> 24:01.423
You can't prove that.

24:01.491 --> 24:03.390
...and running
from the murder investigation

24:03.460 --> 24:05.192
of his brother.
- Or that.

24:05.261 --> 24:08.362
We need Bryce
back in New Orleans

24:08.431 --> 24:10.698
immediately.

24:11.835 --> 24:13.200
Make a call.

24:13.269 --> 24:15.436
That's out of my control.

24:15.472 --> 24:17.338
Then I'll have you processed.

24:19.408 --> 24:22.242
You really want
to do this to yourself?

24:22.311 --> 24:24.779
Ruin your impressive career

24:24.848 --> 24:26.614
over misplaced suspicion?

24:26.683 --> 24:30.785
Huh. You're gonna do me like
CGIS Agent Michael Martin?

24:30.854 --> 24:32.386
The Prescotts
are like family to me.

24:32.455 --> 24:34.254
I do what I need to
to protect them.

24:34.323 --> 24:36.389
Protect <i>some</i> of 'em.

24:36.458 --> 24:38.859
You don't seem
to give a damn for Wyatt.

24:38.927 --> 24:40.393
How many times do I have
to say it?

24:40.462 --> 24:42.228
Wyatt's death was an accident.

24:42.297 --> 24:43.763
He had a potent cocktail

24:43.832 --> 24:45.899
of opioids and anxiety meds
in his system.

24:45.968 --> 24:47.968
Someone snuck it
into his drink.

24:48.036 --> 24:49.870
That is <i>not</i> an accident.

24:52.875 --> 24:55.609
This is a pointless exercise.

25:02.885 --> 25:05.619
You say the Prescotts
are like family.

25:05.687 --> 25:08.421
But they're not your family.

25:08.490 --> 25:10.990
End of the day,
they'll circle the wagons.

25:11.059 --> 25:13.226
You'll be on the outside.

25:14.662 --> 25:17.397
You've literally
just described my job.

25:19.167 --> 25:21.834
I am paid
to be outside the circle.

25:21.903 --> 25:24.837
And I am prepared
for what's next.

25:24.906 --> 25:27.006
Are you?

25:36.518 --> 25:38.542
Plane landed in
Havana 20 minutes ago.

25:38.543 --> 25:39.976
Local agents checked it out.

25:40.045 --> 25:42.311
Bryce's phone was
there, but Bryce wasn't.

25:42.380 --> 25:44.246
- This whole thing was a diversion.
- Maybe.

25:44.315 --> 25:46.493
But if Bryce hasn't left the
country, we don't have anything

25:46.517 --> 25:48.250
to hold her on.
Got to let her go.

25:48.319 --> 25:49.985
Yeah.

25:50.054 --> 25:52.388
Yeah, we do... eventually.

25:52.456 --> 25:53.406
You want to keep her here?

25:53.430 --> 25:55.249
I want to take our time
releasing her.

25:55.250 --> 25:57.216
If Butler's benched,
we got a shot

25:57.285 --> 26:00.586
at getting the Prescotts
to open up.

26:00.655 --> 26:03.189
<i>I hear</i>
<i>you've kidnapped my lawyer.</i>

26:03.258 --> 26:05.524
Provocative move, Special Agent.

26:05.593 --> 26:07.326
Well, gives us
an opportunity to talk.

26:07.395 --> 26:09.130
I have no interest in talking.

26:09.154 --> 26:10.321
But you have a deep interest

26:10.322 --> 26:12.656
in finding out
who murdered your son.

26:12.724 --> 26:14.090
No. This is not happening.

26:14.159 --> 26:15.888
You need to leave
our house at once.

26:15.912 --> 26:16.598
Caleb.

26:16.599 --> 26:18.031
We run a Fortune 500 company.

26:18.099 --> 26:19.659
- We have more than one lawyer.
- Caleb.

26:19.700 --> 26:21.500
- An army of them is on their way.
- Caleb.

26:21.569 --> 26:24.137
Caleb, shut up.

26:24.205 --> 26:28.041
Why would Bryce be
involved in Wyatt's death?

26:28.109 --> 26:30.810
It might have something to do
with a smuggling operation

26:30.878 --> 26:33.012
using Prescott Shipping
containers.

26:33.081 --> 26:35.648
How many accusations are you
going to throw at my family?

26:35.716 --> 26:37.483
We're not accusing
anyone of anything,

26:37.552 --> 26:39.252
but we do need clarity.

26:39.321 --> 26:42.989
Bryce and Wyatt had an argument
the day before Wyatt died.

26:43.058 --> 26:46.159
At a warehouse used to store
smuggled counterfeit currency.

26:46.227 --> 26:48.894
It was being leased
by a holding corporation

26:48.964 --> 26:50.363
that leads back to Bryce.

26:50.432 --> 26:53.599
Prescott Shipping has been
operating above board

26:53.668 --> 26:55.167
for over three generations.

26:55.235 --> 26:57.235
A legacy I preserve
above all else.

26:57.304 --> 27:00.238
No son of mine would
jeopardize that.

27:00.307 --> 27:02.207
You cut off your
sons' trusts?

27:02.276 --> 27:04.710
That is none of your concern.

27:04.779 --> 27:06.745
Maybe Bryce is being played.

27:06.814 --> 27:09.748
Maybe he's smuggling
the cash himself.

27:09.817 --> 27:12.551
Either way,
Wyatt discovered it.

27:12.620 --> 27:13.752
Now he's dead.

27:13.821 --> 27:15.888
I've heard you out.

27:15.957 --> 27:18.190
I have no idea
where Bryce is.

27:18.258 --> 27:20.793
And even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you.

27:22.296 --> 27:24.229
Caleb, show them the door.

27:27.834 --> 27:30.535
Do you have evidence
of any of this?

27:32.973 --> 27:34.906
If you want to see it,

27:34.975 --> 27:36.475
bring Bryce to NCIS.

27:36.543 --> 27:39.044
We'll show you everything.

27:43.317 --> 27:45.417
All right, let's hope
he takes the bait.

27:48.022 --> 27:50.122
All right,
we got eyes on Caleb.

27:50.190 --> 27:51.923
- He's on the move.
- Keep close.

27:51.992 --> 27:54.226
My guess is, he's gonna lead us
straight to his brother.

27:54.294 --> 27:56.161
You got it, boss.
Patton gave us access

27:56.230 --> 27:57.996
to Caleb's phone,
so, we'll be listening.

28:10.010 --> 28:11.943
Hello?
Bryce, it's me.

28:12.012 --> 28:13.578
Yeah, where are you?

28:13.647 --> 28:15.179
Downstairs in my car.

28:15.248 --> 28:16.814
You come alone?

28:16.883 --> 28:19.116
Yeah, but you got
to get out here now.

28:19.185 --> 28:21.352
NCIS knows you're still in town.

28:21.421 --> 28:22.820
We need to move.

28:22.889 --> 28:25.423
- Yeah, okay. Be right there.
- Pride was right.

28:25.491 --> 28:27.525
Seems like Caleb knows
<i>exactly</i> what was going on.

28:27.594 --> 28:29.774
Yeah, the minute we see Bryce,
we take them both down.

28:29.798 --> 28:31.798
You got it.

28:38.437 --> 28:39.770
- Let's go get 'em.
- All right.

28:50.182 --> 28:52.382
What the hell?!

29:01.293 --> 29:03.493
Stay back!
Stay back!

29:03.562 --> 29:05.862
Federal agents.

29:09.101 --> 29:11.234
He's dead.

29:18.981 --> 29:21.949
Caleb Prescott hit his
Global brother Bryce with a car,

29:22.018 --> 29:23.918
killing him instantly.

29:23.986 --> 29:26.720
Just one day after their younger
brother Wyatt died suspiciously.

29:26.789 --> 29:28.020
And after Wyatt discovered

29:28.021 --> 29:29.487
a counterfeit
smuggling operation

29:29.555 --> 29:31.088
hidden in the family business.

29:31.157 --> 29:34.758
Did Caleb kill Bryce
for revenge over Wyatt's death,

29:34.827 --> 29:37.161
or to cover up his own
involvement in this mess?

29:37.230 --> 29:38.762
Well, only one
way to find out.

29:38.831 --> 29:40.431
We need Caleb.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.066
He disappeared after
the hit-and-run.

29:42.135 --> 29:43.600
Abandoned his car
a few blocks away.

29:43.669 --> 29:45.569
We put a BOLO out, and
Lasalle's with the NOPD

29:45.638 --> 29:47.137
right now on a manhunt,

29:47.205 --> 29:49.017
but he can't get that far.
Yeah, unless it's his turn

29:49.041 --> 29:50.519
to jump on a plane
and flee the country.

29:50.543 --> 29:52.142
So then let's talk
to the family lawyer.

29:52.210 --> 29:53.944
No, we let her go
a couple hours ago.

29:54.013 --> 29:55.579
She's not gonna be
in a giving mood.

29:55.648 --> 29:57.088
And I wouldn't expect
Angela Prescott

29:57.149 --> 29:58.481
to be very cooperative.

29:58.551 --> 30:00.017
Two sons dead,
and one on the run.

30:00.085 --> 30:01.618
Well, we don't think
he's on the run.

30:01.687 --> 30:04.955
I ran a trace on Caleb's
cell phone and credit card.

30:05.024 --> 30:06.690
No call or charges.

30:06.759 --> 30:09.593
He's gonna want to escape.
He's gonna need help doing it.

30:09.662 --> 30:11.072
Well, I think that he went
to the one place

30:11.096 --> 30:12.796
where he knows that he can go.

30:12.865 --> 30:14.643
Do you remember that plaque that
we saw at the Prescotts' house?

30:14.667 --> 30:16.144
- The pirate thing?
- Yeah, the Lafitte Club.

30:16.168 --> 30:17.200
What's the Lafitte Club?

30:17.269 --> 30:18.634
Very old, very exclusive.

30:18.703 --> 30:20.469
- Prescotts are members?
- And...

30:20.538 --> 30:23.138
the club is only a few blocks
away from where Caleb hit Bryce.

30:23.207 --> 30:25.107
Great job, Sebastian.
Let's go find him.

30:41.292 --> 30:44.493
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Step outside, please.

30:47.065 --> 30:49.131
I thought I'd have more time.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.300
The wine hasn't even
opened up yet.

30:51.368 --> 30:53.301
Life's full of
disappointments.

30:53.369 --> 30:55.336
- Is he dead?
- Yes.

30:55.405 --> 30:57.005
I did that.

30:57.074 --> 30:58.406
We know.

30:58.475 --> 30:59.975
We're wondering why.

31:00.043 --> 31:01.743
Caleb, don't say another word.

31:01.812 --> 31:04.012
Ms. Butler.
You got here fast.

31:04.081 --> 31:05.758
We can talk about
the seven different reasons

31:05.782 --> 31:07.181
why I'm suing you in a minute,

31:07.250 --> 31:08.695
but right now,
Caleb is requesting counsel.

31:08.719 --> 31:10.919
- No, I'm not.
- Caleb, please be quiet.

31:10.988 --> 31:12.553
I'm done being quiet.

31:12.623 --> 31:14.723
Following the rules,
making Mom happy.

31:14.791 --> 31:16.324
I need to talk.

31:16.392 --> 31:18.593
You'll get your head straight
and listen to me.

31:18.662 --> 31:20.595
I can't do it anymore.

31:22.099 --> 31:24.032
I killed Bryce because...

31:24.101 --> 31:26.101
he killed Wyatt.

31:27.402 --> 31:29.202
None of this is admissible.

31:29.271 --> 31:30.604
Caleb,

31:30.673 --> 31:32.039
are you aware of your rights?

31:32.108 --> 31:33.907
I know that I can have a lawyer

31:33.976 --> 31:35.575
if I want to, but I don't.

31:35.645 --> 31:37.344
Bryce cheated.

31:37.412 --> 31:39.947
His whole life,
he cheated on girlfriends,

31:40.016 --> 31:41.882
he cheated on tests,
his-his family.

31:41.951 --> 31:43.784
He didn't care
if he destroyed the company

31:43.853 --> 31:45.919
as long as he got
a little pocket money.

31:45.988 --> 31:47.921
He was running
the smuggling operation?

31:47.990 --> 31:50.124
Yes. And Wyatt confronted him.

31:50.192 --> 31:53.027
Bryce tried to cover it up

31:53.095 --> 31:58.598
by killing the one
good person in this family.

32:02.204 --> 32:04.437
We're gonna take
you back to NCIS.

32:04.506 --> 32:06.273
You can write
it all down.

32:06.341 --> 32:08.241
Whatever you say.

32:08.310 --> 32:12.745
Caleb, murder has
a life sentence.

32:12.814 --> 32:15.382
If you do not stop,
you will die in prison.

32:15.450 --> 32:17.150
Does it matter?

32:28.797 --> 32:30.664
Caleb Prescott confessed?

32:30.732 --> 32:32.332
Yeah. Gave us everything.

32:32.741 --> 32:34.718
Proof Bryce was moving
counterfeit currency,

32:34.719 --> 32:35.949
and that Wyatt found out.

32:35.950 --> 32:37.449
Pride's wrapping up
the interview now.

32:37.519 --> 32:40.920
One brother kills the other
to keep his secrets.

32:40.989 --> 32:43.489
And then the third brother
kills him for revenge.

32:43.558 --> 32:45.257
Really tragic.

32:45.326 --> 32:46.893
Turn it over
to the D.A.

32:46.961 --> 32:48.327
and they'll take
it from here.

32:48.520 --> 32:50.111
We got a problem.

32:50.112 --> 32:51.734
The evidence doesn't match
the confession.

32:51.735 --> 32:52.500
What?

32:52.524 --> 32:53.901
So there were
flowers everywhere

32:53.902 --> 32:56.002
at the Prescott gala
the day that Wyatt died.

32:56.070 --> 32:58.616
- I had an allergic reaction.
- Yeah, he was sneezing like crazy.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.450
- His nose was running all over the place.
- That's not the point.

33:00.474 --> 33:02.642
- I'm just saying. It was a mess.
- We don't have to...

33:03.503 --> 33:05.366
The point is that
it wasn't the flowers

33:05.367 --> 33:06.912
that caused the reaction,
it was the mold spores

33:06.936 --> 33:08.601
that the flowers were carrying.

33:08.670 --> 33:10.822
Okay. You're allergic
to mold. So?

33:10.823 --> 33:13.019
Well, even if you're not
allergic, those spores,

33:13.020 --> 33:14.164
they attach themselves
to your lungs

33:14.188 --> 33:16.255
and your nasal passages.
- And it stays for days.

33:16.324 --> 33:18.724
Yeah. And Wade just finished
Bryce's autopsy...

33:18.792 --> 33:20.159
no sign of any spores.

33:20.228 --> 33:21.494
How is that possible?

33:21.562 --> 33:22.939
Because Bryce didn't
join the party.

33:22.963 --> 33:24.330
Yeah, he stuck to
the west wing

33:24.398 --> 33:25.476
where there
were no flowers.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.832
Bryce didn't kill Wyatt.

33:26.900 --> 33:28.601
And Caleb killed Bryce
for no reason.

33:28.669 --> 33:30.569
We're back to square one.

33:30.638 --> 33:32.238
We need to tell Pride
and figure out

33:32.306 --> 33:33.705
who had a motive to kill Wyatt.

33:33.774 --> 33:35.174
<i>I think I got an answer.</i>

33:35.243 --> 33:37.543
When I was looking into
the smuggling operation,

33:37.612 --> 33:39.156
I got very familiar
with Prescott Shipping.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.513
What'd you find, P?

33:40.581 --> 33:42.714
A company that's in turmoil.

33:42.783 --> 33:44.549
Repair work pending on ships,

33:44.618 --> 33:47.118
upper management leaving
and not being replaced...

33:47.187 --> 33:48.586
lots of unpaid bills.

33:48.655 --> 33:50.688
Reminds me of my father's
company at the end.

33:50.757 --> 33:52.524
- Are you thinking bankruptcy?
- Could be.

33:52.592 --> 33:54.559
Might explain
why Angela Prescott

33:54.628 --> 33:57.028
has been taking regular trips
to Houston the last few months.

33:57.096 --> 33:58.796
What's in Houston?

33:58.865 --> 34:00.632
Allied Freight.

34:00.700 --> 34:02.345
That's the Prescotts'
number one competitor.

34:02.369 --> 34:04.235
I think we're looking at
a corporate merger.

34:04.304 --> 34:06.237
I'm not seeing
the motive for murder.

34:06.306 --> 34:08.906
Well, I might see one.

34:08.975 --> 34:11.309
Allied Freight holds
hundreds of millions

34:11.378 --> 34:13.077
in military contracts.

34:13.146 --> 34:15.257
A lot of government
scrutiny on business practices.

34:15.282 --> 34:18.126
If it was revealed that the Prescotts
were running a smuggling operation...

34:18.150 --> 34:19.616
Bye-bye, merger.

34:19.685 --> 34:22.152
Prescott Shipping is
a publicly traded company,

34:22.221 --> 34:23.887
lot of shareholders
have a stake.

34:23.955 --> 34:25.822
Yeah. For the merger
to be successful,

34:25.891 --> 34:28.592
the smuggling operation
has to disappear.

34:28.661 --> 34:32.496
There's one person in
the Prescott organization

34:32.565 --> 34:34.898
who handles the dirty work.

34:41.072 --> 34:43.473
Ms. Butler.

34:43.542 --> 34:45.775
Thanks for meeting me.

34:45.844 --> 34:47.643
Can I buy you a drink?

34:47.713 --> 34:50.414
It's not gonna stop me from
suing you for unlawful arrest.

34:52.217 --> 34:54.350
No strings attached.

34:56.888 --> 34:58.321
You have a dry
Sauvignon Blanc?

34:58.389 --> 35:01.524
I've got cold white wine.

35:04.996 --> 35:07.496
So what do you want?

35:07.565 --> 35:10.299
A conversation.

35:10.368 --> 35:12.235
No badges.
No law degrees.

35:12.303 --> 35:14.838
Just two people talking.

35:14.906 --> 35:17.173
I don't know what
there is to say.

35:17.242 --> 35:19.508
You've already ruined the
life of one of my clients.

35:19.577 --> 35:21.077
Caleb ruined his own life.

35:21.146 --> 35:22.812
And for no good reason.

35:22.881 --> 35:25.715
Bryce didn't kill Wyatt.

35:25.784 --> 35:28.483
I've been telling you that.

35:28.552 --> 35:30.052
Kristen Jones did.

35:31.956 --> 35:33.521
I'm not familiar
with that name.

35:33.590 --> 35:34.823
You should be.

35:34.892 --> 35:36.691
It's a pseudonym.

35:36.761 --> 35:41.529
Used to acquire prescriptions
for alprazolam and oxycodone.

35:41.598 --> 35:44.099
Both found in Wyatt's
bloodstream.

35:44.168 --> 35:45.700
And we've spoken
to the doctor

35:45.770 --> 35:49.004
and he told us that
Kristen Jones is you.

35:49.073 --> 35:52.574
It's not an uncommon practice
for high-profile individuals

35:52.643 --> 35:56.711
to use an alias
when procuring medications.

35:56.781 --> 35:59.547
That's not an admission,
by the way.

35:59.616 --> 36:02.449
Bryce said you
were like Wyatt.

36:02.518 --> 36:03.918
You didn't take pills.

36:05.855 --> 36:07.889
The drugs weren't for you.

36:07.957 --> 36:10.124
They were for Angela Prescott.

36:10.193 --> 36:12.193
You know I won't say either way.

36:12.262 --> 36:15.529
Yes. Because you're guarding
the Prescott family.

36:15.598 --> 36:18.732
Covering up anything that could
derail the company's merger.

36:18.802 --> 36:21.903
I'm sorry. Are you suggesting
that I killed Wyatt?

36:21.971 --> 36:23.805
I'm suggesting that
Angela Prescott did.

36:23.873 --> 36:25.239
And I think you
believe it, too.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.408
Impossible.

36:27.476 --> 36:29.476
The woman you work for

36:29.545 --> 36:31.913
single-handedly runs
the business.

36:31.981 --> 36:36.449
Her sole concern is preserving
its legacy. Her words.

36:36.518 --> 36:40.120
What wouldn't she do
to save it from scandal?

36:40.155 --> 36:42.655
She wouldn't murder
her own child.

36:42.724 --> 36:45.091
Not on purpose.

36:45.160 --> 36:48.161
Maybe... maybe by accident.

36:48.230 --> 36:52.065
It's all conjecture and theory.

36:52.134 --> 36:56.269
Yes, which is why I need
your help to prove it.

36:56.338 --> 36:59.739
And why would I do that?

36:59.808 --> 37:05.145
Your job was to protect the
Prescotts and you failed.

37:05.214 --> 37:07.280
Two sons are dead.

37:07.349 --> 37:09.248
One is going
to prison for life.

37:10.684 --> 37:12.852
I wouldn't be able
to live with that.

37:15.022 --> 37:17.289
Can you?

37:28.707 --> 37:31.207
Ms. Prescott.

37:31.276 --> 37:33.810
You need to come with us.

37:33.879 --> 37:37.280
I can't believe you're doing
this to me again.

37:37.349 --> 37:39.483
I need to make arrangements
for a second funeral here.

37:39.551 --> 37:42.050
And you have our sympathies,
but it'll have to wait.

37:42.119 --> 37:44.787
Lisa, deal with this.

37:44.856 --> 37:47.823
Just go with them, Angela.

37:47.892 --> 37:50.125
I'll be there, too,
and we can sort this out.

37:52.697 --> 37:54.663
What exactly are we sorting?

37:54.732 --> 37:57.800
The fact that you drugged
Wyatt the other night.

37:57.869 --> 37:59.434
And it led to his death.

37:59.504 --> 38:02.070
That is absolutely not true.

38:02.139 --> 38:03.973
I told them I gave you
the medications.

38:04.041 --> 38:06.642
Same ones that ended up
in Wyatt's bloodstream.

38:06.711 --> 38:08.511
How could you?

38:08.579 --> 38:11.346
I also told them I don't think
you meant to hurt him.

38:11.415 --> 38:13.482
You can't say that.

38:13.551 --> 38:15.917
Crime-fraud exception.

38:15.986 --> 38:17.652
Attorney-client privilege

38:17.721 --> 38:19.621
doesn't apply to covering up
a murder.

38:19.689 --> 38:23.357
You used me, Angela.

38:23.426 --> 38:25.627
Wyatt confronted you about
the smuggling operation

38:25.695 --> 38:27.194
Bryce was running, didn't he?

38:27.263 --> 38:28.763
Threatened to expose you.

38:28.832 --> 38:31.332
Which would kill the merger
and ruin your company.

38:31.401 --> 38:33.768
I won't stand
for these accusations.

38:38.207 --> 38:40.107
He was my son.

38:41.678 --> 38:43.310
The best of the three.

38:43.379 --> 38:45.046
I know, Angela.

38:45.114 --> 38:48.516
I know how much
he meant to you.

38:48.584 --> 38:50.617
He wanted to go
to the authorities.

38:50.686 --> 38:52.619
I promised to stop Bryce.

38:52.688 --> 38:54.555
Promised to shut it all down.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.490
All he needed to do
was stay quiet.

38:56.559 --> 38:57.891
But he wouldn't.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.326
He refused to lie.

38:59.395 --> 39:01.062
Even for me.

39:01.130 --> 39:02.563
Even for one night.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.498
You wanted to slow him down.

39:04.567 --> 39:06.967
Talk some sense into him.

39:07.036 --> 39:08.635
That's why you used the drugs.

39:08.704 --> 39:11.705
I needed time to think...

39:11.774 --> 39:14.208
to change his mind.

39:15.778 --> 39:17.511
It was an accident.

39:17.580 --> 39:19.046
We argued.

39:19.115 --> 39:22.816
He got up to leave
and then he tripped, and...

39:22.885 --> 39:25.351
I couldn't get to him
before he fell.

39:25.420 --> 39:27.721
Oh, Angela.

39:27.790 --> 39:30.691
He was the one
who held us together.

39:32.494 --> 39:35.028
He was the one
that this was all for.

39:37.733 --> 39:41.034
And now he's gone.

39:41.103 --> 39:43.503
They're all gone.

39:43.572 --> 39:46.840
It's okay.

39:49.578 --> 39:52.178
Give us a minute.

39:52.247 --> 39:54.114
She'll come willingly.

40:03.625 --> 40:06.926
Not too often another family
makes mine look normal.

40:06.995 --> 40:08.794
I've never seen
a-a powerful family

40:08.863 --> 40:10.263
implode up close before.

40:10.332 --> 40:11.842
It was kind of like
witnessing the big bang.

40:11.866 --> 40:14.100
The good news
is CGIS Agent Martin

40:14.169 --> 40:15.935
is being reinstated.

40:16.004 --> 40:17.648
And we shut down the biggest
counterfeit operation

40:17.672 --> 40:18.804
in the Southeast.

40:18.873 --> 40:20.373
Plus, I had it at 50/50 odds

40:20.442 --> 40:21.986
we'd even have jobs
by the end of this case.

40:22.010 --> 40:23.543
So I'm feeling pretty pumped.

40:23.612 --> 40:27.313
Well, that was the last bit
of paperwork for me.

40:27.382 --> 40:28.981
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

40:29.050 --> 40:30.316
- Night.
- Bye.

40:30.385 --> 40:31.917
All right,
take care.

40:34.055 --> 40:36.989
So, uh, this stock thing
of yours. The algorithm.

40:37.058 --> 40:39.959
I was wondering how long it was
gonna take you to bring this up.

40:40.028 --> 40:42.294
No. Uh-- I'm curious.

40:42.363 --> 40:43.929
This is a <i>Beautiful Mind</i>
situation.

40:43.998 --> 40:45.809
Why wouldn't you use it
to make some real money?

40:45.833 --> 40:49.568
Have I ever told you about my
Uncle Jerry up in Illinois?

40:49.637 --> 40:50.670
I don't think so.

40:50.738 --> 40:52.571
Okay, so he runs
a fishing charter.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.640
All right? It's
just him, one boat.

40:54.709 --> 40:56.408
Out on Lake Michigan.

40:56.477 --> 40:58.644
And one time I bring up a
buddy of mine from school,

40:58.713 --> 41:00.012
just to go check it out,

41:00.081 --> 41:01.580
this hotshot venture
capitalist guy.

41:01.649 --> 41:04.183
One of your bros from
the boarding school days?

41:04.251 --> 41:07.752
Exactly. So, my buddy, he
has this amazing time, okay?

41:07.821 --> 41:09.899
All the worries of the world,
they just, they disappear

41:09.923 --> 41:13.192
while we're on this, like,
five-hour fishing trip.

41:13.260 --> 41:15.694
So now he wants to invest
in my uncle's charter.

41:15.762 --> 41:17.596
Mm. I like where
this story is going.

41:17.665 --> 41:21.032
Yeah. He offers him a million
dollars right then and there.

41:21.101 --> 41:22.201
My uncle turns him down.

41:22.269 --> 41:23.635
What? Why?

41:23.704 --> 41:25.704
Because he already has
everything that he wants.

41:25.772 --> 41:28.307
He's got his boat, he's got his
business, he's got the lake.

41:28.375 --> 41:30.642
I mean, why ruin something
that's already perfect

41:30.711 --> 41:32.043
just for more money?

41:32.112 --> 41:33.712
Because it's a million dollars.

41:33.780 --> 41:35.880
Yeah, but he didn't need
a million dollars.

41:35.949 --> 41:37.949
Just like he didn't need
a bigger business.

41:38.018 --> 41:39.658
You know, he was already
living his dream.

41:42.288 --> 41:46.691
I get to work every day
at a job that I love

41:46.760 --> 41:48.492
with people that I love.

41:50.530 --> 41:53.231
In my book,
that makes me pretty rich.

41:53.299 --> 41:55.800
That's a beautiful sentiment.

41:55.869 --> 41:58.669
Stupid, but beautiful.
