WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.436
Hey, Mom. So, um,
I know I told you that

00:02.503 --> 00:04.272
my guest list for the wedding
was locked,

00:04.338 --> 00:06.640
but I have
a couple more names.
How many more?

00:06.707 --> 00:08.442
No, just...17.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.777
What?

00:09.843 --> 00:11.612
Honey, no. No, no, no.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.447
The reception hall
is only so big,

00:13.514 --> 00:15.516
and some
of your dad's friends,

00:15.583 --> 00:17.851
they -- they take up
a lot of space.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.455
A lot of space.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.492
Sara.
What? I'm agreeing with you.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.360
Okay, well, I have to
invite Enzo.
( Scoffs )

00:26.427 --> 00:27.795
I mean, he's my boss.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.563
And he's already asking me,
"Hey, kid. Where's my invite?

00:29.630 --> 00:31.332
I already rented the shoes."

00:31.399 --> 00:34.135
I mean, do we really need --
what? Like, the Hendersons?

00:34.202 --> 00:35.803
Well, you know, maybe we don't

00:35.869 --> 00:38.472
since Sara called
their baby ugly.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.641
They probably won't want
to come anyway, so no.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.111
Crossin' them off.
Ooh, that feels good.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.778
You're welcome.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.115
But still, we have
way too many guests,

00:47.181 --> 00:48.449
and we are way over budgets.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.983
Okay, well, Mom, if it helps,

00:50.050 --> 00:51.485
I can pick up
extra shifts at work.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.887
No, honey, you're already
working almost
every single day.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.556
Your dad took a job
with Rootger

00:55.623 --> 00:57.158
down at the warehouse
at Best Box.

00:57.225 --> 01:01.395
And Chale is...
cheering us on.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.964
Oh, hey. Uh, coffee
and an egg sandwich for you.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.766
Yeah, what is, uh,
what is this?

01:05.833 --> 01:07.268
One of the eggs looked
a little funky.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.303
So, you know, just in case.
Oh.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.405
I don't need it.
Uh, this area,
it can take a punch,

01:11.472 --> 01:13.141
you know what I'm sayin'?

01:13.207 --> 01:14.875
All right, so which part
of the wedding

01:14.942 --> 01:16.310
am I working for today?
All right,

01:16.377 --> 01:19.313
so if you put in eight hours,
you can pay for...

01:19.380 --> 01:21.782
one slice of cake.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.985
How much is this cake?
Let me see that.

01:25.052 --> 01:26.987
N-no. That's it.
We're going with Yodels.

01:27.054 --> 01:30.258
Every table gets a Yodel.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.992
( Horn honks )
All right, that's Rootger.
I gotta go.

01:32.059 --> 01:34.061
Oh, by the way, uh,
I invited him to the wedding.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.263
Rootger's coming?

01:35.329 --> 01:36.630
Yes, and he's bringing
his girlfriend.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.932
Her name is, uh, Floor.
That's right.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.268
( Deep voice )
Rootger and Floor,

01:40.334 --> 01:41.469
come forth
to the dance floor.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.204
Mm. Mm.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.672
Yo?

01:44.738 --> 01:46.474
Mr. Gable, are there any
job openings

01:46.540 --> 01:47.975
down at the warehouse?

01:48.041 --> 01:49.743
-For you?
-Yes.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.445
I'm just -- You realize
it's a warehouse?

01:51.512 --> 01:54.348
It's where boxes are lifted
and moved around and stuff.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.917
And it's just -- It's not
the greatest gig for people

01:56.984 --> 01:59.320
with bird bones.

01:59.387 --> 02:02.190
I'm a lot stronger than
you think, Mr. Gable.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.924
All right, you know what?
I will see if they're hiring.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.493
-Okay?
-Thank you, sir.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.461
All right, are you squeezing
my hand to prove

02:07.528 --> 02:08.696
how strong you are?

02:08.762 --> 02:10.864
-( Strained ) No!
-Okay.

02:10.931 --> 02:15.403
* I am not your ordinary guy

02:16.537 --> 02:18.772
( Engine rumbling
in distance )

02:20.974 --> 02:23.711
Come on, guy. You're sweating
all over the boxes.

02:23.777 --> 02:26.347
Makes it hard to read
the barcodes.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.182
It's crazy hot back here, man.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.783
Where's the air conditioning?

02:29.850 --> 02:33.187
Oh, that?
That's, uh, in the spa area.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.122
Right next to the waterfall.

02:35.189 --> 02:36.790
It's a warehouse, guy.

02:36.857 --> 02:40.261
( Reverse alert beeping )

02:40.328 --> 02:42.095
Hey, uh, I noticed you're out

02:42.162 --> 02:43.797
of the, uh, the Bluetooth
headphones thing.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.233
I'm gonna go up front
and let them know that...

02:45.299 --> 02:46.900
-Ah, don't do it.
-What?

02:46.967 --> 02:48.802
Come on, you're looking for
an excuse to go up front

02:48.869 --> 02:50.504
into the air conditioning.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.872
What?

02:51.939 --> 02:53.874
Yeah. Trust me,
it'll kiss your skin,

02:53.941 --> 02:55.243
you're gonna love it,

02:55.309 --> 02:57.878
and then you're gonna have to
come back here and melt.

02:57.945 --> 03:01.782
Like a plastic bag against
the side of a toaster.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.385
It's not about
the air conditioning.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.588
( Exhales )

03:14.027 --> 03:15.229
( Exhales )

03:15.296 --> 03:16.797
Gable.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.432
Hey, Mark.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.068
Uh, just wanted to come up
and report that we are, uh,

03:21.134 --> 03:22.536
we're out of
the Bluetooth headphones.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.771
Okay. Got it. Thanks.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.939
Yeah, it's a popular item
back there.

03:26.006 --> 03:29.343
People -- they don't like
their wires, you know?

03:29.410 --> 03:31.512
They say in the future,
no wires, you know?

03:31.579 --> 03:34.014
That's really
what we sell here
is the future.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.148
Anything else?

03:35.215 --> 03:36.617
( Inhales sharply )

03:36.684 --> 03:38.852
How 'bout them Mets, huh?

03:38.919 --> 03:40.087
I mean, Syndergaard --

03:40.153 --> 03:41.722
that guy stays healthy,
we are gonna --

03:41.789 --> 03:42.856
we're gonna be in it.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.157
We're gonna be in it
for the long haul.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.926
I'm not really a sports guy.
No, you like movies?

03:45.993 --> 03:47.261
'Cause I love that
Sandy Bullock.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.629
Isn't she fantastic?

03:48.696 --> 03:50.264
I will see anything she is in.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.633
Her or Liam Neeson, right?
With the scary phone voice.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.935
( As Liam Neeson )
"I'm coming for ya."

03:55.002 --> 03:56.837
Kevin, you think you're
the first warehouse guy

03:56.904 --> 03:58.071
to make pointless conversation

03:58.138 --> 04:00.107
just to stay in
the air conditioning?

04:00.173 --> 04:02.175
Oh, Mark! ( Laughs )

04:02.242 --> 04:04.111
Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark...

04:04.177 --> 04:06.146
Saying my name
a bunch of times
is not gonna work either.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.616
Here's the deal --

04:08.682 --> 04:10.250
I feel like I'm being
underutilized in the back.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.019
I should be out here
on the sales floor.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.854
I don't tell a lot of
people this,

04:13.921 --> 04:16.824
but my passion,
from when I was born,

04:16.890 --> 04:18.459
has always been electronics.

04:18.526 --> 04:21.395
-Really?
-Yes, you know -- your TVs...

04:21.462 --> 04:24.498
computers, and...vacuum things

04:24.565 --> 04:27.701
and -- and, uh...
those strips, you know,

04:27.768 --> 04:29.670
with, like, a lot of plugs
you can do -- like a --

04:29.737 --> 04:31.672
lot of options
on those things.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.974
Those things are sick.

04:35.776 --> 04:40.448
Please don't make me go
back there. It's very hot.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.015
( Whines )

04:48.956 --> 04:50.658
Should've never gone
out there.

04:50.724 --> 04:53.494
Told you. So it's even
hotter now, right?

04:53.561 --> 04:57.130
It's like we're inside
a bag of popcorn.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.299
-Mr. Gable.
-Chale, what are you
doing here?

04:59.367 --> 05:01.935
I told you that I wanted
a job, so here I am.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.471
I want to contribute
to the wedding

05:03.537 --> 05:04.638
just like everyone else.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.740
And I know that
it is hard work,

05:06.807 --> 05:11.044
but I am not afraid
to get these dirty.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.646
You know what?

05:12.713 --> 05:15.248
Coming down here shows guts
and initiative,
and I like that.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.584
I'll tell you what.

05:16.650 --> 05:20.087
I'm gonna go up front.
I'm gonna talk to Mark.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.557
Can't promise you anything,
but we'll see.

05:23.624 --> 05:24.758
**

05:24.825 --> 05:27.928
How are we still over
on our guest list?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.030
I won't go.
You give me 20 bucks,

05:30.097 --> 05:32.165
and I make sure Sara
doesn't go either.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.067
You're both going.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.837
You know what the problem is
is that all the single people

05:36.904 --> 05:38.105
we invited get a plus one.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.273
So that means that 20 people
we love get to bring

05:40.340 --> 05:42.009
20 losers that we gotta feed.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.944
It's called a wedding.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.579
Yeah, too bad we can't make
all the single people

05:45.646 --> 05:46.747
be each other's dates.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.316
Well, wait, wait, hold on.
What?

05:49.383 --> 05:51.351
Well, who says that
we can't do that?

05:51.419 --> 05:52.953
What,
randomly pair people up?

05:53.020 --> 05:55.623
Well, let's not
do it randomly. Let's put
some thought into it.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.358
All right, what about, um,
what about your friend Steve?

05:58.426 --> 06:00.060
He's single and attractive.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.496
How 'bout we pair him up with,
uh, this girl Shana?

06:02.563 --> 06:03.897
No, they're cousins.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.365
But are they first cousins?

06:05.433 --> 06:08.035
Because if they're not,
that's not that weird.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.603
No, that's still
really weird.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.472
Hey. Kev around?

06:11.539 --> 06:13.541
Some of the boys at
the fire station went hunting,

06:13.607 --> 06:14.942
and he said he wanted
some venison.

06:15.008 --> 06:18.679
Oh. Deer meat...
in a CVS bag.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.414
Well, I had to grab some
cortisone cream.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.950
Eh, it's a long story.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.686
Uh, hey, Uncle Kyle, who are
you bringing to the wedding?

06:25.753 --> 06:27.421
Uh, I'm not sure yet.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.356
It's either gonna be,
um, Crystal,

06:29.423 --> 06:30.624
that lovely gal
from Shop Rite,

06:30.691 --> 06:34.628
or my buddy Chad,
also from Shop Rite.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.197
Okay, but if you haven't
asked anyone yet,

06:37.264 --> 06:38.832
we might have the perfect girl
for you.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.333
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.036
You have my attention.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.605
Oh, jeez.
Oh.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.139
This thing's
startin' to leak.
Ew, ew, ew.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.709
Blood on the floor. Sorry.
Okay, outside,
outside. Please.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.478
Okay, quick, let's find
someone for him.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.045
No, Mom, all of my friends
are way too young.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.380
What about -- what about Kate?

06:53.447 --> 06:54.648
For Uncle Kyle?
Mm-hmm.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.584
Are you crazy? No.
She's a partner at a law firm

06:56.650 --> 06:57.951
and she paid her way
through law school

06:58.018 --> 06:59.352
by being a fitness model.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.855
Yeah, well, you know what else
she is, is single.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.957
Mm-hmm.
Mom, no, I don't know.
That's --

07:04.024 --> 07:06.259
No, no. Kendra, you need to
get on board with these cuts

07:06.326 --> 07:08.562
because as of now,
we have 12 people

07:08.629 --> 07:10.764
eating Yodels
in their cars.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.966
**

07:13.033 --> 07:14.468
Do I need the belt?

07:14.535 --> 07:16.537
Yeah.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.871
It's for back support,

07:17.938 --> 07:19.406
but you're wearing it
like a halter top.

07:19.473 --> 07:22.009
You gotta get it down low.
Ohh.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.578
Uh, thanks for getting me
in here, Mr. Gable.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.880
Yeah. No problem. Come on,
I'll introduce you
to the guys.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.917
Of course you know Rootger.
Over here we got Gator,

07:29.983 --> 07:32.853
that's the Goat,
and right here is Dynamic Bob.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.489
( Flatly )
Hey, welcome to Best Box.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.157
Bang. Dynamic.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.693
Everybody seems to have
a nickname.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.161
Will I be getting one?

07:41.228 --> 07:43.063
Probably gonna
stick with Chale. No doubt.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.364
Hold on to me.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.399
I thought Chale
was your nickname.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.602
Chale is actually
my given name.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.337
Oh, then you need a nickname.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.740
Uh, how 'bout Scott?

07:52.806 --> 07:54.742
Uh, I'm not sure that's
actually --

07:54.808 --> 07:57.945
Too late, Scott.
The die is cast.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.247
All right, guys.
We've got gamers out there.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.816
I'm gonna need hard drives.
5400 RPMs.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.753
Oh.
Uh, actually, sir, for gaming,

08:05.819 --> 08:08.488
you might want to go with
the 7200 RPMs.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.657
( Chuckles )
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.925
I'm totally sorry, Mark.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.694
It's a rookie mistake
right there. He...

08:13.761 --> 08:16.429
No, it's -- it's just that
the 5400s can't keep up

08:16.496 --> 08:18.098
with new gen games.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.233
Plus the 7200s
are more expensive,

08:20.300 --> 08:22.002
so bigger profit margins.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.772
This is embarrassing.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.575
Say goodbye to Scott,
everybody.
Yeah, sorry.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.242
You know what?
Kid makes a good point.

08:29.309 --> 08:32.479
Grab the 7200s. I'm gonna
upsell these nerds, hmm?

08:32.546 --> 08:33.747
Hey, if you really want
to stick it to 'em,

08:33.814 --> 08:34.882
you know what you do?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.817
You sell them the 7300s.
( Chuckles )

08:36.884 --> 08:38.686
They don't make 7300s.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.890
They don't make 7300s.
Here, get the 7200s. Go.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.325
**

08:45.392 --> 08:46.827
Where's the skinny kid?
( Sighs )

08:46.894 --> 08:49.730
We're back on the clock.
He's probably in the bathroom.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.733
His system can't handle
the roach coach food. "Ooh."

08:52.800 --> 08:55.002
Never mind. He's back.

08:55.068 --> 08:58.706
Great news. I've been moved
to the sales floor. ( Laughs )

08:58.772 --> 09:01.208
Can you believe that?

09:01.274 --> 09:03.076
You've only been here, like,
three hours.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.045
I know.
It's been a whirlwind.

09:05.112 --> 09:08.181
Oh, and I just made
my first sale.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.383
( Chuckles )

09:10.450 --> 09:12.485
The customer's kind of
in a rush, so if you could...

09:12.552 --> 09:14.254
( Snaps fingers )
...giddyup, that'd be great.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.831
Is there a problem,
Mr. Gable?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.198
I'm sensing
some hostility here.

09:25.265 --> 09:28.401
You're sensing that?
That what you're sensing?

09:28.468 --> 09:31.438
I get you this job and you
leapfrog me? Not cool.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.941
I don't understand. I'm --
I'm making more money.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.743
Now I get to contribute
to the wedding.

09:35.809 --> 09:36.944
That's not the point, Chale.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.245
You've been working here
half a day,

09:38.311 --> 09:40.480
and they bump you up into
the room with the A/C

09:40.547 --> 09:42.315
and the fancy shirts and --
ooh!

09:42.382 --> 09:44.317
You think you're better
than us?

09:44.384 --> 09:46.519
No, no.
It -- It's not that at all.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.889
We have different abilities.

09:48.956 --> 09:52.259
You have a very low
center of gravity.

09:52.325 --> 09:56.596
Which is fantastic for getting
beneath heavy appliances.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.265
And I have a...

09:58.331 --> 10:01.568
degree in computer science
and marketing.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.070
Yeah, let's not forget
your PhD

10:03.136 --> 10:05.806
in kissing the boss's ass.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.475
I'm sorry?
Yeah, you know what this is?
I'll tell you. Ageism.

10:08.541 --> 10:09.977
Ageism?
Mm-hmm.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.412
Jerry is our top salesman,
and he's 74.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.414
Oh, please.
He's the token gray.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.684
People are only buying things
from him 'cause

10:16.750 --> 10:19.486
they think he's gonna die.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.254
If you could just send this
back on the belt,

10:21.321 --> 10:22.589
I need to get back out front.

10:22.656 --> 10:26.093
It's boiling in here,
and I am beginning to shvitz.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.528
( Belt whirs )

10:28.595 --> 10:29.763
**

10:29.830 --> 10:31.164
So I said, "Hey,

10:31.231 --> 10:32.866
"I'm not gonna bill you
for getting the kitty

10:32.933 --> 10:35.535
out of the tree, but someone's
gonna pay for these pants."

10:35.602 --> 10:38.305
Wow. Brave and funny.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.207
Yeah, and sometimes,
both at the same time.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.809
Yeah.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.211
I, uh, put out a grease fire
once at a comedy club

10:44.277 --> 10:47.881
and stayed for open mic night.
Yep, came in second. Whatevs.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.850
( Laughs )

10:49.917 --> 10:51.819
Kyle, you are too much.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.520
Hey.
Hey.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.255
How's it going?
No, Mom,
what are you doing here?

10:55.322 --> 10:57.524
Well, I came to check up
on Kyle.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.359
He's doing great. Look.
( Gasps )

10:59.426 --> 11:01.328
Did she just touch his arm?

11:01.394 --> 11:03.163
Yeah, and she's been doing
the hair flip.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.198
And I think I even saw
a lip bite.

11:05.265 --> 11:09.870
Ohh. She likes him.
Wait, what's the catch?

11:09.937 --> 11:12.339
Does she have
low self-esteem?

11:12.405 --> 11:16.744
No, no.
She's crazy successful.
I don't get it either.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.445
It's just that I've never seen
a woman, like,

11:18.511 --> 11:19.880
touch your uncle's arm.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.782
I mean, if it wasn't like
a repelling gesture.

11:21.849 --> 11:25.052
Or, like, putting on
a blood pressure cuff.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.520
But, anyway,
I have seen enough here.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.222
I'll go get to work on
some other couples, huh?
Okay.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.058
I'll text you names. Bye.
Okay, bye.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.659
So let's just say
I'm pretty much banned

11:32.726 --> 11:34.061
from the
Empire State building.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.562
Me and King Kong.

11:35.628 --> 11:38.098
( Laughs heartily )

11:38.165 --> 11:41.001
Ugh.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.770
Hmm?

11:42.836 --> 11:45.572
Yesterday, one of our
back room brothers
betrayed us.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.841
He sold us up the river
for nothing.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.777
Sorry, I'm ashamed
of myself.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.245
Not you, Bob.

11:52.312 --> 11:55.916
The man you've come to know
as Scott is gone.

11:55.983 --> 11:59.753
He left us behind like
a candy wrapper
at a Mets game.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.321
You know what?

12:01.388 --> 12:02.890
We may not have
air conditioning

12:02.956 --> 12:06.426
or those fancy coffee machines
with the little flavored pods.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.761
Rootger: Oh, I love those.

12:07.828 --> 12:11.264
The hazelnut
blows my face off.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.000
Yeah, they're awesome.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.701
But you know what
we do have back here?

12:14.768 --> 12:17.004
We got unity, all right?

12:17.070 --> 12:20.173
Now alone, we're just
single fingers, but together,

12:20.240 --> 12:23.043
we ball up into a fist,
a fist of power.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.878
Hey, Gable.
Jerry called in sick.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.214
You want
a shot at sales up front?

12:27.280 --> 12:29.116
I'm just gonna need a minute.

12:33.653 --> 12:36.890
**

12:36.957 --> 12:39.126
What's up?

12:39.192 --> 12:40.961
Mr. Gable, what are you
doing here?

12:41.028 --> 12:42.595
Just waiting for the store
to open.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.597
Getting ready to chow down
on a nice Danish

12:44.664 --> 12:46.934
compliments of the beautiful
break room they got there

12:47.000 --> 12:49.803
only for salespeople.
( Laughs )

12:49.870 --> 12:51.638
So you're
working up here now?

12:51.704 --> 12:54.607
Well, Jerry's sick, and Mark
called me up to the bigs.

12:54.674 --> 12:58.879
What's the matter?
You threatened, Scotty Boy?

12:58.946 --> 13:01.614
Not at all, because when
Jerry returns,

13:01.681 --> 13:03.450
you'll be heading back
to the hot box.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.452
Mm, not a chance.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.620
Once Mark sees my insane
people skills,

13:07.687 --> 13:11.224
the only person going back
to the hot box is you.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.360
( Chuckles )
Dream on.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.062
I'm already
the top salesman.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.564
Oh, and, uh...
( Clears throat ) out here,

13:17.630 --> 13:22.970
they don't call me Scott,
just "The Machine."

13:23.036 --> 13:25.973
Well, Machine, I've already
felt the cool air,

13:26.039 --> 13:28.408
the nice poly blend
against my skin,

13:28.475 --> 13:31.178
so I'm doing
everything it takes
to stay out here.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.546
That's what's happening.
( Laughs )

13:33.613 --> 13:35.015
( Mouth full )
That's pineapple.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.084
( Mouth full ) Oh, man.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.252
Oh. I gotta...

13:39.319 --> 13:41.754
**

13:44.124 --> 13:45.859
Thank you for shopping
at Best Box.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.328
Your warranty is in the bag.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.702
Hey, you looking at
the 65-inch 4K, huh?

13:55.768 --> 13:57.304
It's a game changer.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.539
You'll be sitting at home
watching "Wheel of Fortune."

13:59.606 --> 14:02.109
You'll think you're sitting
on Sajak's shoulders.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.011
( Laughs )

14:04.077 --> 14:06.779
Kevin Gable, sales associate.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.715
Is this one
of those smart TVs?

14:08.781 --> 14:10.350
Oh, yeah. Smart as they come.
Watch this.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.352
Sit. Stay.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.454
( Laughs )

14:14.521 --> 14:16.423
Let's get this bad boy tied
to the roof of your car.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.658
We'll get you home.
I think I'll look around
a little bit more.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.128
Okay, but the sale's not gonna
last much longer.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.064
It says it's on sale
for the whole season.

14:24.131 --> 14:27.134
That sign's, like,
two years old.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.602
Personally, I find that
a good sound system

14:29.669 --> 14:31.939
is as important as
the picture itself.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.441
Now with these, you get
the movie theater experience

14:34.507 --> 14:36.176
without ever
leaving the house.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.111
Trust me, he knows a lot about
not leaving the house.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.279
( Chuckles )

14:39.346 --> 14:41.581
Uh, I will check that
these are in stock

14:41.648 --> 14:43.050
and I'll be sure to get you
a great deal.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.885
Thank you.
By the way,
where are you from?

14:45.953 --> 14:47.887
-We love your accent.
-( Chuckles )

14:47.955 --> 14:49.256
Birmingham, England.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.559
I knew it. Told you.
( Giggles )

14:52.625 --> 14:54.794
Your co-worker's wonderful.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.564
With that accent, he could
sell me anything. ( Laughs )

14:57.630 --> 15:00.667
Not bad for a guy who's just
out on parole. ( Chuckles )

15:00.733 --> 15:02.735
He's still wrestling
with some demons.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.705
But just make sure you get
your credit card back.

15:07.975 --> 15:10.743
Hey, I know why
you're outselling me.

15:10.810 --> 15:15.215
Because I took the time
to read the manuals
on our products?

15:15.282 --> 15:18.451
No, it's the stupid
fake accent.

15:20.487 --> 15:21.955
Oh.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.591
( Exaggerated British accent )
'Ello.

15:24.657 --> 15:28.061
Fancy a subwoofer, do you?

15:28.128 --> 15:31.764
Just looking around,
but I need one
that's HDMI-compatible.

15:31.831 --> 15:35.068
Oh, you're in luck, mate.
They all are.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.070
That's an interesting accent.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.506
-Where you from?
-Right around London.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.142
Where exactly?

15:42.209 --> 15:45.645
By the bridge,
the -- London Bridge.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.514
After it fell down.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.349
They rebuilt it.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.285
Really?

15:52.352 --> 15:55.522
'Cause I used to
live in London,
and nobody talked like you.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.860
Noggin was kicked by a horse
when I was young.

16:02.562 --> 16:05.398
These are all excellent
headphones.

16:05.465 --> 16:09.069
These are more expensive,
but they're the best.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.270
Rootger?

16:10.337 --> 16:13.140
Oh. ( Laughs )
How about those Mets, huh?

16:13.206 --> 16:14.574
Huh.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.077
( Sighs )

16:17.144 --> 16:18.345
Hey.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.847
I need a favor.
And why would I help you?

16:20.913 --> 16:22.515
Traitor.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.684
'Cause I'll buy you lunch,
and -- and --

16:24.751 --> 16:26.853
you can eat it right here.

16:26.919 --> 16:29.356
I so badly want to
say no right now,

16:29.422 --> 16:31.558
but you have found
my Achilles' heel.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.927
( Knock on door )
( Chuckling )

16:34.994 --> 16:36.129
Hey.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.732
Well, hey, there he is,
the ladykiller.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.102
I brought you guys some
new venison.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.770
I don't think that
other stuff was venison.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.574
-Nobody ate it, right?
-No.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.343
So I think we know
who your date
for the wedding's gonna be.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.079
Yeah.
Oh, you talking about Kate?

16:52.145 --> 16:54.081
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, that'd be a hard pass.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.083
What? Why?

16:56.149 --> 16:59.552
Nice gal, but, uh, you know,
the smile was a deal-breaker.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.655
Didn't love the shade
of her choppers.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.457
What? Her teeth are white.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.359
Mm. More of an eggshell.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.162
I need like a new
golf ball white.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.797
Okay, so, let me
get this straight.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.100
We set you up with this
incredible girl
who's into you,

17:13.166 --> 17:14.734
and you don't like her
because her teeth

17:14.801 --> 17:16.203
are not golf ball white?

17:16.269 --> 17:18.171
New golf ball white.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.440
Plus, the girl's got
emotional issues.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.242
When I pulled over to get her
Crest whitening strips,

17:22.309 --> 17:25.145
she flipped out on me.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.347
( High-pitched voice )
"I hate you. I'm not
going to the wedding."

17:27.414 --> 17:29.982
Unstable.

17:30.049 --> 17:34.020
Okay, Kyle. You're aware
that you're 52

17:34.087 --> 17:35.455
and you live alone

17:35.522 --> 17:38.525
and you're kind of shaped
like a peanut M&M, right?

17:38.591 --> 17:40.727
What are you waiting for?

17:40.793 --> 17:42.895
I'm waiting for
the full package.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.134
Can you believe that?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.902
Okay, but actually, if Kate's
not coming to the wedding,

17:49.969 --> 17:51.938
that means no Kate
and no plus one

17:52.004 --> 17:56.075
and that's two people
we just saved. Ka-ching.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.211
You know what? You're right.

17:58.278 --> 18:01.314
You held a mirror to my face,
and I didn't like what I saw.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.150
This is what I do.
I sabotage myself.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.784
That's why I'm alone.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.286
You know what? I'm --
I'm gonna call her.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.787
Her teeth were fine.
What -- but --

18:07.854 --> 18:09.356
But were they?

18:09.422 --> 18:10.823
Mnh.
You know?

18:10.890 --> 18:12.859
I mean, really?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.761
Dingy, right?
I don't know...

18:14.827 --> 18:16.663
Yeah, see? I knew it.
You know what? Forget her.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.030
I deserve better.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.670
I'm sorry.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.205
Uh, I thought we had them
in stock,

18:25.272 --> 18:26.906
but the guys in the back
are saying that we're out.

18:26.973 --> 18:29.542
Oh, okay.
Well, thanks, anyway.

18:29.609 --> 18:34.214
Hey, anybody looking
for a XP 700?

18:34.281 --> 18:36.048
Yeah, well, some of us see
"not in stock"

18:36.115 --> 18:37.450
and they just give up.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.452
Others, we go the extra mile.
Hi. Kevin Gable.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.154
Let's get you rung up.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.523
What's going on here?
This is the third time

18:43.590 --> 18:45.358
the guys in the back told me
something is out of stock

18:45.425 --> 18:46.759
when clearly it is not.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.629
I don't know, but as far as
sales go, I am slaying it.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.598
I just unplugged
"The Machine."

18:51.664 --> 18:53.099
( Imitates
power off sound )

18:53.166 --> 18:54.701
( Typing )

18:54.767 --> 18:56.436
Here you go.
Have a very blessed day,

18:56.503 --> 18:58.805
and remember us for all
your electronic needs.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.208
Mr. Gable, are we not
on the same side?

19:01.274 --> 19:03.210
Are we not just trying to
raise money for the wedding?

19:03.276 --> 19:05.978
We are.
I'm just better at it.

19:06.045 --> 19:08.415
Excuse me, can one of you
grab me an AX 200?

19:08.481 --> 19:09.916
I'm kind of in a rush.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.784
AX 200. I close this puppy,

19:11.851 --> 19:13.085
I'm top salesman
for the day.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.788
Not if I get to it first.
Hey, you --

19:15.855 --> 19:18.124
( Reverse signal beeping )

19:18.191 --> 19:20.059
Rootger, Rootger, I-I need
your help quick.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.494
I need an AX 200 right away.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.296
I'm on break. Union rules.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.664
We don't have a union!

19:24.731 --> 19:26.466
We should.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.867
( Scoffs )

19:27.934 --> 19:30.837
Hey, there's an AX
right there. Bob, Bob. AX 200.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.505
Right there, that box.
Give me that, please.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.441
Oh, no problem.
All right. Come on.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.108
Just need to
inventory it first.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.445
Oh, you're killin' me.
( Laughs )

19:38.511 --> 19:40.513
( Beeping )

19:40.580 --> 19:42.582
Low battery.
( Scoffs )

19:42.649 --> 19:44.517
-Just kick it
into second gear!
-Kick what into second?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.920
Just give me the box.
Throw it!

19:47.987 --> 19:52.659
( Reverse alert beeping )

19:55.362 --> 19:58.030
( Belt whirring )

19:58.097 --> 20:00.533
Ah, sir, I got your AX 200
right here. Just take it!

20:00.600 --> 20:03.336
You gotta take it.
Oh, that's a belly burner!

20:03.403 --> 20:05.204
Take it, sir!
Sir, take it!

20:05.272 --> 20:07.474
Sir, no!

20:07.540 --> 20:08.875
No!

20:10.209 --> 20:13.313
Can I interest you
in our extended warranty?

20:16.916 --> 20:19.652
**

20:19.719 --> 20:22.655
Oh, hey. You know,
I was thinking, um,

20:22.722 --> 20:26.192
out of 162 games, if the Mets'
pitching can just stay healthy

20:26.259 --> 20:28.795
for, like, half of them,
we would be in good shape.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.196
Get back in the hole.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.964
( Scoffs ) Fine,
but I want you to know,

20:32.031 --> 20:33.633
back there,
we are a band of brothers.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.002
So you can just stay up here
by yourself and rot.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.704
All right.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.872
Dynamic Bob?

20:39.939 --> 20:41.140
Yeah.

20:41.207 --> 20:44.777
Out here in the cool air
and the natural light,

20:44.844 --> 20:47.280
he blossomed.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.517
-Go.
-( Scoffs )

20:53.720 --> 20:57.023
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

20:57.089 --> 21:00.627
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

21:00.693 --> 21:02.829
* Do, do, do, do, do

21:02.895 --> 21:04.364
* Do, do, do, do

21:04.431 --> 21:07.967
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

21:08.034 --> 21:11.037
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

21:11.103 --> 21:13.673
* I just don't want no...
