00:11.044 --> 00:14.379
The dead guy
comes in here a lot.

00:14.381 --> 00:16.447
He's gaining strength.

00:16.449 --> 00:20.184
I felt two hands push me
into the stairs.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.719
He's hanging out with his kid.

00:21.721 --> 00:24.189
He scratch.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.724
He goes under the bed,
pushing on the bed.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.062
This is serial killer
mentality.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.597
This is incredibly dangerous.

00:34.734 --> 00:37.669
I don't like this.

00:37.671 --> 00:40.338
And I just feel...fear.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.206
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.208 --> 00:45.476
This is like Grand Central
Station for the dead.

00:45.478 --> 00:46.678
I see dead people.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.880
They have pain
that they suffered.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.882
I speak to dead people.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.618
She hates them, hates them.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.954
And they speak to me.

00:55.956 --> 00:59.357
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

00:59.359 --> 01:00.692
It's a demon.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.960
It's Satan.

01:02.962 --> 01:04.495
I rely on my partner.

01:04.497 --> 01:06.030
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:06.032 --> 01:08.099
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:08.101 --> 01:09.634
What was the body count?
What happened?

01:09.636 --> 01:13.238
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.639
I don't know if it's
a demon or not,

01:14.641 --> 01:16.173
but it sure as hell
looks like one.

01:16.175 --> 01:17.976
It's my job to reveal them.

01:17.978 --> 01:20.444
I feel like I'm crazy.

01:20.446 --> 01:22.313
But Steve and I never speak...

01:22.315 --> 01:24.382
We never communicate
during an investigation...

01:24.384 --> 01:25.784
...until the very end.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.719
I want to show you this.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.988
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

01:29.990 --> 01:32.323
I just don't want anything
to happen to my mother.

01:32.325 --> 01:33.924
Or time to get out.

01:33.926 --> 01:35.326
You have to get out.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074

01:47.541 --> 01:49.407
I'm up here
in Tonawanda, New York.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.609
It's just outside of Buffalo.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.478
I got a call from a woman
named Kerrie.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.481
Now, she's had activity
in her house forever.

01:56.483 --> 01:59.951
She's used to it, but a few
months ago all hell broke loose.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.687
She says it's getting worse by
the day, and if we can't help,

02:02.689 --> 02:04.288
someone's going
to get badly hurt.

02:09.295 --> 02:14.366
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

02:14.368 --> 02:17.969
This home has a lot of family
photographs and furniture

02:17.971 --> 02:20.438
that could influence
her findings,

02:20.440 --> 02:24.775
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

02:24.777 --> 02:28.113
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.462
I don't like this.

02:44.464 --> 02:49.000
Immediately coming in here,
I'm getting, like, head pain...

02:49.002 --> 02:50.602
This hurts.

02:50.604 --> 02:55.807
...feeling extremely sad,
a lot of depression,

02:55.809 --> 02:57.742
a lot of depression here.

03:00.279 --> 03:03.347
It's, like, never-ending.
That makes me nervous.

03:10.156 --> 03:11.823
So, Kerrie,
when we spoke on the phone,

03:11.825 --> 03:13.958
it sounded to me like you're
at the end of your rope.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.693
What's going on
in this house?

03:15.695 --> 03:17.962
The activity is crazy.

03:17.964 --> 03:21.299
As a mom, I should be able
to protect my children

03:21.301 --> 03:25.436
and my granddaughter,
and I feel like I can't do that.

03:25.438 --> 03:26.638
Okay.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.972
Any information
about the house

03:27.974 --> 03:29.541
that you might know,
any history?

03:29.543 --> 03:33.544
We were told the previous owner
had passed away in the home.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.713
Her name was Verna.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.514
Interesting. Okay.
I'll look into that.

03:36.516 --> 03:37.916
You've been here a while,
right?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.984
Yes, since '98.
I remember you saying

03:39.986 --> 03:42.520
that you've always
had activity, right?
Yes, yes.

03:42.522 --> 03:44.856
It was small things,
like you would maybe

03:44.858 --> 03:46.791
hear a little bit
of walking or something.

03:46.793 --> 03:47.925
Well, what changed?

03:47.927 --> 03:49.661
My daughter and granddaughter
moved back in

03:49.663 --> 03:53.731
about 2 months ago,
and it's been unbearable.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.933
It's every single day.

03:55.935 --> 03:58.603
Now, who all lives
in the house with you?

03:58.605 --> 04:01.339
- It is my husband, Tom.
- Okay.

04:01.341 --> 04:04.142
That's myself,
our granddaughter, Bella,

04:04.144 --> 04:06.144
and that's
our daughter, Kayli.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.879
And how old is Bella now?

04:07.881 --> 04:09.080
She's 31/2.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.150
Okay.
I have a son, Keenan.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.218
He actually lived here,
but he had to leave.

04:14.220 --> 04:15.686
He couldn't take it anymore.

04:15.688 --> 04:16.954
He left because of
the activity?

04:16.957 --> 04:18.623
- Yes.
- Do me a favor.

04:18.625 --> 04:22.560
Give me a list of what
is going on in the house.

04:22.562 --> 04:24.429
We hear voices.

04:24.431 --> 04:29.367
Things are moving, shadow
figures, physical attacks.

04:29.369 --> 04:31.769
My health issues have been
getting worse.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.371
Anything specific?

04:33.373 --> 04:37.441
Well, I've always had epilepsy,
but since the last 4 years,

04:37.443 --> 04:39.443
the seizures have been
getting out of control.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.313
I assume you're seeing doctors
about your physical problems.

04:42.315 --> 04:44.182
- Yes.
- So what are they telling you?

04:44.184 --> 04:48.652
They're at their wit's end.
They don't know what's going on,

04:48.654 --> 04:51.055
and I really do feel
like someone

04:51.057 --> 04:55.059
or something
is trying to kill me

04:55.061 --> 04:57.929
or seriously injury me slowly,

04:57.931 --> 05:00.264
and then if I die, like,

05:00.266 --> 05:01.866
then it's going to
move on to Bella.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.270
Okay.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.610
Shh.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.556
There's an older dead woman
here who's pissed off.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.624
She's very upset.

05:26.626 --> 05:29.294
I think she might be causing
a lot of problems here.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.297
There's a dead male here,
too.

05:33.299 --> 05:36.634
He just reminds me of somebody
who would drive a truck.

05:36.636 --> 05:41.572
I think that he comes out here
to, like, escape the chaos.

05:41.574 --> 05:46.176
He was saying that this has
been going on for a while

05:46.178 --> 05:48.847
and that it's been
getting worse.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.248
Do you know if the living
have any experiences with him?

05:51.250 --> 05:53.117
I think that they have
seen him.

05:53.119 --> 05:54.385
I think that they're
catching him

05:54.387 --> 05:56.054
out of the corner of their eye

05:56.056 --> 05:58.923
when he's, you know,
walking out or walking back in.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.533
Okay, so what's going on
in this room?

06:09.535 --> 06:11.602
I was sitting here
on this love seat,

06:11.604 --> 06:15.606
and I seen a reflection
in the china closet,

06:15.608 --> 06:18.676
in the glass, of a man,
like a shadow figure.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.545
Okay. Did you investigate?

06:20.547 --> 06:23.214
Yes, I got up, and I went,
and no one was in the house.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.415
And how often
does that happen?

06:24.417 --> 06:26.817
I would say it's probably
happened at least

06:26.819 --> 06:29.354
six times in a year.

06:29.356 --> 06:30.688
Anything else?

06:30.690 --> 06:32.957
The stairs are a big problem
here in the house.

06:32.959 --> 06:36.160
I was coming up the staircase,
like from doing laundry,

06:36.162 --> 06:38.896
and when I turned
to come up the stairs,

06:38.898 --> 06:41.432
I felt, like, a rush
come up behind me,

06:41.434 --> 06:45.370
and then I felt two hands push
me actually into the stairs.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.704
Okay.
Did you get hurt?

06:46.706 --> 06:49.040
No, I caught myself
on the stairs.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.246
A lot of issues
with the stairs.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.915
For a very long time,
they've been a problem.

06:57.917 --> 07:01.786
Okay, imprint, residual,
I'm getting somebody, a female,

07:01.788 --> 07:04.588
running down the stairs,
yelling and screaming,

07:04.590 --> 07:05.790
"My God."

07:07.994 --> 07:09.260
Trying to find somebody,

07:09.262 --> 07:11.329
somebody who's down here
who's in trouble.

07:11.331 --> 07:14.131
This residual's very...
tangible.

07:14.133 --> 07:16.734
If the living are exposed
to this,

07:16.736 --> 07:19.670
I think that they would feel
like kind of a pressure,

07:19.672 --> 07:23.074
and that might cause them
to have accidents.

07:24.477 --> 07:26.210
It's really bad.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.153
Okay, so what's
going on up here?

07:35.155 --> 07:37.555
One day, I was in Bella's room
rocking her to sleep,

07:37.557 --> 07:39.824
and I felt this scratch.

07:41.694 --> 07:44.628
So when this scratch occurred,
how'd it feel to you?

07:44.630 --> 07:46.097
Like a burn.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.898
After I had the scratch,
that's when I said, "That's it.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.167
Bella's not sleeping
in here anymore."

07:50.169 --> 07:51.702
As you can see, we have,
like, a little bed

07:51.704 --> 07:53.170
over here for Bella.
I see that.

07:53.172 --> 07:54.772
She sleeps with us now

07:54.774 --> 07:58.109
just because the activity
has gotten so crazy.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.044
This is not good.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.113
Yeah.
Anything else?

08:02.115 --> 08:04.182
I would have to say the worst
thing that's happened to me

08:04.184 --> 08:07.518
is one night
we were laying in bed,

08:07.520 --> 08:12.190
and the next thing I knew,
I was literally being held down.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.258
I couldn't breathe.
I couldn't move.

08:14.260 --> 08:15.459
I couldn't do anything.

08:15.461 --> 08:19.597
All I kept thinking was,
"I'm going to die.

08:19.599 --> 08:21.199
They're finally killing me.
Like, they're killing me,

08:21.201 --> 08:22.400
and no one's
going to ever know."

08:28.074 --> 08:32.943
The person here, they are,
like, paralyzed,

08:32.945 --> 08:34.611
and they're panicked,
and they're freaking out.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.884
The old lady is the one
doing this.

08:39.885 --> 08:45.156
She does do stuff when she
gets frustrated and upset,

08:45.158 --> 08:48.292
so this person's
had nightmares,

08:48.294 --> 08:50.561
feeling like they're being
kind of stalked,

08:50.563 --> 08:53.631
oftentimes scared.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.969
So with all this crap
going on,

08:57.971 --> 08:59.437
how the hell are you
sleeping at night?

08:59.439 --> 09:02.640
I'm really not.
I have nightmares all the time.

09:02.642 --> 09:05.643
So I know you're on medication
for your illnesses.-

09:05.645 --> 09:08.513
Any of those medications
possibly causing hallucinations?

09:08.515 --> 09:11.715
No, that's not a side effect
of the medicines that I'm on.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.718
- Okay, so that's ruled out?
- Yes.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.254
Anyone else experiencing
nightmares like you?

09:16.256 --> 09:18.523
Bella actually has
night terrors,

09:18.525 --> 09:20.591
like really bad,
bad night terrors,

09:20.593 --> 09:23.861
and she will scream
her head off.

09:23.863 --> 09:25.195
Amy may turn around
and tell you,

09:25.197 --> 09:27.264
"Listen, this place
is too dangerous."

09:27.266 --> 09:30.267
This is our house,
and we'll do whatever to stay.

09:36.542 --> 09:42.480
The hallway is engulfed with
this thing, and it's all black.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.215
I don't like this.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.884
What the **** is this thing?

09:46.886 --> 09:50.021
All I know is that this dark
entity is very negative

09:50.023 --> 09:51.756
and very bad.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.090
It's feeding off of energy,

09:53.092 --> 09:55.226
which can wreck
the immune system.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.628
You know, things like that
are already occurring,

09:57.630 --> 10:01.432
and they could be susceptible
to all kinds of illnesses

10:01.434 --> 10:03.300
which could, you know,
land somebody

10:03.302 --> 10:05.235
in the hospital or worse.

10:30.862 --> 10:33.063
So, Keenan, I understand
you moved out recently

10:33.065 --> 10:34.664
because of
the paranormal activity.

10:34.666 --> 10:36.199
Mostly because of it, yes.

10:36.201 --> 10:37.868
Obviously,
if paranormal activity

10:37.870 --> 10:39.870
had a reason for you moving out,
you must have had experiences.

10:39.872 --> 10:42.405
Yes.
Okay, so let's talk about
a couple of them.

10:42.407 --> 10:45.341
I mean, just always feeling
like I was being watched.

10:45.343 --> 10:46.676
I never felt, like, at ease.

10:46.678 --> 10:47.810
Like, I always had to look
over my shoulder.

10:47.812 --> 10:48.945
Like, "What's behind me?"

10:48.947 --> 10:50.347
What's that feel like
for you?

10:50.349 --> 10:51.414
Like, you know, you're
walking down the street,

10:51.416 --> 10:52.815
and people
are walking behind you.

10:52.817 --> 10:54.017
You're like, "What's going
to happen right now?"

10:54.019 --> 10:55.552
Okay, anything else?

10:55.554 --> 10:58.287
Well, for example,
Monday night when I left here,

10:58.289 --> 11:01.691
I went home
and just felt horrible,

11:01.693 --> 11:03.893
just like I got ran over
by a truck,

11:03.895 --> 11:05.428
just couldn't
really walk well.

11:05.430 --> 11:06.696
I just -- drained.

11:06.698 --> 11:08.565
When you were here that day,
how long were you here?

11:08.567 --> 11:10.100
Three hours.

11:10.102 --> 11:11.568
Just -- It was the worst
I've ever felt.

11:11.570 --> 11:12.902
I felt like a 90-year-old man.

11:12.904 --> 11:14.437
What do you think is going
on in this house?

11:14.439 --> 11:16.306
I mean, what's your opinion?

11:16.308 --> 11:18.441
I mean, there's definitely
some negative energy,

11:18.443 --> 11:20.310
something just
that doesn't belong.

11:24.449 --> 11:27.717
I don't like it
down here at all.

11:27.719 --> 11:30.920
This room is just filled

11:30.922 --> 11:35.058
with horrible, chaotic,

11:35.060 --> 11:37.193
stagnant energy.

11:37.195 --> 11:39.462
Like, you can't even breathe
in here.

11:39.464 --> 11:41.464
Like, it's making me
physically sick.

11:44.536 --> 11:47.938
Whoever's here in this room
is a sensitive.

11:47.940 --> 11:50.073
I would think a woman was here,

11:50.075 --> 11:52.876
but I'm getting a male
with this.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.145
A male in this space,
a living male,

11:55.147 --> 11:58.615
this person's hearing stuff
all the time, all the time.

11:58.617 --> 12:02.018
Could be a physical medium.
They're freaking themselves out.

12:02.020 --> 12:04.454
It's not good for them at all.

12:11.964 --> 12:13.897
Kayli, you know,
Mom called us in,

12:13.899 --> 12:16.365
and she's concerned
about your daughter, Bella.

12:16.367 --> 12:19.702
Yeah. It's not a good way for
your child to have a childhood.

12:19.704 --> 12:21.905
You know, Mom told me
about her experiences,

12:21.907 --> 12:23.573
but I'm curious
about yours.

12:23.575 --> 12:25.075
Have you had any?

12:25.077 --> 12:27.710
Yeah, I've had multiple
experiences in the house.

12:27.712 --> 12:29.112
I've seen shadow people.

12:29.114 --> 12:32.114
I've seen apparitions
of people.

12:32.116 --> 12:34.317
Now, anything specific
that stands out to you?

12:34.319 --> 12:37.320
I actually seen one
that looked like my dad.

12:37.322 --> 12:39.990
I was sleeping in one
of the downstairs rooms,

12:39.992 --> 12:42.992
and I thought I heard
talking and the door open.

12:42.994 --> 12:45.929
It looked like my dad standing
there, and he was talking to me,

12:45.931 --> 12:47.463
and when I opened
my eyes completely,

12:47.465 --> 12:49.065
there was nothing there,
and the door was shut.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.399
Where was your father?

12:50.401 --> 12:52.602
He was sleeping up here
in his room.

12:52.604 --> 12:55.538
It was just scary,
awful feeling.

12:55.540 --> 12:57.140
Anything else?

12:57.142 --> 12:59.142
When I'm sleeping in my room,
I hear a lot of,

12:59.144 --> 13:00.743
like,
knocking on my door,

13:00.745 --> 13:03.012
and I will go to open it,
and nobody will be there.

13:03.014 --> 13:04.214
Now, what kind of knocking
are we talking about?

13:04.216 --> 13:06.215
Like, a hard knock
or just like a...

13:06.217 --> 13:08.017
No. It would be kind of,
I guess,

13:08.019 --> 13:09.953
you would say like a kid
would be knocking.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.756
Okay, so are you thinking
maybe it's Bella?

13:12.758 --> 13:15.091
I have thought that before,
and when I open the door,

13:15.093 --> 13:16.692
nobody's there.

13:19.364 --> 13:23.032
This dark, negative entity
is making a lot of noise here.

13:23.034 --> 13:24.834
Can you describe the sounds
it's making in the hall?

13:24.836 --> 13:27.903
Man.
It just sounded like chaos.

13:30.909 --> 13:34.176
Taps on the walls, like,
knocking on the walls,

13:34.178 --> 13:35.578
bangs against the walls,

13:35.580 --> 13:38.181
like as if two people
were fighting in the hallway.

13:38.183 --> 13:40.250
That's what it sounds like.

13:41.652 --> 13:43.786
So, Kayli, when you're
talking to Bella,

13:43.788 --> 13:46.189
does she explain to you
what the hell's going on?

13:46.191 --> 13:49.925
She always talks about a little
boy that lives in her closet.

13:49.927 --> 13:51.194
Okay.

13:51.196 --> 13:53.730
I mean, do you think
she'd tell me what's going on?

13:53.732 --> 13:55.865
She might.
We could try.

13:55.867 --> 13:58.201
Bella, come here.
Come here, Belly.

13:58.203 --> 14:01.004
- Hiya, honey.
- Can you say hi?

14:01.006 --> 14:03.473
- Hi.
- Aw.

14:03.475 --> 14:06.743
Bella, Mommy tells me you see
a little boy in the closet here.

14:06.745 --> 14:09.446
Can you tell me
anything about him?

14:14.018 --> 14:16.686
Just a kid.
Does he scare you, honey?

14:16.688 --> 14:20.023
Yeah, because he scratch.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.290
He scratch?

14:21.292 --> 14:23.893
I don't want that
to scratch me.

14:23.895 --> 14:25.295
Yeah, of course not.

14:25.297 --> 14:27.163
We're going to try to get rid
of all the bad people here.

14:27.165 --> 14:29.365
Is that okay?

14:29.367 --> 14:30.766
Yeah.

14:30.768 --> 14:32.969
Yeah.

14:32.971 --> 14:35.772
So, Bella, do you mind
if I finish talking to Mommy?

14:35.774 --> 14:38.908
Can you go with Grandma?
That okay?

14:38.910 --> 14:41.578
Thank you, sweetheart.
Okay, go down.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.379
Okay.
Okay, go to Nonni.

14:43.381 --> 14:45.648
She's a very cute little girl.
Thank you.

14:45.650 --> 14:47.784
She mentioned something
about getting scratched.
Yes.

14:47.786 --> 14:49.252
Have you seen that?
Yes.

14:49.254 --> 14:51.054
We actually have a photo of it
as well.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.923
- Do you have it with you?
- Yes, I do.

14:53.925 --> 14:55.057
Here it is.

14:57.462 --> 15:00.863
So it sounds like what Bella
is describing to you

15:00.865 --> 15:02.665
has got to be
eating you up inside.

15:02.667 --> 15:04.134
Yeah.
It scares me.

15:04.136 --> 15:05.601
It's like you're stuck
in a horror movie,

15:05.603 --> 15:07.537
but you don't know the ending.

15:07.539 --> 15:08.671
Okay.

15:11.009 --> 15:14.177
Unh-unh.
No, I don't like this.

15:16.414 --> 15:20.216
I see a little boy in here,
like full-on,

15:20.218 --> 15:22.352
probably like 5 years old.

15:22.354 --> 15:25.087
I don't think it's a real child,

15:25.089 --> 15:29.559
so I think it's part of this
negative entity that's here.

15:29.561 --> 15:30.760
What is he doing?

15:30.762 --> 15:33.229
I think he's hanging out
with this kid.

15:33.231 --> 15:36.566
He goes under the bed,
pushing on the bed...

15:39.037 --> 15:41.304
...talking, constantly talking.

15:41.306 --> 15:42.838
See, the talking is bad.

15:42.840 --> 15:46.376
He's causing the dreams,
and it's bad.

15:46.378 --> 15:49.645
Like, that I'm getting.
It's not good.

15:49.647 --> 15:51.180
I don't like this.

15:51.182 --> 15:53.649
My stomach doesn't feel good
about this.

15:57.055 --> 15:58.921
Is this dangerous for them?

15:58.923 --> 16:02.091
Psychologically, it's damaging.

16:02.093 --> 16:08.130
It's feeding off of whoever
is in this room.

16:09.601 --> 16:11.401
It's gaining strength,

16:11.403 --> 16:15.872
and ultimately it could lead
to illnesses.

16:15.874 --> 16:17.473
I don't like that.

16:38.295 --> 16:41.029
Kerrie told me the previous
owner died in the house.

16:41.031 --> 16:44.099
Now, clients usually get
this kind of stuff wrong,

16:44.101 --> 16:46.168
but in this case,
it checked out.

16:46.170 --> 16:49.505
I managed to track down two
of the deceased owner's kids.

16:49.507 --> 16:50.906
They grew up in Kerrie's house

16:50.908 --> 16:53.375
and say two other family
members died there, too.

17:00.117 --> 17:01.717
Thanks for meeting me.

17:01.719 --> 17:03.519
It's not often I get to meet
previous homeowners

17:03.521 --> 17:05.053
of my client's house.

17:05.055 --> 17:07.387
So how has it been since
either one of you were here?

17:07.390 --> 17:09.124
Since 1998.

17:09.126 --> 17:10.726
Did you guys grow up here?

17:10.728 --> 17:12.461
Yeah, we did.

17:12.463 --> 17:17.065
My mom and dad bought the house
I think around 1952.

17:17.067 --> 17:21.135
This is a photo of the house
taken in 1960.

17:21.137 --> 17:23.738
I hate to bring up sadness
in your family,

17:23.740 --> 17:26.474
but I understand
your mother actually died here.

17:26.477 --> 17:27.742
Yes.

17:27.743 --> 17:31.279
Mom passed
in January of '98.

17:31.281 --> 17:33.748
Our mother's name
was Verna Weissenburg.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.484
- Well, how old was she?
- 79.

17:36.486 --> 17:37.886
And what was she like?

17:37.888 --> 17:41.422
She was quiet, loved to bake,

17:41.424 --> 17:43.091
made a lot of cookies.

17:43.093 --> 17:45.494
This is a photo of our
mom and dad.

17:45.496 --> 17:48.430
When Dad died,
she wanted to be here alone.

17:48.432 --> 17:51.232
Dad passed in 1997...

17:51.234 --> 17:52.634
Okay.
...in February.

17:52.636 --> 17:55.970
She called me a number
of times after Dad had died,

17:55.972 --> 18:00.442
and she said, "How do you live,
you know, without your spouse?"

18:00.444 --> 18:01.910
That was the worst.

18:01.912 --> 18:04.779
She never really got over
Dad's death.

18:09.252 --> 18:11.987
I'm seeing that old
dead lady again.

18:11.989 --> 18:14.523
This woman, to me,
seems very --

18:14.525 --> 18:18.326
She's very newly dead,
within the last 20 years.

18:18.328 --> 18:21.329
And she's got curly gray hair.

18:21.331 --> 18:25.066
I'd say probably in her
early 70s.

18:29.006 --> 18:30.739
The gray-haired lady

18:30.741 --> 18:33.808
had attachments directly
to this house.

18:33.810 --> 18:35.877
With her, I'm getting the '90s.

18:38.415 --> 18:40.815
Now, you guys mentioned
on the phone that there was --

18:40.817 --> 18:42.884
You knew of, like, two other
people that died in the house.

18:42.886 --> 18:44.352
Who was the first one?

18:44.354 --> 18:46.088
It was Ida Driscoll.

18:46.090 --> 18:48.290
She was our maternal
grandmother.

18:48.292 --> 18:50.425
She died in 1938.

18:50.427 --> 18:54.362
Here's a photo of her
and our mother, Verna.

18:54.364 --> 18:57.366
Ida passed before
both of us were born.

18:57.368 --> 18:59.568
We don't know the cause
of death.

18:59.570 --> 19:01.036
Okay, so that was
the first one.

19:01.038 --> 19:02.571
Who was the second one
that passed?

19:02.573 --> 19:04.840
Our grandfather,
Henry Driscoll.

19:04.842 --> 19:07.909
Here's a photo of him
when he was a young man.

19:07.911 --> 19:10.044
What kind of a man was he?

19:10.046 --> 19:12.447
He was little, hardworking.

19:12.449 --> 19:14.783
He worked at Spaulding Fibre.

19:14.785 --> 19:17.419
He was really a kind
and gentle man.

19:17.421 --> 19:19.520
He was a good guy.

19:19.522 --> 19:21.857
How old was he when he passed?
81.

19:21.859 --> 19:27.929
He died in 1952 in this
back bedroom back here.

19:27.931 --> 19:30.666
This is an obituary of Henry.

19:32.402 --> 19:35.002
This may sound weird,
but I got to ask.

19:35.004 --> 19:37.472
During the time that you guys
were living here,

19:37.474 --> 19:39.474
did anything strange
or unusual happen

19:39.476 --> 19:41.076
that you couldn't explain?

19:41.078 --> 19:44.145
When I was a kid, I used to
have some bad nightmares.

19:44.147 --> 19:45.680
What were they like?

19:45.682 --> 19:49.016
My arms were just --
They felt like lead weights.

19:49.018 --> 19:51.420
- And you couldn't pick them up?
- No, not really.

19:51.422 --> 19:54.022
Strange.

19:54.024 --> 19:55.357
Okay.

19:55.359 --> 19:58.960
There's another
recent death here.

19:58.962 --> 20:01.630
I think it's the trucker guy
from outside.

20:01.632 --> 20:03.832
I know he lived here
at some point.

20:03.834 --> 20:05.901
I can say, like,
either the person

20:05.903 --> 20:08.903
was dying or dead in this area

20:08.905 --> 20:11.372
because I feel that,

20:11.374 --> 20:13.642
and I feel nauseous.

20:18.248 --> 20:22.584
See, the dead guy
comes in here a lot.

20:22.586 --> 20:24.786
Do you know if the living
have any experiences with him?

20:24.788 --> 20:26.321
Maybe they'd see a man,

20:26.323 --> 20:28.723
seeing him out of the corner
of their eyes.

20:28.725 --> 20:31.659
I didn't get any information
on that from him.

20:31.661 --> 20:33.128
Why is it you're having
such a hard time

20:33.130 --> 20:34.663
getting information from him?

20:34.665 --> 20:38.733
The nasty thing upstairs
took his voice.

20:42.139 --> 20:44.272
Now, I just got a call back
from a genealogist

20:44.274 --> 20:46.341
who says
he did some digging.

20:46.343 --> 20:48.610
Turns out, a former owner
of Kerrie's property

20:48.612 --> 20:51.813
lived a tragic life
and died a painful death.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.353
You had mentioned on the phone
this guy, Williams,

20:58.355 --> 21:00.221
had a pretty terrible life.

21:00.223 --> 21:02.957
Before we even get to that,
what do you know about this guy?

21:02.959 --> 21:06.094
William Williams was born
in Massachusetts...

21:06.096 --> 21:07.829
Okay.
...in 1786.

21:07.831 --> 21:10.498
He served as a colonel
in the War of 1812.

21:10.500 --> 21:13.234
His business
was book publishing,

21:13.236 --> 21:14.636
and he was very active
in his church.

21:14.638 --> 21:17.572
He was the superintendent
of the Sunday school.

21:17.574 --> 21:20.174
So what went wrong?
What happened?

21:20.176 --> 21:24.779
He met and married
Sophia Wells in 1811.

21:24.781 --> 21:27.715
14 children were born
to that union.

21:27.717 --> 21:30.185
Unfortunately, only seven
survived to adulthood.

21:30.187 --> 21:32.053
- Seven?
- And it gets worse.

21:32.055 --> 21:34.856
During the birth of
the 14th child, Sophia died

21:34.858 --> 21:37.058
as well, at age 40.
All right.

21:37.060 --> 21:40.795
So in about 20 years, this guy
lost seven kids and his wife?

21:40.797 --> 21:43.264
That's pretty tragic.
What happens to him after that?

21:43.266 --> 21:45.200
He married
the spinster daughter

21:45.202 --> 21:46.668
of one of his
business associates.

21:46.670 --> 21:48.737
His name was Henry Huntington.

21:48.739 --> 21:50.805
- Okay.
- Her name was Catherine,

21:50.807 --> 21:53.475
and so they were
married in 1833.

21:53.477 --> 21:56.144
In 1834, his publishing
business fails.

21:56.146 --> 22:00.215
He's forced to sell off
his business to pay his debtors.

22:00.217 --> 22:02.483
His father-in-law,
he steps in and says,

22:02.485 --> 22:04.352
"Well, let's help out here."

22:04.354 --> 22:08.356
In 1836, Henry Huntington
bought your client's property.

22:08.358 --> 22:10.692
Okay, so Williams lived
on the land,

22:10.694 --> 22:12.494
but his father-in-law
owned it?

22:12.496 --> 22:14.763
- Yes.
- Do things get better for him?

22:14.765 --> 22:16.498
Actually, they got worse.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.366
Shortly after they moved
onto the property,

22:18.368 --> 22:20.302
Henry Huntington,
his father-in-law,

22:20.304 --> 22:22.904
had him removed,
so he became homeless.

22:22.906 --> 22:26.307
So basically his father-in-law
kicks him off the property.

22:26.309 --> 22:27.576
Yeah.

22:27.578 --> 22:29.176
Does his wife stay
with him through this?

22:29.178 --> 22:31.178
No. His wife, Catherine,

22:31.180 --> 22:33.582
moved back to Rome
to take care of her father.

22:33.584 --> 22:35.116
What happens to him after that?

22:35.118 --> 22:39.254
In 1841, he buys a stagecoach
ticket to be with his wife,

22:39.256 --> 22:41.923
and on the way,
the stagecoach tips over.

22:41.925 --> 22:45.393
He lands on his head,
and he suffers a brain injury,

22:45.395 --> 22:49.865
and his mental abilities
were not what they used to be.

22:49.867 --> 22:51.866
This guy's got
a black cloud on him.

22:51.868 --> 22:53.001
That's right.

22:53.003 --> 22:55.670
He becomes a recluse
for the rest of his life.

22:55.672 --> 22:57.939
I've got an obituary here.

23:00.544 --> 23:03.278
He died in Utica,
63 years old,

23:03.280 --> 23:07.282
in 1850,
apparently penniless and alone.

23:12.489 --> 23:15.223
I just saw something
really weird.

23:15.225 --> 23:18.292
It was a male
who'd been skinned.

23:18.294 --> 23:22.297
He didn't have any flesh on his
back, and I'm getting neck pain.

23:23.634 --> 23:26.301
I think this guy brought
the negative entity here.

23:26.303 --> 23:31.973
I felt like it followed this
person from another house.

23:31.975 --> 23:34.376
This guy used to have
really strong ties

23:34.378 --> 23:35.777
to the church and youth.

23:38.782 --> 23:43.118
Something went wrong over, like,

23:43.120 --> 23:47.923
a deal with the business
that used to be here.

23:47.925 --> 23:50.592
Do you have any idea
how this guy died?

23:50.594 --> 23:54.595
I'm getting that neck pain,
that lower head and neck pain.

23:54.597 --> 23:58.199
A fall could cause that,
could cause that kind of damage.

24:00.603 --> 24:04.172
And it ****
hurts like a ****.

24:04.174 --> 24:05.540
My God.

24:11.348 --> 24:13.615

unexplained activity
in your home...

to submit your story,
and we'll help if we can.

24:36.672 --> 24:38.738
So far, I've got a woman
scared to death

24:38.740 --> 24:40.340
about the safety
of her family

24:40.342 --> 24:43.343
in a house where at least
three people have died,

24:43.345 --> 24:46.413
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

24:46.415 --> 24:47.680
Searching through old records,

24:47.682 --> 24:49.415
I find the murder
of a little girl

24:49.417 --> 24:52.352
that took place
in the 1890s.

24:52.354 --> 24:55.555
Turns out, it happened right
in my client's neighborhood.

24:57.959 --> 25:00.026
So I'm heading over to meet
this local journalist

25:00.028 --> 25:01.627
who knows all
about this case.

25:01.629 --> 25:04.964
Now, he says this story
has a lot of twists and turns

25:04.966 --> 25:06.832
and that locals were stunned
when they found out

25:06.834 --> 25:08.768
who actually killed
this poor girl.

25:15.978 --> 25:18.578
Well, Jeff, I appreciate you
helping me out with this case.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.313
So walk me through
this crazy murder.

25:20.315 --> 25:25.918
On July 8, 1892, there was
a young 2-year-old girl.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.654
Her name was Lowena Stermer,

25:27.656 --> 25:29.455
and she was playing
in the neighborhood,

25:29.457 --> 25:31.724
and when she came home,
her mother looked at her,

25:31.726 --> 25:33.126
and she's deathly pale.

25:33.128 --> 25:35.262
She's got black circles
around her eyes.

25:35.264 --> 25:37.597
Her mother brought in
a doctor,

25:37.599 --> 25:40.667
and the doctor thought,
"This is probably cholera,"

25:40.669 --> 25:43.003
but unfortunately,
by 10 p.m. that night,

25:43.005 --> 25:45.338
Lowena Stermer is dead.

25:45.340 --> 25:48.808
We know Lowena was murdered.
So how'd they figure that out?

25:48.810 --> 25:50.343
Because 5 days later,

25:50.345 --> 25:51.945
three other kids
in the neighborhood

25:51.947 --> 25:54.880
got sick as well,
through similar symptoms,

25:54.882 --> 25:58.618
but they all survived their
ailments after some vomiting.

25:58.620 --> 26:00.753
How did they eventually
make a collar on this?

26:00.755 --> 26:03.423
When the kids were asked
what was going on,

26:03.425 --> 26:06.426
they talk about having been
given a cocoa drink

26:06.428 --> 26:08.561
by another neighborhood girl,

26:08.563 --> 26:11.364
a 14-year-old
named Ella Holdridge.

26:11.366 --> 26:14.567
Ella was questioned,
and eventually she did confess

26:14.569 --> 26:19.172
to mixing rat poison into drinks
and giving it to these kids.

26:19.174 --> 26:21.908
You're kidding?
Any idea what the motive was?

26:21.910 --> 26:26.446
Ella was fascinated with death,
the macabre.

26:26.448 --> 26:27.847
She loved coffins.

26:27.849 --> 26:31.985
She loved corpses, and she
wanted to see a pretty corpse,

26:31.987 --> 26:34.854
and I have an article here
that shows you that

26:34.856 --> 26:36.756
while the 2-year-old
was sick,

26:36.758 --> 26:37.857
Ella would sneak out
of her house

26:37.859 --> 26:39.725
and go look in
the neighbor's window.

26:39.727 --> 26:42.395
She came back home and told
her stepmother gleefully,

26:42.397 --> 26:44.130
"It looks like
she's going to die."

26:44.132 --> 26:48.001
This is some, you know,
serial killer type mentality

26:48.003 --> 26:49.335
in a 14-year-old girl.

26:49.337 --> 26:52.472
Yeah, and this all happened
a few hundred yards

26:52.474 --> 26:54.741
from the property
you're investigating.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.743
So what happens to
this psychopath?

26:56.745 --> 26:59.479
She was actually taken
to a reformery

26:59.481 --> 27:00.813
right outside of Buffalo,

27:00.815 --> 27:04.084
but ultimately
she was never prosecuted.

27:04.086 --> 27:06.152
All right, so basically,
she commits murder.

27:06.154 --> 27:07.887
She doesn't get convicted
of anything,

27:07.889 --> 27:09.455
I guess because of the age,

27:09.457 --> 27:12.158
and she winds up living
a normal life after that?

27:12.160 --> 27:13.426
Yeah.

27:17.565 --> 27:19.632
Something went wrong.

27:19.634 --> 27:22.301
It does have to do
with the neighborhood.

27:22.303 --> 27:24.237
People were yelling
and panicking...

27:26.708 --> 27:28.308
...screaming,
"Help me! Help me!"

27:28.310 --> 27:30.109
Screaming, yelling, crying,

27:30.111 --> 27:33.512
and there is something
with a hospital.

27:33.514 --> 27:36.783
I'm seeing three babies
that were dead.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.318
It's really bad.

27:50.432 --> 27:53.666
I saw several disturbing
things during my walk,

27:53.668 --> 27:55.801
but the dead little boy
tormenting

27:55.803 --> 27:59.939
a living girl upstairs
had me the most concerned.

27:59.941 --> 28:06.079
She's lying on the bed,
and he is lifting this bed,

28:06.081 --> 28:08.815
freaking out the little girl.

28:08.817 --> 28:10.483
Yeah, maybe do the bed bigger.

28:10.485 --> 28:12.485
Okay.

28:12.487 --> 28:18.291
Across from the bed is, like,
this unnatural blackness.

28:18.293 --> 28:21.428
The little boy under the bed,
he's part of it.

28:26.768 --> 28:28.634
Amy, is this what you saw?

28:31.706 --> 28:33.173
Yes.

28:48.488 --> 28:51.422
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

28:51.424 --> 28:53.625
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

28:53.627 --> 28:56.828
and our clients
for the first time.

28:56.830 --> 29:00.598
So, Amy, this is Kerrie,
and this is her daughter, Kayli.

29:00.600 --> 29:03.167
Now, a few months ago,
Kayli here moved in

29:03.169 --> 29:05.036
with her
3- year-old daughter, Bella.

29:05.038 --> 29:07.104
Basically, Bella is the reason
that we're here.

29:07.106 --> 29:09.707
Since they came back,
activity has been violent,

29:09.709 --> 29:13.044
and these two don't think
it's safe for anyone to be here.

29:13.046 --> 29:15.513
So now that Amy knows
who you guys are,

29:15.515 --> 29:17.648
I'll ask her to describe
her walk for us.

29:21.388 --> 29:25.656
When I went down
into the basement,

29:25.658 --> 29:29.193
there was an overwhelming
amount of energy,

29:29.195 --> 29:32.997
and it just got
progressively more intense

29:32.999 --> 29:37.134
as I went into the bedroom.

29:37.136 --> 29:41.072
And the energy
I was picking up

29:41.074 --> 29:45.009
was coming from
a living person

29:45.011 --> 29:47.612
that is down there.

29:47.614 --> 29:52.883
I felt that that individual
is a physical medium.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.287
First I got that
this was a female,

29:56.289 --> 29:59.357
and then I was
leaning towards a male.

29:59.359 --> 30:01.692
Amy, there's something you
ought to know about that room.

30:01.694 --> 30:03.361
Up until a few months ago,
Kerrie's son,

30:03.363 --> 30:05.497
Keenan,
was living down there.

30:05.499 --> 30:08.500
Now, he told me while he was
there, he felt drained

30:08.502 --> 30:10.301
and like he had been
hit by a truck.

30:10.303 --> 30:11.435
Yeah.

30:11.437 --> 30:12.837
It got so bad
he actually moved out.

30:12.839 --> 30:14.439
That makes sense.

30:14.441 --> 30:16.441
So you said you couldn't tell
if it was a male or a female,

30:16.443 --> 30:18.309
but Kayli lives down there now.
Okay.

30:18.311 --> 30:21.112
And she's having a bunch
of experiences.

30:21.114 --> 30:24.449
Could one of them
be a medium, or both?

30:24.451 --> 30:28.586
It would be likely that
you are both sensitives.

30:30.990 --> 30:33.725
- I'm not surprised.
- Okay.

30:33.727 --> 30:35.259
We see people, like,

30:35.261 --> 30:38.062
all the time
and feel people all the time.

30:38.064 --> 30:39.264
It's overwhelming.

30:43.069 --> 30:45.202
So what else?

30:45.204 --> 30:48.072
Coming around
to the front stairs,

30:48.074 --> 30:56.614
I got hit with this intense
residual event that took place.

30:56.616 --> 31:01.086
I saw a female rushing down
the stairs,

31:01.088 --> 31:02.821
and she was freaking out.

31:02.823 --> 31:05.022
People would feel it,

31:05.024 --> 31:08.560
the rushing or feeling
like a slight pushing.

31:08.562 --> 31:13.498
Tell Amy about you getting
pushed into the stairs.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.766
As I turned to walk up
the stairs,

31:15.768 --> 31:18.436
I could feel this rush.

31:18.438 --> 31:20.571
And I literally, like,
fell into the stairs.

31:20.573 --> 31:22.640
Okay.

31:22.642 --> 31:24.576
I see what's
going on here now.

31:31.118 --> 31:34.718
The next person I want
to talk to you about

31:34.720 --> 31:38.656
is a dead male
that I encountered.

31:38.658 --> 31:40.525
I kept calling him the trucker

31:40.527 --> 31:42.460
because that's what
he reminded me off.

31:42.462 --> 31:44.729
He seemed to be in his 40s,

31:44.731 --> 31:47.932
and he was indicating to me that
he lived here at some point.

31:47.934 --> 31:53.003
I think he either died here, or
he began his dying process here.

31:53.005 --> 31:55.540
He can go everywhere,

31:55.542 --> 32:00.678
but he enjoys being
in this bedroom down here.

32:02.749 --> 32:04.282
You may perceive it
as more of like

32:04.284 --> 32:08.019
a dark figure versus a male.

32:08.021 --> 32:09.354
Um...

32:09.356 --> 32:11.823
when I sit on the couch,

32:11.825 --> 32:15.626
I can see into the reflection
of the china closet.

32:15.628 --> 32:17.962
I can see just there's
a shadow fig--
Gotcha.

32:17.964 --> 32:22.100
Like a man, and he stands,
like, in front of the kitchen.

32:22.102 --> 32:25.503
I have a pretty good idea
of who you might have seen.

32:25.505 --> 32:28.306
So the guy I'm thinking of
is named Henry Driscoll.

32:28.308 --> 32:31.910
Now, he's the guy that built
this house back in 1916,

32:31.912 --> 32:35.980
and at the time he built
the house, he was 45.

32:35.982 --> 32:38.850
I got a photo of him
when he was young.

32:38.852 --> 32:40.518
This is Henry.

32:43.790 --> 32:46.391
So I spoke to the grandkids,

32:46.393 --> 32:49.260
and they said he was
a real blue-collar guy.

32:49.262 --> 32:52.130
He actually worked his whole
career in a factory in town.

32:52.132 --> 32:54.032
He had lived in this house
for over 35 years.

32:54.034 --> 32:57.936
Now, we don't know what
the exact cause of death was,

32:57.938 --> 33:01.739
but we know he was bedridden
here in his final years.

33:01.741 --> 33:05.477
So Henry wound up dying in 1952
right in that back bedroom.

33:05.479 --> 33:07.679
Okay, that makes sense.

33:10.216 --> 33:12.750
Is there anything else?

33:12.752 --> 33:15.820
I did encounter
an old woman.

33:15.822 --> 33:18.155
She looked to me to be
in her 70s.

33:18.157 --> 33:21.559
She has glasses.
She has gray hair.

33:21.561 --> 33:24.629
She lived here in the 1990s.

33:26.299 --> 33:29.033
Okay.

33:29.035 --> 33:32.836
So -- And I'm pretty sure she
died within the last 20 years,

33:32.838 --> 33:36.707
and I got a stroke
or a heart attack.

33:36.709 --> 33:38.242
I'm pretty sure I know
who you saw.

33:38.244 --> 33:41.111
I'm guessing Kerrie does,
as well.

33:41.113 --> 33:42.380
The previous owner of this house

33:42.382 --> 33:45.115
was a woman named
Verna Weissenburg.

33:45.117 --> 33:47.384
Now, Verna was
Henry Driscoll's daughter.

33:48.989 --> 33:52.256
She was born in this house,
and she died in this house.

33:52.258 --> 33:53.992
Now, you said the woman
lived here in the '90s.

33:53.994 --> 33:56.461
Verna died over here
in the kitchen in 1998.

33:58.465 --> 34:00.331
Said she was in her 70s.

34:00.333 --> 34:03.134
Verna was 79 when
she died in this house.

34:03.136 --> 34:07.738
One of the kids gave me
a photo of Verna.

34:07.740 --> 34:09.139
This is her right here.

34:09.141 --> 34:11.342
Do you think this is
who you saw?

34:11.344 --> 34:14.277
I think it's her.

34:14.280 --> 34:18.549
So her thing is, is that
she gets irritated

34:18.551 --> 34:20.484
with the living people here.

34:20.485 --> 34:24.088
She is in the big bedroom
upstairs

34:24.090 --> 34:26.824
pretty much
all the time.

34:26.826 --> 34:29.493
- That's Kerrie's room.
- Okay.

34:29.495 --> 34:32.163
She does stare
at the living,

34:32.165 --> 34:34.032
and she does it intently.

34:35.568 --> 34:38.770
And she did show me

34:38.772 --> 34:43.174
her...holding...

34:43.176 --> 34:48.446
I guess you down
in the bed up there.

34:48.447 --> 34:52.583
So the one night I was laying,
and I woke up, and I, like,

34:52.585 --> 34:55.518
felt being, like, watched,
and I couldn't breathe.

34:55.521 --> 34:57.255
I couldn't move.
I couldn't yell.

34:57.257 --> 35:01.058
I couldn't do anything,
and all I kept thinking was,

35:01.060 --> 35:05.263
"My God.
Like, the house is finally --

35:05.265 --> 35:06.731
It's going to kill me."

35:11.470 --> 35:14.538
So this is all Verna
holding her down.

35:14.540 --> 35:16.007
The feeling
of being watched...

35:16.009 --> 35:17.408
- Yes.
- ...is all Verna?

35:17.410 --> 35:19.109
Yes.

35:22.682 --> 35:25.283
But she's not what
I'm concerned about.

35:25.285 --> 35:27.085
I'm worried about the entity

35:27.087 --> 35:30.354
that I saw
in the upstairs hallway.

35:30.356 --> 35:33.157
This is just a mass
of negative energy.

35:33.159 --> 35:35.893
Like, there's no real shape
to it.

35:35.895 --> 35:38.496
It's just this blackness.

35:38.498 --> 35:41.032
I think a previous owner
brought it here.

35:41.034 --> 35:42.700
It's powerful.

35:42.702 --> 35:46.304
It does on occasion
make a lot of noise.

35:46.306 --> 35:48.840
I'm looking out at the hallway,
and all I'm hearing is, like,

35:48.842 --> 35:52.243
yelling, screaming,
knocking sounds, commotion.

35:52.245 --> 35:56.080
I hear knocking on
my bedroom door.

35:56.082 --> 35:57.915
You hear knocking all around
the house,

35:57.917 --> 36:00.384
banging all around the house.

36:00.386 --> 36:01.652
It can take your energy,

36:01.654 --> 36:04.522
which then can break down
your immune system.

36:04.524 --> 36:06.123
Your immune system goes.

36:06.125 --> 36:08.726
You start getting sick.
You start getting sick.

36:08.728 --> 36:11.396
You start getting
seriously sick.

36:11.398 --> 36:12.996
Your health has been declining,
Kerrie, right?

36:12.998 --> 36:14.198
Yes.

36:14.200 --> 36:17.134
I have epilepsy
since I've been 6,

36:17.136 --> 36:21.272
but over the past 4 years,
like, it's gotten worse,

36:21.274 --> 36:23.941
and the doctors are just...

36:23.943 --> 36:27.078
like, don't even know
what to do.

36:27.080 --> 36:31.281
Also, what this thing can do
is borrow forms,

36:31.283 --> 36:35.086
and it can appear good,
bad, ugly.

36:35.088 --> 36:36.821
Remember you thought
you saw your father?

36:36.823 --> 36:38.956
- Yes.
- Tell Amy what happened.

36:38.958 --> 36:41.759
I was sleeping in this back room
over here.

36:41.761 --> 36:44.162
I heard the door open, and it
sounded like he was talking.

36:44.164 --> 36:46.831
I opened my eyes.
It looked like him.

36:46.833 --> 36:48.566
Closed my eyes, opened my eyes
back up, he wasn't there.

36:48.568 --> 36:50.234
Door was shut.
Nobody was there.

36:50.236 --> 36:53.904
So this darkness thing
borrowed Tom's likeness?

36:53.906 --> 36:55.706
Yes.

36:55.708 --> 36:58.242
Did this thing appear to you
in any other way?

36:58.244 --> 37:01.912
I went into
the middle bedroom.

37:01.914 --> 37:03.914
Bella's room.

37:03.916 --> 37:09.253
I was in the closet,
and I saw this little boy.

37:09.255 --> 37:13.323
Kayli, you tell Amy
about the little boy Bella sees.

37:13.325 --> 37:15.593
- So she does see a little boy?
- Yeah.

37:15.595 --> 37:19.463
She says that he lives
in her closet,

37:19.465 --> 37:23.267
and she says that he lives
next to her bed.

37:23.269 --> 37:26.470
She gets hit in the face.
She's been scratched.

37:26.472 --> 37:28.673
She's been punched
in the stomach.

37:28.675 --> 37:31.876
- So I actually have a photo.
- This is a scratch she got.

37:36.015 --> 37:39.083
I saw him
going under the bed.

37:39.085 --> 37:42.887
He goes under the bed,
pushing on the bed...

37:45.024 --> 37:47.291
...talking,
constantly talking.

37:47.293 --> 37:49.760
See, the talking is bad.

37:49.762 --> 37:53.497
What I was seeing was that
this little dead child

37:53.499 --> 37:58.569
was causing the living child
horrible nightmares.

37:58.571 --> 37:59.903
She was having nightmares
so bad

37:59.905 --> 38:02.974
that she sleeps
in Kerrie's room now.

38:02.976 --> 38:07.011
I did have a sketch done
of what I saw.

38:13.787 --> 38:15.853
Annoying little ****,
right?

38:25.064 --> 38:26.798
I mean, she's a baby.

38:33.606 --> 38:37.208
That's what she describes.

38:37.210 --> 38:38.943
She's been going through
a lot, that kid.

38:43.683 --> 38:45.683
She said the only time
that he ever leaves her alone

38:45.685 --> 38:48.018
is when she tries
to close her eyes,

38:48.020 --> 38:51.688
but clearly he's not
leaving her alone.

38:51.690 --> 38:56.961
She is, like, a little,
tiny supernova of energy,

38:56.963 --> 39:01.365
and this thing
is attracted to that

39:01.367 --> 39:05.036
because it can feed off
of that energy.

39:05.038 --> 39:10.107
This is like an extremely
detrimental situation for her,

39:10.109 --> 39:13.710
not only physically
but mentally.

39:13.712 --> 39:17.248
This is incredibly dangerous.

39:39.471 --> 39:43.473
So, Kerrie, Kayli, you both got
a lot of information tonight

39:43.475 --> 39:46.609
and probably a hell of a lot
more than you bargained for,

39:46.611 --> 39:49.079
but now you know
who's terrorizing Bella

39:49.081 --> 39:51.013
and destroying your health.

39:51.015 --> 39:53.283
But we still haven't answered
your biggest question --

39:53.285 --> 39:55.485
Is there anything
you can do to fix this?

39:55.487 --> 39:57.087
For that answer, I'm going to
turn it over to Amy.

40:02.427 --> 40:06.095
This negative energy
that is attached to Bella

40:06.097 --> 40:08.431
needs to be removed,

40:08.433 --> 40:10.900
so I'd like you to find
a Reiki master

40:10.902 --> 40:13.503
who is also a psychic,

40:13.505 --> 40:17.774
and I want Bella to go

40:17.776 --> 40:20.776
and have any and all cords

40:20.778 --> 40:24.513
from this negative energy
removed.

40:24.515 --> 40:31.254
The next step is for the same
Reiki master psychic

40:31.256 --> 40:37.327
to come to the house and collect
all of the negative energy

40:37.329 --> 40:41.264
that's in this house
from every nook and cranny.

40:41.266 --> 40:43.466
Once this thing's
out of the house,

40:43.468 --> 40:46.135
you'll notice
a big difference.

40:46.137 --> 40:47.937
Now, will this get rid
of all the dead people here?

40:47.939 --> 40:49.939
Yes.

40:49.941 --> 40:55.077
And once the Reiki master
has completed their session,

40:55.079 --> 40:58.548
Bella can easily come back.

40:58.550 --> 41:02.618
The other thing I would like
you guys to do

41:02.620 --> 41:08.692
is a specific grounding
meditation one time per week.

41:08.694 --> 41:12.495
It temporarily shuts you down.

41:12.497 --> 41:15.465
Now, by doing this,

41:15.467 --> 41:20.770
the dead are going to see
a sign going up

41:20.772 --> 41:22.438
that says, "Closed."

41:22.440 --> 41:24.641
Okay?

41:24.643 --> 41:28.244
And they're going to leave.

41:28.246 --> 41:29.846
I mean, are you going to do
what Amy tells you?

41:29.848 --> 41:30.981
100 percent.
Yeah.

41:30.983 --> 41:32.449
Definitely.

41:32.451 --> 41:36.852
If it means Bella being safe,
we would do whatever it took.

41:36.854 --> 41:40.990
I really hope Kerrie and Kayli
follow all of my advice.

41:40.992 --> 41:45.394
If they do, they'll be able
to live in their house in peace,

41:45.396 --> 41:48.798
and most importantly, Bella will
have a normal childhood.

41:56.408 --> 41:58.874
Hi, guys. I wanted to give you
a quick update and let you know

41:58.876 --> 42:00.676
how things were going
here at the house.

42:00.678 --> 42:02.078
Claire came by yesterday,

42:02.080 --> 42:05.482
and she cleansed the house
of all the negativity,

42:05.484 --> 42:06.749
and everyone slept great.

42:06.751 --> 42:08.151
We all slept through the night.

42:08.153 --> 42:10.153
There were no nightmares
or anything.

42:10.155 --> 42:12.889
Bella feels great sleeping
in her room by herself,

42:12.891 --> 42:15.959
so it's wonderful, so thank you
so much for all of your help.

42:15.961 --> 42:18.094
We are so appreciative.
Thank you so much.
