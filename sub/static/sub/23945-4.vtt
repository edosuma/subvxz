[dispatcher speaking indistinctly]

00:34.159 --> 00:37.954
[tense music playing]

00:38.371 --> 00:39.664
[Kevin] Read it to me.

00:39.748 --> 00:42.667
[Chester] Four males with guns
across from the store,

00:42.751 --> 00:45.378
at the southwest corner
in a black Ford Fusion.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.923
[Kevin] Do you see a black Ford Fusion?

00:49.966 --> 00:51.050
[Chester] Right there.

00:53.970 --> 00:57.849
[tense music playing]

01:03.021 --> 01:04.813
[Kevin] If you're not buying, get walking.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.150
Why did they say you're locked and loaded?

01:07.233 --> 01:09.778
[man] No guns in there.
That's my girl's car.

01:09.861 --> 01:10.904
[Kevin] Check the hood.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.701
[Kevin] Man,
I've had better days, brother.

01:16.785 --> 01:20.121
When we roll up here, there's 50 people
and they're calling, "man with guns."

01:20.205 --> 01:22.499
-[Lucky] Really?
-[Kevin] Yes. That's why we came.

01:22.582 --> 01:26.419
[Kevin] We're not gonna keep coming
to this store and everybody's hanging out.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.963
-[Kevin] No shootings.
-[Lucky] We don't want shootings.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.549
[Kevin] But you're gonna have it
with everybody hanging out.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.135
You have to shoo them away,

01:34.219 --> 01:37.889
because you're gonna have a shooting,
then they're gonna shut you down.

A ten-year-old was shot
in the parking lot,

then this past weekend,
a man was shot and killed there.

01:54.906 --> 01:59.619

was found dead from gunshot wounds.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.420
I have nothing to do
with what happens outside.

2407 Martin Luther King, Liquor Plus.

Don't think we're just gonna walk in there
and people are gonna say, "OK."

02:56.217 --> 02:58.011
So watch each other's backs.

Check for guns, check for drugs.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.640
We are gonna do a protective sweep,

03:02.724 --> 03:05.101
and we are gonna do a dog
through the building.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.020
So we will standby for that,

03:07.103 --> 03:09.772
until Urquhart delivers
the keys to the wife.

03:09.856 --> 03:13.401
[Keith] I have the new chain and lock
that we'll attach to the door.

03:13.484 --> 03:17.030

is the chief of police and the owner.

[Esther] Let's stay on one just in case
shit goes to hell in a handbasket.

03:20.575 --> 03:24.120
I don't expect shots to be fired at us,
but be prepared for anything.

03:24.579 --> 03:27.123
Any questions? Terrance, not a one?

03:27.206 --> 03:30.543

[Esther] You're free to leave.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.833
[Keith] Get out.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.128
What's happening, big dog?
Sergeant Urquhart, Flint Police.

04:14.212 --> 04:17.005
Alright. This store is closed immediately.
You understand?

04:17.089 --> 04:18.800
So, I'll walk around with you.

04:18.882 --> 04:22.387
My officers are gonna make sure
there's no bodies inside this place.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.890
We're gonna have a dog come in,
make sure there's no drugs.

04:25.974 --> 04:29.269
I don't want you to get bit in the balls.
Canine coming.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.979
[Esther] Canine.

04:32.897 --> 04:36.609
Good evening. I'm Sergeant Urquhart.
This is my partner, Sergeant Campbell.

04:37.735 --> 04:40.238
This store has been ordered to close.

04:40.738 --> 04:43.825
[Sukhjinder] I mean, I understand that.
Crime is everywhere.

04:43.908 --> 04:47.036
It is, but here, specifically,
it compounded to the point

04:47.120 --> 04:49.289
that they deemed it necessary
that this store close.

04:49.372 --> 04:52.417
-[Sukhjinder] That is not fair.
-[Keith] You have a reason.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.836
[Sukhjinder] That is not fair to me.
I have three kids.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.714
How many at this store?
The church, their college?

04:57.797 --> 05:01.175
[Esther] You can't plead your case to me
because I'm not the judge.

05:01.259 --> 05:05.888
We have a job, because you are responsible
for what goes on on your property.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.391
And if there's illegal crimes happening...

05:08.474 --> 05:11.686
[Sukhjinder] Do I have to stand outside
to watch people?

05:11.769 --> 05:14.605
-[Sukhjinder] I can't stand on the street.
-[Keith] This is the key.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.734
The only reason this store
needs to be opened is for maintenance.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.611
-[Sukhjinder] Use your power, fine.
-[Keith] Thank you. Let's go.

05:20.695 --> 05:24.574
Get your keys. I'll give you a copy.
It explains everything that happens.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.785
-[Sukhjinder] Make sure you have a copy.
-[Keith] I do. OK.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.705
Your store will be padlocked.
Have a better day, hopefully.

05:30.788 --> 05:33.916
[Sukhjinder] A better day?
Do you want me to stand outside?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.461
[Keith] Listen, I don't know
what to tell you to do.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.715
Have a nice day, lady.

05:40.798 --> 05:44.677
The next word out of my mouth is gonna
put you in the back of my patrol car.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.888
[Sukhjinder] For saying "thank you"?

05:50.141 --> 05:52.435
[Keith] Yeah. It is what it is.

[John] Alright, let's see,
a couple of things.

07:06.050 --> 07:09.720
As far as the shooting yesterday...
There was a critical shooting.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.890
A guy got shot with an AK
right in the groin area.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.725
He's in critical.

07:14.809 --> 07:19.230
Detectives spoke with him last night,
and he wasn't cooperative at first,

07:19.313 --> 07:22.358
but he ended up
giving up some information.

07:23.568 --> 07:27.155
Dion, do you have any questions?
This is your first time, correct?

07:27.238 --> 07:28.072
Yes, sir.

07:28.156 --> 07:31.117
OK. Well, we are short tonight.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.913
Volker's off sick, Cramer's sick,
and Cornell Jones is off on annual.

07:35.997 --> 07:39.208
So, we're right at
minimum staffing right now.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.086
So, be safe. Have a good night.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.057
My girl's stressing.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.730
-[John] Are you stressing?
-No, my girl is.

[John] So I'm taking King up to what, now?

08:29.675 --> 08:33.261
It doesn't mean I don't know
where I'm going. I'm just quizzing you.

08:33.346 --> 08:37.683
I'm gonna act like the new officer,
and you need to tell me where to go.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.309
It helps with geography.

08:39.977 --> 08:45.274
[Dion] I was born and raised in Flint,
on the south end, more so. So...

08:45.358 --> 08:47.527
-[John] You know how to get to Hurley?
-Yeah.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.694
[John] That's important.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.697
That's the number-one place you need
to know how to get to in the city.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.409
If one of us gets shot,
we don't wait for the ambulance.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.327
Right.

08:56.410 --> 09:01.582
[John] You get shot, I'm gonna throw you
in the truck and we'll go. Same with me.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.966
[cop speaking indistinctly over radio]

09:10.049 --> 09:11.217
[Dion] Are we going in?

09:11.300 --> 09:14.095
[John] Just step inside
and see how it looks in there.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.187
[John] Hold it there.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.562
[John] If we don't see nobody,
we'll get the hell out.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.522
Yeah, we're going out.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.442
That room's full of feces and urine.

10:12.236 --> 10:15.072
Yeah, the bedroom upstairs
has got clothes in it.

10:15.156 --> 10:19.327
And like you said, there's human waste
and urine in the toilet,

10:19.410 --> 10:21.537
so somebody's staying in there.

-[TJ] Yeah.

[John] He said they just put out
"Flint Park, for a stabbing."

10:33.424 --> 10:35.676
[TJ] No, they asked our status.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.678
Oh, it sounded like they said "stabbing."

10:39.472 --> 10:40.556
[John] Alright, rookie!

Alright, on to the rest

[Devon] I don't know
how you could not be aware of this,

11:37.738 --> 11:42.493
but last night in Dallas
at about ten p.m.,

11:43.160 --> 11:48.290
there was a gathering of citizens
from the community.

11:48.791 --> 11:53.087
Several Dallas police officers
were assigned to that

11:53.170 --> 11:56.090
for the purpose of protecting the citizens

11:56.173 --> 11:58.884
that were participating
in that demonstration.

11:59.468 --> 12:02.388
A former army reservist,

12:02.471 --> 12:04.598
who had done tours in Afghanistan,

12:05.599 --> 12:07.685
took advantage of that opportunity

12:07.768 --> 12:12.481
and opened fire on the police officers
with a high-powered rifle.

12:14.859 --> 12:18.863
Last thing that I saw is,
12 of them were hit.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.531
Five were killed.

12:22.116 --> 12:27.413
And then he engaged
in an extended fire fight with Dallas PD,

12:27.955 --> 12:33.502
and the Dallas chief took
the steps necessary to end it

12:34.253 --> 12:37.798
by asking the bomb squad
to build a device,

12:37.882 --> 12:40.050
strapped it to a bomb robot,

12:40.134 --> 12:43.971
drove it up into the parking ramp,
and blew him the fuck up.

12:49.268 --> 12:54.064
We have talked about this stuff
happening across the country,

12:54.857 --> 12:58.986
and it is continuing
and it is picking up speed.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.909
I've directed the sergeants to go,

13:04.992 --> 13:07.036
as much as they can,

13:07.119 --> 13:10.289
with anyone tonight
who is going on a call by themselves.

13:10.372 --> 13:14.293
So you will see the sergeants
and myself creeping around,

13:14.376 --> 13:16.837
and I promise you, if something jumps off,

13:16.921 --> 13:19.590
your supervisors
are gonna be sitting just as dirty

13:19.673 --> 13:22.343
and just as hurt, or not hurt, as you are.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.929
Because that's the only way
that this is gonna fly.

13:25.846 --> 13:26.847
OK?

13:28.516 --> 13:31.560
Ninety-nine percent of the folks in Flint
want us out there.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.187
Be out there for them.

13:33.270 --> 13:36.732
The one percent that doesn't, do your job.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.152
Questions, comments, concerns?

13:41.695 --> 13:42.863
Have a good shift.

13:50.746 --> 13:53.374
The current climate...

13:54.625 --> 13:57.628
for police work is... scary.

13:57.711 --> 13:58.796
It's intimidating.

13:58.879 --> 14:02.132
It makes a lot more officers
scared to go out

14:02.216 --> 14:05.427
and basically do their jobs
the way they're supposed to.

14:10.307 --> 14:14.019
The potential danger
has always been there.

14:14.103 --> 14:18.148
We've always been a target to people
that want to target you.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.776
There's just a lot more people
that target you, now.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.820
The target is anybody in a blue uniform.

14:22.903 --> 14:26.198
It's unbelievable. Unbelievable.

14:26.282 --> 14:30.786
You try to serve and protect the people,
and people are shooting and killing you.

is the cop who tried to get him, you know?

14:46.385 --> 14:49.680
And the bad guy juked him at that post,

14:49.763 --> 14:52.600
and came around behind him
and shot him, done, right there.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.691
[Robert] <i>That guy right there</i>

15:00.774 --> 15:03.861
<i>That's why that officer ran up,</i>
<i>and did what he did.</i>

15:03.944 --> 15:06.530
He died trying to stop him.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.825
And he just killed him
like he was nothing.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.368
Fuck that guy.

15:13.495 --> 15:16.290
There's no helping somebody like that.
You've got to put them down.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.336
In truth, I didn't see the news in Dallas.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.130

[Dan Patrick] <i>These officers last night...</i>

15:29.803 --> 15:31.305

<i>And I do blame people on social media,</i>
<i>with their hatred towards police.</i>

Too many general public who aren't
criminals, but have a big mouth,

like we saw last night.

15:43.275 --> 15:47.613
Do you believe the group,
Black Lives Matter, is a fuse lighter

15:47.696 --> 15:50.950
in the assassinations
of these police officers?

15:53.619 --> 15:58.499

15:58.582 --> 16:00.918
[interviewee]
<i>We had Donald Trump's statement.</i>

16:01.001 --> 16:02.753
This is what Black Lives Matter say.

16:02.836 --> 16:06.465
They said, "Black activists have
raised a call for an end to violence,

16:06.548 --> 16:07.925
not an escalation of it."

16:09.635 --> 16:14.264

16:15.307 --> 16:17.059

-Hands up!

This anti-cop sentiment

16:28.320 --> 16:32.282
from this hateful ideology called
"Black Lives Matter"

16:32.366 --> 16:35.911
has fueled this rage
against the American police officer.

16:35.995 --> 16:40.332
It's almost like they're trying to relate
the Black Lives Matter movement

16:40.749 --> 16:42.084
with the police killings,

16:42.167 --> 16:45.379
and I hate that because
it's really overshadowing...

16:45.921 --> 16:48.924
the real issue,

16:49.675 --> 16:51.010
that...

16:51.719 --> 16:54.221
somehow there has to be some change

16:54.304 --> 16:58.726
in the way that we police
black and brown communities.

[John] We got one in custody,

<i>The Genesee County prosecutors</i>
<i>would like to keep it that way.</i>

23:02.589 --> 23:06.468
We believe that the amount
of escalating violence at the premises

23:06.551 --> 23:09.930
is such that you must seriously consider

23:10.931 --> 23:12.265
closing this store down.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.813
-[judge] <i>Mr. Isaac.</i>
<i>-</i> [Roger Isaac] <i>Thank you, Your Honor.</i>

23:17.896 --> 23:20.690
[Isaac] I understand the prosecutor says
this is a nuisance,

23:20.774 --> 23:22.692
and they want to close the store down,

23:22.776 --> 23:26.863
but their basis of nuisance, Your Honor,
is from outside activity,

23:26.947 --> 23:29.157
which the police force
should take care of.

23:29.241 --> 23:32.285
But the police force
is sometimes 15 - 20 minutes late

23:32.369 --> 23:33.370
to come to the location.

23:33.995 --> 23:36.248
Judge, my position is the same.

23:36.331 --> 23:39.292
We are seeking a closure of the store.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.213
There have been
a series of three shootings,

23:43.296 --> 23:46.675
most recently at the end of July,
beginning of August,

23:46.758 --> 23:50.929
and past shootings going back
at least to 2014.

23:51.012 --> 23:55.642
I doubt the governmental entity is willing
to pay the store owner to remain shut.

23:55.725 --> 23:56.935
Is that correct?

23:57.018 --> 23:59.938
They're supposed to go out of business
and lose their income?

24:00.522 --> 24:02.858
I'm judging it's not of their own making.

24:03.733 --> 24:06.987
[Isaac] Mr. Phelps,
do you frequent Liquor Plus?

24:07.070 --> 24:09.573
I do, four or five times a week.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.533
I do most of my shopping there.

24:12.242 --> 24:14.578
-Do you walk?
-I have to walk, yes.

24:14.661 --> 24:16.788
-No transportation?
-No transportation.

24:17.122 --> 24:20.000
[Isaac] If Liquor Plus was shut down,

24:20.375 --> 24:23.003
where would you have to go, then,
to get your product?

24:23.086 --> 24:25.463
There wouldn't be any place in the area.

24:25.547 --> 24:29.634
I've heard testimony about the D and H
and about the Hinky Dinky.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.012
I have been to both stores.

24:32.095 --> 24:34.514
They do not provide
the variety that I need.

24:34.598 --> 24:37.559
Hinky Dinky was basically
out of the price range,

24:37.642 --> 24:40.270
way too expensive
for me to be able to shop there,

24:40.979 --> 24:44.065
and I don't shop at D and H because...

24:44.858 --> 24:46.109
D and H...

24:46.610 --> 24:51.198
The neighborhood refers
to the D and the H in "D and H"

24:51.281 --> 24:53.200
as "Death and Homicide."

24:53.283 --> 24:54.659
So I don't go to that store.

24:55.243 --> 24:59.289
I think it would be a community tragedy
for them to close this store down.

25:00.665 --> 25:03.043
I have no further questions.
Thank you, sir.

25:05.712 --> 25:09.549
[McComb] What time, ordinarily,
do you shop at Liquor Plus?

25:09.633 --> 25:13.178
[Phelps] I usually go morning hours,
before work.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.478
[Keith] <i>Their argument?</i>
<i>It's happening everywhere.</i>

25:21.561 --> 25:24.356
<i>And how is the store owner,</i>
<i>you know, responsible?</i>

25:24.981 --> 25:27.150
Fuck all that.
It doesn't happen everywhere.

25:27.234 --> 25:30.654
And there's a reason
it doesn't happen on the north side

25:30.737 --> 25:33.198
or going north of Hinky Dinky.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.535
<i>In my opinion,</i>
<i>I think it has to do with race.</i>

25:37.619 --> 25:39.537
<i>I think it has to do with economics.</i>

25:40.747 --> 25:41.873
Where there's poor...

25:42.415 --> 25:43.959
whether it's black or brown people,

25:44.042 --> 25:46.795
you get liquor store, liquor store,
liquor store...

25:48.296 --> 25:51.675
Let's be clear, if this was
an all-white neighborhood,

25:51.758 --> 25:54.052
it wouldn't even be an issue,
or even happen.

25:54.511 --> 25:56.012
Wouldn't even happen.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.556
You know what I mean? So why is that?

25:58.640 --> 26:01.184
Why is it different
here in the black community,

26:01.268 --> 26:02.894
with poor black people?

26:04.312 --> 26:05.605
What's up with that?

26:07.107 --> 26:10.402
Even if this store remains open,
we're absolutely sending a message,

26:10.485 --> 26:13.363
so, in my opinion, I think
that would be a successful cause.

26:13.822 --> 26:17.993
All the rest of the stores in the city
know that there's officers out here,

26:18.076 --> 26:20.161
that's not just
fucking humping radio calls,

26:20.245 --> 26:23.707
but we're gonna address your ass,
some kind of way.

26:25.375 --> 26:28.169
It's a crime area
that we targeted with the team.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.463
Fucking deal with it. This is part of it.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.734
<i>And actually, since they've been open</i>

27:32.817 --> 27:34.778

27:35.945 --> 27:39.783
So the Crime Area Target Team out there,
they're doing an excellent job,

27:39.866 --> 27:42.535
and that's working well for the city.

27:42.619 --> 27:45.580

We're gonna keep it up.

[Bridgette] Stupid. Is it true
he's been stealing the pizzas, too?

28:31.292 --> 28:33.253
[officer] Yeah, he got
like $66 worth of pizza,

28:33.336 --> 28:36.840

enough change to break a 100."

<i>but then it was rescinded,</i>

29:06.494 --> 29:09.664
<i>so I was put in the C.A.T.T. Squad.</i>

29:11.332 --> 29:15.211
<i>I come in just as a backup,</i>
<i>and I'll fill in occasionally.</i>

29:22.594 --> 29:27.098
<i>C.A.T.T. Squad is unique. I had never</i>
<i>experienced anything like that.</i>

29:28.141 --> 29:31.811
<i>It was hard street work.</i>

29:32.145 --> 29:34.522
<i>You know, you're dealing with...</i>

29:35.190 --> 29:37.442
<i>guns and drugs all the time.</i>

29:37.942 --> 29:39.527
[dispatcher speaking indistinctly]

29:39.611 --> 29:41.446
[knocking on door]

29:43.406 --> 29:44.741
[child speaking indistinctly]

29:44.824 --> 29:47.035
-[Esther] Yeah, come to the door.
-Come here, buddy.

29:52.332 --> 29:53.625
[Esther] Come to the door.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.126
[officer] There you go.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.505
[officer #2] You're with your brother?
What's his name?

29:58.963 --> 30:00.715
[boy speaking indistinctly]

30:02.133 --> 30:03.593
[officer #2] His brother's there.

30:04.177 --> 30:07.639
[Bridgette] <i> So, I got exposure to that.</i>
<i>I didn't like it.</i>

30:07.722 --> 30:09.265
<i>I have a lot of respect for them.</i>

30:09.349 --> 30:13.436
<i>They're very necessary in our city,</i>
<i>in our department.</i>

30:13.520 --> 30:14.521
[handcuffs fastening]

30:16.022 --> 30:18.650
[Bridgette] <i>I know if I have to do it,</i>
<i>I'll do it,</i>

30:18.733 --> 30:22.946
<i>but it's just not something</i>
<i>that I would want to do all the time,</i>

30:23.029 --> 30:25.657
<i>because to me,</i>
<i>the stress level, you know...</i>

30:25.740 --> 30:29.494
<i>If you're doing raids twice a week,</i>
<i>that's not something I want to do.</i>

30:36.251 --> 30:39.337
[Bridgette] <i>So I applied to the FBI.</i>

30:41.589 --> 30:43.800
I did it without even asking.

30:43.883 --> 30:47.011
Because I'm not one to ask permission,
which is kind of bad.

30:47.095 --> 30:52.725
But I did it because, you know,
it's what I want to do. It's my dream.

30:53.351 --> 30:54.853
And...

30:55.603 --> 30:59.607
I did this... it wasn't really a fight,
because we don't fight, but...

31:02.235 --> 31:04.237
You know, he...

31:05.321 --> 31:08.741
He said he won't move with me.
He won't go with me. He can't.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.535
I mean, his kids are here.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.496
But I'm not gonna, like...

31:14.581 --> 31:16.165
put my dreams on hold,

31:16.249 --> 31:19.460
or, like, not do
what I want to do because...

31:20.670 --> 31:23.715
of, you know, his life, which is...

31:24.257 --> 31:26.426
It's so fucked up. It's so messed up.

31:31.431 --> 31:33.808
So, that happened.
We've been dealing with that.

31:33.892 --> 31:37.186
It's been, like, going on,
you know, and...

31:38.605 --> 31:40.356
now this, with his mom...

31:43.693 --> 31:45.194
[Robert] Oopsie.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.697
Let's start off with a traffic stop.

31:50.408 --> 31:51.743
<i>It happened pretty quick.</i>

31:53.202 --> 31:54.996
<i>I'm about to leave for work,</i>

31:55.079 --> 31:58.625
<i>and then I get a phone call that says,</i>
<i>"Hey, your mom's in the hospital."</i>

32:00.627 --> 32:02.211
<i>And she was sick.</i>

32:02.879 --> 32:04.088
<i>Sick, sick.</i>

32:05.548 --> 32:08.468
<i>From the time she went to the hospital</i>
<i>to the time that she died</i>

32:08.551 --> 32:10.094
<i>was only a few days.</i>

32:11.262 --> 32:13.514
<i>[dispatcher over radio]</i>
<i>OK. Are we clear on that?</i>

32:14.891 --> 32:16.851
Two-ten traffic stop, Grand and Miller.

32:16.935 --> 32:20.438
David, Edward, X-ray, one, one, two, two.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.360
[Robert] You didn't make
that light back there.

32:25.818 --> 32:28.738
It was green for me
when you were coming off of Hammerberg.

32:30.239 --> 32:32.367
[driver] The light was yellow
when I went through.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.912
[Robert] There can only be one light
at a time and it was green for me.

32:38.247 --> 32:40.917
<i>Doing a bunch of stuff</i>
<i>that I don't know how to do,</i>

32:41.751 --> 32:43.419
<i>as far as, like, arrangements,</i>

32:43.503 --> 32:47.048
<i>to also having to deal</i>
<i>with the fact that I'm doing it.</i>

32:47.757 --> 32:50.051
<i>My mind was going</i>
<i>a hundred different places,</i>

32:50.134 --> 32:52.971
<i>and I was sad, stressed...</i>

32:53.930 --> 32:57.850
<i>But unfortunately, I had to go to work.</i>
<i>I can't just not go to work.</i>

32:57.934 --> 32:59.727
[Robert]
You got a warrant for your arrest.

32:59.811 --> 33:00.687
[driver] For what?

33:00.770 --> 33:03.064
Fishing in a no-fishing area,
believe it or not.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.233
-[Driver] Really?
-Yeah. Come on out.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.610
[Robert] Put your hands behind your back.

33:07.694 --> 33:11.322
<i>You go out on a call and they don't know</i>
<i>where you are, mentally.</i>

33:11.906 --> 33:14.158
<i>All they see is a uniform or a badge,</i>

33:14.242 --> 33:16.995
<i>and they expect</i>
<i>you're gonna fix their problem.</i>

33:17.078 --> 33:19.372
[driver] I've been calling them
for over a year on that.

33:19.455 --> 33:20.456
Yeah.

33:26.921 --> 33:31.551
[Robert] <i>Bridgette wouldn't let me go</i>
<i>too far down the drain, you know?</i>

33:33.845 --> 33:35.847
<i>But I leaned on her hard.</i>

33:47.191 --> 33:49.777
[Obama] <i>I know that Americans</i>
<i>are struggling right now</i>

33:49.861 --> 33:52.155
<i>with what we've witnessed</i>
<i>over the past week.</i>

33:53.990 --> 33:56.659
<i>All of it's left us wounded,</i>

33:57.160 --> 34:00.163
<i>and angry, and hurt.</i>

34:02.373 --> 34:07.628
We wonder if an African American community
that feels unfairly targeted by police,

34:07.712 --> 34:12.091
and police departments that feel
unfairly maligned for doing their jobs,

34:12.175 --> 34:14.594
can ever understand
each other's experience.

34:17.138 --> 34:18.306
<i>We see all this,</i>

34:18.389 --> 34:23.268
<i>and it's hard not to think sometimes</i>
<i>that the center won't hold</i>

34:24.187 --> 34:25.938
<i>and that things might get worse.</i>

34:27.106 --> 34:28.440
<i>I understand.</i>

34:30.568 --> 34:32.652
<i>I understand how Americans are feeling.</i>

34:43.790 --> 34:46.333
A concerned citizen shared,

34:46.708 --> 34:49.378
through social media
with the Police Department,

34:49.462 --> 34:54.675
an individual who is trying to organize
actions against the police here in Flint.

34:55.092 --> 34:58.846
Reading it verbatim, "Black America
will take matters into their own hands

34:58.930 --> 35:01.432
by killing cops, both good and bad.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.143
Black Americans are tired
of the injustice.

35:04.227 --> 35:07.814
There will be a movie about this
coming soon. Just watch what I'm saying."

35:09.190 --> 35:11.859
You see Sergeant Suttles and I,

35:12.610 --> 35:15.113
and probably Urkel
and a bunch of other guys...

35:15.196 --> 35:17.782
When we walk out of here,
we have a bag on our back.

35:18.199 --> 35:21.619
We've had discussions that
that bag is designed to make sure

35:21.702 --> 35:25.498
that we are pretty much self-sufficient
for about six hours if things happened.

35:26.415 --> 35:28.543
You need to have extra ammunition.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.545
You need to have your trauma kit.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.922
You need to have water.
You need to have food.

35:33.005 --> 35:36.592
Because you don't know if that is
or is not going to happen tonight,

35:36.676 --> 35:38.719
and you may or may not be in a position

35:38.803 --> 35:41.305
where you're sitting in a bush
for the next six hours.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.892
If you don't have it, get it.

35:45.935 --> 35:47.228
Alright, be safe.

36:06.289 --> 36:10.084
[Devon] <i>A lot of agencies</i>
<i>wouldn't let their officers</i>

36:10.168 --> 36:11.836
<i>do it the way we're doing it.</i>

36:13.546 --> 36:15.756
<i>There's just not enough of us.</i>

36:16.340 --> 36:19.802
<i>We're going to calls by ourselves,</i>

36:20.469 --> 36:24.599
<i>that we have, from a safety standpoint,</i>
<i>no business going to.</i>

36:26.809 --> 36:29.228
<i>And we do the best that we can</i>
<i>with what we've got.</i>

36:32.148 --> 36:34.358
[Dion] <i>Even though</i>
<i>it didn't happen in Flint,</i>

36:35.610 --> 36:38.362
<i>the Dallas shooting could happen</i>
<i>at any time, anywhere.</i>

36:38.988 --> 36:42.158
I feel like every time there's a shooting,
Dion works that night,

36:42.241 --> 36:46.078
so right when he's leaving the house,
I'm like, "I love you, be safe."

36:46.162 --> 36:48.956
I'm texting him every couple hours,
"I love you, be safe."

36:49.040 --> 36:51.417
[Dion] Police, police. Anybody home?

36:53.002 --> 36:57.548
[Kellie] <i>I always have a weird...</i>
<i>like a pit in my stomach.</i>

36:58.674 --> 37:01.302
No matter what,
I cannot get it out of my head.

37:01.385 --> 37:04.931
Every time I say goodbye,
I think of the worst.

37:05.014 --> 37:08.517
Whether it's morning, night,
while you're sleeping,

37:08.601 --> 37:11.187
when you get up for your coffee,
it never stops.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.522
Like, I get a lump in my throat.

37:13.606 --> 37:16.192
I choke that down, and just shake it off,

37:16.275 --> 37:19.111
and then you kind of try
to "out of sight, out of mind" it.

37:19.570 --> 37:23.699
You always feel as though
you have to be on alert.

37:23.783 --> 37:27.370
You never know who might see you
that may know him.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.581
Being out with our daughter

37:30.665 --> 37:34.335
and running into someone
that he, you know, arrested,

37:34.752 --> 37:36.796
or had a bad encounter with...

37:36.879 --> 37:38.297
That scares me.

37:38.381 --> 37:41.759
At any other job, you can die at work,
but our job, you...

37:42.468 --> 37:44.428
can get murdered while you're at work.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.013
That's the scary part.

37:47.807 --> 37:51.227
<i>He's terrified about what I'm doing,</i>
<i>and I'm terrified about what he's doing.</i>

37:54.689 --> 37:58.859
[Robert] <i>There's cops getting killed</i>
<i>outside homes or sitting in their car.</i>

37:58.943 --> 38:01.070
<i>It's not even like we're getting a call.</i>

38:01.529 --> 38:04.615
<i>Like, "There's a guy here with a gun.</i>
<i>He said he's gonna kill the police."</i>

38:04.699 --> 38:06.325
<i>Alright. I'm ready to go.</i>

38:06.409 --> 38:09.370
<i>I got my rifle, I got my shield,</i>
<i>I've got my tactics.</i>

38:09.453 --> 38:11.038
<i>I'm coming in from the right way.</i>

38:11.122 --> 38:15.960
<i>This is, you're sitting behind a K-Mart</i>
<i>trying to eat a sandwich for 30 seconds,</i>

38:16.043 --> 38:19.714
<i>and there's this asshole hiding in a bush</i>
<i>that knows you sat there last night,</i>

38:19.797 --> 38:22.550
<i>and he's coming up with an AK47</i>
<i>and blowing your head off.</i>

38:23.634 --> 38:26.262
<i>For no reason other than</i>
<i>you're just a cop.</i>

38:27.096 --> 38:30.474
<i>I'm not just gonna stand and wait</i>
<i>for the next guy to come and shoot me.</i>

38:30.558 --> 38:34.020
Obviously, I'm gonna be on a higher alert.

38:34.103 --> 38:36.063
I'm gonna be more prone
to pull my gun out.

38:37.523 --> 38:40.484
<i>They're demanding that the police</i>
<i>become less militarized,</i>

38:40.568 --> 38:45.740
<i>but at the same time, they're forcing</i>
<i>the police to become more militarized,</i>

38:45.823 --> 38:47.783
<i>so that they can do</i>
<i>what they're supposed to do,</i>

38:47.867 --> 38:50.411
<i>which is protect society.</i>

[siren wailing]

39:08.095 --> 39:09.430
Hang on.

39:21.442 --> 39:22.943

39:23.027 --> 39:26.030
-[man] Nobody's got no gun.
-[man #2] I don't understand this shit.

39:26.113 --> 39:28.616
[man] But I just want to make sure
I'm gonna corroborate.

39:29.325 --> 39:32.661
[Robert] You could be in handcuffs
right now, so shut your mouth.

39:36.624 --> 39:37.541
[Robert] Hey.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.543
-[man] Hey, hey.
-[Robert] Back up, please.

39:39.627 --> 39:42.463
-[Robert] No need to run your mouth.
-[woman] Shut up. Be quiet.

39:42.546 --> 39:45.299
[woman] No, be quiet. Just be quiet.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.426
[Robert] You're gonna end up in handcuffs.

39:47.510 --> 39:51.347
-[man] Why am I under arrest?
-[woman] Be quiet, please, for me.

39:51.430 --> 39:55.184
-[Robert] It's being investigated.
-[woman] I don't play with the police.

39:55.267 --> 39:57.353
-[man #2] Can I ask a question?
-[Robert] Go ahead.

39:57.436 --> 40:00.815
[man #2] Why are we being questioned?
This guy's talking about a gun.

40:00.898 --> 40:03.067
[Robert] I don't know.
I'm just backing them up.

40:03.150 --> 40:07.446
Alright, so as a citizen, you guys
have no rights to sit there and say...

40:07.530 --> 40:10.074
[all shouting]

40:10.157 --> 40:12.076
[Robert] Do you want to talk to me,
or yell?

40:12.159 --> 40:14.912
-[man #2] I'm talking to you.
-[Robert] Bring it down just a little.

40:14.995 --> 40:17.706
-[Robert] You want to talk, I'll talk.
-[man #2] What's going on?

40:19.750 --> 40:22.545
[man #2] Come here, Officer Frost.
Tell me what's going on.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.172
What I'm trying to do...

40:26.006 --> 40:29.427
These guys put out that there was
a guy with a gun in a red car.

40:29.510 --> 40:33.431
-That's why I got here.
-We just came out of the club.

40:33.514 --> 40:34.682
But I get here,

40:34.765 --> 40:38.561
I see him pissing on the wall,
and he starts opening his mouth, OK?

40:38.644 --> 40:41.981
So he could automatically be arrested
for a felony if I wanted to.

40:42.064 --> 40:44.275
And then you come and start yelling, too.

40:44.358 --> 40:47.528
-We just, as you rolled up...
-You guys get into it with anybody?

40:47.611 --> 40:49.572
No, we just came out of the club.

40:49.655 --> 40:52.032
I mean before that, tonight sometime?

40:52.116 --> 40:54.452
Somebody could have been
messing with you.

40:54.535 --> 40:58.873
I had an argument with the guy in
the red hoodie, but it wasn't like that.

40:58.956 --> 41:01.375
Is it plausible
that someone could have said,

41:01.459 --> 41:04.044
"He's got a gun,"
just to get our attention on you?

41:04.128 --> 41:08.257
We were in front of everybody.
All the security guards that was out here.

41:08.340 --> 41:09.717
We didn't have anything.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.302
Him.

41:11.385 --> 41:16.056

42:03.479 --> 42:07.233
<i>I mean, when the tragedy hits</i>
<i>and that person's there for you,</i>

42:07.316 --> 42:11.237
<i>you know, and you would never expect</i>
<i>anybody to be there for you.</i>

42:27.002 --> 42:31.924
[chattering]

42:33.634 --> 42:38.847
[Robert] <i>One thing that happened at</i>
<i>the time Bridgette and I got together was,</i>

42:38.931 --> 42:41.767
<i>I made a decision in my life</i>
<i>that I was tired of being unhappy.</i>

42:42.601 --> 42:44.562
<i>I wasn't enjoying myself, or life.</i>

42:49.984 --> 42:52.361
[Robert] <i>And I found Bridgette.</i>

42:53.404 --> 42:54.822
<i>She's amazing.</i>

42:56.448 --> 42:59.410
<i>She makes me happy.</i>
<i>We make each other happy.</i>

43:01.370 --> 43:05.541
-He was robbing them from his apartment!
-He would just walk out and rob them!

43:05.624 --> 43:09.211
He would order pizza to his apartment
and they would deliver it.

43:09.712 --> 43:12.464
We're standing at the window
and he's on the couch.

43:12.548 --> 43:14.758
Like, "Hey, it's the cops.
Come to the door."

43:14.842 --> 43:16.844
He gets up and comes to the door!

43:16.927 --> 43:19.138
[laughter]

43:19.221 --> 43:23.934
[soft ambient music playing]

43:36.739 --> 43:40.701
[Bridgette] <i>The thing with the FBI,</i>
<i>it would be me moving away.</i>

43:45.205 --> 43:49.084
<i>He supports me</i>
<i>and he would support me if I wanted to go.</i>

43:54.381 --> 43:58.177
<i>You know, I have the ability</i>
<i>to go wherever. I'm not tied down.</i>

43:58.260 --> 44:00.304
<i>And he just can't do that.</i>

44:02.598 --> 44:05.017
<i>It would be a test of our relationship.</i>
