WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:03.157
Everything we did
was what they wanted.

00:03.600 --> 00:05.910
<i>I'm a prisoner,
just like before.</i>

00:06.000 --> 00:07.195
I'm going after Whiterose.

00:07.280 --> 00:08.919
I'm in.
Give me your phone.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.038
<i>I rigged Signal's API
so we could share locations.</i>

00:12.120 --> 00:13.120
You fucked me! I lost

00:13.240 --> 00:14.754
everything because of you.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.799
<i>My son's taken to Denmark,
and my wife's dead!</i>

00:17.880 --> 00:19.553
<i>The Dark Army
are just hackers.</i>

00:19.640 --> 00:21.056
<i>He turned
the gun on himself.</i>

00:21.080 --> 00:22.434
<i>He erased his history.</i>

00:22.520 --> 00:24.159
<i>You work for
the Dark Army now.</i>

00:24.240 --> 00:27.039
<i>My whole life
is ruined because of you.</i>

00:27.120 --> 00:30.511
<i>Olivia Cortez, she's
the Deus Group's only US account manager.</i>

00:30.600 --> 00:31.750
<i>She's our way in.</i>

00:31.840 --> 00:34.355
<i>You wanted to work with me,
this is the way it is.</i>

00:34.440 --> 00:36.830
If there's a problem,
don't be here when I get back.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.355
I'm resigning
as CEO of E Corp.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.672
Call Mr. Wellick and offer him
the CEO position.

00:42.760 --> 00:45.798
That van's been following us
since we got off the subway.

00:47.080 --> 00:50.039
Elliot, we're on the inside.
It's time to take them down.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.760
<i>Elliot. I've come
with the news we've been waiting for.</i>

00:57.800 --> 01:00.190
<i>They want to make me
CEO of E Corp.</i>

01:01.680 --> 01:04.878
<i>Are you hearing me? The offer came
directly from Whiterose.</i>

01:05.000 --> 01:06.673
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:07.920 --> 01:10.196
<i>This is exactly
what we've been waiting for.</i>

01:10.280 --> 01:12.556
<i>We're on the inside.
It's time to take them down.</i>

01:17.480 --> 01:20.439
<i>Sorry, I've been under
a lot of stress.</i>

01:21.120 --> 01:22.634
<i>I didn't mean to snap.</i>

01:22.720 --> 01:24.837
<i>No, uh, I get it.</i>

01:26.320 --> 01:28.960
<i>It's okay. Uh...
Here, have a seat.</i>

01:29.480 --> 01:31.358
<i>Well, you want water
or something?</i>

01:32.560 --> 01:33.755
<i>Let me get you a glass.</i>

01:36.960 --> 01:38.030
<i>There you go.</i>

01:40.480 --> 01:43.154
<i>I'm gonna boot up my computer.
It'll just take a minute.</i>

01:44.440 --> 01:48.480
<i>Fuck. I forgot the install this morning.
Looks like it failed.</i>

01:48.560 --> 01:49.596
<i>I wonder why.</i>

01:53.880 --> 01:55.837
<i>Logs say
"out of disk space."</i>

01:56.480 --> 01:57.800
<i>Just give me a second.</i>

01:59.400 --> 02:01.198
<i>I need to adjust
the swap partitions.</i>

02:04.680 --> 02:05.830
<i>That should fix it.</i>

02:07.680 --> 02:09.990
<i>"Boot device not found." Shit.</i>

02:10.639 --> 02:11.835
<i>Now my terminal's frozen.</i>

02:47.680 --> 02:48.680
Fuck.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.194
Get in, check the logs.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.751
If the recording wasn't sent back
to Dark Army, wipe everything

02:53.840 --> 02:55.832
and make sure they
can't track the van.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.910
What about him?

03:01.080 --> 03:02.196
He's dead.

03:32.680 --> 03:36.879
To be clear, I am not calling you
because we are good.

03:38.480 --> 03:43.271
I am calling because I got into
Olivia's Cyprus National Bank Account.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.716
Unfortunately,
her access isn't good enough.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.678
I can see
all the Deus account numbers,

03:48.760 --> 03:51.673
but she's not authorized
to transfer anything.

03:51.760 --> 03:55.754
I got lateral access inside
the bank's system, but hit a wall.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.395
All their authentication
goes through a proxy,

03:58.480 --> 04:01.757
and everything else
on their domain is read-only,

04:01.840 --> 04:03.832
which means

04:03.920 --> 04:07.391
we are gonna have to break into
Virtual Realty and get on their servers.

04:07.800 --> 04:11.271
Since the Deus Group meeting is tomorrow,
I'm scouting the place now.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.991
Security is lax with Christmas,
so we need to do it ASAP.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.154
Also, can't help
but wonder

04:20.279 --> 04:25.196
why exactly the fuck you are not
answering my calls!

04:25.880 --> 04:29.920
We were supposed to meet at Allsafe,
or did you forget again?

04:30.040 --> 04:31.076
Dick.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.715
Okay, you know what?

04:35.200 --> 04:38.159
I'm coming to your apartment,
and when I get there,

04:38.240 --> 04:40.391
I expect you to have
heard this message

04:40.480 --> 04:43.200
and already be prepping
for Virtual Realty.

04:43.280 --> 04:47.797
Oh. And when you do get this voicemail,
keep this in mind.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.200
Fuck you!

04:49.280 --> 04:52.512
You are a fucking
selfish dickhead of an asshole

04:52.600 --> 04:56.640
who is the shittiest brother
on Earth!

04:56.720 --> 04:59.554
I don't wanna say I hate you,
but I hate you.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.394
I hate you
so fucking much.

05:02.480 --> 05:03.994
If I show up
at your apartment

05:04.080 --> 05:07.710
and you're hanging from the goddamn ceiling
by a rope, that's cool.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.395
In fact, that would be
my preference.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.439
So in sum,
fuck off and die!

05:15.680 --> 05:18.320
<i>To continue
your recording, press two.</i>

05:18.400 --> 05:20.551
<i>To delete your recording,
press three.</i>

05:25.080 --> 05:27.959
<i>Please re-record your message
after the tone.</i>

05:29.960 --> 05:33.556
Hey, Elliot, it's me.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.075
Elliot?

07:58.920 --> 08:01.456
Okay, it looks like
the logs were never sent.

08:01.480 --> 08:05.440
So, all we gotta do is get rid of the body
and the van, and we're good to go, okay?

08:17.360 --> 08:19.317
I'm gonna go pick us up
a couple of snow shovels.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.119
We're not here
for shovels.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.236
What are we here for?

08:24.320 --> 08:26.755
Go inside, pay for the gas,
and grab a lighter.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.913
Oh. Internet's down.
No Ecoin.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.395
$19.86.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.954
Do I know you?

08:49.400 --> 08:50.516
I don't think so.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.114
You look awfully familiar.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.192
Yeah, sorry,
we're kind of in a hurry.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.233
You sure
we haven't met before?

09:03.360 --> 09:05.317
Yeah, you must have me
mistaken for someone else.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.669
You an actor?

09:06.760 --> 09:08.080
Can you just
ring him up?

09:08.160 --> 09:10.356
Wait, were you
on <i>Big Brother?</i>

09:12.600 --> 09:14.751
Yeah, that must be it.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.480
I knew it.
I never forget a face.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.309
Keep the change.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.194
Merry Christmas!

09:33.960 --> 09:35.280
Where'd you move
the van to?

09:36.240 --> 09:37.435
I didn't
move the van.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.480
Hey, hey,
what are you doing?

10:06.800 --> 10:07.800
Hey!

10:08.400 --> 10:10.039
Hey, thief!

10:10.120 --> 10:12.840
- Thief, I've called the police.
- Shit.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.376
Hey, dude, you're straight up
trying to steal my car.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.040
It's cool, man. It's cool.
You don't need to call the cops, okay?

10:17.120 --> 10:19.112
- I'm walking away.
- No, hold on.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.955
You trying to steal my car
and walk away. What's up?

10:23.600 --> 10:26.638
Dude, do you really want to deal
with the hassle of calling the cops?

10:26.720 --> 10:29.096
It's just gonna end in an all-nighter
for you at the station,

10:29.120 --> 10:30.634
followed by a shit ton
of paperwork.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.837
Besides, nothing...
Nothing happened.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.712
You busted me, I'm walking away.
No harm, no foul.

10:37.800 --> 10:41.191
Yeah, but I got questions
that need answering.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.758
First, have you
seen my keys?

10:48.080 --> 10:49.150
No.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.752
That was
my only question.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.835
Can I please go now?

10:55.920 --> 10:57.877
Oh, wait, I got
another question.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.474
Can you start my car?

11:02.800 --> 11:03.950
Really?

11:04.040 --> 11:07.511
Yeah, I usually use my keys,
and I can't seem to find them.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.559
Okay, you're not really planning
on driving like this, are you?

11:10.640 --> 11:12.199
Well, I gotta get home.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.792
Dude, you are
drunk as shit.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.520
Can't you just call a cab
or something?

11:18.600 --> 11:21.320
No, cabs don't go
where I'm headed.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.235
- Where is that, the North Pole?
- No.

11:25.320 --> 11:27.835
It's upstate. Foxrock.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.075
- What's your name?
- Tobias.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.560
Hi, Tobias.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.279
I'm Darlene.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.510
We're friends, right?

11:43.840 --> 11:45.433
Yeah, I'd like that.

11:45.520 --> 11:46.590
Great.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.800
So, here's an idea.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.155
I'll drive you home

11:50.240 --> 11:53.278
if I can borrow your car afterwards
for a quick errand.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.312
- You drive a hard bargain, Dolly.
- Darlene.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.790
Exactly.
Let's ride!

12:06.440 --> 12:11.037
Oh, guys, I understand,
but like I said, Internet's down.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.713
Phone's hooked
to the Internet,

12:12.800 --> 12:15.235
so that means
phone's down, too.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.391
We're kind of in the middle
of nowhere here.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.040
None of our phones
have service.

12:19.360 --> 12:22.353
There's gotta be someplace
nearby with cell reception.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.160
- Sure, back in town.
- What town?

12:25.800 --> 12:27.154
Pike's Hollow.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.833
How do we get there?

12:28.920 --> 12:31.674
It's too far to walk
unless you take the shortcut.

12:32.680 --> 12:37.436
But, my husband's coming to pick me up
in a bit, if you want a ride.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.670
Where's the shortcut?

12:43.640 --> 12:44.676
Got it!

12:45.360 --> 12:48.990
Tyrell Wellick, right?
That's how I know you.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.431
But I never knew
you were on <i>Big Brother.</i>

12:54.120 --> 12:59.434
Holy smokes! I cannot believe
you are in my store.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.430
- Can I get a selfie?
- No, I'm not him.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.715
You have me confused.
Okay?

13:03.800 --> 13:05.280
The shortcut,
how do we get there?

13:05.360 --> 13:07.829
Are you sure you're
not Tyrell Wellick?

13:07.920 --> 13:11.038
E Corp fella. You are
the spitting image of him.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.520
Yes, I'm sure.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.640
Well, that's too bad.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.272
Sure like to
meet him one day.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.839
Seems like a nice guy.

13:21.920 --> 13:25.800
Jesus fucking Christ, woman!
Where is the shortcut?

13:25.880 --> 13:27.394
How the fuck
do we get to town?

13:30.240 --> 13:32.880
Whoa!
Aren't you friggin' rude?

13:38.400 --> 13:41.757
Directly across the street,
you'll see an opening to a trail,

13:41.880 --> 13:44.554
and that will take you through
the woods for a stretch,

13:44.640 --> 13:47.314
but be sure you veer left
at the creek.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.757
You'll find yourself in Pike's Hollow
in 30 minutes or so.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.280
Fucking finally.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.672
Wouldn't hurt you to
learn some manners

13:58.760 --> 14:00.114
on the walk.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.096
This is
the right trail, right?

16:12.120 --> 16:13.713
The one across
from the gas station?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.275
There was only one.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.511
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

16:28.640 --> 16:29.994
So quiet out here.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.919
Have you ever
considered leaving?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.270
What do you mean?

16:43.200 --> 16:46.318
Just walking off,
disappearing,

16:47.480 --> 16:49.472
leaving the life you're living
behind you,

16:49.560 --> 16:52.758
all the bullshit, the stress,
the pain, everything?

16:53.640 --> 16:55.120
You know,
maybe start over

16:56.320 --> 16:58.516
where no one knows you
and reinvent yourself

16:58.600 --> 17:01.399
and forget about all the mistakes
you made in this life.

17:02.880 --> 17:03.950
Find some peace.

17:05.319 --> 17:06.356
Some rest.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.914
I think about that.

17:11.119 --> 17:12.156
Don't you?

17:14.280 --> 17:15.349
No.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.594
Any sign of the creek?

17:23.240 --> 17:25.152
Well, maybe it's
still up ahead.

17:27.160 --> 17:28.310
Ah.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.120
We've been walking
for a while.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.317
We should've
come across it by now.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.676
How do you know if we should've
come across it by now?

17:35.760 --> 17:38.480
Because we've been walking
for fucking hours. That's how!

17:38.560 --> 17:41.280
Don't get mad at me. I don't know
where the goddamn creek is.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.536
You were the one
who took off this way.

17:42.560 --> 17:43.560
Unbelievable.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.279
You're blaming me
that we're lost?

17:45.360 --> 17:47.431
I blame you that
we're even here.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.239
- You said he was dead.
- He was.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.834
Then how did he
drive the van?

17:51.920 --> 17:55.231
- I don't fucking know!
- All right, all right.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.549
Let's all calm down.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.676
Take it easy.

18:07.760 --> 18:08.760
What was that?

18:10.160 --> 18:11.160
A dog?

18:15.920 --> 18:16.920
Who knows?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.040
We're in the middle of the woods.
Could be anything.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.350
Maybe a coyote.

18:20.960 --> 18:21.996
Or a wolf.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.474
That.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.390
You hear it?

18:31.600 --> 18:34.479
Let's just keep going.
Maybe the creek is up ahead.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.800
She knew my face.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.276
What?

18:51.160 --> 18:52.389
The cashier.

18:53.480 --> 18:54.516
She knew my face.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.796
So what?

18:58.720 --> 19:00.439
That means
she can ID me.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.515
<i>You search,
you find, all is well.</i>

19:09.480 --> 19:11.472
<i>But what if you search
and you don't find?</i>

19:12.120 --> 19:13.395
<i>How long do you look?</i>

19:16.640 --> 19:18.836
<i>Eventually, you've gotta
give up, right?</i>

19:19.360 --> 19:20.396
<i>Then what?</i>

19:21.120 --> 19:24.272
<i>That thing you were searching for,
what becomes of it?</i>

19:25.080 --> 19:26.753
<i>How could you ever know?</i>

19:40.320 --> 19:41.595
Big night tonight?

19:44.600 --> 19:45.600
Oh.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.195
No. I'm not the real Santa.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.350
Yeah.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.675
Sometimes I wish I were.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.397
Sometimes I wish
I were...

20:05.160 --> 20:06.674
Where'd you
go there, Tobias?

20:08.080 --> 20:09.560
Uh... Just thinking.

20:10.960 --> 20:11.960
Jimmy.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.555
Good guy.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.757
Fell on
some tough times.

20:18.600 --> 20:24.358
You know how sometimes the world
just seems like it's kicking you down

20:24.440 --> 20:25.794
and you can't get up?

20:27.000 --> 20:28.434
Christ, do I ever.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.160
That's Jimmy.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.039
And you know how it is.

20:33.840 --> 20:39.677
Soon you're out in the cold winter night,
asking a lot of questions,

20:39.800 --> 20:41.473
looking at the world,

20:41.560 --> 20:46.430
thinking about what it might be like
without you in it.

21:09.760 --> 21:10.955
Do you have to do that?

21:14.280 --> 21:16.112
- It's a Christmas song.
- It's annoying.

21:24.600 --> 21:25.716
I just got it.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.080
Why you wear that hoodie.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.838
I've never seen you
in anything else.

21:32.760 --> 21:37.710
Black hoodie, black jeans,
black shoes, always the same.

21:38.080 --> 21:41.437
I've been wondering this whole time,
but now I finally get it.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.470
You don't care.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.674
Sure, why not?

21:48.840 --> 21:52.800
Silk tie, $6,000 suit.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.600
I mean, it sounds pathetic
to say aloud, but...

22:00.880 --> 22:02.155
I actually care.

22:04.640 --> 22:05.640
And you know what?

22:07.480 --> 22:08.800
That's why I'm a failure.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.869
My entire life,
I've been an outsider,

22:13.920 --> 22:18.551
worried what other people think of me,
how I can make them happy,

22:19.680 --> 22:22.479
because I needed their approval
and their acceptance.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.309
But you never cared.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.469
The first day we met,

22:31.960 --> 22:36.637
there we were, Allsafe's most important
clients roaming through the office,

22:36.720 --> 22:38.712
and you couldn't care less.

22:47.480 --> 22:48.960
We're gonna die out here.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.713
Maybe not tonight,
but soon.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.639
The Dark Army soldier,

22:55.680 --> 22:57.592
he's likely reported
back by now.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.716
It's only a matter of time
before they find us.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.596
Did you hear that?

23:14.720 --> 23:18.191
If there's traffic,
we gotta be close to town.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.310
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

23:42.040 --> 23:43.040
Hey!

23:47.840 --> 23:49.399
Jesus Christ!

24:02.640 --> 24:03.915
So, what's with
the getup?

24:04.520 --> 24:07.194
Mall Santa?
Salvation Army?

24:08.960 --> 24:10.758
Sloan Kettering.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.717
It's a cancer center.

24:14.200 --> 24:15.998
I do it for the kids.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.837
Dude, that's dope.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.317
You're definitely
a better person than me.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.911
So what,
the kids served spiked nog?

24:28.240 --> 24:32.314
No, me and some of
the other volunteers,

24:32.400 --> 24:36.952
we got a little tradition
after visiting the hospital.

24:37.760 --> 24:38.876
What's that?

24:39.600 --> 24:40.716
We get drunk.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.432
Nice tradition,
I guess.

24:45.920 --> 24:51.439
Yeah, you know the kids,
they love when we drop by.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.233
So many smiling faces.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.632
This might be the last time
I do it, though.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.516
You know the thing
that really gets you?

25:06.880 --> 25:09.918
Some of them
are so small.

25:14.200 --> 25:18.877
It's almost as if
they were just born to die.

25:21.400 --> 25:22.675
Jesus.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.519
No wonder
you're plastered.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.837
And how else do you
get through that?

25:31.320 --> 25:35.792
Well, it was easier
when my wife went with me.

25:35.880 --> 25:40.318
But, since the accident...

25:52.400 --> 25:53.834
What do you
got there, Tobias?

25:54.400 --> 25:55.400
Oh...

25:55.880 --> 26:00.193
I like to keep a nip or two on me
during the holidays.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.239
I'm not talking
about the booze.

26:03.040 --> 26:04.040
Oh.

26:04.520 --> 26:05.749
Percocet.

26:11.680 --> 26:15.754
Sometimes the pain's
just too much.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.598
Alexa, play
"slow jams" playlist.

26:23.680 --> 26:25.353
<i>Playing "slowjams"
playlist.</i>

26:26.720 --> 26:28.074
This is
my apartment.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.832
You know,
when we were chatting,

26:35.920 --> 26:39.118
I just imagined this
super organized.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.656
Well, I actually did
clean up earlier.

26:42.680 --> 26:44.876
No, I like it.

26:49.320 --> 26:50.549
You want a drink?

26:55.480 --> 26:57.756
I have one Tecate.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.110
We can share.

27:17.520 --> 27:21.560
So, my apartment being organized was
part of your fantasy in our chat?

27:21.640 --> 27:22.960
Well, you know...

27:23.840 --> 27:25.638
Just visualizing.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.117
I guess that's the thing
about IRC.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.591
Everyone gets to imagine
exactly what they want.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.030
Is that why you do it?

27:42.680 --> 27:44.592
I like how I can
control everything.

27:53.680 --> 27:57.594
I have this fantasy that I'm the only person
from IRC you've ever invited over.

28:03.840 --> 28:04.910
You are.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.874
Just...
Let me just...

28:41.480 --> 28:42.675
I'll be right back.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.030
Okay.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.352
Stop fighting so hard.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.672
You're gonna lose control
faster that way.

29:31.840 --> 29:32.876
Give into it.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.279
Give up control.

29:38.440 --> 29:43.276
You realize you'll
never be free.

30:49.680 --> 30:50.750
Um...

30:52.160 --> 30:53.879
Tobias?

30:55.040 --> 30:56.076
What's up?

31:00.080 --> 31:01.309
Hold on now.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.754
Whose car is that?

31:05.120 --> 31:07.032
That was gonna be
my question.

31:07.920 --> 31:11.675
Hey. That's my car.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.831
Oh, I get it now.

31:18.240 --> 31:21.074
Oh, you see,
I didn't drive today.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.189
Kenny drove.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.591
- He picked me up at...
- Okay, Tobias.

31:27.440 --> 31:30.956
If that is your car,
whose car is this?

31:32.480 --> 31:34.517
I have no clue.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.395
Christmas, huh?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.070
Oh.

31:44.280 --> 31:45.509
Goodbye, Tobias.

31:46.840 --> 31:50.993
Goodbye is short and final.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.791
Hey. Hey.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.869
Hey. Look.

32:12.680 --> 32:16.594
I know it might not be my place,
but I wanna help you.

32:18.640 --> 32:20.518
You wanna help me?

32:20.920 --> 32:22.559
I don't want you to
hurt yourself.

32:25.800 --> 32:29.271
Holy crow, what the heck
are you talking about?

32:29.360 --> 32:31.016
What do you mean?
You're all sad and lonely

32:31.040 --> 32:33.794
going on about Jimmy,
your suicidal "friend."

32:33.880 --> 32:38.830
Jimmy Stewart. <i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>
Christmas classic.

32:38.920 --> 32:42.311
Tobias, you just
told me goodbye is final.

32:42.400 --> 32:45.871
That is Steinbeck.
He's a national treasure.

32:45.960 --> 32:48.680
- Read a book.
- Okay, what about the pills?

32:49.320 --> 32:52.711
You're drunk as shit and you have
a bottle of Percocet. Explain that.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.474
- For my wife.
- Your wife's dead.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.639
My wife is dead?

33:02.680 --> 33:04.956
Wait, you said
she had an accident.

33:07.520 --> 33:09.193
She threw her back out

33:09.280 --> 33:10.953
when we were putting

33:11.040 --> 33:13.839
the Santa on the roof
yesterday.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.911
She's in brutal pain.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.037
She can barely move.

33:19.120 --> 33:22.352
- Doc wrote a prescription...
- Okay, you fucking scared me!

33:25.920 --> 33:27.991
- Hey, Dolly.
- Darlene.

33:28.520 --> 33:30.034
Are you okay?

33:31.200 --> 33:33.112
Yeah, I'm okay.
Why wouldn't I be?

33:35.440 --> 33:37.159
You wanna talk about it?

33:38.880 --> 33:40.394
There's nothing
to talk about.

33:42.760 --> 33:43.830
You sure?

33:46.200 --> 33:47.200
Yes.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.912
All right.
Have a great night.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.670
Fine.

34:03.760 --> 34:07.276
I have lost
absolutely everyone,

34:07.360 --> 34:10.989
my boyfriend,
my best friend, my parents.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.958
The only one I have left
is my brother,

34:13.040 --> 34:17.000
who is an asshole that treats me
like absolute shit.

34:18.159 --> 34:20.231
But I'm really worried
about him right now,

34:20.320 --> 34:24.996
and it pisses me off that I'm worried
because I am always worried about him,

34:25.080 --> 34:29.279
and he flat-out told me to fuck off.
So, why do I bother?

34:31.920 --> 34:33.036
I don't know.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.396
I don't know, I'm afraid
this time it's different.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.193
I'm afraid
he might be dead.

34:48.920 --> 34:49.989
Okay.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.676
- Reception?
- No.

35:10.640 --> 35:11.710
Time.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.231
Just realizing
it's Christmas.

35:20.080 --> 35:21.878
Can't be much further.

35:21.960 --> 35:23.838
- To what?
- Town.

35:25.120 --> 35:27.760
Let's stop lying to ourselves.
We're nowhere near town.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.753
- We're completely lost.
- We just gotta keep moving.

35:30.840 --> 35:33.753
Why? Even if we magically made it
to this Pike's Hollow place,

35:33.840 --> 35:35.957
the town is gonna be swarming
with Dark Army.

35:36.040 --> 35:39.511
- We've gotta try.
- You aren't listening to me.

35:39.600 --> 35:42.513
Whatever we're walking towards,
it ends with death.

35:54.640 --> 35:55.869
What are you doing?

35:58.920 --> 36:00.274
There's a rock
in my shoe.

36:19.160 --> 36:23.040
You honestly don't care about me,
do you?

36:25.000 --> 36:26.559
What are you
talking about now?

36:26.640 --> 36:28.836
Like why do you wear
that same hoodie every day?

36:29.680 --> 36:30.750
You don't care.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.234
Did you ever
care about me?

36:35.040 --> 36:36.679
I mean, be honest,
I can take it.

36:36.760 --> 36:37.955
What is the point
of this?

36:38.040 --> 36:40.236
Just answer the question,
did you?

36:42.000 --> 36:44.016
- Tyrell, you didn't make it easy...
- Just answer the question!

36:44.040 --> 36:45.040
No!

36:53.160 --> 36:54.160
The sound of death.

36:54.800 --> 36:57.110
It's just some stupid animal.
Let's go.

36:58.680 --> 37:00.273
- Go without me.
- What?

37:00.920 --> 37:02.673
- You're giving up?
- Yeah.

37:03.840 --> 37:04.910
I think so.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.518
I can't deal with
this shit anymore.

37:25.080 --> 37:26.116
Come on.

37:28.240 --> 37:32.519
If you stay out here alone,
you can be sure it's game over.

37:33.560 --> 37:34.880
You're better than this.

37:34.960 --> 37:39.000
Yeah, maybe I was,
but not anymore.

37:39.840 --> 37:40.956
I'm going.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.189
Yeah, go, Elliot.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.359
- I will.
- Yeah, good.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.071
'Cause you don't need me.
You never needed me.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.271
- That's the truth, right?
- Yeah, that's the truth!

37:50.360 --> 37:52.397
I never fucking
needed you!

37:52.480 --> 37:54.437
You were only
in the way!

37:54.720 --> 37:55.870
If it weren't
for you...

37:56.000 --> 37:57.559
The world would've
been saved?

37:58.680 --> 38:02.560
And you would have been the savior?
Is that what you think?

38:03.120 --> 38:04.918
Is that the fantasy
I ruined for you?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.390
Stay here, die!

38:07.480 --> 38:09.995
I don't give a fuck
about you!

38:11.000 --> 38:13.151
I'm done!

38:15.000 --> 38:16.070
Good!

38:17.160 --> 38:18.594
Look around you!

38:19.200 --> 38:23.399
All signs lead to the same
hopeless destination,

38:23.480 --> 38:26.359
and the sooner you realize that,
the better,

38:26.440 --> 38:31.754
but you're so much in your own head that
you can't see the truth, that it's over!

38:34.800 --> 38:37.000
<i>Seems like we're
always thinking of ourselves</i>

38:37.040 --> 38:39.032
<i>when looking for
something that's lost.</i>

38:40.960 --> 38:43.475
<i>But we never think much
about the lost,</i>

38:44.440 --> 38:47.194
<i>whatever, whoever is
unable to be found,</i>

38:48.800 --> 38:51.838
<i>whether it's a set of keys
left somewhere and forgotten,</i>

38:53.040 --> 38:55.714
<i>a couple of guys wandering aimlessly
in the woods,</i>

38:56.720 --> 38:59.189
<i>or someone who's
disappeared inside himself.</i>

39:00.040 --> 39:02.111
<i>What if that's what they
wanted all along?</i>

39:03.160 --> 39:04.480
<i>Not to be found.</i>

39:22.920 --> 39:23.990
You're wrong.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.156
I don't like being
an outsider, either.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.873
Maybe I'm just good
at hiding it.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.191
Why'd you come back?
Why aren't you going?

39:39.080 --> 39:40.116
I don't know.

39:41.120 --> 39:44.955
I guess, it felt wrong
to leave you.

39:48.040 --> 39:54.150
Besides, I think you're the only person
I know that actually likes me.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.913
You were right
about one thing.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.072
I've known that we're gonna die
since we walked out of that gas station

40:05.160 --> 40:06.560
and the van was gone.

40:09.080 --> 40:11.390
I don't think there's a way
out of this for us.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.434
Why do you want
to keep going?

40:17.240 --> 40:18.515
My sister.

40:20.760 --> 40:24.674
I have to warn her.
I have to at least try.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.599
I got her into this mess.

40:29.520 --> 40:33.036
Same as the last time
and the time before that.

40:33.120 --> 40:37.114
I've been a horrible brother.
I treated her like shit.

40:38.880 --> 40:42.954
Least I can do is call her
and tell her to run.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.599
Maybe she can
still escape.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.636
How much longer do you think
until they find us?

41:00.000 --> 41:01.150
I don't know, man.

41:09.160 --> 41:10.310
All right.

41:13.480 --> 41:14.834
Let's keep moving.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.832
Maybe you can still
make that phone call.

41:34.720 --> 41:35.995
- Dolly.
- Darl...

41:36.920 --> 41:37.920
What?

41:38.240 --> 41:43.599
I know you're worried about your brother,
but you gotta worry about you, too.

41:47.280 --> 41:48.475
I'm trying.

41:49.440 --> 41:51.318
And I hope he's not dead.

41:53.120 --> 41:54.713
Merry Christmas.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.200
Hi.

42:02.440 --> 42:03.510
Ho, ho, ho.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.480
Santa's home.

42:50.520 --> 42:51.954
Oh.

42:56.320 --> 42:57.320
Oh, shit.

43:38.840 --> 43:39.876
Fuck!

45:12.080 --> 45:13.116
Tyrell.

45:17.800 --> 45:18.836
You okay?

45:28.600 --> 45:29.750
Oh, Jesus Christ.

45:31.120 --> 45:32.190
I'm okay.

45:35.520 --> 45:37.113
We can't just
leave him here.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.397
Gotta get you to
a hospital, man.

45:46.360 --> 45:48.556
Fuck. Fucking phone.

45:48.680 --> 45:50.319
No, no hospital.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.754
The Dark Army will find me.
They'll find you.

45:57.320 --> 46:00.199
No, no, we gotta
keep moving, man.

46:00.280 --> 46:03.000
We'll find someplace
that can help you.

46:03.080 --> 46:04.400
No, I'm done.

46:06.960 --> 46:10.032
Burn the van and
all the evidence.

46:13.760 --> 46:16.798
Make sure you take care
of Whiterose.

46:17.960 --> 46:19.076
Okay?

46:26.280 --> 46:27.280
Tyrell.

46:33.680 --> 46:35.114
I can't let you die.

46:39.200 --> 46:40.680
I'm just gonna
go for a walk.
