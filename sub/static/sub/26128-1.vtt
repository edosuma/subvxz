00:03.963 --> 00:05.381
No.

00:06.298 --> 00:07.466
No, go away.

00:07.550 --> 00:08.509
I don't have time for this,
all right?

00:08.592 --> 00:09.677
I have kids.

00:09.760 --> 00:13.055
Just watch the damn show
when you're supposed to, okay?

00:13.139 --> 00:14.515
Amy.
Amy!

00:14.598 --> 00:15.558
See?
Thanks a lot.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.143
Way to go.
Amy!

00:17.226 --> 00:18.644
Military school?

00:18.728 --> 00:20.146
You said that you
weren't going back.

00:20.229 --> 00:22.356
Why did we even bother
getting engaged?

00:23.107 --> 00:25.151
Marry me
before you leave, dumbass.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.445
<i>You love me, right? Then
what's the point in waiting?</i>

00:27.528 --> 00:29.155
Get off the bus, Carl!

00:29.238 --> 00:31.365
I love you!

00:31.449 --> 00:32.908
Saw you took
the "For Rent" sign down.

00:32.992 --> 00:34.118
It's about time I got

00:34.201 --> 00:35.745
something of my own
for a change.

00:35.828 --> 00:37.663
He come with the place too?

00:37.747 --> 00:38.789
<i>What should I say when</i>

00:38.873 --> 00:40.583
<i>I talk about you
to other people?</i>

00:40.666 --> 00:41.959
Am I your girlfriend?

00:42.043 --> 00:43.669
Are you a homosexual, Ian?

00:43.753 --> 00:44.837
Any of you queers
sick of this bullshit

00:44.920 --> 00:46.088
and want to get out of here?

00:46.172 --> 00:47.548
<i>It's on YouTube.</i>

00:47.631 --> 00:48.466
It's already got,
like, 1,000 hits.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.759
Seriously?

00:49.842 --> 00:50.843
<i>He's like a prophet.</i>

00:50.926 --> 00:52.178
<i>And he's super hot too.</i>

00:52.261 --> 00:53.637
Like hot gay Jesus.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.972
So big,

00:55.056 --> 00:57.266
and we do it in God's name.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.771
<i>My god's a faggot,
a junkie,</i>

01:01.854 --> 01:02.813
a whore!

01:07.068 --> 01:08.152
Is he off his meds?

01:08.235 --> 01:09.904
How the hell would I know?

01:09.987 --> 01:11.197
Everyone up!

01:11.280 --> 01:12.698
<i>I need sheets.</i>

01:12.782 --> 01:16.077
<i>I need lots
and lots of sheets.</i>

01:18.662 --> 01:20.247
Debbie!

01:20.331 --> 01:21.916
Well, what would
the surgery cost?

01:21.999 --> 01:24.001
<i>It'll run you
at least $50,000.</i>

01:24.085 --> 01:25.628
<i>I was hoping there was
something I could do to help.</i>

01:25.711 --> 01:27.213
<i>We don't have
enough fathers</i>

01:27.296 --> 01:29.048
<i>- on our PTA.
- Sign me up.</i>

01:29.131 --> 01:30.633
Pimp my ass.

01:30.716 --> 01:32.259
Now tell me how much
you made last year.

01:32.343 --> 01:33.594
Two grand, maybe,

01:33.677 --> 01:35.012
and I don't pay taxes.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.972
Ah!

01:37.056 --> 01:38.891
Oh, you got a niece?

01:38.974 --> 01:41.519
My sister's kid.
Xan.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.145
Any sign of Xan's mom?

01:43.229 --> 01:45.523
I'm giving my shit-bag
half sister two more days.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.566
Hey, why don't you come
stay with me for a couple days?

01:47.650 --> 01:50.444
- That'd be cool.
- Cool.

01:50.528 --> 01:53.239
Those rich, white, liberal
parents at your school,

01:53.322 --> 01:55.324
we gotta take advantage
of that.

01:55.407 --> 01:57.326
They'll be gone.
We know the code.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.744
<i>You got the code, right?</i>

02:01.747 --> 02:03.082
Fuck!

02:04.166 --> 02:06.669

next year, maggot?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.170

the general this afternoon.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.873

Only two more days

10:34.593 --> 10:36.094
There are three units
on this level

10:36.178 --> 10:38.013
and three apartments upstairs.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.265
All super-reliable tenants.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.894
I put a new roof on
last year.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.856
Uh, that was broken
when I bought the place.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.609
I've been looking
for a matching piece.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.319
That won't affect
the price, will it?

10:52.402 --> 10:54.571
Just gotta take pictures
of what I see.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.157
You must be so busy,

10:57.240 --> 10:58.742
everyone trying
to refinance

10:58.825 --> 11:00.369
before the rates
go up any more.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.204
Been doing
ten of these a day.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.664
Wow, that's a lot.

11:04.706 --> 11:07.125
Yeah. Sure.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.628
And you live around here,
in the city?

11:09.711 --> 11:11.588
Uh, Schaumburg,
actually.

11:11.672 --> 11:12.673
Oh.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.883
It is so nice out there.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.718

11:16.802 --> 11:18.762
Uh, couple times.

11:18.845 --> 11:22.432
What's the real estate like
out in, uh, Schaumburg?

11:23.141 --> 11:25.310
Nothing like what's
happening down here.

11:25.394 --> 11:26.728
You grow up there?

11:26.812 --> 11:29.106
Yeah, yeah.
Born and raised.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.273
Interesting.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.026
It...
It's not.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.862
My husband and I,
we like it, though.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.325
So what do you think
this place is worth?

11:40.409 --> 11:42.828
$550?
$600 at least, right?

11:42.911 --> 11:44.329
Gotta do the comps.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.206

13:59.005 --> 14:01.007
Hey, Frank.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.557
Push.
Push.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.392
Yo, Leo.

14:10.475 --> 14:11.768
My cell,
five minutes.

14:11.852 --> 14:12.853
No, thank you.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.856
Yes, thank you.
I need to blow a nut.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.232
I don't think so.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.569
Since when do you get
a say in this, bitch?

14:20.652 --> 14:23.697
Since I told him
that he gets a say in this,

14:23.780 --> 14:25.115
bitch.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.242
They're on strike, remember?

14:27.325 --> 14:28.869
You were serious
about our fucking hos

14:28.952 --> 14:30.203
- being on strike?
- Until you agree

14:30.287 --> 14:33.039
to mutual sexual respect,
they aren't coming back.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.499
Let's go, Leo.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.835
Release him, jack-hole!

14:47.804 --> 14:49.514
Fuck you

14:49.598 --> 14:51.182
and your ho strike.

14:54.311 --> 14:55.604
Bye, baby.

14:58.732 --> 14:59.983
You're doing the right thing,
Leo.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.611
I know, but I miss him.

15:03.653 --> 15:06.698
Strength through
collective action.

15:06.781 --> 15:07.866
It's the only way
the oppressed

15:07.949 --> 15:09.659
have ever triumphed
over the oppressors.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.370
Strength, ladies.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.247
Gallagher.

15:14.331 --> 15:15.707
Visitor.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.171
Yo, Jules, stand guard.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.089
I got it, boss.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.549
Strength.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.762
You sure it's okay
you're missing school today

15:28.845 --> 15:30.472
for Brad's wedding?

15:30.555 --> 15:31.973
Yeah, my teacher just said

15:32.057 --> 15:34.684
to bring a note
from my mom tomorrow.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.227
Need me to write it?

15:36.311 --> 15:39.064
Nah, I can forge
her signature.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.607
Okay.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.526
All right.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.820
There we go.

15:45.904 --> 15:49.282
And...
how do I look?

15:49.366 --> 15:50.659
- Stupid.
- Well, good.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.077
That's what I was going for.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.204
Come on,
before you make me late.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.335
I love yoga.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.800
Ah.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.426
What are you doing?

16:08.510 --> 16:11.554
Emergency PTA meeting.
I hope the kids are okay.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.306
We should probably
pick up the pace a little.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.766
Yeah.
Up you go.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.434
Oh, God.

16:19.813 --> 16:22.107
I'm close to getting
the bail money.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.984
The court just did
an appraisal on my building.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.111
- How soon?
- Tomorrow, maybe.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.239
I-I need a few more days.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.782
There's oppression
everywhere in here.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.659
W-what are you talking about?

16:32.742 --> 16:34.786
I'm busting my ass to get you
out of this shit hole.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.204
My work here is not done.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.416
I-I'm saving the submissives
from their sexual oppressors.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.377
And I'm getting you
a $50,000 gift of freedom.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.629
Look, I organized a strike
against the gangbangers

16:44.713 --> 16:46.715
who terrorize
the gay and trans inmates.

16:46.798 --> 16:49.092
They take out
their feelings of...

16:49.175 --> 16:50.844
inadequacy
and repressed homosexuality

16:50.927 --> 16:52.554
on us queers,

16:52.637 --> 16:55.306
and they practice
really bad sexual hygiene.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.269
A-are they giving you
your meds in there?

17:02.022 --> 17:04.024
I-I'm protecting
defenseless lambs

17:04.107 --> 17:06.026
from having their emotional
and physical spirits

17:06.109 --> 17:08.862
slaughtered, Fiona.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.705
Don't break any bones, girls.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.041
We can't afford the hospital.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.376
V, why they got
so much energy now?

17:23.460 --> 17:25.462
They were never like this
when Svetlana was here.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.546
I think
they were scared of her.

17:26.629 --> 17:27.839
Hell, I know I was.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.301
<i>Open up, Kev.
We got a line out here.</i>

17:31.384 --> 17:32.677
- Whee!
- All right, I'm coming.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.345
I'm coming.

17:34.429 --> 17:35.930
I'm coming!

17:37.557 --> 17:39.017
<i>Let's go,
while we're middle-aged!</i>

17:39.100 --> 17:40.268
Calm down!

17:40.351 --> 17:42.771
All right, girls,
just stay.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.274
- Well, about time.
- Oh, relax.

17:46.357 --> 17:47.817
There's still 19 hours
left to drink.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.235
Let's go, yeah.
Let's go.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.987
No, no, no, no, no no, no, no.
What are you--

17:51.071 --> 17:52.197
Molly, how many times
have I told you?

17:52.280 --> 17:53.865
You cannot bring dogs
in the bar.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.658
Oh, come on, Kev.
I just need a shot and a beer.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.118
I've been playing fetch
with the beasts for two hours

17:57.202 --> 17:58.828
just to tire them out.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.455
All right, fine.
Make it fast.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.957
It's just, I don't want to get
shut down by the county.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.085
Having your kids in a cage
is what's gonna get you

18:05.168 --> 18:07.712
- shut down by the county.
- That's a playpen.

18:07.796 --> 18:10.423
We don't have a sitter
with Svetlana gone.

18:10.507 --> 18:13.218
Which means we don't
have sexy time anymore.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.512
Kev, no one needs to know
about our sex life.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.721
I do.
Makes me not feel

18:16.805 --> 18:18.556
so shitty about mine.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.974
Hey, what's up, Debs?

18:20.058 --> 18:21.351
Hey.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.602
Pitcher of beer,
please.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.270
And a large Coke.

18:24.354 --> 18:25.438
What, are you guys, like,
morning drinkers now?

18:25.522 --> 18:26.523
Ha.
Your morning is our evening.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.732
Every couple weeks,

18:27.816 --> 18:28.858
we have to work
a graveyard shift.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.027
It sucks.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.862
Oh, can you cash my check
for me, V?

18:32.946 --> 18:35.323
- How much is it for?
- $720.

18:35.406 --> 18:36.658
Are you high?

18:36.741 --> 18:37.659
We don't have
that kind of money

18:37.742 --> 18:39.160
first thing in the morning.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.537
We don't have that kind
of money last thing at night.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.831
Wait, $720?

18:42.914 --> 18:44.624
What are you talking about?
We worked the exact same shifts

18:44.707 --> 18:47.252
- last week.
- Yeah, 40 hours times 18.

18:47.335 --> 18:48.837
$18?

18:48.920 --> 18:50.797
- Mm-hmm.
- An hour?

18:50.880 --> 18:52.632
I make $15.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.425
- Oh.
- Do you guys make $18 too?

18:54.509 --> 18:56.302
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.639
Fucking Jacob.

Uh, no.
They're just getting started.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.215
Oh, thank God.
I would never hear

19:34.299 --> 19:36.050
the end of it from Cami.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.260
The maid of honor?

19:37.343 --> 19:39.637
Yep.
Her sister, Tami.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.014
Cami and Tami, huh?

19:41.097 --> 19:42.849
Yeah, well, our parents,
Pami and Sami,

19:42.932 --> 19:44.976
weren't very creative.

19:45.059 --> 19:46.728
I'm fucking with you.
They're Bob and Kim.

19:46.811 --> 19:47.979
Are you the best man?

19:48.062 --> 19:49.606
Yeah, I'm Lip.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.773
What's up with your hair?
Are you, like,

19:50.857 --> 19:52.233
in the Marines or some shit?

19:52.317 --> 19:54.736
I was freebasing.
My head caught on fire.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.946
I'm fucking with you.
No, I, uh,

19:57.030 --> 19:58.573
fell asleep
with gum in my mouth.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.366
That's the most retarded thing
I've ever heard.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.743
Oh, says the lady
with the bouffant

20:01.826 --> 20:02.994
and the princess headband.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.162
I spent hours on this.

20:04.245 --> 20:05.705
Well, you can't get
that time back, can you?

20:05.788 --> 20:07.207
Oh, I can't wait

20:07.290 --> 20:08.291
till this cocksucking
ceremony is over

20:08.374 --> 20:09.375
so we can hit
the reception.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.836
I am fucking starving.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.130
- Let's do this thing!
- After you.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.223
Buzz off, will you?

20:23.306 --> 20:24.474
What are you doing here?

20:24.557 --> 20:27.018
I need you to do me a favor.
I...

20:27.101 --> 20:29.229
- Hey.
- Hi, Frank.

20:29.312 --> 20:30.521
Nice to see you again.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.357
- It's been a while.
- Yeah.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.904
Take this home with you,
will you?

20:37.987 --> 20:39.572
Hide it someplace safe.

20:39.656 --> 20:40.698
What's in it?

20:40.782 --> 20:42.784
A little weed, some blow.
A couple of oxys.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.369
There's a PTA meeting.
It's probably best

20:44.452 --> 20:46.454
not to bring that stuff
onto school grounds.

20:46.537 --> 20:49.374
Hey, would you--

20:49.457 --> 20:50.875
Doesn't sound like weed.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.252
It's my salary.

20:52.335 --> 20:55.296
Ever since you denied me
my big, fat score,

20:55.380 --> 20:57.257
I've had to make money
the good old-fashioned way:

20:57.340 --> 20:58.466
on my back,

20:58.549 --> 20:59.968
taking what scraps I can

21:00.051 --> 21:01.844
from your little friends'
parents.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.430
I'm gonna pawn that stuff
after the meeting.

21:04.514 --> 21:06.307
Yes?

21:15.191 --> 21:17.151
<i>Enter.</i>

21:22.031 --> 21:23.408
At ease, soldier.

21:23.491 --> 21:24.826
Sir, I'd like to discuss

21:24.909 --> 21:26.619
the cadet lieutenant position.

21:26.703 --> 21:28.538
I know it comes down
to me and Lawson

21:28.621 --> 21:29.872
and that one of my men

21:29.956 --> 21:31.124
is not up
to the high standards

21:31.207 --> 21:33.126
of military cadets
that we expect,

21:33.209 --> 21:35.420
but I promise you,
if given that position,

21:35.503 --> 21:36.796
I will get him there next year.

21:40.508 --> 21:43.636
What are your plans for
after graduation, Corporal?

21:43.720 --> 21:45.221
Sir?

21:45.305 --> 21:46.889
Cadet lieutenants
have traditionally

21:46.973 --> 21:48.683
gone on
to service academies.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.184
West Point?

21:50.268 --> 21:52.562
You have the discipline,
the fighting spirit.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.189
Get a congressman
or senator's recommendation.

21:55.273 --> 21:57.275
You really think I could?

21:57.358 --> 22:00.278
You'll have to handle
your personal situation.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.989
There's a civilian
outside the wire in a tent.

22:03.614 --> 22:06.200
Gallaghers have always
attracted crazy, sir.

22:06.284 --> 22:08.536
My brothers have.
Sisters too.

22:08.619 --> 22:09.954
My mother was crazy.

22:11.664 --> 22:15.209
Well, if you can straighten out
your platoon

22:15.293 --> 22:17.045
and personal issues, son,

22:17.128 --> 22:20.256
there's a good chance you'll be
cadet lieutenant next year.

22:31.184 --> 22:32.560
Costco or bust.

22:32.643 --> 22:35.396
Hey.
Let me just get my stuff.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.815
- How was Ian this time?
- Crazier than usual.

22:37.899 --> 22:39.150
Wants to stay in jail.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.610
Needs time
to negotiate a strike

22:40.693 --> 22:43.321
between the gangbangers
and the lambs.

22:43.404 --> 22:45.156
No idea
what he's talking about.

22:45.239 --> 22:46.866
That's extra-crispy crazy.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.368
Yeah.
Anyway, here.

22:48.451 --> 22:49.952
You left your coat
at my place.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.788
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.084
All right, lads. I'm off.
I'll see you later, yeah?

22:56.167 --> 22:57.835
All right, man.
See you.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.966
Yo, gay <i>Jesus!</i>

23:04.050 --> 23:06.344
You need
to release our hos now.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.514
You ready to negotiate
better conditions

23:09.597 --> 23:11.891
for these children
of our Lord?

23:12.850 --> 23:14.394
Last night,
I fucked my sink.

23:14.477 --> 23:15.770
- My balls are so blue.
- Yeah, that's right.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.522
Then shall we talk,

23:17.605 --> 23:19.690
try to agree on the proper ways
to manage our relationships

23:19.774 --> 23:22.568
with those we love
and care for?

23:22.652 --> 23:24.320
Sure.
Whatever the fuck you say,

23:24.404 --> 23:25.988
as long as I get
my ass eaten out.

23:28.533 --> 23:29.867
All right.

23:29.951 --> 23:31.577
Let's break bread
and drink wine together.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.298
I never thought
she'd stick around.

23:44.382 --> 23:46.676
Ah, well, you did the work.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.511
You know?
You faced your demons.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.179
A kid and the love
of a good woman

23:50.263 --> 23:51.556
will do that to you.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.558
Should try it sometime.

23:53.641 --> 23:54.851
- Get out here...
- Let's go!

23:54.934 --> 23:55.977
- ...and dance!
- Go get 'em.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.145
No, no, no, if I'm doing this,

23:57.228 --> 23:58.396
come on, you're coming with me.

23:58.479 --> 23:59.564
- Come on, man.
- Come on.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.232
Lip, we're doing
our nerdiest dance moves.

24:01.315 --> 24:02.316
- Yeah?
- Watch, okay.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.568
Okay.

all right.

24:14.162 --> 24:15.955
Now, uh, no matter
what dance move I do,

24:16.038 --> 24:17.081
it's gonna be
the nerdiest.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.166
- You ready?
- Yeah.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.667
Sure?
Okay.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.045
- Oh, Jesus.
- What? That's good!

24:23.129 --> 24:24.172
That's awful.

24:24.255 --> 24:25.923
- What's up?
- Nothing.

24:26.007 --> 24:27.508

24:27.592 --> 24:28.718
Okay.

24:32.472 --> 24:34.348

He has a beard.

24:34.432 --> 24:38.269
Yeah, that's what the hormones
in milk will do to you.

24:38.352 --> 24:40.813
Chillax, Grandpa.
She's having fun.

24:40.897 --> 24:42.565
Come on.

24:42.648 --> 24:43.858
Uh, where?

24:43.941 --> 24:45.026
The maid of honor
and best man

24:45.109 --> 24:47.862
always hook up at these things.

24:51.199 --> 24:52.992
<i>♪♪ Smooth like butter ♪♪</i>

24:55.036 --> 24:56.454
Good afternoon.
Thank you all

24:56.537 --> 24:58.539
for coming in
on such short notice.

24:58.623 --> 25:00.166
Earlier today,
I was contacted

25:00.249 --> 25:02.001
by the county
health department.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.170
- Lice again?
- I wish.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.589
Then what? I got
an open house in 30 minutes.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.466
There's an epidemic
at our school.

25:08.549 --> 25:10.218
- Measles?
- It's because of those

25:10.301 --> 25:13.221
anti-vaxxer French kids
you let in, isn't it?

25:13.304 --> 25:15.139
It's not the measles.

25:15.223 --> 25:18.309
We're talking about
a very...delicate issue:

25:18.392 --> 25:20.436
a sexual epidemic.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.146
In elementary school?

25:22.230 --> 25:23.773
That's the French.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.191
My kid's nine.

25:25.274 --> 25:26.734
And she's a giant slut.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.027
Honey, stop.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.320
I'm serious.
You should see

25:29.403 --> 25:31.197
what her daughter
wears out of the house.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.740
It's called style.

25:32.823 --> 25:35.117
Maybe your son
should take a few pointers.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.411
Please, enough.
I'm not talking

25:37.495 --> 25:39.247
about the children,
for God sakes.

25:39.330 --> 25:40.957
I'm talking about you people.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.585
The epidemic has been traced
to this PTA.

25:44.669 --> 25:45.836
What?

25:45.920 --> 25:47.004
I'll turn this over

25:47.088 --> 25:48.381
to Dr. Jonathan Rosenbaum

25:48.464 --> 25:50.299
from the county health board

25:50.383 --> 25:52.051
to further explain.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.844
Ah, thank you.

25:53.928 --> 25:56.889
Um, as mentioned, uh,
this is a sensitive issue,

25:56.973 --> 25:59.058
but one that we do not
take lightly.

25:59.517 --> 26:00.851
Over the past few weeks,

26:00.935 --> 26:02.395
four people
have tested positive

26:02.478 --> 26:05.314
for virulent strains
of multiple STDs.

26:05.398 --> 26:07.567
The only thing these people
have in common

26:07.650 --> 26:08.859
was this PTA group.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.319
In all my time

26:10.403 --> 26:11.904
at the county
health department,

26:11.988 --> 26:13.406
I-I've never seen symptoms

26:13.489 --> 26:15.283
of all three
venereal diseases--

26:15.366 --> 26:17.326
chlamydia, gonorrhea,
syphilis--

26:17.410 --> 26:19.036
in four people at once.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.663
Who the hell are the four?

26:20.746 --> 26:22.248
- Not me.
- Bullshit.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.083
Uh, I can't
reveal that information,

26:24.166 --> 26:26.127
but swift action
must be taken

26:26.210 --> 26:27.670
so we can learn
who these individuals

26:27.753 --> 26:28.754
came in contact with

26:28.838 --> 26:30.172
so we can contain
the epidemic.

26:30.256 --> 26:33.217
You're saying
these four people may have

26:33.301 --> 26:35.094
- given it to the rest of us?
- Yes.

26:35.177 --> 26:36.804
But that could only happen
from sex.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.764
You--you don't get an STD
from a toilet seat.

26:38.848 --> 26:40.891
This is absurd.
If you excuse me,

26:40.975 --> 26:42.351
I have a root canal
to perform.

26:42.435 --> 26:44.562
Sir, you're gonna stay
and be tested.

26:44.645 --> 26:46.439
Can't keep us here
against our will.

26:46.522 --> 26:48.274
Actually, I can.
The Illinois

26:48.357 --> 26:49.942
Sexual Transmissible Disease
Control Act

26:50.026 --> 26:51.777
states that we can order
the testing

26:51.861 --> 26:53.321
and the isolation
of an individual

26:53.404 --> 26:55.448
to stop the spread
of an STD

26:55.531 --> 26:57.366
until such time that the danger
to the public health

26:57.450 --> 26:58.868
is eliminated.
That's the law.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.911
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

27:00.995 --> 27:02.872
- Folks!
- What is going on here?

27:02.955 --> 27:05.041
As soon as everyone
is tested,

27:05.124 --> 27:06.542
we can determine
who can leave

27:07.168 --> 27:08.502
and who will need
intravenous antibiotics.

27:08.586 --> 27:09.587
Thank you.

27:09.670 --> 27:11.797
- This is--
- What the--

27:20.056 --> 27:21.682
You pay Farhad more than me.

27:21.766 --> 27:24.018
You know what, Jugs? I don't
even have you on the schedule

27:24.101 --> 27:25.645
till tomorrow morning.

27:25.728 --> 27:28.189
He gets $18 an hour.

27:28.272 --> 27:29.440
Everybody does.

27:29.523 --> 27:31.484
- I don't.
- Well, you're a girl.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.486
What does that have to do
with anything?

27:33.569 --> 27:35.404
Uh, you take
a lot of bathroom breaks--

27:35.488 --> 27:37.657
peeing, getting your period
and whatnot--and I timed you.

27:37.740 --> 27:39.241
- What?
- Twenty-four minutes

27:39.325 --> 27:41.118
in the can
during an eight-hour shift.

27:41.202 --> 27:42.328
That's because
your port-a-potties

27:42.411 --> 27:44.080
are fucking disgusting.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.331
You guys piss
all over the seats.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.958
It takes me five minutes
to clean it and build a nest

27:48.042 --> 27:49.669
before I can sit down
and pee.

27:49.752 --> 27:51.212
Way of the world, Jugs.
You don't like it,

27:51.295 --> 27:53.130
find another job.

27:58.928 --> 28:01.180
Wedding fucks are the best.

28:01.263 --> 28:03.974
- You've done this before?
- Seven times.

28:04.058 --> 28:07.478
You want my wedding pussy,
don't you?

28:07.561 --> 28:09.146
Your version of dirty talk?

28:09.230 --> 28:11.065
Why, is it working?

28:11.774 --> 28:12.942
Sure.

28:13.025 --> 28:16.570
Ah, your cock is making me
really dizzy.

28:16.654 --> 28:18.364
That a good thing?

28:18.447 --> 28:19.949
Fucking hallway's
spinning around right now.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.702
Oh, hey, you want me
to stop?

28:22.785 --> 28:24.578
- Ah...
- Fuck.

28:25.413 --> 28:26.747
Hey, are you all right?

28:26.831 --> 28:28.416
Man.

28:28.499 --> 28:29.750
I feel a lot better.

28:29.834 --> 28:32.169
Okay, yeah, let's finish
this thing.

28:32.253 --> 28:34.088
I need another drink.

28:47.309 --> 28:49.937
Whoever you four
fuckers are that are infected,

28:50.020 --> 28:53.524
I just got a foot-long Q-tip
just shoved up my dick.

28:53.607 --> 28:57.695
I understand your anger
and your frustration,

28:57.778 --> 28:59.280
and we appreciate
your cooperation.

28:59.363 --> 29:01.323
At this time,
everyone has been tested.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.160
Thank you.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.328
Uh, Donald and Eliza Watts,

29:06.412 --> 29:08.247
Paula Dowd,

29:08.330 --> 29:09.665
Leah and John Alperin,

29:09.749 --> 29:11.333
Tod Carney,

29:11.417 --> 29:13.794
Kate and Lina Thomas.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.422
You're all free to go.

29:16.505 --> 29:17.506
- Yes!
- Fuck.

29:21.844 --> 29:23.304
What about the rest of us?

29:23.387 --> 29:24.889
You all tested positive.

29:24.972 --> 29:26.557
No, that's impossible.

29:26.640 --> 29:27.892
I'm calling my lawyer.
That's ridiculous.

29:27.975 --> 29:29.185
Look, folks, we have

29:29.268 --> 29:31.103
to trace
this communicable web

29:31.187 --> 29:34.064
to see if anybody is infected
that is not in this room.

29:34.148 --> 29:35.733
Look, I can't force you

29:35.816 --> 29:37.443
to reveal
your sexual partners,

29:37.526 --> 29:40.237
but any information
you give us

29:40.321 --> 29:41.822
could very well save lives.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.998
I slept with I-Irene Bragg.

29:51.081 --> 29:52.792
Asshole!

29:52.875 --> 29:55.044
Fucking whore.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.671
Ed.

29:58.214 --> 29:59.799
Charlize Stewart.

30:01.091 --> 30:02.176
What?

30:02.259 --> 30:04.428
I slept with
my tennis pro.

30:04.512 --> 30:06.639
I slept with our nanny.

30:06.722 --> 30:09.016
I had sex
with my gynecologist.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.852
I always fantasized
about having enough money

30:11.936 --> 30:13.979
to stock up on toilet paper.

30:14.063 --> 30:15.231
Lofty goals.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.398
Hey, when I was a kid,

30:16.482 --> 30:18.567
we had to use
whatever we could find.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.653
Christmas napkins,

30:20.736 --> 30:22.404
paperbacks,

30:22.488 --> 30:23.656
coffee filters.

30:32.331 --> 30:33.332
You don't answer it?

30:33.415 --> 30:34.542
No.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.252
Got boxes to unpack.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.962
I've got a bathroom
to clean.

30:38.045 --> 30:40.297
I clean it every week.
It's not that dirty, is it?

30:40.381 --> 30:41.715
Ever look behind the toilet?

30:41.799 --> 30:43.634
No, and I never plan
on doing so.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.553
Uh-huh.

30:46.095 --> 30:49.056
The appraisal report came in.
I can get the bail money.

30:51.058 --> 30:52.643
What?

30:52.726 --> 30:54.436
Nothing.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.355
What?

30:57.523 --> 30:59.358
Better not to get involved.

30:59.441 --> 31:00.734
With me?

31:00.818 --> 31:02.361
With your family.

31:02.945 --> 31:05.197
If you're involved with me,
you're involved with my family.

31:05.281 --> 31:06.991
Let's talk about
your dirty toilet.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.243
You don't think
I should bail him out?

31:09.326 --> 31:10.661
Didn't say that.

31:10.744 --> 31:13.539
You didn't say anything.
It's like talking to a wall.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.749
"Uh, excuse me, Mr. Wall.
I just got

31:15.833 --> 31:17.334
the money to bail out
my brother.

31:17.418 --> 31:18.419
Isn't that great?"

31:18.502 --> 31:21.046
"Why, yes, Fiona.
That is fantastic!"

31:21.130 --> 31:22.923
I doubt the wall
would say that.

31:23.007 --> 31:23.924
Yeah?
Well, what would

31:24.008 --> 31:24.967
the fucking wall say, then?

31:25.050 --> 31:26.719
Ian set a--a van on fire.

31:26.802 --> 31:28.596
Coulda killed somebody.
He has a Jesus complex.

31:28.679 --> 31:29.930
You said he's on and off
his medication.

31:30.014 --> 31:32.016
So I shouldn't bail
my own brother out?

31:32.099 --> 31:33.559
What if he doesn't show up
for his trial?

31:33.642 --> 31:35.019
- He wouldn't do that.
- You sure?

31:35.102 --> 31:37.229
He knows my ass
is on the line.

31:37.313 --> 31:38.981
If he skips town,
you lose all your money.

31:39.064 --> 31:40.274
Could be put to better use.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.776
- How?
- Don't know.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.069
Invest in another
apartment building.

31:44.153 --> 31:46.655
Buy a café,
yoga studio--

31:46.739 --> 31:48.532
anything but your brother.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.288
Beverly.

31:58.417 --> 32:01.337
My gardener, Pablo.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.381
I, uh--
I don't know his last name.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.760
Uh, Kurt Alvarez.

32:09.178 --> 32:12.556
Our pool guy.
And, uh...

32:13.265 --> 32:14.808
Frank.

32:18.979 --> 32:21.065
I slept with Frank.

32:21.148 --> 32:22.816
So did I.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.445
Me too.

32:27.738 --> 32:29.782
Yep.
Frank.

32:32.785 --> 32:35.829
- I slept with Frank.
- I slept with Frank.

32:35.913 --> 32:37.706
Frank.

32:43.671 --> 32:46.090
V, look how hard I am for you.

32:46.173 --> 32:48.467
My dick is so hard,
it's holding up this--

32:48.550 --> 32:50.219
Kev!

32:50.302 --> 32:52.471
Jesus, V, you're supposed
to be putting them to bed!

32:52.554 --> 32:54.515
They won't sleep.
I'm trying to tire them out.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.433
Did you sing
that Russian lullaby to them?

32:56.517 --> 32:58.352
A thousand times,
and I read to them,

32:58.435 --> 33:00.396
and I rocked them
and I cuddled them

33:00.479 --> 33:01.480
and I threatened them.

33:01.563 --> 33:03.524
We should rub crème de menthe
in their mouths.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.317
- What?
- All my foster parents

33:05.401 --> 33:06.986
used to give us booze
for us kids to go to sleep.

33:07.069 --> 33:08.404
That's not
a great selling point.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.072
Then what are we gonna
do, then?

33:19.790 --> 33:21.333
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

33:21.417 --> 33:22.501
What are you doing?

33:22.584 --> 33:23.794
We're gonna go play fetch.

33:23.877 --> 33:25.337
It worked for that
dog-walking lady.

33:25.421 --> 33:27.047
Maybe it'll work

Frank stole

from my friends' moms.

34:45.918 --> 34:47.294
They know about it?

34:47.377 --> 34:48.545
I don't think so.

34:48.629 --> 34:50.547
Ah, you should pawn it, then.

34:51.507 --> 34:52.758
Gonna give it back.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.218
What, to Frank?

34:54.301 --> 34:55.886
To my friends.

34:55.969 --> 34:57.763
How are you even a Gallagher?

34:58.222 --> 34:59.681
Hey, uh, dinner's ready!

34:59.765 --> 35:01.391
Be there in a sec.

35:01.475 --> 35:02.768
Why, what are you doing?

35:03.185 --> 35:04.728
My boss said I pee too much.

35:04.812 --> 35:06.480
That's why I get paid
less than the guys.

35:06.563 --> 35:08.357
So tomorrow, I'm not
going to pee at all.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.692
Get paid less
just for showing us that.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.569
Screw him.
Like guys don't piss.

35:12.653 --> 35:14.863
It's total discrimination.

35:14.947 --> 35:16.740
Hey, I come bearing gifts.

35:16.824 --> 35:19.618
Oh, uh, Debs won't need any.

35:19.701 --> 35:20.869
What is that?

35:20.953 --> 35:22.830
It's best not to ask.

35:23.497 --> 35:24.832
So...

35:25.499 --> 35:27.126
I can get Ian's bail money.

35:27.209 --> 35:28.377
That's great.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.087
Yeah.

35:30.170 --> 35:31.547
You guys don't think he would

35:31.630 --> 35:33.590
skip out on me, do you?

35:34.049 --> 35:35.092
Is he taking his meds?

35:35.175 --> 35:36.385
Maybe not.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.929
Is he gonna be able
to get his old EMT job back,

35:39.012 --> 35:41.014
or go back to being
Gay Jesus?

35:41.098 --> 35:42.141
Beats me.

35:42.224 --> 35:43.851
Is he gonna pay back
his bail?

35:43.934 --> 35:47.688
I don't know.
Does any of that shit matter?

35:47.771 --> 35:50.399
How many times have we
bailed out family before?

Thank you all for staying.
You're all to be commended.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.332
Um, at this point,
you've all received

36:48.415 --> 36:50.083
your first IV dose
of amoxicillin.

36:50.167 --> 36:52.419

when we are trapped

37:01.929 --> 37:03.639
If you hadn't spread your legs
for half these guys,

37:03.722 --> 37:05.557
- we wouldn't be here.
- Don't blame this on me.

37:05.641 --> 37:07.351
You screwed just as many people
as I did.

37:07.434 --> 37:09.269
I don't understand
why we can't leave.

37:09.353 --> 37:10.812
It's not like we're gonna
have sex

37:10.896 --> 37:12.481
and infect the rest
of the world.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.233
You're definitely
not gonna have sex.

37:14.316 --> 37:17.152
I mean, you don't want to have
sex more than quarterly.

37:17.236 --> 37:18.528
I have post-partum!

37:18.612 --> 37:20.572
For three years?

37:20.656 --> 37:22.407
Uh, in my experience,
she's got

37:22.491 --> 37:23.659
quite an active libido,

37:23.742 --> 37:25.202
but hey, let's not fight.

37:25.285 --> 37:27.120
We gotta make the best
of this situation.

37:27.204 --> 37:29.915
The best of this situation?

37:29.998 --> 37:31.708
You fucked all of our wives,
Gallagher.

37:31.792 --> 37:34.002
Probably the reason
for this whole damn thing.

37:34.086 --> 37:35.379
Yeah.

37:35.462 --> 37:36.964
Yeah, let's kill him.

37:37.047 --> 37:38.382
- Yeah.
- Oh, will you--

37:38.465 --> 37:39.967
- Would you calm down?
- Stop.

37:40.050 --> 37:41.134
Careful.
Stop it.

37:41.218 --> 37:42.261
Look at the bright side!

37:42.344 --> 37:43.553
We're getting
free medical care.

37:43.637 --> 37:44.638
Free medical care!

37:44.721 --> 37:46.348
You destroyed my marriage.

37:46.431 --> 37:49.059
I did you a favor!

37:49.142 --> 37:52.229
My penis might have actually
helped you to heal.

37:52.312 --> 37:53.730
Did you ever think of that?

37:53.814 --> 37:55.440
The hell
are you talking about?

37:55.524 --> 37:57.359
Your bodies
are developing immunity

37:57.442 --> 38:00.028
to a horrible disease
thanks to me!

38:00.112 --> 38:01.697
Three horrible diseases.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.031
The fact that
you're all cheating

38:03.115 --> 38:04.449
is a lot more serious

38:04.533 --> 38:06.326
than a couple of silly

38:06.410 --> 38:08.495
sexually transmitted diseases.

38:08.578 --> 38:09.830
I think you should use
this time

38:09.913 --> 38:11.540
to reexamine
your relationships.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.208
There's nothing wrong
with our relationships.

38:13.292 --> 38:14.835
Is that what you think,
Charlize?

38:14.918 --> 38:17.462
Because you told me
you feel sexually invisible

38:17.546 --> 38:18.547
in front of Wells.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.840
What?
That's bullshit.

38:19.923 --> 38:21.258
She said you don't find her
attractive

38:21.341 --> 38:22.843
since she had your child.

38:22.926 --> 38:24.678
You saw the baby
come out of that thing,

38:24.761 --> 38:26.346
and it grossed you out.

38:26.430 --> 38:27.848
You gotta get over it, man.

38:27.931 --> 38:28.849
Who the hell are you,

38:28.932 --> 38:30.434
to tell us what to do?

38:30.517 --> 38:33.520
I'm the guy who supplied
your wives a service.

38:33.603 --> 38:35.022
That's who.

38:35.105 --> 38:38.317
You men have been
neglecting them.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.651
Been off screwing other women

38:39.735 --> 38:41.403
because it's more exciting,

38:41.486 --> 38:42.738
but you have not put the time

38:42.821 --> 38:44.114
into your marriages,

38:44.197 --> 38:45.991
so I've had to do the work.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.702
Thank God I'm great at sex.

38:48.785 --> 38:51.163
It's probably 'cause
I've had a lot of practice.

38:51.246 --> 38:52.414
A lotta practice.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.708
Lotta, lotta, lotta practice.

38:54.791 --> 38:56.209
I'm gonna kill him.

38:56.293 --> 38:57.794

38:57.878 --> 38:59.254
Will you--

39:01.757 --> 39:04.343

kill the bastard!

39:04.426 --> 39:05.886

39:05.969 --> 39:07.262

39:08.597 --> 39:10.432
Look, Frank might have a point.

39:14.978 --> 39:16.605
- He does?
- Yeah!

39:16.688 --> 39:18.023
Listen to Darren.

39:19.441 --> 39:21.693
The truth is,

39:21.777 --> 39:23.653
Sasha,

39:23.737 --> 39:25.947
I've been working too much,

39:26.490 --> 39:30.118
and I haven't--haven't been
a very good husband,

39:30.202 --> 39:32.120
or a very good father,

39:32.204 --> 39:33.580
and maybe we could just,

39:33.663 --> 39:35.415
you know,

39:35.499 --> 39:36.958
go somewhere and--

39:37.042 --> 39:39.086
and talk about it.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.255
- Fine.
- Yeah?

39:42.339 --> 39:44.466
Did you see that,
people?

39:44.549 --> 39:47.803
The flame of love, relit
right in front of your eyes.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.471
Does anyone else
want to talk,

39:49.554 --> 39:51.348
try to come up
with a solution?

39:51.431 --> 39:52.974
I don't.
Irene can

39:53.058 --> 39:54.142
rot in hell,

39:54.226 --> 39:56.061
You'll be right there
next to me.

39:56.770 --> 39:59.231
Well, maybe some people need
a little longer to process.

39:59.689 --> 40:01.274
Len,

40:01.358 --> 40:03.318
we haven't had sex
in ages.

40:03.402 --> 40:05.570
Honey, let's not air out
our laundry here.

40:05.654 --> 40:08.573
Len, please, let her--
let her continue.

40:09.658 --> 40:12.452

with every woman in here,

40:12.536 --> 40:13.829
yet you tested positive.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.039
That doesn't make sense to me,
Len.

40:16.123 --> 40:17.999

40:18.083 --> 40:19.459

40:33.557 --> 40:34.724
Okay.

40:35.434 --> 40:36.643

43:31.443 --> 43:33.570
I got
a broken cam bearing.

43:33.653 --> 43:35.280
Grab that flashlight.
Help me take a look.

43:35.363 --> 43:37.324
Yeah, sure, sure.

43:37.407 --> 43:38.867
You're in a good mood.

43:38.950 --> 43:40.535
I'm fucking married.

43:40.619 --> 43:42.829
That was the best day
of my life.

43:42.912 --> 43:45.707
Uh, yeah.

43:45.790 --> 43:47.125
Yeah, looks like
the breather gear

43:47.208 --> 43:48.209
took out the cam.

43:48.293 --> 43:50.837
Eh.
Valves are bent too.

43:50.920 --> 43:51.921
I'm gonna write an estimate.

43:52.005 --> 43:53.173
Yeah.

43:55.884 --> 43:58.720
So you and Tami hit it off
at the wedding.

43:58.803 --> 43:59.679
Yeah, yeah.

43:59.763 --> 44:00.680
She's cute.

44:00.764 --> 44:03.433
Uh, we hooked up.

44:03.516 --> 44:05.101
She was drunk.
Puked on me.

44:06.394 --> 44:07.854
Sober sex is weird, huh?

44:08.438 --> 44:09.814
Take her out
on a real date.

44:09.898 --> 44:11.900
Go out for a steak
or something.

44:11.983 --> 44:14.319
There's nothing like
a good woman to ground you.

44:14.986 --> 44:17.864
She could be the one.
You never know.

44:17.947 --> 44:20.033
Nah, no, I think I'm too busy
for anything like that.

44:20.116 --> 44:21.701
Yeah, because you spend
all your time

44:21.785 --> 44:23.620
hanging out
with that ten-year-old girl.

44:23.703 --> 44:24.704
It's getting
kind of skeevy, man.

44:24.788 --> 44:25.914
Hey.

44:26.498 --> 44:28.291
She doesn't have
anybody else.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.379

46:03.219 --> 46:04.763
I've got to get them
back to their owners

46:04.846 --> 46:06.473
at some point, you guys.

46:07.390 --> 46:10.143
Uh, Molly,
just ten more minutes, please.

46:10.226 --> 46:11.895

Yeah, it's--it's, uh--
it's Lip.

47:04.155 --> 47:05.615
You know,
from the wedding thing.

47:05.698 --> 47:07.283
Oh, yeah.

47:07.367 --> 47:09.202
'Sup?

47:09.285 --> 47:12.789
Brad told me you worked here.
It's nice.

47:12.872 --> 47:14.249
Okay.

47:14.958 --> 47:17.961
Um...
Um...

47:18.044 --> 47:20.630
Look, I thought maybe
you'd want to, uh,

47:20.713 --> 47:22.090
um, go out to dinner,

47:22.173 --> 47:23.341
or something.

47:23.424 --> 47:25.260
Oh, nah.
I'm good.

47:27.262 --> 47:28.847
You're--you're what?

47:28.930 --> 47:30.473
Look,

47:30.557 --> 47:33.560
I'm sure in some circles,
you're badass,

47:33.643 --> 47:35.353
or not.
I don't know.

47:35.436 --> 47:36.896
You're just...

47:36.980 --> 47:38.857
really not that much fun.

47:38.940 --> 47:40.483
You don't drink,

47:40.567 --> 47:42.694
you're all angsty
about some little girl,

47:42.777 --> 47:44.654
and you fuck for shit.

47:45.488 --> 47:47.198
Uh, I don't fuck for shit.

47:47.282 --> 47:50.034
Oh, yeah, no,
you fuck for shit.

47:50.118 --> 47:52.745
Hey, fuck you,
I fuck for shit.

47:52.829 --> 47:54.789
Have you ever been
on the receiving end

47:54.873 --> 47:56.207
of your fucking?
No.

47:56.291 --> 47:57.292
So how would you even know

47:57.375 --> 47:58.960
if you fuck for shit?
You wouldn't.

47:59.043 --> 48:00.420
Yeah, well, it's a little
difficult

48:00.503 --> 48:01.504
to not fuck for shit

48:01.588 --> 48:03.006
when you're standing
in a puddle of vomit,

48:03.089 --> 48:04.507
you know, fucking
some gargantuan woman

48:04.591 --> 48:05.592
in a closet.

48:06.050 --> 48:07.427
Whatever you need
to tell yourself

48:07.510 --> 48:09.095
- to sleep at night.
- No, I'm sorry

48:09.178 --> 48:11.264
if I wasn't as good
as the 73 other best men

48:11.347 --> 48:12.807
you've had sex with,
all right?

48:12.891 --> 48:13.975
Oh, you weren't.

48:14.058 --> 48:15.310
No, not by a long shot.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.020
That was probably
the worst lay

48:17.103 --> 48:18.479
- I've ever had.
- Jesus.

48:18.563 --> 48:20.732
You were all like,
jab, jab, jab.

48:20.815 --> 48:22.442
- Jab, jab, jab, jab, jab, jab!
- You know, I didn't even want

48:22.525 --> 48:23.776
to ask you out to dinner,
all right?

48:23.860 --> 48:25.028
Brad made me do it.

48:25.111 --> 48:26.738
I was just trying
to be a nice guy.

48:26.821 --> 48:28.489
Nice guy?
Okay, well, then you

48:28.573 --> 48:30.241
should've fucked me
good and hard,

48:30.325 --> 48:32.368
'cause that would've been
a nice guy.

48:32.452 --> 48:33.828
You know, have a good life,
pukey.

48:33.912 --> 48:36.331
Yeah, see you later,
jabby.

48:43.212 --> 48:44.589
Hey, Nick!

48:44.672 --> 48:46.591
You going
to the port-a-potty again?

48:46.674 --> 48:49.135
Third time
in the bathroom today?

48:49.218 --> 48:50.553
Whoo!
What's that,

48:50.637 --> 48:53.306
about 12, 13 minutes, Jacob?

48:54.140 --> 48:56.059
What's the deal
with you, Gallagher?

48:56.142 --> 48:58.227
You haven't taken
a pee break all day.

48:58.311 --> 48:59.395
Shit, you're right.

48:59.479 --> 49:00.980
Thanks for reminding me.

49:01.064 --> 49:03.066
Gonna go right now.

49:10.531 --> 49:12.033
All done.

49:26.547 --> 49:27.840
Hi.

49:28.383 --> 49:29.759
Whatcha doing?

49:30.343 --> 49:32.804
Signing the loan paperwork
to get Ian's bail money,

49:32.887 --> 49:34.639
and I don't want to hear
a word about it.

49:34.722 --> 49:36.099
Not from me.

49:36.182 --> 49:37.892
I come bearing burritos.

49:39.060 --> 49:40.645
Chicken and bean?

49:40.728 --> 49:42.105
Is that what you like?

49:42.188 --> 49:43.314
Yes.

49:43.398 --> 49:45.066
Then of course
that's what I got.

49:51.614 --> 49:53.032
Thank you.

49:53.366 --> 49:54.742
I will--

49:54.826 --> 49:57.453
I will accept
this apology burrito.

49:57.537 --> 49:59.288
- Apology?
- Yeah.

49:59.372 --> 50:00.540
For keeping it a secret
you got two phones.

50:00.623 --> 50:02.750
Oh, and here I thought
you were gonna apologize

50:02.834 --> 50:03.876
for snooping through my phones.

50:03.960 --> 50:05.920
Yeah, no, not a chance.

50:11.592 --> 50:14.220
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

50:14.303 --> 50:15.805
Did you talk to my mother?

50:15.888 --> 50:17.223
Nope, never rang.

50:17.306 --> 50:19.058
I did drop it
in the toilet, though.

50:19.142 --> 50:20.685
I hope it still works.

50:24.272 --> 50:26.107
Mmm.

50:30.111 --> 50:31.863
Took care of your problem,
Corporal Gallagher.

50:31.946 --> 50:32.989
What problem is that?

50:33.072 --> 50:35.450
Just wanted to prove
my loyalty to our platoon, sir.

50:35.533 --> 50:37.201
The hell are you talking about,
cadet?

50:37.285 --> 50:39.245
Kassidi.
Don't worry, sir.

50:39.328 --> 50:41.289
Nobody will ever
find the body.

51:04.437 --> 51:05.813
I have good news.

51:05.897 --> 51:08.232
Me too.
I can get the bail money.

51:08.316 --> 51:09.358
Our strike ended.

51:09.442 --> 51:10.860
We were able to negotiate

51:10.943 --> 51:12.862
peaceable and non-abusive
engagements.

51:12.945 --> 51:14.030
Did you hear what I said?

51:14.113 --> 51:15.364
I got approval
to take a loan

51:15.448 --> 51:17.200
- against my building.
- Now, some of the bangers

51:17.283 --> 51:18.451
are slow to pick up

51:18.534 --> 51:19.786
on what that actually means,
but, you know,

51:19.869 --> 51:20.870
with the upbringing
they've had,

51:20.953 --> 51:22.455
I'm not surprised.

51:22.538 --> 51:24.082
Listen, if I bail you out,
are you gonna show up

51:24.165 --> 51:25.917
for your trial?

51:26.375 --> 51:29.837
I-I have no idea where Shim's
gonna take me, Fiona.

51:29.921 --> 51:30.797
Who?

51:30.880 --> 51:32.090
Shim.

51:32.799 --> 51:33.800
What the hell is a shim?

51:35.384 --> 51:36.552
I mean, we have no idea

51:36.636 --> 51:38.513
if God's a she or a he,
do we?

51:40.014 --> 51:41.265

52:02.370 --> 52:03.287
