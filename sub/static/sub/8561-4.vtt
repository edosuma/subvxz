02:29.219 --> 02:34.344
The Toccoa men, that's the ones that
was there at the very beginning.

02:34.558 --> 02:38.093
They are very close.

02:38.312 --> 02:42.476
They accept people coming in,
like myself, as a replacement…

02:42.692 --> 02:45.479
but you also had to prove yourself.

02:45.695 --> 02:49.907
Most of them were qualified
parachutists. They had to be.

02:50.158 --> 02:54.157
A lot of them were awfully green,
and we knew that.

02:54.371 --> 02:57.289
We hoped they could keep alive.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.991
A lot of them didn't.

03:00.920 --> 03:05.713
But after a while,
they eventually blend right in.

03:05.926 --> 03:08.595
I think maybe they were trying…

03:08.845 --> 03:14.884
to impress the older guys,
people like me or Shifty.

03:15.144 --> 03:18.181
I don't know why,
but I got to where…

03:18.439 --> 03:22.852
I didn't wanna be friendly
with replacements coming in…

03:23.111 --> 03:28.616
because, God, I didn't like seeing
them get killed. It just tore me up.

03:28.825 --> 03:33.155
We were in awe of them.
They were wearing infantry badges.

03:33.414 --> 03:36.913
They had a star on their jump wings.

03:38.753 --> 03:42.122
They were heroes to us.
That's how we saw them.

03:42.340 --> 03:45.258
And they were good. They were good.

03:45.510 --> 03:49.555
We had good officers,
but we had excellent NCOs.

03:49.807 --> 03:51.799
They looked after you.

04:15.501 --> 04:20.293
All right, now, lieutenant,
nice and easy. We still got a shot.

04:21.757 --> 04:24.878
Tough break.
You're having a tough night.

04:25.095 --> 04:27.800
–Sorry, George.
–It's all right.

04:28.474 --> 04:30.846
–Nice shot, sir.
–Thank you, Bull.

04:31.101 --> 04:33.853
–Thank you.
–Heffron, finish me up.

04:34.063 --> 04:37.812
–What does he need?
–Double seven.

04:38.735 --> 04:40.443
There it is!

04:40.654 --> 04:43.655
You're embarrassing the lieutenant.
Drink.

04:43.865 --> 04:45.525
Don't mind if I do.

04:45.742 --> 04:48.844
Better start winning money,
your pals miss you.

04:48.954 --> 04:54.495
–Yeah, they do look kind of sad.
–They're just serious fighting men.

04:54.710 --> 04:56.584
I'll introduce myself.

04:56.796 --> 05:00.415
Be careful.
Don't take much to set my guys off.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.303
You got some wild-eyed killers there.

05:03.512 --> 05:07.510
–Good thing we weren't gambling.
–We'd have gotten killed.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.174
–You wanna bet?
–A pack of smokes.

05:10.436 --> 05:12.512
–I don't know.
–Come on.

05:12.730 --> 05:15.634
–First one to hit the bull's-eye?
–One shot.

05:15.858 --> 05:18.102
–Why not? Make it two.
–Two packs.

05:18.319 --> 05:21.903
–Yeah, two packs.
–All right, two packs. One shot.

05:22.115 --> 05:25.698
Hey, fellas. What do you hear?
What do you say?

05:25.953 --> 05:29.737
–That's Babe's seat. Private Heffron's.
–Is that right?

05:29.957 --> 05:33.077
I don't care
if it's fucking Eisenhower's.

05:36.631 --> 05:40.581
–Who are you?
–Private Miller. James Miller.

05:40.802 --> 05:44.421
–I'm in Randleman's squad.
–Us too. I'm Les Hashey.

05:44.681 --> 05:46.840
–Tony—
–Garcia. I know.

05:47.059 --> 05:49.977
Old Gonorrhea don't miss nothing.

05:50.521 --> 05:53.725
Lieutenant, you gonna shoot
lefty all night?

05:53.942 --> 05:56.433
–Come on.
–Because he's right-handed.

05:56.653 --> 06:00.817
What would I do without George Luz?

06:01.658 --> 06:05.359
Goodness gracious!
Two packs, gentlemen. Pay up.

06:05.579 --> 06:10.206
–So Heffron tell you about Doris yet?
–No.

06:11.461 --> 06:14.581
Well, then I'm gonna educate you.

06:14.798 --> 06:18.333
We're ready to get on the plane
for the first jump.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.877
All of a sudden, Heffron stops.

06:21.138 --> 06:24.009
Boom. Everybody banging
into each other.

06:24.224 --> 06:28.139
Heffron's staring at the airplane's
nose, because on it…

06:28.354 --> 06:33.266
is painted this beautiful pinup.
Written underneath: “Darling Doris”.

06:33.484 --> 06:38.194
Doris just happens to be the name
of the skirt who just that day…

06:38.448 --> 06:41.900
sent Babe one of them letters.
You know them—

06:42.119 --> 06:45.037
Web, what do you call them letters?

06:45.247 --> 06:48.699
–Dear John letter.
–That's it. A “Dear Babe” letter.

06:49.460 --> 06:53.328
Anyway, lucky for Babe,
Patton overruns our drop zone.

06:53.548 --> 06:59.254
Mission canceled. Babe don't have
to risk getting inside Doris again.

07:01.557 --> 07:03.763
Bull, your squad listens good.

07:03.976 --> 07:07.926
They're being polite,
like whenever Bull opens his mouth.

07:09.023 --> 07:11.099
They're just humoring him?

07:11.317 --> 07:15.944
Yeah, like whenever he gives out
some of his folksy farm wisdom.

07:16.156 --> 07:20.284
Probably think he's a fucking hayseed.
Ain't that right?

07:21.286 --> 07:23.326
What are you laughing at?

07:31.923 --> 07:37.084
You new boys, you pay attention
to Sergeant Randleman. Got that?

07:37.304 --> 07:40.091
That's the smartest man
in the company.

07:49.859 --> 07:51.651
Where'd you get that?

07:51.861 --> 07:56.156
It's the Presidential Distinguished
Unit Citation.

07:56.366 --> 08:01.574
–For what the regiment did in Normandy.
–Right. For what the regiment did.

08:01.789 --> 08:08.587
–You weren't there.
–Ease up, Cobb. It's a unit citation.

08:45.753 --> 08:50.332
Shit, Cobb. You didn't fight
in Normandy, neither.

08:54.972 --> 08:59.349
I got hit in the plane
before I got a chance to jump.

08:59.685 --> 09:05.142
Hey, you all! Listen up!
I got us an announcement to make.

09:06.192 --> 09:09.976
–This is Carwood Lipton.
–He's already married, Smokey.

09:10.739 --> 09:15.816
This here is Carwood Lipton,
the new Easy Company first sergeant!

09:17.872 --> 09:23.542
As befitting his position, he says
he has to make an announcement.

09:24.796 --> 09:31.250
Well, I hate to break the mood here,
boys, but we're moving out again.

09:52.534 --> 09:54.741
As you can see…

09:55.162 --> 09:58.282
this is called
Operation Market Garden.

09:58.499 --> 10:02.449
For airborne divisions,
this one's bigger than Normandy.

10:02.670 --> 10:05.624
We're dropping deep
into occupied Holland.

10:05.840 --> 10:11.084
The Allied objective is to take this
road between Eindhoven and Arnhem…

10:11.305 --> 10:15.005
so the two British
armored divisions can move up it.

10:15.226 --> 10:18.809
Our job is gonna be
to liberate Eindhoven…

10:19.230 --> 10:22.979
stay there, wait for the tanks.

10:25.278 --> 10:30.984
The entire European advance has been
put on hold for this operation.

10:31.201 --> 10:34.831
It's Montgomery's plan,
we'll be under British command.

10:34.914 --> 10:40.205
The good news is, if this works, these
tanks will be heading into Germany.

10:40.420 --> 10:44.168
That could end the war
and get us home by Christmas.

10:44.382 --> 10:47.419
Intelligence doesn't expect
much opposition.

10:47.677 --> 10:51.889
They think the Krauts there
are mostly kids and old men.

10:52.099 --> 10:53.926
We should surprise them.

10:54.185 --> 10:59.061
Say goodbye to England, I don't think
they're gonna call this one off.

11:21.548 --> 11:25.131
–What are you doing?
–Look at Cobb, man.

11:26.344 --> 11:32.846
Watch and learn, kids.
You wanna live, jump ready to fight.

12:39.799 --> 12:43.133
Who let you out
of the hospital like that?

12:43.553 --> 12:46.804
They didn't let me out. I busted out.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.845
I didn't wanna get reassigned.

12:50.102 --> 12:55.228
–Can you make the jump?
–Sure I can, Lip. I just can't sit.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.726
–Welcome back, Popeye.
–Thanks.

12:57.944 --> 13:02.820
–Popeye went AWOL just in time to jump.
–What's he doing here?

13:03.075 --> 13:07.322
Who, Sobel? Well, he's the newly
appointed regimental S-4.

13:07.538 --> 13:11.073
–Supply officer?
–Yeah, you got it.

13:11.292 --> 13:14.293
He picked me up in Aldbourne.

13:14.545 --> 13:18.413
–He know you went AWOL?
–He knows.

13:18.633 --> 13:22.762
He said I was lucky.
I could sit out this jump if I wanted.

13:22.971 --> 13:26.969
–I didn't want to. So he says, “Hop in.”
–“Hop in”?

13:27.184 --> 13:31.514
Yeah, I couldn't believe it.
Maybe he'll court-martial me later.

13:31.731 --> 13:34.020
Let's get you some gear.

13:38.780 --> 13:41.984
Hey, Mal, over there.

13:43.994 --> 13:45.654
Son of a bitch.

13:52.587 --> 13:54.663
Malarkey.

13:59.678 --> 14:03.628
–Sergeant Malarkey.
–Sir.

14:08.938 --> 14:11.974
You thought you'd get away with it?

14:12.358 --> 14:14.684
What do you mean, sir?

14:19.282 --> 14:22.486
That motorcycle is U.S Army property.

14:23.078 --> 14:26.993
That may not mean anything to you,
but it does to me.

14:27.833 --> 14:29.577
Where'd you find it?

14:30.128 --> 14:32.900
–That's him, all right.
–Who is he, sarge?

14:33.089 --> 14:35.597
–He was our first C.O.
–What happened?

14:35.800 --> 14:37.461
He got promoted.

14:37.719 --> 14:40.127
Just tap my leg, sergeant.

14:40.347 --> 14:45.686
–Lieutenant, you'll be in the doorway.
–Yeah, I know. But, look, sergeant…

14:45.936 --> 14:51.477
you'll be behind me. When the green
light comes on, just tap me, all right?

14:51.693 --> 14:55.857
–The light will be next to you.
–Do it. That's an order.

14:56.615 --> 14:58.074
Come here.

14:58.283 --> 15:02.613
When you land, the end will hit
your knee and break your jaw.

15:02.830 --> 15:08.287
Lose your reserve. You won't need it,
we're jumping low. You're fine.

16:28.757 --> 16:30.299
Come on.

16:38.309 --> 16:42.722
–I'm sorry, sergeant.
–Don't be. Grab your rifle, let's go.

17:05.003 --> 17:07.791
Where'd you get that from, Hoobler?

17:15.265 --> 17:18.017
I think I love Holland.

17:18.435 --> 17:23.013
–Where'd you get these?
–That farmhouse over there.

17:23.232 --> 17:26.767
Just sitting out in the open.
I don't know…

17:26.986 --> 17:30.107
maybe they were expecting us.

17:33.660 --> 17:35.321
Boys.

17:38.457 --> 17:40.117
I made it!

17:41.169 --> 17:43.541
I wonder if they hit anything.

17:51.054 --> 17:53.890
Goodbye, air support.

17:56.560 --> 18:01.803
There's some kind of holdup ahead.
We're going in through this field.

18:03.151 --> 18:07.279
Move out! Able Company, let's go!
Move it! Move it!

18:20.294 --> 18:23.711
Won't be able to shoot as straight
with that on.

18:48.450 --> 18:51.237
Okay, hold your fire.

19:14.812 --> 19:16.556
Hey, kid!

19:16.814 --> 19:21.275
–Bull! Have you seen Captain Winters?
–No, why?

19:21.486 --> 19:24.404
Keep your squad moving!

19:28.494 --> 19:32.326
–Where are all the Germans?
–They could be anywhere.

19:33.374 --> 19:37.538
Keep moving! Keep moving!

19:39.672 --> 19:41.499
Pardon me.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.129
Come on, lady.

19:49.642 --> 19:53.390
–Dick, clock's ticking.
–Yeah.

19:54.856 --> 19:58.806
–Thank you. Thank you.
–Thank you.

19:59.068 --> 20:01.738
Thank you, you're very kind.

20:01.947 --> 20:04.864
–What's up, Welshy?
–Snipers.

20:05.284 --> 20:07.989
We've gotta get to these bridges.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.658
All right.

20:11.916 --> 20:13.410
Hashey.

20:17.922 --> 20:22.300
–Watch the camera. Ready?
–Okay, everybody, here we go.

20:23.679 --> 20:28.839
Sergeant Talbert, let's move!
We got work to do.

21:34.923 --> 21:39.336
–What did they do?
–They slept with the Germans.

21:39.886 --> 21:42.674
The men who collaborated
are being shot.

21:42.890 --> 21:46.722
Mr van Kooijk here
is with the Dutch Resistance.

21:46.977 --> 21:51.022
We've been waiting for this day
for almost five years.

21:51.232 --> 21:53.723
He can help us secure the bridges.

21:53.985 --> 21:59.228
Yes. Together we can push
the remaining Germans out of Eindhoven.

21:59.491 --> 22:04.568
–Any idea where they might be?
–We're still working on that right now.

22:04.997 --> 22:08.034
His friends are gathering information.

22:08.292 --> 22:13.667
His contacts saw the British 2nd and
Guards Armored pass half an hour ago.

22:13.923 --> 22:17.293
–They're kids.
–These are reliable reports.

22:17.511 --> 22:21.378
Anything we can do
to help you, we will do. Anything.

22:23.058 --> 22:25.217
Right on time.

22:44.623 --> 22:45.952
Captain.

22:46.626 --> 22:50.955
I'll be happy to show you
the quickest route to the bridges.

22:56.219 --> 22:57.927
Glad to have your help.

22:58.138 --> 23:02.183
Get scouts to the town's edge
in case we spend the night.

23:17.743 --> 23:21.112
Hey, van Klinken. Webster.

23:22.289 --> 23:26.122
Sleeping outside is for suckers, guys.

23:29.464 --> 23:32.798
This better be good.
I was almost asleep.

23:41.560 --> 23:43.886
Sprechen Sie Englisch?

23:44.146 --> 23:47.765
–Ja. A little bit.
–What were you doing down there?

23:47.984 --> 23:53.441
It's an air-raid shelter. We've been
in there since the planes flew over.

23:53.657 --> 23:57.524
We're Americans. Paratroopers.

23:58.245 --> 24:03.453
–The Germans are gone?
–Think so. You see any, let us know.

24:03.668 --> 24:06.242
–You here to stay?
–Long as we have to.

24:06.462 --> 24:10.460
–Yeah, they don't tell us very much.
–Or feed us much.

24:11.551 --> 24:15.134
Please, wait here.

24:15.764 --> 24:20.640
–See that? I say screw Paris.
–Don't talk about screwing, all right?

24:20.853 --> 24:24.898
They all speak English and love us.
What a great country.

24:25.108 --> 24:26.650
Take a look.

24:26.901 --> 24:30.021
–Here. Take.
–Danke.

24:30.238 --> 24:32.278
–Here, try.
–Are these olives?

24:32.491 --> 24:34.946
–Thanks. Danke.
–Yeah.

24:41.208 --> 24:43.664
–Zigaretten?
–Yeah.

25:15.412 --> 25:17.986
He never tasted chocolate.

25:27.258 --> 25:29.797
It's pretty good, isn't it?

25:56.373 --> 26:01.499
–Oh, man, you know, I hate eggs!
–Here, sarge, you can have this one!

26:07.177 --> 26:11.756
–Vincent van Gogh was born in Nuenen.
–Yeah? So what?

26:12.141 --> 26:16.518
Sure teach you a lot
of useful stuff at Harvard.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.860
Mellet!

26:58.858 --> 27:01.812
–Look at General Patton!
–What's he doing?

27:02.070 --> 27:05.106
Makes quite a target, don't he?

27:08.243 --> 27:09.738
Lieutenant!

27:12.331 --> 27:13.706
Sniper!

27:13.916 --> 27:15.375
Sarge!

27:17.378 --> 27:22.835
Clear the tracks! Move it!
Get behind the tanks!

27:23.051 --> 27:25.091
–Shit!
–Come on! Come on!

27:27.431 --> 27:29.305
Come on, get in the ditch!

27:41.404 --> 27:44.192
Medic up front! Medic up front!

27:46.326 --> 27:50.194
–What should we do?
–Keep down. Stay still.

27:51.207 --> 27:56.628
–Keep moving! Get up! Keep moving!
–Go!

27:59.007 --> 28:00.750
Go! Keep moving!

28:02.636 --> 28:05.127
Let's go! Move out!

28:05.973 --> 28:10.931
Move! Move! Keep moving! They shoot
at stationary targets! Move!

28:21.406 --> 28:24.775
To the farmhouse! Deploy right!

28:33.961 --> 28:36.250
–Take the right side!
–Right!

28:36.506 --> 28:37.917
Go!

28:44.181 --> 28:46.055
Go on!

29:17.050 --> 29:18.378
Kraut!

29:20.512 --> 29:24.012
–Shit!
–Move! Goddamn it, move!

29:24.350 --> 29:27.137
Go! Come on! Come on!

29:40.909 --> 29:43.483
–What's he saying?
–He said “away.”

29:43.746 --> 29:48.657
Which either means that the Germans
have gone or he wants us to go.

30:00.222 --> 30:01.965
Go! Go!

30:18.241 --> 30:20.115
Ramirez!

30:32.715 --> 30:34.424
Beat it!

30:36.344 --> 30:39.014
All right, fellas, set them up.

31:13.718 --> 31:14.750
Tiger.

31:20.267 --> 31:22.011
Shit.

31:30.570 --> 31:33.275
Heffron! On me!

31:36.618 --> 31:38.694
Stay low.

31:42.667 --> 31:45.336
–You got a can opener?
–I don't, sarge.

31:52.427 --> 31:57.303
We've got a Kraut tank, 100 yards
on the left part of that haystack!

31:58.600 --> 31:59.799
I don't see it.

32:00.019 --> 32:03.554
Put a few shells through
that building, you'll see.

32:03.773 --> 32:08.352
I can't. My orders are no unnecessary
destruction of property.

32:08.611 --> 32:10.818
He's right there!

32:11.031 --> 32:16.322
I believe you. But if I can't see
the bugger, I can't shoot him, can I?

32:16.578 --> 32:18.655
Are you staying or going?

32:24.087 --> 32:26.044
He'll see you real soon!

32:29.759 --> 32:32.926
What the hell is he doing?

33:04.422 --> 33:05.585
Forward!

33:08.802 --> 33:11.174
–Fall back!
–Go!

33:11.513 --> 33:13.672
–Go!
–Fire!

33:34.663 --> 33:35.992
Fire!

33:46.718 --> 33:49.292
Fall back! Fall back!

33:50.305 --> 33:53.639
Take cover! Take cover!

34:13.163 --> 34:17.208
There's a ditch on the other side.
Follow me through.

34:21.797 --> 34:23.873
Van Klinken!

34:59.088 --> 35:01.211
Bull!

35:02.175 --> 35:05.591
Pull back! Pull back!
Let's go! Let's go!

35:09.141 --> 35:11.383
Come on, go! Go!

35:14.522 --> 35:15.897
Fire!

35:17.942 --> 35:20.231
Rifle grenade!

35:20.487 --> 35:24.864
MG42, 10 o'clock. Nail them!

35:25.784 --> 35:27.362
Fire!

35:45.764 --> 35:48.404
–We had to leave him!
–He's still alive!

35:48.559 --> 35:52.723
–Who's hurt?
–Van Klinken. Other side of that hedge.

35:54.357 --> 35:56.480
Shit!

36:02.616 --> 36:04.359
Okay, ready!

36:12.752 --> 36:14.828
Fall back! Fall back!

36:15.088 --> 36:17.164
Fall back!

36:25.432 --> 36:28.967
Pull back! Pull back!
Alley! Pull back!

36:32.648 --> 36:34.855
Go! Pull back!

36:37.404 --> 36:41.236
Fall back! Go! Go!

36:42.367 --> 36:44.443
–Webster, take over!
–Where?

36:44.661 --> 36:46.785
Get him to the rear!

36:46.997 --> 36:50.164
–What'll we do, lieutenant?
–I'm not sure!

36:50.418 --> 36:54.119
They're about to unflank us!
Let's get out of here!

36:54.339 --> 36:56.331
Mortar!

37:05.726 --> 37:08.811
–-cut the road!
We have infantry everywhere!

37:08.980 --> 37:12.812
Armor has cut the road!
We are covered in infantry!

37:13.026 --> 37:15.184
–Fall back!
–We're pulling back!

37:15.403 --> 37:18.321
–Luz, fall back!
–It's a hold-down!

37:23.245 --> 37:26.412
–Hash, where's Randleman?
–I don't know!

37:26.624 --> 37:28.866
Get out of here.

37:44.143 --> 37:45.970
Miller!

37:54.112 --> 37:58.490
Come on. Hashey, let's go!

38:03.831 --> 38:05.824
Stay low! Get down!

38:09.962 --> 38:12.039
Medic!

38:14.467 --> 38:17.255
Go get a medic! Keep moving!

38:18.931 --> 38:20.389
Doc.

38:22.434 --> 38:24.012
–Hey, doc.
–Lieutenant.

38:24.228 --> 38:28.096
It's gone right through.
Side to side, both cheeks.

38:29.692 --> 38:32.266
–Malarkey, get him out of here!
–What?

38:32.487 --> 38:36.236
–Leave me here for the Germans.
–What? Are you nuts?

38:36.450 --> 38:40.578
–We'll carry you!
–I weigh more than you two combined.

38:42.289 --> 38:43.665
Come on!

38:46.878 --> 38:49.832
–What the hell are you doing⁈
–Help us!

38:50.048 --> 38:55.209
Get back to the tanks!
Germans coming up on the other side!

39:01.268 --> 39:03.178
Keep moving! Keep low!

39:08.109 --> 39:11.063
Come on, let's go! Up you go.

39:11.279 --> 39:14.613
–One bullet, four holes.
–It's almost a miracle.

39:14.825 --> 39:16.734
We don't know where Bull is.

39:16.994 --> 39:19.829
–Keep it moving, sergeant.
–Yes, sir.

39:20.039 --> 39:23.622
Let's go, let's go! Go!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

39:23.876 --> 39:25.833
Move them out! Let's go!

39:26.462 --> 39:28.087
Hurry up! Let's go!

39:29.007 --> 39:32.506
–How bad?
–I don't know yet.

39:33.178 --> 39:34.720
Nix!

39:34.972 --> 39:38.222
I'm all right! I'm all right.
Am I all right?

39:38.475 --> 39:42.805
–Yeah. You feel all right?
–Yeah. Quit looking at me like that.

39:45.692 --> 39:50.318
Captain, we got four dead, 11 injured.

39:50.572 --> 39:55.068
–Okay, let's move them out.
–And, sir, Randleman's missing too.

39:55.327 --> 39:57.699
–Randleman?
–Yes, sir.

39:57.955 --> 39:59.782
Okay, let's go.

40:33.076 --> 40:36.777
–Where's the Bull?
–Don't know.

43:08.829 --> 43:12.364
I never fired a shot the whole time.

43:17.338 --> 43:20.505
–Find anything out?
–About what?

43:20.759 --> 43:22.383
Anything.

43:24.262 --> 43:26.967
What we're doing next?

43:27.641 --> 43:29.266
Nope.

43:31.687 --> 43:34.688
I heard one thing.
Lt Brewer's gonna make it.

43:34.899 --> 43:38.434
–What?
–Lieutenant Brewer's gonna make it.

43:38.695 --> 43:42.563
–No, there's no way.
–They'll probably send him home.

43:42.783 --> 43:44.656
How is that possible?

43:44.868 --> 43:47.538
He turned his head
at the last second…

43:47.788 --> 43:52.000
when Sergeant Randleman
called out to him.

45:14.632 --> 45:16.257
Here.

45:24.268 --> 45:26.059
Just pu—
Fuck!

45:26.312 --> 45:28.720
Just pull it out.

46:33.426 --> 46:35.503
Come on.

46:38.807 --> 46:40.930
–Okay.
–Here.

46:43.854 --> 46:46.143
Go! Go.

49:18.981 --> 49:23.276
Hoob, any news of the Bull yet?

49:26.740 --> 49:32.576
If there ain't no body, then there
ain't nobody fucking dead. Understand?

49:32.788 --> 49:34.448
I'm gonna look for him.

49:34.665 --> 49:38.959
Not by yourself, I'll go with you.
Let me get some ammo.

49:39.170 --> 49:41.127
That's okay…

49:41.923 --> 49:44.841
I'll go.
–Me too.

49:47.220 --> 49:49.462
All right.

49:51.141 --> 49:53.430
Go get him.

50:00.735 --> 50:04.104
All right, what the hell.

50:05.949 --> 50:08.654
I ain't going back up there.

50:26.805 --> 50:28.881
Webster, us or them?

50:33.312 --> 50:34.937
Not us.

50:56.421 --> 51:00.584
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

51:16.192 --> 51:17.900
Go, go.

51:36.881 --> 51:39.799
They're bombing Eindhoven.

51:42.095 --> 51:43.755
Yeah?

51:48.769 --> 51:53.147
Come on, Nix.
We'll dig in for the night.

51:55.234 --> 51:59.185
Won't be waving so many orange flags
at us tomorrow.

53:37.012 --> 53:39.254
Where the fuck you been?

53:39.890 --> 53:42.808
–Glad to see you boys.
–Not as glad as us.

53:43.227 --> 53:45.800
Bet you thought we'd given up on you.

53:46.022 --> 53:48.180
–Shut up, Cobb.
–What?

53:48.441 --> 53:51.810
I think we should go back now.

53:52.695 --> 53:54.937
Johnny, look.

53:55.532 --> 53:56.730
Bull!

54:01.538 --> 54:03.911
–Hey, Johnny.
–Get a little lost?

54:04.125 --> 54:06.995
–Something like that.
–Good to see you.

54:09.464 --> 54:12.434
I don't know whether to slap you
or kiss you.

54:12.509 --> 54:15.611
–I told them you was okay.
–They didn't listen?

54:15.804 --> 54:19.469
They wanted to go on a suicide run
to drag you back.

54:19.683 --> 54:23.551
–Is that right?
–Yeah, I told them don't bother.

54:24.981 --> 54:28.065
Never did like this company none.

54:28.943 --> 54:31.861
–You got a piece of gum?
–Yeah.

54:33.448 --> 54:36.449
–So they found you.
–Wait, what did you say?

54:36.660 --> 54:37.940
Don't irrigate me.

54:38.203 --> 54:41.288
Now who's more stupid,
you or the hick?

54:41.540 --> 54:44.292
All right, mount up! Let's move out!

54:44.543 --> 54:46.417
Grab your gear! Let's go!

54:47.296 --> 54:49.622
2nd Platoon, grab your gear!

54:49.883 --> 54:53.797
–1st Platoon!
–Fall in now! Cobb, move it!

54:54.054 --> 54:56.047
Dukeman, round them up!

54:56.306 --> 55:00.055
1st Platoon!
Grab your gear, let's go!

55:20.583 --> 55:24.628
The Germans are concentrating
their armor up near Veghel.

55:24.837 --> 55:27.329
We may be heading into more tanks.

55:27.590 --> 55:31.291
Well, as long as there's
only old men and kids.

55:31.553 --> 55:33.178
Yeah.

55:34.431 --> 55:36.922
I don't like retreating.

55:37.142 --> 55:39.847
First time for everything.

55:41.314 --> 55:45.062
How are the other divisions
faring up North?

55:48.196 --> 55:51.945
We're gonna have to find
another way into Germany.

09:00:00.000 --> 09:00:01.000
