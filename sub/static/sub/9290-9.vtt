"Previously on" 24.

00:14.761 --> 00:17.833
Sir, everything that's happened today,
from the infected body at Health Services...

00:17.929 --> 00:21.641
to Ramon Salazar's prison break has been
part of an elaborate sting operation.

00:21.737 --> 00:23.881
Mr. President, a group
of scientists from the Ukraine...

00:23.978 --> 00:26.474
were trying to sell a weaponized virus
on the open market.

00:26.570 --> 00:28.842
I suggested the Salazars
as potential buyers.

00:28.938 --> 00:31.274
Our goal was to remove the virus stockpile
from the marketplace...

00:31.370 --> 00:35.786
but all of this hinged on me convincing
the Salazars that I had switched sides.

00:35.883 --> 00:38.475
Tell me how the man who betrayed us
is now our friend.

00:38.571 --> 00:40.971
Bauer came to me with an opportunity...

00:41.067 --> 00:43.787
to make more money
than we have ever dreamed of.

00:43.883 --> 00:47.084
- What's in it for you, Jack?
- Fifty million dollars.

00:47.180 --> 00:49.964
I would never have thought
that Jack Bauer was for sale.

00:51.661 --> 00:53.485
You said you'd
take me away from here.

00:53.581 --> 00:56.428
- Do you remember, Jack?
- Yes, I remember.

00:56.524 --> 00:59.053
There was one small thing
you forgot to mention.

00:59.149 --> 01:01.197
You were a cop.

01:01.294 --> 01:03.854
But even that wouldn't matter if you'd
meant half the things you said to me.

01:03.950 --> 01:06.478
I meant everything
I ever said to you.

01:06.574 --> 01:09.774
For the next few hours,
all of our resources are dedicated...

01:09.870 --> 01:12.815
to helping Jack Bauer
intercept this virus.

01:12.910 --> 01:15.727
Tony, I spoke to Chase.
He is not coming back to C. T.U.

01:15.823 --> 01:18.191
He still thinks my father
was captured by the Salazars.

01:18.288 --> 01:21.519
And he thinks he's going in to rescueJack.
Damn it. If he goes in there...

01:21.615 --> 01:23.952
he's gonna blow Jack's cover,
and we're gonna lose this virus.

01:24.048 --> 01:26.928
I know this man.
He's Bauer's partner!

01:27.025 --> 01:29.297
- "What the hell is going on here, Jack?"
- "Shut up, Chase."

01:29.392 --> 01:31.441
- You should never have followed me down here.
- You're with them?

01:31.537 --> 01:33.777
Yes. I'm with them.

01:37.874 --> 01:40.722
- "Jack."
- Shut up, Chase. You want to get
through this, just shut up.

01:43.250 --> 01:46.162
- " The transponder"
in Jack's watch just went dead.
- Damn it!

01:46.257 --> 01:49.842
By the time the assault teams are in
position, we'll have no idea where he is.

01:49.939 --> 01:55.028
The following takes place
between 9:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.

02:04.212 --> 02:06.133
Ladies and gentlemen, the president
will make a brief statement.

02:06.229 --> 02:08.917
There will be no questions
at this time.

02:18.966 --> 02:21.591
My fellow Americans,
good evening.

02:21.687 --> 02:24.918
A few hours ago, I had to terminate
the presidential debate...

02:25.014 --> 02:29.495
in order to handle what was
at the time a national security threat.

02:29.592 --> 02:33.496
I can't reveal to you at this time
the details surrounding the situation.

02:33.592 --> 02:36.632
Those will be forthcoming
in the next few hours.

02:36.727 --> 02:40.824
Let me assure you that the danger
that existed a few hours ago has passed.

02:40.921 --> 02:43.897
America is safe.

02:43.993 --> 02:45.977
The American people
are safe.

02:46.074 --> 02:50.010
I apologize to my opponent,
Senator Keeler...

02:50.105 --> 02:55.130
and to the millions of you who were expecting
to see the two of us engage in the issues.

02:55.226 --> 02:57.051
The debate will be
rescheduled.

02:57.146 --> 03:01.114
I'd like to thank you all for your patience
and understanding. Good night.

03:01.211 --> 03:04.219
- Mr. President!
- There have been rumors
that this crisis was manufactured...

03:04.315 --> 03:07.708
by your administration to protect
your friend, Dr. Anne Packard.

03:07.803 --> 03:10.460
How do you respond to that, sir?

03:13.147 --> 03:16.284
Those allegations were false.

03:16.380 --> 03:19.325
Senator Keeler's charges were
unfounded, and we have proof...

03:19.421 --> 03:22.717
proof that comes directly
from Anne Packard's ex-husband.

03:22.846 --> 03:25.212
In fact, in the next
few days and weeks...

03:25.309 --> 03:27.901
Senator Keeler will have
his own explaining to do.

03:27.998 --> 03:33.663
Anne Packard is an individual
of the utmost integrity.

03:33.758 --> 03:36.926
- She didn't deserve this.
- Mr. President!

03:37.022 --> 03:38.847
Thank you. Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:38.942 --> 03:41.087
That's it. No more questions.
Thank you.

03:41.182 --> 03:43.551
Bauer's with
the Salazar brothers in Mexico.

03:43.679 --> 03:45.983
His transponder signal
stopped working.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.032
We're doing everything we can
to reestablish contact.

03:48.128 --> 03:51.264
Tell the Delta units to hold
their position till I get back to ya.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.944
All right. Thanks.

03:55.040 --> 03:58.177
Why don't we try an amplification module?

03:58.273 --> 04:01.249
I already cycled through it three times.
It's not a weak signal. There's "no" signal.

04:01.345 --> 04:03.489
What do we think happened here?

04:03.585 --> 04:05.954
There's a strong possibility
that Jack's cover might have been blown.

04:06.049 --> 04:09.506
There's no indication that his transponder's
been found or that his cover's been blown.

04:09.602 --> 04:13.219
It may be that he's in a place where he can't
get a signal, or the transponder's broken.

04:13.315 --> 04:15.138
Partial damage might have
knocked it to another frequency.

04:15.235 --> 04:17.954
- Let's run a scan.
- "I'm doing that now."

04:18.051 --> 04:20.387
I'm only a third way through the spectrum,
but so far no luck.

04:20.483 --> 04:23.459
All right. Uh,
I'll get ya some help.

04:24.740 --> 04:26.596
- Kim.
- Yes, Tony?

04:26.691 --> 04:28.516
- "Do you know how to do a frequency scan?"
- Yeah.

04:28.611 --> 04:31.012
Okay. We're trying to pick up
your father's transponder signal.

04:31.108 --> 04:33.060
Michelle's already begun the scan.
Coordinate with her.

04:33.157 --> 04:35.749
- Uh, what's the signature?
- I already told you... 30 over five.

04:35.846 --> 04:39.461
- You didn't tell me.
- Look, Kim.

04:39.557 --> 04:43.302
I know this is hard on you,
your father's life being at stake...

04:43.398 --> 04:45.991
- but I need you to focus, okay?
- Sorry.

04:59.720 --> 05:05.000
All right. Good.
Call me if anything changes.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.584
- Why are we stopping?
- "Tomas says there's no sign"
of anyone following us.

05:08.681 --> 05:10.729
Until we know more,
we're better off staying here.

05:14.858 --> 05:17.577
Could he have come here
on his own without backup?

05:17.673 --> 05:20.874
Maybe he came
by himself to rescue you.

05:20.970 --> 05:23.115
How sad.
Does it bother you, Jack...

05:23.210 --> 05:25.771
that your partner is going to die
trying to save you?

05:25.867 --> 05:27.690
It breaks me up.

05:34.284 --> 05:37.612
This man Amador should have
called by now to set up the meeting.

05:37.740 --> 05:41.036
He's gonna call. Don't worry.
Just make sure you've got your money ready.

05:41.164 --> 05:44.876
The money's ready.

05:44.973 --> 05:47.597
Yeah.

05:48.653 --> 05:50.478
It's Amador.
We're ready.

05:50.574 --> 05:55.117
- Where?
- Put Bauer on the phone. I only deal with him.

06:02.574 --> 06:04.719
- This is Jack.
- Hello, Jack.

06:04.814 --> 06:08.495
Five kilometers north of town a trail splits
off the road into the woods.

06:08.591 --> 06:11.440
- Take it for two kilometers, fifteen minutes.
- Got it.

06:12.656 --> 06:16.209
The meeting's north of here.
Fifteen minutes.

06:17.392 --> 06:20.592
Hey, wait.
The phone.

06:20.689 --> 06:24.337
- What if he calls back?
- I'll take a message.

06:27.505 --> 06:31.793
Look at you, Jack.
You are a mess.

06:31.889 --> 06:34.033
We gotta get you straight,
or you'll never get through this.

06:34.130 --> 06:35.955
I'm not gonna fix.

06:39.987 --> 06:43.219
Take them. You'll feel better.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.924
I need to use
the bathroom.

06:56.020 --> 06:59.765
They're in the back.

07:03.958 --> 07:06.677
- I want you to get some sleep.
- I'm not tired.

07:06.773 --> 07:09.974
- I'll wake you when it's time to leave.
- Where's Hector?

07:10.069 --> 07:13.654
He's busy. You'll see him
tomorrow morning.

07:13.751 --> 07:16.279
Go to sleep.

07:16.375 --> 07:18.200
I love you.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.336
Claudia, stay down.
Stay down.

07:34.553 --> 07:37.561
I need you to listen to me.

07:37.657 --> 07:41.242
Hector and Ramon are trying
to buy a virus to use as a weapon.

07:41.337 --> 07:43.354
Millions of people could die.
I've set up this deal...

07:43.451 --> 07:45.817
so my government could
take control of the virus and destroy it.

07:45.946 --> 07:48.410
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- You're still with C.T. U?

07:48.506 --> 07:51.963
- Yes, I'm still with C.T.U.
- But you broke Ramon out of prison.

07:52.059 --> 07:54.747
That was so I could gain his trust...
to make the deal happen.

07:54.843 --> 07:57.467
I cannot allow this virus
to get into the wrong hands.

07:57.563 --> 08:00.379
You've betrayed us once.
Now you've come to betray us again?

08:00.476 --> 08:02.812
No, "them."
Not you.

08:02.908 --> 08:04.796
I was a fool
to believe any of it.

08:04.892 --> 08:07.613
"I'm going to protect you. I'm going to get
your family somewhere safe."

08:07.709 --> 08:09.980
- All lies.
- I wanted to come back for you earlier...

08:10.076 --> 08:12.861
but when I heard about this virus,
I had to deal with it.

08:12.956 --> 08:15.485
Millions of lives are at stake.
You have to understand that.

08:17.662 --> 08:21.213
But I can get you out now...
you, Sergio and your father.

08:23.645 --> 08:26.654
- How?
- American soldiers are not far from here.

08:26.751 --> 08:31.199
They're waiting for my signal, but I can't reach
them, because my transmitter's been destroyed.

08:31.295 --> 08:35.327
Claudia, I have nothing to gain
from telling you this if it's not the truth.

08:35.423 --> 08:37.568
One word from you
and I'm a dead man.

08:42.496 --> 08:44.545
What do you want
me to do?

08:44.641 --> 08:47.776
First I need a cell phone.
I need to let C.T.U. Know where I am.

08:47.872 --> 08:51.425
Then I need you to do whatever
you can to help my partner, Chase.

08:51.521 --> 08:54.978
- Keep him alive.
- When Hector realizes, he's gonna kill me.

08:55.073 --> 08:58.497
You'll be gone by then.
Chase can help you get out. I promise.

08:58.594 --> 09:04.002
But if I can't contact C.T.U., this is all
for nothing. You've gotta get me that phone.

09:04.099 --> 09:07.331
- "Please?"
- I'll do what I can.

09:22.788 --> 09:24.997
I have to go.
They're waiting for me.

09:26.692 --> 09:31.109
If you're lying to me again,
I'll kill you myself.

09:34.951 --> 09:36.902
Help Chase.

09:51.559 --> 09:54.504
Jack Bauer broke
Ramon out of prison.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.641
Your people are sending
forces to bring them back.

09:57.737 --> 09:59.561
When are they coming?

10:02.889 --> 10:04.841
When?

10:06.537 --> 10:08.585
And where?

10:23.211 --> 10:25.355
Aaah!

10:29.739 --> 10:32.428
He was your partner.
You must be feeling something.

10:32.525 --> 10:34.892
Aaah!

10:35.021 --> 10:37.996
I got a 50 million dollar
payday when this deal goes down.

10:38.092 --> 10:40.204
He's on his own.

10:42.157 --> 10:45.102
Is he as tough as you?

10:45.197 --> 10:48.367
He still believes in the lie.

10:48.462 --> 10:51.919
- What lie?
- That what he's doing has purpose.

10:52.014 --> 10:54.511
Belief is a beautiful thing.

10:54.606 --> 10:56.463
Hello?

10:57.647 --> 11:01.200
"Aaah!"

11:09.936 --> 11:12.882
- Where are you going?
- Please.

11:12.977 --> 11:15.825
No, don't leave.

11:18.386 --> 11:21.938
- "Ay, mi amor."
- Sit down for me.

11:26.994 --> 11:32.531
Ramon is waiting, okay?
All right. All right.

11:32.626 --> 11:35.283
- " Aaah!"
- "Bueno."

11:58.998 --> 12:02.039
Claudia.

12:02.134 --> 12:06.134
- I left my phone inside.
- I'll get it.

12:08.215 --> 12:10.551
Let's go.

12:15.320 --> 12:19.832
Oh, God! Aaah! Aaah!

12:35.226 --> 12:37.050
- "Chloe."
- What?

12:37.146 --> 12:38.971
- Have you heard from Chase?
- No.

12:39.066 --> 12:41.626
Are there alternate frequencies
he might use to contact you?

12:41.722 --> 12:44.475
Yeah, there are, and they're on autoscan.
He hasn't checked in.

12:44.570 --> 12:47.099
Look, Chloe. I know that you're busy.
Maybe we can reach him by satellite.

12:47.195 --> 12:50.235
Satellite. Good idea. I didn't think
of that, Kim. I'll get right on that.

12:50.332 --> 12:54.043
You don't have to be sarcastic with me,
Chloe. This is someone I care about.

12:54.139 --> 12:56.188
Get a grip.

12:56.283 --> 12:58.108
I have to update
the president in half an hour.

12:58.205 --> 13:01.436
I don't want to tell him we're in the same place
we were a half hour ago, which is nowhere.

13:01.533 --> 13:04.029
I don't... I don't want excuses.
Just get me the answer, all right?

13:05.310 --> 13:07.133
I need to finalize the comm file.

13:07.229 --> 13:09.117
It should have been
done already.

13:09.214 --> 13:11.614
Well, I need the format code,
and you said you were gonna download it.

13:11.741 --> 13:13.566
Delta-733-Gulf.

13:14.654 --> 13:17.183
That's the code
from the previous file.

13:22.271 --> 13:24.767
Delta-723-Bravo.

13:24.864 --> 13:26.944
- Thank you.
- All right.

13:29.696 --> 13:31.552
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

13:31.647 --> 13:34.625
Eight minutes shot
to hell on an invalid code.

13:40.321 --> 13:42.529
Access granted.

13:42.625 --> 13:46.721
Now that could have been a disaster. Without
those files, we can't track the rescue teams.

14:00.067 --> 14:01.956
" Come."

14:06.500 --> 14:09.540
Bad news.
C.T.U. Lost track of Jack Bauer.

14:09.635 --> 14:11.684
- Is he in trouble?
- We don't know.

14:11.780 --> 14:14.821
- Does he have possession of the virus yet?
- We don't know that either.

14:14.917 --> 14:16.965
Come.

14:18.565 --> 14:22.309
Mr. President, I have Alan Milliken
on the line for you.

14:25.062 --> 14:27.270
I'll take it.

14:32.998 --> 14:36.615
- Alan?
- David? You angry with me?

14:36.711 --> 14:38.791
Of course I'm not
angry with you.

14:38.888 --> 14:42.312
Your first time in L.A.
In three years and you don't even call.

14:42.408 --> 14:44.776
It's been a bad day, Alan.

14:44.871 --> 14:47.848
I know. I've been
watching the news.

14:47.944 --> 14:51.048
I don't want to add to your burdens,
but I'd like to come by and see you.

14:51.145 --> 14:53.129
See me?

14:53.225 --> 14:56.618
David, I wouldn't ask
if it weren't important.

14:56.712 --> 14:58.537
I know you're busy.

14:58.634 --> 15:01.482
After all, you are the president
of the United States.

15:01.610 --> 15:04.522
In large part,
thanks to you.

15:04.618 --> 15:07.755
I'll come to you, Alan.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

15:07.851 --> 15:10.155
Thank you, David.
And one more thing.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.330
As a personal favor
to me...

15:13.451 --> 15:16.844
I'm asking you
not to bring Wayne.

15:16.940 --> 15:18.828
May I ask why?

15:18.924 --> 15:21.228
That's something I'd rather
explain in person.

15:22.220 --> 15:24.780
All right.

15:34.188 --> 15:37.486
- Where are we?
- So far...

15:37.613 --> 15:41.518
I'm not able to pick up
Jack on any of our imagery.

15:41.615 --> 15:43.438
How long we been
out of contact?

15:43.535 --> 15:45.519
His tracking beacon
went dead...

15:45.615 --> 15:48.143
- 27 minutes ago.
- Last known location?

15:48.238 --> 15:50.831
Here.

15:50.927 --> 15:53.296
He can't be much farther out
than 30 miles in any one direction.

15:53.391 --> 15:56.560
- Unless he was choppered out.
- No way. Air tactical's watching the skies.

15:58.097 --> 15:59.984
Where's Bauer at?

16:03.312 --> 16:05.841
We don't know yet.

16:05.937 --> 16:09.522
That's great.
So, this entire operation...

16:09.618 --> 16:12.401
which hinges on Jack being on-site
when they deliver the virus...

16:12.497 --> 16:15.794
is going down the tubes
because we don't know where he is.

16:15.921 --> 16:19.378
- "How does that happen?"
- Look, Ryan. You wanna chew us out, do it later.

16:19.474 --> 16:21.299
We're trying to get
this back on track.

16:21.395 --> 16:23.219
I will.

16:23.314 --> 16:25.811
You better find Bauer
and make this thing work, Tony.

16:25.906 --> 16:28.884
Otherwise the two of you and Jack,
assuming he's still alive...

16:28.979 --> 16:31.316
are gonna take the fall for everything
that happened today...

16:31.412 --> 16:34.165
from the prison riots
to Salazar's escape...

16:34.260 --> 16:36.404
and every dead body in between.

16:40.181 --> 16:42.933
So what happens if Jack goes
to this meeting without backup?

16:44.982 --> 16:46.870
The Salazars get the virus.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.229
What happens from there?

16:51.285 --> 16:53.110
I don't know.

17:11.192 --> 17:13.079
Feeling better?

17:13.175 --> 17:15.000
I'm fine.

17:22.137 --> 17:24.154
Amador.

17:25.656 --> 17:30.074
Hello, Jack. So these must be the buyers
you're representing.

17:30.170 --> 17:33.210
This is Hector
and Ramon Salazar.

17:36.507 --> 17:39.547
There's $100 million in escrow
accounts in Geneva and Hong Kong.

17:39.643 --> 17:42.267
We're prepared to give immediate
instructions to have the money transferred...

17:42.364 --> 17:45.500
as soon as we have confirmation
that the virus has been delivered.

17:45.596 --> 17:49.052
There's been a complication.
Another buyer is interested in the virus.

17:49.149 --> 17:51.356
- What are you talking about? We have a deal.
- What's going on, Jack?

17:51.452 --> 17:53.276
- I don't know.
- I had nothing to do with it.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.701
There's a new development that has
just surfaced in the last few hours.

17:56.829 --> 17:59.357
We'll hold an auction, and the virus
will go to the highest bidder.

17:59.454 --> 18:02.269
- You son of a bitch!
- No!

18:02.365 --> 18:06.014
Mr. Salazar, I merely represent
the wishes of my client.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.599
May we have a moment?

18:09.695 --> 18:12.031
Of course.

18:14.016 --> 18:16.479
Hector, this does not
need to be a problem.

18:16.575 --> 18:19.168
- It's a huge problem.
- Think it through.

18:19.263 --> 18:21.183
You add 40 to 50 million
dollars to this price tag...

18:21.312 --> 18:24.928
and you're still looking
at over an 800 million dollar profit.

18:25.025 --> 18:27.808
You said you could move the virus for a
billion dollars. That was your estimate, right?

18:27.904 --> 18:30.177
- Something like that.
- You've come this far. Don't stop.

18:30.272 --> 18:32.097
Let it play out.

18:32.193 --> 18:34.561
The other buyer's here.

18:51.843 --> 18:54.339
You know her?

19:01.637 --> 19:04.452
What the hell is he
doing here?

19:04.548 --> 19:08.133
- That man is a federal agent.
- "I know who he is, Nina. Everything's fine."

19:08.228 --> 19:10.885
No, it's not. He's setting
us up. You have to kill him.

19:10.981 --> 19:12.869
Kill him!

19:12.998 --> 19:15.686
First one who fires gets
cut down! That's a promise.

19:21.798 --> 19:24.038
Why is he here?

19:24.135 --> 19:27.623
- He represents a buyer, Nina, just like you.
- No, he doesn't.

19:27.720 --> 19:31.304
Believe me. I know him.
Whatever he's told you, he's lying.

19:31.399 --> 19:35.496
I don't work for C.T.U. anymore, Nina.
I work for myself.

19:41.224 --> 19:43.304
- I'm out of here.
- " Nina, please."

19:43.400 --> 19:46.185
- Let her go and honor the original agreement.
- Nina!

19:46.281 --> 19:48.585
I don't think
your client's gonna be too happy...

19:48.682 --> 19:51.209
if you walk out and let the virus
go to another buyer!

19:54.538 --> 19:57.962
We gotta close
this deal.

19:58.058 --> 20:02.987
We have a wide perimeter, lookouts everywhere,
and we're monitoring every frequency.

20:03.084 --> 20:06.379
There's no law or military
within 25 kilometers.

20:08.780 --> 20:11.084
You know how I work.

20:11.180 --> 20:13.004
This area
is completely secure.

20:13.100 --> 20:15.853
If I had the slightest doubt,
I wouldn't be here.

20:18.029 --> 20:21.165
Now, I suggest we all take
a few minutes to calm ourselves...

20:22.925 --> 20:24.910
and I'll explain
the ground rules...

20:25.005 --> 20:27.182
and we'll proceed
with the bids.

20:27.277 --> 20:29.102
Agreed?

20:30.861 --> 20:32.686
Agreed.

20:35.086 --> 20:38.255
- Fine.
- "Good."

21:20.371 --> 21:22.195
- How are you?
- Fine, sir. Thank you.

21:34.357 --> 21:37.269
- David.
- Alan, it's good to see you.

21:37.365 --> 21:39.221
Thanks for finding
the time to fit me in.

21:39.318 --> 21:43.799
You've always made time for me, Alan. Even
when there was no obvious reason to do so.

21:43.894 --> 21:46.038
Your potential was always
obvious, David.

21:46.133 --> 21:47.990
How are you doing?

21:48.086 --> 21:50.871
Well, I could use a few new body parts,
but besides that...

21:50.967 --> 21:53.303
Well, you look well.

21:56.952 --> 22:00.535
I know you're wondering what could be so
important that I'd ask you here...

22:00.632 --> 22:03.320
so I'll be brief
and I'll be blunt.

22:03.416 --> 22:05.241
I want your brother
off the team.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.081
I don't understand. You've always
been supportive of Wayne.

22:09.178 --> 22:12.600
I was.
I'm not anymore.

22:13.721 --> 22:16.377
What's this all about, Alan?

22:18.554 --> 22:20.442
Yes, sir?

22:20.539 --> 22:23.002
- Tell my wife to come in here.
- Right away, sir.

22:34.587 --> 22:37.115
- Julia.
- Mr. President.

22:37.212 --> 22:39.964
David is wondering why
I want him to fire Wayne...

22:40.060 --> 22:44.125
and I thought
you should explain.

22:48.221 --> 22:50.109
As you know, I've known
Wayne for some time.

22:52.285 --> 22:55.902
Three years ago,
when he was president of Alan's company...

22:55.998 --> 22:58.719
we began to spend
quite a bit of time together.

22:58.814 --> 23:01.182
Get to it, Julia.

23:03.999 --> 23:06.944
- Wayne and I became involved.
- "They had an affair..."

23:07.039 --> 23:09.024
while I was recuperating
from the stroke.

23:09.119 --> 23:11.839
That's how your brother
thanked me.

23:15.968 --> 23:18.593
Go on.

23:18.688 --> 23:21.057
We saw each other
for a year...

23:21.153 --> 23:23.329
before you asked him
to join your administration.

23:24.544 --> 23:27.073
- Then we broke it off.
- Hold on.

23:29.729 --> 23:33.154
- If you knew about this,
why didn't you say something?
- I didn't.

23:33.250 --> 23:35.715
I just found out recently.

23:35.811 --> 23:39.714
Did you know, David?
Did you keep it from me too?

23:39.811 --> 23:41.699
Of course not.

23:41.827 --> 23:44.196
- I can hardly even believe it's true.
- It's true.

23:50.084 --> 23:51.907
- I've told you how sorry I am.
- You can go.

23:54.885 --> 23:56.708
I waited for you to come
to Los Angeles...

23:56.805 --> 23:58.982
so I could do this
face-to-face.

24:00.485 --> 24:04.486
I gave your brother my company,
and he took my wife.

24:04.581 --> 24:06.821
Now I'm taking away his job.

24:08.902 --> 24:12.551
Wayne is my chief of staff,
my closest friend. I trust him.

24:12.647 --> 24:14.470
I don't.
Neither should you.

24:14.566 --> 24:16.454
He's dishonest.

24:18.727 --> 24:21.031
I think you'll agree, David...

24:21.128 --> 24:24.456
that you wouldn't be where you are
without my support over the years.

24:26.567 --> 24:29.256
I've never asked you
for anything in return...

24:29.352 --> 24:31.912
but I'm asking you now.

24:32.009 --> 24:34.121
Fire Wayne.

24:35.145 --> 24:36.970
I'm sorry, Alan.
I can't do that.

24:43.114 --> 24:45.578
I'm disappointed...

24:46.666 --> 24:48.715
not surprised.

24:48.811 --> 24:52.330
And you know me well enough
not to be surprised if there are repercussions.

24:52.427 --> 24:55.083
I hope you're not
threatening me.

24:55.179 --> 24:58.924
I don't make threats, David.
I just tell it like it is.

25:00.076 --> 25:03.052
You let me know
if you change your mind.

25:14.478 --> 25:17.421
Have them open up the field search
to these coordinates. Tell them it's priority.

25:17.517 --> 25:20.334
- Do you want me to ask them...
- Sorry. I don't mean to interrupt...

25:20.430 --> 25:22.894
- but can I see you for a minute?
- Do you have enough to go on?

25:22.991 --> 25:26.415
- I'll let you know if the satellite
guys give me any trouble.
- Okay.

25:28.847 --> 25:32.431
- What is it?
- "It's actually about Tony."

25:32.527 --> 25:34.864
Look.

25:34.959 --> 25:36.784
I don't know if he's...

25:36.879 --> 25:40.048
You don't know if he what?

25:40.143 --> 25:43.216
I don't know if he's
well enough to do his job.

25:43.312 --> 25:47.377
Kim, he was shot a few hours ago.
He's not gonna be working at full capacity.

25:47.473 --> 25:51.473
I know. But what if he misses something
important? I mean, he's running things.

25:51.570 --> 25:55.506
- What happened?
- He asked me to finalize the comm files...

25:55.601 --> 25:58.130
but he forgot to give me
the format codes.

25:58.226 --> 26:02.163
And then just before, he chewed me out for
forgetting something he thought he told me...

26:02.259 --> 26:04.658
except he never told me.

26:04.786 --> 26:06.675
He's under a lot of stress.
We all are.

26:06.803 --> 26:08.659
That's my point.

26:08.755 --> 26:10.612
Michelle, you're his wife...

26:10.707 --> 26:12.628
but you're also
second in command.

26:12.755 --> 26:15.540
If Tony can't do the job,
somebody has to tell Chappelle...

26:15.636 --> 26:17.460
and I think that someone
should be you.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.870
What are you doing?

26:36.022 --> 26:38.390
Taking a rest.

26:38.487 --> 26:40.343
There's oil under
Hector's truck.

26:40.439 --> 26:43.735
It needs to be fixed
before Hector gets back.

26:43.862 --> 26:46.488
Now!

26:47.927 --> 26:50.136
Okay. I'll check it out.

27:16.923 --> 27:19.163
Here. I have
a message from Jack.

27:19.258 --> 27:22.556
Can you hear me?
Things aren't what they seem.

27:22.651 --> 27:24.476
Jack isn't really
with Ramon and Hector.

27:24.571 --> 27:28.732
Everything he's done
has been to earn their trust.

27:28.828 --> 27:31.580
The virus that they're going to buy,
Jack is going to take it from them.

27:31.676 --> 27:36.092
Do you understand? There are soldiers
from your country not far from here.

27:36.189 --> 27:39.997
- They'll come when Jack calls for them.
- Claudia?

27:40.126 --> 27:43.870
Jack promised to get me and my family
out of here if I help you.

27:43.965 --> 27:48.702
- Then help me.
- I can't now. There are too many men around.

27:48.830 --> 27:52.287
Don't give up.
I'll figure out a way.

27:52.383 --> 27:54.367
All right?

28:01.056 --> 28:05.345
Each party will make one final bid in writing.
Amador wants to start in the next 10 minutes.

28:05.472 --> 28:07.745
You have to come up
with a number.

28:07.841 --> 28:10.208
We are offering a hundred.

28:10.337 --> 28:13.985
She must have made him an offer to make
this worthwhile... say another 50.

28:15.329 --> 28:17.378
- So we go 175.
- More.

28:17.473 --> 28:20.994
If we do this, we do it to win.
At least 200.

28:27.074 --> 28:28.899
Make the calls.

28:32.643 --> 28:34.723
Who is she?

28:36.195 --> 28:38.500
I told you.
She worked for me at C.T.U.

28:38.595 --> 28:42.532
No. There's more between
you and this woman.

28:45.476 --> 28:47.716
She killed my wife.

28:53.413 --> 28:56.230
Is this going to be
a problem, Jack?

28:58.053 --> 29:01.926
No. No problem.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.520
- Where are we going?
- We'll be together.

29:20.649 --> 29:23.048
We're together now.
Is Hector coming with us?

29:23.176 --> 29:25.577
- Sergio, just be ready to leave.
- But what about Hector...

29:25.704 --> 29:29.097
Sergio! Forget about Hector!
Just do what I'm telling you!

29:50.283 --> 29:52.171
What are you
going to do?

29:52.299 --> 29:56.013
Jack said that if I help his partner,
he'll get us out of here, Papa.

29:56.108 --> 29:59.980
These people... Ramon, Hector, Jack Bauer.
You can't trust any of them.

30:00.109 --> 30:03.373
Jack's not like
Ramon and Hector.

30:03.469 --> 30:06.318
Papa, please. This is our chance
to get out of here.

30:09.518 --> 30:12.142
Then go.

30:12.237 --> 30:15.950
No. No, we're all going.

30:16.046 --> 30:18.414
No, I'm not going
without you.

30:32.112 --> 30:33.969
What about Landsat
Alpha-39?

30:38.192 --> 30:40.529
Yeah. That's
about it, right?

30:40.624 --> 30:42.833
Thanks.

30:44.049 --> 30:45.874
I just checked all the N.S.A. Logs.

30:45.970 --> 30:48.178
There's no satellites going
through the area we think Jack's in.

30:48.274 --> 30:51.378
I'll check the flight
paths just in case.

30:51.474 --> 30:53.810
Just in case what?
I just checked it.

30:56.371 --> 30:58.196
There have been other
mistakes today, Tony.

31:00.563 --> 31:03.763
Mistakes.
That you think I made?

31:03.860 --> 31:06.739
Sweetheart, you should
still be in the hospital.

31:06.868 --> 31:09.044
- "You're not a hundred percent."
You should step down.
- I'm fine.

31:09.140 --> 31:11.509
- And after what you've
been through today, I don't see...
- I just said, "I'm fine!"

31:11.637 --> 31:15.284
All right?
End of discussion, please.

31:15.381 --> 31:18.517
Tony. I've got something. The N.S.A.'s got
a satellite we may be able to reposition.

31:18.614 --> 31:21.910
We just have to ask
for access.

31:22.901 --> 31:25.078
- All right. Thanks.
- Yeah.

31:39.031 --> 31:42.328
I'd like to redo that e-mail
and determine how best to use...

31:42.455 --> 31:45.081
these resources for these
compressed l-4s.

31:45.176 --> 31:48.345
Um, as for the information
packets, they have online synoptic...

31:48.441 --> 31:50.265
Yes?

31:50.361 --> 31:52.920
- I need to talk to you, Ryan.
- Hold on.

31:56.057 --> 31:57.881
I don't think Tony
should be here right now.

31:57.978 --> 32:00.250
My understanding is he's not
in any imminent danger.

32:00.346 --> 32:02.202
No, it's not that.

32:02.299 --> 32:05.818
I've had reports he's been forgetful,
missing things.

32:05.914 --> 32:08.283
- Like what?
- Key information...

32:08.378 --> 32:11.259
format codes,
things that are causing delays.

32:11.387 --> 32:16.443
On any other day I wouldn't
be worried about this, but...

32:16.539 --> 32:18.620
I'm just not sure
if he's up to it today.

32:18.715 --> 32:20.540
If I pull him now,
that sets us back two.

32:20.636 --> 32:25.693
No one can replace what he does. He, Gael and
Jack have been working this from the beginning.

32:25.789 --> 32:27.645
Unless you think his mistakes
are significant enough...

32:27.741 --> 32:29.629
I do...

32:30.941 --> 32:33.566
or else I wouldn't
be bringing this to you.

32:36.926 --> 32:41.342
All right. Just let me wrap up
this call and I'll get into it.

32:41.438 --> 32:43.646
Thank you.

32:48.992 --> 32:51.359
I understand that,
but you need to make it happen.

32:51.488 --> 32:53.824
- We're working on it, sir.
- All right. Thanks.

32:53.919 --> 32:57.376
- I just got back from seeing Alan.
- What did he want?

32:57.472 --> 33:00.225
- Oh, I think you know.
- Know what, David?

33:00.321 --> 33:03.297
He wants me to "fire" you!

33:03.393 --> 33:05.216
What the hell
were you thinking?

33:05.313 --> 33:07.713
Carrying on an affair
with a married woman...

33:07.841 --> 33:09.665
the wife of my biggest supporter!

33:09.761 --> 33:13.474
Listen. I "am" sorry. But it was
a mistake, and I corrected it.

33:13.570 --> 33:16.226
Not in Alan's mind.
For him, this is fresh.

33:17.825 --> 33:21.218
He just found out,
and he wants to make you pay.

33:23.971 --> 33:26.595
Look. We both know you can't afford
to make an enemy out of Alan.

33:26.692 --> 33:29.060
He wields too much power.

33:29.156 --> 33:31.428
So, I'll resign.

33:31.523 --> 33:34.500
You'll leave only if I decide
it's the right thing to do!

33:34.596 --> 33:36.421
- Not Alan Milliken.
- David.

33:36.516 --> 33:40.805
Alan is a very dirty fighter.
Trust me.

33:40.933 --> 33:43.301
Are you sure you want to get down
in the gutter with that man?

33:43.428 --> 33:45.637
You haven't left me
much choice. Have you?

34:11.208 --> 34:14.824
- You wanna see me, Ryan?
- "Yeah."

34:16.456 --> 34:18.346
- What's going on?
- I asked you here...

34:18.440 --> 34:20.297
because your competency has
been brought into question.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.953
By whom?

34:24.456 --> 34:27.562
By me.

34:27.658 --> 34:30.313
- An employee came to me
with some concerns, and l...
- An employee?

34:30.411 --> 34:34.058
- Kim Bauer.
- And I felt I needed to address them.

34:34.155 --> 34:37.003
With Ryan. You didn't
come to me first.

34:37.130 --> 34:39.148
- I tried to talk to you, Tony. You wouldn't...
- " That's enough."

34:39.243 --> 34:41.100
The point is, Ryan,
that they're wrong.

34:41.196 --> 34:43.116
I am fit for duty.
Completely.

34:44.523 --> 34:46.603
All right.
When you entered the room...

34:46.699 --> 34:49.068
the monitor was on.

34:49.164 --> 34:51.116
Tell me what it showed.

34:58.573 --> 35:01.646
On the left side was a CTAN
schematic of the country...

35:01.741 --> 35:06.479
indicating an ongoing investigation
in Florida, New York and Montana.

35:06.607 --> 35:10.286
On the right side was an all-clear report
from the Austin branch.

35:10.383 --> 35:12.271
That's correct.

35:12.367 --> 35:15.823
It still doesn't ease my mind considering
the slips you made.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.480
- What slips?
- Michelle?

35:20.144 --> 35:24.400
You thought you gave Kim the signature
on the frequency scans. You didn't.

35:24.496 --> 35:29.873
Not verbally, no. I put them on her in-screen
15 minutes before I talked to her.

35:29.969 --> 35:33.234
Anything else?

35:33.330 --> 35:36.401
She said you didn't load
the format codes onto the grid in time.

35:36.498 --> 35:39.569
No, I didn't load the format
codes onto "her" grid.

35:39.666 --> 35:43.891
I put them in the shared volume,
on time. Check it.

35:57.428 --> 35:59.252
It's there.

36:02.293 --> 36:04.533
All right.
I'm sorry, Tony.

36:04.628 --> 36:07.477
- We're done here.
- Good.

36:15.734 --> 36:19.511
You've wasted time
we don't have.

36:43.705 --> 36:47.290
She's clear.

36:49.433 --> 36:52.186
He's clear.

37:07.452 --> 37:10.236
- Are you ready with your bids?
- Yes.

37:10.332 --> 37:12.381
Yes.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.124
Let me see them.

37:31.358 --> 37:34.207
The banks will verify
the presence of these funds?

37:35.263 --> 37:38.590
Yes, that is correct.

37:48.576 --> 37:51.136
The bank will verify
those as well.

37:53.601 --> 37:57.121
Your bid is
$225 million.

37:57.218 --> 37:59.041
Hers is 240.

38:00.898 --> 38:02.785
Nina, you win.

38:06.338 --> 38:10.499
- You are a dead man.
- My people will escort you out.

38:14.915 --> 38:17.699
The transfer will take place in two hours.

38:21.860 --> 38:23.972
You said you were going
to deliver the virus and you didn't!

38:24.068 --> 38:27.332
Not now, Hector.
Come on.

38:30.820 --> 38:34.533
- I'll be contacting you with the details.
- Excellent.

38:34.629 --> 38:36.454
- We'll be waiting for your call.
- Let's go!

39:00.392 --> 39:03.465
You can't let Nina Myers just walk away
from this. You gotta put a man on her.

39:03.561 --> 39:06.376
- Shut up.
- Ramon, listen to me.

39:06.473 --> 39:09.385
If Nina gets away now,
she'll disappear. You'll never find her again.

39:09.513 --> 39:12.105
You had your chance, Jack.

39:41.900 --> 39:44.748
All right.
This is good enough.

39:50.958 --> 39:53.773
- Ramon, please. You're making a mistake.
- Get out.

39:53.870 --> 39:56.750
- I can explain. I didn't know that there were...
- Get out!

39:59.790 --> 40:02.094
You're of no use to us anymore!
You failed!

40:02.191 --> 40:04.975
Hector, don't do this!

40:05.072 --> 40:07.183
Ramon, think this through.

40:07.279 --> 40:10.831
What about all your buyers around the world
that you promised the virus to?

40:10.928 --> 40:14.481
They're gonna know you were double-crossed
and that you did nothing about it.

40:14.576 --> 40:18.928
What are you gonna say to them?
"I'm sorry; we'll try and get it right next time"?

40:19.056 --> 40:22.704
The Salazar name will be a joke!
You can't let that happen!

40:24.241 --> 40:28.178
Come on! Five hours ago,
you were in an American prison...

40:28.274 --> 40:30.802
and now you're free
because I broke you out!

40:30.897 --> 40:33.042
And then I brought you
the deal of a lifetime!

40:33.138 --> 40:36.402
What do I have to do to prove
to you I'm on your side?

40:40.019 --> 40:43.154
This deal can still happen!
We can get the virus!

40:43.251 --> 40:47.668
- How do you get the virus?
- I told you... the woman, Nina!

40:47.763 --> 40:49.748
The woman, she is the problem!
She outbid us!

40:49.876 --> 40:52.404
I know her! I trained her!
I can get to her!

40:52.501 --> 40:54.869
- You don't even know how to find her!
- I'll find her!

40:54.965 --> 40:57.301
Please, Ramon.
You can't lose here.

40:57.396 --> 40:59.765
If I fail, you get
to kill me. Fine.

40:59.893 --> 41:02.486
But if I succeed, the deal will go forward.
We'll be back on track.

41:02.582 --> 41:05.590
We'll all get paid!

41:07.510 --> 41:10.358
Please.

41:13.079 --> 41:15.511
Hector.

41:16.759 --> 41:19.608
Let's play this out
a little longer.

41:26.300 --> 41:28.252
The man has more lives than a cat.
