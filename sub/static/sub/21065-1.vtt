00:25.031 --> 00:29.309
<i>Ah, Venice Beach... a city built on contrast.</i>

00:29.531 --> 00:33.598
<i>Decade old concrete buildings layered
between million dollar homes.</i>

00:33.698 --> 00:37.276
<i>Worn out beach bums litter the same
streets your cousins from Oklahoma...</i>

00:37.376 --> 00:38.977
<i>...visit every summer.</i>

00:39.077 --> 00:43.705
<i>Every weird dive bar you love is being
pushed out by some shitbag tech company.</i>

00:43.805 --> 00:46.898
<i>And somewhere between the ruckus,
you'll find this guy...</i>

00:46.998 --> 00:49.398
<i>...Venice's only licensed detective.</i>

00:49.498 --> 00:53.698
You just gotta live your life.
It goes by so fast. It's like a whisper.

00:53.798 --> 00:55.565
<i>That's my boss, Steve Ford...</i>

00:55.665 --> 00:58.197
<i>...a self-appointed figurehead
in the community.</i>

00:58.297 --> 01:00.465
<i>Takes that job very seriously.</i>

01:00.565 --> 01:04.431
Before you know it, you're 12 years old,
and then where are you?

01:04.531 --> 01:07.331
I don't want you to make
the same mistakes that I made.

01:07.431 --> 01:11.598
It starts like this, a little bit of weed,
and then a little bit of blow, okay?

01:11.698 --> 01:14.331
And then a couple bottles
of tequila every week.

01:14.431 --> 01:16.398
And hookers three times a week.

01:16.498 --> 01:19.831
And, yeah, it's fun, in the moment,
it's fun, but let me tell you something.

01:19.931 --> 01:23.331
Those moments always end up
when your head feels like this big...

01:23.431 --> 01:25.171
...like a bus ran over it.

01:25.271 --> 01:29.200
You happy about that?
No, you're not happy about that.

01:29.300 --> 01:33.213
Then not too long after that,
you're sitting on your kitchen floor...

01:33.313 --> 01:35.598
...buck naked, you got a gun in your mouth...

01:35.698 --> 01:39.498
...and all you're thinking
about is, is today the day?

01:39.598 --> 01:43.812
Is today the day I pull the trigger? Bang!

01:45.665 --> 01:47.863
But you got a right to live...

01:49.162 --> 01:53.180
...and you gotta fuckin' live right,
you get me?

01:55.631 --> 01:57.473
All right.

01:58.034 --> 02:02.071
Let's go. This is a skate park,
come on. Let's go skate.

02:21.431 --> 02:23.631
<i>I always wanted to be a private detective...</i>

02:23.731 --> 02:26.755
<i>...and with Steve being the only outfit
in town, I really had no other choice...</i>

02:26.855 --> 02:30.098
<i>...but to work with him.
Which is good... I think.</i>

02:30.198 --> 02:33.968
And seeing as he was busy mentoring
the local youth of today...

02:34.068 --> 02:39.363
...I was left to finally get a shot
at cracking my first case...

02:39.463 --> 02:43.365
...and it has led me here,
to Nola Tuiasosopo...

02:43.465 --> 02:46.465
...at least, I believe I'm pronouncing
that right, I don't know, she's Samoan.

02:46.565 --> 02:48.364
Not that there's anything wrong with that...

02:48.464 --> 02:52.031
...some of them have tricky
last names, some of them.

02:52.131 --> 02:54.458
Well, I'll edit that later. Uh...

02:54.558 --> 02:59.498
Missing since July. I just spotted her
at the corner of sixth and Oakwood.

02:59.598 --> 03:04.884
And, let me tell you, Steve was not
exaggerating, Nola is very attractive.

03:04.984 --> 03:08.244
Scratch that, she is very, very insanely...

03:08.344 --> 03:10.964
...why isn't she a professional
model-attractive.

03:11.064 --> 03:16.615
Anyway, by the looks of it, she's going
into a support group of some kind.

03:16.714 --> 03:21.112
I'm guessing Alcoholics Anonymous, just...

03:22.731 --> 03:24.965
Shit. Dammit.

03:25.665 --> 03:28.431
<i>And my name's John, Steve's partner.</i>

03:28.531 --> 03:32.813
<i>Uh, well, soon to be partner,
just waiting for some paperwork.</i>

03:36.764 --> 03:38.780
Who'd like to go first?

03:46.797 --> 03:50.631
Hello, my name's Rick and I'm a sex addict.

03:51.130 --> 03:52.997
Hi, Rick.

03:53.497 --> 03:55.301
My poison's pornography.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.931
It started back in Catholic school
and got progressively worse.

03:59.930 --> 04:02.632
I'm currently logging about 40 hours a week.

04:02.731 --> 04:04.599
That's a full-time job.

04:05.198 --> 04:07.431
I've got premium subscriptions
to the big four...

04:07.531 --> 04:10.331
...PornHub, RedTube,
Reality Kings and Brazzers.

04:10.431 --> 04:13.078
Not to mention, EskimoTube...

04:13.773 --> 04:15.575
...JizzHut...

04:18.998 --> 04:21.060
Oh, God, I'm a monster!

04:25.730 --> 04:28.702
Jesus, right?

04:29.131 --> 04:31.198
Would you like to share with the group?

04:31.298 --> 04:32.598
Hm?

04:32.697 --> 04:35.549
- Would you like to share with the group?
- The group? Uh...

04:35.648 --> 04:38.730
...no! No, I'm good. I'm good to just listen.

04:38.830 --> 04:40.898
That's not really how it works.

04:40.998 --> 04:45.180
Everyone is required to participate
on their first night, please.

04:48.131 --> 04:50.731
Well, if it's required.

04:54.406 --> 04:55.992
Okay.

04:57.909 --> 04:59.771
I'm John...

05:00.375 --> 05:04.091
- ...and I'm a sex addict.
- Hi, John.

05:04.191 --> 05:08.331
Hello. Uh, yeah, I just love sex.

05:08.431 --> 05:10.797
I love getting it, I love giving it.

05:10.897 --> 05:14.898
I love it too much and I get it too much,
that's my main problem.

05:14.998 --> 05:20.164
On that sex road, I've got my thumb out,
waiting to get on one of the sex cars.

05:20.464 --> 05:24.397
I am also logging about 40 hours a week...

05:24.497 --> 05:28.431
...but on sex, not just
jacking off like this guy, right?

05:28.531 --> 05:31.438
Full-blown sex. And, actually,
come to think of it...

05:31.538 --> 05:35.138
...it's more than 40 hours.
So, I'm doing time and a half.

05:35.398 --> 05:40.830
I should get paid my overtime. I mean,
obviously I'm not condoning sex for money.

05:40.930 --> 05:44.670
That's bad, right?
We all agree, would you? Good.

05:44.770 --> 05:49.680
I really just have sex with...
any old thang that comes my way.

05:50.130 --> 05:52.543
There's some limits, obviously, age...

05:52.643 --> 05:55.664
<i>...18 and below is no... no bueno, no good.</i>

05:56.164 --> 05:58.897
Upwards, though, is where I really shine...

05:58.997 --> 06:02.498
...50, 60, 80, 90, centennials...

06:02.597 --> 06:06.846
- Okay! Uh, thank you for sharing, John.
- All right, you got it.

06:22.597 --> 06:25.165
- Nola? Hey, Nola?
- Are you following me?

06:25.265 --> 06:29.230
No, no, no, I'm not following you.
No, no, don't mace me!

06:29.330 --> 06:32.184
I'm not a stalker. I...

06:32.284 --> 06:34.664
...I am technically following you,
but not in a stalker way...

06:34.764 --> 06:39.030
...just as a professional...
strictly professional.

06:39.529 --> 06:43.764
Look, your brothers
hired my boss to find you...

06:44.364 --> 06:47.378
...and that's where I come in.

06:48.197 --> 06:51.053
They want you to come home,
okay, they miss you.

06:52.664 --> 06:56.398
I could drive you,
at least to my boss' house.

06:56.697 --> 06:58.568
In a professional way...

06:58.668 --> 07:02.633
...not as a maniac or a pervert,
on either parts.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.998
Yeah, uh, I'll let her know.

07:11.197 --> 07:13.931
All right, so you'll be
safe there till tomorrow...

07:14.031 --> 07:19.539
...and then in the morning we can figure out
how best to deal with your brothers.

07:22.730 --> 07:25.930
Well, how about that Rick guy?
40 hours a week?

07:26.030 --> 07:30.097
I mean, that's a serious
commitment to masturbation.

07:30.297 --> 07:32.530
Yeah, hopefully he's changing
hands every once in a while.

07:32.630 --> 07:35.264
I mean, if you don't,
that's carpal tunnel syndrome...

07:35.364 --> 07:38.158
- And the blistering, and chafing.
- Ugh. Yeah.

07:38.259 --> 07:42.331
Let's just hope he's got
a little tub of like, Neosporin.

07:42.430 --> 07:44.865
- Ew!
- Well, I'm just saying.

07:45.464 --> 07:46.998
Sorry.

07:54.997 --> 07:57.730
- Okay, well, this is it.
- Great.

07:57.830 --> 08:00.631
As you can see,
it's a very nice establishment.

08:00.931 --> 08:03.131
And, uh, you'll be home in no time.

08:03.430 --> 08:05.064
<i>Send her up.</i>

08:05.164 --> 08:06.998
There he is.

08:07.098 --> 08:11.730
Steve's a great guy.
All right, well, pleasure to meet you.

08:11.830 --> 08:12.964
- You, too.
- Yeah.

08:13.064 --> 08:16.099
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem, just doing my job.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.388
- Goodbye.
- See ya.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.147
She'll be fine.

08:29.464 --> 08:31.347
Steve's a good guy.

08:32.697 --> 08:34.599
She'll be fine.

09:38.998 --> 09:41.744
Stay down! You're gonna wish
you never touched her!

09:41.844 --> 09:45.694
- Stop it, you're gonna kill him!
- Nola, take your ass in the goddamn room...

09:45.794 --> 09:47.231
...and don't you come out of there!

09:47.330 --> 09:49.330
Listen, listen, let's talk about this.

09:49.430 --> 09:51.679
You're about to go through a Samoan storm.

09:53.330 --> 09:56.279
- Paid you to find her, Steve.
- I did find her!

09:57.031 --> 09:59.300
We told you to find her, not fuck her.

09:59.530 --> 10:02.514
- She's our sister, you son of a bitch.
- Yeah.

10:14.898 --> 10:17.100
You're dead, Steve!

10:20.263 --> 10:22.579
Run, Steve, run!

10:40.397 --> 10:43.464
Okay, hands, pal! Let me see your hands!

10:43.564 --> 10:46.846
I said hands, now, get them up!

10:47.297 --> 10:48.664
Aw, Jesus.

10:48.764 --> 10:51.230
Oh, Bill, it's you. Jesus,
how you doing, man?

10:51.330 --> 10:55.664
Steve, what the hell are you doing out here?
Aren't you tired of this Peter Pan bullshit?

10:55.764 --> 10:58.757
This is no kind of life, you're an old man.

10:58.857 --> 11:03.197
Why don't you just meet somebody your
own age and make a life, for God sakes?

11:03.296 --> 11:05.681
- I will.
- You know, someday, Steve...

11:05.781 --> 11:08.931
...one of these guys is gonna catch you
and what are you gonna do then?

11:09.131 --> 11:14.131
Call 9-1-1, come find you,
we're gonna eat a lot of donuts.

11:14.230 --> 11:16.500
- Fuck you, Steve. Go home.
- Take care of yourself.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.254
- Be careful.
- This is not normal, okay?

11:19.354 --> 11:22.445
They hook electrodes up
to people when they do this.

11:26.330 --> 11:28.536
Well, that's what that feels like.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.397
There he is, get him!

11:46.964 --> 11:49.726
Turn, turn, hurry up! Hurry up!

11:50.594 --> 11:52.646
Go, go, go!

11:53.463 --> 11:56.498
- Oh, yeah, we got him now.
- Faster.

11:57.697 --> 12:00.979
Go, go, go, go, go! Look at this asshole!

12:10.797 --> 12:13.245
- Shit!
- Come on, let's go, let's go.

12:15.563 --> 12:17.368
Excuse me.

12:17.564 --> 12:19.943
Steve, you can't have a gun in the bar!

12:22.131 --> 12:23.979
You motherfucker!

12:28.764 --> 12:31.412
Let's go, go, go!

12:36.230 --> 12:38.245
Go, go, go, go!

12:47.463 --> 12:49.864
Tino, Tino. Let me in!

12:51.100 --> 12:52.843
Where'd he go?

12:52.944 --> 12:55.964
- Yo, open up, man. Come on.
- You're naked.

12:56.064 --> 13:00.296
- What? Yeah, naked. Please let me in.
- I can't take another heart break, Steve.

13:00.396 --> 13:03.230
- The car? That's what this is about?
- I loved that car, Steve.

13:03.330 --> 13:06.523
- Oh, man, come on, Tino.
- It was stolen and I asked for your help.

13:06.623 --> 13:08.964
- I'm sorry, all right?
- I got feelings and I'm sensitive.

13:09.064 --> 13:11.531
I know you're sensitive. I understand!

13:12.475 --> 13:14.584
Alright, I'll get the car,
I'll get the car for you.

13:14.684 --> 13:15.864
- Say you promise.
- I promise.

13:15.964 --> 13:18.816
- You're not saying it. No!
- I promise you I'll get it. I promise.

13:18.916 --> 13:20.634
- Fingers up.
- Let me in, man, all right!

13:20.734 --> 13:23.809
- Cover that dick, I got pizza here.
- All right, yeah.

13:29.630 --> 13:31.130
Fuck.

13:35.864 --> 13:38.280
<i>- Orale.
- Pull, fucker!</i>

13:41.697 --> 13:44.730
I'm not going in there.
That's Spyder's place.

13:44.830 --> 13:47.731
My car's in that guy's garage, Steve,
you gotta get it for me.

13:47.831 --> 13:50.431
I'm not a repo man, okay,
I'm a fucking detective.

13:50.531 --> 13:54.810
You promised, Steve. I saved your ass,
Steve. Your word is your bond.

13:54.910 --> 13:58.130
- Okay, all right.
- Your word is your bond!

13:58.230 --> 14:02.630
- Your word is your bond!
- All right, just relax. Give me the keys.

14:02.730 --> 14:04.538
Thank you, Steve.

14:04.638 --> 14:06.524
I got this.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.272
Hell yeah, fool.

14:19.130 --> 14:23.198
Hey. Two large pepperoni pizzas.
You ordered them, right?

14:23.998 --> 14:26.664
Hey, Spyder, pizza dude's here.

14:27.263 --> 14:29.624
<i>Carlos Manuel Ochoa...</i>

14:29.724 --> 14:33.664
<i>...goes by the name of Spyder, with a "y,"
with links to the Sinaloa Cartel.</i>

14:33.764 --> 14:37.464
<i>Rumor has it he once killed a barista
at Starbucks for misspelling his name.</i>

14:37.564 --> 14:40.130
<i>Which is tricky, it's with a "y."
Not the point.</i>

14:40.230 --> 14:43.472
<i>If there's drugs being sold in Venice,
they're coming from Spyder.</i>

14:45.664 --> 14:48.297
Two pepperoni pizzas. Didn't you order that?

14:48.397 --> 14:50.846
No one ordered pizza, man.

14:51.830 --> 14:54.230
2-0-0-4, this is your pizza, right?

14:54.330 --> 14:56.747
Kinda old to be delivering pizzas, aye?

14:56.847 --> 14:59.563
You're telling me, man, my old lady
gives me shit all the time about it.

14:59.663 --> 15:01.478
How much?

15:03.396 --> 15:05.025
$25.00.

15:06.597 --> 15:10.563
Thanks, man, thank you, that's plenty.
Hey, man, can I use your restroom?

15:10.663 --> 15:12.631
I've been in the car a long time.

15:13.130 --> 15:15.769
- One or two?
- One.

15:16.730 --> 15:19.297
- All right, bro.
- Where is it?

15:19.397 --> 15:21.864
To the left. Don't piss on the seat, huh?

15:21.963 --> 15:23.838
All right.

15:24.697 --> 15:27.030
Who the fuck are you,
are you a cop? Huh? Huh?

15:27.130 --> 15:29.416
- No.
- Huh? Who are you?

15:29.516 --> 15:31.463
- Steve.
- Is that right?

15:31.563 --> 15:33.497
- I'm Spyder's friend.
- Yeah?

15:33.597 --> 15:35.446
That's the lavatory, right?

16:34.664 --> 16:36.216
Whoa.

16:56.463 --> 16:58.324
Hey, Spyder...

16:58.887 --> 17:01.349
...I think someone's stealing your car.

17:46.896 --> 17:48.546
Motherfucker.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.698
You killed my car.

18:05.097 --> 18:08.923
Aw, you can't kill a car like this,
man, look at it. You know...

18:09.097 --> 18:11.430
...a little hammer, a little glass.

18:11.530 --> 18:13.944
Tires still look fantastic.

18:20.164 --> 18:21.713
Sorry.

18:26.764 --> 18:28.412
Fuck!

18:44.196 --> 18:48.363
<i>Dave Jones, and no,
not the lead singer of The Monkees.</i>

18:48.463 --> 18:51.430
<i>This guy's a local legend
and Steve's longtime best pal.</i>

18:51.530 --> 18:55.897
<i>His claim to fame was surfing
the pier naked for 12 hours straight...</i>

18:55.997 --> 18:59.929
<i>...on acid. Nowadays
he's lost a lot of that mojo...</i>

19:00.029 --> 19:02.220
<i>...mainly due to a pretty nasty divorce.</i>

19:02.320 --> 19:03.763
Hey, Dave.

19:07.530 --> 19:09.812
Did you start working at Tino's Pizza?

19:12.563 --> 19:16.197
Yeah. You want my take on all of this?

19:16.597 --> 19:17.597
Yeah.

19:17.697 --> 19:20.545
Never buy a surf shop,
look at this inventory.

19:22.296 --> 19:24.930
She wants full assets and alimony, too.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.239
Sorry, man.

19:27.738 --> 19:29.702
You're gonna be all right.

19:29.801 --> 19:31.796
We'll figure something out.

19:31.896 --> 19:35.398
- Sun's gonna be up soon.
- Yeah, it is.

19:35.498 --> 19:39.670
- Should probably get some sleep.
- I just finished your new board.

19:55.263 --> 19:58.197
This has been fun,
but I gotta go pick up my dog.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.397
Why don't you just let her have Buddy?

20:00.497 --> 20:02.949
She likes that I come by to pick him up.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.653
Makes her feel better...

20:07.332 --> 20:09.198
...safer I think.

20:10.063 --> 20:11.579
Her?

20:27.530 --> 20:31.053
<i>Steve's sister has fallen on hard times
after her husband took off...</i>

20:31.153 --> 20:34.497
<i>...and emptied their bank account.
He's really been there for her.</i>

20:34.597 --> 20:36.696
<i>- Steve.
- Helping out as much as he can.</i>

20:36.796 --> 20:39.130
- Hey, Katey.
- Thanks for the coffee.

20:39.230 --> 20:41.711
<i>It's pretty selfless of him, actually.</i>

20:44.563 --> 20:48.286
<i>- See? What a guy.
- Taylor!</i>

20:48.985 --> 20:50.528
Taylor!

20:50.927 --> 20:53.127
Uncle Steve's here to pick up Buddy.

20:57.729 --> 20:59.762
Have you heard from him?

20:59.862 --> 21:02.896
Still somewhere in Australia
and finding himself.

21:02.996 --> 21:05.216
We can't afford to stay here.

21:05.496 --> 21:08.497
He thinks there's something more out there.
I mean, what the fuck is out there?

21:08.597 --> 21:10.562
Honey, I don't know.

21:11.118 --> 21:12.927
You're gonna be all right.

21:18.563 --> 21:21.429
<i>Buddy Ford, 49 years old in dog years...</i>

21:21.529 --> 21:24.429
<i>...and 100 percent Parson Russell Terrier.</i>

21:24.529 --> 21:26.447
<i>Man, does Steve love that dog.</i>

21:26.547 --> 21:28.079
Uncle Steve.

21:28.179 --> 21:30.812
Hi, Taylor. What are you studying?

21:30.912 --> 21:34.612
- Chemistry.
- Want some help with that?

21:34.712 --> 21:36.561
A.P. Chemistry.

21:39.779 --> 21:42.185
Will you bring Buddy back later tonight?

21:43.213 --> 21:46.634
How about if I bring him back every night
and pick him up first thing in the morning...

21:46.734 --> 21:48.413
...until you tell me to stop?

21:48.513 --> 21:50.961
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:51.979 --> 21:55.136
- That would be cool.
- He gets a little gassy.

21:55.236 --> 21:57.080
I don't mind it.

21:57.380 --> 22:00.031
Come on, Buddy, here we go.

22:00.816 --> 22:03.497
Come on, here you go, right out here.

22:34.046 --> 22:35.746
Sorry, no dogs.

22:35.846 --> 22:38.447
- Oh, no, he's all right.
- What does that mean?

22:38.546 --> 22:41.612
That's just something I say
when I try to circumvent the rules.

22:41.712 --> 22:43.746
- Sometimes it works.
- Mm-mm.

22:43.846 --> 22:46.706
No? All right. Get out, pal.

22:47.046 --> 22:48.861
Large coffee.

22:55.013 --> 22:57.212
You're not in your office.

22:57.312 --> 23:00.329
<i>- Lew the Jew.
- Whoa, whoa, okay...</i>

23:00.429 --> 23:04.680
<i>...I know how that sounds.
It's not offensive, everyone calls him that.</i>

23:04.780 --> 23:06.846
<i>I mean, he calls himself, "Lew the Jew."</i>

23:07.246 --> 23:09.843
- No, I'm not in my office.
- I went by your office.

23:09.943 --> 23:12.813
- And you didn't find me there?
- Steve, I want to hire you.

23:12.913 --> 23:15.546
<i>He's a savvy businessman,
and a little miserly...</i>

23:15.646 --> 23:18.465
<i>- ...but not in a Jewish way, in a normal way.
- ...girl in the picture...</i>

23:18.564 --> 23:22.512
Hey, hey, Steve, that's a lot of money
for just a few pictures, you know?

23:22.612 --> 23:25.712
Yeah. Could've cost you a lot more money.

23:25.812 --> 23:28.246
Why are we arguing? Let's talk business.

23:28.346 --> 23:31.180
Thank you. I'll see you later, Lew.

23:32.079 --> 23:33.947
Let's go, Buddy.

23:34.447 --> 23:36.316
Some son of a bitch graffiti punk...

23:36.416 --> 23:40.013
...has been spray-painting
the walls of my apartment buildings.

23:40.912 --> 23:43.556
I could certainly help you with that.
I know many of the taggers...

23:43.656 --> 23:46.380
...in the neighborhood, the only
problem is, you still owe me money.

23:46.479 --> 23:49.713
Aw, Steve, I can't pay you for that. You
understand, it's the principle of the thing.

23:49.813 --> 23:53.712
Steve! We're getting the band
back together, bro!

23:53.812 --> 23:55.979
- Great! Yeah!
- My man!

23:56.079 --> 23:58.860
Taylor Swift saved the music industry!

23:59.679 --> 24:02.414
- Who the hell is that?
- No clue.

24:02.513 --> 24:04.528
I'll sell you the house back.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.646
- My parent's house?
- Yeah.

24:08.746 --> 24:13.376
You'll sell it back to me?
At the same price they sold it to you for?

24:13.846 --> 24:16.539
Come on, Stevie, you're killing me, man.

24:16.639 --> 24:20.646
I mean, this is Silicon Beach now.
You realize what I could get for that house?

24:20.746 --> 24:22.627
No deal.

24:23.645 --> 24:25.495
Ten percent more.

24:31.246 --> 24:33.379
I can see this is
really important to you, Lew.

24:33.478 --> 24:35.280
What gave it away?

24:35.979 --> 24:38.623
- I want it in writing.
- You're killin' me.

24:38.723 --> 24:41.428
Fine, let's go. I gotta show it to you.

24:44.479 --> 24:46.847
Holy Christ.

24:46.947 --> 24:48.887
See what I mean?

24:48.987 --> 24:52.350
- I like it.
- You could see how I might not.

24:52.879 --> 24:55.246
He's really captured your essence.

24:55.346 --> 24:59.086
- Why don't you just paint over it?
- I painted over it four times.

24:59.186 --> 25:01.626
You should have seen the other shit,
it was filthier than this.

25:01.726 --> 25:04.734
- I can't imagine anything filthier than this.
- Just get it done, Steve...

25:04.834 --> 25:07.114
...if you want your parent's house back.

25:07.613 --> 25:09.461
Just pay me.

25:12.347 --> 25:15.579
Don't look at that, come here,
don't look at that.

25:23.779 --> 25:27.148
- How about this?
- Cash only, no checks.

25:27.248 --> 25:29.163
And that's on sale.

25:29.263 --> 25:31.147
Great, thanks.

25:31.247 --> 25:35.597
She can take my shop,
but I'm not leaving her anything.

25:36.679 --> 25:39.898
- Yeah.
- I'm letting it go.

25:41.913 --> 25:44.929
You do that, pal, let it all go.

25:57.213 --> 26:01.314
<i>Now, normally by this time, Steve's
already had about eight cups of coffee...</i>

26:01.413 --> 26:04.120
<i>and he doesn't really handle
the caffeine all that well.</i>

26:04.220 --> 26:07.659
<i>So, a little secret between you and I
is I switched the brew in our office...</i>

26:07.759 --> 26:10.563
<i>...with decaf, you know,
to take the edge off.</i>

26:10.663 --> 26:14.017
John. Have you seen a picture
around here, a picture of my house?

26:14.117 --> 26:16.260
- Wow, this is good coffee.
- Uh...

26:16.792 --> 26:19.563
...the Samoans called looking for you.

26:19.663 --> 26:22.763
I said that you were very sorry.

26:22.863 --> 26:25.796
Good. You didn't give them
the address to the office, right?

26:25.896 --> 26:27.030
- No.
- Good.

26:27.130 --> 26:29.030
Although, I'm sure if they...

26:29.130 --> 26:31.745
...were to do any type
of light investigating...

26:31.845 --> 26:34.132
...they could find out where it is.

26:37.198 --> 26:39.263
What about the picture?

26:39.362 --> 26:42.160
It's a picture of my family's house.

26:42.260 --> 26:45.196
No. Look, the insurance company
said they won't pay...

26:45.295 --> 26:48.130
...until you get a couple things sorted out.

26:48.529 --> 26:51.197
A picture of my parent's house.

26:51.296 --> 26:53.281
- Yeah, I haven't seen it.
- It was on my desk.

26:53.381 --> 26:56.763
Okay, still, no house. The insurance
company said that we won't get paid...

26:56.863 --> 26:59.555
- ...until we, you know, file them.
- Mm-hm.

26:59.655 --> 27:02.709
- We're on a new case now.
- Great.

27:02.809 --> 27:07.063
Lew the Jew, all his apartment buildings,
you're getting graffiti all over the place.

27:07.163 --> 27:11.845
- There's a month of my life down the drain.
- The house, it was on my... it was right...

27:14.097 --> 27:16.529
- Sorry, this is it right here.
- Oh.

27:16.629 --> 27:20.130
Oh, well, let's see
what this photo is all about.

27:20.230 --> 27:24.263
This is me as a kid. Look, seven years
old right there. I'm holding the dog.

27:24.363 --> 27:26.463
- That's you?
- Yeah.

27:26.563 --> 27:28.396
You're such a fat kid.

27:28.496 --> 27:31.163
You know, my parent's fed me
all the wrong food, but...

27:31.262 --> 27:35.997
Yeah, a lot of it, too. Looks like you
might've had a third brother that you ate.

27:36.097 --> 27:38.429
Surprised you didn't eat the dog.

27:38.529 --> 27:42.950
Just because of how big you are.
But you're good now, so...

27:43.050 --> 27:46.129
Do you know any graffiti artists around here?

27:46.228 --> 27:48.763
- No, not personally...
- Then you should find some, how about that?

27:48.863 --> 27:52.211
Yeah, sure, definitely,
I'll find some graffiti artists.

27:55.296 --> 27:58.582
- You should get more of this coffee, too.
- Yep, definitely.

28:00.096 --> 28:03.196
Steve... I need you.

28:03.296 --> 28:05.497
I lost a lot of this weight right away.

28:06.396 --> 28:08.211
Come on, Buddy.

28:10.729 --> 28:13.960
You also lost a lot
of that hair right away, too.

28:14.729 --> 28:15.963
- Steve.
- Hey.

28:16.063 --> 28:17.596
I need your help.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.170
- All right, when?
- Right now.

28:19.269 --> 28:21.030
- Right now?
- Right now.

28:21.130 --> 28:23.130
You know why.

28:23.229 --> 28:25.261
I'm desperate.

28:25.929 --> 28:29.829
Okay. All right, Buddy,
in the back, up we go.

28:29.929 --> 28:32.545
- Right now, huh?
- Yep.

28:32.830 --> 28:34.678
Stay low, Buddy.

28:37.162 --> 28:41.363
Put this in your ear, you'll be able to
hear me talking to you the whole time.

28:42.130 --> 28:43.697
Okay.

28:44.326 --> 28:47.747
- You sure you want to go through with this?
- I have to, Steve.

28:47.847 --> 28:49.463
The first sign of trouble,
you get the fuck out of there.

28:49.563 --> 28:51.908
- I know, I will.
- I'm not kidding.

29:05.829 --> 29:07.878
Wish me luck.

29:18.663 --> 29:20.362
<i>- May I?
- Hi, Dave.</i>

29:20.462 --> 29:22.046
<i>Anne.</i>

29:30.462 --> 29:33.109
You need to sign the divorce papers, Dave.

29:33.629 --> 29:39.046
<i>Don't sign anything.
Repeat, do not sign anything, Dave.</i>

30:03.063 --> 30:04.718
Dave!

30:06.562 --> 30:09.162
I'll give you the surf shop, you can have it.

30:09.262 --> 30:12.696
<i>Don't do it. Get up and walk away.</i>

30:12.796 --> 30:14.822
You won't reconsider?

30:16.762 --> 30:18.645
It's done.

30:35.429 --> 30:37.463
Dave, it's done!

30:37.963 --> 30:39.830
<i>Careful, buddy.</i>

30:40.729 --> 30:44.162
I'm going to sign these papers
because I've learned how to let go.

30:44.262 --> 30:46.088
<i>Oh, no.</i>

30:46.188 --> 30:50.160
And if you think you deserve everything
I've ever worked for...

30:50.260 --> 30:54.563
...then I want you to have it,
including the surf shop.

30:54.663 --> 30:59.898
<i>No, no, Dave.
Don't sign anything, stop, stop.</i>

31:17.496 --> 31:19.144
I told him.

31:29.729 --> 31:31.545
I think I fucked up.

31:32.896 --> 31:34.746
It'll be okay.

31:45.062 --> 31:46.912
Come on, Buddy.

31:50.028 --> 31:52.476
You're gonna be spending
some time with Taylor.

31:55.729 --> 31:59.011
Not forever. Come on.

32:04.995 --> 32:07.678
That a boy. Go knock on the door.

33:13.596 --> 33:15.329
How ya doin'?

33:15.429 --> 33:18.375
I'm okay. How are you?

33:20.895 --> 33:23.011
You know that I think of you as a son.

33:25.458 --> 33:27.486
I did not know that, but thank you.

33:27.586 --> 33:31.896
I guess I feel like, sometimes
I think of you as a father...

33:31.996 --> 33:33.760
...in a way...

33:35.223 --> 33:38.362
- ...a very intimidating father.
- I'm gonna need your help, John.

33:38.462 --> 33:41.796
Okay, what, like out in the field?

33:41.895 --> 33:45.001
You're gonna go out there and you're gonna
find out whoever's painting these murals...

33:45.101 --> 33:48.893
- ...on Lew the Jew's walls.
- I checked out all the taggers in the city.

33:48.993 --> 33:51.925
I got nothing.
The guy doesn't leave a signature.

33:52.025 --> 33:55.629
Maybe he's not a tagger,
maybe this guy's a trained artist.

33:56.128 --> 33:59.372
- Okay, yeah, sure, yeah, that fits.
- And, John...

33:59.472 --> 34:01.478
...wear extra underpants.

34:02.829 --> 34:04.345
Why?

34:05.696 --> 34:07.262
Why?

34:07.362 --> 34:10.212
Why do I have to wear extra underpants?

34:10.312 --> 34:12.063
That's the discipline.

34:12.962 --> 34:15.795
I'm sorry, sorry,
it's part of being a detective...

34:15.895 --> 34:18.224
...to wear multiple pairs of underwear?

34:18.928 --> 34:22.545
Do you have multiple pairs
of underwear on right now?

34:23.860 --> 34:25.465
That's my secret.

34:26.995 --> 34:28.562
Cool.

34:28.661 --> 34:32.277
- Get yourself ready.
- Classic father figure.

34:53.094 --> 34:55.524
Jesus Christ, Nola.

34:55.628 --> 34:59.534
No, this has gotta stop, okay?
It really does.

35:00.183 --> 35:04.027
It's over. I cannot see you anymore.

35:05.062 --> 35:07.877
I just had to see you.

35:11.995 --> 35:13.862
Baby, oh...

35:16.595 --> 35:19.096
Steve, don't answer that.

35:19.196 --> 35:20.796
- This is Taylor.
- Who's Taylor?

35:20.896 --> 35:23.428
Hold on. Hey, honey, hi, how are you doing?

35:23.528 --> 35:25.352
<i>- Uncle Steve.
- I want you right now.</i>

35:25.452 --> 35:28.496
<i>- Who's that?
- Oh, that's the maid, she slipped and fell.</i>

35:28.596 --> 35:30.546
<i>We've been robbed, they took everything!</i>

35:30.646 --> 35:32.522
You got what?

35:33.463 --> 35:37.662
They took everything, the TV,
the stereo, Taylor's Xbox.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.937
I can't believe it, they took Buddy!

35:42.529 --> 35:44.995
Try to stay calm and wait for the cops.

35:45.095 --> 35:47.362
- Well, where are you going?
- I'm gonna go and get my dog.

35:47.462 --> 35:50.933
- Our dog.
- Our dog! Don't leave!

36:05.396 --> 36:07.229
- Rajeesh.
- I didn't see anything.

36:07.329 --> 36:09.562
- See what?
- Anything.

36:09.662 --> 36:11.995
- What the fuck you talking...
- No.

36:12.095 --> 36:14.995
Doesn't matter what it is. I'm not trying
to get into any more trouble, Steve.

36:15.095 --> 36:16.896
- Well, can I...
- No!

36:17.396 --> 36:19.696
Your security camera is pointing
right down my street.

36:19.795 --> 36:23.279
- They hate me in this neighborhood.
- Who hates you? You are beloved.

36:23.379 --> 36:26.628
Not all of them, okay, but I'm the outsider.

36:27.928 --> 36:30.212
They stole my dog, Buddy.

36:30.312 --> 36:33.573
- A delicacy in my country, right?
- I never said that.

36:33.673 --> 36:37.363
- You thought it. $200.
- $200?

36:37.463 --> 36:40.431
That's how much it costs
to betray my neighbor.

36:42.051 --> 36:44.143
What is it coming to?

36:54.745 --> 36:57.994
- How about $80?
- Fine. Loser.

37:07.928 --> 37:11.843
Two guys, druggies, they tried
to trade their stuff for some beer.

37:11.943 --> 37:15.611
They had your dog. I've seen them
hanging out down by the boardwalk.

37:18.028 --> 37:21.311
- You're a good neighbor.
- Fuck you, Steve.

37:32.476 --> 37:35.817
Hey, dickhead, can I hit that?

37:37.628 --> 37:38.962
What'd you call us?

37:39.062 --> 37:43.148
Actually, what I meant to say was
dickheads. Dickhead one, dickhead two.

37:43.248 --> 37:46.019
- Hey, fuck you, man!
- How's that?

37:46.119 --> 37:48.171
- Hey, what's your problem, bro!
- You're my problem.

37:48.271 --> 37:51.205
- You broke my nose, fag!
- Oh, shut up, who cares?

37:51.305 --> 37:53.160
- Where's my fucking dog?
- He ran away.

37:53.260 --> 37:56.315
- Yeah, he ran away. He ran away.
- What do you mean, he ran away?

37:56.415 --> 37:58.775
We gave him to our dealer,
our dealer has him.

37:58.875 --> 38:00.729
- What's his name?
- I don't know the dog's name!

38:00.829 --> 38:02.962
Not the dog's name, idiot!
What's your dealer's name?

38:03.062 --> 38:05.501
Spyder, his name is Spyder!

38:10.828 --> 38:12.650
Buddy's collar?

38:16.328 --> 38:18.811
Never fuck with a man's dog.

38:30.128 --> 38:32.332
Fuck me sideways.

38:39.561 --> 38:41.377
Hey, guys.

38:46.295 --> 38:50.764
Spyder? Hey, Spyder, it's me,
Steve, you remember?

38:53.695 --> 38:57.861
I felt really bad about crashing the car
through your garage door.

38:57.961 --> 39:00.497
Brought you this delicious basket of muf...

39:09.395 --> 39:14.010
You got some grande fucking cojones
showing your face around here again, bro.

39:16.278 --> 39:19.526
- What time is it?
- Time to fuck you up again, yo.

39:27.728 --> 39:29.776
That fucker knocked himself out.

39:35.128 --> 39:36.710
Mmm.

39:37.895 --> 39:40.296
Hey, what is this?

39:41.195 --> 39:43.061
Banana walnut.

39:43.461 --> 39:45.978
It's got a hint of cinnamon, yo.

39:47.162 --> 39:49.244
<i>So, why you here, loco?</i>

39:50.795 --> 39:52.668
There's this girl.

39:53.287 --> 39:56.360
It's my niece, Taylor, just turned 15.

39:56.460 --> 40:00.595
She's a sweet girl. Does good in school,
she's smart, she's happy, she's funny.

40:00.695 --> 40:03.429
Out of nowhere,
her dad picks up and takes off.

40:03.528 --> 40:05.995
Just goes to try and find himself,
whatever that means.

40:06.095 --> 40:09.895
So now, I just... I look after
Taylor and her mom, Katey.

40:09.995 --> 40:13.545
- What the fuck this gotta do with anything?
- Let him finish.

40:13.837 --> 40:15.658
Go, bro.

40:15.758 --> 40:18.217
Last night, their house got robbed.

40:18.996 --> 40:22.962
They took that TV,
that stereo system and that Xbox.

40:23.262 --> 40:26.744
But the most important thing
that they took was my dog.

40:27.129 --> 40:28.695
Buddy.

40:28.865 --> 40:30.795
- This dog?
- That is my dog.

40:30.895 --> 40:33.629
I didn't steal this dog, okay?
I didn't steal this dog.

40:33.729 --> 40:35.578
Shut up.

40:36.128 --> 40:38.767
Yo, we didn't steal no dog.

40:39.592 --> 40:41.695
- The dog was a gift.
- Uh-huh.

40:41.795 --> 40:45.603
Nevertheless, this dog
is the only thing that my niece...

40:45.703 --> 40:47.777
...gets any comfort from.

40:52.029 --> 40:54.648
- So, you want the dog back?
- I'm not giving you the dog back!

40:54.748 --> 40:57.728
- Shut up.
- It's the only thing I want.

40:57.828 --> 41:00.528
<i>Okay then, ese. You can have the dog back.</i>

41:00.628 --> 41:03.277
- No!
- Yes.

41:05.695 --> 41:07.895
It's only gonna cost you $3,000.

41:07.995 --> 41:10.428
- $3,000?
- $4,000.

41:10.528 --> 41:12.696
- You just said, $3,000.
- You just fucked up my window.

41:12.796 --> 41:16.094
<i>- You gave that dog to me.
- CÃ¡llate.</i>

41:19.261 --> 41:23.642
You give me four grand for the car,
the window and the garage...

41:23.742 --> 41:27.373
<i>...and I'll throw the dog in because
the story of the little niÃ±a...</i>

41:27.472 --> 41:29.196
...touched my heart, bro.

41:29.296 --> 41:32.896
- I don't have that kind of money.
- Then I'll fucking kill you.

41:32.996 --> 41:36.530
- Then I can get it.
- You got 24 hours, Holmes.

41:37.888 --> 41:39.948
That's my dog, Spyder.

41:56.762 --> 42:01.695
<i>Ah, Yuri, Venice's local loan shark
and ruthless son of a bitch.</i>

42:01.795 --> 42:05.728
<i>Everybody knows, he is the last person
you want to borrow money from.</i>

42:05.828 --> 42:09.196
<i>He's also the last person you want
to see on a beach wearing a bikini.</i>

42:09.296 --> 42:10.662
I love this country.

42:10.862 --> 42:13.263
<i>He only gives you a day to pay him back.</i>

42:13.362 --> 42:18.029
<i>What kind of person borrows money from a guy
who only gives you a day to pay him back?</i>

42:18.129 --> 42:19.929
How's it going, Yuri?

42:20.029 --> 42:22.233
Eh, it takes patience.

42:22.333 --> 42:26.006
So, how much money you looking for?

42:26.561 --> 42:30.395
- $5,000.
- On the phone you said, $4,000.

42:30.495 --> 42:34.913
I figured if I ask for four,
I should probably ask for five. Right?

42:35.728 --> 42:38.595
So, how you figure
on paying this monies back?

42:38.695 --> 42:41.385
Yuri, it's me, Steve,
you know I'm good for it.

42:41.485 --> 42:45.538
Whoa, oh, oh! Wait, wait, wait.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.821
- Huh!
- A Casio!

42:48.921 --> 42:51.368
I need this, I'm awful with time.

42:53.062 --> 42:58.271
Listen, you ever heard
of the, uh, Belarus Bowtie?

42:59.395 --> 43:01.628
First you cut off the testicles...

43:02.228 --> 43:04.496
...then you shove them down throat.

43:05.895 --> 43:09.314
Then you have incision here and here.

43:09.414 --> 43:13.433
You pop the balls out and it looks like a...

43:13.533 --> 43:17.011
- Bowtie?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very formal.

43:18.096 --> 43:21.795
Listen, Stevie, I like you, you're funny.

43:21.895 --> 43:23.928
I loan you money...

43:24.058 --> 43:27.863
...but you pay me back
or you have scrotum bowtie.

43:27.963 --> 43:29.544
"Ponimayu?"

43:31.328 --> 43:32.902
Da.

43:33.002 --> 43:35.696
- Scrotum Bowtie.
- Mm-hm.

43:36.295 --> 43:37.929
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

43:38.029 --> 43:39.385
See you soon.

43:44.129 --> 43:45.328
So, Steve...

43:45.428 --> 43:49.052
...I just got off the phone with my brokers
and it turns out that the Chinese group...

43:49.152 --> 43:53.062
...that's interested in buying my apartment
complex is getting a little skittish...

43:53.162 --> 43:55.578
- ...about the graffiti situation.
- Yeah...

43:55.678 --> 43:57.976
...the graffiti situation
is getting skittishy.

43:58.076 --> 44:01.562
They're cutting their offer by half, Steve.

44:01.662 --> 44:05.862
So, here's the thing, okay? You find
this graffiti kid in the next two days...

44:05.962 --> 44:08.428
...and you guarantee me no graffiti
through the end of escrow...

44:08.528 --> 44:11.562
...and I will sell you this house
for what I paid for it.

44:11.662 --> 44:14.166
- That's really generous, Lew.
- Mm-hm, it is.

44:14.266 --> 44:18.227
Look, the way I see it, you're probably
looking at a loss of eight figures...

44:18.327 --> 44:22.461
...if I don't find this guy. But if you
don't want my help, I understand.

44:22.561 --> 44:25.995
- I'm sure you...
- Okay, okay, yeah, I get it, okay.

44:26.494 --> 44:28.625
Find the guy and I'll give you
the fuckin' house!

44:28.725 --> 44:33.096
You see? Give, take, and everybody's happy.

44:33.196 --> 44:37.644
I'm not happy. This is not happy.
Catch the fucker.

44:48.662 --> 44:52.129
Steve? Hi, it's John,
sorry to leave this on your voicemail...

44:52.228 --> 44:57.027
...but I'm just looking at a picture of
one of the murals from Lew's building...

44:58.073 --> 45:00.595
...and, okay, yes...

45:00.695 --> 45:04.162
...I give the piece as a whole,
seven out of ten.

45:04.261 --> 45:07.163
The scrotum shading, the veins...

45:07.262 --> 45:10.930
...and it's like the whole thing
just follows you.

45:11.729 --> 45:13.562
So, here's what I'm gonna do.

45:13.662 --> 45:16.092
<i>I'm gonna go to all
the local art galleries...</i>

45:16.191 --> 45:20.796
<i>...show them the picture,
just try to absorb as much cock as I can.</i>

45:21.495 --> 45:23.378
In, uh...

45:24.003 --> 45:27.227
...ocularly, through my eyes, not...

45:27.727 --> 45:32.295
All right, well... I'm gonna go hop on
this and I'll check in with you later.

45:32.395 --> 45:35.442
Jesus, man, that was bad.

45:44.461 --> 45:48.758
Hey, uh... I'm wondering
if I can ask you about an artist.

45:48.858 --> 45:51.295
- Sure.
- Okay.

45:51.895 --> 45:55.428
I gotta warn you, it's a little racy.

45:55.528 --> 45:59.295
Ah, yes! Salvatore Lopez, that's the artist.

45:59.395 --> 46:02.095
- Salvatore Lopez, are you sure?
- I'm positive.

46:02.194 --> 46:04.266
- You sure?
- Yes.

46:04.366 --> 46:07.895
Look, you see how the veins follow you?

46:07.995 --> 46:10.828
- Yes, I do.
- It's him.

46:10.928 --> 46:13.295
And the, uh, scrotal shading, it's...

46:13.395 --> 46:15.528
I mean, it's classic Salvatore. Perfect.

46:15.628 --> 46:17.595
- Classic Salvatore?
- Absolutely, yes.

46:17.695 --> 46:20.062
Classic Salvatore... where can I find him?

46:20.161 --> 46:22.529
- Hm, why?
- Just 'cause I'm a big fan...

46:22.629 --> 46:25.261
...and I'm actually looking
to commission a mural.

46:25.361 --> 46:28.640
Okay, well, leave me your number,
I'll see what I can do.

46:31.495 --> 46:35.328
Hey, Spyder, got it, four grand.

46:35.728 --> 46:38.611
Four grand. Where's my dog?

46:40.895 --> 46:44.161
Bad news, fucker. Your dog's gone.

46:44.261 --> 46:46.395
Gone? How gone?

46:46.495 --> 46:48.962
All the way gone. Lupe, that bitch, took him.

46:49.062 --> 46:51.207
What are you talking about.
You just took my money!

46:51.307 --> 46:53.583
This was for the car,
the window and the garage.

46:53.683 --> 46:55.900
I was gonna throw the little dog in for free.

46:57.595 --> 47:01.764
You think I'm some kind of fucking idiot?
Get me my dog or I'm gonna go crazy!

47:06.728 --> 47:10.505
- The dog's just gone, is that it!
- Hey, bro? Bro?

47:11.272 --> 47:14.148
Don't think I don't have
fucking nice people in my house!

47:14.248 --> 47:16.958
- You really are crazy.
- They've been to places that you've never been to!

47:17.057 --> 47:20.121
- I can see that, fucker.
- A lot of mental illness!

47:20.221 --> 47:23.435
- Hey, that's Taylor's TV, bro.
- What about Taylor?

47:23.535 --> 47:28.010
- What about Taylor!
- Yo. That's your little niece's TV, bro.

47:30.195 --> 47:31.911
Take a breath, bro.

47:37.928 --> 47:42.495
Listen, that bitch Lupe took your dog, hm?

47:42.595 --> 47:45.028
And a briefcase filled with my cocaine.

47:45.728 --> 47:49.994
You find her, you get my shit,
I'll give you your money back.

47:52.094 --> 47:53.937
How about this?

47:54.534 --> 47:57.712
How about I find your girl...

47:57.812 --> 48:00.781
...and your briefcase full of cocaine...

48:00.881 --> 48:02.760
...and you pay me triple the money.

48:02.860 --> 48:04.377
Pfft!

48:08.728 --> 48:12.930
Deal, fucker. But you better do it now,
before my drugs find a new distributor.

48:13.029 --> 48:15.445
- I'll get right on it.
- Listen...

48:15.545 --> 48:18.376
...wherever this bitch is,
your dog's there, too.

48:23.428 --> 48:25.528
What? She likes Knott's Berry Farms, Holmes.

48:25.628 --> 48:28.161
Knott's Berry Farm's been closed
for a long time, hasn't it?

48:28.261 --> 48:32.228
No, it's still open. That other bitch
in that picture is her sister, Consuela...

48:32.328 --> 48:35.428
<i>...she sometimes hangs out
at my cousin's bar, La Patronca.</i>

48:35.528 --> 48:37.461
Got an address on that?

48:37.960 --> 48:39.878
Fuckin' Google it, Holmes.

48:40.834 --> 48:43.328
<i>I need you to run
some recon for me. Okay, pal?</i>

48:43.428 --> 48:47.061
<i>The bar is La Patronca,
we're looking for a girl named Consuela.</i>

48:47.161 --> 48:50.629
<i>We find out where's she's staying,
and that will lead us to Lupe and the coke.</i>

48:50.729 --> 48:54.009
<i>And, John, try not to stand out, okay?</i>

49:06.961 --> 49:11.609
Hector! Goddammit, what'd I tell you,
you're not a fucking DJ!

49:18.395 --> 49:22.397
Hey there, amigo.
Uh, quite a place you got here.

49:22.497 --> 49:24.357
Really nice. Um...

49:24.457 --> 49:29.281
<i>...to start, I would like one of
your finest cervezas, por favor.</i>

49:29.381 --> 49:34.210
I believe $2.00 should do it.
I don't want no gringo prices.

49:44.761 --> 49:46.593
Oh, my.

49:47.961 --> 49:50.209
Nice boots.

49:50.461 --> 49:53.077
Oh, thank you, thank you so much.

49:58.728 --> 50:00.470
Ah, you can keep the change.

50:02.628 --> 50:04.652
I'm also, uh...

50:05.124 --> 50:08.810
...I'm hoping you know something
about this girl right here.

50:16.061 --> 50:19.994
- Jesus.
- Why you asking? You a cop?

50:20.094 --> 50:24.876
No, no, I'm not a cop. No, no, no,
I'm just a friend, I'm just looking for her.

50:26.594 --> 50:29.009
She messing with you, too?

50:30.360 --> 50:35.043
No, not that I know of. No, it's nothing
personal, I just wanna talk to her.

50:36.661 --> 50:39.576
Okay... just had to check.

50:40.028 --> 50:41.829
Her name's Consuela.

50:42.328 --> 50:46.038
She lives at the Hollywood Premiere Motel
with her sister, Lupe.

50:47.527 --> 50:50.253
Oh, oh, wow, okay, uh...

50:50.353 --> 50:53.961
...great, that was a lot easier
than I thought it would be.

50:54.061 --> 50:56.343
<i>Thank you, uh, gracias.</i>

50:59.461 --> 51:01.961
Oh, he spit that pit on your floor.

51:02.061 --> 51:03.796
Uh, you know what...

51:03.895 --> 51:07.120
...that is legitimately
all I needed to know, so...

51:07.220 --> 51:11.228
...all right, I'm gonna let you keep that
and thank you so much for your time.

51:11.827 --> 51:16.167
You can actually have the beer,
that's for you, my tip.

51:16.267 --> 51:18.954
- Thanks.
- Be careful!

51:19.234 --> 51:21.582
- She plays mind games.
- Okay.

51:21.682 --> 51:24.828
- Takes hours to respond to texts.
- Oh, hello.

51:24.928 --> 51:28.162
One of the most annoying things
is that she'll make plans...

51:28.262 --> 51:30.495
...and then cancel them, day of.

51:31.094 --> 51:34.914
She'll invite you over to watch a movie
and then just wanna watch a movie!

51:35.014 --> 51:38.099
- Okay. Okay, I really, I gotta get going.
- Oh, and she's a Capricorn.

51:38.199 --> 51:40.041
Yo, if you find her...

51:40.141 --> 51:43.971
...tell her Rigaberto is thinking about her.

51:44.071 --> 51:47.498
I will. Good day, gentlemen.

51:48.462 --> 51:52.345
<i>So, after my stellar detective work,
I pointed Steve in the direction...</i>

51:52.445 --> 51:57.109
<i>...of the Hollywood Premiere Motel
where Consuela was known to frequent.</i>

52:03.494 --> 52:06.243
Damn! Oh, my God.

52:10.760 --> 52:14.842
Hey, baby, I'm Mocha. You looking for a date?

52:16.260 --> 52:19.094
I... uh... I don't think so.

52:19.194 --> 52:22.643
What... you some kind of fag
or something, sweetie?

52:23.527 --> 52:25.809
No! What would... how...

52:27.561 --> 52:29.260
Mocha...

52:29.360 --> 52:31.448
...maybe you could help me.

52:32.662 --> 52:35.528
Have you seen this girl right here?

52:36.127 --> 52:38.361
What kind of Annie Oakley bullshit is that?

52:38.461 --> 52:42.860
Some kind of bullshit Knott's
Berry Farm picture. I don't know.

52:43.460 --> 52:46.328
Well, that one's Lupe, I've seen her.

52:46.428 --> 52:50.028
- Room 216.
- You didn't see a little dog, too, did you?

52:50.128 --> 52:52.595
Oh, that dog's got some bowel problems.

52:52.695 --> 52:55.295
- He doesn't have any bowel problems.
- He shits fuckin' everywhere!

52:55.395 --> 52:58.406
- It's a nervous disorder.
- Whatever.

52:59.295 --> 53:03.548
Now, if you change your mind...
Mocha will turn you out.

53:03.648 --> 53:05.062
I will noodle on that.

53:05.162 --> 53:08.195
Oh, I'm gonna noodle on you. Trust me.

53:09.294 --> 53:11.336
You cute.

53:11.994 --> 53:15.726
Okay, so, it is 8:36 p.m.

53:15.826 --> 53:19.295
I've got my stakeout provisions acquired.

53:19.894 --> 53:24.694
- I am headed to the lookout spot right now.
- Time to kick the tires and light the fire.

53:24.794 --> 53:26.027
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:26.127 --> 53:28.451
- John, right? Hi.
- Yeah, hi.

53:28.551 --> 53:32.695
- I'm John, my name's John. Hello.
- I know, we've met. I just said your name.

53:32.795 --> 53:37.195
Yeah, I'm sorry, I remember you, I'm just...
I'm not used to people remembering me.

53:37.295 --> 53:40.561
Well, how could I forget a guy
who followed me down a dark alley?

53:40.660 --> 53:43.660
I should have finished the job,
killed you there.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.128
Sorry, I wouldn't kill you.

53:45.228 --> 53:48.462
By the way,
were you just talking to yourself?

53:48.861 --> 53:53.228
Yeah... no... no, I was talking
into my phone here.

53:53.328 --> 53:55.128
- I take field notes.
- Cool.

53:55.228 --> 53:58.467
- Yeah.
- So are you following someone tonight?

54:02.058 --> 54:05.195
Actually, yes. I probably
shouldn't be mentioning this...

54:05.295 --> 54:09.295
...but, yeah, I got
a pretty sweet case going on.

54:09.395 --> 54:12.741
I'm following a graffiti artist
by the name of Salvatore Lopez.

54:12.841 --> 54:15.627
- Salvatore Lopez?
- Could be "SalvatorÃ©", I don't really know.

54:15.727 --> 54:19.362
- I love him.
- You do? You know him?

54:19.462 --> 54:22.861
Yeah, of course,
he's like the Banksy of Venice.

54:22.961 --> 54:25.827
- Right.
- I would love to see what he looks like.

54:25.927 --> 54:29.571
- You and me both.
- Do you want some company?

54:32.327 --> 54:35.262
Yes, but you know it's just...

54:35.362 --> 54:38.394
...I mean, it's a stakeout,
it's sitting in a car.

54:38.494 --> 54:40.328
I don't mind.

54:41.327 --> 54:42.896
Okay.

54:43.492 --> 54:45.837
You have a very low bar for a fun evening.

54:46.461 --> 54:50.661
Okay, my turn.
Fuck, marry, kill, Ellen DeGeneres...

54:50.761 --> 54:53.528
...Oprah or Kelly Ripa?

54:53.627 --> 54:56.879
Okay, uh, well, I'd fuck Oprah...

54:56.979 --> 54:59.990
...because she's beautiful,
she's a national treasure...

55:00.090 --> 55:04.061
...and if I do it right, I'll get a car!

55:04.161 --> 55:07.495
Look under your seats!
Then I guess I'd marry Ellen...

55:07.594 --> 55:10.761
...just because of the sense of humor,
you gotta want that in a wife.

55:10.861 --> 55:14.295
And she's got an endless supply
of sneakers and suits.

55:14.395 --> 55:17.295
- That's true.
- And will dance the day away.

55:17.395 --> 55:21.069
And then, I guess, I'd have to kill Kelly.

55:21.821 --> 55:25.418
Sweet, sweet Ripa. Only because...

55:25.518 --> 55:28.028
...that's the nature of the game,
and someone's gotta die.

55:28.128 --> 55:32.394
It would probably scar me for life,
it would ruin my marriage with Ellen, so...

55:32.494 --> 55:34.310
That's fair.

55:38.095 --> 55:43.161
It's so crazy to me that you, uh,
that you know Salvatore Lopez, that's...

55:43.261 --> 55:46.894
Yeah, he's great, I mean,
I love the way he combines...

55:46.994 --> 55:50.228
...the Japanese theory of Shuko
with a street-style aesthetic.

55:50.328 --> 55:52.195
Yes, yes.

55:52.295 --> 55:57.408
Plus, his intimate knowledge with
the male anatomy. It's very sensual.

55:57.508 --> 56:00.329
- And the way the veins follow your eyes.
- Yeah, yeah.

56:00.429 --> 56:03.127
- And the scrotal shading.
- Shut up.

56:07.261 --> 56:09.820
You know, you're kind of cute.

56:12.161 --> 56:15.362
Well, I've been told I'm a bit
of a young Roger Daltrey...

56:15.462 --> 56:17.776
...if he spent a lot of time with computers.

56:32.860 --> 56:34.727
Oh, John.

57:00.328 --> 57:05.061
- Ooh, it's my little noodle.
- Hey. Mm-mm. Ladies.

57:05.161 --> 57:07.077
I like watching you walk away.

57:46.693 --> 57:49.461
Buddy! Aw, man, come on.

57:49.561 --> 57:52.427
There you go. Did you miss me?

57:52.527 --> 57:56.044
Aw, come here, pal... take a little rest.

58:01.394 --> 58:03.794
What do you think you're doing
in my girl Lupe's room?

58:03.894 --> 58:06.110
Dog walker... they didn't tell you?

58:07.861 --> 58:10.910
You don't look like no dog walker to me.

58:12.094 --> 58:13.676
Really?

58:15.894 --> 58:17.776
That's all you got, baby?

58:23.894 --> 58:26.494
See, I came to this town with a dream...

58:26.594 --> 58:29.476
...make-up artist to all the stars and shit.

58:31.128 --> 58:33.728
Then I got side-tracked when I met Henry.

58:33.828 --> 58:36.727
He was sweet as molasses.

58:36.827 --> 58:40.475
He took good care of me.
Loved me for what I was.

58:42.661 --> 58:44.728
Good man like that's hard to find.

58:44.828 --> 58:46.643
Don't I know it, girl.

58:48.427 --> 58:50.328
What happened to him?

58:50.427 --> 58:52.277
Oh, I killed him.

58:55.527 --> 58:58.328
There... what do you think, sugar?

58:58.927 --> 59:02.576
- I feel really special.
- Yeah, I knew you would.

59:05.278 --> 59:06.858
Whew!

59:07.405 --> 59:09.422
You know what I think is next?

59:10.027 --> 59:11.876
A ride home?

59:15.694 --> 59:17.830
We gonna have to give you a shave, baby.

59:21.061 --> 59:22.968
I'll be right back.

59:23.627 --> 59:27.095
Come on, sweetness, let's move
little doggie to the bathroom...

59:27.195 --> 59:29.610
...before it shits all over the bed.

59:41.431 --> 59:44.648
Gonna have some fun... mm-mm-mm.

59:45.661 --> 59:49.460
Now, don't be wiggling around on me
'cause I'd hate to cut off what...

59:49.560 --> 59:52.010
...little you got down there, baby.

01:00:00.394 --> 01:00:03.361
Here you go, Buddy. Here boy,
here you go, pal, come here.

01:00:03.461 --> 01:00:06.228
Come on, let's go. Here we go.

01:00:06.327 --> 01:00:08.910
Get your ass back here now!

01:00:09.794 --> 01:00:11.909
You broke my nose!

01:00:14.665 --> 01:00:16.049
Girls!

01:00:17.128 --> 01:00:19.294
Run, Buddy, I'll find you!

01:00:22.701 --> 01:00:25.776
Come back here! Come back here, motherfucker!

01:00:26.427 --> 01:00:28.309
Let's get him!

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:32.876
Get that motherfucker!

01:00:41.827 --> 01:00:44.661
Come on, girls! Let's get him! Get him!

01:00:44.761 --> 01:00:47.575
We're gonna kick your ass! Open that car!

01:00:47.928 --> 01:00:49.788
Get out of that car right now!

01:00:59.061 --> 01:01:00.910
He was kinda cute.

01:01:13.895 --> 01:01:15.394
Hey.

01:01:16.194 --> 01:01:19.128
- Hello.
- Hey, fellas, how you doing?

01:01:19.227 --> 01:01:21.961
You borrow money, you pay money back.

01:01:22.061 --> 01:01:23.561
- Yeah, of course I do.
- So?

01:01:23.661 --> 01:01:27.143
- You gave me a week.
- No, it's a day.

01:01:29.161 --> 01:01:32.674
- Yeah, but it's a week though, right?
- It's always a day.

01:01:33.243 --> 01:01:35.894
- It's one day, no?
- It's always been a day.

01:01:35.994 --> 01:01:38.297
Mm... nice lipstick.

01:01:38.397 --> 01:01:41.794
Oh, yeah, it's my girlfriend's lipstick.

01:01:41.894 --> 01:01:44.408
Brings out the color in your eyes.

01:01:44.928 --> 01:01:46.928
- So, a day?
- One day.

01:01:47.028 --> 01:01:48.959
All right.

01:01:51.161 --> 01:01:53.810
Remind him of the due date, huh?

01:01:59.861 --> 01:02:03.394
I'm pretty sure that's you, Lew,
I just don't know what happened to you.

01:02:03.494 --> 01:02:07.327
I'm running out of time, okay? The Chinese
are coming to visit the building tomorrow.

01:02:07.427 --> 01:02:09.861
<i>It's a Lucha Libre wrestler...</i>

01:02:09.961 --> 01:02:13.461
...and I think he's tea-bagging you, Lew.

01:02:13.561 --> 01:02:15.227
I'm gonna lose the sale, okay?

01:02:15.327 --> 01:02:18.995
Everything I worked for, for fuck's sake!
You said you were gonna take care of this!

01:02:19.095 --> 01:02:21.746
- I got it, I got it. I'll take care of it.
- Okay? All right?

01:02:21.846 --> 01:02:24.062
- Jesus Christ.
- Jesus Christ.

01:02:24.161 --> 01:02:25.638
Hey...

01:02:25.738 --> 01:02:29.812
...Lew, you think you could...
loan me $5,000?

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:33.828
You want me to lend you... fuck you! Steve!

01:02:33.928 --> 01:02:36.028
And what happened to you?

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:38.527
You were supposed to take care of this.

01:02:38.627 --> 01:02:43.709
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry,
I got, uh... distracted.

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:50.028
- Just go find the graffiti artist.
- It's very creative.

01:02:50.127 --> 01:02:53.376
I've never even imagined
tea-bagging someone like that.

01:02:54.794 --> 01:02:56.327
I'll...

01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:22.110
Hey, Dave.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.628
You're drinking alone and the sun's still up.

01:03:26.627 --> 01:03:28.747
I've been evicted from my own house.

01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:31.427
Ah, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:03:31.727 --> 01:03:33.794
You know I'm there for you.

01:03:34.461 --> 01:03:35.527
I know.

01:03:35.627 --> 01:03:38.260
Promise me that you'll let me be there.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.930
Fine.

01:03:40.672 --> 01:03:42.476
I'll let you be there.

01:03:47.727 --> 01:03:51.164
Listen, I count on you
to be the ballast in my life.

01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:55.459
I need you to turn this thing around.

01:03:55.559 --> 01:03:57.390
I'm there for you.

01:03:58.627 --> 01:04:03.042
So, about that five grand plus interest
I need, so Yuri doesn't kill me.

01:04:07.961 --> 01:04:10.396
From the closing sale at the shop.

01:04:11.694 --> 01:04:15.451
<i>- Oh, wow.
- Mi dinero es su dinero.</i>

01:04:15.961 --> 01:04:18.994
Thanks, man. Thank you.

01:04:19.393 --> 01:04:21.394
Really, thank you.

01:04:22.093 --> 01:04:26.110
- So, you are learning to let go?
- I'm letting go, all right.

01:04:27.661 --> 01:04:29.164
Here...

01:04:29.644 --> 01:04:31.661
...crash at my place.

01:04:31.761 --> 01:04:34.209
Yeah. Thanks.

01:04:41.327 --> 01:04:44.361
- Hey, Yuri.
- Hey.

01:04:44.761 --> 01:04:47.461
Thank you very much, very much.

01:04:47.561 --> 01:04:50.527
You're welcome.
You're a man of your word, huh?

01:04:50.627 --> 01:04:52.727
You, too. I appreciate it.

01:04:52.827 --> 01:04:56.761
Listen, don't borrow any money from me, huh?

01:04:56.861 --> 01:04:59.403
- It's dangerous.
- Right.

01:04:59.503 --> 01:05:01.042
- Thank you.
- All right, thanks again.

01:05:01.142 --> 01:05:02.988
Come on, ladies.

01:05:08.127 --> 01:05:10.827
Hey, Steve? Hey, hold on.

01:05:10.927 --> 01:05:13.477
Hold on. Wait for it.

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:16.466
Yes, I got him! I got Salvatore.

01:05:16.566 --> 01:05:18.554
<i>- What?
- Yeah, I was looking right at him.</i>

01:05:18.654 --> 01:05:23.862
Uh... and... just... I don't know if this
changes anything, but he's not Latino.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.806
Well, 'cause Salvatore Lopez, right?

01:05:26.906 --> 01:05:30.627
- But he's not, he's black.
- All right, I'll see you in a little bit.

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:33.949
No, that doesn't make me a racist,
I just thought you might...

01:05:34.049 --> 01:05:36.928
...I'll be here. Jesus.

01:05:49.627 --> 01:05:51.504
You must be Salvatore.

01:05:52.487 --> 01:05:54.974
Yeah. So?

01:05:56.293 --> 01:05:58.494
How much does this one go for?

01:05:58.594 --> 01:06:00.294
$10,000.

01:06:00.394 --> 01:06:04.594
I'll tell you what, I'll give you five dollars
for this and keep you from going to jail.

01:06:05.093 --> 01:06:07.828
Jail? Man, I think you
should get the fuck out of here.

01:06:07.927 --> 01:06:09.975
What's that? What's that?

01:06:10.777 --> 01:06:12.593
Hold still, jerkoff.

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:17.127
You painted the top of my head blue.
You remember?

01:06:17.227 --> 01:06:19.456
Now you're gonna tell me everything you know.

01:06:26.027 --> 01:06:29.476
Hey, fuck you, man.
This paint don't come off.

01:06:34.094 --> 01:06:38.060
What... what... what'd you write on his face?

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.927
- Or did you just stomp him?
- Dude, what is with you and all the violence?

01:06:42.027 --> 01:06:43.861
Aw, shit.

01:06:44.201 --> 01:06:46.360
Hey, look who it is.

01:06:47.159 --> 01:06:49.193
<i>What's up, cholos?</i>

01:06:49.593 --> 01:06:52.959
- Where's my shit?
- Yeah, where's his shit?

01:06:53.059 --> 01:06:55.594
Dude, I'm standing right here.

01:06:55.694 --> 01:06:57.662
- I can hear every word he says.
- Shut the fuck up!

01:06:57.762 --> 01:06:59.828
- Hey, hey, don't talk to him like that.
- You shut the fuck up!

01:06:59.927 --> 01:07:01.450
I'm cool. We're all good.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:05.108
- You and your dog's time is running out.
- You didn't find Lupe yet, did you?

01:07:05.208 --> 01:07:07.953
You're the one that's supposed
to be looking. I want my shit back!

01:07:08.053 --> 01:07:10.114
I want my dog back.

01:07:10.214 --> 01:07:12.230
Whoa, jeez.

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:15.961
- Great.
- You got 24 hours, Holmes.

01:07:16.561 --> 01:07:19.605
- I'm gonna come find you.
- Have fun.

01:07:19.894 --> 01:07:21.807
You probably don't care but, um...

01:07:21.906 --> 01:07:25.927
...you're saying, "24," but your hands
are actually saying, "42."

01:07:27.226 --> 01:07:30.321
I know when I do my gang gestures,
I like to practice in the mirror.

01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:34.042
See this watch? This watch is shit.
Fuck your watch!

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.810
What's the matter with you?

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.327
You might want to get out
of the house once in a while.

01:08:02.427 --> 01:08:04.361
I know.

01:08:04.461 --> 01:08:06.260
What are you doing?

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.961
I gotta go steal back some drugs for these
gang guys, so I can get my dog back.

01:08:10.061 --> 01:08:13.727
But first I gotta go shake up
these real estate assholes.

01:08:13.826 --> 01:08:15.661
Cool.

01:08:15.761 --> 01:08:19.754
- Wanna come?
- Yeah! Sounds like fun.

01:08:19.853 --> 01:08:21.875
Could be dangerous.

01:08:23.027 --> 01:08:24.644
Maybe I'll die.

01:08:31.792 --> 01:08:35.661
- Hi, we're here to see Mr. Carter.
- Do you have an appointment?

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.595
No, just tell him we represent Lew the Jew.

01:08:39.694 --> 01:08:42.948
- Lew the Jew?
- Lew the Jew.

01:08:43.048 --> 01:08:46.475
- Hurry up.
- Just a moment.

01:08:47.627 --> 01:08:50.581
- Hurry up?
- No more patience.

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:53.194
Have a mint.

01:08:53.694 --> 01:08:58.551
- How can I help you, gentlemen?
- You are so fucked.

01:09:00.893 --> 01:09:03.126
I'm sorry, excuse me?

01:09:03.225 --> 01:09:05.627
This about money? It's always about money.

01:09:05.727 --> 01:09:08.194
It's Lew the Jew, come on,
you need a few bucks?

01:09:08.294 --> 01:09:10.560
No, don't need money.

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:15.197
But here is the deal we are gonna make you.
You are gonna make Lew the Jew...

01:09:15.296 --> 01:09:19.859
...a very generous offer for all the shit
that you've done to his apartment building.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.594
We were thinking $22 million.

01:09:23.393 --> 01:09:25.227
22... $22 million?

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:30.004
And you are gonna give
Dave here a brand new condo.

01:09:30.594 --> 01:09:33.027
One bedroom and a den.

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:35.594
Right on the beach, for free.

01:09:35.694 --> 01:09:39.861
Okay, this, uh... is a moment for
me to call the police. Excuse me.

01:09:39.961 --> 01:09:42.693
Oh, good, well, you can show them this...

01:09:42.792 --> 01:09:45.859
...because right there, that is a signed...

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.453
- Notarized.
- Sworn affidavit...

01:09:48.554 --> 01:09:50.794
...by a Salvatore Lopez...

01:09:50.894 --> 01:09:55.594
...the graffiti artist that you hired to
paint all over Lew the Jew's buildings...

01:09:55.693 --> 01:09:59.594
...so the Chinese would drop
their offer and you could buy for less.

01:09:59.693 --> 01:10:00.840
So, we have a deal, right?

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:04.576
Or am I gonna have to put your head
through that fucking wall?

01:10:10.527 --> 01:10:13.461
There, there you go, fellas.
You have a good day, all right?

01:10:13.561 --> 01:10:15.375
Bye, bye.

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:36.894
You're short.

01:10:36.994 --> 01:10:38.994
- What?
- You're short.

01:10:39.094 --> 01:10:41.433
That's all Prince gave me for that stuff.

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:44.904
I swear.

01:10:45.793 --> 01:10:48.009
Oscar, I would never lie to you.

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:57.340
I gotta get back to Spyder's
before he suspects anything.

01:11:00.826 --> 01:11:03.308
What happens if Spyder finds out?

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.642
Fuck Spyder.

01:11:10.324 --> 01:11:14.090
- Where are you taking my dog?
- I found him out back. He's my dog now.

01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.660
- What?
- Just stay here.

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.636
<i>Pinche loco.</i>

01:11:27.327 --> 01:11:28.673
Time to go.

01:11:29.792 --> 01:11:32.753
Fuck Oscar and fuck Spyder.

01:11:43.127 --> 01:11:44.662
Bonus!

01:11:45.484 --> 01:11:48.202
- What gives?
- Some "just in case" stuff.

01:11:48.522 --> 01:11:50.403
I guess.

01:11:53.194 --> 01:11:55.960
Wow, where'd you get this? Some drug lord?

01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.993
Nah. You remember Dana Kaminski?

01:11:59.093 --> 01:12:01.461
- Yeah.
- Well, her old man was a cop.

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.060
Sweet.

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.494
- Grenade?
- Yeah.

01:12:04.593 --> 01:12:07.075
- Cool.
- Thank you.

01:12:07.826 --> 01:12:09.884
- Knuckle duster?
- Yep.

01:12:10.094 --> 01:12:12.872
- Ninja throwing star?
- Yeah.

01:12:13.893 --> 01:12:15.959
You sure you want to do this?

01:12:16.059 --> 01:12:18.793
What else have I got to do? I'm with you.

01:12:18.893 --> 01:12:21.552
To the hounds. Nice.

01:12:52.494 --> 01:12:55.110
- You got a flat tire.
- What?

01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:57.060
Are you kidding me?

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:02.194
- Well, fix the fucking thing.
- Gigi don't fix no tires. Shit.

01:13:02.294 --> 01:13:05.993
Fix the fucking thing or we're gonna be late.

01:13:06.559 --> 01:13:09.161
- Fine.
- Hurry up, okay?

01:13:09.261 --> 01:13:11.227
Hurry up. Bitch.

01:13:11.327 --> 01:13:14.009
- What?
- You heard me.

01:13:20.461 --> 01:13:22.176
Awesome.

01:13:23.826 --> 01:13:26.276
What the hell's taking so long, girl?

01:13:29.626 --> 01:13:32.666
- I'll take that.
- Okay.

01:13:33.526 --> 01:13:35.260
Where's my dog?

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.451
Spyder has him.

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.642
I swear.

01:13:41.194 --> 01:13:45.593
Hi, I'm Dave. I just electrocuted
the shit out of your friend.

01:13:45.693 --> 01:13:48.140
He's taking a little nap in the trunk.

01:13:48.539 --> 01:13:52.353
I want you to try these bracelets on.
They're free.

01:14:01.626 --> 01:14:04.860
- Where's the rest of the coke?
- That's all there was.

01:14:05.959 --> 01:14:09.559
Ooh, a shot to the knee cap,
that's... that's gonna hurt.

01:14:09.659 --> 01:14:13.960
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
I sold it to this guy, black dude, Prince.

01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:16.726
Where can I find him?

01:14:16.826 --> 01:14:20.642
He's always at this bar called Bird Cage.

01:14:26.227 --> 01:14:27.827
You're very cute.

01:14:28.626 --> 01:14:31.194
Where are you going? You can't leave me here!

01:14:31.294 --> 01:14:32.853
Oh, don't worry...

01:14:32.953 --> 01:14:36.559
...we're gonna call the 9-1-1 for you
as soon as we scamper off.

01:14:36.659 --> 01:14:38.526
Enjoy prison.

01:14:38.626 --> 01:14:41.493
<i>What? Pinches gringos!</i>

01:14:41.993 --> 01:14:43.575
Hey!

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.227
Okay, you ready?

01:14:53.327 --> 01:14:56.327
I've got a boner
for the first time in a year.

01:14:57.126 --> 01:15:01.374
I have no... real response to that statement.

01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:05.760
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- Fuck you.

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:08.893
- Is there a cover?
- Fuck you.

01:15:08.993 --> 01:15:10.894
Prince is expecting us.

01:15:11.593 --> 01:15:14.976
- What's in the case?
- A lot of money to buy cocaine.

01:15:19.693 --> 01:15:23.127
I was planning on using that later.
Is there a back door to this place?

01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:25.110
Man, fuck you.

01:15:27.094 --> 01:15:29.327
- Thanks very much.
- You're really good.

01:15:29.426 --> 01:15:31.056
Fuck you.

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.493
Manhattan, neat.

01:15:47.593 --> 01:15:49.442
Vodka tonic.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.242
Do you need me to walk you through that?

01:15:55.726 --> 01:15:58.559
Whoa... not so fast.

01:15:58.659 --> 01:16:00.721
We're here to see Prince.

01:16:00.821 --> 01:16:02.715
Spyder sent us.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.776
Spyder? But Oscar sent
some girl over yesterday.

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.842
Hang on.

01:16:15.927 --> 01:16:19.393
He said they'd see you, but they
hope you know what you're doing.

01:16:19.493 --> 01:16:22.942
- It's that door down at the end of the hall.
- Thanks.

01:16:28.627 --> 01:16:31.260
<i>Prince is a modern-day entrepreneur...</i>

01:16:31.359 --> 01:16:35.827
<i>...money laundering, prostitution,
drug dealing, what doesn't this guy do?</i>

01:16:35.927 --> 01:16:38.209
These two look the fuck out of place.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.688
What the hell are these cats...

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.760
Yo, yo, yo, who the fuck are you?

01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:49.727
- I'm Steve.
- I'm Dave.

01:16:49.827 --> 01:16:52.860
Okay, okay, first thing, you gotta
give me the card for that DJ, man.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.493
He is playing some great music out there.

01:16:55.593 --> 01:16:58.660
Came here to talk to me
about the motherfucking DJ?

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.060
You a crazy motherfucker.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:04.759
All right, well, so enough with
the talking and shit, open the case.

01:17:04.859 --> 01:17:07.860
- Yeah, just show me the stuff.
- Uh, just open the case.

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.864
- Show me the stuff.
- Just open the case.

01:17:09.964 --> 01:17:11.526
- Show us the stuff.
- Open the case.

01:17:11.626 --> 01:17:14.225
- Show us the fucking stuff!
- Motherfucker, open the motherfucking case.

01:17:14.324 --> 01:17:17.027
- Show us the motherfucking stuff!
- Open the motherfucking case, Steve!

01:17:17.127 --> 01:17:20.075
- What are... what are you doing?
- Kill these motherfuckers.

01:17:20.926 --> 01:17:22.395
Shit!

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.927
Now the thing you need to do is
sit there real quiet and just sit back.

01:17:28.027 --> 01:17:30.760
I'm just gonna hold this up to your neck.
Okay, be very cool.

01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:34.205
We're gonna stand up, you ready?
Come on. There you go. Come on.

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:39.759
Shit just got real. You, put
your gun down, put your gun down.

01:17:39.859 --> 01:17:44.109
Take that cocaine,
put it in our case and shut it.

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:50.109
Tick, tick, tick, tick...

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:54.793
Oh, here we go, nice and easy.

01:17:54.893 --> 01:17:57.693
- Nice and easy, watch your step.
- You're in control, boss.

01:17:57.793 --> 01:18:00.060
- Fuck you.
- Dave, you got this?

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:02.625
- I got it.
- Good.

01:18:02.725 --> 01:18:06.574
Easy, don't move,
don't fucking move, you hear me?

01:18:09.693 --> 01:18:11.660
It was nice meeting you, all of you!

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.846
Hold on to this.

01:18:13.946 --> 01:18:16.375
Shit! Oh! Oh, shit!

01:18:22.393 --> 01:18:24.676
Oh, fuck.

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:41.459
The fuck y'all running to?
You motherfuckers fired!

01:18:41.559 --> 01:18:43.808
All of y'all are fired.

01:18:49.626 --> 01:18:51.894
<i>- That's right, it's the Muffin Man.
- You find that cocaine?</i>

01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:54.094
<i>- Just put Spyder on the phone!
- Go fuck yourself!</i>

01:18:54.193 --> 01:18:58.627
No, I will not go fuck myself, Oscar.
Just tell Spyder that I got his coke...

01:18:58.727 --> 01:19:01.426
...and I want my dog and my money, all right?

01:19:01.526 --> 01:19:04.753
So I'll be over there tonight.
All right, goodbye.

01:19:05.626 --> 01:19:06.857
Well, that was easy.

01:19:06.957 --> 01:19:10.243
Yeah, easy getting in,
not so easy getting out.

01:19:10.343 --> 01:19:13.159
- It sure smells like a set-up.
- You got a plan?

01:19:13.559 --> 01:19:15.560
Of course, I got a plan.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.693
You see what's happening here, don't you?

01:19:18.793 --> 01:19:22.330
For the first time in your life,
Katey and Taylor...

01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:26.476
...you're putting them
and their needs before your own.

01:19:27.625 --> 01:19:30.293
Now me, I'm doing the totally opposite thing.

01:19:30.393 --> 01:19:34.675
I'm putting my needs before anyone else's
for the first time in my life.

01:19:36.359 --> 01:19:39.776
I've become you, and you've become me.

01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:45.743
- It's a little right on the nose, isn't it?
- Sure, but I didn't have much time with it.

01:19:48.293 --> 01:19:51.027
Great news! Jesus! It's me, it's okay.

01:19:51.126 --> 01:19:53.359
What the fuck are you doing here, John?

01:19:54.238 --> 01:19:56.442
I have something for you guys.

01:19:58.093 --> 01:19:59.961
Hi, guys.

01:20:01.259 --> 01:20:05.793
Fellas, you're a day early,
the luau has been changed 'til tomorrow.

01:20:05.893 --> 01:20:08.693
- Fuck you!
- Hey, Manu? Just... please.

01:20:08.793 --> 01:20:11.575
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Okay? It's okay.

01:20:12.927 --> 01:20:15.354
Listen, we are here...

01:20:15.454 --> 01:20:18.994
...to apologize to you, Steve
for kicking the shit out of you.

01:20:19.093 --> 01:20:21.475
Yeah, little dude says we should.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.961
Why are you listening to the little dude?

01:20:26.159 --> 01:20:28.241
He's dating our sister.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.392
How many sisters do you have?

01:20:32.492 --> 01:20:34.327
Only one.

01:20:35.426 --> 01:20:39.326
Yeah, yeah, it just happened,
just crazy chemistry...

01:20:39.426 --> 01:20:42.564
...just right off the bat.
Just very... very heated...

01:20:42.664 --> 01:20:45.626
...in a respectable way, just modest...

01:20:45.726 --> 01:20:49.540
- ...modests, hot modests.
- Why didn't you just beat the shit out of him?

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:53.293
- Momma likes him.
- You met Nola's mom?

01:20:53.393 --> 01:20:57.316
Yeah, yeah, uh, just yesterday,
actually... a very lovely lunch.

01:20:57.626 --> 01:21:00.626
Joan... is a wonderful cook.

01:21:01.225 --> 01:21:06.274
And it turns out, we both have
a passion for vintage cinema, so...

01:21:09.726 --> 01:21:12.793
- So we're all good here?
- Yeah, we're cool.

01:21:13.192 --> 01:21:15.822
- And?
- Oh.

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:17.987
We owe you, Steve...

01:21:18.086 --> 01:21:21.542
...and if there's anything you need,
you could come see us.

01:21:23.459 --> 01:21:25.623
What are you guys doing right now?

01:21:25.723 --> 01:21:28.560
<i>I know I'm in the minority here,
but I don't love gun battles...</i>

01:21:28.710 --> 01:21:31.109
<i>...at creepy, drug-cartel trap houses.</i>

01:21:31.209 --> 01:21:35.743
<i>If anything, I'm more of an "au natural,"
hand-to-hand combat kind of guy.</i>

01:21:35.843 --> 01:21:40.316
<i>So, I just sat this one out and headed
back to the office. You know...</i>

01:21:40.416 --> 01:21:42.425
<i>...to do office stuff.</i>

01:21:56.559 --> 01:22:00.293
Here you go, buddy.
Hold tight, okay, come on.

01:22:00.393 --> 01:22:02.621
Ssh, let's get out of here.

01:22:20.025 --> 01:22:21.064
Right?

01:22:24.793 --> 01:22:25.995
Whoa!

01:22:30.793 --> 01:22:33.259
Not much of a plan, if I can say that.

01:22:33.359 --> 01:22:36.860
Stay here with the coke.
I'm gonna try and get Buddy.

01:22:36.959 --> 01:22:38.593
Keep your head down.

01:22:38.693 --> 01:22:40.974
Picked the right man for the job.

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.708
Get some!

01:22:53.959 --> 01:22:55.809
Fuck you.

01:23:01.726 --> 01:23:04.560
- What the fuck, Holmes?
- It's that Muffin motherfucker, man!

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:06.393
He's back, took a shot at me!

01:23:06.493 --> 01:23:09.574
Watch the windows,
I'll find that muffinfucker!

01:23:24.593 --> 01:23:26.461
Drop the gun.

01:23:31.693 --> 01:23:34.977
Does Spyder know you and Lupe
stole all the drugs?

01:23:35.077 --> 01:23:36.837
And you've been fucking her?

01:23:36.936 --> 01:23:38.775
Where's my coke, bitch?

01:23:43.293 --> 01:23:45.546
You lying motherfucker.

01:24:01.926 --> 01:24:03.794
Now what?

01:24:04.393 --> 01:24:07.660
We had a deal... your doggie
and the money for my cocaine.

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.293
- Yeah.
- You got my coke?

01:24:10.393 --> 01:24:12.442
It's on it's way.

01:24:12.542 --> 01:24:14.013
It's okay.

01:24:15.026 --> 01:24:16.694
Bring it on, motherfucker!

01:24:16.794 --> 01:24:19.326
- Dave, Dave!
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:24:19.426 --> 01:24:21.825
I'm completely out of control.

01:24:21.925 --> 01:24:24.528
All right, that's our guy.

01:24:26.526 --> 01:24:28.326
Is that for me?

01:24:28.426 --> 01:24:32.040
Yes, here we go. I got it, I got it.

01:24:37.859 --> 01:24:41.110
Dude... okay. Thank you.

01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:42.742
Mm.

01:24:47.853 --> 01:24:50.042
Hang on to that.

01:25:10.959 --> 01:25:13.660
There he is, come here.

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:16.426
Buddy! I missed you so much!

01:25:17.125 --> 01:25:19.192
You been feeding my dog?

01:25:19.292 --> 01:25:22.059
Pedigree, lamb and rice blend,
he loves that shit.

01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:26.125
Yeah, he does. Thanks for looking after him.

01:25:26.225 --> 01:25:28.026
No problem.

01:25:28.526 --> 01:25:30.774
- We cool?
- Cool.

01:25:31.973 --> 01:25:35.948
- See you down the road, Holmes.
- All right, okay.

01:25:36.726 --> 01:25:38.975
Not a bad fella, that Spyder.

01:25:44.259 --> 01:25:46.660
<i>So, Steve got the job done.</i>

01:25:46.759 --> 01:25:49.326
<i>Was it unorthodox in execution? Sure.</i>

01:25:49.426 --> 01:25:52.947
<i>Should he see someone about multiple
concussions in a span of 24 hours?</i>

01:25:53.047 --> 01:25:56.326
<i>Definitely. Could he benefit from
maybe a therapist to help him...</i>

01:25:56.426 --> 01:25:59.759
<i>...sort out some of his many issues?
That's not for me to say.</i>

01:25:59.859 --> 01:26:01.634
<i>The main thing is...</i>

01:26:01.853 --> 01:26:04.129
<i>...Steve got his dog back.</i>

01:26:04.759 --> 01:26:06.952
<i>Lew the Jew made good on his deal...</i>

01:26:07.052 --> 01:26:09.999
<i>...and me, I got the girl.</i>

01:26:10.099 --> 01:26:12.326
<i>Never thought I'd get to say that.</i>

01:26:13.425 --> 01:26:15.160
She's all yours.

01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:18.012
You, uh, take good care of her, huh?

01:26:18.112 --> 01:26:20.526
- I will, Lew.
- Okay.

01:26:20.626 --> 01:26:23.227
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

01:26:24.925 --> 01:26:26.759
You did the right thing.

01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:29.301
Nah.

01:26:36.725 --> 01:26:38.460
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.430
Hi, baby.

01:26:41.931 --> 01:26:43.954
Do you like your new room?

01:26:44.054 --> 01:26:46.223
My new room is...

01:26:46.323 --> 01:26:49.337
...pretty amazing. Thanks, Uncle Steve.

01:26:49.859 --> 01:26:51.693
You're welcome.

01:26:51.793 --> 01:26:53.876
Have a good time today.

01:26:57.225 --> 01:26:59.275
Thought you might want that.

01:27:02.093 --> 01:27:03.941
Thank you.

01:27:10.126 --> 01:27:13.600
Hot moo! Moo!

01:27:14.926 --> 01:27:16.659
I'll take a steak.

01:27:16.759 --> 01:27:20.011
<i>Either way, everyone is happy.</i>

01:27:21.125 --> 01:27:23.370
<i>Case closed.</i>

01:27:26.258 --> 01:27:29.141
<i>- Hello.
- Steve, it's me, it's John.</i>

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:34.260
<i>- I can't hear you very well. Who is this?
- Here, I got you. It's John.</i>

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:37.159
Yeah, uh, look, I know everyone
is probably looking forward...

01:27:37.259 --> 01:27:39.735
...to my world-famous pasta salad...

01:27:39.835 --> 01:27:42.760
...but I won't be able to make it.

01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:46.026
<i>So I invite you to my party,
and you're not gonna bring anything?</i>

01:27:46.126 --> 01:27:49.126
I won't be able to attend the barbeque...
pasta salad's already made.

01:27:49.226 --> 01:27:51.326
<i>Okay, no worries, pal, I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

01:27:52.025 --> 01:27:53.826
Well, yeah...

01:27:53.926 --> 01:27:55.418
Hello?

01:27:57.887 --> 01:27:59.393
Steve?

01:28:01.886 --> 01:28:03.692
I believe he hung up.

01:28:04.292 --> 01:28:08.625
That's terrible, because if he's not gonna
come to us, now we gotta go to him...

01:28:08.725 --> 01:28:11.458
...which means you need
to tell us where he is.

01:28:12.959 --> 01:28:14.565
No.

01:28:14.664 --> 01:28:19.026
No, I won't. So, you're just
gonna have to find him...

01:28:19.126 --> 01:28:22.336
...and you won't be able to find Steve.
Not in Venice.

01:28:22.685 --> 01:28:25.553
He knows every nook and cranny
in this neighborhood. He'll disappear...

01:28:25.652 --> 01:28:30.293
...he's got friends in high places,
and got friends in low places.

01:28:30.393 --> 01:28:32.973
I didn't mean to quote
that country song right now but...

01:28:33.073 --> 01:28:38.026
...the point is, if he even gets a whiff
of trouble, he'll turn into a ghost.

01:28:38.126 --> 01:28:40.126
Not literally, obviously, but...

01:28:40.226 --> 01:28:42.541
Hold on. Clancy...

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:45.260
...rewind that shit back
like... like a minute.

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:49.559
What's the address of that house
we scored from Lew the Jew?

01:28:50.459 --> 01:28:54.859
<i>I'm standing in Steve's parents'
house at 845 Holland Canal...</i>

01:28:54.959 --> 01:28:59.026
<i>...the one with the white picket fence.
I think it's mid-century.</i>

01:28:59.126 --> 01:29:03.063
Really? And you know,
it's perfect timing because I'm starving...

01:29:03.163 --> 01:29:05.293
...and I really love pasta salad.

01:29:05.393 --> 01:29:07.992
I hear yours is world-renowned.

01:29:08.691 --> 01:29:12.080
You guys hungry?
Y'all ready to go eat? Yeah, okay?

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.792
We're going to a party, white boy.

01:29:14.892 --> 01:29:17.407
Oh, God. Please don't.

01:29:18.426 --> 01:29:20.330
Actually... let's go.

01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:24.241
Thank you... thank you
for not shooting my balls.

01:29:29.993 --> 01:29:32.060
Okay, well, I'll just be here.

01:30:35.026 --> 01:30:36.462
No.
