01:47.120 --> 01:52.831
My jewels! I've been robbed!
Someone stole my jewels!

01:53.040 --> 01:55.031
Help! Police!

02:13.400 --> 02:17.598
My diamonds! They've gone! Help!

05:10.440 --> 05:12.317
Monsieur Robie?

05:25.800 --> 05:31.033
Lepic, Mercier. Monsieur Robie,
we represent the <i>Sûreté</i>.

05:31.240 --> 05:35.028
We are making inquiries in reference
to some jewel robberies.

05:35.240 --> 05:40.473
We believe you could provide us
with information that would be helpful.

05:40.680 --> 05:45.390
Would you be good enough to
accompany us to our office in Nice?

05:53.440 --> 05:55.908
May I put on something more formal?

11:10.000 --> 11:13.231
- OK.
- You left in a hurry?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.476
- They came for me.
- The police?

11:15.680 --> 11:18.717
- Five of them.
- Naturally, you are innocent.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.992
I haven't stolen jewellery
in 15 years.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.555
- Honesty!
- It has a good feeling.

11:25.760 --> 11:29.799
What do you think of my kitchen?
Works like a machine.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.310
Like our little band
in the Underground during the War.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.910
Cutting, slicing, just like the old days.

11:37.120 --> 11:40.351
They think I'm responsible
for these robberies, don't they?

11:40.560 --> 11:45.873
- They were in prison with you.
- We're the first to be suspected.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.390
Since the War,
I have obliged them to be honest.

11:49.600 --> 11:54.674
I did not want them to break
their paroles and return to prison.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.872
If my parole is broken,
they'll throw away the key.

11:58.080 --> 12:02.517
I came to tell them and you that
I had nothing to do with the robberies.

12:02.720 --> 12:08.431
Perhaps I believe you, but your
comrades think you let them down.

12:08.640 --> 12:12.758
I wouldn't put it past them
to be doing the robberies themselves.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.871
Simple men without education?

12:15.080 --> 12:17.389
- No, Robie.
- Monsieur Bertani?

12:17.600 --> 12:21.718
Excuse me, business calls. Don't go.

12:37.320 --> 12:40.756
<i>Bonjour,</i> Foussard.

13:14.640 --> 13:17.393
Coincidence can be terrible.

13:17.600 --> 13:22.037
These robberies all bear your mark
but you claim to be innocent.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.356
I do more than claim. I insist!

13:27.480 --> 13:31.268
I can't understand how this thief
can imitate me so perfectly.

13:31.480 --> 13:36.110
It's someone who knew my technique,
maybe somebody in the police.

13:39.960 --> 13:43.157
He picks perfect victims
and the right stones.

13:43.360 --> 13:47.876
Goes up walls, over roofs, leaves
no clue and disappears in the night.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.798
Just like John Robie.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.754
- You don't believe me!
- You're as nervous as a cat.

13:53.960 --> 13:57.635
If somebody caught this imitator,
we'd all be off the hook.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.159
Surely.

13:59.360 --> 14:03.638
The police are chasing the wrong man.
Someone's got to chase the right one.

14:03.840 --> 14:07.628
- One day he'll make a mistake.
- There's only one answer.

14:07.840 --> 14:10.832
I've got to catch
this imitator myself.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.156
You couldn't do more than the police.

14:13.360 --> 14:18.115
But I could, and I'm the only one who
could, because I can anticipate him,

14:18.320 --> 14:23.030
figure out his next move and catch
him with his hand in the jewel case.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.879
Nobody will believe what you say.

14:26.080 --> 14:29.868
Who believes me now?
The biggest problem is time.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.231
I've got to hit him
before he hears I'm after him.

14:33.440 --> 14:37.228
I need better information, the kind
that takes months to dig out.

14:37.440 --> 14:40.477
Like who has jewels to be stolen?

14:40.680 --> 14:45.276
Yeah. Where they live, where they
keep the stones, how much they drink.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.711
Whether they have dogs,
guns, servants, insurance.

14:48.920 --> 14:52.196
For old times' sakes,
perhaps I can help you.

14:53.280 --> 14:56.590
- What have you got?
- You made me remember something.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.836
Two days ago, a man came here.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.917
- I did not like him.
- Why not?

15:01.120 --> 15:05.159
He called me to his table,
asked me about crime and criminals.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.432
Me, a respectable restaurateur!

15:08.640 --> 15:12.679
- Does he know about the robberies?
- He asks me questions.

15:12.880 --> 15:18.034
I refuse to answer. Then he asks me
about the jewels my clients wear.

15:18.240 --> 15:22.950
I say to myself, "You are something
to do with this new cat."

15:23.160 --> 15:25.037
"Maybe you are the new cat."

15:53.920 --> 15:57.708
Foussard's daughter will take you
by boat to the beach club in Cannes.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.115
Wait for a phone call there.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.792
- Mr Cat, let's go.
- Danielle, do me a favour.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.470
- Don't call me a cat.
- I only do one favour a day.

16:40.680 --> 16:45.913
- Will you do as your father asks?
- Did I brush your fur the wrong way?

17:21.079 --> 17:24.071
- You're getting us wet.
- It must be true.

17:24.280 --> 17:28.239
- Cats don't like water.
- Don't mention that word again.

17:28.440 --> 17:33.195
- A man should never regret his past.
- I only regret one thing.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.914
That you never asked me to
marry you?

17:36.120 --> 17:38.793
No, that I ever taught you English.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.788
You only taught me the nouns.
I learned the adjectives myself.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.037
- The word cat is a noun.
- Not the way you use it.

17:46.240 --> 17:50.358
For you it means excitement,
danger, affluence.

17:50.560 --> 17:54.997
What do you think of that word,
"affluence"? It means wealth.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.635
- What's on your mind?
- Nothing.

17:58.840 --> 18:03.118
I was thinking about you. Imagining
you in your expensive villa.

18:03.320 --> 18:07.598
Enjoying life, while we work
like idiots for a loaf of bread.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.314
I work too,
raising grapes and flowers.

18:10.520 --> 18:13.353
And rubies and diamonds and pearls.

18:15.080 --> 18:16.638
School's open again.

18:16.840 --> 18:21.118
Professor Robie will conduct a class
on how to get spanked in a hurry.

18:21.320 --> 18:26.075
You can't touch me. I've graduated.
Are you going to South America?

18:26.280 --> 18:28.794
No, just the beach club at Cannes.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.992
I've always dreamed
of going to South America.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.998
People say it's a virgin country.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.033
I can cook, sew,

18:38.240 --> 18:42.518
keep my mouth shut and peddle
stolen jewels on the black market.

18:44.680 --> 18:48.798
You don't think I'm responsible
for all those recent robberies?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.399
I think so.

18:50.600 --> 18:54.070
Yes, together with your father
and my Resistance pals.

18:54.280 --> 18:58.717
There's one great difference.
They are furious with you. I am not.

18:58.920 --> 19:03.357
Listen carefully. I stole once,
a long time ago. I went to jail.

19:03.560 --> 19:08.156
I know. You escaped, joined
the Underground and became heroes.

19:08.360 --> 19:12.592
I wanted to make up for the things
I'd done. I've never stolen since.

19:12.800 --> 19:17.396
I know what you've got.
Pardons that are not worth anything.

19:17.600 --> 19:22.037
They were paroles, and we fought
for six years to earn them,

19:22.240 --> 19:24.117
those of us who were still around.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.834
Those paroles don't have much value.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.032
They haven't been withdrawn
from circulation.

19:30.240 --> 19:35.268
- No South America?
- No, just the beach club at Cannes.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.040
Well, in that case we should hurry.

19:38.240 --> 19:41.710
That airplane probably
belongs to the police.

19:57.960 --> 20:02.078
- What's he doing now?
- He's coming back over us.

20:02.280 --> 20:06.478
- Good. Well, wave to him.
- Suppose he's not my type.

20:06.680 --> 20:10.229
Wave anyway, as if you're
a pretty girl out for a ride.

20:10.440 --> 20:11.953
Well...

20:17.520 --> 20:20.353
Not that pretty!
We want to get rid of him.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.870
- How much further to the club?
- About 15 minutes.

20:26.080 --> 20:30.039
When you get there, pull inshore
and mingle with the other boats.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.798
- And then?
- I'm getting out.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.596
- I'll leave my clothes with you.
- But you hoped to be inconspicuous!

20:36.800 --> 20:39.473
Nobody will recognise me in these.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.794
- Hello?
- The man I speak with you about.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.719
The man who ask about the jewels.

21:48.920 --> 21:51.798
He will wait for you
at the flower market in Nice.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.915
He will find you. I told him you
would be tossing a coin in the air.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.198
Tails?

22:51.840 --> 22:54.195
HH Hughson, Lloyd's of London.

22:54.400 --> 22:59.155
Are you the man who knows who owns
the best jewellery in this vicinity?

22:59.360 --> 23:04.354
- We insure the important pieces.
- Insurance? That's gambling.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.437
Shall we say betting?

23:06.640 --> 23:09.791
Yes, let's say betting.
I have a long shot for you.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.673
A little help in return
for some of your losses.

23:12.880 --> 23:16.509
- So Mr Bertani told me.
- Are you interested?

23:16.720 --> 23:20.998
The proposition sounds intriguing,
albeit a little unorthodox.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.077
Does that mean yes or no?

23:23.280 --> 23:25.157
- My dear Mr Robie...
- Smith.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.555
I beg your pardon. Ever been married?

23:27.760 --> 23:32.038
- No. What has that to do with it?
- It might help you to understand.

23:32.240 --> 23:35.869
I have two wives,
Felicity and the London office.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.957
I must return worthy of both.

23:38.160 --> 23:42.278
I see. They wouldn't approve
of your giving me a list of clients?

23:42.480 --> 23:46.632
Officially, you come under
the category of extremely bad risk.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.074
I'll see you later.

23:51.280 --> 23:56.513
It's a pleasure to meet an insurance
agent who enjoys paying off claims.

23:59.360 --> 24:03.148
- Unofficially, there's hope for you.
- I was sure there would be.

24:03.360 --> 24:08.115
- We're both taking a big chance.
- What happens to you if I'm caught?

24:08.320 --> 24:12.916
- I might be embarrassed or censured.
- They could put me away for good!

24:13.120 --> 24:14.997
You made a bad choice of profession.

24:15.200 --> 24:18.510
Let's come to an understanding.
I'm doing you a favour.

24:18.720 --> 24:21.553
I take the risks,
you get the jewellery back.

24:21.760 --> 24:26.276
Mr Smith, it strikes me that only
an honest man would be so foolish.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.155
- How much do you need?
- Half a dozen names.

24:32.360 --> 24:33.759
Anything else?

24:33.960 --> 24:37.839
Addresses, habits, descriptions
of the stones and settings.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.396
Suppose it gets into the wrong hands?

24:41.600 --> 24:45.559
It already has, unless you're
the thief. Where are you staying?

24:45.760 --> 24:47.159
Carlton, Cannes.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.872
No, my dear fellow,
not in the middle of the day.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.235
Bring it to the table with you.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.719
Come along.

26:23.360 --> 26:27.148
Under the circumstances,
do you think it pays to advertise?

26:27.360 --> 26:30.193
He hasn't left the villa in years.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.953
- How do you like the place?
- Immensely.

26:35.160 --> 26:40.393
It's a kind of heaven, where a man
dreams he'll go when he retires.

26:41.440 --> 26:45.399
About that list of clients
who have jewellery worth stealing.

26:45.600 --> 26:50.515
- Why don't we enjoy our lunch first?
- I don't want to seem impatient.

26:50.720 --> 26:55.430
But I have to come up with something
convincing for the magistrate.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.835
It's a nice custom they have here.

26:58.040 --> 27:01.271
Provisional liberty
based on insufficient evidence.

27:01.480 --> 27:03.357
That may not last long for me.

27:03.560 --> 27:08.634
- You were in the Underground Army.
- I was in the Resistance.

27:08.840 --> 27:11.308
- Did you kill many people?
- 72.

27:14.240 --> 27:18.711
I know what would have pleased you.
Not one of them was insured.

27:18.920 --> 27:22.390
You're a man of obvious good taste
in everything.

27:22.600 --> 27:26.388
- How did you... Why did you...?
- Why did I take up stealing?

27:26.600 --> 27:28.795
To live better, to own things,

27:29.000 --> 27:33.755
to acquire this good taste you enjoy
and which I'm reluctant to give up.

27:33.960 --> 27:37.430
- You were frankly dishonest?
- I tried to be.

27:37.640 --> 27:40.791
I thought you'd have
some tale of hardship,

27:41.000 --> 27:44.788
your mother ran off when
you were young, your father beat you.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.710
No. I was in an American trapeze act
in a circus that travelled in Europe.

27:49.920 --> 27:53.708
It folded, so I put my agility
to a more rewarding purpose.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.797
You have no other defence?

27:56.000 --> 28:00.118
I only stole from people
who wouldn't go hungry. Your plate.

28:01.400 --> 28:05.188
- Quiche Lorraine, you'll enjoy this.
- I've heard of it.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.233
- It looks delicious.
- Yes.

28:10.040 --> 28:13.396
It's wonderful.
The pastry is as light as air.

28:13.600 --> 28:17.229
Germaine has sensitive hands,
an exceedingly light touch.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.839
I can tell.

28:19.040 --> 28:23.670
She strangled a German general once,
without a sound.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.511
Extraordinary woman.

28:30.720 --> 28:34.508
I take it you were
a sort of modern Robin Hood.

28:34.720 --> 28:38.030
You gave away most of the proceeds
of your crime.

28:38.240 --> 28:44.031
Kept everything myself. Let's face it,
I was an out-and-out thief.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.754
- Like you.
- I say, steady on.

28:46.960 --> 28:50.748
Wait. Did you ever take an ashtray
from a hotel, or a towel?

28:50.960 --> 28:53.155
Souvenirs, they expect that.

28:53.360 --> 28:56.909
You're given an expense allowance
for your meals, right?

28:57.720 --> 29:03.431
This meal is free. Are you going to
deduct it from your expense account?

29:03.640 --> 29:06.916
- No, it would be stupid. You agree?
- Yes.

29:07.120 --> 29:10.112
You're a thief.
Only an amateur, of course.

29:10.320 --> 29:13.630
But it will help you sympathise
with us professionals.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.434
- I don't understand.
- Look at it this way.

29:16.640 --> 29:20.349
- You're sorry you took the ashtray?
- Right now, yes.

29:20.560 --> 29:23.836
You'll be sorry you didn't deduct
this lunch from your account.

29:24.040 --> 29:28.431
I can't deduct every little item.
I couldn't spare the time!

29:28.640 --> 29:30.676
Some day, you'll wish you had.

29:30.880 --> 29:33.952
If an ashtray is missing,
they don't come for you.

29:34.160 --> 29:38.358
Let a diamond bracelet disappear
and they shout, "Robie, The Cat!"

29:39.640 --> 29:43.474
You don't have to spend every day
proving your honesty. I do.

29:44.440 --> 29:47.159
Let's get down to business. The list.

29:51.560 --> 29:54.836
- Is something bothering you?
- I told the police.

29:57.800 --> 30:02.032
- I didn't expect them to like it.
- They thought it a splendid idea.

30:02.240 --> 30:05.391
They hope you'll provide
the evidence against you.

30:05.600 --> 30:08.512
Ah, yes.
It had to be something like that.

30:12.520 --> 30:16.479
- Suppose it all goes wrong?
- You're wasting time.

30:30.440 --> 30:33.910
Quite a thorough job.
Have some wine, Hughson.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.915
Yes, I think I will.

30:39.120 --> 30:43.989
I wish I'd known someone in insurance
when I started in the burglary business.

30:46.160 --> 30:50.039
Let me see, my first bait
will be this Mrs Stevens,

30:50.240 --> 30:53.391
the American with the diamonds
and the daughter.

30:53.600 --> 30:58.355
I'm having dinner with them tomorrow.
I could possibly arrange a meeting.

30:58.560 --> 31:03.793
In this business you can't do things
the honest way. Remember that.

31:12.640 --> 31:18.351
Wouldn't it be better if you left
that jewellery in the hotel safe?

31:18.560 --> 31:22.997
I didn't buy these things for
my old age. I bought them to wear.

31:24.800 --> 31:30.033
Put your money away. You can cheat
a little on your expense account.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.359
That's France.

31:38.560 --> 31:42.917
Everyone gets a tip, whether
he's earned it or not. It's the law.

31:43.120 --> 31:46.112
Everywhere you go,
you complain about tipping.

31:46.320 --> 31:49.869
And I shall continue to complain.
I've just paid for the privilege.

31:51.280 --> 31:54.590
Let's go to the casino.
I want to hit the tables.

31:54.800 --> 32:00.033
Perhaps I should just mail them the
money. No, Pierre, I can't afford it.

32:04.240 --> 32:07.391
Handsome! I wouldn't mind
buying that for you.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.477
- Mother!
- Come along.

32:09.680 --> 32:14.117
- Mr Hughson may not like gambling.
- Everyone likes to gamble, even you.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.356
I have an intense dislike for it.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.393
When the stakes are right,
you'll gamble.

32:20.240 --> 32:24.677
This is imitation? Really?
You mean, costume jewellery?

32:24.880 --> 32:30.113
The things they make! You can hardly
tell it from the real thing.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.675
Better than anything in Oregon.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.713
- Almost everything is!
- Thank you.

32:46.240 --> 32:51.633
Baccarat's my game. Why did you let
me close to this whirling pickpocket?

32:54.560 --> 32:56.118
Ah, wouldn't you know?

33:25.280 --> 33:26.998
I'm terribly sorry, madam.

33:34.560 --> 33:39.315
But, madam, that was
a 10,000 franc plaque.

33:50.520 --> 33:55.275
Maybe she... Madam, if you'd rather
not take my word, it's all right.

33:59.200 --> 34:02.670
Thank you. I'll trust you too.
I won't count it.

34:14.679 --> 34:17.034
If Jeremiah were only here!

34:17.239 --> 34:21.027
This flying around from Palm Springs
to St Moritz to the Riviera,

34:21.239 --> 34:23.117
he'd think it was foolishness.

34:23.320 --> 34:26.630
He used to say, "I wouldn't be
a society gadabout"

34:26.840 --> 34:29.991
"if they promised me
I could live forever."

34:30.199 --> 34:34.876
He got his wish! Mr Burns,
where did you say you were from?

34:35.080 --> 34:38.231
- Oregon.
- Jeremiah would have liked you.

34:38.440 --> 34:42.228
A man with both feet on the ground,
that's what he was.

34:42.440 --> 34:46.399
He never realised the value
of the ground he had his feet on.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.795
- We had a ranch...
- Mother, please.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.072
Mr Burns would be interested.
We had a ranch, not a very big one.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.953
No plumbing. A little thing out back.

34:57.160 --> 35:01.438
Jeremiah will never know how close
he came to 20 million barrels of oil.

35:06.280 --> 35:11.035
Bourbon's the only drink. You can
pour that champagne down the Channel.

35:11.240 --> 35:14.073
Why wait 80 years to drink the stuff?

35:14.280 --> 35:17.909
Great vineyards,
huge barrels ageing forever,

35:18.120 --> 35:20.270
poor monks running around testing it,

35:20.480 --> 35:23.790
so some woman in Oklahoma
can say it tickles her nose!

35:24.000 --> 35:26.673
Mother, we ought to go to bed.

35:28.800 --> 35:31.712
Nobody ever calls me Jessie any more.

35:34.240 --> 35:36.435
Mr Burns, would you call me Jessie?

35:36.640 --> 35:39.313
- I'd be happy to.
- Good.

35:41.160 --> 35:43.196
Mr Hughson, would you call me Jessie?

35:43.400 --> 35:45.277
- If you like.
- I like.

35:45.480 --> 35:48.631
- Mr Burns, you said lumber?
- That's right.

35:49.680 --> 35:55.152
How come you haven't made a pass at
my daughter? Don't say, "Oh, Mother!"

35:55.360 --> 35:59.148
- Mr Burns, I asked you a question.
- Very pretty.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.874
Quietly attractive.

36:02.080 --> 36:05.868
But too nice. Sorry I ever sent her
to that finishing school.

36:06.080 --> 36:09.390
- They finished her there!
- Come on, Mother.

36:09.600 --> 36:13.388
And so to bed, where I can cuddle up
to my jewellery.

36:13.600 --> 36:17.388
You know, Mr Hughson,
as rare and wonderful as they are,

36:17.600 --> 36:19.955
I'd rather have 100,000 Jeremiahs.

36:20.160 --> 36:23.948
- I'll toddle along to my cot.
- I'll escort you to your suite.

36:24.160 --> 36:29.837
- Very thoughtful. Come on, Jessie.
- Do you make much money at lumber?

36:30.040 --> 36:32.713
Right now, building is booming.

36:32.920 --> 36:35.912
Would you mind
if I had you investigated?

36:36.120 --> 36:38.475
Not at all. With what object?

36:38.680 --> 36:42.468
If I were Francie's age,
you'd sound too good to be true.

36:55.920 --> 37:01.153
Thank you. You know, there's
very little lumber around here.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.715
Why did you come to the Riviera?

37:03.920 --> 37:06.434
To meet someone as charming as you.

37:06.640 --> 37:10.428
Boy, now I am going to have you
investigated!

37:10.640 --> 37:14.110
- Aren't you going in?
- I'm down the other end.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.030
How much did he get away with?

38:32.240 --> 38:35.630
The gems were insured
for 35,000 in dollars.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.717
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

38:37.920 --> 38:42.357
I sympathise. Pretty rough having to
send bad news back to your office.

38:42.560 --> 38:45.393
I insured Madame Leroux personally.

38:45.600 --> 38:49.878
At least you know that the burglar...
What do they call him?

38:50.080 --> 38:51.718
- The Cat.
- Yes.

38:53.120 --> 38:57.875
He's still around and getting closer
all the time. That's something.

38:58.080 --> 39:02.358
Mrs Stevens, would you keep
your jewellery in the hotel safe?

39:02.560 --> 39:06.519
- Do I wear the safe round my neck?
- Not literally.

39:06.720 --> 39:10.190
Your insurance company goes into
shock every time something's stolen.

39:10.400 --> 39:14.188
If you haven't any guts,
you shouldn't have taken my bet.

39:14.400 --> 39:18.188
- Do you wanna welch?
- If they're stolen, you'll be paid.

39:18.400 --> 39:22.473
But we couldn't replace the affection
you have for those pieces.

39:22.680 --> 39:25.672
I have no more affection
for that jewellery

39:25.880 --> 39:28.599
than I have for a train ticket.

39:28.800 --> 39:33.828
They're pretty and make it possible
for my daughter to go to places

39:34.040 --> 39:37.157
and not be ashamed of me,
that is, too ashamed of me.

39:37.880 --> 39:41.509
- Good morning, Mr Hughson.
- Good morning.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.597
- Mr Burns.
- You sent for me.

39:43.800 --> 39:47.873
I thought we might go for a swim or,
if you're not athletic, sunbathing.

39:48.080 --> 39:51.117
I think I can manage to stay afloat.

39:51.320 --> 39:54.437
Mr Hughson's been telling us
about a robbery.

39:54.640 --> 39:55.914
Who?

39:56.120 --> 40:00.238
Madame Leroux, wife of
a high government official. $35,000.

40:00.440 --> 40:03.910
Too bad. You should find
a more happy business.

40:04.120 --> 40:07.317
The famous jewel thief, The Cat,
is loose again.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.476
Mother, you're next.

40:09.680 --> 40:11.557
I'm insured.

40:11.760 --> 40:16.197
- I'll get my bathing trunks.
- I'll be down in a few minutes.

40:16.400 --> 40:19.472
- Good hunting, Hughson.
- Just a minute.

40:19.680 --> 40:23.468
- Weren't we going to...?
- Weren't we going to what?

40:23.680 --> 40:26.831
- Last night we discussed going up.
- Up?

40:27.040 --> 40:31.716
- Up the funicular railway.
- I can't even spell funicular!

40:34.120 --> 40:36.315
What are you doing this afternoon?

40:36.520 --> 40:39.671
A real estate agent
gave me a list of villas for rent.

40:39.880 --> 40:42.110
Do you plan that long a vacation?

40:42.320 --> 40:44.834
I might even retire here.

40:45.040 --> 40:50.433
Some of the villas aren't in good
repair. The roofs need examination.

40:51.600 --> 40:56.833
Don't let the robbery spoil your day.
It's only money, and not even yours!

41:15.200 --> 41:18.351
Shall I ask the social director
to introduce us?

41:18.560 --> 41:21.711
No, I was wondering
which was the best way out.

41:21.920 --> 41:26.357
- The Mediterranean's this way.
- I'm a gambler. Let's try that.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.517
There's a message for you.

41:47.520 --> 41:48.919
Thank you.

43:05.840 --> 43:09.150
You performed a beautiful robbery
last night.

43:09.360 --> 43:10.839
Strictly routine.

43:11.040 --> 43:16.751
You steal a small fortune and then lie
on the beach with an American beauty.

43:16.960 --> 43:19.474
That's why one needs a small fortune.

43:19.680 --> 43:23.878
- Is this your next victim?
- She's a useful friend.

43:25.120 --> 43:29.875
Your old friends of the Resistance
who work at the restaurant,

43:30.080 --> 43:34.676
they called the police terrible names
when they let you go yesterday.

43:34.880 --> 43:38.668
Would it be bad manners to ask
who tipped off the police?

43:38.880 --> 43:41.599
They never say anything to the <i>flics.</i>

43:41.800 --> 43:43.199
Somebody did.

43:43.400 --> 43:47.188
But they would be happy if you were
caught during your next job.

43:47.400 --> 43:49.755
It's nice to know I have friends.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.509
- Perhaps it would be better.
- Any particular reason?

43:53.720 --> 43:59.317
I heard talk in the kitchen: What
a pity if they must kill The Cat.

43:59.520 --> 44:01.750
They will do all they can to avoid prison.

44:01.960 --> 44:06.033
The police want me in jail.
My old friends want me dead.

44:06.240 --> 44:09.596
- The Cat wants me out of town.
- What do you mean?

44:09.800 --> 44:13.236
He sent me a message.
The sky is about to fall in on me.

44:13.440 --> 44:18.878
It's foolish to remain here without
knowing what may happen to you.

44:19.120 --> 44:23.557
If you were in South America with me,
you would know what will happen.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.876
You make it sound dangerous.

44:26.080 --> 44:29.755
It would be so much nicer
to be killed by love, no?

44:29.960 --> 44:31.951
I'll get the water out of my ear.

44:32.160 --> 44:36.312
John, you know what sort of men
they are at Bertani's.

44:36.520 --> 44:39.034
They will do something to you.

44:39.240 --> 44:42.038
Yes. I better get back.

44:43.360 --> 44:46.670
What has she got more than me,
except money?

44:46.880 --> 44:49.713
And you are getting plenty of that.

44:49.920 --> 44:53.549
Danielle, you are just a girl.
She is a woman.

44:54.440 --> 44:59.275
Why do you want to buy an old car
if you can get a new one cheaper?

44:59.480 --> 45:01.948
It will run better and last longer.

45:04.400 --> 45:06.356
My old car just drove off.

45:06.560 --> 45:12.556
No, it's turned amphibious. I thought
I'd see what the big attraction was.

45:12.760 --> 45:16.833
- And rate an introduction.
- You didn't tell me your name.

45:17.040 --> 45:20.350
- Danielle Foussard.
- Miss Stevens.

45:20.560 --> 45:24.917
How do you do? Mr Burns has told me
so little about you.

45:25.120 --> 45:29.238
- We met a couple of minutes ago.
- That's right, a few minutes.

45:29.440 --> 45:33.228
Only a few minutes ago?
And you talk like old friends!

45:33.440 --> 45:36.159
That's warm, friendly France for you!

45:36.360 --> 45:41.229
I was asking about renting some water
skis. Would you like me to teach you?

45:41.440 --> 45:44.910
Thank you, but I was
women's champion last season.

45:45.120 --> 45:50.035
- It was just an idea.
- Were you talking about water skis?

45:50.240 --> 45:54.392
It looked as though you were
conjugating irregular verbs.

45:55.880 --> 46:01.238
- Say something nice, Danielle.
- She looks a lot older up close.

46:04.160 --> 46:07.789
To a mere child,
anything over 20 might seem old.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.994
A child? Shall we stand
in shallower water and discuss that?

46:16.480 --> 46:20.598
- Enjoying yourself?
- It's very nice, the sun and all.

46:20.800 --> 46:24.110
It's too much for me.
I'll see you at the hotel.

46:24.320 --> 46:29.235
Finish telling me why French women
are more seductive than Americans.

46:29.440 --> 46:31.954
You know what I'd like to tell you!

47:17.360 --> 47:18.713
Here.

47:54.800 --> 47:56.677
Do you have time for me now?

47:56.880 --> 48:00.998
- I'm sorry I was so long out there.
- I thought you'd be a lot longer.

48:01.200 --> 48:04.909
Well, what about cocktails?
Six o'clock suit you?

48:05.120 --> 48:07.315
We can talk about that on the way.

48:07.520 --> 48:09.715
- To where?
- To rent you a villa.

48:11.120 --> 48:14.874
- Picking a villa is personal.
- I have my car.

48:15.080 --> 48:17.719
And lunch with chicken and beer.

48:17.920 --> 48:21.230
It's too much to expect.
A tiring, dusty trip...

48:21.440 --> 48:25.399
You're bound to get lost. A stranger
who doesn't know the language.

48:25.600 --> 48:28.751
I was going to hire
an English-speaking chauffeur.

48:28.960 --> 48:30.837
I'll give you a wholesale rate.

48:31.040 --> 48:34.919
- And no tipping.
- Your terms are generous.

48:38.480 --> 48:41.392
- Too generous to refuse.
- My terms usually are.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.955
- Where's your car?
- Right there.

48:44.160 --> 48:47.948
I can't seem to get out of this
gracefully, so let's go.

49:37.480 --> 49:42.031
I've been waiting for you to mention
that kiss I gave you last night.

49:42.240 --> 49:45.710
Back home in Oregon,
we'd call you a headstrong girl.

49:45.920 --> 49:50.198
- Where in Oregon? The Rogue River?
- Where were you born?

49:50.400 --> 49:53.517
In a taxi, halfway between home
and the hospital.

49:53.720 --> 49:55.597
I've lived in 27 different towns.

49:55.800 --> 49:58.314
- Is somebody chasing you?
- Boys.

49:58.520 --> 50:00.590
You can stop running now.

50:00.800 --> 50:05.351
When my father died, they discovered
oil on our land. I started to travel.

50:05.560 --> 50:08.711
- The boys' fathers were chasing you?
- Yes.

50:08.920 --> 50:12.230
I had a funny feeling
they wanted my money.

50:12.440 --> 50:14.317
I'm impressed.

50:14.520 --> 50:18.798
Back in Oregon, we'd have called you
a rich, headstrong girl.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.037
- Money handles most people.
- You believe that?

50:22.240 --> 50:25.312
- I've proved it.
- You're a singular girl.

50:25.520 --> 50:27.909
- Is that good or bad?
- Good.

50:28.120 --> 50:31.908
You know what you want,
you go after it. Nothing stops you.

50:32.120 --> 50:33.997
You make it sound corny.

50:34.200 --> 50:37.078
You're a jackpot
of admirable character traits.

50:37.280 --> 50:38.952
I knew that.

50:39.160 --> 50:42.470
You do things with dispatch.
No wasted preliminaries.

50:42.680 --> 50:46.798
Not only did I enjoy that kiss,
I was awed by the efficiency behind it.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.355
I believe in getting down to essentials.

50:49.560 --> 50:53.269
Inviting me for breakfast,
planning a swim and now this drive.

50:53.480 --> 50:56.552
Miss Stevens,
you are a girl in a million.

50:56.760 --> 51:00.150
That's a routine compliment,
but I'll accept it.

51:00.360 --> 51:04.148
- May I ask a personal question?
- I've been hoping you would.

51:04.360 --> 51:07.670
What do you expect to get
out of being nice to me?

51:07.880 --> 51:11.350
- More than you're willing to offer.
- I know.

51:12.120 --> 51:14.395
You're in Europe to buy a husband.

51:14.600 --> 51:18.229
- The man I want doesn't have a price.
- That eliminates me.

51:40.360 --> 51:43.670
You're right. Give me a woman
who knows her own mind.

51:43.880 --> 51:47.077
No one gives you a woman like that.
You have to capture her.

51:47.280 --> 51:49.396
- Any particular method?
- Yes.

51:49.600 --> 51:52.910
But it's no good unless
you discover it yourself.

51:54.000 --> 51:58.790
- Are you sure this is the address?
- It's on the estate agent's list.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.353
Let me see.

52:00.560 --> 52:04.235
Let's look at the gardens.
No need to bother the people.

52:05.120 --> 52:06.838
Why don't you own a place like this?

52:07.040 --> 52:11.238
Palaces are for royalty. We're just
common people with a bank account.

52:11.440 --> 52:13.556
That sounds like your mother, not you.

52:13.760 --> 52:17.070
We're not that different.
A few years and some grammar.

52:17.280 --> 52:19.635
And jewellery. You never wear any.

52:19.840 --> 52:22.115
I don't like cold things on my skin.

52:22.320 --> 52:26.836
- Why not invent some hot diamonds?
- I prefer more tangible excitement.

52:27.040 --> 52:32.034
- What do you get a thrill out of most?
- I'm still looking for that one.

52:37.280 --> 52:39.191
We were going to look at the gardens.

52:44.800 --> 52:48.793
I was interested in the architecture.
Turn of the century, isn't it?

52:54.960 --> 52:56.837
You never mention your wife.

52:57.040 --> 53:00.828
- I never found time to get married.
- You don't seem pushed for time.

53:01.040 --> 53:04.032
Did you come over to add items
to your diary,

53:04.240 --> 53:07.550
like the name of that French girl
you swam out to meet?

53:07.760 --> 53:11.878
- You are husband-hunting after all.
- That wasn't jealousy you heard.

53:12.080 --> 53:16.835
Merely disappointment in your limited
imagination. Teenage French girls!

53:17.040 --> 53:21.795
I bet you snowed her under, the
handsome lumber man from America.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.992
I'll bet you told her
all your trees were sequoias.

53:25.200 --> 53:29.478
That sounds like jealousy to me.
Don't be ashamed of it. Let it out.

53:29.680 --> 53:33.389
- You're somewhat egotistical.
- Fighting fire with fire.

53:33.600 --> 53:36.751
- Miss Stevens?
- Yes, Mr Burns?

53:36.960 --> 53:38.871
- You know what I think?
- About what?

53:39.080 --> 53:41.958
- You.
- I don't really care.

53:44.160 --> 53:46.037
Tell me.

53:46.240 --> 53:50.358
You're an insecure, pampered woman,
accustomed to attracting men.

53:50.560 --> 53:54.348
You're not sure whether they're
attracted to you or your money.

53:55.360 --> 53:57.874
- You may never know.
- Anything else?

53:58.080 --> 54:01.868
You need something I haven't the time
or inclination to give you.

54:02.080 --> 54:03.911
And what is that?

54:04.120 --> 54:07.476
Two weeks with a good man
at Niagara Falls.

54:44.280 --> 54:46.794
I'm hungry. What about that picnic?

54:47.000 --> 54:49.833
Not till we get to
the picnic grounds.

54:50.040 --> 54:53.510
- Which you've picked out.
- Which I've picked out.

54:53.720 --> 54:56.234
- Is it far?
- A few miles.

54:56.440 --> 54:59.079
- Lonely and secluded?
- Naturally.

55:07.360 --> 55:10.193
Then why are we dawdling like this?

55:10.400 --> 55:13.870
That's exactly what
was running through my mind.

57:40.960 --> 57:43.952
- Slow down.
- And let them catch us?

57:44.160 --> 57:47.789
- Let who catch us?
- The police who were following you.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.355
Police following me?

57:50.560 --> 57:54.997
Yes, police following you,
John Robie, The Cat.

58:17.640 --> 58:21.633
Lovely day! Have you ever seen
any place more beautiful?

58:21.840 --> 58:24.991
Just look at the colours
of the sea and the sky,

58:25.200 --> 58:27.236
and the pink and green buildings.

58:27.440 --> 58:31.149
Think of all those roofs
you could climb over.

58:31.360 --> 58:33.874
- Who did you call me?
- John Robie.

58:34.080 --> 58:38.835
The jewel thief known as The Cat.
I read about you in the Paris paper.

58:39.040 --> 58:41.076
You may have read about The Cat...

58:41.280 --> 58:45.876
I thought you said you were hungry.
The picnic basket's in the trunk.

58:54.640 --> 58:58.918
Try to bluff me, and I can have the
fun of telling you how clever I was.

58:59.120 --> 59:01.554
Since I'm not Mr Robie but Mr Burns,

59:01.760 --> 59:06.276
there would be hardly any point,
but tell me how clever you were.

59:06.480 --> 59:10.917
- The first thing I noticed...
- Don't sound so pleased!

59:11.120 --> 59:15.238
I never caught a jewel thief before.
It's stimulating. It's like...

59:15.440 --> 59:17.476
Like sitting in a hot tub?

59:18.960 --> 59:23.238
Let me serve. First time I saw you
was on the beach at Cannes.

59:23.440 --> 59:27.228
You swam ashore from a motor boat
driven by that French girl.

59:27.440 --> 59:31.149
- You got an opener? Thank you.
- Do you want a leg or a breast?

59:31.360 --> 59:33.237
You make the choice.

59:33.440 --> 59:37.228
That was two days before
you showed up as Mr Conrad Burns,

59:37.440 --> 59:39.237
just over from America.

59:39.440 --> 59:41.715
- Did you swim?
- Naturally.

59:41.920 --> 59:45.071
Don't be disappointing
and sound like Mr Burns.

59:45.280 --> 59:49.558
- I can only be myself, Miss Stevens.
- Then be yourself, John.

59:49.760 --> 59:52.911
- I prefer Conrad.
- You can't be serious.

59:53.120 --> 59:56.669
It's time you called me Francie.

59:56.880 --> 59:59.519
They've tried to steal Mother's
jewellery before.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:04.714
When I read about the... you in the
paper, a small item, but I picked it up,

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.070
I was sure Mother would catch your eye.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.191
She did, because I liked her.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.073
- So far, Miss Stevens...
- Francie.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.750
- You haven't said anything clever.
- Stick around.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:19.111
The next thing I noticed
was something remarkable.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:22.995
All evening, you looked at my mother,
not at me.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.431
- I kissed you, didn't I?
- I kissed you.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.279
- I wasn't looking at her then.
- You were thinking about her.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.359
- You let me say goodnight so easily.
- I'm a gentleman.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.950
A rough lumber man
from the Northwest?

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.232
I must remember to yell
"Timber!" occasionally.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:46.793
Here comes the clever part.
You're just not convincing, John.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.151
You're like an American
in an English movie.

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.352
You don't talk like
an American tourist.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.711
The guidebooks say,
"Don't behave like a tourist."

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.230
You never mention business
or baseball or television

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.954
or wage freezes or Senate probes.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.674
The things I left America to forget.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.350
You're not American enough
to carry it off.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.348
- Tell me, how long has it been?
- How long has what been?

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.870
- Since you were in America.
- Four or five days.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.594
- And Oregon?
- Two days before that.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.509
Name three deciduous trees
indigenous to the Northwest.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.190
You're a very nice girl
with too much imagination.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.188
Talk like that and I'll go to jail
for something I didn't do.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.436
Will you rob Mother or somebody else?

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:37.758
- Somebody else!
- That's nice. Mother likes you.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.919
Lady Kenton should be our next job.
Isn't she on your list?

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.238
She ought to be. The Kenton jewels
are famous. I know her villa.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.716
- I can hear your next line.
- The Cat has a new kitten.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.753
- When do we start?
- Don't talk like that.

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.953
- You're leaving fingerprints on me.
- I am not The Cat.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.630
Why are the police following you?
Show me that list.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:05.675
That villa isn't for rent. The Sanfords
own it. I'm going to a party there.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.388
You've a very strong grip.
The kind a burglar needs.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.594
That's why you came up here.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:29.868
We'll have cocktails at 8.00
and dinner at 8.30 in my suite.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.752
We'll talk about it there.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.714
I can't come. I'm going to the casino
and a firework display.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.673
There's a better view from my place.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.916
Already got another date.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:45.079
Everywhere you go, I'll have
you paged as John Robie, The Cat.

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.754
8.00 and be on time.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.748
- I haven't got a decent watch.
- Steal one.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:00.114
I could not speak with you today, Mr
Robie. I did not know your new name.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.835
What were you doing
at the Sanford villa?

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:07.874
I supply food for the grand gala.
I was inspecting the kitchen.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.313
<i>I do not ask you what you were</i>
<i>doing there. You prepare also, no?</i>

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.910
<i>There will be many women,</i>
<i>rich jewels.</i>

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.669
- Just the bait I need.
- Something The Cat can't resist?

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.190
- I suppose your boys will be there.
- <i>Naturally.</i>

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.834
They threatened to put me away.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.828
They'd be much too busy
to do anything like that.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.032
- You keep them busy.
- <i>Goodbye, Robie.</i>

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.754
Who was the pretty American girl?

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.793
<i>You bring her to my restaurant</i>
<i>for dinner?</i>

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.470
- Not tonight. She made plans for us.
- Soon.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:59.555
If you want to see the fireworks,
it's better with the lights out.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:04.038
You're going to see one of the
Riviera's most fascinating sights.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.028
- I was talking about the fireworks.
- I never doubted it.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.710
The way you looked at my necklace,
I didn't know.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.230
You've been dying
to say something about it.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.479
- Have I been staring at it?
- You've been trying to avoid it.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.875
May I have a brandy? Care for one?

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:28.679
No, thank you. Some nights
a person doesn't need to drink.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:37.558
Aren't you nervous to be in a room
with diamonds, unable to touch them?

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.637
No.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.230
Like an alcoholic outside a bar
on election day.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.153
- Wouldn't know the feeling.
- All right.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.319
You've studied the layout,
worked out your timetable,

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:56.913
put on dark clothes with crêpe-soled
shoes and a rope, face blackened.

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:03.311
Over the roofs, down to the right
apartment... and the window's locked.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.832
All that elation turned into frustration.
What would you do?

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.031
I'd go home, get some sleep.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:15.431
What would you do? The thrill is
in front of you, but you can't get it.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:19.110
The gems glistening
on the other side of the window.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:23.950
- Someone asleep, breathing heavily.
- I'd go home, get some sleep.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:28.878
Wouldn't you use a glass cutter,
your fist, to get what you wanted,

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.753
knowing it was there waiting for you?

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.430
- Forget it.
- Drinking dulls your senses.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.473
And if I'm lucky, some of my hearing.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:42.798
Blue-white with hairlike touches
of platinum.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.039
I have the same interest in jewellery
as in politics, modern poetry,

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:50.073
or women who need
weird excitement: None.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:55.308
Hold this necklace in your hand
and tell me you're not Robie The Cat.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:01.033
John, you're going to rob that villa
we cased this afternoon, aren't you?

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:05.677
I suppose "rob" is archaic.
You'd say "knock over"?

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.757
Don't worry. I'm good at secrets.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.669
- Have you been to a psychiatrist?
- Don't change the subject.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:16.078
I know the perfect time. Next week
is the Sanfords' annual gala.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:20.068
Everyone who counts will be there.
I'll get you an invitation.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.157
It's an 18th-century costume affair.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.955
There'll be thousands of dollars'
worth of jewellery.

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:30.711
Some guests stay for the weekend.
We'll do it together. What do you say?

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:34.199
My comment would be censorable.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.235
Give up, John. Admit who you are.

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.714
I can tell where you're looking.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:01.677
Look, John. Hold them.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:07.714
Diamonds, the only thing in the world
you can't resist.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:12.152
Then tell me you don't know
what I'm talking about.

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:28.913
Ever had a better offer in
your whole life? One with everything?

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:36.629
- I've never had a crazier one.
- Just as long as you're satisfied.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:44.797
You know as well as I do
this necklace is imitation.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.877
Well, I'm not.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:26.037
- Give them back to me.
- What did you have in mind?

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.515
Give them back. Mother's jewels.

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:32.197
I don't have them.

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:38.430
Wait a minute.

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:44.834
- When did it happen?
- When I was asleep.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.997
- Let's look.
- The place to look is here!

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.156
Help yourself.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.518
Did Francie tell you what happened?

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.154
Yes, she's searching my room.

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:03.319
- She knew where my jewellery was.
- May I look in your room?

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:08.036
If it'll do any good. We ought to
call the police and the manager.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.117
Would you let me look first?

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:13.312
I'd be happy
if you didn't find anything.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.397
Why do you say that?

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:20.354
I'm tired of draping them over me.
It's exciting to have them stolen.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.551
You can't lose, as long as
Hughson makes out the cheque.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:27.548
I'd be crazy to take this attitude
if I did.

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:32.675
Why did Francie suspect you, Mr Burns?
A woodcutter from Oregon!

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.158
I'm anything but that, Mrs Stevens.
My real name is John Robie.

01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:40.193
I used to be a jewel thief years ago.

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:45.952
- What a wonderful surprise!
- I can't get worked up over it.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.755
- Where did you keep the stuff?
- In the case.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:54.668
- Watch out for fingerprints.
- There won't be any.

01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.515
- Did they get everything?
- Everything.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:02.035
Francie must have known about you.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.437
She guessed today.
You must sleep soundly.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.517
I do.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.430
He came down through the air shaft.

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:17.235
If you're not Mr Burns, why do you
call yourself that and not...

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:21.638
- What was the other name?
- John Robie. Mrs Stevens...

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.628
- The gang won't let you go straight?
- The gang is the law.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.752
Mother, don't talk to him.

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.155
Don't touch anything to cover any clues.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:35.433
There aren't any clues. He came down
the air shaft and went the same way.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:38.996
- You know how he got in.
- Did you find anything in my room?

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:42.351
- I certainly did.
- Nothing of your mother's.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.755
You gave those to your accomplice.

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.556
But the clothes of Mr Burns,
the American, all had French labels.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:54.038
I found this: Everyone on the Riviera
with jewellery worth stealing.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.435
Listen to what it says about us.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.757
What good is that?
You're already caught.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:04.397
I called the police and told them
who you are and what you did tonight.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:09.355
Everything? The boys must have
enjoyed that down at headquarters.

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:12.757
He isn't Burns.
He's a jewel thief called The Cat.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.478
What's he doing here now
if he's already got the junk?

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:23.754
- Returning to the scene of crime.
- Since when is love a crime?

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:28.397
Robie is a real man, not one of
those milksops you take up with.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.433
- Mother, after all.
- After all, my foot.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.077
Why do you think we moved so many
times? Your father was a swindler.

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.558
But a lovable one. This one's
a bigger operator on every level.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.159
Thank you.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.434
I've had to travel round after you
to keep men like this away from you.

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:52.030
It looks like the blockers
are having all the fun.

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.799
She doesn't have common sense, I do.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.710
They're my baubles. If I don't care,
why should you? They're insured.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.871
Now, where do we go from here?

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:08.637
To jail.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.235
- Where is he?
- Who?

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:29.113
- John Robie.
- Never heard of him.

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.791
<i>Mother, the book you're reading</i>
<i>is upside down.</i>

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:51.519
We may be in France, but a man
is innocent till proved guilty.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.597
- Proved!
- That won't be hard.

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.554
John Robie's the first man
who wouldn't roll over for you.

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:00.433
He played us both for fools.

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:03.950
You ought to be sent back
to public school.

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.948
- They could pound sense into you.
- He's a worthless thief.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.789
- Just what did he steal from you?
- Mother!

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.788
Sit down while I tell you something
about life and John Robie.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.195
Sit down before I knock you down.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.710
For three days, you've been fishing?

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:45.959
Keep it down. Do you still believe
I did the Stevens job?

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:51.350
Yes, until you sent for me. You'd
hardly risk my bringing the police.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.993
Thank you.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.351
You've been in hiding.
Why did you come out?

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.552
- I need your help.
- I need yours more.

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.637
My superiors at the London office...

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:05.310
I might solve some of your problems,
possibly all.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.308
- That's too much to hope for.
- I've been watching a villa.

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.034
- Which one?
- The South American couple.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.473
Somebody else is watching it too, but
I haven't managed to find out who.

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.557
- Has he seen you?
- Probably.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:24.197
I want to set a foolproof trap.
I need the assistance of the police.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.277
I can't approach them.

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:31.554
- How do you know he'll be there?
- Somebody gave this to Germaine.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.396
It's in French. What does it say?

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:40.355
"Stay away from the Silvas' villa.
It's my night to yell, not yours."

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.348
- Who gave it to Germaine?
- It was in her shopping basket.

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:49.714
Look, convince Lepic to have police
at the villa soon after midnight.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.597
- You're going there?
- Of course.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.237
That note is bait for a trap. Someone
wants you to go to the Silvas'.

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.273
- I know it.
- Possibly to kill you.

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:03.313
- Will you talk to Lepic?
- All right.

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.034
But if this Cat doesn't show up,

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:10.358
the police might get you and
the thing will turn out rather badly.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.074
I'd better go along as your alibi.

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:17.239
I know you get insurance
at a discount but why be foolhardy?

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.830
Everyone in Philadelphia
reads "The Bulletin".

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.598
Just a minute.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:31.359
- What's all the excitement?
- The cat burglar's dead.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.118
John Robie?

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.438
No, a man named Foussard.
A wine steward in a restaurant.

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:41.428
You better start practising
your apologies in two languages.

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:47.194
You're positive Foussard was The Cat?

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.233
We have no reason
to change the story.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:55.514
- That's hardly a direct answer.
- I cannot give another. Excuse me.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:59.838
One more point, Lepic.
This is a cheque for $280,000.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:04.477
That's nearly 92 million francs.
Since you've killed The Cat...

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.831
He killed himself
attempting to escape justice.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.510
I've been instructed
to pay off the Stevens claim.

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:16.748
I'm disinclined to do so if recovery
of the jewellery is imminent. Is it?

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.032
- It will take time.
- Several centuries!

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:26.032
I just came in to congratulate you
on your capture.

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:33.870
All's well that ends well. The papers
have headlines, tourists can relax.

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:37.629
You, Lepic, got your publicity
and a commendation from Paris.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:42.197
Everyone got some good out of it,
except Hughson's company.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:45.710
- But they can afford it.
- It has cut their assets.

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:51.159
Poor Foussard. Never guessed
it was him, a wine waiter.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.316
Family man, wooden leg.

01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:02.798
Didn't you know? Certainly. He lost it
during the War. That's remarkable.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.552
A man with a wooden leg climbs up
walls with the agility of a cat.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.911
- Is that true?
- I believe he had a bad leg.

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:15.510
You showed good taste
keeping it out of the newspapers.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.790
I'll drop into Foussard's funeral,
pay my last respects.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.630
Oh, and get a look at the real Cat,
who'll be there purring.

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.791
- You know who the real Cat is?
- I do.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.310
- Tell the Commissioner.
- He wouldn't believe me.

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.671
- Try me.
- You'd find it hard to believe.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:40.078
When I catch The Cat with
a handful of stolen diamonds...

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:43.670
It's because I gave this story
you're at liberty.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.555
If I catch you on a roof,
I'll call the reporters again.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:51.514
Lepic, that's all I wanted to know.
Good day.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:45.073
- A most unhappy affair, Robie.
- Because it isn't me down there?

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:51.833
Poor Danielle.
I have a great compassion for her.

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:55.197
I'll look out for her.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.153
What happened to the stuff he stole?

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:03.319
That's a mystery. The police
have looked in every place.

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:08.916
- Some day, it'll turn up.
- The boys owe you many thanks.

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.678
- For what?
- You know.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:14.350
For risking prison to capture The Cat.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.437
Oh, that.

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:20.918
But you have no reason to complain.

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.634
Could you be a little more specific?

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.673
The American girl, what's her name?

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.354
Francie Stevens, that the one?

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.391
What luck.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:38.948
A beautiful woman with love for you,
rich beyond your dreams.

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:43.278
- I dream pretty rich.
- When are you going to America?

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.357
I didn't know I was.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:50.148
You will make a great mistake
if you don't marry her

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:53.352
and return to your native country.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:59.908
Let's talk about it at the Sanford gala,
between your catering duties.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:02.793
- You are not invited.
- I will be.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:09.994
- What costume will you wear?
- Something to surprise you.

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:12.879
Good luck.

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:28.870
Killer!
It's because of you he is dead!

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:41.558
Get out! Get out of here!
Killer, <i>voleur,</i> murderer!

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.519
John?

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:16.634
John?

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:39.797
- Will you make it hard to apologise?
- Not at all, I'm sure you're sorry.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.154
You know I am. I had no idea
of the things you were up against.

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:48.916
What are your plans now?

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.680
- Now what?
- That the cat burglar's dead.

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:55.475
Foussard isn't The Cat.
The man had a wooden leg.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:01.038
- Wasn't he trying to rob a villa?
- He was trying to kill... me.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.118
- Why?
- I was too close to The Cat.

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:08.074
- Who killed him?
- If I find out, I'll let you know.

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:11.033
- Bye, Francie.
- John, why bother?

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:17.517
- It's a hobby of mine, the truth.
- Let me do something to help you.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:22.510
No, thanks. You've made your apology.
Let's go back to mutual disregard.

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:29.669
Mr Robie, I was wrong about you,
I think. You might be wrong about me.

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.716
Well, I may never know.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:35.036
- Pardon me...
- I won't pardon you!

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:40.713
I'm in love with you.

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:48.592
- That's a ridiculous thing to say.
- Is it?

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:54.195
- To you, words are just playthings.
- Were playthings.

01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:02.915
- I'll make you a sporting offer.
- I don't know if I'm up to it now.

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.069
Get me an invitation to the Sanfords.

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:11.119
- You can't go without a costume.
- What are you wearing?

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:14.790
Louis XV. Mother and I
got them in Paris.

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:19.672
I'll phone you in a day or two.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.599
You probably wonder why I want to go.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.074
I have an idea.

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:28.990
I thought you might like to see
a real burglar in action.

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.077
Will it be dangerous?

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.114
Not for tourists.

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:25.993
We're in! Any man without a lady
on his arm can only be a policeman.

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:30.671
- My nerves could stand a drink.
- Your nerves and your mother!

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.269
There they are, Commissioner Lepic
and one of his men.

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:15.075
Wigs, pantaloons and flat feet.
Come on.

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:25.314
My heart pills! I can't drink
champagne without my pills.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:30.150
- Where do you think you left them?
- In our room. They're in my purse.

01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:35.115
- Be a sweetie, John, and get them.
- Of course. I'd be delighted.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.834
- Mother!
- All I said was...

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.554
Never mind what you said.

01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:43.196
Thank you, dear.

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:48.317
Shall we dance?

01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.277
Well, I hope the London office
appreciate what I've done for them.

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.755
My feet are killing me.

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:26.315
Mother was quite an actress.

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:29.239
She played her part well.
Heart pills!

01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:35.830
I didn't think this scheme of yours
would work, Francie. But it has.

01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:23.034
I figured it was you the night your father
died. You always did his legwork!

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:24.874
Come down!

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:42.155
Come down
or we shall be forced to shoot!

01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:17.830
- He's not The Cat!
- What does he do on that roof?

01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:20.713
- Your job.
- I only believe what I see.

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.435
- Shoot him and I'II...
- Robie's where I knew he'd be.

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.998
He's not alone up there.

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:26.639
- Pull me up!
- Don't shout, it makes me nervous.

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:29.434
- Then drop me.
- Whatever you say.

01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:32.632
You've got a full house.
Begin the performance.

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:36.628
- What performance?
- Tell them who is really who.

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.717
Please, I might slip.

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:43.198
- I can hold you for 30 seconds.
- I did it for my father.

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:47.109
That's fine, but I already know.
Tell them down there.

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:50.995
- I kill you when I get up there.
- Tell them.

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.272
I was working for my father!
Now, please!

01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:58.950
- Your father is dead. Who else?
- That's all.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.435
My fingers are beginning to open.

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:07.351
Tell them who was behind it. Who knew
as much about me as I knew? Go on!

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:12.879
- Bertani's was behind it.
- You're telling them, remember.

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:15.594
- Bertani's was behind it!
- That's right.

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:17.836
Now, please, I'll die!

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:48.316
- Who brought you here?
- The police.

01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:52.798
We'd have caught you if my dress
hadn't got caught on the gear shift.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.310
- I only just said goodbye.
- As quickly as you could.

01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:58.556
- Didn't I thank you?
- Politely.

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:01.752
You left in such a hurry
you almost ran!

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.837
I had work to do up here.

01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:08.318
Were you afraid to admit you just
can't do everything by yourself?

01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.875
You needed the help of a good woman.

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:14.072
You aren't the Ione wolf
you think you are.

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:18.717
Without you I couldn't have done it.
I needed the help of a woman.

01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:23.668
I guess I'm not the Ione wolf
I thought I was, Francie.

01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:29.436
Well, I just wanted to hear
you say that. Thank you.

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:34.237
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:52.235
So this is where you live.
Mother will love it up here!

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:09.234
