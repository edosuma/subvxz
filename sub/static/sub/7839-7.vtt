Welcome to hunt Easter egg Mayor. 

00:26.382 --> 00:29.763
And now, my wife rarely 
would like to say a few words. 

00:31.140 --> 00:32.125
Thank you, Joe. 

00:32.371 --> 00:35.039
In a few moments, the hunt will be open 

00:35.076 --> 00:38.909
Our arbitrator Easter rabbit. 

00:41.921 --> 00:42.636
Sorry, kid. 

00:42.720 --> 00:44.314
Legally, I am not allowed to shake you. 

00:44.697 --> 00:46.366
That the hunt begins. 

00:46.529 --> 00:49.910
Joe! You said that your wife was dead. 

00:50.117 --> 00:52.809
And you said that t'avais graduated from typist. 

00:53.121 --> 00:54.987
I have problems with the space bar. 

01:02.497 --> 01:05.489
Nelson, it does not count as Easter eggs. 

01:05.658 --> 01:08.043
Yeah, but it counts as breakfast ' 

01:11.393 --> 01:12.708
It's worth it. 

01:23.560 --> 01:26.094
Ralph, there is a hole in your basket. 

01:27.027 --> 01:28.496
You're the brother of Lisa. 

01:38.155 --> 01:41.014
Nobody pushed my valuable source of joy. 

01:41.855 --> 01:42.605
Oops, wrong. 

01:43.557 --> 01:44.417
I take it. 

01:44.903 --> 01:46.231
Too slow, young Joe. 

01:46.881 --> 01:48.590
Surprise, I thee steals. 

01:52.995 --> 01:54.641
Sir, would you ask the baby? 

01:55.008 --> 01:56.854
Do not worry, I just want to talk. 

02:00.092 --> 02:02.881
Silly rabbit, is hit in the ribs. 

02:13.970 --> 02:17.179
This house has such beautiful paneling. 

02:17.191 --> 02:21.680
Well, Marge, I do not think 
t'y you knew in paneling. 

02:21.815 --> 02:24.151
I read an article on this subject to the hairdresser. 

02:24.250 --> 02:28.315
Did you know that the word was not 
not a person named Wayne Scott? 

02:29.037 --> 02:30.382
It's very interesting. 

02:33.679 --> 02:35.945
You are now in the office of Mayor. 

02:36.324 --> 02:39.873
It is used by the switch 
Mayor to call his team leader. 

02:51.251 --> 02:52.852
That concludes our visit. 

02:54.078 --> 02:57.188
But it would please me if you 
come to drink tea with me at the show. 

02:57.489 --> 03:00.366
Tea? In the living room? 

03:01.649 --> 03:03.554
You're like all Easter bunny -- 

03:03.636 --> 03:05.545
Unable to take a 
punched in the balls. 

03:05.697 --> 03:07.860
Maybe next time 
t'y think twice before 

03:08.117 --> 03:11.613
to volunteer to help children. 

03:14.010 --> 03:16.054
It's my husband, Homer. 

03:17.716 --> 03:18.699
Ladies. 

03:18.974 --> 03:21.268
Margin, there will be a hole in my pants? 

03:22.853 --> 03:24.009
Homer, please ... 

03:24.279 --> 03:26.222
We are about to drink tea. 

03:26.650 --> 03:27.412
No tea. 

03:27.904 --> 03:28.840
Security. 

03:36.091 --> 03:37.695
Everyone, go ... 

03:37.917 --> 03:40.328
Or how to ruin a tea, Marge ....

03:40.556 --> 03:43.545
This is the last calendar-magnet 
refrigerator you have of me. 

03:43.839 --> 03:45.118
They throw anyway. 

03:45.376 --> 03:46.057
You lie! 

03:46.101 --> 03:46.885
Stop lying. 

03:47.651 --> 03:48.872
Hey, baby ... 

03:49.165 --> 03:52.260
You want a little sex tyrannosaurus? 

03:54.998 --> 03:56.078
No, I am not. 

03:56.423 --> 03:58.597
I'm still angry because of 
what happened today. 

03:58.930 --> 04:00.958
I have not many friends, and when finally 

04:00.971 --> 04:03.235
I do, keeps you all. 

04:03.459 --> 04:06.004
Come on, sweetie, you have lots of friends. 

04:06.115 --> 04:06.731
There ... 

04:07.910 --> 04:10.722
Lisa and ... the oven. 

04:13.861 --> 04:15.321
The poor. 

04:15.484 --> 04:17.202
I will find him a friend. 

04:17.303 --> 04:20.329
Someone cute, athletic, with a good laugh. 

04:27.118 --> 04:28.617
My husband ... 

04:28.811 --> 04:30.855
and my best friend. 

04:34.898 --> 04:37.398
It's a risk I have to be taken. 

04:40.046 --> 04:41.398
What you want, Lisa? 

04:41.605 --> 04:42.789
Opportunities for this summer. 

04:42.880 --> 04:44.248
We go to a camp for twins. 

04:45.968 --> 04:47.018
Oh, my God. 

04:47.276 --> 04:48.988
Spend a summer in Rome. 

04:49.243 --> 04:49.772
Rome? 

04:49.992 --> 04:51.702
Founded by twins, however. 

04:52.215 --> 04:53.368
Hey, where is she gone? 

04:53.617 --> 04:56.346
Let our secret language of twins. 

05:01.811 --> 05:04.652
Okay, Lisa, studying in Rome 

05:04.729 --> 05:07.771
the applicant must have very 
good grades - it's good. 

05:08.024 --> 05:11.780
Lisa is writing that you have 
speak very good Italian. 

05:12.059 --> 05:13.159
That's good. 

05:13.391 --> 05:14.632
You speak Italian? 

05:14.743 --> 05:16.777
Of course. 

05:16.925 --> 05:18.956
Why do I say otherwise? 

05:20.504 --> 05:21.549
What flawless logic. 

05:21.647 --> 05:23.553
But I will have to ask you to say 

05:23.590 --> 05:26.172
few sentences to verify your facility. 

05:26.638 --> 05:29.097
Not now, I quantity 
of important appointments. 

05:29.794 --> 05:31.039
But tomorrow it t'irait? 

05:31.797 --> 05:32.942
For me not at all. 

05:33.137 --> 05:34.963
But I come to you. Soon. 

05:37.446 --> 05:40.028
Son, I need to find a new friend to your mother. 

05:40.038 --> 05:42.141
So you must finish the race alone. 

05:42.232 --> 05:43.510
We use food stamps? 

05:43.584 --> 05:44.415
If only. 

05:44.485 --> 05:45.586
I made them to work. 

05:50.850 --> 05:53.241
I bet it would be a good friend to Marge. 

05:53.285 --> 05:55.466
It also frustrated the air. 

06:07.739 --> 06:12.169
Why all women to whom I 
talks are in canned? 

06:12.287 --> 06:14.846
I want to rent a small boat. 

06:14.979 --> 06:16.863
I want to rent a small boat. 

06:17.632 --> 06:21.681
I want to rent a small boat. 

06:22.709 --> 06:26.449
I plan to throw the body into the ocean. 

06:26.569 --> 06:29.060
I plan to throw the body into the ocean. 

06:35.031 --> 06:37.125
This is what you get by asking questions. 

06:50.508 --> 06:52.630
Goodbye, ignorance 

06:53.756 --> 06:55.367
Margin, I succeeded.

07:04.647 --> 07:06.496
I'll take a little air. 

07:08.848 --> 07:11.533
I bet you can not start 
a cat above the house. 

07:11.750 --> 07:12.820
Ah yes? 

07:15.684 --> 07:16.963
I was wrong. 

07:19.064 --> 07:23.306
Everybody Hurts ... 

07:24.449 --> 07:27.602
Sometimes ... 

07:31.628 --> 07:33.909
I guess I'm not done 
to have friends. 

07:35.246 --> 07:36.720

But Luigi, surely you speak Italian. 

12:11.719 --> 12:12.991

I speak only how to say ... 

12:14.987 --> 12:16.742
of fractured English. 

12:16.956 --> 12:19.046
That is what my parents spoke at home. 

12:23.634 --> 12:25.446
I spent a wonderful day. 

12:25.505 --> 12:27.902

12:46.943 --> 12:47.988

We have a little surprise for you. 

12:51.291 --> 12:54.862

I did not just friends, 
I have a hat to prove it. 

13:24.504 --> 13:27.976
Now, Marge, as a member of 
full, you must share all your secrets. 

13:28.217 --> 13:30.244

13:30.339 --> 13:32.540
The secret is, put apples in it. 

13:32.675 --> 13:35.995

13:54.037 --> 13:55.857
Other surprises? 

13:55.967 --> 13:57.726
I am not a natural redhead. 

14:01.442 --> 14:01.536
M Burns had promised $ 1 000 000 

14:07.609 --> 14:08.360
for the infant Springfield hospital. And then ... 

14:08.692 --> 14:18.263
Rather than give the money, I will serve 

14:18.473 --> 14:20.781

14:32.616 --> 14:34.588
Why have you brought hunting dogs 

14:34.848 --> 14:35.950
at a charity event? 

14:36.360 --> 14:37.926
I wanted them to the toileteur. 

14:38.801 --> 14:40.340
Oh, that is the stinking dog? 

14:40.577 --> 14:41.649
It's you. 

14:42.071 --> 14:43.776
Michelle will do a good job on you. 

14:43.989 --> 14:45.264
Oh yes. 

14:45.670 --> 14:48.109
There are 12 Faberge eggs in its vault 

14:48.310 --> 14:49.628
each worth a small fortune. 

14:51.570 --> 14:53.158
We can get, but we need 

14:53.486 --> 14:54.679
your unique abilities. 

14:54.954 --> 14:56.390
When I joined, I do 

14:56.646 --> 14:57.766
thought not steal people. 

14:58.179 --> 14:59.587
You said that you wanted friends. 

14:59.926 --> 15:02.411
And making friends is 
they shake the elbows, 

15:02.605 --> 15:05.502
especially trying losqu'ils 
to steal an egg to $ 1 000 000. 

15:05.885 --> 15:08.045
Maybe we've been a little quick 

15:08.231 --> 15:09.278
to give you this hat. 

15:09.762 --> 15:10.720
Take the hat! 

15:10.972 --> 15:12.771
It does not deserve to have their hair covered. 

15:12.965 --> 15:14.410
Hair naked! Hair naked! 

15:14.824 --> 15:16.206
Okay, okay, I'm yours. 

15:16.709 --> 15:18.013
Everything going well down ladies? 

15:18.315 --> 15:19.858
Sorry to wake you Stanley. 

15:20.799 --> 15:22.589
Do not leave us down, novice. 

15:25.628 --> 15:27.523
Welcome to Fox Sports West 2, FOX Sports Classic FOX. 

15:30.212 --> 15:31.315
And Marge, where you going? 

15:31.847 --> 15:34.034
Well, I'll ... 

15:34.222 --> 15:35.540
watch birds. 

15:36.846 --> 15:39.371
Wait a minute, if she goes out 
birds, why she leaves 

15:39.681 --> 15:42.570
our 'Guide Peterson birds' 
on the kitchen counter? 

15:44.857 --> 15:46.622
The Bip Bip really exist! 

15:47.409 --> 15:49.817
Milhouse I learn to speak nicely, 

15:50.126 --> 15:57.250
I am full of spirit when I'm in Italy. 

16:01.561 --> 16:04.297
What is happening here? 

16:04.887 --> 16:06.709
Angelica saves you. 

16:07.029 --> 16:08.843
But not too quickly. 

16:12.941 --> 16:16.564
It is an aperitif, but you are the main dish. 

16:16.861 --> 16:18.149
Sono cosi matto a lei! 

16:18.508 --> 16:21.005
Ho pensato abbiamo avuto qualcosa andando, 

16:21.276 --> 16:22.987
th poi prendo the con questa sgualdrina! 

16:23.259 --> 16:24.803
Lei malato me fa! 

16:25.109 --> 16:26.786
Lisa, you speak Italian perfectly! 

16:27.249 --> 16:28.442
Grazie. 

16:28.753 --> 16:30.413
Fool! 

16:30.772 --> 16:33.928
Fool! Fool! Fool! 

16:36.371 --> 16:38.048
Now that cooking is Marge. 

16:39.953 --> 16:41.061
Cooking, head dresses, 

16:41.591 --> 16:43.116
Informal agreements toaster. 

16:43.451 --> 16:45.180
Plan egg? 

16:45.587 --> 16:46.983
The residence Burns? 

16:47.257 --> 16:49.188
But it was the home of Mr Burns. 

16:56.890 --> 16:58.784
Remember me Smithers, when we will be outside 

16:59.099 --> 17:01.821
I need to reshape my eyes, 

17:02.111 --> 17:03.326
and clean my brain with vinegar. 

17:03.512 --> 17:04.321
Yes sir. 

17:04.494 --> 17:05.499
And your knees back of the store tomorrow. 

17:05.749 --> 17:06.645
Excellent. 

17:23.318 --> 17:24.579
Ok margin. 

17:24.866 --> 17:26.685
You're the only one to be fairly lean 

17:26.887 --> 17:28.310
able to move in this conduit. 

17:28.625 --> 17:29.861
That's my 'unique abilities? 

17:30.172 --> 17:31.445
Why, you thought what? 

17:31.652 --> 17:32.729
Expert in disguise? 

17:33.045 --> 17:34.192
Not with this haircut. 

17:34.469 --> 17:35.504
I thought you loved my hair. 

17:35.699 --> 17:36.874
That's good. 

17:42.940 --> 17:44.506
I must prevent margin to do something 

17:44.750 --> 17:46.429
of reckless and irresponsible. 

17:53.194 --> 17:54.154
Lou, it would well to follow. 

17:54.378 --> 17:55.993
Eddie, you take care of traffic. 

17:56.294 --> 17:57.690
You are the most gracious. 

17:58.115 --> 17:59.312
It works chief. 

18:04.946 --> 18:06.733
look at the heat this Subaru. 

18:07.136 --> 18:09.854
And this does not find a girlfriend. 

18:10.407 --> 18:11.059
I never understand. 

18:11.374 --> 18:14.114
I got the combination when I left 

18:14.296 --> 18:16.128
Burns me comfort during the Great Depression. 

18:16.559 --> 18:18.192
Zero to the right. Zero by the left. 

18:20.605 --> 18:22.882
And back to zero. 

18:31.663 --> 18:33.315
Marge, I wanted to get out of the clutches of the police, 

18:33.513 --> 18:36.632
but they followed me. 

18:36.957 --> 18:37.578
The game is over! 

18:38.027 --> 18:38.558
The game is over! 

18:38.939 --> 18:40.465
So, you show me your friends? 

18:44.566 --> 18:45.412
Do not worry Mr. Burns. 

18:45.706 --> 18:47.138
We will understand the bottom line of this case. 

18:47.403 --> 18:48.704
Excuse me Lou, I 

18:48.899 --> 18:50.061
'm supposed to say that. 

18:50.338 --> 18:51.954
Acting as the leader does not you are the leader. 

18:52.282 --> 18:54.069
If I would act as the leader, I would bring 

18:54.240 --> 18:55.994
pants size 58. 

18:56.549 --> 18:57.887
Voila, let's go for jokes about large. 

18:58.084 --> 18:59.327
You know, I just touches you targets 

18:59.635 --> 19:01.610
easy on the shooting ranges as easily. 

19:03.669 --> 19:06.825
Lou, this is why does it all wrong? 

19:07.017 --> 19:09.159
Because sometimes it is easier to be cruel 

19:09.337 --> 19:11.291
to say what we really feel. 

19:11.567 --> 19:13.439
Permission to make a calin head? 

19:13.627 --> 19:15.158
Clearance ... 

19:15.449 --> 19:17.380
Lou granted. 

19:17.660 --> 19:18.767
Chief thank you. 

19:19.015 --> 19:20.217
Enough. 

19:21.253 --> 19:23.079
While you idiots you cageolez, 

19:23.353 --> 19:24.702
someone cambriolle my house! 

19:27.844 --> 19:29.841
You try to steal my eggs? 

19:30.437 --> 19:32.574
Well, this rooster has a beak. 

19:33.011 --> 19:36.053
A beak that sows death. 

19:38.178 --> 19:39.339
Why ... You're all women. 

19:39.734 --> 19:40.722
I am not. 

19:41.083 --> 19:42.716
I believe, but I imagine that you are 

19:42.987 --> 19:44.434
now flirting. 

19:44.824 --> 19:46.485
Well, I try to spend some good times. 

19:47.700 --> 19:50.103
All I wanted is to integrate a group 

19:50.315 --> 19:52.195
of women wearing the same clothes. 

20:00.215 --> 20:01.497
No jury on earth condemn 

20:01.814 --> 20:03.213
a group of mothers in the eye moist. 

20:03.845 --> 20:05.609
I'll tell you ladies. 

20:06.734 --> 20:08.251
Make me my eggs, and I let you go. 

20:11.956 --> 20:16.435
And tell me that I'm not big. 

20:17.199 --> 20:18.393
Well, I think our attempt 

20:18.702 --> 20:19.644
to raise funds is a failure. 

20:20.220 --> 20:22.061
Do not be so certain. 

20:24.510 --> 20:25.837
Marge, I adore you. 

20:26.599 --> 20:28.130
But to be safe, I do not think we 

20:28.442 --> 20:29.873
this can review a day. 

20:31.127 --> 20:32.378
You will all really missed me. 

20:32.806 --> 20:34.345
I will never forget the 3 activities 

20:34.560 --> 20:36.246
we made together. 

20:38.726 --> 20:39.775
Listening margin. 

20:40.038 --> 20:43.022
Whatever you do in your life you will always 

20:43.361 --> 20:45.126
a friend to love you body and soul. 

20:49.752 --> 20:52.443
And Marge, there are certain things I can do 

20:52.751 --> 20:55.488
than just a friend can not. 

20:55.721 --> 20:57.170
Something special. 

21:01.829 --> 21:08.752
I can not believe I ca 2 times.
