WEBVTT

00:24.392 --> 00:26.127
What are you
doing here, Booster?

00:26.160 --> 00:27.728
Reporting for watch duty.

00:27.761 --> 00:31.299
You have never reported
for your watch duty shift.
Ever.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.734
But, hey, I'm here now.
Ready to stand watch.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.737
And I know it doesn't look
like I take my League duties
very seriously,

00:36.770 --> 00:38.639
but I really, really do.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.311
No, really, I do.

00:43.344 --> 00:44.745
BATMAN:  Fine.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.414
I'll see you in six hours.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.318
BOOSTER GOLD: You mean...
Oh...

00:51.152 --> 00:52.686
Thanks, Batsy!

00:52.720 --> 00:55.389
-You can stop
talking to me now.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.424
Done!

01:04.632 --> 01:11.339
Welcome to the Justice League
Watchtower Guided Celebrity
Tour and Souvenir Emporium!

01:15.042 --> 01:18.612
-So, how was the journey over
on my very own personal yacht?

01:18.646 --> 01:19.747
Rental.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.250
Your Captain is strange.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.684
That is Captain Skeets.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.619
Cybernaut of the seven seas.

01:25.653 --> 01:30.524
Excuse me, but your website
said we'd be greeted
by a hero.

01:30.558 --> 01:31.859
Yeah.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.227
Me.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.097
Booster Gold.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.634
The Notorious B.G.?

01:43.204 --> 01:44.872
Come on, hero from the future?

01:44.905 --> 01:46.674
You know it.

01:51.212 --> 01:54.482
Got a real bug problem here,
bruiser.

01:54.515 --> 01:59.353
And on your left the last of
our three laundry facilities.

02:01.455 --> 02:05.193
No questions? Okay, last stop,
the boiler room!

02:05.226 --> 02:06.560
MAN: I have a question.

02:06.594 --> 02:07.728
This is dull!

02:07.761 --> 02:11.765
We paid good money.
Show us your cool toys,
future boy!

02:11.799 --> 02:13.167
Oh!

02:14.268 --> 02:15.769
I know who you are.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.678
You're my favorite! Let's go.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.624
And this is Booster One,

02:37.625 --> 02:39.960
my very own private jet!

02:39.993 --> 02:44.498
Why does it say,
"Justice One"?

02:44.532 --> 02:48.302
Oh, that's a typo.
We're going to send it back
to the shop in a little bit.

02:48.336 --> 02:53.441
No offense, but
do any of the real superheroes
have aircraft?

02:53.474 --> 02:56.377
Oh, just the big guys,
like me and Bats,

02:56.410 --> 02:58.479
you know Batman.
Yeah, that's my dude. Yeah.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.649
That's one of the Batjets
over there. The ugly one.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.920
Does Wonder Woman have a jet?

03:06.954 --> 03:09.290
Uh, sure, yeah. It's, uh...

03:09.323 --> 03:10.424
It's here somewhere.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.725
Around here,
somewhere.

03:11.759 --> 03:14.295
-I don't see it.
-Ah, yeah, it's, um...

03:14.895 --> 03:16.797
It's invisible.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.667
Ooh! Did you hear that, Teddy?

03:24.772 --> 03:26.540
Tourists.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.842
This isn't the powder room.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.612
Nah, I just said that
to get you to stop asking.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.981
This is way cooler.
We call it the kitchen.

03:34.014 --> 03:37.451
-Computer, recognize
Booster Gold.

03:37.485 --> 03:38.952
COMPUTER: Invalid entry.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.554
Booster.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.990
B-O-O...

03:43.023 --> 03:45.793
COMPUTER: Recognized Boodika,
Green Lantern Corps.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.461
Initiating simulation.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.763
What, Boodika? No, no, no.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.837
-Hang on, I think I can...

03:56.870 --> 03:58.306
-Ah!

04:01.475 --> 04:02.643
You know what?
That one was me.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.345
-Okay, sorry.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.752
Okay, did anyone happen to see
where the door went?

04:15.456 --> 04:17.057
Okay.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.759
Ah!

04:37.811 --> 04:39.380
Oh, right.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.449
Automatic emergency
space-time shift.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.783
It came standard.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.753
"Space"
How far did we go?

04:45.786 --> 04:49.056
-Uh-hmm. Uh-huh.
Mmm-hmm. All right.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.891
According to
my calculations...

04:50.924 --> 04:52.726
-I have no idea.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.463
By that clock,
I'd say 35 minutes

04:55.496 --> 04:57.865
and still no ladies room.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.803
And I'm out of power again.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.405
Ugh!

05:06.474 --> 05:09.009
Uh, it looks like
it's doing something!

05:09.042 --> 05:10.578
Ah, it's just scanning us.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.045
Internal defenses.
It's no big.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.882
-COMPUTER: Suspicious device
detected.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.584
Initiating lockdown procedure.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.990
Huh What?

05:23.023 --> 05:24.825
No, it must be a malfunction.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.927
Oh, it's no malfunction!

05:29.863 --> 05:32.966
Toyman! What happened
to your mustache?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.468
You want malfunctions?

05:34.502 --> 05:36.937
Wait till my malware
infects your systems.

05:36.970 --> 05:41.108
In a few hours, your
precious League headquarters
will be history.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.110
In your face!

05:43.143 --> 05:45.379
I can't believe this!

05:45.413 --> 05:47.781
You used my innocent tour
to gain access to this room
for your own evil ends?

05:48.749 --> 05:50.484
Did you know
about this, Teddy?

05:52.553 --> 05:54.488
Your silence speaks volumes.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.925
Is he serious?

05:57.958 --> 05:59.993
COMPUTER: Rapid response team
deployed.

06:01.595 --> 06:04.097
Response team?
Is that good or bad?

06:04.131 --> 06:05.433
COMPUTER: It's bad.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.601
They're security drones.
A lot of them.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.637
They shoot stuff, and
they'll be here any second.

06:09.670 --> 06:12.139
Can't you emergency
space

06:12.172 --> 06:13.807
My suit's still recharging!

06:13.841 --> 06:15.976
No, I have to get rid
of this hacking device.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.478
Where is it, Toyman?

06:17.511 --> 06:20.448
What's up?

06:20.481 --> 06:21.749
Why are you all...

06:23.584 --> 06:25.586
-Oh!

06:25.619 --> 06:27.821
Shut it down, Toyman!
It's the only way!

06:27.855 --> 06:31.492
I can't! I made the forcefield
completely impenetrable.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.960
Why?

06:32.993 --> 06:35.729
I don't know, I'm crazy!

06:35.763 --> 06:37.164
They'll be here any second!

06:37.197 --> 06:39.767
Maybe we can stop him
with the Mother Box I brought

06:39.800 --> 06:42.536
to send the Watchtower
into the sun?

06:44.472 --> 06:47.207
What?
I'm Granny Goodness, come on.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.777
I'm barely wearing a disguise.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.879
You're telling me
that three quarters,

06:51.912 --> 06:55.783
nearly half of this tour group
have been supervillains
in disguise?

06:57.150 --> 06:59.520
Hello!

06:59.553 --> 07:01.755
BOOSTER GOLD: Are you
kidding me?

07:01.789 --> 07:04.224
I suppose you brought
some kind of poisonous gas?

07:04.257 --> 07:06.794
No, I really just
came for the tour!

07:06.827 --> 07:10.130
Got this idea from
an old Bugs Bunny cartoon.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.077
DRONE: Eradicate. Eradicate.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.178
I've doomed us all!

07:30.984 --> 07:32.720
Ah!

07:35.923 --> 07:37.825
Huh? Ah!

07:51.539 --> 07:53.574
Oh, okay. You know what?
That was the last drone.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.042
COMPUTER: Intruder alert.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.577
-Deploying additional drones.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.747
"Unknown associate"?
Oh, come on!

08:00.280 --> 08:01.715
Run!

08:10.090 --> 08:13.994
-Sure. He's in my favorites.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.829
WOMAN:  Your call
has been forwarded to

08:15.863 --> 08:18.131
-an automatic
voice message system.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.267
Batman.
...
Is not available.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.149
Not gonna lie,
that was awesome!

08:37.951 --> 08:40.020
-What about the
training kitchen we were in?

08:40.053 --> 08:41.054
Can we hide there?

08:41.088 --> 08:42.756
There's too many of them.
We'll never make it.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.059
Might be enough,
but only for one.

08:47.595 --> 08:48.929
-My bad.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.033
Hero

08:53.066 --> 08:54.167
Certainly, not today.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.004
-Run faster,
you big battleax!
-Ah!

09:11.752 --> 09:13.053
BOOSTER: Duck!

09:18.091 --> 09:21.328
I was getting a little bit
tired of all their droning on.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.930
No, no, wait.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.332
How about,
"Now, that's what I call
a Game of Drones."

09:25.365 --> 09:27.167
How about,
"Romancing the Drone"?

09:27.200 --> 09:29.670
-Yeah, that one doesn't
even make any sense, man.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.806
-In the end, they were
just flesh and drone.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.642
Hey, guys,
could you drone it down?

09:34.675 --> 09:36.944
You're good!

09:36.977 --> 09:38.612
I have to hand it to you,
Booster,

09:38.646 --> 09:42.215
using your tech to create
hologram duplicates, awesome!

09:42.249 --> 09:47.120
Yeah, Goldilocks,
even I'm impressed,
and I'm a Batman villain!

09:47.154 --> 09:49.089
Actually, these
aren't duplicates.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.959
These are real Boosters
from alternate timelines.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.961
This is Booster if I had
stayed in bed this morning,

09:53.994 --> 09:56.196
and this is Booster
from a world without love.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.699
I'm sad.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.835
We sort of have
a phone tree thing.
Everybody calls two.

10:01.869 --> 10:02.970
Hey, thanks again, guys.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.673
Here you go.
Marshmallows! What?

10:05.706 --> 10:06.974
Everybody gets one!

10:07.007 --> 10:08.241
-Got it!
-Yeah, baby!

10:08.275 --> 10:10.010
-All right!
-Sweet!

10:10.043 --> 10:12.412
-Hey, thanks, man!
You're the best!
-No, you're the best.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.814
Ciao!

10:18.986 --> 10:22.322
Not much going on
at home, huh?

10:22.355 --> 10:26.960
In conclusion,
my grossly negligent
and unlicensed tour business

10:26.994 --> 10:30.864
was actually a clever ruse to
entrap these sinister villains

10:30.898 --> 10:33.400
and foil their plots
to destroy the Watchtower.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.403
Except Joker.
He's completely innocent.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.138
I think he enjoyed
the tour, too.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.740
Uh-huh.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.274
So, you see, Batman,

10:41.308 --> 10:43.811
you're not the only one
who can keep a bunch
of plates spinning,

10:43.844 --> 10:47.280
manage every detail,
and always stay
one step ahead of disaster.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.850
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:49.883 --> 10:51.852
Skeets and I have
a boat we have to return to

10:51.885 --> 10:54.287
-yachts of fun.

10:56.724 --> 10:59.092
You might want
to avoid that door.
