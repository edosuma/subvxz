00:00.544 --> 00:02.112
_

00:02.211 --> 00:05.070
Marcus Chaplin will never fire
on a US Navy ship.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.138
Fire one.

00:06.234 --> 00:07.955
No, belay that.
Do not fire.

00:08.053 --> 00:09.003
You disobeyed my order?

00:09.112 --> 00:11.201
When I'm on the conn, my word is law!

00:11.298 --> 00:12.329
I did this for you.

00:12.425 --> 00:13.989
COB, you know we wouldn't
make a move without your go,

00:14.130 --> 00:15.571
but terminating the Captain's command

00:15.674 --> 00:17.045
may be an option we have to consider.

00:17.150 --> 00:19.019
Everybody, say hello to the XO.

00:19.128 --> 00:20.961
Marcus isn't dying.
I need to know everything.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.786
Welcome to the deep end of the pool.

00:22.895 --> 00:24.774
Senior Chief Petty Officer
Harold Anders,

00:24.882 --> 00:26.139
you're hereby relieved of duty.

00:26.251 --> 00:27.460
If it were up to me,
it'd be a lot worse.

00:27.571 --> 00:29.981
I won't have an admitted rapist
walk free on my boat.

00:30.096 --> 00:31.076
I'll see you in hell, Sir.

00:31.187 --> 00:32.264
Did they send you here to kill me?

00:32.375 --> 00:33.415
Yes, Sir.

00:33.509 --> 00:35.410
I have enemies, Cortez.

00:35.508 --> 00:36.629
I am not one of them.

00:36.735 --> 00:39.014
You'll no longer be at the mercy
of the United States.

00:39.118 --> 00:40.707
At the mercy of
the current administration.

00:40.824 --> 00:43.374
Don't ever confuse my nation
with its current ruler.

00:43.480 --> 00:44.921
There are people, powerful people,

00:45.035 --> 00:47.507
who are gathering right now,
organizing a coup d'etat.

00:47.628 --> 00:49.975
Tomorrow a marine force recon
contingent

00:50.104 --> 00:51.108
will place the President

00:51.256 --> 00:53.048
and the Vice President under arrest.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.808
Now, Mr. Speaker,
you will announce

00:54.913 --> 00:56.953
that you are assuming the presidency.

00:57.082 --> 00:58.763
This is really happening, isn't it?

01:04.257 --> 01:07.051
(Man and woman moan)

01:08.409 --> 01:09.284
(Blows air)

01:14.237 --> 01:15.636
(Exhales deeply)

01:16.286 --> 01:18.375
Do you really think
we're making it better?

01:19.101 --> 01:20.284
The sex?

01:20.522 --> 01:22.107
(Chuckles)

01:23.030 --> 01:24.760
The world.

01:26.277 --> 01:27.505
I mean, we're...

01:30.481 --> 01:32.029
we're gonna...

01:32.318 --> 01:33.524
Orchestrate a coup.

01:33.645 --> 01:35.493
You can say it out loud.

01:36.212 --> 01:38.518
It's the saying it part
that worries me.

01:40.510 --> 01:42.187
If you're gonna get Maudlin,

01:42.460 --> 01:44.806
then I'm going to Breakfast Barn.

01:46.298 --> 01:48.343
Our meeting's not
for another three hours.

01:49.020 --> 01:51.109
(Clasp snaps)

01:51.226 --> 01:52.246
And you can stop pretending

01:52.395 --> 01:53.733
that I'm the only one who's nervous.

01:53.846 --> 01:55.441
I'm not nervous.

01:56.208 --> 02:00.347
No. I've been having sex
in a random hotel room all night

02:00.461 --> 02:01.365
because the thought

02:01.498 --> 02:03.386
of sharing a wiki page
with John Wilkes Booth,

02:03.515 --> 02:04.678
that really does it for me.

02:04.792 --> 02:05.762
We're not shooting anyone.

02:05.881 --> 02:07.072
Not today.

02:07.175 --> 02:09.758
All it takes is for one thing
to go wrong.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.704
(Sighs)

02:16.185 --> 02:18.244
We're really gonna do this, aren't we?

02:19.526 --> 02:20.821
Yep.

02:21.121 --> 02:22.514
We are...

02:23.967 --> 02:25.856
today.
(Sighs)

02:30.230 --> 02:31.986
(Clattering)

02:32.476 --> 02:34.724
(Indistinct conversations)

02:39.101 --> 02:40.178
(Chaplin) The only reason I fired on

02:40.308 --> 02:42.279
a US Navy vessel
was to protect the supplies,

02:42.418 --> 02:43.659
to feed my people.

02:43.771 --> 02:45.099
I'm not your ally, Zheng.

02:45.214 --> 02:47.314
Ally, friend--
whatever you call it, Captain,

02:47.420 --> 02:50.056
I see the beginning of a new change.

02:50.177 --> 02:51.575
Something in the air.

02:51.690 --> 02:53.395
You forced me into
a dangerous PR stunt.

02:53.542 --> 02:55.415
I fail to appreciate its subtleties.

02:55.617 --> 02:57.625
Well, you provided for those in need.

02:57.740 --> 03:00.400
And today a new supply ship
is out there waiting to unload.

03:00.521 --> 03:03.846
And right here,
celebrations unfold for you.

03:04.036 --> 03:05.427
(Chuckles) This has
nothing to do with me.

03:05.527 --> 03:08.555
It's an island holiday--
the festival of Sun and Moon.

03:08.661 --> 03:10.859
Mm. Well, you know
your island well.

03:10.974 --> 03:12.972
You've been buttering my bread
pretty good this morning.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.012
Do you employ the same strategies

03:15.182 --> 03:16.733
in your meeting
with Mr. Serrat?

03:16.858 --> 03:18.660
Well, different strokes
for different folks, Captain.

03:18.773 --> 03:19.970
What's he after?

03:20.083 --> 03:21.040
That would be telling.

03:21.166 --> 03:22.622
There's only one big dog
on this island, Mr. Zheng,

03:22.728 --> 03:24.137
and you're looking at him.

03:24.529 --> 03:26.814
Don't make the mistake of trying
to play both sides.

03:26.924 --> 03:29.952
Make your choice, now.

03:35.231 --> 03:36.963
The soil here has tested very rich

03:37.099 --> 03:38.695
in some rare minerals.

03:39.392 --> 03:42.384
Mr. Serrat wants my help
in exploiting those resources.

03:42.491 --> 03:44.096
- And you promised him what?
- Nothing.

03:44.384 --> 03:47.279
As you pointed out, only one
of you has nuclear teeth.

03:47.393 --> 03:48.369
Perhaps you and I

03:48.506 --> 03:49.874
can discuss a partnership.

03:50.118 --> 03:51.808
Panning for gold,
Mr. Zheng?

03:51.927 --> 03:53.952
Compared to these minerals,
gold is cheap.

03:55.808 --> 03:55.872
I'm talking about economic freedom,

03:56.128 --> 03:58.848
the end of want.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.736
So far, you've only ruled here
by threat of violence.

04:00.867 --> 04:04.280
How long can fear be
the only currency you possess?

04:07.063 --> 04:08.145
All right.

04:09.102 --> 04:10.300
I'm listening.

04:10.725 --> 04:12.365
(Speaks inaudibly)

04:18.076 --> 04:19.586
You need to eat.

04:20.387 --> 04:22.218
I'm sure you haven't had
anything in days.

04:22.333 --> 04:23.960
- I eat. I'm fine.
- Do you sleep?

04:24.111 --> 04:25.177
Sophie, please.

04:25.311 --> 04:26.836
Because you don't seem fine.

04:27.426 --> 04:28.526
I'm fine.

04:28.647 --> 04:31.390
Look, if you want to talk
about your wife or anything--

04:31.514 --> 04:33.006
What, you want to talk about Serrat?

04:33.113 --> 04:34.080
You want to talk about that?

04:34.195 --> 04:35.424
Are you living with him now,
is that it?

04:35.512 --> 04:37.857
Yes, but it's not what you think.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.028
It's more complicated.

04:39.147 --> 04:40.197
It's more complicated.
Okay.

04:40.323 --> 04:43.008
The man is a killer, Sophie.
He is scum of the earth, okay?

04:43.181 --> 04:45.878
And you're letting him
show you off like he owns you.

04:45.990 --> 04:48.544
- Is that what you want?
- I know what I'm doing.

04:49.074 --> 04:51.817

05:10.112 --> 05:11.254
Hi.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.513
Hi.

05:14.028 --> 05:15.014
(Exhales)

05:15.112 --> 05:16.383
Where you been for the last week?

05:16.495 --> 05:17.388
I was, um,

05:17.490 --> 05:19.488
at my father's with my brother.

05:19.682 --> 05:22.061
Had a few things to sort through.

05:23.204 --> 05:25.216
Is everything all right?

05:26.217 --> 05:27.332
Yeah.

05:27.893 --> 05:29.993
(Chuckles) Well, no.

05:30.159 --> 05:31.481
It will be.

05:32.950 --> 05:35.247
I wasn't expecting you
to still be here.

05:35.359 --> 05:36.224
(Clears throat) Are you kidding?

05:36.334 --> 05:39.072
It's the closest bed
to the only bar in town.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.014
I'm, um, I'm leaving.

05:56.153 --> 05:59.200
I'm actually here just to--
to pack a few things.

05:59.314 --> 06:01.111
I'm leaving the island.

06:01.622 --> 06:02.817
Why?

06:04.935 --> 06:07.904
I'm taking my brother
back to Australia.

06:10.176 --> 06:12.049
A lot's changed.

06:12.518 --> 06:14.837
It's not safe here anymore.

06:15.886 --> 06:17.855
Because of all us cowboys.

06:18.481 --> 06:19.863
Yeah.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.855
Because of all you cowboys.

06:22.164 --> 06:23.785
I wish I could stay, but I can't,

06:24.064 --> 06:25.342
and I know you can't leave.

06:25.466 --> 06:26.891
I'll go.

06:27.483 --> 06:29.248
You don't have to say that.

06:29.345 --> 06:30.382
No.

06:30.654 --> 06:33.664
You know, I want to go with you...

06:34.854 --> 06:37.152
wherever you're going.

06:38.451 --> 06:39.927
(Sighs) Tani,

06:40.489 --> 06:42.307
I'll go.

06:44.671 --> 06:45.684
If you want.

06:45.798 --> 06:47.020
(Laughs)

06:48.564 --> 06:49.884
State-of-the-art scrambler

06:50.019 --> 06:52.064
I borrowed from the company
a while back.

06:52.185 --> 06:53.772
Very handy when you're dating
a bullfighter

06:53.897 --> 06:55.173
against your father's wishes.

06:55.279 --> 06:57.091
Well, if this communication
is intercepted--

06:57.198 --> 06:57.916
Don't worry.

06:58.023 --> 06:59.584
As long as you can get
Chaplin on the other end,

06:59.710 --> 07:00.640
you're good to go.

07:00.761 --> 07:01.682
He'll be there.

07:01.806 --> 07:03.528
A friend of a friend is helping me out.

07:04.005 --> 07:05.156
(Chaplin) All right, Cortez, I'm here.

07:05.256 --> 07:06.304
I've cleared the room.

07:06.431 --> 07:07.743
Where's my mystery guest?

07:07.910 --> 07:08.971
I don't know, Sir.

07:09.287 --> 07:11.766
I was only told it was vital
to bring you here for this.

07:12.210 --> 07:13.211
(Clicks keyboard keys)

07:13.688 --> 07:15.424
(Static crackles)

07:16.812 --> 07:18.610
Arthur.

07:19.037 --> 07:20.788
You're the last person
I expected to see.

07:20.926 --> 07:23.200
<i>Well, I apologize</i>
<i>for the extreme security,</i>

07:23.325 --> 07:24.640
<i>but I think you'll appreciate</i>
<i>the effort</i>

07:24.741 --> 07:26.476
<i>once I explain the situation.</i>

07:26.587 --> 07:28.316
Why aren't you in custody
for killing Amanda Straugh?

07:28.429 --> 07:30.078
<i>Marcus, listen, friends are gathering.</i>

07:30.199 --> 07:33.583
<i>A patriotic force</i>
<i>will depose President Bolton</i>

07:33.756 --> 07:36.287
<i>at a joint session of Congress today.</i>

07:36.288 --> 07:38.336
<i>- Now what we need from you is--</i>
- Arthur, you know that I've had

07:38.592 --> 07:40.288
nothing but tricks and traps
thrown at me.

07:40.391 --> 07:42.112
<i>How do I know there's not</i>
<i>a gun to your head right now?</i>

07:42.204 --> 07:43.866
Well, you don't have to
trust me. Just watch.

07:43.977 --> 07:46.101
Now certain facts have
recently come to light,

07:46.848 --> 07:50.024
<i>like what really happened</i>
<i>in Pakistan and to your boat.</i>

07:50.135 --> 07:51.484
<i>The truth is coming out.</i>

07:51.607 --> 07:55.106
<i>And once it does, it'll be</i>
<i>time to bring you home.</i>

07:55.207 --> 07:56.508
Sir?

07:56.629 --> 07:58.557
<i>You do want to come back, don't you?</i>

07:58.962 --> 08:00.398
I would like nothing better.

08:00.515 --> 08:02.743
<i>All right. Well, get ready to</i>
<i>make a statement later today,</i>

08:02.876 --> 08:06.304
<i>because when this comes to a head,</i>

08:06.687 --> 08:08.467
<i>the world's gonna want</i>
<i>to hear from you.</i>

08:08.575 --> 08:10.561
<i>Asia is a powder keg, so bringing you</i>

08:10.678 --> 08:12.992
<i>and your nuclear missiles happily home</i>

08:13.110 --> 08:15.188
<i>is gonna ease a lot of tension.</i>

08:15.320 --> 08:17.600
<i>Just wish us fair winds.</i>

08:17.743 --> 08:19.464
And following seas.

08:27.849 --> 08:29.497
Okay.

08:31.856 --> 08:33.996
So I'll check in
on the military stations.

08:34.119 --> 08:36.604
But essentially the pieces
are already in place.

08:36.832 --> 08:39.015
Now we just let our little
revolution out into the world

08:39.136 --> 08:40.864
and see if she can stand on her own.

08:40.972 --> 08:44.168
This is insane.
I'm not a revolutionary.

08:44.287 --> 08:45.512
I'm just a gun salesman.

08:45.628 --> 08:46.790
I mean, I'm a very good gun salesman,

08:46.928 --> 08:48.288
but I'm just a gun salesman.

08:48.405 --> 08:49.094
Stop it.

08:49.233 --> 08:51.392
The woman who accosted me
in the DOD Rotunda,

08:51.525 --> 08:52.728
worrying about her weapons system,

08:52.850 --> 08:54.088
that was a gun salesman.

08:54.214 --> 08:55.650
But the one
in front of me now--

08:55.872 --> 08:57.121
(Hopper) Forrest is missing.

08:57.224 --> 08:58.552
And I don't mean, like, overslept.

08:58.653 --> 09:00.224
No one knows where the hell she is.

09:00.347 --> 09:01.643
Okay, but that could be
anything, right?

09:01.753 --> 09:03.422
Forrest's job

09:03.557 --> 09:06.220
was to get your flash drive
to Speaker Buell

09:06.345 --> 09:08.512
and present it on the floor
of the House with him.

09:08.622 --> 09:09.937
Now Buell's already on the fence.

09:10.030 --> 09:11.130
So if we don't get him
some backup--

09:11.248 --> 09:12.736
I know. I know.
I know. I'll do it.

09:12.837 --> 09:15.008
- No, absolutely not.
- Just relax, okay?

09:15.119 --> 09:16.428
They like me at
the House of Representatives.

09:16.544 --> 09:17.996
I spend a lot of money there.

09:21.376 --> 09:22.717
(Chaplin) I need to sit down
with the XO.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.227
Sir...

09:30.560 --> 09:32.800
are you sure you can trust him?

09:34.388 --> 09:36.223
What do you know that I don't?

09:37.378 --> 09:39.567
Sam... told you

09:39.872 --> 09:41.071
that the CIA wanted the Colorado

09:41.199 --> 09:42.841
to be the resistance.

09:44.674 --> 09:47.424
But they didn't want you in charge.

09:47.636 --> 09:48.823
Just him.

09:48.946 --> 09:51.329
All he had to do
was take command of the sub.

09:51.437 --> 09:52.416
That was their offer.

09:52.536 --> 09:54.082
You're overstepping, Cortez.

09:54.578 --> 09:56.765
His wife was just killed.

09:57.652 --> 10:00.307
You know how that changes a man.

10:00.864 --> 10:01.564
Sir--

10:01.678 --> 10:03.343
Wait for me in the jeep.

10:14.336 --> 10:16.332
(Indistinct conversations)

10:18.155 --> 10:20.480
Why are there never
any sports on TV here?

10:20.591 --> 10:22.708
It's always weather or seayaks.

10:22.917 --> 10:24.704
Drink?

10:26.053 --> 10:27.577
No. I'm okay right now.
Thank you.

10:27.684 --> 10:29.323
I want you to do me a favor, Sam.

10:29.456 --> 10:33.472
I want you to have
a drink with me, man.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.828
You gonna eat that?

10:46.784 --> 10:48.808
I've seen that look before.

10:49.372 --> 10:51.623
It doesn't usually lead to good things.

10:53.525 --> 10:55.227
You want to drink?
Let's drink.

10:55.432 --> 10:57.536
(Sets glass down) Now you're talking.

11:10.368 --> 11:12.498
To all those who never make it home.

11:12.499 --> 11:13.984
And there is nothing,

11:14.094 --> 11:15.522
absolutely nothing, worth half a damn

11:15.649 --> 11:17.775
as simply messing around in boats.

11:19.445 --> 11:20.980
And to Christine.

11:24.213 --> 11:25.038
(Clinks)

11:32.064 --> 11:34.281
(Explosion)

11:35.225 --> 11:36.856
That's the supply ship.

11:37.147 --> 11:38.118
Yep.

11:38.913 --> 11:40.653
(Chaplin) Looks like their crew
made out okay.

11:40.814 --> 11:42.290
Captain, we had no sonar contacts.

11:42.407 --> 11:43.710
Nothing on radar.

11:43.823 --> 11:45.696
A fuel leak may have ignited.

11:45.855 --> 11:48.832
Captain Chaplin, I've just
spoken to my superiors,

11:48.968 --> 11:50.017
and I'm afraid my government

11:50.151 --> 11:51.762
will need a full accounting
of that event.

11:51.864 --> 11:53.129
Well, we're trying to determine
the cause of the explosion

11:53.261 --> 11:54.386
right now, Mr. Zheng.

11:54.688 --> 11:55.776
In the meantime, Lieutenant Shepard

11:55.890 --> 11:57.747
will form and oversee a recovery team.

11:57.856 --> 11:59.872
Let's get any food,
any medical supplies,

12:00.001 --> 12:00.925
anything useful and intact,

12:01.042 --> 12:02.483
- out of the water and stowed away.
- Yes, Sir.

12:02.614 --> 12:04.509
Marcus, if security becomes a problem,

12:04.622 --> 12:07.616
China's offer of assistance
may, by necessity, evolve.

12:07.739 --> 12:09.157
Sorry. To what, exactly?

12:09.886 --> 12:11.933
I'm sure you'd agree, we have
the right to defend ourselves.

12:12.320 --> 12:13.019
No, I wouldn't agree.

12:13.120 --> 12:14.731
If you'll excuse us,
Mr. Zheng.

12:19.159 --> 12:20.784
Look, I know you're going
through a lot lately,

12:20.908 --> 12:23.072
but if you're gonna drink
this early in the morning,

12:23.260 --> 12:25.671
brush your teeth before you report.

12:29.475 --> 12:31.552
It was like the 4th of July
out there, man.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.167
(Laughs) Oh, it was so...

12:35.776 --> 12:36.860
It was beautiful, COB.

12:36.996 --> 12:38.499
We set her right amidships
at the waterline.

12:38.610 --> 12:41.888
Boom. Cracked her spine like
a body slam off the top rope.

12:42.002 --> 12:42.826
Stow that crap.

12:43.232 --> 12:44.608
This isn't halftime
at the homecoming game.

12:44.711 --> 12:45.900
You guys want to get back
to the States,

12:46.112 --> 12:48.290
you need to shut up, focus up,
and get it done.

12:48.512 --> 12:49.574
Did you get eyes on the XO?

12:49.686 --> 12:51.203
Saw him talking with Chaplin
and the fortune cookie.

12:51.317 --> 12:52.579
Think Kendal's still with us?

12:52.709 --> 12:54.352
I don't wanna think.
I wanna know.

12:54.462 --> 12:55.904
Well, it ain't gonna matter
who's with us

12:56.025 --> 12:56.955
unless we secure more guns.

12:57.060 --> 12:59.810
Way ahead of you, sailor, as usual.

13:04.672 --> 13:06.253
(Serrat) Eah bo.

13:06.341 --> 13:08.629
Eah bo. (Laughs)

13:08.735 --> 13:09.661
Ah.

13:11.762 --> 13:14.014
Master Chief. The COB.

13:14.428 --> 13:17.102
You're walking. Your feet
must be killing you.

13:17.210 --> 13:18.335
I need to talk to you.

13:18.449 --> 13:19.500
You're a very courageous man.

13:19.712 --> 13:21.115
You have no fear.

13:21.474 --> 13:22.976
But of course fentanyl
is good for that.

13:23.088 --> 13:25.007
If you need some more
to keep the fear away,

13:25.126 --> 13:28.864
- just talk to Armand.
- No, I'm good.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.376
Let's you and me talk about
making the sub

13:30.498 --> 13:30.912
and everyone on board disappear.

13:31.433 --> 13:32.924
Mm-hmm.
I have heard rumors.

13:33.048 --> 13:34.444
Discontent amongst your men.

13:34.562 --> 13:36.366
Cut the crap, jocko.

13:38.208 --> 13:41.152
You want us gone.
I want to be gone.

13:41.283 --> 13:41.728
You have guns.
I need 'em.

13:41.823 --> 13:43.645
And how do you propose to pay
for these guns you say you want?

13:43.754 --> 13:45.130
By getting the USS Colorado

13:45.245 --> 13:47.681
out of your business, permanently.

13:48.085 --> 13:49.660
You interested?

14:03.872 --> 14:04.927
You're late.

14:05.062 --> 14:06.377
I'm sorry, Sir.
It was hard to slip away.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.288
You should've warned me
about the supply ship.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.737
I didn't know.

14:10.943 --> 14:12.872
Prosser keeps the big things
to himself.

14:12.976 --> 14:14.554
He gives me smaller jobs to do.

14:14.659 --> 14:18.048
I'm supposed to get the key
to the Colorado's armory.

14:18.152 --> 14:18.945
Well, that's not gonna help.

14:19.060 --> 14:20.320
The sub's firearms
are no longer accessible.

14:20.432 --> 14:21.984
I switched out the locks.
Where's the XO on this?

14:23.168 --> 14:25.216
He didn't tell you?

14:25.432 --> 14:26.792
The XO walked in on a meeting,

14:26.917 --> 14:28.161
and they chased him.

14:29.927 --> 14:31.262
Sir, I think...

14:32.515 --> 14:34.688
I think Prosser knows about me.

14:35.753 --> 14:37.984
I mean, he looks at me,
and I swear to God, he can--

14:38.100 --> 14:39.536
I would get that out of my head, son.

14:39.639 --> 14:41.792
You were brave enough to
threaten my sub with a grenade.

14:41.905 --> 14:43.511
You're brave enough to save her.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.762
What, are you insane?
I'm telling you,

14:46.880 --> 14:48.977
the Chinese are just looking
for an excuse to get into it.

14:49.110 --> 14:51.081
You blow up their boat,
you hand it to them.

14:51.429 --> 14:53.800
Let 'em come.
I'd prefer an honest fight.

14:53.925 --> 14:55.176
Joe, you're gonna get everybody killed.

14:55.284 --> 14:56.290
No, you are.

14:56.420 --> 14:58.248
First on that list is Marcus Chaplin.

14:58.366 --> 14:59.488
Look, maybe you don't want to lead,

14:59.604 --> 15:01.312
and maybe you just don't
want to lead this way.

15:01.454 --> 15:02.683
I sure as hell
can't fault you for that,

15:02.795 --> 15:03.855
but this is gonna happen.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.701
So let me talk to him. Let me
talk to the Captain then.

15:05.999 --> 15:08.294
More talk isn't getting anybody home.

15:08.855 --> 15:09.746
Then time, COB.

15:09.865 --> 15:10.945
I need more time then.

15:11.056 --> 15:13.848
You got four hours, XO.
Make 'em count.

15:26.112 --> 15:28.512
Half these things
don't even have labels.

15:28.644 --> 15:30.297
And I can't read half of them anyway.

15:30.449 --> 15:30.624
At least the tide's coming in now.

15:31.626 --> 15:32.859
Listen...

15:33.792 --> 15:34.976
I'm concerned about the Captain

15:35.264 --> 15:36.832
and the decisions
he's been making lately.

15:38.048 --> 15:40.098
I think we need to do something.

15:41.902 --> 15:44.448
You were on board when he fired
on the Patrick Lawrence, yes?

15:45.070 --> 15:46.566
He was protecting the supply ship.

15:46.689 --> 15:48.640
But if you hadn't intervened,
would Marcus Chaplin

15:48.775 --> 15:50.921
have killed everyone
on board of a US Navy vessel

15:51.056 --> 15:52.800
to protect a Chinese supply ship?

15:52.913 --> 15:55.328
The US was trying
to starve us, kill us.

15:55.543 --> 15:56.738
He didn't have a choice.

15:56.877 --> 15:58.372
Surrender is a choice.

15:58.482 --> 16:00.096
Going home and facing the music,

16:00.512 --> 16:02.847
it's a choice.

16:02.848 --> 16:05.088
Article 10-88 provides for

16:05.472 --> 16:06.464
the relief of a commanding officer

16:06.880 --> 16:07.232
by a subordinate--

16:07.329 --> 16:08.531
You're talking about mutiny.

16:08.680 --> 16:09.536
Grace, we are on a bad course,

16:09.657 --> 16:11.296
heading into dangerous water here.

16:11.408 --> 16:13.210
Well, it's still mutiny, and...

16:13.672 --> 16:15.712
it's the Captain.

16:15.823 --> 16:16.647
I know.

16:16.753 --> 16:18.429
But I don't see another option.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.115
Do you?

16:42.592 --> 16:44.056
Oh, excuse me, miss.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.184
I think you dropped this.

16:45.275 --> 16:46.849
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.

16:46.961 --> 16:48.864
That's my lucky $2 bill.
I'm gonna need that back.

16:48.969 --> 16:50.085
Hopper, what are you doing here?

16:50.192 --> 16:51.809
I found Forrest.
She's dead.

16:51.908 --> 16:53.024
Traffic accident.

16:53.118 --> 16:54.719
"Accident" accident or murder accident?

16:54.819 --> 16:56.767
Not sure, but I thought
you'd want to know

16:56.902 --> 16:58.528
before going inside.

16:58.743 --> 16:59.864
What if I get in there,

16:59.976 --> 17:01.888
and they're all just waiting for me?

17:03.584 --> 17:04.515
Badge.

17:04.638 --> 17:06.159
Oh, yeah.

17:06.996 --> 17:08.060
Um...

17:09.233 --> 17:10.226
I...

17:12.352 --> 17:13.944
I must have left it in my overcoat.

17:14.060 --> 17:17.215
I'm... so I'll
see you later.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.232
Wait.

17:22.881 --> 17:24.546
Keep it.

17:26.199 --> 17:27.872
Badge.

18:33.171 --> 18:34.344
(Sets parking brake)

18:38.336 --> 18:40.032
(Clicks release)

18:46.249 --> 18:48.512
In a few hours, an attempt will be made

18:50.041 --> 18:53.600
to remove President Bolton from office.

18:55.455 --> 18:56.588
What do you mean?

18:56.732 --> 18:59.699
A coup, led by Admiral Shepard
and others,

18:59.827 --> 19:01.247
intends to depose the President,

19:01.368 --> 19:04.159
making it possible for me
to surrender the Colorado

19:04.160 --> 19:06.432
and for us all to go back home.

19:07.168 --> 19:08.228
Where are you getting this?

19:08.800 --> 19:11.295
- I spoke to Admiral Shepard this morning.
- Admiral Shepard?

19:11.552 --> 19:13.281
And what if it's another trick,
Marcus, huh,

19:13.482 --> 19:15.833
another government trap, what then?

19:16.096 --> 19:17.692
I don't believe it is.

19:18.656 --> 19:20.096
You know, we got
real problems going on here,

19:20.219 --> 19:21.220
right here, right now.

19:21.333 --> 19:24.736
I don't think it's that wise
to be pinning all our hopes

19:24.851 --> 19:26.474
on some pipe dream.

19:26.614 --> 19:27.936
Do you?

19:30.304 --> 19:33.151
I know what Prosser
and Hawkes are up to.

19:33.152 --> 19:34.852
What are you up to, Sam?

19:37.795 --> 19:40.128
What I'm asking for is a few hours

19:40.422 --> 19:42.419
before you condemn me, too.

19:52.672 --> 19:53.995
(Clicks)

19:54.686 --> 19:56.427
(Metal clattering)

20:07.597 --> 20:09.281
These last ones are crap.

20:09.405 --> 20:10.848
Let's just forget 'em.

20:11.078 --> 20:13.697
Those guns are fine pieces
of American craftsmanship.

20:13.807 --> 20:15.904
It's the idiot who doesn't know
how to strip it or ship it

20:16.192 --> 20:16.925
that's the problem.

20:17.032 --> 20:18.816
Why don't you just worry
about your own load, shakes?

20:23.712 --> 20:25.489
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.332
Should I try that with my weapon?

20:33.616 --> 20:34.655
(Thuds)

20:35.821 --> 20:37.632
Break it down and do it right.

20:38.062 --> 20:38.602
(Metal clanks)

20:38.716 --> 20:40.687
We need every weapon we got.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.595
Well, now ain't that cozy?

21:18.774 --> 21:20.083
You fellas going steady again?

21:20.227 --> 21:21.308
It's not what you think.

21:21.412 --> 21:22.130
Prove it.

21:22.234 --> 21:23.045
I need more time.

21:23.146 --> 21:24.686
Forget it. That song
done played already.

21:24.792 --> 21:25.685
I'm in. I'm in.

21:25.788 --> 21:27.283
I just-- I-I need to secure
the right people.

21:27.388 --> 21:28.240

21:55.136 --> 21:57.618
Hey, hey, it's important.
Here. Take this.

21:57.763 --> 21:59.519
If something should happen
to both me and the Captain,

21:59.617 --> 22:01.184
I need to make sure
the people on this list

22:01.357 --> 22:03.808
don't take control of the Colorado.

22:04.677 --> 22:05.997
Make sure how?

22:08.798 --> 22:10.038
Your COB's the first name on here, Sam.

22:10.153 --> 22:11.965
If this goes the way I want it
to, you can tear that up.

22:12.192 --> 22:12.832
And if it doesn't?

22:12.950 --> 22:14.008
If it doesn't, I need
someone I can trust

22:14.400 --> 22:16.628
that's gonna look after
the ship and the crew.

22:16.755 --> 22:18.888
If you're not that person,
you say it now.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.542
Yeah.

22:29.971 --> 22:31.353
(Tani) Sellicks Beach.

22:31.489 --> 22:33.862

You'll like it.

22:34.044 --> 22:38.367

to big white sandy beaches.

22:38.368 --> 22:39.718

22:39.824 --> 22:42.287
Good fishing.
Plenty for you to do.

22:43.808 --> 22:45.433
It sounds great.

22:45.559 --> 22:47.257
Really nice.

22:48.288 --> 22:49.645
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

22:49.755 --> 22:50.936
There's just a lot going on here,

22:51.053 --> 22:52.512
and XO wants me
to make sure that--

22:52.627 --> 22:54.304
It's okay. I understand.
I'll wait.

22:54.426 --> 22:56.223

22:56.224 --> 22:57.183
Really bad.

22:57.440 --> 22:58.848
I don't want you to be a part of it.

22:59.172 --> 23:01.696
I'll go inland to my father's
with my brother,

23:01.824 --> 23:02.792

23:03.104 --> 23:05.600

23:05.824 --> 23:06.751
Not for me.

23:06.861 --> 23:08.000

23:08.320 --> 23:10.048
Look, you don't understand
who you're talking to.

23:10.673 --> 23:12.000
I'm not the guy you go to

23:12.113 --> 23:14.597

on a white sandy beach.

23:15.093 --> 23:17.664
I'm the guy you go to
when you need a throat cut.

23:17.777 --> 23:19.579
So take your brother and go.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.076

23:23.203 --> 23:25.030
You said you wanted to go with me.

23:25.151 --> 23:27.424
Now I'm saying I'll stay with you.

23:27.548 --> 23:29.330
Yeah, that won't work.
(Sniffs)

23:30.227 --> 23:32.098

23:32.216 --> 23:33.152

23:33.263 --> 23:34.788

23:35.038 --> 23:35.863

23:36.035 --> 23:39.680

23:39.807 --> 23:41.101
Now if you think
that's worth staying for,

23:41.230 --> 23:43.904

desperate than I thought.

23:46.082 --> 23:47.287

24:04.341 --> 24:06.146
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Anywhere is fine.

24:08.342 --> 24:10.260
You're a lot closer to
your academy days than I am.

24:10.369 --> 24:12.064
You still have
your reef points memorized?

24:12.204 --> 24:14.847
I'm trying to recall
the John Paul Jones quote

24:14.848 --> 24:16.672

24:16.922 --> 24:18.206
I can find out.

24:18.391 --> 24:21.536
I know how it starts.

24:21.649 --> 24:23.441
I'm just trying to
work through how it ends.

24:23.678 --> 24:26.017
- Yes, Sir.
- Wait.

24:31.104 --> 24:33.535
The XO...

24:33.536 --> 24:35.968
does he seem like himself these days?

24:36.086 --> 24:37.504
Yes, Sir. He...

24:38.656 --> 24:40.112
yes.

24:43.264 --> 24:44.174
I bring you blindfolded

24:44.317 --> 24:45.696
to the edge of a cliff, Lieutenant,

24:45.827 --> 24:47.388
and I tell you to jump,

24:47.629 --> 24:49.965
that it'll be okay
and you won't be hurt.

24:50.836 --> 24:51.742
(Rustles pages)

24:51.743 --> 24:52.651
I'd jump then, Sir.

24:52.764 --> 24:54.560
You can feel the wind on your face.

24:54.841 --> 24:57.280
You can hear the roar
of the ocean below.

24:57.398 --> 25:00.135
Your senses tell you that
you're on the edge of a cliff.

25:00.495 --> 25:02.592

25:03.439 --> 25:04.555

25:04.690 --> 25:08.000
Why? I haven't always
trusted you.

25:09.037 --> 25:10.912

25:20.105 --> 25:21.177

25:23.584 --> 25:25.708

25:25.948 --> 25:28.688

on that island.

isn't gonna be a winner.

Excuse me.

(Lowered voice) Hey.

26:06.775 --> 26:09.600

26:13.439 --> 26:15.218

- Sure.

26:54.491 --> 26:56.205

26:57.200 --> 26:58.633
Now you and the Captain...

26:58.752 --> 27:00.640
No one believes in anyone any longer.

27:00.787 --> 27:01.920
I know it's a lot to ask,

27:02.044 --> 27:03.263
but for now, you need to trust me.

27:03.374 --> 27:05.103
That's the problem here.
Everyone wants trust.

27:05.223 --> 27:07.039

So many lies.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.733

27:09.312 --> 27:10.689

27:10.816 --> 27:12.655

I know you're in a lot of pain,

27:19.697 --> 27:21.191
