- Peggy!

Peg was my younger sister.

lower her into the tub.

Can I... can I call you Nicole?

01:15.359 --> 01:18.156
I think you, like the patients
at your hospice,

01:18.181 --> 01:20.021
have been victims of a manipulative,

01:20.046 --> 01:23.243
dangerous and ruthless
woman posing as a doctor.

01:23.268 --> 01:25.173
My sister <i>is</i> a doctor.

Yes, but I also believe
that she is a murderer.

01:31.158 --> 01:33.906

quarter will get you 25 cents."

It's actually "that and an eyewitness
will get me a conviction."

01:37.393 --> 01:38.786
An eyewitness?

01:39.165 --> 01:42.031
Well, someone... who saw Dr. Harris

dose of pentobarbital.

that never happened.

Miss Mitchell, let me rephrase.

I don't actually think you're innocent.

01:56.396 --> 01:58.864
I think you know exactly
what your sister does at Joys.

known what she's done.
