00:21.266 --> 00:22.700
let's try
the tree pose.

00:22.767 --> 00:25.700
- Ah, yes. The tree pose.
- Tree pose.

00:25.767 --> 00:27.300
Of course.
Not a problem.

00:27.367 --> 00:29.200
Here is the tree, ah,

00:29.266 --> 00:33.100
and now I will
just strike a pose.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.233
Aah! Ow!

00:35.300 --> 00:36.266
Grover: Yoga
is a lot harder

00:36.333 --> 00:37.266
than it looks.

00:37.333 --> 00:38.700
Grover,
that is not yoga.

00:38.767 --> 00:40.600
- Nope, but we can learn

Leela:
All right. One last inhale...

01:18.333 --> 01:21.633
and when you exhale,
go deeper if you can,

01:21.700 --> 01:23.533
- and great, guys.
- Elmo: OK.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.066
Come on up.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.533
Good job.
All right, last one.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.667
Elmo: OK.

01:29.734 --> 01:30.900
For this last one,

01:30.967 --> 01:32.467
we're gonna do a variation
of the flamingo pose.

01:32.533 --> 01:33.567
You guys ready?

01:33.633 --> 01:34.700
- Elmo: Yeah.
- Rosita: Mm-hmm.

01:34.767 --> 01:35.700
All right. Breathe in.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.333
Breathe out.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.600
Leela:
Arms up, palms together.

01:42.667 --> 01:43.734
Elmo: OK.

01:46.266 --> 01:48.133
Arms out.

01:50.734 --> 01:53.367
Hi. Welcome
to Sesame Street.

01:53.433 --> 01:54.367
I'm going over
to Hooper's store

01:54.433 --> 01:55.433
for some breakfast.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.800
It's pretty early.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.433
They may not
be open yet,
but I-- oh!

01:58.500 --> 01:59.500
Leela: All right. Arms up.

01:59.567 --> 02:01.667
Hey...

02:01.734 --> 02:06.500
Look at that.
What are they doing?

02:06.567 --> 02:08.500
Leg up.

02:08.567 --> 02:11.567
Telly: What is that?
It's unbelievable.

02:11.633 --> 02:15.266
And exhale.

02:15.333 --> 02:17.233
All right.
Come out of it.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.266
That's it for today.
Thanks, guys.

02:19.333 --> 02:20.767
Great job. Namaste.

02:20.834 --> 02:22.400
Everyone: Namaste.

02:22.467 --> 02:25.200
Leela! Leela! Ooh,
ooh, ooh, Leela...

02:25.266 --> 02:26.533
Hey, Telly.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.767
What were you
just doing?

02:28.834 --> 02:30.533
Oh, it's a special
kind of exercise

02:30.600 --> 02:32.133
that comes from India.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.567
- It's called yoga.
- It's called yoga.

02:33.633 --> 02:34.734
Yeah, and all
that breathing

02:34.800 --> 02:35.767
and stretching
makes you feel good,

02:35.834 --> 02:36.900
doesn't it, Alan?

02:36.967 --> 02:38.066
Alan: It sure does.

02:38.133 --> 02:39.100
Hey, come on, Chris.

02:39.166 --> 02:40.300
- OK.

02:40.367 --> 02:41.767
- See you.

02:41.834 --> 02:45.433
Yoga from India...
and I missed it.

02:45.500 --> 02:49.266
I missed the whole thing.
I want to do yoga, too.

02:49.333 --> 02:51.667
I want to do yoga,
but it's--it's too late.

02:51.734 --> 02:54.133
It's too late!

02:54.200 --> 02:56.567
- Telly, Telly--
- Telly, calm down. Telly.

02:56.633 --> 02:59.367
- It's not too late, Telly.
- No. It's not.

02:59.433 --> 03:00.467
Yeah. You know,

03:00.533 --> 03:02.567
Elmo and I did
all the yoga exercises,

03:02.633 --> 03:04.400
and we can
teach them to you.

03:04.467 --> 03:06.033
- Yeah.

03:06.100 --> 03:07.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look, Telly. Look, Telly.

03:09.367 --> 03:13.166
This is called
the "frog pose," OK,

03:13.233 --> 03:16.066
and this one is called...

03:16.133 --> 03:19.233
the "crescent moon,"
and this one is called--

03:19.300 --> 03:20.533
I want to learn
the one you were
doing before.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.000
- Oh--

03:22.066 --> 03:24.333
He wants to learn
the flamingo pose.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.700
Ah.

03:25.767 --> 03:29.867
The flamingo. Yes.
Teach me the flamingo.

03:29.934 --> 03:32.333
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The flamingo is fun, Telly.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.400
Yep, but it's
a little tricky.

03:35.467 --> 03:37.300
I don't care.
Just tell me what do to.

03:37.367 --> 03:41.433
Well, the first thing
Telly has to do is breathe.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.100
I'm breathing now.
What's next?

03:45.300 --> 03:46.600
No, no, no.
No, Telly.

03:46.667 --> 03:49.367
Telly has to do
a special yoga breathing.

03:49.433 --> 03:51.100
- Mm-hmm.

03:51.166 --> 03:52.600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:52.667 --> 03:57.200
First, you breathe in,
but very slowly.

03:57.266 --> 03:59.266
- Very slowly.
- Mm-hmm.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.467
- Good.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.900
Then breathe out
very slowly,

04:04.967 --> 04:07.233
slowly, slowly. Good.

04:07.300 --> 04:10.300
Wow. That was good
yoga breathing, Telly.

04:10.367 --> 04:12.133
I'm doing it--
I'm doing it. Ha ha!

04:12.200 --> 04:13.133
- I'm doing the flamingo.
- Good!

04:13.200 --> 04:14.133
Now what?

04:14.200 --> 04:15.300
- Good. OK.
- OK. OK.

04:15.367 --> 04:16.667
Well, now arms up.

04:16.734 --> 04:18.233
- Arms up.
- Up.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.066
Arms up.

04:20.133 --> 04:21.300
- Good, Telly.

04:21.367 --> 04:24.567
- Arms out.

04:24.633 --> 04:26.266
- Out.
- Out. Good, Telly.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.800
- OK.
- Now, leg up.

04:28.867 --> 04:32.100
- Up.
- Leg up.

04:32.166 --> 04:33.233
- Mm-hmm.
- Up. Up.

04:33.300 --> 04:34.867
- Aah!
- Aah! ¡Ay, mama!

04:34.934 --> 04:37.700
- Telly fell down. Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha! A little bit.

04:37.767 --> 04:40.900
I know I fell down,
Elmo, but

04:40.967 --> 04:42.300
You didn't fall down.

04:42.367 --> 04:44.633
No one fell down
in front of Leela.

04:44.700 --> 04:47.066
Well, watch Elmo
and Rosita, Telly.

04:47.133 --> 04:48.333
Elmo and Rosita
will show you

04:48.400 --> 04:49.367
how to do it.

04:49.433 --> 04:51.166
You, too. Come on.

04:51.233 --> 04:52.533
Help us show Telly

04:52.600 --> 04:54.066
how to to do
the flamingo pose.

04:54.133 --> 04:55.367
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.233
- Arms up. Arms out.
- Arms up. Out. Leg up.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.367
Leg up. Up, up.
Keep the leg up.

05:04.433 --> 05:06.333
- Yeah. Yeah. Ohh!
- OK. OK. Good.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.700
Now, does Telly think
Telly's got it now?

05:08.767 --> 05:11.233
I don't think
I've got it, Elmo.

05:11.300 --> 05:14.266
- I know I've got it.
- Oh, yay!

05:14.333 --> 05:16.166
Oh, great, great, great.
OK. OK. Ready

05:16.233 --> 05:17.300
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Breathe in.

05:17.367 --> 05:19.133
- OK. Breathe in.
- Breathe in.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.333
- Breathe out.
- Breathe out.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.667
- Elmo and Rosita: Arms up.
- Arms up.

05:21.734 --> 05:23.133
- Arms out.
- Arms out.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.500
- Leg up.
- Leg up.

05:24.567 --> 05:27.200
- Ohh!
- Ohh...

05:27.266 --> 05:29.300
- Ha ha ha!
- Ohh...

05:29.367 --> 05:31.467
Oh, I can't
believe this.

05:31.533 --> 05:32.500
Every time
I lift my leg,

05:32.567 --> 05:33.834
I fall down.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.433
I'm never gonna learn
the flamingo, never, nev--

05:36.500 --> 05:39.200
Telly, Telly,
don't give up.

05:39.266 --> 05:42.300
This time,
I've got an idea.

05:42.367 --> 05:44.066
What is it?
- Yeah.

05:44.133 --> 05:45.200
Yeah, yeah.
Let me tell you--

05:45.266 --> 05:46.433
When you stick
your arms up,

05:46.500 --> 05:47.467
you know, and then out...

05:47.533 --> 05:50.100
- Elmo will hold one arm.

05:50.166 --> 05:52.800
I'll hold the other,
and we won't let go

05:52.867 --> 05:54.633
until you're balanced.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.467
Wow! That's
a great idea, Rosita.

05:56.533 --> 05:59.200
- Gracias.
- Let's do it.

05:59.266 --> 06:01.633
- OK.
- OK, then. Ha ha ha!

06:01.700 --> 06:03.066
- OK. Ready.

06:03.133 --> 06:04.066
- Ready.

06:04.133 --> 06:05.400
- Breathe in.
- Breathe in.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.667
- Arms up.
- Arms up.

06:08.734 --> 06:10.200
- Arms out.
- Arms out.

06:10.266 --> 06:11.700
- And...
- Let me hold your hand.

06:11.767 --> 06:13.266
- Yeah. Elmo has it, and...
Got it?

06:13.333 --> 06:14.834
- OK.
- OK. OK. Got it.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.700
- And leg up.
- Leg up.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.700
- Oh, good, Telly. Good.
- Good, good, good, good.

06:19.767 --> 06:21.433
- Good, good, good.
- Balance. Balance.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.333
- Uh...
- Uh-oh. OK. Elmo got you.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.633
- Oh, oh, oh.
- OK. OK.

06:24.700 --> 06:25.700
- Got you. Got you.
- OK.

06:25.767 --> 06:27.200
- OK.

06:27.266 --> 06:28.600
You can let go now.

06:28.667 --> 06:31.633
Is Telly sure...
that Telly is balanced?

06:31.700 --> 06:33.066
I'm sure, Elmo.

06:33.133 --> 06:35.333
Is Telly
absolutely balanced?

06:35.400 --> 06:37.500
Elmo, I've never been
so sure of anything

06:37.567 --> 06:39.300
in my entire life.

06:39.367 --> 06:40.767
OK. Elmo's
gonna let go.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.266
Me, too. OK.
Here-- let go.

06:43.333 --> 06:46.066
- Let go.
- OK.

06:46.133 --> 06:48.200
- Hey, yeah! Watch out!
- Ohh!

06:48.266 --> 06:50.100
I got it. I got it.
I know what went wrong.

06:50.166 --> 06:51.333
- I know what went wrong.
What

06:51.400 --> 06:52.467
What's wrong, Telly?
What's wrong?

06:52.533 --> 06:53.633
My elbows.

06:53.700 --> 06:55.333
One of them is heavier
than the other one.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.767
- Yes.

06:57.834 --> 07:01.834
I always suspected it,
but now I know it's true.

07:01.900 --> 07:06.467
This elbow weighs more
than the other elbow,

07:06.533 --> 07:07.767
so when I try
to balance,

07:07.834 --> 07:09.533
the side
with the heavier elbow

07:09.600 --> 07:11.433
pulls me over.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.600
Now, I'll never be able
to balance myself--

07:13.667 --> 07:15.033
never, never.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.433
It's my elbows. Ohh!

07:16.500 --> 07:18.633
- Wait a minute, Telly.
What?

07:18.700 --> 07:20.300
Telly, maybe you can.

07:20.367 --> 07:22.100
- Mm-hmm.

07:22.166 --> 07:25.600
Well, if the problem is one
side of you is heavier

07:25.667 --> 07:27.467
- than the other,
- Uh-huh.

07:27.533 --> 07:29.567
we need to make
your weight

07:29.633 --> 07:33.367
the same on both sides
for you to balance

07:33.433 --> 07:35.200
and not fall down.

07:35.266 --> 07:37.033
Do you think
that will work?

07:37.100 --> 07:39.333
Mm, let's experiment and see.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.133
We need something
for you to hold

07:41.200 --> 07:44.700
to make your light
side heavier.

07:44.767 --> 07:48.400
Ooh, well, how about--
how about this rock.

07:48.467 --> 07:51.200
Ooh, perfect.
Give it to Telly, Elmo.

07:51.266 --> 07:52.767
Telly, which hand?

07:52.834 --> 07:55.166
Well, this is the side
with the lighter elbow.

07:55.233 --> 07:56.333
Oh, good. Mm-hmm.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.667
- OK.

07:57.734 --> 08:00.166
I got it. Oh! Whoa.
OK. Ready. Ready.

08:00.233 --> 08:02.166
Perfect. OK.
Breathe in.

08:02.233 --> 08:04.367
- Breathe in.

08:04.433 --> 08:05.500
- Arms up.
- Arms up.

08:05.567 --> 08:07.667
- Arms out.
- Arms out.

08:07.734 --> 08:09.467
- Leg up.
- Leg up.

08:09.533 --> 08:12.734
- Ha ha ha!
- Aah! Oh!

08:12.800 --> 08:15.066
Now I think the side
with the rock is too heavy.

08:15.133 --> 08:17.033
- It is heavy.
- Yeah.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.600
Telly--Telly needs
to add something

08:19.667 --> 08:21.300
on the other side

08:21.367 --> 08:23.633
to make it
weigh the same.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.467
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, here. Here.

08:25.533 --> 08:26.867
Hold this salt shaker.

08:26.934 --> 08:29.233
- Oh, OK.
- All right. Got it.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.567
- Great. Here we go.
- OK.

08:31.633 --> 08:33.100
- Breathe in.
- Breathe in.

08:34.633 --> 08:36.100
- Arms up.
- Arms up.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.166
- Arms out.
- Arms out.

08:37.233 --> 08:38.433
- Leg up.
- Leg up.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.700
- Uh...
- Oh, oh, oh, oh...

08:39.767 --> 08:41.600
Aah!

08:41.667 --> 08:43.600
- ¡Ay, mama!
- ¡Ay, mama!

08:43.667 --> 08:45.500
OK. That's all of them.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.066
Thank you. OK.

08:47.133 --> 08:48.233
Rosita:
Breathe in.

08:48.300 --> 08:50.166
Telly and Elmo: Breathe in.

08:50.233 --> 08:51.700
Rosita:
Breathe out.

08:51.767 --> 08:53.433
Telly and Elmo: Breathe out.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.166
Rosita: Arms up.

08:55.233 --> 08:57.967
Telly and Elmo: Arms up.

08:58.033 --> 09:00.500
Sounds like another
yoga class. Hmm.

09:00.567 --> 09:01.800
- Leg up.
- Leg up.

09:01.867 --> 09:04.400
Huh! Ohh...

09:04.467 --> 09:06.633
No, no, no, no, no!

09:06.700 --> 09:07.734
Heavier roller skate.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.233
We need a heavier
roller skate.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.066
Uh, guys, guys,
excuse me.

09:11.133 --> 09:12.767
What's going on here?

09:12.834 --> 09:14.100
I'm learning yoga, Chris.

09:14.166 --> 09:16.433
I'm learning the flamingo pose.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.633
And this is how
you're learning

09:17.700 --> 09:19.100
the flamingo pose?

09:19.166 --> 09:20.367
Well, Telly was
having trouble

09:20.433 --> 09:22.266
keeping his balance, Chris.

09:22.333 --> 09:24.266
Yeah, and he decided
it was because

09:24.333 --> 09:25.800
one of his elbows
weighed more

09:25.867 --> 09:27.300
than the other one.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.667
- Yeah.
- I've always suspected, Chris.

09:29.734 --> 09:30.700
Ever since I was
a little child,

09:30.767 --> 09:32.200
my elbows have been--

09:32.266 --> 09:34.266
- Oh, OK. Hey, Tell...

09:34.333 --> 09:35.500
What's with all
this stuff here?

09:35.567 --> 09:36.900
Well, we kept
adding things

09:36.967 --> 09:38.300
to try to get

09:38.367 --> 09:39.600
the two sides
of his body

09:39.667 --> 09:40.967
- to weigh the same...
- Yeah.

09:41.033 --> 09:42.467
so he could balance, Chris.

09:42.533 --> 09:44.567
And I think I've almost
got it, Chris.

09:44.633 --> 09:46.633
I just need a slightly
bigger roller skate here.

09:46.700 --> 09:48.333
Whoa, whoa, Telly.
Telly, no, no, no, no.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.033
You don't need roller skates
or my salt shaker.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.700
or an oversized spoon.

09:52.767 --> 09:54.100
No, buddy. You don't need
any of these things,

09:54.166 --> 09:55.200
and you don't have to worry

09:55.266 --> 09:56.700
about how much
your elbow weighs.

09:56.767 --> 09:59.567
All you have to do
is find your balance point.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.333
Find my balance point?
Oh, OK.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.133
I can do that.
Oh, where should I look?

10:04.200 --> 10:05.400
Do they have them
at Hooper's store?

10:05.467 --> 10:06.767
No, no, no, Telly.
Telly, Telly, Telly,

10:06.834 --> 10:09.233
See, you just have
to look for it inside you.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.600
It's inside you.
You just have to feel it.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.233
How?

10:13.300 --> 10:15.166
Uh, I'll show you. See?

10:15.233 --> 10:16.166
I have my tray,

10:16.233 --> 10:17.567
and I have
my napkin holder here.

10:17.633 --> 10:18.567
See, I have to find

10:18.633 --> 10:20.667
its balance point right here.

10:20.734 --> 10:24.266
See, if I put it over here,
ah, it's gonna tip and fall,

10:24.333 --> 10:26.633
right, and if I put
the napkin holder over here--

10:26.700 --> 10:28.300
- Oh!--
- Whoa.

10:28.367 --> 10:30.133
It's gonna tip
and fall, right,

10:30.200 --> 10:31.767
but if I find
its balance point,

10:31.834 --> 10:34.100
aha, it's balanced.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.600
Yeah, right

10:35.667 --> 10:40.266
Oh, so you're saying
I'm like the napkin holder

10:40.333 --> 10:42.133
and the tray.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.633
When I can't balance,
it's because my weight

10:44.700 --> 10:47.567
is shifting
off my balance point.

10:47.633 --> 10:48.734
Mm-hmm, and all
you have to do

10:48.800 --> 10:49.767
to find your balance point

10:49.834 --> 10:50.767
is practice.

10:50.834 --> 10:53.233
I've been practicing,
Chris.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.834
OK, Telly.
I'll help you.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.433
All right.
I'm ready to try.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.734
- Yeah. Let's do it again.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.467
OK.
- OK.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.700
- Elmo's ready, too.

11:01.767 --> 11:03.300
Breathe out.

11:03.367 --> 11:04.700
- Arms up.
- Arms up.

11:04.767 --> 11:06.233
- Arms out.
- Arms out.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.233
- Legs up.
- Leg up.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.200
- Leg up.
- Whoa...

11:10.266 --> 11:11.600
- I'm wobbling.
- OK, OK.

11:11.667 --> 11:12.800
I'm wobbling.

11:12.867 --> 11:14.533
Chris: Shift your weight
the other way.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.834
I'm wobbling
the other way.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.600
OK, OK. Just shift
your weight again--

11:17.667 --> 11:19.333
little bit more.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.633
Uh! Uh...uh...
how am I doing?

11:21.700 --> 11:25.333
Chris: Uh, Telly,
you are not falling.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.166
- I'm not...
- Uh-uh.

11:27.233 --> 11:29.367
Which means--
which means I did it.

11:29.433 --> 11:32.500
I found my balance point.

11:32.567 --> 11:33.533
I shifted my weight

11:33.600 --> 11:36.066
so both sides weigh the same.

11:36.133 --> 11:39.233
I can balance! Whoa! Ohh!

11:39.300 --> 11:42.367
Oh, thanks, Chris. Thanks.
Thanks, Elmo. Thanks, Rosita.

11:42.433 --> 11:43.900
Wow. You helped me
learn to balance.

Ooh! Hey, Sherry!

16:32.934 --> 16:34.433
- Hi, Murray.
- Hi.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.066
What is yoga?

16:36.133 --> 16:38.433
Well, yoga is the coming
together of your brain

16:38.500 --> 16:40.166
and your body.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.533
Sherry: We're gonna
learn how to breathe,

16:41.600 --> 16:42.900
we're gonna learn how
to do yoga poses,

16:42.967 --> 16:44.734
we're gonna stretch
our muscles out.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.934
We make them more flexible,
and it makes us really strong.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.767
This is called tree pose.

16:49.834 --> 16:53.300
We reach our arms up,
and we balance on one foot.

16:53.367 --> 16:54.567
Murray: You're really good
at that, Ovejita.

16:54.633 --> 16:56.467
Muy bien, Ovejita.

16:56.533 --> 16:57.567
Gracias.

16:57.633 --> 16:59.033
Why do you want
to balance, Sherry?

16:59.100 --> 17:01.567
Well, it helps us
to focus and to concentrate.

17:01.633 --> 17:03.600
Murray:
What does it mean to focus?

17:03.667 --> 17:04.867
It's paying attention.

17:04.934 --> 17:06.700
What are some of the poses
you like to do?

17:06.767 --> 17:08.900
I like to do
some arm balances.

17:08.967 --> 17:11.100
How do you do
an arm balance?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.967
Murray: Whoa! That's
an awesome arm balance.

17:16.033 --> 17:17.800
Do you have favorite
poses you like to do?

17:17.867 --> 17:19.467
I like doing handstands.

17:19.533 --> 17:21.300
You can do handstands?

17:21.367 --> 17:22.333
You think you could
show me one?

17:25.367 --> 17:28.433
Murray: Whoa! That is
some great balance.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.367
Can you show me one
of these balancing exercises?

17:30.433 --> 17:32.266
Sure. I'm gonna
stand on one foot.

17:32.333 --> 17:33.467
OK.

17:33.533 --> 17:35.100
I'm gonna hold
on to my toe...

17:35.166 --> 17:36.233
- OK.
- And I'm gonna lift

17:36.300 --> 17:37.367
my leg up in the air.

17:37.433 --> 17:38.800
Ooh! I'll try it.

17:38.867 --> 17:40.500
I'm up for it.
Here I go.

17:40.567 --> 17:42.467
Gonna pull my leg up,
gonna pull it up.

17:42.533 --> 17:44.567
I'm bal--
I'm bal-- whoa!

17:44.633 --> 17:46.066
Ohh!

17:46.133 --> 17:47.500
Ugh!

17:47.567 --> 17:49.200
- I'm OK.

17:49.266 --> 17:50.533
OK. Good.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.066
I'm not really great
at balancing.

17:52.133 --> 17:53.600
That's the thing
about yoga.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.433
You don't have to be great
at it because we practice it.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.533
- It takes some time.
- It takes time.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.266
Take a big breath in.
Reach your arms to the sky.

18:00.867 --> 18:02.367
Beautiful.
As you breathe out,

18:02.433 --> 18:04.233
forward bend over your legs.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.166
Step back
into downward facing dog,

18:07.233 --> 18:08.600
Sherry: And, from here,
come into upward facing dog.

18:08.667 --> 18:09.734
Look up to the sky.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.200
Upward dog!

18:11.266 --> 18:12.367
Hee hee hee!

18:12.433 --> 18:14.667
Come all the way back
up for warrior one.

18:14.734 --> 18:16.700
Say, "I am strong!"

18:16.767 --> 18:18.300
Kids:
I am strong!

18:18.367 --> 18:20.667
Open your arms out
to a "T" for warrior two.

18:20.734 --> 18:22.133
Say, "I am bold!"

18:22.200 --> 18:24.166
I am bold!

18:24.233 --> 18:26.467
Nice. Now get ready.
Here's the tricky part.

18:26.533 --> 18:28.266
We're gonna push
off that front leg

18:28.333 --> 18:30.400
to come into warrior three.

18:30.467 --> 18:32.700
"My own balance I can hold."

18:32.767 --> 18:35.300
Kids:
My own balance I can hold!

18:35.367 --> 18:36.300
Wh-w-whoa!

18:36.367 --> 18:37.734
Oof!

18:37.800 --> 18:41.133
Ohh! This is so frustrating!

18:41.200 --> 18:45.200
OK. Focus and relax.

18:47.233 --> 18:49.767
I am strong.

18:49.834 --> 18:52.533
I am bold.

18:52.600 --> 18:56.233
My own balance I can hold.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.533
Hey, look at me.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.233
I balanced!

18:59.300 --> 19:03.500
Oh, boy. I love getting
my balance at yoga school.

19:03.567 --> 19:05.667

20:30.433 --> 20:34.600
Oh, guess what Elmo is
wondering about today.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.700
Wait for it.

20:36.767 --> 20:39.433
Wait for it!

20:39.500 --> 20:42.700
Oh, ho ho! Yoga.

20:42.767 --> 20:44.800
Oh, the two-headed monster

20:44.867 --> 20:46.266
is doing yoga.

20:46.333 --> 20:47.834
Yeah.

20:47.900 --> 20:50.500
Wow. Nice pose,
you guys--

20:50.567 --> 20:52.233
the double warrior.

20:52.300 --> 20:55.233
Ha ha! Oh, boy,
Elmo loves yoga

20:55.300 --> 20:58.166
and wants to find out
more about it.

20:58.233 --> 21:01.200
Oh, let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

21:01.266 --> 21:02.800
Let's call her together.

21:02.867 --> 21:07.667
♪ Oh, Smartie ♪

21:07.734 --> 21:09.800
- Hiya, Elmo.
- Hi, Smartie.

21:09.867 --> 21:10.800
- Guess what.

21:10.867 --> 21:12.667
I was doing yoga.

21:12.734 --> 21:15.233
Oh, Smartie does yoga?

21:15.300 --> 21:17.166
You bet.

21:17.233 --> 21:20.300
My favorite poses
are landscape pose

21:20.367 --> 21:22.467
and portrait pose.

21:22.533 --> 21:23.934
Oh, that's perfect, Smartie,

21:24.000 --> 21:27.567
because Elmo wants to learn
all about yoga today.

21:27.633 --> 21:30.533
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:30.600 --> 21:33.567
All:
We look it up.

21:33.633 --> 21:36.333
Getting to the center
of yoga.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.367
Here we go.

21:38.433 --> 21:41.667
Yoga is a kind of exercise
that comes from India.

21:41.734 --> 21:45.500
It helps people get stronger
and more flexible.

21:45.567 --> 21:48.533
It's also a way
for you to have fun

21:48.600 --> 21:52.100
with your friends and family,
and helps you focus,

21:52.166 --> 21:55.600
keep calm,
and become more confident.

21:55.667 --> 22:00.400
There are so many fun yoga poses
to try, like flamingo,

22:00.467 --> 22:03.433
frog, and lion.

22:03.500 --> 22:04.834
So, what yoga pose

22:04.900 --> 22:07.300
do you want to try
first, Elmo?

22:07.367 --> 22:11.600
Oh, Elmo wants
to try the tree pose.

22:11.667 --> 22:15.567
Wow. You're tree-rific
at yoga, Elmo.

22:15.633 --> 22:18.734
Well, got to get
back to my yoga.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.767
Namaste, Elmo.

22:20.834 --> 22:23.266
Namaste. Ha ha ha!

22:23.333 --> 22:26.567
Boy, Elmo loves doing yoga.

22:26.633 --> 22:29.967
Hey, that gives Elmo an idea.

22:30.033 --> 22:31.467
Oh, come on.

22:31.533 --> 22:33.233
Let's play a game together.

22:33.300 --> 22:35.133
Yeah. Come on. Come on.

22:39.700 --> 22:43.333
Elmo: Look. These kids
are practicing yoga,

22:43.400 --> 22:46.700
and their yoga poses
look like these animals.

22:46.767 --> 22:49.633
Which animal is this boy
posing like?

22:49.700 --> 22:51.467
Girl:
The flamingo.

22:51.533 --> 22:55.266
Yeah, a flamingo.
And how about this girl?

22:55.333 --> 22:57.600
Boy: She looks
like she's ready to jump.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.433
Kids:
The frog.

22:59.500 --> 23:03.133
Yeah, the froggy.
And how about this girl?

23:03.200 --> 23:04.767
Which animal is she posing like?

23:04.834 --> 23:06.867
The pigeon?

23:06.934 --> 23:08.734
Kids: No.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.400
How about the lion?

23:10.467 --> 23:12.133
Kids: Yeah.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.767
Girl:
She's doing the lion pose.

23:13.834 --> 23:15.800
Yay! We did it.

23:15.867 --> 23:18.433
Boy, yoga's so cool, oh,

23:18.500 --> 23:22.300
and that makes Elmo
wonder even more.

23:22.367 --> 23:24.600
Does Mr. Noodle know yoga?

23:24.667 --> 23:26.600
Oh, let's ask him. Ha ha hee!

23:26.667 --> 23:29.600
Hey, Mr. Noodle!

23:29.667 --> 23:32.033
Oh, it's Mr. Noodle's brother,

23:32.100 --> 23:33.433
Mr. Noodle.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.633
Hi, Mr. Noodle.

23:35.700 --> 23:38.033
Mr. Noodle,
Elmo was wondering,

23:38.100 --> 23:40.834
do you practice yoga?

23:40.900 --> 23:42.433
Elmo: You do?

23:42.500 --> 23:44.700
Oh, show us how you
do yoga, Mr. Noodle.

23:44.767 --> 23:47.400
Kids:
Yeah. Show us.

23:47.467 --> 23:49.300
Girl: Mr. Noodle's playing
with a yo-yo.

23:49.367 --> 23:51.100
Elmo: That looks like fun,
Mr. Noodle,

23:51.166 --> 23:52.533
but that's not
how you do yoga.

23:52.600 --> 23:56.967
Yoga is an exercise
with different poses.

23:59.166 --> 24:00.500
Boy:
He's pretending to be a model.

24:00.567 --> 24:03.533
Elmo:
Very fashionable, Mr. Noodle,

24:03.600 --> 24:06.400
but not those kind of poses.

24:06.467 --> 24:09.300
In yoga,
people do special poses

24:09.367 --> 24:11.800
and deep breathing.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.800
Kids:
Keep trying, Mr. Noodle.

24:13.867 --> 24:16.200
Boy:
You'll get it.

24:20.667 --> 24:24.066
Elmo: Yeah. That's it.
Mr. Noodle's doing yoga.

24:24.133 --> 24:26.266
Kids: Great pose.

24:26.333 --> 24:28.600
Elmo: Uh-oh. Keep balancing,
Mr. Noodle.

24:28.667 --> 24:31.533
Keep balancing. Whoa!

24:31.600 --> 24:35.333
Oh, keep practicing yoga,
Mr. Noodle.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.066
Namaste.

24:37.133 --> 24:40.767
Boy, learning new things
makes Elmo so happy,

24:40.834 --> 24:43.667
it makes him want to dance.
