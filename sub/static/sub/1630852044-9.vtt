11:39.531 --> 11:41.132

- Yeah.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.467
- She was originally
from Sweden,

11:42.534 --> 11:44.936
but she came over to L.A.
in the 1940s,

11:45.004 --> 11:47.940
<i>opened up a furniture store

Why is he selling?

They even went the extra mile

Wow.
It's like a classic Ferrari

13:47.526 --> 13:48.492
It's awesome.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.127
What did he buy it for?

13:50.195 --> 13:52.598
- 4.5 million, and he spent,

13:52.664 --> 13:56.201
like, 1 million
to restore the house.

13:56.268 --> 13:57.869
- What'd he spend on

14:14.486 --> 14:16.488
- Everything.
- Has he given you a number?

14:16.555 --> 14:19.958
- For sure he wants 6 1/2
for this house.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.427
- So it's about
2,000 a foot here.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.164
In my opinion, it's aggressive
for the neighborhood,

14:25.230 --> 14:26.997
but I get it.

14:27.066 --> 14:29.233
I get that it's turnkey,

We're not threatening.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.795
We're telling you
we're writing an offer.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.623
- The gate isn't broken, Flagg.

20:59.691 --> 21:02.826
I changed the code.
I'm mad at you.

21:02.894 --> 21:04.229
- For what?
<i>- You're supposed to</i>

21:04.296 --> 21:05.263
<i>be my friend.</i>

21:05.331 --> 21:06.564
<i>I wrote you an offer.</i>

21:06.566 --> 21:08.500
I mean, not even to respond?

21:08.566 --> 21:10.901
<i>- I'm busy. I am doing stuff.</i>
- Well, it's been a few days,

21:10.969 --> 21:12.370
and I've heard nothing from you.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.572
- Well, dear,
when I represent you,

21:14.574 --> 21:15.840
I can hold your hand
through the process.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.042
- Well, not holding my hand

21:18.109 --> 21:20.577
or responding to my texts
are two different things.

21:20.645 --> 21:22.380
- Then why didn't you call me?

21:22.447 --> 21:24.448
Sometimes I don't respond
to texts, like, for three days.

21:24.516 --> 21:26.717
- When you get me the house,
I'll give you the gate code.

21:26.785 --> 21:27.919
<i>- Oh--</i>

21:31.324 --> 21:34.358
- I'm mad at you!
- What is your problem?

21:34.360 --> 21:38.396
- My problem is, if you can't
even respond to your friend

21:38.463 --> 21:40.998
regarding an offer
that she presented you

21:41.000 --> 21:42.933
when you know
this was important to me,

21:43.001 --> 21:45.070
and then I drive by the house,

21:45.136 --> 21:47.538
and you're, like, showing it
to someone else, that bugs me.

21:47.605 --> 21:49.707
So therefore,
I changed the gate code.

21:50.742 --> 21:53.343
Son of a bitch. Huh.

21:53.345 --> 21:55.846

21:55.914 --> 21:57.848

21:57.916 --> 22:00.551
- I'm certainly not gonna cut
all showings off for you.

22:00.619 --> 22:02.487
I don't represent you.
I represent them.

22:02.554 --> 22:04.688
- I'm not saying you have
to represent me.

22:04.756 --> 22:07.958
I'm simply saying respond
when you have an offer.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.693
- Sometimes I don't check
all my texts.

22:09.761 --> 22:11.329
Just call me, and be like,
"Hey, I texted you.

22:11.397 --> 22:12.830
Could you respond?"

22:12.898 --> 22:14.765
- If you were trying to make
a deal for me,

22:14.833 --> 22:16.567
why am I driving by the house,

22:16.635 --> 22:17.968
and you're showing it
to somebody else?

22:18.036 --> 22:19.537
- Because you don't own it yet,

22:19.604 --> 22:21.339
and I don't know
if you're gonna own it.

22:21.406 --> 22:22.774
Right now, I'm trying
to get them to take your offer

22:22.841 --> 22:24.542
and make something happen.

22:24.609 --> 22:26.444
If I have something
to tell you, I'll call you.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.545

wasn't what they wanted,</i>

22:28.613 --> 22:30.315

blow me off.

Well, if you're gonna be
a prick about it

22:35.955 --> 22:37.656
and not respond to my texts,

22:37.722 --> 22:39.658
then I'm gonna change
my gate code.

25:43.775 --> 25:45.176

25:45.243 --> 25:47.111
- Yeah it's nice.
The kids love it.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.614
I know they want
to be here more.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.850
- Especially now that they have
five grandchildren,

25:51.916 --> 25:53.051
between Matt and us.

25:53.117 --> 25:54.252
- I know.

25:54.319 --> 25:55.986
- You know?

25:56.054 --> 25:58.121
- Just hard going between
the two houses,

25:58.189 --> 25:59.790
and who do they stay with?

25:59.857 --> 26:01.725
And they don't like
being in the suitcase

26:01.793 --> 26:03.927
all the time, and it's like--
- No. I know.

26:03.929 --> 26:05.763
- Unfortunately, we don't have
extra guest rooms here,

26:05.830 --> 26:08.666
and my mom's already
in the guest house. But maybe--

26:08.733 --> 26:10.934
- I don't know.
Like, I had this crazy idea.

26:11.002 --> 26:12.736
I went on a listing appointment
the other day,

26:12.738 --> 26:16.740
and honestly, one of the
coolest houses I've ever seen.

26:16.808 --> 26:20.011
So much about it was
just so unique. Restored. Mid--

26:20.078 --> 26:22.680
- I don't want to move again.
- No, no. Not for us.

26:22.747 --> 26:27.218
Not for us. Is it crazy...
if we bought them a home

26:27.285 --> 26:29.888
and gave them a reason
to be here?

26:29.954 --> 26:32.824
Be around the grandchildren.

26:32.890 --> 26:35.425
- That's pretty significant.

26:35.427 --> 26:39.396
- It's this mint midcentury
modern built in 1948.

26:39.464 --> 26:43.867
It's been completely restored,
and it was magical.

26:43.869 --> 26:45.904
My parents have
a real appreciation

26:45.970 --> 26:47.906
for art and architecture.
Clearly.

26:47.972 --> 26:50.173

to two real estate agents.</i>

26:50.241 --> 26:53.912
<i>So they would appreciate
the time and energy and love</i>

26:53.978 --> 26:55.813
and money
that went into this house

26:55.880 --> 26:58.181
a lot more than most people,
including myself.

26:58.249 --> 27:00.318
Matt and I.
We do it together--

27:00.385 --> 27:02.185
- Where is this house?
- Right here, in Beverly Hills.

27:02.253 --> 27:03.854
It's actually five minutes
from our house.

27:03.921 --> 27:05.256
Five minutes from Matt.

27:05.323 --> 27:07.057

36:11.001 --> 36:12.470
Ha ha ho!

36:12.536 --> 36:17.340
♪ ♪

36:17.408 --> 36:19.275
Hold on!

36:19.343 --> 36:22.379
Let's go!
We've got the (BLEEP) house!

36:22.446 --> 36:24.013
- Hey!
- Hey!

36:24.015 --> 36:26.484
- Guys.
- Amazing.

36:26.550 --> 36:28.751
- Let's go. Let's go.

36:28.819 --> 36:30.221
- Get it.
- All right.

36:30.287 --> 36:31.754
- Congratulations.
- This is amazing.

36:31.822 --> 36:33.556
- Can I just tell you something?

36:33.624 --> 36:35.892
When it's with people
that are just good people,

36:35.894 --> 36:37.494
and then you get that house...

36:37.496 --> 36:39.362
- Yeah.
- This is why I do what I do.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.264
It's the best job
in the world. I mean that.

36:43.367 --> 36:44.368
- Yeah!
- Champagne!

36:44.435 --> 36:46.035
- Let's go.
- Champagne.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.637
- Hey!

36:50.308 --> 36:52.041
<i>- Coming up...
- You're very impatient,</i>

36:52.043 --> 36:54.243
so I'm just going to call
the business manager.

36:54.245 --> 36:57.847
- Like, not a dollar more.
- It's a house in the Flats.

36:57.915 --> 37:00.483
What do you want? You both have
drawn a line in the sand.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.736
- Excuse me, Mr. Flagg.
- Hold on one second. Hi.

37:19.804 --> 37:22.672
- The lady is waiting for you
in the living room.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.741
- Ms. Tutor? Okay.
- Yes.

37:24.743 --> 37:27.410
- Tracy just got here.
Talk to you later. Bye-bye.

37:28.446 --> 37:30.880
- I finally got my counter
on the property on Hillcrest,

37:30.948 --> 37:33.750
and since I am not allowed at
Tracy's house, at the moment,

37:33.818 --> 37:36.453
<i>I have invited her
to my house this morning,</i>

37:36.520 --> 37:39.022
to discuss a counter offer,
which I have in hand.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.958
So we're talking now?
- I suppose so, since you have

37:41.025 --> 37:42.625
a counter offer for me.

37:42.693 --> 37:44.761
- Oh, so you're just using me.
- For what?

37:44.763 --> 37:46.562
The house you're trying to sell?

37:46.630 --> 37:48.898
- I don't understand.
You're being a total bitch.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.235
- I wouldn't say that
I'm being a total bitch.

37:51.302 --> 37:53.703
I would say that, as my friend,

37:53.771 --> 37:56.973
to ignore me
for several days on end

37:57.041 --> 37:58.908
when I've presented you an offer

37:58.976 --> 38:00.910
was just, like, sh---y.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.645
- It's not intentional.
I apologize.

38:02.647 --> 38:04.547
I've had a lot of stuff
on my plate, and I'm doing

38:04.549 --> 38:06.850
what's important, which is
trying to work the deal.

38:06.917 --> 38:09.786
- Well, I appreciate that.
- I have a counter for you.

38:09.854 --> 38:11.454
8.5 million.

38:11.522 --> 38:13.990
- Hmm.
- They are in Europe.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.725
This is not their top priority.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.795
I assure you
I'm calling them all the time.

38:17.861 --> 38:21.731
There's time differences.
They paid 8,450 for this house.

38:21.733 --> 38:26.069
They're asking 8.675.
8.5 is a very good counter.

38:26.136 --> 38:27.804
- I appreciate the counter.

38:27.872 --> 38:29.806
I understand
where your clients are.

38:29.874 --> 38:33.277
I'm just going to give you my
best and final, and that's 8.2.

38:33.344 --> 38:35.412
With all of the work that
I have to do to that house,

38:35.479 --> 38:37.146
to make it right,

38:37.214 --> 38:39.482
it's the reason it hasn't sold,
in the first place.

38:39.484 --> 38:43.486
So to be at 8.675 and me
be able to close this deal

38:43.554 --> 38:47.623
in 30 days all cash, at 8.2,
I think they should take it.

38:47.691 --> 38:49.293
<i>I'm beyond my limit.</i>

38:49.360 --> 38:51.094
I mean, at some point,
I have to be

38:51.161 --> 38:52.896
my financial advocate

38:52.963 --> 38:56.400
and make sure that I am
making smart financial choices,

38:56.466 --> 38:58.835
because this is
my girls' future.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.971
- I'm going to go outside,
and I'm going to make a call.

39:02.039 --> 39:03.106
- Are you even gonna be able
to reach them?

39:03.173 --> 39:04.707
Aren't they in Europe?

39:04.709 --> 39:06.042
- No. I will not be able
to reach them.

39:06.044 --> 39:08.044
I have to call
the business manager.

39:08.046 --> 39:11.647
- So you're gonna
negotiate in a robe?

39:11.715 --> 39:13.450
- Yeah.

39:13.517 --> 39:16.553
Bob Evans always worked out
of his robe. Why can't I?

39:16.620 --> 39:18.555
I'm gonna do what I need to do,
to get you the house, okay?

39:18.622 --> 39:20.857
- Okay.
Careful with the breeze,

39:20.924 --> 39:22.859
in that robe.
- Okay.

39:22.926 --> 39:25.863
<i>We're not talking about a
huge jump here with $300,000.</i>

39:25.929 --> 39:28.497
Like, I feel like we can
make a deal in here somehow.

39:28.566 --> 39:31.534
<i>With that said,
to play the devil's advocate,</i>

39:31.536 --> 39:33.002
<i>the lot on this
is worth 8 million.</i>

39:33.070 --> 39:34.672
<i>She's essentially paying
for the structure.</i>

39:34.738 --> 39:38.508
Now, you tell me,
is that not a good deal?

39:38.576 --> 39:41.010
- Paul, it's Josh Flagg.
How are you?

39:41.078 --> 39:42.813
- Good.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.480
- No. Not quite yet.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.950
I spoke to Mrs. Tutor,
and she said

39:47.017 --> 39:51.088
that her highest and best
that she can go is 8.2,

39:51.155 --> 39:53.489
and I think she's a good
candidate for this house.

39:53.557 --> 39:55.625
There's not a lot of people
that this house works for.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.927
You know, it only is essentially

39:57.995 --> 39:59.462
a three-bedroom house.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.097
With that said,
what can we do here?

40:01.165 --> 40:02.665
I'd love to get her
into this house.

40:02.667 --> 40:04.000
I really would.

40:07.571 --> 40:09.106
- I want to get you
as much money as possible,

40:09.173 --> 40:13.510
but the reality is no one's
banging down the door.

40:17.181 --> 40:18.849
- That's it? There's not
a penny under that?

40:18.916 --> 40:21.518
Like, is this worth us waiting,
you know, 12 hours

40:21.585 --> 40:23.053
and calling Europe? I mean--

40:26.890 --> 40:28.691
- All right. Thanks.

40:28.693 --> 40:30.427
- Bye.

40:30.494 --> 40:31.994
<i>At the end of the day,
my clients are my</i>

40:32.062 --> 40:34.730
#1 priority, not Tracy.
I don't represent her.

40:34.798 --> 40:36.099
<i>Yes, Tracy is my friend,</i>

40:36.166 --> 40:37.667
<i>and let's say there was
multiple offers.</i>

40:37.669 --> 40:39.068
Of course I would push for hers,

40:39.070 --> 40:41.537
<i>but that's not happening
right now.</i>

40:41.605 --> 40:44.707
They've come down to 8.4.

40:44.709 --> 40:47.210
- I can't get there. I--
- It's a house in the Flats.

40:47.277 --> 40:48.711
What do you want?

40:48.713 --> 40:52.148
- I genuinely, Josh, cannot go--

40:52.150 --> 40:55.084
Not a dollar above 8.2.

40:55.152 --> 40:56.887
- You know, I should be
sitting here

40:56.954 --> 40:58.821
forcing you to buy this house
and telling you why,

40:58.889 --> 41:00.223
but I mean the reality is
I don't want you

41:00.290 --> 41:01.891
to pay
outside of your comfort zone.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.427
I wish there was something
I could do.

41:03.494 --> 41:04.961
It's $200,000. There's no--

41:04.963 --> 41:06.896
- I know. I know.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.965
- And I would say,
"Can't you come up 100?

41:08.967 --> 41:10.534
Maybe they come down 100,"

41:10.600 --> 41:12.301
but you both have
drawn a line in the sand.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.971
- Yeah. The kids just had
their hearts set on it,

41:15.038 --> 41:16.839
a little bit, and it's like

41:16.841 --> 41:21.177
I was willing to push
the envelope, but I get it.

41:21.245 --> 41:25.181
I really thought it was
the one, you know? This sucks.

41:25.249 --> 41:29.118
<i>I feel like--this is how I
felt for so many of my buyers.</i>

41:29.186 --> 41:31.455
Just that, like,
punch in the gut

41:31.522 --> 41:34.257
where you know that this is it.

41:34.324 --> 41:37.927
I love you for trying,
and I'll call you sort of

41:37.995 --> 41:40.163
when I wrap my head
around all of it.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.064
<i>We'll just have to keep looking,</i>

41:42.132 --> 41:44.734
<i>and you know, give myself
and my girls the same advice</i>

41:44.736 --> 41:46.135
<i>that I give other buyers.</i>

41:46.203 --> 41:49.806
Sometimes,
it's just not meant to be.

42:00.585 --> 42:03.019
- Interest rates are
at an all-time low,

42:03.021 --> 42:05.021
<i>so what you thought
you could afford</i>

42:05.088 --> 42:07.089
<i>a year-and-a-half
or two years ago</i>

42:07.157 --> 42:08.958
<i>you now can afford much,
much more,</i>

42:09.026 --> 42:11.093
and your payment
doesn't even change.

42:11.161 --> 42:14.097
Hi. What are you doing here?

42:14.099 --> 42:17.033
- I found a house for you.
- Shut up.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.167
- I found the perfect house
for you.

42:18.235 --> 42:21.671
- What?
- It's Hillcrest.

42:23.373 --> 42:24.807
- What?

42:24.809 --> 42:25.909
- I got you
the deal on Hillcrest.

42:25.976 --> 42:27.710
- How?

42:27.778 --> 42:30.246
- I didn't take a commission,
and it's your house now.

42:30.314 --> 42:34.050
- What? Are you serious?

42:34.118 --> 42:35.718
Really?
- Yeah.

42:35.786 --> 42:37.119
- These are the keys?

42:37.187 --> 42:38.555
- Well, you have to, like,
close escrow

42:38.623 --> 42:39.923
and give them money, but--

42:39.990 --> 42:41.658
- You gave up your commission
for me?

42:41.725 --> 42:45.595
- Yeah. Congratulations.

42:45.662 --> 42:47.130
- I love you.

42:50.801 --> 42:52.201
<i>- Still to come this season,</i>

42:52.203 --> 42:54.104
<i>on "Million Dollar
Listing L.A."...</i>

42:56.874 --> 42:58.307
- Ahh!
- What?

42:58.375 --> 43:00.310
- Wow.
- It looks so good, right?

43:00.377 --> 43:02.212
- This is ridiculous.
- Wow.

43:02.279 --> 43:03.714
- So this is the legends court.

43:03.780 --> 43:07.049
- What?
- Oh, the court of dreams.

43:07.051 --> 43:08.851
- I don't really call her
a home.

43:08.853 --> 43:12.388
She's really more of
a golden age Hollywood museum.

43:12.456 --> 43:14.223
- She's a museum, all right.

43:14.225 --> 43:16.226
- It looks like it's got
a nice back garden.

43:16.293 --> 43:18.361
- Okay, dear.
That's--oh, my God.

43:18.428 --> 43:19.830
She's definitely
breaking and entering.

43:19.896 --> 43:22.231
- Here we go. Sell the house.

43:22.299 --> 43:24.967
- Lev and Elena were on
"Dancing With the Stars."

43:25.035 --> 43:26.236
- Yeah.
- Both: Whoo!

43:26.303 --> 43:27.904
- Wow.

43:27.971 --> 43:31.374
- I feel like 2,995
we're at 2,600 a foot.

43:31.441 --> 43:33.943
- Is that a float tank?
- It's hot, I--what is that?

43:34.011 --> 43:35.311
- Yes. You can float in it.

43:35.379 --> 43:38.981
- They actually came up to 24.5
- 28.5.

43:38.983 --> 43:42.351
- Excuse me?
- 28.5. Non-negotiable.

43:42.419 --> 43:43.953
- Hello, Suzanne Somers
and Alan Hamel.

43:44.021 --> 43:46.055
<i>- We have a bit of a situation.</i>

43:46.123 --> 43:47.790
- So are you calling to fire me?

43:47.792 --> 43:49.725
<i>- Well, um...</i>

43:49.727 --> 43:51.794
- You're trying to make me
look bad, 'cause you're mean.

43:51.862 --> 43:54.263
- You think I authentically
----ing feel this way

43:54.265 --> 43:55.831
because I want
to "make you look bad"?

43:55.899 --> 43:57.266
- Yeah. I do.

43:57.268 --> 43:59.569
- Well, then
you're a fake ----ing ass----!

44:01.038 --> 44:05.007
- I want to welcome all of you
to the legendary Cedars.

44:05.009 --> 44:08.144
- This is a trip.
- Do I look overtly gay?

44:08.212 --> 44:09.646
- Yes, Flagg.

44:09.648 --> 44:11.480
- I actually came here
to support you.

44:11.548 --> 44:13.816
- You, from the very beginning,
did not like that I came here,

44:13.884 --> 44:15.418
and you are attacking me...
- No.

44:15.420 --> 44:18.087
- Over, and over, and over.
- You know what?

44:18.089 --> 44:21.291
Our relationship.
The last string. It's cut.
