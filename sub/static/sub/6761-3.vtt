01:35.061 --> 01:37.856
Listen, Mom, I hear what you're saying,

01:38.106 --> 01:40.525
but it'll give me a chance
to spend some time with nature

01:40.608 --> 01:42.402
and get out of those
smog-infested malls

01:42.485 --> 01:44.570
that you're always ranting about.

01:44.654 --> 01:49.409
Yes, correctly so. Of course, Mother,
the air here isn't really air.

01:50.201 --> 01:51.619
But what could be healthier

01:51.703 --> 01:55.206
than spending Friday night riding horses
through Topanga Canyon?

01:55.289 --> 01:58.042
And riding is such super exercise.

01:58.501 --> 02:01.671
Yeah, I know I've never really been
riding before,

02:01.754 --> 02:04.465
but you're always saying how girls
should be more adventurous.

02:04.549 --> 02:05.716
So, Mom...

02:05.800 --> 02:08.051
Whoa, whoa. Bren, Bren.

02:08.344 --> 02:11.180
You're trotting down
the wrong path here.

02:11.264 --> 02:13.140
You gotta hit Mom
where her soft-spot is.

02:13.224 --> 02:16.185
You know, milk that Mother Nature stuff.

02:17.728 --> 02:19.730
"Mom. Mommy.

02:20.231 --> 02:23.234
"Remember when we used to hike
in the woods around Gull Lake

02:23.317 --> 02:24.819
"when we were kids?

02:24.902 --> 02:27.363
"I miss those times so much,

02:27.446 --> 02:29.782
"and now I can recapture them."

02:29.949 --> 02:30.992
Perfect.

02:31.075 --> 02:34.578
Just make it seem natural, all right?
Not like we rehearsed it or anything.

02:34.662 --> 02:35.955
I won't.

02:39.166 --> 02:41.001
Talk about that, talk about anything,

02:41.085 --> 02:44.046
but whatever you do,
do not talk about money.

02:45.673 --> 02:50.511
Sorry, honey, but $120 is too much
to spend on a twilight horseback ride.

02:50.928 --> 02:52.137
Water.

02:52.930 --> 02:56.392
You know, I'm not anybody here.
I have no clothes.

02:56.600 --> 02:59.937
Seems to me what you're wearing
passes the clothing definition test.

03:01.563 --> 03:03.524
Honey, you know,
just because we live here

03:03.607 --> 03:05.651
doesn't mean we take our cues
from these people.

03:05.734 --> 03:07.611
I mean, we're not their clones.

03:07.695 --> 03:11.323
Relax, Mother. I don't think
you have any worries in that area.

03:11.407 --> 03:13.867
You're a unique fashion statement here.

03:13.951 --> 03:17.162
Yeah, Mrs Green Jeans moves
to Beverly Hills.

03:17.913 --> 03:19.498
Come on, Bren, we gotta jet.

03:19.581 --> 03:22.209
Typical. He oversleeps
and then he rushes me.

03:22.292 --> 03:24.837
You know, honey, if people only like you
for your appearance,

03:24.920 --> 03:26.672
they don't really like you.

03:26.755 --> 03:29.049
Don't dig too deep here, Mom.

03:42.688 --> 03:45.565
I'm sorry. I don't speak Spanish.

03:55.867 --> 04:00.580
I'm sorry, but someone must have
given you the wrong address. Okay?

04:00.747 --> 04:02.833
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:39.077 --> 04:40.453
Your hat is so dope. Where?

04:40.537 --> 04:42.580
Where do you think? Here.

04:44.707 --> 04:46.584
Well, it looks better on me.

04:47.919 --> 04:51.464
- Last night I saw you in a Beemer.
- Yeah, well, my father bought it for me.

04:51.547 --> 04:53.591
- Is it a convertible?
- Of course it is.

04:53.675 --> 04:55.635
Can you conceive a top on me?

04:57.553 --> 04:59.639
I didn't know she and Kelly
were such good friends.

04:59.722 --> 05:02.725
Ex-such good friends.
From grade school.

05:06.020 --> 05:09.524
I don't know what to do, Jim.
She's already cleaning.

05:09.857 --> 05:12.235
Wait a minute. You mean
there's a stranger in our home?

05:12.318 --> 05:14.737
<i>Take me off the damn speakerphone.</i>

05:17.073 --> 05:19.158
Oh, hey, I know who she is.

05:19.242 --> 05:22.995
Alan's wife mentioned her cleaning lady
having a cousin who needed work.

05:23.079 --> 05:25.706
Thank you for including me
in on the decision.

05:25.790 --> 05:26.916
It completely slipped my mind.

05:26.999 --> 05:29.418
Well, it's interesting
what one chooses to forget.

05:30.378 --> 05:32.505
Honey, I thought you'd like it.

05:32.588 --> 05:34.340
<i>Everyone in Beverly Hills has a maid.</i>

05:34.423 --> 05:37.134
<i>- Now you sound like Brenda.
- So? Come on.</i>

05:37.259 --> 05:39.470
We had someone clean the house
back in Minneapolis.

05:39.553 --> 05:41.597
Well, but that was
only for a few hours a week,

05:41.680 --> 05:43.391
and that was when I worked
at Mom's store.

05:43.474 --> 05:46.852
I mean, that was when I had a life
and friends and a world and...

05:46.936 --> 05:49.021
And a phone
that didn't cut everybody off.

05:49.105 --> 05:50.773
Jim! Jim!

05:58.197 --> 05:59.240
Hi.

06:06.246 --> 06:07.873
<i>Les Miserables.</i>

06:08.624 --> 06:10.376
Sounds kind of miserable, doesn't it?

06:12.252 --> 06:14.963
You've all seen
or you've heard about the play.

06:15.047 --> 06:17.091
Now I want you to read the book.

06:17.174 --> 06:19.593
It's got sex.

06:19.885 --> 06:21.512
It's got crime.

06:21.887 --> 06:26.225
One minuscule crime ruined
Jean Valjean's life.

06:26.683 --> 06:30.395
What sentence would you give someone

06:31.104 --> 06:35.317
for stealing bread to feed
his widowed sister and starving family?

06:37.569 --> 06:38.820
Brenda.

06:40.113 --> 06:43.742
I think he should've gotten
a light sentence. Definitely, for sure.

06:43.825 --> 06:47.537
Wrong. At least
according to Hugo's judges.

06:47.704 --> 06:49.790
He got 20 years.

06:50.332 --> 06:51.416
That's true.

06:51.500 --> 06:56.254
He tried to escape.
But wouldn't you, from hard cells,

06:56.338 --> 07:00.509
hardened criminals, rats, roaches?

07:05.555 --> 07:09.100
Hugo would be amused to find
that you consider his work a comedy.

07:11.520 --> 07:14.522
Tell me, what do you think
of Jean Valjean's crime?

07:16.066 --> 07:18.401
I say let them eat cake.

07:20.070 --> 07:23.782
Our own little local Marie Antoinette
raises a good point.

07:24.032 --> 07:27.535
You see, it's very hard for us
in the golden ghetto

07:27.619 --> 07:30.914
to understand that kind of need.

07:33.041 --> 07:35.543
Okay. Papers due on Monday.

07:35.960 --> 07:39.130
Remember, I want you to explore how

07:40.048 --> 07:42.842
one decision, one event,

07:42.926 --> 07:45.261
can change one's whole life.

07:47.180 --> 07:48.973
So whose Beemer should we take?

07:49.057 --> 07:52.227
Hey, Tiff!
That was really funny, what you said.

07:52.352 --> 07:54.270
Who was trying to be funny?

07:54.729 --> 07:56.397
Hey, wait up, you guys.

07:58.024 --> 08:00.068
<i>Male, female, root our school.</i>

08:00.151 --> 08:03.196
<i>West Beverly team
against Beverly High, don't fail!</i>

08:03.279 --> 08:06.574
<i>And don't get lured
by that sweet, sweet nitro sale.</i>

08:06.657 --> 08:08.201
<i>Sale. Sale, sale.</i>

08:08.284 --> 08:10.286
Sale? Are you there?

08:10.495 --> 08:11.871
Sure. Why not?

08:11.996 --> 08:13.414
Spend hard.

08:17.251 --> 08:18.795
You wanna come?

08:19.587 --> 08:21.881
- Here.
- I can't really buy.

08:21.964 --> 08:24.717
My American Express,
I left home without it.

08:25.218 --> 08:27.011
No money. Just fun.

08:27.970 --> 08:29.180
- Okay.
- Okay?

08:29.263 --> 08:30.431
Here.

08:35.436 --> 08:37.313
I'll see you in class, okay?

08:41.232 --> 08:42.943
You're job hunting?

08:43.027 --> 08:45.363
How un-Beverly Hills.

08:46.197 --> 08:47.656
Is that good or bad?

08:47.740 --> 08:50.034
From me? Good, I guess.

08:50.910 --> 08:53.788
I'm just doing my bit for car insurance,
you know.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.665
Any hot leads?

08:57.249 --> 08:59.877
Oh, I got Garden Graphics,

08:59.960 --> 09:03.672
Veggie Heaven Produce,
This Town Restaurant.

09:04.131 --> 09:07.468
- We're talking slam dunk here.
- Yeah. Well, good luck, eh?

09:07.551 --> 09:08.802
Thanks.

10:11.865 --> 10:14.367
Well, you don't have much experience.

10:15.035 --> 10:16.494
I understand.

10:16.953 --> 10:19.206
You don't have to explain.
It's okay, really.

10:19.289 --> 10:22.167
Hey, babe,
I know my restauranteur rights.

10:22.250 --> 10:23.793
When can you start?

10:23.877 --> 10:25.712
I'm sorry I took up your time.

10:25.795 --> 10:28.006
Didn't you hear me? I said yes.

10:29.174 --> 10:30.634
You said yes?

10:30.717 --> 10:32.927
Yes, I said yes!

10:33.261 --> 10:34.387
Don't make me rethink it.

10:34.471 --> 10:38.600
No, no, don't! Don't rethink it.
Don't... Don't think about anything.

10:39.976 --> 10:41.519
Overkill, hon.

10:49.068 --> 10:50.945
"Inverted nipple trouble."

10:51.404 --> 10:52.614
Pass.

10:53.198 --> 10:56.075
"Are you always attracted to losers?

10:56.659 --> 10:58.995
"Here's how to break the cycle."

10:59.203 --> 11:00.788
Here is the cycle.

11:01.289 --> 11:04.334
Trust me, dude. They'll drool over this.

11:04.626 --> 11:06.628
- Are you sure, Steve?
- Yeah.

11:06.794 --> 11:10.548
Oh, finally found somebody your own
maturity level to hang with, Steve?

11:10.882 --> 11:13.342
Oh, hey, Tiff. How is that waterbed?

11:13.426 --> 11:15.970
Kelly and Tiffany got nuclear over Steve.

11:16.054 --> 11:17.263
Details, please.

11:17.346 --> 11:18.890
But it was intense fallout.

11:18.973 --> 11:22.310
They just started speaking
this semester in English class.

11:26.439 --> 11:29.150
- Tiff has always been so subtle.
- Yeah.

11:30.443 --> 11:32.987
This is death. 100% silk.

11:33.070 --> 11:35.281
Bren, you have to have it. Come on.

11:41.495 --> 11:44.332
Kelly, do you really think one event
can change your whole life?

11:44.415 --> 11:46.083
<i>Sure, like in Pretty Woman?</i>

11:46.167 --> 11:47.209
Sorry, Julia Roberts,

11:47.293 --> 11:50.504
but I would have worn this
on the plane with Richard Gere.

11:50.588 --> 11:53.340
No, I mean
like what Miss Rye was talking about.

11:53.424 --> 11:56.093
One thing you do ruining your entire life.

11:56.177 --> 11:59.263
- I don't know. Forget it.
- Maybe it wasn't ruined.

11:59.346 --> 12:01.599
Maybe he wanted it that way.

12:03.142 --> 12:05.895
<i>One decision, one event,</i>

12:05.978 --> 12:08.230
<i>can change one's whole life.</i>

12:30.335 --> 12:31.712
Let's get out of here, okay?

12:31.795 --> 12:33.464
<i>Yeah. Cool with moi.</i>

12:33.547 --> 12:36.216
I'm just gonna get these five things.
Do you like them?

12:36.300 --> 12:37.926
Yeah, I like them.

12:38.760 --> 12:41.472
Hey, wait up.
I'm not buying anything, either.

13:04.286 --> 13:07.497
She's back.
What do you mean, who? Anna.

13:07.789 --> 13:11.251
Honey, I'm in overdrive here.
I've got 10K's flying.

13:11.334 --> 13:13.545
<i>- Can't you deal with it?
- Can't I deal with it?</i>

13:13.628 --> 13:16.047
<i>Yes, I can deal with it.
I told her not to come.</i>

13:17.132 --> 13:18.466
Oh, Jim!

13:19.426 --> 13:21.136
Ma Bell, where are you?

13:38.403 --> 13:39.946
Great for a grandma.

13:46.202 --> 13:47.579
Oh, pathetic.

14:10.476 --> 14:13.146
This Town? That is the nitro restaurant.

14:13.229 --> 14:14.605
And I'm a nitro guy.

14:14.689 --> 14:17.567
Oh, dude, you scored a sweet job.
If you're into jobs.

14:17.650 --> 14:21.029
What, This Town? Yeah, it's all right.
I ate there opening night.

14:21.112 --> 14:22.363
Delicious cumin.

14:22.447 --> 14:23.781
Delicious tips, I hope.

14:23.865 --> 14:25.366
They hired you as a waiter?

14:25.450 --> 14:28.161
I guess. I don't know.
She said she was going on instinct.

14:28.244 --> 14:31.497
Instincts, I'll bet. Of the "get busy" kind?

14:31.581 --> 14:33.624
Hey, come on, I'm a waiter, not a lover.

14:39.672 --> 14:42.091
Do you remember
Jake kissed like a wall?

14:42.174 --> 14:43.259
Oh, my God, yeah.

14:43.342 --> 14:45.886
But he was better than The Lizard.
Remember?

14:45.970 --> 14:47.179
Oh, that's gross.

14:47.263 --> 14:49.640
- Hey.
- Hey. Cool dress.

14:49.724 --> 14:52.018
Yeah, it's a kick for sure.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.605
How nice of you to model for us.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.691
- Miss Rye?
- Yeah.

15:00.401 --> 15:02.528
I was just wondering who's more guilty,

15:02.611 --> 15:06.031
<i>someone like in Les Mis
who didn't want to steal, but had to?</i>

15:06.115 --> 15:08.534
Or someone who wanted to, but didn't?

15:09.285 --> 15:11.370
That's an interesting moral twister.

15:11.662 --> 15:14.290
And we'll get to that. Now.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.379
Coffee?

15:30.764 --> 15:32.850
I hope it's not too strong.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.478
<i>Oh, no. Gracias, miss.</i>

15:36.562 --> 15:39.022
- Oh, call me Cindy.
- Okay.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.531
And here are our female mounties.

15:47.865 --> 15:49.992
<i>- What do you have to say, girls?
- Nothing.</i>

15:50.075 --> 15:51.451
<i>Okay.</i>

15:54.997 --> 15:57.374
<i>Who's hiding behind that video camera?</i>

15:58.292 --> 15:59.835
David Silver.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.712
Well, David Silver,

16:01.920 --> 16:05.966
<i>my name is Tiffany Morgan,
and I know what you really wanna see.</i>

16:07.718 --> 16:09.970
Oh, my God. Hurt me.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.848
- What a show.
- Yeah, sometimes.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.059
Some of her reruns aren't
so dope, though.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.770
Why were you guys ex-friends?

16:19.187 --> 16:22.149
She was just too wild,
kind of a troublemaker, before.

16:22.232 --> 16:25.068
Giddyup. We're gonna lose out
on the best in the west.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.696
Sorry you can't come, Bren. Tiff, you in?

16:27.904 --> 16:30.115
No, I gotta exchange some stuff.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.703
Besides, four-legged creatures
don't interest me.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.496
Yeah, me neither.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.499
- You wanna go hang at Nitro?
- Yeah.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.377
- I mean, sure, okay, if you want.
- Great.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.130
We'll stop by your place on the way.

16:47.340 --> 16:51.845
<i>It's loco, but I can't seem to watch
somebody working without helping.</i>

16:52.011 --> 16:53.596
<i>You comprende?</i>

16:54.389 --> 16:56.558
I'm not a lady of leisure.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.727
That's why I'm uncomfortable
having you here.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.398
I mean, not you. Just the idea of you.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.194
Jim likes the image of you.

17:09.904 --> 17:14.409
You know, I have to say, image is
very important to my daughter, also.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.743
Well, at her age...

17:20.373 --> 17:22.458
- Hey.
- Oh, hi, honey.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.920
- That's my mom.
- Which one?

17:29.257 --> 17:30.967
We're going upstairs.

17:34.679 --> 17:37.140
Are you sure you don't want a snack?

17:38.891 --> 17:42.728
You'll never see my mom
with a cleaning utensil in her hand.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.690
You'll never see my mom at all.

17:53.906 --> 17:54.949
Oh!

17:55.324 --> 17:57.535
This is cozy.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.496
I just had my room redone.

18:00.663 --> 18:03.666
- I'm in my black period.
- Cool.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.585
<i>Les Miserables, what a kick.</i>

18:06.669 --> 18:11.340
Oh, yeah, they make the CliffsNotes so
long, you might as well read the book.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.761
I'd never steal.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.013
Would you?

18:21.976 --> 18:23.727
I don't think so.

18:26.313 --> 18:29.108
So, is it all right
if I just stash some stuff here?

18:29.191 --> 18:32.069
- I don't feel like lugging it around.
- Sure.

18:52.005 --> 18:53.549
What's wrong?

18:54.174 --> 18:56.218
You're 15 minutes early.

18:57.135 --> 19:01.682
Yeah, well, I didn't wanna be late
or get stuck in Friday traffic hell.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.559
I can handle that.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.395
Let's get busy.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.816
But there are no customers yet.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.818
Let me see your hands.

19:13.026 --> 19:16.113
Perfect. We've gotta get them
into tight places.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.281
Listen, I'm supposed to be a waiter.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.784
Oh, darling,
you're not waiter material yet.

19:20.867 --> 19:23.495
You're gonna work in the back
with Yuri and Chang.

19:23.578 --> 19:25.330
I think I'll start you on cumin.

19:25.413 --> 19:28.792
See if you can get those big hands
into that little jar.

19:32.295 --> 19:34.506
Well, I gotta start somewhere.

19:35.840 --> 19:40.303
Only Catherine the Great would
pick a horse over shopping.

19:41.096 --> 19:43.348
So, you and Kelly were best friends?

19:44.474 --> 19:46.017
Yeah, for two years.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.895
Then she got super-possessive
and boring.

19:49.729 --> 19:52.524
I had a best friend in Minneapolis
since 5th grade.

19:52.607 --> 19:55.110
We used to go over
to each other's houses every weekend

19:55.193 --> 19:56.528
and spend the night.

19:58.321 --> 20:00.824
You're really from the real world.

20:03.618 --> 20:05.870
We were just here yesterday.

20:05.954 --> 20:07.789
Well, that's the fun.

20:07.872 --> 20:09.332
Going back.

20:13.753 --> 20:15.880
- Brandon, table four.
- All right.

20:16.881 --> 20:18.466
Brandon, I need you first.

20:18.549 --> 20:21.678
My new crumber.
Ain't he a piece of work?

20:25.765 --> 20:28.226
- This job's a bitch.
- No kidding, man.

20:28.309 --> 20:31.396
She canned and pickled Julio
right before you rode in.

20:31.479 --> 20:32.814
Now I know why she hired me.

20:32.897 --> 20:36.275
She hires, she fires, a la carte.
No benefits.

20:36.567 --> 20:38.736
So, what's our share of the tips?

20:38.820 --> 20:40.071
Tips?

20:41.072 --> 20:44.200
Welcome to
the third-world labor force, buddy.

20:53.834 --> 20:56.796
Why do they charge so much
for these things?

20:56.879 --> 20:59.465
Freeway robbery. Here, let me see.

21:00.383 --> 21:03.135
And what is the point of wearing this?

21:03.803 --> 21:06.847
Who cares about points?
The point is risk.

21:07.723 --> 21:09.517
Hey, would you do me a favor?

21:09.600 --> 21:11.644
Would you ask the salesgirl
for a larger size?

21:11.727 --> 21:13.145
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

21:13.229 --> 21:14.647
Excuse me.

21:15.064 --> 21:16.857
Yeah, may I help you?

21:17.650 --> 21:20.236
Yeah, my friend needs a larger size.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.405
Hey, hold it right there!

21:23.906 --> 21:25.908
- What?
- That one.

21:26.283 --> 21:28.410
- Give me the bag.
- And she's in on it, too.

21:28.494 --> 21:29.578
Me?

21:43.384 --> 21:45.677
You're really in trouble now.

21:54.353 --> 21:57.439
"The Labor Day barbecue was a bore
without you.

21:57.523 --> 22:00.984
<i>"Are the parties
like Down and Out in Beverly Hills?</i>

22:01.235 --> 22:03.654
"Please don't forget your old pal, Paula."

22:03.737 --> 22:05.280
Party hearty.

22:07.032 --> 22:08.367
I'm beat.

22:09.785 --> 22:12.537
People work hard out here
for their zillions.

22:12.621 --> 22:17.334
Yeah. Puritan ethic goes Beverly Hills,
leaving me to fend for myself.

22:18.543 --> 22:21.338
I know, honey. It's been an adjustment.

22:25.425 --> 22:28.136
It's quiet now without the kids.

22:29.763 --> 22:31.264
Kind of nice.

22:39.439 --> 22:41.733
It's good the kids have new lives.

22:41.816 --> 22:43.860
Oh, those girls.

22:44.945 --> 22:47.155
They're 16 going on 30.

22:48.740 --> 22:50.867
Tiffany had shifty eyes.

22:51.534 --> 22:53.870
That's what your father said about me.

22:53.995 --> 22:57.040
Well, you did. Shifty bedroom eyes.

23:03.755 --> 23:05.924
Okay, girls, I'm gonna call your parents.

23:06.007 --> 23:08.593
- Well, mine aren't home.
- We'll see.

23:12.180 --> 23:14.516
How could you do this to me?

23:14.599 --> 23:17.602
Aren't you being
just a little self-centered?

23:17.727 --> 23:20.480
You're the genius
that flagged me to the salesgirl.

23:20.563 --> 23:22.482
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

23:22.565 --> 23:24.359
Oh, would you relax?

23:24.442 --> 23:27.153
They've only got 10 minutes
to take us to the police station,

23:27.236 --> 23:29.030
or else we can sue.

23:29.656 --> 23:31.449
False imprisonment.

23:31.616 --> 23:33.993
Great. I'm in here with a pro.

23:35.328 --> 23:38.748
Brenda, you know
I stole that vest for you.

23:38.998 --> 23:41.667
Excuse me, but that just is not true.

23:41.918 --> 23:44.253
You were just too afraid
to do it yourself.

23:44.337 --> 23:46.172
I don't wanna hear it.

23:47.340 --> 23:49.550
I saw the look in your eye.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.054
Hey, I understand.

23:54.597 --> 23:56.933
It's the only time I feel alive.

23:57.183 --> 23:59.060
And I could buy anything.

23:59.435 --> 24:01.103
My heart bleeds.

24:01.395 --> 24:02.980
Don't talk to me.

24:04.523 --> 24:07.151
Okay. I won't talk to you.

24:07.401 --> 24:08.819
I'll talk to the owner.

24:08.903 --> 24:12.698
But if you wanna get out of here,
Brenda, just play along.

24:17.912 --> 24:19.205
What's this?

24:19.622 --> 24:23.334
- Oh, honey, no, that's...
- Oh, you old softie.

24:24.001 --> 24:26.712
Oh, honey, how thoughtful.

24:28.797 --> 24:31.759
Well... Sweetie, it's a little roomy.

24:32.009 --> 24:35.179
Actually, it's for me.

24:35.721 --> 24:37.389
I've got tennis tomorrow at a client's.

24:48.442 --> 24:51.195
- I'm really in trouble, aren't I?
- Yeah.

24:54.073 --> 24:57.034
God, you're working later
than your father.

24:57.117 --> 25:00.746
I'm burnt.
And I gotta clock in again tomorrow.

25:02.331 --> 25:07.336
I remember, back in the Stone Age,
I used to work two jobs in high school.

25:08.462 --> 25:09.963
Yeah, we know, Dad.

25:10.380 --> 25:14.134
And you walked miles through the snow,
kept up the old A average,

25:14.217 --> 25:16.261
carried your team to glory.

25:16.345 --> 25:19.431
All right, wise guy.
I'm proud about your job.

25:19.848 --> 25:22.059
Well, I'm exhausted, too.

25:22.142 --> 25:24.353
It's not easy keeping up
with Anna's pace.

25:28.023 --> 25:29.858
It's gotta be Brenda.

25:30.025 --> 25:33.195
"Hi, it's me.
I'm at this really sweet movie,

25:33.278 --> 25:35.030
"and there's, like,
these two really cool guys,

25:35.113 --> 25:37.449
"and they're with my ex-friend's
best friend."

25:40.452 --> 25:41.745
I'll get it.

25:44.664 --> 25:45.874
Yeah?

25:48.210 --> 25:49.836
Yes, this is he.

25:50.879 --> 25:52.297
That's impossible.

25:54.883 --> 25:56.676
I'll be right down.

25:57.218 --> 26:00.138
It's Brenda. They caught her shoplifting.

26:00.263 --> 26:02.474
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

26:03.141 --> 26:06.603
It's gotta be that Tiffany girl
you were talking about.

26:06.686 --> 26:09.272
You knew she was trouble, Cindy.
Why'd you let Brenda go with her?

26:09.355 --> 26:11.816
Don't put this on me! It's this place.

26:11.900 --> 26:14.652
It's all this appearance garbage.
It's contagious.

26:14.736 --> 26:17.197
Hey, hey, hey, where's your faith, guys?

26:17.280 --> 26:18.740
Brenda wouldn't steal.

26:18.823 --> 26:21.075
She's the one who made you
take her back to St Paul

26:21.159 --> 26:23.870
when she forgot to pay
for her Barbie doll, remember?

26:23.953 --> 26:25.455
I'm serious.

26:26.122 --> 26:28.458
That was before Beverly Hills.

26:33.713 --> 26:36.883
Look, there's been
a huge misunderstanding.

26:36.966 --> 26:39.802
I mean, why would I possibly steal?

26:40.345 --> 26:43.097
I don't know what it is with you kids.

26:43.639 --> 26:46.934
Listen, I can show you
$1,500 worth of bills

26:47.018 --> 26:51.189
that I personally have spent
in your store in the last month.

26:51.355 --> 26:53.858
My parents build shopping centers.

26:54.108 --> 26:55.610
Why would I steal?

26:56.319 --> 26:58.738
I have every single gold card.

27:01.199 --> 27:06.329
Listen, why don't I just pay
like I always do, like I intended,

27:06.412 --> 27:08.998
and you and I will just delete
this whole thing?

27:09.665 --> 27:11.125
Your choice.

27:18.049 --> 27:20.551
Well, it's not worth
wasting a day in court.

27:33.606 --> 27:36.609
It's lucky for you
the store owner didn't press charges.

27:36.692 --> 27:38.235
Brenda, what really happened?

27:38.319 --> 27:40.696
It was a big misunderstanding,
like he said.

27:40.779 --> 27:42.364
You don't sound so convinced to me.

27:42.448 --> 27:44.491
I didn't do anything wrong, I swear.

27:44.575 --> 27:48.329
Okay. Okay, honey.
If you say so, we believe you.

27:51.749 --> 27:53.459
It was so awful.

27:54.418 --> 27:58.255
I'm so ashamed you guys had
to come down here and pick me up.

27:59.757 --> 28:02.050
Can we please just forget it?

28:04.261 --> 28:05.763
Let's bury it.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.307
Account closed.

28:09.975 --> 28:11.101
Mom?

28:17.691 --> 28:19.359
Let's just go home.

28:37.377 --> 28:40.589
Hey, Jim!
Can we drop the power and just walk?

28:40.922 --> 28:42.132
I like this.

28:42.215 --> 28:44.426
You know, honey,
I'm gonna get you a warm-up suit, too.

28:44.509 --> 28:46.678
Well, frankly, it's not my style.

28:46.761 --> 28:50.307
And besides, my sweats are so beat up,
they're even trendy.

28:50.557 --> 28:51.975
Stealable.

28:52.225 --> 28:54.311
Honey, I thought we put that to bed.

28:54.394 --> 28:56.730
Well, what if she did steal?

28:57.522 --> 28:59.733
Kids steal. It's a phase.

28:59.816 --> 29:02.110
You know, getting away with something.

29:02.193 --> 29:04.362
I was always afraid I'd get caught.

29:04.446 --> 29:08.366
I have to confess, I once took
a can opener from J.C. Penney.

29:08.450 --> 29:09.868
I want a divorce.

29:09.951 --> 29:11.703
People with money are
the worst thieves of all.

29:11.786 --> 29:12.912
You should see
some of my clients' books.

29:12.996 --> 29:14.205
I don't believe it.

29:14.289 --> 29:15.623
No, it's true.
How do you think they got rich?

29:15.707 --> 29:17.584
No, no, Jim, I mean Anna.

29:17.667 --> 29:20.795
What's she doing here on a Saturday?
This has got to stop.

29:20.879 --> 29:22.130
Be kind.

29:22.213 --> 29:23.256
Hi.

29:23.965 --> 29:27.427
I cook you dinner.

29:39.731 --> 29:41.649
Kelly, why didn't you tell me
she's a klepto?

29:42.942 --> 29:45.611
We used to take a little stuff
in the 8th grade,

29:45.695 --> 29:47.864
but I could never wear anything I took.

29:48.531 --> 29:50.158
I could never take anything, but...

29:50.658 --> 29:53.494
No, with Tiff, it's like she had to do it.

29:53.578 --> 29:55.455
I mean, she stole everything.

29:55.538 --> 29:56.914
Including Steve.

29:57.457 --> 29:58.583
Your Steve?

29:59.792 --> 30:01.919
Yeah, but it was the way she did it.

30:02.003 --> 30:07.049
I mean, she wasn't interested in him,
just the idea of taking him, you know?

30:07.466 --> 30:09.510
<i>Klepto, nympho, all the O's.</i>

30:14.807 --> 30:17.310
Perfect. An antisocial cordless.

30:19.061 --> 30:22.523
- Mom, the phones are down again!
- Wonderful.

30:27.153 --> 30:28.988
Feeling better this morning?

30:29.864 --> 30:31.991
<i>Les miserable, c'est moi.</i>

30:33.367 --> 30:35.786
How could Tiff use me like that?

30:36.745 --> 30:39.415
You know, maybe I should have
told on her, but I just couldn't do it.

30:39.498 --> 30:41.542
Hey, hey, it's over now.

30:43.210 --> 30:45.754
We new kids in town
sure get a raw deal.

30:46.797 --> 30:48.716
It doesn't just go for the kids.

30:50.801 --> 30:53.929
These guys I work with,
Vietnamese, Israelis,

30:54.638 --> 30:57.808
they're like Grandpa was,
coming here with no money.

30:57.891 --> 31:00.144
They get completely exploited.

31:00.436 --> 31:03.313
Well, look in our own home,
with Mom hiring Anna.

31:03.397 --> 31:06.316
Yeah, but you can bet
Mom pays her fairly.

31:06.734 --> 31:09.903
These guys at my job
are working for pine nuts.

31:10.195 --> 31:12.948
Well, can't they do anything about it?

31:14.032 --> 31:15.534
I don't know.

31:20.205 --> 31:22.291
But you know what? They'll be fine.

31:22.958 --> 31:24.710
And so will you.

31:25.627 --> 31:27.546
So, what are my options again?

31:28.589 --> 31:33.218
Call forwarding, call waiting...
You know, I'd settle for call finishing.

31:33.343 --> 31:35.929
What do you mean,
I'm lucky to get a phone number?

31:36.013 --> 31:37.097
No, it's true, Mom.

31:37.180 --> 31:39.766
When Kelly got her car phone,
they didn't have a number for her.

31:39.850 --> 31:42.602
With all the cellulars,
they're bottoming out.

31:42.769 --> 31:44.688
Miss Cindy? I wash?

31:49.943 --> 31:51.486
I forgot about those.

31:51.570 --> 31:53.155
I wonder if the store did, too.

31:53.947 --> 31:55.824
I have to call you back.

31:56.700 --> 31:57.909
Mom!

32:07.502 --> 32:11.589
Mom, if you'd really think that of me,
you don't know who I am.

32:12.048 --> 32:14.634
Brenda, what am I supposed to think?

32:15.552 --> 32:19.097
Anna found this in your closet.
Tell me what to think, please.

32:19.931 --> 32:22.684
I could tell you, but I shouldn't have to.

32:23.017 --> 32:24.894
And I'm not going to.

32:26.229 --> 32:28.398
Just go ahead
and think the worst of me.

32:29.524 --> 32:32.694
What you did tell me was
how much you wanted things.

32:32.777 --> 32:36.406
I mean, that's all I heard,
how everybody else has everything.

32:38.199 --> 32:39.492
Look.

32:41.077 --> 32:42.495
It's okay.

32:45.039 --> 32:46.874
You went overboard.

32:46.958 --> 32:50.670
We can deal with this, but we just have
to be straight with each other.

32:50.753 --> 32:53.005
You know what? You're right.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.091
I did want things.

32:56.134 --> 32:59.011
It has been so hard for me here.

32:59.804 --> 33:01.931
Everyone here has
known everybody forever.

33:02.014 --> 33:05.017
All I wanted is to blend in like I used to.

33:05.726 --> 33:09.605
And not only won't you give me money,
but then you go and you get a maid!

33:09.689 --> 33:10.857
Look.

33:11.232 --> 33:14.277
She needs the money more than we do,
and she works for her money.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.738
Sorry, Mom. I am not Anna.
I am not Brandon. I'm not perfect!

33:17.822 --> 33:20.157
Well, neither am I!
You know it's been hard for me, too.

33:20.241 --> 33:21.826
I don't have my friends here.

33:21.909 --> 33:24.370
At least Anna is someone
that I can talk with.

33:24.453 --> 33:26.122
Maybe not with, but...

33:29.291 --> 33:31.877
Why would you need
three identical skirts?

33:32.962 --> 33:35.214
I mean, you left
all the price tags on, honey.

33:35.297 --> 33:37.258
Maybe you wanted to get caught.

33:38.551 --> 33:40.302
You know what I wanted?

33:40.594 --> 33:42.138
I'll tell you.

33:42.304 --> 33:45.015
I wanted to steal.
I wanted to steal, Mom!

33:45.099 --> 33:47.226
- Calm down.
- No, you calm down!

33:47.309 --> 33:48.727
I went into the store.

33:48.811 --> 33:51.939
I saw this gorgeous vest.
It was so much!

33:52.022 --> 33:55.776
It could have been so easy,
but I didn't do it. I couldn't.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.611
You know what else?

33:57.695 --> 33:59.738
You don't know me at all!

34:00.906 --> 34:02.157
Brenda!

34:12.000 --> 34:13.210
Sorry.

34:13.377 --> 34:15.838
You're 10 minutes sorry, Brendon.

34:15.920 --> 34:19.132
It's Brandon. Traffic was surreal.

34:20.509 --> 34:23.011
How many times do they redo
the streets around here anyway?

34:23.094 --> 34:26.974
Don't worry, Mr Early-come-lately.
We'll just dock your paycheck.

34:27.306 --> 34:29.685
This sucks.
I was 15 minutes early yesterday.

34:29.768 --> 34:33.605
Well, don't you know? This Town is
so cool, you gotta pay them to work.

34:33.688 --> 34:36.149
<i>Brendon, social hour is finito.</i>

34:36.565 --> 34:37.943
Chang!

34:38.150 --> 34:41.571
Never put round cups
with round saucers!

34:45.117 --> 34:46.326
Well, Chang,

34:46.409 --> 34:49.371
just gonna have to take you out back
and have the style police shoot you.

34:52.916 --> 34:55.918
Why didn't you bring the stuff over here
instead of my house?

34:56.002 --> 34:58.421
Look, what was I supposed to do?

34:58.713 --> 35:00.674
Bring the clothes here.

35:00.757 --> 35:02.008
No way.

35:02.425 --> 35:06.638
Oh, it's a crazy notion, I grant you.
I guess you don't have enough room.

35:07.097 --> 35:08.557
Very funny.

35:09.224 --> 35:13.228
You know, my parents already want to
dump me in a Swiss boarding school.

35:14.896 --> 35:16.773
It's easier for you.

35:16.856 --> 35:19.234
Your mom's the work-it-out type.

35:19.484 --> 35:22.320
Like you know
or care so much about me.

35:22.904 --> 35:26.783
Why do you take all those things,
Tiffany? You have so much.

35:26.991 --> 35:28.493
You think so?

35:30.036 --> 35:31.371
You know,

35:32.789 --> 35:35.542
once, on this student trip to Rome,

35:36.835 --> 35:40.547
I saw this cool wall
painted so it looked like a column.

35:40.630 --> 35:41.839
Trompe I'oeil.

35:43.174 --> 35:44.842
Fools the eye.

35:46.594 --> 35:49.222
It just looks like there's something.

35:50.515 --> 35:52.308
It's the same here.

35:53.267 --> 35:54.852
There's nothing.

35:56.813 --> 35:58.064
No one.

35:59.607 --> 36:01.609
Your folks aren't home?

36:02.735 --> 36:03.986
Folks.

36:04.737 --> 36:09.450
They're launching a shopping centre
in Boca Raton.

36:12.537 --> 36:14.288
They're never here.

36:16.290 --> 36:18.334
But it's cool, you know?

36:18.417 --> 36:20.545
I can do whatever I want.

36:21.420 --> 36:22.838
You sure do.

36:24.757 --> 36:26.008
Who are they?

36:27.802 --> 36:31.514
They're just dudes
who use the premises.

36:33.432 --> 36:35.559
Look, you wanna hang out
and take a hot tub?

36:36.560 --> 36:38.104
Forget about your mom.

36:38.187 --> 36:39.647
You don't get it, do you?

36:39.730 --> 36:42.316
Because I didn't tell on you,
my mom thinks I'm a thief.

36:45.486 --> 36:49.490
You can laugh if you want to,
but her opinion really matters to me.

36:49.573 --> 36:52.409
Why don't you just
go back to mommy, Brenda?

36:52.493 --> 36:55.287
Just go back to Minneapolis, all right?

36:55.871 --> 36:57.039
Fine.

37:06.131 --> 37:07.466
Table five wants you.

37:07.549 --> 37:10.844
I'll bet he does.
I have to think about my career.

37:11.261 --> 37:13.305
There's an agent at table seven.

37:16.642 --> 37:18.185
She's en route.

37:19.937 --> 37:23.774
Brendon, crumbers do not
talk to customers.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.486
Brandon, is there any possibility

37:27.569 --> 37:30.697
you could clear my table
before the Second Coming?

37:41.792 --> 37:43.085
Yo, boy!

37:44.127 --> 37:45.754
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:45.879 --> 37:47.255
"This Town.

37:48.006 --> 37:50.967
"This Town is eating experience
for the morning moments,

37:51.051 --> 37:55.722
"a medley of sage, cumin bouquets
and fragrant vegetable jewels."

37:59.851 --> 38:02.521
Many people would love your job.

38:04.105 --> 38:06.691
Yeah. Love that minimum wage.

38:06.858 --> 38:10.237
You get minimum wage?
Congratulations, man.

38:10.570 --> 38:13.490
- Yeah, right. Same to you.
- None of us do.

38:14.532 --> 38:17.786
- That's illegal.
- So? Who's gonna do anything?

38:27.587 --> 38:29.172
- Listen...
- I loathe apologies.

38:29.255 --> 38:31.299
Make it up to me, Brendon.
The cumins need filling.

38:31.383 --> 38:34.385
It's Brandon. Brandon Walsh.

38:34.719 --> 38:38.056
I'm an investigative reporter
for the West Beverly newspaper.

38:38.139 --> 38:39.557
And you can laugh if you want,

38:39.641 --> 38:42.602
but a lot of parents read that paper
and eat here.

38:42.685 --> 38:45.730
But they won't, not any more.
Not after I tell them

38:45.813 --> 38:48.524
how you scam your help
for under minimum wage!

38:48.608 --> 38:52.195
So you can take your cumin
and you can shove it.

38:55.239 --> 38:57.158
Take a load off, Minnesota.

38:57.241 --> 38:59.494
Dinner delectable? It's on me.

38:59.577 --> 39:02.163
Free at last. Free at last.

39:02.580 --> 39:04.207
Thank God Almighty.

39:04.290 --> 39:08.795
Excuse me. Could I get
a round cup and a round saucer?

39:08.878 --> 39:12.090
And I'd like it before
the Second Coming, please.

39:14.008 --> 39:15.426
Come on, now let's get out of here.

39:15.510 --> 39:19.055
Done deal. I know just the place.
We're out of here.

39:27.271 --> 39:30.816
The job wasn't just to support
my car insurance habit.

39:31.484 --> 39:32.985
My dad's always worked.

39:33.069 --> 39:35.029
He sounds as bonkers as me.

39:35.112 --> 39:39.533
I was 10 when I worked my first bit
character part in an old Bogie flick.

39:39.617 --> 39:42.745
Yeah, now there was a real pro
with a sweet tooth.

39:42.953 --> 39:45.498
Now I know why you dragged me
all the way out here.

39:45.581 --> 39:48.584
Best pie in LA.
Real food for real people.

39:48.709 --> 39:52.630
- Here's to real cups and real saucers.
- Take it or leave it.

39:54.131 --> 39:57.801
What I like is you get a real
cross-section of people, you know?

39:58.219 --> 39:59.470
Listen.

40:00.179 --> 40:03.974
Dylan here's been bugging me
about hiring someone to help me out.

40:04.058 --> 40:07.561
I figured who would be nuts enough
to want this bit?

40:08.270 --> 40:10.814
Take you. You look nuts enough.

40:11.940 --> 40:14.777
Take me. I'm nuts enough!

40:14.902 --> 40:18.030
I'll vouch for that.
I'll even waive my commission.

40:18.113 --> 40:21.075
- So when do I start?
- How about right now?

40:34.254 --> 40:35.464
Hello.

40:36.465 --> 40:38.050
Brenda's upstairs studying.

40:39.051 --> 40:42.304
That's okay. I just came over here
to get the stuff I left here.

40:46.433 --> 40:50.228
You know, the goods,
the contraband with price tags.

40:50.312 --> 40:51.647
Remember?

41:07.954 --> 41:10.874
I take it these are going back
where they came from.

41:13.585 --> 41:14.878
Tiffany.

41:16.463 --> 41:18.590
I know I'm not your mother.

41:19.215 --> 41:21.468
That's right. You're not.

41:22.886 --> 41:26.139
But I think maybe you should
talk to someone about this.

41:30.894 --> 41:33.813
My parents don't really have time,
you know.

41:33.897 --> 41:36.441
They just kind of off me on shrinks.

41:39.069 --> 41:40.570
I gotta go.

41:45.617 --> 41:49.704
I just wanted to tell you that it was me,
not Brenda.

41:50.622 --> 41:52.332
Your daughter's really cool.

41:53.625 --> 41:56.169
You ought to tell her to stay away
from people like me.

41:57.086 --> 41:59.714
Maybe you're not as bad
as you wanna be.

42:00.423 --> 42:03.217
Why don't you try
stealing your parents' attention?

42:04.761 --> 42:07.263
Yeah, that's what my shrink thinks
I'm trying to do.

42:08.765 --> 42:11.934
Maybe a more direct approach
would work better.

42:16.981 --> 42:20.193
You know, those malls,
they're so overstocked,

42:20.276 --> 42:21.944
they don't even miss the stuff.

42:22.028 --> 42:25.156
But if everyone thought that way,
there'd be nothing left.

42:25.239 --> 42:26.949
Nowhere to shop.

42:27.658 --> 42:29.368
Now that's scary.

42:34.540 --> 42:36.042
Thanks, Tiff.

42:45.718 --> 42:48.179
Hey. I got a real job.

42:48.971 --> 42:53.267
- Brandon, we already discussed this.
- The other gig was a false start.

42:54.059 --> 42:55.853
How'd your day pan out?

42:56.020 --> 42:57.521
Oh, very cool.

42:57.605 --> 42:59.732
I was accused,
un-accused, self-accused.

42:59.815 --> 43:01.650
Fought with Mom, lost a friend.

43:01.734 --> 43:05.196
But you know,
I finished reading a really good book.

43:06.405 --> 43:09.742
- "Jean Valjeen stole for..."
- Valjean, Brandon.

43:11.744 --> 43:14.330
"Jean Valjean stole for hunger.

43:14.788 --> 43:17.583
"Others steal for different kinds
of hunger.

43:17.666 --> 43:19.793
"There's the hunger to belong.

43:20.127 --> 43:21.587
"Many of us have had the urge,

43:21.670 --> 43:25.215
"but Jean Valjean acted
on his impulses."

43:25.924 --> 43:28.802
And there is a difference
between the two, honey.

43:30.053 --> 43:31.680
Your paper's beautiful.

43:31.764 --> 43:35.517
It's homework, Mom.
Homework is definitely not beautiful.

43:35.726 --> 43:38.729
Well, I'm sorry I jumped to conclusions.

43:39.396 --> 43:41.940
I know you well enough to trust you.

43:42.274 --> 43:43.984
You, on the other hand...

43:44.067 --> 43:45.611
Please, I'm reading.

43:48.113 --> 43:51.950
"There's emotional hunger.
Those people need understanding.

43:52.075 --> 43:55.537
"They can show greatness
and not let other people take the rap.

43:55.621 --> 43:57.914
"There are all kinds of hunger."

43:58.248 --> 44:02.044
Mine is the biggest hunger of them all.
They had the chintziest little,

44:02.127 --> 44:05.714
you couldn't even call them
sandwiches, at that tennis thing.

44:05.839 --> 44:07.841
California lean cuisine.

44:08.258 --> 44:11.178
- I missed you there, honey.
- Well, you missed a lot.

44:11.261 --> 44:14.264
You know, there is
Anna's melting-pot mystery meat.

44:15.599 --> 44:18.935
- Did you try it?
- I was so upset, I skipped dinner.

44:19.019 --> 44:21.730
Me, too. Stress diet. I like it.

44:22.022 --> 44:24.733
Oh, don't even talk to me about food.

44:24.816 --> 44:27.861
- I ate at both my jobs.
- You did?

44:28.278 --> 44:32.198
I had two jobs today.
Drove through miles of concrete.

44:32.282 --> 44:35.285
Miles of concrete. Way to go, Brandon.

44:38.204 --> 44:39.914
Way to go, Anna.
