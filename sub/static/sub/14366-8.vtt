WEBVTT

00:04.813 --> 00:08.243
<i>Will my torment never end?!</i>

00:08.245 --> 00:11.133
First I had to vie for
Megatron's favor against that

00:11.134 --> 00:14.236
treacherous harpy Airachnid.
Now I must contend with

00:14.238 --> 00:17.001
Shockwave and his incorrigible beast.

00:17.003 --> 00:19.266
Oh, look on the
bright side, Starscream.

00:19.268 --> 00:22.398
At least one of them is
currently on ice, locked up

00:22.400 --> 00:24.529
tight in the vault of our warship.

00:24.531 --> 00:27.094
How I would love to stuff

00:27.096 --> 00:30.701
Shockwave and his mangy
abomination right into that

00:30.703 --> 00:35.190
stasis pod beside her.
The only reason his project

00:35.192 --> 00:38.785
Predacon is currently in full
swing is because I supervised

00:38.787 --> 00:41.092
the acquisition of his
dozens of Predacon bones.

00:41.094 --> 00:44.916
Will you please keep your lab

00:44.918 --> 00:47.825
rat quiet while I'm
airing my grievances?

00:49.836 --> 00:53.741
Starscream, help... me.

00:54.583 --> 00:56.906
My, my, my.

00:56.908 --> 01:00.274
Whatever have you been
inflicting upon poor Silas?

01:00.276 --> 01:02.033
Well, anything that merits the

01:02.035 --> 01:03.900
need for a living petri dish.

01:11.257 --> 01:14.223
Despite your justifiable lack

01:14.225 --> 01:18.497
of regard for his human side,
it doesn't trouble you to watch

01:18.499 --> 01:21.611
what remains of your former
partner endure your

01:21.765 --> 01:25.019
- scientific endeavors?
- Not really.

01:25.021 --> 01:28.780
Besides, Silas once had poor
Breakdown pinned to his

01:28.782 --> 01:31.212
lab table. I think
my former partner would

01:31.214 --> 01:35.334
be pleased to be a part.

01:35.341 --> 01:38.058
What just happened?

01:38.060 --> 01:41.199
You recall that synthetic
Energon I recovered from the

01:41.201 --> 01:44.086
Autobots? Well, I've
been reproducing the

01:44.088 --> 01:48.370
formula to test its viability
as an alternative energy source.

01:48.372 --> 01:51.716
However, the compound remains erratic,

01:51.838 --> 01:56.310
- and there have been side effects.
- Such as...?

01:59.184 --> 02:00.855
Starscream, I hope you replaced

02:00.857 --> 02:04.162
your T-cog, because I'm going
to tear it out all over again and

02:04.164 --> 02:08.634
- feed it to Knockout!
- Sheer, unbridled aggression.

02:08.637 --> 02:13.792
Such power and fury!
Megatron has long desired

02:13.794 --> 02:16.438
a beast-machine supersoldier,

02:16.439 --> 02:21.678
and we now possess the means
of delivering one to him.

What is the status of their
incubation?

03:15.829 --> 03:17.842
Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh.

03:17.842 --> 03:22.088
Master, if I do say so
myself, I have made the most

03:22.088 --> 03:25.269
intriguing discovery.
It appears that ...

03:25.269 --> 03:29.025
Not now!
Please continue, Shockwave.

03:29.025 --> 03:30.941
No, no one important.

03:36.500 --> 03:40.932
Did you speak with our liege
about our little enterprise?

03:40.932 --> 03:45.338
He was... otherwise engaged.

03:45.348 --> 03:47.429
Rraaaaaaaaaahh!

03:47.864 --> 03:50.982
Oh, I am gonna make you suffer

03:50.982 --> 03:54.681
- in ways you will not believe!
- Just how much of this

03:54.681 --> 03:58.633
- Synth-En have you given him?
- Two additional doses ...

03:58.680 --> 04:01.786
three at the most.
But Silas' increasingly volatile

04:01.786 --> 04:04.895
nature isn't the only wrinkle.

04:14.109 --> 04:17.315
It appears that the more
green stuff I administer, the

04:17.315 --> 04:20.582
faster this monstrosity
formerly known as Breakdown

04:20.582 --> 04:23.838
burns through his own
natural Energon reserves.

04:23.838 --> 04:27.629
This will not do! Megatron
already possesses one

04:27.639 --> 04:30.292
unruly beast, with that Predacon of his!

04:30.292 --> 04:34.043
What good is another freak of
nature that cannot be controlled?

04:34.724 --> 04:38.485
Wait! I'm a fool.

04:39.799 --> 04:44.951
Dark Energon?!
You are more than a fool, Starscream!

04:44.951 --> 04:47.771
I think your neural cluster
has blown a massive fuse!

04:47.780 --> 04:50.917
Oh, on the contrary, dear Doctor.

04:50.917 --> 04:53.735
Adding Dark Energon to
the formula should provide

04:53.745 --> 04:58.082
Lord Megatron with full
control over his supersoldier.

04:58.092 --> 05:00.357
Okay. True that
lord Megatron seems to

05:00.357 --> 05:03.020
possess a symbiotic link to
any-one or... -thing infused with

05:03.020 --> 05:06.031
the dark matter, allowing him to
manipulate them as if they were

05:06.031 --> 05:09.796
puppets, but have you forgotten
what the so-called "Blood of

05:09.796 --> 05:13.099
- Unicron" did to our warship?
- That was the result of a

05:13.108 --> 05:16.706
massive infusion. I am
suggesting a drop or two ...

05:16.706 --> 05:19.350
merely enough to allow our
Master to command

05:19.545 --> 05:22.925
-  his warrior at will.
- Even so, it's too drastic

05:22.935 --> 05:25.616
a measure to undertake
without Shockwave's approval.

05:25.616 --> 05:30.546
- I do, after all, report to him.
- Not on this project!

05:30.556 --> 05:34.250
Supersoldiers fall under
military operations, meaning,

05:34.250 --> 05:38.039
dear Knockout, that
you now report to me.

05:38.039 --> 05:41.841
Are we clear?

05:54.827 --> 05:56.790
Wait for it.

06:03.660 --> 06:08.492
Humans in any form
cannot be relied upon.

06:10.815 --> 06:12.489
It's alive!

06:12.489 --> 06:17.017
- Aah! Oh!
- Scrap!

06:27.875 --> 06:31.197
Oh, for the love of...
now what?!

06:31.197 --> 06:35.491
I tried to tell you before ...
it's a side effect of the Synth-En

06:35.491 --> 06:36.515
He's burned through his own

06:36.515 --> 06:39.247
- natural reserves.
- Then perhaps we should

06:39.247 --> 06:43.357
withhold any infusions for a while ...
might calm Silas down

06:43.357 --> 06:46.966
a bit, make him
a tad more manageable.

06:46.966 --> 06:51.825
<i>Need... Energon.</i>

07:23.977 --> 07:25.407
Do you think he's actually trying to...

07:25.407 --> 07:27.409
Suck out our Energon with that thing?

07:29.896 --> 07:31.209
Sure seems that way.

07:38.556 --> 07:40.065
See if you can hold him off!

07:40.065 --> 07:44.146
W-what?!
Wait for me!

08:01.126 --> 08:01.984
We need to...

08:01.993 --> 08:04.550
- sound the alarm!
- Out of the question!

08:04.550 --> 08:07.369
Megatron will undoubtedly
hold us responsible.

08:07.369 --> 08:11.196
- But... we are!
- Well, you are, mostly.

08:11.196 --> 08:14.250
Anyway, his lordship doesn't
need to know that ... not if we

08:14.250 --> 08:17.486
- handle this the right way.
- Meaning?!

08:17.486 --> 08:20.509
Use your head, Knockout!
This ship is crawling with

08:20.509 --> 08:23.492
highly trained Vehicon
troopers, armed for combat.

08:23.492 --> 08:26.799
The moment Silas attempts to feed, they

08:26.799 --> 08:30.103
will neutralize him
for us. Problem solved.

08:42.428 --> 08:46.334
Once we recover Silas' body,
we must dispose of it as quickly

08:46.334 --> 08:49.017
and efficiently as possible.
No trace of him can be allowed

08:49.017 --> 08:51.146
- to remain.
- His...

08:51.865 --> 08:53.614
...infected body.

09:00.400 --> 09:04.190
Gone.
Completely drained of Energon.

09:04.190 --> 09:08.021
Tell me something, Starcream ...
when you said "problem solved,"

09:08.021 --> 09:10.644
is this even close to
what you had in mind?!

09:10.644 --> 09:13.822
I do not appreciate
your tone, Knockout.

09:13.822 --> 09:16.983
This brewing catastrophe is
hardly my fault.

09:16.983 --> 09:20.375
- Well, it certainly isn't mine!
- Oh, no?

09:20.375 --> 09:23.843
You're the Mastermind who chose
to experiment with

09:23.843 --> 09:26.701
-  synthetic Energon.
- And you're the monkey wrench

09:26.701 --> 09:30.104
who thought it was a good
idea to dabble in voodoo!

09:33.320 --> 09:35.498
Energon!

09:37.239 --> 09:41.183
- I thought you said he had no spark!
- Dark Energon ...

09:41.359 --> 09:43.138
it reanimates the dead!

09:46.482 --> 09:49.495
- Raaaah!
- Aim for the head!

09:49.505 --> 09:53.129
- What?! How do you know?!
- I have seen human horror films!

09:54.656 --> 09:56.649
At drive-in theaters!

10:07.991 --> 10:11.228
Forget the head!
Go for the spark!

10:17.004 --> 10:19.627
We severed its link
to the Dark Energon.

10:19.627 --> 10:22.388
Human horror films ...
waste of time.

10:29.327 --> 10:31.144
Energon.

10:34.674 --> 10:37.824
If the mutation can be passed
along with a single bite, the

10:37.824 --> 10:40.709
entire crew is at risk.

10:40.709 --> 10:44.568
You're saying Silas could
beget more Terrorcons?

10:44.568 --> 10:47.456
Mm, could happen. And
the ensuing feeding frenzy

10:47.456 --> 10:50.244
could turn this entire
warship into a scrap heap.

10:50.244 --> 10:53.102
So now can we sound the alarm?

10:55.125 --> 10:58.186
You, there ... have you
noticed any unusual activity?

11:00.141 --> 11:03.055
in... this... sector?

11:26.080 --> 11:27.639
<i>Let's go!</i>

11:30.651 --> 11:32.566
<i>In here!</i>

11:34.363 --> 11:38.136
Knockout, this situation might
be a bit more dire

11:38.300 --> 11:41.391
- than either of us ever imagined.
- Mm.

11:41.391 --> 11:44.375
I find it rather ironic that
after battling Autobots all

11:44.375 --> 11:48.040
these years, getting smacked
down, shot at, blown up,

11:48.137 --> 11:51.800
- this is how our lights go out.
- Drained of our precious

11:51.800 --> 11:55.855
fluids. If this is indeed
the end, if we are to become

11:55.855 --> 11:59.908
Terrorcon chow, it has
been an honor serving

11:59.908 --> 12:04.320
- Lord Megatron with you.
- You're no Breakdown.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.010
Though I must confess ...

12:06.109 --> 12:09.831
I have always admired
your lustrous finish.

12:14.663 --> 12:18.132
- Well, then...
- We should be going.

12:29.329 --> 12:31.457
Would either of you like to tell me

12:31.546 --> 12:35.356
- what exactly is going on?!
- Y-yes.

12:35.356 --> 12:39.409
- Absolutely nothing, my liege.
- All is quiet ... too quiet.

12:39.409 --> 12:43.171
- One could even say "dull."
- Funny... because the Dark

12:43.171 --> 12:46.585
Energon within my
spark has been pulsing.

12:46.585 --> 12:49.074
Allow me to handle this.

12:49.074 --> 12:52.316
- It's Knockout's fault!
- Precisely my ... What?!

12:52.316 --> 12:55.302
He infused Silas with a
cocktail comprised of Dark and

12:55.302 --> 12:58.478
synthetic Energon, creating a
monstrous mutation, which is now

12:58.478 --> 13:01.202
on the verge of turning your
entire crew into mindless

13:01.212 --> 13:04.906
- Energon-sucking Terrorcons!
- I do not know from what

13:04.906 --> 13:10.154
madness your yarn springs,
Starscream, but if I learn that

13:10.164 --> 13:13.496
you have been dabbling with
my Dark Energon stores again,

13:13.496 --> 13:16.997
attempting to infuse yourself
with its formidable power...

13:17.006 --> 13:21.671
- Uh, my liege?
- ...let me just say, you have

13:21.671 --> 13:23.916
been awarded more chances
for redemption

13:24.052 --> 13:28.971
than anyone in Decepticon history!

13:28.971 --> 13:33.083
- Energon!
- Hey, you, there ...

13:33.093 --> 13:36.397
What are you doing?
I order you ... stand down!

13:45.339 --> 13:49.500
- We did try to tell you.
- Mm-hmm.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.312
Then why can I not command
the monster

13:52.312 --> 13:54.594
-  to follow my bidding?
- While the trace of Dark

13:54.594 --> 13:58.548
Energon should have granted
you control over these ghouls,

13:58.548 --> 14:00.852
I believe the synthetic component
may be corrupting

14:00.949 --> 14:04.188
- your link to them.
- Initiate high alert.

14:04.188 --> 14:06.656
Instruct all troops to
keep their distance from the

14:06.656 --> 14:10.903
mutations and terminate on sight.

14:10.903 --> 14:14.247
Your fate, however,
remains to be seen.

14:16.181 --> 14:22.062
Why are you still here?!
Find this creation of yours

14:22.062 --> 14:25.046
and eradicate it ... immediately!

14:28.983 --> 14:32.084
I realize lord Megatron's
only doing this to punish us,

14:32.084 --> 14:35.165
but how are we the best
choice to hunt down Silas?

14:35.165 --> 14:37.694
I mean, why not deploy
his beloved beast-machine

14:37.694 --> 14:40.843
supersoldier, hm?
After all, it is supposed to be

14:40.843 --> 14:43.398
- the ultimate hunter.
- Out of the question.

14:43.398 --> 14:46.576
Can you imagine if the
Predacon became infected?

14:46.576 --> 14:48.976
Nothing could stop it.

15:44.301 --> 15:46.381
Energon.

15:55.489 --> 15:59.387
Breakdown?
Did I not exterminate you once already?

16:45.848 --> 16:48.142
Energon!

17:01.495 --> 17:03.495
Second time's the charm.

17:04.592 --> 17:07.459
But to be certain...

17:07.459 --> 17:11.249
I shall remove your very spark.

17:11.249 --> 17:14.913
Silas?
What ever have they done to you?

17:14.913 --> 17:17.922
Ah, but more importantly,

17:17.931 --> 17:23.056
- thank you for freeing me.
- No. Thank... you.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.384
Whatever.

17:29.995 --> 17:31.970
Insecticons, heed me.

17:31.970 --> 17:36.547
<i>Heed me. Heed me.</i>

17:37.520 --> 17:40.465
<i>Your Queen has returned.</i>

18:01.733 --> 18:06.961
- Our ordeal is finally over!
- Or not.

18:09.586 --> 18:11.442
<i>- Scrap!
- Starscream.</i>

18:11.442 --> 18:13.716
<i>Have you made contact with</i>

18:13.716 --> 18:16.856
<i>- the plague bringer?
- Actually, my liege, I have</i>

18:16.856 --> 18:18.412
good news.

18:18.421 --> 18:21.395
<i>And... bad news.</i>

18:27.024 --> 18:30.289
Loyal servants, the time is now.

18:30.289 --> 18:33.564
Lay waste to all Decepticons.

18:33.564 --> 18:37.717
Leave no trace of them in your wake.

18:39.028 --> 18:40.604
Soundwave!

18:47.815 --> 18:49.847
I vow that on this day,

18:49.904 --> 18:53.821
the world will hear the sound
of your screams!

19:14.680 --> 19:17.568
<i>Nooo!</i>

19:25.216 --> 19:28.531
Yes.
The containment protocol you

19:28.531 --> 19:31.486
recommended to prevent
any further outbreak is now

19:31.486 --> 19:35.811
under way. Oh, and, Shockwave,
having just lost more

19:35.811 --> 19:40.147
than half our military might,
I cannot stress enough

19:40.147 --> 19:42.451
the importance of project Predacon.

19:42.451 --> 19:46.114
See if you can...
speed things along, will you?

19:47.086 --> 19:49.712
Knockout, need I remind you

19:49.712 --> 19:53.638
that, as the ship's medic, you
report directly to Shockwave,

19:53.638 --> 19:56.720
- not Starscream.
- Understood, Master.

19:56.720 --> 20:01.092
Just to be sure, you will
hand over all of your projects

20:01.092 --> 20:07.227
to him immediately,
including this synthetic Energon.

20:07.227 --> 20:11.959
- As you wish, my liege.
- And as for you...

Approach me.
Serve your Queen.
