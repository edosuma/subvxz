WEBVTT

00:31.198 --> 00:33.098
[subway approaching]

00:38.672 --> 00:40.105
[silence]

00:43.677 --> 00:45.811
¶¶¶

01:01.562 --> 01:04.363
-[Oliver] Chapter one--
-[Max] Oh, really? You're
gonna lead with that?

01:04.365 --> 01:06.532
-With the black and the
white and everything?
-Too much?

01:06.534 --> 01:08.623
Why are you avoiding
the question?

01:08.624 --> 01:10.713
[Oliver] I'm not avoiding
the question.

01:10.714 --> 01:12.803
I told you before;
I like his films, and
he's extremely prolific.

01:12.807 --> 01:16.775
I just find him to be a tad
inauthentic and way too
derivative of his influences.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.161
[Max] Yeah, I don't know
-- you know -- I -- I --

01:19.162 --> 01:21.546
I sometimes think you
don't like certain things
just because other people do.

01:21.549 --> 01:25.284
[Oliver] No. I just don't agree
with the amount of importance
people place on winning awards.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.303
[Max] Yeah, but
awards are important.

01:27.304 --> 01:29.321
[Oliver] Yes, insomuch
as winning them can help
get your next project funded,

01:29.323 --> 01:33.092
but you cannot judge art. There
are no bests, only favorites.

01:33.094 --> 01:36.312
[Max] I'm pretty sure some works
of art are better than others.

01:36.313 --> 01:39.531
[Oliver] Hey, let me ask you
something: If you knew you could
make any film you wanted to --

01:39.533 --> 01:42.267
anything you wanted to make,
what would you write?

01:42.269 --> 01:45.237
[Max] I don't know,
maybe something about the
troubling times we live in.

01:45.239 --> 01:48.107
-[Oliver] Which troubles
specifically?
-[Max] Christ, take your pick...

01:48.109 --> 01:51.143
I mean, you got cops
are shooting unarmed black
men at an alarming rate;

01:51.145 --> 01:54.313
you can't go to a movie theater
without worrying some psycho's
going to shoot the place up;

01:54.315 --> 01:57.416
government's out of control;
education is pathetically low;

01:57.418 --> 02:00.019
women are still fighting
for equal pay;

02:00.020 --> 02:02.621
you got whole families that are
starving in the most food-
wasting nation on the planet;

02:02.623 --> 02:05.657
and you got an income
gap that makes the Grand
Canyon look like a divot.

02:05.659 --> 02:09.761
[Oliver] Yes, all very important
subjects which I would
sadly do no justice;

02:09.763 --> 02:13.465
but I'm talking about
something you could shoot
with very little money.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.135
-[Max] Oh, okay --
like your films?
-[Oliver] Yes.

02:16.137 --> 02:18.337
[Max] Okay, so something
along the lines of this?

02:18.339 --> 02:19.838
[Oliver] If that's what
you found interesting.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.140
[Max] I don't think
I'd lead with this.

02:21.142 --> 02:23.342
I mean, empty shots
of Manhattan

02:23.343 --> 02:25.543
with the random
dialogue floating over them
is just not exactly riveting.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.280
[Oliver] I'm not asking you
how you would start the film,

02:28.282 --> 02:31.283
I'm asking you what it
would be about overall.
You know, in a nutshell?

02:31.285 --> 02:32.484
[Max] Why don't you just tell
me what you're working on?

02:32.486 --> 02:35.487
I'll tell you if I think
it's interesting.

02:35.488 --> 02:38.489
[Oliver] Okay, so far, all I
know is it's gonna be two guys
walking around New York City,

02:38.492 --> 02:42.728
talking about their core
belief on life, love, etc,
cut between two women,

02:42.730 --> 02:46.632
the main guy's girlfriend and
her best friend, discussing
what's on their minds.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.268
[Max] So another
movie about you?

02:49.269 --> 02:51.903
[Oliver] Yeah, no -- sort of...
I mean, not about me, but

02:51.906 --> 02:54.439
things I'm going through
or have gone through.

02:54.441 --> 02:57.059
[Max] Mmm, who's
playing you this time?

02:57.060 --> 02:59.678
[Oliver] In order to save
the most money, I figure
I gotta play myself.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.313
[Max] Okay. Then can I play me?

03:01.315 --> 03:03.616
[Oliver] But,
you're not an actor.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.918
[Max] What acting?
You said two guys walk around
the city talking to each other.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.853
We do that all the time.
How hard could that be?

03:07.855 --> 03:10.172
[Oliver] Yeah, okay,
we'll play ourselves.

03:10.173 --> 03:12.490
[Max] Wait, wait, wait -- don't
you think that's going to be
confusing to the audience?

03:12.493 --> 03:13.959
[Oliver] Why would it
be confusing?

03:13.961 --> 03:17.262
[Max] Because, we would be
in the beginning as ourselves,

03:17.264 --> 03:18.964
discussing how you're
going to make a film

03:18.966 --> 03:21.867
about these other guys who
we would also be playing.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.136
[Oliver] What are
you talking about?

03:24.137 --> 03:26.404
I -- I wouldn't put us
in the film as ourselves
and as characters.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.639
That would be absurd.

03:27.641 --> 03:31.143
[Max] I thought that's
what you were going for.

03:31.144 --> 03:34.646
[Oliver] I'm not Buñuel...
Although, that is an
interesting concept:

03:34.648 --> 03:38.350
a guy tells his friend about a
film he's planning on making,

03:38.352 --> 03:43.722
but that discussion is actually
the beginning of the film and
leads into the fictional story,

03:43.724 --> 03:47.793
in which two of those
characters are actually
played by these same two guys.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.630
-But how would that work?
-[Max] I don't know.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.350
Have you thought of a title?

03:54.351 --> 03:56.335
[Oliver] Yeah, I've come up
with some ideas but I haven't
settled on one just yet.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.003
[Max] How about,
<i> The Narcissists</i> ?

03:58.005 --> 04:00.239
[Oliver] Yeah -- how 'bout I get
someone else to play you?

04:00.241 --> 04:02.808
[Max] Whatever you're planning
on titling it is just fine...

04:02.809 --> 04:05.376
[Oliver] Yeah, well, the title
doesn't exactly matter
if I can't write it first.

04:05.779 --> 04:09.514
-[Max] You have writer's block?
-[Oliver] It's more like, what's
the purpose of making anything

04:09.516 --> 04:11.733
in this meaningless
world block?

04:11.734 --> 04:13.951
[Max] Oh Christ, Oliver, I'm not
in the mood for an existential
discussion right now.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.687
[Oliver] Well, it's
a tad unavoidable

04:15.688 --> 04:17.421
being as that I'm in the midst
of an existential crisis.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.625
[Max] Yeah, but you're
always in the midst of
an existential crisis.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.693
It's like your single most
defining characteristic.

04:21.695 --> 04:25.831
[Oliver] Yeah, because
life is totally meaningless
and terrible,

04:25.833 --> 04:27.866
and we're all
gonna die one day.

04:27.867 --> 04:29.900
And -- and don't get me started
on where goose down comes from.

04:29.903 --> 04:32.671
[Max] Listen, I know what
you're trying to do, and believe
me, you're much saner,

04:32.673 --> 04:35.574
you're much happier,
with Cassi, so you
need to fight for her.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.126
[Oliver] She cheated on me.

04:37.127 --> 04:38.677
[Max] Big deal, she made out
with an ex-boyfriend
a few times.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.279
[Oliver] Yeah, and
they almost had sex!

04:40.281 --> 04:42.381
[Max] But, they didn't.
And almost sex isn't sex.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.383
And, would it be that big a
deal if they had fucked?

04:44.385 --> 04:46.635
[Oliver] Oh, well, when you
put it to me that way, yeah -

04:46.636 --> 04:48.886
[Max] I mean, tell me the truth,
were you really that surprised
when she confessed?

04:48.889 --> 04:49.921
[Oliver] What are you implying?

04:49.923 --> 04:52.658
[Max] It's just that, you've
broken up, what, twice in the
five years you've been together?

04:52.659 --> 04:55.394
It's not exactly like you had
the perfect relationship.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.729
[Oliver] Oh, oh, oh -- so -- so
now you're saying that
I'm somehow responsible

04:57.731 --> 04:59.031
for Cassi's cheating on me.

04:59.033 --> 05:02.768
[Max] Six months ago
you told me that you guys
were barely having sex.

05:02.770 --> 05:05.637
That she wanted to
but you weren't feeling
it, or some shit.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.307
[Oliver] No. That -- that
-- that's the natural ebb
and flow of passion

05:08.309 --> 05:09.875
in long term relationships.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.442
[Max] Yeah, well, some
people need to make
love to their partner

05:11.445 --> 05:13.512
in order to feel actually loved.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.580
-[Oliver] Since when did
you become Dr. Ruth?
-[Max]Hey, I observe.

05:15.582 --> 05:18.383
I see what's going on
in the world, I just don't
want any part of it.

05:18.385 --> 05:20.652
And, I'm just pointing out
that you do still love Cassi,

05:20.654 --> 05:21.987
and you need to do what
you can to work things
out with her. That's all.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.690
That's why we're apart.
I'm figuring it all out.

05:24.692 --> 05:27.209
Yeah, well, don't take too long.

05:27.210 --> 05:29.727
I can't, ha-- Have you not
been listening to me?!
I can't take too long.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.863
We have to figure out
whether or not we're
gonna renew the lease,

05:31.865 --> 05:34.466
because neither
one of us can afford the
apartment on our own.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.835
-Forget the lease.
-Max, this is New York.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.938
-You're right. Take
care of the lease.
-That's what we're doing.

05:39.940 --> 05:43.041
You know, my Uncle Maurice,
he had a homosexual
relationship for four years,

05:43.043 --> 05:44.643
just so he could
have stabilized rent--

05:44.645 --> 05:46.662
[Oliver] Okay, okay,
alright -- now look.

05:46.663 --> 05:48.680
Let me just finish telling
you about the story I've
been working on, alright?

05:48.682 --> 05:51.606
[Max] Yeah.

05:51.607 --> 05:54.531
[Oliver] So Cassi's been
staying at her sister's house
on the Upper West Side.

05:54.532 --> 05:57.456
When we first see her,
she's walking up the street to
meet her best friend, Letty...

06:00.060 --> 06:02.728
[Cassi] Oh, thank God! Let
me have a drag... please.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.314
[Letty] You're not
worried she'll see?

06:05.315 --> 06:06.932
[Cassi] A week ago I would have
said yes without hesitation.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.768
-[Letty] But...?
-[Cassi] Just give
me the cigarette.

06:10.371 --> 06:13.138
-[Letty] Oh, wow--
That bad, huh?
-[Cassi] Yeah...

06:13.974 --> 06:17.042
But believe me
it is not the couch.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.443
[Letty] I didn't think
it was the couch.

06:18.445 --> 06:22.481
[Cassi] The couch is nicer
than anything Oliver and I
have in our apartment.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.483
My sister, on the other hand...

06:25.552 --> 06:26.752
[Letty] Same old Erin.

06:26.754 --> 06:31.656
[Cassi] It's as if -- It's
as if it's not enough for
her to be doing amazing,

06:31.658 --> 06:36.128
things have to be miserable
for me in order for her to truly
enjoy her own success.

06:36.130 --> 06:38.930
[Letty] Okay, well, my offer
still stands, so--

06:38.932 --> 06:42.467
[Cassi] Thank you.
I love you, but it's
just easier this way.

06:42.469 --> 06:43.835
And, besides, if I
moved in with you now,

06:43.837 --> 06:45.837
my mother would be convinced
I were a lesbian.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.939
[Letty] Yeah, but,
she knows you're not, so--

06:47.941 --> 06:49.908
[Cassi] Yeah, but she's
not so sure about you.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.011
[Letty] Really?
You never told me that.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.781
[Cassi] I've never
been this tired.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.983
[Letty] Well, did
she tell you why?

06:57.984 --> 06:59.884
Is it the way, I don't
know-- is the way
I dress or how I talk?

06:59.887 --> 07:02.120
Is it my haircut or something?
Like, what-- [laughs]

07:02.122 --> 07:05.157
[Cassi] Nah, I think
it has more to do with the
fact that we are now thirty

07:05.159 --> 07:07.058
and you still
remain autonomous.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.145
[Letty] I'm not a country.

07:10.146 --> 07:12.430
[Cassi] I thought it
sounded better than
"perpetually single."

07:13.000 --> 07:16.601
[Letty] Yeah, well that's
a choice, because relationships
are bullshit and don't work.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.136
I mean, hello.

07:18.806 --> 07:21.573
[Cassi] Okay, believe me, the
irony is not wasted on me...

07:22.075 --> 07:24.843
but, I mean, I'm just...
That's my mom.

07:25.746 --> 07:29.548
Anyway, at this point,
I wish I were a lesbian,
just to freak her out.

07:30.517 --> 07:33.185
[Letty] So, Debbie's
being Debbie.

07:33.187 --> 07:35.887
[Cassi] No, Debbie's
being El Diablo.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.890
[Letty] Still better than my
mom, El No Show.

07:39.693 --> 07:45.030
[Cassi] And, she's so down
on Oliver, like it's as if she's
in the relationship with him.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.799
[Letty] Didn't I tell you from
the beginning that I thought she
was way too keen on him?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.901
[Cassi] Yeah, well
now it's the opposite.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.605
[Letty] It's the same thing.
You can't hate someone
you don't truly love.

07:54.141 --> 07:57.609
[Cassi] Don't be ridiculous.
That would mean that every
Jew really loves Hitler.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.579
-[Letty] Okay, let me
rephrase that--
-[Cassi] Yeah--

08:00.581 --> 08:02.881
[Letty] There's a certain
kind of frustration and anger

08:02.883 --> 08:05.050
that comes only with
those whom you truly love.

08:06.153 --> 08:10.088
[Cassi] And the worst part
is, I haven't told her that
this is all my own doing,

08:10.090 --> 08:14.092
so her anger at Oliver
instantly becomes my guilt.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.695
[Letty] Yeah, well, forget
about how your mom feels,

08:16.697 --> 08:17.963
you have to figure out
what you want to do.

08:17.965 --> 08:23.034
-[Cassi] Can't you do it?
-[Letty] Believe me, you don't
want me doing it.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.104
[Cassi] I'm seriously stuck.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.774
[Letty] Okay, let's just--
let's -- let's figure out
where we're gonna eat

08:29.776 --> 08:31.076
and start walking
in that direction.

08:31.078 --> 08:34.797
[Cassi] Well, I was thinking we
could walk down to the Crosby,
or somewhere else in SoHo?

08:34.798 --> 08:38.517
[Letty] Ugh, no, babe...
I'm not walking eighty
blocks just to eat lunch.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.985
Let's just, let's
just stay nearby.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.721
[Cassi] It's so nice out, it'll
be beautiful down there.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.823
[Letty] Yeah, but
it's nice here too.

08:44.824 --> 08:46.924
Let's just, okay, let's
just go to Whole Foods
and sit in the park.

08:46.927 --> 08:51.830
[Cassi] No, no, no -- I'm
sick of staying above 58th.
My creativity is waning.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.266
[Letty] Wow, you're having
hipster withdrawal.

08:54.268 --> 08:56.902
[Cassi] I live in Brooklyn
Heights, not Bushwick.

08:57.671 --> 09:01.156
[Letty] Let's just -- let's
just go Upper East.

09:01.157 --> 09:04.642
[Cassi] No, Letty, I am not -- I
don't want to be surrounded by
spoiled, snobby housewives.

09:04.645 --> 09:08.914
[Letty] No, you'd rather be
around spoiled, snobby college
kids and nameless models.

09:09.216 --> 09:13.018
But, if we go Upper East,
by the time we're done,
I'll already be home.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.686
[Cassi] Oh, gee, thanks.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.854
[Letty] You know what I mean.

09:15.856 --> 09:19.891
[Cassi] Letty, please,
can we just walk a bit
and eat downtown?

09:19.893 --> 09:23.028
I really need
a change of scenery.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.766
[Letty] Fine, but let's just,
let's walk to the
seventy-second station

09:27.768 --> 09:30.702
and take the subway from there.
Otherwise I will be over-walked
by the time we get downtown.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.238
[Cassi] Awe, your precious feet.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.606
[Letty] Oh, fuck you!

09:34.608 --> 09:37.142
[Cassi] [laughing] There she is!

09:41.214 --> 09:43.248
-[Oliver] Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa--
-[Max] Hit... hit that.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.283
[Oliver] What are you doing,
man? You can't just smoke
that shit anywhere.

09:45.284 --> 09:47.318
[Max] Dude, it's not
nineteen-ninety anymore.
Everybody smokes pot.

09:47.321 --> 09:49.054
[Oliver] Everybody
doesn't smoke pot.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.440
[Max coughing] Everybody
does smoke pot!

09:51.441 --> 09:53.825
And this is an electronic
atomizer, so you can't
smell what I'm smoking.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.660
Trust me, people just
assume it's tobacco.

09:55.662 --> 09:58.497
Okay, look, look,
look, look, look...

09:58.498 --> 10:01.333
Nobody assumes it's tobacco
and you look like you're
sucking on a plastic dick.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.703
So you're gay bashing now?
You, of all people?

10:04.705 --> 10:07.138
What? No, I'm not gay bashing.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.907
And, what do you mean,
me "of all people?"

10:08.909 --> 10:10.675
No, no, I'm just -- you know,
I'm merely pointing out,

10:10.677 --> 10:12.944
that with your history
of sexual experimentation,

10:12.946 --> 10:15.680
you might not want
to use fellatio as
an insult. That's all.

10:15.983 --> 10:20.619
Okay, look, note taken.
But please, Max, just put
the fucking pipe away.

10:20.621 --> 10:24.656
Okay, look -- I'm gonna
assume this is all stress
related to Cassi, okay?

10:24.658 --> 10:27.692
I'm not take any offense,
and look, putting the fucking
pipe away right now.

10:27.694 --> 10:29.327
-Thank you--
-But, I just want
to go on record,

10:29.329 --> 10:31.029
saying that if you
took a few puffs of that,

10:31.031 --> 10:32.831
it's gonna fix all
of your problems.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.800
You know that I quit
smoking because it
gave me panic attacks.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.936
You had one lousy attack
four years ago.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.372
If you just try smoking
a little bit, it probably
wouldn't happen again.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.310
Let me ask you something:
why did you want to
hang out with me today?

10:46.313 --> 10:48.346
Because, you seemed
really down last night, okay?

10:48.348 --> 10:50.148
And I just want to make
sure you're all right.

10:50.851 --> 10:51.950
I mean, is that alright?

10:51.952 --> 10:55.286
Is it okay that I want to be
here for my best friend in
his time of need, huh?

10:55.288 --> 10:56.988
My buddy, my<i> paisan</i> ...

10:56.990 --> 10:58.156
My prairie home companion.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.924
Okay. All right, yes.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.193
It's just, you know-- sometimes
you're a little strange.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.546
-Oh, I'm strange?
-Yeah--

11:04.547 --> 11:06.898
Well, listen: uh, you know,
I'm not the one picking a
fight with his best friend

11:06.900 --> 11:09.267
because he decided to be
nice, hang out with you,

11:09.269 --> 11:12.671
walk around the city, talk
about your troubles,
forget your problems...

11:12.673 --> 11:14.072
I think that's a little odd.

11:14.074 --> 11:18.710
You're right, I'm sorry. I don't
mean to attack you. It's just,

11:18.712 --> 11:22.414
I'm freaking out lately, you
know -- I, I... I apologize...

11:23.684 --> 11:24.382
Thank you.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.386
But I really do think if
you took a few puffs...

11:32.826 --> 11:34.137
[puffs]

11:34.138 --> 11:35.449
I'm not even responding to that.

11:35.450 --> 11:36.761
-It's-- I don't know what
to say to you anymore.
-Come on, dude.

11:36.763 --> 11:39.898
-It's ridiculous.
-I'm just saying, bro.
it's medicinal.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.034
Okay, come on,
Smokey. Let's go.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.836
[Max] Weirdo.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.040
[Letty] So, I had an
epiphany recently.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.976
[Cassi]Oh, please, not another
insight about my relationship.

11:51.978 --> 11:55.280
[Letty] It's not about you
guys, but it does relate
to human beings as a whole.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.016
[Cassi]Alright, just spit it
out so we can move on.

11:58.018 --> 12:01.853
[Letty] Okay, I was watching
the news and thinking
about human beings

12:01.855 --> 12:05.123
-and how we have behaved since
the beginning of civilized time.
-[Cassi scoffs]

12:05.125 --> 12:09.060
[Letty] And basically,
it seems to me, that we
haven't changed at all.

12:09.062 --> 12:12.997
The only things that
have truly evolved are
technologies and medicines.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.999
Just machinery and health.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.469
But, if you think about, I
don't know, any slice of time,

12:17.471 --> 12:21.172
any hundred to five hundred
year period over the past

12:22.008 --> 12:25.944
five thousand years,
the general patterns
would be the same:

12:25.946 --> 12:29.814
war over here; someone trying to
dominate the world over there;

12:30.117 --> 12:33.318
famine on this side; power
struggles over there

12:33.320 --> 12:36.821
and, most people just
going along with whatever
the times have to offer.

12:36.823 --> 12:40.825
It's almost as if it's human
nature to be this way,
as if it's in our DNAs.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.929
[Cassi]Yes, it -- most people
can be shoved into one
category or another;

12:44.931 --> 12:47.148
that's what makes
us so predictable.

12:47.149 --> 12:49.366
[Letty] Exactly. Which
lead me to thinking
about you and Oliver...

12:49.369 --> 12:51.035
[Cassi]And, there it is.

12:51.404 --> 12:54.005
[Letty] And, while he has
definitely stepped it up,

12:54.007 --> 12:55.840
been supportive,
committed, and loyal,

12:55.842 --> 12:58.877
ultimately, he's never stayed
in a relationship this long.

12:58.879 --> 13:03.348
[Cassi]So, my problems, the
things I've done to him, to us,

13:03.350 --> 13:06.417
are actually manifestation
of my own intuitions

13:06.419 --> 13:08.953
that he would ultimately
fail the relationship?

13:09.456 --> 13:13.158
[Letty] Sort of...
More like, hurt him
before he hurts you.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.460
I mean, I'm not saying
you don't have to own
your own fuck ups,

13:15.462 --> 13:19.030
but at least you can
understand them and
stop beating yourself up.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.198
[Cassi]I am what I am.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.133
[Letty] Exactly.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.568
[Cassi]So, I just have
to blame him?

13:24.504 --> 13:25.837
[Letty] You know what I mean.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.872
[Cassi]I do, but I think
it's inaccurate.

13:27.874 --> 13:30.241
[Letty] Oh, another thing I was
thinking of was statistics.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.433
[Cassi]Christ!

13:32.434 --> 13:33.956
[Letty] Well, you know
how people say,
"I quit drinking

13:33.957 --> 13:35.479
because I didn't want to
end up a statistic?"

13:35.482 --> 13:36.815
[Cassi]Yeah...?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.149
[Letty] Well, they're
still a statistic.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.483
They're just on the positive
side of the spectrum.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.052
You can't have a negative
without a positive.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.987
I never thought
about it that way.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.222
Yeah -- talk to Oliver.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.826
We're seeing each other tomorrow
to discuss the lease

13:47.828 --> 13:50.094
and whether or not
to renew, or break up.

13:50.096 --> 13:52.163
Well, good, at least you can
put your anxieties to bed.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.518
And, move on to second guessing.

13:56.519 --> 13:58.069
Okay, Cass, I know I say
a lot of stupid shit and
we fuck around a lot,

13:58.071 --> 13:59.304
but I'm worried about you.

14:00.106 --> 14:03.141
I know. Thank you. I love you.

14:03.143 --> 14:08.179
But this just needs time.
And, unfortunately,
I don't have any.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.553
[Max] Whatever
happened to Sarah?

14:15.555 --> 14:19.224
[Oliver] No idea. I stopped
talking to her five years ago,
when I moved in with Cassi.

14:19.226 --> 14:22.094
Yeah, yeah, I know, but why?

14:22.095 --> 14:24.963
Because, I told you, Cassi
doesn't trust any women
that I've been with...

14:25.432 --> 14:27.432
And, actually, a few
that I haven't been.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.367
So, what you're really saying
is, she doesn't trust you.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.369
No, you see, you just
don't get relationships.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.471
What's to get?
You meet an individual,

14:33.472 --> 14:35.572
you fall in love with them
because they are uniquely
different than you,

14:35.575 --> 14:37.609
then do your best to change them
into a variation of yourself

14:37.611 --> 14:40.211
until you resent each other
and you're fucking miserable.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.213
So maybe you do
get relationships.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.214
Anyway, I wasn't asking
why you didn't remain
friends with Sarah

14:44.217 --> 14:45.767
after getting together
with Cassi,

14:45.768 --> 14:47.318
I was wondering why
you originally stopped
talking with her?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.587
And I thought, also,
that she cheated on you.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.556
No, no, see, not physically.

14:51.558 --> 14:55.526
Or, she wouldn't admit to it,
but, you know, other stuff.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.095
-Uh-huh...
-You see.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.430
This is becoming your pattern.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.266
Okay, I don't want
to talk about it.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.101
Oh, come on dude, you really
gotta learn to compartmentalize.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.937
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
says the guy whose
strongest personality trait

15:05.939 --> 15:07.538
is most aligned with that
of a sociopath's...

15:07.540 --> 15:09.290
Well, if you want
to be accurate,

15:09.291 --> 15:11.041
it's more closely aligned with
that of a psychotic's, but...

15:11.044 --> 15:14.012
-Oh, apologies--
-I think I'm gonna
try to fuck that barista.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.014
And, I take that apology back.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.582
No, no, I'm serious man.
She's something else.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.485
-Who, Janie?
-Is that her name?

15:20.487 --> 15:22.186
-The woman
who just served us?
-Yeah.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.354
Yes. Janie.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.123
Really? I thought it was Pamela.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.259
It's not. And, please,
don't hook up with Janie.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.429
You know I can't
promise you that.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.598
God, please don't. Look -- she
knows we're friends, okay?
She sees me every morning.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.466
So what?

15:35.468 --> 15:37.936
So, you're gonna screw
things up and I'm gonna have
to find a new coffee shop

15:37.937 --> 15:40.405
just like I had to find
a new taco stand last year.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.207
I did you a fucking favor, dude.
Those tacos were garbage!

15:43.209 --> 15:45.243
And, besides, there's like,
uh, thirty- five coffee shops

15:45.245 --> 15:46.411
in a twelve-block radius
of your apartment.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.680
Seven of which alone
are Starbucks.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.948
Okay, look, look, look, look.
Let me just put it to you
this way, alright?

15:50.951 --> 15:53.117
They know me there,
alright? I like it.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.119
-Uh-huh.
-They give me free coffees,

15:55.121 --> 15:58.056
and I like it, and it's
comfortable, okay?

15:58.058 --> 16:01.426
-So -- so what,
that makes Jenny off limits?
-Oh my God, it's Janie!

16:01.428 --> 16:05.330
Dude, it could be fucking
Marsha for all I care -- I don't
care, she's fucking hot!

16:05.332 --> 16:07.999
Oh, oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah...

16:08.000 --> 16:10.667
That's right, see. Why do you
feel the need to put your dick
in every pretty girl you meet?

16:10.670 --> 16:12.670
Dude, it's not just pretty
girls, I don't discriminate...

16:12.672 --> 16:15.239
I go after whoever turns me on
-- whoever turns me on...

16:15.241 --> 16:18.409
You remember that, uh,
big girl Samara with the
funny face and the fat rolls?

16:18.411 --> 16:20.728
-Yeah, yeah, fat Samara.
-Fat Samara...

16:20.729 --> 16:23.046
I used to take Vaseline,
put it on her back fat
and fold it around my--

16:23.049 --> 16:25.783
Okay! Alright.

16:25.784 --> 16:28.518
I get the point, alright?
Now just, please, stay
away from Janine.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.389
Okay.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.323
I see.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.343
What? See what?

16:35.344 --> 16:38.362
Oh-kay. You know your futile
attempt to dissuade me now
made complete fucking sense.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.099
You got a crush on Janet.

16:41.101 --> 16:44.535
Oh my god, it's Janie!

16:44.537 --> 16:47.205
Not Janet,
not Janine, not Jenny...

16:47.207 --> 16:49.174
Janie!

16:49.175 --> 16:51.142
You're like in love
with this chick, bro.

16:51.143 --> 16:53.110
Oh, my fucking -- would you just
-- you're fucking doing this to
make me crazy. It's, I--

16:53.113 --> 16:55.413
-I'm-- I-- Fuck!
-Why can't you
just be honest?

16:55.782 --> 16:57.215
-No more!
-Just be honest!

16:57.217 --> 16:59.083
-No more--
-Hey, I'll stay away.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.221
[Letty] I had computer sex
with Zane yesterday.

17:03.223 --> 17:08.426
[Cassi] What? Letty,
come on. I thought you
said he had a girlfriend.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.794
[Letty] What? It's not cheating.

17:09.796 --> 17:14.465
What are you mean?
Of course it's cheating. He
had sex with another person.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.435
Cybersex. There's a difference.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.670
I don't think his girlfriend
would see it that way.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.607
Well, lucky for me I don't give
a shit about his girlfriend.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.542
Not cool.

17:24.544 --> 17:28.679
But, regardless, why are
you even communicating
at all with that asshole?

17:28.681 --> 17:30.681
You mean, that sexy asshole?

17:31.184 --> 17:32.350
He's a jerk!

17:32.352 --> 17:34.385
Yeah, with a big dick!

17:35.388 --> 17:38.456
Why does it always come down
to penis size with you?

17:38.458 --> 17:41.426
Because that's what I like.

17:41.427 --> 17:44.395
I mean, you prefer soft cuddles
and wooing whispers,
and I like a big cock.

17:44.397 --> 17:49.233
And, I'm not talking about
a generally large penis.
His dick is anaconda huge.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.637
In fact, once when we were
stoned and fucking around,

17:52.639 --> 17:54.839
he pretended his dick
was a boa constrictor

17:54.841 --> 17:57.475
and wrapped it clear
around the cat's neck.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.211
Oh, my god!

18:00.747 --> 18:05.349
Yeah. It was funny until
the cat got scared and dug
its claws into the shaft.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.720
You know, you don't know
how much blood is flowing
through one of those things

18:09.722 --> 18:13.758
until you see ten little
puncture wounds pulsating
to the beat of a man's heart.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.245
Letty!

18:17.246 --> 18:18.295
What? It's really,
really, really big.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.865
Okay. I get it. I get it.

18:22.735 --> 18:27.371
And, I might add, it's just
cybersex. I mean, Oliver
masturbates to porn.

18:27.674 --> 18:31.342
And, that bothers me for a
whole slew of other reasons,

18:31.344 --> 18:33.744
but this is totally different
and you know it.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.514
Why, because I'm a real person?

18:37.417 --> 18:40.818
No, because he knows
you. And, because
he's your fucking ex!

18:40.820 --> 18:44.072
And, because it's just wrong.

18:44.073 --> 18:47.325
Wha-- why does-- why does --
why is it wrong? Why does it
have to be an issue of morality?

18:47.327 --> 18:49.427
Well, if it's not wrong,
then why doesn't he
tell his girlfriend?

18:49.829 --> 18:52.230
Because she'd freak
out and be insecure.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.832
Yeah, and she'd leave
him and hate you.

18:54.834 --> 18:59.203
Well, I don't give a shit if
she'd hate me, and I
don't think she'd leave.

19:00.273 --> 19:05.343
Well, you should give a shit.
And you told me that it wasn't
even technically a relationship

19:05.345 --> 19:08.346
when you were together,
that you were free
to date other people.

19:08.848 --> 19:11.682
Yeah, that I was free to date
other people, not Zane.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.918
And, Zane was okay with that?

19:17.557 --> 19:19.624
Why would I have
ever told him that?

19:19.625 --> 19:21.692
Oh, how could I have
forgotten? You have that
don't ask don't tell policy.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.495
I might add that if you
had the same policy,

19:24.497 --> 19:26.631
you and Oliver wouldn't be
in this pickle you're in.

19:27.600 --> 19:32.837
Okay, first of all, I didn't
fuck Charlie, we only shared
a few innocent kisses.

19:34.641 --> 19:38.376
Cass, if you're going
to lie, don't do it to me.

19:38.711 --> 19:39.777
I'm not lying.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.381
You told me
Charlie fingered you.

19:43.383 --> 19:47.552
Even by my standards
that's a tad more intimate
than a few innocent kisses.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.288
Okay, can you please--
Don't remind me.

19:50.290 --> 19:54.358
I have nothing but shame
and remorse for my
actions those evenings.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.427
Well, that's why
you're in a pickle.

19:56.930 --> 19:58.696
Well, if the only reason
I wasn't in a pickle

19:58.698 --> 20:00.831
was because I was sleeping
with whoever I wanted to,

20:00.833 --> 20:03.668
behind my partners back,
then I'd be in a whole
other pickle.

20:04.337 --> 20:08.673
And, Oliver didn't find out
because I told him, he found out
because he found evidence.

20:08.675 --> 20:11.909
And, more importantly, I don't
want to be in a relationship

20:11.911 --> 20:14.745
with someone I don't wholly want
to be in a relationship with.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.615
Okay then, you don't
want to be with Oliver?

20:18.318 --> 20:20.618
That's not what I'm saying.
You're twisting my words.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.321
I'm talking about your actions.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.691
-Yes, I fucked up!
-More than once.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.227
Yes, okay, so I'm not
perfect. We know this.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.329
But, you're too
hard on yourself.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.630
And, you're too easy.

20:33.466 --> 20:34.732
Said the girl in a pickle.

20:34.734 --> 20:39.837
You-- you can't go
through life not taking
responsibility for your actions,

20:39.839 --> 20:41.706
especially when
they hurt someone.

20:44.611 --> 20:48.012
I don't care. I don't
really give a shit about
what people think, I mean,

20:48.014 --> 20:50.815
I just do whatever I want,
and I don't give a shit
about consequences.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.817
Okay, well, that's the
crux of your issues.

20:52.819 --> 20:56.454
And I promise you,
if Zane's girlfriend knew,
she would leave him.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.888
Yeah, that's why
he doesn't tell her.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.858
You've gotta stop this.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.995
It's fucking Zane and some
twat he met on Tinder.

21:03.997 --> 21:07.598
Yeah, well you don't know this
twat, and she probably didn't
know you were together

21:07.600 --> 21:10.968
when she met him, and she
could be a very nice person.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.437
Then I'd be doing her a favor.

21:14.307 --> 21:18.976
Letty, do you understand how
backwards that thinking is?

21:20.713 --> 21:23.064
I mean--

21:23.065 --> 21:25.416
Okay, not that
I should be lecturing
anyone on relationships.

21:25.418 --> 21:28.352
I'm aware of the hypocrisy.

21:28.988 --> 21:33.024
It's always easy to see other
people's problems. It's what
informs us to work on ourselves.

21:33.026 --> 21:35.626
We are but mirrors
to one another's flaws.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.562
Did Guru Dan tell you that?

21:39.299 --> 21:41.499
No, I quit that class
a month ago.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.567
Wait, you never told me that.

21:43.569 --> 21:48.039
Yeah, I saw Guru Dan
feeling some twenty-one-
year old's perfect tits

21:48.041 --> 21:50.308
while repositioning her.

21:50.310 --> 21:51.842
What a pervert.

21:51.844 --> 21:56.013
I'd agree, but I think
just deep down I was
jealous he never did that to me.

21:56.616 --> 21:59.050
-Letty.
-What? It's true.

22:00.453 --> 22:01.719
Well that explains the cybersex.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.789
Yeah? So what explains
the fingering?

22:06.659 --> 22:08.092
Okay, can we...

22:08.861 --> 22:10.061
Can we just walk on?

22:11.464 --> 22:12.897
[Cassi sighs]

22:17.970 --> 22:20.071
[Oliver] Never trust anyone
who quotes the Bible.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.273
[Max] Like a politician?

22:22.274 --> 22:24.474
[Oliver] No, never trust
a politician, period.
But never trust anyone:

22:24.477 --> 22:26.510
teachers, advisers,
your parents,

22:26.512 --> 22:28.979
anyone who quotes anything
even biblical in nature.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.332
[Max] New Testament or Old?

22:31.333 --> 22:33.684
[Oliver] Any testament,
any sect-- it doesn't
even matter what religion.

22:33.686 --> 22:37.588
You're better off taking
advice from someone who
quotes<i> Alice in Wonderland</i>

22:37.590 --> 22:38.756
or "Hop On Pop."

22:38.758 --> 22:39.924
[Max] Is this what went
wrong with Marie?

22:39.926 --> 22:43.094
[Oliver] Why do you feel the
need to go over every one
of my failed relationships

22:43.096 --> 22:45.113
each time I'm struggling
in my current one?

22:45.114 --> 22:47.131
[Max] I'm just trying
to see where it all goes
wrong with my friend.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.966
[Oliver] It doesn't
all go wrong.

22:48.968 --> 22:51.936
Relationships are tricky.
In the case of Marie,

22:51.938 --> 22:54.605
it did have to do with
religious differences.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.073
[Max] So she didn't want
to be with an atheist?

22:56.075 --> 22:57.708
[Oliver] It was more
because of the kid.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.810
[Max] What kid? You guys
talked about having kids?

22:59.812 --> 23:01.879
[Oliver] I must have told you
I accidentally got her pregnant.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.182
[Max] No, you didn't.

23:04.183 --> 23:06.484
[Oliver] Yeah, well, it led
to us discussing how this
child would be raised

23:06.486 --> 23:08.536
and I made it abundantly clear,

23:08.537 --> 23:10.587
no kid of mine would
ever be brainwashed
with religious jargon,

23:10.590 --> 23:13.424
and especially not that
of the gospel variety.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.025
[Max] Oooff, she took
offense to this?

23:15.027 --> 23:16.127
[Oliver] To say the least.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.028
[Max] So what happened,
she miscarried?

23:18.030 --> 23:19.764
[Oliver] No, she
had an abortion.

23:19.765 --> 23:21.499
Wait, didn't we just
established the fact
she was Christian?

23:21.501 --> 23:23.985
Max, don't be so naive.

23:23.986 --> 23:26.470
I mean, you know religious
people today are like
bakers making cookies:

23:26.472 --> 23:28.973
If they don't like an ingredient
they just take it out.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.792
You must have been freaking out.

23:30.793 --> 23:32.610
Yeah, well, sadly, I had
been through that before.

23:33.513 --> 23:34.612
You got someone else pregnant?

23:34.914 --> 23:36.697
Three other people.

23:36.698 --> 23:38.481
-Three others people?
So, four total?
-Yeah.

23:38.484 --> 23:43.187
I was really young, stupid
and naive, and irresponsible
in my early twenties.

23:43.189 --> 23:46.991
[Max] I thought I got a chick
pregnant once. Turns out
she was just constipated,

23:46.993 --> 23:49.627
had to take a huge shit.
But, for like two days, I
was freaking the fuck out!

23:49.629 --> 23:52.496
Look, her turd ended
up being so massive,
we actually named it.

23:52.498 --> 23:55.065
Listen, I don't want
to hear about your
girlfriend's shit. Okay?

23:55.067 --> 23:57.601
-[Max] So, what, do
you want to have a kid?
-[Oliver] I-- I mean...

23:57.603 --> 24:01.972
It is something that Cassi and
I have discussed, but, we gotta
see what comes of us first.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.707
[Max] But, do you
really want one?

24:03.709 --> 24:05.409
[Oliver] I don't know,
most of the time.

24:05.410 --> 24:07.110
I mean, I have to have
someone to leave my stuff to.

24:07.113 --> 24:10.181
-[Max] Your stuff?
-[Oliver] My money,
or whatever I have.

24:10.183 --> 24:13.751
[Max scoffs] Fuck.
Listen, Oliver. I'm fucked
up, okay? I admit it.

24:13.753 --> 24:18.222
Okay, I got very dark thoughts
about life, love, sexuality.
I'm a masochist, a misogynist.

24:18.224 --> 24:21.926
I'm a flender. I'm pretty
much the last person
to take real advice from,

24:21.928 --> 24:24.695
and to tell you the
truth, I think kids
are fucking disgusting.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.964
But trust me when I tell
you that to have a child

24:26.966 --> 24:29.133
just to have someone
to leave your shit to
who isn't a stranger

24:29.135 --> 24:31.636
-is gonna be severely
damaging this child.
-No.

24:31.637 --> 24:34.138
You're not, look...
I don't just wanna have
a kid to leave my stuff to,

24:34.140 --> 24:37.107
I'm looking for meaning
in my life, you know, a reason
to wake up every day.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.743
And, besides, Cassi wants
to have a child eventually.

24:39.745 --> 24:41.228
That's fucked up.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.712
No, that's the reason
people have kids;

24:42.715 --> 24:45.015
to give their otherwise
sad little lives
meaning and purpose.

24:45.017 --> 24:49.186
I mean, do you think if anybody
took five minutes to think
about the future ramifications

24:49.188 --> 24:52.823
that their child will one day
have to deal with, anybody
would ever procreate?

24:52.825 --> 24:55.125
I mean, is this your argument
for having a kid or
for not having one?

24:55.127 --> 24:58.646
Okay, look, uh.

24:58.647 --> 25:02.166
What I'm saying is that
having a child seems to change
people's perspectives on lives.

25:02.802 --> 25:05.803
And, maybe it's about time
that I changed mine.
That's all, you know?

25:05.805 --> 25:07.021
Okay.

25:07.022 --> 25:08.238
-[Oliver] Anyway...
-[Max] Alright.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.579
[Letty] I told you I had
an abortion once, yeah?

25:16.749 --> 25:20.518
It was the worst.
Not the physical pain,
just the emotional pain;

25:20.520 --> 25:22.920
and, the disappointing stares
from my grandparents.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.555
[Cassi] I can't even imagine.

25:24.557 --> 25:25.756
[Letty] Yeah.

25:25.758 --> 25:32.229
Oh! Did I tell you I was
uptown and I saw April
Menlow's name on a building?

25:32.231 --> 25:34.598
[Cassi] Wait, she's already
donating buildings?

25:34.600 --> 25:37.701
[Letty] Yeah. It's as
if she thinks it'll bring
her parents back.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.237
[Cassi] I'm pretty sure
people do that for
their children's sake,

25:40.239 --> 25:42.890
not to bring back their
deceased parents.

25:42.891 --> 25:45.542
[Letty] No. Uh-uh.
They do it because they're
self-important pricks.

25:46.078 --> 25:48.746
You can't call everyone who
donates a building a prick.

25:48.748 --> 25:51.582
A lot of them are
honored posthumously

25:51.584 --> 25:53.284
and, for the most part, they're
very important buildings.

25:53.286 --> 25:56.320
Yeah, well, I'd be
too embarrassed to
have my name on one.

25:57.623 --> 26:02.593
Wait, that would be
embarrassing? Out of all the
things you've done in public,

26:02.595 --> 26:04.929
having your name on a building
would be embarrassing?

26:05.231 --> 26:09.233
Yeah I mean, I definitely
don't give a shit about
leaving a legacy behind.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.602
I mean, you're here
and then you're gone,

26:11.604 --> 26:14.605
and no amount of buildings
with your name on it
makes you immortal.

26:15.641 --> 26:17.675
I never realized you gave
the subject so much thought.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.677
Yeah, well, I think
about lots of shit.

26:21.047 --> 26:24.582
Hey, did I ever tell you that
in high school I was voted

26:24.584 --> 26:27.051
least likely to become
President?

26:27.787 --> 26:30.287
Okay, a bit of a
non-sequitur, but I'll bite.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.723
Why did your school even
have that option available?

26:33.225 --> 26:35.893
I don't know. It's better than
what Joey Federini was voted:

26:35.895 --> 26:40.130
Most likely to suffer from
premature erectile dysfunction.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.767
What the hell was wrong
with your school yearbook?

26:43.769 --> 26:48.339
It wasn't the official school
yearbook, it was an off
campus, underground weekly

26:48.341 --> 26:53.010
that usually concentrated
its efforts on destroying the
carefully guarded reputations

26:53.012 --> 26:59.316
of mean teachers who also
happened to be closeted
alcoholics or homosexuals.

27:00.386 --> 27:04.922
I thought it was
hilarious back then,
but now I'm not so sure.

27:05.992 --> 27:10.628
Two different teachers
resigned after one
particularly harsh issue.

27:10.630 --> 27:13.197
One of them sued the school and
the other tried to kill himself.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.932
Jesus! What was in it?

27:14.934 --> 27:18.736
Just your run of the mill,
semi- warranted, immature
assaults on their character.

27:18.738 --> 27:23.941
And, a bunch of pictures of
teachers with the word "cunt"
written on their foreheads.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.244
Still, that doesn't
sound like suicide bait.

27:27.246 --> 27:30.848
Oh, no, the teacher who tried
to kill himself, Mr. Dobbs,

27:31.217 --> 27:34.652
-was caught in his car during
school hours, masturbating.
-Oh!

27:35.321 --> 27:36.987
What a creep!

27:36.989 --> 27:38.088
I don't know.

27:38.090 --> 27:42.426
It just... it just made me feel
sad for him, and lonely...

27:44.130 --> 27:48.232
Anyways, that was the first year
I fucked my English teacher.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.902
[Cassi] And it just keeps
on unraveling itself.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.206
[Letty] I celebrated eight
years sober on Monday.

27:56.208 --> 28:01.011
Letty! That's amazing! Why
didn't you lead with that?

28:01.013 --> 28:03.047
Oh, you know
how I feel about it.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.683
Ugh! You should be
proud of yourself.

28:05.685 --> 28:10.354
No, trust me, I'm beyond
grateful to be sober, I just
feel like -- I don't know,

28:10.356 --> 28:12.790
I just feel like an addict
celebrating getting
sober would be like

28:12.792 --> 28:17.094
if an arsonist celebrating
escaping from a burning
building that he set on fire.

28:17.096 --> 28:20.831
No way. It's really awesome!
Lunch is on me today.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.950
No, please, let me buy.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.068
It reminds me that I only
have money because
I'm not strung out.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.704
Then I'm buying
you dessert later.

28:27.907 --> 28:30.174
Wow, well you know
my weakness. [laughs]

28:30.176 --> 28:32.910
[Cassi] Really, desserts? I
thought it was large phalluses.

28:32.912 --> 28:36.814
[Letty] Oh, well, what
I wouldn't do for a large,
chocolate cock right now!

28:38.017 --> 28:40.184
[Cassi] I have only myself
to blame for that.

28:40.186 --> 28:44.221
[Letty] They're so tasty!
And the balls are made
from Cadbury cream eggs.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.790
[Cassi] Okay, now
you're just showing off.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.729
-But, do they really
taste like that?
-[Letty] Uh-huh.

28:51.731 --> 28:53.230
[both laughing]

28:53.232 --> 28:57.501
[Max] You ever try to
last when jerking off to
some really good shit,

28:57.503 --> 28:59.970
as if it's a real person
in the room and you're
trying to impress them?

29:00.406 --> 29:03.307
[Oliver] No. When I masturbate,
I just want the end result.

29:03.309 --> 29:05.509
[Max] Oh, you gotta
practice your edging, bro.

29:05.511 --> 29:08.779
-[Oliver] My what?
-[Max] Your edging. It's like,
trying to control your pop.

29:08.781 --> 29:11.949
[Oliver] Okay. I can control
my pop just fine, thank you.

29:11.951 --> 29:15.052
[Max] Uh-huh. Forget it, man,
you wouldn't understand.
It's a Tantric thing.

29:15.054 --> 29:18.856
Oh, what -- you're suddenly
some kind of Kama Sutra,
sex master?

29:18.858 --> 29:20.524
Did you see the girl
I was talking to last night?

29:20.526 --> 29:22.710
Are we still talking
about the same thing?

29:22.711 --> 29:24.895
Now just stop trying
to beholden me to
your oppressive, linear values.

29:25.331 --> 29:27.765
Okay, I don't know
what the fuck you're
talking about anymore.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.200
Just answer the question: did
you see the girl I was talking
to last night? Yes or no?

29:30.202 --> 29:33.303
I did see the girl.
She sat with us
for forty-five minutes.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.304
And what did you think?

29:34.306 --> 29:39.009
I don't know, I didn't talk
to her. She was pretty.

29:39.011 --> 29:42.546
-That's it?
-Are you trying to get me
to ask you what happened?

29:42.548 --> 29:44.982
-What do you mean
what happened?
-Oh, my god.

29:44.984 --> 29:49.052
Yes, I walked her home.
No, I didn't fuck her.

29:49.054 --> 29:52.156
But I did make out with her,
and believe me,
I'm gonna fuck her soon.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.391
Oh, great. Sounds good.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.627
You know what?

29:56.628 --> 29:58.161
Being in a relationship
for the past five years

29:58.164 --> 30:00.297
has made you forget
what it's like out there
for the rest of us.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.934
No, I'm just not interested
in every single one
of your exploits.

30:03.936 --> 30:06.136
Don't be a snob.
I'm your best friend

30:06.138 --> 30:07.571
and I'm just telling you
about a beautiful woman

30:07.573 --> 30:09.373
that I'm going to put my
erect penis into one day.

30:09.375 --> 30:12.293
Oh, well, we all
have to have goals.

30:12.294 --> 30:15.212
Yeah, well you judge now, but
if you and Cassi do break up,
you're gonna see what it's like.

30:15.214 --> 30:18.215
Yeah. You know, can we
talk about something
a tad more serious?

30:18.217 --> 30:20.884
Like what? Those tiny little
indie films you love so much?

30:20.886 --> 30:22.386
-With the no budgets
and no names?
-Yeah.

30:22.388 --> 30:26.924
I like them because
they're the purest films
in cinema today.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.927
Don't you think that's just
like a slight exaggeration?

30:29.929 --> 30:34.364
No, no. I think as soon
as too much of somebody
else's money gets involved,

30:34.366 --> 30:37.034
or too many names, out goes
the pure vision of the director.

30:37.036 --> 30:39.269
And, I think it's imperative
that any filmmaker

30:39.271 --> 30:41.872
tries to expunge as many
outside opinions as possible.

30:41.874 --> 30:44.692
Yeah, along with the audience.

30:44.693 --> 30:47.511
Yeah. Don't get me started on
filmmakers who make films with
an audience's concerns in mind.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.847
You know, some people do
make films with the hopes

30:49.849 --> 30:52.382
that someone other
than themselves are going
to see it eventually.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.518
Okay, you know what?
Let's not talk about films.

30:54.520 --> 30:58.322
What about people you've seen?
Have you ran
into anybody lately,

30:58.324 --> 31:01.792
had any interesting
conversations?

31:01.793 --> 31:05.261
I pretty much only talk to you,
women I'm sleeping with, and
women I'm trying to sleep with.

31:05.264 --> 31:08.932
Okay, my bad...
Uh, what about books
you've read recently?

31:08.934 --> 31:11.068
I told you, uh, I quit
reading books years ago.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.269
I thought that was a joke.

31:12.271 --> 31:13.904
Why would I joke about that?

31:13.906 --> 31:16.106
Why would you stop
reading books?

31:16.108 --> 31:19.076
Uh, I think I -- you
know -- I thought I read, pretty
much everything I cared to read

31:19.078 --> 31:21.979
that would have been made
available during the lives
of my favorite authors,

31:21.981 --> 31:24.047
and I'm just not interested
in contemporary authors.

31:24.049 --> 31:29.286
Yeah, another whackadoo
theory by Max the Great!
I mean, this is absurd!

31:29.288 --> 31:34.358
Do you-- There's tons of--
brilliant, contemporary
authors out there today.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.944
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

31:36.945 --> 31:39.529
-Well, I don't give a fuck!
-Oh my god, it's like
you're allergic to culture.

31:39.531 --> 31:42.232
No. I just don't waste time
with all that bullshit.

31:42.234 --> 31:46.904
Oh, no, no, no, that's right--
playing Grand Theft Auto
is far more important.

31:46.906 --> 31:50.374
No, I don't think either's
more important, but, GTA
is certainly more entertaining.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.511
It's rotting your brain.

31:54.513 --> 31:59.316
[scoffs] Listen, Oliver-- look.
I've been smoking pot every day
since I was eleven years old.

31:59.318 --> 32:04.254
Okay? I enjoy drinking,
Xanax, a little Xbox, and
a little butthole play, okay?

32:04.256 --> 32:06.490
I'm not exactly concerned
about my brain.

32:06.492 --> 32:09.259
And don't you should be
focusing a little bit more
on your problems with Cassi

32:09.261 --> 32:11.061
than worrying about
my lifestyle choices?

32:14.300 --> 32:18.368
Holy shit, bro. I have
never seen you speechless.

32:20.005 --> 32:22.673
-Okay, you know
what? Fuck you! Again.
-[laughs]

32:26.512 --> 32:28.312
[Cassi] Yeah, you do have, like,
a little something in there.

32:28.314 --> 32:30.281
[Letty] Are you serious?

32:30.282 --> 32:32.249
[Cassi] Yeah. I don't know --
looks like spinach, or -- what
did you have for breakfast?

32:32.952 --> 32:33.684
[Letty] What do I do?

32:33.686 --> 32:38.188
[Cassi] Take the spit
and, like, swish it through
your two front teeth.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.490
-Yeah, like that.
-[Letty] Is it gone?

32:41.060 --> 32:42.492
-[Cassi] Yeah. You're good.
-[Letty] Okay.

32:43.195 --> 32:45.195
-Ah, gross.
-[Cassi] It wasn't bad.

32:45.196 --> 32:47.196
-[Letty] Cass--
-[Cassi] If I saw it before
I would have said something.

32:47.199 --> 32:48.498
[Letty] That's so embarrassing.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.285
[Cassi] It's fine.

32:51.286 --> 32:54.071
[Letty] Yeah-- talking to
people, and you're like, hey!
[laughs] This big green thing.

32:54.073 --> 32:56.273
You're beautiful no matter
what's in your teeth.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.175
Oh, well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

33:00.012 --> 33:03.981
[Cassi] I think -- I like
the female power thing.
I like, like, the...

33:03.983 --> 33:06.316
the female-centric stories
now. You know.

33:06.618 --> 33:07.617
[Letty] Yeah.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.588
I mean, I agree, but...

33:13.359 --> 33:15.209
-I don't know.
-[Cassi] But what?

33:15.210 --> 33:17.060
[Letty] I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

33:17.062 --> 33:19.396
To be honest, I fell asleep
for like twenty minutes.

33:19.398 --> 33:22.299
[Cassi] Oh my god, you
do that every time.

33:22.301 --> 33:24.034
-[Letty] No, I don't, do I--
-[Cassi] Yes you do!

33:24.036 --> 33:25.469
Every time I go see
a movie with you...

33:25.771 --> 33:28.172
-[Letty laughing]
-[Cassi] You fall asleep.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.574
And there's always,
like-- inevitably there's
always, like, popcorn--

33:30.576 --> 33:33.076
-[Letty] Right.
-[Cassi] That has spilled all
over you because you drop it.

33:33.078 --> 33:35.429
[Letty laughs]

33:35.430 --> 33:37.781
Maybe I just need to do, lot's
of-- Popcorn makes me so gassy.

33:37.783 --> 33:38.749
[Cassi] Yeah, I know.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.026
[street noises, children
screaming, people chatting]

34:27.066 --> 34:28.432
[loud crash]

34:44.483 --> 34:47.818
[cars honking]

35:00.833 --> 35:03.300
[Letty] Do you ever prolong your
orgasm when masturbating?

35:03.302 --> 35:07.337
[Cassi] Why do you have
to ask me stuff like that?
You know it embarrasses me.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.840
[Letty] Yeah, that's why
I ask you. It's so fun
to watch you squirm.

35:09.842 --> 35:10.807
[Cassi] So much.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.960
[Letty] What?

35:12.961 --> 35:15.112
[Cassi] It's "so much fun," or
"such fun," but not "so fun."

35:15.114 --> 35:17.380
[Letty] Oh, don't do that,
It's really frustrating.

35:17.382 --> 35:19.382
My grandfather used
to correct me all the time.

35:20.185 --> 35:23.720
[Cassi] Holy shit!
Did I just accidentally
stumble upon the one thing

35:23.722 --> 35:26.256
that makes Letty
squeamish in public?

35:26.258 --> 35:28.258
-[Letty] Okay, back
to you and Oliver.
-[Cassi laughs]

35:28.260 --> 35:30.027
[Letty] If you want
my uncut advice,

35:30.028 --> 35:31.795
I think you should pack it in,
call it a day and move on.

35:33.232 --> 35:36.299
[Cassi] This isn't an auto
loan I'm considering,
this is my life.

35:36.301 --> 35:39.870
[Letty] Stay single, focus
on your career while
you're still young enough.

35:39.872 --> 35:41.671
[Cassi] My career
isn't the problem.

35:42.341 --> 35:44.207
[Letty] No, your daydreaming is.

35:44.209 --> 35:45.308
[Cassi] In what way?

35:45.310 --> 35:49.379
[Letty] In the way that it's
exactly what drove you to go get
finger-popped by an old flame,

35:49.381 --> 35:51.148
when things got
tough with Oliver.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.916
-[Cassi] Really? Finger popped?
-[Letty] Yeah.

35:52.918 --> 35:55.185
And, had you been single, that
wouldn't have been an issue.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.354
[Cassi] I don't like
being single.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.289
[Letty] No, you don't
like being alone.

35:59.291 --> 36:02.592
-There's a difference.
-[Cassi] You're wrong.
I enjoy my alone time,

36:02.594 --> 36:04.194
when I'm in a relationship.

36:04.530 --> 36:07.164
It's nice knowing
that it's temporary.

36:07.533 --> 36:10.433
[Letty] Everything is temporary.
My arm is temporary.

36:10.903 --> 36:11.902
[Cassi] Okay.

36:11.904 --> 36:14.371
[Letty] There's nothing
more isolating

36:14.372 --> 36:16.839
than sleeping next to a person
you feel estranged from.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.875
[Cassi] I never said
I felt estranged.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.378
[Letty] Okay, disconnected.

36:21.914 --> 36:25.282
[Cassi] Disconnections come and
go. It's about communication.

36:25.751 --> 36:28.318
[Letty] But you always say
that Oliver wants space.

36:28.720 --> 36:32.522
[Cassi] That has to more to do
with my own fear and insecurity
that he wants to leave me.

36:32.524 --> 36:36.259
Not my annoyance with
the fact that he needs solitude
in order to do his work.

36:36.261 --> 36:38.495
[Letty] Hmm.
I prefer what I have.

36:38.497 --> 36:41.798
I see someone I want
to be with and I'm with
them. As simple as that.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.301
[Cassi] No, except,
you're never actually with them.

36:44.303 --> 36:45.702
Which is why, no
matter who you choose,

36:45.704 --> 36:48.505
you will never actually
experience true intimacy.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.541
[Letty] What I do is
the definition of intimate.

36:51.877 --> 36:54.411
[Cassi] No, what you do is
the definition of uninhibited,

36:54.413 --> 36:56.646
promiscuous even,
but not intimacy.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.248
-[Letty] I disagree--
-[Cassi] In fact, one could,

36:58.250 --> 37:00.650
one could argue that it's
the antithesis of intimacy.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.385
[Letty] I disagree.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.955
I think the only thing that
matters is in the moment,

37:04.957 --> 37:07.290
and in the moment
of sexual collision,

37:07.292 --> 37:10.293
the only thing that exists is
me and the person I'm with,

37:10.295 --> 37:13.263
and that moment is the most
intimate moment possible.

37:13.765 --> 37:16.800
If anything, couples hide
behind the delusion of safety,

37:16.802 --> 37:20.670
thinking that equates to
intimacy and meaning, when
really it's just a smokescreen

37:20.672 --> 37:22.739
from having to look at
yourselves honestly and clearly.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.508
[Cassi] Wow, you're
really fucked up.

37:25.510 --> 37:26.776
[Letty] Agree to disagree.

37:26.778 --> 37:29.546
[Cassi] Letty, please,
talk to a professional
about that theory.

37:29.548 --> 37:30.747
[Letty] You talk
to a professional.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.315
[Cassi] I do. Twice a week.

37:32.317 --> 37:34.868
[Letty] And, look
where it's gotten you.

37:34.869 --> 37:37.420
[Cassi] I'm here because
relationships are imperfect
and because I fucked up.

37:38.323 --> 37:39.789
[Letty] So why be in it?

37:39.791 --> 37:43.693
Because, they're also
some of the most beautiful
expressions of love,

37:43.695 --> 37:46.596
and with some work,
and a lot of faith,

37:46.598 --> 37:48.932
you can experience
something better than any drug

37:48.934 --> 37:51.801
or momentary, sexual
encounter has to offer.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.571
[Letty] Okay, then you
know what you wanna do.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.273
[Cassi] I wish it
were that easy.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.408
[Letty] Well, why isn't it?

37:58.410 --> 38:03.413
[Cassi] I don't know.
Can we just, keep
walking in silence, please?

38:07.319 --> 38:09.052
[street noises]

38:42.421 --> 38:44.921
[Max] What do you think it
is about younger women
make 'em so attractive?

38:44.923 --> 38:46.656
[Oliver] Can we not
do this right now, Max?

38:46.658 --> 38:48.091
What, are you too
mature to answer that?

38:48.093 --> 38:50.427
No, I'm just not obsessed
with sex the way you are.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.862
Every man is a obsessed with
sex; some just don't admit it.

38:52.864 --> 38:55.382
Oh, yeah -- well, you
have no problem there.

38:55.383 --> 38:57.901
Fuck no! I own that shit!
I know what I like and I
say it to the fucking world.

38:58.704 --> 39:01.071
You know, admission
doesn't always equal honesty.

39:01.073 --> 39:03.957
No, but it does equal intimacy.

39:03.958 --> 39:06.842
No, not when the truth
of the admission is being
used as a smokescreen.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.646
You're really not going
to discuss why younger
women are so hot, are you?

39:09.981 --> 39:13.583
Okay, what's to discuss? They
have softer, smoother skin,

39:13.585 --> 39:15.752
they aren't worried
about careers or portfolios,

39:15.754 --> 39:18.789
they not hung up on
marriage and children,

39:18.790 --> 39:21.825
they have a naive innocence
and their skin smells like
fresh, blossoming flowers.

39:21.827 --> 39:22.992
I mean, what do you wanna hear?

39:23.995 --> 39:24.861
Wow!

39:24.863 --> 39:28.598
I just wanted to discuss
why men, in general, find
younger women attractive,

39:28.600 --> 39:32.001
and, but you, you've really
given this a lot of thought.

39:32.604 --> 39:34.037
You're a real fucking sicko.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.639
Okay, you know what?
Go fuck yourself.

39:37.442 --> 39:38.475
Come on! Eh...

39:39.111 --> 39:41.444
I'm joking! I'm just kidding!

39:41.446 --> 39:43.947
I agree, they smell
like flowers!

39:49.855 --> 39:51.788
I would never date
a younger guy.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.757
Don't be so turned off.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.458
I just don't see the appeal.

39:55.994 --> 39:59.062
The appeal is that
they are young,
hard-bodied studs

39:59.064 --> 40:01.898
ready to fuck on a moment's
notice, and more than
once in an evening.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.433
Why do you have to be so crass?

40:03.735 --> 40:05.435
Why do you have
to be such a prude?

40:05.437 --> 40:07.788
[Cassi] I'm not a prude,

40:07.789 --> 40:10.140
I just don't want to hear
the crude details about the
prepubescent boys you screw.

40:10.142 --> 40:11.975
[Letty] They're
not prepubescent,

40:11.976 --> 40:13.809
they just shave
themselves clean; it's
a generational thing.

40:14.479 --> 40:16.679
[Cassi] I thought Millenials are
into having hair down there.

40:16.681 --> 40:19.416
[Letty] I can't stand
being hairy. I think
I'll always have a bald--

40:19.418 --> 40:21.751
[Cassi] Okay. Okay... I get it.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.687
[Letty] I can't remember,
have you ever tasted pussy?

40:25.123 --> 40:29.025
Okay, now you're just
trying to be shocking; and,
please don't use that word.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.727
No, I'm sincerely wondering.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.595
No! I haven't. Not interested.

40:32.597 --> 40:36.966
I used to fuck around
with my cousin, Rita, when
we were in our early teens.

40:36.968 --> 40:40.670
And, I only mention this
because, I tasted so much
sweeter back then;

40:40.672 --> 40:42.772
and I think it's the same
for men's semen too.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.442
Can we please talk
about anything else?

40:46.211 --> 40:48.545
Do you think your mom has
ever shaved her vagina?

40:51.950 --> 40:54.918
Cass, I'm joking! [laughing]

40:59.825 --> 41:01.925
I think the biggest
reason I don't like being
in relationships

41:01.927 --> 41:03.793
is because you also have
to date that person's family.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.829
Yeah, I mean, it can be tricky.

41:05.831 --> 41:08.731
Especially when for no
reason grounded in reality,

41:08.733 --> 41:11.618
they suddenly decide
they don't like you.

41:11.619 --> 41:14.504
But when you have lost as many
people in your family as I have,
it can also be a nice thing.

41:14.506 --> 41:16.556
I guess.

41:16.557 --> 41:18.607
I mean, I just never even
liked playing at other kids'
houses when I was a kid,

41:18.610 --> 41:21.144
because suddenly you gotta
abide by someone else's rules.

41:21.146 --> 41:24.848
Yeah, well, you don't have to
play exactly by their rules, you
just have to be mindful of them.

41:24.850 --> 41:26.716
Nah. I hate rules.

41:26.718 --> 41:27.984
Everybody hates rules.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.052
Not everyone.

41:29.054 --> 41:32.956
You know, I think my ideal
woman would be an
eighteen- year-old orphan

41:32.958 --> 41:36.493
who just lost her entire family
and inherited a billion dollars.

41:39.030 --> 41:41.798
[Letty] Does Oliver
ever get frustrated

41:41.799 --> 41:44.567
with how inundated
the world is with amateur
filmmakers these days?

41:44.569 --> 41:47.704
[Cassi] You've heard his rants.
It's beyond frustrating.

41:48.206 --> 41:51.274
[Letty] Yeah, well, I think
it's brave of him that he's
still making a go of it.

41:51.943 --> 41:55.144
It must be unnerving
knowing that everyone with a
cell phone or YouTube account

41:55.146 --> 41:56.813
thinks of themselves
as an auteur.

41:57.249 --> 41:58.915
[Cassi] He just doesn't
know what else he would do.

41:58.917 --> 42:02.151
I mean, this is what he's
wanted since he was a kid.

42:02.153 --> 42:05.255
He's very passionate about
it. It's all he knows.

42:05.957 --> 42:10.293
And, I truly feel like the cream
rises to the top, so it's just
a matter of time for him.

42:11.930 --> 42:14.163
[Letty] He's lucky to have had
your support all this time.

42:15.100 --> 42:19.269
I mean, no offense, but I
too would have to be with
somebody financially endowed.

42:20.238 --> 42:24.007
[Cassi] Wait, you know
Oliver has his own money and
you have plenty of your own.

42:24.676 --> 42:27.110
[Letty] Yeah, but
I wouldn't want to have
to take care of them.

42:27.112 --> 42:29.279
It would make me too resentful.

42:29.281 --> 42:32.282
Plus, I would never date anyone
who was broke or in debt.

42:32.951 --> 42:36.019
[Cassi] Yeah, I feel like that's
pretty hard to find nowadays,

42:36.021 --> 42:38.121
but you definitely don't want to
marry somebody who's in debt.

42:38.623 --> 42:39.923
But money isn't everything.

42:40.559 --> 42:42.225
[Letty] Yeah, I just think
we're at the age now

42:42.227 --> 42:45.478
where financial security
factors into love.

42:45.479 --> 42:48.730
It's not just needing to be with
somebody at all costs, like it
feels when you're twenty-one.

42:49.034 --> 42:52.101
I would have to know that if
necessary, this person could
take care of me financially.

42:53.004 --> 42:56.606
Well, maybe when you're actually
ready to be in a relationship,

42:56.608 --> 42:58.575
you could be Donald
Trump's fifth wife?

42:59.010 --> 43:01.277
Fuck no! I'd rather have
Ivanka shit in my mouth

43:01.279 --> 43:04.013
than touch his old, disgusting,
drooping, ginger balls.

43:04.015 --> 43:07.400
Gross! Letty, come on.

43:07.401 --> 43:10.786
I'll bet his pubic hair curls
over his dick like he fancies
that dead squirrel on his head.

43:12.357 --> 43:14.057
[Cassi] I actually
have no comment.

43:14.059 --> 43:18.728
[Max] Did I ever tell you
that I lost my virginity
to my step-sister?

43:18.730 --> 43:21.281
[Oliver] At least
a hundred times.

43:21.282 --> 43:23.833
[Max] Well, did I mention that
after our parents separated,
we tried dating for real?

43:23.835 --> 43:25.768
[Oliver] No, I'd have
remembered that.

43:25.770 --> 43:27.937
[Max] I don't know why
I only attract crazy girls.

43:27.939 --> 43:31.608
[Oliver] Yeah, because
I told you: calm attracts calm
and crazy attracts crazy.

43:31.610 --> 43:34.811
[Max] Yeah, well
I'd change my energy,
but crazy loves to fuck!

43:35.113 --> 43:38.648
Anyway, I never felt that
weird, because, you know,
we weren't related,

43:38.650 --> 43:40.650
and, I think outsiders
viewed it differently

43:40.652 --> 43:43.470
'cause we did grow up together
since we were, like, ten.

43:43.471 --> 43:46.289
[Oliver] Yeah, I'm pretty sure
anyone who is not on parole for
a lewd and lascivious sex act,

43:46.291 --> 43:49.292
views all your
proclivities differently,
sexual or otherwise.

43:49.294 --> 43:52.328
[Max] Actually, I ran into her
a few years ago, and believe
it or not, she apologized to me

43:52.330 --> 43:54.130
for having had sex with her
at such a young age.

43:54.699 --> 43:57.133
The only reason she was even
sexually aware to begin with

43:57.135 --> 44:00.203
is because she was molested
by a family member about a year
before our parents had met.

44:00.205 --> 44:03.706
-[Oliver] That's terrible.
-[Max] Yeah, I felt awful
for her. It's horrible.

44:03.708 --> 44:06.309
[Oliver] You know, I was
molested when I was a kid.

44:07.245 --> 44:08.911
[Max] You never told me
you were molested.

44:08.913 --> 44:11.080
[Oliver] Yeah, well, I try
not to refer to it that way

44:11.082 --> 44:13.916
out of respect for those
who were more
seriously affected.

44:13.918 --> 44:16.419
[Max] Well, who did it?
Was it a baby sitter?
Was she hot at least?

44:16.421 --> 44:19.656
[Oliver] No, it was a family
friend, and it wasn't a she.

44:19.658 --> 44:21.975
-[Max] You were
molested by a guy?
-[Oliver] Sort of.

44:21.976 --> 44:24.293
-[Max] What do you mean sort of?
-[Oliver] Look, I was
twelve, he was fifteen.

44:24.295 --> 44:26.429
According to my shrink,
that's a clear molestation.

44:26.431 --> 44:29.198
-[Max] Yeah, but...?
-[Oliver] I didn't think so
because I initiated it.

44:29.200 --> 44:32.368
[Max] Ah, dude, you were
definitely molested. That
guy should have known better.

44:32.370 --> 44:34.287
[Oliver] I suppose.

44:34.288 --> 44:36.205
Dude, you sound like one
of those kidnap victims
with Stockholm syndrome.

44:36.207 --> 44:38.085
No, I'm just saying--

44:38.086 --> 44:39.964
Look, I know what you're
saying, okay? I got it, I
know what you're saying.

44:39.965 --> 44:41.843
And you were definitely
molested. That guy
should have known better.

44:41.846 --> 44:43.246
Yeah? Well, it happened.

44:44.015 --> 44:45.982
Fuck. So did your
parents find out?

44:45.984 --> 44:48.885
I told my mom but I begged
her not to tell my dad.

44:48.887 --> 44:52.422
I was terrified he would
run down the street
and literally kill the guy.

44:53.124 --> 44:57.060
So-- It's like so sick to me
how we feel the need to protect
those who harm us?

44:57.062 --> 44:58.995
Yeah, you know,
the worst part is,

44:58.997 --> 45:01.464
is that two weeks later
I tried to doing the same

45:01.465 --> 45:03.932
thing to this foreign kid
I went to school with,
and he freaked out,

45:03.935 --> 45:06.269
and I stopped before anything
happened -- I ran home crying.

45:06.271 --> 45:09.806
And, I didn't know this then,
of course, but looking
back, hindsight what it is,

45:10.275 --> 45:12.909
obviously that was an attempt
for me to take my power back.

45:12.911 --> 45:15.411
Yeah, well, it must have
definitely affected you
more than you thought.

45:15.413 --> 45:18.247
-Okay, can we talk about
something else?
-Yeah. Fine.

45:18.917 --> 45:22.351
I think you should, uh,
write something other than
those little talkie-talks.

45:22.353 --> 45:24.153
Like, maybe, maybe a horror
film, or something.

45:24.155 --> 45:25.855
I write slice of life stuff.

45:25.857 --> 45:27.440
Yeah, you write about yourself.

45:27.441 --> 45:29.024
I write about what I am going
through. What's wrong with that?

45:29.027 --> 45:30.693
There's nothing wrong
with that, but you, bro,

45:30.694 --> 45:32.360
you're going on and on
about a film you're
thinking about writing,

45:32.363 --> 45:35.231
that essentially centers around
your current life situation,

45:35.233 --> 45:39.035
instead of focusing on what
you could be doing about
that situation in reality.

45:39.037 --> 45:41.471
So, it's self-indulgent,
it's narcissistic,

45:41.473 --> 45:43.806
uh, you're setting yourself up
for failure, and, you know,

45:43.808 --> 45:45.475
worst part is you're
not even aware of it.

45:45.477 --> 45:48.945
Well let's not forget about
the impending sense of doom
I feel on a daily basis?

45:48.947 --> 45:51.013
Ah well, so what?
You're also depressive.

45:51.015 --> 45:53.349
But, we've always
known that, you know?

45:53.351 --> 45:56.052
Okay, you know what?
How's about a little silence
for a change?

45:56.054 --> 45:56.753
Perfect.

45:56.755 --> 45:59.856
I think you should take
some time, reflect on
what we just discussed,

45:59.858 --> 46:01.574
really absorb it, you know?

46:01.575 --> 46:03.291
-Yeah, I'd like to absorb
you in the East River.
-Hmm...

46:07.198 --> 46:10.900
[Cassi] I feel like I'm not as
intelligent or as mentally
equipped as my parents were

46:10.902 --> 46:13.503
at my age to make
significant decisions.

46:13.505 --> 46:16.272
[Letty] I'm sure your parents
felt the same way
when they were your age.

46:16.274 --> 46:18.207
[Cassi] I promise
you they didn't.

46:18.209 --> 46:20.176
By the time they were
my age they were married,

46:20.178 --> 46:23.846
working professionals,
who owned a house
and had two kids.

46:23.848 --> 46:26.149
[Letty] Yeah? And, how'd
that turn out for them?

46:26.484 --> 46:28.451
[Cassi] Point taken.
But, divorce aside,

46:28.453 --> 46:33.489
I'm talking about
their individual, mental
capabilities to retain knowledge

46:33.491 --> 46:36.425
and handle life-changing
decisions.

46:36.427 --> 46:39.395
[Letty] Yeah, well, they
were post-war children,
they had to grow up faster.

46:39.397 --> 46:42.465
And, I might add, it's because
of our parents' successes

46:42.467 --> 46:46.235
that our generation
has been afforded a way
of life that lends itself,

46:46.237 --> 46:49.906
or rather, actually imposes
self-reflection, and delays
our emotional growth.

46:50.475 --> 46:56.012
[Cassi] In other words,
it's our parents' fault that
our generation is stupid?

46:56.447 --> 47:00.516
[Letty] No, it's not a question
of intelligence. It's a question
of motivation, a lack of drive,

47:00.518 --> 47:03.953
stemming from the
overbearing sense of being
too good for anything,

47:03.955 --> 47:05.321
which is, in fact, their fault.

47:06.291 --> 47:08.408
[Cassi] So, in other words,

47:08.409 --> 47:10.526
because our parents
made us feel like we're
center of the universe,

47:10.528 --> 47:14.463
it backfired and turned us
into spoiled, entitled brats.

47:15.066 --> 47:17.867
[Letty] No, that would
be Millennials.

47:18.937 --> 47:24.273
We're just late bloomers.
And it's not a question of our--
our mental capabilities.

47:26.978 --> 47:28.010
[Cassi] I don't know.

47:28.012 --> 47:33.449
I truly feel like will never be
as smart as my parents were.

47:33.451 --> 47:36.185
[Letty] Yeah, well. I disagree.

47:38.423 --> 47:43.359
[Cassi] What am I gonna do,
Letty? There's so much pressure
to make the right choice.

47:44.062 --> 47:47.263
[Letty] Well maybe the fact
that it's a hard choice speaks
louder than you think?

47:48.233 --> 47:50.533
[Cassi] But relationships
are hard.

47:52.871 --> 47:56.038
[Letty] Yeah, but choosing to be
in one shouldn't be. Even
with tons of work to be done.

48:01.479 --> 48:04.180
[Cassi] Well, unfortunately,
I don't think it can be
broken down that simply.

48:04.182 --> 48:06.949
[Letty] Everything can be
reduced to basic human impulses.

48:07.385 --> 48:09.252
[Cassi] Well, my impulse
says to stay with Oliver

48:09.254 --> 48:12.154
and work on what we
have invested in over
the last five years.

48:12.590 --> 48:15.458
-[Letty] Yeah, but to what end?
-[Cassi] Hopefully to no end.

48:17.295 --> 48:19.528
[Letty] Yeah, but that doesn't
justify making a poor decision

48:19.530 --> 48:21.430
when you have all of the
information ahead of time.

48:22.033 --> 48:24.767
[Cassi] What's that
supposed to mean?

48:24.768 --> 48:27.502
[Letty] It means that
blindfolding yourself is not
the same as being blind.

48:29.374 --> 48:31.340
Cass, what are we doing?

48:31.342 --> 48:33.209
[Cassi] We're going to get food.

48:33.211 --> 48:37.246
[Letty] No, I know, but what
are we doing right now?
Why are we together?

48:37.248 --> 48:39.749
Why are we wandering
around the city

48:39.750 --> 48:42.251
when you should be sitting
with Oliver and talking
to him about all of this?

48:42.253 --> 48:45.521
[Cassi] I told you, Oliver
and I needed space
to gain perspective.

48:46.691 --> 48:49.659
[Letty] Okay, but you've been
apart for over two weeks.
That hasn't been enough?

48:50.161 --> 48:53.029
[Cassi] If you're sick of
talking about this, just say so.

48:53.431 --> 48:57.166
[Letty] Cass, that is so unfair.
I've been there for you
every step of the way.

48:57.168 --> 48:59.502
I've sat up with you, cried
with you, laughed with you,

48:59.504 --> 49:01.370
listened to everything
you've had to say...

49:02.173 --> 49:03.773
[Cassi] But...?

49:03.774 --> 49:05.374
[Letty] But you don't seem
to want to be in action.

49:05.376 --> 49:09.011
You just want to talk, and not
even about what's important.

49:09.012 --> 49:12.647
And, when you are in action, it
always seems counter-productive
to improving your dilemma.

49:12.650 --> 49:13.649
[Cassi] Meaning?

49:13.651 --> 49:17.153
[Letty] Meaning, you say
you want to work
on your relationship,

49:17.155 --> 49:19.488
but instead you go on a date
with an ex-boyfriend.

49:20.325 --> 49:21.724
[Cassi] It wasn't a date.

49:21.726 --> 49:24.126
[Letty] Yeah, well, whatever
it was, it wasn't kosher.

49:24.128 --> 49:25.661
[Cassi] How can you judge me?

49:26.431 --> 49:29.198
[Letty] A, what your implying
is really fucked up,

49:29.200 --> 49:32.735
and B, I'm not
judging you. I'm your best
friend; I love you. I'm just--

49:32.737 --> 49:35.137
I'm trying to open
your fucking eyes.

49:35.139 --> 49:36.539
[Cassi] Maybe
I don't want to see.

49:37.475 --> 49:39.776
[Letty] Yeah, that's my point!

49:39.777 --> 49:42.078
So why even bother
struggling with this shit?
Just fucking end it.

49:42.447 --> 49:44.747
[Cassi] Why are you getting
so worked up?

49:44.749 --> 49:47.633
[Letty] Because, I'm sick
of hearing about problems

49:47.634 --> 49:50.518
you're not willing to work
toward a solution on. Especially
when it comes to relationships,

49:50.521 --> 49:54.390
which I don't even believe in,
and it's always I who has
to convince you to stay.

49:54.392 --> 49:56.625
[Cassi] Okay, relax. I'm sorry.

49:56.627 --> 49:58.427
[Letty] No, it's really
frustrating, Cassi.

49:58.429 --> 50:00.629
[Cassi] I know.
I said I'm sorry.

50:00.631 --> 50:04.367
[Letty] Yeah, well you won't
work on it, so your apology
doesn't mean shit.

50:07.638 --> 50:10.039
[Cassi] Okay. I'll
change. I hear you.

50:11.009 --> 50:14.143
[Letty] And, knock
this shit off with Charlie.
Stop talking him to...

50:14.145 --> 50:16.212
stop talking to him altogether.

50:17.081 --> 50:19.632
[Cassi] All right,
I said I'll change.

50:19.633 --> 50:22.184
Now, can you just stop talking
for a minute? I need to think.

50:22.653 --> 50:28.190
[Letty] Yeah, that's my point:
stop thinking, go to Oliver.
Talk to him about all of this.

50:32.563 --> 50:34.263
[Cassi] I don't know
what I've been doing.

50:35.233 --> 50:36.599
[Letty] Self-preserving.

50:38.603 --> 50:40.102
[Cassi] Thank you, Letty.

50:40.538 --> 50:41.637
I love you.

50:41.639 --> 50:45.674
[Letty] I love you too. Now, go.
Go, go, go. I'll be fine.

50:45.676 --> 50:46.709
-[Cassi] Okay.
-[Letty] I love you.

50:46.711 --> 50:48.144
[Cassi] I'm gonna
go to Brooklyn.

50:48.513 --> 50:50.179
-[Letty] Okay.
-[Cassi] I'll text you later.

50:51.482 --> 50:52.548
Love you.

50:55.053 --> 50:56.619
[Letty exhales]

51:12.537 --> 51:15.304
[Max] So why haven't you been
talking to your therapist
about all this Cassi stuff?

51:15.306 --> 51:17.440
[Oliver] What are you
talking about?! Of course
I talk to her about this.

51:17.442 --> 51:19.542
[Max] I don't know, it just
seems like you haven't
given it much thought.

51:19.544 --> 51:22.144
[Oliver] Are you kidding me?
If anything, I've given it
too much thought.

51:22.146 --> 51:24.547
-[Max] So then
where's the action?
-[Oliver] It's complicated,

51:24.549 --> 51:26.515
there's a lot of pressure
to make the right move.

51:26.517 --> 51:27.783
[Max] Yeah, but
is there a right move?

51:27.785 --> 51:29.185
[Oliver] Obviously
there's a right move.

51:29.187 --> 51:30.753
Otherwise there wouldn't
be so much pressure.

51:30.755 --> 51:33.222
[Max] Yeah, but what if that
pressure could just be removed?

51:33.224 --> 51:34.991
[Oliver] How do you mean?

51:34.992 --> 51:36.759
I don't know. Maybe, you guys
agree to stay together and
you don't renew the lease,

51:36.761 --> 51:38.995
but, you know, maybe
find someplace else to stay.

51:38.996 --> 51:41.230
-[Oliver] No, no.
Definitely not in the cards.
-[Max] Why not?

51:41.232 --> 51:43.666
[Oliver] Because, that's
not how it works when
you're in a relationship

51:43.668 --> 51:46.185
and living together with
someone for five years.

51:46.186 --> 51:48.703
-[Max] Yeah, but who's rules
are these? I mean, why?
-[Oliver] That's just how it is.

51:48.706 --> 51:51.607
-Yeah, but who says?
I mean, why does it have to be?
-Be-- uh -- oh my god!

51:51.609 --> 51:53.876
-Are you trying to fuck
with my patience?
-No.

51:53.877 --> 51:56.144
No, I think you are.
I think you think if you
get under my skin

51:56.147 --> 51:58.280
it's gonna cause me
to make a move in one
direction or another,

51:58.282 --> 52:01.417
but, I'm telling you, Max,
it's not helpful and I
really wish you'd stop it.

52:01.419 --> 52:03.519
Dude, I'm just trying to get
you to focus on your problems

52:03.521 --> 52:05.872
and solve shit out
with Cassi. That's all.

52:05.873 --> 52:08.224
How are you trying to get me
to focus? You haven't said
anything even remotely helpful.

52:08.226 --> 52:09.425
Yeah, well, that's my style.

52:09.427 --> 52:11.444
-What?
-Yeah, you know.

52:11.445 --> 52:13.462
I get your attention
that's concentrated on
something else, okay?

52:13.464 --> 52:15.731
And if the subject
you're fretting upon
is strong enough, okay,

52:15.733 --> 52:18.634
it's gonna pull will pull you
back and make it undeniably
imperative to deal with.

52:18.636 --> 52:21.704
Right, right. But how do you
explain what comes out of your
mouth the rest of the time?

52:22.373 --> 52:24.240
You know what, man?
Fuck this shit.

52:24.242 --> 52:26.509
I don't need to be hanging out
with friends who are ungrateful.

52:27.145 --> 52:28.444
Come on -- you know I'm joking.

52:28.446 --> 52:31.347
Yeah, but I'm not joking.
I'm not joking, man.

52:31.349 --> 52:33.315
Listen, let me make
a blunt observation, okay?

52:33.317 --> 52:35.301
-Please?
-Yeah, yeah, fine.

52:35.302 --> 52:37.286
-Listen, I've known you a long
time, known you a long time.
-Yes.

52:37.288 --> 52:38.838
And, I've never known
you to be happy.

52:38.839 --> 52:40.389
What? No, that's not true.
I'm always generally happy.

52:40.391 --> 52:43.159
Generally happy, yes,
but specifically happy, no.

52:43.161 --> 52:45.361
That-- no, that doesn't
sound right.

52:45.830 --> 52:47.630
Okay -- why...
why you here with me?

52:47.632 --> 52:49.465
What are you talking about?
We said we're gonna hang out.

52:49.467 --> 52:52.301
-Yes, I know, but why?
-To get lunch.

52:52.303 --> 52:54.837
Okay, you're just not
getting it, okay?

52:54.838 --> 52:57.372
You're on the verge of making
the greatest decision
of your life or a the worst one,

52:57.375 --> 52:59.775
and you are not giving it
the respect and attention
it deserves.

52:59.777 --> 53:01.978
No, that's not true.

53:01.979 --> 53:04.180
It is -- it is true! Then
what are you even hanging
out with me for? Huh?

53:04.182 --> 53:06.382
Go be with Cassi, go talk
this shit through with her.

53:06.384 --> 53:09.451
I can't. We have
a no communication rule
until after five in effect.

53:09.453 --> 53:12.388
So break the fucking rule,
man! Or go fi -- go find
her, go to her sister's

53:12.390 --> 53:13.923
and go talk this
shit out with her.

53:15.560 --> 53:16.692
[exhales]

53:18.329 --> 53:19.261
Okay.

53:20.565 --> 53:23.532
You're right, you're right.
I'm gonna go...

53:24.202 --> 53:27.236
I'll go find Cassi, I'll go
to her sister's, and uh...

53:27.672 --> 53:31.540
I'll talk this out with her,
I... I don't know -- But
we haven't ate lunch.

53:31.542 --> 53:33.976
It's just-- Don't worry
about lunch, man. Just go.

53:34.512 --> 53:35.844
-You sure?
-Yeah. Just go.

53:35.846 --> 53:37.613
-You sure?
-Yeah. Go be with her.

53:37.615 --> 53:39.415
Okay. Okay, thank you.

53:39.416 --> 53:41.216
-You're welcome,
man. I love you.
-I love you too, dude.

53:41.219 --> 53:42.351
I love you. Um...

53:43.588 --> 53:45.438
Uh...

53:45.439 --> 53:47.289
-That way.
-Yes. I'm gonna--
Okay. I'll call you later.

53:47.291 --> 53:48.574
-Yeah, call me later.
-Thank you.

53:48.575 --> 53:49.858
I love you, dude.
-I love you too. I --

53:49.860 --> 53:50.759
Take care...

53:56.234 --> 53:59.001
¶¶¶

56:55.813 --> 56:57.613
[music ends]

56:57.615 --> 56:59.715
[street sounds]

57:25.009 --> 57:27.109
[subway approaching]

58:22.099 --> 58:24.066
[distant announcements
over speaker]

58:34.912 --> 58:36.678
-[Max] So, that's it?
-[Oliver] That's everything.

58:36.680 --> 58:38.280
[Max] I don't understand.

58:38.281 --> 58:39.881
-[Oliver] What don't
you understand?
-[Max] How that could be it.

58:39.884 --> 58:41.283
[Oliver] That's all
there is to tell.

58:41.285 --> 58:42.584
[Max] But nothing happened.

58:42.586 --> 58:44.636
[Oliver] A lot happened.

58:44.637 --> 58:46.687
[Max] So, what, do they renew
the lease, they stay together,
do they call it quits?

58:46.690 --> 58:48.090
[Oliver] What do you think?

58:48.091 --> 58:49.491
[Max] I think the film
is incomplete.

58:49.492 --> 58:50.892
[Oliver] I told you,
it's a slice of life story.

58:50.893 --> 58:52.293
[Max] So, that means you don't
finish it? You're a lazy writer.

58:52.296 --> 58:54.546
[Oliver] That was the finish.

58:54.547 --> 58:56.797
[Max] So, what... what
about the audience? How
are they supposed to take it?

58:56.800 --> 58:58.617
[Oliver] What about the
audience?

58:58.618 --> 59:00.435
[Max] How they supposed to
take it? Nothing was resolved.

59:00.436 --> 59:02.253
[Oliver] I don't know.
I think a lot was resolved.

59:02.254 --> 59:04.071
-[Max] So they stay together?
-[Oliver] It's whatever
you think.

59:04.074 --> 59:06.275
[Max sighs]

59:06.276 --> 59:08.477
What I think is no one
is going to watch this, okay?

59:08.478 --> 59:10.679
What I think is, is you're never
going to find an audience if you
keep writing this type of stuff.

59:10.681 --> 59:12.848
And furthermore, I think you
should focus on other genres

59:12.850 --> 59:14.550
and stop writing
this drivel immediately.

59:14.552 --> 59:16.118
Oh, you do?

59:16.119 --> 59:17.685
Yeah, I think it's gonna be
better for everybody involved.

59:17.686 --> 59:19.252
And, don't even get me
started on what the critics
are probably going to say.

59:19.256 --> 59:21.106
You don't think they'll like it?

59:21.107 --> 59:22.957
If they simply don't like it,
you're gonna be getting
away with murder.

59:22.960 --> 59:25.060
Okay, that's a little extreme.

59:25.061 --> 59:27.161
Oliver -- Oliver -- please...
Just, do not make this film.

59:27.164 --> 59:30.482
-What?
-Okay, just--
just, promise me...

59:30.483 --> 59:33.801
If I have any influence
over you, whatsoever,
please do not make this film.

59:33.804 --> 59:36.772
Okay. Relax. I-- I promise...

59:36.774 --> 59:38.640
I won't make this fi--

59:48.185 --> 59:49.851
[man] Wanna shift?

59:50.788 --> 59:52.921
-You're okay with that?
-[man 2] Okay...

59:52.923 --> 59:54.306
-[man] Two second adjustment...
-Move?

59:54.307 --> 59:55.690
-[man] Can you shift
to that one?
-[Letty] Yup.

59:56.827 --> 59:58.093
[man] Still rolling.

59:58.095 --> 59:59.728
-[Letty] This one?
-[man] Are you bored?

59:59.729 --> 1:00:01.362
[man 2] Yeah, just a little
to the side. Yeah -- thanks.

1:00:11.308 --> 1:00:16.144
First person that broke
my heart, which is
somebody I won't name...

1:00:16.146 --> 1:00:19.047
Uh-- was the first person
I was ever engaged to...

1:00:21.819 --> 1:00:23.885
I was definitely
in love with him.

1:00:25.322 --> 1:00:28.991
And, man, I went psychotic--

1:00:28.992 --> 1:00:32.661
Like, I probably would have
checked myself into a mental
institution if I knew better.

1:00:32.663 --> 1:00:36.298
I still regret my freak- outs.
They were really bad.

1:00:38.035 --> 1:00:43.405
Yeah, I think, because of that,
it brought a lot of fear for me,
absolutely, because...

1:00:44.241 --> 1:00:46.975
nobody wants to be
brokenhearted, it sucks.

1:00:46.977 --> 1:00:48.343
It's the worst pain ever.

1:00:48.345 --> 1:00:53.315
I opened my heart one time,
so big, that, I gave
all my heart away,

1:00:53.317 --> 1:00:56.218
and it just got
completely destroyed.

1:00:56.220 --> 1:00:58.320
I don't think
I've ever recovered,
to be honest with you,

1:00:59.056 --> 1:01:02.891
and, so, I think I go through
my life a little bit reserved

1:01:02.893 --> 1:01:05.327
and I don't know if
I'm ever gonna be able
to open it up all the way,

1:01:05.329 --> 1:01:06.779
'cause I don't know what--

1:01:06.780 --> 1:01:08.230
I don't want that pain
to ever happen again,
to be honest with you.

1:01:08.232 --> 1:01:09.965
it's just too much
for me to bear.

1:01:09.967 --> 1:01:13.335
Uh, so -- I kind of approach
things a little bit gentler now,

1:01:13.337 --> 1:01:16.304
and, with a little bit
of caution and pause, and...

1:01:16.306 --> 1:01:18.306
maybe I'll meet the right
one, one day, and it'll like,

1:01:18.308 --> 1:01:20.175
it'll happen again--
but I don't trust it--

1:01:20.177 --> 1:01:22.310
it doesn't ever work out
for anybody that I know.

1:01:22.312 --> 1:01:25.414
I'd never seen it really work
out, really for anybody, so...

1:01:26.083 --> 1:01:29.918
why bother -- you know?
Save a little bit for myself.
That's the way I think.

1:01:33.991 --> 1:01:37.459
[man] Why don't you think you--
you've had relationships
that have lasted?

1:01:44.334 --> 1:01:47.736
I don't know.
I think I just didn't have
a good upbringing, maybe.

1:01:48.739 --> 1:01:52.708
I mean, I feel like my
grandparents were too old
to teach me anything,

1:01:52.710 --> 1:01:55.777
and I was too young to really
want to learn anything,

1:01:55.779 --> 1:02:00.115
and they just -- they just
grew up in a different
generation, so...

1:02:02.152 --> 1:02:06.254
Maybe that's what's
scaring me with
relationships? I'm not sure.

1:02:07.424 --> 1:02:10.125
I do think Oliver is a good
long-term partner.

1:02:11.228 --> 1:02:12.828
He's needed some...

1:02:12.830 --> 1:02:19.201
Coaching every now
and then, but it's
been pretty worth it.

1:02:19.770 --> 1:02:22.204
We've had our --
we've definitely had
our ups and downs,

1:02:22.206 --> 1:02:24.806
but, I mean, we've
stayed together for five
years, so I think...

1:02:27.811 --> 1:02:29.044
I think we can do it.

1:02:31.148 --> 1:02:37.185
I know this can last, but do
I wanna just ride the wave
of being in the relationship?

1:02:37.187 --> 1:02:43.291
So are we in this because
we're fearful of being alone?

1:02:43.293 --> 1:02:47.362
Are we in this just because of
the security blanket the other
person gives the other person?

1:02:47.364 --> 1:02:52.400
That sense of-- of,
uh, longevity, and umm...

1:02:52.903 --> 1:02:56.371
such, or are we in this
because it's fulfilling,

1:02:56.373 --> 1:03:01.476
and we're growing,
and umm, you know, uh...

1:03:01.478 --> 1:03:03.545
and -- and it's enjoyable,
and it's what we want

1:03:03.547 --> 1:03:05.981
and, and I think a lot of it
does come down to fear.

1:03:05.983 --> 1:03:10.018
I think, you know a lot
of times you stay in a
relationship out of fear, and--

1:03:13.524 --> 1:03:16.308
What do I think about
Oliver and Cassi?

1:03:16.309 --> 1:03:19.093
I think it's a good thing --
I really do. I think it's a good
thing, because, Oliver's a mess,

1:03:19.096 --> 1:03:22.130
you know, he's a mess
in general, but when
he's with her,

1:03:22.132 --> 1:03:26.301
for some reason I've seen
him stabilize -- I've seen
him get, like, really grounded,

1:03:26.303 --> 1:03:28.370
he gets productive,
he gets creative...

1:03:28.372 --> 1:03:32.174
And, uh -- for whatever
reason, whatever universe
they're floating in together

1:03:32.910 --> 1:03:35.094
without judgment, I think
it's a good thing for him.

1:03:35.095 --> 1:03:37.279
So I'd like for him to get--
I'd like for him to stay
together, I really would.

1:03:37.281 --> 1:03:38.880
I think it's a good thing.

1:03:38.882 --> 1:03:40.215
[man] Do you like Cassi?

1:03:40.217 --> 1:03:41.416
Do I like Cassi?

1:03:42.052 --> 1:03:42.984
Hmm...

1:03:44.855 --> 1:03:48.423
Yeah, I do.
I think she's a good person.
I think she's a good person,

1:03:48.425 --> 1:03:50.726
she's struggling
like the rest of us.

1:03:50.727 --> 1:03:53.028
We're all trying to make our way
through the world, and do the
best we can, you know? But...

1:03:53.430 --> 1:03:56.431
yeah, in general, I think
she's a good person, she's a
sweetheart. I like her a lot.

1:03:57.868 --> 1:04:01.236
I do, I think Oliver's
a decent guy. He's...

1:04:02.606 --> 1:04:06.341
I think they're both not
perfect, in any way, and...

1:04:06.343 --> 1:04:12.214
I think they both talk a lot
and complain a whole bunch,
and they're super similar

1:04:13.116 --> 1:04:16.017
but all in all, they really
do love each other, and,

1:04:17.087 --> 1:04:19.554
they can be pretty cute
together sometimes. [chuckles]

1:04:20.858 --> 1:04:23.491
Could I see myself spending
the rest of my life with Oliver?

1:04:25.295 --> 1:04:26.194
Yes.

1:04:27.497 --> 1:04:30.432
And also, no. Um...

1:04:30.434 --> 1:04:33.602
It's a very weird time
in our relationship.

1:04:34.271 --> 1:04:36.538
And it's hard for me
to articulate why...

1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:40.375
it -- it's gotten to the point
that it's gotten to, but...

1:04:42.913 --> 1:04:46.481
I hope... I hope that he is.

1:04:48.485 --> 1:04:53.221
Uh, my mom, uh,
was uh, a terrible alcoholic
when she was younger,

1:04:53.223 --> 1:04:58.927
and she'd been sober many,
many years prior to her, uh,
passing away, but um...

1:04:59.296 --> 1:05:02.597
she used to say to me
when I'd say, "How do you
stay sober twenty-five years?"

1:05:02.599 --> 1:05:06.067
And she would say, uh, "You
know, you just don't drink."

1:05:06.069 --> 1:05:10.438
And, umm, I feel
like that's basically
how it is with relationships.

1:05:10.440 --> 1:05:13.141
So, can a relationship last for
twenty-five years? Absolutely.

1:05:13.143 --> 1:05:16.111
Just don't get divorced.
Is it fulfilling? Is it--

1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:20.115
you know, helping you
grow as a person? Uh,

1:05:20.117 --> 1:05:22.384
not only in that relationship,
but on this planet,

1:05:22.386 --> 1:05:27.489
and amongst your peers
and your family, and -- so,
I don't know, so... umm,

1:05:27.491 --> 1:05:30.959
that's kind of a -- a hard
question to answer, just...

1:05:31.328 --> 1:05:35.096
I mean the obvious
answer is yes,
relationships can last.

1:05:35.098 --> 1:05:37.098
Um... Do you want it to?

1:05:37.701 --> 1:05:38.600
I don't know.

1:05:39.670 --> 1:05:41.303
You know, right now, I like

1:05:43.307 --> 1:05:45.707
what I have with
Cassi, and um...

1:05:46.209 --> 1:05:48.043
That's the problem
with relationships,

1:05:48.045 --> 1:05:51.413
is it gets stale at
a point, but, that's up
to you guys to work on.

1:05:51.415 --> 1:05:54.616
You know, it's like,
you both have to do
something to make it exciting.

1:05:54.618 --> 1:05:59.054
Whether that's travel by
yourselves, watch porn,

1:05:59.690 --> 1:06:04.192
add somebody in with you,
I don't know, whatever
works for you, I guess.

1:06:04.194 --> 1:06:08.263
Whatever floats your boat.
But, try it, if you want to be
with somebody for a long time.

1:06:08.265 --> 1:06:09.331
Absolutely.

1:06:09.333 --> 1:06:12.600
-[man] So--
-Communication too.
That's huge.

1:06:16.540 --> 1:06:21.643
I don't know that staying
in a relationship is...

1:06:23.714 --> 1:06:31.152
guaranteeing that you're
having deeper meaning
in your life, or relationship.

1:06:31.154 --> 1:06:34.689
But the more I'm learning about
relationships, I'm learning
that cheating is actual--

1:06:34.691 --> 1:06:38.426
it's kind of a contract,
and I think it's different with
every-- every relationship.

1:06:38.428 --> 1:06:44.499
To me, in my mind, cheating
is when I'm taking my sexual
energy, and my emotional energy,

1:06:44.501 --> 1:06:48.036
and taking it outside
the relationship in any form,
to be honest with you,

1:06:48.038 --> 1:06:50.238
and that means flirting,
to a certain extent,

1:06:50.240 --> 1:06:52.640
you know, I know
inside when I'm across
the line, like, would this--

1:06:53.210 --> 1:06:57.712
if this was seen by my
significant other, would she,
like, would this hurt her?

1:06:57.714 --> 1:07:02.650
And if I could think that
and-- and say yes to
that, I think that's cheating.

1:07:02.652 --> 1:07:05.153
I really do. I think most
women would agree.

1:07:08.625 --> 1:07:10.926
I'm not most women,
but that's what I think.

1:07:10.927 --> 1:07:13.228
The point you know, and
you consider what you're
doing is cheating, is, I think,

1:07:13.230 --> 1:07:15.363
the second you get
that "uh-oh" feeling

1:07:15.365 --> 1:07:17.699
and that's usually, like,
that feeling in your gut,

1:07:17.701 --> 1:07:22.437
and I feel like that's usually--
even the second you text
or call someone else.

1:07:22.439 --> 1:07:24.606
Or if someone else
is even serving as, like,

1:07:24.608 --> 1:07:29.477
an emotional support
for you that your
boyfriend isn't, but it's

1:07:29.479 --> 1:07:31.613
another male.
You know-- I think...

1:07:32.716 --> 1:07:37.819
I think I got involved
with my ex-boyfriend,
Charlie, because...

1:07:39.589 --> 1:07:44.059
I was looking for a way
out of my relationship
with Oliver in a way.

1:07:44.828 --> 1:07:48.163
We've been having the same
conversations over
and over and over again

1:07:48.165 --> 1:07:52.600
for the past five years,
and some things just
haven't changed and...

1:07:53.837 --> 1:07:56.704
One of which, being the passion.

1:07:58.341 --> 1:08:02.477
And, Charlie and I
just have always had a more
passionate relationship

1:08:02.479 --> 1:08:06.214
if I compared the
two, that's what really
stood out, is, we just--

1:08:06.683 --> 1:08:09.084
the sex was great. So...

1:08:09.553 --> 1:08:14.255
and Oliver and I haven't
been sleeping together, so...

1:08:15.625 --> 1:08:18.393
You know, that's a whole
other thing and that's
interesting to me too,

1:08:18.395 --> 1:08:22.363
like, why stay in a relationship
after you know somebody is...
cheated or something,

1:08:22.365 --> 1:08:24.732
I -- You know what?
Because... what
else is out there?

1:08:24.734 --> 1:08:28.703
You got -- you got,
uh... a whole new set
up and all that stuff

1:08:28.705 --> 1:08:33.108
and also it's an
opportunity to work on your
trust and growth and such.

1:08:33.110 --> 1:08:35.844
And it's not so easy,
just throwing people
away, you know?

1:08:35.846 --> 1:08:38.697
It's uh... uh...

1:08:38.698 --> 1:08:41.549
And -- umm... you
know, we've lived together
for five years, so, um...

1:08:41.885 --> 1:08:45.253
I don't know.
I don't know, uh...
where we're going exactly,

1:08:45.255 --> 1:08:48.323
but I do know I am not
done with it yet.

1:08:48.325 --> 1:08:51.593
That's the thing.
As much as I don't
want relationships,

1:08:51.595 --> 1:08:55.196
and they scare the shit
out of me, I'd still like to
grow old with somebody.

1:08:56.366 --> 1:08:58.199
How do you do that?
I don't know.

1:09:01.204 --> 1:09:04.839
Obviously everyone wants
to feel love. But the older
I get, I feel like...

1:09:05.509 --> 1:09:08.443
the financial security is way --
is... not way more important,

1:09:08.445 --> 1:09:12.580
but it's definitely something
to consider, you know?

1:09:12.582 --> 1:09:16.251
If I'm like, popping
out kids, and I can't
work for a little bit,

1:09:16.253 --> 1:09:18.753
the other person has to
be able to support me

1:09:18.755 --> 1:09:21.856
at least us, while we're--
while I'm, you know...

1:09:21.858 --> 1:09:23.925
while it's like,
attached to my tit.

1:09:23.927 --> 1:09:25.627
So, um...

1:09:26.463 --> 1:09:28.663
I don't know. Ugh.

1:09:29.799 --> 1:09:30.732
I guess, love.

1:09:31.601 --> 1:09:32.800
Love, yeah.

1:09:32.802 --> 1:09:37.839
Uh... Am I staying in this out
of convenience or fear?

1:09:37.841 --> 1:09:40.675
Hopefully, those are not
the only two options.

1:09:42.345 --> 1:09:46.481
I don't think, ultimately I'm
staying in it out of fear, uh...

1:09:46.483 --> 1:09:52.654
I just think it's something I'm
not quite ready to let go of,
if that's the way it's gonna go.

1:09:52.656 --> 1:09:57.425
Umm... and --
and I do think, just,
we deserve, uh...

1:09:57.427 --> 1:10:00.428
You know -- to give
it a chance, to, uh,

1:10:01.264 --> 1:10:03.932
see what's next.

1:10:03.933 --> 1:10:06.601
All -- although, it is, um,
scary to think that we'd resign
this, you know, lease and--

1:10:06.603 --> 1:10:10.271
and then, uh, have
a terrible fight in a--
a week, or a month, and

1:10:10.707 --> 1:10:16.711
then we're locked into this--
you know, living together
and not wanting to. Um...

1:10:17.314 --> 1:10:20.448
Which we've kind of been
in that place before
and I slept on the couch

1:10:20.450 --> 1:10:23.751
but that's neither here
nor there, but it's--
it's just-- it's not fun,

1:10:23.753 --> 1:10:29.257
uh, being in a tight quarter
with somebody you're going
through a rough time with. Um--

1:10:29.259 --> 1:10:31.693
Do -- do I think I
wanna have kids ever?

1:10:33.330 --> 1:10:35.363
No. No.

1:10:35.732 --> 1:10:39.567
It's like, I don't wanna
pass on whatever fucked
up thing I might have

1:10:39.569 --> 1:10:41.836
to any potential
offspring I have.

1:10:41.838 --> 1:10:45.373
I don't think I could take care
of 'em the right way. I think
I'd be a fucked up father.

1:10:45.375 --> 1:10:49.244
I know how to love,
and I love kids, but I'd
rather do it from a distance,

1:10:49.246 --> 1:10:50.645
I don't even wanna
bring it in to the mix.

1:10:50.647 --> 1:10:52.947
I don't want to subject
a kid to any of my bullshit.

1:10:52.949 --> 1:10:53.781
I just don't.

1:10:53.783 --> 1:10:57.318
I think Oliver would
be a really great dad.

1:10:57.320 --> 1:10:59.554
I just don't think he thinks
he would be a great dad.

1:10:59.556 --> 1:11:04.025
And that's the sad part
because-- I mean, we've
talked about having kids, and...

1:11:06.529 --> 1:11:09.597
I think the thought of him
having to be responsible
for a human life

1:11:09.599 --> 1:11:11.733
freaks him out
a little bit. And...

1:11:11.735 --> 1:11:16.638
he's definitely had
his share of pregnancy
scares, with other people.

1:11:17.274 --> 1:11:20.775
So, he's considered it, but--

1:11:21.845 --> 1:11:25.480
Do I think Cassi and I want
the same thing? Um...

1:11:26.583 --> 1:11:29.484
Well, we want different things
out of our, you know, like,

1:11:29.853 --> 1:11:33.321
personal lives, it seems
sometimes but, uh... but--

1:11:33.323 --> 1:11:35.590
but in a relationship, I think
we want the same thing.

1:11:35.592 --> 1:11:40.662
I think we're both
looking for a significant
other who wants

1:11:40.664 --> 1:11:47.869
to make the other laugh,
and, you know, enjoy interesting
conversations and films,

1:11:47.871 --> 1:11:49.604
and, at times,

1:11:51.408 --> 1:11:53.541
she gets a little bored

1:11:54.077 --> 1:11:56.644
and then I get complacent,

1:11:57.314 --> 1:12:02.884
and then we forget
and lose touch with what
we actually want, and,

1:12:02.886 --> 1:12:05.420
uh, it's hard to see that
we want the same thing, but...

1:12:05.422 --> 1:12:10.725
I think, ultimately, um, we do.
And, I think that the
fact that we're even

1:12:11.695 --> 1:12:14.829
trying to figure this out
so hard, whether or not
we should stay together

1:12:14.831 --> 1:12:18.666
is proof that we do pretty much
want the same thing, it's just--

1:12:22.339 --> 1:12:25.473
Yeah, I don't know.
I -- that's not such an--

1:12:25.475 --> 1:12:28.843
I'm -- I'm not sure I can
answer that question. So...

1:12:29.546 --> 1:12:31.045
No, no, you know what? I don't.

1:12:31.047 --> 1:12:34.015
I don't. I think I am some days
and I think I'm not other days,

1:12:34.017 --> 1:12:35.850
you know, like,
maybe two days ago

1:12:35.852 --> 1:12:37.819
I was -- I was
a raging narcissist.

1:12:37.821 --> 1:12:40.555
I didn't give a fuck
about people in my life,

1:12:40.557 --> 1:12:43.458
I didn't give a fuck
about my family, I didn't
even give a fuck about--

1:12:43.927 --> 1:12:45.526
people that I care about.

1:12:48.031 --> 1:12:50.365
But, you know, the fact
that I even feel anything...

1:12:54.604 --> 1:12:58.473
the fact that I give a fuck
about any of it, makes me feel
like, no, I'm not a narcissist,

1:12:58.475 --> 1:13:00.908
'cause I care. I ca-- I care...

1:13:05.382 --> 1:13:07.115
So, no, I'm not a narcissist.

1:13:09.619 --> 1:13:10.785
Fuck, man.

1:13:13.089 --> 1:13:19.694
To me a narcissist is someone
whose entire universe

1:13:19.696 --> 1:13:24.999
and life and every
waking thought kinda
revolves around them.

1:13:25.001 --> 1:13:29.537
I honestly don't think
I am a narcissist,
uh, straightforward.

1:13:29.539 --> 1:13:33.708
I think we all have
narcissistic qualities,
uh, especially nowadays

1:13:33.710 --> 1:13:39.947
with the advent of, like,
um, social medias,
and-- and, like, you know.

1:13:39.949 --> 1:13:46.154
All-- all of the--
I mean, the selfie alone
is like, a pure, uh,

1:13:46.956 --> 1:13:52.593
kind of, you know, extension
of narcissism, I feel.

1:13:52.595 --> 1:13:54.796
Um, I have times when I think,

1:13:55.465 --> 1:14:00.201
uh, I don't give a shit
what happens to,
you know, A, B, and C,

1:14:00.203 --> 1:14:01.936
I've gotta get this
thing done for me,

1:14:01.938 --> 1:14:04.539
because this is my dream
and this is what I'm doing

1:14:04.541 --> 1:14:06.841
and fuck you if you're
not on board and...

1:14:07.143 --> 1:14:09.477
You know, those
kind of things, um...

1:14:09.479 --> 1:14:11.846
But it's a tricky question
because, I think--

1:14:11.848 --> 1:14:14.782
and that's one of the
things that I was trying
to do in making this film

1:14:14.784 --> 1:14:16.751
was -- I want people to
think about those things,

1:14:16.753 --> 1:14:19.620
I want people
to think about where,

1:14:19.622 --> 1:14:22.690
uh, they've been more selfish,
or less selfish, and...

1:14:22.692 --> 1:14:25.660
and how do you relate
to what these characters
are going through?

1:14:25.662 --> 1:14:28.596
I think Oliver is a narcissist
to a certain degree,

1:14:28.598 --> 1:14:30.631
but I think we're all
narcissists in some way.

1:14:30.633 --> 1:14:34.068
I mean, you have to be
in order to survive, right?

1:14:34.070 --> 1:14:35.670
That's... you know --

1:14:35.672 --> 1:14:38.473
narcissism is kind of what
keeps us alive, in a way.

1:14:39.108 --> 1:14:41.576
I don't think he's a hundred
percent one, but...

1:14:43.613 --> 1:14:45.947
I think... that...

1:14:46.683 --> 1:14:48.249
he's definitely...

1:14:48.751 --> 1:14:50.618
He needs to grow
up a little bit.

1:14:51.688 --> 1:14:56.958
I'm, uh, Oliver, and I'm the
writer, director of the film.

1:14:58.127 --> 1:15:02.830
I made this film, because--
Well, I mean, as a writer,

1:15:02.832 --> 1:15:06.801
and a filmmaker,
you know, I'm always
looking for my next, um,

1:15:07.203 --> 1:15:11.138
story to tell, of course, and--
and always working out
a new narrative,

1:15:11.140 --> 1:15:17.144
and something that interests me.
You know, I really wanted
to explore subjects, uh,

1:15:17.146 --> 1:15:21.816
and, um, themes that were, um...

1:15:23.686 --> 1:15:31.259
accurate and current
to what my, uh peer groups
and friends actually discuss,

1:15:31.261 --> 1:15:34.896
things that we would talk about,
things that we do talk about.

1:15:34.898 --> 1:15:37.031
Hopefully entertaining,
to a degree.

1:15:37.033 --> 1:15:42.203
Hopefully interesting. Might
spark some conversation
to anybody who watches it,

1:15:42.205 --> 1:15:47.108
afterwards, to uh,
maybe debate some
subjects, or whatnot.

1:15:47.110 --> 1:15:52.747
I mean, I guess I'm the
same as the person that
I wrote about in this film.

1:15:52.749 --> 1:15:55.816
Was that the question?
Am I the same as the
person I wrote about?

1:15:55.818 --> 1:15:57.652
I think, yes,
I am the character.

1:15:57.654 --> 1:16:01.923
I think, maybe I
exemplify some flaws, or,

1:16:01.925 --> 1:16:07.061
uh, exaggerated
some characteristics
of certain characters, but...

1:16:07.063 --> 1:16:13.034
This is the first film
where I named the
character the same name,

1:16:13.036 --> 1:16:16.003
uh, that I have, Oliver, so...
I've never done that before.

1:16:16.005 --> 1:16:21.142
Usually, I, you know, choose
some name that I've--
You know, and not only that,

1:16:21.144 --> 1:16:26.948
I named the other characters
the same. I really think I was
trying to capture, uh, um,

1:16:27.884 --> 1:16:30.068
something real.

1:16:30.069 --> 1:16:32.253
Who are the other people?
Well, okay, so, uh...

1:16:32.255 --> 1:16:37.124
They are my confidants, uh, my

1:16:37.126 --> 1:16:42.229
you know, pool of friends
who ground me.

1:16:42.231 --> 1:16:47.301
Um, people who make me
feel safe and secure,
who I bounce my ideas off of

1:16:47.303 --> 1:16:54.275
who challenge me on my belief
systems, and-- and, uh,
the ways I think, and, uh...

1:16:54.277 --> 1:16:58.379
you know, kind of hold
me up to be, umm,
to a higher standard,

1:16:58.381 --> 1:17:02.316
to be the best version
of Oliver that I can be.

1:17:02.819 --> 1:17:05.353
[man] What is your goal
with the project?

1:17:05.355 --> 1:17:08.606
Oh, back to the film.

1:17:08.607 --> 1:17:11.858
Well, as a filmmaker, your--
The goal is to make the film
and to make the next film, so.

1:17:11.861 --> 1:17:17.898
The film goal for this is to
just get it done, get it out
there, find its audience,

1:17:17.900 --> 1:17:24.038
and hopefully, uh,
find the people or person

1:17:24.674 --> 1:17:28.409
who likes it enough to wanna
help me make my next film,

1:17:28.411 --> 1:17:34.281
because the goal
is to, you know, always
be making another film.

1:17:34.283 --> 1:17:37.118
There's a lot of reasons to
make it for very little money.

1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:41.689
Um, we made this one
for next to nothing, and the--
the point with that was,

1:17:41.691 --> 1:17:45.960
A, total control, B,
go anywhere you want,
shoot anything you want--

1:17:45.962 --> 1:17:51.699
We have almost no, you know,
no crew, no overhead,
we keep it very, um...

1:17:51.701 --> 1:17:53.334
stripped down to the bone.

1:17:53.336 --> 1:17:58.906
And, uh, that allows for a,
great artistic freedom, and um,

1:17:58.908 --> 1:18:04.378
I think nowadays, um,
quantity equals quality.

1:18:04.380 --> 1:18:07.882
Not in the sense
that if you do more
it's automatically better,

1:18:08.217 --> 1:18:12.987
but in the sense that more
is better, in this day and age.

1:18:12.989 --> 1:18:15.189
It helps you get seen more,

1:18:15.191 --> 1:18:18.893
uh, people like to see that
you've done more, um, and--

1:18:18.895 --> 1:18:21.996
and, I do think, though, that
it is true, that the more
you do, the better you get.

1:18:21.998 --> 1:18:26.000
So if you're -- if you have
no talent, and you're
never gonna be great,

1:18:26.002 --> 1:18:31.906
even your, you know,
whatever's your best, is gonna
improve by doing more.

1:18:31.908 --> 1:18:34.909
Because you'll be quicker
at it, even if it's
quicker at being bad,

1:18:34.911 --> 1:18:39.113
and more efficient at being bad,
or whatever it is that you're
doing poorly, you know,

1:18:39.115 --> 1:18:42.617
you'll be able to do it better.

1:18:42.618 --> 1:18:46.120
Um, and if you do have talent,
and you have some sort
of growth going on,

1:18:46.122 --> 1:18:48.322
then it-- more will help
you improve there.

1:18:48.324 --> 1:18:51.092
So it's not...

1:18:51.093 --> 1:18:53.861
It-- it's -- but what I'm not
saying is, just by having
more, you're better,

1:18:53.863 --> 1:18:57.932
but, in this day and age,
in this environment
that we-- that we, uh--

1:18:57.934 --> 1:19:03.137
uh, are-- are in, in this
atmosphere of filmmaking,
I do believe that, uh,

1:19:03.139 --> 1:19:06.073
more is better, and
to have more to show...

1:19:06.075 --> 1:19:08.993
And, I also believe
that work begets work,

1:19:08.994 --> 1:19:11.912
and I don't like to sit
around and wait, so, some
films I make for more money,

1:19:11.914 --> 1:19:14.014
and then other films
I make for no money

1:19:14.016 --> 1:19:17.051
because I just, have to make
the next one, but, um...

1:19:17.053 --> 1:19:19.386
That's really why we made
this one, for no money,

1:19:19.388 --> 1:19:23.023
uh-- or not no money, but
very little money, and, uh--

1:19:23.025 --> 1:19:27.495
it-- again, it really allows us
to, or myself to express,

1:19:27.497 --> 1:19:33.467
wholeheartedly, um,
what I want to express, um...

1:19:34.203 --> 1:19:36.971
Yeah. Uh, also,
you know, it's...

1:19:36.973 --> 1:19:42.543
This film was-- was fun
because, uh, it-- it,
the -- New York plays,

1:19:43.513 --> 1:19:49.984
you know, not just as big a
character as the characters in
the film, it often plays bigger.

1:19:49.986 --> 1:19:53.004
You know, uh.

1:19:53.005 --> 1:19:56.023
There was a lot of New York
in this, and that was very
exciting to me, and uh...

1:19:56.025 --> 1:20:00.261
You can't just do that with--
with a bigger budget,

1:20:00.263 --> 1:20:06.100
and where you're, um,
beholden to investors
and such, so... Um...

1:20:06.102 --> 1:20:09.136
Uh, again, it's freedom--
really it's freedom.

1:20:09.138 --> 1:20:11.338
And to continue working, uh--

1:20:11.340 --> 1:20:16.577
uh, so that maybe my work
will help me get more
work, so-- yeah...

1:20:16.579 --> 1:20:19.346
Anyway, umm, are we done? Can--

1:20:20.116 --> 1:20:21.348
Can I go? I kind of have to,

1:20:21.851 --> 1:20:24.485
I got a thing with a guy
and uh... doodle...

1:20:25.354 --> 1:20:26.854
Alright. Thank you.

1:20:27.857 --> 1:20:28.355
Cut.

1:20:30.593 --> 1:20:33.427
