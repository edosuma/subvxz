Previously on Continuum...

00:03.087 --> 00:04.588
Who killed me?

00:05.131 --> 00:07.247
SCAR ALEC: I’m the one
that risked everything
to come back for you.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.718
He doesn't know, but
I'm leaving that decision
up to you, okay?

00:09.802 --> 00:11.133
You're in control.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.461
KIERA: The dead man tells me
I’m going to get some answers.

00:13.556 --> 00:16.298
Curtis is of the opinion
I'm wasting my time
with you.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.008
Okay, I'll keep working
on the CMR playback
of your murder remotely.

00:19.228 --> 00:20.604
Don't worry, Kiera,
we'll find your killer.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.272
ALEC: linherited Piron.

00:23.566 --> 00:26.603

is a feeble instrument.

00:26.861 --> 00:28.601
EMILY: You haven't met
that part of yourself yet.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.902
The part that will do
anything to survive.

00:31.032 --> 00:33.114
lt's him.
When did I become
such a dick?

00:33.242 --> 00:35.198
KIERA: / needed to protect you
and / thought...

00:36.704 --> 00:39.116
but you scratch that
protection and it's
self-interest underneath.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.952
KIERA: Alec, ltrust you.
The other one betrayed me.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.075
Why are you here?
Emily.

00:44.295 --> 00:45.785

01:28.506 --> 01:31.248
It's okay, Kiera.

You know you can, please.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.815
You just have to be brave.

01:58.077 --> 02:00.693
I know what you're asking.
I can't.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.748
Don't.
The remedy is on its way.

Don't lie to me.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.719

03:24.955 --> 03:27.697
This is the holy

of "does not compute."

03:28.292 --> 03:29.657
Okay, well,
what's the basic problem?

03:29.752 --> 03:31.538
Well, besides the heavily
damaged stream, let's see,

03:31.629 --> 03:34.917
we have software-interpolating
noise as signal,
signal as gack.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.794
Two identical CMR's stacked
on top of each other,

03:37.968 --> 03:40.254
so the program thinks
it's impossible, which it is.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.507
The analytical algorithms
keep throwing up.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.008
I'm looking over
my shoulder every day

03:44.100 --> 03:45.840
for someone who might
want to kill me twice.

03:46.102 --> 03:48.309
If I could go any faster, I...

03:48.562 --> 03:49.972
I mean, really,
why wouldn't I?

03:50.981 --> 03:52.892
I'm sorry.
You're right.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.830
Yeah, for now.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.125
What if time self-corrects?

04:12.044 --> 04:13.750
I mean, not to get all
Rod Serling over here,

04:13.838 --> 04:16.921
but what if all I've done
was just throw in a few
more people into the gears

04:17.007 --> 04:18.167
while playing God?

04:19.718 --> 04:21.219
You know
I have to leave, Kiera.

04:21.679 --> 04:23.169
Me and Emily.
lt's...

04:23.347 --> 04:24.382
It's the only option.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.304
Where will you go?
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

04:26.392 --> 04:28.178
ljust... I don't want
to become that Alec.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.510
ldon't want to be
like him in 2077.

04:30.855 --> 04:32.391
I can't keep
hurting people.

04:33.524 --> 04:34.684
Thats

04:36.735 --> 04:38.020
good to know.

04:38.863 --> 04:40.694
You know, sometimes
you look at me

horror movie chill.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.232
(CHUCKLES)

04:49.540 --> 04:50.780
I'll make sure everything
keeps running

04:50.875 --> 04:53.491
and have it uploaded
to your CMR directly
once it's finished.

04:55.546 --> 04:56.752
Thanks.

05:00.384 --> 05:01.999
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

05:10.686 --> 05:13.393
It's like listening
to 16 channels at once.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.305
Well, maybe
he's not as important
as you think.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.736
He is important.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.569
His revelation...
CURTIS: Was a miss.

05:24.033 --> 05:25.898
He knew nothing
about Cameron joining us,

05:25.993 --> 05:28.450
so how much
of a revelation was it?

05:29.872 --> 05:30.907
How useful is he?

05:31.081 --> 05:33.458
Until we understand
what's inside him,

05:33.542 --> 05:35.498
he's not going anywhere.

05:38.255 --> 05:42.214
From the moment you arrived
we both knew the task
you'd been set.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.754
I've been patient.

05:45.221 --> 05:47.428
Hopeful that the path
would reveal itself.

05:47.848 --> 05:48.928
It hasn't.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.511
Yet the continuum
must be preserved.

05:52.228 --> 05:55.720
You know firsthand
the consequences
of an unstable timeline.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.186
You have to choose
now.
I need more time.

05:59.777 --> 06:00.766
Just”

06:00.986 --> 06:03.602
Just a little more time.
You're bargaining, Kiera.

06:04.073 --> 06:06.940
The damage to the timeline
can ripple out slowly,

06:07.284 --> 06:10.776
but we must act before
that ripple becomes a storm.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.116
And act decisively.

06:13.958 --> 06:16.665
Without mercy, you mean.
No, Kiera.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.790
With mercy.
And compassion.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.788
For all those who
will be affected.

06:22.925 --> 06:25.587
You are talking
about killing Alec.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.131
And an Alec.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.472
You want certainty.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.301
Facts that prove
you're making
the right choice.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.102
We don't have that.

06:37.982 --> 06:39.722
But there's a sense.

06:41.110 --> 06:44.352
There's a clarity
that comes.
You guess.

06:44.989 --> 06:47.480
We rely on science
as much as we can,

06:48.325 --> 06:51.158
but faith always plays
its part in the end.

06:54.832 --> 06:56.993
Whether he pulled
the trigger or not,

06:57.084 --> 07:00.076
time traveling Alec Sadler
caused your death.

07:02.339 --> 07:05.422
His actions led
to the murder of Escher,
his own father.

07:05.676 --> 07:08.463
Alec is ready to renounce
his future.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.178
Escape with Emily
and never come back.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.088
Wouldn't that suffice?

07:13.183 --> 07:14.889
Does that sound
like the Alec Sadler

07:14.977 --> 07:17.514
who ensures our future
comes to pass?

07:19.148 --> 07:21.139
Rejoice, Kiera!

07:22.359 --> 07:24.270
He's making the decision
for you.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.404
Now is the time,

07:32.202 --> 07:34.909
but if you feel
you can't handle this...

07:45.883 --> 07:47.464
It's a terrible idea.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.968
Kellog has money
and resources
and he's shady as hell.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.511
He'll know how to help
us disappear.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.884
He's never helped anyone
where it didn't benefit
him more.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.218
What are you gonna
have to do for him?

07:59.313 --> 08:00.974
Whatever it takes.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.436
Don't say that.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.318
You make a handshake deal
with Matthew Kellog,

08:08.405 --> 08:10.191
better make sure you have
all your fingers afterwards.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.235
You're overstating it.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.784
We need to get Escher's
file on me before
we go anywhere.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.411
If we can go anywhere.

08:21.585 --> 08:24.372
He had me under his thumb.
I don't want to give
the other guy that power.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.044
He's already leaked
some of your files
to the VPD.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.837
How much more
could there be?

08:31.553 --> 08:32.588
Oh.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.255
Let's go in the dark net.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.430
Find a way there.

08:37.810 --> 08:40.597
No offense, but at least
Kellog is a devil I know.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.436
There's no way in hell
I'm poking under that rock.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.268
You come up
with something then.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.056
You got papers?

09:36.160 --> 09:37.491
Thank you.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.134

It's what we're here for.

Hey, you two.

There is a chemical leak!
You have to evacuate
right now... Whoa!

10:56.240 --> 10:58.947
Leave.
Okay man, take it easy!
I'm sorry!

10:59.034 --> 11:00.069

Lucas, we're inbound
with the payload.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.296
This is Jim at Gate B.
We have a truck
approaching quickly.

11:18.971 --> 11:21.212
I need assistance!
I repeat, I need assistance!

11:21.306 --> 11:22.295
Whoa!

11:34.945 --> 11:38.563
80, security camera's
footage positively ID'd
Travis Verta.

11:39.283 --> 11:42.616
It was like, he wanted
to be sure that we knew
it was him.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.449
What would Liber8 want
with a truck full
of Sonmanto chemicals?

11:46.957 --> 11:48.242
Maybe they're back
in the drug game.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.449
They changed tack
and gained ground.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.375
Why switch up
the Robin Hood act now?

11:52.504 --> 11:54.836
I don't know.
Bet you 20 bucks it has
something to do with this guy.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.794
KIERA: Mr. Richardson!
Surprised to see
you here.

11:58.135 --> 12:02.128
And I'm surprised to see
VPD's Terrorist Task Force
responding to a false alarm.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.220
Liber8 infiltrates
a chemical plant

12:06.768 --> 12:08.474
Oh, yeah,
nothing suspicious there.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.307
Nothing was stolen.
Just like the safety
deposit boxes?

12:12.524 --> 12:15.140
Our staff has already
conducted an extensive
inventory.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.391
Nothing's missing.

12:16.486 --> 12:19.694
And security has confirmed
not a single sensitive area
was breached.

12:20.324 --> 12:22.781
Yeah, well,
we'll still need
to investigate.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.153
We can start
with the witnesses.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.322
I expect no less.

12:33.295 --> 12:34.330
Hey, Betty.

12:34.546 --> 12:37.413
Hey, check and see
if any tanker trucks
have been reported stolen.

12:37.841 --> 12:40.503
Mr. Richardson tells us
you surprised
the thieves.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.087
That's correct.

12:42.596 --> 12:45.588
They pulled in,
I realized their papers
were falsified

12:45.682 --> 12:47.468
and I rang the alarm.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.100
Then why were you wearing
a gas mask?

12:55.734 --> 12:59.101
It was a stressful
situation. We gave him
some oxygen.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.653
Now, ifyou have
no further questions...

13:01.990 --> 13:03.776
Do you have any idea
what they were after?

13:05.202 --> 13:06.612
Fortunately,
for all of us,

13:06.703 --> 13:09.365
there's nothing here
that would have been
useful to them.

13:10.207 --> 13:12.664
And I think Frank here
has been through enough.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.032
You're right.

13:14.753 --> 13:15.993
I apologize.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.671
If you think
of anything else.

13:21.677 --> 13:23.508
Now I'd like to see
those tanks.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.673
(SIGHS) Of course.

13:29.643 --> 13:33.227
ALEC: HALO will take
Piron to the next level.
It will change everything!

13:33.397 --> 13:35.604
It's like a health monitor,

13:36.066 --> 13:37.397
but it's so much
more than that.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.649
You wear it on your wrist
and it can tell you
everything.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.852
I mean,
it can tell you if...

13:46.243 --> 13:48.234
It's all right.
Just wait a second.

13:50.414 --> 13:52.530
You said you never wanted
to see me again.

13:52.624 --> 13:53.613
I'm trying to make sure
you don't.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.666
Convicted felons
can't travel
internationally.

13:56.878 --> 13:59.369
They can when wounded
ex-boyfriends get out
of their way.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.256
How is life with
the romantic
time-traveling me?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.675
Enjoying your stay
at the honeymoon suite
at the Bedbug Motel?

14:07.764 --> 14:09.675
Do you know which
one of us you're punishing?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.306
I like you on a leash,
Emily.

Mr. Richardson,
what's in these tanks?

15:05.113 --> 15:07.604
Uh, waste.
We ship it out bi-weekly.

15:08.366 --> 15:09.617
What kind of waste?

15:09.868 --> 15:13.076
By-product of an experimental
high-yield agent.
It's completely benign.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.320
Would you like
the patent number?

15:15.415 --> 15:17.030
Is it included
in your inventory?

15:17.501 --> 15:18.661
No.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.994
There are a couple
of apple cores probably
in recycling box two,

15:22.089 --> 15:23.875

being thorough.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.008

I'm gonna need to see

15:29.096 --> 15:30.882

from the break-in.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.263

These chemicals that
you found, the waste,

if it's mixed with
hydrogen sulfide gas
and manganese dioxide,

16:58.602 --> 17:00.593

could be catastrophic.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.352
Are these compounds
hard to get?

Not at all. Ifyou can't
buy straight-up
sulfide dioxide,

17:05.108 --> 17:07.645
you can make it
with insect repellant
and toilet cleaner.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.026
Manganese dioxide
is found in most
household batteries.

17:10.405 --> 17:13.112

20:15.590 --> 20:17.706
Yeah. I know.
I asked you to look
into that truck

20:17.801 --> 20:18.881
two and a half hours ago.

20:19.010 --> 20:22.093

All right, that's it.

28:55.902 --> 28:57.438
No, hold on.
Let's see what he's up to.

28:57.612 --> 28:59.273
Inside this truck,

29:00.907 --> 29:03.193
is a chemical waste
by-product.

29:03.826 --> 29:07.364
Although you wouldn't
want to spread it
on your vegetable patch,

29:07.496 --> 29:09.987
in its current state,
it's benign.

29:10.833 --> 29:14.451
But if you simply
add a few common household
chemicals

29:14.587 --> 29:17.829
to this Sonmanto drudge,

29:18.341 --> 29:22.835
it becomes a poisonous gas
that could be used
in chemical attacks.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.885
Easy, Agent Cameron.
You don't want to...

29:24.972 --> 29:27.509
Oh! You getting this?
I have a message for you.

29:27.934 --> 29:31.768
They said you would know,
and I quote, "the future
ramifications of this."

29:31.854 --> 29:33.060
You're an errand boy
for terrorists.

29:33.147 --> 29:35.058
Liber8 wants you
all to know

29:35.149 --> 29:37.936
that Sonmanto
is creating
a dangerous weapon

29:38.027 --> 29:39.983
for use
in a chemical attack!
That is Liber8's handiwork!

29:40.071 --> 29:43.359
Sonmanto is well aware
of the potential
for weaponization.

29:43.491 --> 29:45.573
In fact, they're already
profiting from this stuff.

29:45.660 --> 29:47.742
Let's get Mr. Solomon
out of here

29:47.828 --> 29:49.534
and please,
let's move
the press back.

29:49.622 --> 29:51.203
Can these accusations
be proven?

29:51.290 --> 29:52.996
You're the so-called
free press!

29:53.084 --> 29:54.119
Find out for yourselves!

29:54.627 --> 29:57.289
SOLOMON: Liber8 believes
in freedom of information.

29:57.380 --> 30:00.213
Stand down.
SOLOMON: Freedom
of information.

30:06.013 --> 30:07.514
Hey, you okay?

30:08.891 --> 30:11.974
I survived the warehouse
because I'm immunized.

30:12.979 --> 30:14.594
Tens of thousands of people.

30:15.815 --> 30:19.148
My friends died
in agony.

30:21.237 --> 30:23.228
Sonmanto created the cure.

30:25.825 --> 30:28.237
Don't tell me
they also made the...

30:31.414 --> 30:33.029
Let's get you
out of here.

30:36.544 --> 30:40.378
I was in combat
when that chemical
was used against my platoon.

30:42.008 --> 30:45.921
It was the most
excruciating pain
I've ever felt.

30:47.888 --> 30:51.096
And Sonmanto saved me
when I thought
I was past saving.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.721
Liber8 knows that.

31:00.026 --> 31:02.312
But they think
they know something more.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.361
Remember when
Richardson insisted

31:05.448 --> 31:08.611
that Sonmanto hadn't
lost anything in those
safety deposit heists?

31:10.870 --> 31:15.113
Well, what if this
kind of information
is exactly what they lost?

31:15.791 --> 31:16.871
What do you mean?

31:17.209 --> 31:21.168
Well, corporations spy
on other corporations
all the time, right?

31:21.922 --> 31:23.753
Well, Liber8 broke
into those boxes.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.166
What if they stole
all that espionage?

31:28.763 --> 31:31.175
It would explain
why they went after
the Fermitas server as well.

31:31.307 --> 31:34.970
In this time,
companies are still
in competition.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.472
There is no
Corporate Congress.

31:37.646 --> 31:39.261
That's what Liber8
is trying to stop.

31:39.648 --> 31:40.637
(SCOFFS)

31:41.525 --> 31:42.901
And we can't prove
any of it.

31:43.527 --> 31:44.983
Hold on. Alec?

31:47.615 --> 31:49.651
KIERA: It’s about
chemical waste.

31:55.164 --> 31:56.574
(SIGHS) What about it?

31:56.665 --> 31:59.452
Is there any way
to find out if Sonmanto
has weaponized it?

31:59.543 --> 32:00.999
I thought you needed a cure?

32:01.504 --> 32:02.619
I need both.

32:03.130 --> 32:04.631
But you can wait
forthis though, right?

32:04.715 --> 32:07.047
You mean wait until
it's actually used
on somebody?

32:09.011 --> 32:10.547
All right, let's see.

32:12.848 --> 32:13.928
Wow!

32:14.433 --> 32:17.095
It's like Spy vs. Spy.
Piron has files
on everyone here.

32:17.353 --> 32:19.719
Anything on
Derek Richardson
or Sonmanto?

32:20.022 --> 32:21.353
Let me see.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.228
Richardson went to Dubai.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.687
Oh, wow.

32:30.533 --> 32:33.195
Uh, you're gonna want
to read this, though.
I'll send it to your CMR.

32:33.369 --> 32:36.657
Can you send it
to Carlos as well?
Yeah, you got it.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.164
You asshole.

32:42.336 --> 32:43.951
You can't stop
stealing from me.

32:44.296 --> 32:47.288
ALEC: First you steal my life,
now you’re stealing my files?
Alec?

32:49.343 --> 32:50.423
Alec?

32:51.554 --> 32:53.135
SCAR ALEC: Back off!
Carlos, I have to go.

32:53.389 --> 32:54.469
Yeah.

32:57.518 --> 32:58.849
Holy shit.

32:59.895 --> 33:02.386
We've got Liber8
calling us the bad guys.

33:02.565 --> 33:05.602
It's like we're in...
What's that
Superman thing?

33:05.818 --> 33:07.308
Bizarro World.

33:07.570 --> 33:09.401
Where good is bad,
bad is good.

33:09.488 --> 33:10.864
That's it, Detective.

33:11.031 --> 33:12.111
But in this world,

33:12.324 --> 33:13.985
you said your company
had no idea

33:14.076 --> 33:17.239
about the possible
weaponization of your
waste material.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.781
That's right.

33:19.081 --> 33:22.994
Then, why were you meeting
with Chechen separatists
in Dubai three months ago?

33:23.586 --> 33:26.578
I was in Dubai for a
bioengineering conference.

33:27.047 --> 33:28.503
And I had
no such meetings.

33:28.591 --> 33:31.674
So, cryptic
communication between
you and Jihadi leadership?

33:31.760 --> 33:32.795
That's not true either?

33:32.928 --> 33:34.304
(REPORTERS CHATTERING)

33:34.638 --> 33:36.174
Definitely not.

33:37.433 --> 33:40.140
When were you planning
on selling the antidote?

33:40.269 --> 33:41.930
Or were you just gonna
hold out for
a better price?

33:42.104 --> 33:45.767
You are siding with terrorists
and their lies, Officer.
I'm siding with the truth.

33:46.233 --> 33:48.440
For once, Liber8 did
a little good.

33:48.611 --> 33:51.523
They lifted up the mat,
and you crawled out.

33:51.989 --> 33:53.479
I'm taking you in.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.943
What are you taking
from me now?

33:56.118 --> 33:57.904
All you have to do
is let us go.

33:58.078 --> 33:59.204
I'm not stopping you.

33:59.288 --> 34:01.825
Emily has a warrant.
She can't leave
because of it.

34:01.957 --> 34:05.324
I can't have any access
to my bank accounts.
My accounts!

34:05.544 --> 34:07.000
We can't get passports.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.870
And it's against
the law to get
a fake passport.

34:13.052 --> 34:15.714
Look at you, what
she's turned you into.
This isn't us.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.553
Look, just let me walk
out of here.

34:18.474 --> 34:20.556
It's gonna be
impossible to
explain anything else.

34:20.643 --> 34:22.133
Well, it seems possible
to explain anything

when you have enough
power and money.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.728
You idiot!

34:27.900 --> 34:29.231
You're still in love
with Emily.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.017
Hardly.

34:31.195 --> 34:34.483
I can access every file
in your directory
except for the one on her.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.531
You have her locked up
tight, so yeah, you are.

34:39.161 --> 34:40.492
But she's done with you.

you're some better
version of me?

from having you taken away.

No.

kind of people.

what kind of people
I am.

gonna get out of here.

and he trapped me.

Is he dead?
Sedated.

out of here
quickly and covertly.

do with him?

you again.

Yeah, I'm good with that.

Maybe.

and the crown attorney
has a shallow sack.

are criminals.

immediate problem
with that shit-storm

that you created
in front of the press.

Don't you mean
Kiera's shit-storm?

accused you of siding
with Liber8,

36:52.294 --> 36:54.285
he queued up the
leading sound bite
for tonight's news.

But that's how
it's gonna look.

on some paperwork while we
wait out this news cycle.

had me fooled.

of the victory.

as the hero.

gonna be making

released a remedy for 16,

him to me?

You wanted him neutralized.

40:07.322 --> 40:08.823
I got him off the street.

40:09.324 --> 40:11.030
He doesn't have to die.

40:12.494 --> 40:14.485
Then you're sure
this is the right choice?

40:16.206 --> 40:19.323
He's admitted he doesn't
want to pursue his destiny.

40:20.502 --> 40:22.288
He's turned violent.

40:23.297 --> 40:24.412

are hard, Kiera,

but eventually we all
have to make them.

There is a big difference
between sacrifice
and betrayal.

40:50.657 --> 40:53.490
We may not have been
seeing eye-to-eye,

40:55.370 --> 40:56.871
but I just betrayed my friend.

you first.

more often.

we're done?

sealing a trust.

soon enough.
