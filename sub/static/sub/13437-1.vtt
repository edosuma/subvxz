EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

01:46.583 --> 01:49.000

THIS IS COWBOY

03:00.709 --> 03:02.083
WITH YOUR WELL-BEING REPORT.

03:02.083 --> 03:04.375

LIKE THAT AGAIN.

03:04.375 --> 03:06.041
- KID'S DOWN, SAFE,
PROBABLY GONNA BE GROUNDED

03:06.041 --> 03:07.375
FOR A WHILE.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.375
- ROGER THAT, COWBOY.

03:09.375 --> 03:11.375
SAFE TRAVELS.

03:18.917 --> 03:20.750
- JENNY...

03:20.750 --> 03:23.834
I NEED YOU FOR TEN.

03:28.083 --> 03:31.000
- OKAY, JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
PUT TOO MUCH OR THEY'LL NOTICE.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.458
- THIS'LL GET 'EM.

03:32.458 --> 03:34.458
BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO HIDE OUT
AT MY PLACE TONIGHT.

03:34.458 --> 03:37.000
- BUT YOU FORGET,
I GOT A BLIND DATE TONIGHT.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.834
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
WEDNESDAY.

03:38.834 --> 03:40.667
- YEAH.

03:40.667 --> 03:43.041
YVONNE PROMISED
SHE'S A LOOKER.

03:43.041 --> 03:45.583
- YEAH, WELL, I DO TRUST
YOUR WIFE'S TASTE.

03:45.583 --> 03:49.750
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM,
I KNOW WHERE TO FIND YOU.

04:11.625 --> 04:13.834
IT'S THE HOTTEST SAUCE
ON EARTH!

04:22.834 --> 04:27.166
- THERE'S--THERE'S NO WAY
TO SUGARCOAT THIS.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.625
LET ME START WITH A POSITIVE.

04:28.625 --> 04:32.208
NO JOBS ARE BEING ELIMINATED.
- BUT?

04:32.208 --> 04:34.709
- EVERYBODY'S GETTING A CUT
IN HOURS,

04:34.709 --> 04:37.041
MANDATORY FURLOUGH DAY
ONCE A WEEK,

04:37.041 --> 04:41.083
AT LEAST UNTIL THE END
OF THIS FISCAL YEAR.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.583
- AND THEN I'LL GO BACK
TO FULL-TIME?

04:42.583 --> 04:45.542
- AS LONG AS THE COUNTY BUDGET
LOOSENS UP.

04:45.542 --> 04:47.333
- I HAVE KIDS, BILL.

04:47.333 --> 04:51.583
- JENNY, I SQUEEZED THEM
AS HARD AS I COULD.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.208
- YOU KNOW IN ALL THE TIME
I'VE WORKED HERE

04:53.208 --> 04:54.542
THE FOUR WORDS
I'VE NEVER HEARD?

04:54.542 --> 04:59.208
- WHAT?
- "COUNTY BUDGET'S LOOSENED UP."

05:00.750 --> 05:03.375
- WE MET AT PABLO'S.

05:03.375 --> 05:06.041
I WAS WITH YVONNE.

05:06.041 --> 05:09.041
- I'M SORRY.
I JUST--I DON'T REMEMBER.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.583
- WELL, MY HAIR
WAS MUCH LONGER THEN.

05:10.583 --> 05:12.291
IT WAS, LIKE, TO HERE,
BUT THEN I CUT IT.

05:12.291 --> 05:15.166
WELL, I DIDN'T CUT IT.
SOMEONE CUT IT FOR ME.

05:15.166 --> 05:16.750
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT TO SAY.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.458
- YEAH.
IT LOOKS NICE.

05:29.250 --> 05:32.250
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
- YOU DO?

05:32.250 --> 05:34.875
- YEP. THAT'S ONE THING
YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ME.

05:34.875 --> 05:36.875
I'M "TELEPATHICAL."

05:36.875 --> 05:37.959
- YOU ARE?

05:37.959 --> 05:41.250
- MM-HMM.
- WHAT AM I THINKING?

05:43.959 --> 05:47.250
- DENTAL HYGIENIST, NO.

05:47.250 --> 05:51.250
WEB PROGRAMMER, NO.

05:51.250 --> 05:54.750
"BEAUTICIAN,
FIVE YEARS EXPERIENCE,

05:54.750 --> 05:56.792
MUST HAVE ONGOING CLIENTELE."

05:56.792 --> 06:00.166
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

06:20.250 --> 06:22.625
- EXCUSE ME.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.333
- COME IN.

06:29.333 --> 06:32.000
- EVENING, CHIEF.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.500
I BROUGHT YOU A DOGGIE BAG.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.375
- OH, YEAH?

06:35.375 --> 06:37.458
WELL, WHAT WAS SHE--

06:37.458 --> 06:39.166
TOO TALL,

06:39.166 --> 06:42.458
TOO BLONDE, TOO THIN?

06:42.458 --> 06:43.667
- TOO "TELEPATHICAL."

06:43.667 --> 06:46.166
- IS THAT A WORD?

06:46.166 --> 06:48.542
- YOU KNOW, I THINK I COULD BE
IN SOME TROUBLE.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.125
- WHAT THIS TIME?

06:50.125 --> 06:51.625
- A LITTLE TABASCO
IN THE OREOS.

06:51.625 --> 06:54.208
- BETTER WATCH YOUR BACK.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.875
PAYBACK'S COMING.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.709
- YEAH, I WAS AFRAID
YOU WERE GONNA SAY THAT.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.208
- YEAH.

07:00.667 --> 07:03.458
- CHECK.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.458
- WHAT?

07:25.834 --> 07:30.208
- WHAT'S WRONG?

07:30.208 --> 07:31.834
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
SOMETHING'S WRONG?

07:31.834 --> 07:34.417
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE
JUST STANDING THERE,

07:34.417 --> 07:36.709
STARING OFF INTO SPACE.

07:36.709 --> 07:37.917
- I'M JUST THINKING.

07:37.917 --> 07:39.375
- OH, NO.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.834
- MOM, WE HATE IT
WHEN YOU THINK.

07:40.834 --> 07:42.542
- COME ON, GUYS.

07:42.542 --> 07:44.041
- WE'RE NOT LITTLE KIDS.

07:44.041 --> 07:46.166
JUST SAY IT.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.709
- OKAY.

07:51.709 --> 07:53.542
I'M THINKING ABOUT RENTING OUT
THE GUEST ROOM.

07:53.542 --> 07:55.417
- WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?

07:55.417 --> 07:58.500
- WELL, BECAUSE MY HOURS
WERE CUT AT WORK,

07:58.500 --> 08:01.333
WHICH MEANS I'M GONNA BE MAKING
LESS MONEY,

08:01.333 --> 08:03.208
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE UP
THE DIFFERENCE SOMEHOW.

08:03.208 --> 08:05.667
- SO SOMEONE WOULD LIVE
WITH US?

08:05.667 --> 08:07.417
- THAT SOUNDS REALLY CREEPY.

08:07.417 --> 08:08.709
- IT WOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT--

08:08.709 --> 08:10.041
YOU KNOW,
NOT LIKE MEALS OR ANYTHING.

08:10.041 --> 08:11.250
JUST SOMEONE
TO RENT THE ROOM,

08:11.250 --> 08:13.125
SOMEONE WHO WOULDN'T BE HERE
THAT OFTEN.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.583
- DO WE GET
TO CHECK THEM OUT FIRST?

08:15.583 --> 08:17.583
- YES, OF COURSE.

08:17.583 --> 08:20.083
WE WILL TOTALLY
CHECK THEM OUT...

08:20.083 --> 08:21.875
TOGETHER.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.750
- HEY.
- YO, YO.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.750
- WHAT YOU GOT?
- JUST PREPPING.

08:34.750 --> 08:37.667
- THIS JUST IN FROM
THE "GOOD IDEA" DEPARTMENT--

08:37.667 --> 08:39.917
PLACING AN INCENDIARY DEVICE
IN A FIREFIGHTER'S MOUTH

08:39.917 --> 08:42.625
IS NOT RECOMMENDED.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.250
- OH!

08:44.250 --> 08:46.917
COME ON, GUYS.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.083
HEY!

08:59.291 --> 09:02.959
- OKAY, LET'S LIST
ALL THE GOOD FEATURES.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.458
- UM...

09:05.458 --> 09:07.500
COMES WITH A BED.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.959
- "SOFT BED."

09:08.959 --> 09:12.625
- WHAT ABOUT THE BATHROOM?
- "IN-SUITE BATH."

09:12.625 --> 09:14.166
- NEWLY REDECORATED.

09:14.166 --> 09:17.500
- THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.625
"RECENTLY RENOVATED."

09:20.625 --> 09:21.959
- MM.

09:21.959 --> 09:23.333
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:23.333 --> 09:26.000
I AM GONNA SEND THIS FLYER
AROUND TO THE COUNTY OFFICES.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.333
- GOOD.

09:30.667 --> 09:33.083
- YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

09:34.333 --> 09:36.083
- LET'S DO IT, GENTLEMEN.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.959
- ATTENTION, ENGINE 54,
RESPOND TO REPORT--

09:37.959 --> 09:40.959
SMOKE COMING FROM A RESIDENCE
AT 1012 LARKIN STREET.

09:40.959 --> 09:42.625
- LET'S GO.
LOAD IT UP, GUYS.

09:42.625 --> 09:45.500
- ENGINE 54,
RESPOND TO REPORT...

09:57.166 --> 09:59.166
- DISPATCH,
ENGINE 54 ON SCENE--

09:59.166 --> 10:02.458
SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING,
SMOKE COMING FROM DOOR.

10:02.458 --> 10:05.542
GUILLERMO, GET THE HALON.
- ROGER THAT.

10:05.542 --> 10:08.208
- GOING IN.
- RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.709
- OH!

10:13.125 --> 10:16.542
- WE GOT A FIREMAN DOWN!

10:16.542 --> 10:18.875
YOU OKAY?
WHERE'S IT HURT?

10:18.875 --> 10:22.709
- I'M OKAY. JUST GO INSIDE
AND SEE IF EVERYBODY'S OUT.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.792
- COME ON, GUYS,
MOVE IT, MOVE IT.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.166
COME ON.
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.375
- OPERATOR 23.

10:31.375 --> 10:33.041
- FIREMAN DOWN, 1012 LARKIN.

10:33.041 --> 10:35.333
- COWBOY?
- ROGER THAT, 23.

10:35.333 --> 10:36.834
- WHAT'S THE NATURE
OF HIS INJURIES?

10:36.834 --> 10:39.166
- IT'S ME. DOOR BLEW.
TOOK ME OUT.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.875
- I'VE GOT
THE PARAMEDICS ROLLING.

10:40.875 --> 10:44.041
THEY'LL BE THERE
ANY MINUTE.

10:56.250 --> 10:59.000
- SO IT WAS
A DISPLACED FRACTURE.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.375
WE GOT IT REALIGNED NICELY.

11:00.375 --> 11:03.458
- LIKE, REALIGNED
LIKE I'LL BE ABLE TO WALK?

11:03.458 --> 11:05.917
OR REALIGNED LIKE I'LL BE ABLE
TO CLIMB A LADDER AGAIN?

11:05.917 --> 11:07.709
- YOU'LL DEFINITELY BE ABLE
TO WALK AGAIN.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.834
- THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
- YOU WANT LADDERS?

11:09.834 --> 11:12.667
HERE'S YOUR BEST CHANCE--
NO WEIGHT-BEARING, NONE.

11:12.667 --> 11:15.750
AND THE FOOT DOESN'T TOUCH
THE FLOOR AND NO STAIRS.

11:15.750 --> 11:17.583
- MY CONDO'S
ON A THIRD-FLOOR WALK-UP.

11:17.583 --> 11:19.083
- AND NO STAIRS--NONE.

11:19.083 --> 11:21.083
CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY.

11:21.083 --> 11:24.083
- SURE THING.

11:29.041 --> 11:31.375
DO I LOOK LUCKY
TO YOU, MISS?

11:31.375 --> 11:32.959
- COWBOY?

11:36.458 --> 11:38.125
- 23?

11:38.125 --> 11:39.709
- THAT'S ME.

11:39.709 --> 11:42.625
- THE GUYS SEND YOU
OVER HERE?

11:42.625 --> 11:45.625
SO THIS IS LIKE A 10-21
UNPLUGGED?

11:45.625 --> 11:49.291
- YEAH.
LIKE THAT.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.792
HOW'S YOUR LEG?

11:50.792 --> 11:53.375
- IT'S LIKE A WHOLE
SPACE STATION IN THERE.

11:54.625 --> 11:57.291
- I BROUGHT YOU
APPLE BROWN BETTY.

11:59.542 --> 12:00.959
- THANK YOU.

12:02.959 --> 12:05.792
911'S GETTING MUCH BETTER
WITH THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.625
I JUST FELT BAD--

12:08.625 --> 12:12.041
YOU KNOW, A RESCUE WORKER
INJURED ON THE JOB.

12:12.041 --> 12:15.291
- HEY, YOU WANT TO STAY
FOR A MINUTE?

12:15.291 --> 12:17.166
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T WE DIG IN?

12:17.166 --> 12:19.125
I'LL GET A COUPLE FORKS
SENT UP.

12:19.125 --> 12:21.041
- THANK YOU,
BUT I CAN'T STAY.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.166
I HAVE TO GO TO A THING.

12:22.166 --> 12:24.500
- A THING?
WHAT KIND OF THING?

12:24.500 --> 12:26.834
- I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW...

12:26.834 --> 12:27.834
JUST A THING.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.667
- OKAY.

12:29.667 --> 12:32.959
HAVE FUN
AT YOUR THING, 23.

12:32.959 --> 12:34.667
- GET BETTER SOON, COWBOY.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.000
- UH, PLATE.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.500
HOW DO I GET
YOUR PLATE BACK TO YOU?

12:41.208 --> 12:43.208
- UM...

12:45.667 --> 12:48.458
IT HAS MY NUMBER ON IT.

13:08.166 --> 13:11.583
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
OUR RENTER WILL BE LIKE?

13:11.583 --> 13:13.750
- IT MIGHT BE AN EVIL GENIUS

13:13.750 --> 13:15.709
LIKE BATMAN'S ARCHENEMY,
THE JOKER.

13:15.709 --> 13:17.417
HE'LL SMILE AT US,

13:17.417 --> 13:19.583
BUT STILL BE PLOTTING
OUR DEMISE.

13:19.583 --> 13:22.041
- WHY DON'T WE JUST TELL HER
SHE CAN KEEP OUR ALLOWANCE?

13:22.041 --> 13:23.875
THAT WAY, SHE WON'T HAVE
TO RENT THE ROOM.

13:23.875 --> 13:26.667
- IT'S NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.083
- THEN WE'LL NEED JOBS.

13:28.083 --> 13:32.667
- NO ONE'S GONNA HIRE US
FOR REAL JOBS.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.709
- PEOPLE WITH DIRTY CARS WILL.

13:34.709 --> 13:37.083
- NAH. WHERE ARE WE GONNA GET
THE MONEY FOR THAT--

13:37.083 --> 13:40.625
DETERGENT, SPONGES,
BUCKETS?

13:40.625 --> 13:43.250
- WE'LL WASH
SOMETHING ELSE...

13:43.250 --> 13:44.750
DOGS.

13:44.750 --> 13:47.041
- OH, YEAH,
'CAUSE THAT'LL BE EASIER.

13:47.041 --> 13:49.458
- WHY DON'T YOU HELP COME UP
WITH IDEAS

13:49.458 --> 13:51.917
INSTEAD OF JUST CRITICIZING?

13:54.917 --> 13:58.417
- SO THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

14:02.792 --> 14:04.166
- NO.

14:04.166 --> 14:06.000
- MOM, SHE SQUEEZED
MY CHEEKS SO HARD,

14:06.000 --> 14:07.834
I THOUGHT
THEY'D FREEZE IN A PUCKER.

14:07.834 --> 14:09.291
- I KNOW.
I KNOW.

14:15.917 --> 14:17.625
- COWBOY.
- HI, 23.

14:17.625 --> 14:20.417
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
GUILLERMO.

14:20.417 --> 14:23.291
AND THIS IS YOUR PLATE.

14:23.291 --> 14:25.458
- OH, THANKS.

14:25.458 --> 14:27.750
- YOU'RE 23?
- DO YOU WANT TO COME IN?

14:27.750 --> 14:31.000
- WHY DO THEY
KEEP CALLING YOU 23?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.250
- YOU'RE A COWBOY?

14:32.250 --> 14:33.500
- NOT A REAL ONE.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.166
- COWBOY, HAVE A SEAT,
PLEASE.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.333
- THANK YOU.

14:36.333 --> 14:39.083
- YOU GUYS KNOW EACH OTHER?

14:41.291 --> 14:43.583
- LOOK, I-I WANTED
TO PROPOSE AN IDEA.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.458
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY YES.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.500
YOU CAN JUST SAY NO, AND YOU
DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME WHY.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.625
- OKAY.
- I'D LIKE TO RENT YOUR ROOM...

14:51.625 --> 14:53.250
JUST TEMPORARILY.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.208
- PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE HOMELESS.

14:55.208 --> 14:57.333
NO STAIRS--DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.667
I VE
IN A THIRD-STORY WALK-UP,

14:59.667 --> 15:01.458
AND YOUR FRONT PORCH
IS ABOUT THE BEST THING

15:01.458 --> 15:03.375
I CAN DO RIGHT NOW.
- IT'S JUST ONE ROOM.

15:03.375 --> 15:06.458
- NO, THAT'S FINE.
IT'S ALL I NEED.

15:06.458 --> 15:08.834
I'LL BE HAPPY TO PAY CASH FOR
THE FIRST MONTH'S RENT UP FRONT.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.667
- UM...

15:13.834 --> 15:15.458
- YOU HAVE THE 3-D VERSION?

15:15.458 --> 15:17.500
THAT'S AWESOME.
- YOU PLAY?

15:17.500 --> 15:18.959
- YEAH.
- WHAT LEVEL ARE YOU ON?

15:18.959 --> 15:20.625
- JUST GOT TO SEVEN.

15:20.625 --> 15:22.000
- HE'S GOT
THE WHOLE FIREHOUSE PLAYING IT.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.458
- YOU GOT PAST THE MINOTAUR?

15:23.458 --> 15:24.542
- YEAH.
YOU GOT TO DROP THE GOLD.

15:24.542 --> 15:26.333
THAT WAY,
YOU CAN JUMP OVER THE FIRE TRAP.

15:26.333 --> 15:29.000
- DROP THE GOLD--
OF COURSE.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.709
- DID I MENTION
ADULTS ONLY?

15:30.709 --> 15:33.667
- UM, WELL...
- ARE YOU A FIREMAN?

15:33.667 --> 15:34.834
- I SURE AM.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.000
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOT A SECRET.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.166
COME HERE.

15:38.166 --> 15:41.375
IT'S OKAY.
I'M NOT GONNA BITE.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.375
I'M ALSO AN AMATEUR MAGICIAN.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.709
POOH!

15:45.709 --> 15:46.917
- WHOA.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

15:46.917 --> 15:48.875
- COOL.
- WOW.

15:48.875 --> 15:51.041
- PRETTY GOOD.

15:51.041 --> 15:54.375
- THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OTHER
PEOPLE WHO'VE COME TO LOOK--

15:54.375 --> 15:56.041
- MOM...

15:56.041 --> 15:59.250
HE'S FINE.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.542
- WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD JUST SHOW
YOU THE ROOM, YOU KNOW,

16:01.542 --> 16:03.333
BEFORE YOU MAKE
ANY CRAZY DECISIONS.

16:03.333 --> 16:06.208
- YEAH, UH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

16:07.583 --> 16:10.041
- GOOD GAME.

16:17.166 --> 16:19.542
- IT'S PERFECT.

16:20.875 --> 16:22.709
- YOU'D HAVE YOUR OWN BATHROOM.

16:22.709 --> 16:25.041
UH, I PUT SOME TOWELS IN IT
AND STOCKED IT WITH STUFF.

16:25.041 --> 16:26.417
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED

16:26.417 --> 16:27.750
TO DO THAT
WHEN YOU HAVE A RENTER.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.542
I'VE NEVER HAD
A RENTER BEFORE, SO...

16:29.542 --> 16:31.291
- 23, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

16:31.291 --> 16:33.250
IT'S JENNY.

16:33.250 --> 16:35.792
JENNY MCCLAIN.
- JEFF SINCLAIR.

16:35.792 --> 16:38.875
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

16:53.083 --> 16:55.792
- I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.

16:55.792 --> 16:58.208
REMEMBER WHEN WE TOOK
THAT FIELD TRIP

16:58.208 --> 17:00.458
TO THE RETIREMENT HOME
AND READ TO THE OLD PEOPLE?

17:00.458 --> 17:03.041
I BET THEY'D PAY
FOR ANOTHER STORY.

17:03.041 --> 17:06.290
- WE GOT A RENTER.
WE DON'T NEED JOBS ANYMORE.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.791
- HIS LEG'S GONNA HEAL.
HE'S GONNA GO HOME.

17:08.791 --> 17:10.500
- WHY WOULD THEY PAY
FOR A STORY?

17:10.500 --> 17:12.959
I MEAN, THEY COULD JUST LISTEN
TO A CD BOOK FOR FREE.

17:12.959 --> 17:15.500
- WHEN WE WERE LITTLE,
WOULD YOU RATHER LISTEN

17:15.500 --> 17:18.125
TO A CD STORY
OR HAVE MOM READ YOU ONE?

17:18.125 --> 17:22.125
- YOU MAY HAVE A POINT.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.959
- AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

17:27.959 --> 17:30.291
OKAY,
AND WHERE ARE YOU LOCATED?

17:30.291 --> 17:32.125
WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS?
I NEED YOU TO CALM DOWN.

17:32.125 --> 17:36.000
WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS?
OKAY.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.500
YES, SOMEONE WILL BE OVER
IMMEDIATELY.

17:38.500 --> 17:42.000
JUST STAY CALM.
OKAY.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.500
SO WHAT'S UP?

17:43.500 --> 17:45.417
- I FOUND A RENTER.

17:45.417 --> 17:47.375
- AND?
- IT'S COWBOY.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.500
- NO WAY.
- YES WAY.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.959
HE HAS A THIRD-FLOOR WALK-UP,
AND HE CAN'T DO THE STAIRS--

17:52.959 --> 17:54.583
DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

17:54.583 --> 17:58.083
- WE LIKE THIS DOCTOR.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.166
- WHAT SHOULD WE CALL
OURSELVES?

18:05.166 --> 18:07.667
SHH. HE'S IN THERE.

18:07.667 --> 18:10.208
COME ON, WE NEED A NAME.

18:10.208 --> 18:13.667
- I DON'T KNOW.
UH...

18:15.458 --> 18:17.041
BOOK READERS INC.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.792
- HI.
- GOOD EVENING, MA'AM.

18:32.792 --> 18:35.333
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,
BUT IS YOUR NEW TENANT IN?

18:35.333 --> 18:37.834
- UM...
- HE'S THROUGH THERE.

18:37.834 --> 18:39.625
- WE'RE JUST GONNA DROP
A FEW THINGS OFF

18:39.625 --> 18:41.166
AND GET HIM TUCKED IN.

18:41.166 --> 18:43.041
- UH, OKAY.

18:43.041 --> 18:45.375
COME ON IN.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.000
- HEY.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.750
- HI. GOOD EVENING.
- HI.

18:49.750 --> 18:53.583
- LET'S SEE
ABOUT OUR BOY, HUH?

18:53.583 --> 18:55.166
- WE'LL BE QUICK.

18:55.166 --> 18:57.041
- GREAT.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.875
ARE YOU DOING YOUR HOMEWORK?

18:58.875 --> 19:02.875
- YEAH.
- BACK TO WORK.

19:04.083 --> 19:06.375
- OH, LOOK WHO IT IS.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

19:06.375 --> 19:08.333
ARE YOU HURT?

19:08.333 --> 19:11.041
- UH, WE GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU, JEFFY JEFF.

19:13.125 --> 19:15.959
- GUYS, COME ON.

19:15.959 --> 19:18.500
COME ON, GUYS.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.625
- BE QUIET, GUYS.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.500
- COME ON, GUYS.
NO, NO, NO.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.542
COME ON.
OW.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.583
- SO...

19:28.583 --> 19:29.917
- HEY.

19:29.917 --> 19:31.709
- I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE
THE WORD "PROFESSIONAL" IN IT,

19:31.709 --> 19:34.500
LIKE "PROFESSIONAL STORYTELLERS"

19:34.500 --> 19:37.375
OR "PROFESSIONAL READERS."

19:37.375 --> 19:39.166
- WE CAN'T JUST CALL OURSELVES
PROFESSIONALS

19:39.166 --> 19:40.542
'CAUSE WE FEEL LIKE IT.

19:40.542 --> 19:42.417
- WHY NOT?

19:42.417 --> 19:43.500
- I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE

19:43.500 --> 19:45.875
THE ADDRESS
OF THE RETIREMENT HOME.

19:45.875 --> 19:47.542
IT WILL MAKE US LOOK
MORE OFFICIAL.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.667
- GUYS!

19:53.250 --> 19:56.000
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.667
- OH, COME ON.

20:01.417 --> 20:04.917
- THANK YOU, MA'AM.
HE'S A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE NOW.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.250
- GOOD EVENING.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.750
GOOD NIGHT.

20:10.750 --> 20:13.041
THANKS.

20:29.542 --> 20:30.917
- YOU GUYS DO THIS A LOT?

20:30.917 --> 20:33.709
- WHAT'S YOUR DEFINITION
OF "A LOT"?

20:39.208 --> 20:40.792
- I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

20:40.792 --> 20:43.000
YOU KNOW,
HE'S RESPONSIBLE.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.333
- OKAY.
OKAY.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.166
- WE'LL SEE YOU
A LITTLE BIT LATER.

21:09.166 --> 21:11.375
- HAVE FUN.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.375
- HEY, KIDS.

21:40.375 --> 21:42.542
GOT ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO
WITH BASEBALL?

21:42.542 --> 21:45.208
- UH, WE GOT A LOT
OF SCIENCE FICTION.

21:45.208 --> 21:48.417
- BASEBALL--
I LIKE BASEBALL.

21:48.417 --> 21:50.375
- BASEBALL...

21:50.375 --> 21:53.834
I THINK WE'VE GOT SOMETHING.

21:57.375 --> 21:59.250
NINE INNINGS TO GLORY.

21:59.250 --> 22:01.750
- ALL RIGHT.
NOW WE'RE TALKING.

22:09.834 --> 22:12.542
- ELSIE?

22:12.542 --> 22:14.875
ELSIE, HONEY...

22:14.875 --> 22:17.417
HOW DID NATALIE'S BIRTHDAY
INVITATION GET IN THE TRASH?

22:17.417 --> 22:18.792
- I DON'T KNOW.

22:18.792 --> 22:21.875
- YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW IT GOT THERE?

22:21.875 --> 22:25.291
YOU'RE NOT GOING?
- NAH, NOT THIS YEAR.

22:25.291 --> 22:28.417
- BUT SHE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND.
- I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.

22:28.417 --> 22:31.041
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
LUKE, HONEY?

22:31.041 --> 22:33.417
- WORKING
ON THE ORAL PRESENTATION THING.

22:33.417 --> 22:34.959
- DID YOU PICK
A FAMOUS PERSON?

22:34.959 --> 22:36.792
- YEAH, THE PRESIDENT.

22:36.792 --> 22:38.125
- SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

22:38.125 --> 22:39.583
- IT'S NOT ORIGINAL.

22:39.583 --> 22:41.792
I BET, LIKE, TEN OTHER PEOPLE
ARE GONNA PICK THE PRESIDENT.

22:41.792 --> 22:45.834
- THAT'S OKAY.
- HE'S RIGHT. IT'S NOT ORIGINAL.

22:45.834 --> 22:47.959
- IT'S DUE ON THURSDAY.

22:47.959 --> 22:50.959
- SORRY.

22:50.959 --> 22:54.792
- I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING BETTER.

22:54.792 --> 22:56.417
SEE, RIGHT HERE...

22:56.417 --> 22:59.458
"ORIGINALITY COUNTS."

22:59.458 --> 23:02.834
OKAY, UM...

23:04.250 --> 23:06.583
WHAT ABOUT MOTHER TERESA?

23:06.583 --> 23:07.959
- KING ARTHUR?

23:07.959 --> 23:11.333
- SHAKESPEARE?
both: BORING.

23:11.333 --> 23:13.333
- ARE WE DISTURBING YOU?

23:13.333 --> 23:15.750
- SORRY.
- HANG ON.

23:15.750 --> 23:17.750
YOU GOT ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS?

23:20.375 --> 23:23.834
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I DO.

23:23.834 --> 23:26.041
HARRY HOUDINI.
- HE WAS A MAGICIAN.

23:26.041 --> 23:28.333
I DON'T THINK
THAT THE SCHOOL WANTS--

23:28.333 --> 23:30.625
- HE WAS NOT JUST A MAGICIAN.

23:30.625 --> 23:33.667
HE'S THE GREATEST MAGICIAN
AND ESCAPE ARTIST OF ALL TIME.

23:33.667 --> 23:35.083
- WHAT'S AN ESCAPE ARTIST?

23:35.083 --> 23:36.792
- IT'S A MAGICIAN
WHOSE SPECIALTY

23:36.792 --> 23:38.166
IS THE IMPOSSIBLE ESCAPE.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.041
THEY CALLED HOUDINI

23:40.041 --> 23:41.834
THE MAN WHO NO JAIL
COULD HOLD.

23:41.834 --> 23:43.667
HE COULD DO IT ALL.

23:43.667 --> 23:47.000
HE COULD ESCAPE FROM JAILS,
TRUNKS LOCKED IN THE OCEAN,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
STRAITJACKETS--
YOU NAME IT.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
HIS MOST FAMOUS ESCAPE

23:51.000 --> 23:52.917
WAS CALLED
THE CHINESE WATER TORTURE.

23:52.917 --> 23:55.750
THEY LOCKED HIM UPSIDE-DOWN
IN A GLASS TANK

23:55.750 --> 23:59.250
THAT WAS FULL OF WATER
WITH HIS LEGS WRAPPED IN CHAINS,

23:59.250 --> 24:02.375
HIS HANDS
CUFFED BEHIND HIS BACK.

24:02.375 --> 24:03.500
AND HE COULD GET OUT OF IT...

24:03.500 --> 24:04.959
IN A MINUTE.

24:04.959 --> 24:06.291
- WOW.

24:06.291 --> 24:08.041
- NOW, THAT'S ORIGINAL.

24:08.041 --> 24:10.875
I BET NO ONE ELSE
IS DOING HOUDINI.

24:10.875 --> 24:13.250
- OKAY. IF WE CAN FIND
ENOUGH INFORMATION.

24:13.250 --> 24:15.583
- I'VE GOT TWO GREAT BOOKS
ON HIM.

24:15.583 --> 24:17.041
- AWESOME.
THANKS.

24:17.041 --> 24:19.458
- YOU KNOW WHAT THE GREAT PART
ABOUT DOING HOUDINI IS?

24:19.458 --> 24:21.542
YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUST TALK
ABOUT HIM.

24:21.542 --> 24:24.542
YOU CAN SHOW THEM.

24:28.542 --> 24:31.875
COOL.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.375
- WELL,
THEY'RE NOT GONNA LET HIM

24:33.375 --> 24:35.125
BRING YOU TO SCHOOL
TO SHOW THEM MAGIC TRICKS.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.875
- OF COURSE NOT.

24:36.875 --> 24:39.875
I'M NOT GONNA SHOW 'EM
ANYTHING.

24:39.875 --> 24:41.417
LUKE IS.

24:46.333 --> 24:50.083
- AND THEN IN FRONT
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

24:50.083 --> 24:53.750
WHO CAME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
TO SEE HIM,

24:53.750 --> 24:56.750
HOUDINI WOULD SAY
THESE WORDS,

24:56.750 --> 25:00.583
"ONE, TWO, THREE.
I'M FREE."

25:32.959 --> 25:33.959
- NURSE?

25:33.959 --> 25:37.000
- I'M ELSIE...

25:37.000 --> 25:38.291
FROM BOOK READERS INC.

25:38.291 --> 25:41.458
YOUR FRIEND IN ROOM 30
SAID YOU WANTED A STORY?

25:41.458 --> 25:45.250
- OH, YES.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

25:52.834 --> 25:54.625
I-I CAN'T SEE, SWEETHEART,

25:54.625 --> 25:56.208
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO COME AND GET IT.

26:02.208 --> 26:05.166
MAKE YOURSELF
COMFORTABLE, ELSIE.

26:05.166 --> 26:06.542
I LOVE STORIES.

26:06.542 --> 26:08.375
BUT I CAN'T READ THEM MYSELF,

26:08.375 --> 26:12.834
SO I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU CAME.

26:12.834 --> 26:15.417
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

26:19.333 --> 26:22.041
- I'LL READ YOU THE NAME
OF THE BOOKS I HAVE WITH ME.

26:22.041 --> 26:23.834
- DO YOU HAVE
A FAVORITE, DEAR?

26:23.834 --> 26:25.834
- UH, YES.

26:25.834 --> 26:28.500
- OH, WELL,
THAT WILL BE FINE, THEN.

26:39.917 --> 26:41.667
"THERE ARE TWO KIDS--

26:41.667 --> 26:44.875
"A GOOD GIRL AND HER FUNNY
BUT SOMETIMES ANNOYING BROTHER.

26:44.875 --> 26:47.542
"AND THEY LIVED ALONE
WITH THEIR MOM.

26:47.542 --> 26:49.542
"IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY,

26:49.542 --> 26:51.041
"BUT IT HAD BEEN

26:51.041 --> 26:53.250
FOR AS LONG AS THAT LITTLE GIRL
COULD REMEMBER."

26:55.375 --> 26:57.375
- THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.
YOU TAKE CARE NOW.

26:59.875 --> 27:02.500
HI, MRS. BURNS.

27:02.500 --> 27:05.875
WHICH IS IT, ACADEMIC
OR DISCIPLINARY THIS TIME?

27:07.959 --> 27:10.208
YOU'RE KIDDING.

27:12.375 --> 27:13.709
- HEY, YOU TWO MONKEYS.

27:13.709 --> 27:15.333
GET IN HERE!

27:15.333 --> 27:17.834
I NEED AN AFTER-ACTION REPORT.

27:17.834 --> 27:20.333
HOW WAS THE PRESENTATION?

27:20.333 --> 27:21.583
- LUKE WAS AWESOME.

27:21.583 --> 27:24.750
- GOT A STANDING OVATION.

27:24.750 --> 27:26.250
- IS ALL THAT HOMEWORK?

27:31.583 --> 27:33.583
- WE HAVE JOBS.

27:33.583 --> 27:35.625
- JOBS?
- YOU CAN'T TELL OUR MOM.

27:35.625 --> 27:38.959
- WHOA, WHOA,
WHAT KIND OF JOBS?

27:38.959 --> 27:40.375
- WE READ TO OLD PEOPLE.

27:40.375 --> 27:42.250
- YOU GET PAID?

27:42.250 --> 27:44.208
YOUR MOM DOESN'T KNOW?

27:44.208 --> 27:46.667
- WE'RE MAKING MONEY
'CAUSE HER HOURS GOT CUT.

27:46.667 --> 27:48.750
THAT'S WHY SHE WAS RENTING
THE ROOM.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.792
- SO, TO HELP YOUR MOM OUT,
YOU TWO GOT JOBS.

27:55.125 --> 27:56.750
- HEY, EVERYONE.
SORRY I'M LATE.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.959
- HI, MOM.

27:58.959 --> 28:02.959
- LUKE MCCLAIN,
FRONT AND CENTER.

28:02.959 --> 28:05.750
- OH, GOD.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.000
HIDE THE MONEY.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.917
I'LL COVER.

28:11.125 --> 28:14.500
- PLEASE?

28:14.500 --> 28:17.291
- OKAY, BUT YOU GOT TO PROMISE
TO TELL YOUR MOM,

28:17.291 --> 28:19.166
BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOOD
TO KEEP SECRETS FROM HER.

28:19.166 --> 28:21.959
- DEAL.

28:28.417 --> 28:30.125
- MRS. BURNS CALLED.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.500
CONGRATULATIONS.

28:43.625 --> 28:46.542
- "HE SEES NO BLACK SKY

28:46.542 --> 28:50.625
"AND RAGING SEA,
FEELS NOT THE REELING TIMBERS,

28:50.625 --> 28:53.625
"AND LITTLE HEARS HE
OR HEEDS HE

28:53.625 --> 28:57.959
"THE FAR RUSH
OF THE MIGHTY WHALE,

28:57.959 --> 28:59.667
"WHICH EVEN NOW

28:59.667 --> 29:04.709
WITH OPEN MOUTH IS CLEAVING
THE SEAS AFTER HIM."

29:04.709 --> 29:09.083
UH, I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TO GO.

29:09.083 --> 29:10.667
- OH.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.500
- WE COULD PICK UP TOMORROW
IF YOU'D LIKE.

29:12.500 --> 29:15.959
- UH, YEAH.
SOUNDS GREAT.

29:15.959 --> 29:17.500
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

29:28.125 --> 29:29.792
- YOU WERE A FIREMAN?

29:29.792 --> 29:32.542
- USED TO BE.

29:32.542 --> 29:35.208
THESE DAYS I JUST SIT
ON THE SIDELINES

29:35.208 --> 29:37.041
AND LISTEN IN
ON THE ACTION.

29:37.041 --> 29:39.041
- I LIKE FIREMEN.

29:39.041 --> 29:41.375
- OH, YEAH?
- THEY'RE THE GOOD GUYS, RIGHT?

29:41.375 --> 29:43.875
- YOUNG LADY...

29:43.875 --> 29:47.250
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE VERY BRILLIANT.

29:49.250 --> 29:52.250
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANKS.

30:03.709 --> 30:06.875
- I WAS WONDERING
WHY YOU HADN'T BEEN IN.

30:06.875 --> 30:10.041
HOW BAD IS IT?
- IT'S A DISPLACED FRACTURE.

30:10.041 --> 30:13.041
IT'S HEALING.

30:13.041 --> 30:15.625
- EGGS AND BACON, IS IT?
- YEAH.

30:23.667 --> 30:25.959
OKAY, HERE IT COMES.

30:25.959 --> 30:28.083
YEAH, YOU DID IT!

30:28.083 --> 30:30.458
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
IF ELSIE CAN RUN THE BASES.

30:30.458 --> 30:32.417
HERE YOU GO.
POP FLY.

30:32.417 --> 30:33.625
GO, ELSIE, GO!

30:33.625 --> 30:35.250
HERE SHE COMES.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.875
GOOD CATCH.
COME ON, GET IN HERE. GO!

30:36.875 --> 30:38.917
BRING IT IN.
NICE!

30:38.917 --> 30:42.250
SHE WON.
NICE JOB! GOOD RUN!

30:42.250 --> 30:44.667
SHE DID IT.

30:44.667 --> 30:45.917
NICE JOB.

30:45.917 --> 30:47.250
YOU ARE FAST.

30:47.250 --> 30:49.083
WHAT DO YOU HAVE?
GIVE IT UP TO YOUR SISTER.

30:49.083 --> 30:52.083
GOOD JOB.

30:52.083 --> 30:54.583
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
YOUR SISTER'S GOT SPEED.

30:54.583 --> 30:57.291
WHERE'S MY BALL?

30:57.291 --> 30:59.291
GOOD JOB.

31:06.959 --> 31:09.583
911.
WHAT IS YOUR EMERGENCY?

31:09.583 --> 31:12.583
- MY EMERGENCY IS THAT MY TENANT
IS--IS TEACHING MY KIDS

31:12.583 --> 31:15.000
HOW TO FIELD A BALL
AND--AND GET "A"s IN SCHOOL.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.333
- DON'T PANIC.
HE'S GOOD WITH KIDS.

31:17.333 --> 31:20.542
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
- MY POINT?

31:20.542 --> 31:24.959
MY POINT IS THAT MY KIDS
ARE CONFUSING MY RENTER WITH--

31:24.959 --> 31:26.083
WITH A REPLACEMENT.

31:26.083 --> 31:28.417
- MIGHT YOU
BE OVERDRAMATIZING THIS,

31:28.417 --> 31:29.875
I MEAN, JUST A LITTLE BIT?

31:29.875 --> 31:31.583
- I DON'T KNOW.

31:31.583 --> 31:33.542
VERY CONFUSING.

31:33.542 --> 31:36.583
- I GOT TO GO.
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

31:47.291 --> 31:50.083
- THERE'S THIS LADY
NAMED ETHEL.

31:50.083 --> 31:53.333
SO SHE CALLS 911,
LIKE, SIX, SEVEN TIMES A DAY

31:53.333 --> 31:55.500
IN A COMPLETE PANIC.

31:55.500 --> 31:58.333
I MEAN, SHE REALLY, TRULY
BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE

31:58.333 --> 32:00.792
IN OUTER SPACE
WHO ARE BOMBARDING HER BRAIN

32:00.792 --> 32:03.333
WITH MICROWAVES
AND CONTROLLING HER IDEAS.

32:03.333 --> 32:05.667
- SO HOW'D YOU HELP HER?

32:05.667 --> 32:07.041
- DID YOU SEND IN A CHOPPER?

32:07.041 --> 32:09.000
- I KEPT THINKING...

32:09.000 --> 32:12.500
"MICROWAVES."

32:12.500 --> 32:14.625
I TOLD HER
IT WAS A DIVERSION SHIELD.

32:16.458 --> 32:17.667
AND SHE SAID IT WORKED.

32:17.667 --> 32:19.542
SHE CALLED ME BACK
THE NEXT DAY TO THANK ME.

32:19.542 --> 32:21.083
- GOOD IDEA, MOM.

32:21.083 --> 32:23.542
- SURE IS.

32:26.375 --> 32:29.083
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S TIME
FOR BED, EVERYBODY.

32:29.083 --> 32:32.208
TEETH BRUSHING.
- MOM!

32:32.208 --> 32:34.875
- NOW!

32:37.000 --> 32:38.542
SAY GOOD NIGHT TO JEFF.

32:38.542 --> 32:40.166
both:
GOOD NIGHT, JEFF.

32:40.166 --> 32:43.417
- GOOD NIGHT.

32:43.417 --> 32:45.250
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE GOOD AT YOUR JOB.

32:45.250 --> 32:47.834
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE
WOULD TAKE THE TIME

32:47.834 --> 32:52.125
TO DEAL WITH THOSE ODDBALLS.

32:52.125 --> 32:55.333
- IT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.

32:55.333 --> 32:57.875
I'M GONNA PUT THE KIDS TO BED.

32:57.875 --> 32:59.750
AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO TOO, RIGHT?

32:59.750 --> 33:01.583
PHYSICAL THERAPY.

33:01.583 --> 33:04.250
SORRY.
- YES, MA'AM.

33:04.250 --> 33:08.750
- DON'T YOU FORGET IT, COWBOY.

33:08.750 --> 33:10.959
- GOOD NIGHT.

33:10.959 --> 33:14.083
- "THE TRUTH WAS THAT THEY LOVED
EACH OTHER VERY MUCH.

33:14.083 --> 33:16.709
"AND THOUGH THEY WEREN'T
THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD,

33:16.709 --> 33:20.166
THEY WERE HAPPY
FOR YEARS TO COME."

33:20.166 --> 33:22.417
- THANK YOU.
THAT WAS WONDERFUL.

33:31.875 --> 33:34.208
- HOW ARE YOU...

33:34.208 --> 33:35.625
HOW DO YOU...

33:35.625 --> 33:38.041
- HOW DO I WHAT, SWEETHEART?

33:38.041 --> 33:42.417
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHEN A PIECE IS FINISHED?

33:42.417 --> 33:44.458
- WHY, BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE IT?

33:44.458 --> 33:45.667
- YEAH.
- OH.

33:45.667 --> 33:48.792
WELL, I KNOW
WHEN IT FEELS RIGHT.

33:48.792 --> 33:51.291
- I FEEL THAT WAY
WHEN I FINISH WRITING A STORY.

33:51.291 --> 33:53.458
- OH.
DO YOU WRITE STORIES?

33:53.458 --> 33:54.750
- MM-HMM.

33:54.750 --> 33:58.000
- WELL, I'D LIKE
TO HEAR ONE SOMETIME.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.417
- UH...

33:59.417 --> 34:01.458
- WHAT'S WRONG?

34:01.458 --> 34:03.625
- WELL, THE TRUTH IS,

34:03.625 --> 34:06.625
I'VE BEEN READING YOU
THE STUFF I WROTE MYSELF.

34:06.625 --> 34:08.083
- REALLY?

34:08.083 --> 34:10.583
- YEAH.
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?

34:10.583 --> 34:11.958
- UM, EIGHT.

34:11.958 --> 34:14.166
- EIGHT?

34:14.166 --> 34:16.958
EIGHT YEARS OLD--
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

34:16.958 --> 34:21.250
- THANK YOU.

34:21.250 --> 34:22.958
- "BOTTOM OF THE NINTH.

34:22.958 --> 34:26.667
"BASES LOADED.

34:26.667 --> 34:28.833
"AND ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT

34:28.833 --> 34:33.708
WAS JUST HOW BY..."

34:33.708 --> 34:36.000
"HAPPENSDAY"?
- HAPPENSTANCE.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.166
- "HOW BY HAPPENSTANCE

34:39.166 --> 34:42.500
"I WAS LIVING
SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE

34:42.500 --> 34:45.708
VICAR..."

34:48.000 --> 34:52.208
- OH, UM...

34:52.208 --> 34:53.833
VICARIOUSLY.

34:53.833 --> 34:57.166
VICARIOUSLY.

34:57.166 --> 34:58.500
IT'S NO USE.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.333
I'LL--I'LL GIVE YOU
YOUR DOLLAR BACK.

35:00.333 --> 35:04.333
- OH, HANG ON.
DON'T GIVE UP SO EASILY.

35:04.333 --> 35:07.250
THE KEY TO READING OUT LOUD

35:07.250 --> 35:09.667
IS TO SLOW DOWN.

35:09.667 --> 35:11.709
- BUT I DON'T WANT
TO BORE PEOPLE.

35:11.709 --> 35:16.000
- SON, BORING IS THE SAME
DUMB JOKES THE DOCTOR TELLS ME

35:16.000 --> 35:17.542
DAY AFTER DAY

35:17.542 --> 35:20.375
BECAUSE HE THINKS
I DON'T REMEMBER.

35:21.917 --> 35:25.083
TRUST ME.
YOU ARE NOT BORING.

35:25.083 --> 35:29.000
YOU'RE LIKE A BREATH
OF FRESH AIR IN THIS JOINT.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.667
- UH, THANKS.

35:31.667 --> 35:33.041
- TRY IT AGAIN.

35:37.375 --> 35:39.333
- AGAIN.

35:39.333 --> 35:43.709
ONE MORE.
ANOTHER.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.208
GOOD NEWS...

35:45.208 --> 35:46.750
YOUR LUNGS SOUND GREAT.

35:46.750 --> 35:49.291
- CAN YOU PUT THAT IN "WHEN WILL
I BE BACK AT WORK" TERMS?

35:49.291 --> 35:50.667
- LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT GUYS LIKE YOU.

35:50.667 --> 35:53.417
I SAY, "LOOKING GOOD"--
YOU HEAR, "RECOVERED,"

35:53.417 --> 35:55.083
WHICH MEANS ALL SYSTEMS GO.

35:55.083 --> 35:57.291
END RESULT--SETBACK.

35:57.291 --> 35:58.750
- NAH, YOU GOT ME WRONG.

35:58.750 --> 36:02.333
- MAYBE, BUT HERE'S THE PLAN
JUST IN CASE--

36:02.333 --> 36:04.458
STILL NO STAIRS.

36:04.458 --> 36:06.834
IN FACT,
LET ME BE MORE SPECIFIC--

36:06.834 --> 36:09.125
LEVEL SURFACES ONLY.

36:09.125 --> 36:12.583
COME BACK IN TWO WEEKS.

36:12.583 --> 36:14.917
- WILL I GET
MY "RETURN TO DUTY" SLIP?

36:14.917 --> 36:18.750
- LEVEL SURFACES ONLY.

36:18.750 --> 36:22.750
- THANKS, DOC.
- YOU BET.

36:22.750 --> 36:25.750
- IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

36:27.250 --> 36:28.750
- COME IN.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.792
- HEY, CHIEF.
- HEY.

36:32.792 --> 36:34.250
- I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO SOMEONE.

36:34.250 --> 36:37.166
CHIEF, THIS IS MY, UH...

36:38.458 --> 36:40.500
LANDLADY.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.500
- LANDLADY?

36:42.500 --> 36:44.333
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU CAN COME UP WITH?

36:44.333 --> 36:47.083
MISS, PLEASE FORGIVE
MY YOUNG FRIEND HERE.

36:47.083 --> 36:48.959
HE'S A LITTLE SHORT
ON VOCABULARY,

36:48.959 --> 36:50.583
BUT ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HIM,
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

36:50.583 --> 36:53.166
- I SURE HOPE SO.

36:53.166 --> 36:54.792
I'M JENNY.

36:54.792 --> 36:55.834
- I'M THE CHIEF.

36:55.834 --> 36:58.291
OH, BUT PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

37:06.458 --> 37:09.792
PLEASE FORGIVE ME
FOR BEING SO RUDE.

37:09.792 --> 37:12.250
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DRINK?
- NOTHING. I'M FINE.

37:12.250 --> 37:13.542
- DON'T BE SILLY.

37:13.542 --> 37:16.625
THEY'RE MAKING ICED MOCHAS
IN THE CAFETERIA.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.500
AND I KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT WOMEN GO CRAZY

37:19.500 --> 37:21.667
FOR CHOCOLATE.

37:21.667 --> 37:23.709
- YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.709
- UH...

37:25.709 --> 37:27.542
- OKAY, I'LL GET IT.
YEAH.

37:27.542 --> 37:29.875
I GOT IT.
- OH, THAT'S BIG OF YOU.

37:29.875 --> 37:33.333
- ICED MOCHAS.
- YEAH.

37:33.333 --> 37:36.834
- THIS IS A NICE WAY OF TALKING
ABOUT ME BEHIND MY BACK.

37:40.667 --> 37:42.166
- OH, WE BROUGHT BOOKS.

37:42.166 --> 37:43.750
YOU LIKE TO READ?

37:43.750 --> 37:45.667
- AS WELL AS I CAN.

37:45.667 --> 37:47.625
THE CATARACTS
ARE GETTING WORSE.

37:47.625 --> 37:50.333
BUT THEY STARTED
A NEW THING HERE

37:50.333 --> 37:53.542
WITH, UH,
KIDS READING TO YOU.

37:53.542 --> 37:56.542
A BUCK'LL GET YOU
A READER.

37:56.542 --> 37:57.875
- IS THAT YOU?

37:57.875 --> 38:00.542
- WHO?

38:00.542 --> 38:02.000
- WOW.
YOU WERE HANDSOME.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.458
- HUH?
- I MEAN, YOU STILL ARE...

38:04.458 --> 38:07.083
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE UNIFORM.

38:07.083 --> 38:08.834
- OH, YEAH.
- WOW.

38:08.834 --> 38:12.166
- WELL, FLATTERY GETS YOU
EVERYWHERE.

38:12.166 --> 38:16.375
DOES THE GUY NEXT TO ME
LOOK LIKE JEFF?

38:18.291 --> 38:20.417
- HE DOES.
- MM. IT'S HIS OLD MAN.

38:20.417 --> 38:23.834
- WHERE IS HE?
- OH, FIRE GOT HIM.

38:25.375 --> 38:27.166
HE WENT IN,
AND THE ROOF COLLAPSED.

38:27.166 --> 38:28.709
HE DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT.

38:28.709 --> 38:30.917
- HOW OLD WAS JEFF?
- TEN YEARS OLD.

38:33.375 --> 38:35.917
NOW, I-I'VE BEEN HERE
SEVEN YEARS.

38:35.917 --> 38:38.875
HOW MANY GUYS DO YOU KNOW
WOULD KEEP COMING BACK TO VISIT

38:38.875 --> 38:40.250
AN OLD SMOKE EATER LIKE ME?

38:40.250 --> 38:42.041
HOW MANY?

38:42.041 --> 38:44.250
- NOT MANY.

38:44.250 --> 38:46.959
- ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO,
WE'RE BACK.

38:46.959 --> 38:49.917
- OH, WE WERE JUST GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

38:51.750 --> 38:55.417
THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME, CHIEF.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.834
- HIS TIME'S ALMOST UP.

38:57.834 --> 39:01.583
- HE WON'T LEAVE.
AND MOM DOESN'T WANT HIM TO.

39:01.583 --> 39:02.917
THEY LIKE EACH OTHER.

39:02.917 --> 39:04.375
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

39:04.375 --> 39:05.750
- DO TOO.

39:05.750 --> 39:07.709
THEY WHISPER.

39:07.709 --> 39:09.959
YOU DON'T WHISPER
TO SOMEONE YOU DON'T LIKE.

39:09.959 --> 39:12.125
- IF THEY REALLY LIKED
EACH OTHER,

39:12.125 --> 39:13.709
THEY'D GO ON A DATE.

39:13.709 --> 39:15.458
- MAYBE THEY WILL.

39:15.458 --> 39:17.792
- YOU CAN'T DATE A RENTER.

39:17.792 --> 39:19.125
- THERE'S NO RULE ON THAT.

39:19.125 --> 39:21.625
- WELL, THERE'S A RULE
ON BROKEN BONES.

39:21.625 --> 39:25.625
YOU CAN'T TAKE SOMEONE OUT
TO DINNER IF YOU CAN'T DRIVE.

39:27.250 --> 39:29.917
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.834
- HEY, GUYS.
HOW WAS SCHOOL?

39:39.834 --> 39:41.291
- YOU GOT TO STAY IN HERE.

39:41.291 --> 39:42.792
- MOM'S HAVING A MEETING
TONIGHT.

39:42.792 --> 39:46.667
- IT'S SERIOUS.
- YOU GOT TO STAY RIGHT HERE.

39:49.291 --> 39:51.458
- WITH THE DOOR CLOSED.

40:00.166 --> 40:02.375
WHAT DID YOU BREAK?

40:02.375 --> 40:04.834
both:
NOTHING.

40:04.834 --> 40:06.667
- SOMEONE'S COMING OVER.

40:06.667 --> 40:09.542
- CAN YOU PUT ON
SOMETHING NICER?

40:09.542 --> 40:12.000
- WHO'S COMING OVER?

40:12.000 --> 40:14.792
- SCHOOL COUNSELOR.
MRS. BURNS WANTS TO SEE YOU.

40:14.792 --> 40:17.625
- LUKE, WHAT DID YOU DO?
- YOU'RE IN YOUR 911 CLOTHES.

40:17.625 --> 40:20.500
CAN YOU CHANGE
INTO SOMETHING UN-WEIRD?

40:20.500 --> 40:22.834
- I HAVE TO BE UN-WEIRD
FOR MRS. BURNS?

40:22.834 --> 40:24.917
- HEY, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
IT HAS TO DO WITH ME

40:24.917 --> 40:27.125
AND NOT ELSIE?
- WELL, THAT'S FAIR.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.000
DOES IT?

40:39.333 --> 40:41.208
- DINNER'S READY.

40:41.208 --> 40:43.375
- THE MEETING'S OVER ALREADY?

40:43.375 --> 40:48.041
- MOM, SHE'S HERE!
I STUCK HER IN THE KITCHEN.

40:58.083 --> 41:00.709
- UH...

41:02.959 --> 41:05.875
- MOM, WE'LL BE DOING HOMEWORK
UPSTAIRS.

41:05.875 --> 41:07.333
- I'M SO SORRY.

41:07.333 --> 41:09.709
- DON'T--DON'T BE.

41:34.417 --> 41:38.041
OH.

41:39.834 --> 41:41.125
- SO FAR SO GOOD.

41:43.959 --> 41:45.667
SO WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY?

41:45.667 --> 41:47.542
- I GOT
THE "TOO SOON TO KNOW" SPIEL.

41:47.542 --> 41:51.750
- THEN IF YOU'RE LIKE ME,
YOU'RE ON THE WHAT-IF BUS.

41:51.750 --> 41:55.000
- YEAH, LIKE,
WHAT IF I RENT MY ROOM

41:55.000 --> 41:59.250
TO MY TENANT,
WHO'S CHARMING,

41:59.250 --> 42:01.333
EVEN DEBONAIR,

42:01.333 --> 42:03.417
AND THEN YOUR KIDS,
THEY FIX YOU UP,

42:03.417 --> 42:05.166
AND INSTEAD OF DANCING
UNDERNEATH THE STARS,

42:05.166 --> 42:07.375
YOU'RE EATING BREAKFAST
FOR DINNER IN YOUR OWN KITCHEN.

42:07.375 --> 42:10.125
- LIKE THAT...

42:10.125 --> 42:11.625
EXCEPT FOR THE DEBONAIR PART.

42:11.625 --> 42:13.458
- WELL, NOBODY'S PERFECT...

42:13.458 --> 42:16.458
- NOT EVEN FIREMEN.

42:35.542 --> 42:37.125
- HOW DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE DOING?

42:37.125 --> 42:38.375
- LEAVE 'EM ALONE.

42:38.375 --> 42:40.625
THEY NEED MORE TIME
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

42:45.458 --> 42:47.166
- OKAY, OKAY.
I WILL START.

42:47.166 --> 42:50.250
WORST DATE EVER.

42:52.917 --> 42:56.166
UH, OKAY,
THERE WAS THIS GIRL.

42:56.166 --> 42:57.542
IT'S OUR FIRST DATE.

42:57.542 --> 42:59.917
SHE ASKED ME TO GO
ON A SUNDAY DRIVE TO CARMEL

42:59.917 --> 43:01.667
AFTER SHE BOUGHT
A BRAND-NEW CAR.

43:01.667 --> 43:03.083
- THAT SOUNDS NICE.

43:03.083 --> 43:05.458
- TILL SHE PICKED ME UP.

43:05.458 --> 43:07.417
I JUMPED
INTO THE DRIVER'S SEAT.

43:07.417 --> 43:11.667
AS WE'RE PULLING AWAY
FROM THE CURB, I TURN AROUND.

43:11.667 --> 43:13.667
HER PARENTS
ARE IN THE BACKSEAT.

43:13.667 --> 43:15.417
- WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

43:15.417 --> 43:18.166
- OH, I TOLD A LOT
OF BURNING-BUILDING STORIES,

43:18.166 --> 43:23.333
AND I WATCHED THAT ODOMETER
COUNT ALL 300 MILES.

43:25.500 --> 43:27.709
ALL RIGHT.

43:27.709 --> 43:30.417
YOUR TURN.

43:30.417 --> 43:34.208
- SAME--
IT WAS THE FIRST DATE.

43:34.208 --> 43:36.875
HE TOOK ME TO THE MOVIES.

43:36.875 --> 43:39.333
AND RIGHT OFF THE BAT,
HE STARTS LAUGHING,

43:39.333 --> 43:42.125
I MEAN, AT FULL VOLUME,

43:42.125 --> 43:44.041
SEAT-SHAKING BELLY LAUGH.

43:44.041 --> 43:45.709
- WHAT WAS THE MATTER?

43:45.709 --> 43:48.041
- THE MOVIE
HADN'T EVEN STARTED YET.

43:48.041 --> 43:50.375
- WHAT'D YOU DO?

43:50.375 --> 43:52.417
- I MARRIED HIM.

43:52.417 --> 43:56.208
- HOW'D THAT WORK OUT?
- OBVIOUSLY, NOT GREAT.

43:56.208 --> 43:59.000
HE LEFT.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.375
AND I DON'T MEAN,
LIKE, LEFT,

44:02.375 --> 44:03.917
LIKE MOVED DOWN THE STREET.

44:03.917 --> 44:07.208
HE, UM...
HE DISAPPEARED.

44:10.083 --> 44:13.041
WE NEVER HEARD
FROM HIM AGAIN.

44:13.041 --> 44:14.417
- HOW OLD WERE THE KIDS?

44:14.417 --> 44:17.625
- THREE AND FIVE.

44:21.834 --> 44:24.750
BUDDY TOLD ME THAT YOU LOST
YOUR DAD WHEN YOU WERE A KID.

44:24.750 --> 44:26.875
- YEAH.

44:28.834 --> 44:31.333
HE DIED IN A FIRE...

44:31.333 --> 44:32.792
ALONE.

44:36.500 --> 44:38.750
HIS TWO-IN WAS ON THE PORCH.

44:38.750 --> 44:40.417
- TWO-IN?

44:40.417 --> 44:43.333
- FIREFIGHTERS--

44:43.333 --> 44:44.750
IT'S WHAT WE DO.

44:44.750 --> 44:46.625
TWO IN, TWO OUT.

44:46.625 --> 44:48.875
TWO GO IN,
TWO COME OUT...

44:48.875 --> 44:50.417
OR DON'T COME OUT AT ALL.

44:50.417 --> 44:53.750
- WHY WAS THE TWO-IN OUTSIDE?

44:53.750 --> 44:56.417
- HE WAS A BOOT--
A ROOKIE.

44:58.834 --> 45:01.000
HE SAID HE SAW SIGNS
OF A FLASHOVER--

45:01.000 --> 45:03.917
DARK SMOKE,

45:03.917 --> 45:08.125
I.E., FIRE ON THE CEILING
THAT COULDN'T BE VENTED.

45:08.125 --> 45:09.500
YOU KNOW WHAT?

45:09.500 --> 45:12.709
THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE GONE IN,
BUT MY DAD HEARD KIDS

45:12.709 --> 45:14.917
AND WENT ANYWAY.

45:22.625 --> 45:24.625
- I'M SORRY.

45:31.166 --> 45:34.542
UM, WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO DO ME A FAVOR?

45:34.542 --> 45:37.041
- OF COURSE.

45:37.041 --> 45:39.208
- WOULD YOU TALK TO LUKE
ABOUT YOUR DAD?

45:39.208 --> 45:41.709
- YEAH.

45:41.709 --> 45:44.041
SURE.

45:44.041 --> 45:45.333
W-WHY?

45:45.333 --> 45:47.166
- I JUST THINK IT'D BE NICE

45:47.166 --> 45:48.875
FOR HIM TO KNOW
HE'S NOT THE ONLY BOY

45:48.875 --> 45:50.500
GROWING UP
WITHOUT A FATHER.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.500
HEY.
- HEY.

46:02.667 --> 46:06.250
- THIS RENTER THING
HAS ITS UPSIDES.

46:06.250 --> 46:08.375
I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD
FOR THE KIDS.

46:08.375 --> 46:11.041
- JUST FOR THE KIDS?

46:13.333 --> 46:15.333
- OKAY, SO HE SAID
I NEED A BREAK,

46:15.333 --> 46:17.000
AND HE'S TAKING ME OUT TONIGHT.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.834
911.
WHAT'S YOUR EMERGENCY?

46:19.834 --> 46:22.083
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

46:22.083 --> 46:23.542
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO WEAR.

46:23.542 --> 46:24.875
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

46:24.875 --> 46:26.750
- THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF ALL OF THIS--

46:26.750 --> 46:28.375
THE JITTERS,
THE BUTTERFLIES.

46:28.375 --> 46:30.750
IF YOU DIDN'T FEEL THAT WAY,

46:30.750 --> 46:32.875
IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE WORTH
GOING ON THE DATE.

46:32.875 --> 46:35.375
- IT'S NOT A DATE.
- YEAH, IT IS.

46:35.375 --> 46:38.542
- NO, IT'S NOT.
- YES, IT IS.

46:38.542 --> 46:42.166
LOOK, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO ASKS WHO OR WHERE YOU GO.

46:42.166 --> 46:44.375
IF TWO SINGLE PEOPLE
SET A TIME

46:44.375 --> 46:46.375
AND THEY ANXIOUSLY LOOK
FORWARD TO IT

46:46.375 --> 46:48.208
AND THAT TIME HAPPENS
TO BE AFTER DARK,

46:48.208 --> 46:51.208
TRUST ME, IT'S A DATE.

46:51.208 --> 46:53.709
DO SOMETHING
WITH YOUR HAIR.

46:55.750 --> 46:59.750
- "I CARED NOT TO DRIVE A NAIL
OR CHOP A STICK OF WOOD NOW

46:59.750 --> 47:02.834
"FOR FEAR THE NOISE
I SHOULD MAKE SHOULD BE HEARD.

47:02.834 --> 47:06.041
"MUCH LESS WOULD I FIRE A GUN
FOR THE SAME REASON.

47:06.041 --> 47:10.083
"AND ABOVE ALL,
I WAS INTOLERABLY UNEASY

47:10.083 --> 47:11.917
"AT MAKING ANY FIRE,

47:11.917 --> 47:14.250
"LEST THE SMOKE,
WHICH IS VISIBLE

47:14.250 --> 47:16.709
"AT A GREAT DISTANCE
IN THE DAY,

47:16.709 --> 47:18.125
"SHOULD BETRAY ME.

47:18.125 --> 47:20.083
"AND FOR THIS REASON,
I HAVE REMOVED

47:20.083 --> 47:23.250
"THAT PART OF MY BUSINESS
WHICH REQUIRED FIRE,

47:23.250 --> 47:25.917
"SUCH AS BURNING OF POTS
AND PIPES, ET CETERA,

47:25.917 --> 47:28.250
IN A MINUTE APARTMENT
IN THE WOODS."

47:30.750 --> 47:34.375
- ATTABOY, LUKE.
WAY TO GO.

47:34.375 --> 47:37.375
THAT WAS FANTASTIC.

47:42.417 --> 47:45.917
- YEAH, I MEAN, I KNOW
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A FIGHT.

47:45.917 --> 47:48.250
LOOK, I'M GONNA ASK HER
ONE MORE TIME,

47:48.250 --> 47:49.959
AND I WILL CALL YOU BACK, OKAY?

47:49.959 --> 47:52.959
OKAY, THANKS.

47:54.875 --> 47:56.625
ELSIE, THAT WAS NATALIE'S MOM.

47:56.625 --> 47:58.834
I KNOW
SOMETHING IS BOTHERING YOU,

47:58.834 --> 48:00.959
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS.

48:02.792 --> 48:06.125
BUT I WANT TO WARN YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

48:06.125 --> 48:09.500
NATALIE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND.

48:09.500 --> 48:12.166
AND THIS IS HER SPECIAL DAY.

48:12.166 --> 48:15.500
AND IF YOU MISS IT, I THINK IT
WOULD REALLY HURT HER FEELINGS.

48:18.375 --> 48:21.834
- IT'S BECAUSE OF HER BROTHER.

48:21.834 --> 48:23.166
HE HAS A SNAKE.

48:23.166 --> 48:26.542
EVERYONE SAYS IT'S HUGE.

48:26.542 --> 48:29.333
AND I'M AFRAID HE'S GONNA TAKE
IT OUT DURING THE PARTY.

48:29.333 --> 48:32.000
- OKAY, SWEETHEART,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.667
ALL RIGHT?

48:36.917 --> 48:39.500
- JEFF, WHAT?
- UM...

48:39.500 --> 48:40.834
- IT'S OKAY.

48:40.834 --> 48:44.500
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,
JUST SAY IT.

48:44.500 --> 48:48.041
- WHY DON'T WE TRY THIS?

48:48.041 --> 48:51.000
WHY DO YOU THINK
HER BROTHER WOULD DO THAT?

48:51.000 --> 48:53.166
- BECAUSE HE KNOWS
WE'LL SCREAM.

48:53.166 --> 48:56.834
- AND WHICH GIRLS
IS HE GONNA IGNORE?

48:56.834 --> 48:59.000
- THE ONES WHO AREN'T AFRAID.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.166
- THAT'S RIGHT.

49:00.166 --> 49:01.417
IF HE DOESN'T KNOW
YOU'RE SCARED,

49:01.417 --> 49:03.291
HE'S GONNA LEAVE YOU ALONE.

49:03.291 --> 49:05.125
THAT'S THE FIRST PART
OF OUR PLAN.

49:05.125 --> 49:09.709
- SO I JUST PRETEND
NOT TO BE SCARED?

49:09.709 --> 49:10.792
- MM-HMM.

49:10.792 --> 49:12.667
- WHAT'S THE SECOND PART?

49:12.667 --> 49:14.375
- YOU TEXT YOUR MOM
A SECRET CODE.

49:14.375 --> 49:15.875
WE'LL COME TO THE HOUSE.

49:15.875 --> 49:18.000
WE'LL HAVE AN EXCUSE
AND BRING YOU HOME,

49:18.000 --> 49:22.041
AND NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW
YOU WERE SCARED.

49:22.041 --> 49:23.625
- WHAT'S THE SECRET CODE?

49:23.625 --> 49:26.166
- HMM.

49:35.750 --> 49:39.250
2N?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

49:39.250 --> 49:41.625
- 2N.
THAT'S FIREFIGHTERS' CODE.

49:41.625 --> 49:43.250
THAT'S HOW WE WORK.

49:43.250 --> 49:47.834
SOMEONE IS ALWAYS LOOKING OUT
FOR YOU.

50:19.583 --> 50:21.125
- AM I OVERDRESSED?

50:21.125 --> 50:23.083
- PERFECT.

50:27.166 --> 50:30.417
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA GET
A BABYSITTER.

50:30.417 --> 50:32.625
- YOU BOTH GOT CELLS?

50:32.625 --> 50:35.709
- THAT DOESN'T WORK.
THEY CAN'T BE ALONE.

50:35.709 --> 50:37.959
- JEN, THEY'RE
NOT GONNA BE ALONE.

50:37.959 --> 50:39.875
JUST LET IT PLAY OUT
FOR A MINUTE.

50:39.875 --> 50:42.709
- YEAH, MOM,
JUST LET IT PLAY OUT.

50:42.709 --> 50:45.792
- HEAR THAT?
"JEN."

51:01.041 --> 51:03.000
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?

51:23.166 --> 51:24.875
WOW.

51:28.834 --> 51:30.166
OH, MY...

51:33.208 --> 51:36.500
- YOU THINK THEY'RE OKAY
IN THERE?

51:37.834 --> 51:41.000
- YES. AS LONG AS THEY STAY
OUT OF SIGHT.

51:46.375 --> 51:48.750
THE WORST OF IT WAS...

51:48.750 --> 51:52.083
WATCHING THEM WAIT AND WAIT,

51:52.083 --> 51:55.125
EVERY DAY ASKING,
"DID DADDY CALL?"

51:55.125 --> 51:58.125
- HOW LONG?

51:58.125 --> 52:01.375
- 18 MONTHS, 26 DAYS

52:01.375 --> 52:04.375
BEFORE THEY
FINALLY STOPPED ASKING.

52:04.375 --> 52:07.291
- I STILL COUNT.
- COUNT WHAT?

52:07.291 --> 52:11.417
- HOW MANY DAYS IT'S BEEN
SINCE THE FIRE...

52:11.417 --> 52:14.875
MY DAD.
- WHAT HAPPENED?

52:16.458 --> 52:19.458
- HOW MANY 911 CALLS
HAVE YOU TAKEN?

52:19.458 --> 52:23.458
- UM, I DON'T KNOW.
THOUSANDS, I GUESS.

52:23.458 --> 52:24.875
- YOU EVER HAVE A CALL

52:24.875 --> 52:27.375
WHERE ONLY ONE PERSON

52:27.375 --> 52:28.917
SAID HE HEARD CHILDREN INSIDE?

52:28.917 --> 52:31.959
NOT ANYONE ELSE--
JUST ONE--

52:31.959 --> 52:35.417
LIKE MY DAD'S FIRE?

52:35.417 --> 52:37.250
NO ONE MENTIONED
CHILDREN INSIDE,

52:37.250 --> 52:39.250
NOT ON THE RADIO,

52:39.250 --> 52:42.417
NOT BY A WITNESS OR...

52:42.417 --> 52:45.583
ANYONE REPORTING...

52:45.583 --> 52:47.500
JUST THE ROOKIE PARTNER.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.250
- YOU THINK THE ROOKIE...
- WAS COVERING A BAD DECISION.

52:53.250 --> 52:56.250
- OH, JEFF.

52:56.250 --> 53:01.458
- YOU KNOW, MY DAD,
HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO GO IN.

53:01.458 --> 53:03.917
I DON'T THINK
HE SHOULD HAVE GONE IN.

53:03.917 --> 53:06.417
I DON'T THINK
HE HEARD ANYONE.

53:10.333 --> 53:13.000
I THINK IT WAS A MISTAKE.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.667
- YOU THINK THIS ROOKIE
LIED ABOUT THE KIDS

53:17.667 --> 53:20.125
'CAUSE HE WAS COVERING
FOR YOUR DAD?

53:20.125 --> 53:21.959
- YEAH.

53:23.834 --> 53:26.875
AS OF A MINUTE AGO...

53:29.125 --> 53:32.667
I THINK YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT ME
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

53:44.750 --> 53:47.750
- TOLD YA.

54:06.667 --> 54:08.458
- ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
PAY UP.

54:08.458 --> 54:10.208
A BET IS A BET.

54:10.208 --> 54:12.125
COME ON, GIVE IT UP.

54:15.542 --> 54:17.041
THANK YOU.

54:17.041 --> 54:21.041
I REALLY THANK YOU
FOR YOUR MONEY.

54:33.709 --> 54:36.542
- YOU TWO THE BOOKWORMS?

54:36.542 --> 54:39.417
WELL, I'M THE DIRECTOR
OF THIS FACILITY,

54:39.417 --> 54:41.583
AND I NEED TO SPEAK
TO YOU BOTH

54:41.583 --> 54:45.208
IN PRIVATE.

54:53.875 --> 54:56.542
- WE'RE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE.

54:56.542 --> 54:59.375
- OUR READING JOBS ARE OVER.
- WE GOT CAUGHT.

54:59.375 --> 55:02.041
- WE DON'T HAVE THE PROPER
PAPERS, AND WE'RE DODGING TAXES,

55:02.041 --> 55:04.208
AND WE'RE SWINDLING THE
GOVERNMENT OUT OF THEIR MONEY.

55:04.208 --> 55:07.834
- WE WERE STEALING MONEY FROM
PEOPLE WHO ARE INCOMPATIBLE.

55:07.834 --> 55:09.375
- YOU MEAN INCOMPETENT?

55:09.375 --> 55:11.875
- THAT TOO.
- IS THAT MY BOOT?

55:11.875 --> 55:14.375
- IT'S OUR TIP JAR.

55:14.375 --> 55:16.208
WE BORROWED IT.
- WE NEED YOU TO CALL

55:16.208 --> 55:17.750
THAT ADMINISTRATOR LADY.

55:17.750 --> 55:19.959
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HOLD ON. TIME-OUT.

55:19.959 --> 55:21.250
- SHE SAID OUR PARENTS
HAVE TO CALL.

55:21.250 --> 55:23.250
- BUT SHE DIDN'T KNOW
WE ONLY HAVE ONE.

55:23.250 --> 55:26.041
- AND SHE'S THE ONE
WHO HAS TO MAKE THAT CALL.

55:26.041 --> 55:28.458
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL
YOUR MOM ABOUT YOUR JOBS?

55:28.458 --> 55:30.542
- SHE'D MAKE US
RETURN THE MONEY.

55:30.542 --> 55:31.959
- AND WOULDN'T LET US GO BACK.

55:31.959 --> 55:33.583
- WELL, THAT'S HER DECISION
TO MAKE.

55:33.583 --> 55:35.959
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT THE ONE WHO'S
READING TO AN OLD BLIND LADY

55:35.959 --> 55:38.125
WHO'S WAITING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

55:38.125 --> 55:41.291
- AND BUDDY REALLY WANTS TO HEAR
THE END OF MOBY DICK.

55:41.291 --> 55:43.959
HE'S NEVER READ IT.
- BUDDY?

55:43.959 --> 55:46.375
YOU READ TO A MAN
NAMED BUDDY?

55:46.375 --> 55:49.417
IS THAT
THE SUNBRIAR RETIREMENT HOME?

55:53.291 --> 55:56.500
SHH.

55:56.500 --> 55:58.125
YES.

55:58.125 --> 56:00.166
YES, IS SHE THE ONE
IN CHARGE?

56:03.250 --> 56:05.083
THEN YOU CAN PUT ME ON HOLD.
THANK YOU.

56:05.083 --> 56:06.625
THEY'RE GONNA GO GET HER
RIGHT NOW.

56:06.625 --> 56:09.917
WOULD YOU PUT THAT
IN MY ROOM, PLEASE?

56:09.917 --> 56:11.625
YES, MA'AM.

56:11.625 --> 56:14.333
YEAH, I'M CALLING IN REGARDS
TO LUKE AND ELSIE.

56:38.458 --> 56:40.709
I KNOW.

56:40.709 --> 56:42.542
BUT SHOULDN'T THEY
AT LEAST GET TO FINISH

56:42.542 --> 56:46.250
THE STORIES
THAT THEY STARTED?

56:46.250 --> 56:49.667
THEY'VE MADE COMMITMENTS.

56:49.667 --> 56:52.000
WELL, THEY'VE BEEN TAUGHT

56:52.000 --> 56:56.166
THAT THEY SHOULDN'T MAKE
COMMITMENTS THAT CAN'T BE KEPT.

56:56.166 --> 56:58.709
LOOK, WHY DON'T
I JUST COME DOWN IN PERSON

56:58.709 --> 57:01.083
AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS?

57:01.083 --> 57:03.208
PERFECT.

57:03.208 --> 57:05.125
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

57:05.125 --> 57:06.959
OKAY.
BYE-BYE.

57:06.959 --> 57:08.458
- THANKS, JEFF.

57:08.458 --> 57:09.792
- DON'T THANK ME YET.

57:09.792 --> 57:11.792
- WELL, AT LEAST
THANKS FOR TRYING.

57:11.792 --> 57:15.875
- WELL, IT'S
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

57:18.875 --> 57:21.417
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
HE FIGURED OUT THE SNAKE THING.

57:21.417 --> 57:23.375
IT'S NOT WHAT
I WOULD HAVE TOLD HER TO DO.

57:23.375 --> 57:26.375
I GUESS IT'S JUST SOMETHING
A GUY WOULD THINK OF.

57:26.375 --> 57:28.875
- NO, HONEY, NOT ALL GUYS--

57:28.875 --> 57:30.500
JUST KEEPERS.

57:30.500 --> 57:32.375
AND I KNOW A LOT
ABOUT BOYS AND REPTILES.

57:32.375 --> 57:33.875
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T CALL ME.

57:33.875 --> 57:35.417
- WELL, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

57:41.417 --> 57:43.041
YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS.

57:43.041 --> 57:47.583
- OH, MY GOSH,
THAT IS SO CUTE.

57:47.583 --> 57:49.041
WHERE ARE THEY?

57:49.041 --> 57:51.709

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.417
IN A FIRE
WHEN I WAS TEN.

01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:20.250
- I ALWAYS WONDERED

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:23.417
WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE
TO HAVE A DAD...

01:01:23.417 --> 01:01:26.208
YOU KNOW, TO STRIKE OUT
IN A BALL GAME

01:01:26.208 --> 01:01:28.917
AND HAVE A DAD THERE.

01:01:28.917 --> 01:01:32.125
BUT THEN ON THE WAY HOME,

01:01:32.125 --> 01:01:34.709
HE'D POINT OUT
SOMETHING I DID GOOD...

01:01:34.709 --> 01:01:36.792
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

01:01:38.125 --> 01:01:42.750
THAT'S WHAT
OTHER KIDS' DADS DO.

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:45.458
- YEAH.

01:01:45.458 --> 01:01:49.000
I ALWAYS IMAGINED IT
LIKE THIS.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.792
WE BOTH KNOW
YOU DIDN'T PLAY WELL,

01:01:51.792 --> 01:01:54.959
BUT WHEN YOU AND YOUR DAD
DRIVE HOME,

01:01:54.959 --> 01:01:57.959
HE'D TELL YOU IT WAS A BAD CALL
BY THE UMP,

01:01:57.959 --> 01:02:02.083
THEN DO SOMETHING NICE...

01:02:02.083 --> 01:02:04.041
STOP FOR A MILKSHAKE.

01:02:04.041 --> 01:02:07.041
YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND OUT?

01:02:08.542 --> 01:02:10.375
THAT THERE WERE OTHER GUYS
WHO WOULD TAKE ME

01:02:10.375 --> 01:02:13.542
FOR THAT MILKSHAKE.

01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:55.917
- HEY.

01:03:59.542 --> 01:04:01.375
BAD CALL AT WORK?

01:04:03.583 --> 01:04:05.458
I'M SORRY.

01:04:05.458 --> 01:04:08.875
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED YOU
TO TALK TO LUKE ABOUT YOUR DAD.

01:04:08.875 --> 01:04:12.041
HE'S NEVER REALLY HAD
SOMEONE LIKE YOU

01:04:12.041 --> 01:04:13.750
TO LOOK UP TO...

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:15.208
EVER.

01:04:15.208 --> 01:04:18.000
AND--AND ELSIE...

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.125
SHE WORSHIPS YOU,
AND I--

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:25.375
AND HERE'S THE DEAL, OKAY?

01:04:25.375 --> 01:04:28.458
THIS ISN'T
THE WHAT-IF BUS ANYMORE.

01:04:28.458 --> 01:04:29.917
THIS IS WHAT IS.

01:04:29.917 --> 01:04:32.000
- OKAY.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.375
- THE BAD CALL I HAD AT WORK

01:04:36.375 --> 01:04:39.792
WAS AN OFFICER...

01:04:39.792 --> 01:04:42.083
IN A FELONY HIGH-SPEED PURSUIT.

01:04:42.083 --> 01:04:44.792
AND NOW SOMEONE IS KNOCKING
ON HIS DOOR

01:04:44.792 --> 01:04:48.792
TO LET HIS WIFE AND KIDS KNOW
THAT HE IS NEVER COMING BACK.

01:04:58.625 --> 01:05:01.000
- I WAS THAT KID ONCE.

01:05:03.417 --> 01:05:05.166
- SO YOU UNDERSTAND.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:13.500
YOU UNDERSTAND THE DANGER
OF A KID HAVING A FATHER

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.166
OR A FATHER FIGURE WHOSE LIFE
IS ALWAYS ON THE LINE.

01:05:16.166 --> 01:05:20.875
- I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR KIDS

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:24.709
OR YOURSELF THROUGH THAT.

01:05:24.709 --> 01:05:27.041
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS...

01:05:27.041 --> 01:05:30.125
WHY YOU'RE LETTING THE WHAT-IF
GET IN THE WAY OF THE WHAT-IS.

01:05:30.125 --> 01:05:33.500
- JEFF, COME ON.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.834
THEY ALREADY LOST
A FATHER ONCE.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:44.166
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW THEY--

01:05:44.166 --> 01:05:47.417
HOW WE COULD GO
THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

01:05:49.583 --> 01:05:53.083
- I LOVE YOU.

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:56.542
I LOVE YOUR KIDS.

01:06:07.041 --> 01:06:08.625
- I'M SORRY.

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:16.208
I'M SO SORRY.

01:06:35.417 --> 01:06:38.417
- COME ON,
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:45.166
MOM...

01:06:45.166 --> 01:06:46.375
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:06:46.375 --> 01:06:48.083
- WHY WOULD YOU THINK
SOMETHING'S WRONG?

01:06:48.083 --> 01:06:50.542
- YOU'RE JUST STANDING THERE
ALL STILL.

01:06:50.542 --> 01:06:52.333
- I THINK WE SHOULD TALK.

01:06:58.583 --> 01:06:59.792
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

01:06:59.792 --> 01:07:01.000
- TO THE DOCTOR.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.291
KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED.

01:07:02.291 --> 01:07:04.417
HE MAY RELEASE ME
TO GO BACK TO WORK.

01:07:04.417 --> 01:07:08.125
- BUT THAT MEANS
YOU COULD GO HOME.

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:09.792
- WELL, YEAH.
THAT'S WHERE HE LIVES--

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:12.458
AT HIS HOME.
- WOULD YOU STILL COME EAT HERE?

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:17.959
- IF HE CAN GO TO WORK,
HE'LL EAT AT THE STATION.

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.458
- ARE YOU GUYS
GONNA STAY FRIENDS?

01:07:24.625 --> 01:07:26.333
BUT YOU GUYS WHISPERED.

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:27.667
- WHISPERED?

01:07:27.667 --> 01:07:30.542
- YOU DON'T WHISPER TO SOMEONE
YOU DON'T LIKE.

01:07:30.542 --> 01:07:32.542
- IT MEANS NOTHING.

01:07:32.542 --> 01:07:35.000
IT DOESN'T WORK
THAT WAY!

01:07:39.458 --> 01:07:40.875
- LUKE, COME ON--

01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:49.834
- CAN I STILL USE
OUR SECRET CODE--

01:07:49.834 --> 01:07:51.417
2N?

01:07:54.917 --> 01:07:57.542
- THIS IS
WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

01:08:58.375 --> 01:09:01.375
- 911 EMERGENCY.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.625
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:33.792
DO YOU GUYS WANT
TO GO TO THE MOVIES

01:09:33.792 --> 01:09:35.959
TONIGHT INSTEAD OF THURSDAY?

01:09:35.959 --> 01:09:39.582
NOT REALLY.

01:09:39.582 --> 01:09:42.250
- YEAH.
NOT REALLY.

01:09:48.082 --> 01:09:49.750
- I MISS HIM TOO.

01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:57.458
- HOW MUCH PAIN MEDICINE?

01:09:57.458 --> 01:10:00.041
- NONE.

01:10:00.041 --> 01:10:01.875
- OKAY,
LET'S DO A FINAL CHECK,

01:10:01.875 --> 01:10:03.458
SEE IF YOU'RE GETTING
YOUR HEARING BACK.

01:10:03.458 --> 01:10:04.959
- MY HEARING?

01:10:04.959 --> 01:10:06.667
- I FIND MOST FIREMEN
WHO WERE INJURED

01:10:06.667 --> 01:10:07.667
END UP WITH HEARING LOSS.

01:10:07.667 --> 01:10:09.333
- REALLY?

01:10:09.333 --> 01:10:11.625
- LET'S CHECK THOSE EARS.

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:14.458
WHEN I SAY "LIGHT DUTY,"

01:10:14.458 --> 01:10:15.750
WHAT DO YOU HEAR?

01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:17.500
- LIGHT DUTY.

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.125
- OH. GOOD.

01:10:19.125 --> 01:10:20.542
SO YOU DON'T HEAR ANYTHING

01:10:20.542 --> 01:10:24.458
THAT SOUNDS LIKE,
"OKAY TO CLIMB A LADDER"?

01:10:24.458 --> 01:10:25.750
I'M SERIOUS.

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:27.750
SOME OF MY FIREMEN PATIENTS
THINK THOSE TWO THINGS

01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:29.542
SOUND THE SAME.

01:10:29.542 --> 01:10:31.250
- UNDERSTOOD.

01:10:39.834 --> 01:10:42.250
- YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:30.542
- GUYS?

01:12:30.542 --> 01:12:34.583
- YO, YO.
WELCOME BACK, GIMPY.

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:36.750
GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, BROTHER.
- THERE HE IS.

01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:38.250
- HEY.

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:41.417
WHAT'S UP, BRO?

01:12:43.667 --> 01:12:47.458
- WELCOME BACK.

01:12:47.458 --> 01:12:49.625
- NICE, HUH?

01:12:57.959 --> 01:13:00.333
- I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU DIDN'T CALL ME.

01:13:00.333 --> 01:13:02.458
- WELL, I SPOKE
TO THEIR FATHER.

01:13:02.458 --> 01:13:04.792
- THEIR FATHER?

01:13:04.792 --> 01:13:07.625
DID HE ACTUALLY SAY
THAT HE WAS THEIR FATHER?

01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:10.625
- UH, NO...

01:13:10.625 --> 01:13:12.500
NOT SPECIFICALLY.

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.166
BUT HE WAS A MAN,

01:13:14.166 --> 01:13:16.625
AND HE CAME HERE
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT,

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:18.959
AS HE SAID, THE PICKLE
THAT THE MCCLAIN KIDS WERE IN,

01:13:18.959 --> 01:13:21.417
SO I JUST ASSUMED THAT--
- HE ACTUALLY CAME HERE?

01:13:21.417 --> 01:13:24.000
- YES.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.709
- PICKLE.

01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:30.333
I GUESS MY KIDS
DIDN'T WANT ME TO KNOW,

01:13:30.333 --> 01:13:33.333
SO THEY CONNED MY FRIEND

01:13:33.333 --> 01:13:36.834
INTO, UH, COMING.

01:13:36.834 --> 01:13:38.083
WHAT DID HE SAY?

01:13:38.083 --> 01:13:41.333
- WELL, HE SAID
THAT THEY HAD FIGURED OUT A WAY

01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:42.709
TO MAKE MONEY,

01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:47.083
AND IT WAS FOR YOU,
BECAUSE YOUR HOURS WERE CUT.

01:13:47.083 --> 01:13:49.667
THE MAN, UM, SAID
THAT THEY HAD BEEN RAISED

01:13:49.667 --> 01:13:51.500
TO SHOW UP
FOR THEIR COMMITMENTS,

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.417
AND THEY STILL HAD OBLIGATIONS
TO TWO OF OUR RESIDENTS.

01:13:54.417 --> 01:13:58.375
HE ASKED THAT THEY BE ABLE
TO FINISH OUT THEIR STORIES

01:13:58.375 --> 01:14:01.834
UNDER THE CONDITION
THAT THE READINGS WOULD BE FREE.

01:14:04.208 --> 01:14:08.125
YOU KNOW, OUR RESIDENTS
JUST ABOUT STARTED A MUTINY

01:14:08.125 --> 01:14:10.041
WHEN I SAID THE KIDS
COULDN'T COME ANYMORE.

01:14:14.041 --> 01:14:17.583
OKAY, SO HERE
ARE THEIR LAST TWO CLIENTS

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:21.208
AND WHERE TO FIND THEM.

01:14:26.208 --> 01:14:28.709
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:14:36.083 --> 01:14:39.208
- "THE LAST RAYS OF THE SUN
DISAPPEARED MUCH TOO QUICKLY.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:42.709
"I COULD BARELY MAKE MY HAND OUT
IN FRONT OF MY FACE.

01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:46.166
"AND WHEN I DID, IT SEEMED
LIKE SOMEONE ELSE'S HAND

01:14:46.166 --> 01:14:48.750
"WITH A SINISTER LIFE FORCE
OF ITS OWN.

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:51.333
"FOR WHAT SEEMED
LIKE AN ETERNITY,

01:14:51.333 --> 01:14:53.959
"MY ROCKY PRISON WAS DARK
AS BLACKEST NIGHT,

01:14:53.959 --> 01:14:57.500
AND MY THOUGHTS
WERE FILLED WITH TERROR."

01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:00.083
- I'VE BEEN LIKE THAT...

01:15:00.083 --> 01:15:02.417
LONELY AND SCARED.

01:15:02.417 --> 01:15:04.083
- ME TOO.

01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:12.333
- WHEN WERE YOU
LONELY AND SCARED, KID?

01:15:15.083 --> 01:15:18.333
- WHEN MY DAD LEFT,
I GUESS...

01:15:18.333 --> 01:15:20.208
AND NOW TOO.

01:15:20.208 --> 01:15:23.625
I'M LONELY FOR SURE, SAD.

01:15:25.625 --> 01:15:27.291
- WHY'S THAT--

01:15:27.291 --> 01:15:29.625
'CAUSE THEY TOLD YOU
YOU COULDN'T READ TO US ANYMORE?

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:32.875
- YEAH.

01:15:32.875 --> 01:15:36.500
BUT ALSO 'CAUSE OF JEFF.

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.834
HE WAS OUR RENTER.

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:40.166
WE THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA BE
MY MOM'S BOYFRIEND.

01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:42.959
BUT IT DIDN'T TURN OUT
LIKE WE FIGURED.

01:15:42.959 --> 01:15:45.792
- WHY NOT?

01:15:45.792 --> 01:15:47.583
- HE SAID HE HEALED.

01:15:47.583 --> 01:15:51.375
HE WAS READY TO GO BACK
TO HIS OWN PLACE.

01:15:51.375 --> 01:15:53.291
BUT I THINK
SHE MADE HIM LEAVE.

01:15:53.291 --> 01:15:56.208
- WHY WOULD SHE DO A THING
LIKE THAT?

01:15:58.208 --> 01:16:01.667
- I THINK SHE WAS SCARED.

01:16:01.667 --> 01:16:02.875
I MISS JEFF.

01:16:02.875 --> 01:16:05.291
HE WAS LIKE...

01:16:05.291 --> 01:16:08.500
LIKE MY DAD SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:25.375
- AFTER YOUR DAD DIED,

01:16:25.375 --> 01:16:30.000
PEOPLE TRIED
TO CONSOLE YOU.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.166
THEY'D COME UP AND SAY...

01:16:33.166 --> 01:16:36.000
HOW TRAGIC IT WAS...

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.667
HE DIED BEFORE HIS TIME.

01:16:38.667 --> 01:16:41.542
YOU REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU?

01:16:41.542 --> 01:16:43.291
- YEAH.

01:16:43.291 --> 01:16:45.333
THAT THEY WERE ALL WRONG.

01:16:45.333 --> 01:16:46.834
- EXACTLY.

01:16:46.834 --> 01:16:50.125
THEY WERE THE ONES
THAT WERE CONFUSED.

01:16:50.125 --> 01:16:54.208
HOW COULD THEY KNOW
IT WAS BEFORE HIS TIME, HUH?

01:16:54.208 --> 01:16:55.709
HOW COULD YOU KNOW THAT?

01:16:58.875 --> 01:17:01.834
MAYBE, UH, EVERYONE HAS...

01:17:01.834 --> 01:17:03.417
THEIR TIME.

01:17:03.417 --> 01:17:06.125
AND HOWEVER LONG YOU LIVE,

01:17:06.125 --> 01:17:10.917
MAYBE THAT'S THEIR TIME.

01:17:10.917 --> 01:17:13.291
YOUR DAD'S TIME WAS--

01:17:13.291 --> 01:17:17.500
- 38 YEARS AND 7 MONTHS.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.208
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S ALL FINE, BUDDY.

01:17:19.208 --> 01:17:21.375
I MEAN...

01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:23.291
I DON'T KNOW--
I GET IT.

01:17:23.291 --> 01:17:25.875
BUT HOW IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO HELP ME NOW?

01:17:25.875 --> 01:17:28.417
- YOU'RE NOT
A KID ANYMORE, JEFF.

01:17:28.417 --> 01:17:30.208
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR TIME IS.

01:17:30.208 --> 01:17:32.709
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW.

01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:39.583
I KNEW YOUR DAD
BETTER THAN ANYBODY.

01:17:39.583 --> 01:17:42.333
AND THIS I KNOW FOR THE TRUTH.

01:17:42.333 --> 01:17:44.750
SEE THAT CHAIR?

01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:48.083
IF HE WAS SITTING RIGHT THERE,
RIGHT NOW,

01:17:48.083 --> 01:17:52.667
AND YOU'D ASK HIM,
"DAD, DO I TURN MY BACK

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:56.000
ON LOVE
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID?"...

01:17:58.083 --> 01:18:00.208
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS TORN AWAY
FROM YOU,

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:05.250
YOUR DAD WOULD SAY,
"SON, DON'T RUN."

01:18:05.250 --> 01:18:07.667
HE WOULD NEVER WANT
HIS DEATH,

01:18:07.667 --> 01:18:09.959
NO MATTER HOW TERRIBLE,

01:18:09.959 --> 01:18:12.917
TO STOP YOU FROM LIVING.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.291
- "OF COURSE
THE LITTLE GIRL WAS SAD,

01:18:26.291 --> 01:18:27.625
"FOR HERSELF

01:18:27.625 --> 01:18:30.000
"AND FOR HER BROTHER.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.125
"THEY'D WORKED VERY HARD
TO KEEP THE FIREMAN WITH THEM

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.709
"SO THEY COULD HAVE
A FAMILY AGAIN.

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:38.208
"BUT SHE FELT THE SADDEST OF ALL
FOR HER MOM,

01:18:38.208 --> 01:18:41.083
"WHO HAD FINALLY FOUND
HAPPINESS

01:18:41.083 --> 01:18:44.333
"AND THEN SUDDENLY
THROWN IT AWAY.

01:18:44.333 --> 01:18:47.000
"WOULD SHE EVER BE HAPPY AGAIN?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.750
"THE GIRL HOPED SO.

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:53.709
HER MOM DESERVED IT."

01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:57.375
- OH, DEAR.

01:19:00.458 --> 01:19:02.500
- EVEN IF THEY WON'T LET US
WORK HERE,

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.542
CAN I STILL COME VISIT YOU?

01:19:04.542 --> 01:19:08.208
- OF COURSE, SWEETHEART.

01:19:08.208 --> 01:19:11.083
OF COURSE.

01:19:15.959 --> 01:19:17.166
- THAT'S TRUE.

01:19:17.166 --> 01:19:21.417
IT'S VERY WELL DONE.

01:19:21.417 --> 01:19:23.041
NICE PEOPLE.

01:19:23.041 --> 01:19:25.875
- YOU BOTH BROKE
SO MANY RULES.

01:19:25.875 --> 01:19:29.500
YOU LIED. YOU VIOLATED,
LIKE, A DOZEN LAWS.

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:33.792
YOU TOOK MONEY
FROM OLD PEOPLE.

01:19:39.125 --> 01:19:41.375
I AM SO...

01:19:43.375 --> 01:19:46.417
SO PROUD OF BOTH OF YOU.

01:20:34.625 --> 01:20:36.583
- HOW'S THE LEG?

01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:37.917
- ALMOST THERE.

01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:39.250
- BACK TO FULL DUTY?

01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:40.750
- CLOSE.

01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:50.250
- GO AHEAD.

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:53.375
ASK ME.

01:20:53.375 --> 01:20:55.792
- YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

01:20:55.792 --> 01:20:59.417
- WELL, YOU'VE BEEN COMING HERE
FOR OVER A YEAR.

01:20:59.417 --> 01:21:02.166
YOU'RE THE SPITTING IMAGE
OF YOUR DAD...

01:21:02.166 --> 01:21:03.959
THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM.

01:21:06.792 --> 01:21:09.208
- WHAT HAPPENED?

01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:15.792
- I FROZE.

01:21:17.959 --> 01:21:20.625
- THAT'S WHAT
THE AFTER-ACTION REPORT SAYS.

01:21:23.542 --> 01:21:25.792
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

01:21:25.792 --> 01:21:27.625
- I FROZE.

01:21:27.625 --> 01:21:32.375
- NO.
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

01:21:32.375 --> 01:21:35.625
YOU READ THE SIGNS, RIGHT?

01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:38.375
THE THICK, DARK SMOKE,

01:21:38.375 --> 01:21:40.542
HIGH HEAT,

01:21:40.542 --> 01:21:44.417
ANGEL FINGERS, FREE BURN.

01:21:44.417 --> 01:21:47.667
IF YOU HAD GONE IN,
YOU WOULD HAVE BURNED TOO.

01:21:47.667 --> 01:21:49.875
- WE HEARD KIDS...

01:21:49.875 --> 01:21:51.291
THE SCREAMING.

01:21:51.291 --> 01:21:53.041
HE WENT IN,
BUT I DIDN'T.

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:54.750
- NO, THERE WERE NO KIDS.

01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:57.333
MY DAD MADE A MISTAKE,
AND YOU COVERED FOR HIM.

01:21:57.333 --> 01:21:58.500
- WE HEARD KIDS.

01:21:58.500 --> 01:21:59.542
- HE MADE A MISTAKE.

01:21:59.542 --> 01:22:02.000
- LISTEN TO ME, JEFF.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.667
I MADE THE MISTAKE.

01:22:03.667 --> 01:22:07.667
- A FLASHOVER
IS MORE THAN 1,000 DEGREES...

01:22:07.667 --> 01:22:08.834
1,000.

01:22:08.834 --> 01:22:12.000
WE BOTH KNOW
YOU GOT TWO SECONDS TO GET OUT.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000
- BUT IN THOSE TWO SECONDS,
I MAY HAVE SAVED YOUR DAD.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.375
- ABOUT ZERO CHANCE.

01:22:16.375 --> 01:22:19.166
- BUT IT WASN'T ZERO.

01:22:19.166 --> 01:22:21.375
- BUT AT LEAST
ONE OF YOU LIVED.

01:22:24.041 --> 01:22:25.583
- SURVIVED.

01:22:33.583 --> 01:22:36.792
ONE OF US SURVIVED...

01:22:36.792 --> 01:22:38.583
BUT NEVER LIVED.

01:22:48.333 --> 01:22:51.750
I LEFT MY PARTNER
TO FIGHT ALONE.

01:22:54.542 --> 01:22:57.458
HE DIED INSIDE.

01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:03.583
I DIED OUTSIDE.

01:23:09.417 --> 01:23:11.583
- THANK YOU.

01:23:14.625 --> 01:23:16.083
- FOR WHAT?

01:23:17.583 --> 01:23:20.166
- FOR LETTING ME BLAME YOU
INSTEAD OF MY DAD.

01:23:48.792 --> 01:23:51.458
- COME ON, GUYS,
IT'S STILL A SCHOOL NIGHT.

01:23:51.458 --> 01:23:54.667
WE GOT TO GO NOW,
OR IT WILL BE TOO LATE.

01:23:54.667 --> 01:23:56.750
- COMING.

01:24:04.667 --> 01:24:07.291
- OPEN UP, MA'AM.
WE GOT AN EMERGENCY.

01:24:12.458 --> 01:24:13.917
WE GOT A FIREMAN DOWN.

01:24:18.834 --> 01:24:21.166
HE'S REALLY DOWN.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
- YOU WANTED A WHAT-IF.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.166
WELL, WHAT IF WE
DON'T DO THIS?

01:24:38.542 --> 01:24:40.500
WE COULD MISS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO MAKE OUR LIVES--

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:42.375
ALL OUR LIVES--
- BETTER?

01:24:42.375 --> 01:24:44.834
- MORE THAN BETTER...

01:24:44.834 --> 01:24:48.834
THE BEST.

01:24:51.333 --> 01:24:55.583
- WHAT IF EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED TO ME AND THE KIDS

01:24:55.583 --> 01:24:58.041
HAPPENED FOR A REASON?

01:24:58.041 --> 01:25:02.500
THAT REASON BEING
THAT I WOULD BE STANDING HERE...

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:04.667
AT THIS EXACT MOMENT.

01:25:07.875 --> 01:25:09.917
- YOU REMEMBER
WHAT TWO-IN MEANS?

01:25:16.417 --> 01:25:18.291
- GO IN TOGETHER,

01:25:18.291 --> 01:25:21.083
YOU STAY TOGETHER,

01:25:21.083 --> 01:25:24.542
AND YOU COME OUT TOGETHER.

01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:32.709
- AND I WANT TO HAVE THAT TIME
WITH YOU.

01:25:38.875 --> 01:25:41.542
- I WANT THAT TOO, COWBOY.

01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:48.542
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
