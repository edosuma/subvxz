♪

01:34.961 --> 01:36.562
Hey, what's up, man?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.430
Nothing, working.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.132
You're... Oh, right.

01:40.134 --> 01:42.774
I still can't believe that
people pay to watch you
play video games.

01:43.570 --> 01:44.837
Teenagers, man.

01:44.839 --> 01:46.338
But why stop there?

01:46.340 --> 01:47.940
I mean, why don't they just
watch someone watching TV
or something?

01:47.942 --> 01:49.541
Ridiculous!

01:49.543 --> 01:51.877
Thank you, MilfBlaster69.

01:52.345 --> 01:54.012
That's very cool.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.547
Hey, I forgot to tell you.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.583
I went to the post office
the other day.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.051
There's a new girl
working there,

01:59.053 --> 02:00.352
and she is very cute.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.020
<i>Uh, what was that, buddy?</i>

02:02.022 --> 02:03.422
What the hell's that?

02:03.424 --> 02:05.464
- Is that Sara?
- Yeah, she's playing from
the house.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.527
Uh... Hi, sweetie.
Can you...

02:09.530 --> 02:11.263
Aren't you supposed
to be working?

02:11.265 --> 02:13.198
<i>Yeah, here's an idea.</i>

02:13.200 --> 02:15.901
<i>Why don't you tell me about</i>
<i>this woman you got pregnant</i>
<i>at the post office?</i>

02:15.903 --> 02:19.204
No, no, no.
I was gonna suggest that
Liam should ask her out.

02:19.206 --> 02:21.206
Right? I mean,
she's not even my type.
Okay?

02:21.208 --> 02:22.307
You're my
one and only, babe.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.442
<i>Okay, you're forgiven.</i>

02:23.444 --> 02:25.144
- So what do you think?
- Pass.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.612
What are you
talking about "pass"?

02:26.614 --> 02:27.880
She's probably gonna
say yes.

02:27.882 --> 02:29.481
You know, because she
works at the post office,

02:29.483 --> 02:31.216
so she doesn't have, like,
a lot of options.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.718
A hard pass.

02:33.853 --> 02:35.287
Okay.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.788
You got it, Charlie?

02:36.790 --> 02:38.857
Yes.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.259
Thank you, sweetheart.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.760
You're welcome.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.028
I'll be over here.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.597
- Okay.
- Right over here.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.901
Maybe you and Charlie
should... date.

02:48.903 --> 02:50.068
Jesus, dude!

02:50.070 --> 02:53.205
No! Why are you so obsessed
with me dating someone?

02:53.207 --> 02:55.574
Because you can't be
a full time hag forever.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.409
"Full time"?
I am not full time.

02:57.411 --> 03:00.512
I'm more like weekends and
select week nights.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.414
- Uh-huh.
- Speaking of...

03:02.416 --> 03:03.515
What are we doing tonight?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.651
Me and my boyfriend

03:05.653 --> 03:07.753
are going to this guy,
Shane's curated salon.

03:07.755 --> 03:10.088
Ew. You just said that
way too casually.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.156
Well, it's serious.

03:11.158 --> 03:13.192
He hosts a monthly
Salon De Musique.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.660
Oh, wow.

03:14.662 --> 03:17.529
Mars, Mars, Mars, Mars,
Mars, Mars, Mars is
gonna be playing.

03:18.164 --> 03:19.565
- No.
- What?

03:20.099 --> 03:21.466
Uh-uh.

03:22.670 --> 03:26.738
Well, you know what?
At least one of you
moved today.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.106
If this is gonna
be it though,

03:28.108 --> 03:30.242
you're gonna be playing
video games and masturbating

03:30.244 --> 03:31.510
in our guesthouse
for the rest of your life.

03:31.512 --> 03:32.878
Liam does not masturbate.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.246
It's true. Not anymore.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.847
Well, you know what?

03:35.849 --> 03:37.883
Maybe you should, you know,
get the blood pumping
a little bit.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.419
- Ew, I don't need to imagine
blood and dicks together.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.287
You don't picture that?

03:42.289 --> 03:44.556
- Huh. Interesting.
- What?

03:44.558 --> 03:48.360
Shane wants Fuck Dragon
to play the salon tonight.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.895
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.864
"SOS. Can Fuck Dragon
play the salon tonight?

03:52.866 --> 03:56.401
Mars, Mars, Mars, Mars,
Mars, Mars, Mars canceled
at the last second.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.670
Please help.
Lots of people."

03:59.706 --> 04:01.273
No, I don't think so, man.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.908
A salon?

04:02.910 --> 04:04.610
You know, it's like a place
where like-minded people
get together

04:04.612 --> 04:06.011
and they sort of,
like, appreciate art.

04:06.013 --> 04:10.082
Right. And they want
Fuck Dragon to play?

04:10.084 --> 04:11.083
'Cause we're so good.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.184
We are so good.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.585
Word.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.920
I think we should do this.
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.053
Um...

04:16.055 --> 04:17.289
Come on, man. We'll bring
the fucking house down.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.490
Just like the old days.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.591
And you're gonna get out
of the guesthouse

04:19.593 --> 04:20.459
and you're gonna
talk to some people.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.793
This is a win-win for us.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.228
Hey, look, we haven't
performed since high school.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.663
What if I don't remember
the words?

04:24.665 --> 04:26.431
What if we mess up?
We're gonna
look like assholes.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.433
I... Pass.
Hard pass.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.801
Well, I already said yes.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.403
So now we gotta do it,
or Shane's gonna be furious.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.971
This is gonna be
really good, man.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.239
I'm very excited.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.641
And I gotta go work,
'cause I got
a big meeting today.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.309
I'm gonna see you tonight.
Okay?

04:37.311 --> 04:38.443
<i>♪ Fuck Dragon</i>

04:38.445 --> 04:39.945
Don't do that with your hips.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.113
Fuck Dragon.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.685
Where the fuck is Buddy?
We gotta get this thing going.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.654
The audience is
getting restless.

04:52.191 --> 04:54.226
He's gonna be here, okay?
Don't worry about it.

04:55.795 --> 04:59.331
Hi. Welcome to
the latest installment of

04:59.333 --> 05:01.533
my Salon De Musique.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.669
Slight change of plans.

05:03.671 --> 05:06.071
Mars, Mars, Mars, Mars,
Mars, Mars, Mars...

05:06.073 --> 05:08.373
Uh, they can't be here.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.741
- What?
- What?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.143
We have somebody else.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.011
Please give it up for...

05:13.813 --> 05:15.147
Fuck Dragon.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.685
- Do you know this guy?
- No.

05:21.587 --> 05:22.954
Um...

05:24.357 --> 05:26.491
Uh, check, one, two.

05:27.427 --> 05:28.894
One, two.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.399
Oh, my God.
This is embarrassing.

05:34.401 --> 05:35.734
Test one.

05:36.035 --> 05:37.469
One, two...

05:37.471 --> 05:38.870
...three.

05:43.576 --> 05:44.776
<i>Hey, man, uh...</i>

05:44.778 --> 05:46.144
<i>I'm really sorry,</i>

05:46.146 --> 05:47.846
<i>but it turns out that
I have to work late tonight.</i>

05:47.848 --> 05:49.147
<i>You know, we have
a conference call</i>

05:49.149 --> 05:50.449
<i>with these bankers in China.</i>

05:50.451 --> 05:51.817
<i>The fucking time zones,
am I right.</i>

05:51.819 --> 05:53.485
<i>Anyway, just go on
without me.</i>

05:53.487 --> 05:55.053
<i>You're gonna be fine.</i>

05:55.055 --> 05:56.121
<i>Those idiots</i>
<i>aren't gonna care</i>
<i>if I'm there or not.</i>

05:56.123 --> 05:57.956
<i>Fuck Dragon...</i>

06:10.236 --> 06:11.670
Um...

06:11.672 --> 06:15.073
So we are...
I am Fuck Dragon!

06:16.909 --> 06:19.344
This is a song about
friendship and sandwiches.

06:19.346 --> 06:22.414
Um, it'd supposed to be
a conversation
between two people,

06:22.416 --> 06:24.583
so you're gonna have to
use your imagination
a little bit.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.618
When I'm here,
it's gonna be me,

06:26.620 --> 06:28.587
so just picture me.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.489
Right? Uh...

06:30.491 --> 06:32.290
And then when I'm over here,

06:32.292 --> 06:35.560
picture like a really tall
asshole guy that's a dick
to all of his friends.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.630
- Yeah. Okay, so...
- He's funny.

Cool show.

08:14.427 --> 08:15.827
- Yeah.
- Mm.

08:17.663 --> 08:18.763
Seriously.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.665
It was hilarious.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.667
Glad you found it funny.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.336
That whole bit with
the, uh...

08:24.704 --> 08:26.204
the voicemail.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.405
So meta.

08:28.307 --> 08:29.441
Right.

08:29.443 --> 08:30.876
Yeah. No, well, yeah.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.510
I workshopped that
for a while,

08:32.513 --> 08:34.880
and I got a positive
response, so...

08:34.881 --> 08:36.780
Yeah. I mean, it really
sets up the whole

08:36.783 --> 08:40.150
loser friendless character
clinging to his past thing.

08:42.288 --> 08:43.455
Yeah.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.058
That voicemail's real?

08:47.460 --> 08:48.593
Are you ki...

08:48.595 --> 08:50.795
- I'm so sorry!
- It's okay.

08:51.163 --> 08:52.998
Oh, stupid!

08:53.000 --> 08:56.234
Well, you have to admit,
it was kind of funny.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.370
Do I? Is it?

08:58.372 --> 09:00.972
I mean, my best friend told me
he doesn't have time for me

09:00.974 --> 09:04.943
through a PA system
in a roomful of
judgmental elitists.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.645
It's a little funny.
Yeah, okay.
I'm with you.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.812
- Kind of funny.
- Yeah.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.414
- Also kind of sucks.
- Mm-hmm.

09:09.416 --> 09:12.083
I... Shit, I can't believe
you still played.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.952
I just didn't want
Shane to yell at me.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.186
He whispers when he yells.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.122
It's like a thousand
times scarier.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.490
I can see that.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.458
Well, I really liked it.

09:21.027 --> 09:22.060
Thanks.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.930
Also, I really like
PB and Js.

09:24.932 --> 09:25.897
Oh.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.699
Kind of a connoisseur.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.768
A connoisseur of PB and J?

09:29.770 --> 09:31.503
I'm no connoisseur.

09:31.505 --> 09:34.506
Buddy and I just used to
get really high and want
PB and J, that's all.

09:34.508 --> 09:38.109
Ooh. I'm PB and jelly.

09:39.612 --> 09:40.812
Like jealous?

09:40.814 --> 09:42.180
No, I understood it.
I just didn't wanna...

09:42.182 --> 09:43.748
- That was just bad.
- That was just bad. Yeah.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.650
Don't explain the jokes.
Okay.

09:45.652 --> 09:48.019
Um, well...

09:48.021 --> 09:49.955
- Cool show.
- Thank you.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.756
Thanks. I appreciate that.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.959
Hey, here's to my only fan,

09:53.961 --> 09:55.427
and apparently my
new best friend.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.295
Mm. I am Beck.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.797
Liam.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

10:02.002 --> 10:05.904
So Bobby just got us
invited to this warehouse
party downtown,.

10:05.906 --> 10:09.207
Apparently there's
a hundred year old leprechaun

10:09.209 --> 10:13.578
that's drinking Rose out of
an ice dick lute.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.180
But like a real leprechaun.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.982
- Not a fake leprechaun.
- I get it. I get it.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.818
- I mean...
- Really, it's too much.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.419
Oh.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.988
Hi.

10:22.990 --> 10:27.092
Cool, guys. I think
Liam and I are just gonna go

10:27.094 --> 10:28.960
grab some tacos or something.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.296
Oh, cool. You and, um...

10:31.298 --> 10:32.831
Liam!

10:33.799 --> 10:35.000
Liam. Hi, Liam.

10:35.002 --> 10:38.036
Okay, that's fine.
Thanks.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.739
Yeah. Maybe I'll just,
like, see you later, or...

10:40.741 --> 10:42.407
- Yeah. Bye, Liam.
- Maybe...

10:42.409 --> 10:43.808
Nice to meet you guys.

10:44.110 --> 10:44.976
Bye.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.211
Have fun!

10:47.013 --> 10:48.580
You like tacos, right?

10:50.750 --> 10:52.317
- So, like, one day...
- Mm...

10:52.985 --> 10:54.386
We're all playing <i>Mario Kart,</i>

10:54.388 --> 10:57.122
and the next,
Buddy and Sara are married,

10:57.124 --> 10:59.924
and they have a house,
and they look forward to
trips to West Elm.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.594
It's the same thing
with Franklin. I mean...

11:02.596 --> 11:04.062
He's not even
Franklin anymore.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.097
He's just like this
weird version of Franklin.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.199
He's like Bobby's
boyfriend Franklin.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.468
And on the off chance
I can get
Buddy and Sara to play

11:10.470 --> 11:11.469
<i>Mario Kart</i> with me,

11:11.471 --> 11:13.171
they won't even shoot
each other with shells.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.273
Which means they're saving
their shells for me.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.641
- Oh, God.
- I mean, that's not fair.

11:16.643 --> 11:17.842
No.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.044
It's like I'm just
trying to stay alive

11:19.046 --> 11:20.979
while everyone is
cruising to the finish.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.048
Dude, we are
bringing up the rear,

11:23.050 --> 11:25.884
slipping on banana peels
as everyone else is
laughing at us.

11:26.385 --> 11:28.286
Right. Hey, man.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.721
- Can we have two more?
- Yeah, sure.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.456
- Thanks.
- You know what?

11:31.458 --> 11:32.791
I don't even want that.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.092
- No more?
- Hmm?

11:34.094 --> 11:35.760
- No tacos?
- Oh, no, no.

11:35.762 --> 11:38.163
Yes. I mean, yes.
Always tacos.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.065
I mean, I don't want to
be that, you know,

11:40.067 --> 11:42.000
Beck in a relationship
version of Beck.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.002
I just wanna be Beck.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.503
You know?
Beck Beck.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.771
Beck Beck's cool.

11:46.773 --> 11:48.039
Why change that?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.441
- Exactly.
- Thanks, man.

11:51.610 --> 11:55.046
Hey, you know what?
If I played you in <i>Mario Kart,</i>

11:55.048 --> 11:56.648
I'd freakin' blast you
with shells.

11:56.650 --> 11:59.551
Dude, that's like
the nicest thing anyone's
ever said to me.

12:00.352 --> 12:02.053
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.891
It's like feeling this
pressure from people

12:06.893 --> 12:08.727
who want us to find someone
and get in a relationship.

12:08.729 --> 12:09.794
Oh, of course.

12:09.796 --> 12:12.731
Hi, I'm Beck.
Wanna get married?

12:12.733 --> 12:15.100
- Fuck that, man. Right?
- Pathetic. Mm-hmm.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.168
I like being, like,
a weird loner guy.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.170
You know what?

12:18.871 --> 12:20.472
It really suits you.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.874
We should hang out.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.909
And be weird
loner guys together.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.344
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.179
- Okay.
- Let's freaking
get out of here.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.547
I mean, go away for
the weekend.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.850
- All right.
Where are we going?
- I don't know.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.818
Someplace cool.
It's workable.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.253
Sure.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.022
And just some place
away from all
the shell-hoarding,

12:38.024 --> 12:40.592
boyfriend, girlfriend
versions of people people.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.060
- Oh, I'm down for that.
- Yeah?

12:42.062 --> 12:43.895
- Oh, I'm down.
- Okay.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.463
Okay. Let's play a game.

12:45.465 --> 12:46.664
Uh-oh, he's moving.

12:46.666 --> 12:47.866
- On the count of three...
- Yeah.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.033
We'll both say a place.

12:49.035 --> 12:51.002
Same place, that's where
we're gonna go.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.403
- Oh, I like this.
- Yeah?

12:52.405 --> 12:53.538
- Yeah, do it.
- Okay.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.506
- Let's go.
- I'll start?

12:54.508 --> 12:55.473
Hit me, come on.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.108
- One, three...
- Two...

12:57.110 --> 12:58.610
- Disneyland.
- Switzerland.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.044
- Shit.
- That's close.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.480
- So...
- What about the desert?

13:03.883 --> 13:06.017
You know what?
I've never been to
the desert.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.485
- Yeah?
- That's crazy.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.787
- Yes, the desert.
- Okay.

13:08.789 --> 13:09.921
Let's go to the desert.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.456
We'll get a house,
we'll hang out.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.659
Like a couple of cool
independent people people.

13:14.661 --> 13:15.727
Perfect.

13:15.729 --> 13:17.896
- Logistics.
- Talk to me.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.664
- Two bedroom.
- Duh.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.099
- And a pool.
- Double duh.

13:21.101 --> 13:24.002
- And an espresso machine.
- Sold.

13:24.904 --> 13:26.137
When do you wanna go?

13:26.705 --> 13:27.972
- So, to recap.
- Mm-hmm.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.108
We're just two totally normal,
totally cool,

13:30.110 --> 13:31.509
independent people people

13:31.511 --> 13:34.045
doing our own totally
normal, totally cool

13:34.047 --> 13:36.014
independent
people people thing
together.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.515
Exactly.
No funny business.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.652
Thank you.
No deep conversations over
storied pasts.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.954
Yeah, right.
While looking up into
the night sky.

13:42.956 --> 13:46.858
This is called a friendship
friend trip.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.927
A friendship
friend trip.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.195
I like it.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.362
It's a little hard to say,
we'll workshop.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.697
- I kind of felt that, too.
- Okay.

13:52.699 --> 13:53.698
We'll work on it.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.700
Allow me.

14:03.309 --> 14:04.642
Thank you.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.645
- Titties.
- Got it?

14:07.647 --> 14:08.746
Yes.

14:09.615 --> 14:11.049
Friendship friend trip!

14:15.120 --> 14:16.840
We'll workshop that, too.
I'll work on that.

14:22.161 --> 14:25.864
Okay. Is it more
like a cactus
or Cameron Diaz?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.232
Cactus.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.034
Cactus or...

14:30.036 --> 14:31.502
plastic bag?

14:31.504 --> 14:32.737
Plastic bag.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.038
Okay.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.773
Plastic bag or...

14:37.776 --> 14:38.910
a condom?

14:38.912 --> 14:41.012
Ooh, ooh. Uh...

14:41.014 --> 14:42.647
Mm... condom.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.882
- Ee...
- Yep.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.250
Okay.

14:46.018 --> 14:47.685
Condom or...

14:47.687 --> 14:50.054
A balloon animal?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.422
Definitely balloon animal.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.290
- Really?
- Yep.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.026
Okay. A balloon animal or...

14:56.028 --> 14:58.830
Oh! A child-sized
froggy inner tube.

14:58.832 --> 14:59.964
Got it!

14:59.966 --> 15:01.466
She got it!

15:01.468 --> 15:03.101
- Come on,
this is what you picked?
- Yeah.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.736
What else am I gonna pick
in the car?

15:04.738 --> 15:06.037
That's freaking true.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.745
Well... made it out
alive.

15:14.513 --> 15:16.814
- That bad?
- Oh, yeah.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.650
Grossest bathroom ever.

15:18.652 --> 15:21.085
I believe someone was
recently murdered in there.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.687
Yeah, I could have
told you that.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.522
Wait a second.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.724
Is that why you
brought me out here?

15:26.726 --> 15:28.192
No!

15:28.194 --> 15:30.929
The Rest Stop Killer

Internet.

16:33.525 --> 16:34.525
Nice.

16:36.428 --> 16:38.830
I think they said something
about a rock.

16:38.832 --> 16:42.200
You mean, one of those
rocky highway thingies?

16:42.202 --> 16:44.769
Right. To find it,
I have to...

16:55.814 --> 16:57.882
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:58.384 --> 16:59.650
Found it.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.552
- Oh.
- Kenefick rock.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.557
- Uh?
- Mm-hmm.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.059
Oh, yeah.
As good as the photos?

17:08.060 --> 17:09.727
Yeah. Better.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.194
Oh, heck yeah.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.665
- Jellyfish that out.
- Jellyfishing. Okay.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.667
Wow. What a terrible view.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.470
Totally.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.472
You really found a house
with an espresso machine?

17:21.473 --> 17:23.074
It was one
of the requirements.

17:23.076 --> 17:26.010
So obviously I'll take
the big room, because
I am bigger than you.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.278
You a-hole.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.780
Fine, I'll take
the small room

17:28.782 --> 17:31.315
that's shitty and not at all
cool and nice.

17:32.684 --> 17:34.786
So who do you think
owns this house?

17:38.290 --> 17:41.692
Uh, I don't know.
Middle aged man, woman,
two kids.

17:41.694 --> 17:44.362
Boring. Try again.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.965
I think it's the granddaughter
of the dude who invented
the bendy straw.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.803
You're jumping on the bed?

17:51.805 --> 17:53.037
Nope.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.806
Are you?

17:54.808 --> 17:56.240
No.

17:56.508 --> 17:57.575
Aha!

17:58.110 --> 17:59.577
Proof.

17:59.978 --> 18:01.412
Hmm.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.213
Hiya!

18:02.215 --> 18:03.347
Oh, shit!

18:03.349 --> 18:04.916
- You okay?
- Yeah.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.952
Uh, just checking
for monsters.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.821
Um, you hungry?

18:11.957 --> 18:12.990
Let's play a game.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.025
Okay.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.093
Do you know how to play
the face game?

18:15.095 --> 18:16.694
Um, no.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.664
I just give you a direction
and then you do it.

18:19.666 --> 18:20.898
- Okay, go.
- Okay.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.135
Cross your eyes.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.536
- Okay.
- Wait, how about that?

18:25.538 --> 18:28.005
Oh, don't do that.
100% don't do that.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.407
It's advanced. I'm sorry.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.175
Okay. So far so good.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.144
Stick out your tongue.

18:33.146 --> 18:36.314
So good.
Now make your eyes
like super wide.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.649
And you try to show
as much teeth as possible.

18:38.651 --> 18:39.851
- Uh?
- Mm-hmm.

18:39.853 --> 18:41.519
Okay. Hold that pose.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.620
Oh, my God.
You're so good at this game.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.255
You're like winning
at this game.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.124
- How is this a game?
- It's not a game.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.658
- So good for that.
- It's not a game?

18:47.660 --> 18:50.194
- That's blackmail.
- What the hell is that?

18:50.196 --> 18:51.462
No, get rid.
Delete, delete, delete.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.231
All right.
You wanna do me?
You could do me.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.732
I definitely will
be doing that,

18:54.734 --> 18:56.734
but right after we have
two more of these.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.636
Truth. I like where
your head's at.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.304
You wanna get the same thing?
Or you want something else?

19:00.306 --> 19:01.706
I don't know.

19:01.708 --> 19:02.874
What is that?

19:04.576 --> 19:07.311
Uh-oh. Somebody bites
his nails.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.413
Yeah, sorry.
I try not to.

19:09.415 --> 19:11.516
My mom says it makes me
look neurotic.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.884
I think it's kinda cool.

19:12.886 --> 19:15.853
Makes it look like you're
really concentrating.

19:15.855 --> 19:20.291
Like laser sharp focus
on picking the right drink.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.727
Actually this one time
in college,

19:22.729 --> 19:26.364
Buddy and I got these fake IDs
from a weird goth kid,

19:26.366 --> 19:28.399
and we took it to this
liquor store on campus

19:28.401 --> 19:30.034
that would take any ID.

19:30.036 --> 19:33.004
So we go.
It's Buddy. It's me.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.173
Eighteen-year-old
computer nerds,
we didn't know what to get,

19:35.175 --> 19:36.774
so we got
a bottle of cognac,

19:36.776 --> 19:38.776
because we thought
it sounded cool.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.045
And then we brought it
back to our dorm

19:41.047 --> 19:43.047
and we mixed it with
Half and Half.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.248
Why would you do that?

19:44.250 --> 19:45.283
It's the only thing we had
in our fridge.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.350
That's the worst.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.451
I've never been sicker
in my life.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.020
Yeah, that's
absolutely disgusting.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.022
Oh, my God.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.860
I really like that "mm-hmm"
thing you do.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.295
What? What "mm-hmm" thing?

19:57.297 --> 20:00.765
You say "mm-hmm" when
there's a natural pause
in the conversation.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.267
- Do I?
- Yeah.

20:03.269 --> 20:06.537
- You don't realize that?
- No. I... I hate that.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.439
I like it.
It means you're
paying attention.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.807
You're really invested

20:09.809 --> 20:13.010
in the epic tale of
Liam and the Bottle of Cognac.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.612
You made it pretty epic.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.847
You kids need another drink?

20:16.849 --> 20:18.449
Uh... yes.

20:18.984 --> 20:20.685
May I have...

20:20.687 --> 20:22.553
a cognac and
Half and Half?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.322
Oof! We're doing this?

20:24.324 --> 20:25.389
- Oh, yeah.
- You sure?

20:25.391 --> 20:27.358
Definitely. Go.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.661
Two cognacs and
Half and Half, please, Mary.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.032
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mary.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.068
- Mm-hmm. Hates us.
- Hates us.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.703
- Hates us so much.
- Dead stare.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.104
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.414
What's up there, kiddo?

20:52.217 --> 20:54.885
Looks like you're having
a good time out there. Yeah?

20:54.887 --> 20:59.123
Although you might want to
take it easy on the nachos.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.158
Just a suggestion from
an old friend.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.733
<i>What about me, Liam?</i>

21:08.735 --> 21:10.635
<i>What about me, Liam?</i>

21:10.637 --> 21:12.069
<i>You don't love me anymore.</i>

21:12.071 --> 21:14.005
<i>Is that it?</i>

21:14.007 --> 21:18.276
I'm sure you'll be able to
work on that thigh gap
before swimsuit season, huh?

21:18.278 --> 21:19.844
But don't worry.
You know what?

21:19.846 --> 21:21.979
Some guys like
a little extra cushion

21:21.981 --> 21:23.281
for the pushing.
Oh, no!

21:23.283 --> 21:25.983
Come on, Beck.
Don't be so sensitive.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.353
<i>Liam?</i>

21:29.355 --> 21:31.255
<i>Uh, Liam?</i>

21:31.257 --> 21:32.623
<i>Liam!</i>

21:34.059 --> 21:36.127
<i>Liam! Ow!</i>

21:47.339 --> 21:49.140
You guys still working
on these nachos?

21:49.142 --> 21:50.207
- No.
- Nope.

21:50.209 --> 21:52.109
Okay. Well, you want me
to wrap them up?

21:52.111 --> 21:53.344
- No.
- No.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.912
Geez. Okay.

22:03.855 --> 22:05.589
Can I ask you
a serious question?

22:09.194 --> 22:12.229
Do you want anymore
cognac and Half And Half?

22:13.131 --> 22:14.265
Yes, please.

22:14.267 --> 22:16.000
- Yeah?
- Yes.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.803
Two more cognac and
Half And Halfs, please.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.071
- Please.
- Please.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.108
I think she just
smiled at me.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.309
Yeah. She loves us now, right?

22:25.311 --> 22:27.078
- She's coming around.
- She's coming around, right?

22:27.080 --> 22:29.080
I think she's coming around.

Are you enjoying
the snowball dance?

24:08.046 --> 24:09.513
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

24:09.515 --> 24:11.282
I saw you,

24:11.284 --> 24:13.117
over here, looking at me...

24:13.485 --> 24:14.718
over there.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.188
Well, that's because
I'm a shy nerdy guy

24:17.190 --> 24:20.324
who stands in the corner,
afraid to ask the pretty
girl to dance.

24:20.326 --> 24:22.593
Aw, come on, man.

24:22.595 --> 24:24.395
It's the 90s.

24:24.397 --> 24:26.730
Now the girls ask
the boys to dance.

24:29.334 --> 24:30.801
Don't be afraid.

24:30.803 --> 24:34.238

24:45.451 --> 24:47.785
You can step in
a little closer.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.753
What about Sister Agnes?

24:50.088 --> 24:50.988
Who?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.523
- Sister Agnes?
- Who's Sister Agnes?

24:52.525 --> 24:56.727
Well, Sister Agnes says
we need to leave room
for the Holy Spirit.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.029
Oh, that's right.

24:59.031 --> 25:00.631
I forgot this was
a Catholic school.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.066
Yeah, we're like
super strict here.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.100
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

25:03.102 --> 25:06.470
Well, I wouldn't worry
about Sister Agnes.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.105
I mean, she's probably off

25:08.107 --> 25:12.109
catching Jimmy O'Sullivan
smoking cigarettes
in the boys' room.

25:12.111 --> 25:13.277
Oh, Jimmy's so bad.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.712
He's the baddest guy.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.382
So...

25:18.384 --> 25:19.683
You ever been Frenched?

25:19.685 --> 25:22.853
What? Yeah, like...

25:22.855 --> 25:26.190
- A hundred times probably.
- Wow.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.359
- Okay, I've practiced
on my hand.
- Mm-hmm.

25:29.561 --> 25:30.995
Have you?

25:30.997 --> 25:32.630
I mean...

25:32.632 --> 25:34.899
I'm like a really good Frencher.

25:35.734 --> 25:38.135
Like, seriously next level
Frenching.

25:38.137 --> 25:41.772
Like, the best Frencher
in the whole school. So...

25:43.441 --> 25:44.909
Yeah.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.710
I mean, I could teach you.

25:48.313 --> 25:49.880
Yeah, okay.

25:50.448 --> 25:52.283
Like, now.

25:52.285 --> 25:54.251
- Right now?
- Yeah.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.719
- Okay.
- Okay, you ready?

25:55.721 --> 25:57.087
Okay, hold on once second.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.322
Yeah.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.159

26:02.161 --> 26:03.727
- Smooth move.
- Mm.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.696
Okay, so...

26:06.131 --> 26:07.698
First thing.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.466
You're gonna take
a deep breath.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.802
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.203
Real deep breath.

26:14.339 --> 26:16.407
And you can let it out.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.375
- This is like to prep.
- Oh, okay.

26:18.377 --> 26:19.777
This is to prep yourself.

26:20.345 --> 26:21.478
And...

26:21.480 --> 26:24.114
Okay, now it gets
a little tricky.

26:24.116 --> 26:27.184
You're gonna stick out
your tongue,

26:27.186 --> 26:28.919
and put it in my mouth,

26:28.921 --> 26:32.723
and swirl it around
as fast as you can.

26:32.725 --> 26:33.924
That sounds awesome.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.326
Like really freaking fast.

26:35.328 --> 26:36.894
Okay.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.762

in a minivan.

28:00.478 --> 28:01.879
So...

28:01.881 --> 28:03.981
- Yeah.
- I should...

28:03.983 --> 28:06.050

school girl uniform right now?

28:15.394 --> 28:17.027
Yeah. 100%.

28:18.763 --> 28:20.664
I'm gonna look at
your yearbook photo

28:20.666 --> 28:23.300
and listen to this song like
a hundred times this summer.

28:24.269 --> 28:25.636
Cool.

28:25.638 --> 28:27.004
Totally cool.

28:27.338 --> 28:28.806
Uh...

28:28.808 --> 28:31.475
I guess I'll see you
in high school?

28:32.777 --> 28:34.478
- See you in high school.
- Mm.

28:40.785 --> 28:42.286
Good night.

29:17.822 --> 29:19.089
Whoa.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.391
Whoa. What up, sleepyhead?

29:21.393 --> 29:23.060
What do we have here?

29:23.062 --> 29:25.095
I'm currently making my
world-famous eggs

29:25.097 --> 29:28.298
that are guaranteed to
knock your goddamn socks off.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.633
Pshew!

29:29.635 --> 29:31.401
- Okay.
- You like eggs, right?

29:31.403 --> 29:34.338
Yeah. Do I like eggs?
Of course I like eggs!

29:34.340 --> 29:35.172
Right.

29:35.174 --> 29:36.974
All right. How about this?

29:36.976 --> 29:39.476
I make one of my
world-famous lattes,

29:39.478 --> 29:41.545
guaranteed to knock
your goddamn socks off,

29:41.547 --> 29:44.948
then we'll both be sockless
and one step closer to
getting in that pool.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.283
I like it. I like it.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.551
Good.

29:49.020 --> 29:50.821
Permission to
compliment you.

29:50.823 --> 29:53.457
Mm. Permission granted.

29:53.459 --> 29:56.527
You look really pretty
with your hair all crazy
like that.

29:56.529 --> 29:59.563
Whoa, watch out now.

29:59.565 --> 30:04.802
Well,
you look really pretty
in that apron.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.103
It's 'cause real men
wear pink.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.437
- Oh, do they?
- So...

30:07.439 --> 30:08.605
- Real man.
- Okay.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.407
- I wear pink.
- Do they?

30:10.409 --> 30:11.575
I guess I forgot.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.310
Come on...

30:15.747 --> 30:16.980
Hey, you need help?
Okay.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.382
You got it?

30:18.384 --> 30:19.249
Bunny ears.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.717
I do a loop it.
Loop it, scoop it.

30:20.719 --> 30:22.119
Oh, okay,
I'll loop it.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.454
- Not too tight.
- Just... Okay.
Just give me a second.

30:24.456 --> 30:25.989
- Okay.
- Perfect.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.491
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

30:31.262 --> 30:32.296
Mm.

30:34.532 --> 30:35.933
Mm. Delish.

30:35.935 --> 30:38.268
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:38.270 --> 30:40.504
Somehow your socks
are still on.

30:42.874 --> 30:47.311
Holy cow! Watch out.

30:47.313 --> 30:51.648
Whoo! My socks have somehow
been knocked clean off.

30:51.650 --> 30:53.150
There we go.
That's better.

30:53.718 --> 30:55.152
Hold on.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.553
Mm-hmm.

30:58.323 --> 30:59.656
What you got?

30:59.658 --> 31:01.091
- Mm-mm.
- What you got?

31:01.093 --> 31:02.659
- Uh-oh. Do you feel that?
- Uh-huh.

31:02.661 --> 31:04.294
Do you feel that? Boom!

31:04.829 --> 31:06.163
Boom!

31:06.764 --> 31:08.398
We left each other sockless.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.566
Wow.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.034
It's amazing.

31:13.938 --> 31:15.706
Hey, you got a...

31:15.708 --> 31:17.040
You got a little...

31:17.042 --> 31:19.243
- What?
- I don't know. Come here.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.677
You got a little something.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.312
Let me see.

31:25.350 --> 31:26.383
Did you get it?

31:26.851 --> 31:28.518
Yeah, almost.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.920
Actually, you know what?

31:29.922 --> 31:31.488
You got something, too.

31:43.601 --> 31:44.668
Hmm.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.573
- There we go.
- Got it.

32:01.219 --> 32:02.552
Um...

32:04.088 --> 32:05.722
Thank you for...

32:06.824 --> 32:08.625
for cooking, but...

32:09.661 --> 32:11.728
I actually don't like eggs.

32:12.697 --> 32:13.797
Oh.

32:14.565 --> 32:15.565
Okay.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.502
Yeah.

32:21.239 --> 32:23.774
You know what?
I don't drink coffee.

32:25.476 --> 32:26.510
Oh.

32:29.013 --> 32:30.314
It's okay.

32:33.051 --> 32:34.751
- Huh.
- Mm-hmm.

32:39.590 --> 32:40.691
Cool.

32:41.893 --> 32:43.360
Cool.

32:51.736 --> 32:54.838
<i>So I remember reading</i>
<i>this thing in school.</i>

32:54.840 --> 32:56.440

32:56.442 --> 33:00.043

four arms, four legs,</i>

33:00.045 --> 33:02.346

33:02.348 --> 33:07.484

33:12.958 --> 33:14.057
Whoa.

33:14.059 --> 33:15.959
That's a lot of pressure.

33:15.961 --> 33:17.627
It scared the shit
out of me.

33:21.599 --> 33:24.368
Like, what if your other half
is born in Laos?

33:24.370 --> 33:27.571
I only found out that country
even exists like last week.

33:27.573 --> 33:29.840

my other half there?</i>

33:29.842 --> 33:32.209

33:34.046 --> 33:37.447

34:58.997 --> 35:00.831
- Thank you, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

35:00.833 --> 35:02.399
Come on in.

35:03.334 --> 35:06.036
Wow.

35:06.038 --> 35:08.738
I cleared out my three
top drawers for you.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.240
- Babe!
- Mm-hmm.

35:10.242 --> 35:11.975
- I got you something.
- What?

35:14.712 --> 35:16.613
Aw, babe!

35:17.281 --> 35:19.182
You shouldn't have.

35:19.184 --> 35:20.250
Wanted to.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.485
- What is it?
- You'll see.

35:21.487 --> 35:22.686
- Tell me, tell me, tell me...
- You'll see.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.688
You'll see. You'll see.
You'll see.

35:28.593 --> 35:30.327
What!

35:30.329 --> 35:31.895
I made it myself.

35:31.897 --> 35:33.830
I love green and yellow.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.499
- May I?
- Yes, please.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.606
I'll never take it off.

35:42.907 --> 35:44.141
Good.

35:44.143 --> 35:45.442
Good.

35:48.813 --> 35:49.846
- Hey.
- Mm.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.215
What was little Liam like?

35:52.217 --> 35:55.218
Well, despite my hulking
physical presence,

35:55.220 --> 35:56.720
I was a pretty small kid
growing up.

35:56.722 --> 35:59.756
Aw! Little baby Liam.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.391
I wanna know him.

36:03.761 --> 36:05.795
What did he wanna be
when he grew up?

36:09.033 --> 36:10.033
Football star.

36:10.635 --> 36:11.468
- What?
- Mm.

36:11.470 --> 36:12.969
- You played football?
- No.

36:12.971 --> 36:13.970
God, no.

36:13.972 --> 36:15.338
My mom didn't let me.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.841
Said I was too small and
the other kids would hurt me.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.176
I don't like that.

36:19.178 --> 36:21.211
She bought me Nintendo.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.146
And then I developed
a good old-fashioned

36:23.148 --> 36:24.781
fear of people
bigger than me.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.716
Come on.

36:26.718 --> 36:29.352
What did your dad have
to say about all that?

36:30.688 --> 36:33.490
Nothing.
My dad died when I was a baby.

36:33.958 --> 36:34.958
Oh.

36:35.760 --> 36:36.793
I'm sorry.

36:36.795 --> 36:39.496
It's okay,
It was a heart attack.

36:39.498 --> 36:42.499
My mom always said that
she would try to tell him to
take better care of himself,

36:42.501 --> 36:44.501
but he was too stubborn
to listen.

36:45.403 --> 36:48.004
So growing up,
any time I disagreed with her,

36:48.006 --> 36:49.339
she would say,

36:49.341 --> 36:51.474
"You know who else
thought I was wrong?"

36:51.642 --> 36:53.076
No!

36:53.078 --> 36:55.078
- Mm-hmm.
- Whoa! That's...

36:55.080 --> 36:56.980
That's heavy.

36:56.982 --> 37:00.817
I grew up pretty much
thinking everything
would kill me.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.852
Oh, my God.

37:04.589 --> 37:05.789
Ugh!

37:07.692 --> 37:09.960
Sounds cruel, but,

37:09.962 --> 37:12.896
sometimes I think I'd be
better of if my dad were dead.

37:12.898 --> 37:13.964
What?

37:14.532 --> 37:15.799
Yeah.

37:15.801 --> 37:17.100
He, um...

37:17.102 --> 37:20.370
He had an affair
when I was like six.

37:20.372 --> 37:21.938
Some younger girl.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.573
No!

37:23.908 --> 37:25.108
Mm-hmm.

37:27.011 --> 37:29.746
My parents tried to be
really discreet about it.

37:32.350 --> 37:35.118
My mom had gained
all this weight, and...

37:35.120 --> 37:36.753
my dad just...

37:38.256 --> 37:40.090
treated her different...

37:40.092 --> 37:41.324
like, physically.

37:41.326 --> 37:44.828
He would only kiss her
on the top of her head.

37:46.831 --> 37:49.032
Little things like that.

37:49.034 --> 37:53.737
And then when it
finally came out
with this younger girl...

37:54.805 --> 37:56.039
My mom learned about it.

37:56.041 --> 37:57.607
She didn't even...

37:58.409 --> 38:01.144
She acted like she
didn't even care.

38:01.146 --> 38:04.447
Like she just completely
shut down,

38:04.449 --> 38:06.716
like a zombie. Like...

38:08.786 --> 38:10.086
And then, I just

38:10.888 --> 38:12.722
tried my best to

38:13.658 --> 38:16.059
play make believe
with my best friend

38:16.827 --> 38:17.994
and avoid them.

38:18.896 --> 38:19.996
Shit, Beck.

38:21.866 --> 38:22.866
Yeah.

38:24.468 --> 38:27.470
Then he ended up running
off with the other girl.

38:27.472 --> 38:29.439
And that was it.

38:29.441 --> 38:30.940
Did you ever see him again?

38:34.045 --> 38:35.745
Yeah, actually.

38:37.982 --> 38:41.117
When I was in college
he got in touch with me.

38:42.787 --> 38:45.355
And he asked me to
go out to lunch.

38:45.357 --> 38:46.656
Did you go?

38:46.991 --> 38:48.425
Mm-hmm.

38:50.728 --> 38:51.895
But...

38:53.464 --> 38:56.032
Sorry, I haven't talked about
this in a long time.

38:59.603 --> 39:01.905
When I got
to the restaurant...

39:05.976 --> 39:08.712
I saw him sitting there
in there window, and...

39:09.280 --> 39:10.480
um...

39:10.482 --> 39:12.749
He was really old...

39:12.751 --> 39:15.251
and fat...

39:15.253 --> 39:16.786
and bald.

39:16.788 --> 39:18.021
And he looked...

39:19.290 --> 39:21.124
He looked...

39:21.126 --> 39:24.060
so nervous, and I just...

39:24.895 --> 39:27.831
I was mad and angry
and grossed out.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.867
I just didn't wanna fucking
deal with it, so I...

39:32.938 --> 39:36.005
I left. I just...
I didn't go in.

39:37.108 --> 39:38.475
Wow.

39:38.809 --> 39:39.843
And that was it?

39:40.778 --> 39:42.412
Yeah.

39:42.414 --> 39:44.848
Then I went back to...

39:44.850 --> 39:47.917
distracting myself with
my old childhood friend.

39:49.954 --> 39:51.955
I'm glad your friend
was there for you.

39:53.324 --> 39:55.525
Mm, yeah.

39:55.527 --> 39:57.160
Only this time,

39:57.162 --> 39:59.596
out make-believe involved

39:59.598 --> 40:02.665
some, like, heavy drinking
and drugs.

40:02.667 --> 40:03.900
Stop!

40:03.902 --> 40:05.101
Okay.

40:05.103 --> 40:07.737
Beck, when do we get to
the part where you're the...

40:07.739 --> 40:10.106
smart, beautiful, funny,

40:10.108 --> 40:13.410
amazing Beck in the hammock
with the handsome gentleman?

40:13.412 --> 40:15.345
God. Well...

40:15.347 --> 40:17.380
After I failed out
of school...

40:17.382 --> 40:18.982
Stop.

40:18.984 --> 40:23.553
I started slowly
crawling out of this hole
I had dug for myself.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.388
I got a job
at the coffee shop,

40:25.390 --> 40:27.090
and I met Franklin.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.227
We hit it off, so...

40:31.229 --> 40:36.232
Than I guess,
then I became the...

40:37.701 --> 40:39.235
Smart...

40:39.237 --> 40:43.206
Pretty...
whatever you just said,
laying in the hammock

40:43.208 --> 40:46.075
with a very
handsome gentleman.

40:47.812 --> 40:49.112
I've never

40:49.447 --> 40:50.747
been so happy

40:50.749 --> 40:52.882
to be a handsome gentleman
in a hammock.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.017
Mm.

43:55.934 --> 43:58.101
What's going on here?

43:58.103 --> 43:59.569
What? What are you
talking about?

43:59.571 --> 44:02.372
Well, what is this?

44:02.906 --> 44:03.806
Oh.

44:03.808 --> 44:05.441
- The suit?
- Yeah.

44:06.143 --> 44:07.210
The suit stays on.

44:08.278 --> 44:10.346
Like... the whole time?

44:10.348 --> 44:11.748
All the time.

44:12.349 --> 44:13.583
Why?

44:13.585 --> 44:15.752
So no one ever sees me naked.

44:15.754 --> 44:17.120
- No one?
- No one.

44:17.122 --> 44:19.255
- What about you?
- What about me?

44:19.257 --> 44:20.423
Well, I mean, do you?

44:20.425 --> 44:23.026
No. Obviously. I said no one.

44:23.028 --> 44:24.460
Okay, so...

44:24.462 --> 44:25.962
Never take the suit off?

44:25.964 --> 44:27.196
Correct.

44:27.198 --> 44:28.765
Even in the shower?

44:28.767 --> 44:32.502
No. Because
it's a <i>bathing</i> suit.

44:32.903 --> 44:34.270
Oh.

44:34.272 --> 44:36.506
Yeah, okay. No, I guess
that makes sense.

44:37.708 --> 44:39.308
Well, do you wash it?

44:39.310 --> 44:40.610
Do I wash it?

44:40.612 --> 44:41.778
Of course I wash it.

44:41.780 --> 44:43.579
What do you think I am,
a crazy person?

44:43.581 --> 44:44.914
When?

44:45.416 --> 44:47.517
When I'm in the shower.

44:47.519 --> 44:50.019
Right. Yeah, okay.

44:50.955 --> 44:56.025
And occasionally,
I close my eyes
and Febreze the inside.

44:56.994 --> 44:58.027
Huh.

45:02.933 --> 45:05.001
- Yeah, fuck it. Okay.
- Okay.

45:09.473 --> 45:10.707
Oh, shit.

45:21.719 --> 45:22.952
I love you.

45:24.621 --> 45:26.322
I love you, too, Eden.

45:30.327 --> 45:31.427
What?

45:33.564 --> 45:35.031
Did I just say "Eden"?

45:36.133 --> 45:37.200
Mm-hmm.

45:41.505 --> 45:43.539
Oh! I'm so sorry.

45:48.679 --> 45:50.046
Who's Eden?

45:51.548 --> 45:54.050
She was my last girlfriend.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.285
Mm-hmm.

45:56.287 --> 45:57.887
Of seven years.

45:58.589 --> 45:59.989
Oh, wow.

46:00.390 --> 46:01.958
And I...

46:01.960 --> 46:05.595
kind of haven't been with
anyone since, so...

46:07.197 --> 46:08.264
It's fine.

46:12.269 --> 46:14.437
I am so sorry.

46:16.306 --> 46:18.141
It's fine. Just...

46:18.776 --> 46:20.610
I don't know.
What can you do?

46:28.919 --> 46:31.521
So... What happened?

46:32.322 --> 46:33.956
Uh, with what?

46:35.225 --> 46:36.392
With Eden?

46:36.860 --> 46:39.195
Right. Well, um...

46:40.631 --> 46:41.631
She's dead.

46:45.035 --> 46:47.003
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

46:49.606 --> 46:51.741
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

46:51.743 --> 46:54.143
It's okay. I kind of don't
wanna talk about it,
if that's okay.

46:54.145 --> 46:55.278
Yeah.

46:56.747 --> 46:58.181
I... Yeah.

46:59.449 --> 47:00.616
Right.

47:06.356 --> 47:08.057
Sandwiches?

47:18.268 --> 47:20.236
Wow!

47:20.238 --> 47:21.904
I don't wanna creep
you out or anything,

47:21.906 --> 47:24.173
but I saw that whole
show in there,

47:24.175 --> 47:25.975
and ouch!

47:25.977 --> 47:27.677
Whoo! Eden?

47:27.679 --> 47:30.313
I mean, let's be honest.
She sounds like a bombshell.

47:30.315 --> 47:31.681
You know what I mean?
No, no.

47:31.683 --> 47:32.882
She sounds like a stripper.

47:32.884 --> 47:35.384
Oh, no. She sounds like
an angel stripper

47:35.386 --> 47:38.120
with wings,
who only strips for you.

47:38.122 --> 47:41.057
I bet she's got a real
nice rack, too.

47:41.059 --> 47:43.559
Huh? Big, but not too big.

47:43.561 --> 47:45.428
Nice and manageable.

47:45.430 --> 47:48.130
And she's dead! Oh!

47:48.132 --> 47:51.567
I mean, how do you compete
with a dead angel stripper?

47:51.569 --> 47:55.104
Okay. Well, I'm thinking,
you just go back in there

47:55.106 --> 47:57.907
and sink this ship
before he does.

47:57.909 --> 47:58.975
Yeah.

47:58.977 --> 48:00.309
'Cause I mean, let's be real.

48:00.311 --> 48:02.078
How long do you think he's
gonna dig this whole

48:02.080 --> 48:05.414
quirky barista with
body issues thing?

48:05.416 --> 48:07.350
Oh. Oh, and Beck?

48:09.319 --> 48:11.387
You got a little something
on your face.

48:23.734 --> 48:25.401
Oh, come on.

48:25.403 --> 48:28.471
You're really gonna make me
eat both of these sandwiches
myself?

48:29.439 --> 48:30.539
Because I will.

48:32.609 --> 48:33.709
Nothing?

48:36.179 --> 48:37.346
Okay.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.082
Whatever.

48:41.318 --> 48:42.385
Mm.

49:52.689 --> 49:54.390
♪

50:11.241 --> 50:13.442
Oh. Somebody slept in
this morning.

50:13.710 --> 50:15.277
Hmm.

50:15.279 --> 50:16.645
You've been up
for a while?

50:16.647 --> 50:18.047
Yeah, you were snoring.

50:18.049 --> 50:20.316
- Oh. Of course.
- So...

50:21.385 --> 50:22.518
Pop tart?

50:22.520 --> 50:24.387
Uh... pass.

50:25.255 --> 50:26.589
So, check this out.

50:26.591 --> 50:28.424
I was looking for
a pen this morning...

50:28.426 --> 50:31.160
So I went looking
through the drawers,

50:31.162 --> 50:33.729
and I found a whole box
of bendy straws.

50:34.031 --> 50:35.264
Mm-hmm.

50:35.266 --> 50:36.465
So I was like,
"Okay, now I'm curious."

50:36.467 --> 50:37.867
So I go through
some of the cabinets,

50:37.869 --> 50:39.368
I fond two more boxes.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.337
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- So then I'm...

50:42.340 --> 50:45.441
Are you even paying attention,
or are you just doing that...

50:45.443 --> 50:47.009
fucking "mm-hmm" thing
you do?

50:47.011 --> 50:47.977
Like you're pretending
to care?

50:47.979 --> 50:49.612
Oh, good. You're being a dick.

50:49.614 --> 50:53.649
No, I heard your story.
Bendy straws. Very funny.

50:56.353 --> 50:59.588
Is this your whole
day today, or...

50:59.590 --> 51:00.990
I'm working.

51:00.992 --> 51:02.825
Okay.

51:02.827 --> 51:04.794
I guess I'll just...

51:04.796 --> 51:08.297
Mm. If you were gonna do it,
you would have done it, right?

51:08.299 --> 51:09.965
I'm still working on
that guy.

51:09.967 --> 51:11.500
Ooh, it's probably
time to clean up.

51:32.889 --> 51:34.557
Mm. Oh!

51:40.263 --> 51:41.797
Who's that?

51:42.766 --> 51:43.933
Who's what?

51:44.868 --> 51:45.968
Who texted you?

51:46.970 --> 51:48.904
- No one.
- No one?

51:49.539 --> 51:50.573
Huh.

51:52.008 --> 51:53.342
Well, who's Chippy?

51:54.244 --> 51:56.445
Mm. Looking through my phone.

51:56.447 --> 51:58.681
No, I wasn't looking
through your phone.

51:58.683 --> 52:00.449
Well, browsing around...

52:00.451 --> 52:02.118
Well, I thought it was
my phone, so, you know, I...

52:02.120 --> 52:05.921
Oh. You thought that
this was your phone?

52:05.923 --> 52:09.325
This, with the...
And then the...

52:09.826 --> 52:11.060
Okay, all right.

52:11.062 --> 52:12.495
- Okay.
- Okay.

52:13.730 --> 52:15.064
Okay, um...

52:15.066 --> 52:16.432
I'm gonna go on a run.

52:16.434 --> 52:18.868
Can you run
the dishwasher for me?
I loaded it.

52:18.870 --> 52:20.503
If you loaded it,
why don't you just run it?

52:20.505 --> 52:23.606
'Cause, Liam, I'm not doing
everything around here.

52:23.608 --> 52:25.040
Okay?

52:25.042 --> 52:26.442
Why are you taking
your phone with you?

52:26.444 --> 52:28.210
Do you want me to go
on the run with you?

52:28.212 --> 52:29.612
Yeah. You know what?

52:29.614 --> 52:31.547
Yeah. I'm gonna go on
the run with you.

52:31.549 --> 52:32.414
Okay.

52:32.416 --> 52:34.250
Did you even bring
running shoes?

52:34.252 --> 52:35.684
Do you not want me to
go with you?

52:35.686 --> 52:38.320
I don't care.
Yes, come on the run.

52:38.322 --> 52:39.955
I'm not gonna come if you
don't want me to come.

52:39.957 --> 52:41.023
Because then it becomes
like I...

52:41.025 --> 52:42.158
You know what?
I'm just gonna go then.

52:42.160 --> 52:43.192
- Just gonna go.
- Okay.

52:43.194 --> 52:44.260
All right. Just be safe.

52:44.262 --> 52:45.528
- Don't talk to strangers.
- Mm-hmm.

52:45.530 --> 52:47.196
Look both ways
before you cross, okay?

52:47.198 --> 52:48.197
Thank you, Dad.

52:48.199 --> 52:49.498
I love you. I...

52:51.468 --> 52:52.468
Huh.

52:53.303 --> 52:54.837
Love you. Shouldn't...

53:04.080 --> 53:05.614
I love you.

53:09.786 --> 53:10.920
I can run.

53:12.222 --> 53:13.789
I can do runs.

53:13.791 --> 53:14.957
I think I could do it.

53:14.959 --> 53:16.292
I love you.

53:17.260 --> 53:18.427
I love you, too.

53:18.429 --> 53:20.029
Ha-ha. It's like...

53:45.755 --> 53:46.789
Huh.

53:48.692 --> 53:49.692
Whoo!

54:00.670 --> 54:01.870
Liam?

54:02.772 --> 54:04.106
Liam, is that you?

54:04.108 --> 54:05.474
Oh, hey.

54:08.645 --> 54:09.878
What the...

54:12.749 --> 54:14.416
Oh, my God.

54:14.418 --> 54:16.852
What are you doing here?

54:16.854 --> 54:18.754
Well, you didn't say
"I love you" back.

54:20.056 --> 54:21.190
What?

54:21.192 --> 54:22.725
You didn't say
"I love you."

54:23.293 --> 54:25.194
- Oh.
- When you left.

54:25.196 --> 54:26.729
- So...
- Okay.

54:26.731 --> 54:29.131
Uh... I guess
I didn't hear you.

54:29.966 --> 54:32.601
Oh. Right.
Yeah, okay.

54:34.204 --> 54:35.704
But do you?

54:35.706 --> 54:37.306
Of course I do.

54:37.308 --> 54:39.541
I just kind of wanna
hear you say it, though.

54:39.543 --> 54:40.543
Okay.

54:41.011 --> 54:42.144
I love you.

54:44.782 --> 54:46.015
Cool.

54:46.017 --> 54:47.516
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

54:53.490 --> 54:55.090
- I'll see you.
- See you.

55:26.657 --> 55:28.957
- Is that the doorbell?
- Yes, I'll get it.

55:28.959 --> 55:30.059
It's probably my mom.

55:30.694 --> 55:31.727
What?

55:31.729 --> 55:33.662
What would your mom
be doing here?

55:34.164 --> 55:35.831
Uh, I invited her.

55:36.599 --> 55:38.534
Why the hell would
you do that?

55:38.536 --> 55:40.202
She wanted to come
and meet you.

55:41.004 --> 55:42.438
Oh. Okay.

55:42.440 --> 55:44.106
Well, now is not
the best time.

55:44.108 --> 55:45.374
I mean, I'm in the shower,

55:45.376 --> 55:47.242
and you were supposed to,
like, get ready

55:47.244 --> 55:48.911
and go do something
together.

55:48.913 --> 55:50.312
Okay. So what am I
supposed to do?

55:50.314 --> 55:51.547
Tell her not to come inside?

55:51.549 --> 55:52.781
Get back into her car

55:52.783 --> 55:54.623
and drive all the way home
without meeting you?

55:55.151 --> 55:56.618
I mean, yeah.

56:07.697 --> 56:08.630
Mommy!

56:08.632 --> 56:10.065
My sweet boy!

56:10.067 --> 56:11.166
How are you?

56:11.168 --> 56:13.202
You look tired.
Are you sleeping enough?

56:13.204 --> 56:14.703
Yes, I'm sleeping enough.

56:14.705 --> 56:18.006
Okay. Here, I brought you
some clean undies.

56:18.008 --> 56:20.042
Oh, okay.
Thanks, Mommy.

56:20.044 --> 56:23.011
You know, Liam, I was
googling this place
on the computer,

56:23.013 --> 56:26.448
and I read that there are
spiders and scorpions
everywhere.

56:26.450 --> 56:29.218
And if they get you,
your skin falls off.

56:29.220 --> 56:30.719
There were pictures...

56:30.721 --> 56:32.888
Yeah. No, I haven't seen any.

56:32.890 --> 56:36.024
So, are you going to
invite your mother inside?

56:36.026 --> 56:38.660
Or do you want her to bake
out here in the sun?

56:38.662 --> 56:40.796
Well, actually, Mommy, um...

56:40.798 --> 56:42.498
Beck's in the shower
right now.

56:42.500 --> 56:43.799
Oh, she's in the shower.

56:43.801 --> 56:47.469
Liam!
Is she naked in there?

56:47.471 --> 56:49.104
Actually, no.
Probably not.

56:49.106 --> 56:50.939
Oh, thank God.

56:50.941 --> 56:54.476
Well, we'll just
put the kettle on and
wait for her to finish up.

56:54.478 --> 56:57.880
Actually, Mommy,
the thing is...

56:57.882 --> 57:00.249
Beck isn't really
feeling well right now.
So...

57:00.251 --> 57:01.417
Liam, she's sick?

57:01.419 --> 57:04.052
She could
be contagious.

57:04.054 --> 57:05.320
No, I don't think so.

57:05.322 --> 57:07.055
Oh, no?

57:07.057 --> 57:09.725
Well, you know who else
didn't think I knew
what I was talking about?

57:09.727 --> 57:12.895
Yes, I know, Mommy.
I know.

57:12.897 --> 57:15.564
I'm just gonna stay here, okay,
and take care of her.

57:15.566 --> 57:17.399
But I'll make sure I take
plenty of vitamins.

57:17.401 --> 57:20.402
Oh, you are such
a sweet prince.

57:20.404 --> 57:23.705
How did you get to
be so sweet?

57:23.707 --> 57:24.606
Oh...

57:24.608 --> 57:26.341
My sweet mommy, probably.

57:26.343 --> 57:29.244
I love you my sweet
little peanut boy.

57:29.246 --> 57:30.345
Okay, I love you, too.

57:30.347 --> 57:31.613
- Okay, sweetie.
- Okay.

57:31.615 --> 57:33.649
- Mommy loves you.
- I love you.

57:33.651 --> 57:35.350
- Sweetheart.
- Okay.

57:35.352 --> 57:37.052
- I love you.
- Bye, Bye.

57:37.054 --> 57:38.520
I love you. Bye bye.

57:50.700 --> 57:52.968
Okay, let's hear it.

57:54.070 --> 57:54.937
Hear what?

57:54.939 --> 57:56.538
What do you have
against my mother?

57:56.540 --> 57:58.507
What? I don't even
know your mother.

57:58.509 --> 58:00.342
And whose fault is that?

58:00.344 --> 58:02.945
Okay. I just think it's
a little bit weird

58:02.947 --> 58:04.480
that you'd invite her
here today.

58:04.482 --> 58:07.349
- What?
- I mean, I thought we were
gonna, I don't know...

58:07.351 --> 58:09.218
hang out together
like we used to.

58:09.220 --> 58:12.888
Not just sit around all day
while you play
your stupid Nintendo

58:12.890 --> 58:14.289
and hang out with
your mom.

58:14.291 --> 58:16.158
Okay, first off,
you know damn well
that is not a Nintendo.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.193
Okay? And secondly,
I'm a little offended
that you...

58:18.195 --> 58:20.095
I'm sorry, I can't understand
what you're saying right now,

58:20.097 --> 58:23.031
because you're gnawing off
your fingers like
a fucking psychopath.

58:23.033 --> 58:24.600
You said you thought
that was cool.

58:24.602 --> 58:27.669
Okay. I used to think
jean shorts were cool.

58:27.671 --> 58:29.738
Real nice, Beck.
Real nice.

58:29.740 --> 58:31.740
Can you help me
take this thing off?

58:31.742 --> 58:33.075
Why do you wanna
take it off?

58:33.077 --> 58:36.245
Because it's itchy,
and it's way too tight,
and...

58:36.247 --> 58:37.946
I just need
to take it off.

58:38.982 --> 58:40.015
Well, you can't.

58:40.950 --> 58:42.050
What?

58:42.752 --> 58:43.785
Why not?

58:44.420 --> 58:46.088
Oh, my God!

58:46.090 --> 58:48.156
Oh, my God, Liam.
What is this thing?

58:48.158 --> 58:50.192
It's a tracking device.
What did you think it was?

58:50.928 --> 58:53.996
Yeah. How else am I
supposed to know where
you are at all times?

58:54.664 --> 58:56.732
Liam, that is insane!

58:56.734 --> 58:58.734
That's, like, beyond insane.

58:58.736 --> 59:00.502
Wait, hold on.
Don't... Okay.

59:00.504 --> 59:01.803
I need to know you're
safe at all times.

59:01.805 --> 59:03.805
Ow! You just made it tighter!

59:03.807 --> 59:06.408
Beck, I'm sorry, okay?
But I can't lose you too.

59:09.812 --> 59:12.648
Oh! What the fuck
is that?

59:12.650 --> 59:15.918
Nice performance there,
douchebag.

59:15.920 --> 59:17.986
Relax. He's just
a friend of mine.

59:17.988 --> 59:20.656
That's right.
Relax, Liam.

59:20.658 --> 59:22.958
Relax, man!

59:22.960 --> 59:25.627
Let me get up to speed here.
So, uh...

59:25.629 --> 59:26.828
For some reason,

59:26.830 --> 59:29.464
Mr. Clingy with the dead
stripper girlfriend here

59:29.466 --> 59:32.267
is totally hooked on
the Beck sauce. Ow!

59:32.269 --> 59:34.770
And he's upset because you
don't wanna meet his mommy

59:34.772 --> 59:36.271
and wear a tracking
bracelet, right?

59:36.273 --> 59:37.339
Am I right?

59:37.341 --> 59:39.141
Yeah. Well, honestly,

59:39.143 --> 59:41.944
I'm surprised the guy's
so jazzed up on you,
considering all your weird,

59:41.946 --> 59:43.679
albeit justified body issues.

59:43.681 --> 59:46.248
Okay, I'm sorry.
Who is this
mean little monster?

59:46.250 --> 59:49.217
You know, I got your mean
little monster right here.

59:49.219 --> 59:50.319
Oh, gross, man.

59:50.321 --> 59:51.653
Come on!

59:51.655 --> 59:53.522
Just cut it out, guys.

59:53.524 --> 59:57.025
Beck, can I please
see you in the fort?

59:58.361 --> 59:59.795
Alone?

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:11.940
Oh, well, hello.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:13.775
Hey, Liam.
What the hell's going on?

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:15.410
Beck, I think this will
be really good for us.

01:00:15.412 --> 01:00:16.812
Thank you, Liam.

01:00:16.814 --> 01:00:20.382
Beck, Liam wishes to
unburden himself
of his feelings.

01:00:20.384 --> 01:00:21.350
Oh, he does?

01:00:21.352 --> 01:00:23.785
This is a safe space.

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:26.355
Why don't you sit down?

01:00:26.357 --> 01:00:29.992
I'm sure there's
a thing or two
you'd like to say

01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:31.393
as well?

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:34.529
I'll sit down.

01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:36.164
Liam, you, too.

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:44.006
What's on your mind, Liam?

01:00:44.008 --> 01:00:46.274
Well, first,
Dr. Lipschweiss,

01:00:46.276 --> 01:00:48.610
let me just say thank you
so much for taking time

01:00:48.612 --> 01:00:50.579
out of your very busy schedule
to meet with us.

01:00:50.581 --> 01:00:52.914
We really appreciate it.

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:55.951
I recently had
the displeasure

01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:58.320
of meeting one of
Beck's friends.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:01.523
And I have to say that
I am a little uncomfortable

01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:03.158
with the nature of
their relationship.

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:07.029
We're doing this?

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:09.665
Okay, we're doing this.

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:11.500
Hi, Dr. Lipschweiss.

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:12.668
Hi.

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:14.403
I think Liam needs
to calm down.

01:01:14.405 --> 01:01:16.304
Chippy is just a friend.

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:19.441
And Liam here is acting
like a crazy person.

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:21.076
Chippy?

01:01:21.078 --> 01:01:22.577
That's the guy that
texted you earlier?

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:25.847
Why is this guy texting you
and then showing up uninvited?

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:27.582
Dr. Lipschweiss, why is
this guy texting her

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:28.984
and then showing up uninvited?

01:01:28.986 --> 01:01:31.153
Because, Liam, he's one of
my oldest friends in the world.

01:01:31.155 --> 01:01:33.188
That's just his thing.
It's what he does.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.756
He's your oldest
friend in the world?

01:01:34.758 --> 01:01:37.292
Is this the same friend
that got you all fucked up
in college?

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:38.294
Liam!

01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:39.928
Language!

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:43.699
This is a safe space.

01:01:43.701 --> 01:01:46.068
Sorry, Dr. Lipschweiss.

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.537
Look, I was in
a dark place back then.

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:49.771
Okay?

01:01:49.773 --> 01:01:53.008
I am just as much to blame
for that as Chippy.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.210
He may seem
a little bit, you know,

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:57.179
rough around the edges,
but honestly,

01:01:57.181 --> 01:01:59.347
at least he tells me
the truth.

01:01:59.349 --> 01:02:00.348
Okay.

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:02.384
Well, I don't want you
seeing him anymore.

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:04.786
Excuse me?

01:02:04.788 --> 01:02:06.088
You heard me.

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:08.390
You can't tell me
who I can
be friends with.

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:11.960
Really? 'Cause I'm
pretty sure I just did.

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:15.997
Wow. So this is
one of those, like,
"It's him or me" things?

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:17.165
Yeah.

01:02:17.167 --> 01:02:20.068
I feel like the choice
should be pretty obvious.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.603
I mean, that guy is
an asshole.

01:02:21.605 --> 01:02:23.638
And he's the reason
you messed up your
whole fucking life.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:24.873
Liam!

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:29.211
Safe space.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.480
Sorry, again.

01:02:31.482 --> 01:02:33.315
Wow.

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:35.450
Oh. Okay.

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:38.253
Sorry, didn't know you guys
were mid-sess.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:42.224
Man, it looks like you're
really working through
some things here.

01:02:42.226 --> 01:02:43.658
So?

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:44.826
I'm gonna go on a beer run.

01:02:44.828 --> 01:02:46.261
Beck, I know what you like.

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:49.531
Liam, I'll see if they make
wine coolers for you, sport.

01:02:49.533 --> 01:02:51.833
Cool, cool, cool.
Thanks, man.
I appreciate that.

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:54.136
Yeah? How about you, toots?

01:02:54.138 --> 01:02:56.938
No, thank you, um...
sweetheart.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.774
Well, okay.

01:03:09.886 --> 01:03:11.920
You know what I think?

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:14.122
I think our time is up.

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:18.927
I think we made some
good progress here today.

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:21.329
I have a proposal to make you.

01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:22.898
Okay, sure.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.099
You trust me?

01:03:24.101 --> 01:03:26.434
Yes, Dr. Lipschweiss,
we trust you.

01:03:26.436 --> 01:03:27.502
We'll try anything.

01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:28.637
Well, that's good.

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:31.907
Liam, I think you
should move out.

01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:33.074
- What?
- Sounds good.

01:03:33.076 --> 01:03:35.310
Some time apart
will be good for you both.

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:37.612
Mm-hmm. Agreed.

01:03:37.614 --> 01:03:38.914
Okay. Well, guess that's it.

01:03:39.917 --> 01:03:41.883
You heard her.
That settles it.

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:43.885
Thank you, Dr...

01:03:43.887 --> 01:03:45.554
The session is not over.

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:51.493
Liam, I'll send you
an invoice.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.630
Now this session
is over.

01:03:58.234 --> 01:03:59.234
Uh...

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:30.498
♪

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:53.622
Fuck!

01:05:02.866 --> 01:05:05.200
Oh, fuck me, man.

01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:08.169
Fuck me!

01:05:10.173 --> 01:05:12.474
Huh? What's up, skank?

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:14.542
Didn't go well with
the old lady, huh?

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:16.211
Tough break, <i>chico.</i>

01:05:16.213 --> 01:05:17.213
Catch.

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:21.116
I'll put in a good word
for you. Ha!

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:24.686
Yo, what up, baby?

01:05:24.688 --> 01:05:27.589
Oh, girl, you look...

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:29.457
moderately okay this morning.

01:05:29.859 --> 01:05:31.059
Dick.

01:05:37.733 --> 01:05:39.901
Ah! Goddamn, it's good.

01:05:39.903 --> 01:05:41.569
Fuck, that's good!

01:05:57.386 --> 01:05:58.386
Hey.

01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:00.188
Oh, hey.

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:07.696
- I...
- I, uh...

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:10.799
Um...

01:06:11.834 --> 01:06:12.867
You go.

01:06:12.869 --> 01:06:15.470
I wasn't expecting
to see you.

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:17.973
Right. I was just
in the area...

01:06:17.975 --> 01:06:19.407
on my way
to the kitchen.

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:20.508
- Cool.
- So...

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.344
- Cool.
- Um...

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:26.114
You look really busy.

01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:28.249
Oh. You know what?
I needed to take
a break anyway.

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:31.686
- Do you wanna sit?
- Uh...

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:33.555
I probably shouldn't.

01:06:33.557 --> 01:06:35.523
I don't know if that's
the best idea.

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:36.958
Right. No...

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.493
- You're right.
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:42.097
- But, um...
- Um...

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:46.434
So...

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:49.637
- How are you?
- I... I'm good.

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:51.072
I'm really good.

01:06:51.074 --> 01:06:52.941
- I'm good.
- Great.

01:06:52.943 --> 01:06:55.744
- And you?
- Good. Yeah. Oh, so good.

01:06:55.746 --> 01:06:57.112
- Really good.
- Cool.

01:06:57.114 --> 01:06:59.347
- Mm-hmm.
- That's good to hear.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:00.815
Yeah.

01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:02.650
You look really nice.

01:07:02.652 --> 01:07:04.552
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:05.787
I stopped eating.

01:07:07.923 --> 01:07:09.924
- You look nice, too.
- Oh, thanks.

01:07:09.926 --> 01:07:11.526
Yeah, I started wearing
pants again.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.194
I could tell.

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.296
And you changed your hair?

01:07:15.298 --> 01:07:16.865
Uh...

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:18.900
I think I just
took my hat off, but...

01:07:18.902 --> 01:07:19.868
it's nice you noticed.

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:21.569
- It looks great.
- Thanks.

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:25.040
- So you're still with...
- Oh, yeah.

01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:27.475
Yeah, got the old
nine to five.

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:29.711
- Cool. And it's...
- Oh, it's great.

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:32.247
- It's great?
- Yeah, better than ever,
actually.

01:07:32.249 --> 01:07:33.548
Oh.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.917
Yeah. I've got over
2,000 subscribers
to my stream now.

01:07:35.919 --> 01:07:38.353
Liam, that's incredible.

01:07:38.355 --> 01:07:40.055
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:07:40.057 --> 01:07:42.457
- Really proud of you.
- Yeah. I'm, uh...

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:45.193
I'm really happy.

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.129
What? What is it?

01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:49.864
No, I just...

01:07:49.866 --> 01:07:51.800
I'm grateful for
all of my success.

01:07:51.802 --> 01:07:52.967
Don't get me wrong, but...

01:07:52.969 --> 01:07:55.437
What is it if I can't
share it with you?

01:07:55.439 --> 01:07:58.373
Liam, no, this is not
a good time.

01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:00.041
Please don't do this
right now.

01:08:00.043 --> 01:08:03.378
Beck, since we've been apart,
I've had some time to think,
and...

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.346
I think we should
give it another chance.

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:07.749
I don't know, Liam.

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.585
I don't know.

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:19.661
Beck, let's go.

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:20.895
Oh, God.

01:08:20.897 --> 01:08:21.830
I have to go.

01:08:21.832 --> 01:08:23.031
No, stay, stay.

01:08:23.033 --> 01:08:24.432
I can't.

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:26.468
Liam, I...

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:28.636
I think Dr. Lipschweiss
was right.

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:31.238
I think that we need
some time apart.

01:08:32.741 --> 01:08:33.908
I'm sorry.

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:36.010
Yeah.

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:37.545
I'm sorry, too.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:40.348
Seriously,
let's fucking go!

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:49.390
Yeah.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:08.309
Hey, thanks for, um,
cleaning the place up.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.478
It means a lot to me.

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:13.948
I didn't wanna get charged
extra cleaning fee.

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:17.986
That's so sweet.

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:31.666
Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.269
Those are both for me,
obviously!

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:35.870
You think you can
afford to eat that?

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:37.639
Huh, cankles?
Why don't you feed yourself

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.474
some ice cubes
if you're hungry, huh?

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:41.176
You're packing on, mate.

01:09:41.178 --> 01:09:43.912
What are you crying about,
huh, saddlebags?

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:45.846
Huh? Fatty? Huh?

01:09:54.423 --> 01:09:56.191
Okay, I can't take
any more of this.

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:57.458
Liam, what are you
doing here?

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.427
Whoa! Look whose
balls dropped!

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:00.762
Oh, fuck you, Chippy.

01:10:00.764 --> 01:10:03.064
- Fuck me? Fuck you.
- Fuck you, man.

01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:04.866
- Guys, just stop it.
- Oh, shut up, Beck.

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:07.635
Okay, this guy is
a miserable fucking asshole.

01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:10.772
What he wants is for
you two to be miserable
fucking assholes together.

01:10:10.774 --> 01:10:12.807
Liam, you're wrong.
Chippy is my friend.

01:10:12.809 --> 01:10:15.610
Yeah, Liam, I'm her friend,
and who the fuck are you?

01:10:15.612 --> 01:10:16.878
I love her.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.214
Okay? I actually
care about her.

01:10:19.216 --> 01:10:21.282
Oh, please!

01:10:21.284 --> 01:10:23.585
You know how this is
gonna go, don't you, Beck?

01:10:23.587 --> 01:10:25.620
Huh? He's gonna
wear you down,

01:10:25.622 --> 01:10:28.156
and smother you until
you eventually give in.

01:10:28.158 --> 01:10:31.059
And as soon as you do,
he'll get bored.

01:10:31.061 --> 01:10:33.361
He'll leave you all alone,
just like your mother.

01:10:33.363 --> 01:10:35.096
Hey, that is not true.

01:10:35.098 --> 01:10:36.864
That is not true, Beck, okay?

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:37.899
Look...

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:40.535
I love you.

01:10:40.537 --> 01:10:43.037
Oh, cut it out!

01:10:43.039 --> 01:10:44.839
You don't love her, man.

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:47.175
You just settled for her,
'cause you lost your ex.

01:10:47.177 --> 01:10:48.576
Now you're smothering
the shit out her.

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.945
You're probably gonna lose
your consolation prize too.

01:10:50.947 --> 01:10:55.383
How am I ever gonna compete
with your dead ex-girlfriend?

01:10:57.119 --> 01:10:59.120
Well, Beck, um...

01:10:59.122 --> 01:11:01.222
I mean, you called me "Eden".

01:11:01.224 --> 01:11:03.825
You said,
"I love you, too, Eden."

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:06.728
How do you think
that made me feel?

01:11:07.496 --> 01:11:09.030
You obviously still
love her.

01:11:09.032 --> 01:11:12.500
And smothering me
in this fake love isn't
gonna bring her back.

01:11:13.302 --> 01:11:14.502
Right. Yeah, um...

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:20.708
When I said she was dead...

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:23.544
Yeah?

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:27.682
Well, you know how, like,
people say things sometimes

01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:29.617
that in the moment,
they kind of

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:31.419
- get all...
- Oh, my God.

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:36.391
Liam, is Eden not dead?

01:11:37.092 --> 01:11:40.762
Ooh! Fuck me!

01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:42.563
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.

01:11:42.565 --> 01:11:43.765
Beck, let me explain.

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:46.301
Oh, what a twist.
I did not see this coming.

01:11:46.303 --> 01:11:47.335
I meant figuratively.

01:11:47.337 --> 01:11:48.703
You know?
Like, she's dead to me.

01:11:48.705 --> 01:11:51.439
Like, I'm so over her,
she might as well be dead.

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:52.674
Liam, that's sick.

01:11:52.676 --> 01:11:54.509
That's what a fucking
sick person does.

01:11:54.511 --> 01:11:56.144
Oh, my God.

01:11:56.146 --> 01:11:57.512
- Beck, please.
- No.

01:11:57.514 --> 01:11:59.747
Okay, I love you.
I wouldn't say anything
to hurt you.

01:11:59.749 --> 01:12:01.916
No. I don't even know
who you are right now.

01:12:01.918 --> 01:12:05.420
Oh, my God! This is
one of the greatest things
I've ever seen.

01:12:05.422 --> 01:12:07.622
Shut the fuck up, Chippy!

01:12:22.037 --> 01:12:23.037
Oh, God!

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:26.474
- Chippy, don't!
- Move, bitch.

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:28.576
Ow!

01:12:29.912 --> 01:12:31.145
Chippy, don't!

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:44.125
All right, stop it.
The both of you,
just stop!

01:12:44.127 --> 01:12:45.893
Shut up,
you little dick.

01:12:45.895 --> 01:12:47.195
No, that is it.

01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:48.463
I am done!

01:12:48.465 --> 01:12:50.998
Beck, please.
Okay? I love you.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.201
All right?
I need you.

01:12:53.203 --> 01:12:54.435
You're perfect.

01:12:54.437 --> 01:12:57.004
You're not perfect
by a long shot.

01:12:57.773 --> 01:12:59.774
You need me.
I won't lie to you.

01:12:59.776 --> 01:13:01.509
Don't fucking talk
to her like that, man.

01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:03.177
Ah, she needs to hear it.

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:04.679
That's it.
I am done.

01:13:04.681 --> 01:13:07.115
Okay? I don't need
either one of you.

01:13:07.117 --> 01:13:08.483
- Beck.
- Beck...

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:11.119
I don't need you, Liam.

01:13:12.187 --> 01:13:14.622
And I don't need you,
Chippy.

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:18.493
What?

01:13:18.827 --> 01:13:20.228
No!

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:25.032
Chippy?

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:29.604
Chippy!

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:31.005
What's going on?

01:13:33.876 --> 01:13:35.176
Chippy!

01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:39.380
You said that...

01:13:39.382 --> 01:13:41.449
You said the words.

01:13:41.451 --> 01:13:42.984
What? What words?

01:13:44.386 --> 01:13:48.923
"I don't need you, Chippy."

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:52.393
Oh, Chippy, I take them back.
I take them back.

01:13:53.663 --> 01:13:55.997
Oh, Chippy, no!

01:14:03.472 --> 01:14:04.872
Your breath...

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.542
is terrible.

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:17.885
Chippy...

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:22.156
- My Chippy.
- It's okay.

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:27.195
You're better off
without him.

01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:31.732
You don't need him.

01:14:31.734 --> 01:14:33.701
Okay? It'll just
be us now.

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:39.640
No.

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:50.218
No, it's over.

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.252
Beck...

01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:54.288
Uh-huh. It has to be.

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:56.791
Because of that guy?

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.840
Cut it off, Liam.

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:14.709
Beck...

01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:19.647
Cut... it... off.

01:15:20.048 --> 01:15:21.115
Now.

01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:16.203
Oh, Chippy.

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:25.379
My Chippy boy!

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:39.327
I love you, Chippy.

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:26.173
<i>♪ </i>

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:46.794
Hey, buddy.

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:48.362
Hey, man.

01:17:48.364 --> 01:17:51.165
Ooh. I like what you've
done with the place.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:54.468
I figured it was time
I started living
like an adult.

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:56.904
Yeah. Officially move into
your friend's guesthouse

01:17:56.906 --> 01:17:59.073
after just squatting there
for free for two years.

01:17:59.075 --> 01:18:00.241
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:18:00.243 --> 01:18:01.842
Come a long way, huh?

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.014
Aw, Lili...

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:09.550
You guys, I'm gonna
die alone.

01:18:09.552 --> 01:18:10.751
No, you're not.

01:18:10.753 --> 01:18:12.186
- You've got us.
- I'm serious.

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:15.189
I really liked this girl.
Like, a lot.

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:16.257
And I fucked it up.

01:18:16.259 --> 01:18:18.292
But it's Eden, you know.
She got in my head.

01:18:18.294 --> 01:18:19.226
She made me crazy.

01:18:19.228 --> 01:18:21.162
No, man.
You gotta stop it with that.

01:18:21.164 --> 01:18:22.129
What?

01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:23.597
You didn't become this
because of her.

01:18:23.599 --> 01:18:25.032
You were always this way.

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:27.001
- Buddy...
- No, Sara.
We can't keep doing this.

01:18:27.003 --> 01:18:29.437
Look, Liam, this is
an important moment
in your life.

01:18:29.439 --> 01:18:31.539
And I'm really sorry, but,

01:18:31.541 --> 01:18:32.873
I love you, man, and

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:34.175
I'm gonna have to get
real with you right now.

01:18:34.177 --> 01:18:36.310
- Okay?
- Are you...
Are you gonna hit me?

01:18:36.312 --> 01:18:38.846
What? No, I'm not gonna...

01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:45.920
You didn't <i>lose</i> Eden.

01:18:45.922 --> 01:18:47.455
You sort of
pushed her away

01:18:47.457 --> 01:18:49.724
by acting like a psycho
all the time.

01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:51.092
- What?
- I'm serious.

01:18:51.094 --> 01:18:53.627
Like, you remember the time
you hid in her trunk

01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:55.096
when she was just trying
to go to the dentist?

01:18:55.098 --> 01:18:57.364
Yeah. Well, sure. I wanted to
make sure she got there safe.

01:18:57.366 --> 01:18:59.266
Do you remember that other
time you ran down the street

01:18:59.268 --> 01:19:00.968
chasing her because
she went on a run

01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:02.203
and she forgot to say,
"I love you too"?

01:19:02.205 --> 01:19:03.671
"Chase" is like
an aggressive word.

01:19:03.673 --> 01:19:06.073
I feel like it's more like
I followed her at a distance.

01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:08.175
No, still... Bad.
Sounds bad.

01:19:08.177 --> 01:19:10.611
It's not your fault that
Eden cheated on you.

01:19:10.613 --> 01:19:14.615
But she did try to break up
with you like a good
half a dozen times, man,

01:19:14.617 --> 01:19:16.484
and you just didn't
let her.

01:19:16.486 --> 01:19:18.986
You know, and I don't condone
what she did, but,

01:19:18.988 --> 01:19:22.156
you made it tough for her
to be your girlfriend.

01:19:22.158 --> 01:19:25.359
Yeah, you were kind of
a stalker type.

01:19:25.361 --> 01:19:29.130
Actually, you are.
'Cause you stalk me sometimes.

01:19:30.665 --> 01:19:32.233
Not like in a sexual way.

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:35.402
Okay, look...

01:19:35.404 --> 01:19:38.806
When you love something, Liam,
you tend to Lenny it.

01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:39.774
I "Lenny it"?

01:19:39.776 --> 01:19:41.142
You know, it's like...

01:19:41.144 --> 01:19:43.644
"I like petting
soft things, George."

01:19:43.646 --> 01:19:45.112
"Oh, Go... Oh, God!"

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:47.481
Jesus, Buddy!

01:19:47.983 --> 01:19:49.450
Too far.

01:19:49.452 --> 01:19:50.985
Okay, so...

01:19:50.987 --> 01:19:53.687
If it's not Eden,
then why am I like this?

01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:54.622
- Your mom.
- It's your mom.

01:19:54.624 --> 01:19:56.023
My mom.
Yeah, that makes sense.

01:19:56.025 --> 01:19:58.893
I should have
put that together.

01:19:58.895 --> 01:20:01.195
I'm sorry that I had
to say all that stuff.

01:20:01.197 --> 01:20:03.697
But I really care about you,
and I hope that it was helpful.

01:20:03.699 --> 01:20:05.766
I... I appreciate that.

01:20:05.768 --> 01:20:07.101
I care about you
too, big guy.

01:20:07.103 --> 01:20:08.103
Thanks.

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:10.404
You're a good man.

01:20:10.406 --> 01:20:12.807
- Such a good friend.
- You make me a good man.

01:20:12.809 --> 01:20:14.508
I do? Me?

01:20:15.343 --> 01:20:16.544
Gross. All right.

01:20:17.279 --> 01:20:18.245
I'm out of here.

01:20:18.247 --> 01:20:21.315
- Where are you going?
- Out. I'm gonna...

01:20:21.783 --> 01:20:23.050
I'm gonna go out.

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:25.386
All right.

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:28.889
See you later. Keep...

01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:31.258
- Do you wanna have
sex in his bed?
- Obviously.

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.461
Oh, my God.
I wanna fuck your dragon.

01:20:34.463 --> 01:20:37.665
No, I don't like
the noodles there.

01:20:37.667 --> 01:20:39.900
No, that delivery man
scares me.

01:20:40.702 --> 01:20:42.303
Uh, no.

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:44.205
I don't want that.

01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:46.574
I don't know, Bobby,
just fucking pick something.

01:20:46.576 --> 01:20:47.942
Whatever!

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:51.345
I am so sorry...

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:53.581
that I yelled.

01:20:53.583 --> 01:20:56.050
Aw, I love you, boo.

01:20:56.052 --> 01:20:58.285
Oh, yeah.

01:20:58.287 --> 01:21:00.554
Oh. Okay. Bye, bye.

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:04.491
So you're a crazy person.

01:21:04.493 --> 01:21:06.293
Yeah, definitely.

01:21:06.295 --> 01:21:08.062
How does Bobby
put up with that?

01:21:08.064 --> 01:21:09.196
It's been seven years.

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:11.165
I let my crazy out in
such a slow trip,

01:21:11.167 --> 01:21:12.900
he didn't even know
it was happening.

01:21:12.902 --> 01:21:14.235
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:21:14.237 --> 01:21:16.036
Muah!

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:17.438
- Love you.
- Love you!

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.073
Bye.

01:21:37.826 --> 01:21:39.894
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:21:39.896 --> 01:21:41.528
Hey.

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:44.064
Hey.

01:21:44.532 --> 01:21:45.966
Hi.

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:47.701
I just, um...

01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:50.371
Yeah.

01:21:50.373 --> 01:21:52.273
I'm sorry I'm weird
and fucked up.

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:57.544
Um...

01:21:57.879 --> 01:21:58.946
Me, too.

01:21:58.948 --> 01:22:02.149
For my weird and
fucked-up-ness.

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:13.294
Uh...

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.367
Are you hungry?

01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:24.004
Starving.

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:38.452
All right.

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.087
You ready?

01:22:40.089 --> 01:22:41.622
- Cheers?
- Cheers.

01:22:42.657 --> 01:22:44.892
- Whoa. Are you kidding me?
- What?

01:22:44.894 --> 01:22:46.760
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't let you eat that.

01:22:46.762 --> 01:22:47.861
What? Why?

01:22:47.863 --> 01:22:49.029
- Look at this.
- Yeah?

01:22:49.031 --> 01:22:50.230
What do you call this?

01:22:50.232 --> 01:22:52.199
It's a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:54.168
Okay, I hate to be
the one to tell you this,

01:22:54.170 --> 01:22:57.471
but that bite right there
is going to be a disaster.

01:22:57.473 --> 01:22:59.473
All right. Fair, fair.
But I was like rushing,
you know.

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:01.775
So don't make me judge my
peanut butter and jelly
making skills.

01:23:01.777 --> 01:23:04.678
You cannot rush
a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.013
You were done, you know.

01:23:06.015 --> 01:23:08.015
I wanted to get done,
so we could be done together.

01:23:08.017 --> 01:23:09.817
Aw. That's very nice.

01:23:09.819 --> 01:23:12.252
But, no, I'm sorry.

01:23:12.254 --> 01:23:14.421
You're gonna have to
spread that shit out.

01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:16.357
- Right now?
- It's cool. I'll wait.

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:21.595
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

01:23:21.597 --> 01:23:22.896
Thank you

01:23:22.898 --> 01:23:24.531
for obliging.

01:23:24.533 --> 01:23:26.033
Thank you.

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:27.234
All right.

01:23:27.236 --> 01:23:29.103
It's kind of a mess.

01:23:29.105 --> 01:23:30.838
I'm just gonna do that.

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.307
- It's gonna be better.
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:36.143
- Good?
- That's what I'm
talking about.

01:23:36.145 --> 01:23:38.445
- Better?
- Very good.

01:23:38.447 --> 01:23:40.080
- Cheers?
- Cheers.

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:48.889
Okay, it is better.

01:23:48.891 --> 01:23:51.425
