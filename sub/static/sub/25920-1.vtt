00:12.929 --> 00:14.180
-Hi.
-How's it going?

00:14.681 --> 00:16.057
-What's going on?
-How you doing?

00:16.141 --> 00:17.475
You guys see the movie <i>It?</i>

00:18.351 --> 00:20.395
-You kinda look like him!
-Yeah.

00:20.478 --> 00:22.355
-You trying to get this way?
-Yeah.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.691
You almost didn't see me
'cause you were texting.

00:24.774 --> 00:25.817
Yeah.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.152
This new study that came out

00:27.235 --> 00:31.156
says that people are less smart when
their phone is in the same room as them.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.784
Especially less smart
if the phone's in their hand.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.287
-It's true.
-What?

00:37.537 --> 00:40.707
Yeah. Not just even having, like,
the phone, like, looking at it.

00:40.790 --> 00:45.211
Just having it in your hand or close by
makes you less intelligent.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.131
-Hold your phone face up in your hand.
-OK.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.508
I'm going to ask you a question.
We'll see how well you do.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.010
How many balloons am I holding?

00:54.846 --> 00:55.680
I don't know.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.933
Exactly. You're proving my point for me.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.727
Lock the phone,
turn it over in your hand.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.229
-OK.
-So it's a little less tempting now.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.482
-OK.
-What's the atomic weight of francium?

01:05.982 --> 01:07.275
I don't know. Do you know?

01:07.484 --> 01:08.359
Two twenty-three.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.695
So that's two questions
you answered incorrectly

01:10.779 --> 01:12.864
-because your phone's in your presence.
-But--

01:12.947 --> 01:14.657
I'm here to make you smarter. Watch this.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.495
As we remove your phone

01:18.870 --> 01:19.746
from proximity.

01:19.829 --> 01:20.789
Dude!

01:21.414 --> 01:22.415
-Now...
-Dude!

01:22.499 --> 01:24.667
Here's your third question.
What's four plus five?

01:25.001 --> 01:26.377
Four plus five?

01:26.461 --> 01:27.337
Nine.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.382
Can I get that back?

01:32.133 --> 01:33.468
I backed it up to the cloud.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.640
I backed it up.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.520
Oh, my God!

01:43.895 --> 01:45.563
Touch the button.

01:46.689 --> 01:47.649
Oh, my gosh!

01:47.732 --> 01:48.691
Touch the button.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.235
Oh, my gosh! What?

01:50.693 --> 01:51.611
Whoa!

01:51.945 --> 01:53.613
Oh... my gosh!

01:58.243 --> 02:00.745
-What are you doing with my phone?
-Oh, [bleep].

02:00.829 --> 02:02.038
What are you about to do?

02:05.166 --> 02:06.000
What?

02:06.334 --> 02:09.754
Dude, that's a 7s Plus right there.
Where the hell is my phone at?

02:10.630 --> 02:12.298
I'm syncing it to the cloud.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.967
How's it supposed to make me smarter?

02:14.050 --> 02:16.636
-Now, how do you spell--
-Dude, my phone's in the sky, flying away!

02:16.719 --> 02:18.138
I'm trying to ask you a question.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.889
How do you spell "Alf"?

02:20.223 --> 02:21.391
How do you spell what?

02:23.143 --> 02:25.562
I just... Will you get my phone?

02:25.645 --> 02:27.147
I'm syncing it with the cloud.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.858
-Hold on.
-In order to back it up.

02:30.650 --> 02:34.320
-Are you--
-I backed it up. Check it out.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.531
Tear it out of the plastic.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.825
-Hold on.
-I backed it up.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.285
How the hell... ?

02:41.411 --> 02:42.453
How did you get my... ?

02:43.454 --> 02:44.289
How did you do that?

02:44.372 --> 02:48.668
-You can rip it out if you want.
-Wait... Oh, my God!

02:50.378 --> 02:52.213
Oh, my God, this is my phone!

02:52.547 --> 02:56.968
Well, now you're kind of dumb again,
but you were so smart for a second.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.887
It was so exciting. You nailed it.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.764
-You know what you shouldn't do?
-What?

03:02.348 --> 03:04.309
Take another black person's phone
and do that.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.351
They see their phone

03:05.435 --> 03:07.020
-flying like that, man...
-I agree.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.479
<i>I'm magician Justin Willman.</i>

03:08.563 --> 03:11.691
<i>I've spent my life attempting to master</i>
<i>the art of magic.</i>

03:11.816 --> 03:14.527
<i>Now I'm using magic</i>
<i>to master the art of being human.</i>

03:16.613 --> 03:18.239
<i>-Real people...</i>
-Have a great day.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.199
<i>...real magic...</i>

03:19.574 --> 03:20.408
Whoa!

03:20.742 --> 03:21.743
<i>...no camera tricks.</i>

03:21.826 --> 03:23.786
Oh, my God!

03:23.870 --> 03:25.872
<i>This is </i>Magic for Humans.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.256
When I'm doing magic...

03:35.924 --> 03:37.800
I have complete control over everything.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.135
But off stage...

03:40.929 --> 03:42.347
I can't even control myself.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.390
Everything is like crack to me.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.850
Candy Crush, Instagram...

03:46.434 --> 03:47.268
crack.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.897
Why is it that some people are just
better at self-control than me?

03:51.773 --> 03:56.569
<i>I suspect the answer lies in how we handle</i>
<i>the dilemmas we faced as kids.</i>

03:56.653 --> 04:02.075
For example, you can have one marshmallow
now, or if you can wait ten minutes...

04:03.534 --> 04:04.619
you can have two.

04:04.702 --> 04:09.082
<i>The famous Stanford marshmallow</i>
<i>experiment tests children's self-control.</i>

04:09.791 --> 04:12.543
You have a choice. You can eat it now.
Totally cool.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.755
Or if you can wait till I get back,

04:15.838 --> 04:17.423
I'll give you a second marshmallow.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.217
I can do it.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.593
You can wait ten minutes?

04:20.677 --> 04:22.345
-Mm-hmm.
-OK.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.973
By the way, if you want,
you can use that cup to cover it up

04:25.056 --> 04:26.516
so you don't have to look at it.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.977
-Good luck.
-OK.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.647
<i>Researchers showed that by putting</i>
<i>a marshmallow in front of a kid</i>

04:32.730 --> 04:33.982
<i>and daring him not to eat it,</i>

04:34.065 --> 04:36.943
<i>you could tell if one day</i>
<i>they'd be the next Steve Jobs...</i>

04:37.944 --> 04:39.696
<i>or the next Steve Guttenberg.</i>

04:41.614 --> 04:44.617
<i>Now, in the original experiment, they just</i>
<i>waited to see what happened. But...</i>

04:45.285 --> 04:46.911
<i>I don't have the patience for that.</i>

05:35.251 --> 05:36.627
This is painful to watch.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.470
All right-- Oh.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.512
You ate it.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.058
-That's OK.
-I didn't eat it.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.268
I lifted the cup and it was gone.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.771
-How did you do?
-Good.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.197
-Was it good?
-Yeah.

06:04.405 --> 06:07.492
After I lifted up the cup,
it just disappeared!

06:07.658 --> 06:09.869
-What disappeared?
-The marshmallow.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.746
Would you like another one?

06:12.288 --> 06:14.624
-Yeah. It just disappeared.
-Aw, buddy, here.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.042
You want to eat this one?

06:16.626 --> 06:18.544
It's OK. You can eat this one.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.964
-It disappeared like magic?
-Yeah! Well, eat this one. Tell me how it tastes.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.220
-It's good.
-Is it good?

06:27.512 --> 06:28.930
<i>Well, we made a kid cry.</i>

06:29.013 --> 06:31.516
<i>So I'd say phase one was a success.</i>

06:31.933 --> 06:34.644
<i>For phase two,</i>
<i>I went undercover as a kid myself</i>

06:35.228 --> 06:38.189
<i>to apply a little peer pressure</i>
<i>on my fellow test subjects.</i>

06:39.399 --> 06:40.441
How's it going?

06:40.817 --> 06:41.651
Good.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.112
-What do we do?
-I don't know.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.239
<i>Once the rules were explained,</i>

06:46.322 --> 06:49.659
<i>the dilemma of self-control</i>
<i>dominated the conversation.</i>

06:49.784 --> 06:52.328
One time, I kept waiting and waiting.

06:53.704 --> 06:54.622
For what?

06:54.914 --> 06:56.874
For my lasagna.

07:02.046 --> 07:03.172
Are we allowed to touch them?

07:03.923 --> 07:05.258
I do not know.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.969
You like marshmallows?
I love marshmallows too.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.512
That's why it's hard to wait.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.849
-I know. I also like s'mores.
-I love s'mores.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.934
-And Rice Krispies Treats.
-Love it.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.061
Can I show you something cool
with your marshmallow?

07:17.603 --> 07:18.688
Give me your plate.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.274
OK. Here.

07:23.192 --> 07:24.026
You ready?

07:24.986 --> 07:26.320
Watch the marshmallow.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.254
Impressing.

08:02.231 --> 08:05.151
-Grab yours.
-I'm gonna wait.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.195
-You sure?
-I'm sure.

08:29.884 --> 08:30.801
I'm sorry.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.428
It's OK.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.246
Whoa!

09:17.431 --> 09:18.641
What just happened?

09:19.267 --> 09:23.813
You've been coughing out
and sneezing out marshmallows.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.357
If she comes back in and sees all these,

09:26.440 --> 09:28.568
she's gonna suspect
we're up to some high jinks.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.611
I'm gonna stuff some in my pockets.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.488
We'll get in trouble if she sees them.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.784
I know that... They'll know that--

09:36.867 --> 09:39.287
No, I don't think
they would have looked at me that close.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.663
Can you put those in here?

09:44.959 --> 09:47.920
OK. Nicely done, Justin.

09:48.838 --> 09:49.755
Good job.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.429
I think I'm going to be sick.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.183
-I'm Justin. What's your name?
-I'm Susan.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.019
Susan. You know what that means?

10:03.102 --> 10:05.229
-No, what?
-It's time for Magic for Susans.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.150
OK. Check it out, Susan.

10:09.859 --> 10:10.776
Soda can.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.323
-Can I borrow your ring?
-Sure you can.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.949
-Is that OK?
-That's great, yes.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.159
-All right.
-There you go.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.453
-You're gonna remember this forever.
-OK.

10:20.536 --> 10:23.164
Your ring... and a can. Watch.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.003
That's amazing.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.051
-Can it come out?
-No.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.306
Now, what do we do?

10:40.640 --> 10:41.682
Have a good day.

10:45.019 --> 10:48.397
<i>I like to think I have free will</i>
<i>and control over my destiny,</i>

10:48.481 --> 10:51.025
<i>but mindfulness expert</i>
<i>Paul Kaye disagrees.</i>

10:51.567 --> 10:54.195
<i>He says the only thing</i>
<i>I actually have control over</i>

10:54.278 --> 10:57.573
<i>is how I react to all the stuff</i>
<i>I don't have control over.</i>

10:57.657 --> 10:59.158
So when things aren't going our way,

10:59.241 --> 11:01.744
automatically we kind of get upset.

11:02.244 --> 11:05.539
So if we can go the way
that things are going,

11:05.623 --> 11:06.957
suddenly we're in harmony,

11:07.041 --> 11:10.002
and it may look like we're in control,
but all we're doing

11:10.086 --> 11:11.671
is being with what is going on.

11:11.754 --> 11:15.633
So does that come out of having
no expectations and no attachments

11:15.716 --> 11:18.052
to how we want things to pan out?

11:18.135 --> 11:21.472
If you can. It's there. It's always there.

11:21.597 --> 11:22.932
-Take me there.
-OK.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.768
Just take a moment
and bring your attention

11:25.851 --> 11:27.978
to the rising and falling of your breath.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.525
You were trying a little hard there.

11:32.608 --> 11:36.654
Just carry on breathing, except you're
bringing your attention to it.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.117
OK. A palpable change.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.785
Look at you.
That's a complete difference.

11:42.868 --> 11:46.789
You get to a point where you realize,
"Wait a minute. I'm not breathing.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.125
I'm being breathed."

11:50.459 --> 11:53.337
<i>Smile like you know</i>
<i>what he's talking about...</i>

11:53.838 --> 11:55.589
<i>and go to the next segment.</i>

11:56.382 --> 12:00.386
<i>If Paul is right that true happiness</i>
<i>comes from going with the flow,</i>

12:00.469 --> 12:04.432
<i>then these outgoing high school seniors</i>
<i>may have to rethink their future plans.</i>

12:04.515 --> 12:05.891
-I'm Justin.
-I'm Emma.

12:06.225 --> 12:09.353
I'm filming a little piece today
about free will.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.022
-OK.
-Do you believe you have free will?

12:13.023 --> 12:13.899
Yes.

12:13.983 --> 12:17.319
I feel like our path more so chooses us
than us choosing our path.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.904
-Fate?
-Yeah, absolutely.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.990
-I guess both.
-Yeah?

12:21.073 --> 12:23.284
I think fate has a lot to do with it,

12:23.367 --> 12:26.412
but then I also think
that if you never really do anything,

12:26.495 --> 12:27.788
nothing's gonna happen for you.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.958
Did you notice my dart board I brought?

12:31.584 --> 12:32.710
[girl] I did now.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.962
-Check it out.
-Yeah, it's neat.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.256
30 different occupations.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.925
Any of these kind of... calling your name?

12:42.261 --> 12:44.430
-Dad. I like the "dad" one right there.
-Yeah?

12:44.513 --> 12:46.724
I like that.
There's a lot of money in that.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.809
-This is more than just a dart.
-OK.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.227
This dart represents your future.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.395
Just give it a toss.

12:51.812 --> 12:52.980
What if I don't hit the board?

12:53.981 --> 12:55.775
-Then it's embarrassing.
-OK.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.528
See? I told you!

12:59.779 --> 13:01.906
-It's OK. I have another dart.
-OK.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.324
Step a little closer.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.201
-OK.
-OK.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.745
-That's as close as you can get.
-I'll hit something.

13:09.538 --> 13:10.664
-Cult.
-Cult?

13:10.748 --> 13:12.958
-Does that mean I'm like a leader?
-OK, well...

13:13.042 --> 13:16.337
Let's think about this for a second.
First off, of the whole board,

13:16.420 --> 13:19.590
was there anything that you maybe thought
you were going to do?

13:21.133 --> 13:23.302
I thought I might hit the "mom" one.

13:23.803 --> 13:24.929
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.265
-You wanna be a mom?
-At some point.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.558
Way far away.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.185
-Way far away.
-Way, way away!

13:31.268 --> 13:33.354
But would you have ever thought
you would be...

13:34.146 --> 13:35.064
in a cult?

13:36.065 --> 13:36.941
Probably not.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.318
Did you know that I knew
you would be in a cult?

13:39.401 --> 13:40.694
-You did? How?
-Yeah.

13:40.820 --> 13:44.365
Before you even threw this dart, I knew
I was gonna meet a future cult leader.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.659
That's why I wrote that.

13:47.618 --> 13:48.536
Oh, my God!

13:51.831 --> 13:56.001
Nurse. Would you be weirded out if I knew
you'd hit "nurse" before you hit it?

13:56.085 --> 13:56.961
Really?

14:00.756 --> 14:02.091
All right, man!

14:03.050 --> 14:04.218
You see, now that's...

14:08.138 --> 14:08.973
Mayor.

14:18.649 --> 14:19.859
What the heck?

14:19.942 --> 14:21.610
That was pretty mind-blowing!

14:22.152 --> 14:25.531
I hit "cult" and on the back of the thing,
he had written "cult"!

14:29.410 --> 14:30.369
What's your name?

14:31.245 --> 14:32.830
-I'm Susan.
-I'm Justin.

14:32.913 --> 14:35.165
-Hi.
-So nice to meet you, Susan. You know why?

14:35.249 --> 14:37.167
-Why?
-It's Magic for Susans.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.088
Really? That's awesome.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.506
-It's pretty awesome, right?
-Yeah.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.009
Susan, I have a deck of cards.
Say "stop" whenever you want.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.219
-Stop.
-Right there?

14:48.137 --> 14:49.680
OK. Can you memorize that card?

14:51.223 --> 14:52.266
Don't forget it.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.269
Susan's card. OK?

14:55.853 --> 14:58.647
-I'm going to give you a souvenir, Susan.
-OK.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.276
Actually just going to...

15:02.818 --> 15:04.653
tear off the corner here.

15:09.533 --> 15:10.409
Wow!

15:11.285 --> 15:12.620
And make it disappear.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.914
-Wow!
-Do you know where it went?

15:15.164 --> 15:15.998
No.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.667
-Do you have a purse?
-Yes.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.169
Bring the purse over here.

15:23.631 --> 15:24.798
Check the pocket.

15:25.382 --> 15:26.425
Which side?

15:42.650 --> 15:43.901
Oh, my gosh!

15:45.277 --> 15:46.111
What?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.115
How is that possible?

15:53.786 --> 15:57.539
<i>I have a lot of crap,</i>
<i>and little by little,</i>

15:57.623 --> 15:58.832
<i>it's taking over my life.</i>

15:58.916 --> 16:01.543
<i>But then I heard about these people</i>
<i>called minimalists.</i>

16:01.627 --> 16:04.880
This is literally everything that I own.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.007
<i>I'd love to fit everything I own</i>
<i>into a backpack,</i>

16:07.091 --> 16:09.635
<i>but I don't want to get rid of anything.</i>
<i>Solution?</i>

16:09.927 --> 16:11.053
<i>Magic backpack.</i>

16:11.136 --> 16:12.429
You guys heard of minimalism?

16:13.138 --> 16:13.973
-No.
-What is that?

16:14.056 --> 16:15.766
Are you familiar with minimalism?

16:15.849 --> 16:16.934
I have heard of the word.

16:17.017 --> 16:18.477
I got this buddy who...

16:19.228 --> 16:22.648
He cut out all the extra stuff
and now he can live out of a backpack.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.609
It's not as bad as it sounds,
because I found a loophole.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.779
-I just have a magic backpack.
-That's cool!

16:28.862 --> 16:32.282
What's the number one thing that you'd
prefer to not have to live without?

16:32.366 --> 16:33.701
I like to have fun.

16:34.576 --> 16:36.161
-I like to have fun.
-Fun.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.538
I got fun in my bag.

16:37.621 --> 16:38.747
You have fun in your bag?

16:38.831 --> 16:40.958
I got fun. Let's see here.

16:42.793 --> 16:43.794
What?

16:44.336 --> 16:45.504
-That's fun.
-Light it up!

16:45.587 --> 16:47.840
That's fun. Hold that.

16:48.465 --> 16:49.675
You like baseball?

16:50.718 --> 16:52.594
I like baseball. That's fun.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.054
How did you even... ?

16:54.138 --> 16:56.015
It was in the... What?

16:57.558 --> 16:58.934
My gosh! What?

16:59.018 --> 17:01.270
What's something you would prefer
to not live without?

17:01.353 --> 17:02.855
-I like cookies.
-Well, actually...

17:05.482 --> 17:06.316
Hold on.

17:07.026 --> 17:07.901
We have...

17:08.652 --> 17:09.611
my childhood...

17:10.779 --> 17:11.613
cookie jar. No way.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.909
It's actually got some...
Come on over. Check it out.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.661
We got some Oreos in there.

17:20.622 --> 17:23.333
Cookies. Seriously, minimalism is easy
when you got one of these bags.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.335
Come on, what else can't you live without?

17:27.337 --> 17:28.672
I blend a lot of things.

17:28.839 --> 17:31.050
OK, you're tricky.
You're trying to stump me.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.262
No! I can't...

17:35.512 --> 17:36.805
I can't believe that.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.182
OK.

17:38.974 --> 17:39.933
What?

17:40.225 --> 17:41.101
There's that.

17:41.685 --> 17:44.688
What else? Come on, what else? What's
another thing you couldn't live without?

17:46.440 --> 17:48.275
-What do you need?
-Coffee.

17:48.358 --> 17:49.693
-Coffee?
-I love coffee.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.196
Coffee. That's me every day.
I grew up on coffee.

17:52.279 --> 17:53.864
I'm a coffee guy too.

17:53.947 --> 17:56.492
-Yeah!
-If he pulls a Starbucks out of his...

17:56.575 --> 17:58.285
-You got the cup.
-Got the cup.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.120
-Hold on to that.
-Nice.

18:01.538 --> 18:04.249
Actually, hold on.
You know, better than the cup...

18:06.085 --> 18:06.960
No way!

18:09.379 --> 18:11.298
-There we go.
-Get out!

18:11.965 --> 18:13.008
Come on.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.845
How did you get that in there?

18:20.224 --> 18:22.059
Take a sip.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.143
How is it?

18:24.436 --> 18:25.854
Wow, it's still hot!

18:25.938 --> 18:27.314
You have a good one!

18:28.190 --> 18:29.775
I got it.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.110
Have a good one.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.362
-What else can you not live without?
-An umbrella.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.780
-An umbrella?
-Yeah.

18:34.905 --> 18:35.989
OK, hold on.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.160
Wow!

18:40.786 --> 18:43.247
It's so big and black and...

18:43.705 --> 18:44.873
-Go on.
-Oh, my gosh!

18:45.666 --> 18:48.168
Is there anything
that you just couldn't live without?

18:53.632 --> 18:54.591
My wife.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.136
-My wife?
-Yeah.

18:57.594 --> 19:00.514
-I can't live without her.
-See, that's not fair,

19:00.597 --> 19:03.308
'cause I'm not gonna put my wife
in my backpack.

19:05.144 --> 19:05.978
But...

19:06.436 --> 19:08.272
that's why I do keep a...

19:10.732 --> 19:12.234
-bigger bag...
-OK.

19:12.442 --> 19:13.694
...inside the backpack.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.696
All right.

19:19.449 --> 19:20.909
And inside the bigger bag...

19:21.535 --> 19:23.370
is where I keep the important stuff.

19:23.620 --> 19:24.746
-What?
-What the...

19:26.331 --> 19:27.624
That's my wife. Hi, babe.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.252
-He did not bring her out that bag.
-This is Jill.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.921
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you. How you did that?

19:34.715 --> 19:37.926
Do you mean how did I make her appear
or how did I manage to marry her?

19:40.137 --> 19:42.264
<i>I don't just have trouble</i>
<i>controlling my stuff.</i>

19:42.347 --> 19:45.684
<i>I also have trouble controlling my mouth.</i>
<i>I talk a lot.</i>

19:45.767 --> 19:49.021
<i>So here I am attempting magic</i>
<i>without speaking.</i>

19:51.440 --> 19:52.441
Yeah.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.610
Most definitely! What do you have for us?

19:56.862 --> 19:59.114
I love froyo.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.368
-For me?
-Where's the spoon?

20:17.591 --> 20:19.426
Sprinkles. I pick sprinkles.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.311
Where are they?

20:39.196 --> 20:40.072
Oreos.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.496
Oh, my God! No!

20:49.081 --> 20:50.415
I don't want them anymore!

20:51.166 --> 20:52.334
Let's go for hot fudge.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.628
Hot fudge.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.298
OK. How?

21:14.564 --> 21:15.399
That's...

21:17.901 --> 21:21.029
Yeah, you know what?
I appreciate the novelty of that, but no.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.619
Part of me doesn't want to eat it
because you spit it out.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.372
The other part of me is like,
"Free froyo," you know?

21:33.417 --> 21:37.004
<i>That's me walking</i>
<i>to my very first yoga class.</i>

21:38.046 --> 21:39.256
Welcome, everyone.

21:39.339 --> 21:41.425
<i>Usually my lack of willpower prevents me</i>

21:41.508 --> 21:44.553
<i>from engaging in such healthy</i>
<i>and boring activities.</i>

21:44.720 --> 21:49.266
<i>But this yoga class offered something new</i>
<i>I just couldn't resist.</i>

21:49.683 --> 21:50.684
<i>Goats.</i>

21:51.435 --> 21:53.729
<i>Goat yoga is a real thing.</i>

21:53.812 --> 21:56.898
<i>You do yoga while hanging out with goats.</i>

21:57.149 --> 21:59.818
<i>Goat yoga instructor</i>
<i>Meredith Schwartz explains.</i>

21:59.901 --> 22:02.279
So, Meredith, are goats good at yoga?

22:02.612 --> 22:05.657
They are, actually.
They really are good at yoga.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.243
You can find yourself balancing
and a goat might come over

22:08.327 --> 22:10.996
when you just think you can't hold
that pose any more.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.581
The goat might help you.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.124
What does PETA think about it?

22:15.125 --> 22:17.169
-Who's PETA?
-[goat bleats]

22:17.252 --> 22:20.088
-Perfect. Here, why don't you hold a goat?
-I'll take it.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.548
Come towards me.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.636
Justin, maybe we're going to give you
a couple more blocks.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.472
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Perfect.

22:28.764 --> 22:31.058
Hollow out underneath your armpits.
Let your head hang.

22:31.933 --> 22:33.727
<i>Turns out, after five minutes,</i>

22:33.810 --> 22:36.313
<i>goat yoga is just yoga.</i>

22:37.230 --> 22:40.233
<i>But then she put that goat on my back.</i>

22:40.650 --> 22:44.780
<i>My chakras aligned, and that's when</i>
<i>something amazing happened.</i>

23:06.009 --> 23:07.260
[silently mouths]

23:12.182 --> 23:14.768
I've got 20/20 vision,
but that was [bleep] up!

23:29.950 --> 23:33.120
I'm pretty sure I was in the wrong class,
'cause I don't know what just happened.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.913
He just went up.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.844
We try so hard to control things.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.264
But maybe the real lesson

23:52.347 --> 23:53.640
is that control...

23:54.433 --> 23:55.642
is overrated.

23:56.309 --> 23:58.019
Maybe just eat that first marshmallow

23:58.103 --> 24:00.439
and pretend the second one
doesn't even exist.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.482
'Cause, come on...

24:03.316 --> 24:04.985
Eating a marshmallow never hurt anyone.

24:09.322 --> 24:10.157
