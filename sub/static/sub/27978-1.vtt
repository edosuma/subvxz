00:12.360 --> 00:13.796
Most people ask me
if the Gotti name

00:13.839 --> 00:16.712
helped or hindered my career.

00:16.755 --> 00:18.279
You be the judge.

00:18.322 --> 00:21.108
We'll try and keep the
interviews as short as possible.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.979
Ten radio, ten television.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.459
Now that your father's in jail,

00:24.502 --> 00:25.851
will you be taking over as
head of the mob?

00:25.895 --> 00:27.114
Keep the questions
to the book, okay?

00:27.157 --> 00:28.941
Yes, but how is your dad?

00:28.985 --> 00:30.552
Rumour has it, he isn't well.

00:36.340 --> 00:39.126
Mommy! Mommy!

00:39.169 --> 00:40.388
Hi boys!

00:40.431 --> 00:41.128
Hi!

00:41.171 --> 00:42.999
Daddy made us something!

00:43.043 --> 00:43.913
Did he?

00:43.956 --> 00:44.783
Lucky you.

00:44.827 --> 00:45.958
Hello!

00:50.267 --> 00:52.182
You didn't stay long tonight.

00:52.226 --> 00:55.751
The kids were bored,
so I took 'em home early.

00:55.794 --> 01:00.408
Besides, you know how I feel
about you working.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.453
Can't you just support me?

01:08.198 --> 01:13.638
[phone rings]

01:17.120 --> 01:18.861
Hello?

01:18.904 --> 01:19.601
[Operator] Collect call from
the correctional facility.

01:19.644 --> 01:21.081
Do you accept?

01:21.124 --> 01:23.083
Yeah.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.258
[whispers] Dad.

01:24.301 --> 01:26.999
Hey, kiddo. Sorry
to call you so late.

01:27.043 --> 01:28.610
How are you?

01:31.917 --> 01:33.658
[quietly] What is it?

01:33.702 --> 01:37.271
I can tell something is wrong.
Just tell me.

01:37.314 --> 01:41.536
Uh... The test results are back.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.103
And?

01:43.146 --> 01:44.843
It's cancer.

01:52.851 --> 01:59.162
Okay, well... we'll...we'll
fight it.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.817
[tearfully]
Yeah.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.211
He's right here;
I love you too.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.953
Okay.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.693
Okay, bye.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.187
[cries]

02:25.667 --> 02:28.931
[phone rings]

02:28.974 --> 02:30.150
Yeah?

02:35.198 --> 02:36.373
They're here.

02:43.424 --> 02:46.383
I was born with a congenital
heart defect.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.776
According to the doctors,

02:47.819 --> 02:50.213
I should have been dead
a year earlier.

02:50.257 --> 02:53.173
That morning, I wished
I was.

02:56.915 --> 03:01.093
I'm Victoria Gotti, and this is
the story of my father and me.

03:02.094 --> 03:03.792
[screaming]

03:03.835 --> 03:06.055
Push. Push. Give us
a big, hard push.

03:06.098 --> 03:08.753
[pained]
Call my husband!
I want my husband!

03:08.797 --> 03:09.885
Come on now,
you can do this.

03:09.928 --> 03:11.103
No, I can't!

03:11.147 --> 03:12.148
You're gonna be fine.

03:12.192 --> 03:12.931
Just look at the clock.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.194
I won't look at a clock!

03:14.237 --> 03:15.586
I want my husband!

03:15.630 --> 03:18.110
[phone rings]

03:22.680 --> 03:23.725
Yeah?

03:23.768 --> 03:25.117
Yeah, hang on.

03:25.161 --> 03:27.032
It's the hospital.

03:27.076 --> 03:28.469
Okay.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.255
Yeah?

03:34.866 --> 03:36.912
We gotta go, Ange.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.740
This one's gonna be a boy.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.925
Butch! We gotta go!

03:49.968 --> 03:51.318
Wake up.

03:51.361 --> 03:52.232
She's beautiful.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.581
Where were you?

03:53.624 --> 03:54.669
What happened to your face?

03:54.712 --> 03:56.410
Don't worry about it.
We gotta go.

03:56.453 --> 03:59.151
I've told this story
a million times.

04:00.892 --> 04:03.634
About how my father stole me
from the hospital.

04:03.678 --> 04:06.289
Since they didn't have money
to pay the bill.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.031
It sets my father up
as a noble criminal.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.293
A Robin Hood.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.208
[weakly] I just
had a baby.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.819
I often joke that stealing me
from the hospital was the most

04:14.863 --> 04:19.694
lucrative heist of Dad's life,
but looking back on all of it,

04:19.737 --> 04:23.263
all I can think of "kid,
you were royally screwed."

04:29.094 --> 04:31.662
[loud buzzer]

04:31.706 --> 04:32.968
Look at us.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.622
We were so young then.

04:34.665 --> 04:37.146
My sister Angel,
she's on the right.

04:37.189 --> 04:39.496
That's me. John Junior
was five.

04:39.540 --> 04:44.066
Now, remember.
Your father works here,

04:44.109 --> 04:47.548
so you all need to be on
your best behaviour.

04:47.591 --> 04:50.115
Daddy is helping build
this place.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.900
But, we still gotta follow the
rules if we want to see him,

04:51.943 --> 04:53.945
you got it?

04:53.989 --> 04:56.339
Frankie, the youngest,
was at home.

04:59.386 --> 05:02.302
[heavy creaking door opens]

05:02.345 --> 05:04.695
Gotti family?
Let's go.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.439
[laughs]

05:09.483 --> 05:12.181
Dad.

05:12.224 --> 05:13.095
My little princess.

05:13.138 --> 05:16.011
Hi, Dad.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.404
John.

05:17.447 --> 05:20.015
Hi Dad.

05:20.058 --> 05:21.059
Hi John.

05:21.103 --> 05:23.105
[whispered] How are ya?

05:23.148 --> 05:27.979
Victoria. Mom said
you love to read.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.067
[whispers] You're my smart one.

05:29.111 --> 05:31.113
[laughs]

05:31.156 --> 05:32.375
Make sure she gets
a library card.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.550
Yeah.

05:33.594 --> 05:34.421
Dad, guess what?

05:34.464 --> 05:35.291
What?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.248
I know how to play chess.

05:36.292 --> 05:37.206
Yeah?

05:37.249 --> 05:39.687
I hope we can play one day.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.166
We will.

05:44.648 --> 05:47.216
You don't look so good.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.087
What's the matter with her?

05:49.131 --> 05:50.045
Nothing.

05:50.088 --> 05:50.915
Huh?

05:50.959 --> 05:52.003
She can hardly speak.

05:52.047 --> 05:53.396
She's fine, just-

05:53.440 --> 05:56.007
We're all just really tired.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.008
Everything okay?

05:57.052 --> 05:58.270
Come here.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.402
There was nothing wrong
with me.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.099
I was just painfully shy.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.885
Plus, the stories my mother
told us about Dad's job

06:03.928 --> 06:07.628
and him working so far away
from home just didn't add up.

06:07.671 --> 06:10.195
They acted like I couldn't see
the armed guards,

06:10.239 --> 06:12.372
and they wondered what
was wrong with me?

06:12.415 --> 06:14.156
Dad, do you like my dress?

06:14.199 --> 06:16.898
Your dress is beautiful.
Give me a kiss on the cheek.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.160
All right.

06:18.203 --> 06:19.596
Butch. What's going on?

06:19.640 --> 06:20.945
You need some money?

06:20.989 --> 06:22.294
I told you, we're all just
really tired.

06:22.338 --> 06:23.470
Oh.

06:23.513 --> 06:24.732
We got a four-hour drive home,

06:24.775 --> 06:26.255
and I still gotta go pick up
Frankie.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.475
It's not gonna be forever.

06:28.518 --> 06:29.824
Promise I'll make it up to ya.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.565
Gotti family.

06:31.608 --> 06:32.957
Time's up.

06:36.091 --> 06:37.788
Go hug your father, kids.

06:40.008 --> 06:42.358
Time to get to work.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.620
Give me a hug.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.058
Okay.

06:47.102 --> 06:48.059
Go, go.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.104
Bye, Dad.

06:49.147 --> 06:50.453
Bye. Bye. Bye.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.112
[sighs]

07:05.990 --> 07:07.949
[door slams heavily]

07:10.908 --> 07:12.562
Mom was more than tired.

07:12.606 --> 07:15.870
I know that now, as a mother
of three myself,

07:15.913 --> 07:18.046
with so much more
than my mother had.

07:18.089 --> 07:21.353
Before she got married,
she had a job.

07:21.397 --> 07:24.400
But as an Italian mother, you
didn't work outside the home.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.010
It wasn't done.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.838
She missed my father.
We all did.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.797
But she never complained.

07:37.935 --> 07:40.111
...And sometimes, he
lets me ride in the car.

07:40.155 --> 07:42.113
[excitedly] And he'll
turn on the siren.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.463
Thank you, Vinnie.

07:43.506 --> 07:45.813
And thank your uncle
for keeping us safe.

07:45.856 --> 07:47.205
Have a seat.

07:49.207 --> 07:53.168
Victoria Gotti, come on up,
read us your report.

07:55.257 --> 07:59.217
I remembered having just come
back from visiting my dad.

07:59.261 --> 08:02.003
Do I have to call
your mother again?

08:02.046 --> 08:05.397
...and, I started to become
a very anxious child.

08:05.441 --> 08:10.141
I was agitated, I could
not sleep a lot of nights.

08:10.185 --> 08:12.709
My mother never knew
what was wrong with me.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.798
But the anxiety was already
setting in,

08:14.842 --> 08:18.106
and it was more to do
with my dad's life

08:18.149 --> 08:21.239
and what I didn't
know about that.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.941
[Softly] My hero is my father.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.508
Louder, Victoria.

08:29.770 --> 08:32.207
My hero is my father.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.861
He works on big buildings.

08:33.904 --> 08:36.254
He's a construction foreman,
and he wears a hard hat.

08:36.298 --> 08:38.169
He's not a foreman!
He's a jailbird!

08:38.212 --> 08:39.344
My mom said so.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.563
Everyone knows.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.086
That's enough!

08:45.089 --> 08:48.876
Being made fun of in front of
my whole class was bad enough.

08:48.919 --> 08:52.401
But hearing what I'd always
suspected about my father

08:52.444 --> 08:54.185
left me distraught.

08:59.234 --> 09:00.888
Why did they call Daddy
a jailbird?

09:00.931 --> 09:03.020
I already told you, your father
works in construction

09:03.064 --> 09:04.718
and that's all there
is to say about it.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.546
So then why can't Daddy make it
to see me get my teacher's award

09:06.589 --> 09:07.590
at the graduation?

09:07.634 --> 09:08.678
It doesn't work like that.

09:08.722 --> 09:09.505
Daddy said he might be
home then.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.550
He said he "might be".

09:10.593 --> 09:11.681
What do you want from me?

09:11.725 --> 09:12.856
The teacher said
only two kids

09:12.900 --> 09:14.118
in the whole district
get the award.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.119
Daddy can't miss it.

09:15.163 --> 09:15.859
Enough.

09:15.903 --> 09:16.599
[cash register dings]

09:16.643 --> 09:17.557
$15.

09:19.471 --> 09:20.516
What's all this?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.952
Food stamps?

09:21.996 --> 09:23.911
It's as good as money.
Just take it.

09:23.954 --> 09:26.957
Can I get some help?
This lady don't got no money!

09:32.963 --> 09:35.139
She's fine.
Ring it up.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.060
[bell on door jingles]

09:43.104 --> 09:44.322
[classroom bell rings]

09:44.366 --> 09:45.802
You did good, Vic.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.500
Come here.

09:48.544 --> 09:49.676
Daddy!

09:49.719 --> 09:50.981
[laughs]

09:53.244 --> 09:54.376
My big winner!

09:54.419 --> 09:55.856
Haaaaa!

09:55.899 --> 09:58.075
The United Federation
of Teachers Award.

09:58.119 --> 09:59.642
Can I borrow it?

09:59.686 --> 10:01.209
Sure.

10:01.252 --> 10:02.123
All right, I'll give it to you
later. I gotta run.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.604
No, Daddy, you just got here.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.738
[crying]

10:08.782 --> 10:10.653
Listen to me.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.830
You don't get many tears
in life.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.616
Don't waste 'em all up here.

10:16.659 --> 10:19.619
Now, listen. I gotta take
care of some business.

10:19.662 --> 10:22.622
So, you tell your brothers
and your sister

10:22.665 --> 10:24.406
I'll be home for dinner.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.935
Where is he going?

10:31.979 --> 10:33.981
To show off.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.375
I didn't want to let him go,
I was hugging him so...

10:37.419 --> 10:39.334
so tight, and he left.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.901
And I was so upset.

10:40.944 --> 10:44.644
He took the awards,
but he didn't take me.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.384
And I was crying, and
my mother said to me:

10:46.428 --> 10:48.169
"Your father is
going to show off.

10:48.212 --> 10:53.304
"That's his way of showing
how proud he is of you."

10:53.348 --> 10:56.307
-How's your ma!
-Yeah, she's good, she's good!

10:56.351 --> 11:00.181
[car horn]

11:00.224 --> 11:01.486
Look at this automobile!

11:01.530 --> 11:03.097
-Dad!
-Daddy!

11:03.140 --> 11:05.142
Didn't I tell you I'd be home
by dinner?

11:05.186 --> 11:06.448
Yeah.

11:06.491 --> 11:07.928
Hey, Frankie, come say hello
to Daddy.

11:07.971 --> 11:08.668
Hey kid!

11:08.711 --> 11:09.581
[heavy thump]

11:09.625 --> 11:11.583
[screaming]
Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!

11:11.627 --> 11:12.715
[furious] Who's screaming!
Which one of you?

11:12.759 --> 11:13.716
Frankie! Frankie, what happened?

11:13.760 --> 11:14.891

01:19:46.477 --> 01:19:49.175
I had been told to stay strong
my entire life,

01:19:51.003 --> 01:19:53.223
but that day was too much
for me.

It's time to get up, okay?

01:20:16.724 --> 01:20:18.204
Let's go.

01:20:18.248 --> 01:20:21.120
I didn't know where to begin.

01:20:21.164 --> 01:20:24.471
I never imagined myself
raising three sons alone.

01:20:24.515 --> 01:20:29.085
And in my spare time,
there was my career.

01:20:29.128 --> 01:20:33.350
My book contracts,
my newspaper column.

01:20:33.393 --> 01:20:35.134
I fought to stay strong.

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:39.835
When Dad told me he had
throat cancer,

01:20:39.878 --> 01:20:41.967
he didn't want the rest
of the family to know.

01:20:42.011 --> 01:20:44.970
He only told me in case it got
leaked to the papers.

01:20:45.014 --> 01:20:47.103
How are you, Daddy?

01:20:47.146 --> 01:20:48.974
I can think of a couple of
other places I'd rather be,

01:20:49.018 --> 01:20:51.020
but I'm okay.

01:20:51.063 --> 01:20:52.848
How are you feeling?

01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:54.327
Are the doctors taking
care of you?

Listen, did I ever tell you
the story

01:21:02.118 --> 01:21:04.729
about my brother
peeing on my father?

01:21:04.772 --> 01:21:05.773
And they blamed me?

01:21:05.817 --> 01:21:07.253
Yes, you've told me that story.

01:21:07.297 --> 01:21:08.733
But I don't... I don't want you
to tell me stories.

01:21:08.776 --> 01:21:10.909
I want to talk to you.

01:21:10.953 --> 01:21:12.955
Isn't that what we're doing?

01:21:16.567 --> 01:21:19.918
I read your book.

01:21:19.962 --> 01:21:21.311
I liked it.

01:21:21.354 --> 01:21:22.790
I'm sensing a but coming on.

01:21:27.926 --> 01:21:31.451
You know, I could never get
anything past you.

01:21:31.495 --> 01:21:33.758
You should be very proud.

01:21:33.801 --> 01:21:35.412
I know I am.

01:21:42.201 --> 01:21:44.987
Do me a favour.

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:48.860
Yeah, what is it?

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:55.736
When you write another book,
how about a love story?

01:21:55.780 --> 01:22:01.220
I want to know that you're swept
up in love and romance,

01:22:01.264 --> 01:22:07.270
not crime and murder.

01:22:07.313 --> 01:22:09.620
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.

01:22:17.323 --> 01:22:21.066
I really miss you, Dad.

01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:27.159
I always admired your strength
through all the hard times.

01:22:27.203 --> 01:22:32.121
You know, strength comes
from within.
