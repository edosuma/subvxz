WEBVTT

00:01.515 --> 00:03.312
Just got a call
from the Medical Board.

00:03.375 --> 00:04.506
Someone from the prison

00:04.594 --> 00:06.615
has reported me
for medical misconduct.

00:06.805 --> 00:07.818
Why?

00:07.914 --> 00:10.717
I failed to document
Liz's psychotic episodes,

00:10.805 --> 00:12.537
after she started
taking the drug.

00:12.625 --> 00:14.850
I might have to take
Liz off Psuldrycin.

00:15.293 --> 00:16.785
I want to place another
bet with your guy.

00:16.872 --> 00:19.919
Oh, Linda, you're
already 20K in the hole.

00:20.236 --> 00:22.584
Leak these
to the press immediately.

00:22.912 --> 00:25.839
I'm, uh, shocked and
deeply disappointed to learn

00:26.060 --> 00:29.209
of Mr Channing's involvement
in this sordid business.

00:29.420 --> 00:30.967
Did you do that?

00:38.646 --> 00:40.021
- Ruby?
- Ruby!

00:40.109 --> 00:42.724
The scans confirmed
a burst aneurysm.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.287
She'll need
urgent surgery.

00:44.375 --> 00:45.784
Now you'll know
how it feels

00:45.872 --> 00:46.854
when your own
flesh and blood

00:46.942 --> 00:48.899
- has to die alone.
- Ah!

00:49.138 --> 00:50.908
Rita! No! Don't!

00:53.329 --> 00:57.579
Ruby! Ruby!

00:58.394 --> 00:59.563
Come with me.

01:03.069 --> 01:04.599
Oh, fuck!

01:05.630 --> 01:06.936
How're you feeling?

01:07.024 --> 01:08.947
I was looking
for you.

01:09.079 --> 01:11.782
Been here the whole time,
little Kangaruby.

03:03.499 --> 03:04.873
The hospital said
they'd send

03:05.015 --> 03:07.009
Mitchell's discharge
papers through. Can...

03:09.144 --> 03:10.470
Thanks.

03:12.368 --> 03:15.087
Will, it's been weeks.
How long are you going to do this?

03:16.898 --> 03:18.822
I admitted breaching protocol.

03:18.910 --> 03:20.704
Why can't we move on?

03:21.313 --> 03:23.235
Breaching protocol.

03:24.134 --> 03:26.532
You took a fuckin'
murderer out of this prison.

03:28.055 --> 03:30.554
Well, I thought
you of all people would understand.

03:30.642 --> 03:32.853
If you were anyone else,
I would have fired you.

03:33.235 --> 03:36.806
But you knew I wouldn't do that,
and you took advantage of that.

03:36.915 --> 03:38.337
What do you want me to do,
resign?

03:38.424 --> 03:41.032
You promised me, Vera.
That's the thing.

03:41.931 --> 03:44.165
But to go behind my back
like that?

03:46.141 --> 03:49.155
The only people who know
are you, me and Connors. That's it.

03:49.305 --> 03:50.897
But you still
undermined me.

04:10.438 --> 04:11.876
Hey, Rita?

04:12.063 --> 04:13.087
- Hey, Ms Bennett.
- Hey.

04:13.175 --> 04:14.123
How's your little sugar ray?

04:14.249 --> 04:16.071
Ahh, she is kicking up
a storm.

04:16.446 --> 04:19.944
Hey, I've got some more
news on Ruby. She's fine.

04:20.031 --> 04:22.587
Her discharge papers
just came through from the hospital.

04:22.837 --> 04:25.426
But the doctors found
something unusual.

04:26.196 --> 04:28.265
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:28.353 --> 04:30.813
Have you ever known
Ruby to use Rohypnol?

04:30.954 --> 04:32.351
No. Why?

04:33.024 --> 04:35.595
The hospital found
traces of it in her blood.

04:37.337 --> 04:39.423
- What?
- Marie.

04:44.776 --> 04:46.665
She must have drugged Ruby.

04:47.907 --> 04:50.415
Oh, fuck,
she planned the whole thing.

04:50.813 --> 04:53.673
Marie put herself into
Medical to get at Ruby.

04:53.845 --> 04:55.233
I figured out
what she was up to

04:55.321 --> 04:57.164
so I got her slotted before
she could do anything.

04:57.251 --> 04:59.157
Why didn't you tell me
this before?

04:59.863 --> 05:01.790
I thought I'd dealt with it.

05:19.096 --> 05:20.946
I just wanted to say thanks.

05:23.992 --> 05:25.127
What for?

05:25.532 --> 05:27.918
The Rohypnol you gave Ruby

05:28.217 --> 05:30.522
slowed down
the bleeding in her brain.

05:30.696 --> 05:32.467
You saved her life.

05:33.070 --> 05:34.761
Well, I'm glad
your sister's OK,

05:34.849 --> 05:36.957
but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.590
You try anything
when Ruby comes back,

05:39.927 --> 05:43.076
you and Danny will be meeting up
sooner than you think.

05:45.050 --> 05:46.646
Ladies.

05:54.986 --> 05:56.388
How'd it go?

05:57.825 --> 06:00.974
- Oh, fucking bureaucrats.
- Oh, what happened?

06:01.161 --> 06:02.869
The Board's ordered me
to stop

06:02.957 --> 06:05.481
Liz's medication immediately.

06:05.569 --> 06:06.787
Oh.

06:06.875 --> 06:09.195
- What about the rest of the program?
- I'm lucky.

06:09.356 --> 06:11.364
I haven't been shut down
completely.

06:13.864 --> 06:15.528
But the pills...

06:15.668 --> 06:17.228
- the pills are working.
- I know.

06:17.371 --> 06:21.012
Yeah. And... and... and did
you tell them that you've...

06:21.192 --> 06:23.416
you've lowered the
dose and that I... I...

06:23.512 --> 06:26.635
- there's been no more episodes?
- Of course I did, yeah, Liz.

06:26.723 --> 06:29.364
Well, then, why the fuck
have they ordered you to stop?

06:29.452 --> 06:32.028
- Because they're pencil pushers.
- Oh, bullshit.

06:32.161 --> 06:34.012
Scared of losing their job.

06:41.695 --> 06:44.317
The fight's not over, Liz.

06:44.839 --> 06:47.590
OK? I'm going to look into
every alternative.

06:50.387 --> 06:52.950
How soon will
my symptoms return?

06:54.769 --> 06:57.902
Uh,
it's hard to say.

06:59.528 --> 07:01.996
A couple of days,
maybe a week.

07:09.755 --> 07:12.772
It's so amazing how, um,

07:13.293 --> 07:17.996
sweet life can be
when your mind's clear.

07:19.536 --> 07:23.731
A normal, boring life.

07:26.241 --> 07:28.184
And now I, um...

07:29.707 --> 07:33.908
I have to...
I have to go back into the muck.

07:37.059 --> 07:39.434
Do you know
what that feels like?

07:42.168 --> 07:44.371
I'm so, so sorry.

07:46.736 --> 07:48.137
So am I.

07:57.270 --> 07:58.614
Could you come back later?

07:58.715 --> 08:00.996
I just want
a new dressing for my arm.

08:01.542 --> 08:03.395
All right, sit down.

08:13.098 --> 08:14.450
Where's Nurse Shen?

08:14.543 --> 08:17.731
Oh, she couldn't come in.
Her car got stolen.

08:17.897 --> 08:20.004
- Tough break.
- Yeah.

08:21.901 --> 08:24.473
Hey, you might wanna
glove up.

08:25.523 --> 08:27.731
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.

08:27.971 --> 08:29.676
Brain fart.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.534
Agency keeping you busy?

08:40.743 --> 08:42.159
Yep.

08:48.639 --> 08:50.705
- Right, there you go.
- Yeah.

08:50.793 --> 08:52.676
- All done.
- Thanks.

09:00.072 --> 09:01.434
Jane?

09:13.235 --> 09:15.407
Do it.
Come on, do it.

09:15.809 --> 09:18.231
Come on. Fuck!

09:18.450 --> 09:20.356
Fuck! Fuck!

09:22.265 --> 09:24.739
You OK?
Linda.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.768
Nice fuckin' tip.

09:32.675 --> 09:35.014
It's not my fault that
she's a sore loser.

09:42.284 --> 09:44.235
Hey.
Have you seen Mum?

09:44.452 --> 09:46.506
Ah, no, no, why?
What's wrong?

09:46.594 --> 09:48.247
- This.
- Oh!

09:48.335 --> 09:51.403
Yeah. I bloody knew it.
I knew it! I'm gonna kill her.

09:51.491 --> 09:53.301
Oh, love,
you know how easy it is

09:53.389 --> 09:54.802
- to fall off the wagon here...
- No!

09:54.889 --> 09:56.496
You're not sticking up
for her again.

09:56.701 --> 10:01.295
I don't care if you two have some
special kinda alchy bond thing.

10:01.412 --> 10:03.428
Whatever. Mum!

10:12.155 --> 10:14.103
Oh, for fuck's sake!

10:14.865 --> 10:17.482
On the wagon,
my arse.

10:17.569 --> 10:19.569
- Wake up!
- Oh.

10:20.608 --> 10:23.834
- What happened to finding Jesus, huh?
- Who?

10:24.091 --> 10:25.433
Where'd you get it?

10:25.528 --> 10:27.239
- None of ya business.
- No, no, you tell me.

10:27.326 --> 10:29.916
Where did you get it?
Was it one of Kosta's bitches, huh?

10:30.004 --> 10:31.027
I'll fuckin' kill 'em!

10:31.115 --> 10:33.107
Nah, look,
just take it easy on her, love.

10:33.217 --> 10:36.988
I can't bloody smoke.
I can't bloody shag. What do you expect?

10:37.075 --> 10:38.767
- Oi, what's goin' on?
- Oh.

10:39.035 --> 10:42.214
Dumbo here was sticking her fat
beak where it doesn't belong.

10:42.301 --> 10:45.315
What... get out here,
both of you. Pronto.

10:45.791 --> 10:47.127
Get up!

10:47.314 --> 10:49.752
- Come on. Get up!
- Oh!

10:49.908 --> 10:51.494
Ooh.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.944
Hubba-hubba.

10:57.085 --> 11:00.280
Anyone ever tell you,
you look like Paul Newman?

11:00.527 --> 11:02.933
Gimme that ranch sauce, baby.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.020
- Mum!
- All right, that's it.

11:04.108 --> 11:05.521
You're taking a little
trip to the slot. Let's go.

11:05.608 --> 11:07.067
Oh, stop that sweet talk, babe.

11:07.155 --> 11:08.131
You're making me wet.

11:08.227 --> 11:11.645
No, um, Mr Stewart, please.
Please don't take her.

11:11.733 --> 11:13.513
- Yeah, look, we can look after her.
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.248
- Hey, check her out.
- Please.

11:16.818 --> 11:20.012
Fine. But she can't go to work
like this. She can sleep it off.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.630
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

11:21.717 --> 11:23.762
- Thanks, Mr Stewart, you're a legend.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.568
- Oh, Birdsworth.
- Yeah.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.871
- Oh! Thanks.
- Come on.

11:27.959 --> 11:29.738
Why'd you screw that
up for me?

11:29.826 --> 11:31.826
Didn't screw nothin'
up for ya.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.366
Oh!

11:52.606 --> 11:55.365
You drugged Ruby
to get at her in Medical.

11:56.411 --> 11:59.124
You are a fucking snake.

11:59.212 --> 12:00.642
What? What's going on?

12:00.729 --> 12:02.164
Wow.

12:02.511 --> 12:05.361
A lot of wild accusations
flying about today.

12:05.449 --> 12:08.472
You killed Kaz, too.
Didn't you?

12:13.135 --> 12:15.363
Now, how could I have
killed Kaz?

12:15.675 --> 12:17.154
I was with you,
remember?

12:17.285 --> 12:19.793
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

12:20.652 --> 12:21.884
I lied.

12:21.979 --> 12:24.597
- Oh, what!
- To stop you from being shivved.

12:25.082 --> 12:26.974
Bitch. I fucking knew it!

12:27.061 --> 12:28.948
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

12:29.191 --> 12:30.722
Now, that's bullshit.

12:31.113 --> 12:32.793
You're just upset we broke up.

12:32.881 --> 12:34.238
Yeah.

12:35.636 --> 12:37.190
You're not gonna get away
with it.

12:37.573 --> 12:40.022
You know,
forcefulness doesn't suit you, Allie.

12:40.266 --> 12:41.586
<i>- Come on, Marie.
- She's a bitch.</i>

12:41.854 --> 12:44.423
Winter. Drug test.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.543
Novak, get back to work.

12:46.788 --> 12:48.566
<i>What a bitch.</i>

12:48.654 --> 12:50.777
<i>- Well...
- No way.</i>

12:52.816 --> 12:55.246
Respect, girl.
That took guts.

12:56.352 --> 12:57.858
<i>What's the story?</i>

12:59.120 --> 13:01.265
I reckon there's something
going down.

13:02.229 --> 13:04.268
- What do you mean?
- I was in Medical before.

13:04.371 --> 13:06.676
There's a fill-in nurse.
Dodgy as all shit.

13:06.808 --> 13:09.941
- Dodgy how?
- Just gave me this weird vibe.

13:11.145 --> 13:13.660
Marie got Rohypnol in
from somewhere.

13:13.863 --> 13:16.183
What if she's getting more
shit in to use on Ruby?

13:16.271 --> 13:17.628
You think
the nurse is supplying her?

13:17.715 --> 13:19.418
I'm not taking
any chances.

13:19.526 --> 13:20.699
Ms Webb.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.425
- I feel sick. Can I go to Medical?
- You look fine to me.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.285
Get back to work.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.002
Eugh!

13:35.575 --> 13:37.248
Oh.

13:38.167 --> 13:39.679
- Oh! - Oh! - Oh!
- Oh! - Oh! - Oh!

13:39.767 --> 13:42.027
<i>- Disgusting!
- Aw, gross!</i>

13:42.255 --> 13:45.511
- Told you I was sick.
- Kosta, come clean this up.

13:48.514 --> 13:50.761
I'll need to take a
blood sample, as well.

13:50.886 --> 13:53.417
- Since when?
- It's new regulations.

14:06.292 --> 14:09.691
- Oh, that's a bit tight.
- It's all right, it'll be over quickly.

14:10.237 --> 14:12.167
You just pump your fist for me.

14:13.472 --> 14:14.584
Wait here.

14:24.195 --> 14:25.917
There we go.

14:48.896 --> 14:49.923
Hey!

14:50.011 --> 14:53.218
What the fuck are you doing? Get... ahh!

14:53.736 --> 14:54.764
Ahh!

14:55.969 --> 14:57.748
Get off me!

15:09.265 --> 15:11.446
Shit! Connors, get off her
now!

15:11.533 --> 15:12.710
What the hell's going on?

15:12.798 --> 15:13.866
These bitches attacked me.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.570
- They were trying to get the drugs.
- That's bullshit!

15:15.657 --> 15:17.329
- She attacked me, right?
- Slot them!

15:17.746 --> 15:18.998
Fuck you!

15:31.013 --> 15:32.251
What the hell happened?

15:32.338 --> 15:33.812
The bloody nurse attacked me.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.657
- Why?
- I have no idea.

15:37.259 --> 15:39.353
Yeah, the cops are here.
They want to speak to you.

15:39.810 --> 15:42.266
Oh, shit.

15:42.532 --> 15:46.579
Attention all staff. Visiting
hours to commence in 15 minutes.

15:56.335 --> 15:57.866
Hey, Mr Stewart?

15:57.954 --> 15:59.571
Hang on a s... sec.

15:59.821 --> 16:02.552
Um, I, uh...

16:02.719 --> 16:04.860
I need to see
Dr Miller right away.

16:05.375 --> 16:07.400
You've already seen him today,
haven't you? I think he's full up

16:07.487 --> 16:09.648
- for the rest of the day.
- Yeah. No, please, it's urgent.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.156
- What's the matter?
- Ah,

16:11.306 --> 16:13.866
my son wants to come
and see me, tomorrow.

16:13.954 --> 16:15.906
- Oh, that's great, Liz.
- Yeah. Yeah, except,

16:16.095 --> 16:18.557
Dr Miller's taken me off
my medication.

16:18.727 --> 16:21.008
- Why?
- Well, 'cos some arsehole

16:21.102 --> 16:23.923
dobbed him in to the
Medical Board, right?

16:24.540 --> 16:27.952
Well, what if the medication
was making you worse?

16:28.040 --> 16:29.266
No.

16:29.501 --> 16:32.337
No, it was making me better.
I know it was.

16:33.266 --> 16:37.516
This'll be the first time I've seen
Artie since I've come to prison.

16:38.352 --> 16:40.241
If I'm a mess in front of him,
it's just...

16:40.329 --> 16:41.593
it's gonna ruin everything.

16:41.681 --> 16:43.275
<i>Attention compound.

16:43.362 --> 16:45.079
D Block are now called
for lunch.

16:46.985 --> 16:49.155
Look, I want to help you, Liz,
I really do.

16:49.243 --> 16:50.709
But the Board is breathing down
my neck.

16:50.797 --> 16:53.678
My son is coming in
to visit me tomorrow.

16:53.806 --> 16:57.149
Now, I wrote to Artie
because my mind was clear,

16:57.251 --> 17:00.634
and that is thanks to
your pills, Dr Miller.

17:00.797 --> 17:04.685
Now, this is my last chance
to give my son

17:04.773 --> 17:08.796
some sort of explanation and
you can't take that away from me now.

17:08.884 --> 17:10.747
And it's not even
just about me.

17:10.873 --> 17:13.298
We are talking
about a possible cure

17:13.435 --> 17:15.851
- for friggin' dementia!
- Yes, I know.

17:16.021 --> 17:17.231
Well, do you?

17:17.920 --> 17:20.281
Do you really, really,

17:20.953 --> 17:22.663
wanna give that up?

17:50.592 --> 17:52.736
The only people
that can know about this

17:52.975 --> 17:55.545
- are you and me.
- Yep.

17:55.834 --> 17:57.991
And you have to come
here to get the pills, OK?

17:58.764 --> 18:01.686
Thank you so much.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.472
Come in.

18:06.302 --> 18:09.866
Connors has backed up Winter's story.
What'd the nurse say?

18:10.459 --> 18:12.950
Nothing.
She's done a runner.

18:13.491 --> 18:14.709
What?

18:14.803 --> 18:16.973
Well, the cops reviewed the CCTV.

18:17.061 --> 18:20.687
They've identified her as a criminal
with convictions for assault.

18:21.397 --> 18:25.170
They also found what could be a
hotshot under the bed in Medical.

18:25.474 --> 18:27.780
Seems pretty clear
she was there to kill Winter.

18:29.779 --> 18:32.795
So do you still think Marie
Winter's just a grieving mother?

18:41.999 --> 18:43.811
OK, you need to be straight
with me.

18:44.444 --> 18:46.606
I told you what happened.
The nurse attacked me.

18:46.694 --> 18:48.253
Why was she trying
to kill you, Marie?

18:49.389 --> 18:51.192
- They're trying to get rid of me?
- Who?

18:51.280 --> 18:54.136
- My competitors, on the outside.
- Yeah, but why?

18:54.819 --> 18:56.859
- They know you were sentenced to...
- I don't know.

19:01.233 --> 19:03.796
- You need to go into Protection.
- No. Please.

19:04.022 --> 19:07.647
Come on, what good am I
to you and the women in Protection?

19:08.607 --> 19:11.302
Besides, I feel safer
with my girls around.

19:11.624 --> 19:13.933
Please.

19:14.021 --> 19:15.641
Please.

19:16.892 --> 19:18.554
Hmm?

19:19.241 --> 19:20.481
Fine.

19:32.366 --> 19:34.775
I'll take Connors back
to her unit, thanks.

19:37.131 --> 19:39.174
I've just been speaking
to the hospital.

19:39.389 --> 19:43.053
- Ruby is being discharged tomorrow.
- Thanks.

19:45.927 --> 19:50.388
It seems that nurse was part
of a planned attack on Winter.

19:50.522 --> 19:51.886
Something's going on.

19:52.105 --> 19:54.764
I'd keep a close eye
on Marie if I was you.

19:55.357 --> 19:58.655
I reckon there's something going
on between her and Mr Jackson, too.

19:59.060 --> 20:02.215
- How do you mean?
- He kept coming to see her in the slot.

20:02.303 --> 20:05.614
Plus, Allie says he's been taking
her out of her unit a fair bit.

20:05.702 --> 20:07.858
Yeah, that's not unusual.
She is the Top Dog.

20:07.983 --> 20:09.561
In the middle of the night?

20:27.225 --> 20:30.749
Your plan failed,
arsehole. I'm still here.

20:31.224 --> 20:33.960
Now you listen to me
and you listen carefully.

20:34.069 --> 20:37.311
If you don't get me out of
here in the next 48 hours,

20:37.552 --> 20:39.012
the whole country's
going to find out

20:39.100 --> 20:41.039

to spend your holidays.

20:42.131 --> 20:43.952
Sick fuck.

20:52.936 --> 20:53.936
Fuck you, Marie!

20:54.420 --> 20:56.872
She's a shit fuckin' Top Dog,
anyway.

20:57.814 --> 21:00.840
- You're out, ya fuckin' cunt!
- You're fuckin' dead, Marie.

21:01.019 --> 21:03.470
- She'll get hers.
- You're fucked now!

21:03.558 --> 21:05.986
- Fuckin' trusted her.
- Yeah, she's shit.

21:06.074 --> 21:08.379
No, she's just all
about her fuckin' self.

21:08.613 --> 21:10.012
Scrag!

21:12.622 --> 21:14.105
It's OK.

21:16.065 --> 21:18.269
- You owe me.
- Yeah, I do.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.142
But you're not getting
my dirt file.

21:24.230 --> 21:26.808
I don't give a shit
about that. It's Ruby.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.257
Promise me
you'll leave her alone.

21:33.373 --> 21:35.218
OK, you got a deal.

21:36.405 --> 21:38.630
- But if I catch wind of any...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

21:38.718 --> 21:41.648

Rita, don't you worry.

21:45.619 --> 21:48.405

did you save that bitch's life?

a brain aneurysm, too?

23:03.613 --> 23:06.136
Maybe. Like, he couldn't
talk too good, could he?

23:06.230 --> 23:07.760
Oh, that's true. He was
sorta like that, wasn't he?

23:07.847 --> 23:09.658
- Yeah, he was like that.

26:40.892 --> 26:42.403

- Yeah.

26:43.705 --> 26:46.391

but if you stick it
out, you won't regret it.

26:48.603 --> 26:49.947
How do you know?

26:50.205 --> 26:54.799
Well, because your mum's

27:38.477 --> 27:40.604
Do you wanna come
and sit down?

27:42.466 --> 27:43.853
Sure.

27:52.546 --> 27:53.755
Hey, um,

27:54.218 --> 27:56.866
I'm so sorry
for treating you like shit.

27:59.283 --> 28:01.706
I only broke it off
because of Danny.

28:02.756 --> 28:06.110
I was scared you'd find out
and you'd tell Marie.

28:12.205 --> 28:14.855
I never stopped thinking
about you.

28:25.140 --> 28:26.878
What you said,

28:28.304 --> 28:30.960
it really made me think about

28:31.428 --> 28:33.453
how I need to be
with someone.

28:33.804 --> 28:37.077
Yeah, but being a bitch to you was
the only way I could deal with it.

28:37.218 --> 28:39.015
Yeah, but you were right.

28:40.420 --> 28:42.225
I do hate being alone.

28:43.358 --> 28:47.804
It's why I jump from one
relationship to the next.

28:48.426 --> 28:50.144
I want to be with you.

28:51.628 --> 28:55.525
But I don't want it to be
because I'm scared of being alone.

28:58.224 --> 29:00.291
Gotta sort that shit out.

29:04.913 --> 29:06.603
Well, I need someone to help me shower,

29:06.730 --> 29:08.603
so if you want the job, it's yours.

29:10.195 --> 29:14.109
Um... I think I can handle that.

29:22.603 --> 29:24.427
Me head hurts.

29:24.841 --> 29:26.935

You necked the whole bottle.

29:28.596 --> 29:30.317
- Hey.
- Hey, how'd you go?

29:30.405 --> 29:33.940
Oh, shit. I stuffed it up.

29:34.103 --> 29:36.804
Oh, why? What'd he say?

29:36.892 --> 29:38.986
Not much.
I didn't give him a chance.

29:39.180 --> 29:41.168
Oh, it's probably not
as bad as you think.

29:41.263 --> 29:43.005
What would you know?

29:43.761 --> 29:46.769
Um, he's gonna come back,
though, yeah?

29:47.402 --> 29:49.070
I don't think so, Booms.

29:49.450 --> 29:52.455
He could probably smell your
desperation. It's that bloody obvious.

29:52.542 --> 29:54.037
Look, why don't you shut up?

29:54.125 --> 29:57.394
The only thing that smells
around here is your breath.

30:05.238 --> 30:07.050
You nasty bitch!

30:07.138 --> 30:09.026
What the hell was that?
Hey!

30:09.226 --> 30:11.206
- What are you do... doing...
- You bloody cow!

30:11.293 --> 30:13.566
Stop it! Don't... don't do this!

30:13.653 --> 30:16.901
- May!
- Stop it! Don't! I didn't mean it!

30:17.371 --> 30:20.987
What the fuck are you doing? Stop it!

30:21.112 --> 30:23.523
Fuckin' get off the girl!

30:24.087 --> 30:25.544
Fuck!

30:26.267 --> 30:29.732
Who the fuck do you think
you are, you demented bitch?

30:30.374 --> 30:36.507
- On ya, Lizzie!
- You're a fuckin' bully.

30:36.632 --> 30:40.052
You hurt her again,
I'll hurt you!

30:40.139 --> 30:43.038
- Do you understand?
- You tell her!

30:43.938 --> 30:46.045
- On ya, Lizzie!
- Lay the boot in.

30:46.133 --> 30:48.671
On ya, Liz!

30:48.758 --> 30:51.296
You come here. Come
on. You come with me.

30:51.383 --> 30:55.121
Come with me.
You come with me.

30:56.780 --> 30:58.250
It's all right.

31:00.185 --> 31:03.319
Any mother
would be lucky to have you.

31:09.379 --> 31:13.671
- I wish you were my mum.
- Oh, sweetheart.

31:14.511 --> 31:16.212
Oh, sweetheart.

31:16.337 --> 31:20.624
- I do.
- Mmm. I can be your mum.

31:25.346 --> 31:27.281
<i>Attention compound.
Attention compound.</i>

31:27.369 --> 31:29.717
<i>Count will commence
in ten minutes.</i>

31:31.372 --> 31:33.916
Looks like your star's falling,
Top Dog.

31:34.221 --> 31:37.022
I'm gonna get me ringside
seats to the lynching.

31:38.143 --> 31:39.596
Winter.

31:41.266 --> 31:42.993
You're due in court
tomorrow.

31:43.222 --> 31:45.278
Your hearing's been
pushed forward.

31:45.443 --> 31:47.207
Be ready
to leave at 10:00.

31:56.784 --> 31:58.187
Suze!

32:00.038 --> 32:03.001
How's about you make
your ma a nice cuppa?

32:04.618 --> 32:05.797
Suze?

32:08.988 --> 32:10.625
Make it yourself.

32:40.572 --> 32:42.072
- Morning, ladies.
- Hey.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.336
Morning, Mr Stewart.
What's up?

32:44.605 --> 32:47.025
Artie'll be back in for
another visit today, Liz.

32:47.113 --> 32:49.244
- Oh!
- Oh, wow!

32:49.373 --> 32:52.454
- Well, that's great. Thank... thank you.
- No worries.

32:53.676 --> 32:56.741
- Ah! I knew he'd be back!
- Hey?

32:56.828 --> 32:58.566
Yeah, he's back!

32:58.749 --> 33:00.926
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

33:01.313 --> 33:04.999
I better think of something to talk
about this time, other than myself.

33:05.514 --> 33:07.857
What do teenage boys
talk about?

33:08.270 --> 33:11.508
- Oh, I don't know.
- Hey?

33:11.696 --> 33:14.480
- Ah, playing sport?
- Yeah.

33:14.737 --> 33:17.082
- Finger-banging chicks.
- Oh, yeah.

33:17.309 --> 33:18.323
Um...

33:18.411 --> 33:20.958
- Oh, right. Yeah.
- Don't stress.

33:21.046 --> 33:23.902
Right, just be yourself.

33:24.531 --> 33:26.614
- You're a great mum.
- Oh.

33:30.753 --> 33:33.063
When I saw you putting
that blanket over your mum,

33:33.151 --> 33:34.727
it reminded me of myself.

33:35.798 --> 33:37.681
Pissed as a fart.

33:39.012 --> 33:41.290
And Artie would do that
for me.

33:42.739 --> 33:44.204
Care for me.

33:44.869 --> 33:46.903
Even though
he was only a little fella.

33:49.508 --> 33:51.699
Did you belt him
with your shoe?

33:53.007 --> 33:54.399
No.

33:56.289 --> 33:59.165
Did ya hang shit on him
in front of other people,

33:59.253 --> 34:00.764
like, just for a laugh?

34:02.404 --> 34:05.929
No? Well, then I don't
reckon you gotta worry.

34:07.236 --> 34:10.739
'Cos you can do all that to a
kid and they'll still love ya.

34:12.257 --> 34:14.788
- Artie's back 'cos he loves you.
- Oh, lovey.

34:14.876 --> 34:17.150
No, I don't want to
hear any of that bullshit

34:17.237 --> 34:19.581
- about you not deserving it, all right?
- No.

34:19.763 --> 34:21.697
No, 'cos you do.

34:28.206 --> 34:29.697
Good luck, ya bitch.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.641
You better get out
of here while you can.

34:31.766 --> 34:33.712
You're not gonna look
so pretty now, bitch!

34:33.835 --> 34:37.498
- Don't come back!
- Shut up, you lot, or I'll slot you.

34:37.587 --> 34:40.181
- Get out!
- Be waiting for you.

34:54.136 --> 34:57.596
Hey! Oh, how are you?

34:57.989 --> 35:01.306
Oh, look at you! You look so good!

35:05.801 --> 35:07.258
Hey.

35:11.902 --> 35:14.261
I... I wasn't sure
you were coming back.

35:14.441 --> 35:16.861
I didn't make it easy
on you yesterday.

35:16.949 --> 35:18.355
Shit happens.

35:19.113 --> 35:20.597
Yeah, shit happens.

35:24.588 --> 35:26.996
You don't owe me
anything, Artie.

35:27.543 --> 35:31.175
If you don't want to see me,
it'd be hard, but I'll understand.

35:31.972 --> 35:34.377
Dad was pissed off when he
found out I'd been to see you.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.412
- Right.
- Told him it was my choice.

35:36.545 --> 35:38.334
Yeah, of course.

35:42.042 --> 35:44.924
I was thinking about what
you asked me yesterday, like,

35:45.857 --> 35:48.000
why I contacted you now.

35:48.510 --> 35:50.329
And it's true, I... I don't think

35:50.417 --> 35:52.362
prison's the best place
for kids, but...

35:53.924 --> 35:55.467
there's another reason.

35:58.777 --> 36:00.800
For a long time,

36:02.143 --> 36:06.104
I felt like
I didn't deserve to see

36:06.870 --> 36:10.401
you and Soph,
to be your mum,

36:11.659 --> 36:14.424
after everything
I put you both through.

36:16.206 --> 36:17.334
Sorry.

36:22.385 --> 36:24.495
I have a lot of
good memories.

36:25.073 --> 36:26.518
Me, too.

36:27.003 --> 36:28.651
Yeah, me too. Yeah.

36:31.112 --> 36:34.344
And I know we're sitting
here like two strangers

36:34.432 --> 36:38.651
and it feels really
bloody awkward, doesn't it?

36:39.577 --> 36:41.045
But I, uh...

36:42.323 --> 36:45.299
I'd love to learn a bit
about you.

36:57.112 --> 36:58.152
So,

36:58.987 --> 37:01.277
do you play sport?

37:02.768 --> 37:05.292
- Not really.
- Not really.

37:08.086 --> 37:10.493
Have you got anyone
special in your life?

37:12.346 --> 37:13.979
Have ya?

37:14.120 --> 37:15.588
You have!

37:17.680 --> 37:19.789
So, I've just been told

37:19.877 --> 37:22.401
that the police are dropping
the shoplifting charges.

37:22.581 --> 37:24.447
- Oh.
- They're satisfied that you weren't aware

37:24.534 --> 37:25.868
- of what was going on.
- Yeah.

37:25.956 --> 37:28.143
So you're still
on track for parole.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.455
Which is great news, isn't it?

37:33.499 --> 37:34.891
Yeah.

37:38.049 --> 37:39.458
I guess.

37:40.912 --> 37:42.635
What's the matter, Boomer?

37:46.993 --> 37:51.354
I've been wanting to get
out of here for so long.

37:52.266 --> 37:54.063
But, uh,

37:54.729 --> 37:57.338
everyone who gives a
shit about me is in here.

38:00.929 --> 38:02.419
Except for Mum.

38:14.499 --> 38:16.350
I need you to get out for a bit.

38:16.564 --> 38:19.033
- Why, what are you doing?
- It won't take long.

38:19.150 --> 38:22.432
If you keep quiet,
that 20K debt of yours,

38:22.596 --> 38:25.166
gone, by the end of the day.

39:03.158 --> 39:05.721
There's another officer
waiting down the road.

39:05.938 --> 39:07.962
We can take care of that.

39:10.771 --> 39:12.105
What about me?

39:13.093 --> 39:15.328
You know I'll take care of you,
Sean.

39:15.453 --> 39:17.437
You won't be
returning to Wentworth.

39:18.278 --> 39:21.109
Now close the door,
keep a watch outside.

39:47.819 --> 39:49.287
Hello, Marie.

39:49.538 --> 39:51.672
Come on. Out.

40:00.422 --> 40:02.382
I'm sorry it's come to this, but

40:02.593 --> 40:05.164
you've really boxed me
into a corner.

40:06.625 --> 40:09.523
Unlike you to do your
own dirty work, Michael.

40:09.797 --> 40:11.802
Yes, well, if you want
a job done properly,

40:11.890 --> 40:13.646
you best do it yourself.

40:13.734 --> 40:16.147
Painful, but true.

40:19.451 --> 40:22.090
I've sent my lawyer
a number of photos of you,

40:22.178 --> 40:24.308
and if I'm harmed in any way,

40:26.053 --> 40:29.444
he'll send those photos to
all the major news outlets.

40:31.241 --> 40:33.913
I guess you know how they
treat paedophiles in prison.

40:34.160 --> 40:37.475
Oh, your lawyer. Rodney.

40:42.185 --> 40:44.586
He won't be much use to you,
I'm afraid.

40:57.295 --> 41:00.412
He's not the only person
with a copy of those photos.

41:01.874 --> 41:03.537
You're bluffing.

41:06.321 --> 41:07.892
Try me.

41:20.951 --> 41:22.894
What took you so long?

41:23.811 --> 41:27.318
You wanna keep your kneecaps,
then here's my best tip yet:

41:27.529 --> 41:30.037
Keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

41:46.832 --> 41:49.068
Keep your shit together.

42:08.014 --> 42:11.290
- I'll take her back to her unit.
- No problem.

42:12.679 --> 42:15.513
Hey, I heard your hearing
was postponed. I'm sorry.

42:15.601 --> 42:18.733
Yeah, preparing for these
things brings everything up.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.565
Ok?

44:09.000 --> 44:10.608
Is Sean giving you
a hard time?

44:11.054 --> 44:12.335
I'm fine.

44:13.275 --> 44:15.063
I know what he's like.

44:16.652 --> 44:18.663
If you ever want to
talk about it, I'm here.

44:20.195 --> 44:21.601
Thanks, Jake.

44:48.389 --> 44:49.866
Suit yourself.

44:53.062 --> 44:54.768
What's going on?

44:55.460 --> 44:57.305
He's trying to pull some strings.

44:57.616 --> 44:59.183
I'll have an update for you soon.

44:59.270 --> 45:01.618
- Better be a good fuckin' update.
- Relax.

45:01.788 --> 45:03.515
He'll do what needs to be done.

45:03.783 --> 45:07.192
His career's the most important
thing to him, believe me.

45:08.584 --> 45:11.528
- What about Ms Miles?
- You don't have to worry about her.

45:11.748 --> 45:13.943
He must be paying you a lot of money.

45:14.116 --> 45:16.534
- What?
- For your help.

45:17.192 --> 45:20.182
- He's not paying me.
- Then why are you helping him?

45:21.135 --> 45:23.206
Because he's been good to me.

45:26.771 --> 45:28.784
He's been like a father.

45:30.837 --> 45:32.583
Is that what they call it?

45:43.144 --> 45:44.813
No, so that's Maddy.

45:44.900 --> 45:47.134
Yeah, they've been going
out for almost a year.

45:47.221 --> 45:49.508
- Oh, that's a long time when you're 17.
- I know.

45:49.595 --> 45:51.604
- Yeah, it's a long time, full stop.
- Yeah.

45:51.933 --> 45:53.455
Cute, Liz.

45:53.709 --> 45:56.856
Aw, so sweet.

45:56.944 --> 45:59.959
- Yeah, they are sweet, yeah.
- Oh.

46:00.584 --> 46:02.857
- I'd jump his bone.
- Oh!

46:02.944 --> 46:05.220
What? No, he's hot.

46:05.441 --> 46:06.962
You should be proud.

46:07.049 --> 46:12.295
I am ordering you to stay
away from my son. All right?

46:12.382 --> 46:14.103
Oh, no!

46:14.340 --> 46:17.820
- Stop it. Stop.
- Boomer, that's not even legal.

46:17.907 --> 46:19.434
Come on, we don't want
to see you back in here.

46:19.521 --> 46:22.170
Oh, when have
I cared about legal?

46:24.173 --> 46:26.709
- Hey, do you wanna...
- This is all your fault.

46:26.865 --> 46:28.738
You turned her against me.

46:28.927 --> 46:30.125
No.

46:30.770 --> 46:32.319
You did that yourself.

46:33.601 --> 46:36.661
Oh, look, love,
it'd be pretty rich of me to stand here

46:36.748 --> 46:38.849
and tell you how to
be the perfect mother.

46:38.937 --> 46:40.698
Yeah, bloody oath, mate.

46:42.124 --> 46:45.280
What I can say is you've got
a pretty unique opportunity

46:45.367 --> 46:47.364
having your daughter
in here with you.

46:49.829 --> 46:51.202
Don't waste it.

46:58.827 --> 47:01.991
OK, girls, give me
back me photo. Come on.
