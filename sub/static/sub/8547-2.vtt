Yeah, I'm just

No, that's not right.

all night, every night

01:56.038 --> 01:58.489
about this, and I know you guys deal
with it, and I'm not trying--

01:58.491 --> 02:00.791

I can't just let it happen.

02:00.793 --> 02:03.160

I have to go. I have--

02:03.162 --> 02:04.745
then you should.

You don't think I'm certifiable?
You're not mad at me?

02:07.633 --> 02:11.218
No. I'll have Kevin Lynch cover, and
you have a lot of vacation time.

02:11.220 --> 02:12.636
Thank you. Thank you.

02:12.638 --> 02:16.006
You are a terrific boss.

02:16.008 --> 02:17.341
You're a terrific boss.

02:17.343 --> 02:18.676
You're just terrific.

02:18.678 --> 02:20.678
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

02:23.683 --> 02:25.015
So, what'd he say?

02:25.017 --> 02:27.151
He said I should go
to Texas.

02:27.153 --> 02:28.686
Hotch would
never say that.

02:28.688 --> 02:31.689
OK. He said I have a lot
of vacation days,

02:31.691 --> 02:33.524
which is kind of
the same thing.

02:33.526 --> 02:35.859
He said you were crazy,
Garcia, didn't he?

02:35.861 --> 02:38.028
He didn't,
because I am not crazy.

02:38.030 --> 02:40.581
Going to see the man
who almost killed you and Reid

02:40.583 --> 02:41.865
is way beyond crazy.

02:41.867 --> 02:43.701
He needs to know
that I never meant

02:43.703 --> 02:45.736
for him to end up
on death row.

02:45.738 --> 02:47.588
Greg Baylor is a murderer.

02:47.590 --> 02:49.039
He's there for a reason.

02:49.041 --> 02:51.208
Then lock him up for life,
but killing him

02:51.210 --> 02:54.094
doesn't bring any of
the people that he killed back again,

02:54.096 --> 02:55.879
and it's bad karma
for everyone.

02:55.881 --> 02:57.715
I've done everything
I can think of.

02:57.717 --> 02:59.404
I wrote to the governor
on FBI stationery.

02:59.405 --> 03:00.405
I called him 3 times.

03:00.420 --> 03:01.988
You said you had a hook-up
with the prosecutor's office.

03:01.989 --> 03:03.270
Baby girl, he pled guilty,

03:03.272 --> 03:05.606
forfeiting a trial.
He waived all appeals

03:05.608 --> 03:07.408
and admitted to numerous
other killings.

03:07.410 --> 03:10.077
The governor
is setting an example.

03:10.079 --> 03:12.279
And Greg Baylor needs to know that
I never meant for this to happen.

03:12.281 --> 03:13.914
So send him a letter.

03:13.916 --> 03:17.785
I already did that.
I can't totally explain it,

03:17.787 --> 03:20.254
but I have to go and see him.

03:20.256 --> 03:23.318
Please, I can't talk to Sam about this.
You have to have my back.

03:23.319 --> 03:25.319
No. I don't have your back.

03:25.321 --> 03:28.356
He is a murderer.
He's scum.

03:28.358 --> 03:31.275

Wake up.

03:31.277 --> 03:34.945

done washing his feet.

03:42.121 --> 03:43.788

and Morgan?

03:43.790 --> 03:47.041

03:49.295 --> 03:51.212

some personal time.

03:51.214 --> 03:52.430

burritos we had yesterday.

will be presenting the case.

03:58.855 --> 03:59.855

03:59.856 --> 04:00.888
Where we going?

04:00.890 --> 04:02.306
Seattle, Washington.

04:02.308 --> 04:04.108
Over the past few weeks,

04:04.110 --> 04:06.560
two gentlemen between
the ages of 35 and 40

04:06.562 --> 04:09.196
have been killed, both with radically
different M.O.s.

04:09.198 --> 04:10.648
First victim, Dan Chen,

04:10.650 --> 04:12.900
was strangled and dropped
off on the side of a road.

04:12.902 --> 04:16.786
The second victim, Joe Hazley,
was run over by a car.

04:16.789 --> 04:19.707
The intimacy of strangulation
suggests a personal attack,

04:19.709 --> 04:22.626
literally and figuratively,
the need to kill in a hands-on manner.

04:22.628 --> 04:24.128
While crushing someone
with a car

04:24.130 --> 04:26.130
presents as distance
and removal from the kill.

04:26.132 --> 04:27.581
What makes you think
they're connected?

04:27.583 --> 04:29.750
The victims' cars were found about
two miles from each other,

04:29.752 --> 04:31.969
and they have similar
mutilation around their mouths.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.304
And he crosses
racial lines.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.723
Well, if you consider that
and a similar Geo-profile,

04:35.725 --> 04:38.058
maybe we have
two different killers.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.677
We could be looking
at a team.

04:39.679 --> 04:40.845
A disorganized one.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.146
Or the unsub's
just experimenting,

04:42.148 --> 04:43.814
trying to figure out
how he or she likes to kill.

04:43.816 --> 04:44.982
Similar to Herzog
and Shermantine.

04:44.984 --> 04:46.317
So we need to get
to Seattle quickly.

04:46.319 --> 04:49.770

he could strike again soon.

and legs were bound

on their heads.

attacks them or hits them

10:04.256 --> 10:06.806
Nothing out of
the ordinary in their systems.

10:06.808 --> 10:08.658
However, I did find
some slash marks

10:08.660 --> 10:10.170
on the roofs
of their mouths.

10:10.194 --> 10:12.194
Slash marks--
We thought it was random mutliation.

10:20.772 --> 10:22.021
Whoa.

10:22.023 --> 10:24.657
What is it?

10:24.659 --> 10:25.992
It's not slashes.
It look--

10:25.994 --> 10:28.027
it looks like Roman
numerals.

10:28.029 --> 10:29.029
What?

10:29.030 --> 10:30.530
Look.

10:32.284 --> 10:34.284
It's the number 3.

10:34.285 --> 10:37.386
Joe Hazley's body's
downstairs.

10:37.389 --> 10:38.705
We'll need to see it.

10:38.707 --> 10:40.173
Reid, what about this guy?

10:48.834 --> 10:50.967
It looks like
Roman numeral 5.

10:50.969 --> 10:54.137
So then we may not be
looking at victims 1, 2, and 3.

10:54.139 --> 10:56.856
We're probably looking
at 3, 4, and 5.

10:56.858 --> 10:59.025
Which means there are
two more bodies out there.

10:59.027 --> 11:02.061
I'll have Kevin look into
past homicides in the area,

11:02.063 --> 11:04.814

11:21.333 --> 11:24.551
They ran him over
in a car?

11:24.553 --> 11:28.054
A car? Who would do that?
Why Joe?

11:28.056 --> 11:30.423
Does your brother
have any enemies?

11:30.425 --> 11:31.808
Not at all.

11:31.810 --> 11:36.679
OK, um, has he had
any run-ins with colleagues or exes?

11:36.681 --> 11:38.181
Joe wasn't like that.

11:38.183 --> 11:40.984
He was a mediator,
you know?

11:40.986 --> 11:45.521
The guy at the party who makes
sure everyone's having fun.

11:45.523 --> 11:50.326
If you needed $10,
he'd give you 20.

11:50.328 --> 11:54.280
Even with his little brother from
that program, he treated him like blood.

11:54.282 --> 11:56.916
So he volunteered
as a big brother?

11:56.918 --> 11:58.017
Yes.

11:58.019 --> 12:01.537
He could be tough on Jose.

12:01.539 --> 12:05.124
But that kid went
from getting Cs to As thanks to Joe.

12:05.126 --> 12:06.693
How old is Jose?

12:06.695 --> 12:09.762
14.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.350
When he finds out
what happened,

12:14.352 --> 12:16.302
it's gonna kill him.

12:19.391 --> 12:20.640
You get anything?

12:20.642 --> 12:22.892
No enemies.
Seemed loved.

12:22.894 --> 12:24.277
Yeah, same with Dan Chandler.

12:24.279 --> 12:26.479
His wife said he was
a good father to the twin 13-year-olds.

12:26.481 --> 12:27.814
The boys said he was tough
but fair.

12:27.816 --> 12:29.866
That could be
our connection.

12:29.867 --> 12:32.451
Joe Hazley was mentoring
a kid the same age

12:32.454 --> 12:34.237
who he was also tough on.

12:34.239 --> 12:36.239
Mike Richmond had a son
about the same age, too.

12:36.241 --> 12:38.374
They had an argument
about an hour before he went missing.

12:38.376 --> 12:41.411
Maybe our unsub has something against
strict paternal figures

12:41.413 --> 12:43.129
with boys in that age group.

Greg Baylor.

12:53.091 --> 12:55.141
You're not on the list.
Next.

12:55.143 --> 12:57.093
Wait, no.
I'm from the FBI.

12:57.095 --> 12:58.478
I left a message.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.680
Oh, yeah. That Garcia.

13:00.682 --> 13:02.899
He said he didn't
want to see you.

13:02.901 --> 13:03.933
Next.

13:03.935 --> 13:06.586
No! Uh, I came here
all the way from Quantico.

13:06.588 --> 13:07.770
He can't just
not want to see me.

13:07.772 --> 13:08.988
I have something
I have to tell him.

13:08.990 --> 13:10.823
[Whispering]
He's on death row.

13:10.825 --> 13:12.742
I understand where he is,

13:12.744 --> 13:14.610
and I also understand
the Constitution.

13:14.612 --> 13:16.446
And Mr. Baylor
still has rights,

13:16.448 --> 13:18.998
which he has decided
to exercise.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Next.

13:20.001 --> 13:20.950
OK, OK.

13:20.952 --> 13:22.669
Uh...Can I
leave him a note?

13:22.671 --> 13:23.836
You can try.

13:23.838 --> 13:25.038
Can I borrow your pen?

13:25.040 --> 13:26.339
Over there.

13:26.341 --> 13:28.291
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

13:28.293 --> 13:30.376
Next!

13:32.097 --> 13:35.465
So, this is where Mike
Richmond was abducted.

13:35.467 --> 13:37.133
This road is highly
trafficked,

13:37.135 --> 13:39.469
but this stretch
seems pretty empty.

13:39.471 --> 13:41.270
Our unsub probably
followed him.

13:41.272 --> 13:43.639
Yes, so how did he lure them out
of their vehicles,

13:43.641 --> 13:46.809
'cause they'd be
on alert out here.

13:46.811 --> 13:49.645
He bumps them as they
cross the intersection,

13:49.647 --> 13:52.365
then they pull over,
thinking they were in an accident.

13:52.367 --> 13:53.983
Like a bump and rob.

13:53.985 --> 13:56.319
But this turned into
a bump and abduct.

13:56.321 --> 13:57.820
You know, I had
a rapist once

13:57.822 --> 13:59.806
who liked to bump and rape
right there on the side of the road.

13:59.808 --> 14:01.491
And no one saw?

14:01.493 --> 14:02.992
No, if they did,
they kept going.

14:02.994 --> 14:05.078
I'm convinced most people
don't pay attention these days.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.647
If it doesn't happen
on the phone, it doesn't exist.

14:16.057 --> 14:17.807
Why don't you
answer that?

14:17.809 --> 14:20.059
It's Garcia. I don't know
what to tell her, Reid.

14:20.061 --> 14:23.679
She's gone to see Greg Baylor
before he gets executed.

14:23.681 --> 14:25.348
Go figure.

14:25.350 --> 14:26.849
It's PTSD.

14:26.851 --> 14:29.519
Her nightmares
are PTSD, Reid.

14:29.521 --> 14:31.270
She's taken this
to a whole nother level.

14:31.272 --> 14:34.023
You know Garcia.
She carries a laptop, not a gun.

14:34.025 --> 14:35.992
She can't even look
at crime scene photos

14:35.994 --> 14:39.195
without needing pictures
of panda bears to counterbalance them.

14:39.197 --> 14:40.663
I tried to walk her back
from the ledge,

14:40.665 --> 14:42.331
but I think she's
already jumped.

14:42.333 --> 14:44.367
I was like that
after I shot the LDSK.

14:45.870 --> 14:47.870
Yeah. At first
I felt nothing.

14:47.872 --> 14:51.207
And then--
Gideon was right. It just hit me.

14:51.209 --> 14:53.042
I started to obsess.

14:53.044 --> 14:54.710
Looked up photos of him
when he was in the Rangers.

14:54.712 --> 14:57.180
I studied cases he worked
when he was a cop.

14:57.182 --> 14:59.799
I--even patients he treated
while he was a nurse.

14:59.801 --> 15:01.050
Why?

15:01.052 --> 15:03.686
I just wanted
to get inside of him.

15:03.688 --> 15:06.722
And I wanted to try
to understand why our paths crossed

15:06.724 --> 15:09.809
and see if there was some way
that he could have been stopped

15:09.811 --> 15:11.110
before I came along.

15:11.112 --> 15:12.645
What made you finally
move on?

15:12.647 --> 15:14.564
All the people he killed.

15:14.566 --> 15:16.616
I put their photos
on my wall.

15:16.618 --> 15:18.901
They had lives, too.

15:19.821 --> 15:22.071
If this guy followed
our victims

15:22.073 --> 15:24.574
and used a ruse,
then he's not just acting on impulse.

15:24.576 --> 15:25.825
Hotch: No, it's

15:25.827 --> 15:28.461

Roman numerals

of their mouths,

which is highly symbolic.

15:32.333 --> 15:33.466

make any sense.

19:24.687 --> 19:28.205
Because he's probably
in the sixth circle.

19:28.207 --> 19:29.807
Circle of what?

19:29.808 --> 19:31.107
Dan Chen was found
in the mud.

19:31.110 --> 19:32.443
The other guy
was crushed to death.

19:32.445 --> 19:34.278
I don't think
these are random M.O.s.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.697
The unsub is recreating
the circles of hell.

19:36.699 --> 19:39.650
Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.

19:39.652 --> 19:41.652
Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.

19:41.654 --> 19:44.288
Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.

19:44.290 --> 19:47.041
Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.

19:47.043 --> 19:48.959
Abandon all hope.

19:48.961 --> 19:50.995
Hotch: We believe the unsub
we're looking for is a male

19:50.997 --> 19:53.214
between the ages
of 35 and 40

19:53.216 --> 19:54.882
who is killing
parental figures

19:54.884 --> 19:56.917
based on his need
for revenge and punishment.

19:56.919 --> 20:00.421
He's designed his M.O.
to recreate Dante's 9 circles of hell.

20:00.423 --> 20:03.507
Rossi: "The Inferno" is the first part
of  Dante's "divine comedy,"

20:03.509 --> 20:06.227
within it, he describes
the sinners he'd encounter

20:06.229 --> 20:07.645
in each circle of hell

20:07.647 --> 20:09.680
and the punishments
they'd endured.

20:09.682 --> 20:12.266
The first circle
was for those who didn't accept God,

20:12.268 --> 20:16.353
therefore lived in limbo, punished
by a blinding fog.

20:16.355 --> 20:19.356
The first victim was found gassed
in his apartment.

20:19.358 --> 20:22.493
The second circle
was for those guilty of lust,

20:22.495 --> 20:26.113
who'd be blown around
in a violent storm.

20:27.033 --> 20:28.999
Oh, no! Please...

20:29.001 --> 20:31.752
Therefore, our second
victim was tied to a fence

20:31.754 --> 20:33.337
and electrocuted.

20:33.339 --> 20:34.955
The third circle
was gluttony,

20:34.957 --> 20:38.042
where sinners would be rained on
and wallow in mud.

20:38.044 --> 20:40.177
Our next victim was found strangled
on the side of the road

20:40.179 --> 20:41.462
covered with dirt.

20:41.464 --> 20:43.464
Reid: Our fourth victim
was crushed like the punishment

20:43.466 --> 20:45.382
in the next circle
reserved for greed.

20:45.384 --> 20:46.850
The fifth circle is wrath,

20:46.852 --> 20:49.136
where sinners were drowned
in swampy water,

20:49.138 --> 20:51.355
which is exactly
what happened to the next victim.

20:51.357 --> 20:54.725
In the sixth, heretics were trapped
in a burning tomb,

20:54.727 --> 20:56.393
like our most recent
victim,

20:56.395 --> 20:58.362
and the next 3 circles
are just as vicious.

20:58.364 --> 21:01.732
Our unsub killed all the way through
the sixth circle

21:01.734 --> 21:03.233
and marked his victims
accordingly.

21:03.235 --> 21:05.286
But his victims hadn't
committed the sins

21:05.288 --> 21:06.453
associated
with each ring,

21:06.455 --> 21:07.621
which suggests
that the killings

21:07.623 --> 21:08.956
are symbolic of
the father figure

21:08.958 --> 21:10.124
who hurt him
in the past.

21:10.126 --> 21:12.960
In the poem, Dante traveled
with the poet Virgil

21:12.962 --> 21:14.578
who assured him
he would enter paradise

21:14.580 --> 21:15.963
if he completed his journey.

21:15.965 --> 21:17.581
Consequently,
we believe our unsub

21:17.583 --> 21:20.084
is metaphorically taking this journey
with someone else.

21:20.086 --> 21:21.385
Man:
I will help you.

21:21.387 --> 21:23.637
I will help you.
I will help you.

21:23.639 --> 21:25.756
His Virgil is most likely
a sibling

21:25.758 --> 21:27.141
that suffered the same fate

21:27.143 --> 21:28.676
at the hand
of an abusive father.

21:28.678 --> 21:32.062
This man's patient.
We also think he's an academic.

21:32.064 --> 21:35.265
He stalks his victims, and after
watching them discipline a child,

21:35.267 --> 21:36.817
he waits until
what he considers

21:36.819 --> 21:38.919
the appropriate moment
to kill them.

21:38.921 --> 21:41.322
We believe he will continue
with the final 3 circles

21:41.324 --> 21:43.157
until he feels
completely avenged.

21:43.159 --> 21:45.326
4 cavities. Do you know
how much that cost me?

21:45.328 --> 21:46.860
I've been brushing
my teeth.

21:46.862 --> 21:48.162
Bull!

21:48.164 --> 21:50.614
All you do is eat candy
and play video games.

21:50.616 --> 21:52.082
You're grounded
for two weeks

21:52.084 --> 21:54.585
and you're not going
to the ballgame on Saturday.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.008
Where are we?

22:01.010 --> 22:02.626
The victims' automobiles
were found right here.

22:02.628 --> 22:04.378
And that is where
all the victims were last seen

22:04.380 --> 22:05.462
prior to the abductions.

22:05.464 --> 22:06.797
So he's able to move
around freely.

22:06.799 --> 22:08.298
All right, we need
to get back to the poem.

22:08.300 --> 22:10.134
An unsub this committed
to a body of work

22:10.136 --> 22:11.552
isn't killing
out of the blue.

22:11.554 --> 22:13.604
Maybe he'd obsess
over the poem,

22:13.606 --> 22:15.305
maybe even write about it
before acting it out.

22:15.307 --> 22:16.640
Morgan:
Create a manifesto?

22:16.642 --> 22:19.309
Yeah. At least be literary enough
to post his thoughts.

22:19.311 --> 22:21.362
Kevin, what did you
come up with

22:21.364 --> 22:23.814
on people posting online rants about
Dante's "Inferno"?

22:23.816 --> 22:26.266
There are over 80 people
in the past week.

22:26.268 --> 22:27.951
Rossi: Subtract
high school kids.

22:27.953 --> 22:30.821
We're not looking for
screeds about homework.

22:30.823 --> 22:32.823
You got 5 in the state,
my friend.

22:32.825 --> 22:34.475
Any in the comfort zone?

22:34.477 --> 22:35.826
One.

22:35.828 --> 22:36.994
What's his name?

22:36.996 --> 22:39.463
Nathan Chow. He's a student
at Puget College.

22:39.465 --> 22:41.715
He posted a blog
about killing people at his school

22:41.717 --> 22:43.600
using Dante's 9 circles
of hell.

22:43.602 --> 22:45.252
When did he do it?

22:45.254 --> 22:46.720
A week before the first murder.

22:46.722 --> 22:48.088
He's a little younger
than our profile.

22:48.090 --> 22:49.556
What if he's our Virgil?

22:49.558 --> 22:51.675
We catch him,
we catch our unsub.

22:51.677 --> 22:53.510
Send us the address.

24:02.098 --> 24:04.749
Nathan Chow, FBI!

24:08.721 --> 24:10.554
1, 2.

24:12.975 --> 24:14.975
Clear.

24:28.691 --> 24:30.657
Explosives?

24:30.659 --> 24:32.609
That's not circle 7.

24:32.611 --> 24:34.945
No, but suicide is one of
the inner circles of 7.

24:34.947 --> 24:37.831
This could be the endgame.

24:37.833 --> 24:39.366
Nathan?

24:46.008 --> 24:48.759
You're under arrest.

24:48.761 --> 24:50.093
You have the right
to remain silent.

24:50.095 --> 24:52.262
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

24:52.264 --> 24:54.131
in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney...

24:54.133 --> 24:56.967
And have him present
while you're being questioned.

24:58.771 --> 25:01.305
[Bell rings]

25:13.452 --> 25:16.003
Thank you for agreeing
to see me.

25:18.023 --> 25:20.324
How are you?
That's a dumb question.

25:20.326 --> 25:21.491
You look good.
I mean, you look good

25:21.493 --> 25:22.659
especially considering--

25:22.661 --> 25:25.696
is this place
as bad as it seems?

25:25.698 --> 25:27.898
It could use some paint.

25:29.051 --> 25:32.553
I'm nervous.
I can't stop talking. I'm sorry.

25:32.555 --> 25:35.622
Look, I know
you got my letter.

25:35.624 --> 25:37.758
And I know you tried
to hurt me and my friend,

25:37.760 --> 25:40.310
but I need you to know
I never meant for this to happen,

25:40.312 --> 25:41.845
for you to end up
on death row.

25:41.847 --> 25:43.213
I tried to stop this.

25:43.215 --> 25:45.515
You tried to stop this?

25:45.517 --> 25:47.017
Yes. I called the governor.

25:47.019 --> 25:48.602
I wrote him a letter.

25:48.604 --> 25:50.671
You had a horrible upbringing.
This isn't you.

25:50.673 --> 25:53.257
Why are you really here?

25:53.259 --> 25:55.525
I need you to know
I'm in your corner.

25:55.527 --> 25:58.862
Oh. You're not here
for me.

25:58.864 --> 26:00.897
You're here
for yourself.

26:00.899 --> 26:04.251
That's not entirely true.

26:04.253 --> 26:06.019
Of course it is.
You don't know me.

26:06.021 --> 26:07.354
Oh, I know you.

26:07.356 --> 26:08.555
Trust me.

26:08.557 --> 26:10.474
Oh, so you want me
to forgive you.

26:10.476 --> 26:11.441
No.

26:11.443 --> 26:12.542
You want me to say
I'm a bad man,

26:12.544 --> 26:14.144
I love killing,
I deserve this?

26:14.146 --> 26:15.262
No.

26:15.264 --> 26:16.913
Then what the hell
is it?

26:16.915 --> 26:18.966
Huh?
'Cause I'm done talking.

26:18.968 --> 26:21.051
I'm done feeling guilty.

26:21.053 --> 26:22.552
I got 10 hours
left to breathe,

26:22.554 --> 26:24.771
and the last thing I need is some freaky
woman coming up here

26:24.773 --> 26:28.475
with her liberal guilt
trying to change things.

26:28.477 --> 26:30.644
I'm a killer.

26:30.646 --> 26:33.497
You can't change that.

26:35.901 --> 26:37.651
I did it.

26:37.653 --> 26:39.119
I killed them.

26:39.122 --> 26:40.071
JJ: All 6 of them?

26:40.072 --> 26:43.740
Yes. Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.

26:43.742 --> 26:46.076
Morgan: Dante had that much
of an effect on you, huh?

26:46.078 --> 26:48.195
You figured by taking
your victims through hell,

26:48.197 --> 26:49.596
you'd relieve
some kind of pain.

26:49.598 --> 26:53.200
Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.

26:53.202 --> 26:55.502
How did you choose
the 6 victims?

26:55.504 --> 26:58.138
Were they random,
or did they have meaning to you?

26:58.140 --> 26:59.990
Evil isn't random.

26:59.992 --> 27:01.308
It's quite precise.

27:01.310 --> 27:04.594
You made a list
and started killing.

27:04.596 --> 27:05.662
No.

27:05.664 --> 27:08.315
They chose their fates.

27:08.317 --> 27:10.267
We're all evil.

27:10.269 --> 27:13.103
Men and women.

27:13.105 --> 27:16.440
Evil doesn't discriminate.

27:16.442 --> 27:19.242
So let's enter through
the gates of hell

27:19.244 --> 27:21.945
and talk about
the first killing.

27:21.947 --> 27:24.281
You replicated
the first circle?

27:24.283 --> 27:28.452
I put her in a fog
and I strangled her.

27:28.454 --> 27:30.871
Actually, you chained him
in his apartment

27:30.873 --> 27:32.589
and left the oven on.

27:32.591 --> 27:35.258
All the victims
were male, Nathan.

27:35.260 --> 27:36.912
Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.

27:36.913 --> 27:38.959
Nathan, we know you're
working with someone.

27:38.983 --> 27:40.298
Who are you protecting?

27:40.299 --> 27:41.498
...ye who enter here.

27:41.500 --> 27:44.685
Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.

27:44.687 --> 27:47.104
Nathan,
stop stonewalling us.

27:47.106 --> 27:49.139
You're his Virgil,
aren't you?

27:49.141 --> 27:51.858
No. I'm Dante.

27:51.860 --> 27:54.144
I'm Dante.

27:54.146 --> 27:59.783
Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.

27:59.785 --> 28:03.820
OK, why is he taking credit for killings
he clearly didn't do?

28:03.822 --> 28:05.372
Ego, maybe.

28:05.374 --> 28:07.240
In the poem, Dante
and Virgil had roles

28:07.242 --> 28:08.825
from which
they didn't stray.

28:08.827 --> 28:11.128
This unsub and his Virgil
would do the same thing.

28:11.130 --> 28:12.496
Rossi:
So who's this kid?

28:12.498 --> 28:13.964
I don't know.
He's got some relationship

28:13.966 --> 28:15.415
with the unsub.

28:15.417 --> 28:18.502
Guys, with circles 7, 8, and 9 left,
we're running out of time.

28:18.504 --> 28:21.755
We need to dig more deeply
into Nathan's life.

28:21.757 --> 28:25.058
I think we're getting off
to an icky start.

28:25.060 --> 28:26.793
I'm done.
You should go.

28:26.795 --> 28:27.761
But--

28:27.763 --> 28:29.679
There's nothing
that you can say.

28:29.681 --> 28:31.615
Then why did you agree
to see me?

28:31.617 --> 28:35.902
I'm not a friend.
I'm not family.

28:37.306 --> 28:39.473
Oh, is that it?

28:39.475 --> 28:41.875
They didn't come?

28:41.877 --> 28:44.895
I'm the only one
who showed up?

28:44.897 --> 28:46.329
Shut up.

28:46.331 --> 28:48.965
If I was wrong, you would have called
the guard over here by now.

28:48.967 --> 28:51.535
You're afraid.

28:51.537 --> 28:54.788
As tough as you're acting
right now,

28:54.790 --> 28:57.674
this is the scariest.

28:57.676 --> 29:00.093
And you don't want to die.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.764
I deserve this.

29:03.766 --> 29:06.199
Why the heck
did you call me?

29:15.394 --> 29:18.562
Because I don't want
to die alone.

29:23.135 --> 29:25.001
Oh.

29:26.822 --> 29:28.288
I can't.

29:28.290 --> 29:30.457
Why?

29:30.459 --> 29:32.075
For a lot of reasons.

29:32.077 --> 29:34.377
I--I--I--I hate--

29:34.379 --> 29:36.463
I hate--I don't like blood.

29:36.465 --> 29:37.597
It's an injection.

29:37.599 --> 29:41.251
There's gotta be someone
out there--

29:41.253 --> 29:43.603
No, you were right.
I got nobody.

29:43.605 --> 29:48.124
Nobody came to visit me.
Nobody called.

29:48.126 --> 29:51.478
You're the only human
that reached out to me,

29:51.480 --> 29:53.063
in the letter.

29:53.065 --> 29:57.017
Well, maybe the governor
will still grant you a stay.

29:57.019 --> 29:59.402
But if he doesn't...

29:59.404 --> 30:02.989
Then I want somebody there.

30:02.991 --> 30:04.708
I'm scared.

30:06.829 --> 30:08.778
I don't know.

30:08.780 --> 30:12.199
Then I was right.

30:12.201 --> 30:13.834
You're not here for me.

30:13.836 --> 30:15.452
You're here for yourself.

30:15.454 --> 30:16.419
Hey.

30:16.421 --> 30:19.673
No. No.
No, wait.

30:19.675 --> 30:20.624
Take me back.

30:20.626 --> 30:21.675
Wait, Greg.
I'm done.

30:21.677 --> 30:22.677
Greg.

30:22.678 --> 30:24.294
No--Greg--

30:24.296 --> 30:26.129
no, Greg, wait.

30:26.131 --> 30:27.131
Greg.

30:27.132 --> 30:29.049
I didn't mean...

30:29.051 --> 30:30.851
Could we...

30:30.853 --> 30:32.602
Greg.

30:32.604 --> 30:34.638
Greg.

30:36.341 --> 30:38.975
No one in Nathan's life
fits the profile.

30:38.977 --> 30:41.228
Kate: Did you check people
in his high school classes?

30:41.230 --> 30:43.230
Yeah. Still coming up empty.

30:43.233 --> 30:45.149
All right, I've got
Nathan's copy of "The Inferno"

30:45.150 --> 30:48.652
with detailed notes,
but the edition is from 1986.

30:48.654 --> 30:50.320
And if Nathan was in high school
two years ago,

30:50.322 --> 30:51.872
he would have had
a more recent edition.

30:51.874 --> 30:54.491
Is they a J. Leu
anywhere in Nathan's life?

30:54.493 --> 30:57.210
Uh, yeah.
There's a Justin Leu.

30:57.212 --> 30:59.829
He was Nathan's high school
AP English teacher.

30:59.831 --> 31:02.582
If you give a kid
an early edition of a book,

31:02.584 --> 31:04.251
it's because you had a bond.

31:04.253 --> 31:05.886
Oh, in Nathan's digital
yearbook,

31:05.888 --> 31:07.470
he says that Mr. Leu
was the only reason

31:07.472 --> 31:08.838
he got through
high school.

31:08.840 --> 31:10.173
He took his class twice.

31:10.175 --> 31:11.992
Is Mr. Leu still
in the school system?

31:11.994 --> 31:13.677
Yeah, he's been there
for years.

31:13.679 --> 31:16.179
From the looks of it,
he's a very tough teacher.

31:16.181 --> 31:17.564
[Bell rings]

31:17.566 --> 31:20.016
Oh, and please remember
your "Paradise Lost" papers

31:20.018 --> 31:21.351
are due next Friday.

31:21.353 --> 31:23.770
Don't forget. Thank you.

31:26.108 --> 31:28.525
Mr. Leu...

31:28.527 --> 31:29.910
You can't give me a "B".

31:29.912 --> 31:31.494
Well, that's what you got.

31:31.496 --> 31:34.247
If I come home with a "B,"
my dad's gonna kill me.

31:34.249 --> 31:36.833
Voices: Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.

31:36.835 --> 31:41.338
Abandon all hope,

31:41.340 --> 31:43.373
Hotch: What do we know
about Leu's family?

31:43.375 --> 31:46.126
Kevin: The mom passed away
of cancer when Justin was 10.

31:46.128 --> 31:47.711
Father started spiraling.

31:47.713 --> 31:50.547
Father:
Let me see, Justin.

31:50.549 --> 31:52.048
You got a "B"?

31:52.050 --> 31:54.718
Todd, what did you get?

31:59.057 --> 32:00.690
A B-minus.

32:00.692 --> 32:02.108
How many hours
did you study?

32:02.110 --> 32:03.059
Justin: Dad...

32:03.061 --> 32:05.061
You don't deserve
to eat or sleep.

32:05.063 --> 32:06.063
But, Dad--

32:06.064 --> 32:07.447
shut up!

32:07.449 --> 32:09.149
Kevin: Stopped going
to church, started drinking.

32:09.151 --> 32:10.617
He was very abusive.

32:10.619 --> 32:13.903
Social services said
he often locked the kids in a shed.

32:13.905 --> 32:16.523
Was the father violent
with both boys?

32:16.525 --> 32:18.575
Yes, but according to
Child Protective Services,

32:18.577 --> 32:22.462
Mr. Leu's older brother Todd
got the worst of it.

32:25.300 --> 32:27.417
Justin,
you shouldn't be here.

32:27.419 --> 32:30.086
It's going to be OK.
It's going to be OK.

32:30.088 --> 32:32.505

Abandon all hope...

Abandon all hope,

32:37.312 --> 32:38.678
And where's
the brother now?

32:38.680 --> 32:40.263
Todd?

32:41.433 --> 32:44.234
Todd.

32:44.236 --> 32:45.318
Todd!

32:45.320 --> 32:46.820
Todd!

32:46.822 --> 32:48.605
Todd!

32:48.607 --> 32:50.190
Kevin: He committed suicide.

32:50.192 --> 32:51.491
Dad!

32:51.493 --> 32:53.159
Reid: So that's who
his Virgil is, his brother.

32:53.161 --> 32:54.661
He's metaphorically going
on this journey with him.

32:54.663 --> 32:56.329
Hotch: Maybe the father
committed the sins

32:56.331 --> 32:58.164

the 9 circles.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.623
An "A"?

33:06.625 --> 33:08.541
Are you serious?

33:08.543 --> 33:10.427
Thanks.

33:10.429 --> 33:12.579
Rossi: Is the father
still alive?

33:12.581 --> 33:14.948
No, he passed away
a couple months ago.

33:14.950 --> 33:17.183
Justin inherited his house.

33:17.185 --> 33:18.718
That's what triggered
the killing.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.353
All right, Kevin, send us
the school address, the home address,

33:20.355 --> 33:22.389
And his father's address.
Sent.

this is painful?

Wait till you get to hell.

34:07.436 --> 34:09.069
Aah!

34:21.333 --> 34:23.333
Un huh. OK, thanks.

34:23.335 --> 34:25.585
Hotch and Rossi just left the school.
Justin's not there.

34:25.588 --> 34:26.920
What about
at his apartment?

34:26.922 --> 34:28.339
It's empty, too.
He has to be headed

34:28.341 --> 34:29.956
to his father's house.

34:29.958 --> 34:32.827
Please,
I'll do whatever you want.

34:32.829 --> 34:34.545
I just want you
to be nice.

34:46.359 --> 34:47.775
Shut up.

34:47.777 --> 34:49.893

are lazy.

34:49.896 --> 34:51.612
No, be quiet.

34:51.614 --> 34:54.197
You should have both
died back then.

Please, help me!

35:07.797 --> 35:10.715
Killing him's
not gonna help you.

35:10.717 --> 35:12.917
I need to finish
this journey.

35:12.919 --> 35:14.585
But you skipped
number 7

35:14.587 --> 35:16.587
and went right
to 8, Justin.

35:16.589 --> 35:18.673
Part of 7 was suicide.

35:18.675 --> 35:20.007
You were gonna try to
complete the circles

35:20.009 --> 35:21.726
and save that
for yourself.

35:21.728 --> 35:22.677
You don't know me.

35:22.679 --> 35:24.011
You thought that
by killing yourself

35:24.013 --> 35:26.147
it would even the score.

35:26.149 --> 35:27.765
But your brother
didn't commit suicide

35:27.767 --> 35:29.650
because he couldn't
live up to your grades, Justin.

35:29.652 --> 35:31.436
He was depressed.

35:31.438 --> 35:33.438
No. It's my fault.

35:33.440 --> 35:34.739
It's my fault!

35:34.741 --> 35:36.240
It was your father's.

35:36.242 --> 35:38.609
If he'd have gotten your brother
the help he needed,

35:38.611 --> 35:40.411
none of this
would have happened.
