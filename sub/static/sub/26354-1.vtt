18.

00:23.128 --> 00:25.039
Louise, that's plenty
of sugar in your oatmeal.

00:25.116 --> 00:26.793
My body, my rules, Father.

00:26.870 --> 00:29.364
- I'm crumbling bacon in mine.
- Gene, stop it.

00:29.441 --> 00:31.403
Wait. Is that good?
Give-give me some bacon.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.129
Ooh, fun oatmeal mix-ups.

00:33.206 --> 00:34.362
- Ow.
- Bacon block!

00:34.439 --> 00:36.067
Wait. Here's the Boyz 4 Now story.

00:36.144 --> 00:37.735
- Zip your B-holes.
- B-holes?

00:37.812 --> 00:39.484
- Breakfast holes. Shh.
- Oh.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.240
<i>This is Olsen Benner, reporting</i>

00:41.317 --> 00:42.390

- Hi.</i>

00:42.467 --> 00:44.583
<i>Where the Boyz 4 Now
open call auditions...</i>

00:44.660 --> 00:46.193
<i>- are about to get underway.
- Hi! I'm on TV!</i>

00:46.270 --> 00:49.247
<i>After popular boy-band
boy Boo Boo left the band,</i>

00:49.324 --> 00:51.869
their album-Three is
more Than Four did not

00:51.946 --> 00:52.945
top the charts.

00:53.022 --> 00:55.482
♪ Three is more than four... ♪

00:55.559 --> 00:58.911
<i>So, the Boyz 3 Now
are hunting for a quote unquote,</i>

00:58.988 --> 01:01.724
<i>"new Boo Boo,"
so they can be four once more.</i>

01:01.801 --> 01:04.747
I'm here with Boyz 4 Now
super-fan Gertie Humikowski.

01:04.824 --> 01:06.788
I don't like that
there are only three.

01:06.865 --> 01:08.477
There has to be four!

01:08.554 --> 01:10.838
<i>And now, the
nationwide talent search is here</i>

01:10.915 --> 01:12.476
<i>in the Seymour's Bay area,</i>

01:12.553 --> 01:15.788
<i>where boys aged 12 to 17
will soon be lining up.</i>

01:15.865 --> 01:18.544
Girls, however, will not
be permitted within 50 yards

01:18.621 --> 01:21.136
of the entrance after several
incidents around the country.

01:21.213 --> 01:23.152
We had to rescue a
girl from an air duct.

01:23.229 --> 01:25.937
She crawled right up in there.
Not safe, girls. Don't do it.

01:26.014 --> 01:29.395
<i>So girls, stay away.
Boys, come to play.</i>

01:29.472 --> 01:31.672
Whoo. That's gonna be
a real smorgas-boy'd.

01:31.749 --> 01:33.159
They're never gonna
find someone

01:33.236 --> 01:34.890
as slappable as Boo
Boo to take his place.

01:34.967 --> 01:37.216
His face fits right
in my tiny little hand.

01:37.293 --> 01:39.472
- Gene, you want to go audition?
- No way.

01:39.549 --> 01:41.671
I'm gonna replace Baby Spice
when she grows up,

01:41.748 --> 01:43.883
but she's just a baby,
so that's gonna be a while.

01:43.960 --> 01:45.494
No one asked me
if I wanted to audition.

01:45.571 --> 01:46.940
I'm the same age as Matt.

01:47.017 --> 01:49.749
- Matt's 89?
- What? No. Matt's 17.

01:49.826 --> 01:51.389
Yeah, sure, sure.
Sure he is.

01:51.466 --> 01:53.166
I think it's gonna be a
good day for the restaurant.

01:53.243 --> 01:55.420
The heat wave is gonna bring
us a lot of foot traffic

01:55.497 --> 01:57.043
from people
heading to the beach, right?

01:57.120 --> 02:00.104
Yeah. They've got feet,
and they got to eat.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.289
Bob, I thought
we got napkins yesterday.

02:02.366 --> 02:04.539
- Where'd they go?
- I must've left them in the car.

02:04.616 --> 02:05.790
Louise, can you go
get them?

02:05.867 --> 02:08.150
You know I can't use my legs, Father.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.092
I have cough-legs.

02:10.169 --> 02:12.226
I wish I could run
like the other children.

02:12.303 --> 02:14.126
I'll go, Dad. I like a little junk
from the trunk.

02:14.203 --> 02:16.298
All right, Tina, the car is
at the curb down the block.

02:16.375 --> 02:18.207
We couldn't pull into
the alley to drop them off

02:18.284 --> 02:19.959
because your mom said
the raccoons

02:20.036 --> 02:21.257
were having
a birthday party.

02:21.334 --> 02:23.111
It wasn't a birthday party,
Bob.

02:23.188 --> 02:25.176
Little King Trash Mouth
and his husband Gary

02:25.253 --> 02:26.973
were renewing their vows,
I think.

02:27.050 --> 02:28.587
It's their anniversary,
so it makes sense.

02:28.664 --> 02:30.680
No, it doesn't,
but it's fine.

02:30.757 --> 02:32.086
- Yeah.
- What?

02:32.163 --> 02:34.062
- No, yeah.
- No. No.

02:34.139 --> 02:35.222
- Yeah. No, it was
- Hmm...

02:35.299 --> 02:36.624
definitely their anniversary,

02:36.701 --> 02:37.846
now that I think about it.

02:37.923 --> 02:39.439
Hey, uh, mm.

02:40.023 --> 02:42.007
- Mm-hmm. Aah!
- Oh.

02:42.084 --> 02:43.611
Oh, my goodness.
I'm so sorry.

02:43.688 --> 02:45.471
Um, can I help you up?

- Oh, yeah.

03:12.587 --> 03:14.221
Uh, hi. I'm Tina.

03:14.298 --> 03:17.028
- Yeah, I'm Damon.
- Damon. Damon.

03:17.105 --> 03:19.095
Yeah. Ah, shoot.
You know what?

03:19.172 --> 03:21.726
I'd love to stay and talk,
but I have to catch a bus

03:21.803 --> 03:23.466
to the convention center for a tryout.

03:23.543 --> 03:25.299
- So bye.
- Oh, good luck.

03:25.376 --> 03:27.402
Uh, thanks.
Sorry about your napkins.

03:27.479 --> 03:29.626
I hope they can still...
clean things.

03:29.703 --> 03:30.961
Damon, I...

03:31.038 --> 03:32.552
Oh. He's gone.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.798
But he left this shoe.

03:33.875 --> 03:35.783
No, wait. That's a pigeon.

03:37.060 --> 03:40.100
Oh, hey, Tina.
Those napkins look different.

03:40.177 --> 03:41.902
Someone bumped into me,
and I dropped them, and also,

03:41.979 --> 03:43.462
my whole life is
probably gonna change now.

03:43.539 --> 03:44.891
Here, Tina, give 'em to me,
hon.

03:44.968 --> 03:46.364
Okay, but I need to keep one

03:46.441 --> 03:48.114
as a souvenir of the day
I met Damon.

03:48.191 --> 03:50.411
He was running to catch the
bus to the Boyz 4 Now auditions,

03:50.488 --> 03:52.421
and he bumped into me,
and we touched hands,

03:52.498 --> 03:53.751
and it might be love at first sight.

03:53.828 --> 03:55.843
- Welp, here we go again.
- What do you mean?

03:55.920 --> 03:58.285
Oh, I don't know. It's not like
you fall in love at first sight

03:58.362 --> 03:59.705
all the time.

04:00.725 --> 04:02.058
Whoa.

04:02.481 --> 04:03.615
Whoa.

04:04.201 --> 04:05.674
Excuse me. Whoa.

04:05.751 --> 04:07.254
Okay, maybe once or twice.

04:07.331 --> 04:08.911
- A minute.
- It's fine.

04:08.988 --> 04:10.153
You're young,
you have fun.

04:10.230 --> 04:11.353
What are you guys trying to say?

04:11.430 --> 04:12.681
We're trying to say
you're something

04:12.758 --> 04:14.486
that rhymes with "shmoy shmazy."

04:14.563 --> 04:15.853
Okay, I'm not boy crazy.

04:15.930 --> 04:17.291
I'm boy... focused.

04:17.369 --> 04:19.158
And I really think
Damon could be the one.

04:19.235 --> 04:21.197
One of... many.
Many ones.

04:21.274 --> 04:22.928
All right, guys,
leave Tina alone.

04:23.005 --> 04:26.094
She has an active
imagination about boys.

04:26.171 --> 04:27.531
It's not my imagination.

04:27.608 --> 04:29.978
My feelings are real.
Damon is probably my soul mate.

04:30.055 --> 04:31.904
I'll-I'll show you.
I'll... I'll go down

04:31.981 --> 04:33.306
to those auditions
and find Damon

04:33.383 --> 04:35.095
- and start our life together.
- Oh, Tina.

04:35.172 --> 04:37.337
They're not gonna let
girls in the auditions.

04:37.414 --> 04:39.994
Remember?
The news? No girls allowed.

04:40.071 --> 04:43.202
Damn it. Well,
then, I'll dress as a boy.

04:43.279 --> 04:44.720
- Ooh, that's fun.
- No.

04:44.797 --> 04:48.817
Not that that's not a great idea,
but we need Tina here.

04:48.894 --> 04:50.244
It-It's gonna be a busy day.

04:50.321 --> 04:51.639
Ugh. Fine.

04:51.716 --> 04:55.183
- Aw.
- "Aw" what?

04:55.260 --> 04:57.953
Tina wants to go find
her crush. It's sweet.

04:58.030 --> 04:59.562
Wait, Linda,
you want her to go?

04:59.639 --> 05:01.402
I don't think
it'll do any harm, Bob.

05:01.479 --> 05:03.113
They'll probably just
spot that she's a girl

05:03.190 --> 05:04.294
and send her home anyway.

05:04.371 --> 05:05.333
Fine.

05:05.410 --> 05:07.963
Tina, we have some good news.

05:08.061 --> 05:09.070
What?

05:09.147 --> 05:13.435
You can dress as a boy
and go find that kid.

05:13.512 --> 05:15.375
I can? Thank you. I'm gonna prove

05:15.504 --> 05:18.183
that Damon's my true love,
so say good-bye to Tina.

05:18.260 --> 05:20.045
And say hello to Dino.

05:20.122 --> 05:23.333
My Annie wig! I knew
she'd live to dance another day.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.468
Next time you see me,
I'll be in a serious relationship

05:25.545 --> 05:27.061
with one boy only. Damon.

05:27.138 --> 05:30.179
I'm not boy crazy.
I've never felt more boy sane.

05:30.643 --> 05:32.695
Am I nuts or is Dino hot?

05:33.409 --> 05:35.570
Linda, Bob. Linda, Bob.

05:35.647 --> 05:37.255
Teddy, what is it?
Why are we whispering?

05:37.332 --> 05:38.837
I-I just need to show
you what's in the box.

05:38.914 --> 05:40.736
I found this at the place
I'm working up the street.

05:40.813 --> 05:43.058
I just need you to take care
of it till I'm off later.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.312
Promise me
you'll take care of it.

05:44.389 --> 05:46.339
- Promise me, promise me!
- What? No.

05:46.416 --> 05:47.733
We don't even know
what it is yet.

05:47.810 --> 05:48.909
Okay. I'll show you.

05:48.986 --> 05:50.942
- No loud noises.
- I'll tell my butt.

05:51.019 --> 05:53.413
Oh, my God, what is it?

05:53.490 --> 05:54.577
What did you do to Mort?

05:54.654 --> 05:56.585
- Huh. Is that a squirrel?
- A squirrel?

05:56.662 --> 05:59.688
You think this cute little guy
is a stupid, lowlife squirrel?

05:59.765 --> 06:01.963
No, I would never bring
a squirrel in here, Bobby.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.312
What do you think,
I'm out of my mind?

06:03.389 --> 06:06.089
- What is it then?
- It's a rat. A baby rat.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.727
- Oh. Okay, get out.
- Bob, no, please, please.

06:08.804 --> 06:10.369
We can't have a rat in
the restaurant, Teddy.

06:10.446 --> 06:12.853
It's just for a couple of
hours. Otherwise, he's gonna die.

06:12.930 --> 06:14.134
- Okay.
- All you got to do is

06:14.211 --> 06:15.589
keep him warm
with a heating pad,

06:15.666 --> 06:17.069
and then give him
some sugar water.

06:17.146 --> 06:18.624
- You can do that, right, Bobby?
- Hmm.

06:18.701 --> 06:20.294
I've nursed dozens of baby rats.

06:20.371 --> 06:22.063
Your nipples must be a mess.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.464
Look, Teddy, I'm sorry.

06:23.541 --> 06:24.882
It's just that we can't...

06:25.014 --> 06:26.773
Oh, my God, look at it.

06:27.024 --> 06:28.304
I'm crying.

06:28.544 --> 06:30.348
I would die for this rat.

06:34.752 --> 06:36.732
Ugh. What was I thinking?

06:36.809 --> 06:38.343
No one's gonna believe
I'm a boy.

06:38.420 --> 06:40.060
Oh, my God, a boy!

06:40.137 --> 06:42.058
That's right, sweetheart. Yes!

06:42.180 --> 06:44.504
<i>Okay, just gonna pop in,
find Damon,</i>

06:44.581 --> 06:46.427
<i>tell him I think we're
meant to be together forever,</i>

06:46.504 --> 06:48.056
<i>and I won't get distracted
by all the other...</i>

06:48.133 --> 06:49.966
Oh, my God.

06:55.462 --> 06:58.163
Aah, so many butts age 12 to 17.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.963
Okay. Focus, Tina.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.863
Damon's here somewhere. All I have to do

07:01.940 --> 07:03.965
is stand in line and not get distracted.

07:04.042 --> 07:05.953
Dude, you got any gum?

07:07.998 --> 07:10.968
♪ Oh, I know that I'm
just asking for gum ♪

07:12.299 --> 07:14.882
♪ And that I might
seem pretty dumb ♪

07:14.974 --> 07:16.610
♪ But I could be real fun ♪

07:16.687 --> 07:18.831
♪ I could be the one ♪

07:18.908 --> 07:20.343
♪ Now sweat. ♪

07:20.428 --> 07:21.918
Sweat...

07:22.296 --> 07:25.018
Aah! No, I'm here for
Damon! Uh, uh, uh...

07:25.892 --> 07:27.657
Ah! Ha-ha, not going in there.

07:27.825 --> 07:28.878
That was a... joke.

07:28.955 --> 07:30.931
Come on, Dino, don't stress.

07:31.030 --> 07:33.516
You're a strong, confident young
man who isn't afraid of urinals.

07:33.593 --> 07:34.930
Good for you, man.

07:35.007 --> 07:37.555
Coming in. Just another
boy, so no big deal.

07:37.632 --> 07:38.801
<i>So, Teddy said we need</i>

07:38.878 --> 07:40.586
to keep him very warm
on the heating pad

07:40.663 --> 07:42.133
and feed him
every one to two hours.

07:42.210 --> 07:44.998
Or her.
Girls can be rats, too, Bob.

07:45.075 --> 07:47.831
It does look like
she has a little penis, though. Aw.

07:47.908 --> 07:50.292
- It's bigger than yours, Mom.
- Gene.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.620
- Aw...
- Baby.

07:52.782 --> 07:55.944
Okay, this heating pad shuts off
automatically every 30 minutes,

07:56.021 --> 07:57.799
- so we'll need to set a timer.
- On it.

07:57.876 --> 07:59.678
And I've got his sugar
water all mixed up

07:59.755 --> 08:00.751
for when he gets hungry.

08:00.828 --> 08:02.655
And I'm gonna order him
the box set of The Wire

08:02.732 --> 08:04.667
- for when he's ready.
- And I'll teach him how to fight.

08:04.744 --> 08:07.384
Probably Brazilian jiu-jitsu,
because he's so small.

08:07.461 --> 08:09.297
A lot of ground stuff,
lot of grappling.

08:09.374 --> 08:13.429
Hello. Bob's Burgers.
Oh, hi, Teddy. What's that?

08:13.506 --> 08:16.618
Oh. Okay.
All right, new thing:

08:16.695 --> 08:18.898
Teddy says we got to rub
the rat's butt and genitals

08:18.975 --> 08:20.565
to make it pee and
poop after we feed it.

08:20.642 --> 08:21.646
That's all you, Dad.

08:21.723 --> 08:23.370
I probably shouldn't
be the one to do that,

08:23.447 --> 08:26.331
- since I cook all the food.
- Well, and I carry all the food.

08:26.408 --> 08:29.248
- And I eat all the food.
- And I don't want to.

08:29.325 --> 08:31.979
Fine, I'll just wash
my hands really, really well.

08:32.056 --> 08:33.383
Like how surgeons do.

08:33.460 --> 08:35.215
That's kind of cool.
I'll scrub in.

08:35.292 --> 08:38.071
There you go, Dad.
You're like a cool, smelly surgeon.

08:38.148 --> 08:39.309
Dr. McGreasy.

08:39.386 --> 08:41.909
I like the rat more
than I like all of you.

08:42.669 --> 08:44.700
<i>Focusing on Damon with
all these other boys around</i>

08:44.777 --> 08:46.905
<i>is gonna be harder than I thought.
Aah!</i>

08:46.982 --> 08:48.902
Oh, sorry, I didn't
think anyone was in here.

08:48.979 --> 08:50.880
That-that's okay. Are you hiding, too?

08:50.957 --> 08:52.784
- Um, kinda.
- My name's Chad.

08:52.861 --> 08:54.563
I'm Dino. Why are you hiding in here?

08:54.640 --> 08:57.200
Well, uh, I guess I'm just nervous.

08:57.277 --> 08:59.456
I-I just wish I had a
friend here, you know?

08:59.533 --> 09:02.823
To talk to. But all-all
my best friends are girls.

09:02.900 --> 09:03.846
Oh, really?

09:03.923 --> 09:05.045

10:11.138 --> 10:12.547
- Ah! Damon!
- Chad.

10:12.624 --> 10:14.578
No, I know. S-Sorry,
I-I got to go.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.938
Look, I put a little
table in there for him.

10:17.015 --> 10:18.391
I made it out of a bottle cap.

10:18.468 --> 10:19.659
Should we make him
some chairs?

10:19.736 --> 10:21.393
- Put in a little rug?
- Lava lamp.

10:21.470 --> 10:22.940
Beanbag. One bean.

10:23.017 --> 10:24.410
Hello? Bob!

10:24.487 --> 10:27.391
Your not-friendly
health inspector's here.

10:28.215 --> 10:30.394
Oh, my God, it's Hugo.

10:30.471 --> 10:32.209
Crap, crap, crap, crap!

10:34.809 --> 10:35.890
Thank you.

10:35.967 --> 10:38.051
Normally, I wouldn't
drink your water, Bob,

10:38.128 --> 10:40.484
but I'm inspecting the outdoor
stands at the beach today.

10:40.561 --> 10:43.541
It's hot out there, and I'm
very susceptible to dehydration.

10:43.618 --> 10:45.098
They should keep
dumping water on you,

10:45.175 --> 10:46.646
like when they transport a dolphin.

10:46.723 --> 10:48.858
Well, you probably got
to get going, so, uh...

10:48.940 --> 10:50.992
You know what?
I think I'll have another water.

10:51.069 --> 10:52.633
I'm not driving.

10:55.996 --> 10:58.369
Great. Great. Great,
great, great, great, great.

10:58.446 --> 11:01.977
- Can we just kill him?
- Maybe, honey. Maybe.

11:02.634 --> 11:04.828
All right, focus, focus, focus.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.575
He's cute.

11:06.731 --> 11:08.891
Damon! I'm coming for you!

11:09.575 --> 11:11.402
I'm okay. Dino's okay.

11:14.768 --> 11:18.299
Damon! Hi. Excuse me, um,
can I cut in front of you?

11:18.376 --> 11:20.616
My little brother is way up in the line,

11:20.693 --> 11:22.319
and he forgot his healthy snack?

11:22.396 --> 11:24.010
- Yeah, sure, whatever.
- All right, thanks.

11:24.087 --> 11:25.274
Hey, can I cut in front of you?

11:25.351 --> 11:27.222
My brother's up ahead,
and he forgot his shoes.

11:27.299 --> 11:29.575
His voice medicine.
His lucky rabbit's butt.

11:29.652 --> 11:31.509
Hi, um, is there any way
I can cut in front of you?

11:31.586 --> 11:32.695
- See, my little...
- What? No.

11:32.772 --> 11:34.150
- But-but I...
- Dude, you got to wait in line

11:34.227 --> 11:35.616
like the rest of us, all right?

11:36.274 --> 11:37.504
Ugh, you have to let me through.

11:37.581 --> 11:39.521
My brother is ahead of me in line.

11:39.598 --> 11:40.953
He's holding my place,

11:41.030 --> 11:43.927
and I promised my mom,
Barbara, that I would watch him.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.958
His name is Simon Garfunkel,

11:46.035 --> 11:48.371
and he loves to laugh.
All of that is true.

11:48.448 --> 11:50.687
No dice, Beans and Rice.
You're not getting by me.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.367
Whoa.

11:53.444 --> 11:55.290
And in conclusion, that is why I think

11:55.367 --> 11:57.138
we should buy the company
I was talking about.

11:57.215 --> 11:58.471

- Girl. I got a girl here!
- Oh, crud.

13:39.338 --> 13:40.963
Hey! Somebody stop that dude.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.667
He's cutting in line,
it's totally not fair.

13:42.744 --> 13:45.417
Rules are rules, guys. Rules are rules.

13:46.491 --> 13:48.495
All right, Bob, thank
you for all the water.

13:48.572 --> 13:50.057
I don't know
why I'm so parched.

13:50.134 --> 13:51.430
You're a thirsty bitch.

13:51.507 --> 13:53.163
- Gene, don't say that.
- Why not?

13:53.240 --> 13:56.060
Well, I'm not gonna pay you
for it because it's just water.

13:56.137 --> 13:57.476
Great, bye.

13:57.741 --> 13:59.085
What was that?

13:59.162 --> 14:02.538
Oh, t-that was my, uh,
uh, text notification.

14:02.615 --> 14:05.362
Text notification, really?
Who's the text from, Bob?

14:05.439 --> 14:08.803
Oh, uh, my, uh, mistress.
She's, uh, gross.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.709
Uh, s-she's fine. We're all fine.

14:10.786 --> 14:12.128
Okay, I'll see you later, bye.

14:12.205 --> 14:13.966
I didn't mean the ding, Bob.

14:14.043 --> 14:15.295
I meant the squeaks.

14:15.372 --> 14:17.270
Uh, let me, uh,
let me go check on that.

14:17.347 --> 14:19.048
Pick and roll, Gene. Pick and roll.

14:19.183 --> 14:20.700
Whoa.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.091
Drag him down, drag him down!

14:22.168 --> 14:24.714
- I am! Grab a leg!
- Get off of me!

14:24.792 --> 14:25.867
Aha!

14:25.992 --> 14:27.784
Just flipping the burgers, Hugo.

14:27.861 --> 14:29.635
What burgers, Bob?

14:29.712 --> 14:31.641
Didn't we tell you?
Dad went insane.

14:31.718 --> 14:34.047
It's okay, Dad. Flip your burgers.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.396
<i>Hmm, that's funny.
I thought I was going insane,</i>

14:36.473 --> 14:39.108
because for a minute there,
I thought I heard the sound

14:39.185 --> 14:40.676
of a squeaking baby rat!

14:40.753 --> 14:41.820
Oh! What?

14:41.897 --> 14:44.145
And I bet he's right there!

14:44.320 --> 14:48.480
Time for me to say hello
to your little friend.

14:49.426 --> 14:50.924
What in the...?

14:51.146 --> 14:52.566
I know there was a rat in there.

14:52.643 --> 14:54.130
I've seen this a thousand times.

14:54.207 --> 14:56.687
The heating pad, the tiny
little table you made for him.

14:56.764 --> 14:59.117
As if he would ever eat at
that table. It's ridiculous!

14:59.194 --> 15:02.495
Uh, well, Hugo, we just had the
heating pad down here for, uh...

15:02.650 --> 15:03.782
My PMS.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.641
So hormonal right now, so angry.

15:05.718 --> 15:07.152
Yeah. That's why I have a mistress.

15:07.229 --> 15:09.843
And Gene and I were
playing tomato dolls.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.244
Yeah, we-we take the tomatoes and...

15:12.321 --> 15:14.529
And put them in that box.

15:14.606 --> 15:15.777
Yeah, tomato dolls.

15:15.854 --> 15:17.998
Eh, we can't afford toys.
Sad.

15:18.764 --> 15:19.969
There it is again!

15:20.046 --> 15:23.085
Bob, is that rat in your underwear?

15:23.162 --> 15:25.132
Well, Hugo, I'm pretty
sure you're not allowed

15:25.209 --> 15:26.910
to look at my privates, so I guess...

15:26.987 --> 15:29.794
we'll never know.

15:29.871 --> 15:31.775
God, I respect this man.

15:32.133 --> 15:35.011
A-And, uh, and now
we're closing, so, uh,

15:35.088 --> 15:36.939
- closing time, bye.
- Yeah, yeah. That's right.

15:37.016 --> 15:41.611
We are closed for the day,
so good-bye Hu...

15:42.025 --> 15:44.283
Get out of here! Get away from my dad!

15:44.360 --> 15:46.169
Fine. You win this one, Bob.

15:46.246 --> 15:49.384
But I'll be back with a
warrant for your underwear.

15:49.461 --> 15:51.005
Aaah! Just go.

15:51.082 --> 15:52.818
Stop it. Stop pushing me.

15:55.479 --> 15:57.148
Ugh. Okay, I got to get it out.

15:57.225 --> 15:58.916
Oh, God, it's going lower.

15:58.993 --> 16:00.905
Bob, no!

16:00.982 --> 16:04.463
Ah, ah, oh! Oh, wait,
it's-it's fine now.

16:08.904 --> 16:10.216
- Damon.
- Yeah?

16:10.293 --> 16:13.117
Hi. Um, I don't know
if you'll recognize me.

16:13.194 --> 16:14.753
- We met earlier today.
- Uh...

16:14.830 --> 16:17.345
Oh. We did. Sure.

16:17.422 --> 16:19.410
No, I don't. I don't remember you.

16:19.487 --> 16:21.229

colleague slash girlfriend Tina.

16:48.259 --> 16:50.876
You're supposed to be down on
the ground doing ground stuff.

16:50.953 --> 16:53.071
- I finished it.
- Well, maybe space

16:53.148 --> 16:54.541
isn't big enough for the both of us.

16:54.618 --> 16:56.587
Yeah. You're right.
That's why you should leave.

16:56.664 --> 16:59.247
I'll stay here with Tina,
and you go do ground stuff.

16:59.324 --> 17:01.820

17:43.009 --> 17:44.627
Just want to whip them off
real quick?

17:44.704 --> 17:46.188
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

17:46.301 --> 17:47.363
Damn it.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.511
Damon, I am so sorry.

17:49.588 --> 17:52.269
- Sorry for what?
- For not loving you enough.

17:52.346 --> 17:54.705
- I'm sorry, what?
- Um... What's happening?

17:54.782 --> 17:56.245
Yes, that's right. It's me.

17:56.322 --> 17:58.928
The beautiful, aloof, yet very
kind girl who carries napkins.

17:59.006 --> 18:01.363
Oh, uh...
Yeah, yeah. From earlier.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.349
Yes. From that incredible moment.

18:03.426 --> 18:05.360
- I mean, ah... mm-Kay.
- Shh.

18:05.437 --> 18:07.766
I came here to find you so
we could turn that moment

18:07.843 --> 18:09.007
into a million moments.

18:09.084 --> 18:11.734
But my family was right.
I am boy crazy.

18:11.811 --> 18:13.652
Aah!
I'm nuts for butts.

18:13.729 --> 18:15.338
Hey, it's a girl!

18:19.483 --> 18:22.643
I've got seven non-boys
in the warm-up room.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.211
Requesting backup.

18:28.428 --> 18:29.783
So, she's not in any real trouble,

18:29.860 --> 18:32.160
but we got to make sure an
adult takes the girls home,

18:32.237 --> 18:34.781
or else they keep sneaking
in over and over again.

18:35.426 --> 18:37.625
God, I didn't think this
is how my life would turn out.

18:37.702 --> 18:40.552
So, where is he? Where's the
dream boy to top all dream boys?

18:40.629 --> 18:42.093
Out getting a marriage license?

18:42.170 --> 18:43.499
No, you were right.

18:43.576 --> 18:45.417
You were all right.
I am boy crazy.

18:45.494 --> 18:48.769
I fantasized about 3.5 other
boys on my way to find Damon.

18:48.846 --> 18:51.185
Couldn't even make it one
afternoon focused on one boy.

18:51.262 --> 18:53.599
- Aw. You know what, Tina?
- What?

18:53.676 --> 18:55.664
I think it's great
that you're boy crazy.

18:55.741 --> 18:56.934
- You do?
- Of course.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.467
We all think it's great.
Right?

18:58.544 --> 18:59.877
- I love it.
- Get it, girl!

18:59.954 --> 19:01.484
You love it, too. Right, Bob?

19:01.561 --> 19:05.333
Yeah, I think it's great that
you go crazy a lot for them.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.856
Huh.
Maybe being boy crazy is okay.

19:07.933 --> 19:10.404
It's great. You have
imagination and heart.

19:10.481 --> 19:11.933
You're a hopeful romantic.

19:12.010 --> 19:14.149
You fall in love as many
times as you want, honey.

19:14.226 --> 19:15.839
Each one is lucky to have you.

19:15.916 --> 19:17.439
Except Jimmy Jr.
I'm not sold on him.

19:17.516 --> 19:18.633
- Wait, what?
- Nothing.

19:18.710 --> 19:19.882
We
Need everyone to the front

19:19.959 --> 19:22.293
of the convention center.
The winner is being announced.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.431
- Winner? That was quick.
- Yeah, the boys are gonna sing

19:24.508 --> 19:26.150
with the winner out in
front of the building.

19:26.227 --> 19:28.338
You want to come out and watch
this dumb publicity stunt?

19:28.415 --> 19:29.545
How dumb we talking?

19:29.622 --> 19:31.330
I could go for another
visit to the boy-ffet.

19:31.407 --> 19:32.481
There she is.

19:32.558 --> 19:33.859
Dad, why are you carrying a box?

19:33.936 --> 19:35.300
Oh, it's Teddy's baby rat.

19:35.377 --> 19:37.476
- We're kind of co-parenting.
- Can I see him?

19:37.553 --> 19:39.786
He-he's gonna be a mess
if we wake him up from his nap.

19:39.863 --> 19:41.944
- Can we do it later?
- I was just being nice.

19:42.021 --> 19:44.195
- I don't really want to see him.
- Yeah, right.

19:44.429 --> 19:45.878
Ladies and girls,

19:45.955 --> 19:49.987
put your hands together
for Matt, Griffin, Allen!

19:50.067 --> 19:52.346
And let's meet the
newest member of the band.

19:52.423 --> 19:54.594
He's coming out of the crowd right now.

19:54.671 --> 19:58.602
Who is he? Come on up here and
let us get a look at your face.

20:02.083 --> 20:03.660
Boo Boo!

20:03.737 --> 20:05.484
Did you miss me?

20:06.603 --> 20:09.629
I mean, I-is it him?
I-I'm not even sure. Who cares?

20:09.706 --> 20:13.652
Because I missed you.
But mostly, I missed myself.

20:13.729 --> 20:15.754
Because I just wasn't
myself without these guys.
