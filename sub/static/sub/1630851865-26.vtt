Whoa, Ollie! That's really good!

00:40.440 --> 00:42.120
I wanna try drawing, too!

00:42.280 --> 00:44.239
Wanna use my favourite pencil?

00:44.360 --> 00:46.440
It's the best pencil in the world!

00:46.559 --> 00:49.040
Thanks, but I like this red pencil.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.599
Nope. Can't do it. Drawing's not my thing.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.360
What? But you barely even tried!

00:59.480 --> 01:01.400
Yeah, but it didn't turn out right!

01:01.519 --> 01:02.839
Drawing takes practice.

01:02.959 --> 01:05.880
My first drawing looked like this...

01:06.000 --> 01:08.039
But then I took lessons and practised,

01:08.240 --> 01:10.800
and now my drawings look like this!

01:10.960 --> 01:13.399
-Whoa!
-Stanley, that's awesome!

01:13.520 --> 01:16.520
Thanks! My cousin Estella gave me lessons.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.360
She's an amazing art teacher!

01:18.479 --> 01:19.440
Moon...

01:19.560 --> 01:21.479
Are you having a brainstorm?

01:21.640 --> 01:22.960
Hmm... No.

01:23.119 --> 01:27.080
You sure? Cause if you were,
I think I know what it would be!

01:27.200 --> 01:29.520
We should take
a drawing lesson from Estella!

01:29.640 --> 01:33.160
Great! Except... she lives in Peru.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.560
-Peru?
-Yep.

01:34.679 --> 01:37.920
The land of beautiful landscapes
and ancient ruins.

01:38.080 --> 01:41.320
-Artists love it.
-That does sound inspiring.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.119
And it's where I discovered pepinos,

01:44.240 --> 01:46.280
these little fruits
that look like a cucumber

01:46.440 --> 01:47.920
but taste like a melon.

01:48.039 --> 01:49.000
Mmm.

01:49.119 --> 01:53.399
So Peru is inspiring
and it has delicious treats?

01:53.559 --> 01:55.520
-Let's go!
-I dunno, Moon.

01:55.640 --> 01:58.520
On the one hand, Peru is awfully far away!

01:58.640 --> 02:01.839
But on the other hand,
Stanley's sketches are really great.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.360
But then, on another hand...

02:04.559 --> 02:07.000
There are no more hands!
We're going to Peru!

02:07.479 --> 02:08.880
Wait! I need my favourite pencil!

02:09.000 --> 02:10.840
I can't draw without it!

02:17.960 --> 02:18.880
Whoo!

02:20.160 --> 02:21.519
Whee!

02:28.200 --> 02:29.640
Tic-tac-toe time!

02:29.760 --> 02:31.560
Ollie, may I borrow your pencil?

02:31.680 --> 02:33.880
Sure. But make sure you give it back!

02:34.400 --> 02:37.640
<i>We're now approaching Peru!</i>

02:43.079 --> 02:46.359
Cousin Estella, these are my friends!

02:46.519 --> 02:48.920
Ollie! Moon!

02:49.040 --> 02:52.920
I'm so happy to meet you!

02:53.079 --> 02:54.920
[muffled] Us, too.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.840
And teach you drawing!

02:57.000 --> 03:01.320
And show you funny pictures
of Stanley when he was little!

03:03.799 --> 03:08.600
Estella! I don't think Ollie and Moon
are interested in seeing those!

03:09.399 --> 03:10.840
Phew! Here's my bus.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.040
I'm off to pick
Peruvian pepinos for pickling!

03:14.320 --> 03:16.560
-<i>Adios</i>!
-<i>Adios</i>!

03:18.120 --> 03:23.160
And now is the part
where I turn you into great artists!

03:23.560 --> 03:25.399
Will you be famous? Possibly.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.600
Rich? Maybe.

03:27.720 --> 03:31.160
Will your drawings hang in museums?

03:31.320 --> 03:32.720
It could happen.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.720
-Whoa!
-Museums?

03:35.000 --> 03:40.119
But... only if you do one thing very well!

03:40.399 --> 03:43.280
And that one thing is...

03:43.560 --> 03:46.640
-To really want it to happen?
-To practise!

03:47.760 --> 03:49.880
First you will fill one sketchbook

03:50.000 --> 03:51.480
with nothing but circles!

03:52.440 --> 03:54.840
Then you will fill another sketchbook

03:54.959 --> 03:56.880
with nothing but squares!

03:57.200 --> 04:01.000
Then circles inside squares,
squares inside circles,

04:01.160 --> 04:04.480
circles on top of squares
beside circles between squares

04:04.640 --> 04:09.519
and, finally,
sometime in the very distant future...

04:09.760 --> 04:10.600
triangles!

04:13.280 --> 04:16.039
Wouldn't it be more fun to draw things?

04:16.159 --> 04:18.159
Like... this llama?

04:20.159 --> 04:24.120
Ho, ho, ho! Oh, my darling!

04:24.240 --> 04:26.800
How do you think Stanley
learned how to draw?

04:27.120 --> 04:30.760
He filled a mountain of sketchbooks!

04:31.479 --> 04:34.719
How will I ever be able
to practise that much?

04:34.880 --> 04:37.560
Maybe this class wasn't such a good idea.

04:37.680 --> 04:38.520
I dunno, Moon.

04:39.280 --> 04:43.960
Using an entire sketch book
to get each shape exactly right?

04:44.120 --> 04:45.240
I love it!

04:46.120 --> 04:47.680
-Aaah!
-Aaah!

04:47.840 --> 04:51.120
My favourite pencil!
Stanley forgot to give it back!

04:51.240 --> 04:54.520
-And I can't draw without it!
-Why not borrow one of mine?

04:54.640 --> 04:57.400
I call this colour Estella Yella.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.919
No, Estella,
we really need to go find Stanley

05:01.080 --> 05:03.400
and get Ollie's favourite pencil back!

05:04.000 --> 05:08.800
So I'm afraid we're going to have to miss
all this great practice,

05:08.960 --> 05:11.440
but don't worry, we'll be back soon!

05:11.560 --> 05:12.919
Adios!

05:19.479 --> 05:22.520
OK, Ollie. Keep your eyes out for Stanley!

05:22.640 --> 05:23.760
And my pencil!

05:24.320 --> 05:26.599
Wow, this is amazing!

05:28.680 --> 05:30.640
Look at all those circles!

05:30.760 --> 05:34.640
So... tidy.
They're the perfect thing to draw!

05:35.880 --> 05:37.960
If I had my favourite pencil, that is.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.919
Look! I think I see Stanley!

05:41.520 --> 05:42.719
-Stanley!
-Stanley!

05:42.880 --> 05:44.719
-Stanley!
-Stanley!

05:55.560 --> 05:56.640
Gotcha!

05:58.880 --> 06:01.359
Oops! You're definitely not Stanley!

06:01.680 --> 06:02.680
Sorry!

06:03.080 --> 06:06.000
[sighs] Moon, it's really hot

06:06.120 --> 06:09.120
and Stanley could be
anywhere in these mountains!

06:10.039 --> 06:12.000
I think we should just go back to Estella

06:12.159 --> 06:13.719
and wait for Stanley to come back.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.760
You mean give up? No way!

06:16.880 --> 06:20.919
All we need is a little more time...
and some water!

06:22.080 --> 06:24.479
-Two, please!
-Thanks!

06:27.080 --> 06:29.000
You haven't seen a snail, have you?

06:29.159 --> 06:32.719
About yay tall, big round eyes,
extra slimy?

06:32.880 --> 06:34.560
And carrying my favourite pencil?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.799
-I can't picture that.
-Quick, Ollie!

06:37.919 --> 06:40.760
Draw a picture
in your emergency pocket sketchbook

06:40.919 --> 06:44.240
so we can show this nice water guy
what Stanley looks like!

06:44.359 --> 06:45.960
I can't draw with that, Moon!

06:46.080 --> 06:48.000
I need my favourite pencil.

06:48.159 --> 06:52.000
Ollie, this is how we'll find
your favourite pencil!

06:52.200 --> 06:54.840
-You draw it, Moon.
-No, you draw it!

06:54.960 --> 06:56.080
-You!
-You!

06:56.280 --> 06:58.320
You! Please?

06:58.680 --> 06:59.960
Fine.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.960
It's no use! I can't do it!

07:05.080 --> 07:07.479
Sure you can, Moon! Just take it slow.

07:07.880 --> 07:10.680
Start by drawing a circle,
to make Stanley's shell.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.719
Just copy those circles.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.239
Hmm.

07:16.599 --> 07:21.039
Yeah! Now draw two smaller circles
to make Stanley's eyes!

07:23.760 --> 07:25.680
This is the snail. Have you seen him?

07:26.200 --> 07:28.880
-Nope!
-See, Ollie. It's true.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.440
-I can't draw!
-Wait, Moon!

07:31.560 --> 07:33.520
-Stanley was wearing a cap!
-Yes!

07:37.599 --> 07:39.840
Oh, that guy!

07:39.960 --> 07:42.479
Sure. I sold him a bottle of water.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.239
He's hiking to Machu Picchu,
that mountain peak over there!

07:46.560 --> 07:48.799
See, Moon? Your drawing worked!

07:48.919 --> 07:50.560
Maybe I can draw!

07:50.799 --> 07:54.560
I'm going to practise drawing
all the way to Machu Picchu!

08:24.479 --> 08:27.000
And we're running out of time
to finish Estella's class!

08:27.640 --> 08:28.640
Hmm.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.919
Hey! Stanley said he wanted
to pick Peruvian pepinos

08:33.400 --> 08:34.799
for pickling, right?

08:35.439 --> 08:39.400
So he must be over there!
To the pickling pepino place!

08:39.520 --> 08:40.400
<i>Pronto</i>!

08:42.600 --> 08:44.079
Stanley!

08:44.319 --> 08:47.959
Ollie, practising isn't so bad! I just...

08:48.120 --> 08:51.040
Uh-oh. Remember all that water I drank?

08:51.160 --> 08:54.680
Well, now I've really
got to go the bathroom!

08:54.800 --> 08:57.520
[gasps] Maybe he'll know
where the nearest bathroom is!

08:57.640 --> 08:58.480
[singing]

08:58.600 --> 09:00.000
Excuse me, sir?

09:00.800 --> 09:03.560
He's wearing headphones, Moon!
He can't hear you!

09:05.319 --> 09:06.240
Hey!

09:08.000 --> 09:10.120
He thinks we're just being friendly!

09:10.240 --> 09:12.800
Wait. I'm having a brainstorm!

09:12.959 --> 09:14.199
You better have it fast!

09:14.319 --> 09:17.240
Now that you know you can draw,
draw a picture of a bathroom,

09:17.360 --> 09:19.000
and we'll show it to the farmer!

09:19.120 --> 09:22.040
I can't stand still long enough to draw!

09:22.160 --> 09:23.800
-You do it!
-But...

09:23.920 --> 09:25.600
I don't have my favourite pencil.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.640
Ollie, please!

09:27.920 --> 09:29.000
Uh...

09:31.560 --> 09:33.120
OK, I'll do it.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.760
Oh! Heh, heh!

09:43.680 --> 09:44.920
Thanks, sir!

09:47.720 --> 09:51.400
Wow! I guess I can draw
without my favourite pencil!

09:51.520 --> 09:53.280
Oof! That was close!

09:53.400 --> 09:56.120
Thanks, Ol, that was a great drawing!

09:56.319 --> 09:59.959
Now, let's find Stanley
and get your favourite pencil!

10:00.120 --> 10:01.920
You know what, Moon? I don't need it!

10:02.319 --> 10:04.319
Let's go back to Estella's drawing class

10:04.439 --> 10:05.880
and I'll use one of hers!

10:08.959 --> 10:12.120
My beautiful young artists!

10:12.680 --> 10:14.240
We missed you!

10:14.400 --> 10:15.560
Huh?

10:16.280 --> 10:17.319
Hey, guys!

10:17.439 --> 10:19.400
Sorry, Ollie,
I forgot to return your pencil!

10:19.520 --> 10:21.959
Keep it! I'm gonna try drawing with...

10:22.120 --> 10:23.439
Estella Yella!

10:23.560 --> 10:26.319
And now, I need circles!

10:26.480 --> 10:30.959
Easy peasy!
I've drawn a lot of circles today!

10:31.079 --> 10:31.920
You were right.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.319
Practising really does help
make you a better artist!

10:35.439 --> 10:37.600
<i>Maravillosa</i>!

10:37.720 --> 10:39.920
What are we gonna draw next, Moon?

10:40.079 --> 10:41.880
I'm having a brainstorm!

10:44.079 --> 10:46.120
I'm still not as good as Stanley,

10:46.240 --> 10:48.280
but I'll get better with more practice!

10:48.400 --> 10:49.760
Well, I love it!

10:49.880 --> 10:52.959
After all,
it's a picture of my favourite thing.

10:53.079 --> 10:53.959
Pickles?

10:54.079 --> 10:55.199
Best friends.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.240
[laughter]

10:57.400 --> 10:59.360
Pickles... Ha, ha, ha!
