52:38.285 --> 52:39.721
What is it?

52:39.852 --> 52:44.248
There's someone I think
you should meet.

52:46.772 --> 52:48.687
[ alarm buzzes ]

53:03.615 --> 53:04.659
[ knocking on door ]

53:06.574 --> 53:08.402
Would you come with me, please?

53:08.533 --> 53:10.361
Mm.

53:12.580 --> 53:15.279
We've got a breakthrough,
courtesy of a new source.

53:15.409 --> 53:17.194
Excellent.

53:17.324 --> 53:18.804
Yeah, I think you're
going to like it.

53:19.935 --> 53:21.894
Open the door.

53:22.024 --> 53:23.591
What I'm about to show you,

53:23.722 --> 53:26.115
it's of utmost importance
it stays between us.

53:35.908 --> 53:37.039
Hello.

53:41.305 --> 53:42.958
You look like
you've just seen a ghost.
