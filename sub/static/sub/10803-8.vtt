about this mission with the Kes?

00:47.589 --> 00:49.173
Not worried, exactly.

00:50.258 --> 00:52.634
This notion of admitting
half their planet

00:52.802 --> 00:55.262
while leaving the other half out.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.807
First of all,
the Kes are not half the planet,

00:58.975 --> 01:01.101
they're nearly three-quarters of it.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.604
And the Prytt are not being left out.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.689
They themselves
simply don't want to have contact

01:05.857 --> 01:08.358
with anyone from the outside,
not the Federation or anyone else.

01:08.526 --> 01:13.655
Every member of the Federation
entered as a unified world.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.783
And that unity
said something about them,

01:15.950 --> 01:20.037
that they had resolved
certain social and political differences

01:20.205 --> 01:23.791
and they were now ready
to become part of a larger community.

01:23.958 --> 01:27.461
By all indications, the Kes are
a very unified, very progressive people.

01:27.629 --> 01:28.837
But the Prytt are not.

01:29.005 --> 01:31.840
They're reclusive
to the point of xenophobia.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.009

the world government in 21 50?

06:12.622 --> 06:13.997

06:14.165 --> 06:17.000
If you could tell us why you've
taken us hostage, we might be able--

06:17.168 --> 06:20.045
You are not hostages.
You are prisoners.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.797
Prisoners on whose authority?

06:21.964 --> 06:25.550
You're being held under the authority
of the Prytt Security Ministry.

conspiring with the enemy.

06:29.639 --> 06:30.764
We are not fools.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.391
We are aware
of the Federation attempt

06:32.558 --> 06:34.351

with the Kes.

in trying to mislead us, captain.

implanted in your cerebral cortexes

06:46.197 --> 06:48.782

At that time, we will be able to get
all the information we need.

that we are telling the truth.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.849
There is nothing wrong
with the transporter.

I have run a complete diagnostic
of all the targeting components.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.479
Then what happened
to the captain and Dr. Crusher?

07:19.647 --> 07:23.859
Commander, the transporter sensor
log shows an unusual concentration

07:24.026 --> 07:26.987
of antigraviton particles
in the emitter coil.

07:27.155 --> 07:31.700
A concentration of antigraviton
particles suggests a tractor beam.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.077
It might have deflected
the transporter beam

07:34.245 --> 07:35.745
to a different set of coordinates.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.498
Is there a way
to locate those coordinates?

07:39.250 --> 07:42.419
The tractor beam originated
somewhere in the Prytt Alliance.

07:42.587 --> 07:45.005
What does the Prytt want
with Captain Picard and Dr. Crusher?

07:45.173 --> 07:46.173

to find out.

all outside contact.

how to get out of here.

that would allow us to escape.

08:20.917 --> 08:21.958
Right.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.628

during any confinement

08:24.795 --> 08:26.755

we won't starve to death.

must be working for the Kes.

holds you or the Kes government

10:06.105 --> 10:07.439

10:07.607 --> 10:10.233
Our primary concern
is not to assign blame

10:10.401 --> 10:12.235

10:12.403 --> 10:13.570

attempted a diplomatic effort yet.

any diplomatic option, commander.

We have no formal relations
with the Prytt, no ambassadors.

10:33.507 --> 10:35.342

to contact them.

of such a system.
