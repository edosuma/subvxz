20:14.430 --> 20:17.738
This will not change.

20:17.781 --> 20:20.480
Then I must be
one with them, too.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.134
Look.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.706
It's I, it's sister Ivory.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.447
I've returned from the elder.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.275
Kneel!

20:33.319 --> 20:34.972
Worship your master!

20:35.016 --> 20:37.192
What's happened?

20:37.236 --> 20:38.933
What happened?

20:38.976 --> 20:41.283
Men.

20:41.327 --> 20:44.068
Everything's gone.

20:44.112 --> 20:47.158
Everything's ashes.

20:47.202 --> 20:48.203
No.

20:50.771 --> 20:51.989
[crying]
No!

20:58.779 --> 21:01.085
They will pay for this.

21:01.129 --> 21:02.348
This new power I have.

21:02.391 --> 21:03.827
I'm going to give it to you.

21:03.871 --> 21:06.874
I'm going to give it
to all of you.

21:06.917 --> 21:11.966
And together the sisterhood
will rule.

21:24.021 --> 21:26.067
We're doing the best we can.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.809
That's all we can ask
of ourselves,

21:28.852 --> 21:31.072
that's all we can ask
of the kids, too.

21:31.115 --> 21:34.031
I know that.

21:34.075 --> 21:36.382
Well, I'm just saying.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.427
It doesn't mean we're gonna
make it, though.

21:38.471 --> 21:41.996
Of course we're gonna make it.

21:42.039 --> 21:43.389
You sure?

21:43.432 --> 21:45.260
Of course.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.001
We're all gonna make it.

21:47.044 --> 21:49.917
Every single last one of us.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.833
We'll stick it out 'til the end
of this thing.

21:52.876 --> 21:55.444
I checked our supply levels.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.272
We're running low.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.405
If this keeps up
we're gonna run out.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.102
Fine.

22:01.145 --> 22:02.538
Ethan and I will go out,

22:02.582 --> 22:05.149

while the weather's good.

22:05.193 --> 22:06.194
Ok.

22:08.718 --> 22:11.895
Why don't you take Felix, too?

22:11.939 --> 22:14.420
Felix?

22:14.463 --> 22:16.378
No, he's a city guy.

22:16.422 --> 22:17.814
And he's not ready.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.512
Not after what
he's been through.

22:19.555 --> 22:20.600
We've all been through stuff.

22:20.643 --> 22:23.254
Not like him.
He's not ready.

22:23.298 --> 22:24.299
Ok.

22:28.738 --> 22:33.177
You know, we better get going
if we wanna leave by dawn.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.444
You know, you're right
about Felix.

22:38.487 --> 22:40.794
He is more damaged
than the others,

22:40.837 --> 22:44.841
which is exactly why we should
teach him to provide.

22:44.885 --> 22:47.322
What, 'cause it makes him feel
more like a man, right?

22:47.366 --> 22:50.107
Bring home the bacon, huh?

22:50.151 --> 22:51.718
You're really something,
you know that?

You are vampire.

24:00.047 --> 24:06.227
You must learn to be
what you are.

24:06.270 --> 24:07.533
What for?

24:07.576 --> 24:14.453
I will teach you to be
what you must be.

24:14.496 --> 24:15.671
What is that?

24:15.715 --> 24:18.457
It is who I am.

24:22.504 --> 24:29.511
This is where I found who I am,
long ago.

24:29.555 --> 24:32.079
Now you must do the same.

24:32.122 --> 24:33.733

That is why you must suffer.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.574
Time for the hunt.

25:40.016 --> 25:42.889
It's something primal.

25:42.932 --> 25:48.372
Something deep inside you,
a connection with everything.

25:48.416 --> 25:53.073
And it's important,
especially these days.

26:01.298 --> 26:03.823
Shh.

26:03.866 --> 26:04.911
What?

26:04.954 --> 26:07.087
You must learn patience.

26:07.130 --> 26:09.393
It takes practise.

She's also dinner
for your whole family.

26:34.593 --> 26:38.814
I don't wanna kill her.

26:38.858 --> 26:41.817
That's the trade in life.

26:41.861 --> 26:45.038
We appreciate all this beauty

26:45.081 --> 26:49.912
and then at the end of the day
we still gotta eat.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.261
But I'm hungry!

26:51.305 --> 26:56.919
We must hunt with power
and control.

26:58.094 --> 27:00.793
To own who you are.

27:12.369 --> 27:14.110
I don't like that trade.

27:14.154 --> 27:17.810
It's a sacred trade
as old as time itself.

You'll see.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.205
I'm not ready.

27:22.249 --> 27:25.252
You are ready.

27:25.295 --> 27:27.820
Just as ready as anyone.

27:38.265 --> 27:40.615
You wanna make sure you kill it.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.661
Wounding an animal
is a terrible thing.

27:45.533 --> 27:47.317
Easy.

28:01.027 --> 28:05.684
First, you pick a mouse.
One with heart, drive.

under control.

But then, out of nowhere, whack!

31:13.045 --> 31:17.745
The slayer's BFF cast her very
first spell and the boyfriend,

31:17.788 --> 31:19.051
he got his soul back.

31:19.094 --> 31:22.054
But isn't that a good thing?

31:22.097 --> 31:24.273
Getting back his soul
is what she wanted, right?

31:24.317 --> 31:25.535
You'd think.

31:25.579 --> 31:28.277
But it was actually
the worst thing ever,

31:28.321 --> 31:31.019
'cause even though his soul
was back in him

31:31.063 --> 31:34.893
the slayer had to kill him
anyways if she was gonna
save the world.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.069
So she does.
