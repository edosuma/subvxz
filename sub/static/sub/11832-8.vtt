WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:03.100
- Previously on "The Practice."

00:03.100 --> 00:06.180
- I'm not crazy about helping
the guy who killed my sister.

00:06.180 --> 00:08.029
- All we're asking

00:08.029 --> 00:09.200
is that you talk
about the Internet thing.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.110
- Boyfriend lives alone,
brother, big house.

00:12.110 --> 00:14.030
Why not Plan B them?

00:14.030 --> 00:15.220
- It might be worth a try.
- Give them a soft Plan B.

00:15.220 --> 00:17.020
- Plan B.
Soft.

00:17.020 --> 00:18.190
For both.

00:18.190 --> 00:20.090
- Did you murder your sister
and frame George Vogelman?

00:20.090 --> 00:22.010
- What?
- Objection!

00:22.010 --> 00:23.120
- Did you follow her to the bar,
then go to the motel?

00:23.120 --> 00:24.130
- That's sick!

00:24.130 --> 00:25.230
- You asked us to trust you.

00:30.020 --> 00:32.180
You just stole my son's
innocence.

00:32.180 --> 00:35.150
- I represent Steve Robin
and his dad.

00:35.150 --> 00:37.050
We're suing you.
- What?

00:37.050 --> 00:38.200
- Steve Robin?

00:38.200 --> 00:41.010
- Yeah, brother of the victim
in your Vogelman trial.

00:41.010 --> 00:43.000
Eugene accused him
of being the killer.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.160
I can paint a pretty
disgusting picture

00:44.160 --> 00:46.120
of you guys
in front of a jury.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.190
Team Plan B.
- You take us to court,

00:48.190 --> 00:50.070
and I promise you
we will be screaming,

00:50.070 --> 00:52.070
"He is the killer"
all over again.

00:52.070 --> 00:53.230
And in the court
of public opinion,

00:53.230 --> 00:55.120
he will be the killer.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.200
Now get your ass
out of this office

00:56.200 --> 00:58.070
and go tell your clients

00:58.070 --> 01:00.220
that truth is a complete defense
to defamation.

01:00.220 --> 01:03.070
- These are your scare tactics?

01:07.140 --> 01:10.020
- Eugene, Tommy Silva
agreed to depose you here.

01:10.020 --> 01:12.000
Probably so he doesn't have
to spring for the coffee,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.120
the skimp.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.120
I ordered a cake
for Rebecca's swearing-in party.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.030
- Oh, I'm sure
she'll be very surprised.

01:18.030 --> 01:19.220
- Oh, very.
She asked for chocolate.

01:19.220 --> 01:21.120
- I can't be worrying
about cakes now.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.200
Have you finished
with the pleadings folder?

01:22.200 --> 01:24.050
- In your bag.
- Are you sure

01:24.050 --> 01:25.170
you don't want somebody
to second chair?

01:25.170 --> 01:27.120
- No, it's just a burglary.
I can handle it.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.010
- Well, who's covering the depo?

01:29.010 --> 01:30.060
- Me,
but we really

01:30.060 --> 01:31.210
should be getting
outside counsel.

01:31.210 --> 01:34.020
- We will if it goes to trial,
but for discovery--

01:34.020 --> 01:36.010
- Fool for a client,
that's what they say.

01:36.010 --> 01:37.130
- Thank you, Lucy.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.090
- This will be a short
deposition, trust me.

01:39.090 --> 01:41.050
It's not like I'm gonna answer
anything.

01:41.050 --> 01:43.100
- Well, what if someone
goes for obstruction of justice?

01:43.100 --> 01:45.090
It's really in these days.

01:55.170 --> 01:58.050
- We can go right
into my office.

01:58.050 --> 02:00.230
- Hi, Lucy Hatcher.

02:00.230 --> 02:02.060
- Evelyn Mayfield.

02:02.060 --> 02:04.000
- I take it you've met Jimmy.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.030
I can introduce you
to the others later.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.150
That's the baby shaker, right?

02:17.150 --> 02:18.230
- Client, Lucy.

02:18.230 --> 02:20.220
Client.
- Right.

02:20.220 --> 02:24.040
The baby shaker client.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.050
Good handshake.

02:26.050 --> 02:27.050
Strong wrists.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.040
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

02:32.040 --> 02:40.020
♪ ♪

03:18.010 --> 03:19.170
- The results
of the psychiatric exam

03:19.170 --> 03:21.150
are supposed to be in
this afternoon.

03:21.150 --> 03:24.160
- And assuming she checks out,
they'll let her go.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.230
- Oh, no.

03:25.230 --> 03:27.120
- I passed the polygraph--

03:27.120 --> 03:28.220
- Lie detectors
aren't foolproof,

03:28.220 --> 03:30.080
as far as they're concerned.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.150
We discussed this.

03:31.150 --> 03:33.000
Plus, dead baby.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.150
They are not about
to just let you go.

03:35.150 --> 03:38.120
- Well, how about they arrest
the one who did it?

03:38.120 --> 03:40.030
I mean,
would they ever consider that?

03:40.030 --> 03:42.080
- Well, I'll know more
by the end of the day.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.130
For now--
- Remain calm, yes, I know.

03:45.130 --> 03:48.120
They accused me of killing
an 11-month-old child.

03:48.120 --> 03:53.030
But I should take it in stride,
I should just stay calm.

03:53.030 --> 03:55.000
- Their case is weak.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.080
The fact
that they gave you bail,

03:56.080 --> 03:58.160
they know their case is weak.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.200
Let's just ride this out.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.180
And yes, stay calm.

04:13.030 --> 04:15.020
- I was walking
towards the side entrance

04:15.020 --> 04:16.200
when I saw a man
exiting the warehouse

04:16.200 --> 04:18.180
with an armful
of laser disc players.

04:18.180 --> 04:20.110
- About how far
apart were you at the time?

04:20.110 --> 04:22.010
- About 7 or 8 yards.

04:22.010 --> 04:23.100
- And what happened next?

04:23.100 --> 04:25.030
- I called out for him to stop.

04:25.030 --> 04:27.180
He dropped what he was carrying
and ran towards the alley.

04:27.180 --> 04:29.090
We're instructed
not to put our lives

04:29.090 --> 04:30.200
on the line to protect property,

04:30.200 --> 04:32.140
so he got away.

04:32.140 --> 04:34.010
- How was the lighting
in this area?

04:34.010 --> 04:35.050
- There's a light
above the door.

04:35.050 --> 04:36.220
I got a very good look at him.

04:36.220 --> 04:38.110
- Do you see this man today?

04:38.110 --> 04:40.050
- He's the defendant.

04:40.050 --> 04:43.070
- How many laser disc players
was the burglar carrying?

04:43.070 --> 04:44.150
- Four.

04:44.150 --> 04:46.030
- Still in boxes?
- Yes, ma'am.

04:46.030 --> 04:48.010
- So his face was covered
when you saw him.

04:48.010 --> 04:50.090
Four boxes,

04:50.090 --> 04:52.020
each about 10 inches high,

04:52.020 --> 04:54.160
must have at least
partially covered his face.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.060
- But then he dropped them
when he ran.

04:57.060 --> 04:59.180
- He ran toward you?
- No, away.

04:59.180 --> 05:02.070
But there was a moment
before he ran, I caught a look.

05:02.070 --> 05:03.220
- A moment?

05:03.220 --> 05:06.020
- Seconds.
- Seconds?

05:06.020 --> 05:08.010
More than ten seconds?

05:08.010 --> 05:10.020
- No.
- More than five?

05:10.020 --> 05:11.170
- It was like two
or three seconds.

05:11.170 --> 05:13.090
- Two or three seconds--
- But I got a very good look--

05:13.090 --> 05:14.180
- There's no question
before you, ma'am.

05:14.180 --> 05:18.220
Move to strike.

05:18.220 --> 05:21.190
- Did you have any conversations
with Steve Robin

05:21.190 --> 05:22.220
prior to his testimony

05:22.220 --> 05:24.110
in the Vogelman murder trial?

05:24.110 --> 05:26.060
- Yes.

05:26.060 --> 05:29.100
- Did you discuss what questions
you would probably ask him?

05:29.100 --> 05:31.030
- Yes.
- Did you tell him

05:31.030 --> 05:33.010
that you planned
to accuse him in court

05:33.010 --> 05:34.060
as the one
who killed his sister?

05:34.060 --> 05:37.160
- Work product.
Don't answer.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.150
- At the time you were having
these discussions

05:39.150 --> 05:41.050
with Steve Robin,

05:41.050 --> 05:42.230
did you plan to accuse him
of killing his sister?

05:42.230 --> 05:44.040
- Work product.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.150
- All objections
have been waived.

05:45.150 --> 05:47.060
- Not on privilege, or--
- We got it on record.

05:47.060 --> 05:49.040
All objections, except
to the form of the question.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.120
- Of course we're not gonna
reveal internal--

05:50.120 --> 05:51.160
- We can get a court order--

05:51.160 --> 05:53.220
- Fine, do it.

05:53.220 --> 05:58.220
But for now, I'd just move on.

05:58.220 --> 06:00.130
- Are you familiar with the term

06:00.130 --> 06:03.210
"Plan B"?
- Work product.

06:03.210 --> 06:05.110
- I'm just asking
if he's familiar with the term.

06:05.110 --> 06:07.010
- And I answered.

06:07.010 --> 06:08.110
Work product.

06:08.110 --> 06:11.060
Move on.

06:11.060 --> 06:12.230
- When you accused Steve Robin

06:12.230 --> 06:16.020
in open court of possibly
being the one killed his sister,

06:16.020 --> 06:17.100
what facts did you rely on?

06:17.100 --> 06:18.090
- Work product.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.230
- This the way
we're gonna play it?

06:24.230 --> 06:28.010
- Sorry, off the record.

06:28.010 --> 06:29.220
You're suing us.

06:29.220 --> 06:35.150
You expect us to play nice?

06:35.150 --> 06:37.080
- Did she do it?
- Lucy...

06:37.080 --> 06:39.120
- Because I saw it on Court TV.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.220
And they did this reenactment,

06:40.220 --> 06:43.210
and she just shook
and shook and shook--

06:43.210 --> 06:45.180
- Lucy!

06:45.180 --> 06:47.050
- Come on, Bobby.

06:47.050 --> 06:49.210
Throw me a crumb.
Did she do it?

06:49.210 --> 06:52.040
- She didn't.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.180
- Because I saw it on Court TV.

06:54.180 --> 06:57.090
She just shook and shook and--

06:57.090 --> 06:59.210
- Lucy...

06:59.210 --> 07:01.160
- You should know
what people are saying.

07:06.230 --> 07:10.030
- We did okay, but it's close.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.030
I think you've got to testify.

07:12.030 --> 07:13.080
- But you said
if I take the stand,

07:13.080 --> 07:14.210
the D.A. can bring up my record.

07:14.210 --> 07:16.080
- Yeah, he can.

07:16.080 --> 07:19.010
- Well...

07:19.010 --> 07:20.120
if they find out
I got two priors,

07:20.120 --> 07:22.010
won't they think
I did this one?

07:22.010 --> 07:25.060
- They might,
but I don't see much choice.

07:25.060 --> 07:27.020
Okay,
how is it

07:27.020 --> 07:28.090
we can't find one witness

07:28.090 --> 07:29.220
that saw you
at the bar that night?

07:29.220 --> 07:31.140
- It was crowded,
and I only

07:31.140 --> 07:33.120
been there that one time.
Who's gonna remember?

07:33.120 --> 07:35.030
- Without a witness, it's
like you don't have an alibi.

07:38.010 --> 07:39.150
What?

07:39.150 --> 07:42.190
Russell, now is not the time
to be hiding things.

07:44.150 --> 07:47.060
- A buddy of mine was with me
at the bar that night.

07:47.060 --> 07:48.150
But...

07:48.150 --> 07:50.170
- But what?
- He's got a record.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.070
He don't want to get involved.

07:52.070 --> 07:53.220
- Russell, you are looking
at a conviction here.

07:53.220 --> 07:55.200
Third time.
It'll mean jail.

07:55.200 --> 07:59.170
If he really is a buddy,
he's got to come forward.

08:06.010 --> 08:07.220
- How'd he find out
we call it Plan B?

08:07.220 --> 08:09.200
- It's not exactly
a trade secret.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.000
We're kind of famous for it.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.090
- He's going for a court order?

08:12.090 --> 08:13.150
- Lindsay
basically answered

08:13.150 --> 08:15.020
"work product"
to every question.

08:15.020 --> 08:16.110
- It was work product.

08:16.110 --> 08:17.170
- Well, be armed
with the research,

08:17.170 --> 08:19.230
because Papp
hates discovery motions.

08:19.230 --> 08:22.230
- We'll be ready.
- Look, look, look.

08:22.230 --> 08:25.050
- Mayfield
could begin this month.

08:25.050 --> 08:28.090
Sources say that they're
far apart from any deal.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.100
You'll remember
Miss Mayfield is charged

08:30.100 --> 08:31.110
with shaking to death

08:31.110 --> 08:33.000
an 11-month-old child

08:33.000 --> 08:35.059
that was entrusted to her care.

08:35.059 --> 08:37.020
Turning to the--

08:37.020 --> 08:39.059
- What's the deal on her?
- I think she's innocent.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.150
- Oh, come on.

08:40.150 --> 08:42.110
All this church stuff
she's into?

08:42.110 --> 08:45.070
Nobody could be that Christian
without being a little vicious.

08:45.070 --> 08:47.010
- Do you ever
say anything thoughtful?

08:47.010 --> 08:49.160
- Look, all I'm saying
is she had very strong wrists

08:49.160 --> 08:50.220
for a babysitter.

08:50.220 --> 08:53.070
Whether that passes
for thoughtful,

08:53.070 --> 08:55.010
you be the judge.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.010
- So, you guys
were together the whole night?

09:01.010 --> 09:02.180
- Yeah.
- At a bar

09:02.180 --> 09:04.130
called Little Freddie's
from 11:00 till closing?

09:04.130 --> 09:06.080
- Yeah, that's right.
- I'm a little curious

09:06.080 --> 09:08.010
why you didn't
come forward before.

09:08.010 --> 09:10.000
I mean, this is your best friend
we're talking about.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.120
Now, I understand
you have a record--

09:11.120 --> 09:15.000
- Ms. Washington,
I've got a decent job.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.020
If it got out that...

09:20.020 --> 09:24.010
It was a sexual assault
conviction in '92.

09:24.010 --> 09:27.110
Back in New York
under another name.

09:27.110 --> 09:28.150
- What'd you do?

09:28.150 --> 09:30.150
- They say I raped a girl.

09:30.150 --> 09:31.190
Anyway, let's just
say I don't need

09:31.190 --> 09:34.090
that coming to light, you know?

09:34.090 --> 09:36.140
- Okay, I understand.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.090
But Russell needs you.

09:39.090 --> 09:41.000
This is your friend.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.200
He will go to prison.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.090
- Will they find out
about my conviction?

09:46.090 --> 09:48.130
- It's a small case.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.230
The odds are, they aren't gonna
do a big background check

09:50.230 --> 09:53.140
on some burglary trial.

09:53.140 --> 09:58.020
But there is a chance, yes.

09:58.020 --> 09:59.070
- Leaving in about 20 minutes.

09:59.070 --> 10:00.080
You need anything else?

10:04.180 --> 10:05.190
- No.

10:05.190 --> 10:08.050
- Okay, 'night.

10:14.140 --> 10:17.140
Rebecca?
- Huh?

10:17.140 --> 10:20.000
Oh, 'night.

10:26.130 --> 10:28.040
Okay.

10:38.190 --> 10:42.040
- Eugene, Bobby,
I think I may have a problem.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.200
- What?

10:43.200 --> 10:47.120
- My client, I mean my trial,
you know the burglary?

10:47.120 --> 10:49.190
Russell Thurm?
- Yeah.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.230
- I think he's a serial killer.
- Really?

10:51.230 --> 10:53.180
- Excuse me?
- I mean, I can't be sure.

10:53.180 --> 10:55.150
But, I mean, I think.

10:55.150 --> 10:58.010
- What's going on?
- Rebecca's client's a murderer.

10:58.010 --> 10:59.130
- Close the door.

10:59.130 --> 11:00.140
- I think he's one
of the harbor stranglers

11:00.140 --> 11:02.110
everybody's talking about.

11:02.110 --> 11:04.170
- Who?
- My client.

11:04.170 --> 11:07.170
I just got finished meeting
with his alibi witness.

11:07.170 --> 11:09.210
I told Russell
that we needed a witness.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.120
And he told me
that he was in a bar

11:11.120 --> 11:13.070
with this other guy, Ronzoni,
who I just met with.

11:13.070 --> 11:15.080
- Slow down.
- Okay.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.210
This Ronzoni, I think
he's the other serial killer.

11:18.210 --> 11:19.230
I saw his arm.

11:19.230 --> 11:21.190
- Well, what did he tell you?

11:21.190 --> 11:23.030
- Well,
he didn't tell me anything.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.200
What, do you think
he's gonna tell?

11:24.200 --> 11:26.040
You don't go around admitting
you are a serial killer.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.090
I mean,
he's not some serial confessor.

11:27.090 --> 11:29.200
- Rebecca, slow down?

11:29.200 --> 11:31.230
- Okay, okay.

11:31.230 --> 11:36.050
Ronzoni has a tattoo
of dice right there.

11:36.050 --> 11:38.000
It's in all the papers.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.220
One of the harbor stranglers
has a dice tattoo on his arm.

11:40.220 --> 11:42.170
- Yeah, that's true.
I've heard that.

11:42.170 --> 11:45.090
- And he also has a sexual
assault conviction.

11:45.090 --> 11:46.170
He raped a girl.

11:46.170 --> 11:47.220
- That doesn't mean--
- No, no.

11:47.220 --> 11:49.080
August 14th,
Russell

11:49.080 --> 11:50.190
and Ronzoni are at a bar

11:50.190 --> 11:52.060
on Franklin
till 2:00 in the morning.

11:52.060 --> 11:54.010
Michelle Cummings,
the prostitute,

11:54.010 --> 11:55.130
was killed that night.

11:55.130 --> 11:56.160
Now, I looked it up.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.130
She was last seen around 2:00

11:58.130 --> 12:00.130
on the corner
of 18th and Franklin,

12:00.130 --> 12:02.090
which is just three blocks
from the bar.

12:02.090 --> 12:03.200
Now, I've got rapist

12:03.200 --> 12:05.110
with a tattoo
near the scene of the crime.

12:05.110 --> 12:07.040
You're gonna tell me
that doesn't add up?

12:07.040 --> 12:08.230
I mean, now we know he didn't
knock off a video store.

12:08.230 --> 12:10.080
He was busy killing somebody.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.170
So do we call the police?
- Well...

12:12.170 --> 12:14.010
- They're serial killers!
- Hold on.

12:14.010 --> 12:16.110
Unless someone
is in immediate danger--

12:16.110 --> 12:17.140
- There is!
- Who?

12:17.140 --> 12:19.000
- Any young girl, that's who.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.190
- I don't think
you can reasonably

12:20.190 --> 12:22.130
believe someone's in danger

12:22.130 --> 12:25.030
unless you first know that
these are the serial killers.

12:25.030 --> 12:27.010
And just on the tattoo--

12:27.010 --> 12:28.220
- Even if they are, who's to say
they're gonna do it again?

12:28.220 --> 12:30.000
- Of course
they're gonna do it again!

12:30.000 --> 12:31.150
They're serial killers.

12:31.150 --> 12:32.210
That's why they're called
serial killers:

12:32.210 --> 12:35.200
they keep doing it.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.060
- What do you think?

12:37.060 --> 12:38.130
- Well, if you knew
these were the guys,

12:38.130 --> 12:39.230
that would be one thing, maybe.
But--

12:39.230 --> 12:41.150
- Why don't we
just turn in Ronzoni?

12:41.150 --> 12:42.230
He's not my client.

12:42.230 --> 12:45.110
- You'll end up
implicating Russell.

12:45.110 --> 12:47.050
- Did you read what they did
to those girls?

12:50.230 --> 12:52.110
- I'm not sure
we can do anything yet.

12:52.110 --> 12:54.030
- Bobby,
how can we not do anything?

12:54.030 --> 12:55.140
- All you've got is a belief

12:55.140 --> 12:57.190
that your client
and his alibi witness

12:57.190 --> 12:59.170
are bad guys.

12:59.170 --> 13:00.230
- So I do nothing?

13:03.090 --> 13:05.030
- You defend your client.

13:11.010 --> 13:13.010
- Asking them
what they believed at the time

13:13.010 --> 13:14.140
is not invading work product.

13:14.140 --> 13:16.130
- Of course it is,
when our beliefs are based

13:16.130 --> 13:18.180
on internal discussions
made between each other.

13:18.180 --> 13:21.020
- Take a look at the transcript
of the deposition, Judge.

13:21.020 --> 13:22.110
They wouldn't answer anything.

13:22.110 --> 13:24.130
They also asserted
"work product"

13:24.130 --> 13:27.030
to almost every request
we made for document production.

13:27.030 --> 13:29.020
- Documents that were generated
in preparation--

13:29.020 --> 13:31.120
- That's not gonna fly,
Ms. Dole.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.080
You're not gonna sweep
everything under work product.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.160
- Well,
all this stuff

13:34.160 --> 13:36.160
falls under our strategy
in defending--

13:36.160 --> 13:39.080
- Yeah, and it's your strategy
that you're being sued for.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.140
- You can't pierce work product.

13:40.140 --> 13:42.000
If you could, then--

13:42.000 --> 13:44.010
- Look, this is a simple cause
of action.

13:44.010 --> 13:45.040
He's saying
that you didn't have

13:45.040 --> 13:46.100
a good faith belief

13:46.100 --> 13:47.150
for pointing your finger
at the brother.

13:47.150 --> 13:49.060
He's entitled to explore that.

13:49.060 --> 13:50.170
- It isn't that simple.
If you allow lawyers to--

13:50.170 --> 13:53.020
- I'm making it that simple.

13:53.020 --> 13:55.200
Now, you answer all
of these questions truthfully,

13:55.200 --> 13:57.130
completely,

13:57.130 --> 13:59.170
or I'll enter a judgment
for the plaintiff right now.

14:04.030 --> 14:05.150
- I'd appeal it right now.
Get it certified to SJC.

14:05.150 --> 14:06.190
- And if we lose,
then we're right back

14:06.190 --> 14:08.100
before this guy...
- Hold on.

14:08.100 --> 14:10.020
- Who will be even more angry
than he already is.

14:10.020 --> 14:11.110
- You weren't afraid
of pissing off Judge Hiller

14:11.110 --> 14:12.180
in the Pearson trial.

14:12.180 --> 14:13.210
- That was after the verdict,
Ellenor.

14:13.210 --> 14:15.090
This guy's the trial judge.

14:15.090 --> 14:17.000
- We can't be answering
questions about Plan B.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.050
- We can't be going into trial
with a judge

14:18.050 --> 14:19.100
who is biased against us.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.080
- We're dead.
- Table it.

14:24.220 --> 14:27.030
- Hey, guys.

14:27.030 --> 14:28.050
Look.

14:28.050 --> 14:30.060
I know this sounds self-serving

14:30.060 --> 14:32.090
or like I'm trying
to have it both ways.

14:32.090 --> 14:34.090
The truth is,
I really don't like

14:34.090 --> 14:37.100
suing other lawyers,
especially a small firm.

14:37.100 --> 14:41.060
I feel like we're
from the same club.

14:41.060 --> 14:42.200
That aside,
I am suing you,

14:42.200 --> 14:45.070
and you guys
face some serious exposure;

14:45.070 --> 14:48.000
not just moneywise,
but public relations too.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.010
Be smart.

14:49.010 --> 14:50.190
Settle this.

14:50.190 --> 14:54.230
I won't push for anything
beyond your policy limit.

14:54.230 --> 14:57.100
You know I'm right.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.230
Let's not be silly.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.200
- Me?

15:07.200 --> 15:09.090
- We've given it a lot
of thought, and--

15:09.090 --> 15:11.060
- Oh, isn't this just a little
too incestuous?

15:11.060 --> 15:13.230
I've slept with Bobby Donnell,
my roommate is Lindsay Dole.

15:13.230 --> 15:15.140
- And you've gone up
against them before, so--

15:15.140 --> 15:18.000
- Yes, which has never proven
to be a very good idea.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.110
- I know it's asking a lot,
but there's a lot of heat here.

15:20.110 --> 15:22.100
Dead babies make good copy.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.140
- Do you know how much
of a personal life I have?

15:24.140 --> 15:25.220
Lindsay's my best friend.

15:25.220 --> 15:27.160
Bobby's a friend too.
Even--

15:27.160 --> 15:29.100
- They just sandbagged you
in open court.

15:29.100 --> 15:31.070
How can you--
- That was Ellenor Frutt.

15:31.070 --> 15:32.070
- Helen...

15:36.100 --> 15:38.070
You, better than anybody,
know this firm.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.030
You're the only D.A.
we have that seems

15:40.030 --> 15:42.020
to be able to beat them.

15:42.020 --> 15:44.020
We need you.

15:44.020 --> 15:46.000
The case wobbles as it is.

15:51.010 --> 15:53.090
- I tendered his name as soon
as I became aware of him.

15:53.090 --> 15:54.210
- It's unfair surprise,
Your Honor.

15:54.210 --> 15:56.150
- There's no real surprise,
Your Honor.

15:56.150 --> 15:58.190
This witness corroborates
my client's alibi, which--

15:58.190 --> 16:00.200
- The defendant
obviously feels he's losing,

16:00.200 --> 16:02.180
so he found someone
to lie for him.

16:02.180 --> 16:06.020
- I don't understand why,
if this is your client's friend,

16:06.020 --> 16:08.230
you didn't know
about him any sooner.

16:08.230 --> 16:10.040
- Your Honor, as soon

16:10.040 --> 16:12.040
as I became aware
of this witness,

16:12.040 --> 16:13.140
as soon as I had the opportunity

16:13.140 --> 16:15.230
to talk with him,
I tendered his name.

16:15.230 --> 16:18.000
- [sighs]

16:18.000 --> 16:19.150
I'll cut you a little slack
this time.

16:19.150 --> 16:22.000
I'll grant a continuance
until 9:00 tomorrow

16:22.000 --> 16:23.130
so you can prepare
for the witness.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.180
[dog barks]

16:28.180 --> 16:30.070
- Andrew, come get your jacket,
honey.

16:30.070 --> 16:31.160
Elizabeth, don't touch that,
now.

16:31.160 --> 16:33.160
Here.
Put your jacket on.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.170
Guys, take the pumpkin bread
to Mr. Kelly, one each.

16:36.170 --> 16:38.000
Thank you.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.180
Bye-bye.

16:46.010 --> 16:48.010
- The report was not great.

16:48.010 --> 16:49.150
- What do you mean?

16:49.150 --> 16:54.150
- The psychiatrist
thinks you could be in denial.

16:54.150 --> 16:55.220
- What?

16:55.220 --> 16:57.070
- He makes room
for the possibility

16:57.070 --> 16:58.200
that you don't even have
a memory of it;

16:58.200 --> 17:00.120
that's why you passed
a polygraph.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.220
- [scoffs]

17:01.220 --> 17:05.160
He's saying
that I committed a murder,

17:05.160 --> 17:08.089
but I don't have
a memory of it?

17:08.089 --> 17:09.210
- It was a court ordered report.

17:09.210 --> 17:11.040
It can't be introduced,

17:11.040 --> 17:13.040
so I'm not even
worried about it.

17:13.040 --> 17:17.119
But it doesn't encourage
the D.A. to let you go, either.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.010
Speaking of which,

17:19.010 --> 17:21.099
we just got a little bit
more bad news there too.

17:21.099 --> 17:24.060
Helen Gamble
will be prosecuting.

17:24.060 --> 17:25.130
- Who's Helen Gamble?

17:25.130 --> 17:28.030
- One of their best
on homicides.

17:28.030 --> 17:30.100
She and I
also used to be involved.

17:30.100 --> 17:32.070
She lives with another lawyer
at my firm.

17:32.070 --> 17:33.230
She knows us all very well.

17:33.230 --> 17:36.050
I suspect that's why
she's been put on.

17:36.050 --> 17:38.130
But it's not all bad.

17:38.130 --> 17:40.030
I know her style too.

17:40.030 --> 17:43.010
- You've tried cases
against her before?

17:43.010 --> 17:47.110
- Several times.
- Who usually wins?

17:47.110 --> 17:49.170
- It comes down more
to the facts than the lawyers.

17:49.170 --> 17:50.230
- So she usually wins?

17:50.230 --> 17:52.160
- Their case
is very circumstantial,

17:52.160 --> 17:55.150
and since you were
the last one with the baby--

17:55.150 --> 17:57.020
- The father did it.

17:57.020 --> 17:58.230
People have seen him be abusive.
He--

17:58.230 --> 18:03.110
- But Kevin was with you
when he stopped breathing.

18:03.110 --> 18:05.040
It may not be proof you did it,

18:05.040 --> 18:07.070
but it sure as hell
gives reasonable doubt

18:07.070 --> 18:08.170
to the father.

18:12.010 --> 18:14.170
- That's why they are
prosecuting me, isn't it?

18:14.170 --> 18:17.060
The public wants a conviction,

18:17.060 --> 18:19.000
and I'm the only one
they can get.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.020
- It's possible.

18:32.030 --> 18:33.090
I want you to talk
to everybody.

18:33.090 --> 18:34.090
Anybody who knows her.

18:34.090 --> 18:35.170
Our whole defense might be,

18:35.170 --> 18:37.140
"It's not in her character."
- Okay.

18:37.140 --> 18:39.040
- Ellenor, I'd like you to go
for the medical,

18:39.040 --> 18:40.080
see if anything is unanswered.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.230
Pre-existing conditions--

18:41.230 --> 18:43.130
- The cause of death
isn't in question, Bobby.

18:43.130 --> 18:45.030
The autopsy is--
- I don't want to assume that.

18:45.030 --> 18:46.220
If the autopsy
is accurate, fine.

18:46.220 --> 18:50.150
But let's not be giving them
the benefit of the doubt.

18:50.150 --> 18:53.070
- Is it just me,
or is this a perfect Plan B?

18:53.070 --> 18:55.000
We've got an abusive father

18:55.000 --> 18:56.160
and we're just running scared
because we got sued.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.040
- Nobody's running scared.

18:58.040 --> 19:01.130
We'll go after the father
if we have to.

19:01.130 --> 19:03.040
What's the deal on the other?

19:03.040 --> 19:04.130
- Eugene's depo
resumes tomorrow.

19:04.130 --> 19:06.000
- 2:00.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.080
- May I make a very
unpopular suggestion?

19:07.080 --> 19:08.210
- Forget it.

19:08.210 --> 19:10.160
- If we were representing
another firm being sued

19:10.160 --> 19:12.150
for this, we would absolutely
be recommending settlement.

19:12.150 --> 19:14.110
- It's not another firm.
It's us.

19:14.110 --> 19:16.030
- Our policy
limit is $1.5 million.

19:16.030 --> 19:18.090
Suppose a jury slaps us
with a $3 million judgment.

19:18.090 --> 19:20.110
It's not just everything
in this office we lose.

19:20.110 --> 19:22.010
We're named personally.

19:22.010 --> 19:23.170
They'll take our cars,
our refrigerators--

19:23.170 --> 19:25.200
- If we settle this,
it's an admission of liability.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.080
There will be headlines
in every legal publication.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.000
- That's not true.
- It is true, Lindsay.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.170
And on principle,
how do we cave?

19:31.170 --> 19:33.140
- Forget principle,
I'm talking about surviving--

19:33.140 --> 19:35.120
- Which we won't do
without principle.

19:35.120 --> 19:37.000
Now, the practice
of law may only amount

19:37.000 --> 19:38.150
to a conference table to you.

19:38.150 --> 19:39.220
With me, it's more.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.120
- All right.
- Who are you kidding?

19:41.120 --> 19:43.000
You stood up in open court

19:43.000 --> 19:44.170
and accused a brother
of killing his sister?

19:44.170 --> 19:46.010
You're gonna claim
the high road?

19:46.010 --> 19:47.150
- We all agreed
to Plan B the guy.

19:47.150 --> 19:48.170
- A soft Plan B.

19:48.170 --> 19:50.040
He went for the throat.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.190
Now we're getting sued.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.150
You not only owe an apology
to that kid,

19:53.150 --> 19:54.210
you owe one
to the rest of us here

19:54.210 --> 19:56.130
who you put at risk.
- Hey, Lindsay,

19:56.130 --> 19:58.020
you're the one who first told us
to go after the brother.

19:58.020 --> 19:59.140
- Not like that, I didn't.

19:59.140 --> 20:02.000
I said raise the question.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.040
A jury's gonna kill us.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.060
- All right, that'll do.

20:06.230 --> 20:08.100
At a minimum,
Lindsay

20:08.100 --> 20:11.010
may be right
about outside counsel.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.230
I'm gonna look
to bring somebody else in.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.170
- Should I send it back?

20:23.170 --> 20:25.230
I mean,
it was supposed to be chocolate.

20:25.230 --> 20:28.200
This is German chocolate.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.210
Puke.

20:29.210 --> 20:32.110
- Will she care?

20:32.110 --> 20:34.070
- Jimmy, it's got coconut bits.

20:34.070 --> 20:36.000
- It's just a cake, Lucy.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.040
- How often does a person
get sworn in to be a lawyer?

20:39.040 --> 20:41.030
You know, this is a big thing,
Jimmy.

20:41.030 --> 20:42.170
You don't celebrate big things

20:42.170 --> 20:45.100
with German puke
coconut bit chocolate.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.140
[door squeaks, clatters shut]

20:48.110 --> 20:49.210
Serial killer.

20:49.210 --> 20:50.200
I'm on break.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.150
- Can I help you?

20:54.150 --> 20:57.130
- Uh, yeah, I'm looking
for a Rebecca Washington.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.110
- Mr. Ronzoni.
- Yeah.

20:59.110 --> 21:01.160
Look, I'm having some
second thoughts about this.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.110
Can't I do this, like,
by affidavit or--

21:03.110 --> 21:06.030
- I don't think you can.
- Suppose they dig up my record?

21:06.030 --> 21:07.150
- You've already done your time
for that.

21:07.150 --> 21:11.060
They can't do anything.

21:11.060 --> 21:13.070
Look, I will just ask you
a few questions,

21:13.070 --> 21:14.090
keep it short.

21:16.110 --> 21:19.020
- What questions exactly?

21:19.020 --> 21:21.110
- Do you recall
where you were on August 14th

21:21.110 --> 21:23.000
at 1:30 in the morning?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.010
- Uh, yeah.

21:24.010 --> 21:25.130
I was at Little Freddie's,

21:25.130 --> 21:28.110
a bar on Franklin
near the corner of 15th.

21:28.110 --> 21:30.220
- Did anyone accompany you
to the bar that night?

21:30.220 --> 21:33.080
- Yes.
Russell Thurm.

21:33.080 --> 21:38.030
We arrived together around 11:00
and left together about 2:00.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.120
- From 11:00
till 2:00,

21:39.120 --> 21:42.090
were you ever
apart from Mr. Thurm?

21:42.090 --> 21:44.210
- Other than a couple minutes
for a bathroom run, no.

21:44.210 --> 21:46.120
- Well, how can you be sure
that it was

21:46.120 --> 21:48.150
August 14th
that you were together?

21:48.150 --> 21:51.180
- Well, I have
a credit card receipt.

21:51.180 --> 21:56.210
- Is this the receipt
you are referring to?

21:56.210 --> 21:59.080
- Yeah.
- Mark and identify, Your Honor?

21:59.080 --> 22:00.200
- Mark exhibit seven.

22:00.200 --> 22:04.050
- Could you please read
the highlighted portion?

22:04.050 --> 22:07.140
- Little Freddie's, $31.78.

22:07.140 --> 22:11.070
Peter T. Ronzoni,
August 14th, 1998.

22:11.070 --> 22:14.140
1:57 a.m.

22:14.140 --> 22:17.040
- Thank you.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.130
- Russell Thurm's name

22:18.130 --> 22:20.110
appears nowhere
on this receipt, does it?

22:20.110 --> 22:22.080
- Why would his name
be on my receipt?

22:22.080 --> 22:24.000
- So all the receipt
proves

22:24.000 --> 22:25.130
is that you were in the bar
that night, doesn't it?

22:25.130 --> 22:27.060
- Objection.
- Sustained.

22:27.060 --> 22:29.180
- You consider Russell Thurm
a friend?

22:29.180 --> 22:30.190
- Yeah.

22:30.190 --> 22:32.130
- A good friend?
- I guess.

22:32.130 --> 22:33.180
- You don't want
to see your good friend

22:33.180 --> 22:35.020
go to jail, do you?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.170
- No.

22:36.170 --> 22:38.100
- You stayed in that bar
until 2:00, huh?

22:38.100 --> 22:40.200
- Yes.
- Didn't leave before closing?

22:40.200 --> 22:42.000
- Right.

22:43.160 --> 22:44.140
- Right.

22:56.170 --> 22:58.070
- I really appreciate
you talking to me.

22:58.070 --> 23:00.140
- You know, Mr. Berluti,
my entire congregation

23:00.140 --> 23:03.030
would have been here
if you had asked them.

23:03.030 --> 23:05.010
- You don't think
Evelyn could have done this?

23:05.010 --> 23:07.120
- It's beyond any possibility.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.050
I won't throw
around the "saint" word,

23:09.050 --> 23:11.190
but Evelyn Mayfield
is not only a gentle woman,

23:11.190 --> 23:14.190
she's one of the most loving.

23:14.190 --> 23:16.060
She's probably
babysat the children

23:16.060 --> 23:19.110
of over half the congregation.

23:19.110 --> 23:23.050
- Nobody's ever complained
that she had a temper or,

23:23.050 --> 23:24.070
you know,

23:24.070 --> 23:26.050
used corporal punishment?

23:26.050 --> 23:27.200
- No.

23:27.200 --> 23:31.180
Mr. Berluti, they're still
calling her to babysit.

23:31.180 --> 23:34.140
Now, I may not be the world's
best judge of character,

23:34.140 --> 23:38.080
but they've got
the wrong person.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.120
- You know the father
of the victim.

23:40.120 --> 23:43.080
- I do.
He's in the congregation.

23:43.080 --> 23:45.200
- You think
he could have done this?

23:45.200 --> 23:48.040
- I really don't feel
comfortable commenting on that.

23:51.170 --> 23:53.200
- We saw that he was
basically unaccounted for

23:53.200 --> 23:55.170
at the time of the crime.

23:55.170 --> 23:57.040
That raised suspicion.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.050
- Did you have any evidence
of Steve Robin

23:59.050 --> 24:01.110
having a history of violence?
- No, but that doesn't mean--

24:01.110 --> 24:03.120
- The answer
to the question was no.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.090
- Doesn't mean what?

24:05.090 --> 24:06.220
- The answer was no.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.080
- Are you familiar with the term
"Plan B"?

24:14.210 --> 24:16.040
- This is work product.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.140
- If we go back
before the judge--

24:17.140 --> 24:18.230
- I don't want
to be giving this--

24:18.230 --> 24:24.090
- Just give the answer
we discussed.

24:24.090 --> 24:26.170
- Yes, I'm familiar
with the term.

24:26.170 --> 24:29.120
- Could you define it, please?

24:29.120 --> 24:31.030
- Sometimes,
when we have clients

24:31.030 --> 24:32.170
we feel did not commit the crime

24:32.170 --> 24:35.010
with which he or she is charged,

24:35.010 --> 24:37.150
instead of simply aiming
to establish reasonable doubt,

24:37.150 --> 24:39.090
which we would consider plan A,

24:39.090 --> 24:41.050
we endeavor to raise
the possibility

24:41.050 --> 24:42.190
of perhaps another suspect

24:42.190 --> 24:44.090
who had motive and opportunity

24:44.090 --> 24:46.090
to commit the crime.

24:46.090 --> 24:48.040
We call that "Plan B."

24:48.040 --> 24:52.140
- You point the finger
at somebody else?

24:52.140 --> 24:53.230
- Yes.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.120
- And in the Vogelman trial,

24:55.120 --> 24:57.140
you pointed the finger
at Steve Robin.

24:57.140 --> 24:59.150
- We raised the question
as to his motive

24:59.150 --> 25:04.140
and opportunity.

25:04.140 --> 25:08.000
- It went okay.
I think we have a good shot.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.150
- What happens next?

25:09.150 --> 25:11.080
- Closing arguments;
then we wait for the verdict.

25:11.080 --> 25:13.080
- Well, I don't got to be here
for any of that, right?

25:13.080 --> 25:14.190
- No.

25:14.190 --> 25:15.200
Hello?

25:20.010 --> 25:22.040
What?

25:22.040 --> 25:24.120
- I taped as much as I could.

25:24.120 --> 25:27.010
- Annie Shaw is believed
to be the tenth victim

25:27.010 --> 25:29.220
of the now infamous
harbor stranglers.

25:29.220 --> 25:32.150
At 15, she would also
be the youngest victim

25:32.150 --> 25:34.130
of these grisly killers.

25:34.130 --> 25:36.090
Though police
are releasing few details

25:36.090 --> 25:38.170
at this hour, we do know this.

25:38.170 --> 25:41.210
Her naked body was found
by a homeless man on Tuesday.

25:41.210 --> 25:45.030
At this hour, it appears
Ms. Shaw was abducted

25:45.030 --> 25:49.200
while walking home
from a friend's house.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.140
- It doesn't change anything,
Beck.

25:51.140 --> 25:52.210
- It doesn't change anything?

25:52.210 --> 25:54.150
Bobby, they just
killed somebody else.

25:54.150 --> 25:56.090
- You don't know it was them.

25:56.090 --> 25:58.030
You don't know
they're the killers.

25:58.030 --> 26:00.050
You don't know they're gonna
hurt somebody else.

26:00.050 --> 26:02.060
You have no legal right
to do anything.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.030
- Legal?
What about moral right?

26:04.030 --> 26:05.140
- That oath
you're about to take tomorrow

26:05.140 --> 26:06.160
has nothing to do
with moral rights.

26:06.160 --> 26:08.010
- Oh, please.

26:08.010 --> 26:09.090
Spoken just like a true
defense attorney.

26:09.090 --> 26:10.220
- Which you are on this case.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.130
[sighs]

26:15.130 --> 26:16.130
Sit.

26:24.040 --> 26:26.170
This is the worst part

26:26.170 --> 26:29.210
of the job, Rebecca.

26:29.210 --> 26:32.120
But it does go with the job.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.040
I know you know,

26:34.040 --> 26:35.120
'cause you've seen
me and Eugene

26:35.120 --> 26:36.230
and everybody here

26:36.230 --> 26:40.140
agonize over
this same kind of situation.

26:40.140 --> 26:42.220
The reason
you're so frustrated is...

26:46.070 --> 26:50.050
is because you know
you don't have a choice.

26:55.090 --> 26:56.210
- My feeling is,

26:56.210 --> 26:58.140
she's very much
the wonderful person they claim.

26:58.140 --> 27:00.190
- A wonderful person
who shook a baby to death.

27:00.190 --> 27:03.000
- Well, that's why I think
denial is possible.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.030
It would be unconscionable
to hurt a child.

27:05.030 --> 27:07.140
Inconceivable
to her that she could hurt him.

27:07.140 --> 27:10.150
So if she snapped,
she may have blocked it out.

27:10.150 --> 27:12.090
- Mm, I'm hearing
too many "if"s.

27:12.090 --> 27:14.050
I'm not walking into court
with "if."

27:14.050 --> 27:16.120
Did she do this or not?

27:16.120 --> 27:18.170
- I'm not saying she did it.
You're saying she did.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.010
- What's going on?

27:20.010 --> 27:21.120
- Did you not find
she was in denial?

27:21.120 --> 27:23.080
- You asked me
to evaluate this person

27:23.080 --> 27:25.070
to determine if she was
psychologically capable of--

27:25.070 --> 27:27.180
- We asked you
in your professional opinion

27:27.180 --> 27:29.050
if she committed the crime.

27:29.050 --> 27:30.150
- Well, that's ridiculous
to ask me.

27:30.150 --> 27:31.220
That--I don't know the facts.

27:31.220 --> 27:34.230
- All right. All right.
Hold on.

27:34.230 --> 27:37.010
If you don't think she did it,

27:37.010 --> 27:39.050
how the hell do you find
her to be in denial?

27:39.050 --> 27:40.140
- Look, Ms. Gamble,
I don't need--

27:40.140 --> 27:44.030
- All right, doctor,
just tell us.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.130
- I found a pattern
of denial with her.

27:46.130 --> 27:49.040
When she's pushed, she retreats
into God and her religion.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.230
There were certain memory lapses
she couldn't account for.

27:51.230 --> 27:55.040
But I don't think she was lying.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.000
- I'm very confused here.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.100
- The baby died in her custody.

27:58.100 --> 27:59.190
There are things
she didn't remember.

27:59.190 --> 28:04.070
My suspicion
is her memory is blocked,

28:04.070 --> 28:08.050
and she's the one blocking it.

28:08.050 --> 28:12.090
- I want to offer manslaughter.

28:12.090 --> 28:14.030
- Go ahead.

28:16.050 --> 28:18.050
[knocking at door]

28:18.050 --> 28:19.080
- Come in.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.110
Ms. Washington?

28:28.100 --> 28:30.000
- I'd like to withdraw
from the case.

28:31.220 --> 28:33.080
- [sighs]

28:33.080 --> 28:34.120
On what grounds?

28:34.120 --> 28:36.070
- Irreconcilable differences.

28:36.070 --> 28:38.020
- You're gonna
have to do better.

28:41.130 --> 28:43.030
- Hypothetically,

28:43.030 --> 28:45.050
let's just say
a lawyer has reason

28:45.050 --> 28:48.120
to believe his client
is a serial killer.

28:48.120 --> 28:52.190
Would that be legal cause?

28:52.190 --> 28:54.180
- Is your client
asking you to commit a crime

28:54.180 --> 28:57.060
or fraud?
- No, but--

28:57.060 --> 29:00.170
- Your request
to withdraw is denied.

29:00.170 --> 29:03.190
- Hypothetically, what
if he's about to commit a crime.

29:03.190 --> 29:05.180
- You have knowledge of that?

29:05.180 --> 29:07.220
- Well, not specific knowledge,
but common sense.

29:07.220 --> 29:10.180
- Common sense?

29:10.180 --> 29:13.120
You you realize you violated
your ethical obligations

29:13.120 --> 29:15.030
coming in here with this?

29:15.030 --> 29:17.070
- You asked
whether I have legal cause.

29:17.070 --> 29:19.040
I just posed a hypothetical.

29:19.040 --> 29:23.050
- Counsel, I'm going to give you
the benefit of intelligence

29:23.050 --> 29:27.010
and assume that you knew
before you walked in here

29:27.010 --> 29:29.020
that you didn't have cause.

29:29.020 --> 29:32.080
- Look, if a client doesn't pay,

29:32.080 --> 29:34.080
that's legal cause to withdraw.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.110
I figured something
a little more serious,

29:36.110 --> 29:38.200
like rape or murder,
might qualify too.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.040
- Yes,
and you figured

29:40.040 --> 29:41.190
if you couched it
as a hypothetical

29:41.190 --> 29:44.100
you could make an end run
around the legal ethics

29:44.100 --> 29:46.110
and that maybe I would pass
on the information

29:46.110 --> 29:47.170
to the police.

29:47.170 --> 29:48.230
You were wrong.

29:48.230 --> 29:50.110
- Suppose he kills
somebody else.

29:50.110 --> 29:52.010
- Counsel, I...

29:58.040 --> 29:59.050
Did you come in here
for me

29:59.050 --> 30:00.130
to make it easier for you?

30:02.190 --> 30:04.180
I will.

30:04.180 --> 30:07.020
Go and prepare your closing.

30:07.020 --> 30:09.220
And if I have
the slightest suspicion

30:09.220 --> 30:12.130
that you are not vigorously
defending your client,

30:12.130 --> 30:14.150
I will, I promise you,

30:14.150 --> 30:17.160
turn you over
to the board of bar overseers.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.200
I will report
that you passed on information

30:19.200 --> 30:21.070
prejudicing your client,

30:21.070 --> 30:23.190
that you tried
to bias me against him,

30:23.190 --> 30:26.080
and that you threw the case.

30:26.080 --> 30:29.040
And you won't even make it
to tomorrow's ceremony.

30:33.190 --> 30:35.160
Now say, "Thank you,"

30:35.160 --> 30:36.220
and go.

30:52.030 --> 30:53.120
- Manslaughter, best we can do.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.170
- She didn't do it, Helen.

30:54.170 --> 30:56.130
- Coroner's telling me she did.

30:56.130 --> 30:57.160
- It was the father.

30:57.160 --> 30:59.080
- Oh, come on, Bobby.

30:59.080 --> 31:00.220
Don't you think
we'd like it to be the father?

31:00.220 --> 31:02.010
History of abuse.

31:02.010 --> 31:03.170
Tendency towards violence.

31:03.170 --> 31:05.130
He was the obvious suspect,

31:05.130 --> 31:08.190
but the doctors tell us
the death was immediate.

31:08.190 --> 31:12.090
Evelyn Mayfield
was the only one there.

31:12.090 --> 31:15.130
Is it true her church
is paying her legal fees?

31:15.130 --> 31:17.200
- Yeah.

31:17.200 --> 31:20.020
Helen, friend to friend?

31:20.020 --> 31:21.150
- Oh, yes, let's trade
on that trust thing

31:21.150 --> 31:23.060
I've got going with your office.

31:23.060 --> 31:24.080
- I think she's innocent.

31:24.080 --> 31:25.210
- Bobby, you always do.

31:25.210 --> 31:27.110
- And you always
think they're guilty.

31:27.110 --> 31:29.220
- Well, that's probably
why we didn't work out.

31:36.070 --> 31:38.020
I'll give you manslaughter.

31:41.140 --> 31:43.160
- Ms. Washington?

31:48.070 --> 31:49.230
Ms. Washington?

32:02.110 --> 32:06.020
- This may seem like just
a simple burglary case,

32:06.020 --> 32:08.190
but there's much more at stake.

32:08.190 --> 32:10.080
I promise you that.

32:14.130 --> 32:19.060
It's the integrity
of our criminal justice system.

32:19.060 --> 32:23.160
That system is designed
to preserve people's rights.

32:23.160 --> 32:27.000
We go to great lengths
to do that.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.080
One right is that someone
can't be found guilty

32:30.080 --> 32:31.100
without proof

32:31.100 --> 32:34.200
beyond a reasonable doubt.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.170
What do we have here?

32:36.170 --> 32:38.150
A nighttime I.D.,

32:38.150 --> 32:41.100
boxes covering
the burglar's face,

32:41.100 --> 32:45.050
the security guard
catching a momentary glimpse.

32:45.050 --> 32:48.100
That is their entire case.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.130
Not a big part, not most,

32:51.130 --> 32:55.140
but their entire case.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.220
A few seconds
as the suspect

32:57.220 --> 33:00.060
was running away
in the opposite direction

33:00.060 --> 33:02.190
with boxes blocking his face?

33:02.190 --> 33:06.160
Beyond a reasonable doubt?

33:06.160 --> 33:10.090
Add to that,
my client has an alibi.

33:10.090 --> 33:13.070
Mr. Ronzoni placed him at a bar

33:13.070 --> 33:16.110
at the exact time of the crime.

33:16.110 --> 33:19.130
Yes, they're friends.

33:19.130 --> 33:22.190
But he had a credit card
receipt, didn't he?

33:22.190 --> 33:24.190
The D.A.
is going to try

33:24.190 --> 33:27.050
to get you to believe
the security guard

33:27.050 --> 33:30.150
more than my client's
alibi witness;

33:30.150 --> 33:33.020
even if you do,

33:33.020 --> 33:36.000
that is not enough to convict.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.200
Remember,

33:37.200 --> 33:40.200
your verdict here isn't one of
those news magazine polls

33:40.200 --> 33:44.160
where you dial a 900 number
and give your opinion.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.010
You are not here
to render your opinion

33:47.010 --> 33:48.230
or your hunch.

33:48.230 --> 33:51.160
You're here to uphold an oath,

33:51.160 --> 33:55.220
an oath that's the very essence
of our jury system.

33:55.220 --> 33:58.040
We don't take away
a man's freedom

33:58.040 --> 34:04.020
unless the state
satisfies a burden of proof.

34:04.020 --> 34:06.170
They didn't.

34:06.170 --> 34:08.159
They didn't even come close.

34:16.210 --> 34:18.080
- I don't know about you,
but I always

34:18.080 --> 34:19.179
find it a little suspicious

34:19.179 --> 34:23.090
when defense lawyers
start waxing about oaths

34:23.090 --> 34:24.159
and integrity

34:24.159 --> 34:28.030
of systems and burdens of proof.

34:28.030 --> 34:31.090
It usually means
they're short on facts.

34:31.090 --> 34:34.179
Our system
isn't to turn criminals loose.

34:34.179 --> 34:37.199
Integrity isn't relying
on the credit card receipt

34:37.199 --> 34:39.100
of a suspect's buddy

34:39.100 --> 34:43.000
who makes
an 11th hour appearance.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.150
Your oath here
was to serve justice.

34:47.150 --> 34:48.179
We have an eyewitness,

34:48.179 --> 34:51.120
an eyewitness
who saw that man

34:51.120 --> 34:53.170
with the laser disc players.

34:53.170 --> 34:55.190
Come on.

34:55.190 --> 34:57.110
I agree that there is more
at stake here

34:57.110 --> 35:00.100
than a simple burglary.

35:00.100 --> 35:01.200
I also agree
that there's some integrity

35:01.200 --> 35:04.180
on the line.

35:04.180 --> 35:05.200
Yours.

35:10.180 --> 35:11.210
[door slams]

35:13.220 --> 35:15.070
- Sorry.

35:15.070 --> 35:16.070
- How'd she do?

35:16.070 --> 35:18.060
- I think pretty well.

35:18.060 --> 35:20.050
Okay, I've consulted
three lawyers,

35:20.050 --> 35:21.130
all guys I trust.

35:21.130 --> 35:24.070
All three say settle.

35:24.070 --> 35:26.040
- What?

35:26.040 --> 35:28.200
- People in this case,
let's call them jurors,

35:28.200 --> 35:31.060
aren't crazy about lawyers
to begin with.

35:31.060 --> 35:32.230
It's not likely
they'll be too sympathetic

35:32.230 --> 35:34.130
to qualified immunity arguments.

35:34.130 --> 35:35.220
Add to that the facts,

35:35.220 --> 35:37.070
pinning the victim's
one brother,

35:37.070 --> 35:40.150
add to that Tommy Silva,
Joe Red Sox fan,

35:40.150 --> 35:42.040
who juries love?

35:42.040 --> 35:44.200
The consensus is for us
to cut our losses

35:44.200 --> 35:46.070
and to get out.

35:46.070 --> 35:48.110
- What we did in that courtroom
is protected.

35:48.110 --> 35:50.050
- and I'm not running
from Tommy Silva.

35:50.050 --> 35:51.210
We've beaten bigger guys
than him.

35:51.210 --> 35:53.190
We've never been people
who run scared,

35:53.190 --> 35:56.060
I won't bend over for this,
I want to fight.

35:56.060 --> 35:59.210
- So do I.
- I say settle.

35:59.210 --> 36:02.130
- Jimmy?
- I say fight.

36:02.130 --> 36:05.010
Of course, I'm not a partner.

36:05.010 --> 36:07.070
I'm not at risk
like everybody else.

36:07.070 --> 36:10.040
Including Rebecca,
who's not even sworn in yet.

36:10.040 --> 36:13.010
I'm just an associate.

36:13.010 --> 36:15.090
- I keep going back
to what if we lose.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.110
It's not just a case.
- I don't--

36:17.110 --> 36:19.210
- And it's not just a conference
table.

36:19.210 --> 36:22.030
This could be
our whole practice.

36:22.030 --> 36:23.150
- Then we start over.

36:23.150 --> 36:25.080
- Whatever we do,

36:25.080 --> 36:26.170
it can't be a decision
out of ego.

36:26.170 --> 36:28.010
- I want to fight.

36:28.010 --> 36:29.030
- We have to fight it.

36:32.010 --> 36:32.435
- Okay.

36:36.050 --> 36:37.110
Jimmy, you'll first chair.

36:37.110 --> 36:39.030
both: What?
- What?

36:39.030 --> 36:41.100
- Silva's style is
"I'm just a regular guy,"

36:41.100 --> 36:43.180
Jimmy's our best guy
to counter that.

36:43.180 --> 36:44.190
He's regular too.

36:44.190 --> 36:46.150
- Yeah, well, if that's--

36:46.150 --> 36:48.030
You know, look,
no offense, Jimmy,

36:48.030 --> 36:50.060
but we need our best
at our best.

36:50.060 --> 36:51.210
Shouldn't you be doing it?

36:51.210 --> 36:54.070
I mean, he's good.
I mean, you're great.

36:54.070 --> 36:56.060
But we need our--
- Best.

36:56.060 --> 36:58.090
- Jimmy will first chair.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.130
I'll second.

37:00.130 --> 37:03.230
Anything else?

37:03.230 --> 37:05.160
- Okay, back to work.

37:05.160 --> 37:07.180
- Bobby, Evelyn Mayfield's
here with her husband.

37:10.050 --> 37:11.030
Who died?

37:14.110 --> 37:18.000
- How long we got to wait?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.150
- Well, they'll only
go for another hour;

37:19.150 --> 37:21.090
then suspend till tomorrow.

37:23.060 --> 37:25.130
You guys got plans or something?

37:31.210 --> 37:34.020
- They've offered manslaughter.

37:34.020 --> 37:36.000
It's something
that we should consider.

37:38.200 --> 37:42.020
- Surely you're not
suggesting she plead guilty.

37:42.020 --> 37:44.140
- What I'm suggesting
is they have a medical case

37:44.140 --> 37:48.100
indicating that the child
died almost immediately.

37:48.100 --> 37:51.070
That will be tough
for us to explain.

37:51.070 --> 37:53.050
And there's a risk
of a murder two conviction.

37:53.050 --> 37:56.170
That's 20 years, maybe more.

37:56.170 --> 38:00.010
Manslaughter, good behavior,
you could be out in three.

38:00.010 --> 38:02.120
- But I didn't do this.

38:02.120 --> 38:04.080
- I know
this doesn't sound great,

38:04.080 --> 38:07.010
but whether you did it or not
doesn't really matter.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.020
- Doesn't matter?

38:10.020 --> 38:12.150
- Of course
it matters on one level.

38:12.150 --> 38:14.080
In terms
of deciding how to proceed here,

38:14.080 --> 38:17.000
what I have to weigh
is the prosecution's chances

38:17.000 --> 38:18.160
of convicting you.

38:18.160 --> 38:23.110
Your innocence is almost--
almost irrelevant there.

38:23.110 --> 38:26.090
As I said,
they have a circumstantial case,

38:26.090 --> 38:32.020
but, in my opinion,

38:32.020 --> 38:36.090
emotion will be against you.

38:36.090 --> 38:38.230
I'm not crazy
about rolling the dice.

38:38.230 --> 38:41.080
Not with 20 years.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.230
- I didn't shake that baby.

38:48.230 --> 38:50.080
And I'm sitting with one of

38:50.080 --> 38:51.210
the best criminal lawyers
in the city,

38:51.210 --> 38:53.160
and he's telling me
to plead guilty.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.180
- I'm telling you,

38:54.180 --> 38:57.020
you could be looking at guilty.

38:59.090 --> 39:03.130
- That baby came to me crying.

39:03.130 --> 39:05.010
After about ten minutes,

39:05.010 --> 39:08.200
I was finally able
to console him.

39:08.200 --> 39:13.030
I rocked him
until he fell asleep.

39:13.030 --> 39:16.130
I put him in his crib.

39:16.130 --> 39:20.090
I came back in about 15 minutes,

39:20.090 --> 39:22.080
and he was dead.

39:25.090 --> 39:26.220
If I'm convicted of killing him,

39:26.220 --> 39:28.210
then so be it.

39:28.210 --> 39:31.090
But I didn't kill him.

39:31.090 --> 39:32.190
I know it

39:32.190 --> 39:34.130
and God knows it.

39:34.130 --> 39:37.230
And I suspect that
that child's father knows it.

39:37.230 --> 39:40.190
And I will not say
that I did do it

39:40.190 --> 39:43.090
just to get less jail time.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.220
- Okay.

39:55.140 --> 39:57.130
Then we go to trial.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.180
- Will the defendant
please rise?

40:09.220 --> 40:12.050
- Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

40:12.050 --> 40:13.140
- We have, Your Honor.

40:13.140 --> 40:16.090
- What say you?

40:16.090 --> 40:18.070
- In the matter
of Commonwealth versus

40:18.070 --> 40:19.210
Russell Thurm

40:19.210 --> 40:22.090
on the charge of breaking
and entering at night,

40:22.090 --> 40:26.010
we find the defendant,
Russell Thurm, not guilty.

40:30.060 --> 40:32.130
- The jury is dismissed
with the thanks of the court.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.170
We're adjourned.

40:33.170 --> 40:34.160
[gavel bangs]

40:52.210 --> 40:54.210
- Thanks.

40:54.210 --> 40:56.040
- Yeah.

41:05.020 --> 41:06.180
- Not guilty!
- Really?

41:06.180 --> 41:08.030
- She's on her way
to the ceremony now,

41:08.030 --> 41:09.120
which, by the way,
we better get a move on.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.090
Jimmy! Bobby!
Let's go!

41:11.090 --> 41:13.050
- Coming!
- We've got time.

41:13.050 --> 41:14.150
It's Washington, W.

41:14.150 --> 41:16.000
They'll be calling her
at the end.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.070
- And we should be there
at the beginning.

41:17.070 --> 41:19.030
- Let's go.

41:19.030 --> 41:20.120
- Hey Jimmy, you got a sec?

41:23.220 --> 41:26.070
I didn't mean to put you down.

41:26.070 --> 41:27.170
It's just with this case,

41:27.170 --> 41:31.070
so much on the line...

41:31.070 --> 41:32.200
Please don't misunderstand me.

41:34.190 --> 41:36.120
- I understand you perfect.

41:48.040 --> 41:51.130
- Can you believe
she's about to be sworn in?

41:51.130 --> 41:53.040
- Hey, you think I should go
to law school?

41:53.040 --> 41:56.100
- No.

41:56.100 --> 41:59.070
- China Rain, I like that.
Helen wears that.

41:59.070 --> 42:03.010
- I'm not wearing China Rain.

42:03.010 --> 42:05.000
- I wear Slovakian Snow.

42:08.100 --> 42:10.020
- We hugged hello.

42:13.140 --> 42:14.120
- Please rise.

42:17.130 --> 42:20.230
Raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

42:20.230 --> 42:22.170
I, your name,

42:22.170 --> 42:25.160
solemnly swear
that I will do no falsehood.
