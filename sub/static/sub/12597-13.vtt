Hey, you notice anything
different about me?

00:36.504 --> 00:41.206
Being away has given me
a chance to do something
I've always wanted to do.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.742
Grow a beard.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.211

Mr. Prusko is having
a competition to see
who can build

02:12.433 --> 02:14.967
the best eco-friendly robot.

02:14.969 --> 02:18.137
Full disclosure: I already built
a composting robot

02:18.139 --> 02:21.106
in the hope that someone would
one day create a competition.

02:21.108 --> 02:23.308
Full disclosure:
I'm not impressed.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.146
I can build one of those
in a day.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.515
Perhaps,
if you lived on Venus

02:29.517 --> 02:32.484
where an average day is
243 Earth days.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.354
Ha! Ha! Ha!

02:35.356 --> 02:36.655
Overheated.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.960
Uh, Alex,
I think you mean "burn."

02:41.962 --> 02:43.295
Thank you
for the correction.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.197
Burn.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.335
Well, get ready
for a "ro-beatdown."

02:50.337 --> 02:52.004
Oh, it is on,

02:52.006 --> 02:54.373
which I'm told is popular
street vernacular

02:54.375 --> 02:56.875
used to indicate the beginning
of a heated competition.

02:56.877 --> 02:57.943
Yo!

03:01.982 --> 03:04.316
You're challenging Alex?

03:04.318 --> 03:06.518
Dude, I'm not even going to go
up against her.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.620
She's the best roboticist
in the school.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.856
-You just got here, Parker.
-I know.

03:10.858 --> 03:14.026
It's time to take down
the biggest, baddest
robot-maker at Ridgewood

03:14.028 --> 03:17.496
-to make a name for myself.
-All right, all right.

03:17.498 --> 03:21.300
But you better make sure
that robot can give you
a big hug when you lose.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.502
I'm just kidding.
I can still do that.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.371
Get in these arms!
Get in 'em!

03:33.514 --> 03:35.581
Oh!

03:35.583 --> 03:37.482
Bam! What?

03:37.484 --> 03:42.521
That is H-O-R-S-E,

03:42.523 --> 03:44.022
college boy!

03:44.024 --> 03:45.991
I win.

03:45.993 --> 03:49.661
I want to redeem myself...

03:49.663 --> 03:52.364
on a higher court.

03:52.366 --> 03:56.101
Do you mean...
Tree-House Horse?

03:57.171 --> 03:59.838
Dad and I are so competitive,

03:59.840 --> 04:02.407
we came up with
a completely new game:

04:02.409 --> 04:05.410
Tree-House Horse.

04:05.412 --> 04:09.281
Later, we realized that
we did not have a tree house,
so we built one.

04:16.457 --> 04:20.559
It's nice to have
an engineering genius
in the family.

04:20.561 --> 04:24.796
I calculated the structural
engineering schematics
to make the tree house safe.

04:24.798 --> 04:28.567
Then they banned me from it
just because I added an antenna

04:28.569 --> 04:30.469
that would redirect
a couple of satellites.

04:30.471 --> 04:34.373
All of a sudden,
I'm "unpredictable"
and "vaguely maniacal."

04:35.876 --> 04:37.976
I guess nobody wants free cable.

04:40.080 --> 04:44.549
Okay. Granny-style.
Nothing but net.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.187
Whoo!

04:50.257 --> 04:51.456
Nice shot.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.493
But now it's
Prime Time's turn.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.769
(scoffs) Oh!

05:03.771 --> 05:07.539
You lose, Past Your Prime Time.

05:10.244 --> 05:12.110
I miss that smack talk.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.513
-(laughs)
-It's good to be home, Mad Dog.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.248
I missed you.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.419
Dad, actually, can we talk
about something?

05:20.421 --> 05:23.555
Talk about?
Or compliment?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.693
I just need some advice,

05:27.695 --> 05:29.661
and I would definitely go
to Mom, but...

05:29.663 --> 05:31.763
she'd want to talk,
about my feelings,

05:31.765 --> 05:33.665
and I just need
a game plan, Coach.

05:33.667 --> 05:37.002
-Should I go get my whistle?
-No, no. It's not...

05:38.505 --> 05:40.505
Um...

05:40.507 --> 05:44.109
Just... how am I gonna know

05:44.111 --> 05:47.746
when it's time
to start dating again?

05:49.650 --> 05:51.783
Wow.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.553
This would be
a whole lot easier
with my whistle.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.325
Um...

06:00.327 --> 06:03.662
So, there's this guy,

06:03.664 --> 06:06.698
and he likes me,

06:06.700 --> 06:10.602
and I think...
maybe I like him.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.574
I just don't want
to get hurt again.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.009
You know?

06:18.011 --> 06:21.213
Listen. Do you remember
when you hurt your knee?

06:22.683 --> 06:25.083
And you were scared
that it would never heal,

06:25.085 --> 06:28.053
but you took some time off,
you did your exercises,

06:28.055 --> 06:32.224
and now, look at you--
you're better than ever.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.661
Yeah, but that's a knee,
you know.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.730
Hearts don't really heal
like that.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.666
Of course they do.

06:41.668 --> 06:46.438
At some point,
you are going to be ready
to date again, I promise.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.609
When it's the right guy,

06:50.611 --> 06:52.477
you're just going to know.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.016
Cool.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.786
Thanks, Dad.

07:01.889 --> 07:07.492
Are you ready
for another devastating loss?

07:09.129 --> 07:11.596
Got to be better
than talking about boys.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.705
No way!

07:20.707 --> 07:24.276
The number one talk show
in France wants to interview me

07:24.278 --> 07:26.812
about <i> Voltage </i> via satellite.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.781
Liv! Well, honey,
That's <i> incroyable!</i>

07:29.783 --> 07:31.483
Oh, bless you.

07:33.086 --> 07:36.655
<i>Incroyable,</i>
it's French for "incredible."

07:36.657 --> 07:40.158
I spent four months in France
in college. Remember?

07:40.160 --> 07:43.428
Sweetie, how are you going to do
a French interview

07:43.430 --> 07:44.830
if you don't understand French?

07:44.832 --> 07:47.666
Uh, well, it looks like
they already sent me
the question,

07:47.668 --> 07:50.101
so I'll probably
just answer in English,
then they're gonna translate.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.636
Now, sweetie,
sweetie, sweetie.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.172
If you want to win over
the country of
(gutturally) France...

07:54.174 --> 07:57.843
you are going to want to answer
those questions in French.

07:57.845 --> 08:01.112
The will eat it up
with <i> le spoon.</i>

08:01.114 --> 08:04.449
Oh. I mean, um, I only have
like a day to prepare,

08:04.451 --> 08:06.017
and I don't think I can learn
French that quickly,

08:06.019 --> 08:07.352
at least without a tutor.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.855
Well, then,
look no further. Okay?

08:09.857 --> 08:11.923
I could whip you into shape
in seconds flat.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.893
I've been speaking French to you
since you were born. Remember?

08:16.029 --> 08:19.831
(singing <i> Alouette)</i>

08:23.804 --> 08:26.805
By the time you were two,
you were speaking English
and French.

08:26.807 --> 08:30.342
<i>Français </i> is locked
in your childhood memories.

08:30.344 --> 08:33.645
We just need to--
to coax it out.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.715
Okay, well, coax all you want,
but there's no French up there.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.784
Liv, honey, your first word
was in French. Remember?

08:39.786 --> 08:40.886
<i>Papillon.</i>

08:40.888 --> 08:42.854
Uh... (mutters in French)

08:42.856 --> 08:44.789
Oh, yeah.
(French accent) "Butterfly."

08:46.793 --> 08:49.327
Oh, well. How can I argue
when you look

08:49.329 --> 08:51.696
that adorable?

08:51.698 --> 08:54.399
This is going to be

09:45.452 --> 09:47.185
(whooshes)

09:47.187 --> 09:50.722
I stayed up all night
and had to improvise
with a few parts,

09:50.724 --> 09:52.757
but I'm going
to destroy Alex.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.226
-(bleeping)
-What?

09:55.228 --> 09:58.930
No way!
It shakes and emits gas,
just like I do!

10:00.267 --> 10:02.267
No, that wasn't supposed
to happen.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.974
All of my improvised parts
overloaded the motherboard.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.909
It's totally fried.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.311
But you can still rebuild
him, right?

10:13.313 --> 10:16.781
I mean, he's--
he's still gorgeous.

10:16.783 --> 10:20.051
The competition is in an hour.
There's no time.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.489
Maybe I'm just not as good
as I think I am.

10:24.491 --> 10:29.327
Like, I guess I should go
to the competition and...
concede defeat.

10:29.329 --> 10:32.063
Are you serious?
You're going to quit?

10:32.065 --> 10:33.732
You?

10:33.734 --> 10:36.167
I really don't have
any other choice.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.804
It's not over until we say
that it's over, Parker.

10:39.806 --> 10:43.742
And... I have an idea.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.544
Oh, then it's definitely over.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.982
You want to hear my idea,
don't you, handsome?

10:50.984 --> 10:53.818
Yeah, you do.
Get in these arms!

10:59.493 --> 11:01.459
Hey, Mr. Rooney.

11:01.461 --> 11:04.729
Wow! New beard?
Looks tight.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.033
Finally!

11:08.035 --> 11:09.534
My man!

11:09.536 --> 11:11.169
I knew I liked you, Josh.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.004
Uh, so what's all this?

11:13.006 --> 11:17.175
Oh, yeah. Maddie and I
just played a game of
Tree-House Horse.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.944
From-- from way up there?

11:19.946 --> 11:22.947
Wow. No... thank you.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.783
I'm crazy-scared of heights.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.886
Yeah, well, it's Maddie's
favorite thing to do, so...

11:27.888 --> 11:29.854
Really? Huh.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.391
-Well, Liv's waiting for me.
-Yeah.

11:35.662 --> 11:38.797
Hey, Mr. Rooney, could I ask
your advice about something?

11:39.966 --> 11:42.300
He wants my advice.

11:42.302 --> 11:45.070
Maddie wanted my advice.

11:45.072 --> 11:49.774
It's the beard.
It makes me look so wise.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.011
It's totally the beard.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.113
He's like a wizard.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.883
Whose beard? What...?

11:58.885 --> 12:00.819
I'm sorry. What are
we talking about right now?

12:01.988 --> 12:04.889
Okay, so, I really like
this girl,

12:04.891 --> 12:08.727
and she might like me back,
but I'm not sure.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.229
What do I do?

12:12.532 --> 12:14.999
Allow me to consult the beard.

12:17.037 --> 12:20.405
Find out what she likes
to do and then do it.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.273
She'll appreciate
the gesture.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.942
Yeah.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.177
Yeah, thanks, Mr. Rooney.
Great advice.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.113
And great beard.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.016
You're my boy, Josh!

12:38.725 --> 12:41.392
-Whoa.
-(laughs)

12:41.394 --> 12:43.027
Liv, honey,
I'm glad you're here.

12:43.029 --> 12:46.931
I have labeled
every last thing in this room
with its French translation,

12:46.933 --> 12:49.934
so that you can ace
your French interview.

12:51.071 --> 12:55.240
Okay. Um, Mom, I don't need
to be fluent in French.

12:55.242 --> 12:58.443
I just need to answer
five questions about <i> Voltage.</i>

12:58.445 --> 13:01.079
Honey, the French is in there.

13:01.081 --> 13:04.048
We just need to unlock it,
and until we do,

13:04.050 --> 13:06.117
you are going to eat,
breathe and swim in French.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.986
How do you swim in French?

13:07.988 --> 13:11.122
Well, it'll be <i> difficile,</i>
but we'll find a way.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.327
Okay. Um...
let's give it a shot.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.496
I'm just gonna go get
a snack and then I'm all in.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.998
Oh, oh.
(clears throat)

13:20.000 --> 13:22.233
<i>Barre de granola?</i>

13:22.235 --> 13:24.235
-Sure, I'd love a granola bar.
-No, no, no, no.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.171
(speaks French)

13:26.173 --> 13:28.173
<i>Barre de granola?</i>

13:31.144 --> 13:33.178
<i>Barre de granola?</i>

13:35.949 --> 13:39.083
<i>-Barre de gran--</i>
-I'm not hungry anymore.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.625
Mr. Prusko.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.128
May I present my creation.

13:50.130 --> 13:54.132
Ah. Cold, calculating,
emotionless.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.434
And you also made a robot.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.972
Oh, Parker. Let's take
a look at your robot.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.007
Actually, that's
what I'm here to tell you.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.543
I didn't come
with a robot.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.012
I know. It was delivered
a little while ago.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.382
-It was?
-Yeah.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.556
(beeping)

14:25.131 --> 14:27.198
Could-- could you give me
one moment to make

14:27.200 --> 14:29.100
some adjustments to my robot?

14:33.673 --> 14:36.007
-Ow!
-What are you doing?

14:36.009 --> 14:37.909
Saving your bacon.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.644
You can thank me later.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.746
With bacon.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.288
(chuckles)

14:51.324 --> 14:54.158
More Tree-House Horse, Dad?

15:03.336 --> 15:06.271
-Josh?
-Hey, Maddie.

15:07.774 --> 15:10.842
What's-- Why? What--
Why are you-- What?

15:10.844 --> 15:12.710
Why are you up here?

15:12.712 --> 15:17.081
To play some Tree-House Horse,
because that's what you love,

15:17.083 --> 15:18.917
even though
I'm scared of heights,

15:18.919 --> 15:22.820
which I thought
I could overcome,
but we are way up here.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.627
Dude, seriously?

15:29.629 --> 15:32.964
I mean, if you're afraid
of heights, let's just get down.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.800
No, no way. No way.
This is something
that you like to do,

15:35.802 --> 15:38.336
so... here I am.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.141
Josh, why are
you doing this?

15:43.143 --> 15:45.176
Because...

15:47.113 --> 15:49.514
I really like you, Maddie...

15:51.117 --> 15:53.785
and I want to go
out with you.

15:56.156 --> 16:00.258
Josh, I don't know if I'm ready
to go out with anybody yet.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.893
Okay.

16:01.895 --> 16:05.163
Well, that also means
you don't know

16:05.165 --> 16:07.832
if you're not ready.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.671
I guess that's technically true.

16:13.673 --> 16:17.308
How about we play a game
of Tree-House Horse?

16:17.310 --> 16:21.679
If I win, you agree
to go out with me
on a date.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.651
Okay. Deal.

16:28.955 --> 16:32.490
Ooh! This is gonna be sad.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.500
I know you're afraid to look,

16:42.502 --> 16:45.169
but, uh, it did go in.

16:48.875 --> 16:52.343
(<i> La Marseillaise </i> playing)

16:54.714 --> 16:56.381
(in French accent)
Welcome, Liv,

16:56.383 --> 16:58.383
to <i> Cafe du Mama</i>

16:58.385 --> 17:01.185
for Madame Rooney's famous

17:01.187 --> 17:03.755
immersion excursion.

17:05.225 --> 17:08.026
Okay, Mom.
This is really very sweet,

17:08.028 --> 17:10.695
but this whole trying-to-jog-
my-memory-into-speaking-
more-French thing

17:10.697 --> 17:12.230
just isn't going to work.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.032
I mean, there's
no French up here.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.867
Okay, okay. Just let me try
one more thing,

17:15.869 --> 17:18.302
and if it doesn't work,
I swear, we'll stop.

17:18.304 --> 17:19.704
Okay, but fine.
This is like it, okay?

17:19.706 --> 17:21.873
-Okay. What are we doing?
-Okay.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.241
Oh! Oh, we're doing this.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.243
Okay, okay. Shh!

17:25.245 --> 17:27.845
Sense memory,
<i>mon papillon.</i>

17:27.847 --> 17:29.447
<i>Monsieur?</i>

17:31.351 --> 17:34.318
(singing <i> Alouette)</i>

17:40.226 --> 17:44.429
(continuing lullaby)

17:46.399 --> 17:48.366
(sings in deep voice)

17:48.368 --> 17:50.234
(sings in French)

17:50.236 --> 17:53.237
(gasping)

17:53.239 --> 17:56.941
(both singing)

18:00.346 --> 18:03.448
(speaking French)

18:10.423 --> 18:13.024
We did it!
We unlocked your French!

18:13.026 --> 18:15.126
Oh! I am gonna crush
this interview!

18:19.232 --> 18:22.066
Do you seriously expect us
to believe that this is a robot?

18:22.068 --> 18:24.135
It is clearly Joey,
painted silver,

18:24.137 --> 18:25.470
with some tinfoil
glued to his face.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.907
Wow, Mr. Prusko.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.543
I built a robot so lifelike,
it passes as human,

18:32.545 --> 18:34.378
and she can't take it.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.481
You know what?
I'm offended.

18:36.483 --> 18:39.350
Me and my superior robot
are going home.

18:45.492 --> 18:48.359
You know what?
Maybe you should go home.

18:49.662 --> 18:53.097
I challenge you to a contest
to see who composts better.

18:53.099 --> 18:56.467
My robot versus your
Joey disguised as a robot.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.505
Parker, do you accept
the challenge?

19:02.742 --> 19:05.476
Challenge accepted!

19:06.412 --> 19:08.679
What...? Wait.
What would it involve?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.416
Feeding them buckets
of rotten garbage.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.489
If that is truly a robot,
it should have no trouble

19:18.491 --> 19:22.360
processing these slimy,
rancid hot dog chunks

19:22.362 --> 19:24.395
and fuzzy noodles.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.369
Okay, Munchbot...

19:33.106 --> 19:35.339
let's get to munching.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.894
-I can't do this!
-Oh yes!

19:56.896 --> 19:58.896
I mean, uh... (stammering)

19:58.898 --> 20:01.899
(as Munchbot)
Does not compute.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.336
This isn't really a robot.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.238
It's Joey.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.307
I am victorious.

20:09.309 --> 20:12.577
I shall now go bust a move.

20:12.579 --> 20:15.146
I have 17 minutes
before my stand-up comedy class.

20:21.020 --> 20:24.188
Hey. Why'd you do
all this?

20:24.190 --> 20:27.558
Because, man,
you were going to quit,

20:27.560 --> 20:29.560
and that's not like you.

20:29.562 --> 20:33.531
I just really wanted to show
everybody that I was the best,

20:33.533 --> 20:36.567
and... I couldn't.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.403
Look, I know how tough
it's been for me

20:39.405 --> 20:41.105
to try and figure out
high school.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.941
I can't imagine trying to go
through it at your age.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.611
But you don't have to conquer
this place

20:46.613 --> 20:48.613
in your first semester.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.482
Just keep working
and don't quit.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.518
Thanks, Munch.

20:55.722 --> 20:58.122
Now get in these arms!

21:03.196 --> 21:05.696
Okay, LeBlond James.

21:07.200 --> 21:12.603
You currently have H-O-R-S,
so you miss this one...

21:12.605 --> 21:14.605
Which seems likely.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.141
...then I win.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.122
I will pay for that.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.326
Guess you're off the hook
for that date.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.529
I'll see you around.

21:42.235 --> 21:43.634
Wow.

21:45.438 --> 21:49.140
Since when did being
vulnerable get so cute?

21:50.743 --> 21:52.510
(stammers)
Hold on!

21:52.512 --> 21:54.745
I literally could not be
holding on any tighter.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.818
So if you won,
I was supposed to...

22:00.820 --> 22:03.587
you know, go out
on a date with you.

22:03.589 --> 22:08.326
But we actually never
really covered

22:08.328 --> 22:10.728
what happens if I win.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.032
Okay.
Name your prize.

22:17.036 --> 22:19.603
I think I want you to...

22:20.707 --> 22:23.274
go out with me.

22:23.276 --> 22:25.543
Wait. What? Really?

22:26.879 --> 22:29.046
Dad said that I would know
when I was ready.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.551
I think I'm ready.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.488
Yeah.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.623
Josh, will you go out with me?

22:39.625 --> 22:41.525
Yes!

22:41.527 --> 22:43.060
Whoo-hoo!

22:47.500 --> 22:49.400
Did you see...?

22:49.402 --> 22:52.403
I was up there so high.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.845
We heard some yelling.
You guys okay?

23:00.847 --> 23:03.013
Oh, Maddie beat me
at Tree-House Horse.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.616
Yeah. That happens.

23:06.652 --> 23:09.320
Uh, thanks for the girl advice,
Mr. Rooney.

23:09.322 --> 23:11.322
Maddie and I are
going on a date.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.426
Maddie's the girl?

23:16.896 --> 23:19.130
My beard betrayed me.

23:20.266 --> 23:23.267
I was right.
That beard is wise.

23:23.269 --> 23:26.270
-Oh!
-It's a beard!

23:26.272 --> 23:29.340
That's what's different!

23:29.342 --> 23:31.509
You look nice!

23:31.511 --> 23:32.910
Karen: Barre de granola?
