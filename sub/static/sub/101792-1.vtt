WEBVTT

01:16.568 --> 01:18.703
Are you being purposely stupid
The MAC is bullshit.

01:18.771 --> 01:20.907
It has no software,
it has no memory,

01:20.973 --> 01:21.974
it has no expansion.

01:22.041 --> 01:24.043
No, I'm talking
about the MAC Plus.

01:24.110 --> 01:26.145
It has a full megabyte of ram,

01:26.212 --> 01:28.513
expandable to four
and a scuzzy interface.

01:28.580 --> 01:29.714
Who cares,
what does that even mean?

01:29.782 --> 01:31.650
It means peripherals, scanners,

01:31.716 --> 01:34.653
modems, hard drives.
I will actually be computing

01:34.719 --> 01:36.989
while you're playing Kings Quest
on your PCjr.

01:37.056 --> 01:38.758
My PCjr with 16 color graphics

01:38.825 --> 01:40.159
and built-in joystick boards?

01:40.226 --> 01:42.694
You mean my PCjr with
a three-voice tone generator?

01:42.762 --> 01:44.864
Hey! What the fuck
are you looking at?

01:44.931 --> 01:46.933
Shit, it's Frankie.
We're never getting in tonight.

01:46.999 --> 01:48.533
He's better than Rizzo,
that's what I think.

01:48.600 --> 01:49.802
What grade are you in?

01:50.837 --> 01:52.138
Eighth.

01:52.205 --> 01:53.940
The back.

01:54.006 --> 01:55.741
Eighth grade in the back.

01:55.808 --> 01:57.642
Hey, get to the fucking back.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.815
No one's getting in yet.

02:06.685 --> 02:08.687
W-w-wait, you're talking about
my PCjr

02:08.754 --> 02:11.556
with a wireless keyboard.
You mean, that PCjr?

02:11.623 --> 02:14.559
Yeah, a wireless keyboard
and a 14-inch monitor.

02:14.626 --> 02:16.628
I hope it comes with a sweet
pair of binoculars.

02:16.695 --> 02:18.831
- What're you guys talking about?
- Don't worry about it.

02:18.898 --> 02:20.032
I'm not worried.

02:20.099 --> 02:21.868
Stuff the kids are onto
in like eight years.

02:21.934 --> 02:22.969
Who else is here?

02:23.035 --> 02:24.136
I don't know.
Just us from our grade.

02:24.203 --> 02:27.039
- We better get in.
- We're gonna get in.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.107
Not until the older kids get in,

02:28.174 --> 02:29.641
but after that,
we're gonna get in.

02:29.708 --> 02:33.612
But not definitely, it's gonna
be harder because of the kids.

02:33.678 --> 02:34.780
Because of all the stuff
that happened.

02:34.847 --> 02:36.115
It's not gonna be harder.

02:36.182 --> 02:37.917
The stuff has nothing
to do with us getting in.

02:37.984 --> 02:38.985
We're gonna get in.

02:39.051 --> 02:40.987
Paybacks!

02:44.723 --> 02:45.858
So, Lanky's coming.

02:45.925 --> 02:46.993
What about Lanky?

02:47.059 --> 02:48.194
- He's coming tonight.
- Yeah, right.

02:48.261 --> 02:50.662
- Lanky can't...
- He's definitely not coming.

02:50.730 --> 02:52.098
I know for a fact he's coming.

02:52.164 --> 02:55.001
You can't do what Lanky did
and still go with things.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.736
Well, Brian Tate's brother
works in Clearbrook,

02:56.802 --> 02:57.904
and he said Lanky's coming.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.805
And I don't care
if you believe me or not.

03:01.207 --> 03:02.607
Why are you looking, Missy?

03:02.674 --> 03:04.810
I'm not looking Kira, god.

03:39.711 --> 03:42.614
- Looking for UFOs?
- What? No. No way, man.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.683
There weren't any UFOs.
Don't believe that shit.

03:44.750 --> 03:46.018
I don't believe it.

03:46.085 --> 03:48.220
She's definitely getting us,
right, like, after?

03:48.287 --> 03:49.422
Yeah, she's-she's getting us.

03:49.487 --> 03:51.157
What if we don't get in,
can she get us then?

03:51.223 --> 03:52.524
Look, we're getting in.

03:52.590 --> 03:53.859
- If only you get in...
- No, we're both getting in.

03:53.926 --> 03:54.961
Stop worrying about situations
that don't exist.

03:55.027 --> 03:58.596
- Why do you do that?
- I don't know.

03:58.663 --> 04:00.232
I-I don't know.

04:00.299 --> 04:02.201
- It's-It's in there, right?
- Yeah.

04:02.268 --> 04:04.536
- Don't tell anyone.
- I won't.

04:04.602 --> 04:06.172
- Don't show anyone.
- I know.

04:28.728 --> 04:30.329
- How'd you get here?
- Why?

04:30.396 --> 04:31.629
Just asking.
There's no why to it.

04:31.696 --> 04:34.666
My mom. She thinks Polo's
is different than it is.

04:34.734 --> 04:36.102
And it's not far
from the UFO thing.

04:36.168 --> 04:37.436
What, with the meeting?

04:37.502 --> 04:39.972
God, it's so stupid.
Everyone here is so stupid.

04:40.039 --> 04:42.975
My dad's at the meeting,
he says UFOs are real.

04:43.042 --> 04:44.609
They're not real.
They were planes.

04:44.676 --> 04:46.578
Derek Scropelli's father
filmed it.

04:46.644 --> 04:48.713
It's like a NASA thing now.

04:48.781 --> 04:50.116
It's bullshit. The entire thing.

04:50.182 --> 04:52.218
How could it be planes
if the government's involved?

04:52.284 --> 04:55.087
If the government's involved
then we're all fucked.

04:55.154 --> 04:56.721
Fucking Reagan.

04:57.990 --> 05:02.928
Yeah, uh,
Reagan's really really bad.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.734
- Wait, you came alone?
- I came with Jody Fagan.

05:08.801 --> 05:10.336
You don't even know
Jody Fagan.

05:10.403 --> 05:12.304
Shut up, Kira.
I know her now, okay.

05:12.371 --> 05:14.173
- Ninth grade Jody Fagan?
- Jody Amazing?

05:14.240 --> 05:15.607
How many Jody Fagans
are there?

05:15.673 --> 05:16.809
That's Jody Fagans?

05:16.876 --> 05:18.244
Everybody calls her
Jody Amazing.

05:18.310 --> 05:20.678
I'm just watching it.

05:20.746 --> 05:21.881
I am Jody Amazing

05:21.947 --> 05:23.548
from the planet hot.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.219
What?

05:27.286 --> 05:28.320
Wait, when did you start
hanging out with Jody Fagan?

05:28.387 --> 05:31.290
None of your business.
Over the summer.

05:31.357 --> 05:32.525
Where's Jody Fagan now?

05:32.590 --> 05:34.626
She's talking to some
Belmont kids in Lye.

05:34.692 --> 05:35.693
It's not like a big deal.

05:44.837 --> 05:46.138
It's really not fair.

05:46.205 --> 05:49.308
It's just one pop quiz.
It's not the end of the world.

05:49.375 --> 05:51.643
Hey, Dean, who's at the door?
Is it Frankie or Rizzo?

05:51.709 --> 05:52.845
It's Frankie tonight.

05:52.912 --> 05:54.313
- That's cool, right?
- It's better than Rizzo.

05:54.380 --> 05:56.982
That's exactly what I said,
Frankie's better than Rizzo.

05:57.049 --> 05:59.819
Three out of five should be
more. It should be worth more.

05:59.885 --> 06:01.353
Three out of five is 60 percent.

06:01.420 --> 06:02.488
Shel, why do you have
a backpack?

06:02.555 --> 06:04.323
It should be in 80 percent
at least.

06:04.390 --> 06:06.058
Four out of five's 80.

06:06.125 --> 06:07.893
Yeah, but four out of five
is almost perfect,

06:07.960 --> 06:09.795
and three out of five,
that's next to almost perfect

06:09.862 --> 06:11.163
and it's only 60 percent.

06:11.230 --> 06:12.597
It's an F.

06:12.664 --> 06:15.734
God! The school year just
started and I already have an F.

06:15.801 --> 06:17.303
Why do you have
a giant backpack?

06:17.369 --> 06:19.071
I'm staying over Brad's so...

06:19.138 --> 06:20.272
So are you, like, moving there
permanently?

06:20.339 --> 06:22.208
Are you running away
from home, Shel?

06:22.274 --> 06:23.776
Are you a teen runaway?

06:23.843 --> 06:25.778
It's one pop quiz it's nothing.

06:25.845 --> 06:27.913
Yeah, but it counts now.
It's eighth grade.

06:27.980 --> 06:29.681
It, like, counts.

06:29.748 --> 06:31.183
No, eighth grade does not count.

06:31.250 --> 06:32.885
Hey, do you guys know
that Lanky's coming?

06:32.952 --> 06:34.153
Why are you saying
Lanky's coming

06:34.220 --> 06:35.221
when two seconds ago,
you didn't believe it?

06:35.287 --> 06:38.190
- Just saying it.
- Lanky's in jail, idiot.

06:38.257 --> 06:39.492
It's not jail, Kira.

06:39.558 --> 06:42.461
Brad's right about eighth grade.
It doesn't count.

06:42.528 --> 06:43.729
How do you know?

06:43.796 --> 06:44.897
'Cause I have two brothers
in college and...

06:44.964 --> 06:46.832
and all that time,
nobody said anything

06:46.899 --> 06:48.033
about eighth grade counting.

06:49.235 --> 06:51.237
How did you get
five out of five?

06:51.303 --> 06:54.306
If you pay attention in class,
it's impossible to mess up.

06:54.373 --> 06:55.841
You don't even have
to take notes,

06:55.908 --> 06:57.042
you just have to fucking listen.

06:57.109 --> 06:58.811
Hey Brad, when do you think
Lanky's coming?

06:58.878 --> 07:00.179
How the fuck should I know?

07:00.246 --> 07:01.480
He never said he knew
when Lanky was coming.

07:01.547 --> 07:02.548
Why don't you mind
your own business, Kira?

07:02.615 --> 07:05.384
Why don't you go
jack off, Dean?

07:05.451 --> 07:07.486
How's the other thing
where you read backwards?

07:07.553 --> 07:08.854
Or like, a learning disability.

07:08.921 --> 07:11.824
I don't have a learning
disability. I was all honors.

07:11.891 --> 07:13.325
- Not anymore, you're not.
- But I was,

07:13.392 --> 07:16.028
and if you were ever all honors,
you're still considered smart

07:16.095 --> 07:17.863
even if you're not all honors
anymore.

07:17.930 --> 07:19.365
You should do BOUNCE, Shel.

07:19.431 --> 07:22.001
- I'm not doing BOUNCE.
- What's BOUNCE?

07:22.067 --> 07:23.035
It's a program for dumb people

07:23.102 --> 07:24.837
or kids
who are learning disabled.

07:24.904 --> 07:26.305
I'm not learning disabled.

07:26.372 --> 07:27.773
Or kids have to learn a trade,

07:27.840 --> 07:30.109
like being an auto mechanic
that can't do anything real.

07:30.176 --> 07:32.511
Bored of United Cooperative
Education. BOUNCE.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.013
Bored of United

07:34.079 --> 07:35.948
Cooperative Education.

07:37.183 --> 07:39.351
They have this class
called "Life Skills".

07:39.418 --> 07:41.887
So like, instead of doing
Cam or Trig or whatever,

07:41.954 --> 07:44.056
you learn how to cook
or use a checkbook,

07:44.123 --> 07:45.758
and you get high school credits
for it.

07:45.824 --> 07:46.859
For doing a checkbook?

07:46.926 --> 07:48.227
And for carpentry, plumbing...

07:48.294 --> 07:49.562
BOUNCE is actually starting
to sound pretty good.

07:49.628 --> 07:53.032
- Plumbing Missy?
- Yeah, plumbing and other stuff.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.767
Why do you know so much
about plumbing?

07:54.833 --> 07:56.135
I don't Kira, okay.

07:56.202 --> 07:59.171
I'm just saying some of
the things they do at BOUNCE.

08:23.462 --> 08:26.298
Oh, wow. Look at these clowns.

08:26.365 --> 08:28.500
Some kids in line said
Brad and Steph are back here.

08:28.567 --> 08:31.937
- Hey, Lanky.
- Lanky, what's going on?

08:32.004 --> 08:33.906
Nothing man,
everything's excellent.

08:33.973 --> 08:36.342
- Hi, we were just...
- ...waiting to get inside.

08:36.408 --> 08:39.345
- Hoping to get inside.
- We're getting inside.

08:39.411 --> 08:41.814
Holy wow, Brad.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.582
Hey man, what's new?

08:43.649 --> 08:44.817
What's up, Lanky?

08:44.883 --> 08:48.087
Nothing man,
everything's really excellent.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.955
Really, really excellent.

08:50.022 --> 08:51.991
Yeah, cool, cool.

08:52.057 --> 08:53.292
So...

08:53.359 --> 08:55.361
when are you coming back
to school?

08:55.427 --> 08:58.097
I can go back whenever. It's not
like a big deal or anything.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.966
I haven't seen you clowns.

09:01.033 --> 09:02.835
You guys heard about
the UFOs, right?

09:02.901 --> 09:04.403
There aren't any UFOs.

09:04.470 --> 09:05.804
Right on, man.

09:05.871 --> 09:08.474
Just some crazy adults
smoking too much dope, right?

09:08.540 --> 09:11.043
I mean, there might be UFOs.

09:11.110 --> 09:12.278
Brad, hey, you're playing...
you're playing soccer

09:12.344 --> 09:14.146
this year, right?
You're playing, right?

09:14.213 --> 09:15.514
Yeah, I'm playing, Lanky.

09:15.581 --> 09:17.349
Brad's playing select.
It's like the whole county.

09:17.416 --> 09:19.084
It's like he's too good
just for Brighton.

09:19.151 --> 09:21.153
God, you're such
a kiss-ass, Dean.

09:21.220 --> 09:22.521
I'm just telling Lanky,
'cause...

09:22.588 --> 09:25.257
'cause Brad's over there
and he's-he's doing something.

09:25.324 --> 09:26.925
Yeah,
I'm going to be playing too.

09:26.992 --> 09:28.060
Where I am, there's,
like, a field

09:28.127 --> 09:30.162
and I'm definitely
gonna be playing.

09:30.929 --> 09:32.431
When are you coming back?

09:32.498 --> 09:35.434
I can come back whenever.
I already said that.

09:35.501 --> 09:36.969
Yeah, right.

09:38.604 --> 09:42.141
Holy wow, James.

09:44.276 --> 09:47.579
I didn't recognize you.

09:47.646 --> 09:50.549
- It's me, James.
- Oh, wow, you...

09:50.616 --> 09:52.584
you really grew.

09:54.687 --> 09:56.555
You really grew.

09:58.190 --> 09:59.191
I grew.

09:59.258 --> 10:00.592
What do you even
do there, Lanky?

10:00.659 --> 10:02.194
Asshole, don't ask him.

10:02.261 --> 10:04.063
It's just a question, Kira.

10:04.129 --> 10:06.432
Now, you guys don't have
to be all weird or anything.

10:06.498 --> 10:09.134
I'm not gonna like
freak out or anything.

10:09.201 --> 10:11.470
No, it's all really excellent.

10:11.537 --> 10:13.539
So what's it like?

10:13.605 --> 10:15.574
It's not even what everybody
thinks, you know.

10:15.641 --> 10:18.610
You kinda just sit around
and bullshit and stuff.

10:18.677 --> 10:22.081
And everyone smokes,
and we're all really grateful.

10:22.147 --> 10:24.650
And sometimes,
I talk to this doctor guy

10:24.717 --> 10:26.919
about my-my brother
offing himself,

10:26.985 --> 10:28.253
and he's pretty all right.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.924
Uh, did you do
school stuff, like tests?

10:34.059 --> 10:36.462
No. Man, no tests, no quizzes.

10:36.528 --> 10:39.198
No quizzes.
Perfect for you, Shel.

10:40.999 --> 10:42.534
Uh, how'd you get here, Lanky?

10:42.601 --> 10:44.536
Oh, Billy Tate. He's a loon.

10:44.603 --> 10:47.272
He's got these smokes and
they're dipped in this stuff.

10:47.339 --> 10:49.074
He's selling them
for 10 bucks each.

10:49.141 --> 10:50.442
He's a fucking loon.

10:50.509 --> 10:52.077
Is that one?

10:52.144 --> 10:54.546
Um, no, no.
I'm taking these pills

10:54.613 --> 10:57.216
that they only give out
in Britain, England,

10:57.282 --> 11:00.486
and the doctor said I can't
like, put stuff on top of it

11:00.552 --> 11:03.555
because it'll like fuck up my
brain connections or some shit.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.023
What kind of pills?

11:05.090 --> 11:07.359
Uh, there's these things.
They're from Britain, England.

11:07.426 --> 11:09.395
They're doing studies
or something, here.

11:09.461 --> 11:12.297
So I get them as like a tester
for free.

11:13.767 --> 11:15.134
Yeah, Billy Tate knows.
Frankie has got

11:15.200 --> 11:17.369
like a bunch of these kids
who he wants to get in to the...

11:17.436 --> 11:20.506
These kids are practically
begging to get in.

11:20.572 --> 11:22.074
We're trying to get in.

11:22.141 --> 11:24.109
Oh, Billy Tate will get you in.

11:24.176 --> 11:25.477
They'll get all you clowns in,
all right?

11:25.544 --> 11:27.379
I'll go back and get him
and I'll bring him back here.

11:27.446 --> 11:29.314
He'll get all you clowns in,
all right.

11:29.381 --> 11:31.751
I'll catch you clowns later.

11:35.387 --> 11:38.090
We don't need Billy Tate
to get us in.

11:38.157 --> 11:40.092
- Is he really coming back?
- He's a psycho.

11:40.159 --> 11:41.427
- Shut up, Kira.
- He can't come back.

11:41.493 --> 11:42.729
You can't do what Lanky did
and just come back.

11:42.796 --> 11:45.631
Lanky was a psycho
before everything happened.

11:45.697 --> 11:46.999
He said he's coming back.

11:47.065 --> 11:49.067
Look, he's not coming back.

11:49.134 --> 11:51.036
Stop talking about whether
or not he's coming back.

11:51.103 --> 11:52.371
It's pissing me off.

11:58.076 --> 12:00.379
Holy shit, what was that?

12:00.446 --> 12:03.148
Probably an excavator
like a backhoe or something.

12:03.215 --> 12:04.383
Will they ever go home?

12:04.450 --> 12:05.752
They're behind
so they have to work

12:05.819 --> 12:07.352
like 24 hours to finish.

12:07.419 --> 12:09.154
- That's what Mark said.
- Who's Mark?

12:09.221 --> 12:11.423
Uh, he's my stepfather.
He works there.

12:11.490 --> 12:13.425
Well, not in there,
but at the IMT Headquarters

12:13.492 --> 12:16.128
down county. You know, two
of the workers died in there.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.496
Just one died.

12:17.563 --> 12:18.964
No, it's two. One guy fell off
the thing, the other guy

12:19.031 --> 12:21.567
got hit in the head and was fine
but died later. It's like...

12:21.633 --> 12:24.269
no one knew anything was wrong
with him, then he just died.

12:24.336 --> 12:26.271
But it's not death
because of the head thing.

12:26.338 --> 12:28.140
Who gives a shit
what it was, man?

12:28.207 --> 12:29.408
They're just dead.

12:30.242 --> 12:31.543
Hey, you know, my parents,

12:31.610 --> 12:34.112
they say it's jinxed 'cause of
all the kids that died.

12:34.179 --> 12:35.714
It's jinxed because of
the kids that died

12:35.782 --> 12:36.783
or kids died
because it's jinxed?

12:36.850 --> 12:37.983
It's not jinxed.

12:38.050 --> 12:40.452
Seven kids died last year.
That's jinxed.

12:40.519 --> 12:41.720
It's not seven.
They say it's seven

12:41.788 --> 12:43.188
with the Brighton seven thing,
but it's not.

12:43.255 --> 12:46.091
It's seven, okay. Chris Murco
got hit by the speedboat.

12:46.158 --> 12:47.559
Dave Starks died
on the motorcycle.

12:47.626 --> 12:49.528
- And then the foreign exchanger.
- Yeah, the-the Belgian girl

12:49.595 --> 12:50.830
who fell off the bridge
at Harmon Den.

12:50.897 --> 12:52.297
- Eveline.
- Yeah.

12:52.364 --> 12:54.433
And then, uh, Scott Murphy died
when he was standing on the car.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.869
- So that's four.
- That's four.

12:55.935 --> 12:58.136
Uh, and then the other guy
on the same day, from drugs.

12:58.203 --> 12:59.671
The one who works
at the orchard.

12:59.739 --> 13:00.773
No one really knew him, but he
still went to the high school.

13:00.840 --> 13:04.443
Yeah, uh, Glen Barber.
Angel Dust.

13:04.510 --> 13:06.545
I thought he went to BOUNCE,
Glen Barber.

13:06.612 --> 13:08.046
Don't make fun of it, Dean.
God!

13:08.113 --> 13:10.315
Well, I'm just saying maybe the
reason no one knew Glen Barber

13:10.382 --> 13:12.384
is 'cause he went to BOUNCE.
I'm not making fun of it.

13:14.286 --> 13:15.721
How weird is it that it was
the same day?

13:15.788 --> 13:18.624
I mean what are the chances that
two kids die on the same day?

13:18.690 --> 13:21.627
In this town,
they're pretty fucking good.

13:21.693 --> 13:23.863
And then, Lanky's brother.

13:23.930 --> 13:25.664
And Lanky's brother's
girlfriend.

13:27.800 --> 13:28.935
But that's what I mean.

13:29.002 --> 13:30.302
Lanky's brother's girlfriend
went to Belmont.

13:30.369 --> 13:33.639
- She doesn't count.
- No, it still counts, asshole.

13:33.705 --> 13:36.341
- Just not in the Brighton count.
- The death count.

13:36.408 --> 13:37.709
I know,
but when you don't include

13:37.777 --> 13:40.245
Lanky's brother's girlfriend,
it makes six, not seven.

13:40.312 --> 13:42.147
It's like Friday
the fucking 13th here.

13:42.214 --> 13:43.382
Everyone dies.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.684
No, everyone doesn't die.

13:45.752 --> 13:48.387
There's 326 kids in high school,

13:48.453 --> 13:51.423
and seven of them died
last year.

13:51.490 --> 13:53.325
- That's...
- It's a lot of people.

13:53.392 --> 13:54.593
I mean,
it really is jinxed here.

13:54.660 --> 13:56.328
It's just coincidence.
Things aren't jinxed.

13:56.395 --> 13:57.229
You don't think things
are jinxed

13:57.296 --> 13:58.463
but you think there are UFOs?

13:58.530 --> 14:00.599
I didn't say there were UFOs.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.803
What are you doing Kira?
It's garbage.

14:03.870 --> 14:06.438
James, help me.

14:06.505 --> 14:09.274
There is something seriously
wrong with you, Kira.

14:09.341 --> 14:11.677
- It's 2.28 percent.
- What is?

14:11.744 --> 14:14.413
2.28 percent of all the high
school kids died last year

14:14.479 --> 14:16.816
and that's not including
Lanky's brother's girlfriend.

14:16.883 --> 14:18.250
From the suicide pact.

15:33.525 --> 15:34.861
It wasn't a pact, Dean.

15:36.495 --> 15:37.897
It wasn't a suicide pact.

15:37.964 --> 15:40.465
It was a pact. Lanky's brother,
Lanky's brother's girlfriend

15:40.532 --> 15:41.600
was a suicide pact.

15:41.667 --> 15:43.235
But it wasn't like
an official pact.

15:43.301 --> 15:44.603
Shut up, Shel.

15:44.670 --> 15:46.571
It wasn't official,
you mean it wasn't sanctioned

15:46.638 --> 15:48.407
by the
International Suicide Committee?

15:48.473 --> 15:50.642
No, shut up. I mean,
Lanky's brother's girlfriend

15:50.709 --> 15:52.678
did it in the bathroom
at the drive-in, okay?

15:52.745 --> 15:54.579
And she only did it, because
there's a scene in the movie

15:54.646 --> 15:55.647
where the guy
did the same thing.

15:55.714 --> 15:56.983
No, everyone knows
what happened.

15:57.050 --> 15:59.584
Lanky's brother did the same
thing a few weeks later.

15:59.651 --> 16:02.688
So, that's not a pact.
He's just doing the same thing.

16:02.755 --> 16:03.956
Ow! What the hell, man.

16:04.023 --> 16:06.425
I said shut the fuck up
about it.

16:06.491 --> 16:07.626
Lanky's brother's dead,

16:07.693 --> 16:08.694
and Lanky's brother's
girlfriend's dead

16:08.761 --> 16:09.594
so it doesn't matter
what it was.

16:09.661 --> 16:11.864
So, shut the fuck up about it.

16:33.585 --> 16:36.455
Hey Dean,
who's in line up front more?

16:36.521 --> 16:38.590
Uh, I don't know most of them.

16:39.558 --> 16:41.560
I think it's little
Belmont kids.

16:42.627 --> 16:45.998
Tim Zito's there, Gico,
Holly Handley.

16:46.065 --> 16:47.632
Hard rock Holly.

16:51.104 --> 16:52.138
The new girl's there.

16:52.205 --> 16:53.906
- Kate.
- Aw, the new girl, Kate, is hot.

16:53.973 --> 16:55.273
New girl, Kate, is not hot.

16:55.340 --> 16:57.342
Maybe, not hot,
but she's definitely pretty.

16:57.409 --> 16:58.543
She's definitely pretty,
right Brad?

16:58.610 --> 17:01.379
She's all right, I guess.
I don't know.

17:01.446 --> 17:03.783
She's definitely,
at least, pretty.

17:04.851 --> 17:06.886
- She's maybe even hot.
- No, she's new.

17:06.953 --> 17:07.987
Okay, there's a big difference

17:08.054 --> 17:09.721
between being pretty
and being new.

17:10.957 --> 17:12.624
Who else is there?

17:12.691 --> 17:15.460
Uh, Frank Borts,
Tanya and Tiffany.

17:15.527 --> 17:17.496
- Tanya and Tiffany are here?
- Yeah.

17:23.635 --> 17:24.871
What are you listening to?

17:24.937 --> 17:26.271
- U2.
- <i>War?</i>

17:26.338 --> 17:27.539
- <i>Blood Red Sky.</i>
- <i>War's better.</i>

17:27.606 --> 17:29.474
How is it better?
It's like the same songs.

17:29.541 --> 17:30.877
It just is.

17:35.948 --> 17:37.750
- U2 sucks.
- What?

17:37.817 --> 17:40.652
- U2, they suck.
- They do not. Go away.

17:40.719 --> 17:43.022
They suck and they stole
their sound.

17:43.089 --> 17:44.456
- From who?
- The Alarm.

17:44.523 --> 17:46.625
- The Alarm?
- The Alarm.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.795
Trust me, no one stole
their sound from The Alarm.

17:48.861 --> 17:50.295
Leave me alone.

17:50.362 --> 17:52.965
Yeah, well, in five years we'll
see who's still around, okay?

18:06.078 --> 18:09.414
Shit, it's Rizzo. Now, we're
definitely not getting in.

18:15.087 --> 18:17.689
5-liter V8 180 horsepower.

18:17.757 --> 18:19.691
This thing kicks so much ass.

18:47.485 --> 18:49.121
- Hey, Shelby!
- Oh, uh...

18:50.156 --> 18:51.556
Hey, Amy!

18:51.623 --> 18:54.961
I saw Brad in line and he said
you were back here, so...

18:55.027 --> 18:57.429
Yeah, I'm just...

18:57.495 --> 19:00.665
- Lanky's here.
- Uh, yeah, I know he's here.

19:00.733 --> 19:01.968
- He was just...
- Yeah.

19:02.034 --> 19:05.670
Everyone's telling everyone else
that Lanky's here.

19:05.738 --> 19:07.639
Yeah. We-we talked to him.

19:07.706 --> 19:09.641
You know,
he's coming back to school.

19:09.708 --> 19:12.044
Can he really just come back?
I mean, after...

19:12.111 --> 19:13.612
what he did?

19:13.678 --> 19:15.380
Maybe, he can come back, right?

19:21.087 --> 19:22.188
I'm here with Claudia.

19:22.255 --> 19:24.656
Uh, yeah,
it-it's a really long line.

19:24.723 --> 19:26.691
Yeah, but I heard
it's great inside.

19:26.759 --> 19:29.061
Yeah I... I think it'll be
pretty cool.

19:29.128 --> 19:30.263
It's not gonna be cool.

19:30.329 --> 19:32.899
Have any of you poptarts
ever been inside before?

19:32.965 --> 19:35.500
Why don't you leave if you think
it's going to suck so much Kira?

19:37.770 --> 19:38.938
That's a really big backpack.

19:39.005 --> 19:41.706
Uh, yeah...
I'm staying at Brad's tonight,

19:41.774 --> 19:43.608
so it's just stuff
for staying over.

19:43.675 --> 19:44.911
Brad was with Tanya and Tiffany.

19:44.977 --> 19:46.913
I think they went up
to the construction site.

19:46.979 --> 19:50.049
Uh, yeah,
Tanya and Tiffany are here.

19:50.116 --> 19:52.818
- T and T.
- What?

19:52.885 --> 19:55.922
T and T? Tanya and Tiffany.

19:55.988 --> 19:58.758
Some of the drama guys
came up with the funniest names

19:58.824 --> 20:00.226
for Tanya and Tiffany.

20:00.293 --> 20:01.894
- Like Mike Grandy?
- Yeah.

20:01.961 --> 20:04.030
He calls them T and T.
And Doffer, right?

20:04.096 --> 20:05.664
Yeah, Doffer.

20:05.731 --> 20:08.633
He came up with
"The Flying Velcro Twins".

20:10.236 --> 20:12.138
I know those guys.

20:14.006 --> 20:16.842
- We're doing <i>Our Town.</i>
- What about our town?

20:16.909 --> 20:19.912
No, the play,
we're doing <i>Our Town in drama.</i>

20:19.979 --> 20:22.514
<i>Our Town? I mean, isn't that</i>
a little old fashioned

20:22.580 --> 20:24.516
you know, like,
hokey and all that?

20:24.582 --> 20:27.086
I don't think so.
I may have thought that

20:27.153 --> 20:30.056
because it seems like a play,
you know, that a...

20:30.122 --> 20:32.191
bunch of little kids would do
or something.

20:32.258 --> 20:36.695
But, it's really amazing
once you get into it. It's...

20:36.762 --> 20:39.531
all of that how things
always change

20:39.597 --> 20:41.867
and how people take life
for granted.

20:43.102 --> 20:45.104
And a bunch of other stuff.

20:50.876 --> 20:53.112
You should come back to drama.

20:53.179 --> 20:55.613
It was so fun
when we did <i>Pippin, remember?</i>

20:55.680 --> 20:57.116
I... You know, I can't
this year, because...

20:57.183 --> 20:58.751
What are you guys talking about?

20:58.818 --> 21:01.220
I'm trying to get Shelby
to do drama.

21:01.287 --> 21:04.156
- We're doing <i>Our Town.</i>
- Great play. Great play.

21:04.223 --> 21:05.623
You've seen it?

21:05.690 --> 21:08.794
Nah, I just read it one night
while I was doing nothing.

21:08.861 --> 21:12.564
Well, you should tell Shel to do
it, so he can really see it.

21:12.630 --> 21:15.801
I was just telling him, it's
really not too late to join up.

21:15.868 --> 21:19.805
Yeah, definitely, Shel man.
It's a good play.

21:19.872 --> 21:22.341
I-I can't. I have soccer.

21:22.408 --> 21:24.709
- Do both.
- I don't know.

21:26.644 --> 21:27.880
I have to go wait in line
with Claudia,

21:27.947 --> 21:30.016
but I'll come back after
for sure.

21:30.082 --> 21:31.683
Okay.

21:31.751 --> 21:32.852
I hope we get in tonight.

21:32.918 --> 21:35.154
Yeah, we'll all get in.
Everyone gets in.

21:39.325 --> 21:40.993
Shelby...

21:41.060 --> 21:42.762
"You've gotta love life
to have life.

21:42.828 --> 21:44.764
You've gotta have life
to love life."

21:47.033 --> 21:49.735
It's my favorite line
from <i>Our Town.</i>

21:49.802 --> 21:51.804
Really makes you think,
you know.

21:56.876 --> 21:58.944
Why don't you do the play, man?
You like that kind of stuff.

21:59.011 --> 22:00.678
Well, why don't you do it?

22:00.746 --> 22:02.014
I have selects.

22:02.081 --> 22:04.283
But you'd do it if you could?

22:04.350 --> 22:06.352
I'll do it if I wanted to.

22:06.419 --> 22:08.054
I don't know if I want to.

22:08.888 --> 22:11.757
You know, she likes you. Amy.

22:11.824 --> 22:13.691
I guess, maybe.

22:13.759 --> 22:15.895
You should go out with her.

22:15.961 --> 22:18.130
I don't know if I want to.

22:18.197 --> 22:21.167
You know, why don't you just
fool around with her tonight?

22:22.935 --> 22:24.904
Maybe.
I mean, she's cute, right?

22:24.970 --> 22:27.306
- Yeah, sure.
- You don't think she's cute?

22:27.373 --> 22:29.308
I think she's cute.

22:30.342 --> 22:31.911
Would you go out with her?

22:32.411 --> 22:33.779
If I wanted to, I would.

22:33.846 --> 22:35.247
Would you fool around with her?

22:36.115 --> 22:38.084
Yeah, if I wanted to, I would.

22:38.150 --> 22:39.752
- Head's up, head's up!
- Hey!

22:39.819 --> 22:41.787
Fucking watch it, dude.

22:44.990 --> 22:46.192
How do you know if she'd
fool around with you?

22:46.258 --> 22:48.194
Look, I don't... okay?

22:48.260 --> 22:50.196
If I thought about it
and I decided I wanted

22:50.262 --> 22:52.031
to fool around with her,
then I would.

22:52.098 --> 22:55.267
Obviously, she'd have to wanna
fool around with me too,

22:55.334 --> 22:58.137
but it's not like she asked me.

22:58.204 --> 23:01.207
She'd fool around with you.
Everyone fools around with you.

23:02.975 --> 23:04.944
Why don't you just
fool around with her tonight,

23:05.010 --> 23:07.346
then after, see and really
fool around with her?

23:08.747 --> 23:10.950
Yeah, she definitely means that,
I think.

23:12.485 --> 23:14.286
Yeah, I should just
do it, right?

23:14.353 --> 23:16.956
What's funny?

23:17.022 --> 23:18.723
It's just you. I mean,

23:18.791 --> 23:21.293
fooling around shouldn't feel
like it should.

23:24.196 --> 23:27.766
All right.
I'm really gonna do that, okay?

23:27.833 --> 23:29.301
I'm really gonna do that.

23:34.039 --> 23:35.707
Move it back, please.

23:35.774 --> 23:37.343
Back away.

23:37.409 --> 23:39.111
Come on, I'm not kidding.

23:39.178 --> 23:42.381
Back away
from the fucking door.

23:42.448 --> 23:44.383
Or nobody's getting in.

23:48.254 --> 23:50.990
I thought you said Frankie
was cool and that Rizzo was...

23:51.056 --> 23:53.292
I said Frankie's the cooler one
not the cool one.

23:53.359 --> 23:55.227
I knew we weren't getting in.

23:55.294 --> 23:57.930
You guys should just shut up
for five minutes.

24:31.163 --> 24:32.865
I don't even have
to wait out here.

24:32.932 --> 24:35.134
I can get inside
whenever I want.

24:35.201 --> 24:36.035
Yeah, right.

24:36.101 --> 24:38.237
I can. There's another way in.

24:38.304 --> 24:40.105
- What other way?
- There's no other way.

24:40.172 --> 24:41.240
- Don't listen to her.
- Why're you waiting here with us

24:41.307 --> 24:42.541
if you can get in
whenever you want?

24:42.608 --> 24:45.544
Because I don't feel
like going in yet, Messy.

24:45.611 --> 24:47.446
Seriously, what other way in?

24:47.513 --> 24:48.614
I'm not telling.

24:48.681 --> 24:50.883
You're not telling
because there isn't one.

24:50.950 --> 24:53.085
Over there on the roof,
there's a door.

24:53.152 --> 24:55.854
It goes into an office,
like it sort of opens up

24:55.921 --> 24:57.089
and you walk down.

24:57.156 --> 24:58.324
Well, feel free to go check.

24:58.390 --> 25:01.427
Maybe I will. And James too,
right, James?

25:02.995 --> 25:05.364
- On the roof?
- On the roof.

25:13.239 --> 25:15.407
What time is your sister
getting us tonight,

25:15.474 --> 25:16.775
like if we get in?

25:16.842 --> 25:18.277
You're staying at my house,
so it doesn't matter.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.815
And she's taking me home
in the morning, right?

25:22.881 --> 25:24.450
Yeah, she can take you home
in the morning.

25:29.288 --> 25:32.224
I mean I... I know she can
take me home in the morning,

25:32.291 --> 25:33.859
but does she know
she has to take me home?

25:33.926 --> 25:34.960
Why are you freaking out, Shel?

25:35.027 --> 25:37.496
Look, she can take you home,
okay?

25:37.563 --> 25:40.366
Yeah, uh... it's fine, um...

25:40.432 --> 25:42.167
Yeah, it's just, uh, Mark.

25:42.234 --> 25:44.937
He's coming home tonight
and I have a bunch of stuff

25:45.004 --> 25:46.238
that I have to do around
the house this weekend

25:46.305 --> 25:48.240
and then, if I'm not home
by like nine or ten,

25:48.307 --> 25:49.541
tomorrow's really gonna suck.

25:50.542 --> 25:51.510
You're an idiot.

25:51.577 --> 25:53.379
Fuck off, Dean.
Why am I an idiot?

25:53.445 --> 25:55.281
'Cause you already know
tomorrow's gonna suck

25:55.347 --> 25:56.582
and you still wanna be
on time for it.

25:56.649 --> 25:57.716
You're a sadist, Shel.

25:57.783 --> 25:59.051
He's not a sadist,
he's a masochist.

25:59.118 --> 26:01.920
- I meant masochist.
- A sadist gives all the torture,

26:01.987 --> 26:03.122
- a masochist takes it.
- I know, I know.

26:03.188 --> 26:04.189
- I just mixed it up.
- It's not torture, okay?

26:04.256 --> 26:06.458
It's just stuff
around the house, okay?

26:06.525 --> 26:09.161
I'm sorry, Pete, that we're not
all totally rich like you

26:09.228 --> 26:10.329
and have to do
the yard work ourselves.

26:10.396 --> 26:11.597
What yard work?
Do you live in a farm now,

26:11.664 --> 26:13.532
like
<i>Little House on the Prairie?</i>

26:13.599 --> 26:14.633
Are you Half Pint?

26:14.700 --> 26:16.135
You're so fucking Half Pint,
Shel.

26:16.201 --> 26:20.306
It's just like sweeping the
garage and weeding the steps,

26:20.372 --> 26:21.974
and the solar panels,
they have to be clean.

26:22.041 --> 26:22.875
There's a whole list.

26:22.941 --> 26:24.176
Who the fuck has solar panels?

26:24.243 --> 26:26.011
Mark. Mark has solar panels.

26:26.078 --> 26:28.013
What the fuck are solar panels?

26:28.080 --> 26:30.149
The only time
I've ever seen solar panels

26:30.215 --> 26:31.483
was on <i>60 Minutes.</i>

26:31.550 --> 26:33.118
<i>Who the fuck watches60 Minutes?</i>

26:33.185 --> 26:35.054
They save electricity,
solar panels.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.989
I watch <i>60 Minutes.</i>
Is that lame?

26:37.056 --> 26:39.058
How much do they save, Shel?
The solar panels.

26:39.124 --> 26:40.492
I don't know. I don't do
the bills when they come.

26:40.559 --> 26:42.161
I don't sit there
and write the checks.

26:42.227 --> 26:43.595
If, uh, Shel went to BOUNCE,

26:43.662 --> 26:44.930
he'd know how to write
the checks.

26:47.266 --> 26:50.302
Awesome.
That was fucking awesome, James.

26:51.570 --> 26:54.173
What happens if you're late
tomorrow, Shel, for the chores?

26:54.239 --> 26:56.475
I'll be grounded and I'll have
to do a bunch of shitty stuff

26:56.542 --> 26:58.077
and not the stuff I wanna do.

26:59.111 --> 27:00.179
What's funny?

27:00.245 --> 27:02.114
You're already grounded.

27:02.181 --> 27:04.350
You're already sweeping garages
and cleaning solar panels.

27:04.416 --> 27:07.019
- That's grounded.
- I'm not grounded.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.221
Yeah, I'm not grounded.

27:15.694 --> 27:19.164
Hey, Shel, you're, um... you're
taking Spanish this year, right?

27:19.231 --> 27:21.467
Uh, I mean, everyone says
it's easier to do French, so...

27:21.533 --> 27:24.436
Yeah, I-I think French
is harder at first, but...

27:24.503 --> 27:27.373
when you kinda get used to it...
It's like the way

27:27.439 --> 27:30.576
you speak French is harder than
the actual French, you know.

27:30.642 --> 27:32.378
Yeah, maybe that's true.

27:35.614 --> 27:37.216
Are those Capezios?

27:37.282 --> 27:39.118
No, uh,
they're just these things.

27:40.552 --> 27:43.956
They're really, really white.

27:44.022 --> 27:46.058
Uh, yeah,
they're pretty new, so...

27:50.129 --> 27:53.132
Uh... Amy, maybe, uh,
do you wanna go to the...

27:53.198 --> 27:54.666
- construction site, and...
- Yeah, sure.

27:54.734 --> 27:56.435
I mean, we're just waiting
in line.

27:58.036 --> 27:59.638
Yeah, uh,
we're just waiting in line.

28:00.706 --> 28:02.441
- Okay.
- Yeah.

28:20.459 --> 28:22.995
What happened, Kira,
in the newspaper?

28:23.061 --> 28:25.397
- 21 killed.
- 21 what?

28:26.833 --> 28:29.468
- 21 people, Messy.
- Fuck you, freak Kira..

28:29.535 --> 28:30.636
Okay, I said
stop calling me that.

28:30.702 --> 28:33.505
Who do you think I meant,
21 walruses?

28:33.572 --> 28:34.741
How should I know?

28:34.808 --> 28:36.675
Kira, you're so weird,
it could mean anything.

28:36.743 --> 28:38.577
Oh, I'm weird?

28:38.644 --> 28:41.046
I'm not the one who went to
Aaron Palmer's slumber party...

28:41.113 --> 28:43.549
- Shut up, Kira.
- ...and made such a mess.

28:43.615 --> 28:45.017
What mess?
What is she talking about?

28:45.083 --> 28:46.118
Nothing, Dean!

28:46.185 --> 28:48.187
Okay?
Just mind your own business.

28:51.123 --> 28:54.726
21 people killed
at a McDonalds in California.

28:54.794 --> 28:55.862
From what, the food?

28:55.929 --> 28:59.131
No, from a fucking psycho
with guns.

28:59.198 --> 29:01.300
21 people.

29:01.366 --> 29:04.536
A four year old kid. I mean,
what the fuck, right?

29:05.738 --> 29:07.306
What the fuck?

29:07.372 --> 29:08.974
What the fuck?

29:11.677 --> 29:15.180
Um, are your parents going
to that UFO meeting tonight?

29:15.247 --> 29:16.515
Uh, I think so.

29:16.582 --> 29:18.684
Well, I mean, not my dad
'cause he doesn't live here,

29:18.751 --> 29:19.752
but my mom is.

29:19.819 --> 29:21.320
And Mark.

29:21.386 --> 29:22.387
My mother's not going.

29:22.454 --> 29:24.757
She didn't think
the UFOs were real.

29:24.824 --> 29:27.593
They definitely were not UFOs.

29:27.659 --> 29:29.094
Why not? I mean...

29:29.161 --> 29:33.232
something has to be out there,
right? I mean... somewhere.

29:33.298 --> 29:36.201
We'd probably know about it
by now, right?

29:36.268 --> 29:39.204
I guess. But, I-I feel it's...

29:39.271 --> 29:43.075
more like something just...
you feel.

29:43.141 --> 29:46.245
You know, like there's
something more.

29:47.713 --> 29:50.549
I don't think I feel anything.

29:56.890 --> 29:59.625
Do you still go to his house
every other weekends,

29:59.691 --> 30:00.726
you know, your dad's?

30:00.793 --> 30:02.762
Uh, mostly, yeah.

30:02.829 --> 30:06.131
Except my dad sort of...
can't come to the house anymore

30:06.198 --> 30:08.333
to pick me and my sister up.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.167
Why not?

30:09.234 --> 30:11.370
It's just this... thing...

30:11.436 --> 30:14.373
that happened with my dad and
Mark, you know, my stepfather.

30:14.439 --> 30:16.108
It's just this thing
that happened.

30:16.174 --> 30:19.378
Yeah, but now he can't come
pick you up?

30:19.444 --> 30:20.880
I mean, what happened?

30:20.947 --> 30:25.450
Uh, it's not a big deal, but...
my dad, he came to pick us up

30:25.517 --> 30:26.953
and when he pulled in
to the driveway

30:27.020 --> 30:30.389
he sort of went close to Mark's
car with his van, by accident.

30:30.455 --> 30:33.525
- Well, did he hit it?
- Well, not at first, but...

30:33.592 --> 30:35.795
if he backed out,
his back bumper

30:35.862 --> 30:36.930
would scrape Mark's bumper

30:36.996 --> 30:39.431
or like the part next
to the bumper,

30:39.498 --> 30:42.267
but my sister said to go get
Mark so he can move his car

30:42.334 --> 30:43.468
even though
he'd be pissed about it.

30:43.535 --> 30:44.938
Well, did you get him anyway?

30:45.004 --> 30:48.775
No, my dad just backed out
and hit Mark's car pretty bad.

30:48.841 --> 30:51.343
Not really bad, but pretty bad.

30:51.410 --> 30:53.813
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

30:53.880 --> 30:57.282
And so, Mark came out, 'cause
he was watching from inside,

30:57.349 --> 30:58.751
he was yelling.

30:58.818 --> 31:01.420
And my dad got out of the van.
They got all face to face.

31:01.486 --> 31:05.724
Oh, god... Shel, what happened?

31:05.792 --> 31:09.896
It's not a big deal or anything,
but I was watching

31:09.963 --> 31:14.166
and Mark, he was saying stuff
like my dad's a loser,

31:14.232 --> 31:15.835
you know, stuff like that,
and then...

31:16.836 --> 31:18.303
What?

31:19.638 --> 31:21.306
Mark hit my dad.

31:21.373 --> 31:22.407
Oh, my god, Shelby.

31:22.474 --> 31:24.844
Mark hit my dad
and my sister yelled.

31:26.511 --> 31:28.614
Well, what did your dad do?

31:28.680 --> 31:30.449
I don't know. He did...

31:30.515 --> 31:31.784
nothing.

31:31.851 --> 31:35.955
He did this, like, smile,
like it didn't matter,

31:36.022 --> 31:38.190
like it didn't hurt him.

31:38.256 --> 31:40.359
Or like, like, he was above it,
you know.

31:40.425 --> 31:42.829
Well, I guess that's good.

31:42.895 --> 31:46.531
Yeah, it's cool he didn't do
anything back, you know.

31:46.598 --> 31:49.267
Yeah, you know,
that-that was pretty cool.

31:49.334 --> 31:52.437
Yeah. Yeah,
it was definitely cool.

31:53.906 --> 31:56.341
So, anyway, my dad can't come
to the house anymore

31:56.408 --> 31:58.143
so we just meet him over
in the Sears parking lot.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.403
Why did he shoot everyone?

32:24.469 --> 32:25.872
The McDonald's guy?

32:25.938 --> 32:28.273
Because he's a fucking psycho.

32:28.340 --> 32:29.608
Yeah, but why?

32:29.675 --> 32:32.511
There's gotta be a better reason
than just he's a psycho.

32:32.577 --> 32:34.546
Here, he left a note.

32:34.613 --> 32:38.617
"Fear of international bankers
that break down society.

32:38.684 --> 32:40.787
Fear of soviet aggression."

32:40.853 --> 32:43.388
Well, he's worried
about the Russians.

32:43.455 --> 32:46.391
The arm's talk is just a trap.
They're gonna bomb us.

32:46.458 --> 32:47.592
You can't trust Russians.

32:48.928 --> 32:50.163
Why is that funny, James?

32:50.228 --> 32:52.631
We-we can't hug our children
with nuclear arms.

32:52.698 --> 32:55.534
War is not healthy for children
or other living things.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.669
What if they gave a war
and nobody cared?

32:59.337 --> 33:01.007
What is that?
What are you saying?

33:01.074 --> 33:04.276
James' mother has all these
magnets that say all the...

33:04.342 --> 33:05.812
like, "No amnesty for Nixon."

33:05.878 --> 33:09.414
The kind of shit
nobody cares about anymore.

33:09.481 --> 33:12.484
She was a hippie, and now,
she's just normal.

33:14.020 --> 33:15.353
God, you guys are so weird.

33:15.420 --> 33:18.623
Read something else, Kira.
Like, what else happened?

33:18.690 --> 33:20.559
A large pile of bullshit.

33:36.441 --> 33:38.477
- Holly Handley's here.
- Hardrock Holly.

33:38.543 --> 33:40.378
It's so funny,

33:40.445 --> 33:42.681
she always wears those shirts.

33:42.749 --> 33:44.583
Yeah, she wore
a "Hardrock London" yesterday.

33:44.649 --> 33:46.685
Right? That's something
in music.

33:47.652 --> 33:49.055
And Lanky, and I just...

33:49.122 --> 33:51.858
I can't believe he's coming back
after, you know, what happened.

33:51.924 --> 33:52.992
His brother.

33:53.059 --> 33:55.494
Well, yeah, and the other stuff.

33:56.628 --> 33:59.564
It's just weird.
He's here with everyone.

33:59.631 --> 34:02.869
Brad knew Lanky's brother.
Like, knew him a lot.

34:02.935 --> 34:04.103
He did?

34:04.170 --> 34:06.538
Brad's sister is friends
with Lanky's brother,

34:06.605 --> 34:09.674
- but Brad knew him too.
- Hm.

34:29.561 --> 34:32.697
Uh, what happened with your dad?

34:33.966 --> 34:36.002
He died, Shelby.

34:41.841 --> 34:45.710
I'm just messing with you.

34:45.778 --> 34:48.680
I know you know,
and that everyone knows.

34:49.916 --> 34:51.918
You should've seen your face
just now.

34:55.687 --> 34:58.157
It's okay, you don't have to,
you know, not talk about it

34:58.224 --> 34:59.959
or pretend it didn't happen.

35:01.227 --> 35:02.929
Did he have cancer?

35:02.995 --> 35:06.933
It wasn't cancer.
It was a lot of things.

35:06.999 --> 35:08.234
And he drank too.

35:08.301 --> 35:11.070
But we didn't really know
about that until after.

35:11.137 --> 35:12.839
I mean, I sort of knew,

35:12.905 --> 35:16.075
I just didn't know
it meant anything.

35:16.142 --> 35:19.178
And I was pretty much a kid
for all that time so...

35:19.245 --> 35:21.413
- Yeah.
- ...what's a kid gonna do?

35:21.479 --> 35:23.950
- You were just a kid then.
- Yeah.

35:24.016 --> 35:27.619
You know, it was just, um,
things Laura and I was used to.

35:28.587 --> 35:30.790
And like, my father, he...

35:30.857 --> 35:34.626
never really knew how he was
gonna be. It's like he...

35:34.693 --> 35:36.796
wasn't even my father anymore.

35:36.863 --> 35:41.801
He was just this thing. I don't
really know how to explain it.

35:41.868 --> 35:43.236
Yeah.

35:43.302 --> 35:46.806
So when he died, it sort of
felt like it was a relief.

35:46.873 --> 35:48.941
You know,
like it already happened.

35:49.775 --> 35:51.777
It was better without him.

35:54.713 --> 35:56.983
I know that sounds weird,

35:57.049 --> 35:58.084
but I mean, it was true.

35:58.150 --> 36:00.552
I've been doing
more things in school.

36:00.619 --> 36:03.789
I'm even doing drama again
and it's so much fun.

36:03.856 --> 36:05.992
It's really not too late
to join up.

36:06.058 --> 36:07.459
I know, but I have soccer.

36:07.525 --> 36:08.895
Oh, you play with Brad, right?

36:08.961 --> 36:11.998
Uh, well no. Brad is...
playing select

36:12.064 --> 36:14.100
with some of the kids he's only
been going to prep with.

36:14.166 --> 36:15.835
What does that mean? Select.

36:15.902 --> 36:18.603
It means Brad's
really good at soccer.

36:18.670 --> 36:19.839
Wow, that's weird,

36:19.906 --> 36:22.507
'cause he's such a great
artist too, you know.

36:22.574 --> 36:24.643
I'm aware.

36:27.947 --> 36:30.482
You know, I-I might be going
to a different school

36:30.548 --> 36:31.716
next year, too.

36:31.784 --> 36:32.484
But it's definitely not like
a prep school

36:32.550 --> 36:34.754
or anything like that.

36:34.820 --> 36:36.521
You're moving, like...

36:36.588 --> 36:38.024
you're not going
to the high school next year?

36:38.090 --> 36:40.826
No, I mean, it's not for sure
but I think...

36:40.893 --> 36:43.628
last year really freaked
my mom out with all the...

36:43.695 --> 36:46.665
deaths and suicides
and everything.

36:48.566 --> 36:49.936
Do you think Brighton's jinxed?

36:50.002 --> 36:53.072
I mean, Pete said we have
a 2.28 percent chances of dying

36:53.139 --> 36:55.041
when we get to the high school
next year.

36:56.776 --> 37:00.712
No, I don't think
Brighton's jinxed.

37:00.780 --> 37:04.016
I just think that's what people
wanna believe.

37:04.083 --> 37:06.518
But why would they
wanna believe that?

37:06.584 --> 37:07.920
I don't know.

37:07.987 --> 37:10.222
Maybe, so they don't have
to believe anything else.

37:41.619 --> 37:43.189
Vanessa Williams nude.

37:43.255 --> 37:45.623
Hey! Yeah!

37:45.690 --> 37:47.193
She can't be
Miss America anymore

37:47.259 --> 37:48.861
because she was in <i>Penthouse.</i>

37:48.928 --> 37:50.730
I saw it in school,
the <i>Penthouse.</i>

37:50.796 --> 37:51.998
Pat Skilly brought it in.

37:52.064 --> 37:54.100
"Pageant officials deemed
that Miss Williams

37:54.166 --> 37:56.736
displayed behavior
unbecoming to the crown."

37:56.802 --> 37:58.738
So she was naked BFD.

37:59.238 --> 38:00.306
What else, Kira?

38:00.373 --> 38:01.741
Nothing. A thing about
that preschool

38:01.807 --> 38:04.609
where the teacher used to
do it with the little kids.

38:04.676 --> 38:06.112
Gross. That is so gross.

38:06.178 --> 38:10.049
There's some bullshit about
that phony fucker Springsteen.

38:10.116 --> 38:12.684
Bruce Springsteen isn't a phony,
Kira. Why'd you say that?

38:12.752 --> 38:14.854
- Because Messy...
- Stop calling me that.

38:14.920 --> 38:17.056
Because he let Reagan use
his song and Reagan sucks.

38:17.123 --> 38:18.424
So that means,
he's just like Reagan

38:18.491 --> 38:20.760
except worse, because he
pretends he's not like Reagan

38:20.826 --> 38:23.129
- which means he's a phony.
- You're so stupid.

38:23.195 --> 38:25.231
Okay, Springsteen told Reagan
he can't use his song,

38:25.297 --> 38:27.199
because he doesn't mean
what he's using it to mean.

38:27.266 --> 38:28.533
He was just on yesterday.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.003
She's right.
Pete, tell your freak girlfriend

38:31.070 --> 38:32.772
- that Springsteen's cool.
- Shut up, Dean.

38:32.838 --> 38:34.740
You shut up. Do another, Kira.

38:34.807 --> 38:35.908
Don't. Shut up.

38:35.975 --> 38:37.709
No one cares about
your current events.

38:37.777 --> 38:39.779
No, you poptarts need
to know stuff.

38:39.845 --> 38:41.613
Everything is crazy,
and everyone is crazy,

38:41.679 --> 38:42.647
and no one's paying attention.

38:42.714 --> 38:44.216
Christ, Kira, can
you just relax?

38:44.283 --> 38:45.518
You're a shithead, Dean.

38:45.583 --> 38:46.752
You think you're smart,
but you're not even smart.

38:46.819 --> 38:49.255
You just read stuff, hear stuff,
repeat it all.

38:49.321 --> 38:50.356
You're a repeater.

38:50.423 --> 38:51.689
That's so stupid, Kira.

38:51.757 --> 38:53.859
Why are you so weird?
Why do you dress like that

38:53.926 --> 38:54.894
and act so weird?

38:54.960 --> 38:57.763
- She's not weird.
- She is.

38:57.830 --> 38:59.198
And so are you, James,

38:59.265 --> 39:01.367
because you're drawing faces
and taping them to a wall.

39:01.434 --> 39:02.634
That's not weird?

39:02.700 --> 39:04.336
It's the Brighton seven.

39:04.403 --> 39:07.907
Brighton seven.
Are you kidding me?

39:07.973 --> 39:10.176
God, you guys are so freaky.

39:10.242 --> 39:11.377
Why are you like that, Kira?

39:11.444 --> 39:12.311
She thinks she's too good
for everyone.

39:12.378 --> 39:14.646
- Maybe I am.
- No.

39:14.712 --> 39:16.115
She thinks she's
too bad for everyone.

39:16.182 --> 39:17.582
That's the real problem.

39:17.649 --> 39:19.752
It's like you guys couldn't
be normal so you become this

39:19.819 --> 39:22.687
and you pretend like you
wanna be this way all along.

39:22.755 --> 39:24.656
No one thinks like this
because you wanna be.

39:24.722 --> 39:26.325
- Dean, cut it out.
- No.

39:26.392 --> 39:27.426
She pretends she's not friends

39:27.493 --> 39:28.327
with anyone anymore
out of choice.

39:28.394 --> 39:30.796
It's not out of choice, Kira.

39:30.863 --> 39:31.997
I'm not friends with you all
anymore

39:32.064 --> 39:32.865
'cause you're all poptarts.
All of you.

39:32.932 --> 39:34.400
You're all fucking poptarts!

39:34.467 --> 39:36.068
You ever just shut the fuck up?

39:49.949 --> 39:50.983
Where's the beef?

39:51.050 --> 39:52.918
That's the big
goddamn question, James.

39:52.985 --> 39:54.286
Where is the beef?

40:02.995 --> 40:04.964
What's in the backpack?

40:05.030 --> 40:06.732
Um, I'm staying
at Brad's tonight

40:06.799 --> 40:08.700
so it's just stuff
for staying over.

40:08.767 --> 40:11.636
Yeah, but there's so much.
What's in it?

40:14.440 --> 40:15.741
- No way.
- Oh, yeah?

40:15.808 --> 40:17.209
- Nice try.
- Come on.

40:17.276 --> 40:22.982
Stop bro. Stop being so...
weird about it.

40:23.048 --> 40:26.252
I've seen guys' underwear
before, Shelby.

40:26.318 --> 40:27.820
So, BFD.

40:27.887 --> 40:29.989
- Big fucking deal.
- Mm.

40:30.055 --> 40:32.791
- It's gonna be cold later, so...
- Oh, yeah.

40:32.858 --> 40:35.261
Be prepared. Cub scouts.

40:35.327 --> 40:37.129
Boy scouts, but...

40:37.196 --> 40:38.397
Got it.

40:38.464 --> 40:40.266
All right, let's see.

40:40.332 --> 40:44.470
You've got clothes,
a flashlight,

40:44.537 --> 40:47.139
toothbrush, mag...

40:47.206 --> 40:48.741
Whoa...

40:48.807 --> 40:50.176
- Shel.
- Okay, those aren't mine.

40:50.242 --> 40:52.178
- Magazines.
- My stepfather has them,

40:52.244 --> 40:54.747
and Brad.
He wanted me to bring them.

40:54.813 --> 40:55.948
I'm pretty sure
everybody's stepfather

40:56.015 --> 40:57.349
has these type of magazines.

41:00.986 --> 41:02.855
Do you like these women?

41:02.922 --> 41:05.191
I mean, I like them as friends.

41:05.257 --> 41:07.927
No, but I mean like...

41:07.993 --> 41:11.530
do you like them like the way
they look?

41:11.597 --> 41:13.899
I don't know. I don't really...

41:13.966 --> 41:16.035
I mean, I guess
they're pretty okay.

41:24.276 --> 41:25.377
All right.

41:26.579 --> 41:28.247
What else do you have?

41:29.515 --> 41:31.483
You've got some snacks.

41:33.052 --> 41:35.788
Um, music and tapes

41:35.854 --> 41:39.258
which is ZZ Top and The Fixx.
Hm.

41:40.859 --> 41:43.462
- Wait, no.
- Shelby...

41:44.997 --> 41:47.199
- This is a gun.
- No, it's not.

41:47.266 --> 41:48.801
I know what a gun looks like.

41:48.867 --> 41:50.469
It's not like a gun gun.

41:50.536 --> 41:51.537
Why do you have a gun?

41:51.604 --> 41:53.973
Wait, okay. I don't.
It's Mark's.

41:54.039 --> 41:55.474
He has this den
with stuff in it,

41:55.541 --> 41:56.775
and he locks it, but you know,
just like one of those locks

41:56.842 --> 41:58.577
- you know, you just like...
- Yeah, but I mean,

41:58.644 --> 42:00.045
why do you have it? It's a gun.

42:00.112 --> 42:03.449
Wait, just 'cause Brad has
one too, we were just gonna...

42:03.515 --> 42:04.850
mess around, okay?

42:04.917 --> 42:07.286
His mom's in the Bahamas,
we could just do whatever.

42:09.488 --> 42:10.589
Looks really scary.

42:10.656 --> 42:11.857
It's just a BB gun, okay,
and pellets

42:11.924 --> 42:15.261
like you-you just pump it once
and shoot it.

42:15.327 --> 42:17.096
It just stings a little.

42:17.162 --> 42:18.397
Some guys in my neighborhood
do it.

42:18.464 --> 42:19.865
they have one-pump wars

42:19.932 --> 42:23.302
and I don't really do that,
but they do, and it's fine.

42:23.369 --> 42:25.537
Okay, well, what does
two pumps do?

42:25.604 --> 42:27.873
Yeah, these are the pellets.

42:27.940 --> 42:31.310
Two pumps could break
the skin probably.

42:34.313 --> 42:35.447
Okay.

42:35.514 --> 42:38.484
Just point her there
and shoot the thing.

42:45.524 --> 42:49.094
That was... that was awesome.
What does three pumps do?

42:49.161 --> 42:51.030
Uh, well, three pumps
will break the skin

42:51.096 --> 42:53.198
especially with the pellets.

42:53.265 --> 42:54.333
Here.

42:59.872 --> 43:03.342
Okay. Do-do four. Do four.
Come on, do four.

43:11.984 --> 43:13.118
That was awesome.

43:13.185 --> 43:15.454
I guess I'm pretty good at it.

43:22.394 --> 43:26.031
I should probably go see
if Claudia's, you know, talking

43:26.098 --> 43:27.433
- to anyone.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

43:27.499 --> 43:28.901
I... I should have to clean up
all this so I probably

43:28.967 --> 43:31.937
- should go back too, so...
- Yeah, no, I'll-I'll come back

43:32.004 --> 43:33.439
and...
'cause it's fun with you guys.

43:33.505 --> 43:34.573
Yeah, okay. Sure.

43:34.640 --> 43:36.442
- Bye.
- See you, Amy.

44:02.101 --> 44:04.203
I'm trying. I'm trying.
It's too high.

44:04.269 --> 44:05.938
No, it's not.
You're right there.

44:06.004 --> 44:07.139
Just grab the fucking ladder.

44:07.206 --> 44:08.574
Too high. Let me down.

44:19.318 --> 44:22.054
What the fuck
is wrong with them?

46:35.788 --> 46:38.690
- Shut up. Shut up.
- Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

46:48.634 --> 46:51.103
If they're gonna let us in
they should just let us in.

46:51.169 --> 46:53.472
They will.
They pretty much have to.

47:03.682 --> 47:05.717
- What?
- What happened?

47:05.785 --> 47:08.587
- How was it?
- It was okay. I don't know.

47:09.621 --> 47:11.523
Did you fool around?

47:11.590 --> 47:14.426
I don't know.
I mean, not really.

47:14.493 --> 47:16.562
What do you mean? You either
fooled around or you didn't.

47:16.628 --> 47:18.463
I don't know, okay?
I don't know.

47:18.530 --> 47:20.632
Why didn't you fool around?

47:20.699 --> 47:22.301
We just didn't.

47:22.367 --> 47:23.803
Just like, we didn't.

47:23.870 --> 47:26.305
But she went to the construction
site to fool around with you,

47:26.371 --> 47:29.742
- what the fuck happened?
- Nothing happened, okay?

47:29.809 --> 47:31.410
Nothing happened.

47:38.684 --> 47:40.820
Dean, do your parents know
you're here tonight

47:40.887 --> 47:42.922
trying to get in to Polo's?

47:42.989 --> 47:45.157
Do any of our parents
know we're here?

47:45.223 --> 47:47.794
They're all at the UFO meeting.

47:47.860 --> 47:50.763
It's so stupid. UFOs.

47:50.830 --> 47:51.998
There aren't any UFOs.

47:52.065 --> 47:54.299
I'm the one who doesn't think
there are UFOs.

47:54.366 --> 47:55.935
I don't think there are either.

47:56.002 --> 47:57.269
How do you know?

47:57.336 --> 47:59.504
The news said, 9,000 adults
saw the same thing.

47:59.571 --> 48:01.440
The same lights, the same shape.

48:01.506 --> 48:03.442
Derek Scropelli's father
filmed it.

48:03.508 --> 48:05.277
You said that already.
Who cares who filmed it?

48:05.344 --> 48:06.678
Derek Scropelli's father
is like the vice president

48:06.746 --> 48:08.881
- of the computer firm.
- And that makes him an expert

48:08.948 --> 48:10.817
on what's a UFO
and what's not a UFO?

48:12.250 --> 48:14.353
It was like plane formations.

48:18.858 --> 48:20.525
How do you know?

48:20.592 --> 48:24.396
My uncle's friends.
They did the whole thing.

48:24.463 --> 48:26.665
Bullshit. Uncle's friends...

48:26.733 --> 48:28.768
They flew planes with grid
lights all over the place

48:28.835 --> 48:30.903
just to freak everyone out.

48:30.970 --> 48:32.772
It was a hoax, the entire thing.

48:32.839 --> 48:34.139
They also filmed the hoax.

48:34.206 --> 48:35.407
- That's what's weird.
- And you could hear the engines

48:35.474 --> 48:37.509
of the plane and when it flew
under the moon

48:37.576 --> 48:38.577
you could still see the moon.

48:38.644 --> 48:40.747
- So?
- So it wasn't solid.

48:40.813 --> 48:43.482
The film that Derek Scropelli's
dad has is solid

48:43.548 --> 48:45.785
and there were not
any engine sounds.

48:45.852 --> 48:47.319
It's bullshit.

48:47.386 --> 48:49.621
- It's bullshit.
- 9,000 adults saw it.

48:49.688 --> 48:52.691
He's right, Dean.
9,000 adults can't all be crazy.

48:58.563 --> 49:01.366
Where does your mother
think you are, Shel, tonight?

49:01.433 --> 49:02.434
She just thinks I'm at Brad's

49:02.501 --> 49:04.236
so I can't be in trouble
for being here.

49:04.302 --> 49:05.437
Why not?

49:05.504 --> 49:06.705
'Cause I'm just doing
what Brad's doing.

49:06.773 --> 49:07.539
I mean it doesn't count
like it would

49:07.606 --> 49:09.976
if this was a normal day.

49:10.043 --> 49:13.445
What about you, James?
What did you tell your parents?

49:13.512 --> 49:15.380
He didn't tell them anything.

49:15.982 --> 49:18.617
They don't really ask.

49:18.684 --> 49:21.386
He lives in the apartment
above the garage all by himself.

49:21.453 --> 49:23.722
You live in an apartment, James?

49:23.790 --> 49:25.892
God, that's so excellent.
You're so lucky.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.529
Missy, where are you
supposed to be right now?

49:30.595 --> 49:31.798
I'm with Jody Fagan...

49:31.864 --> 49:33.298
Jody Amazing.

49:33.365 --> 49:35.667
...at a place called Polo's
that's like a birthday place.

49:35.735 --> 49:36.936
My parents think I'm eating

49:37.003 --> 49:38.938
Tootsie Rolls
and ice cream cake right now.

49:39.005 --> 49:40.940
Where is Jody Fagan?
She living here?

49:41.007 --> 49:43.675
- I told you she is up in...
- You're such an idiot, Missy.

49:43.743 --> 49:45.544
Jody Fagan isn't hanging out
with you.

49:45.610 --> 49:46.746
She is. She just knows a lot
of Belmont kids...

49:46.813 --> 49:50.282
Jody Fagan used you
for a fucking ride.

49:50.348 --> 49:52.584
Holy shit, when did you get
this stupid?

49:52.651 --> 49:54.653
- Kira, lay off.
- Go to hell, Kira.

49:54.720 --> 49:57.056
We used to make fun
of Jody Fagan, remember?

49:57.123 --> 49:58.423
The "slippery slut"
we called her

49:58.490 --> 49:59.624
because of the Halloween thing.

49:59.691 --> 50:01.861
Hey wait, Jody Fagan's
a "slippery slut"?

50:01.928 --> 50:04.429
I mean, do you actually think
Jody Fagan

50:04.496 --> 50:07.365
would ever wanna be friends
with someone so...

50:07.432 --> 50:08.935
messy?

50:09.001 --> 50:10.469
Why do you keep saying messy?

50:10.535 --> 50:11.703
Yeah, what does that mean?

50:11.771 --> 50:12.805
Yeah, why do you keep
calling her...

50:12.872 --> 50:14.539
Because I peed
in my sleeping bag.

50:16.708 --> 50:19.846
Okay, everyone?
Are you satisfied, Kira?

50:19.912 --> 50:21.748
Is it like the biggest deal
in the world?

50:24.784 --> 50:26.886
I was 12 and I peed
in my sleeping bag

50:26.953 --> 50:29.088
at Aaron Palmer's slumber party.

50:29.155 --> 50:30.655
Is everyone happy now?

50:32.557 --> 50:34.794
Why did you pee
in your sleeping bag?

50:35.828 --> 50:38.931
I don't know.
Why does anyone do anything?

50:38.998 --> 50:39.999
I just did.

50:43.069 --> 50:45.470
That's why Kira calls me Messy.

50:45.537 --> 50:48.273
Get it? 'Cause my name's Missy.

50:49.708 --> 50:51.010
You're such a loser, Kira.

50:52.812 --> 50:55.848
But you know what?
I'm not even mad,

50:55.915 --> 50:57.549
and I don't even care.

50:58.683 --> 51:00.052
I just feel sorry for you.

51:01.553 --> 51:03.455
It really is getting cold.

51:08.493 --> 51:11.130
Kira came with us to the lake
last summer.

51:11.197 --> 51:12.899
I didn't want her to come,
but...

51:12.965 --> 51:16.635
My mom said it seemed like Kira
never did anything fun.

51:16.701 --> 51:18.403
I wasn't really friends
with her anymore

51:18.470 --> 51:21.007
so I hated bringing her.

51:21.073 --> 51:26.879
But, that weekend I realized
I was never friends with her.

51:28.080 --> 51:30.750
That she was just the same age

51:30.817 --> 51:33.451
and around the neighborhood
so we do things together,

51:33.518 --> 51:34.854
like automatically.

51:36.989 --> 51:38.257
But at the lakehouse,

51:38.323 --> 51:40.827
all the summer kids could tell
you were a loser.

51:44.529 --> 51:45.798
And I sort of saw you

51:45.865 --> 51:48.835
for the first time from like
someone else's eyes.

51:50.468 --> 51:53.438
And it was so obvious, god.

51:53.505 --> 51:54.907
I couldn't wait
for that weekend to end,

51:54.974 --> 51:56.909
couldn't wait for you
to go home.

51:58.543 --> 51:59.879
I couldn't wait.

52:05.151 --> 52:07.119
Holy shit, no way, look.

52:09.155 --> 52:14.961
Look, another UFO. I mean,
what are the chances.

52:15.027 --> 52:17.930
We should alert the authorities
for being invaded by aliens.

52:17.997 --> 52:19.564
We've come to get in to Polo's

52:19.631 --> 52:21.700
and we will not wait in line.

52:21.767 --> 52:23.535
Why do you keep doing
robot voice for aliens?

52:23.602 --> 52:24.703
They're aliens.

52:24.770 --> 52:26.205
Ever talked
to an alien before?

52:26.272 --> 52:29.108
How do you know they talk like
robots? They're from the future.

52:29.175 --> 52:30.642
Space isn't the future, idiot.

52:30.709 --> 52:32.644
And robots already exist.

52:34.113 --> 52:36.048
It really is getting cold.

52:36.115 --> 52:38.918
Yeah, sometimes it feels like
there's no fall anymore.

52:38.985 --> 52:41.020
It just goes from summer
to winter here, you know.

52:41.087 --> 52:42.188
It's how it goes every year.

52:42.255 --> 52:43.521
I mean like,
it skips the fall weather.

52:43.588 --> 52:46.125
Like, I fully understand
winter comes after summer...

52:46.192 --> 52:48.227
So fucking annoying.

52:48.294 --> 52:50.963
Arguing about every fucking
thing. You're pissing me off.

52:52.999 --> 52:55.134
It's cold now.
It'll be really cold sooner.

52:55.201 --> 52:57.602
Then there'll be of an
opportunity for snow days.

52:57.669 --> 53:00.039
It's nothing to do with snow,
how cold it is.

53:00.106 --> 53:01.874
It has to be cold to snow.

53:01.941 --> 53:03.976
I-I meant, being cold now
has nothing to do

53:04.043 --> 53:05.912
with whether or not it's gonna
snow more in the winter.

53:05.978 --> 53:09.614
But if it's cold now, then it's
gonna be really cold sooner...

53:09.681 --> 53:12.084
Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up.

53:12.151 --> 53:14.686
You guys are fucking annoying
and I'm sick of it.

53:16.721 --> 53:20.159
Keep fooling around, Dean? Huh?

53:20.226 --> 53:23.561
If you guys are gonna fight
all the time, then do it.

53:23.628 --> 53:25.530
You fucking hate each other.

53:25.597 --> 53:27.967
Yeah, right. I'm...

53:28.034 --> 53:30.903
...not, not gonna fight, not...

53:30.970 --> 53:33.039
They shouldn't hit
each other, Brad.

53:33.105 --> 53:35.041
Come on, Dean.

53:35.107 --> 53:38.110
I don't like to listen
to your fucking bullshit.

53:39.678 --> 53:41.180
- Quit it, Brad.
- Look, shut up, Missy.

53:41.247 --> 53:43.215
I'm fucking tired of these two.

53:43.282 --> 53:44.784
Come on, Pete, fight Dean.

53:44.850 --> 53:46.185
Hey, cut it out.
I don't wanna...

53:46.252 --> 53:47.719
I don't wanna do this.

53:47.787 --> 53:50.823
Goddammit!
Fucking hit each other.

53:50.890 --> 53:53.658
- I'm not...
- Stop it.

53:53.725 --> 53:56.561
- Man, calm down.
- Hey, fuck you too, Shel.

53:56.628 --> 53:58.164
I'm tired of you, too.

53:58.230 --> 54:00.598
Not just fucking
push each other.

54:00.665 --> 54:02.068
There you go.

54:02.134 --> 54:05.137
- Haven't you had enough?
- Guys, stop it, please.

54:05.204 --> 54:06.604
- Brad, stop it!
- Guys, stop!

54:06.671 --> 54:09.241
- Dean, stop. Dean, stop.
- You're crazy, Brad!

54:09.308 --> 54:10.876
Get off me!

54:57.223 --> 54:58.891
Come on, guys.

55:04.997 --> 55:06.198
Hurry up.

55:08.834 --> 55:10.602
What, you all hear that?

55:10.668 --> 55:13.239
My god, we're getting in.

55:13.305 --> 55:15.274
- We're finally getting in.
- Getting in.

55:15.341 --> 55:17.810
You fuckers. We're getting in.

55:20.046 --> 55:23.949
Yeah, they're gonna start
letting in the younger kids now.

55:24.016 --> 55:25.217
Yeah, Billy Tate.
He said that...

55:25.284 --> 55:27.920
all you faggots back here
are gonna get in.

55:27.987 --> 55:29.889
- Fuck you, Lanky.
- Kira, shut up.

55:29.955 --> 55:32.892
- We're getting in.
- I'm just kidding around.

55:32.958 --> 55:34.760
I'm just kidding around.

55:34.827 --> 55:36.796
See, he's just kidding,
Kira. Shut up.

55:36.862 --> 55:39.832
Yeah, Billy Tate.
He's a loon, man.

55:39.899 --> 55:42.735
He gave me these smokes
and said they were regular,

55:42.802 --> 55:44.170
but they're not, they're dipped.

55:44.236 --> 55:46.906
Dipped and dusted,
that's what Billy said.

55:46.972 --> 55:48.207
Lanky, are you all right?

55:48.274 --> 55:53.012
Yeah, I'm doing excellent.
I told you that before.

55:54.380 --> 55:56.348
You-you gotta go back tonight?

55:56.415 --> 55:57.783
I just gotta show up

55:57.850 --> 56:00.820
to show them that I didn't
jump in front of a train,

56:00.886 --> 56:03.989
or smash someone's head in
with a bat. Ha.

56:04.056 --> 56:07.193
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

56:07.259 --> 56:08.861
No one else is coming...

56:08.928 --> 56:11.730
Does anybody wanna smoke
this fatty?

56:11.797 --> 56:13.766
Me and Billy rolled
with this fatty.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.270
Shel, man, you want this.
Right, so...

56:18.337 --> 56:20.106
Uh, no. I don't think so.

56:21.407 --> 56:24.343
Come on, man.

56:24.410 --> 56:25.710
Do you want to?

56:25.778 --> 56:27.679
Hey, shut up Lanky.

56:30.216 --> 56:32.351
Ah, how about you, Brad?
You wanna...

56:32.418 --> 56:33.986
No, Lanky.

56:35.421 --> 56:38.991
Come on, man. You used to
get high with my brother, right?

56:40.526 --> 56:45.831
That's uh, pretty cool, Lanky,
you know, to go back.

56:45.898 --> 56:47.266
I don't have to do anything.

56:47.333 --> 56:50.102
I said that before. I can do
whatever the fuck I want.

56:50.169 --> 56:52.905
Okay, okay.

56:52.972 --> 56:55.941
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

56:56.008 --> 56:58.477
My stupid brother
stringing himself up

56:58.544 --> 57:00.312
in the fucking bathroom.

57:03.048 --> 57:05.985
Seriously, man, you've got this
pain in the ass brother,

57:06.051 --> 57:08.020
always beating
the shit out of you

57:08.087 --> 57:09.788
and stealing your fucking dough,

57:09.855 --> 57:13.392
and think about it.

57:13.459 --> 57:17.997
Your brother hangs himself
with your fucking belt.

57:18.063 --> 57:21.267
And you have to find him
because your parents are out

57:21.333 --> 57:23.869
doing whatever the fuck it is
they do.

57:23.936 --> 57:27.006
Looking for spaceships
or some shit.

57:28.140 --> 57:30.910
It's excellent from that day on.

57:32.411 --> 57:37.149
It's like you go in there
and he's just there.

57:37.216 --> 57:40.252
You know,
like hanging in the shower.

57:40.319 --> 57:44.423
And you try to get him down,
but the fucker's so heavy.

57:44.490 --> 57:46.091
You can't move him.

57:47.226 --> 57:49.295
His feet are still
touching the ground.

57:49.361 --> 57:52.898
Like that's not what hanging is.
How can the fucker be dead

57:52.965 --> 57:55.234
if his feet are still
touching the ground?

57:56.101 --> 57:58.270
Seriously, man.

58:01.240 --> 58:03.342
I mean, his girlfriend
strings herself up

58:03.409 --> 58:05.844
and everyone said
my brother could too.

58:05.911 --> 58:08.781
And my parents,
they had to watch him.

58:08.847 --> 58:10.282
But they didn't.

58:10.349 --> 58:13.185
So now I do
whatever the fuck I want,

58:13.252 --> 58:15.487
when I want,
get whatever I want.

58:17.990 --> 58:20.192
My dad bought me a truck.

58:20.259 --> 58:25.064
I can't even drive that shit
for two fucking more years.

58:25.130 --> 58:28.200
No, Lanky, your
brother was cool.

58:28.267 --> 58:32.004
Dean, man, you like trucks
and shit, right?

58:32.071 --> 58:34.473
This truck is fucking mint.

58:34.540 --> 58:36.275
What kind of truck is it?

58:36.342 --> 58:42.448
SR5 '84 fucking loaded, man,
loaded.

58:42.514 --> 58:44.283
Oh, fuck it.

58:44.350 --> 58:46.185
What do you do with it
if you can't drive it?

58:46.252 --> 58:50.089
I go in there and I just
fire it up.

58:50.155 --> 58:53.826
Listen to some tunes, you know,
some fucking Maiden,

58:53.892 --> 58:57.496
some fucking Priest.
It's got five speakers.

58:57.563 --> 59:02.501
Sounds like you're in Hartford
fucking Civic Center, man.

59:04.203 --> 59:06.538
I sit in there and I think about
how I'm gonna be driving

59:06.605 --> 59:10.376
- that badass all over town...
- You hear me, Lanky?

59:10.442 --> 59:13.846
- You hear what I said?
- You don't even...

59:13.912 --> 59:16.248
No, man. You don't even know.

59:16.315 --> 59:18.384
Your brother was cool.

59:18.450 --> 59:21.887
He'd come over and he'd
hang out and he was cool.

59:21.954 --> 59:25.557
Come on, who wants to get high?

59:25.624 --> 59:27.393
Any of you faggots?

59:28.961 --> 59:31.530
Shel, man, Jew
want to, right Shel?

59:31.597 --> 59:32.831
Shut up, Lanky!

59:32.898 --> 59:36.068
Jew, why you're...
why aren't you getting mad?

59:36.135 --> 59:39.071
Fuck off, Lanky.
You're being a psycho.

59:39.138 --> 59:43.008
What about you, James?
You're like a freak now, right?

59:44.176 --> 59:46.412
Why don't you look at my face?

59:49.615 --> 59:51.583
Look at my face.

59:51.650 --> 59:52.618
Look at my face!

59:52.685 --> 59:54.520
Fucking stop, asshole!

59:54.586 --> 59:57.289
I'm just kidding around.

59:57.356 --> 1:00:00.392
What? None of you faggots
wanna get high?

1:00:00.459 --> 1:00:03.128
I'm letting you get high
for free and nobody wants to?

1:00:03.195 --> 1:00:07.099
I will. Yeah, I want to, Lanky.

1:00:08.100 --> 1:00:09.401
Ah, see...

1:00:11.003 --> 1:00:14.106
at least someone's
not a fucking faggot.

1:00:14.173 --> 1:00:16.442
Let's go to the construction
site. I'll take you there.

1:00:16.508 --> 1:00:18.043
Okay, come on, let's go.

1:00:18.110 --> 1:00:20.045
You fucking fags, man.

1:00:21.413 --> 1:00:23.916
He's such a psycho, holy fuck.

1:00:23.982 --> 1:00:25.651
- Kira, Lanky's brother.
- Lanky was an asshole

1:00:25.718 --> 1:00:26.885
before that happened.

1:00:26.952 --> 1:00:29.088
The only reason anyone
gives a shit about Lanky

1:00:29.154 --> 1:00:30.656
is because his brother
killed himself.

1:00:30.723 --> 1:00:32.291
We were friends with Lanky.

1:00:33.292 --> 1:00:35.127
We were all friends with Lanky.

1:00:49.541 --> 1:00:51.710
I mean, it's so stupid.

1:00:51.778 --> 1:00:54.246
I'm not even Jewish,
I'm only half.

1:00:55.447 --> 1:00:58.016
W-was your mother
or your father Jewish?

1:00:58.083 --> 1:01:00.419
What? My mom is.

1:01:00.486 --> 1:01:02.321
Well then, you're Jewish
automatically.

1:01:02.388 --> 1:01:05.157
What do you mean?
That makes no sense.

1:01:05.224 --> 1:01:06.525
You can't be a religion
just because of someone else.

1:01:06.592 --> 1:01:09.128
It's a fact. If your mom
is Jewish then you're Jewish.

1:01:09.194 --> 1:01:10.496
It's religion, it's not a thing.

1:01:10.562 --> 1:01:11.930
What does that mean?

1:01:11.997 --> 1:01:16.101
It means, a religion is a belief
and a belief is an action.

1:01:16.168 --> 1:01:18.270
You have to practice it
to be it. You can't just

1:01:18.337 --> 1:01:20.539
biologically inherit something
that you practice.

1:01:20.606 --> 1:01:21.907
I'm not Jewish, okay?

1:01:21.974 --> 1:01:25.077
- My dad's Catholic.
- Okay, my mother plays tennis.

1:01:25.144 --> 1:01:26.746
Doesn't make me
a tennis player, does it?

1:01:26.813 --> 1:01:28.447
So stupid.

1:01:28.514 --> 1:01:29.783
No, it's not.

1:01:29.849 --> 1:01:32.384
She plays tennis.
She doesn't believe in tennis.

1:01:32.451 --> 1:01:35.988
My mother believes
in Peach Schnapps.

1:01:36.054 --> 1:01:38.657
My mother believes
in Neil Diamond.

1:01:38.724 --> 1:01:42.094
My mother believes
in not being with my father.

1:01:42.161 --> 1:01:44.329
My mother believes
in Zimmermann.

1:01:44.396 --> 1:01:49.001
My father believes
in other kids' mothers.

1:01:49.067 --> 1:01:51.370
And the point is,
it's all the same thing.

1:01:51.437 --> 1:01:53.205
If you're parents are black
then you're black,

1:01:53.272 --> 1:01:56.408
that's genetics. You don't have
to practice being black.

1:01:56.475 --> 1:01:59.111
Shel, do you say the prayers
and do the Hanukkah stuff?

1:01:59.178 --> 1:02:01.246
Um, sort of. But I also
celebrate Christmas

1:02:01.313 --> 1:02:02.749
so it cancels out.

1:02:02.816 --> 1:02:06.084
But if you go to a temple one
day, you go to church the next,

1:02:06.151 --> 1:02:07.386
they cancel each other out.

1:02:07.453 --> 1:02:10.355
No, if you sorta celebrate
Hanukkah, you're Jewish.

1:02:10.422 --> 1:02:12.057
How can he be more
Jewish than Catholic

1:02:12.124 --> 1:02:13.459
if he still does
the Christmas stuff?

1:02:13.525 --> 1:02:15.427
Because being Jewish
is less common

1:02:15.494 --> 1:02:17.563
so if you're a little Jewish,
it counts more.

1:02:23.435 --> 1:02:27.105
All right, get in
a straight line everyone.

1:02:27.172 --> 1:02:29.809
Don't fuck around,
I'm not kidding here.

1:02:29.876 --> 1:02:31.109
They're letting everyone in.

1:02:31.176 --> 1:02:33.512
To come in, kid,
you gotta stay in line.

1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:37.951
Fucking hurry, okay?

1:02:55.634 --> 1:02:58.838
Let's go inside, man.
Everyone's going inside.

1:02:58.905 --> 1:03:00.439
I don't care.

1:03:00.506 --> 1:03:03.075
- What do you mean?
- I don't care.

1:03:03.141 --> 1:03:04.744
I don't want to.

1:03:04.811 --> 1:03:06.645
Okay, don't worry about that,

1:03:06.712 --> 1:03:08.313
about Amy. Look, she's okay.

1:03:08.380 --> 1:03:11.083
I don't want to.
I don't want to.

1:03:11.149 --> 1:03:12.251
Wait, you don't wanna
go in to Polo's?

1:03:12.317 --> 1:03:13.452
What are you talking about?

1:03:13.519 --> 1:03:15.654
I don't wanna do
those Mark chores tomorrow.

1:03:15.721 --> 1:03:18.223
I don't wanna do it
every other weekend.

1:03:18.290 --> 1:03:20.692
I miss soccer games
every time I go.

1:03:20.760 --> 1:03:22.094
I don't wanna be like that.

1:03:22.160 --> 1:03:24.831
Shel, it's okay. Just go inside.

1:03:24.898 --> 1:03:27.366
I got three out of five
on that quiz.

1:03:27.432 --> 1:03:29.368
I don't wanna do that.
I mean, I was all honors.

1:03:29.434 --> 1:03:31.470
- Now, I got three out of five.
- Shel!

1:03:31.537 --> 1:03:32.772
You're going in.

1:03:40.279 --> 1:03:41.580
- Shel!
- You told me about this.

1:03:41.647 --> 1:03:43.682
- Lanky, stop it. Get off him.
- What are you doing?

1:03:43.750 --> 1:03:45.417
Fuck off.

1:03:45.484 --> 1:03:48.320
No, no, stop! Lanky!

1:03:48.387 --> 1:03:50.255
- Fuck, no!
- You fucking asshole!

1:03:50.322 --> 1:03:52.859
- Fuck you, Lanky!
- Lanky, stop!

1:03:52.926 --> 1:03:54.761
- Give it back!
- No!

1:03:54.827 --> 1:03:56.395
- No.
- Don't.

1:03:56.461 --> 1:03:57.730
Don't.

1:03:57.797 --> 1:04:00.833
- Do you want me to stop?
- Come on, Lanky, cut it out.

1:04:08.206 --> 1:04:10.542
You want me to stop? Oh, sure.

1:04:10.609 --> 1:04:12.812
Here, I'll stop right now.

1:04:12.879 --> 1:04:14.313
No!

1:04:14.379 --> 1:04:16.248
You fucking asshole!

1:04:17.884 --> 1:04:19.551
Brad, stop!

1:04:20.519 --> 1:04:23.622
It's Lanky, Brad. It's Lanky.

1:04:45.778 --> 1:04:48.280
Oh, wow.

1:04:49.247 --> 1:04:51.383
Fuck.

1:05:03.595 --> 1:05:04.731
Wait.

1:05:06.531 --> 1:05:08.700
Kira, you're going inside?

1:05:08.768 --> 1:05:11.570
After all that? I thought
you said it was stupid and lame?

1:05:11.637 --> 1:05:13.438
Poptarts.

1:05:13.505 --> 1:05:16.776
That we were all poptarts
waiting to get inside.

1:05:16.843 --> 1:05:20.579
I don't know. I mean,
what else are we going to do?

1:05:21.848 --> 1:05:23.515
What are we gonna do, Missy?

1:05:24.751 --> 1:05:27.386
I mean, there's really
nothing else to do.

1:05:47.305 --> 1:05:48.540
Shel.

1:05:48.607 --> 1:05:49.876
- Shel!
- What happened?

1:05:49.942 --> 1:05:51.844
- Where did you go with Lanky?
- Look, it's okay.

1:05:51.911 --> 1:05:55.247
I just talked to him. I just...

1:05:55.313 --> 1:05:56.816
- tried to...
- Where did you go with him?

1:05:56.883 --> 1:05:59.584
I just tried to make him calm,
that's all.

1:06:00.585 --> 1:06:02.721
What are you talking about?

1:06:02.789 --> 1:06:05.424
We talked about
his brother's funeral.

1:06:05.490 --> 1:06:07.359
They played a song called,

1:06:07.426 --> 1:06:09.361
"Wildland" or "Wild World"
it was,

1:06:09.428 --> 1:06:13.365
and, his girlfriend wrote a note

1:06:13.432 --> 1:06:15.835
that she wanted the song
to be played over and over.

1:06:15.902 --> 1:06:20.807
And, his brother,
he wanted the same thing.

1:06:20.873 --> 1:06:24.944
"Wild World". That was
definitely a "Wild World".

1:06:25.011 --> 1:06:26.411
Amy, you shouldn't have gone.

1:06:26.478 --> 1:06:29.414
And then we smoked
some of his pot.

1:06:29.481 --> 1:06:33.285
And, he saw the thing
where you put the gun

1:06:33.351 --> 1:06:38.356
and he-he asked and I told him
'cause we were just talking.

1:06:38.423 --> 1:06:40.492
And it was sort of okay
until then, and I...

1:06:40.559 --> 1:06:42.829
I don't know. I shouldn't have
told him about the gun.

1:06:42.895 --> 1:06:44.429
The gun.

1:06:44.496 --> 1:06:46.833
- Stupid gun.
- I'm really okay.

1:06:46.899 --> 1:06:49.434
Shelby, I... I don't know.

1:06:49.501 --> 1:06:52.571
I probably shouldn't have gone,
but I did.

1:06:52.637 --> 1:06:55.240
Sometimes, we just do things,
and...

1:07:02.148 --> 1:07:04.050
I'm glad you did that.

1:07:04.117 --> 1:07:06.651
I wanted to. I really wanted to.

1:07:06.718 --> 1:07:08.921
Me too... i-it felt important.

1:07:15.494 --> 1:07:18.330
Do you wanna go inside?
Everyone went inside.

1:07:18.396 --> 1:07:20.332
I want to, okay? I really do.

1:07:20.398 --> 1:07:22.667
Me too.

1:07:23.635 --> 1:07:26.638
I wanna do everything.

1:07:26.705 --> 1:07:29.407
Okay, I wanna do drama
and be in <i>Our Town,</i>

1:07:29.474 --> 1:07:31.844
and I wanna do soc...
I wanna do everything.

1:07:34.781 --> 1:07:36.481
I don't wanna get three
out of five anymore.

1:07:36.548 --> 1:07:38.084
I'm not gonna do that.

1:07:38.151 --> 1:07:40.352
I don't care what time
I get home tomorrow morning.

1:07:40.418 --> 1:07:42.021
I don't care what Mark says.

1:07:42.088 --> 1:07:43.756
I'm really gonna do everything.

1:07:43.823 --> 1:07:45.524
You should do it.

1:07:46.558 --> 1:07:49.762
Do you wanna go inside?
Everyone else did.

1:07:49.829 --> 1:07:53.632
No... well, I mean, yeah, but,
I wanna find Brad.

1:07:53.698 --> 1:07:56.368
I mean, I'm sure he's okay.
He's Brad, you know.

1:07:58.503 --> 1:08:00.039
I'll see you inside.

1:08:19.826 --> 1:08:21.093
Oh, shit.

1:08:48.754 --> 1:08:49.989
Brad?

1:08:52.925 --> 1:08:54.693
Go away.

1:08:54.760 --> 1:08:56.062
What are you doing?

1:08:57.163 --> 1:08:59.065
Go fucking away.

1:09:00.867 --> 1:09:02.902
There are pellets in there.

1:09:04.636 --> 1:09:05.805
If you want me to beat
the shit out of you,

1:09:05.872 --> 1:09:08.707
I'll beat the shit out of you.
I swear to God.

1:09:14.046 --> 1:09:15.848
Leave.

1:09:19.684 --> 1:09:22.989
I said fucking leave.
I'm not kidding.

1:09:32.530 --> 1:09:33.866
Leave.

1:11:05.191 --> 1:11:06.725
Brad.

1:11:11.764 --> 1:11:13.498
Man, I saw it.

1:11:26.312 --> 1:11:28.114
I liked Lanky's brother.

1:11:30.016 --> 1:11:31.250
I liked him.

1:11:33.085 --> 1:11:37.023
He used to come over
and hang out with my sister.

1:11:39.792 --> 1:11:41.193
He was so cool.

1:11:42.928 --> 1:11:44.797
She knew his girlfriend too.

1:11:46.065 --> 1:11:51.003
He used to come into my room
and talk to me about stuff.

1:11:53.939 --> 1:11:58.978
Talk to me about high schoolers,
and some of the crazy stuff.

1:12:01.247 --> 1:12:05.518
He talked to me about girls,
the stuff he did with them.

1:12:06.819 --> 1:12:08.287
Boy, he was cool.

1:12:10.756 --> 1:12:13.059
So one time, he...

1:12:13.125 --> 1:12:16.228
he came to my room and I was...
I was reading something.

1:12:17.963 --> 1:12:22.101
It's a book. I forget... but...

1:12:23.969 --> 1:12:27.239
He had read it too, uh...
a long time ago.

1:12:30.708 --> 1:12:33.179
<i>Watership Down.</i>

1:12:33.245 --> 1:12:38.250
He just started telling me
all these stuff about this book.

1:12:39.852 --> 1:12:40.986
Stuff you would only know
if somebody told you,

1:12:41.053 --> 1:12:43.989
because it-it...
it wasn't in the book, it was...

1:12:46.225 --> 1:12:48.027
it was like deeper
than the book.

1:12:50.029 --> 1:12:53.432
He was full of that kind
of stuff.

1:12:53.499 --> 1:12:56.268
Deeper stuff.

1:12:56.335 --> 1:12:58.204
Everything was cool.

1:13:01.173 --> 1:13:04.977
He gave me this record,
Frank Zappa,

1:13:07.413 --> 1:13:12.151
and a bunch of funny songs on
there about eating yellow snow.

1:13:14.820 --> 1:13:18.290
We'd memorize the lyrics
and we'd laugh.

1:13:20.426 --> 1:13:22.027
He was cool.

1:13:24.263 --> 1:13:25.965
So cool.

1:13:28.801 --> 1:13:30.635
Lanky's brother was cool.

1:13:40.513 --> 1:13:43.715
I saw it, Brad.
Okay, I saw it, man.

1:13:43.782 --> 1:13:45.818
I saw it.

1:13:45.885 --> 1:13:47.820
- What?
- The thing. It's real.

1:13:47.887 --> 1:13:49.088
It's really real.

1:13:49.155 --> 1:13:52.224
W-what? What the fuck
are you talking about?

1:13:52.291 --> 1:13:56.362
Y-you can see it, the UFO.
I swear to God, I just saw it.

1:13:56.428 --> 1:13:59.899
There's no UFO, man. You sound
like Pete and those assholes.

1:13:59.965 --> 1:14:01.867
Okay, it's real.
And it's not planes

1:14:01.934 --> 1:14:03.135
because it was solid
under the moon

1:14:03.202 --> 1:14:04.737
and it didn't make any noise.

1:14:04.803 --> 1:14:07.306
Bullshit. There's nothing
out there, man.

1:14:07.373 --> 1:14:09.275
Just come on, you'll see.

1:14:09.341 --> 1:14:11.243
You mean the fucking UFO?

1:14:25.491 --> 1:14:27.826
Dude, there's no UFO.

1:14:27.893 --> 1:14:28.961
There is, come on!

1:14:29.028 --> 1:14:32.231
It's awesome.
It's totally awesome.
