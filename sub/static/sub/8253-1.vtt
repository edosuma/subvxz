00:44.223 --> 00:46.454
Are you gonna...
You bringing Micky in?

00:46.465 --> 00:47.393
Yeah, he's here.

00:47.416 --> 00:49.471
He should come.
He should be here as well.

00:49.495 --> 00:51.620
We thought that Micky is
coming to answer the questions.

00:51.643 --> 00:53.842
No, they said it was
going to be both of us.

00:54.883 --> 00:58.734
- Am I looking right into the camera here?
- Just look at me right now.

00:58.746 --> 01:00.239
All right.

01:00.262 --> 01:03.418
You're not going to look
at the camera with the interviews?

01:06.279 --> 01:09.267
I started boxing when I was
twelve years old

01:09.291 --> 01:11.885
and I lied and said I was eighteen
or whatever it was.

01:11.896 --> 01:13.810
I had a different name and everything.

01:13.822 --> 01:16.073
I mean, I don't have any fights,
I've done a hundred more than that

01:16.096 --> 01:18.636
before I turned professional.

01:19.233 --> 01:20.490
This morning you said that...

01:20.501 --> 01:22.169
- Why are we doing this?
- One more time.

01:22.193 --> 01:24.142
You want to go over it all?
You want to start again?

01:24.153 --> 01:27.617
He's my younger brother.
I taught him everything he knows.

01:27.633 --> 01:29.840
I'm still his trainer.
I know we've got different styles,

01:29.863 --> 01:33.997
I'm fucking squirelly as fuck.
You know, like, I'm not even there.

01:34.003 --> 01:38.625
That's what Sugar Ray said. I was the
most tricky fighter he'd ever come across.

01:39.426 --> 01:44.040
'78, before Sugar Ray Leonard...
I told him he couldn't get to me.

01:44.064 --> 01:45.766
He couldn't get to me.

01:45.785 --> 01:48.709
They called me "The Pride of Lowell."

01:48.726 --> 01:51.509
Everybody still talks about it,
you know, especially my brother.

01:51.523 --> 01:53.907
His whole life he wanted to do
what I did, you know?

01:53.930 --> 01:56.255
But we're very different fighters.

01:56.261 --> 02:02.026
Micky's a heavy hitter.
He's thunderous, I'm telling you.

02:02.049 --> 02:03.856
Thunderous left punch.

02:03.879 --> 02:07.366
Micky, he takes a punishment.
I don't know why he does it.

02:07.381 --> 02:09.565
I'd say "You all right?"
He likes getting on the inside.

02:09.577 --> 02:11.092
I stay on the outside.

02:40.584 --> 02:41.619
Come on!

02:43.367 --> 02:44.353
Dicky...

02:49.473 --> 02:51.228
Would you come on?

02:52.169 --> 02:54.129
Stop.
You've got to help me finish this.

02:57.503 --> 02:58.619
Come on!

02:58.622 --> 03:00.829
Unpredictable as ever!

03:00.853 --> 03:03.808
You don't have to be Columbo
to see where this fight is headed!

03:04.399 --> 03:06.360
Yeah, bam!

03:06.371 --> 03:09.247
All right, he punched Micky Ward down!

03:09.272 --> 03:13.417
HBO's making a movie on me and
my comeback and my brother

03:13.440 --> 03:18.078
is going to beat Saoul Mamby
in Atlanta next week!

03:18.098 --> 03:21.931
The Pride of Lowell is back!

03:21.938 --> 03:24.132
Quacker!

03:24.150 --> 03:26.734
Who wants some?
Who wants some?

03:26.854 --> 03:32.070
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
www.addic7ed.com

03:49.465 --> 03:51.021
I want a cut.

03:53.849 --> 03:55.194
Doing good?

03:55.219 --> 03:57.261
You guys having a good day?

03:57.673 --> 03:59.065
How are you?

03:59.923 --> 04:04.819
Come on. Come on. What you got?
What you got going on?

04:05.338 --> 04:07.941
Lou! Hey, Lou DiBella!

04:07.945 --> 04:10.775
How are you guys, huh?

04:14.870 --> 04:16.882
I'm making my comeback.

04:17.731 --> 04:20.120
Hey, Marty, Marty.
Come out here, huh?

04:36.487 --> 04:38.002
Hey!

04:38.008 --> 04:41.237
HBO is making a movie on me!

04:41.736 --> 04:42.945
Hey, beautiful.

04:49.443 --> 04:51.054
You got that?

04:51.062 --> 04:54.557
Can't remember who she is.
I can't remember shit!

04:54.577 --> 04:57.195
Hey!
Hey, Garcia!

04:58.240 --> 05:00.089
How are you, nice?

05:00.788 --> 05:03.168
How'd you get here?
Drive around?

05:03.184 --> 05:06.264
Hey, Ray. Hey.
I love you, Ray.

05:06.869 --> 05:08.504
This is what it's all about.

05:34.076 --> 05:35.156
He make mistake?

05:35.160 --> 05:37.359
No, he'll be here.
Like I said,

05:37.369 --> 05:39.989
sometimes he goes on his own schedule,
but when he gets here we work hard.

05:40.001 --> 05:41.927
Nobody pushes me harder than him.

05:41.938 --> 05:44.634
He's supposed to be
training you right now, right?

05:44.648 --> 05:46.466
Why don't you just go talk to them,
my sisters?

05:46.478 --> 05:48.685
They'll talk your ear off.
You gotta pay them to shut up.

05:48.697 --> 05:51.183
He can tell you how
Dicky was helping him.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.867
Come on, Micky.

05:53.987 --> 05:54.845
Okay.

05:56.597 --> 05:58.150
Hey, we don't know where Dicky is.

05:58.161 --> 05:59.982
You know where he is.

06:16.821 --> 06:19.135
What's that dumb cop doing in there?

06:19.146 --> 06:20.943
Where's Dicky?
Girls?

06:20.959 --> 06:22.732
- I don't know.
- You see him this morning?

06:22.743 --> 06:24.798
Your brother?
Not this morning.

06:24.817 --> 06:27.047
Look at Mom!
All dressed up for the movie, huh?

06:28.083 --> 06:29.712
You are smoking hot!

06:29.832 --> 06:32.843
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.
My Dicky should be doing that.

06:32.866 --> 06:34.759
Dicky ain't here, Alice.

06:35.583 --> 06:38.894
Micky's got an important fight
coming up and he's not training.

06:38.906 --> 06:40.714
- Forget about him. Never mind about him.
- He's not doing what he's supposed to do with him.

06:40.731 --> 06:43.608
- Start saying to Micky...
- He's not part of this, all right?

06:43.619 --> 06:46.015
- Alice, he's not being handled right.
- Did you get me coming in all right?

06:46.026 --> 06:48.340
You want me to do it again?
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.

06:48.357 --> 06:50.717
- Dicky's the trainer.
- I'm doing him favor, Alice.

06:50.723 --> 06:52.821
I will show you over here

06:52.844 --> 06:56.179
these scrapbooks I have been
collecting for years.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.001
Micky used to follow
his big brother everywhere.

06:59.013 --> 07:01.080
Taught you everything, didn't he, honey?

07:01.092 --> 07:05.479
In '78 we got the offer
to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.

07:05.498 --> 07:08.164
Oh, my God. Have you seen that video?
Well, you're from HBO,

07:08.175 --> 07:11.427
you've got to see it again!
Come on. Where's the video at?

07:17.403 --> 07:21.352
Tonight my son is going to surprise
everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard.

07:21.364 --> 07:23.397
Believe me. I know it.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.521
Sugar Ray might have some trouble tonight.

07:27.533 --> 07:31.054
That's a good possibility.
He comes in here against a good boxer,

07:31.065 --> 07:33.050
a young man who can punch,

07:33.073 --> 07:36.980
and I would like to say at this time
that physically they're just about equal.

07:55.141 --> 07:58.976
Leonard is down.
Let's see if that's a knockout.

07:59.841 --> 08:02.841
This is unbelievable.

08:03.889 --> 08:09.284
Eklund just walked over there.
Nobody seems to know what's happening.

08:15.427 --> 08:16.758
Dicky did it.

08:17.463 --> 08:18.395
Dicky did it.

08:20.584 --> 08:21.617
Dicky did it!

08:21.629 --> 08:23.871
Aren't you supposed to be
training Micky right now?

08:23.890 --> 08:25.416
No, it ain't until 9:00.

08:25.426 --> 08:27.904
Dicky, it's fucking 11:45.

08:27.927 --> 08:30.866
- It's 11:45, Dick.
- What?

08:30.876 --> 08:33.096
Where'd you fucking
park the car, Boo Boo?

08:33.113 --> 08:35.251
- I didn't park it. You did.
- Huh?

08:35.275 --> 08:37.972
Check your fucking pockets for the keys.
You've got the keys, huh?

08:37.985 --> 08:39.715
I didn't park it, man.

08:39.719 --> 08:42.149
- Not here. I don't know...
- Check your pockets, all right?

08:42.171 --> 08:46.480
Oh, fuck it, I'll run.
I need the fucking road work.

08:46.504 --> 08:49.639
Road work?
Are you crazy?

08:49.662 --> 08:51.192
He's a great runner.

09:16.818 --> 09:17.910
Hey.

09:19.043 --> 09:20.112
Hey!

09:22.014 --> 09:24.175
- I'm here!
- Hey, Dicky.

09:24.196 --> 09:26.164
Better late than never.

09:27.211 --> 09:28.303
Here, look.

09:28.315 --> 09:30.200
Detectives on the scene...

09:33.021 --> 09:35.501
Get to the bar with this...

09:35.870 --> 09:38.465
- Figure this one out, huh?
- Why don't you...

09:39.645 --> 09:41.488
Hold it. Hold it.
Let me get this straight.

09:41.512 --> 09:44.749
You guys are working in the same corner
as Micky, together, right?

09:44.772 --> 09:47.217
Yeah.
Yeah, they're both in my corner.

09:47.239 --> 09:49.223
- This is what goes on.
- Okay. It must be...

09:49.246 --> 09:51.335
Don't you have a job to
go to or something?

09:51.346 --> 09:54.047
Really, O'Keefe has a job
that he should be at.

09:54.070 --> 09:56.661
Yeah, Sergeant O'Keefe's
working overtime here.

09:56.669 --> 10:01.155
So we go at this old man:
Jewish, black, former world champion.

10:01.166 --> 10:02.951
I think we've got
all the bases covered.

10:02.974 --> 10:07.342
And my kid brother,
he's lost three fights in a row.

10:07.354 --> 10:09.397
He can't get used to losing.
It's a mental thing.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.945
But we're gonna break that
with Mamby, right?

10:11.958 --> 10:13.543
Yeah, I hope.
When we can train.

10:13.567 --> 10:16.209
When we train. Right.
Don't be wasting time, Mick, you know?

10:16.225 --> 10:17.881
- Wasting time?
- Half the fucking day's gone.

10:17.904 --> 10:21.514
Yeah, half the day's gone.
I've been waiting for you.

10:52.018 --> 10:55.750
Come on, move.
We're going to outbox Mamby, huh?

10:57.412 --> 11:01.005
- Take it out on the head.
- Head, body, head. That's your combo.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.613
Head, body, head, body.
My Dicky taught him that.

11:03.636 --> 11:06.053
You know,
Sugar Ray's going to be there

11:06.070 --> 11:08.361
calling the fight for ESPN.

11:09.087 --> 11:12.269
I ain't seen him since
I knocked him down,

11:12.287 --> 11:15.329
like, fourteen years ago
or something, right?

11:16.964 --> 11:19.183
Let's get a real sparring going on here.

11:19.206 --> 11:21.144
Don't want to embarrass yourself.

11:21.150 --> 11:23.874
Don't want to embarrass yourself
in front of Sugar Ray, huh?

11:24.427 --> 11:26.149
Come on, head, body, head.

11:29.068 --> 11:30.641
Your punch, man!

11:31.028 --> 11:35.455
That's your punch. Now that's your little punch.
Use your whole fucking body now.

11:35.473 --> 11:39.621
George's fingers are so fucking big
he can't even dial the phone!

11:42.410 --> 11:44.512
That's not helping, George!

11:45.766 --> 11:47.281
- Wait, I'm confused.
- What?

11:47.304 --> 11:49.218
- I'm confused, too.
- We're confused.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.579
- George is whose father?
- You're confused?

11:51.602 --> 11:56.907
Dick Eklund Sr. is Dicky's,
Donna's, Gail's and Phyllis' father.

11:56.914 --> 11:58.616
- Dick Eklund.
- Yeah.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.974
And even though Alice is an Eklund,
so are Cindy and Cathy.

12:01.998 --> 12:03.970
George is really...

12:03.992 --> 12:06.152
- And Micky...
- No.

12:06.174 --> 12:08.005
Micky and I are Wards.

12:08.851 --> 12:12.981
It's always sounded like Dick Eklund
and I were separated, right?

12:13.004 --> 12:15.329
- And then there was George.
- Just George.

12:15.341 --> 12:17.783
- George is my man.
- George is our papa.

12:17.806 --> 12:20.497
After Dick, it was just George.

12:31.012 --> 12:32.709
Come on.
Come over here...

12:50.943 --> 12:54.377
Why don't you just go talk to her?
She's a nice girl.

12:54.389 --> 12:56.135
I told her all about you.

12:57.070 --> 12:59.740
I don't want to ask her.
She's going to say no.

13:01.112 --> 13:03.175
Can't beat that ass, can you?

13:03.813 --> 13:06.078
Get at it. Go.
Come on.

13:14.486 --> 13:16.929
Are you just going to stand there
and stare at my ass?

13:16.940 --> 13:19.959
Your father stares at my ass
but he talks to me.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.598
He thinks you're the greatest.

13:23.209 --> 13:25.369
- He didn't tell me you were new.
- Keep the change, doll.

13:25.393 --> 13:27.071
He told me you came for you sister.

13:27.081 --> 13:28.866
- This is a tip?
- Yeah, that's my tip!

13:28.888 --> 13:30.799
You know what the bell says
about this one?

13:30.818 --> 13:33.507
Cheap bastard.
Cheap fucker.

13:33.530 --> 13:36.280
Comes in every day,
gives me shitty tips.

13:36.303 --> 13:37.979
Yeah, fuck you, too.

13:39.609 --> 13:41.605
You pave streets, right?

13:41.628 --> 13:43.425
Yeah, I do. And I'm a fighter.

13:43.449 --> 13:45.503
Oh, yeah. I heard you're a stepping stone.

13:45.527 --> 13:47.922
- I'm no stepping stone.
- Mm.

13:47.938 --> 13:50.110
You're the guy they use

13:51.226 --> 13:53.410
against the other fighters
to move the other fighters up.

13:53.425 --> 13:55.656
I've had a few tough fights,
but that's not who I am.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.090
The next fight's going to show who I am.

13:58.114 --> 14:00.348
Yeah, and he's going to
lose that one, too.

14:00.371 --> 14:03.178
Scotch and soda, Charlene.
And one for yourself.

14:03.189 --> 14:05.679
Now move that sugar ass...

14:07.537 --> 14:09.956
Okay, be respectful.
Don't disrespect her.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.850
Hey, don't hurt your hand.
You've got a fight next week.

14:12.862 --> 14:14.787
Besides,
you wipe your ass with that one.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.607
Don't wait up, or I'm going to hit
you in the car, sucker, all right?

14:17.619 --> 14:19.932
He's gonna be so lame.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.996
All right?
All right?

14:24.503 --> 14:25.525
That's right.

14:26.230 --> 14:28.484
Take your drink.
He's taking his drink.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.867
This guy's going to be champion.
He's a great guy. He's a great fighter.

14:31.886 --> 14:34.426
Okay? Hold on.
Thanks for the drink.

14:34.449 --> 14:36.774
You know those cameras
are making a movie about him?

14:36.789 --> 14:38.633
He knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard

14:38.656 --> 14:40.993
on HBO. That's why they're following
him around with the cameras.

14:41.018 --> 14:42.919
They're making a movie
about his comeback.

14:42.931 --> 14:45.902
Yeah, everybody's talking about it.
But who are you fighting?

14:45.925 --> 14:48.520
- Saoul Mamby.
- Saoul Mamby?

14:48.537 --> 14:50.906
- What kind of name is that?
- Black and Jewish.

14:51.998 --> 14:53.712
Where did they find a guy like that?

14:53.726 --> 14:55.874
He's no joke.
Former world champion.

14:55.898 --> 14:57.751
- Former champ?
- Yeah.

14:58.246 --> 15:00.283
- I match up good with him, though.
- Yeah?

15:00.295 --> 15:02.358
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?

15:02.375 --> 15:04.430
Well, I got a light end, you know?

15:04.449 --> 15:06.590
I've got a reputation for brawling,
but I'm not going to brawl with him.

15:06.602 --> 15:09.303
- I'm going to try to box him.
- There's a difference?

15:09.311 --> 15:12.296
Yeah, in brawling you slug it out.
I hit you. You hit me.

15:12.307 --> 15:13.963
Boxing is a chess game, you know?

15:13.985 --> 15:15.840
Got to pick my punches
to take him down.

15:15.852 --> 15:17.909
I'm going head, body, head, body...

15:19.063 --> 15:20.994
What is head, body, head, body?

15:21.018 --> 15:24.869
Well, I hit him in the head, then his
hands got to go up to protect himself.

15:24.887 --> 15:29.394
Opens up his body, then I hit him in the body,
hand goes back down. I go back up to the head,

15:29.418 --> 15:31.496
hand goes back, and I hit him in the body.

15:31.508 --> 15:34.420
People who don't know fighting think
you do a lot of damage hitting the head,

15:34.431 --> 15:36.839
but you actually do more hitting the body.

15:37.994 --> 15:39.799
So what do you think?
Can I take you out?

15:43.108 --> 15:44.768
Are you married?

15:45.280 --> 15:47.702
No, would I ask you out if I was married?
What kind of guy do you think I am?

15:47.722 --> 15:49.312
Happens all the time, trust me.

15:49.324 --> 15:50.705
I'm not like that.

15:51.944 --> 15:54.116
I'm not married. I've got a daughter,
I see her every other weekend.

15:54.128 --> 15:55.924
Her name is Kasie.
But that's it.

15:56.878 --> 15:58.622
Come on, let me take you out.

16:00.728 --> 16:02.050
When?

16:02.548 --> 16:04.393
Saturday night I'll be
back in Atlantic City.

16:21.738 --> 16:23.211
Is this the real number?

16:23.234 --> 16:25.080
You'll have to call it and see.

16:25.101 --> 16:26.414
I will.

16:26.426 --> 16:28.293
Saturday. Dinner and a movie.

16:51.170 --> 16:53.002
- Hey. What's up?
- Dicky, hey. How's it going?

16:53.025 --> 16:55.071
I don't think Laurie's
expecting you right now.

16:55.094 --> 16:58.606
What's he doing here?
This isn't your visitation day, Micky.

16:59.468 --> 17:01.629
I just want to say hi to Kasie.

17:01.644 --> 17:03.311
It's not your day, goodbye.

17:03.324 --> 17:05.260
Yeah, but I'm not around next week.

17:05.271 --> 17:06.998
Now you're ditching
the days you do have?

17:07.021 --> 17:08.829
No, I have a fight.
I told you that.

17:11.951 --> 17:14.416
- Jimmy...
- I can't get in the middle.

17:14.436 --> 17:17.630
I can't talk to her, okay?
So I'm asking you, Jimmy.

17:17.651 --> 17:20.050
I want to talk to my daughter now.

17:20.074 --> 17:22.528
- Talk to your father.
- God damn it, Jimmy.

17:22.550 --> 17:24.640
Hi, Daddy.
Daddy's gonna beat Saoul Mamby.

17:24.663 --> 17:28.597
That's right. And I'm gonna tell you that
after I win, I'm gonna start making big money.

17:28.609 --> 17:30.875
And I'll move into a bigger apartment,
like we talked about,

17:30.899 --> 17:33.259
- so you can live with me more days, okay?
- Yeah, a bigger apartment!

17:33.282 --> 17:35.760
- Wish me luck, all right?
- Don't hold your breath, Kasie.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.043
It's cruel to mislead your child, Micky.

17:38.056 --> 17:41.507
- Good luck, Daddy.
- Thanks, Kasie. I love you, honey.

17:41.519 --> 17:42.787
Bye, baby.

17:44.744 --> 17:48.693
- Where is he?
- Jesus Christ. Fucking holding us up.

17:56.370 --> 17:59.863
- Quit your worrying, for crying out loud.
- All that shit in my face...

17:59.875 --> 18:03.445
I know it's none of my business.
I go to a lot of meetings,

18:03.468 --> 18:06.561
and they have a saying:
"Let go and let God."

18:06.585 --> 18:08.965
- You've got to let him go, Mick.
- He's taught me everything I know.

18:08.977 --> 18:11.830
He's been in my corner.
I can't do it without him.

18:11.846 --> 18:15.014
- You're already doing it without him.
- No I'm not.

18:15.038 --> 18:16.783
- Yes you are.
- Look, you know where he is.

18:16.795 --> 18:19.196
Why don't you just go get him?

18:19.219 --> 18:20.652
Can you get him?

18:20.663 --> 18:22.307
I'm not fucking going to get him.

18:22.331 --> 18:25.461
Well are we all going to go over there
in the limo with Alice? We can't do that.

18:34.875 --> 18:36.108
Dicky.

18:38.012 --> 18:41.490
- Your mother's outside.
- What?

18:41.505 --> 18:45.116
Uh-oh, Dicky, your mother's outside.
She's down there.

18:49.393 --> 18:50.927
I'm not here.

18:56.646 --> 18:58.889
Don't, Dicky.
Dicky!

19:03.715 --> 19:06.169
What the fuck are you doing?
You know we've got to go to the airport now.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.879
We've got a flight to catch.

19:07.887 --> 19:10.102
You know how important this fight is to me.

19:11.064 --> 19:13.753
- Don't tell Mom I'm here, all right?
- She knows.

19:13.774 --> 19:16.521
- Pick me up back at the house, all right?
- Are you fucking...

19:16.544 --> 19:18.082
She's in the driveway right now.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.096
All right, but hurry up.
She's in the fucking driveway.

19:20.119 --> 19:24.527
- We've got a flight to catch.
- You do this on the day your brother's traveling?

19:26.351 --> 19:28.347
- What are you doing?
- Just trying to see what I have.

19:28.359 --> 19:30.491
- The fuck did you hit him for?
- Why'd you make me do that to you?

19:30.514 --> 19:31.653
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God, Dicky...

19:31.677 --> 19:33.438
I was on my way, Mom.

19:33.453 --> 19:35.355
- What are you doing?
- No, Mom. Mom...

19:36.846 --> 19:40.006
Why can't we just go to the
fucking airport for once, please?

19:40.898 --> 19:43.576
Hey, Alice, what about your husband who's
laying on the fucking ground over here?

19:43.599 --> 19:45.149
You want to help your husband?

19:45.159 --> 19:47.989
What are you doing, running in here
like a silverback fucking gorilla?

19:48.000 --> 19:51.617
- We had to get him, didn't we?
- Oh, yeah, you got him, pal.

20:10.117 --> 20:11.808
You see Mamby?

20:11.831 --> 20:15.330
See how Mamby's arm comes up?
Leaves his side open,

20:15.347 --> 20:17.659
you just play him up like a pinball machine.

20:17.670 --> 20:20.946
He'll be pissing blood.
No way you'll lose, Mick. No way.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.291
- Hey, Lou.
- Dicky, boy.

20:22.303 --> 20:24.146
Hey listen, boy.

20:24.170 --> 20:25.919
ESPN can't get us better rooms than this?

20:25.927 --> 20:28.651
I wouldn't worry about the rooms right now,
Dicky. You've got bigger headaches.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.155
Like what?

20:30.167 --> 20:32.832
The doctor won't let Mamby fight.

20:32.855 --> 20:34.117
Why not?

20:34.140 --> 20:36.477
- He's got the flu.
- Mamby got the flu?

20:36.500 --> 20:37.412
Yeah.

20:37.436 --> 20:38.985
Dicky, we can still have a fight.

20:38.997 --> 20:41.890
- With who?
- Mike Mungin.

20:41.913 --> 20:43.381
Mike Mungin, who's that?

20:43.403 --> 20:46.842
- Guy from Philly. Been in prison.
- He's been out a few months.

20:46.855 --> 20:50.530
I've called everybody, checked everywhere.
He's the only guy I could find.

20:50.554 --> 20:53.372
My last three fights were rough, Lou.
I mean this one's supposed to be easier.

20:53.396 --> 20:55.364
We've been fucking preparing for Mamby.

20:55.375 --> 20:58.804
Right, but this guy just came off the couch.
He's been sitting on his ass.

20:58.816 --> 21:01.516
Could be an easy win for Mick.

21:01.529 --> 21:04.410
Joey Farrell, remember him?
He knocked his ass out.

21:04.433 --> 21:08.235
- And you knocked down Joey Farrell...
- Exactly, and Mungin just got off the couch.

21:08.259 --> 21:10.185
Can't make weight.
Might be a bit over, though.

21:10.207 --> 21:11.357
How over?

21:11.368 --> 21:14.728
- 162, 165...
- 165?

21:15.444 --> 21:17.792
Micky dropped weight.
He's 146.

21:17.803 --> 21:21.437
Lou, we prepared for Mamby, all right?
We prepared for Mamby!

21:21.454 --> 21:24.589
This guy just got off the couch.
Micky's in shape.

21:24.606 --> 21:27.882
Road work, everything else.
This other guy hasn't done dick.

21:27.889 --> 21:31.118
Don't forget.
You don't fight, nobody gets paid.

21:39.133 --> 21:42.280
Lou, please...

21:43.310 --> 21:46.421
All right. Um,
Joey Farrell knocked him out...

21:46.433 --> 21:48.194
Going to be a hell of a fight, huh?

21:48.205 --> 21:50.478
I'm not doing this.
165 is big.

21:50.490 --> 21:53.438
- You knocked down Joey Farrell.
- So what? He's a middleweight.

21:53.459 --> 21:55.283
He just got off the couch.

21:55.306 --> 21:57.713
He's got twenty pounds on me, Dicky.

21:57.737 --> 22:00.636
Joey Farrell knocked him out.
You knocked down Joey Farrell.

22:00.660 --> 22:03.791
- You just said that.
- Yeah but... You can't be scared.

22:03.803 --> 22:04.789
- Scared?
- Yeah.

22:04.812 --> 22:06.761
- Why don't you go fucking fight him?
- I'll go fucking fight him. He's fat.

22:06.773 --> 22:10.378
Go snap out the teeth. It's your big comeback,
right? That's what Alice wants.

22:10.395 --> 22:13.072
You knocked down Joey Farrell.

22:13.081 --> 22:16.357
All right, I knocked down Joey Farrell, okay?
But the guy is a middleweight.

22:16.380 --> 22:19.429
I'm a welterweight. What, they don't have
a fucking heavyweight to tow in there with me?

22:19.440 --> 22:22.106
Tell him, Dicky. He can do it, right?
He can do anything.

22:22.129 --> 22:24.667
Yeah, Alice. No problem.

22:24.688 --> 22:27.281
You watch from the outside now.

22:27.293 --> 22:32.530
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mike "Machine Gun" Mungin!

22:34.226 --> 22:35.884
Holy shit!

22:36.465 --> 22:38.996
Hey, look.
There's Sugar Ray Leonard.

22:39.020 --> 22:42.753
Hey, Ray. Sugar Ray.
Over here.

22:42.777 --> 22:45.752
Dicky, come on.
Look at the size of that guy.

22:46.828 --> 22:48.977
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, holy shit.

22:48.989 --> 22:51.629
That guy's no welterweight.

22:51.654 --> 22:54.484
All right, Mick. Gonna have to learn
to fuss you around. It's time now.

22:54.498 --> 22:58.001
He did not just get off the fucking couch.
If he did, I want to buy a couch like that.

22:58.013 --> 23:01.253
I don't care who that guy is.
I don't care. Look at me.

23:01.265 --> 23:04.862
You're Micky Ward.
You're Micky Ward.

23:08.202 --> 23:11.234
Micky Ward fighting a last-minute
replacement from Philadelphia,

23:11.246 --> 23:13.946
a much bigger man.

23:13.955 --> 23:17.430
Punches smashing Ward.

23:18.910 --> 23:22.702
Ward goes down!
Ward goes down!

23:27.920 --> 23:31.239
Micky, what the fuck is wrong?
Get rid of this dude!

23:33.509 --> 23:36.741
Mungin didn't even know
he'd be fighting today...

23:40.885 --> 23:42.677
Come on, now, Mick!

23:44.850 --> 23:48.883
Ward, a respected fighter. You hope
this mismatch doesn't hurt his confidence.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.231
- You're a loser!
- Loser!

23:51.232 --> 23:53.122
You're a loser!

24:23.004 --> 24:25.718
Ray! Hey, Ray! Ray!

24:27.759 --> 24:29.896
Hey, Dicky!

24:29.907 --> 24:33.356
- How are you doing, man?
- How are you?

24:33.359 --> 24:36.749
165 pounds. ESPN screwed us.

24:36.761 --> 24:39.849
- The guy was huge.
- You know what I'm saying?

24:40.700 --> 24:42.441
You know, I knocked Ray down.

24:42.465 --> 24:44.942
I look like shit, but I knocked Ray down.

24:44.966 --> 24:47.326
Let me buy you guys a drink,
all right? You want a cold one?

24:47.343 --> 24:48.743
- No, no, no...
- A cold one!

24:48.757 --> 24:51.650
I've got to leave.
I've got a plane to catch. Next time.

24:51.659 --> 24:54.606
Hey, Ray. HBO is making
a movie on me, you know?

24:55.693 --> 24:57.511
Can they call you?

24:57.535 --> 24:59.543
I'm going to get a fight.

24:59.554 --> 25:02.407
I'd like you to be there, for old times' sake.
You can commentate or something.

25:02.419 --> 25:04.267
What's the movie about?

25:04.288 --> 25:06.319
My comeback, right?

25:06.343 --> 25:09.333
- Call me.
- I'll call you.

25:09.348 --> 25:11.878
Don't be a stranger.

25:11.890 --> 25:13.217
He's my old pal.

25:17.601 --> 25:19.856
- You going to the hospital?
- What is that?

25:21.273 --> 25:23.668
Look, Mick. Nobody's got heart like you.

25:23.691 --> 25:26.487
You're a very talented fighter,
but you're not getting the right fights.

25:26.507 --> 25:28.246
It's killing your chances.

25:28.258 --> 25:30.430
- What's he talking to Mike Toma about?
- I don't know what that is.

25:30.453 --> 25:32.284
I want to give you a real shot.

25:32.308 --> 25:35.689
I want you to come with me.
I want to pay you to train with my guys.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.563
- Where?
- Las Vegas.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.562
Do it right and make one last run
at this thing before it's too late.

25:40.585 --> 25:42.350
What about my brother?

25:42.361 --> 25:44.968
With all due respect,
he's too much trouble.

25:44.991 --> 25:48.057
You owe it to yourself to come to Vegas.

25:48.069 --> 25:50.805
Come on, Mick. What has Dicky done for you?

25:50.828 --> 25:53.775
He gets you into fights.
He lets you get beat like you did tonight.

25:53.787 --> 25:57.662
You know you never should have been in that fight.
Eighteen pounds. Think of it that way.

25:57.669 --> 25:59.312
You should have given it up.

26:01.073 --> 26:03.727
Get out of the car there. Come on, you!

26:03.739 --> 26:06.490
- Sit the hell down.
- Just a little more scotch for Mom, okay?

26:06.502 --> 26:10.733
Here you go. Nice and easy.
Don't hurt yourself coming back, old broad.

26:12.083 --> 26:15.762
Oh, my God, that Sugar Ray...
He's a beautiful man, isn't he? Right?

26:15.772 --> 26:17.334
A beautiful man.

26:17.357 --> 26:19.330
You should have seen the way
he was looking at her.

26:20.321 --> 26:23.109
- He's a pretty man, huh?
- He's a good guy. I like him. I know.

26:23.128 --> 26:26.474
I seen him ringside, and he was
so happy seeing me and Mick together.

26:26.492 --> 26:29.768
You know he's all about family, that guy.
Likes to see a family stick together.

26:29.786 --> 26:33.479
Mick, what'd Mike Toma want
with you last night, huh?

26:33.499 --> 26:36.012
He wants to train me in Vegas.

26:36.029 --> 26:38.471
You can't trust that guy, Micky.
He ain't family, you know?

26:38.495 --> 26:39.880
You don't know him.

26:39.904 --> 26:43.126
He say anything about me?
He say I could come?

26:43.138 --> 26:44.934
He didn't mention you.

26:46.943 --> 26:49.796
What are you going to do in Vegas
without your brother, huh?

26:49.817 --> 26:52.048
That guy just wants to use you,
like a piece of toilet paper.

26:52.071 --> 26:55.194
What are you going to do in Vegas
without Dicky? Without your family?

26:55.197 --> 26:57.498
- I know. That's what I told him.
- You told him that, right?

26:57.522 --> 27:00.246
Yeah, I told him. I said
I need to be with my family.

27:00.269 --> 27:02.880
That's right.
Nothing wrong with that.

27:02.904 --> 27:05.686
Sugar Ray said call him.
We're going to call him, baby.

27:05.710 --> 27:08.176
You guys can spar a little, right?

27:10.353 --> 27:14.932
There's my champ.
Daddy's home. Daddy's home!

27:16.025 --> 27:17.927
I love you...

27:19.653 --> 27:21.484
Your face hurting you, sweetheart?

27:22.741 --> 27:24.699
Because it's killing me.

27:25.423 --> 27:27.325
- Come on...
- Uncle Micky win the fight?

27:27.347 --> 27:29.908
No, Uncle Micky didn't win this time.
Not this time.

27:29.919 --> 27:33.841
Hey, Mick. Take care.
I'll call you tomorrow.

27:33.865 --> 27:36.260
Cheer up. We'll get you another fight.

27:36.269 --> 27:38.864
I don't know, Mom.
I don't think I want to do this no more.

27:38.887 --> 27:41.825
- What don't you want to do no more?
- I just don't want to do it anymore.

27:41.847 --> 27:44.691
- What are you talking...
- Hey, Mick.

27:44.714 --> 27:47.567
ESPN screwed us. They owe us.

27:47.568 --> 27:50.781
We'll get another fight.
You heal up.

27:50.804 --> 27:53.176
- It'll be okay.
- Yeah, listen to your brother.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.469
They owe us big-time, sweetheart.

27:55.489 --> 27:58.612
Hey, maybe they'll even do Dicky's
comeback fight. What do you think, huh?

27:59.634 --> 28:02.628
Oh, come on. Cheer up.
You take a little soap when you get home.

28:02.651 --> 28:04.859
Have a day or two to think about it.
I'll find you a better fight, sweetheart.

28:04.882 --> 28:06.667
Much better fight.
I'm going to talk to them.

28:06.687 --> 28:09.246
- For Christ's sake, Alice.
- What?

28:09.258 --> 28:12.303
- He's been through the ringer. Leave him alone.
- What are you talking about?

28:12.328 --> 28:15.358
- Leave him some time to himself.
- What is your fucking problem?

28:15.992 --> 28:18.240
Where's Micky?
Is Micky not going to come in?

28:18.252 --> 28:22.118
No, he's not coming in.
He needs to get back and get some rest.

28:22.142 --> 28:23.699
Come on. Let's go inside.

28:23.708 --> 28:26.032
He's going to go rest.
He's all grumpy.

28:26.044 --> 28:29.085
He's tired. He's beat up.
He's a little embarrassed, I think.

29:28.194 --> 29:29.721
Who is it?

29:51.355 --> 29:53.249
I saw the shade move.

29:54.343 --> 29:56.703
Micky, the shade is still moving.
I saw you come to the window.

29:56.727 --> 29:58.289
I know you're in there.

29:59.088 --> 30:01.002
The least you can do
is open up this door

30:01.025 --> 30:03.561
and tell me to my face
why you didn't call me yesterday.

30:09.685 --> 30:11.211
Why did you stand me up last night?

30:12.801 --> 30:16.019
I started to call.
I was going to call. I just couldn't.

30:16.031 --> 30:17.608
Because you lost the fight?

30:17.629 --> 30:20.435
Maybe, yeah.
Because I lost the fight.

30:20.447 --> 30:22.358
How do you know my house anyway?

30:22.374 --> 30:25.203
I asked my brother.

30:25.204 --> 30:29.148
Your thing's coming off.
And your other thing.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.957
You got any tape?

30:40.874 --> 30:43.520
Did the black Jewish guy
do this to you?

30:44.119 --> 30:46.703
I didn't get to fight the black Jewish guy.

30:47.950 --> 30:50.176
You didn't get to go head, body, head?

30:51.262 --> 30:53.563
Saoul Mamby got the flu.

30:53.587 --> 30:56.769
Guy that took his place had twenty pounds
on me. I never should have fought him.

30:58.383 --> 31:00.122
Why did you?

31:00.145 --> 31:02.490
Nobody would have got paid.

31:03.454 --> 31:06.000
Everybody said I could beat him.

31:06.011 --> 31:08.465
Who's everybody?

31:08.477 --> 31:10.128
My mother and my brother.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.971
So are you going to take me
to dinner and a movie, or what?

31:44.340 --> 31:46.277
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:49.555 --> 31:51.562
- You look great.
- Thank you.

31:51.574 --> 31:53.432
You've got a nice house, too.

31:53.456 --> 31:54.876
It's an apartment building.

31:54.900 --> 31:57.527
There's five of them in there.
One of my old roommates lives with me.

31:57.550 --> 31:59.206
Roommate?
What, were you in the army?

31:59.229 --> 32:01.412
- College.
- College? Wow.

32:01.424 --> 32:04.183
Yeah, a lot of good it did me.
I work in a bar.

32:04.206 --> 32:06.848
You seem to enjoy it.
Very popular down there.

32:06.864 --> 32:09.753
Ugh, yeah. Popular.
I've got to get out of there.

32:09.776 --> 32:12.617
If I don't drink while I'm working
I'll fucking kill myself.

32:12.631 --> 32:15.740
- What college?
- URI. Full boat.

32:15.756 --> 32:18.020
- A full boat's a scholarship, right?
- Yeah.

32:18.032 --> 32:19.487
For what?

32:19.503 --> 32:22.959
- I was a high-jumper.
- High-jumper? You've got to be kidding me.

32:22.961 --> 32:26.355
Fuck you. I was good.
I was New England champ. I cleared 5'8".

32:26.367 --> 32:29.267
- Wow.
- Never graduated. I partied too hard.

32:29.290 --> 32:30.629
You?

32:46.213 --> 32:48.104
What are we doing in richie-rich Lexington?

32:48.127 --> 32:49.665
You come to this theater a lot?

32:49.681 --> 32:51.724
Yeah, it's a good theater.
They've got good movies here.

32:51.736 --> 32:54.801
- Yeah? Like what?
- Belly Epi-cue.

32:54.825 --> 32:56.875
I think it's Bell Epic.

32:56.899 --> 32:58.618
It's epic. Bell Epic.

32:58.619 --> 33:02.036
Belle Epoque.
The New York Times don't lie.

33:02.050 --> 33:03.978
Well I never heard of it.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.184
Where'd you hear about it?
The New York Times?

33:06.208 --> 33:08.180
No, a guy from work.

33:08.192 --> 33:10.529
And the cinematography
is supposed to be gorgeous.

33:10.541 --> 33:11.574
Oh. Cool.

33:39.282 --> 33:42.288
That's the movie you wanted to see?

33:42.311 --> 33:44.520
There wasn't even any good sex in it.

33:44.543 --> 33:47.729
Had to read the whole fucking movie.
Fucking subtitled.

33:49.194 --> 33:52.796
Some guy from a road crew recommended it
to you? A fucking subtitled movie?

33:54.694 --> 33:56.467
What's going on, huh?

33:56.481 --> 33:59.916
What's going on? You got a girlfriend
or something? You hiding me from her?

33:59.927 --> 34:01.533
I don't have a girlfriend, all right?

34:02.889 --> 34:05.343
I like you.

34:05.367 --> 34:08.608
I came here because
I don't want to show my face in Lowell.

34:08.619 --> 34:11.050
I told everybody I was going to win
that fight and get back on track.

34:11.054 --> 34:13.779
I told my daughter I was going to get
a bigger apartment so she could move in.

34:13.791 --> 34:15.752
You don't think I wanted to call you?

34:15.763 --> 34:18.018
I was embarrassed.

34:18.036 --> 34:20.416
I'm sick of being a fucking disappointment.

34:25.429 --> 34:28.523
You really think your family
is looking out for you?

34:31.100 --> 34:33.167
Don't say that. I don't like that.

34:33.190 --> 34:35.960
What else I can say
after what you told me?

34:37.806 --> 34:39.706
Look at your face.

34:40.891 --> 34:42.804
Look at you.

35:06.619 --> 35:08.438
Bullshit, Lou.

35:08.439 --> 35:13.066
I'm not going to stop calling until you
make this right and get us a fight that's fair.

35:13.089 --> 35:15.639
My boy could have got killed last time.

35:17.855 --> 35:19.734
Yeah, like what?

35:20.669 --> 35:23.534
Just don't tell me he just got
off the fucking couch.

35:24.868 --> 35:26.007
Mm-hm.

35:28.343 --> 35:29.920
Coming off a loss?

35:30.947 --> 35:33.965
That sounds very interesting.
I'll get back to you.

35:33.977 --> 35:36.971
Got a great opportunity here.

35:36.983 --> 35:38.587
We've got to go find Micky.

35:38.599 --> 35:40.593
Nobody's seen him for, like, three weeks.

35:42.384 --> 35:43.864
Jesus...

35:44.846 --> 35:47.401
Used to be Dicky we couldn't find.
Now it's both of them?

35:47.402 --> 35:49.621
Mom, I think he's with that girl from the bar.

35:49.629 --> 35:52.797
- What girl?
- It's that fucking girl, Charlene.

35:52.821 --> 35:55.075
That's who he's with. That girl from the bar.

35:55.087 --> 35:58.791
George was all fucking eager
for them to get together.

35:58.815 --> 36:01.351
- I heard she's into three-ways.
- Yeah, with other girls.

36:01.374 --> 36:03.397
Yeah, like one of those MTV girls.

36:03.420 --> 36:05.663
MTV girls? What are you talking about?

36:05.675 --> 36:06.773
Wild.

36:06.784 --> 36:09.708
She acts all fucking superior
because she went to college.

36:11.034 --> 36:13.852
You girls just go find your brother Micky.

36:13.875 --> 36:17.293
Tell him I've got important business to discuss.

36:17.317 --> 36:19.239
I've got to go find Dicky.

36:28.435 --> 36:30.247
Dicky!

37:18.656 --> 37:21.744
Hey, Mom. It's not...
It's just...

37:22.801 --> 37:24.968
It's just a friend's house.

37:26.943 --> 37:28.378
Come on, whatever.

37:42.654 --> 37:46.434
<i>I started a joke,</i>

37:46.435 --> 37:51.546
<i>which started the whole world crying.</i>

37:51.558 --> 37:55.785
<i>Oh, if only I'd seen</i>

37:55.797 --> 37:59.820
<i>that the joke was on me.</i>

37:59.844 --> 38:03.718
<i>I started to cry,</i>

38:03.742 --> 38:08.949
<i>which started the whole world laughing.</i>

38:08.961 --> 38:12.871
<i>Oh, if only I'd seen</i>

38:12.883 --> 38:16.348
<i>that the joke was on me.</i>

38:16.359 --> 38:20.363
<i>I looked at the skies,</i>

38:20.378 --> 38:26.167
<i>running my hands over my eyes,</i>

38:26.179 --> 38:31.851
<i>and I fell out of bed,</i>

38:31.863 --> 38:34.646
<i>hurting my head...</i>

38:51.036 --> 38:54.160
So you're Beaver,
and you're Red Bear.

38:54.171 --> 38:55.710
Red beard.

38:55.733 --> 38:58.269
She's Red Dog, and that's Beaver.

38:58.275 --> 39:00.828
You're Red Dog.
You're Beaver.

39:00.851 --> 39:03.481
- Yeah, don't use those names.
- It's just for family.

39:03.493 --> 39:04.937
Be nice.

39:05.524 --> 39:07.497
Don't use the nicknames.

39:08.734 --> 39:10.970
What the fuck will I call them then?

39:11.754 --> 39:13.410
Speaking of family...

39:26.169 --> 39:27.426
Hello.

39:28.938 --> 39:31.267
- Alice, this is Charlene.
- Hi.

39:33.435 --> 39:35.595
I've heard a lot about you.

39:35.605 --> 39:37.331
Really? I've heard a lot about you, too.

39:37.354 --> 39:39.393
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Same thing you meant.

39:39.410 --> 39:41.371
Can we just sit down and talk about business?

39:42.249 --> 39:46.578
I got you another fight, Mick.
Just like I said I would.

39:47.568 --> 39:51.002
- Lou Gold and ESPN made it right.
- Just like I told you.

39:51.026 --> 39:55.253
Joe Mellenk. Six weeks. Foxwoods.

39:55.254 --> 39:59.012
Ten in eight. He's nothing.

39:59.035 --> 40:01.888
- And they're going to pay us twenty grand.
- $17,500, technically.

40:01.905 --> 40:06.296
$17,500, which is still good money, Mick.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.201
Yeah.

40:10.544 --> 40:14.204
That's good, Dick. I'm just trying to
figure out what's best for me.

40:17.963 --> 40:19.906
Like what, huh?

40:23.827 --> 40:26.738
What's best for you, sweetheart?

40:26.762 --> 40:29.569
Come on, Mick. I thought you'd be more excited.
Why aren't you more excited?

40:29.593 --> 40:33.491
It's a good fight, good money.
I got something with Lou Gold.

40:33.515 --> 40:35.301
He knows us.

40:36.241 --> 40:39.669
I know, Mom. I just don't want things
going the way they've been going.

40:39.681 --> 40:43.718
Mick, that last fight was unfair.
It was unfair.

40:43.731 --> 40:46.608
- And we ain't going to repeat that, right?
- Oh, not on your life.

40:48.365 --> 40:50.866
You know, buddy,
it's just you in the ring.

40:50.878 --> 40:52.463
Yeah, I know it's just me in the ring.

40:52.475 --> 40:54.624
But I don't like the way
things have been going here.

40:54.646 --> 40:55.720
- Where?
- Where?

40:55.744 --> 40:58.726
Here, this, us, Lowell, the whole routine.

40:58.750 --> 41:01.566
- George, stay out of it!
- You're doing all the talking.

41:01.591 --> 41:04.561
- Let him talk. Listen.
- I'm asking him.

41:04.579 --> 41:07.631
- You're telling him. Listen.
- Stay out of it.

41:07.643 --> 41:09.827
Hey, don't tell me to stay out of it.

41:09.839 --> 41:12.058
Mick, what's the problem?

41:13.164 --> 41:15.853
- Problems.
- What problems?

41:15.878 --> 41:18.388
- Problems...
- Like what?

41:19.609 --> 41:23.475
Like maybe you
not showing up on time to train.

41:23.494 --> 41:26.805
Like maybe him having to
come find you in a crack house

41:26.822 --> 41:29.982
when you're supposed to be at the airport.

41:31.987 --> 41:36.182
I'm sorry. I don't know who you are.
Why are you talking?

41:36.194 --> 41:39.294
I'm Charlene. We just met.

41:39.317 --> 41:42.684
We're together. Do we need to do this again?
Hi, I'm Charlene.

41:42.707 --> 41:45.528
- Hi, Charlene.
- Hi.

41:45.529 --> 41:47.396
- Hi, I'm Charlene.
- Hi, Charlene.

41:47.408 --> 41:48.993
Hey, we're together.

41:50.279 --> 41:51.911
What are you going to do, Mick?

41:51.935 --> 41:54.471
Listen to some MTV girl who works in a bar?

41:54.486 --> 41:56.459
What does she know about boxing?

41:56.478 --> 42:01.702
I know they're going to Vegas
and getting paid to train year-round.

42:01.714 --> 42:04.469
Sounds a hell of a lot better than
what you've got him doing here.

42:07.798 --> 42:10.226
You going to let her talk like that
to your mother?

42:10.245 --> 42:11.595
Come on, Micky.

42:11.612 --> 42:14.657
I told you, we're together.
This is my girlfriend. I want her here.

42:16.179 --> 42:20.226
I have done everything.
Everything I could for you, Micky.

42:21.558 --> 42:23.495
This MTV girl comes along...

42:23.519 --> 42:26.580
Stop calling me an MTV girl,
whatever the fuck that means.

42:26.603 --> 42:28.467
- Skank.
- Wild.

42:30.188 --> 42:34.767
I've been doing this over fifteen years.
She comes in, disrespects me...

42:34.791 --> 42:37.800
She don't mean no disrespect, okay?

42:37.812 --> 42:40.868
I had a chance to get paid to train year-round.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.516
Year-round, okay?
That's all she's talking about.

42:43.539 --> 42:45.594
I would hope that you guys
could appreciate that.

42:45.606 --> 42:48.341
I know what you're talking about, all right?
I could have had that.

42:50.136 --> 42:54.927
You know, I had opportunities
like maybe you're going to have.

42:55.436 --> 43:00.641
Now, you want money
so you can train year-round? Yeah?

43:01.580 --> 43:03.336
I'll get you money
so you can train year-round.

43:03.347 --> 43:04.506
- You?
- Yeah, I'll do it.

43:04.517 --> 43:05.362
- Trust me.
- How?

43:05.379 --> 43:07.880
Hey, trust me, all right?

43:07.899 --> 43:09.082
Done.

43:11.162 --> 43:14.344
All right? Charlene?
Yeah? Everyone?

43:20.103 --> 43:23.191
So you put in $200...

43:23.215 --> 43:25.258
Then you get ten other people
to put in $200...

43:27.148 --> 43:30.371
And you've got your $2000.

43:35.235 --> 43:38.892
- Everybody give you $200?
- No, not everybody. Just ten of you.

43:38.903 --> 43:40.207
Ten lucky ones.

43:44.332 --> 43:45.917
- You'll rip us off.
- No, no.

43:45.935 --> 43:48.565
- Give me another $200.
- You give me $200!

43:49.598 --> 43:53.331
No, you get that from ten other people
who you offer the opportunity to.

43:53.332 --> 43:55.809
Right? You understand? No?

44:00.494 --> 44:04.266
He thinks you think
Cambodian people are stupid.

44:04.289 --> 44:06.074
I love Cambodian people!

44:06.086 --> 44:09.459
I mean, look. Look at Karen.

44:09.483 --> 44:11.837
She's my girlfriend.
She's beautiful. I love her.

44:11.860 --> 44:15.265
And Brian. We work on a road crew together.

44:15.283 --> 44:16.469
Not so much lately.

44:16.483 --> 44:18.584
Brian, we work on a road crew together.

44:18.608 --> 44:21.144
You haven't been showing up,
that's what I'm saying.

44:21.160 --> 44:23.777
This isn't any kind of Cambodian thing.

44:23.778 --> 44:26.033
White people do this to other white people.

44:26.044 --> 44:28.393
- It's what makes the world go around.
- I don't think that's helping.

44:28.416 --> 44:32.302
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...

44:37.223 --> 44:42.014
I mean, they didn't understand.
They're practically on my game...

44:42.025 --> 44:45.454
Usually they listen to what I say,
but they just didn't understand

44:45.477 --> 44:49.194
the opportunity. I mean, it was awesome.
What were we talking about?

44:49.203 --> 44:51.293
- Before you fought Sugar Ray.
- Right, right, right.

44:51.305 --> 44:56.260
Sugar Ray was too much, too soon.
I needed to build up slow.

44:57.845 --> 45:02.240
- What's this movie about again?
- I told you, it's about crack addiction.

45:02.263 --> 45:05.105
Showing what it really is
so kids can see it for real.

45:08.485 --> 45:10.352
Fuck.

45:12.524 --> 45:14.755
We've got to get Mick's money.

45:27.139 --> 45:29.299
Yeah!
That was awesome!

46:14.554 --> 46:17.596
- Get out of the car!
- Oh, shit!

46:19.428 --> 46:22.797
Put your hands on the roof!
Put your hands on the roof, that's it!

46:22.798 --> 46:24.489
- Empty your pockets.
- Are you a cop?

46:24.513 --> 46:27.741
Get on the fucking sidewalk, move!
Fucking move! Don't turn around!

46:27.759 --> 46:31.046
Don't turn around!
We'll have to take your vehicle.

46:31.069 --> 46:33.417
- How am I going to get home?
- That's your problem.

46:34.922 --> 46:37.071
How much we got here? Count it.

46:40.834 --> 46:42.565
What the fuck?

46:42.566 --> 46:45.196
That's the guy!
He did it to me and he's doing it again!

46:45.213 --> 46:47.302
Get on the ground right now!

47:24.221 --> 47:27.368
Open the door!
I've got to get off the fucking street!

47:29.301 --> 47:31.471
I'm trying to get off the fucking street!

47:50.339 --> 47:54.998
It's Dicky. The cops are fucking punching him.
They're beating him. He needs help.

47:57.299 --> 47:59.606
Stay here. Don't get up. Stay here.

47:59.614 --> 48:02.456
Listen to him. Stay right here.

48:02.467 --> 48:05.175
Are you fucking kidding me?

48:12.833 --> 48:13.984
Hey what the fuck?
Come on.

48:14.001 --> 48:16.152
Just put him in the car.
You don't need to do that.

48:19.029 --> 48:21.387
Want to get involved?
Now you're involved.

48:25.804 --> 48:27.741
He's a fighter.
Break his fucking hands

48:43.026 --> 48:46.712
Micky your hand...
Your hand...

48:51.162 --> 48:53.351
Separate cars, separate cells.

48:53.358 --> 48:55.798
I don't want them making up
some bullshit defense story.

48:55.823 --> 48:58.476
Come on, folks, time to go home.
Let's go.

49:00.802 --> 49:02.751
- Hey, Dicky!
- What the fuck, man?

49:02.762 --> 49:05.193
- Dicky!
- Jesus Christ.

49:07.479 --> 49:09.310
His hands...

49:36.874 --> 49:40.608
Welcome back, Dicky.
That's 27 arrests.

49:48.780 --> 49:53.852
Ward: One count of disturbing the peace,
released on your own recognizance.

49:53.876 --> 49:57.757
Eklund: Three counts of assault
and battery on a police officer,

49:57.777 --> 50:01.698
two counts of resisting arrest,
two counts of larceny from a person,

50:01.722 --> 50:04.129
two counts of impersonating
a police officer.

50:04.146 --> 50:07.258
Bail set at $25,000.

50:07.281 --> 50:10.038
Case continued two weeks from today.

50:11.712 --> 50:15.827
I'm wondering about the File 357.

50:15.850 --> 50:18.915
I need a copy of the discovery report,
as well.

50:23.092 --> 50:26.026
- You're going to say it was self-defense, right?
- What?

50:26.027 --> 50:28.189
You're going to say it was self-defense, right?

50:28.211 --> 50:30.493
You came outside, you seen them beating on me.
I didn't do nothing.

50:30.505 --> 50:33.427
I was just waiting outside like anybody else.
Mick, I was doing it for you.

50:33.429 --> 50:34.943
- You did it for me?
- Yes.

50:34.967 --> 50:37.973
Do me a favor. Don't do fucking
nothing for me no more, okay?

50:37.986 --> 50:41.684
- I'm fucking done lying for you.
- What are you going to do without me, huh?

50:41.696 --> 50:45.136
Huh?
This ain't how it was going to go down.

50:45.154 --> 50:48.383
They should have just put me in the car, huh?

50:48.407 --> 50:51.131
Mick, come on! Mick!

51:04.231 --> 51:06.767
Dicky, hey! What's up, Dicky?

51:08.739 --> 51:11.076
Hey, that's the man!

51:11.088 --> 51:13.172
- Hey!
- Hey!

51:14.170 --> 51:16.635
Hey, you knocked out Sugar Ray!

51:16.647 --> 51:19.570
Dicky! Dicky! Dicky!

52:02.252 --> 52:03.014
Who is it?

52:09.788 --> 52:12.180
I don't want to see you, Micky.

52:12.195 --> 52:13.601
Charlene...

52:13.613 --> 52:15.548
I can't take it.

52:15.560 --> 52:18.448
I'm not going to let you
or your family drag me down.

52:18.472 --> 52:20.464
I'm quitting, Charlene, okay?

52:20.487 --> 52:23.375
I'm done fighting.
I don't need it anymore.

52:24.007 --> 52:26.891
- That's fucking stupid.
- What? Why?

52:27.594 --> 52:31.536
Because it's sad that you let them take it
away from you with their stupid bullshit.

52:33.381 --> 52:35.354
What else I can do, Charlene?

52:36.650 --> 52:38.094
There's a lot you can do, Micky.

52:38.118 --> 52:42.222
There's this guy that your dad wants you to meet,
you just don't think you can do it without Dicky.

52:42.920 --> 52:44.218
Charlene...

52:45.392 --> 52:47.741
- Don't call.
- Come on.

52:48.980 --> 52:50.925
Don't call me, okay?

52:59.747 --> 53:02.036
Hey, Dicky, you hurt bad?

53:04.044 --> 53:06.228
Poor fucker.

53:40.338 --> 53:42.463
Hey, Micky, bring another bucket, huh?

53:45.016 --> 53:45.909
Good.

53:56.741 --> 53:59.688
And this Friday,
an HBO original documentary.

53:59.711 --> 54:02.869
Right here in Lowell, Mass.,
the story of Dick Eklund,

54:02.881 --> 54:05.593
the once promising boxer who turned criminal.

54:19.803 --> 54:22.114
Oh, look who it is.

54:24.828 --> 54:26.190
That's...
That's Dicky's brother.

54:26.214 --> 54:28.292
- Hey, Micky.
- Regular.

54:30.647 --> 54:31.727
Hey.

54:33.536 --> 54:35.555
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Look who's here.

54:38.091 --> 54:40.469
- Good to see you, bro.
- How you doing?

54:40.470 --> 54:43.252
How you feeling?
How's the hand?

54:43.276 --> 54:46.469
- Uh, it's getting there.
- Looks better.

54:46.481 --> 54:49.671
Why don't you come down to the gym?
We'll work out, if you want.

54:49.683 --> 54:53.642
- You fat fuck, you're getting big.
- Yeah, I know. It's just...

54:53.665 --> 54:56.166
Roofing for my father and
spending more time with Kasie.

54:56.190 --> 54:58.327
By the way, this movie on HBO, man.

54:58.350 --> 55:00.757
What are you boys looking at?

55:00.768 --> 55:03.177
The movie's not about him.
It's about his crazy brother.

55:03.193 --> 55:04.449
I should go.

55:05.283 --> 55:08.143
- Come back to the gym, Mick.
- Bye, Mick.

55:08.154 --> 55:11.064
Don't go watch that crazy shit on TV.
Don't.

55:23.552 --> 55:25.251
Going to Hollywood...

55:42.125 --> 55:45.273
Let's get this started!

55:57.115 --> 56:00.426
Lowell was the birthplace of
the Industrial Revolution in America.

56:00.449 --> 56:05.101
- Oh, that's...
- These people came to find...

56:05.125 --> 56:08.401
I used to live over there.
This town's got good memories, right?

56:08.413 --> 56:10.092
- Check it out.
- Fuck yeah.

56:10.109 --> 56:12.317
This house right up this way,
the white house...

56:12.340 --> 56:16.118
- Oh, yeah!
- First time I got my crack over here.

56:16.142 --> 56:18.455
Did you ever know they
smoke crack at the white house?

56:22.057 --> 56:24.629
The first time I did crack or whatever,
I was about twenty-three.

56:24.646 --> 56:28.004
A friend of mine gave me a gram or whatever.
Fuck I wish that never happened.

56:28.028 --> 56:32.050
Before that,
I'd be doing the silver mittens and stuff.

56:32.061 --> 56:35.948
I was the only kid.
I'd be twelve. I'm shit-faced.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.451
I'll tell you how crack was.

56:39.435 --> 56:43.732
It enters your lungs.
When it enters your lungs,

56:43.756 --> 56:46.580
- I want to watch Daddy.
- Oh, my God.

56:46.604 --> 56:50.788
- No, sweetie. You go back upstairs.
- But I want to watch Daddy on TV.

56:50.800 --> 56:54.168
No, you can't.
You can't watch Daddy now, all right?

56:54.169 --> 56:56.576
You go back upstairs and go to bed, okay?

56:56.593 --> 56:59.012
Okay, this is my boy, here. Check it out.

56:59.024 --> 57:01.058
What... What can I sell you today?
A python?

57:01.070 --> 57:04.546
Yeah, check it out, man.
They're going to buy me some.

57:07.445 --> 57:11.555
It's been a while.
I'll take anything right now.

57:11.566 --> 57:17.019
Never thought I'd kiss a fucking snake.
I always dreamed about it, but...

57:17.031 --> 57:20.833
You do a lot of shit when you're high, right?

57:22.265 --> 57:25.259
Heck, yeah.
Put it all on the map.

57:25.271 --> 57:28.454
You knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down,
didn't you say?

57:28.478 --> 57:32.536
Yeah, he knocked him down,
but I don't think it was a knockout.

57:32.548 --> 57:35.330
- I think he slipped.
- He knocked him down.

57:35.342 --> 57:37.850
- He didn't slip.
- He slipped.

57:37.862 --> 57:40.479
- Oh, Jack...
- Come on.

57:40.480 --> 57:41.995
That's a fucking lie!

57:42.012 --> 57:44.067
They say he's in trouble with drugs...

57:44.090 --> 57:46.747
What are you doing?
Are you talking shit about the family?

57:46.759 --> 57:48.790
- No, not at all.
- Yeah. I heard you say.

57:48.814 --> 57:52.195
We're not like that.
This is not what Lowell is all about.

57:52.207 --> 57:55.612
I thought he could make a comeback
and make us proud, but he didn't.

57:55.623 --> 57:58.641
- I don't know what Dicky was thinking.
- Very disappointing.

57:58.653 --> 58:02.639
You brought the city of Lowell
back thirty years. We're not happy.

58:02.651 --> 58:04.365
- Hello?
- Jimmy.

58:04.389 --> 58:07.183
Hey, will you do me a favor?
Make sure Kasie's not watching HBO?

58:07.195 --> 58:08.986
Actually, we were watching it right now, Mick,

58:08.987 --> 58:11.863
but don't worry about it.
I got it...

58:11.886 --> 58:13.601
I want her to see it.

58:13.612 --> 58:15.104
Let her see who her uncle is.

58:15.127 --> 58:16.618
- What?
- Who you are.

58:16.642 --> 58:18.895
Who I am?
What are you talking about?

58:18.918 --> 58:22.229
- Kids need to know the truth, Mick.
- Laurie, turn it off, please.

58:22.241 --> 58:25.704
She does not need to see this.
She doesn't need to see it. She's a kid.

58:26.772 --> 58:29.359
If you're on crack,

58:29.360 --> 58:32.988
you feel so much lighter.

58:33.012 --> 58:36.194
You know, you feel young.
And everything is so funny.

58:36.206 --> 58:42.527
Everything is just...
Everything is...

58:42.551 --> 58:43.850
It wasn't funny.

58:48.547 --> 58:51.554
And then it fades,
then you've got to get high again.

58:56.604 --> 59:00.641
Your part of the movie's going to end
with you going to jail.

59:03.330 --> 59:05.890
We know Dicky.
We're going to take care of him, huh?

59:09.048 --> 59:10.610
You guys can't talk to him.

59:15.204 --> 59:17.580
Turn that shit off.
Turn this off, all right?

59:17.592 --> 59:19.798
Turn it off.
Will you turn this off?

59:19.799 --> 59:21.936
I'm turning it fucking off.

59:26.346 --> 59:29.340
Hey, that's my life.
That's my fucking life up there.

59:29.351 --> 59:32.181
- I want to watch this.
- I don't care. I will fuck you up.

59:32.193 --> 59:35.617
You fucking want some?
Don't fucking try me.

59:35.641 --> 59:38.811
I still fucking won it, okay?
You fucking want some?

59:39.674 --> 59:42.339
That's my son there.
You're laughing at him?

59:44.006 --> 59:48.941
That's my son, he's crying, he needs me,
and I'm fucking stuck in here?

59:52.106 --> 59:54.736
Micky, are you watching this?

59:54.760 --> 59:56.749
What are they doing to us?

59:58.614 --> 01:00:01.726
I don't know what to tell you.

01:00:01.749 --> 01:00:05.392
You're pretending like you don't know what's going on.
He's been doing this for years.

01:00:06.691 --> 01:00:08.985
Yeah, I know it's horrible, Mom.

01:00:13.954 --> 01:00:15.480
What do you think?

01:00:15.502 --> 01:00:18.790
- You think they set him up?
- Mom, what do you think he was doing?

01:00:18.802 --> 01:00:22.277
You know, they gave him money,
gave him drugs for the movie, right?

01:00:25.719 --> 01:00:26.917
Micky?

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:50.013
- You got a new bag, huh?
- Yup.

01:02:50.036 --> 01:02:52.584
- New bracket, too?
- Yup.

01:02:52.605 --> 01:02:54.038
- What happened to the peanut?
- Don't know.

01:02:55.928 --> 01:02:57.563
Like a beach ball.

01:04:23.304 --> 01:04:24.631
Good job.

01:04:25.816 --> 01:04:28.957
- Mick, Sal Lanano.
- Hey, Mick. How you doing?

01:04:28.959 --> 01:04:32.341
- You own the cab company. Good businessman, right?
- He's very organized.

01:04:32.353 --> 01:04:34.748
- How's the hand?
- It's good, you know?

01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:37.037
It's getting better. Stronger.

01:04:37.062 --> 01:04:40.667
You know, I made a few calls already.
I just talked to Buddy Tags.

01:04:40.679 --> 01:04:45.326
He said he can set up something local.
You know, something to start back with.

01:04:45.337 --> 01:04:48.003
- Get your confidence back.
- That's it. You've got to get your confidence back.

01:04:48.026 --> 01:04:49.682
That's all.

01:04:50.997 --> 01:04:53.576
Your dad wants Sal to manage you,

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.549
and he wants me to train you,

01:04:55.572 --> 01:04:58.202
but he'll only do it on one condition.

01:05:00.269 --> 01:05:04.152
- No crazy time nonsense.
- That's how it's got to be.

01:05:04.163 --> 01:05:08.065
- No Dicky, no Alice.
- No Dicky, no Alice.

01:05:08.076 --> 01:05:11.740
I get it. I get it. I'm good. I understand.
Look, I appreciate the opportunity.

01:05:11.764 --> 01:05:14.690
Can't take the bullshit, Mick.
No offense, George.

01:05:14.696 --> 01:05:19.213
None taken. I mean, I'm going to be
the one that gets his balls cut off anyway.

01:05:20.427 --> 01:05:22.330
Yeah, you laugh.

01:05:22.341 --> 01:05:25.617
- You traitor!
- What are you doing?

01:05:26.914 --> 01:05:29.133
What the hell's the matter with you?

01:05:31.078 --> 01:05:32.887
Did that hurt? I hope it hurt!

01:05:32.909 --> 01:05:35.676
- Sal Lanano is a good man!
- A good man?

01:05:35.688 --> 01:05:38.905
- He's a legitimate businessman!
- Legitimate businessman?

01:05:38.919 --> 01:05:41.667
- What?
- Oh, my God, you know what that sounds like?

01:05:41.678 --> 01:05:44.332
- He's a crook, George!
- He owns a taxicab company!

01:05:44.355 --> 01:05:46.668
- He's organized!
- Oh, my God, he's a cab driver.

01:05:46.685 --> 01:05:48.998
- He knows everything about boxing, right?
- Yes.

01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:53.002
I don't think so! I think he's going to
steal your son's money and rob him blind!

01:05:53.026 --> 01:05:55.785
Why would you think that?
Why would you even think that?

01:05:55.802 --> 01:05:58.392
- Why can't you trust anybody?
- I know people.

01:05:58.416 --> 01:06:01.024
I know, George. You think I don't
know anything. But I know people.

01:06:01.038 --> 01:06:05.054
- I know you know things...
- And that Sal Lanana banana fucking thing...

01:06:05.078 --> 01:06:08.776
- We don't need that in our lives!
- We haven't made one dollar with these kids.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:11.687
- You betrayed me. You betrayed me.
- Oh, bullshit, I betrayed you.

01:06:11.699 --> 01:06:14.012
- You're always have to say...
- He's a fucking crook!

01:06:14.028 --> 01:06:16.952
What's Micky supposed to do?
Dicky's in jail.

01:06:16.975 --> 01:06:22.897
We're not talking about his trainer, sweetheart.
We're talking about his manager, that's me!

01:06:22.919 --> 01:06:25.339
Yeah, but Mom, maybe Micky should
try something different...

01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:27.487
What are you doing,
opening your mouth in my kitchen?

01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:29.847
You owe me $200.

01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:31.521
I said I was going to pay you next week.

01:06:31.545 --> 01:06:35.149
I don't want another word out of you.
That was last month you told me two weeks.

01:06:35.169 --> 01:06:38.445
Do you take sides against me in my own house?
You owe me money?

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:40.351
Mom's been great to Micky, Sherri.

01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:43.416
Really, who's going to look after Micky
better than his own mother?

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:46.790
It's that fucking girl, Charlene.
We've got to get rid of her, Mom.

01:06:46.814 --> 01:06:49.444
We've got to get rid of her.
It's that girl, Charlene. She's got to go.

01:06:49.467 --> 01:06:53.019
You're going to get Charlene involved in this?
Is that what you're all telling me?

01:06:53.032 --> 01:06:54.652
- Huh?
- I know where she lives.

01:06:54.664 --> 01:06:56.167
What are you picking on her for?

01:06:56.184 --> 01:06:59.166
- She lives in that yellow house on Steven Street.
- Yeah, the puke yellow.

01:06:59.178 --> 01:07:01.972
I'm going to talk to Micky.
Sort this out for myself.

01:07:01.996 --> 01:07:08.536
Yeah, sure. You go handle it with
your vigilantes. This is wrong, Alice!

01:07:15.708 --> 01:07:18.525
- I got it.
- Get out of my way!

01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:24.298
Get in the car.

01:07:46.878 --> 01:07:48.377
Micky, are you in there?

01:07:48.381 --> 01:07:50.192
Up in there on the second floor.

01:07:50.201 --> 01:07:51.330
Micky!

01:07:52.277 --> 01:07:54.332
Where the hell are you, huh?

01:07:54.356 --> 01:07:56.316
Are you up there? Come on down.

01:07:56.328 --> 01:07:58.301
Where are you?

01:07:59.099 --> 01:08:01.797
Holy shit, Micky.
Your mother and your sisters are here.

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:05.049
No, no.
Do not go out there, please.

01:08:05.054 --> 01:08:08.272
No, I'm not hiding
from your crazy fucking family.

01:08:20.341 --> 01:08:21.254
Hi.

01:08:21.258 --> 01:08:23.477
Well, well, well. Look at this.

01:08:23.488 --> 01:08:24.823
Look at what?

01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:28.100
Why are you hiding from us, Micky?

01:08:28.125 --> 01:08:29.889
- He's not hiding.
- I wasn't talking to you.

01:08:29.912 --> 01:08:31.673
I was talking to my son.

01:08:31.688 --> 01:08:35.738
- What are you doing next to her?
- I'm right here. I ain't hiding from nobody, Alice.

01:08:35.759 --> 01:08:39.352
Well you're not helping yourself with
your father's scumbag friend, Lanano.

01:08:39.374 --> 01:08:42.238
What are you going to do?
Turn your back on Dicky next, huh?

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.518
All we ever wanted for you
was to be world champion.

01:08:46.542 --> 01:08:49.348
Micky's a grown man.
He can think for himself.

01:08:49.371 --> 01:08:51.767
- Shut your mouth.
- Skank!

01:08:51.786 --> 01:08:55.438
Don't call me skank. I'll rip that
nasty hair right out of your fucking head.

01:08:55.448 --> 01:08:59.053
- I'm his mother and his manager.
- You're not my manager anymore.

01:08:59.064 --> 01:09:02.618
And I'm not waiting for Dicky, okay?
I'm not getting any younger.

01:09:02.631 --> 01:09:05.542
- Who's going to look after you, sweetheart?
- How about me?

01:09:05.566 --> 01:09:08.082
I know you don't understand it
but I had nine kids,

01:09:08.106 --> 01:09:10.066
and I love every one of you the same.

01:09:10.082 --> 01:09:12.149
You've got a funny way of showing it,
letting him get beat up,

01:09:12.173 --> 01:09:15.307
- letting him get his hand broken.
- You're crazy.

01:09:15.694 --> 01:09:18.350
What did I just say to you?

01:09:24.559 --> 01:09:25.491
Let go!

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:33.999
Fuck!

01:09:35.136 --> 01:09:37.002
Get the fuck out of here! Now!

01:09:37.738 --> 01:09:39.291
Fuck you, Charlene!

01:09:39.303 --> 01:09:41.366
- Skank!
- I want them the fuck out of here.

01:09:41.743 --> 01:09:45.136
- You're fucking dead.
- Fucking bitch!

01:09:45.845 --> 01:09:48.979
Gail! Oh, my God.
What did she do to your nose?

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:52.377
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:09:57.628 --> 01:10:01.045
What's happening to everybody?
I don't understand, sweetheart.

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:51.804
Why do you think I spell my name with an "E"?
Because I don't.

01:10:51.816 --> 01:10:54.611
- "No E" Micky Ward.
- Hey, somebody push that.

01:10:55.952 --> 01:10:58.688
- Where are we going?
- To the ring. The ring's across the street.

01:10:58.712 --> 01:11:00.825
- The ring's across the street?
- Yeah.

01:11:00.849 --> 01:11:03.415
Smaller venue. They've got
no dressing rooms over there.

01:11:03.435 --> 01:11:05.415
It's a starter, Micky.

01:11:09.652 --> 01:11:10.650
Hey.

01:11:11.883 --> 01:11:13.101
Good luck.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.237
That's it. That's it.

01:11:29.199 --> 01:11:30.914
Yeah!

01:11:35.296 --> 01:11:37.219
Yeah!

01:12:58.469 --> 01:13:00.664
Visit for Dick Eklund.

01:13:00.688 --> 01:13:02.238
Dicky!

01:13:05.633 --> 01:13:08.544
Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick.
That's good.

01:13:10.014 --> 01:13:14.112
I know you know what I'm doing.
I'm sure Alice and everybody else told you.

01:13:14.779 --> 01:13:17.576
I just wanted to tell you to your face myself.

01:13:17.599 --> 01:13:20.760
I've got a new manager and
Mickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.

01:13:21.199 --> 01:13:22.396
It's going good.

01:13:23.394 --> 01:13:26.704
Yeah. They've got you fighting Alfonso Sanchez.

01:13:26.728 --> 01:13:28.830
- On HBO.
- Bet you're proud of that.

01:13:28.847 --> 01:13:32.206
- Fucking right.
- HBO is the best at the Mexican fight. Wake up.

01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:35.516
I didn't think they were
going to be invested in me.

01:13:35.537 --> 01:13:38.132
- I've got a shot. I'm going to take it.
- Wake up.

01:13:38.146 --> 01:13:40.389
They don't care if it kills you.

01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:42.947
Mike Toma did it. He's using you.

01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:45.185
Like a stepping stone for Sanchez.

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:49.957
- Why don't you see?
- Oh, I see.

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:53.812
How could I stand a chance without
the great Dick Eklund in my corner, right?

01:13:53.836 --> 01:13:56.428
You didn't give a fuck if I got
killed by Mungin,

01:13:56.447 --> 01:13:58.725
now, all of the sudden, you're worried
Sanchez is going to hurt me?

01:13:58.740 --> 01:13:59.832
Why?

01:13:59.855 --> 01:14:03.014
Come on, Dick. Because you're stuck in here
and can't be the center of attention no more?

01:14:03.031 --> 01:14:05.268
- You need it that bad?
- It's a Mexican fight.

01:14:05.288 --> 01:14:08.129
He fights you,
hits like a fucking mule, all right?

01:14:08.138 --> 01:14:10.344
Fifteen counts undefeated. You crazy?

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:13.174
And that taxicab idiot, Lanano?
He went right for it.

01:14:13.191 --> 01:14:15.922
He's a paper gangster.
He's using you to steal money.

01:14:15.936 --> 01:14:18.666
Why can't you just shut up
and be happy for me?

01:14:19.253 --> 01:14:22.451
I've spent the last ten years of my life
in bad fights set up by you and Alice.

01:14:22.472 --> 01:14:26.926
I've finally got a good thing going for me,
and you can't be fucking happy for me? Why?

01:14:28.264 --> 01:14:30.366
What's your plan?
How are you going to fight Sanchez?

01:14:30.378 --> 01:14:32.315
I ain't going to talk about that.

01:14:32.331 --> 01:14:33.961
What's your plan?

01:14:34.431 --> 01:14:38.118
- I'm not here to talk about that.
- Bullshit. Yes you are.

01:14:39.246 --> 01:14:41.267
You watch the fight and you'll see the plan.

01:14:41.279 --> 01:14:44.719
I can't watch it. They don't let us.
It's too fucking violent, you know?

01:14:44.742 --> 01:14:45.958
Two minutes, Dicky.

01:14:45.973 --> 01:14:52.689
They let us watch a stupid documentary about crack,
but I can't watch my own brother fighting.

01:14:52.693 --> 01:14:55.945
Hey, Mick. What is it?

01:14:56.744 --> 01:15:01.200
You scared? You embarrassed because you don't
even have a plan? I'm your brother. Just tell me.

01:15:01.211 --> 01:15:04.712
- You're going to shit on it no matter what I say.
- I'm not going to shit on it. Just tell me.

01:15:07.957 --> 01:15:12.079
Go toe-to-toe, overhand right in middle rounds.
He's weak against overhand right.

01:15:13.770 --> 01:15:17.785
- Who came up with that? Fatty fuck O'Keefe?
- Fuck you, Dicky.

01:15:17.797 --> 01:15:20.662
You've got to run against this guy.
Let him burn himself out.

01:15:20.673 --> 01:15:23.138
Take it to the body, right?
Get inside, switch stances

01:15:23.162 --> 01:15:25.939
like you're going to work his right.
Hit him on the left.

01:15:25.963 --> 01:15:28.288
You ain't me.
Okay, you can't be me.

01:15:28.311 --> 01:15:31.352
You had a hard enough time being you
when you had your fucking chance,

01:15:31.372 --> 01:15:33.297
and that's why you're in here, all right?

01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:34.859
I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.

01:15:34.868 --> 01:15:37.474
I'm talking about the way you fight,
you moron!

01:15:38.766 --> 01:15:41.584
- You know I'm right. He knows I'm right.
- All right.

01:15:45.068 --> 01:15:46.865
Blow to the right.

01:15:49.788 --> 01:15:54.508
Ward just in.
29 wins, 7 losses so far.

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:59.342
Twenty KOs. He's been a little better
since he refocused himself on the sport,

01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:00.900
as J.B. pointed out.

01:16:06.271 --> 01:16:09.066
Now here's Ward's opponent, Alfonso Sanchez,

01:16:09.089 --> 01:16:14.241
out of Tijuana, Mexico.
See the record, 16 wins, 15 KOs,

01:16:14.252 --> 01:16:16.089
8 first-round KOs.

01:16:16.101 --> 01:16:20.187
There's Mike Toma, the promoter of the fight,
who has a lot invested in Sanchez.

01:16:20.202 --> 01:16:24.045
He says that Sanchez is one of the most
talented young prospects

01:16:24.057 --> 01:16:25.841
in the sport of boxing.

01:16:34.997 --> 01:16:40.915
This is really one of the saddest
kinds of fights in boxing.

01:16:40.938 --> 01:16:45.120
Micky Ward is 31 years old.
He's here because he needs the money.

01:16:45.132 --> 01:16:47.420
- He's taking a beating.
- My point is that

01:16:47.432 --> 01:16:49.710
he doesn't really have to sit here
and take this beating.

01:16:49.722 --> 01:16:52.247
- He can do something about it.
- Which is what?

01:16:52.271 --> 01:16:54.854
- Have his corner throw in the towel?
- Or fight back.

01:16:58.057 --> 01:17:01.145
You can see his power.
Every time he hits Ward, he backs him up.

01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:08.340
- Unless the referee thinks he can't...
- The referee should just stop this fight.

01:17:08.352 --> 01:17:10.477
We know that Micky doesn't want to be here.

01:17:10.494 --> 01:17:13.288
- I wouldn't make the crowd...
- No, he's fighting scared, Dick.

01:17:14.438 --> 01:17:16.493
Running away, not hitting back.

01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:20.006
Oh, Jesus. He's going to get hurt.

01:17:20.017 --> 01:17:24.762
Doing the same old shit.
Never seen such an embarrassing performance.

01:17:24.784 --> 01:17:26.839
He's doing what I told him, Mom.
He's doing what I told him.

01:17:26.851 --> 01:17:28.694
Don't worry about it.
He's doing what I told him.

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:31.576
Micky Ward showing nothing but respect.

01:17:31.594 --> 01:17:33.508
What are you running around for?
Stop running around.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:36.733
Shut the fuck up, Sal.
Shut the fuck up!

01:17:36.743 --> 01:17:39.596
I don't know what you're doing, Micky.
You want to fucking tell me?

01:17:39.608 --> 01:17:41.991
Because I don't know what you're doing.
We'd have lost all five rounds.

01:17:42.008 --> 01:17:43.946
Is that what you want?

01:17:43.963 --> 01:17:46.042
This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.

01:17:46.065 --> 01:17:48.419
You've got to show me something soon,
Mick, or I'm going to stop the fight.

01:17:48.436 --> 01:17:49.927
They're going to stop the fight, Micky.

01:17:49.936 --> 01:17:51.838
He's got to go inside, Mom.

01:17:51.851 --> 01:17:54.864
He's got to take it to the body.
He's got it.

01:17:54.865 --> 01:17:57.824
- Don't stop the fight.
- They're going to stop this fight.

01:17:57.835 --> 01:18:00.418
You've got to do something, baby.
You've got to do something.

01:18:00.433 --> 01:18:03.944
Try what we talked about, Micky.
We had a plan, and you're not doing it.

01:18:03.961 --> 01:18:05.947
- Let's go.
- All right, Micky.

01:18:05.959 --> 01:18:10.491
You've lost the first five rounds,
what's the next strategy going to be?

01:18:10.515 --> 01:18:13.876
Double right hand by Sanchez,
then a triple left hook.

01:18:13.877 --> 01:18:18.089
Couple of the left hooks landed flush
on the cheek of Micky Ward.

01:18:18.101 --> 01:18:20.283
Ward tying Sanchez up.

01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:23.396
Very curious performance by Micky Ward.

01:18:23.419 --> 01:18:28.859
Ward seems to be trying to land one big shot
to either change Sanchez's mind...

01:18:28.879 --> 01:18:33.388
And he's beginning to open up, taking
advantage of opportunities to get close to Ward

01:18:33.411 --> 01:18:39.164
and throw against a fighter who is
not defending himself by punching.

01:18:39.184 --> 01:18:42.012
Sanchez is going to try to end this fight.

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:49.818
What are you doing? Come on.

01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:52.587
Come on!

01:18:53.532 --> 01:18:56.033
He's down on an uppercut.

01:18:58.961 --> 01:19:01.759
Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.

01:19:01.769 --> 01:19:05.961
Very good. And right after Ward
threw a pretty good right hand.

01:19:05.979 --> 01:19:07.223
Mick, you all right?

01:19:09.272 --> 01:19:12.255
This is a fight that should be stopped.

01:19:12.266 --> 01:19:15.254
- Come on, head, body, head.
- Ugh.

01:19:16.801 --> 01:19:21.192
- This is not professional.
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

01:19:21.203 --> 01:19:23.305
I sure wish they paid me to watch this.

01:19:24.425 --> 01:19:27.177
Come on, Mick!
Head, body, head.

01:19:28.443 --> 01:19:31.273
That was a good body shot by Ward.

01:19:31.287 --> 01:19:34.910
- Maybe he'll turn it around.
- I'm talking about his body shot.

01:19:36.186 --> 01:19:38.838
Sanchez dropped by that shot!
Oh, my God!

01:19:38.851 --> 01:19:40.454
What a punch!

01:19:40.466 --> 01:19:43.216
The most unlikely knockout
you have ever seen!

01:19:43.228 --> 01:19:45.082
That is a kidney shot,

01:19:45.083 --> 01:19:48.769
The kind of kidney shot that's not as severe...

01:19:48.783 --> 01:19:50.232
Yeah!

01:19:50.833 --> 01:19:53.920
I still don't believe what I just saw!

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:58.002
Micky! Micky! Micky!

01:19:58.014 --> 01:19:59.587
Micky won!

01:20:01.483 --> 01:20:06.508
Now did Micky Ward just make idiots of us all
with a spectacular piece of strategy?

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:08.987
- Take another look.
- Amazing.

01:20:08.998 --> 01:20:11.288
A big win in the career of Micky Ward
of Lowell, Mass.

01:20:11.305 --> 01:20:14.851
Unbelievable defeat at the hands of Micky Ward,

01:20:14.868 --> 01:20:19.295
who had all but given away the first
half dozen rounds in the bout.

01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:23.302
I think what Micky did was he recognized
that he'd hurt the guy with the body shot.

01:20:23.325 --> 01:20:26.472
Micky's a better fighter than that
to not be running from that guy like that.

01:20:26.495 --> 01:20:28.679
Theater of the unexpected.

01:20:28.702 --> 01:20:31.427
Hey, you never know
what can happen, right?

01:20:31.450 --> 01:20:33.558
Never give up in this game, right?
Never give up.

01:20:33.583 --> 01:20:35.239
You can't make it up, folks.

01:20:35.256 --> 01:20:38.731
You know what Micky just said?
He said you can't give up in this game.

01:20:38.732 --> 01:20:42.090
Well maybe Micky Ward heard me say
he should stop this fight,

01:20:42.102 --> 01:20:45.319
- and he went out and stopped it.
- Yeah.

01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:46.976
I can't believe it.

01:20:46.988 --> 01:20:50.129
I'm looking over and I'm thinking
to myself like they were thinking:

01:20:50.135 --> 01:20:51.368
This thing is over.

01:20:51.392 --> 01:20:53.482
But I tell you what.
Even look at the commentators.

01:20:53.493 --> 01:20:56.898
They started to take their headsets off
before he was even counted out.

01:20:56.922 --> 01:20:59.235
- They just wanted to get out of there.
- Mick. Mick...

01:20:59.241 --> 01:21:02.399
I just spoke to Mike Toma again and
he just told me something very interesting.

01:21:02.411 --> 01:21:07.374
He just told me, had Sanchez won tonight,
he would have gotten the title shot.

01:21:07.375 --> 01:21:10.493
- Holy Christ, that's beautiful.
- Why? Why is that beautiful?

01:21:10.516 --> 01:21:15.284
- A title shot.
- Micky gets the shot.

01:21:15.309 --> 01:21:17.939
- Are you sure about that?
- You've got to be very clear about this,

01:21:17.951 --> 01:21:20.206
- because this is my kid's future.
- I just spoke to the guy.

01:21:20.217 --> 01:21:23.681
- Mike, come here. Look, tell these guys.
- Hey. Congratulations.

01:21:23.687 --> 01:21:25.589
- Thank you.
- Not a stepping stone anymore.

01:21:25.602 --> 01:21:28.209
I always knew you had the talent.
That was a hell of a strategy,

01:21:28.232 --> 01:21:30.781
wearing him down like that
and taking it to the body.

01:21:30.804 --> 01:21:33.453
Thirty years in the business,
I've never seen a knockout like that.

01:21:33.457 --> 01:21:36.933
Larry Merchant was writing your obituary
and Sanchez drops like he was shot with a gun.

01:21:36.938 --> 01:21:38.460
Where did you get that?

01:21:38.472 --> 01:21:41.666
That's the first thing my brother taught me.
Tap them to the head, dig into the body.

01:21:41.681 --> 01:21:43.689
- That's a hell of a body shot.
- Thank you.

01:21:43.696 --> 01:21:45.082
You ready for a title shot?

01:21:45.107 --> 01:21:47.890
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:21:47.908 --> 01:21:51.536
- That's what I was talking about.
- He's ready. You're ready, aren't you?

01:21:51.542 --> 01:21:55.181
Shea Neary in London for the title!

01:21:55.205 --> 01:21:57.506
Are you kidding me?
We've got some celebrating to do.

01:21:57.517 --> 01:21:59.455
- Yeah, I think so.
- Thank you so much.

01:21:59.478 --> 01:22:01.963
You're going to have
a great champion, my boy.

01:22:04.011 --> 01:22:06.359
It's what your brother
would have always wanted.

01:22:06.383 --> 01:22:07.991
He's not even going to be there.

01:22:34.129 --> 01:22:37.358
- Hey!
- Daddy!

01:22:37.372 --> 01:22:39.580
- Hey there, buddy.
- Daddy, Daddy!

01:22:40.688 --> 01:22:43.988
Good to see you! Oh!

01:22:44.006 --> 01:22:48.198
That's a good hug!
That's a good hug! Oh yeah!

01:22:48.204 --> 01:22:50.529
- Sweetheart!
- Hi, Mom.

01:22:50.552 --> 01:22:53.112
Oh, you look so good.

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:54.673
Oh, my God.

01:23:03.406 --> 01:23:06.399
- You have clean teeth.
- I do! Look at my teeth!

01:23:06.411 --> 01:23:08.630
I got new teeth. Everything.

01:23:08.647 --> 01:23:10.115
How do you think I look?

01:23:10.127 --> 01:23:11.489
- Good.
- Yeah?

01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:25.308
- Are you going to carry me?
- No.

01:23:25.331 --> 01:23:28.208
And more cake. Ice cream...

01:23:28.232 --> 01:23:32.294
- Ice cream with cake.
- Ice cream with cake and cake and cake.

01:23:32.635 --> 01:23:35.987
Ice cream, cake and cake.
Ice cream, cake and cake.

01:23:36.002 --> 01:23:37.129
Quacker!

01:23:42.878 --> 01:23:43.852
Mom.

01:23:57.302 --> 01:23:59.885
- They gave you some new teeth, huh?
- Yeah.

01:24:04.779 --> 01:24:08.114
- Hey, George. They let you out of the house now?
- Ha, yeah.

01:24:08.125 --> 01:24:11.941
- Run him out of the house, Mom?
- Hey, look. I want you to meet Sal Lanano.

01:24:18.535 --> 01:24:20.313
How you doing, Dicky?

01:24:22.664 --> 01:24:24.449
Let's spar, huh?

01:24:32.364 --> 01:24:33.479
Hi, Charlene.

01:24:59.626 --> 01:25:02.843
- Welcome back!
- Shh! It's supposed to be a surprise!

01:25:02.866 --> 01:25:04.816
I'm running late.

01:25:04.827 --> 01:25:07.093
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:25:07.108 --> 01:25:10.725
Mick, I can't even tell you.
Being back in this smelly-ass locker room...

01:25:10.736 --> 01:25:13.496
Getting back with you is what got me through.

01:25:13.503 --> 01:25:15.323
You look good. Your eyes are clear.

01:25:15.346 --> 01:25:17.871
- Yeah?
- You know...

01:25:18.994 --> 01:25:21.772
Alice says prison might have been
the best thing for me.

01:25:21.788 --> 01:25:25.111
It got me clean. Got me clear up here.

01:25:26.567 --> 01:25:28.353
It's a beautiful thing, Dick.

01:25:29.923 --> 01:25:31.925
I've got to talk to you about something.

01:25:32.776 --> 01:25:33.563
Yeah.

01:25:36.344 --> 01:25:38.387
The old locker, huh?

01:25:41.406 --> 01:25:44.165
I made a promise to them
I wouldn't work with you again.

01:25:52.954 --> 01:25:53.940
Huh?

01:25:54.738 --> 01:25:58.012
I had to, after everything that happened.
I'm sorry.

01:26:03.334 --> 01:26:05.156
You sticking to that?

01:26:07.294 --> 01:26:09.067
I'm glad you're back.

01:26:09.595 --> 01:26:10.887
You look good.

01:26:12.038 --> 01:26:14.093
I don't know what else to say.

01:26:21.872 --> 01:26:24.877
- Mick, you fucking kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

01:26:29.753 --> 01:26:32.207
- Hey, Micky.
- Micky, come on in.

01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:35.487
You're too loud.
You've got to do this at home, please.

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.355
- What are you talking about?
- Mom, please.

01:26:40.596 --> 01:26:43.156
All right, girls. Let's pack it up.

01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:10.705
- Why?
- Let's get it put away.

01:27:10.717 --> 01:27:14.533
If that's what Micky wants,
we're going to put it away.

01:27:14.551 --> 01:27:17.353
- There's your brother.
- Dicky!

01:27:18.421 --> 01:27:20.828
Hey there. Hey there.

01:27:24.483 --> 01:27:26.970
It's nice. It's nice.

01:27:27.465 --> 01:27:30.154
- Been working on it for two weeks.
- Hey, Sherri, come on. Stop.

01:27:30.177 --> 01:27:34.134
All right, girls, come on. Let's go home.
It's not the time to do this, obviously.

01:27:39.399 --> 01:27:43.047
- What's going on?
- We ain't going to work together.

01:27:43.071 --> 01:27:45.032
They don't want me to work with him.

01:27:45.055 --> 01:27:47.030
What are you talking about?

01:27:47.477 --> 01:27:49.355
That's not right.

01:27:49.796 --> 01:27:52.684
Micky never would have
won Sanchez without Dicky.

01:27:52.707 --> 01:27:56.394
- That's fucking bullshit! Take it back!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:27:56.406 --> 01:28:00.093
- Don't you fucking talk to my mother like that.
- Fuck you!

01:28:02.613 --> 01:28:04.567
Why don't you ask Micky?

01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:07.509
We're going to train. They've got to go.

01:28:07.522 --> 01:28:09.495
They've got to go, Mick.
Come on.

01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:11.388
- You all right?
- Ask him, George.

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:14.343
Ask him if he would have won Sanchez
without his brother.

01:28:18.047 --> 01:28:20.826
No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez
if it wasn't for Dicky.

01:28:21.596 --> 01:28:24.592
- How can you say that to O'Keefe?
- Because it's true.

01:28:25.268 --> 01:28:29.180
I went in with our game plan and it wasn't working
so I went back to what I learned with Dicky.

01:28:29.194 --> 01:28:31.894
And I wouldn't have won without you,
either, O'Keefe, okay?

01:28:32.834 --> 01:28:36.003
I mean, you know that.
We worked hard. You got me ready.

01:28:36.014 --> 01:28:38.711
You got your confidence
and your focus from O'Keefe,

01:28:38.723 --> 01:28:41.576
and from Sal,
and from your father, and from me.

01:28:44.014 --> 01:28:45.787
- Dicky is a junk bag.
- Hey!

01:28:45.810 --> 01:28:47.137
He's a junk bag!

01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:48.732
- Fuck you, Charlene.
- Oh, fuck you!

01:28:48.756 --> 01:28:49.818
I'm sober.

01:28:49.821 --> 01:28:52.569
Oh, yeah. And I'm sure you're going to need
something for something now that you're out.

01:28:52.593 --> 01:28:54.342
- "Oh, my back! Oh, my back!"
- Fuck you!

01:28:54.359 --> 01:28:56.649
- What are you always picking on me for, huh?
- No, fuck you!

01:28:56.661 --> 01:28:59.024
And what about O'Keefe?
We're in the same boat.

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.801
One day at a fucking time, right, O'Keefe?
You and me.

01:29:01.811 --> 01:29:04.558
It's all right for him to be here?
Why am I the fucking problem?

01:29:04.569 --> 01:29:06.718
- I'm his blood! I'm his family!
- You're the problem!

01:29:06.738 --> 01:29:10.296
I'm the one fighting, okay?
Not you, not you, and not you.

01:29:11.649 --> 01:29:13.583
- I know what I need.
- And you need Dicky?

01:29:13.606 --> 01:29:15.027
I want Dicky back.

01:29:16.522 --> 01:29:18.800
And I want you, Charlene,
and I want O'Keefe.

01:29:18.812 --> 01:29:21.055
I want my family.
What's wrong with that?

01:29:23.173 --> 01:29:26.167
- Not the deal we made, baby.
- She's right, Micky.

01:29:26.191 --> 01:29:28.873
- That's not the deal.
- It wasn't the deal.

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:30.782
Come on, you can't do this to us.

01:29:30.805 --> 01:29:32.062
You sound like them now.

01:29:32.073 --> 01:29:33.858
- I sound like them now?
- Yeah, you sound like them.

01:29:33.881 --> 01:29:37.415
- We sound like them?
- You can't do this to us. You can't do this to us.

01:29:37.425 --> 01:29:38.776
You sound like them.

01:29:40.146 --> 01:29:41.954
You should fucking listen to yourself.

01:29:41.967 --> 01:29:44.620
You sound like them, just like them.
Maybe this is where you belong.

01:29:44.632 --> 01:29:47.011
- That's the way you love him?
- Charlene!

01:29:47.034 --> 01:29:50.415
- Come on!
- You want your brother? Good luck.

01:29:50.439 --> 01:29:53.124
- O'Keefe, come on...
- Micky.

01:29:53.136 --> 01:29:54.181
Micky...

01:29:57.263 --> 01:29:59.691
Come on,
everything happens for a reason.

01:30:00.696 --> 01:30:02.540
You know, maybe it's for the best.

01:30:04.054 --> 01:30:05.651
God has a plan.

01:30:08.230 --> 01:30:10.303
Want to spar with your brother?

01:30:16.805 --> 01:30:18.695
Dick Eklund, Pride of Lowell.

01:30:19.999 --> 01:30:22.030
Watching that for years, huh?

01:30:25.676 --> 01:30:28.917
Whoa, hey, what the hell are you doing?

01:30:29.633 --> 01:30:32.440
- Micky, for crying out loud!
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

01:30:32.445 --> 01:30:36.290
Take that baby out of here.
I told you take him away ten minutes ago!

01:30:36.296 --> 01:30:39.079
Sweetheart, are you all right?
You okay? Your back?

01:30:40.458 --> 01:30:43.504
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

01:30:43.516 --> 01:30:45.630
Will it be my fight, Alice? Huh?

01:30:45.641 --> 01:30:49.757
Just once? Maybe just
this one time, not for Dicky?

01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:51.130
Huh?

01:30:51.148 --> 01:30:53.273
I know you think he's coming back,

01:30:53.296 --> 01:30:56.889
but he's forty years old and he doesn't have
a tooth in his head that's his fucking own.

01:30:56.906 --> 01:31:00.276
Let your brother talk
for a minute here, all right?

01:31:00.294 --> 01:31:04.876
- What are you saying, sweetheart?
- Shut up before I bust your fucking head open, Dicky.

01:31:04.888 --> 01:31:07.923
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What are you going to do?

01:31:07.935 --> 01:31:10.995
- You want me to bust your fucking head open?
- Come on! Come on! George!

01:31:11.018 --> 01:31:12.924
- Please! Please!
- Dicky!

01:31:12.946 --> 01:31:15.494
What are you saying, sweetheart?
Tell me what you're saying.

01:31:15.518 --> 01:31:17.432
This is supposed to be my fight.

01:31:17.456 --> 01:31:18.900
- This is my shot at a title.
- It is your fight.

01:31:18.912 --> 01:31:20.180
I won't get another one after this.

01:31:20.204 --> 01:31:22.705
Am I being selfish?
Am I saying "Micky! Micky! Micky!"?

01:31:22.728 --> 01:31:24.694
Because you know what?
If I am, I'm sorry.

01:31:24.708 --> 01:31:28.683
I thought I was fighting for the championship.
And I thought you were my mother, too.

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:31.662
I am your mother.

01:31:36.492 --> 01:31:40.844
Mick, I'm sorry. I had no idea
you felt like that, all right?

01:31:40.868 --> 01:31:43.966
If I made mistakes,
I'm going to be better.

01:31:43.977 --> 01:31:47.793
I don't want to hurt you.
I am so sorry.

01:31:47.817 --> 01:31:49.754
I'm sorry.

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:57.136
Dicky!
Stay with him.

01:31:58.064 --> 01:31:59.590
Dicky!

01:32:01.116 --> 01:32:02.490
Dicky!

01:32:07.386 --> 01:32:09.535
- Dicky!
- Got to do something.

01:32:09.547 --> 01:32:11.449
Dicky, wait. Come on.

01:32:12.388 --> 01:32:14.760
Micky wants you. I want you.

01:32:15.147 --> 01:32:18.765
- I've got to do something.
- I know what that means. Don't do this!

01:32:47.015 --> 01:32:48.894
Hey, Jim.

01:32:53.637 --> 01:32:55.058
- Smart.
- Hey, Dicky.

01:32:57.986 --> 01:33:00.405
- Hey, Dicky's back!
- Yay!

01:33:00.428 --> 01:33:02.095
- Hey!
- Dicky!

01:33:03.308 --> 01:33:05.809
- Look at you!
- Look at my boy, huh?

01:33:05.821 --> 01:33:06.960
Come over here.

01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:08.641
You look good. Welcome back.

01:33:08.655 --> 01:33:11.109
- Yeah, you're looking good.
- You look great.

01:33:11.133 --> 01:33:13.141
Good to see you.

01:33:13.159 --> 01:33:15.894
- Welcome home.
- Hi, honey.

01:33:17.555 --> 01:33:19.422
What's up, man? You're looking good.

01:33:19.425 --> 01:33:21.703
So, want to head up there?

01:33:21.726 --> 01:33:23.123
Dicky's back!

01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:31.362
Go upstairs, take a while, huh?

01:33:39.167 --> 01:33:42.032
- Throw a little party for you, babe.
- Hey, come back!

01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:46.550
- The fuck was that all about?
- What the hell was that?

01:34:01.867 --> 01:34:04.099
Charlene, it's Dicky.

01:34:06.003 --> 01:34:08.600
Get off my porch, you piece of shit.

01:34:10.731 --> 01:34:12.442
How fucking dare you come?

01:34:13.977 --> 01:34:15.960
Cock sucker!

01:34:15.961 --> 01:34:17.147
Fucking boy!

01:34:17.153 --> 01:34:18.139
Fucking ass!

01:34:18.151 --> 01:34:18.961
Fucking sick!

01:34:20.264 --> 01:34:23.292
You're a fucking asshole, Dicky.
I want you off my fucking porch.

01:34:23.315 --> 01:34:27.213
Huh? Why don't you just fucking
come down here and talk to me, huh?

01:34:27.237 --> 01:34:29.159
You're such an asshole,
coming to my fucking house.

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:31.354
- You piece of shit, standing on my porch!
- Sorry, sorry.

01:34:31.379 --> 01:34:34.960
It's not fucking ladylike to be shouting
in the street like this, all right?

01:34:34.972 --> 01:34:37.672
- You're such a fucking cock sucker, coming over here.
- Please!

01:34:37.684 --> 01:34:39.633
- Oh yeah? You think I fucking care?
- Come on. Just fucking...

01:34:39.645 --> 01:34:41.933
Get off my fucking porch, Dicky.

01:34:55.629 --> 01:34:57.985
What kind of dog is that?
Is that a cocker spaniel?

01:35:04.317 --> 01:35:05.937
All right,
I know you can't fucking stand me.

01:35:05.949 --> 01:35:09.296
- Really, what makes you say that?
- I got news for you, all right?

01:35:09.319 --> 01:35:11.046
My brother loves you,

01:35:11.071 --> 01:35:13.478
and you can't just run away because of me.

01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:18.404
You don't deserve that, all right?
So I will quit if you want me to quit.

01:35:18.416 --> 01:35:20.806
- You're full of shit.
- I swear to God.

01:35:20.818 --> 01:35:23.024
I will quit if it means
you'll come back, all right?

01:35:23.048 --> 01:35:24.833
But I want you to
think about something.

01:35:24.848 --> 01:35:27.937
Micky has a chance to do
something that I never did,

01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:30.191
that in my time, I never had.

01:35:30.215 --> 01:35:33.376
Oh... "Yeah, my big chance was with
Sugar Ray Leonard. I'm so great."

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:36.699
"I'm the Pride of fucking Lowell.
Oh yeah, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard."

01:35:36.723 --> 01:35:38.378
- I've heard it.
- I came to make things right with you.

01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:41.347
Okay, let's make things right.
Number one:

01:35:41.359 --> 01:35:43.625
You didn't knock down
Sugar Ray Leonard. He tripped.

01:35:46.071 --> 01:35:50.662
I was in the ring. Don't you think I know
what really fucking happened that day?

01:35:50.677 --> 01:35:53.166
- What have you ever done with your life?
- I like my life.

01:35:53.190 --> 01:35:55.020
- Yeah? What have you ever done with it?
- I like my life now, Dicky.

01:35:55.032 --> 01:35:57.181
What have you ever done with your life?

01:35:57.194 --> 01:36:00.975
You're a college dropout, Charlene.
You're just a little bar girl. Your life sucks.

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:04.085
All right.

01:36:05.277 --> 01:36:08.424
I drink too much.
I worked in a lot of bars.

01:36:08.443 --> 01:36:11.695
And I ruined a lot of opportunities,
but I'm trying to do better here.

01:36:11.719 --> 01:36:13.726
- So is Micky.
- So am I.

01:36:15.756 --> 01:36:20.124
And he needs me, you heard him.
And I know he needs you.

01:36:23.719 --> 01:36:25.691
What is that blue shit on your arm?

01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:28.408
It's icing.

01:36:31.891 --> 01:36:33.554
Okay.

01:36:33.566 --> 01:36:36.231
I'll see you in Micky's corner.
Otherwise, go fuck yourself.

01:36:36.255 --> 01:36:38.355
- It's a deal.
- All right, it's a deal.

01:36:50.721 --> 01:36:52.966
We worked it out for you. Ask her.

01:36:54.702 --> 01:36:57.837
Good. Go get O'Keefe back, too.

01:36:59.425 --> 01:37:00.644
I will.

01:37:06.436 --> 01:37:07.581
Hey, Mick.

01:37:09.872 --> 01:37:12.056
Do you think I knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard?

01:37:13.531 --> 01:37:16.443
You went ten rounds. One of the best
to do anything to hurt him.

01:37:17.418 --> 01:37:18.651
You're my hero.

01:37:19.878 --> 01:37:21.289
I was.

01:37:23.244 --> 01:37:24.606
I was...

01:37:30.049 --> 01:37:33.231
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah?

01:38:51.798 --> 01:38:54.275
There's a press conference downstairs.

01:38:54.276 --> 01:38:56.706
- Come on. Let's go.
- Guys...

01:38:58.181 --> 01:39:02.220
Neary: Ten stone, six pounds.

01:39:08.617 --> 01:39:13.018
Ward: Ten stone, six pounds.

01:39:14.348 --> 01:39:17.213
Hey, Micky. Micky Ward!
We have a question over here.

01:39:19.009 --> 01:39:20.511
How have you been training?

01:39:20.535 --> 01:39:24.010
- I train. I train hard.
- Shea's 22 in 0. Never been knocked down.

01:39:24.033 --> 01:39:25.924
Well that's going to change tomorrow.

01:39:25.935 --> 01:39:28.124
In fact we expected a much better fighter.

01:39:28.861 --> 01:39:32.465
I'm just grateful to be here and have
the opportunity. Thank you, guys, for the shot.

01:39:32.474 --> 01:39:35.081
Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?

01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:37.826
And who would you like to fight next?

01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:40.472
I plan on moving
right through Micky Ward tomorrow,

01:39:40.484 --> 01:39:43.208
moving on to other big fighters,
like Gatti.

01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:45.568
I believe Gatti and I would
make a great match.

01:39:59.652 --> 01:40:02.940
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
twelve rounds of boxing

01:40:02.963 --> 01:40:09.351
for the WBU Welterweight
Championship of the World!

01:40:55.847 --> 01:40:58.183
Don't listen to them, Mick.

01:41:11.204 --> 01:41:14.668
And there is Micky Ward
of Lowell, Massachusetts entering the ring.

01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:17.639
It's his first fight outside the United States.

01:41:17.653 --> 01:41:20.483
Micky Ward, 30 wins, 7 losses...

01:41:20.506 --> 01:41:23.794
He's back and better, recently.
Twenty KOs.

01:41:23.806 --> 01:41:28.378
And now Ward awaits his opponent,
Shea Neary.

01:41:28.393 --> 01:41:33.176
Neary regards himself as
the European Arturo Gatti,

01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:36.464
meaning that he is a head-on
high-contact fighter

01:41:36.476 --> 01:41:40.174
who throws seventy punches per round.

01:41:40.192 --> 01:41:44.254
Neary is from Liverpool and should
have a huge following her tonight.

01:41:46.157 --> 01:41:50.463
Accompanied by "Paint the Town Red"
by the Mahones.

01:41:50.482 --> 01:41:53.904
Neary is the current
Welterweight Champion of the World.

01:41:53.928 --> 01:41:59.888
He is a very tough young man.
Beyond dedicated. Lives a spartan existence.

01:41:59.889 --> 01:42:05.195
And according to his promoters,
there's nothing but eat, drink, think,

01:42:05.206 --> 01:42:09.069
fantasize and dream of fighting.

01:42:09.093 --> 01:42:12.694
Shea Neary has had 22 professional fights
and won them all.

01:42:12.695 --> 01:42:15.256
Seventeen KOs.

01:42:24.989 --> 01:42:28.434
Start when you hear the bell.
Shake hands.

01:42:29.052 --> 01:42:32.023
Both of you. Shake hands.

01:42:33.211 --> 01:42:38.963
As close as we just saw them in the middle
of the ring, forehead to forehead.

01:42:38.964 --> 01:42:45.451
That's how close we expect them to be
for as long as this fight goes on.

01:42:45.472 --> 01:42:49.499
Ward is a long ways from home.
Don't coast in a foreign country.

01:42:49.522 --> 01:42:54.453
Well the big challenge for Ward is to get off
to a faster start than is customary for him.

01:42:54.454 --> 01:42:58.003
Micky Ward a notoriously slow starter
in big fights.

01:42:58.013 --> 01:43:00.502
Shea Neary an ultra-fast starter.

01:43:00.517 --> 01:43:04.941
And that's the question that hovers
over round one. Get ready for the fight.

01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:07.954
Already Shea Neary starts
taking it to him on the ropes.

01:43:07.978 --> 01:43:11.501
And Neary going to the body,
which is Ward's specialty.

01:43:12.041 --> 01:43:14.988
- Whoa!
- Neary bangs Ward to the body.

01:43:15.012 --> 01:43:19.133
- And a big uppercut by Neary.
- Neary leads off with a good left jab.

01:43:19.139 --> 01:43:22.767
Keeps opponents off balance,
jabbing here and there.

01:43:25.098 --> 01:43:28.779
That was a good left hook by Neary
as he stepped in on Ward.

01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:33.639
Ward not able to deal with him very well
when Neary stands at range like this.

01:43:33.650 --> 01:43:36.327
- Come on!
- That's it! Get him!

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.790
My, is it tough for Micky Ward.

01:43:39.808 --> 01:43:45.142
Neary digging his own right hand to the body.
They trade shots at close range.

01:43:45.166 --> 01:43:48.009
Ward is trying to match Neary blow-for-blow,

01:43:48.033 --> 01:43:53.033
and now Neary starts to come on
and take the last thirty seconds to the round.

01:43:53.046 --> 01:43:55.476
- How about that!
- Break!

01:43:56.884 --> 01:44:01.545
Tremendous barrage in the first minute.
Just look at this. Unbelievable.

01:44:01.557 --> 01:44:04.050
What a great round one!

01:44:04.074 --> 01:44:08.150
Ward is going to have to
pick up the tempo

01:44:08.162 --> 01:44:10.052
and beat him with volumes of punching.

01:44:10.058 --> 01:44:12.406
No doubt Neary is a better boxer.

01:44:15.521 --> 01:44:20.629
Four hard right hands
Neary has belted in the last minute.

01:44:20.639 --> 01:44:25.617
Quicker than Ward, more assertive than Ward.
Surer of what he wants to do.

01:44:25.628 --> 01:44:28.794
They're standing and trading shots
at the center of the ring.

01:44:28.806 --> 01:44:31.872
Ward's going to have to step it up
a little bit more than he is right now.

01:44:31.889 --> 01:44:35.435
Micky Ward's corner taking
a really deep look at what's going on now,

01:44:35.458 --> 01:44:38.664
and his family at ringside
well aware he's stepping up in class.

01:44:38.681 --> 01:44:42.464
Ward has to got to be more aggressive.

01:44:42.474 --> 01:44:45.173
He can't just try to wait until
everything is perfect.

01:44:45.185 --> 01:44:47.815
Despondence over Micky Ward
is increasing as the fight goes on

01:44:47.829 --> 01:44:51.949
because his plan was the right one
and he's executing it.

01:44:51.968 --> 01:44:59.236
Punches like these make it seem
that it's now Neary's fight.

01:45:00.686 --> 01:45:05.982
Ward hasn't been in this kind of war
with as strong a fighter as Neary.

01:45:07.467 --> 01:45:11.032
They are trying to hurt each other
with only punches.

01:45:11.039 --> 01:45:15.807
They've tested each other's will,
now they're testing each other's skill.

01:45:15.818 --> 01:45:19.258
And Ward fumbled there
by a right cross from Neary.

01:45:19.269 --> 01:45:25.651
- Ward hurting now, his legs are gone.
- Neary goes to the body as he tries to finish Micky.

01:45:26.466 --> 01:45:32.301
- Vicious body shots from Neary.
- And Ward doesn't even try to move off the ropes.

01:45:32.313 --> 01:45:37.280
I don't know if he can, Jeff.
He's waiting for Neary to punch himself out.

01:45:37.281 --> 01:45:41.562
Down goes Micky Ward, and he may be out.

01:45:43.268 --> 01:45:44.929
Come on, that's it!

01:45:45.792 --> 01:45:47.530
That's my boy!

01:45:47.535 --> 01:45:50.459
Forward! Forward!
Come on!

01:45:51.978 --> 01:45:56.735
- Ward is out on his feet!
- Loser! Go back to America!

01:45:56.746 --> 01:45:58.879
This could be it for Micky Ward.

01:45:58.902 --> 01:46:01.555
Dicky, get him a fucking stool
Where's the stool?

01:46:01.567 --> 01:46:04.223
Charlene, will you get the fuck
out of here with your high heels?

01:46:05.142 --> 01:46:09.770
His brother's got Ward jumping
to wake up his legs.

01:46:09.782 --> 01:46:13.256
I think this could be Ward's last chance
to turn this fight around.

01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:18.100
It's Micky Ward against the aggressiveness
and clean punching of Shea Neary.

01:46:19.037 --> 01:46:22.430
If you don't have your defense up
you can really get hurt.

01:46:22.454 --> 01:46:25.160
He's making it very difficult for Micky Ward.

01:46:25.172 --> 01:46:27.966
I don't think he's going to give it to him,
at this rate.

01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:30.009
This is a survival move.

01:46:30.031 --> 01:46:33.753
Are you like me? Huh?
Just good enough to fight Sugar Ray?

01:46:33.777 --> 01:46:37.293
I never had to win, did I?
You've got to do more than that.

01:46:37.316 --> 01:46:42.447
You've got to win a title.
For you, for me, for Lowell.

01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:44.948
This is your time, all right?
You take it.

01:46:44.972 --> 01:46:47.865
I had my time, and I blew it.
You don't have to, all right?

01:46:47.934 --> 01:46:51.649
Now fucking get out there.
Bring that fucking anger.

01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:54.290
All the shit you've been through
over the fucking years,

01:46:54.307 --> 01:46:56.935
put it in the ring right now.
This is yours. This is fucking yours.

01:46:57.010 --> 01:46:59.860
- Okay.
- Fucking head, body, head, body.

01:46:59.884 --> 01:47:03.371
- Say it back to me.
- Head, body, head, body.

01:47:03.389 --> 01:47:07.278
You can do it.
Stay off the fucking ropes.

01:47:11.972 --> 01:47:14.238
If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,

01:47:14.250 --> 01:47:17.807
I'm thinking if he doesn't pick things up
this round and get going,

01:47:17.824 --> 01:47:22.005
he'll just get totally wiped out.

01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:24.487
Get off the ropes!
Get off the ropes, Mick!

01:47:25.075 --> 01:47:28.797
Once again, Ward against the ropes
as Neary is free to attack.

01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:31.200
What are you doing?
Come on, Mick...

01:47:31.818 --> 01:47:35.538
Sometimes if you want to win,
you've got to be something that you're not.

01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:39.211
Off the fucking rope, man!
That ain't it!

01:47:39.655 --> 01:47:42.254
Neary continues to pound away.

01:47:44.566 --> 01:47:48.592
Don't take no abuse!
This is your time, Micky!

01:47:48.594 --> 01:47:50.586
It's all for you!

01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:52.857
- Two big misses by Neary.
- That's it! That's it!

01:47:52.867 --> 01:47:56.718
Ward seemingly getting his legs back.

01:47:56.742 --> 01:48:00.957
Now he backs Neary up.
Ward trades his way back.

01:48:00.974 --> 01:48:04.020
Ward nods as if to say "Come on!".

01:48:04.021 --> 01:48:06.592
"Come on, let's fight!"

01:48:06.613 --> 01:48:09.986
Closer and closer to Neary's ribcage.

01:48:10.009 --> 01:48:12.604
This is becoming Micky Ward's fight.

01:48:12.616 --> 01:48:15.246
And a left hook to the body,
and an uppercut lands,

01:48:15.257 --> 01:48:17.970
and now he backs Neary up.

01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:20.973
Ward hits Neary with a body shot.

01:48:20.984 --> 01:48:23.731
Four left hooks in the body.

01:48:25.835 --> 01:48:29.710
Neary on his butt,
first time in 23 professional fights

01:48:29.721 --> 01:48:33.343
that Shea Neary has gone down.

01:48:33.351 --> 01:48:35.782
This is it! This is it, Micky!

01:48:35.794 --> 01:48:41.012
23 seconds remain in this round
as Micky now wipes off Neary's gloves.

01:48:43.530 --> 01:48:49.634
Ward lands a huge left hook
as Micky Ward works away.

01:48:49.635 --> 01:48:53.463
Blows to the body with the left hook.
There's the uppercut again!

01:48:55.528 --> 01:48:57.788
Gonna stop it right there.

01:48:57.811 --> 01:49:02.825
"Irish" Micky Ward with a big
eighth-round TKO!

01:49:02.833 --> 01:49:06.806
He's done it again.
He's done it again.

01:49:06.817 --> 01:49:11.943
They grinding gutting Micky Ward
pulls out another big victory.

01:49:24.691 --> 01:49:28.938
You're the champion of the world, Mick!
You're the fucking champion of the world!

01:49:28.956 --> 01:49:31.434
You fucking did it!

01:49:44.196 --> 01:49:47.214
My boy's the champion of the world!

01:49:47.215 --> 01:49:49.280
I love you!

01:50:19.454 --> 01:50:23.035
This town always said
you're a fucking boxer, right?

01:50:23.059 --> 01:50:25.424
You thought it's a piece of shit.

01:50:25.436 --> 01:50:27.761
- He put Lowell back on the map, you know.
- We did.

01:50:27.772 --> 01:50:30.802
- I tell you. No, hold on.
- We.

01:50:30.818 --> 01:50:33.954
Who used to be the Pride of Lowell?
Right here.

01:50:33.956 --> 01:50:36.562
Who's the Pride of Lowell now?
Right there.

01:50:36.563 --> 01:50:38.641
That's how it's meant to be, you know?

01:50:38.647 --> 01:50:41.782
Hand it down to him.
Nothing better than that.

01:50:41.794 --> 01:50:44.057
Nothing better than that...

01:50:44.058 --> 01:50:46.228
He did it.
I've got to go.

01:50:46.252 --> 01:50:47.813
I've got to go.

Oh, Boo Boo. Quacker!

01:51:19.928 --> 01:51:22.687
- Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack!
- Boo Boo...

01:51:22.705 --> 01:51:24.783
Boo, where's your teeth?
