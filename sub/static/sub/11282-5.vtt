CHRIS ROCK:
When I became
football team manager,

00:05.139 --> 00:06.807
I learned
the first rule of sports:

00:06.840 --> 00:07.975
When they're not playing,

00:08.008 --> 00:11.212
athletes expect other people
to do things for them.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.181
They expected you
to do easy things.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.816
Hey, Chris.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.452
Hit that pedal for me.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.624
Ah, thanks, man.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.459
I got any water
on my face?

00:25.493 --> 00:28.129
They expected you
to do hard things.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.631
Hey, Chris, put this back
in the weight room for me.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.502
They expected you
to do ridiculous things.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.170
Hey, Chris, could you
eat this for me?

00:36.204 --> 00:38.439
I don't like it.

00:38.472 --> 00:41.109
But mostly, they expected you
to do things they couldn'tdo.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.344
Hey, Chris, I need
to talk to you, man.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.312
What's up?

00:44.345 --> 00:47.648
What's up is
Coach Thurman's gonna fail me.

00:47.681 --> 00:50.518
Fail you? You're, like,
the best guy on the team.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.487
All you have to do is show up
and it's automatic "A."

00:53.521 --> 00:56.324
Why would he fail you?
Something about me never
showing up to class.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.725
Look, he's trippin'.

00:57.758 --> 01:01.529
I don't know why we need
to learn about history anyway.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.665
What difference does it make
who won World War III?

01:04.698 --> 01:06.200
It's over.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.401
The Japanese won,

01:07.435 --> 01:08.636
and now we
have Walkmans.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.638
Thank God Italy
won World War IV

01:10.671 --> 01:12.240
and we got pizza.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.607
So, what you gonna
do about it?

01:13.641 --> 01:15.576
It's not what I'm
gonna do about it,

01:15.609 --> 01:17.545
it's what you're
gonna do about it.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.580
I need you
to do my history
assignments for me.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.748
Man, this is a lot of work.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.683
Come on, man, I
thought we were cool.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.418
What am I gonna get out of it?

01:24.452 --> 01:25.753
I'll owe you one.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.888
You will?
Yeah.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.323
Even though
doing Dickerson's work

01:29.357 --> 01:30.591
was like taking an extra class,

01:30.624 --> 01:33.294
I knew him owing me one
would be worth it.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.528
All right, I'll do it.

01:34.562 --> 01:35.729
* Pump up the volume,
pump up the volume *

01:35.763 --> 01:36.730
My man.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.332
* Dance, dance...

01:50.744 --> 01:52.913
* Ah, make it funky now.

01:52.946 --> 01:57.151

02:11.565 --> 02:13.501
When Dickerson said "my man,"

02:13.534 --> 02:15.469
it was like making me
vice president.

02:15.503 --> 02:18.472
It was the next best thing
to being him.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.574
What's this?
It's your homework.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.443
GIRL:
Hi, Dickerson.
I summarized
chapter three.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.877
BOY:
Dickerson!
It starts with
the Magna Carta

02:23.911 --> 02:25.713
and how it affected the
serfs in rural England.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.581
GIRL:
Hey.
My man!

02:27.615 --> 02:29.617
That's it?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.252
That's what?

02:31.285 --> 02:32.620
I had expected a little more.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.455
I thought by being cool
with Dickerson,

02:34.488 --> 02:36.590
a whole new world
would open up...

02:36.624 --> 02:39.793
in school...
That'll be
a dollar.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.563
Whoa, whoa.
His lunch is free.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.366
That's my man.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.534
...after class...

02:46.567 --> 02:47.835
Give him your number.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.970
That's my man.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.807
...even in the streets.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.743
What do we have here?

02:55.776 --> 02:57.545
Aw, look at that.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.647
Hey, hey, don't arrest him.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.315
That's my man.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.683
Oh, my bad.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.984
Excuse me.
Sorry.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.387
There you go.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.688
You got it.
No problem.

03:07.721 --> 03:08.756
Good to
see you.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.560
Yo. You're just gonna
knock my man's stuff

03:12.593 --> 03:14.828
out of his hand
and not pick it up?

03:14.862 --> 03:15.996
Sorry.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.766
Caruso knows how
to say "sorry"?

03:22.970 --> 03:25.639
Anyway, what'd you want?

03:25.673 --> 03:26.940
Nothing.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.342
My man.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.612
Back at home,
I wasn't the only one

03:31.645 --> 03:33.581
who needed
a new man on the job.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.716
Oh! Excuse me, Mr. Julius.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.951
Exactly the man
I was looking for.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.387
Is everything all right?

03:39.420 --> 03:41.289
Actually, I got
a bit of a situation.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.657
You wouldn't know anyone
looking for a job, would you?

03:44.625 --> 03:46.360
Me! Me!

03:46.394 --> 03:47.628
I want a job! Me!

03:47.661 --> 03:48.996
Whoo!

03:49.029 --> 03:50.631
I want a... Me!

03:50.664 --> 03:52.266
What kind of job?

03:52.300 --> 03:54.468
I mean, I might
be interested.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.036
If my father had been a rapper,

03:56.069 --> 03:57.971
his name would've been
Snoop Jobby-Job.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.607
Don't you already have two jobs?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.275
:
You want another one?

04:01.309 --> 04:02.543
That's like
asking Amy Winehouse

04:02.576 --> 04:04.011
if she wants another drink?

04:04.044 --> 04:05.413
Well, what's the job?

04:05.446 --> 04:07.581
Well, my assistant died today.

04:07.615 --> 04:08.982
Oh, no. What happened?

04:09.016 --> 04:10.984
Well, he went
to a dollar theater

04:11.018 --> 04:13.554
to watch the movie Airplane,
when ironically,

04:13.587 --> 04:16.690
a chemical toilet
fell out of an airplane,

04:16.724 --> 04:18.826
crashed through the roof
and crushed him.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.394
Tragic.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.829
Tragic!

04:21.862 --> 04:24.365
Anyway, I need a replacement.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.666
What would I have to do?

04:25.699 --> 04:28.436
Well... you know,
pickups, deliveries.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.070
That's what I already do.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.473
Well, all right, then,
you're hired!

04:33.774 --> 04:35.543
Uh, here you go.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.645
Now, the van's out front.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.046
What's this?

04:39.079 --> 04:40.714
Oh, the address to the theater.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.683
I need you to pick up
my dead assistant,

04:42.716 --> 04:44.518
row J, seat 15.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.619
And I believe

04:45.653 --> 04:46.654
he's entitled to a refund,

04:46.687 --> 04:49.890
so you keep that
as a signing bonus.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.626
With a new job
and a signing bonus,

04:52.660 --> 04:55.095
my father thought he had
been hit by a chemical toilet

04:55.128 --> 04:56.730
and gone to Heaven.

04:56.764 --> 04:59.066
Meanwhile, doing Dickerson's
work was killing me.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.802
Yo, Chris.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.071
You didn't finish that homework?

05:04.104 --> 05:06.640
Oh, yeah-- this is my homework.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.509
I did yours last night.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.577
There.

05:09.610 --> 05:12.513
It's a complete time line
of the significant events

05:12.546 --> 05:14.615
that led up
to World War I.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.849
My man!

05:15.883 --> 05:19.587
Hey, get me a sandwich--
turkey with, uh,

05:19.620 --> 05:20.988
cheese and
mayo on it.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.790
They don't have that today.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.758
They got it across the street.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.527
Cool.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.496
:
My man!

05:28.529 --> 05:30.898
Hey, Walter.
Hey, Carol.
You hungry?

05:30.931 --> 05:32.900
My man was just about
to get me a sandwich.

05:32.933 --> 05:33.901
I'll take one.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.803
Make that two.

05:35.836 --> 05:36.904
Cool.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.772
:
My man!

05:38.806 --> 05:41.742
Dude, just then,
am I crazy,

05:41.775 --> 05:44.478
or when Dickerson
said "my man" was
he talking to you?

05:44.512 --> 05:45.779
Yeah, he was talking to me.

05:45.813 --> 05:46.847
That's awesome!

05:46.880 --> 05:48.549
You're, like, his
number-two guy now.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.584
It's like Chico and the Man,

05:50.618 --> 05:51.885
My Man Godfrey,
Our Man Flint.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.021
I can't even imagine--
the perks gotta be great.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.823
Well, so far
the only perk is

05:55.856 --> 05:58.392
Caruso saw me earlier
and didn't punch me
in the face.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.160
What's up, Parish?
Hey, Bird.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.129
So, what's up
with you and Dickerson?

06:02.162 --> 06:03.163
You guys hanging out?

06:03.196 --> 06:04.698
That's your man?
You're cool?

06:04.732 --> 06:05.733
Basically, yeah.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.401
Huh. What about you,

06:07.435 --> 06:08.969
are you cool
with Dickerson, too?

06:09.002 --> 06:10.538
Nah, just him.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.005
Cool.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.508
Greg did a nice job
of waiting ten seconds

06:14.542 --> 06:16.009
before crying.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.145
After a full day
of hanging with Dickerson,

06:18.178 --> 06:20.681
I was hung up at home, too.
Boy, put that away.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.484
You got that much
work, you have to do
it during dinner?

06:23.517 --> 06:25.886
I have a lot this week--
I was up late last night.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.588
I'm just trying
to get it done.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.531
Hey, baby!

06:39.633 --> 06:40.734
What's up, Chris?

06:40.768 --> 06:42.436
Drew.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.837
Pssh!

06:43.871 --> 06:45.038
Baby girl.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.206
Hey.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.842
This smells good!

06:48.876 --> 06:50.511
Whew!

06:51.879 --> 06:54.848
Rochelle, did you do
something new with your hair?

06:54.882 --> 06:57.017
I combed it.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.752
It looks great.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.721
Doesn't your mother's hair
look great?

07:01.989 --> 07:03.491
CHRIS/TONYA/DREW:
I don't know.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.593
Well, I think it looks great.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.561
TONYA:
Can I get finger waves
in my hair?

07:07.595 --> 07:08.862
You got finger wave money?

07:08.896 --> 07:10.498
Uh, I could give
her finger waves.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.165
All you need is a
perm kit, holding gel,

07:12.199 --> 07:13.200
some gloves
and your fingers.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.868
I don't think so, baby.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.504
I'll give you ten dollars
if you need it.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.871
You been drinking?

07:17.905 --> 07:19.707
No. I just feel good today.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.576
Dad, you said you'd just
pay for finger waves.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.777
Did you get knocked

07:23.811 --> 07:25.879
over your head
and forget you were broke?

07:25.913 --> 07:27.014
No.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.783
Did aliens kidnap you and
replace you with a rich guy?

07:29.817 --> 07:31.485
No.
Can I get new earrings?

07:31.519 --> 07:32.753
Sure.

07:33.854 --> 07:34.855
What's going on with you?

07:34.888 --> 07:36.123
What are you talking about?

07:36.156 --> 07:37.224
You're singing
and dancing

07:37.257 --> 07:38.726
and willing to pay

07:38.759 --> 07:40.494
for finger waves
and earrings?

07:40.528 --> 07:41.795
Are you leaving us
for a white woman?

07:41.829 --> 07:44.632
No. It's just being
at this new job,

07:44.665 --> 07:46.800
I'm with dead people
everywhere I go.

07:46.834 --> 07:50.604
It just makes me feel
like I need to appreciate
life a little more.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.072
Oh, this is good!

07:52.105 --> 07:53.541
What is this, baby?

07:53.574 --> 07:55.709
Vegetables.

07:55.743 --> 07:56.910
You kids try this?

07:56.944 --> 07:59.112
Chris, pass me
the big piece of carrot.

07:59.146 --> 08:02.716
I don't know how you
can stand being around
all those dead people.

08:02.750 --> 08:03.851
I love it.

08:03.884 --> 08:06.654
It makes you realize
that life is short.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.689
Anything can happen
at any time--

08:08.722 --> 08:09.857
a toilet could fall
out of the sky and crush you.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.158
A bus door

08:11.191 --> 08:13.561
could clamp on your
neck and choke you.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.830
A poisonous lizard
could escape from
the zoo and bite you.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.032
You could fall off a bridge
and drown.

08:19.066 --> 08:23.804
And you could trip and
fall in front of a power
mower and be decapitated.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.238
You could be smoking
a cigarette

08:25.272 --> 08:26.674
and blow up while siphoning

08:26.707 --> 08:28.175
:
65 cents' worth of gas.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.844
And you could eat some
bad coleslaw and get diarrhea

08:30.878 --> 08:32.646
and die of dehydration.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.847
You could step in a puddle

08:33.881 --> 08:35.683
and be electrocuted
by a downed wire.

08:35.716 --> 08:38.018
You could blow your nose
and startle a cat with rabies...

08:38.051 --> 08:40.688
Okay, okay, we get it!

08:40.721 --> 08:42.723
We can die at any time,

08:42.756 --> 08:44.291
and you're happy!
That's right.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.793
Ma, can I go?

08:45.826 --> 08:46.894
I got to get to school.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.562
Hold on.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.964
Since I'm happy, I want
you all to be happy.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.000
I bought you all
some presents.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.001
You did what?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.904
Drew, I got you a Kangol hat.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.005
Ah, cool.

08:58.038 --> 08:58.939
ROCHELLE:
Wait, wait, wait.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.174
That thing is expensive.
Tonya,

09:01.208 --> 09:04.077
I got you a Danny Glover
Witness Action Play Set.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.180
You bought
your daughter

09:07.214 --> 09:08.616
a gun?

09:08.649 --> 09:09.617
It's just like the one

09:09.650 --> 09:11.251
he wounded Harrison Ford with--
thanks, Daddy!

09:11.284 --> 09:13.921
They were out of
The Color Purple Play Set.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.123
Chris, I got you

09:16.156 --> 09:18.258
the heavy-duty garbage bag
with the quick ties

09:18.291 --> 09:21.161
so they won't break
when you carry a heavy load.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.896
Ah. 13-gallon.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.965
I was wondering
how you were gonna top

09:24.998 --> 09:26.700
the Danny Glover thing.
Julius, we have

09:26.734 --> 09:28.669
bills to pay,
and you're giving out gifts?

09:28.702 --> 09:30.638
What about the present
to the gas company,

09:30.671 --> 09:31.705
the electric company,

09:31.739 --> 09:33.173
the water company?

09:33.206 --> 09:34.307
This is...

09:34.341 --> 09:38.746
$47.92 that you just spent
on the kids!

09:38.779 --> 09:41.715
Should my garbage bags
really count in that total?

09:41.749 --> 09:43.016
Not just for the kids.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.719
This is for you!

09:45.753 --> 09:48.622
Oh! That's Armando Vermani!

09:48.656 --> 09:50.624
I love Armando
Vermani!

09:50.658 --> 09:51.859
It's all leather!

09:51.892 --> 09:55.228
Oh, baby, this is beautiful!

09:55.262 --> 09:57.665
I thought you were mad
because he was spending money.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.700
Girl, shut up
and go play with your gun.

09:59.733 --> 10:02.135
Oh, I got to put
this in plastic!

10:02.169 --> 10:04.838
I wasn't happy about
what I was getting at home,

10:04.872 --> 10:08.141
and I was even less happy about
what was happening at school.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.143
What?!
I knew this was
gonna happen.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.746
Did you hear
what she said?
Who

10:12.780 --> 10:14.147
We have a test tomorrow--

10:14.181 --> 10:16.717
she went over all the
stuff today in class.
We do?

10:16.750 --> 10:18.018
Dude, you're burning
the candle at both ends.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.687
There's no way you can do
another guy's work

10:19.720 --> 10:20.988
and still have time
for your own stuff.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.723
It's like cheating
on a girlfriend.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.024
If you've never had
a girlfriend.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.358
I'm fine.
Dude, you're not fine.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.094
Unless you want to
fail your classes,

10:27.127 --> 10:29.429
you better tell Dickerson you're
not doing any more of his work.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.032
Just calm down--
I-I can handle this.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.166
Yeah, right after
you finish your nap?

10:33.200 --> 10:37.237
I miss being able to nap
in the middle of the day.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.111
CHRIS ROCK:
So far, all I had gotten
from doing Dickerson's work

10:44.144 --> 10:45.746
was drool on my shirt.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.681
I didn't know if things
would get any better,

10:47.715 --> 10:50.050
so I decided to get out
before things got worse.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.885
Dickerson, I need
to talk to you.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.053
Yo. I need to talk to you.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.288
Thurman pulled out
the big guns.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.024
He said I need
to turn in an essay

10:57.057 --> 10:58.191
on the aftermath of World War I.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.193
And if I don't pull
at least a "B,"

11:00.227 --> 11:02.362
yo, I won't play
in the next game.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.997
An essay?

11:04.031 --> 11:06.066
Yeah. You know,
like, 20-25 pages.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.701
You can do that, right?

11:07.735 --> 11:09.436
Yeah. That's what
I wanted to talk
to you about.

11:09.469 --> 11:12.072
Dickerson, listen
Look, I...

11:12.105 --> 11:14.207
Hi, Walter.
Hey, Chris.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.376
Hey... Carol.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.813
Uh, she's Carol.
I'm Carole with an "e."

11:19.847 --> 11:21.248
A lot of people
make that mistake.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.983
Oh. You didn't tell me
you had a sister.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.051
I don't.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.953
You're not twins?

11:25.986 --> 11:27.487
No.
Why?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.056
You're joking.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.457
Now, why would
they joke about that?

11:30.490 --> 11:32.125
They look exactly alike.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.060
Hmm. You think so?

11:33.093 --> 11:34.394
Man, you need glasses.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.729
CAROL:
We were wondering

11:35.763 --> 11:37.164
if you could
do us a favor.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.431
:
Of course he can
do you a favor.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.033
Look, this is my man.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.002
Chris, you wouldn't leave
my girls hanging, would you?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.470
No.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.404
Great. Here.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.139
What's this?
Just some math.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.140
It's easy.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.408
Then why don't you do it?

11:48.441 --> 11:50.143
Hey, well, look,
we're getting ready to go

11:50.177 --> 11:51.144
eat lunch, my man.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.145
You want to come?

11:52.179 --> 11:53.413
Finally!
Yeah.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.448
:
Psyche!

11:55.482 --> 11:57.084
Man, you ain't
got time to eat,

11:57.117 --> 11:58.852
'cause you got to work,
but that was funny.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.120
We'll catch you
later, all right?

12:00.153 --> 12:01.121
Yeah.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.455
My man.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.457
At school,
things were getting ugly,

12:04.491 --> 12:06.794
but to my father,
life was beautiful.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.028
I don't know
what's got into you,

12:08.061 --> 12:09.529
but I hope
it don't get out.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.132
You know, James,
life is short.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.534
I mean, one day, you could pick
your toenail and...

12:14.567 --> 12:16.770
End up with a bad
viral infection

12:16.804 --> 12:18.038
and have to get your
foot amputated.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.207
We got it.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.341
Look, before you get
to the next scenario,

12:21.374 --> 12:23.110
can I get that cash?
Oh.

12:23.143 --> 12:27.881
Let's see...
$175 right there.

12:27.915 --> 12:28.882
Yeah.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.250
$175?

12:30.283 --> 12:32.252
What you gonna do
with all that?

12:32.285 --> 12:33.821
I'm starting an
answering service.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.189
All I have to do is
buy a couple of phones,

12:36.223 --> 12:38.325
get some extra phone lines,
then I can make money

12:38.358 --> 12:39.993
just by taking other
people's phone calls.

12:40.027 --> 12:42.195
So it's like a human
answering machine.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.264
Exactly.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.800
You know, Julius,
I've been kind of depressed

12:46.834 --> 12:48.168
since my father left us.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.436
Can I get $20?

12:49.469 --> 12:52.305
Sure. Here you go.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.941
My man.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.008
All right.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.309
Mmm.

12:56.343 --> 12:59.046
Back at school, I went from
running around for Dickerson,

12:59.079 --> 13:00.480
to running
around for everybody.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.149
Hey, Chris.
Hey.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.484
Dickerson said you could
do my algebra homework.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.190
Hey, Chris!

13:10.223 --> 13:13.326
Dickerson said you'd
wash my car for me.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.130
Are you Christopher?

13:17.164 --> 13:18.398
Yeah.

13:18.431 --> 13:22.002
Dickerson said you can get the
devil out of this little girl.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.274
While I had it hard,

13:27.307 --> 13:29.476
my father became a soft touch.

13:29.509 --> 13:30.911
Hey, I need $10 for gas.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.145
Regular or premium?

13:32.179 --> 13:33.113
Premium.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.882
There you go.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.884
:
My man.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.852
I need to get my
hair dryer fixed.

13:38.886 --> 13:41.221
Just buy yourself a new one.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.489
Ooh!

13:45.058 --> 13:47.260
I need some ammo for my bazooka.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.096
Anti

13:49.129 --> 13:51.131
Anti-tank, of course.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.532
Oh, here you go.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.434
Thank you.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.369
Can you let me hold
some bail money?

13:56.403 --> 13:59.106
Get yourself a lawyer, too.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.241
Come on.
I didn't do nothing.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.277
You're throwing money away.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.946
No, I'm not, baby.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.347
I'm spreading happiness.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.050
That's the only real thing
you can do with life.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.618
Who knows how much time
we have left?

14:11.651 --> 14:13.220
I do!

14:13.253 --> 14:16.456
We've got 18 years left
to pay off this house.

14:16.489 --> 14:19.026
Three kids left to
put through school.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.995
14 days left to pay off
last month's gas bill.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.296
And you got one more bounce

14:23.330 --> 14:25.098
before I shove that
ball down your throat.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.134
That's my point, Rochelle.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.435
I could be dead
before my threesies.

14:28.468 --> 14:32.272
Julius, you have got
to quit this job.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.473
I don't want to quit this job.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.607
I want to be happy.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.277
You want to be happy.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.112
Okay, one question:
Do you want to be happy

14:39.146 --> 14:40.313
or do you want
to be married?

14:40.347 --> 14:42.115
Why can't you have both?

14:42.149 --> 14:44.217
Just kidding.

14:46.686 --> 14:50.290
My dad wasn't the only one
who had to pay the piper.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.127
I got an "A."
What did you get?

14:54.161 --> 14:55.362
Wow an "F."

14:55.395 --> 14:57.130
You think that stands
for "fantastic?"

14:57.164 --> 14:59.299
You could've just
said, "I hate to say
I told you so."

14:59.332 --> 15:00.500
I told you so.

15:00.533 --> 15:04.371
If smacking Greg is wrong,
I don't want to be right.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.143
CHRIS ROCK:
After getting an "F,"

15:10.177 --> 15:12.245
no matter
what Dickerson said,

15:12.279 --> 15:14.914
I knew it was
time to be my own man.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.684
My man.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.352
Hey, look, I
need you to do me

15:19.386 --> 15:21.354
one of those summaries
again for my English class.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.190
Dickerson,
I can't do this anymore.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.358
I'm sorry.
What are you talking about?

15:25.392 --> 15:27.327
I've been spending so much time
on your work,

15:27.360 --> 15:28.328
I don't have time to do my work.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.397
What are you trying to say?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.165
I'm saying I've been spending
so much time on your work,

15:32.199 --> 15:33.233
I don't have time to do my work.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.135
But I thought you was my man.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.069
I was.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.205
Hey, Dickerson,
he's not your man anymore?

15:38.238 --> 15:40.140
DICKERSON:
No. I guess not.

15:50.017 --> 15:53.053
I can't believe you came down
here after our conversation.

15:53.086 --> 15:56.123
Rochelle, I know you're
concerned right now,

15:56.156 --> 15:57.057
but if you
knew how I felt,

15:57.090 --> 15:58.658
you'd want me to keep
feeling this way.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.427
OMAR:
Oh, hey, Ms. Rochelle.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.430
Here's the address,
Mr. Julius.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.299
Oh, by the say is it possible
to borrow $40?

16:06.333 --> 16:07.634
Sure.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.270
I'll pay you back
next week.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.438
Don't worry about it.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.173
My man.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.541
Bye, baby.
Bye, baby.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.775
Have a good day.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.344
Good man.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.012
You got to fire him,

16:19.046 --> 16:20.280
and you have to
fire him today.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.614
Why would I want to do that?

16:21.648 --> 16:24.284
I've never seen a man
be so happy with his work.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.254
He is throwing money away
like there's no tomorrow.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.089
Well, there might not be
a tomorrow.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.524
Well, if there is, you ain't
gonna have no place to live.

16:31.558 --> 16:32.359
What you talking about?

16:32.392 --> 16:33.560
Let me remind you

16:33.593 --> 16:35.128
you're a tenant
in our house.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.696
If we lose the home,
you lose your...

16:36.729 --> 16:37.697
He's fired.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.332
Thank you.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.401
If you're keeping score,
that's happy: zero,

16:41.434 --> 16:43.370
my mother: one.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.439
Helping out Dickerson
was a bad idea,

16:46.473 --> 16:48.641
and when I stopped,
it got even worse.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.243
You wanted to see me?

16:50.277 --> 16:52.279
Oh, yes. Yeah.

16:52.312 --> 16:56.116
I have here Mr. Dickerson's
essay, in which he received

16:56.149 --> 16:58.418
a grade of "B."

16:58.451 --> 17:02.322
But I'm not so sure
he actually wrote this paper.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.323
Why not?

17:05.225 --> 17:08.695
Walter, who was in
World War One?

17:08.728 --> 17:13.500
Um... Earth and Jupiter.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.468
Now you see
why I'm not sure?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.371
Maybe he forgot.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.473
Forgot Forgot what?

17:20.507 --> 17:22.442
Forgot who was in World War One,

17:22.475 --> 17:27.347
or forgot to not sign
your name on his paper, hmm?

17:27.380 --> 17:31.418
Or not do the whole thing
in your handwriting?

17:31.451 --> 17:33.653
The two of you, huh?

17:33.686 --> 17:35.555
You insult
my intelligence.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.391
Maybe if I was blind,
you could turn this paper in

17:38.425 --> 17:40.127
and say that he wrote it,

17:40.160 --> 17:42.529
but I'm not blind. Hmm?

17:42.562 --> 17:44.497
Do I look blind

17:44.531 --> 17:47.767
Do I have black sunglasses
and a piano?!

17:47.800 --> 17:49.536
Actually, he did.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.472
* Whop ba ba lo bop
a lop bam boom *

17:52.505 --> 17:54.474
* Tutti fruiti, oh, Rudy

17:54.507 --> 17:56.709
* Tutti fruiti,
oh, Rudy *

17:56.743 --> 17:59.446
* Tutti fruiti, oh, Rudy

17:59.479 --> 18:02.615
* Whop ba ba lo bop
a lop bam boom. *

18:02.649 --> 18:07.187
You. You're suspended
from tomorrow's game.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.388
Coach, I'm
not suiting up?

18:08.421 --> 18:10.790
Oh, sure, you can suit up.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.192
But do it at home.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.560
And after you suit up,

18:13.593 --> 18:14.827
I want you to write me an essay

18:14.861 --> 18:17.530
on the events leading up
to World War Two.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.399
And you.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.467
I know, detention.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.635
Oh, no.
Detention is way too easy.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.404
You turned your back on easy

18:24.437 --> 18:25.838
when you did his paper,
Cool Breeze.

18:25.872 --> 18:29.442
So, Lincoln goes through
all this trouble

18:29.476 --> 18:32.512
to issue
the Emancipation Proclamation,

18:32.545 --> 18:35.315
frees your people from slavery,
and what do you do?

18:35.348 --> 18:36.883
you run around doing
other people's work for them.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.385
You're killing me.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.852
Et tu Kunta Kinte?

18:39.886 --> 18:41.821
I'm sorry.
No. I'm sorry.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.456
But I'm going to help you out.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.659
Maybe Lincoln couldn't get
to you, but I can.

18:46.693 --> 18:47.827
What are you going to do?

18:49.629 --> 18:52.299
Wouldn't you like to know?

18:57.870 --> 19:00.373
Oh, how was your day
with the dead people?

19:00.407 --> 19:01.574
I got fired today.

19:01.608 --> 19:02.542
Fired?!

19:02.575 --> 19:03.443
Yes, fired.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.445
Fired

19:05.478 --> 19:07.580
You've never been fired a day
in your life

19:07.614 --> 19:08.548
Yes, fired.

19:08.581 --> 19:09.782
Fired. That
is ridiculous.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.584
Why would he do such a thing?

19:11.618 --> 19:13.420
He said he wanted
a full-time person.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.455
He said crack
was making his business boom.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.724
Fired. Oh, baby,
and you were so happy.

19:17.757 --> 19:18.858
That's true.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.194
Seeing those bodies every day
was an epiphany for me.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.896
Mm. Well, that epiphany
cost $867.42.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.164
What?

19:25.198 --> 19:28.468
That's when my father realized
epiphanies are expensive.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.770
Man. Epiphanies are expensive.

19:30.803 --> 19:31.938
Then he had another epiphany.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.240
I'm never going to get
that money back.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.974
Yes, you will.
I will?

19:35.007 --> 19:37.710
I took all that stuff back.

19:37.744 --> 19:38.378
And here.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.613
No, baby, you can keep that.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.815
Okay.
Hey, Dad.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.617
Do you think Drew can borrow
one of your hats?

19:44.651 --> 19:45.618
Hat?

19:45.652 --> 19:47.587
Drew, get in here.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.726
What the hell happened
to your head?

19:53.760 --> 19:56.329
Before I gave Tonya
a finger wave,

19:56.363 --> 19:58.298
I decided I'd try it on myself.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.300
But I think I left the perm in
too long.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.402
That's $10 worth of perm.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.836
(indistinct announcement
over PA)

20:03.870 --> 20:05.538
Do I really
have to do this?

20:05.572 --> 20:06.573
So, Chris, you want
to work for people?

20:06.606 --> 20:07.974
You want to do
what he does?

20:08.007 --> 20:08.908
You do everything
he does.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.777
I want you to get out
on that field, and...

20:13.513 --> 20:16.316
:
Rock broken up by number 72.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.584
Where'd you go?
I wasn't done talking yet.

20:17.617 --> 20:20.353
What I was saying was, I want
you do get out on that field...

20:20.387 --> 20:22.622
* Everybody hates Chris.
