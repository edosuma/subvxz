01:00.060 --> 01:02.687
<i>Twelve years ago,</i>
<i>I saw a film from South Korea</i>

01:02.771 --> 01:04.981
<i>called </i>Sympathy for Lady Vengeance.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.275
<i>And it completely changed</i>
<i>how I watch movies.</i>

01:08.818 --> 01:11.780
<i>There's a scene where the main character</i>
<i>captures a serial killer.</i>

01:12.822 --> 01:14.908
<i>She finds the relatives</i>
<i>of all of his victims,</i>

01:14.991 --> 01:17.994
<i>and one by one,</i>
<i>they exact their revenge on him.</i>

01:18.787 --> 01:21.247
<i>Even though</i>
<i>all the violence happens off-screen…</i>

01:22.957 --> 01:25.126
<i>…I felt like I saw everything.</i>

01:25.794 --> 01:27.545
<i>I remember even looking away.</i>

01:29.172 --> 01:30.840
<i>And I thought, "Why?"</i>

01:31.466 --> 01:35.637
<i>"What was it about this revenge movie</i>
<i>that affected me where others haven't?"</i>

01:46.189 --> 01:47.190
Ah!

01:48.108 --> 01:51.486
<i> I like revenge stories.</i>
<i>It seems like a lot of people do.</i>

01:51.569 --> 01:53.279
<i>-But why do we like them?</i>

01:53.363 --> 01:54.614
<i>What attracts us?</i>

01:55.115 --> 01:57.867
<i>The common definition</i>
<i>of an act of revenge has two parts.</i>

01:58.368 --> 02:00.203
<i>First, we have a grievance,</i>

02:01.371 --> 02:03.373
<i>and second, a retaliation.</i>

02:03.957 --> 02:06.084
<i>However, I would argue</i>
<i>that there's a third element.</i>

02:07.585 --> 02:09.921
<i>Revenge isn't</i>
<i>an instantaneous tit for tat.</i>

02:10.505 --> 02:13.591
<i>The hero has to stew for a little bit</i>
<i>and then make a choice.</i>

02:14.259 --> 02:15.718
<i>Built into the idea of revenge</i>

02:15.802 --> 02:18.555
<i>is the possibility</i>
<i>that this person could walk away.</i>

02:22.016 --> 02:24.853
<i>But they choose not to</i>
<i>because of one ideal.</i>

02:24.936 --> 02:26.729
There is a thing called justice.

02:26.813 --> 02:27.856
-Justice.
-Justice.

02:27.939 --> 02:28.982
-Justice.
-Justice.

02:29.065 --> 02:31.192
-Justice.
-Well, you're not talking about justice.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.611
-You're talking about revenge.
-Sometimes they're the same.

02:33.695 --> 02:34.988
They're never the same.

02:35.071 --> 02:37.657
<i>Revenge stories</i>
<i>are always about justice.</i>

02:38.241 --> 02:39.367
<i>But what kind?</i>

02:39.450 --> 02:42.787
<i>Most of us live our lives</i>
<i>within the parameters of modern society.</i>

02:43.454 --> 02:46.291
<i>If you have a serious grievance,</i>
<i>you're supposed to take it to the police…</i>

02:46.374 --> 02:48.418
A couple days ago, my wife
and daughter were attacked.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.545
<i>…to the courts, to the newspapers.</i>

02:50.628 --> 02:53.173
<i>These institutions</i>
<i>are there to civilize us</i>

02:53.256 --> 02:54.841
<i>and to keep violence in check.</i>

02:55.341 --> 02:58.178
<i>Revenge stories, on the other hand,</i>
<i>are about wild justice.</i>

02:58.261 --> 03:01.931
<i>About what would happen if we let loose</i>
<i>and took matters into our own hands.</i>

03:02.015 --> 03:02.932
Thanks.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.101


03:05.185 --> 03:07.562
I think justice,
action, and violence,

03:07.645 --> 03:10.648
it's all sort of hemmed in together
of what we're trying to say about it.

03:10.732 --> 03:14.152
In real life, violence happens
for no reason to good people.

03:15.820 --> 03:20.742
And it's never resolved in any way.
I think that sense of injustice,

03:20.825 --> 03:24.120
that lack of satisfaction
is something that people feel upset about.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.581
Man gets shot that's got a gun,

03:27.123 --> 03:29.000
there's room for a reasonable doubt.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.462
Man gets shot that hasn't got a gun,
what would you call it?

03:32.545 --> 03:34.005
It ain't fair!

03:34.088 --> 03:37.300
When you're making fiction,
and you're creating every piece of it,

03:37.383 --> 03:39.636
why not try to balance it out
a little bit?

03:39.719 --> 03:41.930
<i>Revenge itself is hard to control.</i>

03:42.430 --> 03:45.016
<i>But revenge movies are ritualized,</i>
<i>like a sporting event.</i>

03:45.683 --> 03:48.061
<i>A movie sets up parameters</i>
<i>that tell the audience,</i>

03:48.144 --> 03:49.771
<i>"These are the edges of the ring."</i>

03:51.981 --> 03:54.150
<i>We understand that</i>
<i>the movie will only go so far,</i>

03:54.234 --> 03:56.236
<i>and that allows us to enjoy the spectacle.</i>

03:56.319 --> 03:59.155
In some ways,
vengeance narratives,

03:59.239 --> 04:04.077
they're an interesting justification
for depicting graphic violence.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.288
There's the underlying sense that
the justice system isn't going to work,

04:07.372 --> 04:10.833
so sometimes
human vengeance has to step in…

04:13.753 --> 04:17.173
to take on what
the justice system failed to do.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.926
<i>But revenge movies</i>
<i>also walk a fine line.</i>

04:20.510 --> 04:23.888
<i>Because even though the movie might show</i>
<i>how the system isn't doing its job…</i>

04:23.972 --> 04:26.432
It's a fucked-up system
you're sworn to protect.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.142
Never said it was perfect.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.228
So there's nothing you can do?

04:30.812 --> 04:31.854
Nothing that's legal.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.483
<i> …we, as a society, need</i>
<i>those institutions in order to function.</i>

04:36.317 --> 04:39.195
<i>So the revenge movie has to restore</i>
<i>the rules of society</i>

04:39.279 --> 04:40.822
<i>it just blatantly ignored.</i>

04:45.410 --> 04:48.162
<i>And the hero can't just get away</i>
<i>with flaunting the law.</i>

04:48.663 --> 04:50.081
<i>There has to be some price.</i>

04:51.249 --> 04:53.751
<i>Every revenge movie lies</i>
<i>on this sliding scale…</i>

04:53.835 --> 04:54.669


04:54.752 --> 04:57.672
<i>…between the emotional desire</i>
<i>to punish wrongdoers…</i>

04:57.755 --> 04:58.965


05:02.093 --> 05:04.887
<i>…and the ethical implications</i>
<i>of doing that yourself.</i>

05:05.888 --> 05:07.890
<i>And the thing</i>
<i>that draws me back to this genre,</i>

05:07.974 --> 05:11.019
<i>why I like these stories,</i>
<i>is the basic question.</i>

05:12.103 --> 05:15.565
<i>If I were in this situation,</i>
<i>what would I do?</i>

05:24.407 --> 05:28.578
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.164
You killed my father.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.166
Prepare to die.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.961
<i>The ritual of the revenge story</i>
<i>begins with the grievance.</i>

05:37.045 --> 05:38.129
<i>What is the crime?</i>

05:39.964 --> 05:41.007
<i>It has to be bad.</i>

05:41.924 --> 05:44.052
<i>Horrible, humiliating, traumatizing…</i>

05:47.472 --> 05:49.849
<i>enough that the audience</i>
<i>will believe the hero spends</i>

05:49.932 --> 05:52.060
<i>the rest of the movie trying to get even.</i>

05:52.143 --> 05:57.440
Audiences are much more willing to accept
violence in a movie when it's justified.

05:57.523 --> 06:01.944
Audiences actually accept that violence
on a different level…

06:02.445 --> 06:03.905
You killed my father.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.993
Big mistake.

06:10.661 --> 06:15.249
…than they do violence
that is seen as sadistic, perverse

06:15.958 --> 06:19.420
for the sake of suffering,
rather than an act of justice.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.799
<i>At the same time, filmmakers</i>
<i>have to be tactful that they don't show</i>

06:22.882 --> 06:24.008
<i>something too awful.</i>

06:24.509 --> 06:26.427
-

06:28.429 --> 06:32.016
<i>And so what they often do</i>
<i>is leave the crime just off-screen</i>

06:32.100 --> 06:35.019
<i>and instead focus our attention</i>
<i>on the hero's reaction.</i>

06:35.103 --> 06:36.187


06:36.270 --> 06:40.983
One thing that it does
is it builds up the initial victims

06:41.067 --> 06:43.444
as being more worthy.

06:43.528 --> 06:48.950
Their deaths are so significant
that we don't get to witness their deaths,

06:49.033 --> 06:53.538
because, in a way, to show us the violence
would cheapen the experience.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.462
The violence in your mind

07:01.546 --> 07:04.757
is far more powerful
than violence that's actually on-screen.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.092
You can imagine it.

07:06.175 --> 07:09.262
It's all how you perceive
that information.

07:09.345 --> 07:13.182
And actually, I think it's…
somehow it's sometimes more disturbing…

07:16.644 --> 07:18.604
when your mind fills in the blanks.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.358
<i>The revenge story</i>
<i>is all about getting the most sympathy</i>

07:22.442 --> 07:24.569
<i>using the smallest amount of exposition.</i>

07:25.069 --> 07:27.613
<i>And because of that,</i>
<i>filmmakers choose easy victims.</i>

07:28.197 --> 07:30.533
<i>A wife, a child, a pet.</i>

07:30.616 --> 07:33.286

-<i>These characters are thinly sketched.</i>

07:33.369 --> 07:35.872
<i>Enough to gain sympathy</i>
<i>but not enough that they become</i>

07:35.955 --> 07:38.249
<i>three-dimensional</i>
<i>and potentially unlikable.</i>

07:39.500 --> 07:42.920
<i>And when these characters die,</i>
<i>they're often replaced by a token,</i>

07:43.004 --> 07:46.090
<i>a banal item that reminds</i>
<i>the hero of who they once were.</i>

07:46.591 --> 07:49.093
<i>It's visual shorthand</i>
<i>and extremely effective.</i>

07:53.806 --> 07:56.601
<i>In </i>Lady Vengeance<i>,</i>
<i>the grievance is powerful and simple.</i>

07:57.643 --> 08:00.897
<i>The victims are innocent children.</i>
<i>We never see their deaths.</i>

08:01.481 --> 08:05.943
<i>Instead, we watch each parent watch</i>
<i>a tape of their own child being killed.</i>

08:07.195 --> 08:10.490
<i>By the end of this sequence,</i>
<i>I knew what I wanted to happen.</i>

08:11.991 --> 08:14.118
<i>But then the movie did something unusual.</i>

08:14.619 --> 08:16.454
<i>The hero didn't take revenge.</i>

08:16.537 --> 08:18.581
<i>She let these parents choose what to do.</i>

08:19.081 --> 08:21.334


08:24.962 --> 08:28.508
<i> And in doing so,</i>
<i>she let me choose as well.</i>

08:28.591 --> 08:30.593


08:37.683 --> 08:40.186


08:56.202 --> 08:59.288
<i> One of the things that interests me</i>
<i>in revenge stories is the choice.</i>

08:59.372 --> 09:01.374
I've decided what to do with my life.

09:01.457 --> 09:04.126
<i>How does someone decide</i>
<i>to pursue this path?</i>

09:04.210 --> 09:07.463
<i>And how does it change them</i>
<i>once they remove themselves from society?</i>

09:07.547 --> 09:10.132
Never took the time to think about
where I was headed.

09:10.633 --> 09:13.094
And now I'm losing it.
That… I lose that, that's--

09:13.177 --> 09:15.221
-That's--
-That's… that's everything.

09:15.304 --> 09:19.225
<i>We expect the hero to think about</i>
<i>their actions but not for too long.</i>

09:19.308 --> 09:20.977
I hate being called a beaver, don't you?

09:21.060 --> 09:22.270
You gonna apologize or what?

09:23.229 --> 09:24.939
Fuck you!

09:25.022 --> 09:26.857
<i>We already know</i>
<i>what they're going to do.</i>

09:31.946 --> 09:33.739
<i>So what surprised me about </i>Lady Vengeance

09:33.823 --> 09:36.909
<i>was that a group of ordinary people</i>
<i>had to figure it out.</i>

09:36.993 --> 09:41.038
<i>And they didn't see eye to eye.</i>
<i>They argued and fought and compromised.</i>

09:41.706 --> 09:43.708
<i>But eventually, everyone agreed.</i>

09:44.208 --> 09:46.127
<i>This man had to die.</i>

09:46.210 --> 09:48.212
<i>And they were going to do it themselves.</i>

09:50.840 --> 09:51.674


10:02.351 --> 10:03.686
<i>Before a life is taken,</i>

10:03.769 --> 10:06.230
<i>there's another important decision</i>
<i>for the filmmakers to make.</i>

10:07.023 --> 10:10.359
<i>The audience agrees</i>
<i>that the hero deserves their revenge.</i>

10:10.443 --> 10:11.360
<i>But how much?</i>

10:12.903 --> 10:14.780
<i>What is the appropriate amount?</i>

10:14.864 --> 10:17.116
What is the virtue
of a proportional response?

10:17.199 --> 10:18.034
Why is it good?

10:21.078 --> 10:23.331
They hit an airplane,
so we hit a transmitter, right?

10:23.414 --> 10:25.124
That's a proportional response.

10:25.207 --> 10:27.418
<i>One of the important parts</i>
<i>of the ritual of revenge</i>

10:27.501 --> 10:29.462
<i>is that the hero has clear judgment.</i>

10:29.545 --> 10:32.089
<i>They are supposed to hurt</i>
<i>only those who get in the way.</i>

10:32.173 --> 10:34.550
<i>They are not supposed</i>
<i>to target people needlessly.</i>

10:39.722 --> 10:41.641
<i>This is often combined with the fact</i>

10:41.724 --> 10:44.393
<i>that the hero is some kind</i>
<i>of highly trained killing machine,</i>

10:44.477 --> 10:47.146
<i>able to work</i>
<i>with efficiency and brutality.</i>

10:48.439 --> 10:50.983
<i>All of this gives us permission</i>
<i>to enjoy what follows.</i>

10:51.484 --> 10:55.363
<i>Not only is the revenge justified,</i>
<i>it's professional and proportional.</i>

10:55.446 --> 10:58.532
A violent scene
is kind of like a scene in a film musical.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.118
It's about movement of bodies.

11:01.202 --> 11:04.497
It's about spectacle.
It's about the attraction of spectacle

11:04.580 --> 11:07.958
and to get your heart racing
in an interesting way

11:08.042 --> 11:11.003
as you're focusing as a viewer
on what's going on.

11:12.004 --> 11:15.716
And no one's really thinking
about the violence, at some level,

11:15.800 --> 11:17.677
of watching these kinds of things.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.101


11:25.935 --> 11:28.854
<i>But what happens</i>
<i>if a movie breaks these unwritten rules?</i>

11:29.355 --> 11:32.274
<i>What happens when the retaliation</i>
<i>starts to make us uncomfortable</i>,

11:32.358 --> 11:33.734
<i>even if it's justified?</i>

11:34.735 --> 11:35.820


11:35.903 --> 11:38.364
<i>There's one scene from </i>Goodfellas
<i>that always gets me.</i>

11:38.864 --> 11:41.534
<i>Henry Hill gets a call</i>
<i>from his girlfriend, Karen.</i>

11:41.617 --> 11:43.703
<i>She tells him her neighbor</i>
<i>sexually assaulted her.</i>

11:43.786 --> 11:46.831
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me.

11:46.914 --> 11:49.625
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.918
I hit him back.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.255
<i>Henry spots the guy</i>
<i>across the street</i>

11:54.338 --> 11:55.965
<i>and then decides to retaliate.</i>

11:57.091 --> 11:59.260
<i>This is shot in one unbroken take</i>

11:59.343 --> 12:02.680
<i>so that we can see everything</i>
<i>that happens and everyone's reaction.</i>

12:03.180 --> 12:05.474
<i>Do you think this is</i>
<i>a proportional response?</i>

12:07.143 --> 12:09.562
What do you want, fucko?
You want something? Huh?

12:09.645 --> 12:11.313
-Hey!

12:11.397 --> 12:12.857
-Shit!
-What are you doing?

12:17.111 --> 12:20.448
I swear on my fucking mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead!

12:21.407 --> 12:22.491
Fuck!

12:22.575 --> 12:23.617
Don't shoot!

12:23.701 --> 12:25.786
<i>This scene</i>
<i>always makes me uncomfortable</i>,

12:25.870 --> 12:28.289
<i>because it doesn't cut away</i>
<i>from Henry's actions.</i>

12:28.372 --> 12:29.832
<i>It forces me to watch.</i>

12:30.791 --> 12:34.170
<i>But when </i>Goodfellas<i> was aired</i>
<i>on network television, that changed.</i>

12:36.589 --> 12:38.257
You want something? Huh?

12:40.551 --> 12:43.429
I swear on my mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead!

12:44.555 --> 12:45.806
Fuck!

12:45.890 --> 12:47.767
<i>About six seconds was removed.</i>

12:48.642 --> 12:52.104
<i>This new version changes</i>
<i>the original intention of the scene.</i>

12:52.188 --> 12:55.316
<i>Now, a prolonged pistol-whipping</i>
<i>is just a couple of hits.</i>

12:55.816 --> 12:58.652
<i>Ironically, toning down</i>
<i>the amount of violence</i>

12:58.736 --> 13:00.988
<i>makes Henry seem reasonable</i>
<i>and proportional.</i>

13:02.072 --> 13:04.700
<i>It makes this act of revenge</i>
<i>more of a fantasy.</i>

13:05.326 --> 13:08.996
<i>He did what he needed to do.</i>
<i>And now he moves on with his life.</i>

13:09.079 --> 13:11.081


13:16.837 --> 13:17.838
<i>But that's a lie.</i>

13:18.547 --> 13:21.050
People know what's real,

13:21.133 --> 13:24.512
and you live a life
understanding what real violence is

13:24.595 --> 13:27.932
so that you escape
into the… sort of the fantasy

13:28.015 --> 13:32.478
of what violence could be
if it was done in the right way,

13:32.561 --> 13:36.857
if it was applied for the right reasons,
if it was used in a way

13:36.941 --> 13:39.693
that enhanced a sense
of right rather than wrong.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.446
<i> One of last parts</i>
<i>of the revenge story</i>

13:42.530 --> 13:44.073
<i>is that there is always a cost.</i>

13:44.573 --> 13:47.451
<i>No hero who goes on a quest like this</i>
<i>comes out clean.</i>

13:47.535 --> 13:48.828


13:48.911 --> 13:52.206
<i>The avenger, whose journey</i>
<i>has been marked by loneliness,</i>

13:52.289 --> 13:54.333
<i>often ends up cast out of society.</i>

13:54.834 --> 13:57.670
<i>After all, you and I cannot drop out</i>
<i>of our lives,</i>

13:57.753 --> 14:00.756
<i>do what we want, and then expect</i>
<i>things to go back to normal.</i>

14:02.007 --> 14:04.844
<i>Even in our fantasies,</i>
<i>there must be some payment.</i>

14:13.894 --> 14:15.688
<i>The revenge story is one of the few genres</i>

14:15.771 --> 14:18.107
<i>where the hero dying at the end</i>
<i>is acceptable.</i>

14:18.941 --> 14:21.527
<i>We, the audience, get to have</i>
<i>our cake and eat it too.</i>

14:22.027 --> 14:26.949
<i>We get to enjoy the bloody catharsis,</i>
<i>and we get to see balance being restored.</i>

14:28.951 --> 14:32.663
I think, in some ways,
entertainment… is that.

14:32.746 --> 14:35.249
Entertainment is about feeling excitement

14:35.332 --> 14:39.503
about things and situations
that you can experience…

14:41.922 --> 14:46.093
…without dealing with the dangers
and repercussions of doing the real thing.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.971
You know, I'd be interested to hear
why<i> Lady Vengeance…</i>

14:49.054 --> 14:51.515
<i>Sympathy for Lady Vengeance</i>
disturbed you so much.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.893
Was it because of the vengeance

14:53.976 --> 14:56.854
or because it made you question

14:56.937 --> 14:58.731
the validity of the vengeance?

15:00.316 --> 15:03.402
<i>I think this film disturbed me</i>
<i>because it held up a mirror.</i>

15:04.278 --> 15:07.364
<i>The movie very carefully sets up</i>
<i>these violent situations</i>

15:07.448 --> 15:09.366
<i>and then leaves them just off-screen.</i>

15:10.284 --> 15:14.288
<i>I never saw these kids die,</i>
<i>so I imagine something horrible.</i>

15:15.080 --> 15:17.249
<i>And I never saw</i>
<i>the villain being tortured,</i>

15:17.750 --> 15:19.835
<i>so I imagine something even worse.</i>

15:24.965 --> 15:27.593
<i>These parents are ordinary people like me.</i>

15:28.177 --> 15:30.012
<i>They are clumsy and scared.</i>

15:31.805 --> 15:34.183
<i>I thought I was disturbed by the violence.</i>

15:34.850 --> 15:37.519
<i>But I was really disturbed</i>
<i>by the choices they made</i>

15:38.520 --> 15:40.189
<i>and by how easily I went along.</i>

15:41.857 --> 15:44.485
<i>The movie didn't let me sit</i>
<i>and passively observe.</i>

15:44.568 --> 15:46.737
<i>I was in this just as much as them.</i>

15:48.197 --> 15:50.616
<i>And I didn't like what I saw about myself.</i>

15:52.368 --> 15:54.828
<i>Every revenge movie lies</i>
<i>on a sliding scale,</i>

15:56.538 --> 15:59.083
<i>between the emotional desire</i>
<i>to seek justice….</i>

15:59.166 --> 16:00.709
I want you to suffer.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.255
<i> …and the ethical implications</i>
<i>of doing that yourself.</i>

16:06.256 --> 16:08.801
<i>But the thing that haunted me</i>
<i>about this one movie,</i>

16:08.884 --> 16:12.554
<i>why I have a hard time watching it again,</i>
<i>is the lingering question,</i>

16:13.973 --> 16:16.809
<i>if I were in this situation,</i>
<i>what would I do?</i>

16:18.394 --> 16:20.688
<i>And could I live with the consequences?</i>
