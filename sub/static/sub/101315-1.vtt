WEBVTT

00:45.152 --> 00:46.253
What the fuck?

00:50.091 --> 00:51.125
I got you!

00:53.060 --> 00:54.294
Fuck...

03:34.655 --> 03:35.956
<i>Harper.</i>

03:40.193 --> 03:42.162
<i>There's a police officer
here to see you.</i>

03:42.229 --> 03:44.865
<i>Just wants to
ask you some questions.</i>

03:47.501 --> 03:49.503
I'll be back in an hour
to change your bandages

03:49.569 --> 03:51.705
and it'll be time for you to go.

03:59.346 --> 04:04.318
Harper Sykes. My name is Slayton.
I'm a state detective.

04:04.384 --> 04:07.221
I gotta be honest. My boss
doesn't believe your story.

04:07.287 --> 04:09.923
Thinks your little trip
through the Wachitumi Valley

04:09.990 --> 04:11.925
is a hillbilly fairy tale.

04:11.991 --> 04:13.859
Sent me down here to
find out if you're just another

04:13.926 --> 04:16.863
mountain tweaker who
burned herself up in a meth lab.

04:18.165 --> 04:21.100
And once you're
discharged she's gonna

04:21.168 --> 04:24.170
lock you up for stabbing
the state trooper who found you.

04:26.839 --> 04:29.075
But I read his report.

04:29.141 --> 04:30.944
And that's the reason I'm here.

04:32.946 --> 04:35.449
See I've been hearing about
Wachitumi Valley

04:35.516 --> 04:36.984
since I was a boy.

04:38.052 --> 04:43.724
Those myths are legendary
where I come from.

04:43.790 --> 04:46.326
I used to love to hear about

04:46.392 --> 04:50.663
cop-killing Catholics
who didn't bury their dead,

04:50.730 --> 04:54.233
runaway slaves still
practicing voodoo,

04:54.300 --> 04:57.872
leftover Chinamen from
the railroad who ate their own.

05:00.841 --> 05:03.843
But they were
just stories Harper.

05:03.910 --> 05:05.646
That's all they were, no proof.

05:05.711 --> 05:08.983
Never any answers.
No evidence.

05:11.185 --> 05:13.353
So I came here

05:13.420 --> 05:15.721
to get some answers
from your story

05:15.788 --> 05:18.358
and you're going to have to
convince me that you got them.

05:20.593 --> 05:21.896
Or we're going to lock you up.

05:25.232 --> 05:28.169
Report says you were
covered in a slimy gauze.

05:28.235 --> 05:31.472
Totally whacked out, you stabbed
a trooper in the arm with a knife.

05:31.538 --> 05:33.105
You were about to
stab him again...

05:33.173 --> 05:34.341
He was one of them one of them.

05:34.408 --> 05:36.543
One of who?

05:36.610 --> 05:41.182
He said plenty
more where they came from.

05:43.783 --> 05:45.152
Who said that, Harper?

05:48.355 --> 05:49.857
Who said that?

05:51.391 --> 05:52.860
Ravener.

05:54.194 --> 05:55.730
Ravener.

05:56.930 --> 05:58.264
Who is he?

05:59.365 --> 06:01.168
He killed Billy.

06:02.569 --> 06:04.370
Billy.

06:04.437 --> 06:09.408
Billy, right, Billy Harrison,
your missing boyfriend.

06:09.475 --> 06:10.910
They've been ringing
the phone number you gave

06:10.976 --> 06:12.411
for Billy and no answer.

06:12.478 --> 06:14.113
Harper!

06:14.180 --> 06:15.448
No Billy.

06:16.682 --> 06:18.418
No Billy.
No boyfriend.

06:19.485 --> 06:21.288
Billy's not missing.

06:21.355 --> 06:23.858
Ravener killed him.

06:24.625 --> 06:25.925
Where's his body?

06:27.293 --> 06:28.829
I got guys out there
looking for bodies.

06:28.896 --> 06:30.831
They haven't found a body.
Are you...

06:30.898 --> 06:32.799
Are you batshit crazy, Harper?

06:32.865 --> 06:36.036
Is that what you are?
You're just fucking out of your mind nuts?

06:41.375 --> 06:42.442
Fuck you.

06:49.048 --> 06:51.418
So you're a photographer, huh?

06:51.485 --> 06:54.088
Take pictures
of animals in the wild.

06:55.788 --> 06:57.591
I read your bio.

06:57.658 --> 06:59.292
Pretty impressive.

06:59.358 --> 07:02.194
Credited with
photographing two species

07:02.262 --> 07:04.730
thought to be extinct that...

07:04.798 --> 07:07.033
I guess that means
you're pretty good at your job.

07:12.639 --> 07:16.276
What were you doing
in the Wachitumi Valley, Harper?

07:16.343 --> 07:18.578
Looking for a red snake.

07:19.278 --> 07:21.348
What's so special
amount of red snake?

07:24.016 --> 07:27.320
<i>We're not supposed to be there.</i>

15:24.130 --> 15:25.365
Hello.

15:31.004 --> 15:32.306
Hello.

16:25.725 --> 16:27.793
Hey, can I help you?

16:32.999 --> 16:34.634
- ...with something?
- Hey, uh...

16:36.469 --> 16:38.538
Yeah, I need to make a report.

16:39.806 --> 16:41.074
Okay.

16:41.140 --> 16:43.075
I saw something.

16:45.177 --> 16:46.580
All right.

16:47.413 --> 16:48.648
And?

16:52.485 --> 16:53.819
You okay?

16:59.658 --> 17:02.461
I took pictures on my camera.

17:03.395 --> 17:04.663
All right.

17:07.267 --> 17:09.234
Tell you what,

17:09.300 --> 17:11.369
I'll make us some coffee.

17:12.337 --> 17:15.540
And don't you go get what
it is that you want to show me

17:15.607 --> 17:18.242
and then we can sort
it out, is that a deal?

17:18.310 --> 17:19.545
Deal, yeah.

17:20.413 --> 17:21.579
Oh, don't mind him.

17:22.781 --> 17:25.785
I just hire him every once in a while
to keep him out of his mama's hair.

17:27.787 --> 17:29.923
All right.
Have a seat.

17:31.023 --> 17:33.859
<i>Hey, Harper, it's Billy,
just calling to give you an update.</i>

17:33.925 --> 17:39.665
<i>I just left the city, I got about five
hours until I am in the Wachitumi Valley.</i>

17:39.732 --> 17:44.604
<i>And, um, don't call me back,
I'm sure you're out there in the woods</i>

17:44.671 --> 17:47.840
<i>taking photos,
being super cute, um...</i>

17:47.906 --> 17:51.577
<i>I'm going to head right to the bed and
breakfast, I've got extra clothes for you.</i>

17:57.584 --> 17:59.185
Hey, hey!

17:59.251 --> 18:00.452
What the fuck!

18:00.519 --> 18:01.822
Hey, stop!

18:04.190 --> 18:05.525
No!

18:09.261 --> 18:11.865
Somebody help!

20:03.175 --> 20:05.778
You know, I was
on my way to Horsefeathers.

20:05.844 --> 20:08.148
I was just gonna TGIF it.

20:08.213 --> 20:13.118
You know? But I got a call
from the town retard

20:13.185 --> 20:16.722
who said the sheriff had
had a little shutterbug visit.

20:19.491 --> 20:23.363
You're a little snoop, huh?

20:23.429 --> 20:26.399
He said you've been
putting your camera

20:26.465 --> 20:28.867
where you aren't supposed to.

20:30.536 --> 20:32.105
I'm a nature photographer

20:32.172 --> 20:33.206
What?

20:34.673 --> 20:36.307
- You can have my camera.
- I can't hear you.

20:36.375 --> 20:37.911
You can have the camera.

20:39.511 --> 20:40.746
Hmm.

20:41.846 --> 20:43.249
I don't want the camera.

20:44.416 --> 20:45.717
You can have the pictures.

20:45.785 --> 20:49.990
I don't want the pictures.

20:51.391 --> 20:52.926
I want you.

20:56.363 --> 20:57.462
Okay?

20:57.529 --> 20:58.730
Here's how it's going to go.

20:58.798 --> 21:01.366
It's going to be super simple.

21:01.433 --> 21:05.570
You and I we're just going
to duke it out right here. Pow.

21:05.637 --> 21:07.874
These boys?

21:07.941 --> 21:11.277
They're just here to make sure
I do my job. Okay?

21:13.046 --> 21:14.180
So...

21:15.214 --> 21:17.951
Come on out when you're
ready, sweetheart.

21:23.055 --> 21:24.356
No rush.

21:34.634 --> 21:36.935
Come on, it's showtime, lady.

21:38.203 --> 21:39.271
Fuck.

21:43.409 --> 21:44.444
Ow!

21:47.346 --> 21:48.781
Yeah!

21:50.816 --> 21:52.786
You are on the scoreboard.

21:53.719 --> 21:55.889
These boys ain't got shit.

21:59.325 --> 22:01.360
Look at you, huh?

22:01.426 --> 22:05.397
I said I'd give you a fair
fight, getting a jump on me.

22:13.005 --> 22:15.107
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that.

22:15.173 --> 22:19.878
Oh, yeah! Ooh,
I'm falling for you.

22:19.945 --> 22:22.381
- You're a psycho.
- Oh, I'm a psycho?

22:22.448 --> 22:24.817
Girl, you just killed
yourself somebody.

22:24.884 --> 22:30.589
Come here, you are exactly the type
of girl I have been looking for.

22:30.656 --> 22:33.425
You really are.
You got spirit!

22:35.561 --> 22:37.262
I swear to God, I mean, I...

22:39.498 --> 22:41.334
I'm falling for you.

22:43.501 --> 22:45.003
I saw you.

22:48.007 --> 22:51.044
At the tree tearing
that man apart.

22:54.780 --> 22:57.450
That man...

22:57.517 --> 23:01.287
That man was going
to tear my valley part.

23:01.353 --> 23:05.024
That man was a timber
and mineral scout.

23:05.090 --> 23:07.125
We caught him with samples.

23:07.192 --> 23:10.061
You know what that
little fucker was gonna do?

23:10.128 --> 23:12.563
He goes to a big oil company,

23:12.631 --> 23:14.801
he gets a big fat check,

23:14.867 --> 23:17.302
then they go and they lobby

23:17.369 --> 23:19.404
and you know what happens
when the feds get to it?

23:19.471 --> 23:23.876
They sell off the timber and mineral
rights to the highest bidder.

23:23.942 --> 23:25.644
You ever been
to West Virginia?

23:25.711 --> 23:28.381
You see what they've done
to their fucking mountains?

23:32.585 --> 23:35.488
What I did was
preserve a way of life.

23:35.555 --> 23:39.325
That fucker would have
changed everything. Everything!

23:39.391 --> 23:42.161
I saw what you did.
Oh, fuck!

23:42.228 --> 23:46.565
You don't understand, you stupid bitch.
I'm doing what I believe in. Hmm?

23:46.632 --> 23:49.602
Just cause you believe in it
doesn't make it right.

23:49.669 --> 23:51.070
Yes, it does!

23:51.135 --> 23:52.770
You're not listening!

23:52.837 --> 23:54.807
This place is mine!

23:57.876 --> 24:01.614
<i>And I really thought
that you could appreciate this.</i>

24:01.681 --> 24:05.451
<i>We've got the last old-growth
forest on the Atlantic seaboard.</i>

24:07.619 --> 24:09.388
<i>It's just like when
the settlers got here.</i>

24:12.525 --> 24:16.262
<i>Nature girl like you should be
able to appreciate all that.</i>

25:17.257 --> 25:18.423
Hello?

26:09.976 --> 26:11.311
Fuck!

31:54.685 --> 32:00.192
Don't know why some
photo bitch is up here...

32:00.259 --> 32:04.430
Probably sending her pictures
to some fucking prospector.

32:09.101 --> 32:11.704
Man.

32:11.770 --> 32:13.338
Ha ha ha.

32:14.038 --> 32:16.541
You gonna come here...

32:16.607 --> 32:20.511
Force me out of the valley. I ain't
gonna have that, yeah, I'm gonna find it.

32:20.578 --> 32:22.748
I'm gonna catch her...

32:22.815 --> 32:26.250
I'm gonna break her.
I'm gonna break that bitch!

32:26.317 --> 32:27.985
Little cunt.

32:28.053 --> 32:30.222
Dumb fucking bitch.

32:30.288 --> 32:32.857
Oh...

32:45.336 --> 32:46.939
Come on, bitch!

32:48.140 --> 32:49.775
Where you at?

33:00.952 --> 33:05.857
Little Red Riding Hood,
come back out of the forest, huh?

33:11.730 --> 33:13.031
Where's that devil?

33:30.115 --> 33:35.153
Fucking...

33:42.827 --> 33:44.962
Woo-wee!

33:45.029 --> 33:47.098
Yeah. Yeah.

33:51.502 --> 33:54.639
Huh?

33:55.540 --> 33:56.775
You hear me?

34:08.552 --> 34:10.955
What do you think...?

35:23.494 --> 35:24.730
Help.

35:35.340 --> 35:36.876
How do we get out of here?

35:46.251 --> 35:49.087
You ain't ever gonna
get out of here.

35:53.224 --> 35:58.630
I took you on that.
Just so you know.

35:59.965 --> 36:01.300
I had...

36:03.001 --> 36:06.205
I had you good.

36:07.237 --> 36:09.674
I had you good.

36:18.217 --> 36:19.785
You ain't nothing.

45:40.677 --> 45:42.681
<i>Jesse, you there?</i>

45:44.114 --> 45:45.883
<i>Jesse?</i>

45:51.155 --> 45:53.590
<i>Harper Sykes.</i>

45:53.657 --> 45:58.563
<i>Guess you'd be off squawking
away. Had to be you.</i>

45:58.630 --> 46:02.834
You left your wallet in the
truck, so I looked you up a bit.

46:02.900 --> 46:04.902
Googled ya.

46:04.969 --> 46:08.438
<i>A month in Arkansas looking for
the ivory-billed woodpecker,</i>

46:08.505 --> 46:11.341
<i>then hunting
tigers in Asia.</i>

46:11.409 --> 46:13.943
<i>You're G.I. Jane with a camera.</i>

46:14.010 --> 46:16.380
<i>You're the real deal.</i>

46:16.447 --> 46:19.884
Now, you're wondering
if I'm going to hear you coming

46:19.949 --> 46:22.620
<i>and try to ride that
rig out of there.</i>

46:24.054 --> 46:26.625
<i>You're wondering whether
it's worth the risk.</i>

46:30.961 --> 46:35.599
Well, here's the thing. There's
only one way out of the valley.

46:35.666 --> 46:38.836
Burning Falls to the north
is impassable.

46:38.902 --> 46:42.439
<i>The gas station
is a 16-day hike to the west.</i>

46:42.507 --> 46:44.576
<i>And it's going
to take you nearly a month</i>

46:44.643 --> 46:48.211
<i>if you try to go through
the national forest east.</i>

46:48.278 --> 46:50.481
<i>The only way out of there</i>

46:50.547 --> 46:52.549
is coming down the river

46:52.617 --> 46:54.319
<i>and you know that's gonna
happen sooner or later...</i>

50:47.284 --> 50:48.519
Hello?

50:55.293 --> 50:56.760
Hello?

51:22.887 --> 51:24.088
Hello?

51:32.163 --> 51:33.731
Hello?

51:46.344 --> 51:47.778
Hello?

51:51.014 --> 51:52.083
Oh.

51:53.418 --> 51:55.553
Good to see you.

51:56.753 --> 51:59.123
Mallinckrodt.

51:59.190 --> 52:01.092
Harper Sykes.

52:01.159 --> 52:02.226
Sykes.

52:02.293 --> 52:05.796
Very good. Wonderful name.

52:05.862 --> 52:08.298
Want a bourbon?
Yes, yes, you do.

52:08.365 --> 52:11.168
Could I use your phone?

52:11.235 --> 52:12.737
I don't have a phone, ma'am.

52:12.804 --> 52:15.606
I haven't had a phone
for 15 years.

52:16.940 --> 52:17.975
Oh.

52:27.985 --> 52:30.187
I just really need
to make a phone call.

52:30.253 --> 52:33.991
Um, let's go in there
by the fire and get you sorted.

52:39.563 --> 52:43.268
Every time I spill
just a little bit.

52:44.934 --> 52:46.570
You know what I mean?

52:48.239 --> 52:49.740
Daytime drinking.

52:56.179 --> 52:57.981
You're wondering.

53:00.184 --> 53:02.320
This is for my heart,
all of this stuff.

53:02.387 --> 53:04.288
One, two, three, this, four.

53:04.353 --> 53:09.493
This, uh, comes with my
supplies once a week.

53:09.559 --> 53:13.030
- Your supplies.
- Mm-hm.

53:13.097 --> 53:16.467
Everything here is delivered
to me once a week.

53:16.534 --> 53:19.604
And allows me to stay here.

53:25.443 --> 53:27.245
Those books there.

53:27.311 --> 53:30.514
They're a document of how
we tamed this valley.

53:30.581 --> 53:33.351
Felled trees
from all around here

53:33.416 --> 53:35.719
Went down to the river

53:35.786 --> 53:38.521
and got big stones
and brought them up here.

53:38.588 --> 53:42.125
And that's when there were
mosquitoes bigger than hummingbirds.

53:42.193 --> 53:45.763
And there were bears running
around killing people.

53:45.829 --> 53:49.366
It was grim, but we did it.

53:50.900 --> 53:52.803
We built this place.

53:54.806 --> 53:57.275
We tamed this whole valley.

54:21.197 --> 54:24.201
- It's a lot of death.
- That there?

54:24.268 --> 54:28.172
That's the progress
of civilization.

54:28.239 --> 54:29.740
Progress?

54:29.806 --> 54:31.375
Of course.

54:31.442 --> 54:33.710
What do you mean progress?

54:33.777 --> 54:37.780
Societies have long
distinguished themselves

54:37.847 --> 54:40.183
in how they killed their own.

54:41.784 --> 54:43.687
Seems like torture.

54:43.755 --> 54:46.957
No, no, torture's
a whole different matter.

54:47.023 --> 54:50.693
Execution is the measurement

54:50.760 --> 54:53.396
of a country's civility.

54:53.463 --> 54:58.335
Torture is the barometer

54:58.402 --> 55:01.773
of a nation's creativity.

55:03.407 --> 55:07.278
How do you kill people?
How do you keep a man alive

55:07.344 --> 55:10.413
enough to get him to say
what you need him to say?

55:10.480 --> 55:12.817
And everybody had
different ways of doing it.

55:14.719 --> 55:17.320
Proudly named their methods.

55:17.387 --> 55:20.991
The Spanish Donkey
the Iron Maiden.

55:21.057 --> 55:23.559
And there was a cruel,
cruel competition

55:23.626 --> 55:26.230
between the Kings of Pain.

55:27.664 --> 55:32.836
But what do you think scares
man more than anything else?

55:34.938 --> 55:37.808
What do you think
scares him the most?

55:40.510 --> 55:43.014
Mother Nature.

55:46.282 --> 55:52.789
Because Mother Nature
is the true Lord of Pain.

56:05.068 --> 56:08.172
- Want another drink?
- No, thanks.

56:08.237 --> 56:11.141
I'm going to have one,
if you don't mind.

57:19.208 --> 57:23.181
I know you didn't ask for it.
There you go.

57:25.581 --> 57:26.951
You murder it.

57:29.286 --> 57:30.855
Wow.

57:34.291 --> 57:35.927
Thatta girl.

57:53.311 --> 57:57.381
While I do this can you come over
here and turn this thing off?

58:11.228 --> 58:12.929
Ah.

58:24.342 --> 58:26.143
Oh, my God.

58:32.215 --> 58:36.252
You motherfucking bitch.

58:43.027 --> 58:44.327
Sykes.

58:46.831 --> 58:48.532
Sykes!

58:49.632 --> 58:51.134
Goddamnit!

58:57.974 --> 59:00.010
Sykes!

59:08.585 --> 59:11.355
I know what you
saw down at the river.

59:11.422 --> 59:14.592
Where you were taking
your pictures.

59:15.960 --> 59:19.630
What you saw was a hollow cross.

59:21.364 --> 59:26.036
I, uh, came up
with that myself.

59:30.840 --> 59:33.643
You run on along.

59:33.710 --> 59:35.811
They're waiting for you.

01:00:33.903 --> 01:00:36.873
<i>...continue to
indicate a severe thunderstorm</i>

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:41.244

01:00:41.311 --> 01:00:44.048

<i>or about over Presbiet and moving

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.002
<i>This is a dangerous situation.</i>

01:01:06.068 --> 01:01:10.239
<i>If you are in the path of this storm,

01:01:10.306 --> 01:01:15.079

01:01:15.144 --> 01:01:19.650

01:01:19.715 --> 01:01:22.918
<i>Report any damage to the

01:01:22.985 --> 01:01:26.190
<i>for relay to the National
Weather Service.</i>

01:05:13.217 --> 01:05:14.617
Hello?

01:05:17.121 --> 01:05:18.989
Hey? Hello?

01:05:19.054 --> 01:05:22.925
Darlene, damn pump's
out again. Darlene?

01:05:37.072 --> 01:05:39.076
I'm going to take my revolver out
and put it down on the ground.

01:06:02.666 --> 01:06:06.068
Billy and I have been looking
for you since yesterday.

01:06:06.135 --> 01:06:07.871
Where you been?

01:06:09.271 --> 01:06:11.208
That boyfriend of yours
has covered nearly every inch

01:06:11.273 --> 01:06:13.042
of this valley looking for you.

01:06:35.097 --> 01:06:36.733
It's okay.

01:06:38.101 --> 01:06:39.603
Okay.

01:06:46.376 --> 01:06:48.479
Where'd you run off to? Huh?

01:06:51.347 --> 01:06:54.117
I found your truck.
I got all your stuff in my cruiser.

01:06:57.219 --> 01:06:58.688
Alright?

01:07:02.125 --> 01:07:03.626
It'll be okay.

01:07:07.931 --> 01:07:08.965
Let's go.

01:07:35.192 --> 01:07:36.760
Can you tell me what happened?

01:07:37.827 --> 01:07:40.063
I'm running from them.

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:41.497
Who?

01:07:41.563 --> 01:07:43.500
I'll show you.

01:08:24.073 --> 01:08:27.777
No! No! No!

01:09:21.398 --> 01:09:25.801
In ancient times the Slavs
used to get answers from people

01:09:25.868 --> 01:09:30.106
by using their cows
for more than just milk.

01:09:31.375 --> 01:09:33.908
You see, digesting all the food

01:09:33.975 --> 01:09:37.212
that one of these guys
eats in a day,

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:40.314
that requires
a very special system.

01:09:40.381 --> 01:09:44.653
So these big beautiful beasts
they have four stomachs.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:49.658
They're basically
just a big old vat

01:09:49.725 --> 01:09:52.929
of the world's most toxic acid.

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:56.899
A long time ago
there were these

01:09:56.966 --> 01:10:00.670
two dairy farmers.

01:10:00.737 --> 01:10:03.672
And they had overthrown
this horrid king

01:10:03.739 --> 01:10:06.909
who was famous
for his most wicked ways.

01:10:06.975 --> 01:10:09.345
He just loved torture.

01:10:09.412 --> 01:10:11.280
He loved impalements.

01:10:11.347 --> 01:10:14.082
He loved Judas cradles.

01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:18.387
He loved coffin tortures.
All the good stuff.

01:10:18.454 --> 01:10:22.826
Now, these brothers, they'd
sacked the castle, right?

01:10:22.893 --> 01:10:28.363
And the king, who obviously has
no idea about his predicament,

01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:30.699
he just offers up his kingdom.

01:10:30.766 --> 01:10:32.969
Throws the queen and his
children and the village

01:10:33.034 --> 01:10:37.206
if they'll just let
his cowardly ass go.

01:10:37.273 --> 01:10:39.775
These revolutionaries...

01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:43.947
they're just simple

01:10:44.012 --> 01:10:46.015
little dairy farmers.

01:10:46.082 --> 01:10:49.586
And to them, you know,
this doesn't sound right.

01:10:54.289 --> 01:10:59.962
So... they throw a huge banquet
in the king's court.

01:11:00.029 --> 01:11:02.731
Everybody's there,
the whole royal family.

01:11:02.798 --> 01:11:06.601
The brothers are sitting there and
they're all just having a grand time.

01:11:06.668 --> 01:11:09.639
Then somebody leads a cow in.

01:11:09.706 --> 01:11:12.842
One of the brothers, he gets up.

01:11:12.908 --> 01:11:14.543
He goes to the banquet table

01:11:14.609 --> 01:11:17.413
and he takes
out a huge carving knife.

01:11:18.948 --> 01:11:25.287
Then the dairy farmer
takes a knife.

01:11:28.091 --> 01:11:32.729
He creates a small cavity
just below the anus.

01:11:35.198 --> 01:11:41.537
Then the other brother,
he binds the king's feet.

01:11:41.604 --> 01:11:43.240
And his hands.

01:11:44.173 --> 01:11:46.842
And then to everyone's shock,

01:11:46.909 --> 01:11:49.546
they slide the king
inside the cow.

01:11:49.613 --> 01:11:53.684
They start stitching up
around the king's neck.

01:11:55.984 --> 01:12:00.155
These Slavs had seen it all.

01:12:00.222 --> 01:12:01.858
Their king...

01:12:02.824 --> 01:12:06.496
with a head sticking
out of a calf.

01:12:06.563 --> 01:12:09.599
This was new
this was groundbreaking.

01:12:11.534 --> 01:12:15.372
They said it took about three days
for the king's body to decompose.

01:12:23.045 --> 01:12:24.480
What are you laughing at?

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:35.024
I saw the picture of all of you
at the old man's house.

01:12:36.859 --> 01:12:38.995
That's what you're laughing at?

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.896
I killed all of them.

01:12:43.498 --> 01:12:46.836
Yeah. I blew that
Kinsey guy's face off.

01:12:48.305 --> 01:12:51.208
And the tweaker...

01:12:52.541 --> 01:12:54.244
He got shot to pieces.

01:12:55.779 --> 01:12:59.282
And then that creepy guy
with the smile.

01:13:01.484 --> 01:13:03.019
Lost his head.

01:13:05.689 --> 01:13:08.792
And that old sick demented fuck.

01:13:12.462 --> 01:13:14.965
He had himself a meth-induced
heart attack.

01:13:17.065 --> 01:13:18.969
He was in a lot of pain.

01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:22.405
So I shot him.

01:13:25.809 --> 01:13:28.177
Yeah, I got your
whole fucked-up clan.

01:13:30.913 --> 01:13:34.818
Well, there's a lot more
where that came from.

01:13:37.587 --> 01:13:40.323
You're the coward
who couldn't find me.

01:13:43.126 --> 01:13:46.128
You get some tired cop
to come pick me up?

01:13:52.301 --> 01:13:53.569
Untie me.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.877
So I can claw
your fucking face off.

01:14:00.944 --> 01:14:02.846
- Oh?
- Yeah.

01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:10.920
I'm going to torture you.

01:14:10.985 --> 01:14:12.588
- You are?
- Yeah.

01:14:13.756 --> 01:14:15.891
And then I'm gonna kill you.

01:14:16.893 --> 01:14:18.228
Yeah.

01:14:22.899 --> 01:14:24.134
Then...

01:14:26.735 --> 01:14:28.470
I'm going to drag you across...

01:14:29.672 --> 01:14:31.541
the floor over to that door.

01:14:35.578 --> 01:14:38.314
I'm going to watch the pigs

01:14:38.381 --> 01:14:41.117
tear you apart.

01:14:42.452 --> 01:14:44.621
- Come on.
- You motherfucker!

01:15:13.716 --> 01:15:15.750
I got you, you motherfucker!

01:15:18.822 --> 01:15:20.923
I got you, you motherfucker.

01:15:35.238 --> 01:15:36.506
No?

01:15:55.957 --> 01:15:57.226
Harper!

01:16:05.935 --> 01:16:08.438
The doctor is waiting
for you with the lab results.

01:16:10.006 --> 01:16:11.541
And it's time for you to go.

01:16:14.176 --> 01:16:15.679
Wait.

01:16:18.081 --> 01:16:19.983
I'm almost done.

01:16:23.252 --> 01:16:24.587
After he beat me...

01:16:24.654 --> 01:16:28.358
And no one cares...

01:16:29.759 --> 01:16:32.028
After he stabbed me.

01:16:36.998 --> 01:16:41.270
After he fed my boyfriend
to his pig.

01:16:42.003 --> 01:16:43.439
No!

01:16:49.212 --> 01:16:53.816
After he hung me upside down

01:16:53.881 --> 01:16:56.018
and left me for dead.

01:16:58.354 --> 01:17:01.291
After he terrorized me.

01:17:06.028 --> 01:17:09.966
<i>After he butchered a cow.</i>

01:17:10.033 --> 01:17:12.102
<i>And gutted it.</i>

01:17:14.235 --> 01:17:16.038
<i>After stitching...</i>

01:17:19.876 --> 01:17:22.744
Where are you going, Ginger?

01:17:22.811 --> 01:17:25.215
You're gonna miss the best part.

01:17:27.115 --> 01:17:29.585
I think you're ill.

01:17:29.652 --> 01:17:34.923
I think you are the victim of a
dangerous opioid epidemic and...

01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:39.229
you're troubled, and you and
whoever you're hanging out with...

01:17:40.595 --> 01:17:42.531
pose a great danger
to yourselves.

01:17:53.242 --> 01:17:56.179
<i>Detective Slayton,
shut the door, please.</i>

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:00.316
In your officer's report
it says my patient was covered

01:18:00.381 --> 01:18:03.452
in a Vaseline-like substance
and that her burns

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.922
- are the likely result of an explosion.
- I know all that.

01:18:05.988 --> 01:18:07.789
She wasn't covered in Vaseline.

01:18:07.856 --> 01:18:12.994
And it wasn't heat which
created her third degree burns.

01:18:13.061 --> 01:18:15.364
What kind of burns are they?

01:18:17.966 --> 01:18:20.902
The lab report states
that she was embalmed

01:18:20.970 --> 01:18:24.140
in the digestive enzymes
of ox bile.

01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:33.382
She was being digested.
