WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:03.772
Three teenage boys go missing

00:03.797 --> 00:05.297
from a school field trip,
then one of them

00:05.322 --> 00:06.955
winds up back at school, dead.

00:06.980 --> 00:09.647
We found Lucas Garza's body
at a Catholic church.

00:09.649 --> 00:12.316
You know who hangs out
at Catholic churches?

00:12.318 --> 00:13.518
Priests.

00:13.520 --> 00:15.086
Father Jonas tried to stop me

00:15.088 --> 00:18.189
from looking into the locker
of Ryan Rojas.

00:18.191 --> 00:20.681
Where in Mexico is Father Jonas?

00:20.683 --> 00:21.659
I can't say.

00:21.661 --> 00:23.061
Maybe Dr. Garza found out

00:23.063 --> 00:24.495
his wife was having an affair

00:24.497 --> 00:26.831
with Father Casanova and blamed his son.

00:26.833 --> 00:28.866
Mateo received a very angry phone call

00:28.868 --> 00:30.268
from a Marvin Garret.

00:30.270 --> 00:32.036
Marvin Garret, you're under arrest.

00:32.037 --> 00:34.372
What'd you do, you bastard?
What did you do to my son?!

00:34.374 --> 00:35.873
None of these questions matter

00:35.875 --> 00:38.009
while Miguel and Ryan are still missing.

00:38.011 --> 00:39.010
And if they're alive,

00:39.012 --> 00:40.678
they're my number-one suspects.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.513
Earlier today, Miguel Diaz and Ryan Rojas

00:42.515 --> 00:44.082
have been found in Mexico.

00:44.084 --> 00:45.383
Questions remain.

00:45.385 --> 00:47.051
Were they victims or perpetrators?

00:47.053 --> 00:50.188
I want a court order removing
Ryan and Miguel

00:50.190 --> 00:52.056
from FBI custody.

00:53.326 --> 00:54.392
Sharon?

00:54.394 --> 00:55.460
- My God.
- Sharon!

00:55.462 --> 00:57.295
Oh, my...

01:00.433 --> 01:01.471
Sharon!

01:13.179 --> 01:15.012
Sharon?

01:15.014 --> 01:17.281
Sharon, can you hear me?

01:17.283 --> 01:19.283
Sharon, you fainted.

01:19.285 --> 01:21.018
Are you okay?

01:22.889 --> 01:24.489
Um, she's over here.

01:24.491 --> 01:25.623
Uh, over here on the floor.

01:25.625 --> 01:28.359
Hurry! Hurry, damn it! Hurry!

01:28.947 --> 01:30.428
What's her name?

01:30.430 --> 01:32.663
Commander. Sharon.

01:32.665 --> 01:33.865
Her name is Sharon.

01:33.867 --> 01:35.829
Sharon, ‭can you tell me what hurts?

01:36.436 --> 01:37.802
It's gonna be okay, Sharon.

01:37.804 --> 01:39.370
Does she have any conditions
we should know about?

01:39.372 --> 01:41.672
Well, uh... uh, she had the flu
a couple of weeks ago,

01:41.674 --> 01:43.107
but she's been getting better.

01:43.109 --> 01:44.709
1, 2, 3.

01:44.711 --> 01:47.478
Get in your cars and lead this ambulance.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.514
Three sets of sirens are better than one.

01:49.516 --> 01:50.648
I'm leaving with her.

01:50.650 --> 01:51.983
All right.

01:51.985 --> 01:53.484
Let us know how she is
as soon as you can.

01:53.486 --> 01:54.865
You got it.

01:56.156 --> 01:57.285
Is she...

01:57.287 --> 01:59.557
She's none of your damn business
is what she is,

01:59.559 --> 02:02.560
unless you're going
to answer her question.

02:02.562 --> 02:04.729
Where are those boys?

02:04.731 --> 02:06.130
Sir, ‭we're not authorized to...

02:06.132 --> 02:08.265
Then get the hell out of our Murder Room.

02:08.268 --> 02:09.500
Oh, do you need a hand?

02:09.502 --> 02:11.068
Here. Let me help.

02:12.639 --> 02:14.539
Are you serious, Lieutenant?
This is not helping...

02:14.541 --> 02:18.809
Are you going to suggest to me
how we should do things here

02:18.811 --> 02:20.578
after you went behind our back,

02:20.580 --> 02:22.480
after you endangered the lives
of this division?

02:22.482 --> 02:24.248
- Come on. We...
- Chief Mason, I want

02:24.250 --> 02:30.021
these bastards out
of our Murder Room right now.

02:30.725 --> 02:32.156
Lieutenant, come on.

02:32.158 --> 02:34.559
Let's go.

02:34.561 --> 02:36.227
You don't know me, but believe this...

02:36.229 --> 02:37.662
if the lieutenant wants

02:37.664 --> 02:40.231
you lying sons of bitches out of here,

02:40.233 --> 02:42.066
that's what will happen.

Special Agents Vega, Fey,

02:55.848 --> 02:58.745
before you leave, in my office, please.

02:59.852 --> 03:01.953
Lieutenant Provenza,
you're in charge here.

03:03.456 --> 03:04.960
Excuse me.

03:18.932 --> 03:22.473
Okay. So, now what do we do?

03:24.110 --> 03:29.814
We hope that Sharon
‭is just dehydrated or exhausted.

03:29.816 --> 03:34.740
And we... we get briefed
in the only way possible.

03:35.699 --> 03:38.322
From the moment the St.
Joseph's Three went missing

03:38.324 --> 03:40.024
until just a few hours ago,

03:40.026 --> 03:42.560
authorities have been able
to produce only one thing...

03:42.562 --> 03:43.794
questions.

03:43.796 --> 03:44.895
Anxious parents are eager

03:44.897 --> 03:46.000
to see their children.

03:46.002 --> 03:48.266
The Diaz family is evidently
leaving for the FBI...

03:48.268 --> 03:50.034
a chance to reunite with their son.

03:50.036 --> 03:52.970
Our source in the FBI has informed us

03:52.972 --> 03:56.207
that Ryan and Miguel were found in Mexico

03:56.209 --> 04:00.211
in what increasingly looks
like a hoax gone wrong.

04:00.213 --> 04:02.146
What we know for certain
is that neither boy

04:02.148 --> 04:03.781
was considered physically harmed.

04:03.783 --> 04:05.616
Or admitted to a hospital.

04:05.618 --> 04:06.917
We need ‭an E.R. doctor immediately!

04:06.919 --> 04:08.352
She lost consciousness and hit her head.

04:08.354 --> 04:09.552
Happened 30 minutes ago.

04:09.554 --> 04:10.738
You can take her
to critical bay number 2.

04:10.740 --> 04:12.571
- I'm okay.
- Sir, ‭I know that this is hard.

04:12.573 --> 04:14.659
- Please wait out here while we help her.
- I'm her husband.

04:14.661 --> 04:15.793
Okay, sorry,
‭but we don't allow family to...

04:15.795 --> 04:17.161
Also, I have one of these.

04:17.163 --> 04:18.928
We've contacted Rosarito police,

04:18.930 --> 04:20.765
who had been holding Ryan and Miguel

04:20.767 --> 04:22.132
in custody for several days

04:22.135 --> 04:23.768
on suspicion of trafficking drugs.

04:23.770 --> 04:25.936
But the Mexican authorities
did not explain

04:25.938 --> 04:28.039
why they delivered the boys to the FBI,

04:28.041 --> 04:30.741
and the death of Lucas Garza
has not been mentioned.

04:30.743 --> 04:32.043
Ms. Rojas, have you been in contact

04:32.045 --> 04:33.411
with the FBI about your son?

04:33.413 --> 04:35.012
Please move! I don't want to hit you!

04:35.014 --> 04:36.847
Was your son involved
with the death of Lucas Garza?

04:36.849 --> 04:38.516
Were your son and his friends
with anyone else?

04:38.518 --> 04:39.583
Was anyone else involved?!

04:39.585 --> 04:42.720
Yes, Father Jonas is in Mexico,

04:42.722 --> 04:46.123
doing unrelated missionary work
very far away from Rosarito,

04:46.125 --> 04:47.992
where these two boys were found

04:47.994 --> 04:50.628
in the custody of the local authorities

04:50.630 --> 04:53.397
and, as I understand it, in possession

04:53.399 --> 04:56.033
of a large amount of opioids.

04:56.035 --> 04:58.669
It is very irresponsible
under the circumstances

04:58.671 --> 05:01.072
to suggest Father Jonas or the Church

05:01.074 --> 05:04.408
had anything to do with
the disappearance of these boys,

05:04.410 --> 05:05.676
whom we can only assume

05:05.678 --> 05:07.311
are lucky to be alive

05:07.313 --> 05:10.348
and in the safe hands
of the American government.

05:10.350 --> 05:11.982
He means the FBI,

05:11.984 --> 05:14.118
who have had those boys now

05:14.120 --> 05:17.488
for over 24 hours without sharing jack.

05:17.490 --> 05:19.790
Don't expect them to be
overflowing with human kindness

05:19.792 --> 05:21.325
after the way you threw them out.

05:21.327 --> 05:23.594
With Major Crimes temporarily
under your command...

05:23.596 --> 05:25.563
And as my first official act,

05:25.565 --> 05:27.965
I'd like to say what a terrible idea

05:27.967 --> 05:31.802
this joint task force
with the FBI turned out to be.

05:31.804 --> 05:33.971
They did nothing but lie,

05:33.973 --> 05:36.006
withhold information, act superior.

05:36.008 --> 05:38.876
It was outrageous and unprofessional

05:38.878 --> 05:40.311
and probably contributed

05:40.313 --> 05:41.979
to the collapse of Sharon Raydor,

05:41.981 --> 05:44.615
who, by the way,
‭is still undergoing tests

05:44.617 --> 05:46.384
while we stand here.

05:46.386 --> 05:48.319
Are you done complaining?

05:48.321 --> 05:49.620
Don't ask the impossible.

05:49.622 --> 05:51.422
At least the FBI found these boys.

05:51.424 --> 05:53.157
I don't see a report on my desk
with your names on it

05:53.159 --> 05:55.092
saying you even
‭looked for them in Mexico.

05:55.094 --> 05:57.228
Rosarito dropped them in their laps.

05:57.230 --> 05:59.797
It had nothing to do
with the FBI's investigation.

05:59.799 --> 06:02.833
Plus, the FBI let us
antagonize the Church

06:02.835 --> 06:04.368
by not sharing crucial information

06:04.370 --> 06:06.103
while we were serving exhumation orders.

06:06.105 --> 06:09.974
We raided Marvin Garret's
white-pride clubhouse

06:09.976 --> 06:11.876
and could've ended up in a shootout

06:11.878 --> 06:14.245
with his crazy, unhyphenated friends.

06:14.247 --> 06:16.113
I've addressed the FBI
about their behavior,

06:16.115 --> 06:17.782
and they've addressed us about ours.

06:17.784 --> 06:20.184
From now on,
‭let's aim for civility, huh?

06:20.186 --> 06:21.819
Goes both ways, Chief.

06:21.821 --> 06:23.621
We should've known
the boys were found immediately

06:23.623 --> 06:26.490
and been included in
notifications and interviews.

06:26.492 --> 06:27.958
Memories get fuzzy,

06:27.960 --> 06:29.627
becoming memories of memories
even after a day.

06:29.629 --> 06:31.462
And the first interviews
with missing kids

06:31.464 --> 06:32.997
are hugely important.

06:32.999 --> 06:36.233
Or the first interviews with suspects.

06:36.235 --> 06:38.502
They knew Lucas was a diabetic.

06:38.504 --> 06:39.970
Keeping him from his insulin

06:39.972 --> 06:41.505
during a drug-trafficking scheme,

06:41.507 --> 06:43.107
that's felony murder.

06:43.109 --> 06:46.310
Which means Miguel and Ryan
are our business,

06:46.312 --> 06:48.345
not the FBI's.

06:48.347 --> 06:51.081
Which is why, if you'd give me
a moment to explain,

06:51.083 --> 06:53.350
the FBI agreed to pass them
directly to us

06:53.352 --> 06:55.252
instead of releasing them
to their parents,

06:55.254 --> 06:58.956
along with all copies of notes
pertaining to their interviews.

06:58.958 --> 07:01.325
Contact the bureau about the transfer.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.428
Probably best to let someone
else make that call, Lieutenant.

07:04.430 --> 07:05.629
Thank you.

07:05.631 --> 07:06.997
Wha... Uh...

07:06.999 --> 07:08.966
Lieutenant, I'll talk to Vega.

07:08.968 --> 07:10.468
No, actually, I'll talk to Fey,

07:10.470 --> 07:12.703
uh, make sure we set up
the transfer of those boys

07:12.705 --> 07:13.938
back to us properly.

07:13.940 --> 07:16.373
Wish the FBI did video interviews.

07:16.375 --> 07:18.576
Well, maybe the notes will help us.

07:18.578 --> 07:22.813
Cami, everyone needs to study
the notes that the FBI took

07:22.815 --> 07:25.983
in the interviews with Ryan and Miguel.

07:25.985 --> 07:28.552
Each word those boys uttered

07:28.554 --> 07:31.489
could be an opportunity
to catch them in a lie.

07:31.491 --> 07:33.991
I'll keep going through the laptop
we found at Marvin's place.

07:33.993 --> 07:36.327
Now, if he forcibly tried to
deport those boys to Mexico...

07:36.329 --> 07:38.362
But does Marvin have anything
to do with the opioids?

07:38.364 --> 07:40.197
The news said that Mexican
authorities found o...

07:40.199 --> 07:42.766
Wait, wait, look, I will come up
with the questions.

07:42.768 --> 07:44.802
Your job is to assemble some answers.

07:44.804 --> 07:47.450
I'll be back after I see the commander.

07:50.042 --> 07:54.311
Okay. Uh, they already did,
like, an EKG or an EEG...

07:54.313 --> 07:56.547
or maybe both... and an MRI.

07:56.549 --> 07:58.382
All of that for the flu?

07:59.252 --> 08:00.818
Doctor said it was standard.

08:00.820 --> 08:02.152
Oh.

08:02.154 --> 08:04.855
Oh, well, I-I'm sure
that they saw her insurance

08:04.857 --> 08:06.257
and realized that she could afford

08:06.259 --> 08:08.959
every expensive exam in the book.

08:08.961 --> 08:10.261
But don't you worry about it

08:10.263 --> 08:12.630
'cause I've had all those tests myself.

08:12.892 --> 08:14.644
And look at me.

08:19.205 --> 08:20.671
Lieutenant!

08:20.673 --> 08:22.806
You didn't need to come
all the way down here.

08:22.808 --> 08:25.409
Aw, Commander, you certainly seem

08:25.411 --> 08:27.177
to be better ‭than when I last saw you.

08:27.179 --> 08:29.947
So, uh, have you gotten a diagnosis yet?

08:29.949 --> 08:32.249
No. We're waiting for the doctor.

08:32.251 --> 08:35.318
To tell us what we already know,
which is she had the flu,

08:35.321 --> 08:37.821
she works too much,
and she needed some rest.

08:37.823 --> 08:39.188
What's going on with the case?

08:39.191 --> 08:40.758
Sharon, you're off the clock.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.126
But I'm curious.

08:42.128 --> 08:45.229
Well, the FBI is turning
over the boys to us,

08:45.231 --> 08:48.232
and, uh, we want to transport them to PAB

08:48.234 --> 08:50.334
without the parents knowing.

08:50.336 --> 08:53.070
Well, maybe I can get back
before you talk to them.

08:53.072 --> 08:54.538
- Oh, my God. Mom.
- What?

08:54.540 --> 08:56.507
Sharon, you'll need
a physician to sign off

08:56.509 --> 08:58.342
on whether you can go back to work or not

08:58.344 --> 08:59.843
because them's the rules.

08:59.845 --> 09:02.680
The rules, Mom. The rules.

09:02.682 --> 09:04.381
Look, the boys are alive,

09:04.383 --> 09:07.351
and they've already told
their story once to the FBI.

09:07.353 --> 09:10.354
We're just going to confirm the details.

09:10.356 --> 09:11.922
Do any of the details include

09:11.924 --> 09:13.857
why the boys left
‭the field trip to begin with

09:13.859 --> 09:14.959
or where they were going?

09:14.961 --> 09:16.894
Uh, not that I know of.

09:16.896 --> 09:18.996
But Nolan and Paige

09:18.998 --> 09:21.198
have been checking every special event

09:21.200 --> 09:23.701
advertised in that area on that day.

09:23.703 --> 09:26.170
So far, there's no event

09:26.172 --> 09:30.107
that a kid would describe
as "the coolest thing."

09:30.109 --> 09:31.909
Uh, mind if I talk to my patient?

09:31.911 --> 09:33.677
- Sharon Raydor?
- Yes, that would be me.

09:33.679 --> 09:35.145
Hi. I'm Dr. Carson Jacobs.

09:35.147 --> 09:36.480
- Hello.
- ‭Hello.

09:36.482 --> 09:38.657
Your internist, Dr. Evans, asked
me to look at the results

09:38.659 --> 09:40.684
- of all your tests.
- ‭Right.

09:40.686 --> 09:42.886
Uh, if I could just
talk to you alone for a minute?

09:42.888 --> 09:44.021
I'm her son.

09:44.023 --> 09:46.023
I'm her husband. Well, almost.

09:46.025 --> 09:48.892
And I am her esteemed colleague.

09:48.894 --> 09:50.694
Colleagues are definitely leaving.

09:50.696 --> 09:52.029
Children, leaving,

09:52.031 --> 09:53.764
and unmarried partners are also leaving.

09:54.767 --> 09:56.867
You want me to hold that for you
while you wait outside?

09:56.869 --> 09:58.602
Andy, it's okay.

09:58.604 --> 10:00.617
I-I promise I'll brief
you all when I'm done.

10:00.642 --> 10:01.697
‭Okay. Fine.

10:01.699 --> 10:03.040
But if you tell me that the doctor said

10:03.042 --> 10:04.408
you can go back to work,
then I'm gonna...

10:04.410 --> 10:06.710
Flynn. Flynn, we've been asked to leave.

10:06.712 --> 10:08.912
So, uh, good luck,

10:08.914 --> 10:11.094
and I will talk to you later today.

10:15.821 --> 10:18.309
It's gonna be fine.

10:23.963 --> 10:25.396
Got some willing advocates there.

10:25.398 --> 10:27.264
Yes, well, ‭I think that they would take

10:27.266 --> 10:29.466
the hospital's side over mine.

10:29.468 --> 10:31.502
So, doctor, have you been able

10:31.504 --> 10:34.071
to figure out ‭what's going on with me?

10:34.492 --> 10:36.607
Yeah, I have.

10:36.609 --> 10:37.686
And, uh, it's more

10:37.688 --> 10:39.977
than just difficulty
recovering from the flu

10:39.979 --> 10:41.624
or a bump on the head.

10:42.625 --> 10:43.547
What I'm about to tell you

10:43.549 --> 10:45.482
is gonna initially sound upsetting,

10:46.087 --> 10:48.185
but we have ways
‭of dealing with this problem,

10:48.506 --> 10:50.554
and we've caught it so soon

10:50.556 --> 10:54.425
that I think, no matter what,
you'll end up in a good place.

11:22.076 --> 11:23.648
Why can't I go home?

11:23.650 --> 11:25.900
Ryan, we know you and Miguel
have been through a lot.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.486
We just have a few questions.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.520
We've been working really hard
to find you guys,

11:29.522 --> 11:31.622
but before we can release you
to your parents,

11:31.624 --> 11:35.059
there's important stuff we're
required to ask you by law.

11:35.061 --> 11:37.470
It's just telling us what happened to you

11:37.472 --> 11:39.163
and especially to Lucas.

11:39.165 --> 11:40.798
The FBI said Lucas was found

11:40.800 --> 11:42.466
in St. Joseph's in a flower bed.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.502
- The FBI.
- The FBI told you that?

11:44.504 --> 11:46.837
They couldn't just say he was found dead.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.072
- I can't believe it.
- No, no.

11:48.074 --> 11:49.640
They had to give the circumstances.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.042
Wonderful.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.443
It was, you know, upsetting.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.811
And crazy.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.546
Like, he couldn't see how
things could ever go wrong.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.881
Turn Miguel up.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.682
The whole thing was his idea.

11:58.684 --> 11:59.817
What whole thing?

11:59.819 --> 12:01.485
Where was Lucas taking you?

12:01.487 --> 12:03.354
We already told the FBI
we don't know, okay?

12:03.356 --> 12:05.089
We don't know where Lucas was taking us.

12:05.091 --> 12:07.024
He just told us he had
the greatest surprise ever,

12:07.026 --> 12:08.259
and we trusted him.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.794
Surprise? What kind of surprise?

12:09.796 --> 12:11.262
He said we'd find out Thursday morning

12:11.264 --> 12:13.297
if we'd slip off with him
on the field trip.

12:13.299 --> 12:16.267
So we agreed to go when Lucas told us to.

12:16.269 --> 12:19.170
And in the museum,
about an hour before lunch,

12:19.172 --> 12:21.539
Lucas says our ride is waiting
and to hurry.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.181
And we'll be back before anyone
knows we're gone.

12:23.206 --> 12:24.208
Back from where?

12:24.210 --> 12:25.609
I don't know back from where.
I've already...

12:25.611 --> 12:27.945
Well, so far,
‭their stories are matching up

12:27.947 --> 12:29.346
to all the notes the FBI made.

12:29.348 --> 12:32.750
Well, they've had eight days to practice.

12:32.752 --> 12:33.984
Who was your ride?

12:33.986 --> 12:35.386
If I knew, I'd tell you.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.521
Well, we started running
to this, like, green curb

12:37.523 --> 12:39.623
between the museum and science center.

12:39.625 --> 12:43.060
And Lucas was just laughing
and saying, "Check this out."

12:43.288 --> 12:45.296
And it's a black limo,

12:45.298 --> 12:46.764
and Lucas just had this look on his face

12:46.766 --> 12:48.232
like, "How dope is this?"

12:48.234 --> 12:49.800
And he says it's gonna take us
someplace awesome,

12:49.802 --> 12:50.835
so we get in.

12:50.837 --> 12:52.436
"Someplace awesome." Where?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.071
Still no idea.

12:54.073 --> 12:56.407
Because then we're inside
the limo, and...

12:56.409 --> 12:59.677
You know that thing between
where we sit and the driver,

12:59.679 --> 13:00.978
- the partition?
- ‭Mm-hmm.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.546
Well, suddenly, that thing comes down,

13:02.548 --> 13:05.216
and a dude's arm comes in
from the driver's seat,

13:05.218 --> 13:06.717
and he has some kind of mask on his face.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.019
And he's spraying stuff at us
from a hose.

13:09.021 --> 13:10.588
It stung and tasted chemically.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.323
What kind of chemical?

13:12.325 --> 13:13.724
I don't know,
but we... we tried to get out,

13:13.726 --> 13:15.359
but the doors were locked.

13:15.361 --> 13:17.056
And the next thing I know,
Ryan went down.

13:17.058 --> 13:19.363
- How the hell could they still...
- And then I went down...

13:19.365 --> 13:21.665
- ...not know where they were going?
- ...and I guess Lucas went down.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.300
And I was thinking...

13:23.302 --> 13:25.569
The last thing I was thinking,
"We're dead."

13:25.571 --> 13:27.538
- And then what?
- And then I woke up.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.672
Could've been days later.

13:28.674 --> 13:30.508
It was pitch black. I was on the floor.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.675
But then, after a second,

13:31.677 --> 13:32.943
I realized I wasn't actually
on the floor.

13:32.945 --> 13:34.345
I was on the ground.

13:34.347 --> 13:37.047
I was outside,
and Miguel was just shaking me

13:37.049 --> 13:38.482
because he woke up first.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.718
We waited till sunrise,
and then we realized

13:40.720 --> 13:42.753
we were in the middle
of the desert somewhere.

13:42.755 --> 13:45.356
We looked for the limo,
but we couldn't find it,

13:45.358 --> 13:48.092
so we started walking, like,
looking for a road or something.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.194
It was brutal. So hot.

13:50.196 --> 13:51.562
Our throats were just burning

13:51.564 --> 13:53.164
'cause of the desert
or the chemical stuff.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.698
I don't know. It was just brutal.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.033
And where'd you walk?

13:56.035 --> 13:57.434
Just picked a way. Found some house.

13:57.436 --> 13:59.303
They gave us water,
but that barely helped.

13:59.305 --> 14:01.005
And after they found out
we were Americans,

14:01.007 --> 14:02.573
we figured out we were in Mexico.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.642
And after they called
the policía, it only got worse.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.210
They went through our backpacks,

14:06.212 --> 14:07.545
and they said they found drugs,

14:07.547 --> 14:09.513
but I never touched oxy in my life.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.515
And I tried to explain, but I don't know

14:11.517 --> 14:14.084
if they wouldn't listen
or they couldn't understand.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.319
You don't speak Spanish?

14:15.321 --> 14:16.420
I understand it pretty well,

14:16.422 --> 14:18.689
but, no, I-I don't speak it.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.625
Look, where are my parents? Are they...

14:21.627 --> 14:23.194
Are we in trouble?

14:23.196 --> 14:24.995
Because you're undocumented?

14:26.365 --> 14:28.132
Does the whole world know about this?

14:30.686 --> 14:32.436
My dad must be pissed.

14:32.438 --> 14:34.373
Well, ‭it's not word for word...

14:34.375 --> 14:36.390
...but it's in the same vicinity.

14:36.392 --> 14:38.943
The biggest bullshit story
I've ever heard.

14:38.945 --> 14:41.117
You tell Sanchez to shift gears.

14:41.119 --> 14:44.148
I mean, they had to have known
where Lucas was taking them.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.683
Or thought they knew.

14:45.685 --> 14:49.320
Lieutenant Provenza wants you
to start the pushback.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.622
Miguel, I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

14:51.624 --> 14:52.656
That's a camera.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.625
People in another room are watching us,

14:54.627 --> 14:56.460
and they're also watching detectives

14:56.462 --> 14:58.095
interview your friend Ryan.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.496
And you see this in my ear?

14:59.498 --> 15:01.165
That's so they can let me know

15:01.167 --> 15:03.801
whether or not yours
and Ryan's stories match up.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.302
And guess what I just heard.

15:05.304 --> 15:06.203
What?

15:06.205 --> 15:08.339
Ryan said the drugs belong to you.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.473
What?

15:09.475 --> 15:10.904
No. I don't believe it.

15:10.906 --> 15:13.077
Think of it as a game of "Pin
the Tail on the Dreamer Kid"

15:13.079 --> 15:16.513
who's about to get deported back
to Mexico for drug trafficking.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.048
No, Ryan wouldn't say that.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.817
Somebody did this to us, and I know who.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.386
That racist jerk who lives
next to Miguel... Marvin.

15:22.388 --> 15:25.689
Miguel thinks he did this.
Marvin hates us.

15:25.691 --> 15:27.358
Can't trip 'em up.

15:27.415 --> 15:29.927
- Look, you guys, look.
- They might even be telling the truth.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.539
What about ol' Marv?

15:31.541 --> 15:33.497
How you coming
‭with his immigrant directory?

15:33.499 --> 15:35.132
Well, we're still working through it.

15:35.134 --> 15:36.567
Marvin finally made bail,

15:36.569 --> 15:38.369
and the FBI didn't charge him
with anything else,

15:38.371 --> 15:39.803
so they really don't think he's involved

15:39.805 --> 15:41.105
with any kidnapping, either.

15:41.549 --> 15:44.141
Ye gods. Tao, it's the parents.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.305
Where's Ryan?

15:45.307 --> 15:48.312
Uh, we were just about to call you.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.281
Uh, Ryan and Miguel are undergoing

15:50.283 --> 15:51.949
routine questioning with the police.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.285
If I don't see Miguel in one
minute, I'm calling a lawyer.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.319
Look, we're just trying to help.

15:55.321 --> 15:56.920
If you want to call lawyers,

15:56.922 --> 15:58.322
then we'll arrest your kids,

15:58.324 --> 16:00.391
and you can see them in court tomorrow.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.059
Or...

16:02.061 --> 16:05.296
Or you could just sit and relax

16:05.298 --> 16:07.765
while we finish our initial review,

16:07.767 --> 16:11.435
and then we will arrange for each of you

16:11.437 --> 16:14.171
to have a very short visit with your kid.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.208
Mom, Dad, I'm so sorry.

16:18.210 --> 16:19.476
No. No. Don't worry about sorry.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.011
Well, now maybe we'll get someplace.

16:21.013 --> 16:22.646
We don't care.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.749
We were just so afraid that maybe...

16:25.751 --> 16:27.418
Oh, thank God.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.486
Thank God, baby. Thank God.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.455
Hey, hey, no, look.
We're just happy you're okay.

16:31.457 --> 16:33.991
No, I-I'm not okay. I'm not.

16:36.228 --> 16:37.728
The police want
to send us back to Mexico.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.763
Y-You don't have to worry
about that, either.

16:39.765 --> 16:41.065
We have rights.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.166
- This is our home.
- ‭No.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.767
No, not "us" as in you and me.

16:43.769 --> 16:45.803
Uh, "us" as in me and Ryan,

16:45.805 --> 16:48.038
because Mexican police found drugs on us,

16:48.040 --> 16:49.306
but they weren't our drugs.

16:49.308 --> 16:51.275
You expect me to believe that?

16:51.277 --> 16:53.777
You don't know
‭where Lucas was taking you,

16:53.779 --> 16:55.079
and you wake up days later

16:55.081 --> 16:57.414
in Mexico with drugs in your...

16:57.416 --> 17:00.084
I swear, Mom. They planted
all that stuff on us.

17:00.878 --> 17:02.353
Oh, great.

17:02.355 --> 17:05.222
Lawyer. Ryan, lawyer, okay?

17:05.223 --> 17:07.391
- Don't say anything more
- Ian, you wait outside.

17:07.393 --> 17:08.791
Absolutely not. He's my son, too.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.594
Yeah? Well, a lawyer
will only make him look guilty.

17:10.596 --> 17:12.496
- Are you insane? That's not...
- No, you're insane

17:12.498 --> 17:14.131
for thinking you should even be here.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.099
Daniella, there is no logic in
what you're saying at all, okay?

17:16.102 --> 17:19.136
Ryan, my man, listen to me.
You have a right to an attorney.

17:19.137 --> 17:20.304
Okay? ‭Would you guys stop?!

17:20.306 --> 17:21.505
And quit blaming me for this!

17:21.507 --> 17:23.140
I didn't kidnap myself.

17:23.142 --> 17:24.641
Aha. Now, this could get interesting.

17:24.643 --> 17:27.044
No? Then who did? Who?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.444
Who... Who would kidnap you?

17:28.446 --> 17:29.747
No one would've kidnapped you

17:29.749 --> 17:31.281
if you'd kept with the field trip.

17:31.283 --> 17:32.983
Why didn't you stay at the museum, huh?

17:32.985 --> 17:34.084
No, a kidnapping involves a ransom,

17:34.086 --> 17:35.552
and this may be hard to hear,

17:35.554 --> 17:37.988
but you ain't got nobody
to pay anything to get you back,

17:37.990 --> 17:39.623
unless, uh, Hector's friends,

17:39.625 --> 17:41.024
they had it out for you or something.

17:41.026 --> 17:42.819
- Is that it?
- I don't want to talk to you guys.

17:42.821 --> 17:44.395
I want to talk to Father Jonas.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.943
Neither of you guys know
what happened to me.

17:45.945 --> 17:47.199
Neither of you guys care.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.933
You. You!

17:49.935 --> 17:51.335
Whoa. Me. Me!

17:51.337 --> 17:53.890
Who would you blame if I wasn't around?!

17:54.601 --> 17:56.940
Bitch. Ugh!

17:56.942 --> 17:58.475
Boy, did I ever choose the wrong day

17:58.477 --> 17:59.843
to pick up a girl on the beach.

17:59.845 --> 18:03.714
We followed up with Mr. Nuñez
about his, uh, date.

18:03.716 --> 18:06.817
Uh, Julio called the young lady
and confirmed

18:06.819 --> 18:08.285
that he was with her

18:08.287 --> 18:09.920
the afternoon the boys went missing.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.588
And that's about it.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.758
So, Ryan wanted to talk to Father Jonas,

18:14.760 --> 18:17.628
but Miguel didn't mention Father Jonas

18:17.630 --> 18:19.496
- at all, did he?
- ‭No, ma'am.

18:19.498 --> 18:21.698
Sharon, the doctor wanted you to rest.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.735
I'm... I'm home. I'm sitting.

18:25.254 --> 18:27.070
Okay, I'm done.

18:27.072 --> 18:30.607
Um, Buzz, will you tell
Lieutenant Provenza

18:30.609 --> 18:33.010
that I recommend arresting these boys?

18:33.012 --> 18:34.211
Mm. For what?

18:34.213 --> 18:35.446
The murder of Lucas Garza.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.781
Oh. Uh, o-okay. Sure.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.983
And, Rusty, if you'd call Andrea

18:39.985 --> 18:43.187
and ask her to hold off
arraigning Miguel and Ryan

18:43.189 --> 18:44.354
until tomorrow, please.

18:44.356 --> 18:46.857
- So they're guilty.
- We'll see.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.059
Feel better, Commander.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.571
Thank you, Buzz.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.867
Oh. I'm...

18:56.869 --> 19:01.772
I'm just going to write
an e-mail to Lieutenant Provenza

19:01.774 --> 19:03.207
about this little idea I have,

19:03.209 --> 19:04.518
and then I am done.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.310
And then can you tell me

19:06.312 --> 19:09.146
what the doctor said about everything?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.381
Yes. Everything.

19:41.572 --> 19:42.804
Are you done?

19:43.951 --> 19:46.142
'Cause I'm getting more stressed
by the second.

19:49.514 --> 19:52.782
Hi.

19:52.784 --> 19:56.519
So, uh... what did the doctor say,

19:56.521 --> 19:59.021
I mean besides, come home
and get some rest?

19:59.023 --> 20:00.956
Rest from what?

20:00.958 --> 20:01.957
I'm sorry, Andy.

20:01.959 --> 20:03.425
I just needed a little time in there

20:03.427 --> 20:05.361
to sort... sort out my feelings.

20:05.363 --> 20:08.731
So, the good news is we have a diagnosis.

20:08.733 --> 20:12.320
The bad news is
‭I have a heart condition.

20:13.404 --> 20:14.670
Like mine?

20:14.672 --> 20:17.439
No, no, I have something
called cardiomyopathy.

20:17.441 --> 20:18.641
Oh, well, that's...

20:18.643 --> 20:19.975
I mean, ‭that's kind of a broad term.

20:19.977 --> 20:21.699
I mean, ‭it could be nothing, right?

20:21.701 --> 20:23.122
Well, it's not nothing

20:23.447 --> 20:26.882
because it's a virus
attacking the pericardium,

20:26.884 --> 20:29.051
which is the outer lining of my heart.

20:29.053 --> 20:33.255
Now, the infection could
remain in its current state,

20:33.257 --> 20:35.457
clear up, or develop.

20:35.459 --> 20:38.460
And if things worsen,
there are other steps.

20:38.462 --> 20:40.996
There's surgery, um, transplant.

20:40.998 --> 20:43.265
- Transplant?!
- ‭Oh, no, ‭we're not even there yet.

20:43.267 --> 20:44.867
We're not even close. Andy.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.136
In fact, I feel better already.

20:47.138 --> 20:49.607
But until I know more,

20:50.508 --> 20:54.043
I think we should postpone the wedding.

20:54.045 --> 20:55.945
It's not fair to you.

20:55.947 --> 20:57.012
Absolutely not.

20:57.014 --> 20:58.447
You think I'd let anything get in the way

20:58.449 --> 20:59.701
of becoming your husband?

20:59.703 --> 21:02.218
I want you to just think
about this just for a second.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.913
I don't need a second.

21:07.124 --> 21:08.524
All right, Sharon.

21:08.526 --> 21:10.586
I never told you this.

21:11.162 --> 21:15.097
But when I was sick
‭and you helped me through it...

21:15.099 --> 21:16.133
Mm.

21:17.435 --> 21:19.635
...no one's ever treated me that well.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.171
And I don't know if I deserve it,

21:22.173 --> 21:25.101
and I don't know
‭why you care about me so much,

21:25.893 --> 21:32.191
but it's all I can do right now
to wait until the ceremony...

21:34.452 --> 21:37.353
to call you my wife
and to be your husband.

21:37.355 --> 21:38.888
And if we're not gonna let

21:38.890 --> 21:41.090
myheart get in the way of that,

21:41.092 --> 21:44.793
then, uh, we're not gonna
let yours stop us, either.

21:44.795 --> 21:45.997
- But what if I...
- All right, all right.

21:45.999 --> 21:48.797
The only change we're gonna make
is no honeymoon.

21:48.799 --> 21:52.902
We don't go to Ireland
until we understand

21:52.904 --> 21:56.739
exactly what it is you're up against.

21:57.722 --> 22:01.690
Unless y-you changed your mind about us.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.480
Have you changed your mind?

22:04.482 --> 22:07.650
No. Andy no.

22:07.652 --> 22:12.254
I love you so, s-so much.

22:12.256 --> 22:14.323
I just...

22:14.325 --> 22:19.324
As long as you understand
what I am dealing with here.

22:19.326 --> 22:21.130
Whatwe'redealing with, okay?

22:21.615 --> 22:23.230
- Okay.
- ‭All right.

22:23.232 --> 22:25.768
So, let's start from where the doctor

22:25.770 --> 22:27.970
asked me to leave the room.

22:29.106 --> 22:33.709
And, uh, you try to remember,
word for word,

22:33.711 --> 22:35.978
what he said to you, okay?

22:35.980 --> 22:37.346
Word for word.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.182
Everything I hear
will be completely confidential.

22:40.184 --> 22:42.618
To you, Ryan Rojas might be a suspect,

22:42.620 --> 22:43.852
but, to me, he's a patient who survived

22:43.854 --> 22:45.454
a very traumatic experience.

22:45.456 --> 22:47.923
And as a psychologist, my first
order of business is...

22:47.925 --> 22:52.094
These boys want us to believe
that they ran off with Lucas

22:52.096 --> 22:56.131
with absolutely no idea
about where they were going.

22:56.133 --> 22:58.367
Now, I don't know
‭if you know this, doctor,

22:58.369 --> 23:02.304
but teenagers tend to lie
when they screw up.

23:02.306 --> 23:03.438
So unlike adults.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.341
It's a lie ‭he's sticking to, Lieutenant,

23:05.343 --> 23:07.937
and I'm out on a limb
charging these boys with murder.

23:07.939 --> 23:09.192
Do you have any evidence?

23:09.194 --> 23:10.754
Oh, details, details.

23:10.754 --> 23:13.321
Without details,
‭the defense's star witness

23:13.323 --> 23:14.823
is going to be Dr. Morales, who will say

23:14.825 --> 23:17.926
Lucas Garza died
‭of complications from diabetes.

23:17.928 --> 23:19.527
- But...
- I know. I know.

23:19.529 --> 23:22.497
The killer or killers
may have starved Lucas

23:22.499 --> 23:25.166
to make his murder seem
like natural causes.

23:25.168 --> 23:26.768
The boys were found with opioids.

23:26.770 --> 23:30.763
But you don't have alibis
for Dr. Garza or Father Jonas,

23:30.765 --> 23:33.509
who's proving as difficult
to find as the boys were.

23:33.511 --> 23:34.509
And, frankly,

23:34.511 --> 23:36.701
I am worried that,
‭with the commander out sick,

23:36.703 --> 23:38.146
there isn't a real plan here.

23:38.148 --> 23:39.848
I find that offensive, Hobbs.

23:39.850 --> 23:43.818
I have been a detective for 40 years.

23:43.820 --> 23:46.621
I know exactly what I'm doing.

23:46.623 --> 23:50.191
Besides all that,
‭this is the commander's plan,

23:50.193 --> 23:54.963
including having Dr. Joe
talk to Ryan about his issues.

23:54.965 --> 23:56.031
What issues?

23:56.033 --> 23:59.200
His stepfather fell off the balcony
of their condo and died.

23:59.202 --> 24:00.635
Or maybe he was pushed.

24:00.637 --> 24:03.271
And Ryan's natural father has an alibi,

24:03.273 --> 24:05.440
but he's still a sociopath.

24:05.442 --> 24:06.941
And Kelly Garret said
Ryan's only just starting

24:06.943 --> 24:08.176
to talk about being gay

24:08.178 --> 24:09.878
and that he has a crush on Miguel.

24:09.880 --> 24:12.514
Wait. Let's assume
‭what Ryan told us is true.

24:12.516 --> 24:13.882
He's sprayed with a chemical agent,

24:13.884 --> 24:15.216
loses consciousness,

24:15.218 --> 24:16.451
wakes up ‭in the middle of a desert,

24:16.453 --> 24:17.685
is thrown in a Mexican jail

24:17.687 --> 24:19.220
because drugs were planted on him,

24:19.222 --> 24:22.323
is rescued only to find one
of his best friends is dead.

24:22.325 --> 24:24.559
All that spells a week of severe trauma.

24:24.561 --> 24:25.960
So what's another day?

24:25.962 --> 24:27.695
And now we should assume
that it didn't go down

24:27.697 --> 24:29.330
like Miguel and Ryan said

24:29.332 --> 24:31.132
because they conveniently don't remember

24:31.134 --> 24:32.567
anything that happened

24:32.569 --> 24:34.302
between the time
‭they disappeared and woke up.

24:34.304 --> 24:35.737
And they can't even explain

24:35.739 --> 24:37.372
why they were leaving the field trip,

24:37.374 --> 24:39.642
beyond everything being Lucas' idea.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.376
Ah, Lucas.

24:41.378 --> 24:45.713
Lucas, who is conveniently dead.

24:45.715 --> 24:47.448
Doctor, that's why we need you

24:47.450 --> 24:50.084
to catch Ryan ‭in just one, little lie.

24:50.086 --> 24:51.486
That will give us...

24:51.488 --> 24:53.621
Lieutenant, my job is to talk
to this boy privately,

24:53.623 --> 24:55.890
no listening in,
‭and assess his mental fitness.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.792
It's your job to catch him in lies.

24:57.794 --> 25:00.829
Sorry. Sorry.
‭I was pushing the envelope.

25:00.831 --> 25:03.798
So, uh, why don't you set up
in the commander's office,

25:03.800 --> 25:06.211
and we will send send Ryan in?

25:07.179 --> 25:08.138
Julio.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.405
Daniella Rojas
‭is in Interview Room Number 1

25:10.407 --> 25:11.873
like you wanted, Lieutenant.

25:11.875 --> 25:13.508
I printed up some information

25:13.510 --> 25:15.810
on witness and victim's rights
for her to read.

25:15.812 --> 25:19.647
Patrol's outside the door,
so she's not going anywhere.

25:19.649 --> 25:21.716
Good. Good, Julio.
Just be ready to grab her.

25:21.718 --> 25:24.819
Sykes, why don't you bring Ryan in?

25:26.133 --> 25:30.325
And now we'll see
if the commander's plan works.

25:32.295 --> 25:33.695
What the hell is this about?

25:33.697 --> 25:34.996
Are you another cop or what?

25:34.998 --> 25:36.763
- FBI again?
- ‭No.

25:36.765 --> 25:38.666
My name's Dr. Joe Bowman.

25:38.668 --> 25:40.034
You can call me Dr. Joe if you want.

25:40.036 --> 25:41.469
I've already been looked at by doctors.

25:41.471 --> 25:43.104
He's a different kind of doctor, Ryan.

25:43.106 --> 25:44.339
A psychologist.

25:44.943 --> 25:46.941
Let us know when you're done.

25:47.791 --> 25:50.144
Okay, Buzz. Far as we can go.

25:50.908 --> 25:52.614
Are we really allowed
to be watching this?

25:52.616 --> 25:54.449
The law says no listening.

25:54.451 --> 25:56.417
It doesn't say anything about watching.

25:56.419 --> 25:57.886
Keep it muted, and we're fine.

25:57.888 --> 25:59.754
But won't Dr. Joe be angry?

25:59.756 --> 26:01.456
Buzz, we're doing this
for Dr. Joe's safety.

26:01.458 --> 26:05.660
He's in there with a murder
suspect, and he's unarmed.

26:06.006 --> 26:07.662
So, you're really not a cop?

26:07.664 --> 26:09.163
You have to say if I ask, don't you?

26:09.165 --> 26:10.598
That's only on TV,

26:10.600 --> 26:13.501
but have you ever seen a cop
in a sweater vest?

26:14.771 --> 26:17.038
Everything you tell me is privileged.

26:17.393 --> 26:18.573
Do you know that term?

26:18.575 --> 26:21.267
Yeah. ‭Like what I say in confession.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.645
But I've already answered every
question people could think of.

26:23.647 --> 26:26.014
Did they ask how you feel?

26:30.754 --> 26:32.520
Ryan, let's start with Lucas.

26:32.522 --> 26:34.289
One of your very best friends is dead.

26:35.744 --> 26:37.325
How are you holding up?

26:38.288 --> 26:39.327
Honestly?

26:39.748 --> 26:40.728
It's...

26:40.730 --> 26:42.196
It's hard to believe.

26:42.198 --> 26:43.627
I mean...

26:44.701 --> 26:46.834
sometimes, I think it's true.

26:46.836 --> 26:48.870
Sometimes, I think it just
couldn't have happened.

26:48.872 --> 26:50.926
I can't...

26:53.310 --> 26:55.410
Lucas not being here anymore...

26:58.548 --> 27:00.581
Dr. Joe might be making headway.

27:00.583 --> 27:01.716
Might be.

27:01.718 --> 27:03.151
Yeah, well, whatever.

27:03.153 --> 27:05.553
I'm losing interest in this silent movie.

27:05.555 --> 27:06.955
Have you guys finished

27:06.957 --> 27:09.991
with Marvin's
illegal-immigrant directory?

27:09.993 --> 27:12.393
Uh, yeah, cross-referenced
all the crime reports

27:12.395 --> 27:15.430
with all of the addresses
that Marvin kept tabs on.

27:15.432 --> 27:16.631
At half the locations,

27:16.633 --> 27:17.966
there have been acts of vandalism...

27:17.968 --> 27:20.201
uh, rocks through windows, slashed tires.

27:20.203 --> 27:22.537
Well, someone could argue that's random.

27:22.539 --> 27:24.739
Anything suggesting hate crimes?

27:24.741 --> 27:26.441
Well, that depends on how you interpret

27:26.443 --> 27:27.675
"get out of my country"

27:27.677 --> 27:29.143
spray-painted on your front door,

27:29.145 --> 27:32.180
which appeared at 31 different addresses.

27:33.283 --> 27:34.632
- Sykes.
- ‭Hmm?

27:34.634 --> 27:35.683
What are you thinking?

27:36.305 --> 27:38.086
The whole drug-trafficking issue.

27:38.088 --> 27:39.320
Um, I just checked.

27:39.322 --> 27:42.724
Lucas had no opioids hidden
in his backpack anywhere.

27:43.312 --> 27:45.827
I just thought we were going
for a surprise, you know,

27:45.829 --> 27:47.662
like we've done a billion times before,

27:47.664 --> 27:49.797
just the three of us.

27:51.320 --> 27:54.068
We just trusted Lucas knew
what was going on.

27:56.506 --> 27:58.873
Where is everyone?

28:03.913 --> 28:06.529
I'm sure ‭they're not listening in.

28:06.531 --> 28:09.050
That would be so against the rules.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.553
Lieutenant.

28:12.555 --> 28:13.855
Commander.

28:13.857 --> 28:15.857
Oh, everything's off. All by the book.

28:15.859 --> 28:17.258
Just watching.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.726
Not illegal.

28:18.728 --> 28:20.595
So, have you learned anything?

28:20.597 --> 28:21.829
No. No. Not yet.

28:21.831 --> 28:24.232
But, Commander, uh, welcome back.

28:24.853 --> 28:27.135
Sometimes a crime...
which is what happened to you...

28:27.137 --> 28:30.638
is unrelated ‭to our daily lives, random.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.875
And sometimes crimes happen
inside families,

28:33.877 --> 28:37.245
like with your stepdad,
for instance... Hector.

28:37.247 --> 28:39.347
He hit you, right?

28:39.349 --> 28:40.744
He hurt you?

28:41.912 --> 28:43.184
Yeah. He hit me.

28:43.186 --> 28:44.719
And that's a crime,

28:44.721 --> 28:46.587
though he may have said
it was your fault,

28:46.589 --> 28:48.489
that he was beating you for a reason.

28:48.491 --> 28:49.924
Is that what happened?

28:49.926 --> 28:52.060
Why did Hector say he was hurting you?

28:52.062 --> 28:55.696
He said it was because of
the way I am, things I did.

28:57.135 --> 28:59.300
You think Hector...

28:59.302 --> 29:00.835
You think Hector had
something to do with this?

29:00.837 --> 29:02.703
I mean, what happened to Hector?

29:02.705 --> 29:04.505
Is that why Lucas died?

29:04.507 --> 29:07.341
I don't know. Is it?

29:10.399 --> 29:11.813
You guys need to put
a sign out here or something.

29:11.815 --> 29:13.548
Looks like ‭you're taking the day off.

29:13.550 --> 29:15.383
And I have news.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.320
Do you ever talk about Hector
and what he was doing to you

29:20.117 --> 29:22.957
to anyone, somebody at school maybe?

29:26.623 --> 29:29.864
I told Father Jonas
‭Hector punched me a few times.

29:31.753 --> 29:33.801
But I also said reporting it
would only make things worse.

29:33.803 --> 29:35.336
Because of Hector's gang connections?

29:35.338 --> 29:40.721
He said... Hector said if I told on him,

29:41.244 --> 29:44.516
him and his friends would
take care of me for good...

29:47.144 --> 29:49.450
and my mom.

29:53.156 --> 29:56.390
That had to be scary stuff
to handle on your own.

29:56.392 --> 29:57.758
How did you manage it?

30:04.234 --> 30:07.444
The substance found on Lucas
Garza's shirt was chloroform?

30:07.446 --> 30:08.544
That's right.

30:08.546 --> 30:10.138
Once you told me the boys
were sprayed with something, I made...

30:10.140 --> 30:11.939
‭No, no, no, theyclaimed
that they were sprayed.

30:11.941 --> 30:14.175
- We have no proof of that.
- Whatever.

30:14.177 --> 30:16.611
I made a list of fast-acting anesthetics

30:16.613 --> 30:18.179
that could be delivered via aerosol

30:18.181 --> 30:21.516
and found a match from that list
on Lucas' shirt... chloroform.

30:21.518 --> 30:22.511
Yes, but the issue is that...

30:22.513 --> 30:24.118
But, doctor, all that confirms
is that Lucas

30:24.120 --> 30:25.386
was sprayed with chloroform.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.088
We can't test Ryan and Miguel's clothes

30:27.090 --> 30:28.322
because they were left somewhere

30:28.324 --> 30:29.857
in the Rosarito Police Department.

30:29.859 --> 30:31.192
Detective Paige,

30:31.194 --> 30:33.634
thank you for your boundless enthusiasm.

30:33.636 --> 30:35.730
Doctor, also, the boys complained

30:35.732 --> 30:37.865
about burning throats.

30:37.867 --> 30:39.500
Chloroform would not do that at all.

30:39.502 --> 30:42.837
Now, supposing that
their ridiculous story was true

30:42.839 --> 30:46.174
and we could find this fantasy limo,

30:46.176 --> 30:48.476
would chloroform still be present?

30:48.478 --> 30:51.679
If you ran across the limo
within the next 600 days, yes.

30:51.681 --> 30:54.081
And, personally, I think
the limo is real.

30:54.083 --> 30:55.283
Holy crap!

30:55.285 --> 30:57.051
It says here oxycodone
was in Lucas' blood?

30:57.053 --> 30:59.687
Ohh. Spoiler alert.

30:59.689 --> 31:01.422
But, yes, based on the fact

31:01.424 --> 31:04.125
that the other boys
were found with opioids,

31:04.127 --> 31:07.562
I screened Lucas' blood for oxy,
and there it was.

31:07.564 --> 31:08.930
Lethal amount?

31:08.932 --> 31:10.631
No, Lucas still died from ketoacidosis,

31:10.633 --> 31:12.200
but there was more than enough oxy

31:12.202 --> 31:15.203
to keep him unconscious
after the chloroform wore off.

31:15.205 --> 31:17.371
Which could make the drugs
a contributory cause of death.

31:17.373 --> 31:21.042
Maybe Dr. Garza had another stash
of pills somewhere Lucas found.

31:21.044 --> 31:22.310
Uh, Lieutenant, you wanted to know

31:22.312 --> 31:23.644
if Ryan got really emotional.

31:23.646 --> 31:27.014
Oh. Wonderful, Buzz. Thank you.

31:27.016 --> 31:30.384
And I will text Julio that he's on.

31:30.386 --> 31:31.778
Daniella.

31:31.780 --> 31:34.222
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but your son needs you, ma'am.

31:38.895 --> 31:41.229
Oh. Commander.

31:41.231 --> 31:42.663
I hope you didn't rush back
for my assessment.

31:42.665 --> 31:43.898
I'm nowhere near done.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.900
Well, your conversation with Ryan

31:45.902 --> 31:48.002
is not the one
‭we're interested in, doctor.

31:48.004 --> 31:49.437
You were eavesdropping?

31:49.439 --> 31:50.705
We just watched.

31:50.707 --> 31:53.040
Well, but now, we're going to listen.

31:53.042 --> 31:53.841
Buzz?

31:59.082 --> 32:01.415
I'll be standing outside the door.

32:01.417 --> 32:03.155
Knock if you need me.

32:05.221 --> 32:07.722
They won't stop asking
all these questions.

32:07.724 --> 32:09.156
They want to know everything.

32:09.158 --> 32:11.892
Well, w-what do you mean, everything?

32:11.894 --> 32:13.494
Okay, boyo. You're all worked up.

32:13.496 --> 32:15.229
Now just let it out.

32:15.231 --> 32:16.697
You used me ‭to get Ryan emotional enough

32:16.699 --> 32:18.065
to break down like this?

32:18.067 --> 32:19.767
I'm not here to loosen
the jar for you, Lieutenant.

32:19.769 --> 32:22.303
You can get back to your
assessment in a moment, doctor.

32:22.305 --> 32:24.905
Tell me what, Ryan? Tell me what?

32:24.907 --> 32:26.407
Oh, God.

32:26.409 --> 32:28.175
I'm going to hell. I'm going to hell.

32:28.177 --> 32:29.677
- I want to talk to Father Jonas.
- ‭Okay, okay.

32:29.679 --> 32:31.876
- I want to talk to Father Jonas.
- ‭Okay, okay.

32:31.878 --> 32:34.115
We all want to talk to Father Jonas, kid.

32:34.117 --> 32:36.384
Okay. Listen.

32:36.855 --> 32:39.353
He's coming back to L.A. tomorrow.

32:39.355 --> 32:41.088
He's worried about you, Ryan.

32:41.090 --> 32:42.556
Whoa. That's news.

32:42.558 --> 32:44.458
I-I'll find a way for you two to talk.

32:44.460 --> 32:46.961
Our priest was in touch
with Daniella Rojas?

32:46.963 --> 32:49.297
We need to find Jonas before she does.

32:49.299 --> 32:52.099
Cover airports, bus stations,
and train stations.

32:52.101 --> 32:54.302
And given the confirmed use of opioids,

32:54.304 --> 32:57.538
I think it's time to release
Lucas' body to his parents

32:57.540 --> 32:59.189
with the autopsy report.

32:59.191 --> 33:00.313
If you're all through,

33:00.315 --> 33:01.842
I'd like to finish helping out the boy.

33:01.844 --> 33:03.944
Of course, doctor.

33:03.946 --> 33:06.218
That's why you're here.

33:11.020 --> 33:14.588
Opioids in Lucas Garza's blood.

33:14.590 --> 33:16.686
But not in his backpack.

33:24.495 --> 33:26.581
So it's cardio... cardio what?

33:26.629 --> 33:28.229
Cardiomyopathy.

33:28.231 --> 33:29.597
...myopathy.

33:29.599 --> 33:32.175
The disease varies from person to person,

33:32.177 --> 33:34.101
so not everything you read
online is going to...

33:34.103 --> 33:35.770
"The disease can have no symptoms

33:35.772 --> 33:37.138
and require no treatment

33:37.140 --> 33:38.706
or develop quickly
‭with serious complications."

33:38.708 --> 33:41.008
How do we know which version you have?

33:41.010 --> 33:43.511
We don't. Not yet. But we will.

33:43.513 --> 33:47.014
Dr. Jacobs is a very experienced
cardiologist,

33:47.016 --> 33:54.088
and he told me that most people
die with this disease,

33:54.113 --> 33:55.879
not from this disease.

33:55.881 --> 33:57.881
Well, what can I do to help?

33:59.618 --> 34:02.686
Accept the full
undercover security detail

34:02.688 --> 34:04.688
that the L.A.P.D. is recommending.

34:04.690 --> 34:09.025
It would take a lot of stress
off my heart, I am sure.

34:09.027 --> 34:09.993
Wow.

34:09.995 --> 34:12.629
I mean, I-I know it's your job

34:12.630 --> 34:15.165
to make people feel guilty
enough to take a deal,

34:15.167 --> 34:17.100
but wow.

34:20.039 --> 34:23.473
All right. I will accept
the security detail,

34:23.475 --> 34:27.411
but I still want
‭the concealed-weapon permit.

34:30.549 --> 34:32.916
The gun is your last resort.

34:32.918 --> 34:36.987
Your first option
is your security detail.

34:36.989 --> 34:39.623
Thank you for agreeing to this.

34:39.625 --> 34:41.525
Means a lot to me.

34:41.527 --> 34:43.659
Um, do you remember, Rusty,

34:43.661 --> 34:47.063
that we invited Gus to the wedding?

34:47.065 --> 34:49.733
Oh, God, he's... He won't come.

34:49.735 --> 34:51.601
Well, he R.S.V.P.'d yes.

34:51.603 --> 34:53.904
That was two months ago. He's not coming.

34:53.906 --> 34:56.340
We... We're not even talking
to each other.

34:56.342 --> 34:58.442
You don't think that Gus is
coming to the wedding, do you?

34:58.444 --> 35:00.244
He ordered the salmon.

35:00.246 --> 35:03.413
Uh, Ryan Rojas and Miguel Diaz
are about to be arraigned.

35:03.415 --> 35:05.148
- Do you want to be there?
- Yes.

35:05.150 --> 35:07.417
Uh, Mom.

35:07.419 --> 35:08.685
My phone.

35:08.687 --> 35:10.988
Oh, my goodness. Sorry.

35:10.990 --> 35:13.890
We will, um, talk about this later, okay?

35:13.892 --> 35:15.859
I don't want you to worry about me.

35:15.861 --> 35:18.061
Things will work out
the way they're meant to be.

35:18.475 --> 35:19.768
Okay?

35:27.673 --> 35:29.773
Why do we have to sign Miranda rights

35:29.775 --> 35:31.341
to pick up our son's body?

35:31.343 --> 35:32.709
Short answer? Because lawyers.

35:32.711 --> 35:35.545
You're no stranger
to bureaucracy, doctor.

35:35.547 --> 35:37.581
Insurance companies probably force you

35:37.583 --> 35:39.549
to jump through more hoops than we do.

35:39.551 --> 35:41.618
- Really?
- ‭Yes. I'm sorry.

35:41.620 --> 35:43.954
In addition, we need you to sign a form

35:43.956 --> 35:46.256
acknowledging that you've read
the autopsy report,

35:46.258 --> 35:47.858
which is here.

35:47.860 --> 35:50.727
Are there... photographs in there

35:50.729 --> 35:52.529
- because I-I don't think that...
- No pictures.

35:52.531 --> 35:54.698
The D.A. spared us that.
Just stuff you have to read.

35:54.700 --> 35:56.233
Happy to be thrown under the bus
if it helps.

35:56.235 --> 36:00.137
Why do Miguel and Ryan
say they're not guilty?

36:00.139 --> 36:01.171
I mean, you arrested them.

36:01.173 --> 36:03.006
You must have proof they did this.

36:03.008 --> 36:06.076
It may surprise you, but most
murderers plead not guilty.

36:06.078 --> 36:07.978
I don't even like seeing
Lucas' name in this.

36:07.980 --> 36:10.213
We're sorry, ma'am.
You're almost finished.

36:10.215 --> 36:11.648
All you have left

36:11.650 --> 36:14.084
is the lab report and the tox screen.

36:14.086 --> 36:16.153
Is that... ‭Is that really necessary?

36:16.155 --> 36:19.890
Unfortunately, we need to see
each of you complete a review.

36:19.892 --> 36:21.725
And then we need to fill out a form

36:21.727 --> 36:23.226
saying we witnessed the review,

36:23.228 --> 36:25.696
and if we don't do that,
well, it's just one big thing.

36:25.698 --> 36:27.297
W-Well, this... this can't be right.

36:27.299 --> 36:29.833
Why does it say that there was
oxycodone in Lucas' blood?

36:29.835 --> 36:31.435
Uh, Miguel and Ryan were found

36:31.437 --> 36:33.437
in possession of oxy in Mexico.

36:33.439 --> 36:36.006
Medical examiner screened
Lucas' blood for...

36:36.008 --> 36:37.040
They had oxy?

36:37.042 --> 36:38.909
I thought pot maybe, but they had oxy?

36:38.911 --> 36:40.477
Where did that get oxy from?

36:40.479 --> 36:41.778
- Where would they get it, huh?
- Hang on, Sara.

36:41.780 --> 36:42.946
Where would they get it?

36:42.948 --> 36:44.281
They... They didn't get it from me.

36:44.283 --> 36:45.682
Where would they get it?

36:45.684 --> 36:50.320
Sara, this is not the time
to have this conversation.

36:50.322 --> 36:51.955
- Oh, really?
- ‭Yes, really!

36:51.957 --> 36:54.858
Look. ‭I am 100 percent positive...

36:54.860 --> 36:57.394
- You can't be sure!
- Yes, I can because...

36:58.897 --> 37:02.366
Dr. Garza, is there something
we should know?

37:06.405 --> 37:07.871
They couldn't.

37:07.873 --> 37:11.921
They couldn't have taken the oxy
from me because...

37:13.465 --> 37:15.712
I know exactly how much I have.

37:16.384 --> 37:18.315
You have?

37:18.317 --> 37:19.955
You're using again?

37:19.957 --> 37:22.052
Yeah, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

37:22.054 --> 37:26.189
But, look, I-I'll tell you
exactly how much oxy I've...

37:26.191 --> 37:29.192
Don't look at me that way, Sara!
Let me finish! Okay?

37:29.194 --> 37:30.827
I'll check out how much oxy
I have put away

37:30.829 --> 37:32.796
and see if Lucas and his friends
have taken any of it.

37:32.798 --> 37:34.398
They haven't, but...

37:34.400 --> 37:36.833
I think we'd like to check out
that oxy with you, doctor.

37:36.835 --> 37:39.503
Go talk to my lawyer.

37:39.505 --> 37:40.971
Sara!

37:40.973 --> 37:43.039
Maybe ‭that's the way it happened.

37:43.041 --> 37:47.344
Miguel and Ryan use
‭Dr. Garza's oxy with Lucas.

37:47.346 --> 37:49.613
Lucas passes out,
‭can't give himself insulin,

37:49.615 --> 37:50.947
ends up dead.

37:50.949 --> 37:53.250
Now Miguel and Ryan try to cover it up.

37:53.252 --> 37:55.118
They panic, run off to Mexico,

37:55.120 --> 37:57.187
and make up this bullshit story.

37:57.189 --> 37:59.256
Or Lucas learned his dad was using again

37:59.258 --> 38:01.024
and threatened to tell his mother.

38:01.026 --> 38:04.661
Garza could lose his practice,
his marriage, all his money.

38:04.663 --> 38:06.563
He could lose his practice, yes.

38:06.565 --> 38:09.966
Well, does anyone think that's
enough to kill your own kid?

38:09.968 --> 38:11.335
Uh, I don't know

38:11.360 --> 38:12.202
how he got back into the country,

38:12.204 --> 38:15.071
but the SIS team surveilling
St. Joseph's reported

38:15.073 --> 38:16.673
Father Jonas just showed up.

38:16.675 --> 38:18.408
You want them to grab him?

38:21.407 --> 38:23.713
Father Jonas. Welcome home.

38:23.715 --> 38:26.316
You have a nice trip, asshole?

38:26.318 --> 38:27.884
Why would you speak to me
like that, Lieutenant?

38:27.886 --> 38:30.620
How about you ran
‭from a murder investigation?

38:30.622 --> 38:32.355
I left to protect my vows.

38:32.357 --> 38:34.558
Yeah, that's what all the single mothers

38:34.560 --> 38:35.926
you slept with said, too.

38:35.928 --> 38:37.928
You were very concerned about your vows.

38:37.930 --> 38:40.897
How did you get back
into the U.S. from Mexico?

38:40.899 --> 38:42.365
That's between me and the Church.

38:42.367 --> 38:45.765
You two share a lot of very
personal secrets, don't you?

38:46.538 --> 38:50.106
Lieutenant Flynn, would you
please escort Father Jonas

38:50.108 --> 38:52.676
to our Visitors Conference Center?

38:52.678 --> 38:54.010
Sure.

38:54.012 --> 38:56.680
Right this way, your somewhat holiness.

39:05.090 --> 39:08.825
Father Jonas' obsession
with Ryan continues.

39:08.827 --> 39:13.930
Or is it his obsession
with Ryan's mother?

39:13.932 --> 39:16.733
You said that she and Jonas looked close.

39:18.437 --> 39:20.737
Chief, are you here to listen
to our interview

39:20.739 --> 39:22.539
with Father Jonas?

39:22.541 --> 39:23.761
No.

39:24.209 --> 39:27.110
I'm coming to tell you that
you've got another crime scene.

39:39.771 --> 39:42.071
When he came back to work,
the doctor seemed upset,

39:42.073 --> 39:43.339
locked himself in his office.

39:43.341 --> 39:44.707
A few hours later,

39:44.709 --> 39:47.076
I went to give him his call sheet, and...

40:04.219 --> 40:05.561
After finding the body,

40:05.563 --> 40:07.630
did either of you touch anything?

40:07.632 --> 40:10.733
Yes, I did. ‭I came in after Cora yelled.

40:10.735 --> 40:13.235
Uh, she was dialing 911
from the desk phone.

40:13.237 --> 40:15.504
I tried the naloxone.

40:15.506 --> 40:17.740
I started carrying it
after his first trip to rehab.

40:17.742 --> 40:20.476
Did chest compressions,
but I was too late.

40:20.478 --> 40:22.178
We haven't called his family.

40:22.180 --> 40:23.846
We'll take care of that.

40:23.848 --> 40:26.549
Uh, if you would please go
with Detective Paige,

40:26.551 --> 40:28.117
she'll escort you into the hallway.

40:28.119 --> 40:30.786
Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

40:31.525 --> 40:33.164
Hmm.

40:33.724 --> 40:36.392
Yeah, he's got a big bruise
across his forehead.

40:36.394 --> 40:37.893
Open bottle of oxy.

40:37.895 --> 40:39.395
Overdose maybe?

40:39.397 --> 40:40.796
He could've passed out,
hit his head on the desk.

40:40.798 --> 40:43.566
Garza felt ‭the walls closing in on him.

40:43.568 --> 40:45.434
The guilt probably caught up with him.

40:45.436 --> 40:48.270
This guy did not kill himself
because he murdered his son.

40:48.272 --> 40:50.072
Well, you don't know that, Julio.

40:50.074 --> 40:52.608
Killing your son is not
a Mexican Catholic crime, sir.

40:52.610 --> 40:55.948
Well, not everyone conforms
to stereotypes.

40:55.950 --> 40:57.688
The truth is... The truth is...

40:57.690 --> 40:59.949
All right, give him a second, Lieutenant.

40:59.951 --> 41:01.350
- He's just frustrated.
- Yeah.

41:01.352 --> 41:03.352
Well, I agree with him about one thing.

41:03.354 --> 41:06.072
As a solution to a murder...

41:07.448 --> 41:11.093
it doesn't get any worse than this.
