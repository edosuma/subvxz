Tender your resignation,

00:46.800 --> 00:48.962
It's a story.
Used to be written by Iris West-Allen.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.485
Something's changed with our future.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.846
God, What did I do?

00:52.000 --> 00:55.447
My brother's dead. I will never make
another memory with Dante again.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.962
You are only a man, Flash,
but I am a god.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.970
I am Savitar.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.770
Now we know Alchemy is just the lackey.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.203
This is it. Here, hold this.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.167
This is it. I can feel it.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.847
I think we should wait before we open it.

02:09.039 --> 02:10.086

02:31.800 --> 02:35.327
Well, I guess Earth-19's Christmas
is just like ours.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.608
Some traditions are multi-versal.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.206
So, um...

02:39.480 --> 02:41.926
- Any more info on Savitar?
-Nope.

02:42.160 --> 02:45.323
All we know is that he's a speed god
and you're the only one who can see him.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.610
All right, well,
Alchemy is Savitar's high priest.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.081
And he gets his power from the stone
that he uses to create metas,

02:51.240 --> 02:52.480
so I was thinking,

02:52.640 --> 02:55.484
if we can find out what that thing is,
maybe we can figure out how to stop him.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.449
I wanna see if I can dig something up.

02:57.640 --> 02:58.641
Okay.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.563
I know this is our first Christmas
together as a couple,

03:08.720 --> 03:10.563
and I want everything to be perfect,
but...

03:11.200 --> 03:13.680
You need to get to this.
Yes, no, I totally get it.

03:13.880 --> 03:17.726
Hey, I got a dissertation here
from Oxford University,

03:17.960 --> 03:22.443
about the myth of an ancient Hindu weapon
called the Brahmastra?

03:22.920 --> 03:25.764
Legendary artifact with incredible powers.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.248
Capable of, wait for it...

03:29.000 --> 03:31.651
- Creating metas.
-Creating meta-humans.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.484
Guys, that looks
just like Alchemy's stone.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.609
More importantly...

03:36.880 --> 03:38.962
Look who wrote this paper.

03:41.760 --> 03:42.966
Juhan?

03:47.640 --> 03:49.369
(CHUCKLES) Love what you've done
with the place.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.321
Ah, Allen.

03:51.720 --> 03:52.801
Thought we had a deal.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.482
I keep your frosty friend's secret and you
never darken these doors again, remember?

03:56.640 --> 04:00.850
I just need some information from you
about that stone that Alchemy uses.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.650
And you've come to me because...

04:04.960 --> 04:06.450
Apparently, you know a lot about it.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.286
Well, why don't you tell me
everything you know.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.204
Then you'll never hear from me again.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.521
(CLICKS TONGUE)

04:15.920 --> 04:17.160
Fine.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.370
Many years ago,
I heard about the Brahmastra,

04:21.640 --> 04:25.611
or as it's colloquially called,
"The Philosopher's Stone."

04:26.520 --> 04:29.205
It is said to be the first object
to give human beings powers.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.930
Like the particle accelerator.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.123
Over the years, it got lost.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.641
I became quite obsessed
with trying to find it.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.207
Did every piece of available research
I could,

04:38.360 --> 04:40.203
and much to my parents' dismay,

04:40.360 --> 04:44.888
I used my future inheritance and funded
an expedition to try and find it.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.206
But we never found it.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.201
Pretty soon after that, I came here.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.881
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

04:53.160 --> 04:57.210
In your research, have you ever
come across the name "Savitar"?

05:01.120 --> 05:02.884
How do you know that name?

05:03.120 --> 05:04.724
I've done some research of my own.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.044
As far as I know,
Savitar is the first meta with speed.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.362
That is all I know, Allen.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.486
And I suggest
that you don't waste your time on this.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.566
Move on.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.361
All right.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.571
SAVITAR: Julian.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.840
Here you go.

05:45.120 --> 05:48.169
One whiff of aliens

05:48.360 --> 05:50.886

you dig yourself out sooner,

The Flash hit me too hard.
I'm gonna sue you, Saucer Head!

07:23.000 --> 07:24.764
One day, I'll own that helmet,

07:25.040 --> 07:27.884
and I'll use it as an ashtray,
or a candy dish.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.605
No, wait! A hubcap.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.121

to Earth-3 to stop my Trickster.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.885
I have something
I need to talk to you about.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.044
Speedster. Calls himself "Savitar."

07:46.160 --> 07:47.161

07:47.880 --> 07:50.884
- So, Savitar?
-Yeah.

Apparently, you've grown powerful enough
to challenge him.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.525
- Who is he?
-Don't know. Never seen him.

You're the first speedster

But every story I ever heard about Savitar
is basically the same.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.810
Savitar was the first man
ever granted speed.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.647
<i>And over time,</i>

08:12.880 --> 08:15.929
<i>he became the God of Motion,
the fastest of us all.</i>

-Hmm.

What's he preparing for?

08:30.760 --> 08:33.126
- A battle. With you.
-Why me?

You're threatening his power.

12:34.840 --> 12:39.004
I did get you something, yeah.
I just, I haven't wrapped it yet is all.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.851
_OkaY-
_OkaY-

12:43.120 --> 12:44.645
Okay. By the way,

12:44.840 --> 12:47.684
after you told me
about Julian's archeological dig,

12:47.840 --> 12:49.410
I started doing some

12:49.560 --> 12:51.085
-digging of my own.
-Uh-huh.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.205
Turns out, a few years ago,

12:53.400 --> 12:55.767
four scientists were killed
in an excavation in India,

12:55.960 --> 12:58.440
and Julian was the point person.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.205
He didn't mention that.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.724
You said he was obsessed
with that stone for years.

13:03.880 --> 13:07.487
What if he was covering something up?
Or someone?

13:07.960 --> 13:09.724
You think this is about Alchemy?

13:10.400 --> 13:12.209
There's only one way to find out.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.162
Julian lied about the Philosopher's Stone.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.402
I think he found it
back on that archeological dig.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.250
You think he's working with
Doctor Alchemy?

13:21.640 --> 13:23.369
He's not answering my calls.

13:23.640 --> 13:26.086
Hey, everyone. Gang's all here.
What's going on?

13:26.520 --> 13:29.729
I think that Julian
is connected to Doctor Alchemy.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.245
- Jay, we got a hit.
-(BEEPING)

13:32.440 --> 13:35.250
There's energy coming from the top
of the Shultz building. That's the stone.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.561
- You ready?
-Ready.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.131
- All right.
-I'm coming, too.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.406
- JOE: No, you're not.
-No.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.244
Dad, I'm ready.

13:41.440 --> 13:44.364
Just tell them about how fast I am.
Tell them about the training.

13:44.560 --> 13:46.130
-"Training?"
-"Training?"

13:46.360 --> 13:50.126
Oh, training. The vocal training
because we're thinking of going caroling.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.602
We're gonna talk about this later.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.488
We're definitely gonna talk about it.

14:01.240 --> 14:06.087
With the energy from this stone
and this building as a refractor,

14:06.600 --> 14:10.730
I shall restore the powers
of all the metas from Flashpoint.

14:11.040 --> 14:15.204
They will become the servants of Savitar.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.365
It's over, Alchemy.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.730
Please, tell me you're seeing him?

14:22.920 --> 14:24.126
(ROARING)

14:24.920 --> 14:26.126
Oh, I see him.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.885
We have to take him together.

14:28.080 --> 14:31.129
No, I'll cover Savitar,
you just get that stone.

14:47.560 --> 14:48.800

15:05.640 --> 15:06.801

15:11.320 --> 15:14.130
This is not your fight, Garrick.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.005

15:38.600 --> 15:39.931

15:48.360 --> 15:50.647
<i>JULIAN: Where am I? What's going on?</i>

15:53.720 --> 15:56.087
Let's just say
you're gonna be our guest for a while.

15:56.520 --> 15:57.726
You.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.890
I always suspected you had your own
private facility for holding your enemies.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.770
You care to explain what I'm doing in it?

16:03.080 --> 16:05.560
- I know you're Alchemy, Julian.
-What?

16:05.800 --> 16:08.849
Turning innocent people into meta-humans,
worshipping this Savitar.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.730
Sorry, I'm still not following.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.805
(CHUCKLES) You think that I'm Alchemy?

16:14.360 --> 16:16.044
<i>That's the most absurd thing
I've ever heard.</i>

16:16.280 --> 16:18.362
The mask?
I've never seen that before in my life.

16:18.520 --> 16:22.127
Icaughtyoul
I caught you wearing this mask.

16:22.520 --> 16:23.931
You're trying to set me up.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.241
<i>You're framing me, aren't you?</i>

16:25.560 --> 16:27.961
Flash, of all the people,
you are setting me up, the hero.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.208
- You're insane.
-The great hero.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.768
I want my phone call.
When will I get my phone call?

16:36.840 --> 16:37.966
- Hey. (SIGHS)
-GARRICK: Hey.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.241
How you feeling?

16:39.400 --> 16:41.323
Not too bad for a guy
that got beat up by a myth.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.364
- Yeah?
-You stopped him.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.204
Well done, Barry.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.488
It was nice, having you out there with me.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.166
- Yeah, I've never had a sidekick.
-I'm your sidekick?

16:50.360 --> 16:53.728
- Well, as the senior partner...
-Senior citizen's more like it.

16:53.920 --> 16:54.921

16:55.240 --> 16:58.403

would've been proud of you, right?

17:00.760 --> 17:02.762
Hey, why don't you...
There, just take it easy, all right?

17:03.040 --> 17:05.088
I'll see you in a little bit.

17:05.920 --> 17:06.967
(SIGHS)

17:09.160 --> 17:10.685
(BARRY SIGHS)

17:11.319 --> 17:13.402
What do you think about
what Julian was saying?

17:13.599 --> 17:16.762
I know that every bad guy we've ever had
has pretended to be our best friend,

17:16.920 --> 17:20.367
while really being
an evil murderous bastard, but...

17:20.599 --> 17:23.410
I think if he's lying, he sure believes
the hell out of his own lie.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.444
Okay, well,
what do we think about this box?

17:25.599 --> 17:26.726
It's creepy.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.119
Like, <i>Indiana</i> Jones,
melt-your-face creepy.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.765
Have you guys figured out
anything about it yet?

17:32.400 --> 17:33.765
It's nothing.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.164
- Hmm. It's something...
-No, I mean, the box is literally nothing.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.482
<i>I've run it through
every possible test I can think of.</i>

17:40.680 --> 17:44.048
MRI, X-Ray, mass spectrometer,
the photon shifter.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.848
Not a single reading. Nothing.

17:47.080 --> 17:51.051
It's like the box doesn't even exist.

17:52.320 --> 17:55.529
Two weeks ago, I almost lost you
to Alchemy. Then last week, aliens.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.683
- My heart can't take it, Wally.
-Dad, he gets it.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.685
- Iris, does he?
-I think so, yeah.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.206
And you.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.489
A couple weeks ago you were telling me
how you believed in me and my instincts,

18:05.640 --> 18:08.530
and now you're encouraging
Wally to do exactly the opposite?

18:08.680 --> 18:10.523
I don't know
how much encouraging he needed.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.923
- What's the deal with you?
-Hmm?

18:13.560 --> 18:16.689
You have some psychotic need to make
other people like you no matter what?

18:16.840 --> 18:18.205
I wouldn't call it "Psychotic."

18:18.360 --> 18:22.763
No, my deal is, I find people's true
talents, I just marshal them along.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.524
Do you even have your own opinions?

18:24.680 --> 18:26.250
Stop, stop banging on H.R.

18:26.440 --> 18:27.521
<i>This was all me, okay?</i>

18:27.960 --> 18:30.327
I pushed him to train me,
I pushed him to help me.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.569
Wasn't like anyone else
was lining up to do it.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.530
<i>BARRY". Hey, what's up?</i>

18:43.080 --> 18:44.411
It's Wally.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.801
I don't get it, Barry,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.322
it's like his brain goes to sleep
and somebody else is at the wheel.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.968
Have you been losing time? Blacking out?

18:56.320 --> 18:58.482
Hours pass,
you waking up somewhere different,

18:58.800 --> 19:01.041
-not being sure of how you got there?
-No.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.770
- No?
-No.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.282
I've had enough of these
baseless accusations

19:05.440 --> 19:07.090
and ridiculous theories of yours.

19:07.240 --> 19:10.084
Julian, I'm trying to help you,
but you need to trust me.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.129
Says the man in a mask.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.005
Yeah, you're right.

19:21.720 --> 19:22.721
(SCOFFS)

19:23.120 --> 19:26.329
I should've known. I should've guessed it.
(GROANS)

19:27.680 --> 19:31.321
The unexplained absences,
your passion for metas,

19:31.560 --> 19:33.722
your general thumbing your nose
at authority.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.849
I'm sure you had a good laugh
behind my back.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.083
I actually wished
I could've told you before.

19:38.320 --> 19:39.606
So why tell me now?

19:39.960 --> 19:41.724
Because I need you to trust me, Julian.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.810
You are Alchemy.
I just don't think you were aware of it.

19:45.160 --> 19:46.889
Now, have you been blacking out?

19:48.320 --> 19:49.401
Yes.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.810
When did it start?

19:53.640 --> 19:56.610
My sister, Emma, died when I was 20.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.290
It really broke the family up, you know?

19:59.440 --> 20:02.284
Mum and Dad weren't speaking,
they wouldn't even stay at the house.

20:02.720 --> 20:06.202
One night, I was there alone
and she came back to me.

20:07.720 --> 20:10.644
She stood right in front of me,
clear as day.

20:10.800 --> 20:14.691
A ghost or a vision, I don't know,
but she was real.

20:15.320 --> 20:16.367
What happened?

20:16.960 --> 20:18.883
She told me about the stone.

20:19.080 --> 20:22.004
She told me where to find it,
she told me that if I got it,

20:22.280 --> 20:24.203
that it would bring us back
together again.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.444
And at that point, mate,
I would've done anything to have her back.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.445
<i>And so I did.</i>

20:30.640 --> 20:32.483
I mounted an expedition to India.

20:33.480 --> 20:37.451
Days, we searched, weeks. Nothing.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.047
And then we found it.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.482
Next thing I remember,
I woke up in the hotel room.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.484
I didn't remember anything,

20:46.760 --> 20:48.922
and that's when the blackouts
started happening.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.168
<i>There was a news report saying that</i>

20:51.360 --> 20:55.206
every other member of my team
had been found dead.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.125
<i>At the site.</i>

20:58.080 --> 21:01.562
(SIGHS) I panicked, I thought they were
gonna blame me for their deaths, so I ran.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.409
I ran to America.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.489
What happens when you black out, Julian?

21:07.840 --> 21:09.205
<i>How does it start?</i>

21:09.440 --> 21:10.805
I hear the voice.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.121

Stop scaring me!

21:23.400 --> 21:26.210

21:27.520 --> 21:29.204
<i>Oh, I know exactly what you are.</i>

21:29.520 --> 21:32.569
You are a figment of my grief.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.649
Please, just leave.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.371
I can't do that, Cisco.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.770
This is not real.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.247
Okay, I need an anti-psychotic. Caitlin!

21:41.440 --> 21:44.364
Ifyouleave,
I'm gonna have to leave, too.

21:46.320 --> 21:49.290
(SIGHS) So you're telling me
that every time I'm blacking out...

21:49.480 --> 21:51.721
- You've become Alchemy.
-That's impossible.

21:52.160 --> 21:56.051
Alchemy is a monster,
he's been terrorizing people for years.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.401
Look, it's not you.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.364
<i>Just like it wasn't you back on that dig.</i>

21:59.600 --> 22:02.001
I know that this is hard to believe,

22:02.160 --> 22:04.845
but you have to start accepting
what's happening to you.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.727
Don't you want us to be together again?

22:08.480 --> 22:11.211
The stone. It's the key to everything.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.204
It can transform people.

22:14.240 --> 22:17.005
Open it and I can be reborn.

22:17.360 --> 22:19.408
We can be together again.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.091
We can have that bottle of whiskey.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.126
After all, it is Christmas, hermano.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.648
It's the time of miracles.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.122
I just want this to be real.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.689
Just open the box.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.291
I love you, Cisco.

You sure you're okay?

25:00.760 --> 25:02.444
Still in one piece.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.086
I don't know what happened.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.449
So now that the box is closed,
Savitar is, what, gone for good?

25:07.760 --> 25:10.206
I don't know, but we need to find out.

25:10.480 --> 25:13.290
Cisco, if we can't use this box...

25:13.600 --> 25:16.763
Julian, he may be
our only link to Savitar now, right?

25:17.280 --> 25:19.123
I think we can use both of them.

25:19.560 --> 25:24.521
If Caitlin's right and this thing messes
with brain waves, then I have a plan.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.166
Hey-

25:31.440 --> 25:33.807
You put my son's life in danger again.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.201
And he saved Barry's life.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.365
<i>Joe, why...</i>

25:39.000 --> 25:40.650
Why do you think I help Wally?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.810
Because I'm selfish? Because I get
something? I don't get anything out of it.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.890
I helped Wally because the kid is special.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.484
He's extraordinary,
his powers are extraordinary.

25:50.680 --> 25:53.650
And, look, I get it. I'm not his dad,

25:53.960 --> 25:56.088
and I don't have the same safety concerns
of you, of course not,

25:56.320 --> 25:58.448
but, Joe, one thing I do know?

25:58.720 --> 26:00.848
The longer you deny someone
their potential,

26:01.120 --> 26:02.724
the more they're gonna
look for it elsewhere.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.290
So what am I doing here?

26:09.480 --> 26:12.643
Okay, Julian,
today when I was fighting Savitar,

26:12.960 --> 26:14.803
he and Alchemy, they have the same voice.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.050
- What does that mean?
-I don't think there is an Alchemy.

26:18.280 --> 26:20.567
I think it's Savitar,
speaking through you.

26:20.840 --> 26:24.162
Savitar clearly possesses someone
who rallies worshippers.

26:24.320 --> 26:27.085
But he's like a Poltergeist,
he needs a medium to manifest himself.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.482
- You.
-Right. But what does that mean?

26:29.640 --> 26:33.850
We think we've figured out a way
to sync your brain to the stone.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.249
And it'll allow us
to speak directly to Savitar.

26:36.640 --> 26:37.641
I see.

26:37.840 --> 26:41.003
If you wanna try to be free of this,
you need to trust us.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.362
- I've never liked you, Allen.
-(SCOFFS)

26:48.560 --> 26:50.767
- Yeah.
-Having a little seance with your friends

26:50.960 --> 26:53.201
now is not gonna help change that fact,
you do know that?

26:57.040 --> 26:59.168
Fine. I'll try it.

27:02.560 --> 27:05.404
- Deep breaths. Okay?
-Yeah.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.881
You're gonna count backwards from 10.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.886
You're not God.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.765
To be a god, you just have to make people

No one believes in you.

-Everything.

I mean, that was...
Was it not truly frightening?

29:26.200 --> 29:28.726
What, with the voice and the prophecies
and...

29:29.160 --> 29:30.969
Oh, that was a scare-a-thon, wasn't it?

29:31.160 --> 29:33.208
I'm gonna go have a mint tea and a coffee
and a lay down.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.842
Do you think the things that he said about
one of us betraying him

29:37.080 --> 29:39.924
and one of us dying could really be true?

29:40.080 --> 29:42.731

29:42.920 --> 29:44.763
that pissed him off

29:44.920 --> 29:47.605
then maybe he knows
what happens to "future us."

29:47.880 --> 29:49.211
He doesn't.

29:49.400 --> 29:51.050
He's never getting out of
wherever he's trapped.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.804
How are we supposed to stop him?

29:54.040 --> 29:55.371
GARRICK: The stone.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.128
Jay's right, the stone has been
the key to everything.

29:59.280 --> 30:02.841
It's how he controlled Julian,
it's how he's created more metas.

30:03.080 --> 30:06.243
So we destroy the stone
and Savitar is gone for good.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.408
It's impossible to destroy.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.882
It's been around forever,
there's a reason for that.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.246
Why don't we just bury it again?

30:12.400 --> 30:14.164
Put it back in the ground
where you found it.

30:14.320 --> 30:15.560
Mmm-mmm. Jumanji.

30:15.720 --> 30:18.087
Someone would just find it,
and we'd be right back where we started.

30:18.240 --> 30:20.288
We need to make that box
disappear forever.

30:20.440 --> 30:22.408
There's only one thing we can do with it.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.085
Throw it into the Speed Force.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.049
- Wait, you can do that?
- GARRICK: Oh, <i>yeah.</i>

30:27.560 --> 30:31.804
The Speed Force is eternity itself,
an endless void of time and energy.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.327
It'd be like trying to find it
after it got lost in space.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.046
But that stone is loaded
with gravimetric force.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.646
I mean,
I don't think you could run fast enough

30:39.800 --> 30:41.928
to reach the Speed Force
and carry that at the same time.

30:42.080 --> 30:43.764
He can with my help.

<i>We run as fast as we can.</i>

You trail behind me,
siphon off some of my speed,

30:48.760 --> 30:50.489

and when you have enough,

30:50.640 --> 30:52.369
throw that thing
deep into the Speed Force.

30:54.280 --> 30:56.248
And that will work?

36:30.040 --> 36:33.123
- In fact, you did the same for me.
-I was gonna say it.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.683
<i>Came, Came. Uscan.</i>

36:36.120 --> 36:39.010
Okay. (EXHALES)
You gotta try their eggnog?

36:39.240 --> 36:43.689
<i>The holiday concoction done by Joe
and his hot girlfriend.</i>

36:43.960 --> 36:45.086
Babe.

36:46.200 --> 36:47.486
- Hey.
-What's up?

36:47.680 --> 36:48.920
Nothing.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.248
You seem a little weird.
No?

36:53.240 --> 36:55.129
You do know we won, right?

36:55.280 --> 36:57.282
We defeated the bad guy.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.204
- Yeah, I know.
-Okay.

36:59.480 --> 37:02.245
- Grandma Esther.
-Grandma Millie.

37:02.480 --> 37:03.811
Let's see.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.161
Mmm.

37:07.680 --> 37:09.170
- Damn, that's strong.
-Oh! (LAUGHS)

37:09.560 --> 37:11.289
So is that, my God.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.608
- Our grandmothers are alcoholics.
-Yes.

37:16.760 --> 37:20.970
You know, technically, we don't have to be
standing under the mistletoe to...

37:24.520 --> 37:25.806
Finally.

37:27.080 --> 37:31.483
- No comments from the peanut gallery.
-No, but really, it's about time.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.488
- What?
-Hold on.

37:34.640 --> 37:35.846
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

37:36.320 --> 37:38.129
And it's my daughter.

37:38.440 --> 37:40.010
- Yeah, just, give me a quick minute?
-Hmm.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.488
And then we can... Yeah.

37:43.080 --> 37:45.526
- Joe. I saw you kiss her, good job.
-Shh!

37:45.760 --> 37:46.761
(SHUSHING)

37:47.280 --> 37:50.682
Oh, that's right. The thing. BA. Come on.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.248
<i>- How many of those have you had?
- Where's he going? Hey.</i>

37:53.520 --> 37:55.045
- I'm right here.
-I see you.

37:55.280 --> 37:59.365
Now that Cecile is away,
this is from all of us to you.

38:00.560 --> 38:02.369
<i>Merry Christmas, son.</i>

38:03.760 --> 38:05.205
(LAUGHING)

38:06.400 --> 38:08.562
- Are you serious?
-Yeah, man, it's time.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.484
You're ready, Wallace.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.570
Welcome to the team.

38:12.760 --> 38:14.205
<i>Kid Flash.</i>

38:15.040 --> 38:16.530
Are we really calling me Kid Flash?

38:16.720 --> 38:18.051
Yeah, I think we are.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.605
Kid Flash!

38:19.800 --> 38:20.961
-(SHUSHING)
-(KNOCKING)

38:21.360 --> 38:22.407
- Police!
-I got it.

38:22.560 --> 38:25.245
- It's not the... We're the police.
-You're the police.

38:25.440 --> 38:26.441
Calm down.

38:28.680 --> 38:29.920
- Hey, Julian.
-Hey.

38:30.120 --> 38:31.884
- Come on. Here, let me get that.
-Thanks.

38:33.560 --> 38:36.882
After everything that happened,
being alone felt a bit lonely, so...

38:37.120 --> 38:39.248
- Yeah.
-This is for you.

38:39.720 --> 38:40.926
What's this?

38:41.120 --> 38:43.043
I spoke to Captain Singh,
and he hadn't put through

38:43.200 --> 38:45.407
your resignation paperwork yet, so...

38:45.560 --> 38:48.609
Well, if you'd, you know,
like your old lab back,

38:48.800 --> 38:51.406
or, I mean, like to share it again...

38:52.440 --> 38:54.010
Thanks, Julian.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.209
Merry Christmas, man.

38:56.520 --> 38:58.761
- Cheers, mate.
-Yeah, thank you.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.121
- Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

39:00.280 --> 39:01.566
Can I offer you some eggnog?

39:01.720 --> 39:04.041
Oh, I'd love some, yeah.
Happy Christmas, everyone.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.163
- I'm glad you came.
-Thank you. Yeah.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.451
- Oh!
-(CAROLERS SINGING)

39:09.320 --> 39:10.924
- Did you hear that?
-it's outside.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.166
<i>Carolers.</i>

39:15.640 --> 39:17.449
(SINGING)

39:23.920 --> 39:25.126
Caroling in the rain.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.246
That sucks.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.360
Hey-

39:32.760 --> 39:34.330
- What're you doing?
-it's okay, I got this.

39:34.520 --> 39:36.284
We may not be able
to have a perfect Christmas,

39:36.440 --> 39:38.647
but we can have a white one.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.050
(SINGING CONTINUES)

39:47.800 --> 39:50.531
So, when are we gonna exchange presents?

39:51.720 --> 39:54.200
- How about right now?
-Okay.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.926
Follow me, come on. Let's get out of here.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.208
Okay, going through a door, be careful.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.204
All right? Right here.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.962
- Okay, you ready?
-Yeah.

40:07.320 --> 40:08.651
All right.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.088
Open your eyes, now.

40:17.760 --> 40:20.161
I don't understand. Where are we?

40:21.320 --> 40:22.685
Home.

40:27.320 --> 40:28.367
What?

40:28.640 --> 40:31.166
I couldn't sleep on Cisco's couch anymore

40:31.480 --> 40:34.563
and your place is sort of small for two,

40:34.720 --> 40:36.688
so I signed a lease,

40:36.880 --> 40:39.645
and I put both of our names on it.

40:42.360 --> 40:44.044
I got you a wallet.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.364
I'm sure I'll love it.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.488
Barry, this is a big step.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.805
Not for me.

40:56.320 --> 40:59.449
I don't know
what's gonna happen in the future.

41:00.560 --> 41:02.005
All I know is, right here, right now,

41:02.200 --> 41:04.248
I wanna spend every moment I can with you.

41:05.160 --> 41:07.811
You're the first thing I wanna see
when I wake up.

41:08.240 --> 41:10.481
You're the last thing I wanna...

41:15.720 --> 41:17.245
I love you, Barry Allen.

41:17.880 --> 41:19.723
I love you, Iris West.
