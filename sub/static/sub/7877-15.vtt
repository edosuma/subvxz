00:34.133 --> 00:36.668
Help! We're trapped
in this elevator!

00:36.735 --> 00:38.169
We're going to die in here!

00:38.237 --> 00:39.704
Stan, I have you.

00:39.772 --> 00:41.572
I will not let
anything happen to you.

00:41.640 --> 00:44.075
Here, smell my mouth.

00:44.143 --> 00:45.109
Garlic chicken.

00:45.177 --> 00:47.011
Your favorite.

00:47.079 --> 00:48.880
Thank you, Roger.

00:48.947 --> 00:50.315
If we get out of here,

00:50.382 --> 00:52.183
we're going to be
best friends forever.

00:52.251 --> 00:55.186
Oh, Stan, we'll go straight
to the Jewelry Galleria

00:55.254 --> 00:56.454
and buy something to commemorate

00:56.522 --> 00:59.190
our remarkable friendship.
High five!

01:03.729 --> 01:06.597
Is this anything like
what you're talking about?

01:09.735 --> 01:12.403
This is exactly what
we're talking about.

01:12.471 --> 01:14.205
Stan, will you put mine on?

01:18.944 --> 01:21.279
You've made me so happy.

01:24.249 --> 01:25.516
Buddy, I need your help.

01:25.584 --> 01:27.185
Francine will be
here in ten seconds

01:27.252 --> 01:29.053
and I'm going to tell her something
she doesn't want to hear

01:29.121 --> 01:30.555
Play along. Finally!

01:32.624 --> 01:34.025
No, just agree with me.

01:34.093 --> 01:35.626
Oh. Hey, Stan.

01:35.694 --> 01:38.096
Just reminding you-- tomorrow's
our drive up to wine country.

01:38.163 --> 01:39.630
Tomorrow?!

01:39.698 --> 01:42.667
Oh, boy, tomorrow's a
big work day at work.

01:42.735 --> 01:45.236
What?! Stan, I've been planning

01:45.304 --> 01:47.472
this wine tasting
trip for a long time.

01:47.539 --> 01:49.874
I wanted to go, but the
security level is at orange.

01:49.942 --> 01:51.309
It's more dangerous now.

01:51.377 --> 01:53.578
Orange, it's more dangerous now.

01:53.645 --> 01:55.780
I call bullarky, Stan.

01:55.848 --> 01:57.882
You just don't want
to go wine tasting.

01:57.950 --> 02:00.218
Well, take Roger.
Wine lover right here.

02:00.285 --> 02:01.919
Also a heroin lover in case anyone

02:01.987 --> 02:03.254
wants to schedule a poppy tour.

02:03.322 --> 02:04.889
Huge heroin fan.

02:04.957 --> 02:06.591
Don't use it,
just like being around it.

02:06.658 --> 02:09.193
Study it. Appreciate it.
Use it sometimes.

02:09.261 --> 02:11.863
Fine!

02:11.930 --> 02:13.931
Good looking out, buddy. High five.

02:13.999 --> 02:15.366
Yeah! Yeah!

02:20.939 --> 02:23.408
The red ball. Yes!

02:23.475 --> 02:25.376
Hey, Pinkerton,
you're giving everyone

02:25.444 --> 02:27.044
an "A" on this dumb lab.

02:27.112 --> 02:30.381
Sure, and I'll throw
in some suckers.

02:32.851 --> 02:35.286
I want to lick your lolly.

02:38.991 --> 02:40.925
Now, kiss me.

02:40.993 --> 02:42.760
I'm not going to kiss you...

02:42.828 --> 02:44.929
with my top on.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.500
No! Amy!

02:49.568 --> 02:51.269
I have so much horniness to give!

02:51.336 --> 02:53.371
Steve, it's just a dream.

02:53.439 --> 02:54.906
It was more than a dream, Klaus.

02:54.973 --> 02:56.207
It was a lucid dream.

02:56.275 --> 02:57.942
Oh-ho, it happens.

02:58.010 --> 03:00.111
We'll just put your
sheets in the wash.

03:00.179 --> 03:02.313
No, a "lucid" dream.

03:02.381 --> 03:04.515
It's when you have total
control over everything.

03:04.583 --> 03:05.917
I trained myself.

03:05.984 --> 03:07.752
When I see a red ball, it's a sign

03:07.820 --> 03:10.054
that I'm dreaming and I
can do whatever I want.

03:10.122 --> 03:11.355
You must teach me.

03:11.423 --> 03:13.357
Oh, that is such a coincidence.

03:13.425 --> 03:14.992
Klaus, are you ready
for coincidence time?

03:15.060 --> 03:17.028
I was just telling Toshi
how I wanted to teach

03:17.095 --> 03:19.096
some whiny fish how
to loose a dream.

03:19.164 --> 03:21.299
I mean, come on! Later, dumb ass.

03:22.601 --> 03:24.402
Why?

03:24.470 --> 03:26.471
Francine's pretty mad at
me for bailing on her.

03:26.538 --> 03:28.873
She made me have sex
by myself last night.

03:28.941 --> 03:30.775
Yeah, I know. We were
watching <i>CSI</i> together.

03:30.843 --> 03:32.310
Well, thanks for doing this, man.

03:32.377 --> 03:34.445
Oh, and watch your
back for horn dogs.

03:34.513 --> 03:37.148
Lot of Sweet Petes up in the wine
country looking for an easy lay.

03:37.216 --> 03:38.783
I'm the vagina goalie. Got it.

03:38.851 --> 03:40.418
Let's go, Roger.

03:41.820 --> 03:43.488
Bye, baby.

03:43.555 --> 03:45.423
You got this handled?

03:45.491 --> 03:46.691
Damn straight! Swing it!

03:46.758 --> 03:48.559
Oh, yeah.

03:48.627 --> 03:50.361
Uh, yeah, yeah, get,
get a little closer.

03:50.429 --> 03:52.263
You bend down, come at an angle.

03:52.331 --> 03:53.631
Yeah! Yeah!

03:56.301 --> 03:57.935
Screw Stan.

03:58.003 --> 03:59.904
We can have a great
time without him, right?

03:59.972 --> 04:01.239
How could we not?

04:01.306 --> 04:03.741
I mean, look, they've got
a wine train we can ride!

04:03.809 --> 04:05.243
Wait-- can we ride it?

04:05.310 --> 04:08.012
It's a small train that
goes through the vineyards

04:08.080 --> 04:10.615
and carries passengers-- yes,
we can ride the wine train!

04:10.682 --> 04:11.916
Choo-choo!

04:11.984 --> 04:14.519
Don't... do that.

04:22.928 --> 04:24.962
Roger, am I not good company?

04:25.030 --> 04:27.231
I mean, why didn't
Stan want to come?

04:27.299 --> 04:28.699
Oh, you know Stan.

04:28.767 --> 04:30.568
He's a big weirdo.
Oh, before I forget.

04:30.636 --> 04:32.737
This is my wine journal
from my last tour.

04:32.804 --> 04:33.905
I got you one.

04:33.972 --> 04:35.306
We can rate the wines we taste.

04:35.374 --> 04:36.641
Check out my system.

04:36.708 --> 04:38.609
I guess I didn't like
this particular wine

04:38.677 --> 04:41.279
because next to the name,
I drew a butt taking a dookie.

04:41.346 --> 04:43.781
But here, this one. This one's
a dookie and a baseball cap.

04:43.849 --> 04:46.417
A hat means I like the wine.
What's that?

04:46.485 --> 04:48.352
That's a dookie and
an Indian headdress.

04:48.420 --> 04:49.987
Racist-- I was drunk by then.

04:50.055 --> 04:51.556
Ah, the hell with Stan.

04:51.623 --> 04:53.524
Let's get ripped. Yeah!

04:53.592 --> 04:55.726
I got a map with all
the best spots in town.

04:55.794 --> 04:56.961
You said raped, right?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.402
Whoa, Frannie,
you might want to slow down.

05:04.469 --> 05:06.771
More like you might
want to speed up.

05:08.373 --> 05:11.008
Ha-ha! It's on, bitch!

05:11.076 --> 05:12.810
I'm going to go-
I'm going to go hit the head,

05:12.878 --> 05:15.012
come back and get ruined.

05:15.080 --> 05:18.482
Like, just ruin myself
and everything around me.

05:23.155 --> 05:24.922
Did you just drink my wine?

05:24.990 --> 05:27.592
Prolly. I'm getting
drunk off my ass.

05:27.659 --> 05:29.126
Very nice.

05:29.194 --> 05:31.629
Two lubricants down this way,
<i>por favor.</i>

05:33.265 --> 05:35.299
Yo, Jack, you better step away.

05:35.367 --> 05:37.101
That's my best friend's girl.

05:37.169 --> 05:39.036
Did you, did you already pee?

05:39.104 --> 05:42.139
No, I didn't make it.
But this guy, this guy here--

05:42.207 --> 05:44.842
Mr. Sweet Pete-
he thinks he's making it.

05:44.910 --> 05:46.477
Just buying the lady a drink.

05:46.545 --> 05:48.312
I'll buy her the drinks, thank you.

05:48.380 --> 05:50.982
Can, can you,
can you spot me a $20?

05:51.049 --> 05:54.185
I lost my wallet somewhere
in this thieving town!

05:55.954 --> 05:56.988
Thank you!

05:57.055 --> 05:59.290
Oh, my God, thank you so much.

05:59.358 --> 06:02.193
This is-- I can't,
I can't even believe-- thank you.

06:02.260 --> 06:05.096
Thank you. This is an honest town.

06:05.163 --> 06:07.398
Somebody, somebody
just turned it in?

06:07.466 --> 06:09.467
No, you found it in your jacket.

06:09.534 --> 06:11.435
Thank you.

06:11.503 --> 06:14.572
I'm 'bout, I'm 'bout
ready to call it a night.

06:19.144 --> 06:22.780
You're fun! That's who you are.

06:30.255 --> 06:32.189
Mia, we need napkins over here!

06:34.660 --> 06:36.727
So, the kitchen's
closing in five minutes,

06:36.795 --> 06:38.863
uh, if you want anything. Anything?

06:38.930 --> 06:41.532
Can you ask the chef if
he can whip me up a room

06:41.600 --> 06:44.168
without so many pubic
hairs in the bathtub?

06:44.236 --> 06:46.103
That's funny.

06:46.171 --> 06:48.172
Yeah, that's why I said it.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.473
She likes you.

06:49.541 --> 06:51.742
That bowser?
She thinks I'm a Milk Bone.

06:52.978 --> 06:54.245
Come on.

07:00.786 --> 07:04.522
Hey, look how much I love wine, frannie.

07:04.589 --> 07:06.424
You perv!

07:08.000 --> 07:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:18.574 --> 07:19.707
Roger! What?

07:19.775 --> 07:22.143
God! Why did you do that?

07:22.211 --> 07:24.345
Oh! I'm sorry.

07:24.413 --> 07:25.980
I'm so sorry.

07:26.048 --> 07:28.082
I didn't mean,
I didn't mean-- I'm sorry.

07:28.150 --> 07:30.251
I'm just, I'm j-- I'm drunk.

07:30.319 --> 07:33.221
Look, I'll, I'll go to
sleep in the car now.

07:33.288 --> 07:35.656
I'll, I'm just-
I'll go to the car, okay?

07:35.724 --> 07:37.358
Ow!

07:45.100 --> 07:47.902
Make me breakfast...

07:47.970 --> 07:50.171
What's up with Steve?
He's sleeping all the time.

07:50.239 --> 07:52.373
He's on a lucid dream kick.

07:52.441 --> 07:54.042
Well, not during <i>Iconoclasts</i>

07:54.109 --> 07:55.243
with Katherine Helmond and Usher.

07:55.310 --> 07:57.111
I don't know who you are.

07:57.179 --> 07:59.447
I don't know who <i>you</i> are.

08:00.849 --> 08:02.050
Hey, wake up!

08:02.117 --> 08:03.151
Can't you do that somewhere else?

08:03.218 --> 08:05.353
It doesn't matter where I do it.

08:05.421 --> 08:07.755
When I go into my dreams, I'm king.

08:07.823 --> 08:09.991
It's awesome! You should try it.

08:10.059 --> 08:11.993
Maybe in your dreams you
could have some friends.

08:12.061 --> 08:13.594
Shut up. I have friends.

08:13.662 --> 08:16.631
Oh, right! I forgot about
your best friend, the fish.

08:16.698 --> 08:18.399
Fools.

08:18.467 --> 08:19.834
What a jerk.

08:19.902 --> 08:22.103
We need to take him down a peg.

08:22.171 --> 08:24.005
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

08:24.073 --> 08:27.809
<i>Use the secret mental telepathy</i> <i>we
share to bring down Steve?</i>

08:27.876 --> 08:31.179
<i>No, I say we mess with Steve</i>
<i>without using our powers.</i>

08:31.246 --> 08:33.014
<i>God!</i> <i>Stick-in-the-mud bitch.</i>

08:33.082 --> 08:34.849
<i>Klaus, you know I
can hear you.</i>

08:34.917 --> 08:36.217
<i>Yeah, I'm pissed!</i>

08:36.284 --> 08:37.385
<i>I'm insulting you.</i>

08:42.323 --> 08:44.292
Ah! Oh...

08:44.359 --> 08:48.663
Roger, maybe we should
talk about last night.

08:48.730 --> 08:50.498
Get some breakfast? Excellent! Oh!

08:56.338 --> 08:57.705
Y'all have enough time?

08:57.773 --> 09:00.808
I'll have two eggs,
one over easy, one over medium,

09:00.876 --> 09:03.144
three sausage links,
a cup of cottage cheese

09:03.212 --> 09:04.846
with a drizzle of honey,
a fruit cup--

09:04.913 --> 09:07.048
unless it's honeydew melon,
in which case, skip it

09:07.116 --> 09:08.749
and make it half a grapefruit.

09:08.817 --> 09:12.153
A glass of whole milk over ice and
a side of toast, barely browned.

09:12.221 --> 09:14.055
Closer to bread than toast-
I'm not joking--

09:14.123 --> 09:16.491
with as many local jams
as you have in stock.

09:16.558 --> 09:18.693
Oh, and a bloody Mary.
We don't serve alcohol.

09:23.699 --> 09:25.733
Look, about last night...
It was nothing.

09:25.801 --> 09:27.635
I made a stupid, drunk mistake

09:27.703 --> 09:28.870
and it'll never happen again.

09:28.937 --> 09:30.972
Good. We'll put it behind us

09:31.039 --> 09:32.540
and, hopefully,
Stan will understand.

09:32.608 --> 09:34.375
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

09:34.443 --> 09:36.511
I-I-I-I don't-I don't think we tell Stan.

09:36.578 --> 09:38.913
He's my best friend and I,
I betrayed him.

09:38.981 --> 09:41.182
Roger, I've got to
be up front with him.

09:41.250 --> 09:44.152
Oh, like he was when he didn't
tell you he was an ice dancer?

09:44.219 --> 09:46.020
'Member? It was his
"winter secret"?

09:46.088 --> 09:47.922
Well, this'll be your fall secret.

09:47.990 --> 09:49.557
Seasonal secrets.

09:49.625 --> 09:51.859
I was thinking of opening
a boutique with that name.

09:51.927 --> 09:53.928
God, to open a boutique!

09:53.996 --> 09:57.198
Look, if I don't tell Stan
and he ever found out,

09:57.266 --> 09:58.900
then this thing that meant nothing

09:58.967 --> 10:00.735
would suddenly mean something.

10:00.802 --> 10:02.737
Francine, please,
just think about it, okay?

10:02.804 --> 10:05.439
Okay, I'll think about it.

10:05.507 --> 10:06.774
Excuse me.

10:06.842 --> 10:08.776
Is Smuckers produced locally?

10:08.844 --> 10:11.179
Um... No, it's not.

10:14.116 --> 10:15.583
He's coming. Throw it.

10:17.553 --> 10:18.986
The red ball!

10:19.054 --> 10:21.088
Oh, my God! This is the
most real dream yet!

10:21.156 --> 10:23.057
Wait, can this be a dream?

10:23.125 --> 10:24.192
Who stole the tarts?

10:24.259 --> 10:26.260
Who stole the tarts?

10:26.328 --> 10:29.564
Boy, did you see a short giraffe
with a mouthful of muffin?

10:29.631 --> 10:30.965
This is awesome!

10:32.868 --> 10:35.102
Hayley, give me lunch money.

10:35.170 --> 10:37.538
Now, ask Snot on a date.

10:37.606 --> 10:39.440
Hi, it's Hayley.

10:39.508 --> 10:40.908
Will you go out with me?

10:40.976 --> 10:42.176
Oh, my God, yes!

10:42.244 --> 10:43.444
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my...

10:45.013 --> 10:46.814
Today, school is a pajama party.

10:46.882 --> 10:49.217
I think I'll fly there.

10:49.284 --> 10:52.486
Or, or you could force me
to be your chauffeur slave.

10:52.554 --> 10:55.523
Yes, that seems more
appropriate for the dream king.

11:00.696 --> 11:02.129
Run all the lights!

11:02.197 --> 11:03.764
It's my dream. Nothing can hurt us.

11:03.832 --> 11:05.233
But don't drive too fast.

11:05.300 --> 11:07.802
I need about 15 for
a little Steve time.

11:09.938 --> 11:11.672
We are getting away with this.

11:11.740 --> 11:13.174
No talking!

11:15.978 --> 11:19.146
Say, I was just thinking again
about the whole kiss thing.

11:19.214 --> 11:22.016
Anyhoo, I bet you decided
not to tell Stan.

11:22.084 --> 11:23.818
Actually, I think he should know.

11:23.885 --> 11:25.653
Why? He blew you off.

11:25.721 --> 11:27.555
I shouldn't even have
been on this trip.

11:27.623 --> 11:29.890
Of course, it's no surprise.
He's just not romantic.

11:29.958 --> 11:32.493
Big romantic surprise!

11:32.561 --> 11:34.328
Oh, baby.

11:34.396 --> 11:35.463
Oh, no.

11:35.530 --> 11:38.165
I missed my girl
and my best friend.

11:38.233 --> 11:39.700
Blow me? You bet!

11:41.703 --> 11:43.204
Yeah! Yeah!

11:43.272 --> 11:44.972
That bartender Mia
told me where you'd be.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.874
She remembered you, Roger.

11:46.942 --> 11:49.443
I think she's into you,
but she thought you were with Francine.

11:49.511 --> 11:52.446
Funny you should say that,
because last night...

11:52.514 --> 11:55.216
Oh! How clumsy of me.

11:55.284 --> 11:57.385
I'm still getting used
to my artificial foot.

11:57.452 --> 11:58.653
Don't worry about it.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.321
I'll wash it out in the bathroom.

12:01.590 --> 12:04.425
That lady's knockers!

12:04.493 --> 12:05.993
Boy!

12:08.630 --> 12:10.598
Those damn Sweet Petes!

12:10.666 --> 12:12.066
You have any trouble
with them last night?

12:12.134 --> 12:14.435
No, no, last night was
pretty uneventful.

12:14.503 --> 12:16.504
Hey, you want to go?
Aren't we waiting for Francine?

12:16.571 --> 12:17.772
Oh, she just texted me.

12:17.839 --> 12:19.674
She ran into a friend
from camp in the bathroom.

12:19.741 --> 12:20.808
She'll meet us at the next place.

12:20.876 --> 12:22.376
Race you to the car!

12:25.847 --> 12:27.415
Where are you guys going?

12:29.251 --> 12:31.085
Please, Francine!

12:31.153 --> 12:33.354
I'm telling him, Roger.

12:33.422 --> 12:34.955
Stan...

12:35.023 --> 12:36.324
I-I want to be where the action is.

12:36.391 --> 12:38.125
Sing free-form jazz with me.

12:44.466 --> 12:46.233
♪ ♪

13:17.265 --> 13:19.433
Good show, Roger.

13:19.501 --> 13:21.502
I'm going to go buy us
matching golf shirts.

13:21.570 --> 13:22.970
What, what are you?
A large? Medium?

13:23.038 --> 13:24.872
Boy's husky.

13:26.241 --> 13:27.141
Stan!

13:29.311 --> 13:30.711
Come on, Francine.

13:30.779 --> 13:32.713
Can't you give me this one thing?

13:32.781 --> 13:34.582
He's my best friend in the world.

13:34.649 --> 13:36.217
My mind's made up.

13:36.284 --> 13:38.953
He's going to take
my necklace away.

13:41.123 --> 13:43.958
Frannie, I just need a
little time to think.

13:44.025 --> 13:45.559
Maybe you do, too, huh?

13:45.627 --> 13:47.661
Now, we both have a
little time to think.

13:48.897 --> 13:51.031
Thinking's good.

13:51.099 --> 13:53.033
Thinking's what rational people do.

13:56.338 --> 13:57.805
I got you a woman's small.

13:57.873 --> 13:59.473
I had a fat kid try it on.

13:59.541 --> 14:01.175
It looked great on him, so...

14:01.243 --> 14:02.510
Thanks, bud.

14:02.577 --> 14:04.211
And by the way,
Francine said she was pooped,

14:04.279 --> 14:06.247
so she went to the
spa for a mud bath.

14:06.314 --> 14:08.115
FRANCINE Help!

14:08.183 --> 14:09.683
You hear screaming? Screaming?

14:09.751 --> 14:11.452
Yeah, I hear it. It's my calves.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.053
We rented bikes yesterday.

14:13.121 --> 14:15.322
Did 50 miles.
They are howling, bud.

14:22.735 --> 14:24.036
Hey, Roger!

14:24.199 --> 14:25.532
Sit up here at the bar.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.001
Yech, don't stop.

14:27.068 --> 14:28.802
We're actually going
to order some food.

14:28.870 --> 14:31.171
I serve the full menu right here.

14:31.239 --> 14:33.774
Stop it, Mia. You know
your face is gross to me.

14:33.842 --> 14:34.975
Don't make me talk about that.

14:36.311 --> 14:37.811
When's Francine back from the spa?

14:37.879 --> 14:39.046
Could take weeks.

14:39.114 --> 14:40.914
She's getting the Tom
and Jerry Cleanse.

14:40.982 --> 14:43.217
They send a hungry field
mouse up her waa-waa,

14:43.285 --> 14:45.619
let it go to town, then they
send a cat in after the mouse.

14:45.687 --> 14:47.955
It's a long process.
You're funny, man.

14:48.023 --> 14:49.323
Order me the hamburger salad.

14:49.391 --> 14:50.591
I'm going to shower up.

14:53.428 --> 14:54.928
How you been, Rog?

14:54.996 --> 14:56.864
Do I know you? It's Mark.

14:56.931 --> 14:59.566
Remember, I paid for the chocolate you
got caught stealing at the winery.

14:59.634 --> 15:00.701
You were there with your wife.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.002
That wasn't my wife!

15:02.070 --> 15:03.570
That was my best buddy's wife

15:03.638 --> 15:05.039
and I ended up kissing her.

15:05.106 --> 15:07.608
When he finds out,
our friendship's going to be over.

15:07.676 --> 15:10.177
Not necessarily.
Just let your buddy

15:10.245 --> 15:12.713
kiss your girl and
then you'll be even.

15:12.781 --> 15:15.349
Oh, yeah, that'd be great,
but I don't have a girlfriend.

15:23.425 --> 15:24.591
Hey, beautiful.

15:24.659 --> 15:26.427
You free tonight?
Of course you're free.

15:26.494 --> 15:29.163
Now, go home and put on your
best Disneyland sweatshirt.

15:29.230 --> 15:30.397
We're going out.

15:37.305 --> 15:39.106
Don't panic. I'm just
keeping you down there

15:39.174 --> 15:40.541
until I can fix things.

15:41.876 --> 15:43.243
And I got you food.

15:43.311 --> 15:46.246
Sun Fresh chips,
right? And a sandwich.

15:50.919 --> 15:52.853
Did you get it?

15:52.921 --> 15:54.621
Hello?

15:54.689 --> 15:56.290
Is the sandwich stuck in the pipe?

15:56.358 --> 15:57.958
Did you get any of the chips?

15:58.026 --> 15:59.493
They're Sun Fresh chips.

15:59.561 --> 16:01.595
They're healthy for you.
Healthier than regular chips.

16:01.663 --> 16:03.864
Oh! No, they are not.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.407
Yo, yo!

16:13.475 --> 16:15.542
I stopped for burgers
after I choked it.

16:17.078 --> 16:18.679
Are we going too far with this?

16:18.747 --> 16:20.581
I sure hope so.

16:21.783 --> 16:23.684
Steve, it's almost 1:00.

16:23.752 --> 16:25.386
Get a load of Big Ben.

16:28.123 --> 16:29.223
I know what time it is.

16:32.494 --> 16:35.095
I'm going to go get
Principal Lewis.

16:37.999 --> 16:40.100
Yo, girl. You're my lab partner.

16:40.168 --> 16:42.069
But I'm paired up with Dennis.

16:43.605 --> 16:46.106
Dennis is paired up
with the floor now.

16:48.143 --> 16:50.577
Steve, you're so crazy today.

16:50.645 --> 16:54.381
You think that's crazy,
wait till you see this!

16:54.449 --> 16:55.816
Let's fly!

16:55.884 --> 16:56.884
Nein! No, don't!

16:59.087 --> 17:00.254
I don't want to look.

17:00.321 --> 17:01.622
Does my leg look broken?

17:01.689 --> 17:03.791
Aah, my God!

17:07.595 --> 17:09.762
So, where do you want to go?

17:09.830 --> 17:11.932
I thought we'd just hang
here with my buddy Stan.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.067
He's super fun. Great kisser.

17:14.135 --> 17:16.336
Stan, you old bastard, get in here!

17:16.404 --> 17:18.771
This is my very serious
girlfriend Mia.

17:18.839 --> 17:19.839
We're friends.

17:19.907 --> 17:21.308
It's okay to kiss hello.

17:21.376 --> 17:22.276
What's a kiss? Nothing!

17:22.343 --> 17:23.510
Means you're friends.

17:23.578 --> 17:26.246
Wine country! Tequila all around!

17:33.588 --> 17:35.122
To kissing!

17:38.092 --> 17:39.693
Come on. Group kiss!

17:39.761 --> 17:41.462
I kiss Mia, I kiss Stan.

17:41.529 --> 17:42.896
Everybody's kissing!

17:42.964 --> 17:44.465
You guys kiss!

17:44.532 --> 17:46.867
I'm just gonna use
the john real quick.

17:48.336 --> 17:49.703
What are you doing
just sitting there?!

17:49.771 --> 17:50.938
You're the worst date.

17:51.005 --> 17:52.272
Go kiss him while he's pooping.

17:52.340 --> 17:54.241
You know, give him a
San Diego thank you.

17:57.111 --> 17:59.513
♪ Lips are for kissing,
uh, uh-uh! ♪

17:59.581 --> 18:01.348
♪ Lips are for kissing,

18:01.416 --> 18:03.484
You guys like that song,
"Lips Are For Kissing"?

18:03.551 --> 18:04.885
Kiss if you like that song.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.487
I think I should go.

18:07.889 --> 18:09.690
You can't leave without a kiss.

18:09.757 --> 18:12.960
Come on. Go tongue-blast
his baloney hole!

18:13.027 --> 18:15.028
Hey, bro, I wouldn't be
too broken up about her.

18:15.096 --> 18:16.330
I was waiting to tell ya,

18:16.397 --> 18:18.065
but she tried to kiss
me on the toilet.

18:18.132 --> 18:19.666
A little kiss?

18:19.734 --> 18:20.968
You thought I'd care?

18:21.035 --> 18:22.603
No, we're friends, so it's okay.

18:22.670 --> 18:24.104
Not in <i>my</i> book.

18:24.172 --> 18:25.973
That makes it especially not okay.

18:26.040 --> 18:27.140
Remember these?

18:27.208 --> 18:28.475
Best friends forever, man.

18:33.548 --> 18:36.483
Stan, something
happened last night.

18:36.551 --> 18:37.885
You're not gonna like it,

18:37.952 --> 18:39.620
but I have to tell you the truth.

18:42.690 --> 18:45.392
Stan, I have something to tell you.

18:45.460 --> 18:47.160
Roger already told me.

18:47.228 --> 18:50.063
Really? Yes,
all the sordid details.

18:50.131 --> 18:51.932
Well, it wasn't sordid.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.301
It was just a stupid little kiss.

18:54.369 --> 18:55.969
So you admit it! You kissed Roger!

18:56.037 --> 18:57.204
What?! No!

18:57.272 --> 18:58.205
<i>He</i> kissed <i>me!</i>

18:58.273 --> 18:59.273
Lie.

18:59.340 --> 19:01.408
I've been trying to
tell you all day.

19:01.476 --> 19:02.809
All day? I've been waiting

19:02.877 --> 19:04.511
all day for you to come clean!

19:04.579 --> 19:06.513
But you went to the spa

19:06.581 --> 19:07.948
to ease your guilty conscience.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.050
Well, I couldn't leave my
buddy hanging any longer!

19:10.118 --> 19:11.885
Stan, this is crazy!

19:11.953 --> 19:14.755
He kissed me,
and then he buried me alive!

19:14.822 --> 19:16.823
Good try. We know
you had a mud bath.

19:16.891 --> 19:18.458
In my clothes?

19:18.526 --> 19:20.861
Yeah, you ruined a
perfectly fine dress

19:20.929 --> 19:22.930
your hardworking
husband bought you.

19:22.997 --> 19:24.197
I <i>do</i> work hard.

19:24.265 --> 19:26.466
He's lying, Stan!

19:26.534 --> 19:27.534
No, I'm not.

19:27.602 --> 19:31.204
Stan, this is a high-five truth.

19:31.272 --> 19:33.674
This is ridiculous.

19:33.741 --> 19:35.075
Francine, I'm sorry.

19:35.143 --> 19:37.511
If I hid this from
Stan and he found out,

19:37.579 --> 19:39.513
then this thing that meant nothing

19:39.581 --> 19:40.914
would suddenly mean something.

19:40.982 --> 19:42.849
That's what <i>I</i> told
<i>you!</i>

19:42.917 --> 19:43.984
I'll kill you!

19:44.052 --> 19:45.452
Leave him alone, Francine.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.954
Roger's a true friend.

19:48.489 --> 19:50.357
These bike shorts are dry.

19:50.425 --> 19:52.092
Why don't they take 'em down?

19:52.160 --> 19:55.062
Hey, Room 23, your shorts!

19:57.231 --> 19:59.132
Who knows how many
guys she was with

19:59.200 --> 20:00.233
who <i>weren't</i> my best buddy

20:00.301 --> 20:01.335
and didn't tell me?

20:01.402 --> 20:03.770
Yeah, yeah, probably a lot.

20:03.838 --> 20:06.373
I've put so much
into this marriage.

20:06.441 --> 20:08.542
God, now it looks like divorce.

20:08.610 --> 20:10.744
Half of all marriages
end in divorce.

20:10.812 --> 20:12.212
But it's so terrible!

20:12.280 --> 20:13.413
First, there's the kids!

20:13.481 --> 20:14.781
The poor kids!

20:14.849 --> 20:15.949
It'll make them stronger.

20:16.017 --> 20:17.017
Then the house,

20:17.085 --> 20:18.485
we'll have to sell the house!

20:18.553 --> 20:20.354
It's just stuff, man. Things.

20:20.421 --> 20:22.222
Which means no more attic for you.

20:22.290 --> 20:23.590
Beg pardon?

20:23.658 --> 20:25.392
I mean, where will you live?!

20:25.460 --> 20:26.460
This affects everyone!

20:26.527 --> 20:28.228
Whoa, what's this?

20:28.296 --> 20:30.063
Is the sidewall cracking?

20:30.131 --> 20:32.566
Shouldn't be. I just got these.

20:32.634 --> 20:35.102
Okay, Stan, now I can tell you:

20:35.169 --> 20:38.739
you don't have to get
divorced and sell the attic

20:38.806 --> 20:40.741
because I was the one
who kissed Francine.

20:40.808 --> 20:43.343
But it didn't mean anything.
It was just a drunken slipup.

20:43.411 --> 20:45.846
Damn it, Roger!
Get me the hell out of here!

20:45.913 --> 20:48.315
I'm just gonna give you
some time to cool off.

20:48.383 --> 20:49.216
I'm gonna rip your head off!

20:49.284 --> 20:50.651
Okay, so you need more time.

20:59.935 --> 21:02.436
Not the necklace!

21:02.504 --> 21:04.071
Ow.

21:07.109 --> 21:08.776
They're beautiful, Stan.

21:08.844 --> 21:10.611
<i>You're</i> beautiful, baby.

21:10.679 --> 21:12.413
<i>You're</i> beautiful.

21:14.332 --> 21:16.367
I can't believe you did this to me.

21:16.435 --> 21:18.636
Amy's family might prosecute
me for attempted murder.

21:19.905 --> 21:21.405
You wore your underwear to school.

21:27.312 --> 21:30.648
Wow, Hayley, you look beautiful.

21:30.715 --> 21:32.416
What are you talking about?

21:32.484 --> 21:33.417
I shaved.

21:33.485 --> 21:35.286
I'm here for our date.

21:35.353 --> 21:38.522
I sold all my toys to rent a limo.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.524
No.
