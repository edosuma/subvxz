WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.420
This isn't fair.

00:02.085 --> 00:03.420
Yes, it is.

00:03.462 --> 00:04.463
It's absolutely fair.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.047
I'm getting hungry.

00:06.089 --> 00:07.090
We're doing it my way.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.425
They're getting cold.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.135
You want them

00:08.467 --> 00:10.135
divided up fairly or not?

00:10.177 --> 00:12.137
You have more than me.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.137
No, I don't.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.222
We all have 29 inches

00:12.179 --> 00:14.222
of fries so far.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.558
I have two four-inchers,

00:14.264 --> 00:16.558
five three-inchers

00:16.600 --> 00:17.977
and three two-inchers.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.896
You have five five-inchers

00:18.018 --> 00:20.896
and a four-incher.

00:20.938 --> 00:22.356
They're exactly the same.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.733
Dewey!

00:24.775 --> 00:26.318
Okay, we're going to assume

00:26.360 --> 00:29.070
this was a four-incher

00:26.360 --> 00:29.070
from the share pile.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.155
117 minus three,

00:30.197 --> 00:33.074
times 29, divided by three,

00:30.197 --> 00:33.074
minus...

00:33.116 --> 00:35.202
We each take a two-inch bite

00:33.116 --> 00:35.202
out of this one.

00:36.328 --> 00:38.956
Last week, we

00:36.328 --> 00:38.956
had curly fries.

00:38.998 --> 00:41.082
It took us

00:38.998 --> 00:41.082
three hours.

Good job, Don!

(boys shouting, Malcolm panting)

01:25.002 --> 01:27.337
BOY:

01:25.002 --> 01:27.337
Center it!

01:31.759 --> 01:34.135
Aw, man.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.136
He's wide open!

01:35.178 --> 01:36.972
Shoot, shoot!

01:35.178 --> 01:36.972
There it is!

01:38.766 --> 01:41.476
In your... face.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.563
(panting)

01:46.398 --> 01:49.276
BOY:

01:46.398 --> 01:49.276
I got it, I got it!

Car!

02:07.252 --> 02:09.546
Good... game.

02:09.588 --> 02:12.173
This... sucks.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.259
You... mocking me?

02:14.301 --> 02:17.096
No... tired.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.681
Get... skates.

02:19.723 --> 02:20.975
Can't.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.643
Dad.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.396
My dad was some kind

02:24.519 --> 02:26.396
of skating champion

02:26.438 --> 02:28.107
a long time ago.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.817
He made a rule--

02:28.148 --> 02:29.817
no one in the family

02:29.858 --> 02:32.235
could buy skates until after

02:29.858 --> 02:32.235
they take lessons from him.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.655
So take... the lessons.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.239
You don't get it.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.700
My dad's, like, a total

02:36.281 --> 02:38.700
fanatic about skating.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.368
He doesn't even

02:38.742 --> 02:40.368
call it skating.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.578
He calls it...

02:41.620 --> 02:43.204
"The Brotherhood

02:41.620 --> 02:43.204
of the Wheel."

02:43.246 --> 02:44.581
He taught Francis

02:43.246 --> 02:44.581
and Reese,

02:44.623 --> 02:46.583
and they've never

02:44.623 --> 02:46.583
been the same after.

02:46.625 --> 02:47.918
Gretzky shoots!

02:47.960 --> 02:49.210
He scores!

02:49.252 --> 02:51.922
He laughs

02:49.252 --> 02:51.922
at the other Canadians!

02:51.964 --> 02:53.841
Hey, Reese, remember

02:51.964 --> 02:53.841
when Dad taught you

02:53.882 --> 02:54.925
how to skate?

02:54.967 --> 02:56.510
I don't want to talk about it.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.221
Why can't you just tell me

02:58.261 --> 03:00.221
what it was like?

03:00.263 --> 03:01.807
One, I'm not

03:00.263 --> 03:01.807
supposed to,

03:01.849 --> 03:04.225
and two, I don't even like

03:01.849 --> 03:04.225
to think about it.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.519
It makes me cry.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.812
Hey, hey, hey!

03:06.854 --> 03:08.522
What's wrong with you?

03:08.563 --> 03:11.066
You know you're not supposed

03:08.563 --> 03:11.066
to skate in the house.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.610
Why? Everyone else

03:11.108 --> 03:13.610
in the world gets to.

03:13.652 --> 03:16.237
Wait a minute.

03:13.652 --> 03:16.237
Somebody stepped in something.

03:16.279 --> 03:19.116
Oh, my God.

03:19.158 --> 03:23.037
Oh, my God! What a mess!

03:23.078 --> 03:24.245
Reese...

03:24.287 --> 03:26.748
what did you roll in?

03:26.790 --> 03:28.375
Oh, man.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.588
(groaning, panting)

03:35.966 --> 03:38.468
You have to admit,

03:35.966 --> 03:38.468
it  is  kind of funny--

03:38.510 --> 03:42.014
yelling so loud you actually

03:38.510 --> 03:42.014
throw out your back.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.643
Just try to relax.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.270
Got the baby monitor

03:46.685 --> 03:49.270
all set up here.

03:49.312 --> 03:52.315
Now, if you need

03:49.312 --> 03:52.315
anything, just holler--

03:52.357 --> 03:53.942
but not too loud--

03:53.984 --> 03:56.319
and I will get on it.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.363
(shrieks)

03:59.322 --> 04:00.365
Oh, God.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.283
Sorry. Sorry.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.283
Oh, God.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.703
Lois, why don't you just take

04:02.325 --> 04:04.703
the pain medicine

04:04.745 --> 04:05.746
the doctor gave you?

04:05.787 --> 04:07.330
Because they make me loopy.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.666
I will not have this house

04:07.372 --> 04:09.666
come crashing down around me

04:09.708 --> 04:11.585
because I'm hopped up

04:09.708 --> 04:11.585
on goofballs.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.295
Mom, I'm really sorry.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.505
Are you okay?

04:15.547 --> 04:18.050
Oh, Reese, come to mama.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.803
Closer, sweetheart.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.014
Are you happy

04:21.845 --> 04:24.014
you crippled your mother?

04:24.056 --> 04:25.015
Mom...

04:25.057 --> 04:26.100
Are you?

04:26.141 --> 04:27.726
Mom. Mom. Ow!

04:29.561 --> 04:31.605
Survival weekend?

04:31.646 --> 04:33.314
What does that mean?

04:33.356 --> 04:34.524
That means we

04:33.356 --> 04:34.524
get to spend

04:34.566 --> 04:36.317
two whole days out

04:34.566 --> 04:36.317
in the wilderness

04:36.359 --> 04:38.112
with limited supplies

04:36.359 --> 04:38.112
and no food.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.154
You're kidding, right?

04:39.196 --> 04:40.822
No.

04:40.864 --> 04:43.324
It's an excellent way to learn

04:40.864 --> 04:43.324
basic survival techniques.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.244
It's two days in the woods.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.328
Our parents are paying

04:45.285 --> 04:47.328
for room and board.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.413
Where does that money go?

04:48.455 --> 04:49.581
Sounds like a big scam.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.626
Maybe so, but you're doing it.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.418
What?

04:53.460 --> 04:54.753
Francis, I let you

04:54.795 --> 04:56.337
blow off a lot of things

04:54.795 --> 04:56.337
around here,

04:56.379 --> 04:58.048
but this is something

04:56.379 --> 04:58.048
I believe in.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.340
It's a character builder.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.717
I think it'll be good for you.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.137
How could it be good for me?

05:03.178 --> 05:04.721
No food, no shelter.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.223
No broken clavicles.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.892
That's something

05:06.265 --> 05:08.892
inside me, right?

05:18.277 --> 05:20.528
LOIS:

05:18.277 --> 05:20.528
What are you doing?!

05:20.570 --> 05:21.738
Nothing.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.865
Get a glass.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.201
Don't you dare!

05:26.243 --> 05:27.368
When I get well, I am going

05:27.410 --> 05:28.662
to beat you blue, mister.

05:28.703 --> 05:29.955
Get a glass!

05:29.997 --> 05:31.290
All right. Okay.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.751
Can I have some milk?

05:34.793 --> 05:36.377
Yes, but get a glass.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.963
Okay.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.256
Hello, Francis.

05:39.298 --> 05:40.257
I have a problem.

05:40.299 --> 05:41.591
I need your advice.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.593
Trust me, pal, whatever

05:41.633 --> 05:43.593
you're going through

05:43.635 --> 05:45.386
is not half as bad

05:43.635 --> 05:45.386
as what I'm facing.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.472
I'm thinking of asking Dad

05:45.428 --> 05:47.472
for skating lessons.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.431
(inhales sharply)

05:48.473 --> 05:49.850
Why does everyone do that?

05:49.891 --> 05:51.392
What does he do?

05:51.434 --> 05:53.645
Look, if I told you,

05:51.434 --> 05:53.645
you'd just freak out,

05:53.687 --> 05:55.438
but if you think you're ready,

05:55.480 --> 05:57.774
my advice is

05:55.480 --> 05:57.774
to get it over with quickly.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.694
It's like pulling a giant

05:57.816 --> 06:00.694
Band-Aid off your crotch.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.654
I'm going to have a Band-Aid

06:00.735 --> 06:02.654
on my crotch?

06:02.696 --> 06:03.905
Who are you

06:02.696 --> 06:03.905
talking to?

06:03.947 --> 06:05.282
Francis.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.410
Hi, sweetie.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.913
Hi, Mom.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.913
Oh, I am in such pain

06:09.452 --> 06:11.913
because of my back.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.249
Doctor says I have to stay

06:11.955 --> 06:14.249
in bed for at least three days

06:11.955 --> 06:14.249
Mom...

06:14.291 --> 06:15.667
with my leg up on a pillow

06:15.709 --> 06:17.294
and then I'm supposed

06:15.709 --> 06:17.294
to put ice on it.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.419
Ice, not heat.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.419
Look, Mom.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.130
Have you ever heard

06:18.461 --> 06:20.130
of such a thing?

06:20.172 --> 06:21.589
I never heard of such a thing.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.633
That doesn't make

06:21.631 --> 06:23.633
any sense to me.

06:37.856 --> 06:41.235
Oh, thanks, honey.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.277
Here we go.

06:42.319 --> 06:43.362
One more thing.

06:42.319 --> 06:43.362
Huh?

06:43.402 --> 06:44.321
Yeah?

06:44.363 --> 06:47.241
Stop trying to drug my food.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.450
Oh.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.535
Where was I?

06:50.577 --> 06:51.661
Francis?

06:51.703 --> 06:52.829
Where wa...?

06:52.871 --> 06:54.039
Uh, your back.

06:54.081 --> 06:54.956
Oh, yeah.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.166
So they say that my fourth

06:56.208 --> 06:57.918
and fifth vertebrae

06:56.208 --> 06:57.918
are out of alignment.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.336
Apparently my shoulder muscles

06:57.959 --> 06:59.336
are asymmetrical.

06:59.378 --> 07:01.046
I mean, did you ever hear

06:59.378 --> 07:01.046
of such a thing?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.463
They say it's genetic.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.631
It's the first case

07:02.505 --> 07:03.631
of scream-induced

07:03.673 --> 07:05.384
back trauma they've ever seen.

07:05.424 --> 07:06.676
I swear, they paraded

07:05.424 --> 07:06.676
every Tom, Dick and Harry

07:06.718 --> 07:08.095
through that room

07:06.718 --> 07:08.095
to take a look at me.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.470
And me, I'm just lying there

07:09.512 --> 07:11.265
with that little flimsy

07:09.512 --> 07:11.265
paper thing on me

07:11.306 --> 07:14.059
with my rear end flapping in the

07:11.306 --> 07:14.059
breeze for all the world to see.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.476
HAL:

07:14.101 --> 07:15.476
Boys, they're called...

07:15.518 --> 07:16.895
Gut-busters.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.898
They take a sausage,

07:16.937 --> 07:19.898
stuff it with cheese,

07:19.940 --> 07:21.316
wrap it with bacon,

07:21.358 --> 07:23.860
and shove it in

07:21.358 --> 07:23.860
a deep-fat fryer

07:23.902 --> 07:25.195
full of lard.

07:25.237 --> 07:26.487
They're indescribable.

07:26.529 --> 07:27.697
Bon appetit.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.119
Malcolm, where

07:30.700 --> 07:32.119
have you been?

07:32.160 --> 07:33.412
You got to get

07:32.160 --> 07:33.412
in on this.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.455
Dad... I want skating lessons.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.753
Son, do you know,

07:39.334 --> 07:41.753
once you start

07:41.795 --> 07:43.713
there's no going back?

07:43.755 --> 07:45.590
I know.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.759
This means

07:45.632 --> 07:47.759
total commitment.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.677
Once you begin the path,

07:49.719 --> 07:52.013
there is no

07:49.719 --> 07:52.013
leaving the path.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.682
Are you sure you're

07:52.055 --> 07:54.682
ready for that?

07:54.724 --> 07:56.476
I mean really ready?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.229
I-I guess so.

07:59.271 --> 08:00.230
Neat.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.898
We'll start tomorrow.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.567
Come on, dig in

08:01.940 --> 08:04.567
before they harden.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.538
Let's do it.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.791
Stretch.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.127
Nose to knees,

08:19.833 --> 08:22.127
nose to knees,

08:22.169 --> 08:23.544
and... release.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.838
Ooh.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.547
You feeling a

08:24.879 --> 08:26.547
little limber now?

08:26.589 --> 08:27.841
Mostly I feel sleepy.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.550
Well, we have

08:27.882 --> 08:29.550
to start early.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.552
We've got a lot of

08:29.592 --> 08:31.552
ground to cover.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.804
Rule number one:

08:32.846 --> 08:34.764
you can't question my ways.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.557
I'm the top skate-dog.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.976
Understood?

08:38.018 --> 08:40.603
You may not like my methods,

08:40.645 --> 08:43.273
but let me just show you

08:40.645 --> 08:43.273
what you can accomplish

08:43.315 --> 08:44.565
if you stick with it.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.236
(sniffs)

08:48.278 --> 08:49.570
(blows air)

08:54.451 --> 08:57.829
(disco music playing)

09:33.698 --> 09:36.993
Should I be impressed

09:33.698 --> 09:36.993
or horrified?

09:37.035 --> 09:40.247
Dad, that was unbelievable.

09:40.288 --> 09:43.708
Whew! That routine won me a gold

09:40.288 --> 09:43.708
medal, a macramé plant hanger,

09:43.750 --> 09:46.711
and your mother's heart,

09:43.750 --> 09:46.711
all in the same afternoon.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.338
What to see your skates?

09:48.380 --> 09:49.297
Yeah.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.465
Come on.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.217
I prefer

09:50.507 --> 09:52.217
a Saratoga four-wide,

09:52.259 --> 09:54.052
but I know

09:52.259 --> 09:54.052
you kids like that

09:54.094 --> 09:55.636
in-line stuff.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.637
So...

09:56.679 --> 09:59.933
Whoa! They're beautiful!

09:59.974 --> 10:01.726
They are, aren't they?

10:01.768 --> 10:05.730
Wait, I don't get to wear them?

10:05.772 --> 10:09.276
Oh, no... you're not ready

10:05.772 --> 10:09.276
for those just yet.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.652
That's just your incentive.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.281
One step

10:11.694 --> 10:14.281
at a time, Malcolm.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.824
Roll to the gold. Huh?

10:16.866 --> 10:18.868
You're going to start

10:16.866 --> 10:18.868
with these.

10:21.704 --> 10:22.872
Why do I have to...

10:21.704 --> 10:22.872
Ah-ah-ah.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.458
Top skate-dog.

10:24.499 --> 10:27.085
Now, let's see you skate

10:24.499 --> 10:27.085
through those cones.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.880
I don't have skates.

10:30.922 --> 10:35.093
Your skates are in here.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.304
Go on.

10:37.345 --> 10:40.348
HAL:

10:37.345 --> 10:40.348
Glide... and glide...

10:40.390 --> 10:43.268
let your arms work with--

10:40.390 --> 10:43.268
slow down.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.229
Slower.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.229
Slower!

10:47.188 --> 10:48.689
This is going to rule.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.691
All I'm taking is a canteen,

10:50.733 --> 10:54.279
a knife, my bedroll

10:50.733 --> 10:54.279
and some emergency rations.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.280
Wuss.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.699
Canteen, knife,

10:55.322 --> 10:58.699
survival blanket.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.076
That's all?

11:00.118 --> 11:02.454
Dude, hard-core.

11:10.629 --> 11:11.712
Let's rock.

11:13.798 --> 11:17.676
You ready?

11:13.798 --> 11:17.676
Ready as I'll ever be.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.645
(screams)

11:26.685 --> 11:29.022
What is it?

11:29.063 --> 11:30.106
My back.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.107
I can't move.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.733
It happens sometimes.

11:32.775 --> 11:33.734
It's genetic.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.446
My shoulder muscles

11:33.776 --> 11:36.446
are asymmetrical,

11:36.488 --> 11:39.698
and it pulls my vertebrae

11:36.488 --> 11:39.698
out of alignment.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.743
I'll be fine.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.330
I just need to ice it.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.332
Which vertebrae?

11:47.374 --> 11:48.791
Fourth and fifth.

11:48.833 --> 11:49.959
All right.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.961
Take him to his room.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.174
HAL: Hands out front

11:54.088 --> 11:56.174
so you get a balance.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.634
Hold it... hold it.

11:57.676 --> 11:58.968
Why am I doing this?

11:59.010 --> 12:00.761
Stop clouding your mind.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.180
This is a process.

12:02.222 --> 12:06.142
Dad, it's street hockey,

12:02.222 --> 12:06.142
not clown school.

12:06.184 --> 12:10.271
Process... and one

12:06.184 --> 12:10.271
and down and over.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.773
When am I ever

12:10.313 --> 12:12.773
going to use this?

12:12.815 --> 12:14.359
Full range of motion,

12:14.401 --> 12:16.986
and point and bump,

12:17.028 --> 12:18.488
and point and bump,

12:18.530 --> 12:19.738
and then we glide.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.033
How about my skates?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.784
Can I at least

12:22.075 --> 12:23.784
try on my skates?

12:23.826 --> 12:24.785
Absolutely not.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.287
You need at least

12:24.827 --> 12:26.287
two more days.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.372
Two days?

12:27.414 --> 12:28.373
Uh-huh.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.374
I know enough

12:29.416 --> 12:30.833
to play a stupid game

12:29.416 --> 12:30.833
of street hockey now.

12:30.875 --> 12:31.959
That's all I care about.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.628
Malcolm, we go at

12:32.001 --> 12:33.628
the speed I say.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.880
This is about safety

12:33.670 --> 12:35.880
and proper technique.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.591
But it doesn't

12:35.922 --> 12:37.591
make any sense.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.967
That's because you're not

12:37.632 --> 12:39.967
in a skating state of mind.

12:40.009 --> 12:40.885
Now, that's it. Okay?

12:40.927 --> 12:41.886
We're done. Go home.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.263
You know what?

12:43.304 --> 12:45.515
Thanks to your attitude,

12:45.557 --> 12:47.808
we are now a day behind.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.102
Fine!

12:54.315 --> 12:56.817
The boy's fighting me, Lois.

12:56.859 --> 13:01.114
Oh, he's got the talent,

12:56.859 --> 13:01.114
but he's reckless and wild.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.990
Fine. I'll

13:01.155 --> 13:02.990
talk to him.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.492
That's not what I'm asking.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.077
Well, that's what

13:04.534 --> 13:06.077
going to ha...

13:06.119 --> 13:07.078
(groans in pain)

13:07.120 --> 13:10.331
Would you just take

13:07.120 --> 13:10.331
the darn pill... dear?

13:10.373 --> 13:12.459
I can't believe

13:10.373 --> 13:12.459
he cut me off.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.001
You questioned his ways.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.836
Never question his ways.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.547
That just makes it

13:15.878 --> 13:17.547
take even longer.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.466
You going to go

13:17.589 --> 13:19.466
play hockey?

13:17.589 --> 13:19.466
You bet.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.925
I'll see you out there...

13:20.967 --> 13:22.302
in a month or two.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.858
I don't know how yet,

13:37.900 --> 13:40.861
but there's definitely a way

13:37.900 --> 13:40.861
I can justify this.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.156
Malcolm!

13:43.197 --> 13:44.574
Dang, I thought

13:43.197 --> 13:44.574
I'd at least

13:44.616 --> 13:46.701
get a few minutes in

13:44.616 --> 13:46.701
before he busted me.

13:46.743 --> 13:47.868
You know what?

13:46.743 --> 13:47.868
Screw it.

13:47.910 --> 13:48.869
I'm sick of this.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.330
What do you think

13:48.911 --> 13:50.330
you're doing?

13:50.371 --> 13:52.165
Taking my skates

13:50.371 --> 13:52.165
to go play hockey.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.334
Absolutely not;

13:52.206 --> 13:54.334
we had an agreement.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.335
Agreement?

13:55.376 --> 13:57.504
You just like

13:55.376 --> 13:57.504
bossing me around!

13:57.545 --> 13:59.589
And you like fighting me

13:57.545 --> 13:59.589
every step of the way!

13:59.631 --> 14:01.549
Because you're treating

13:59.631 --> 14:01.549
me like a baby!

14:01.591 --> 14:03.551
The stuff you're

14:01.591 --> 14:03.551
teaching me is stupid.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.803
Okay, that's it.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.680
You just lost these, pal.

14:06.721 --> 14:07.555
Oh, yeah? Well...

14:07.597 --> 14:08.556
(squealing)

14:08.598 --> 14:09.140
(screeching)

14:09.182 --> 14:09.974
(feedback)

14:10.016 --> 14:10.891
...you.

14:10.933 --> 14:14.020
You heard me.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.362
WOMAN (over television):

14:20.234 --> 14:22.362
Modeling isn't all glamour.

14:22.403 --> 14:26.115
Sometimes you have to act like

14:22.403 --> 14:26.115
it's hot when it's really cold.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.827
People don't realize

14:26.157 --> 14:28.827
how hard we work...

14:28.868 --> 14:34.290
I am the only one who truly

14:28.868 --> 14:34.290
understands you, Inga.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.710
I cannot believe

14:34.332 --> 14:36.710
you said that to Dad.

14:36.751 --> 14:37.918
Oh, and by the way--

14:37.960 --> 14:39.920
if you pass Francis

14:37.960 --> 14:39.920
on your way to Siberia,

14:39.962 --> 14:41.214
tell him I said hi.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.923
Do you think he told Mom?

14:42.965 --> 14:44.843
I wouldn't worry

14:42.965 --> 14:44.843
about that.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.511
Mom's feeling a lot better.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.638
Dr. Reese paid her

14:46.553 --> 14:48.638
a little visit.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.598
What are you talking about?

14:50.640 --> 14:54.935
Let's just say, pills

14:50.640 --> 14:54.935
and sandwich-- not effective;

14:54.977 --> 14:57.564
pills and milk-- effective.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.858
I just, I just

14:58.690 --> 14:59.858
don't get it.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.402
I mean, I have always been

14:59.899 --> 15:02.402
the good parent.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.028
(laughing)

15:04.070 --> 15:05.446
That's true.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.656
I'm the nice one.

15:06.698 --> 15:07.824
Yeah, that's true.

15:07.866 --> 15:08.825
You're the bad one.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.577
The system can't work

15:08.867 --> 15:10.577
with two bad cops.

15:10.618 --> 15:11.828
Oh, I hate cops.

15:11.870 --> 15:12.829
Cops, eh...

15:12.871 --> 15:13.872
You know what else

15:12.871 --> 15:13.872
I hate?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.749
Those what-do-you-

15:13.913 --> 15:15.749
call-thems? Those, uh...

15:15.790 --> 15:18.334
I just wasn't ready

15:15.790 --> 15:18.334
for this from Malcolm.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.334
...soap salesmen.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.960
Not yet. But he stepped

15:18.376 --> 15:19.960
over the line

15:20.002 --> 15:21.588
and I don't think

15:20.002 --> 15:21.588
there's any way back.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.547
I mean, it's not as if

15:22.589 --> 15:23.964
I caught him with a cigarette
