Why were we never in frats?

it wasn't for me

that it wasn't for me.

- He's alone in the house
with our friend right now.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.429
- Be careful, Stan's, like,
a real psych-bro-path.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.473
- Yeah, he's a, uh,
bro-ciopath.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.891
- That's funny, but--
- That was good.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.267
- Here he is.
- [on phone] Come home!

15:34.392 --> 15:35.685
He's gone completely crazy!
Oh, God!

15:35.810 --> 15:37.270
- We gotta go.
Come on, come on, come on!

15:37.395 --> 15:38.772
Come on, come on!

15:38.897 --> 15:40.148
- Oh, he's a--
He's a bro-mophobe!

15:40.273 --> 15:42.359
Bro-mophobe!
- Bro-mophobe.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.319
- Bro-mophobe.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.112
- Keeps going
to his voice-mail.

15:46.238 --> 15:47.864
Come on, Adam!
Pick up!

15:47.989 --> 15:50.408
- Oh, no, dude.
I'm pretty sure they're here.

15:50.534 --> 15:52.827
- Oh, no.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.124
Come on!

15:58.250 --> 16:00.460
- You don't know
what we're gonna see.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.128
Adam?
Adam?

16:02.254 --> 16:04.297
Jesus!
- Stan!

16:04.422 --> 16:05.840
If that's
even your real name.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.801
Or Steve!
Oh, I bet it's Steve.

16:07.926 --> 16:09.803
Or is it Michael?
You look like a Michael, man.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.388
And I'm gonna be pissed
if that's your name.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.056
- I'm right here.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.975
Sorry, I fell asleep
while standing.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.893
It's easy to do.
- Oh, no.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.645
- Oh, my God!
Are you okay, man?

16:18.770 --> 16:20.814
Oh, dip!
- Oh, dip.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.732
- "Oh, dip"?
Are we saying that now?

16:22.857 --> 16:25.026
- Yeah, some frat dude said it,
so we're gonna start using it.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.194
Oh!

16:26.319 --> 16:27.487
- Oh, I got--
I got hazed.

16:27.612 --> 16:28.863
Looks cool, huh?

16:28.989 --> 16:31.241
- Um...
Yeah! No, it's cool.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.742
- Yeah, sometimes
you gotta reinvent yourself.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.286
Miley Cyrus did it. Rihanna.
- No, shut up!

16:34.411 --> 16:35.870
Stop, Adam, stop!
Look, here's the deal.

16:35.996 --> 16:38.456
He was never in a frat.
Stan's lying to you.

16:38.582 --> 16:40.250
- What? - Yeah, here.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.751
- That doesn't seem real.
- It is real, trust me.

16:41.876 --> 16:45.297
- Dudes!
You came back!

16:45.422 --> 16:47.340
I made you dinner.

16:47.465 --> 16:48.842
Ahh!

16:48.967 --> 16:50.552
- Stan, it's great
to see you and all,

16:50.677 --> 16:51.886
but, uh,
we think you oughta go.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.972
We know you weren't
in Kappa...

16:54.097 --> 16:56.099
Zeta Nu.

16:56.224 --> 16:59.102
<i>_</i> Really?

16:59.227 --> 17:02.230
Well, if I wasn't
in Kappa Zeta Nu,

17:02.355 --> 17:05.358
would I do this?

17:06.693 --> 17:07.902

17:10.989 --> 17:12.406
Whoo!
- Cool!

17:12.531 --> 17:15.201
- [screaming]
Oh, it's come out perfect!

17:15.327 --> 17:17.746
[laughs]

17:17.871 --> 17:20.540
Wow, I might need one
of you bros to blow on this.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.250
[laughing]

17:22.375 --> 17:25.712
We are starting our own chapter
of Kappa Zeta Nu.

17:25.837 --> 17:28.423
And my main rule is,
once you're in,

17:28.548 --> 17:30.133
you're never getting out.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.927
- Okay, hey, you get that
hot iron thing away from us.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.429
- Ugh,
it smells like barbecue.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.014
Like a Memphis rub--
Aah!

17:36.139 --> 17:38.350
[all screaming]

17:38.475 --> 17:39.684
I'm the hero!
Did you see that?

17:39.809 --> 17:41.227
I'm a hero.

17:41.353 --> 17:43.730
Oh, shit.
Don't--don't run into this.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.316
- [screaming]
- Close the door!

17:46.441 --> 17:49.152
- [shrieking]

17:49.277 --> 17:51.196
- Time to become
fraternity brothers

17:51.321 --> 17:52.739
forever.

17:52.864 --> 17:55.241
But where's the most epic place
to brand you?

17:55.367 --> 17:57.535
The bicep?
Maybe the calf?

17:57.661 --> 17:59.079
- Drink while you think!

17:59.204 --> 18:00.580
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:00.705 --> 18:01.831
You're thinking about places
to brand us.

18:01.956 --> 18:02.999
That means
you gotta be drinking.

18:03.124 --> 18:04.167
That's your rule!
- Yeah.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.460
It's like a main one, right?

18:05.585 --> 18:09.422
- Fine, my buzz
is wearing off anyway.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.925
They're all empty, bro.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.426
We drank the house!

18:13.551 --> 18:14.844
- That means you need
to go on a beer run

18:14.969 --> 18:16.680
and leave us alone.
- Uh-uh.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.973
You can't leave pledges
unattended.

18:19.099 --> 18:22.310
I'll find something
to drink.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.979
- Hey! Hey!
This has alcohol in it.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.190
Just an air freshener thing.

18:27.315 --> 18:29.109
- I'm not drinking
that pussy piss.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.069
- Well, then you're breaking
one of your number one rules,

18:31.194 --> 18:32.862
you...peasant!

18:32.987 --> 18:34.280
- Peasant!
- Yeah.

18:34.406 --> 18:35.990
- Ooh.
- He's scared to drink it.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.535
- You're a scared
little bitch peasant.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.995
- Go fuck yourself,
San Diego!

18:41.121 --> 18:42.330
- Nice.
[laughing]

18:42.455 --> 18:43.540
Classic line.
- That was a good line.

18:43.665 --> 18:44.916
- It's so good!

18:45.041 --> 18:46.918
Once it hits your lips,
it's so good.

<i>Anchorman.

18:53.007 --> 18:54.259
- We might have killed him,
right?

18:54.384 --> 18:55.385
- I don't think so.
What are you--

18:55.510 --> 18:57.011
- [screams]
- Come on, hey.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.722
- Oh! Try it, try it.
- Do it again, do it again.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.014

We should cruise,

19:15.029 --> 19:17.240
pick up some rando sluts,
film it,

19:17.365 --> 19:19.200
call this the slam-bulance!

19:19.325 --> 19:20.744
- That's a great idea.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.036
- You sure you don't
wanna come with us?

19:22.162 --> 19:23.997

- Literally.

19:24.122 --> 19:26.583
- Okay, best of luck.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.627
- Sorry things got so weird
there at the end, Stan!

19:29.753 --> 19:31.963
- Yeah, and, uh, go back
to stalking those frat guys,

19:32.088 --> 19:33.798
dickhead!

19:33.923 --> 19:36.509
Oh, maybe we should
take that down.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.720
- Yeah, or...

19:38.845 --> 19:41.389
we could throw the most
legendary Kappa Zeta Nu party

19:41.514 --> 19:42.891
ever thrown.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.559
- I think that sounds...

19:44.684 --> 19:46.811
like an awesome idea,

19:46.936 --> 19:48.480
- Oh, no!
You're a pussy!

19:48.605 --> 19:50.398
- No, you're a pussy!
- You're both pussies.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.691
You're my pussies.

19:51.816 --> 19:54.110
We're out of beer.

19:54.235 --> 19:55.528
The party's tanking.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.572
- More importantly,
out of vodka and hummus.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.574
- [as Stan]
Don't worry.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.242
I got this.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.660
Okay, so we're out of beer!

20:02.786 --> 20:04.370
But it's cool,

20:04.496 --> 20:08.374
'cause this is now
a "take your titties out" party!

20:08.500 --> 20:10.084

20:10.210 --> 20:13.588
So, ladies, let's get
those blammos out and blam out!

20:13.713 --> 20:16.549
- Whoo!
- Blam on.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.551
Why isn't this working?
- This is not working.

20:18.676 --> 20:20.053
- Can I see your blams?
- They're leaving actually.

20:20.178 --> 20:21.346
- Can we?
- Yep, they're leaving.

20:21.471 --> 20:22.722
- I'd love to see
those blams.

20:22.847 --> 20:23.890
- This was better
when Stan was here.

20:24.015 --> 20:25.016

We can...
figure this out.

20:29.479 --> 20:31.773
- Okay, it's a--
it's a "no rules" party.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.566
- [snaps fingers]
No rules.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.527
- There's no booze, no rules.
There's no anything!

20:35.652 --> 20:36.986
- Okay, we're gonna go think.
You think.
