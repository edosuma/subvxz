WEBVTT

00:20.103 --> 00:20.938
Mom...

00:21.396 --> 00:23.106
I'm going to start over,

00:23.815 --> 00:26.485
and this time, I won't run away.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.617
Where is Ikuya Ogura?

00:33.825 --> 00:35.494
Tell him, Myers.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.080
Must be tough... being a lapdog.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.999
Nagai! What are you doing?

00:41.083 --> 00:42.542
I'm getting ready to move the hideout.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.336
We only have one chance to stop Sato,

00:44.419 --> 00:47.047
and that's a counterattack
when he moves on the minister.

00:47.422 --> 00:48.257
However,

00:49.758 --> 00:52.094
the only one who knows when is Mr. Tosaki.

00:52.302 --> 00:55.347
Change of plans. We're going
to go rescue Tosaki. Now.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.515
Intruders!

00:56.723 --> 01:00.644
I know you're worried about Mr. Tosaki,
but please do try to stay composed.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.062
I know.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.981
Mr. Tosaki! You're not getting away!

01:04.731 --> 01:07.067
I'm going to make sure
you're reprimanded for that.

01:07.276 --> 01:11.363
This is looking bad, Mr. Hirasawa.
They're heading for the U.S. Embassy.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.407
Embassies have extraterritorial rights.

01:13.615 --> 01:16.868
The police, the military,
nobody has any authority there.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.164
It means if they make it inside,
this is all over.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.825
Well then, shall we put on a show?

02:08.962 --> 02:10.881
<i>Close combat</i>
<i>I'm slashing</i>

02:11.298 --> 02:15.927
<i>You who are standing in front of me</i>
<i>Who are you?</i>

02:22.017 --> 02:23.185
AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN

02:23.268 --> 02:28.190
<i>Running away but not forever</i>
<i>Chewing and swallowing reality</i>

02:28.273 --> 02:32.235
<i>Shout it out</i>
<i>And refuse ambiguity</i>

02:32.736 --> 02:36.114
<i>Though you know the danger of the dark</i>

02:36.198 --> 02:39.034
<i>A type of system that is too cold</i>

02:39.117 --> 02:42.204
<i>On or off</i>
<i>Which one is it now?</i>

02:43.455 --> 02:47.626
<i>Ending up killing emotions</i>
<i>Over and over</i>

02:47.709 --> 02:53.090
<i>No, I was just slipping through</i>
<i>Being destroyed, that's all</i>

02:53.799 --> 02:56.426
<i>Leave me alone</i>
<i>Craze</i>

02:56.510 --> 03:00.180
<i>I am I</i>
<i>Even if I am cornered</i>

03:00.263 --> 03:01.515
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

03:01.598 --> 03:04.351
<i>Started with nothing but risk</i>
<i>From the beginning</i>

03:04.434 --> 03:06.937
<i>Give it all you got</i>
<i>Craze</i>

03:07.020 --> 03:12.025
<i>Reveal your true self, your instincts</i>
<i>Time to strike back</i>

03:12.109 --> 03:14.361
<i>Yeah</i>
<i>So I slashed</i>

03:14.444 --> 03:16.947
<i>Who are you?</i>

03:32.087 --> 03:35.424
KURO, JUST ONCE MORE, PLEASE!

03:38.760 --> 03:42.055
It'll take at least 10 minutes to get to
the embassy. We won't catch them.

03:42.139 --> 03:45.308
That's if you take the usual route!

03:48.854 --> 03:49.688
Go!

03:52.524 --> 03:57.529
No matter how I look at it, picking
a fight with the U.S. is irrational.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.417
Where's their car?!

04:10.625 --> 04:11.835
I don't see it.

04:15.630 --> 04:16.465
STOP

04:22.971 --> 04:25.640
All right, they took the street
I thought they would!

04:25.849 --> 04:26.933
Hold on.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.020
Ms. Shimomura, can you hear me?

04:30.228 --> 04:31.813
Yes, I hear you! Where are they?!

04:31.897 --> 04:33.982
<i>On a side street by the park</i>
<i>up ahead of you!</i>

04:47.829 --> 04:48.789
Turn around!

04:56.963 --> 04:57.881
Oh, no!

05:11.520 --> 05:12.354
Wha-- What are y--

05:15.148 --> 05:17.400
I'm resetting you. Damn it.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.820
I've come this far...

05:24.533 --> 05:26.952
We'll carry him the rest of the way!
Hurry up.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.675
Where's Mr. Tosaki?

05:42.259 --> 05:43.802
They got away!

05:43.885 --> 05:46.137
But they're still nearby!

05:48.390 --> 05:49.808
-Nakano!
-On it!

05:50.308 --> 05:52.644
There's heavy security near the embassy!

05:52.727 --> 05:54.938
Mr. Hirasawa,
you clean up after the accident!

05:57.732 --> 05:59.609
This way. Hurry up.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.530
Let go...

06:04.489 --> 06:05.323
Shut up!

06:29.431 --> 06:30.849
Where did--?

06:33.351 --> 06:38.148
<i>I don't have many bullets, and only</i>
<i>one tranq left. I can't afford to miss...</i>

06:41.985 --> 06:44.487
Don't let your guard down!
They've got an Ajin!

06:44.613 --> 06:45.739
I know that!

06:45.947 --> 06:48.325
Mr. Tosaki! Where are you?!

06:48.533 --> 06:50.327
Don't shout! Security will get us!

06:50.410 --> 06:52.203
I said, I know!

06:52.954 --> 06:54.039
Let's go.

06:55.206 --> 06:58.209
Once we get through here,
we're almost to the embassy.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.632
Do whatever it takes to stop her.

07:04.132 --> 07:04.966
Yes, sir.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.596
<i>That is futile!</i>

07:18.104 --> 07:19.230
I crushed your knee.

07:19.522 --> 07:22.192
You can't run, and you won't die.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.112
I hate women like you.

07:26.821 --> 07:29.532
You're basically just being kept
as a pet, you know.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.951
How stupid are you?

07:33.161 --> 07:35.705
You can't even summon
your IBM anymore.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.375
If you'd just run away like a good girl,

07:38.500 --> 07:40.877
you wouldn't have had
to suffer this unnecessary pain.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.881
You thought I wouldn't notice?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.425
Just how pathetic are you?

07:57.560 --> 08:01.147
I-- I decided...

08:03.692 --> 08:06.820
that I'm done... with running away!

08:07.529 --> 08:09.072
Wha--? The density, it's...!

08:09.280 --> 08:12.575
<i>Kuro, just once more, please!</i>

08:19.416 --> 08:21.710
This is a personal agreement
between me and you.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.087
Follow my orders.

08:25.922 --> 08:26.798
This is...

08:26.923 --> 08:28.216
Her memories...?!

08:33.722 --> 08:35.807
How useless are you?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.351
If you're gonna shoot, then shoot.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.354
I have no use for an Ajin
that can't do her job.

08:41.438 --> 08:46.151
It seems that lab rats
are best kept in cages.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.244
What? What are you--?

08:56.578 --> 09:00.248
You need to shut up right now.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.675
Don't misunderstand.

09:11.134 --> 09:14.471
I was only doing my job.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.307
Mr. Tosaki!

09:17.724 --> 09:20.018
Nagai! Over here!

09:21.978 --> 09:24.230
I don't have any way of stopping you now.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.858
But I've done my job.

09:29.736 --> 09:34.491
I really do hate women like you.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.545
Don't misunderstand.

09:48.213 --> 09:52.133
I'm just starting a new life.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.396
Ms. Izumi! Are you okay?!

10:08.316 --> 10:10.652
Mr. Tosaki! Mr. Tosaki!

10:14.405 --> 10:16.366
Wh-- Where am I...?

10:16.491 --> 10:18.118
We're on the way back to our hideout.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.121
Mr. Hirasawa and the others
are taking care of the aftermath.

10:21.204 --> 10:25.542
You should thank Ms. Izumi. Who knows
what would have happened without her?

10:25.667 --> 10:27.043
What...?

10:29.796 --> 10:32.757
The Minister! What about
the Minister's schedule?

10:34.300 --> 10:36.094
I thought you were
the only one who knew that.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.220
What...?

10:39.764 --> 10:41.432
So that's how it is.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.060
-What do you mean?
-When is it?

10:46.855 --> 10:49.691
It's not today, is it?

10:52.193 --> 10:54.028
What were you thinking?!

10:54.404 --> 10:57.824
Why didn't you tell Nagai?!
All our planning, for nothing!

10:58.366 --> 10:59.659
I'm sorry.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.787
Everything we did
was to prepare for this day!

11:03.121 --> 11:07.208
But... But you--!

11:11.045 --> 11:14.173
What's done is done, getting angry
about it is just a waste of time.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.843
-What we need to focus on now is--
-My phone!

11:16.926 --> 11:18.386
Where's my cell phone?!

11:18.469 --> 11:20.388
I held on to it for you.

11:24.559 --> 11:27.270
Please let there be an answer...

11:30.023 --> 11:32.650
This is Sokabe.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.658
How? How did the schedule get leaked?

11:41.367 --> 11:42.493
This way!

11:51.210 --> 11:52.712
Why is this happening?

11:52.921 --> 11:56.799
You took all that easy money.
You've got no right to complain now.

12:07.769 --> 12:08.686
Where is he?

12:08.811 --> 12:09.938
Not here either.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.564
Sir! Let's hurry!

12:20.615 --> 12:22.367
Get behind me!

12:24.869 --> 12:29.958
Hey, playing dead is pretty fun.

12:31.876 --> 12:35.755
Move, and you'll lose your head.

12:41.511 --> 12:42.720
Well done...

12:43.304 --> 12:46.557
I never thought you'd make it this far.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.643
I'm honored.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.771
Praise from the Minister himself!

12:53.314 --> 12:56.859
Your demands are the official release
of our experiment results

12:57.318 --> 12:59.779
and the recognition of Ajin rights,
right?

13:00.071 --> 13:01.364
So?

13:02.490 --> 13:03.950
I'll help you.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.203
I'm not all-powerful,
but I am a government minister.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.913
I'll counsel the Prime Minister!

13:09.330 --> 13:12.709
So, you'll acknowledge our demands?

13:12.917 --> 13:17.422
Yes! I can expose everything they've done.

13:17.505 --> 13:21.676
And eventually we may even come
to see Ajin gain their own territory.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.761
Mr. Sato...!

13:24.220 --> 13:27.557
You're a better politician than I thought.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.229
I'm just glad you understa--

13:39.152 --> 13:42.155
Thanks. That was quite the speech.

13:42.572 --> 13:43.948
Mr. Sato...

13:45.324 --> 13:48.161
-Why?
-Why what?

13:48.536 --> 13:51.914
I mean, he was going to help us...

13:52.248 --> 13:54.625
You're too naive, Tanaka.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.171
You do know a politician's job is to lie?

13:59.630 --> 14:00.673
But...

14:10.224 --> 14:12.477
Please, have mercy!

14:33.998 --> 14:37.043
This is Sokabe.

14:52.183 --> 14:54.560
Why's everyone acting so depressed?

14:54.852 --> 14:57.939
With Mr. Tosaki back, we still
have a chance to stop Sa--

14:58.022 --> 14:58.856
No.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.276
The Minister was the only chance we had,
and he's dead.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.028
We're out of moves.

15:04.112 --> 15:04.946
But...!

15:05.571 --> 15:07.740
If you've got complaints,
take them up with her.

15:12.370 --> 15:13.454
It's done.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.374
What's done...?

15:16.457 --> 15:18.167
Cleaning up the aftermath.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.670
We couldn't just leave it like that.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.673
Sorry. That was more
than you're paid for.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.635
I don't mind that, but we're not sure
where the Ajin woman went.

15:28.136 --> 15:30.304
She won't cause us any trouble.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.349
I'm sure no one will find her now.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.769
Are you just covering for her
because she's an Ajin?

15:36.853 --> 15:37.854
That's not it...

15:37.937 --> 15:41.983
Just try that again sometime.
I'll send you straight to the lab.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.901
Mr. Tosaki! That's going too--

15:44.110 --> 15:47.613
More importantly, where's Nagai?
I don't see him here.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.449
He's still dealing with loose ends.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.160
He's sending fake e-mails
to the Department of Defense

15:52.243 --> 15:54.829
from a laptop we got from their car.

15:55.163 --> 15:58.583
Apparently he's going to report
that the incident with Dr. Ogura

15:58.749 --> 16:01.586
as well as the attack on the safe house,
was all Sato's doing.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.760
You're telling them
that Sato kidnapped me?

16:09.969 --> 16:13.848
If we do, then the Americans
might go after Sato as well.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.309
They might stop him for us.

16:16.517 --> 16:23.107
And then you'll let those two
go "missing" after that final mail, eh?

16:24.692 --> 16:27.403
You certainly are a crafty little devil.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.658
I'll take that as a compliment.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.664
You don't need that "has" there.

16:38.748 --> 16:39.624
What?

16:40.249 --> 16:41.250
But...

16:41.417 --> 16:45.379
It's grammatically correct, but they don't
really use it like that over there.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.965
You'd ace an exam, though.

16:48.591 --> 16:49.550
I'm sure.

16:50.259 --> 16:54.263
But if no one will let you take the test,
there's no point.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.642
What are you planning to do after this?

16:57.975 --> 17:00.520
There's still got to be a way.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.773
There was just an unexpected distraction.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.900
It's not as though the plan
actually fail--

17:08.069 --> 17:11.697
MESSAGE FROM SATO
A NEW VIDEO HAS BEEN UPLOADED

17:14.659 --> 17:16.327
We move out of here in the morning.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.496
We're ready to go anyway.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.498
Move out? Where?

17:20.581 --> 17:22.667
How should I know?
Figure it out for yourself.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.169
Are you serious?!

17:25.378 --> 17:29.632
Now that the minister's dead,
I'll be removed from the Commission.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.218
You're not the only one
with nowhere to go.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.515
It looks like there's still hope.

17:38.808 --> 17:43.104
Sato's uploaded another announcement.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.572
<i>Did you see that?</i>

17:53.114 --> 17:56.075
<i>That corpse was once the Minister</i>
<i>of Health, Labor, and Welfare.</i>

17:56.617 --> 17:59.495
<i>It probably hasn't made the news yet.</i>

18:00.496 --> 18:02.164
<i>There's one final target.</i>

18:02.415 --> 18:05.001
<i>President Hashiguchi</i>
<i>of Musashi Heavy Industries.</i>

18:06.043 --> 18:09.589
<i>Three days from now when the board</i>
<i>of directors meeting is held, at 7 p.m.,</i>

18:10.423 --> 18:12.008
<i>I'm going to kill you.</i>

18:12.758 --> 18:14.760
He's giving us the date and time?!

18:14.969 --> 18:19.932
Mr. Sato loves to fight and play games.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.646
<i>This is a declaration of war.</i>

18:26.731 --> 18:28.649
<i>If the President doesn't show up,</i>

18:28.816 --> 18:33.571
<i>I'll take that as his admission that he's</i>
<i>conducting inhumane experiments on Ajin.</i>

18:33.988 --> 18:38.659
<i>And no matter where he's hiding,</i>
<i>I will kill him.</i>

18:39.827 --> 18:41.871
He's gotta be kidding...

18:41.954 --> 18:45.041
This'll only make security way tougher.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.460
You didn't say anything, Okuyama?!

18:47.918 --> 18:50.880
It's not my job to come up with the plans.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.716
So I don't butt in.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.843
Hey, Mr. Tanaka! What about you?

18:58.429 --> 19:00.097
Is there a problem?

19:01.891 --> 19:02.892
No.

19:03.559 --> 19:08.648
Mr. Sato, why did you
put us at a disadvantage?

19:09.357 --> 19:10.608
Disadvantage?

19:10.900 --> 19:13.152
No, if anything, it's an advantage.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.528
What?

19:14.737 --> 19:16.864
Don't you think this is just
the type of situation

19:17.406 --> 19:19.617
where we can put our secret weapon to use?

19:31.962 --> 19:33.547
<i>We're here at the press conference.</i>

19:33.631 --> 19:38.552
<i>This is a joint conference with the</i>
<i>government and Musashi Heavy Industries,</i>

19:38.636 --> 19:40.262
<i>the target of Sato's threat.</i>

19:43.974 --> 19:47.978
<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>we will not give in to terrorists.</i>

19:48.312 --> 19:52.692
And no matter how I am threatened,
I will not run or hide.

19:52.775 --> 19:56.070
So you're really holding a meeting
of the board of directors?

19:56.153 --> 19:58.948
-What will you do if something happens?
-Is this safe?

19:59.031 --> 20:02.702
Naturally, I intend to have
the best possible security,

20:02.785 --> 20:06.163
and have already made a request
to the government.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.040
That is all.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.126
Hold on a second!

20:10.334 --> 20:13.462
Next we will hear an explanation
from the Chief Cabinet Secretary.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.718
I am Chief Cabinet Secretary Mitsui.

20:18.801 --> 20:21.011
In response to these repeated acts
of terrorism,

20:21.095 --> 20:23.764
at this meeting
the government has made plans

20:23.848 --> 20:27.435
to take special measures
against certain Ajin.

20:27.643 --> 20:31.689
And along with these measures, the various
ministries have come together

20:31.897 --> 20:34.400
to form a new defense unit.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.068
It shall be called

20:37.069 --> 20:39.196
<i>the "Anti-Ajin Special Forces."</i>

20:39.572 --> 20:40.573
ANTI-AJIN SPECIAL FORCES

20:41.365 --> 20:42.575
What, the Anti-Ajin...?!

20:42.658 --> 20:44.618
Anti-Ajin? What are they?

20:45.161 --> 20:47.788
They're an elite force
specializing in fighting Ajin.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.666
The members were hand-picked

20:50.750 --> 20:53.419
from the Defense Force
First Airborne Brigade and the SAT.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.714
You sure seem to know a lot
about this newly formed unit...

20:58.215 --> 21:00.384
Oh, I get it.

21:01.969 --> 21:02.845
What?

21:03.387 --> 21:04.555
What do you get?

21:05.222 --> 21:08.976
A special unit like that couldn't
have been put together in under two days.

21:09.268 --> 21:15.816
So it must have already existed,
but couldn't act officially. Am I right?

21:16.025 --> 21:17.026
Yes.

21:17.651 --> 21:20.988
Until now,
they shouldn't legally have existed.

21:21.071 --> 21:25.284
But claiming they were created
as part of these new measures

21:25.576 --> 21:28.871
makes their existence legal, huh?

21:29.830 --> 21:31.248
Not bad.

21:31.457 --> 21:36.629
This country is the best in the world
at managing appearances.

21:36.962 --> 21:40.966
So? Are these Anti-Ajin guys
tough or something?

21:41.175 --> 21:46.180
They're equipped with all the latest
and most inhumane weaponry

21:46.263 --> 21:48.432
made by Musashi Industries.

21:48.766 --> 21:53.604
And they'll be used by the strongest unit
Japan is currently capable of mustering.

21:54.522 --> 21:57.817
There may be no need for us after all.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.360
That would certainly be nice.

21:59.527 --> 22:05.032
As long as someone can stop Sato,
that's the most important thing.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.035
Do you really believe that?

22:09.829 --> 22:11.372
Of course not.

22:12.581 --> 22:16.126
I have no intention of just watching
and sitting on my hands.

22:16.418 --> 22:20.214
What do you think I joined forces
with you for in the first place?

22:21.841 --> 22:24.718
Yeah, that's right.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.096
This is our last chance.

22:27.596 --> 22:31.058
No matter what, we'll stop Sato.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.063
TO BE CONTINUED

22:37.481 --> 22:40.526
<i>I'm tired of this one already, so</i>

22:40.609 --> 22:43.862
<i>I'll trade it</i>

22:43.946 --> 22:49.118
<i>For your ordinary one</i>

22:50.286 --> 22:56.542
<i>A shiny holy card</i>

22:56.667 --> 23:02.256
<i>For a grainy paper card</i>

23:03.007 --> 23:07.136
<i>You can see them all</i>

23:09.430 --> 23:13.851
<i>When you come to my house</i>

23:13.934 --> 23:19.982
<i>So</i>
<i>Two of us in the corner of the schoolyard</i>

23:20.065 --> 23:22.192
<i>While the wind blows</i>

23:22.276 --> 23:26.530
<i>I might be able to say it now</i>

23:28.657 --> 23:34.913
<i>Words I've never said to anyone</i>

23:34.997 --> 23:41.295
<i>"Won't you come and play, I'll be nice"</i>

23:41.378 --> 23:47.259
<i>"I'll give you anything, see"</i>

23:47.843 --> 23:50.554
<i>"Be my friend</i>

23:50.638 --> 23:57.436
<i>Always"</i>
