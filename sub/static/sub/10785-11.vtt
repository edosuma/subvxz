11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
THE MOST OBVIOUS
BEING PACEY AND ANDIE.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.333
PACEY'S SEXUALLY
EXPERIENCED,
AS WE ALL KNOW,

11:17.333 --> 11:20.417
AND ANDIE'S FALLEN
HEAD OVER HEELS
IN LOVE WITH HIM.

11:20.417 --> 11:21.166
INSANITY RUNS
IN HER FAMILY.

11:21.166 --> 11:22.959
TRUE.

11:23.750 --> 11:27.291
THEN THERE'S JOEY AND JACK.

11:27.291 --> 11:29.458
THEY SHARE THAT WHOLE
ARTISTIC VIBE.

11:29.458 --> 11:31.500
YOU KNOW, PROGRESSIVE,
UNINHIBITED,

11:31.500 --> 11:33.333
EXPERIMENTAL.

11:33.333 --> 11:35.667
AND JOEY'S GOT HER
HOT LITTLE ANGLE.

11:36.583 --> 11:39.750
THEN THERE'S
DAWSON AND JEN.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.333
HE'S ON THE REBOUND,

11:41.333 --> 11:43.959
AND GOD KNOWS
SHE LIKES TO BOUNCE.

11:43.959 --> 11:45.750
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

11:45.750 --> 11:47.000
DO YOU LIKE
TO BOUNCE?

11:47.000 --> 11:50.208
CHRIS, YOUR LINES
LAND LIKE BRICKS.

11:50.208 --> 11:53.250
LOOK, I'M GOING TO NEED
YOUR HELP ON THIS.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.041
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO DOCUMENT THIS THING,

11:55.041 --> 11:56.208
ON VIDEO.

11:56.208 --> 11:57.417
WHY?
OUT OF THE GOODNESS
OF MY HEART?

11:57.417 --> 12:00.625
FORGET ABOUT IT.

12:00.625 --> 12:04.041
I'LL LET YOU TOUCH ME
IN BAD PLACES.

12:04.041 --> 12:05.041
OK.

12:18.542 --> 12:19.417
HEY.

12:19.417 --> 12:22.500
HEY, DAWSON.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.375
LOOKS LIKE
SCARY WEATHER.

12:24.375 --> 12:25.750
YEAH. I HEARD IT'S
SUPPOSED TO RAIN

12:25.750 --> 12:27.750
FOR THE NEXT
COUPLE DAYS.

12:27.750 --> 12:29.417
SO WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

12:29.417 --> 12:31.959
OH, THIS? DRAWING
FOR ART CLASS.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.417
THE NAKED MAN?

12:33.417 --> 12:35.125
YEAH.

12:35.125 --> 12:36.333
HOW'D IT TURN OUT?

12:36.333 --> 12:39.041
NAKED.

12:40.041 --> 12:40.083
CAN I SEE IT?

12:42.959 --> 12:46.375
UM, HOW'S THE MOVIE
COMING, DAWSON?

12:46.375 --> 12:47.583
GOOD.

12:47.583 --> 12:50.834
WE, UM--STILL CASTING.

12:50.834 --> 12:53.000
WE CAN'T SEEM TO FIND
A LEADING LADY.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.917
WHY IS THAT?

12:54.917 --> 12:55.583
WELL, IT--

12:55.583 --> 12:57.542
IT'S DIFFICULT.

12:57.542 --> 13:00.166
THE PART REQUIRES
A CERTAIN MIXTURE

13:00.166 --> 13:02.417
OF SPIRITED PASSION
WITH WIDE-EYED INNOCENCE

13:02.417 --> 13:05.583
AND UNPARALLELED
EXTERNAL BEAUTY.

13:05.583 --> 13:06.583
HA. SO...

13:06.583 --> 13:08.250
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE LOOKING

13:08.250 --> 13:10.333
FOR A JULIA ROBERTS, DAWSON.

13:10.333 --> 13:12.333
WHAT I NEED IS A YOU.

13:22.959 --> 13:25.667
DAWSON, IS THIS
THE MOVIE ABOUT US?

13:27.000 --> 13:30.125
IT'S A DRAMA
IN THE VEIN OF US.

13:33.083 --> 13:34.625
WELL,

13:34.625 --> 13:36.291
I SHOULD READ IT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

13:36.291 --> 13:38.000
I MEAN,

13:38.000 --> 13:39.875
MAKE SURE IT'S
NOT A CHARACTER
ASSASSINATION.

13:39.875 --> 13:41.458
JOEY, I WOULD
NEVER WRITE

13:41.458 --> 13:43.417
ANYTHING HURTFUL
ABOUT YOU, EVER.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.375
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT.

13:48.291 --> 13:51.041
YEAH.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.583
[RAIN STOPS]

13:55.583 --> 13:57.166
WELL...

13:57.166 --> 13:59.125
LOOKS LIKE I SHOULD PROBABLY
MAKE A BREAK FOR IT.

13:59.125 --> 14:01.875
UM, THANKS FOR WAITING OUT
THE RAIN WITH ME.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.291
ANYTIME.
OK.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.834
Abby: SO YOU READ
DAWSON'S REWRITE?

14:15.834 --> 14:17.291
WE HAVE SEX.

14:17.291 --> 14:18.250
IT'S DISGUSTING.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.792
YEAH. SO WHEN DO YOU
WANT TO PRACTICE?

14:20.792 --> 14:23.041
CHRIS,
I HAVE A FINGER

14:23.041 --> 14:24.208
I PLACE IN MY MOUTH
FOR VOMITING.

14:24.208 --> 14:27.125
MY POINT WAS THAT THIS
IS THE CLOSEST THING

14:27.125 --> 14:29.166
WE HAVE TO A CLUE
IN OUR LITTLE
WHO-SCREWED-IT.

14:29.166 --> 14:30.166
NOW I'M GOING
TO NEED YOUR HELP

14:30.166 --> 14:31.959
WITH SOME NECESSARY
QUESTIONING.

14:31.959 --> 14:34.041
WHAT, YOU'RE JUST
GOING TO ASK THESE
GUYS IF THEY HAD SEX?

14:34.041 --> 14:36.291
NO. YOU CAN'T
ASK THEM DIRECTLY.

14:36.291 --> 14:37.834
YOU JUST HAVE
TO SHAKE THE TREE
A LITTLE BIT.

14:37.834 --> 14:38.834
SEE WHAT FALLS OUT.

14:38.834 --> 14:40.041
Jen: HEY,
YOU GUYS.

14:40.041 --> 14:41.208
WATCH.

14:41.208 --> 14:42.875
LISTEN, I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO PUT TOGETHER

14:42.875 --> 14:44.834
A REHEARSAL SCHEDULE
FOR THE FILM,

14:44.834 --> 14:46.750
UM, AND SO, I'M GOING
TO NEED YOU
TO FILL THESE OUT

14:46.750 --> 14:48.542
WITH YOUR AVAILABILITIES
FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS

14:48.542 --> 14:50.875
AND GET THEM BACK TO ME
ASAP, ALL RIGHT?

14:50.875 --> 14:51.875
SO, JEN,

14:51.875 --> 14:53.000
I JUST HAD
THE PLEASURE

14:53.000 --> 14:54.250
OF READING
DAWSON'S REWRITES,

14:54.250 --> 14:55.959
AND I NOTICED
SOME SIGNIFICANT
ALTERATIONS.

14:55.959 --> 14:58.583
NAMELY,
ONE OF THE KINKIEST
SEX SCENES

14:58.583 --> 15:00.500
SINCE MICKEY ROURKE
CRACKED OPEN
THE REFRIGERATOR

15:00.500 --> 15:01.542
IN 9 1/2 WEEKS.

15:01.542 --> 15:02.458
ALL RIGHT, ABBY,
BEFORE YOU GO THERE--

15:02.458 --> 15:04.208
NO, I'M ALREADY
THERE, JEN.

15:04.208 --> 15:05.667
YOU SEE, SINCE
DAWSON'S MOVIE

15:05.667 --> 15:07.375
IS MAINLY
AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL,

15:07.375 --> 15:08.417
I WAS WONDERING IF
SOME OF MY NEW SCENES

15:08.417 --> 15:10.959
WERE ACTED OUT
BEFORE THEY WERE
WRITTEN.

15:10.959 --> 15:13.208
IT REALLY DOESN'T
TAKE TOO MUCH TO SHIFT

15:13.208 --> 15:15.125
YOUR HYPERCREATIVE MIND
INTO OVERDRIVE, DOES IT?

15:15.125 --> 15:18.333
OH, NO, THIS
ISN'T JUST BASED
ON ASSUMPTION.

15:18.333 --> 15:19.750
PEOPLE DO
HEAR THINGS,

15:19.750 --> 15:21.083
LIKE ABOUT
THE OTHER NIGHT.

15:21.083 --> 15:23.417
WHAT ABOUT IT?
YOU TELL ME.

15:23.417 --> 15:25.250
DOES DAWSON LEERY
HAVE ANY OTHER
TALENTS

15:25.250 --> 15:26.417
BESIDES FILMMAKING?

15:27.917 --> 15:29.583
ABBY, WHAT HAPPENS
IN MY BEDROOM

15:29.583 --> 15:30.667
IS MY BUSINESS,
ALL RIGHT?

15:30.667 --> 15:32.750
OOH. THE BEDROOM.

15:32.750 --> 15:34.583
IS THAT WHERE
THE CRITICAL EVENTS
UNFOLDED?

15:34.583 --> 15:36.583
I DIDN'T SAY THAT--

15:36.583 --> 15:38.000
YOU DIDN'T
REFUTE IT EITHER.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.667
JEN, IT'S WRITTEN
ALL OVER

15:39.667 --> 15:40.875
YOUR POSTCOITAL
GLOWING FACE.

15:40.875 --> 15:43.708
YOU FINALLY WOOED
THE WONDER-BOY

15:43.708 --> 15:45.250
INTO THE DARK SIDE.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.375
SO, WAS IT WORTH
ALL THE PINING?

15:46.375 --> 15:49.750
ALL THE FEELING
THAT YOU WEREN'T
GOOD ENOUGH?

15:49.750 --> 15:52.166
YEAH. IT WAS.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.083
MY GOD,
YOU DID IT.

15:57.083 --> 15:59.166
YOU GOT HER
TO BREAK.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.708
A SEXUAL CONFESSION
FROM JEN LINDLEY?
PLEASE.

16:00.708 --> 16:02.959
THAT'S LIKE BILL GATES

16:02.959 --> 16:04.000
ADMITTING THAT
HE MADE $2.00 LAST YEAR.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.333
NO. OUR WORK
IS FAR FROM OVER.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.125
WE STILL HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHOSE HANDWRITING

16:09.125 --> 16:10.166
WAS ON THAT LETTER.

16:12.166 --> 16:13.708
WHAT'S THIS?

16:13.708 --> 16:15.208
I KNOW YOU
CAN READ, PACEY.

16:15.208 --> 16:15.708
IT'S A PETITION.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.625
FOR WHAT?

16:17.625 --> 16:18.959
A SCHOOL
CONDOM DISPENSER.

16:18.959 --> 16:20.625
I'M COLLECTING
SIGNATURES.

16:20.625 --> 16:21.458
YOU'RE TOO MUCH, ABBY.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.125
TEENAGERS
THESE DAYS,

16:23.125 --> 16:23.708
WE'RE JUST
GROWING UP SO FAST.

16:23.708 --> 16:26.041
SEX IS EVERYWHERE.

16:26.041 --> 16:27.583
YOU KNOW, LIKE
WITH YOU AND ANDIE.

16:27.583 --> 16:28.542
HEY, TELL ME, ABBY,
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE

16:28.542 --> 16:30.500
TO MAKE YOU
A DISTANT MEMORY?

16:30.500 --> 16:32.792
LOOK,
ALL I'M ASKING FOR
IS A SIGNATURE.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.250
A LITTLE
JOHN HANCOCK
AND I'LL BE GONE.

16:34.250 --> 16:36.166
THE ONLY THING
I SUPPORT OF YOURS
IS YOUR EXECUTION.

16:36.166 --> 16:37.542
CAREFUL, JACK,
SOME MIGHT TAKE
THAT CAUSTIC EDGE

16:37.542 --> 16:40.458
AS A BY-PRODUCT
OF SERIOUS SEXUAL
REPRESSION.

16:40.458 --> 16:43.959
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
HAVE YOU HAD SEX
WITH JOEY?

16:43.959 --> 16:45.291
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

16:45.291 --> 16:46.834
Chris: AND SINCE SO MUCH
OF YOUR LIFE

16:46.834 --> 16:48.000
SEEMS TO BE INVESTED
IN THIS ROLE,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.291
I JUST THOUGHT
I'D PICK YOUR
BRAIN A LITTLE.

16:50.708 --> 16:52.417
SHOOT.

16:52.417 --> 16:54.583
WELL, THE SEX SCENE,
FOR INSTANCE,

16:54.583 --> 16:56.125
CLEARLY IT'S RIPPED
FROM LIFE EXPERIENCE.

16:58.166 --> 16:59.375
YOUR POINT?

16:59.375 --> 17:01.291
WELL, I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT IT WAS LIKE,

17:01.291 --> 17:02.041
YOUR FIRST TIME.

17:02.041 --> 17:03.333
I MEAN,
IT'S BEEN SO LONG

17:03.333 --> 17:05.916
SINCE MY OWN FIRST VENTURE
IN THE JUNGLES OF LOVE,

17:05.916 --> 17:07.125
I JUST THOUGHT I'D ASK
A NEWCOMER.

17:07.125 --> 17:09.290
WAIT, YOU THINK
THAT I HAD SEX
WITH JEN?

17:09.290 --> 17:10.541
SO YOU DIDN'T
HAVE SEX WITH HER?

17:10.541 --> 17:12.333
YES.
YOU DID?

17:12.333 --> 17:14.333
YES. NO. NO.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.875
YES, I DID NOT
HAVE SEX WITH JOEY.

17:16.875 --> 17:19.458
LOOK, GO AWAY.
YOU'RE DEMENTED.

17:19.458 --> 17:21.625
Chris: HEY, I'M JUST
GOING BY WHAT I HEAR.

17:24.208 --> 17:26.375
AND WHO'S THE SOURCE
THIS TIME?

17:26.375 --> 17:28.959
WELL, IF YOU AND JEN
WERE THE ONLY TWO

17:28.959 --> 17:29.792
IN HER ROOM,

17:29.792 --> 17:33.208
WHO DO YOU THINK IT IS?

17:33.208 --> 17:35.333
Abby: SIGN IT
FOR ALL WOMANHOOD.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.583
MOST GIRLS DON'T HAVE
THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE

17:36.583 --> 17:39.417
WHEN IT COMES
TO PROTECTING
THEMSELVES.

17:39.417 --> 17:40.750
MY KNOWLEDGE?

17:40.750 --> 17:41.750
YOU CAN PLAY
THE WHOLE

17:41.750 --> 17:43.500
DEMURE INGENUE
FROM RHODE ISLAND

17:43.500 --> 17:44.542
WITH ANOTHER
AUDIENCE,

17:44.542 --> 17:46.000
BECAUSE I KNOW
EVERYTHING.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.250
YOU DO?
YEAH.

17:47.250 --> 17:49.375
LIKE ABOUT
THE OTHER NIGHT.

17:49.375 --> 17:52.041
IT'S THE PROPERTY
OF GOSSIP
TRANSFERENCE.

17:52.041 --> 17:53.625
PACEY BRAGS
TO DAWSON,

17:53.625 --> 17:56.291
DAWSON TELLS JEN,
JEN TELLS ME,

17:56.291 --> 17:57.583
I TELL THE WORLD.

17:57.583 --> 17:58.875
YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES.

17:58.875 --> 17:59.875
AND THE CURRENT
PIECE OF GOSSIP

17:59.875 --> 18:01.917
REVOLVES AROUND
PACEY AND ME?

18:01.917 --> 18:03.250
ANDIE, I REALLY
DON'T WANT TO BE
THE ONE

18:03.250 --> 18:04.792
IMPARTING TO YOU
THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND
SAYS YOU'RE LACKING.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.000
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

18:06.000 --> 18:08.083
THAT ALL
HIS EXPERIENCE

18:08.083 --> 18:09.291
IS WITH
A 40-YEAR-OLD
TEACHER.

18:09.291 --> 18:10.500
WHAT DOES HE
EXPECT FROM YOU?

18:11.875 --> 18:12.959
Chris: IT'S
A GOOD READ.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.333
RECENTLY HE DID
SOME HEAVY-DUTY
REVISIONS.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.792
PUT A LITTLE
NOOKY IN...

18:19.667 --> 18:21.792
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE AWAY
THE ENDING.

18:23.667 --> 18:24.750
CHRIS, I SHOULD WAIT
UNTIL HE ASKS.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.333
I TELL YOU WHAT,

18:26.333 --> 18:29.208
I'LL JUST SLIP IT
IN YOUR BAG RIGHT HERE,

18:29.208 --> 18:31.041
AND, UH,

18:31.041 --> 18:32.959
YOU MAKE THE CALL.

18:35.708 --> 18:37.625
WHATEVER.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.500
OH, AND, JOEY...

18:40.667 --> 18:42.333
JUST, UH, REMEMBER
TO KEEP IT ON THE Q.T.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.792
[SIGHS] WHO DO
I HAVE TO SLEEP WITH

18:52.792 --> 18:55.125
TO SOLVE THIS
MYSTERY?

18:55.125 --> 18:57.250
WELL, I CAN THINK
OF ONE OPTION.

18:57.250 --> 18:58.875
YEAH, RIGHT.

18:59.750 --> 19:00.959
HMM.

19:00.959 --> 19:01.792
LOOKS LIKE
MISS POTTER

19:01.792 --> 19:02.375
LEFT SOMETHING
BEHIND.

19:06.125 --> 19:07.458
AND THE PLOT
THICKENS.

19:26.125 --> 19:27.125
ABBY.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.208
[SIGHS] YOU SHOULD
REALLY WORK

19:29.208 --> 19:32.208
ON MAKING THOSE GREETINGS
MORE PERSONABLE, DAWSON.

19:32.208 --> 19:34.375
LOOK, ABBY,
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO,

19:34.375 --> 19:35.667
BUT I'M NOT
IN THE MOOD.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.125
THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEAR.

19:37.125 --> 19:38.500
REALLY?

19:38.500 --> 19:40.875
WELL, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE IMPLYING,

19:40.875 --> 19:43.166
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
DESPITE ANY AND ALL
RUMORS,

19:43.166 --> 19:45.250
JEN AND I DID NOT
HAVE SEX.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.458
OHH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

19:47.458 --> 19:48.959
WE'RE BOTH FINE
WITH IT ACTUALLY.

19:48.959 --> 19:50.834
NO, I MEANT FOR JOEY.

19:50.834 --> 19:52.542
SHE MUST BE FEELING
LIKE CRAP RIGHT NOW.

19:52.542 --> 19:54.291
I MEAN, HERE SHE WENT
AND SLEPT WITH JACK

19:54.291 --> 19:55.667
AND THE ONLY THING
PROTECTING HER

19:55.667 --> 19:57.083
FROM THE OODLES OF GUILT
THAT ONE AMASSES

19:57.083 --> 19:58.583
POST SUCH A CRITICAL EVENT

19:58.583 --> 20:00.917
WAS THE SLIGHT CHANCE
THAT YOU AND JEN
BUMPED UGLIES.

20:00.917 --> 20:02.125
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING

20:02.125 --> 20:03.875
WITH THIS
CONVERSATION,
BUT I'M ENDING IT.

20:03.875 --> 20:04.917
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:04.917 --> 20:07.041
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:07.041 --> 20:08.375
I SHOULD JUST
GIVE YOU THIS
AND GO.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.208
THIS MEANS NOTHING.

20:17.208 --> 20:19.333
EXCEPT THE OBVIOUS.

20:19.333 --> 20:20.375
TELL ME,

20:20.375 --> 20:22.750
HAS JOEY EVER
DRAWN YOU NAKED?

20:22.750 --> 20:24.208
OUT.

20:24.208 --> 20:26.500
JACK McPHEE
DRAWN NAKED.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.500
DAWSON LEERY DRAWN
OUT OF THE PICTURE.

20:28.500 --> 20:30.834
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
YOU WEREN'T JOEY'S FIRST,

20:30.834 --> 20:33.208
AND YOU'RE CERTAINLY
NOT GOING TO BE
HER LAST,

20:33.208 --> 20:35.625
SO I GUESS
THAT MAKES YOU HER...

20:37.250 --> 20:38.917
NOTHING.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.542
Mr. Peterson on Intercom:
THE CAPESIDE HIGH
ANNUAL BOOK FAIR

20:46.542 --> 20:49.208
IS NOW COMMENCING
IN THE CAFETERIA.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.583
EXPAND YOUR HORIZONS

20:50.583 --> 20:52.542
AND READ A BOOK TODAY,

20:52.542 --> 20:54.500
BECAUSE THERE'S
MORE TO LIFE

20:54.500 --> 20:57.500
THAN "MUST SEE TV."

20:57.500 --> 20:59.125
Abby: LIKE WE DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH TO READ
FOR SCHOOL.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.375
THEY WANT US TO START
READING FOR PLEASURE?

21:01.375 --> 21:03.083
DON'T YOU
LOOK EDIBLE TODAY.

21:03.083 --> 21:04.583
HANDS OFF.
I DON'T WANT TO CATCH

21:04.583 --> 21:06.041
ANY OF YOUR DISEASES.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.834
SO WHODUNIT?

21:09.834 --> 21:11.583
I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK
THEY ALL DID.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.875
WE'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH.

21:13.875 --> 21:16.250
THE DENOUEMENT
IS RAPIDLY APPROACHING.

21:16.250 --> 21:18.917
THE DENOUEMENT
IS FOR REVEALING
ANSWERS, ABBY.

21:18.917 --> 21:20.375
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY.

21:20.375 --> 21:22.250
YOU UNDERESTIMATE ME.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.750
YOU HEARD DAWSON.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.375
THE SECRET
TO SOLVING A MYSTERY

21:25.375 --> 21:26.375
IS GAUGING
HUMAN BEHAVIOR.

21:26.375 --> 21:29.458
IF I MAKE THEM THINK
I KNOW THE ANSWERS,

21:29.458 --> 21:32.291
THE ANSWERS WILL BE
FORTHCOMING.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.125
MAKE SURE THESE GET
INTO THE RIGHT HANDS

21:35.125 --> 21:36.917
AND BE DISCREET ABOUT IT.

21:36.917 --> 21:39.375
YOU KNOW
WHO YOU ARE?

21:39.375 --> 21:41.458
YOU'RE NANCY DREW

21:41.458 --> 21:43.166
FROM HELL.

21:43.166 --> 21:44.708
AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT.

21:51.291 --> 21:53.542
Pacey: HEY, McPHEE,
YOU GOT A SECOND?

21:53.542 --> 21:54.625
I'M BUSY.

21:54.625 --> 21:56.125
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

21:56.125 --> 21:57.166
OH, REALLY?

21:57.166 --> 21:57.959
APPARENTLY YOU'VE BEEN
DOING ENOUGH TALKING

21:57.959 --> 22:00.250
FOR BOTH OF US.

22:00.250 --> 22:01.375
EXCUSE ME?

22:01.375 --> 22:02.792
YOU KNOW,
IT'S INTERESTING

22:02.792 --> 22:05.667
THAT I GET
THE COLD, SHUT-DOWN,

22:05.667 --> 22:06.667
NON-VERBAL PACEY,

22:06.667 --> 22:08.834
BUT THE REST
OF CAPESIDE
GETS A TASTE

22:08.834 --> 22:10.834
OF THE RETURN
OF PACEY WITTER,

22:10.834 --> 22:13.125
UNDERACHIEVING
TOWN LOTHARIO.

22:13.125 --> 22:14.250
HA HA.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.667
LISTEN, I KNOW YOU'RE
PROBABLY FREAKED OUT

22:15.667 --> 22:16.667
ABOUT MY WEIRDNESS
YESTERDAY,

22:16.667 --> 22:17.875
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY
WHY I CAME IN HERE

22:17.875 --> 22:20.250
TO TALK TO YOU,
BUT YOU'RE KIND
OF LOSING ME

22:20.250 --> 22:21.500
ON EVERYTHING ELSE.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.834
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN
SAYING TO PEOPLE
ABOUT US, PACEY?

22:23.834 --> 22:25.166
ABOUT US? NOTHING.

22:25.166 --> 22:28.125
WELL, THAT'S NOT
WHAT ABBY MORGAN
SAYS.

22:29.834 --> 22:30.834
COME ON, ANDIE.
SINCE WHEN DO YOU LISTEN

22:30.834 --> 22:32.625
TO WHAT ABBY MORGAN
HAS TO SAY?

22:32.625 --> 22:34.208
SHE KNOWS.

22:34.208 --> 22:35.667
ABOUT?

22:39.625 --> 22:40.667
THE OTHER NIGHT.

22:41.875 --> 22:44.333
WELL,

22:44.333 --> 22:46.000
ANDIE,
WHAT'S TO KNOW?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.708
YOU AND I SHARED

22:47.708 --> 22:50.667
A WONDERFUL
ROMANTIC EVENING.

22:50.667 --> 22:52.458
AND IF YOU WEREN'T
HAPPY WITH ME,

22:52.458 --> 22:54.250
OR WITH WHAT HAPPENED
THE OTHER NIGHT,

22:54.250 --> 22:55.917
THEN YOU SHOULD
MAKE IT CLEAR

22:55.917 --> 22:57.750
INSTEAD OF SPREADING
ALL THIS SEXUAL PROPAGANDA

22:57.750 --> 22:58.834
ALL OVER SCHOOL.

22:58.834 --> 22:59.792
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

22:59.792 --> 23:01.000
THE OTHER NIGHT,
IT WAS PERSONAL.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.375
AND THE FACT
THAT THERE'S SOME
WARPED REVISIONIST

23:04.375 --> 23:06.041
VERSION OF IT
WAFTING ALL OVER
THE HALLWAYS

23:06.041 --> 23:08.500
MAKES ME THINK
THAT SOMEONE'S
BEEN TALKING.

23:08.500 --> 23:10.166
AND IT MAKES ME
REALLY NOT WANT

23:10.166 --> 23:11.542
TO TALK TO YOU
RIGHT NOW.

23:11.542 --> 23:13.542
OK. IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU THINK,

23:13.542 --> 23:14.667
I GUESS WE REALLY
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.959
[SIGHS]

23:46.792 --> 23:48.000
HEY.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.583
HEY.

23:53.625 --> 23:55.834
SO THAT'S DAWSON'S
SCRIPT, HUH?

23:57.667 --> 23:58.792
YEAH.

23:58.792 --> 24:00.417
SO, DID YOU
READ IT YET?

24:00.417 --> 24:01.250
I FLIPPED THROUGH IT.

24:01.250 --> 24:03.333
SO, WHAT'D YOU THINK?

24:03.333 --> 24:06.583
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A ONE-SIDED VIEW

24:06.583 --> 24:08.417
OF A STORY THAT
WOULD BE BETTER
LEFT UNTOLD.

24:08.417 --> 24:11.041
I TAKE IT
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE

24:11.041 --> 24:12.417
THE WAY
YOU'RE DEPICTED.

24:12.417 --> 24:14.333
THAT, AND I'M JUST
WONDERING

24:14.333 --> 24:15.792
WHAT OTHER ELEMENTS
OF THE SCRIPT

24:15.792 --> 24:18.417
ARE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL.

24:18.417 --> 24:20.291
WELL, MAYBE
YOU SHOULD TALK

24:20.291 --> 24:22.083
TO THE WRITER
ABOUT THAT.

24:36.875 --> 24:38.625
HAVE YOU SEEN JOEY?

24:41.375 --> 24:43.417
SHE'S
AT THE BOOK FAIR.

24:43.417 --> 24:44.417
OK, WELL,
SINCE YOU TWO

24:44.417 --> 24:46.708
SEEM SO CLOSE
THESE DAYS,

24:46.708 --> 24:47.917
YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE HER
BEFORE I WILL.

24:49.417 --> 24:50.500
DOES YOUR ANIMOSITY
HAVE A POINT HERE,
DAWSON,

24:50.500 --> 24:52.625
OR IS THIS JUST
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY

24:52.625 --> 24:53.667
FOR YOU TO HARASS ME

24:53.667 --> 24:54.375
OVER A DECAYING ISSUE?

24:54.375 --> 24:55.750
JUST GIVE HER THIS FOR ME.

24:58.083 --> 24:59.208
TELL HER I WAS...

24:59.208 --> 25:01.208
OVERWHELMED

25:01.208 --> 25:03.166
BY HER TALENT.

25:03.166 --> 25:06.333
SO WAS I.

25:23.875 --> 25:25.875
HELLO.

25:25.875 --> 25:27.959
JACK.

25:27.959 --> 25:29.041
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

25:29.041 --> 25:30.834
I GOT THIS INSCRUTABLE
INVITATION

25:30.834 --> 25:32.000
TAPED TO MY LOCKER.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.375
IT SAYS, "YOUR PRESENCE
IS REQUESTED

25:33.375 --> 25:35.959
"IN MR. PETERSON'S ROOM
AT 7 P.M.

25:35.959 --> 25:36.667
"I HAVE SOMETHING
VERY VALUABLE

25:36.667 --> 25:38.458
THAT MAY BELONG
TO YOU."

25:38.458 --> 25:40.250
YEAH, I GOT
THE EXACT SAME
INVITATION.

25:40.250 --> 25:42.166
[SIGHS]

25:42.959 --> 25:44.166
ANDIE?

25:44.166 --> 25:45.000
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

25:45.000 --> 25:47.333
UH--

25:47.333 --> 25:48.542
Pacey: HEY.

25:48.542 --> 25:51.000
I SEE YOU GUYS
ALL GOT THE MYSTERIOUS
SUMMONS, TOO.

25:52.208 --> 25:53.208
SO WHAT'S GOING DOWN?

25:53.208 --> 25:55.000
IS THIS SOME LAME
PRACTICAL JOKE, OR WHAT?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.250
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

25:57.875 --> 25:58.708
[SIGHS] YOU KNOW,

25:58.708 --> 26:00.750
I HAVE THIS HORRIBLE FEELING

26:00.750 --> 26:02.166
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO'S
BEHIND ALL OF THIS.

26:02.166 --> 26:05.291
WHO?

26:05.291 --> 26:07.000
TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:07.000 --> 26:11.917
OH, LOOK. ALL OF MY FAVORITE
PEOPLE GATHERED IN ONE ROOM,

26:11.917 --> 26:12.417
AND I FORGOT MY CAMERA.

26:12.417 --> 26:14.000
SHOULDA KNOWN.

26:15.125 --> 26:17.208
OHH! OH, NO, I DIDN'T.

26:17.208 --> 26:18.667
ALL RIGHT, ABBY.

26:18.667 --> 26:21.708
WHAT SORT OF DEVIOUS
SCHEME HAVE YOU HATCHED
UP THIS TIME, HUH?

26:21.708 --> 26:23.250
ALL GOOD THINGS COME
TO THOSE WHO WAIT,

26:23.250 --> 26:27.083
BUT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN VERY
GOOD AT POSTPONING PLEASURE,
HAVE YOU, JEN?

26:27.083 --> 26:29.417
Pacey: WHY DID YOU
BRING US HERE, ABBY?

26:29.417 --> 26:31.166
TO TAKE PART
IN ONE OF YOUR
SATANIC RITUALS?

26:31.166 --> 26:32.750
ACTUALLY,
MY MYSTERY PROJECT.

26:32.750 --> 26:36.083
IN MY POSSESSION,
I HAVE A LETTER,

26:36.083 --> 26:39.291
A LOST LETTER THAT
WAS WRITTEN BY ONE
OF YOU IN THIS ROOM

26:39.291 --> 26:40.708
TO ANOTHER ONE OF YOU
IN THIS ROOM.

26:40.708 --> 26:43.959
STOP ME IF YOU'VE
HEARD THIS BEFORE.

26:43.959 --> 26:45.750
[UNFOLDS LETTER]

26:45.750 --> 26:48.041
"I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

26:48.041 --> 26:51.750
"IT ALWAYS COMES OUT
WRONG, SO I THOUGHT
I'D WRITE IT DOWN.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.417
"THE WHOLE NIGHT
WAS AMAZING,

26:53.417 --> 26:55.375
"BUT HAVING SEX
CHANGES EVERYTHING,

26:55.375 --> 26:57.875
AND I THINK WE SHOULD
TAKE SOME TIME BEFORE
ANYTHING HAPPENS AGAIN."

26:57.875 --> 27:00.083
THIS IS ABSURD.
I AM SO OUT OF HERE.

27:00.083 --> 27:02.000
OH, COME ON, JOEY.
DON'T YOU WANT TO
STICK AROUND

27:02.000 --> 27:04.542
AND SEE WHO THE AUTHOR
OF THIS LETTER IS?

27:12.000 --> 27:12.834
SEX...

27:12.834 --> 27:15.708
THE WORLD'S
GREATEST MYSTERY.

27:15.708 --> 27:19.875
PHILOSOPHERS, POETS,
SCIENTISTS OVER TIME

27:19.875 --> 27:21.542
HAVE TRIED TO
RATIONALIZE IT,

27:21.542 --> 27:23.875
EXPLAIN IT, GLORIFY IT,
CRIMINALIZE IT--

27:23.875 --> 27:25.375
CAN YOU SPARE US
THE MONOLOGUE?

27:25.375 --> 27:27.166
CAN YOU JUST GET
TO THE POINT, ABBY?

27:27.166 --> 27:29.291
WHO WROTE THE LETTER?

27:29.291 --> 27:30.875
WHO WROTE THE LETTER?

27:32.041 --> 27:34.250
THAT'S ALL YOU
CARE ABOUT, ISN'T IT?

27:34.250 --> 27:35.458
FINE.

27:36.792 --> 27:37.834
WHEN THE LETTER WAS FIRST
BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION,

27:37.834 --> 27:42.041
MY GUT INSTINCT
SAID DAWSON AND JEN.

27:42.041 --> 27:44.667
SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO
SEDUCE HIM FOR WEEKS.

27:44.667 --> 27:47.458
AND NOW WITH
ALL THEIR LATE-NIGHT
WORKING SESSIONS

27:47.458 --> 27:51.500
AND HIM RELIVING HIS
PUNY AFFAIR WITH JOEY
THROUGH HIS WRITING,

27:51.500 --> 27:55.000
I THOUGHT MAYBE, IN
THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT,

27:55.000 --> 27:56.667
HE NEEDED
A JOEY REPLACEMENT.

27:56.667 --> 28:00.500
BUT THEN I THOUGHT--
DAWSON? NO WAY.

28:00.500 --> 28:07.208
HE'S SAVING HIMSELF
FOR JOEY...OR OLD AGE,
WHICHEVER COMES FIRST.

28:07.208 --> 28:09.917
AND JEN? SHE HAS WAY
TOO MANY INTIMACY ISSUES

28:09.917 --> 28:12.834
TO ACTUALLY BUMP SOMEBODY
SHE CARES ABOUT.

28:12.834 --> 28:17.542
SO MY NEXT GUESS
WAS JACK AND JOEY.

28:17.542 --> 28:19.500
JOEY'S THE LIBERATED
WOMAN THESE DAYS,

28:19.500 --> 28:21.625
AND UNDERNEATH

28:21.625 --> 28:24.750
JACK'S SENSITIVE
LITTLE-BOY-LOST FACADE,

28:24.750 --> 28:28.333
I HAVE A FEELING
THERE'S A SEX PIG
JUST WAITING TO JUMP OUT.

28:28.333 --> 28:32.125
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE
READY TO GRADUATE
TO A REAL WOMAN.

28:32.125 --> 28:34.250
PUH! YOU'RE SICK
AND SO WRONG.

28:34.250 --> 28:35.708
IS SHE?

28:36.750 --> 28:38.750
WE'VE ALL SEEN THE PICTURE.

28:38.750 --> 28:39.959
Joey: WHAT?

28:39.959 --> 28:40.917
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT, DAWSON.

28:40.917 --> 28:43.542
THAT PICTURE
WAS FOR ART CLASS.

28:43.542 --> 28:46.166
HUH. WHAT
HAPPENED AFTER THE
MODELING SESSION?

28:46.166 --> 28:47.208
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

28:47.208 --> 28:48.625
MAYBE I DON'T.
Abby: HERE WE GO.

28:48.625 --> 28:50.041
GET THIS, CHRIS.
Joey: OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

28:50.041 --> 28:51.708
YOU'RE TOO BUSY
REWRITING YOUR SCRIPT
TO IMITATE LIFE.

28:51.708 --> 28:53.417
I KNOW ALL
ABOUT YOU AND JEN.

28:53.417 --> 28:54.750
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

28:54.750 --> 28:55.959
HOW SAD.
ROMANTIC DESTINY

28:55.959 --> 28:58.250
FULFILLED
WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE.

28:58.250 --> 28:59.208
ABBY, YOU HAVE IT
ALL WRONG.

28:59.208 --> 29:00.708
OH, SO YOU DIDN'T
HAVE SEX WITH JEN?

29:04.208 --> 29:06.375
Joey: WELL, ANSWER
THE QUESTION, DAWSON.

29:06.375 --> 29:07.417
I MEAN, TELL THE TRUTH.

29:07.417 --> 29:09.250
OK, THE TRUTH IS,
YOU SLEPT WITH JACK.

29:09.250 --> 29:11.125
WELL, MAYBE I DID.
MAYBE I SLEPT WITH JEN.

29:11.125 --> 29:12.083
THIS IS GOOD.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.500
YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?
DID YOU?

29:13.500 --> 29:15.083
MAYBE.
JUST TRY TO TELL
THE TRUTH, JOEY.

29:15.083 --> 29:16.083
NO! YOU TELL THE TRUTH.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.250
I ASKED YOU
A QUESTION FIRST!

29:17.250 --> 29:18.250
I ASKED YOU A--

29:18.250 --> 29:19.125
YES!
YES!

29:26.375 --> 29:28.875
THAT'S NOT THE TRUTH.

29:32.583 --> 29:34.834
WE DID NOT
SLEEP TOGETHER.

29:36.417 --> 29:39.250
I COULDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT,
AND NEITHER COULD HE.

29:39.250 --> 29:42.208
IT WASN'T RIGHT,
AND THIS PATHETIC
LITTLE DISPLAY HERE

29:42.208 --> 29:44.000
MAKES IT ALL
THE MORE OBVIOUS WHY.

29:53.834 --> 29:56.125
WE DIDN'T EITHER.

29:56.125 --> 29:58.959
SO YOUR
LITTLE ASSUMPTION,
DAWSON, WAS WRONG.

30:01.208 --> 30:03.083
WE COULDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

30:04.667 --> 30:10.583
SO THIS LITTLE MOVIE LIFE
THAT YOU'RE LIVING, DAWSON,
IS NOT IN DANGER.

30:13.041 --> 30:17.041
Abby: OH, THEN WE ONLY
HAVE ONE COUPLE LEFT.

30:17.041 --> 30:18.500
"SEX CHANGES EVERYTHING.

30:18.500 --> 30:22.250
I THINK WE SHOULD
TAKE SOME TIME BEFORE
ANYTHING HAPPENS AGAIN."

30:22.250 --> 30:25.000
SO...

30:25.000 --> 30:26.625
THIS ONLY LEAVES ANDIE.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.125
I DIDN'T WRITE THAT.

30:28.125 --> 30:29.333
OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.125
I CHECKED THE HANDWRITING.

30:31.125 --> 30:33.333
IT BELONGS TO PACEY.

30:36.375 --> 30:37.000
YOU WROTE THAT?

30:39.875 --> 30:43.041
WELL, DID YOU, PACEY?

30:45.625 --> 30:47.708
WHY?

30:52.333 --> 30:55.792
OK, SO THAT'S WHY YOU'VE
BEEN SO WEIRD LATELY,

30:55.792 --> 30:58.291
AND WHY YOU'VE
BEEN SO COLD.

31:00.166 --> 31:02.625
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY, PACEY?

31:06.166 --> 31:11.291
SO YOU SLEEP WITH ME,
AND YOU DON'T WANT ME?

31:14.417 --> 31:16.125
YOU DISGUST ME.

31:27.250 --> 31:29.625
THAT'S NOT HOW IT IS.

31:33.417 --> 31:34.917
DID YOU GET THAT?

31:38.500 --> 31:43.375
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU
COME FROM, OR JUST WHO
HAS THE MISFORTUNE

31:43.375 --> 31:45.375
OF BEING RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR EXISTENCE,

31:45.375 --> 31:49.333
BUT YOU ARE A LYING,
MANIPULATIVE,
AND CRUEL PERSON,

31:49.333 --> 31:51.917
AND THE FACT THAT YOU
ARE ONLY 16 YEARS OLD

31:51.917 --> 31:55.375
MAKES ME FEEL MORE SORRY
FOR YOU THAN ANY OF
THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM

31:55.375 --> 31:58.000
WHOSE LIVES YOU'RE
SO INTENT ON DESTROYING.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.166
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

32:11.917 --> 32:13.667
AND BECAUSE
OF HER WELL-DRAWN,

32:13.667 --> 32:16.750
RECURRING SLEUTHS
AND CLEVER MYSTERIES,
AGATHA CHRISTIE WILL REIGN

32:16.750 --> 32:20.708
AS THE PREMIER WOMAN
MYSTERY WRITER OF THE PAST,
PRESENT, AND FUTURE.

32:20.708 --> 32:21.917
THANK YOU.

32:21.917 --> 32:23.458
VERY GOOD, JOSEPHINE.

32:23.458 --> 32:24.667
THANKS.

32:24.667 --> 32:26.458
NOW...

32:26.458 --> 32:29.792
ABIGAIL.

32:29.792 --> 32:31.834
YOU'RE UP.

32:36.083 --> 32:38.875
IS IT POSSIBLE,
MISS MORGAN,

32:38.875 --> 32:41.583
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO
SURPRISE ME WITH
YOUR ASSIGNMENT?

32:41.583 --> 32:44.208
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
YOU FINALLY DECIDED

32:44.208 --> 32:45.583
TO DO SOMETHING GOOD
FOR YOURSELF

32:45.583 --> 32:48.792
AND APPLY
A LITTLE INTEGRITY
TO YOUR EDUCATION?

33:03.291 --> 33:07.875
I WOULDN'T WANT TO
DISAPPOINT YOU, MR. PETERSON.

33:07.875 --> 33:09.417
I DIDN'T DO IT.

33:09.417 --> 33:12.959
AND INTEGRITY,
JUST FOR THE RECORD,

33:12.959 --> 33:17.667
IS A TIRED NOTION, LAST SEEN
IN THE LATE SEVENTIES.

33:17.667 --> 33:21.208
THEN I'M SURE A LACK
OF INTEGRITY

33:21.208 --> 33:25.417
WILL MAKE IT EASIER
TO ACCEPT YOUR "F."

33:26.667 --> 33:28.500
JUST FOR THE RECORD.

33:29.625 --> 33:32.041
AND WHO IS NEXT?

33:32.041 --> 33:33.333
MS. McPHEE?

33:41.250 --> 33:42.667
THANK YOU.

33:42.667 --> 33:44.250
WHATEVER.

33:55.375 --> 33:58.041
HEY.

33:58.041 --> 33:59.667
HEY.

33:59.667 --> 34:01.875
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
SCHOOL'S OVER.
GO HOME.

34:01.875 --> 34:03.333
AHH, JUST, UM, THINKIN'.

34:03.333 --> 34:05.750
AHEM.

34:05.750 --> 34:07.041
ABOUT WHAT?

34:07.041 --> 34:11.542
THAT IT'S NOT THAT MUCH FUN
PLAYIN' SECOND STRING.

34:11.542 --> 34:13.667
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN,

34:13.667 --> 34:14.708
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

34:14.708 --> 34:17.333
I HAVE.

34:17.708 --> 34:20.333
UH...

34:20.333 --> 34:21.458
HERE.

34:26.000 --> 34:26.667
HAVE A SEAT.

34:26.667 --> 34:29.458
OK.

34:29.458 --> 34:34.083
SO, UM, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT, UM...

34:34.083 --> 34:35.458
DAWSON?

34:35.458 --> 34:38.125
WELL, I GUESS THERE'S
REALLY NOTHING I CAN DO.

34:38.125 --> 34:41.917
I MEAN, AS MUCH
AS I LOVE THE GUY,

34:41.917 --> 34:44.333
HE'S JUST NOT THERE YET.

34:44.333 --> 34:48.458
AND I CAN TAKE ALL
THE JERKS IN THE WORLD

34:48.458 --> 34:51.041
CLIMBING IN AND OUT
OF MY BEDROOM WINDOW,

34:51.041 --> 34:55.833
BUT WHEN
DAWSON LEERY DOES IT,
IT BETTER BE FOR ME.

34:55.833 --> 35:01.125
THAT IS SO COOL
HOW YOU CAN JUST
UNLEASH ALL THAT

35:01.125 --> 35:02.667
ONTO SOMEBODY
YOU BARELY KNOW.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.000
OR JUST CRAZY.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.083
NO. I MEAN,
I WISH THAT I COULD
BE MORE OPEN LIKE THAT.

35:07.083 --> 35:10.208
WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE IT A SHOT?

35:10.208 --> 35:12.500
WHY DIDN'T YOU
AND JOEY DO IT?

35:12.500 --> 35:13.667
HA!

35:13.667 --> 35:14.834
I CAN'T--

35:14.834 --> 35:17.083
I CAN'T, UH, I CAN'T SAY.

35:17.083 --> 35:20.959
COME ON. YOU CAN THINK
OF IT AS GROWTH.

35:20.959 --> 35:21.917
COME ON. YOU'VE GOT
TO TELL ME. SHOOT.

35:21.917 --> 35:24.917
UH-UH. HEH HEH HEH.

35:24.917 --> 35:27.083
OH, COME ON. I JUST
SPILLED MY GUTS TO YOU.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.625
GO FOR IT.

35:28.625 --> 35:31.667
ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU PROMISE
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING
TO ANYONE?

35:31.667 --> 35:33.500
I SWEAR.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.625
ALL RIGHT. 'CAUSE THIS,
YOU KNOW, IT'S--

35:35.625 --> 35:36.583
IT'S REALLY EMBARRASSING.

35:39.458 --> 35:41.041
OK.

35:41.041 --> 35:42.250
ALL RIGHT.

35:44.291 --> 35:46.250
[WHISPERING]

35:46.250 --> 35:47.583
OH, YOU COULDN'T
GET YOUR--

35:47.583 --> 35:48.083
SHH!

35:48.083 --> 35:48.875
YOU PROMISED.

35:48.875 --> 35:51.208
NO. I KNOW. I KNOW.

35:53.792 --> 35:55.959
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

35:55.959 --> 35:59.500
I, UH, I CAN'T--
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR JOEY,

35:59.500 --> 36:03.125
BUT I REALLY WANTED TO
REALLY BADLY...

36:03.125 --> 36:07.291
AND IT JUST
WOULDN'T COOPERATE.

36:07.291 --> 36:10.333
I COULDN'T EVEN
TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF,
I WAS SO SCARED.

36:10.333 --> 36:12.625
MAYBE I HAVE A PROBLEM.
I DON'T KNOW.

36:12.625 --> 36:14.500
NO. HEY, IT'S OK.

36:14.500 --> 36:18.208
ALL RIGHT, BELIEVE ME.
I'VE BEEN THERE.

36:20.750 --> 36:23.125
OH, YEAH. YEAH. THOSE...

36:23.125 --> 36:25.875
THINGS JUST
NEVER COOPERATE.

36:25.875 --> 36:27.041
HA HA HA.

36:27.041 --> 36:28.208
HA HA HA.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.667
GET OUT.

36:43.667 --> 36:45.041
WE'RE NOT DONE.

36:45.041 --> 36:47.041
OH, YES, WE ARE.

36:47.041 --> 36:49.458
ANDIE, I KNOW THAT
MY BEHAVIOR OF LATE

36:49.458 --> 36:50.917
HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT
CONFUSING,

36:50.917 --> 36:55.208
AND I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR BEING SO COLD
AND SO DISTANT,

36:55.208 --> 36:58.542
BUT A LOT OF STUFF
HAS BEEN HAPPENING AND...

36:58.542 --> 37:01.083
WELL, I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN
REALLY KNOW WHERE TO START.

37:01.083 --> 37:03.417
YOU CAN START BY
GETTING OUT OF THE CAR.

37:03.417 --> 37:07.041
WHY DON'T I TRY STARTING
AT THE TRUTH?

37:17.792 --> 37:19.500
MY HISTORY QUIZ.

37:19.500 --> 37:22.250
I NEVER TOLD
YOU MY GRADE.

37:24.458 --> 37:24.917
PACEY...

37:24.917 --> 37:26.834
YOU GOT A--

37:26.834 --> 37:28.125
AN "A."

37:28.125 --> 37:30.041
I GOT AN "A."

37:30.041 --> 37:33.708
THAT'S THE FIRST "A"
I'VE EVER GOTTEN
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE,

37:33.708 --> 37:35.291
AND IT KINDA THREW ME
FOR A LOOP.

37:35.291 --> 37:38.291
WHY? YOU WORKED
SO HARD FOR IT.

37:38.291 --> 37:40.041
BECAUSE IT
CHANGES EVERYTHING.

37:40.041 --> 37:42.917
I MEAN, DON'T YOU SEE?

37:42.917 --> 37:44.750
EVERYTHING'S ALWAYS BEEN
SO PREDICTABLE FOR ME,

37:44.750 --> 37:47.750
BUT NOW, MY WHOLE LIFE
COURSE IS CHANGING,

37:47.750 --> 37:50.959
AND EVER SINCE YOU
AND I HAD SEX,

37:50.959 --> 37:53.417
I FELT ANXIOUS...

37:53.417 --> 37:55.708
YOU KNOW?

37:55.708 --> 37:56.875
WONDERING...

37:56.875 --> 37:59.000
SHOULD WE HAVE WAITED?
SHOULD WE HAVE SLOWED DOWN,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.875
QUESTIONING
WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO,

38:01.875 --> 38:06.250
WISHING THAT I
HAD TAKEN THE HIGH ROAD,
AND THAT'S NOT ME.

38:06.250 --> 38:08.417
IT USED TO BE THAT
THE ONLY COMFORTING PART
ABOUT BEING PACEY

38:08.417 --> 38:10.583
WAS THAT I ALWAYS KNEW
WHAT TO EXPECT,

38:10.583 --> 38:15.959
AND NOW I DON'T HAVE A CLUE,
AND I'M TERRIFIED.

38:15.959 --> 38:19.125
AND THAT'S WHY I WAS
PULLING AWAY FROM YOU.

38:21.792 --> 38:24.375
IT'S OK TO BE
SCARED, PACEY.

38:24.375 --> 38:28.458
I MEAN, THE WORLD
IS A SCARY, SCARY PLACE.

38:28.458 --> 38:30.959
PACEY, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE SCARED OF ME.

38:30.959 --> 38:32.291
HOW CAN I NOT BE, ANDIE?

38:32.291 --> 38:35.041
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S OPENING UP
THIS WHOLE LIFE FOR ME.

38:35.041 --> 38:38.875
I'M JUST--
I'M AFRAID THAT--AHH...

38:38.875 --> 38:41.375
WHAT?

38:43.542 --> 38:46.458
I AM AFRAID
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE SINGLE
MOST IMPORTANT BEING

38:46.458 --> 38:48.792
TO EVER GRACE MY EXISTENCE.

38:48.792 --> 38:51.625
ANDIE, I...

38:51.625 --> 38:54.750
I AM FALLING HOPELESSLY
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

39:01.542 --> 39:03.458
SAY SOMETHING.

39:03.458 --> 39:07.750
'CAUSE I DID
JUST KINDA CUT IT OPEN
AND LAY IT OUT FOR YA.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.250
YEAH. HEH...

39:10.250 --> 39:12.959
THAT WAS PRETTY SCARY.

39:14.333 --> 39:16.834
THAT'S IT? THAT'S ALL
YOU HAVE TO SAY?

39:17.917 --> 39:21.333
NO.

39:21.333 --> 39:23.208
I'LL SAY THAT...

39:23.208 --> 39:25.000
I SHARE YOUR FEAR.

39:27.750 --> 39:28.625
YEAH?

39:30.083 --> 39:33.208
YOUR EXACT FEAR.

40:18.083 --> 40:21.959
YOU AND I CRY SEX UNTIL
WE'RE BLUE IN THE FACE,

40:21.959 --> 40:23.667
AND THEN WHEN IT COMES DOWN
TO ACTUALLY DOING IT,

40:23.667 --> 40:27.417
ALL WE'RE LEFT WITH
ARE A COUPLE
OF HARMLESS KISSES.

40:27.417 --> 40:29.208
I MEAN,
THE SETTING WAS RIGHT,
THE TIMING WAS PERFECT,

40:29.208 --> 40:32.250
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED.

40:32.250 --> 40:32.625
WHY?

40:36.208 --> 40:38.083
I KNOW WHY.

40:38.083 --> 40:40.125
YOU DO?

40:40.125 --> 40:42.583
YEAH.
SAME REASON NOTHING
HAPPENED WITH ME.

40:44.917 --> 40:46.542
DAWSON...

40:46.542 --> 40:51.458
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE PERFECT SETTING,

40:51.458 --> 40:54.708
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE PERFECT TIMING.

40:54.708 --> 40:55.875
UM...

40:57.917 --> 41:00.041
IT'S ABOUT
THE PERFECT PERSON.

41:28.917 --> 41:31.291
HEY.

41:41.125 --> 41:43.959
WHY DID YOU WANT ME
TO THINK THAT YOU SLEPT
WITH JACK?

41:51.750 --> 41:53.458
I DON'T KNOW.

41:53.458 --> 41:59.166
I GUESS THE SAME REASON
YOU WANTED ME TO THINK
YOU SLEPT WITH JEN.

42:02.834 --> 42:04.667
THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER.

42:06.166 --> 42:10.208
WELL, THAT'S
THE ONLY ANSWER YOU'RE
GONNA GET, I GUESS.

42:14.333 --> 42:16.458
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T.

42:22.708 --> 42:25.542
I'M GLAD
YOU DIDN'T EITHER.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.708
JOEY, I MISS YOU.

42:31.375 --> 42:32.917
I MISS YOU, TOO.

42:32.917 --> 42:36.208
I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN
RECAPTURE 15 YEARS
OF WHAT WE HAD,

42:36.208 --> 42:39.917
BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY
BE WILLING TO ACCEPT
ANY SMALL FRACTION

42:39.917 --> 42:41.458
YOU WANT TO SEND MY WAY.

42:45.792 --> 42:47.792
WELL, MAYBE WE--

42:47.792 --> 42:49.667
WE CAN START SLOWLY.

42:51.917 --> 42:53.166
OK. YEAH.

42:53.166 --> 42:56.208
OK.

43:02.333 --> 43:04.125
OK.

43:05.625 --> 43:07.917
AHH.

43:07.917 --> 43:12.250
WELL, IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE THIS RAIN IS GONNA
LET UP ANY TIME SOON, SO...

43:12.250 --> 43:15.750
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE MAKE A RUN FOR IT?

43:15.750 --> 43:18.667
UH-UH.

43:20.166 --> 43:21.708
I SAY WE WALK.

43:21.708 --> 43:23.291
COME ON.

43:25.250 --> 43:28.041
AH...WHOO!

43:29.458 --> 43:33.417
SO, WHAT DID YOU REALLY
THINK OF MY SCRIPT?

43:33.417 --> 43:36.708
WANT THE WHOLE, HONEST,
BITTER, CYNICAL TRUTH?

43:36.708 --> 43:37.708
YEAH.

43:40.000 --> 43:44.250
WELL, I HAD NO IDEA
I WAS SO  MYSTERIOUS.

43:44.250 --> 43:46.125
YOU ARE DEFINITELY
A MYSTERY.

43:47.583 --> 43:50.708
I LIKE THE WAY
YOU SEE ME.
