<i> [narrator] Previously</i>
<i>  on Queen Sugar.</i>

00:01.469 --> 00:02.835
I have a friend.

00:02.837 --> 00:06.705
Something has come up
in the friendship,
it's intimacy.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.440
I don't think
I can marry you.

00:08.442 --> 00:11.043
I'm a patient man.
I'm not going anywhere.

00:11.045 --> 00:13.879
I'd like as much love
surrounding this baby
as possible.

00:13.881 --> 00:15.681
I got an extra room.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.850
I can help you with the baby
if you need it.

00:17.852 --> 00:21.787
That cemetery you mentioned
being registered
as a historical site.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.922
Can we do something like that
with our land?

00:23.924 --> 00:24.790
Ideas for a co-op.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.925
If we put our money together,

00:26.927 --> 00:29.428
maybe we could get us
some control and some power.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.001
All right.

00:36.003 --> 00:38.170
You got everything you need?

00:38.172 --> 00:40.072
I think so.

00:40.074 --> 00:43.108
If not, I'll make do.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.177
I'll get it done.

00:46.747 --> 00:47.846
All right.

00:47.848 --> 00:52.251
Um, food, sandwiches,
snacks, coffee.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.986
Babe, we shouldn't take
too long.

00:53.988 --> 00:55.454
Okay.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.955
I ain't got no time to waste.

00:56.957 --> 00:59.858
You do what you gotta do,

00:59.860 --> 01:01.427
but you come home.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.062
I always do.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.906
I love you.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.307
I love you back.

01:18.012 --> 01:19.978
You do what you gotta do.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.680
Images from the university's
spectral thermal camera
looked into the ground

01:54.682 --> 01:57.716
around Blue's Corner
on our land, thereby,

01:57.718 --> 02:00.886
Dominic found more images
of remains, more bones.

02:00.888 --> 02:05.057
It's astonishing to me
that these go back to 1887,

02:05.059 --> 02:06.959
makes you wonder
about the circumstances.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.760
-Hmm.
-I shudder to think?

02:08.762 --> 02:10.362
We think we know
whose they are.

02:11.065 --> 02:12.564
Thibodaux Massacre.

02:12.566 --> 02:15.000
It's one of the bloodiest days
in US labor history.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.802
It all went down right here
in Louisiana,

02:16.804 --> 02:19.705
when 60
Black sugarcane workers
were murdered

02:19.707 --> 02:21.840
just because they tried
to join a union.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.775
Wanting better for themselves
and their families.

02:23.777 --> 02:24.943
That's right.

02:24.945 --> 02:27.713
They organized and fought hard
for those fair wages

02:27.715 --> 02:28.881
until they were tracked down
in their homes

02:28.883 --> 02:30.849
and shot on site
by white mobs.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.619
Their bodies were thrown
in unmarked graves nearby.

02:33.621 --> 02:37.789
We believe one of those graves
is on our land.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.993
This means
there's a burial site
on our family's land

02:40.995 --> 02:43.862
and we can prove it.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.898
Can't let Landry
take this land from us.

02:45.900 --> 02:46.999
That can't happen.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.101
No, we can't.

02:49.470 --> 02:52.004
But maybe your co-op idea

02:52.006 --> 02:53.972
helps us beat him
at his own game.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.575
How's it going?
Are folks coming on-board?

02:56.577 --> 02:58.577
It's going.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.445
I don't know
if it's fast enough
for us to make a play

03:00.447 --> 03:02.915
on that outlet mall
Landry been eyeing.

03:02.917 --> 03:05.050
Billie been helping out
with the structure,

03:05.819 --> 03:08.387
explaining the paperwork
to folk,

03:08.389 --> 03:09.855
and Prosper was first in.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.924
Hmm. Love that man.

03:11.926 --> 03:13.625
And props to Billie, I mean,
it's pretty amazing

03:13.627 --> 03:14.660
that she's doing this
for St. Joe

03:14.662 --> 03:16.094
after what she went
through here.

03:16.096 --> 03:19.898
[Ralph Angel] Yeah.
We got Parthena, Mr. Prosper,

03:19.900 --> 03:21.867
about 11 other farmers
locked in.

03:21.869 --> 03:22.834
Wow, Ralph.

03:22.836 --> 03:26.838
And Cardale is about 75% in.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.473
If he comes,
everybody else will follow.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.008
[Charley]
Keep working on 'em.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.977
I know from my time
on the board
of Landry Enterprises,

03:31.979 --> 03:34.813
the company tends
to be overleveraged.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.516
So if the Co-op bids
for the mall,

03:37.518 --> 03:39.952
Landry won't be able
to handle a counter bid

03:39.954 --> 03:42.888
and take over management
of our farm
in the same quarter.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.990
We can stretch
him then, force them

03:44.992 --> 03:47.459
to focus on the mall,
leave us alone.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.361
It's a big play.

03:49.363 --> 03:53.265
Well, for me the Co-op
is about self-determination
for Black farmers.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.033
If something else comes
with that, that's cool,

03:55.035 --> 04:00.072
but Landry been hating
Bordelons for generations.

04:00.941 --> 04:01.974
He ain't gonna give up
that easy.

04:01.976 --> 04:03.442
Then we buy time.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.944
Stall him while we work
to get the land

04:05.946 --> 04:09.181
declared a historic landmark
based on finding the remains.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.818
That's good.
That's really good.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.988
I mean, it takes time to get
a landmark designation,

04:15.990 --> 04:18.991
but if we do,
Landry won't be able
to build on it,

04:18.993 --> 04:21.193
develop it or change anything.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.462
It'll make the land
almost useless to him.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.696
Exactly.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.965
He hates us, but not enough
to waste his money on land

04:26.967 --> 04:28.433
-he can't fully monetize.
-[Ralph Angel] Nice.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.136
I'll work my connections
at the state capital,

04:31.138 --> 04:34.773
see if we can get things
moving along
on the historic designation,

04:34.775 --> 04:35.874
while Ralph works
the Co-op angle.

04:35.876 --> 04:39.144
We're not giving up
until this is over.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.980
Yeah, as long as
we breathing,
it'll never be over.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.016
Facts.

04:44.018 --> 04:45.250
[all chuckle]

04:49.023 --> 04:51.089
[Violet coughing]

04:51.091 --> 04:53.592
Blue, be careful
with that spray.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.627
You're gonna suffocate us.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.962
Sorry, Aunt Vi,
I just wanted everything

04:56.964 --> 05:00.265
to be sanitized
for my baby sister.

05:00.267 --> 05:04.102
Oh, and how does it feel
to almost be a big brother?

05:05.139 --> 05:07.172
Tremendous.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.373
Inspiring.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.276
Inspiring? Why inspiring?

05:11.278 --> 05:14.046
I read somewhere
that when a new life
comes into the world,

05:14.048 --> 05:16.748
it can inspire other people
to be better,

05:16.750 --> 05:19.484
and we should
all wanna be better.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.453
You are something else, boy.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.455
You are some kinda wonderful.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.991
I already have her name
all picked out, too.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.659
You do?

05:27.661 --> 05:30.028
Yeah. I've been sending
Pops my recommendations.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.097
Okay, well then,
hit me with your best shot.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.198
Ready for it.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.167
Gertrude.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.968
Gertrude?

05:39.006 --> 05:41.106
Oh, you.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.811
Oh, I love you.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.346
I love you, too.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.114
-I miss you.
-I miss you.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.416
Yeah.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.887
I called you earlier.
Busy with work?

05:55.889 --> 05:57.923
I had to take
a quick day trip.

05:57.925 --> 05:58.757
Really? Where to?

05:58.759 --> 06:00.959
Baton Rouge.

06:00.961 --> 06:04.329
What, what were you doing
in Baton Rouge?
Were you...

06:04.798 --> 06:06.598
I was.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.767
Brother's been working hard
for you.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.203
I snagged
a last-minute meeting
with a bigwig

06:11.205 --> 06:13.405
at the state's division
of Historic Preservation.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.042
Wait...

06:17.044 --> 06:18.844
Is that what I think it is?

06:18.846 --> 06:20.145
They approved the landmark.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.449
Oh, my God.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.221
Dominic, thank you.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.358
[Nova exclaims]

06:37.731 --> 06:39.164
Thank you.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.137
Eight-ball on the pocket.

06:47.307 --> 06:48.640
[grunts]

06:48.642 --> 06:50.776
Oh, shit!

06:50.778 --> 06:53.979
[chuckles] I guess
I ain't the man
I used to be, huh?

06:53.981 --> 06:55.747
Can't blame a brother
for trying though, right?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.115
No, I guess not.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.784
Where our money, though?

06:58.786 --> 07:01.219
I got you. I got you.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.988
I'm a man of my word.

07:03.157 --> 07:04.389
Oh, damn!

07:05.459 --> 07:07.626
[exclaims]

07:07.628 --> 07:09.461
Y'all boys about wiped me out.

07:09.463 --> 07:12.764
Cleans yourself out
talking all that smack.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.166
But I'll buy you
a drink, though.

07:14.168 --> 07:15.467
It's your own money,
of course.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.106
Boy, that hit me
a real bad streak.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.809
Need to make some money
real quick.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.811
Man, you know,
looking for some work
or something, man.

07:25.813 --> 07:26.945
Ain't we all?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.014
I don't think you heard me,
man.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.950
I'm looking
for that "work" work.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.353
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.357
I think you do.

07:40.127 --> 07:44.596
Now look here, man,
I'm being real nice

07:44.598 --> 07:46.932
by letting you keep my money

07:46.934 --> 07:49.267
in front of your little
bitch ass friends.

07:50.003 --> 07:53.805
I wouldn't wanna ruin your rep
by snatching it back

07:53.807 --> 07:55.207
right before
I bust you over the head

07:55.209 --> 07:57.175
with this goddamn pool cue.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.113
There's a guy.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.783
I think his name's Theo.

08:04.785 --> 08:05.851
Theo?

08:05.853 --> 08:08.119
He can make you
some real money.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.855
He work risky, though.
I ain't with him.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.890
But if you need something,

08:11.892 --> 08:13.925
you gotta scheme a day
it seem like.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.060
Where he at?

08:15.262 --> 08:16.928
Where he staying?

08:16.930 --> 08:18.163
Next parish over.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.033
I bet.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.071
Hey!

08:27.074 --> 08:28.440
<i> [Charley] So have you</i>
<i>  heard the good news?</i>

08:28.442 --> 08:29.641
Have I heard the good news?

08:29.643 --> 08:32.244
Baby, I'm over here dancing
The Watusi.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.547
It's a beautiful thing,
isn't it?

08:35.549 --> 08:36.915
It sure is.

08:36.917 --> 08:41.152
And I would pay good money
to see Sam Landry's face

08:41.154 --> 08:45.390
when he finds out
he did not get our farm.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.993
He basically got a museum.

08:47.995 --> 08:52.397
Well, why don't we
get you seeing his face
sooner than later?

08:52.399 --> 08:54.099
What's on your mind?

08:54.101 --> 08:56.701
[Charley]
<i>  Despite his best efforts</i>
<i>  to act otherwise,</i>

08:56.703 --> 08:59.104
Sam respects you.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.606
Think you could lure him
to the diner tomorrow?

09:01.608 --> 09:03.475
I have an idea
for a final play

09:03.477 --> 09:07.012
that could make him
give us back the farm.

09:07.014 --> 09:10.916
Oh, baby, consider that done.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.417
Thanks, Aunt Vi.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.956
Yes.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.191
Morning, Daddy.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.826
Hello. Morning, sweetie.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.929
Oh, those are pretty.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.830
It's nice to see you
celebrate yourself.

09:25.832 --> 09:30.001
Actually, I'm celebrating you.

09:30.003 --> 09:33.305
You know that saying
"Give people their flowers
while you can."

09:33.941 --> 09:35.473
Well, here you go.

09:37.511 --> 09:40.545
And what did I do
to deserve this?

09:40.547 --> 09:44.449
Because you were the first
to commit your rescue subsidy
for the Co-op?

09:44.451 --> 09:47.052
I mean, you're not just trying
to survive,

09:47.054 --> 09:49.821
you're aiming to prosper.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.824
Thank you, sweetie. Hmm.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.994
Oh, um, was that...

09:55.996 --> 09:58.430
Vince I heard you
talking to earlier today?

09:58.432 --> 09:59.397
How's he doing?

10:00.701 --> 10:03.768
The truth is, Daddy, I, um,

10:03.770 --> 10:05.837
I've been living
in an empty nest now

10:05.839 --> 10:07.973
with a good man.

10:09.776 --> 10:13.011
He's a friend at this point,
more than anything else.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.948
He knows it and I know it.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.217
I think we both
want something more,

10:19.219 --> 10:21.052
but we're just too afraid
to say it.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.954
Hmm.

10:23.890 --> 10:27.359
So I'm gonna call him tomorrow
and we'll see.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.828
We'll see.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.296
Yeah.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.034
[knocking on door]

10:36.036 --> 10:37.335
Come in.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.139
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:42.175 --> 10:46.044
I got your text
and the food you left.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.245
Thank you.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.186
So, what's up?

10:56.757 --> 10:58.189
I have something for you.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.460
I wanted you to have this.

11:05.866 --> 11:06.598
You're giving this to me.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.933
I am.

11:08.935 --> 11:13.271
This is my way of saying,
"I know I was an ass."

11:14.775 --> 11:19.044
Yeah, you were.
Big time.

11:19.046 --> 11:22.714
Yeah, I don't usually
let people's opinions of me
get to me,

11:22.716 --> 11:25.116
but I did.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.420
I'm not proud of that.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.055
And I wasn't cool

11:30.057 --> 11:32.057
when I got weird
about you touching me.

11:34.327 --> 11:38.063
I'm sorry, truly.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.102
Cool.

11:44.104 --> 11:49.140
Then I, I guess,
I accept your apology.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.745
-I gotta get to class.
-Right.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.114
But I, I think
we should really talk

11:56.116 --> 11:59.284
just about
what the real issue is.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.853
What do you mean real issue?

12:01.855 --> 12:03.755
You know, I...
I just don't think it's about

12:03.757 --> 12:08.193
what other people think
of you or me or us.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.029
I think we have to get
to the bottom

12:11.031 --> 12:14.199
of why that fight happened
in the first place.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.935
Hmm.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.473
Isaiah...

12:24.811 --> 12:27.312
I just, I really feel like
we have a strong...

12:28.849 --> 12:30.081
connection.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.785
Yeah, we do.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.320
And I feel like...

12:38.091 --> 12:40.091
we should get to the bottom
of what that is.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.932
Oh, wow.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.968
This farm.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.971
A historic monument.

12:54.841 --> 12:57.075
Nobody puttin' no bullshit
on it now.

12:57.844 --> 13:00.011
Ain't no mall.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.280
Nothing' my daddy
wouldn't wanna see.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.450
-It's gonna be here forever.
-Mm-hmm.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.022
-My love.
-[exhales]

13:11.024 --> 13:13.191
I almost lost it all.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.959
But you didn't.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.196
You didn't.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.334
Still gotta sign them papers
for Landry by end of the week.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.906
At least now we know
it'll be here

13:27.908 --> 13:30.074
waiting for us
when we get it back.

13:31.211 --> 13:34.846
And we will get it back.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.948
As God is my witness.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.650
As God is my witness.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.351
And you, too.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.827
Now you sure you need me
to chip in the whole thing,

13:48.829 --> 13:50.128
the settlement
and the subsidy?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.831
Ain't gonna work
unless we go all in.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.332
Just won't have enough.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.735
I'm telling you,
that land is good.

13:57.737 --> 14:00.004
It's a solid move
to own and farm.

14:00.974 --> 14:04.042
Might even distract Landry
from our personal farms.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.016
If you keep the money,

14:13.153 --> 14:15.220
it's gonna make
a difference for what?

14:16.189 --> 14:19.090
One harvest? Two?

14:19.659 --> 14:21.960
Then what?

14:23.430 --> 14:29.634
We're all back to the same
old hustle, grind, bait
and switch every year.

14:29.636 --> 14:34.239
Season after season,
fighting the banks,

14:34.241 --> 14:39.377
hoping that they have mercy
on us, make a meal out of us.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.180
Same old, same old.

14:42.949 --> 14:49.153
This, this is our chance
to break the cycle.

14:51.091 --> 14:56.027
Ms. Darla, you make
this thing sound so good

14:56.029 --> 14:57.829
like a pipe dream.

14:57.831 --> 14:59.931
It ain't no dream.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.699
It's a real one.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.801
One we can make happen.

15:03.803 --> 15:06.137
You miss every shot
you don't take.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.008
-It's time
we started shootin'.
-[sighs]

15:21.087 --> 15:22.921
Appreciate you trusting me.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.455
It's no problem, boy.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.026
I don't know
if this is gonna work,

15:28.028 --> 15:31.195
but I sure as hell
wanna see my kids
off their knees one day.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.197
Amen to that.

15:33.199 --> 15:35.133
Amen to that.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.535
[Prosper] Uh, sweetie?

15:37.537 --> 15:40.138
Yeah.

15:40.140 --> 15:44.309
Uh, what's a ten-letter word
for foolish starts with an I?

15:45.879 --> 15:50.048
Um... irrational.

15:50.050 --> 15:53.117
Oh, yeah, that's a good one.

15:57.924 --> 16:00.992
So, how did your talk
with Vince go?

16:00.994 --> 16:03.061
Not so good.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.133
I'm sorry to hear that.

16:11.705 --> 16:13.504
Now, you do love him,
don't you?

16:13.506 --> 16:17.008
I've never felt that way
about anybody, ever.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.043
That whole fairy tale love
that you and mama had

16:19.045 --> 16:21.746
with the butterflies
and the passion...

16:21.748 --> 16:23.247
and trust...

16:26.252 --> 16:29.053
I haven't trusted a man
in a long time.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.023
Not even Vince.

16:32.025 --> 16:36.227
And he has never done nothing
but treat me right.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.432
I don't wanna feel this way,
but I do.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.802
He did this to you.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.004
Jimmy Dale.

16:46.006 --> 16:49.774
I don't want that demon
to have any more power or,

16:49.776 --> 16:52.443
or anything else over my life.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.246
You shut your heart down
because of what
he done to you.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.251
Vince said I run too much

17:00.353 --> 17:01.952
and he's not wrong.

17:04.758 --> 17:09.360
It's just that I always felt
that I needed to be able
to leave when I needed to.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.199
[sighs] I guess that's why
I never married him.

17:16.936 --> 17:20.805
Yeah, usually I would say
running was wrong,

17:20.807 --> 17:23.207
because wherever you go,
that's where you are.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.376
That's true.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.816
I understand you guarding
your heart, sweetie,

17:31.818 --> 17:33.785
because it can be
a cold world,

17:33.787 --> 17:36.287
but sometimes
it can be warm, too.

17:39.059 --> 17:43.895
You know, the way I see it,
that if you gotta run,

17:43.897 --> 17:46.330
there's no better place
to run than home.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.234
And this time
I'm here to catch you.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.514
Good God Almighty,
you never lied about this.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.850
This ain't strong,
it's krong.

18:05.852 --> 18:08.586
Well, you're a man
who look like
he can handle his business,

18:08.588 --> 18:10.054
so there you go.

18:10.056 --> 18:12.023
-How about another?
-Oh, no, no, man.

18:12.025 --> 18:14.158
What you trying to
do to me?

18:14.160 --> 18:15.927
Man, gotta know
when to say when.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.061
Uh-huh.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.963
I ain't from
around these parts.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.498
It's the third
pitcher tonight.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.467
You trying to do a crawl?

18:22.469 --> 18:24.535
You're supposed
to have more folks
with you to do that.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.472
No, man, I just got back
from overseas.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.975
I've been slavin'
for Uncle Sam
for a while, man.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.176
You know what I'm saying?

18:32.178 --> 18:33.744
Hmm. I see.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.980
Well, congratulations to you.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.749
That explains
your strong constitution.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.319
You've been messin'
with that international drink.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.989
No, but really, man.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.825
Look, I'm trying
to surprise my brother.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.127
Uh-huh.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.028
His name is...

18:51.030 --> 18:53.030
His name is Theo.

18:53.032 --> 18:53.831
You seen him?

18:53.833 --> 18:55.333
Theo?

18:56.803 --> 18:57.635
You don't know
where own brother is?

18:57.637 --> 18:59.070
Not exactly.

18:59.072 --> 19:01.038
Hell, truth be told, man,
the last time
we was together,

19:01.040 --> 19:04.008
it wasn't so good.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.177
We got into it
over some ol' country gal.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.678
Ah!

19:07.680 --> 19:09.580
Old silly brother stuff.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.183
A big-legged country gal
would do it every time.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.754
Yeah, I'm just trying
to make things right.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.756
I know he used
to live in this parish.

19:18.758 --> 19:22.827
So, you know,
just I don't know,
I want to surprise him, man.

19:22.829 --> 19:23.961
You sure you ain't seen him?

19:23.963 --> 19:26.597
Yeah, yeah. I seen Theo.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.300
He come in here
about three nights a week,

19:29.969 --> 19:32.270
usually, right before
closing time.

19:33.840 --> 19:38.109
-You don't say.
-It's right.

19:38.111 --> 19:41.812
You know what,
I think I'm gonna sit here
and do me another one.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.814
My man!

19:43.816 --> 19:45.917
I'm gonna wait on Theo.
It might be my lucky night.

19:45.919 --> 19:47.151
You know what?

19:47.153 --> 19:49.153
It's good of you to do that
for your brother.

19:49.155 --> 19:49.987
It is, ain't it?

19:49.989 --> 19:51.722
Yes, sir.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.025
Ol' Theo about to be
in the surprise of his life.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.226
I'll drink to that, boss.

20:02.135 --> 20:04.468
How's your family doing?

20:04.470 --> 20:06.637
With everything
that's going on?

20:06.639 --> 20:09.106
Better than I expected,
you know,

20:09.108 --> 20:13.044
but we're not taking it
lying down,
we're fighting back.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.745
Yeah, that's beautiful, man.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.914
It really is.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.816
Had to remind myself that.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.318
Why is that?

20:21.621 --> 20:22.720
You know,
when you're in school,

20:22.722 --> 20:24.222
you feel like you can
change everything,

20:24.224 --> 20:27.258
you know, just go in
and tear it down.

20:28.294 --> 20:30.261
Start over, live free.

20:31.831 --> 20:36.968
But you're starting
to feel the walls, right?

20:36.970 --> 20:38.536
[exhales] Yeah.

20:38.538 --> 20:42.139
The walls push back hard.

20:46.112 --> 20:50.648
Sorry, I feel like
I'm talking so much,
I just get that way when--

20:50.650 --> 20:52.250
When you're nervous?

20:55.455 --> 20:57.688
Can I say something
kinda direct?

20:57.724 --> 21:00.658
Yeah.

21:00.660 --> 21:06.230
I think it's easier
for you to embrace
all of your politics

21:07.800 --> 21:12.069
but not so much
to embrace your own reality.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.108
Can we sit down for a second?

21:18.044 --> 21:20.011
Yeah.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.118
[people chattering
indistinctly]

21:31.991 --> 21:35.126
To the extent that anybody
can be sure about anything,

21:35.128 --> 21:37.995
I don't think I'm gay.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.165
But I do have feelings
for you.

21:42.268 --> 21:45.036
I mean, that's confusing.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.641
I feel like my sense of self

21:50.643 --> 21:55.146
and my emotional attraction
are at odds,

21:55.715 --> 21:59.283
like, the way I feel for you
in my heart

22:00.086 --> 22:06.390
doesn't match my feelings
for you in other ways.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.128
So you don't wanna sleep
with me?

22:11.130 --> 22:13.130
I don't wanna sleep with you.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.300
I can forgive you for that.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.205
But you should know, though,

22:23.209 --> 22:25.376
I don't want anything
from you, Micah.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.013
I never did.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.817
Nothing except
to be your friend...

22:32.885 --> 22:35.753
your brother.

22:35.755 --> 22:39.123
But society tells us
that men can't love
each other that way.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.393
You know, we don't do that.

22:43.696 --> 22:48.766
Women can be best friends,
they can hold hands,

22:48.768 --> 22:53.504
they can declare their love
for each other, but we can't.

22:53.506 --> 22:56.173
You know, and...
and if we do,
then we must be gay.

22:56.175 --> 23:00.077
-Exactly.
-You just said
what I couldn't put together,

23:00.079 --> 23:01.278
like your brain is just--

23:01.280 --> 23:02.880
-Fantastic.
-Fantastic.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.248
Yeah.

23:04.250 --> 23:08.152
You're so... you really are.

23:09.455 --> 23:11.155
You are, too.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.228
I love you.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.131
I love you, too.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.906
I wish I had a St. Joe
growing up.

23:28.908 --> 23:34.945
Small town, big heart,
that people there
really see each other.

23:34.947 --> 23:38.816
It's a community there
in the best sense of the word.

23:38.818 --> 23:41.051
It's really a beautiful thing.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.520
It's all true.

23:42.522 --> 23:45.923
But when I was a kid,
all I wanted to do
was get away.

23:45.925 --> 23:49.693
Now it's one
of the most important places
in the world to me.

23:49.695 --> 23:51.829
I can also see
how it took a city

from such a rich,
deeply-rooted place.

24:02.175 --> 24:05.276
It's the nicest thing anyone's
said to me in a long time.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.178
I feel like the world

24:07.180 --> 24:08.913
sees me as a problem,

24:08.915 --> 24:10.881
something to be solved,

I hope I never made you
feel like that.

Look, I...

24:31.737 --> 24:35.072
I know I put the brakes
on things between us before.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.474
But the truth is, I...

24:36.476 --> 24:38.309
I didn't just want
a moment with you.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.946
I've made that mistake before,

make it again.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.117
Not with you.

24:47.854 --> 24:50.120
You deserve better than that.

24:51.457 --> 24:55.125
You deserve all that someone
can give to a woman.

24:56.829 --> 25:01.932
And I wanna give that to you,
if you'll let me.

25:04.337 --> 25:07.304
I've done some tough work
on myself recently.

25:09.075 --> 25:14.979
And I've come to know
that I have mistaken passion
for love far too many times.

25:15.781 --> 25:19.183
I've been hurt deeply.

25:21.721 --> 25:24.154
I don't wanna hurt you, Nova.

25:24.156 --> 25:25.456
I've also come to know

25:25.458 --> 25:26.457
I've spent a lot of energy

25:26.459 --> 25:27.858
explaining why I am,

25:27.860 --> 25:31.262
who I am and how I am.

25:32.798 --> 25:34.398
And I won't do it again.

25:35.801 --> 25:38.435
I wanna explain why I exist
as God made me.

25:39.839 --> 25:43.908
Well, if life
has taught me anything,

25:43.910 --> 25:48.245
it's that God
doesn't make mistakes.

25:49.715 --> 25:52.449

didn't make any
when it comes to you.

First bid that
the Co-op is putting in

37:04.556 --> 37:07.023
is for a very nice slice
of land

37:07.025 --> 37:09.993
that you've been eyeing over
around the outlet mall.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.162
What?

37:12.164 --> 37:14.798
[laughs]
Oh, girl, please.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.733
You think
you're gonna waltz in here

37:16.735 --> 37:20.470
with your little so-called
Black empowerment plan

37:20.472 --> 37:22.205
and mess up my business?

37:23.709 --> 37:25.709
I hope Ralph Angel likes
the idea of going back to jail

37:25.711 --> 37:28.778
because that's exactly
where he's headed,
if you don't back off.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.380
Ralph Angel
ain't going nowhere.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.417
Say what you
were brought here to say.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.423
I'm here to tell the truth
about what happened.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.860
About how we set up
Ralph Angel.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.162
We have
an understanding, Theo.

37:50.302 --> 37:53.803
Like I said,
I'm here to tell the truth.

37:53.805 --> 37:57.140
You and your daddy
have done enough damage
to me and these people.

37:57.142 --> 37:58.441
You will do no such thing.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.277
I will have you arrested, too.
Do you hear me?

38:00.279 --> 38:02.379
Don't yell at me no more,
Parker Campbell!

38:03.081 --> 38:04.447
I'm done.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.082
I know too much.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.219
You don't wanna cross me.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.989
I'm done with y'all using me.

38:12.991 --> 38:14.257
[Hollywood]
It's all good, brother.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.192
We got it now.

38:17.763 --> 38:19.996
Parker, know when to say when.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.867
We've neutralized
your development plans
for the farm.

38:23.869 --> 38:26.303
We'll win the outlet mall
or bleed you dry trying

38:26.972 --> 38:30.006
and if you move on my brother,

38:30.008 --> 38:31.241
we'll charge you
with entrapment.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.010
It's deal time.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.912
And you know it.

38:42.054 --> 38:44.521
Get the farmers
to drop their bid
on the land for the mall

38:44.523 --> 38:47.057
and you can have
your little farm back.

38:50.395 --> 38:53.163
We'll talk with Ralph Angel
and let you know.

38:58.070 --> 38:59.202
Parker?

39:00.739 --> 39:03.373
I'm really glad that you came
instead of your father.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.143
This was a lot more fun.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.019
[Ralph Angel] I mean,
yeah, yeah,

39:16.021 --> 39:17.654
she's... she's in a lot
of pain right now.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.155
How fast can you get here?

39:19.157 --> 39:20.890
[doula on phone]
<i>  Judging from what you shared,</i>

39:20.892 --> 39:23.193
<i>  the midwife</i>
<i>  and I won't make it in time.</i>

39:23.195 --> 39:24.894
<i>  -She's close.</i>
<i> -For real?</i>

39:24.896 --> 39:26.730
<i> [doula] But I'm gonna talk</i>
<i>  you guys through this</i>
<i>  over the phone. Okay?</i>

39:26.732 --> 39:27.964
Okay.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.799
-[Darla panting]
Ralph Angel.
-Oh, baby, baby. Hold up.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.634
<i> [doula] Slow,</i>
<i>  cleansing breaths.</i>

39:31.636 --> 39:33.837
-Breathe, baby,
breathe, breathe.
<i> -[doula] You can do this.</i>

39:33.839 --> 39:36.439
<i>  Great job, Darla.</i>
<i>  You're doing really good.</i>

39:36.441 --> 39:38.341
-[Darla] Oh, God.
-[Ralph Angel
speaking indistinctly]

39:39.211 --> 39:40.744
Blue, you wanna give
your mama some space?

39:40.746 --> 39:41.711
I want to stay.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.146
<i> -[doula] All right.</i>
<i> -You got it, baby.</i>

39:43.148 --> 39:45.448
<i> [doula] You're doing great.</i>
<i>  You're doing great, Darla.</i>

39:45.450 --> 39:47.450
We can't do this alone.

39:47.452 --> 39:49.152
-I don't know what I'm doing.
-Darla?

39:49.154 --> 39:50.120
<i> [doula] You're okay.</i>

39:50.122 --> 39:51.921
Listen to me, Darla.

39:51.923 --> 39:52.822
I cannot do this alone.

39:52.824 --> 39:56.059
Darla, baby is coming,
she's ready.

39:56.695 --> 39:57.494
She saying she ready.

39:57.496 --> 39:58.861
-Okay.
-Okay. You ready.

39:58.863 --> 40:00.630
<i> -[doula] Come on, Darla,</i>
<i>  you can do this.</i>
<i> -You're ready.</i>

40:00.632 --> 40:02.766
-Come on.
-Hey.

40:02.768 --> 40:04.334
We got your message.
We came as soon as we could.

40:04.336 --> 40:05.869
What do you want us to do?

40:05.871 --> 40:08.872
You can get some,
some warm water ready,
and some hot bath towels?

40:08.874 --> 40:09.973
-I got you.
-Thank you.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.908
Prosper, can you take
Blue with you?

40:11.910 --> 40:13.009
-Okay. Come on, son.
-Come on.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.878
[Prosper] I got him. Come on.
Come on. Come on, son.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.680
-Right now. Come on.
-There you go, baby.
You got this.

40:17.682 --> 40:19.149
<i> [doula] You guys</i>
<i>  are doing great. Okay?</i>

40:19.151 --> 40:21.851
Look at you.
I'm so proud of you.

40:21.853 --> 40:24.454
Okay. Okay.

40:24.456 --> 40:25.955
No more sitting.

40:25.957 --> 40:27.957
I wanna stand up here.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.026
-Baby--
-Okay, come on.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.962
I got you. I got you.

40:32.964 --> 40:35.265
I got you. I got you.
Shh.

40:38.870 --> 40:41.271
Oh, baby, I got you.

40:42.874 --> 40:43.706
You're doing incredible.

40:43.708 --> 40:45.175
Hmm.

40:45.177 --> 40:46.910
You're doing perfect, baby.

40:46.912 --> 40:48.978
Don't worry about it.
I got you.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.980
[Darla groaning]

40:50.982 --> 40:52.148
[Ralph Angel] That's okay.

40:52.451 --> 40:54.117
[Darla] Oh, my God!

40:55.454 --> 40:57.454
Oh, my God!

40:57.456 --> 40:58.922
Oh, my God!

40:58.924 --> 41:00.156
Oh, my God!

41:03.228 --> 41:04.961
[Ralph Angel] Okay, baby.

41:13.038 --> 41:15.138
Bathtub.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.140
Our daughter wants
to meet us.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.777
-Come on.
-Yeah.

41:20.779 --> 41:22.445
