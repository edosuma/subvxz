WEBVTT

00:07.757 --> 00:09.217
I'm calling about Laura and Andy.

00:11.928 --> 00:13.346
I want to leave the program.

00:13.430 --> 00:16.266
You want to walk out of here
and get <i>yourself</i> killed, that's up to you.

00:16.349 --> 00:19.102
<i>You sign out now,</i>
<i>and you're putting Andy's life at risk.</i>

00:19.936 --> 00:21.771
I want the papers. Now.

00:22.522 --> 00:23.982
This is a mistake.

00:24.983 --> 00:27.026
This new roommate, what's his name?

00:27.110 --> 00:28.319
Nick Harp.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.071
<i>I want to meet him.</i>

00:30.155 --> 00:31.614
<i>You'll love him.</i>

00:33.199 --> 00:34.576
Perfect. We'll talk soon.

00:34.659 --> 00:36.578
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>what you two have been through.</i>

00:36.661 --> 00:39.372
<i>There are people</i>
<i>who could hurt you. Hurt your mom.</i>

00:39.456 --> 00:40.540
<i>As she's a Queller?</i>

00:40.623 --> 00:42.375
I'm so glad you took me up on this.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.166
<i>So, instead of doing your job,</i>

01:23.249 --> 01:25.919
<i>you take Andrea Oliver</i>
<i>to her long-lost uncle?</i>

01:26.544 --> 01:28.296
<i>She knows</i>
<i>more than she's saying.</i>

01:28.379 --> 01:29.839
<i>If I take her to see Queller,</i>

01:29.923 --> 01:32.467
<i>she's gonna open up</i>
<i>about her mother's past.</i>

01:33.176 --> 01:34.886
<i>Something is off about this case.</i>

01:35.720 --> 01:38.348
Something happen out there
you haven't told me about?

01:41.476 --> 01:42.310
No.

01:42.393 --> 01:46.606
Laura signed out of the program
yesterday, meaning her daughter's out.

01:46.689 --> 01:47.982
Why would she do that?

01:48.066 --> 01:49.275
Not our problem anymore.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.277
They're expecting you back
in Atlanta tomorrow.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.905
<i>Finish your report before you leave.</i>

02:29.023 --> 02:30.024
Hello, Andy?

02:30.567 --> 02:31.442
<i>You there?</i>

02:31.526 --> 02:32.819
Ms. Oliver?

02:32.902 --> 02:36.030
<i>This is Michael Vargas</i>
<i>of the US Marshal Service in El Paso.</i>

02:36.114 --> 02:37.991
What are you doing with Andrea's phone?

02:38.074 --> 02:39.159
She left it with me.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.910
<i>Is… Is she okay? Where is she?</i>

02:41.536 --> 02:45.540
I took her to see Jasper Queller,
and she left with him.

02:49.085 --> 02:49.919
<i>Hello?</i>

02:54.966 --> 02:56.050
So, um…

02:57.927 --> 03:01.264
What, she just left the car,
left… left her things?

03:01.347 --> 03:02.223
<i>Her things?</i>

03:04.350 --> 03:05.852
What would those be exactly?

03:12.942 --> 03:13.776
<i>Ms. Oliver?</i>

04:01.032 --> 04:01.866
Miss Oliver.

04:02.450 --> 04:03.868
Hi. Morning.

04:04.702 --> 04:05.787
I'm Mrs. Barfield.

04:06.329 --> 04:09.165
Mr. Queller had an early meeting,
but he'll be back soon.

04:10.458 --> 04:13.753
Thanks. And thanks for the, uh, clothes.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.713
Breakfast will be in the dining room.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.423
Okay.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.994
- Do you play?

05:28.995 --> 05:30.455
Not even <i>Chopsticks.</i>

05:31.581 --> 05:32.915
No, I get it.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.002
Must be intimidating to know
your mother has that kind of talent.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.504
You know, I didn't get near a piano
when I was a kid.

05:39.464 --> 05:40.340
Mom played?

05:40.882 --> 05:42.467
Yeah, that's pretty much all she did.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.303
You know, I think Dad filmed every note.

05:46.387 --> 05:48.139
Like… home movies?

05:48.222 --> 05:49.057
Yeah.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.559
I'll have Mrs. Barfield
see if she can find them.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.144
Come on, I'll show you around.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.148
So, how was it growing up in Belle Isle?

05:58.441 --> 05:59.442
Oh, uh…

05:59.525 --> 06:00.860
Picture some place like this.

06:00.943 --> 06:04.447
Only smaller, shittier, with alligators.

06:05.323 --> 06:08.242
And that is about the last place
I can imagine my sister.

06:09.994 --> 06:10.995
What was she like?

06:13.331 --> 06:14.665
Oh, serious.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.085
- A perfectionist.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.002
Sounds familiar.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.504
Very private.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.422
Hmm.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.552
Have you heard of a woman
named Paula Kunde?

06:28.596 --> 06:30.723
Yeah, she was in
the Army of the Changing World.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.184
She was an acolyte of Nick Harp.

06:35.019 --> 06:36.813
How would my mom know Paula?

06:37.605 --> 06:40.608
Well, she…
She really has kept you in the dark.

06:43.528 --> 06:48.032
Our brother Andrew, uh,
met Nick at Stanford.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.992
And they were gonna change the world.

06:50.618 --> 06:51.786
Then, Oslo happened.

06:52.453 --> 06:53.287
Wait.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.414
Nick Harp killed your father?

06:56.082 --> 06:58.584
No, he handed a gun to a woman who did.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.753
And she's dead.

07:02.213 --> 07:03.631
And he's still out there.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.468
He's the reason
my mother went into Witness Protection.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.179
Well. No, I don't know, but, uh…

07:11.264 --> 07:14.267
after Andrew died, she, she disappeared.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.769
You know, they were so close.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.021
How did Andrew die?

07:20.606 --> 07:23.734
Well, I never really
got the whole story, but, uh,

07:23.818 --> 07:26.154
he was with Nick when it happened.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.532
Mom's been living
with this all these years.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.492
Look, you've both been through a lot.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.369
But you're safe here.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.998
We'll talk more later.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.499
Anything you need, let me know.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.168
This is your home.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.171
- You're a Queller.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.215
- Cynthia. Hi.
- Morning.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.968
- You may need to call…
- Sure.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.222
<i>Martin Queller made millions</i>

07:53.306 --> 07:58.769
<i>from AZT, Haldol, RU486,</i>
<i>and other controversial medications.</i>

07:58.853 --> 08:02.106
<i>But his Midas touch</i>
<i>came to an end in 1988,</i>

08:02.190 --> 08:06.903
<i>when the Army of the Changing World</i>
<i>led by Nick Harp took aim in Oslo.</i>

08:06.986 --> 08:10.531
<i>The Radicals kidnapped</i>
<i>Professor Alex Maplecroft</i>

08:10.615 --> 08:14.744
<i>and set Grace Juno to take her place</i>
<i>and kill Queller.</i>

08:14.827 --> 08:17.288
<i>If you find a credible argument in there,</i>
<i>let us know.</i>

08:17.788 --> 08:19.290
- <i>The year before…</i>

08:19.373 --> 08:22.627
<i>…Juno's husband Robert</i>
<i>had shot their three children and himself</i>

08:22.710 --> 08:25.588
<i>after being prescribed</i>
<i>massive doses of Haldol.</i>

08:25.671 --> 08:28.508
<i>Do you remember Robert Allen Juno?</i>

08:28.591 --> 08:30.510
<i>Yes. Very sad.</i>

08:31.177 --> 08:32.803
<i>Mr. Juno was a construction worker--</i>

08:32.887 --> 08:36.515
<i>He was an engineer,</i>
<i>and he had a brain injury.</i>

08:37.266 --> 08:42.855
<i>My husband needed help, and so they</i>
<i>pumped him full of your company's drugs.</i>

08:42.939 --> 08:44.607
<i>And he lost himself.</i>

08:44.690 --> 08:48.402
<i>And…</i>
<i>And he… He hurt our children.</i>

08:48.486 --> 08:50.988
<i>And, I wrote. And I called.</i>

08:51.072 --> 08:54.075
<i>This is not Alex Maplecroft.</i>
<i>Get this woman off the stage.</i>

08:54.158 --> 08:56.661
<i>Not just one more. Not one more!</i>

08:56.744 --> 08:57.620
<i>Mother of God!</i>

08:59.247 --> 09:00.164
Oh!

09:10.132 --> 09:11.175
<i>Father!</i>

09:34.657 --> 09:35.574
Thank you.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.244
Give me a minute, fellas. All right.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.876
Can I buy you a drink?

09:46.502 --> 09:48.045
I know it was you, Gordon.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.673
I know you called the Marshals.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.800
You didn't give me much choice, Laura.

09:53.342 --> 09:56.429
I thought that Charlie would get you
and Andy to some place safe.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.597
No.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.515
He's not taking us anywhere.

10:00.850 --> 10:01.976
I signed out.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.646
And how is that a good idea?

10:05.730 --> 10:06.856
I'll be fine.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.069
I'm leaving town for a while.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.198
What about Andy?

10:16.282 --> 10:17.742
I'm gonna go see her.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.869
She's… with my brother.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.246
In San Francisco.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.498
You have a brother in San Francisco.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.208
You are full of surprises.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.710
Isn't that why you married me?

10:27.793 --> 10:29.086
Probably.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.468
I know I don't have the right to ask--

10:35.551 --> 10:37.178
But you're gonna ask anyway.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.058
Now that Laura Oliver no longer exists,

10:42.141 --> 10:44.518
and since you still have
power-of-attorney…

10:45.519 --> 10:49.148
can you draw up a new will for me,
in my original name?

10:50.566 --> 10:51.651
There's only one problem.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.194
I have no idea who you are.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.124
It's all in here.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.378
Everything you need to know.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.635
Can you do it right away?

11:17.718 --> 11:19.804
I need to know Andy's taken care of.

11:19.887 --> 11:20.930
In case of what?

11:24.809 --> 11:25.643
Laura.

11:28.437 --> 11:29.271
Hey.

11:31.690 --> 11:32.566
In case of what?

11:32.650 --> 11:35.236
It's Jane… actually.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.576
Jane.

11:47.873 --> 11:48.958
One little word.

11:51.001 --> 11:54.088
And, it took all of this
for you to say it?

12:01.804 --> 12:03.055
Nice to meet you, Jane.

12:08.936 --> 12:09.895
Uh…

12:09.979 --> 12:12.606
I've, uh… I've got
a plane to catch.

12:12.690 --> 12:13.566
Okay.

12:14.525 --> 12:15.401
Thank you.

12:17.653 --> 12:18.571
For everything.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.086
I'm flying to Paris on Friday.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.380
This drug could make
a killing in the States.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.341
It's relatively untested.
Maybe we should commission a study.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.803
Maybe you should try sitting
at the big boys' table, Jasper.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.140
A rare occasion.

12:46.682 --> 12:48.309
My children all together again.

12:48.392 --> 12:51.854
It's Nick's fault. He didn't want
to go home for winter break.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.565
- Nick, how do you find Palo Alto?

12:55.191 --> 12:57.067
Uh, I just follow the trail of BMWs.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.444
And crack vials.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.488
They sell more drugs than you do, Dad.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.615
At a greater profit margin, no doubt.

13:02.698 --> 13:05.618
Says the man pimping
the most expensive drug on the planet.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.953
Andrew. I want you home more often.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.039
Why? You're always on tour.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.374
You've been asked to play
at Santa Barbara.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.793
Oh, goody.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.336
It's just a birthday party.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.588
For the President,
I'd rather slit my wrists.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.423
- Ugh. Again?
- Christ, Jasper.

13:20.674 --> 13:23.302
Reagan has done
extraordinary things for this country,

13:23.385 --> 13:24.804
and for this family.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.348
So, you might try showing
a little more respect.

13:27.431 --> 13:29.141
People are dying in the streets,

13:29.225 --> 13:31.852
and he can't even
say the word "AIDS" in public.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.729
You say that like it's a bad thing.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.231
- You're an asshole.
- I was kidding.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.650
The President and I
have discussed this.

13:37.733 --> 13:40.528
Thought he got his advice
from Nancy's astrologer.

13:40.611 --> 13:43.614
Tell me, Nick. Are you majoring
in liberal bias, like my son?

13:43.697 --> 13:45.324
Uh, not quite.

13:46.116 --> 13:48.077
Economics, sir. The graduate program.

13:48.160 --> 13:52.248
Oh. Stanford has an excellent department.
Are you interested in finance?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.250
In how it corrupts people.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.295
And what does your father do?

13:59.171 --> 14:00.589
Uh, my father was mostly a drunk.

14:01.298 --> 14:05.344
But, um, if he did have a profession,
it would've been beating up my mom.

14:05.427 --> 14:06.804
He was expert at that.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.101
But, you know, taught me a good lesson.

14:12.184 --> 14:16.272
If I wanted a future for myself,
I have to make it on my own.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.731
Self-reliance.

14:18.566 --> 14:22.069
Something my children have yet to grasp.

14:37.501 --> 14:38.502
Mm, don't stop.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.486
What are these?

15:05.529 --> 15:07.281
My father likes to keep track.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.700
Of your performances?

15:09.783 --> 15:11.243
My mistakes.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.833
That's, uh… It's extreme.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.294
He wants me to do well.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.926
That was some family dinner.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.472
You got us on a good night.

15:32.931 --> 15:35.809
Hey, well, I think we were
both raised by wolves.

15:40.689 --> 15:41.899
Sorry about your mom.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.197
Yeah.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.954
Andrew said yours died a long time ago.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.920
Sometimes I think
she's with me when I play.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.051
That's kind of lonely.

16:10.552 --> 16:11.512
What?

16:11.595 --> 16:13.013
Playing for a ghost.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.525
I'll leave you to it.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.358
<i>Don't worry about Jane.</i>

17:48.442 --> 17:50.694
I think I know my sister
a little better than you do.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.446
How long will your niece be here?

17:53.322 --> 17:55.157
I'm not sure. What is it?

17:55.240 --> 17:58.452
Miss Oliver, you were asking
about some tapes?

17:58.535 --> 18:00.162
- Uh, yeah.
- This way.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.435
Thank you.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.385
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.720
She's amazing.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.722
An extraordinary gift.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.935
If you could do that, why would you stop?

20:28.018 --> 20:29.937
Why would you ever do anything else?

20:32.648 --> 20:34.316
I found one more.

20:35.067 --> 20:35.943
Thank you.

20:43.992 --> 20:46.370
<i>I'm an artist.</i>
<i>I want to go to art school.</i>

20:46.453 --> 20:49.873
Honey, San Francisco
is a long way from here.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.124
Yeah, that's the idea.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.418
And it's expensive.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.630
You'll have to get a job too.
Do you have that kind of discipline?

20:56.713 --> 20:57.714
Clearly you have doubts.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.175
No, I'm just saying
it is harder than you think.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.470
Most parents would say,
"Congratulations, I'm so proud of you."

21:03.553 --> 21:05.389
Having talent is only part of it.

21:05.472 --> 21:08.558
Being an artist takes drive and…
And focus. And--

21:08.642 --> 21:11.395
What the fuck would you know
about being an artist?

21:11.478 --> 21:14.648
The only opinion you've had
is on what I should do with my life.

21:14.731 --> 21:18.568
I mean, when have you ever, ever tried
to actually express yourself?

21:29.913 --> 21:31.498
Hey, do you want a ride?

21:38.005 --> 21:39.298
They sent a car.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.427
What? You're just gonna go home
after playing like that?

21:45.137 --> 21:46.138
You saw me?

21:46.888 --> 21:47.889
Yeah, I saw you.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.643
Like, you go all in.

21:52.811 --> 21:56.231
You're sitting there right in front of us,
but you're not there, are you?

21:56.314 --> 21:58.608
You're really… Like you're someplace else.

21:58.692 --> 22:01.153
I can't do anything
even close to what you just did,

22:01.236 --> 22:02.654
but I know what you're hiding from.

22:03.697 --> 22:08.035
You think if you feel things,
it's gonna hurt so much it'll kill you.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.205
Look, I get it.

22:13.206 --> 22:15.000
I've felt that way most of my life.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.628
But that's not the way it has to be.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.673
You don't have to do this alone.

22:21.757 --> 22:24.843
I don't think you want to do it alone.
I think you're just…

22:25.510 --> 22:28.555
You're scared shitless that
if you let yourself out of that cage,

22:28.638 --> 22:30.223
you'll never wanna go back.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.110
That's my ride.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.043
Take me somewhere.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.193
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

24:46.276 --> 24:51.198
<i>Jane here models the latest look</i>
<i>for the uncompromising CEO of today.</i>

24:51.281 --> 24:52.657
<i>Are you ready to pillage and plunder</i>

24:52.782 --> 24:55.660
<i>while enjoying a low corporate tax rate</i>
<i>like your father?</i>

24:55.785 --> 24:57.162
<i>You have a thing about him.</i>

24:57.662 --> 24:59.247
<i>He has a thing about me.</i>

25:00.499 --> 25:02.334
<i>He thinks you like me.</i>

25:02.417 --> 25:04.794
- <i>Then he's on to something.</i>

25:04.961 --> 25:07.380
<i>Are you, uh, even allowed to date?</i>

25:07.464 --> 25:10.300
<i>Or does he feast</i>
<i>on the blood of your suitors?</i>

25:10.383 --> 25:11.551
<i>Well, you're here.</i>

25:12.469 --> 25:13.970

<i>Man, there are a lot of reasons.</i>

25:26.733 --> 25:29.110
<i>You're not the wallflower I met at dinner.</i>

25:29.194 --> 25:30.111
<i>That's a cover.</i>

<i>People can be more than one thing.</i>

25:34.157 --> 25:35.909

25:38.328 --> 25:40.038
<i>True confessions for $800.</i>

25:40.789 --> 25:44.793
<i>What would Jane do if she finally</i>
<i>stopped playing the nice girl?</i>

25:46.044 --> 25:47.045
<i>My turn now.</i>

25:52.551 --> 25:54.803
<i>Time to meet our contestant.</i>

25:54.886 --> 25:56.012

25:57.222 --> 25:59.182

25:59.266 --> 26:01.101
<i>Hopes. Dreams.</i>

26:01.184 --> 26:02.936
<i>It's a long list.</i>

26:03.895 --> 26:05.730
<i>Give us the highlights.</i>

26:07.023 --> 26:09.276
<i>I want, um,</i>

26:10.735 --> 26:12.404
<i>a ban on ballistic missiles.</i>

26:12.487 --> 26:13.488
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

26:14.155 --> 26:17.784
<i>And for Congress to impeach</i>
<i>our fascist President, you know?</i>

26:20.829 --> 26:22.581
<i>And I want to fuck you in that bed.</i>

26:24.958 --> 26:26.835
<i>Jasper is downstairs.</i>

26:26.918 --> 26:28.420
<i>He already knows about us.</i>

26:32.382 --> 26:34.134
<i>Come here, and take that shirt off.</i>

27:22.098 --> 27:22.932
Hello?

27:23.016 --> 27:24.059
Mike.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.018
<i>Andy?</i>

27:25.810 --> 27:27.020
<i>Are you at your uncle's?</i>

27:27.103 --> 27:29.731
Uh, yeah. I just saw something crazy.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.816
What do you know about Nick Harp?

27:32.525 --> 27:35.070
Why? What happened?

27:35.153 --> 27:37.155
My mom knew him.

27:38.156 --> 27:41.201
They were… They were together.

27:41.284 --> 27:43.119
<i>Not on the phone. We should meet.</i>

27:43.828 --> 27:47.499
I'm still in El Paso, but I can be
in San Francisco by tomorrow morning.

27:47.582 --> 27:51.419
Every time I think I get closer
to knowing her, she slips away.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.380
Tomorrow, all right?

27:54.172 --> 27:56.049
Noon. Pier 28.

27:56.132 --> 27:56.966
<i>Okay.</i>

28:40.802 --> 28:42.011
Want some company?

28:42.595 --> 28:44.013
Sure. Please.

28:45.181 --> 28:46.766
Oh, you're not reading that.

28:46.850 --> 28:47.934
Skimming.

28:49.853 --> 28:52.272
I, uh… I know I turned up
at the worst possible moment.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.566
I'm not here to derail everything.

28:54.649 --> 28:55.859
No, of course not.

28:56.609 --> 29:00.864
I just… need to figure out
where I fit into all this.

29:00.947 --> 29:04.659
It's like the flying monkeys
carried off my childhood.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.164
Hey, don't be too hard on your mom.

29:11.374 --> 29:13.877
I understand why
she didn't want to talk about it.

29:15.211 --> 29:20.425
When I walk into any room, I'm the guy
whose father was shot on stage.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.721
Were you in Oslo when it happened?

29:25.430 --> 29:26.264
No.

29:26.347 --> 29:31.561
No, I was, um…
I was out buying Christmas presents and…

29:32.979 --> 29:36.524
I remember coming back to the house and
seeing a bunch of feds in the driveway.

29:36.608 --> 29:41.821
And I thought, "If this is an audit,
Dad is gonna kill me if I screw it up."

29:42.989 --> 29:44.574
God, that must have been awful.

29:44.657 --> 29:46.868
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.373
Can I show you something?

29:53.249 --> 29:54.083
Sure.

30:00.757 --> 30:01.883
Did you ever meet him?

30:02.675 --> 30:03.760
My dad?

30:06.679 --> 30:07.514
No.

30:08.556 --> 30:10.016
No, I'm sorry.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.478
Mom said he died when I was two.

30:15.355 --> 30:17.816
Jane and I have got
a lot of catching up to do.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.485
It's been a long time.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.073
Was Nick around much?

30:26.741 --> 30:27.909
Nick?

30:27.992 --> 30:30.703
Before Oslo.
Did Mom spend any time with him?

30:30.787 --> 30:32.372
I mean, here at the house.

30:32.455 --> 30:35.083
No, no, no. He… He and Andrew
lived in Palo Alto. I…

30:35.166 --> 30:38.920
Look, I only met him once
at a family dinner Andrew brought him to.

30:39.629 --> 30:41.172
So, she wasn't part of his…

30:41.256 --> 30:44.050
No. No, no, no. He was… He was a monster.

30:44.133 --> 30:46.970
Jane… Jane wanted nothing to do with him.

30:50.390 --> 30:51.224
<i>He knows.</i>

30:53.893 --> 30:55.979
Dad knows about me and Nick.

30:56.062 --> 30:56.938
So?

30:57.021 --> 30:58.898
You know Martin. He doesn't share.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.191
Nick can handle himself.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.485
Dad is funny about me.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.487
You wouldn't understand.

31:04.571 --> 31:07.282
I understand. About having to share.

31:10.159 --> 31:13.288
Nick and I, we, uh…

31:16.332 --> 31:19.294
I mean, it was…
It was never really a thing. But…

31:21.045 --> 31:25.550
if there had to be someone else,
I'm glad it's you.

31:26.509 --> 31:28.177
Hey. This is Paula.

31:28.261 --> 31:29.596
I'm Jane.

31:29.679 --> 31:30.847
Yeah, I know.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.266
You bring everything?

31:34.142 --> 31:35.059
What do you think?

32:03.463 --> 32:05.089
I don't think I can do this.

32:09.469 --> 32:10.470
Hey, what's wrong?

32:34.661 --> 32:35.745
You ready?

32:48.800 --> 32:52.553
Hey, if you see a car,
flash this three times.

32:54.013 --> 32:55.181
Okay?

32:58.601 --> 32:59.686
Hey.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.483
I'm coming right back.

33:46.232 --> 33:48.526
<i>Officials say</i>
<i>there are no suspects yet</i>

33:48.609 --> 33:52.280
<i>in last night's bombing of the</i>
<i>Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Laboratory.</i>

33:52.363 --> 33:53.573
Jane, come in, will you?

33:53.656 --> 33:56.033
<i>…extensive damage</i>
<i>was done to several labs.</i>

33:56.117 --> 33:59.245
<i>The AP received a message</i>
<i>from a group claiming responsibility,</i>

33:59.328 --> 34:02.373
<i>calling themselves</i>
<i>the Army of the Changing World.</i>

34:02.457 --> 34:04.208
<i>The message promised more attacks,</i>

- S…</i>

34:16.512 --> 34:17.346
Turn that down.

34:18.056 --> 34:21.809
<i>Officials stress the laboratory</i>
<i>maintains the highest levels of security,</i>

34:21.893 --> 34:26.314
<i>and that last night's damage</i>
<i>poses absolutely no threat to the area.</i>

<i>The FBI is asking anyone about information</i>
<i>on the bombings to contact…</i>

34:31.110 --> 34:32.445
Where were you last night?

34:34.781 --> 34:36.824
I drove down to see Andrew.

34:38.034 --> 34:40.703
Andrew or Nick?

34:41.829 --> 34:43.498
You don't have to worry about me.

34:47.710 --> 34:51.422
I'm hosting a little gathering in the
spring. Thought you might play something.

34:51.506 --> 34:52.632
Mozart?

34:53.508 --> 34:54.717
Chopin would be better.

34:56.469 --> 34:59.597
You're right. Chopin would be better.

35:36.050 --> 35:37.051
Mrs. Barfield?

35:38.094 --> 35:39.387
Can I talk to you?

35:44.267 --> 35:46.018
Rewind that section again.

35:49.647 --> 35:51.190
<i>Are you at your uncle's?</i>

35:51.274 --> 35:53.276
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

35:53.359 --> 35:54.735
<i>I just saw something crazy.</i>

35:55.778 --> 35:57.697
<i>What do you know about Nick Harp?</i>

35:58.364 --> 36:00.908
<i>Why? What happened?</i>

36:00.992 --> 36:03.995
- <i>My mom knew him.</i>

36:04.078 --> 36:07.081
<i>They were… They were together.</i>

36:07.165 --> 36:09.625
<i>Not on the phone.</i>
<i>We should meet.</i>

36:09.709 --> 36:13.504
<i>I'm still in El Paso, but I can be in</i>
<i>San Francisco by tomorrow morning.</i>

36:13.588 --> 36:16.215
<i>Every time I think</i>
<i>I get closer to knowing her…</i>

36:48.080 --> 36:48.998
Let her go.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.667
We know where she's headed.

36:55.546 --> 36:56.464
Mm.

37:00.092 --> 37:00.927
How's school?

37:02.011 --> 37:03.095
I'm getting by.

37:04.305 --> 37:05.598
You're finishing in May?

37:06.390 --> 37:07.475
Mm, that's the idea.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.352
Mm.

37:09.435 --> 37:11.562
I was wondering what your plans were.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.357
I had thought there might be
a place for you at the company.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.650
Thank you, Jane.

37:18.819 --> 37:20.446
You said you were from Detroit.

37:21.364 --> 37:22.281
Yeah, Hazel Park.

37:22.865 --> 37:25.785
- Your father worked at a factory.

37:25.868 --> 37:27.787
I mean, when he was working, yeah.

37:29.538 --> 37:31.832
But you left out
the most interesting part.

37:34.293 --> 37:35.336
Nick Harp is dead.

37:38.589 --> 37:41.092
He died four years ago of an overdose.

37:41.175 --> 37:42.802
Who are you, exactly?

37:45.096 --> 37:46.305
Oh, this is ridiculous.

37:46.389 --> 37:50.518
What did you think? That you'd waltz out
with my daughter and her trust fund?

37:50.601 --> 37:51.435
Dad, please.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.354
I happen to be very serious about Jane.

37:53.437 --> 37:55.147
That might come as a surprise to you--

37:55.231 --> 37:57.733
Not really. Why wouldn't
you want to marry a Queller?

37:57.817 --> 38:01.070
You thought you could just
help yourself to whatever you wanted.

38:01.153 --> 38:03.114
Yeah, I don't want anything from you.

38:03.197 --> 38:04.949
You're a fucking gangster.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.828
Everything you own has blood on it.

38:13.624 --> 38:14.583
You coming?

38:21.590 --> 38:22.883
Pompous asshole.

38:25.845 --> 38:27.388
He was being protective.

38:27.471 --> 38:30.182
Yeah? Well, fuck him. Fuck him!

38:33.477 --> 38:34.812
Is it true, what he said?

38:34.895 --> 38:36.480
You and me. Is this real?

38:36.564 --> 38:37.690
Of course.

38:37.773 --> 38:39.692
Then you should have my back in there.

38:41.861 --> 38:42.778
Forget it.

38:43.571 --> 38:44.655
Just tell me.

38:44.739 --> 38:46.240
Look, let's get out of here.

38:47.408 --> 38:50.453
All right. It's easy, Jane. You choose.

38:50.536 --> 38:51.787
Me or your father?

38:52.621 --> 38:53.706
That's not fair.

38:53.789 --> 38:55.416
Okay, this is your chance.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.836
To live a life on your own terms.
That is all I want for you.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.547
You can leave this place right now

39:01.630 --> 39:03.924
or you'll never see me again.
I fucking promise.

39:38.375 --> 39:39.210
Hey.

39:40.336 --> 39:42.088
I wasn't sure you'd show.

39:42.171 --> 39:46.384
Look, sorry I ran out on you in El Paso.
I thought you'd try to stop me.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.468
You okay?

39:48.803 --> 39:50.304
I couldn't stay in that house.

39:52.139 --> 39:53.015
What happened?

39:54.016 --> 39:56.227
You said something yesterday
about Nick Harp?

39:58.312 --> 39:59.647
I think he's my father.

40:02.525 --> 40:04.193
I saw this video.

40:04.276 --> 40:05.986
He and my mom were together.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.655
God, the way they looked at each other.

40:09.532 --> 40:12.493
Jasper said Nick didn't even know her.
He lied to my face.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.745
- And then he--
- What?

40:15.329 --> 40:18.165
He has security everywhere.
They recorded our call.

40:18.249 --> 40:21.001
- How do you know?
- Heard it being played back.

40:24.046 --> 40:26.465
I think your uncle
has a contact in WITSEC.

40:26.549 --> 40:28.759
A Marshal.
Someone feeding him information.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.095
Someone who knew we were at that motel.

40:31.178 --> 40:33.264
Wait, you're saying Jasper sent that guy?

40:34.390 --> 40:36.142
Been thinking what he was after.

40:36.225 --> 40:38.936
He had his hands around my neck.
I'm pretty sure it was me.

40:39.019 --> 40:42.231
What if he wasn't?
What if he wanted that suitcase?

40:44.483 --> 40:48.070
I think that money's evidence,
and your uncle wants to get a hand on it.

40:48.154 --> 40:49.071
Well, where is it?

40:49.155 --> 40:50.573
Back in my hotel room.

40:52.366 --> 40:53.242
Sorry.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.706
We should get out of here.

40:59.957 --> 41:01.375
I left my car back at the hotel.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.210
Took a couple of cabs just in case.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.213
You need to get out of this place, Andy.
You're not safe.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.758
Where am I supposed to go?
You just said we can't trust anyone.

41:10.968 --> 41:12.428
Mike, what is it?

41:12.511 --> 41:14.305
Mike, what is it? Mike?

41:14.388 --> 41:15.681
I got you.

41:15.764 --> 41:17.016
Hey. Mike?

41:17.099 --> 41:18.225
Call 911!

41:20.102 --> 41:22.771
Mike? Mike? Can you breathe?

41:22.855 --> 41:23.814
Get out of here.

41:23.898 --> 41:24.773
Jesus, Mike.

41:25.357 --> 41:27.151
- Go.
- The fuck is going on?

41:27.234 --> 41:28.611
Hey, talk to me!

41:29.653 --> 41:30.529
Fuck.

41:39.079 --> 41:41.373
I'm gonna bump his O2
to 15 liters per minute.

41:41.457 --> 41:42.791
Pulse weak and thready.

41:42.875 --> 41:45.502
Patient is unresponsive,
has a GCS of 3.

41:45.586 --> 41:47.630
We'll take it from here, miss.

41:47.713 --> 41:49.298
Call San Fran General.

41:49.381 --> 41:52.218
Let them know we have an unconscious male
coming over. Priority 1.

42:17.409 --> 42:20.204
<i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>Queller residence.</i>

42:20.287 --> 42:22.998
Uh, can I speak with
Andrea Oliver, please?

42:23.082 --> 42:24.500
I believe she's staying with you.

42:24.583 --> 42:26.168
May I ask who's calling?

42:26.252 --> 42:27.169
Her mother.

42:29.505 --> 42:30.506
I'm sorry.

42:32.424 --> 42:33.801
Andrea has left.

42:35.344 --> 42:36.428
Uh…

42:37.471 --> 42:38.764
Where did she go?

42:40.391 --> 42:41.558
<i>I couldn't say.</i>

42:41.642 --> 42:43.894
Well, is everything all right?

42:44.520 --> 42:46.480
You would know better than I.

42:48.649 --> 42:51.443
If she comes back,
can you please ask her to call me?

42:51.527 --> 42:52.945
She has my number.

42:53.028 --> 42:53.904
<i>Of course.</i>

42:59.118 --> 43:00.995
It's good to hear your voice again.

43:01.996 --> 43:03.831
You have a beautiful daughter.

43:07.042 --> 43:10.045
I was so glad to meet her.

43:16.969 --> 43:17.803
Thank you.

43:20.514 --> 43:22.141
Take care of yourself.

43:22.224 --> 43:23.225
<i>You, too.</i>

43:31.191 --> 43:32.776
<i>What would I do without you?</i>

43:33.485 --> 43:35.446
You'd be just fine.

43:35.529 --> 43:37.031
I think I'd go crazy.

43:39.074 --> 43:41.368
- I hate Dad's parties.
- Don't say that.

43:41.452 --> 43:42.911
Mom hated them, too.

43:45.039 --> 43:47.916
She would have liked Nick,
don't you think?

43:49.043 --> 43:50.669
I miss him all the time.

43:51.337 --> 43:52.546
That's all over now.

44:10.522 --> 44:11.523
Jane.

44:13.859 --> 44:14.943
Don't move.

44:34.963 --> 44:35.881
There.

44:36.465 --> 44:37.841
I knew it would be perfect.

44:39.301 --> 44:40.636
This was Mom's.

44:41.303 --> 44:45.224
I was thinking,
since you are less distracted now,

44:45.307 --> 44:47.267
we can add a few performances to the tour.

44:47.351 --> 44:48.852
London. Geneva.

44:48.936 --> 44:50.396
Spend the summer together.

44:52.189 --> 44:54.775
I have social work in Berlin through July.

44:54.858 --> 44:56.068
You'll cancel that.

44:58.362 --> 44:59.780
It'll be fun.

44:59.863 --> 45:01.573
We don't need anyone else, do we?

46:39.588 --> 46:40.839
That was beautiful.

46:41.632 --> 46:45.093
This is all I want. Nights like this.

48:46.298 --> 48:48.467
The choice you've made isn't easy.

48:50.218 --> 48:52.304
The people we're fighting are powerful.

48:53.388 --> 48:55.724
They run corporations.
They run the government.

48:57.684 --> 49:02.272
They profit from racism, homophobia,
fear, the war on drugs.

49:03.190 --> 49:06.568
With that in mind, it's important to know
this is not just rhetoric.

49:06.652 --> 49:07.903
- Right.
- Yeah.

49:07.986 --> 49:08.946
Mm-hmm.

49:09.988 --> 49:13.533
When you fight back, you want to be clear
who you're doing it for. So--

49:16.411 --> 49:18.747
Everyone, Jane has come back to us.

49:20.332 --> 49:21.959
I'm sure she has a lot to share.

49:23.168 --> 49:25.295
But, first, we have a guest.

49:26.338 --> 49:27.839
Jane, this is Grace Juno.

49:28.423 --> 49:31.134
I asked Grace to come by,
tell us her story.

49:32.469 --> 49:35.389
Her husband and three children are dead.

49:37.140 --> 49:39.518
The man responsible is your father.

49:46.650 --> 49:47.984
We could use your help.
