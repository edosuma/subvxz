01:26.670 --> 01:30.757
Now at this point you
bring the music up, up...

01:30.841 --> 01:33.385
up, up, up to a crescendo.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.219
Up.

01:35.304 --> 01:38.432
There now. This is where
i make my entrance.

01:38.515 --> 01:42.018
Now, from here on, pianissimo,
keep it under while I talk.

01:42.102 --> 01:46.439
Softly, softly, softly. That's right.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.566
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:48.650 --> 01:52.195
magic is the science of illusion,
the art of misdirecting thought.

01:52.279 --> 01:55.865
<i>So if you will try and keep your thoughts
on what I am doing, l'll...</i>

01:55.949 --> 01:57.533
There. That's fine, fine.

01:57.618 --> 02:01.163
Sorry, sir. They're rehearsing inside.
No visitors.

02:01.246 --> 02:04.415
But this is something special.
I have a lady friend in the show.

02:04.499 --> 02:05.833
No smoking.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.336
Oh, I'm sorry. I promised her
I'd be here for the opening

02:08.419 --> 02:12.215
- miss Karen Lee?
- Miss Lee? Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:12.299 --> 02:16.594
The little one with the legs.
Don't tell me you've never noticed them.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.722
She's cute. Miss Lee!

02:19.806 --> 02:23.476
Miss Lee. A gentleman to see you.

02:25.103 --> 02:28.856
Alan. You got here after all.

02:31.526 --> 02:34.195
You didn't think I'd miss your opening.
How's it going?

02:34.279 --> 02:36.239
Like they always go with a new show.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.824
Oh, I want you to meet Mr. gallico.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.784
No, no, look,
i don't want to bother him now.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.035
<i>Oh, it'll do him good.</i>

02:41.119 --> 02:43.913
Make him forget his nervousness.
You'll like him.

02:53.215 --> 02:56.843
Gus. Be sure that entrance is kept clear
for the buzz saw trick.

02:56.927 --> 03:00.096
- Remember, it's got to be rolled
on in the dark. - Mr. gallico?

03:00.180 --> 03:02.617
I'd like you to meet lieutenant Bruce
of the New York detective bureau.

03:02.641 --> 03:05.602
- How are you? - He came all the way
from New York to see our opening show.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.522
I can see how busy you are,
all this excitement.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.065
Yes. Lt's especially exciting
for me, lieutenant,

03:11.149 --> 03:13.693
since this is my first appearance
on any stage.

03:13.777 --> 03:17.447
But Mr. gallico knows more about magic
than all the other magicians put together.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.450
For years I've been inventing illusions
for big-name magicians

03:20.534 --> 03:22.911
and watching them take all the bows.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.371
Well, I finally caught the fever myself.

03:25.455 --> 03:29.000
L'm like the playwright who wants
to get in there and read his own lines.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.377
- I guess I'm just a ham at heart.
- Who isn't?

03:31.461 --> 03:33.439
So I put this show together,
and if our luck holds out,

03:33.463 --> 03:35.131
we're headed for Broadway.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.425
Pardon me, please.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.779
Mr. gallico, we're ready to rehearse
the buzz saw illusion.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.739
L've sent out everybody
who doesn't have a part in it.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.033
Good. Pull that curtain down,
and be sure the stage door is kept locked.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.058
Right.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.060
That trick is
the secret of our show.

03:47.144 --> 03:51.606
You see, lieutenant, no magician considers
it a crime to steal from a competitor,

03:51.690 --> 03:54.776
so we carefully guard all our new ideas.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.362
This buzz saw trick of mine
is a prize shocker,

03:57.446 --> 03:58.989
and I'm taking no chances.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.990
We don't even trust the police.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.844
She doesn't mean you, lieutenant.
You don't have to go.

04:02.868 --> 04:06.079
I think I'd better. I'll be rooting
for you tonight. Good luck.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.581
Thanks so much.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.166
All right, now be sure
that stage door is locked.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.877
All right.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.132
This trick can put us over on Broadway.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.343
It all depends on how it's done.

04:20.427 --> 04:24.806
- L've made it as foolproof as possible,
but that saw is dangerous. -

04:24.890 --> 04:27.517
it can rip its way through
anything short of steel.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.979
All right, boys, take it from where
we place Karen on the table.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.685
Excuse me, Mr.-

05:12.938 --> 05:15.523
I didn't recognize you, Mr. gallico.

05:15.607 --> 05:18.943
Is it really that good?
Do I look like Rinaldi?

05:19.736 --> 05:21.863
Like his twin.

05:21.947 --> 05:25.408
I don't know. This is the first time
any magician has ever attempted

05:25.492 --> 05:28.328
an impersonation of one of his rivals.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.931
Holy smoke! That's the end of their act.
Mr. gallico, you're on.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.873
L'm ready.

05:38.505 --> 05:42.175
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. gallico, who is a talented mimic,

05:42.259 --> 05:44.344
will now present several
of his own illusions

05:44.427 --> 05:46.846
as they would be done
by other famous magicians.

05:46.930 --> 05:50.266
First, the great Rinaldi.

06:01.528 --> 06:06.028
Ah, how cooling it is.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.952
This is one convenience
we do not have in my place.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.288
Let us have some more, please.

06:17.210 --> 06:21.130
He not only looks like Rinaldi,
but he sounds like him.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.346
Was I all right?

07:51.429 --> 07:53.514
You were great. Just listen
to them. They loved you.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.350
- Did I sound like Rinaldi?
- Exactly like him.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.194
All right, Karen,
the buzz saw trick is next.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.938
Now, remember, that trick is
the high spot of our show.

08:01.022 --> 08:05.401
- If it's a hit, we're in. If it's a flop,
we're dead. Good luck. - Good luck.

08:20.375 --> 08:24.712
Ladies and gentlemen,
first, a demonstration.

08:29.467 --> 08:33.053
I have here a common newel post,

08:33.138 --> 08:36.182
cut from a solid piece
of mahogany.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.808
Hey. Where are you going?

08:37.892 --> 08:41.227
- L'm Ross ormond.
- Shh. There's a show going on.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.438
L'm Ross ormond.
I want to talk to the house manager.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.857
Well, he's out front.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.501
They said he was back here on the stage.
This is police business.

08:47.569 --> 08:51.656
<i>Oh, all right. L'll see if I can find him.
Wait down there.</i>

08:51.740 --> 08:53.032
Wait down there.

08:54.826 --> 08:59.326
Now, let us assume
that this is a human body,

08:59.789 --> 09:03.042
and that this is a human head.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.970
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:56.054 --> 09:59.807
this is the most dangerous
exhibition ever attempted,

09:59.891 --> 10:02.727
and I must ask
for complete silence.

10:02.811 --> 10:07.311
The least disturbance could cause
this experiment to end in tragedy.

10:08.149 --> 10:12.027
So now, I present
for the first time on any stage,

10:12.112 --> 10:15.615
“the lady and the buzz saw.”

10:23.123 --> 10:26.376
- who pulled the curtain down?
- Get that curtain up again. Up.

10:27.293 --> 10:30.421
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

10:30.505 --> 10:34.008
I wish to announce that owing
to unforeseen circumstances,

10:34.092 --> 10:36.803
we are unable to continue
with this performance.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.430
What does he mean “unable to continue”?

10:39.514 --> 10:41.891
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.285
What were you
talking about out there?

10:43.309 --> 10:45.185
How dare you pull down on me.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.729
Ask those men.
They'll tell you.

10:46.813 --> 10:50.399
And I'm holding you responsible
for the loss on tonight's business.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.027
L'm calling my lawyer right now.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.862
What does he mean, “ask you”?

10:54.946 --> 10:58.199
He means I rang down the curtain,
with an injunction.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.742
An injunction against what?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.327
The use of the buzz saw trick.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.663
But what right have you to...

11:03.746 --> 11:05.683
Lieutenant, do you know anything
about these things?

11:05.707 --> 11:08.376
A little, yeah,
but I'm no lawyer.

11:10.295 --> 11:12.880
This theater is enjoined
against showing your buzz saw trick.

11:12.964 --> 11:16.592
L'm afraid they've got you.
What's it all about?

11:16.676 --> 11:17.987
Well, if it's any of your business,

11:18.011 --> 11:20.346
I own a company
that builds illusions for magicians,

11:20.430 --> 11:22.348
and gallico is my employee.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.809
Anything he creates
becomes my property.

11:24.893 --> 11:28.396
But I built the buzz saw trick
on my own time and with my own money.

11:28.479 --> 11:31.899
Read your contract. No matter
how you built it, it still belongs to me.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.401
Why you rotten, low-down...

11:33.484 --> 11:36.069
No, Mr. gallico,
that won't get you anywhere.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.406
It'll get him locked up
in the cityjail.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.159
Now, listen, you.

11:41.242 --> 11:44.787
I want this trick back in my
New York studio before noon tomorrow.

11:44.871 --> 11:48.350
And if you know what's good for you, you'll
quit playing actor and get back on your job.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.168
Do you think
I'd work for you after this?

11:51.252 --> 11:54.338
You'll work for me, or you won't work.

11:54.422 --> 11:57.842
So long, gallico the great.

12:11.606 --> 12:14.734
This is a tough contract
you signed with ormond.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.985
Is it true that he owns
everything I create?

12:17.070 --> 12:20.823
According to this,
everything but the air you breathe.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.368
Can the contract be broken?

12:24.452 --> 12:26.620
I doubt it.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.957
But I told him at the time
that I would take care of this business

12:30.041 --> 12:32.585
as long as my show was in New York, or...

12:32.669 --> 12:35.797
or until he could replace me,
and he offered no objections.

12:35.880 --> 12:40.380
But that's his way, to say nothing
and then stab you in the back.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.100
L'm sorry. I...

12:49.477 --> 12:52.521
I don't often forget myself like that.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.191
I understand ormond's
a big man in show business.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.277
Yes.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.780
I had my show all set
for the 44th street theater.

13:01.864 --> 13:06.364
They told me this morning
that they'd booked another attraction.

13:06.577 --> 13:09.329
I can thank him for that.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.291
L'm afraid I have to go.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.377
I thought Karen was meeting you here.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.044
She's supposed to, but she's late.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.172
I have an appointment
at the Hudson university lab.

13:18.256 --> 13:21.384
They're doing some pathological work
for the department.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.801
Make my excuses, will you?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.094
Of course.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.596
Hi, don.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.973
Hello. You've met Mr. ormond.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.767
- Yes.
- Lieutenant.

13:29.851 --> 13:33.855
And I'm sure you've heard
of Mr. Rinaldi, the great Rinaldi?

13:33.938 --> 13:36.273
Master of the black arts.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.735
Magician by royal appointment
to the court of the king of Spain.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.530
L'm sorry. That's his billing.
Next week, Jersey city.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.906
Meet lieutenant Bruce,
of the detective bureau.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.410
A detective. Lt's a pleasure.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.037
I trust it remains a pleasure.

13:50.121 --> 13:52.206
L'm glad to know you,
Mr. Rinaldi.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.417
<i>- Excuse me. I was just leaving.
- L'll tell Karen.</i>

13:54.500 --> 13:58.295
Please, and tell her I'll meet her
for dinner at Tony's restaurant, 6:00.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.255
- So long.
- Thanks.

14:01.716 --> 14:05.302
Ah. The mysterious buzz saw.

14:07.180 --> 14:11.680
It looks very real, very dangerous.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.978
It's no wonder you kept it a secret.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.355
Go ahead, don.
Show him how it works.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.774
He's a magician.
He should know how it works.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.196
The girl's body drops through the trap.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.908
Then, when you pretend to fix her hair,
the dummy head comes up,

14:27.992 --> 14:29.868
and the real girl
slips out of the machine.

14:29.952 --> 14:34.452
Very good. But it needs a showman
to present it to an audience.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.251
It was presumptuous of you
to think you could do it.

14:37.335 --> 14:40.504
Only an amateur could be so brash.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.424
But I'll make you famous, my pet.

14:43.508 --> 14:47.094
In my hands you'll become a star.

14:47.178 --> 14:51.390
Now, look, I'll send a moving Van to pick
it up this afternoon and deliver it to me.

14:51.474 --> 14:55.352
L'm bringing my show
to the 44th street theater next month,

14:55.436 --> 14:57.604
and I want to start rehearsing this trick.

14:57.688 --> 15:01.191
I'll give it top billing
on all my posters.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.111
The 44th street theater.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.613
Of course.

15:05.696 --> 15:08.782
Ross owns half interest in my show.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.661
Well, I have a matinee in Jersey city.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.371
- Good-bye, Ross.
- Good-bye.

15:14.455 --> 15:17.749
Good-bye, gallico the great.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.093
So that's why you took
the trick away from me.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.197
I could have stopped you
before you booked your first date.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.223
But why didn't you?
Why did you let me go on?

15:32.306 --> 15:35.809
You needed a lesson.
You belong here, not in the theater.

15:35.893 --> 15:39.980
When I stumbled onto you, you were a two-bit
concessionaire with a broken-down carny outfit.

15:40.064 --> 15:43.400
All you had was a leaky tent
and a bag full of cheap tricks.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.028
I had a lovely wife.

15:46.112 --> 15:49.073
She was the only reason I took a
second look at your flea-bitten show.

15:49.157 --> 15:53.035
The only reason you brought me here
and gave me a job.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.538
She was a lot different then.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.457
For one thing, she had an innocent mind.

15:58.541 --> 16:02.670
But to you, that meant ignorance,
and so you did your best to change it.

16:02.753 --> 16:06.965
She had one great weakness,
a consuming hunger for rich living,

16:07.049 --> 16:09.301
and I couldn't give her that.

16:09.385 --> 16:13.885
If you'd left us alone,
she might have gotten over it,

16:13.973 --> 16:16.809
but you catered to it, built it up.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.520
I could see her change
before my eyes.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.190
It was no surprise
when she asked me for a divorce.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.025
You seemed willing enough.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.902
She didn't try to deceive me.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.530
She told me what she wanted,
and I let her have her way.

16:29.614 --> 16:33.701
It couldn't have bothered you much, or
you wouldn't have stayed here onthejob.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.787
I loved her, Ross.

16:37.455 --> 16:40.124
Oh, yeah.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.293
That's funny, isn't it?

16:43.294 --> 16:45.421
Yes, it would be, to you.

16:46.214 --> 16:49.842
I knew you, even then.
I knew what could happen.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.969
I stayed on the job to pick up the pieces.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.305
You're lucky
i took her off your hands.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.188
Look how she's behaved
since I've married her.

16:56.265 --> 16:59.059
Gallivanting all over Europe,
spending my money like water.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.478
I haven't seen her in six months.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.272
“Didn't try to deceive you”?

17:04.357 --> 17:07.609
You stupid fool.
She's always been a trollop.

17:07.693 --> 17:11.780
She double-crossed you from the first,
just as she double-crossed me.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.743
Don. don, what's the matter with you?
Keep away from me.

17:16.827 --> 17:19.538
You took everything.
Everything I ever had.

17:19.622 --> 17:23.626
My wife! My brains! My self-respect!

17:23.709 --> 17:26.169
Everything but the air I breathe.

17:26.253 --> 17:30.299
“Gallico the great, magician
extraordinary.” that's funny, isn't it?

17:30.383 --> 17:34.345
Gallico the clown.
Gallico the stupid fool.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.513
There's one trick
you've never seen, Ross.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.933
That no magician has ever dared to try.
But I can't do it alone.

17:40.017 --> 17:43.145
You've got to help me.
In fact, you'll be the star.

17:43.229 --> 17:47.149
- don. Stop it! Don't! - Gallico the
great, the magician extraordinary.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.860
- Why don't you laugh at me now?
- Don, the blade.

17:49.944 --> 17:51.862
- Go on! Laugh!
- Don, the blade!

17:51.946 --> 17:53.405
Laugh! Laugh!

17:54.657 --> 17:56.492
Go on! Laugh!

17:58.619 --> 17:59.703
You crazy murderer.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.748
- Laugh! Laugh!
- Murderer! The blade!

18:02.832 --> 18:04.708
- Laugh! Laugh!
- Don, the blade!

18:04.792 --> 18:07.002
"Lau9h! Laugh!
- don! don!

18:07.086 --> 18:09.588
Laugh! Laugh!

18:09.672 --> 18:11.173
Laugh!

18:30.026 --> 18:31.485
Who is it?

18:31.569 --> 18:32.695
It's Karen.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.946
One moment, please.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.965
Hello, don. Ls Alan here?

18:54.050 --> 18:56.343
No. He couldn't wait.
He had an appointment.

18:56.427 --> 18:59.471
Oh, dear. I know I'm late,
but I couldn't help it.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.975
I got a job today,
working at Siegel-Cooper's store.

19:03.059 --> 19:07.271
Oh. Alan said he would meet you
at Tony's restaurant at 6:00.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.398
It's almost that now.

19:09.482 --> 19:13.982
Karen, I want to make you out a check
for the time you spent in rehearsal

19:14.695 --> 19:16.655
and two weeks' salary in addition.

19:16.739 --> 19:19.825
Oh, well, forget it, don.
I know what this thing has cost you.

19:19.909 --> 19:23.996
No, I want you to have your money,
the same as the others.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.124
If there's any change in my plans,
I'll let you know.

19:27.208 --> 19:30.211
Look, don, why don't you
come to dinner with us tonight?

19:30.294 --> 19:31.586
It'll do you good.

19:31.671 --> 19:35.007
No, thanks, Karen,
but I have something else to do.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.427
Good night, Karen.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.346
Good night, don.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.973
Illusions, incorporated.

19:43.057 --> 19:46.477
Yes, this is Mr. gallico.
Who is this, please?

19:46.560 --> 19:48.728
Dean's Van and storage?

19:49.522 --> 19:54.022
Yes, I have a consignment for Mr. Rinaldi.
I'll be here tonight.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.487
I'll have it ready for you.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.706
Karen.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.791
- Hello there.
- Hello.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.918
Don, you changed your mind.

20:53.002 --> 20:56.296
Karen, you left your bag at the studio
and took mine by mistake.

20:56.380 --> 21:00.008
There's something in my bag
that's very, very valuable. Where is it?

21:02.678 --> 21:04.304
Oh. don, I...

21:04.388 --> 21:06.723
What's the matter?
What have you done with it?

21:06.807 --> 21:09.142
I left it in the cab.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.393
In a cab?

21:11.645 --> 21:13.104
Do you remember the driver?

21:13.189 --> 21:15.691
No, it was just a hansom cab.

21:15.775 --> 21:19.069
It's all right. The driver
will turn it over to the police.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.366
Waiter, bring my check.

21:27.870 --> 21:30.622
- Did you bring a young lady
to this restaurant? - Nope.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.250
- How long have you been here?
- About a quarter of an hour.

21:33.334 --> 21:35.711
Did you see a hansom cab
leave a young woman here?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.087
Nope.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.674
- Did you?
- Nope.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.551
I did.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.347
- That was ed Burke's rig.
- Where did Burke go?

21:46.430 --> 21:48.325
He picked up a couple who wanted
to take a turn through the park.

21:48.349 --> 21:51.352
- Go after him. If you find him,
I'll double that. - Yes, sir.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.566
Let's go.

22:05.491 --> 22:08.327
Hey! Ed! Pull up a minute.

22:08.410 --> 22:11.287
Whoa.

22:11.372 --> 22:14.750
Are you the driver who dropped this
young lady in Tony's restaurant?

22:14.834 --> 22:18.379
- Yep.
- She left a black leather bag in your cab.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.006
- She sure did.
- Well, that bag belongs to me.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.675
There's nothing to worry about, mister.
I gave it to a cop.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.179
- You gave it to a cop?
- Yeah, a cop.

22:27.263 --> 22:31.350
The cop at the kiosk, back at Van
cortlandt drive and Fordham road.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.810
He'll turn it in at his station.

22:33.894 --> 22:34.769
That's what he said.

22:34.854 --> 22:35.980
Giddap.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.775
Fordham and Van cortlandt.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.360
Yes, sir.

24:03.901 --> 24:05.777
- Hello, don.
- Hello, Karen.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.905
I saw your lights from the street.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.951
Oh, are you going
to the victory celebration?

24:13.035 --> 24:14.036
Victory celebration?

24:14.119 --> 24:17.747
Yes. Hudson won from parnell,

24:17.831 --> 24:22.126
and there'll be some sort of hijinks
on the campus tonight.

24:22.211 --> 24:26.711
You know, some kind of a bonfire
and a snake dance.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.675
That's not for me, Karen.

24:28.759 --> 24:30.385
Here, sit down.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.809
I hope you've forgiven me
for carrying off your bag.

24:37.893 --> 24:41.313
- You did no harm.
- It was stupid of me.

24:41.397 --> 24:45.897
But I couldn't understand why you let the
policeman think that my bag was yours?

24:47.736 --> 24:49.320
You couldn't?

24:49.405 --> 24:52.574
Well, Alan was curious, too.
You know how detectives are.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.743
He questioned me after you left us.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.496
Oh? Well, what about?

24:57.579 --> 25:01.165
Why you were so excited.
You were, you know.

25:02.042 --> 25:05.420
It was all my fault. I've been so worried.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.381
What was in that bag, don?

25:09.133 --> 25:11.927
Do you really want to know, Karen?

25:12.011 --> 25:13.387
It was a head.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.430
A human head.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.308
You're just making fun of me.

25:18.392 --> 25:21.228
Not at all. It was your head, Karen.

25:21.311 --> 25:24.439
The dummy-head I made
for the buzz saw trick.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.943
Do you remember how its eyes rolled
and the mouth opened in a scream

25:28.027 --> 25:31.196
when the teeth of the saw
ripped into its flesh?

25:31.280 --> 25:33.573
That was the most
lifelike thing I ever made.

25:33.657 --> 25:37.410
Do you think I'm going to let Rinaldi
take that away from me, too?

25:37.494 --> 25:39.120
Oh, no, my dear.

25:39.204 --> 25:42.290
<i>He'll never find
that lovely head of yours.</i>

25:43.792 --> 25:48.292
Well. I'm glad it was nothing
more serious than that.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.757
Oh, Karen.

25:50.841 --> 25:54.761
That celebration tonight,
do they build a big bonfire?

25:54.845 --> 25:57.764
Oh, a tremendous one.
Everybody brings fuel for it.

25:57.848 --> 25:59.683
It's terribly exciting.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.351
Yes, I'm sure it must be.

26:01.435 --> 26:04.396
Well, good night, Karen.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.106
Good night, don.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.873
All right, boys, light it.

27:46.957 --> 27:49.668
Toll the bell, here's parnell!

27:49.751 --> 27:52.628
Dead as a doornail, dead as a post!

27:52.713 --> 27:54.715
Dead on the vine, dead in the shell!

27:54.798 --> 27:57.884
Poor parnell, well, well, well!

27:57.968 --> 28:00.637
Toll the bell, here's parnell!

28:00.721 --> 28:03.557
Dead as a doornail, dead as a post!

28:03.640 --> 28:06.351
Dead on the vine, dead in the shell!

28:06.435 --> 28:09.229
Poor parnell, well, well, well!

28:09.313 --> 28:11.857
Toll the bell, here's parnell!

28:11.940 --> 28:13.775
Dead as a doornail...

28:13.859 --> 28:17.612
Mr. ormond.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.948
I thought I recognized you.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.242
Don't you remember me?

28:22.326 --> 28:25.746
Oh, of course. Hello, miss Lee.

28:31.835 --> 28:36.214
Bones found on college campus!
Get your extra here!

28:40.969 --> 28:43.096
Oh, extraordinary, isn't it?

28:43.180 --> 28:46.057
- About these bones they found.
- I beg your pardon?

28:46.141 --> 28:48.560
Well, the other night,
after the Hudson-parnell game,

28:48.644 --> 28:51.355
they were having a celebration
on the campus.

28:51.438 --> 28:54.065
A huge bonfire and, well,
that sort of thing, you know.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.316
Yes.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.569
Well, what do you think they found
in the ashes the next morning?

28:58.654 --> 29:02.157
- I have no idea.
- Two human shin bones and part of a spine.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.451
- Not really.
- Oh, yes, indeed.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.327
I don't know what we're coming to.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.663
- Do you have some rooms to rent?
- Hmm?

29:08.747 --> 29:12.459
Well, I read this advertisement
in the morning paper...

29:12.542 --> 29:14.835
This is your advertisement?

29:14.920 --> 29:18.048
Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Do come in.

29:21.385 --> 29:23.053
Alice!

29:23.136 --> 29:25.513
We don't make a regular thing
of renting rooms,

29:25.597 --> 29:29.225
but you see, my wife's mother
occupied the top floor and...

29:29.309 --> 29:33.229
Well, she's gone on to her reward,
and so we have that space on our hands.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.356
- Yes, frank?
- Hmm?

29:35.440 --> 29:39.735
Oh, oh, this gentleman came to see
about the room you advertised.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.571
- Mr., uh...
- Jameson. Ward Jameson.

29:41.655 --> 29:43.615
Yes. Mrs. prentiss, my wife.

29:43.699 --> 29:47.911
Oh, yes. Lt's a pleasure, Mr. Jameson.
I'll show you the rooms if you like.

29:47.995 --> 29:51.957
Well, do watch the stairs.
There's no light on the upper landing.

30:04.094 --> 30:05.762
Here we are.

30:12.769 --> 30:17.023
This is the sitting room. The bedroom
is in here, with a bath beyond.

30:17.107 --> 30:20.401
Oh, I'm sure you'll be comfortable,
and very quiet here.

30:20.485 --> 30:21.652
That's what I'm looking for.

30:21.737 --> 30:25.490
And my husband goes to business,
and I'm always busy in my study.

30:25.574 --> 30:26.700
I write, you know.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.701
- You do?
- Yes. Alice prentiss.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.078
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

30:31.163 --> 30:35.292
You see, I need a place where I can study
and do some experimental work.

30:35.375 --> 30:38.628
L'm afraid my habits are not those
of the regular businessman.

30:38.712 --> 30:42.298
L'm apt to return late at night,
and I may not be here for days at a time.

30:42.382 --> 30:43.674
Oh, that's quite all right.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.178
Would you mind if I moved in right now?

30:46.261 --> 30:47.845
I have everything I need.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.615
But I haven't told you
what I want for the rooms.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.474
Anything you say.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.870
Well, let me see. With maid services
and everything, I had thought...

30:53.894 --> 30:55.770
- Fifty a month?
- Fifty a month?

30:55.854 --> 30:57.397
In advance, of course.

30:57.481 --> 30:59.024
Oh, that's very good of you.

30:59.107 --> 31:02.026
You've no idea what a relief it is
to find just the place I need,

31:02.110 --> 31:05.404
where I can come and go as I please
and be left alone.

31:05.489 --> 31:08.658
People are always so determined
to poke into your business.

31:08.742 --> 31:10.910
I could see at once
that you're not that kind.

31:10.994 --> 31:13.579
Oh, no, no, indeed.
Uh, I'll get you a receipt.

31:13.663 --> 31:14.789
Anytime at all.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.125
Well, it looks
like the deal is closed.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.294
Everything is satisfactory, frank.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.755
Oh, Mr. Jameson,
have you had supper?

31:21.838 --> 31:23.158
- No, but I...
- L'll get you some.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.257
Oh, please don't bother.

31:24.341 --> 31:26.181
It's no bother.
I'll have the maid bring it up.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.802
Thank you.

31:27.886 --> 31:28.887
Charming woman.

31:28.970 --> 31:32.181
Oh, yes, yes. I say, did Alice
tell you that she writes?

31:32.265 --> 31:33.391
Yes, she did.

31:33.475 --> 31:35.560
Murder mysteries. Oh, she's full of plots.

31:35.644 --> 31:38.855
Morning, noon and night. That's all
i ever hear. Plots, plots, plots.

31:38.939 --> 31:43.439
Oh, oh, I say, here.
Here's her latest, murder is a must'.

31:43.860 --> 31:46.529
- Rather good title, don't you think?
- Very good.

31:46.613 --> 31:50.491
- Yes, it sold over a hundred thousand
copies. - Vvhat does it mean?

31:50.575 --> 31:54.745
Well, it's about a chap who murders a
chap, and then, so not to be found out,

31:54.830 --> 31:57.791
he has to kill another one
and then another one,

31:57.874 --> 32:02.374
and, well, that's the way it goes,
ad infinitum, ad nauseam.

32:02.671 --> 32:07.171
However, it's rather cute
the way she dreams these things up.

32:07.342 --> 32:11.387
I say, Alice has a theory
that all murderers are crazy.

32:11.471 --> 32:12.847
So?

32:12.931 --> 32:15.141
Well, I don't know about that.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.810
Well, maybe we all have
a bit of it in us,

32:17.894 --> 32:22.106
and maybe if it wasn't for the law,
we'd all go round killing each other.

32:22.190 --> 32:25.776
I say, there's another good plot,
don't you think?

32:27.404 --> 32:30.573
Well, I do hope you like it here,
Mr. Jameson.

32:30.657 --> 32:32.617
Thank you.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.421
Hello, Claire.

33:28.173 --> 33:29.924
The village blacksmith.

33:32.135 --> 33:34.220
Mmm.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.806
Not bad.

33:36.890 --> 33:39.601
Absence makes
the heart beat faster.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.853
Are you glad to see me, darling?

33:43.855 --> 33:45.147
Very glad.

33:45.232 --> 33:47.609
Well, you don't show it.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.111
At least I would expect a compliment.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.156
You look terribly expensive.

33:53.240 --> 33:56.826
Now you sound
like my second husband.

33:58.745 --> 34:01.122
Shall we cheat him a little bit, darling?

34:01.206 --> 34:03.333
I don't think so.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.875
What's the matter?

34:04.960 --> 34:07.420
Don't you love me anymore?

34:07.504 --> 34:10.380
I'll always love what you were.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.632
But not what I am?

34:12.717 --> 34:15.428
Well, I think I'm rather nice.

34:15.512 --> 34:17.847
Lots of people do.

34:18.431 --> 34:20.224
What are you working on?

34:20.308 --> 34:21.891
A new trick.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.145
Is the studio making money?

34:24.228 --> 34:25.563
It's doing very well.

34:25.647 --> 34:28.650
Good. Good.

34:30.193 --> 34:32.945
I suppose you know that Ross has left me.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.362
Can you blame him?

34:34.447 --> 34:37.949
Yes, and so would you,
if you would react normally.

34:38.034 --> 34:41.036
Have you forgotten
that I was once your wife?

34:41.121 --> 34:42.996
L'm not likely to.

34:43.081 --> 34:47.581
Don, he's hiding from me.
I've got to find him.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.255
I'll get even for both of us.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.882
Tell me where he is.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.427
I don't know.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.554
You don't know.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.266
You're afraid of him.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.935
Yes, I think you are.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.688
You know...

35:07.731 --> 35:12.152
You know, I often wondered
why you let him make a fool of you

35:12.235 --> 35:14.111
and turned the other cheek.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.864
Perhaps you knew all the time
what was going on

35:16.948 --> 35:19.283
and didn't have the courage
to do anything about it.

35:21.661 --> 35:22.953
Don.

35:24.247 --> 35:28.042
- What's happened to you?
- I didn't want to do that, Claire.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.963
Now, you'd better get out of here.

35:53.985 --> 35:57.488
But I read in the paper where Mrs.
Ross ormond had returned from Europe

35:57.572 --> 35:59.407
and found that her husband was missing.

35:59.491 --> 36:03.991
I said to myself, “oh, you poor little
creature, if only I could help you.”

36:04.871 --> 36:07.331
Mrs. prentiss loves to help people.

36:07.415 --> 36:11.001
And turned the other cheek.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.629
It was rather smudgy.

36:12.712 --> 36:16.882
No, thank you.
It was a rather smudgy happiness.

36:16.966 --> 36:21.053
And then, Mr. ormond was wearing
his whiskers in a different style,

36:21.137 --> 36:24.515
but there was something
about that face that rang a bell.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.518
She... she... she studied it
under a microscope.

36:27.602 --> 36:31.188
It was then that I determined
to write to you and ask you to come here.

36:31.272 --> 36:35.772
Oh, of course, this roomer may not be your
husband, but it's well worth investigating.

36:36.736 --> 36:38.320
What name did he use?

36:38.405 --> 36:39.864
Ward Jameson.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.240
What did he look like?

36:41.324 --> 36:44.493
Oh, he's a very striking man.

36:44.577 --> 36:48.914
The moment I laid eyes on him,
i said, “there's a character.”

36:48.998 --> 36:52.251
I collect characters.
I'm a writer, you know.

36:52.335 --> 36:54.587
- Murder mysteries.
- Alice prentiss.

36:54.671 --> 36:59.171
Oh. Here's a picture of my husband.
Lt's a much newer one.

37:00.218 --> 37:04.718
Frank. Frank, what did I tell you?
I knew it in my bones.

37:04.848 --> 37:06.224
Yes, my dear, in your bones.

37:06.307 --> 37:09.351
This is the man, Mrs. ormond.

37:09.436 --> 37:10.687
Is he here now?

37:10.770 --> 37:12.373
Oh, no, no.
He spends very little time here,

37:12.397 --> 37:15.733
but he did tell the maid
that he'd be in late tonight, very late.

37:16.609 --> 37:21.109
Oh, my dear, you... you do want
to make up with him, don't you?

37:21.281 --> 37:25.781
Why, of course. Lf only he'd let me.

37:25.869 --> 37:28.204
I don't think
that will be too difficult.

37:30.290 --> 37:31.332
Frank.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.418
Yes, dear?

37:33.501 --> 37:35.336
Oh, yes, my dear.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.381
Now, my dear child,

37:38.465 --> 37:42.965
I've handled situations like this
in dozens of my books,

37:43.261 --> 37:47.761
and they always turn out
in a very interesting way.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.642
Oh?

37:59.736 --> 38:01.446
- Frank.
- Huh? What?

38:01.529 --> 38:04.073
Shh. He's here.

39:11.641 --> 39:13.392
Ross.

39:13.476 --> 39:17.438
What is the matter?
Can't you speak?

39:17.522 --> 39:19.815
Or is the shock of seeing me
too much for you?

39:19.899 --> 39:21.609
What are you doing here?

39:21.693 --> 39:23.236
What am I doing here?

39:23.319 --> 39:25.529
Well, after all, I'm your wife.

39:25.613 --> 39:28.490
Where would I be
but with my husband?

39:28.575 --> 39:30.368
How did you find me?

39:30.451 --> 39:31.618
Well, that was easy.

39:31.703 --> 39:35.123
You shouldn't have rented rooms
from a woman who writes.

39:35.206 --> 39:38.083
You might have guessed
she'd be curious about you.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.793
Do the prentisses know you're here?

39:39.878 --> 39:43.089
Why, of course, my darling.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.718
Who are you?

39:48.720 --> 39:50.680
You're not Ross.

39:50.763 --> 39:53.307
You're don, aren't you?

39:55.727 --> 39:58.855
It's amazing. Incredible.

39:58.938 --> 40:01.899
I think it would fool
anybody in the world,

40:01.983 --> 40:04.235
with one exception.

40:04.319 --> 40:07.447
The woman who lived with both of you.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.573
Why are you masquerading like this?

40:09.657 --> 40:11.784
Are you trying to help him against me?

40:11.868 --> 40:13.578
Where is he?

40:13.661 --> 40:16.497
Well, don't stand there
staring at me. Answer me.

40:23.963 --> 40:25.673
He's dead.

40:25.757 --> 40:26.841
Yes.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.220
You killed him.

40:31.304 --> 40:32.346
Yes.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.183
Aren't they going to find him?

40:36.726 --> 40:38.769
I don't think so.

40:44.025 --> 40:47.820
It's all right, don.
You don't have to worry about me.

40:47.904 --> 40:49.864
I would never turn you in.

40:49.948 --> 40:52.617
Did you think that
i wanted him for myself?

40:52.700 --> 40:55.577
I wanted his money,
and now I've got it.

40:55.662 --> 40:59.374
You've made me a very rich woman, don,
and I could love you for it.

40:59.457 --> 41:03.957
I could love you all over again.

41:04.337 --> 41:08.799
Why, I know... I know
I've been rotten to you.

41:08.883 --> 41:12.887
I made a terrible mistake.
I'll make up for it.

41:13.888 --> 41:15.806
We could get married again.

41:15.890 --> 41:19.935
We could be happy.
We can buy anything we want.

41:22.021 --> 41:24.189
My poor, dear Claire.

41:24.273 --> 41:25.399
Don.

41:26.859 --> 41:30.946
Don't you know
i wouldn't dare trust you?

41:31.030 --> 41:32.865
No! No!

41:49.507 --> 41:52.134
Mr. ormond! Mr. ormond!

41:52.218 --> 41:53.469
Open the door!

41:53.970 --> 41:56.180
Frank! Frank, do something!

41:56.764 --> 41:58.140
Here. Here.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.745
Get the police.

42:19.829 --> 42:21.247
Yes, my dear.

42:30.923 --> 42:32.549
Thank you.

42:32.633 --> 42:36.553
Er... Mr. gallico...

42:36.637 --> 42:38.138
Mrs. ormond was your former wife.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.806
Yes, sir.

42:39.891 --> 42:43.561
Do you believe
ormond killed her?

42:43.644 --> 42:45.979
Apparently he was with her
when she died.

42:46.064 --> 42:50.564
Mr. prentiss, you'll testify to that?

42:50.693 --> 42:53.362
Oh, we have to, inspector.

42:53.446 --> 42:57.946
We heard their voices.
We heard her call him by his name: Ross.

42:59.285 --> 43:01.704
Why should he kill her? Tell me that.

43:01.788 --> 43:04.415
I think I can show you
that ormond convicted himself.

43:04.499 --> 43:06.959
Now, he's going to show you
his newfangled fingerprints.

43:07.043 --> 43:09.754
It was adopted officially
by the French, two years ago.

43:09.837 --> 43:13.298
No two sets of prints are alike.
Come here and I'll show you what I mean.

43:14.801 --> 43:18.054
Now, here's a print of the index
finger of ormond's right hand.

43:18.137 --> 43:19.680
Where did you get it?

43:19.764 --> 43:22.159
From articles ormond handled
while he was rooming with the prentisses.

43:22.183 --> 43:25.895
Now, here's a second print taken from another
source and blown up to the same size.

43:25.978 --> 43:30.478
You will notice that the prints
match each other, line for line.

43:30.566 --> 43:34.945
I found this print on the surface of a gold
bracelet that belonged to Mrs. ormond.

43:35.029 --> 43:36.822
I remember the bracelet.

43:36.906 --> 43:39.074
She was wearing it
the night she was killed.

43:39.158 --> 43:40.784
Well, we know the man we want.

43:40.868 --> 43:43.579
The job is to find him.
That'll be all, thank you.

43:43.663 --> 43:45.706
Oh, uh, don't leave town.

43:45.790 --> 43:49.293
We may call you anytime.
Good day, everybody.

43:49.377 --> 43:53.506
I suppose you found the same
fingerprints in ormond's house?

43:53.589 --> 43:56.466
Yes. In his own room.
Fresh ones, apparently.

43:56.551 --> 43:59.321
He must have made them the night he
packed a bag and moved into your house.

43:59.345 --> 44:03.098
Are you sure it was Ross ormond
you rented rooms to?

44:03.182 --> 44:04.641
I identified his photograph.

44:04.725 --> 44:09.104
Yes, but you could have been mistaken.
You are not infallible, madame.

44:09.188 --> 44:12.399
Now, if you'll excuse me,
i have an audience waiting for me.

44:12.483 --> 44:14.943
I hope they hiss him off the stage.

44:15.027 --> 44:16.945
Oh, Mr. gallico.

44:17.029 --> 44:19.364
Your work simply fascinates me.

44:19.448 --> 44:20.532
It's so unusual.

44:21.159 --> 44:23.828
I wonder if I could visit
your studio sometime.

44:23.911 --> 44:27.205
Why, of course. When I have
something interesting to show you,

44:27.290 --> 44:28.833
I'll get in touch with you.

44:28.916 --> 44:30.918
Oh, thank you so much.

44:31.002 --> 44:32.420
Good-bye.

44:33.171 --> 44:35.965
Alice. Alice. What are you up to?

44:36.048 --> 44:38.050
Oh, nothing, my dear.
Nothing at all.

44:38.134 --> 44:41.345
He's an odd character.
I may put him in a book.

44:42.763 --> 44:44.890
Besides,

44:44.974 --> 44:49.474
I have the strangest feeling
that I've known him before.

44:50.771 --> 44:55.271
Hello. Mr. prentiss? Oh, this is gallico.

44:55.610 --> 45:00.110
Tomorrow morning at 11:00 I'm staging
a sort of dress rehearsal in my studio

45:00.281 --> 45:02.032
of a new trick I've been building,

45:02.116 --> 45:03.992
and remembering your wife's request,

45:04.076 --> 45:05.786
<i>I'm inviting you
both to be present.</i>

45:05.870 --> 45:07.288
<i>Can you come?</i>

45:07.371 --> 45:11.541
Well, Mrs. prentiss isn't here at the
moment, but I'm sure I can speak for her.

45:11.626 --> 45:13.294
Almost sure.

45:13.377 --> 45:16.880
Uh, we'd be delighted,
Mr. gallico. Delighted.

45:17.798 --> 45:20.175
This is the first private showing
of a new illusion

45:20.259 --> 45:22.761
I've built for my own use in the theater.

45:22.845 --> 45:25.764
Karen knows how it works,
and she's going to assist me.

45:25.848 --> 45:28.976
But for the most part,
the machine you will see is automatic.

45:29.060 --> 45:31.121
Until it is shown in the theater,
i must keep it a secret

45:31.145 --> 45:34.523
so that no other magician
can steal the idea.

45:34.607 --> 45:38.902
This audience had to be one I could trust,
and Karen suggested that I invite you.

45:38.986 --> 45:40.904
Oh, Mr. gallico, we're so flattered.

45:40.988 --> 45:42.781
Yes, this is quite an event.

45:42.865 --> 45:43.907
Sit down, please.

45:44.784 --> 45:47.953
Well, here we go.

45:57.588 --> 46:02.088
Gallico the great presents his sensational
new illusion, “the crematorium”.

46:13.854 --> 46:17.566
This device feeds the body,
which is to be destroyed,

46:17.650 --> 46:20.527
into the fire chamber of the crematorium.

46:20.611 --> 46:25.111
Once inside, it releases the body,
leaves it there, and then withdraws.

46:25.616 --> 46:27.534
But unless the machine is shut off,

46:27.618 --> 46:31.288
it automatically repeats the performance
within 40 seconds.

46:34.166 --> 46:38.666
Gas is the fuel, operating
under a forced draft of oxygen.

46:39.005 --> 46:42.049
It takes a few moments
for the heat to build up,

46:42.133 --> 46:43.676
but once it gets started,

46:43.759 --> 46:48.096
it develops a temperature
of 3500 degrees fahrenheit.

46:48.931 --> 46:51.475
All right, Karen. You take over.

47:46.030 --> 47:48.824
Well, how did you like it?

47:48.908 --> 47:52.995
Well clone, gallico. Well clone.

47:53.079 --> 47:55.915
- How did you get in here?
- Through the door.

47:55.998 --> 47:59.084
Then you knew
that I was showing this trick.

47:59.168 --> 48:02.045
Oh, yes. I have ways
of finding out what goes on.

48:02.129 --> 48:04.214
Can you blame me for being curious?

48:04.298 --> 48:08.051
Take it easy, gallico.
There's no harm done.

48:08.886 --> 48:11.346
We'll see about that.

48:11.430 --> 48:13.098
Did you like it?

48:13.182 --> 48:14.474
It was terribly exciting.

48:14.558 --> 48:16.017
Oh, but isn't it dangerous?

48:16.102 --> 48:18.789
Of course, I knew it wasn't you in there
while the burning was going on,

48:18.813 --> 48:21.899
but supposing your escape device
didn't work and you oouldn't get out?

48:21.982 --> 48:22.983
What then?

48:23.067 --> 48:25.778
The assistant controls
the magician's escape.

48:25.861 --> 48:28.071
She lets the boss out
just as the flame comes on.

48:28.155 --> 48:30.073
And what if she
doesn't like the boss?

48:30.157 --> 48:32.367
Ashes to ashes.

48:32.451 --> 48:36.121
This thing is more than an illusion.
It really works.

48:36.205 --> 48:38.957
Oh, it's... it's still hot.

48:39.041 --> 48:42.419
I say, where did you get the idea
for this crematorium?

48:42.503 --> 48:44.338
From a crematory.

48:44.422 --> 48:46.298
The heat principle is the same.

48:46.382 --> 48:48.425
It does more than burn. It disintegrates.

48:48.509 --> 48:51.303
Oh, thanks for inviting us.
It was a wonderful show.

48:51.387 --> 48:53.722
But we must be running along.

48:55.724 --> 49:00.224
Oh, by the way, have you gentlemen heard
anything new about our murder case?

49:00.771 --> 49:02.439
They're still hunting ormond.

49:02.523 --> 49:05.317
Do you know, I'm beginning
to believe that that man is dead.

49:05.401 --> 49:07.403
No one could disappear
so completely.

49:07.486 --> 49:09.362
Want to share a cab
with us, Karen?

49:09.447 --> 49:10.573
Yes, I'm coming.

49:12.366 --> 49:15.494
Oh, it was so sweet of you.

49:15.578 --> 49:17.246
Yes, thanks again.

49:18.747 --> 49:20.915
- Thank you, Karen.
- Good night.

49:29.049 --> 49:31.509
Not bad, gallico.

49:31.594 --> 49:33.721
Not bad at all.

49:38.350 --> 49:42.850
Of course, it needs work,
but I know you'll get the bugs out of it.

49:45.024 --> 49:48.193
Yeah, I'll have the lithograph people
send an artist over here

49:48.277 --> 49:51.405
to make me some sketches
for a new poster.

49:51.489 --> 49:55.576
“The great Rinaldi presents
his shocking new illusion...

49:55.659 --> 49:57.160
The crematorium!”

49:57.244 --> 50:01.744
save yourself the trouble.
You'll never get your hands on this one.

50:02.416 --> 50:04.668
Do you really think so?

50:05.503 --> 50:09.173
You know, gallico,
that prentiss woman is nobody's fool.

50:10.216 --> 50:12.551
I believe she came close
to the truth about ormond.

50:13.302 --> 50:16.596
If he were alive,
he'd need money.

50:17.765 --> 50:22.265
He wouldn't dare go to his bank,
nor would he go to you, I think.

50:22.728 --> 50:25.605
But he'd surely come to me.
I'm his partner.

50:26.524 --> 50:30.945
Not that he'd trust me particularly,
but he'd know I wouldn't turn him in.

50:32.279 --> 50:35.991
Because, you see,
he had a couple of things on me.

50:37.201 --> 50:40.954
Ross ormond was a cold,
calculating customer.

50:41.038 --> 50:44.124
He'd ditch a woman,
but he'd never kill her.

50:44.208 --> 50:46.043
No woman could mean
that much to him.

50:46.126 --> 50:50.463
He might kick her out of his house,
but he'd never move out himself.

50:51.840 --> 50:56.340
You see, I know these things
because I knew him.

50:56.595 --> 50:58.471
I knew Claire.

51:01.350 --> 51:03.352
I know you.

51:04.270 --> 51:08.190
You're the kind who loves deeply,
believes in the sanctity of the home,

51:08.274 --> 51:11.443
suffers in silence, broods and waits.

51:11.527 --> 51:13.820
You had every reason to hate him.

51:15.072 --> 51:17.616
What did you do with him, gallico?

51:17.700 --> 51:20.077
How did you get rid of it?

51:23.038 --> 51:26.916
Was this thing already built
and hidden away?

51:27.001 --> 51:29.712
Waiting for a job like that?

51:29.795 --> 51:32.672
Ormond was seen alive two weeks ago.

51:32.756 --> 51:35.133
The prentisses identified him.

51:35.217 --> 51:39.137
- That didn't have to be him.
- Who else could it have been?

51:39.221 --> 51:41.973
It could have been you, gallico.

51:42.057 --> 51:44.267
From what ormond told me,
you are a clever mimic,

51:44.351 --> 51:47.479
developed a wonderful new makeup,
something new in the theater.

51:47.563 --> 51:50.607
Something that might be
used offstage, too.

51:50.691 --> 51:54.486
Only a man who dreams up illusions
would think of such a thing,

51:54.570 --> 51:57.990
and only people of the theater
would know it was possible.

51:58.073 --> 52:02.573
Lieutenant Bruce thinks
he has ormond's fingerprints.

52:03.162 --> 52:06.874
What if he should think
to compare them with yours?

52:12.046 --> 52:14.673
This belongs to me.

52:16.175 --> 52:20.675
And so does everything
that comes out of that brain of yours.

52:21.513 --> 52:24.474
From now on
you're a private enterprise.

52:24.558 --> 52:28.270
Ah, I may incorporate you.

52:42.451 --> 52:45.203
Get your souvenir programs here.

52:45.287 --> 52:48.248
Pictures of each and every act
you saw on the stage tonight.

52:48.332 --> 52:50.917
Learn how to read
your own horoscope.

52:51.001 --> 52:54.713
The secrets of the stars
taught in ten easy lessons.

52:56.382 --> 53:00.052
All instructions for performing
5o different feats of magic.

53:00.135 --> 53:04.635
Souvenir programs of the great Rinaldi,
the one and only Rinaldi.

53:06.767 --> 53:09.060
- Mr. Rinaldi.
- Oh, lieutenant. How do you do?

53:09.144 --> 53:11.855
L'm fine, thank you.
It sounded like a good matinee out there.

53:11.939 --> 53:14.191
Yes, we were sold out as usual.

53:14.274 --> 53:15.752
I wonder if I could see you
for a moment.

53:15.776 --> 53:17.778
I have an evening performance.
I must rest.

53:17.861 --> 53:20.613
Of course,
but I actually mean a moment.

53:20.698 --> 53:23.784
L'm not looking for an autograph.
This is police business.

53:23.867 --> 53:25.827
Very well.

53:31.667 --> 53:35.170
Please, uh, sit down.

53:37.131 --> 53:39.925
You will pardon me
if I change while you are here.

53:40.008 --> 53:41.426
Of course.

53:42.636 --> 53:47.136
Mr. Rinaldi, you've said repeatedly you
don't believe Ross ormond killed his wife.

53:47.224 --> 53:48.642
That is correct.

53:48.726 --> 53:50.644
Do you still hold that opinion?

53:50.728 --> 53:52.563
I am not sure that I do.

53:52.646 --> 53:54.105
Did you have any reason to suspect

53:54.189 --> 53:57.567
that some other person might have been
with Mrs. ormond when she was killed?

53:57.651 --> 54:00.779
Why do you ask that?
Have you found new evidence?

54:00.863 --> 54:03.407
No, but let's say I've hit
upon a new theory.

54:03.490 --> 54:07.577
But you were so positive it was ormond.
You showed us his fingerprints.

54:07.661 --> 54:09.829
I showed you what I assumed
to be his prints.

54:09.913 --> 54:11.998
To make sure I'm on the right track,

54:12.082 --> 54:16.127
I want a set of fingerprints from every person
who was well acquainted with Mrs. ormond.

54:16.211 --> 54:18.338
That includes you and Mr. gallico.

54:18.422 --> 54:20.507
I have my equipment here
with me.

54:20.591 --> 54:24.261
But what right have you to ask that of me?
Am I a suspect?

54:24.344 --> 54:26.095
Well, no, of course not.

54:26.180 --> 54:29.183
What possible use
could you make of my prints?

54:29.266 --> 54:32.477
Don't you understand? They can prove
a person innocent as well as guilty.

54:32.561 --> 54:35.814
I do not have to prove my innocence.

54:35.898 --> 54:38.150
Don't you want this case solved?

54:38.233 --> 54:40.443
That is police business, not mine.

54:40.527 --> 54:43.988
And now, if you will excuse me,
lieutenant.

54:44.072 --> 54:46.074
Just as you say, sir.

54:46.158 --> 54:48.118
Sorry to have troubled you.

54:49.119 --> 54:50.745
Thanks for letting me see you.

55:33.080 --> 55:34.956
Judas priest.

55:39.211 --> 55:40.754
Sir, I've got something to show you.

55:40.838 --> 55:42.649
Well, all right, what is it?
What have you found?

55:42.673 --> 55:44.424
Today at the 44th street theater,

55:44.508 --> 55:46.778
I asked Rinaldi to let me take
his fingerprints and he refused.

55:46.802 --> 55:48.887
Rinaldi. What the devil?

55:48.971 --> 55:51.014
Sir, please. Will you listen?

55:51.098 --> 55:53.338
After he left the theater,
i broke into his dressing room

55:53.392 --> 55:56.436
and photographed some prints
from objects on his makeup table.

55:56.520 --> 55:58.522
This is one of them.
This is ormond's.

55:58.605 --> 56:00.898
Ormond and Rinaldi
are the same man.

56:00.983 --> 56:03.068
That's the craziest thing
i ever heard.

56:03.151 --> 56:05.380
You can see for yourself.
The prints are exactly the same.

56:05.404 --> 56:07.632
Which proves that you can't depend
on that method of identification.

56:07.656 --> 56:11.826
But you can, sir. The fingerprints
of different persons are never the same.

56:11.910 --> 56:14.590
L'm going to bring in Rinaldi
and hold him on a suspicion of murder.

56:14.663 --> 56:18.583
On evidence like this? Do you want to
make a laughingstock of the department?

56:18.667 --> 56:20.562
The system's too new.
We don't know enough about it.

56:20.586 --> 56:24.089
At least let me assign a couple of men
to watch him. Let me make sure of him.

56:24.172 --> 56:26.174
All right. All right.

56:26.258 --> 56:28.361
But don't make an arrest
until you get the goods on him.

56:28.385 --> 56:31.096
And I don't mean fingerprints.

56:33.557 --> 56:38.057
But how you can work in the same room where
that poor girl was killed is beyond me.

56:40.606 --> 56:42.858
The thoughts of a murderer
and his victim

56:42.941 --> 56:45.985
are supposed to linger
on the atmosphere of a room.

56:46.069 --> 56:50.569
Why, I... I getjust the mood
i want in here.

56:52.117 --> 56:54.160
Well, you can have it.

56:54.244 --> 56:56.162
Good luck on your murderer.

56:57.372 --> 57:01.872
Oh, I say, there was a very nice one
in the fall river thing.

57:02.044 --> 57:03.837
The killer used an ax, and...

57:03.921 --> 57:06.924
Oh, no, no, no, no,
don't tell me now, frank. Save it.

57:07.007 --> 57:08.299
I shall.

57:10.594 --> 57:12.012
Frank!

57:12.930 --> 57:14.932
- Do they know who did it?
- Know who?

57:15.015 --> 57:19.227
Oh, oh, no. Some neighbor saw him,
but he was wearing a mask.

57:26.735 --> 57:30.572
<i>His impersonation of the man
he had killed was perfect.</i>

57:30.656 --> 57:34.534
<i>The mask he wore was equally perfect.</i>

57:34.618 --> 57:38.997
<i>Another face that fitted him
like an outer skin.</i>

57:40.791 --> 57:44.961
<i>Thin as tissue and elastic enough</i>

57:45.045 --> 57:49.545
<i>to give with every move
of the facial muscles.</i>

57:55.681 --> 57:57.432
Frank. Frank.

58:04.356 --> 58:06.441
Frank, I've got it.

58:06.525 --> 58:10.153
- Your... Your plot?
- No. What actually happened.

58:10.237 --> 58:13.865
Remember I told you how much Mr.
Gallico reminded me of ormond?

58:13.949 --> 58:14.950
Yes.

58:15.033 --> 58:18.578
Well, there had to be a reason for that,
and I think I know what it is.

58:18.662 --> 58:22.749
They've never found a trace of ormond. I don't
believe that he was ever in this house.

58:22.833 --> 58:26.795
I believe it was gallico
who rented those rooms upstairs.

58:26.878 --> 58:28.629
Wearing greasepaint makeup?

58:28.714 --> 58:32.801
Oh, no, frank, no. You were right about
that. It had to be more than a makeup.

58:32.884 --> 58:35.261
I think it was a mask.

58:35.345 --> 58:36.346
Alice.

58:36.430 --> 58:40.930
A face, I mean. The face of ormond.
That must have been his secret.

58:41.101 --> 58:43.461
How else could he have made
those quick changes in his show?

58:43.520 --> 58:46.606
I don't believe it. It is too incredible.

58:46.690 --> 58:51.190
But I'm convinced of it. So convinced that
I'm going to lieutenant Bruce right now.

58:51.278 --> 58:53.321
Alice, I forbid it.

58:53.405 --> 58:55.615
My dear, don't be ridiculous.

58:57.242 --> 58:59.369
Karen should be here soon.

58:59.453 --> 59:03.248
I'll be honest with you, Mrs. prentiss.
Lt's my job to follow up every lead I get,

59:03.331 --> 59:06.208
but I'm afraid your theory is going
to steer us right up a blind alley.

59:06.293 --> 59:07.794
I was worried about it myself,

59:07.878 --> 59:10.964
until you told me that the fingerprints
of ormond and Rinaldi

59:11.048 --> 59:12.382
were one and the same.

59:12.466 --> 59:14.634
Doesn't that mean
they were made by one man?

59:14.718 --> 59:17.846
Yes, it does
and it could be gallico, but...

59:17.929 --> 59:19.824
I'll find out about
that before this night's over.

59:19.848 --> 59:21.891
- Hello, Karen.
- Hello. Now, look here, Alan...

59:21.975 --> 59:23.619
Honey, I'm sorry to have
to drag you down here at this hour.

59:23.643 --> 59:25.311
I should think you would be sorry.

59:25.395 --> 59:28.648
What you told me on the phone
about Mr. gallico is simply impossible.

59:28.732 --> 59:31.067
Why, he's the kindest,
sweetest man I've ever known.

59:31.151 --> 59:34.571
What he told you on the phone
was my theory, not his, Karen.

59:34.654 --> 59:36.294
Well, how can you even
think such a thing?

59:36.323 --> 59:39.326
L'm sorry. I like Mr. gallico, too.

59:39.409 --> 59:41.035
Now, listen to me, Karen.

59:41.119 --> 59:43.913
When gallico impersonated
other magicians in his show,

59:43.997 --> 59:46.499
what method did he use
to make himself look like them?

59:46.583 --> 59:50.503
Well, I don't know. He always kept it a
secret from the rest of the company.

59:50.587 --> 59:53.256
He always changed
in his dressing room.

59:53.340 --> 59:55.050
Do you think he used a mask?

59:55.133 --> 59:59.011
No. How could he even talk
or move his face with a mask on?

59:59.096 --> 01:00:01.348
It would have to be
a special kind of mask.

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:05.143
What of it? Suppose he did use one?
He never killed anybody.

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:07.229
He couldn't do such a thing.

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:10.356
Mrs. prentiss thinks that gallico might
be in there right now on the stage

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.358
impersonating Rinaldi.

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.444
That's utterly ridiculous.

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:16.821
I hope you're right.
Let's go take a look.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:43.473
You know gallico better than I do.
Better than any of us.

01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:46.560
Tell us... What do you think?

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:02.450
Well?

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:06.663
I don't understand it.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.583
He does some things
very much like Mr. gallico.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:13.336
Mrs. prentiss may be right.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:30.599
Now, if gallico's prints should match
those of ormond and Rinaldi...

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:32.772
I'm going to gallico's studio.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:35.942
May I go with you? Well, don't you
think I've earned that reward?

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.318
Karen, do something for me.

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:39.278
Wait at the stage door
till Rinaldi comes out.

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:40.654
Then talk to him.

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:43.009
Say anything you can think of,
but keep him as long as you can.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.118
In case he is gallico.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:47.162
Come on, Mrs. prentiss.

01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:03.637
Oh, don. don.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.281
Why, hello, Karen.
What are you doing here?

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.432
Why, I was waiting for Mr. Rinaldi.

01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:10.100
L'm... l'm looking for a job.

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:13.188
You see, I haven't done very much work
lately, except a little modeling.

01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:15.481
So I thought there might be
something in this show.

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.275
Oh? Well, that's too bad.

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:20.653
I came here to see
Rinaldi myself, but he's gone.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.321
Oh, I didn't see him leave.

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:26.033
No, they told me that he came out
through the front.

01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:29.203
- Can I drop you some place, Karen?
- Oh, no. No, thank you.

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:33.457
Well, I'm going straight home,
and you live near my place.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:36.669
It's much better
than waiting here for a bus.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.421
Come on. Get in.

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:42.466
Well, you're not afraid of riding
with me, are you, Karen?

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:44.051
What's your address?

01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:48.139
29 palisades Avenue.

01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:54.395
How's our friend the detective?

01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:57.148
Alan? Oh... He's all right.

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:02.487
He's having a little trouble
finding his murderer, isn't he?

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:04.572
Considerable trouble.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:16.917
Looks all right.

01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:18.795
A matter of opinion.

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:22.006
Come in. That's the door
to gallico's apartment.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.735
See if there's a rear exit.
We may have to get out of here in a hurry.

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:26.051
<i>L get you.</i>

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:07.468
- Well, thanks for the lift, don.
- That's all right.

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.303
Go to bed now
and get a good night's rest.

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:11.222
I shall. Thanks.

01:04:11.306 --> 01:04:12.682
Good night, Karen.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:14.142
Good night, don.

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:24.402
457 rensselaer drive.

01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:07.695
Yes. Mm-hmm. Sure.

01:05:09.697 --> 01:05:12.741
Well. Mm-hmm.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.299
Good evening, miss Lee.

01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:29.467
Hello.

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:53.866
I knew it.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.374
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:25.106
Hello.

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:28.818
This is Karen. Gallicds on the way to
the studio. He'll be there any minute.

01:06:28.902 --> 01:06:31.863
<i>You'd better hurry
and get out of there quick.</i>

01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:35.366
<i>All right, Karen. L'll tell Bruce.</i>

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:41.831
Well, lieutenant?

01:06:45.043 --> 01:06:47.628
L'm sorry, Mr. gallico.

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:51.340
I decided to get fingerprints from
all those who had known Mrs. ormond.

01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:53.634
I asked Rinaldi for a set of his.

01:06:54.594 --> 01:06:56.012
What did he say?

01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:57.930
Oh, he was very angry.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:01.225
I was afraid I might get
the same reception from you.

01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:03.269
You policemen don't trust anybody.

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:06.356
Why, lieutenant, I haven't the slightest
objection to giving you my prints.

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:10.609
That's very nice of you.
Do you have an ink pad here?

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:12.611
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.033
Here you are.

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:20.911
And here's some paper.
Anything else you want?

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:23.580
We'll take your left hand first.

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:28.165
Just roll it on the pad,
then make an imprint on the paper, so...

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:32.757
I'm glad to help you, lieutenant.
I... I want you to solve this case.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.426
Next, the index finger of the left hand.

01:07:36.511 --> 01:07:39.805
You know, I have
a high regard for you, lieutenant.

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:42.933
I'll always have a high regard for you.

01:07:43.017 --> 01:07:46.145
Even though we should have
a slight misunderstanding.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.573
You shouldn't have
come here, lieutenant.

01:07:57.657 --> 01:08:00.701
L'm afraid I'll have to dispose of you.

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:18.051
Ah, lieutenant,
so you're with us again.

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:20.220
It's a pity I had to deal
with you the way I did,

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:21.657
but one must be firm with policemen.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.033
Give them an inch
and they'll take a mile.

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:24.933
Gallico, you'll get
the chair for this.

01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:28.205
They'll give me the same voltage for killing
four as they would for killing three.

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:31.732
Ormond. His wife. The great Rinaldi.

01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:34.443
You should have seen how neatly
this machine disposed of him.

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:36.987
In no time at all
he was a handful of ashes.

01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:46.455
Karen. Karen. Up here.

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:49.707
Bruce is hurt.
I'm afraid gallico will kill him.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:53.462
- I'll go and get a policeman.
- No, no, there isn't time for that.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:56.173
Go to the front of the studio.
Bang on the door.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:58.133
Anything to get
gallico's attention.

01:08:58.216 --> 01:08:59.885
Hurry! Hurry!

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:03.013
You shouldn't have come nosing
around here, lieutenant.

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:05.432
Takes a little time
for a job like this,

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:07.935
but I set the machine
at 3500 degrees fahrenheit.

01:09:08.019 --> 01:09:09.937
When it nears that point,
this door will open.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.481
When it is fully opened,
the machine will roll you in.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.154
Actually,
there will be very little pain.

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:20.656
Such a blast of heat
brings instant oblivion.

01:09:21.616 --> 01:09:26.116
Can you hear it sing, lieutenant?
It has the voice of a mad bull.

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:38.381
As you can see, my crematorium
is more than an illusion.

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:40.009
You haven't seen it work, have you?

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:41.511
But you will. You'll be in it.

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:43.274
Gallico, you don't know what you're doing.

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:45.514
Yes, I know. They'll say
I'm mad, quite mad.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:48.661
They'll lock me in jail for life, put me
in a padded cell with a straitjacket.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:50.395
No, thank you.
I'll take the chair.

01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:02.239
Who's there? Who is it?

01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:03.949
What do you want?

01:10:20.591 --> 01:10:22.467
Mr. gallico, please!

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:25.096
Mr. gallico, please open the door!

01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:26.930
I can't see you now.
Get away from here.

01:10:27.014 --> 01:10:28.640
I'll get the police!

01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:33.855
Please open the door!
You don't know what you're doing!

01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:57.419
Help! Police!

01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:13.394
Help! Help! Help! Help!

01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:17.397
Bruce, are you all right?

01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:26.949
Oh!

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:42.882
They are remarkable likenesses,

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:45.884
<i>but l'll never believe a man
could get away with such a thing.</i>

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:48.220
You didn't believe
the fingerprints either.

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:49.471
You confused me.

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:52.599
You told me that ormond's
and Rinaldi's prints were the same.

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:56.061
They were. Because they
were both made by gallico.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.813
Don't take too much credit.

01:11:57.897 --> 01:12:01.400
If it hadn't been for Mrs. prentiss,
you wouldn't be alive to tell the tale,

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:04.254
and that's exactly what I'm going to tell
the newspapers, my dear lady.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:07.281
Oh, no, inspector. I won't let you.

01:12:07.365 --> 01:12:11.660
But be sure and mention
my new book, murder is a must'.

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:15.289
So nice seeing you again.
I'd better be going.

01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:20.915
Oh, dear me, I haven't everything
that I brought in with me.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.630
Let me see.

01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:26.967
Oh, yes, of course. Here it is.

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:28.677
Come, frank.
