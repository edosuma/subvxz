00:01.268 --> 00:03.003
Announcer:
PREVIOUSLY ON "CHASING LIFE"...

00:03.036 --> 00:04.137
WHO IS THIS?

00:04.171 --> 00:05.740
THAT GIRL IS OUR HALF-SISTER,
NATALIE ORTIZ.

00:05.772 --> 00:08.775
WE'VE GOT NOTHING IN COMMON
EXCEPT THE FACT THAT
WE SHARE A DAD.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.778
I HAVE LEUKEMIA, MOM.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.212
PLEASE HAVE THE SURGERY.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.414
I MADE THIS DECISION
LONG BEFORE YOU.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.283
HONESTLY, I DON'T NEED YOU
IN MY LIFE

00:16.317 --> 00:18.285
IF YOU'RE ON A MISSION
TO MAKE ME RETHINK THAT.

00:18.318 --> 00:20.653
I AM THE WRONG HORSE
FOR YOU TO BET ON.

00:20.687 --> 00:24.257
BUT THAT OTHER GUY,
THAT'S THE ONE WHO ACTUALLY
MIGHT WIN IT FOR YOU.

00:24.291 --> 00:25.626
YOU'VE GOT A LOT
OF REALLY GREAT PEOPLE
TAKING CARE OF YOU,

00:25.658 --> 00:29.028
BUT RIGHT NOW I NEED
TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

00:29.062 --> 00:31.798
Man:
WE JUST THINK IT'S IN
OUR DAUGHTER'S BEST INTEREST

00:32.031 --> 00:35.469
TO DATE SOMEONE
WITH SIMILAR AMBITIONS.

00:35.503 --> 00:38.472
THEY'RE SENDING HER OFF
TO THIS SUMMER PROGRAM
IN OXFORD.

00:38.506 --> 00:42.409
I'M JUST HOPING
THAT THEY'LL FORGET ABOUT IT
BY THE TIME SHE GETS BACK.

00:42.442 --> 00:44.344
ALL THESE FEELINGS
ARE COMING BACK,

00:44.378 --> 00:47.414
AND I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER
IF YOU'RE FEELING THEM TOO.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.649
Sara:
YOU KNOW I FEEL
WHAT YOU DO.

00:49.682 --> 00:52.219
IT'S JUST--
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.387
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- LEO'S GETTING THE SURGERY.

00:54.421 --> 00:55.756
CLEARLY YOU'VE MADE
AN IMPRESSION ON HIM.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.591
I MEAN, I GUESS
THERE'S LIKE A 50% CHANCE

00:58.625 --> 01:00.594
THAT SOMETHING COULD GO WRONG
WITH THE SURGERY.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.362
MY HAIR STARTED FALLING OUT.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.632
GOD, I'M SO SORRY.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.768
April:
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE
TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OF GOODBYES,

01:07.801 --> 01:10.837
SO I WON'T.

01:11.070 --> 01:14.375
- ( doctors chattering )
- ( machine beeping )

01:14.408 --> 01:17.311
- Woman: CHANGE THE AIRWAY.
- Man: HE'S FLAT-LINING.

ARE EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.221
YOU'RE STILL IN REMISSION.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.256
YOU JUST NEED TO COME IN
FOR BLOOD WORK EVERY TWO WEEKS.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.891
THAT'S GREAT.

02:04.123 --> 02:08.127
UM, BUT WHAT ARE THE ODDS
IT'S GOING TO COME BACK?

02:08.162 --> 02:09.796
HEY, WE JUST WON THIS ONE.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.699
LET'S NOT GET PARANOID, OKAY?

02:11.731 --> 02:14.634
ACCORDING TO THE PATIENTS'
BILL OF RIGHTS, I'M ALLOWED
TO GET PARANOID.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.469
I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT ONE,
BUT OKAY.

02:16.503 --> 02:18.305
WHAT ARE MY ODDS?

02:18.338 --> 02:19.806
60%.

02:19.840 --> 02:24.344
YOU'RE AN INTERMEDIATE RISK,
RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.

02:24.377 --> 02:27.781
I'M GUESS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
IN YOUR LIFE YOU'VE BEEN TOLD
YOU'RE AVERAGE.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.917
WHAT HAPPENS
IF IT DOES COME BACK?

02:30.150 --> 02:32.719
THEN YOU'LL NEED
A BONE-MARROW TRANSPLANT.

02:32.752 --> 02:34.420
BUT WE HAVEN'T FOUND
A FULL MATCH YET.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.723
WELL, WE WILL CONTINUE
TO SEARCH THE REGISTRY

02:36.757 --> 02:39.225
FOR A POTENTIAL DONOR,
BUT SINCE WE HAVEN'T
FOUND ONE YET,

02:39.259 --> 02:40.728
OUR CHANCES AREN'T GOOD.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.597
BUT IT'S GREAT THAT WE HAVE
YOUR MOTHER AS A HALF MATCH.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.633
IF YOUR CANCER RETURNS,
WE HAVE TO ACT QUICKLY,

02:45.665 --> 02:47.433
AND SHE IS READILY AVAILABLE.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.736
BUT YOU SAID BEFORE
THAT SHE ISN'T IDEAL?

02:49.770 --> 02:52.740
AND I READ THAT TRANSPLANTS
ARE SORT OF A ONE-SHOT THING,
RIGHT?

02:52.772 --> 02:55.643
WE USE HALF-MATCH DONORS
ALL THE TIME.

02:55.675 --> 03:00.747
BUT YES, A YOUNGER DONOR
OR SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER
BEEN PREGNANT IS BETTER,

03:00.781 --> 03:03.383
WHICH IS WHY
WE TEST SIBLINGS FIRST.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.718
SINCE BRENNA'S NOT A MATCH,
WE'LL GO WITH WHAT'S AVAILABLE.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.621
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

03:07.655 --> 03:10.456
( sighs )
EXHAUSTED.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.725
AND MY MEMORY
STILL KIND OF SUCKS.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.495
THOSE SYMPTOMS WILL FADE.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.264
I BET THEY'LL BE GONE
BY THE TIME YOU GO BACK TO WORK.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.699
I GO BACK TO WORK TOMORROW.

03:18.731 --> 03:21.835
OF COURSE, BECAUSE TOMORROW'S
THE ABSOLUTE FIRST DAY

03:21.868 --> 03:24.405
THAT I SAID IT WOULD BE SAFE
FOR YOU START.

03:24.437 --> 03:27.707
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T NEED
ANY MORE TIME TO REST?

03:27.740 --> 03:30.711
AFTER FOUR MONTHS,
THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO

03:30.743 --> 03:32.846
IS KEEP LYING AROUND.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.549
I THINK I'M CAUGHT UP
ON EVERY T.V. SHOW EVER MADE.

03:35.582 --> 03:38.384
I JUST WANT
TO GET BACK OUT THERE

03:38.418 --> 03:40.486
AND PICK UP MY LIFE
WHERE I LEFT OFF.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.323
OH, AND I FOUND A GREAT WIG.

03:42.355 --> 03:43.790
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE MY OLD HAIR.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.793
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO KNOW
HOW THEY MADE IT, BUT--

03:45.825 --> 03:47.961
I'M SURE HORSES WERE INVOLVED.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.963
THANK YOU SO MUCH,

03:49.997 --> 03:51.799
FOR EVERYTHING.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.868
ARE YOU GOING TO GO SEE HIM?

04:02.543 --> 04:04.844
WHY ISN'T THE MUSIC PLAYING?

04:04.877 --> 04:06.879
IT'S GOOD FOR THE BRAIN.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.817
( soft music playing )

04:09.849 --> 04:11.884
HEY, THERE, CANCER FRIEND.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.722
MAYBE YOU COULD
TALK TO ME TODAY?

04:14.754 --> 04:17.790
I HEARD HE WAS AWAKE
FOR AN HOUR AGAIN YESTERDAY

04:17.824 --> 04:19.726
AND THAT HE TURNED HIS HEAD

04:19.759 --> 04:21.795
WHEN HE HEARD
HIS MOTHER'S VOICE.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.497
NOT BAD AFTER
A TWO-MONTH COMA.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.699

YOU DIDN'T LOSE YOUR HAIR.

05:47.548 --> 05:50.817
OH, YEP. THANKS, MALLORY.

05:50.850 --> 05:55.088
AND YOUR SKIN IS SO PORCELAIN.

05:55.122 --> 05:58.358
IT REMINDS ME OF THE DOLLS
MY MOTHER USED TO COLLECT.

05:58.391 --> 06:01.028
AND NOT JUST CASUALLY.
SHE WENT TO DOLL CONVENTIONS

06:01.060 --> 06:03.529
ALL OVER THE WORLD
ONCE A YEAR.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.865
ONE TIME SHE SPENT
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

06:05.899 --> 06:09.569
OF MY COLLEGE FUND
ON A LIFE-SIZED CERAMIC GEISHA.

06:09.603 --> 06:13.473
PROBABLY MORE THAN YOU NEEDED
TO KNOW ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.007
MM-HMM.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.744
LET US KNOW
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

06:16.776 --> 06:17.978
THANKS, GUYS.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.081
MAN, MALLORY'S HAD A ROUGH
SUMMER.

06:21.115 --> 06:22.915
( whispering )
SHE GOT HERPES.

06:22.949 --> 06:23.983
DIDN'T SHE ALREADY HAVE IT?

06:24.016 --> 06:25.853
NO. YOU KNOW,
EVERYONE ASSUMED SHE DID,

06:25.886 --> 06:27.019
BUT APPARENTLY NOT.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.588
IT'S LIKE WHEN EVERYONE
FOUND OUT

06:28.622 --> 06:29.856
THAT I WASN'T
FIRST CHOICE
TO BE PRESIDENT

06:29.889 --> 06:31.925
OF THE HARVARD CRIMSON
JUST 'CAUSE I WAS A SOPHOMORE.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.726
BUT THEN THAT IDIOT
WAS CAUGHT DEALING COKE,

06:33.761 --> 06:36.396
I WAS ANOINTED KING
AND I KILLED IT.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.598
LUCKILY,
LAWRENCE NEVER KNEW THAT

06:38.632 --> 06:40.600
AND PROMOTED ME TO STAFF WRITER
BEFORE HE RETIRED.

06:40.634 --> 06:41.869
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S GONE.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.971
SO-- SO WHAT'S IT LIKE
WITH THE NEW GUY?

06:44.004 --> 06:47.574
UM... OH, SORRY.
NAME, PLEASE?

06:47.608 --> 06:49.909
I EMAILED YOU HIS BIO,
LIKE, TWO DAYS AGO.

06:49.942 --> 06:51.745
CHEMO BRAIN.

06:51.778 --> 06:53.913
AARON PHILLIPS.
HE'S NEVER WORKED
AT A PAPER BEFORE,

06:53.947 --> 06:55.882
BUT HE'S SAVVY,
HE'S YOUNG,

06:55.915 --> 06:57.884
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
HE SEEMS TO REALLY LIKE ME.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.052
- I NEED TO MEET HIM.
- BETTER MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.156
HE'S ALWAYS BOOKED,
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET
FACE TIME WITH.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.158
WELL, I WILL FIND A WAY.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.925
NICE WIG.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.927
GET A HAIRCUT.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.596
OH MY GOD, I FORGOT
TO TELL YOU.

07:09.629 --> 07:10.963
RAQUEL AND I
FINALLY SLEPT TOGETHER.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.000
- WHAT?
- ( sighs )

07:13.033 --> 07:14.434
MAN, I WISH.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.983
( soft music playing )

07:31.018 --> 07:32.920
( laughs )
LET ME SEE HER PICTURE.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.086
SOMEONE'S JEALOUS.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.023
UH, YEAH, RIGHT.

07:36.055 --> 07:37.658
( laughs )

07:37.691 --> 07:40.894
OH, I'VE TOTALLY MET HER.

07:40.927 --> 07:42.663
ARE YOU SURE SHE'S STRAIGHT?

07:42.696 --> 07:43.963
I SWEAR SHE FLIRTED WITH ME

07:43.997 --> 07:45.699
LAST TIME SHE WAS
AT THE GALLERY.

07:45.731 --> 07:47.867
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING THERE
AFTER EVERYTHING YOU PUT ME
THROUGH?

07:47.901 --> 07:50.704
OH, COME ON.
YOU MOVED ON PRETTY FAST.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.906
I'M SO GLAD WE CAN TALK
ABOUT THIS STUFF NOW

07:52.939 --> 07:54.574
- AND IT'S NOT WEIRD.
- I KNOW.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.877
- IT'S VERY MATURE OF US.
- MMM.

07:56.909 --> 07:59.545
WHAT'S UP WITH YOUR GIRL?
GREER'S COMING BACK SOON, RIGHT?

07:59.579 --> 08:02.716
OH, YEAH.
TOMORROW, THANK GOD.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.050
FEELS LIKE IT'S BEEN A YEAR.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.519
WHATEVER.

08:06.552 --> 08:08.521
ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS THAT SHE'S COMING BACK.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.257
HER PARENTS CAN KISS MY ASS.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.927
OH, I'M SURE
THEY DON'T KISS ASSES.
THEY HIRE PEOPLE FOR THAT.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.862
( laughs )

08:15.896 --> 08:18.932
Madeline:
OKAY, ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET ME FIRED?

08:18.966 --> 08:20.901
I TOLD YOU, HE ONLY EATS
HIS SUSHI WITH SOY PAPER.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.903
AND MAKE SURE THAT THE MAYO
IS REDUCED FAT.

08:22.935 --> 08:25.939
NOT FAT-FREE, NOT FULL-FAT.
TRUST ME, HE'LL BE ABLE TO TELL.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.074
ARE YOU AARON'S ASSISTANT?

08:27.106 --> 08:29.209
I'M APRIL CARVER,
ONE OF HIS STAFF WRITERS.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.978
I JUST GOT BACK
FROM MEDICAL LEAVE,

08:31.011 --> 08:32.044
- AND I WAS WONDERING--
- ( phone beeping )

08:32.078 --> 08:33.513
AARON PHILLIPS' OFFICE.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.148
HE'S IN A MEETING.
HE'LL CALL BACK.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.018
AARON PHILLIPS' OFFICE.
HE'S IN A MEETING.
HE'LL CALL BACK.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.519
I'D LIKE TO MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT WITH AARON.

08:39.552 --> 08:41.788
DOES HE HAVE ANYTHING
IN THE NEXT, LIKE, HOUR OR TWO?

08:41.822 --> 08:44.658
IN THE NEXT HOUR?
MORE LIKE IN THE NEXT
EIGHT DAYS.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.592
I'M SORRY.
I WORK HERE--

08:46.626 --> 08:47.793
AARON PHILLIPS' OFFICE.

08:47.827 --> 08:49.796
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT DOESN'T FIT?

08:49.830 --> 08:52.899
THE CABINET WAS CUSTOM-MADE
FOR THE TELEVISION.

08:52.932 --> 08:55.034
I'M SORRY,
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.773
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'RE NOT
TOTALLY CONVINCED

08:59.806 --> 09:01.707
THAT YOUR NEW BOSS
ACTUALLY EXISTS.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.176
I DON'T REALLY SEE
HOW THAT'S A PROBLEM.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.144
WHAT I NEED TO KNOW IS

09:05.177 --> 09:07.147
HOW IS THE BOYFRIEND
IN A COMA?

09:07.179 --> 09:08.981
UH, TECHNICALLY
NOT IN A COMA ANYMORE,

09:09.015 --> 09:10.182
BUT STILL NOT RESPONDING,

09:10.216 --> 09:12.019
AND NOT MY BOYFRIEND.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.056
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS IF
HE'LL EVEN REMEMBER WHO I AM

09:16.088 --> 09:17.724
WHEN HE FINALLY TALKS.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.059
YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE'S
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON,

09:20.092 --> 09:22.729
LIKE THOSE PEOPLE THAT
YOU READ ABOUT WHEN THEY WAKE UP
AFTER A HEAD TRAUMA

09:22.763 --> 09:25.264
AND THEY CAN SUDDENLY,
LIKE, SPEAK FLUENT GERMAN

09:25.298 --> 09:28.567
OR, I DON'T KNOW,
SUDDENLY MUSICAL GENIUSES.

09:28.601 --> 09:31.004
MAYBE HE COULD WRITE
A SYMPHONY IN YOUR HONOR.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.338
THANK YOU.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.673
THANK YOU.

09:33.706 --> 09:35.142
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT ME?

09:35.174 --> 09:37.744
THE MOST ROMANTIC SITUATION
IN MY LIFE

09:37.778 --> 09:40.013
INVOLVES A GUY WHO
IS UNRESPONSIVE TO STIMULI.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.914
THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE SEX

09:41.948 --> 09:44.183
WITH SOMEONE WHO'S CONSCIOUS.
( giggles )

09:44.216 --> 09:48.221
I LOVE THIS.
I LOVE THAT WE'RE NOW
TWO WORKING GIRLS WHO LUNCH.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.591
I DON'T KNOW IF
PERSONAL ASSISTANT
REALLY COUNTS AS A REAL JOB.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.894
- YOU'VE GOT TO START SOMEWHERE.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.062
I MEAN, YOU WANT TO WORK
IN FASHION AND YOUR BOSS
IS A GREAT DESIGNER.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.066
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

09:59.099 --> 10:01.067
BEFORE SHE STARTS
COMPLIMENTING YOUR CUTE STYLE

10:01.100 --> 10:02.601
AND YOU OFFER TO SHOW HER--

10:02.635 --> 10:05.739
HOW I SPEND HOURS
OF MY FREE TIME
ADVISING MY ROOMMATE

10:05.772 --> 10:07.341
ON WHAT TO WEAR
ON HER STUPID DATES.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.241
MM-HMM.
MORGAN IS STILL CRAZY?

10:09.275 --> 10:11.778
IT'S JUST-- IT'S SO HARD
BEING AROUND SOMEONE

10:11.812 --> 10:14.081
WHO IS SO DESPERATE
AND INSECURE.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.951
SHE SAYS TO THE GIRL
ANGSTING OVER A GUY IN A COMA.

10:17.985 --> 10:21.053
- SO...
- ( laughs ) OH MY GOD.

10:21.087 --> 10:24.024
Sara:
WELL, WHAT A BIG DAY.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.359
HOW WAS IT?

10:25.392 --> 10:26.927
A LITTLE OVERWHELMING,

10:26.960 --> 10:28.928
- BUT REALLY GOOD TO BE BACK.
- YEAH, I CAN IMAGINE.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.398
YOU'VE ALWAYS FOUND WORK
SO ENERGIZING.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.933
YEAH, YOU'RE STILL
THE SAME HUGE NERD
YOU WERE BEFORE CHEMO.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.936
AND THANK GOD FOR THAT.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.270
YES.
( laughs )

10:42.042 --> 10:43.342
IS THE WIG BOTHERING YOU?

10:43.376 --> 10:46.245
IT'S JUST ITCHY.
I'LL GET USED TO IT.

10:46.278 --> 10:47.947
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT OFF?

10:47.980 --> 10:49.750
YOU'RE IN THE HOUSE,
JUST US.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.851
OH, THAT'S OKAY.
I'M WAY TOO VAIN.

10:51.884 --> 10:54.254
YOU TAKE AFTER ME.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.856
SO, GUYS, I...

10:56.889 --> 10:59.158
DR. HAMBURG
SAID SOMETHING YESTERDAY

10:59.192 --> 11:01.094
AND I KEEP THINKING ABOUT IT.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.962
WELL, THAT BODES WELL
FOR YOUR MEMORY.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.032
- I WROTE IT DOWN.
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?

11:05.065 --> 11:08.100
SHE SAID THAT MOM
ISN'T THE MOST IDEAL HALF MATCH

11:08.134 --> 11:09.903
FOR MY TRANSPLANT.

11:09.936 --> 11:13.173
SHE SAID THAT IT WOULD
BE BETTER IF WE COULD
FIND SOMEONE YOUNGER.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.942
AND SINCE THE CHANCES ARE
PRETTY HIGH OF MY CANCER
COMING BACK,

11:15.975 --> 11:18.745
WE JUST WANT TO FIND
THE BEST MATCH POSSIBLE.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.750
SHOULD WE ASK NATALIE
TO GET TESTED?

11:23.783 --> 11:25.851
( sighs )

11:27.086 --> 11:29.188
MAYBE THAT'S STUPID.
NEVER MIND.

11:29.221 --> 11:33.759
NO NO, WAIT A SECOND.
MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER IT

11:33.793 --> 11:36.028
IF IT'S
REALLY A BETTER OPTION.

11:36.062 --> 11:37.831
GEORGE, IS THAT TRUE?

11:37.864 --> 11:42.001
IF SHE'S A HALF MATCH, YES.
BUT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF SHE IS.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.203
SHE'D NEVER DO IT.
SHE'S, LIKE, EVIL.

11:44.236 --> 11:47.807
DID YOU EVER ACTUALLY
ASK NATALIE TO GET TESTED?

11:47.841 --> 11:49.042
I MEAN, NOT REALLY.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.043
SO WHAT'S THE HARM?

11:51.077 --> 11:52.312
SHE DRUGGED GREER.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.313
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR SURE.

11:54.346 --> 11:56.182
STILL, SHE'S SELFISH.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.485
JUST TRUST ME.
IS IT REALLY WORTH IT?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.888
YES, IT IS.

12:01.922 --> 12:05.225
WE SHOULD GET YOU
THE BEST DONOR POSSIBLE.

12:05.258 --> 12:08.227
MAYBE I SHOULD
APPROACH OLIVIA.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.797
SARA...

12:10.831 --> 12:11.998
MOM, SERIOUSLY, IT'S FINE.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.000
IF ANYTHING, I COULD
GET IN TOUCH WITH NATALIE.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.102
NO, I DON'T WANT TO GO
AROUND HER MOTHER ON THIS.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.840
I MANAGED TO AVOID
MEETING OLIVIA

12:19.873 --> 12:22.109
WHEN WE HAD TO DEAL
WITH THOMAS'S ESTATE.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.211
BUT NOW MAYBE IT'S TIME.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.879
ARE YOU SURE?

12:25.912 --> 12:28.948
I MEAN, YOU'VE GONE THIS LONG
WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO MEET HER.

12:28.981 --> 12:31.150
WELL, NOW WE NEED TO MEET HER.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.091
AARON, I'LL BE
IN THE COPY ROOM.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.894
OKAY.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.864
YEAH, YOU GOT IT.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.268
MR. PHILLIPS?

12:48.301 --> 12:50.504
I'M APRIL CARVER,
ONE OF YOUR STAFF WRITERS.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.371
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?
DID YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?

12:52.404 --> 12:55.808
I TRIED TO MAKE ONE.
YOUR FIRST AVAILABILITY
WASN'T FOR EIGHT DAYS.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.409
I JUST WANTED
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.011
YESTERDAY
WAS MY FIRST DAY BACK.

12:59.044 --> 13:01.014
OH, RIGHT.
YOU HAVE CANCER.

13:01.047 --> 13:03.316
IT'S TERRIBLE.
GREAT WRITER, THOUGH.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.351
NICE PIECE ON BRUCE HENDRIE
DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE.

13:05.384 --> 13:06.852
UH, THANK YOU.

13:06.886 --> 13:08.421
THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.923
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO
TREAT ME ANY DIFFERENTLY

13:10.956 --> 13:12.491
JUST BECAUSE
I'M DEALING WITH SOME--

13:12.525 --> 13:14.193
CANCER?
GOT IT, I RESPECT THAT.
ONE SEC.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.562
- ( beeps )
- HAILEY, HEY, IT'S DAD.

13:15.794 --> 13:19.198
CAN YOU TELL MOM
I NEED THE BLUE SUIT
FOR TONIGHT?

13:19.231 --> 13:21.234
THANKS.
YOU'RE MY ANGEL.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.969
OKAY.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.136
ANYTHING ELSE?

13:24.171 --> 13:26.038
I DON'T WANT TO STOP
GETTING IMPORTANT STORIES.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.441
I WILL PULL MY WEIGHT,
JUST LIKE I ALWAYS HAVE.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.009
ASK ANYONE ON THE STAFF--

13:30.043 --> 13:31.577
YEAH, OKAY.
I'LL SEE WHAT I GOT.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.380
OH. OKAY.

13:34.413 --> 13:35.881
GREAT.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.250
THANK YOU.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.988
Sara:
WHAT, DO I CALL HER?
SEND HER A LETTER?

13:42.022 --> 13:43.889
WHAT IS THIS, 1985?

13:43.923 --> 13:46.025
I CAN GIVE YOU
HER EMAIL ADDRESS.

13:46.058 --> 13:48.528
OKAY.
SO WHAT'S OLIVIA LIKE?

13:48.562 --> 13:50.197
( sighs )

13:50.230 --> 13:52.032
WELL, I DIDN'T SPEND
THAT MUCH TIME WITH HER,

13:52.065 --> 13:54.834
- BUT, UM, NICE.
- GREAT.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.235
SHE'S A FLORIST

13:56.269 --> 14:00.240
AND SHE OWNED A LITTLE SHOP
IN KEY LARGO.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.842
AND SHE'S VERY CLOSE
TO NATALIE.

14:03.876 --> 14:06.879
AND THEY WERE TAKING
SURFING LESSONS LAST TIME
I SAW THEM.

14:06.913 --> 14:09.282
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.
I GUESS I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ANYMORE ABOUT THIS.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.150
- OKAY.
- LET'S TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.184
'KAY, GOOD.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.086
YOU LOOKING FORWARD
TO TOMORROW NIGHT?

14:14.120 --> 14:16.088
- OH.
- WHY?

14:16.121 --> 14:18.457
- OH, GOD.
- IT'S EXCITING,
THE HOSPITAL HONORING YOU.

14:18.490 --> 14:19.993
I DON'T KNOW
WHY THEY CHOSE ME.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.427
I HATE BEING
THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.931
WELL, SOMETIMES
YOU DESERVE TO BE.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.265
WELL...

14:30.903 --> 14:32.038
( giggling )

14:32.072 --> 14:34.240
( chattering )

14:34.274 --> 14:35.975
SOMEBODY'S OUTSIDE THE OFFICE.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.409
THE GIRLS ARE NOT HERE.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.278
- I KNOW THEY'RE NOT.
- THEY'RE NOT HERE.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.347
I'VE GOTTEN SO PARANOID.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.183
I'M PARANOID.
I REALLY AM.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.519
I DON'T LIKE SNEAKING AROUND
AND KEEPING THIS FROM THEM.

14:46.552 --> 14:47.921
RIGHT.

14:47.953 --> 14:49.655
WITH ALL THE SECRETS
OUR FAMILY'S KEPT--

14:49.889 --> 14:53.092
I-- I UNDERSTAND, BUT WE
DECIDED THAT SINCE APRIL IS
GOING THROUGH CHEMO,

14:53.125 --> 14:55.095
- IT WOULDN'T BE--
- WHAT ABOUT NOW THAT SHE'S OUT?

14:55.128 --> 14:57.998
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT WE-- WE CAN
TALK ABOUT IT,

14:58.030 --> 15:00.066
BUT LET'S WAIT
FOR 30 MORE MINUTES.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.067
- JUST PLEASE.
- ( laughing )

15:15.481 --> 15:17.951
HEY.

15:17.984 --> 15:21.520
( sighs )
GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.226
( beeps )

15:36.001 --> 15:39.572
I'M REALLY EXCITED
FOR OUR MEETING LATER.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.140
ME TOO.

15:41.173 --> 15:43.109
I'LL MAKE SURE
TO COME PREPARED.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.044
YOU BETTER.

15:50.482 --> 15:53.720
Emma:
SHE REALLY OVERUSES
THE WHITE CARNATIONS, HUH?

15:53.952 --> 15:55.087
I KNOW.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.590
THESE ARRANGEMENTS
ARE REALLY TACKY,

15:57.624 --> 15:59.725
- DON'T YOU THINK?
- YEAH.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.594
WE'RE HORRIBLE.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.596
NO, WE'RE JUST WOMEN OF TASTE.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.700
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.604
UM...

16:11.638 --> 16:14.006
HOW DO I START?

16:14.039 --> 16:16.609
"DEAR EVIL SEDUCTRESS..."

16:16.643 --> 16:18.244
- MOM.
- WHAT?

16:18.278 --> 16:21.047
YOU HAVE TO WRITE
THE BAD VERSION FIRST,

16:21.081 --> 16:22.649
THEN REWRITE.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.250
UM, I'LL-- I'LL DICTATE,

16:25.284 --> 16:26.686
YOU TYPE. OKAY?

16:26.720 --> 16:28.520
UM...

16:28.554 --> 16:33.025
"DEAR HUSBAND STEALING WHORE..."

16:34.027 --> 16:35.662
"REMEMBER ME,

16:35.695 --> 16:39.065
THE WOMEN WHO WAS MARRIED
TO THE MAN YOU SEDUCED

16:39.099 --> 16:42.201
AND WHO 'ACCIDENTALLY'
KNOCKED YOU UP?

16:42.235 --> 16:44.636
WELL, NOW IT'S PAYBACK TIME."

16:44.671 --> 16:47.206
YOU DON'T NEED MY HELP AT ALL.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.408
OH, GOD.
OKAY, THIS IS FUN.

16:49.442 --> 16:53.212
BUT SERIOUSLY, WHAT AM I
GOING TO SAY TO THIS WOMAN?

16:53.245 --> 16:56.216
( both sigh )

16:56.249 --> 16:58.551
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.620
- YOU WANT SOME TEA?
- SURE.

17:05.557 --> 17:07.760
OOPS.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.596
I JUST WANTED
TO READ WHAT YOU WROTE

17:10.630 --> 17:13.566
AND I HIT ONE OF THE KEYS
BY MISTAKE AND I THINK I--

17:13.599 --> 17:15.634
NO, NO, NO,
DON'T TELL ME YOU SENT IT.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.569
NO.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.073
BUT THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE
WAS PRICELESS.

17:20.105 --> 17:21.740
- OH.
- ( laughs )

17:21.775 --> 17:24.477
OH, MY GOSH.
I'M TAKING THIS AWAY FROM YOU.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.179
( laughing )

17:26.211 --> 17:29.048
- ( music playing )
- April: YOU'RE BEING SELFISH.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.383
THERE, I SAID IT.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.451
YOU'RE JUST
LYING THERE PEACEFULLY

17:32.484 --> 17:35.054
WHILE I HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE REAL WORLD.

17:35.087 --> 17:38.391
SERIOUSLY, IF YOU DON'T
START TALKING TO ME SOON,

17:38.424 --> 17:40.226
I'M GOING TO STOP
TALKING TO YOU.

17:40.259 --> 17:42.761
YOU KNOW, THE SILENT TREATMENT
CAN GO BOTH WAYS, BUDDY.

17:44.631 --> 17:48.701
I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER
COUPLE OF DAYS, THOUGH.

17:48.734 --> 17:52.238
RIGHT NOW YOU JUST
HAVE TO KEEP LISTENING
TO MY BORING STORIES.

17:52.271 --> 17:54.707
I GOT MY FIRST ASSIGNMENT
FROM THE NEW BOSS.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.576
UM, I'M PROFILING
A FRIEND OF HIS.

17:56.608 --> 18:01.580
SHE'S THIS--
THIS MULTIMILLIONAIRE C.E.O.,

18:01.614 --> 18:03.348
LIKE INTERNET MARTHA STEWART,

18:03.383 --> 18:06.553
AND SHE JUST HAD A BABY.
SO IT'S ABOUT HOW WOMEN
CAN HAVE IT ALL.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.421
( laughs )
OBVIOUSLY, JUST LOOK AT ME.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.623
I HAVE CANCER

18:10.656 --> 18:13.526
AND A CRUSH ON A GUY
IN A COMA

18:13.559 --> 18:17.529
AND AN EX-BOYFRIEND
WHO HATES MY GUTS.

18:17.564 --> 18:22.402
GOD, WHY COULDN'T DOMINIC
HAVE JUST STAYED OUT
OF THE COUNTRY?

18:25.204 --> 18:26.605
LEO?

18:26.638 --> 18:28.641
LEO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

18:28.674 --> 18:30.609
IT'S APRIL.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.749
THEN HE OPENED HIS EYES

18:36.782 --> 18:39.117
AND SAID NOTHING.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.619
- NOTHING?
- NOTHING.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.890
OH, GOD,
THIS IS THE SLOWEST-MOVING
SOAP OPERA I'VE EVER WATCHED.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.226
I KNOW, BUT, BETH,
HE OPENED HIS EYES

18:46.259 --> 18:47.861
AS SOON AS
I SAID DOMINIC'S NAME.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.729
DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS
HE REMEMBERS

18:49.761 --> 18:52.164
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US,
LIKE, AT THE FUNERAL HOME?

18:52.198 --> 18:53.665
OR ANYTHING
BEFORE HIS SURGERY?

18:53.700 --> 18:55.701
YOU HAVE TO STOP
ROMANTICIZING THIS.

18:55.734 --> 18:59.672
YOU CAN'T KEEP ANALYZING
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
A GUY IN A COMA.

18:59.705 --> 19:02.275
YOU'RE JUST
NOT GOING TO KNOW ANYTHING
UNTIL HE WAKES UP.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.809
I'M NOT ROMANTICIZING IT.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.479
YEAH, YOU ARE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GET IT.

19:06.512 --> 19:09.249
I GET IT. YOU'VE BEEN
VISITING HIM ALMOST EVERY DAY
FOR FOUR MONTHS.

19:09.281 --> 19:12.352
BUT, I JUST--
I HATE TO SEE YOU PROJECTING,

19:12.384 --> 19:14.253
YOU KNOW,
ALL THIS STUFF ON HIM

19:14.287 --> 19:15.622
AND THINKING
THAT YOU'RE IN LOVE.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.656
UH, WHAT-- WHEN DID I SAY
I WAS IN LOVE?

19:17.690 --> 19:20.559
YOU DIDN'T, BUT I CAN TELL
THAT YOU'RE ATTACHED.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.195
AND UNTIL YOU KNOW THAT
HE'S AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON,

19:23.229 --> 19:25.531
THAT ATTACHMENT
ONLY GOES ONE WAY.

19:31.203 --> 19:32.672
YOU'RE BACK.

19:32.704 --> 19:35.708
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE ACTUALLY HERE.

19:35.741 --> 19:37.844
- YOU LOOK GREAT.
- THANKS. YOU TOO.

19:37.876 --> 19:40.880
OKAY,
I WANT TO HEAR EVERYTHING,

19:40.913 --> 19:42.882
ESPECIALLY ABOUT THAT WEEK
AT CAMBRIDGE.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.750
YEAH,
IT WAS REALLY PRETTY THERE.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.586
JUST PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
IF YOU MADE OUT WITH
ANY CUTE ENGLISH GIRLS

19:47.619 --> 19:50.355
BECAUSE I CANNOT COMPETE
WITH THOSE ACCENTS.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.358
- I DIDN'T.
- OH, THIS IS
REALLY LAST-MINUTE,

19:53.393 --> 19:54.894
BUT THERE'S
THIS FUNDRAISER TONIGHT.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.563
IT'S KIND OF
IN MY UNCLE'S HONOR,

19:56.596 --> 19:58.964
AND IT'S BLACK TIE.
DO YOU WANT TO BE MY DATE?

19:59.198 --> 20:02.367
IT'S GONNA BE ALL FANCY,
AND YOU LOVE FUNDRAISERS.

20:02.402 --> 20:05.805
UM, I--

20:05.837 --> 20:06.940
WHAT?

20:06.972 --> 20:09.709
BRENNA, I KNOW BEFORE I LEFT,

20:09.741 --> 20:13.346
WE WERE THINKING
MY PARENTS WOULD FORGET
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

20:13.378 --> 20:15.647
AND THEY WOULDN'T CARE
IF WE SAW EACH OTHER.

20:15.682 --> 20:18.651
BUT THEY STILL DO.

20:18.684 --> 20:21.220
AND IT'S EVEN WORSE
THAN IT WAS BEFORE.

20:21.253 --> 20:23.756
NOW THAT WE'RE JUNIORS,
THEY'RE JUST, LIKE, SO OBSESSED

20:23.789 --> 20:26.558
ABOUT ME DOING WELL THIS YEAR
SO I CAN GET INTO COLLEGE.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.827
AND THEY DON'T THINK
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

20:28.861 --> 20:30.863
IF WE'RE SEEING EACH OTHER.

20:30.896 --> 20:34.701
ARE YOU REALLY GOING
TO DO WHAT THEY SAY?

20:34.733 --> 20:37.369
I WISH I COULD
STAND UP TO THEM,

20:37.403 --> 20:39.372
BUT I AM NOT LIKE YOU.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.374
BUT THEY'RE, LIKE,
BARELY AROUND.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.809
I KNOW, BUT THEY ALSO
PAY FOR EVERYTHING.

20:43.843 --> 20:47.012
AND THEY LIKE TO REMIND ME
THAT INCLUDES COLLEGE.

20:47.246 --> 20:51.784
I JUST CAN'T RISK THEM
CUTTING ME OFF

20:51.817 --> 20:53.853
AFTER ALL THE HARD WORK
I PUT INTO SCHOOL.

20:53.885 --> 20:57.557
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY THINK
THIS IS PATHETIC,

20:57.589 --> 21:00.026
BUT I JUST DON'T SEE
ANOTHER OPTION.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.934
♪ GO ON WITHOUT YOU ♪

21:08.968 --> 21:10.670
♪ JUST GO ON WITHOUT YOU... ♪

21:10.702 --> 21:12.805
I'M REALLY SORRY.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.807
♪ GO ON WITHOUT YOU... ♪

21:14.840 --> 21:16.843
( song continues )

21:22.015 --> 21:24.651
♪ UP ALL NIGHT. ♪

21:24.683 --> 21:27.987
AND A COUPLE YEARS LATER,
EVERYTHING EXPLODED WHEN
I STARTED MY WEBSITE.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.655
THAT'S HOW I MET AARON.

21:29.689 --> 21:32.724
I HIRED HIM BECAUSE
HE SPECIALIZES IN START-UPS,
AND IT WORKED.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.727
NOW MY BUSINESS
IS EXCLUSIVELY ONLINE.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.863
AND YOU SOLD IT FOR, UM...

21:36.895 --> 21:39.798
SORRY, HOLD ON.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.067
$40 MILLION.

21:41.299 --> 21:43.403
THAT'S REALLY AMAZING.

21:43.435 --> 21:46.338
THANK YOU, BUT HONESTLY,
IT'S NOTHING COMPARED

21:46.372 --> 21:47.973
TO WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
BEING A PARENT.

21:48.007 --> 21:51.344
HAVING AMELIA
REALLY CHANGED ME.

21:51.376 --> 21:53.913
WHEN YOU BECOME A MOTHER,
YOUR ENTIRE PERSPECTIVE SHIFTS.

21:53.945 --> 21:55.615
YOU'LL SEE.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.984
A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSWOMAN
AND A MOTHER.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.554
THEY SAY WOMEN
CAN'T HAVE IT ALL.

22:01.586 --> 22:03.690
- WELL, THEY'RE WRONG.
- ( phone ringing )

22:03.722 --> 22:06.025
SEE, I LITERALLY HAVE IT ALL

22:06.058 --> 22:08.795
IN THIS BLACK HOLE OF A BAG.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.696
WELL, THANK YOU AGAIN
FOR YOUR TIME.

22:10.730 --> 22:11.998
I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY BUSY.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.834
NOT AT ALL
SAY HI TO AARON FOR ME.

22:19.905 --> 22:22.442
OH.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.546
( sighs )

22:32.884 --> 22:36.355
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

22:36.388 --> 22:38.490
UH, IT'S REALLY GOOD.

22:38.523 --> 22:41.693
IT IS, LIKE, SO GOOD.

22:41.728 --> 22:42.894
WHY ARE YOU TALKING LIKE THAT?

22:42.929 --> 22:45.832
( clears throat )
UH, LIKE WHAT?

22:45.865 --> 22:47.567
DID YOU HAVE ANY NOTES?

22:47.599 --> 22:49.602
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SPECIFIC.

22:49.634 --> 22:51.804
UNLESS YOU WANT
TO TAKE A LOOK AT--

22:51.837 --> 22:53.740
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING.

22:53.772 --> 22:55.775
YOU CAN SAY IT.

22:55.807 --> 22:57.576
I CAN'T.

22:57.609 --> 23:00.078
- WHY?
- YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE...

23:01.748 --> 23:04.650
- DANNY, TRUTH, RIGHT NOW.
- OKAY, IT SUCKS.

23:04.683 --> 23:07.886
THERE ARE HARDLY ANY DETAILS
FROM YOUR MEETING, NO QUOTES.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.622
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO THIS WOMAN IS.

23:09.654 --> 23:11.590
IT'S-- IT'S LIKE
YOU WEREN'T EVEN THERE.

23:11.624 --> 23:14.393
I BASICALLY WASN'T.

23:14.426 --> 23:16.729
I FORGOT TO RECORD
THE INTERVIEW.

23:18.163 --> 23:20.098
OH, MY GOD.

23:20.133 --> 23:22.000
CAN'T YOU JUST CALL
THE WOMAN BACK NOW
FOR QUOTES?

23:22.034 --> 23:25.704
EVEN IF I DID,
I STILL DON'T REMEMBER ENOUGH
TO MAKE IT HALFWAY COMPETENT.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.807
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO
AT THE STAFF MEETING TOMORROW?

23:27.839 --> 23:29.776
I'M GOING TO GET FIRED.

23:29.808 --> 23:31.943
NO, HE CAN'T FIRE YOU.
IT'S ILLEGAL.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.480
THANK YOU, THAT'S COMFORTING.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.652
I'M SORRY ABOUT GREER.

23:39.684 --> 23:41.953
THAT'S THE GREAT THING
ABOUT BEING BISEXUAL.

23:41.988 --> 23:44.022
YOU HAVE DOUBLE THE CHANCE
OF MEETING SOMEONE ELSE.

23:44.056 --> 23:46.792
THANKS, BUT IT DOESN'T
WORK THAT WAY.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.561
HEY, MISS MOPEY, COME ON.
LET'S SIT DOWN.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.197
- COME ON.
- I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE,
GRANDMA.

23:51.430 --> 23:55.167
UM, I'D STAY WITH YOU,
BUT I SHOULD REALLY
PRACTICE THIS SPEECH.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.737
- DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?
- NO, THANKS.

24:03.542 --> 24:08.446
TO THE MOST DEDICATED
PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGIST
I HAVE EVER MET.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.482
NEW ENGLAND IS LUCKY
TO HAVE HIM.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.484
IF I HAD MY WAY,
YOU'D COME WORK WITH ME

24:12.518 --> 24:14.487
AT THE WORLD HEALTH
ORGANIZATION.

24:14.519 --> 24:15.755
- TO GEORGE.
- All: TO GEORGE.

24:15.788 --> 24:16.989
I'LL SAY IT AGAIN.

24:17.022 --> 24:19.491
YOU ARE NOT GETTING ME
OUT TO SAN FRANCISCO.

24:19.525 --> 24:22.761
EARTHQUAKES TERRIFY ME
MORE THAN ANY ILLNESS
EVER COULD.

24:22.795 --> 24:25.730
- ( all laughing )
- YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
AROUND SPIDERS.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.500
COME ON, SARA.
THESE PEOPLE RESPECT ME.

24:28.534 --> 24:30.970
( all laughing )

24:44.584 --> 24:47.586
WOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

24:47.619 --> 24:48.887
THAT WIG IS PERFECT.

24:48.921 --> 24:51.590
I'D NEVER KNOW
UNLESS I WAS YOUR ONCOLOGIST.

24:51.624 --> 24:54.192
THANK YOU.
IT'S JUST SO ITCHY.

24:54.227 --> 24:56.828
IT'S ALL WORTH IT, THOUGH,
TO KEEP LOOKING NORMAL,

24:56.863 --> 24:58.564
OR NORMAL-ISH.

24:58.597 --> 25:01.701
ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES
COMPARED MY FACE TO
A PORCELAIN GEISHA DOLL.

25:01.733 --> 25:03.102
( laughs )
OKAY.

25:03.134 --> 25:04.703
I HAVE NEVER
HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE.

25:04.737 --> 25:07.173
I HOPE YOU'RE WRITING
THESE STORIES DOWN SOMEWHERE.

25:07.205 --> 25:09.141
I HAVE TO.
OTHERWISE I'LL
FORGET EVERYTHING.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.076
MY CHEMO BRAIN
ISN'T GOING AWAY.

25:11.109 --> 25:13.011
YET.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.914
- YET.
- THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
THAT YOU CAN DO

25:15.948 --> 25:17.916
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO REMEMBER
SOMETHING AND YOU CAN'T.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.885
- WHAT'S THAT?
- TRY AND FORGET IT.

25:19.919 --> 25:20.920
OOH.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.057
DRINK UP.
DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

25:27.826 --> 25:30.061
WHAT WAS THAT?
CHUG IT.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.936
MORE.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.673
( laughs )
GREAT.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.607
NOW TAKE THE WIG OFF.

25:42.642 --> 25:44.676
( chokes )
ARE YOU KIDDING?

25:44.710 --> 25:48.213
I BARELY SHOW MY FAMILY
WHAT MY HEAD LOOKS LIKE
RIGHT NOW.

25:48.247 --> 25:51.317
WELL, YOU SHOULD.
IT'S A BADGE OF HONOR,

25:51.549 --> 25:53.685
ESPECIALLY HERE.
I MEAN, LOOK AROUND YOU.

25:53.719 --> 25:56.255
IF THERE IS ONE PLACE
TO PULL A FULL MONTY,

25:56.288 --> 25:59.592
IT'S AT A PARTY
FULL OF ONCOLOGISTS.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.727
TRUST ME.

26:09.801 --> 26:12.637
LIKE ANY 24-YEAR-OLD,

26:12.672 --> 26:15.307
I THOUGHT I WAS INVINCIBLE.

26:15.340 --> 26:19.711
I THOUGHT THAT I COULD
WILL THE CANCER AWAY.

26:19.744 --> 26:23.082
GOOD THING GEORGE WOULDN'T
LET ME GET AWAY WITH THAT.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.718
EVERY TIME
I PUSHED HIM AWAY,

26:25.750 --> 26:27.886
HE CAME BACK.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.288
BECAUSE I NEEDED HELP.

26:30.323 --> 26:34.859
I DIDN'T WANT IT,
BUT I NEEDED IT.

26:34.894 --> 26:37.697
HE WOULDN'T LET ME
LIVE IN DENIAL.

26:37.730 --> 26:41.866
UM, I'M A WRITER
BY PROFESSION,

26:41.901 --> 26:44.202
BUT WHEN I WAS ASKED
TO GIVE THIS SPEECH TONIGHT,

26:44.236 --> 26:48.074
I HAD A REALLY HARD TIME
FINDING THE RIGHT WORDS

26:48.106 --> 26:50.343
TO DESCRIBE
MY FEELINGS FOR GEORGE,

26:50.375 --> 26:54.279
MY-- MY GRATITUDE.

26:54.313 --> 26:57.717
I OWE HIM MY LIFE.

26:59.785 --> 27:04.056
AND I AM SO PROUD THAT HE IS
BEING RECOGNIZED TONIGHT.

27:04.089 --> 27:08.760
I AM PROUD
TO HAVE BEEN HIS PATIENT

27:08.794 --> 27:13.365
AND EVEN PROUDER
TO BE HIS NIECE.

27:16.001 --> 27:17.970
THANK YOU.

27:26.945 --> 27:28.646
THANKS.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.982
I'M DIGGING
YOUR NEW LOOK.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.961
THANK YOU, APRIL.
THAT WAS-- THAT WAS
REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.330
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I'M OVERWHELMED

27:45.364 --> 27:47.400
BY ALL THIS ATTENTION.

27:47.432 --> 27:52.137
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT AN EXTROVERT BY NATURE.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.140
( chuckles )

27:54.173 --> 27:55.240
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- AH, THANKS.

27:55.273 --> 27:57.076
THANKS FOR COMING,
SUSAN.

27:57.108 --> 27:59.811
YOU THINK I'D MISS
SEEING GEORGE CARVER
ADDRESS A CROWD OF PEOPLE?

27:59.845 --> 28:01.146
I WAS SO NERVOUS.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.981
YEAH, IT SHOWED.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.116
I MEAN, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE RELATED TO APRIL.

28:05.151 --> 28:07.086
- HER SPEECH WAS SO ELOQUENT.
- YEAH.

28:07.118 --> 28:09.821
SHE'S PRETTY HARD
TO COMPETE WITH.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.824
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT--

28:11.856 --> 28:14.826
- WORKING WITH SICK KIDS
ALL THE TIME.
- OH.

28:14.859 --> 28:17.195
IT'S-- APRIL IS
MY YOUNGEST PATIENT,

28:17.229 --> 28:19.265
AND I HAVE TO SAY,
IT'S HARD

28:19.298 --> 28:20.699
TO TALK TO HER
SOMETIMES.

28:20.732 --> 28:24.135
SHE'S DEALING WITH FEARS
THAT SOMEBODY HER AGE

28:24.170 --> 28:25.871
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

28:25.904 --> 28:27.740
AND THEN LOOKING TO ME
FOR REASSURANCE

28:27.772 --> 28:29.174
THAT EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE OKAY, WHEN--

28:29.208 --> 28:33.078
WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
YEAH.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.747
I TELL HER THAT SHE IS.

28:34.779 --> 28:37.048
AND I BELIEVE
THAT SHE WILL BE OKAY.

28:37.083 --> 28:40.752
BUT I CAN'T CONTROL
WHAT HAPPENS.

28:41.953 --> 28:44.056
- I MEAN, YOU KNOW--
- I DO.

28:44.089 --> 28:46.192
YEAH.

28:46.224 --> 28:49.761
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT IT SEEMS TO BE
GETTING HARDER LATELY.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.268
YOU THINK IT'S TOO LATE
FOR US TO QUIT OUR JOBS

28:56.301 --> 28:57.936
- AND START A BAND?
- ( laughs )

28:57.970 --> 28:59.404
( both chuckling )

28:59.438 --> 29:01.106
- I'LL SEE YOU AT THE BAR.
- OKAY.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.852
I JUST GOT AN EMAIL
FROM OLIVIA ORTIZ.

29:12.884 --> 29:15.153
SHE'S COMING TO BOSTON

29:15.186 --> 29:18.124
WITH NATALIE TONIGHT.

29:28.134 --> 29:30.201
SPORTS, ARTS AND LEISURE,
FOOD AND DINING,

29:30.236 --> 29:33.105
AND OUR NEW AND MUCH-IMPROVED
AUTO SECTION ARE GOOD TO GO.

29:33.138 --> 29:36.407
SWEET IDEA ON THE NEWS GRAPHICS,
D-DOG.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.410
WHY DON'T WE ADD A PET SECTION
WHILE WE'RE AT IT?

29:38.443 --> 29:41.346
APRIL, WHEN WILL
THE HELENA PIECE BE READY?

29:41.380 --> 29:43.816
OH, UM...

29:43.848 --> 29:46.785
- ( sighs )
- SPEAK.

29:46.818 --> 29:49.355
I RAN INTO A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH MY VOICE RECORDER.

29:49.387 --> 29:50.823
AND THAT AFFECTS ME HOW?

29:50.855 --> 29:53.459
I DIDN'T GET THE INTERVIEW
ON TAPE.

29:56.362 --> 29:58.497
UH...

29:58.530 --> 29:59.498
Raquel:
IN MY PERSONAL OPINION,

29:59.531 --> 30:01.333
THIS IS A BLESSING.

30:01.366 --> 30:03.469
THAT PIECE SHOULD NEVER
HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

30:03.501 --> 30:05.938
THE "WOMEN HAVING IT ALL"
ARTICLE HAS BEEN DONE TO DEATH.

30:05.971 --> 30:09.441
IN FACT, "COSMO," "WOMEN'S DAY,"
"REDBOOK" AND "GLAMOUR"

30:09.474 --> 30:11.477
ARE RUNNING SIMILAR STORIES
THIS MONTH, JUST TO NAME A FEW.

30:11.509 --> 30:14.346
GUESS I HAVEN'T BEEN KEEPING UP
WITH MY "COSMO" AND "GLAMOUR."

30:14.380 --> 30:16.147
WELL, I MAKE IT A POINT
TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON

30:16.182 --> 30:17.383
IN THE WORLD OF JOURNALISM,

30:17.415 --> 30:19.317
BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
MY INDUSTRY.

30:19.351 --> 30:22.922
FINE, WE'LL RUN ANOTHER STORY.
LET'S MOVE ON.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.157
ANDRE, BRING ME UP TO SPEED

30:26.192 --> 30:28.894
ON THAT PIECE WITH
THE PATRIOTS' QUARTERBACK.

30:28.928 --> 30:32.330
RAQUEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SAVING MY ASS IN THERE.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.032
I WASN'T TRYING
TO SAVE YOUR ASS.

30:34.066 --> 30:36.902
- OH.
- I'M TRYING TO SAVE
THIS NEWSPAPER.

30:36.935 --> 30:40.005
AND I RESENT THAT I HAVE
TO ANSWER TO SOME ALPHA
START-UP GUY

30:40.038 --> 30:42.007
WHO'S NEVER EVEN WORKED
IN THIS BUSINESS BEFORE.

30:42.040 --> 30:45.911
YOU REALIZE HE'S GOING TO TURN
THIS PAPER INTO A TABLOID,
DON'T YOU?

30:45.944 --> 30:48.948
I SHOULD THANK YOU
FOR SCREWING UP THAT INTERVIEW.

30:48.980 --> 30:50.883
AT LEAST THAT BUYS
US SOME TIME.

30:54.953 --> 30:57.222
SO YOU'RE JUST GIVING UP?

30:57.256 --> 31:00.625
HER PARENTS DON'T LIKE YOU?
BIG DEAL.

31:00.858 --> 31:03.028
IT IS A BIG DEAL.

31:03.061 --> 31:06.332
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
SHE DOESN'T EVEN WANT
TO SEE ME.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.865
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

31:07.900 --> 31:10.368
SORRY.
( laughs )

31:10.402 --> 31:13.939
I CAN'T HELP IT.
BENEATH THIS CYNICAL VENEER,

31:13.972 --> 31:15.974
I'M A ROMANTIC.

31:16.008 --> 31:19.612
IT WORKED FOR ME.
I HAD TO WORK FOR WHAT I WANTED.

31:19.644 --> 31:20.980
WITH GRANDPA?

31:21.012 --> 31:23.648
HE TOOK SOME CONVINCING.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.585
WHEN WE FIRST MET
IN THE NAVY,

31:26.618 --> 31:29.087
I WAS HIS SUPERIOR.
HE WAS REPORTING TO ME.

31:29.121 --> 31:32.423
SO EVERYTHING HE SAID TO ME
WAS "YES, MA'AM. NO, MA'AM."

31:32.458 --> 31:35.560
THEN I'D SEE HIM AROUND
WITH HIS FRIENDS,

31:35.594 --> 31:37.563
MAKING JOKES AND LAUGHING,

31:37.596 --> 31:40.566
AND I COULD TELL WE HAD
THE SAME SENSE OF HUMOR.

31:40.598 --> 31:43.067
I KNEW HE WAS FOR ME.

31:43.102 --> 31:46.238
SO I JUST STARTED
MAKING JOKES AROUND HIM

31:46.271 --> 31:49.008
EVEN THOUGH HE KEPT RESPONDING,
"YES, MA'AM. NO MA'AM."

31:49.040 --> 31:52.010
UNTIL FINALLY AFTER A YEAR,

31:52.044 --> 31:54.078
HE MADE A JOKE BACK

31:54.113 --> 31:58.250
AND WE NEVER STOPPED JOKING
AFTER THAT.

31:58.284 --> 32:01.386
AND HE CONTINUED
REPORTING TO ME

32:01.420 --> 32:03.655
FOR THE NEXT 40 YEARS.

32:03.689 --> 32:06.392
SO THERE.

32:14.232 --> 32:15.667
HEY.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.368
HEY.

32:17.403 --> 32:20.605
WHY ARE YOU
TAKING THE STAIRS?

32:22.674 --> 32:25.009
WHY ARE YOU
TAKING THE STAIRS?

32:25.044 --> 32:27.680
I NEED TO BUILD
MY STRENGTH BACK.

32:27.712 --> 32:30.182
SO IT'S NOT TO AVOID ME?

32:30.214 --> 32:34.952
OKAY,
MAYBE A LITTLE.

32:34.987 --> 32:39.557
I JUST WANT THIS
TO STOP BEING AWKWARD.

32:39.590 --> 32:42.528
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE
IN THE SAME SPACE.

32:42.560 --> 32:46.030
CAN WE JUST MAKE A DEAL
AND CALL A TRUCE?

32:46.065 --> 32:48.133
BE FRIENDS?

32:50.068 --> 32:52.304
LOOK, APRIL, I COULDN'T
SAY THIS TO YOU BEFORE

32:52.337 --> 32:54.339
BECAUSE YOU WERE
IN THE HOSPITAL.

32:56.275 --> 32:59.644
YOU DON'T GET TO BE THE ONE
THAT CALLS A TRUCE.

32:59.677 --> 33:01.646
YOU CHEATED ON ME.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.982
YOU KEPT SECRETS
AND YOU LIED TO ME.

33:05.017 --> 33:08.519
AND YET I'M STILL THE BAD GUY
BECAUSE I DUMPED THE GIRL
WITH CANCER,

33:08.554 --> 33:11.089
EVEN THOUGH SHE BROKE MY HEART.

33:11.123 --> 33:15.661
SO NO,
I DON'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS.

33:25.770 --> 33:27.373
YOU OKAY, MOM?

33:27.405 --> 33:30.409
I'M FINE, HONEY.

33:30.442 --> 33:33.679
THIS IS ABOUT GETTING YOU
THE BEST MATCH POSSIBLE.
THAT'S IT.

33:33.711 --> 33:36.013
( doorbell rings )

33:37.715 --> 33:39.183
HERE WE GO.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.067
HELLO.

33:57.301 --> 33:59.771
UH, COME IN, PLEASE.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.179
HI.

34:07.211 --> 34:10.615
UM, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

34:10.648 --> 34:13.217
UH, COME SIT, PLEASE.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.764
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL HOME.

34:27.766 --> 34:30.302
IT MUST HAVE BEEN NICE
GROWING UP HERE.

34:30.335 --> 34:32.438
Sara: THANK YOU.

34:32.471 --> 34:35.306
THANK YOU BOTH FOR COMING
ALL THIS WAY.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.708
WOULD EITHER OF YOU CARE
FOR SOME TEA?

34:37.742 --> 34:39.311
- SURE.
- NO.

34:39.344 --> 34:40.778
THANKS.

34:42.847 --> 34:44.615
APRIL, HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

34:44.650 --> 34:46.751
I'M SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR ILLNESS.

34:46.784 --> 34:48.286
THANK YOU.

34:48.320 --> 34:52.324
UM, I'M IN REMISSION,
AT LEAST FOR NOW.

34:52.356 --> 34:53.724
THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

34:53.759 --> 34:57.596
IT IS, BUT AS I MENTIONED
IN MY EMAIL,

34:57.628 --> 34:59.630
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
THAT APRIL'S GOING TO NEED

34:59.664 --> 35:01.300
TO HAVE A BONE-MARROW
TRANSPLANT.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.768
AND MY OTHER DAUGHTER
IS NOT A MATCH.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.503
SO YOU THOUGHT OF NATALIE.

35:05.536 --> 35:08.507
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THAT WAS APRIL'S IDEA,

35:08.539 --> 35:10.775
BUT I SUGGESTED
WE CONTACT YOU.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.844
BECAUSE NOW YOU NEED SOMETHING.

35:12.878 --> 35:15.780
WELL, YES, IT'S TRUE

35:15.813 --> 35:19.384
THAT I'VE TRIED TO GIVE
YOU YOUR SPACE BEFORE NOW.

35:19.418 --> 35:22.521
AND YES, IT'S TRUE
WE DO NEED SOMETHING.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.556
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE DON'T APPRECIATE
YOU BEING HERE

35:24.590 --> 35:26.224
TO TALK ABOUT IT WITH US.

35:26.257 --> 35:28.693
( Sara sighs )

35:28.726 --> 35:30.128
IF THIS WERE HAPPENING
TO YOU,

35:30.161 --> 35:32.431
I IMAGINE YOU'D WANT
THE SAME FROM US.

35:32.463 --> 35:35.833
WHAT DOES THE TEST INVOLVE?

35:35.867 --> 35:38.369
( phone ringing )

35:38.402 --> 35:41.873
UM, I'M SORRY.
EXCUSE ME.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.541
IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.

35:43.574 --> 35:44.909
IT'S JUST A CHEEK SWAB.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.911
Sara: HELLO?

35:47.144 --> 35:48.547
YES, THIS IS SHE.

35:48.579 --> 35:50.748
WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT?

35:50.782 --> 35:52.784
NO. I-- I--

35:52.818 --> 35:55.320
OKAY, YES,
I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.623
YES.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.458
MOM, WHAT IS IT?

36:00.492 --> 36:03.762
BRENNA WAS JUST CAUGHT
BREAKING INTO GREER'S HOUSE.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.197
THE POLICE ARE THERE.

36:05.230 --> 36:07.900
OH, MY GOD.
CLASSIC.

36:07.932 --> 36:11.503
I'M VERY SORRY,
BUT I'VE GOT TO GO.

36:11.536 --> 36:14.773
SWEET.
I'M OUT OF HERE TOO.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.775
NATALIE, WAIT.

36:16.807 --> 36:19.177
I'M SORRY.

36:27.585 --> 36:29.221
Female officer:
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO PRESS CHARGES?

36:29.253 --> 36:30.289
WAIT, PRESS CHARGES?

36:30.322 --> 36:32.523
SHE'S A KID
WHO MADE A BAD DECISION.

36:32.557 --> 36:33.791
SHE'S NOT A CRIMINAL.

36:33.824 --> 36:36.894
LAST I CHECKED,
BREAKING AND ENTERING
IS A CRIME.

36:36.929 --> 36:40.498
OKAY, SHE CLIMBED YOUR TRELLIS.
SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY BREAK
INTO YOUR HOUSE.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.534
MA'AM, PLEASE,
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

36:42.568 --> 36:45.336
SHE WOULD HAVE
IF SECURITY HADN'T SHOWN UP.

36:45.369 --> 36:47.405
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT

36:47.438 --> 36:49.641
WHEN WE DECIDED THE GIRLS
SHOULD STOP SEEING EACH OTHER.

36:49.675 --> 36:52.344
OFFICER, I THINK
WE WOULD LIKE TO--

36:52.376 --> 36:55.246
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO PRESS CHARGES, OFFICER,

36:55.280 --> 36:56.914
BUT THANK YOU.

36:56.949 --> 36:59.251
HAVE A GOOD EVENING,
FOLKS.

37:00.686 --> 37:02.721
CONSIDER THIS A WARNING.

37:02.753 --> 37:04.922
IF BRENNA PULLS
ANOTHER STUNT LIKE THIS,

37:04.956 --> 37:07.693
NEXT TIME
WE WON'T BE SO GENEROUS.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.360
DON'T WORRY, SHE WON'T.

37:09.393 --> 37:11.896
I DON'T WANT HER
ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR FAMILY.

37:11.929 --> 37:14.599
- MOM.
- WE'RE LEAVING.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.336
BRENNA, NOW.

37:26.277 --> 37:28.947
Sara:
BRENNA IS SO MAD AT ME
RIGHT NOW.

37:28.981 --> 37:30.748
WHAT WAS--
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

37:30.782 --> 37:32.016
THOSE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.753
HOW CAN I POSSIBLY CONDONE
HER SEEING GREER AGAIN?

37:34.786 --> 37:36.655
YOU JUST HAVE TO
LET BRENNA COOL OFF.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.757
THAT'S ALL.
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN
DO TONIGHT.

37:38.789 --> 37:40.626
JUST TRY NOT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.994
WHAT SHOULD I THINK ABOUT?
NATALIE AND OLIVIA,

37:43.027 --> 37:45.530
WHO I'M ALREADY DREADING
HAVING TO SEE AGAIN TOMORROW?

37:45.563 --> 37:49.266
WELL, IT'S-- THINGS WILL
WORK THEMSELVES OUT.

37:49.300 --> 37:53.338
NOW JUST TRY TO RELAX,
OKAY?

37:53.371 --> 37:55.773
( both chuckle )

37:56.842 --> 37:58.577
THANK YOU.

38:04.483 --> 38:05.717
OH, NO.

38:05.751 --> 38:09.721
NO NO NO.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.657
MOM, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE AT A MOVIE.

38:11.690 --> 38:12.858
I LEFT EARLY,

38:12.891 --> 38:15.693
APPARENTLY FOR A MUCH MORE
INTERESTING SHOW.

38:20.766 --> 38:22.701
( knocking )

38:25.403 --> 38:27.539
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T USE
THE FRONT DOOR.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.740
I KNOW IT SOUNDS SILLY,

38:29.775 --> 38:31.677
BUT I BELIEVE IF YOU WANT
TO DO THINGS OVER,

38:31.710 --> 38:33.978
YOU NEED TO CHANGE EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOUR APPROACH.

38:34.012 --> 38:36.380
THEY'RE PEONIES.

38:36.414 --> 38:38.717
THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO REPRESENT HEALING.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.588
CAN I COME IN?

38:44.623 --> 38:47.893
YES, PLEASE.

38:56.735 --> 39:00.806
I'M SORRY ABOUT
NATALIE'S BEHAVIOR LAST NIGHT.

39:00.838 --> 39:05.677
BUT COMING HERE--
IT WASN'T EASY FOR HER,

39:07.079 --> 39:10.081
- FOR EITHER ONE OF US.
- April: WE GET THAT.

39:10.114 --> 39:13.652
AND IT WASN'T
EASY TO ASK.

39:13.684 --> 39:16.922
- I KNOW THINGS ARE--
- THINGS ARE WHAT THEY ARE.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.925
BUT YOU'LL BE GLAD TO KNOW

39:20.958 --> 39:23.829
THAT NATALIE AGREED
TO DO THE TEST.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.996
( both sigh )

39:26.030 --> 39:27.766
I HAD TO DO
A LITTLE CONVINCING,

39:27.798 --> 39:30.101
BUT LIKE YOU SAID, IF--

39:30.135 --> 39:32.036
IF THIS WAS HAPPENING
TO HER,

39:32.070 --> 39:33.972
I'D BE ASKING
THE SAME OF YOU.

39:34.005 --> 39:36.807
I UNDERSTAND
THE POSITION YOU'RE IN.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.876
- I APPRECIATE THAT.
- ME TOO.

39:38.909 --> 39:42.614
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL LATER
TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS.

39:42.646 --> 39:44.916
THANK YOU.

39:47.652 --> 39:49.788
( door opens, closes )

39:49.820 --> 39:51.757
( sighs )

39:51.789 --> 39:54.126
THANK GOD.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.894
THANK YOU.

39:57.762 --> 40:00.831
I KNOW HOW HARD
THIS WAS FOR YOU.

40:00.865 --> 40:02.833
HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

40:02.867 --> 40:05.771
I WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR YOU.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.838
YOU KNOW THAT.

40:16.181 --> 40:17.849
( exhaling )

40:20.786 --> 40:24.523
IT'S, LIKE, REALLY HARD
WALKING IN SLOW-MO.

40:24.556 --> 40:25.791
SHUT UP.

40:25.824 --> 40:28.726
I'M GLAD YOU DITCHED THE WIG,
BY THE WAY.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.061
YOU LOOKED LIKE STEPFORD APRIL.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.697
YOU TELL ME THIS AFTER
I WORE IT TO WORK FOR A WEEK?

40:32.731 --> 40:35.065
LIKE I WAS GOING
TO TELL YOU THAT
YOUR FIRST WEEK BACK.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.168
PLEASE,
I'M NOT THAT INSENSITIVE.

40:37.202 --> 40:38.702
YES, YOU ARE.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.771
YES, I AM.

40:40.806 --> 40:43.074
( phone ringing )

40:43.108 --> 40:45.476
IT'S MY DOCTOR.

40:45.510 --> 40:48.112
SHE SAID I WAS IN REMISSION.
SOMETHING MUST BE WRONG.

40:48.146 --> 40:50.148
DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.

40:50.181 --> 40:51.983
( sighs )

40:52.016 --> 40:54.652
HELLO?

40:57.521 --> 40:59.958
April:
I THOUGHT YOU SAID HE WAS--

40:59.990 --> 41:02.193
HE WAS LUCID YESTERDAY
FOR AN HOUR.

41:02.226 --> 41:05.063
AND HE TRIED TO SPEAK
ABOUT 40 MINUTES AGO.

41:05.096 --> 41:07.097
IT'S A GOOD SIGN.

41:07.132 --> 41:10.001
- TALK TO HIM.
- ( classical music playing )

41:14.039 --> 41:16.173
HEY.

41:16.208 --> 41:18.143
IT'S ME.

41:18.175 --> 41:22.146
WORD ON THE STREET
IS YOU ARE WAKING UP.

41:22.179 --> 41:25.115
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HAPPY I WAS
TO GET THAT CALL.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.552
I CAN'T RUN YET,

41:27.585 --> 41:29.954
BUT I--
I WALKED REALLY FAST...

41:29.987 --> 41:31.722
FOR ME,

41:31.755 --> 41:34.592
WHICH MEANS ONLY
THE 50-YEAR-OLDS PASSED ME.

41:38.829 --> 41:42.567
UM, LET'S SEE.

41:42.601 --> 41:45.570
OH, REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
ABOUT NATALIE AND OLIVIA?

41:45.603 --> 41:47.938
WELL, NATALIE HAS AGREED
TO GET TESTED TO SEE

41:47.972 --> 41:49.807
IF SHE'S A HALF MATCH
FOR ME.

41:49.840 --> 41:53.811
OH, THIS GIRL
IS A REAL PIECE OF WORK.

41:53.844 --> 41:57.916
SHE'S A--
SEEMS KIND OF NUTS, HONESTLY.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.851
( softly )
THAT RUNS IN YOUR FAMILY.

42:01.018 --> 42:03.989
DID YOU REALLY JUST SAY THAT?

42:07.692 --> 42:08.893
YEAH.

42:08.927 --> 42:11.929
OH, MY GOD.

42:11.963 --> 42:13.030
LEO.

42:14.932 --> 42:18.003
WHO IS LEO?

42:21.106 --> 42:22.539
KIDDING.

42:26.911 --> 42:30.148
SO...

42:30.181 --> 42:33.585
WE'RE ALIVE.

42:33.617 --> 42:36.054
NOW WHAT?
