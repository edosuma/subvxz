WEBVTT

00:11.122 --> 00:12.404
Every event we attend,

00:12.406 --> 00:14.156
we build favor equity with Flaherty.

00:14.208 --> 00:15.658
His reach is far beyond basketball.

00:15.710 --> 00:17.326
We wanna tap into that reach.

00:17.378 --> 00:19.495
Jupiter Blackmon wants
me to be his manager.

00:19.547 --> 00:21.997
Top-10 pick in the NFL
draft, and he wants me.

00:22.049 --> 00:23.249
My name is Isa.

00:25.753 --> 00:27.336
You looking for an interview?

00:27.388 --> 00:29.221
- We need to talk.
- You all right?

00:29.257 --> 00:32.341
There is no good way
to say this. I have HPV.

00:32.393 --> 00:34.059
I don't know what to say.

00:34.095 --> 00:35.845
I'm telling you, this girl is special.

00:35.897 --> 00:37.730
Okay, she gonna find out who
you are eventually anyway,

00:37.765 --> 00:39.481
and she'll either like it or she won't.

00:39.517 --> 00:42.685
A few weeks ago, I realized why
I started playing basketball.

00:42.737 --> 00:43.736
Because you were good at it.

00:43.771 --> 00:46.405
No. To meet you.

00:49.277 --> 00:51.410
Ooh, say more, baby.

00:51.445 --> 00:54.246
The three characteristics
of German Romanticism

00:54.282 --> 00:58.500
are Streben, Das Ganze,
and EigentÃ¼mlichkeit.

00:58.536 --> 01:00.336
Germans. Uh-uh, baby.

01:00.371 --> 01:03.789
Uh, Oswald could not have acted alone.

01:03.791 --> 01:04.956
Ooh, not a chance.

01:06.627 --> 01:10.629
- Delta G is equal to Delta H...
- Uh-huh.

01:10.631 --> 01:15.801
minus the quantity of T minus Delta X!

01:17.471 --> 01:19.438
Oh, shit, babe!

01:25.279 --> 01:27.780
Science always finishes me.

01:27.815 --> 01:30.399
I know. I got you all mapped out.

01:30.451 --> 01:32.985
Yes, you do. And I love your glasses.

01:33.037 --> 01:34.987
I wanna fuck you in a library.

01:35.039 --> 01:36.572
There are no more libraries.

01:36.624 --> 01:38.290
You have to fuck me in a wiki.

01:40.044 --> 01:41.243
Who the fuck is that?

01:42.496 --> 01:46.048
Oh, shit. Okay.

01:53.674 --> 01:56.175
- This is Reggie.
- It's the man of your dreams.

01:56.177 --> 01:58.260
To what do I owe?

01:58.312 --> 02:00.179
Don't be so fuckin' negative.

02:00.181 --> 02:03.349
The presence of your company is
requested at my home this evening

02:03.401 --> 02:05.351
for a game of guts. Are you familiar?

02:05.353 --> 02:07.519
Uh, yeah. I may have played once or twice.

02:07.571 --> 02:09.154
Good. 100K buy-in.

02:09.190 --> 02:10.906
We go until the first billionaire cries

02:10.942 --> 02:13.075
or, more likely, until
one of us takes your house,

02:13.110 --> 02:14.777
which we can use as a tool shed.

02:14.829 --> 02:16.362
7:30, having had.

02:16.414 --> 02:18.530
Casual but neat, which means take it easy

02:18.532 --> 02:20.532
on the hip-hop fashion sensibilities.

02:20.584 --> 02:22.368
Although you should wear a diamond necklace

02:22.370 --> 02:23.786
in case you need to bet it.

02:23.838 --> 02:25.170
It would help if the diamonds were real.

02:25.206 --> 02:28.340
Okay, thank you. I will be there.

02:28.376 --> 02:30.009
Laura will be in touch.
She'll give you a call

02:30.044 --> 02:32.044
with the address and the
parking protocol, okay?

02:32.096 --> 02:33.629
Hasta.

02:37.018 --> 02:38.884
Shit. Laura!

02:38.886 --> 02:41.520
- Huh.
- Jupiter's getting mail here now?

02:41.555 --> 02:43.522
Oh, yeah. It'll be checks soon enough.

02:43.557 --> 02:45.024
What is the Wonderlic test?

02:45.045 --> 02:50.635
Just a basic IQ test given to the
draft, especially the uh, quarterbacks.

02:50.641 --> 02:51.760
Well, why do they do that?

02:51.790 --> 02:54.616
Well, it used to be an excuse to make
sure white boys played quarterback.

02:54.652 --> 02:56.910
But the brothers caught on.

02:56.935 --> 02:59.685
Well, having met Jupiter, I
hope it doesn't count for much.

02:59.686 --> 03:01.340
Oh, it all counts, baby.

03:01.341 --> 03:02.770
It all counts.

03:02.771 --> 03:03.545
You know, I gotta get him a tutor.

03:03.639 --> 03:05.456
Or maybe a prep class.

03:05.557 --> 03:06.457
Or something.

03:06.492 --> 03:07.858
I could do it.

03:07.860 --> 03:10.513
Missy, his score is gonna
be what his score is.

03:10.514 --> 03:12.800
Jupiter will get drafted
on his college record

03:12.801 --> 03:14.090
and his intangibles.

03:14.091 --> 03:16.604
But if his IQ is higher than expected,

03:16.605 --> 03:17.880
doesn't that mean more money?

03:18.675 --> 03:20.785
Don't you go arousing me again. I gotta go.

03:22.627 --> 03:25.126
All right, you know what?
You want the gig, it's yours.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.301
You can start tonight. I'll
have Uncle Julius bring him over.

03:27.302 --> 03:28.405
This will be fun.

03:28.534 --> 03:31.450
I doubt it. But any case, no glasses.

03:31.451 --> 03:33.151
Kid's horny enough.

03:33.893 --> 03:37.605
I will get him to an
eighth-grade level, no problem.

03:37.606 --> 03:40.260
Baby, he went to Georgia Tech
on a football scholarship,

03:40.362 --> 03:42.813
don't be so ambitious. Hmm?

03:44.149 --> 03:47.017
I gotta go. I gotta go.

03:47.069 --> 03:49.269
Zip yourself.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.770
You put on some panties.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.948
Yeah, this is the one. Thanks.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.283
Don't spill on it.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.118
That's Purple Label right there.

04:05.170 --> 04:07.120
He ever borrow a tie from you before?

04:07.172 --> 04:08.955
Not one time.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.757
That's when you know a
man's in deep with his woman,

04:10.792 --> 04:13.293
when he starts to doubt
his own accessories.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.628
Putting my best foot forward.

04:14.680 --> 04:15.962
No, you putting my best foot forward.

04:16.014 --> 04:17.264
Be careful with that necktie.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.599
Yeah, yeah, man. Purple Label, I know.

04:19.635 --> 04:22.302
Why you wanna set up some
gussied-up version of yourself

04:22.304 --> 04:23.970
in the beginning of a relationship?

04:24.022 --> 04:25.605
I believe that the idea
is to capture a heart

04:25.641 --> 04:28.475
with the good news before
revealing the horrible news.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.809
Well, that's deceptive.

04:29.862 --> 04:31.645
I mean, the real you
gonna leak out eventually.

04:31.697 --> 04:33.396
And maybe when it does,

04:33.448 --> 04:35.398
you two can pump the brakes
on your whirlwind romance?

04:35.450 --> 04:39.236
Nope. We are two peas in a pod,
and you just jealous, Reggie.

04:39.288 --> 04:41.488
A woman don't really know a man

04:41.490 --> 04:42.956
until she smells his farts.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.075
Which she will in 2023.

04:45.127 --> 04:46.660
That's just medically unsafe.

04:46.662 --> 04:48.128
You can rip one if you want to, baby.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.663
No, no. I shouldn't.

04:49.715 --> 04:52.465
I can, and I would love
to, but I shouldn't.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.084
Just give me a heads up
so I can leave the room.

04:54.136 --> 04:56.503
- You should leave the room.
- You can rip on cue?

04:56.505 --> 04:58.672
I went to prep school in
Belgium. Of course I can.

04:58.724 --> 05:00.257
Okay, waffles, I know.

05:00.309 --> 05:02.342
Farting on cue, I'm unfamiliar with

05:02.394 --> 05:04.644
as a specifically Belgian skill.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.849
See, now you in a honest relationship.

05:09.851 --> 05:12.400
- Oh, man.
- What is it, Chinese New Year?

05:12.558 --> 05:14.308
Yeah, Belgium, too.

05:14.343 --> 05:15.643
I feel inexpressibly better.

05:15.678 --> 05:18.229
Yeah, and you smell inexpressibly bad.

05:18.264 --> 05:19.680
Hey, we got 22 rooms in this house.

05:19.732 --> 05:21.348
Why's everybody always in here?

05:21.400 --> 05:23.684
Studies have shown people
go wherever the food's at.

05:23.686 --> 05:24.852
It smells good in here. What is that?

05:24.904 --> 05:26.020
My boo.

05:26.072 --> 05:27.521
Oh! This family. I swear it.

05:28.858 --> 05:31.575
Holy shit. Did you just transfer 250K?

05:31.611 --> 05:32.826
You got 22 rooms in this house.

05:32.862 --> 05:34.278
Why's everybody always in here?

05:34.330 --> 05:35.663
- Keep it moving.
- Oh. Ow.

05:35.698 --> 05:37.448
You finally getting a real fuckin' watch?

05:37.500 --> 05:38.782
Nah, I'm playing guts in Flaherty's game.

05:38.834 --> 05:39.833
Hey, that's a big-boy table.

05:39.869 --> 05:41.869
I got no choice but to accept.

05:41.871 --> 05:44.505
True. The American ruling class
has granted you an interview.

05:44.540 --> 05:46.790
To say no would be a colossal blunder.

05:46.842 --> 05:48.375
You know, that's not a level field.

05:48.427 --> 05:51.128
I mean, those guys got 250K
just lost in their couch.

05:51.180 --> 05:52.379
Rock, meet hard place.

05:52.381 --> 05:54.181
Hard place, I believe you know rock.

05:54.216 --> 05:56.300
Ooh. Gotta take a shit.

05:56.352 --> 05:58.719
She's like an orchid.

05:58.721 --> 06:00.721
Every big career comes down

06:00.773 --> 06:03.390
to a few defining moments of extreme risk.

06:03.442 --> 06:05.225
You have to go all in
on something sometime.

06:05.227 --> 06:06.894
Do you ever play with Jimmy's bunch?

06:06.896 --> 06:08.896
If you're asking if I
have cradled his balls,

06:08.898 --> 06:10.114
the answer is no.

06:10.149 --> 06:11.448
I wasn't. But glad.

06:11.484 --> 06:13.117
I play my guts in Macau.

06:13.152 --> 06:16.070
Quarter million US won't
even get you in the door.

06:16.072 --> 06:17.905
Ooh, but watch out for that Tom Werner.

06:17.957 --> 06:19.740
He would take your underpants.

06:19.742 --> 06:21.792
All right, I need some quiet
and a legit fucking mirror.

06:21.827 --> 06:23.377
Keep your cool tonight, Reg.

06:23.412 --> 06:25.462
It ain't important whether
you winning or losing.

06:25.498 --> 06:28.248
Although if you wanna keep your
marriage, winning is better.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.466
Damn, don't tighten up on the boy.

06:29.502 --> 06:31.418
He can't think money is money.

06:31.420 --> 06:33.253
He's gotta play his hand right
or they gonna think he's soft.

06:33.306 --> 06:34.555
Your uncle is correct.

06:34.590 --> 06:36.256
What counts is how you handle yourself.

06:36.258 --> 06:39.259
Are you poised? Can you meet
with triumph and disaster

06:39.261 --> 06:42.229
and treat those two
imposters just the same?

06:42.264 --> 06:44.264
Your name will be made or
destroyed tonight, Reggie.

06:44.317 --> 06:46.266
Have a nice time.

06:46.268 --> 06:47.735
Well, I'll be damned.

06:47.770 --> 06:51.772
God, I fuckin' love you.
Come here. Come here.

06:51.824 --> 06:53.657
Excuse me.

06:57.330 --> 06:58.862
Hey.

06:58.914 --> 07:01.198
Why you make your necktie
six hours before your date?

07:01.250 --> 07:02.783
Dry run.

07:02.835 --> 07:04.618
Will you just get naked
with this girl already

07:04.620 --> 07:07.171
so you can see she's just
the same as any other girl?

07:07.206 --> 07:09.840
We'll see what she says when I
tell her about my poison dick.

07:09.875 --> 07:11.458
You ain't got a poison dick.

07:11.460 --> 07:14.845
It's just a harmless,
nuisance strain of HPV.

07:18.634 --> 07:21.301
- You got HPV?
- You were dumping in my bathroom?

07:21.354 --> 07:22.636
You got the heated toilet seat.

07:22.688 --> 07:24.138
It's 85 degrees outside.

07:24.190 --> 07:26.106
Trust me, if I'd have known you had HPV,

07:26.142 --> 07:28.142
- I'd have used my own bathroom.
- You can't get it that way.

07:28.194 --> 07:30.027
Who are you? George Washington
Carver? You don't know.

07:30.062 --> 07:31.695
He does, and you can't.

07:31.731 --> 07:34.148
Just the same, from now on,
it's my own cold-ass seat.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.150
I ain't getting HPV from my brother.

07:36.202 --> 07:38.285
Though I can't think of
anything more Southern.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.487
How big a house do I need
to get a little privacy?

07:40.539 --> 07:43.490
Hey, relax. We are family.

07:43.542 --> 07:45.709
Nothing pierces that veil
and nothing leaks out.

07:45.745 --> 07:47.327
- Thank you.
- Reggie's got a point.

07:47.329 --> 07:49.246
You never know a girl until
you get naked with her.

07:49.298 --> 07:50.998
How do you know you can trust
her with this information?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.082
It's called believing in people.

07:52.134 --> 07:53.634
Dear God.

07:53.669 --> 07:56.470
Baby brother Cam, you are famous.

07:56.505 --> 07:58.172
Thing goes bad, one tweet,

07:58.224 --> 08:00.007
you could be globally embarrassed.

08:00.059 --> 08:01.258
Well, that's a chance
that I'm willing to take.

08:01.310 --> 08:03.677
Dude, we are talking about your brand.

08:03.729 --> 08:05.429
Your brand ain't got no poison dick.

08:05.481 --> 08:07.598
Does it say anything about a
poison dick on your billboards?

08:07.650 --> 08:09.767
- No, it does not.
- You said it wasn't a poison dick.

08:09.819 --> 08:11.185
It was the heat of the moment.

08:11.187 --> 08:12.569
But when you boil it down, you do.

08:12.605 --> 08:14.188
I wanna be in a
relationship with this girl.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.690
You cannot build a relationship off a lie.

08:16.692 --> 08:20.194
It ain't a lie. It's a skipped
over, insignificant detail.

08:20.246 --> 08:22.196
Does shit like that really
sound good in your head?

08:22.198 --> 08:24.198
Allison is a medical professional.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.750
She knows every time she sleeps
with somebody in today's world,

08:26.786 --> 08:28.168
she's rolling the dice.

08:28.204 --> 08:29.703
Knowing it ain't the same as hearing it.

08:29.705 --> 08:31.672
Yeah, but hearing it
means you might lose her.

08:31.707 --> 08:33.841
If you were her, wouldn't you
want a dude to look you in your eye

08:33.876 --> 08:35.042
and tell you what you needed to know?

08:35.094 --> 08:37.094
Yes, I would, if I needed to know it.

08:37.129 --> 08:38.846
- But she don't.
- She do.

08:38.881 --> 08:41.548
Yeah, everybody deserves
that kind of respect.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.183
- Significant or not.
- That's a lot of talkin'.

08:44.220 --> 08:46.386
I wanna be with her. And
I don't want any secrets.

08:46.388 --> 08:49.056
Look, when 80% of the world has
something, it's not a secret.

08:49.058 --> 08:51.225
It's like telling her you have hair.

08:51.227 --> 08:54.394
I'm gonna say something to y'all that
I thought you would have realized.

08:54.396 --> 08:56.063
That night when your phones were off

08:56.065 --> 08:58.198
and you were in Denver
with that clown quarterback,

08:58.234 --> 08:59.566
do you know what I was thinking about?

08:59.618 --> 09:01.401
A life without basketball,

09:01.403 --> 09:03.654
because that's what I
thought I would be living.

09:03.706 --> 09:06.623
I had no idea what it would look like,

09:06.659 --> 09:08.575
and then I saw Allison's face.

09:08.577 --> 09:10.294
Now, I was lucky that time.

09:10.329 --> 09:12.129
Not only because of my knee.

09:12.164 --> 09:13.664
I was handed the keys to the kingdom.

09:13.716 --> 09:16.750
But someday down the road,
I won't be that lucky.

09:16.802 --> 09:18.418
It really will be the end.

09:18.420 --> 09:21.305
And on that day, there's
only gonna be one question.

09:21.340 --> 09:23.257
Where are my keys?

09:23.309 --> 09:26.426
Wait, 20% of the world
doesn't have hair? Just...

09:26.479 --> 09:29.596
I wanna be an honest man,
carry myself with honor.

09:29.598 --> 09:31.315
It starts tonight.

09:31.350 --> 09:33.600
And if she's not into me
because of what I have to say,

09:33.602 --> 09:35.569
I can live with that.

09:40.276 --> 09:42.993
Wash your hands.

09:46.866 --> 09:50.667
So I thought we'd begin by
taking a practice Wonderlic test

09:50.703 --> 09:52.953
so that we can establish a baseline,

09:52.955 --> 09:55.005
a kind of starting-out point,

09:55.040 --> 09:57.341
and we can then chart your progress, okay?

09:57.376 --> 09:58.926
I'm nervous. Can I smoke a bowl first?

09:58.961 --> 10:00.177
Uh, hear, hear.

10:00.212 --> 10:02.763
Uh, no, you cannot smoke a bowl.

10:02.798 --> 10:05.432
You need to simulate the
situation you'll be in

10:05.467 --> 10:07.217
when you actually take the test.

10:07.269 --> 10:09.303
Well, I plan on smoking
a bowl before I take it.

10:09.305 --> 10:11.889
- That's smart thinking.
- I just perform so much better when I'm high.

10:11.941 --> 10:13.974
I got that shit that killed
Michael Jackson. I got the...

10:15.311 --> 10:17.144
I just heard this thing is hard as shit.

10:17.196 --> 10:19.563
I thought that you would
be nervous, Jupiter,

10:19.615 --> 10:21.815
which is why I'm taking it, too.

10:21.817 --> 10:24.234
We will get through this together.

10:27.156 --> 10:29.790
We have three minutes and 36 seconds

10:29.825 --> 10:31.825
to answer 15 questions.

10:31.877 --> 10:33.243
You think you can do that?

10:33.295 --> 10:36.964
Do I, uh, say my answers out loud?

10:36.999 --> 10:38.882
Do you what?

10:38.918 --> 10:40.667
Uh, no, no.

10:40.669 --> 10:44.087
You... you just circle
the answer on the paper.

10:44.139 --> 10:47.724
Question one, circle. Question two, circle.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.226
Uh, I got a question.

10:49.261 --> 10:51.345
How do you feel about
undrafted free agency?

10:51.347 --> 10:53.397
Start the clock, please, Julius.

10:53.432 --> 10:56.567
Omaha, Omaha, hut!

11:02.107 --> 11:04.191
"Jenny can take either of two family cars

11:04.193 --> 11:07.327
from Detroit to Traverse
City, a journey of 255 miles.

11:07.363 --> 11:09.696
Her red car gets 19 miles to the gallon

11:09.698 --> 11:11.498
and her white car gets 22,

11:11.533 --> 11:13.500
but her white car uses one cent of oil

11:13.535 --> 11:15.702
for every 15 miles it's driven

11:15.754 --> 11:19.122
and requires premium gas,
which is 10 cents a gallon more

11:19.174 --> 11:21.174
than the regular gas her white car uses.

11:21.210 --> 11:23.126
Which car will be less
expensive for the journey?"

11:23.178 --> 11:25.212
What the fuck?

11:25.214 --> 11:26.847
Three minutes, 10 seconds!

11:26.882 --> 11:28.632
Thank you.

11:30.886 --> 11:32.386
Three minute!

11:32.438 --> 11:34.304
Once a minute will be fine, Julius.

11:34.356 --> 11:36.390
My bad. Standing down.

11:36.442 --> 11:38.525
Two minutes, 55 seconds.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:52.741 --> 11:54.324
Welcome to the Flaherty
residence, Mr. Vaughn.

11:54.376 --> 11:55.826
Thank you.

11:55.878 --> 11:57.411
Okay if I give the Kia
a wash while you're here?

11:57.413 --> 11:58.996
Nah. No, no, no, it won't be necessary.

11:59.048 --> 12:02.132
- I'd feel better.
- Okay.

12:02.167 --> 12:03.717
Laura will direct you to the card room.

12:03.752 --> 12:04.918
Right. There you go.

12:04.970 --> 12:06.219
Thank you, sir. Enjoy your time.

12:06.255 --> 12:09.890
Okay, yeah, yeah. Just, uh... okay.

12:18.233 --> 12:20.233
Pencils down!

12:20.269 --> 12:22.769
Pencils down, bitch.

12:22.821 --> 12:25.105
Uh, no disrespect, but you
a cheatin' motherfucker.

12:25.157 --> 12:27.024
Let's see what it is and what it ain't.

12:27.076 --> 12:29.443
- Welcome to the Flaherty residence.
- Thank you.

12:29.495 --> 12:31.244
May I ask your drink of choice, Mr. Vaughn?

12:31.280 --> 12:33.413
I will take a Ciroc on the rocks, please.

12:33.449 --> 12:34.781
It'll meet you in the card room.

12:34.783 --> 12:36.083
Make a right at the samovar.

12:36.118 --> 12:38.452
All right. Thank you.

12:38.454 --> 12:40.954
What the fuck is a samovar?

12:41.076 --> 12:42.526
Reggie.

12:42.528 --> 12:44.611
Chen, what... what are you doing here?

12:44.663 --> 12:46.530
Cassie prevailed upon
me to watch your back,

12:46.582 --> 12:47.948
so I sent Jimmy a text.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.199
Ah, she shouldn't have done that.

12:49.201 --> 12:50.700
Your aunt loves you.

12:50.702 --> 12:53.086
She realizes that you
are up against enemies

12:53.122 --> 12:55.088
with far superior war chests.

12:55.124 --> 12:58.041
In this company, you are a tomato can.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.710
A veal boy, feet dangling from the floor,

13:00.712 --> 13:03.430
sucking down a fatty diet
and awaiting slaughter.

13:03.465 --> 13:05.432
I'll be all right.

13:05.467 --> 13:06.716
Do you want to be in league?

13:06.769 --> 13:08.051
You mean cheat?

13:08.053 --> 13:10.520
I mean protect yourself.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.272
From remorseless hoarders of wealth

13:12.307 --> 13:13.774
who will crush you between their fingers

13:13.809 --> 13:15.725
like a grain of puffed rice.

13:15.727 --> 13:17.694
Do you ever just answer a
question with a yes or a no?

13:17.729 --> 13:19.446
- Seldom.
- For fuck's sake.

13:19.481 --> 13:22.232
I'm not a child. I don't
need anybody looking after me.

13:22.234 --> 13:24.484
I like this phrase, "For
fuck's sake." What does it mean?

13:24.536 --> 13:26.403
It means that I shouldn't
have to say some shit,

13:26.405 --> 13:30.240
that you and any human being above
the age of seven should just know.

13:30.292 --> 13:31.708
I'm not cheating. I'll be fine.

13:31.743 --> 13:33.577
It will remain our secret, for fuck's sake.

13:33.629 --> 13:37.080
Chen, I appreciate you. I do. But no.

13:37.132 --> 13:38.748
We should have carpooled, for fuck's sake.

13:38.801 --> 13:40.333
Okay, you're overusing it now.

13:40.385 --> 13:41.918
Copy you.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.671
Hey, there he is. Boys, greet the new meat.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.423
Jimmy.

13:46.425 --> 13:48.892
Reggie Vaughn, this is Tom
Werner, rich from baseball and TV.

13:48.927 --> 13:50.594
- Hey, how you doing?
- And rich from playing cards.

13:50.596 --> 13:52.429
Hey, I'm from Dorchester. Big Red Sox fan.

13:52.431 --> 13:53.730
Smart man.

13:53.765 --> 13:55.015
And you may have heard of LeBron James.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.766
No idea who this guy is.

13:56.768 --> 13:58.351
- Reggie, what's up, man?
- What's up, man?

13:58.403 --> 13:59.936
I didn't know you was gonna be here.

13:59.938 --> 14:01.655
Yeah, you know, I just been
concentrating on my day job.

14:01.690 --> 14:03.073
See, that is exactly why you
are the best player in the world.

14:03.188 --> 14:05.021
Best player in the world. I like that.

14:05.023 --> 14:06.856
You like that? I'm gonna use that.

14:06.858 --> 14:08.858
Careful. Shit like that
can bite you in the ass.

14:08.860 --> 14:11.528
See, that's the difference
between me and you, Jimmy.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.196
You know, I got faith in people.

14:13.248 --> 14:15.365
Fuck people and fuck their other people.

14:15.367 --> 14:17.200
Don't mind him. He's
been drinking since noon.

14:17.252 --> 14:19.252
Welcome to the big time, shit box.

14:19.288 --> 14:20.754
Ah, thank you, fucko.

14:20.789 --> 14:22.756
That's pronounced fuck-ee.
You taught me that.

14:22.791 --> 14:24.040
Only three easy lessons.

14:24.092 --> 14:25.425
Blow me, cocksucker.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.344
Now you see, that's just redundant.

14:27.379 --> 14:29.129
Reggie's very particular about
language, for fuck's sake.

14:30.549 --> 14:31.848
I've marked you for 100,000 to start off.

14:31.883 --> 14:33.300
Wonderful. Thank you.

14:33.352 --> 14:35.719
All right, gentlemen. Plumb your assholes.

14:35.721 --> 14:38.021
I got an extra stack of
chips up there right now.

14:43.028 --> 14:46.229
All right, Jupiter, you got
nine out of 15 right, Jack.

14:46.281 --> 14:48.231
That is very good.

14:48.233 --> 14:50.400
- Same score as Eli Manning.
- Who's that?

14:50.402 --> 14:52.035
The Jewish Manning brother.

14:52.070 --> 14:54.070
- How did I do?
- You'd be a good football player,

14:54.072 --> 14:55.405
'cause you dumb as hell.

14:55.407 --> 14:57.407
- Julius.
- You got four out of 15 right,

14:57.459 --> 15:01.211
which means you got 11 out of 15 wrong.

15:01.246 --> 15:04.581
Okay. That's why we take practice tests

15:04.633 --> 15:07.050
so we can shake the rust off.

15:07.085 --> 15:09.552
It's been a while since I
felt the pressures of an exam.

15:09.588 --> 15:12.138
Jupiter, it also suggests a profession.

15:12.174 --> 15:15.892
- For you, an attorney.
- Oh, that's what's up. I like that.

15:15.927 --> 15:18.728
- And it suggests for you...
- Oh, uh, I don't need to know.

15:18.764 --> 15:20.730
a janitor or a night watchman.

15:20.766 --> 15:22.148
Thank you.

15:22.184 --> 15:25.268
Night watchman is a... a noble profession.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.653
You keep the block safe.

15:26.688 --> 15:28.321
And janitors deal with toilets.

15:28.357 --> 15:31.408
Everybody needs toilets.
Matter of fact, I need one now.

15:31.443 --> 15:32.609
Did I get that first one wrong?

15:32.661 --> 15:33.827
Oh, yeah.

15:33.862 --> 15:35.578
Aw, man, that one was easy.

15:35.614 --> 15:37.781
See, you just subtract
this shit from that shit.

15:37.833 --> 15:39.616
Then you divide it by the other shit.

15:39.668 --> 15:41.117
You ain't even gotta
finish all the division

15:41.119 --> 15:42.452
once you see the first number is a two.

15:42.454 --> 15:44.704
Yeah, that's true.

15:44.756 --> 15:47.090
Very good, Jupiter. You
got a knack for this.

15:47.125 --> 15:48.375
Plus I... I got a little trick.

15:48.427 --> 15:49.876
See, I just take all the questions

15:49.928 --> 15:51.711
and replace the nouns with pills.

15:51.763 --> 15:53.880
Like this one. This one would be

15:53.932 --> 15:57.217
"Two-Tone got Percocets
at $22 each and Oxys at 19.

15:57.269 --> 16:00.970
If he owe 255 by Friday, how
he gonna prime his stash?"

16:00.972 --> 16:02.188
Show... show me on paper.

16:02.224 --> 16:04.224
I can't. You got a medicine cabinet?

16:04.276 --> 16:06.309
Not filled with Oxys and Percocets.

16:06.361 --> 16:08.812
You know what? Let's try it again.

16:08.814 --> 16:11.448
Yeah, rack up another one
of these gentle bitches.

16:27.716 --> 16:29.499
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:33.255 --> 16:35.588
Dope dress. Dope tie.

16:54.192 --> 16:55.325
I'll take one of those.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.026
Appreciate your time.

16:57.028 --> 16:58.862
Say it.

16:58.864 --> 17:00.697
I don't need to.

17:00.699 --> 17:02.449
Tom, just say it, man.
We know you think it.

17:02.501 --> 17:04.451
Say it.

17:04.502 --> 17:06.419
I'm the best poker player in the world.

17:11.041 --> 17:13.376
Man, I love that Jewish trash talk.

17:13.377 --> 17:15.762
Randy, get Jeffrey Shinestein on line one.

17:18.550 --> 17:23.019
So, Jimmy, nail any Russian
models recently, for fuck's sake?

17:23.054 --> 17:24.387
I can't help it. It's herring in a barrel.

17:24.388 --> 17:25.939
They're incredibly hot,

17:25.973 --> 17:27.523
and they're attracted to private aviation.

17:27.559 --> 17:29.442
Plus American men are very appealing

17:29.478 --> 17:31.194
in comparison to the men of their homeland.

17:31.229 --> 17:32.896
Slavic men have flat skulls in the back.

17:32.898 --> 17:34.531
Less brain, I assume.

17:34.566 --> 17:36.366
Can't be saying shit
like that out loud, man.

17:36.401 --> 17:38.067
Who's listening but us?

17:38.120 --> 17:40.703
Can't be much fun to date
behind the Iron Curtain.

17:40.739 --> 17:42.789
The Iron Curtain is what I call my prenup.

17:42.824 --> 17:45.542
Ugh, I already feel
sorry for your next wife.

17:45.577 --> 17:47.377
Me, too. She'll be an
accidentally beautiful girl

17:47.412 --> 17:49.245
from some inbred village in the Ukraine

17:49.247 --> 17:51.748
who was born the day I was
kicked out of grad school,

17:51.750 --> 17:54.417
she'll marry me for my money,
tolerate my gray, sagging balls

17:54.469 --> 17:57.720
and my unconvincing erections
like some kind of sexual saint,

17:57.756 --> 17:59.672
and then five years
later I'll throw her back

17:59.724 --> 18:02.008
with nothing but a
prenegotiated monthly stipend

18:02.060 --> 18:04.427
and the awful memory of the
noises I make when I cum.

18:04.429 --> 18:06.095
Whoa, man.

18:06.148 --> 18:07.263
Five years is optimistic.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.099
Reg, you married, right?

18:10.152 --> 18:11.518
Yeah, happily. Why you ask?

18:11.570 --> 18:12.936
I'm trying to get Jimmy
to shut the hell up.

18:15.774 --> 18:17.106
I fold.

18:17.159 --> 18:18.658
Jimmy, card.

18:18.693 --> 18:20.109
Yeah, since this pinhead folded,

18:20.162 --> 18:21.611
I gotta play whether
I got something or not.

18:21.613 --> 18:23.446
Which I may or may not. We'll see.

18:23.448 --> 18:25.915
Reggie?

18:25.951 --> 18:29.335
Ah, five-foot nothing,
a hundred and nothing,

18:29.371 --> 18:31.955
which is a shame, because
I think I'm sitting next

18:32.007 --> 18:34.007
to rich bluffer number one
and rich bluffer number two.

18:34.042 --> 18:35.792
- I fold.
- I fold.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.263
Dealer's in. Let's see 'em.

18:40.298 --> 18:42.966
- Oh!
- He got bullets.

18:43.018 --> 18:44.634
Both of y'all match that pot.

18:44.636 --> 18:47.637
Oh, Tom Werner, silent assassin.

18:47.639 --> 18:49.138
I know, you never see it coming.

18:49.140 --> 18:50.773
There goes my underpants.

18:52.644 --> 18:54.477
- Boxers or briefs?
- Oh.

18:54.529 --> 18:55.945
What the fuck did you just ask him?

18:55.981 --> 18:57.730
It's a perfectly legitimate question.

18:57.782 --> 18:59.449
Michael Jordan wears tighty blackies.

18:59.484 --> 19:01.317
What the... Oh, my...

19:02.871 --> 19:04.821
Reg, I told you to bring Cam to Nike.

19:04.873 --> 19:07.323
Oh...

19:18.136 --> 19:19.802
What is it already?

19:21.389 --> 19:24.557
Jupe, you got 10 out of 15 correct.

19:24.593 --> 19:25.725
Yes.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.677
And your comparable is Steve Young.

19:27.729 --> 19:30.063
Consider a career as a chemical engineer.

19:32.851 --> 19:35.518
Missy, you got five out of 15.

19:35.520 --> 19:36.736
Damn it!

19:36.771 --> 19:38.354
You Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s comparable.

19:38.356 --> 19:40.406
- Really?
- Excuse me. I mean Radio.

19:40.442 --> 19:42.492
You kidding me?

19:42.527 --> 19:45.745
You're telling me I'm so dumb,
I'm not even a real person?

19:45.780 --> 19:47.580
I'm a fictional idiot?

19:47.616 --> 19:50.033
Well, "Radio" was based on a true story.

19:54.539 --> 19:56.089
I like this place.

19:56.124 --> 19:57.874
Food's delicious. Company's all right.

19:57.926 --> 19:59.709
I actually can't taste the food.

19:59.711 --> 20:01.878
- Why not?
- I don't taste anything when I'm out with you.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.463
I don't see anything but you,

20:03.515 --> 20:05.214
don't hear anything
except your voice, don't...

20:05.216 --> 20:07.383
Look, you gotta stop
saying stuff like that.

20:07.385 --> 20:09.969
- Why?
- 'Cause at some point I'm gonna start to believe it.

20:10.021 --> 20:11.521
- And that's bad?
- Awful.

20:11.556 --> 20:13.022
The road to ruin.

20:15.277 --> 20:17.610
I've been exposed to HPV.

20:18.863 --> 20:21.147
It's a noncancerous strain.

20:21.199 --> 20:26.152
Um, I don't have symptoms,
but, um, I could still have it.

20:26.204 --> 20:28.154
And I've read everything
that I could about it,

20:28.206 --> 20:31.991
most of which is vague and confusing.

20:32.043 --> 20:33.910
But, you know, the bottom line is,

20:33.962 --> 20:36.579
even if we do use protection,

20:36.581 --> 20:38.965
there's a small chance
I could give it to you.

20:41.169 --> 20:43.002
I don't mean to presume.

20:43.054 --> 20:46.673
I mean, it seems like we're
headed towards being together.

20:46.725 --> 20:50.476
I hope so, anyways, so, you
know, I want you to know.

20:56.101 --> 20:57.767
I'm sorry.

21:00.772 --> 21:03.239
It was a stupid thing to bring up.

21:03.274 --> 21:04.907
Or too soon. Or something.

21:06.945 --> 21:09.746
That's what you call a
bell you can't un-ring.

21:09.781 --> 21:12.031
I'm... should I get the
check? I'm gonna get the check.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.449
I'm sorry that happened to you.

21:13.451 --> 21:15.451
- Yeah, me, too.
- You know what it makes you?

21:15.503 --> 21:18.037
An outcast. A stained person.

21:18.089 --> 21:20.423
Not the HPV.

21:20.458 --> 21:23.126
The HPV I really don't care for.

21:23.178 --> 21:25.962
That I admit.

21:26.014 --> 21:28.965
But the fact that you told me,

21:28.967 --> 21:30.216
you know what that makes you?

21:30.268 --> 21:31.884
A loser?

21:31.936 --> 21:34.437
It makes you a man I could love.

21:42.981 --> 21:44.781
Eat your dinner.

21:44.816 --> 21:47.617
Try to taste it.

21:47.652 --> 21:51.154
Who knows, maybe life is good.

21:59.497 --> 22:01.164
I'm over here thinking,

22:01.216 --> 22:03.166
and I want you guys to
ponder it a little bit.

22:03.218 --> 22:04.884
Has nothing to do with the game,

22:04.919 --> 22:06.502
but, now, y'all know those big trees,

22:06.504 --> 22:10.139
like, those redwood
trees, those giant trees?

22:10.175 --> 22:12.308
How could they not have consciousness?

22:16.014 --> 22:17.346
Thanks a lot, LeBron.

22:17.348 --> 22:19.482
I got, like, 12 fireplaces in this place.

22:19.517 --> 22:20.516
You gotta go green, Jimmy.

22:22.987 --> 22:24.854
Tom?

22:24.906 --> 22:26.773
I got 15 fireplaces.

22:29.744 --> 22:31.527
No, no, actually, uh, it's on you.

22:31.579 --> 22:33.780
Big pot to match if I'm wrong.

22:33.832 --> 22:36.032
- You're never wrong.
- It's true.

22:36.034 --> 22:37.116
Guts.

22:38.336 --> 22:39.502
I knew it.

22:39.537 --> 22:40.870
I knew it.

22:40.872 --> 22:43.172
Chen?

22:43.208 --> 22:44.507
No guts, no glory.

22:44.542 --> 22:46.876
Ah, I got bupkis, for fuck's sake.

22:46.928 --> 22:48.544
- He's overusing that.
- I know.

22:48.546 --> 22:51.180
Best player in the world?

22:51.216 --> 22:53.966
Oh, I got a good hand.

22:54.018 --> 22:57.437
What do you have over there?

22:57.472 --> 23:00.223
This is a big pot right here.

23:00.275 --> 23:02.942
That's why the cards got backs on 'em, huh?

23:07.982 --> 23:10.199
I got guts. I'm gonna call.

23:10.235 --> 23:11.400
Look, I'm gonna stay.

23:11.453 --> 23:13.703
Reminds me of another number 23

23:13.738 --> 23:15.571
who once sat at this table.

23:15.573 --> 23:17.790
I got Hornets floor seats for life.

23:19.744 --> 23:20.710
Jimmy?

23:20.745 --> 23:24.997
Ah, fuck it. I'm folding.

23:25.049 --> 23:27.333
It's on you, big man.

23:35.977 --> 23:40.263
Come on. It's only a
fifth of a million dollars.

23:40.265 --> 23:43.266
- I got a chance.
- I think we all can see that you do.

23:43.318 --> 23:46.185
Maybe, or maybe you see
what I want you to see.

23:46.237 --> 23:47.937
Oh!

23:47.989 --> 23:49.739
He's good, this guy.

23:49.774 --> 23:52.074
I love this game. Can I just
say that I love this game?

23:52.110 --> 23:53.743
I will pay you to stop saying it.

23:53.778 --> 23:55.278
Yeah, the pachinko
machines are down the hall.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.445
Japanese, for fuck's sake.

23:56.447 --> 23:59.198
Reg, destiny's calling.

23:59.250 --> 24:01.450
And common sense is trying
not to answer the phone.

24:03.338 --> 24:04.754
Guts.

24:06.508 --> 24:08.124
Oh, man. Three in.

24:08.176 --> 24:09.926
Tom.

24:11.346 --> 24:12.795
Pair of kings.

24:12.847 --> 24:14.797
Oh, that's a great hand.

24:14.849 --> 24:18.301
But I got you. I got a
queen high to the flush.

24:20.638 --> 24:22.305
Ah, no, no, no.

24:27.645 --> 24:29.061
Ace high to the flush.

24:32.984 --> 24:35.117
Man!

24:35.153 --> 24:37.987
Feels like you just took the greatest
shit of your life. Am I right?

24:37.989 --> 24:39.655
Yeah.

24:39.707 --> 24:42.124
Man, now you got... huh... you
got Werner's underpants now,

24:42.160 --> 24:43.743
and that... that never happens.

24:44.879 --> 24:46.162
Yeah, check the label.

24:46.164 --> 24:47.914
If it says "Flaherty," I want 'em back.

24:47.966 --> 24:49.582
Way to go, Reg. That was a great call.

24:49.634 --> 24:51.167
- Man.
- Way to go.

24:51.169 --> 24:53.169
Thank you. That's me? That's me?

24:53.171 --> 24:54.503
- Get that.
- Okay.

24:54.556 --> 24:56.088
Congrats.

24:56.140 --> 24:58.341
- Thank you.
- Not bad, my man.

24:58.393 --> 25:00.927
- Not bad.
- Thank you.

25:00.979 --> 25:02.812
- Yeah.
- Good night, rich bluffers.

25:02.847 --> 25:04.313
Hey, fuck you, Jimmy.

25:04.349 --> 25:07.016
Next time. Next time.

25:24.586 --> 25:25.868
Don't worry, sir.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.753
Oh...

25:27.789 --> 25:29.455
I'll hit it again.

25:30.959 --> 25:32.375
Thank you.

25:32.427 --> 25:34.877
And can we keep this between us?

25:34.879 --> 25:37.263
You have any idea how many people
have thrown up in this driveway?

25:55.733 --> 25:57.733
Shit.

26:00.705 --> 26:03.239
I'm not having a baby.

26:03.241 --> 26:06.242
I don't want to bring a
moron child into this world.

26:06.294 --> 26:07.910
I won't know what to do, Reggie.

26:07.912 --> 26:10.212
I'll try to breast-feed him with my ass.

26:10.248 --> 26:12.381
I think the baby would know
the difference in smell.

26:12.417 --> 26:14.250
Mine won't.

26:14.252 --> 26:16.085
Baby, you're the smartest person I know.

26:16.137 --> 26:18.254
You need to meet more people.

26:18.306 --> 26:20.473
You know the difference
between your life and Jupiter's?

26:20.508 --> 26:23.592
You got time to think. You
don't need no Wonderlic.

26:23.594 --> 26:25.761
Oh, fuck me, Reggie.

26:25.763 --> 26:28.764
Ah! Fuck me like a janitor!

26:30.151 --> 26:32.101
Make me clean the floor!

26:32.153 --> 26:35.905
Ah! Fuck my retarded brains out!

26:38.776 --> 26:39.981
Babe, you can't say "retarded."
That's like, it's not cool.

26:40.778 --> 26:43.446
- It's not cool.
- You really mad right now?

26:43.448 --> 26:45.247
No, I'm just saying, I'm now
thinking about this kid...

26:45.283 --> 26:46.749
Reggie, fuck me! Shut up.

26:46.784 --> 26:48.951
Give me a minute. I'm gonna get it back.

26:48.953 --> 26:50.536
Now I'm thinking about this fucking
kid I went to school with, named Joseph

26:50.588 --> 26:52.538
- Jesus. Give me a second.
- Oh, God.

26:52.590 --> 26:56.208
Why would you say "retarded"? God damn it.

26:56.260 --> 26:58.094
Okay, all right. Here we go. I'm back.

26:58.129 --> 27:00.046
Oh, fuck my brains out!

27:00.098 --> 27:01.530
That shouldn't take long.
