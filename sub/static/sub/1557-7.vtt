    get the credit he deserves.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.621
Today, I went down and I watched
him in the courtroom.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.356
    I knew that was you.
I recognized your ringtone.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.324

       forced to get jobs.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.007
No, that's not it. That's not
   it, but it was so close.

  The receptionist was <i> so mean,</i>

20:00.200 --> 20:02.033
            And I went
      and I cried in my car.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.234
    And I was about to leave,

20:03.236 --> 20:05.703

   you were talking to my dad,

20:05.705 --> 20:07.338
     So I got back in there!

20:07.340 --> 20:09.540
