00:03.500 --> 00:07.300
I sense something in you,
as you sense it in me.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.240
You can't deny it.

00:15.900 --> 00:18.730
Why am I not dead already?
I was due to be hanged.

00:18.780 --> 00:20.330
Stop worrying about such things.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.380
What have you done?

00:22.940 --> 00:26.380
I have kept my side of the bargain.
Now you must keep yours.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.690
I'd started to think
you weren't coming.

01:01.740 --> 01:03.740
I said I'd be here.

01:04.220 --> 01:05.890
There's something wrong.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.980
What is it?

01:19.620 --> 01:21.020
Come on.

01:28.980 --> 01:30.250
Halt!

01:35.740 --> 01:37.420
Over there!

01:38.620 --> 01:40.360
We're trapped.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.720
We must wait here until it's safe.

02:05.260 --> 02:09.449
Pythagoras should have returned
by now. This is a fool's errand.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.370
I won't leave Diocles
rotting in a cell.

02:11.420 --> 02:15.850
Why don't we lock ourselves in with
him? Save Pasiphae the trouble.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.570
I have a debt to pay.

02:17.620 --> 02:19.690
I mean to honour it.

02:23.140 --> 02:27.380
How is your father?
You said he was sick.

02:28.380 --> 02:31.100
He was. He's much better now.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.100
It's a clear night.

02:37.740 --> 02:42.130
I sometimes wonder how the
sky can be so full of stars.

02:42.180 --> 02:46.460
I once spent several long
nights trying to count them.

02:47.820 --> 02:49.570
- How many are there?
- I don't know.

02:49.620 --> 02:52.330
One star looks much
the same as another.

02:52.380 --> 02:56.090
Perhaps if I were to divide the
sky into quadrants, then...

02:56.140 --> 02:59.340
Only you would think
of doing such a thing.

03:00.540 --> 03:02.080
I'm sorry.

03:02.740 --> 03:04.530
I'm boring you.

03:04.580 --> 03:07.250
I'm never bored in your company.

03:11.620 --> 03:15.320
It's been a long while
since a patrol has passed.

03:23.140 --> 03:26.050
- Are you certain you weren't followed?
- I made sure of it.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.650
Icarus has found a way for us to
get into the arena. From there,

03:28.700 --> 03:30.410
we should be able to
break into the cells.

03:30.460 --> 03:34.130
Icarus, tell Jason he's insane and we're
all going to be caught and executed.

03:34.180 --> 03:38.050
Look, you can see it in his face. He
thinks it's madness, utter madness.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.770
We should go.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.570
Oh, great(!) The sewers.

03:54.220 --> 03:57.020
I can already taste the stench. Oh!

03:57.540 --> 04:00.690
Head north. After about 500 paces,
you'll come to another grate.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.020
It will bring you out in the
arena, underneath the stands.

04:10.220 --> 04:12.290
Meet me at the hunting
lodge in three days' time.

04:12.340 --> 04:15.090
Bring whatever supplies you can.

04:15.140 --> 04:17.209
Pythagoras?

04:17.260 --> 04:19.170
May the gods be with you.

04:19.220 --> 04:21.300
And you too.

04:35.660 --> 04:38.890
Nicomedas wishes for his son
to be trained as a priest.

04:38.940 --> 04:40.770
I don't see how that's
any concern of mine.

04:40.820 --> 04:45.130
Nicomedas is a powerful man. You may need
his support in these uncertain times.

04:45.180 --> 04:47.980
Very well. I will speak with Melas.

04:50.580 --> 04:52.730
- What is it?
- My informant was right.

04:52.780 --> 04:56.690
Jason plans to break a prisoner out
of the cells beneath the amphitheatre.

04:56.740 --> 04:59.650
He is making his way
there as we speak.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.730
You cannot afford to hesitate.

05:01.780 --> 05:04.980
Jason must be caught
and he must be killed.

05:14.980 --> 05:16.450
Leave us.

05:21.380 --> 05:23.490
You would really see him die?

05:23.540 --> 05:25.580
I have no choice.

05:30.220 --> 05:31.890
This night...

05:32.540 --> 05:34.140
... it ends.

06:00.020 --> 06:02.340
This must be it.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.040
Jason!

07:26.260 --> 07:28.490
Jason? I thought you were dead.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.210
- How is this possible?
- Are you coming?

07:30.260 --> 07:33.050
What about the others?
I cannot leave them.

07:33.100 --> 07:36.730
This is suicide. It's worse than
suicide, whatever that is.

07:36.780 --> 07:39.880
If you want your freedom,
come with us.

07:57.940 --> 08:00.050
I'd come to believe I
would die in this place.

08:00.100 --> 08:03.420
You saved my life. I wasn't
going to forget that.

08:21.340 --> 08:22.540
Run!

08:25.940 --> 08:27.540
Run!

08:48.260 --> 08:50.530
They were waiting for us.

08:54.420 --> 08:56.220
Icarus...

09:00.700 --> 09:02.900
Go! Make for the alley!

09:05.420 --> 09:07.300
Pythagoras, go!

09:28.380 --> 09:30.170
Now, wait here.

09:30.220 --> 09:32.210
I'll scout ahead.

10:04.140 --> 10:05.480
Jason!

10:27.060 --> 10:29.330
Jason was injured and unarmed.

10:29.380 --> 10:32.170
My men had him at their mercy.

10:32.220 --> 10:35.890
The only reason he is still alive
is because of your niece.

10:35.940 --> 10:37.970
No, she would never
betray me like that.

10:38.020 --> 10:40.360
I saw it with my own eyes.

10:43.900 --> 10:46.500
She is no longer to be trusted.

11:26.860 --> 11:29.850
Leon? I thought you were dead.

11:29.900 --> 11:31.810
A few of us managed to escape.

11:31.860 --> 11:33.890
Is this all of you?

11:33.940 --> 11:37.140
The others were cut down.
None were spared.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.010
I'm truly sorry.

11:39.060 --> 11:40.610
You're not to blame.

11:40.660 --> 11:43.450
You gave them a better chance than
they would have had otherwise.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.970
We should make for our camp.

11:54.340 --> 11:57.080
Thinking about Icarus, aren't you?

11:59.620 --> 12:02.490
You'll see him soon enough. Come on.

12:14.620 --> 12:15.970
Father?

12:16.020 --> 12:17.220
Hey.

12:18.180 --> 12:20.060
My son.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.610
Drink this.

12:23.660 --> 12:24.800
Mm.

12:26.860 --> 12:29.930
If they're going to kill me, why are
they allowing you to give me medicine?

12:29.980 --> 12:32.380
Don't think about that now.

12:33.580 --> 12:39.620
Every day I think I am to be executed,
and yet every day you come in their place?

12:40.620 --> 12:43.810
- Drink some water.
- Why? Why am I still alive?

12:43.860 --> 12:46.400
Just be thankful that you are.

12:49.860 --> 12:52.980
I can always tell when you're
keeping something from me.

12:55.860 --> 12:58.860
- I had no choice.
- What did you do?

12:59.700 --> 13:02.490
- It's better that you do not know.
- Tell me.

13:02.540 --> 13:04.540
I'm your father.

13:06.140 --> 13:07.330
They wanted information.

13:07.380 --> 13:09.540
About what?

13:11.580 --> 13:13.170
- Jason and Pythagoras.
- No, no.

13:13.220 --> 13:14.730
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I had to.

13:14.780 --> 13:16.450
It was the only way to stop
them from executing you.

13:16.500 --> 13:17.890
You stupid boy.

13:17.940 --> 13:20.810
But Jason and Pythagoras
are unharmed. They escaped.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.930
That changes nothing.

13:23.700 --> 13:24.810
What are you going to do?

13:24.860 --> 13:26.890
Keep on betraying them until
they're both caught and killed?

13:26.940 --> 13:28.250
I couldn't see you die.

13:28.300 --> 13:32.930
I would rather die than
have a traitor for a son.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.610
Get out. Get out!

13:35.660 --> 13:38.500
Please... Father...

13:39.540 --> 13:42.080
I have never been so ashamed.

13:59.300 --> 14:02.820
- How long have you been there?
- A while.

14:05.300 --> 14:08.210
When you were younger, I would often
sit with you while you slept.

14:08.260 --> 14:12.780
You had such terrible nightmares.
You... you would call out for me.

14:14.780 --> 14:17.730
I would hold you till
you fell back to sleep.

14:17.780 --> 14:19.920
Such a troubled child.

14:22.700 --> 14:25.100
Were you dreaming of Jason?

14:25.700 --> 14:28.690
- I do not remember.
- You said his name.

14:28.740 --> 14:32.440
It is only natural that
you would be drawn to him.

14:33.340 --> 14:36.530
It is almost like I
feel what he feels.

14:36.580 --> 14:39.890
He's a part of me, and
I am a part of him.

14:39.940 --> 14:42.980
Is that why you saved his life?

14:45.300 --> 14:48.800
- You would deny it?
- I could not see him die.

14:51.100 --> 14:54.800
The bond between you is
stronger than I realised.

14:55.460 --> 14:58.970
I should have done more to protect
you from your feelings.

14:59.020 --> 15:02.540
I do not want protecting from them. I
have never felt like this about anyone.

15:04.140 --> 15:05.810
You love him?

15:07.420 --> 15:09.360
Oh, my poor child.

15:09.780 --> 15:13.500
Whatever feelings you have for him,
you must banish them from your mind.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.200
I don't know if I can. He's
always in my thoughts.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.770
You thought you could turn him.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.560
But it is he who has turned you...

15:23.820 --> 15:26.920
.. and I will not allow
that to happen.

15:27.620 --> 15:31.500
If you try and see Jason again,
you will leave me no choice.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.610
I will slit your throat and
watch you bleed at my feet.

15:38.660 --> 15:42.250
I nurtured you when others
shunned you. All that you are,

15:42.300 --> 15:44.170
all that you have,

15:44.220 --> 15:46.180
is because of me.

16:00.700 --> 16:03.930
More than anyone, I understand
what you're feeling.

16:03.980 --> 16:07.860
But you will soon come to realise just
how misguided those feelings are.

16:47.780 --> 16:50.060
(Jason.)

16:57.020 --> 16:58.690
Your Majesty.

16:59.660 --> 17:02.460
It's not I you should kneel before.

17:02.780 --> 17:05.720
Jason is the true heir to the throne.

17:06.579 --> 17:07.890
How can that be?

17:07.940 --> 17:09.730
He is the son of King Aeson.

17:09.780 --> 17:12.329
For too long, Atlantis has been ruled

17:12.380 --> 17:14.450
by those who have no rightful
claim to the throne.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.660
They've ruled through
tyranny and fear.

17:19.410 --> 17:20.410
That must change.

17:20.460 --> 17:23.940
All this time... We fought
together, shared a cell.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.770
You said nothing.

17:26.819 --> 17:29.410
A king must earn loyalty,
not demand it.

17:29.460 --> 17:31.970
Then you have more than earned mine.

17:32.020 --> 17:34.740
He speaks for all of us.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.540
So...

17:55.540 --> 18:00.060
... we're sharing our camp with a
bunch of cut-throats and thieves.

18:01.020 --> 18:03.760
They can hunt. I'll give 'em that.

18:05.420 --> 18:08.020
I should take my turn on watch.

18:19.740 --> 18:22.280
It seems you have a new army.

18:22.820 --> 18:24.570
It's hardly an army.

18:24.620 --> 18:26.530
More will join.

18:26.580 --> 18:28.650
You inspire loyalty.

18:32.180 --> 18:36.370
There was a time when I asked
for your hand in marriage...

18:36.420 --> 18:38.220
And I said yes.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.640
I would say yes again.

18:46.740 --> 18:49.820
I've come to realise that
the future's so uncertain.

18:51.220 --> 18:53.360
Every day is precious.

18:54.060 --> 18:56.330
I cannot wait any longer.

18:57.860 --> 18:59.580
Marry me...

19:00.580 --> 19:04.780
... here in the forest, and
let us never be apart again.

19:28.900 --> 19:34.980
Estin eros hagnos, tis
gar prodidosin erastes.

20:08.460 --> 20:15.340
Estin eros hagnos, tis
gar prodidosin erastes.

21:33.900 --> 21:37.370
Nuun zetema kratos psuukhes
en benthesin autes.

21:42.020 --> 21:46.020
Uden gar bios est'ei
me nekuuessin oneiros.

22:32.860 --> 22:35.210
The man who was watching
Medea was found dead.

22:35.260 --> 22:37.290
We must assume she has fled the city.

22:37.340 --> 22:40.250
- And no-one saw her?
- It is the eve of the solstice.

22:40.300 --> 22:43.300
The streets are filled
with worshippers.

22:44.900 --> 22:46.410
Foolish girl.

22:46.460 --> 22:48.530
What are your orders?

22:48.940 --> 22:51.860
It seems Medea has made her choice.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.940
Hunt her down and kill her.

23:06.140 --> 23:10.490
First her son, now her niece. It seems
the Queen is running out of allies.

23:10.540 --> 23:13.250
There are still those
of us who remain loyal.

23:13.300 --> 23:15.970
I count myself chief among them.

23:16.740 --> 23:20.860
But these are troubling times. Who
knows what the future may hold?

23:22.740 --> 23:26.450
What is certain is that
men like us will shape it.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.890
I do not have time for
your idle speculation.

23:29.940 --> 23:32.940
Of course. You must
do as you are bid.

24:17.460 --> 24:18.690
What are you doing here?

24:18.740 --> 24:21.740
I wanted to see you
again before I left.

24:22.300 --> 24:25.210
- I'm returning home to Colchis.
- Why? What's happened?

24:25.260 --> 24:27.770
Pasiphae's protected
me since I was a child.

24:27.820 --> 24:31.810
I realise now that she nurtured
me so I would become like her.

24:31.860 --> 24:34.980
But I cannot. I won't.

24:36.020 --> 24:41.300
None of us will know peace
until Pasiphae is defeated.

24:44.540 --> 24:45.970
I can help you.

24:46.020 --> 24:47.290
How?

24:47.340 --> 24:49.890
It is the winter solstice.

24:49.940 --> 24:53.010
Pasiphae must travel tonight to
the temple of Chthonia at Nemi.

24:53.060 --> 24:55.370
She's sure to be well protected.

24:55.420 --> 24:57.810
On the journey, yes.

24:57.860 --> 25:02.450
But the temple is the seat of Hecate's
power. The goddess guards it jealously.

25:02.500 --> 25:06.780
No mortal man may enter, only
those touched by the gods.

25:09.260 --> 25:11.300
She will be alone.

25:12.260 --> 25:13.770
This will help you.

25:13.820 --> 25:15.850
- What is it?
- The nectar of the passionflower.

25:15.900 --> 25:18.900
If it is imbibed, it will
lessen Pasiphae's power.

25:20.020 --> 25:22.760
You will not defeat her otherwise.

25:23.180 --> 25:24.720
Thank you.

25:26.140 --> 25:28.490
It seems you're always
coming to my aid.

25:28.540 --> 25:30.410
I should go.

25:30.460 --> 25:33.200
I have a long journey ahead of me.

25:35.220 --> 25:37.650
What is it?

25:37.700 --> 25:41.400
There's a part of me that
doesn't want you to go.

25:44.860 --> 25:47.570
No, I can't.

25:47.620 --> 25:49.490
I know you have affection
for me. I feel it.

25:49.540 --> 25:51.100
Shh, shh.

25:53.860 --> 25:56.060
I'm married to Ariadne.

26:00.140 --> 26:01.940
I'm sorry.

26:04.820 --> 26:06.890
Then this is goodbye.

26:24.780 --> 26:27.520
Is there something troubling you?

26:31.740 --> 26:35.240
When I woke up this morning,
you weren't there.

26:36.540 --> 26:38.410
I was with Medea.

26:40.250 --> 26:41.250
She was here?

26:41.300 --> 26:43.890
We have to leave now.
If that witch was here,

26:43.940 --> 26:45.730
Pasiphae and her soldiers
won't be far behind.

26:45.780 --> 26:47.730
No, Medea hasn't betrayed us.

26:47.780 --> 26:49.410
Oh, really? The last
time you trusted her,

26:49.460 --> 26:50.850
the Queen ended up with

26:50.900 --> 26:53.490
- a knife in her side.
- Look, she's not who you think she is.

26:53.540 --> 26:54.570
How can you say that,

26:54.620 --> 26:56.650
- after all she's done?
- Because Medea has seen Pasiphae

26:56.700 --> 26:59.970
for who she really is, and she
wants nothing more to do with her.

27:00.020 --> 27:01.650
Everything that comes out
of her mouth is a lie!

27:01.700 --> 27:05.370
- Why you can't see that is beyond me.
- Today is the solstice.

27:05.420 --> 27:07.570
Pasiphae will travel
to the temple at Nemi.

27:07.620 --> 27:09.850
And when she does,
she will enter alone.

27:09.900 --> 27:12.450
It may be our last chance to strike.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.450
I'm assuming Medea told you this?

27:14.500 --> 27:16.290
Yes.

27:16.340 --> 27:19.730
Even the blindest and most
stupid of stupid blind men

27:19.780 --> 27:21.770
could tell this is a trap!

27:21.820 --> 27:22.970
Well, I trust her.

27:23.020 --> 27:26.210
Why would you trust someone
who nearly took my life?

27:26.260 --> 27:28.800
You don't know her like I do.

27:29.460 --> 27:31.370
The temple is a sacred place.

27:31.420 --> 27:33.970
Only those touched
by the gods may enter.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.770
We cannot accompany you inside.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.570
Well, this may be our only chance.

27:38.620 --> 27:42.380
I have to face her,
even if it is alone.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.240
The men are ready.

27:56.860 --> 27:58.460
What is it?

28:00.340 --> 28:03.210
It would be safer for you
to remain in Atlantis.

28:03.260 --> 28:05.210
I'm required to pay homage.

28:05.260 --> 28:07.450
- You would have me offend the gods?
- That was not my intention.

28:07.500 --> 28:12.660
If my general feels unable to protect me,
perhaps it is time I found a new general.

28:24.580 --> 28:27.130
So, are you going to
tell me what's wrong,

28:27.180 --> 28:30.370
or are we going to spend the
entire journey in silence?

28:30.420 --> 28:31.810
There's nothing wrong.

28:31.860 --> 28:35.900
Really? You've barely said two words
since we returned from Atlantis.

28:48.300 --> 28:50.440
It's Icarus, isn't it?

28:53.220 --> 28:55.500
I remember it well...

28:56.740 --> 29:00.330
... the first time you feel
that way about someone.

29:00.380 --> 29:03.050
You know nothing of my feelings.

29:11.140 --> 29:13.540
She's brought a small army.

29:33.020 --> 29:36.380
This is as far as we go.
You have the passionflower?

29:37.380 --> 29:40.680
I wish you didn't have
to go in there alone.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.850
Just be ready for when I return.

30:25.380 --> 30:27.540
I must continue alone.

30:33.780 --> 30:36.010
Form a perimeter around the temple.

30:36.060 --> 30:38.730
No-one is to enter.

30:38.780 --> 30:40.120
No-one.

30:45.260 --> 30:49.930
Aien eme dunamis kai emon kratos

30:49.980 --> 30:52.460
aiei d'hagnon huudor...

30:55.900 --> 30:59.540
... hoti pantos panta kathairei.

31:30.140 --> 31:31.740
I pity you.

31:32.660 --> 31:35.780
Everyone you have ever
loved has deserted you.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.690
Your husband.

31:39.220 --> 31:40.690
Your son.

31:41.420 --> 31:43.020
Your niece.

31:43.580 --> 31:45.850
You've spoken with Medea?

31:46.980 --> 31:49.050
She has come to see the
darkness in your heart.

31:49.100 --> 31:52.570
She's confused. The child
doesn't know her own mind.

31:52.620 --> 31:53.760
No.

31:54.820 --> 31:57.770
You don't know Medea
as well as you think.

31:57.820 --> 32:02.540
Medea told me that I would
find you here... alone.

32:03.900 --> 32:06.240
You are your father's son.

32:06.820 --> 32:08.560
That I accept.

32:09.700 --> 32:13.200
That is why this will be
so much easier for me.

32:13.980 --> 32:16.120
Er' uun eis korakas...

32:18.140 --> 32:21.770
... kai de kakon oiton oloio.

32:26.420 --> 32:29.360
It seems your powers are failing you.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.490
(You cannot kill me.)

32:36.540 --> 32:38.210
You're right.

32:39.420 --> 32:40.820
I can't.

32:41.820 --> 32:44.220
But there are many who can.

32:56.060 --> 32:58.450
- Alive or dead?
- Alive.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.240
Just checking.

33:13.420 --> 33:15.500
Find them!

33:33.260 --> 33:36.340
I never believed I'd see the
day she'd be at our mercy.

33:37.540 --> 33:39.450
Hundreds of men are
searching the forest.

33:39.500 --> 33:42.210
They have found no trace of Pasiphae.

33:42.260 --> 33:46.170
We must consider the possibility
that she's already dead.

33:46.220 --> 33:47.890
You would have me
call off the search?

33:47.940 --> 33:52.740
If I were you, I would not be so
eager to find the Queen alive.

33:57.900 --> 33:59.930
I should have you executed
as a traitor.

33:59.980 --> 34:02.490
Really?

34:02.540 --> 34:04.850
If Pasiphae is returned
to the throne,

34:04.900 --> 34:07.210
who do you think she'll
blame for her abduction?

34:07.260 --> 34:10.449
You were responsible
for her protection.

34:10.500 --> 34:13.239
She'll mount your head on a stick.

34:16.620 --> 34:20.370
Perhaps we should look to the future.

34:20.420 --> 34:22.889
I am a soldier.

34:22.940 --> 34:25.679
I will leave such matters to you.

34:36.580 --> 34:40.280
- I suppose you've come to gloat?
- Not entirely.

34:40.620 --> 34:43.090
Drink it.

34:45.179 --> 34:46.770
Drink!

34:46.820 --> 34:49.130
Swallow. Swallow it!

34:54.380 --> 34:57.210
Ariadne? Do you love him?

34:57.260 --> 34:59.530
Jason ... do you love him?

35:00.380 --> 35:02.970
More than you could
possibly understand.

35:03.020 --> 35:06.120
Such a shame he's been
unfaithful to you.

35:09.940 --> 35:11.010
What do you mean?

35:11.060 --> 35:14.690
He hasn't spoken to you about his
feelings for Medea, my niece?

35:14.740 --> 35:15.890
He has no feelings for her.

35:15.940 --> 35:19.940
Oh, I think you know that isn't
true. They've become close.

35:22.020 --> 35:23.980
Intimate.

35:27.100 --> 35:29.170
I don't believe you.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.130
Jason wouldn't do that.

35:31.180 --> 35:34.280
Why else would Medea
betray me for him...

35:35.380 --> 35:37.450
... if not for love?

35:37.700 --> 35:40.980
You couldn't possibly understand
the bond between them.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.610
I pity you, Ariadne.

35:46.940 --> 35:49.410
Save your pity for yourself.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.770
I must ask something of you.

36:06.820 --> 36:08.960
You don't have to ask.

36:09.740 --> 36:12.770
Just know that you are
doing the right thing.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.370
Give me a moment.

36:55.740 --> 36:57.370
It's over.

36:57.420 --> 36:59.220
You stupid boy.

37:00.260 --> 37:02.210
It'll never be over.

37:02.260 --> 37:06.580
I know. You will never relinquish
your claim to the throne.

37:11.380 --> 37:14.320
You've finally come to understand me.

37:14.940 --> 37:17.810
That's why I've come to say goodbye.

37:19.660 --> 37:23.610
No. No, Jason, I'm your mother.

37:23.660 --> 37:25.930
There's nothing that shames
me more than that.

37:25.980 --> 37:28.770
No, you are my kin. My blood
runs through your veins.

37:28.820 --> 37:31.210
That's all we have in common.

37:31.260 --> 37:33.250
No, there's no place
for you in this world.

37:33.300 --> 37:35.690
No. The gods will never
allow it. It is forbidden.

37:35.740 --> 37:38.010
You don't serve the gods.

37:38.980 --> 37:41.330
- You only serve yourself.
- Jason...

37:41.380 --> 37:43.610
Please... please...

37:43.660 --> 37:45.400
don't do this.

37:48.700 --> 37:51.490
There is a part of me that
will always love you.

37:51.540 --> 37:54.060
I don't deny that.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.370
But all you know is hate.

37:57.740 --> 37:59.290
Maybe in death, you'll find peace.

37:59.340 --> 38:02.890
Jason, if you do this, you
will never forgive yourself.

38:02.940 --> 38:06.020
You will regret it for
the rest of your life.

38:07.420 --> 38:08.760
I know.

38:13.540 --> 38:16.540
I hope you find peace
with your goddess.

38:22.180 --> 38:23.570
Jason! No! Please...

38:23.620 --> 38:25.410
Jason! Jason!

38:25.460 --> 38:28.210
Don't do this! Please!

38:28.260 --> 38:30.260
I am your mother!

39:16.260 --> 39:18.000
On your knees.

39:24.940 --> 39:26.290
Jason will never forgive you.

39:26.340 --> 39:28.970
That's a chance I'll have to take.

39:29.020 --> 39:32.090
I'll make it swift, which
is more than you deserve.

39:32.140 --> 39:34.730
Please. Let me make peace
with my goddess. Please.

39:34.780 --> 39:39.450
Nuun de se proskaleo, dnopheron
genos ennuukhiaon...

39:39.500 --> 39:41.410
Kill her while she prays, and
we risk angering Poseidon.

39:41.460 --> 39:43.370
We must let her finish.

39:43.420 --> 39:46.330
... genos ennuukhiaon.

39:46.380 --> 39:48.290
She is asking her goddess
for resurrection.

39:48.340 --> 39:49.330
Kai gar ego...

39:49.380 --> 39:52.250
She will rot in Tartarus
with the rest of her kind.

39:52.300 --> 39:55.530
... malake kaleus...

39:55.580 --> 39:58.460
tende thean...

39:59.460 --> 40:02.100
... empsuukhon hapanton...

40:03.180 --> 40:05.940
... s'epikuron...

40:12.700 --> 40:14.300
... pelason.

41:17.420 --> 41:19.060
It's done.

41:26.300 --> 41:30.290
Once it is known, I believe that the people
will see me as their rightful heir.

41:30.340 --> 41:33.330
You do not have the support
of the army or the council.

41:33.380 --> 41:36.010
- Without them, you won't take the throne.
- He's right.

41:36.060 --> 41:38.930
Cilix and his allies will oppose us.

41:40.140 --> 41:42.490
No doubt Cilix will try and
take the throne for himself.

41:42.540 --> 41:44.730
Then we must kill him.

41:44.780 --> 41:47.570
How? He has an army protecting
him in Atlantis.

41:47.620 --> 41:49.610
We have 20 men.

41:49.660 --> 41:51.010
We need to lure him from the city.

41:51.060 --> 41:54.570
We send a message. We tell
him we wish to sue for peace.

41:54.620 --> 41:58.690
Cilix will never fall for
it. He'll know it's a trap.

41:58.740 --> 42:01.380
No doubt Cilix will suspect it.

42:02.380 --> 42:03.450
We must mislead him.

42:03.500 --> 42:05.130
How do you propose we do that?

42:05.180 --> 42:08.180
Cilix will seek to find out
if the offer is genuine.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.250
The only way he can do this

42:11.300 --> 42:14.930
is through the person who has been
betraying us these past weeks.

42:14.980 --> 42:17.380
What are you talking about?

42:20.100 --> 42:21.440
Icarus.

42:24.180 --> 42:25.450
He is a traitor.

42:25.500 --> 42:28.090
No, he wouldn't do that.

42:28.140 --> 42:31.010
As much as it saddens me, it's true.

42:32.460 --> 42:35.500
Perhaps now we can use his
betrayal to our advantage.

43:25.900 --> 43:28.180
Oh, you scared me.

43:29.740 --> 43:31.340
What is it?

43:32.100 --> 43:34.180
It's good to see you.

43:40.020 --> 43:41.370
How are Jason and the Queen?

43:41.420 --> 43:45.740
They are well, considering they are
living as fugitives in the forest.

43:47.780 --> 43:51.450
I sometimes think Ariadne
likes the simplicity of it.

43:51.500 --> 43:54.250
I cannot say the same
for myself or Hercules.

43:54.300 --> 43:56.300
We miss our beds...

43:57.060 --> 43:59.060
.. and our friends.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.880
The city is rife with rumours.

44:05.060 --> 44:07.610
It's difficult to know
what to believe.

44:07.660 --> 44:09.860
What are these rumours?

44:10.220 --> 44:12.820
Some say that Pasiphae is dead.

44:15.820 --> 44:18.010
Then it's true?

44:18.060 --> 44:19.450
Yes.

44:19.500 --> 44:21.650
I did not think I would
ever see the day.

44:21.700 --> 44:23.610
What will happen now?

44:23.660 --> 44:25.450
That is to be seen.

44:25.500 --> 44:28.860
I heard talk that Jason and the
Queen wish to negotiate peace?

44:31.140 --> 44:35.690
It seems we may be returning to the city
much sooner than any of us dared hope.

44:35.740 --> 44:38.290
They would really make peace
with Cilix and the council,

44:38.340 --> 44:41.290
- after all that has happened?
- There's been enough bloodshed.

44:41.340 --> 44:44.440
Jason will do whatever
it takes to end it.

44:46.060 --> 44:48.130
The offer is genuine.

44:50.660 --> 44:52.570
That is welcome news.

44:52.620 --> 44:55.460
Perhaps the end is in sight.

44:57.780 --> 45:00.380
I actually believe it might be.

45:01.660 --> 45:05.100
I must leave soon, if I'm to return
to the city before the curfew.

45:06.940 --> 45:09.880
I will walk some of the way with you.

45:18.740 --> 45:22.050
Let us hope that soon you will
be able to return with me.

45:22.100 --> 45:23.970
The gods willing.

45:31.980 --> 45:34.780
- Take care, my friend.
- And you.

45:58.180 --> 46:00.260
The bait is laid.

46:01.900 --> 46:04.170
Let us hope they take it.

46:06.620 --> 46:09.060
So, it is true?

46:10.100 --> 46:11.530
Pasiphae is dead?

46:11.580 --> 46:14.580
- That's what he said.
- You're certain?

46:16.260 --> 46:18.450
And what of Jason's desire for peace?

46:18.500 --> 46:21.650
If we meet him, might we not be
walking ourselves into an ambush?

46:21.700 --> 46:24.410
No, the offer is genuine.

46:24.460 --> 46:26.290
He is ready to negotiate.

46:26.340 --> 46:28.880
He wants the bloodshed to end.

46:31.180 --> 46:32.930
Please.

46:32.980 --> 46:35.290
I have done all that you have asked.

46:35.340 --> 46:37.280
I'm begging you...

46:38.300 --> 46:40.580
.. release my father.

46:41.940 --> 46:43.890
It will be done.

46:43.940 --> 46:45.610
Wait outside.

46:48.300 --> 46:52.090
Is that wise? He may
be of further use to us.

46:52.140 --> 46:54.500
I gave him my word.

46:55.940 --> 46:58.330
What do you intend to do?

46:58.380 --> 47:01.410
Men like us spend our lives
serving kings and queens.

47:01.460 --> 47:05.130
Perhaps it is time we served
our own interests.

47:05.180 --> 47:07.530
You mean to take the throne?

47:07.580 --> 47:09.290
You have no claim to it.

47:09.340 --> 47:13.290
Whoever has the support of the
army may claim what they like.

47:13.340 --> 47:16.650
You think Jason and Ariadne
will just stand aside?

47:16.700 --> 47:19.690
Of course not. That's
why we must kill them.

47:19.740 --> 47:23.380
What better opportunity than
when we meet to negotiate peace?

47:28.900 --> 47:31.210
You're being released.

47:31.260 --> 47:33.330
I'm taking you home.

47:33.780 --> 47:35.530
At what cost?

47:35.580 --> 47:38.180
All that I did, it was for you.

47:41.860 --> 47:44.050
No. I didn't ask you to do it.

47:44.100 --> 47:47.130
Do not seek my forgiveness.
I cannot give it.

47:47.180 --> 47:50.050
- Please, Father.
- I have nothing more to say to you.

47:50.100 --> 47:52.530
Hate me if you will.

47:52.580 --> 47:55.250
I'm taking you home nonetheless.

48:02.100 --> 48:04.930
Your men found nothing suspicious?

48:04.980 --> 48:06.970
All is as it seems.

48:07.020 --> 48:10.120
Then it appears your
informant was right.

48:10.700 --> 48:13.370
It will all be over soon enough.

48:50.260 --> 48:52.530
I received your message.

48:52.980 --> 48:55.450
I understand you wish
negotiate peace?

48:55.500 --> 48:57.290
I'm sure that is what we all desire.

48:57.340 --> 48:59.540
Ultimately, yes.

49:00.780 --> 49:03.780
But I'm afraid you
won't live to see it.

49:10.460 --> 49:12.020
Now!

49:17.060 --> 49:18.850
Now!

49:18.900 --> 49:20.210
Now!

49:20.260 --> 49:23.660
The men who were sent
to kill us are all dead.

49:27.500 --> 49:30.170
Kill them!

49:30.220 --> 49:32.160
Lower your swords!

49:33.620 --> 49:35.420
Stand down!

49:40.140 --> 49:42.730
It seems your power is
slipping away, Cilix.

49:42.780 --> 49:45.300
Oh, Your Majesty...

49:47.620 --> 49:53.370
You must see that all I did was in the
interests of the city and its people.

49:53.420 --> 49:55.730
The only person you
care for is yourself.

49:55.780 --> 49:58.650
You will need me in the times ahead.

50:01.620 --> 50:05.210
I... I can be useful to you.

50:05.260 --> 50:06.620
Please.

50:08.980 --> 50:11.130
I'm begging you.

50:11.180 --> 50:13.780
It'll be the last thing you do.

50:24.980 --> 50:27.690
Please...

50:27.740 --> 50:29.900
No!

50:40.980 --> 50:44.490
I have seen too many men
die. The bloodshed must end.

50:44.540 --> 50:46.170
We are in agreement.

50:46.220 --> 50:50.690
Atlantis must be ruled
by consent, not brutality.

50:50.740 --> 50:53.010
Then you have my support.

50:54.060 --> 50:55.650
The army will not oppose us?

50:55.700 --> 50:57.900
Not while I command it.

51:02.860 --> 51:07.370
All I ask is that there are
no reprisals against my men.

51:07.420 --> 51:10.570
I will not see them punished
for following orders.

51:10.620 --> 51:12.930
Those that swear loyalty
will be spared.

51:12.980 --> 51:16.900
Those that cannot are free to
leave the city, never to return.

51:18.140 --> 51:20.010
You have my word.

51:20.900 --> 51:23.440
You should return to Atlantis.

51:23.940 --> 51:25.970
I will tell the high priest
to make preparations.

51:26.020 --> 51:30.410
Once you have the blessing of the
gods, no-one will dare oppose you.

51:30.460 --> 51:32.290
And how do I know I can trust you?

51:32.340 --> 51:34.340
You have my word...

51:35.020 --> 51:37.060
.. as I have yours.

51:38.620 --> 51:41.740
It seems we will have to trust
each other, if this is to end.

51:48.180 --> 51:50.580
We will return to Atlantis.

51:52.820 --> 51:54.160
Jason.

52:16.780 --> 52:19.180
You don't trust him? Goran.

52:21.820 --> 52:24.530
Are we really to believe he'll
let us stroll back into Atlantis?

52:24.580 --> 52:25.810
Jason trusts him.

52:25.860 --> 52:29.930
Jason thinks everyone's
as honourable as he is.

52:29.980 --> 52:33.330
- Perhaps no-one's completely honourable.
- I suppose we have no choice.

52:33.380 --> 52:36.050
We have to put our faith in him.

52:59.700 --> 53:02.130
I'd started to doubt
I would ever return.

53:02.180 --> 53:05.860
You must prepare yourself. It's
not the same city that you left.

53:08.140 --> 53:10.260
I know.

53:45.820 --> 53:48.700
What I did was unforgivable.

53:50.220 --> 53:52.090
I am truly sorry.

53:53.060 --> 53:56.460
There must be forgiveness
if there is to be peace.

53:57.460 --> 54:00.960
We should all strive to
put the past behind us.

54:07.540 --> 54:10.280
I will serve you in any way I can.

54:12.660 --> 54:17.340
Every man has sworn an oath of
loyalty. This is your army now.

54:28.740 --> 54:31.090
Next time we meet, you'll be King.

54:31.140 --> 54:33.680
Thank you for all you've done.

54:34.860 --> 54:37.460
I won't forget it.

54:40.340 --> 54:42.850
The preparations have been made.

54:42.900 --> 54:46.540
At dawn tomorrow, you will
receive the gods' blessing.

54:47.540 --> 54:51.130
You will rule Atlantis
as King and Queen.

54:51.180 --> 54:53.300
Thank you, Melas.

55:17.500 --> 55:19.300
Ariadne?

55:29.740 --> 55:31.770
What's wrong?

55:31.820 --> 55:36.170
Being here again. It no
longer feels like my home.

55:36.220 --> 55:40.930
After everything that's happened,
it was always going to feel strange,

55:40.980 --> 55:45.410
but we've retaken the city with
hardly a drop of blood being shed.

55:45.460 --> 55:49.060
I know. It's... it's more than
we could ever have hoped for.

55:53.140 --> 55:56.240
There is something
troubling you, though?

55:56.740 --> 55:58.780
Tell me.

56:02.340 --> 56:04.380
It's Pasiphae.

56:06.220 --> 56:08.690
She said something to me.

56:08.740 --> 56:10.860
What?

56:14.940 --> 56:18.970
There is nothing that she
would like more than to...

56:19.020 --> 56:21.130
to sow doubt in your mind.

56:21.180 --> 56:25.100
You... you can't believe
anything that she said.

56:32.420 --> 56:34.460
You're right.

56:36.260 --> 56:38.800
Nothing should spoil this day.

57:14.940 --> 57:19.010
Well, for once, that was easier
than I thought it was going to be.

57:19.060 --> 57:21.010
We should celebrate.

57:21.060 --> 57:24.970
We have beds and food and fine wine.

57:26.540 --> 57:28.690
Lots and lots of fine wine.

57:28.740 --> 57:31.850
Burying your head in a wineskin
is your answer to everything.

57:31.900 --> 57:34.290
It solves nothing.

57:34.340 --> 57:35.330
Nothing.

57:35.380 --> 57:37.210
What's got into you?

57:37.260 --> 57:40.140
Pythagoras? Where are you going?

57:41.900 --> 57:44.370
There's something I must do.

58:00.300 --> 58:03.130
Pythagoras? What are you doing here?

58:03.180 --> 58:05.720
We have returned to the city.

58:06.220 --> 58:09.340
- What do you mean?
- Cilix is dead.

58:10.820 --> 58:14.820
The army have pledged allegiance
to Jason and Ariadne.

58:14.900 --> 58:18.580
At dawn tomorrow, they will
be blessed by the gods...

58:19.540 --> 58:20.890
.. and they will take the throne.

58:20.940 --> 58:22.610
Then it's over?

58:22.660 --> 58:25.010
Apparently so.

58:25.060 --> 58:29.420
Oh, this... this is better news
than we could ever have hoped for.

58:30.500 --> 58:33.440
Surely this is cause for celebration?

58:34.100 --> 58:36.370
I can take no joy in it.

58:37.020 --> 58:38.420
Why not?

58:43.620 --> 58:46.160
What happened to your father?

58:48.540 --> 58:50.740
What happened to him?

58:54.260 --> 58:58.140
He was arrested for helping
you retrieve Pandora's box.

58:59.140 --> 59:01.740
They beat him and tortured him.

59:02.820 --> 59:04.960
He was close to death.

59:09.380 --> 59:11.850
That is why you betrayed us.

59:12.820 --> 59:14.300
You knew?

59:17.460 --> 59:19.130
How?

59:19.180 --> 59:20.930
When?

59:20.980 --> 59:23.780
When we were ambushed in the arena.

59:24.340 --> 59:27.290
You were the only person who
could have revealed our plan.

59:27.340 --> 59:30.440
You knew when we met
at the hunting lodge?

59:33.020 --> 59:37.410
We assumed whatever I told you
would find its way back to Cilix.

59:37.460 --> 59:39.810
- We used you to set a trap for him.
- Pythagoras.

59:39.860 --> 59:42.810
- You betrayed me.
- My father was close to death.

59:42.860 --> 59:46.730
They said if I helped them,
they would release him.

59:46.780 --> 59:49.100
I didn't want to do it.

59:50.300 --> 59:52.690
But I couldn't just
watch my father die.

59:52.740 --> 59:55.530
You would have seen others
die in his place?

59:55.580 --> 01:00:00.290
Jason, Hercules, Ariadne. Your
betrayal nearly cost their lives.

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.010
I'm sorry.

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:04.540
You would have seen me die?

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.440
I mean nothing to you.

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:10.410
You mean...

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:13.020
everything to me.

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.210
You cannot say that.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.060
I had no choice.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:24.820
There is always a choice.

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.780
I understand...

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:40.690
.. the reasons why you did it...

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:46.370
.. but I will never forgive you.

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.490
Please.

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:52.530
Pythagoras.

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:55.050
Please. I... I'm sorry. I...

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:05.920
I couldn't bear the
thought of losing you.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:08.420
I had to do it.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:14.500
- But I will hate myself forever.
- You poor boy.

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.250
Pythagoras will never forgive me.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.770
I'm afraid that may be true.

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:45.250
- Oh.
- Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.810
Don't get up.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.740
I was just enjoying the night air.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.580
And some wine.

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.130
Is everything all right?
Where's Jason?

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.290
He's sleeping.

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:08.380
That boy is a constant
source of worry for me.

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.450
You're a good friend to him.

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:15.610
I don't know about that.

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.800
- I do my best.
- Hm.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.810
Sometimes I wish I had friends
like you and Pythagoras.

01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:25.130
Someone I could talk to.

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:32.410
I know it's not my place to ask,
but is everything all right?

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:34.500
I cannot sleep.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:39.380
You've a big day ahead of you tomorrow.
You're bound to be nervous.

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:43.610
It isn't nerves.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.540
What is it?

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.050
Jason.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:51.330
The way he was when
his heart blackened.

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:54.770
I fear the memory of it
will haunt us forever.

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:58.770
Those were troubling times, but
Jason's put it all behind him now.

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:02.260
- Has he?
- Why do you say that?

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.770
Because Pasiphae said him and
Medea had become intimate.

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.780
No.

01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:10.810
He... he wouldn't.

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:12.690
She told me he was unfaithful to me.

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:15.490
That witch would have done
anything to tear you apart.

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.130
Lies, all lies.

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.780
I know I shouldn't believe her.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:24.290
But when Jason talks of Medea,
I know he is hiding something.

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.420
I see it in his face.

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.890
They have a bond I
can never understand.

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:33.450
But it's you he married.
It's you he loves.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.900
If it is true, I'm not
sure I can forgive him.

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:41.540
Tomorrow you will receive the blessing
of the gods. A new dawn.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.700
You must put these thoughts
from your mind.

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.620
I'm not sure I can.

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:53.740
Something has changed in him,
and it will never be the same.

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.580
With me.

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.330
Goran. How good of you to join me.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.260
How can this be?

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:42.330
- I believed you to be dead.
- I was.

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.460
For a brief time.

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.290
But now I am returned.

01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:50.650
The throne is no longer yours.

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.090
And you think that is
your decision to make?

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:54.680
Seize her!

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.260
I gave you an order! Seize her!

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.530
It seems you face a choice.

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.500
Loyalty.

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.720
It's such a fickle notion.

01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.730
I cannot stand by any longer.

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:25.650
How many more men will you see die
to satisfy your lust for power?

01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:28.570
As many as it takes.

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:31.930
Those of you who swear
allegiance to me shall live.

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:34.570
You have my word.

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:39.530
I will never kneel
before you, Pasiphae.

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:44.010
Hormei khiliadon andron
mune soi epeimi.

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:48.120
It seems you are mistaken.

01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:00.100
And those of you who defy me...

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.730
.. shall die with their general.

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:13.820
Your Majesty.

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:34.090
The palace guard have agreed
to side with Pasiphae.

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:37.540
We strike before the gods
give their blessing.

01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.580
You look beautiful.

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.090
Ready?

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.060
Yes.

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.810
You are ready to receive
the blessing of the gods?

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:55.300
We are.

01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:00.700
Ennosigaie pater...

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.570
.. theiois en domasi tutois.

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:09.180
Ennosigaie pater, theiois
en domasi tutois.

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:14.930
O gaieokhe su deomesth'
oiktiremen hemon,

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.410
phrena kai kata thuumon.

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:21.899
O gaieokhe su deomesth'
oiktiremen hemon...

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:26.979
.. sebomen se kata phrena
kai kata thuumon.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:30.649
Ennosigaie pater theiois...

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:38.700
O gaieokhe su deomesth'
oiktiremen hemon.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:01.290
- Here.
- Jason!

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:07.210
They would defile the temple?
I will not allow it.

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:10.200
- Melas, no.
- Put down your swords.

01:09:28.779 --> 01:09:30.130
You.

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:33.420
You dare violate this sacred place?

01:09:37.899 --> 01:09:39.300
No!

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.700
Run.

01:09:53.819 --> 01:09:55.620
Come with us.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.340
Jason!

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:28.900
We won't escape the city in daylight.
We need to find a place to hide.

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:33.260
Move it! Move it!

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:50.890
I don't think anyone saw us.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:55.410
- You're bleeding?
- It's nothing.

01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:02.580
Send every soldier we have. Tear
this city apart! I want them found!

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:10.170
I killed her. I swear to
you. Pasiphae was dead.

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:13.370
We wait here until nightfall.

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:16.540
- And then?
- We try to escape the city.

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:30.940
Are you hurt?

01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:34.170
Melas always cared for me.

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:36.180
I'm sorry.

01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:46.180
I know he betrayed you. He
was trying to protect me.

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.370
He was a good man.

01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:51.820
I know.

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:08.660
Search every house and every store!

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.010
Father! Father!

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.420
What? What's happening?

01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:21.530
Pasiphae has retaken the city.

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.530
Will that woman never stop?

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.850
There are rumours that Jason and Queen
Ariadne have escaped into the lower town.

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.570
Soldiers are everywhere,
tearing it apart.

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:30.250
- And Pythagoras?
- I don't know.

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.410
I presume he's with them.
I have to help him.

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:36.650
No, no, no! You'll be cut down before
you can get anywhere near them.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:39.730
After all that I have done,
I have to do something.

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:43.010
- Don't try and stop me.
- Stop you?

01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:45.090
You foolish boy.

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:47.280
I'm going to help you.

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:54.610
Have they been found?

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:58.060
Not yet, but the city's
sealed. There's no escape.

01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:03.610
Let it be known that anyone sheltering
them shall be hung up in the streets.

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:07.660
Let's see just how quickly they
turn against their new king.

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.810
Are you sure this is going to work?

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:37.090
In life, the only thing you can
be truly certain of is death.

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:38.850
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:43.780
I could tell you that I'm completely
confident of success, if that would help.

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:18.240
I don't think we're
going to escape this.

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:22.170
At least we are together.

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:29.320
If this is the end, there's
something I must know.

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:34.600
Medea.

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.480
What happened between you two?

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:45.530
In the dark times...

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:51.440
.. there was a moment between us.

01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:54.780
It's over now.

01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:58.520
Medea has returned to Colchis.

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:02.480
I'm never going to see her again.

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:21.810
There's soldiers everywhere.

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:23.810
- How many?
- Too many to fight.

01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:25.610
No!

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.930
They're coming this way.

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:12.650
- Ready?
- Not really.

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:16.770
Remember that the wings
are sealed with wax,

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:20.210
and if the sun is too
hot, the wax will melt

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:24.250
and you will plummet to the ground
and almost certainly die.

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.690
It is night. There is no sun.

01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:28.680
Mm-hm. All right, you should be fine.

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:32.010
But remember, don't flap. Glide.

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:37.210
Glide and soar like an eagle.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.770
An eagle?

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.770
Well, go on. Go on, then.

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.370
- Aagh!
- No!

01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:49.650
Don't flap! Don't flap!

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.780
Aagh! Oh!

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.890
Ah!

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:01.340
Oh! My son!

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:06.260
Ah!

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:09.700
He's flying.

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:15.020
Any bright ideas?

01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:18.530
Right. See you in Hades.

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:37.130
What was that?

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:38.900
Fire powder.

01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:09.050
What in the name of
the gods was that?

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.420
Icarus. It's Icarus.

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.320
- He's flying?
- It would appear so.

01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.210
Come on!

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.040
Let's keep moving.

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.250
Icarus!

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:40.300
Pythagoras!

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:42.530
No!

01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:44.700
Icarus?

01:18:57.540 --> 01:18:59.540
No...

01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:02.620
Icarus!

01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:12.540
I'm sorry.

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:40.260
If you've quite finished,
we have to flee the city.

01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:13.850
O thanate,

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:19.770
psuukhas tautas nuun pempe
thanonton teele pros oluusion

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:22.810

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:24.940
peirata gaios.

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:37.210
I was praying for Melas.

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:41.520
There has been so much bloodshed.

01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:46.200
Will we ever be free of Pasiphae?

01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:51.540
It will be difficult...

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:54.380
.. but not impossible.

01:20:57.460 --> 01:21:00.260
Pasiphae will only be vanquished...

01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:03.780
.. if you find the source
of her power and destroy it.

01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:07.770
What is the source of her power?

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:14.380
There is a golden fleece, woven
long ago by the Stygian witches.

01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:19.260
No mortal man has ever seen it.

01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:23.570
The power it has is...

01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:25.290
unimaginable.

01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:27.970
Where can I find it?

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:31.820
In Colchis.

01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:36.120
You will need great courage...

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:39.000
.. and huge sacrifice.

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:43.740
Even then, you will
not succeed alone.

01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:49.440
There's only one person
who can help you.

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:50.820
Who?

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:01.580
You already know the
answer to that question.

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:05.620
Medea.

01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:16.210
Not Colchis.

01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:18.330
- Anywhere but Colchis.
- That's where it is.

01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:21.730
It is the land of witches
and dark magic.

01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:24.730
The stories I've heard. It's
the stuff of nightmares.

01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:27.090
I hate to say it, but a man
should know when he's beaten.

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:30.050
- You... you did everything you could.
- I don't have a choice.

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:33.580
There will never be peace
until Pasiphae is defeated.

01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:01.380
When I came here, the Oracle told me
it was my destiny to save the city.

01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:06.580
And as much as I want to,
I... I can't forget that.

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:08.650
I know.

01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:13.050
Pasiphae will only be defeated when
I destroy the source of her power.

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:15.640
That's why I have to go away.

01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:17.200
Where?

01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:22.410
Colchis.

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:24.410
It's the only way.

01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:26.890
- Then I will go with you.
- No.

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:29.930
It's too dangerous.
I have to go alone.

01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:33.080
Then who is to protect
you from yourself?

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:41.300
If Pasiphae is to be defeated,
then we'll do it together.

01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:27.960
We won't make the harbour
by nightfall.

01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:30.880
We should set up camp.

01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:59.930
He's coming. He's coming.

01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:02.420
He's coming.
