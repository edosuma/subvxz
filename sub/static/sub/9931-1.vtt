01:09.622 --> 01:11.249
Excuse us.

01:11.290 --> 01:14.282
Jeez, get a room or something.

01:14.327 --> 01:16.261
All right!

01:16.295 --> 01:18.763
They're getting charged
for those.

01:18.798 --> 01:20.891
Those books aren't cheap,
either.

01:20.933 --> 01:23.265
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

01:26.773 --> 01:28.764
<i>Hey, Gerry,</i>
<i>isn't that your bus?</i>

01:28.808 --> 01:30.537
<i>Great way</i>
<i>to start the summer.</i>

01:30.576 --> 01:34.410
Wait! Stop the bus! Stop!

01:34.447 --> 01:37.780
<i>Ha ha ha!</i>
<i>Go, fat boy, go!</i>

01:37.817 --> 01:41.617
<i># Everybody wants to live,</i>
<i>and they want to live #</i>

01:41.654 --> 01:46.455
<i># And everybody wants to love,</i>
<i>and they want to love #</i>

01:46.492 --> 01:50.155
<i># Everybody wants to be #</i>

01:50.196 --> 01:53.791
<i># Closer to free #</i>

01:53.833 --> 01:56.461
<i># Yeah, and yeah, yeah #</i>

01:56.502 --> 01:58.800
<i># Everybody wants respect #</i>

01:58.838 --> 02:00.305
<i>Foul ball! Strike two!</i>

02:00.339 --> 02:02.068
<i>Little help here, son.</i>

02:02.108 --> 02:04.235
<i>Come on. Toss it over.</i>

02:04.277 --> 02:06.040
<i># Once in a while #</i>

02:06.078 --> 02:07.443
Unh!

02:09.514 --> 02:11.608
Give it another try, son.

02:11.651 --> 02:13.118
Right here!

02:15.021 --> 02:17.455
Over the fence, son!

02:19.459 --> 02:22.121
Here!

02:22.161 --> 02:23.719
Unh!

02:32.104 --> 02:35.505
<i># Everybody one,</i>
<i>everybody two #</i>

02:35.541 --> 02:39.477
<i># Everybody three #</i>

02:39.512 --> 02:43.778
<i># Everybody needs to touch,</i>
<i>you know, now and then #</i>

02:43.816 --> 02:48.776
<i># And everybody wants</i>
<i>a good, good friend #</i>

02:48.821 --> 02:52.655
<i># Everybody wants to be</i>
<i>closer to free #</i>

02:52.692 --> 02:54.819
Lemonade, lemonade.

03:00.666 --> 03:02.031
<i># Everybody wants to live #</i>

03:02.068 --> 03:03.729
<i># And they want to live #</i>

03:05.771 --> 03:08.069
<i>Mom!</i>

03:08.107 --> 03:12.271
<i># Everybody wants to be #</i>

03:12.311 --> 03:15.303
<i># Closer to free #</i>

03:22.555 --> 03:23.920
Hello?

03:23.956 --> 03:25.423
<i>We're in here, honey.</i>

03:25.458 --> 03:26.789
<i>Come on, son.</i>

03:28.594 --> 03:30.494
Why is everybody home?

03:30.530 --> 03:32.623
Did someone die?

03:34.800 --> 03:36.290
Who's this?

03:38.204 --> 03:41.196
Hi, Gerry. Roger Johnson.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.265
Islanders fan, huh?

03:43.309 --> 03:45.436
Team of the future, I say.

03:45.478 --> 03:48.447
Yeah.
Whatever, I'm out of here.

03:48.481 --> 03:50.449
Hold those horses, cowboy.

03:50.483 --> 03:52.110
Mr. Johnson is your guest...

03:52.151 --> 03:56.611
and he's here to talk to you
about a special summer camp.

03:56.656 --> 03:59.216
A camp designed
just for you, Gerry.

03:59.258 --> 04:01.123
Summer camp? No way!

04:01.160 --> 04:03.754
I have plans for the summer.
I'm gonna hang out!

04:03.796 --> 04:06.458
Come on, honey.
He's got a videotape.

04:06.499 --> 04:08.228
Why don't
we take a little peek?

04:08.267 --> 04:10.132
Why don't we not?

04:14.606 --> 04:17.166
<i>Greetings, future campers.</i>

04:17.209 --> 04:21.269
I'm Alice Bushkin,
and this is Harvey...

04:21.313 --> 04:23.747
and we've been
the owners and operators...

04:23.782 --> 04:27.843
of Camp Hope
for 32 wonderful summers.

04:27.886 --> 04:31.219
Won't you join us for number 33?

04:37.529 --> 04:40.555
Whoa!

04:40.599 --> 04:41.930
Hmm.

04:43.802 --> 04:45.861
<i>What's that?</i>

04:45.904 --> 04:47.735
This is called "the Blob."

04:47.773 --> 04:49.502
"The Blob," huh?

04:49.541 --> 04:52.942
<i>You can go</i>
<i>as high as 15 feet.</i>

04:52.978 --> 04:54.605
Wow.

04:59.551 --> 05:01.849
Wow, go-karts.

05:01.887 --> 05:03.616
<i>How many times</i>
<i>can you go on the go-karts?</i>

05:03.655 --> 05:05.555
<i>As much as you want, Gerry.</i>

05:05.590 --> 05:08.855
But be careful.
They can be addicting.

05:11.263 --> 05:12.753
I'm only kidding.

05:12.798 --> 05:14.891
Hi, I'm Pat Finley!

05:14.933 --> 05:16.901
I've been coming here
since I was 10 years old.

05:16.935 --> 05:18.232
Want to know why?

05:18.270 --> 05:20.738
Because Camp Hope
is the fun way to lose weight.

05:20.772 --> 05:22.740
It's a fat camp!

05:22.774 --> 05:26.210
Are you crazy? No way!

05:26.244 --> 05:29.441
I'm not going to a camp
with a bunch of fat-loads!

05:29.481 --> 05:32.450
- Gerry!
- That's not kind, Gerry.

05:32.484 --> 05:34.452
We are doing this
for your own good.

05:34.486 --> 05:36.317
We gotta nip this thing
in the bud.

05:36.354 --> 05:40.950
I'm fine.
This is a joke, right?

05:40.992 --> 05:43.051
You're fatter than I am.
Why don't you go?

05:43.095 --> 05:46.030
You show your father
some respect.

05:46.064 --> 05:48.430
I think we should have
a little powwow...

05:48.467 --> 05:52.631
and we will call you
with our decision later.

05:52.671 --> 05:55.196
I'll give you my decision
right now.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.901
I'm not going.

06:02.147 --> 06:04.206
<i>This is</i>
<i>Captain Harris speaking...</i>

06:06.318 --> 06:08.718
<i>...cruising altitude</i>
<i>of 29,000 feet.</i>

06:08.754 --> 06:11.018
<i>Those of you on the left side</i>
<i>of the aircraft...</i>

06:11.056 --> 06:13.047
<i>have a nice view of</i>
<i>the Blue Ridge Mountains.</i>

06:13.091 --> 06:15.116
Hey, there, Mr. Rainy Day.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.458
I've got a little surprise
for you.

06:17.496 --> 06:19.361
Hmm?

06:19.397 --> 06:20.694
Huh?

06:20.732 --> 06:22.131
<i>...but in your seats...</i>

06:22.167 --> 06:24.727
<i>we request that you keep</i>
<i>your seat belts fastened.</i>

06:24.770 --> 06:26.601
Cutie.

06:26.638 --> 06:29.038
Great.

06:34.546 --> 06:37.242
Headed to fat camp?

06:37.282 --> 06:40.217
No. Why do you say that?

06:40.252 --> 06:43.221
Because you're fat.
Is that your dad?

06:43.255 --> 06:47.123
No. Why do you say that?

06:47.159 --> 06:50.219
Because he's fat, too.

06:50.262 --> 06:51.923
Well, so are you.

06:51.963 --> 06:53.760
I know. That's why
I'm going to fat camp.

06:53.799 --> 06:56.666
- I'm Roy.
- I'm Gerry.

06:57.969 --> 06:59.732
I guess I'm going.

06:59.771 --> 07:00.931
I knew it!

07:00.972 --> 07:02.530
And that's your dad, too,
isn't it?

07:02.574 --> 07:05.202
- Hell no!
- You'll love camp, man.

07:05.243 --> 07:06.403
Camp is awesome.

07:06.444 --> 07:09.379
No one picks on you because
you're not the fat kid.

07:09.414 --> 07:11.848
Everybody's the fat kid.

07:11.883 --> 07:15.148
Stick with me, Gerry,
because I'm the man.

07:16.688 --> 07:20.715
Mr. Bushkin tells the scariest
ghost stories you ever heard.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.721
Yes, have no fear,
I have returned.

07:24.763 --> 07:26.890
I got a rookie here,
and his name's Gerry...

07:26.932 --> 07:28.923
so show him
the same amount of respect...

07:28.967 --> 07:31.492
that you show me--none.

07:43.782 --> 07:45.079
Excuse me!

07:45.116 --> 07:47.084
I'm looking for
several portly adolescents.

07:47.118 --> 07:49.211
That's us.
You're looking good, Pat.

07:49.254 --> 07:51.745
Tell me something
I don't know.

07:51.790 --> 07:54.224
Let's load her up!

07:54.259 --> 07:56.352
Hey, hey!
How you doing, guys?

07:56.394 --> 07:59.090
- Phillip, how are you?
- This is Gerry.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.927
Hey, Gerry.
I'm Pat Finley.

08:00.966 --> 08:02.695
I'm sure you recognize me
from my work...

08:02.734 --> 08:05.532
in the Camp Hope
promotional video.

08:05.570 --> 08:07.231
We have
a little tradition, Gerry.

08:07.272 --> 08:09.206
The new guy drives to camp.
Right, guys?

08:09.241 --> 08:12.267
Keep it under 70.
We got some weird local cops.

08:12.310 --> 08:13.743
You drive a stick, right?

08:13.778 --> 08:15.746
No, but I can try.

08:15.780 --> 08:17.714
No, no, no.
Sorry, cannot risk it.

08:17.749 --> 08:20.718
Come here a second.
I gotta ask you something.

08:20.752 --> 08:22.583
Something very serious.

08:23.922 --> 08:27.050
Are you ready for the best
damn summer of your life?

08:27.092 --> 08:28.992
Yeah!

08:29.027 --> 08:31.222
<i>Is everybody gonna</i>
<i>behave themselves this summer?</i>

08:31.263 --> 08:34.494
<i>- No!</i>
<i>- Good! That's what I expect!</i>

08:34.532 --> 08:38.229
<i>Can't do it.</i>
<i>Gotta get back to the camp!</i>

08:38.270 --> 08:40.397
<i>- Pull over, please!</i>
<i>- Don't bug me!</i>

08:40.438 --> 08:43.270
<i>- All right!</i>
<i>- Yeah!</i>

08:43.308 --> 08:45.572
<i>Ha ha!</i>
<i>Psyched you out!</i>

08:45.610 --> 08:47.942
<i>- You stink, Pat!</i>
<i>- That's not funny!</i>

08:47.979 --> 08:49.970
<i>I thought that was</i>
<i>pretty amusing, myself.</i>

08:51.449 --> 08:53.246
<i>Garner, where you from?</i>

08:53.285 --> 08:56.311
<i>- Long Island.</i>
<i>- Never heard of it.</i>

09:00.792 --> 09:03.522
<i>Sam, don't lean</i>
<i>your head out the window.</i>

09:03.561 --> 09:05.529
<i>We lost six kids</i>
<i>like that last summer.</i>

09:05.563 --> 09:07.360
<i>I'm not going</i>
<i>to pick up your head.</i>

09:07.399 --> 09:09.367
<i>I don't need it anyway!</i>

09:09.401 --> 09:13.701
<i>Camp Hope, everybody!</i>
<i>Best place on earth!</i>

09:16.241 --> 09:19.608
<i>Camp Hope!</i>
<i>Camp Hope! Camp Hope!</i>

09:19.644 --> 09:22.272
Camp Hope!
Camp Hope! Camp Hope!

09:40.365 --> 09:41.992
Mm-hmm.

09:42.033 --> 09:46.197
All right, now in
a nice, orderly fashion...

09:46.237 --> 09:47.534
get off my bus!

09:49.207 --> 09:50.504
<i>It's stuck!</i>

09:50.542 --> 09:53.238
<i>I don't know what to do!</i>
<i>It's stuck!</i>

10:02.053 --> 10:04.749
- Heads up!
- Unh!

10:04.789 --> 10:06.347
<i>Here's another one!</i>

10:06.391 --> 10:07.688
Hey, bony butt.

10:07.725 --> 10:09.750
How was your year,
chicken legs?

10:09.794 --> 10:11.386
It's not funny, guys.

10:11.429 --> 10:12.828
Why are they teasing him?

10:12.864 --> 10:14.695
That's a counselor named Tim.

10:14.732 --> 10:16.859
He used to be one of us,
but then he lost weight...

10:16.901 --> 10:18.528
so we give him
a hard time about it.

10:18.570 --> 10:21.095
- He's cool, though.
- Let's hear it.

10:21.139 --> 10:23.869
Tim, what happened,
did you have a baby?

10:23.908 --> 10:26.399
<i>That's funny.</i>

10:26.444 --> 10:29.641
Just because I got these
great, skinny buns of steel.

10:29.681 --> 10:31.273
Whoo! Look at that--
all tight and toned.

10:31.316 --> 10:32.943
Bet you wish they were yours.

10:32.984 --> 10:34.781
Don't you?
Take a look, boys!

10:34.819 --> 10:36.616
The envy of the entire camp--

10:36.654 --> 10:40.818
Up there is the bald eagle,
which is a single breed...

10:43.828 --> 10:46.126
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:46.164 --> 10:48.758
I'm Julie, the new nurse.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.132
Pat.

10:51.169 --> 10:53.034
Pat, I'm a little lost.

10:53.071 --> 10:55.938
Can you tell me
where the infirmary is?

11:00.578 --> 11:02.546
<i>Well, let's see...</i>

11:02.580 --> 11:06.311
Uh...No.

11:06.351 --> 11:10.879
Oh, well...I'll find it.

11:10.922 --> 11:12.321
Nice to meet you.

11:18.062 --> 11:20.553
Pat, you've been coming here
since you were ten...

11:20.598 --> 11:23.260
and you don't know
where the infirmary is?

11:23.301 --> 11:25.792
I panicked.

11:25.837 --> 11:27.930
What are we gonna do
with you, man?

11:27.972 --> 11:30.099
Help me with these bags,
all right?

11:30.141 --> 11:31.608
- Garner.
- Yeah?

11:31.643 --> 11:33.270
Let's get working
on this trunk.

11:33.311 --> 11:34.608
OK.

11:34.646 --> 11:37.114
- You got a girlfriend?
- Oh, no.

11:37.148 --> 11:39.946
So you broke up with her
before the summer...

11:39.984 --> 11:41.781
so you could be free
to play the field, huh?

11:41.819 --> 11:44.447
Yeah,
you gotta play the field.

11:44.489 --> 11:47.287
Yeah, I break up with
my girlfriend every summer.

11:47.325 --> 11:48.758
You gotta be free, you know?

11:48.793 --> 11:50.283
All right, put it down.

11:50.328 --> 11:51.886
This is it, Gerry.

11:51.930 --> 11:54.592
I've been the counselor
in here for 10 years.

11:54.632 --> 11:55.963
I hope you're ready.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.798
You'll be hanging with
some pretty cool cats.

12:01.339 --> 12:02.704
Josh, how you doing, man?

12:02.740 --> 12:04.071
Roy.

12:04.108 --> 12:08.602
I just saw the new nurse,
and she's very attractive.

12:10.114 --> 12:11.445
This pleases me.

12:13.117 --> 12:14.982
<i>Here it is!</i>

12:15.019 --> 12:19.012
Ah, Chez Chipmunk--
my summer home.

12:19.057 --> 12:20.524
What do we got here?

12:20.558 --> 12:24.460
Gerry, this is Josh,
camp legend.

12:24.495 --> 12:26.520
Aye-aye, Captain, sir.

12:26.564 --> 12:28.327
All present and accounted for,
Captain, sir.

12:28.366 --> 12:30.857
What's the matter?
You're not a captain?

12:30.902 --> 12:32.426
No.

12:32.470 --> 12:34.404
Then maybe you
should lose the wings.

12:36.908 --> 12:38.375
Welcome to
the Chipmunk bunk, Captain--

12:38.409 --> 12:40.343
the best bunk
in the entire camp.

12:40.378 --> 12:41.777
<i>Yep! Sure is.</i>

12:41.813 --> 12:45.180
You guys aren't gonna call me
Captain all summer, are you?

12:45.216 --> 12:46.979
Yes, sir, Captain!

12:47.018 --> 12:48.918
Captain, looks like
you're all set here.

12:48.953 --> 12:50.386
I gotta take care of
some other stuff.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.252
You're the best, Pat.

12:52.290 --> 12:54.053
All right, take it easy.

12:54.092 --> 12:57.289
All right, Gerry, over here
is your brand-new bunk.

12:57.328 --> 12:58.795
Don't tell anybody...

12:58.830 --> 13:03.733
but I snuck in some Oreos
for emergencies.

13:03.768 --> 13:06.236
That was very sneaky of you.

13:06.270 --> 13:10.036
Chipmunks!
Download, now!

13:22.420 --> 13:25.218
<i>New kid! Yo!</i>

13:25.256 --> 13:26.553
Come on over here!

13:26.591 --> 13:29.754
Get these salamis off my back.
They really hurt.

13:34.632 --> 13:36.759
Phillip, look at this.

13:36.801 --> 13:38.428
That's pretty nice, Nicholas...

13:38.469 --> 13:41.461
but look at this.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.171
Yes!

13:52.583 --> 13:54.949
Crikey!

13:54.986 --> 13:57.750
I knew it was too hot
in that bus.

14:01.025 --> 14:03.721
This is definitely not sanitary.

14:03.761 --> 14:06.821
Everyone!
Grab a taste of England, guys!

15:01.485 --> 15:03.214
You'll love the Bushkins.

15:03.253 --> 15:04.720
Every year
they surprise us...

15:04.755 --> 15:06.222
with something cool
for the camp.

15:06.256 --> 15:07.723
Last year
they got us the Blob...

15:07.758 --> 15:10.454
and this year I hear
they're getting us jet skis.

15:10.494 --> 15:13.258
- Jet skis!
- Here they come.

15:16.933 --> 15:20.232
- You'll love these people.
- Really?

15:24.274 --> 15:26.242
Greetings, campers.

15:26.276 --> 15:30.440
Hi! Hi! Hiya!

15:30.480 --> 15:32.744
You'll get it.

15:32.783 --> 15:36.241
That's the greatest sound
I've heard in a long time.

15:36.286 --> 15:41.417
Harvey and I are saddened
and dismayed to announce...

15:41.458 --> 15:45.258
that we are no longer
the owners of Camp Hope.

15:45.295 --> 15:47.320
- What?
- What's going on?

15:47.364 --> 15:48.763
What are you talking about?

15:48.799 --> 15:51.165
Sometimes in life...

15:51.201 --> 15:54.728
things don't work out
the way you planned...

15:54.771 --> 15:58.263
and in those situations,
sometimes...

15:58.308 --> 16:02.404
you file Chapter 9
bankruptcy--Jesus!

16:02.446 --> 16:06.815
We worked our whole life,
and what do we have to show?

16:06.850 --> 16:09.717
Nothing! Nothing!

16:09.753 --> 16:11.448
Harvey, please stop.

16:11.488 --> 16:13.285
What?

16:13.323 --> 16:18.693
OK, kids, out with the old,
and in with the new.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.959
<i>It won't be the same</i>
<i>without them.</i>

16:21.998 --> 16:25.798
Your new owner will introduce
himself in a minute.

16:25.836 --> 16:28.168
But you know what I would like?

16:28.205 --> 16:31.971
Please, could you give us
just one more...

16:32.008 --> 16:37.105
Camp Hope "Hi, hi, hiya"?

16:37.147 --> 16:39.877
Hiya.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.942
God bless all of you.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.323
<i>We love you, Harvey!</i>

16:50.360 --> 16:52.760
<i>He's kidding, guys.</i>
<i>He's gotta be.</i>

16:52.796 --> 16:54.855
One word of advice.

16:54.898 --> 16:58.390
Never let anyone
sign your checks!

16:58.435 --> 16:59.834
Harvey, please.

16:59.870 --> 17:02.839
<i>You can't leave.</i>
<i>We need you.</i>

17:02.873 --> 17:05.467
<i>Come back.</i>

17:05.509 --> 17:07.875
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know, man.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.896
<i>Now, it's time to meet</i>
<i>your new owner and operator.</i>

17:26.930 --> 17:29.626
<i>Tony Perkis is a man</i>
<i>who believes in you.</i>

17:29.666 --> 17:32.134
<i>His life is dedicated</i>
<i>to saying things like...</i>

17:32.169 --> 17:34.296
<i>"Yes!" and</i>
<i>"You better believe it!"</i>

17:34.337 --> 17:37.704
<i>Entrepreneur, a motivator,</i>
<i>and a new friend...</i>

17:37.741 --> 17:41.939
<i>may I introduce</i>
<i>Tony Perkis!</i>

17:45.782 --> 17:49.240
Mm. Can you smell it?

17:49.286 --> 17:50.548
<i>What? No.</i>

17:50.587 --> 17:53.715
There's a life force
in here tonight.

17:53.757 --> 17:56.021
Do you feel it? Hmm?

17:56.059 --> 17:59.119
<i>I look around this room...</i>

17:59.162 --> 18:02.598
and I see potential.

18:04.701 --> 18:08.637
I see the future chairman
of a Fortune 500 company.

18:08.672 --> 18:10.333
I see a famous rap artist.

18:14.244 --> 18:18.010
I see the president of
the United States of America.

18:18.048 --> 18:19.982
He's from England.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.984
Being an only child...

18:22.018 --> 18:24.987
educated entirely by
private tutors my whole life...

18:25.021 --> 18:26.784
I'm looking forward
to interacting...

18:26.823 --> 18:28.586
with children
for the first time.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.456
I'm going to teach you...

18:30.493 --> 18:33.326
and I bet you might teach me
a little something, also.

18:34.764 --> 18:37.062
Now, those of you from
western Pennsylvania...

18:37.100 --> 18:39.591
probably know my father,
Tony Perkis Senior...

18:39.636 --> 18:41.399
the Lighting Fixture King.

18:41.438 --> 18:43.372
All the lights you'll see
around this camp...

18:43.406 --> 18:45.340
have been donated by him.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.249
But I'm gonna do
old Dad one better.

18:53.283 --> 18:55.808
I'm not gonna give you a light.

18:55.852 --> 18:58.821
I'm gonna show you the light!

18:58.855 --> 19:00.789
And to help me do it...

19:00.824 --> 19:03.054
let's meet the new staff
of Camp Hope.

19:03.093 --> 19:05.323
Team Perkis!

19:05.362 --> 19:08.695
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

19:10.500 --> 19:13.526
Ha! Ha! Ha!

19:13.570 --> 19:15.765
<i>All right!</i>
<i>Stand proud, boys!</i>

19:15.805 --> 19:18.865
Hey, who wants to be
on TV, huh?

19:18.908 --> 19:20.637
That's Kenny the cameraman.

19:20.677 --> 19:22.201
Hey, there, Kenny!

19:22.245 --> 19:24.145
If all goes
according to plan...

19:24.180 --> 19:26.375
we're gonna turn this summer
into the number-one...

19:26.416 --> 19:28.714
weight-loss infomercial
in the country!

19:28.752 --> 19:30.049
You're kidding.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.281
Kids, at age 12...

19:32.322 --> 19:35.723
I weighed 319 pounds.

19:35.759 --> 19:39.490
I had bad skin,
low self-esteem...

19:39.529 --> 19:41.793
and no self-respect.

19:41.831 --> 19:46.962
Now...I eat success
for breakfast!

19:47.003 --> 19:50.063
- With skim milk.
- Ugh.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.573
Pounds are gonna fly...

19:51.608 --> 19:55.738
and fat is
outta here, mister!

19:55.779 --> 19:58.646
And we are gonna do it together!

19:58.682 --> 20:00.616
Oh, my God.

20:00.650 --> 20:03.710
Ha! Haaa...

20:03.753 --> 20:05.345
Aah!

20:07.324 --> 20:09.315
<i>I want to go home!</i>

20:13.797 --> 20:16.561
The Bushkins always put me
in the Chipmunk bunk.

20:16.599 --> 20:18.032
I've been here for 10 years.

20:18.068 --> 20:19.535
According
to my information...

20:19.569 --> 20:21.366
you have been reassigned
to the big house.

20:21.404 --> 20:23.634
I don't think Tony would mind
if we switched back.

20:23.673 --> 20:27.370
That would make me
feel very uncomfortable.

20:27.410 --> 20:29.674
I'm gonna talk to Tony.

20:29.712 --> 20:33.808
Please do.
Let me get your bag.

20:37.687 --> 20:39.018
Unh!

20:44.327 --> 20:46.056
Good-bye now.

20:46.096 --> 20:48.564
Enjoy your summer.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.296
Hello!

20:53.336 --> 20:55.998
I am your new friend
and counselor!

20:56.039 --> 20:59.998
Please enjoy your new
Perkis system uniforms.

21:00.043 --> 21:02.568
Your families will be
billed automatically.

21:02.612 --> 21:04.739
Now, let's play the fun game...

21:04.781 --> 21:06.874
that helps us learn
each other's names.

21:06.916 --> 21:08.713
We already know
each other's names.

21:08.751 --> 21:10.514
Silence!

21:12.889 --> 21:16.723
You--please announce
everyone's name.

21:16.759 --> 21:21.059
OK. That's Roy.
That's Josh.

21:21.097 --> 21:24.066
Sam. That's Cody.
That's Nicholas.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.692
That's Michael. That's Phil.

21:25.735 --> 21:28.363
And I am Lars.

21:28.404 --> 21:31.840
"Lars"?
What kind of name is that?

21:31.875 --> 21:33.502
Where are you from?

21:37.814 --> 21:39.281
Far away.

21:40.517 --> 21:46.183
I must inform you I have
a severely deviated septum.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.655
When I sleep at night...

21:47.690 --> 21:49.783
I make
a very disturbing sound.

21:49.826 --> 21:52.124
Don't be alarmed.
I am fine.

21:52.162 --> 21:55.097
Now, go to sleep.

22:15.885 --> 22:19.753
Oh, no. I'm dead.

22:19.789 --> 22:21.518
I'm in Heaven.

22:21.558 --> 22:23.753
Roy? Roy.

22:23.793 --> 22:25.590
What's going on?

22:25.628 --> 22:27.425
<i>Wake up, campers.</i>

22:27.463 --> 22:29.328
<i>It's a glorious morning.</i>

22:29.365 --> 22:31.424
<i>Today is Evaluation Day.</i>

22:31.467 --> 22:33.765
<i>The key word here</i>
<i>is "value."</i>

22:33.803 --> 22:35.771
<i>Do you have any? Not yet.</i>

22:35.805 --> 22:37.272
<i>But by the end of the summer...</i>

22:37.307 --> 22:39.867
<i>this camp will be</i>
<i>filled with skinny winners!</i>

22:39.909 --> 22:42.844
"Skinny weiners"?
You hear that, guys?

22:42.879 --> 22:44.278
Do you think I'm crazy?

22:44.314 --> 22:46.782
I'm not crazy.
I just believe in you.

22:46.816 --> 22:50.274
And I believe in you.
Call and order now.

22:50.320 --> 22:54.051
All right,
let's go get our hands dirty.

22:54.090 --> 22:55.557
<i># Ahh, freak out! #</i>

22:55.592 --> 23:00.794
Glide! Stride!

23:00.830 --> 23:03.060
<i>Get your butt off the ground!</i>

23:03.099 --> 23:06.432
<i>Concentrate!</i>
<i>Find your center.</i>

23:06.469 --> 23:07.663
<i># Freak out! #</i>

23:10.240 --> 23:13.732
<i>Stride! Glide!</i>

23:13.776 --> 23:18.577
<i># Listen to us,</i>
<i>I'm sure you'll be amazed #</i>

23:18.615 --> 23:20.606
Stride!

23:20.650 --> 23:23.210
I'm feeling skinny, Tony.

23:23.253 --> 23:25.221
<i>So am I!</i>

23:25.255 --> 23:27.553
Aah!

23:27.590 --> 23:29.421
We keep this up,
I see no reason...

23:29.459 --> 23:31.984
why we can't beat Camp MVP
in the Apache Relay.

23:32.028 --> 23:34.258
What's an Apache Relay?

23:34.297 --> 23:37.892
It's a dumb inter-camp event
where those jocks at MVP...

23:37.934 --> 23:40.926
come over here and kick
our butts every year.

23:40.970 --> 23:43.495
<i># Ahh, freak out! #</i>

23:43.539 --> 23:46.770
Only film the ones
that are standing, Kenneth.

23:46.809 --> 23:48.538
Glide!

23:51.881 --> 23:54.782
141 pounds, Gerry Garner.

23:54.817 --> 23:56.944
Weight-loss goal, 17 pounds.

23:56.986 --> 23:59.750
Please step down. Next!

24:01.724 --> 24:05.956
Very fat, I see. 160 pounds.

24:05.995 --> 24:08.054
Weight-loss goal, 23 pounds.

24:09.699 --> 24:12.862
Ooh. Oh, my!

24:12.902 --> 24:15.200
Congratulations, Mr. Simms.

24:15.238 --> 24:17.399
You are the fattest boy in camp.

24:17.440 --> 24:20.238
All right,
let's hear it for Simms.

24:24.013 --> 24:25.241
Get down!

24:25.281 --> 24:26.748
<i># Ahh, freak out! #</i>

24:26.783 --> 24:29.547
<i># All that pressure</i>
<i>got you down #</i>

24:29.585 --> 24:31.177
Five and a quarter.

24:31.220 --> 24:34.246
<i># Has your head</i>
<i>spinning all around #</i>

24:34.290 --> 24:35.951
<i># Feel the rhythm #</i>

24:35.992 --> 24:38.517
<i># Chant the rhyme,</i>
<i>come on along #</i>

24:38.561 --> 24:39.755
<i>Big smile.</i>

24:39.796 --> 24:41.354
<i># And have a real good time #</i>

24:41.397 --> 24:43.763
<i>Turn around to your side.</i>

24:43.800 --> 24:45.791
Please put your fat finger down!

24:45.835 --> 24:47.029
<i># Freak out! #</i>

24:48.604 --> 24:50.265
<i># Ahh, freak out! #</i>

24:50.306 --> 24:52.570
You've broken my camera!

24:52.608 --> 24:54.576
No, no, no,
you listen to me.

24:54.610 --> 24:56.908
If I don't get a 50,000 unit
pre-sale on this video...

24:56.946 --> 24:58.777
my ass is wheat grass!

24:58.815 --> 25:00.680
Just hang on a second.

25:00.717 --> 25:03.185
Attention campers,
tonight's lecture is...

25:03.219 --> 25:06.814
"Liposuction:
Option or Obsession."

25:06.856 --> 25:10.121
Watch out for Salami Sam!

25:10.159 --> 25:13.492
<i>Whoa!</i>

25:13.529 --> 25:16.020
Hey, don't pee in the water!

25:16.065 --> 25:19.057
Don't drink the water.
He peed in it!

25:24.474 --> 25:27.773
- Nurse Julie!
- Whoa!

25:27.810 --> 25:30.472
Excuse me, Nurse Julie.

25:30.513 --> 25:33.243
I'm having a problem
with my sciatic nerve.

25:33.282 --> 25:36.877
Perhaps later you could give me
a deep-tissue massage.

25:36.919 --> 25:39.046
I'll pencil you in.

25:39.088 --> 25:41.386
Lars, shouldn't you be
watching the kids?

25:41.424 --> 25:44.052
Don't worry, I have them
on the body system.

25:44.093 --> 25:45.390
"Body system"?

25:45.428 --> 25:47.259
Yeah, have a look.

25:49.499 --> 25:53.869
Body!

25:53.903 --> 26:00.438
- Body!
- Body!

26:00.543 --> 26:03.706
"Buddy." Heh heh.

26:03.746 --> 26:07.580
You're obviously
a very powerful man, Lars.

26:07.617 --> 26:09.107
Would you excuse me?

26:12.188 --> 26:15.089
Yes, but with much difficulty!

26:18.261 --> 26:22.393
Buddy!

26:22.432 --> 26:25.230
All right, Gerry, it's your bat.

26:25.268 --> 26:27.202
Nicholas, you know what to do.

26:27.236 --> 26:28.897
Is this kind of like cricket?

26:28.938 --> 26:30.405
It's not kind of like cricket.

26:30.440 --> 26:33.238
It is cricket.
Just with a different name.

26:33.276 --> 26:35.574
MVPers are almost here.
Are the boys ready?

26:35.611 --> 26:38.409
Yeah. Tony, I really need
to talk to you about this.

26:38.448 --> 26:40.245
Our kids will get
their butts handed to them.

26:40.283 --> 26:41.773
Why don't we hold off on this?

26:41.818 --> 26:44.912
Thank you for telling me
how to run my camp.

26:44.954 --> 26:46.421
That I bought.

26:46.456 --> 26:50.187
This won't help those kids
get any better at sports!

26:50.226 --> 26:51.921
We're not teaching them
about sports!

26:51.961 --> 26:53.895
We're teaching them about life!

26:53.930 --> 26:55.693
Life.

27:00.036 --> 27:01.401
<i>Look!</i>

27:01.437 --> 27:04.372
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>
<i>Let's do it!</i>

27:04.407 --> 27:08.104
Go, go, go!

27:08.144 --> 27:09.907
I'm not so good at sports.

27:09.946 --> 27:12.005
Oh, yeah,
and I'm Deion Sanders.

27:12.048 --> 27:14.243
<i>We're dead, guys.</i>

27:15.751 --> 27:17.844
All right, I want to see
some hustle out there!

27:17.887 --> 27:20.219
- Hey, Chris.
- Pat, how you doing?

27:20.256 --> 27:22.053
See you got a promotion.

27:22.091 --> 27:25.219
Yeah. Listen, Chris,
over the years...

27:25.261 --> 27:26.728
you guys have whooped us
pretty good.

27:26.762 --> 27:28.787
How about taking it easy
on my guys this year?

27:28.831 --> 27:31.891
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

27:31.934 --> 27:33.561
MVP campers
are trained to compete...

27:33.603 --> 27:35.230
at the highest level
at all times.

27:35.271 --> 27:37.535
We wouldn't
want to confuse them.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.268
Looking good, Pat.

27:39.308 --> 27:41.105
All right,
let's work it around!

27:41.143 --> 27:42.405
Come on, men!

27:42.445 --> 27:44.174
Let's hit the field
and let the fates decide.

27:44.213 --> 27:45.646
There we go--
good plan, all right!

27:45.681 --> 27:47.410
There you go!
Eye of the tiger!

27:47.450 --> 27:48.917
Did you eat your
Wheaties today, Phillip?

27:48.951 --> 27:50.578
I hope to God
you ate your Wheaties.

27:50.620 --> 27:51.917
Simms, way to hustle.

27:51.954 --> 27:53.444
Like a rocket--
there you go.

27:54.790 --> 27:56.951
<i>Pat Finley, please report...</i>

27:56.993 --> 27:59.757
<i>to the men's toilet</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

27:59.795 --> 28:03.754
<i>Bring a mop</i>
<i>and a plunger...now!</i>

28:06.869 --> 28:09.565
<i>All right,</i>
<i>who's up first? Let's go!</i>

28:10.806 --> 28:12.774
Ohh, my arm!

28:13.776 --> 28:15.073
Oh, my knee!

28:15.111 --> 28:17.079
Ohh, my--

28:20.182 --> 28:24.915
<i># Even the best gets beat</i>
<i>sometimes, baby #</i>

28:24.954 --> 28:26.546
<i>Come on, lardo!</i>

28:26.589 --> 28:30.116
Tim, take me out, please!

28:30.159 --> 28:32.957
<i># You got to hang tough #</i>

28:32.995 --> 28:35.293
- Ohh!
- Out!

28:35.331 --> 28:36.821
<i># You got to hang tough #</i>

28:36.866 --> 28:39.426
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

28:39.468 --> 28:41.459
<i>Beautiful!</i>

28:41.504 --> 28:43.495
Can I go to the nurse?

28:43.539 --> 28:45.769
Yeah, OK, Phillip.

28:45.808 --> 28:49.471
Just wait till
someone comes back, OK?

28:51.681 --> 28:53.148
Ow, my arm.

28:54.383 --> 28:58.114
Cody, what on earth
is going on out there?

28:58.154 --> 29:00.452
We're Perkisizing.

29:04.493 --> 29:05.824
Strike!

29:05.861 --> 29:07.954
<i>Hey, batter, batter, batter.</i>

29:09.532 --> 29:11.864
<i># Even the experts miss</i>
<i>sometimes #</i>

29:11.901 --> 29:13.459
Strike!

29:13.502 --> 29:14.901
Strike three!

29:16.472 --> 29:17.700
Strike!

29:17.740 --> 29:20.402
Nice swing,
you fat towboat. Ha!

29:20.443 --> 29:22.434
Is that all you've got?

29:22.478 --> 29:23.638
Uhh!

29:25.014 --> 29:26.413
<i>That's foul!</i>

29:28.618 --> 29:31.018
Doh!

29:32.722 --> 29:35.714
<i>All right, next batter.</i>
<i>Let's go, son.</i>

29:38.027 --> 29:39.517
- Uhh!
- Look out!

29:39.562 --> 29:42.030
- Ow!
- Sorry!

29:42.064 --> 29:43.258
You can do it.

29:43.299 --> 29:44.823
Keep your eyes on the bat...

29:44.867 --> 29:46.630
put it in the pocket...

29:46.669 --> 29:47.829
swing harder...

29:47.870 --> 29:49.804
I have no idea
what I'm saying.

29:50.806 --> 29:52.000
Ohh!

29:52.041 --> 29:53.702
You OK?

29:55.444 --> 29:57.878
There goes your perfect game.
Come on!

29:57.913 --> 29:59.847
Calm down.

29:59.882 --> 30:01.679
Let's go!
Take your base, you big baby!

30:01.717 --> 30:02.877
You're holding up the game!

30:02.918 --> 30:05.910
<i># You got to hang tough #</i>

30:05.955 --> 30:08.446
<i>He ain't hurt.</i>
<i>Suck it up, Gerry!</i>

30:08.491 --> 30:11.051
Aww, look,
the poor baby's gonna cry.

30:11.093 --> 30:13.061
Don't blubber, chubber!
Ha ha.

30:13.095 --> 30:14.289
Uhh!

30:18.668 --> 30:20.602
Don't mess with us.

30:20.636 --> 30:23.169
<i>No, man, that's my bed!</i>

30:24.940 --> 30:27.602
I don't enjoy
this part of the job.

30:27.642 --> 30:33.205
But it's vital to the success
of the Perkis system...

30:34.649 --> 30:36.310
that we remove all temptation...

30:38.119 --> 30:39.313
<i>Ohh!</i>

30:39.354 --> 30:42.881
...from your lives. Here.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.721
<i>Dispose of that, Lars.</i>

30:46.595 --> 30:47.892
What?

30:47.929 --> 30:49.794
I'm still your friend.

30:49.831 --> 30:51.423
Come on, give me a hug.

30:51.466 --> 30:54.399
Hmm?

30:55.470 --> 30:56.732
Hmm.

30:56.771 --> 30:58.466
Come on.

31:03.912 --> 31:06.574
Tony believes in you.

31:11.253 --> 31:13.118
Looks like my man's packing.

31:21.830 --> 31:23.058
Drop back, son.

31:24.666 --> 31:27.794
<i>Oh, Tony.</i>

31:27.836 --> 31:30.236
Sir!
I was a Chipmunk last year.

31:30.272 --> 31:32.832
Look.

31:32.874 --> 31:34.034
Dawson,
what are you doing, man?

31:35.677 --> 31:38.339
Well, well, well,
what have we here?

31:38.380 --> 31:40.814
Who would like to own up
to this treasure trove?

31:40.849 --> 31:43.374
Whose wonderful candies
are these?

31:43.418 --> 31:45.943
Oh, look. A deli meat.

31:48.256 --> 31:49.848
You...come here.

31:49.891 --> 31:52.724
Yes, you. Come here.

31:52.761 --> 31:54.490
Don't be frightened.
Just come here.

31:54.529 --> 31:56.656
- I.D. cards.
- Yes, Tony.

31:56.698 --> 31:58.359
Let's see.

32:01.870 --> 32:07.433
"Garner, Gerald.
141 pounds. Age 11."

32:07.475 --> 32:10.876
You didn't have anything
to do with this, did you?

32:10.912 --> 32:13.472
Well...

32:13.515 --> 32:16.643
But I bet you might be able
to tell me who did?

32:18.787 --> 32:21.187
Anyone who brings candy
into this camp...

32:21.222 --> 32:22.814
is not your friend.

32:22.857 --> 32:25.951
He is a destroyer.

32:25.994 --> 32:29.896
Do you understand that,
Gerald Garner?

32:29.931 --> 32:32.263
Do you?

32:32.300 --> 32:36.236
I'm sure your father...

32:36.271 --> 32:38.762
Maury Garner,
wouldn't want to hear...

32:38.807 --> 32:42.299
that his son is a destroyer,
would he?

32:42.344 --> 32:43.572
I don't think so.

32:43.612 --> 32:46.103
Enough. All right.

32:46.147 --> 32:48.274
I'll tell you
whose candy it is.

32:48.316 --> 32:50.841
- Don't do it, Josh!
- Shh! Let the man speak.

32:50.885 --> 32:53.376
The candy belongs
to Seymour Butts.

32:53.421 --> 32:58.415
Seymour Butts?
Who's Seymour Butts?

32:58.460 --> 33:00.121
Who's Seymour Butts?!

33:00.161 --> 33:02.857
Nobody's seen more butts
than you, Uncle Tony!

33:08.737 --> 33:11.297
You picked the wrong man
to mess with.

33:11.339 --> 33:14.035
<i>Ooh.</i>

33:14.075 --> 33:16.168
I didn't know
I was messing with a man!

33:18.947 --> 33:22.542
Ha ha ha ha ha!
We have a comedian!

33:25.487 --> 33:27.387
Hey, I like comedians.

33:27.422 --> 33:30.323
Perhaps I can book you
on a tour.

33:30.358 --> 33:32.121
<i>You the man, Josh!</i>

33:43.004 --> 33:44.801
<i>Good morning, campers.</i>

33:44.839 --> 33:47.205
<i>Joshua Birnbaum</i>
<i>is no longer with us.</i>

33:47.242 --> 33:48.607
<i>His bed is now available.</i>

33:48.643 --> 33:51.111
Josh is all right,
isn't he?

33:51.146 --> 33:54.707
Man, I hope so...
wherever he is.

33:58.019 --> 33:59.850
Sam, did you hear about Josh?

33:59.888 --> 34:03.346
Sorry to hear about
your little friend Josh.

34:03.391 --> 34:05.791
Hey, Gerry. I found out
the truth about Josh.

34:05.827 --> 34:07.488
I heard that
they kicked him out...

34:07.529 --> 34:10.123
and his parents were so mad,
they wouldn't let him come home.

34:10.165 --> 34:13.293
They left him at a bus stop
all alone at midnight.

34:13.333 --> 34:16.393
Well, he's dead.

34:16.438 --> 34:17.632
He pulled a knife on Tony...

34:17.672 --> 34:20.469
and he's locked up in
a juvenile delinquent center.

34:20.507 --> 34:22.168
Now he's living
in the park in New York...

34:22.210 --> 34:24.235
with a guy who has no legs.

34:24.279 --> 34:25.438
No way.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.710
I'm just telling you
what I heard.

34:28.949 --> 34:30.850
<i>Dear Grandma...</i>

34:30.885 --> 34:34.821
<i>someone once said</i>
<i>"War is hell."</i>

34:34.856 --> 34:37.324
<i>They've never been</i>
<i>to fat camp.</i>

34:38.927 --> 34:41.054
<i>I knew</i>
<i>the food would be bad...</i>

34:41.096 --> 34:42.688
<i>but even worse...</i>

34:44.466 --> 34:47.161
<i>today he killed the Blob.</i>

34:47.202 --> 34:50.467
<i>As for the go-karts...</i>

34:50.505 --> 34:53.167
<i>may they rest in pieces.</i>

34:53.208 --> 34:54.572
<i>I'm writing you...</i>

34:54.609 --> 34:56.600
<i>because nobody else</i>
<i>seemed to care.</i>

34:56.643 --> 34:59.545
I did not send you
to go-kart camp.

35:01.716 --> 35:02.944
Attention, campers...

35:02.984 --> 35:06.750
lunch has been canceled today
due to lack of hustle.

35:06.788 --> 35:08.119
Deal with it.

35:08.156 --> 35:10.351
<i>Tony Perkis</i>
<i>tries to lead by example.</i>

35:10.391 --> 35:13.360
This is the eighteenth level
of the Perkis system.

35:13.394 --> 35:15.692
You'll all be doing this
by Labor Day!

35:15.730 --> 35:18.062
All right, do it to it, Lars!

35:18.099 --> 35:19.862
It's my honor, Tony!

35:21.236 --> 35:23.898
- Ohh!
- Crazy!

35:23.938 --> 35:26.634
<i>But we're afraid to follow.</i>

35:28.810 --> 35:32.871
I know each and every one of you
because I was you.

35:32.914 --> 35:36.782
<i>Once a day, the kids</i>
<i>from Camp MVP drive by...</i>

35:36.818 --> 35:38.149
<i>and make fun of us.</i>

35:38.186 --> 35:42.122
You stink! You stink!
You stink!

35:43.792 --> 35:45.692
Good one!

35:45.727 --> 35:50.027
<i>At night,</i>
<i>they vandalize our camp.</i>

35:57.839 --> 36:00.467
<i>At least Josh got out...</i>

36:00.508 --> 36:03.204
<i>where there's food.</i>

36:03.244 --> 36:06.475
<i>We have to resort</i>
<i>to more desperate measures.</i>

36:06.514 --> 36:08.607
Let's get 'em!

36:11.953 --> 36:13.147
I want meat!

36:13.188 --> 36:15.884
I'll save something for you!

36:15.924 --> 36:18.154
<i>Tony's arranged a dance</i>
<i>with the girls' camp...</i>

36:18.193 --> 36:22.220
<i>so he can humiliate us</i>
<i>into losing weight.</i>

36:22.263 --> 36:23.992
<i>Pray for me, Grandma.</i>

36:24.032 --> 36:25.522
<i>Love, Gerry.</i>

36:28.937 --> 36:32.202
<i># S-a-t-u-r-d-a-y</i>

36:32.240 --> 36:42.811
<i># S-a-t-u-r-d-a-y,</i>

36:42.851 --> 36:46.844
<i># Gonna keep on dancin'</i>

36:46.888 --> 36:48.412
<i># On Saturday night #</i>

<i># Saturday night #</i>

36:50.658 --> 36:53.354
<i># Dancin' to the rhythm</i>
<i>in our heart and soul #</i>

36:53.394 --> 36:56.022
<i># On Saturday night... #</i>

36:56.064 --> 36:58.294
Let's just get out of here.

36:58.333 --> 37:01.200
We can't, man.
They're guarding the door.

37:01.236 --> 37:03.830
<i># I--I--I--I got a date #</i>

37:03.872 --> 37:05.362
Rock 'n' roll.

37:05.406 --> 37:07.636
<i># At the good old</i>
<i>rock 'n' roll road show #</i>

37:07.675 --> 37:11.873
Sugar-free punch.
This bites.

37:11.913 --> 37:15.405
How much more
are they gonna subject us to?

37:15.450 --> 37:17.315
Why don't those guys
just lose weight?

37:17.352 --> 37:19.912
Why don't you show them
how to throw up after meals?

37:19.954 --> 37:21.751
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

37:21.789 --> 37:23.017
You guys, stop it.

37:25.860 --> 37:28.021
Team Jerkis strikes again, huh?

37:29.497 --> 37:32.193
Do you think he could've
possibly planned...

37:32.233 --> 37:34.224
for it to be this bad?

37:34.269 --> 37:35.896
<i>Yes.</i>

37:35.937 --> 37:38.405
I have some friends
in Child Welfare.

37:38.439 --> 37:42.034
Tony must be doing something
illegal around here.

37:42.076 --> 37:44.374
Maybe I should give them a call.

37:44.412 --> 37:47.939
- Great.
- This really bites!

37:47.982 --> 37:52.578
Would you like to have
some of this...punch?

37:52.620 --> 37:54.349
Yeah, thanks.

37:55.723 --> 37:58.089
<i># I believe in miracles #</i>

37:58.126 --> 38:00.424
Did you catch Lars's outfit?

38:00.461 --> 38:01.894
<i># Since you came along #</i>

38:01.930 --> 38:03.830
<i># You sexy thing #</i>

38:09.137 --> 38:11.002
Yo, check this out.

38:13.574 --> 38:15.269
Jeez, she's coming over!

38:15.310 --> 38:17.039
I think she's looking at me.

38:24.285 --> 38:26.947
Do you know
where the bathroom is?

38:35.196 --> 38:37.596
Ouch.

38:37.632 --> 38:39.827
That was brutal.

38:39.867 --> 38:41.926
They're young, you know?

38:41.970 --> 38:43.938
Still afraid of girls.

38:43.972 --> 38:45.496
Poor guys.

38:45.540 --> 38:48.532
So, do you want to dance?

38:48.576 --> 38:50.567
Um, uh...

38:50.611 --> 38:53.944
No, I have
a bad...sprained...

38:53.982 --> 38:56.075
Excuse me. Tim?

38:56.117 --> 38:57.345
<i># You sexy thing #</i>

38:57.385 --> 38:59.580
OK.

39:02.623 --> 39:04.557
This is really boring.

39:04.592 --> 39:08.289
This has got to end.

39:11.766 --> 39:14.326
<i># Oh-oh-oh, yeah #</i>

39:14.369 --> 39:16.837
Excuse me, guys.

39:16.871 --> 39:19.101
<i># I'm just a love machine #</i>

39:19.140 --> 39:22.200
<i># And I won't work</i>
<i>for nobody but you #</i>

39:22.243 --> 39:23.403
<i># Yeah, baby #</i>

39:23.444 --> 39:25.969
<i># I'm just a love machine #</i>

39:27.949 --> 39:29.746
Tim's blown a microchip!

39:32.687 --> 39:35.622
Tim! Tim!
What are you doing?

39:35.656 --> 39:37.385
Saving the dance. Come on.

39:37.425 --> 39:40.258
The girls will see
how much fun we're having...

39:40.294 --> 39:42.057
and then everyone will join in!

39:42.096 --> 39:43.324
That's weird, Tim.

39:43.364 --> 39:44.956
Maybe it is,
Reverend No-Fun...

39:44.999 --> 39:46.489
but I am saving the dance.

39:46.534 --> 39:49.560
Stand back and watch the magic!
Whoo!

39:49.604 --> 39:52.767
<i># I-I-I'm just</i>
<i>a love machine #</i>

39:52.807 --> 39:55.241
<i># And I won't work</i>
<i>for nobody but you #</i>

39:55.276 --> 39:56.971
<i># Ohh, yeah #</i>

39:58.246 --> 39:59.508
Yeah!

39:59.547 --> 40:01.606
Oh, yeah!
Get down to the funk!

40:03.317 --> 40:05.877
Don't you see how much fun
we're having?

40:05.920 --> 40:08.047
Join in!
It'll be contagious!

40:08.089 --> 40:09.613
It's called boogie fever!

40:09.657 --> 40:12.023
<i>- Whoo!</i>
<i>- That's it!</i>

40:12.060 --> 40:13.994
Nicholas, dance with me.

40:14.028 --> 40:16.223
Oh, yes!

40:16.264 --> 40:19.165
Shake a leg!
Let's go!

40:19.200 --> 40:22.761
<i># And I won't work</i>
<i>for nobody but you #</i>

40:22.804 --> 40:26.001
Maybe we should go out there.
It's just dancing.

40:26.040 --> 40:28.565
OK. I guess
I can stand this song.

40:28.609 --> 40:30.133
<i># Yeah, baby #</i>

40:30.178 --> 40:32.510
<i># A huggin' kissin' fiend #</i>

40:33.915 --> 40:35.109
Yes.

40:35.149 --> 40:36.741
Yes!

40:36.784 --> 40:38.877
Excuse me.

40:38.920 --> 40:41.150
May I have the pleasure
of this dance?

40:41.189 --> 40:43.123
Yes, you may.

40:43.157 --> 40:46.149
<i># That you have got to use #</i>

40:46.194 --> 40:49.493
<i># If you look into my file #</i>

40:49.530 --> 40:52.727
<i># I am sure</i>
<i>you can find out how #</i>

40:52.767 --> 40:56.259
<i># To turn me on,</i>
<i>just set my dial #</i>

40:56.304 --> 40:58.738
<i># And let me love you</i>
<i>for a little while #</i>

40:58.773 --> 41:02.709
<i># Ooh-ooh, I-I-I'm just</i>
<i>a love machine #</i>

41:02.743 --> 41:05.735
<i># And I won't work</i>
<i>for nobody but you #</i>

41:05.780 --> 41:07.077
<i># Ooh, yeah #</i>

41:07.115 --> 41:08.639
<i># I'm just a love machine #</i>

41:08.683 --> 41:10.446
<i># Yeah, baby #</i>

41:10.485 --> 41:12.715
<i># A huggin' kissin' fiend #</i>

41:12.753 --> 41:15.449
<i># La la-la-la-la #</i>

41:15.490 --> 41:17.185
<i># La-la-la-la #</i>

41:17.225 --> 41:18.419
<i># La-la #</i>

41:18.459 --> 41:19.858
<i># Ooh-ooh-ooh #</i>

41:19.894 --> 41:21.691
<i># La la-la-la-la #</i>

41:21.729 --> 41:23.094
<i># La-la-la-la #</i>

41:27.602 --> 41:30.002
All right, dance is over!

41:30.037 --> 41:31.902
Everybody go home!

41:31.939 --> 41:33.429
Thank you for coming,
ladies.

41:33.474 --> 41:34.736
<i>You ruin everything!</i>

41:34.775 --> 41:36.675
Buses are waiting
over there.

41:36.711 --> 41:39.373
Thank you.
I appreciate your efforts.

41:39.413 --> 41:41.472
I know this hasn't been easy.

41:46.621 --> 41:48.111
<i>He was nice, too.</i>

41:49.457 --> 41:52.017
Put the fruit trays away.

41:52.059 --> 41:54.391
The insects will be out soon.

42:12.480 --> 42:13.845
Hey.

42:13.881 --> 42:16.611
How about a ride out of here?

42:19.887 --> 42:22.822
Did this place
always stink this much?

42:24.692 --> 42:26.489
No, Gerry.

42:26.527 --> 42:29.792
This place used to stink
very little.

42:29.830 --> 42:32.799
In fact...

42:32.833 --> 42:34.698
it didn't stink at all.

42:34.735 --> 42:36.726
Well, it does now.

42:38.973 --> 42:44.707
I thought at least I'd be able
to ride the go-karts.

42:44.745 --> 42:47.236
I've never ridden one.

42:50.251 --> 42:51.684
You really like them?

42:53.521 --> 42:56.388
I'm so slow.

42:56.424 --> 42:58.688
It would've been cool
to go fast.

43:01.596 --> 43:04.531
Really fly, you know?

43:04.565 --> 43:07.398
I thought I'd be good at it.

43:10.104 --> 43:11.332
Really?

43:13.841 --> 43:15.172
That's interesting.

43:17.578 --> 43:21.344
Think you'd be able to handle
those hairpin turns?

43:21.382 --> 43:23.373
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

43:23.417 --> 43:25.749
Think you'd be able to handle
That powerful engine?

43:25.786 --> 43:27.686
Let's see what you got, Garner.
Come on!

43:27.722 --> 43:29.189
Whoo!

43:29.223 --> 43:31.350
Lean into it!
That's right!

43:35.596 --> 43:38.087
So, how did you learn
how to drive go-karts?

43:38.132 --> 43:39.622
Mowed a lot of lawns, Gerry!

43:39.667 --> 43:41.965
Avoid the obstacles!
Excellent! Sharp turn!

43:42.003 --> 43:43.402
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

43:46.540 --> 43:48.007
Come on, faster!

43:48.042 --> 43:50.704
Faster, faster, yeah.

43:50.745 --> 43:53.179
No problem.

43:53.214 --> 43:54.977
How are you
on your jumps, huh?

43:55.016 --> 43:57.951
- These things jump?
- They fly, buddy!

43:57.985 --> 43:59.850
Watch out for that oil slick!

43:59.887 --> 44:02.185
Aaah!

44:03.858 --> 44:06.520
Aah! Aaaah!

44:10.231 --> 44:12.699
That was fun.
Let's do it again.

44:14.235 --> 44:16.135
- OK.
- Yes!

44:16.170 --> 44:18.536
As soon as I catch my breath.

44:18.572 --> 44:20.039
Maybe next summer.

44:20.074 --> 44:22.065
Come on, Pat.

44:50.437 --> 44:52.428
Josh?

44:55.109 --> 44:57.942
Josh? It's Josh.

44:57.978 --> 44:59.343
<i>- Josh is back!</i>
<i>- Josh!</i>

44:59.380 --> 45:01.405
Josh!

45:01.448 --> 45:04.576
<i>- Man, good to see you!</i>
<i>- I knew you were OK!</i>

45:04.618 --> 45:07.746
Josh, what's wrong?
What'd they do to you?

45:07.788 --> 45:10.689
Josh...speak to me.

45:10.724 --> 45:13.625
Were you in jail?
The nut house?

45:13.661 --> 45:16.357
Josh, it's me--Gerry.

45:16.397 --> 45:20.561
Gerry. Pbbbbt.

45:20.601 --> 45:22.865
Heh heh. Funny, Josh.

45:22.903 --> 45:24.632
What happened, man?
Talk to us.

45:26.874 --> 45:29.741
Josh was bad.

45:30.778 --> 45:32.109
<i>What's he mean?</i>

45:32.146 --> 45:35.343
Oh, man. Oh, jeez.

45:38.352 --> 45:41.048
Josh now good.

45:41.088 --> 45:44.319
Good? What do you mean?

45:44.358 --> 45:48.055
Must be...
good to see my big ass again!

45:50.331 --> 45:52.561
I liked you better
with the lobotomy.

45:52.600 --> 45:54.158
What really happened, man?

45:54.201 --> 45:55.896
Perkis sent me home
without a refund.

45:55.936 --> 45:57.904
However, my dad's a lawyer.

45:58.005 --> 46:00.303
He threatened to sue
and Perkis caved...

46:00.341 --> 46:02.707
like the Buffalo Bills
in the Super Bowl.

46:09.750 --> 46:12.878
Hey, Josh, how long
have you been shaving?

46:12.920 --> 46:14.251
A couple of years.

46:16.090 --> 46:18.354
What was it like on the outside?

46:19.593 --> 46:24.326
It was incredible.
First, I went to the Sizzler!

46:24.365 --> 46:27.266
Got that all-you-can-eat meal.
I closed the place.

46:27.301 --> 46:29.599
How are we fixed
for supplies on this end?

46:29.637 --> 46:31.264
Perkis wiped us out.

46:31.305 --> 46:34.240
There isn't a Gummi Bear
left in this entire camp.

46:36.777 --> 46:39.803
Whew. I am doggin' it
this morning.

46:41.915 --> 46:44.679
Ahh. Come on, T.

46:44.718 --> 46:47.209
Now let's do it up.

46:47.254 --> 46:48.516
Whew!

46:50.457 --> 46:52.448
<i>Start me up.</i>

46:54.795 --> 46:56.194
Come on.

46:56.230 --> 46:58.630
Hurry up, guys.
We don't have all day.

46:58.666 --> 47:01.066
Lift those legs.

47:02.169 --> 47:04.103
Looks pretty sturdy, guys.

47:07.341 --> 47:10.174
- Hurry up, man.
- I'm trying.

47:11.345 --> 47:14.610
Roy, you're up first.
Give it a shot.

47:14.648 --> 47:16.639
Simms,
you're my lookout man.

47:16.684 --> 47:19.653
Give me a boost. Up, up.

47:19.687 --> 47:20.881
Uhh!

47:22.423 --> 47:23.583
<i>Aah!</i>

47:33.367 --> 47:35.062
All right.
Gerry, check this room out.

47:35.102 --> 47:36.626
Roy, Nicholas,
you guys come with me...

47:36.670 --> 47:37.898
and be quiet about it.

47:37.938 --> 47:40.236
That candy's gotta be
in here somewhere.

47:40.274 --> 47:43.334
<i>I'll find the candy.</i>

47:43.377 --> 47:45.470
Where's the sweets?

47:48.115 --> 47:50.447
- Over here.
- What do you got?

47:56.090 --> 47:58.718
Come on, you devil log!

47:58.759 --> 48:00.750
Uhh!

48:04.298 --> 48:05.458
Oh!

48:05.499 --> 48:07.262
- Hurry up.
- All right, all right.

48:10.170 --> 48:11.831
"Perkisize with Tony"?

48:11.872 --> 48:13.772
That's me!

48:15.042 --> 48:16.532
I'm skinny.

48:19.913 --> 48:22.211
- Come on, Josh!
- I'm trying!

48:22.249 --> 48:23.716
If you can't get it,
we need to leave.

48:25.219 --> 48:26.379
Yeah!

48:28.489 --> 48:30.855
Uhh!

48:32.860 --> 48:34.623
Thanks, Captain.

48:36.730 --> 48:39.198
I'm doggin' it, Pat!

48:41.802 --> 48:43.133
<i>Letters?</i>

48:47.307 --> 48:49.571
You guys,
these are our letters home.

48:49.610 --> 48:53.944
No way. This guy is sick!

48:53.981 --> 48:56.347
This is the letter
I wrote my grandma!

49:06.860 --> 49:08.054
Oh!

49:13.200 --> 49:15.998
Pack it up, guys.
Let's move!

49:16.036 --> 49:18.368
Oh, no. We're dead!

49:24.478 --> 49:27.038
He's coming! He's coming!

49:27.080 --> 49:29.014
He's coming!

49:32.186 --> 49:33.551
Roy, the picture!

49:33.587 --> 49:35.418
Josh, the drawers!

49:41.295 --> 49:42.990
Put the whites away, Gerry.
Help me!

49:43.030 --> 49:46.193
- Whites right here.
- Just throw it in!

49:46.233 --> 49:49.259
Oooooo-ahhhh!

49:50.904 --> 49:53.532
Wait a sec!
Where's Nicholas?

49:56.643 --> 49:58.611
You guys go. I'll get him.

49:58.645 --> 50:00.306
Let's move it, Roy.

50:00.347 --> 50:02.872
Nickie! Nicholas!

50:05.919 --> 50:07.682
Mmm!

50:07.721 --> 50:10.155
What are you doing?
He's coming!

50:14.261 --> 50:15.489
Get down.

50:17.364 --> 50:18.626
Gerry, come on!

50:29.376 --> 50:33.005
- Oh, my. I didn't mean to.
- Just go!

50:34.515 --> 50:35.777
Uhh!

50:47.261 --> 50:48.455
Oh!

50:53.033 --> 50:55.331
Uhh!

50:58.639 --> 51:00.300
Scatter!

51:31.738 --> 51:32.898
Coast clear?

51:32.940 --> 51:34.430
- That was close.
- Clear!

51:34.474 --> 51:36.999
- Whoo!
- We did it.

51:37.044 --> 51:40.013
You really showed
some guts out there, Cappy.

51:40.047 --> 51:42.572
One of those fish and chips
farts there, Nickie?

51:42.616 --> 51:44.140
I extend my deepest apologies--

51:44.184 --> 51:47.312
Wait! Wrapper.

51:47.354 --> 51:50.482
- What?
- Food wrapper.

51:50.524 --> 51:51.855
Come on!

51:54.695 --> 51:56.890
Who's in there?
What have you got?

51:56.930 --> 52:00.127
Nothing! No one!
Just go away!

52:04.037 --> 52:06.005
Where'd you get that?!

52:06.039 --> 52:07.233
I found it?

52:07.274 --> 52:09.367
You found it.
Come here, you little punk!

52:09.409 --> 52:11.377
- Tell us!
- Yeah, tell us!

52:11.411 --> 52:13.436
All right!
OK! I'll tell you!

52:13.480 --> 52:16.210
You gotta keep it a secret.

52:20.253 --> 52:23.188
<i># I know a guy</i>
<i>who's tough but sweet #</i>

52:24.791 --> 52:27.624

<i>he can't be beat #</i>

<i># He's got everything</i>

<i>Here we go.</i>

53:07.668 --> 53:09.602
Hey, I'm not rolling yet.

53:13.306 --> 53:15.274
Are you rolling now, Kenneth?

53:15.308 --> 53:17.776
- Speed.
- Does that mean rolling?

53:17.811 --> 53:19.836
Yes, it does.

53:21.081 --> 53:22.844
<i>OK, everyone.</i>
<i>Clap your hands!</i>

53:27.521 --> 53:30.888
We've reached the midpoint
of our great experiment.

53:30.924 --> 53:32.983
Parents' Day
is just around the corner...

53:33.026 --> 53:35.392
and I think they're gonna be
very, very pleased.

53:35.429 --> 53:36.919
Remember to wear
your name tags.

53:36.963 --> 53:40.490
I don't think
they'll recognize you.

53:40.534 --> 53:41.933
Now it's time to see...

53:41.968 --> 53:44.732
what the Perkis system means
in pure loss of poundage.

53:44.771 --> 53:47.763
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

53:47.808 --> 53:50.208
Phillip Rubinoff,
step up, son.

53:51.878 --> 53:54.142
All right,
let's see how you're doing...

53:54.181 --> 53:56.115
you little whippersnapper.

53:59.319 --> 54:03.085
You're two pounds heavier
than when you came to camp...

54:03.123 --> 54:04.613
but we can fix that.
All we have to do...

54:04.658 --> 54:06.216
is decrease his food intake...

54:06.259 --> 54:08.420
and increase
his metabolic output.

54:08.462 --> 54:10.453
All right!
Step off the scale, son.

54:10.497 --> 54:13.125
Muscle weighs more than fat!

54:13.166 --> 54:15.794
<i>All right! OK!</i>

54:15.836 --> 54:19.932
Gerald Garner.
Step on up, Gerald.

54:21.341 --> 54:24.276
- Good luck.
- Go get 'em, Captain.

54:25.445 --> 54:28.278
Hello, Gerald.
Moment of truth.

54:31.518 --> 54:32.917
Hmm?

54:40.360 --> 54:42.988
You've gained nine pounds.

54:43.029 --> 54:45.520
Have you been cheating?

54:45.565 --> 54:47.294
Turn off the camera.

54:47.334 --> 54:49.302
Let me make something
very clear.

54:49.336 --> 54:51.531
The Perkis system
does not work...

54:51.571 --> 54:55.337
with cheaters
like Gerald Garner, OK?

54:55.375 --> 54:58.776
How can I sell an infomercial
about fat kids...

54:58.879 --> 55:02.371
who can't keep their
piggy little snouts shut?

55:02.415 --> 55:05.213
Who's gonna buy that?
Step off the scale.

55:08.622 --> 55:11.887
OK. Turn on the camera.

55:11.925 --> 55:14.587
Josh Birnbaum, step on up!

55:14.628 --> 55:16.892
Get on the scale, son!
All right!

55:18.765 --> 55:19.925
- Get off the scale.
- OK, then.

55:19.966 --> 55:22.958
Turn off the camera.
All right.

55:23.003 --> 55:25.995
All right, fine.
I blame myself.

55:27.140 --> 55:28.368
You know what?

55:28.408 --> 55:31.502
I don't blame myself.
No, not this time, Tony.

55:31.545 --> 55:33.536
Excuse me one second.

55:38.385 --> 55:40.353
How you doin', little Tony?

55:40.387 --> 55:41.684
Bad.

55:41.721 --> 55:43.279
Why do you feel bad?

55:43.323 --> 55:45.052
Because everything's
falling apart...

55:45.091 --> 55:46.786
and I can't do anything
about it.

55:46.827 --> 55:49.261
It's not your fault.

55:49.296 --> 55:51.230
I know it's not my fault,
but whose fault is it...

55:51.264 --> 55:52.526
if it's not my fault?

55:52.566 --> 55:54.864
It's their fault.
That's right.

55:54.901 --> 55:56.459
It's their fault!

55:56.503 --> 55:59.131
You have failed,
and you will pay!

55:59.172 --> 56:00.833
Tomorrow morning at 0600...

56:00.874 --> 56:02.967
everyone who has not met
their weight loss goal...

56:03.009 --> 56:04.738
will join me
on a 20-mile hike.

56:04.778 --> 56:07.941
Pack light, boys.
The party's over.

56:07.981 --> 56:10.950
Twenty miles? Tony!

56:10.984 --> 56:13.452
Tony, sir,
with all due respect...

56:13.486 --> 56:15.784
I don't think it's healthy
to subject the--

56:15.822 --> 56:17.517
Healthy? Oh, healthy!

56:17.557 --> 56:20.651
The fat man is gonna tell me
what's healthy!

56:20.694 --> 56:22.753
I'm just saying that--

56:22.796 --> 56:24.354
You just--You--I--

56:24.397 --> 56:26.388
I think if--
To subject the kids--

56:26.433 --> 56:27.764
Know what? It's funny.

56:27.801 --> 56:31.464
Nobody really cares
what you have to say.

56:31.504 --> 56:33.631
You're a negativity-spreader.

56:33.673 --> 56:36.164
You're contaminating my well,
Finley...

56:36.209 --> 56:38.473
and I won't have it.

56:40.513 --> 56:42.845
Let's make the best
of this afternoon.

56:47.854 --> 56:49.344
<i>It's OK, man.</i>

56:49.389 --> 56:51.357
<i>Forget it, Pat.</i>

57:10.042 --> 57:12.272
Hey.

57:14.680 --> 57:18.013
They're having a barbecue
over at Camp MVP tonight.

57:18.050 --> 57:19.984
Carolina ribs.

57:20.019 --> 57:23.682
The pork, not the beef.

57:23.722 --> 57:26.748
I wonder what it would feel like
to be one of those guys.

57:26.792 --> 57:30.751
Just once I want to score
a winning touchdown.

57:30.796 --> 57:31.990
In my entire life...

57:32.031 --> 57:34.864
I've never scored a point
in anything.

57:37.903 --> 57:39.530
Gerry.

57:42.108 --> 57:44.576
I'm just so tired
of being the fat guy.

57:45.978 --> 57:48.208
I know, Pat...

57:48.247 --> 57:50.909
but you don't want to be
one of those guys.

57:50.950 --> 57:53.976
They're jerks.

57:55.754 --> 57:56.982
Forget them.

57:57.022 --> 57:58.853
Yeah, forget them.

57:58.891 --> 58:00.916
Yeah.

58:00.960 --> 58:02.825
Forget you!

58:02.862 --> 58:05.854
Keep your washboard stomachs
and your oily muscles!

58:05.898 --> 58:07.923
I don't want them!

58:10.970 --> 58:13.029
I'm still tired
of being the fat guy.

58:13.072 --> 58:14.630
Come on, Pat.
You're cool.

58:14.673 --> 58:16.106
Everybody knows that.

58:16.142 --> 58:18.633
I feel cool.

58:18.677 --> 58:22.238
Being humiliated by that psycho
today was pretty cool.

58:22.281 --> 58:23.942
Oh, yeah.

58:23.983 --> 58:26.281
I've been
a lot of help to you guys.

58:28.120 --> 58:31.055
At least you stood up to him.

58:34.827 --> 58:36.761
Nobody else had the guts to.

58:38.430 --> 58:40.227
We should've backed you up.

58:41.934 --> 58:45.734
When are we going to start
sticking up for ourselves?

58:49.141 --> 58:53.271
Now, Gerry.
How about right now?

58:53.312 --> 58:56.713
Yeah. Let's go get everybody
and kick his ass!

58:56.749 --> 58:59.411
Yeah! Hold it. Whoa, whoa.

58:59.451 --> 59:01.078
We got to be smart here.

59:01.120 --> 59:02.781
There's some proper channels
to go through...

59:02.821 --> 59:05.551
but you get those guys
through the hike tomorrow.

59:05.591 --> 59:07.286
I'll do everything
I can back here.

59:07.326 --> 59:08.884
You be the leader now, Captain.

59:08.928 --> 59:11.624
He is one, we are many.

59:11.664 --> 59:12.926
His days are numbered.

59:12.965 --> 59:15.729
- He's not so tough.
- Yeah!

59:18.904 --> 59:22.237
This is the day we separate
the men from the boys.

59:24.210 --> 59:27.111
Hightail it back to camp, Lars.
It'll be a rough one.

59:27.146 --> 59:30.638
I don't want to see any slackers
or hear any whiners.

59:30.683 --> 59:33.914
There'll be no food.
This is a cleansing hike.

59:33.953 --> 59:37.753
Just Father Sky, Mother Earth...

59:37.790 --> 59:39.815
and your dear old Uncle Tony.

59:48.567 --> 59:52.264
Use the swatting motion
as an isometric exercise.

59:53.739 --> 59:56.674
My dogs are killing me.

59:56.709 --> 59:59.200
Gosh, somebody
going to die today.

59:59.245 --> 01:00:00.610
Call 911.

01:00:00.646 --> 01:00:02.944
Did you ever hear
the story of Icarus...

01:00:02.982 --> 01:00:06.110
who continually rolled
the ball up the hill?

01:00:06.151 --> 01:00:08.085
But when he got too close...

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.385
the ball melted
in the heat of the sun.

01:00:11.423 --> 01:00:13.755
You're all like Icarus.

01:00:17.896 --> 01:00:20.387
Aah! Aah!

01:00:27.806 --> 01:00:29.000
- Whoa!
- Aah!

01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:31.009
Thank you, Gerry.

01:00:43.322 --> 01:00:45.722
Uhh!

01:00:46.959 --> 01:00:49.189
Get up, Cody.

01:00:49.228 --> 01:00:51.924
Leave him.
He's a straggler.

01:00:51.964 --> 01:00:55.491
Stragglers must be left
to fend for themselves.

01:00:55.534 --> 01:00:57.024
I was.

01:00:57.069 --> 01:00:58.969
Get up, Cody.
We need to go.

01:01:01.273 --> 01:01:03.002
Did you talk to Child Welfare?

01:01:03.042 --> 01:01:05.875
They'd be glad to
come out and investigate...

01:01:05.911 --> 01:01:08.345
but they can't come
for two weeks.

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.110
That's too long.
What did your lawyer buddy say?

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:13.914
It's dicey. We don't
have any hard evidence.

01:01:13.952 --> 01:01:16.386
Tony's the hard evidence.
Just look at him.

01:01:16.422 --> 01:01:18.185
That's what the lawyer said.

01:01:18.223 --> 01:01:22.159
- So we have nothing.
- Basically.

01:01:22.194 --> 01:01:25.789
You guys seen Tony?

01:01:25.831 --> 01:01:30.097
That moron owes me 600 bucks.
I'll kill that guy.

01:01:30.135 --> 01:01:33.002
<i>Busting my ass</i>
<i>around here for nothing.</i>

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.514
Feel the chi.

01:01:52.124 --> 01:01:54.524
Repulse the monkey.

01:01:59.498 --> 01:02:04.902
<i>Part the wild horse's mane.</i>

01:02:04.937 --> 01:02:06.131
I say we push him.

01:02:06.171 --> 01:02:08.969
No jury in the world
could convict us.

01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:11.742
<i>Strike the chi.</i>

01:02:11.777 --> 01:02:15.907
No. Too messy.
We can do better.

01:02:22.388 --> 01:02:23.821
Great.

01:02:23.856 --> 01:02:26.848
You've all done
much better than expected...

01:02:26.892 --> 01:02:28.985
so I've got
a little surprise for you.

01:02:29.027 --> 01:02:31.359
I've decided to extend
the hike indefinitely.

01:02:31.397 --> 01:02:33.024
- What?
- That's right.

01:02:33.065 --> 01:02:34.259
You won't return to camp...

01:02:34.299 --> 01:02:35.823
Until you're
in the leanest, meanest...

01:02:35.868 --> 01:02:38.359
bestest shape
of your short lives...

01:02:38.404 --> 01:02:40.167
with one goal in mind--

01:02:40.205 --> 01:02:44.471
to defeat Camp MVP
in the Apache Relay.

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:46.774
Quite the ending to
a late-night infomercial, hmm?

01:02:46.812 --> 01:02:49.645
We don't want to play MVP.
We want to have fun.

01:02:49.681 --> 01:02:51.842
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:02:51.884 --> 01:02:54.148
Cody wants to have fun.

01:02:54.186 --> 01:02:57.178
All right, Cody,
let's have some fun.

01:03:00.592 --> 01:03:02.389
Whee-ha!

01:03:02.428 --> 01:03:04.259
- Oh, my--
- Whoa!

01:03:04.296 --> 01:03:06.890
I'm on the top of the world!

01:03:06.932 --> 01:03:11.869
Yeah!
How's this for fun, Cody?

01:03:11.904 --> 01:03:15.032
Sam? Why don't you
come out and join me?

01:03:15.073 --> 01:03:17.166
I'm on my way.

01:03:17.209 --> 01:03:18.870
He's going to get us killed.

01:03:18.911 --> 01:03:21.573
- We got to do something.
- Yeah, but what?

01:03:21.613 --> 01:03:23.513
What's that? I missed it.

01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:29.385
I was just saying
we need a little rest.

01:03:29.421 --> 01:03:30.911
Good idea.

01:03:30.956 --> 01:03:32.856
Let's take an hour
meditation break.

01:03:32.891 --> 01:03:34.825
Then we're going to climb
that 1,000-foot rock face...

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:37.488
over there with
our bare hands and feet.

01:03:37.529 --> 01:03:39.497
I know you can do it.

01:03:39.531 --> 01:03:42.989
Until then, observe
the silence of the chi.

01:03:46.939 --> 01:03:49.373
- Shoot.
- Let's do something.

01:03:49.408 --> 01:03:51.035
I don't know.

01:03:51.076 --> 01:03:53.772
Ohmmmm...

01:03:55.347 --> 01:03:57.838
<i>- You're lying.</i>
<i>- I don't believe in you.</i>

01:03:57.883 --> 01:04:01.882
<i>You can't do it!</i>

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.753
Hahh! Cripes.

01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:08.419
What is all the commotion?

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:12.624
We realize we've been lazy,
and we want to change.

01:04:12.664 --> 01:04:15.633
It's time we all got
our acts together, buddy.

01:04:15.667 --> 01:04:18.101
Good! Good!

01:04:18.136 --> 01:04:20.036
It's amazing what
a little food deprivation...

01:04:20.072 --> 01:04:21.869
can do to adjust
your attitude, huh?

01:04:21.907 --> 01:04:23.101
Can I ask you a question?

01:04:23.141 --> 01:04:25.632
Go ahead, Roy. Ask away.

01:04:25.677 --> 01:04:28.544
Is it possible to do a sit-up
if you can't see or hear?

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:31.413
Yes, Roy, it is possible.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:34.613
Gerry says it's impossible.

01:04:34.653 --> 01:04:37.383
Why don't we rock Gerry's world?

01:04:37.422 --> 01:04:39.686
Come on.

01:04:39.725 --> 01:04:42.455
Uncle Tony's going
to do a little demo.

01:04:44.162 --> 01:04:46.858
There are so many myths
about the abdominal muscles.

01:04:46.899 --> 01:04:48.992
I am happy to put
this one to rest.

01:04:49.034 --> 01:04:52.060
See, Gerry? I told you.

01:04:52.104 --> 01:04:54.334
Now, remember, Uncle Tony...

01:04:54.373 --> 01:04:55.772
don't get up till
the count of three.

01:04:55.807 --> 01:04:59.402
- I know the rules.
- OK, good.

01:04:59.444 --> 01:05:00.911
All right, everyone.
Ready?

01:05:00.946 --> 01:05:04.074
One, two, three!

01:05:04.116 --> 01:05:05.447
Kiss my butt!

01:05:05.484 --> 01:05:09.818
Oh, my! Oh, my! Haah!

01:05:09.855 --> 01:05:11.345
Uhh! Uhh!

01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:13.324
Pretty impressive stuff,
huh, Tony?

01:05:13.358 --> 01:05:14.985
You disgust me.

01:05:15.027 --> 01:05:16.688
Come here!

01:05:16.728 --> 01:05:19.219
Come here!
Get out of my way!

01:05:19.264 --> 01:05:20.424
What are we waiting for?

01:05:20.465 --> 01:05:21.864
Come on!

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.595
<i>Run, Josh!</i>

01:05:26.138 --> 01:05:28.265
Halt!

01:05:28.307 --> 01:05:30.969
Run! Run! Go!

01:05:31.009 --> 01:05:34.035
Ow! Ooh! Hamstring!

01:05:34.079 --> 01:05:36.377
Well, congratulations.

01:05:36.415 --> 01:05:38.349
You've just joined
the 76% of Americans...

01:05:38.383 --> 01:05:40.317
who forget to stretch
before physical activity.

01:05:40.352 --> 01:05:42.343
Aah!

01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:48.951
<i>Let me see.</i>

01:05:48.994 --> 01:05:51.019
<i>Ohh...</i>

01:05:51.063 --> 01:05:54.624
Uhh. Uhh.

01:05:54.666 --> 01:05:56.691
Gentlemen...

01:05:56.735 --> 01:06:01.229
we've reached
the point of no return.

01:06:01.273 --> 01:06:02.831
Yeah!

01:06:07.678 --> 01:06:09.839
The only problem is,
Kenny wants a lot of money.

01:06:09.881 --> 01:06:11.143
How much?

01:06:11.182 --> 01:06:13.173
Much more than
they pay camp counselors.

01:06:13.217 --> 01:06:14.650
Great. Why don't
we have a bake sale?

01:06:14.685 --> 01:06:16.949
What are you doing back
already?

01:06:16.988 --> 01:06:19.149
Where's the other guys?
You OK?

01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:20.521
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:06:20.558 --> 01:06:24.358
Good. We're still working on
a plan to get rid of Tony.

01:06:24.395 --> 01:06:25.589
Wait till
you hear what we got.

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:26.824
That's great, guys...

01:06:26.864 --> 01:06:29.264
but we came up
with a plan of our own.

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.598
That is so cute.

01:06:31.636 --> 01:06:34.696
Whatever. Come with me.

01:06:41.479 --> 01:06:43.640
I have got a bad feeling.

01:06:43.681 --> 01:06:46.479
Just try to stay open-minded.

01:06:50.154 --> 01:06:53.419
- Password, please?
- Yankee doodles.

01:06:58.029 --> 01:06:59.792
Oh, good God.

01:06:59.831 --> 01:07:02.356
Ooh! Uhh!

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.027
This is unbelievable.

01:07:04.068 --> 01:07:05.933
So, what was your plan?

01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:07.995
What do you think
you're doing?

01:07:08.039 --> 01:07:09.631
Taking over the camp.

01:07:09.674 --> 01:07:12.370
<i>- Oh, good God!</i>
<i>- This is insane!</i>

01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:13.775
This is great.

01:07:13.811 --> 01:07:15.779
Pat, you know what?
He snapped.

01:07:15.813 --> 01:07:17.440
He was swinging
from a branch.

01:07:17.482 --> 01:07:20.178
He was going to make us
climb a mountain.

01:07:20.218 --> 01:07:22.015
Guys, you can't kidnap
the owner of a camp.

01:07:22.053 --> 01:07:24.214
They give people
the chair for this.

01:07:24.255 --> 01:07:26.120
It was self-defense.
You got to believe us.

01:07:26.157 --> 01:07:27.749
I believe you.

01:07:27.792 --> 01:07:30.260
This ends right now.

01:07:30.294 --> 01:07:32.762
Get out of my way, Simms.

01:07:32.797 --> 01:07:35.027
Yankee doodles.

01:07:36.767 --> 01:07:39.827
Tony, I'm so sorry.
I'll untie you right away.

01:07:39.871 --> 01:07:42.738
Uhh! Thank you.

01:07:42.773 --> 01:07:46.140
When this is all over,
I'm going to deliver...

01:07:46.177 --> 01:07:47.667
one well-placed kick
to your groin...

01:07:47.712 --> 01:07:49.304
that'll stop you from
ever having children...

01:07:49.347 --> 01:07:50.678
you worthless piece of--

01:07:50.715 --> 01:07:54.617
Are these ropes tight enough?
We can get more.

01:07:54.652 --> 01:07:58.418
I was going to help you out,
but now...

01:07:58.456 --> 01:08:00.253
I have to take you down.

01:08:00.291 --> 01:08:02.282
- All right!
- Yeah! Go!

01:08:02.326 --> 01:08:05.420
I always wanted
to say that to somebody.

01:08:05.463 --> 01:08:08.227
Guys, it looks like
we have to play this out.

01:08:08.266 --> 01:08:10.826
I think there might be
a way out of this...

01:08:10.868 --> 01:08:12.130
but if we're going
to succeed...

01:08:12.169 --> 01:08:14.899
we have to stick together
and work as a team.

01:08:14.939 --> 01:08:16.600
<i>Uhh!</i>

01:08:18.542 --> 01:08:20.374
I'll see you all in hell!

01:08:20.411 --> 01:08:22.207
Oh!

01:08:22.246 --> 01:08:24.475
With all the bears
in these woods, Lars...

01:08:24.515 --> 01:08:27.973
I doubt that you'll be
seeing much of anything.

01:08:28.019 --> 01:08:32.011
- Bears love honey.
- Honey?

01:08:32.055 --> 01:08:34.524
Chipmunks, move out.

01:08:34.559 --> 01:08:37.823
Lars, have a nice summer.

01:08:37.862 --> 01:08:41.229
- I didn't mean it.
- Heh heh heh!

01:08:41.265 --> 01:08:42.788
I'm sorry. I...

01:08:42.832 --> 01:08:44.960
Ow!

01:08:45.002 --> 01:08:46.970
Aah! I hate you!

01:08:47.004 --> 01:08:49.096
You're awful!

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:51.267
Please help me!

01:08:51.309 --> 01:08:52.867
I have candy.

01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:55.174
Candy.

01:08:55.212 --> 01:08:58.443
Good boy.
You've come to free me.

01:08:58.482 --> 01:09:00.006
Ohh!

01:09:03.254 --> 01:09:04.618
Think we're going
a little too far here, guys?

01:09:04.654 --> 01:09:08.182
No, man. There are no bears
in these woods.

01:09:08.225 --> 01:09:12.093
<i>Aah! Aah!</i>

01:09:12.129 --> 01:09:14.426
No bears, huh?

01:09:14.465 --> 01:09:17.491
<i>Aah!</i>

01:09:20.938 --> 01:09:22.496
Help me!

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:26.067
Don't you have any decency?
Help me!

01:09:30.381 --> 01:09:31.779
Look at the little deer.

01:09:31.816 --> 01:09:35.411
Mr. Deer,
I am a vegetarian.

01:10:02.079 --> 01:10:05.947
Yeah!

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:11.187
<i>Wake up, Tony.</i>

01:10:11.222 --> 01:10:13.281
<i>Tonight is Evaluation Night.</i>

01:10:13.324 --> 01:10:15.417
<i>The key word here is "value."</i>

01:10:15.459 --> 01:10:17.120
<i>Do you have any?</i>

01:10:17.161 --> 01:10:19.459
<i>No way,</i>
<i>because you're a loser</i>--

01:10:19.497 --> 01:10:21.692
<i>a loser</i>
<i>with a skinny wiener.</i>

01:10:21.732 --> 01:10:24.963
<i>So, relax...</i>
<i>and repeat after me.</i>

01:10:25.002 --> 01:10:26.799
<i>I am a loser.</i>

01:10:26.837 --> 01:10:28.566
<i>I smell.</i>

01:10:28.606 --> 01:10:31.006
<i>I have no friends.</i>

01:10:31.042 --> 01:10:32.236
<i>Now breathe and relax.</i>

01:10:32.276 --> 01:10:35.712
Please, shut that off!

01:10:38.916 --> 01:10:40.349
Ohh!

01:10:40.384 --> 01:10:42.909
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

01:10:42.953 --> 01:10:45.012
Wow!

01:10:57.501 --> 01:10:58.695
All right!

01:11:05.142 --> 01:11:07.167
Thank you very much
for stopping on by.

01:11:07.211 --> 01:11:09.702
Pass it on by.
I'll take one of those.

01:11:09.747 --> 01:11:12.215
Party! Yeah!

01:11:12.249 --> 01:11:16.117
Oh, my gosh. Is that Tim?

01:11:16.153 --> 01:11:17.984
Whoo-hoo!

01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:22.620
He looks like a human s'more.

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:26.653
Look at that food.
I should get down there.

01:11:26.697 --> 01:11:28.995
No, Pat, don't go.

01:11:31.869 --> 01:11:34.235
Stay here with me.

01:11:35.272 --> 01:11:38.730
- Aah!
- Shut up.

01:11:38.776 --> 01:11:41.574
Hey, Lars, guess what?
We're in charge now.

01:11:41.612 --> 01:11:43.045
Know what we found out?

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.641
If you don't have a job,
you get deported...

01:11:46.684 --> 01:11:49.346
so, Lars, buddy, pal...

01:11:49.386 --> 01:11:52.287
you with us,
or are you against us?

01:11:52.323 --> 01:11:55.520
I am with you.

01:11:55.559 --> 01:11:57.459
I love you.

01:12:02.633 --> 01:12:04.863
I thought they were
supposed to be on diets.

01:12:04.902 --> 01:12:06.062
I think they're cheating.

01:12:37.768 --> 01:12:41.761
Good God!
Can anybody hear me?

01:13:11.735 --> 01:13:14.727
Excuse me.

01:13:30.554 --> 01:13:33.455
Time to wake up, children.

01:13:33.490 --> 01:13:34.855
Good morning!

01:13:34.892 --> 01:13:37.656
Huh? Huh?

01:13:40.731 --> 01:13:43.359
Who wants to tell us
the lesson we learned here?

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.960
Don't put Twinkies
on your pizza.

01:13:46.003 --> 01:13:48.801
No. I think
what we learned here...

01:13:48.839 --> 01:13:52.331
is something about
personal responsibility.

01:13:52.376 --> 01:13:54.367
From now on, each of us...

01:13:54.411 --> 01:13:56.845
is in charge of
their own diets.

01:13:56.881 --> 01:13:59.111
We have to learn
some self-control.

01:13:59.149 --> 01:14:02.312
Isn't that right, Tim?

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:06.387
You got it.
I'm ashamed of all of you.

01:14:06.423 --> 01:14:08.015
Come on!

01:14:08.058 --> 01:14:10.618
We got to get healthy
for ourselves.

01:14:10.661 --> 01:14:12.629
If we'd start
respecting ourselves...

01:14:12.663 --> 01:14:14.324
no one can touch us.

01:14:14.365 --> 01:14:17.027
That's right.
You heard me.

01:14:17.067 --> 01:14:18.500
We're as good as anybody...

01:14:18.535 --> 01:14:21.060
and it's about time
we started acting that way.

01:14:21.105 --> 01:14:22.265
We got to take control
of ourselves...

01:14:22.306 --> 01:14:24.331
before we take control
of this camp.

01:14:24.375 --> 01:14:25.842
Who's with me?

01:14:25.876 --> 01:14:28.037
Who wants to do
this thing right?

01:14:29.079 --> 01:14:30.478
It's up to you.

01:14:38.222 --> 01:14:39.883
<i>I will.</i>

01:14:56.707 --> 01:14:59.369
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah!

01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:01.935
OK, let's go!

01:15:07.918 --> 01:15:11.012
Is a tomato
a fruit or a vegetable?

01:15:11.055 --> 01:15:13.023
- Fruit.
- That's right.

01:15:13.057 --> 01:15:17.357
Today, we're going to make
pasta primavera.

01:15:42.453 --> 01:15:44.819
Hey, how you doing?

01:15:49.526 --> 01:15:52.495
- There he is.
- Hey, I'm over here!

01:15:52.529 --> 01:15:55.293
Gerry! Oh!

01:15:55.332 --> 01:15:59.393
Hey, big guy. Look at you.

01:15:59.436 --> 01:16:01.904
- You look the same.
- I feel good.

01:16:01.939 --> 01:16:05.272
That's important, too.

01:16:05.309 --> 01:16:06.708
So?

01:16:06.744 --> 01:16:09.542
Come with me.
I'll take you around.

01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:12.572
- He hasn't lost a pound.
- Oh, Maury.

01:16:18.856 --> 01:16:21.791
Don't be frightened, Nicholas.

01:16:21.825 --> 01:16:23.816
I'm a beaten man.

01:16:45.282 --> 01:16:47.477
Good afternoon, everyone.

01:16:47.518 --> 01:16:50.214
Good afternoon.
I'm Pat Finley.

01:16:50.254 --> 01:16:51.653
You probably recognize me...

01:16:51.688 --> 01:16:53.849
from my work in the Camp Hope
promotional video.

01:16:53.891 --> 01:16:57.657
Right now, I'd like to play
another video...

01:16:57.694 --> 01:17:00.128
to show you people
just what it's been like...

01:17:00.164 --> 01:17:01.961
so far this summer.

01:17:01.999 --> 01:17:04.399
<i>This'll be great.</i>

01:17:04.434 --> 01:17:06.994
<i>Enjoy.</i>

01:17:12.109 --> 01:17:14.202
Aah!

01:17:15.679 --> 01:17:18.204
Die! Yaah!

01:17:20.017 --> 01:17:21.450
As a health care
professional...

01:17:21.485 --> 01:17:23.316
I would like to take
this opportunity...

01:17:23.353 --> 01:17:25.480
to warn you that
Tony Perkis's program...

01:17:25.522 --> 01:17:29.891
is not only ineffective,
it's downright dangerous.

01:17:32.596 --> 01:17:36.997
<i># Everywhere I go,</i>
<i>I'm late #</i>

01:17:37.034 --> 01:17:38.729
My grandma
runs faster than you...

01:17:38.769 --> 01:17:40.862
and she's only got one leg!

01:17:40.904 --> 01:17:42.735
<i>Say it one more time,</i>
<i>because it'll multiply.</i>

01:17:42.773 --> 01:17:45.105
- 40 push-ups?
- 60! Down! Now!

01:17:45.142 --> 01:17:46.609
- 80!
- I can't--

01:17:46.643 --> 01:17:49.373
He is strict.

01:18:01.291 --> 01:18:03.759
Kiss the ground, joker boy.

01:18:03.794 --> 01:18:06.763
Would you get
your foot off my back?

01:18:06.797 --> 01:18:09.061
Now you see what
we've been dealing with.

01:18:09.099 --> 01:18:12.034
Why didn't you tell us
about this?

01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:28.475
You've been
a good guard, Nicholas--

01:18:28.518 --> 01:18:30.543
strong and fair.

01:18:30.587 --> 01:18:34.887
Your queen would be proud.

01:18:34.925 --> 01:18:40.022
I'd like to reward you
with this chocolate kiss.

01:18:46.603 --> 01:18:48.127
<i>Oh!</i>

01:18:48.171 --> 01:18:49.502
Yeah!

01:18:49.539 --> 01:18:52.599
Where have you been
all my life?

01:18:52.643 --> 01:18:54.611
I'm going to love this.

01:18:54.645 --> 01:18:56.772
Oh, my God.
I'm going to be sick.

01:18:56.813 --> 01:18:57.973
Nice touch.

01:18:58.015 --> 01:19:00.279
I thought
I'd spice it up a little.

01:19:00.317 --> 01:19:03.252
It gives you
that warm feeling inside?

01:19:03.287 --> 01:19:05.084
Throw it over.

01:19:05.122 --> 01:19:07.317
But it would smush.

01:19:07.357 --> 01:19:09.518
That wouldn't be good.

01:19:11.662 --> 01:19:14.529
No dinner, no lunch,
no breakfast.

01:19:14.564 --> 01:19:16.964
How's that grab you?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.798
Take the candy.

01:19:21.738 --> 01:19:24.798
Nice and chocolatey.

01:19:24.841 --> 01:19:27.776
Chocolicious.

01:19:27.811 --> 01:19:30.439
Whoops.

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.175
Butterfingers.

01:19:36.153 --> 01:19:37.415
Aah!

01:19:37.454 --> 01:19:39.081
Well, well...

01:19:39.122 --> 01:19:42.057
looks like London bridge
is falling down, huh?

01:19:42.092 --> 01:19:43.320
Help!

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.588
How do you like the food
here at Camp Hope?

01:19:44.628 --> 01:19:45.822
It's good stuff.

01:19:45.862 --> 01:19:47.887
Wait till I finish
asking you the question.

01:19:47.931 --> 01:19:49.455
Just say,
"I love the food."

01:19:49.499 --> 01:19:51.126
- I love the food.
- Good. Here we go.

01:19:51.168 --> 01:19:52.760
So, Josh, how do you
like the food here?

01:19:52.803 --> 01:19:53.997
I love the food.

01:19:54.037 --> 01:19:55.698
Wait until
I finish the question!

01:19:55.739 --> 01:19:57.832
<i>Damn! Forget it!</i>

01:19:57.874 --> 01:20:00.001
If he isn't stopped
right away...

01:20:00.043 --> 01:20:04.070
somebody's child--
maybe yours--

01:20:04.114 --> 01:20:06.048
will be hurt.

01:20:06.083 --> 01:20:08.483
<i>Ho ho ho ho ho! Yes!</i>

01:20:08.518 --> 01:20:12.750
That was wonderful!

01:20:12.789 --> 01:20:14.723
Whoo!

01:20:14.758 --> 01:20:17.591
So entertaining.

01:20:17.627 --> 01:20:21.563
The cinematography,
the editing techniques.

01:20:21.598 --> 01:20:23.395
Though I must say...

01:20:23.433 --> 01:20:28.370
the villain
was a bit over the top.

01:20:31.742 --> 01:20:35.405
Ouch.
Everyone having fun?

01:20:35.445 --> 01:20:37.504
Parents!

01:20:37.547 --> 01:20:41.381
You're the cause of
all my--their problems!

01:20:41.418 --> 01:20:42.851
He escaped!

01:20:42.886 --> 01:20:44.945
You little
British butterball...

01:20:44.988 --> 01:20:46.853
I ought to show you what
it means to be an American!

01:20:46.890 --> 01:20:48.881
Now you realize what
we've been dealing with.

01:20:48.925 --> 01:20:50.358
He has to be stopped!

01:20:50.394 --> 01:20:53.488
Ho ho! Stop me, hmm?

01:20:56.833 --> 01:21:00.496
Uhh! I'm too strong!

01:21:00.537 --> 01:21:02.698
Uhh! Ah!

01:21:02.739 --> 01:21:05.970
I'm too motivated!

01:21:06.009 --> 01:21:09.308
And you're too weak!

01:21:09.346 --> 01:21:12.474
Aah! Uhh!

01:21:12.516 --> 01:21:14.814
Especially you,
Garner, Gerald...

01:21:14.851 --> 01:21:18.287
age 11, 141 pounds!

01:21:18.321 --> 01:21:20.414
So, come on!
You want a piece of me, Pops?

01:21:20.457 --> 01:21:23.255
No one's taking
this camp away from me!

01:21:23.293 --> 01:21:26.057
Ooh!

01:21:26.096 --> 01:21:29.896
I'm afraid you're wrong.
You are through here.

01:21:29.933 --> 01:21:32.800
- Are you OK?
- I'm all right.

01:21:32.836 --> 01:21:34.428
You have to take a stand.

01:21:34.471 --> 01:21:37.338
Uhh! Guhh!

01:21:38.575 --> 01:21:39.769
<i>Oh!</i>

01:21:41.311 --> 01:21:45.543
Uhh! Ahh!

01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:56.957
<i>- We did it, Roy.</i>
<i>- Yes, we did.</i>

01:21:59.296 --> 01:22:02.459
Sorry to ask you to deal
with this, Mr. Perkis.

01:22:02.499 --> 01:22:04.262
That kid was always
a little off.

01:22:04.301 --> 01:22:05.598
My parents didn't hug me.

01:22:05.635 --> 01:22:08.103
You don't see me freaking out
like a little baby.

01:22:09.906 --> 01:22:11.874
I'm going to take a bath
on this.

01:22:11.908 --> 01:22:13.341
Listen, everybody...

01:22:13.376 --> 01:22:15.742
don't freak out,
don't call your lawyers.

01:22:15.779 --> 01:22:17.041
We'll get you your money back.

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.809
We make nice,
everybody's happy,

01:22:18.849 --> 01:22:20.680
But for now,
we close down the camp.

01:22:20.717 --> 01:22:22.150
Everybody go home.

01:22:22.185 --> 01:22:23.880
Have a nice summer.
I got to get out of here.

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:27.549
I'd love to chat.
Good luck to all of you.

01:22:27.591 --> 01:22:29.559
- Say something.
- Mr. Perkis, sir.

01:22:29.593 --> 01:22:30.958
Papa.

01:22:30.994 --> 01:22:34.623
Papa, we don't want to go home.

01:22:34.664 --> 01:22:35.858
Wait a minute.

01:22:35.899 --> 01:22:37.298
If you kids
want to stick it out...

01:22:37.334 --> 01:22:39.461
all I need to do is
put an adult in charge--

01:22:39.503 --> 01:22:43.963
put it on the responsibility
clause for the insurance.

01:22:44.007 --> 01:22:46.339
Who's been here the longest?

01:22:46.376 --> 01:22:50.039
- Four years.
- One year.

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.274
- Two.
- Four years.

01:22:51.314 --> 01:22:52.872
- Three.
- Five.

01:22:52.916 --> 01:22:55.316
Eighteen years.

01:22:55.352 --> 01:22:57.081
Eighteen?

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:59.315
- Whoa.
- 18 years.

01:22:59.356 --> 01:23:01.688
What the hell have you
been doing with yourself?

01:23:01.725 --> 01:23:04.387
Are you up to it?

01:23:06.663 --> 01:23:08.654
Pat. Pat.

01:23:08.698 --> 01:23:12.099
Pat! Pat! Pat!

01:23:18.975 --> 01:23:20.169
I'll sure try.

01:23:20.210 --> 01:23:22.371
Hooray.
Ooh, yeah, OK.

01:23:22.412 --> 01:23:23.777
Congratulations.
Here you go.

01:23:23.813 --> 01:23:26.907
Do the hokey-pokey
and knock yourself out.

01:23:31.655 --> 01:23:32.815
All right, Pat.

01:23:32.856 --> 01:23:34.653
Enjoy yourselves.
You deserve it.

01:23:35.759 --> 01:23:37.021
I'm proud of you.

01:23:42.599 --> 01:23:44.624
<i>Dear Grandma...</i>

01:23:44.667 --> 01:23:46.635
<i>things have really</i>
<i>turned around at camp.</i>

01:23:46.736 --> 01:23:49.102
<i>We're finally having</i>
<i>a great time.</i>

01:23:49.138 --> 01:23:51.299
Uhh!

01:23:51.341 --> 01:23:53.536
Whoo!

01:23:53.576 --> 01:23:56.807
Yee-haw!

01:23:59.249 --> 01:24:02.150
<i>We're in control,</i>
<i>and we like it.</i>

01:24:02.185 --> 01:24:04.983
<i>We're putting things back</i>
<i>to the way they were...</i>

01:24:05.021 --> 01:24:07.455
<i>and no one is going</i>
<i>to mess it up again.</i>

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:13.620
Hey, Chris.

01:24:13.663 --> 01:24:16.063
Where's the motor, man?

01:24:16.099 --> 01:24:17.691
<i>With Pat in charge...</i>

01:24:17.734 --> 01:24:19.998
<i>we are united,</i>
<i>and we are strong.</i>

01:24:20.036 --> 01:24:21.264
Can I get that wrench,
Phillip?

01:24:21.304 --> 01:24:23.704
Thank you.
Josh, how we doing?

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:25.901
Got a bent axle over here.

01:24:25.942 --> 01:24:27.409
<i>We can do anything...</i>

01:24:27.443 --> 01:24:31.504
<i>even take on Camp MVP</i>
<i>in the Apache Relay.</i>

01:24:31.547 --> 01:24:34.482
<i>And we can win--I think.</i>

01:24:34.517 --> 01:24:36.280
<i>Welcome, everybody...</i>

01:24:36.319 --> 01:24:39.220
<i>to the 33rd Annual</i>
<i>Apache Relay games</i>--

01:24:39.255 --> 01:24:41.621
<i>the favorites, Camp MVP...</i>

01:24:41.658 --> 01:24:44.559
<i>versus the perennial losers,</i>
<i>Camp Hope.</i>

01:24:44.594 --> 01:24:47.427
<i>This relay today</i>
<i>will consist of three parts--</i>

01:24:47.463 --> 01:24:50.830
<i>an obstacle course,</i>
<i>the Hall of Intelligence...</i>

01:24:50.867 --> 01:24:52.858
<i>and the Grand Prix.</i>

01:24:52.902 --> 01:24:55.200
May the best team win.

01:24:55.238 --> 01:24:57.297
All right, Cody,
give it your best shot.

01:24:57.340 --> 01:24:59.035
<i>Put a little pizzazz in it.</i>

01:24:59.075 --> 01:25:02.044
<i>On your mark, get set...</i>

01:25:12.055 --> 01:25:13.886
Get up, get up!

01:25:17.994 --> 01:25:19.393
Uhh!

01:25:19.429 --> 01:25:21.488
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>an MVP romp again, folks.</i>

01:25:23.533 --> 01:25:24.795
Uhh!

01:25:26.235 --> 01:25:29.363
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:49.482
Here, take it!

01:25:49.525 --> 01:25:55.486
Whoa!

01:25:55.531 --> 01:25:58.398
<i>Keep going.</i>
<i>You got it, man. Yeah.</i>

01:25:58.434 --> 01:26:00.595
<i>It's just a couple more.</i>

01:26:00.636 --> 01:26:02.001
<i>Come on.</i>

01:26:03.573 --> 01:26:05.040
Up. All right, here.

01:26:05.074 --> 01:26:07.269
OK. All right. Ready?

01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:08.675
Uhh!

01:26:14.617 --> 01:26:15.914
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:26:18.287 --> 01:26:21.745
- Aww.
- Give me the balloon.

01:26:21.791 --> 01:26:26.524
<i>All right.</i>
<i>You can do it. It's easy.</i>

01:26:26.562 --> 01:26:28.894
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:26:35.271 --> 01:26:36.636
I know you thought
we'd get creamed...

01:26:36.672 --> 01:26:40.768
but I don't think
you'll get creamed riding this.

01:26:40.810 --> 01:26:42.368
Whoa!

01:26:42.412 --> 01:26:44.676
Did a little work on the motor.

01:26:44.714 --> 01:26:45.874
Whoa.

01:26:45.915 --> 01:26:48.440
You better
take that feather off.

01:26:48.484 --> 01:26:51.647
I don't think
it'll fit under this.

01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:56.584
<i>Camp MVP is</i>
<i>setting a course record...</i>

01:26:56.626 --> 01:26:59.060
<i>as they move into</i>
<i>the Hall of Intelligence.</i>

01:27:06.302 --> 01:27:07.735
Solve the equation.

01:27:07.770 --> 01:27:09.294
- 55.
- No.

01:27:09.338 --> 01:27:11.238
- 17?
- Nein.

01:27:11.274 --> 01:27:12.434
Nine is the answer?

01:27:12.475 --> 01:27:14.500
"Nein" is German for "no."

01:27:18.114 --> 01:27:19.979
Artist and title, please.

01:27:20.016 --> 01:27:21.415
Cher?

01:27:23.086 --> 01:27:24.314
No.

01:27:24.353 --> 01:27:26.913
<i>Solve the equation.</i>

01:27:28.724 --> 01:27:29.918
Eleven.

01:27:29.959 --> 01:27:32.985
Wunderbar. You may advance.

01:27:33.029 --> 01:27:36.260
You must now name
five American vice presidents.

01:27:36.299 --> 01:27:38.358
Quayle.

01:27:38.401 --> 01:27:40.528
- George Washington.
- No.

01:27:40.570 --> 01:27:43.971
- Quayle.
- You said that already.

01:27:44.006 --> 01:27:45.871
Cher?

01:27:45.908 --> 01:27:47.671
Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa."

01:27:47.710 --> 01:27:50.474
Van Gogh's
"Houses at Auvers."

01:27:50.513 --> 01:27:54.108
Botticelli's "La Primavera."

01:27:54.150 --> 01:27:55.412
<i>Over at</i>
<i>the Hall of Intelligence...</i>

01:27:55.451 --> 01:27:57.817
<i>Camp Hope has almost</i>
<i>caught up to Camp MVP.</i>

01:27:57.854 --> 01:27:59.185
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

01:27:59.222 --> 01:28:01.122
<i>This is going to be</i>
<i>quite some finish, folks.</i>

01:28:01.157 --> 01:28:03.022
Right is gas,
left is brake.

01:28:04.861 --> 01:28:07.193
- Alexander Haig?
- Sorry.

01:28:07.230 --> 01:28:10.427
- Caught you.
- Shut up.

01:28:10.466 --> 01:28:13.526
Nicholas, name five
American vice presidents.

01:28:13.569 --> 01:28:16.367
Levi P. Morton,
John Calhoun...

01:28:16.405 --> 01:28:19.135
Hubert Humphrey,
Spiro Agnew...

01:28:19.175 --> 01:28:20.699
Walter Mondale.

01:28:20.743 --> 01:28:22.904
That's perfect.
You may advance.

01:28:22.945 --> 01:28:26.142
You Americans
have no sense of history.

01:28:26.182 --> 01:28:28.514
<i>Home stretch! Go, go!</i>

01:28:28.551 --> 01:28:30.576
Accelerate into the turns.
Don't forget.

01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:31.917
Use your weight.
Lean into them.

01:28:31.954 --> 01:28:34.889
Be careful.
This guy drives dirty.

01:28:34.924 --> 01:28:37.222
<i>- Thanks, Pat.</i>
<i>- Go get 'em.</i>

01:28:41.397 --> 01:28:43.729
Nicholas!

01:28:45.868 --> 01:28:47.665
Come on!

01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:52.872
I don't want to put
any pressure on you, Big Al...

01:28:52.909 --> 01:28:56.242
but we have never lost
this race, all right?

01:28:58.147 --> 01:29:00.308
Don't forget your wings, man.

01:29:02.919 --> 01:29:04.978
Take 'em down, Captain.

01:29:40.656 --> 01:29:42.920
Yeah! Ah ha!

01:29:47.029 --> 01:29:49.793
Hey! Back off!

01:29:51.334 --> 01:29:53.234
Whoa!

01:29:53.269 --> 01:29:55.203
<i>Ha ha!</i>
<i>So long, sucker!</i>

01:29:55.238 --> 01:29:57.229
Whoa! Aah!

01:29:59.508 --> 01:30:01.339
Uhh!

01:30:03.346 --> 01:30:05.678
Oh, shoot!

01:30:05.715 --> 01:30:07.512
Come on!

01:30:19.462 --> 01:30:21.487
Oh, no! Oh!

01:30:35.411 --> 01:30:38.175
Go, Gerry.
They're coming!

01:30:38.214 --> 01:30:40.011
<i>All right, all right.</i>

01:30:42.752 --> 01:30:44.617
Go! Go, Gerry!

01:30:49.859 --> 01:30:52.327
Hey! Come on!

01:30:52.361 --> 01:30:55.956
- Come on!
- No!

01:31:06.342 --> 01:31:07.570
Unh!

01:31:10.379 --> 01:31:11.573
He's still behind!

01:31:13.883 --> 01:31:15.350
He can't pass!

01:31:18.387 --> 01:31:19.854
Come on! Unh!

01:31:19.889 --> 01:31:21.652
No way!

01:31:21.691 --> 01:31:23.921
Come on, Captain!
Come on, baby!

01:31:40.843 --> 01:31:42.037
Ohhh.

01:31:47.450 --> 01:31:51.443
Oooooooh!

01:31:56.392 --> 01:31:58.587
Aah! Yeah!

01:31:58.627 --> 01:31:59.924
Oh!

01:32:09.605 --> 01:32:11.630
All right, Gerry!

01:32:11.674 --> 01:32:15.269
- I flew, Pat!
- I know!

01:32:15.311 --> 01:32:16.835
Hip-hip hooray!

01:32:16.879 --> 01:32:20.542
Hip-hip hooray!
Hip-hip hooray!

01:32:26.789 --> 01:32:29.189
- Yeah!
- All right!

01:32:31.861 --> 01:32:35.729
You'll be happy to know that
we're filing a formal protest.

01:32:35.765 --> 01:32:37.232
That cup belongs to us.

01:32:37.266 --> 01:32:39.928
Oh, the cup?
This is what you want?

01:32:39.969 --> 01:32:42.233
This is what your life
is all about, Chris?

01:32:42.271 --> 01:32:45.138
I tell you what,
I'll airmail it...

01:32:45.174 --> 01:32:46.539
back to camp for you,
all right?

01:32:46.575 --> 01:32:48.736
Take care of that, Simms?

01:32:56.018 --> 01:32:58.350
You're crazy!

01:32:58.387 --> 01:32:59.615
You bet I'm crazy.

01:32:59.655 --> 01:33:01.623
<i>Come on! Get that cup!</i>

01:33:01.657 --> 01:33:04.148
- Oh!
- Crazy about my gal.

01:33:04.193 --> 01:33:07.287
Whoo!

01:33:14.904 --> 01:33:16.269
Whoo!

01:33:20.376 --> 01:33:21.968
Hey, Pat...

01:33:22.011 --> 01:33:24.343
thanks for the best
damn summer of my life!

01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:26.143
Same here, Captain.

01:33:27.583 --> 01:33:29.073
Whoo!

01:33:37.659 --> 01:33:38.819
All right, guys!

01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:41.385
Let's sing the inspiring
Camp Hope song!

01:33:42.697 --> 01:33:44.460
Aw, come on! Here we go!

01:33:44.499 --> 01:33:47.229
<i># Camp Hope, Camp Hope,
we sing to thee #</i>

01:33:47.269 --> 01:33:48.429

<i># The greatest camp

01:33:51.306 --> 01:33:53.672
Come on, Tim,
that song's boring.

01:33:53.708 --> 01:33:54.868
Sing something cool.

01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:56.673
You want to hear
something cool?

01:33:56.711 --> 01:33:58.975
OK, cats, let's rock it.

01:34:02.851 --> 01:34:05.081
Yow...huh!

01:34:06.955 --> 01:34:09.515
<i># Camp Hope, Camp Hope,

<i># Make sure
the shower door is shut #</i>

01:34:17.933 --> 01:34:19.833
<i># Or else the 'squitos
bite your butt #</i>

01:34:19.868 --> 01:34:22.029
<i># And don't swim past
when your friends make #</i>

01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:23.833
<i># A warm spot in the lake #</i>

01:34:23.872 --> 01:34:26.033
All right, guys,
you're getting the hang of it!

01:34:26.074 --> 01:34:27.336
Come on!

01:34:27.375 --> 01:34:29.343

Hey, look who's here!

Stop!
Stop that stupid song!

01:35:12.988 --> 01:35:14.250
You call that music?

01:35:14.289 --> 01:35:17.850
<i># I know you think
you're all rock stars #</i>

01:35:17.892 --> 01:35:20.986

an oompah song from Lars #</i>

01:35:21.029 --> 01:35:23.725
<i># About my favorite
Camp Hope job #</i>

01:35:23.765 --> 01:35:26.427

I harpooned the Blob #</i>

to make it very clear #</i>

01:35:29.204 --> 01:35:32.071
<i># I was not scared of

01:35:32.107 --> 01:35:34.735

<i># I still enjoy Camp Hope #</i>

01:35:37.245 --> 01:35:39.338
Thanks, Lars.
That's great.

01:35:39.381 --> 01:35:41.315
All right, guys,
you ready to take it home?

01:35:41.349 --> 01:35:43.214
- Yeah!
- Let's rock!

01:35:43.251 --> 01:35:45.685
<i># Camp Hope, Camp Hope,

All right, guys,
that sounds great, yeah!

01:36:10.879 --> 01:36:12.642
We got a bunch of
heavyweights here?

01:36:12.681 --> 01:36:14.046
Are you guys heavyweights?

01:36:14.082 --> 01:36:16.949
I said, are you
guys heavyweights?

01:36:16.985 --> 01:36:18.179
Gerry,
are you a heavyweight?

01:36:18.219 --> 01:36:19.846
- Yeah!
- All right, Gerry!

01:36:19.888 --> 01:36:21.879
Now the rest of you guys!
Are you all heavyweights?

01:36:21.923 --> 01:36:23.083
Yeah!

01:36:23.124 --> 01:36:25.354
Counselors,
are we all heavyweights?

01:36:25.393 --> 01:36:26.860
Yeah!
We're heavyweights!

01:36:26.895 --> 01:36:28.920
- Pat, are you heavyweight?
- I'm a heavyweight!

01:36:28.963 --> 01:36:30.430
Nurse Julie,
are you a heavyweight?

01:36:30.465 --> 01:36:31.727
I'm a heavyweight!

01:36:31.766 --> 01:36:34.792
- Lars, are you a heavyweight?
- I'm a heavyweight, Tim!

01:36:34.836 --> 01:36:36.895
Kenny the cameraman,
are you a heavyweight?

01:36:36.938 --> 01:36:40.465
- Yes, I'm a heavyweight.
- We're all heavyweights!

01:36:40.508 --> 01:36:43.477
So, Lars, you think
you're coming back next year?

01:36:43.511 --> 01:36:45.706
I don't know, Tim.
I live very far away.

01:36:45.747 --> 01:36:47.180
We'll fly you in.

01:36:47.215 --> 01:36:49.410
Kenny the cameraman,
think you can make it back?

01:36:49.451 --> 01:36:51.146
I might be able
to work something out.

01:36:51.186 --> 01:36:53.416
That'd be very nice.

01:36:53.455 --> 01:36:55.548
What do you say, guys?
Does Camp Hope rule?

01:36:57.058 --> 01:36:59.356
Pat, did you hurt
yourself on the Blob?

01:36:59.394 --> 01:37:01.487
Yeah.
I tore my rotator cuff.

01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:07.734
Good afternoon.

01:37:07.769 --> 01:37:08.963
I know what you're thinking.

01:37:09.003 --> 01:37:11.631
"Another guy hawking healing
crystals door-to-door."

01:37:11.673 --> 01:37:13.163
I don't like
to call them crystals.

01:37:13.208 --> 01:37:15.733
I like to call them
"transformational facilitators."

01:37:15.777 --> 01:37:17.472
Perhaps--
