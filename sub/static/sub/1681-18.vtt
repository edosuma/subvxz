00:02.090 --> 00:03.070
I've been hired to design

00:03.070 --> 00:05.650
a new headquarters for Goliath National Bank.

00:05.850 --> 00:08.010
And I was eager to add as much of my voices

00:08.010 --> 00:10.050
as an architect into the plan as possible.

00:10.050 --> 00:14.140

00:15.680 --> 00:17.280

They're gonna to love it!

00:17.280 --> 00:18.860
There was only one problem

00:19.240 --> 00:21.250
and his name was Bilson

00:21.250 --> 00:23.530
wood natural light

00:23.530 --> 00:25.510
Ah,no!

00:25.510 --> 00:29.110
Natural light reminds the workers that there's an outside world

00:29.110 --> 00:31.290
where they had family and friends

00:31.290 --> 00:33.100
We want to crash that!

00:33.100 --> 00:36.200
You show up in the dark, you go home in the dark

00:36.370 --> 00:40.170
You spend your whole damn day in the dark!

00:40.230 --> 00:42.880

00:42.880 --> 00:44.200
Who said you could leave

00:45.640 --> 00:48.480
Bilson was killing every original idea I had

00:48.480 --> 00:49.260
Then, one day

00:49.260 --> 00:51.070
GNB took him off the project

00:51.070 --> 00:54.220
to created a new task force to oversee my designs

00:54.220 --> 00:55.960
suddenly, everything changed

00:56.110 --> 00:57.160
We'll have a roof top in the end of the garden

00:57.160 --> 00:59.060
for quiet contemplation

00:59.060 --> 01:00.570
We'll have a reflecting pool in the lobby

01:00.570 --> 01:04.190

01:04.190 --> 01:05.370

01:05.370 --> 01:07.800

01:07.800 --> 01:10.690

01:10.690 --> 01:15.520
Thank you, and welcome home.

01:21.130 --> 01:22.540
Everything was going great,

01:22.820 --> 01:24.780

01:47.630 --> 01:50.180
Alright, goodbye, Mr. Mayor.

01:51.790 --> 01:53.810

01:53.810 --> 01:56.000

Oh my god! Seriously

02:51.240 --> 02:54.320
Yeah, he wanted to do this really freaky things with me,

No, no, not end of the story

03:07.400 --> 03:10.560
I'm flattered, but technically, I'm not a celebrity.

03:11.250 --> 03:14.900
Plus, for the last time, I put the mask on as a joke.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.410
OK, not you Barney.

03:16.410 --> 03:17.970
OK, who is it

03:18.750 --> 03:21.750
OK, now you give Lily the hiccups.

03:21.750 --> 03:23.970
Ok, I won't tell you anything specific.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.880
But all I'll say

03:25.880 --> 03:27.340
is that he is Canadian born,

03:27.340 --> 03:28.480
but you definitely know this guy.

03:28.510 --> 03:30.480
And he got me back to his place

03:30.480 --> 03:33.370
by offering to show me a very unique collection.

03:33.370 --> 03:34.680

This woman at GNB told me

04:27.280 --> 04:29.780
that the new bank building was scrapped last month.

04:29.780 --> 04:30.940

04:36.260 --> 04:37.000
There was no look.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.740
Guys, what the hell

04:39.280 --> 04:41.500
Ok, it's that you know the truth.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.880
A few weeks ago, Bilson called us into his office.

04:44.880 --> 04:48.000
We're scrapping the plan for the new GNB headquarters.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.570
This recession is killing us.

04:50.570 --> 04:52.510
We're cutting anything non-essential.

04:53.350 --> 04:54.900

04:54.900 --> 04:57.900
to buy courtly retreat in Saint Croix.

04:58.770 --> 05:00.660
Man, Ted is gonna be devastated.

-I have to tell him  -I have to tell him

05:05.580 --> 05:07.050
You should tell him, you're his best friend.

05:07.050 --> 05:08.340
I'm not, you're his best friend.

05:08.340 --> 05:09.540
I'm not, you're his best friend.

05:09.540 --> 05:11.350

-Hey, Ted, what's up  -Hey, how're you doing

05:18.180 --> 05:19.330
I'm frustrated.

05:19.330 --> 05:21.490
Anything innovative I put on my designs

05:21.490 --> 05:23.790
Bilson just hacks out with a shitty

05:23.790 --> 05:25.900
I hate to answer to a guy like that.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.360
You should drop the project.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.970
You should totally drop the project.

Then it's settled. To Ted Mosby's new chapter...

05:32.960 --> 05:36.500

05:36.500 --> 05:38.840
I mean Bilson is a pain sure.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.220
But without this project, I'm probably out of job.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.770
Right, it's funny that you metioned the project.

05:44.770 --> 05:46.250
-...  -
-Because...  -You're nailing it.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.620

05:56.860 --> 05:58.900
All right, I'm going to head upstairs and keep working.

05:58.930 --> 06:00.700
I got to find a way to introduce some wood

06:00.730 --> 06:02.000
into Bilson's dark atrium.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.200
I think you know what I meant.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.460

-What was that -What

06:09.500 --> 06:10.860
I have a thought.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.700
Okay, we're paying Ted's firm

06:12.730 --> 06:14.500
for two more months of design work no matter what,

06:14.530 --> 06:15.800
so couldn't we just let him

06:15.830 --> 06:17.960
keep working and not tell him

06:18.000 --> 06:19.500
He's had a rough year.

06:19.530 --> 06:21.330
Let's let the guy be happy a little while longer.

06:21.360 --> 06:24.030
Marshall, what you're suggesting

06:24.060 --> 06:26.430

06:26.460 --> 06:28.130
that requires tremendous commitment.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.330

06:37.960 --> 06:39.030
Okay, I don't have a spaceship.

06:39.060 --> 06:40.660
No!

06:40.700 --> 06:42.000

06:42.030 --> 06:43.560

06:43.600 --> 06:46.200

Here, let me demonstrate.

06:47.230 --> 06:48.330

Okay.

06:51.860 --> 06:54.930
Um, what color is your pony

06:54.960 --> 06:56.100
Well, when I first got Dandelion,

06:56.130 --> 06:58.100
she was a deep, chestnut brown,

06:58.130 --> 07:01.230
but, sadly, her stable is located near a chemical plant,

07:01.260 --> 07:02.930
which contaminated the drinking water.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.400
So over time, she's turned a sickly, grayish-white color

07:06.430 --> 07:09.530
and there's nothing that the vet can do to fix her.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.030
My God!

07:11.060 --> 07:12.800
I'm-- That's horrible.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.030
Is Dandelion going to be okay

07:15.060 --> 07:16.400
Okay.

07:16.430 --> 07:17.400
All right. Huh

07:17.430 --> 07:18.730

07:18.760 --> 07:21.360

13:50.700 --> 13:52.060
What exactly would I be doing

13:52.100 --> 13:55.060
18ETR
This is the 18th Floor E.T.R.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.630
Basically, Bilson wants a room just like this,

13:57.660 --> 13:59.330
only two stories up, on our floor.

Wait, what's an E.T.R.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.800
It's the Employee Transition Room.

14:02.830 --> 14:05.300

-What does that mean -Well, it's a space

14:05.330 --> 14:07.460

engage in a knowledge transfer

14:09.330 --> 14:12.000
about an impending vocational paradigm shift.

14:13.130 --> 14:14.330
People get fired in here.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.600
That's horrible.

14:16.630 --> 14:18.800
Why do you need a room specifically for firing people

14:18.830 --> 14:22.130
Well, um, GNB feels that people need a safe,

14:22.160 --> 14:24.560
secure space to deal with the news.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.960
Yeah.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.030
It gets pretty real in here.

15:13.730 --> 15:16.630
So I reluctantly agreed to design a room

15:16.660 --> 15:18.300
where people would be fired

15:18.330 --> 15:19.930

19:43.100 --> 19:46.360
As it turns out, I'm grateful.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.560
So how'd it all go down between you and Bilson

19:50.600 --> 19:54.360
Well, after he proposed a vocational paradigm shift,

19:54.400 --> 19:57.400
I made an impromptu presentation using a four-pronged approach

19:57.430 --> 19:58.860
that really brought him to his knees.

19:58.900 --> 19:59.860
Hit him with a chair

19:59.900 --> 20:01.400
-  -
-Yep. -That's my boy.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.030
And this one, I got on the drive

20:07.060 --> 20:08.230
from Milverton to Wawa.

20:09.800 --> 20:13.000
That's pretty impressive, The Frozen Snowshoe.

20:13.030 --> 20:15.030
Please, we're friends. Just call me "Shoe."

20:16.060 --> 20:17.400
Have a seat.

20:22.530 --> 20:24.660
So, Shoe...

20:24.700 --> 20:27.200
How would you like to give me...

20:29.200 --> 20:31.560
an Old King Clancy

20:34.600 --> 20:35.930
I think you should go.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
