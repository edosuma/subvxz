WEBVTT

00:05.325 --> 00:06.524
Please?

00:07.845 --> 00:09.045
Don't hurt me any more.

00:12.093 --> 00:14.368
(sobbing)
Please, just kill me.

00:14.912 --> 00:16.111
Not yet, Becky.

00:17.014 --> 00:18.414
We're still having fun.

00:18.415 --> 00:19.515
No.

00:19.516 --> 00:21.718
(gasping)
No. No.

00:22.553 --> 00:24.754

00:34.164 --> 00:37.033
(breathing heavily)

00:45.776 --> 00:47.210
How did the judge rule?

00:47.211 --> 00:49.412
Unfortunately,
to void this felony conviction

00:49.413 --> 00:50.747
because the case was

00:50.748 --> 00:53.349
predicated solely
on tainted DNA evidence.

00:53.350 --> 00:54.984
Three out of five.

00:54.985 --> 00:56.653
So far,
that's the batting average

00:56.654 --> 00:58.187
of the DAs in other boroughs.

00:58.188 --> 01:00.957
Still, two criminals
back on the streets

01:00.958 --> 01:03.693
because of a lab tech's
shoddy work?

01:03.694 --> 01:05.028
(sighs)

01:05.029 --> 01:06.863
Thank you, Counselor.

01:06.864 --> 01:08.331
Thank you, Commissioner.

01:17.341 --> 01:18.474
Who's up next?

01:18.475 --> 01:20.343
Manhattan District Attorney,
sir.

01:20.344 --> 01:21.978
Send him in.

01:24.081 --> 01:26.282
Commissioner.

01:29.603 --> 01:32.088
Counselor.

01:32.089 --> 01:33.523
Please.

01:36.276 --> 01:39.262
So, where are we, Counselor?

01:39.263 --> 01:42.165
I've found grounds
to hold without bail and retry

01:42.166 --> 01:43.833
four of the
prisoners in question.

01:43.834 --> 01:45.201
Good.

01:45.202 --> 01:46.803
There are two
outstanding problems.

01:46.804 --> 01:49.105
Garth Kraver, pedophile.

01:49.106 --> 01:51.674
Convicted on three counts
of sexual conduct

01:51.675 --> 01:53.576
on a child
in the first degree.

01:53.577 --> 01:55.111
The judge is set to rule

01:55.112 --> 01:56.479
on whether to vacate
this conviction.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.681
Where do you think
the judge will come down?

01:58.682 --> 02:02.518
I'm worried, but not as worried
as I am about Dick Reed.

02:02.519 --> 02:04.687
(sighs)

02:04.688 --> 02:06.756
I've prosecuted
some animals before, but

02:06.757 --> 02:10.560
what he did to those three women
before he killed them...

02:11.729 --> 02:13.496
The worst of the worst.

02:13.497 --> 02:15.298
Our best chance on this is

02:15.299 --> 02:18.034
if I can get Becky Watalski
to testify

02:18.035 --> 02:19.802
in a new trial.

02:19.803 --> 02:21.537
I've gone to see her three times

02:21.538 --> 02:24.040
to persuade her
to testify, but...

02:25.109 --> 02:27.193
Becky is Reed's only
surviving victim.

02:27.194 --> 02:28.945
"Tortured for 19 hours.
She had

02:28.946 --> 02:32.148
"the presence of mind to free
herself from her burning bed

02:32.149 --> 02:34.617
by holding her bindings
over the flames."

02:34.618 --> 02:36.953
She was still able to provide
a detailed description

02:36.954 --> 02:38.221
that led us to Reed.

02:38.222 --> 02:39.389
We had enough

02:39.390 --> 02:40.757
DNA evidence to convict him

02:40.758 --> 02:42.759
on the three murder charges,

02:42.760 --> 02:44.660
and due to her fragile state,

02:44.661 --> 02:46.696
we did not have to try her case.

02:46.697 --> 02:48.264
We'll have a constant watch
on Reed,

02:48.265 --> 02:50.800
and you'll find a way
to put him back behind bars,

02:50.801 --> 02:52.568
Counselor.
(phone beeps)

02:52.569 --> 02:54.270
Kings County
DA's here, sir.

02:54.271 --> 02:56.973
See to him, Baker.

03:04.531 --> 03:06.249
So, where's your boss?

03:06.250 --> 03:08.367
On a plane to Scottsdale.

03:08.368 --> 03:10.586
Nice of him
to drop this mess in your lap.

03:10.587 --> 03:12.155
In Charley's defense,

03:12.156 --> 03:14.574
he was scheduled to speak
at the DA's conference

03:14.575 --> 03:15.892
months ago.

03:15.893 --> 03:17.960
Charley Rossellini wasn't shy
about taking credit

03:17.961 --> 03:21.431
when he put these perps away,
but now that the heat's on...

03:26.103 --> 03:29.055
You know, that son of a
bitch Reed was smiling

03:29.056 --> 03:30.773
through the
whole trial?

03:30.774 --> 03:32.442
Stay after him, sweetheart.

03:32.443 --> 03:34.610
I will, Dad.

03:39.983 --> 03:42.118
DANNY:
<i>I don't get it.</i>

03:42.119 --> 03:43.236
I don't get it.

03:43.237 --> 03:45.321
I busted my hump
trying to lock that guy up.

03:45.322 --> 03:46.989
Now he's gonna
get out of jail free

03:46.990 --> 03:49.992
because some lab nerd's
all stressed out and overworked?

03:49.993 --> 03:52.111
Ah, in a warm
lab, no less.

03:52.112 --> 03:53.279
Mm, with warm coffee.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.865
Oh, warm coffee.
Look.

03:55.866 --> 03:57.366
JACKIE: Oh, here comes
the prison bus.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.202
DANNY:
The slimeball express.

03:59.203 --> 04:00.736
WOMAN: Get up close,
right up front.

04:00.737 --> 04:02.205
Right this way.

04:09.930 --> 04:12.014
WOMAN: There he is, there he is.
(WOMAN 2) Yay!

04:12.015 --> 04:13.950
There he is!

04:13.951 --> 04:16.052
JACKIE:
Look at this party.

04:16.053 --> 04:17.320
Oh, geez.

04:18.137 --> 04:19.922
MAN:
Reed!

04:19.923 --> 04:21.390
There he is.
(applause)

04:21.391 --> 04:23.092
(laughing)
DANNY: Dick Reed, the rapist.

04:23.093 --> 04:25.058
JACKIE:
Don't forget murderer.

04:25.059 --> 04:26.428
DANNY:
It's disgusting.

04:26.429 --> 04:27.729
MAN:
Look this way.

04:27.730 --> 04:29.909
So that's what pure evil
looks like up close.

04:29.910 --> 04:30.556
Yeah.

04:30.581 --> 04:32.632
Makes his bus mates
who did their time

04:32.633 --> 04:34.650
look like saints.
Yeah, how about

04:34.651 --> 04:37.937
the whack job
welcoming committee?

04:37.938 --> 04:39.355
This guy's got a fan club.

04:39.356 --> 04:40.923
It's amazing.
You got to be

04:40.924 --> 04:44.861
some kind of nut to obsess
over a scumbag like this.

04:44.862 --> 04:46.762
- Excuse me.
- Excuse us.

04:46.763 --> 04:48.264
Taxi!

04:48.265 --> 04:51.433
Hey, Dick,
what's the rush?

04:53.821 --> 04:56.873
Oh, yeah.

04:56.874 --> 04:58.841
So you're the cop

04:58.842 --> 05:01.294
who worked the
Katie Snow case,

05:01.295 --> 05:03.713
unfortunate victim number two.

05:03.714 --> 05:07.617
Very vivid description
you gave that jury. Ooh!

05:07.618 --> 05:08.918
Yeah, I'm good like that.

05:08.919 --> 05:10.586
How about
we give you a ride?

05:10.587 --> 05:13.256
I mean, we're gonna be
all over your ass anyway, so,

05:13.257 --> 05:14.790
we might as well
get reacquainted.

05:14.791 --> 05:15.925
(laughs)

05:15.926 --> 05:17.426
That's a two-way
street, friend.

05:17.427 --> 05:18.561
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:18.562 --> 05:19.962
So, if you want to
keep your badge,

05:19.963 --> 05:21.597
better stay off my ass.
Really?

05:21.598 --> 05:24.433
Harassment. Section 2-40-26

05:24.434 --> 05:26.269
of the penal code.
Penal code.

05:26.270 --> 05:27.687
Look it up.

05:27.688 --> 05:31.107
I bet you studied up
a lot about penal codes.

05:31.108 --> 05:32.992
That's good for a rapist.

05:32.993 --> 05:34.643
Enjoy your reprieve.

05:34.644 --> 05:36.145
It won't last long.

05:36.146 --> 05:37.480
It was good seeing you, though,

05:37.481 --> 05:38.647
and your girlfriend.

05:38.648 --> 05:39.815
Partner.

05:39.816 --> 05:42.001
I'll bet.

05:43.003 --> 05:45.288
- I need a shower.
- Yeah.

05:46.874 --> 05:49.759
Hey, you stay on top
of that son of a bitch

05:49.760 --> 05:51.794
and don't let him
out of your sight.

05:51.795 --> 05:53.329
- Right.
- Go ahead.

05:54.381 --> 05:56.265

06:18.240 --> 06:20.282
I'm not going
to sugarcoat the situation.

06:20.528 --> 06:24.131
The release
of these prisoners is...

06:24.132 --> 06:28.068
It's not the finest day
for New York City.

06:28.069 --> 06:31.605
But remember, these problems
occurred long before my tenure.

06:31.606 --> 06:33.307
And as your mayor now,

06:33.308 --> 06:36.376
I intend to hold accountable
those responsible.

06:36.377 --> 06:38.629
The technician
whose sloppiness led

06:38.630 --> 06:40.430
to this disaster
has been dismissed,

06:40.431 --> 06:41.965
and other heads will roll.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.684
(reporters shouting)
MIGUEL: Mr. Mayor?

06:43.685 --> 06:45.853
How could there be
such lax oversight

06:45.854 --> 06:47.654
in the testing of DNA?

06:47.655 --> 06:50.123
Well, that's a question
best addressed

06:50.124 --> 06:52.226
to, uh, the councilwoman
who heads up

06:52.227 --> 06:54.027
the Committee for
Public Safety.

06:54.028 --> 06:55.595
That would be
Councilwoman Collins.

06:55.596 --> 06:58.432
Councilwoman Collins,
please answer that.

07:01.736 --> 07:04.338
Plain and simple,

07:04.339 --> 07:08.242
this city has seen a three-fold
increase in DNA testing

07:08.243 --> 07:10.377
in criminal prosecutions
in the past decade

07:10.378 --> 07:13.280
without a corresponding
increase in funding.

07:13.281 --> 07:15.749
The real problem is
our police department,

07:15.750 --> 07:16.884
which relies entirely

07:16.885 --> 07:19.419
too much on
DNA evidence,

07:19.420 --> 07:22.356
and strains our
city resources

07:22.357 --> 07:24.091
and the Medical
Examiner's Office.

07:24.092 --> 07:26.793
Whatever happened
to good old-fashioned

07:26.794 --> 07:29.329
policing, which
relies on hair,

07:29.330 --> 07:31.265
fibers, fingerprints--

07:31.266 --> 07:34.568
evidence in the purview
of your department's labs,

07:34.569 --> 07:36.770
Commissioner Reagan?

07:43.111 --> 07:46.079
I don't have a problem
with the buck stopping

07:46.080 --> 07:48.031
with the police commissioner,
Councilwoman.

07:48.032 --> 07:50.150
And rest assured
that I join you

07:50.151 --> 07:51.885
in making sure
this never happens again.

07:51.886 --> 07:53.186
Yeah,
but the fact remains,

07:53.187 --> 07:55.756
Commissioner, that extremely
dangerous criminals

07:55.757 --> 07:57.708
have been let loose
on the streets of New York City.

07:57.709 --> 08:01.161
Statements like that do create
a certain amount of heat,

08:01.162 --> 08:02.429
Miss Davidson,

08:02.430 --> 08:05.599
but the message I have
for the people of New York City

08:05.600 --> 08:08.886
is that the police department
will make sure

08:08.887 --> 08:11.271
that they remain safe.

08:14.976 --> 08:16.843
Police, ma'am. You okay?

08:16.844 --> 08:18.979
(WOMAN over intercom)
I'll be right there.

08:21.282 --> 08:23.150
Rosie Guiterrez?

08:23.151 --> 08:26.353
Yes. My former husband
is Mondo Guiterrez.

08:26.354 --> 08:29.656
They just let him out of prison
because his DNA test was bad.

08:29.657 --> 08:31.291
Yeah, we heard about him.

08:31.292 --> 08:33.876
He gets out and violates your
order of protection first thing.

08:33.878 --> 08:35.044
He was across the street

08:35.046 --> 08:36.630
all morning, just
standing there,

08:36.631 --> 08:38.799
watching the house
with that look.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.668
I'm afraid for myself, my son.

08:41.669 --> 08:43.904
Was he keeping
the legal distance, ma'am?

08:43.905 --> 08:45.005
Yeah.

08:45.006 --> 08:47.174
But he killed the man
I was seeing

08:47.175 --> 08:48.609
after we broke up.

08:48.610 --> 08:50.711
He has a violent temper.

08:50.712 --> 08:51.979
Before he went to jail, he said

08:51.980 --> 08:53.814
if he couldn't have me,
no one else could.

08:53.815 --> 08:56.350
- Is he here now?
- He left.

08:57.235 --> 08:58.752
Then there's nothing we can do.

08:58.753 --> 09:00.070
But if you do
see him again,

09:00.071 --> 09:02.556
do the same thing
you did before. Call 911,

09:02.557 --> 09:04.291
and we'll come back
to make sure you're okay.

09:04.292 --> 09:06.076
All right?

09:06.077 --> 09:07.427
Okay.

09:07.428 --> 09:08.595
No, no. I mean that.

09:08.596 --> 09:10.030
That's what we're here for.

09:10.031 --> 09:11.531
Okay.

09:14.585 --> 09:15.836
(sighs)

09:16.921 --> 09:18.622
I freaking hate
these bastards

09:18.623 --> 09:20.707
terrorizing their women,
roughing 'em up.

09:20.708 --> 09:22.342
And it's not just
East Harlem.

09:22.343 --> 09:24.628
It's the West Village,
the Upper East Side.

09:24.629 --> 09:26.146
They're a bunch of animals.

09:26.147 --> 09:28.298
(distant siren wailing)

09:29.884 --> 09:32.986
Rachel,
I need those evidentiary...

09:32.987 --> 09:34.287
I know you're running late, but

09:34.288 --> 09:35.922
I have a visitor for you.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.024
Becky Watalski?

09:37.025 --> 09:39.626
Becky's here?

09:39.627 --> 09:43.263
Is it a... Is it a bad time?

09:43.264 --> 09:45.132
No. No, not at all.

09:45.133 --> 09:47.067
I'm happy to see you.
Here, uh...

09:47.068 --> 09:49.069
Come in.

09:49.070 --> 09:51.071
Just sit down.

09:56.110 --> 09:59.279
I've decided to testify
against Richard Reed.

09:59.280 --> 10:02.416
Oh, Becky,
that is such great news.

10:02.417 --> 10:05.352
I saw his disgusting face on TV,

10:05.353 --> 10:08.355
and he was waving to people.

10:08.356 --> 10:10.490
I wasn't scared.

10:10.491 --> 10:13.894
It just made me so... sick.

10:13.895 --> 10:17.064
And... mad.

10:17.065 --> 10:19.733
And I thought about
what you said.

10:19.734 --> 10:23.437
I know you need my testimony.

10:23.438 --> 10:25.806
It will put him back in prison
for the rest

10:25.807 --> 10:27.841
of his life.
It better.

10:27.842 --> 10:29.242
And as a witness,

10:29.243 --> 10:31.378
you will have police protection
around the clock.

10:31.379 --> 10:33.547
They're already on Reed 24/7.

10:33.548 --> 10:35.949
No, you don't know what you're
dealing with with this guy.

10:35.950 --> 10:38.385
The police don't know how
he got into my apartment.

10:38.386 --> 10:39.886
Everything was locked.

10:39.887 --> 10:41.488
He can slip through keyholes.

10:41.489 --> 10:44.157
He's not gonna come anywhere
near you, Becky.

10:44.158 --> 10:47.060
I-I guess I just...

10:47.061 --> 10:49.229
I want him out of here.

10:50.631 --> 10:53.567
Five long years,
and all I have to do

10:53.568 --> 10:56.737
is close my eyes,
and I can see his twisted face.

10:56.738 --> 10:58.371
(footsteps approaching)

11:01.776 --> 11:04.010
Walk with me?

11:08.049 --> 11:10.717
ERIN: I'll present the case
to the grand jury immediately.

11:10.718 --> 11:12.685
An arrest warrant
will be issued.

11:12.686 --> 11:14.821
In the meantime,
I'll request a detail

11:14.822 --> 11:16.656
to provide you with
protection, okay?

11:16.657 --> 11:17.891
(phone rings)

11:17.892 --> 11:20.410
Sorry, it's my brother.
Do you mind?

11:20.411 --> 11:22.062
Hey, Danny. What's up?

11:22.063 --> 11:23.196
What?

11:23.197 --> 11:24.381
What-what
do you mean?

11:24.382 --> 11:25.632
(screams)

11:26.934 --> 11:29.169
- What's...(screaming)
- It's okay.

11:29.170 --> 11:31.171
Whoa! Scared me to death.

11:31.172 --> 11:32.872
Go upstairs, go upstairs.

11:32.873 --> 11:34.424
And the counselor.

11:35.476 --> 11:37.043
God, you look better than ever.

11:37.044 --> 11:38.411
What's she doing here?

11:38.412 --> 11:41.047
You bastard!

11:41.048 --> 11:42.983
Becky, Becky, Becky,
You-you...

11:42.984 --> 11:44.351
- Becky, Becky. -  Come on.
- Bastard!

11:44.352 --> 11:46.419
- You can do better than that. Remember?
- You bastard!

11:46.420 --> 11:48.054
You can do better than that?

11:48.055 --> 11:49.556
Oh, what?

11:49.557 --> 11:50.390
Spread your legs.

11:50.391 --> 11:52.075
REED:
What? What did I do?

11:52.076 --> 11:53.410
Witness intimidation.

11:53.411 --> 11:55.262
In-intimidation?
Yeah.

11:55.263 --> 11:56.596
<i>She</i> scared <i>me.</i>

11:56.597 --> 11:58.165
- Yeah?
- And she attacked me.

11:58.166 --> 12:00.000
But I'm not gonna press charges.

12:00.001 --> 12:02.002
Good. I am. Let's go.

12:04.906 --> 12:07.774
Don't you want
a lawyer?

12:07.775 --> 12:09.476
I don't need a lawyer.

12:09.477 --> 12:12.646
Hm. Intimidating
a witness.

12:12.647 --> 12:14.915
Or you must like it in the can.

12:14.916 --> 12:17.250
Prove to me
I knew she'd be down there.

12:17.251 --> 12:20.020
I don't have to prove
a damn thing to you.

12:20.021 --> 12:22.122
But I suppose
you want me to believe

12:22.123 --> 12:24.090
that it was
just a coincidence.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.659
My lucky day, frankly.

12:25.660 --> 12:26.860
Really?

12:26.861 --> 12:29.329
In fact, it's been
a very good week that way.

12:29.330 --> 12:30.831
I should buy
some lottery tickets.

12:30.832 --> 12:34.100
(chuckles) You really don't expect
a judge to believe you

12:34.101 --> 12:36.002
when we bring
you up, do you?

12:36.003 --> 12:37.537
Speaking of judge,

12:37.538 --> 12:39.272
that's why I was
on the sidewalk.

12:39.273 --> 12:40.640
Why is that?

12:40.641 --> 12:45.445
I wanted Judge Arliss
to come out and see me...

12:45.446 --> 12:48.281
free as a bird...

12:48.282 --> 12:50.584
eating a hot dog...

12:50.585 --> 12:54.821
after all those nasty things
he called me at my sentencing.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.391
You'll be back there
soon enough.

12:58.392 --> 13:00.427
I don't think so quite yet.

13:00.428 --> 13:02.929
Just ask that sister of yours--
what's her name?

13:02.930 --> 13:03.964
Uh...

13:03.965 --> 13:05.465
Erin.

13:05.466 --> 13:08.435
She owned
that courtroom.

13:10.538 --> 13:12.439
Easy, Detective.

13:12.440 --> 13:14.024
I'm just making small talk.

13:14.025 --> 13:16.109
Yeah.
I'm reformed.

13:16.110 --> 13:18.144
Dogs like you don't reform.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.146
They get locked up or put down.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.114
Is that a threat?

13:21.115 --> 13:22.666
No, I don't make threats.

13:26.370 --> 13:27.537
(sighs)

13:27.538 --> 13:29.122
Tell me something good.

13:29.123 --> 13:30.874
Well, I just
spoke to your sister.

13:30.875 --> 13:32.292
She said these charges
aren't gonna stick.

13:32.293 --> 13:33.593
- What do you mean?
- Yeah, she says he's gonna

13:33.594 --> 13:35.228
be out as soon as
he's arraigned.

13:35.229 --> 13:37.297
- No, no...
- We have to let him go.

13:37.298 --> 13:38.882
I'll deal with
my sister, okay?

13:38.883 --> 13:40.600
- Listen to me.
- Listen to <i>me.</i>

13:40.601 --> 13:42.719
I...
The guy is a violent sexual predator, okay?

13:42.720 --> 13:44.504
- He's not gonna stop.
- I agree with...

13:44.505 --> 13:46.506
I'll bust him for littering
if I have to, okay?

13:46.507 --> 13:49.476
Look, just give her a chance to
get a case against him, okay?

13:51.479 --> 13:52.812
I'm not happy
about this, either.

13:52.813 --> 13:55.015
(sighs)
Fine.

14:03.291 --> 14:05.492
You, sir...

14:07.695 --> 14:10.030
...are free to go.

14:14.869 --> 14:16.803
Good-bye.

14:21.375 --> 14:22.726
Toodle-oo.

14:22.727 --> 14:25.312
Shut up.

14:25.313 --> 14:26.446
(heavy sigh)

14:26.447 --> 14:27.897
Okay,

14:27.898 --> 14:31.384
she also said that Becky
decided she's not gonna testify.

14:32.186 --> 14:33.720
(slaps leg)
Great. Now what?

14:33.721 --> 14:35.555
That's Erin's case.

14:35.556 --> 14:37.257
He's gonna hurt someone.

14:37.258 --> 14:39.559
We won't let him.

14:46.789 --> 14:48.590
I mean, it's Son of Sam
all over again.

14:48.591 --> 14:50.581
You got a terrified
city here, Frank.

14:50.707 --> 14:52.041
It's national news.

14:52.042 --> 14:53.475
I'm aware, Mr. Mayor.

14:53.476 --> 14:56.111
These are messages from the
governor, the attorney general

14:56.112 --> 14:57.663
on down to block associations.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.015
The 911 system
is overtaxed.

15:00.016 --> 15:01.700
I mean, look what
happened to Abe Beame.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.168
They caught Son of Sam,

15:03.169 --> 15:05.054
and he still lost
the mayor's seat.

15:05.055 --> 15:06.622
Did you see
the paper today?

15:06.623 --> 15:08.224
All right?
"As each day passes

15:08.225 --> 15:10.626
"with serial killer
Dick Reed roaming free,

15:10.627 --> 15:12.261
"our current mayor's
reelection chances

15:12.262 --> 15:14.597
grow slimmer
and slimmer."

15:14.598 --> 15:16.098
Okay? I'm getting hammered

15:16.099 --> 15:19.101
for failing to protect
the city, Frank. Not you.
(sighs)

15:19.102 --> 15:20.102
Me.

15:20.103 --> 15:21.770
Son of Sam Task Force

15:21.771 --> 15:23.572
cost $90,000 per day.

15:23.573 --> 15:25.340
Today that would be $350,000.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.610
Uh, let's not go crazy, Frank.

15:27.611 --> 15:29.011
Well, if I need more resources,

15:29.012 --> 15:31.513
Mr. Mayor,
you will hear from me.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.148
You know,
that councilwoman,

15:33.149 --> 15:35.718
uh, Francine what's-her-name
at the press conference,

15:35.719 --> 15:37.319
I mean, she might as well
have just taken

15:37.320 --> 15:39.521
one of Dick Reed's hunting knives
and stuck you in the back.

15:39.522 --> 15:40.990
She's on a run for mayor.

15:40.991 --> 15:42.358
I mean, this committee,
that committee.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.293
I heard she's built up
a big war chest...

15:44.294 --> 15:45.861
I don't do politics.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.664
Oh, right, I forgot about that.
You're above all that.

15:48.665 --> 15:51.199
The longer this goes on, the worse
it's gonna be for me-- but that means

15:51.200 --> 15:52.968
it's gonna be
really bad for you.

15:52.969 --> 15:54.270
That's not my concern.

15:54.271 --> 15:55.671
My concern is protecting

15:55.672 --> 15:57.006
the citizens
of this city.

15:57.007 --> 15:59.475
You know, you said
you don't do politics, Frank.

15:59.476 --> 16:01.010
Maybe you should.

16:04.147 --> 16:05.914
(sighs)

16:17.193 --> 16:18.911
There you go, take two.

16:18.912 --> 16:21.864
Yeah, except
this time he's here.

16:21.865 --> 16:23.165
You Mondo Guiterrez?

16:23.166 --> 16:24.300
Yeah. So?

16:24.301 --> 16:25.400
You mind taking your hands

16:25.401 --> 16:27.236
out of your pockets?

16:27.237 --> 16:28.737
What are you doing here?

16:28.738 --> 16:30.306
What's it look like
I'm doing? Nothing.

16:30.307 --> 16:33.008
Yeah? Why don't you go
do nothing someplace else?

16:33.009 --> 16:34.476
Why don't you go
have another donut?

16:34.477 --> 16:35.761
- What did you say?
- Look, you're making

16:35.762 --> 16:37.012
your ex-wife very
uncomfortable with your

16:37.013 --> 16:39.415
presence here, okay?
I'm a legal distance.

16:39.416 --> 16:40.766
Mr. Guiterrez, there's
a lot of people

16:40.767 --> 16:42.584
that would like to see
you back in prison

16:42.585 --> 16:44.186
serving your time.
Yeah, I'm one of them.

16:44.187 --> 16:45.921
(scoffs)

16:45.922 --> 16:48.223
We're just waiting for
you to cross the line here.

16:48.224 --> 16:51.360
Look, I just want
to talk to her, man.

16:51.361 --> 16:53.195
She don't want to talk to you.

16:53.196 --> 16:54.263
I love her, man.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.264
We'd appreciate it

16:55.265 --> 16:56.498
if you'd love her from afar.

16:56.499 --> 16:57.433
Now, get moving.

16:57.434 --> 16:59.118
JAMIE:
Mr. Guiterrez,

16:59.119 --> 17:00.402
if you really love her,

17:00.403 --> 17:03.372
scaring her is a hell
of a way to show it.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.465
That's not bad, Harvard.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.952
It was a real
Dr. Phil moment.

17:28.531 --> 17:30.482
I just got the news.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.268
It's very nice of you
to stop by, Frank.

17:33.269 --> 17:35.170
The mayor needed
a fall guy.

17:35.171 --> 17:36.839
I'm sorry, Craig.

17:36.840 --> 17:41.210
I righted the ship
a long time ago, Frank.

17:42.545 --> 17:45.013
Eh, this office
is still overwhelmed.

17:45.014 --> 17:47.082
Are you gonna be okay?

17:48.785 --> 17:50.819
I'm gonna miss the pension.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.088
We own the house,

17:53.089 --> 17:55.457
Social Security,
Connie's still working.

17:55.458 --> 17:58.527
Craig, the city earmarked
an additional $12 million

17:58.528 --> 18:02.610
to help the Medical Examiner's office
deal with the backlog of DNA cases.

18:02.611 --> 18:04.479
(laughs) You know
as well as anyone, Frank,

18:04.540 --> 18:05.941
earmark doesn't
mean appropriated.

18:05.969 --> 18:07.069
What happened?

18:07.070 --> 18:09.271
Every time I went
before the committee,

18:09.272 --> 18:10.839
all I got was the runaround

18:10.840 --> 18:12.608
when I asked where
the rest of it went.

18:12.609 --> 18:15.010
Never saw
a dime of it, Frank.

18:16.780 --> 18:18.614
(over phone):
Anderson.

18:18.615 --> 18:20.149
What the hell is going on?

18:20.150 --> 18:22.401
I helped you out of a jam.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.186
I was only in that jam
because of you.

18:24.187 --> 18:27.356
How did you know what I told
the I.A. investigator?

18:28.792 --> 18:31.393
Huh? Did you get into the files?

18:31.394 --> 18:33.829
Did he tell you?
Is he part of it?

18:35.865 --> 18:37.466
Are you part of it?

18:39.302 --> 18:41.837
We're all part of it.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.706
Part of what? The Blue Templar?

19:04.794 --> 19:07.663
How come nobody's talking?

19:08.865 --> 19:12.601
Well, sweetheart, sometimes
adults have a lot on their mind.

19:12.602 --> 19:14.069
Like what?

19:14.070 --> 19:15.962
It's those guys who got
out of prison, right, Mom?

19:15.963 --> 19:17.864
That would
be it, honey.

19:18.541 --> 19:22.644
It's like sitting on a powder keg,
all this waiting around.

19:22.645 --> 19:25.380
You know when you guys have got,
like, a bully at school?

19:25.381 --> 19:27.082
You know he's gonna
do something bad,

19:27.083 --> 19:29.051
you just don't know when--
kind of like that.

19:29.052 --> 19:31.086
Yeah, and you can't arrest them
for something they <i>might</i> do.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.105
Have done, will do again.

19:33.106 --> 19:34.389
Oh, yeah, definitely will.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.325
I mean,
isn't there some other case

19:36.326 --> 19:38.093
we can stick on
this guy Reed?

19:38.094 --> 19:39.928
- The serial killer?
- Yeah.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.598
- There's a beast for the record books.
- You got that right.

19:42.599 --> 19:43.599
Erin,

19:43.600 --> 19:45.901
you got to hop to
and knock some sense

19:45.902 --> 19:47.402
into this
Watalski woman.

19:47.403 --> 19:49.104
Get her to testify
against this monster.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.173
Don't you think that's
what I'm trying to do?

19:51.174 --> 19:52.658
The kids at school
think it's Grandpa's fault

19:52.659 --> 19:54.209
there's a serial killer
on the loose.

19:54.210 --> 19:55.544
Serial killer?

19:55.545 --> 19:57.412
Whoa, whoa,
nobody's on the loose, okay?

19:57.413 --> 19:58.680
And it's not your
grandfather's fault.

19:58.681 --> 20:01.183
I'll discipline my own
daughter, thank you.

20:01.184 --> 20:03.619
He set three women on fire,
but he tortured them first.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.187
Mom, he set
them on fire?

20:05.188 --> 20:07.306
Okay, you know, guys...

20:10.560 --> 20:12.828
That happened a long time ago.

20:12.829 --> 20:14.396
It's not gonna happen again.

20:14.397 --> 20:16.532
JAMIE:
What's the plan?

20:16.533 --> 20:19.134
Just watching him 24/7
for the rest of his life?

20:19.135 --> 20:22.504
Our office will make this case
even if Becky doesn't testify.

20:22.505 --> 20:24.907
Before he sets someone else
on fire, I hope.

20:24.908 --> 20:27.142
I won't have this talk
at my table.

20:28.211 --> 20:30.078
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

20:30.079 --> 20:33.248
You didn't do anything, Sean.

20:36.686 --> 20:40.489
We get 52 of these dinners
each year.

20:40.490 --> 20:43.325
Let's enjoy the rest
of this one.

20:57.073 --> 21:00.275
So, how about those Jets?

21:03.246 --> 21:06.582
I'm not sure your old man
handled that too well.

21:06.583 --> 21:09.818
This has us all on edge.

21:09.819 --> 21:11.687
Your pedophile gonna walk?

21:11.688 --> 21:15.023
I've got 48 hours before
Garth Kraver's set free.

21:15.024 --> 21:18.226
I'm looking into involuntary
civil commitment in line with

21:18.227 --> 21:20.829
the new Mental
Hygiene Law.

21:20.830 --> 21:22.230
What does that mean in English?

21:22.231 --> 21:25.050
It means if I can get two
shrinks to say he's nuts,

21:25.051 --> 21:26.468
I can have him locked up.

21:26.469 --> 21:28.604
Wow, that's very
un-P.C. of you, sis.

21:28.605 --> 21:29.738
I mean, you're walking

21:29.739 --> 21:32.464
a really gray area there
with the civil rights, don't you think?

21:32.465 --> 21:34.288
I've got my own thin
blue line, Danny.

21:34.377 --> 21:35.510
You're getting creative;

21:35.511 --> 21:37.613
- I like it.
- Trying.

21:37.614 --> 21:38.981
(phone ringing)

21:41.250 --> 21:43.352
Yeah.

21:43.353 --> 21:44.686
What?

21:44.687 --> 21:46.421
I'm on my way.

21:46.422 --> 21:48.790
Something up?
Yeah, I got a 10-8 on a woman

21:48.791 --> 21:50.742
in Columbus Park,
same M.O. as Dick Reed.

21:50.743 --> 21:53.028
I'll keep
you posted.

21:56.332 --> 21:58.367
JACKIE:
Here she comes.

21:58.368 --> 22:00.535
(indistinct radio transmission)

22:01.671 --> 22:03.705
JACKIE:
Fits the pattern,

22:03.706 --> 22:05.007
plus the knots on her bindings

22:05.008 --> 22:06.625
are very similar
to that of Reed's.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.126
No, but it can't be him, though.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.744
Gerken's been sitting
on the mother's house.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.380
He says Reed's been
holed up since yesterday.

22:11.381 --> 22:13.248
I don't know. Well, what about
the slashes on her face?

22:13.249 --> 22:15.617
Not the same.
I've seen Reed's work up close.

22:15.618 --> 22:17.252
His slashes are deep, violent.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.637
Those are different.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.389
Besides, this girl
wasn't even raped.

22:20.390 --> 22:22.257
So, what do you think, copycat?

22:22.258 --> 22:24.159
Yeah, maybe one
of his crazy fans.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.028
When Reed got off
the prison bus,

22:26.029 --> 22:27.429
you notice him carrying
a duffel bag

22:27.430 --> 22:29.531
or a box or anything?
No.

22:29.532 --> 22:31.333
I mean, if he got fan mail
in the joint,

22:31.334 --> 22:33.135
left it behind,
where do you think it would be?

22:33.136 --> 22:34.436
It'd still be there.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.905
Yeah, still be there.

22:36.906 --> 22:38.707
Two points, Reagan, okay.

22:38.708 --> 22:41.126
Hey, sometimes,
cool heads do prevail.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.627
Cool heads?

22:42.628 --> 22:44.212
What? You?

23:14.043 --> 23:16.011
♪ ♪

23:47.076 --> 23:49.244
(sighs)

23:54.317 --> 23:57.319
Here's the material
you requested, Commissioner.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.421
Put it on the table.

24:04.710 --> 24:06.995
The Appropriations
Committee minutes.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.665
Politicians can do
a lot of talking.

24:10.666 --> 24:13.602
Yeah, seems so, sir.

24:13.603 --> 24:16.805
(sighs)

24:18.207 --> 24:19.241
Sit down, Baker.

24:19.242 --> 24:22.077
- We got a lot of work to do.
- Yep.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.850
DANNY:

24:28.851 --> 24:30.418
"got what they deserved.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.189
Yeah.
Whoever wrote this

24:34.190 --> 24:37.058
Ah. Wait. I think
I got something here.

24:37.059 --> 24:39.161
Uh, it's, uh,
Hugh Stayton.

24:39.162 --> 24:44.299
He has a record for forgery,
and for selling fake letters

24:44.300 --> 24:46.368
from John Wayne
Gacy online.

24:46.369 --> 24:47.953
Lovely.

24:47.954 --> 24:50.105
Serial killer fan-boy.

24:50.106 --> 24:53.241
Yeah, and in his
letter, which is here,

24:53.242 --> 24:56.478
he, uh, talks
about his Web site

24:56.479 --> 24:58.647
that he created
with a James Ratchet,

24:58.648 --> 25:01.466
of LuckyStabbyKnife.com.

25:03.386 --> 25:06.855
Oh. Fabulous.

25:06.856 --> 25:10.392
Hey, click on that link
right there-- new material.

25:10.393 --> 25:12.494
Hold on.

25:12.495 --> 25:14.563
Those two guys right there--
those are the guys

25:14.564 --> 25:16.798
who were at the bus stop
waiting for Dick Reed.
Yeah.

25:16.799 --> 25:20.735
What do you say we go visit
Mr. Lucky Flabby Knife?
Yeah.

25:25.208 --> 25:26.408
Yeah?

25:26.409 --> 25:28.960
Police. We'd like
to come inside.

25:28.961 --> 25:32.497
Very interesting taste in art.
Thank you.

25:32.498 --> 25:33.849
Can you turn on a light?

25:33.850 --> 25:35.350
I like it dark.

25:35.351 --> 25:36.551
DANNY:
Okay, wise guy.

25:36.552 --> 25:38.753
Hey, Jackie,
let some light in here.

25:38.754 --> 25:41.089
A woman was assaulted in
Columbus Park last night.

25:41.090 --> 25:42.257
You have anything
to do with it?

25:42.258 --> 25:43.592
STAYTON: Come on. Daylight
fades paper goods.

25:43.593 --> 25:44.676
Hey, hey, hey.

25:44.677 --> 25:47.896
Sit down and answer
my question.

25:47.897 --> 25:49.064
No.

25:49.065 --> 25:50.465
I'm a collector.

25:50.466 --> 25:51.650
That's my thing.

25:51.651 --> 25:54.069
I don't like actually
touching people.

25:54.070 --> 25:55.971
Well, you're gonna get used
to being touched in prison.

25:55.972 --> 25:58.006
- Who does your decorating, kid?
- I do.

25:58.007 --> 26:00.342
What's this
LuckyStabbyKnife.com?

26:00.343 --> 26:01.843
It's my Web site.
Mm-hmm.

26:01.844 --> 26:03.645
It's not a crime.
It's ironic.

26:03.646 --> 26:04.916
Or moronic.

26:04.941 --> 26:06.541
Where were you between 5:00
and 7:00 p.m. last night?

26:06.582 --> 26:08.950
Right here.
You can check the computer.

26:08.951 --> 26:10.485
I was on a suicide
chat room all night.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.721
That's fantastic.
A suicide chat room.

26:12.722 --> 26:14.923
People don't get me,
and that's okay.

26:14.924 --> 26:16.675
Whatever. So, someone could have
been on your computer

26:16.676 --> 26:18.994
while you were at that park
with your lucky stabby knife.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.528
It wasn't me.

26:20.529 --> 26:21.630
Maybe it was you.

26:21.631 --> 26:23.531
What, Dick Reed
put you up to it?

26:23.532 --> 26:25.100
You and your buddy
James Ratchet?

26:25.101 --> 26:26.835
- No.
- Oh, you trying to impress him?

26:26.836 --> 26:29.871
Want to get your own face
on one of these bad-ass posters?

26:29.872 --> 26:31.373
Danny?

26:31.374 --> 26:32.741
That's our vic.

26:35.378 --> 26:37.946
(Danny sighs)

26:37.947 --> 26:39.314
- Looks like you were there.
- No.

26:39.315 --> 26:40.782
- Get on your feet.
- No, no, no!

26:40.783 --> 26:42.083
Get on your
feet, fan-boy.

26:42.084 --> 26:43.401
- No, no. It wasn't me!
- Cuff him. Cuff him.

26:43.402 --> 26:44.736
It wasn't me.
Shut up!

26:44.737 --> 26:45.687
It was Ratchet!

26:45.688 --> 26:47.539
I was just
posting the photos.

26:47.540 --> 26:48.540
Can you prove it?

26:48.541 --> 26:50.575
Look, he's really into Reed.

26:50.576 --> 26:52.527
He would do anything
to please him.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.829
Me-- I just think
he's really scary.

26:54.830 --> 26:56.531
Really?

26:56.532 --> 26:59.601
I mean, the stuff he was
talking about last night...

26:59.602 --> 27:02.036
What, you saw Dick Reed,
last night?

27:02.037 --> 27:03.338
Where?

27:03.339 --> 27:05.373
At some dive bar in Flushing.

27:06.809 --> 27:08.843
(sighs)
Get his statement.

27:08.844 --> 27:11.947
And get a description of
James Ratchet out over the air.

27:15.718 --> 27:17.352
(tires squeal)

27:17.353 --> 27:19.404
GERKEN:
He's got to be in there.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.773
We didn't take our eyes off
the house, front or back.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.491
Forget the mother.
She's catatonic.

27:24.994 --> 27:28.363
(TV playing indistinctly)

27:33.269 --> 27:35.120
Ma'am?

27:35.121 --> 27:36.738
Ma'am?

27:36.739 --> 27:40.074
Ma'am, we're gonna need
to talk to you.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.446
(woman crying)

27:55.941 --> 27:57.925
Jackie!

27:57.926 --> 28:00.395
Call an ambulance!

28:00.396 --> 28:02.314
You okay?
Yeah.

28:02.315 --> 28:03.431
Huh?
Yeah.

28:03.432 --> 28:05.266
Dick Reed do this to you?

28:05.267 --> 28:06.434
He's my brother.

28:06.435 --> 28:08.269
Your brother did this to you?

28:08.270 --> 28:10.338
DANNY: Huh?
Yeah.

28:10.339 --> 28:12.307
Do you know
where he is?

28:12.308 --> 28:14.609
He lives in the basement.

28:14.610 --> 28:15.910
Okay, okay,

28:15.911 --> 28:17.846
okay, okay.
I know what this looks like,

28:17.847 --> 28:19.464
but he's normally
really nice to me.

28:19.465 --> 28:21.416
It's just that
he's really upset with me.

28:21.417 --> 28:22.417
Okay, take it off.

28:22.418 --> 28:23.635
I said something
I shouldn't have.

28:47.610 --> 28:49.778
(door creaking)

28:55.317 --> 28:57.985
Oh, son of a bitch.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.654
What's going on?
Where's Reed?

28:59.655 --> 29:02.540
He's got a tunnel. He went
out through a tunnel.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.726
What?

29:06.045 --> 29:08.380
Damn it!

29:12.137 --> 29:13.820
One. I asked you
to do one thing.

29:13.821 --> 29:16.004
- To watch that guy like a hawk.
- That's what I was doing.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.856
- No, you weren't doing it!
- How was I supposed

29:17.856 --> 29:19.123
to know he had a secret...?
It's your job!

29:19.124 --> 29:20.574
JACKIE:
Danny?

29:22.411 --> 29:23.911
I'm not done with you.

29:25.797 --> 29:27.648
The tunnel leads to the
neighbor's storm cellar.

29:27.649 --> 29:29.050
It was a bomb
shelter built back

29:29.051 --> 29:30.718
in the '50s, but
no sign of Reed.

29:30.719 --> 29:32.336
Becky Watalski.

29:32.337 --> 29:33.888
We got to get
to Becky Watalski

29:33.889 --> 29:36.173
before this creep Reed gets to her.
Yeah.

29:39.594 --> 29:42.847
Councilwoman Collins,
thanks for coming.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.432
Is this about
the other day?

29:44.433 --> 29:45.599
Politics, Frank.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.368
I didn't think you
were that thin-skinned.

29:47.369 --> 29:50.538
Actually, I took
what you said to heart.

29:50.539 --> 29:51.689
What's that?

29:51.690 --> 29:55.776
About doing a little
old-fashioned police work.

29:55.777 --> 29:57.611
Why don't you sit down?

29:57.612 --> 29:58.812
I'm very busy.

29:58.813 --> 30:00.548
As are we all.

30:04.419 --> 30:07.054
See,

30:07.055 --> 30:08.489
here's the thing.

30:08.490 --> 30:11.492
We all remember
that horrible misunderstanding

30:11.493 --> 30:12.860
when you were investigated

30:12.861 --> 30:15.329
for awarding public contracts
without bids.

30:15.330 --> 30:17.231
Old news.
I was exonerated.

30:17.232 --> 30:19.834
You were exonerated,
I know, but see,

30:19.835 --> 30:21.869
that started me thinking.

30:21.870 --> 30:23.704
Why come at me

30:23.705 --> 30:25.940
so hard
at the press conference?

30:25.941 --> 30:28.142
Rightly or wrongly,
it's all going to end up

30:28.143 --> 30:29.777
in the police commissioner's
lap anyway.

30:29.778 --> 30:32.613
So, I paid
the medical examiner a visit.

30:32.614 --> 30:34.081
Good friend,

30:34.082 --> 30:36.217
by the way.

30:36.218 --> 30:38.753
Did you know he lost his job
and his pension?

30:38.754 --> 30:40.421
(BAKER  clears throat)
Sir.

30:40.422 --> 30:41.956
Oh, I'm sorry, Baker.

30:41.957 --> 30:44.024
I didn't mean
to leave you out.

30:44.025 --> 30:46.527
Detective Baker put a lot
of time in on this.

30:46.528 --> 30:49.263
Funds earmarked for
the Medical Examiner's Office,

30:49.264 --> 30:52.166
a $79,000 shortfall,
corresponding to

30:52.167 --> 30:54.368
a trip you took
to the Dominican Republic.

30:54.369 --> 30:56.904
A $49,000 shortfall
to the M.E.'s office

30:56.905 --> 30:59.106
the following month.
I don't have
to listen to this.

30:59.107 --> 31:02.276
You don't have to,
but you may want to.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.778
Now,

31:03.779 --> 31:08.182
misappropriation of public funds
is a serious problem.

31:08.183 --> 31:11.051
There's more,
and when we're finished,

31:11.052 --> 31:13.888
you may want to lawyer up.

31:18.894 --> 31:21.462
(dog barking)

31:24.666 --> 31:26.867
(metallic rattling)

31:44.352 --> 31:46.454
(footsteps approaching)

31:47.322 --> 31:49.490
(doorknob rattling, Becky gasps)

31:59.201 --> 32:01.535

using this kid as a decoy,

he's got some other target,

35:06.321 --> 35:07.521
Well, he's already had plenty

35:07.522 --> 35:08.889
of opportunity there, didn't he?

35:08.890 --> 35:10.024
Yeah, I know that.

35:10.025 --> 35:11.158
