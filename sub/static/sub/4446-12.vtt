00:01.872 --> 00:04.574
Anybody else worried about
Mr. Sunshine out there?

00:04.608 --> 00:06.376
<i>I know. He's looking worse.</i>

00:13.551 --> 00:14.317
What are you?

00:18.055 --> 00:19.622
Why didn't it attack you?

00:19.924 --> 00:22.525
You don't want to eat me.
What do you want?

00:23.060 --> 00:25.662
I am not one of the resurrected.

00:26.163 --> 00:27.697
I'm your messiah.

00:46.884 --> 00:48.985
Do you think we'll ever see them again?

00:49.019 --> 00:50.553
Mack and Addy?

00:51.522 --> 00:53.389
My heart says yes.

00:53.858 --> 00:55.658
But my mind?

00:56.060 --> 00:57.861
My mind says no.

00:59.163 --> 01:02.232
I was kinda hoping they'd make
it with us to the promise land.

01:33.931 --> 01:35.098
Now what?

01:35.132 --> 01:36.733
Heads up, everybody.

01:37.902 --> 01:39.135
I hate roadblocks.

01:39.169 --> 01:41.271
Can't you just push that
thing out of our way?

01:41.305 --> 01:44.107
No thanks. I'd like to hold onto <i> this</i> truck.

01:54.151 --> 01:56.786
Well this golf course has seen better days.

02:02.626 --> 02:04.460
This is so sad.

02:04.495 --> 02:05.962
I learned to play in prison.

02:05.996 --> 02:07.330
Always wondered what it'd be like

02:07.364 --> 02:09.431
to hang out with the
real country club types.

02:19.543 --> 02:21.878
Think that bridge is gonna hold this truck?

02:22.413 --> 02:24.480
Better test it first.

02:36.727 --> 02:38.528
Looks pretty solid.

02:42.266 --> 02:43.733
<i>Hello, Delta-Xray.</i>

02:43.767 --> 02:47.203
<i>Citizen Z calling all cars,</i>
<i>calling all cars.</i>

02:47.237 --> 02:49.172
Delta-Xray back at you.

02:49.540 --> 02:51.407
Hello, good to hear from you again.

02:51.442 --> 02:52.675
It's been days, and I worry.

02:53.043 --> 02:54.043
Thanks, mom.

02:54.078 --> 02:56.779
Any news on Mack or Addy?

02:57.548 --> 02:59.115
No, nothing yet.

02:59.750 --> 03:03.319
Maybe they're just off the
grid and can't make contact.

03:04.054 --> 03:05.088
Maybe.

03:05.122 --> 03:06.656
<i>How's Murphy?</i>

03:07.024 --> 03:08.591
Murphy is pissed.

03:08.626 --> 03:11.728
Where the hell is that lab
you keep talking about?

03:11.829 --> 03:14.197
And have you found that witch
doctor that almost killed me?

03:14.231 --> 03:14.797
Doctor Merch?

03:15.165 --> 03:16.265
I'm still working on that.

03:16.367 --> 03:18.368
And you call yourself the NSA?

03:18.402 --> 03:20.403
Quit looking at porn and find that quack.

03:20.437 --> 03:22.171
<i>We got business to settle.</i>

03:22.206 --> 03:24.374
Such a nice guy.

03:29.880 --> 03:30.780
Uh oh.

03:33.083 --> 03:34.817
I got the one on the right.

03:39.023 --> 03:40.690
Two thousand, four hundred fifty-five.

03:44.328 --> 03:45.628
I'm out of ammo.

03:45.663 --> 03:46.462
Me too.

03:47.398 --> 03:48.598
Look. Some clubs.

03:49.299 --> 03:50.633
Not the putter.

03:51.502 --> 03:54.137
Remember keep your left arm straight.

03:57.107 --> 03:58.574
Let's run for the clubhouse!

04:10.254 --> 04:11.387
Murphy?

04:12.890 --> 04:14.357
He's out there somewhere.

04:14.391 --> 04:15.558
Safer than us.

04:16.860 --> 04:17.959
We got company.

04:24.702 --> 04:26.402
Hard to swing in here!

04:27.571 --> 04:28.838
10K, your sling!

04:28.872 --> 04:29.739
Yeah.

04:33.744 --> 04:34.243
<i>Too many.</i>

04:34.278 --> 04:35.478
<i>This way!</i>

04:46.890 --> 04:49.058
Door won't hold much longer!

04:49.093 --> 04:50.693
Better in here than out there!

04:55.733 --> 04:57.033
Gunfire?

05:00.504 --> 05:02.071
<i>You can come out now.</i>

05:02.406 --> 05:03.973
That was not Murphy.

05:04.341 --> 05:06.542
It wasn't a Z either.

05:07.377 --> 05:09.045
All right, get ready.

05:20.390 --> 05:21.090
It's okay.

05:23.026 --> 05:24.527
It's all clear.

05:26.563 --> 05:27.563
Nice timing.

05:27.731 --> 05:28.731
Don't get too relaxed.

05:28.766 --> 05:30.233
There's still more outside.

05:30.267 --> 05:32.502
We got another guy outside too.

05:34.605 --> 05:35.872
I don't believe it.

05:40.377 --> 05:41.377
Oh!

05:41.411 --> 05:43.379
Kid out of nowhere.

05:43.413 --> 05:45.782
Final holes of the Open Championship

05:45.816 --> 05:49.452
at historic Saint Andrews, home of golf.

05:53.891 --> 05:56.692
He's gonna hit a knock-down seven.

06:01.365 --> 06:04.000
Oh, he got all of that!

06:04.902 --> 06:06.169
Sorry!

06:09.640 --> 06:10.306
What?

06:10.741 --> 06:12.141
Little risky, don't you think?

06:12.743 --> 06:14.977
No. The Zs love me.

06:16.113 --> 06:17.413
Who the hell are you?

06:17.447 --> 06:18.948
Brett Zimmerman.

06:18.982 --> 06:20.750
This is Henry and Janice.

06:20.784 --> 06:22.051
Roberta Warren.

06:22.085 --> 06:24.954
This is Doc, 10K, Cassandra, and

06:24.988 --> 06:28.891
the fool with the jacket golfing
with the zombies, that's Murphy.

06:29.226 --> 06:32.829
You're just jealous cuz
they like me more than you.

06:38.902 --> 06:40.970
Even though it's really not the season,

06:41.305 --> 06:44.640
it was the night before Sunday
and all through the dome,

06:44.675 --> 06:46.475
not a creature was stirring

06:46.510 --> 06:47.910
in spite of this poem.

06:48.278 --> 06:51.914
So on Blingo, on Hotbot, go Yahoo and Kayak.

06:51.949 --> 06:55.051
Search Google and Info and also NextBio.

06:55.085 --> 06:58.087
Find Marilyn Merch.

06:58.455 --> 06:59.856
Where have you gone?

07:00.190 --> 07:02.692
Did you make it to California?

07:02.926 --> 07:05.161
Or do you walk among the dead?

07:16.640 --> 07:18.207
Thirsty?

07:20.777 --> 07:22.912
I have been since Portsmouth.

07:25.115 --> 07:27.483
Prison? Massachusetts?

07:28.819 --> 07:29.552
Christ.

07:29.586 --> 07:31.087
I'm an alum.

07:31.121 --> 07:32.722
Another ex-con.

07:33.190 --> 07:34.724
Not you?

07:34.758 --> 07:38.394
I taught junior high english
before everything went to hell.

07:38.428 --> 07:42.899
But Henry was in San Carlos,
drug smuggling I think.

07:42.933 --> 07:46.035
Hmmm, my kinda guy.

07:48.138 --> 07:49.472
Your evaluation?

07:50.407 --> 07:54.410
I never saw anything like it.
The Zs seemed afraid of him.

07:54.444 --> 07:56.679
But we saw what we saw.

07:57.381 --> 07:59.682
Talent like that could come in handy.

08:11.028 --> 08:14.764
Yeah, and let's not be stingy with that.
There you go.

08:17.401 --> 08:18.868
<i>Got any ID?</i>

08:18.902 --> 08:22.104
Mmmm. Oh yeah,
this is not that White Lightning crap.

08:22.139 --> 08:24.073
Have a taste, 10 cent.

08:25.342 --> 08:26.809
<i>Miss Warren...</i>

08:27.644 --> 08:28.744
Roberta.

08:29.179 --> 08:31.781
Roberta, would you like to propose a toast?

08:33.450 --> 08:34.549
Sure.

08:35.619 --> 08:36.852
To absent friends.

08:37.554 --> 08:39.188
To absent friends.

08:39.890 --> 08:41.190
Mr. Murphy.

08:41.224 --> 08:43.726
You seem to have a special way with them.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.796
Brother,
you don't know the half of it.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.097
Come on, Murphy.

08:48.332 --> 08:50.599
No one wants to hear your war stories.

08:50.634 --> 08:51.767
They asked.

08:52.102 --> 08:53.970
I'd like to hear it.

09:00.677 --> 09:01.911
Those look like zombie bites.

09:01.945 --> 09:02.945
Eight of 'em.

09:02.980 --> 09:04.780
And I lived to tell the tale.

09:04.815 --> 09:05.982
How is that possible?

09:06.016 --> 09:08.951
Well I was given an experimental vaccine,

09:08.986 --> 09:11.487
and now the Zs think I'm one of them.

09:11.521 --> 09:13.456
Is there more of this vaccine?

09:14.124 --> 09:16.726
You're looking at it. Only known survivor.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.628
But if we can get to this lab in California,

09:19.663 --> 09:22.465
they can make more vaccine using
the antibodies in my blood.

09:22.499 --> 09:26.569
And the human race survives. Ta-da.

09:26.903 --> 09:28.504
Our friend tends to exaggerate.

09:28.538 --> 09:29.372
<i>Come on.</i>

09:29.406 --> 09:31.841
We all saw him walk through zombies.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.776
What can I say? I'm a natural.

09:34.144 --> 09:36.045
Try unnatural.

09:36.146 --> 09:39.348
Somebody had a cocktail.

09:39.516 --> 09:44.320
Henry?
Don't forget about our friend Doc outside.

09:44.354 --> 09:47.723
So his lab in California,
that's a long ways.

09:47.758 --> 09:49.325
We started in New York.

09:49.359 --> 09:50.359
New York?

09:50.727 --> 09:52.161
You came from New York?

09:52.195 --> 09:53.262
Wasn't easy.

09:53.296 --> 09:54.930
That is an understatement.

09:54.965 --> 09:56.999
Well we were headed west.

09:57.034 --> 10:00.169
Maybe we can help get
you the rest of the way.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.408
We could use the help.

10:05.442 --> 10:07.376
Let me propose another toast.

10:08.412 --> 10:10.012
To California.

10:12.516 --> 10:13.849
Yeah.

10:14.217 --> 10:15.017
To California.

10:15.052 --> 10:16.419
To California.

10:29.166 --> 10:30.199
Steady your aim?

10:30.567 --> 10:33.936
Oh, well maybe just a sip.

10:37.207 --> 10:39.909
Hey, tell my buddy 10K it's
his turn to take watch.

10:52.489 --> 10:53.756
Oooh, wow.

10:55.358 --> 10:57.126
That last sip,

10:57.994 --> 10:59.862
I must be tired than I thought.

11:06.036 --> 11:07.970
Hey.

11:13.143 --> 11:14.844
What's happening?

11:25.088 --> 11:27.223
♪ Have mercy... ♪

Uhhh.

11:54.784 --> 11:56.785
Okay, everybody hold on.

11:56.820 --> 11:58.020
Not a great option right now.

11:58.054 --> 11:58.954
Where's Murphy?

11:58.989 --> 11:59.922
Murphy!

11:59.956 --> 12:01.557
Murphy!

12:24.981 --> 12:25.781
Okay.

12:25.815 --> 12:28.150
Anyone see anything sharp?

12:29.319 --> 12:31.720
Well there's all these
golf tees on the floor.

12:32.355 --> 12:33.622
Too short.

12:37.494 --> 12:41.030
Well I got something under here.
It's in my... 10K, get it.

12:41.631 --> 12:43.799
- You got it?
- Ummm.

12:43.833 --> 12:45.834
Oh, no that's not sharp enough.

12:45.869 --> 12:47.636
<i>Okay, uh.</i>

12:47.671 --> 12:49.238
Uh, oh look.

12:49.272 --> 12:51.574
There's something on top of the bar.

12:52.909 --> 12:54.376
Any time!

12:54.411 --> 12:55.211
Okay.

12:56.213 --> 12:57.713
Ready? On three.

12:58.114 --> 12:58.547
One!

12:58.915 --> 12:59.315
Two!

12:59.683 --> 13:00.115
Three!

13:06.923 --> 13:08.324
Okay.

13:08.358 --> 13:10.626
Now...

13:10.660 --> 13:12.461
How do we get out of these?

13:12.495 --> 13:14.029
Can we bust that rail?

13:14.064 --> 13:17.499
Well if we can't,
it ain't gonna be for lack of tryin'.

13:22.973 --> 13:24.740
If you say anything golf-related,

13:25.442 --> 13:27.443
I'll poke you with it.

13:36.253 --> 13:37.753
Where are you taking me?

13:37.787 --> 13:41.557
Just sit back and appreciate
your improved circumstances.

13:41.925 --> 13:43.892
I'm sorry. How is this an improvement

13:44.127 --> 13:46.629
We have food, water, fuel.

13:47.163 --> 13:49.164
You and your friends had no food, no water,

13:49.199 --> 13:50.733
and were running on fumes.

13:50.767 --> 13:55.971
And no ammo. Should be thankful
we freed you from those losers.

13:56.673 --> 13:59.008
Well maybe losing the feelings in my hands

13:59.042 --> 14:01.110
is making me a little cranky.

14:01.578 --> 14:03.912
I mean are these really necessary?

14:06.716 --> 14:07.449
Look.

14:07.484 --> 14:08.684
I get it.

14:08.718 --> 14:11.553
You heard me talking about my
deal and decided to horn in.

14:11.588 --> 14:13.289
Figured there might be
something in it for you

14:13.323 --> 14:15.457
if you get me to California.

14:15.492 --> 14:19.561
But guys,
unless the sun decided to rise in the west

14:19.596 --> 14:21.997
we're headed the wrong way.
California's behind us.

14:22.032 --> 14:24.099
We're not going to California.

14:26.269 --> 14:27.870
What the hell do you want?

14:28.305 --> 14:31.140
Why don't you just relax, enjoy the scenery?

14:31.174 --> 14:32.608
I already seen it.

14:32.642 --> 14:34.743
Then just try shutting up.

14:34.778 --> 14:36.378
Not my nature.

14:36.413 --> 14:38.380
Then evolve.

14:38.581 --> 14:41.016
You'll find out what we want soon enough.

14:41.584 --> 14:43.352
What'd you do to the others?

14:44.054 --> 14:46.221
You know they won't just let you take me.

14:46.256 --> 14:48.524
They're a lot more dangerous than they look.

14:48.558 --> 14:51.226
You don't have to worry about them anymore.

14:51.261 --> 14:53.095
What'd you do?

14:53.129 --> 14:54.730
You kill them?

14:54.764 --> 14:56.732
We left them for the Zs.

14:56.766 --> 14:58.901
Darwin will take care of the rest.

15:04.374 --> 15:05.474
What happened to us?

15:05.508 --> 15:08.077
I believe we got roofed

15:08.178 --> 15:09.678
Drugged with Rohypnol.

15:09.713 --> 15:11.413
Where's Murphy?

15:11.448 --> 15:13.148
The others are gone too.

15:13.850 --> 15:15.150
You don't think...

15:17.153 --> 15:18.854
Murphy wouldn't do that.

15:18.888 --> 15:20.055
Drug us to escape?

15:20.090 --> 15:24.326
How could we let this happen?
He was our responsibility.

15:25.595 --> 15:27.296
At least they left our ride.

15:33.203 --> 15:34.570
The battery's dead.

15:34.604 --> 15:37.706
Well assuming we find some way to get moving,
what next, boss?

15:37.807 --> 15:41.577
Go after Murphy and get his ass
to California or die tryin'.

15:44.748 --> 15:46.749
Hey,
do we even know what direction he went in?

15:46.850 --> 15:49.551
Too many questions, Doc. Too many questions.

15:50.286 --> 15:52.821
It's got a battery. I don't know how good.

15:58.553 --> 15:59.653
Lo at this.

15:59.687 --> 16:00.554
Yes.

16:00.588 --> 16:01.822
How did you know that?

16:01.856 --> 16:03.690
Saw the antenna on the back.

16:08.096 --> 16:08.795
I'm here.

16:09.130 --> 16:09.997
I'm here.

16:10.832 --> 16:12.032
We lost Murphy.

16:12.066 --> 16:13.367
Holy crap.

16:13.735 --> 16:17.037
That has the potential for great,
permanent tragedy.

16:17.071 --> 16:19.272
We think he may have been
kidnapped by three civilians,

16:19.372 --> 16:20.406
motive unknown.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.675
But they are aware Murphy's status.

16:22.676 --> 16:26.112
Is he still alive?
Do you know if Murphy is still alive?

16:26.847 --> 16:27.947
As far as we know.

16:28.582 --> 16:31.651
Well he disappeared this morning,
probably on I-70

16:31.685 --> 16:34.320
going east to west in a brown utility truck

16:40.527 --> 16:43.329
Okay, ummm.

16:43.364 --> 16:46.599
I see one vehicle on I-70 going
east through your location about

16:46.633 --> 16:47.667
two hours ago.

16:47.701 --> 16:48.701
Okay, uh...

16:48.736 --> 16:50.737
That... that's got to be them.

16:50.771 --> 16:53.473
Hello? Hello?

16:53.507 --> 16:54.140
Ugh.

16:54.641 --> 16:55.541
Damn apocalypse.

16:55.943 --> 16:57.343
Damn apocalypse.

17:10.424 --> 17:12.458
Hey! Where we can see you.

17:12.626 --> 17:14.160
I got a bashful bladder.

17:14.194 --> 17:16.896
Don't mistake me for somebody who cares!

17:22.102 --> 17:24.503
Well, hello there.

17:26.006 --> 17:29.909
Citizen Z,
are you as good as you think you are?

17:31.345 --> 17:32.678
Mr. Murphy!

17:32.713 --> 17:33.913
Get over here.

17:34.181 --> 17:37.283
Just shaking the dew off the lily!

17:38.085 --> 17:39.819
There you are, Murphy.

17:39.853 --> 17:41.788
Classy as ever.

17:41.822 --> 17:43.956
Warren was right. You've been kidnapped.

18:01.255 --> 18:03.656
So you were <i> what </i> before the apocalypse?

18:04.725 --> 18:06.192
I worked security.

18:06.293 --> 18:09.629
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I was getting that vibe.

18:10.230 --> 18:14.067
Oh, so what?
Military, Special Ops, Navy Seal?

18:14.601 --> 18:15.401
Shut up!

18:34.421 --> 18:36.556
Well here we go again,
another fork in the road.

18:36.590 --> 18:39.025
Hard to tell which way they went.

18:41.962 --> 18:45.732
Citizen Z, this is Delta-Xray. Copy.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.535
Hello?

18:50.504 --> 18:53.539
I'd say flip a coin, but who's got coins?

18:59.913 --> 19:01.380
Hey, check that out.

19:12.392 --> 19:14.560
Well maybe it's a message from our guy.

19:14.895 --> 19:17.697
Come on. Come on. It means go right!

19:17.731 --> 19:19.031
Go right!

19:20.501 --> 19:22.869
Yeah. He's saying they went that way.

19:24.138 --> 19:26.005
Yeah. Let's roll.

19:28.208 --> 19:28.908
Yes!

19:39.386 --> 19:42.255
So General,
wanna tell me what the hell we're doing?

19:42.456 --> 19:44.991
Six miles from here, up and over that peak,

19:45.025 --> 19:48.227
is the Mesa Pharmaceutical
Storage and Transfer Facility.

19:48.996 --> 19:50.196
Stunning news.

19:50.230 --> 19:53.499
And after that,
can we please oh please go to Disneyland?

19:53.534 --> 19:56.102
Mesa is the Fort Knox of
the Zombie Apocalypse.

19:56.136 --> 19:57.937
It's filled with unused pharmaceuticals,

19:57.971 --> 19:59.772
mostly oxycontin Mr. Murphy,

19:59.807 --> 20:01.974
you know the value of drugs in this world.

20:02.009 --> 20:04.777
You can trade them for anything.
They're money.

20:04.815 --> 20:09.210
So you want to liberate some
oxycontin from Mesa. Be my guest.

20:09.310 --> 20:10.577
It's full of Zs.

20:10.612 --> 20:11.478
<i>Dozens</i>

20:11.512 --> 20:13.947
Some of them are hopped up on speed.

20:13.982 --> 20:17.317
So Mr. Murphy,
you do your walk through zombies trick,

20:17.352 --> 20:19.953
open the gates for us, and when we ride out

20:20.788 --> 20:21.989
you're a free man.

20:23.958 --> 20:27.394
Well why didn't you just say so earlier?
I love oxycontin.

20:27.762 --> 20:29.363
Why do we have to go on foot?

20:29.397 --> 20:31.798
Meth zombies are extremely
responsive to sound.

20:31.833 --> 20:33.834
So we can only sneak up if we're walking.

20:33.868 --> 20:35.302
And I want this road blocked

20:35.336 --> 20:38.372
so some other vehicle doesn't
drive in and set off the Zs.

20:38.406 --> 20:39.072
Henry.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.474
Give me a hand with the truck.

20:40.508 --> 20:43.143
I don't want it tampered
with while we're gone.

21:12.073 --> 21:13.140
A new low.

21:14.609 --> 21:16.009
Did you say something?

21:24.719 --> 21:25.819
What?

21:27.422 --> 21:28.555
Nothing.

21:35.296 --> 21:36.196
Science project?

21:37.465 --> 21:38.331
Insurance policy.

21:39.300 --> 21:41.802
We have to leave this
truck here for a while.

21:42.070 --> 21:43.970
I want it to be here when we get back.

21:44.138 --> 21:46.473
You just can't trust anybody these days.

21:47.308 --> 21:48.241
Copy that.

21:53.181 --> 21:54.481
It's Zero Hour.

22:02.156 --> 22:04.357
I see you're wearing a wedding ring.

22:04.525 --> 22:05.592
Your husband?

22:07.662 --> 22:08.862
Among the lost.

22:10.732 --> 22:13.266
The Zs got him last time we tried this.

22:13.301 --> 22:15.335
You guys tried robbing this oxy before?

22:15.937 --> 22:17.404
A month ago.

22:17.438 --> 22:20.107
He and Zimmerman cooked up the whole idea.

22:21.843 --> 22:23.276
What was his name?

22:24.345 --> 22:25.612
Jason.

22:26.647 --> 22:28.115
How long were you guys married?

22:28.683 --> 22:30.083
Five years.

22:30.184 --> 22:31.184
He was a cop.

22:31.319 --> 22:32.719
Knock off the questions, Murphy.

22:32.754 --> 22:34.521
This isn't Match.com.

22:35.456 --> 22:36.957
<i>Hold up a minute.</i>

22:37.892 --> 22:40.060
I'm gonna scout up ahead. Henry!

22:40.695 --> 22:41.895
Keep an eye out.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.598
We'll be expecting Zs soon.

22:46.534 --> 22:47.934
That must be tough.

22:49.070 --> 22:53.073
Your husband dead while a
wannabe like Zimmerman lives.

22:53.307 --> 22:55.275
Jason knew the risks.

22:55.977 --> 22:58.311
Still,
it worked out pretty well for Zimmerman.

22:58.980 --> 23:00.547
What are you saying?

23:01.215 --> 23:02.082
Nothing.

23:02.683 --> 23:04.918
Just your husband gets
to walk among the dead

23:04.952 --> 23:06.219
and Zimmerman gets you.

23:07.555 --> 23:09.189
Shut up.

23:11.159 --> 23:11.958
Sorry.

23:12.493 --> 23:14.661
I'm just a chatty Kathy.

23:14.829 --> 23:17.264
I didn't mean anything.

24:17.789 --> 24:18.589
You hear that?

24:18.623 --> 24:19.957
That sounded like a gunshot.

24:20.158 --> 24:21.125
Sure did.

24:26.798 --> 24:28.165
Let's be careful.

24:28.667 --> 24:29.934
Hey, hey! Give me that!

24:30.302 --> 24:30.868
Let go.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.641
What the hell is going on here?
Who fired that shot?

24:37.676 --> 24:39.777
He went for her gun and it went off.

24:40.779 --> 24:41.812
Is that true?

24:43.048 --> 24:44.048
No.

24:45.283 --> 24:47.117
It was an accident.
I was reloading and it just went off.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.787
I was just trying to be helpful,
and this idiot tackles me.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.021
All right, ll of you.

24:51.356 --> 24:54.232
Knock off the bullshit and
pull yourselves together.

24:54.332 --> 24:58.336
The Mesa plant is just just ahead.
We need to get going before it's dark.

25:14.932 --> 25:16.233
Looks like they left their truck.

25:16.267 --> 25:18.302
And we're gonna do the same.

25:43.695 --> 25:44.961
Something wrong?

25:44.996 --> 25:45.929
Always.

25:50.902 --> 25:52.502
Keep moving.

26:07.885 --> 26:09.686
Two thousand, five hundred fifty-two.

26:09.721 --> 26:11.021
Thanks for the warning.

26:11.589 --> 26:13.023
You're welcome.

26:13.257 --> 26:14.758
They know we're coming now.

26:14.792 --> 26:16.093
Let's go.

26:21.844 --> 26:24.212
Come on operation Bitemark.

26:24.246 --> 26:25.480
Give me a wave.

26:25.915 --> 26:28.450
Send up a flare. Shoot me a text.

26:29.151 --> 26:32.287
Crop circles.
Anything to let me know you're still alive.

26:36.525 --> 26:38.693
Results for Marilyn Merch.

26:38.728 --> 26:40.562
Okay, okay, we can do something useful.

26:43.899 --> 26:46.901
So Dr. Merch,
where were you when that was captured?

26:48.137 --> 26:49.637
Three months ago?

26:50.673 --> 26:52.207
Colorado?

26:52.241 --> 26:54.342
What's in Colorado?

26:59.348 --> 27:02.050
Well what are we gonna do when we find him?

27:02.418 --> 27:03.518
Hey, check this out.

27:07.590 --> 27:09.257
You think he left it on purpose?

27:09.291 --> 27:10.024
He must have.

27:10.059 --> 27:11.826
He definitely didn't go willingly.

27:12.194 --> 27:13.528
We better step it up.

27:13.562 --> 27:15.663
I knew she was gonna say that.

27:20.403 --> 27:21.836
Damn it.

27:24.407 --> 27:25.807
Stop. Everyone.

27:26.041 --> 27:27.642
About time.

27:27.877 --> 27:28.510
Don't worry.

27:29.378 --> 27:31.413
Our target is just over this ridge.

27:32.381 --> 27:34.349
And your troubles will soon bever.

27:35.518 --> 27:37.719
I don't like the way he said that.

27:52.835 --> 27:53.968
You want something?

28:09.318 --> 28:12.086
Henry, check the perimeter.
I don't want any surprises.

28:12.188 --> 28:13.354
You.

28:13.556 --> 28:14.989
Over here with me.

28:15.991 --> 28:18.827
Why does everybody think
they can boss me around?

28:30.639 --> 28:32.874
They look even faster than last time.

28:38.414 --> 28:40.048
You want me to walk through those?

28:40.082 --> 28:42.517
They're like the Usain Bolts of zombies.

28:42.551 --> 28:43.785
What are they on? Meth?

28:43.819 --> 28:45.887
Actually ritalin. They love the stuff.

28:45.921 --> 28:46.821
Great.

28:46.856 --> 28:49.023
Just what the world needs, ADHD zombies.

28:49.058 --> 28:51.025
We tried a frontal assault and it failed,

28:51.060 --> 28:52.193
got Janice's husband killed.

28:52.228 --> 28:55.296
But you should be able to
walk right through all the Zs.

28:55.331 --> 28:56.931
Oh yeah. You make it sound so easy.

28:56.966 --> 28:58.466
I never said it was easy.

28:58.501 --> 28:59.601
Just possible.

28:59.635 --> 29:01.202
Look here, soldier of misfortune.

29:01.237 --> 29:02.937
You may not care if I get killed,

29:02.972 --> 29:05.440
but I'll bet the rest of humanity does.

29:06.509 --> 29:08.109
There's no way I'm doing this.

29:09.144 --> 29:11.779
I don't care about you
or the rest of humanity.

29:15.718 --> 29:17.218
Son of a bitch.

29:17.253 --> 29:18.586
You bit me.

29:19.221 --> 29:21.055
I ought to shoot you right now.

29:21.624 --> 29:22.657
But you won't.

29:23.659 --> 29:24.592
God.

29:24.627 --> 29:25.894
I see him.

29:27.329 --> 29:28.429
<i>Jason!</i>

29:29.698 --> 29:30.899
It's Jason.

29:34.270 --> 29:36.037
You knew he might be here.

29:36.071 --> 29:37.572
I'm trying not to think about it.

29:37.606 --> 29:39.474
But now it's happening,
and all I can think is

29:39.508 --> 29:40.808
you're the one that got him killed.

29:40.843 --> 29:43.444
Why don't you think about
how I saved your life?

29:43.913 --> 29:44.946
What's it gonna be?

29:46.916 --> 29:48.283
Let's do this.

29:48.717 --> 29:50.685
I've got some place to be.

30:11.807 --> 30:12.874
What is it?

30:14.310 --> 30:16.177
Looks like some kind of warehouse.

30:16.211 --> 30:17.645
Damn. Those are fast Zs.

30:20.182 --> 30:21.849
You think that's where they're at?

30:22.017 --> 30:22.817
Must be.

30:24.286 --> 30:26.387
Yeah, some kind of manufacturing plant.

30:30.926 --> 30:33.061
Mesa Pharmaceuticals.

30:34.396 --> 30:36.497
Oh, the Zs are all over this place.

30:40.202 --> 30:41.369
What's so funny?

30:42.438 --> 30:43.304
See for yourself.

30:47.977 --> 30:48.977
Oooh.

30:49.878 --> 30:51.012
Uh-uh.

30:51.480 --> 30:52.213
What is it?

30:53.015 --> 30:53.748
Uh.

30:59.455 --> 31:00.388
Wow.

31:00.689 --> 31:02.156
What are you looking at?

31:04.460 --> 31:05.727
Apparently

31:05.761 --> 31:08.162
the Zs got into the pharmaceuticals.

31:08.664 --> 31:10.565
Some of them are on speed,

31:10.599 --> 31:13.935
but it looks like more than a
few of them got into the viagra.

31:16.171 --> 31:18.239
I had no idea that was even possible.

31:18.273 --> 31:20.642
Kid, it's official.

31:20.676 --> 31:23.344
You have now seen it all.

31:30.472 --> 31:31.272
It's all clear.

31:31.306 --> 31:34.241
Good. Murphy, this is your moment.

31:36.569 --> 31:39.337
Zimmerman, it looks like these Zs Are happy to see you.

31:39.672 --> 31:40.872
Shut up.

31:41.307 --> 31:42.841
Here's the plan.

31:43.209 --> 31:45.877
Head for the first door past the corner.
It'll be unlocked.

31:45.911 --> 31:48.380
Go inside and immediately
turn to your right.

31:48.414 --> 31:50.782
You'll see a power panel inside a cage.
Open it.

31:50.816 --> 31:52.684
Turn on the main generator.

31:52.718 --> 31:55.453
Door, right, cage, generator. Anything else?

31:55.488 --> 31:56.554
Once the lights are on,

31:56.589 --> 31:58.556
proceed directly across
the room in front of you,

31:58.591 --> 32:01.026
taking the right hand door
into the storage area.

32:01.060 --> 32:02.861
All right. Should I be writing this down?

32:02.895 --> 32:05.063
It'll all be obvious once you see it.

32:05.097 --> 32:05.730
All right.

32:05.765 --> 32:07.465
Okay, anything else?

32:07.500 --> 32:10.035
Could I get you a chai
latté while I'm in there?

32:10.069 --> 32:12.404
Get serious. Your life depends on it.

32:13.339 --> 32:15.974
Once you're inside the staging area,
you'll see an office

32:16.008 --> 32:18.877
up a flight of stairs.
That is inventory control.

32:18.911 --> 32:21.646
Go inside, look for an alarm bell.
Set it off.

32:21.681 --> 32:24.883
That'll draw the Zs away from
the gate so we can get inside.

32:24.917 --> 32:27.106
Then bring me the keys to the van.
They'll be...

32:27.206 --> 32:28.106
Jason!

32:31.477 --> 32:32.444
Jason's gone.

32:44.581 --> 32:48.232
That must be hurt. Seeing him like this

32:48.332 --> 32:51.724
and living with the man responsible.

33:06.772 --> 33:08.106
Not just yet.

33:09.341 --> 33:11.309
Ready when you are, General.

33:17.616 --> 33:19.484
What are you waiting for? Go!

34:10.034 --> 34:12.837
It's only a matter of time
until I know everything, so

34:12.871 --> 34:16.507
you might as well just tell me now.
There are no secrets,

34:16.542 --> 34:17.542
not from me.

34:20.980 --> 34:22.780
Okay, Doctor Merch.

34:22.815 --> 34:24.215
Why all the mystery?

34:25.384 --> 34:27.385
You're the whiz kid genetic recombiner,

34:27.418 --> 34:29.754
like a shot out of Harvard.

34:29.788 --> 34:33.757
Your gene splicing methods
made miracles possible.

34:33.792 --> 34:36.027
Then two years before the apocalypse,

34:36.061 --> 34:37.195
you disappear.

34:37.496 --> 34:38.795
Vanish.

34:39.297 --> 34:40.565
Fall down a well.

34:40.599 --> 34:43.568
Until three years after the shit goes down,

34:44.402 --> 34:47.205
you resurface at the Portsmouth
emergency infection lab,

34:48.107 --> 34:51.585
injecting prisoners with
experimental vaccines.

34:56.924 --> 34:58.625
Unauthorized request.

34:59.093 --> 35:01.928
Requested identification
not available at this time.

35:01.963 --> 35:04.965
Apparently they don't know
who they're dealing with.

35:13.441 --> 35:15.709
What in the hell is Murphy doing down there?

35:15.743 --> 35:17.978
The Zs must think he's one of them.

35:18.012 --> 35:20.246
That must be why Zimmerman
and the others kidnapped him,

35:20.281 --> 35:22.048
so they can get to the drugs.

35:22.083 --> 35:24.517
Now I like drugs as much as the next guy,

35:24.552 --> 35:27.320
but there ain't enough dope
in the world that's gonna make

35:27.355 --> 35:31.358
me want to be out there walkin'
around with them viagra Zs.

35:31.592 --> 35:32.692
Let's go.

36:03.087 --> 36:06.523
To the right. To the right.

36:09.627 --> 36:10.894
And cage.

36:14.042 --> 36:15.242
Slow ones.

36:15.276 --> 36:17.945
Never thought I'd be happy to see you guys.

36:23.151 --> 36:24.318
Okay.

36:25.386 --> 36:27.421
Main power. Main power.

36:29.057 --> 36:30.023
Main power. Main...

36:33.461 --> 36:36.763
Well thank you.
I believe I will try that one.

36:41.502 --> 36:42.836
Okay.

36:43.204 --> 36:44.638
Step two.

37:18.773 --> 37:21.441
Now that's the ticket.

37:59.714 --> 38:04.651
NSA.org.

38:09.057 --> 38:09.990
Come in.

38:10.024 --> 38:11.525
Come in, Northern Light.

38:11.826 --> 38:13.593
Come in, Northern Light.

38:14.028 --> 38:15.996
This is Murphy for Citizen Z.

38:16.998 --> 38:18.365
Where are you,

38:18.399 --> 38:20.000
you useless bastard.

38:20.768 --> 38:22.569
Come in, Northern Light.

38:24.405 --> 38:25.272
You're alive.

38:26.307 --> 38:28.141
Yeah, no thanks to you.

38:28.176 --> 38:29.943
Look. I don't have time to chit chat.

38:29.978 --> 38:31.878
I'm in the middle of a situation here.

38:31.913 --> 38:33.513
Have you found Doctor Merch?

38:33.548 --> 38:36.516
And what's going on with
this lab in California?

38:36.551 --> 38:38.352
I still don't have a location for Merch.

38:38.386 --> 38:39.720
Last contact I have on record,

38:39.754 --> 38:41.788
she was en route to California by way of

38:41.823 --> 38:44.958
Fort Collins, Colorado.
The trail goes dark after that.

38:44.993 --> 38:46.026
Why there?

38:46.294 --> 38:47.361
I'm not clear.

38:47.395 --> 38:49.596
Her transport landed at a military base,

38:49.630 --> 38:51.999
maybe to refuel,
maybe to pick up more passengers.

38:52.033 --> 38:53.133
I don't know.

38:53.167 --> 38:55.602
There's nothing conclusive,
but I am still digging.

38:55.837 --> 38:57.738
Just find her.

39:00.641 --> 39:01.908
Look at all this.

39:02.377 --> 39:04.311
Beautiful, man. You did it.

39:06.914 --> 39:07.914
Find the oxy.

39:07.949 --> 39:10.050
Get it into the van.

39:11.619 --> 39:14.388
Murphy! Get down here!
The job's not done yet!

39:14.422 --> 39:17.090
<i>And bring the keys to the van!</i>

39:17.125 --> 39:18.992
Duty calls.

39:39.714 --> 39:41.181
I'm comin'.

39:41.215 --> 39:44.317
Get over here and help.
Things will go faster.

39:44.352 --> 39:46.586
I am not your stock boy.

39:46.621 --> 39:48.088
I don't have time for this.

39:48.122 --> 39:49.322
Drop it!

39:50.391 --> 39:52.192
Not happening, Warren.
You need to turn around

39:52.226 --> 39:54.461
and get out of here before
I kill your big ticket.

39:54.495 --> 39:56.163
Then how will you get out of here?

39:56.197 --> 39:57.230
We can drive.

39:57.598 --> 39:59.366
Don't know what you folks will do.

41:07.631 --> 41:08.864
Well

41:08.899 --> 41:12.501
now that that's over,
we're right back where we started.

41:15.495 --> 41:16.995
Actually this is totally different.

41:24.304 --> 41:25.637
You're weak, Zimmerman.

41:26.773 --> 41:28.073
You're a weak little man.

41:30.743 --> 41:31.944
Should we stop them?

41:32.812 --> 41:35.113
Only if he points that gun at Murphy.

41:35.215 --> 41:37.482
You were gonna kill me and the others.

41:38.685 --> 41:39.685
Pathetic.

41:40.620 --> 41:42.254
It's the apocalypse.

41:43.022 --> 41:45.657
The apocalypse is better off without you.

41:45.859 --> 41:47.159
Murphy, what are you doing?

41:47.193 --> 41:47.626
<i>Me?</i>

41:48.962 --> 41:50.095
Nothing.

41:53.366 --> 41:54.600
Murphy.

41:56.135 --> 41:57.302
What?

42:07.914 --> 42:09.147
Mercy granted.

42:09.349 --> 42:11.516
I'm not sure that was necessary.

42:24.931 --> 42:25.931
Go!
