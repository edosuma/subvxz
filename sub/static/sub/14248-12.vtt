WEBVTT

00:03.212 --> 00:06.711
Captain's log, stardate 48734.2.

00:06.882 --> 00:11.343
Sometimes it's a good idea to get away
from being a captain for a while.

00:11.512 --> 00:17.265
So I'm participating in a new holonovel.
The setting is ancient England.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.313
The drawing room is in here.

00:26.610 --> 00:31.521
Bridget, take Mrs Davenport's cape
and tell Lord Burleigh she's here.

00:31.698 --> 00:36.159
- There's tea.
- That would be lovely. Thank you.

00:37.955 --> 00:41.739
Tea is usually served
at 5:30 and dinner's at 8:30.

00:41.917 --> 00:45.582
His lordship doesn't appreciate
being kept waiting.

00:45.754 --> 00:48.589
I'll be sure to be prompt.

00:52.553 --> 00:56.135
Let's make something clear,
Mrs Davenport.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.889
My job is to make sure
that this household runs smoothly.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.140
I have been with Lord Burleigh
for nearly 20 years

01:03.188 --> 01:06.106
because this household runs smoothly.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.940
He has come to trust me

01:09.111 --> 01:13.571
and I will not brook any behaviour
that might jeopardise that trust.

01:13.740 --> 01:17.785
So you will be expected to follow
the rules I have set down.

01:18.704 --> 01:25.157
Mrs Templeton, I have no wish to do
anything to disrupt this household.

01:25.335 --> 01:29.463
But let me make something
perfectly clear.

01:29.631 --> 01:36.595
I have been hired by Lord Burleigh.
It's his orders I will follow, not yours.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.305
You would be wise
not to make an enemy of me.

01:42.477 --> 01:46.724
I can make sure we have
another governess by next week.

01:46.899 --> 01:50.650
I suggest we try to get along,
Mrs Templeton.

01:50.235 --> 01:53.153
Surely there's room here for both of us.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.116
One lump or two?

02:02.497 --> 02:04.786
Two, please.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.211
Lord Burleigh will be here directly.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:04.101 --> 03:09.950
- Forgive me. I've startled you.
- I'm sorry. I didn't hear you come in.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.604
Mrs Davenport, I'll come to the point.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.769
I am not an easy man to live with.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.532
Since my wife died,
I'm told I'm even worse.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.410
- She was a buffer for me.
- I understand.

03:24.580 --> 03:27.497
The children are the ones
who've suffered.

03:27.666 --> 03:31.367
I've not been much of a father
and I can't be a mother.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.456
I'm not asking you to be a mother,

03:35.632 --> 03:38.669
but they'll respond
to a woman's sensibilities.

03:38.844 --> 03:43.553
- You might fill a void in their lives.
- I'll certainly try, your grace.

03:44.391 --> 03:49.433
Young Henry is sometimes stubborn
and little Beatrice misses her mother.

03:50.314 --> 03:53.398
I hope they won't
make things difficult for you.

03:55.944 --> 03:58.862
One thing, above all, I must demand.

03:59.865 --> 04:05.286
Never, under any circumstances,
go onto the fourth floor. Is that clear?

04:06.288 --> 04:09.408
- Bridge to Captain Janeway.
- Go ahead, Mr Kim.

04:09.583 --> 04:13.663
Commander Chakotay and Mr Tuvok's
shuttlecraft is on sensors,

04:13.837 --> 04:18.998
but they're not responding to our hails.
The shuttle's been badly damaged.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.460
- Lifesigns?
- Two, but they're very faint.

04:22.221 --> 04:25.471
Beam them to sickbay
as soon as they're in range.

04:25.641 --> 04:27.847
Aye, Captain.

04:34.274 --> 04:39.269
They've taken a blast to the head by
an energy discharge. Cardiostimulator.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.482
Mr Tuvok has concussion,
but I can handle it.

04:42.658 --> 04:47.236
The bio-neural energy has been
extracted from the Commander's brain.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.488
Extracted?

04:49.665 --> 04:54.374
Someone drained the energy from
every axon right down to the synapses.

04:54.545 --> 04:58.542
I can keep him breathing,
but there's nothing else I can do.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.541
He's braindead.

06:55.415 --> 06:59.164
The attack lasted seconds,
but was effective.

06:59.336 --> 07:03.915
- We are fortunate to be alive.
- What happened, Lieutenant?

07:04.910 --> 07:08.338
We completed our trade mission
and were on course to rendezvous

07:08.512 --> 07:11.217
when we encountered
a dark-matter nebula.

07:11.390 --> 07:16.550
As we began a routine analysis, an
unidentified ship attacked our shuttle.

07:16.728 --> 07:21.686
- Any idea why?
- They would not respond to our hails.

07:21.859 --> 07:26.651
We were hit by an energy discharge
which penetrated our shields.

07:26.822 --> 07:30.273
Commander Chakotay
lost consciousness immediately

07:30.450 --> 07:34.116
and I had barely activated
the autopilot before I was overcome.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.909
And the alien ship?

07:37.820 --> 07:40.914
The last image I saw was the ship
flying back into the nebula,

07:41.860 --> 07:43.921
but the details are difficult to remember.

07:44.890 --> 07:46.924
Can you tell me about
the energy discharge?

07:47.920 --> 07:50.259
Its modulation or phase distribution?

07:50.429 --> 07:52.801
There wasn't time for analysis.

07:52.973 --> 07:57.184
However, the shuttle's sensors
may have recorded information.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.428
I will download the sensor logs.

07:59.605 --> 08:03.305
Why would someone want to extract
his bio-neural energy?

08:03.483 --> 08:07.184
I don't know, but if I'm to have
any hope of reviving him,

08:07.362 --> 08:10.280
I must know how his neurons
were depleted.

08:10.449 --> 08:14.149
It would be a great help
if I could examine the weapon.

08:14.328 --> 08:17.744
We're going back to find
the ship that attacked you.

08:17.915 --> 08:20.619
Janeway to bridge.
Prepare a new course.

08:20.792 --> 08:25.668
Mr Tuvok will provide the coordinates.
We'll keep you posted, Doctor.

08:38.644 --> 08:41.929
The energy discharge
overloaded the computer.

08:42.105 --> 08:46.518
- All sensor data have been erased.
- Torres is in sickbay.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.860
Tell her
to go over those damaged sensor logs

08:50.300 --> 08:53.197
to see if she can reconstruct
any of the data.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.490
This makes it more difficult.

08:55.661 --> 08:59.528
I've been using long-range
sensors to analyse the nebula.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.873
It's sending out
electromagnetic radiation.

09:03.430 --> 09:05.664
We won't be able to scan inside it.

09:07.256 --> 09:11.467
You know, it sounds to me
like a perfect hiding place.

09:11.635 --> 09:15.336
- I agree.
- I don't like the idea of going in blind.

09:15.514 --> 09:19.512
I'll reconfigure the sensors
to a multiphasic bandwidth.

09:20.936 --> 09:25.812
- Is there a problem?
- I've lost all contact with the nebula.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.148
I don't understand.

09:29.319 --> 09:32.439
Wait a minute. We've altered course.
Mr Paris?

09:33.323 --> 09:36.750
Our new heading is 121, mark 6.

09:36.243 --> 09:40.371
We've completely come about,
Captain, but it wasn't me.

09:40.539 --> 09:44.750
Check the navigational computer.
Who ordered the course change?

09:44.918 --> 09:48.868
According to this, the command
was issued from the conn.

09:50.424 --> 09:56.470
It wasn't me. The helm controls are
working perfectly. No malfunctions.

09:57.180 --> 10:00.763
Transfer control to your station
and reset our course.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.262
Course laid in.

10:03.437 --> 10:07.648
Mr Paris, I want you to run
a full diagnostic on the conn station.

10:07.816 --> 10:11.517
- See if you can isolate the problem.
- Aye, Captain.

10:32.925 --> 10:37.385
You might have asked before adorning
my sickbay with animal remains.

10:37.554 --> 10:42.970
It's a medicine wheel,
a talisman used by Chakotay's tribe.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.517
He once... showed me how it works.

10:46.855 --> 10:50.935
If anything happened to him,
I was to perform a healing ritual.

10:51.902 --> 10:56.778
The wheel represents both the universe
outside and inside our minds.

10:56.949 --> 11:00.115
They believe each is a reflection
of the other.

11:01.328 --> 11:05.290
When a person is sleeping,
or on a vision quest,

11:05.207 --> 11:08.327
it's said that his soul
is walking the wheel.

11:08.502 --> 11:14.836
But if he's in a coma or near death,
it means that he's gotten lost.

11:15.801 --> 11:19.501
These stones are signposts...

11:20.931 --> 11:23.173
...to help point the way back.

11:27.229 --> 11:31.855
Not exactly standard
medical procedure, I know, but...

11:32.250 --> 11:37.102
You've placed the Coyote Stone at the
crossroads of the fifth and sixth realms,

11:37.281 --> 11:41.528
which would divert the commander's
soul, his consciousness,

11:41.702 --> 11:46.529
into the Mountains of the Antelope
Women, an extremely attractive locale.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.114
He might not want to leave.

11:49.293 --> 11:51.332
How do you know about this?

11:51.503 --> 11:57.707
It's my business to know treatments,
including psycho-spiritual beliefs.

11:57.885 --> 12:02.511
Unfortunately, in this case,
the medicine wheel won't be much help.

12:02.681 --> 12:06.382
There's just not enough
of his mind left to work with.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.150
Find your way home, Commander.

12:42.513 --> 12:44.552
Hello?

12:54.691 --> 12:57.776
Is someone here?

13:16.213 --> 13:22.216
It's like sensing some kind of presence,
as if someone else were here.

13:25.970 --> 13:27.504
Your telepathic senses again.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.265
Is this like last week
when you went into sickbay

13:32.437 --> 13:37.514
and you knew Lieutenant Hargrove had
been there, only he'd left hours before?

13:37.693 --> 13:40.397
It's not the same. That was like...

13:41.822 --> 13:45.736
...like hearing faint music
from a faraway place.

13:47.786 --> 13:50.324
When I was in my quarters just now...

13:51.456 --> 13:55.703
...it was almost tangible.
I felt like someone was in the room.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.000
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

13:59.840 --> 14:03.900
A presence. That's all I can say.

14:03.260 --> 14:06.759
Warp engines
still within normal parameters.

14:08.390 --> 14:11.973
We just changed course again.
Mr Kim?

14:12.144 --> 14:15.844
- Our new heading is 121 mark 6.
- Get us back on course.

14:18.660 --> 14:21.981
The helm's not responding.
I'm locked out.

14:33.749 --> 14:36.999
- The command station was blocked.
- From where?

14:37.169 --> 14:41.630
Lockout originated on Deck 12,
Section B7, navigational control.

14:41.798 --> 14:45.200
See if you can re-establish control.

14:45.177 --> 14:48.877
I checked every ODN junction
and I can't find a problem.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.760
It seems
we've developed a new problem.

14:51.934 --> 14:55.766
- Helm control re-established.
- Get us back to the nebula.

14:55.938 --> 14:59.638
Janeway to Torres.
Who's in the navigational control?

14:59.816 --> 15:02.580
No one. I was there this morning

15:02.236 --> 15:05.710
and Lieutenant Paris
was there a few minutes ago.

15:05.239 --> 15:08.690
- That's not true.
- Are you certain, B'Elanna?

15:08.867 --> 15:11.702
Positive.
I saw him leave five minutes ago.

15:12.746 --> 15:16.744
Janeway out. Explanation, Mr Paris.

15:17.834 --> 15:22.295
I passed by on my way back
from the Jefferies tube, but that's all.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.900
Am I being accused of something?

15:27.261 --> 15:30.630
We are following
a line of deductive reasoning.

15:30.806 --> 15:35.432
Both deviations were issued from
locations where you were working.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.272
I'm telling you, I didn't do it!

15:38.438 --> 15:42.306
Well, I'm willing
to rule out mutiny for the time being.

15:42.484 --> 15:48.107
I believe you, but there is the possibility
you are having memory problems.

15:48.282 --> 15:51.947
Go down to sickbay.
Have the doctor check you out.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.740
- All right.
- Lieutenant Durst.

16:10.721 --> 16:15.217
Neurotransmitters at normal.
Synaptic functions stable.

16:15.392 --> 16:19.930
Hold still.
This is an extremely sensitive scan.

16:20.439 --> 16:23.523
What I wouldn't give to see
good old Doc Brown.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.732
- What?
- Doc Brown.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.979
Lollipops in the waiting room,

16:28.155 --> 16:32.568
no holocomic books
more than six months old, house calls.

16:32.743 --> 16:35.827
I caught a bad cold
when I was nine years old.

16:35.996 --> 16:39.697
He whipped up a pot of garlic soup
and brought it over.

16:40.834 --> 16:44.840
- Your report?
- I still have tests to perform,

16:44.254 --> 16:49.249
but other than his irritating lapses
into nostalgia, I see nothing wrong.

16:49.426 --> 16:52.470
You'll have to round up
another suspect.

16:52.221 --> 16:57.215
On the contrary. I ran a forensic sweep
of the navigational control.

16:57.392 --> 17:00.620
I found traces of your DNA
on the console.

17:00.229 --> 17:01.639
That's impossible.

17:01.813 --> 17:05.728
The cellular residue you left
is less than 12 hours old.

17:05.901 --> 17:08.606
Do you still maintain your innocence?

17:10.239 --> 17:12.278
I don't know what to think.

17:13.825 --> 17:17.526
Perhaps my biomolecular scan
will reveal something.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.743
Keep me informed, Doctor.

17:33.950 --> 17:36.464
I found the ion trail
of the ship that attacked us.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.178
It leads into the dark matter nebula.

17:39.351 --> 17:43.990
This is the nebula
and this is the ion trail.

17:43.272 --> 17:47.850
- Their flight path is erratic.
- These planetoids inside the nebula,

17:48.260 --> 17:52.273
they may be generating
a dangerous gravitational effect.

17:52.447 --> 17:56.694
The chances are they're taking
the only safe way through.

17:56.869 --> 18:01.320
I recommend we follow
their exact flight path.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.614
Agreed. Lay in a course to the...

18:03.792 --> 18:08.419
We're dropping to impulse power.
I'm reading a massive energy drain.

18:08.589 --> 18:13.100
- And the warp core is shutting down.
- Engineering, report.

18:13.177 --> 18:16.177
Lieutenant Torres, please respond.

18:16.346 --> 18:19.762
Mr Kim, take the bridge.
Tuvok, you're with me.

18:21.977 --> 18:24.385
- Torres, what's going on?
- Captain?

18:24.563 --> 18:28.263
You've initiated
an emergency warp core shutdown.

18:30.277 --> 18:34.903
Too late. It'll take two hours
to regenerate the dilithium matrix.

18:35.730 --> 18:37.695
Get the rest of the systems
back on-line.

18:37.868 --> 18:41.284
Apparently,
you've crashed the main computer,

18:41.455 --> 18:44.824
Iocked out the bridge
and stopped this ship cold.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.461
- Do you want to tell me why?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

18:53.634 --> 18:56.255
What the hell is going on here?

19:00.150 --> 19:03.716
I found something
and you're not going to like it.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.686
This is Mr Paris's memory engram
for the last 24 hours.

19:08.857 --> 19:14.895
It has a very consistent and distinctive
modulation, except at 13:50 hours.

19:15.720 --> 19:19.200
For 1 minute 47 seconds,
a different memory pattern appeared.

19:19.368 --> 19:24.991
It is the exact moment he presumably
tampered with navigational control.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.454
It gets worse. In addition to that,

19:27.626 --> 19:30.496
there is another disruption
at 12:02 hours,

19:30.671 --> 19:34.400
the moment he allegedly entered
the new course.

19:34.216 --> 19:38.344
I found an identical disruption
in Lieutenant Torres's pattern

19:38.512 --> 19:41.299
at the moment
she shut down warp power.

19:41.473 --> 19:44.940
This is a neuroelectrical signature,

19:44.268 --> 19:48.348
what I believe is another brain wave
superimposed on their own.

19:48.522 --> 19:52.983
- Another brain wave? Whose?
- I don't know.

19:53.151 --> 19:57.149
It has an unusual energy signature,
one I've never seen.

19:57.322 --> 20:00.193
Doctor, what are you saying?

20:02.286 --> 20:06.995
One possible explanation and the only
one I can think of at the moment

20:07.165 --> 20:12.207
is that an unknown alien entity
momentarily took control of their minds.

20:12.379 --> 20:15.997
Intruder alert.
Security personnel, go to Condition 4.

20:16.174 --> 20:20.883
It is possible the intruder
returned with us in the shuttlecraft.

20:22.389 --> 20:26.968
If we're right
and there is an alien here...

20:28.187 --> 20:32.433
...it seems intent on preventing us
going back to the nebula.

20:32.608 --> 20:37.850
What's more, it seems to have the
ability to jump from person to person.

20:39.156 --> 20:42.856
If that's true,
it could be in any one of us,

20:43.350 --> 20:46.238
controlling our actions,
without us realising.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.820
Well, except for me.

20:50.751 --> 20:55.709
That's true.
So far, it's only affected organic beings.

20:55.881 --> 21:01.468
If it could control the computer directly,
it probably would have done it already.

21:01.637 --> 21:08.540
Which means... the doctor is the only
person we can trust at this moment.

21:12.731 --> 21:16.978
Doctor, until we have eliminated
this alien presence,

21:17.152 --> 21:21.980
I can't take the risk that it could
take over any of the senior officers.

21:23.200 --> 21:28.407
I'd like to transfer all command codes
to you until further notice.

21:28.580 --> 21:32.115
What would that mean?
That I am in command?

21:32.292 --> 21:35.542
No, but you will act as a failsafe.

21:36.755 --> 21:41.713
If you feel at any time that any one of us
are under the influence of the alien,

21:41.885 --> 21:46.132
you can countermand our orders
and take control of the ship.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.346
Do you feel up to it?

21:48.517 --> 21:53.600
Of course. I make
life-and-death decisions every day.

21:53.230 --> 21:55.187
I feel better already.

21:55.357 --> 21:58.940
Computer, transfer all command codes
to the Doctor.

21:59.111 --> 22:02.277
Authorisation, Janeway 841 alpha 65.

22:02.447 --> 22:05.235
Command code transfer complete.

22:05.409 --> 22:08.860
Let's get the warp core
on-line ahead of schedule.

22:10.289 --> 22:13.989
Captain, I heard what's happened.
I think you're right.

22:14.167 --> 22:17.999
There is an alien presence.
I've been sensing something.

22:18.172 --> 22:21.700
I can't describe it,
but something is here.

22:21.174 --> 22:24.674
- Do you know where?
- No, just that it's on the ship.

22:24.845 --> 22:28.214
Kes's telepathic abilities
are undisciplined.

22:28.390 --> 22:31.593
If I could initiate
a Vulcan mind-meld with her,

22:31.768 --> 22:35.718
I'll help her focus
those abilities to detect the alien.

22:35.897 --> 22:41.105
- I'm willing to do that.
- Very well. Proceed, Mr Tuvok.

22:51.413 --> 22:54.367
The captain wants
to seal off critical areas.

22:54.541 --> 22:57.661
Secure the access hatch
of Jefferies tube A-17.

22:57.836 --> 23:00.457
What exactly are we securing against?

23:00.630 --> 23:04.165
We're not sure.
We think it's a noncorporeal alien.

23:04.343 --> 23:07.877
Noncorporeal?
That means it can move through...

23:08.550 --> 23:11.506
Medical emergency.
Deck 7. Section 13 Alpha.

23:17.606 --> 23:19.646
Captain's log, supplemental.

23:19.816 --> 23:24.609
Mr Tuvok and Kes were both hit
by an unidentified energy discharge.

23:24.780 --> 23:28.860
Tuvok was not badly hurt,
but Kes is in a coma.

23:29.340 --> 23:31.703
It was like the shuttlecraft attack.

23:31.870 --> 23:36.117
An energy discharge came
through the bulkhead and hit us.

23:36.291 --> 23:39.577
We didn't pick up a discharge
on the sensors.

23:39.753 --> 23:42.671
Perhaps it is beyond
our sensor bandwidth.

23:42.839 --> 23:46.291
Perhaps, but that discharge
came from somewhere.

23:46.468 --> 23:50.929
The most thorough scanning device
we have is a magneton scanner.

23:51.980 --> 23:53.304
We could search
centimetre by centimetre,

23:53.475 --> 23:57.687
but that wouldn't do much good.
This alien could be anywhere.

23:57.854 --> 24:03.620
What if we could perform a magneton
scan on the entire ship all at once?

24:03.235 --> 24:07.102
- What do you suggest?
- A magneton flash scan.

24:07.281 --> 24:11.907
We could reconfigure every
sensor array to emit a single burst.

24:12.770 --> 24:15.944
It might illuminate anomalous energy.
Harry, what do you think?

24:24.756 --> 24:28.968
- Whoa. What did I do?
- Stay where you are, Mr Kim.

24:29.887 --> 24:33.670
I see nothing unusual,
but that doesn't mean anything.

24:33.849 --> 24:36.885
Mr Kim, what were you doing just now?

24:37.853 --> 24:39.892
I was just thinking.

24:40.981 --> 24:45.939
I was remembering an old study
I saw about magneton scanners.

24:47.237 --> 24:49.859
I guess my mind
started to wander a bit.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.907
I'm very disturbed
by what just happened.

24:55.287 --> 25:00.957
We have no idea what occurs when
someone is occupied by this alien.

25:01.126 --> 25:04.412
If we point a finger
when someone gets distracted,

25:04.588 --> 25:08.288
it won't be long before paranoia
sweeps the ship.

25:08.467 --> 25:13.295
Tuvok, B'Elanna, I want you to get
started on that magneton flash scan.

25:13.472 --> 25:16.342
It's worth a try. Dismissed.

25:20.479 --> 25:26.102
And that's not all. Ensign Parsons
ordered his pejuta cold.

25:26.276 --> 25:30.250
- So?
- He always drinks it hot. With lemon.

25:30.197 --> 25:34.111
But not today.
Today it's cold pejuta, hold the lemon.

25:34.284 --> 25:39.770
A man changing his drink order doesn't
mean he's possessed by an alien.

25:39.247 --> 25:42.617
Nevertheless,
don't you think you should scan him,

25:42.793 --> 25:46.430
or dissect him, or something,
just to make sure?

25:47.130 --> 25:50.546
I could examine every crew member
you've mentioned

25:50.717 --> 25:52.757
and it wouldn't do any good.

25:52.928 --> 25:56.926
From what we can tell, the alien
jumps from person to person.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.931
It sounds to me like
you're defending Ensign Parsons.

26:01.103 --> 26:06.393
I'm not defending him. I'm just pointing
out you're acting a little paranoid.

26:06.567 --> 26:10.516
In fact, one could say
you're acting a little too paranoid.

26:10.696 --> 26:13.946
Are you suggesting
that I could possibly...

26:14.116 --> 26:19.656
I can assure you, not even an alien
could make me do anything to hurt Kes.

26:22.165 --> 26:26.543
All I'm suggesting, Mr Neelix,
is that paranoia will aggravate

26:26.712 --> 26:30.875
your already precarious
emotional condition. Try to relax.

26:32.217 --> 26:35.384
I don't think Kes
has any permanent damage.

26:35.554 --> 26:38.638
I'll let you know
the moment I revive her.

26:39.975 --> 26:44.352
I'll be back as soon as you wake.
Don't worry. You're in good hands.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.858
Thank you, Doctor.

26:54.698 --> 26:58.281
- What are you doing?
- Reconfiguring the sensor relays.

26:58.452 --> 27:01.287
- I will only be a minute.
- Must you do it now?

27:01.455 --> 27:06.283
- I'm in the middle of a treatment.
- I am sorry, Doctor. Captain's orders.

27:06.460 --> 27:09.165
- How is she?
- No irreparable damage.

27:10.380 --> 27:13.963
Her injuries are different
from Commander Chakotay's.

27:14.134 --> 27:16.921
Her bio-neural energy is intact.

27:17.950 --> 27:20.215
I'm curious about the contusions
on her neck.

27:20.390 --> 27:23.344
They're not consistent
with an energy discharge.

27:23.518 --> 27:26.934
They look like wounds
from a physical struggle.

27:27.105 --> 27:30.688
Odd. There was no physical struggle
that I can recall.

27:30.859 --> 27:32.899
I just don't understand it.

27:33.700 --> 27:38.277
These injuries resemble an extreme
trauma to the trapezius nerve bundle.

27:38.450 --> 27:42.151
It's as though her nerve fibres
have been ruptured.

27:45.499 --> 27:47.538
Come in.

27:49.127 --> 27:53.836
Lieutenant Torres and I will initiate
the magneton scan in two hours.

27:54.700 --> 27:56.629
It will be a high-intensity burst.

27:56.802 --> 28:02.306
It will cause dizziness in all crew,
including myself, for several seconds.

28:02.474 --> 28:05.309
Make an announcement
before you initiate it.

28:05.477 --> 28:10.104
Aye, Captain. And there is
another matter of some concern.

28:10.274 --> 28:14.223
Kes's injuries were not
caused by an energy discharge.

28:14.403 --> 28:19.230
The Doctor has evidence
that she was physically assaulted.

28:20.909 --> 28:22.949
Assaulted?

28:25.831 --> 28:30.658
- But you weren't physically assaulted.
- That is correct.

28:30.836 --> 28:34.390
Is it possible
that you inflicted her wounds?

28:35.424 --> 28:39.718
- Me?
- Maybe you were inhabited by the alien.

28:41.263 --> 28:45.261
It is possible. The Doctor
could run a neurological scan

28:45.434 --> 28:47.510
to see if I show memory disruption.

28:47.686 --> 28:50.940
Agreed. Janeway to sickbay.

28:51.815 --> 28:55.184
Activate Emergency Medical
Holographic System.

28:55.360 --> 28:59.690
Unable to comply.
The EMH program has been disabled.

28:59.865 --> 29:01.904
Disabled? By whom?

29:02.750 --> 29:04.115
Unknown.

29:07.247 --> 29:12.242
The Doctor's initialisation routine
has been locked out. It's encrypted.

29:12.419 --> 29:14.625
I can't reactivate the program.

29:14.797 --> 29:18.296
It appears
the lockout originated above Deck 4.

29:18.467 --> 29:20.792
Why would someone
deactivate the Doctor?

29:22.950 --> 29:24.586
He holds Voyager's command codes.

29:24.765 --> 29:29.474
Yes, but once he was deactivated,
the codes reverted back to me.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.599
If we assume the alien
could not take over the Doctor,

29:35.776 --> 29:40.936
then it would try to force the command
codes back into a humanoid host.

29:45.577 --> 29:47.202
Me.

29:51.583 --> 29:56.328
It's too dangerous for one person
to retain the command codes.

29:56.505 --> 29:59.921
I suggest we divide them
into two code groupings.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.131
A sensible precaution.

30:02.302 --> 30:06.217
You are the reasonable choice
to hold the second grouping,

30:06.390 --> 30:10.637
if there's such a thing
as a reasonable choice right now.

30:12.271 --> 30:16.315
The alien could occupy
either one of us at any time.

30:16.483 --> 30:19.733
But presumably,
not both of us at the same time.

30:19.903 --> 30:24.150
I'll tell the bridge crew.
We'll all act as checks and balances.

30:24.324 --> 30:27.824
I want you all to be aware of something

30:27.995 --> 30:30.118
I must assume was due to the alien.

30:30.289 --> 30:32.447
The Doctor has been deactivated

30:32.624 --> 30:37.535
and we can't get him back.
I'm dividing my command protocols.

30:40.507 --> 30:42.547
Captain?

30:46.513 --> 30:48.755
Stun her! She's the alien!

31:19.463 --> 31:24.504
- That should do it, Captain.
- Thank you. I feel better already.

31:24.676 --> 31:27.511
- Any luck getting the Doctor back?
- Not yet.

31:27.679 --> 31:30.301
Someone put up
one hell of a roadblock.

31:30.474 --> 31:34.139
I have to break through
at least six levels of encryption.

31:34.311 --> 31:37.561
- How long will it take?
- Two or three hours.

31:37.731 --> 31:41.147
Torres to Janeway.
Can you come to engineering?

31:41.318 --> 31:44.235
- There's something you should see.
- On my way.

31:44.404 --> 31:49.647
Mr Paris, you're our temporary medic.
Ensign, I need you on the bridge.

31:53.247 --> 31:57.624
I tried to reconstruct
the sensor logs from the shuttlecraft.

31:57.793 --> 32:01.458
I didn't have any luck
until I ran a parity trace scan.

32:01.630 --> 32:05.675
The sensor logs weren't
destroyed by an energy discharge.

32:05.842 --> 32:09.294
Someone erased them
and overloaded the sensor matrix

32:09.471 --> 32:13.172
to make it look like
they'd been damaged. It gets worse.

32:13.350 --> 32:18.593
There was enough information left
for me to reconstruct what happened.

32:18.772 --> 32:20.812
They were near a nebula

32:20.983 --> 32:25.276
and there was an energy discharge,
but there was no other ship.

32:26.488 --> 32:28.528
- No ship?
- I'm certain of it.

32:28.699 --> 32:31.949
The energy discharge
came from the nebula itself.

32:38.125 --> 32:42.123
- Why would Tuvok lie?
- Was he under the alien's influence?

32:42.296 --> 32:45.546
Bridge to Janeway.
We're approaching the nebula.

32:45.716 --> 32:49.490
How long until
the magneton flash scan is ready?

32:49.219 --> 32:53.513
The sensor arrays are charging now.
15, maybe 20 minutes.

32:53.682 --> 32:56.932
When it's ready,
transfer control to the bridge.

32:57.102 --> 33:02.600
In the meantime, let's take a look
at what it is we're not supposed to see.

33:10.157 --> 33:15.151
Mr Tuvok, can you locate the ion trail
of the alien ship that attacked you?

33:15.329 --> 33:17.368
I believe so.

33:19.666 --> 33:22.740
Mr Kim, lay in that course.

33:24.129 --> 33:26.371
Shields are at maximum.

33:26.548 --> 33:28.837
All preparations
for entering are complete.

33:29.900 --> 33:34.430
I've finished the Doctor's bioanalysis
on Kes before he was deactivated.

33:34.598 --> 33:39.509
I think he was on to something.
If I'm interpreting his data correctly,

33:39.686 --> 33:44.147
the bruises on her neck were
the result of a Vulcan neck pinch.

33:49.112 --> 33:50.904
Lieutenant?

33:51.730 --> 33:55.900
I have no memory of injuring Kes.
Perhaps I was occupied by the alien.

33:56.780 --> 33:57.869
Perhaps so.

33:58.380 --> 34:02.285
But then... why does it
keep attacking you?

34:03.418 --> 34:08.579
In three separate instances now,
it's assaulted you.

34:09.632 --> 34:13.297
I am the chief of security.
It may see me as a threat.

34:13.469 --> 34:17.385
So far you've posed no greater threat
than anyone else.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.842
And yet it keeps going after you.

34:21.937 --> 34:26.480
Captain, you are having a typically
human response to circumstances

34:26.650 --> 34:30.897
which are inexplicable,
commonly known as paranoia.

34:31.710 --> 34:32.862
Maybe,

34:33.310 --> 34:37.444
but paranoia's not keeping me
from picking up this ion trail.

34:37.619 --> 34:41.534
- What bandwidth are you on?
- I'm using a multiphasic scan.

34:41.706 --> 34:44.956
If you examine the alpha K-band,
you will see it.

34:46.670 --> 34:50.371
Yes. Here it is.
A very interesting ion trail.

34:50.549 --> 34:54.795
There's no sign of
any subspace distortions in its wake.

34:56.179 --> 35:00.723
According to these readings,
it's a ship without engines.

35:03.228 --> 35:08.852
You're lying, Tuvok. There is
no alien ship and there never was.

35:09.260 --> 35:14.364
We're not going into the nebula until we
get answers. Mr Kim, reverse course...

35:14.531 --> 35:19.952
Belay that order. The alien has been
keeping us from entering the nebula.

35:20.120 --> 35:24.533
I suspect she has been occupied.
I am relieving her of command.

35:24.708 --> 35:27.662
Proceed into the nebula,
one-half impulse.

35:27.836 --> 35:29.876
Don't do it, Harry.

35:31.131 --> 35:33.171
Now, Ensign.

35:36.803 --> 35:39.674
No, sir. I won't do it.

35:39.848 --> 35:43.846
This phaser is on wide-beam dispersal
and set to kill.

35:44.190 --> 35:46.225
I am taking command of this bridge.

35:46.396 --> 35:49.646
I must ask you to stand together
where I can see you.

35:49.816 --> 35:52.438
Step away from the console, Ensign.

35:58.200 --> 36:01.320
Captain, we're entering the nebula.

36:12.631 --> 36:19.345
Captain, I'm picking up energy pulses in
the nebula coherent with the biomatrix.

36:19.513 --> 36:22.763
- Life-forms.
- And they're heading this way.

36:25.102 --> 36:28.767
Those beings out there,
are they your people?

36:28.939 --> 36:32.557
We are the Komar. This is our domain.

36:57.676 --> 37:00.677
- What is it?
- The warp core's been ejected.

37:00.846 --> 37:04.546
No. We must continue.

37:05.476 --> 37:10.268
Torres to Bridge. Captain, I think
I was just taken over by the alien.

37:10.439 --> 37:14.686
I was working the plasma relays
and then I ejected the warp core.

37:14.860 --> 37:18.774
- Acknowledged, Lieutenant. Stand by.
- I don't get it.

37:18.947 --> 37:22.945
If the alien's in Tuvok,
how could it be down in engineering?

37:23.118 --> 37:25.158
I don't know.

37:25.329 --> 37:27.571
Unless there are two aliens.

37:28.665 --> 37:30.705
Two?

37:32.836 --> 37:38.459
Wait a minute. Lieutenant Torres
isn't authorised to eject the warp core.

37:38.634 --> 37:41.967
That requires
a command code authorisation.

37:42.137 --> 37:45.720
Computer, who authorised
the ejection of the warp core?

37:45.891 --> 37:49.889
Authorisation was
entered by Commander Chakotay.

37:53.899 --> 37:56.816
- Chakotay.
- How is that possible?

37:58.280 --> 38:01.290
The alien in Tuvok
wants us in that nebula,

38:01.198 --> 38:04.152
but another presence
is trying to keep us out.

38:04.326 --> 38:07.327
It doesn't make sense,
unless it's Chakotay

38:07.496 --> 38:10.117
and he knows we'll be in danger.

38:10.290 --> 38:13.991
- But he's in sickbay. He's braindead.
- Maybe not.

38:14.169 --> 38:17.419
Maybe his neural energy
was displaced somehow

38:17.589 --> 38:20.460
and he's able to move
from person to person.

38:23.178 --> 38:28.600
Tuvok's engaged emergency thrusters.
We're moving again, Captain.

38:37.192 --> 38:41.771
You brought us here for what?
To extract our neural energy?

38:41.947 --> 38:43.986
Very perceptive, Captain.

38:44.157 --> 38:48.866
The neural energy of your crew will
sustain my people for years to come.

38:49.370 --> 38:51.770
You don't have to do this.

38:51.248 --> 38:54.617
Maybe we can help you find
another source of energy.

38:54.793 --> 38:57.664
We're under attack.
We're being bombarded.

39:26.867 --> 39:32.407
The magneton scan identified the entity.
It was a trianic-based energy being.

39:33.540 --> 39:36.458
Looks like he's joined
his friends outside.

39:36.627 --> 39:39.331
Shields are holding, but they won't last.

39:39.504 --> 39:43.336
The radiation is blinding our sensors.
I can't find a way out.

39:43.508 --> 39:46.260
If we reverse course,
we can backtrack.

39:46.428 --> 39:49.429
- Yes, ma'am.
- I don't know if that'll work.

39:49.598 --> 39:53.892
Tuvok's course was complicated.
We're going into the nebula.

39:54.610 --> 39:56.896
Reconstruct Tuvok's navigational logs.

39:57.630 --> 39:59.103
I'm on it, Captain.

40:00.359 --> 40:03.858
Shields down to 65%!
They are penetrating our defences.

40:26.468 --> 40:30.382
I'm having no luck.
Tuvok deleted the navigational logs.

40:30.555 --> 40:32.797
He made sure we wouldn't get out.

40:32.975 --> 40:35.970
- Neelix to Bridge.
- Go ahead.

40:35.269 --> 40:39.729
Captain, I can't be sure, but I think
I was just taken over by the alien.

40:39.898 --> 40:42.210
I've done something strange.

40:42.192 --> 40:46.653
I've rearranged the stones
on the medicine wheel.

40:46.822 --> 40:49.942
Maybe Chakotay's
trying to tell us something.

40:50.117 --> 40:55.703
Mr Kim, activate sickbay Visual
Relay 16 and put it on the viewscreen.

40:55.873 --> 40:57.912
Aye, Captain.

41:01.920 --> 41:05.870
What is it? What does it mean?

41:05.257 --> 41:09.207
- Is it a code, a message?
- Or a map?

41:09.386 --> 41:13.680
Overlay a star map of the nebula
on the current viewscreen image.

41:16.727 --> 41:20.677
The stones are in the same position
as those planetoids.

41:20.856 --> 41:23.976
Chakotay must be using them
to point a way out.

41:25.270 --> 41:31.528
Mr Kim, lay in a course taking us along
a line connecting the three planetoids.

41:31.700 --> 41:33.740
Engage.

41:39.333 --> 41:43.247
Shields failing.
The aliens are penetrating the hull.

41:43.420 --> 41:47.300
- Mr Kim, report.
- We're passing the third planetoid.

41:47.174 --> 41:49.843
Dark matter thinning.
Normal space ahead.

41:50.100 --> 41:54.900
Transfer all power to the thrusters,
including life-support.

42:00.771 --> 42:04.555
We've cleared the nebula.
Main power coming back on-line.

42:04.733 --> 42:08.190
Shields at full strength.
Hull integrity normal.

42:08.195 --> 42:10.353
The aliens are not pursuing.

42:17.162 --> 42:20.661
Captain's log, stardate 48735.9.

42:20.833 --> 42:25.708
We have returned to where we ejected
the warp core and retrieved it.

42:25.879 --> 42:31.122
Now we're hoping the doctor can
reintegrate Chakotay's consciousness.

42:36.598 --> 42:39.718
- Did it work?
- It appears so.

42:42.620 --> 42:44.102
Commander.

42:45.440 --> 42:47.480
Can you hear me?

42:50.737 --> 42:52.148
Yes.

42:54.157 --> 42:57.158
I'm a little dizzy,
but I think I'm all here.

43:00.956 --> 43:03.791
How did you reintegrate
his consciousness?

43:03.959 --> 43:06.532
It involved three neural transceivers,

43:06.712 --> 43:10.840
two cortical stimulators
and 50 gigaquads of computer memory.

43:11.800 --> 43:16.250
I would take you through the process,
but it would take ten hours to explain.

43:17.556 --> 43:20.177
Needless to say, it was remarkable.

43:20.350 --> 43:25.960
I would write a paper if there were
a forum in which to publish it.

43:30.652 --> 43:32.692
What happened, Commander?

43:35.323 --> 43:37.731
After the attack on the shuttle...

43:38.827 --> 43:43.573
...I had the sensation
of floating above my own body.

43:43.749 --> 43:45.788
I thought I was dead.

43:45.959 --> 43:50.289
When the shuttle returned to Voyager,
you were still disembodied?

43:50.464 --> 43:52.503
Yes.

43:52.674 --> 43:54.714
I couldn't speak.

43:54.885 --> 43:56.924
I couldn't touch anything.

43:58.550 --> 44:03.891
But then I found if I concentrated on
someone who was in the room with me,

44:04.610 --> 44:07.150
I could share their consciousness.

44:07.189 --> 44:10.439
At first, I could only do little things.

44:10.609 --> 44:14.310
Push buttons, work a console.

44:14.488 --> 44:18.817
As time went on,
it became easier to do more.

44:20.118 --> 44:24.662
- Sorry to knock you around, Tuvok.
- No apology is necessary.

44:30.253 --> 44:32.293
Good job, Commander.

44:32.464 --> 44:34.504
And welcome back.

44:35.342 --> 44:39.126
To be honest, I feel like I never left.
