WEBVTT

00:18.519 --> 00:21.522
That gentleman
and his daughter,
the money they took,

00:21.622 --> 00:23.491
ain't never coming back.

00:23.591 --> 00:26.660
We're going to recreate
my father's system here
without my father.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.597
A consortium with all of you
sharing in the profits.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.100
I'll do that the moment you
lift the ban on Captain Vane.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.434
Charles Vane is an animal.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.503
You have until dark
to come to your senses.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.438
Do you have some problem
with us holding onto
that whore?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.540
It's up to us
when we're done with her.

00:40.708 --> 00:44.278
Hunting the Maria Aleyne
was never about money.

00:44.378 --> 00:48.282
It was an execution.
Good men will die

00:48.382 --> 00:51.885
for some hidden agenda,
the Barlow woman's agenda.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.655
Boston is more forgiving
of one's past.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.290
With my family's assistance,

00:56.390 --> 00:58.659
one might find
a new life there.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.994
Richard:
Captain Bryson sailed
the Velasco route

01:01.095 --> 01:02.663
for 10 years
and was never boarded.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.100
Gates:
He's in a reinforced hold.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.269
There's no way to get
the guns off the boat.

01:08.369 --> 01:11.505
Anybody we send down
there is just gonna get
cut to shreds.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.275
Bryson:
Mr. Guthrie's orders
were explicit.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.777
No matter what,
I was to make sure that
you were on this ship.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.046
"I sent a message
to the captain of
the Scarborough.

01:19.147 --> 01:22.250
I told him where
he would find you."

01:22.350 --> 01:25.119
Good God,
the Scarborough!

01:27.455 --> 01:30.458
( theme music playing )

03:03.884 --> 03:05.886
( fire crackling )

03:15.329 --> 03:17.431
( goats bleating )

03:26.674 --> 03:29.710
( men shouting )

03:38.952 --> 03:40.220
How far have we drifted?

03:40.321 --> 03:43.123
Not far.
A few miles.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.359
Fucking Scarborough's
out there, Billy.

03:45.459 --> 03:48.161
I can feel it.
Just waiting for
a whiff of us

03:48.262 --> 03:49.963
so she can set
those guns ablaze.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.165
Lars is almost ready.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.335
He'll have that bunker
open in no time.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.607
Four hours till sunup.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.010
If we can't get
those guns before then,

04:03.110 --> 04:06.347
Flint will let us
leave, right?

04:21.962 --> 04:23.797
Here you go.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.768
The wick's fast,
so don't light her

04:27.868 --> 04:29.637
until you're right up
to the bunker.

04:29.737 --> 04:33.273
Get it through
the murder hole
and then take cover.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.443
The vanguard will
be right behind you.

04:35.543 --> 04:38.278
While Bryson and his men
are choking on the smoke,

04:38.379 --> 04:41.382
we'll bust down the door,
take him out,

04:41.482 --> 04:43.784
grab our guns
and be on the way home.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.691
Did he say
anything to you?

04:54.828 --> 04:55.829
About what?

04:58.799 --> 05:01.802
Bryson slipping off
with our guns is one thing,

05:01.902 --> 05:04.538
but bringing
the Scarborough with him?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.907
How did he even know
the navy was around?

05:07.007 --> 05:09.377
Richard Guthrie
must have been involved.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.445
No shit.
Do you think?

05:11.545 --> 05:13.847
Where I get confused
is that Richard Guthrie

05:13.947 --> 05:16.183
was supposed
to be under guard at
the Barlow woman's home.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.185
Isn't that what he told us?

05:18.285 --> 05:20.888
I mean, what do we
really know about her?

05:20.988 --> 05:23.891
She shares
his love of books?

05:25.258 --> 05:27.828
Isn't it about time we start
asking some real questions?

05:27.928 --> 05:30.030
Billy, not now.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.500
Please.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.005
( speaks African
dialect )

06:12.105 --> 06:13.707
He wants you to take it.

06:13.807 --> 06:17.244
( speaks African
dialect )

06:17.344 --> 06:19.413
To place it in the hole
above your head.

06:19.513 --> 06:23.316
To signal to pirates.

06:23.417 --> 06:27.020
( speaks African
dialect )

06:27.120 --> 06:28.722
He says if we help them,

06:28.822 --> 06:31.492
they'll bring us back
to their home.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.327
No.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.129
( speaks African
dialect )

06:36.229 --> 06:38.599
- He says--
- I know what he says.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.902
He says in Nassau
a slave can be free,

06:42.002 --> 06:43.571
get a job and a wage.

06:43.671 --> 06:46.173
Maybe for him.
He's strong.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.241
A few others.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.644
The rest of you,
don't kid yourself.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.781
You are cargo,
in Nassau or otherwise.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.149
You would decide this
for us all?

06:56.249 --> 06:57.485
This has nothing
to do with you.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.887
We have a chance to be free.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.955
I don't care.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.392
There are weapons
on this ship

07:05.493 --> 07:08.462
the pirates plan
to return to Nassau,

07:08.562 --> 07:11.599
weapons that are very
dangerous to someone I love.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.936
No matter what happens
to me or to you,

07:16.036 --> 07:18.739
those weapons
must not be returned.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.212
( hisses )

07:39.960 --> 07:41.829
( men shouting )

07:43.597 --> 07:45.899
( door opens )

07:45.999 --> 07:48.702
( footsteps )

08:05.352 --> 08:08.355
Lilywhite:
Time has come for us
to tell those

08:08.455 --> 08:10.323
who are aiming
to make us slaves

08:10.423 --> 08:13.561
they are no longer welcome
in this place.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.428
- Not any longer!
- ( cheering )

08:15.529 --> 08:18.031
Fuck 'em!
Fucking bastards.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.967
No fucking longer.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.935
Two hours.

08:22.035 --> 08:25.539
Two fucking hours
she's been holed up
in there.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.275
Well, I for one think
this is a good sign.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.013
What?

08:33.113 --> 08:35.982
Clearly she's taking
the decision seriously.

08:36.082 --> 08:39.519
I'm sorry, you think
it's a good sign she's
taking this seriously?

08:39.620 --> 08:43.691
I can't even-- Jesus.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.760
What I believe
Captain Lawrence
meant to say

08:46.860 --> 08:49.129
is that as long
as it takes for Miss Guthrie

08:49.229 --> 08:52.600
to emerge from behind
that door and lift the ban
on Captain Vane--

08:52.700 --> 08:54.501
a decision which,
a few hours ago,

08:54.602 --> 08:57.605
she said would be taken
over her dead body--

08:57.705 --> 09:00.941
then Captain Hornigold
over there

09:01.041 --> 09:04.578
walks away from our nascent
shipping consortium,

09:04.678 --> 09:06.546
killing it in its cradle.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.981
He withdraws his men
from the street,

09:08.081 --> 09:10.383
at which point
Captain Lilywhite
and his mob

09:10.483 --> 09:13.353
are free to burn
everything in sight with
the Guthrie name on it.

09:13.453 --> 09:16.223
All of Nassau will,
most likely, descend
into fiery mayhem

09:16.323 --> 09:18.692
from which we will all
be lucky to escape alive.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.128
Every moment that
that door remains closed

09:21.228 --> 09:24.765
is a moment that Miss Guthrie
is considering that outcome

09:24.865 --> 09:28.602
as a viable,
even preferable
alternative

09:28.702 --> 09:30.570
to merely swallowing
her pride.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.542
I don't know.

09:35.643 --> 09:39.346
Perhaps you need
to have a little bit
more faith in people.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.775
I'll take the good news
to Captain Lilywhite.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.243
Let him know
he can stand down.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.350
( men laugh )

10:25.358 --> 10:27.194
Good news, everyone!

10:27.294 --> 10:29.629
The cunt's knuckled under.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.932
- ( cheering )
- We're back in
fucking business.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.902
You hear that, eh?
( laughing )

10:41.875 --> 10:43.811
So what's this now?

10:43.911 --> 10:46.880
She don't want no one
touching the whore.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.351
What the fuck's your problem?

10:51.451 --> 10:53.053
Another step
and I'll show you.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.188
Mr. Hamund, permit me
a moment with our friend here.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.759
Talk some sense
into her, Jack.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.297
Before she goes
and does something stupid.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.602
Tell me
this is not happening.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.740
Tell me you weren't
about to fight Mr. Hamund
over that fucking whore.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.307
Don't call her that.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.712
It would appear that
I've failed to appreciate

11:18.812 --> 11:20.513
just how deeply
this situation
has disturbed you.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.816
But if you're intent
on following this course
of action,

11:22.916 --> 11:24.885
then I suppose we should
do our farewells now

11:24.985 --> 11:26.720
because I don't think I can
stomach watching the men

11:26.820 --> 11:29.522
throwing you into
that tent as well and having
their way with you,

11:29.622 --> 11:32.192
which is where I fear
this story ends

11:32.292 --> 11:34.194
unless you pull
your shit together.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.808
( chuckles )

12:04.992 --> 12:06.626
Captain says no light.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.829
I know.

12:22.309 --> 12:25.378
Miranda's voice:
"To the Honorable Justice
Addington Thomas,

12:25.478 --> 12:27.280
Massachusetts Bay Colony.

12:30.117 --> 12:33.253
I petition you
under the advisement
of your friend

12:33.353 --> 12:35.555
Mr. Richard Guthrie

12:35.655 --> 12:39.026
to bestow your favor
and influence.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.461
You may know
Captain James Flint

12:41.561 --> 12:43.864
by reputation

12:43.964 --> 12:47.034
through stories
of his past misdeeds,

12:47.134 --> 12:50.971
but you might not know
of his desire to repent.

12:51.071 --> 12:54.174
He is a good man,
a decent man,

12:54.274 --> 12:57.277
eager to renounce
his transgressions at sea

12:57.377 --> 13:00.680
and seek life
in a part of the world
willing to accept a man

13:00.780 --> 13:03.483
humbled and penitent.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.819
Were such
a thing possible,

13:05.919 --> 13:08.488
would such a place exist?

13:08.588 --> 13:12.059
It is with this very hope
that I write you today.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.427
I've enclosed
a bill of exchange

13:14.527 --> 13:16.629
for £500

13:16.729 --> 13:18.498
to be spent
at your discretion

13:18.598 --> 13:21.568
toward procuring whatever
permissions necessary.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.940
I only urge speed.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.910
He is caught
in a dangerous plot
with wicked men

13:30.010 --> 13:31.979
who will most certainly
kill him when they learn

13:32.079 --> 13:34.314
of his betrayal."

13:35.782 --> 13:37.918
Jesus.

13:38.018 --> 13:41.354
Miranda's voice:
"Believe me, your obliged
and faithful servant,

13:41.454 --> 13:42.990
Miranda Barlow."

14:38.711 --> 14:40.213
( exhales )

14:41.581 --> 14:42.515
( Lars grunts )

14:46.719 --> 14:48.488
( sighs )

15:06.806 --> 15:09.142
Get me another plan.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.412
Fuck.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.616
I need to talk
to you now.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.771
I found it
in Bryson's cabin.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.173
It's from
the Barlow woman.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.609
She wants a pardon
for Flint in Boston.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.412
She says we're gonna
kill him when we learn
of his betrayal.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.347
And?

15:47.447 --> 15:50.017
It says betrayal.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.652
I can see that.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.222
What do you want me to do
about it right now?

15:58.725 --> 16:01.328
I know about
the Maria Aleyne.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.562
What?

16:02.662 --> 16:04.931
I know Flint killed
those people for her.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.899
I know Morley saw it
and brought it to you.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.968
And I know
you did nothing.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.737
He played games with
his crewmen's lives then.

16:10.837 --> 16:13.306
He's doing it again now
and he knows he can
get away with it

16:13.406 --> 16:14.641
because we're
protecting him.

16:14.741 --> 16:17.410
- Because you
are protecting him.
- Enough.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.180
If you want to go to the crew
with this, be my guest.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.050
But I will do everything
in my power to frustrate you.
Know that.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.452
How can you say that?

16:25.552 --> 16:27.520
Because we're in
fucking battle right now

16:27.620 --> 16:30.190
and I will not undermine
his control of what is,

16:30.290 --> 16:32.225
frankly,
a shitty situation

16:32.325 --> 16:34.227
based on a letter
written by a woman

16:34.327 --> 16:37.030
neither of us know
a thing about.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.668
Just promise me that
when we get back to Nassau,

16:41.768 --> 16:44.003
we will deal with this.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.872
Everything all right?

16:45.972 --> 16:48.875
Fine.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.644
Billy's come up
with our next move.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.648
It's three hours
till sunup.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.351
Perhaps you'd like to share it
with the rest of us.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.798
( dog barking )

17:17.804 --> 17:19.606
Miranda:
Pastor Lambrick.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.642
It's later than
I'm comfortable
taking company.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.243
You shouldn't be here.

17:24.344 --> 17:27.446
I live here, Pastor.
Or hadn't you noticed?

17:27.547 --> 17:30.650
Mr. Underhill agreed
to take Mr. Guthrie in.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.120
Mr. Guthrie spun
such a tale for him.

17:33.220 --> 17:36.423
He said he's been
bribing the Lords Proprietor
in London for years.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.091
Said he planned
to use that fact

17:38.191 --> 17:40.026
to extort preferential
treatment from them

17:40.127 --> 17:42.362
when England reasserts
her rule here.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.564
He promised wealth
and prosperity.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.534
Even promised to see
Underhill declared governor.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.269
And that was it.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.404
How nice for Mr. Guthrie.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.106
It is nice.

17:53.206 --> 17:56.543
He now sleeps safely on
Mr. Underhill's plantation

17:56.643 --> 17:59.512
behind two dozen
of the most brutal overseers
in the New World.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.249
Behind walls and guns
and swords.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.083
I need no protection.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.219
Mrs. Barlow,

18:06.319 --> 18:08.721
Mr. Guthrie has betrayed
Captain Flint.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.190
And you've helped him
to do it.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.492
If half of what I've heard
of Captain Flint is true,

18:12.592 --> 18:15.528
he will not react
to your betrayal kindly.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.631
You do not understand
any of this, Pastor.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.434
Then help me understand.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.773
Help me, because I cannot
in good conscience

18:26.873 --> 18:29.509
walk away from here
believing you to be
in such peril.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.319
All right.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.741
- ( gasps )
- Good evening, cunt.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.747
If I wanted to kill you,
I'd have done it already.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.621
What a piece of shit
you are.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.389
Nose in the air.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.459
Spoiled cunt
playing at our business.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.562
Pains me being
this close to you.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.364
Should tell you how
fucking desperate I am.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.932
Desperate for what?

19:27.234 --> 19:30.102
- Your help.
- Beg your pardon?

19:30.203 --> 19:33.573
Your friend
on the beach.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.309
She fucked us
and that needed answering.

19:36.409 --> 19:39.546
But then that night,

19:39.646 --> 19:41.848
she told you
to go fuck yourself.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.183
Should have toasted her.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.419
If she had a cock,
we probably would have.

19:48.221 --> 19:51.424
What Hamund's been
doing to her...

19:52.725 --> 19:54.461
ain't right.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.063
What do you want me
to do about it?

19:57.163 --> 20:00.233
I've tried to help.
She didn't want it.
Now my hands are tied.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.769
- I can't--
- You could kill him.

20:02.869 --> 20:06.205
I'd do it myself,
but the men saw us feuding.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.708
I go near him,
I'll have them
all at my throat

20:08.808 --> 20:10.577
and no one at my back.

20:10.677 --> 20:13.112
Now's the time.
Captain's gone.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.014
Don't know how long for.

20:15.114 --> 20:16.316
Wait, gone?
Gone where?

20:16.416 --> 20:18.117
I don't know.
I don't much give a shit.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.253
Left alone on a skiff
this afternoon.

20:20.353 --> 20:24.357
But if he returns,
he'll be another one
standing at Hamund's side.

20:27.193 --> 20:29.028
If you're already
suspected by the men,

20:29.128 --> 20:32.231
what's to say they
don't suspect you no matter
how Hamund were to disappear?

20:32.332 --> 20:34.834
What's to say that suspicion
doesn't lead to questions?

20:34.934 --> 20:37.304
And what's to say those
questions don't lead to me?

20:37.404 --> 20:40.206
You fucking coward.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.708
Why? Because
I've used my head

20:41.808 --> 20:43.310
before making this mess
even worse?

20:43.410 --> 20:46.045
'Cause for all your shit,
all your posturing,

20:46.145 --> 20:47.914
you won't lift a finger
to help her.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.316
I didn't say that.

20:49.416 --> 20:52.218
You said my plan
was too dangerous.

20:52.319 --> 20:54.654
Your plan isn't
dangerous enough.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.958
Eight men
left on your crew.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.528
Eight men
who support Hamund.
You said it yourself.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.564
We kill him,
they all become threats
to both of us.

21:04.664 --> 21:07.334
- It's foolish.
- Then what the fuck
would you suggest?

21:07.434 --> 21:09.602
You want to kill Hamund,

21:09.702 --> 21:11.604
then you have
to kill them all.

21:14.240 --> 21:17.176
They disappear
all at once tonight

21:17.276 --> 21:18.778
with neither of us
implicated.

21:20.413 --> 21:21.781
There's eight of them.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.016
Their guard is up.
It's impossible.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.987
It's not impossible.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.022
We just need
a little help.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.000
( chuckles )

21:41.100 --> 21:43.035
I don't know
how else to say this

21:43.135 --> 21:45.372
except no.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.308
I suppose
there's fuck, no.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.943
Or fuck you.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.512
I think you
misunderstand.

21:52.612 --> 21:53.946
I wasn't asking you
to help me.

21:54.046 --> 21:56.215
I was granting you
the opportunity to help me.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.418
But now,
because of your tone,

21:58.518 --> 22:00.787
I'm disinclined
to be so generous.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.321
Beg pardon?

22:02.422 --> 22:03.956
Now you'll beg me for it.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.960
What the fuck
are you talking about?

22:08.060 --> 22:10.296
All those days ago
when you first proposed

22:10.397 --> 22:13.165
this arrangement
of yours to Flint--

22:13.265 --> 22:16.268
remaining with his crew,
holding onto the last
piece of the schedule

22:16.369 --> 22:18.004
to ensure you weren't
disposed of--

22:18.104 --> 22:20.507
when he asked you
what's to stop him
from killing you

22:20.607 --> 22:23.009
when all's said and done,
do you remember your answer?

22:23.109 --> 22:25.812
No, but I'm guessing
you do.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.581
I believe you said,

22:28.681 --> 22:31.083
"We might be friends
by then."

22:31.183 --> 22:32.619
( snickers )

22:32.719 --> 22:35.822
I'm sorry,
what are you driving at?

22:35.922 --> 22:37.890
You've spent enough time
with the man now.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.759
Does he strike you
as the type of person

22:39.859 --> 22:41.861
who would ever
under any circumstance

22:41.961 --> 22:43.830
leave a loose end
like you walking around?

22:46.198 --> 22:48.768
When I took your advice
and lifted the ban
on Charles Vane,

22:48.868 --> 22:52.405
I became the center
of all commerce on this
island again.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.907
Someone you don't want
as an enemy.

22:55.007 --> 22:58.244
Someone Flint doesn't
want as an enemy.

22:58.344 --> 23:02.449
The way I see it,
I may be the only person
in this world

23:02.549 --> 23:04.884
who can dissuade him
from killing you.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.391
Miranda:
I had a very
different life

23:12.492 --> 23:15.194
before I came here,

23:15.294 --> 23:17.664
a life I shared
with my husband.

23:19.432 --> 23:22.435
He was a special man,

23:22.535 --> 23:24.537
a man of ideas...

23:24.637 --> 23:26.573
about the world,

23:26.673 --> 23:28.641
about the order
of things.

23:29.809 --> 23:32.779
Writers, artists,
men of science--

23:32.879 --> 23:35.915
they'd fill our drawing room
night after night

23:36.015 --> 23:38.518
to talk and argue.

23:39.886 --> 23:42.622
Sometimes just
to listen to him.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.626
In some ways
he was like you--

23:46.726 --> 23:49.061
a shepherd
to his flock.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.632
He would have loved
to have met you.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.535
Me?

23:55.635 --> 23:57.704
You think I can play
devil's advocate.

23:57.804 --> 23:59.572
Thomas would have played
that game with you

23:59.672 --> 24:01.674
from dusk until dawn.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.943
And everything
you hold sacred,

24:04.043 --> 24:06.245
he'd leave in tatters.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.948
Not from malice or hate,

24:09.048 --> 24:11.651
but from love.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.621
From a desire to see
the yoke of shame

24:14.721 --> 24:16.923
lifted from your shoulders.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.660
You think I am ashamed?

24:22.729 --> 24:24.831
My husband
and I were happy.

24:26.533 --> 24:28.568
But in London,
a happy life

24:28.668 --> 24:30.603
can often be
a very dangerous thing.

24:32.071 --> 24:35.107
Something that other people
simply cannot abide.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.747
Thomas learned
that lesson all too well.

24:43.916 --> 24:47.119
Captain Flint was
Thomas's closest friend.

24:48.354 --> 24:50.022
And after his death,
he saw fit

24:50.122 --> 24:53.693
to spirit me here
for my own safety.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.862
Flint brought you here?

24:57.096 --> 24:58.798
You're right,
I don't understand.

24:58.898 --> 25:02.001
I just told you.
Captain Flint is
my deliverer.

25:02.101 --> 25:05.204
There's nothing more
you need to understand.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.276
Why are you here?

25:12.444 --> 25:14.213
I'm concerned
for your safety.

25:14.313 --> 25:15.915
It's late.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.685
You knew I'd be alone.
It's inappropriate.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.892
You're not here
because you want to
protect me, Pastor.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.896
You're here because
you want to fuck me.

26:08.167 --> 26:11.137
( moans )

26:14.874 --> 26:17.644
( breathing heavily )

26:32.625 --> 26:35.361
I'm sorry.
We dangle?

26:36.629 --> 26:39.365
Four men suspended
over the side.

26:39.465 --> 26:42.034
Axes, augers, charges.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.904
It's a rapid penetration
to get a charge through
the hole.

26:45.004 --> 26:48.641
Cause disruption,
distraction

26:48.741 --> 26:52.244
while we move on the bunker
through the hold below.

26:52.344 --> 26:53.545
Saw Avery try it once.

26:53.646 --> 26:56.615
- And it worked?
- I said I saw it tried.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.319
Volunteers?

27:08.260 --> 27:10.196
( sighs )

27:10.296 --> 27:12.732
Paxton.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.202
Bobby.

27:18.437 --> 27:20.339
Dooly.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.711
Logan.

27:30.449 --> 27:31.918
Something wrong?

27:32.018 --> 27:34.586
Even if we do
hack through,

27:34.687 --> 27:37.023
we'd be dangling there
like bait on a string.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.958
It's suicide.

27:39.058 --> 27:42.594
We don't have time
for a debate, Mr. Logan.

27:42.695 --> 27:44.964
Now I gave you an order.

27:45.064 --> 27:48.400
And what happens when
those orders get us killed?

27:48.500 --> 27:51.037
You send in four more?

27:51.137 --> 27:53.773
Billy, tell him
I'm right.

28:01.748 --> 28:03.215
Mr. Logan...

28:05.317 --> 28:07.686
fall in.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.722
Billy, tell him
I'm right.

28:12.558 --> 28:13.793
Captain--

28:13.893 --> 28:17.329
Mr. Logan makes
a valid point.

28:20.199 --> 28:23.602
Unfortunately,
now is not the time.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.372
( crew gasps )

28:28.975 --> 28:30.777
Anybody else
got a point

28:30.877 --> 28:33.645
they would
like to make?

28:33.746 --> 28:35.381
While we are in battle,

28:35.481 --> 28:36.983
the captain's orders
are the law.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.251
That is what
we signed up to.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.420
That is what we agreed.

28:43.956 --> 28:46.492
Now the order's
been given.

28:46.592 --> 28:48.194
Heed it!

28:54.834 --> 28:57.536
( man whistles )

28:57.636 --> 28:59.872
Man:
Captain!

29:17.123 --> 29:18.958
I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.527
It was staring us
right in the face.

29:21.627 --> 29:25.264
Those cannons aren't
the only thing Bryson has
locked down there with him.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.169
38 slaves.

29:30.269 --> 29:33.739
You think they put that flag
there as a signal to us?

29:33.840 --> 29:35.507
Well, it wasn't there
three hours ago.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.910
And if not us, I couldn't
tell you who they are
trying to signal.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.979
Seven, eight...

29:40.079 --> 29:42.348
nine priced over £100.

29:42.448 --> 29:45.384
That's nine strong men
ready to fight Bryson
from below.

29:45.484 --> 29:48.054
Yeah, well, you're presuming
those nine men

29:48.154 --> 29:50.189
will choose to take up arms
and join in a fight

29:50.289 --> 29:52.825
they couldn't possibly know
or care less about.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.493
Given their
current situation,

29:54.593 --> 29:56.963
my presumption
is that there are no
nine men on earth

29:57.063 --> 29:59.465
who wouldn't jump
at the chance for
a little fight.

29:59.565 --> 30:02.869
What, you got
a better idea?

30:04.570 --> 30:07.206
Well, how do you imagine we get
them out of their chains?

30:16.883 --> 30:19.085
Woman:
You will never
see them again.

30:19.185 --> 30:21.287
What?

30:22.889 --> 30:25.124
This person you'd give
your life to protect,

30:25.224 --> 30:28.227
give our lives
to protect...

30:30.062 --> 30:32.764
whoever they are,
you'll never see them again.

30:32.865 --> 30:35.501
You must love them
very much,

30:35.601 --> 30:37.636
but I do not think you
have thought this through.

30:37.736 --> 30:39.371
You don't know me.

30:39.471 --> 30:42.208
And you don't know
what you're talking about.

30:42.308 --> 30:44.843
I know that if we reach
our destination,

30:44.944 --> 30:46.845
we may never have another
chance like this.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.614
There is no way.

30:50.449 --> 30:53.886
You and I,
we are both in this hold,

30:53.986 --> 30:56.488
but we are not
in the same place.

30:58.590 --> 31:01.027
How many times must you
have told yourself

31:01.127 --> 31:03.462
that you're special?

31:03.562 --> 31:07.433
That your master
thinks you're different
from the rest?

31:08.734 --> 31:10.269
Maybe you're right.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.804
But I know those men above
better than you.

31:12.905 --> 31:15.574
And when they put you
in these,

31:15.674 --> 31:18.210
they don't mean
to let you go.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.681
You have a chance
to go home again,

31:22.781 --> 31:24.450
yet you just sit there.

31:26.152 --> 31:28.020
Maybe you're right.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.958
You and I
are not the same.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.002
( thumps )

31:47.974 --> 31:50.276
( clanks )

31:52.044 --> 31:54.146
( hisses )

32:04.823 --> 32:07.326
( door opens )

32:10.296 --> 32:12.965
What the fuck
is going on down here?

32:26.445 --> 32:28.847
Sir.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.549
It's this one.

32:49.701 --> 32:52.138
( choking )

33:15.727 --> 33:19.065
( panting )

33:26.372 --> 33:29.241
( rhythmic thudding )

33:31.943 --> 33:34.280
Men:
Heave!

33:34.380 --> 33:37.383
- Man: Together, lads.
And...
- Heave.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.819
What do they think
they're doing?

33:40.919 --> 33:43.522
( thudding continues )

33:52.464 --> 33:53.532
Come.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.707
- Heave!
- Man: Again!

34:03.675 --> 34:05.677
- ( clangs )
- Heave!

34:14.753 --> 34:16.487
Put your back in it, boys!

34:17.656 --> 34:20.126
( rhythmic thudding
continues )

34:29.301 --> 34:32.070
Secure the hold, Mr. Hayes.
Something's wrong.

34:32.170 --> 34:34.106
( whistles )

34:40.646 --> 34:42.714
( shouting )

34:49.054 --> 34:51.190
( gunshots )

35:13.011 --> 35:14.613
- ( gunshot )
- ( groans )

35:18.917 --> 35:21.220
( shouting )

35:22.221 --> 35:24.390
( grunting )

35:33.599 --> 35:35.434
( grunts )

35:45.811 --> 35:47.213
( shouts )

36:15.341 --> 36:17.409
( urinating )

36:21.347 --> 36:24.950
Excuse me.
Mr. Hamund?

36:25.050 --> 36:26.385
Who the fuck are you?

36:26.485 --> 36:29.288
My name is John Silver.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.323
And I have
a proposition for you.

36:31.423 --> 36:33.191
I've heard your crew has
been freed to hunt again.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.026
And I understand with
Mr. Rackham out of favor,

36:35.126 --> 36:36.628
you're the man the crew
now looks to.

36:39.398 --> 36:41.667
Seems our paths were meant
to meet in this moment.

36:41.767 --> 36:44.670
Me with something to sell,
and you with means to use it.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.938
Piss off.

36:50.075 --> 36:52.544
I was the whore's partner,

36:52.644 --> 36:54.680
the one who stole
the page from Flint

36:54.780 --> 36:57.215
and then tried
to sell it to you.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.685
You're that new one.

36:59.785 --> 37:02.153
- The cook they took on.
- That I am.

37:02.254 --> 37:03.589
But perhaps not for long.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.857
This is where I think you
and I can help each other.

37:07.993 --> 37:11.630
The night the exchange
was meant to take place
at the wrecks,

37:11.730 --> 37:13.965
I lost the schedule
to Captain Flint.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.735
But I escaped
with my hide intact

37:16.835 --> 37:18.504
and my anonymity.

37:18.604 --> 37:20.238
I've remained
with the crew since then,

37:20.339 --> 37:23.108
but I believe now
I've tempted fate
long enough.

37:23.208 --> 37:25.110
Flint departed,
I remained.

37:25.210 --> 37:26.945
My intent--
to sell the page again

37:27.045 --> 37:29.648
and leave Nassau with
something to show for it.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.351
Seeing as we theoretically
already had a deal,

37:32.451 --> 37:34.886
I thought your crew was
the logical place to start.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.324
What the fuck
are you talking about?

37:38.424 --> 37:40.392
You just said Flint
has the schedule.

37:40.492 --> 37:43.261
He has the page
the schedule is written on,

37:43.362 --> 37:45.531
but I saw that page.

37:45.631 --> 37:48.133
I think there's a good chance
I can remember most of it.

37:48.233 --> 37:49.868
For the right price.

37:49.968 --> 37:52.404
Are you a fucking lunatic?

37:52.504 --> 37:54.340
What's to stop me
from killing you

37:54.440 --> 37:56.141
for getting us
into this mess?

37:56.241 --> 37:57.876
Wait.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.546
I am willing to give
a steep discount on our
original agreement.

38:00.646 --> 38:04.616
We don't have any fucking
money left, you shit.

38:04.716 --> 38:07.886
Rackham lost it
chasing you.

38:09.355 --> 38:11.957
I fail to see
how that's possible.

38:20.165 --> 38:23.301
Mr. Hamund.
May I help you?

38:23.402 --> 38:26.805
You told us you lost
our pearls in the wrecks.

38:26.905 --> 38:30.175
5,000 pesos worth.
Isn't that right?

38:30.275 --> 38:31.877
Yes.

38:31.977 --> 38:35.481
Because now I'm told
that you gave half our pearls

38:35.581 --> 38:37.449
to the whore up front

38:37.549 --> 38:40.419
before you ever
left for the wrecks.

38:45.757 --> 38:50.095
Which would mean
that half the pearls
never went to the wrecks.

38:53.198 --> 38:56.768
They was on the whore
when your bitch reeled her in.

38:58.504 --> 39:01.373
Leaving us to wonder

39:01.473 --> 39:03.542
where the fuck
are they now?

39:06.044 --> 39:08.313
I don't know where you're
getting your information from,

39:08.414 --> 39:09.781
but I can assure you,
it is mistaken.

39:09.881 --> 39:12.217
She threw that whore
in the tent

39:12.317 --> 39:14.453
long before we got to her.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.788
Yes, but the whore
had no pearls.

39:16.888 --> 39:20.191
Neither I nor Miss Bonny
would be so stupid as to
steal from you.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.861
And even if I were, I would
certainly never be so stupid

39:22.961 --> 39:24.863
as to trust a whore
to act as escrow.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.198
Someone is lying to you.

39:27.298 --> 39:30.402
If you tell me who it was,
I might be able to help you
figure out why.

39:32.337 --> 39:35.240
I'd tell you, Jack...

39:35.340 --> 39:38.209
but I don't see
how that much matters

39:38.309 --> 39:41.046
seeing that we found these

39:41.146 --> 39:44.015
in your tent just now.

39:46.317 --> 39:49.154
Look at you now.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.158
Where's the fucking
rest of them?

39:54.292 --> 39:56.762
Buried.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.497
By the wrecks.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.601
Darling.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.936
I'm so very
disappointed in you.

40:25.457 --> 40:27.793
I believe
I'm entitled to this.

40:33.499 --> 40:36.034
I've arranged
a room for you.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.136
I don't imagine I'll be
doing much sleeping

40:38.236 --> 40:41.439
till I know this is finished,
thank you very much.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.842
Thought I'd wait it out here,
if you don't mind.

40:51.082 --> 40:52.951
- Men: Heave ho!
- Pull!

40:53.051 --> 40:55.654
Come on!
That's it!

40:55.754 --> 40:57.989
Heave!

40:58.089 --> 41:00.191
Man:
All right, lads,
coming over.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.693
Man #2:
Coming over.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.261
Man #3:
Okay, that's good.

41:03.361 --> 41:06.164
( shouting continues )

41:09.735 --> 41:12.671
I certainly didn't expect
to find you down in the hold.

41:14.039 --> 41:17.208
Not after you betrayed
Miss Guthrie on behalf
of her father.

41:20.145 --> 41:24.115
Our agreement was I would
stay behind to protect
Eleanor from you.

41:24.215 --> 41:26.084
( scoffs )

41:26.184 --> 41:29.320
You think what
she and I hope to achieve

41:29.420 --> 41:31.857
for Nassau is impossible.

41:31.957 --> 41:33.825
That I'll be
the death of her?

41:40.065 --> 41:43.034
I lost six men
chasing down this ship.

41:43.134 --> 41:45.971
Nearly faced another mutiny
all over again.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.308
If I had any sense,
I'd throw you to my crew.

41:50.408 --> 41:53.011
Take the pressure off me.

41:55.146 --> 41:56.281
But I'm not gonna do that.

41:59.818 --> 42:01.820
I'd rather prove you wrong.

42:24.509 --> 42:25.977
Billy.

42:28.546 --> 42:29.915
Stow the guns
in the lower hold.

42:30.015 --> 42:32.517
- Favor the starboard.
- Of course.

42:32.618 --> 42:34.686
Right, Billy.

42:38.890 --> 42:41.927
What?
Afraid I got loose lips?

42:45.363 --> 42:47.532
Please, son,
I am on your side.

42:47.633 --> 42:49.567
You've got to believe that.

42:49.668 --> 42:52.604
Then get some answers.

42:58.043 --> 43:00.278
Man:
Come on!

43:00.378 --> 43:03.481
- Heave!
- Crew: Heave ho.

43:03.581 --> 43:06.217
That's it.
Hold on.

43:09.855 --> 43:11.089
Lend a hand, mate.

43:11.189 --> 43:13.024
Perfectly good
stash of powder here.

43:16.027 --> 43:17.829
( screams )

43:23.268 --> 43:25.303
- ( men shouting, screaming )
- ( coughs )

43:29.174 --> 43:31.242
You all right?

43:36.014 --> 43:37.548
She saw us.

43:37.649 --> 43:39.985
The Scarborough
had to have seen us.

43:42.220 --> 43:44.389
There's still
great guns in the hold.

43:44.489 --> 43:46.391
At least three
or four more.

43:46.491 --> 43:48.326
There's no time
for delay.

43:48.426 --> 43:50.862
The guns we've unloaded
already will have to suffice.

43:50.962 --> 43:53.665
Cut us loose!
We're getting out of here.

43:53.765 --> 43:56.201
( men shouting )

44:07.713 --> 44:09.314
Man:
Come on!

44:23.561 --> 44:25.430
What the hell is that?

44:26.965 --> 44:29.167
It's the Andromache's
spritsail brace.

44:29.267 --> 44:31.069
It must have blown loose
during the explosion.

44:31.169 --> 44:33.905
That's two knots or more
it'll drag us down.

44:53.792 --> 44:57.562
Earlier...

44:57.662 --> 44:59.765
when you and Mr. Gates
were having words,

44:59.865 --> 45:02.000
you mentioned a letter.

45:04.669 --> 45:06.204
What was in it, Billy?

45:16.547 --> 45:18.616
Billy!

45:18.716 --> 45:20.485
What was in it?

45:23.922 --> 45:27.192
I think you know
what was in it.

45:28.760 --> 45:31.029
( cannon fire )

45:32.330 --> 45:33.899
Oh, shit!

45:36.734 --> 45:40.471
( men shouting,
screaming )

45:40.571 --> 45:42.974
Hard to starboard.
Bring us about.

45:48.579 --> 45:50.748
Man overboard!

45:50.849 --> 45:54.385
Man:
Man overboard!

45:56.054 --> 45:58.957
It's Billy.
He fell.

46:00.691 --> 46:03.128
- Billy!
- Billy!

46:03.228 --> 46:05.130
Any sign of him?

46:13.872 --> 46:15.841
We can't turn back.

46:20.545 --> 46:22.881
She'll tear us to pieces.

46:50.942 --> 46:52.377
Ambush, I presume.

46:52.477 --> 46:56.147
Nothing out there but men
with pistols and swords.

46:56.247 --> 46:59.117
I imagine those pearls
didn't just materialize
out of thin air.

46:59.217 --> 47:00.818
With whom did you
scheme this?

47:00.919 --> 47:02.653
The cunt.

47:02.753 --> 47:04.422
( scoffs )

47:04.522 --> 47:06.824
Somehow I'm not surprised.

47:08.894 --> 47:10.761
Decent fellow, Slade,
as far as I know.

47:10.862 --> 47:12.630
Never raised a hand
against the whore.

47:12.730 --> 47:15.133
A factor I hope
you considered before
you decided that he

47:15.233 --> 47:17.802
and six other men
who stood by our captain
in his darkest hour,

47:17.903 --> 47:19.704
men he considers
his brothers,

47:19.804 --> 47:23.074
be lumped into the cost
of assuaging your offense
in this matter.

47:24.375 --> 47:26.044
God damn it, Anne.

47:26.144 --> 47:28.346
Do I not deserve
a say about this?

47:30.381 --> 47:32.450
You had your say.

47:32.550 --> 47:34.552
Now I'll have mine.

47:52.670 --> 47:54.940
This way.

48:07.752 --> 48:10.021
( bird screeching )

48:22.100 --> 48:24.535
You know,
when I first met you,

48:24.635 --> 48:27.205
I pegged you
for an easy mark.

48:28.839 --> 48:31.142
But now,
between you and Flint,

48:31.242 --> 48:33.411
I'm not certain who
I should be more afraid of.

48:38.716 --> 48:40.651
I saw you earlier.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.988
After you lifted the ban.

48:46.391 --> 48:49.961
( chuckles )
You were angry.

48:50.962 --> 48:53.164
Not just about Max.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.935
Those men out there,

48:58.036 --> 49:00.038
they made you admit
you were wrong.

49:01.072 --> 49:02.307
They made you feel weak.

49:06.611 --> 49:08.913
I think you felt compelled

49:09.014 --> 49:11.682
to let everyone
on this island know

49:11.782 --> 49:14.952
that in this place,

49:15.053 --> 49:18.556
no one fucks with you
and gets away with it.

49:18.656 --> 49:21.392
( screams )

49:28.833 --> 49:31.202
( groaning )

49:34.639 --> 49:37.208
( panting )

49:40.045 --> 49:41.179
( knocks )

49:50.455 --> 49:52.757
( door closes )

50:17.982 --> 50:19.917
Thank you

50:20.017 --> 50:22.287
for what you did for me.

50:28.893 --> 50:31.229
I didn't do it for you.

51:15.740 --> 51:18.243
Dufresne:
Old Jim Carver.

51:26.751 --> 51:29.287
Sebastian Frakes.

51:39.330 --> 51:42.367
William "Bones" Manderly.

51:43.834 --> 51:44.869
Men:
Huzzah!

52:22.039 --> 52:23.708
I hope you're pleased
with yourself.

52:26.911 --> 52:29.347
I see. We won't be speaking
of this again, I presume.

52:30.981 --> 52:33.518
Well, before we close
the lid on this and put
it in the ground,

52:33.618 --> 52:35.253
one last question
if you will,

52:35.353 --> 52:37.222
just to satisfy
my curiosity.

52:40.591 --> 52:43.027
When you
and Miss Guthrie were
plotting this little coup,

52:43.127 --> 52:45.663
when she asked you,
"Well, shit, Anne,

52:45.763 --> 52:48.132
what makes you think
old Jack will go along
with this plan of ours

52:48.233 --> 52:49.567
and not plead
the truth to his men

52:49.667 --> 52:52.203
as he's most certainly going
to feel duty-bound to do?"

52:52.303 --> 52:55.273
What did you say?

52:55.373 --> 52:58.409
I told her given the choice
between them and me...

53:00.177 --> 53:01.612
you'd choose me.

53:03.381 --> 53:05.250
That's very
fucking touching.

53:08.319 --> 53:09.754
And the captain?

53:09.854 --> 53:12.156
The two of you come up
with some idea how
to deal with him

53:12.257 --> 53:13.958
when he returns and finds out
about all this?

53:16.126 --> 53:18.796
You don't know
where he's gone, do you?

53:23.200 --> 53:24.835
He ain't coming back.

54:09.079 --> 54:12.249
( instrumental music
playing )
