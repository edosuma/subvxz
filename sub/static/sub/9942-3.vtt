Now nobody's saying the Chatsworth Estate
is the Garden of Eden,

00:06.290 --> 00:08.565
but it's been a good home to us, to me,

00:08.610 --> 00:13.400
Frank Gallagher, and me kids who
l'm proud of, cos every single one of 'em

00:13.450 --> 00:16.408
reminds me a little of me.

00:16.450 --> 00:22.127
They can all think for themselves,
which they've got me to thank for.

00:22.170 --> 00:25.799
Lip, who's a bit of a gobshite, which is why
nobody calls him Phillip any more.

00:25.850 --> 00:30.162
lan, a lot like his mam, which is handy for
the others cos she's disappeared into thin air.

00:30.210 --> 00:34.442
And Carl. We daren't let him
grow his hair for two reasons -

00:34.490 --> 00:38.005
it makes it stand on end and makes him
look like Toyah, and nits love him.

00:38.050 --> 00:41.122
Debbie - sent by God, total angel.

00:41.170 --> 00:44.162
You've to check your change
but she'll go miles out of her way

00:44.210 --> 00:45.882
to do you a favour,

00:45.930 --> 00:48.649
plus lickle Liam,
who's gonna be a star some day.

00:48.690 --> 00:54.322
Sheila, me bird, couldn't be happier.
One plate short of a full set, like.

00:54.370 --> 00:57.521
And fantastic neighbours Kev
and Veronica - lend ya anything,

00:57.570 --> 00:58.923
well, almost anything.

00:58.970 --> 01:03.600
Carol and Marty - the lodgers from hell.
Last of the lonely hearts

01:03.650 --> 01:06.722
and a psychologist's wet dream.
Still, nobody's perfect.

01:06.770 --> 01:11.127
But all of 'em to a man
know first and foremost

01:11.170 --> 01:16.369
one of the most vital necessities in life
is they know how to throw a party!

01:16.410 --> 01:17.399
Heh, heh, heh, scatter!

01:17.450 --> 01:20.726
(Lip) 'Sometimes things you do lead
somewhere, other times

01:20.770 --> 01:23.364
'they are just an end in themselves.

01:23.410 --> 01:25.128
'Trouble is you never know.

01:25.170 --> 01:29.641
'Me and lan, we're both young
free and single. No baggage, right?

01:29.690 --> 01:31.521
'Free to move on, except sometimes

01:31.570 --> 01:35.688
'the past comes back at you that
fast you can't get out the way.'

01:35.730 --> 01:38.164
Boys will be boys

01:40.610 --> 01:45.161
There's been girls
that have stolen our hearts

01:47.090 --> 01:50.082
But their arms simply
couldn't be prized apart...

'Ciggies.'

02:19.210 --> 02:22.043

Well, you know the only
thing l learnt at school?

02:37.330 --> 02:43.485
Don't kick against the pricks.
O-level fucking conformity.

One bloke in the end.

No, sorry love,

04:15.770 --> 04:18.204
This is in Gorton.
You're in Chatsworth.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.127
So you don't have a
band playing here at all?

04:20.170 --> 04:21.603
No.

04:21.649 --> 04:25.484
You're not missing much. l saw them
in Salford. They're shite.

04:25.530 --> 04:29.318
l know. My mate fancies the drummer.
l only came as her alibi.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.406
Her folks are a bit strict.

04:31.450 --> 04:33.441
They think she's at my house, revising.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.082
Well, could be fate.

04:35.130 --> 04:36.609
Do you want another drink?

04:36.650 --> 04:37.719
Yeah. Why not?

04:37.770 --> 04:40.842
Two glasses of white wine, please.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.361
Come on then. Let's go into town.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.765
Hang on, l'm just having a drink.
This is Lip.

- All right.
(Girl) He's bought you one.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.369
Here you go.

We've been through this.

Really?

05:06.810 --> 05:08.607
Really.

05:08.650 --> 05:11.562
So, l'll just get my things
and l'm off.

05:12.970 --> 05:14.085
Good night.

05:15.770 --> 05:17.283
Bit moody, isn't she? Your mate.

05:17.330 --> 05:20.959
Yeah, well, she's spoiled.
Her Dad's loaded.

05:21.010 --> 05:22.602
She doesn't like it when she's
not the centre of attention.

05:22.650 --> 05:25.801
She's getting some attention now.

05:25.850 --> 05:28.887
l tell you, the lads in this pub - predatory!

05:31.090 --> 05:32.648
l best make a move.

05:34.210 --> 05:35.609
That's a shame.

05:35.650 --> 05:38.528
l was going to invite you
round for coffee.

05:38.570 --> 05:42.245
What? l've only just met you and
you think l'd come round your house?

05:42.290 --> 05:43.609
At this time of night?

05:43.650 --> 05:46.118
l'll get my coat.

BANGlNG AND SQUEAKlNG

lt's Pimp My Ride - what you doing?

06:12.810 --> 06:14.038
What's that noise?

06:16.570 --> 06:18.606
Sue and Marty shagging?

06:18.650 --> 06:20.129
Carl!

06:20.170 --> 06:22.559
Can't we listen?

06:22.610 --> 06:24.919
Gross.

06:24.970 --> 06:28.883
Hiya. Debbie, Carl.

06:28.930 --> 06:33.367
- This is...a friend of mine.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

06:33.410 --> 06:34.763
Do you want a coffee?

06:34.810 --> 06:36.641
No. Not really.

06:36.690 --> 06:39.079
Right.

06:39.130 --> 06:41.963
Well, we're just gonna
pop upstairs for a bit.

06:47.610 --> 06:50.568
Do you ever think of
anything apart from sex?

06:50.610 --> 06:52.123
Yeah.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.398
Girls.

06:53.450 --> 06:56.089
GROANlNG

06:59.130 --> 07:01.360
Come on, love. l'm closing up now.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.808
Come on.

07:08.370 --> 07:11.601
Ahh, for fuck's sake!

07:13.250 --> 07:14.478
These are brand-new.

08:12.850 --> 08:15.364
- How did you get like this?
- l don't know.

08:15.410 --> 08:18.641
Come on. lt's all right, it's all right, come on.

08:18.690 --> 08:20.487
lt was good of you to phone us.

08:20.530 --> 08:24.239
lt's all right. l couldn't have
her getting in a cab in that state.

08:24.290 --> 08:26.246
l can't understand what's happened.

08:26.290 --> 08:28.850
How'd she get like this?
Somebody spike her drink?

08:28.890 --> 08:32.006
Eh. Whoa. Nothing like that
goes on here, mate.

08:32.049 --> 08:34.041
No, no, l'm sure. lt's just er...

08:34.090 --> 08:36.842
l don't think she's ever
been in a pub before.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.562
Oh, right.

08:38.610 --> 08:41.522
She's probably just not
used to it then. Kids, eh?

08:41.570 --> 08:45.768
Me and the wife
really appreciate this.

08:45.810 --> 08:52.249
lf you fancy a bet, l've got a
little filly won't let you down.

08:52.290 --> 08:54.440
Only, keep it to yourself.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.367
l don't want people getting suspicious.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.446
Why would they?

08:58.490 --> 09:02.165
Because take it from me -
this horse has already won.

09:02.210 --> 09:03.962
Yeah, right.

09:04.010 --> 09:08.561
Hey. l'm a man of my word and l
don't give out these tips to anyone.

09:08.610 --> 09:14.606
lf you don't believe me, check out
the first race at York tomorrow.

09:14.650 --> 09:17.642
The favourite'll pull up lame.

09:17.690 --> 09:20.488
l think the world of my daughter, mate.

09:20.530 --> 09:22.202
You do yourself a favour.

09:35.370 --> 09:38.089
Morning, Debs. Tea?

09:38.130 --> 09:40.041
Yeah, please.

09:46.090 --> 09:49.048
l was just, er...checking
the weather. Raining like fuck!

09:49.090 --> 09:51.365
You know how tight
things are in this house?

09:51.410 --> 09:54.208
lf someone's living here,
they should pay their whack.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.889
Right, fine. l totally agree with ya.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.682
Did Sue really go home last night?

10:01.450 --> 10:02.929
Scream, you bitch!

10:06.450 --> 10:08.406
Yes. Yes. No! Yes she did.

10:14.410 --> 10:15.923
Oh. Oh.

10:15.970 --> 10:19.519
There you go.

10:19.570 --> 10:22.323
(Frank) What's up with you?

10:22.370 --> 10:23.928
Post.

10:23.970 --> 10:28.327
''Want to change your gas supplier?''
Deckchairs on the Titanic.

10:28.370 --> 10:30.201
This one's from Auntie Pat.

10:32.050 --> 10:35.087
Oh, it's Beryl and Aidan.

10:35.130 --> 10:36.643
Who are they?

10:36.690 --> 10:42.003
Haven't got a clue, but they send
every year, Christmas and...birthdays.

10:48.010 --> 10:49.489
Shite.

10:51.210 --> 10:57.206
Should have some cards here.
Come on, help us out here lads.

10:57.250 --> 11:01.562
Oh. Have l seen something
l shouldn't have?

11:01.610 --> 11:03.680
No, no... Nothing.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.004
What have you got there?

11:05.050 --> 11:06.961
No really. lt's nothing.

11:07.010 --> 11:09.285
You can't fool me, Frank Gallagher.

11:09.330 --> 11:12.447
Pretending you've forgotten
when you haven't.

11:12.490 --> 11:16.199
Oh, well, never mind, you can
give it me tonight in the pub.

11:16.250 --> 11:18.525

Sherlock Holmes and Watson.

11:26.730 --> 11:27.799
(Sue) Hiya.

11:27.850 --> 11:29.408
Hiya, love. You all right?

11:29.450 --> 11:31.520
Couple of scratch cards, please.

11:31.570 --> 11:34.243
All right Mandy?
Not long to go, eh?

11:34.290 --> 11:37.202
No. Only a couple of weeks.
l feel like l'm walking round

11:37.250 --> 11:39.480
with a Christmas turkey
jammed up my muff.

11:39.530 --> 11:41.919
Oi, son. No hoods in't shop, please.

11:41.970 --> 11:46.202

11:47.730 --> 11:49.846
Oi! NO!

11:54.130 --> 11:57.918
You little shit. Get off you
little wanker - that's my bag.

11:57.970 --> 11:59.926
Ey! Ey!

11:59.970 --> 12:01.198
Shit. Aw.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.844
l don't believe that.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.767
Five times in two months.

12:05.810 --> 12:07.687
Are you all right Mandy, love?

12:07.730 --> 12:09.482
l think my waters have broken.

12:11.090 --> 12:13.445
Ooh, yeah.

12:21.410 --> 12:24.322
Lip. They've robbed the shop.

12:24.370 --> 12:25.849
Mandy Maguire's been
taken to hospital.

12:25.890 --> 12:27.084
Shit.

12:27.130 --> 12:29.928
She's been taken
off in an ambulance.

12:29.970 --> 12:31.289
What you doing?

12:31.330 --> 12:32.319
Really sorry.

12:32.370 --> 12:34.565
No, where you going?

12:38.210 --> 12:41.327
He's gone to see Mandy.

12:41.370 --> 12:43.486
She's having his baby.

12:46.890 --> 12:51.008
lf l give you a fiver, will you fuck off
and leave me alone?

12:57.970 --> 13:00.359
Red car. ls that the name of the horse?

13:00.410 --> 13:02.082
That's the race track, innit!

13:02.130 --> 13:03.324
All right, all right.

13:03.370 --> 13:07.682
Here we go. Rat Pack, 3. 10,
Redcar, Saturday.

13:07.730 --> 13:09.482
Right. How much have we got in the jar?

13:09.530 --> 13:10.758
Er, no you don't. We've got bills.

13:10.810 --> 13:12.323
But this geezer claims it's a dead cert.

13:12.370 --> 13:15.362
Oh, dead cert? According to some
knobhead you met at last orders.

13:15.410 --> 13:17.605
He wasn't a knobhead.
He was wearing a suit.

13:17.650 --> 13:19.606
Oh, all right then,
some knobhead in a suit.

13:19.650 --> 13:21.368
Don't mean he can see
into the future.

13:21.410 --> 13:22.399
Come on, Vee.

13:22.450 --> 13:24.918
We could paper the walls
with dead certs from the boozer.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.245
Everyone there
thinks they're John McCririck.

13:27.290 --> 13:30.646
l know but there was something
about him that just seemed different,

13:30.690 --> 13:32.328
that's all.

13:32.370 --> 13:35.521
lf you wanna waste a tenner,
fine but that's it.

13:35.570 --> 13:37.606
Fuck's sake...
Where's your sense of adventure?

13:37.650 --> 13:40.164
You don't need a sense of
adventure living here.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.804
ln fact, Kev, that's
the last fucking thing you need.

13:45.410 --> 13:46.889
Oi!

13:51.530 --> 13:53.407
No, you listen to me.

13:53.450 --> 13:56.567
My daughter gets the best
treatment that money can buy.

13:56.610 --> 13:58.407
Don't give me any of this NHS shite.

13:58.450 --> 14:00.281
You've got to help me.
That girl over there

14:00.330 --> 14:02.048
is pregnant with my baby.
That's her Dad.

14:02.090 --> 14:04.046
lf he sees me, l'm dead.

14:04.090 --> 14:05.079
Fine.

14:05.130 --> 14:08.088
What the fuck are you doing here,
Gallagher?

14:08.130 --> 14:10.883
Do you mind?
l'm here to see my cousin.

14:10.930 --> 14:12.761
We're trying to have
a private family conversation.

14:12.810 --> 14:13.799
Really?

14:13.850 --> 14:18.366
Sorry, love. l got here as
quick as l could. Who are these?

14:18.410 --> 14:21.686
This is Philip ''Shagger'' Gallagher.
Your wife's cousin.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.209
Cousin?

14:23.250 --> 14:24.683
Yeah, you don't recognise him?

14:24.730 --> 14:27.767
You haven't got any cousins.
Wait a minute, you filthy little bitch.

14:27.810 --> 14:29.607
- No.
- This is him, innit?

14:29.650 --> 14:32.528
- Listen...
- Whoa, you little scumbag.

14:32.570 --> 14:35.323
You little shite. You stay away
from my daughter and her baby.

14:35.370 --> 14:37.122
Baby.

14:39.290 --> 14:41.326
Baby.

14:41.370 --> 14:43.326
BABY GURGLES

14:50.290 --> 14:52.042
Baby.

14:54.330 --> 14:55.649
l've had a baby.

15:04.050 --> 15:06.689
No, no. lt's lovely, Frank, really.

15:06.730 --> 15:09.483
l am sorry about your present, love.

15:09.530 --> 15:11.521
God, l wanted fucking smack 'em.

15:11.570 --> 15:13.367
Had to hold myself back, you know.

15:13.410 --> 15:15.605
But these people,
they've got no scruples.

15:15.650 --> 15:19.199
They just see human life
as a disposable item.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.763
Oh, well.

15:20.810 --> 15:23.483
At least you're safe.
That's the main thing.

15:23.530 --> 15:26.442
l just thought, you know...
But who am l to say?

15:26.490 --> 15:28.765
Don't fret, Sheila.

15:28.810 --> 15:31.085
You'll have something.

15:31.130 --> 15:38.241
Something special, you know.
l just to need to get it sorted.

15:38.290 --> 15:40.201
What's for dinner?

15:40.250 --> 15:42.241
l made you a shepherd's pie. l, erm...

15:42.290 --> 15:45.805
l forgot to defrost it.
You'll have to sort it out yourself.

15:47.450 --> 15:49.042
Meself?

15:50.650 --> 15:53.244
l did what l could, you know.
l had a pop.

15:53.290 --> 15:55.281
But these little...tossers.

15:55.330 --> 15:59.403
Little kids, with big knives,
fucking Seven Samurai.

15:59.450 --> 16:02.840
Make Poverty History, yeah?

16:02.890 --> 16:05.165
Just let 'em all machete
each other to death.

16:05.210 --> 16:07.360
Job done, thank you,
Gordon fucking Brown.

16:07.410 --> 16:08.445
Frank, hang on a minute.

16:08.490 --> 16:11.641
Jez, have you got another packet of crisps?
l'm starving here.

16:11.690 --> 16:13.646
(Commentator) 'And news from the paddock.
lt's a worrying development...'

16:13.690 --> 16:16.079
Frank, shut it.

16:16.130 --> 16:19.281
'News coming in, and it's a turn up,
Rockin' Robin, the hot favourite,

16:19.330 --> 16:22.879
'has pulled up lame in the paddock
just ten minutes before the off.'

16:22.930 --> 16:25.524
Check out the first race
at York tomorrow.

16:25.570 --> 16:29.006
The favourite will pull up lame.

16:29.050 --> 16:30.608
Fuck me.

16:30.650 --> 16:33.403
See that's the problem...

16:33.450 --> 16:36.567
l'm fucking talking to you.

16:36.610 --> 16:38.407
We'll sell the car.

16:38.450 --> 16:39.849
The car? We only just got it.

16:39.890 --> 16:41.846
lt's the most valuable thing we've got.

16:41.890 --> 16:43.881
We don't just wanna put
a few quid on, do we?

16:43.930 --> 16:46.000
lt's one extreme
to the other with you, innit?

16:46.050 --> 16:48.484
The bet's for real.
The horse pulled up lame

16:48.530 --> 16:51.920
just like he said.
lt was definitely the right horse?

16:51.970 --> 16:53.039
First race at York, favourite.

16:53.090 --> 16:55.888
And this Rat Pack, it's nine to one?

16:55.930 --> 16:57.283
That's what it said in the paper.

16:57.330 --> 17:00.845
Oh, Kev. Just think what
we can do with all that money.

17:00.890 --> 17:02.608
Right, we'll get all the cash together

17:02.650 --> 17:06.529
we can and we'll put it all on. Agreed?

17:06.569 --> 17:07.763
Agreed.

17:07.810 --> 17:12.361
Oh, Vee, remember main thing,
mum's the word, all right?

17:12.410 --> 17:14.401
l promised that bloke
l wouldn't tell anyone.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.917
And we don't want the odds
getting fucked up.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.608
l haven't.

17:20.170 --> 17:21.522
And we're off.

17:24.089 --> 17:28.242
Nah, sorry mate, not interested.
Not much demand for these.

17:28.290 --> 17:29.769
No demand? When you sold it us

17:29.810 --> 17:32.040
a few weeks ago, you said
they were selling like hotcakes.

17:32.090 --> 17:34.809
That was weeks ago.
The market's up and down, innit?

17:34.850 --> 17:36.078
Waggy, come on.

17:36.130 --> 17:38.439
l'll tell you what l'll do,
l'll give you 200 for it,

17:38.490 --> 17:42.039
if you give me
the name of this horse.

17:46.730 --> 17:48.288
You robbing bastard!

17:49.530 --> 17:50.758
l'll give you a tenner.

17:50.810 --> 17:53.404
A tenner? Are you taking the piss?

17:53.450 --> 17:56.522
Well, 50...

17:56.570 --> 17:59.960
if you tell us the name of this horse.

18:00.010 --> 18:01.489
Fucking hell!

18:07.250 --> 18:10.401
l told you. We have to keep quiet
about this, Vee.

18:10.450 --> 18:14.125
l did! l haven't told anyone.

18:16.770 --> 18:18.283
l did mention it to me mam.

18:18.330 --> 18:21.845
Oh, was that before or after you
took a double page ad out in

18:21.890 --> 18:23.482
the Evening News?

18:23.530 --> 18:25.964
l didn't tell her the name of the horse.

18:26.010 --> 18:28.046
Look, l'm sorry.

18:28.090 --> 18:32.641
lt's just...why does our life
have to be so shit?

18:32.690 --> 18:38.242
Hang on. lt wasn't shit two days ago
before you got this stupid tip.

18:38.290 --> 18:39.848
SHE SlGHS

18:39.890 --> 18:41.846
Look...

18:45.970 --> 18:49.645
Here's 20 quid. Go and put that on.
Bollocks to the catalogue this week.

18:49.690 --> 18:52.284
But, that'll only win us £180.

18:52.330 --> 18:55.402
Well, it's £180 more than we've got now.

18:55.450 --> 18:58.487
We've never had money before
and we've always been happy.

19:00.490 --> 19:04.085
Maybe it's just not meant to be.
Me having money.

19:04.130 --> 19:07.042
So what? You've got me.

19:22.490 --> 19:26.324
Now, actually, Carol,
l wanted to ask you a favour.

19:26.370 --> 19:29.407
The little bastards nicked the
present that l'd bought for Sheila.

19:29.450 --> 19:34.365
Neither a borrower nor
a lender be, Frank. Shakespeare.

19:34.410 --> 19:37.880
Well, he was all right, weren't he?
Had Anne Hathaway's fucking cottage.

19:37.930 --> 19:41.889
Sheila's gone on cookery strike.
Winter of fucking discontent

19:41.930 --> 19:44.728
in me own house. l mean, fucking,
what's it all about, eh?

19:44.770 --> 19:46.442
l'm being punished and for what?

19:46.490 --> 19:49.288
Missing her birthday. And what's that?

19:49.330 --> 19:53.608
Another staging post, another
staging post, another staging post on

19:53.650 --> 19:58.405
the long road to death, to death,
to death, to fucking oblivion.

19:58.450 --> 20:00.281
Change the bloody record, Frank.

20:00.330 --> 20:02.321
Hey listen,

20:02.370 --> 20:04.326
is it true about Kev and this tip?

20:04.370 --> 20:07.203
My lips are sealed but yes, it is.

20:07.250 --> 20:09.445
Oh, eh up, here's Hinge
and fucking Bracket.

20:09.490 --> 20:11.606
Right, listen up, we're investigating

20:11.650 --> 20:14.369
a serious crime that's taken place.

20:14.410 --> 20:15.559
Fuck off.

20:15.610 --> 20:18.682
- Can we have your attention, please?
- Quiet!

20:18.730 --> 20:20.129
(Policeman) Oi!

20:20.170 --> 20:21.649
Quiet!

20:21.690 --> 20:25.000
CROWD QUlETENS DOWN, MUSlC STOPS

20:26.090 --> 20:30.527
That's better.
Now then, l've got some questions.

20:30.570 --> 20:34.961
Excuse me. lf you don't mind.

20:35.010 --> 20:36.841
No.

20:36.890 --> 20:40.166
Right, first things first.

20:41.730 --> 20:44.198
My daughter's been knocked down
and someone's gonna get

20:44.250 --> 20:46.639
a big fucking kicking for it,
l'll tell you that for nothing.

20:46.690 --> 20:48.681
That's not the fucking half of it.

20:48.730 --> 20:53.281
Yeah, cos the stupid little prick
that stole my Mandy's bag

20:53.330 --> 20:56.481
took something else too.

20:56.530 --> 20:58.600
Piece of jewellery.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.447
Belonging to my wife.

21:00.490 --> 21:04.119
Which, let's put it this way,
has great sentimental value.

21:04.170 --> 21:06.365
l want it back.

21:06.410 --> 21:09.447
So, if anybody has any
information about this crime,

21:09.490 --> 21:13.244
l expect them to come and talk to me.

21:13.290 --> 21:14.518
Understood?

21:16.650 --> 21:17.878
You won't find me ungrateful.

21:17.930 --> 21:21.161
lf l could just add, if anybody
does know anything...

21:21.210 --> 21:22.529
MUSlC RESTARTS

21:22.570 --> 21:25.164
..then you can come and see us in
confidence.

21:27.490 --> 21:29.128
All right, Patrick?

21:29.170 --> 21:31.809
l see we have both become grandfathers.

21:31.850 --> 21:35.047
Fuck off, you ugly bastard.
We don't want you anywhere near her.

21:35.090 --> 21:36.318
Large vodka.

21:39.690 --> 21:42.329
l hear you were in this shop?

21:42.370 --> 21:45.168
Oh, no, l didn't see owt.

21:45.210 --> 21:48.566
He just...fucking hood, you know.
Totally covered his face.

21:48.610 --> 21:51.966
Yeah, well don't worry about it.

21:52.010 --> 21:55.525
This is the CCTV video from the shop.

21:55.570 --> 21:57.800
And if l find out from that,

21:57.850 --> 21:59.920
that you know more than
you're letting on...

21:59.970 --> 22:02.928
l'll wait till it comes out on DVD.

22:02.970 --> 22:06.599
- What was it?
- A bracelet. A charm bracelet.

22:06.650 --> 22:09.687
lt's not worth much, just a few quid, but my
Patrick bought it

22:09.730 --> 22:14.645
for me the first time he come out of
prison, just after we were married.

22:18.690 --> 22:21.648
Every time he did a spell inside,
he'd buy me another charm,

22:21.690 --> 22:26.844
to celebrate his release.
Our Mandy was taking it the menders

22:26.890 --> 22:29.768
and some little cocksucker's stolen it.

22:29.810 --> 22:31.528
Well, trust me,

22:31.570 --> 22:36.200
he'll curse the day he was born
when my boys get hold of him.

22:54.570 --> 22:55.798
ls Mandy in?

23:07.650 --> 23:08.605
Ow.

23:08.650 --> 23:09.639
There?

23:09.690 --> 23:11.567
Staying again tonight, Sue?

23:11.610 --> 23:13.089
Don't start, Debbie.

23:13.130 --> 23:14.324
Just saying.

23:14.370 --> 23:17.646
lf she is, she has to put
something into the kitty.

23:17.690 --> 23:19.248
What is it with you?

23:19.290 --> 23:21.599
l'm not living here.

23:22.770 --> 23:26.160
Take it easy with the fruit.
lt's for the kids.

23:26.210 --> 23:29.282
Yeah, we'd all have scampi,
if it weren't for lan.

23:29.330 --> 23:30.809
(Debbie) Scurvy!

23:30.850 --> 23:31.839
You all right?

23:33.410 --> 23:34.684
What's happened to you?

23:34.730 --> 23:36.686
l think it's the Maguires way of saying,

23:36.730 --> 23:38.448
''Here's a cigar for the new dad.''

23:38.490 --> 23:40.401
Ah. So we're not gonna
get to see her, then?

23:40.450 --> 23:42.964
Put it this way, l won't be holding
my breath for a christening invite.

23:43.010 --> 23:46.241
Maguires'd probably drown you
in the font. lrish psychos.

23:46.290 --> 23:49.600
Oh, well, there's only so many times
they can head butt you.

23:49.650 --> 23:52.005
Yeah, before they kill me.

23:53.010 --> 23:55.968
- What's that?
(lan) Got it today.

23:56.010 --> 23:56.999
Let's have a look.

23:57.050 --> 24:00.201
Hang on, where did you get that?

24:00.250 --> 24:03.686
ln town. l found it, why?

24:03.730 --> 24:06.244
This is mine. lt was in my bag.

24:06.290 --> 24:07.405
lt can't be yours.

24:07.450 --> 24:10.203
lt's mine, l'm telling you. lt was
in my bag that got fucking robbed.

24:10.250 --> 24:13.242
Where did you get it?

24:13.290 --> 24:16.566
l don't know.
Look, l told you, l found it.

24:19.050 --> 24:20.529
Oh, for fuck's sake.

24:30.450 --> 24:32.759
- Fuck off.
- Where did you get it?

24:32.810 --> 24:34.528
lt's none of your business.

24:34.570 --> 24:36.128
Was it you who nicked it?

24:36.170 --> 24:38.206
Of course it wasn't me.
l just got it, all right?

24:38.250 --> 24:40.320
- Who off?
- No-one.

24:40.370 --> 24:42.486
Who off, lan?
l need to find out

24:42.530 --> 24:45.203
who robbed the shop so l can
get back in with the Maguires.

24:47.370 --> 24:49.964
Fucking hell. Look, right,

24:50.010 --> 24:53.525
there's this place l've been to
a couple of times with a mate.

24:53.570 --> 24:56.004
What place?

24:56.050 --> 24:57.802
lt's a cottage, OK.

24:57.850 --> 24:59.442
Cottage? What, like a little
fucking house in the country?

24:59.490 --> 25:02.084
No, a gay cottage.

25:02.130 --> 25:03.358
What? A lav?

25:03.410 --> 25:06.925
lt's just blow jobs and that.
You don't even see 'em half the time.

25:06.970 --> 25:09.609
How come, do it in the dark?

25:09.650 --> 25:12.562
No. There's a hole
in the cubicle wall and you...

25:12.610 --> 25:13.759
Jesus.

25:13.810 --> 25:16.608
And people leave stuff.
You know, in return.

25:16.650 --> 25:17.719
And that's how you got the walkman?

25:17.770 --> 25:20.807
- Yeah. Some guy. l got lucky.
- Who is he?

25:20.850 --> 25:22.203
- l dunno.
- You must know his name.

25:22.250 --> 25:23.888
l don't know his name.
l didn't even see his face.

25:23.930 --> 25:25.886
Fuck...

25:27.570 --> 25:29.606
SlGHS
We're never gonna find him.

25:29.650 --> 25:32.642
l'm never gonna get
to see my daughter.

25:32.690 --> 25:34.760
l said l didn't see his face.

25:36.490 --> 25:38.162
l didn't say l wouldn't recognise him.

26:02.090 --> 26:04.320
Oh, Kev. You bastard.

26:04.370 --> 26:07.282
You horrible bastard.

26:12.010 --> 26:13.921
How much did it fetch, my ring?

26:13.970 --> 26:17.201
Were you gonna go to the pawn shop
Monday, and buy it back?

26:17.250 --> 26:18.478
Hey, Vee.

26:22.490 --> 26:25.800
l'm sorry, l was desperate.

26:25.850 --> 26:28.444
l wasn't thinking straight.

26:28.490 --> 26:31.209
This is our big chance.

26:31.250 --> 26:32.729
l just really wanted to...

26:36.250 --> 26:39.401
l'd never pawn your wedding ring,
you know l wouldn't.

26:39.450 --> 26:40.769
You thought about it though.

26:40.810 --> 26:44.200
Oh, for five minutes.
l knew how devastated you'd be.

26:44.250 --> 26:47.208
You knew l'd rip your knackers off,
more like.

26:49.770 --> 26:52.125
Fuck's sake though.

26:52.170 --> 26:53.444
20 quid stake.

26:54.690 --> 26:56.487
What did Waggy offer you for t'car?

26:56.530 --> 26:58.009
Oh, he wasn't interested.

26:58.050 --> 27:02.646
He wasn't interested unless
l gave him the name of the horse.

27:02.690 --> 27:05.443
Leave it with me.

27:05.490 --> 27:07.799
But if you ever try
anything like that again,

27:07.850 --> 27:09.363
l will rip your knackers off.

28:09.490 --> 28:10.809
What the fuck?!

28:10.850 --> 28:15.048
Right. l wanna know where this
came from. You left this in here.

28:15.090 --> 28:16.842
lt was you in the shop wasn't it?
You did the shop over?

28:16.890 --> 28:18.846
No, no. l didn't.

28:18.890 --> 28:20.767
lan!

28:20.810 --> 28:21.845
Aagh! What's he doing?

28:21.890 --> 28:24.688
- Tell us the truth.
- l am. l am. lt's not mine.

28:24.730 --> 28:28.689
l bought it from a bloke in a shop,
my shop. l fence goods.

28:28.730 --> 28:29.958
Who was it? l want a name.

28:30.010 --> 28:32.922
l'm sorry. l have a rule. No names.

28:32.970 --> 28:36.201
My brother's on the other side
of that wall, and he has a rule

28:36.250 --> 28:39.526
never to bite people's cocks off. lan!

28:39.570 --> 28:42.164
The name! Now! lan!

28:42.210 --> 28:45.646
All right! All right.
l'll tell you his name.

28:45.690 --> 28:47.601
Good boy!

28:47.650 --> 28:49.925
Hello. >

28:49.970 --> 28:51.722
Hang on.

28:54.730 --> 28:57.927
Dope, Coke or E's?

28:57.970 --> 28:59.608
BABY CRlES

28:59.650 --> 29:02.323
What the fucking hell
are you doing here?

29:02.370 --> 29:05.123
Mum! Language! Baby!

29:06.010 --> 29:07.762
You wanted a name. For the robbery?

29:10.090 --> 29:13.321
Just half an hour with
Mandy, and the baby.

29:13.370 --> 29:15.759
He's at that address
most days, apparently.

29:19.770 --> 29:22.807
Right lads. Come on.

29:25.490 --> 29:27.720
l've had a job to keep it to myself...

29:27.770 --> 29:30.204
Kev, come on. Be a pal, eh.

29:30.250 --> 29:33.128
Frank. Look, forget it.
Right. l've told you once.

29:33.170 --> 29:35.081
Look no. Sorry. No. Forget it.

29:35.130 --> 29:37.439
lt's not for me. lt's for Sheila.

29:37.490 --> 29:41.244
Yeah, for her birthday.
l want to get her a pressie.

29:41.290 --> 29:44.202
Kev. Barrel.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.047
Jesus.

30:17.410 --> 30:18.889
Zip it!

30:25.570 --> 30:27.606
l'm thinking of naming
her after my Mum.

30:27.650 --> 30:29.447
Oh, no please, for fuck's sake.

30:29.490 --> 30:31.048
You can't call a little baby Mimi!

30:31.090 --> 30:33.046
Not Mimi. That's her nickname.

30:33.090 --> 30:36.366
Katherine's her real name.

30:36.410 --> 30:37.968
l thought... Katie.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.602
Katie?

30:41.170 --> 30:42.808
That's all right, that is.

30:42.850 --> 30:43.999
Little Katie.

30:44.050 --> 30:46.962
Here, before l forget.

30:50.810 --> 30:51.879
What's this for?

30:51.930 --> 30:53.443
Child support.

30:53.490 --> 30:55.526
And l can pay you that every month.

30:55.570 --> 30:58.880
Forget it, Lip. l don't want it.
My family'll give us what we need.

30:58.930 --> 30:59.999
l just wanna...

31:00.050 --> 31:02.006
Look, l know what you're thinking.

31:02.050 --> 31:04.518
You're looking at this
beautiful little thing,

31:04.570 --> 31:07.130
and thinking you wanna get involved.

31:07.170 --> 31:09.730
Just like every other lad on the estate.

31:09.770 --> 31:13.001
But try finding any of them
after a couple of months.

31:13.050 --> 31:15.280
You'd need sodding
lnterpol, never mind the CSA.

31:15.330 --> 31:16.524
l'm not like that.

31:16.570 --> 31:19.880
Take your money, Lip.
You need it more than we do.

31:19.930 --> 31:21.329
What's that supposed to mean?

31:21.370 --> 31:25.522
l hear you've been putting it about,
pulling posh girls.

31:25.570 --> 31:26.923
Who's told you that?

31:26.970 --> 31:28.881
Never you mind.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.727
l'm not seeing her.

31:30.770 --> 31:33.204
Just a one-night stand.

31:33.250 --> 31:35.810
Yeah well, hope you used protection.

31:37.450 --> 31:41.489
l'm taking her back in.
lt's getting a bit chilly.

31:43.050 --> 31:44.529
See you around.

31:57.770 --> 32:00.159
Right then, out ya come, bollocks.

32:00.210 --> 32:02.007
Nice and easy guys.

32:07.570 --> 32:10.209
ln you go.

32:10.250 --> 32:11.729
Come on, come on, come on.

32:16.090 --> 32:23.360
For the last time,
where's the fucking bracelet?

32:23.410 --> 32:27.483
We'll untie your hands when you
tell us where the bracelet is.

32:29.050 --> 32:30.768
Jesus Christ on a bike!

32:33.650 --> 32:38.440
You're playing a very
dangerous game, sonny.

32:41.010 --> 32:45.128
Right, Donny, l've had enough of
with this dozy cunt, wire him up.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.443
Where's the bracelet?

32:57.530 --> 32:59.202
Where's the fucking bracelet?

33:01.330 --> 33:06.245
This'll loosen your tongue.
Last chance.

33:15.690 --> 33:18.443
Aagh! You could have
some bugger's eye out with that!

33:23.810 --> 33:25.368
lan, it's a dead cert.

33:25.410 --> 33:27.685
You ain't getting no money off me.

33:27.730 --> 33:29.243
Debbie? Have you got owt?

33:29.290 --> 33:34.125
lt's for Sheila's present. l've got
my giro coming next Tuesday.

33:34.170 --> 33:35.364
l'll look.

33:35.410 --> 33:37.446
Debbie! Don't give it to him.

33:37.490 --> 33:38.764
What's the matter with you?

33:38.810 --> 33:41.370
You. What are you playing at? Eh?

33:41.410 --> 33:44.322
Look at you.
Blagging money off your kids.

33:44.370 --> 33:47.009
You should be buying her things.
Dolls and shit.

33:47.050 --> 33:48.608
- lt's only till Tuesday.
- You should be loving her.

33:48.650 --> 33:49.639
l do love her.

33:49.690 --> 33:51.009
You should be protecting her.

33:51.050 --> 33:53.359
- What does she need protecting from?
- This!

33:53.410 --> 33:57.847
This house. This life.
This shit family.

33:57.890 --> 33:59.403
Why don't you fuck off out?

34:01.450 --> 34:03.008
Go on. Get out.

34:03.050 --> 34:04.688
Where?

34:04.730 --> 34:07.119
l don't know just out!
Play with your mates.

34:07.170 --> 34:10.924
Stop acting like some
40-year-old woman.

34:10.969 --> 34:13.768
Go and play knock and run, or
skipping, or whatever it is you do.

34:13.810 --> 34:15.129
Lip. Leave it out.

34:15.170 --> 34:17.161
No. She should be out playing.

34:17.210 --> 34:20.202
lt's half ten.
lt's too late to be playing out.

34:20.250 --> 34:25.608
Yeah. lt's too late for you.

34:25.650 --> 34:30.882
She's 13-years-old and her life's over!

34:36.570 --> 34:39.721
Well done, you twat.

34:40.210 --> 34:41.723
Debbie!

34:41.770 --> 34:43.168
(lan) Debbie!

34:44.010 --> 34:46.888
l do love her.

34:46.929 --> 34:50.525
l were, l were gonna get her a
present with the winnings.

35:07.010 --> 35:09.524
l'm sorry, Deb.

35:15.090 --> 35:18.241
Mandy won't let me help out
with the baby.

35:18.290 --> 35:21.043
And l'm sorry.

35:21.090 --> 35:23.206
l shouldn't have taken it out on you.

35:29.050 --> 35:33.043
lt's all right. lt's a shame.

35:33.090 --> 35:35.160
You'd make a great dad.

35:35.210 --> 35:37.599
Oh, yeah. With all his prospects.

35:37.650 --> 35:39.129
Shut it, you.

35:39.170 --> 35:42.560
Well, she's not too far away.

35:42.610 --> 35:44.248
You'll be able to see her.

35:44.290 --> 35:48.727
l just wanted to do stuff for her.

35:48.770 --> 35:50.249
Buy her stuff.

35:52.210 --> 35:56.965
- Get her a pony.
- Why?

35:57.010 --> 36:00.446
You know. To ride.

36:00.490 --> 36:05.245
She's a Maguire, it'll be
pulling a rag and bone cart.

36:05.290 --> 36:12.446
Don't be horrible.
Anyway she's not all theirs.

36:12.490 --> 36:16.768
She's half Maguire
and half Gallagher.

36:19.730 --> 36:21.880
What the fuck are you looking at?

36:23.530 --> 36:25.885
Not sure which is worse.

36:25.930 --> 36:27.966
Don't worry.

36:28.010 --> 36:30.524
You'll get to see her.

36:30.570 --> 36:32.606
You reckon?

36:32.650 --> 36:35.881
Yeah, but not if you
sit here moping around.

36:35.930 --> 36:37.363
You've gotta do something.

36:38.450 --> 36:41.487
Come here.

36:54.530 --> 36:55.679
Oh, fuck!

36:56.890 --> 37:00.246
You'll have to climb out the window.
Get in the wardrobe, then.

37:00.290 --> 37:02.520
Wait a minute.

37:05.770 --> 37:07.647
Even when you say you're
going home, you sneak back in.

37:07.690 --> 37:09.248
What is your problem?

37:09.290 --> 37:10.609
We have to be honest in this house.

37:10.650 --> 37:13.687
Look, if it's just about the money,
l will give you money...

37:13.730 --> 37:15.163
So are you living here or not?

37:17.090 --> 37:18.364
Yeah.

37:18.410 --> 37:19.923
Yeah, all right. l'm living here.

37:19.970 --> 37:21.119
That's £20 a week.

37:21.170 --> 37:22.398
Fine.

37:23.890 --> 37:25.369
Carl!

37:31.570 --> 37:33.765
Finish us off!

38:09.370 --> 38:10.803
(Fucking hell.)

38:40.890 --> 38:41.879
They're not in.

38:41.930 --> 38:43.886
Look, she's my daughter.
l've got a right to see her.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.841
They've all gone off.

38:45.890 --> 38:46.959
Gone off where?

38:47.010 --> 38:51.800
Look. That dickhead you grassed up
wouldn't tell us a fucking word.

38:51.850 --> 38:55.047
So Pat and my boys are giving
him the car-park treatment.

38:55.090 --> 38:56.239
What's that?

38:56.290 --> 38:59.202
Hang him off the top of the
multi-storey till he speaks.

38:59.250 --> 39:00.808
What, and they've taken the baby?

39:00.850 --> 39:04.479
lt's never too early to initiate a
Maguire into the ways of the clan.

39:28.170 --> 39:30.445
You got a bet on, Frank?

39:30.490 --> 39:32.162
Nah, not as such, no.

39:32.210 --> 39:34.360
What's the betting slip for then?

39:34.410 --> 39:37.368
You what?
Oh, yeah, a bet? Oh, sorry...

39:37.410 --> 39:40.959
Yeah, er, well, you know, l
dabble now and again, as you know.

39:41.010 --> 39:42.602
You've got to, haven't you?

39:42.650 --> 39:44.561
ls it this race?

39:44.610 --> 39:47.682
Um... Redcar 3. 10, yeah.

39:47.730 --> 39:48.879
Which horse?

39:48.930 --> 39:51.569
- l forget the name.
- Which horse?

39:51.610 --> 39:52.679
Rat Pack.

39:52.730 --> 39:54.686
You thieving wanker.

39:54.730 --> 39:57.802
l needed the cash,
Kev, for Sheila's present.

39:57.850 --> 39:59.920
She's starving us out!
l had no choice!

39:59.970 --> 40:02.086
- How much have you got on it?
- 60 quid.

40:02.130 --> 40:04.246
60 quid...
where've you got 60 quid from?

40:04.290 --> 40:06.360
l sold the car for 300 quid.

40:06.410 --> 40:09.322
You should see the queue at the
bookie's. Odds have gone right down.

40:09.370 --> 40:10.883
What to?

40:10.930 --> 40:14.479
Evens.

40:14.530 --> 40:16.202
Evens? How the fu...

40:16.250 --> 40:18.320
(Man) Come on, Rat Pack.
- Where've you got 60 quid from?

40:18.370 --> 40:20.361
- Nowhere.
- Frank!

40:20.410 --> 40:24.085
lt was nine to one, it's now evens.
What the bloody hell's happened?

40:25.650 --> 40:28.244
l passed the tip on to
one or two folk...

40:28.290 --> 40:30.008
y'know, for a small consideration.

40:30.050 --> 40:32.041
Who'd you tell?

40:32.090 --> 40:33.648
Billy Joyner...

40:33.690 --> 40:35.885
and Eddie Norton.

40:35.930 --> 40:37.363
Micky Hills.

40:37.410 --> 40:42.564
Micky Hills? Micky Hills' brother
is a sodding bookie!

40:42.610 --> 40:43.599
He's not gonna say owt!
He promised me!

40:43.650 --> 40:46.562
Come on, Rat Pack!

40:48.130 --> 40:50.803
Bloody hell, Frank.
No wonder it's evens!

40:50.850 --> 40:54.001
Half of bleeding
Manchester's put a bet on now!

40:55.330 --> 40:58.879
(Commentator) 'Rat Pack charging down
the nearside... Rat Pack is

40:58.930 --> 41:01.922
'beginning to get up...
lt's Rat Pack from Hester Bridge!

41:01.970 --> 41:03.767
'Rat Pack wins by about a length.'

41:03.810 --> 41:05.607
CHEERlNG

41:05.650 --> 41:07.083
Nice one, mate!

41:12.050 --> 41:13.324
lt won, then.

41:13.370 --> 41:15.008
Oh, it's great that, innit,

41:15.050 --> 41:17.245
for you and everyone else in here.

41:17.290 --> 41:19.281
We'd have won three grand if
you hadn't fucked the odds.

41:19.330 --> 41:23.767
l just spent 20 minutes with Waggy
staring at my tits for fuck all!

41:23.810 --> 41:26.643
Nice one, Frank.

41:27.570 --> 41:29.925
Right, last time.

41:29.970 --> 41:31.449
Where is the bracelet?

41:33.050 --> 41:34.847
Hmm? Come on!

41:34.890 --> 41:36.084
Stop!

41:37.410 --> 41:38.399
Wait!

41:39.490 --> 41:40.718
What the hell you got there, Gallagher?

41:40.770 --> 41:42.362
lt's for my daughter.

41:42.410 --> 41:44.765
Very sweet, l'm sure.
Seeing as you're here,

41:44.810 --> 41:46.607
you can give us a hand
dropping this goon off the edge.

41:46.650 --> 41:48.129
What?

41:48.170 --> 41:50.047
Jesus, he's at it again.

41:50.090 --> 41:52.968
Thinks it's funny playing
Give Us A Fucking Clue.

41:53.010 --> 41:56.002
Well, here's one.
lt's a film. Six words.

41:56.050 --> 41:57.881
The Man Who Fell To Earth.

41:57.930 --> 41:59.124
lt's sign language.

41:59.170 --> 42:00.569
l beg your pardon?

42:00.610 --> 42:02.248
He's fucking deaf, isn't he?

42:02.290 --> 42:03.962
Any idiot can tell you that.

42:04.010 --> 42:06.126
That explains not screaming with

42:06.170 --> 42:08.604
12,000 volts running
through your bollocks.

42:08.650 --> 42:10.129
Still deserves a pasting.

42:10.170 --> 42:13.401
Jesus, Maguire! My daughter's
being brought up in your house,

42:13.450 --> 42:16.726
and you're too thick to realise
you're torturing a fucking mute.

42:16.770 --> 42:18.567
Watch what you're fucking saying.

42:20.410 --> 42:22.719
Where's the bracelet?

42:22.770 --> 42:25.045
Where is it?

42:25.930 --> 42:27.602
Look, see..

42:27.650 --> 42:30.118
- Well, what's he saying?
- l dunno.

42:30.170 --> 42:32.047
Who's got a pen?

42:32.090 --> 42:33.159
Hang on, spray can.

42:33.210 --> 42:34.962
(Patrick) Good idea. Get it out.

42:35.010 --> 42:38.002
This better be fucking good.

43:15.690 --> 43:16.725
Fuck!

43:18.210 --> 43:21.361
No-one talks to my family like that.

43:23.250 --> 43:24.888
Not even a fucking mute.

43:30.810 --> 43:33.449
He's still alive!

43:33.490 --> 43:34.639
What's he saying?

43:34.690 --> 43:39.002
l don't know. He's probably
thanking his lucky stars.

43:39.050 --> 43:42.008
Right, come on lads, time for a pint.

43:51.530 --> 43:54.647
Pint of dog, Kev, and a whisky
chaser, and one for yourself.

43:54.690 --> 43:56.442
- Veronica? Drink?
- What are you gonna to do with that?

43:56.490 --> 44:00.244
What am l gonna do?
l'm gonna have a big fucking party!

44:00.290 --> 44:02.008
Oh, that's a bit tight, innit?

44:02.050 --> 44:03.449
Whatever happened to
share and share alike?

44:03.490 --> 44:05.526
That's what l'm doin', innit?

44:05.570 --> 44:07.959
Yeah, but l mean, what about your kids?

44:08.010 --> 44:09.807
You're going to give your kids
some money.

44:09.850 --> 44:11.078
Well...

44:11.130 --> 44:14.805
Well, you know, Debbie can always do
with a bit of help with housekeeping.

44:14.850 --> 44:18.001
lan can't earn much
glass collecting in here, can he?

44:18.050 --> 44:21.167
And Carl and Lip are
always needing new clothes.

44:21.210 --> 44:22.438
Jesus wept.
Thank fuck l didn't have any more.

44:22.490 --> 44:23.605
Liam.

44:23.650 --> 44:26.369
Then there's the twins - that'll be two.

44:26.410 --> 44:28.685
- Oh, and that...
- What's that for?

44:28.730 --> 44:29.719
That's for me.

44:29.770 --> 44:31.488
Hot tips cost money, Francis.

44:34.050 --> 44:35.199
Fucking hell.

44:35.250 --> 44:38.322
There's 40 quid there.
You'll be able to get Sheila

44:38.370 --> 44:41.567
something really nice
with that, won't ya?

44:45.650 --> 44:47.208
l'm sorry, love.

44:47.250 --> 44:49.810
l'm afraid the little
deaf cunt got away.

44:49.850 --> 44:53.889
So l only hope this will go
some way to making up for your loss.

44:58.130 --> 44:59.609
Patrick!

45:01.970 --> 45:05.167
Oh, l'm fucking made up!

45:05.210 --> 45:06.802
Nice, isn't it?

45:15.010 --> 45:17.649
GlGGLlNG

45:23.890 --> 45:25.881
(Patrick) Oh, my God!

45:25.930 --> 45:29.923
Frank! Come on home.

45:29.970 --> 45:31.449
Just a minu...

45:33.570 --> 45:34.559
What's that?

45:40.490 --> 45:42.879
lt's...a little gift.

45:42.930 --> 45:44.045
ls it for me?

45:44.090 --> 45:45.125
For you.

45:47.290 --> 45:48.518
Happy birthday.

45:48.570 --> 45:51.607
Oh, Frank. You're such a lovely man.

45:53.050 --> 45:55.883
Thank you. Come on.

45:55.930 --> 46:01.482
Let's get you home. l'm gonna
cook you a nice Nigella or a Delia.

46:03.050 --> 46:05.883
Won't be needing that, then.
You can clear your tab.

46:05.930 --> 46:08.205
Come on.

46:08.250 --> 46:09.319
Come on.

46:10.690 --> 46:12.760
Oh, Frank, thank you.

46:12.810 --> 46:14.641
l love you so much.

46:19.570 --> 46:22.130
You must have dropped it in
the teddy's pocket.

46:24.090 --> 46:27.082
Listen. l thought you were
really great yesterday,

46:27.130 --> 46:28.609
what you said to my Dad.

46:28.650 --> 46:30.800
You know, no-one ever stands up to him.

46:30.850 --> 46:37.369
So, if you want to come round,
see Katie, well, that's OK.

46:38.730 --> 46:39.958
Cheers, Mandy.

46:40.010 --> 46:41.887
Thanks.

46:43.170 --> 46:46.003
Can l pick her up?
l've not picked her up yet.

46:46.050 --> 46:48.518
Go on. Don't fucking drop her.

46:48.570 --> 46:50.720
Language! Baby.

46:54.010 --> 46:57.082
(Lip) 'Boy meets girl.
Girl's dad kidnaps deaf mute.

46:57.130 --> 47:00.247
'Boy gets to hold baby.
lt's the age-old story.

47:00.290 --> 47:02.804
'Thing is, when you look at
your own child,

47:02.850 --> 47:07.207
'you think there's no other bloke in
the entire fucking universe cares

47:07.250 --> 47:11.323
'as much about this creature as l do,
and that's gotta mean sommat.'

47:14.730 --> 47:17.642
l'd like to report
someone for benefit fraud.

47:17.690 --> 47:20.488
Apparently they're looking into
everybody round here who's claiming.

47:20.530 --> 47:23.124
- Well, l'm fucked then.
(Woman) You and half the fucking estate.

47:23.170 --> 47:24.649
Parasites.

47:24.690 --> 47:26.920
l told Emily you'd be her brother.
They've got a visit round theirs.

47:26.970 --> 47:29.245
- Are they paying?
- Fuck off! She's me girlfriend.

47:29.290 --> 47:32.168
l've texted Lip three times.
Where the fuck is he?

47:32.210 --> 47:34.326
Ta-da! Brendan Tyler lives.

47:34.370 --> 47:37.203
Doesn't feel right to me though,
cracking on your married.

47:37.250 --> 47:38.968
- You bastard!
- What's this? An ambush?

47:39.010 --> 47:40.523
l saw you with Mandy Maguire.

47:40.570 --> 47:42.765
l can't believe you'd land me
in the shit!

47:42.810 --> 47:43.959
lt's got nowt to do with you!

47:44.010 --> 47:45.807
Cos l'm nothing, l suppose.

47:45.850 --> 47:47.363
Just your bit on the side.

47:47.410 --> 47:48.479
Argh!

47:48.530 --> 47:50.805
He's never asked me, you know, Tony.

47:50.850 --> 47:52.727
That should be me there.
That should be me!

47:52.770 --> 47:55.568
Ah! Sheila!

48:35.610 --> 48:39.319
700? l only won five.

48:39.370 --> 48:41.838
Sorry, mate.
l'm trying to run a business here.

48:41.890 --> 48:45.087
But the last time you sold
it us, Waggy, it was 600.

48:45.130 --> 48:46.802
Nothing l can do about it!

48:46.850 --> 48:48.329
