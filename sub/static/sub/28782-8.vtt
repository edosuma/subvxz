actually came
out to the farm

12:30.480 --> 12:32.040
planning
to do you harm.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.240
Now, your daddy
fought that man

12:35.240 --> 12:36.600
and almost killed him.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.600
Said it was like
being back in the war

12:38.600 --> 12:40.480
doing what he had
been trained to do.

12:40.480 --> 12:43.720
But then,
then there was a moment

12:43.720 --> 12:46.280
when they
were both covered
in blood and dirt,

12:46.280 --> 12:47.920
and the man's
barely conscious.

12:47.920 --> 12:51.880
Your father heard
your mother singing
to Ralph Angel.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.600
Now, he'd woke up crying,

12:53.600 --> 12:56.600
but it was Trudy's voice
that brought him
out of the dark.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.920
Mama had a voice
clear as a bell.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.680
Ah, so pure and clear,

13:02.680 --> 13:03.920
brought him to himself.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.880
And he ended up
helping the man.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.600
He dropped him off
at the hospital,

13:07.600 --> 13:09.440
and then he came on
back to the house.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.680
B-But I saw him digging.

13:11.680 --> 13:14.600
What you saw
was your daddy
burying his pain...

13:15.840 --> 13:17.760
his anger.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.680
Now, he took off
them bloody clothes
and the bat he used

13:20.680 --> 13:23.000
and anything that
reminded him of that night,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
and he buried it deep.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.440
He was hoping to forget

13:26.440 --> 13:28.320
that he'd been
trained to kill,

13:28.320 --> 13:31.640
and he saw that it was
still in him to do it again.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.120
-[car door closes]
-[car lock chirps]

13:41.320 --> 13:42.920
[door opens]

13:43.920 --> 13:46.600
[man sighing]

13:49.600 --> 13:52.240
Baby, I got here
as soon as I could.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.120
Thank you
for coming home, baby.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.840
Ah, hey, you know I got
your back, all right?

14:05.840 --> 14:07.680
How is everything?
You feeling okay?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.040
I'm feeling all right,
pretty good.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.720
Anything you
need me to do?

14:11.720 --> 14:13.240
You're here now.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.920
That's good enough
for me.

14:14.920 --> 14:19.280
I, uh, invited the kids over
later for family dinner.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.480
Everybody needs
some comfort,

14:21.480 --> 14:22.920
so that's what I'm cooking.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.120
All right.
Sounds good.

14:30.440 --> 14:33.840
Mmm. [laughs]

14:33.840 --> 14:35.680
[Ralph Angel]
I named this program
after my daddy,

14:35.680 --> 14:38.680
Ernest Bordelon.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.000
He was a man
of integrity,

14:41.000 --> 14:42.520
of honor.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.040
It's been an honor
for me to help folk,

14:45.040 --> 14:47.400
offer 'em work.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.760
Y'all gotta know
I would never
do anything

14:50.760 --> 14:52.920
to shame the legacy
of my father.

14:52.920 --> 14:57.000
Well, thank you
for your heartfelt words,
Mr. Bordelon,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.240
but in light of
Benjamin Williams's arrest,

14:59.240 --> 15:02.720
we still need to conduct
a thorough review
of your program.

15:03.720 --> 15:04.600
[sighs]

15:06.800 --> 15:09.600
As you can see there,
Mr. Williams has been

15:09.600 --> 15:11.800
a model citizen
during his parole.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.680
That, plus the fact
Sheriff Guidry

15:14.680 --> 15:18.200
has three open
files of possible
police misconduct

15:18.200 --> 15:22.520
casts doubt on the veracity
of this so-called bust.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.720
Taken together,
Mr. Williams's
suspicious arrest

15:25.720 --> 15:28.400
does not reflect
on the good work
and effectiveness

15:28.400 --> 15:30.520
of Mr. Bordelon's
reentry program.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.320
That may or
may not be true,

15:32.320 --> 15:35.080
but there's
another matter that's
come to our attention.

15:35.080 --> 15:36.600
The news says
there was a fire

15:36.600 --> 15:38.320
at Queen Sugar mill
last night.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.440
That's where you mill
your cane, right?

15:40.440 --> 15:44.120
Yes, sir, but we
milled more than
2/3 of my harvest

15:44.120 --> 15:45.120
before the fire.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.720
It's
a minor setback,

15:46.720 --> 15:48.680
but doesn't affect
the program.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.840
It does, if you're
unable to recuperate

15:50.840 --> 15:52.800
your losses
in time to make payroll.

15:52.800 --> 15:56.480
How will you pay
the parolees who require
40 hours of work per week?

15:56.480 --> 15:57.720
How will
your program survive

15:57.720 --> 15:59.600
if you can't afford
to plant next season?

15:59.600 --> 16:01.200
I mean, it wasn't
a total loss.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.880
Yeah, things
might get tight
for a minute, but--

16:03.880 --> 16:06.400
Mr. Bordelon,
surely you know
we'll have to take

16:06.400 --> 16:07.760
this new loss
into consideration.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.280
The panel will
reconvene this week,

16:10.280 --> 16:12.760
and you'll receive
our decision shortly after.

16:12.760 --> 16:13.800
Thank you
for coming in.

16:21.840 --> 16:26.440
The fire department
is-- is assessing the damage
at the moment,

16:26.440 --> 16:28.520
so, uh, once they do that,

16:28.520 --> 16:30.440
the insurance companies
will go in--

16:30.440 --> 16:32.040
The insurance company
can take years before
they settle this.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.520
Charley, we took
a chance milling
with you,

16:34.520 --> 16:36.600
but this thing
between y'all
and the Landrys

16:36.600 --> 16:38.080
is looking
too risky for us.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.840
Look, this is just
a-a temporary setback.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.720
A setback?
Your mill was on fire.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.440
I mean, how much did
you lose, Ralph Angel?

16:45.440 --> 16:47.400
I know you still had
cane out there to mill.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.840
Yeah, I did,

16:49.840 --> 16:51.840
but I'm thinking
about keeping
my people working,

16:51.840 --> 16:54.240
not how much money I lost.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.920
[sighs]

16:55.920 --> 16:59.040
Look, any of y'all
need some good workers,

16:59.040 --> 17:00.880
I got people.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.840
Can't afford
no one else, sorry,
not after all this.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.760
Let's just
keep talking, and...

17:05.760 --> 17:07.200
-I gotta get back.
-if...

17:08.600 --> 17:09.560
-Rah.
-if...

17:12.040 --> 17:14.400
if-- if you just--
if you just give me...

17:16.720 --> 17:18.920
I'll talk to 'em, okay,

17:18.920 --> 17:21.080
but you're gonna have
to give it some time.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.840
Expect the arson
investigator
to interview you.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.880
I wasn't there when i--
when it started.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.120
But you may
have information
on conditions

17:42.120 --> 17:44.000
that led
to the fire.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.480
They'll be looking
for evidence

17:45.480 --> 17:47.800
and possible motive
for whoever did this.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.720
We got that recording
of Frances Boudreaux.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.000
Her evil ass clear--

17:52.000 --> 17:54.320
It's good to have,
a smart move,

17:54.320 --> 17:56.880
but she didn't
outright confess,

17:56.880 --> 18:00.000
so that unfortunately
won't help you
in a court of law.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.280
You're saying,
in order to pursue

18:02.280 --> 18:04.240
a case
against Frances,

18:04.240 --> 18:07.120
we'll have to dig deeper
into her connection

18:07.120 --> 18:09.080
with Old World Energy
and prove--

18:09.080 --> 18:12.800
Prove criminal conspiracy
to commit arson.

18:19.880 --> 18:20.880
Okay.

18:20.880 --> 18:23.240
Okay. Okay, fine.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.400
We can do this.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.600
Jacob basically admitted

18:26.600 --> 18:29.280
that Frances teamed up
with Old World Energy

18:29.280 --> 18:31.480
to get them the highway
they need in order to drill.

18:31.480 --> 18:34.680
But we have no proof,
not yet.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.800
No, there has to be
another way.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.240
This is clearly collusion.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.440
We-- We know who did this.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.840
We just need proof!

18:40.840 --> 18:42.400
Let's talk
to Pastor Martinez.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.080
He said his congregants
were being pressured.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.200
They not gonna testify
against him,

18:45.200 --> 18:46.880
between the cops
and ICE.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.520
Okay, maybe--
maybe I could get

18:48.520 --> 18:50.280
a-a confession
from Jacob.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.000
W-We just need
one witness who could--

18:53.000 --> 18:56.440
[gasping]
just wh-who cou...

18:56.440 --> 18:59.600
Baby, your mill
just burned

18:59.600 --> 19:01.720
less than 24 hours ago.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.920
You don't have to have
all the answers
right now.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.000
Come on.

19:09.200 --> 19:13.280
This is a time for us
to look at each other,

19:13.280 --> 19:17.080
to hold each other,
and to heal.

19:19.800 --> 19:25.120
It's a time to break bread
as a family.

19:27.240 --> 19:29.440
Our Father, who art...

19:29.440 --> 19:31.080
[family joining in]
in heaven,

19:31.080 --> 19:33.000
hallowed by Thy name.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.400
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done

19:37.400 --> 19:41.160
on earth as it is in heaven.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.800
[dials]

19:46.800 --> 19:48.440
[phone line rings]

19:48.440 --> 19:50.520
Hello, beautiful.

19:50.520 --> 19:51.520
Hey.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.400
Are you back in Baton Rogue?

19:53.400 --> 19:56.840
Yep. I just got back.
Everyone okay there?

19:56.840 --> 20:01.240
They're fine, safe.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.720
They're not speaking to me,

20:02.720 --> 20:04.920
but they're fine,

20:04.920 --> 20:06.800
and that's
the important thing.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.280
You're important,
too, Nova.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.280
What you think about
all that's going on

20:13.280 --> 20:15.200
is an important
thing.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.640
I think...

20:21.400 --> 20:22.680
I've lost them.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.800
I've lost my family.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.320
I don't believe that.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.800
You didn't see
their faces.

20:31.800 --> 20:35.720
They looked at me
like I wasn't part of them,

20:35.720 --> 20:39.440
like I wasn't--
like I wasn't one of them.

20:40.680 --> 20:43.440
They looked at me
like a stranger...

20:44.440 --> 20:47.120
not even a stranger.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.400
Like an enemy.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.000
I've lost my family.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.120
[sobs]

21:01.120 --> 21:02.200
Where are you?

21:04.120 --> 21:05.080
Nova?

21:06.240 --> 21:08.080
Home.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.320
Okay, good.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.080
[sobbing]

21:15.080 --> 21:16.280
Just breathe,
sweetheart.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.480
Just breathe.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.320
[woman vocalizing]

21:24.320 --> 21:26.840
[Violet] We are
being tried, Lord...

21:28.200 --> 21:30.480
but I know you got us.

21:30.480 --> 21:33.640
so I thank you.

21:33.640 --> 21:37.600
I thank you for keeping us
in your safe place,

21:37.600 --> 21:43.040
Charley, Micah,
Ralph Angel, Blue.

21:44.280 --> 21:48.480
And I always thank you
for Hollywood.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.520
And I ask you to help me.

21:57.120 --> 22:00.600
I do miss
that stubborn child.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.840
I-- Though I
just can't with her.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.080
So you watch over her.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.280
Bless Nova.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.680
Touch her mind and heart...

22:20.920 --> 22:25.680
so that she knows the hurt
she done caused.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.600
And keep her safe.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.040
Amen.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.680
Lavoisier.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.680
L-A-V-O-I-S-I-E-R.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.200
Yeah. Thanks.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.360
-[hangs up]
-[knock on door]

22:48.360 --> 22:49.600
One sec!

22:54.920 --> 22:55.920
You came.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.120
[chuckles]

22:57.120 --> 22:59.280
I did.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.480
Can I come in?

23:07.080 --> 23:08.880
My visit isn't
about me or us.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.200
It's about you.

23:10.200 --> 23:13.720
Me? Well-- Well,
I'm struggling.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.200
That's me right now.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.240
All right,
let's talk about it.

23:17.240 --> 23:18.920
[knock on door]

23:20.600 --> 23:21.840
-Hey.
-Micah!

23:21.840 --> 23:23.360
-What's up?
-[chuckles]

23:23.360 --> 23:26.120
Just, um,
returning your keys.

23:26.120 --> 23:27.840
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.120
Glad you're here.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.400
Meet Calvin. This is
my nephew Micah.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.360
I've heard great things
about you, Micah.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.080
You're the cop?

23:36.720 --> 23:38.240
Ex-cop.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.680
You know, I'm thinking
I should make a sign

23:41.680 --> 23:43.360
or something
so everybody knows.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.880
I'm gonna make
a phone call,
if you don't mind.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.400
I'm gonna be
on the back porch.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.160
Of course.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.600
Go on.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.360
Say what's on your mind.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.240
I know
you're disappointed.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.000
Ah, it's none
of my business.
