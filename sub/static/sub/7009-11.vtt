00:29.821 --> 00:32.031

OOH-HOO.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.186
WELL, WHAT KIND
OF REFRIGERATOR WOULD YOU LIKE?

01:44.354 --> 01:46.772
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.149
OKAY, WHAT KIND OF FEATURES
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

01:49.317 --> 01:50.651
UM...

01:50.819 --> 01:53.445

03:15.570 --> 03:19.489
WHAT IF HE'S LOST

03:19.657 --> 03:22.034
CALM DOWN, LASSIE.
I'M SURE TIMMY'S JUST FINE.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.707
MAYBE WE SHOULD
CHECK THE SCHOOL MORGUE.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.171
KELSO, THE SCHOOL
DOESN'T HAVE A MORGUE.

03:34.339 --> 03:37.424

I'M WORRIED, MAN.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.686
OKAY, FINE. NOW LET'S

03:49.854 --> 03:52.105
I MEAN, FORMAN'S
NOT GONNA JUST DITCH US.

03:52.273 --> 03:55.067
THE CRUISER'S BATTERY
IS PROBABLY DEAD OR SOMETHIN'.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.819
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S STARTIN' TO GET LATE.

03:57.987 --> 03:59.821
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST START WALKING.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.199
NO, NO. I'M NOT WALKING.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.826

[ENGINE REVS]

04:14.420 --> 04:17.005
OH, MY GOD,

04:17.173 --> 04:20.050
OH, MAN, I HAD SUCH A CRUSH

04:20.218 --> 04:23.929

04:25.932 --> 04:27.474
HE'S WITH ERIC?

04:27.642 --> 04:30.352
THIS IS A SERIOUS
CLIQUE BREACH.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.812
A SERIOUS CLIQUE BREACH?

04:31.980 --> 04:33.814
WELL, THAT'S
THE WORST KIND.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.108
YOU SEE, BUDDY IS

04:36.276 --> 04:38.819
THEY MINGLE

04:38.987 --> 04:42.322
THEN YOU HAVE YOUR SMOKERS
AND YOUR HEADS, OKAY?

04:42.490 --> 04:45.492
RICH KIDS CAN BE SMOKERS
AND JOCKS CAN BE HEADS,

04:45.660 --> 04:49.121
BUT JOCKS CANNOT BE SMOKERS
UNLESS THEY'RE RICH.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.247
WHAT ABOUT LARRY MOSELY?

04:50.415 --> 04:53.583
HE'S A RICH, JOCK,

WE'VE ACTUALLY MET.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.679
NO, I AM FEZ.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.597
MY GODS, BUDDY,
WITH A CAR LIKE THAT,

05:07.765 --> 05:10.600
YOU MUST BE KNEE-DEEP
IN WHORES.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.273
OKAY, LET'S HEAD BACK

05:19.027 --> 05:21.945
WELL, NOW, RED, YOU KNOW,
WORKING AS A SALESMAN

05:22.113 --> 05:24.364

05:24.532 --> 05:27.743
YOU JUST...
YOU NEED TIME TO ADJUST.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.036
YOU...

05:29.203 --> 05:31.830
NEED TO USE
YOUR PEOPLE SKILLS!

05:34.250 --> 05:37.377
KITTY, I DON'T HAVE
ANY PEOPLE SKILLS.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.379
OKAY, COME ON NOW.

05:39.547 --> 05:40.547

05:41.591 --> 05:43.383
YOU CAN DO THIS.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.135
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS SMILE.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.387
THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
PEOPLE SKILL OF ALL.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.514
SO COME ON,
LET ME SEE IT.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.266
YEAH?

05:55.646 --> 05:57.314
OKAY.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.566
YOU JUST KEEP ON
SMILIN'.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.986
THEY'RE FINALLY
GETTING OFF THE ISLAND.

06:05.114 --> 06:08.450
NO, FEZ, THEY'RE NOT
GETTING OFF THAT ISLAND.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.035
BUT THEY HAVE
A COCONUT RADIO.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.995
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

06:15.124 --> 06:17.376
OH, "JILLIGAN."

06:22.840 --> 06:25.258
OH, THERE YOU GUYS ARE.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.431
WE HAD TO WALK
ALL THE WAY HERE, MAN.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.266
MY FEET ARE KILLING ME.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.434
ARE YOUR FINGERS BROKEN?

06:34.602 --> 06:36.561
YOU CAN'T
USE A PHONE?

06:36.729 --> 06:38.313
DO YOU KNOW
IT'S FREEZING OUTSIDE?

06:38.481 --> 06:39.314
AND I'M WEARING
MY UNCLE'S BOOTS,

06:39.482 --> 06:40.816
SO NOW I HAVE A BLISTER!

06:40.983 --> 06:42.651

06:48.616 --> 06:50.242

IT'S MY FAULT.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.285
I GAVE ERIC A RIDE HOME,
SO, UH...

GET OUTTA MY CHAIR!

06:53.454 --> 06:54.329
OKAY.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.123
I REALLY HAVE TO

06:56.290 --> 06:59.000
SO... OH, HEY, YOUR CAR'S

OH, YEAH. SURE.

07:05.466 --> 07:08.051
AND, HEY, GUYS, I'M REAL SORRY
I FORGOT ABOUT YA.

07:08.219 --> 07:08.927
HEY, DID YOU

07:20.982 --> 07:24.943
DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW DIFFICULT
IT IS TO CLIQUE JUMP?

07:25.111 --> 07:27.112
ERIC HAS ACHIEVED
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL,

07:27.280 --> 07:29.364
AND YOU'RE BOTH RUINING
IT FOR HIM.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.992
OH, WHO CARES?

07:32.160 --> 07:35.620
I'M TIRED, AND I NEVER

07:46.007 --> 07:47.841
SCREW HIM, MAN.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.552
I MEAN, HE'S GOT THE MONEY,
THE CAR, THE FAMILY.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.637
THE TEACHERS LIKE HIM.
THE COUNSELORS LIKE HIM.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.140
EVERYBODY LIKES HIM.
I HATE HIM.

07:56.142 --> 08:00.353
HYDE, DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
OVERREACTING JUST A LITTLE BIT?

08:00.521 --> 08:02.939

08:11.491 --> 08:14.743
WELL, AT LEAST YOU

AND, UM, I'LL ALWAYS
BE YOUR FRIEND.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.373
THANKS, DONNA.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.713

DON'T THINK THAT
APPEARANCE AND PHYSIQUE

13:59.630 --> 14:01.965
AREN'T IMPORTANT
TO HIM, TOO.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.300
JOHNNY AND JANEY
BOTH NEED REASSURANCE

14:04.468 --> 14:07.262
THAT THEY ARE ACCEPTED
AND RESPECTED FOR WHAT THEY ARE.

14:15.479 --> 14:16.521
LOOK, I'M NOT GAY.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.982
YEAH, YEAH.

14:20.860 --> 14:21.317
ARE YOU SURE?

14:21.485 --> 14:22.026
YES.

14:22.194 --> 14:22.986
BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT THAT...

14:23.153 --> 14:24.571
WELL, WHY WOULD YOU
HAVE THOUGHT THAT?

14:24.738 --> 14:26.281
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SPENDING
SO MUCH TIME TOGETHER.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.615
BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS.

14:27.783 --> 14:30.159
I... I'VE BEEN FRIENDS
WITH HYDE FOR YEARS,

14:30.327 --> 14:31.995
AND I NEVER PUT
THE MOVES ON HIM.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.997
BUT HYDE'S A JERK.

14:34.164 --> 14:37.417
WELL, YEAH,
BUT THAT'S NOT THE REASON.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.502
IT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT GAY.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.754
RIGHT.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.924
I'M SORRY
FOR KISSING YOU.

14:45.092 --> 14:47.385
THAT'S OKAY...
I MEAN, IT'S...

14:49.638 --> 14:52.056
LET'S JUST
FORGET ABOUT IT.

14:55.269 --> 14:55.852
DO YOU WANNA LISTEN
TO THE RADIO...

14:56.020 --> 14:58.396
HEY!
I TOLD YOU I WASN'T GAY!

I'M QUITTIN', KITTY.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.870
WELL, NOW,
YOU CAN'T QUIT.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.121
WHY NOT?

15:15.289 --> 15:16.456
BECAUSE IF THINGS
KEEP GOIN' LIKE THIS,

15:16.624 --> 15:19.083
BOB'S GONNA FIRE YOU, HA!

15:21.253 --> 15:23.546
IT'S A JOKE, RED.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.299
OH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
LET'S DO SOME ROLE PLAYING.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.468
WHAT?

15:28.636 --> 15:29.302

15:29.470 --> 15:30.720

THE INTERESTED CUSTOMER,

15:30.888 --> 15:33.806
AND YOU BE THE
HELPFUL SALESMAN.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.184
DOES THIS END UP
IN THE BEDROOM?

15:38.395 --> 15:39.479
WE'LL SEE.

15:39.647 --> 15:40.563
OH.

15:40.731 --> 15:41.773
OKAY.

15:41.941 --> 15:46.027
HERE WE GO.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.237
MY, THAT'S A LOVELY BLENDER.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.280
THIS IS STUPID.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.325
RED...

15:52.493 --> 15:55.244
WELL, IT'S GOT STAINLESS STEEL
ROTOR BLADES

15:55.412 --> 15:56.412
SO IT CAN CRUSH ICE,

15:56.580 --> 15:58.539
WHICH IS WHY I KEEP IT
OUT HERE AT THE BAR,

15:58.707 --> 16:01.584
UM... AND IT HAS THE HIGHEST
WATTAGE THAT YOU CAN GET

16:01.752 --> 16:03.419
WITHOUT MOVING UP
TO THE INDUSTRIAL MODEL

16:03.587 --> 16:05.880
WHICH WOULD COST YOU
TWICE AS MUCH.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.633
WELL, NOW, SEE, WE HAVE HAD
THIS BLENDER ALL THESE YEARS,

16:08.801 --> 16:11.177
AND I NEVER KNEW
THAT'S WHY WE BOUGHT IT.

16:11.345 --> 16:11.886
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?

16:12.054 --> 16:14.597
HOW COULD YOU
NOT KNOW THAT?!

16:14.765 --> 16:16.849
RED, EVERYBODY
DOESN'T RESEARCH EVERY PRODUCT

16:17.017 --> 16:18.643
BEFORE THEY BUY IT.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.937
WELL, THEN,
THEY'RE DUMB ASSES.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.147
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:23.315 --> 16:27.860
AND THAT'S WHY THEY NEED YOU
TO TELL THEM WHAT TO BUY.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.028
HMM.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.030
[SNICKERS LOUDLY]

16:31.198 --> 16:34.701

TAILOR-MADE FOR THIS JOB.

16:34.868 --> 16:35.952
HECK, I GO
INTO BUY SOMETHING,

16:36.120 --> 16:39.330
ALL I KNOW
IS WHAT COLOR I WANT.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.419
YOU'RE ONE OF THEM!

16:45.379 --> 16:48.464
WELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD
BE NICE TO ME, RED,

16:48.632 --> 16:50.049
BECAUSE I THINK
I MIGHT BE INTERESTED

16:50.217 --> 16:52.760
IN PURCHASING A MATTRESS.

16:53.220 --> 16:56.556
KITTY, WE DON'T
EVEN SELL... OH!

17:03.647 --> 17:07.150

17:09.319 --> 17:11.779

JACKIE.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.699
I CAN TALK TO ERIC
ABOUT THINGS

17:14.867 --> 17:18.619

17:47.441 --> 17:50.026
YOU HAD TO WALK ALL THE WAY
HOME FROM SCHOOL AGAIN?

17:50.194 --> 17:53.863
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON
WE'RE UPSET WITH YOU.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.948
THAT'S MY ONLY REASON.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.659

HAD ANOTHER REASON.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.037
NO. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.
