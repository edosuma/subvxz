WEBVTT

00:08.128 --> 00:10.929
Babe, are you okay?
Your hand is, like, sweating.

00:10.954 --> 00:12.678
I'm excited. I never thought

00:12.703 --> 00:14.551
I'd get to go to a "Paris Review" party.

00:14.576 --> 00:15.734
Oh, it's not that big a deal.

00:15.759 --> 00:16.741
It is.

00:16.766 --> 00:19.111
They discovered Kerouac and Philip Roth.

00:19.136 --> 00:21.668
And now they're
discovering Colin McNichol.

00:21.693 --> 00:22.653
- Yeah!
- No, they're publishing

00:22.678 --> 00:25.097
my short story. You discovered me.

00:25.122 --> 00:26.543
I've submitted to them for years,

00:26.568 --> 00:28.288
and they rejected me every single time.

00:28.313 --> 00:30.337
Okay, but now that you've sold
a book for a million dollars,

00:30.362 --> 00:33.732
- now they want you, huh?
- Uh, 1.2 million, okay?

00:33.757 --> 00:34.843
- Okay.
- But let's not talk money.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.138
These people are intellectuals.

00:36.163 --> 00:37.218
She means snobs.

00:37.243 --> 00:39.899
I mean the top literary
minds in the country,

00:39.924 --> 00:41.481
and they're all here to see you.

00:41.506 --> 00:43.561
Great, now my hands are sweaty.

00:43.586 --> 00:44.890
Ha ha!

00:49.050 --> 00:52.180
Kelsey, hey.
I'd like to introduce you to my editor.

00:52.205 --> 00:53.559
This is...

00:53.584 --> 00:55.487
- Kelsey!
- Pip-squeak!

00:55.512 --> 00:56.777
Mwah. Hi.

00:56.801 --> 00:58.148
Everybody knows everybody at this party.

00:58.173 --> 00:59.766
We interned together, but then this one

00:59.791 --> 01:01.480
got her own imprint and
left us all in the dust.

01:01.505 --> 01:02.971
Okay, all right, well, you're the one

01:02.996 --> 01:05.045
with the hottest property
in town right now.

01:05.069 --> 01:06.518
Mm. We're both right.

01:06.698 --> 01:08.297
That photographer wants us.

01:08.322 --> 01:09.588
Let's get lunch on the books soon.

01:09.614 --> 01:11.206
- I'd love to.
- Back into the fray.

01:11.231 --> 01:13.464
- Oh, you don't... come here.
- Okay, okay.

01:16.486 --> 01:17.537
- Hey, guys.
- Yeah.

01:17.562 --> 01:19.681
- There you are.
- Oh. Hey, sorry.

01:19.706 --> 01:21.752
- All this, it's a lot.
- Mm.

01:21.777 --> 01:23.025
Well, you should get used to it.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.349
This is your life now.

01:24.374 --> 01:25.555
You should think about getting a tux.

01:25.580 --> 01:27.429
- For what?
- The PEN Awards,

01:27.454 --> 01:29.696
the National Book Award, the Met Gala.

01:29.721 --> 01:30.764
Yeah, you might need two tuxes.

01:30.789 --> 01:32.940
Okay, okay, okay, enough. Stop.

01:32.965 --> 01:34.382
Josh, what was the last tattoo you did?

01:34.407 --> 01:36.085
Ugh. You wanna show him?

01:36.110 --> 01:37.977
Uh, I'm gonna keep my underwear on

01:38.002 --> 01:39.519
at the Paris Review party, thank you.

01:39.544 --> 01:41.411
You got a tattoo?

01:41.436 --> 01:42.984
Yeah. Why not?

01:43.009 --> 01:44.756
Because they're really
hard to get rid of.

01:44.781 --> 01:46.375
Well, maybe I don't want
to get rid of this one.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.856
Congratulations, Colin!

01:49.448 --> 01:53.488
Buy something stupid yet
with your $2 million advance?

01:53.513 --> 01:55.096
It wasn't $2 million, bud.

01:55.121 --> 01:57.183
You poor bastard.

01:57.208 --> 01:59.685
You can handle 1.2 mil, though, right?

01:59.710 --> 02:01.801
All right, bro,
why don't you take about 30 steps back?

02:01.826 --> 02:04.258
Random House isn't buying
any more fiction this year

02:04.283 --> 02:07.371
because they spent all
their money on you.

02:07.396 --> 02:09.566
Have a good night, bud.

02:10.025 --> 02:11.402
You dumbass!

02:11.427 --> 02:12.821
Oh, my God!

02:12.846 --> 02:16.295
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, Chris!

02:21.935 --> 02:24.413
I haven't been in a
fight since junior high.

02:24.438 --> 02:26.294
It was kind of fun.

02:26.319 --> 02:28.218
Well, that was hardly a fight.
I weigh more than that wimp.

02:28.243 --> 02:30.077
- What?
- Oh, don't! Don't!

02:34.642 --> 02:37.466
Things are good, right?

02:38.360 --> 02:40.197
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:40.222 --> 02:41.422
Things are good.

02:43.204 --> 02:46.794
You know,
I don't think I've said this enough

02:46.819 --> 02:50.042
since we've been back together, but...

02:50.850 --> 02:52.817
I love you.

02:58.023 --> 03:00.898
Like, I really love you.

03:03.682 --> 03:05.268
I love you too.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.074

03:26.073 --> 03:27.752
- Uh, good morning.
- Morning.

03:27.777 --> 03:29.911
You missed Soul Cycle again.

03:29.936 --> 03:31.581
Yeah, but I got a workout.

03:31.606 --> 03:33.815
You know what,
sex doesn't burn that many cal...

03:33.840 --> 03:36.253
- 300 calories?
- Bam.

03:36.278 --> 03:38.164
- Do you do anything in bed?
- What?

03:39.293 --> 03:41.795
She's enthusiastic.

03:41.820 --> 03:43.309
Hey, what's that in your hair?

03:43.333 --> 03:44.599
What?

03:44.624 --> 03:46.197
Oh, this little rubber band thingy?

03:46.223 --> 03:47.584
Uh, yeah, where did you get it?

03:47.609 --> 03:49.920
Oh, um, off the bathroom floor.

03:49.945 --> 03:51.328
When?

03:51.353 --> 03:54.372
I-I don't know, like,
a couple days ago, a week.

03:54.397 --> 03:55.546
- A week?
- What's wrong?

03:55.571 --> 03:56.884
- That's my UvoRing.
- Ew!

03:56.909 --> 03:58.600
- Your what?
- My birth control.

03:58.625 --> 04:00.045
Wa...

04:00.070 --> 04:01.836
Ri...
that's supposed to be up inside of you?

04:01.861 --> 04:02.935
- Yes.
- How did it get out?

04:02.960 --> 04:04.105
- I don't know.
- So... wait.

04:04.130 --> 04:05.956
Maybe it's your enthusiastic sex.

04:05.981 --> 04:07.033
So we haven't had any protection

04:07.058 --> 04:08.598
in, like, a week?

04:10.425 --> 04:12.462
Ooh.

04:13.309 --> 04:15.222
Just give me a hint.

04:15.247 --> 04:18.149
If I told you what was in
my secret lemon curd recipe,

04:18.175 --> 04:21.101
it would no longer be mine nor a secret.

04:21.127 --> 04:22.259
Will I see you tonight?

04:22.284 --> 04:24.246
I certainly hope so.

04:24.420 --> 04:26.606
I'm having dinner with
Jackie Dunn after work,

04:26.631 --> 04:29.987
so if I'm not home, just ask
Pavel at the desk to let you in.

04:30.012 --> 04:34.237
Mm, if Sergei is working,
tell him you're my brother.

04:34.261 --> 04:35.635
He's obsessed with me.

04:35.661 --> 04:37.247
You know, my last client's at 5:00.

04:37.272 --> 04:39.254
Why don't I just hold onto your keys?

04:40.039 --> 04:41.488
Just for the day.

04:43.962 --> 04:46.029
- Uh...
- I'll give 'em right back.

04:47.250 --> 04:49.395
I would. I really would,

04:49.420 --> 04:51.563
but the co-op has strict rules.

04:51.588 --> 04:55.180
And I'm running for the board,
so how would it look?

04:55.377 --> 04:56.852
Okay.

04:57.499 --> 04:59.133
I'll see you tonight.

05:03.127 --> 05:04.883
Hm.

05:11.681 --> 05:14.553
All right, he got the test.
"Leaving drug store now."

05:14.578 --> 05:16.395
Here, just have some tea.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.332
I can't have a baby, Maggie.

05:18.357 --> 05:20.992
Well, the odds are
definitely against it.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.264
Right.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.728
But you never know,

05:23.753 --> 05:25.386
Josh may have some
really strong swimmers.

05:25.411 --> 05:26.497
Stop!

05:26.522 --> 05:27.854
And it'd be a really cute baby.

05:27.879 --> 05:30.230
I can't handle the
clock resetting to zero.

05:30.255 --> 05:31.325
I mean, for the first three months,

05:31.350 --> 05:32.234
you can't even work.

05:32.259 --> 05:33.624
Remember Caitlin's terrible twos?

05:33.649 --> 05:34.950
What about her effing fours?

05:34.975 --> 05:37.251
She used to fill her pull-up and
throw it at me. Remember that?

05:37.276 --> 05:39.435
- It was so cute.
- No, I'm serious, Maggie.

05:39.460 --> 05:41.432
Oh, come on,
everything's gonna be fine, really.

05:41.459 --> 05:42.490
Hey.

05:42.515 --> 05:43.737
Got it.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.599
A digital pregnancy test?

05:46.624 --> 05:49.358
Yeah, the lady said it
was the best one, so.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.850
This says I have to download an app.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.007
What, do you, like, pee on your phone?

05:52.032 --> 05:54.973
No, you pee on the stick
which uses Bluetooth

05:54.998 --> 05:56.798
to send the results to
an app on your phone.

05:56.823 --> 05:58.890
- Seriously?
- Yeah, but "The app provides"

05:58.915 --> 06:01.575
"distractions to reduce
stress while waiting," so.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.873
What kind of distractions?

06:03.985 --> 06:06.810
Wait, can people really not wait
three minutes without having...

06:06.835 --> 06:09.050
Aw, look, now the puppy's
licking the kitty.

06:09.075 --> 06:10.050
Oh, my...

06:11.766 --> 06:13.657
- Oh. Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

06:13.682 --> 06:16.318
Oh, my God, could we just view
the fricking results already?

06:17.216 --> 06:18.803
- Go.
- Ready?

06:18.828 --> 06:20.284
Okay.

06:21.907 --> 06:24.536
- Okay.
- Yay.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.391
All right. Yay.

06:26.416 --> 06:28.689
- Yay, yay! See?
- Yes, mm. Yeah.

06:28.714 --> 06:31.254
Thank God!

06:32.769 --> 06:34.513
Could you imagine a toddler
running around here?

06:34.538 --> 06:36.657
- Kind of. Diaper duty.
- Stop!

06:36.682 --> 06:38.985
Well, I mean...
Well, you've done this already.

06:45.776 --> 06:47.644
Really? Now?

06:47.669 --> 06:50.085
I just need you to assure
me that you're being safe.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.962
Oh, did you not see the
gift-wrapped box of condoms

06:52.987 --> 06:54.304
that Maggie gave me?

06:54.329 --> 06:56.463
You're so welcome, honey.
You want some more?

06:56.488 --> 06:59.109
Maggie. Unless you do? You can tell me.

06:59.134 --> 07:01.864
Mom, I'm covered.
Do you want to see my drawer?

07:01.889 --> 07:03.911
- Yes.
- No, it's okay. I trust you.

07:03.936 --> 07:05.702
You know, I'm a little
old for "the talk."

07:05.727 --> 07:07.156
We had it in seventh grade.

07:07.181 --> 07:09.710
I know,
but you're never too old for a reminder.

07:09.735 --> 07:11.946
Noted. Bye, mom.

07:11.971 --> 07:13.849
Bye. I love you.

07:14.329 --> 07:15.585
Oy.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.204
Mom.

07:20.794 --> 07:23.714
Look, while you're on a tear,
I've got a loose niece

07:23.739 --> 07:25.733
in the Rockaways that
could use a talking to.

07:25.758 --> 07:27.422
I know, it's just that pregnancy test

07:27.447 --> 07:30.079
really scared me. I've never
been more relieved in my life.

07:30.104 --> 07:32.650
Well, I don't think
Josh was so relieved.

07:32.675 --> 07:34.104
I mean, didn't you notice?

07:34.129 --> 07:35.986
He was probably just freaked out.

07:36.011 --> 07:38.400
He looked kind of bummed, actually.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.689
Well, he's not ready for a kid.

07:40.715 --> 07:42.689
And he knows that I'm
not up for it again.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.296
I mean, we talked about it.

07:45.101 --> 07:48.817
Well, as long as you talked about it.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.362
We did.

07:56.036 --> 07:58.409
That's all for new
material from our imprint.

07:58.434 --> 07:59.856
Great, thanks.

07:59.882 --> 08:02.703
Just one more thing.
I would like to reiterate

08:02.728 --> 08:05.840
my request for Millennial
to have a larger presence

08:05.865 --> 08:08.258
at book fairs and literary festivals.

08:08.479 --> 08:10.481
I'll think about it.

08:10.793 --> 08:13.385
We talked to editors from five different

08:13.410 --> 08:15.186
independent publishing
houses last night.

08:15.211 --> 08:18.379
We're the only ones who didn't
go to Frankfurt or London.

08:18.404 --> 08:20.715
Readers are responding
to Millennial's books.

08:20.740 --> 08:23.195
We just got great press
in a national magazine...

08:23.220 --> 08:27.450
If you're referring to "EW,"
I think that Random House got

08:27.475 --> 08:29.851
a bigger bounce from that than we did.

08:30.951 --> 08:33.852
I don't see why you
need to fly to Europe

08:33.876 --> 08:36.739
for a week of partying
in overpriced hotels.

08:36.764 --> 08:38.349
It doesn't need to be international...

08:38.374 --> 08:41.764
I said I'd think about it.

08:43.485 --> 08:46.352
Moving on. Diana?

08:46.506 --> 08:50.475
Well, in another coup
for "P is for Pigeon,"

08:50.500 --> 08:54.455
the Audubon Society has
decided to honor Mary Quigley.

08:54.480 --> 08:57.332
We purchased a table,
and I invite you all to attend,

08:57.357 --> 08:59.467
and I encourage you to bring a plus one.

08:59.492 --> 09:02.187
I needn't remind you of
the paltry attendance

09:02.212 --> 09:04.771
to last month's "ReachOut
and Read" benefit

09:04.797 --> 09:08.355
when I sat at an empty
table with Trisha from HR

09:08.380 --> 09:10.755
and her Tinder date, Dwayne.

09:10.780 --> 09:13.671
Got it. Everyone sign up, bring dates.

09:13.696 --> 09:15.588
I hope to see you all there.
That's it for now.

09:18.095 --> 09:20.209
Charles, a word?

09:20.234 --> 09:21.933
Yeah?

09:21.958 --> 09:25.687
I was so sorry to hear
that things didn't work out

09:25.712 --> 09:28.063
between you and Radha.

09:28.422 --> 09:29.722
Oh, well...

09:29.747 --> 09:31.814
You know I've always
had a wonderful time

09:31.847 --> 09:33.459
being your date at these events...

09:33.640 --> 09:34.689
Date?

09:34.714 --> 09:36.969
But I've just started seeing someone.

09:36.994 --> 09:39.233
A... a doctor.

09:39.258 --> 09:42.009
That's terrific.

09:42.034 --> 09:44.234
Oh, it's just in the brand new phase

09:44.259 --> 09:46.981
where everything is... so fun.

09:47.005 --> 09:49.536
Anyway, I just didn't want
you to be caught off-guard.

09:49.789 --> 09:52.985
I'm sure we can squeeze in
a chair for you next to us.

09:53.025 --> 09:55.249
I look forward to meeting him.

09:55.726 --> 09:59.250
Oh, and Diana,
can you make sure there are two chairs?

09:59.275 --> 10:00.704
I'll be bringing a date as well.

10:00.823 --> 10:02.849
Excellent.

10:16.673 --> 10:19.231
It is amazing how much these bird lovers

10:19.256 --> 10:22.625
look like actual birds.
Look at the beak on that one.

10:22.650 --> 10:24.410
And how about old Owl Eyes over there?

10:24.435 --> 10:26.706
You think his head actually
spins all the way around?

10:27.504 --> 10:29.693
Judgment is a powerful
way of keeping people

10:29.718 --> 10:30.971
at arm's length.

10:30.996 --> 10:31.940
Don't analyze me.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.571
You won't even tell me
what's in your lemon curd.

10:33.596 --> 10:36.027
One cranberry, two sprigs of mint.

10:36.052 --> 10:39.564
2:00, black dress,
antiperspirant streaks.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.266
- Yeah, it's just coming.
- Deviled eggs

10:44.291 --> 10:46.349
at a bird fund raiser? Okay.

10:46.374 --> 10:48.897
Wouldn't it be awesome
if humans could lay eggs?

10:48.943 --> 10:51.347
We just could trade off sitting on 'em,
you know,

10:51.372 --> 10:52.301
share the work.

10:52.326 --> 10:55.378
Yeah, but then we'd have to
throw up into their mouths.

10:55.403 --> 10:57.052
- Well, I mean.
- Guys?

10:57.077 --> 10:58.942
- Hey.
- The Paris Review party made

10:58.967 --> 11:00.525
- "Page Six."
- What?

11:00.550 --> 11:02.446
- So did Josh.
- Oh.

11:02.471 --> 11:04.004
Oh, dope, they mention Inkburg.

11:04.029 --> 11:05.628
Yeah, why should Colin
get all the press?

11:05.653 --> 11:06.854
Hey, where is Colin?

11:06.879 --> 11:08.760
I don't know. He's
supposed to meet me here.

11:10.209 --> 11:11.672
Are those chicken wings?

11:11.696 --> 11:13.056
They can't be. Who catered this,

11:13.081 --> 11:14.614
a litter of cats?

11:14.639 --> 11:16.966
Well, there you are, Charles.

11:18.576 --> 11:20.877
So, no date after all?

11:20.902 --> 11:22.718
No, my date spotted

11:22.743 --> 11:25.338
a yellow-throated warbler on the way in.

11:25.363 --> 11:26.469
Oh, dear.

11:26.494 --> 11:28.258
Judging.

11:28.283 --> 11:29.411
Honey?

11:31.164 --> 11:34.200
Nicole is an avid bird watcher.

11:34.225 --> 11:35.813
She actually takes her field guide

11:35.838 --> 11:37.507
to Central Park every Saturday.

11:37.532 --> 11:39.899
Well, isn't that wonderful?

11:40.357 --> 11:43.251
This is Richard Caldwell...
Doctor Richard Caldwell.

11:43.276 --> 11:45.410
- Ph.D.
- Still counts.

11:45.435 --> 11:46.931
Charles Brooks.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.595
You realize that's not
a real bird, right?

11:49.620 --> 11:53.067
I do, but it's designer, so.

11:53.665 --> 11:56.691
- She is just adorable.
- Isn't she?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.061
Nicole's been coming to our office

11:58.086 --> 11:59.206
since she was three years old,

11:59.230 --> 12:00.580
and we are great pals, aren't we?

12:00.605 --> 12:02.363
- Remember when I...
- Liza!

12:02.388 --> 12:04.996
Hey!

12:05.109 --> 12:07.820
She's... she's adorable.

12:13.749 --> 12:15.802
Daddy, look, it's so beautiful.

12:15.827 --> 12:17.883
Yeah, it is.

12:18.307 --> 12:20.338
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

12:20.363 --> 12:21.696
Aw, it's fun for me.

12:26.887 --> 12:29.117
Hey. You here?

12:29.142 --> 12:31.229
I can't come, Kels.

12:31.254 --> 12:33.074
Pippa just gave me her editorial notes,

12:33.099 --> 12:36.394
and she says there are
inconsistencies with my timeline

12:36.419 --> 12:39.081
and the relationship between
Nick and his sister is murky.

12:39.316 --> 12:41.194
What does that even mean, murky?

12:41.234 --> 12:43.287
Maybe I should return the advance.

12:43.312 --> 12:44.384
No, Colin...

12:44.409 --> 12:45.711
They don't get the book!

12:45.736 --> 12:49.171
Colin, just... everything is
going to be okay, all right?

12:49.196 --> 12:50.807
Just hang tight until I get there.

12:50.832 --> 12:52.587
Something came up. I'll text you.

12:52.612 --> 12:53.941
Okay.

12:55.161 --> 12:57.271
Now can you do a butterfly?

12:57.517 --> 12:59.209
Depends.

12:59.234 --> 13:00.945
What's the butterfly's name?

13:01.152 --> 13:02.452
John.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.757
John the butterfly, coming right up.

13:06.330 --> 13:07.904
He's terrific with kids.

13:07.929 --> 13:09.913
Richard, I finally found
a decent assistant.

13:09.938 --> 13:11.564
Stop putting ideas in her head.

13:11.589 --> 13:12.963
You're right.

13:12.988 --> 13:16.670
They're young.
They have all the time in the world.

13:23.392 --> 13:25.855
How can they say they love it
and ask for this many changes?

13:25.880 --> 13:27.946
It's a great novel, Colin, all right,

13:27.971 --> 13:29.222
but everything can use improving.

13:29.247 --> 13:30.608
Yeah, but what if it's not great?

13:30.633 --> 13:33.467
What if it's all hype and this
is really a giant piece of shit?

13:33.783 --> 13:37.070
Every talented writer that
I know has that same fear.

13:37.095 --> 13:38.889
Yeah, but look at this.

13:40.095 --> 13:42.821
Hey, no editor expects a writer

13:42.846 --> 13:44.965
to make every single change.

13:45.146 --> 13:49.836
This, forget that, okay,
and this is just a minor rewording.

13:49.861 --> 13:51.244
Really?

13:51.269 --> 13:54.362
Yes, this is so do-able.

13:54.468 --> 13:57.332
We'll go it together, one-by-one.

13:57.918 --> 14:01.176
- Thank you.
- No problem.

14:01.943 --> 14:04.148
You're so rare...

14:04.173 --> 14:05.380
and generous...

14:05.405 --> 14:07.115
and extraordinary.

14:09.873 --> 14:15.339
And you are on a deadline.
Let's get to work.

14:16.948 --> 14:18.989
I'm so grateful to Empirical,

14:19.014 --> 14:23.253
and especially Diana Trout,
for taking a chance on my novel.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.268
And as a special salute,

14:25.293 --> 14:28.238
I would like to present
Diana with this gift.

14:29.338 --> 14:32.366
"P is for Pigeon" is about

14:32.391 --> 14:35.029
the world's last passenger pigeon,

14:35.053 --> 14:38.361
but since they're extinct now,
I'd love you to enjoy this...

14:39.930 --> 14:43.427
This equally magnificent creature.

14:43.451 --> 14:45.602
He may give you a hint

14:45.627 --> 14:47.861
about the subject for my next novel.

14:48.966 --> 14:52.013
I'd also like to thank my husband.

14:52.038 --> 14:54.636
He encouraged me to try something

14:54.661 --> 14:57.051
outside my comfort zone.

14:57.284 --> 15:00.140
Let go of what you think should happen

15:00.483 --> 15:04.029
and open yourself up
to the vast, rich world

15:04.054 --> 15:07.053
of possibility. Thank you.

15:15.049 --> 15:16.379
No, there's nothing wrong with it.

15:16.403 --> 15:19.667
It's just a parrot in my apartment.

15:19.692 --> 15:21.416
And I would like it to not be here.

15:21.441 --> 15:22.831
She's listening to you.

15:22.856 --> 15:24.611
Shh! Thank you.

15:25.932 --> 15:28.500
The Parrot Rescue said they
would take... take her.

15:28.525 --> 15:30.461
Let's get her quick
before we have to change

15:30.486 --> 15:32.160
the newspaper again.

15:32.184 --> 15:34.375
You've haven't even
given this bird a chance.

15:34.812 --> 15:36.176
I think you should reconsider.

15:36.201 --> 15:38.687
Oh, why?
Because she's a beautiful color green?

15:38.712 --> 15:41.750
I'm not a child, Richard, okay,
I know how much work a pet is.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.689
We could take care of her together.

15:43.714 --> 15:44.858
That's still a commitment.

15:44.883 --> 15:47.190
And what's wrong with a small,
bird-sized commitment?

15:47.215 --> 15:49.317
Look, Richard, please,
it doesn't make sense.

15:49.342 --> 15:52.498
No, what doesn't make sense
is a beautiful, talented woman

15:52.523 --> 15:55.536
hiding behind a big brick wall
and never letting anyone in.

15:57.821 --> 16:00.048
It's not brick.

16:00.073 --> 16:02.201
I don't like brick.

16:13.631 --> 16:15.838
I am co-habitating with a man.

16:15.863 --> 16:17.481
- What?
- Richard is moving in.

16:17.506 --> 16:19.353
Yeah, so I need you to
make a copy of my house key

16:19.378 --> 16:21.290
and contact my homeowners insurance.

16:21.315 --> 16:22.798
Oh, set up a lunch with Ilan.

16:22.824 --> 16:24.120
Ilan?

16:24.275 --> 16:25.839
My closet designer.

16:25.864 --> 16:28.414
So much to discuss. Come on.

16:28.439 --> 16:30.873
- Oh.
- Come!

16:34.478 --> 16:36.377
Kelsey,
I'm so glad we're finally doing this.

16:36.402 --> 16:39.746
Me too. If I had to lose the
biggest book of the year,

16:39.771 --> 16:41.170
at least I lost it to one of the best.

16:41.195 --> 16:43.126
Aw, sweet.

16:44.930 --> 16:48.252
- Team Colin.
- Go Team! Whoo!

16:48.277 --> 16:49.708
But even though we're on the same team,

16:49.733 --> 16:50.933
we have different roles.

16:50.957 --> 16:54.267
Redmond's the agent.
You're the girlfriend.

16:54.825 --> 16:57.627
- Right.
- And I'm the editor,

16:57.651 --> 16:59.838
so I hope that when Colin
submits his next draft

16:59.864 --> 17:03.397
to his editor, his girlfriend's
fingerprints aren't all over it.

17:04.902 --> 17:06.939
Pippa, I was just trying to help...

17:06.964 --> 17:09.069
Help, I know. I've seen this before.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.486
You must have too, I'm
sure, as an editor.

17:11.787 --> 17:13.968
You know how hard my job is

17:13.992 --> 17:16.901
without other voices
chiming in with opinions.

17:17.589 --> 17:19.444
You're right.

17:19.470 --> 17:22.813
You're the editor,
I'm the girlfriend, and...

17:23.271 --> 17:25.351
I will let you do your job.

17:25.980 --> 17:27.357
Thank you.

17:27.910 --> 17:30.806
God, I'm so sorry if that seemed harsh.

17:30.831 --> 17:32.886
We are just under the tightest deadline,

17:32.911 --> 17:34.812
and I had to say something
before the Hamptons.

17:34.837 --> 17:37.134
This would've been so much
more awkward in sarongs.

17:37.488 --> 17:39.500
- What?
- Hamptons Book Fair.

17:39.525 --> 17:42.828
I booked Colin on a few panels.
They practically begged me.

17:43.031 --> 17:45.995
Millennial's going, right?
It's gonna be huge this year.

17:46.020 --> 17:48.387
Of course.

17:53.732 --> 17:55.951
Hamptons Book Fair, I'm going.

17:56.844 --> 17:59.509
- Excuse me?
- Millennial needs a presence

17:59.525 --> 18:01.836
somewhere. I'm not
asking to go to Europe.

18:01.861 --> 18:02.959
The Hamptons is close,

18:02.984 --> 18:04.622
they're expanding the fair this year,

18:04.647 --> 18:07.147
and I'm doing it whether the
company pays for it or not.

18:07.230 --> 18:10.870
Millenial finally has momentum,
and I'm not going to waste it.

18:10.895 --> 18:12.710
All right, it's not about the partying,

18:12.735 --> 18:16.441
it's about visibility,
and Millennial needs to be visible.

18:17.955 --> 18:19.803
Like Colin?

18:21.831 --> 18:23.499
That book is going to be huge.

18:23.523 --> 18:25.853
And I hate that we don't have it.

18:25.878 --> 18:27.704
It's completely my fault.

18:29.296 --> 18:33.183
You're passionate, you
got excellent taste,

18:34.932 --> 18:38.697
And you're right,
Millennial needs to be visible.

18:40.282 --> 18:42.082
Show 'em we're still in the game.

18:43.886 --> 18:45.086
Kelsey?

18:45.111 --> 18:46.537
Uh, sorry, I'm sorry.

18:46.562 --> 18:48.889
I was just expecting more of a fight.

18:48.914 --> 18:52.386
So you don't want to
take yes as an answer?

18:52.411 --> 18:55.788
No. I mean, wait, yes, yes, I...

18:55.813 --> 18:59.636
Thank you, Charles. Thank you.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.283
So how long you gonna be gone?

19:05.308 --> 19:08.195
Just for a few days,
and it's only a short train ride away.

19:08.957 --> 19:10.868
I mean, it's not a huge book fair

19:10.893 --> 19:13.564
like Frankfurt or London,
but it'll be good to get

19:13.589 --> 19:15.585
- the imprint out there, you know?
- Yeah.

19:15.768 --> 19:19.092
Makes it more real. Kelsey's so excited.

19:19.394 --> 19:22.321
She should be, and so should you.

19:23.084 --> 19:25.374
I'm so proud of you, babe.

19:25.811 --> 19:27.637
Thank you.

19:28.355 --> 19:31.341
It is so sweet of you
to come walk me home.

19:31.366 --> 19:33.853
- What's the occasion?
- No occasion.

19:33.878 --> 19:35.677
It's no big deal.

19:37.522 --> 19:41.474
I don't know.
Maybe it is kind of a big deal.

19:42.046 --> 19:45.170
Look, I got to be honest with you, Liza.

19:45.905 --> 19:50.274
I know... I know you were
relieved about not being pregnant,

19:50.299 --> 19:52.946
and I... I thought I was too,

19:52.971 --> 19:56.474
but these last few days,
I can't stop thinking about it.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.506
We would be...

19:59.358 --> 20:02.074
incredible parents, you know?

20:02.956 --> 20:05.225
I thought we talked about this.

20:05.407 --> 20:07.050
Yeah, I know, but there's...

20:07.368 --> 20:10.459
There's lots of women in
their 40s having kids,

20:10.484 --> 20:12.465
you know?

20:12.855 --> 20:16.994
And can you imagine our kid?

20:17.019 --> 20:18.010
I mean, just stop.

20:18.034 --> 20:19.585
Just think about it for a minute,

20:19.611 --> 20:22.290
'cause you can really think about her...

20:22.315 --> 20:24.362
Her, him, or...

20:24.387 --> 20:27.561
Josh.

20:27.671 --> 20:29.474
You're still so young. I know.

20:29.499 --> 20:30.546
I know. I...

20:30.571 --> 20:34.281
Look, I never thought I'd
be talking about kids yet.

20:34.306 --> 20:35.799
You know?

20:36.510 --> 20:40.682
Oh, I never thought I'd meet
somebody like you either.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.433
Excuse me.

20:44.124 --> 20:45.754
What's going on?

20:45.779 --> 20:48.226
- Manhattanhenge.
- What's Manhattanhenge?

20:48.251 --> 20:50.242
It's when the sun lines
up with the street grid

20:50.267 --> 20:51.613
and sets exactly in
between the buildings.

20:51.638 --> 20:54.333
Doesn't happen very often. It's amazing.

20:54.359 --> 20:56.846
Come on.

21:04.014 --> 21:05.261
Sorry.

21:09.154 --> 21:10.011
That's a sign.

21:10.205 --> 21:12.139
You see that, right?

21:12.187 --> 21:14.227
It's just like us.

21:14.619 --> 21:19.419
We met at the perfect moment,

21:19.444 --> 21:22.611
and we can have everything.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.091
It's all lined up.

21:30.875 --> 21:32.904
Really, it's beautiful.

21:33.305 --> 21:39.732
