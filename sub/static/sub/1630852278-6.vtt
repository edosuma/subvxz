00:01.626 --> 00:04.838
- So you're just
living in the now?

00:04.838 --> 00:06.548
- Yes.

00:06.548 --> 00:09.759
- Okay.
So what the fuck does that mean?

00:09.759 --> 00:12.971
- It means that I'm gonna
stop fixating on the past

00:12.971 --> 00:15.140
and what I did to my brother

00:15.140 --> 00:18.143
and how that may or may not have
fucked up my family's future,
okay?

00:18.143 --> 00:20.645
And instead, I'm just gonna live
in the now, okay?

00:20.645 --> 00:24.065
No past, no future,
just the current moment.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.859
- My uncle does something like
that. - Really?

00:25.859 --> 00:27.569
- Yeah, he has Alzheimer's.

00:27.569 --> 00:28.987
- Fuck you.

00:28.987 --> 00:31.823
Look, I'm serious, man.
I'm making a change here,

00:31.823 --> 00:35.076
- Wait, so you learned all this
from an Edgar Toll podcast?

00:35.076 --> 00:37.537
- Eckhart Tolle, and
it was an audiobook,

00:37.537 --> 00:40.165
and he's German as fuck,
and he's a genius.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.584
- What makes him a genius?

00:42.584 --> 00:46.004
- Okay, for one, he's the first
to figure out that the voice in
your head?

00:46.004 --> 00:47.839
That's not really you.

00:47.839 --> 00:50.425
You are the one listening
to the voice in your head.

00:50.425 --> 00:53.011
- So now you got
voices in your head.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.512
- What?
No, we all do, okay?

00:54.512 --> 00:55.680
There's tons of 'em.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.433
It's like, "Do
this, don't do that,

00:58.433 --> 01:00.435
"jerk off, don't jerk off,

01:00.435 --> 01:02.604
"sit on your left hand till it
goes numb and jerk off that way,

01:02.604 --> 01:03.980
do I get the steak or
do I get the salad?"

01:03.980 --> 01:05.148
It's constant, man.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.983
- Hmm.

01:06.983 --> 01:08.651
I've been meaning to
ask you something.

01:08.651 --> 01:11.237
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:11.237 --> 01:13.698
- Okay, um...
okay, all right, all right.

01:13.698 --> 01:16.826
One of the voices in my head
always wants me to be late,
right?

01:16.826 --> 01:20.580
And this fucker in my head, he
just keeps winning over and
over,

01:20.580 --> 01:23.541
and what I realized is, I don't
have to listen to him anymore,

01:23.541 --> 01:25.627
because he's not me.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.546
I'm the one that
he's making late.

01:28.546 --> 01:29.964
- Wow.

01:29.964 --> 01:32.175
Well, if you're not listening
to the voices,

01:32.175 --> 01:34.886
then who are you listening to?

01:34.886 --> 01:37.972
- The listener.

01:37.972 --> 01:40.100
- You're listening
to the listener?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.935
- Well, no, no,
you don't even have to listen.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.686
You are the listener.

01:43.686 --> 01:46.147
That's the only person
you have to pay attention to.

01:46.147 --> 01:49.567
Kay, the listener has way better
instincts than the talkers.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.444
The talkers are
all fucking idiots.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.072
- They are, because
I--I mean, I get that,

01:54.072 --> 01:56.032
because I also--I have a
lot of voices in my head.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.951
I think one of 'em might be gay.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.619
- Yeah?

01:59.619 --> 02:02.455
- Yeah, and only when
he drinks, but...

02:02.455 --> 02:05.583
I mean, yeah, he's, like, super
gay. - Sure, yeah, yeah.

02:05.583 --> 02:09.671
♪ Now, now,
now, now, now ♪

02:12.841 --> 02:14.551
♪ We just
getting home ♪

02:14.551 --> 02:15.552
♪ Friends but only
for the night ♪

02:15.552 --> 02:17.387
- Tea with a
dash of honey.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.806
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.558
Thank you for meeting me.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.227
It's very cool of you.

02:24.227 --> 02:28.064
- Well, I know you're
going through a tough time,
so...

02:28.064 --> 02:30.275
how are you?

02:30.275 --> 02:32.610
- I'm pretty good.
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.445
- Are you living
with your mother?

02:34.445 --> 02:36.781
- God, no, no.
I'm a big boy.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.741
Found a little spot
in the Snyder building.

02:38.741 --> 02:40.869
- Oh, that's a really nice
building. You can afford that?

02:40.869 --> 02:42.579
- Mom's paying.

02:42.579 --> 02:45.748
But I'm gonna pay her back
with interest.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.417
- Your mom's charging
you interest?

02:47.417 --> 02:49.085
- It's just an expression.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.504
- Well, good for you.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.134
- Ken, I'm sorry
about the funeral.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.136
I shouldn't have tackled him.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.929
- It's okay.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.390
- I made a huge mistake.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.601
- No, really, it's fine.
Kyle's over it.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.686
- No, not that.
I...

03:06.686 --> 03:08.479
I made a mistake
when I let you go,

03:08.479 --> 03:12.692
and so I'm here to ask for your
forgiveness for the cheating.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.986
- My forgiveness?

03:14.986 --> 03:17.989
But I'm the one
who cheated on you.

03:17.989 --> 03:21.117
- That's true, but
it was my fault, kay?

03:21.117 --> 03:24.287
I was the one who
messed with the formula.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.998
- The formula.

03:26.998 --> 03:31.085
- Yeah, okay, you know
the Pythagorean theorem?

03:31.085 --> 03:33.504
- Yeah, A squared plus B
squared-- - Squared equals C
squared.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.673
- Yeah. - Exactly. That's what
happened to us.

03:35.673 --> 03:38.968
"A" being, you know,
me being an asshole

03:38.968 --> 03:42.347
plus B, me being a
fucking buzzkill,

03:42.347 --> 03:45.058
equals C, cheating.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.394
But it was all my fault,
and it's a natural law,

03:48.394 --> 03:51.689
so you can't argue with it.

03:51.689 --> 03:55.652
- Wow, that does
kind of make sense.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.947
- Yeah, which is why I'm
asking you to forgive me.

03:58.947 --> 04:03.785
- You do realize Kyle
and I are engaged, right?

04:03.785 --> 04:05.620
Oh, come on.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.874
I know me being with Kyle
affected your decision-making at
work

04:09.874 --> 04:11.584
which led to that whole--

04:11.584 --> 04:13.544
how is that going, by the way?

04:13.544 --> 04:16.589
Are you still in court?
- No, no, that's long gone.

04:16.589 --> 04:20.093
I paid a fine, took a little
lifetime ban. Everything's great
there.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.595
Ken,

04:22.595 --> 04:24.138
you're the only person
I've ever really cared about.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.354
- But I know you, Ed.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.190
You obsess over things,

04:34.190 --> 04:37.151
and it would always be
in the back of your mind,

04:37.151 --> 04:40.863
and whenever we'd get in an
argument, you'd just bring up me
being--

04:40.863 --> 04:44.200
- With my archenemy Kyle?
No way, that's not me!

04:44.200 --> 04:48.162
I'm not in the back of my mind
anymore, and I'm not in the
front.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.581
I'm in the middle of it.
I'm right here.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.250
I'm...

04:54.544 --> 04:56.796
Okay, okay, remember when we
went to New York to see
"Hamilton?"

04:56.796 --> 04:58.089
- Of course.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.507
- And remember how
Hamilton's wife forgave him

04:59.507 --> 05:01.634
even after all the shit he did?

05:01.634 --> 05:04.721
Well, I'm Hamilton's wife
and you're Hamilton.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.767
- Wait, no, Hamilton
went with hookers

05:09.767 --> 05:12.312
while he was married.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.689
I just went out with your
coworker. - Archenemy.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.983
- Wait, you said that
this wasn't my fault

05:16.983 --> 05:18.860
and that you were the one
who messed with the formula.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.112
- No, I did, I absolutely did,
but it still happened.

05:23.239 --> 05:26.159
It's like the Manson
girls, you know?

05:26.159 --> 05:28.411
I'm sure they were coerced into
doing what they did, but they
still did it.

05:28.411 --> 05:31.664
- Wow.
So now I'm a Manson girl.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.458
- Wait, no--the pretty one.
- No.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.917
- Wait--okay, no, no, no, no,
go back to the--

05:34.917 --> 05:36.794
you're way more like Hamilton!

05:36.794 --> 05:39.213
He was a genius who created
our whole financial system.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.257
That's you, that's-- remember
when that--that was you.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.884
- You know what, and I knew
you could never get over this.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.510
I'm done.
- Over what?

05:44.510 --> 05:45.345
I don't even know
what we're talking...

05:53.478 --> 05:55.605
- Edward.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.024
I'll need you to be at the
office at 12:30 tomorrow.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.234
We're meeting with
the Tisco people.

06:00.234 --> 06:03.738
- I was gonna go out for lunch.
Why do I have to be there?

06:03.738 --> 06:06.699
- Because if they buy us out,
I'll need your signature.

06:06.699 --> 06:10.036
Arthur says the trust requires
two family members to sign.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.338
- I'm available as well.
- Nuts and bolts.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.590
- Hey, sorry I'm late.

06:22.590 --> 06:26.052
Continue, please.
Please, continue.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.054
April Becker.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.680
- Hey, Ed.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.392
- What--what are you doing here?

06:32.392 --> 06:35.436
- Well, my dad is thinking
about buying your company,

06:35.436 --> 06:37.563
and since I'm his
daughter slash lawyer,

06:37.563 --> 06:38.856
I'm gonna make sure you and
your mom don't rip him off.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.485
- Mr. Becker.
Ed Poole.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.446
- Yes, I remember you, Ed.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.573
When you were a little kid, you
used to egg my house every
Halloween.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.785
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.912
Stupid kid stuff.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.123
I was just trying
to get April's attention.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.250
-
Great strategy, huh?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.043
Impress a girl by
egging her house.

06:59.043 --> 07:02.922
- No, by pissing off her dad.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.300
By the way, April,
you're looking very corporate-y.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.553
In, like, a great way.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.972
Wow, you're a lawyer!
- Yeah.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.392
- That's--that's not surprising.
You were always so smart.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.310
Weren't you, like, valedictorian
of our class or something?

07:16.310 --> 07:17.728
- No, not even close.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.898
- Well, I'm pretty
sure I voted for you.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.443
- Well, actually, we have to get
going. - Yes.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.736
- Ah, so--but I'm really excited
about this.

07:25.736 --> 07:27.780
- Yes.
- Oh, we are so excited.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.782
- April's gonna draw up
the purchase agreement

07:29.782 --> 07:32.034
and after conducting
some due diligence,

07:32.034 --> 07:35.329
hopefully we'll close
by the end of the month.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.081
Fantastic.
- It's good seeing you.

07:37.081 --> 07:39.167
- You too.
- Yeah.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.710
Bye.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.170
It was lovely
seeing you again too, April.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.546
Thank you.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.674
- We look forward to it again.
Drive safe.

07:46.674 --> 07:49.469
Fuck yeah!

07:54.474 --> 07:56.976
- Yo.
How'd it go with Kendra?

07:56.976 --> 07:58.811
I am living
in the now

07:58.811 --> 08:02.356
and Kendra is having difficulty
getting over the past.

08:02.356 --> 08:05.735
And speaking of the past,

08:05.735 --> 08:09.697
I randomly just had a meeting
with April fucking Becker.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.908
- A meeting with April Becker!

08:11.908 --> 08:13.284
- Double Decker Becker?

08:13.284 --> 08:15.703
No fucking way.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.747
Ed, how's she looking, man?

08:17.747 --> 08:19.790
- I am guessing
you would approve.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.876
So did you
ask her out?

08:21.876 --> 08:23.461
- No.
What did I just say?

08:23.461 --> 08:25.505
I'm trying to get Kendra back.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.674
Wait, what happened to
all this future/past shit you
just told me about?

08:28.674 --> 08:30.718
- No, April is the
one from the past.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.136
- Not anymore.

08:32.136 --> 08:35.097
I mean, April's here now.

08:35.097 --> 08:39.143
- Yo, Ed, the now is teeing
it up for you right now

08:39.143 --> 08:41.854
with none other than Double
Decker Becker, Eddie!

08:41.854 --> 08:43.606
- Wait, no, no, I can't.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.567
I--it's a business relationship.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.152
Ask her to a
business dinner.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.862
- What the hell
are you looking at?

08:49.862 --> 08:52.490
Aren't they, like,
obligated to say yes to that
kind of thing?

08:52.490 --> 08:55.493
- Me?
No, I--sorry, I wasn't looking.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.869
- You got straight eyes?

08:56.869 --> 08:58.204
- Straight eyes?
No, I don't have any--

08:58.204 --> 08:59.872
wait--no, what are
you--I didn't--

09:00.748 --> 09:02.250
- What'd he say?

09:02.250 --> 09:04.877
- Yo, Ed, talk into
the phone, man.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.129
We can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.798
Hal, who called her
Double Decker Becker?

09:08.798 --> 09:10.841
- I did.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.552
- Okay, but what
does that even mean?

09:12.552 --> 09:15.346
- Means she got big tits.
- I hear ya.

09:15.346 --> 09:18.516
But Double Decker Becker makes
it sound like she has one tit on
top of the other,

09:18.516 --> 09:21.269
or two rows of tits.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.521
[shouting over phone
continues] - Oh, my God.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.731
Oh, man, it totally does.
- Yeah.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.442
- Aww, that's why that never
caught on! - Probably.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.903
- Jesus, I should've been
calling her Upper Decker Becker.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.822
- What the fuck, man?
- Spread your fingers.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.865
- What the--spread my--okay,
