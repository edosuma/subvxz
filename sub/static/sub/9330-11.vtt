WEBVTT

00:00.668 --> 00:03.101
And I got some tea here.

00:03.153 --> 00:06.111
Now, Emma, I know this
isn't the first time

00:06.211 --> 00:08.728
you and I have had breakfast
while waiting for your dad

00:08.764 --> 00:09.796
to come home from a hook-up.

00:12.100 --> 00:15.001
But if all goes well with him
and Zoey, will you promise me

00:15.003 --> 00:16.970
you'll still make time
for your Uncle Tucker?

00:17.005 --> 00:17.988
Yes.

00:19.942 --> 00:21.975
Sure, don't tell me
about your boyfriend,

00:22.027 --> 00:24.945
and I won't tell you anything. No,
let's never tell anybody anything.

00:26.848 --> 00:27.881
Ben, what are you doing?

00:27.916 --> 00:30.817
Aren't you supposed to
be upstairs with Zoey?

00:30.819 --> 00:33.720
And if you're not at Zoey's,
why am I babysitting your kid?

00:34.873 --> 00:35.822
Hold that thought.

00:37.259 --> 00:38.775
Ben, hey. Can we talk?

00:38.810 --> 00:40.160
Absolutely. Hey, quick question:

00:40.162 --> 00:41.778
In the last 48 hours,

00:41.813 --> 00:43.980
did you happen to get back
together with your kid's dad,

00:44.016 --> 00:45.065
a guy I've never even heard of?

00:45.067 --> 00:47.000
Yes, but if I could
just explain it...

00:49.154 --> 00:50.987
You catch that? 'Cause
I can call her back

00:51.023 --> 00:53.106
and slam the door in her face again.

00:53.141 --> 00:54.908
I'm good.

00:56.044 --> 00:56.993
You good?

00:57.045 --> 00:58.044
Yes.

00:59.081 --> 01:00.797
We good.

Danny: Riley, can we please just talk?

01:14.430 --> 01:15.479
Talk? Or make excuses?

01:15.514 --> 01:17.397
Because I'm pretty sure
I've heard everything.

01:17.433 --> 01:18.565
Guys? Can you just hold
on for two more floors?

01:18.601 --> 01:20.350
It was an awkward night,

01:20.402 --> 01:21.485
followed by a very awkward bus ride,

01:21.520 --> 01:23.403
followed by an even
more awkward cab ride,

01:23.439 --> 01:24.727
so if you could just
keep it together until...

01:24.753 --> 01:25.464
(elevator bell dings)

01:25.491 --> 01:26.440
Oh, thank God.

01:27.526 --> 01:30.327
Babe, come on, please just talk to me!

01:30.362 --> 01:31.361
I mean, we're home now,

01:31.413 --> 01:32.529
so let's go inside
and sort all this out.

01:32.581 --> 01:34.414
Actually, I'm home.

01:34.450 --> 01:35.532
Not sure where you live anymore.

01:35.584 --> 01:37.501
Oh, maybe Sam will let you

01:37.536 --> 01:38.502
sleep with her again.

01:41.373 --> 01:43.340
(growling)

01:43.375 --> 01:44.541
(growling)

01:44.593 --> 01:47.461
(yelling)

01:50.382 --> 01:51.465
I'll bet sometimes you wish

01:51.467 --> 01:52.549
you were adopted, huh?

01:55.521 --> 01:58.388
I can't find my toothbrush!

02:00.359 --> 02:02.359
(yelling)

02:02.394 --> 02:04.478
I can't find my conditioner!

02:05.944 --> 02:07.694
Riley and I had a fight.

02:07.696 --> 02:08.695
I don't want to talk about it.

02:08.747 --> 02:09.829
I will be in my room.

02:09.865 --> 02:11.865
Uh, remember how you
couldn't find your toothbrush?

02:11.867 --> 02:13.700
You're not gonna find your room, either.

02:13.702 --> 02:15.752
- Sam lives here.
- (Yelling)

02:16.838 --> 02:17.837
The good news is,

02:17.873 --> 02:18.872
your mom's in another country,

02:18.924 --> 02:20.707
so you could just stay there.

02:20.759 --> 02:24.711
Actually, that's great
news for all of us.

02:24.713 --> 02:25.845
One, two, three, four,

02:25.881 --> 02:28.715
Bonnie's back with gifts galore.

02:29.851 --> 02:31.718
Five, six, seven, eight...

02:31.720 --> 02:32.852
Peru sucked.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.940
Brad wasn't there, so I came home.

02:36.975 --> 02:37.891
Well, go back.

02:39.778 --> 02:42.729
Okay? Keep looking. It's a big country.

02:43.899 --> 02:45.899
Oh, I found him...

02:45.901 --> 02:47.734
in the Dallas airport.

02:47.786 --> 02:50.704
We rekindled our romance
in the handicapped stall.

02:51.740 --> 02:52.906
Thank God for all those handles.

02:57.779 --> 02:59.663
Hey, how was the Hamptons?

02:59.715 --> 03:01.648
Here! Thought I'd save you the trip.

03:01.683 --> 03:03.049
You're probably too weak from lying!

03:04.720 --> 03:06.987
Riley! Please! Come on!

03:08.073 --> 03:09.923
I feel like I've missed something.

03:11.893 --> 03:13.093
Dude, what is wrong with me?

03:13.128 --> 03:14.811
Can't believe I picked Zoey,

03:14.846 --> 03:15.895
the girl I met three months ago,

03:15.947 --> 03:17.831
over Sam, the girl
I've been obsessed with

03:17.883 --> 03:18.898
since high school

03:18.934 --> 03:20.867
who crawled naked into my bed.

03:20.919 --> 03:24.721
(emphasizing) Naked girl in... my bed!

03:26.875 --> 03:30.710
You know, you could've let Sam
down after you got down, right?

03:30.746 --> 03:32.679
I know! Trust me, I know.

03:33.799 --> 03:35.982
I didn't listen to you, and I'm sorry.

03:37.052 --> 03:38.985
When did I become the dumpee?

03:38.987 --> 03:40.670
I used to be the dump-er.

03:40.706 --> 03:41.938
The jerk.

03:41.973 --> 03:43.890
I wanna be the jerk again.

03:43.925 --> 03:46.976
We all do, man. We all do.

03:49.898 --> 03:51.848
Wait a minute.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.734
Nobody knows what a complete
and total idiot you were.

03:55.771 --> 03:57.837
You have the opportunity
to rewrite your story

03:57.873 --> 03:59.706
and become the dump-er.

03:59.708 --> 04:01.591
But Zoey lives in the building.

04:01.626 --> 04:02.659
She'll tell everyone the truth.

04:02.694 --> 04:04.677
Ah. But you're forgetting, my friend...

04:04.763 --> 04:08.581
you are holding one very powerful card.

04:08.617 --> 04:09.966
I delivered your baby!

04:10.018 --> 04:12.585
And I'll be grateful for that forever,

04:12.621 --> 04:13.987
but I'm not gonna pretend to be a couple

04:14.022 --> 04:15.638
just to protect your pride.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.957
If he had any pride, do you think
he'd be standing here right now?

04:17.959 --> 04:18.975
I think not.

04:22.798 --> 04:23.880
Look, Ben, I'm sorry.

04:23.932 --> 04:25.865
Aaron and I broke up
while I was pregnant,

04:25.901 --> 04:26.883
but then he got deployed,

04:26.918 --> 04:28.902
and I figured that it was over forever.

04:28.937 --> 04:31.621
But now he's back, and we're
gonna try and make it work.

04:31.673 --> 04:33.757
Well, I'm guessing that
Aaron doesn't have a clue

04:33.792 --> 04:35.775
that I exist and might
be a little surprised

04:35.811 --> 04:37.594
to hear that just days ago,

04:37.629 --> 04:39.062
you were kissing me in my shower.

04:39.114 --> 04:42.682
Wow! It really feels like
you're blackmailing me right now.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.017
See? She gets it.

04:45.620 --> 04:47.087
Look, all you gotta do
is pretend we're in love

04:47.122 --> 04:48.054
until I dump you.

04:48.106 --> 04:50.874
A little PDA, and I'll be on my way.

04:50.909 --> 04:53.042
Really? You don't find
this pathetic at all?

04:53.078 --> 04:56.763
You'd be surprised what
I don't find pathetic.

04:56.798 --> 04:58.865
And when Riley asked me if
I ever had feelings for Sam,

04:58.900 --> 05:00.834
I said no, because I
never had feelings for her.

05:00.836 --> 05:02.719
I mean, you're the one who taught me

05:02.771 --> 05:04.571
that you don't need feelings
to have sex with someone.

05:05.724 --> 05:07.991
And that's what you chose to listen to?

05:09.077 --> 05:10.560
What should I do?

05:10.595 --> 05:13.947
Listen, honey. You're Danny and Riley.

05:13.982 --> 05:15.915
You're meant to be together.

05:15.951 --> 05:17.016
I'm sure she'll come around,

05:17.018 --> 05:18.918
it'll just take some time.

05:18.954 --> 05:21.938
And until then I will be
right here by your side, okay?

05:21.973 --> 05:24.791
Thanks, Mom. I really appreciate it.

05:24.793 --> 05:26.810
Is it cool if I crash
with you for a bit?

05:26.862 --> 05:27.894
Or we could be proactive!

05:27.946 --> 05:30.830
You know what heals
wounds faster than time?

05:30.882 --> 05:35.835
Apologies, and lots of 'em. Sincere,
insincere... it doesn't really matter!

05:35.837 --> 05:37.871
I will help you figure out whatever crap

05:37.906 --> 05:40.590
you need to say to get her back!

05:45.030 --> 05:46.613
Hey, what's going on?

05:46.648 --> 05:47.647
You wanna know what's going on?

05:47.682 --> 05:49.032
I will tell you what's going on.

05:52.037 --> 05:53.920
Now would be great.

05:53.955 --> 05:55.839
Danny slept with Sam.

05:55.874 --> 05:57.857
What? Last night, how could he?

05:57.859 --> 05:59.792
No, not last night. In high school.

06:01.730 --> 06:02.695
Oh.

06:02.747 --> 06:03.830
Oh?

06:03.832 --> 06:05.765
All you can say is "Oh"?

06:05.817 --> 06:07.617
You should be furious.

06:07.669 --> 06:10.603
Annoyed, maybe. Furious?

06:10.639 --> 06:11.654
Furious was when I found out

06:11.690 --> 06:12.739
that you were dumping me for my brother.

06:12.741 --> 06:14.557
Okay, okay, okay.

06:14.593 --> 06:16.609
You're totally missing the point here.

06:16.611 --> 06:17.677
Hey, babe.

06:17.712 --> 06:19.012
Hey, there's my girl.

06:19.047 --> 06:21.581
I professed my love for her,
and she professed it back.

06:21.616 --> 06:23.032
She even cried. Isn't that right?

06:23.084 --> 06:24.884
I sure did.

06:33.845 --> 06:36.779
Okay, so, just a little public
display for my co-workers,

06:36.815 --> 06:37.914
and you'll never have to see me again.

06:37.966 --> 06:40.850
And if we're so in love,
then why are we breaking up?

06:40.902 --> 06:42.802
You're too clingy, or
I met someone hotter.

06:42.837 --> 06:44.771
Actually, I haven't decided.

06:44.773 --> 06:46.656
Hey, Tucker.

06:46.691 --> 06:48.041
Oh, hey, hey everybody, look!

06:48.043 --> 06:50.994
Look, it's Ben and his
new girlfriend, Zoey.

06:54.015 --> 06:55.081
Where the hell is everybody?

06:55.116 --> 06:57.984
I don't know. Sam's on
break, Carter called in sick.

06:58.019 --> 07:00.954
Oh, yeah, I'm supposed to be working.

07:00.956 --> 07:03.890
Ooh! Look, there's someone
I give a crap about, come on.

07:04.910 --> 07:06.876
Hey... you know that guy?

07:06.928 --> 07:08.845
Yeah. That's Ben. He owns this place,

07:08.897 --> 07:10.863
and that's his girlfriend Zoey.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.682
Oh, really.

07:12.717 --> 07:14.817
Yeah. Really.

07:14.869 --> 07:17.637
Who are you, Nosey Nancy?

07:17.689 --> 07:19.572
The father of her child.

07:19.574 --> 07:20.657
Uh-oh.

07:20.709 --> 07:22.559
That ain't good.

07:22.594 --> 07:24.627
Oh, yeah. Apparently,
she's been in love with me

07:24.663 --> 07:25.912
since the moment she set eyes on me.

07:25.947 --> 07:28.581
Took me a little while to
come around, but here I am.

07:28.617 --> 07:29.032
Hey.

07:30.068 --> 07:31.901
- Aaron?
- What the hell is going on?

07:31.937 --> 07:33.019
I thought we talked through everything.

07:33.021 --> 07:34.954
No, Aaron, please let me
explain, Ben was just...

07:35.006 --> 07:36.856
Hey, why don't we discuss this outside?

07:36.891 --> 07:37.890
Outside seems like a great option.

07:37.943 --> 07:39.742
Oh, there's no need to go outside.

07:40.829 --> 07:42.762
- Let's go.
- No, I swear, I didn't...

07:51.853 --> 07:55.538
I'm just saying, man, Zoey's
jealous ex punching you out

07:55.638 --> 07:56.937
really helps your story.

07:56.939 --> 07:59.840
This could not be going any better.

07:59.876 --> 08:00.858
I'm in jail.

08:00.910 --> 08:02.843
This could be going better!

08:04.764 --> 08:06.780
I should've just told people the truth.

08:06.833 --> 08:08.632
Well, I'd like to know the truth.

08:08.668 --> 08:09.783
Yeah, well, you ain't gonna get it,

08:09.819 --> 08:12.553
so just sit your ass
back down, jailbird.

08:12.605 --> 08:15.506
Tucker! Don't tease the Marine.

08:15.541 --> 08:16.607
Get me outta here, man.

08:18.694 --> 08:20.461
Thank you for your service.

08:22.828 --> 08:24.761
Riley should be home
for lunch any minute.

08:24.763 --> 08:26.746
Just remember... a good apology

08:26.782 --> 08:28.214
is nature's get-out-
of-jail-free card.

08:28.250 --> 08:31.151
Just say you're sorry, that you
don't want your stupid mistake

08:31.203 --> 08:33.720
to ruin 20 years of friendship and love,

08:33.755 --> 08:35.054
and that you miss her.

08:35.090 --> 08:36.105
And you're sure that'll work?

08:36.140 --> 08:37.957
Because I really need this to work.

08:37.993 --> 08:39.342
Trust your mother.

08:39.344 --> 08:43.078
I have been apologizing for stupid
stuff I've said my entire life.

08:43.081 --> 08:44.864
You never apologize.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.850
Well, I mean to, I just get so busy.

08:47.919 --> 08:49.911
Honey, everything is gonna be fine.

08:50.011 --> 08:52.995
Riley is just overreacting
and being hypersensitive.

08:53.047 --> 08:55.064
She'll come around, I promise.

08:55.099 --> 08:56.899
Oh, she's here. I'm goin' in.

08:56.951 --> 08:59.918
Go get her, go get her,
go get her, go get her!

08:59.954 --> 09:01.971
Riley, wait! I love you!

09:02.006 --> 09:06.275
And I'm so sorry. Please.
Don't let my stupid mistake

09:06.310 --> 09:08.260
ruin 20 years of love and friendship.

09:09.263 --> 09:10.229
I miss you.

09:13.084 --> 09:15.067
I miss you, too.

09:16.203 --> 09:19.004
I'm just... I'm so mixed
up and confused right now.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.990
That's okay. I get it.

09:21.042 --> 09:24.910
You're just... overreacting
and being hypersensitive.

09:27.064 --> 09:30.332
So... you think I'm overreacting?

09:30.384 --> 09:33.318
Does it look like I'm
overreacting to you?

09:33.371 --> 09:35.204
Yeah, a little,

09:35.239 --> 09:37.356
but it's okay. I love you anyway.

09:37.391 --> 09:39.324
Oh, you love me anyway,

09:39.360 --> 09:43.312
despite my terrible flaws. Oh,
wow, thank you. How lucky am I?

09:43.364 --> 09:45.130
I'd like to start over.

09:45.166 --> 09:48.077
Oh, no. No, no, no.
There is no starting over.

09:48.177 --> 09:50.227
I think you've said
everything you need to say,

09:50.279 --> 09:51.328
and by the way, I think any woman

09:51.363 --> 09:54.147
would react exactly the
same way I'm reacting.

09:54.183 --> 09:58.084
Uhh, I might have to
disagree with you there.

09:58.120 --> 10:01.104
I think most people probably
wouldn't think this is a big deal.

10:01.140 --> 10:03.423
Okay, well, you wanna know what I think?

10:08.397 --> 10:09.479
This feels like a trick.

10:12.317 --> 10:14.301
I cannot believe you're in jail.

10:14.336 --> 10:15.318
I'm so sorry...

10:15.354 --> 10:17.270
Oh, no, it's not you
I'm mad at, it's him.

10:17.306 --> 10:18.338
Oh, cool, then carry on.

10:18.373 --> 10:20.140
- Honey, I...
- Don't "honey" me.

10:20.142 --> 10:21.608
Don't anything me.

10:21.643 --> 10:24.161
You know, I don't want you around my
son if you can't control your temper

10:24.196 --> 10:26.163
over something as stupid as this.

10:26.198 --> 10:29.082
Zoey! Come on!

10:31.069 --> 10:32.152
See why I broke up with her?

10:34.089 --> 10:36.039
I'm such an idiot.

10:36.074 --> 10:38.158
I can't believe I messed
everything up again.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.509
I love Zoey, but I didn't think

10:39.561 --> 10:41.027
I was ready to be a father.

10:42.414 --> 10:44.297
I don't deserve to be Hunter's dad.

10:45.350 --> 10:48.301
Dude... no one is ready to be a dad.

10:49.371 --> 10:50.370
I wasn't.

10:52.140 --> 10:54.207
As far as deserving it, well...

10:54.243 --> 10:55.208
none of us do.

10:56.211 --> 10:58.111
Because it is the most incredible thing

10:58.146 --> 10:59.079
you'll ever do in your life.

11:00.199 --> 11:01.481
And that is why you have
to do everything you can

11:01.483 --> 11:02.465
to make it work.

11:04.519 --> 11:06.369
Thanks, man.

11:07.439 --> 11:09.406
- I hate you less now.
- (Door buzzes)

11:09.458 --> 11:11.291
And I you.

11:11.293 --> 11:12.425
(Bonnie and Tucker chattering)

11:12.461 --> 11:14.194
Where is he?

11:14.196 --> 11:16.296
Benjamin Bon Jovi Wheeler!

11:16.298 --> 11:18.148
If you were Danny, I would be

11:18.183 --> 11:19.316
so disappointed in you right now!

11:19.368 --> 11:21.117
Why'd you call her?

11:21.153 --> 11:23.186
Two years ago, she
gave me a hundred bucks

11:23.222 --> 11:24.237
to call if you were ever in jail.

11:24.289 --> 11:26.056
I had to honor our alliance.

11:27.159 --> 11:29.376
But don't you worry. I will not rest

11:29.476 --> 11:30.491
until I get you out of here.

11:30.527 --> 11:32.377
You are my number one priority,

11:32.412 --> 11:33.761
- and I will not stop until I make...
- (phone chimes)

11:33.797 --> 11:38.399
Oh, god. Riley says your brother's
upstairs and he's in trouble.

11:38.435 --> 11:39.684
You know what? I gotta go.

11:39.736 --> 11:41.669
You're just gonna leave me here?

11:41.671 --> 11:45.657
Ben? Did you not hear
me? Danny's in trouble!

11:52.682 --> 11:55.416
Riley! I got your message.

11:55.418 --> 11:57.502
I'm so happy that you wanna talk.

11:57.554 --> 12:00.521
Did you get my pizza with "I'm
sorry" spelled in pepperoni?

12:00.557 --> 12:02.373
I sure did.

12:04.377 --> 12:06.361
Oh. I thought you were done for the day.

12:06.363 --> 12:08.346
Kinda looks like you're
in the middle of a trial.

12:08.381 --> 12:09.347
Oh, I am.

12:09.399 --> 12:10.365
Yours.

12:11.701 --> 12:14.569
Danny Wheeler, you are on
trial for breaking my heart.

12:26.969 --> 12:29.769
And you're right... we
should ask other people

12:29.821 --> 12:30.854
if I overreacted.

12:30.906 --> 12:32.839
So you want to put me on a fake trial

12:32.891 --> 12:34.808
using fake jurors

12:34.860 --> 12:36.793
to decide whether
you're gonna forgive me?

12:36.845 --> 12:38.144
Pretty much. Yeah.

12:38.180 --> 12:41.031
But those jurors aren't
fake. I paid them $20

12:41.083 --> 12:43.099
to stay late and I even found a judge.

12:43.135 --> 12:45.151
I've agreed to remain
impartial, despite the fact

12:45.203 --> 12:46.920
that I was recently dumped

12:46.972 --> 12:48.121
by my lyin'
son-of-a-bitch ex.

12:52.060 --> 12:54.995
Obviously, I will be
acting as my own attorney,

12:55.030 --> 12:57.881
but don't worry, I
got you representation.

12:57.933 --> 12:59.049
Don't worry, baby!

12:59.084 --> 13:01.835
Your mama's right here and...
oh, god, son of a bitch!

13:06.158 --> 13:07.123
I'm a dead man.

13:08.777 --> 13:10.760
Look, man, this whole
thing was all my fault,

13:10.796 --> 13:13.029
Aaron just got back from
protecting our country,

13:13.098 --> 13:14.664
and now he's fighting for his true love,

13:14.700 --> 13:15.465
who's waiting for him at home

13:15.517 --> 13:16.683
with their newborn son right now.

13:16.685 --> 13:17.951
Is this all true?

13:17.986 --> 13:18.918
Yes, sir.

13:20.055 --> 13:23.923
All right, soldier. You're free to go.

13:23.959 --> 13:25.992
- Thank you.
- Anytime. You wanna share a cab?

13:26.028 --> 13:27.994
Not so fast, pretty boy.

13:28.030 --> 13:28.995
Get over here.

13:30.032 --> 13:31.765
The only thing you'll be sharing

13:31.767 --> 13:33.883
is a 4:00 baloney
sandwich... with that guy.

13:37.806 --> 13:41.691
Mr. Wheeler... when I
specifically asked you

13:41.743 --> 13:44.177
if you had feelings for
one Samantha Saffe...

13:44.212 --> 13:46.029
what did you say?

13:46.081 --> 13:47.981
Well, technically, I
never had feelings...

13:48.016 --> 13:50.116
It's a yes-or-no
question, Mr. Wheeler.

13:50.152 --> 13:51.935
I said no.

13:51.970 --> 13:55.955
But you did in fact sleep
with Sam in high school,

13:55.957 --> 13:56.956
did you not?

13:57.009 --> 13:58.808
Yes, but it meant nothing.

13:58.860 --> 14:00.727
(murmuring)

14:01.930 --> 14:05.782
So... Mr. Wheeler, if sleeping
with Sam "meant nothing,"

14:05.834 --> 14:07.684
then why didn't you tell me?

14:07.719 --> 14:09.135
(bangs) Objection!

14:10.155 --> 14:11.688
On what grounds?

14:11.723 --> 14:12.806
She's making my son look bad.

14:14.109 --> 14:16.076
Overruled.

14:16.128 --> 14:19.662
The only thing that makes
him look bad is clothes.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.983
Please answer the question, Mr. Wheeler.

14:23.985 --> 14:25.035
I don't know.

14:25.087 --> 14:26.086
I guess I didn't tell you,

14:26.088 --> 14:27.087
because I knew it would upset you.

14:27.089 --> 14:28.838
So you did lie.

14:28.874 --> 14:30.890
No! No, I told you I
never had feelings for Sam,

14:30.926 --> 14:32.926
and I didn't. It was just sex.

14:32.978 --> 14:34.944
(murmuring)

14:37.733 --> 14:38.732
Maybe it's time for you

14:38.734 --> 14:40.750
to throw yourself on
the mercy of the court,

14:40.802 --> 14:43.119
but, first let the court
put some lipstick on.

14:46.124 --> 14:48.691
Your witness, Mrs. Wheeler.

14:48.744 --> 14:50.710
It's about time. Was gettin' real tired

14:50.712 --> 14:51.711
of hearing other people talk.

14:51.763 --> 14:52.979
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.952
Mr. Wheeler, when you slept with Sam,

14:58.987 --> 15:00.820
were you single?

15:00.872 --> 15:02.822
Yeah. I was 17.

15:02.858 --> 15:06.910
But you were in love with someone else.

15:06.962 --> 15:08.928
I was in love with Riley.
I've been in love with her

15:08.930 --> 15:09.946
since I was six,

15:09.981 --> 15:11.831
but she never thought of
me as more than a friend.

15:11.883 --> 15:15.702
Objection! Counsel is not on trial here.

15:15.704 --> 15:17.804
Overruled! How could you not notice

15:17.806 --> 15:20.123
this beautiful gift
that the Lord gave us?

15:21.743 --> 15:24.994
Justice may be blind, but I'm not.

15:27.182 --> 15:28.948
And, Danny...

15:29.000 --> 15:30.116
for the majority of the time

15:30.168 --> 15:34.821
that you were in love with Ms. Perrin,

15:34.873 --> 15:39.025
would the rest of the world
have described her as... fat?

15:39.027 --> 15:40.877
- Oh! Objection!
- Mom! Come on!

15:40.929 --> 15:42.812
Exhibit A!

15:42.848 --> 15:44.697
A crude rendering

15:44.749 --> 15:46.733
of Riley in seventh grade.

15:48.770 --> 15:51.788
And my son... loved her anyway.

15:53.141 --> 15:55.742
The defense rests!

15:59.147 --> 16:02.198
Mrs. Wheeler, we have a real
situation with your other son.

16:02.298 --> 16:03.781
Who?

16:05.268 --> 16:06.233
- Ben.
- Oh.

16:06.269 --> 16:08.231
Your Majesty, I need a recess.

16:08.331 --> 16:10.231
Objection! There are no recesses.

16:10.233 --> 16:11.249
Okay, so you mean to tell me

16:11.301 --> 16:13.117
in your little made-up
girl-power trial

16:13.153 --> 16:15.036
there are no recesses?

16:15.071 --> 16:17.121
I'll allow it. 10-minute recess.

16:17.173 --> 16:19.941
Besides, they just
refilled the snack machine,

16:19.976 --> 16:22.076
and I gotta get there before
somebody takes all the Ding Dongs!

16:24.981 --> 16:28.049
Look, this man is a
respected business owner,

16:28.051 --> 16:31.319
and the only damages
incurred were to his own bar,

16:31.321 --> 16:34.856
which just makes him
stupid, not a criminal.

16:34.891 --> 16:38.176
As you can see, officer,
I've already served my time.

16:38.211 --> 16:39.310
Look, it's not his fault.

16:39.346 --> 16:41.279
My first kid was so huge,

16:41.331 --> 16:43.264
this one just slipped
out a little early.

16:43.299 --> 16:45.066
Head first!

16:45.101 --> 16:47.151
He should be wearing a helmet right now.

16:47.203 --> 16:50.138
Fine. Just go. I don't
wanna spend the next hour

16:50.206 --> 16:52.073
filling out paperwork.

16:52.108 --> 16:53.925
Plus, they just refilled
the snack machine.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.911
I gotta get there before
somebody takes all the Ding Dongs.

16:56.946 --> 16:57.995
Oh my god, thank you.

16:58.031 --> 16:59.080
All right, come on,
Ben, I need you upstairs.

17:03.953 --> 17:05.286
We dated, haven't we?

17:05.288 --> 17:06.270
Yes.

17:06.306 --> 17:07.821
You're still
pissed at me...

17:07.874 --> 17:08.839
- Yes.
- Okay, yeah.

17:12.278 --> 17:13.828
Ladies of the jury,

17:13.880 --> 17:16.814
I want you to imagine a
girl who, her whole life,

17:16.866 --> 17:19.166
had a best friend that she trusted

17:19.219 --> 17:20.167
more than anyone.

17:20.220 --> 17:23.070
And then one day, she
fell in love with him,

17:23.123 --> 17:26.973
and she felt safe and protected.

17:27.010 --> 17:30.878
Until... she found out he
had sex with her mortal enemy,

17:30.930 --> 17:32.046
and lied to her about it

17:32.048 --> 17:33.981
for seven years.

17:36.936 --> 17:40.955
So... ladies of the jury, I
ask you one simple question:

17:41.007 --> 17:45.910
How would you feel if
that girl... was you?

17:45.962 --> 17:48.262
Your honor! I have a surprise witness!

17:48.314 --> 17:50.198
- Oh, wow, I thought you were kidding.
- I know.

17:52.318 --> 17:53.301
What are you doing here?

17:53.353 --> 17:56.170
Uh, we're kind of wrapping it up,

17:56.206 --> 18:00.108
but I'll allow a little
eye candy for our jurors.

18:02.011 --> 18:03.094
(jokingly) Oops.

18:15.008 --> 18:17.959
Okay... so, Ben...

18:17.994 --> 18:20.845
would you please tell the jury

18:20.897 --> 18:23.231
your history with Miss Perrin?

18:24.284 --> 18:26.300
Okay... well, when we were kids,

18:26.302 --> 18:29.837
Danny was in love with Riley,
Riley was in love with me,

18:29.873 --> 18:32.240
and I was in love with a girl named Sam.

18:32.275 --> 18:34.242
But then I realized I did love Riley,

18:34.277 --> 18:37.111
and we dated for a couple of months.

18:37.147 --> 18:39.964
And Danny stood by and
watched, even though

18:39.999 --> 18:41.048
I know it killed him inside.

18:43.019 --> 18:46.971
And how are you related to Danny, Ben?

18:48.024 --> 18:48.973
He's my brother.

18:49.025 --> 18:50.024
- What?
- (Jury gasps)

18:50.026 --> 18:51.993
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

18:52.045 --> 18:54.896
Calm down, everyone,
It's not that weird.

18:56.366 --> 18:58.332
Riley, I know what you're doing.

18:58.334 --> 18:59.851
You're hurt.

18:59.886 --> 19:01.235
You want to be validated.

19:01.287 --> 19:03.871
I was doing the same thing
pretending to be with Zoey.

19:03.873 --> 19:05.139
Who the hell is Zoey?

19:06.359 --> 19:10.044
Damn, Mrs. Wheeler, you
raised a couple of players!

19:15.168 --> 19:17.134
Riley, you gotta let this one go.

19:17.187 --> 19:19.103
It just isn't worth it.

19:19.138 --> 19:21.989
Riley... please!

19:21.991 --> 19:24.141
Just... forget about
the court and the jury.

19:24.177 --> 19:27.094
Talk to me. I love you.

19:27.146 --> 19:29.046
I'm begging you to forgive me.

19:29.082 --> 19:31.916
I promise I will never
disappoint you again.

19:34.170 --> 19:38.039
Danny... I don't need to
hear the jury's decision.

19:38.091 --> 19:39.040
(crying)

19:40.093 --> 19:43.044
Because every time I
look at you now, I just...

19:43.096 --> 19:45.012
I picture you and Sam together.

19:46.132 --> 19:48.099
You lied to me,

19:48.134 --> 19:49.133
and you broke my heart.

19:51.104 --> 19:52.053
Riley.

19:53.139 --> 19:58.059
Oh... honey. It's gonna be okay, okay?

19:58.061 --> 19:59.060
Come here.

20:02.115 --> 20:03.948
This was fun.

20:05.235 --> 20:08.152
I'm gonna bring my
ex-husband in here next week!

20:11.415 --> 20:15.456
So, basically, Zoey's gonna
