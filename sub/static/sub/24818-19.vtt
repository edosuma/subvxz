- I feel like my anxiety's
worse now.

03:10.991 --> 03:14.493
But even back then, you know,
I was so stressed to even come,

03:14.595 --> 03:16.061
because I was telling
the producers, like,

03:16.163 --> 03:18.330
"I think this is gonna happen.
I think this is gonna happen."

03:18.432 --> 03:19.831
And they're like, "No,
it's not gonna happen."

03:19.934 --> 03:22.668
So then I was like,
"I told you guys."

03:22.770 --> 03:24.002
- This was gonna happen?
- Yeah.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.572

we could get all the issues

03:30.744 --> 03:32.211
resolved here one day?

03:32.313 --> 03:34.012
- One day? One day?

I thought you were gonna say
today, and I was like, "Nnn."

03:36.550 --> 03:38.183
- Yeah, today's not
gonna happen, but maybe.

03:38.285 --> 03:39.751
- Eventually.
- I don't think so.

03:39.853 --> 03:40.986
- We use to be close.

And there's even been
disagreements that we could

03:42.856 --> 03:44.022
still sit on this stage.

03:44.124 --> 03:47.125
I think what really blew
it up was the fight--

04:37.711 --> 04:40.445
- Jo filed for child support
against me.

incredible between

show up at my house.

said, "Jason came to my home,

09:05.579 --> 09:08.413
[laughs] I hear ya.
- Okay.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.918
- [applause]

09:13.020 --> 09:15.453
- Well, first up,
how's Addie doing?

09:15.556 --> 09:17.022
- Addie's doing a lot better.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.691
She still has lymph node
that's really swollen,

09:19.793 --> 09:21.259
but they may do a biopsy on it.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.094
We're just kind
of monitoring it.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.729
She's been on
antibiotics for a month.

09:24.831 --> 09:25.897
- Because she
had mono, correct?

09:25.999 --> 09:26.965
- Yeah.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.467
- And Jeremy stepped in?

09:29.570 --> 09:30.936
- He did.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.204
I was happy he came home.
- DR. DREW: Were you impressed?

09:33.307 --> 09:35.040
- I was impressed, yeah.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.141
- And how 'bout Jason?

09:36.243 --> 09:37.309
Did he check in on Addie?

09:37.411 --> 09:39.511
- Uh, Jason and I
were already broke up.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.012
- So, what happened?

09:41.114 --> 09:43.815
I thought things were good
between you and Jason.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.450
- It just wasn't
a great relationship.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.086
Like we didn't--we
weren't great together.

09:48.188 --> 09:51.222
- It seemed like he wasn't
ready to accept that breakup.

09:51.325 --> 09:52.924
- No, he--neither one of 'em.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.993
- In fact, he showed up
at your sister's, right?

09:55.095 --> 09:57.562
- Yeah, he called my mom,
showed at my grandma's,

09:57.664 --> 09:58.763
it was--yeah.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.999
- That's a little--that's
stalking behavior.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.501
- It was kind of--he just like
walked it, it was kinda creepy.

10:03.604 --> 10:07.238
Addie was like, "Uh, why
is he being creepy?"

10:07.341 --> 10:09.007
She locked the door
when he left.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.241
- [laughter]

10:10.344 --> 10:12.210
- Gentlemen, when somebody
breaks up, accept it.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.112
Do not stalk somebody.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.547
Don't stalk on social media.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.650
Don't--let it be, let it be.
It's all good.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.952
It's weird how much young men
do that these days, so.

10:21.054 --> 10:24.823
- What would you say was...I
guess, the breaking point?

10:24.925 --> 10:26.891
There had to have been something
where you're just like, "Yeah,

10:26.994 --> 10:28.226
this isn't gonna work for me."

10:28.328 --> 10:30.629
- He called his ex-wife
on Valentine's Day.

10:30.731 --> 10:31.930
It was really weird.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.999
I didn't even talk to him on
Valentine's Day. It was--

10:34.101 --> 10:36.501
- So, he didn't talk to you,
but he talked to his ex?

10:36.603 --> 10:37.535
- LEAH: Yeah.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.871
And I just told--I
said that--I know.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.773
Like I said,
I let it go on far longer

10:41.875 --> 10:43.975
than it should have went on.

10:44.077 --> 10:47.646
- I just wanted to commend you
for trusting your instincts,

10:47.748 --> 10:52.017
because so many times, us women,
we--we always give chances.

10:52.119 --> 10:55.253
We're always thinking like,
"Well, maybe had I--oh,

10:55.355 --> 10:56.454
I'll just it go."

10:56.556 --> 10:58.823
But you trusted your instinct,
and it's right.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.592
- Yeah.
- [applause]

11:00.694 --> 11:02.627
- Thank you, thank you.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.329
- You know, you were
talking to the girls

11:04.431 --> 11:05.797
about the importance of
education.

11:05.899 --> 11:10.402
and Leah said they do it
so they "Don't be like you."

11:10.504 --> 11:13.571
- [laughs] It was a good one.

11:13.674 --> 11:16.007
It was good one, I want them to
be aware of that, though.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.842
I don't want them
to be 17 and pregnant.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.645
- Last time we were together,
I told you how emotional I got

11:20.747 --> 11:22.747
when Jeremy told you how well
you've been doing,

11:22.849 --> 11:23.915
how proud he was.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.384
That still affects me
to this day.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.719
- LEAH: Thank you.
- That was--

11:27.821 --> 11:30.221
- Round of applause for Leah.
- [applause]

11:30.323 --> 11:31.489

11:31.591 --> 11:32.724
And you know what, Dr. Drew?

11:32.826 --> 11:35.794
She's--you're so confident
right now.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.228
I love seeing this growth.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.863
You've come so far.
- Thank you.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.899
- We'll pause there,
because after the break,

11:41.001 --> 11:43.001
we'll bring Jeremy
on stage to talk about

11:43.103 --> 11:44.536
spending more time with Addie,

11:44.638 --> 11:47.439
and maybe any lingering
feelings for Leah.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.407
Stick around.

he's involved with Leah.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.610
- So, what did you think when
you heard everything Leah said?

12:25.712 --> 12:28.046
'Cause I know you were
watching backstage.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.748
- I don't know,
most of it was right.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.283
- Most of it?
- Yeah.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.219
- NESSA: What
did she get wrong?

12:34.321 --> 12:35.787
- Some of the Jason [bleep].

12:35.889 --> 12:38.790
- DR. DREW: What'd--what'd
she get wrong about that?

12:38.892 --> 12:40.759
- Super controlling dude.

12:40.861 --> 12:44.796
Like, 'cause I'd call Leah,
and ten minutes goes by,

12:44.898 --> 12:47.432
she'll call me back and
it's on speakerphone.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.400
It's almost like she couldn't
answer the phone call unless

12:49.503 --> 12:51.836
Jason could, like, monitor
what was being said.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.605
- I think he thought
something was going on

12:53.707 --> 12:55.340
that he didn't know about
or something.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.941
- And there really
wasn't nothing going on.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.276
- DR. DREW: Right.
- Yeah.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.745
- Is that where you first
started having concerns?

13:00.847 --> 13:03.181
- My concern was, like, after
the fourth time of him not even

13:03.283 --> 13:05.950
wanting to say hi, or like,
"Hey, I'm around your kid,

13:06.052 --> 13:08.820
my name's Jason."
- Right.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.488
- Look, [bleep] happen me
and Leah's relationship,

13:10.590 --> 13:11.790
we got divorced.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.092
If she'd find somebody that's
like great guy--at first,

13:14.194 --> 13:16.995
I kinda like liked
this guy, you know?

13:17.097 --> 13:18.329
So, like, I was happy for her.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.831
It wasn't like
I was a bit jealous.

13:19.933 --> 13:20.865
I was just actually happy.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.600
She has a good
guy, he has a job.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.904
He seems to have his head on his
shoulders, he's around my kid.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.338
What else
could you ask you for?

13:27.440 --> 13:28.540
You know what I mean?

13:28.642 --> 13:30.608
But then he turned into
being a [bleep] stalker.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.877
I didn't like him showing up at
Leah's house where my kid

13:32.979 --> 13:35.246
sleeps, and just out of the
blue, you know what I mean?

13:35.348 --> 13:36.948
Like don't do that.
Like what the [bleep]?

13:37.050 --> 13:38.683
Don't show up where
my kid's sleeping--

13:38.785 --> 13:39.818
- DR. DREW: I get it.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.853
- --and ask her if
she wants a stepdaddy.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.688
- What?
- JEREMY: [bleep].

13:43.790 --> 13:45.390
- He said that?
- He asked her--my daughter--

13:45.492 --> 13:48.059
if she wanted a stepdaddy, yeah.
- Huh?

13:48.161 --> 13:50.128
- He was gonna marry you?
He wanted to marry you?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.096
- This was after they broke up.
- NESSA: Oooh.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.866
- I think it was a way to--
- DR. DREW: Oh my God.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.301
- --it was like
a manipulative thing.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.635
- DR. DREW: Yeah,
oh, my goodness.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.737
- I picked it, yeah.
This wasn't right, guys.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.639
- Jeremy, I wanna talk
a little bit about Addie.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.876
Because before she got
hospitalized, she had mentioned

14:04.978 --> 14:07.712
to Leah that she would like
her parents back together.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.647
- Yeah.
- AUDIENCE: [laughs]

14:09.749 --> 14:12.016

Okay, so--
- AUDIENCE: [laughter]

14:17.991 --> 14:19.858
- Okay, wait, are you single?

14:19.960 --> 14:21.693

- Okay.

14:21.795 --> 14:23.228

- Good choice of words, Leah.
Real good choice of words.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.579
- No, like we went to
the rooftop, which--

14:41.681 --> 14:44.582
- NESSA: Which is nice though,
to be able--to be able to have

14:44.684 --> 14:48.920

and wanna know them intimately.

see them together or what?

the same way, and they--

15:08.408 --> 15:10.408
- And the kids love them.
- Absolutely, so.

15:10.510 --> 15:14.579
- Does Addie know about your
relationship with one another?

15:14.681 --> 15:17.849
Does she fully understand
that there might be a chance?

15:17.951 --> 15:21.552
- I mean, we had a fire
one night with her and...

15:21.655 --> 15:23.254
she picked up on it.
She gets all excited.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.490
- What did she say?
What did she notice?

15:25.592 --> 15:27.759

Mommy? Do you love Daddy?"

15:27.861 --> 15:31.696
[laughs] No, like--yeah.
- Well, what did you say?

15:31.798 --> 15:33.665
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]
- Tell us.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.266

"Of course we do.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.201
"That's your daddy,
and that's your mom.

mom and dad, you know?"

17:45.632 --> 17:47.498
What's your favorite
thing about it?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.033
- Playing on the playground.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.069
- NESSA: Yeah, yeah, me, too.

17:51.171 --> 17:54.205
- I saw you giving some advice
to Jason about what it's like

17:54.307 --> 17:56.107
to be on camera, what he
should, and shouldn't do.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.942
And you told him not to fart.

17:58.044 --> 18:01.012
Is everyone else--has everyone
else been okay that way?

18:01.114 --> 18:03.815
Or does somebody have a problem?

18:03.917 --> 18:05.783
- Sometimes the problem is dad.

18:05.885 --> 18:09.887
- ALL: [laughing]

18:09.989 --> 18:11.956
- Oh, Addie, you are the best.

18:12.058 --> 18:13.991
Okay, so there's
some fans here

18:14.094 --> 18:17.195
that wanna ask you some
questions. Okay?

18:17.297 --> 18:18.696
And then we have
a couple questions

18:18.798 --> 18:20.398
from social media for you.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.934
This is @Starshyne9.

18:23.036 --> 18:24.335
Addie...

18:28.641 --> 18:31.342
- Yeah, yeah, I do.
- NESSA: You do?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.144
- LEAH: I forgot.
- Addie: Yeah.

18:33.246 --> 18:36.047
- NESSA: Why does Dad
not like it so much?

18:36.149 --> 18:38.416
- Because it talks
and it creeps him out.

18:38.518 --> 18:41.285
- [laughs]
- NESSA: Oh, okay, got it.

18:41.387 --> 18:42.787
Okay, so here's
another question.

18:42.889 --> 18:45.890
This is from Emily-Richards...

18:50.296 --> 18:51.963
- Because they love me.

18:52.065 --> 18:53.965
- AUDIENCE: Aww!

18:54.067 --> 18:55.700

18:55.802 --> 18:57.335

audience questions.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.070
Let's get to it, let's bring
somebody down here.

18:59.172 --> 19:02.440
Tell us your name, where you're
from, and ask the question.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.909
- Hi, my name is Shashony,
and I'm from Albany, New York.

19:05.011 --> 19:09.247
My first question is: Do
you enjoy having sisters?

19:09.349 --> 19:10.948
And do you ever wish
you had a brother?

19:11.050 --> 19:13.918
- Yeah. No, I don't like
brothers.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.587
- ALL: [laughing]

19:16.689 --> 19:19.757

19:19.859 --> 19:22.493

I'm from Tampa, Florida.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.630
Addie, what do you wanna
be when you grow up?

19:25.732 --> 19:27.798
- Oh, God.
- LEAH: Here we go.

19:27.901 --> 19:30.434

a great Tinkerbell.

- Anything you wanna say to
your mom and dad before you go?

19:40.847 --> 19:42.480
- I miss y'all, and I love you.

19:42.582 --> 19:43.714

19:47.253 --> 19:49.720

the movie "The Parent Trap"?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.361
- JEREMY: I had to
think what that was.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.798
- I don't know what that is.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.967
- Oh, I just think
you may like it.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.669
I just--I don't know.

20:04.771 --> 20:10.575
Anything you wanna say to the
fans here who watch you on TV?

20:10.677 --> 20:13.811
- Thank you for watching
our "Teen Mom 2."

20:13.913 --> 20:16.914
It's the best people
that ever watch TV.

- Oh, my God.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.918

20:21.020 --> 20:23.054

- Bye!

20:23.156 --> 20:24.222
Bye!

20:24.324 --> 20:25.690
- Thank you to Leah and Jeremy.

20:25.792 --> 20:28.159
And up next,
we'll bring out Kailyn

20:28.261 --> 20:30.962
to discuss her child support
battle with Joe,

20:31.064 --> 20:33.364
and where things stand
with Chris.

20:33.466 --> 20:36.067
- [applause]

20:36.169 --> 20:38.135

he cheated on me with was

20:38.238 --> 20:40.404
sitting next to me the whole
time, and I had no idea,

20:40.506 --> 20:43.040
and she did, and he did, and I
sat there and didn't find out

20:43.142 --> 20:44.175
until the end.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.210
- Do you wanna have
kids with Briana?

20:46.312 --> 20:48.179
- [groans]
- NESSA: Oh, Briana, stop.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.880

you wanna know

Nessa and I are
here with Kailyn.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.365
- [cheering and applause]

21:07.467 --> 21:10.434
- I'm not sure that anyone
had more to deal with

21:10.536 --> 21:11.736
this season than Kailyn.

21:11.838 --> 21:14.338
She's raising three sons
with three different fathers,

21:14.440 --> 21:16.540
she found herself
in a child support battle,

21:16.643 --> 21:19.110
she launched
a CBD haircare line,

21:19.212 --> 21:21.379
she reconnected with
her estranged sister,

21:21.481 --> 21:23.314
and she's navigating

21:23.416 --> 21:26.183
an on-and-off-again relationship
with Chris.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.019
Take a look at all
of that and more.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.921
- ♪

21:31.024 --> 21:33.257
- You're going to third grade.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.793
What's a goal that you
have for this year?

21:35.895 --> 21:37.128
- Mm.

21:37.230 --> 21:38.963
To accomplish everything.

21:40.033 --> 21:42.366
Javi's having another baby.
Lauren's pregnant.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.035
I have a sister.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.736
Do you know how
weird that is to say?

21:45.838 --> 21:47.638
- I got some big news
to tell you.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.341
- What? You're pregnant?
- Yeah.

21:50.443 --> 21:54.345
- Chris said--oh wow--
"I love you, Miss Lawry."

21:57.383 --> 21:59.417
So this is my life.

21:59.519 --> 22:03.487
- I was like, "She's on live,
let me put my mom on live.

22:03.589 --> 22:04.822
[bleep].

22:07.827 --> 22:09.994
- Oh my God.
- BARBARA: [laughs]

22:10.096 --> 22:13.130
- Joe got 50/50 in January,
and he filed for child support.

22:13.232 --> 22:14.198
I don't know where.

22:14.300 --> 22:15.299
- How did it go?

22:15.401 --> 22:17.768
- He really--she
really was neutral.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.037
So I was like, "I'll pay you
the money I--that you were

22:20.139 --> 22:21.439
"paying in child
support for the year.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.174
What else could
you possibly need?"

22:23.276 --> 22:24.975
And he's like, "I
might still need help."

22:26.813 --> 22:29.313
- [applause]

22:29.415 --> 22:31.449
- Kail, you went through
a lot this season.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.484
How you feeling after
seeing all of that?

22:33.586 --> 22:34.852
- I feel good.

22:34.954 --> 22:37.855
I feel like, overall, it was
a more positive season

22:37.957 --> 22:39.323
than seasons in the past.

22:39.425 --> 22:42.960
- So I wanna talk a little bit
about your relationship status.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.696
What is the relationship
with Chris right now?

22:45.798 --> 22:46.997
- We don't talk.

22:47.100 --> 22:49.533
It's been eight weeks-ish.

22:49.635 --> 22:50.935
- Eight weeks?

22:51.037 --> 22:53.904
- Things were good after the
launch party, they were fine.

22:54.006 --> 22:58.376
And then, you know,
just didn't work out.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.745
And was it more of
his call or your--

23:00.847 --> 23:02.747
- No, this--I left.
- Oh.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.648
- I threw a baby shower
for his best friend.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.751
We found out that one of
the girls that he cheated

23:06.853 --> 23:08.819
on me with was sitting
next to me the whole time,

23:08.921 --> 23:11.655
and I had no idea, and she did,
and he did, and I sat there

23:11.758 --> 23:12.990
and didn't
find out until the end.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.425
So, I was humiliated.

23:15.661 --> 23:16.961
- I wasn't expecting that.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.162
Did anyone?

23:18.264 --> 23:20.264
I was like, "Yo, what?"
- DR. DREW: Okay, got it.

23:20.366 --> 23:23.267
- The sad part is that I tried
to keep him out of my storyline

23:23.369 --> 23:26.470
for so long, but he was
affecting--like our relationship

23:26.572 --> 23:28.472
was affecting all
aspects of my life,

23:28.574 --> 23:31.609
that it boiled over
into "Teen Mom."

23:31.711 --> 23:33.177
- And let's talk
about your sister.

23:33.279 --> 23:34.845
How was that
reconnecting with Makaila?

23:34.947 --> 23:36.213
- It was good.

23:36.315 --> 23:38.482
I mean, we always talk, like,
catch up from time to time.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.919
But it is hard because we
grew up not knowing each other.

23:42.021 --> 23:46.357
And so, it's kinda like, how do
you maintain a relationship now

23:46.459 --> 23:49.293
that we didn't have our whole
lives together, you know?

23:49.395 --> 23:50.828
- Isn't that kind
of an opportunity?

23:50.930 --> 23:53.464
- It is, but we live
in two different states.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.733
And she has her own life,
and I have my own life.

23:55.835 --> 23:58.269
And so it's hard to like
prioritize each other.

23:58.371 --> 24:00.004
- And Mikaila's giving
you advice, right?

24:00.106 --> 24:01.338
- Yeah, and
she's good at it.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.274
- And she said you
shouldn't be dating anymore?

24:03.376 --> 24:04.642
- [laughs] Yeah.

24:04.744 --> 24:05.910
She's--yeah.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.077
- Good advice? Bad advice?

24:07.180 --> 24:08.145
- Probably good advice.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.547
- Probably good advice. [laughs]

24:09.649 --> 24:11.582
- You know, I have
a question for you.

24:11.684 --> 24:14.552
How did you feel when you saw
Jenelle burning the products

24:14.654 --> 24:15.953
you sent her,
that you gifted her?

24:16.055 --> 24:18.222
- I literally--there's
a scene of me saying,

24:18.324 --> 24:20.224
"She's probably gonna use
it for target practice,"

24:20.326 --> 24:21.926
so it didn't hurt
my feelings at all.

24:22.028 --> 24:23.894
- If you knew
that, why send it?

24:23.996 --> 24:24.962
- That's what--

24:25.064 --> 24:26.363
- Um, because
I really--I don't have

24:26.466 --> 24:27.665
a problem with Jenelle, herself.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.568
Like we have gone
through so much crap.

24:30.670 --> 24:33.437
But like I could--I could
sit on the couch with her.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.473
I wanted to send it to her.
Like, why not?

24:35.575 --> 24:37.708
It wasn't gonna hurt me
to send her a product.

24:37.810 --> 24:41.011
- Right. How did you feel when
you heard what Barb said?

24:42.081 --> 24:44.415
- I was annoyed,
because I felt like...

24:46.152 --> 24:47.551
I think she's like in her 60s.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.321
Like how that was allowed, and
nothing was done about it.

24:50.423 --> 24:51.522
- Mm.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.657
- You just said you would
sit here with Jenelle.

24:53.759 --> 24:55.092
- Yeah.
- How 'bout Leah?

24:55.194 --> 24:56.460
- Yeah.
- How 'bout Briana?

24:56.562 --> 24:58.162
- No.
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]

24:58.264 --> 25:01.832
- So, is that why you're not
willing to be with any of them?

25:01.934 --> 25:04.735
- I just don't wanna
associate--I'm ashamed of how

25:04.837 --> 25:07.838
I acted during last reunion, and
I take full accountability

25:07.940 --> 25:09.640
for what I did
and my part in that.

25:09.742 --> 25:11.609
But I don't wanna associate
myself with people like that.

25:11.711 --> 25:14.411
- What was the biggest concern?
- Safety.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.480
I agreed to this
five o'clock yesterday.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.362
It's like that.

26:38.464 --> 26:39.697
I'm gonna miss you.

26:39.799 --> 26:40.798
I don't wanna leave.

26:40.900 --> 26:41.899
- You don't have to.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.934
- I do have to.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.670
It's like the infection is in
her joint and her shoulder.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.606
Luis hasn't really
said anything.

26:48.708 --> 26:51.742
I told him that
she needed surgery.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.178
He's just like, "Let me
know how she's doing."

26:54.280 --> 26:56.113
Is that your daddy?
- Hi.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.514
- [crying]

26:57.617 --> 26:59.016
- Mommy's here, Mommy's here.

26:59.118 --> 27:02.019
She just has to gain...that
relationship with you,

27:02.121 --> 27:03.988
get to know who you
are, learn about you.

27:04.090 --> 27:04.922
- Yeah, I know.

27:05.024 --> 27:07.124
- She wants more time with you.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.159
She wants you to
come around more.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.695
- I would definitely assume
she's not happy with

27:11.797 --> 27:13.631
how things are,
'cause I'm not.

27:13.733 --> 27:17.635
- Nova decided she wanted to
sleep over Devoin's house.

27:17.737 --> 27:18.769
- Set.

27:18.871 --> 27:19.837
Go!

27:19.939 --> 27:21.805
- [giggling]

27:21.907 --> 27:24.708
- Devoin is a little bit
more active in Nova's life,

27:24.810 --> 27:26.210
so that's a good thing.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.745
He does more than Luis.

27:30.016 --> 27:30.914
- NOVA: I can't!

27:31.017 --> 27:34.385
- ALL: [laughing]

27:34.487 --> 27:35.386
- [camera clicks]

27:35.488 --> 27:39.657

27:39.759 --> 27:42.393
- Briana, so good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.161
- You know, I have
a question for you.

27:44.263 --> 27:48.732
Are you able to have a clear,
civil conversation with Kail?

27:48.834 --> 27:50.267
This is why I'm asking--
- Oh yeah!

27:50.369 --> 27:53.570
I was willing--I was willing to
sit next to her on a couch

27:53.673 --> 27:55.906
this reunion, but they said no.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.842
- I hope that we get to see you
all together on stage one day

27:58.944 --> 27:59.977
where we can actually

28:00.079 --> 28:01.979
have a conversation.
- I'm sure, I'm sure.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.181
Maybe next season, if there
will be a next season.

28:05.751 --> 28:08.018
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]

28:08.120 --> 28:09.553
- We've got Devoin.

28:09.655 --> 28:10.954
Well, he's improving, right?

28:11.057 --> 28:13.157
All the sudden--uh-oh--he gets
great,

28:13.259 --> 28:15.225
and then he goes down, right?
- Yes, thank you.

28:15.327 --> 28:16.427
Oh, my God.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.262
- I'm still
a Devoin fan, by the way.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.463
- No, don't. You can't be.

28:19.565 --> 28:20.764
Not after what happened.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.666
Not after what happened.
- I don't know what happened.

28:22.768 --> 28:27.137
- Um...I don't know, there
was an incident that happened.

28:27.239 --> 28:30.607
I don't think you guys will see
it this season, maybe next.

28:30.710 --> 28:33.043
Nova was there, and
the cameras were there.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.478
- Can you tell
us what happened?

28:34.580 --> 28:38.015
- Mm, so, Nova slept
over Devoin's house.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.117
Then Devoin took Nova
to the pool

28:40.219 --> 28:42.286
with her friends to hang out.

28:42.388 --> 28:45.823
And Devoin got
extremely intoxicated.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.391
- While watching the kids?

28:47.493 --> 28:49.460
- While watching the kids
in a pool setting.

28:49.562 --> 28:52.930
He was...very, very drunk,
to the point where he didn't

28:53.032 --> 28:54.331
remember anything that happened.

28:54.433 --> 28:55.399
- Whoa.
- Wow.

28:55.501 --> 28:56.734
- BRIANA: Yes. So, now,

28:56.836 --> 28:59.603
I haven't spoken to him
or seen him since it happened.

28:59.705 --> 29:02.873
- Well, let's check out
a sneak peek that's gonna

29:02.975 --> 29:06.477
give you some insight into what
she's been talking about here,

29:06.579 --> 29:08.779
and what you will
see on next season.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.016

29:16.622 --> 29:18.222
- [bleep] tired.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.296
- NOVA: Night.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.899
- Your drink is
spilling all over my car.

29:29.001 --> 29:30.768
I'm just saying, it's spilling.

29:30.870 --> 29:33.370
- DEVOIN: Her and her friends
is definitely very tiring,

29:33.472 --> 29:34.905
oh, my God.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.106
- Are you okay?

29:36.208 --> 29:37.574
- She's great, she had

29:37.676 --> 29:40.277
the best time in her life.
- BRIANA: You sure?

29:40.379 --> 29:41.512
- [camera clicks]

29:43.449 --> 29:45.449
- Ooof.
- NESSA: Yeah.

29:45.551 --> 29:48.252
- Yeah, so like you said,
Devoin has his great moments,

29:48.354 --> 29:50.721
and then he just
plumps back down.

29:50.823 --> 29:52.790
- You know, I don't know
if he has a substance--

29:52.892 --> 29:54.291
- I don't know either.
- --diagnosable condition

29:54.393 --> 29:57.027
or not, but a lot
of the trouble he's had--

29:57.129 --> 29:58.228
I mean, think about it,

29:58.330 --> 30:00.731
his jobs, his license,
his prison--jail stuff,

30:00.833 --> 30:02.633
the child,
all around substances.

30:02.735 --> 30:04.535
- Yeah, but there's a time
and place for everything.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.336
You can't do that there.
- I understand.

30:06.438 --> 30:09.072
That's what suggests
that the substances rule.

30:09.175 --> 30:10.374
- Yeah.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.075
- There might be a way
to help him--

30:12.178 --> 30:14.511
- Right. I tried, so--
- I hope--I hope there is a way.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.413
- I hope so, too,
because I'm a Devoin fan.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.182
- And just seeing--
- Everybody's a Devoin fan.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.818
I'm not. I'm done.

30:20.920 --> 30:21.852
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]

30:21.954 --> 30:23.187
- In part three
of this reunion,

30:23.289 --> 30:25.455
we will talk with
Briana and Devoin,

30:25.558 --> 30:27.758
and see what he has
to say about this.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.561
- Okay, so I wanna
talk about your boo.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.329
- Oh, John.
- NESSA: John.

30:32.431 --> 30:35.465
So, how long have you
two been together?

30:35.568 --> 30:37.367
- We're gonna make
it a year in May.

30:37.469 --> 30:38.702
- NESSA: [gasps]
- DR. DREW: Wow.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.737
- Who said "I love you" first?

30:40.840 --> 30:42.439
- Oh, I don't know.
- NESSA: Oh!

30:42.541 --> 30:45.475
- I don't know, you can ask him.
- Okay, we will. I can't wait.

30:45.578 --> 30:48.545
- Well, let's have
John join us for a bit.

30:48.647 --> 30:49.780
Please welcome John.

30:49.882 --> 30:55.552
- [applause]

30:56.422 --> 30:57.421
- Hello, John.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.856
- Hey, John. Nice to meet you.

30:58.958 --> 31:03.393
Is it a whole lot to walk into
this, and the cameras, the life?

31:03.495 --> 31:06.096
- I wanna say not really,
'cause nothing really changes.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.798
But it's--I mean, it's
different, obviously,

31:07.900 --> 31:09.900
but it's like
a whole "Wow" factor.

31:10.002 --> 31:11.335
At least not yet, not to me.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.437
- Stella seemed to
bond to you immediately.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.405
Hmm? Do you have
experience with kids?

31:15.507 --> 31:17.708
- Yes. I love kids.
- DR. DREW: You do?

31:17.810 --> 31:19.109
- I think of myself growing up.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.578
I had a lot of love
as I was growing up.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.547
And I think it did me well, so--

31:23.649 --> 31:25.182
- She has a very close
co-parenting relationship

31:25.284 --> 31:26.416
with Devoin.
- JOHN: Yes.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.685
- You cool with that?
- No, I don't have a problem.

31:28.787 --> 31:30.053
That was another part
of the conversation,

31:30.155 --> 31:31.989
as long as
I don't have to deal with,

31:32.091 --> 31:34.658
you know, baby father
drama and unnecessary stuff,

31:34.760 --> 31:36.827
like we can always talk as men.

31:36.929 --> 31:39.563
- You and Devoin. How 'bout
what's going on with Luis?

31:41.033 --> 31:42.432
- Same. I don't know the man.

31:42.534 --> 31:43.901
I don't know any of them.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.236
I don't know their backstory,
don't know where they came from,

31:46.338 --> 31:47.704
why--why they're--where
they're at now, so--

31:47.806 --> 31:50.173
- I really appreciate you're not
passing judgement on him.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.909
But what he's doing
is not cool, right?

31:52.011 --> 31:52.943
- It's not.

31:53.045 --> 31:54.912
- Do you wanna have kids?
- Of course.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.546
- With Briana?
- Of course.

31:56.649 --> 31:57.848
- You know, I'm a girl,

31:57.950 --> 32:00.684
I just enjoy--I'm enjoying
this moment right now.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.519
- [groans]
- NESSA: Oh, Briana, stop.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.288
I'm asking a lot of questions
you wanna know

32:04.390 --> 32:05.522
down deep inside you.

32:05.624 --> 32:09.126
- [laughing]

32:09.228 --> 32:10.827
- NESSA: John, talk
to me a little bit.

32:10.930 --> 32:12.029
Have you thought about marriage?

32:12.131 --> 32:14.231
You know, like, she's not
in a rush to get married,

32:14.333 --> 32:15.999
but you would like to
get married one day.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.402
- Of course, but the fact that
we're still in long distance,

32:18.504 --> 32:21.038
it's--everything is steps.
- NESSA: Right.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.572
- And we understood that, so.

32:22.675 --> 32:24.374
- This is nice to
see her this happy.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.843
I don't think I've ever
seen Briana this happy.

32:26.946 --> 32:28.078
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.813
- I like this
chemistry right now--

32:29.915 --> 32:31.581
- He's great. I love him.

32:31.684 --> 32:32.649
- Ooh.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.251
- He treats you good?
- Yes.

32:34.353 --> 32:37.487
- Does he take you out on dates?
- Yes, he's great.

32:37.589 --> 32:41.224
- John, how 'bout Briana?
- He calls me stubborn.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.360
He says I stress him out.
- AUDIENCE: [laughing]

32:43.462 --> 32:45.996
- He calls me crazy.
- JOHN: Yeah.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.098
- Do you disagree with anything
that--

32:48.200 --> 32:49.333
- Mm-hmm.

32:49.435 --> 32:50.834
- NESSA: Okay,
it's on a good path.

32:50.936 --> 32:52.436
- I don't think
I stress you out.

32:52.538 --> 32:53.770
I don't think so.
- At times.

32:53.872 --> 32:56.640
- How? Name a time.

32:56.742 --> 32:59.209
- I don't write them down,
I just--

32:59.311 --> 33:00.677
- Briana, sometimes
you stress me out,

33:00.779 --> 33:02.379
and I'm not in a relationship
with you.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.282
So, I can imagine John's gotta
contain some stuff.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.150
Again, John, really appreciate
you being out here.

33:07.252 --> 33:08.452
Thank you.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.520
In part three of this reunion,
we will talk with Briana

33:10.622 --> 33:14.391
and Devoin, and also hear
from Brittany and Roxanne.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.393
There's more "Teen Mom 2"

this season due to MTV

33:39.651 --> 33:41.385
not filming
with her husband, David.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.820
What we did see was a lot of
fighting over custody

33:43.922 --> 33:46.356
for Kaiser, fighting with
Kailyn,

33:46.458 --> 33:49.192
even with Amber
from "Teen Mom OG" after Amber

33:49.294 --> 33:53.497
chose to go live on social media
rather than speaking directly

33:53.599 --> 33:57.534
to Jenelle
with her concerns and beef.

Mommy and I are getting
along now, right?

34:06.945 --> 34:07.811
- Yeah.

34:07.913 --> 34:09.880
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Yes.

34:09.982 --> 34:12.249
- What was it that brought
you and Jenelle back together?

34:12.351 --> 34:17.888
- That big episode with Nathan
taking Kaiser.

34:17.990 --> 34:20.791
I guess she needed her
mother at that point.

34:20.893 --> 34:23.860
And then ever since then,
we've been, like, talking.

34:23.962 --> 34:27.931
- I look at my son's butt, and
there's switch marks all across.

34:28.033 --> 34:30.400
I said, "Kaiser, what
happened to your butt?"

34:30.502 --> 34:32.769
He said, "David, he--he
hit me with a stick."

34:32.871 --> 34:35.539
To tell you the truth, I don't
want David anywhere around him.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.841
I don't feel safe with
my son around him.

34:37.943 --> 34:41.645
- It just pisses me off the way
everyone thinks about David,

34:41.747 --> 34:43.280
'cause he doesn't
do anything wrong.

34:43.382 --> 34:46.083
And he does everything in his
power to make our family happy.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.118
- I filed my own
custody motion.

34:48.220 --> 34:49.886
I want full custody.

to me, you know,

35:07.706 --> 35:11.975
I'll just accept what she tells
me until she's ready to tell me

35:12.077 --> 35:13.910
what the truth.

35:14.012 --> 35:16.279
- It was like a big
drunk misunderstanding.

35:16.381 --> 35:20.450
- Oh, I think Jenelle
just showed up with David.

35:20.552 --> 35:22.085

gotta shut down.

35:22.187 --> 35:23.687
- She doesn't
wanna film anymore,

35:23.789 --> 35:27.691
because every time she
makes a commitment to film,

35:27.793 --> 35:30.260
David, like, starts
a fight with her.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.462
I said, "He's not even working."

35:32.564 --> 35:35.232
And I said, "What are you gonna
do if you lose the show?"

35:35.334 --> 35:38.568
I said, "You're gonna lose
everything you have."

35:39.905 --> 35:43.874
- I feel like everyone here is
like filming about David, David,

35:43.976 --> 35:46.510
David, David, David, David.

35:46.612 --> 35:49.179
And David doesn't getta say
nothing about anything.

35:49.281 --> 35:51.648
I told MTV, you know,
I can't keep doing this.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.150
I can't keep going out of town.

35:58.123 --> 36:00.090
- I think Jenelle's
drama's is getting worse

36:00.192 --> 36:01.958
because of who she's with.

36:02.060 --> 36:05.562
- JENELLE: If any "Teen Mom"
couple goes and travels,

36:05.664 --> 36:07.464
they bring whoever
they're married to.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.699
Like, and I don't
have that option.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.134
And it's causing an issue.

36:11.236 --> 36:12.903
- If they come back
and say then, "Okay,

36:13.005 --> 36:16.072
"we--we're not gonna be able to
continue filming with Jenelle

36:16.175 --> 36:17.741
for 'Teen Mom 2'"?

36:17.843 --> 36:19.976
- JENELLE: Right now,
I need to stay home,

36:20.078 --> 36:22.279
because it's important
for my marriage.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.147
And that's what's important to
me right now--

36:24.249 --> 36:25.615
my marriage and my family.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.617
- We're live from Atlanta.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.654
- Let me put my mom on live.
[bleep].

36:33.792 --> 36:34.958
- Ooh.

36:35.060 --> 36:37.794
- I don't understand
why she's so pissed off.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.130
"They should throw
Barbara off the show."

36:40.232 --> 36:43.900
- Nothing crazier has happened
then what comes out of Jenelle

36:44.002 --> 36:45.235
and David and Barbara.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.270
- So, when is she gonna
get fired like Farrah?

36:47.372 --> 36:50.173
- JENELLE: Amber was
talking [bleep] about David.

36:50.275 --> 36:52.209
- You need to get [bleep]
out of that relationship.

36:52.311 --> 36:57.647
- Amber, you didn't like
message me privately about this.

36:57.749 --> 37:00.684
You didn't ask
about your concerns.

37:00.786 --> 37:03.620
You had to go and just
talk [bleep] my husband?

37:03.722 --> 37:05.889
Shut the [bleep]
up about my family.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.224
Leave them alone.

37:07.326 --> 37:08.491
- [camera clicks]

37:08.594 --> 37:13.363
- [applause]

37:13.465 --> 37:15.865
- So, Jenelle, I wanted to talk
to you about that clip really

37:15.968 --> 37:19.636
quick, because you were very
upset that Amber addressed

37:19.738 --> 37:22.906
her concerns about you on social
media instead of contacting

37:23.008 --> 37:24.608
you privately, correct?
- Right.

37:24.710 --> 37:26.109
- And it was hurtful
to you, right?

37:26.211 --> 37:27.544
- Yes.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.846
- Because she was attacking in
what you felt like your family,

37:29.948 --> 37:31.848
you, and--and she knows you.

37:31.950 --> 37:34.784
- Yeah, well, first--before
she went on live,

37:34.886 --> 37:37.254
she was approached
by "Radar Online."

37:37.356 --> 37:39.322
They said, "How do you feel
about Jenelle being with David?"

37:39.424 --> 37:40.924
She's like, "I feel like she
should be

37:41.026 --> 37:43.393
out of the abusive relationship
that she's in."

37:43.495 --> 37:45.095
And I'm like,
"The last time we spoke,

37:45.197 --> 37:47.864
"we went to dinner together
with David and Matt.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.032
"We all got along.

37:49.134 --> 37:50.567
That's the last
time we talked to you,"

37:50.669 --> 37:52.969
so it just really
came out of nowhere.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.337
- I think that's
really interesting,

37:54.439 --> 37:58.708
because...you did
exactly that to me.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.210
- I did? When?
- Yes, you did.

38:00.312 --> 38:05.315
You posted hateful comments on
social media about my family,

38:05.417 --> 38:07.984
about my man, Colin Kaepernick.
You knew that--

38:08.086 --> 38:09.919
- I posted that?
- Yes, you did. And I--

38:10.022 --> 38:11.821
- When did I post it?
- You posted it,

38:11.923 --> 38:13.123
we can pull up the messages.

38:13.225 --> 38:15.091
But listen--just listen to
this before we pull it up,

38:15.193 --> 38:16.793
because I want you to
just hear the full--

38:16.895 --> 38:18.862
- No, I still have no idea what
you're talking about.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.664
- Okay, these were the
comments that were said.

38:22.167 --> 38:23.733
- JENELLE: I've
never seen that.

38:24.870 --> 38:28.438
I honestly have no idea who
your--who your boyfriend is

38:28.540 --> 38:30.140
or husband.
- NESSA: No, he's been on set.

38:30.242 --> 38:32.642
But, hold on--give me a second,
right, and I promise--

38:32.744 --> 38:34.411
- JENELLE: I know, well,
I'm just saying, I--

38:34.513 --> 38:36.513
- Jenelle, this is an open,
healthy conversation that I

38:36.615 --> 38:38.682
would like to have with you.
- Mm-hmm.

38:38.784 --> 38:41.117
- Please understand something.
My man used his platform

38:41.219 --> 38:43.119
to peacefully protest
systemic oppression

38:43.221 --> 38:45.722
in this country,
specifically police brutality

38:45.824 --> 38:47.157
against black people.

38:47.259 --> 38:50.360
Men, women, and children are
dying--wrongfully dying.

38:50.462 --> 38:53.797
And people who are doing this
are not being held accountable.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.231
That is the issue.

38:55.334 --> 38:59.336
It has nothing to do with
military men, military women.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.971
Okay? Because they fought for
our constitution

39:02.074 --> 39:04.708
to peacefully protest--
all of us.

39:04.810 --> 39:08.278
I would have appreciated
if you had contacted me.

39:08.380 --> 39:11.648
I would have been more
than happy, Jenelle, to have

39:11.750 --> 39:14.050
a healthy conversation,
privately, right?

39:14.152 --> 39:17.220
- I don't know anything about
your husband. I swear to God.

39:17.322 --> 39:18.688
- So, wait, no, Jenelle.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.724
- I'm done--I'm done
with this [bleep].

39:20.826 --> 39:23.026
This is exactly why I
didn't [bleep] come here.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.761
- Jenelle, why--
- This is why, like--

39:24.863 --> 39:26.296
- --why can't you
have an open conversation--

39:26.398 --> 39:29.632
- No, this is about our--this
is about my storyline.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.601
And you wanna
bring up your issues.

39:31.703 --> 39:35.171
You wanna bring up "Teen Mom" to
bring up your issues.

39:35.273 --> 39:37.073
- NESSA: It's because you
accused Amber of doing something

39:37.175 --> 39:38.975
that you did to me.
- You got your show.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.745
- No, you did something
that was very hypocritical.

39:41.847 --> 39:44.247
And instead of having
a healthy dialogue right now--

39:44.349 --> 39:46.149
- I have too much
[bleep] going on right now

39:46.251 --> 39:48.852
