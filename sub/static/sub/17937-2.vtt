01:44.600 --> 01:48.040
You made it, then?
Should have sent a man for you.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.000
I didn't need a man, I had Clint.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.040
I heard that.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.560
All right, Don, clear to go in?
Yeah. Help yourself.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.520
Shall we?

01:57.520 --> 02:01.320
Er, no thanks. It's just, the adult
ones are bad enough.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.880
Yeah, all right.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.160
See you later.

02:06.640 --> 02:09.520
Over there.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.480
Thanks.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.680
So small.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.400
Wrapped in 1970s newspaper.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.960
Elderly couple lived here way
back in the '60's,

02:29.960 --> 02:31.520
but it's been empty since.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.600
And way off the beaten track.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.880
Condemned - due to coastal erosion.

02:37.880 --> 02:41.720
A couple more years and the
sea would probably have it.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.320
Bury the evidence forever.

02:45.680 --> 02:47.720
Well, it looks newborn,
or near enough.

02:47.720 --> 02:51.960
And if the birth happened way out
here in the middle of nowhere,

02:51.960 --> 02:55.440
then the mum would have been
pretty frightened...

02:55.440 --> 02:57.320
confused.

02:57.320 --> 03:00.960
Managed to hide the body, though,
didn't she?

03:00.960 --> 03:03.320
That kind of suggests foul play.

03:03.320 --> 03:06.080
Well, not necessarily.
We don't know the circumstances.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.200
Childbirth can be pretty traumatic.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.880
You know women don't have
an easy ride.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.720
Yeah, neither do men,
having to put up with them. Ha!

03:18.480 --> 03:21.280
Must have been pretty nice here,
once upon a time.

03:21.280 --> 03:26.400
Poor little thing,
abandoned in such a lonely place.

03:28.680 --> 03:32.120
Yeah.
What sort of person does that, eh?

03:50.920 --> 03:53.280
WHIRRING OF PROPELLERS

03:56.400 --> 04:00.280
TV: Remains of the baby were found
early this morning,

04:00.280 --> 04:03.680
hidden in a condemned cottage
at Bluff Point.

04:03.680 --> 04:07.400
Demolition workers onsite said
that the remains had been sealed

04:07.400 --> 04:10.440
up in a small nook in
a chimney breast.

04:10.440 --> 04:15.280
Police are yet to identify, but a
forensic investigation is underway.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.880
Detective Sergeant Higgins
said that the...

04:20.240 --> 04:22.440
It's not much to go on.

04:22.440 --> 04:26.680
Sex is undetermined, maybe a month
premature, but perfectly formed.

04:26.680 --> 04:29.280
Apart from the broken ribs.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.040
Well, there's no way to tell whether
that happened post mortem.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.040
Or prior to death.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.920
You know, the longer I do this job,

04:35.920 --> 04:39.880
the more I realise some people just
shouldn't be allowed to have kids.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.720
Well, at least we got a date.

04:44.800 --> 04:48.880
Yeah, 1976. Decades back,
so DNA's doubtful.

04:48.880 --> 04:52.640
Well, a full nuclear they said,
but we might get something from

04:52.640 --> 04:54.600
the bone marrow,
and the baby had hair.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.680
Actually, Clint, can you get the lab
to put a rush on that, please?

04:57.680 --> 05:00.680
Yeah, on it. Thanks.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.400
So there's a chance we'll get
mitochondrial DNA to check

05:03.400 --> 05:04.680
against potential mothers.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.840
Good.
Cos it's the mother we're after.

CHILDREN SHOUT

05:11.600 --> 05:13.880
CAR RADIO: ..it may have been
there for up to 40 years...

05:13.880 --> 05:15.920
We won't be going at all
at this rate!

05:15.920 --> 05:18.440
..hidden in a cottage which
has been derelict since the 1960s.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.800
Shush! Shush! Shush!

05:20.800 --> 05:23.320
..Police say that although
the condition of the baby's

05:23.320 --> 05:26.320
remains makes determining cause
of death difficult, they have

05:26.320 --> 05:28.960
reason to suspect foul play.
Talking to reporters...

05:28.960 --> 05:33.680
Detective Sgt Higgins said
the police are appealing for
information.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.840
The national information
line number is...

05:36.840 --> 05:38.640
TURNS RADIO OFF

05:55.960 --> 05:58.400
I just don't see why it's always
the woman's fault.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.840
Yeah, me neither.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.240
In your case, because you got
caught. You've missed a bit.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.880
Grounded again? Yes. Yep.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.640
Still rolling in at all hours,

06:06.640 --> 06:09.800
so I have had to leave her in
the care of a responsible adult.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.440
I'm not saying it's
definitely the mother.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.920
Just, if that baby was newborn
then she must have been part of

06:15.920 --> 06:17.520
what happened.

06:17.520 --> 06:20.960
Yeah. Or maybe the father or
someone else. Yeah, no-one reported
it missing, did they?

06:20.960 --> 06:23.360
What mother's not going do that,
unless she did it?

06:23.360 --> 06:26.040
Lonely old place, that cottage.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.640
HE SNIFFS

06:27.640 --> 06:29.040
Touch of the man-flu?

06:29.040 --> 06:30.840
Touch of the Ebola, more like.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.040
As generously shared by your mother
last week - along with her

06:34.040 --> 06:35.720
delectables.

06:35.720 --> 06:38.480
You know it, then, Mick?
Bluff Point?

06:38.480 --> 06:40.640
Yeah. My old man used to do jobs up

06:40.640 --> 06:43.400
there back in the '60s when I was
a nipper.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.200
Nice old couple,
but miles from anywhere.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.240
Apart from that great big old
house up on the hill.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.480
Who was living there then?

06:51.480 --> 06:53.200
Uh, yeah...

06:53.200 --> 06:56.760
Grey... something, Greyvale?
Ron Tate's old place.

06:56.760 --> 07:00.240
Shut down late '70s?

07:00.240 --> 07:02.080
Children's home.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.760
Right. I might see if I can turn up
some contact details,

07:05.760 --> 07:07.840
see if there's anyone still around.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.320
I might take a spin past.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.960
Where's my super-strength
Day Nurse? Cancel my chips, Mum.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.200
BLOWS NOSE LOUDLY

07:21.160 --> 07:23.920
Hi, Clint,
did you get hold of the lab?

07:26.080 --> 07:28.840
And any progress on
the Grosvenor court date?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.760
Listen, see if you can find any
council records on

07:32.760 --> 07:35.360
a Greyvale Children's Home,
will you?

07:35.360 --> 07:37.360
Yep, that's it. Active in the '70s.

07:38.640 --> 07:42.240
Just anything you can turn up,
really.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.120
DOG BARKS

07:46.600 --> 07:49.000
What're you after?

07:49.000 --> 07:52.560
RADIO: ..police are appealing for
any information from locals...

07:52.560 --> 07:54.640
I know...

07:54.640 --> 07:58.320
I know I just have to find
the right time.

07:58.320 --> 08:01.320
'..the remains have yet to be
identified but speculation is...'

08:01.320 --> 08:03.560
OK. OK.

08:03.560 --> 08:07.000
'..any information should be
directed to the police either

08:07.000 --> 08:09.200
'locally or on the national crime
number...'

08:09.200 --> 08:11.200
They know.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.520
Pull!

08:15.800 --> 08:18.800
Seems to be working fine!

08:20.040 --> 08:22.800
Perhaps a touch of
performance anxiety?

08:25.920 --> 08:28.680
Quite a place you've got.

08:28.680 --> 08:32.840
Yes, of course it's open
to the masses these days,

08:32.840 --> 08:35.960
traipsing through the Great Hall.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.559
But it pays the bills!

08:38.559 --> 08:41.559
So, Greyvale? You were listed on
an old police database as...

08:41.559 --> 08:44.120
Yes, a Trustee. Yes.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.960
Pull!
GUNSHOTS

08:45.960 --> 08:49.400
Always getting myself
"volunteered" for worthy causes.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.760
Price of being a straight shooter,
I suppose.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.680
So what can you tell
me about the place?

08:54.680 --> 08:57.560
Gosh, now we're going back.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.920
Well, it seemed well-run,
insofar as I could tell. Ron...

09:06.920 --> 09:09.920
Ron Tate, the manager.

09:09.920 --> 09:15.280
He seemed to
like a free hand, as I recall.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.560
And what about the kids?

09:17.560 --> 09:21.160
Any troubled girls in particular,
getting themselves into bother?

09:21.160 --> 09:25.680
Well, of course they were all
vulnerable by definition, but...

09:25.680 --> 09:27.720
GUNSHOTS CONTINUE

09:27.720 --> 09:30.000
..I can't remember any names.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.440
It's been so long ago.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.760
All lost in the mists of time.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.120
Pull!
GUNSHOTS

09:39.120 --> 09:44.320
No! No, no! Go back.

09:46.320 --> 09:50.680
Do excuse me,
they cannot be left unattended.

09:53.800 --> 09:59.240
Oh, if you see old Ron,
tell him Charles Gower says hello.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.160
So you're Ron Tate's son?

10:06.160 --> 10:09.520
Phil. Greyvale closed yonks back.

10:09.520 --> 10:10.920
Yes.

10:10.920 --> 10:15.880
Investment for some yuppy Londoners
now. I'm just caretaking.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.880
But you were living here when it was
a children's home?

10:18.880 --> 10:20.360
Working.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.400
As what,
if you don't mind me asking?

10:22.400 --> 10:26.000
Whatever my dad needed.
Handyman mostly.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.280
You would have been
a young man yourself then?

10:30.280 --> 10:32.800
And there were teenage
girls living here?

10:32.800 --> 10:36.200
Yeah, not that kind of handy.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.520
I don't remember none of them
girls being pregnant.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.000
So, where's your dad now?

10:46.000 --> 10:49.160
Nursing home. Not well.

10:49.160 --> 10:52.000
Oh, I'm sorry. Which one?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.480
You deaf? I said he's ill.

10:54.480 --> 10:58.240
It's just possible your dad might
remember something you can't.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.840
My dad worked himself into the
ground looking after them kids,

11:01.840 --> 11:04.040
so you're not to go bothering him!

11:04.040 --> 11:07.640
I'm sorry, but I have to go where my
investigation takes me.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.120
Well, what about records, or notes?

11:15.120 --> 11:17.800
Would your dad have kept
anything on Greyvale?

11:19.240 --> 11:22.120
Suppose there might be some
old photos in the shed.

11:24.880 --> 11:28.160
No, you watch my dinner,
or he'll have it.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.240
DOG GROWLS

11:33.240 --> 11:35.720
LAUGHTER AND CHATTING

11:35.720 --> 11:37.720
Thanks. Mum?

11:37.720 --> 11:41.000
Babe... I think I need a chest rub.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.040
I got that congestion.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.600
You're not the only one.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.520
Mum. Wow! What are they wearing?!

11:47.520 --> 11:49.480
Loons. Yeah. No kidding.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.360
No, I mean the trousers, silly!

11:51.360 --> 11:53.480
I had a pair in crushed velvet.

11:53.480 --> 11:57.400
My glory days. Gallivanting about,
not a care in the world back then.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.880
Babe?

11:58.880 --> 12:01.320
Mum, you were 15 in 1976,
weren't you?

12:01.320 --> 12:03.320
D'you know any of these girls?

12:03.320 --> 12:05.600
Got your message.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.040
This Greyvale?

12:07.040 --> 12:08.640
Yeah.

12:09.680 --> 12:12.320
I think these two were in my year.

12:12.320 --> 12:15.840
Karen Shaw.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.800
And Sarah Millar.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.200
Not sure about the other one.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.480
Lucy? May have been the year above.

12:23.480 --> 12:25.720
D'you remember anything about them?

12:25.720 --> 12:27.920
I had me own crowd.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.960
And then I got busy for the next
eighteen years, didn't I?

12:30.960 --> 12:33.320
Well, would any of your old
crowd know her?

12:33.320 --> 12:35.240
Ooh, I haven't seem 'em for years.

12:35.240 --> 12:37.640
Ask the other two.
I think they live local.

12:37.640 --> 12:40.960
Babe, I think I got
a temperature now!

12:40.960 --> 12:43.840
Well, you know where to stick
the thermometer, don't you!

12:43.840 --> 12:47.360
So, looks like these three girls
would be the right age at the

12:47.360 --> 12:49.920
right time. Hmm.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.720
Thanks.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.440
Where are you going? Wait.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.680
Davey!

12:56.680 --> 12:59.280
A bit of warning might
have been nice.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.720
This is supposed to be
a fun day out -

13:01.720 --> 13:04.760
watching your foster mother hunted
down by the police isn't fun.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.240
No-one's hunting anyone, love.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.320
I just asked your neighbours
where you were.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.880
Well, they shouldn't have said.
There's child-protection issues.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.080
Which bring us back
to the matter in hand.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.880
Karen, do you recognise
this girl from Greyvale?

13:23.520 --> 13:26.120
No, I dunno.

13:26.120 --> 13:29.240
Really?
You two look thick as thieves to me.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.520
I can't remember.
It was a long time ago.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.960
Anything else?
Yeah, how about a DNA sample?

13:35.960 --> 13:37.840
Just to rule you out of our
enquiries?

13:37.840 --> 13:40.640
I think I'd remember
if I'd been pregnant.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.400
I'm sorry, but this is about a baby.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.400
A technician, two seconds
and we won't bother you again.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.920
Fine.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.520
Thank you very much. Much obliged.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.920
She has got her hands full.

13:51.920 --> 13:55.560
Yeah. But some people foster for
the money, though, don't they?

13:55.560 --> 13:58.600
Maybe she's trying to give them
the loving home she never had.

13:58.600 --> 14:02.600
Or maybe she couldn't have
one of her own? Or maybe she did,
and something happened to it?

14:07.960 --> 14:09.640
We've got to do something!

14:09.640 --> 14:11.160
There's nothing we can do.

14:11.160 --> 14:15.640
Here, take these,
everything is going to be OK.

14:15.640 --> 14:18.840
No, it's not! How's it ever going
to be OK again?

14:18.840 --> 14:22.480
They don't know anything.
There is nothing to connect us.

14:23.520 --> 14:25.840
KNOCK AT DOOR

14:25.840 --> 14:28.120
Go in.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.120
Hello.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.120
Sorry to bother you. I'm DS Higgins.

14:39.120 --> 14:42.440
This is my colleague, Jane Kennedy,
the Lighthaven coroner.

14:42.440 --> 14:46.480
We're looking for a Sarah Millar.
W-What's this about?

14:52.880 --> 14:55.080
Headache.

14:55.080 --> 14:58.520
If you'd rather talk without
your husband here...

14:58.520 --> 15:02.320
Oh! Sorry... No, Lee's my brother.

15:02.320 --> 15:05.000
I'm just visiting. From the States.

15:10.600 --> 15:14.200
It's horrible...
I heard on the news.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.480
But I don't know
what I can tell you.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.480
I don't know anything about a baby.

15:18.480 --> 15:23.200
We were hoping you might remember
these two girls.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.400
Karen Shaw?

15:25.400 --> 15:27.160
No. Yeah.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.840
Were you at Greyvale, too?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.960
Are you in there?

15:36.440 --> 15:39.800
No. I hated having my picture
taken back then.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.240
Karen says she doesn't remember you.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.720
It's a lifetime ago, isn't it?

15:47.720 --> 15:50.880
And being in care isn't generally
a memory you cherish.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.040
What about this girl?
Can you give us a name?

15:59.480 --> 16:01.160
Sorry.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.360
Are you sure?
Do you want a closer look?

16:06.360 --> 16:08.480
No, sorry.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.960
Is that it?

16:10.960 --> 16:13.120
We'd like a DNA sample.

16:13.120 --> 16:16.040
To compare with what?
It's 40 years ago.

16:16.040 --> 16:19.080
Well, we might get something back.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.640
OK.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.920
Lovely, smashing. Shall we?

16:35.240 --> 16:38.160
She seemed a bit...flaky?

16:38.160 --> 16:40.320
Yeah. Dependent, even.

16:40.320 --> 16:43.240
But she did agree to a DNA test,
which suggests nothing to hide.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.680
Karen, too.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.680
We need to ID this third girl.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.520
And seeing as Clint hasn't
turned up anything yet,

16:49.520 --> 16:51.840
there's only one person left to ask.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.440
Although Phil Tate's not
going to be happy...

17:19.480 --> 17:21.200
It's been a long time.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.440
I need a favour.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.800
No, I'm working on it.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.200
Basically, it's too long ago
for current records,

17:50.200 --> 17:54.280
but I am into
the council archive room now.

17:54.280 --> 17:57.600
So don't worry,
it's all under control.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.840
Yes, I'll see you later. Bye.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.720
Ah, spiders!

18:06.880 --> 18:09.880
Right, nurse said he can't speak
much since the stroke.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.280
Mr Tate,

18:16.280 --> 18:21.480
I know communication's difficult,
but can you remember this girl?

18:21.480 --> 18:24.000
Her name, perhaps?
Or anything about her?

18:29.720 --> 18:32.360
We think one of these girls
might have had a baby

18:32.360 --> 18:33.960
when they were living at Greyvale.

18:33.960 --> 18:36.520
We've identified Karen and Sarah.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.880
What about any boyfriends
on the scene?

18:48.400 --> 18:51.680
All right. Thanks, Ron.
Sorry to have bothered you.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.440
Oh.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.960
Charles Gower - sends his regards.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.720
Well, another door closes.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.480
Maybe that's just how
it's going to be

19:09.480 --> 19:11.920
until we get something back
from the public appeal.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.560
Clint! What've you got?

19:15.800 --> 19:17.440
Really?

19:17.440 --> 19:18.640
Mr Gower.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.800
Hello. Can we have a word?

19:22.800 --> 19:25.040
Of course.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.760
Charles Gower.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.960
Jane Kennedy.
Coroner for Lighthaven.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.560
Right, Mr Gower,
you'll be very pleased to know

19:31.560 --> 19:34.480
we finally managed to track down
the council records on Greyvale.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.240
Oh, did you? Splendid!

19:36.240 --> 19:38.800
Yeah, it's not all good news,
though, I'm afraid.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.320
Most of the records on residents
were flood-damaged.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.840
However, due to the miracle
of plastic folders,

19:43.840 --> 19:45.400
other things survived.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.920
Including your resignation letter
from 1976,

19:47.920 --> 19:49.800
citing "financial difficulties."

19:49.800 --> 19:50.920
Oh, yes?

19:50.920 --> 19:53.680
Yeah, but the real head-scratcher is

19:53.680 --> 19:55.800
your company records
showed a profit.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.240
So I was just wondering
where the money went.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.080
Whether someone's holding your feet
to the flames over something

20:02.080 --> 20:03.480
or... Something at Greyvale?

20:07.920 --> 20:09.560
No, no, no, no, no..!

20:09.560 --> 20:12.840
No, it wasn't like that.

20:14.320 --> 20:18.320
I had what is today called
an addiction.

20:18.320 --> 20:24.680
But my father laughingly called
"a defect in my moral character."

20:24.680 --> 20:26.240
A defect?

20:26.240 --> 20:27.440
Yes.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.800
Well, gambling.

20:34.520 --> 20:38.120
I got myself into quite a pickle.
Had to resign.

20:38.120 --> 20:41.320
Shameful, I know...

20:41.320 --> 20:44.400
But I had nothing to do
with this business.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.840
I was merely a trustee,
simple as that.

20:47.840 --> 20:51.160
Never hands-on with any of
the young people, like...

20:51.160 --> 20:52.800
Like who?

20:55.680 --> 20:59.560
There were rumours, later on,
that Greyvale...

20:59.560 --> 21:04.320
wasn't so well run by
the family concerned,

21:04.320 --> 21:07.480
and HAD to close.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.520
That's all I know...

21:11.960 --> 21:13.840
Right, OK. Thanks for your time.

21:20.920 --> 21:24.080
He didn't name any names. No. But he
was clearly talking about the Tates.

21:24.080 --> 21:27.200
Yeah, but which one? Ron or Phil?
And either way it's not enough

21:27.200 --> 21:30.400
to bring them in for questioning,
is it? And then he clammed up.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.840
Like he was scared, maybe,
or holding something back?

21:32.840 --> 21:34.800
Just like everyone else
we've talked to.

21:37.640 --> 21:41.400
You think the third girl
could be the mother?

21:41.400 --> 21:44.760
She just looks so lost.
No-one seems to remember

21:44.760 --> 21:48.040
who she is, or what happened to her.
Or the baby.

21:49.160 --> 21:50.880
Two lost souls.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.240
What the hell're you playing at,
eh?! I got a call

21:55.240 --> 21:58.400
from my dad's nursing home! They had
to sedate him after you left!

21:58.400 --> 22:00.640
All right, all right!
Take it easy, my friend!

22:00.640 --> 22:02.840
We were only there for five
minutes and he was fine.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.800
I ain't your friend.
I told her to stay away.

22:05.800 --> 22:07.240
All right, Come on. Come on.

22:09.680 --> 22:14.000
You owe me counselling,
for the spiders. Ugh...

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
And the women... There she is!

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
How are you, my baby?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.520
Still cute and cuddly
as the day you were born.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.960
Yeah, and house-trained now.
Mum, what are you up to?

22:23.960 --> 22:27.920
Oh, rebelling!
Recapturing our lost youth.

22:29.520 --> 22:30.960
Or any other youth.

22:30.960 --> 22:32.760
All right? You lot causing trouble?

22:32.760 --> 22:34.760
'70s night at The Captain's Pipe!

22:34.760 --> 22:37.840
You got me thinking.
Round up the old gang,

22:37.840 --> 22:40.240
paint the town red like we used to
do in the old days!

22:41.600 --> 22:43.840
We were underage back then.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.760
Are they your old school friends?

22:45.760 --> 22:47.800
Tina's still got her old
disco tapes.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.440
We're off now for
a few more bevvies and a boogie.

22:50.440 --> 22:51.960
I'll give you girls a lift.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.040
Come on, you can save your
platforms for Barry White.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.560
Great idea!

22:59.800 --> 23:02.280
You always were a good girl.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.600
Yeah.
We'll catch up on the good old days.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.560
Look at some old photos.

23:06.560 --> 23:09.000
I see you, Davey.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.280
WOMEN CONTINUE CACKLING

23:19.480 --> 23:22.800
It's OK, Dad.
I've sorted the police.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.760
They won't be bothering you again.

23:41.680 --> 23:43.080
Lee?

23:43.080 --> 23:44.400
Lee who?

23:48.680 --> 23:50.280
But...

23:50.280 --> 23:51.400
did you...?

23:51.400 --> 23:53.880
It's all OK now, I promise.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.800
We're safe?

23:55.800 --> 23:57.400
Yeah, see?

23:57.400 --> 24:00.240
I made it all go away,
like always.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.120
Shh. Come on.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.160
BANGING ON DOOR

24:04.160 --> 24:06.320

I don't know what your game is,

24:07.960 --> 24:11.520
but you stay away from my dad
or I'll have you!

24:20.480 --> 24:22.680
(You should leave tonight.

24:22.680 --> 24:25.000

you can do here.

DISCO MUSIC PLAYS

25:03.480 --> 25:05.160
Davey, it's me again.

25:05.160 --> 25:07.160
Listen, Mum's friend ID'd
the third girl,

25:07.160 --> 25:08.680
and I want to hit Sarah with it.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.680
She's obviously the weak link, but
I can't split them up on my own.

25:11.680 --> 25:13.160
I need you to call me back.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.880
Look, call me back.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.200
Samson!

25:29.200 --> 25:31.240
Sammy?

25:31.240 --> 25:32.880
Here, boy!

25:57.200 --> 26:00.880
It was Lisa, wasn't it?
The third girl.

26:02.400 --> 26:05.400
Do you remember her now? No...

26:05.400 --> 26:07.320
Maybe a bit.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.280
No-one really knew her. A bit?

26:11.280 --> 26:12.840
She was your sister.

26:14.120 --> 26:17.720
That's what I've heard
from your school friends.

26:17.720 --> 26:21.920
So where is she, Sarah? Where's
Lisa? What happened? I don't know.

26:21.920 --> 26:25.960
I can't say. Is it Lee?
No! Keeping you quiet?

26:25.960 --> 26:29.040
No! Lisa's gone.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.480
Gone where? She's dead!

26:32.600 --> 26:34.080
Dead?

26:34.080 --> 26:35.480
How?

26:35.480 --> 26:37.360
Sarah, how?

26:42.320 --> 26:44.520
PARTY MUSIC PLAYS

It's just we've had a tip-off
you might be hiding evidence.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.840
Where are you, Lisa?

28:00.440 --> 28:01.840
Hello?

28:04.520 --> 28:06.360
Hello?

28:32.640 --> 28:34.800
You were caught, bang to rights,
my friend,

28:34.800 --> 28:37.520
with this lock of hair in your shed.
No, I've never seen that before!

28:37.520 --> 28:40.320
The preliminary forensic examination
of which suggests it comes from

28:40.320 --> 28:42.400
the hair of that baby.
And I'll bet the DNA backs it up.

28:42.400 --> 28:45.000
I've never seen it! Then what's it
doing in your shed? I don't know!

28:45.000 --> 28:46.800
KNOCK ON DOOR
What?!

28:53.160 --> 28:54.400
All right.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.640
Interview suspended at 10:34.

29:00.240 --> 29:03.440
You have a good think about
what you want to say next.

29:03.440 --> 29:06.640
And it better be a darned sight
better than "I've been framed."

29:13.520 --> 29:16.840
What is it? Did you get my messages?
No, I've been kind of busy here.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.040
I think we need to get CSI back to
the cottage

29:19.040 --> 29:22.400
with ground-penetrating radar.
Why? Sorry, my messages.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.480
So, mum's friend recognised the
third girl. Her name is Lisa.

29:25.480 --> 29:28.280
She was Sarah and Lee's sister.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.800
I just went to confront Sarah
with it and she told me

29:31.800 --> 29:33.240
that Lisa's dead. Dead? How?

29:33.240 --> 29:37.520
She wouldn't say but, Davey,
something's not right.

29:38.920 --> 29:42.160
And then it got me thinking -
I know mitochondrial DNA is the same

29:42.160 --> 29:44.880
between sisters, but what
if Sarah was the mum, she...

29:44.880 --> 29:48.080
Whoa, Sarah is the mum.
The DNA's just come back.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.920
It's a match.
She would have been underage.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.440
And if the father wasn't,
that's rape,

29:53.440 --> 29:55.680
and the baby would have been proof.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.600
So, what if Lisa found out who
the father was

29:57.600 --> 30:00.360
and he killed her and the baby
to hush it all up?

30:00.360 --> 30:02.120
All right.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.280
OK.

30:03.280 --> 30:05.600
So who are you looking at
for the father?

30:05.600 --> 30:06.720
Phil?

30:06.720 --> 30:08.840
He's denying everything, of course.

30:08.840 --> 30:12.280
Said someone drugged his dog
and Lee Millar hassled his dad.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.040
Ron?

30:15.040 --> 30:17.000
Wait. I saw someone
leaving the nursing home

30:17.000 --> 30:19.240
just before we spoke to Ron.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.720
That could have been Lee.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.640
He was at Greyvale.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.320
And he does seem to be going
around keeping everyone quiet.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.600
I mean, Sarah, Ron Tate?

30:27.600 --> 30:30.840
Yeah, but Lee Millar, the dad.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.040
That's incest.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.360
If Lisa found out
and was going to tell,

30:36.360 --> 30:38.760
maybe he had to keep her quiet...

30:38.760 --> 30:39.800
permanently.

30:52.040 --> 30:54.800
Well, well. Gang's all here.

31:01.920 --> 31:05.840
Going somewhere?
Only I could do with a chat.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.080
I've got a plane to catch.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.360
Oh, right, OK. Don't worry.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.640
We'll talk to your sister instead.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.480
So you do all know each other?

31:24.480 --> 31:27.280
You reminded us,
so we got back in touch.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.320
Hm.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.800
We've matched Sarah's DNA
to the baby.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.760
No, you haven't.
It was 40 years ago.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.200
Yeah, well, DNA's come on a lot.

31:35.200 --> 31:37.560
We know the mother was
either Sarah or Lisa.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.400
Yeah, you know your sister...
who died?

31:39.400 --> 31:41.240
Or have you forgotten
her again already? No.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.840
What happened to her, then?
Cos there's no record of her death.

31:43.840 --> 31:46.680
Am I going to find her buried out at
that cottage, too? Leave her alone.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.760
Is Lisa the mother, Sarah,
or are you? Stop!

31:48.760 --> 31:51.720
What did you do to that baby?
She didn't do anything!

32:00.240 --> 32:02.360
I went to the cottage.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.360
Someone cared about that baby.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.720
But who left the third?

32:29.840 --> 32:30.880
I did.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.240
Cos it's your baby?

32:37.000 --> 32:38.680
You were the father. No.

32:38.680 --> 32:41.200
You're lying!
Lee, you have to go now.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.400
We know you went to Ron Tate,
tried to shut him up.

32:43.400 --> 32:46.200
Lee, please.
Did you hurt Lisa or that baby?

32:46.200 --> 32:47.640
I'd never have hurt him. Him?

32:47.640 --> 32:49.720
Oh, no, no...

32:49.720 --> 32:52.040
How do you know it was a boy?

32:52.040 --> 32:53.080
SOBBING

33:00.760 --> 33:02.240
Because it was your baby.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.160
You were Lisa.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.200
I can't keep doing this.

33:21.880 --> 33:22.960
No more lies.

33:50.040 --> 33:53.600
I was...Lisa...

33:55.680 --> 33:57.120
..once upon a time.

34:01.160 --> 34:02.320
But now I'm Lee.

34:04.920 --> 34:07.200
Like I should have been,
from the start.

34:12.639 --> 34:13.679
HE SIGHS

34:19.280 --> 34:21.880
There was a man...

34:25.400 --> 34:26.679
..at Greyvale.

34:29.840 --> 34:31.760
Someone...

34:31.760 --> 34:34.199
we were supposed to
be able to trust.

34:37.400 --> 34:38.679
Charles Gower?

34:43.000 --> 34:46.040
We both caught his eye.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.960
We were too young...

34:47.960 --> 34:49.199
and stupid...

34:50.920 --> 34:52.920
..and petrified to tell anyone.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.880
And no adults noticed?

34:58.000 --> 34:59.560
Later on,

34:59.560 --> 35:00.600
Ron guessed.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.280
Apparently...

35:04.280 --> 35:07.120
Gower made threats.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.600
Friends in high places.

35:10.480 --> 35:13.040
Ron knew that if he rocked the boat,

35:13.040 --> 35:14.800
Greyvale would go down,

35:14.800 --> 35:16.320
and all us kids with it.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.880
Ron was one of the good guys.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.840
But I think it broke him,
in the end...

35:28.800 --> 35:30.520
..that it happened on his watch.

35:32.520 --> 35:35.840
And he closed the place down anyway,

35:35.840 --> 35:38.320
while Gower swanned off
back to his estate.

35:40.440 --> 35:44.480
He could always spot your weakness.

35:44.480 --> 35:45.720
He'd use anything...

35:47.360 --> 35:49.800
..anyone to get what he wanted.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.920
Yeah, I know.

35:53.920 --> 35:57.480
Poor old Ron Tate needed sedating
after just hearing his name.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.400
Lisa was always the strong one.

36:02.920 --> 36:05.480
My big sis, looking out for us.

36:06.480 --> 36:07.520
She...

36:08.520 --> 36:10.440
She distracted him.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.760
She took it all on herself.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.280
OK.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.160
Thank you.

36:31.720 --> 36:36.880
It wasn't my "real" body, anyway...

36:36.880 --> 36:38.760
so I didn't care...

36:40.640 --> 36:42.440
..till I realised I was pregnant.

36:45.480 --> 36:48.040
Being sick in the toilets,

36:48.040 --> 36:50.640
them holding my hair out of my eyes.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.400
Nicking big sweaters
to hide the bump.

36:55.280 --> 36:59.080
We were going to run away
to our secret cottage.

36:59.080 --> 37:01.120
Like Whistle Down the Wind.

37:01.120 --> 37:03.600
Be our own family,
like we'd always wanted.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.280
And is that why the baby was born?

37:09.000 --> 37:10.040
QUIET SOBBING

37:13.760 --> 37:14.800
Tom.

37:16.480 --> 37:19.040
And he was perfect...

37:21.400 --> 37:23.400
..but still.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.880
Lifeless.

37:30.280 --> 37:31.760
He never made a sound.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.720
And we didn't know what to do.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.480
I couldn't leave him there.

37:42.480 --> 37:43.800
Not in the cold ground.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.120
Losing Tom...

37:54.000 --> 37:57.840
..more than ever,
I needed a new start...

37:57.840 --> 38:00.640
a new life...

38:00.640 --> 38:01.840
a new me.

38:05.040 --> 38:09.240
Gender reassignment surgery
was available abroad,

38:09.240 --> 38:10.560
but expensive.

38:10.560 --> 38:11.760
Lee...

38:13.760 --> 38:16.240
I went to Gower...

38:16.240 --> 38:20.640
and I told him that I'd tell,

38:20.640 --> 38:22.160
unless he coughed up.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.920
He didn't even believe
there was a baby at first...

38:29.240 --> 38:30.840
..till I gave him proof.

38:35.160 --> 38:40.160
The proof you gave to Gower
was a lock of Tom's hair.

38:40.160 --> 38:42.920
It's the only piece of him
we would have had left.

38:44.680 --> 38:45.960
I blackmailed him.

38:48.160 --> 38:51.680
And made him resign. Saved Greyvale.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.400
Saved us all.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.040
I went to the Philippines.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.360
I had the hormones,

39:00.360 --> 39:01.680
and later the surgery.

39:05.160 --> 39:06.480
And Lisa died...

39:08.960 --> 39:10.360
..but Lee was born.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.680
And we never forgot
Tom's birthday...

39:19.120 --> 39:21.200
..and the family we made.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.760
'I only went to the cottage
to say goodbye...

39:39.280 --> 39:41.160
'..but he's not there any more.'

39:53.520 --> 39:54.800
What happens now?

40:00.720 --> 40:04.960
Well, I do have good grounds
to believe that Lisa may be guilty

40:04.960 --> 40:06.920
of blackmailing Charles Gower.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.120
GASPING

40:11.000 --> 40:13.880
Only problem is,
there's no Lisa here, is there?

40:45.080 --> 40:47.720
I got you this. Thanks.

40:47.720 --> 40:50.240
So I've released Phil Tate,

40:50.240 --> 40:52.480
told him who framed him,
planted the hair.

40:52.480 --> 40:53.920
How did he take that?

40:53.920 --> 40:55.720
He's not best pleased.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.400
Karen and Sarah have both made
official complaints against Gower

40:58.400 --> 41:00.880
so, all in all, good work.

41:00.880 --> 41:01.920
Oi!
HE WHISTLES

41:04.720 --> 41:07.360
I still don't know how you managed
to find those flowers, though,

41:07.360 --> 41:09.680
when my CSI team couldn't.

41:09.680 --> 41:12.760
Well, you just have to learn
to see things like a woman.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.960
Anyway, I couldn't have
done it without you.

41:16.960 --> 41:19.800
Oh, that's right. Behind every
woman is an even greater man?

41:19.800 --> 41:21.080
Maybe.

41:21.080 --> 41:23.840
You know she's talking
about me, right?

41:23.840 --> 41:25.280
Yeah, all right, cheers.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.080
We should go to court.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.880
Oh, no. Oh...

41:31.880 --> 41:33.720
That's not going to end well.

41:37.680 --> 41:38.720
Told you.

41:54.640 --> 41:58.200
My mouth feels like I
gargled with hamster.

41:58.200 --> 42:00.120
Now who's the lightweight, eh?

42:05.520 --> 42:08.000
Hair of the dog. Oh.

42:10.840 --> 42:13.560
Seems like we both had something
to get out of our system, eh?

42:13.560 --> 42:15.600
Oh, never again.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.920
Moment of madness.

42:18.400 --> 42:24.240
I was trying to find the wild thing
I once was before I got...

42:24.240 --> 42:25.400
busy.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.080
All gone now, though?

42:29.080 --> 42:30.120
No way.

42:32.080 --> 42:34.680
But next time just give us a nudge.

42:34.680 --> 42:35.920
I'll help you find it.

42:38.280 --> 42:39.440
FOOTSTEPS

42:41.560 --> 42:42.960
Oh, you shouldn't have.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.160
Just to say thanks. What for?

42:48.040 --> 42:49.480
Everything.
