WEBVTT

00:21.439 --> 00:23.976
(shoveling continues)

00:28.446 --> 00:31.404
(woman crying )

00:36.412 --> 00:38.698
(crying)

00:42.793 --> 00:45.125
Gabriel: "We look not
at what can be seen,

00:45.296 --> 00:48.163
but we look at what
cannot be seen.

00:48.341 --> 00:51.128
For what can be seen
is temporary...

00:52.470 --> 00:56.804
but what cannot be seen
is eternal.

00:56.974 --> 01:00.762
For we know that if the earthly tent
we live in is destroyed,

01:00.937 --> 01:03.644
we have a building
from God,

01:03.814 --> 01:06.191
a house not made
with hands,

01:06.359 --> 01:08.850
eternal in the heavens."

01:13.241 --> 01:15.527
Noah: She was gonna
come with me.

01:20.957 --> 01:22.948
How far?

01:24.252 --> 01:28.336
Outside Richmond,
Virginia.

01:28.506 --> 01:30.792
(Judith crying)

01:37.848 --> 01:39.884
Rick:
It was secure.

01:40.059 --> 01:43.051
It has a wall,
homes, 20 people.

01:43.229 --> 01:45.015
Beth wanted to go with him.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.896
She wanted to get him there.

01:48.067 --> 01:51.230
It's a long trip,
but if it works out,

01:51.404 --> 01:54.191
it's the last long trip
we have to make.

01:54.365 --> 01:56.572
And what if it isn't around
anymore?

01:57.702 --> 02:00.193
Then we keep going.

02:00.371 --> 02:03.113
Michonne:
Then we find a new place.

02:30.276 --> 02:33.439
(shovel scraping dirt)

02:44.081 --> 02:46.572
It's better now.

03:07.229 --> 03:11.563
(theme music playing )

03:52.233 --> 03:54.394
How far out?

03:56.529 --> 03:58.520
Five miles.

03:59.824 --> 04:01.940
Hey, Carol.

04:02.118 --> 04:03.654
Carol:
I'm here.

04:03.828 --> 04:07.412
We're halfway there.
Just wanted to check the range.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.287
Everybody's holding tight.

04:09.458 --> 04:12.200
We've made it 500 miles.
Maybe this can be the easy part.

04:12.378 --> 04:14.539
Rick:
Got to think we're due.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.965
Give us 20 minutes
to check in.

04:17.133 --> 04:19.169
Carol: We don't hear from you,
we'll come looking.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.174
Rick:
Copy that.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.429
I've been wanting
to tell you something.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.348
What's that?

04:28.519 --> 04:30.805
The trade.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.720
It was the right play.

04:34.567 --> 04:36.307
It worked.
It did work.

04:36.485 --> 04:40.398
Just something else
happened after.

04:40.573 --> 04:42.859
It went the way it had to.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.365
The way it was always going to.

04:47.413 --> 04:50.621
I never wanted to kill
anybody before.

04:51.876 --> 04:53.662
I've wanted that.

04:55.337 --> 04:56.952
But itjust made it

04:57.131 --> 04:59.747
so I didn't see anything
except what I wanted.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.881
I wasn't facing it.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.792
Noah:
Facing what?

05:03.971 --> 05:07.054
What happened,
what's going on.

05:07.224 --> 05:10.136
My dad always
told Sasha and me

05:10.311 --> 05:13.303
that it was our duty
as citizens of the world

05:13.481 --> 05:15.938
to keep up with the news.

05:17.443 --> 05:20.856
When I was little
and lwas in his car,

05:21.030 --> 05:23.521
there were always those stories
on the radio.

05:25.618 --> 05:28.485
Something happens
1,000 miles away

05:28.662 --> 05:31.745
or down the block.

05:33.083 --> 05:36.041
Some kind of horror I couldn't even
wrap my head around.

05:36.212 --> 05:38.168
But he didn't
change the channel.

05:38.339 --> 05:39.749
He didn't turn it off.

05:39.924 --> 05:42.006
He just kept listening.

05:43.219 --> 05:44.629
To face it.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.215
Keeping your eyes open.

05:47.389 --> 05:50.256
My dad always called that

05:50.434 --> 05:52.140
paying the high cost of living.

05:52.311 --> 05:55.474
I lost my dad in Atlanta.

05:55.648 --> 05:57.934
I think he would
have liked yours.

05:59.610 --> 06:03.398
Still got a mom
and a couple of twin brothers.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.402
I hope.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.282
I hope so, too.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.998
Two more miles.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.625
All right.

06:18.796 --> 06:21.378
Let's pull into the woods.
We'll go on foot.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.835
Stay off the road.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.125
Noah:
We don't need to.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.511
Just in case.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.281
Rick:
This is good.

06:54.832 --> 06:57.164
Through the trees, it mightjust look
like part of the wreck.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.995
(snarling, thumping)

06:59.169 --> 07:01.501
(snarling continues)

07:03.841 --> 07:05.877
It's this way.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.240
Your people do this?

07:32.411 --> 07:35.574
Wanted to.
Must have.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.183
Ah!

07:56.226 --> 07:58.217
You all right?

07:58.395 --> 08:01.057
Yeah. Yeah.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.985
We built a perch on a truck.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.825
Sometimes it's out front.

08:25.381 --> 08:27.372
Not today.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.823
(flies buzzing )

09:06.171 --> 09:08.787
( clangs )

09:10.467 --> 09:12.674
( distant bangs )

09:15.013 --> 09:17.265
Noah:
You hear that?

09:19.643 --> 09:21.634
Just wait.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.342
( Noah grunts)

10:00.517 --> 10:03.054
( panting )

10:08.567 --> 10:11.024
Rick:
Noah, hold up.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.357
Noah!

10:28.253 --> 10:30.835
(snarling )

10:35.093 --> 10:37.755
(sobbing )

10:55.948 --> 10:57.939
Come on.
It's all right.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.732
You're gonna be with us now.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.448
(sighs)

11:04.623 --> 11:07.239
(walker snarling )

11:10.087 --> 11:12.078
(sighs)
I'll get him.

11:14.758 --> 11:17.625
(sobbing )

11:31.900 --> 11:33.936
I'm sorry, Noah.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.394
I truly am.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.241
We should see if there's anything
we can use and head back.

11:43.412 --> 11:44.948
Then what?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.871
They see us.

11:55.966 --> 11:58.332
We can make a quick sweep.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.801
I'll stay with him.

12:10.022 --> 12:11.762
Carol, you copy?

12:11.940 --> 12:13.646
Carol:
We're here.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.816
We made it.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.650
It's gone.

12:25.329 --> 12:26.660
(snarling )

12:34.671 --> 12:36.502
Clean shirt.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.792
- We'll figure it out.
-We will.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.255
There's some garbage bags
in the garage.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.012
You didn't think
it would still be here?

12:50.270 --> 12:52.056
Did you?

12:57.861 --> 13:00.273
After it happened,

13:00.447 --> 13:03.189
right after with Beth
in the hospital,

13:03.367 --> 13:06.074
I saw that woman Dawn.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.859
She didn't mean to do it.

13:08.038 --> 13:10.370
I knew it.
I saw it.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.826
But I wanted to kill her.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.956
I remember | just wondered
if it even mattered

13:17.130 --> 13:19.086
one way or another.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.708
Didn't have a thing
to do with Beth.

13:25.639 --> 13:30.429
I don't know if I thought
it would still be here.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.389
But Beth wanted to get him here.

13:34.815 --> 13:37.397
She wanted to get him
back home.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.603
This was for her.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.239
And it could have been
for us, too.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.577
(crying)

14:16.440 --> 14:19.648
I wanted to die for what I lost.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.433
Who I had lost.

14:21.611 --> 14:24.523
I stepped out into
a crowd of those things

14:24.698 --> 14:27.030
just trying to...

14:28.994 --> 14:31.451
take it all out on them

14:31.621 --> 14:33.782
until they took me.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.744
Put them all in front of me
so I didn't see anything.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.625
But ljust kept going.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.412
And then later,

14:42.591 --> 14:45.958
l was there for Judith
when she needed me.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.422
I saved her.

14:48.597 --> 14:51.134
I brought her back to her dad.

14:52.851 --> 14:56.139
And that wouldn't have happened
ifl had just given up...

14:58.398 --> 15:00.980
if I hadn't chosen to live.

15:05.947 --> 15:07.562
Noah.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.149
Noah.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.193
This isn't the end.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.998
Hmm?

15:24.841 --> 15:26.672
There you go.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.834
That's right.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.680
Hey, we should--

15:38.688 --> 15:40.269
Noah.

15:41.817 --> 15:43.307
Noah.

15:43.485 --> 15:44.975
Noah!

15:48.323 --> 15:52.066
l was thinking about that guy
in the storage container.

15:52.244 --> 15:54.235
Back at Terminus.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.703
Howl made us stop.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.089
After the prison,

16:05.257 --> 16:08.624
on my trip,
I got Maggie back.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.585
Things went okay.

16:15.851 --> 16:18.342
Losing Washington...

16:19.729 --> 16:23.267
losing-- losing Beth

16:23.441 --> 16:25.898
right afterjust finding out
she's alive...

16:31.992 --> 16:34.324
I hadn't caught up with you yet.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.405
If it were now...

16:37.914 --> 16:40.075
I wouldn't make us stop.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.576
We'd run right by.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.748
And I would have
shot that woman dead.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.917
Right or wrong.

16:54.598 --> 16:56.759
Michonne:
We need to stop.

17:01.897 --> 17:04.434
You can be out here too long.

17:12.073 --> 17:13.654
Hey, hey.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.036
( panting )

17:18.455 --> 17:20.616
This is my house.

17:22.417 --> 17:23.406
You don't wanna go in there.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.121
Yes, I do.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.792
Let me see it.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.129
Me first.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.440
( pounds)

17:58.453 --> 18:00.193
( pounds)

19:00.390 --> 19:04.508
- Noah: I tried to come back sooner.
- ( creaking )

19:04.686 --> 19:06.347
I tried.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.559
But I did what you told me to.

19:15.196 --> 19:18.484
(snarling, scratching )

19:20.452 --> 19:22.784
(thumping)

20:18.635 --> 20:19.966
(snarling )

20:20.136 --> 20:23.594
( screams )

20:25.058 --> 20:27.800
(growling)

20:35.068 --> 20:36.433
You're okay. Just hold on.
I'll get them.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.442
I'll get-- I'll get them.

20:41.324 --> 20:44.657
( door opens, creaks)

21:00.009 --> 21:03.001
( radio buzzing,
changing channels)

21:07.308 --> 21:09.594
Man's voice:
At least 68 citizens of the republic

21:09.769 --> 21:11.976
have been killed
in four deadly attacks

21:12.147 --> 21:14.684
along the main coastal district.

21:16.860 --> 21:20.694
The group has continued
their campaign of random violence,

21:20.864 --> 21:23.355
moving across
the countryside unfettered

21:23.533 --> 21:27.151
with the republic's
military forces in disarray.

21:27.328 --> 21:30.035
( labored breathing )

21:40.175 --> 21:42.382
I tried to tell you.

21:43.553 --> 21:45.339
I tried to tell you, man.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.378
It was gonna be you.

21:49.767 --> 21:52.383
You're the kind of guy
who saves babies.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.851
You think Gareth would have
been able to follow you guys

21:58.026 --> 22:00.187
if you'd have just put
a bullet in my brain?

22:00.361 --> 22:02.101
Cut me up like your sister did?

22:02.280 --> 22:04.441
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Don't get up.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.902
( breathing heavily )

22:07.076 --> 22:11.911
If I hadn't told them
that you were there,

22:12.081 --> 22:14.242
maybe Gareth wouldn't
have gone after you.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.578
Maybe they wouldn't be dead.

22:16.753 --> 22:18.584
Maybe Bob wouldn't be dead.

22:18.755 --> 22:21.462
Maybe him being alive,
maybe something about that

22:21.633 --> 22:23.589
would have changed
things with Beth.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.593
Domino shit.
( chuckles )

22:27.972 --> 22:29.758
Maybe not.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.974
Maybe you wouldn't
be bit right now.

22:33.144 --> 22:35.260
Bob:
Man, that's bullshit.

22:35.438 --> 22:38.225
I got bit at the food bank.

22:38.399 --> 22:39.730
It went the way it had to,

22:39.901 --> 22:42.608
the way it was always going to.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.644
- Just like this.
- ( static hissing )

22:44.822 --> 22:46.858
Man on radio: ...then terrorizing
the village by night,

22:47.033 --> 22:48.534
carrying out revenge attacks

22:48.701 --> 22:51.113
involving hacking innocents
with machetes

22:51.287 --> 22:54.154
and, in some cases,
setting them on fire.

22:54.332 --> 22:56.789
Martin:
If you just did it,

22:56.960 --> 22:59.542
if you didn't lie like a bitch,

22:59.712 --> 23:01.668
it might have changed things.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.172
Maybe the bill
would have been paid.

23:04.342 --> 23:07.926
Governor:
The bill has to be paid.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.557
You have to earn your keep.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.099
You told me you'd do
whatever you had to do

23:18.439 --> 23:20.179
That's what you said.

23:20.358 --> 23:22.690
Hmm?

23:22.860 --> 23:24.896
Remember that?

23:25.071 --> 23:28.359
- ( static hissing )
- ( snarling over radio )

23:31.160 --> 23:33.287
Lizzie:
It's better now, Tyreese.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.405
It is.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.698
It's better now.

23:37.875 --> 23:40.787
It's not better now.

23:40.962 --> 23:42.372
You know damn well what--

23:42.547 --> 23:44.833
(snarling )

24:23.796 --> 24:26.048
( screams )

24:38.311 --> 24:40.222
( groans )

24:40.396 --> 24:42.728
( breathing heavily )

25:08.758 --> 25:11.921
We could put some of the garage doors
together against the break.

25:12.095 --> 25:14.211
Park a car against them
until we can brick it back up.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.131
Michonne:
It can work.

25:18.309 --> 25:21.267
This place is surrounded
by a forest.

25:21.437 --> 25:23.302
There's no sight lines.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.607
Whoever, whatever
would be on top of us

25:27.777 --> 25:30.143
without us even knowing it.

25:30.321 --> 25:31.481
That's probably what happened.

25:31.656 --> 25:33.612
That's what happened to us.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.650
We could start
taking down the trees.

25:37.829 --> 25:40.115
We use them to build
the walls up.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.490
Look.

26:37.013 --> 26:38.878
It doesn't matter.

26:40.016 --> 26:41.552
What?

26:42.977 --> 26:44.342
You said you wondered
if it even mattered

26:44.520 --> 26:46.385
if you killed her or not.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.388
It doesn't matter if you had done it

26:49.567 --> 26:52.525
or if I had, or that Daryl did.

26:54.155 --> 26:56.146
It doesn't matter.

26:59.702 --> 27:01.784
Michonne:
Washington.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.946
Eugene lied about a cure,

27:05.124 --> 27:07.740
but he thought
of Washington for a reason.

27:07.919 --> 27:08.999
But he was lying.

27:09.170 --> 27:11.502
About the cure,
but he did the math

27:11.672 --> 27:14.709
and realized that Washington
was the place where there'd be a chance.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.042
We're close.

27:18.221 --> 27:19.427
( Rick sighs )

27:19.597 --> 27:23.215
What if there are
people there? Huh?

27:23.392 --> 27:25.428
What if it's someplace
that we can be safe?

27:25.603 --> 27:27.514
We're 100 miles away.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.394
It's a possibility.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.681
It's a chance.

27:31.859 --> 27:34.396
lnstead ofjust being out here.

27:34.570 --> 27:35.685
lnstead ofjust making it.

27:35.863 --> 27:39.447
Because right now,
this is what making it looks like.

27:43.412 --> 27:47.246
Don't you want
one more day with a chance?

27:48.876 --> 27:51.743
(snarling )

27:53.339 --> 27:54.704
Rick:
We should go.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.422
It's 100 miles away.

28:03.808 --> 28:06.424
We should go to Washington.

28:10.773 --> 28:12.013
Noah:
Rick!

28:12.191 --> 28:15.149
Help! Glenn!
Michonne!

28:16.946 --> 28:18.777
(snarling )

28:21.117 --> 28:23.608
Noah:
Help!

28:23.786 --> 28:25.447
Glenn:
Noah, hold on!

28:27.456 --> 28:28.662
lgot him.

28:33.004 --> 28:34.460
( clangs )

28:39.719 --> 28:40.925
You okay?

28:46.517 --> 28:49.600
(grunts)

28:49.770 --> 28:52.147
- lt's Tyreese!
- Where?

28:52.315 --> 28:54.522
My house.
He's been bit.

29:02.199 --> 29:05.191
( buzzing, static hissing )

29:06.579 --> 29:08.285
( channels changing )

29:08.456 --> 29:11.493
(guitar playing)

29:11.667 --> 29:14.374
( channels changing )

29:14.545 --> 29:19.756
J‘ Every man
has a right to live J‘

29:21.135 --> 29:26.004
J‘ Love is all
that we have to give J‘

29:27.516 --> 29:30.178
J‘ Together we struggle... J‘

29:30.353 --> 29:33.891
- ( baby crying)
- J‘ ...by our will to survive J‘

29:34.065 --> 29:39.025
J‘ And together we'll fight
just to stay alive... J‘

29:39.195 --> 29:42.437
(crying continues)

29:42.615 --> 29:46.358
J‘ Struggling man
has got to move J‘

29:49.205 --> 29:53.995
J‘ Struggling man,
no time to lose J‘

29:54.168 --> 29:57.035
J‘ I'm a struggling man J‘

29:57.213 --> 29:59.579
J‘ And I've got to move on. J‘

30:03.594 --> 30:06.301
( static buzzing )

30:06.472 --> 30:08.554
It's okay, Tyreese.

30:08.724 --> 30:10.464
You gotta know that now.

30:13.854 --> 30:18.223
It's okay that you didn't wanna
be a part of it anymore, Ty.

30:19.986 --> 30:22.443
Beth: You don't have to be
a part of it.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.856
(Martin laughing)

30:27.034 --> 30:29.571
(grunts)

30:29.745 --> 30:32.327
See, that's your problem
right there.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.534
What's my problem?

30:34.709 --> 30:38.167
You didn't want to be part of it,
but being part of it is being now.

30:43.092 --> 30:45.253
That's what it is.

30:45.428 --> 30:46.588
Open your eyes.

30:46.762 --> 30:50.129
Lizzie: You don't have to.
Not if you don't want to.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.013
You don't.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.970
It's better now.

30:57.565 --> 30:59.601
You told me
you'd earn your keep.

31:03.029 --> 31:06.988
You had no idea what you were
talking about, did you?

31:07.158 --> 31:08.568
Did you?!

31:09.952 --> 31:13.444
Your eyes were open,
but you didn't wanna see.

31:13.622 --> 31:16.284
Even though I made you see it.

31:16.459 --> 31:18.541
I showed you.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.952
But did you adapt?

31:21.130 --> 31:23.621
Did you change?

31:23.799 --> 31:25.960
No.

31:26.969 --> 31:29.130
That you would sit there
in front of a woman

31:29.305 --> 31:32.092
who killed someone you loved...

31:33.350 --> 31:35.386
and you would forgive her.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.305
That's all there is.

31:43.736 --> 31:45.943
This is all there is.

31:47.031 --> 31:48.487
This is it.

31:48.657 --> 31:51.490
(whimpering)

31:55.664 --> 31:58.121
( panting )

32:02.379 --> 32:05.212
I didn't know
who I was talking to.

32:05.382 --> 32:07.998
I said lwould do what I had to
to earn my keep,

32:08.177 --> 32:10.293
but I didn't know you.

32:10.471 --> 32:12.336
But I know--

32:12.515 --> 32:15.348
I know who lam.

32:15.518 --> 32:19.352
I know what happened
and what's going on.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.771
I know.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.807
You didn't show me shit.

32:24.985 --> 32:29.069
You, you're dead.

32:29.240 --> 32:32.858
Everything that you were

32:33.035 --> 32:35.526
is dead.

32:35.704 --> 32:37.831
And it's--

32:37.998 --> 32:40.740
it's not over.

32:40.918 --> 32:44.206
l forgave her because...

32:44.380 --> 32:46.371
it's not over.

32:47.758 --> 32:50.374
( sobbing )
It's not over.

32:52.513 --> 32:55.971
lt's-- it's not over.

33:03.566 --> 33:05.477
I didn't turn away.

33:06.735 --> 33:08.942
I kept listening to the news

33:09.113 --> 33:11.775
so I could do
what I could to help!

33:14.577 --> 33:16.408
I'm not giving up.

33:16.579 --> 33:18.444
You hear me?

33:18.622 --> 33:20.829
I'm not giving up!

33:28.549 --> 33:30.585
People like me--

33:31.760 --> 33:35.719
people like me,
they can live.

33:40.561 --> 33:43.098
Ain't nobody got to die today.

33:55.117 --> 33:57.608
You have to pay the bill.

33:57.786 --> 34:00.949
( panting )

34:32.196 --> 34:34.027
- You hold him!
- I got it! Go!

34:34.198 --> 34:35.904
Rick:
One hit, clean! Go!

34:39.495 --> 34:42.032
( panting )

34:42.206 --> 34:44.322
(walkers snarling )

34:44.500 --> 34:47.162
- Push it!
- ( grunts )

34:49.046 --> 34:50.832
- ( walkers snarling )
- Glenn: Let's go! Let's go!

34:51.006 --> 34:52.712
- Let's go!
- Michonne: Through the back.

34:52.883 --> 34:54.874
Rick:
We've got to break the chain.

34:55.052 --> 34:56.667
Let's go.

34:58.681 --> 35:00.717
(snarling )

35:02.059 --> 35:04.015
- We can use the bat.
- Noah: I got him.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.469
Can you hold him up?

35:06.647 --> 35:08.478
Yeah.

35:08.649 --> 35:10.685
Rick:
Get ready!

35:19.785 --> 35:21.867
(sound fades)

35:37.845 --> 35:39.710
(snarling )

35:49.898 --> 35:51.934
One, two, three, now!

35:54.570 --> 35:57.061
Man, if you believe that,

35:57.239 --> 35:58.775
then it's definitely
gonna be you and the kid.

35:58.949 --> 36:01.110
(gunshot)

36:01.285 --> 36:03.071
(grunting)

36:06.749 --> 36:08.660
( Sasha screaming )

36:13.088 --> 36:15.545
- No--
- Leave it.

36:15.716 --> 36:18.332
Rick: I got him.
Stay with us, now. Stay with us.

36:19.762 --> 36:22.424
Governor:
You have to pay the bill!

36:22.598 --> 36:25.260
I got you.
Easy now, easy.

36:29.563 --> 36:32.600
- On three. One, two, three.
- ( all grunt )

36:32.775 --> 36:34.015
Michonne: What?
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

36:34.193 --> 36:35.979
- Rick: Come on!
- Noah: Come on.

36:36.153 --> 36:37.768
Glenn:
Open them!

36:37.946 --> 36:41.234
Noah: Come on, man.
Open your eyes. Open your eyes!

36:41.408 --> 36:42.443
(all yell)

36:42.618 --> 36:44.859
Beth:
J‘ Together we struggle J‘

36:45.037 --> 36:48.200
- J‘ By our will to survive... J‘
- It went the way it had to,

36:48.374 --> 36:49.739
the way it was always going to.

36:49.917 --> 36:55.503
J‘ And together we fight
just to stay alive... J‘

36:55.672 --> 36:57.879
You got to hold on, man.
Hold on!

36:58.050 --> 37:00.166
- Glenn: His feet! Get his feet.
- Rick: Two, three...

37:00.344 --> 37:01.754
- ( all grunt)
- Rick: Let's go!

37:01.929 --> 37:06.468
Beth: J‘ Struggling man,
no time to lose J‘

37:06.642 --> 37:09.509
J‘ I'm a struggling man J‘

37:09.686 --> 37:12.678
J‘ And I've got to move on J‘

37:12.856 --> 37:15.939
J‘ I'm a struggling man J‘

37:16.110 --> 37:18.317
J‘ And I've got to move on. J‘

37:18.487 --> 37:19.647
Come on, give him to me.

37:19.822 --> 37:21.733
- Bring him in.
- I got him.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.819
(all grunting)

37:24.993 --> 37:27.826
- Rick: Hold him up. Hold him up.
- You're all right. You're all right.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.576
Carol, we're at the car.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.127
We need to cauterize
the arm and wrap it.

37:34.294 --> 37:36.125
Get Sasha and Carl away.

37:36.296 --> 37:38.002
- They don't need to see this.
- ( engine starts)

37:41.802 --> 37:43.918
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

37:54.231 --> 37:56.643
(snarling )

37:58.444 --> 38:01.857
Noah:
Come on. Come on!

38:16.879 --> 38:19.120
Man on radio: There have been
troubling reports of cannibalism

38:19.298 --> 38:21.163
having broken out
in refugee camps

38:21.341 --> 38:23.832
along the republic's
transportation corridor.

38:24.011 --> 38:26.844
And despite the string
of victories by rebel forces,

38:27.014 --> 38:28.879
there are disturbing reports
of increasing

38:29.057 --> 38:31.218
the brutality of their tactics

38:31.393 --> 38:34.135
including the wholesale
destruction of villages,

38:34.313 --> 38:35.803
burning down local prisons,

38:35.981 --> 38:38.643
targeting of civilians,
and even the widespread

38:38.817 --> 38:41.479
mutilation of children
and young mothers.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.234
And this seems like
only the beginning

38:43.405 --> 38:46.897
of their campaign that they label
as an endless war against...

38:47.075 --> 38:49.157
Turn it off.

38:52.372 --> 38:53.987
You sure?

38:58.712 --> 39:00.873
It's okay, Tyreese.

39:01.048 --> 39:02.663
You gotta know that now.

39:05.969 --> 39:08.221
It isn't just okay.

39:08.388 --> 39:10.253
It's better now.

41:02.878 --> 41:05.085
"We look not
at what can be seen,

41:05.255 --> 41:08.463
but we look at what
cannot be seen.

41:08.634 --> 41:12.218
For what can be seen
is temporary,

41:12.387 --> 41:16.380
but what cannot
be seen is eternal.

41:18.977 --> 41:23.641
For we know that if the earthly tent
we live in is destroyed,

41:23.815 --> 41:26.898
we have a building from God,

41:27.069 --> 41:30.812
a house not made from hands,

41:30.989 --> 41:34.072
eternal in the heavens.

41:38.163 --> 41:39.869
In the heavens."

42:11.738 --> 42:14.229
(shoveling continues)

42:23.041 --> 42:26.033
(shoveling continues)
