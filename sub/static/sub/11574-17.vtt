WEBVTT

00:12.013 --> 00:13.628
Kenzi!

00:16.058 --> 00:17.434
Bonus.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.225
More Piles O' Pecans for me.

00:26.944 --> 00:30.937
You want to be the champion, baby?
You got to be ready for anything.

00:31.032 --> 00:33.193
Kenzi, you just killed my ice cream.

00:33.284 --> 00:35.991
Collateral damage. Killer Kitty!

00:40.082 --> 00:42.368
The Garuda could strike
anywhere, anytime.

00:42.460 --> 00:43.666
Reverse Cowgirl.

00:55.473 --> 00:59.386
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Just tacos. Don't kill me.

00:59.477 --> 01:03.015
Oh, hey, baby.
Did you bring extra hot sauce?

01:09.737 --> 01:11.978
What was that?

01:12.073 --> 01:14.860
--Sword-lates.
--Blade-aerobics.

01:14.951 --> 01:17.408
You are the strangest
girls I've ever met.

01:17.495 --> 01:20.202
Making with the sweet talk.

01:21.791 --> 01:25.500
What can I say? We like
to get our freak on.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.746
Right.

01:28.089 --> 01:30.250
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate her seeing me.

01:30.341 --> 01:31.672
Save it for the Don.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.750
Your family's been loyal
to clan Bukharin?

01:33.844 --> 01:36.005
Over seven generations now.

01:36.097 --> 01:38.679
ljust have a... a little
business problem.

01:38.766 --> 01:42.054
Some new investors.
Very unsavoury fellows.

01:42.144 --> 01:44.726
Again, I'm just the consigliere.

01:46.524 --> 01:50.108
Marisol Carmody in her prime.

01:50.194 --> 01:52.185
I can see why they call her the Iron Fist.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.190
Don't crack jokes.

01:53.281 --> 01:55.943
--Oh, I didn't mean--
--And don't forget to curtsey.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.739
You have ten minutes, Nigel.

01:57.827 --> 02:02.947
The Don's a real stickler for protocol.
And a real hothead when crossed.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.125
[screaming]

02:08.212 --> 02:09.998
What was that?

02:17.847 --> 02:19.758
Ms. Carmody!

02:24.145 --> 02:27.057
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:27.148 --> 02:30.060
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

02:30.151 --> 02:33.063
My love carries a death sentence.

02:33.154 --> 02:35.236
l was lost for years,

02:35.323 --> 02:37.939
searching, while hiding,

02:38.034 --> 02:42.243
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

02:42.330 --> 02:47.165
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.963
So... was Ms. Carmody a smoker?

02:59.055 --> 03:01.341
Not for two centuries.

03:04.393 --> 03:08.102
We don't often have a member
of clan Zamora under our roof.

03:08.189 --> 03:09.679
I'm just here to do my job.

03:09.774 --> 03:11.435
[DYSON] With a little help.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.685
You're late.

03:12.777 --> 03:14.688
Is this your commanding officer?

03:14.779 --> 03:15.768
Hardly.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.024
Yes.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.777
And not affiliated with
any particular clan.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.824
Thank goodness.

03:22.912 --> 03:24.322
You let me know if you need anything.

03:24.413 --> 03:27.997
I will. And thank you.

03:29.085 --> 03:31.292
What was that?

03:31.379 --> 03:33.961
An attempt to let you
off the case gracefully.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.458
Your father called.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.379
He called you?

03:36.467 --> 03:38.708
Says you being here
is bad for appearances.

03:38.803 --> 03:41.920
Yeah, well, whatever.
He doesn't run my life.

03:42.932 --> 03:44.843
We're cool, right?

03:48.813 --> 03:52.351
Yeah. We're cool. We're peachy!

03:52.441 --> 03:54.648
So, the old lady just went kablooey?

03:54.735 --> 03:55.815
Can we focus?

03:55.903 --> 03:59.145
I'm sorry, it's just so deliciously gross.

03:59.240 --> 04:02.653
Okay, continue with your bro bitchin'.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.358
I hate what Dyson's become.

04:04.453 --> 04:07.365
Totally unreliable.
And he doesn't give a damn.

04:07.456 --> 04:10.994
I'm sorry you guys are
having a boy fight.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.370
I could use a friend.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.201
Aw, hon.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.459
A girlfriend.

04:18.968 --> 04:19.753
Hear me out.

04:19.844 --> 04:22.927
The once-a-century summit of the
original noble Fae families is coming up

04:23.013 --> 04:24.549
and I need a date.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.177
Hale, l have a boyfriend now.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.508
| show up with you,

04:28.602 --> 04:32.186
it'll really get my family off my
back about my personal life, Kenzi.

04:32.273 --> 04:35.515
Boyfriend. Me. Have.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.726
If I may, I have taken the liberty

04:38.821 --> 04:41.437
of writing out all the times
that l have bailed you out.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.363
--Seriously?
--One--

04:43.451 --> 04:46.113
erased all your parking tickets
from the police database.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.455
Two--rescued you from that minotaur.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.530
He was only a little drunk.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.206
Three--nodded knowingly
when you told Bo

04:53.294 --> 04:55.410
her shoes were stolen by a cobbler elf.

04:55.504 --> 04:59.247
Those mules were way
too small for her!

04:59.341 --> 05:01.377
--Four--
--Fine!

05:01.469 --> 05:02.424
Yes.

05:02.511 --> 05:06.220
Fine, |'|| pose as your
honey, temporarily.

05:06.307 --> 05:10.641
No smooching, no groping,
and no magical Fae impregnations.

05:10.728 --> 05:13.265
I'll try and contain myself.

05:14.482 --> 05:15.892
--Here.
--What's this?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.644
--|t's a present.
--Oh!

05:17.735 --> 05:19.726
Aha!

05:19.820 --> 05:23.062
Yeek! Mm!

05:23.157 --> 05:26.615
It's my Nona's old lnverell
gown and fascinator.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.248
You're kidding.

05:35.336 --> 05:38.499
It's just like Nona used to wear.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.752
What time is this... summit thing-y?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.628
Tomorrow.

05:43.719 --> 05:47.303
But first, you're meeting my family.

05:48.516 --> 05:53.476
This is Marisol Carmody,
Don of the Bukharin clan.

05:53.562 --> 05:57.931
--Last night, she was--
--Exploded. Yeah, I heard.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.607
So, are Dyson and Hale on it?

06:00.694 --> 06:03.811
Hale has removed himself from
the case and with good reason.

06:03.906 --> 06:06.989
His father's head of the Zamora clan.

06:07.076 --> 06:08.782
How many clans are there again?

06:08.869 --> 06:14.614
Well, when it comes to Fae nobility,
there are only three clans that matter--

06:14.708 --> 06:17.040
the Zamora, Bukharin, and Fin Arvin.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.789
All who are rich and very powerful
and would kill each other in a heartbeat

06:19.880 --> 06:22.166
in order to gain more
power and more money.

06:22.258 --> 06:24.840
Like the mob, but with mermaids.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.134
Yeah.

06:27.221 --> 06:30.213
So, why would someone
want Marisol murdered?

06:30.307 --> 06:32.298
You mean why now?

06:32.393 --> 06:36.306
This weekend,
the lnverell is happening.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.683
And it is critical that nothing
disturbs the precarious peace

06:38.774 --> 06:41.857
between these three families.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.150
Like, say, the Garuda?

06:43.237 --> 06:46.695
Yes. I want you to partner with
Dyson and find out who did this.

06:46.782 --> 06:48.363
Also, I think it would be
a good opportunity

06:48.450 --> 06:51.487
if you let the families
know what's coming.

06:51.579 --> 06:55.322
You earn their support and we can
tap into their significant resources.

06:55.416 --> 06:58.328
Right. Tip the scales in our
favour when we go into battle.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.910
Exactly.

07:01.005 --> 07:06.170
Remember one thing, Bo--these people
are conservative, prejudice snobs.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.797
They don't take too kindly to riff-raff.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.225
Hey, hey. You okay?

07:17.313 --> 07:19.429
Uh, yeah.

07:19.523 --> 07:24.233
Okay, wait. lt's just--look,
my family's a little old school, so--

07:24.320 --> 07:28.939
Okay, well, relax. I got this.
It's me, remember?

07:33.704 --> 07:37.367
Val, Father.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.245
This is Kenzi, my girlfriend.

07:41.629 --> 07:45.542
Hello, Sturgess.
It's very nice to meet you.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.375
Too early to call you Dad?

07:48.469 --> 07:49.925
Human!

07:58.479 --> 08:01.061
Son...

08:01.148 --> 08:03.935
...you're dating this?

08:05.194 --> 08:08.277
Kenzi. Her name's Kenzi.

08:10.658 --> 08:15.448
So, Val, is that, um, is that short for
Valerie or 'cause you're a Valkyrie?

08:15.537 --> 08:18.404
I'm a Pombero. I can steal voices.

08:18.499 --> 08:22.913
And, seriously, Hale,
a human in our house?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.118
Shut it, Val.

08:24.213 --> 08:25.874
You shut it.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.086
Children, that's enough.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.510
Sweetie, give your
brother back his voice.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.137
--Harpie.
--Human hugger.

08:39.228 --> 08:42.470
Really, Hale, it's one thing
to work alongside them.

08:42.564 --> 08:44.600
I'm right here.

08:44.692 --> 08:47.434
I can hear you, so...

08:47.528 --> 08:48.938
Mom would understand.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.486
Well, we know you take
after your mother.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.736
My only son, a Siren.

08:57.246 --> 09:01.330
Best damn Siren in the
whole biz, this one!

09:01.417 --> 09:07.378
As Santiagos of clan Zamora,
we're all for charity, but there's a limit.

09:07.464 --> 09:12.834
And that limit is cheap, ill-bred mortals.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.555
--[BO] Hey, guys.
--Hey.

09:18.642 --> 09:22.351
So, what made our vic
go boom? A bomb?

09:22.438 --> 09:24.019
[DYSON] Take a look.

09:25.441 --> 09:26.977
So, what's your plan?

09:27.067 --> 09:31.811
I say we pull the suspects in,
get old school, force a confession.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.362
Or we could examine the evidence.

09:34.450 --> 09:38.318
Like, for example, this photograph.
This is the three clans, right?

09:38.412 --> 09:40.198
Yes, from the last lnverell.

09:40.289 --> 09:43.156
Well, it's burned around the edges.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.706
Message from the killer.

09:44.793 --> 09:48.160
Seems like our suspects
are also potential targets.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.746
So, we bring in the heads
of the other families.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.877
lnterview them.

09:52.968 --> 09:57.382
But I must warn you,
they are a prickly bunch.

09:57.473 --> 10:00.590
It will be the first time the lnverell
has been held here at our estate

10:00.684 --> 10:04.302
under the clan Zamora
banner in three hundred years.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.056
Hi.

10:09.151 --> 10:10.231
Kenzi.

10:10.319 --> 10:15.063
Yes. That's me.
Hale's monogamous lover.

10:16.617 --> 10:19.279
Mr. Santiago. It's an honour.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.281
Dyson, my boy, I didn't think
you were going to make it.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.987
Neither did I.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.248
Who's your friend?

10:27.336 --> 10:28.701
Everyone, this is Bo.

10:28.796 --> 10:32.129
The unaligned succubus.

10:32.216 --> 10:35.208
The rumours don't do
your beauty justice.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.920
Mr. Santiago, unfortunately,
we're here on business, not pleasure.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.720
And, boy, do we have questions.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.470
Of course, the Marisol murder.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.221
Dreadful affair.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.725
There's no reason we couldn't
do this over some rare vintages.

10:48.816 --> 10:51.148
Shall we adjourn to the wine cellar?

10:51.235 --> 10:53.271
Any thoughts on who
might want Marisol dead?

10:53.362 --> 10:55.398
[STURGESS] Oh, I'm
quite sure who did it.

10:55.489 --> 10:58.652
Dabner, the head of the Fin Arvin clan.

10:58.742 --> 11:03.327
Paranoid, nearly insane and you
can't trust those Fin Arvin fools.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.029
They're as shiftless as mortals.

11:07.668 --> 11:08.748
What are you doing?

11:08.836 --> 11:10.417
You're speedy.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.586
Not the Chateau lsoir, dear.

11:12.673 --> 11:15.961
Perhaps you'd prefer a wine cooler.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.473
We should talk to this Dabner, now.

11:32.568 --> 11:33.774
Ag reed.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.442
[STURGESS] Not before cake.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.191
Don't you want dessert, Dyson?

11:38.282 --> 11:44.528
First, we divide it equally to pay
homage to the original families.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.954
l'm nothing if not sentimental.

11:48.041 --> 11:52.375
Wash the silverware the
human uses at least twice.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.202
Val!

11:54.298 --> 11:57.040
Better just pitch it.

11:57.134 --> 12:00.467
You know what, that's it. Fae you.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.215
You know, if I wanted
to be insulted like this,

12:02.306 --> 12:05.343
I would have spent time
with my own family!

12:09.605 --> 12:11.061
Kenzi.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.684
Kenzi, wait. Hey, Kenzi, wait.

12:16.778 --> 12:20.487
Yes, our friendship works because we are
so the best-dressed out of the group

12:23.243 --> 12:25.825
But I have never used
you like you just used me.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.869
Hey, look, I'm sorry.

12:27.956 --> 12:31.369
Okay, they're rude, they're bigots,
and they're wrong. I get it.

12:31.460 --> 12:36.830
Well, get this--next time you want
to play bad son, leave me out of it.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.006
Thank you for your time.

12:39.092 --> 12:43.335
And here I'd heard you were difficult.
Dyson's clearly been a good influence.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.545
So has Kenzi.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.178
See, she's taught me how to
tolerate people that I can't stand.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.350
You're snobs, you're bigots,

12:50.437 --> 12:53.179
--Bo.
--and your fam--

12:53.273 --> 12:56.015
...family home is lovely.

12:56.109 --> 13:01.229
And Dyson, come back any time
you feel like something sweet.

13:03.659 --> 13:06.366
So much for impressing
our social betters.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.364
Well, I still have two families to charm.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.618
Besides, that was worth it.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.580
You have got to stop
sneaking in like this.

13:19.675 --> 13:21.211
Or what?

13:21.301 --> 13:24.418
Find out my girlfriend stood
me up for another dude?

13:28.850 --> 13:34.766
If it makes you feel any better,
it was, like, the worst date of all time.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.731
Baby, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

13:38.819 --> 13:43.984
So, it was a date and--
and what, it was awesome? Yay!

13:46.368 --> 13:49.405
You and l, we were supposed to jam
and instead, I see you leave with Hale.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.612
Baby, he's just my friend.

13:51.707 --> 13:55.620
Okay? It was a... thing.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.002
I can't keep up with your secrets, Kenz.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.249
What do you mean?

14:00.340 --> 14:04.674
Well, first Bo and now
Hale and everything.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.382
but you're always so...

14:15.564 --> 14:17.304
...sneaky.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.309
Okay, it's--it is adorable, but--

14:22.404 --> 14:26.147
No, you're right.
You're right and it is killing me.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.983
I want to tell you the truth.

14:33.457 --> 14:35.869
Dabner, I presume?

14:35.959 --> 14:39.372
More often referred to as Lord Dabner.

14:39.463 --> 14:41.954
Ninth Premier of the clan Fin Arvin.

14:42.049 --> 14:47.464
But who cares about hard-earned
titles in these troubled times?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.795
And what brings you
to us today, Lord Dabner?

14:49.890 --> 14:54.554
It came into my house,
my very boudoir.

14:54.644 --> 14:59.229
I woke to find it standing
above me, aflame.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.147
Like on fire?

15:01.234 --> 15:04.146
Beauty and brains.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.614
So often strangers.

15:07.657 --> 15:11.991
I will have you know that
I barely escaped with my life.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.660
--I am a Fin Arvin.
--My Lord...

15:13.747 --> 15:16.204
I am not to be silenced.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.543
Your hand, it's burnt.
Did the creature touch you?

15:22.756 --> 15:26.214
I never noticed. It all happened so fas--

15:32.974 --> 15:36.387
Whatever did this just
sent more than a message.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.103
You okay?

15:44.194 --> 15:46.276
Yeah, a bit congested.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.694
When a Cherufe touches you,

15:47.781 --> 15:51.114
it sets off a chain reaction
and you spontaneously combust.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.737
Gruesome trick.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.113
Wait. What's a Cherufe?

15:54.204 --> 15:57.196
A Cherufe is an Underfae of magma.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.279
lmmensely powerful.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.037
It can cover swaths of land in lava.

16:01.128 --> 16:04.211
And disguise themselves as rock.

16:04.297 --> 16:08.085
Why would a Cherufe waste its
talents tormenting these individuals

16:08.176 --> 16:09.916
when it could wipe out
an entire village?

16:10.011 --> 16:14.095
Well, there must be some reason
because these attacks are pretty specific.

16:14.182 --> 16:17.219
And there's only one Don left.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.766
Hale's dad.

16:18.854 --> 16:20.139
I mean, he's a total jerk off,

16:20.230 --> 16:23.563
but capable of hiring an assassin
to take out the other clan leaders?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.983
It looks like we're heading
back to the Santiago estate.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.951
Is that my Piles O' Pecans?

16:39.332 --> 16:41.493
I told Nate the truth about us.

16:41.585 --> 16:43.621
Oh, Kenzi!

16:43.712 --> 16:46.670
Except I totally lied!

16:46.756 --> 16:48.087
Oh, Kenzi.

16:48.175 --> 16:51.793
I don't know, it just--it just came pouring
out of me that you and l were spies.

16:51.887 --> 16:53.923
That we were in the
witness protection program.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.426
That we were this close to
getting our own cooking show.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.928
Oh, that one, that's when
he knew you were lying?

16:59.019 --> 17:00.634
Yeah.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.762
Now I know why he's mad,

17:03.857 --> 17:06.269
because I'm pretending to
be Hale's piece on the side.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.851
Well, then you tell Hale
that you can't do it anymore.

17:09.946 --> 17:13.109
I mean, if he knew that this was
affecting your real relationship--

17:13.200 --> 17:15.441
He won't want to take me
to the lnverell anyway,

17:15.535 --> 17:17.116
considering his family hated me.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.319
Oh, they sucked.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.449
They so sucked.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.997
[knocking]

17:23.084 --> 17:25.211
I'm going to head to the Dal,
give them the news.

17:25.295 --> 17:28.833
But honey, I don't think that your
problems with Nate are just a Fae thing.

17:28.924 --> 17:34.089
I mean, it is hard to be in a relationship
when you can't be completely honest.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.720
You rang?

17:37.807 --> 17:42.301
Yeah. Hey, yeah, thanks for
coming, this case is a doozy.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.805
Hey, Bo.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.479
Hey, Nadia.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.397
[LAUREN] I brought those, um...

17:48.485 --> 17:49.816
[KENZI] Later.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.519
...medical text books you wanted.

17:52.614 --> 17:53.649
Great. Thanks.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.900
Where's your bathroom?

17:54.991 --> 17:57.073
--|t's upstairs.
--|t's upstairs.

18:02.582 --> 18:06.325
Sorry. I had to bring her.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.875
Okay.

18:09.422 --> 18:13.085
She just hasn't wanted to leave
my side, which is understandable,

18:13.176 --> 18:16.839
considering the coma and
waking up after five years.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.262
Yeah, sure. It's fine.

18:20.475 --> 18:24.969
The Ash's library has volumes
dedicated to the Cherufe.

18:26.356 --> 18:30.440
And even among the Fae,
they're admired for being so...

18:30.527 --> 18:32.392
--I don't know--
--Bad-ass?

18:32.487 --> 18:33.727
Precisely.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.858
It was a Cherufe that
was responsible for the

18:35.949 --> 18:38.235
volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.738
The city of Pompeii
was buried in minutes,

18:40.829 --> 18:44.413
exterminating entire
generations of humans and Fae.

18:44.499 --> 18:47.957
The Fae have another word for Pompeii.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.715
They call it the Rape of Scafati.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.256
Wait. I've seen that word before.

19:00.807 --> 19:05.050
See? There. On Marisol's desk, Scafati.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.262
But why would Marisol
Carmody have it?

19:10.317 --> 19:13.354
Do you get the impression there's
something the Dons aren't saying?

20:02.869 --> 20:04.575
You find anything good?

20:10.710 --> 20:14.999
You got quite the weapons collection.

20:15.090 --> 20:17.832
Well, everyone's got their hobbies.

20:17.926 --> 20:21.009
As if you weren't
intimidating enough already.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.679
Bo, I'm so sorry. |--|'m so embarrassed.

20:28.770 --> 20:36.063
|just--| just wanted to
check out the competition.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.484
Look, Nadia, I'm not your competition.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.313
You really have nothing to worry about.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.865
You won't tell Lauren?

20:43.952 --> 20:50.118
Well, it's not like I've never peeked
inside someone's medicine cabinet, right?

20:51.418 --> 20:53.784
Yeah. Thanks.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.841
[TRICK] Hale, four o'clock.

21:05.932 --> 21:10.221
Oh, there she is, my main squeeze.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.597
--Hey, Trick.
--Here you go.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.554
Were we in the same room yesterday?

21:14.649 --> 21:16.185
That was crazy town.

21:16.276 --> 21:20.189
That was Thursday.
The estate is always kind of intense.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.441
Nate doesn't get why
I'm doing this, Hale.

21:22.532 --> 21:24.193
Well, then I will tell him.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.570
You are doing me the
biggest favour of my life.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.242
Besides, if you bail,

21:28.329 --> 21:31.571
our fake relationship will be one
more thing my father thinks I failed at.

21:31.666 --> 21:34.123
Yeah, well, if you wanted to
impress Papa Sturgess so mucho,

21:34.210 --> 21:36.417
why don't you just ask Bo?

21:36.504 --> 21:40.292
My family is nuts,
but I am the Santiago heir.

21:40.383 --> 21:43.716
Someday, I might be
head of the Zamora clan.

21:43.803 --> 21:47.591
And you need a tiny human
queen to claim your throne?

21:47.682 --> 21:50.219
I need to set an example.

21:50.310 --> 21:53.643
If we don't modernize,
we will become irrelevant.

21:53.730 --> 21:58.269
Look, the Fae can co-exist with
the humans peacefully as equals.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.395
Moreover, we should.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.569
No fair with the
"We're all on one team" speech.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.486
You know Mighty Ducks is my fave.

22:04.574 --> 22:07.441
Oh? Well, I would have never guessed

22:07.535 --> 22:12.279
when you made me
watch it... nine times.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.332
One more night.

22:16.419 --> 22:19.582
Yes. One more "you don't
even have to be sober" night.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.082
Oh, that's great.

22:21.174 --> 22:22.630
Ha!

22:34.854 --> 22:38.096
How did you get in here?
| doubled security.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.931
Well, double it again.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.857
A Cherufe is after you.

22:41.945 --> 22:44.482
That is unless you hired it
to kill the other two Dons.

22:44.572 --> 22:47.439
If you wanted to borrow a bottle,
you could have just asked.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.321
The one that Kenzi was looking at?

22:50.411 --> 22:54.324
I noticed it was the only bottle on
the shelf that didn't have any dust on it.

22:54.415 --> 22:57.248
I believe it was the Chateau lsoir.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.666
Is that French for family secrets?

23:17.272 --> 23:20.856
I bet you a wine cooler that this
scroll will tell me about Mr. Scafati.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.398
May |?

23:25.738 --> 23:28.855
The Scafati wasn't a person,
they were a family.

23:28.950 --> 23:30.315
A fourth clan.

23:30.410 --> 23:34.449
You sliced the cake into four equal
parts to pay homage to the families.

23:35.456 --> 23:37.833
Our superstitions will always betray us.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.579
The Scafati clan was more
powerful than the Zamora,

23:40.670 --> 23:43.412
Fin Arvin and Buhkarin
kinfolk combined.

23:43.506 --> 23:45.838
So, together we conspired
to destroy them.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.166
By using the Cherufe who
lived below Mount Vesuvius.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.001
And in return, we promised
him the first girl born

23:50.096 --> 23:51.552
to each family every hundred years.

23:51.639 --> 23:55.006
Well, let me guess--you welched
on your daughter deliveries.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.342
We tricked the creature instead
and buried him under the mountain.

23:57.437 --> 23:58.893
Not deep enough.

24:01.441 --> 24:04.854
I understand his need for revenge,
but not why he's coming after us now.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.354
It's been 2000 years.

24:06.446 --> 24:10.359
I've got an inkling.
You ever hear of the Garuda?

24:10.450 --> 24:14.068
Sturgess, you have got
to stop the lnverell.

24:14.162 --> 24:16.869
And let the clan say I
cancelled out of fear?

24:16.956 --> 24:18.867
I'd rather burn.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.074
Oh! Oh!

24:24.339 --> 24:26.580
Sturgess, open this door!

24:27.634 --> 24:29.420
Oh, damn it.

24:48.363 --> 24:49.819
Sorry, Nona.

25:04.337 --> 25:07.750
Emmett Northcote.

25:07.840 --> 25:13.130
Of family Northcote, clan Fin Arvin.

25:14.347 --> 25:17.305
Tamsin Borgia.

25:17.392 --> 25:23.262
Of family Akif, clan Bukharin.

25:23.356 --> 25:24.937
Where are you, Kenzi?

25:25.024 --> 25:26.639
Kenzi.

25:30.238 --> 25:37.360
Hale's bitchin' girlfriend
of family Whatup,

25:37.453 --> 25:40.365
clan Hey Now.

25:44.752 --> 25:46.913
Come along, miss.

25:55.054 --> 25:58.888
I had to do it my way. I didn't
want to look like a before picture.

25:58.975 --> 26:02.138
You look gorgeous, really.

26:02.228 --> 26:06.813
Really? Not too goomba?

26:06.899 --> 26:09.857
It's perfect.

26:09.944 --> 26:11.400
Okay.

26:22.415 --> 26:27.660
Word of the Don's deaths have
positively blazed through the crowd.

26:27.754 --> 26:30.086
They can all burn as
far as I'm concerned.

26:30.173 --> 26:35.213
Pompous fools muttering and
posturing amongst themselves.

26:35.303 --> 26:38.670
You should get out of here,
Val, something bad is coming.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.881
I'd rather dance.

26:40.975 --> 26:43.557
You're my best friend's baby sister.

26:45.438 --> 26:48.396
l'm nobody's baby anymore.

26:48.483 --> 26:51.520
And I know you've noticed.

26:51.611 --> 26:54.353
I've noticed something, too.

26:54.447 --> 26:59.441
You're... different.

26:59.535 --> 27:03.528
lam. So, don't think you know me.

27:03.623 --> 27:08.538
You don't give a rat's ass
about anything, do you, Dyson?

27:08.628 --> 27:12.962
Liberating, isn't it? Not having to care.

27:13.049 --> 27:14.960
l was eavesdropping on

27:15.051 --> 27:18.919
Sturgess and your little succubus
friend in the wine cellar earlier.

27:19.013 --> 27:20.423
Bo is downstairs?

27:20.515 --> 27:27.227
Turns out Daddy dearest is
not exactly the stand-up guy I...

27:31.984 --> 27:33.440
Hey...

27:35.863 --> 27:38.400
Don't go all gallant on me now.

27:38.491 --> 27:41.233
That's not what I'm after.

27:41.327 --> 27:48.165
I plan to drown my sorrows
in something... wrong.

27:49.544 --> 27:52.081
Why else would I choose you?

27:52.171 --> 27:53.832
I'm working.

27:55.383 --> 28:02.050
If you want to feel something
for a change, come find me.

28:31.752 --> 28:33.208
Nate?

28:37.383 --> 28:39.294
Ow. Ow. Ow.

28:39.385 --> 28:40.670
You're crushing my fingering hand.

28:40.761 --> 28:42.171
What?

28:42.263 --> 28:43.548
Guitar.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.630
--How did you get in?
--I got in with the caterers.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.306
Well, what are you doing here?

28:47.393 --> 28:50.476
I'm finding the balls
to get my girl back.

28:50.563 --> 28:54.727
Oh, okay. Wait here.

29:01.157 --> 29:04.149
Yep, there it is, heard another "mercy."

29:04.243 --> 29:06.154
That was number four, yep.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.907
Oh, and the lady in the
red sequins gave us a "crikey."

29:08.998 --> 29:13.492
See? We're uniting Fae from many lands
in their utter disapproval of our love.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.827
I'm still smarting from
that guy's "harrumph."

29:15.922 --> 29:18.709
No, if words were bullets--

29:18.799 --> 29:20.255
You're fun.

29:20.343 --> 29:21.173
Thanks.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.672
It's kind of why I asked
you to this cluster-Fae.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.674
Oh, yeah, what happened
to, "I am chosen one.

29:25.765 --> 29:28.723
Must date human,
drag Fae into new century"?

29:28.809 --> 29:29.719
Ha, ha, ha.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.846
And yeah, that's important but

29:31.938 --> 29:35.681
this is the next best thing
to having an actual girlfriend.

29:35.775 --> 29:38.892
The unaligned succubus.
Family unknown, clan--

29:38.986 --> 29:40.567
Zip it. Now.

29:40.655 --> 29:42.236
Hey, Bobo.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.030
What the hey-hey?

29:45.117 --> 29:48.530
Yeah, yeah, no invitation,
underdressed, do not tell your dad.

29:48.621 --> 29:49.906
Look, there's someone
else who shouldn't be here

29:49.997 --> 29:51.282
and he's waiting for
you in the billiard room.

29:51.374 --> 29:53.410
Oh, okay.

29:59.548 --> 30:01.925
--Dude.
--Dude.

30:02.009 --> 30:04.466
Dude!

30:04.553 --> 30:06.930
And that's my cue.

30:09.642 --> 30:12.384
Can we please say
something other than dude?

30:12.478 --> 30:16.096
Well, I said a bunch of stuff the
last time I saw you and you freaked.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.647
In my defence, | asked you for the truth

30:18.734 --> 30:21.225
and you told me that
you were Batman. So...

30:21.320 --> 30:23.561
Well, fine. I fibbed. Great catch.

30:23.656 --> 30:29.822
And that's just it, you are
a great catch. The best.

30:33.416 --> 30:36.032
Leaving more slowly.

30:37.086 --> 30:40.920
And you look so, so amazing.

30:41.007 --> 30:44.465
And the most pathetic part is
is that I am so crazy about you that

30:44.552 --> 30:48.591
it practically wouldn't matter if
you were dating a cop on the side.

30:48.681 --> 30:53.766
Nate, I'm just pretending to be Hale's
faux-beau to get his parents off his back.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.468
Oh.

30:57.857 --> 31:01.099
Well, that's cool, yeah.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.808
Yeah?

31:05.072 --> 31:06.778
Are we cool?

31:06.866 --> 31:08.948
I hope so.

31:09.035 --> 31:13.495
There are still some things
that aren't mine to tell.

31:13.581 --> 31:16.323
You know, I don't care what
the deal is between you and Bo,

31:16.417 --> 31:18.783
'cause I know who you really are.

31:18.878 --> 31:22.496
Yeah. I'm yours.

31:30.056 --> 31:32.138
Look, |-| can't do this right now.

31:32.224 --> 31:35.057
l have to go make a good impression
and my Spanx are riding up

31:35.144 --> 31:37.851
and the man I love is playing stalker.

31:41.776 --> 31:43.516
You love me.

31:47.156 --> 31:48.862
Busted.

31:55.081 --> 31:59.120
That's good enough for me.
Now go be good for Hale.

32:10.179 --> 32:11.635
Bitch!

32:42.670 --> 32:45.878
Hey. Have you seen Dyson?
I need his help finding the Cherufe.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.876
Whoa, whoa, it's coming
here to my house?

32:47.967 --> 32:51.960
Yes, we think so. Look, if you
see Dyson, send him my way, okay?

32:54.682 --> 32:56.547
I hope you're not
planning anything stupid.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.974
You mean like saving your sorry ass?

33:14.368 --> 33:16.154
[gasping]

34:24.563 --> 34:26.224
Are you okay?

34:26.315 --> 34:27.771
Where'd it go?

34:30.069 --> 34:32.401
What happened to your voice?

34:32.488 --> 34:34.729
Okay, stay here, okay?

34:47.002 --> 34:49.835
Wait, wait!

34:49.922 --> 34:51.833
We should go upstairs.
We shouldn't do this.

34:51.924 --> 34:54.040
Is that really what you want?

35:39.054 --> 35:40.510
Val!

35:42.349 --> 35:44.886
Hale, just relax.

35:44.977 --> 35:48.435
Don't make this a thing, man.

35:48.522 --> 35:50.058
A thing?

35:50.149 --> 35:52.060
We're both consenting adults.
It doesn't concern you.

35:52.151 --> 35:54.767
Like hell it doesn't, she's my sister!

35:54.862 --> 35:57.649
And you're supposed to be my
best friend. What's wrong with you?

36:14.423 --> 36:16.288
Time to cool things off.

36:17.885 --> 36:21.048
Really? There's no Fae fire code?

36:25.517 --> 36:28.850
| always stuck by your side, man,
and this is how you repay me?

36:28.937 --> 36:32.680
I may not be able to love,
Hale, but I can still live.

36:32.775 --> 36:35.141
Hale!

36:35.235 --> 36:37.442
What are you going to do, huh?

36:37.529 --> 36:39.861
You going to hit me?

36:39.948 --> 36:42.530
Then do it.

36:42.618 --> 36:44.199
Do it!

36:52.252 --> 36:54.208
You're not worth it.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.337
Come on.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.853
Kenzi, Reverse Cowgirl!

37:36.588 --> 37:39.250
Asian fusion's so hot these days.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.792
[whistling]

37:45.931 --> 37:49.423
It is bad enough that you made
a deal with the devil and then reneged!

37:49.518 --> 37:54.103
But the reason the Cherufe felt
bold enough to seek vengeance now

37:54.189 --> 37:59.183
is because there is something
much worse slouching towards us.

37:59.278 --> 38:00.814
The Garuda!

38:02.823 --> 38:06.407
You are all at each other's throats,
even more than usual.

38:06.493 --> 38:10.281
And the evil that is coming, it is
feeding off your collective rage!

38:10.372 --> 38:12.579
This is ridiculous!
You don't understand!

38:12.666 --> 38:15.408
No! This is our shot, Dad.

38:17.629 --> 38:22.248
To stop the petty grievances with
each other and unite the clans.

38:22.342 --> 38:24.082
To fight the real threat.

38:24.178 --> 38:26.134
[EMMETT] It's another
clan Bukharin trick!

38:26.221 --> 38:29.839
You would say that, Fin Arvin scum!

38:33.812 --> 38:36.144
They'll never change.

38:36.231 --> 38:38.722
It's over.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.353
No.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.191
Changed my mind.

38:49.411 --> 38:51.572
Now it's over.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.449
Give it back, Val.

38:57.503 --> 38:59.664
Lava dude's in here!

39:02.007 --> 39:04.919
I'm sorry, that was a long holdover.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.126
--Come on, let's go.
--Okay.

39:12.226 --> 39:14.308
One minute, Hale. My son, please.

39:14.394 --> 39:17.807
What could you possibly
have to say to me?

39:17.898 --> 39:21.265
The Cherufe--| only did it
to keep the family safe.

39:21.360 --> 39:24.523
You did it because you need
to be in control all the time.

39:24.613 --> 39:26.524
But you can't control what's coming.

39:26.615 --> 39:28.446
We've had our differences,

39:28.534 --> 39:31.150
but when the Garuda comes,
we need to stick together.

39:31.245 --> 39:34.453
Look after our own.

39:34.540 --> 39:38.283
l'll protect Val.
| always do when it counts.

39:38.377 --> 39:39.992
The Garuda...

39:42.297 --> 39:44.128
You did know about it.

39:44.216 --> 39:47.800
You were right, succubus. I can feel it.

39:47.886 --> 39:52.505
The enemy of the Naga,
of all the Fae rises.

39:52.599 --> 39:53.509
We'll fight it.

39:53.600 --> 39:58.640
You'll lose. But still,
I admire your gumption.

39:58.730 --> 40:02.018
And I'll offer any
resources you may need.

40:04.611 --> 40:06.272
That's a start.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.696
Good-bye, Kenzi.

40:18.166 --> 40:20.703
Is that my Nona's fascinator?

40:32.472 --> 40:35.054
This is unbelievable.

40:35.142 --> 40:38.179
I figured old Sturgey wouldn't mind.

40:38.270 --> 40:39.680
Besides, we deserve it.

40:39.771 --> 40:40.681
For what?

40:40.772 --> 40:43.434
I couldn't even convince the Fae
nobles to help us fight the Garuda.

40:43.525 --> 40:46.232
I mean, I'm not the
best public speaker but

40:46.320 --> 40:49.187
I had a great prop,
a freakin' lava monster's head.

40:49.281 --> 40:51.613
It wouldn't have mattered if
you slayed an army of Underfae.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.691
The clans know what's
coming, but they're scared.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.197
Yeah, but your peeps can't
just put their heads in the sand

40:56.288 --> 40:58.449
and hope that their money
and power will save them.

40:58.540 --> 41:01.532
They've lived behind their privileged,
sheltered lives for centuries.

41:01.627 --> 41:04.585
It's made them soft.

41:04.671 --> 41:09.461
My mom used to talk about it.
Told me I could be more.

41:09.551 --> 41:11.758
That's why I became a cop.

41:11.845 --> 41:14.211
And a great cop at that, sir.

41:14.306 --> 41:17.264
--[BO] Here. Here.
--Cheers.

41:17.351 --> 41:20.718
But the point is I'm
willing to throw it all away.

41:20.812 --> 41:21.927
Me too.

41:22.022 --> 41:25.981
And so is Trick and Lauren and Dyson.
We all have your exquisitely toned back.

41:26.068 --> 41:27.103
Well, thank you.

41:27.194 --> 41:28.980
Don't bet on Dyson.

41:29.071 --> 41:35.158
Besides, I wouldn't fight at
his side, anyway. Not anymore.

41:35.243 --> 41:36.323
[NATE] Knock, knock.

41:36.411 --> 41:37.571
[KENZI] Hey.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.119
That's my cue.

41:40.540 --> 41:44.249
And I should go to bed before
I spontaneously collapse.

41:44.336 --> 41:46.622
You have fun with my girl?

41:49.591 --> 41:52.082
You're a lucky man.

41:52.177 --> 41:53.758
Hi. One sec.

41:53.845 --> 41:56.803
Hale, hey.

41:56.890 --> 41:58.426
Oh, no, no, no, no. You keep it.

41:58.517 --> 42:00.758
No, no, no. Come on, it was your Nona's.

42:00.852 --> 42:05.437
Did I mention the sparkly
bits are genuine sapphire?

42:05.524 --> 42:07.936
Damn.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.142
No! No, I can't. Take it.

42:10.237 --> 42:13.445
Look, you were the perfect girlfriend.

42:13.532 --> 42:15.488
You deserve it.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.658
Thank you.

42:23.709 --> 42:27.952
Baby. I'm fancy, huh? l'm fancy, huh?

42:28.046 --> 42:29.206
--[NATE] He gave that to you?
--Yes.

42:29.297 --> 42:31.913
--That's absolutely beautiful.
--|t's real sapphire.

43:06.418 --> 43:07.874
Nadia!

43:09.796 --> 43:11.411
My god, what happened?

43:11.506 --> 43:14.498
Uh... I cut myself.

43:14.593 --> 43:16.675
--A stupid accident.
--Your hand...

43:16.762 --> 43:19.720
What were you doing with the knife?

43:19.806 --> 43:21.842
The knife?

43:21.933 --> 43:23.798
I don't remember.

43:25.937 --> 43:28.770
Lauren, I'm scared.

43:28.857 --> 43:32.566
It's okay. It's okay.
