00:00.069 --> 00:03.788
When I'm working on a case
I'm kind of a lone wolf.

00:03.867 --> 00:06.238
Do you supply a gun or
should I bring my own?

00:09.107 --> 00:12.112
This may be the only time in my
life I get to go under cover.

00:13.044 --> 00:16.852
What the hell is this? You're
trying to inhale my fiancÃ©.

00:16.916 --> 00:20.823
I cannot believe that a hot shot P.l.
like you is gonna wimp out on me.

00:20.886 --> 00:22.022
I'm not wimping out.

00:23.156 --> 00:24.692
Rita! Jump!

00:26.427 --> 00:27.595
Go!

01:39.762 --> 01:43.136
I have always been a believer
in seeking fresh experiences,

01:43.199 --> 01:44.802
learning new things.

01:44.868 --> 01:48.576
My grandfather used to say, "We
should pattern our lives after fish."

01:48.640 --> 01:51.112
"If you don't keep swimming,
you die."

01:51.176 --> 01:54.448
Now, I support every creature's
right to selF-FulFillment.

01:54.514 --> 01:56.751
But anything can be overdone.

01:59.952 --> 02:01.722
All right, Higgins, you got me.

02:02.756 --> 02:06.463
Maybe you have succeeded in teaching
them a couple of basic hand signals.

02:06.528 --> 02:10.469
I have taught them the complete
Forbes-Davies Silent Sentry System.

02:10.532 --> 02:13.204
Thirty-four distinct,
unvoiced commands.

02:13.268 --> 02:16.742
But there is one big flaw in
your Forbes-Davies, Higgins.

02:16.806 --> 02:19.344
What if someone gives
them a different command?

02:34.493 --> 02:37.232
When the lads are working, you
don't exist for them, Magnum.

02:37.296 --> 02:40.002
Unless I happen to
designate you as prey.

02:40.066 --> 02:41.067
Prey?

02:47.308 --> 02:48.577
Prey, Higgins?

02:50.845 --> 02:53.083
Don't you think I should
know this prey signal?

02:53.148 --> 02:54.788
Frankly, you should
know the whole system,

02:54.850 --> 02:57.121
but you'll undoubtedly
shirk your duty to learn it.

02:57.186 --> 02:58.621
Shirk? I don't shirk, Higgins.

02:58.688 --> 03:00.648
Really? Two weekends ago,
you promised to assist me

03:00.657 --> 03:03.529
with the new members party for the
Anglo-Hawaiian Investment Club,

03:03.594 --> 03:05.230
but you went spear
fishing instead.

03:05.295 --> 03:07.165
That was not shirking,
that was forgetting.

03:07.231 --> 03:09.102
I'd been wanting to go spear
fishing for six months.

03:09.167 --> 03:10.647
When the opportunity
presented itself,

03:10.702 --> 03:12.907
it simply drove everything
else out of my head.

03:12.971 --> 03:14.708
A remarkably easy feat.

03:17.576 --> 03:18.612
Yes?

03:18.678 --> 03:20.581
Uh, Benny Travis to see Magnum.

03:23.684 --> 03:27.625
Come on, Higgins, Benny's not such a bad
guy. Come to the main house, Benny.

03:27.688 --> 03:29.893
How you can maintain a
relationship with someone

03:29.957 --> 03:33.096
who is undoubtedly the absolute
dregs of your profession

03:33.161 --> 03:34.998
is beyond human comprehension.

03:35.063 --> 03:36.566
Benny performs
a valuable service.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.903
Someone has to take those
disgusting little cases

03:38.967 --> 03:41.038
that lead through all
the sewers in Honolulu.

03:41.104 --> 03:42.874
Besides, he's given
me some good tips.

04:00.192 --> 04:03.097
He's undoubtedly come to you
to secure an unsecured loan,

04:03.163 --> 04:05.367
which you'll undoubtedly
try to borrow from me,

04:05.432 --> 04:06.935
which I will undoubtedly refuse.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.006
You know, Higgins, smugness is not
one of your endearing qualities.

04:12.307 --> 04:14.412
Magnum, thank God you're here.

04:15.511 --> 04:16.713
Hi, Benny.

04:17.579 --> 04:18.748
Hi, Hig.

04:18.815 --> 04:21.019
So, Benny,

04:21.083 --> 04:22.419
how's it going?

04:22.485 --> 04:25.090
How's it going? Is
this a month or what?

04:25.155 --> 04:28.997
I been chasing this wandering
hubby, and my motor burns out.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.431
And then I'm tailing
this broad for three days

04:31.496 --> 04:33.366
and I find out the broad
I'm tailing is the sister

04:33.432 --> 04:34.993
of the broad I'm
supposed to be tailing.

04:35.001 --> 04:37.773
And then, to top it off,
two of my three clients

04:37.837 --> 04:40.309
stiffed me with bad checks.
That's how it's going.

04:40.373 --> 04:42.477
Well, I'm sorry to hear
about your troubles, Benny.

04:42.542 --> 04:44.847
Actually, I haven't been
doing so well myself.

04:46.246 --> 04:48.951
Ah, too bad, 'cause you
know, I turned it around.

04:49.017 --> 04:52.290
I mean, I got a great iob,
cash on the barrelhead.

04:52.354 --> 04:53.522
Oh, yeah?

04:54.222 --> 04:57.729
So you don't need
any financial help?

04:58.227 --> 04:59.529
No way.

04:59.595 --> 05:00.831
In fact...

05:00.897 --> 05:04.137
I'm on the job now.
That's why I'm here.

05:04.201 --> 05:06.371
Come on, call them off.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.173
Cut it out, Higgins.
Put them outside.

05:08.238 --> 05:09.908
Quit being such a sore loser.

05:11.309 --> 05:13.379
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

05:15.247 --> 05:16.882
Say, is Robin Masters around?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.118
Well, that's a good
question, Benny.

05:18.183 --> 05:19.451
See, I have this theory that...

05:19.519 --> 05:22.191
You know perfectly well
Mr. Masters is in Europe.

05:22.255 --> 05:25.528
Oh. Sorry, Benny,
no introduction today.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.473
Oh, that's all right,
you've done enough for me.

05:27.495 --> 05:30.300
Jonathan Quayle Higgins, in
the absence of Robin Masters,

05:30.364 --> 05:32.502
I'm officially serving you
these court documents

05:32.567 --> 05:35.572
pertaining to a lawsuit
filed by Chester Bixby

05:35.637 --> 05:38.075
against you and
the Masters estate.

05:38.641 --> 05:39.642
Lawsuit?

05:40.209 --> 05:42.513
What on earth are
you talking about?

05:42.578 --> 05:44.683
Couple of weeks ago,
at a party here.

05:44.748 --> 05:47.753
Mr. Bixby tripped over a loose
piece of carpeting and fell.

05:47.819 --> 05:49.154
Oh, that chap.

05:49.587 --> 05:51.958
He said he was fine.
It was just a little accident.

05:52.023 --> 05:54.495
Well, now he's claiming
hidden back injuries,

05:54.559 --> 05:56.397
pain and suffering,
mental stress.

05:56.462 --> 05:59.134
Two million dollars' worth.
It's all in the documents.

05:59.198 --> 06:01.135
And thanks for letting
me into this fortress.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.103
I could have never
got in here without you.

06:03.169 --> 06:04.272
See ya.

06:07.975 --> 06:09.210
Thanks again.

06:09.977 --> 06:11.313
Mr. Travis.

06:11.779 --> 06:13.182
I have one question.

06:13.247 --> 06:16.187
How are you planning to get
from this doorstep to your car?

06:20.355 --> 06:22.092
Oh, wait! Wait a minute!

06:22.692 --> 06:25.064
Hey! Open the door!

06:25.129 --> 06:27.334
All right, how was I supposed
to know why he came here?

06:29.567 --> 06:31.370
It's not only this! If you'd been
at the party as you promised,

06:31.435 --> 06:34.208
this Bixby fellow would never had
attempted that cheap charade.

06:34.272 --> 06:35.474
How do you know
it was a charade?

06:35.540 --> 06:36.541
I know.

06:36.608 --> 06:40.116
And since you're in charge of security
here, it's your job to prove it.

06:40.179 --> 06:42.717
Wait a minute.
Wait just a minute!

06:42.783 --> 06:44.887
How come every time there's
a crummy job to be done,

06:44.952 --> 06:46.087
I'm in charge of security?

06:46.154 --> 06:47.991
But every time there's
big money to be spent

06:48.056 --> 06:50.661
or credit to be taken,
you're in charge of security?

06:50.725 --> 06:53.965
Because that is the order
of the universe.

07:01.537 --> 07:02.907
Macadamia nuts?

07:02.973 --> 07:06.981
You want me to fly you all the way
to Maui for a jar of Macadamia nuts?

07:07.044 --> 07:11.854
Of course not. There's also pork rinds
and potato chips, snacks for the trip.

07:11.917 --> 07:14.589
I'm talking camaraderie here,
T.C., not commerce.

07:15.354 --> 07:18.326
Sorry, comrade, I'm booked.
Day one of a five-day charter.

07:18.390 --> 07:20.695
What's the big emergency
on Maui anyway?

07:20.760 --> 07:22.330
I have to locate a flopper.

07:22.762 --> 07:23.965
A flopper, huh?

07:26.534 --> 07:28.237
You don't have to
go to Maui for that.

07:28.302 --> 07:31.642
All you have to do is get one of
Rick's girlfriends in a string bikini.

07:31.706 --> 07:35.915
A guy who takes falls in public, T.C.,
and then sues for fake injuries.

07:35.978 --> 07:37.380
A flopper. Flopper?

07:37.445 --> 07:39.550
Wasn't that the name
of the rabbit in Bambi?

07:39.615 --> 07:42.253
No, no, no. Flopper,
the evil twin of Flipper.

07:42.819 --> 07:44.822
That's not funny, T.C.,
it's not funny at all.

07:44.888 --> 07:47.093
This guy's putting the
squeeze on a friend of ours.

07:47.158 --> 07:48.293
Who?

07:48.725 --> 07:49.727
Higgins.

07:50.128 --> 07:51.729
Thought you said it
was a friend of ours.

07:51.763 --> 07:55.237
I tracked this guy, Bixby, to a local
hotel, they said he's visiting Maui.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.306
Couldn't we just hop on over
before you clients get here?

07:58.370 --> 08:00.674
I don't have the time,
nor the appetite.

08:00.739 --> 08:03.479
Well, that's it, then.
You're forcing me into it.

08:03.543 --> 08:05.380
There's no alternative. What?

08:05.445 --> 08:07.616
I'll have to do it.
I don't want to do it.

08:07.682 --> 08:09.202
I don't think it's
completely my fault.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.588
I think you will have to
share some of the blame.

08:11.652 --> 08:12.720
Blame?

08:14.288 --> 08:15.624
Blame for what?

08:15.691 --> 08:17.428
Well, I'll have to
sign up for one of those

08:17.492 --> 08:19.429
three-day, two-night
Maui excursions

08:19.494 --> 08:21.014
with the money-back
guarantee and then,

08:21.064 --> 08:22.700
once I get there
and do my business,

08:22.765 --> 08:25.838
I'll have to lie about being
dissatisfied and get my money back.

08:26.402 --> 08:28.240
That's disgusting.

08:28.606 --> 08:29.841
How'd you think of it?

08:29.907 --> 08:32.746
Benny Travis told me. He takes
all his vacations that way.

08:39.885 --> 08:42.590
Looks like you've definitely
got a paying client this time.

08:42.655 --> 08:43.758
Yeah.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.994
Some big wheeler-dealer
from the mainland.

08:50.064 --> 08:51.434
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:51.499 --> 08:52.601
One of you my pilot?

08:52.667 --> 08:54.303
Uh, me. Theodore Calvin.

08:54.369 --> 08:56.339
Welcome to Island Hoppers.

08:56.404 --> 08:58.609
Oh, this is, uh, Thomas Magnum.

08:58.674 --> 09:00.511
He's my head of security.

09:00.576 --> 09:03.449
Hi, Joe Hatten, President
of E 8 N Industries.

09:03.513 --> 09:04.615
You heard of me.

09:04.681 --> 09:06.051
Uh, no, sorry.

09:06.117 --> 09:07.887
I was in The Times last month.

09:09.453 --> 09:10.755
Joe. What?

09:11.323 --> 09:12.959
Everyone's been
introduced but...

09:13.025 --> 09:15.129
Well, you got a mouth,
you wanna talk, talk.

09:15.193 --> 09:17.665
Hi, I'm Rita Parks,
Joe's fiancÃ©.

09:17.729 --> 09:19.332
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.

09:19.398 --> 09:20.433
Nice to meet you.

09:20.499 --> 09:21.568
You have such a lovely island...

09:21.634 --> 09:23.069
Okay, okay, can it, huh?

09:24.138 --> 09:25.507
I'm in garbage.

09:25.571 --> 09:28.277
Of course, nowadays everybody wants
to call it waste management,

09:28.343 --> 09:30.513
but it's garbage,
plain and simple.

09:30.577 --> 09:32.982
Yeah, so is this
security business.

09:33.715 --> 09:35.050
Excuse me.

09:36.018 --> 09:37.688
I ain't ashamed of what I do.

09:37.753 --> 09:41.393
Hell, I dropped out of ninth grade
to work on a garbage truck.

09:41.857 --> 09:44.295
Six years later, I owned
the whole damn route.

09:44.361 --> 09:46.833
Now, I'm the biggest garbage
man on the East Coast.

09:47.397 --> 09:48.766
Uh, congratulations.

09:49.233 --> 09:52.273
I'm over here to check out your
problems, and you got plenty.

09:53.272 --> 09:55.877
If you don't get some new landfill
sites in the next couple of years,

09:55.941 --> 09:58.111
you're all gonna be up to
your butts in wet garbage.

09:58.177 --> 09:59.280
No kidding.

09:59.345 --> 10:01.750
Maybe I should try to corner
the market on hip boots, huh?

10:03.216 --> 10:06.089
Hip boots, that's
pretty good, Magnum.

10:06.153 --> 10:08.925
So, you're head of security
around here, huh?

10:08.989 --> 10:10.559
I got one question.

10:10.624 --> 10:12.194
What the hell have
you got to secure?

10:12.260 --> 10:14.030
Oh, uh...

10:14.528 --> 10:16.499
Thomas just works
for me part-time.

10:16.565 --> 10:19.070
He's one of the best private
investigators on the island.

10:19.135 --> 10:20.838
You're a detective?

10:20.903 --> 10:22.105
Uh, private investigator.

10:22.171 --> 10:23.440
Like on TV?

10:23.506 --> 10:25.276
Well it's not really like
that, not all the time.

10:25.342 --> 10:26.377
Oh.

10:26.442 --> 10:28.078
Oh, he's just being modest.

10:28.145 --> 10:30.885
In fact, he's working on a
really big case right now.

10:30.949 --> 10:36.593
It's not really a big case, it's just a
standard, uh, somewhat exotic, case.

10:37.189 --> 10:39.226
Oh, you're a
detective in Hawaii.

10:39.291 --> 10:42.899
Do you realize you have one of the
most exotic jobs in the whole world?

10:42.963 --> 10:45.935
Oh, come on, tell us something
about one of your cases.

10:45.999 --> 10:47.335
No, we got to go.

10:47.401 --> 10:51.543
Just because your head's already floating
around in the clouds don't mean ours are.

10:53.574 --> 10:55.511
Okay, uh...

10:56.577 --> 10:57.746
I'm ready if you are.

10:57.813 --> 10:59.048
Yeah, I should be going, too.

10:59.114 --> 11:01.319
Listen, uh, those excursion
flights leave pretty early.

11:01.384 --> 11:03.254
Joe, nice to meet you.
Same here.

11:03.319 --> 11:04.455
Bye-bye.

11:20.339 --> 11:21.575
No glamour, huh?

11:22.376 --> 11:24.546
Rita, get your tail
in this helicopter,

11:24.610 --> 11:26.513
or you're gonna walk
back to the hotel.

11:35.924 --> 11:40.033
One of the pleasanter after-effects
of nearly meeting your maker

11:40.095 --> 11:43.268
is a renewed sense
of the value of all life,

11:43.333 --> 11:46.606
of every creature's right
to realize its full potential.

11:47.137 --> 11:50.010
In fact, I was quite
pleased recently

11:50.074 --> 11:53.180
when I managed to avoid stepping
on an ordinary garden snail.

11:53.744 --> 11:58.153
Pleased that it could crawl on to fulfill
its full garden snail potential.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.390
So you are here.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.456
Higgins.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.628
I assumed you would be
out working on the case.

12:06.693 --> 12:07.694
Don't you ever knock?

12:07.760 --> 12:09.330
You've got company.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.201
Hi.

12:14.236 --> 12:15.404
Hi.

12:16.472 --> 12:19.411
Oh, such a nice
place you got here.

12:20.943 --> 12:22.613
Are you all right, Magnum?

12:22.678 --> 12:25.083
You seem a little
distracted lately.

12:25.148 --> 12:27.720
Huh? Uh, I... No, I'm fine.

12:27.784 --> 12:29.954
You got this whole big estate
and you live in the bungalow?

12:30.020 --> 12:31.991
Well, it's cozier here,
it's, uh,

12:32.589 --> 12:34.694
more comfortable. What
brings you here, Rita?

12:34.759 --> 12:36.195
I do!

12:37.662 --> 12:40.034
Oh, it's Joe. You're with Joe.

12:40.099 --> 12:41.268
I know.

12:41.334 --> 12:43.271
Hey, those two
Dobermans are dynamite.

12:43.336 --> 12:45.139
I taught them to
fetch my wallet.

12:45.205 --> 12:48.010
Bet they could do a real
job on a burglar, huh?

12:48.976 --> 12:50.078
Indeed.

12:50.144 --> 12:53.551
Zeus and Apollo are the best trained
canine sentries on this island.

12:53.614 --> 12:55.250
Zeus and Apollo?

12:55.317 --> 12:59.158
Don't you think those names are
a little poofy for attack dogs?

12:59.555 --> 13:01.225
Poofy? Higgins,

13:01.291 --> 13:02.694
the sooner that, uh,

13:02.759 --> 13:05.998
we finish our business here, the sooner
I can take care of that other matter.

13:06.062 --> 13:07.265
Very well.

13:08.966 --> 13:11.203
Perhaps the lads and I
will see you again.

13:12.002 --> 13:13.171
Good night.

13:16.509 --> 13:18.713
English butlers are
always so snooty.

13:19.245 --> 13:20.982
I'd dump the guy, Magnum.

13:21.047 --> 13:24.052
Yeah, well, he's been here for years.
I wouldn't feel right about it.

13:24.116 --> 13:26.722
Well done, Zeus.
Now, watch me carefully.

13:26.787 --> 13:28.122
Listen, can I get you a...

13:28.188 --> 13:29.925
Magnum, we need to talk.

13:29.990 --> 13:31.526
Did you solve your case today?

13:31.592 --> 13:33.797
Uh, sure. Uh, not yet.

13:33.861 --> 13:37.936
Oh, I ain't the type to beat around
the bush, Magnum, so, uh, here it is.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.204
Did you get in any gun battles
or, like, fistfights?

13:40.269 --> 13:43.776
Uh, no, I fired a couple of warning shots
at the teller who short-changed me but...

13:43.839 --> 13:45.877
Steady on, Apollo.

13:45.942 --> 13:49.549
Rita here is tired of flying
around looking at landfill sites.

13:49.613 --> 13:52.352
Oh, I'll bet you had some great
chases in that sports car.

13:52.416 --> 13:55.656
Hey, can it, will you? Can't you see
I'm trying to talk business here?

13:57.322 --> 14:01.497
As I was saying, she keeps yapping
about this private detective racket.

14:01.561 --> 14:04.300
So, uh, I was wondering
if maybe, uh...

14:04.364 --> 14:06.836
Maybe she could tag along
with you for a couple of days.

14:08.669 --> 14:10.640
No offense, Joe, I...

14:10.704 --> 14:12.174
That's not a good idea.

14:12.240 --> 14:16.882
See, Rita, when I'm working on a
case, I'm kind of a lone wolf.

14:17.413 --> 14:19.116
I'll pay you 600 a day.

14:20.783 --> 14:22.018
$6oo?

14:22.084 --> 14:23.219
A day.

14:25.021 --> 14:26.124
Well...

14:26.189 --> 14:29.796
Rip and shred, lads,
destroy the enemy!

14:29.860 --> 14:31.430
Rip and shred!

14:33.331 --> 14:36.036
Uh, that's a very
generous offer.

14:36.100 --> 14:39.207
But, I mean, if it was another
case with another client...

14:40.540 --> 14:43.178
I just can't.
No, I... No, I can't.

14:43.243 --> 14:45.748
Hey, no problem. I wouldn't
do it if I were you.

14:45.812 --> 14:47.615
Just because her yammering
is driving me nuts,

14:47.681 --> 14:49.551
is no reason you
should go through it.

14:49.617 --> 14:52.222
Didn't I tell you it was a dumb
idea, that he'd never go for it?

14:52.286 --> 14:53.455
Let's get out of here.

14:53.522 --> 14:55.425
Guess I'm just
being stupid again.

14:55.490 --> 14:57.227
No, wait a minute, now.

14:57.292 --> 14:58.995
Destroy the enemy.
What the heck.

14:59.562 --> 15:02.701
Even a lone wolf could use some
good company now and then.

15:02.764 --> 15:03.833
You'll do it?

15:07.638 --> 15:09.141
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

15:09.907 --> 15:11.477
All right, yeah, okay.

15:15.246 --> 15:16.481
That's more like it.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.687
So, Magnum,
what changed your mind?

15:20.586 --> 15:21.755
A garden snail.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.691
This is so great.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.831
Do you supply a gun or
should I bring my own?

15:42.494 --> 15:44.097
So that's Chester Bixby.

15:44.163 --> 15:45.666
In person.

15:45.731 --> 15:48.436
I wish he'd have stayed on Maui.
He ruined my trip.

15:48.501 --> 15:49.937
Yeah, but Rita,

15:50.403 --> 15:52.574
this makes our
investigation easier.

15:52.639 --> 15:54.376
Now, all we have
to do is be patient.

15:54.442 --> 15:56.579
It'll probably be
a long surveillance,

15:56.644 --> 16:00.318
but eventually, if we're lucky, we'll
catch him pulling a phony fall, see?

16:00.382 --> 16:02.887
Hey, you think
he's packing heat?

16:03.652 --> 16:06.157
No, I don't think so,
some Bengay, maybe.

16:08.024 --> 16:10.462
Yeah, there he is.
Yeah, I thought so.

16:10.527 --> 16:12.063
He's down by the dairy products.

16:12.129 --> 16:14.968
He'll probably spill something on the
floor and pretend to slip in it.

16:15.032 --> 16:17.737
That makes the store more liable.
Poor maintenance.

16:18.236 --> 16:20.440
Can I get a price check
on seven, please?

16:23.209 --> 16:26.448
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. They're
having this special on water chestnuts.

16:26.511 --> 16:28.014
It's my favorites.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.716
You like Chinese food?
I love it.

16:29.782 --> 16:33.690
You know, I grew up down the street from
the only Chinese restaurant in Olathe.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.390
Olathe?

16:35.756 --> 16:37.059
Kansas? You're from Kansas?

16:37.125 --> 16:38.193
Yeah.

16:38.259 --> 16:40.464
Me and Dorothy and Toto, too.

16:40.528 --> 16:44.269
Yeah, I was the skinniest, buck-toothed
kid from the wrong side of the tracks

16:44.333 --> 16:47.473
until I hit about
fifteen or so, and then...

16:47.536 --> 16:50.676
Then, guys wanted to do things
for me, buy things for me.

16:51.408 --> 16:52.744
Yeah, I can imagine.

16:52.809 --> 16:56.249
Uh, you didn't meet,
uh, Joe in Olathe?

16:56.314 --> 16:57.817
No, Kansas City.

16:58.549 --> 17:01.221
You see, I was a cocktail
waitress at a private club.

17:01.286 --> 17:04.290
One night, these two city officials
came in, they were drunk.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.964
They started hassling me, and Joe shows
up, like, right out of the blue.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.066
And he threatened to bust their
heads open and then get them fired.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.635
'Cause you know what, he had
the mayor's home phone number.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.002
I couldn't believe it.

17:15.069 --> 17:16.405
Your knight in
shining armor, huh?

17:16.471 --> 17:17.973
Yeah, I guess so.

17:23.011 --> 17:24.146
You like oranges?

17:24.579 --> 17:25.646
Uh-huh.

17:25.714 --> 17:26.817
I love oranges.

17:26.883 --> 17:28.252
I'm gonna grab us a couple.

17:28.918 --> 17:30.020
Let me see.

17:30.454 --> 17:33.994
You know, I don't know why they have
to put the good ones on the bottom.

17:34.057 --> 17:35.159
No!

17:38.830 --> 17:41.302
You can't fool around on
a surveillance mission.

17:41.367 --> 17:45.041
If you draw attention to yourself,
the whole assignment is over,

17:46.105 --> 17:47.106
understand?

17:56.384 --> 17:59.156
Sixty-two dollars worth
of bruised oranges.

17:59.220 --> 18:01.224
Oh, just put it on
your expense report.

18:01.290 --> 18:03.327
Joe expects me to
do things like this.

18:03.392 --> 18:06.699
I'm always wrecking cars,
I drop vases, spill oranges.

18:06.762 --> 18:09.234
It's not just that, Rita.
We blew our surveillance.

18:09.299 --> 18:10.568
Bixby's long gone.

18:10.633 --> 18:14.007
All we can do now is go back and hang
around his hotel till he shows up.

18:14.071 --> 18:15.239
There he is! What?

18:18.443 --> 18:19.645
No kidding.

18:21.212 --> 18:22.682
This must be our lucky day.

18:25.784 --> 18:27.087
Oh, my God!

18:30.923 --> 18:32.894
Oh, my God! He's hit! He's dead!

18:32.960 --> 18:34.897
No, he's not. This is his scam.
Come on.

18:34.962 --> 18:36.365
Are you trying to say
he did that on purpose?

18:36.431 --> 18:38.101
Yeah! He picks out
an expensive car,

18:38.166 --> 18:39.468
he does a stuntman's
roll over the hood,

18:39.534 --> 18:40.603
and he'll sue the driver blind.

18:40.668 --> 18:42.805
He's hurt. Don't
worry, he's fine.

18:42.870 --> 18:44.139
He's dead.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.276
Somebody call the police.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.180
Oh.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.990
Uh, come on, let's
go back to the car.

18:58.055 --> 19:00.760
No, no. I got to get
used to stuff like this.

19:00.825 --> 19:02.930
We got a iob to do. What job?

19:02.995 --> 19:04.965
We got to search
that body for clues.

19:05.030 --> 19:06.031
Rita...

19:06.098 --> 19:07.936
You know, like...
Like a matchbook,

19:08.001 --> 19:10.405
or a little piece of paper
with a phone number on it,

19:10.470 --> 19:13.276
or a little black book,
you know, clues.

19:13.340 --> 19:16.647
Rita, this is a major felony.
The police are coming.

19:16.710 --> 19:19.014
How could anybody
possibly search this body

19:19.080 --> 19:21.451
for clues in front of
all these witnesses?

19:21.516 --> 19:24.256
Chester! Oh, baby!

19:24.320 --> 19:28.662
Chester! Oh, my God,
Chester, baby!

19:28.724 --> 19:31.296
Excuse me, uh,
I'm a friend of the family.

19:31.361 --> 19:33.565
No, that's okay,
Phoebe, come on.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.300
Come on, Phoebe.
No, it's all right.

19:35.366 --> 19:37.971
It's fine, come on.
Come on. No, don't do that.

19:38.036 --> 19:41.008
Come on, have a good cry,
that's all right, there we go.

19:41.072 --> 19:45.147
What are you doing and what did
you take out of his pocket?

19:45.210 --> 19:46.880
Pretty slick, huh?

19:46.945 --> 19:48.548
No, you're tampering
with evidence.

19:48.615 --> 19:50.218
You're gonna get
us both arrested.

19:50.283 --> 19:51.719
Okay, fine. I'll put it back.

19:51.785 --> 19:54.357
No, wait. Never mind. Let's go.

19:54.422 --> 19:56.325
Right, it's the
Sunset Harbor Club.

19:56.390 --> 19:57.625
No, we're going to your hotel.

19:57.692 --> 20:01.800
Now, listen, Rita, the case is over,
it's lying back there on the road.

20:01.862 --> 20:05.202
But he just got murdered, or
manslaughtered or something.

20:05.267 --> 20:07.070
Well, uh, that's
a police matter.

20:07.136 --> 20:10.776
I was hired to stop him from filing
a false lawsuit. That's all.

20:10.873 --> 20:15.048
I cannot believe that a hot shot P.l.
like you is gonna wimp out on me.

20:15.345 --> 20:16.480
I'm not wimping out.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.387
I'm behaving like a professional
private investigator.

20:19.451 --> 20:21.856
If you wanna quit, fine, quit.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.492
I will continue the
investigation on my own.

20:24.856 --> 20:25.857
Taxi!

20:26.559 --> 20:27.661
Rita.

20:29.128 --> 20:30.731
You're being silly about this.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.235
I'm not gonna run after you.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.435
I mean it!

20:41.410 --> 20:44.382
Enthusiasm can be
a very attractive quality.

20:44.446 --> 20:46.684
But Rita had too
much of a good thing.

20:46.749 --> 20:50.256
She reminded me of Minnie
Minoso playing baseball.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.257
Once while trying to
make a diving catch,

20:52.322 --> 20:56.397
he slid head first into the outfield
wall and fractured his skull.

20:56.460 --> 20:59.232
But not that Rita was in
any kind of physical danger.

20:59.296 --> 21:01.367
The chances of her
making any contact

21:01.433 --> 21:05.875
with authentic criminal types
were microscopic, infinitesimal.

21:23.826 --> 21:26.899
You came! I knew it, I knew you
wouldn't desert me, I knew it.

21:26.962 --> 21:30.703
Shh. Okay, now remember, I'm
just doing this to humor you.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.370
A professional private
investigator would never

21:32.435 --> 21:34.205
waste his time on a long
shot like this, here.

21:34.271 --> 21:35.271
What's this?

21:35.305 --> 21:37.410
That's the surveillance
photos of Bixby.

21:37.475 --> 21:39.478
I mean, if you're gonna ask
questions about somebody,

21:39.544 --> 21:41.916
you got to learn to do it right.
No half measures.

21:41.979 --> 21:43.349
I'll remember that.

21:43.415 --> 21:44.817
Welcome, what can I get you?

21:44.882 --> 21:46.552
Uh, Old Dusseldorf
in a long neck.

21:46.619 --> 21:47.620
Coming right up.

21:47.687 --> 21:51.261
Say, you've brightened up this young lady.
What's your secret?

21:51.324 --> 21:53.428
It's simple. We're on
our honeymoon!

21:53.494 --> 21:57.134
No wonder. Congratulations.
This round's on me.

21:57.464 --> 21:59.502
Say, you're a lucky guy
to grab a looker like this.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.170
Bet she can cook, too.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.206
Oh, she's full of surprises.

22:04.774 --> 22:05.842
What are you doing?

22:05.907 --> 22:09.849
Look, this may be the only time in
my life I get to go under cover.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.281
I want to play a role.

22:11.848 --> 22:12.950
Besides,

22:13.015 --> 22:15.320
is being married to
me so unbelievable?

22:16.520 --> 22:17.789
No, no. Never mind.

22:17.855 --> 22:19.558
Just take this photo, uh...

22:19.624 --> 22:23.264
This one of Bixby, and ask
if anybody recognizes him.

22:24.663 --> 22:27.936
And remember, never lie unless
you absolutely have to.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.168
Never lie.

22:29.703 --> 22:30.938
Cheers. Hi.

22:31.003 --> 22:33.208
My cousin lives
in the neighborhood.

22:33.273 --> 22:36.880
I hear he comes in here a lot. His name's
Chester or Chet. You recognize him?

22:38.512 --> 22:40.048
He doesn't look familiar.

22:40.448 --> 22:41.818
, Hmm, well

22:43.218 --> 22:45.555
I guess I got my
neighborhoods confused.

22:50.460 --> 22:52.665
Two Mai Tais
and a scotch and soda.

22:58.903 --> 23:00.606
Like I said, a complete
waste of time.

23:00.672 --> 23:02.609
Yes, this is definitely the guy.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.477
Four nights ago,
he fell in the men's room,

23:04.542 --> 23:06.513
claimed there was dried
soap on the floor.

23:06.579 --> 23:08.951
Said he was gonna sue,
made a big fuss.

23:09.015 --> 23:10.818
And the employees
here now saw that?

23:10.884 --> 23:12.954
Most of them. I'll tell
you something else,

23:13.019 --> 23:14.455
that guy was lying.

23:14.521 --> 23:17.426
When I scrub a floor, there's
no damn soap left on it!

23:17.491 --> 23:19.863
No, I'm sure there's not.
Thanks a lot, uh...

23:19.927 --> 23:20.996
Martha.

23:22.965 --> 23:25.303
So long shots
sometimes do pay off.

23:25.367 --> 23:26.869
Well, that's unbelievable.

23:26.935 --> 23:28.605
It's completely unbelievable.

23:29.338 --> 23:30.908
Of course, all it
really proves is that.

23:30.974 --> 23:33.847
Bixby's trying to pull a scam
on other people here in Hawaii.

23:33.944 --> 23:36.114
But it would definitely
help our case.

23:36.179 --> 23:37.949
If we had a case,
which we don't.

23:38.449 --> 23:39.952
We're making up a neW One.

23:40.484 --> 23:43.724
Why are all these people lying
about recognizing Bixby?

23:45.390 --> 23:48.830
Maybe the owner told everybody to
shut up because of the lawsuit.

23:49.362 --> 23:51.432
No, no. Uh-uh.

23:51.497 --> 23:53.702
I'm not getting sucked into this.
Come on, let's go.

23:53.767 --> 23:54.969
Come on. No way.

23:57.604 --> 23:58.672
Martha.

23:59.206 --> 24:01.176
One more question.
Who owns this place?

24:01.241 --> 24:04.816
Officially, a company
called CBE Enterprises.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.650
But the rumor is...

24:09.785 --> 24:11.188
A boxer?

24:11.253 --> 24:13.256
No, a mobster.

24:21.931 --> 24:24.001
We're awfully late,
Rita, and from what I've seen,

24:24.067 --> 24:25.837
I'd bet Joe has
a real Irish temper.

24:25.902 --> 24:27.305
Yeah, but I can handle him.

24:27.371 --> 24:30.578
I'm just saying that you should be
prepared for the possibility that

24:30.642 --> 24:33.347
Joe might, well...
Who knows what he might do?

24:33.411 --> 24:37.720
Don't be silly. All I have to do is be
perky. Joe loves it when I am perky.

24:41.420 --> 24:42.589
Where the hell have you been?

24:42.656 --> 24:43.758
Joe, I had the best time.

24:43.823 --> 24:47.230
And I had dinner reservations
45 minutes ago! I'm starving!

24:47.294 --> 24:48.830
I'm sorry, Joe.

24:48.895 --> 24:52.235
Look, I took Rita to the other
side of the island, and

24:52.300 --> 24:54.203
we got involved. In something.

24:54.268 --> 24:57.575
A crime, Joe! There was this
crook, got hit by a car,

24:57.639 --> 25:01.381
I found a clue, and then I found
a witness, there were police...

25:01.444 --> 25:03.982
Clam up, will you? I don't
care about none of that.

25:04.047 --> 25:06.619
I care about your being
here when I say so.

25:06.684 --> 25:08.821
Or I ain't footing
the bill for this.

25:09.954 --> 25:11.557
I understand, Joe,

25:11.623 --> 25:13.960
and you're right, but it's
my fault Rita's late.

25:14.593 --> 25:16.731
She drove you nuts, huh?

25:16.795 --> 25:18.698
What'd she do?
Blow the whole case?

25:18.764 --> 25:19.866
No, I didn't.

25:20.500 --> 25:23.707
Nobody's talking to you. Can't you see
the guy's begging to be rid of you?

25:23.770 --> 25:27.812
Now, wait a minute,
Joe, that's not strictly true.

25:27.875 --> 25:29.678
Rita was very helpful.

25:29.743 --> 25:32.148
Call it luck, call it
good fortune, but, uh...

25:32.880 --> 25:35.886
The point is she had a knack for
making the right move today.

25:37.052 --> 25:38.922
Wait, wait a minute.

25:39.722 --> 25:42.428
Are you saying you want her
to stay on the case with you?

25:45.795 --> 25:46.998
Well, yes, I do.

25:47.598 --> 25:50.603
Not that it's gonna be
as easy as it was today, Rita.

25:50.668 --> 25:52.004
Don't worry, coach.

25:52.070 --> 25:54.542
When you're hot, you're hot.

26:03.516 --> 26:06.054
Are you saying you've been squiring
this young woman around town

26:06.119 --> 26:07.722
instead of working on my case?

26:07.787 --> 26:08.788
Your case?

26:09.190 --> 26:11.562
Your case, Higgins?
Not Robin Masters' case?

26:11.626 --> 26:12.627
What're you writing there?

26:12.694 --> 26:15.499
Stop trying to distract me
from your malfeasance.

26:15.564 --> 26:19.472
You can't be doing a proper investigative
job if you're entertaining some woman.

26:19.535 --> 26:22.407
Oh, but I can, Higgins.
In fact, your case is settled.

26:22.472 --> 26:25.445
Now, isn't this the next great
Robin Masters masterpiece?

26:28.178 --> 26:30.215
What do you mean the case is settled?
Already?

26:30.280 --> 26:32.451
Absolutely. I can guarantee you

26:32.517 --> 26:36.792
that Chester Bixby will not pursue his
lawsuit against you or the estate.

26:37.289 --> 26:38.290
Why not?

26:38.357 --> 26:40.762
He's dead. He was run over
by a car this morning.

26:43.530 --> 26:46.402
Well, Magnum, I must say, while
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

26:46.466 --> 26:49.372
having him sign a release would
have been quite sufficient.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.342
Ha.

26:53.407 --> 26:55.411
That's a lot of garbage.

26:55.477 --> 26:59.919
Ten square miles of it. And
I've hovered over every inch.

26:59.982 --> 27:01.485
Talk about smell.

27:01.551 --> 27:03.554
Hey. How high up can
you smell it?

27:03.620 --> 27:05.256
What? 1,OOO feet? 5,OOO feet?

27:05.321 --> 27:06.824
What difference does that make?

27:06.890 --> 27:09.362
Well, you know, guys bet
on weird things sometimes.

27:10.461 --> 27:12.364
A little inside info can't hurt.

27:14.232 --> 27:16.703
So, what do you think
about Joe Hatten, T.C.?

27:18.270 --> 27:19.439
He's okay.

27:19.871 --> 27:22.343
Kind of a loudmouth, likes to
talk about how much he's made

27:22.408 --> 27:24.813
and how well-connected
he is on the mainland.

27:26.313 --> 27:29.352
But I think you're having a much better
time with his young lady friend.

27:30.317 --> 27:32.388
Let me guess,
she's gorgeous, right?

27:32.453 --> 27:34.323
And friendly. Whoo!

27:34.389 --> 27:36.192
All right, now,
hold it right there.

27:36.257 --> 27:38.929
Rita is a client. We have a
purely professional relationship.

27:38.993 --> 27:40.393
Kind of like a
doctor and a patient.

27:40.729 --> 27:41.765
Right.

27:41.831 --> 27:44.970
"Come into my office, my dear, and
disrobe, and we'll discuss the case."

27:45.034 --> 27:47.539
That is...
That is not what I meant.

27:47.604 --> 27:52.281
I mean, she's a sweet girl but she's
a little too intense for my taste.

27:52.343 --> 27:54.748
You know, I had to lie about having
an emergency dental appointment

27:54.813 --> 27:56.383
just to get this little break.

27:57.082 --> 27:59.386
Oh, I'd better go if I want
to get in a round of golf.

27:59.451 --> 28:01.856
Besides, Joe might want
to go up this afternoon.

28:02.689 --> 28:03.925
See you. All right.

28:05.058 --> 28:08.130
That's not fair, Rick. A client's a client.
Period. So...

28:08.862 --> 28:10.131
Could you... l need...

28:11.966 --> 28:13.769
Go ahead. No, no,
no, you go first.

28:14.669 --> 28:15.670
All right.

28:16.171 --> 28:19.578
Look, Thomas, I need a favor, but you got
to promise me it's gonna be a secret.

28:19.642 --> 28:21.112
And what's the problem?

28:23.112 --> 28:24.280
Bugs.

28:25.248 --> 28:29.056
I found one the size of a St. Bernard
crawling across my face this morning.

28:29.119 --> 28:30.254
Yeah?

28:30.320 --> 28:34.595
Thomas, do you remember when you borrowed
that fumigation equipment to go undercover?

28:34.659 --> 28:36.262
You knew what you were
doing with that stuff, right?

28:36.327 --> 28:40.904
Well, sure, but why don't you just
hire a professional exterminator?

28:40.966 --> 28:42.669
What, are you kidding? Don't
you know what those guys do?

28:42.736 --> 28:45.241
They come in your house and they spray
a bunch of phony insecticide around,

28:45.305 --> 28:48.144
then they plant a whole bunch
of new bugs all over the place.

28:48.208 --> 28:51.080
Rick, why would they do that?

28:51.145 --> 28:53.315
Because they tell you
you have infestation

28:53.381 --> 28:55.552
and that it's gonna take years
of treatment to get rid of it

28:55.617 --> 28:57.454
and mucho loot.

28:57.519 --> 29:00.826
Come on, admit it, it's not
the money, it's the bugs!

29:01.391 --> 29:04.130
Well, uh, either way,
I mean... Hey, look,

29:04.761 --> 29:07.901
you're the only one I trust. You
got to do this for me, Thomas.

29:08.766 --> 29:09.934
Oh, boy.

29:10.902 --> 29:12.939
That's a pretty
messy job, and I'm...

29:13.003 --> 29:17.011
Oh, boy, I'm really
very busy. I got it.

29:18.076 --> 29:22.685
I might be able to squeeze it in if you could
check out a company named CBE Enterprises.

29:23.516 --> 29:26.188
I'm taking off like a toupee in a
hurricane. How soon can you spray?

29:26.252 --> 29:27.355
How about later today?

29:27.421 --> 29:29.141
Oh, looks like you
got them here, too, look!

29:30.758 --> 29:32.060
Thomas!

29:34.162 --> 29:37.669
Do you really think the Sunset
Harbor Club is owned by mobsters?

29:37.733 --> 29:40.973
Well, Martha thinks so, and Rick
should be able to tell us for sure.

29:44.574 --> 29:45.575
Trust me.

29:45.642 --> 29:48.214
Don't you think approaching him
like this is a little weird?

29:48.278 --> 29:50.483
No. It'll be great.
He'll love it.

29:50.548 --> 29:52.585
See, Rick is really
afraid of bugs,

29:52.650 --> 29:55.255
and everybody knows that
fear makes things funnier.

29:55.319 --> 29:56.388
You just wait.

29:57.522 --> 29:59.292
This'll be a scream.

29:59.358 --> 30:01.563
Come on, Rick, where'd you go?

30:01.627 --> 30:03.330
Oh, my God! What?

30:03.396 --> 30:05.834
I just realized why he's
not answering the door.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.004
The mobsters must've found
out we were onto them,

30:09.068 --> 30:12.141
and they came here to shut Rick up.
He's dead!

30:12.206 --> 30:13.374
That's ridiculous.

30:13.975 --> 30:15.545
He's probably out by the pool.

30:16.211 --> 30:17.346
Yeah?

30:18.446 --> 30:20.116
You said Bixby was alive, too.

30:20.181 --> 30:23.021
I'm telling you, Rita,
he's not dead!

30:26.623 --> 30:27.891
Rick!

30:30.594 --> 30:32.064
Rick!

30:32.129 --> 30:34.834
Hey, hey, what's going on?
Get away from me!

30:38.236 --> 30:39.772
Help! Jeez! What?

30:39.838 --> 30:40.941
Rick, Rick, it's me, Thomas!

30:41.007 --> 30:43.444
What are you? Some kind of nut?
What're you trying to do, Thomas?

30:43.510 --> 30:45.513
Save your life! You idiot!

30:52.720 --> 30:55.726
It was just meant to be a little
joke, that's all. It snowballed.

30:55.791 --> 30:56.993
I told him it was weird.

30:58.126 --> 30:59.127
Weird, huh?

31:01.597 --> 31:03.200
Sick is more like it.

31:03.266 --> 31:04.401
Oh, sure.

31:04.467 --> 31:08.074
But it's perfectly normal to float
face down in a swimming pool.

31:08.137 --> 31:09.840
I had a date last
night, damn it!

31:09.907 --> 31:12.212
We went for a moonlight swim, and she
lost a charm off of her necklace,

31:12.276 --> 31:13.679
and I was trying
to find it, okay?

31:13.745 --> 31:14.847
Fine, fine.

31:14.913 --> 31:17.385
A moonlight swim, see,
that's really romantic.

31:17.449 --> 31:18.919
Did you go skinny dipping?

31:20.753 --> 31:22.590
What about CBE Enterprises?

31:22.655 --> 31:24.659
Why should I tell you
anything that I learned?

31:24.724 --> 31:27.863
Rick, Thomas iumped in
to save you because he cared.

31:27.928 --> 31:29.031
Yeah.

31:29.463 --> 31:32.035
Well, your source was right.

31:32.733 --> 31:37.442
The real owner of CBE and the
Sunset Harbor Club is Serge Burgos.

31:38.740 --> 31:40.143
Serge Burgos?

31:41.410 --> 31:43.347
Wait a minute, is this a
payback for the bug mask?

31:43.412 --> 31:46.752
Hey, Thomas, I don't kid around
about members of organized crime.

31:46.816 --> 31:49.254
And all my sources
gave me the same advice.

31:49.319 --> 31:52.526
Stay away from this guy because he
kills people for the fun of it.

31:54.291 --> 31:56.061
So, what's next?

31:59.131 --> 32:02.471
I think it's very unprofessional of
you to stop our investigation early.

32:02.535 --> 32:04.238
Rita, you heard what Rick said,

32:04.303 --> 32:07.242
Serge Burgos is a career
criminal, a mobster.

32:07.306 --> 32:09.644
See, that's all the more reason
that he should be caught.

32:09.710 --> 32:12.348
Well, not by us.
By the police, maybe.

32:12.947 --> 32:16.654
What are we gonna tell them? We don't even
know why Burgos killed Chester Bixby.

32:16.718 --> 32:19.190
Yes, we do. We do, maybe.

32:19.254 --> 32:23.363
I think Burgos is using the Sunset Harbor
Club for some sort of illegal activity,

32:23.425 --> 32:27.600
drug distribution, probably, and that's why
he doesn't want to reveal his ownership.

32:27.664 --> 32:29.067
What's this have
to do with Bixby?

32:29.133 --> 32:32.038
Bixby took the phony fall at the club.
He threatened to sue.

32:32.103 --> 32:34.308
The courts would've found out
that Burgos was the owner,

32:34.372 --> 32:35.507
SO...

32:35.573 --> 32:37.009
So he killed him for that?

32:37.075 --> 32:40.080
Because he happened to pull his
little scam in the wrong men's room?

32:40.879 --> 32:43.251
Gee, this guy plays rough.

32:43.315 --> 32:45.252
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

32:45.952 --> 32:47.121
It's over.

32:47.487 --> 32:48.655
End of lesson.

32:49.156 --> 32:51.327
Okay, okay, okay.

32:53.929 --> 32:56.701
Would you just do
one more favor for me?

32:58.033 --> 32:59.035
What, Rita?

33:00.569 --> 33:02.440
Tell me the truth, Thomas.

33:02.505 --> 33:04.408
You're not really
giving up on this case,

33:04.473 --> 33:06.410
you're just saying
that to get rid of me.

33:06.475 --> 33:07.945
That's not true.

33:08.011 --> 33:11.318
I mean, these last two days have
been the most thrilling of my life.

33:11.381 --> 33:13.318
And it's not just because
of the detective work.

33:13.383 --> 33:15.220
It's because of being with you.

33:15.285 --> 33:16.688
Well, that's nice of you...

33:18.556 --> 33:19.892
Rita!

33:21.126 --> 33:22.429
What the hell is this?

33:22.494 --> 33:24.264
Joe, it's not what
it looks like.

33:24.330 --> 33:25.398
Oh, it's not?

33:25.464 --> 33:28.504
Well, it looks like you're
trying to inhale my fiancÃ©.

33:28.568 --> 33:30.940
Oh, please, Joe, please,
it was just a little kiss.

33:31.005 --> 33:32.273
Don't make a federal case...

33:32.339 --> 33:34.811
I'll make any damn
thing I want out of it!

33:34.875 --> 33:37.580
I know a lot of big people
in this town, Magnum.

33:37.646 --> 33:39.983
People who could give
you major problems.

33:40.048 --> 33:41.785
And of course,
there's Bart here.

33:42.384 --> 33:44.387
There's nothing going
on between Rita and me.

33:44.453 --> 33:46.858
You got that right,
'cause you're out of here.

33:46.923 --> 33:48.126
You're fired.

33:48.192 --> 33:50.429
Joe, no! No that... It's okay.

33:51.061 --> 33:53.065
It's really the best
solution, believe me.

33:53.131 --> 33:54.767
Thomas... I'm sorry, Joe.

33:55.934 --> 33:56.969
Bye, Rita.

34:05.411 --> 34:06.847
I know what you're thinking.

34:06.913 --> 34:11.489
If I had planned just to tell the police
my suspicions and forget about this case,

34:11.551 --> 34:15.493
why was I wasting the day watching
Serge Burgos cultivate skin cancer?

34:15.556 --> 34:16.724
I'll tell you why.

34:16.791 --> 34:18.194
Don Wagner.

34:18.260 --> 34:23.471
When I was thirteen years old, I played
Don Wagner in the city tennis tournament.

34:23.532 --> 34:25.335
He took private lessons
at the country club,

34:25.400 --> 34:27.539
and I just picked up
the game in the park.

34:27.603 --> 34:29.174
He made fun of my ground strokes

34:29.239 --> 34:32.179
while we were warming up, and
I knew I had to beat him.

34:33.678 --> 34:38.554
So, I ran and dived and deked and made
impossibly lucky shots until I won.

34:40.719 --> 34:45.596
Last night I realized I'd become the
Don Wagner of private investigators.

34:45.658 --> 34:47.527
Smug, complacent.

34:47.592 --> 34:49.429
Rita was running and diving

34:49.495 --> 34:52.601
and making impossibly lucky
connections to build this case.

34:52.666 --> 34:54.503
I needed to get back
on her side of the net,

34:54.568 --> 34:56.873
to try to close
out the set for her.

34:56.938 --> 35:00.578
Of course, the ideal thing would be to
connect Burgos to the hit-and-run car,

35:00.642 --> 35:02.613
but I knew that was
pretty fa_etched.

35:27.440 --> 35:30.546
So, I was probably wasting
my time on a long shot,

35:30.610 --> 35:33.048
but Rita deserved a couple
of days of my time.

35:33.814 --> 35:36.452
Besides, her long
shots usually hit.

36:22.871 --> 36:23.872
Rick!

36:26.676 --> 36:27.711
What are you doing here?

36:27.777 --> 36:30.282
You're gonna owe me two more
fumigations for this little favor.

36:30.347 --> 36:31.582
What?

36:31.648 --> 36:33.519
What do you think, it's easy to
get good body mike equipment

36:33.584 --> 36:34.786
at such short notice?

36:34.852 --> 36:35.853
Body mike?

36:35.920 --> 36:38.091
Very smart of you to have
Rita talk me into it.

36:38.156 --> 36:41.128
At least you could have told me that her
boyfriend was that mobster's buddy.

36:41.194 --> 36:43.097
Thomas, I might have said
something in front of her.

36:43.162 --> 36:44.464
Joe and Burgos are friends?

36:44.529 --> 36:45.565
I know that now.

36:45.631 --> 36:48.711
But I'm not so sure I should have let her
wear that wire to dinner with Burgos.

36:48.734 --> 36:50.404
She's wearing a wire? Right now?

36:50.470 --> 36:51.739
I do nice work, I mean...

36:51.805 --> 36:54.510
Of all the stupid... You
should have asked me first!

36:56.543 --> 36:58.648
Well, you might have
said you're welcome!

37:09.791 --> 37:12.029
<i>There's one major drawback
to running and diving</i>

37:12.094 --> 37:14.933
<i>and going full tilt at
a criminal investigation.</i>

37:15.832 --> 37:17.870
<i>Sometimes the thrill
of the chase</i>

37:17.935 --> 37:20.974
<i>leads to a reckless disregard
for your own welfare.</i>

37:21.038 --> 37:22.474
<i>Partly because of me,</i>

37:22.539 --> 37:24.209
<i>Rita was crossing that line.</i>

37:27.479 --> 37:29.216
Here's our table,
right over here.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.350
Hold it, Joe.
Where's your couth?

37:31.416 --> 37:33.554
It's supposed to be
boy-girl-boy-girl.

37:37.323 --> 37:39.695
And this city
councilman was crucifying me

37:39.760 --> 37:42.800
because he said my trucks made too
much noise in the early morning.

37:42.864 --> 37:44.199
So, what did you do?

37:44.264 --> 37:46.769
That night I dumped six
truckloads on his front lawn,

37:46.834 --> 37:48.838
and he slept through
it like a baby.

37:53.642 --> 37:57.016
Joe, I want to hear everything Mr.
Burgos has to say.

38:12.999 --> 38:15.838
Joe tells me you own
some real estate, Mr. Burgos.

38:15.902 --> 38:17.405
Do you own any nightclubs?

38:17.470 --> 38:18.471
No.

38:18.939 --> 38:20.676
Shopping centers, mainly.

38:20.741 --> 38:21.742
Why do you ask?

38:22.242 --> 38:25.247
Oh, no reason. I like nightclubs.
I think they're fun.

38:25.312 --> 38:26.347
Hey!

38:26.413 --> 38:27.649
No, excuse me, EXCUSE Me.

38:27.715 --> 38:29.017
What're you doing here?

38:29.084 --> 38:30.821
I don't mean to
interrupt your dinner,

38:30.886 --> 38:33.558
I just need to speak
to Rita for just a minute.

38:33.622 --> 38:34.623
About what?

38:36.960 --> 38:40.132
About that surprise that
I was arranging for Joe.

38:40.197 --> 38:43.036
Oh, that. Well, um,
I cancelled that.

38:43.100 --> 38:44.101
I thought of something else.

38:44.167 --> 38:46.438
Uh, that's not a very
wise decision, Rita.

38:47.371 --> 38:49.341
You heard her,
Magnum, clear out.

38:49.875 --> 38:51.912
I really think you
should reconsider, Rita.

38:52.945 --> 38:55.083
All right, uh,
you've had your say.

38:55.148 --> 38:57.720
Please leave quietly,
or I'll have you removed.

39:06.895 --> 39:08.197
What's his story?

39:08.262 --> 39:12.771
Name's Magnum. Just some bozo P.l.
I hired to entertain Rita.

39:12.835 --> 39:14.404
That's private investigator.

39:14.469 --> 39:15.672
A P.l, huh?

39:15.738 --> 39:17.675
You sure that was a good idea?

39:17.740 --> 39:19.443
I'm sure it was a terrible idea.

39:20.143 --> 39:22.180
He takes her on this
simple little tail job,

39:22.246 --> 39:25.552
and the guy they're shadowing gets
run down at some shopping center.

39:25.616 --> 39:29.124
Yeah, poor old Mr. Johnson,
and 84 years old.

39:29.188 --> 39:31.793
What're you babbling about?
He was younger than that.

39:31.857 --> 39:34.896
Name was Pixley or Benchley,
something like that.

39:35.528 --> 39:39.035
You know, I just realized
I do have to talk to Thomas.

39:39.099 --> 39:40.469
Like hell you do!

39:40.534 --> 39:42.638
Joe, let go of me
or I'll drown you.

39:43.871 --> 39:46.075
You're a real bimbo,
you know that?

40:00.523 --> 40:02.493
Thomas, Joe told Burgos
about the case!

40:02.560 --> 40:03.962
I heard. Let's go!

40:11.903 --> 40:14.008
They have to be taken care of.
Both of them.

40:14.073 --> 40:15.576
Hey, it's out of my hands!

40:32.560 --> 40:33.663
This is great!

40:35.364 --> 40:38.436
Well, come on, let's shoot back.
Where's your gun?

40:38.500 --> 40:39.736
Where's yours?

40:39.803 --> 40:43.443
Yeah, right. A concealed weapon in
this dress? You've got to be kidding!

40:44.075 --> 40:45.110
Where is it?

40:45.176 --> 40:46.345
At the Estate.

40:55.454 --> 40:56.857
No gun?

40:56.923 --> 40:58.693
A detective with no gun?

40:58.758 --> 41:00.294
It's private investigator!

41:48.516 --> 41:50.152
Come on, find them! Find them!

42:43.280 --> 42:44.382
Rita!

42:45.349 --> 42:46.719
Rita! Jump!

42:46.784 --> 42:50.658
I ain't talking to you, Joe Hatten,
till you take back calling me a bimbo.

42:50.722 --> 42:52.224
He didn't mean it!

42:52.290 --> 42:53.526
Rita, jump!

42:55.694 --> 42:58.700
All right, I'm sorry I called you a bimbo.
Jump, damn it!

42:59.132 --> 43:01.437
Oh, that truck's
full of garbage.

43:03.469 --> 43:05.039
Rita, they got guns.

43:07.041 --> 43:08.209
Let's go!

43:11.913 --> 43:13.216
Go!

43:28.332 --> 43:30.637
It's the same song
whenever I come to a new city.

43:31.103 --> 43:33.140
There's always
a guy like Burgos.

43:33.205 --> 43:35.376
I have to wine and dine him,
and then pay him off

43:35.441 --> 43:38.313
so I don't have trouble with
my equipment or the unions.

43:38.378 --> 43:40.449
It's outrageous to have
to deal with such men.

43:40.513 --> 43:42.082
Hey, that's the business.

43:42.449 --> 43:45.555
But I did sort of enioy seeing
Burgos draw some hard time.

43:46.754 --> 43:50.829
You know, Higgins, Magnum's got
himself one sweet layout here.

43:50.892 --> 43:52.795
You must enioy working for him.

43:55.965 --> 43:57.534
It's an experience.

43:58.634 --> 44:01.172
As you can see, Mr. Magnum
takes an inordinate

44:01.238 --> 44:05.614
pride in his dedication
to the horticultural arts.

44:05.676 --> 44:06.878
Yeah.

44:07.212 --> 44:10.217
J If he ever wants to sell this'd
make a hell of a landfill.

44:21.328 --> 44:22.698
I think not.

44:26.534 --> 44:28.772
You know, Thomas,
before all this,

44:28.836 --> 44:32.510
the biggest accomplishment in my
life was carrying a tray of drinks

44:32.573 --> 44:36.315
across a bar while being propositioned
once and pinched three times.

44:37.313 --> 44:39.550
I wasn't half bad with this
detective stuff, was I?

44:39.616 --> 44:41.586
Oh, you were much
better than that.

44:41.651 --> 44:43.087
All you needed was

44:43.753 --> 44:45.323
a little push.

44:45.389 --> 44:48.295
I'm not gonna forget that.

44:48.360 --> 44:50.063
I'm not gonna forget any of it.

44:51.463 --> 44:55.305
You know, Thomas, you're the first
guy I ever met who treated me nice

44:56.535 --> 44:58.506
and didn't ask for
anything in return.

45:00.340 --> 45:01.341
Thank you.

45:03.644 --> 45:05.013
Rita!

45:06.414 --> 45:07.883
What do you think you're doing?

45:07.949 --> 45:10.286
Oh, Joe, I'm sorry.
It was just that I felt...

45:10.852 --> 45:13.959
Joe, you're treating me like a child again.
I'm a person.

45:14.023 --> 45:15.492
I'm an adult human being.

45:15.557 --> 45:16.760
Now, you want me
to stay with you,

45:16.825 --> 45:18.495
you start treating
me like an adult.

45:20.763 --> 45:24.338
Otherwise, I'm coming back here and I'm
gonna become partners with Thomas.

45:25.536 --> 45:26.972
She's right, Joe.

45:27.038 --> 45:29.810
We made quite a team.
Rita's got great potential.

45:31.143 --> 45:34.517
Don't give me that. Do I
look stupid or something?

45:37.250 --> 45:39.487
This next case should
be a good one, Rita.

45:39.552 --> 45:42.124
It seems our client
believes a famous author

45:42.188 --> 45:45.528
is having all his books
ghost-written by a family servant.
