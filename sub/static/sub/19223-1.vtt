00:13.081 --> 00:15.683
- Just moved here
for a new job.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.251
Really excited.

00:17.285 --> 00:19.187
How long have you lived
in Charm City?

00:19.220 --> 00:21.689
- Long enough to know
it sucks.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.258
- I don't know.
I like it.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.526
A little bigger
than where I grew up,

00:25.559 --> 00:26.794
but not that different.
- [evil laughter]

00:26.827 --> 00:30.264
[crashing]
- Except for that.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.400
- Citizens of Charm City,

00:32.433 --> 00:35.569
Feel the fire
of Jack-O-Lantern.

00:35.603 --> 00:38.572
[epic music]

00:38.606 --> 00:41.675
- Are you guys seeing this?

00:41.709 --> 00:44.812
[phone beeps]
- Siri, push my meeting an hour.

00:44.845 --> 00:49.650

[dings]
- I know what you're thinking.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.738
Yet another
superhero battle.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.273
[light music]

01:12.306 --> 01:13.841
Well, my name's Emily Locke

01:13.874 --> 01:17.645
and I grew up in what's known
as a fly-over state.

01:17.678 --> 01:20.281
Superheroes never
stopped there.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.715
They just flew over it.

01:21.749 --> 01:22.883
I didn't have any powers,

01:22.916 --> 01:25.586
so I did what everybody else
in my town did:

01:25.619 --> 01:28.622
finish school
and got a soul-crushing job.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.591
I felt unfulfilled.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.593
Until one day,
my dad reminded me

01:32.626 --> 01:35.629
that you don't need superpowers
to accomplish great things.

01:35.663 --> 01:38.532
- What you do,
in your own quiet way,

01:38.566 --> 01:41.802
can change people's lives
for the better.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.872
- Right then and there,
I decided to make a change:

01:44.905 --> 01:48.242
I got a job at a company that
helps regular people like us

01:48.276 --> 01:51.745
feel safer in a world where
this kind of stuff happens.

01:51.779 --> 01:55.216
And now I might not
even make it to my first day.

[car alarm chirps]

02:18.539 --> 02:21.642
Wow.
You don't see that every day.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.411
- Actually, you do.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.213
You see it every day.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.681
- I'm still gonna
take a photo.

- I'm sorry I'm late.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.455
You'll never believe
what happened to me.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.724
My train literally went
off the rails and the--

03:43.757 --> 03:46.960
- I'm gonna cut you off here
because I'm assuming you lived.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.762
Mr. Wayne is waiting for you.

03:48.796 --> 03:52.400
*

03:52.433 --> 03:54.302
- I just wanted
to thank you again

03:54.335 --> 03:55.869
for this opportunity,
Mr. Wayne.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.439
- Please, call me Van.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.741
Now, my cousin Bruce, he likes
to be called Mr. Wayne.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.344
I call him B-Dubs.
We're very close.

04:03.377 --> 04:04.812
And I just told him
about you.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.547
- You talked to Bruce Wayne
about me?

04:06.580 --> 04:09.950
- No, I texted him.
He's hard to reach.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.785
But...look at his reply.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.422
- "Stop using
my HBO GO password."

04:14.455 --> 04:15.689
- No, that...
[chuckles]

04:15.723 --> 04:17.425
What a joker.
That's classic B-Dubs.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.060
Look at the one right before it.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.394
- "Sounds good."

04:21.428 --> 04:25.366
- Bruce Wayne thinks you
"sounds good."

04:25.399 --> 04:27.034
Look, I'm not gonna
lie to you.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.603
Business at Wayne Security
is down,

04:29.637 --> 04:32.406
and I am looking to you,
as our new Director of R&D.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.007
to come up
with a big idea, all right?

04:34.041 --> 04:36.043
Something that I can show
to Bruce,

04:36.076 --> 04:38.379
and he'll be like,
"What?"

04:38.412 --> 04:41.315
And I'll be like,
"Yeah."

04:41.349 --> 04:43.384
- This is everything
I have ever wanted.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.753
I promise
I will not let you down.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.321
- I know you won't.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.557
There were more
experienced candidates,

04:49.590 --> 04:51.959
but you stood out.
You are a people person.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.794
Every one
of your references said

04:53.827 --> 04:54.862
you're a great motivator

04:54.895 --> 04:58.499
and you actually care
about the, uh...uh...the--

04:58.532 --> 05:00.334
- People?
- Yep!

05:00.368 --> 05:02.370
- I do, that's why
I wanted to work here.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.438
I want to help people.
- Love that.

05:04.472 --> 05:07.608
As long as it's help
plus kicking ass.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.477
Because you need to
whip this team into shape.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.745
They're very talented,
but they're just missing

05:11.779 --> 05:13.947
a you to motivate them.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.916
I'm more
of a big picture guy.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.885
Look at this picture.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.922
This picture's huge.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.692
- You know, I am no stranger
to adversity.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.561
My dad owned a flower shop,
and when it was struggling, I--

05:27.595 --> 05:30.598
- I'm dying to hear
the end of that story, but--

05:30.631 --> 05:34.468
ooh, look, it's--my assistant's,
uh, motioning to me.

05:34.502 --> 05:37.104
What is it?
Jackie, did you need something?

05:37.137 --> 05:39.039
- No.
- What do you want from me?

05:39.072 --> 05:40.073
- Nothing.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.942
- [mouthing words]

05:41.975 --> 05:43.944
You are the worst.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.546
[playful music]

05:45.579 --> 05:48.616
Uh, you said there's
a phone call for me?

05:48.649 --> 05:51.585
- [sighs] Bruce Wayne
is on the phone for you.

05:51.619 --> 05:54.054
- Bruce Wayne?
My cuz-bro.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.656
Oh, no.
[chuckles]

05:55.689 --> 05:58.058
- Come on.
Time to meet your team.

05:58.091 --> 06:01.495
[upbeat music]

06:01.529 --> 06:04.532
- I can't believe I'm actually
working for Bruce Wayne.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.735
- Dot dot dot's cousin.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.938
[quirky music]

06:10.971 --> 06:14.642
Teddy, this is Emily Locke,
your new boss.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.944
- Nice to meet you.
What do you do here?

06:16.977 --> 06:18.145
- I disrupt.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.680
I alter the structure
of expectations,

06:19.713 --> 06:21.782
make people see things
in new ways.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.552
For example,
what do you think this is?

06:24.585 --> 06:26.887
- A desk?
- But what if it wasn't?

06:26.920 --> 06:29.457
What if it was the opposite
of a desk?

06:29.490 --> 06:32.526
- I'm sorry, I'm still not
exactly sure what you do.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.595
- I'm the Chief Design Officer.

06:34.628 --> 06:35.896
- But what if you weren't?

06:35.929 --> 06:37.665
- Wait, are you firing me?
Is she firing me?

06:37.698 --> 06:39.600
- No, no.
I was just making a joke.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.168
- Good one.
Good one.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.703
*

06:42.736 --> 06:44.505
[exhales deeply]
All right, come on.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.039
Let me show you around.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.175
*

06:48.208 --> 06:49.643
This is the lab.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.779
That's our 3-D printer.
Don't touch it.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.614
That's liquid nitrogen.
Don't touch it.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.783
That's Wendy,
our lead software engineer.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.184
- Let me guess,
don't touch her?

06:57.217 --> 06:58.686
- Why would you touch her?

06:58.719 --> 07:00.654
- Hey, guys.
Watch this.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.456
- That's Ron.
He's head of engineering

07:02.490 --> 07:04.592
and chief of
childlike wonder.

07:06.494 --> 07:09.530
- Batter up!

07:09.563 --> 07:12.733
[all chuckle]

07:12.766 --> 07:15.168
- That's amazing.
What is it?

07:15.202 --> 07:17.070
- It's called the Wear Bag.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.973
It protects against collateral
damage from superhero battles.

07:20.007 --> 07:23.811
We're talking about projectiles,
falling debris, direct blows.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.813
- [chuckles]

07:25.846 --> 07:28.115
- [groans]

07:28.148 --> 07:29.717
- It's only good for one use.

07:29.750 --> 07:30.718
- I know.

07:30.751 --> 07:31.952
That's for taking my muffin,
Steve.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.788
- Oh.
- That is an amazing product.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.224
- Right?
LexCorp makes it.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.592
- We're trying to figure out
how it works

07:38.626 --> 07:40.093
so we can make
a cheap knock-off.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.129
Welcome to Wayne Security.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.031
*

07:44.064 --> 07:48.001
- Let's...be...better.

07:50.203 --> 07:53.507
- That's a permanent marker.

07:53.541 --> 07:57.144
- Well, good, because that's
how I want us to be thinking.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.712
Permanently.

07:58.746 --> 08:01.048
Look, Wayne Security
has stopped innovating.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.984
Our follow up to last year's
Joker Venom Antidote

08:04.017 --> 08:07.521
is the exact same thing
in a slightly darker purple.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.089
- Mm, it's not slightly darker.

08:09.122 --> 08:12.960
Okay, one is amethyst
and one's sangria.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.595
You don't get it.
She doesn't get it.

08:14.628 --> 08:15.863
She's not getting it.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.230
- No,
I get that they're different.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.666
I just don't think
anyone cares

08:18.699 --> 08:20.601
about the color.
[all react]

08:20.634 --> 08:22.536
- Ooh, kitty's got claws.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.105
- Guys, we need to be
innovating.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.140
We need to push ourselves.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.742
We can't...

08:28.776 --> 08:32.279
just copy what LexCorp does.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.280
- Oh.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.283
- We need to...

08:36.316 --> 08:37.551
*

08:37.585 --> 08:38.719
Let's be better.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.253
And do you know how
we'll do that?

08:40.287 --> 08:42.590
- Uh, let me guess.
By thinking outside the box?

08:42.623 --> 08:43.890
- [chuckles]

08:43.924 --> 08:47.761
- I want us to forget
the box ever existed.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.262
Ron, what are you
working on?

08:49.296 --> 08:53.133
- Literally...the box.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.768
- Ron, I did not know that.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.104
This morning, my train
was blown off the track,

08:57.137 --> 08:59.873
which apparently happens
every day around here.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.676
Let's come up with something
that solves things like that.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.678
- That's a brilliant idea.
Let me just summon a wizard.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.647
Shazam!
Ah, nothing.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.181
Have you ever even made
a product?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.950
- Well, n--no.

09:09.983 --> 09:13.721
[all groaning]

09:13.754 --> 09:15.923
No, but I was sixth
in my class at Wharton.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.691
- Ron, is that a product?
- Not a product.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.760
- No, I was President
of the Young Leaders Group.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.796
- Ron, surely that's a product.
- Ooh, guess again, Teddy.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.599
- Well, guess what?
This company needs a big idea

09:25.633 --> 09:26.934
that you haven't delivered.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.969
So I suggest you take
my lead on this

09:29.002 --> 09:30.303
because I know
what I'm doing.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.039
Okay,
Van hired me for a reason.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.373
[laughter]

09:33.406 --> 09:35.876
- Yeah, because the other people
didn't work out.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.811
- What other people?
- You're the fifth new boss

09:37.845 --> 09:39.079
we've had this year.

09:39.112 --> 09:42.149
And I refuse to let myself
get attached.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.751
I'm not getting hurt again.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.152
- But we'll do
whatever you want

09:45.185 --> 09:47.688
until number six
comes along.

09:47.721 --> 09:51.925
- Just to be clear, I'm not
gonna do whatever you want,

09:51.959 --> 09:53.661
so...

09:53.694 --> 09:56.664
- [humming, strumming guitar]

09:56.697 --> 09:58.999
*

10:04.371 --> 10:07.841
- You fired four people
before you got to me?

10:07.875 --> 10:09.677
- Technically,
they weren't fired.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.712
One was crushed by rubble
before he started.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.648
I like to think of that
as God firing him.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.083
- Don't you think you should
have told me that

10:16.116 --> 10:18.218
in the interview?

10:19.219 --> 10:20.788
- You want the real scoop?

10:20.821 --> 10:22.389
You want to pop the hood
on this van

10:22.422 --> 10:24.758
and see what's inside?

10:24.792 --> 10:26.727
- Yes.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.828
- Fine.

10:29.096 --> 10:32.966
I was supposed to be promoted
to the Gotham office last year.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.336
But then Bob Lackey
from WayneBev pulled the idea

10:36.369 --> 10:38.405
for Wayne Light Lime
out of his ass

10:38.438 --> 10:40.941
and he took my spot!

10:40.974 --> 10:42.676
The only reason you're here

10:42.710 --> 10:44.144
is to come up
with a big idea

10:44.177 --> 10:49.149
to get me out of this
God-forsaken taint of a city.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.751
- And I will.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.419
It just might
take a little time.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.855
I'm sure Wayne Light Lime
didn't happen overnight.

10:54.888 --> 10:59.292
- The man left a lime in a beer,
literally overnight.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.295
Get me to Gotham,
or somebody else will.

11:02.329 --> 11:06.299
[dramatic music]

11:06.333 --> 11:08.001
- If he thinks I'm scared,
I'm not.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.270
I'm going to get the team
to come up with a big idea.

11:10.303 --> 11:13.273
- Yeah, they seem to love you.

11:13.306 --> 11:16.944
*

11:16.977 --> 11:18.445
- [groans]
Okay.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.714
Maybe I came on
a little strong.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.082
To get the best out of people,

11:22.115 --> 11:23.917
you need to get to know them
on a personal level.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.452
- Yeah, that line is underlined
three times

11:25.485 --> 11:27.154
in your business book.
You left it in the kitchen.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.790
- We need to bond as a unit.
- Mm, that line was circled.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.324
- A boss can't be afraid
to look human.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.760
- That line was starred.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.427
Is a star more or less
than a circle?

11:34.461 --> 11:37.030
- Stop going through my book.

11:38.766 --> 11:41.869
A star is greater that a circle,
but less than a heart.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.040
- Wayne Security?

11:47.074 --> 11:48.942
- [growling]

11:48.976 --> 11:52.245
Citizens of Charm City,

11:52.279 --> 11:54.782
this is Jack-O-Lantern

11:54.815 --> 11:57.851
with a personal message
for Crimson Fox.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.452
You can run...

11:59.486 --> 12:02.155
- Shut up, shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.224
- Bruce Wayne is on the phone
for you.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.293
- Jackie,
if you are lying to me,

12:06.326 --> 12:07.494
I'll put rocks in your pockets

12:07.527 --> 12:08.962
and I will throw you
in the ocean.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.964
- You are gonna make
a great father one day.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.165
It's really Bruce.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.367
- Oh, my God.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.869
How do I look?

12:15.903 --> 12:18.972
- Like you don't understand
how phones work.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.408
- [exhales deeply]

12:21.441 --> 12:23.510
B-Dubs, baby!

12:23.543 --> 12:26.113
You keeping Gotham warm
for me?

12:26.146 --> 12:29.249
Yes!
I can hold.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.018
*

12:31.051 --> 12:32.352
- Hey, guys, wait up.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.554
[beeping]
What's that sound?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.389
- It's a device I built
that warns you

12:36.423 --> 12:38.258
when someone you don't like
is approaching.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.861
I call it the "Emily Alert."

12:40.894 --> 12:43.430
- Well, that's very impressive.
And mean.

12:43.463 --> 12:46.399
Look, I get it, you guys
have had lots of bosses,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.869
but it's my job
to make sure we deliver,

12:48.902 --> 12:50.838
and I'm trying to help us
do that.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.305
- Look, we know you're trying,

12:52.339 --> 12:54.074
but you don't need
to give us pep talks.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.843
We've come up with hundreds
of big ideas,

12:55.876 --> 12:57.544
and every one of them
gets shot down by corporate

12:57.577 --> 12:59.546
because they're too expensive.
- Or too dangerous.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.348
- Or you need a piece of the sun
to power it,

13:01.381 --> 13:03.150
and that's impossible to get.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.919
- We're done getting our hopes
up so they can get crushed.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.856
- Well, I'm not giving up.
I believe in this team.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.024
And I'm not going anywhere.

13:11.058 --> 13:14.594
- Everyone, come out here.
I have some terrible news.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.529
We've all been fired.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.265
- Wait, what?
- Wait, wait, wait.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.301
By "we" you mean Emily,
right?

13:21.334 --> 13:24.004
- I did.
But also everyone else.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.439
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, I can't lose this job.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.008
I take care
of my sick grandma.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.409
all: Aww.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.578
- And I like nice things.
[all groaning]

13:31.611 --> 13:33.046
I should have went
before Ron.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.448
- Wait, why are they
shutting us down?

13:35.482 --> 13:38.418
- Bruce says we're obsolete.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.587
Gone are the days of a man
in a bandit mask

13:40.620 --> 13:42.322
stealing a ruby
from a museum.

13:42.355 --> 13:45.859
Now it's all just super villains
trying to destroy the Earth

13:45.893 --> 13:47.895
and superheroes fighting
one another

13:47.928 --> 13:49.329
for vaguely defined reasons.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.565
Our products are powerless
to stop that.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.201
- So he just gave up on us?

13:54.234 --> 13:56.203
I thought we were here
to change the world.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.338
- [chuckles]
Who told you that?

13:58.371 --> 14:01.641
- It's the company motto.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.577
- Oh, that.
No, that came with the office.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.347
This used to be
a diaper company.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.349
[solemn music]

14:09.382 --> 14:10.417
- [sighs]

14:10.450 --> 14:11.618
*

14:16.689 --> 14:19.092
- There's gotta be something
we can do.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.260
- [slurping]

14:20.293 --> 14:22.262
[quirky music]

14:22.295 --> 14:24.397
- Why are you drinking
champagne?

14:24.431 --> 14:27.667
- Oh, because I'm so sad.
[chuckles]

14:27.700 --> 14:30.470
I'm sorry, I didn't want to say
anything in front of the others,

14:30.503 --> 14:33.040
but I'm being absorbed
into the Gotham office.

14:33.073 --> 14:36.409
If I knew I could fail up,
I would have done it years ago.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.245
- So, everyone loses their job,

14:38.278 --> 14:39.679
and you get exactly
what you want?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.949
- I don't know why
I was so stressed

14:41.982 --> 14:43.583
about finding that big idea.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.453
The big idea is,
I'm a Wayne.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.589
And a Wayne will always
come out on top.

14:49.622 --> 14:52.559
You know, I feel like I could
commit vehicular manslaughter

14:52.592 --> 14:54.928
and I would get away
with just a slap on the wrist.

14:54.962 --> 14:57.630
Now, I haven't done that,
but now...

14:57.664 --> 14:59.666
I feel like I could.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.235
- How long do we have
until it becomes official?

15:02.269 --> 15:05.238
[upbeat music]

15:05.272 --> 15:07.640
*

15:07.674 --> 15:09.676
Guys, I've got good news.
[beeping]

15:09.709 --> 15:13.080
- Damn, I've got to boost
the radius on my Emily Alert.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.682
- So, I just spoke to Van,

15:15.715 --> 15:17.985
and we're not going
to lose our jobs.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.286
- Wait, what?

15:19.319 --> 15:21.721
Guys, Emily said
we're not losing our jobs!

15:21.754 --> 15:23.323
[all cheering]

15:23.356 --> 15:25.392
- Technically,
we haven't been shut down yet.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.494
There is still hope.
- Oh, never mind.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.196
She was just trying
to inspire us.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.197
We're still fired.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.364
[all groaning]

15:31.398 --> 15:32.365
- Bruce Wayne wrote,

15:32.399 --> 15:34.067
"Winners are just losers

15:34.101 --> 15:35.568
that don't accept defeat."

15:35.602 --> 15:37.537
If we came op
with a game-changing product,

15:37.570 --> 15:39.472
Bruce would have
to reconsider.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.474
- Ooh, me, me, me,
me, me, me!

15:41.508 --> 15:44.044
I mean, unless you guys
want to go first.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.312
I'm totally cool about it.

15:45.345 --> 15:46.446
- All you.
- No, I don't want to do it.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.448
- Okay, now, we all know

15:48.481 --> 15:50.717
that the number one cause
of workplace accidents

15:50.750 --> 15:53.220
is Superman crashing through
office windows mid-fight.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.688
That's a simple fact.
But now...

15:55.722 --> 15:58.191
this glass is made
of Kryptonite.

15:58.225 --> 16:01.428
So if he flies close to it,
his powers will weaken,

16:01.461 --> 16:04.064
and he'll safely bounce off.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.532
- Nice, and how does it work

16:05.565 --> 16:09.136
when the people inside
need help from Superman?

16:09.169 --> 16:14.007
- I had not taken that scenario
into account.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.442
[glass shattering]

16:15.475 --> 16:19.212
It's also not very strong
against normal things.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.547
- Okay,
I am not demoralized.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.615
I'm just going to take
a five real quick.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.352
- Hey, wait.
You haven't heard my idea yet.

16:25.385 --> 16:29.122
So, you know how everyone wants
to have sex with robots, right?

16:30.623 --> 16:33.160
- Go on.
- I'm listening.

16:33.193 --> 16:37.497
*

16:37.530 --> 16:39.399
- "Problems are just
opportunities

16:39.432 --> 16:40.667
dressed in work clothes."

16:40.700 --> 16:43.336
You're aware this means nothing,
right?

16:43.370 --> 16:44.671
- I give up.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.406
I took this job
to make a difference,

16:46.439 --> 16:48.275
and I didn't even
get a chance.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.577
- Oh, honey,
no one makes a difference.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.445
I used to be
just like you.

16:52.479 --> 16:53.780
- I think
we're pretty different.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.048
- Oh, yeah?

16:55.082 --> 16:57.650
This me my first day
of work here.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.686
- Oh, no.
I have that shirt.

16:59.719 --> 17:03.223
- Sorry, honey.
Welcome to the real world.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.425
[zapping]

17:05.458 --> 17:07.493
We should probably
go inside soon

17:07.527 --> 17:10.230
because there's an evil pumpkin
flying around.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.464
- Citizens of Charm City,

17:12.499 --> 17:17.170
kiss your precious
organic juice bar good-bye!

17:17.204 --> 17:18.570
[people shouting]

17:19.872 --> 17:21.641
- "You don't need to have
superpowers

17:21.674 --> 17:23.843
to accomplish great things.
Love, Dad."

17:23.876 --> 17:25.612
- He gave this to me
when I was little.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.147
I always keep it with me.
- That's so sweet.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.517
And now you're smelling it
like a creepy person.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.552
- Oh.
My dad ran a flower shop.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.687
Everything he touched
smelled like flowers.

17:34.721 --> 17:38.591
I used to know when he was
around before I even saw him.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.495
I feel like I let him down.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.197
- [evil laughter]
[zapping]

17:44.231 --> 17:46.566
- I wish we knew that guy was
around before we saw him.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.269
- Yeah, it would save
a lot of lives.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.371
[distant shouting, crashing]

17:51.404 --> 17:55.408
Oh, my God.
Maybe there's a way.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.744
Guys, I have an idea.

17:57.777 --> 18:01.148
- Good, 'cause Wendy's sex robot
is not market ready.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.520
- Guys, just hear me out.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.822
Now, remember how I said
I wanted us to invent something

18:09.856 --> 18:11.824
that would stop things
like that train attack?

18:11.858 --> 18:13.293
- Right,
and then we laughed at you.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.361
[laughter]

18:14.394 --> 18:16.363
- Wendy, what if you could
boost your Emily Alert

18:16.396 --> 18:18.198
to have a wider radius?
- It's maxed out.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.599
You have to be
in visual range.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.401
- But what if it worked
on scent?

18:21.434 --> 18:23.803
- We could totally rig it
to use chemoreceptors.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.205
- And what if we used it

18:25.238 --> 18:26.873
to track super villains,
and what if--

18:26.906 --> 18:31.211
- And what if who cares,
because we're all fired?

18:31.244 --> 18:33.913
- Look, I know you've all
been beaten down in this job.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.283
And you feel like
what we do doesn't matter.

18:36.316 --> 18:39.286
But I truly believe
we can change lives,

18:39.319 --> 18:41.888
and I know deep down
you still care.

18:41.921 --> 18:45.225
[soft music]

18:45.258 --> 18:49.729
*

18:49.762 --> 18:52.765
- Can I pick the color?

18:52.799 --> 18:56.736
*

18:56.769 --> 18:58.905
- It's 7:00 a.m.
What am I doing here?

18:58.938 --> 19:02.242
- Van, this device we've created
has just alerted me

19:02.275 --> 19:03.776
that Jack-O-Lantern
is in the area,

19:03.810 --> 19:06.313
giving us enough time
to get to safety.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.248
- It uses advanced
chemoreceptors

19:08.281 --> 19:10.617
to pick up on Jack-O-Lantern's
unique smell profile.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.519
- We call it
the "Jack-O-Lert."

19:12.552 --> 19:15.422
- It is sleek, stylish,
and available in sangria.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.825
- I see.
I'm having a hard time figuring

19:18.858 --> 19:20.760
why you'd think I would care.

19:20.793 --> 19:24.264
I already picked out
a penthouse in Gotham City.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.798
- Well, the way I see it,

19:25.832 --> 19:28.268
if you don't take this to Bruce,
maybe I will,

19:28.301 --> 19:30.537
and maybe I'll be the one
sipping Wayne Light Lime

19:30.570 --> 19:33.440
in my Gotham office.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.442
- Okay, I take your point.

19:35.475 --> 19:38.578
But none of this matters
because your Jack-O-Lert

19:38.611 --> 19:40.213
detects jack squat.

19:40.247 --> 19:40.947
[explosion]

19:40.980 --> 19:43.550
- Citizens of Charm City,

19:43.583 --> 19:48.788
prepare to feel
my powerful balls of fire!

19:48.821 --> 19:51.291
[explosions and screaming]

19:51.324 --> 19:53.793
- Fine.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.729
I'll take it to Bruce.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.732
[suspenseful music]

19:59.766 --> 20:01.368
*

20:01.401 --> 20:02.635
[elevator dings]

20:02.669 --> 20:04.271
*

20:04.304 --> 20:07.307
Everybody,
I have some terrible news.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.976
I'm not gonna get
to go to Gotham.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.545
- Tell them the other news.

20:12.579 --> 20:13.880
- I got a parking ticket.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.382
- We're not fired.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.316
[all cheering]

20:16.349 --> 20:18.285
Wayne Security is staying open.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.487
- Yeah, Bruce loved
the Jack-O-Lert.

20:20.520 --> 20:23.456
He's putting it in beta,
wherever that is.

20:23.490 --> 20:24.824
- So great.
Did he mention the color?

20:24.857 --> 20:26.326
- No.
- Damn it.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.960
- But he did say
because I did such a good job

20:27.994 --> 20:29.962
inspiring all of you,
he wants me to stay here

20:29.996 --> 20:32.465
to continue inspiring you.

20:32.499 --> 20:36.636
I guess with great power
comes living in a taint.

20:36.669 --> 20:37.737
Emily...

20:37.770 --> 20:39.839
[rousing music]

20:39.872 --> 20:42.342
I blame you.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.344
I blame you.

20:44.377 --> 20:47.414
*

20:47.447 --> 20:50.417
[all cheering]

20:50.450 --> 20:56.389
*

20:57.657 --> 20:59.025
- You guys did it.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.993
You should be really proud
of yourselves.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.762
- We couldn't have done it
without you.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.664
- No.
We got you a little something.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.066
- It's a bus pass.
It's a much safer alternative

21:07.099 --> 21:10.870
to the train.
A little Charm City insider tip.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.072
- You guys, thank you.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.375
- I didn't chip in.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.377
- I would not expect that.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.778
To the R&D team.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.514
- To Emily.
all: To Emily.

21:21.548 --> 21:22.815
- This just in:

21:22.849 --> 21:26.619
Gotham City police report
the Joker has been apprehended.

21:26.653 --> 21:32.024
Batman used a new device
that tracked him by his smell.

21:32.058 --> 21:34.861
And now for a correction...

21:34.894 --> 21:36.529
- What a crazy coincidence.

21:36.563 --> 21:38.798
Batman came up
with his own Jack-O-Lert.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.900
- In midnight black.
Subtle.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.669
Powerful.
Slimming.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.337
- I wish we worked for Batman.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.906
I feel like
he'd really get us.

21:46.939 --> 21:50.042
- Well, maybe someday we will.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.978
*

21:52.011 --> 21:53.613
- Ha, that's funny.
