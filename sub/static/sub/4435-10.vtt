It's the holiday season,

00:41.000 --> 00:43.415
but the good times are ending,

00:43.541 --> 00:46.415
because what matters most
isn't what's good --

00:46.541 --> 00:48.540
It's what's trending.

00:48.666 --> 00:52.457
This younger generation,
with their eyes and ears glued,

00:52.583 --> 00:53.582
what's trending to them

00:53.708 --> 00:55.749
is trenders
who trend on YouTube.

00:55.875 --> 00:58.082
How's it going, brahs?
This is Cartmanbrah!

00:58.208 --> 01:01.415
Comments on commentators,
it's all changing so fast.

01:01.541 --> 01:05.749
Playing Xbox with your brother
is just a thing of the past.

01:05.875 --> 01:07.957
Now, with Ma and her iPad

01:08.083 --> 01:09.999
and Dad trending or trying,

01:10.125 --> 01:13.624
all the family is scattered
and the living room's dying.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.749
Because it wasn't
the outdoors or church

01:16.875 --> 01:18.415
or even trips to go ski.

01:18.541 --> 01:20.957
What brought families
together most

01:21.083 --> 01:23.082
was a good old TV.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.582
Now we watch things
by ourselves

01:25.708 --> 01:26.832
and just tweet what we saw,

01:26.958 --> 01:28.915
and if you try to complain,
you get called a...

01:29.041 --> 01:30.582
Grandpa!

01:30.708 --> 01:33.332
I'm not a grandpa!

01:33.458 --> 01:36.999
But now let me tweet this
for you all to comment upon.

01:37.125 --> 01:41.249
The more connected we get,
the more alone we become.

01:41.375 --> 01:44.749
If you want change like I do
and feel the same gloom,

01:44.875 --> 01:50.665
then please follow this
trend -- #savethelivingroom.

01:50.791 --> 01:53.082
What do you think?

01:53.208 --> 01:55.915
Hmm, it's kind of gay.

01:56.041 --> 01:56.915
Really?

01:57.041 --> 01:58.915
I mean, having it all rhyme
and stuff, you know?

01:59.041 --> 02:02.290
I wasn't really going for gay.
I was more going for wholesome.

02:02.416 --> 02:04.957
- Well, gay's wholesome.
- But it's got to be perfect.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.249
We're trending well, but we need
to attract more followers

02:07.375 --> 02:09.040
who want
good old family values.

02:10.208 --> 02:13.332
Kyle, Bill Cosby is here
to see you.

02:14.208 --> 02:15.582
Bill Cosby?

02:15.708 --> 02:16.457
Yes.

02:16.583 --> 02:19.040
Is here?
To see me?

02:19.166 --> 02:20.707
Yes.

02:23.375 --> 02:26.582
Oh, there he is,
coming down the stairs.

02:26.708 --> 02:28.624
- Hello.
- Hello, son.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.457
Your "save the living room"
hashtag

02:30.583 --> 02:33.040
is getting a lot of attention,
and we think it's great.

02:33.166 --> 02:33.957
We?

02:34.083 --> 02:37.582
I'm just a small part of
a big, epic holiday special

02:37.708 --> 02:39.957
which is gonna air
this weekend.

02:40.083 --> 02:43.040
It's a shame how families
don't gather in the living room

02:43.166 --> 02:44.082
like they used to,

02:44.208 --> 02:46.082
and we think
a big holiday special

02:46.208 --> 02:48.290
is just the thing
America needs.

02:48.416 --> 02:50.457
Wow!
Well, that's awesome!

02:50.583 --> 02:51.915
Well, the producers
of the show

02:52.041 --> 02:53.457
saw how much
your idea was trending

02:53.583 --> 02:56.707
and thought we should get
your hashtag on board with ours.

02:56.833 --> 02:57.999
I'd love to.

02:58.125 --> 03:00.540
Great! I'll go right now
and tell them you're on board.

03:00.666 --> 03:01.957
We got to do this quickly.

03:02.083 --> 03:03.499
Okay. No problem.

03:03.625 --> 03:04.832
This holiday special

03:04.958 --> 03:07.665
is going to bring families
together again, son.

03:07.791 --> 03:11.290
- Thanks, Mr. Cosby!
- Happy holidays!

03:14.500 --> 03:16.999
Mr. Marsh, forgive me
if I say your story sounds

03:17.125 --> 03:18.582
a little far-fetched.

03:18.708 --> 03:20.874
You're saying that these people
who want you killed

03:21.000 --> 03:22.749
are entertainment producers?

03:22.875 --> 03:24.249
Yes, they made a copy of me,

03:24.375 --> 03:25.999
and they don't want me around
anymore.

03:26.125 --> 03:27.749
They're about to do
something big,

03:27.875 --> 03:30.290
and they need famous artists
to be controlled for it.

03:30.416 --> 03:32.749
- Who's the famous artist?
- Me!

03:32.875 --> 03:34.415
Oh, right,
I forgot to tell you that part.

03:34.541 --> 03:36.207
I'm actually Lorde.

03:36.333 --> 03:37.790
You're Lorde?

03:37.916 --> 03:40.832
The 19-year-old female pop star.
It's true. That's him.

03:40.958 --> 03:42.415
You mean the girl
who just showed her asshole

03:42.541 --> 03:43.540
on "Jimmy Fallon"?

03:43.666 --> 03:45.457
No!
That was a copy of me!

03:45.583 --> 03:47.790
Right. The thing
I jacked off to was you.

03:47.916 --> 03:48.957
Ha.

03:49.083 --> 03:50.499
Look, I don't know
what they're up to,

03:50.625 --> 03:53.332
but these people have
something much darker planned.

03:53.458 --> 03:55.749
Detective Harris! Sir!
We've got a problem.

03:55.875 --> 03:57.082
What is it, Adams?

03:57.208 --> 03:58.332
We've arrested a black man

03:58.458 --> 04:00.332
who was snooping around
the old Jefferson estate.

04:00.458 --> 04:02.957
- Did you choke him?
- Yes.

04:03.041 --> 04:04.874
- Did you shoot him?
- Yes!

04:05.000 --> 04:06.707
So, what's the problem?

04:06.833 --> 04:09.457
He appears to be
just a hologram, sir.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.665
No, it's ignorant!

04:10.791 --> 04:12.790

promote it.

This is Cartmanbrah!

And it looks like we're
in the producer's office

05:59.250 --> 06:01.582
in Los Angeles now.

06:01.708 --> 06:03.665
So far, the holiday special
is trending fine,

06:03.791 --> 06:06.499
but it appears that
the Michael Jackson hologram

06:06.625 --> 06:08.124
is the most heavily tweeted.

06:08.250 --> 06:11.124
And we still have no idea
where the damn hologram is?

06:11.250 --> 06:13.624
Not yet, but Tupac
is close to hunting him down.

06:13.750 --> 06:14.624
Look at that guy.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.457
He's like 40, but he's got
a Justin Bieber haircut.

06:16.583 --> 06:18.415
We've got
one shot at this, people.

06:18.541 --> 06:19.832
This has to be
the holiday special

06:19.958 --> 06:21.790
to end all holiday specials.

06:21.916 --> 06:24.457
Sir, I get that you brought
this YouTube commentator in

06:24.583 --> 06:26.165
because he's popular
with the younger kids,

06:26.291 --> 06:28.749
but now he's trying to tell us
what the show should be called.

06:28.875 --> 06:31.249
He's got his finger
on the pulse of young America.

06:31.375 --> 06:32.749
Sir, I'm pretty sure that

06:32.875 --> 06:35.832
"Washington Redskins' Go Fuck
Yourself Holiday Special"

06:35.958 --> 06:37.165
is not a good name.

06:37.291 --> 06:39.540
No, it's not good.
It's fucking awesome.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.290
If I may be frank, sir,

06:41.416 --> 06:43.874
I think you're giving this kid
a little too much power.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.540
I can hear you, douche bag.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.707
People, you know
what we're trying to do here.

06:47.833 --> 06:49.790
We're trying to finally
create entertainment

06:49.916 --> 06:51.582
that reaches
the younger generation,

06:51.708 --> 06:53.999
that unites
the young with the old.

06:54.125 --> 06:56.582
That means being hip,
being now.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.290
These guys are such
blumpkin catchers.

06:58.416 --> 07:00.624
There. See that?
"Blumpkin catchers."

07:00.750 --> 07:02.790
Do any of you even know
what that means?

07:02.916 --> 07:05.415
This kid is our way to connect
with the youth of America,

07:05.541 --> 07:08.165
and I'm gonna give him
all the power he needs.

07:08.291 --> 07:10.582
Great, great!
Great, great, great!

07:10.708 --> 07:12.832
What about this, sir?

07:12.958 --> 07:14.374
Burnt sienna.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.290
He's not a Native American,
damn it.

07:16.416 --> 07:17.374
That's obvious.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.415
I'll put it in the report
he's Mylar brown.

07:19.541 --> 07:20.540
That isn't even close!

07:20.666 --> 07:21.915
We have to be able to prove

07:22.041 --> 07:24.082
that hologram
is a light-skinned black guy.

07:24.208 --> 07:26.540
Mr. Jackson,
it's me -- Lorde.

07:26.666 --> 07:27.874
Who? Lorde?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.374
You're not Lorde.
Ignorant.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.457
Please. Do you know
what's going on here?

07:31.583 --> 07:33.332
What are the producers
trying to do?

07:33.458 --> 07:35.415
They're gonna make
a big holiday special.

07:35.541 --> 07:37.415
They've got holograms
and YouTube commentators

07:37.541 --> 07:39.082
and live tweeting
and it's ignorant.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.915
It's going to be the most
ignorant holiday special ever!

07:42.041 --> 07:44.540
A holiday special.
Oh, my God.

07:44.666 --> 07:47.082
It's directed at children.
We have to stop them.

07:47.208 --> 07:49.457
H-How about we say
he's mixed race?

07:49.583 --> 07:51.332
As long as Adams only choked
the black half,

07:51.458 --> 07:52.665
I think it's okay.

07:52.791 --> 07:53.665
I should have known.

07:53.791 --> 07:55.374
The bastards
always talked about a day

07:55.500 --> 07:57.040
when social media
and entertainment

07:57.166 --> 07:58.665
would be fused as one.

07:58.791 --> 08:00.832
I didn't know they meant
a Christmas special.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.082
Can you help me stop them?

08:02.208 --> 08:03.749
Yes. We have to reach
the children.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.040
It's our only hope.

08:05.166 --> 08:06.665
Then we'll do it together.

08:06.791 --> 08:08.749
I love children
just as much as you do.

08:08.875 --> 08:10.290
Allegedly!

08:10.416 --> 08:13.457
That was a civil suit,
and there was no evidence!

08:13.583 --> 08:15.749
It's ignorant.

08:16.666 --> 08:18.165
Mom, where is Ike?

08:18.291 --> 08:20.749
Oh, Kyle, your hashtag
is really trending.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.082
I saw the commercial.

08:22.208 --> 08:23.457
That's not
what I was trending.

08:23.583 --> 08:25.374
They took my hashtag
and they raped it!

08:25.500 --> 08:26.457
Where is Ike?!

08:26.583 --> 08:28.790
He's upstairs
playing with all his friends.

08:28.916 --> 08:31.124
Oh, my God.
That's the ugliest...

08:31.250 --> 08:32.790
Ike, you are no longer
to watch

08:32.916 --> 08:34.457
that stupid little
YouTube-blogging asshole.

08:34.583 --> 08:35.457
Do you understand?

08:35.583 --> 08:36.457
You damn kids following

08:36.583 --> 08:38.165
these YouTube commentators
is bad enough,

08:38.291 --> 08:40.249
but I will not have them
invading my living room.

08:40.375 --> 08:42.040
Old people are so funny.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.290
They really just
don't get it.

08:44.416 --> 08:47.207
And they smell like soap.

08:47.333 --> 08:48.249
We are not old people.

08:48.375 --> 08:50.165
You guys are just
into lame, vulgar crap,

08:50.291 --> 08:51.582
and it needs to be stopped.

08:51.708 --> 08:54.415
Careful, grandpa.
You might crap your Depends.

08:56.458 --> 08:58.124
We're not being grandpas!

08:58.250 --> 09:00.124
Yeah, you damn kids!

09:00.250 --> 09:03.624
Okay, okay, so we're agreeing
the hologram is black.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.290
So the question is,
if he's black,

09:05.416 --> 09:07.832
then how come
we couldn't choke him?

09:12.416 --> 09:14.249
Can I help you?

09:15.916 --> 09:17.707
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

09:21.083 --> 09:22.082
Sir?

09:22.208 --> 09:24.999
A black guy walked
into the police station.

09:25.125 --> 09:26.915
Uh-huh?

09:27.041 --> 09:30.249
Well, a black guy
walked into the police station.

09:30.375 --> 09:31.957
Yeah? Wait, Mitchell,
listen to this one.

09:32.083 --> 09:33.332
Start over.
What's the setup?

09:33.458 --> 09:36.165
There's this black guy,
walked into the police station.

09:36.291 --> 09:37.957
Oh, yeah, I think I've heard it,
but go ahead.

09:38.083 --> 09:39.957
No. Really.
A black guy walked into --

09:40.083 --> 09:42.207
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
"We set who free?"

09:42.333 --> 09:46.082
No, no. A black guy literally
walked into the police station.

09:46.208 --> 09:47.665
Oh, it's a new one.

09:47.791 --> 09:49.290
Oh, shit, look out!

09:49.416 --> 09:51.290
It's a black guy!
Choke him!

09:51.416 --> 09:52.290
Shoot him!

09:52.416 --> 09:53.665
Shoot him
and then choke him!

09:56.541 --> 09:57.874
He's here to kill us!
Run!

09:58.000 --> 09:59.040
♪ Hee hee! ♪

10:09.583 --> 10:12.457
Cartman,
open this door right now!

10:12.583 --> 10:14.582
Ha ha! Look at Kyle, brahs.
He's all pissed off.

10:14.708 --> 10:15.999
Cartmanbrah!

10:16.125 --> 10:17.624
What the hell
are you doing?

10:17.750 --> 10:19.665
What's it look like I'm doing?
I'm trending, Kyle.

10:19.791 --> 10:21.790
I'm trending more than
ever thought possible.

10:21.916 --> 10:23.624
Come out here and talk to me
face-to-face.

10:23.750 --> 10:24.624
Open this door!

10:24.750 --> 10:26.624
How do you even know
I'm here in my room?

10:26.750 --> 10:29.124
Because you just said
"here in my room."

10:29.250 --> 10:30.374
Very impressive, Kyle.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.082
But the holiday special
is beginning soon.

10:32.208 --> 10:34.874
I'm afraid I can't let there be
any distractions.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.790
You will find
that my door has been sealed

10:36.916 --> 10:38.874
with 3/4-inch plywood
and a polymer metal alloy

10:39.000 --> 10:40.582
secured with drywall screws.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.665
Cartman, please.
We have to stop this show.

10:42.791 --> 10:44.124
Lorde is gonna do
something horrible

10:44.250 --> 10:45.457
and corrupt little girls
everywhere.

10:45.583 --> 10:46.790
Why does that matter?

10:46.916 --> 10:49.457
Because Lorde is my dad,
all right?!

10:52.333 --> 10:53.874
Lorde is my dad.

10:54.000 --> 10:54.832
What?

10:54.958 --> 10:56.790
What are you talking about,
Stan?

10:56.916 --> 10:59.290
He does it all
with computers and processors.

10:59.416 --> 11:01.457
He got discovered
on the Internet.

11:01.583 --> 11:03.624
He's like
the PewDiePie of music.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.082
Then he played live last week,
he rubbed his clit,

11:06.208 --> 11:08.040
and started trending
more than ever.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.415
I thought
he learned his lesson,

11:10.541 --> 11:12.665
but it's like
he doesn't care.

11:12.791 --> 11:13.957
Sorry, guys.
I got to go.

11:14.083 --> 11:17.249
The world needs Cartmanbrah.

11:17.375 --> 11:20.165
Why didn't you tell me, Stan?
I would have helped.

11:20.291 --> 11:23.624
It just all seemed so stupid.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.332
I'll call the producers
of the show.

11:25.458 --> 11:26.915
They'll help you find
your dad.

11:27.041 --> 11:28.915
See if it started!

11:29.041 --> 11:31.124
We don't really use this thing
anymore.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.332
It hasn't started yet.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.249
All right, Sharon,
get on your computer upstairs.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.207
Mr. Jackson, you can take
the one in my son's room.

11:36.333 --> 11:38.040
We've got to tell people
the truth.

11:38.166 --> 11:40.790
Randy, what about Shelly?

11:40.916 --> 11:42.290
Oh, my God.

11:42.416 --> 11:44.582
Shelly? Who's Shelly?
That's ignorant.

11:44.708 --> 11:45.749
My daughter.

11:45.875 --> 11:48.540
She has no idea
that I'm Lorde.

11:48.666 --> 11:51.290
I can't let her find out
from the Internet.

11:51.416 --> 11:54.332
I have to tell her the truth
before we all tell the world.

11:54.458 --> 11:55.499
How are you gonna tell her

11:55.625 --> 11:59.040
that the singer she's idolized
has been you?

11:59.166 --> 12:02.665
I guess one step at a time.

12:04.875 --> 12:07.999
Shelly, um, I'm Lorde.

12:08.125 --> 12:10.624
All the music you've really been
into has been me.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.749
Nobody in the family knew,
except for your mother.

12:12.875 --> 12:13.957
And your brother.
And your Grampa.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.332
But Michael Jackson's hologram
is here,

12:15.458 --> 12:16.957
and we're gonna
set the record straight, okay?

12:17.083 --> 12:19.207
Love you.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.624
That was hard.

12:21.750 --> 12:24.165
Randy!

12:24.291 --> 12:26.249
It started.

12:26.375 --> 12:29.874
And now Nabisco
and Dolly Madison present

12:30.000 --> 12:34.332
"The Washington Redskins' Go
Fuck Yourself Holiday Special."

12:36.958 --> 12:40.332
And now, live via hologram,
it's Kurt Cobain.

How are we trending?

13:16.166 --> 13:18.332
Trending at 64% and steady.

13:18.458 --> 13:20.415
We're trending at 64%, sir.

13:20.541 --> 13:21.415
Excellent.

13:21.541 --> 13:25.207
I'm just about to deal with
our last order of business now.

13:25.333 --> 13:26.707
Thanks for seeing us, sir.

13:26.833 --> 13:28.874
My friend is really worried
about his dad.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.374
No, no.
Thank you.

13:30.500 --> 13:34.290
If you hadn't have called,
I wouldn't know what I know now.

13:34.416 --> 13:36.749
Um, look, if I could just
talk to him real quick.

13:36.875 --> 13:39.457
I want to try and stop him from
making an ass of himself again.

13:39.583 --> 13:40.707
It's me.

13:40.833 --> 13:43.249
I've got something
you might be interested in.

13:43.375 --> 13:45.707
I don't think so,
you son of a bitch.

13:45.833 --> 13:47.790
I've got your son here,
Lorde.

13:47.916 --> 13:50.707
If you don't cooperate,
he dies.

13:50.833 --> 13:51.707
What?

13:51.833 --> 13:54.707
Stanley!
You leave him out of this!

13:54.833 --> 13:56.457
Randy, where are you going?

13:56.583 --> 13:57.540
They've got Stan!

13:57.666 --> 13:59.665
Just stay here
with Michael Jackson.

13:59.791 --> 14:01.874
Shit!

14:07.583 --> 14:08.499
All right, listen up.

14:08.625 --> 14:10.749
We believe this is where
the black people are.

14:10.875 --> 14:13.665
They're holograms, so we can't
choke them or shoot them.

14:13.791 --> 14:16.207
So stand by till we figure out
what the hell to do.

14:16.333 --> 14:19.874
Sir, you better see this.
There's something new trending.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.707

14:22.833 --> 14:24.249
We know we can't,
but we're trying to!

14:24.375 --> 14:25.957
Jesus!
Tell them we're working on it!

14:26.083 --> 14:28.582
No, sir, I think they mean
we shouldn't,

14:28.708 --> 14:30.290
like we're racist
or something.

14:30.416 --> 14:32.207
What?
We're not racist.

14:32.333 --> 14:33.582
Sir, we've got confirmation.

14:33.708 --> 14:36.082
There's two black guys
in the upstairs of the house.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.915
Uh-huh.
Go ahead.

14:38.041 --> 14:40.582
Two black guys. One of them
is threatening the other one.

14:40.708 --> 14:41.582
Yeah?
Hang on.

14:41.708 --> 14:43.915
Mitch! Two black guys
in the upstairs of the house.

14:44.041 --> 14:45.665
One of them
is threatening the other one.

14:45.791 --> 14:46.749
Okay, go ahead.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.582

15:10.208 --> 15:12.207
I've never seen trending
like this.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.457
We're trending well?

15:13.583 --> 15:14.915
We're barely trending
at all.

15:15.041 --> 15:18.832
But #ihatecartmanbrah
is trending off the charts.

15:18.958 --> 15:19.999
He's right.

15:20.125 --> 15:23.290
#lhatecartmanbrah
is trending at 96% and climbing.

15:23.416 --> 15:25.790
That's impossible.

15:25.916 --> 15:28.207
How can you be willing
to kill people

15:28.333 --> 15:29.624
for a holiday special?

15:29.750 --> 15:31.040
What's wrong with you?

15:31.166 --> 15:35.957
It was five years ago
that I became a grandpa.

15:36.083 --> 15:37.832
At first, it was wonderful.

15:37.958 --> 15:40.457
I wanted to
show my grandson everything,

15:40.583 --> 15:43.415
teach him all about
the entertainment business.

15:43.541 --> 15:47.332
One day I asked him,
"Who's your favorite celebrity?"

15:47.458 --> 15:49.624
You know what he said to me?

15:49.750 --> 15:53.624
He said, "PewDiePie!"

15:53.750 --> 15:56.749
I had no idea
who he was talking about,

15:56.875 --> 15:58.290
so I looked it up.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.915
And here was this insignificant
little game blogger from Sweden

16:02.041 --> 16:05.207
who my grandson
thought was a god.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.499
No matter who else
I tried to impress him with,

16:07.625 --> 16:10.165
he would just say, "Meh."

16:10.291 --> 16:12.290
To me! "Meh"!

16:12.416 --> 16:15.082
What the hell is wrong
with these kids today?

16:15.208 --> 16:17.249
With this special,
we will assimilate

16:17.375 --> 16:20.124
this younger generation's
culture into ours,

16:20.250 --> 16:24.082
make them appreciate
real entertainment, damn it!

16:24.208 --> 16:26.624
Dude, you're such a grandpa.

Maybe we should turn it off.

16:55.750 --> 16:56.957
Oh, wow,
where are we now, brahs?

16:57.083 --> 16:58.290
This looks pretty stupid.

16:58.416 --> 17:00.457
- What the heck?
- Cartmanbrah!

17:00.583 --> 17:01.749
This damn TV!

17:01.875 --> 17:04.624
What is that window doing
outside the holiday special?

17:04.750 --> 17:05.957
Call customer service.

17:07.416 --> 17:08.957
Panasonic
customer service.

17:09.083 --> 17:09.957
How can I help you?

17:10.083 --> 17:12.249
Yeah, we've got a commenter
window in our living room.

17:12.375 --> 17:13.790
How do I get rid of that?

17:13.916 --> 17:16.457
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Many people
are calling about this.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.707
We have no idea
what's going on.

17:18.833 --> 17:21.165
Have I answered all your
questions in a timely manner?

17:21.291 --> 17:23.374
Looks like we've reached
customer service, brahs.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.874
Now we can truly be everywhere.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.457
This isn't part
of the holiday special.

17:27.583 --> 17:28.832
What is he doing?

17:28.958 --> 17:31.624
He's trending more than
we ever thought possible.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.915
Yes, with every passing second,
I become more powerful.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.624
Okay.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.707
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

17:40.833 --> 17:42.749
Go ahead.

17:42.875 --> 17:47.290
So then the first black guy
said to the second black guy,

17:47.416 --> 17:50.457
"Don't shoot me.
I'm on your side."

17:50.583 --> 17:53.207
Okay! Okay!

17:53.333 --> 17:54.582
Okay, hold on.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.499
Okay, go ahead.

17:56.625 --> 18:00.290
And then the tattooed black guy
says to him,

18:00.416 --> 18:04.582
"I ain't gonna kill you, man.
You're the King of Pop.

18:04.708 --> 18:07.457
Let's go cap
that whitey producer."

18:07.583 --> 18:09.332
Okay! Stop!

18:09.458 --> 18:11.332
Stop! Stop!

18:11.458 --> 18:12.957
Happy holidays, everyone.

18:13.083 --> 18:15.582
Enjoy the rest of your lives
with Cartmanbrah.

18:15.708 --> 18:17.665
Damn it,
you're ruining the show.

18:17.791 --> 18:19.915
Of course I am.
This isn't about you.

18:20.041 --> 18:21.957
This is about Cartmanbrah,
brah.

18:22.083 --> 18:23.332
I am so confused.

18:23.458 --> 18:25.415
Shut him down!

18:25.541 --> 18:26.540
We can't, sir!

18:26.666 --> 18:27.874
I am trending so much

18:28.000 --> 18:30.540
that soon I will reach
"trend-scendence."

18:30.666 --> 18:32.915
Like Johnny Depp, but cool.

18:33.041 --> 18:35.332
I'm confused. What is
holiday special and what isn't?

18:35.458 --> 18:37.374
It's all Cartmanbrah now.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.665
I am trending into something
more than human.

18:40.791 --> 18:43.582
I am becoming "trends-gender."

18:43.708 --> 18:46.374
Now they will have to give me
my own bathroom.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.915
This is not
what I hired you for!

18:49.041 --> 18:51.457
I control talent, damn it!

18:51.583 --> 18:54.957
There he is!
That's the ignorant man.

18:55.083 --> 18:57.874
This is crazy, and everyone
is watching everything!

18:58.000 --> 19:00.499
Everyone
is watching everything.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.290
Ike?

19:03.416 --> 19:06.457
Ike, if you can hear me,
I'm sorry.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.457
I have been a grandpa.

19:08.583 --> 19:10.999
I didn't understand
the things you were into,

19:11.125 --> 19:13.665
and I thought you should just
like the same stuff I did.

19:13.791 --> 19:15.999
I have to accept that you're
gonna have your own things.

19:16.125 --> 19:17.665
I just didn't want you
to watch him.

19:17.791 --> 19:21.624
I just -- I just want to be
a family again.

19:21.750 --> 19:24.040
Aw, I feel bad
for the little guy.

19:24.166 --> 19:27.374
There's nothing sadder
than an old man crying.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.332
- Maybe we should help.
- Yeah!

19:29.458 --> 19:30.790
Okay.

19:30.916 --> 19:32.582
Help?
How can you help?

19:32.708 --> 19:33.790
It's the holiday season.

19:33.916 --> 19:36.832
We just need to get everyone
to believe again.

19:36.958 --> 19:39.540
Yeah, someone can
come change all this.

19:39.666 --> 19:41.374
You know who.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.957
Really?
That's what you guys would do?

19:44.083 --> 19:47.999
Of course! We just need to get
everyone to believe in him.

19:48.125 --> 19:50.165
He'll always come and help.

19:50.291 --> 19:52.332
#Webelieveinyou.

19:52.458 --> 19:55.374
Oh, my God, you're right.
You're totally right.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.040
Everyone,
get a new trend going, fast!

19:58.166 --> 19:59.374
#Webelieveinyou.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.415
We believe in you!
Of course!

20:02.541 --> 20:06.332
You, too, right now.
#Webelieveinyou.

20:06.458 --> 20:08.874
We've got to make him appear.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.582
Hey!
Hey, what's going on?

20:10.708 --> 20:12.999
What is that?

20:13.125 --> 20:15.540
How's it going, bros?
This is PewDiePie!

20:15.666 --> 20:16.874
What the hell?!

20:17.000 --> 20:18.999
- PewDiePie!
- PewDiePie!

20:19.125 --> 20:19.957
PewDiePie?

20:20.083 --> 20:21.332
Thanks for all the shout-outs.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.207
I guess there's some little
fat kid trying to be me,

20:23.333 --> 20:24.207
so let's check it out.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.332
Get out of here, PewDiePie.
This is my holiday special!

20:26.458 --> 20:27.790
God damn it,
get out of here.

20:27.916 --> 20:30.207
Uh, everyone tweet now if you
want to get rid of PewDiePie.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.040
This show is getting
kind of boring, bros.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.499
What do you say we change it up
to something more exciting?

20:34.625 --> 20:37.040
Please show your support
for Cartmanbrah right now by --

20:37.166 --> 20:39.082
I know!
Let's play Call of Duty.

20:39.208 --> 20:40.832
No! You can't do this!

20:40.958 --> 20:43.374
Oh, yeah.
This is more like it, bros.

20:43.500 --> 20:44.874
God damn it, who the hell
do you think you are?!

20:45.000 --> 20:45.874
If you don't stop
right now --

20:46.000 --> 20:47.707
Okay, that little fat kid
is getting annoying.

20:47.833 --> 20:49.040
Let's get rid of him.

20:49.166 --> 20:50.582
No-o-o-o-o!

20:50.708 --> 20:52.415
Oh, yeah!
Way better, bros.

20:52.541 --> 20:54.040
This is how we do it
in Sweden.

20:54.166 --> 20:56.915
Boom! Head shot.
Boom! Head shot.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.749
Well, I finally got my family

21:07.875 --> 21:10.249
to use the living room
for an hour each night.

21:10.375 --> 21:12.040
I'm still
really confused, dude.

21:12.166 --> 21:13.374
I have no idea
what that was about.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.790
Yeah. And I guess
that's the point.

21:15.916 --> 21:17.749
I don't think
we're gonna understand.

21:17.875 --> 21:19.915
Maybe this is all the beginning
of a new art form.

21:20.041 --> 21:21.874
YouTube celebrities
are only getting bigger,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.457
and what's great is that these
people are inventing themselves

21:24.583 --> 21:26.749
instead of being marketed
and shoved down our throats.

21:26.875 --> 21:27.749
Yeah.

21:27.875 --> 21:29.832
No matter what we think,
it's not just a passing trend.

21:29.958 --> 21:30.832
We need to realize

21:30.958 --> 21:33.415
that the new generation
of entertainment is here.

21:33.541 --> 21:34.999
And I think that's great.

21:35.125 --> 21:37.165
Yeah,
I think that's great, too.

21:37.291 --> 21:39.624
All right, bros, it looks like
we'll have to end it there.

21:39.750 --> 21:41.290
I want to thank "South Park"
for being on my show.

21:41.416 --> 21:42.957
I hope you bros
enjoyed watching.

21:43.083 --> 21:45.415
And as always, stay awesome!

21:45.541 --> 21:49.165
Oh! That's it, bros.
Show's over.
