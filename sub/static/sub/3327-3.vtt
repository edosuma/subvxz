WEBVTT

00:03.570 --> 00:06.130
(birds singing,
dog barking in distance)

00:11.610 --> 00:15.307
Hey, Adam, remember me?

00:15.340 --> 00:17.399
Going to school,
huh?
Yeah.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.338
Come on, I'll
give you a ride.

00:19.380 --> 00:21.644
It's okay. It's on my way.

00:23.620 --> 00:25.315
What are those for?

00:25.350 --> 00:27.659
They're for your parents.

00:27.690 --> 00:29.658
Get in, I'll explain.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.302
You're not dressed.

00:45.340 --> 00:47.501
You said you'd go

00:47.540 --> 00:48.700
jogging with me
this morning.

00:48.740 --> 00:50.298
Doesn't sound like me.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.272
Have you been up all night?

00:52.320 --> 00:54.572
I started digging through one
of the files I keep

00:54.620 --> 00:56.679
on open serial murders
after you'd gone to bed,

00:56.720 --> 00:58.312
and I lost track of time.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.659
Still losing track of it,
as a matter of fact,

01:00.690 --> 01:03.079
so, no jogging. Sorry.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.519
I thought we both agreed
that a little exercise would

01:05.560 --> 01:07.790
be a good addition
to your sobriety regimen.

01:07.830 --> 01:10.367
For future reference, when I say
that I agree with you,

01:10.400 --> 01:11.697
it means I'm not listening.

01:11.730 --> 01:14.528
You know what else is great?
Jazzercise.

01:14.570 --> 01:15.764
I'll get you some
leg warmers, a headband.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.301
You'll look awesome.

01:17.340 --> 01:18.432
I agree with you.

01:18.470 --> 01:19.778
The Balloon Man?

01:19.810 --> 01:21.437
Is that who you've
been researching?

01:21.480 --> 01:22.708
Yeah. Came to my attention

01:22.750 --> 01:24.502
while I was still
living in London.

01:24.550 --> 01:26.108
New York's
very own bogeyman.

01:26.150 --> 01:28.175
Obviously,
you've heard of him.
Yeah.

01:28.220 --> 01:29.517
He took his first victim

01:29.550 --> 01:31.711
from Cobble Hill
about seven years ago.

01:31.750 --> 01:34.389
I was living just
a few blocks away. Adam.

01:34.420 --> 01:36.183
Adam something.
I think he's taken

01:36.230 --> 01:37.424
six kids since then?

01:37.460 --> 01:40.258
Seven as of last night.
What?

01:40.300 --> 01:42.518
I heard it on my police
scanner app around midnight.

01:42.570 --> 01:43.867
Ten-year-old Mariana Castillo

01:43.900 --> 01:46.198
snatched from her bedroom
In Astoria, Queens,

01:46.240 --> 01:48.162
the abductor's signature
batch of balloons

01:48.200 --> 01:49.804
left fluttering behind.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.331
I'd like to think that
Fleet Street would have devised

01:52.380 --> 01:54.439
a more inventive sobriquet
than "The Balloon Man,"

01:54.480 --> 01:56.744
but I do enjoy the inadvertent
E.E. Cummings reference.

01:56.780 --> 01:58.441
Well, if you only heard it
on the scanner, then you haven't

01:58.480 --> 01:59.617
actually been assigned
to the case.

01:59.650 --> 02:01.345
Yet.

02:01.380 --> 02:03.348
Child abductions
and serial murders mean

02:03.390 --> 02:05.381
psychiatric consultants
and joint task forces,

02:05.420 --> 02:07.650
which in turn means _
that Gregson can't call me In

02:07.690 --> 02:09.157
until the police
commissioner approves.

02:09.190 --> 02:11.226
And he doesn't get in
until 8:30 am.

02:11.260 --> 02:12.796
Sharp. Add approximately
three minutes for coffee,

02:12.830 --> 02:14.752
another six for a trip
to the loo.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.223
Should be calling me in about,
hmm, 15 minutes.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.534
(phone ringing)
Or sooner.

02:20.970 --> 02:23.438
Holmes.

02:23.470 --> 02:25.768
Crescent Street, Astoria.

02:25.810 --> 02:27.437
I'll be there presently.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.545
I could have sworn I was wearing
a shirt at some point.

02:34.580 --> 02:35.808
GREGSON:
The girl's bedroom

02:35.850 --> 02:37.647
is in the back.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.908
Perp forced the lock on her
window around 9:30 last night,

02:39.960 --> 02:41.689
took her, tied the
balloons to her bed.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.518
Mom's a painter.
She went to a friend's gallery.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.653
Dad went to the
bodega on the corner

02:46.700 --> 02:49.157
to get some wine
around 9:45.

02:50.330 --> 02:53.436
That's freshly broken.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.961
By the girl, presumably,
grabbing for a handhold.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.864
That's good.
She's a fighter.

02:58.910 --> 03:00.935
If little girls could
actually win fights

03:00.980 --> 03:02.538
against grown men, then, yeah,

03:02.580 --> 03:04.468
it would be a_cause
for great optimism.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.888
(indistinct chatter)

03:11.920 --> 03:13.615
What's this?

03:13.660 --> 03:15.958
Parents are making

03:15.990 --> 03:18.481
a plea to the twist
that took their kid.
They mustn't.

03:18.530 --> 03:19.827
Why not?

03:19.860 --> 03:21.418
Excuse me. You can't do this.

03:21.460 --> 03:22.768
We're live in ten, buddy,

03:22.800 --> 03:24.324
so if you wouldn't mind.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.667
You don't understand. It's...

03:25.700 --> 03:28.897
We're on in ten, nine,
eight, seven, six,

03:28.940 --> 03:30.908
five, four, three...
Look, I'm sorry.

03:30.940 --> 03:34.478
Two, one.
Hey. Sherlock!

03:34.510 --> 03:36.398
I'm sorry. I warned him!
MAN:
What is this?

03:36.450 --> 03:38.475
Who are you?
I'm just the man
who's trying

03:38.510 --> 03:40.239
to keep these people from
killing your daughter.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.770
Mr. Holmes is a consultant with
the department, Mr. Castillo.

03:41.820 --> 03:43.481
Daniel Peters,
Kayla Jackson,
Billy Crawford.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.886
Victims two, three and
five of the Balloon Man.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.615
The only ones whose
bodies were found.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.787
Forensics estimated
he kept Daniel alive

03:49.830 --> 03:52.856
for a full day before burial,
Kayla for half a day,

03:52.900 --> 03:54.697
Billy for almost two days.
Why the discrepancy?

03:54.730 --> 03:56.527
Sherlock, they lost their
daughter. I think...

03:56.570 --> 03:58.367
Last night, I discovered
a direct correlation

03:58.400 --> 03:59.731
between the quickness

03:59.770 --> 04:01.499
with which the killer
dispatched his victims

04:01.540 --> 04:03.030
and the extent of their
parents' media exposure.

04:03.070 --> 04:05.038
I could show you
the spreadsheet,

04:05.070 --> 04:07.004
but in_sum-_-
the more InterVIews,

04:07.040 --> 04:09.008
the faster
the children died.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.473
Is he right?

04:10.510 --> 04:12.046
Usually.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.616
I don't understand.

04:13.650 --> 04:15.379
What does it_ matter
how many InterVIews we do?

04:15.420 --> 04:17.638
The Balloon Man feeds off
the public grief

04:17.690 --> 04:19.043
of his victims' families.

04:19.090 --> 04:20.751
You nourish him,
he'll get bored, end the game.

04:20.790 --> 04:22.018
Keep him hungry,

04:22.060 --> 04:24.358
we might have two days.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.358
You want to get
your little girl back?

04:26.400 --> 04:29.392
It's simple.
You do everything I say.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.429
WATSON:
Kemper.

05:09.470 --> 05:10.767
Hmm?

05:10.810 --> 05:12.539
That was the name

05:12.580 --> 05:13.899
of the Balloon Man's
first victim.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.931
Adam Kemper.
I just remembered.

05:15.980 --> 05:18.471
The police found those
balloons on the sidewalk

05:18.510 --> 05:20.944
where he'd taken Adam, the
ones that said, "Thank you."

05:20.980 --> 05:23.448
Like Adam's parents had given
him some sort of gift.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.549
I read all the articles
over the years.

05:25.590 --> 05:28.718
I know it destroys
the victims' families,

05:28.760 --> 05:30.079
but being here in
person is just...

05:30.130 --> 05:31.654
Perhaps you'd like
to go outside.

05:31.690 --> 05:34.056
I'm fine, thanks. Ijust...

05:34.100 --> 05:35.829
No, it's not an expression
of concern. It's a request.

05:35.860 --> 05:37.361
You're distracting me.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.697
I'm distracting you.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.436
Because clearly,
this is all about you.

05:42.870 --> 05:45.737
Excuse me!
No, no, no, no, It's okay.

05:45.770 --> 05:47.374
BELL:
Mr. Castillo, you can't

05:47.410 --> 05:49.071
blame yourself
for what happened.

05:49.110 --> 05:51.499
Actually, he can.

05:51.550 --> 05:52.847
Excuse me?
Not for
your daughter's

05:52.880 --> 05:54.711
abduction, of course.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.547
The kidnapper would have found
a way to take her eventually.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.909
But you can and
should blame yourself

05:57.950 --> 05:59.451
for impeding our
investigation.

05:59.490 --> 06:00.650
I told you everything.

06:00.690 --> 06:02.851
If everything includes
one very big lie.

06:02.890 --> 06:04.778
Where's the wine that you
claimed you were buying

06:04.830 --> 06:06.127
when your daughter
was taken last night?

06:06.160 --> 06:08.128
In your hand.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.969
And there's the lie.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.389
Bodegas put the price tag
on the cap itself.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.135
It saves stacking time.

06:14.170 --> 06:16.934
Tag-- bottom.
You-- liar.

06:16.970 --> 06:19.837
Obviously, you bought this
at another time,

06:19.880 --> 06:21.472
presumably from the liquor store

06:21.510 --> 06:22.807
on Atlantic where
you purchased

06:22.850 --> 06:25.000
the case_ of Prosecco
you have In your pantry.

06:25.050 --> 06:26.540
The bottle was
already in your fridge,

06:26.580 --> 06:28.013
so it provided
an effective cover

06:28.050 --> 06:29.938
as to why you were really
out of the house.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.982
Tell us her name, Mr. Castillo,
right now.

06:33.020 --> 06:34.419
Whose name?

06:34.460 --> 06:36.087
His mistress.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.758
(laughs)
There's
no p0Int

06:37.790 --> 06:39.087
in trying to deny it.

06:39.130 --> 06:40.597
Your lemon press gave you away.

06:40.630 --> 06:42.996
Well, presses, to be precise.
One old.

06:43.030 --> 06:45.498
One quite new,
less than a year. The pattern

06:45.530 --> 06:47.168
repeats itself with
your two corkscrews,

06:47.200 --> 06:48.861
the pepper mills.
The older items

06:48.900 --> 06:50.162
belong to you and your wife.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.166
The doubles were bought
by you when you moved

06:52.210 --> 06:53.837
into your own place
on Long Island.
How...?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.632
I found a letter in your
mail forwarded to you

06:55.680 --> 06:58.171
from a long-term stay
hotel chain in Islip.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.916
I assume that you
and your wife separated

06:59.950 --> 07:01.770
for a while,
and then reconciled?

07:01.820 --> 07:03.583
Which brings me
to your Caller ID.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.178
You took a 15-second call

07:05.220 --> 07:07.552
from a Long Island area code

07:07.590 --> 07:09.979
last night right before
you stepped out of the house.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.952
Presumably, from the woman who
precipitated your separation.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.992
She rang, you walked
out of the house.

07:14.030 --> 07:16.567
Why else would you hide
information from the police

07:16.600 --> 07:18.989
when you're clearly desperate
to get your daughter back?

07:21.740 --> 07:26.063
When Sara and I were separated,
I dated a co-worker.

07:26.110 --> 07:29.602
She called me last night, said
she was in the neighborhood

07:29.650 --> 07:31.538
and needed to see
me, but I swear,

07:31.580 --> 07:33.673
I only went out to
tell her the she had

07:33.720 --> 07:35.676
to stay away
for good.
How could you
not say anything?

07:35.720 --> 07:37.244
Where did you meet her?

07:37.290 --> 07:40.714
On the street, a few houses
down from here, but I swear,

07:40.760 --> 07:43.228
I didn't go into her car.
I just talked to her

07:43.260 --> 07:45.125
through her window.
I'd like to speak with her.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.594
She had nothing
to do with this.
Probably not, but can you think

07:47.630 --> 07:49.769
of anyone else who was parked
on your block last night?

07:49.800 --> 07:51.097
'Cause if she was
waItIng for you,

07:51.130 --> 07:52.836
I assume she was
facmg your house.

07:52.870 --> 07:53.859
If she was facing
your house...

07:53.900 --> 07:55.492
Maybe she saw
something that

07:55.540 --> 07:57.735
could help us find the guy
who took your daughter.

07:59.310 --> 08:01.107
I'm sorry. (sniffles)

08:01.140 --> 08:03.847
I just... I can't believe
I'm the reason

08:06.650 --> 08:09.915
IfI hadn't called him, then...

08:09.950 --> 08:12.987
GREGSON:
Now, Ms.-Ms. Thomas,
it's all right.

08:13.020 --> 08:15.682
Did you see or hear anything
out of the ordinary?

08:15.720 --> 08:16.982
I never got out of my car.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.622
So, what now?

08:18.660 --> 08:20.252
THOMAS:
I was just looking
at Roberto...

08:20.300 --> 08:21.927
Do we go back to the Castillo
house, talk to the parents more?

08:21.960 --> 08:23.825
You're doing it again--
talking.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.599
What? I'm not
supposed to talk?

08:25.630 --> 08:26.892
Situations like these,

08:26.940 --> 08:28.692
cases that require
my total concentration--

08:28.740 --> 08:30.628
I talk to you,
never the other way around.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.035
What in the hell...?
Shh, shh.

08:32.070 --> 08:34.903
THOMAS:
...and I headed
for the corner,

08:34.940 --> 08:39.718
and then, um, some other car ran
the stop sign, almost hit me.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.718
This was approximately when?
Never mind.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.047
I already know. 9:40.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.614
The vine that the girl managed

08:44.650 --> 08:46.242
to pull free from the side
of the house-- it means

08:46.290 --> 08:47.951
she was awake and struggling
when Balloon Man took her.

08:47.990 --> 08:49.309
So?

08:49.360 --> 08:51.282
So, examinations of
the three victims whose bodies

08:51.330 --> 08:53.252
were recovered indicated
that he chloroformed them.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.690
He got sloppy with Mariana
Castillo, rushed things.

08:56.730 --> 08:59.164
Why? Because of the sirens.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.736
What sirens?

09:00.770 --> 09:02.294
Listening to my scanner
last night,

09:02.340 --> 09:04.604
I heard a report that preceded
Roberto Castillo's call

09:04.640 --> 09:06.301
to 911 by mere minutes.

09:06.340 --> 09:09.776
Some sort of domestic dispute.
A squad car was dispatched

09:09.810 --> 09:12.677
to an address less than two
blocks from the Castillo home,

09:12.720 --> 09:14.608
sirens blaring.

09:14.650 --> 09:17.039
You think the perp panicked, and
thought the sirens were for him.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.887
So he grabbed
the girl and ran.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.616
Stashed her in his car, and
then tore through the stop sign.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.059
Right in front
of Ms. Thomas here.

09:23.090 --> 09:25.058
BELL:
The car that almost hit you--

09:25.090 --> 09:26.352
do you remember
what it looked like?

09:26.390 --> 09:29.359
Um, actually,
it was a van.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.925
It's a kidnapper's vehicle of
choice. What else? Make? Model?

09:31.970 --> 09:33.790
It happened so fast.

09:33.840 --> 09:37.037
Uh, I'm not really a car person.

09:37.070 --> 09:39.675
Are you a color person? I'll get
you started. Red? Blue? Black?

09:39.710 --> 09:42.679
Brown. Dark brown.

09:42.710 --> 09:45.201
So, what are we
looking for?

09:45.250 --> 09:47.218
Home security camera?

09:47.250 --> 09:49.810
Neighbor
with a photographic memory?

09:52.960 --> 09:55.815
Hey, care to explain what
you said back at the station

09:55.860 --> 10:01.093
about, you know, you talking
to me, not the other way around?

10:01.130 --> 10:03.189
Yes, well aware
I'm doing it again.

10:03.230 --> 10:04.720
I've found, over the years,

10:04.770 --> 10:06.362
that nothing clears up
a difficult case

10:06.400 --> 10:08.732
so much as stating it
to another person.

10:08.770 --> 10:10.658
I talk, they listen,
and in talking,

10:10.710 --> 10:12.974
I make connections
I may have otherWIse mIssed.

10:13.010 --> 10:15.205
One-way street, not two.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.276
Who did you speak
to back in London?

10:17.310 --> 10:20.211
Oh, lots of people.
Waitstaff, cabdrivers.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.241
The occasional prostitute.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.840
Better listeners
than you might think.

10:24.890 --> 10:27.154
Right. You don't look good.

10:27.190 --> 10:29.249
My appearance has always meant
so much to me.

10:29.290 --> 10:31.121
You haven't eaten
today, have you?
(sighs)

10:31.160 --> 10:32.957
No sleep,
no food...

10:33.000 --> 10:34.422
Will make Sherlock
a dull boy.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.860
People in recovery
have a tendency to relapse

10:36.900 --> 10:38.219
when they
haven't eaten...

10:38.270 --> 10:39.737
You know what, Watson?

10:39.770 --> 10:41.032
I take it all back.

10:41.070 --> 10:42.731
I'm beginning
to find the chatter

10:42.770 --> 10:43.998
that accompanies
your companionship

10:44.040 --> 10:45.302
extremely useful.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.137
A bit like white noise.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.445
It puts me in a state where
I think, and I observe better.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.107
For example...

10:52.150 --> 10:55.711
What? If this is your idea
of a brown van,

10:55.750 --> 10:57.445
then you're even more
sleep-deprived than I thought.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.754
Note the parking tickets. Hmm?

10:59.790 --> 11:01.781
It's been here for days.
Yet there are small

11:01.820 --> 11:03.082
skid marks beneath each tire,

11:03.130 --> 11:04.950
indicating it's been moved
several inches.

11:06.090 --> 11:08.797
Someone sideswiped it.

11:08.830 --> 11:10.764
My money is
on a speeding van

11:10.800 --> 11:12.836
dnven
by a panicked kidnapper.

11:12.870 --> 11:15.737
Well, the paint from the
other car is supposed to be...

11:15.770 --> 11:18.159
It's dark brown as per
Ms. Thomas' description.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.933
mixed in with the brown.
Means it's brown now,

11:21.980 --> 11:24.175
but was originally painted
white and blue--

11:24.210 --> 11:26.974
a very distinctive white
and blue as a matter of fact.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.976
Detective Bell.

11:29.020 --> 11:31.181
Excuse me.

11:32.350 --> 11:34.454
We are looking for a
decommissioned NYPD van,

11:34.490 --> 11:36.788
presumably sold at auction,
then painted brown.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.320
It has a long scrape
down one side

11:38.360 --> 11:39.827
where it struck
this sedan.

11:39.860 --> 11:41.191
Issue the BOLO now,

11:41.230 --> 11:44.097
we may find the Balloon
Man before lunch.

11:52.110 --> 11:54.078
I'm not sleeping.

11:54.110 --> 11:56.305
I'm just reviewing the details
of the case in my mind.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.375
I'm sorry, were
you talking to me?

11:57.410 --> 11:58.877
'Cause I thought I was

11:58.910 --> 12:00.878
just a cavernous expanse
between two ears.

12:02.450 --> 12:04.418
You mustn't be
so senSItIve, Watson.

12:04.450 --> 12:08.716
The service you're providing
is quite valuable.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.428
For _a brief stretch
In London,

12:15.460 --> 12:19.021
I talked only to a phrenology
bust I kept in my study.

12:19.070 --> 12:21.038
I named him Angus.

12:21.070 --> 12:22.492
Wasn't the same.

12:22.540 --> 12:25.429
I realized that when
it came to listeners,

12:25.470 --> 12:29.338
I preferred animate
to inanimate.

12:29.380 --> 12:30.802
Was quite
a breakthrough, really.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.478
Angus.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.842
I'm glad I made it to
the animate category.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.257
Just got a hit
on our BOLO.

12:41.290 --> 12:43.383
Car Five, you
still got the eye?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.250
CAR FIVE:
Yeah, driver's a male white
wearing a hoodie.

12:45.290 --> 12:47.190
All I can make out.

12:47.230 --> 12:49.118
Aviation One, you
getting anything on
the thermal imaging?

12:49.160 --> 12:50.866
AVIATION ONE:
Negahve.
We're too high to see if...

12:50.900 --> 12:53.232
CAR FIVE:
He made us.
Heading north on 78th.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.105
(sirens wailing)

13:05.980 --> 13:08.346
Police!
Hands up!

13:10.050 --> 13:11.847
(grunts)

13:16.320 --> 13:18.151
She's not here.

13:18.190 --> 13:20.351
(indistinct radio transmission)

13:21.460 --> 13:23.860
(panﬁng)

13:25.070 --> 13:27.038
Cap, that's not our guy.

13:27.070 --> 13:28.367
He would have been
in sixth grade

13:28.400 --> 13:30.402
when Balloon Man took
his first victim.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.069
GREGSON:
Hey, what are you doing?

13:39.250 --> 13:40.239
Holmes.
Sorry,

13:40.280 --> 13:41.315
it's just that,
well, according

13:41.350 --> 13:42.476
to that birthmark on his neck,

13:42.520 --> 13:44.317
you're quite right.

13:44.350 --> 13:46.910
This is not the man that took
Adam Kemper back in 2005.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.417
This is Adam Kemper.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.592
BELL:
Adam.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.531
Adam, please
talk to me.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.963
Now, we know who you are, Adam,

14:06.010 --> 14:09.605
your fingerprints confirmed it,
so come on,

14:09.640 --> 14:11.505
tell me how you ended up
in that van.

14:11.550 --> 14:13.279
We've got
a psychiatrist coming,

14:13.320 --> 14:16.983
but I don't think it's going
to make much difference.

14:17.020 --> 14:19.113
This kid just doesn't
want to engage.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.310
WATSON:
Well, have you notified

14:20.360 --> 14:22.157
his parents?
Commissioner

14:22.190 --> 14:23.157
made the call.

14:23.190 --> 14:24.225
They're on their way.

14:24.260 --> 14:25.386
Should only take 'em
an hour

14:25.430 --> 14:27.057
to fight through
all the media outside.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.022
Story of the century, this.

14:29.060 --> 14:33.668
Missing boy presumed dead,
recovered after all these years.

14:33.700 --> 14:36.032
WATSON:
Well, the fact that he was
found in a van that we thought

14:36.070 --> 14:37.560
belonged to the
Balloon Man--

14:37.610 --> 14:39.601
that's obviously more
than a coincidence, right?

14:41.010 --> 14:42.978
I read about a
case like this.

14:43.010 --> 14:45.240
Police in Dubuque
found a 15-year-old

14:45.280 --> 14:47.009
who'd been missing
for seven years.

14:47.050 --> 14:48.369
Now, the man who
had taken him

14:48.420 --> 14:49.944
had enrolled
him in school.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.083
He even let him have
friends over to the house.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.678
The boy never tried to
leave because he had grown

14:53.720 --> 14:55.256
to sympathize
with his captor.

14:55.290 --> 14:57.019
If that's what's
happened here,

14:57.060 --> 14:59.051
it would explain why Adam
was running from the police

14:59.090 --> 15:00.591
instead of to them.

15:00.630 --> 15:02.291
Because he's actually grown
to care for the lunatic.

15:02.330 --> 15:03.695
If Adam's
still alive,

15:03.730 --> 15:06.494
maybe some of the
other victims are, too.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.533
Adam was special-- his first.

15:09.570 --> 15:11.561
The Balloon Man's second
and third victims are

15:11.610 --> 15:13.407
two of only three
to be recovered.

15:13.440 --> 15:16.170
Their condition suggests that
he rather liked the killing.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.516
After he had a taste, I don't
believe he ever looked back.

15:21.550 --> 15:24.519
Question now is,
what role did Adam play

15:24.550 --> 15:25.642
in their deaths?

15:25.690 --> 15:27.419
WATSON:
You think Adam helped him?

15:27.460 --> 15:31.658
Well, you said it yourself:
he sympathized with his captor.

15:31.690 --> 15:34.454
Question is, to what degree?

15:34.500 --> 15:38.027
We did find him
in that van.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.163
CSU is processing it
for evidence

15:40.200 --> 15:42.737
to try and prove whether
Mariana Castillo was inside.

15:42.770 --> 15:45.307
In the meantime, we've got
Adam on auto theft,

15:45.340 --> 15:49.299
but if he doesn't start
talking to us soon,

15:49.340 --> 15:51.046
we're going to run
out of time to find

15:51.080 --> 15:53.071
the Castillo girl.

15:59.620 --> 16:01.019
I want to talk to him.

16:01.060 --> 16:02.550
I think I can get
through to him.

16:02.590 --> 16:05.753
Holmes, this is a
delicate situation.

16:05.790 --> 16:08.156
And I can, on occasion, be
indelicate, I'm well aware,

16:08.200 --> 16:09.519
but if you think
I'd do anything

16:09.560 --> 16:11.266
to jeopardize the
life of that girl...

16:11.300 --> 16:12.528
Intentionally,
of course not.

16:12.570 --> 16:14.538
We're talking
about a kid here--

16:14.570 --> 16:18.233
a kid that's been traumatized,
maybe even brainwashed.

16:18.270 --> 16:20.670
A kid who wouldn't even be
here if it wasn't for me.

16:20.710 --> 16:23.406
What, oh, you think that gives
you the right to question him?

16:23.450 --> 16:26.146
You're a consultant,
not a cop.

16:26.180 --> 16:27.340
And given
the very real possibility

16:27.380 --> 16:28.642
that the young man
is accessory

16:28.680 --> 16:31.319
to several horrific crimes,
maybe "not a cop"

16:31.350 --> 16:33.215
is exactly what he needs
at the moment, hmm?

16:33.260 --> 16:36.013
(elevator bell dings)
Ten minutes--
that's all I ask.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.321
You've got five.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.237
(sighing)

16:55.710 --> 16:58.201
Hello, Adam.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.674
My name is Sherlock.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.585
You can probably tell
from my accent,

17:03.620 --> 17:06.248
I'm not a New York City
police officer,

17:06.290 --> 17:08.656
nor am I_
a psychIatrIst,

17:08.690 --> 17:11.250
which makes me the only person
you're going to talk to today

17:11.290 --> 17:13.554
who isn't going
to lie to you.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.728
The people
who were here earlier--

17:17.770 --> 17:20.739
Detective Bell
and the others--

17:20.770 --> 17:24.228
they told you that the man
who took you seven years ago

17:24.270 --> 17:29.105
was a bad man,
that he hurt you, abused you.

17:29.140 --> 17:31.802
But they don't know
the whole story, do they?

17:31.850 --> 17:33.818
He also took care of you,

17:33.850 --> 17:37.240
kept a roof over your head,

17:37.290 --> 17:39.417
taught you to drive.

17:39.450 --> 17:41.418
Loved you.

17:41.460 --> 17:44.156
My father
packed me off

17:44.190 --> 17:46.488
to boarding school when I was
just eight years old.

17:46.530 --> 17:48.259
(chuckles)

17:48.300 --> 17:49.790
I was a little bit
of a know-it-all--

17:49.830 --> 17:52.822
well, I was
a massive know-it-all, actually.

17:52.870 --> 17:54.690
Turned a lot of the other boys

17:54.740 --> 17:56.560
at the school against me, hmm,

17:56.600 --> 17:59.068
especially one
by the name of Anders Larson.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.430
Now, over the course
of the next year,

18:02.480 --> 18:04.175
Anders took his anger

18:04.210 --> 18:08.772
out on me in, uh,
myriad cruel and terrible ways--

18:08.820 --> 18:12.483
nothing close to what
you experienced, of course, but

18:12.520 --> 18:14.784
it seemed worth mentioning.

18:14.820 --> 18:19.428
You see...
the more Anders hurt me...

18:20.630 --> 18:22.598
...the more I felt gratitude

18:22.630 --> 18:25.793
that he was actually
paying attention to me.

18:25.830 --> 18:27.764
That in, in tormenting me,
he was attempting

18:27.800 --> 18:31.861
to correct what I knew
to be wrong WIth myself.

18:31.910 --> 18:33.878
One day,

18:33.910 --> 18:38.847
after a particularly brutal
lesson...

18:40.280 --> 18:42.248
...left me in a very bad way,

18:42.280 --> 18:45.681
a teacher asked _me
who was responSIble.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.779
I said I'd fallen
down the stairs.

18:47.820 --> 18:49.617
Funny, the things
that we do

18:49.660 --> 18:51.525
for the people
that we care about.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.153
Uh, did he do that to you--

18:56.200 --> 18:58.691
the person that you care about?

18:58.730 --> 19:01.369
No.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.209
I was in my room

19:03.240 --> 19:06.869
the other night...
and it was hot.

19:06.910 --> 19:08.901
I tried to open the window,
but it was stuck,

19:08.940 --> 19:10.874
and my hand went
through the pane.

19:12.210 --> 19:13.416
(whispers
indistinctly)

19:13.450 --> 19:15.441
And he took care of me.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.588
He put a bandage on it.

19:19.620 --> 19:20.757
Of course he did.

19:20.790 --> 19:21.779
He loves you.

19:21.820 --> 19:23.788
He does everything for me.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.183
He comes home

19:25.230 --> 19:26.686
every morning
and brings me doughnuts.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.618
He doesn't need to, but he does.

19:28.660 --> 19:30.628
I never even asked...

19:30.670 --> 19:32.194
No more questions.

19:32.230 --> 19:33.561
He lawyered up.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.589
Via telepathy?

19:34.640 --> 19:35.595
Via his parents.

19:35.640 --> 19:38.359
They're here.

19:38.410 --> 19:39.900
I'm sorry, I
know you have

19:39.940 --> 19:41.737
questions for
Adam, but come on,

19:41.780 --> 19:43.839
you think we don't know that
you think Adam may have had

19:43.880 --> 19:44.949
something to do
with what happened

19:44.980 --> 19:46.777
to the other
children?

19:46.810 --> 19:48.778
It's a possibility, yes,

19:48.820 --> 19:50.845
which is why we'd like
to keep talking to him--

19:50.890 --> 19:53.859
to see if he can help us find
Mariana Castillo.

19:53.890 --> 19:57.587
I can't imagine what they're
going through right now.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.722
Hmm?

19:58.760 --> 19:59.852
By the way, that was
really something

19:59.890 --> 20:01.721
back there with Adam.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.661
The story about your bully
was really very moving.

20:04.700 --> 20:05.826
Any of it true?

20:05.870 --> 20:08.839
I went
to boarding school.

20:08.870 --> 20:10.735
ATTORNEY:
You should know, Captain,
that we've already broached

20:10.770 --> 20:12.601
the possibility
of an immunity deal

20:12.640 --> 20:14.733
with the district attorney's
office.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.475
Adam would be given immunity
for any crimes

20:16.510 --> 20:17.545
he may have been compelled
to commit

20:17.580 --> 20:19.548
by the individual who took him,

20:19.580 --> 20:22.674
and in exchange he'd
tell you everything he
knows about the man.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.813
He'll also help you
try and locate the
bodies of the victims

20:24.850 --> 20:27.614
that were never recovered.
We expect to hear back
from the DA. by morning.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.288
By then it may be too late
for the Castillo girl.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.820
ATTORNEY:
Which is why we
very much hope

20:31.860 --> 20:34.249
that you'll support
our proposal.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.666
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.537
Yes?

20:43.570 --> 20:44.559
Support the proposal,
don't support it.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.032
It doesn't matter.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.776
My conversation with Adam
may have been aborted,

20:47.810 --> 20:49.573
but it was far
from a total waste.

20:49.610 --> 20:51.407
What do you mean?
Adam said the Balloon Man

20:51.450 --> 20:53.668
comes home every morning
with doughnuts.

20:53.720 --> 20:54.869
That means he works nights.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.514
It doesn't sound
like much, I know,

20:57.550 --> 20:59.438
but it's more than we previously
knew about him.

20:59.490 --> 21:00.889
And you think
you can run with that?

21:00.920 --> 21:03.753
From a drop of water, a logician
can infer the possibility

21:03.790 --> 21:05.052
of an Atlantic or a Niagara

21:05.090 --> 21:07.058
without having seen
or heard of either one.

21:07.090 --> 21:08.489
I've got my drop of water.

21:08.530 --> 21:10.361
Now allow me to infer.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.665
WATSON:
He worked nights-- you
think that's really going

21:13.700 --> 21:15.361
to be enough to identify
the Balloon Man?

21:15.400 --> 21:16.936
Of course not,
but it's a start.

21:16.970 --> 21:18.733
Our previous suspect pool
included

21:18.770 --> 21:20.772
virtually every man in the city.

21:20.810 --> 21:23.904
Now it's been reduced
to every man who works nIghts.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.770
You're gonna stay up all
night again, aren't you?

21:25.810 --> 21:27.516
You can't stop me,
Watson.

21:27.550 --> 21:29.370
I don't care how I look,
I don't care how I smell,

21:29.420 --> 21:31.513
I'm not going to sleep.

21:31.550 --> 21:33.689
Well, I have no intention
of stopping you.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.950
I mean, what you're doing
to your body isn't healthy,

21:35.990 --> 21:38.083
you know, especially for
someone so fresh out of rehab,

21:38.130 --> 21:39.552
but I get it.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.057
I will happily loan you
my ears if it means

21:41.100 --> 21:42.624
getting Mariana Castillo
back alive and well.

21:42.660 --> 21:45.060
I appreciate that,
but at the moment

21:45.100 --> 21:46.499
I do not require
a listener.

21:46.530 --> 21:47.895
I will have nothing
to talk about

21:47.940 --> 21:50.500
until I've reviewed
all of these files.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.405
All right, then,
I'll take a box.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.930
No, no, no, it doesn't
work like that.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.402
My brain is the filter

21:55.440 --> 21:56.930
all this needs to go
through, not yours.

21:56.980 --> 21:59.505
I need to read every
word, study every image.

21:59.550 --> 22:00.915
All right, then,
I'll help you stay awake.

22:00.950 --> 22:02.076
All right, you know
where the coffee is.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.849
It's not
about the coffee.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.017
Whoa, then, what
are you proposing?

22:06.050 --> 22:07.654
I'm gonna teach you
something--

22:07.690 --> 22:10.682
a little trick that I learned
back in medical school.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.550
(sighs)

22:12.590 --> 22:14.592
(exhaHng)

22:15.800 --> 22:18.724
This is what they taught
you in medical school?

22:18.770 --> 22:21.933
When I was cramming for a test
and I was tired,

22:21.970 --> 22:24.632
I would do a hundred of these,
get my blood pumping.

22:24.670 --> 22:27.707
Kept me from falling asleep.

22:27.740 --> 22:28.775
I was valedictorian.

22:29.810 --> 22:31.698
I'm just saying.

22:53.800 --> 22:54.994
Watson!

22:55.040 --> 22:56.769
He changed jobs.

22:56.800 --> 22:57.937
VVho?

22:57.970 --> 22:59.506
The Balloon Man.

22:59.540 --> 23:01.405
A few years ago, the
FBI worked a theory

23:01.440 --> 23:03.135
that he was an
extermInator.

23:03.180 --> 23:05.569
Adam Kemper's family had
had their house fumigated

23:05.610 --> 23:06.941
just the week before
he disappeared.

23:06.980 --> 23:08.413
Yes, I'm still
holding, yes.

23:08.450 --> 23:10.111
No one thought
much of it

23:10.150 --> 23:13.813
until these were taken

23:13.860 --> 23:17.580
right outside the homes
of victims two and three.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.154
Oh, both neighbors
had their houses tented.

23:19.190 --> 23:23.627
In 2008, the FBI interviewed
all 35 of the employees

23:23.670 --> 23:25.820
of the company that
fumigated the Kempers' home,

23:25.870 --> 23:27.735
but failed to elicit
any strong suspects.

23:27.770 --> 23:29.692
They eventually discarded their
theory when no connection

23:29.740 --> 23:31.833
to_ extermination was found
In or around the homes

23:31.870 --> 23:33.576
of the subsequent victims.

23:33.610 --> 23:35.737
See, the thing is, I think
they were onto something.

23:35.780 --> 23:37.975
I think the Balloon Man
was an extermInator,

23:38.010 --> 23:40.649
but then changed jobs between
victims three and four.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.443
See this?

23:42.480 --> 23:44.880
It's a copy of The
Investor's Post.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.717
You can tell from
the distinctive

23:46.750 --> 23:48.615
salmon-colored
paper stock.

23:48.660 --> 23:50.719
The parents of victim number
four had a subscription.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.728
As do the parents
of Mariana Castillo,

23:52.760 --> 23:54.057
the most recent victim.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.897
I saw one in their
kitchen yesterday.

23:55.930 --> 23:58.660
The parents of victims
five, six and seven

23:58.700 --> 24:01.737
are not subscribers, but
have neighbors who are.

24:01.770 --> 24:05.558
So the Balloon Man was_an
extermInator; now he deIIvers

24:05.610 --> 24:08.101
papers at night for
The Investor's Post.

24:08.140 --> 24:10.472
Mm, he identified his first
three victims through

24:10.510 --> 24:13.206
his first job, his last five
victims through his second.

24:13.250 --> 24:14.979
I'm on the phone
with the paper now.

24:15.020 --> 24:16.874
They're telling me the name
of the man responsible

24:16.920 --> 24:18.114
for the Castillos' route.

24:18.150 --> 24:19.947
They think I'm
a subscriber,

24:19.990 --> 24:23.153
looking to send
a belated tip.

24:23.190 --> 24:24.452
Yes, yes, hello.

24:29.130 --> 24:30.097
Thank you so much.

24:30.130 --> 24:31.119
Thank you.

24:37.200 --> 24:40.601
See any familiar names?

24:46.610 --> 24:48.578
GREGSON:
Abbott's mother is listed

24:48.620 --> 24:51.919
as the owner of the apartment,
but she died six months ago.

24:53.790 --> 24:56.281
He put it as his home address
the last time

24:56.320 --> 24:57.651
he renewed his driver's license.

25:06.270 --> 25:08.135
Clear!

25:12.240 --> 25:13.901
Clear!

25:18.250 --> 25:19.274
Clear!

25:19.310 --> 25:20.572
We got nothing, Captain.

25:20.620 --> 25:21.746
The place is clean.

25:23.320 --> 25:25.788
What's that?

25:25.820 --> 25:27.287
GREGSON:
Smith, Smith,

25:27.320 --> 25:28.287
head back to that room.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.548
Copy that.

25:36.930 --> 25:38.158
BELL:
"Congrats."

25:38.200 --> 25:39.167
To who?

25:39.200 --> 25:40.167
To us.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.690
For finding his place.

25:41.740 --> 25:44.732
GREGSON:
Smith, what is that
on the balloon?

25:47.240 --> 25:49.538
Bringing it to you, Captain.

25:54.920 --> 25:58.014
You have something that's mine.

25:58.050 --> 25:59.642
You have Adam.

25:59.690 --> 26:02.579
You know who I am
and you know what I can do.

26:02.620 --> 26:04.679
I've already killed six people.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.658
If you haven't
released my son back to me

26:08.700 --> 26:11.191
by noon tomorrow,

26:11.230 --> 26:13.221
you can make it seven.

26:21.980 --> 26:23.038
Please.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.342
Make the trade.

26:24.380 --> 26:26.348
Bring us back our daughter.

26:26.380 --> 26:27.972
I'm afraid it's not that simple,
Mrs. Castillo.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.909
The department can't trade
one victim for another.

26:30.950 --> 26:33.783
Is that what you really
think Adam Kemper is?

26:33.820 --> 26:35.913
I saw on the_ news
thIs mornIng,

26:35.960 --> 26:37.825
the DA. offered him
an immunity deal.

26:37.860 --> 26:40.693
If he's just a victim, what
does he need immunity from?

26:40.730 --> 26:42.254
Given the givens
mmswm,

26:42.300 --> 26:44.689
the DA. felt
he had to offer that deal.

26:44.730 --> 26:47.324
Now, I know the media
has broached the possibility

26:47.370 --> 26:50.703
of Adam being involved somehow
in the Balloon Man's crimes,

26:50.740 --> 26:52.833
but we haven't confirmed
any of that yet.

26:52.870 --> 26:55.338
So how long do we wait for
you to confirm something?

26:55.380 --> 26:57.803
Um, an hour, a day, a week?

26:57.850 --> 27:01.115
I mean, he just said we only
have till noon tomorrow.

27:01.150 --> 27:02.970
Mr. Castillo...
Has anybody asked Adam Kemper

27:03.020 --> 27:04.044
what he wants?

27:04.090 --> 27:06.046
He's 19-- an adult.

27:06.090 --> 27:08.411
If he was really some sort of
partner to this monster,

27:08.460 --> 27:11.952
then isn't it possible
that he wants to go back?

27:11.990 --> 27:13.287
Victims of horrific abuse

27:13.330 --> 27:15.855
are often protective
of their abusers.

27:15.900 --> 27:18.221
It doesn't mean we should
send them back for seconds.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.828
GREGSON:
No, listen,

27:19.870 --> 27:21.667
the immunity deal
is on the table.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.133
Then why hasn't
he taken it?

27:23.170 --> 27:24.706
Because he's been
traumatIzed.

27:24.740 --> 27:27.061
He's hardly speaking,
even to his own parents.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.907
Come on.

27:35.950 --> 27:39.113
If anything happens
to our daughter,

27:39.150 --> 27:41.186
your head is the one we're going
to be calling for in the press.

27:48.130 --> 27:50.325
(door closes)

27:50.360 --> 27:51.793
So now what?

27:51.830 --> 27:53.092
We go back to the files.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.995
We see if there's
any clue that we mIssed

27:55.040 --> 27:56.689
as to where Abbott is
keeping the girl.

27:56.740 --> 27:58.139
That's one option.

27:58.170 --> 27:59.398
You have another?

27:59.440 --> 28:01.237
When Adam's parents
hired a lavwer,

28:01.280 --> 28:03.874
they put a wall
between him and the NYPD.

28:03.910 --> 28:05.901
No cop can talk to him.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.713
No cop.

28:07.750 --> 28:10.173
That's interesting.

28:10.220 --> 28:12.040
And where is he now?

28:12.090 --> 28:13.239
What?

28:13.290 --> 28:14.848
I'm sore.

28:14.890 --> 28:16.778
Only did about a thousand
squats last night.

28:16.820 --> 28:20.927
Listen, I wanted to thank
you for all of your help.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.757
Well, always happy
to listen.

28:22.800 --> 28:23.994
No, no, no,
actually, Watson,

28:24.030 --> 28:25.793
I_ was the one_who
lIstened last nIght,

28:25.830 --> 28:28.196
and I_h_eard someone who
was WIIIIng to accommodate

28:28.240 --> 28:30.435
the difficult process
of a difﬁcult person

28:30.470 --> 28:31.937
for the greater good.

28:31.970 --> 28:34.939
It's a rare quality,
in my experience.

28:34.980 --> 28:38.074
I may even listen to you
again in the future.

28:38.110 --> 28:40.874
Not your sobriety
twaddle, of course.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.478
Just your thoughts
on cases.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.829
Thank you
for seeing me, Adam.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.498
You're the only
one who gets it.

28:57.530 --> 28:59.828
(chuckles softly)

28:59.870 --> 29:02.088
Well, you know by now we've
identified him, don't you?

29:02.140 --> 29:04.108
Samuel Abbott?

29:04.140 --> 29:05.402
Are you worried about him?

29:05.440 --> 29:07.169
He's my dad.

29:07.210 --> 29:09.838
Is that why you've been hesitant
to sign the immunity deal?

29:09.880 --> 29:12.405
Would you turn in your dad?

29:12.450 --> 29:14.509
I'd trade my dad for a Tic Tac,

29:14.550 --> 29:18.042
but that's my dad, not yours.

29:18.090 --> 29:21.548
The sooner we find him,
the better off he'll be.

29:21.590 --> 29:24.855
He hasn't hurt
Mariana Castillo yet.

29:24.890 --> 29:28.394
You loved him...

29:28.430 --> 29:31.263
but you didn't love
what he did.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.029
I can tell.

29:35.340 --> 29:39.060
He did make you help
with the others, didn't he?

29:40.240 --> 29:42.276
He's my dad.

29:42.310 --> 29:44.904
That doesn't mean
it wasn't hard.

29:47.210 --> 29:50.213
Is that why you didn't want
to sign the deal?

29:50.250 --> 29:52.946
Because you don't feel
you deserve it?

30:00.960 --> 30:02.291
I never...

30:02.330 --> 30:06.926
I never knew why it was
so important to him.

30:06.970 --> 30:08.562
ButI loved him.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.307
And when he asked me to take--
help take the others,

30:11.340 --> 30:13.069
then I told him I'd do that.

30:13.110 --> 30:14.304
It's okay.

30:14.340 --> 30:15.500
No, it isn't.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.371
Nothing's okay.
I'm so confused.

30:17.410 --> 30:19.241
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

30:19.280 --> 30:20.542
(sniffling)

30:24.890 --> 30:27.211
You told me the other day
that you'd never lie to me.

30:27.250 --> 30:30.310
That's right.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.578
So tell me.

30:32.630 --> 30:35.098
If I sign that deal,

30:35.130 --> 30:37.257
and if I tell you
where you can find him,

30:37.300 --> 30:40.269
do you think it'll make up
for the things I've done?

30:42.270 --> 30:44.306
No, I don't.

30:45.970 --> 30:48.973
Six other children are dead,
thanks to your dad.

30:50.980 --> 30:54.347
To whatever degree
you assisted him,

30:54.380 --> 30:56.871
you will never get their blood
off your hands.

31:03.560 --> 31:06.859
But that doesn't mean
you shouldn't try.

31:11.470 --> 31:14.997
Okay.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.362
I'll sign the papers.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.162
I'll tell you where we live.

31:20.210 --> 31:21.871
That's where
you'll find the girl.

31:30.250 --> 31:31.387
(loud banging)

31:33.190 --> 31:34.487
(gasps)

31:35.560 --> 31:38.449
Drop the gun and let her go.

31:43.300 --> 31:45.268
Now!

31:48.970 --> 31:51.507
Tell Adam I'm sorry.

31:51.540 --> 31:53.235
(gunshot)

31:53.270 --> 31:56.103
(indistinct radio transmissions,
camera shutter clicking)

31:58.050 --> 32:00.177
Mariana's okay.

32:00.210 --> 32:01.438
She's terrified.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.471
She hasn't been hurt.

32:03.520 --> 32:06.318
You can go home, get some rest.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.411
You okay?

32:09.460 --> 32:11.428
He wasn't what I was expecting.

32:11.460 --> 32:13.655
VVho?
Samuel Abbott.

32:13.690 --> 32:15.521
He dominated Adam.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.448
I was expecting
a more virile man.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.320
Just seems a bit...

32:19.370 --> 32:21.565
feeble.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.158
And that back brace.

32:25.210 --> 32:26.734
WATSON :
Three scars.

32:26.770 --> 32:28.601
Means major surgery, multiple
operations, fused vertebrae.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.471
Makes sense that
he would've needed Adam

32:30.510 --> 32:31.704
to help him get around.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.001
(wind whistling)
Do you hear that?

32:33.050 --> 32:35.177
What?
What...?

32:41.490 --> 32:43.048
WATSON:
My God.

32:43.090 --> 32:44.728
This is where
Adam slept?

32:51.370 --> 32:53.224
(wind whistling)

32:58.670 --> 33:00.001
What's wrong?

33:15.190 --> 33:19.251
That man out there, Abbott,
is not the Balloon Man.

33:26.430 --> 33:28.261
HOLMES:
Hello, Adam.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.568
Mr. Holmes,
what are you doing here?

33:31.610 --> 33:33.430
Thought it was time for
another one of our little chats.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.700
How did you get into my room?
Through the window.

33:35.740 --> 33:38.538
Somehow I managed to open it
without slicing my hand.

33:38.580 --> 33:40.070
You said that...

33:40.110 --> 33:42.419
you cut your hand
trying to open a window

33:42.450 --> 33:43.712
in your room.

33:43.750 --> 33:47.083
Your room.
Not Samuel Abbott's.

33:47.120 --> 33:50.783
So imagine my surprise
when I saw your room today.

33:50.820 --> 33:54.096
Two lamps, proper bed,
television.

33:54.130 --> 33:56.621
Virtual palace
compared to Samuel's room.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.561
All he had was a stained
mattress and a tattered sheet.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.739
No, you're talking
about my room.

34:01.770 --> 34:04.204
That's where he made me sleep.
No,

34:04.240 --> 34:05.798
don't lie to me, Adam,
not again.

34:05.840 --> 34:08.536
You told me when we met
that you injured your hand

34:08.580 --> 34:09.672
trying to open a window

34:09.710 --> 34:11.678
in your room,
the master bedroom.

34:11.710 --> 34:13.109
That's where
the broken pane was.

34:13.150 --> 34:15.414
Samuel Abbott
was not the Balloon Man.

34:15.450 --> 34:17.270
You were.

34:17.320 --> 34:19.811
Mr. Holmes, H...
I examined the pillows

34:19.850 --> 34:22.080
in the larger room--
I found nothing

34:22.120 --> 34:24.281
but short, dark hair--
your hair.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.127
On the pillows
in the smaller room,

34:26.160 --> 34:27.559
I found nothing
but Samuel's hair--

34:27.590 --> 34:29.126
stringy and gray.

34:29.160 --> 34:30.422
You occupied the master bedroom

34:30.460 --> 34:32.166
because you were the master.

34:39.410 --> 34:42.174
(quiet sigh)

34:42.210 --> 34:44.701
You tricked me, Adam.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.844
That doesn't happen very often.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.178
I thought you were a dullard.

34:50.220 --> 34:52.313
You're actually...

34:52.350 --> 34:54.318
quite brilliant.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.180
It must take
a huge intellect

34:56.220 --> 35:00.179
for a boy to turn the tables
on the man who abducted him.

35:00.230 --> 35:02.448
You have no idea.
Whose idea

35:02.500 --> 35:04.627
was it to take more children?

35:04.670 --> 35:07.321
Was it his... or was it yours?

35:07.370 --> 35:10.760
I'd just turned 14;
I was lonely.

35:10.800 --> 35:14.406
No. What you wanted was
to make someone else the victim,

35:14.440 --> 35:15.737
hurt them...

35:15.780 --> 35:17.236
like you'd been hurt.

35:17.280 --> 35:19.145
No, you're forgetting
the parents.

35:19.180 --> 35:22.217
They're the ones
that I got to see on TV,

35:22.250 --> 35:23.774
crying, begging
the monster

35:23.820 --> 35:26.744
who took their son or daughter
to give them back.

35:26.790 --> 35:29.918
See, when Samuel took me,
it was very difficult at first.

35:29.960 --> 35:31.780
I had to put up
with a lot.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.889
But he did let me watch TV,

35:33.930 --> 35:36.751
and so I got to see
my parents on the news

35:36.800 --> 35:39.268
at least once a day, pleading

35:39.300 --> 35:40.790
with Samuel
to let me go.

35:40.830 --> 35:42.263
And the funny
thing was,

35:42.300 --> 35:45.235
he wasn't
the least bit affected.

35:45.270 --> 35:46.908
But I was.

35:46.940 --> 35:48.430
You got off on it.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.777
I really found myself.

35:49.810 --> 35:52.404
And as for how I turned
the tables on him,

35:52.450 --> 35:54.270
let's just say
it's not very difficult

35:54.320 --> 35:56.379
when your captor has an IQ

35:56.420 --> 35:57.910
south of 90.

35:57.950 --> 35:59.815
Psychological abuse
followed by physical--

35:59.850 --> 36:01.386
all very standard.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.285
And the trade
he proposed yesterday--

36:03.320 --> 36:06.380
Mariana for me—-
wasn't even hIs Idea.

36:06.430 --> 36:08.318
_It was a
contIngency plan.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.827
If I ever got caught,
he was supposed

36:09.860 --> 36:11.396
to use the hostage that we had,

36:11.430 --> 36:13.295
or take a new one,
to secure my release.

36:13.330 --> 36:16.493
And the idiot didn't
even have a clue
that the police

36:16.540 --> 36:18.963
would never go for that
in a million years.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.966
But you knew it
would give them incentive

36:21.010 --> 36:22.932
to offer you an immunity deal.

36:24.810 --> 36:26.539
Must have taken
everything you had

36:26.580 --> 36:30.539
not to jump on that deal
the first time it came up.

36:31.750 --> 36:33.945
Are you here to kill me,
Mr. Holmes?

36:33.990 --> 36:36.379
Because I
have to admit

36:36.420 --> 36:40.720
I find the possibility
very... exciting.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.599
I'm gonna go brush my teeth now.

36:45.630 --> 36:48.736
I don't think you're gonna
be here when I get back.

36:49.940 --> 36:51.908
If it's any
consolation,

36:51.940 --> 36:54.977
I don't think I'm gonna stay
in this city much longer.

36:55.010 --> 36:57.604
I think it's time
to move someplace else,

36:57.640 --> 37:00.245
meet new people.

37:00.280 --> 37:03.443
I'm gonna miss our little chats.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.592
WATSON:
I just got an e-mail from my
friend from the D.A.'s office.

37:19.630 --> 37:21.689
He said the language
from the immunity agreement

37:21.740 --> 37:24.300
is pretty ironclad.
"Adam Kemper is immune

37:24.340 --> 37:26.968
from prosecution..."
"For any crimes committed
in consort with Samuel Abbott,

37:27.010 --> 37:28.477
aka the Balloon Man."

37:28.510 --> 37:29.909
Yes, I'm quite familiar
with the phrasing.

37:29.940 --> 37:32.738
I've been reviewing it myself.

37:32.780 --> 37:36.614
(sighs) Look, what that
kid did is... disgusting.

37:36.650 --> 37:38.709
I hate the fact that he's
out there in the world.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.342
But you did make
a difference.

37:40.390 --> 37:41.482
You saved Mariana,

37:41.520 --> 37:42.851
and you told the police

37:42.890 --> 37:44.926
what kind of person
Adam Kemper really is.

37:44.960 --> 37:48.418
I handed a psychopath
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

37:49.660 --> 37:52.720
You're not the only one
he fooled.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.863
If you're trying to blow off
steam, squats would be cheaper.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.492
Easier on the
decor, too.
I can't.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.360
I overdid last night
and pulled a muscle.

37:58.410 --> 37:59.729
My back's been sore all day.

37:59.770 --> 38:02.432
I said a hundred squats,
not a thousand.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.471
Back pain.

38:10.450 --> 38:11.849
Yeah.

38:14.050 --> 38:16.359
Thank you.

38:16.390 --> 38:18.654
Dear sweet...

38:18.690 --> 38:20.385
back pain.

38:20.430 --> 38:22.751
(birds chirping)

38:36.110 --> 38:38.340
Morning, Adam.

38:41.050 --> 38:42.369
(exhales)

38:42.420 --> 38:44.388
You picturing

38:44.420 --> 38:46.411
those two begging for
their son's life?

38:46.450 --> 38:49.510
No, it's nice out-- I'm
just passing the time.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.858
You look kind of tired.

38:51.890 --> 38:54.552
I'm getting that
a lot lately.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.398
Listen, before you leave town,
I wanted to ask you

38:57.430 --> 38:59.398
about William Crawford.

38:59.430 --> 39:00.829
Your fifth victim.

39:00.870 --> 39:03.361
Parents called him Billy.
Ah.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.436
You abducted him on April 3,

39:05.470 --> 39:07.438
2009.
Right, yeah.

39:07.470 --> 39:08.903
Blond boy.
He cried a lot.

39:08.940 --> 39:11.079
Well, yes, I'm sure you
could reminisce all day.

39:11.110 --> 39:13.374
Still, not your
cleanest work.

39:13.410 --> 39:16.846
The police found
his body on April 7.

39:16.880 --> 39:19.110
Yeah, we buried him
deeper after that.

39:19.150 --> 39:21.459
Actually, let me be
clear about that,

39:21.490 --> 39:23.913
in case you have
somebody listening
to our conversations.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.520
Mr. Abbott made me bury
them deeper after that.

39:26.560 --> 39:29.825
Whoever had the idea,
I think it was a good one,

39:29.860 --> 39:34.729
because the police found skin
under William's fingernails.

39:34.770 --> 39:37.933
Definitely came from
one of his attackers.

39:37.970 --> 39:41.474
We ran it against Samuel
Abbott's DNA this morning.
And let me guess

39:41.510 --> 39:42.738
it didn't match.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.839
Is this supposed
to be scaring me?

39:44.880 --> 39:47.144
It's probably mine.

39:47.180 --> 39:50.547
So what?
I have an immunity deal.

39:50.580 --> 39:52.411
Yes, you do.
You cannot be prosecuted

39:52.450 --> 39:55.749
for any crimes committed, quote,
"in consort with," unquote,

39:55.790 --> 39:57.553
the Balloon Man.

39:57.590 --> 39:59.820
Thing is...

39:59.860 --> 40:02.499
Samuel Abbott broke
three vertebrae in his back

40:02.530 --> 40:04.725
on March 23, 2009.

40:04.770 --> 40:07.125
That's why he couldn't work
as an exterminator anymore.

40:07.170 --> 40:09.468
That's why he wore a back brace.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.900
The surgery had him
in hospital for three weeks.

40:11.940 --> 40:15.603
I believe he was
in traction the entire time.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.869
Difficult to abduct
and murder a young boy

40:19.910 --> 40:21.639
when you're feeling well,

40:21.680 --> 40:23.170
I'd imagine.

40:23.220 --> 40:26.815
From a hospital bed,
I'd say it was impossible.

40:27.890 --> 40:30.051
I have an immunity deal.

40:30.090 --> 40:34.993
For crimes committed in consort
with Samuel Abbott.

40:35.030 --> 40:39.569
But you took William Crawford
on your own, didn't you?

40:40.700 --> 40:42.895
What happened?

40:42.940 --> 40:46.569
You get bored while
your playmate was in hospital?

40:48.640 --> 40:49.937
Actually, you know what,
don't tell me,

40:49.980 --> 40:52.801
'cause... I don't care.

40:59.990 --> 41:02.015
Are those for me?

41:02.060 --> 41:05.257
I called them right after
you parents told me
you were in the park.

41:05.290 --> 41:07.884
You're welcome
to try and run.

41:07.930 --> 41:10.819
I've recently started
developing my core, you know?

41:10.860 --> 41:13.829
Could use a bit of a workout.

41:13.870 --> 41:18.034
Oh, no. A fair fight's
not really your speed, is it?

41:22.040 --> 41:24.235
It was only one murder.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.578
And Samuel

41:26.610 --> 41:27.838
abused me.

41:27.880 --> 41:29.871
I'll be out soon.

41:31.050 --> 41:33.041
(birds chirping)

41:36.160 --> 41:38.651
*

41:42.760 --> 41:45.729
* They told me
not to smoke drugs *

41:45.770 --> 41:48.739
* Said I'd wind up in prison
What are you doing?

41:48.770 --> 41:50.590
Depriving you
of all stimuli.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.801
It's time for you
to get some sleep.
What?

41:52.840 --> 41:54.603
No. No, no, no, no. No.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.904
Right after you solve a case
you're flushed with success.

41:56.940 --> 41:58.305
We should double down on work.

41:58.340 --> 41:59.307
We?

41:59.350 --> 42:00.749
You, me...

42:00.780 --> 42:01.917
Angus.

42:03.180 --> 42:04.943
Some combination of the three.

42:04.990 --> 42:07.584
You already know
I favor you. Mm?

42:07.620 --> 42:08.587
Hey!

42:08.620 --> 42:10.258
No! No! This is...

42:10.290 --> 42:12.019
Right now I'm
full of energy,

42:12.060 --> 42:13.584
ideas, momentum.

42:13.630 --> 42:16.121
What kind of_tea is that?
Drowsy-tIme tea.

42:16.160 --> 42:18.924
It detoxifies
and cleanses the system.
Now is the moment

42:18.970 --> 42:21.325
when a true detective
digs into his old files.

42:21.370 --> 42:24.737
You see everything
with a new light. You'll see.

42:24.770 --> 42:28.570
I'm gonna solve three
cases by nightfall.

42:28.610 --> 42:30.931
* You and me,
I had to get out *

42:30.980 --> 42:32.675
* And make a deal

42:32.710 --> 42:35.679
* And learn to know
how It feels, but that... *
