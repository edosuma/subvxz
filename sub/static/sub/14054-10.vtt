00:02.480 --> 00:04.710
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- You and Marissa want different things.

00:04.880 --> 00:07.474
- You don't know what she wants!
- I know what she doesn't want.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.596
I wanna live with Dad.
At least for now. 

00:09.760 --> 00:11.751
Then train me
in the ways of women.

00:11.920 --> 00:15.037
- Why are you helping him with Summer?
- Seth doesn't see me that way.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.679
And you're gonna let that slide?

00:16.840 --> 00:18.717
Is this all part of the plan?

00:18.880 --> 00:21.235
This is a policy-changing,
career-making piece of litigation.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.516
- My wife's company is the plaintiff.
- Her father's company.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.193
- You're gonna take this.
- It's who you married.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.238
If your marriage can't survive this,
what kind of marriage is it?

00:28.400 --> 00:30.356
I wanna make it work. No matter what.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.956
- Ticklish.
- Sorry.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.436
- What time do you have?
- Almost 11.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.592
What time do you have
to be back at your dad's?

01:08.760 --> 01:11.274
- Soon.
- How soon?

01:11.440 --> 01:13.396
Now.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.590
You can't call? Say you'll be late?

01:25.880 --> 01:27.711
I'm already late.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.916
It's a school night.

01:33.640 --> 01:36.473
It's too bad you don't still live next door.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.313
Yeah. But then I'd have
to talk to my mom.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.074
You haven't talked to her?

01:42.240 --> 01:43.719
No.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.599
She keeps trying to call me,
but there's no way I'm...

01:46.760 --> 01:47.988
Hey.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.353
Sorry.

01:56.840 --> 02:01.516
Maybe this weekend,
we could spend a whole night together.

02:04.880 --> 02:08.270
You know, we could go out,
do something.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.634
Finally have our first official date.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.598
No school. No parents. Just us.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.156
Saturday night.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.188
Cool.

02:26.520 --> 02:30.718
Hey, Ryan. Sandy's stuck at the...
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.553
Hey, Kirsten.

02:33.720 --> 02:37.872
Hey, Marissa.
I didn't know that you had company.

02:38.040 --> 02:41.828
Yeah. Well, I was just gonna go.
So see you.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.036
- Later.
- Good night.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.270
Drive safely.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.799
It's never happened with Seth.

03:20.640 --> 03:24.110
- You walked in on them?
- Well, at least I knocked.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.158
Ryan and Marissa Cooper.
I knew it. Didn't I tell you?

03:27.320 --> 03:29.231
- No.
- No?

03:30.840 --> 03:34.310
Sandy, maybe you should talk to him.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.193
- About what?
- You know. Sex.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.830
- Sounds like he knows what he's doing.
- I mean, sex in the house.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.639
- We obviously don't believe in that.
- We don't?

03:44.800 --> 03:48.395
Based on my recent experience,
or lack thereof, I'd have to say no.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.711
Hey, I'm not the one coming home
from the office at midnight.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.472
You come home at 11:45.

03:53.640 --> 03:58.839
I might be coming home earlier
if your firm wasn't suing my company.

04:00.040 --> 04:04.158
Well, look, maybe we'll get lucky
and settle at the conference tomorrow.

04:04.320 --> 04:07.039
Maybe we'll get lucky tonight.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.589
I'd settle for that. What time?

04:09.760 --> 04:11.876
- How about 8?
- Eight?

04:12.040 --> 04:14.190
- Nine?
- Nine-thirty?

04:14.360 --> 04:17.397
- Lf you're not home by 10:00...
- Yeah?

04:17.560 --> 04:20.074
...I'm gonna start without you.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.712
Morning!

04:27.240 --> 04:28.753
Hi.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.878
- We're all very proud.
- Thanks.

04:32.040 --> 04:36.636
And sorry. I just wanted
to say sorry about last night.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.519
- Sorry about what? What did I miss?
- You should talk to him.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.069
I appreciate you guys
being so cool about everything.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.674
- Cool about what?
- I'll see you tonight.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.637
We should get going too.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.155
Not till somebody tells me
what happened.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.709
Mom, would you please fill me in?

04:51.880 --> 04:55.077
Mom!
I get it, I'm just here for comic relief.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.269
So, what exactly did my mom
catch you guys doing?

05:01.440 --> 05:04.113
- Nothing.
- Nothing, huh?

05:04.280 --> 05:06.919
- So you guys haven't...?
- Haven't even had our first date.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.117
- Last night doesn't count?
- No. We're going out Saturday night.

05:10.280 --> 05:12.077
Good. Great.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.231
But you have before, right?

05:16.400 --> 05:19.995
Okay. That's what I thought.
I didn't want to jump to conclusions.

05:20.160 --> 05:23.072
My experience is sort of limited.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.878
- And?
- And what?

05:25.040 --> 05:27.349
Was it awesome?

05:27.520 --> 05:30.398
Which time?

05:30.560 --> 05:32.437
There were...?
How many times were there?

05:32.600 --> 05:37.037
- Same girl or different girls?
- There were different girls?

05:38.080 --> 05:40.230
How many different girls were there?

05:44.160 --> 05:45.878
I have to sit down.

05:46.040 --> 05:49.555
- So, what happened? I want details.
- Nothing happened.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.598
- What's his problem?
- There is no problem.

05:52.760 --> 05:56.719
- I just don't know if I'm ready yet.
- But Luke took care of that painful part.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.474
Yeah, and look how well
that turned out.

05:59.640 --> 06:02.950
Look, Ryan and I, we're still
getting to know each other.

06:03.120 --> 06:06.669
- We're going on our first date Saturday.
- That should be romantic.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.798
Sorry, Coop. It's just, what does
Chino know about a date?

06:09.960 --> 06:12.428
Where he's from,
they don't even have a P.F. Chang's.

06:13.440 --> 06:17.399
When you lost your virginity,
I was playing Magic: The Gathering.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.916
- You still play Magic.
- Yeah, but not as much.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.833
- Hey. What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.797
Ryan was telling me about
your big date.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.632
He's got a whole thing happening.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.836
Wow, there's a whole thing happening?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.629
Yeah, but it's a surprise. It's gonna
be the best date ever. I have to go.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.275
- Summer, I'll walk you to bio.
- I can walk myself.

06:36.440 --> 06:38.192
Great, then you can walk me too.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.238
Best date ever, huh?

06:44.680 --> 06:47.114
The ecological risk assessment
backs up our claim...

06:47.280 --> 06:49.510
...that the land Caleb Nichol
plans to develop...

06:49.680 --> 06:52.831
...should be considered as wetlands.
- Oh, great.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.150
Great. We'll get into that tomorrow.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.550
What do you got tonight?
A hot date?

06:57.720 --> 06:58.948
Yeah.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.635
Sandy Cohen, you are cheating
on me, with your wife.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.228
I'm trying.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.834
- What is it, your anniversary?
- No.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.629
We haven't seen each other
in a while, so we thought we'd...

07:11.800 --> 07:14.678
Go on a date. Why not? Good idea.

07:14.840 --> 07:17.559
It's not like we have
our settlement conference tomorrow...

07:17.720 --> 07:21.156
...where the fate of Orange County's
environment hangs in the balance.

07:22.520 --> 07:27.469
All right. The date will even be better
after the conference. Less stress.

07:28.920 --> 07:32.151
Dad, good news...
I'm sorry, I didn't know you...

07:32.320 --> 07:34.436
- Julie.
- Kirsten.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.398
Your father and I
were just talking about you.

07:37.560 --> 07:41.917
This man just single-handedly saved
the children's hospital benefit.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.719
- I did no such thing.
- He's so modest.

07:44.880 --> 07:48.714
I'd just lost the Buckley yacht,
when he agreed to let me use his.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.440
The man just gives and gives.

07:51.600 --> 07:55.275
I didn't know that you were organizing
the children's hospital benefit.

07:55.440 --> 07:59.797
I wasn't going to, but it's time I stopped
dwelling on my own problems...

07:59.960 --> 08:03.316
...and got back to focusing
on the needs of others, right?

08:03.480 --> 08:05.550
So must be off.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.358
Cal.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.831
I owe you bigtime.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.991
- Bye, Kirsten.
- Bye, Julie.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.638
- She is something, isn't she?
- She is that.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.995
You know, you are now
the official sponsor...

08:22.160 --> 08:24.720
...of the Julie Cooper Comeback Tour.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.508
It's for charity.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.399
After all the bad press
your husband's been getting us...

08:29.560 --> 08:31.755
...it can't hurt to be involved
in a good cause.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.239
So, what was your good news?

08:33.400 --> 08:36.232
We can have that
working dinner after all.

08:36.400 --> 08:40.188
- Sandy cancelled your date?
- They have some last-minute prep work.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.919
- By "they" you mean Sandy and...
- Rachel, yes.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.958
She's attractive?
And he got in at midnight last night?

08:46.120 --> 08:48.111
- I trust him.
- You know what they say.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.396
The only man a girl should trust
is her father.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.074
They're working together. That's all.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.957
I suggest we do the same.
See you later.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.473
Why don't you just take her
to dinner and a movie?

09:03.640 --> 09:04.868
It's a classic combination.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.679
Because somebody promised her
the best date ever.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.355
I went ahead and did a little recon
on your behalf. I was extremely stealth.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.431
I spoke to Summer, okay?
And I asked her...

09:13.600 --> 09:16.637
...what Marissa would wanna do
on a date, what she'd really enjoy.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.836
- She told me she didn't know.
- How helpful.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.913
But Summer's three favorite activities
are shopping, tanning and waxing.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.230
Maybe there's something there.
Use that.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.756
And here I thought
Summer was superficial.

09:28.920 --> 09:32.515
I have no car, no money. Whatever
I do is just gonna disappoint her.

09:32.680 --> 09:35.558
- What do you usually do on dates?
- Never actually been on one.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.029
Wait, you just told me that...

09:38.200 --> 09:43.797
Yeah, I've hung out with girls,
but just never really went out.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.634
- Oh, got it.
- I'm gonna go to class.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.109
- I'll keep working on it.
- You've done enough.

09:50.280 --> 09:52.748
Bye. Come on.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.878
What do you think Summer's
three favorite movies are?

09:57.040 --> 10:00.589
<i>Battleship Potemkin</i>,
<i>The Seventh Seal</i> and <i>Shoah</i>.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.876
- Definitely.
- What?

10:03.040 --> 10:06.635
Can we not talk about Summer?
We talk about her all the time.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.552
No, we don't.

10:08.720 --> 10:12.110
We don't. We talk about
all sorts of things. Music, sailing.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.669
Right. About how you named
your boat after her...

10:14.840 --> 10:17.752
...how you made her a CD of songs
with the word "summer" in it.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.514
Sorry. I was under the impression
that we were friends...

10:20.680 --> 10:22.750
...who, I don't know,
talk about our thoughts.

10:22.920 --> 10:26.674
We are. So I guess you're
finally hearing some of mine.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.874
I'm gonna go back for dessert.

10:41.280 --> 10:44.192
Hey, Dad. I'm...

10:44.360 --> 10:45.839
...home.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.594
- Hi, sweetie.
- What are you doing here?

10:48.760 --> 10:52.435
Your mother was in the neighborhood
and wanted to see how we're doing.

10:52.600 --> 10:56.354
- How are we doing, Mom?
- Why don't you come here and talk to us.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.431
Come on over and sit down.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.677
I'm throwing a party.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.559
I'm hosting the children's hospital benefit
this Saturday.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.632
They're trying to build
a new wing for the children.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.634
I'd love it if you could both be there.
Your father's already agreed.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.597
No. No way.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.716
Marissa, honey...

11:22.880 --> 11:26.714
...this party is a chance for us to show
the community that we still belong...

11:26.880 --> 11:28.871
...that we're still a family.

11:29.040 --> 11:33.033
Yes, we've suffered some setbacks,
your father's business in particular.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.670
But it's important to let everybody know
the Cooper family is back.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.831
Why do you care
what other people think?

11:39.000 --> 11:43.676
Look, Marissa, no one has fewer nice
things to say about your mother than me.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.831
No offense.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.230
But she's been pouring
her heart out to me...

11:48.400 --> 11:53.030
...and I think you're gonna wanna hear
what she has to say.

11:53.800 --> 11:58.828
Marissa, I am so sorry for the way
I handled things at the hospital.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.877
I was scared.

12:01.040 --> 12:03.315
And I was wrong.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.789
Everything I cared about
was falling apart...

12:05.960 --> 12:09.157
...and I was blaming everybody
but myself.

12:12.120 --> 12:15.396
I just want us to feel
like a family again.

12:17.400 --> 12:22.269
I know it's gonna take some time,
and I'm gonna need your help.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.038
Will you help me?

12:35.200 --> 12:37.555
Wow, knocking. It's open!

12:43.480 --> 12:44.754
Bad news.

12:44.920 --> 12:49.391
I know you had Saturday night
all planned, but something's come up.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.993
Oh, that sucks.

12:51.160 --> 12:54.197
We're gonna be spending
a romantic night on a yacht...

12:54.360 --> 12:58.672
...for this charity event
hosted by my mom.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.434
Your mom hates me.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.989
No, she doesn't hate you.
She just doesn't know you.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.639
Now she'll have her chance.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.712
We had a date Saturday night.
There was a whole thing happening.

13:07.880 --> 13:11.429
I know. But my mom came by today
and apologized to me and my dad...

13:11.600 --> 13:14.194
...and it seems like she's changed.

13:16.880 --> 13:22.193
Hey, if my parents got back together,
and my dad found a job...

13:22.360 --> 13:26.353
...then my life could go
back to normal again.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.671
Maybe I should stay away
for a little while.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.434
First-date stuff: Candy, flowers.
It's easy.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.989
- Candy, flowers. Right.
- But it's times like these...

13:34.160 --> 13:37.675
...when a girl
needs her boyfriend the most.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.790
Boyfriend?

13:40.960 --> 13:44.589
Well, I mean, aren't we...?

13:45.960 --> 13:47.518
L... I guess.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.831
I've just never been a boyfriend before.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.639
- But you've had girlfriends?
- Yeah.

13:53.800 --> 13:58.191
No, not girlfriends,
just girls that, you know...

14:01.000 --> 14:03.753
Your mom. Saturday night.
Can't wait.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.273
Great.

14:08.640 --> 14:12.394
The fact is, yes, I admit it.
I occasionally talk about Summer.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.792
Maybe I even talk about her too much,
but that's not really the point, is it?

14:19.520 --> 14:20.748
Hi.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.719
So get this.

14:24.880 --> 14:29.271
Anna thinks all I ever do
is talk about Summer.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.036
I mean, that's crazy, right?

14:33.200 --> 14:35.430
You want me to lie?

14:37.120 --> 14:39.111
I'm that guy?

14:39.280 --> 14:42.556
Dude, how can I be that guy?
I hate that guy.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.029
No wonder Summer doesn't have
any interest in me...

14:45.200 --> 14:46.997
...because apparently all I do...

14:47.160 --> 14:50.311
...is I talk about Summer.
Although you'd think she'd like that.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.357
- You're doing it again.
- Right.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.429
I'm sorry I had to cancel
our date last night.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.433
- What time did you get home?
- Almost 2.

15:02.600 --> 15:06.912
- What was the last-minute crisis?
- You know I'm not at liberty to say.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.989
Is Rachel's boyfriend
as understanding as I am?

15:12.160 --> 15:14.754
Rachel doesn't have a boyfriend.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.831
Go figure.

15:18.120 --> 15:22.079
Some people who don't like their life
make work their life.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.038
Well, that's not me.

15:25.200 --> 15:29.478
And I'll tell you this, if our settlement
conference goes well today...

15:29.640 --> 15:32.074
...I could be home by 6.

15:32.240 --> 15:35.152
Is that a bribe, counselor?

15:39.360 --> 15:41.078
Hey!

15:45.680 --> 15:50.196
- Did you have the talk?
- No. I like to lead by example.

15:52.520 --> 15:56.274
You and Julie Cooper trapped on a boat?
Can't wait to see how that one goes.

15:56.440 --> 16:00.433
I don't really have a choice,
since she's my girlfriend.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.068
What? Girlfriend?

16:03.240 --> 16:05.151
I thought that you didn't do girlfriends.

16:05.320 --> 16:07.197
Well, you did them, but you,
you know...

16:07.360 --> 16:10.909
I don't, and this is not a good way
to start. At least you'll be there.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.436
I won't. Who'd I bring?
I can't take Summer.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.070
Or I could...
Do you think she'd go? I don't know.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.390
I'm doing it again! Yeah!

16:20.560 --> 16:23.279
You know who you could ask?

16:25.120 --> 16:27.395
I could take a friend. Interesting.

16:29.960 --> 16:33.873
Okay, I'm never gonna mention
Summer's name to you again.

16:34.040 --> 16:38.989
Except for that. From now on, we'll only
discuss things we both have in common.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.720
Like how do you feel
about Newport charity events?

16:41.880 --> 16:43.279
- I hate them.
- Me too.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.510
So, what do you say you come
with me to one...

16:45.680 --> 16:47.557
...and we'll just quietly mock people?

16:51.440 --> 16:55.274
- Is Summer gonna be there?
- I don't know. Who cares?

16:57.880 --> 17:01.589
If anything happens between me
and Summer, you won't hear about it.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.990
I promise. On our friendship.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.751
Okay.

17:10.920 --> 17:14.390
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services'
ecological risk assessment asserts...

17:14.560 --> 17:18.234
...that the land adjacent to the wetlands
should be considered wetlands as well.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.470
Well, why stop there, counselor?

17:20.640 --> 17:23.871
Why not include the land adjacent
to the land adjacent to the wetlands?

17:24.040 --> 17:26.679
Mr. Nichol, I'm sure
your attorney has explained...

17:26.839 --> 17:29.991
...that soon the state will acquire
the land by eminent domain.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.993
It took the state five years
to purchase the Balboa Wetlands.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.912
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

17:35.080 --> 17:39.517
How much is the Land Trust
offering me for Balboa Heights?

17:40.400 --> 17:42.231
Mr. Cohen.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.518
I was beginning to wonder
about your involvement in all of this.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.835
Thank you all for coming.
This meeting is adjourned.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.356
- Where are you going?
- Well, I mean, that's it?

17:56.520 --> 17:59.318
That's your whole dog-and-pony show?

17:59.480 --> 18:02.278
I'm disappointed.
What have you two been doing?

18:02.800 --> 18:06.190
Kiki tells me that you've been
in the office alone together every night...

18:06.360 --> 18:08.191
...till 2 in the morning.

18:09.480 --> 18:13.473
- Feel free to counter, Mr. Nichol.
- Why is she doing all the talking?

18:13.640 --> 18:17.315
Are you just here to ensure that your firm
makes the early edition again?

18:17.800 --> 18:20.951
"Father and son-in-law
fight for the Heights."

18:21.120 --> 18:24.556
Cal, I've dealt with a lot
of shady characters in my work...

18:24.720 --> 18:27.678
...but I've never seen anyone
stoop as low as you.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.957
You'll poison anything, air, water,
even your daughter's marriage...

18:31.120 --> 18:34.795
...as long as you profit.
- You've been living off my profits.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.997
If you think I'm bought and paid for...

18:41.080 --> 18:44.868
...just wait till I get you on the stand.
Don't let my silence here mislead you.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.713
I'm taking you down.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.359
Counselor.

18:56.360 --> 18:59.079
I think I hit a nerve.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.515
- I forgot I had this dress.
- Happens to me all the time.

19:16.680 --> 19:19.831
My mom bought it for me.
It seems appropriate.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.709
I think your mom would understand
if you didn't want to do this.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.996
Except I do.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.469
Right. That's what I meant.

19:29.520 --> 19:34.355
Marissa, this event is important
and on a yacht...

19:34.520 --> 19:37.910
...and whenever I go to these things,
somebody gets into a fight.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.116
You're gonna be fine.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.391
Ryan, hi.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.836
Oh, it's so nice to see you
in your room again.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.629
- You can sleep here tonight, if you want.
- It's okay.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.028
But thanks.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.509
Just thought I'd ask.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.591
Oh, I love this dress.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.479
Remember when we bought it,
we had lunch in Beverly Hills?

20:01.640 --> 20:04.837
- We saw Catherine Zeta-Jones.
- Yeah, I remember.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.558
So much fun.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.869
Well, we should get to the ship and
help out. Will you check on Kaitlin?

20:13.040 --> 20:14.871
Okay, sure.

20:17.120 --> 20:21.910
So I know that you and I
haven't always seen eye to eye...

20:22.920 --> 20:25.639
...but I want to say that I'm sorry.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.997
You've been there for Marissa.
You care about her, I see that now.

20:29.160 --> 20:33.438
And I'm hoping that this party
will be a chance for us to start fresh.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.830
A celebration of a new beginning.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.276
I don't really like boats.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.797
Please?

20:45.720 --> 20:47.073
Okay.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.278
Thank you.

20:52.280 --> 20:53.838
Hey.

20:57.080 --> 20:59.594
Well, let's get to the boat, huh?

21:00.960 --> 21:02.552
Come on.

21:05.320 --> 21:08.835
I can't believe the lit mag won't publish
my limericks. That's censorship.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.274
It's censorship!

21:10.440 --> 21:14.752
- I'll organize a protest immediately.
- Fine, something involving a bra-burning.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.148
Cohen!

21:16.320 --> 21:18.754
- Hey. What are you still doing here?
- Detention.

21:18.920 --> 21:20.433
You live a hard life, Summer.

21:20.600 --> 21:24.229
A Paul Frank sale is more important
than the fall of the Ming Dynasty.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.914
What am I supposed to learn?
That opium is gnarly?

21:27.080 --> 21:30.436
Right.
Because there is no lesson there.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.155
Are you making fun of me? I can't tell.

21:34.320 --> 21:37.790
Most of the time, Summer,
you do my job for me.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.838
Again, not tracking.

21:42.760 --> 21:46.992
So, Cohen, I was wondering if you could
catch me up in history tomorrow.

21:47.160 --> 21:50.550
I can't until Sunday.
I have a charity thing tomorrow.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.109
- The thing for the children's hospital?
- Yeah.

21:53.280 --> 21:56.238
- You're going to that?
- We both are.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.709
- You and her?
- Me and Anna.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.995
Which is my name, by the way.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.039
I'm going too.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.555
Hey. Well, then I'll see you there.

22:08.640 --> 22:12.679
In fact, I'm going with him. Chip!

22:14.040 --> 22:16.235
- Hey.
- All right.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.156
She's going with him?

22:20.120 --> 22:21.599
I don't care.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.309
- There's pot roast in the...
- I ate.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.710
- With Rachel?
- What was that today?

22:35.880 --> 22:39.714
- I'm sorry. He just...
- lf you have a problem, come to me.

22:39.880 --> 22:44.351
You're never here. Who am I gonna
talk to if I don't talk to my dad? Seth?

22:44.520 --> 22:48.149
We're adults with demanding jobs.
You don't go running off to your daddy.

22:48.320 --> 22:51.392
If that's too hard, go give Jimmy a call.

22:51.560 --> 22:54.028
So nice talking to you.

23:00.160 --> 23:02.628
Don't ever get married.

23:03.720 --> 23:08.032
So how's everything going
with your relationship?

23:08.200 --> 23:10.156
Which I need to talk to you about.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.276
Good, I guess. Good.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.908
- It's just hard.
- Really?

23:15.080 --> 23:18.072
Seventeen years later,
it doesn't get any easier.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.831
It's her mom, really.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.116
In-laws.

23:23.280 --> 23:26.590
If you figure it out, let me know.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.277
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.388
Thanks.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.797
Good evening.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.468
I'll call you.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.956
- Hey.
- Hi.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.551
Just got to get my good pair of shoes.

24:17.960 --> 24:20.838
I know this isn't exactly
the date you had planned...

24:21.000 --> 24:23.309
...but I really appreciate it.

24:23.480 --> 24:26.358
You couldn't have done better
with my mom yesterday.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.114
She's like a different person.

24:31.160 --> 24:35.438
Who knows? Maybe if everything
goes well tonight, then...

24:39.120 --> 24:41.634
I'm really happy.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.837
Which never used to be
an accomplishment.

24:45.920 --> 24:49.674
- And not just about my parents.
- We're gonna be late.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.391
- Yo.
- What up, homes?

24:56.560 --> 24:58.152
- Chilling.
- All right.

25:03.640 --> 25:06.108
- What's that smell?
- Perfume.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.919
It smells like wood chips.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.799
In a rose garden, roses.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.918
So this is your crib.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.597
This is where all the magic happens?

25:17.760 --> 25:20.991
If by "magic" you're referring to
the card game, then sadly, yes.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.594
You have a hot tub. Ever use it?

25:23.760 --> 25:26.991
Hot tub's for the ho's.
I usually hang in the grotto.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.677
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

25:29.840 --> 25:32.877
- I'm just gonna run to the girls' room.
- I gotta go too.

25:33.040 --> 25:36.112
Right. Because girls can't be alone.

25:38.560 --> 25:42.189
What? It's Anna. I could've said "pop
a squat" in front of her if I wanted to.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.157
Sometimes you talk just to make sounds.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.072
Sometimes I do.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.832
So Anna looks good.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.959
Tonight should be fun.
There's gonna be a raffle.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.918
The only thing more fun
than a raffle is anything, really.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.548
- You guys ready?
- The girls are peeing.

25:57.720 --> 26:01.030
- Seth, don't say "pee."
- Where's Sandy?

26:01.200 --> 26:02.553
Don't ask.

26:03.840 --> 26:07.150
- Question.
- Hey. Early-bird special.

26:07.320 --> 26:10.676
I'm gonna soldier on. Trying to get
out of here at a decent hour.

26:10.840 --> 26:15.868
Right. Not all of us have
cocktail parties to go to on yachts.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.718
Right.

26:22.360 --> 26:26.273
So Caleb won't sell.
No surprise there. On to plan B.

26:26.440 --> 26:29.079
- What's plan B?
- I'm working on it.

26:29.240 --> 26:32.915
Come to the floor, Sandy. Everything
makes more sense on the floor.

26:33.080 --> 26:34.877
We've got pad thai on the floor.

26:35.040 --> 26:38.510
- We got work to do.
- Which is why we must refuel.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.636
You got any dumplings?

26:41.320 --> 26:43.356
I'm powerless before dumplings.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.590
Go with gravity, man.

27:02.680 --> 27:06.753
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you. Nice to see you.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.638
- Hi, you're here!
- Hey, Mom.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.308
- How are you doing?
- Good.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.277
- Hi.
- Hi, Kaitlin.

27:12.440 --> 27:13.668
Hi, Ryan.

27:15.120 --> 27:18.795
Kaitlin doesn't trust new people,
but Ryan is very trustworthy.

27:19.800 --> 27:23.110
Marissa, Reverend Donahue
wants to say hello.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.554
Okay, Daddy.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.634
- Can I get a photo of the Cooper family?
- Totally, yes.

27:28.800 --> 27:31.473
- Come on, let's do it. Jules?
- Yes, of course.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.154
<i>Riviera Magazine</i>. It's very exciting.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.515
Ryan, why don't you join us?

27:36.680 --> 27:39.797
No. It's for your family.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.757
Say "cheese!"

27:43.240 --> 27:44.878
I didn't say "cheese."

27:45.040 --> 27:47.600
- Hey, Kiki.
- Hey, Dad.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.030
Where's the Sandman?

27:51.200 --> 27:55.432
- Those earrings are hypnotizing me.
- They're making me seasick.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.632
There he is, built like a pipe cleaner
but looking sharp.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.711
Same to you.
I don't know what that means.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.474
- Who's this little firecracker?
- It's my date.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.393
My friend Anna.

28:07.560 --> 28:10.313
- Clearly, she needs no introduction.
- Nice to meet you.

28:10.480 --> 28:14.268
Seth said you were scary,
but I see an inner sweetness.

28:14.440 --> 28:17.830
- I like your moxie.
- Suddenly we're in a film noir.

28:18.280 --> 28:21.955
The ocean is, like, so vast.
Like, endless.

28:22.120 --> 28:25.510
- I feel so...
- Insignificant?

28:25.680 --> 28:26.908
Go figure.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.389
You know, I'm thirsty.

28:29.560 --> 28:33.394
- Do you want to go to the bar?
- Yeah, you can. Thanks.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.515
You must have met Seth before.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.237
Excuse me.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.638
Hi, Ryan.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.399
- Good party.
- Thank you.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.675
And thanks for not telling Marissa.

29:00.840 --> 29:04.719
She's excited about you maybe
getting back together with her dad.

29:05.920 --> 29:09.469
You may be okay
with lying to Marissa, but not me.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.471
This is my life. My daughter.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.710
My girlfriend.

29:13.880 --> 29:19.113
Ryan, stay out of this.
It's none of your business.

29:29.640 --> 29:31.949
Hey, how goes it with Chip?

29:32.120 --> 29:35.954
He's surprised that the ocean is big.
Smoke another beer, Chip.

29:36.120 --> 29:38.031
Wow, someone's in a good mood.

29:38.200 --> 29:41.237
What is Seth Cohen doing
with Tinker Bell? She's from Pittsburgh.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.038
That's like the 909 of the East.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.555
- Anna's cool.
- She's a little scammer.

29:45.720 --> 29:48.518
First thing she does
is go after Caleb Nichol's grandson!

29:48.680 --> 29:50.477
Have you seen the way
she looks at him?

29:50.640 --> 29:55.077
- No, but clearly you have.
- Only because it's, like, totally obvious.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.549
Yes, it is, that you're jealous.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.915
- You like Seth Cohen.
- No!

30:00.080 --> 30:03.629
- You like him. Like him. Love him.
- Stop it!

30:03.800 --> 30:06.394
Stop! I do not like Seth Cohen.

30:06.560 --> 30:09.597
I can't like Seth Cohen.
He's, like, Seth Cohen.

30:09.760 --> 30:13.230
Well, it's too bad, because he likes you.

30:23.640 --> 30:25.073
Hey.

30:26.440 --> 30:29.318
My parents are totally getting along.

30:29.480 --> 30:32.597
If my dad finds a job soon,
I can be your neighbor again.

30:32.760 --> 30:36.036
- I could sneak over whenever.
- Parents are weird.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.430
I wouldn't count on anything.

30:38.600 --> 30:41.433
Right. You wouldn't.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.831
What's that mean?

30:45.000 --> 30:47.434
If you don't understand
how important this is...

30:47.600 --> 30:49.352
I get it.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.476
I get it, okay?

30:51.640 --> 30:53.710
Too well. My mom, my dad...

30:53.880 --> 30:57.270
Just because that happened to you,
doesn't mean it'll happen to me.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.432
- My parents may get back together.
- No.

31:01.080 --> 31:03.036
They won't.

31:03.200 --> 31:06.192
Why can't you just be happy for me?

31:07.240 --> 31:10.835
- Your mom is seeing Caleb Nichol.
- What? What are you talking about?

31:11.000 --> 31:14.436
I saw them together
in front of your house.

31:17.080 --> 31:18.559
I'm sorry.

31:29.400 --> 31:32.517
At this point, we go to the state
for Proposition 50 funds...

31:32.680 --> 31:35.672
...and hope they've got
a spare $200 million in the budget.

31:35.840 --> 31:38.991
Wait. I have the budget
here somewhere.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.231
It's with the Fish and Wildlife stuff.

31:43.400 --> 31:46.790
No, you put it
with the Land Trust documents.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.031
Feels like Twister.

31:50.200 --> 31:54.557
When I was in college,
that game got me in a lot of trouble.

31:54.720 --> 31:56.631
I can imagine.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.794
However, you and I
are in enough trouble as it is.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.313
Yeah.

32:01.480 --> 32:06.110
Was it me, or did your father-in-law
basically accuse us of having an affair?

32:07.120 --> 32:09.634
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.189
Where'd he get that idea, right?

32:12.360 --> 32:18.435
I mean, we work together,
and we eat all our meals together.

32:20.440 --> 32:24.991
We talk on the phone
when we can't actually be together.

32:32.640 --> 32:35.677
I got a boat to catch.

32:57.720 --> 32:59.756
Oh, goodness.
Look at that piece right there.

32:59.920 --> 33:02.718
Get a northeasterly breeze,
that toupee's gonna go overboard.

33:02.880 --> 33:06.077
Good thing his wife has surgically
enhanced flotation devices.

33:06.240 --> 33:10.028
- Then she can jump in after it.
- Yeah, and they're also fun to look at.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.794
Do me a favor and go tell
that kid puberty started.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.872
I don't think the pencil-thin mustache
is gonna make a comeback.

33:16.040 --> 33:17.951
Hey, dude, embrace the razor.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.395
Sounds like you're speaking
from experience.

33:20.560 --> 33:24.109
Maybe when I was 13,
my nickname used to be Magnum, P.I.

33:24.280 --> 33:27.590
- Really?
- Yeah. Mothers can be so cruel.

33:30.440 --> 33:34.274
God, there are not people
like this in Pittsburgh.

33:34.440 --> 33:38.911
- You must hate Newport.
- I did. At first.

33:39.080 --> 33:42.470
But now it's growing on me.

33:48.240 --> 33:51.710
Are you thirsty at all?
I'm feeling a little parched.

33:51.880 --> 33:55.077
I think I'm gonna get a couple
of Mountain Dews to take the edge off.

33:55.240 --> 33:58.312
- Sure.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.231
Wow. Check it out.

34:03.400 --> 34:06.597
It's, like, totally dark but totally visual.

34:06.760 --> 34:09.831
Yeah. Not understanding a word
you're saying.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.560
Finish 'shrooming.
I'm gonna go get a drink.

34:12.719 --> 34:16.838
Excuse me. I hate to interrupt.
Just a moment of your time.

34:18.040 --> 34:22.591
I'm Julie Cooper, the coordinator
of this event. Thank you all for coming.

34:22.760 --> 34:26.992
Through your generous contributions,
we've raised almost $200,000...

34:27.159 --> 34:29.469
...for the children's hospital.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.510
And don't forget, it's tax-deductible.

34:33.320 --> 34:36.118
- Can we talk?
- Yeah. Okay.

34:39.679 --> 34:42.274
I have to say that
we could not have done any of this...

34:42.440 --> 34:44.670
...without Caleb Nichol.
- Let's get out of here.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.909
I should leave and let her
get away with this?

34:47.080 --> 34:49.036
Let's give him a big hand.

34:49.199 --> 34:51.190
Is that what you would do?

34:52.120 --> 34:53.712
Hi.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.076
Oh, God! No.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.198
What's happening here?

35:09.320 --> 35:11.550
I like Seth Cohen.

35:11.720 --> 35:13.199
You...? You what now?

35:13.360 --> 35:15.112
Nothing. I wasn't talking to you.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.590
But if you tell anyone
what you heard here, I'll kill you.

35:22.720 --> 35:26.156
There's my beautiful daughter,
Marissa. Please join us.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.350
Come join us, honey.

35:35.240 --> 35:38.152
Thank you. Now my daughter
Kaitlin will pick the winner...

35:38.320 --> 35:40.550
...of the romantic getaway raffle.

35:40.720 --> 35:43.632
Marissa, would you like to
announce the lucky couple?

35:43.800 --> 35:45.313
Thanks.

35:45.480 --> 35:48.870
And how about another round
of applause for my mom?

35:50.760 --> 35:52.876
And for Caleb Nichol.

35:54.680 --> 35:57.478
After all their work
on behalf of the children's hospital...

35:57.640 --> 36:00.871
...if anybody deserves
a romantic getaway for two...

36:01.040 --> 36:03.679
...it's my mom and Caleb Nichol.

36:04.120 --> 36:08.079
I mean, aren't they
just the perfect couple?

36:08.240 --> 36:11.073
They've been keeping
their romance a secret...

36:11.240 --> 36:15.279
...but tonight, the secret's out.

36:17.760 --> 36:20.115
Congratulations, you guys.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.916
Honey, take this.

36:39.080 --> 36:42.868
- Don't start with me.
- After tonight, I'm done with you.

36:43.040 --> 36:46.032
- You're Caleb's problem now.
- Jimmy...

36:46.760 --> 36:48.432
One more, please.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.795
Excuse me.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.633
And the winner of tonight's raffle is...

36:53.800 --> 36:56.951
...Sandy and Kirsten Cohen.

37:01.960 --> 37:04.599
- What the hell was that?
- You lied to me.

37:04.760 --> 37:08.196
- You said you wanted us to be a family.
- I do.

37:08.360 --> 37:11.636
I was going to tell you,
but this is all so new.

37:11.800 --> 37:14.598
I know you've been through so much.
Marissa, honey...

37:14.760 --> 37:19.117
...this whole party was to show you
that our life could be like it was.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.669
You could move back home.
We could be a family again.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.513
And what about dad?

37:24.680 --> 37:29.356
Honey, I will always love your father.

37:30.560 --> 37:33.358
But because of what he's done,
we have no future together.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.397
Neither do we.

37:41.800 --> 37:44.075
Wait. Okay. What?

37:44.240 --> 37:46.754
Julie Cooper and my grandfather?

37:47.720 --> 37:51.838
If that worked out,
then Marissa would be my aunt.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.389
I can't believe
you missed all the excitement.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.676
Where have you been?

37:56.840 --> 38:00.833
I find raffles to be extremely upsetting.
There's too much suspense.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.918
I don't go.

38:12.200 --> 38:16.716
I trusted you. I told you things
about my life and my marriage.

38:16.880 --> 38:19.235
And you used them against me.

38:19.400 --> 38:22.233
And you tell me nothing about you.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.759
If this is the way you're gonna react...

38:26.920 --> 38:28.717
...do you blame me?

38:29.520 --> 38:30.748
No.

38:30.920 --> 38:33.718
In fact,
outside the office from now on...

38:33.880 --> 38:36.917
...we have nothing to say to each other.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.152
Oh, and good luck
with your new girlfriend.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.117
You're gonna need it.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.475
- I'm here.
- We're leaving.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.232
But I wore a jacket.

38:56.360 --> 38:59.113
I think this party's over.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.388
Want me to take you back to your dad's?

39:04.400 --> 39:07.392
I think I'm ready for our first date.

39:09.240 --> 39:12.676
I think we're way past that now.

39:14.320 --> 39:18.029
So in theory, Julie Cooper
could become your stepmother?

39:18.200 --> 39:19.952
Don't even say it.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.918
- I'm late to one event, I miss everything.
- Not everything.

39:23.080 --> 39:26.595
We won the raffle.
A romantic getaway for two.

39:26.760 --> 39:30.594
- Lf you can get away from the office.
- Yeah. It'll be good for us.

39:30.760 --> 39:34.435
- Spend a little time alone.
- Glad to hear it.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.511
So, what are you doing now?

39:39.560 --> 39:40.993
You.

39:42.520 --> 39:44.431
Glad to hear it.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.309
This is a pretty good date.

40:11.480 --> 40:14.916
- I just wish it didn't have to end.
- It doesn't.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.957
Spend the night.

40:19.720 --> 40:23.235
We don't have to do anything.
We could sleep.

40:24.360 --> 40:27.033
Really? Sandy and Kirsten
are cool with that?

40:27.200 --> 40:30.272
Well, I haven't had the talk yet, so...

40:32.800 --> 40:34.552
Do you snore?

40:34.720 --> 40:36.039
No.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.191
Well, I don't think so.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.318
I've never actually
slept with someone before.

40:41.480 --> 40:45.553
Me neither. I'm usually climbing out
the window or back into the front seat.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.996
- Okay, enough sharing.
- Yeah.

40:49.160 --> 40:50.752
Good night.

40:58.720 --> 41:01.188
I thought you said you wanted to sleep.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.874
Suddenly not so tired.

41:07.520 --> 41:08.748
Best...

41:10.280 --> 41:12.157
...date...

41:12.320 --> 41:14.117
...ever.
