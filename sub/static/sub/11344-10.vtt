(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:02.336 --> 00:06.540
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.110
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.143 --> 00:10.744
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.778 --> 00:12.380
are members of an elite squad

00:12.413 --> 00:14.315
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.784
These are their stories.

00:17.785 --> 00:21.522
[carousel music playing]

00:21.555 --> 00:23.424
Tasha, hold on tight
to your sister.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.526
Smile for daddy.

00:25.559 --> 00:26.794
(woman)
Your girls are beautiful.

00:26.827 --> 00:30.498
Thanks. It's their
first time here.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.301
[bell rings]

00:33.334 --> 00:37.671
Timmy! Don't get off
until it stops!

00:56.257 --> 00:58.392
Tasha? Nicki?

01:06.400 --> 01:08.802
[chuckles]
Look, girls,
don't play games.

01:08.836 --> 01:11.639
Girls, where are you?

01:17.811 --> 01:19.813
Girls!

01:29.157 --> 01:30.791
Hurry, Nicki!

01:36.864 --> 01:39.867
Tasha!
You stop right now!

01:43.804 --> 01:46.740
Tasha!
Wait, please.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.477
[horn honks]

01:55.716 --> 01:57.751
Someone call 911!

01:57.785 --> 02:00.654
I didn't see her! I swear
to God I didn't see her.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.659
Tasha!

02:05.693 --> 02:07.695
You her dad?

02:07.728 --> 02:08.762
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.798
Let's go.
I'm sorry.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.733
Tasha!

02:12.766 --> 02:13.734
Hey, mister,

02:13.767 --> 02:15.436
where you going?

02:21.609 --> 02:23.711
Two girls.
Tasha and Lola Wright.

02:23.744 --> 02:24.845
Hit by a cab.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.515
Driver saw dad fleeing
the scene with another daughter.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.817
What kind of father runs
out on his injured kids?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.319
Maybe one with
an open warrant.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.453
Doesn't want
to get picked up.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.721
How are the girls?

02:33.754 --> 02:35.289
Tasha the 12-year-old's
got a concussion.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.890
A couple of scrapes
and bruises.

02:36.924 --> 02:37.958
She cushioned
baby Lola's fall.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.394
Little one's got
no injuries.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.930
Okay. Thanks.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.965
Hey, Tasha.
My name's Olivia.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.335
This is Elliot.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.670
I want to help you
find your dad.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.439
He's not my father.
My dad's a soldier.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.740
He died in Iraq.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.876
Then who was the man
in the park?

02:55.909 --> 02:58.646
I don't know his name.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.582
Why were you there
with him?

03:01.615 --> 03:03.684
He took us
from New Orleans.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.853
The water flooded
our house.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.821
Mama and Grandma drowned.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.290
Hurricane Katrina.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.792
(Tasha)
We held onto the roof.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.995
The man came in a boat.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.965
He saved our lives.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.701
He said he was
our new daddy.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.670
Then he brought you
to New York.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.572
He said he'd take
care of us.

03:24.605 --> 03:25.806
That we were his girls now.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.308
Where are
you staying?

03:27.341 --> 03:29.410
In a basement.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.812
We never went outside
before today.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.914
Has he ever hurt you?
No.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.449
But he looks
at me funny.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.418
And he's always
hugging Nicki.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.820
Has he ever hurt Nicki?

03:41.789 --> 03:43.657
Not until last night.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.696
He made her sleep
in his bed.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.768
I heard her crying.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.240
Please save my sister.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.965
When do I get
to see my sister?

04:57.998 --> 04:59.633
Well, we're gonna talk
a little bit first,

04:59.667 --> 05:00.934
and then we'll take you
to see Lola.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.936
Hey, John.
This is Tasha Wright.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.705
John's gonna get you
settled, okay?

05:04.738 --> 05:06.840
Come on.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.776
The perp has got to know
that we're talking to Tasha.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.911
He could panic
and kill the sister.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.045
He's got nothing
to worry about.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.482
He knows Tasha doesn't know
his name or where he lives.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.816
He can just stay put
and keep abusing Nicki.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.718
Olivia,
Morales wants you

05:17.751 --> 05:18.786
to review
the geographic cues

05:18.819 --> 05:19.787
before you start

05:19.820 --> 05:21.822
interviewing Tasha.

05:21.855 --> 05:22.890
Hey, I checked

05:22.923 --> 05:24.958
with the Center for Missing
and Exploited Children.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.795
2,300 kids missing
since Katrina.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.796
The Wright girls
aren't on the list.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.863
Well, the parents
are dead.

05:29.897 --> 05:30.898
Relatives scattered
in shelters.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.933
They're perfect prey
for a pedophile.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.402
And there's lots of them.

05:34.435 --> 05:37.471
4,500 sex offenders
disappeared after Katrina.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.739
There's no telling how many
kids they've taken.

05:38.772 --> 05:39.873
Like the hundreds of kids

05:39.907 --> 05:41.442
who were snatched
after the tsunami.

05:41.475 --> 05:44.645
Those pervs are ghosts
until they hit again.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.514
No one knows your past.
You can start a new life.

05:46.547 --> 05:47.848
Abuse more children.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.783
I bet they can't
believe their luck.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.952
Come here.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.821
Captain, hospital called.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.756
Tasha and Lola's rape
kits, they're negative.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.958
I'm not surprised.
Nicki's the right age.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.893
Pedophiles usually go
for prepubescent girls.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.762
So why abduct all three?

06:01.795 --> 06:03.431
He did tell them
to call him "daddy."

06:03.464 --> 06:04.665
Maybe he's living
some kind of fantasy.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.100
Devoted father of
three beautiful daughters.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.536
But Tasha didn't
fall for it.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.603
Soon as he moves in
on Nicki,

06:09.637 --> 06:10.838
Tasha runs away.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.574
Which probably
pissed him off.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.075
Nicki's in
a lot of danger.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.877
(Morales)
Olivia's set
with her earpiece.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.446
We're good to go.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.783
[over intercom]
Hey, sweetie.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.885
Okay. So, Tasha.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.554
Tell me how you got
to the park.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.656
(Tasha)
We took the bus.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.459
Was it a short ride
or a long ride?

06:31.492 --> 06:32.760
About an hour.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.027
That's too far for a trip

06:34.061 --> 06:35.596
from the East
or West Side.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.798
They must've come from south
of the park or uptown.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.036
Hour's bus ride gives us
everything between

06:43.070 --> 06:44.905
North Harlem
and the Village.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.206
Ask about
the architecture.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.075
So when you were
at the bus stop today,

06:48.108 --> 06:49.443
what did you see?

06:51.479 --> 06:52.846
Lots of buildings.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.483
Can you tell me
what they looked like?

06:55.516 --> 06:58.051
Some were tall.
Some were little.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.453
And brown with big stairs.

06:59.487 --> 07:02.122
Brownstones. Not a lot
of those downtown.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.591
Gotta be Harlem.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.961
(Benson)
Does the man live
in one of the brown ones?

07:07.995 --> 07:10.798
Yeah. We lived
under the stairs.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.800
So, Tasha, when you were
outside the house today

07:12.833 --> 07:14.001
what did you see?

07:15.803 --> 07:18.772
A church. I asked the man
if we could go there.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.974
Mama always takes us
to church on Sunday.

07:21.008 --> 07:24.712
And what else
was near the house?

07:24.745 --> 07:26.013
A school.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.048
Okay. Can you
describe it for me?

07:28.081 --> 07:29.850
I never saw it.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.152
I just heard the bells
and kids playing.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.923
There are hundreds
of churches in Harlem.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.625
Dozens of schools.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.093
That target area will
take us days to canvass.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.095
Nicki doesn't have
that much time.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.933
We gotta jog
Tasha's memory.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.802
Get her on the street.
Start with the churches.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.240
(Benson)
Tasha, does it look
like this?

07:53.273 --> 07:56.143
Too old.
It was newer.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.846
What about this one?

07:58.879 --> 08:00.848
It's kind of the same.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.950
But it didn't have
stained glass.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.154
(Tasha)
Not this one.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.891
This isn't working.

08:10.924 --> 08:11.925
They gotta keep going.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.226
The next church
could be the one.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.295
And the next minute
Nicki could be dead.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.665
(Tasha)
No, not this one.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.600
No.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.301
Okay. Come on.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.036
No.

08:25.773 --> 08:26.974
They've been out there
for five hours.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.208
This is a waste of time.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.177
You've got a better idea?

08:31.979 --> 08:33.280
We're never
gonna find her.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.917
Yeah, we will, honey.
We just gotta keep looking.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.686
We struck out.
Need the next location.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.655
(Cragen)
Pack it in.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.223
Captain,
we can't quit now.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.727
Bring Tasha back to the house.
We've got a new plan.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.328
We're going to the media.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.163
Public appeal
on the TV news.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.299
Great idea. Kidnapper
sees that, Nicki's dead.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.167
Not if we report
an unidentified girl

08:54.201 --> 08:55.769
was hit by a taxi.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.204
She's in a coma.
We're looking for her family.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.206
Captain, even if the perp
doesn't get raised up,

08:59.239 --> 09:00.574
what do we get out of it?

09:00.608 --> 09:02.776
Pictures. We ask
everybody at the carousel

09:02.810 --> 09:04.144
to give us their film.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.313
Maybe we get a photo
of the perp that Tasha can I.D.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.616
You're counting on the press
to run a fake story?

09:08.649 --> 09:10.017
We won't tell 'em
it's fake.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.552
DCPI has got the press
conference set up.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.156
We're gonna need
a picture of Tasha.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.792
A real heartbreaker.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.761
(Cragen)
If you were
at the carousel today,

09:20.794 --> 09:24.097
please contact our office
at the number on your screen.

09:24.131 --> 09:28.035
We'll send an officer to borrow
your photographs and video.

09:28.068 --> 09:31.104
Please help us to find
this little girl's family.

09:31.138 --> 09:34.207
She may not make it and her
parents should be with her.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.877
Thank you.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.980
He's laying it on
with a trowel.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.181
Excuse me?

09:41.214 --> 09:43.183
Jackson Zane.
From The Ledger.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.852
I just got handed
the police beat.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.219
Pretty cynical
for a new guy.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.989
I'm new, not naive.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.825
Cute kid.
Tragic accident.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.160
Whole dog and pony show

09:53.193 --> 09:56.229
just in time
for the 11:00 news.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.130
What's the real story?

09:57.164 --> 09:59.166
Just what
my captain said.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.634
Need to find
the girl's parents.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.135
Hmm. Nobody got home
from the park

10:02.169 --> 10:05.138
and realized they were
short a kid?

10:05.172 --> 10:07.140
I guess not.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.276
You could cut me a break.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.779
Make me look good
to my new boss.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.113
But then my boss would

10:13.146 --> 10:15.215
ship me out
to Sheepshead Bay.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.051
What are you really
looking for, detective?

10:18.085 --> 10:20.153
Carousel photos.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.858
I got your page. You've
been working all night?

10:24.892 --> 10:26.727
Yeah, but it was worth it.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.961
Dozens of
family photos came in.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.963
Then we hit
the jackpot. Video.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.231
Hey.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.703
Lady was filming
her kid on the carousel.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.138
We got a full 360
of the crowd.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.373
And a lot of the kids.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.745
(Benson)
Pause it.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.747
That's Lola, Tasha.

10:46.780 --> 10:47.981
And that's gotta be Nicki.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.817
Dirtbag's in here
somewhere.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.719
Morning.
We didn't have time

10:51.752 --> 10:53.053
to get her dressed
at the children's center.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.321
I'm sleepy.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.455
Oh, sweetheart,
I know you are.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.457
But come here. I want you
to have a seat

10:57.490 --> 10:58.926
and take a really
good look

10:58.959 --> 11:00.393
and see if you can
find the man, okay?

11:00.427 --> 11:02.029
Come on.

11:07.467 --> 11:08.668
There.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.406
It's him.

11:13.440 --> 11:17.344
Okay. Find all
the shots he's in.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.712
I'll put 'em on a disk

11:18.746 --> 11:20.280
in case you need
to print copies later.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.348
Fin will bring in
the taxi driver.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.415
His ID will
corroborate Tasha's.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.951
(Munch)
Put down the camera.

11:23.984 --> 11:24.985
(Zane)
You can't cover
this up!

11:25.018 --> 11:26.419
Put down the camera.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.387
You lied to me.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.488
Throw his ass in the cage.
Give me the camera.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.457
A source at the hospital
said the girl left with you.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.726
It's gonna make
a great headline...

11:32.760 --> 11:33.794
"NYPD Fakes
Coma Girl Tragedy."

11:33.827 --> 11:36.496
Hold on. Let him go.
Don't do this.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.398
You've got nothing coming.
I'm running the story.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.432
You're risking
a child's life.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.835
Yesterday you said
she was dying.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.370
Why should
I believe you now?

11:43.403 --> 11:44.371
Because we'll give you
an exclusive

11:44.404 --> 11:45.472
on an even bigger story.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.240
Bigger than the one
I just got?

11:47.274 --> 11:49.810
Pulitzer material.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.445
Screw me over and I will
spend the rest of my career

11:52.479 --> 11:53.914
crawling so far
up your asses--

11:53.947 --> 11:55.715
Well, we wouldn't
want that.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.988
Early edition deadline
is at 11:00 p.m.

12:01.021 --> 12:04.191
You call me by 9:00
or "Coma Girl" runs.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.963
We're gonna need
a couple hundred copies

12:09.997 --> 12:11.832
of the perp's photo.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.201
Plus enough bodies to canvass
every brownstone in Harlem.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.502
I got something else
you should check out.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.137
I called FEMA.
There's only one

12:17.170 --> 12:19.840
Katrina relief center
in New York City.

12:19.873 --> 12:23.076
FEMA's $2,000 debit card
is pretty hard to pass up.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.481
(Felicity)
More than 4,000 people
displaced by Katrina

12:28.515 --> 12:30.083
have come to New York.
And we're helping

12:30.117 --> 12:31.218
everyone who walks
through the door.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.285
Did you help him?

12:34.454 --> 12:38.125
Yes. I recognize the denim
jacket he's wearing.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.292
It was my husband's.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.994
I brought it in
for the clothing drive.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.796
Do you remember
his name?

12:42.830 --> 12:45.265
Norman. Forman.
Something like that.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.334
I'll check my files.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.837
He was a lovely man.

12:49.870 --> 12:53.273
He just asked for food,
clothing, and job referrals.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.508
He refused FEMA funds.
He didn't want charity.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.544
He didn't want to give out
his social security number.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.813
Did he request housing?

12:59.847 --> 13:01.514
I think he was staying
with friends.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.251
Here it is.
Clark Corman.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.186
You have an address?

13:06.219 --> 13:09.489
No. But we did give him
a prepaid cell phone

13:09.522 --> 13:11.825
to help him find work.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.526
So call him.
Tell him to come down.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.829
What should I say
if he asks why?

13:15.863 --> 13:18.899
Just tell him that you've got
a great job for him.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.168
Handyman
at a youth center.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.904
Munch ran the name
Clark Corman through NCIC

13:23.937 --> 13:25.572
and all the Louisiana
databases. Nothing.

13:25.605 --> 13:26.539
Probably an alias.

13:26.573 --> 13:27.908
Anything on the canvass?

13:27.941 --> 13:30.177
Not yet.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.913
(Stabler)
There he is.

13:32.946 --> 13:33.780
(Benson)
No Nicki.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.182
All right.
We'll follow him home.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.449
How about I go in?

13:36.483 --> 13:37.517
I say I'm from
the youth center.

13:37.550 --> 13:38.852
Get his address.

13:38.886 --> 13:39.887
All right. Call me.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.889
We'll check
his place out.

13:55.568 --> 13:59.006
Detective. I need
to talk to you.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.573
My editor wants me
to stay on your tail

14:00.607 --> 14:01.641
till I get
that exclusive.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.911
Go away.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.282
Oh, son of a bitch.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.625
Police! Corman,
hands on the railing.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.628
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
Hands on the railing.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.296
Where's the girl?

14:23.330 --> 14:24.932
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.034
Sure you don't, Daddy.
Now where's Nicki?

14:27.067 --> 14:29.369
I don't know any Nicki.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.974
You have no idea
what you've done.

14:46.286 --> 14:49.957
Hey. I'm sorry.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.292
You blew our surveillance
on a child abductor.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.227
An eight-year-old girl
is out there somewhere,

14:54.261 --> 14:55.929
maybe dying
because of you.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.664
I thought you were
gaming me. What can I do?

14:57.697 --> 15:01.134
Pray that he talks.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.669
You've made a mistake.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.571
God hasn't blessed me
with children.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.039
So why'd you take
girls' clothing

15:06.073 --> 15:07.274
from Hurricane Help?

15:07.307 --> 15:10.243
Those good folks must have me
confused with someone else.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.279
So many of us lost
everything we owned.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.414
Where have you been
staying in New York?

15:14.447 --> 15:17.951
I don't really see
how that concerns you.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.453
Hmph. Hey.

15:20.487 --> 15:23.223
You're starting to sweat.
You nervous?

15:23.256 --> 15:25.325
Hardly.
Hmm.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.227
I've been through hell.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.163
Clung to a tree all night
while bodies floated by.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.632
You don't scare me.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.968
I know my rights.

15:35.002 --> 15:40.073
I've committed no crime.
You can't keep me here.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.242
I'd like to see
my lawyer now.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.547
He said the magic words.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.182
And while we wait
for Legal Aid

15:49.216 --> 15:50.450
to waltz Mr. Corman
out the door,

15:50.483 --> 15:52.085
God only knows
where Nicki is

15:52.119 --> 15:53.286
or what shape she's in.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.654
Do you think
she's still alive?

15:54.687 --> 15:56.023
He's antsy.
He's sweating.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.158
If he'd hidden the body,
he'd be calm.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.660
Casey, you've gotta
help us out here

16:00.693 --> 16:02.429
'cause I'm not cutting
this guy loose.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.397
Print him.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.735
Counselor,
without grounds to arrest

16:08.768 --> 16:11.204
we need a court order
to compel his fingerprints.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.540
Do you think
he's knows that?

16:13.573 --> 16:15.275
(Benson)
Nicki's alone.
She could be hurt.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.277
Why's it taking so long
to get the prints back?

16:17.310 --> 16:18.311
Well, New Orleans'
court system

16:18.345 --> 16:19.712
was annihilated
by Katrina.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.381
Files lost.
Evidence destroyed.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.782
It's total chaos.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.684
Got 'em. Corman's real
name is Alvin Dutch.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.519
He did a hard ten
in Angola for kiddie rape.

16:26.553 --> 16:29.022
He got out six months ago.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.423
He's listed as a high risk
sex-offender.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.192
And parole lost track
of him in the flood.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.226
The guy I spoke to says

16:33.260 --> 16:34.227
they've been
kicking down doors

16:34.261 --> 16:36.629
looking for him
and 270 other most wanteds.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.165
They find any so far?

16:38.198 --> 16:40.233
Seven in a shelter
on Cape Cod.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.369
Does Mr. Dutch have any
family or friends up here?

16:42.402 --> 16:43.703
None that
they know about.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.306
Child molestation is
a capital offense in Louisiana.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.707
I'm gonna call the DA
down there.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.077
Start working a deal.
He gives us Nicki.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.678
He dodges the needle.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.047
(Cragen)
Get Tasha ready
for a line up.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.448
Your prisoner's
really sick.

16:58.151 --> 17:01.388
He's got a high fever.
EMS on the way?

17:01.421 --> 17:02.455
They should be here
in a minute.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.590
His breathing's shallow.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.258
What's wrong with him?
Is he faking?

17:05.292 --> 17:07.294
Not with a fever
like this.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.296
35-year-old male with
acute onset of fever

17:09.329 --> 17:10.397
and respiratory distress.

17:10.430 --> 17:13.100
He's diaphoretic
and tachycardic.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.135
Start him on O2,
five liters.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.738
Oh! We've gotta
move him now.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.574
One, two, three.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.484
(Benson)
How is he?

17:31.518 --> 17:33.720
Decompensated.
Going into shock.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.555
Look. It's been 12 hours
since we picked him up.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.124
That little girl could
be running out of air.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.125
We've gotta talk to him.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.293
You can't.
He's unconscious.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.362
He was fine 12 hours ago.
What happened?

17:42.395 --> 17:44.164
I don't know.
We're running tests.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.432
I'll page you as soon
as he's lucid.

17:47.434 --> 17:48.768
I'll wait.
Why don't you go back?

17:48.801 --> 17:50.237
I want to be here
when he comes to.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.105
I'll see what I can
find on Alvin Dutch.

17:54.307 --> 17:58.378
Olivia. Your captain
filled me in.

17:58.411 --> 18:02.449
I think I can help.
How?

18:02.482 --> 18:03.783
I ran Alvin Dutch's name
past a buddy of mine

18:03.816 --> 18:05.318
at The Ledger's
New Orleans bureau.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.886
He found one of Dutch's
old cellmates

18:06.919 --> 18:09.156
at a shelter
in Baton Rouge.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.390
Thanks. I'll have

18:10.423 --> 18:12.192
the Louisiana State Police
interview him for us.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.594
I thought you'd rather
do it yourself.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.463
I had him brought
to the wire service.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.631
I got you
a teleconference hookup.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.267
(Benson)
Clayton, did Alvin Dutch

18:20.300 --> 18:21.668
ever talk to you
about his family?

18:21.701 --> 18:24.337
Only to cuss 'em out
for cutting him off.

18:24.371 --> 18:25.405
What about here
in New York City?

18:25.438 --> 18:26.673
He ever mention
knowing anyone?

18:26.706 --> 18:28.875
Yeah.
Come to think of it.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.477
You want
to give us a name?

18:30.510 --> 18:31.911
What's in it for me?

18:31.944 --> 18:35.282
Save a child's life.
It's good karma.

18:35.315 --> 18:38.418
I was thinking
more about cash.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.586
We could arrange
an award.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.854
(Clayton)
Not saying anything
until you do.

18:41.888 --> 18:46.393
Give him 1,000 bucks.
That do it?

18:46.426 --> 18:48.361
He has a great aunt Goldie.

18:48.395 --> 18:49.662
Used to make him
fruitcake at Christmas.

18:49.696 --> 18:50.863
Hard as a brick.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.299
Remember her last name?

18:52.332 --> 18:53.500
Prioleaux.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.402
On account I had
a girlfriend by that name.

18:55.435 --> 18:56.336
Of course, she was white.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.438
Yeah? You remember
where the aunt lived?

18:58.471 --> 19:01.841
Somewheres up in Harlem,
I think.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.845
(Goldie)
Shame on Alvin.

19:05.878 --> 19:08.448
Coming into town
and not coming to visit me.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.750
Well, how about
phone calls or letters?

19:10.783 --> 19:14.521
I haven't heard
from him in years.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.856
Do you have access
to the basement apartment?

19:16.889 --> 19:19.326
No, that's rented out
to a nice young couple.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.527
The Johnsons.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.229
Would you mind
if I take a look around?

19:22.262 --> 19:23.930
Be my guest.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.932
Does Alvin have any
other family in town?

19:25.965 --> 19:28.535
Lord, no.
Most of his family

19:28.568 --> 19:31.538
are diehard
New Orleanians.

19:31.571 --> 19:34.407
Even that hurricane
couldn't get them to budge.

19:34.441 --> 19:37.277
What did they call
that storm?

19:37.310 --> 19:38.411
Katrina.

19:38.445 --> 19:41.748
Is that it? Hmm.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.450
Nothing.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.218
Okay. Miss Goldie,
thank you so much.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.853
You call us if you can think
of anything, okay?

19:46.886 --> 19:52.492
I just did.
Camille. Not Katrina.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.228
Camille was the name
of that storm.

19:55.262 --> 19:56.896
Miss Goldie, what's
the president's name?

19:56.929 --> 20:00.967
Oh, Kennedy of course.
I voted for him.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.603
And when was the last time
you saw your nephew Alvin?

20:03.636 --> 20:06.873
Alvin? Hmm.
Let me think.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.941
Um...last week.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.777
You said it'd been years.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.579
No, he was here
just the other day.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.414
He brought those
beautiful girls to visit.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.249
The girls were here?

20:16.283 --> 20:18.485
They're moving in
downstairs.

20:18.518 --> 20:21.220
Alvin's busy fixing up
the basement.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.891
Nicki.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.533
She's burning up. We gotta
get her to a hospital.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.537
She has the same
symptoms as Dutch.

20:37.570 --> 20:42.609
Oh, God. Get a portable chest
and start IV Cipro.

20:42.642 --> 20:43.910
Alvin Dutch is dead.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.011
From what?

20:45.044 --> 20:47.246
Anthrax.

20:54.987 --> 20:55.955
How's Nicki?

20:55.988 --> 20:56.856
Her fever's gone down,

20:56.889 --> 20:58.024
and she's responding
to the antibiotics.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.459
She's gonna make
a full recovery.

20:59.492 --> 21:03.796
Good. I don't want to read
about Nicki or anthrax

21:03.830 --> 21:06.833
in The Ledger We can't
afford to panic the city.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.469
What's the plan?

21:09.502 --> 21:11.704
The hospital's called in
the CDC.

21:11.738 --> 21:14.006
They're setting up
emergency surveillance teams

21:14.040 --> 21:15.775
monitoring every ER
in the city

21:15.808 --> 21:18.077
for possible
anthrax exposures.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.712
They'll decide when
this goes public.

21:19.746 --> 21:20.980
Okay.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.984
My source said
Alvin Dutch died.

21:25.017 --> 21:25.985
What's going on, Olivia?

21:26.018 --> 21:27.019
It's not a good time.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.421
Alvin Dutch is dead.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.689
No one'll tell me
how he died.

21:29.722 --> 21:30.690
And the CDC just landed
a chopper on the roof.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.592
Jackson, I can't talk
about it.

21:32.625 --> 21:36.028
I'll find out.
You know I will.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.498
They examined Nicki.
Her hymen's intact.

21:38.531 --> 21:39.766
She wasn't raped.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.934
Alvin didn't have
a chance to get that far.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.770
Look, if Nicki's
gonna be okay,

21:43.803 --> 21:45.705
then why did
Alvin Dutch die?

21:45.738 --> 21:46.939
He had
inhalation anthrax.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.809
Even with aggressive
treatment it's 75% fatal.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.479
Nicki's case is cutaneous
through a cut on her palm.

21:52.512 --> 21:53.746
So he breathed in
the spores.

21:53.780 --> 21:54.781
Nicki only touched them.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.984
Exactly. We need to find out
how they got infected.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.452
Those flood waters
in New Orleans

21:59.486 --> 22:00.553
are full of toxins.

22:00.587 --> 22:01.754
No, it can't be that.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.823
Anthrax can only
be contracted

22:03.856 --> 22:06.058
by direct contact
with dry spores.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.126
And symptoms usually appear

22:07.159 --> 22:08.995
within seven days
of exposure.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.463
They've been here
for 10 weeks.

22:10.497 --> 22:15.034
And Lola and Tasha
are okay so far.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.136
Which Alvin and Nicki
must've contracted it

22:17.169 --> 22:18.838
within the last
48 hours.

22:20.640 --> 22:21.908
How did you cut
your hand, Nicki?

22:21.941 --> 22:23.109
On the glass.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.644
What glass?

22:24.677 --> 22:27.647
The tube that had
the fairy dust inside it.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.549
I tied a string around it.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.984
And made a necklace
for Bosha.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.120
Who's Bosha?

22:34.153 --> 22:36.723
My teddy. I left him
at the man's house.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.024
Can you get him
for me?

22:38.057 --> 22:39.058
We're gonna try, sweetie.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.129
How did the tube break?

22:43.162 --> 22:44.030
It fell on the floor

22:44.063 --> 22:47.033
when the man took
Bosha away from me.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.602
Then the fairy dust
spilled all over.

22:49.636 --> 22:51.604
Did you touch
the fairy dust?

22:51.638 --> 22:53.105
I tired to pick it up,

22:53.139 --> 22:56.008
but I cut my hand.

22:56.042 --> 22:59.779
Then the man got mad at me
and pushed me away.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.448
Then he cleaned it up.

23:01.481 --> 23:04.016
That's when
he inhaled it.

23:04.050 --> 23:07.019
Okay, Nicki. Where did
you get the fairy dust?

23:07.053 --> 23:09.756
I don't know.

23:09.789 --> 23:12.559
When did you make
the necklace?

23:12.592 --> 23:14.694
At the man's house.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.095
Did the man give you
the fairy dust?

23:16.128 --> 23:18.998
I don't remember.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.834
We can't
push her anymore.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.102
[door opens]

23:23.135 --> 23:24.904
(Tasha)
Nicki!

23:24.937 --> 23:27.507
Tasha and Lola don't
have any symptoms,

23:27.540 --> 23:29.041
but Doc Beresford gonna
check 'em out

23:29.075 --> 23:29.942
just to make sure
they're fine.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.044
That fairy dust
is still out there.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.580
More people
could be exposed.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.147
Well, if he threw it out,
it's on the street.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.183
Or in that basement.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.652
I'll tell the CDC
we're tracking down a lead.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.625
(Warner)
I found it.

23:45.658 --> 23:48.194
He swept up the anthrax, but
never emptied the dust pan.

23:48.227 --> 23:50.630
You find anything that could
identify the source?

23:50.663 --> 23:52.865
Based on toxicity
and granular size,

23:52.899 --> 23:54.534
it's military grade.

23:54.567 --> 23:55.635
So it came from a lab.
Had to.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.704
Anyway to find out where?

23:57.737 --> 24:01.474
Possibly. Researchers who work
with level three biohazards

24:01.508 --> 24:03.576
tag their samples
with chemical identifiers

24:03.610 --> 24:04.844
so they can be traced.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.613
How did Alvin Dutch
get a hold

24:06.646 --> 24:08.047
of weaponized anthrax?

24:08.080 --> 24:10.583
Only job that he had
was in a prison kitchen.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.485
I'll call as soon as I have
the test results.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.487
(Benson)
We'll be
at the precinct.

24:14.521 --> 24:17.857
Novak talked
to Louisiana Parole.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.626
Doesn't look
like Alvin Dutch

24:19.659 --> 24:21.027
has any connection
to any lab

24:21.060 --> 24:21.828
or research facility.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.262
Guess we gotta check
with the inmates

24:23.295 --> 24:25.031
who were in Angola
with him, huh?

24:28.234 --> 24:29.235
What the hell?

24:36.843 --> 24:38.811
Why is everyone
out of the squad?

24:38.845 --> 24:40.980
CDC ordered a full decon
of the building

24:41.013 --> 24:42.882
in case anthrax spores
were on Dutch's clothing.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.284
So much for keeping this
low profile.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.119
DCPI's spinning the story.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.589
Every news outlet
in town's here.

24:49.622 --> 24:50.957
You're screwing me.

24:50.990 --> 24:54.193
It's okay.

24:54.226 --> 24:55.995
Desk sergeant ate
some bad clams.

24:56.028 --> 24:56.929
Somebody overreacted.

24:56.963 --> 24:57.897
Thought it was an outbreak
of salmonella.

24:57.930 --> 25:00.232
I heard that from a public
information officer.

25:00.266 --> 25:02.034
Are you gonna tell me
the same thing?

25:02.068 --> 25:03.836
We just work here.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.304
I'm not your enemy.
Whatever's going on,

25:05.337 --> 25:07.206
the public has
a right to know.

25:07.239 --> 25:08.641
Mr. Zane, I'm gonna
have to ask you

25:08.675 --> 25:10.242
to step behind
the perimeter.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.247
I guess those bad clams
are contagious.

25:18.184 --> 25:21.087
If civilians are in danger,
it's our duty to warn them.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.722
And after 9/11,
every secretary in town

25:22.755 --> 25:24.190
opened mail wearing
rubber gloves.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.925
We don't want to start
that kind of hysteria.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.094
But he's got a point.

25:28.127 --> 25:31.163
Building's clear.
You can go back in now.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.265
I want everybody on
Alvin Dutch's movements

25:33.299 --> 25:35.067
since he got to New York.

25:35.101 --> 25:36.068
Find out everywhere
he's been

25:36.102 --> 25:38.805
and how the hell he found
a vial of anthrax.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.110
What the hell?

25:44.143 --> 25:47.246
(Benson)
Everything's gone.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.816
The whole decon
routine was a scam.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.584
Why, Santa, why?

25:51.618 --> 25:53.219
My DD Fives,
notebooks, all gone.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.855
Who do we call
when we've been raped?

25:55.888 --> 25:57.590
(Cragen)
I'll start with One P.P.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.158
Police Commissioner's
gonna hit the roof.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.827
They got you too?

26:00.860 --> 26:03.262
Alvin Dutch's body,
the vial, all gone.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.264
Dr. Beresford,
do you have the girls?

26:08.668 --> 26:12.104
Okay. Thanks for trying.

26:12.138 --> 26:14.273
The feds took Tasha,
Nicki, and Lola.

26:14.306 --> 26:16.242
Wouldn't tell
the hospital where.

26:16.275 --> 26:17.877
The government
can do this?

26:17.910 --> 26:19.912
Since the Patriot Act,
they can do anything.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.914
P.C. gonna tear
the feds a new one?

26:21.948 --> 26:23.816
He tore me one.
An order to forthwith

26:23.850 --> 26:26.585
down to Federal Plaza.
You too.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.696
(man)
Captain Cragen,
M.E. Warner,

26:36.729 --> 26:38.798
your part in this
investigation is over.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.933
There's no need for your squad
take any further action

26:40.967 --> 26:42.935
regarding Alvin Dutch
or his death.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.403
What about the girls?

26:44.436 --> 26:46.238
They're being
well cared for.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.373
And all appropriate steps
are being taken

26:47.406 --> 26:48.708
to locate next-of-kin.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.242
Those girls have
been through hell.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.211
They need therapy
and continuity

26:52.244 --> 26:54.313
with people that
they know and trust.

26:54.346 --> 26:56.282
I appreciate your compassion,
Detective Benson.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.350
But this is a matter
of national security.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.919
(Cragen)
You said it was a matter
of public health

26:59.952 --> 27:01.053
when you raided
our squad room.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.288
I think you owe us
an explanation.

27:02.321 --> 27:03.155
I can't give you one.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.757
You don't have
the security clearance.

27:04.791 --> 27:05.858
[Blackberry rings]

27:05.892 --> 27:07.326
All information obtained
by the NYPD

27:07.359 --> 27:10.162
or the Medical Examiner's
Office is now classified.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.297
We just keep
our mouths shut

27:11.330 --> 27:13.199
till people start
dying from anthrax.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.701
The federal government is
prepared to deal with

27:14.734 --> 27:16.335
any and all exigencies.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.671
Sure. By calling in
the black helicopters.

27:18.705 --> 27:20.840
For once, he's not
being paranoid.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.208
(federal officer)
This is meeting is over.

27:22.241 --> 27:26.212
Any leak of classified
material will be investigated

27:26.245 --> 27:30.817
and punished
as a federal offense.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.418
You may go.

27:38.791 --> 27:40.693
We just gonna
bend over and take it?

27:40.727 --> 27:42.995
We have no choice.
This came from Washington.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.997
The P.C. can't
overrule the feds.

27:45.031 --> 27:47.333
Well, what about the girls?
We just forget about them

27:47.366 --> 27:48.467
and everything
that they've been through?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.837
Yes.

27:50.870 --> 27:54.173
This is crap.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.908
(Warner)
We could have a citywide
health crisis.

27:55.942 --> 27:58.077
If the public isn't warned,
they can't protect themselves.

27:58.110 --> 28:01.380
Melinda, my hands are tied.

28:06.853 --> 28:09.421
Olivia.

28:09.455 --> 28:12.358
I need to talk to you
and Elliot. Alone.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.428
Before the feds
cleaned me out,

28:16.462 --> 28:19.331
I e-mailed the results of
my analysis of the anthrax

28:19.365 --> 28:20.833
to a friend at the NIH.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.835
Got the results during
our ass chewing.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.403
Yeah? Your friend
ID a source?

28:24.436 --> 28:27.139
Louisiana
BioChem Defense.

28:27.173 --> 28:29.976
It's a research facility
outside New Orleans.

28:30.009 --> 28:33.345
They have CDC authority
to work with select agents,

28:33.379 --> 28:37.083
including ricin, ebola,
smallpox, and anthrax.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.084
What were they doing?

28:38.117 --> 28:39.385
Bioweapons engineering.

28:39.418 --> 28:40.452
Germ warfare.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.421
Yes. And developing
vaccines

28:42.454 --> 28:44.924
against bioterror
weapons.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.159
And they're not
the only facility.

28:47.193 --> 28:50.129
There were five level three
bioweapons labs

28:50.162 --> 28:51.163
in the flood zone.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.332
What happened
when Katrina hit?

28:53.365 --> 28:54.466
They lost
all their work

28:54.500 --> 28:56.102
and more than
5,000 lab animals.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.337
Many of them infected
with lethal viruses.

28:58.370 --> 29:02.374
One university was licensed
to research anthrax

29:02.408 --> 29:05.144
and a genetically
engineered mousepox.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.379
I don't remember seeing
this on the news.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.448
They didn't want you to.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.383
The government claimed that
every hot lab was secured

29:11.417 --> 29:13.452
before the storm.
Animals euthanized.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.955
Samples destroyed.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.223
I'm a scientist.
I'm not throwing away

29:17.256 --> 29:18.991
years of my research.
Someone took that anthrax

29:19.025 --> 29:22.194
from Louisiana BioChem Defense
and then brought it here.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.330
And along the way crossed
paths with Alvin Dutch.

29:24.363 --> 29:25.331
Whoever it is,

29:25.364 --> 29:26.432
they're
out there somewhere.

29:26.465 --> 29:27.533
And God knows what else
they've got.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.501
And we can't do
a damn thing

29:29.535 --> 29:32.271
as long as the boys from DC
have a gag in our mouths.

29:50.356 --> 29:51.390
Change of heart?

29:51.423 --> 29:56.528
Yeah.

29:56.562 --> 29:58.797
I want to tell you
a story.

30:16.282 --> 30:18.517
What the hell
were you thinking?

30:21.520 --> 30:22.922
Nice picture.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.056
Why'd you give it
to him?

30:24.090 --> 30:26.225
Who says I did?

30:26.258 --> 30:28.594
Don't play games with me.
Olivia, look.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.096
The Chief of D's is
in there right now.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.597
The feds are going nuts.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.532
They know someone
from this squad

30:33.565 --> 30:35.167
leaked that photo
to The Ledger.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.103
A lot of people had cameras
in the park that day.

30:37.136 --> 30:41.207
Jackson Zane could've gotten
that photo from anybody.

30:41.240 --> 30:45.011
Oh. Okay.

30:45.044 --> 30:45.912
You really think
that's gonna fly?

30:45.945 --> 30:48.114
Those girls lost
their mother, their home.

30:48.147 --> 30:51.117
Everything.
But they still trusted us

30:51.150 --> 30:53.052
to make things right.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.353
I don't ever want
to read about

30:54.386 --> 30:57.023
a classified investigation
in the tabloids again.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.091
You receive an order
to comply with the feds,

30:59.125 --> 31:02.261
you and everyone under
your command obey it.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.663
Or you won't have
a command anymore.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.265
Yes, Chief.

31:10.236 --> 31:13.139
(Cragen)
Olivia.

31:13.172 --> 31:15.641
In here now.

31:34.093 --> 31:35.361
I don't like being
bossed around

31:35.394 --> 31:38.364
by some G-man
in a $1,000 suit.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.632
But when I am told
to stand down

31:40.666 --> 31:42.201
in the interests
of national security,

31:42.234 --> 31:43.469
I bite my tongue.
Captain--

31:43.502 --> 31:46.205
Shut up.
When they question me,

31:46.238 --> 31:48.975
I don't want to lie.
And they will question us all.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.348
If they prove
you leaked this,

31:56.382 --> 31:57.549
they will take your job,

31:57.583 --> 32:02.221
your pension,
and your freedom.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.925
I don't want to visit you
in a federal lock-up, Olivia.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.232
Dismissed.

32:24.676 --> 32:27.279
How bad?

32:27.313 --> 32:29.148
Well, look.
Maybe it was worth it.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.150
How?

32:31.183 --> 32:33.052
ACS just called.

32:33.085 --> 32:35.254
I think all this media
attention spooked the feds.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.156
They returned the girls.

32:37.189 --> 32:40.759
We gotta go talk to them.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.029
You have lost your mind.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.663
Those girls are safe
for now.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.598
But what about
the rest of the city?

32:46.632 --> 32:48.500
There's anthrax
out there somewhere,

32:48.534 --> 32:50.369
and Nicki is the key
to finding it.

32:50.402 --> 32:53.205
You don't think the feds
questioned her all night long?

32:53.239 --> 32:54.606
Elliot, she's a traumatized
eight-year-old girl

32:54.640 --> 32:56.375
who's been kidnapped
and molested

32:56.408 --> 32:58.410
after watching
her mother die.

32:58.444 --> 33:01.380
We know how
to talk to her.

33:07.786 --> 33:09.621
(Benson)
I brought you something
to make you feel better.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.492
You found Bosha.

33:13.525 --> 33:17.096
Well, Bosha got all dirty.
But this is his little brother.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.498
You think he'd like
a necklace too?

33:19.531 --> 33:23.102
Yes, but I don't have
anymore fairy dust.

33:23.135 --> 33:26.338
Well, we could go back
and get some.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.340
I don't know
where the van is.

33:31.743 --> 33:33.112
What van?

33:33.145 --> 33:36.615
The van that gave us
a ride to New York.

33:36.648 --> 33:40.286
The fairy dust was
in the van.

33:42.754 --> 33:46.125
Honey...

33:46.158 --> 33:49.428
Nicki, it's okay. You're not
gonna get in trouble.

33:49.461 --> 33:51.463
Yes, I will.

33:51.497 --> 33:55.134
Mama says it's a sin
to take things

33:55.167 --> 33:56.702
that don't belong
to you.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.304
Well, you know what, Nicki?

33:58.337 --> 34:00.472
I want to call the guy
who drove that van.

34:00.506 --> 34:01.707
And I'm gonna tell him

34:01.740 --> 34:04.110
that you just borrowed
the fairy dust.

34:04.143 --> 34:07.213
It's not such a bad thing
to borrow stuff, right?

34:09.681 --> 34:12.284
There was lots of
fairy dust in the van.

34:12.318 --> 34:16.255
Can you ask him
if I can have some more?

34:16.288 --> 34:17.823
For little Bosha?

34:17.856 --> 34:20.559
We will, but we gonna
find out who he is first.

34:20.592 --> 34:23.462
Do you remember his name?

34:23.495 --> 34:26.198
Mr. Michael.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.733
Don't worry. I made all
the calls from a payphone.

34:27.766 --> 34:28.700
What'd you find out?

34:28.734 --> 34:31.170
Louisiana BioChem Defense
has seven employees

34:31.203 --> 34:33.105
with Michael as their
first or last name.

34:33.139 --> 34:34.873
You check their whereabouts
during Katrina?

34:34.906 --> 34:36.475
All evacuated
before the storm

34:36.508 --> 34:39.145
except one lab technician.
Michael Delpit.

34:39.178 --> 34:40.879
He volunteered to stay
behind and guard the lab.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.514
Or loot it.

34:42.548 --> 34:44.250
Where's Delpit now?

34:44.283 --> 34:45.817
He quit. Tracked him
down in Jersey

34:45.851 --> 34:48.154
working at a lab
in New Brunswick.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.888
Munch found my auntie.

34:49.921 --> 34:51.457
Mrs. Fontenot found us.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.592
I saw the girls picture
in the paper.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.162
Thank you so much for taking
such good care of them.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.730
She says we can go live
with her. Um, where's Nicki?

34:58.764 --> 35:01.099
She's right in there.
Why don't you go in and see her?

35:04.403 --> 35:05.471
Where you going?

35:05.504 --> 35:07.105
Don't ask, don't tell.

35:10.842 --> 35:13.245
(Stabler)
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man?

35:13.279 --> 35:15.881
Back there.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.217
Michael Delpit.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.552
This is
a restricted area.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.854
Not as restricted as a life
sentence in Leavenworth.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.022
You're under arrest
for the theft

35:24.055 --> 35:26.725
and interstate transportation
of a level three biohazard.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.527
Where's the anthrax?

35:28.560 --> 35:30.296
It's gone.

35:30.329 --> 35:31.630
Guy first got in touch
with me

35:31.663 --> 35:34.900
when I was working for
Louisiana BioDefense.

35:34.933 --> 35:37.569
Offered me big bucks
for weapons grade anthrax.

35:37.603 --> 35:40.472
But I couldn't smuggle it
out of the lab.

35:40.506 --> 35:41.640
Right. But you saw
an opportunity

35:41.673 --> 35:43.309
when Katrina hit.

35:43.342 --> 35:44.876
Well, the staff split.
Just me and the monkeys

35:44.910 --> 35:47.646
and the lab rats stayed
to ride out the storm.

35:47.679 --> 35:52.451
When the power went out,
so did the security system.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.520
I loaded up the van
and hit the road.

35:54.553 --> 35:55.921
(Benson)
But you stopped

35:55.954 --> 35:59.191
and picked up Alvin Dutch
and the girls. Why?

35:59.225 --> 36:01.827
I figured a family of evacuees
would give me a good cover

36:01.860 --> 36:02.961
if I hit a roadblock.

36:02.994 --> 36:03.895
(Stabler)
Where'd you drop off
the anthrax?

36:03.929 --> 36:06.798
14th Street. Met the guy
in a parking lot.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.835
He gave me the cash.

36:09.868 --> 36:10.769
I didn't ask any questions.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.571
[Benson on tape]
Did you see him leave?

36:12.604 --> 36:13.605
[Michael on tape]
He walked around the corner.

36:13.639 --> 36:14.806
Pause it.
[Michael on tape]
Disappeared.

36:14.840 --> 36:15.674
[clicks cassette player off]

36:15.707 --> 36:17.743
Did he ever tell you
who he sold it to?

36:17.776 --> 36:19.778
He never knew
the guy's name.

36:19.811 --> 36:20.779
All he had was
a cell phone number.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.381
Give it to me.

36:22.414 --> 36:24.650
It was prepaid.
Already out of service.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.585
Damn it.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.387
Hold on.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.788
So you stole
the anthrax.

36:29.821 --> 36:32.358
You sold it
to some guy.

36:32.391 --> 36:34.426
You bother to ask him
what he was gonna do with it?

36:34.460 --> 36:36.428
Not my concern.
I got my money.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.497
He got what he wanted.

36:38.530 --> 36:42.768
And all
the innocent people

36:42.801 --> 36:44.536
who could die?

36:44.570 --> 36:49.675
It won't be me.
I've got a supply of Cipro.

36:49.708 --> 36:53.312
He brokers death and doesn't
lose a night's sleep.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.780
I always wondered
how they could do that.

36:54.813 --> 36:57.349
Guys like Delpit
don't think about

36:57.383 --> 36:59.618
who they're hurting.
It's like a rapist.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.487
Doesn't think
about his victim.

37:04.623 --> 37:05.991
About that tape.

37:06.024 --> 37:08.960
Only my partner and I
know that it exists.

37:08.994 --> 37:12.598
Delpit didn't know that
we were recording him.

37:12.631 --> 37:13.599
You guys don't
tape interrogations.

37:13.632 --> 37:14.933
Why'd you do it?

37:14.966 --> 37:18.937
The feds are gonna make
Michael Delpit disappear.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.239
I don't want the truth
to vanish with him.

37:24.943 --> 37:28.980
You can't ever let anyone
know that you heard this.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.682
Not your editor.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.884
You have my word.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.957
Is that the end
of the tape?

37:38.990 --> 37:42.461
Almost.

37:43.729 --> 37:44.830
(Delpit)
If people are too stupid

37:44.863 --> 37:46.632
to plan for all
eventualities,

37:46.665 --> 37:47.866
then they're too dumb
to live.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.701
I think of it
as natural selection.

37:49.735 --> 37:52.704
All those deaths will be
on your hands.

37:52.738 --> 37:55.841
[chuckles]
Don't be so dramatic.
I'm just the middleman.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.709
It's a business
transaction.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.880
Military contractors make
fortunes building weapons

38:01.913 --> 38:04.583
that bomb countries back
to the Stone Age.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.652
Then they double their money
getting government contracts

38:06.685 --> 38:09.321
to rebuild war zones.

38:09.355 --> 38:13.325
Why shouldn't I get
a piece of the pie?

38:13.359 --> 38:14.660
He's a cold bastard.

38:17.829 --> 38:20.065
We've got company.

38:26.104 --> 38:27.105
I've gotta get
out of here.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.675
Fire stairs behind me.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.377
Okay. Give me the tape.

38:31.410 --> 38:32.811
One second.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.882
Look, if the feds
find me here,

38:36.915 --> 38:37.949
you and I are both
going to jail.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.385
And your story's
never gonna get out.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.852
I'm almost done.

38:50.128 --> 38:51.530
Now, Jackson.

39:36.475 --> 39:40.746
Olivia? They're keeping it
all very hush-hush.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.180
But my buddy in the U.S.
Attorney's office

39:42.213 --> 39:43.515
got word from a Marshall.

39:43.549 --> 39:45.984
Jackson Zane's refused
to name his source.

39:48.887 --> 39:49.921
He's going to jail.

39:49.955 --> 39:52.691
Yes. There's no federal
shield law for journalists.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.761
So refusing to talk
is contempt of court.

39:55.794 --> 39:58.664
I read his article.

39:58.697 --> 40:01.567
Anthrax scares
the hell out of me.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.801
It takes a lot of balls

40:02.834 --> 40:05.136
to go to jail
for the truth.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.505
How long can they
hold him?

40:06.538 --> 40:09.074
Until he names names.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.786
Thank you.

40:42.741 --> 40:43.742
You shouldn't have come.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.176
They'll be checking
my visitors.

40:45.210 --> 40:47.112
I used my undercover alias.
Rachel Martin.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.847
It's still risky.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.182
I had to see you.

40:53.919 --> 40:55.487
I want you to talk.

40:55.521 --> 40:57.022
I want you to tell them
it was me.

40:57.055 --> 40:58.790
No, that anthrax
is still out there.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.191
We both did
the right thing.

41:00.225 --> 41:01.593
But I'm not in jail.

41:01.627 --> 41:03.194
You don't belong here.

41:03.228 --> 41:05.096
You were protecting
those girls.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.032
Hell, the whole city.

41:07.065 --> 41:09.267
You did your job.
And I'm doing mine.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.837
You're sitting
in jail, Jackson.

41:11.870 --> 41:14.840
Give them my name
and get back to work.

41:14.873 --> 41:17.909
I give them your name,
they win.

41:17.943 --> 41:20.579
There's no freedom
without free press.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.816
Now I chose
to write this story.

41:24.850 --> 41:27.118
And I'll take
the consequences.

41:27.152 --> 41:29.721
Good-bye, Olivia.

41:29.755 --> 41:31.156
Don't come back.

41:40.799 --> 41:40.866
