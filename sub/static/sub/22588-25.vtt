00:20.682 --> 00:26.185
This is just too spotty.
What an elegant coat.

00:26.187 --> 00:29.087
And a magnificent color.

00:29.089 --> 00:30.455
Darling, what do you think?

00:30.457 --> 00:32.557
If you like it,
darling, it's all yours.

00:32.558 --> 00:35.026
Oh, you're a dream.
I just love it.

00:35.028 --> 00:39.096
Alright, everybody, stand still
and no one will be injured!

00:39.098 --> 00:40.964
This is a stickup!

00:40.966 --> 00:42.632
Get out of here.

00:42.634 --> 00:43.532
Who are you anyhow?

00:43.534 --> 00:46.535
Your friendly

00:46.537 --> 00:48.537
at your service, sir.

00:48.539 --> 00:49.905
What is this?
A vulgar joke?

00:49.907 --> 00:52.641
Ah, yes. But the joke
is on you, my good fellow.

00:52.643 --> 00:57.679
And there's nothing vulgar
about half a million in furs.

00:58.848 --> 01:01.481
I do believe it's that
arch criminal The Joker.

01:01.483 --> 01:06.486
Ladies and gentlemen,
my staff of felonious furriers.

01:07.922 --> 01:10.889
Alright, everybody,
to the center of the room.

01:10.891 --> 01:12.056
Come, come, come.

01:12.058 --> 01:18.128
A joke. What are more mink skins
used for than anything else?

01:18.130 --> 01:20.463
To hold minks together.

01:20.998 --> 01:24.232
Mr. and Mrs. Prescott Belmont

01:24.234 --> 01:26.901
of the banking
Belmonts I believe.

01:26.903 --> 01:30.604
Oh, what lovely jewels,
Mrs. Belmont.

01:30.606 --> 01:31.538
And what a stunning coat.

01:31.540 --> 01:33.706
Well, thank heavens
we haven't bought it yet.

01:33.708 --> 01:37.543
Uh, closer. Closer, everyone.
Closer, closer.

01:37.545 --> 01:39.745
I want a tight
little group.

01:39.747 --> 01:41.680
Alright, staff, get ready.

01:41.682 --> 01:42.747
- Take aim!
- No.

01:42.749 --> 01:45.049
They're gonna shoot
us down like cattle.

02:12.537 --> 02:15.739
Oh, thank you, dear lady.

02:15.741 --> 02:17.173
I'm all stuck up.

02:17.175 --> 02:21.710
But of course, I said
this is a stickup. Ha ha ha.

02:21.712 --> 02:24.179
And now to all, farewell.

02:24.181 --> 02:26.848
Staff, let us away.

02:31.686 --> 02:32.819
A hairpin?

02:32.821 --> 02:34.253
First we get a report that he's

02:34.255 --> 02:36.755
stolen a hole
from a golf green.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.691
And now a hairpin?

02:41.093 --> 02:42.927
What is The Joker up to?

02:42.929 --> 02:45.195
About to start on
another series of his

02:45.197 --> 02:47.897
dastardly crimes,
I'll wager.

02:47.899 --> 02:49.899
- Then we'd better not delay.
- Right.

02:49.901 --> 02:52.034
For there's no one
else who can cope

02:52.036 --> 02:54.536
with the capers of
that devilish clown.

02:54.538 --> 02:55.203
Right, Chief O'Hara.

02:55.205 --> 02:58.005
Though we may never know
who he is behind his mask

02:58.007 --> 03:01.842
thank goodness he's there
when a crisis befalls us.

03:03.645 --> 03:08.214
<i> And in Wayne Manor, stately</i>
<i> home of millionaire Bruce Wayne</i>

03:08.216 --> 03:11.951
<i> and his youthful</i>
<i> ward Dick Grayson.</i>

03:23.229 --> 03:26.197
I'll solicit his presence, sir.

03:34.940 --> 03:38.976
But it's so much harder with
the pieces upside down, Bruce.

03:38.978 --> 03:39.609
Of course.

03:39.611 --> 03:41.310
But think of what
excellent training

03:41.312 --> 03:43.078
it is for your
visual memory.

03:43.080 --> 03:45.180
Gosh, yes,
I guess that's true.

03:45.182 --> 03:46.848
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

03:46.850 --> 03:48.015
It's the Bat-phone.

03:48.017 --> 03:50.250
Oh, boy, let's go!

03:54.321 --> 03:58.023
Well, where are
they off to now?

03:58.025 --> 03:58.656
Eh?

03:58.658 --> 04:00.891
I just brought
them a little snack.

04:00.893 --> 04:01.892
A call I believe, madam

04:01.894 --> 04:04.160
from Mr. Wayne's
sporting goods supply.

04:04.162 --> 04:09.832
A superior new design of, uh,
binoculars has just arrived.

04:09.834 --> 04:11.967
For their bird-watching.

04:13.636 --> 04:15.803
- Yes, commissioner.
- 'Dire news, Batman.'

04:15.805 --> 04:19.807
- 'It's The Joker again.'
- We'll be right there.

04:19.809 --> 04:21.942

06:13.607 --> 06:17.276

Robin.

stand back, please.

07:16.196 --> 07:21.033

- Saints alive.

07:21.035 --> 07:23.568
Strange, but..

07:25.237 --> 07:26.237
...harmless.

07:32.310 --> 07:35.378
A small recording machine
with a tape on it.

07:35.380 --> 07:36.545
'Play it, Batman.'

07:36.547 --> 07:38.980
'Good evening, commissioner.'

07:38.982 --> 07:41.115
'I assume Batman

07:41.117 --> 07:44.184
'so give him my regards,
will you? Ha ha ha.'

07:44.186 --> 07:47.187
'Oh, by the way, did you
hear what the maid said'

07:47.189 --> 07:50.623
'when the duchess asked
if she'd given the goldfish'

07:50.625 --> 07:52.391
'fresh water that morning?'

07:52.393 --> 07:57.596
'No, Your Highness. He hasn't
yet used what he had yesterday.'

08:02.000 --> 08:03.667
Not a very funny
joke I'd say.

08:03.669 --> 08:05.702
The Joker's never
are...in the end.

08:05.704 --> 08:08.404
Do you suppose any of
this could mean anything?

08:08.406 --> 08:10.672
Possibly. But not
what it seems to mean.

08:10.674 --> 08:13.508
That's the key to
The Joker's twisted mind.

08:13.510 --> 08:17.512
But why? It-it's not like
The Joker to help us catch him.

08:17.514 --> 08:18.779
It could be a trap.

08:18.781 --> 08:20.413
Why would he want a hole

08:20.415 --> 08:22.681
from a golf course?

08:22.683 --> 08:25.784
The golf course!
Of course!

08:28.420 --> 08:30.387
"His Highness,
the <i> Maharajah</i> of Nimpah

08:30.389 --> 08:32.688
"arrived in Gotham City
today and he's so rich

08:32.691 --> 08:36.693
he plays golf with jewel
inlaid solid gold clubs."

08:36.695 --> 08:40.129
That's it, Batman!
The Joke on the tape!

08:40.131 --> 08:42.464
His Highness
and the golden goldfish.

08:42.466 --> 08:45.266
And he's scheduled
to play in one hour

08:45.268 --> 08:47.201
at the Winnie Coto
Country Club.

08:47.203 --> 08:49.770
- Where he stole the hole.
- Let's go.

08:49.772 --> 08:52.773
Be careful, Batman. Be careful.

09:10.656 --> 09:14.458
<i> While at the exclusive</i>
<i> Winnie Coto Country Club</i>

09:14.460 --> 09:19.963
<i> a sinister figure</i>
<i> looms above the fairway.</i>

09:45.155 --> 09:46.088
It's Batman.

09:46.090 --> 09:49.558
Crime is certainly
rampant these days.

09:51.628 --> 09:52.494
Batman!

09:53.096 --> 09:54.662
- Batman I presume.
- Correct.

09:54.864 --> 09:56.797
I'm Prescott Belmont,
president of the club here.

09:56.799 --> 09:59.900
Got your message. I'll be
glad to assist you in any way.

09:59.902 --> 10:02.535
Good. There could be
more foul play here today.

10:02.537 --> 10:05.471
Has the <i> Maharajah</i> of Nimpah
begun his round?

10:05.473 --> 10:08.273
Not five minutes ago
with His Honor the Mayor.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.340
They're still
on the first hole.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.909
Is there some vantage point
overlooking the course?

10:11.911 --> 10:14.078
Any place where we
won't be conspicuous.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.412
The lower terrace.

10:15.414 --> 10:17.380
Let's go.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.694
'Odd.'

10:32.696 --> 10:35.163
Everything looks serene.

10:35.165 --> 10:37.698
Let me look.

10:40.301 --> 10:41.668
Holy <i> Taj Mahal!</i>

10:41.670 --> 10:45.138
Look at those
jewel-studded golf clubs!

10:46.373 --> 10:48.140
Yes.

10:49.041 --> 10:54.645
That would be a rich
prize for The Joker.

11:11.795 --> 11:13.295
Very fine chip shot,
Your Highness.

11:13.297 --> 11:16.831
What's so fine?
It should've been closer.

11:16.833 --> 11:19.733
Yes, but the grass grows
the wrong way, Your Highness.

11:19.735 --> 11:23.937
Ah, if this were only
Nimpahnese blue grass.

11:24.738 --> 11:25.904
Out of my way,
Your Highness.

11:25.906 --> 11:30.275
Mr. Mayor, please don't
putt while I'm talking.

11:30.909 --> 11:33.377
Well, forgive me, Your Highness.

11:33.379 --> 11:35.879
Alright, go ahead.

12:20.486 --> 12:23.253
Batman! Something is happening!

12:23.255 --> 12:25.355
Looks like yellow gas.

12:30.961 --> 12:32.194
It is gas.

12:32.196 --> 12:34.162
Quick, to the Batmobile.

12:34.164 --> 12:38.166
Sorry to be so abrupt.
This could be an emergency.

13:16.770 --> 13:17.536
Wait!

13:24.376 --> 13:27.544
It's not just the clubs,
they're stealing the <i> maharajah.</i>

13:27.546 --> 13:28.811
Good heavens!

13:33.416 --> 13:34.749
With a forklift.

13:34.851 --> 13:37.217
Let's get going and make
an emergency Bat-turn.

13:37.219 --> 13:39.652
Not this time, old chum.
Gotta think of the golfers.

13:39.654 --> 13:44.323
The retro-rockets would burn up
the course for a hundred yards.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.618
Holy tee shot!
It's gone!

14:14.620 --> 14:16.519
But where?

14:36.236 --> 14:37.102
Holy shrinkage!

14:37.104 --> 14:39.704
A trick of some sort,
no doubt.

14:39.706 --> 14:42.339
There's something inside.

14:42.341 --> 14:44.541
We'll see.

14:51.649 --> 14:52.649
It's a note.

14:53.151 --> 14:55.017
"Batman, did you
hear about the kid

14:55.019 --> 14:57.119
"who wanted to sell
his dog for $50,000?

14:57.121 --> 15:00.755
"He got his price.
Traded it for two $25,000 cats.

15:00.757 --> 15:04.125
"But you can't make a deal
like that for the <i> maharajah</i>

15:04.127 --> 15:07.094
"because we've got
plenty of cats already.

15:07.096 --> 15:08.862
Don't call us,
we'll call you."

15:08.864 --> 15:12.599
- "Plenty of cats?"
- Cats, cats and more cats!

15:12.601 --> 15:15.468
It could be an old refinery
Katz, Katz, Katz & Company.

15:15.470 --> 15:18.872
It's been outta use for years,
but it'd make a perfect hideout!

15:18.874 --> 15:19.939
It sounds too simple.

15:19.941 --> 15:21.507
Almost as if he wanted us

15:21.509 --> 15:22.874
to solve it immediately.

15:22.976 --> 15:26.711
- Gotta be on our guard, Batman.
- Right. Let's go!

15:50.135 --> 15:53.237
<i> How right they are, for inside</i>
<i> the seemingly innocent</i>

15:53.239 --> 15:59.109
<i> old refinery The Joker and his</i>
<i> crew prepare for company.</i>

16:00.979 --> 16:03.579
Oh, my playful, pilfering pals

16:03.581 --> 16:05.713
this is going to be delicious.

16:05.815 --> 16:07.781
Bring the table in
here quickly. Quickly.

16:07.783 --> 16:11.084
Put it right in the center. Now
get the chairs. Get the chairs.

16:11.086 --> 16:15.221
One, one here, one over here,
one there, one there, one there.

16:15.223 --> 16:18.157
Quickly. Everything
must be just right.

16:18.159 --> 16:20.159
Now, how does that
look, my pretty?

16:20.161 --> 16:22.060
- Oh, perfect, Joker.
- Ha ha ha.

16:22.262 --> 16:23.461
Do you really
think he'll come?

16:23.563 --> 16:26.898
Ah, he'll be here, never fear.
You mark my words.

16:26.900 --> 16:28.332
Joker, why didn't you get me

16:28.334 --> 16:31.034
something longer than this
when you had the chance?

16:31.036 --> 16:33.102
Oh, that's not
my style, lovey.

16:33.104 --> 16:35.704
Any common
hoodlum can do that.

16:35.706 --> 16:37.505
Oh ho, but never fear, my dear.

16:37.507 --> 16:41.075
We'll buy you countless
furs...and jewels.

16:41.077 --> 16:43.510
Oh, gee, Joker,
you're perfect.

16:43.512 --> 16:46.112
- Yeah, practically.
- 'Joker! Joker!'

16:46.114 --> 16:48.414
He just parked
his car up the street!

16:48.416 --> 16:50.048
Excellent! Everybody,
take your places.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.684
And you stand out
of harm's way, my dear.

16:52.686 --> 16:55.419
There. Deal them out.

17:02.059 --> 17:04.693
What will we do, Batman?
Use the Bat-ropes?

17:04.694 --> 17:06.728
Go in through
the skylight?

17:06.730 --> 17:07.829
Let's try
the direct approach.

17:07.830 --> 17:11.866
With his twisted mind,
it could surprise him.

17:16.037 --> 17:18.972
Strange. It's not locked.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.694
Holy spiderwebs.

17:44.696 --> 17:47.329
A nest for rats.

18:43.750 --> 18:46.685
- Now.
- We got you this time, Joker!

18:50.889 --> 18:54.357
Want to join the game,
Batman and Boy Wonder?

18:54.359 --> 18:57.059
You'd better hurry.
It won't last long.

19:00.763 --> 19:02.497
Holy looking glass!

19:02.499 --> 19:06.534
A truck with folding
mirrors on its sides.

19:06.536 --> 19:07.501
No wonder it vanished.

19:07.503 --> 19:10.437
Yes, with nothing
but the green of the golf course

19:10.439 --> 19:16.009
to reflect, it turned green too
and seemed to disappear.

19:16.011 --> 19:18.811
But we're on to
your tricks, Joker.

19:18.813 --> 19:20.045

19:44.431 --> 19:45.663
Holy..

19:45.665 --> 19:48.465
It's like being caught
in a barrel of snakes!

19:48.467 --> 19:54.838
Well, well, now I must say,
this is an expected pleasure.

19:55.574 --> 19:58.775
You may have won
the first round, Joker

19:58.777 --> 20:01.544
but we don't give up.

20:05.683 --> 20:07.182
Hmm, I've heard about Batman

20:07.184 --> 20:10.351
but this is the first
time I've ever met him.

20:10.353 --> 20:11.919
And the last.

20:11.921 --> 20:14.254
So that's
your dirty game.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.221
We might have known.

20:15.223 --> 20:16.822
Why didn't we
think about this?

20:16.824 --> 20:17.923
- Think about it?
- Yeah.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.659
What's this? Have you
gone soft, my little savage?

20:20.661 --> 20:22.260
Well, I, uh,
I-I bet he wouldn't

20:22.262 --> 20:24.762
try to knock you off
if he had the chance.

20:24.764 --> 20:27.397
Oh, no, he'd merely
try to incarcerate me

20:27.399 --> 20:30.299
in durance vile
for the rest of my life.

20:30.301 --> 20:35.704
A fate much worse than death
for a spirit such as mine.

20:35.838 --> 20:40.174
Still...we might give
them a sporting chance.

20:40.176 --> 20:41.108
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, boss.

20:41.110 --> 20:43.009
We won't get another
chance like this.

20:43.011 --> 20:45.211
That's right.
We've gotta get rid of him.

20:45.213 --> 20:46.378
We owe it to
the criminal world.

20:46.380 --> 20:50.382
Well, we'll see. Bring them
along. Come, come, come.

20:51.952 --> 20:53.818
And now, my Dynamic Duo

20:53.820 --> 20:58.689
something I've been waiting
to do for a long time.

21:06.497 --> 21:08.865
There, my funny ray
has neutralized

21:08.867 --> 21:12.935
the gadgets in your utility
belts for at least an hour.

21:15.003 --> 21:17.504
You're both good
swimmers I hope.

21:17.506 --> 21:18.204
Fair.

21:18.206 --> 21:19.371
Then you can easily remain

21:19.373 --> 21:21.106
afloat for an hour I presume?

21:21.108 --> 21:23.341
If we weren't weighted
down or something.

21:23.343 --> 21:24.508
Boss, you let these guys escape

21:24.510 --> 21:26.510
it'll be the mistake
of your career.

21:26.512 --> 21:27.944
- 'Yeah.'
- 'You keep outta this.'

21:27.946 --> 21:30.313
If he wants to
give them a chance

21:30.315 --> 21:31.180
that's his business.

21:31.182 --> 21:34.082
Oh, well,
perhaps they won't make it.

21:34.084 --> 21:37.785
Gentlemen, step
that way, please.

21:39.120 --> 21:43.322
This is delicious.
Absolutely delicious.

21:44.091 --> 21:46.191
Enough, enough, enough.
Out of my way.

21:46.193 --> 21:49.460
I'll give you a few minutes
to get out of these

21:49.462 --> 21:52.062
before I start
filling that.

21:52.064 --> 21:56.066
And if you remain afloat for
an hour, you go absolutely free.

21:56.068 --> 21:58.368
Now what more
could you ask?

21:58.370 --> 22:00.236
I still suspect some trick.

22:00.238 --> 22:02.538
Now, now,
let's not be bitter.

22:02.540 --> 22:06.575
I think we should give him the
benefit of the doubt, Robin..

22:06.577 --> 22:08.410
...until he
proves otherwise.

22:08.412 --> 22:11.346
- 'It's only fair.'
- 'I suppose you're right.'

22:11.348 --> 22:12.980
Of course, he's right.

22:12.982 --> 22:16.350
Uh, gentlemen, be my guests..

22:17.253 --> 22:18.819
Would you?

22:21.957 --> 22:24.824
Come, my darling.

22:27.527 --> 22:31.162
- Holy smokestack.
- 'What a spot to get out of?'

22:31.164 --> 22:32.897
'Right, Batman.'

22:32.899 --> 22:35.532
'There are only two ways
to get outta there.'

22:35.534 --> 22:37.000
'One, I let you out'

22:37.002 --> 22:41.304
'and two, you jump
50 feet straight up.'

22:42.307 --> 22:47.076
You still intend to free us if
we can stay afloat for an hour?

22:47.078 --> 22:49.111
Oh, dear me.

22:49.113 --> 22:50.946
Surely you don't
think I'd joke about

22:50.948 --> 22:54.149
such a serious matter
as that, do you?

22:54.151 --> 22:55.350
No.

22:55.352 --> 22:59.320
Oh, time to start
filling the tank.

23:02.157 --> 23:03.289
'But that's gas.'

23:03.291 --> 23:05.991
'I do believe you're right.'

23:06.994 --> 23:10.095
'But then who said
anything about water?'

23:11.465 --> 23:14.332
- But you can't float in gas!
- No.

23:14.334 --> 23:16.367
But you can drown in it.

23:17.903 --> 23:20.169
Oh, Joker,
that's a dirty trick.

23:20.171 --> 23:21.203
Oh, forget it, Jill.

23:21.205 --> 23:26.074
You didn't really think I was
gonna pass up a chance like this

23:26.076 --> 23:27.942
did you, my peerless pair?

23:27.944 --> 23:32.212
'Play traitor to all my
principles and friends?'

23:32.214 --> 23:33.279
'Oh ho ho, no.'

23:34.315 --> 23:37.316
Ah, but one last word of advice

23:37.318 --> 23:39.484
don't stir it up.

23:39.618 --> 23:42.953
Too narrow in here
to use the Bat-rope.

23:45.222 --> 23:47.189
There's nothing
for them to catch on.

23:47.191 --> 23:51.326
And he's neutralized the rest of
the stuff in the utility belt.

23:51.328 --> 23:54.128
What are we going to do?

23:54.362 --> 23:58.198
Unless there's someone
to help us..

23:58.400 --> 24:00.099
...I don't know.

24:00.101 --> 24:01.800
<i> But help from where?</i>

24:01.802 --> 24:04.836
<i> Not The Joker, certainly!</i>

24:06.906 --> 24:10.540
<i> And no one else</i>
<i> knows where they are.</i>

24:13.477 --> 24:16.912
<i> Is this The Joker's</i>
<i> crowning jest?</i>

24:16.914 --> 24:19.114
<i> Find out tomorrow night</i>

24:19.116 --> 24:21.983
<i> same time, same channel.</i>

24:21.985 --> 24:28.022
<i> But be prepared,</i>
<i> no help is likely to come.</i>
