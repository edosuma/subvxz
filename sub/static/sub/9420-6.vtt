06:11.972 --> 06:13.872
>> get over here.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.173
All right.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.074
Don't let him get in your head,

06:16.076 --> 06:16.641
All right?

06:16.643 --> 06:18.310
Just keep your feet moving.

06:18.312 --> 06:18.977
Give him the one-two.

06:18.979 --> 06:19.845
Go for the gut.

06:19.847 --> 06:20.512
Now get in there!

06:20.514 --> 06:21.613
Get in there!

06:21.615 --> 06:22.414
>> [puffing]

06:22.416 --> 06:23.482
>> yes.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.916
Go left.

06:24.918 --> 06:25.584
Yep.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.251
>> all right, cool.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.185
Let's sit down

06:27.187 --> 06:29.921
And take a load off.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.256
>> you're fast.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.224
I noticed that over there.

06:32.226 --> 06:34.092
>> yeah, i did track, football,

06:34.094 --> 06:35.894
Cross-country, wrestling.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.863
I had a few scholarships

06:37.865 --> 06:39.164
To play, but i got injured,

06:39.166 --> 06:40.098
And i lost it all--

06:40.100 --> 06:41.066
Like, pretty much, like,

06:41.068 --> 06:42.033
All the schools,

06:42.035 --> 06:44.236
And gave that up and started

06:44.238 --> 06:46.571
Trying to find other ways

06:46.573 --> 06:49.007
Of providing for my family.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.208
>> what's your family like?

06:50.210 --> 06:52.577
>> we're actually pretty close.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.979
We all live within

06:53.981 --> 06:55.747
The same block.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.915
We buy land, and we all built

06:56.917 --> 06:58.884
Our own houses on our land.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.519
My sisters, they bought

07:00.521 --> 07:01.453
Their land, and they built

07:01.455 --> 07:02.554
Their houses there.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.422
>> and do they have families?

07:03.424 --> 07:04.423
>> yeah.

07:04.425 --> 07:05.957
And i bought me one,

07:05.959 --> 07:07.492
And i'm ready to build a house

07:07.494 --> 07:09.728
With my future wife and kids.

07:09.730 --> 07:10.529
>> wow, so you're already

07:10.531 --> 07:11.263
Sort of thinking about...

07:11.265 --> 07:11.930
>> yeah.

07:11.932 --> 07:12.631
>> settling down and...

07:12.633 --> 07:13.265
>> yeah.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.032
>> having a little house.

07:14.034 --> 07:14.766
>> even if it was just

07:14.768 --> 07:16.368
A small house, but it would be--

07:16.370 --> 07:17.469
It'd be our home.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.537
>> do you think that jasmin

07:18.539 --> 07:19.204
Could be the person?

07:19.206 --> 07:20.071
>> yeah.

07:20.073 --> 07:20.972
Me and her can build

07:20.974 --> 07:22.841
A home together.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.009
The way we talk, she sound like

07:24.011 --> 07:25.610
She's down, you know?

07:25.612 --> 07:26.445
>> do you have a picture of her?

07:26.447 --> 07:27.145
>> yeah.

07:27.147 --> 07:27.979
>> okay.

07:27.981 --> 07:28.947
>> all right, wait.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.048
Hold on. Time-out.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.049
Let's see this.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.517
>> whew.

07:32.519 --> 07:34.886
Va-va-voom.

07:34.888 --> 07:35.821
Cute.

07:35.823 --> 07:36.755
>> yeah, wow.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.223
>> wow. Oh, my god.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.357
>> i mean, those boobs are

07:39.359 --> 07:41.126
Bigger than you.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.661
>> yeah.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.329
>> how much of your attraction

07:44.331 --> 07:45.497
To her has to do with the way

07:45.499 --> 07:46.731
She looks versus, like,

07:46.733 --> 07:48.099
The way you guys talk

07:48.101 --> 07:48.867
And how you feel about her?

07:48.869 --> 07:50.035
>> like, i'm attracted to her,

07:50.037 --> 07:51.136
Like, very, but it's more--

07:51.138 --> 07:52.204
I get more attracted

07:52.206 --> 07:53.371
To the talking

07:53.373 --> 07:54.573
Once i find out

07:54.575 --> 07:55.674
How the person is.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.576
>> so what jasmin represents

07:57.578 --> 08:00.278
For you is, like, a major piece

08:00.280 --> 08:01.446
In the sort of puzzle that

08:01.448 --> 08:02.314
You're trying to put together

08:02.316 --> 08:02.914
Of your life.

08:02.916 --> 08:03.582
>> yeah.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.983
>> that dream kind of involves

08:04.985 --> 08:06.952
Meeting this girl and making

08:06.954 --> 08:08.019
Sure she's legit.

08:08.021 --> 08:08.687
>> yeah.

08:08.689 --> 08:09.754
>> and do your friends

08:09.756 --> 08:11.423
And family--do they know

08:11.425 --> 08:12.491
About jasmin?

08:12.493 --> 08:13.859
Are they skeptical?

08:13.861 --> 08:14.759
>> a little bit.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.595
>> are you skeptical?

08:16.597 --> 08:17.362
>> yeah.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.029
>> yeah?

08:18.031 --> 08:19.130
>> like, just the simple fact

08:19.132 --> 08:20.198
That she just won't even pick up

08:20.200 --> 08:21.700
The phone and just say, "hey."

08:21.702 --> 08:22.367
>> right.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.335
>> you know, just let me

08:23.337 --> 08:24.169
Hear her voice.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.303
Even if it's not her, and if

08:25.305 --> 08:27.305
It's just another girl,

08:27.307 --> 08:27.973
Then i would be like,

08:27.975 --> 08:29.140
"okay, well, you know what?

08:29.142 --> 08:30.242
We've built

08:30.244 --> 08:32.344
This emotional relationship.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.144
Let's see what we can do

08:33.145 --> 08:34.379
With it."

08:34.381 --> 08:35.447
>> we're pulling for you, but

08:35.448 --> 08:36.448
We want to find out the truth,

08:36.450 --> 08:38.082
Whatever that is.

08:38.085 --> 08:38.750
>> cool.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.885
>> all right, man.

08:40.888 --> 08:41.820
>> all right.

08:41.822 --> 08:42.621
>> good to meet you.

08:42.623 --> 08:46.525
>> same here.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.393
>> i think he's underplaying how

08:48.395 --> 08:50.662
Important her looks are.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.364
But i really like this kid.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.331
He's sweet.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.534
He's got a sweet dream.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.002
>> his life in the next

08:57.004 --> 08:59.170
5, 10, 15 years is hinged on

08:59.172 --> 09:00.338
A successful, strong

09:00.340 --> 09:01.306
Relationship.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.108
But nothing about

09:03.110 --> 09:04.509
His relationship with jasmin

09:04.511 --> 09:05.677
Suggests that she is who

09:05.679 --> 09:07.312
She says she is.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.786
>> all right,
time to investigate.

09:14.788 --> 09:15.203
Time to investigate.

09:15.204 --> 09:15.619
>> it's been a little while.

09:15.622 --> 09:16.288
>> yeah.

09:16.290 --> 09:16.988
>> don't forget...

09:16.990 --> 09:17.622
>> my fingers are

09:17.624 --> 09:18.290
A little rusty.

09:18.292 --> 09:18.990
>> i'm the captain.

09:18.992 --> 09:19.858
>> [laughs]

09:19.860 --> 09:20.759
We know how--

09:20.761 --> 09:21.560
>> you're the notetaker.

09:21.562 --> 09:22.327
>> but it takes longer when

09:22.329 --> 09:23.094
You're searching.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.363
>> no, you get to watch

09:25.365 --> 09:26.565
And think while i'm doing

09:26.567 --> 09:27.732
The grunt work, and then

09:27.734 --> 09:28.934
You have these great ideas,

09:28.936 --> 09:30.235
Which are great, but only

09:30.237 --> 09:31.970
Because you've had the luxury of

09:31.972 --> 09:33.405
Sitting there observing.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.506
>> [laughs]

09:34.508 --> 09:35.807
>> so here's what we got.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.309
We've got a guy, felipe,

09:37.311 --> 09:39.544
Who thinks he could be in love

09:39.546 --> 09:40.679
With jasmin.

09:40.681 --> 09:41.413
They've never spoken

09:41.415 --> 09:42.080
On the phone.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.515
He's starting to plan a future

09:43.517 --> 09:44.482
With someone he has no idea

09:44.484 --> 09:45.150
Who they are.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.952
>> he's literally "plotting"

09:46.954 --> 09:47.619
This future.

09:47.621 --> 09:48.286
>> right.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.187
>> the first thing we're clearly

09:49.189 --> 09:51.856
Going to do is prove or disprove

09:51.858 --> 09:53.224
That the girl in the pictures

09:53.226 --> 09:54.759
Is the girl he's talking to.

09:54.761 --> 09:55.594
>> so just looking at her

09:55.596 --> 09:56.261
Facebook page,

09:56.263 --> 09:58.363
Right off the bat--let's see.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.531
>> it's a lot of sexually

09:59.533 --> 10:01.066
Suggestive pictures.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.134
>> wow, 576 people liked this

10:03.136 --> 10:04.035
Picture she posted.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.904
1,000 people liked this picture.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.072
Wow, she gets a lot of,

10:07.074 --> 10:08.573
Like, attention.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.575
>> let's run an image search.

10:10.577 --> 10:13.211

10:18.285 --> 10:19.017
A fake account too.

10:19.019 --> 10:19.784
It's just tons and tons

10:19.786 --> 10:20.352
Of pictures.

It's got some videos.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.868
From just outside los angeles,

Nba player,

11:11.838 --> 11:14.406
Chris 'birdman' andersen.

11:14.408 --> 11:15.907
Both andersen and roxanne

11:15.909 --> 11:17.575
Believed they were sending

11:17.577 --> 11:19.844
Each other messages and starting

11:19.846 --> 11:21.846
An intimate relationship,

11:21.848 --> 11:23.181
But their messages were being

11:23.183 --> 11:24.749
Filtered through chartier's fake

11:24.751 --> 11:26.985
Profile pages, which meant she

11:26.987 --> 11:28.119
Could manipulate any of their

11:28.121 --> 11:32.791
Messages, and she did, often.

11:32.793 --> 11:33.858
Eventually, a meeting was

11:33.860 --> 11:35.627
Arranged between andersen

11:35.629 --> 11:37.028
And paris roxanne.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.430
They spent a few days together

11:38.432 --> 11:41.499
In denver, had consensual sex,

11:41.501 --> 11:43.435
And then roxanne went home.

11:43.437 --> 11:44.536
When the pair stopped

11:44.538 --> 11:45.704
Communicating, shelly lynne

11:45.706 --> 11:48.206
Lashed out like a scorned lover.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.774
She blackmailed andersen for

11:49.776 --> 11:50.842
Hush money by posing as

11:50.844 --> 11:52.777
Roxanne's mother.

11:52.779 --> 11:53.611
'i know what you did,'

11:53.613 --> 11:54.479
She told andersen.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.947
The legal age of consent in

11:55.949 --> 11:57.248
Colorado is 17.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.616
Andersen knew he hadn't broken

11:58.618 --> 12:00.318
