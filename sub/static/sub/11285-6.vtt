THEY'RE MAKING YOU SAY THIS.

36:34.526 --> 36:35.926
HE THINKS
YOU'RE MAKING ME SAY THIS.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.430
NO, THEY'RE NOT.
I PROMISE.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.333
<i> WHAT I DID TODAY,</i>
<i> IT WAS WRONG.</i>

36:43.335 --> 36:44.868
IT'S MY FAULT,
NOT THEIRS.

36:45.804 --> 36:47.771
<i> I THOUGHT THAT WE NEEDED</i>
<i> TO STAY HERE</i>

36:47.773 --> 36:49.806
<i> BECAUSE IT FELT SAFE;</i>

36:49.808 --> 36:53.276
THAT YOU'RE CLOSE TO YOUR MOM
AND YOUR DAD.

36:54.213 --> 36:58.281

IT'S ALL WE HAVE.

37:00.352 --> 37:03.253

IS ALL WE HAVE.

37:03.255 --> 37:06.656
(SIGNING)
BUT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.559
HE UH...
HE KNOWS I'M GOING TO JAIL.

37:12.764 --> 37:15.398
WE'LL BE TOGETHER AGAIN.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.766
MAYBE NOT NOW,
BUT SOON.

37:17.703 --> 37:21.438
<i> I PROMISE I'LL ALWAYS BE</i>
<i> IN YOUR LIFE.</i>

37:24.476 --> 37:26.476
YOU'LL NEVER BE ALONE.

37:27.412 --> 37:28.478
(CRYING)

37:31.283 --> 37:33.350
PLEASE PUT DOWN THE GUN.

37:41.793 --> 37:42.859

37:45.430 --> 37:47.430
¶¶¶

37:47.432 --> 37:49.866
¶ Well, heaven knows I'd wait ¶

37:55.707 --> 37:59.342
¶ Just to feel another breeze ¶

38:04.483 --> 38:08.285
¶ To lie beneath another sun ¶

38:13.392 --> 38:15.325
¶ Deep down in your heart ¶

38:16.061 --> 38:17.894
SERGEANT, THOSE TWO
GOING TO PRISON

38:17.896 --> 38:19.996

ANYBODY.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.848
SENATOR, COLE REALIZED

38:21.849 --> 38:23.699

A HUGE MISTAKE TODAY.

38:23.702 --> 38:24.701
HE DID EVERYTHING
HE COULD

38:24.703 --> 38:26.603
TO HELP US FIND YOU.

38:26.605 --> 38:29.372
I'LL MAKE SURE THE COURTS
ARE FULLY INFORMED.

38:29.374 --> 38:34.544
¶ Big hearts are warming up
the coldest years ¶

38:37.983 --> 38:42.819
¶ And they lie beside me
forevermore ¶

38:48.360 --> 38:50.794
¶ And big hearts
make mine grow ¶

39:01.406 --> 39:04.407
¶ Growing every day ¶

39:18.090 --> 39:19.356
(SIGHS)

39:19.358 --> 39:22.359
ALL RIGHT,

39:22.361 --> 39:25.428
(SIGHS) DAD...

39:25.430 --> 39:26.863
I DON'T WANNA GO
TO UNIVERSITY.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.733
I WANNA BE A COP,
AND I WANNA GO TO THE ACADEMY.

39:34.005 --> 39:36.573
WELL, WHEN DID YOU MAKE
THIS DECISION?

39:36.575 --> 39:39.075
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT AWHILE.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.078
OKAY...

39:43.749 --> 39:46.149
WELL, A DEGREE WILL
ONLY HELP YOU.

39:47.085 --> 39:49.336
I CAN DO A DEGREE LATER.

39:49.337 --> 39:51.588
THIS JOB, DEAN,
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.523
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
YOU GO THROUGH A LOT.

39:53.525 --> 39:55.158
I SEE WHAT YOU DO
EVERY DAY-

39:55.160 --> 39:56.326
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

39:56.327 --> 39:57.493
YOU DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION
IT TAKES

39:57.496 --> 39:58.561
TO MAKE THIS DECISION.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.174
I DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

40:00.175 --> 40:01.786
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME?
NO!

40:01.787 --> 40:03.398
NO, YOU'D BE GREAT
AT ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

40:03.402 --> 40:04.467
I WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU,
I WANNA HELP-

40:04.469 --> 40:05.986
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME?

40:05.987 --> 40:07.504
PARKER:
SO YOU HAVE CHOICES,
SO YOU HAVE MORE FREEDOM LATER.

40:07.506 --> 40:10.507
JUST, JUST GIVE IT TIME.
JUST GIVE IT TIME.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.509
<i> DEAN:</i>
<i> I HAVE GIVEN IT TIME.</i>

40:12.511 --> 40:14.144
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS.

40:14.146 --> 40:16.713
THIS IS WHAT I WAS BORN TO DO.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.519
(CHAIR SCRAPES BACK)

40:25.490 --> 40:28.558
YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT YOU...

40:28.560 --> 40:30.427
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY.

40:30.429 --> 40:31.995
SON...

40:31.997 --> 40:33.930
(ANGRILY) JUST...
I'M GOING FOR A WALK.
