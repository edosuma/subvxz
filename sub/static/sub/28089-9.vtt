<i>Previously on
Doom Patrol...</i>

00:22.092 --> 00:23.995
<i>I believe
you can find people</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:25.797
<i>who will love you
just as you are.</i>

00:25.830 --> 00:28.533
When did Kay Challis
become Jane?

00:28.565 --> 00:31.169
<i>You are one
of many personalities,</i>

00:31.202 --> 00:32.936
<i>trapped within a single body.</i>

00:32.969 --> 00:34.204
Holy shit.

00:34.237 --> 00:36.207
<i>The Underground is vast.</i>

00:36.240 --> 00:39.143
What do you know
about the Underground?

00:39.176 --> 00:40.688
Not a lot.
Maybe I can help you.

00:40.712 --> 00:43.279
<i>Sweet, sweet baby.</i>

00:43.280 --> 00:44.848
<i>Please don't keep me waiting.</i>

00:44.881 --> 00:46.350
<i>Come, join me!</i>

00:46.384 --> 00:49.119
<i>Karen. She's by far
the worst of the 64.</i>

00:49.152 --> 00:50.420
<i>Jane, are you in there?</i>

00:50.454 --> 00:52.990
Let go of me, you motherfucker!

00:53.024 --> 00:57.673
<i>Hey, Jane. Jane.</i>

02:34.558 --> 02:37.860
Sweet, sweet, baby Kay.

02:39.096 --> 02:42.332
Come give Daddy a kiss.

02:42.366 --> 02:47.104
I haven't finished
my puzzle yet.

02:47.138 --> 02:51.241
Kay Olivia.

02:51.275 --> 02:56.275
You know Daddy
doesn't like to wait.

03:29.247 --> 03:30.896
Get off me!

03:49.366 --> 03:51.868
Playtime's over, Karen.
You've had your fun.

03:57.175 --> 04:02.175
<i>♪ Oh, Polly, Pretty Polly
Come and go with me... ♪</i>

04:03.847 --> 04:05.317
Shut up.

04:05.349 --> 04:10.349
<i>♪ Oh, Polly, Pretty Polly
You guessed it just right ♪</i>

04:11.020 --> 04:12.522
I said shut up!

04:12.556 --> 04:15.859
<i>♪ I dug on your grave... ♪</i>

04:18.762 --> 04:22.567
- That's enough, Polly.
- She started it!

04:22.600 --> 04:26.536
Fuck all you
do-nothing, hater bitches!

04:26.571 --> 04:28.738
At least I found true love.

04:33.144 --> 04:34.444
Where are you taking her?

04:34.478 --> 04:35.646
You know.

04:44.754 --> 04:48.125
Jane?

04:48.158 --> 04:50.961
Jane?

04:50.995 --> 04:55.199
Jane. Hey, sweetheart.

04:56.300 --> 05:00.137
Okay. Okay.

05:00.170 --> 05:02.706
Why aren't you up there?

05:02.740 --> 05:04.675
Why aren't you up there, Polly?

05:04.709 --> 05:07.012
Someone needs
to be on the surface, Jane.

05:07.045 --> 05:09.880
You're creating disharmony.
Dissonance.

05:09.913 --> 05:12.716
Well, the position's open,
Lucy, have at it.

05:12.750 --> 05:16.220
You can get us all on the same
wavelength you care so much about.

05:16.252 --> 05:17.822
Jane, hon.

05:17.855 --> 05:20.024
We all know
how this works here, right?

05:20.057 --> 05:23.228
There are rules, right?

05:23.261 --> 05:25.930
You're the primary, which means
you're the one on top.

05:25.963 --> 05:29.266
Which keeps an equilibrium
down here in the Underground.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.569
An equilibrium
that must be maintained.

05:31.601 --> 05:33.038
Yeah, 'cause we're all besties.

05:33.071 --> 05:35.271
Loved your friendship
bracelet, Secretary.

05:35.305 --> 05:37.073
This a joke to you?

05:37.074 --> 05:38.043
Just do your job.

05:38.044 --> 05:41.612
The fuck you know
about my job, Polly?

05:41.646 --> 05:43.413
When's the last time
you were up there?

05:43.447 --> 05:45.048
Oh, that's right, never.

05:45.081 --> 05:47.918
- Fuck you.
- Polly.

05:47.951 --> 05:52.423
Jane,
each of us has a purpose.

05:52.456 --> 05:55.459
A reason for being.

05:55.492 --> 05:58.762
We just want you
to respect that.

05:58.795 --> 05:59.997
I know.

06:00.031 --> 06:02.365
The more things
remain out of balance,

06:02.399 --> 06:07.399
the more all of us
are vulnerable.

06:17.348 --> 06:21.951
Okay, I'll go up.

06:48.144 --> 06:51.482
You look like shit.

06:51.500 --> 06:55.485
I feel like shit.

06:55.519 --> 06:58.221
You ever think about going
up to the surface?

06:58.254 --> 07:01.091
Me? No.

07:01.125 --> 07:03.394
I'm happy with my job.

07:03.427 --> 07:05.096
You're lucky.

07:05.129 --> 07:06.798
Can't say there
haven't been a few times

07:06.831 --> 07:09.666
where I stared out
at the end of the line.

07:09.701 --> 07:12.603
Stared at that light
and thought,

07:12.637 --> 07:16.273
"What if?"

07:16.307 --> 07:20.744
But, you know, it passes.

07:20.745 --> 07:22.480
Everybody wants me there.

07:22.512 --> 07:25.750
"It's your job.
We all have a purpose."

07:25.783 --> 07:28.619
Like it's easy being up there,
like it's a cakewalk.

07:28.653 --> 07:31.088
Shit's hard as fuck.

07:31.122 --> 07:36.122
- And even then, it can't fix everything.
- I hear you.

07:36.194 --> 07:39.564
- And what's the point, really?
- Who knows?

07:39.596 --> 07:43.346
All I know is this train.

07:51.576 --> 07:55.144
- You ever use that?
- Emergency brake?

07:55.178 --> 07:56.581
Never had a reason to.

07:56.613 --> 07:58.516
I run a pretty clean railroad.

07:58.548 --> 08:02.987
What happens
if someone pulls it?

08:03.021 --> 08:05.555
I would imagine
it would fuck up the train.

08:05.589 --> 08:09.189
- Huh.
- Until I fixed it.

08:11.194 --> 08:14.944
How long would that take?

08:16.300 --> 08:20.266
How much time do you need?

08:25.043 --> 08:28.279
Jane, are you listening?

08:28.312 --> 08:31.382
We really, really, really,
need you to come out.

08:31.415 --> 08:34.552
Didn't work
the first ten times you tried it,

08:34.585 --> 08:36.019
but sure, why not?

08:36.053 --> 08:39.124
At least I'm doing something.

08:39.157 --> 08:40.892
I've never seen her
like this before.

08:40.924 --> 08:42.527
Has anybody seen her
like this before?

08:42.528 --> 08:45.230
This is all my fault, I never
should have pushed us into therapy.

08:45.263 --> 08:49.700
Don't flatter yourself, Cliff,
therapy was the rat's idea.

08:49.734 --> 08:52.503
Jane, sweetie,
blink if you can hear me.

08:52.504 --> 08:53.970
Jesus, Rita,
will you give it a rest?

08:53.971 --> 08:55.974
I'll do no such thing.

08:56.006 --> 08:57.642
I can't believe
I lost Jane.

08:57.674 --> 09:00.010
You didn't lose her.
She's not a pet.

09:00.043 --> 09:02.046
Okay, now Larry hates me, too.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.081
Of course, I deserve this.
This is good.

09:04.115 --> 09:07.519
There's absolutely nothing wrong with her.

09:07.552 --> 09:11.387
Her brain activity's off the
charts and yet... nothing.

09:11.388 --> 09:12.721
Jane's in there,
somewhere.

09:12.722 --> 09:14.357
So how do we
pull her out?

09:14.359 --> 09:15.559
I don't know.

09:15.561 --> 09:17.427
Part of me wishes that we could
just shrink ourselves,

09:17.428 --> 09:22.428
<i>Magic School Bus</i> style,
and get inside her head.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.336
What?

09:24.369 --> 09:28.138
I'm just marveling at your embrace
of the weird and utterly impossible.

09:37.147 --> 09:39.096
What?

10:20.457 --> 10:24.207
What the hell's going on?

11:35.765 --> 11:37.701
Okay.

11:37.735 --> 11:41.706
Can someone tell me what the...

11:41.739 --> 11:44.240
Hey! Hello? Uh...

11:44.274 --> 11:46.143
Hey!

11:46.176 --> 11:47.812
Jane?

12:00.390 --> 12:02.894
Hello?

12:02.927 --> 12:05.361
I'm not Jane.

12:05.395 --> 12:06.395
What?

12:06.397 --> 12:09.100
I'm Driver 8.

12:09.133 --> 12:11.301
- Who are you?
- Cliff Steele.

12:14.538 --> 12:15.840
I thought
you were a robot.

12:15.873 --> 12:18.243
I was.
Well, I mean, I am.

12:18.275 --> 12:20.210
I'm sorry... Are you
sure you're not Jane?

12:20.244 --> 12:22.413
I'm not Jane.

12:22.446 --> 12:23.413
Where am I?

12:23.447 --> 12:25.015
The Underground.

12:25.048 --> 12:28.086
I'm in the Under...

12:28.119 --> 12:32.155
I'm in Jane's brain?
I'm in her head?

12:32.190 --> 12:34.958
Bad news is...
it's off limits.

12:34.991 --> 12:36.894
You're not supposed
to be here.

12:36.927 --> 12:40.264
- How did you...
<i>- Magic School Bus.</i>

12:41.499 --> 12:45.035
Um, the Negative Spirit
is touching my brain right now

12:45.068 --> 12:48.471
as well as Jane's brain
at the same time

12:48.504 --> 12:51.609
and... here I am.

12:51.642 --> 12:55.078
I don't understand it either.

12:55.113 --> 12:57.981
So, you're one
of the personalities?

12:58.014 --> 13:01.418
I am. Some of us look
like Jane, some don't.

13:01.452 --> 13:04.556
As you say, I don't
understand it all either.

13:04.589 --> 13:07.892
Can you help me find Jane?
I'm here to bring her back.

13:07.924 --> 13:10.561
Oh, I wouldn't know
where to look.

13:10.562 --> 13:12.330
This is a big place
down here.

13:12.363 --> 13:15.232
Lots of places to get lost.
And I don't leave the train.

13:15.265 --> 13:20.265
You sure there isn't anybody
who could help?

13:24.975 --> 13:28.426
Let me make some calls.

14:00.977 --> 14:03.980
Jane?

14:04.014 --> 14:06.850
What are you doing here?

14:06.884 --> 14:08.485
Oh, d'you hear?

14:08.519 --> 14:11.089
Someone pulled the emergency
brake on the train.

14:11.121 --> 14:13.157
- You're kidding.
- Hardly.

14:13.191 --> 14:15.360
The train's completely out
of commission.

14:15.393 --> 14:18.428
No one can surface
until Driver 8 fixes it.

14:18.461 --> 14:19.998
That's crazy.

14:20.032 --> 14:25.032
You know, I've always assumed I was the
only one that knew about this memory.

14:25.102 --> 14:28.972
Like it was my own
Secret Garden.

14:29.005 --> 14:31.008
But I don't mind the company.

14:31.042 --> 14:33.878
Not at all.
Rather like it, actually.

14:33.910 --> 14:35.379
Whose memory is this?

14:35.413 --> 14:40.183
I don't know. Never given
it a second thought.

14:40.217 --> 14:41.985
I know this much...

14:42.019 --> 14:43.720
It's my favorite place
in the Underground.

14:43.721 --> 14:46.924
I always leave completely
chuffed without fail.

14:46.958 --> 14:49.994
It doesn't bother you that you
don't know who this belongs to?

14:50.027 --> 14:52.129
Memories belong to everyone.

14:52.163 --> 14:57.163
That's how it works here.
Everyone knows that.

14:59.971 --> 15:04.971
Some of the others are saying
you don't want to go back up.

15:07.879 --> 15:12.615
Do you ever feel like you're
spiraling out of control?

15:12.649 --> 15:14.751
When I get like that...

15:14.784 --> 15:17.589
I come here.

15:17.621 --> 15:22.621
And what happens when
that doesn't work anymore?

15:28.198 --> 15:30.033
You're leaving?

15:30.067 --> 15:31.902
Where are you going?

15:31.936 --> 15:33.070
Jane?

15:33.104 --> 15:35.504
To find answers.

15:51.654 --> 15:53.557
Hey, shit-for-brains.

15:53.590 --> 15:54.725
Hammerhead.

15:54.758 --> 15:55.993
Yeah, Einstein.

15:57.595 --> 16:00.429
I never thought that
I'd be happy to see you.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.067
You're not supposed
to be here, Cliff.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.602
I'm looking for Jane.

16:05.636 --> 16:08.873
- Driver 8 said you'd help...
- Shut up!

16:08.905 --> 16:10.806
Excuse me,
who the fuck are you?

16:11.775 --> 16:13.076
Driller Bill, asshole.

16:14.110 --> 16:15.480
I'm trying to help her.

16:15.513 --> 16:17.514
Well, that just got fucked
sideways, didn't it?

16:17.548 --> 16:22.386
Heh...

16:22.419 --> 16:25.602
All right. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Watch the coat.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.765
So nice of you
to join us, Jane.

17:06.798 --> 17:11.798
- Quite nice indeed.
- To seek counsel.

17:13.435 --> 17:15.105
Sit.

17:23.615 --> 17:25.281
You can't do this.

17:28.318 --> 17:31.021
You're making a big mistake,
Hammerhead.

17:31.055 --> 17:35.159
Hey!

17:35.192 --> 17:37.994
Ooh. Ah.

17:44.234 --> 17:48.038
Don't mind her.
She's harmless.

17:48.039 --> 17:49.039
Karen?

17:54.644 --> 17:57.214
Cliffie?

17:57.248 --> 18:00.518
You're human now?

18:00.551 --> 18:04.454
Don't ask me
to explain it.

18:04.489 --> 18:09.326
I think it works...
kind of.

18:09.359 --> 18:10.794
What happened to you?

18:10.827 --> 18:12.329
Oh, well.

18:12.363 --> 18:15.464
Turns out weddings aren't
really a thing around here.

18:15.499 --> 18:17.568
Haters.

18:17.602 --> 18:21.204
Actually, what the all-fuck
are you doing here?

18:21.239 --> 18:23.207
I'm here for Jane.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.042
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

18:25.076 --> 18:28.613
Is this like some grand
romantic gesture or something?

18:28.645 --> 18:32.182
You're really going
the extra mile here, Cliffie.

18:32.215 --> 18:34.651
You're in her head.

18:34.684 --> 18:35.885
That's deep.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.689
Oh, no. I'm here for Jane.

18:37.721 --> 18:40.825
She's in a lot of trouble.
She needs my help.

18:40.858 --> 18:43.693
This isn't you trying
to win her back?

18:43.727 --> 18:45.029
No, this is...

18:45.063 --> 18:50.063
me trying to fix a big,
dumb mistake that I made.

18:54.505 --> 18:59.505
You know she's never going to
give you what you want, right?

18:59.676 --> 19:04.676
She'll never give you
what Dougie and I have.

19:06.584 --> 19:10.988
What do you and Doug have?

19:11.020 --> 19:13.124
Everyone's afraid
to be normal.

19:13.156 --> 19:15.856
All these bitches.

19:18.296 --> 19:21.999
But they don't know.

19:22.031 --> 19:26.403
They don't know.

19:26.436 --> 19:28.472
No need
for the unease, my dear.

19:28.506 --> 19:30.307
We are all sisters here.

19:30.340 --> 19:33.044
I'm sensing you feel lost.

19:33.077 --> 19:36.980
And this feeling makes it hard for
you to return to the surface.

19:36.981 --> 19:37.981
We cannot help you...

19:37.982 --> 19:40.084
But we can
guide you, however...

19:40.085 --> 19:42.153
You must
do the work...

19:42.185 --> 19:43.886
You need to replenish.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.423
You need to go deeper.

19:45.455 --> 19:46.557
Go to the Well.

19:46.590 --> 19:49.426
- The Well...
- ...is the answer.

19:49.460 --> 19:51.295
- That is all.
- Go.

19:51.328 --> 19:54.030
- Deeper.
- To the Well.

19:54.064 --> 19:55.114
But I...

20:04.307 --> 20:05.609
You're following me?

20:05.643 --> 20:07.444
I was in the neighborhood.

20:07.478 --> 20:09.181
- I swear.
- Whatever.

20:09.213 --> 20:14.213
They... She... Whatever that
thing is in there, it's nutters.

20:14.352 --> 20:15.753
Goodbye, Penny.

20:15.787 --> 20:18.856
The Well? Seriously? Was Russian
Roulette not an option?

20:18.890 --> 20:22.325
What do you want? Why are you here?
Fuck it, why do you care?

20:22.326 --> 20:23.385
If you don't go up,

20:23.386 --> 20:26.063
it's only a matter of time
before they ask someone like me.

20:26.096 --> 20:28.133
And? What's the problem?

20:28.165 --> 20:31.536
Look at you! You're not exactly
a bleeding endorsement.

20:31.568 --> 20:33.471
'Cause it sucks up there.

20:33.503 --> 20:34.610
It's chaotic.

20:34.611 --> 20:38.875
You don't know who to believe, or what
to believe, or when to believe it.

20:38.909 --> 20:42.279
So, take a break.

20:42.313 --> 20:45.383
Go back to the lake.
Anything.

20:45.415 --> 20:49.954
But don't go to the Well.

20:49.988 --> 20:52.355
- Miranda was looking for answers, too.
- I'm not Miranda.

20:52.390 --> 20:55.993
Point is, they told her
the same thing.

20:56.027 --> 20:59.028
The Sisters want everyone
to go to the Well.

20:59.063 --> 21:00.530
It's a bad idea.

21:00.565 --> 21:03.634
So come with me.
Strength in numbers.

21:03.667 --> 21:07.638
You know I can't do that.
I stay clear of danger.

21:07.672 --> 21:10.307
I run. That's my job.

21:10.340 --> 21:13.641
Exactly. So, fuck off.

21:20.785 --> 21:22.853
Hey, you can't keep me here.

21:22.885 --> 21:25.756
You cooled off?

21:25.788 --> 21:26.991
Come with me.

21:27.025 --> 21:29.259
- Where are you taking her?
- Up your ass, maybe.

21:32.763 --> 21:36.133
I meant what I said, Cliff.

21:36.134 --> 21:37.468
She's not worth it.

21:37.501 --> 21:38.536
You're wrong.

21:38.568 --> 21:40.038
Hey! Why does
she get to leave?

21:40.070 --> 21:43.207
I'm the one whose actually
trying to help here, Hammerhead.

21:47.711 --> 21:51.011
Son of a...

22:40.330 --> 22:44.934
Jane!

22:48.172 --> 22:49.440
Jane.

22:49.472 --> 22:51.040
Jane, are you still mad at me?

22:52.076 --> 22:54.211
I'm sorry.
I really am.

22:54.244 --> 22:56.247
It was stupid.

22:57.314 --> 23:01.352
Hello, Cliff.
It's me, Penny.

23:01.384 --> 23:03.921
Penny Farthing.

23:03.953 --> 23:05.856
Penny.

23:05.890 --> 23:08.491
Hey, what happened
to your, your...

23:08.526 --> 23:09.727
- Stammer?
- Yeah.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.494
Only when I'm on the surface.

23:11.528 --> 23:12.630
Comes with my...

23:12.663 --> 23:15.432
general anxiety.

23:15.465 --> 23:18.068
Listen, Jane's in trouble.

23:18.103 --> 23:22.640
Or rather, she will be
if we don't get to her in time.

23:22.673 --> 23:24.240
She's right there.

23:24.275 --> 23:26.376
- Sorry?
- Turn around.

23:26.410 --> 23:28.445
Oh, that's not Jane.

23:28.479 --> 23:30.181
Well, it is,

23:30.213 --> 23:32.349
but it isn't.

23:32.383 --> 23:33.451
That's a memory.

23:33.483 --> 23:34.986
They're everywhere down here.

23:35.019 --> 23:37.954
I'll be surprised if you haven't
walked through a few already.

23:39.256 --> 23:41.057
Yeah, I know.

23:41.090 --> 23:42.093
I'll explain.

23:42.126 --> 23:45.462
Anyway, the real Jane
is going to the Well

23:45.496 --> 23:47.699
and we've got to stop her...

23:47.731 --> 23:51.301
...before she does
something completely stupid.

23:56.940 --> 23:59.810
Ow!

23:59.844 --> 24:01.444
What are you waiting for?

24:01.479 --> 24:02.679
Come on.

24:26.202 --> 24:27.471
Hey.

24:28.638 --> 24:30.441
Oh.

24:32.175 --> 24:34.726
Yeah.

24:39.282 --> 24:42.019
I get you, dog.

24:42.051 --> 24:43.551
I get you.

24:52.963 --> 24:55.098
This is getting old, Jane.

24:57.602 --> 24:59.604
Is it?

24:59.636 --> 25:01.271
'Cause I kinda like it.

25:02.338 --> 25:04.608
All right, let's go.

25:04.642 --> 25:05.991
Let's go.

25:22.794 --> 25:27.597
<i>Sweet, sweet baby.</i>

25:27.632 --> 25:29.733
<i>Come to me.</i>

25:31.201 --> 25:32.812
The fastest way to get
around in the Underground

25:32.836 --> 25:34.806
is through memories
like this one.

25:34.838 --> 25:35.973
They're everywhere.

25:36.007 --> 25:38.375
Deeper you go, darker they get.

25:38.410 --> 25:42.378
Sometimes the darker memories
are stuck to the nicer ones.

25:42.413 --> 25:43.948
You never know.

25:43.981 --> 25:46.517
The mind is a crazy thing.

25:46.549 --> 25:47.951
To review, class,

25:47.986 --> 25:52.056
the primary cause of the Civil
War was Abraham Lincoln.

25:52.089 --> 25:54.392
Faced with such
a godless leader,

25:54.425 --> 25:58.663
the poor southern farmers
were forced to band together

25:58.695 --> 26:01.265
to keep their farms
from nationalization.

26:01.298 --> 26:02.398
Okay.

26:02.432 --> 26:06.333
That does not sound right.

26:11.174 --> 26:13.277
Is that Jane?

26:13.309 --> 26:14.778
Not exactly.

26:14.811 --> 26:17.682
Kay Challis.

26:17.714 --> 26:19.517
Care to join
the rest of the class?

26:22.486 --> 26:24.387
I'm not Kay.

26:24.421 --> 26:26.490
My name is Miranda.

26:26.523 --> 26:27.858
Who's Miranda?

26:27.892 --> 26:29.559
She was a primary.

26:29.593 --> 26:32.130
Like Jane.

26:32.163 --> 26:35.866
Now, Kay, we've been
over this time and again.

26:35.900 --> 26:40.336
My name is Miranda.

26:40.371 --> 26:43.240
Shut the door. Shut the door.

26:43.273 --> 26:46.044
Shut the door.

26:46.076 --> 26:48.378
I need you to close your eyes.

26:48.412 --> 26:49.681
Why?

26:49.714 --> 26:53.584
Because behind this door is
what's left of Miranda's station.

26:53.617 --> 26:54.852
Where she used to live.

26:54.885 --> 26:56.854
Shut the door. Shut the door.

26:56.855 --> 26:58.154
Is that supposed to mean
something to me

26:58.155 --> 26:59.957
because I didn't even know
that there was a Miranda

26:59.958 --> 27:02.393
until five seconds ago.

27:02.425 --> 27:05.061
Trust me.

27:06.396 --> 27:08.132
Shut the door. Shut the door.

27:08.164 --> 27:10.300
Shut the door.

27:10.334 --> 27:11.335
Shit.

27:11.367 --> 27:13.468
Shut the door!

27:19.143 --> 27:20.310
Ugh.

27:20.344 --> 27:22.546
Told you not to look.

27:22.579 --> 27:23.881
What happened to Miranda?

27:23.914 --> 27:25.615
She threw herself in the Well.

27:25.650 --> 27:26.884
What's the Well?

27:26.917 --> 27:28.286
"What's the Well?"

27:28.319 --> 27:31.654
Only the last place in the
Underground Jane should go.

27:31.655 --> 27:36.605
Which is why
we have to stop her.

27:37.461 --> 27:40.164
If the Well is so dangerous,
why does Jane wanna go there?

27:40.198 --> 27:42.032
Because The Sisters sent her.

27:42.066 --> 27:43.233
It's where they send everyone

27:43.268 --> 27:48.268
bloody fool enough
to go looking for answers.

27:56.646 --> 27:58.715
It's why I don't
look for answers.

27:58.749 --> 28:00.416
Jane.

28:00.451 --> 28:01.818
Cliff.

28:01.853 --> 28:03.788
The Robotman.

28:03.820 --> 28:05.655
Hammerhead told me you met.

28:05.690 --> 28:07.423
She tell you
she grabbed my junk?

28:09.027 --> 28:10.595
Hammerhead doesn't
kiss and tell.

28:10.628 --> 28:13.498
I don't get it. Why is this
memory buried so deep?

28:13.531 --> 28:15.632
This is good.

28:15.633 --> 28:17.167
For you maybe.

28:17.201 --> 28:22.201
For us, it was the beginning
of everything going sideways.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.742
I don't understand.

28:25.776 --> 28:28.476
You gave her hope.

28:39.023 --> 28:42.326
<i>You're going to find
people who will see you and accept you,</i>

28:42.359 --> 28:45.496
<i>people who will love you
just as you are.</i>

28:45.528 --> 28:47.231
<i>What if I can't?</i>

28:47.265 --> 28:50.534
Then I'll be a father to you
just the same.

28:50.567 --> 28:52.169
You don't wanna be my father.

28:52.201 --> 28:56.840
Why not?

28:56.874 --> 29:00.577
You're nothing like my father.

29:00.611 --> 29:03.614
What was he like?

29:09.819 --> 29:11.122
No.

29:11.154 --> 29:13.723
Don't shut the door on all
the good work we've done...

29:13.758 --> 29:16.126
Fuck your door!

29:16.160 --> 29:17.461
<i>I'm trying
to help you.</i>

29:20.597 --> 29:21.664
Jane.

29:21.699 --> 29:23.567
Jesus Christ, Cliff, really?

29:23.601 --> 29:25.436
Jane, I'm sorry.

29:25.470 --> 29:27.872
I told you to fuck off,
Penny, remember?

29:27.904 --> 29:30.740
Hey, Jane.

29:30.775 --> 29:33.611
- Wait. Wait.
- Stop touching me.

29:33.644 --> 29:36.114
Stop.

29:36.146 --> 29:37.580
I didn't ask you to be here.

29:37.615 --> 29:39.016
Just hear me out.

29:39.049 --> 29:41.286
All of this is my fault.

29:41.318 --> 29:43.555
I never should've
pushed therapy on you.

29:43.587 --> 29:46.156
Rita said that it probably
wasn't even my idea.

29:46.157 --> 29:47.589
There was a rat
in my nutrient tank.

29:47.590 --> 29:49.326
Cliff.

29:49.359 --> 29:54.359
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
come back, you're scaring us.

29:56.599 --> 30:00.471
Thank you.

30:00.505 --> 30:04.709
I've been waiting for you
to say that.

30:04.741 --> 30:06.743
I really, really needed that.

30:06.777 --> 30:08.246
- Really?
- Fuck, no!

30:08.278 --> 30:11.883
Get out of my head, asshole.

30:11.915 --> 30:13.715
You need me.

30:21.558 --> 30:23.794
Fuck you.

30:23.827 --> 30:28.232
I mean that.
Fuck you.

30:28.233 --> 30:29.233
Seriously?

30:29.234 --> 30:30.968
Is this you being serious?
So this is it?

30:31.001 --> 30:33.070
You're just gonna
chuck everything away?

30:33.104 --> 30:34.939
I'm trying to help you.

30:34.971 --> 30:39.676
<i>Sweet, sweet baby Kay.</i>

30:39.710 --> 30:40.978
Jane.

30:41.011 --> 30:44.147
<i>Please don't keep me waiting.</i>

30:44.182 --> 30:46.416
Hey.

30:46.450 --> 30:48.252
Where did you go?

30:48.286 --> 30:51.189
You don't belong here, Cliff.

30:51.221 --> 30:53.857
I know about the Well.

30:53.891 --> 30:56.059
I know about Miranda.

30:56.094 --> 30:58.996
These aren't your secrets
to share.

30:59.029 --> 31:01.499
They belong to the Underground.

31:01.532 --> 31:05.836
I can bloody well share
what I want.

31:05.869 --> 31:07.939
Please.

31:07.971 --> 31:10.340
If you're really
my friend, leave.

31:10.375 --> 31:13.144
You're on a table
in the Chief's lab.

31:13.176 --> 31:16.614
All of us are worried sick
about you.

31:16.646 --> 31:17.681
Come back.

31:17.714 --> 31:19.049
- I can't.
- Why?

31:19.083 --> 31:23.386
Because I don't see the point
in going back.

31:25.689 --> 31:30.127
I know you wanna be the hero.

31:30.161 --> 31:32.663
But you're in my head
where you don't belong,

31:32.695 --> 31:36.567
and I am begging you.

31:36.599 --> 31:37.734
You wanna help me?

31:37.736 --> 31:39.569
Yes.

31:39.603 --> 31:40.803
Go home.

31:53.851 --> 31:58.122
Oh...

32:12.569 --> 32:17.569
<i>Sweet,
sweet, sweet, sweet baby.</i>

32:18.308 --> 32:22.808
<i>Sweet, sweet baby Kay.</i>

32:38.061 --> 32:40.096
Who comes
this way?

32:41.632 --> 32:42.699
Jane.

32:42.700 --> 32:43.701
Jane?

32:43.733 --> 32:46.537
I know of no Jane.

32:46.569 --> 32:49.839
Come closer.

33:06.324 --> 33:08.392
The Sisters sent me.

33:08.424 --> 33:10.693
Yes.

33:10.728 --> 33:12.528
The Sisters.

33:22.740 --> 33:26.109
The Sisters.

33:26.144 --> 33:30.713
Goodbye, Jane.

33:30.748 --> 33:33.984
You may pass.

33:36.654 --> 33:40.325
<i>Sweet,
sweet, sweet, sweet baby.</i>

33:40.357 --> 33:43.493
<i>Please don't keep me waiting.</i>

33:50.268 --> 33:52.470
I don't understand you, Cliff.

33:52.503 --> 33:56.273
Why let her go if you were
just gonna follow her anyway?

33:56.307 --> 33:58.542
What was I supposed to do?
Pick her up and carry her?

33:58.576 --> 34:00.411
I tried that, didn't go well.

34:00.444 --> 34:01.945
So I'm giving her space.

34:01.979 --> 34:05.414
Isn't that what you all want?

34:05.449 --> 34:07.151
What?

34:07.184 --> 34:10.554
This is as far as I go.

34:10.588 --> 34:13.257
I don't go looking
for the darkness.

34:13.291 --> 34:16.293
That is not my job.

34:16.327 --> 34:21.327
<i>And there's nothing
but darkness ahead.</i>

35:21.659 --> 35:25.862
<i>Who's memory is this?</i>

35:25.896 --> 35:30.668
Oh.

35:30.702 --> 35:35.652
This is where
it began, isn't it?

35:36.775 --> 35:41.775
Kay, I don't know
who you need me to be.

35:45.550 --> 35:50.550
I don't know if I'm
supposed to feel happy.

35:58.161 --> 36:02.198
And you...

36:02.199 --> 36:04.483
You're perfect.

36:09.039 --> 36:10.240
I know you're a memory,

36:10.242 --> 36:13.411
but I don't know
where to turn.

36:13.443 --> 36:18.094
Or who I can trust
or if I can.

36:24.887 --> 36:26.925
I'm trying,

36:26.958 --> 36:31.958
but I don't
know if I want to try anymore.

36:37.568 --> 36:40.070
Sweet, sweet baby Kay.

36:40.103 --> 36:42.306
There you are.

36:42.340 --> 36:45.777
Come.

36:45.809 --> 36:48.545
I haven't finished
my puzzle yet.

36:48.579 --> 36:50.213
Finish it later.

36:50.248 --> 36:52.349
Come, my sweet baby,

36:52.382 --> 36:55.682
before Mother returns.

37:04.961 --> 37:07.961
That's my good girl.

37:13.903 --> 37:17.375
Bye-bye.

37:17.407 --> 37:21.608
I smell a man.

37:22.980 --> 37:25.380
No man can pass.

37:35.192 --> 37:38.262
Hello?

37:38.295 --> 37:40.764
What's your name?
I'm here for Jane.

37:40.797 --> 37:43.400
Ahhh! Oh!

37:43.434 --> 37:45.369
Damn it.

37:45.402 --> 37:47.137
No man can pass.

37:47.170 --> 37:49.574
No!

37:49.606 --> 37:50.974
I'm here for Jane.

37:51.007 --> 37:55.278
No man can pass.

38:01.418 --> 38:03.253
I'm not a man.

38:03.286 --> 38:05.456
Hi, Daddy.

38:05.489 --> 38:06.925
I'm not a man.

38:06.958 --> 38:09.427
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>

38:09.460 --> 38:11.963
<i>I'm gonna be better.</i>

38:11.996 --> 38:15.398
<i>Oh, God. What did I do?
I'm a monster.</i>

38:15.432 --> 38:18.068
<i>Cliff,
you're a fucking monster.</i>

38:18.101 --> 38:20.036
<i>Are you a ghost?</i>

38:20.070 --> 38:24.342
I'm not a fucking man.

38:24.375 --> 38:26.210
<i>All I want to do is cry.</i>

38:26.242 --> 38:28.945
My brain is free from release.

38:28.978 --> 38:30.547
<i>I'm so angry.</i>

38:30.581 --> 38:32.248
<i>You're not my family.</i>

38:33.384 --> 38:36.085
<i>I'm a robot.
I'm a brain.</i>

38:36.119 --> 38:40.458
<i>It's not my fucking life!</i>

38:46.496 --> 38:48.733
I'm not a man.

38:48.766 --> 38:53.766
I used to be.
I was a different person then.

38:53.871 --> 38:55.039
A lesser person.

39:12.956 --> 39:17.217
You are no man.

39:18.528 --> 39:23.099
This no man

39:23.132 --> 39:24.483
can pass.

39:42.385 --> 39:46.724
No one to tell.
Nowhere to turn.

39:46.757 --> 39:49.893
No one tells.
Tell no one.

39:49.927 --> 39:51.061
Jane?

39:51.094 --> 39:52.463
<i>Sweet baby.</i>

39:52.496 --> 39:53.963
No one tells.

39:53.996 --> 39:55.166
<i>Sweet...</i>

39:55.199 --> 39:56.433
Tell no one...

39:56.434 --> 39:58.134
<i>Sweet, sweet baby.</i>

39:58.135 --> 39:59.369
No one...

39:59.402 --> 40:02.373
<i>Come to me.</i>

40:02.405 --> 40:04.608
<i>Tell no one.</i>

40:04.641 --> 40:06.643
Nowhere to turn.

40:06.677 --> 40:09.280
No one to tell.

40:09.313 --> 40:11.548
Nowhere to turn.

40:11.581 --> 40:15.251
No one tells.

40:15.286 --> 40:19.856
No one... No one tells.

40:19.889 --> 40:21.992
No one.

40:22.025 --> 40:24.394
- No one.
- Jane?

40:24.427 --> 40:26.396
Come on, let's go home.

40:29.400 --> 40:34.237
Jane!

40:34.271 --> 40:37.041
Whoa!

40:37.074 --> 40:40.510
<i>Sweet, sweet baby.</i>

40:40.545 --> 40:42.445
<i>Come join me.</i>

40:42.480 --> 40:45.349
Jane, what the hell is that?

40:45.382 --> 40:46.951
<i>She's mine.</i>

40:46.985 --> 40:51.021
You can't fight Daddy.
Nobody can.

40:51.054 --> 40:53.958
He's too strong.

40:53.992 --> 40:57.293
Oh, shit! That's your father.

40:57.327 --> 40:58.695
<i>Sweet, sweet baby.</i>

40:58.730 --> 41:01.297
Listen. Listen to me.
That's not him.

41:01.331 --> 41:02.766
This is you.

41:02.800 --> 41:03.967
That's not your father.

41:04.001 --> 41:05.836
This isn't even real.
It's all in your head.

41:05.869 --> 41:07.338
- <i>No!
- Fuck you!</i>

41:07.371 --> 41:10.574
Jane, wake up! Jane, wake...

41:15.112 --> 41:16.447
Jane, run.

41:16.480 --> 41:18.583
Oh, no!

41:18.615 --> 41:22.052
Whoa!

41:23.855 --> 41:28.355
Jane, save yourself. Just run!

41:31.128 --> 41:33.329
No, stop it!

41:33.364 --> 41:35.699
Not him.

41:35.733 --> 41:39.603
Stop it! Stop it!

41:39.637 --> 41:42.539
You destroy everything!

41:42.572 --> 41:46.110
I will not let you
destroy him!

41:46.143 --> 41:48.045
I hate you!

41:48.079 --> 41:51.882
I hate you,
you filthy disgusting man!

41:51.916 --> 41:55.786
I am not afraid of you!

41:55.820 --> 41:59.056
I am not afraid of you!

41:59.088 --> 42:01.358
I am not afraid!

42:04.260 --> 42:05.396
<i>Sweet, sweet...</i>

42:05.429 --> 42:07.378
No!

43:13.530 --> 43:17.268
Welcome back, Jane.

43:17.300 --> 43:21.539
Give her some room.

43:21.572 --> 43:24.641
What the hell happened here?

43:24.675 --> 43:27.375
Long story.

43:30.648 --> 43:34.786
What happened in there?

43:34.818 --> 43:39.556
That's not my story to tell.

43:39.590 --> 43:41.960
<i>The good thing is she's back.</i>

43:41.992 --> 43:46.943
<i>And I think she's better.</i>

43:59.043 --> 44:01.344
<i>Sweet, sweet baby.</i>
