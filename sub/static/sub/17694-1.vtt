WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:04.003
ANNOUNCER:
Feeling a little tired

00:04.005 --> 00:06.138
of America's number-one sport,
football?

00:06.140 --> 00:07.706
God, they're pathetic!

00:07.708 --> 00:09.775
There's got to be a better way.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.378
And there already is.

00:12.380 --> 00:15.047
Arena football!

00:15.049 --> 00:17.182
Unforgiving sideline barriers!

00:17.184 --> 00:18.484
(bones crack,
cheers and applause)

00:18.486 --> 00:21.020
Water cannons!

00:21.022 --> 00:22.321
(bones crack)
(screams)

00:22.323 --> 00:25.624
And you better
watch out for...

00:25.626 --> 00:28.060
the Black Knight!

00:28.062 --> 00:30.129
It's arena football.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.997
And the indoor thrills
are coming your way

00:31.999 --> 00:34.566
as the league welcomes
its newest expansion team --

00:34.568 --> 00:38.003
the Langley Falls
Bazooka Sharks!

00:38.005 --> 00:40.539
Finally! Yeah!

00:40.541 --> 00:42.741
Yeah! Ah! Yeah!

00:42.743 --> 00:44.043
Yeah!

00:44.045 --> 00:45.744
Yeah! Yeah!

00:45.746 --> 00:47.179
Yeah!

00:47.181 --> 00:48.414
Yeah!

00:48.416 --> 00:51.283
(all shouting)

00:53.754 --> 00:57.156
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

00:57.158 --> 01:00.492
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

01:00.494 --> 01:03.595
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

01:03.597 --> 01:07.833
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

01:09.703 --> 01:13.005
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

01:13.007 --> 01:15.240
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:15.242 --> 01:16.642
Aah!

01:18.079 --> 01:21.313
<i> ¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶</i>

01:25.453 --> 01:28.854
Old Man Hansen, do you sell
Bazooka Sharks merchandise?

01:28.856 --> 01:31.623
I'm looking for one of those
Snuggies with a built-in diaper

01:31.625 --> 01:33.258
and a place I can put
my driver's license.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.794
That blasted
arena football team!

01:35.796 --> 01:38.397
We've been here
three generations,

01:38.399 --> 01:41.533
and now they're tearing us down
to put in the new stadium.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.236
You poor old man.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.705
This lamp sucks.
I'll give you 2 bucks for it.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.774
Mom!
That is disgusting.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.110
Taking advantage of -- Wait.
Half off this bird cage?

01:51.112 --> 01:53.378
Please,
I could really use this.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.647
I foster abused birds.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.883
I'd like to
put a candle in it.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.219
I still have one shot
to save the store.

02:00.221 --> 02:03.388
There's a town council meeting
about the stadium tonight.

02:03.390 --> 02:06.158
Tonight, eh?
Oh, I'll be there.

02:06.160 --> 02:09.328
Please don't come if you're
gonna support the stadium.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.964
It's too late.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.836
What's to become of you with
the store closing, Petruchio?

02:17.838 --> 02:20.839
It could-a be time to find
the guy who killed my brother.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.774
Mm, now,
what is this lining?

02:22.776 --> 02:25.410
Is a fine Bemberg lining,
Mr. Steve.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.646
Bemberg, not silk.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.482
Well, you've been right about
this kind of thing before.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.851
Snot went nuts for me
in paisley.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.320
Inseam always-a 20 inches.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.322
I-Is that unusual?

02:37.324 --> 02:40.459
You see, all the other boys --
bum, bum, bum,

02:40.461 --> 02:41.927
they are growing.

02:41.929 --> 02:45.764
You -- bum, bum, bum.
You hear the difference?

02:45.766 --> 02:48.300
They go on
to men's-a department.

02:48.302 --> 02:51.203
But you stay
with Petruchio.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.972
Y-You're telling me
I'm not growing at all?

02:53.974 --> 02:55.841
Not in two years.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.944
And it says it's been-a
three days since-a you poop.

02:58.946 --> 03:01.647
Let me see that book.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.016
A-never.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.790
I am not growing!
Look!

03:11.792 --> 03:13.325
Nothing's happening!

03:13.327 --> 03:15.460
Yeah, when we flew to Hawaii
last summer,

03:15.462 --> 03:17.062
you sat on Dad's lap
for free.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.530
I haven't grown in years.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.699
And it's actually
quite liberating.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.302
Gives me time to focus
on all my other shit.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.304
B-B-But what if I
never grow again?

03:25.306 --> 03:27.573
Look, if you really
want to do something,

03:27.575 --> 03:30.842
I know a doctor who specializes
in growth treatments.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.412
A specialist --
that's where the money is.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.581
I should probably talk
to my dad about this.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.182
Steve,
you want to talk?

03:37.184 --> 03:39.418
Oh, yeah.
I wanted to ask you --
There's no time.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.919
Your mother and I
have to hurry

03:40.921 --> 03:42.354
down to the town
council meeting.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.722
I hope
they let me speak.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.757
I didn't put my name on a list
or anything.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.360
Of course they'll let you,
honey. You're tall.

03:48.362 --> 03:51.163
You're right.
I'm to be taken seriously.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.366
Oh, Steve,
that really ties into

03:54.368 --> 03:56.602
what you were talking about
earlier.

03:56.604 --> 04:00.505
BUCKLE: The sign outside
needs to be updated.

04:00.507 --> 04:02.774
And I say
we just break the glass

04:02.776 --> 04:05.711
instead of continuing
this preposterous 30-year search

04:05.713 --> 04:07.079
for the key.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.714
And I say the key
is still out there.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.015
Agreed.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.219
We'll now hear the last
of the community objections

04:14.221 --> 04:16.054
to the arena football stadium.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.956
First up is Old Man Hansen.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.524
(clears throat)

04:19.526 --> 04:21.927
Good people of Langley Falls,

04:21.929 --> 04:24.463
I ask you to join me

04:24.465 --> 04:28.467
in standing up to the no-good
crooks on our city council.

04:28.469 --> 04:31.770
These bums are lining their
pockets with their dirty deals,

04:31.772 --> 04:34.406
and they need to be hogtied
and thrown down a well!

04:34.408 --> 04:35.974
(clears throat)

04:35.976 --> 04:38.477
Sorry.
I'm a little nervous.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.145
You're doing great.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.214
It's important
for Langley Falls

04:42.216 --> 04:44.816
to protect
our historic places.

04:44.818 --> 04:49.421
Also, while I'm up here,
my name isn't Old Man Hansen.

04:49.423 --> 04:52.257
It's Olmen -- Olmen Hansen.

04:52.259 --> 04:54.559
It's Swedish. I'm 43.

04:54.561 --> 04:57.229
I think we've all heard just
about enough from Old Man H.

04:57.231 --> 04:59.298
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.166
If you don't count
our two hockey teams

05:01.168 --> 05:03.068
and our championship
basketball squad --

05:03.070 --> 05:05.737
Go, Lizards -- we have no
indoor sports in this town.

05:05.739 --> 05:09.141
We need indoor sports
for the times when it's raining!

05:10.144 --> 05:12.577
Look at this beautiful vision
of the future.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.747
It's time for us to join the
ranks of the other great cities

05:15.749 --> 05:18.150
in the Arena League
Mid-Atlantic Conference.

05:18.152 --> 05:21.520
I'm talking Wilkes-Barre,
Harrisburg, Wilmington.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.322
[Bleep] Wilmington!

05:23.324 --> 05:25.090
Great cities
have to move forward.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.192
And you know what else
has to move forward?

05:27.194 --> 05:28.927
Uh, parades?

05:28.929 --> 05:31.963
Sharks.
Bazooka sharks.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.533
Wow.
Parades isn't wrong.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.601
We can't go back to the past.

05:36.603 --> 05:40.038
We can't go back to
a time before arena football.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.040
No go back!

05:42.042 --> 05:43.308
ALL:
(chanting "No go back")

05:43.310 --> 05:45.010
Wait, what is this?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.445
COUNCILMAN #2: Oh, just some
tree that's gonna be cut down

05:46.447 --> 05:48.113
to make way
for the arena.

05:48.115 --> 05:52.217
I'd like to go back on
my previous statement.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.820
(all gasp)
But no go back.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.688
This stadium cannot happen.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.357
Mr. Smith,

05:58.359 --> 06:00.058
you've made a passionate case
in favor of progress,

06:00.060 --> 06:03.662
and now, before us and God
and the Langley charter,

06:03.664 --> 06:06.531
you mysteriously
reverse your position?

06:06.533 --> 06:10.902
You are, simply put, the most
electric speaker I've ever seen.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.505
I-I just think
we're, uh, rushing into things.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.173
That's what I'm saying.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.542
Can someone put Grandpa to bed?
I'm trying to talk here.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.745
We went to high school
together!

06:19.747 --> 06:22.681
Let's get real, you guys.
Do we even want this stadium?

06:22.683 --> 06:25.183
Arena football
is kind of lame.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.018
(all gasp)
Mr. Smith,

06:27.020 --> 06:28.987
what is really going on here?

06:28.989 --> 06:31.990
It obviously has something to do
with that tree.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.593
Now, come on.
You can talk to us.

06:34.595 --> 06:38.897
We're your town council.
We love you.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.366
(sighs) All right.

06:41.368 --> 06:44.770
If you must know, that tree...

06:44.772 --> 06:46.905
that tree is my father.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.508
What does that
even mean?

06:49.510 --> 06:51.676
It means he's half tree.

06:51.678 --> 06:55.781
Question is,
what's the other half?

07:01.355 --> 07:03.789
(indistinct shouting)
Order, order.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.425
Stenographer, can you read
those last parts back?

07:06.427 --> 07:09.127
And then Mr. Smith said,
"That tree is my father,"

07:09.129 --> 07:11.930
at which point, the stenographer
blacked out from excitement

07:11.932 --> 07:13.532
and the record stops.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.966
I apologize to the council.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.902
I ate some almonds.
I'm good now.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.237
Mr. Smith, I think we're ready
to hear what you mean

07:19.239 --> 07:21.072
when you say
this tree is your father.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.909
Okay.
I'll tell you.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.243
(chairs creak)

07:25.245 --> 07:26.611
I was just a little --

07:26.613 --> 07:27.879
(chairs creak)

07:27.881 --> 07:29.448
I was just --
(chair creaks)

07:29.450 --> 07:30.849
Is everyone comfortable?

07:32.319 --> 07:34.719
I was just a little kid.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.589
The father-son picnic.

07:37.591 --> 07:41.426
And, as usual, my dad, Jack, was
the only one who didn't show up.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.261
I felt so alone.

07:43.263 --> 07:46.798
But then -- then I wasn't.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.968
After that, I came back
every day after school.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.939
I know this sounds crazy,
but the tree raised me.

07:53.941 --> 07:56.641
He taught me how to play catch.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.910
He watched me grow.

08:02.316 --> 08:05.016
He helped me start
my first business,

08:05.018 --> 08:07.018
even gave me my product.

08:07.020 --> 08:11.122
Turns out magnolia juice is
as poisonous as it is delicious.

08:11.124 --> 08:14.593
And no matter what,
he kept me safe.

08:20.501 --> 08:23.835
His mighty roots connected me
to something constant,

08:23.837 --> 08:25.604
something I could depend on,

08:25.606 --> 08:28.807
when so often life is cruel
and unreliable.

08:28.809 --> 08:33.512
He has been and always will be
there for me.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.449
Please don't kill
my tree daddy.

08:37.451 --> 08:39.451
My God, Stan.

08:39.453 --> 08:42.354
How come I've never heard of
this tree father before?

08:42.356 --> 08:43.822
I've brought you there
tons of time.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.323
I made us have our wedding
there.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.993
Oh. I just thought
you were a cheap asshole.

08:47.995 --> 08:51.029
In light of new facts
and emotions,

08:51.031 --> 08:54.733
I move to cancel
the stadium construction.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.301
All in favor?

08:56.303 --> 08:58.003
ALL: Aye.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.371
All opposed?

08:59.373 --> 09:00.705
(all gasp)

09:00.707 --> 09:03.708
It's Dom Fikowski,
the asphalt king.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.243
He runs asphalt
in this town.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.745
Don't you think
I know that?

09:06.747 --> 09:09.247
Y'all know me.
Y'all know what I do.

09:09.249 --> 09:13.018
I sling the hot stuff, the flat
makings, the stone carpet.

09:13.020 --> 09:16.321
I'm sure you folks are hearing a
lot of objections to the arena.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.858
Taxes, traffic, crime --
so much crime.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.092
Crime is a problem.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.861
Think of the advantages

09:22.863 --> 09:25.163
from an asphalt-pouring
standpoint.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.065
With the new parking lots alone,

09:27.067 --> 09:30.535
we're looking at two square
miles of sizzling-hot tarmac.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.404
When the sun starts beating
on it,

09:32.406 --> 09:35.340
the average temperature around
town is gonna go up 10 degrees.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.909
With all the balmy,
roasting breezes,

09:37.911 --> 09:41.179
it's gonna feel like
we're on permanent vacation.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.847
ALL: Ooh.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.516
And if you're still
on the fence,

09:44.518 --> 09:47.285
allow me to get you off...
the fence

09:47.287 --> 09:49.688
with some free asphalt.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.222
Aw!

09:51.224 --> 09:53.825
(laughs) It burns.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.629
The stadium is back on.

09:57.631 --> 09:58.964
(gavel bangs)

10:01.368 --> 10:03.535
Roger,
you can't build the stadium.

10:03.537 --> 10:06.304
You're standing here
in a parking lot I poured,

10:06.306 --> 10:08.273
asking me
not to pour asphalt?

10:08.275 --> 10:10.442
Pouring asphalt is what I do,
Stan.

10:10.444 --> 10:13.411
If you do this, it would mean
the death of my dad tree.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.915
Ugh.
I really wanted this pour.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.951
But out of respect
for our friendship,

10:19.953 --> 10:23.888
I'll withdraw my bid, kill the
project, and save your tree.

10:26.059 --> 10:29.227
We did it, Tree Dad.
They're not gonna cut you down.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.796
And it's all thanks
to Roger.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.898
That paper boy
always finds me.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.134
PAPER BOY: It's 'cause
I'm in love with you.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.304
"Stadium off...

10:39.306 --> 10:40.905
to the races."

10:40.907 --> 10:42.173
What?

10:42.175 --> 10:44.242
"Carconi Brothers
pick up construction bid

10:44.244 --> 10:46.244
after Fikowski drops out."

10:46.246 --> 10:48.480
Carconi Brothers.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.317
I knew it would be you.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.919
You have to cancel this project.
You promised.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.955
But I don't control anything
around here.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.690
I'm just
dumb old Frankie.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.159
My twin brother, Freddie's,
the boss, and what he says goes.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.795
I screw up a lot.
Stupid Frankie.

11:03.797 --> 11:07.298
So, your twin brother
is who I have to talk to?

11:07.300 --> 11:09.367
So tedious.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.369
FREDDIE:
Damn it, Frankie!

11:11.371 --> 11:14.105
You just let some nut come in
and open my plywood door?

11:14.107 --> 11:15.640
He was so fast, Freddie.

11:15.642 --> 11:18.009
You have a human brother?

11:18.011 --> 11:20.612
Oh, yeah.
And Mama just loves Freddie.

11:20.614 --> 11:22.347
She lets him have sex
with girls

11:22.349 --> 11:25.283
but puts my ear to the stove
for playing with the chickens.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.686
How's that figure,
you stupid mama?

11:27.688 --> 11:29.521
(gasps)
I'm sorry, Mama.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.022
(smooching)

11:33.226 --> 11:35.527
I-I-I can't get into this
right now.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.896
You can't tear down
my tree father.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.664
I can't stop it.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.133
I'm drowning
in bulldozer invoices.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.002
I'm supposed to
keep the yellow copy,

11:44.004 --> 11:45.470
but the purple one's prettier.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.742
What can I do for you today,
little buddy?

11:50.744 --> 11:53.411
You want to do something
about that skin?

11:53.413 --> 11:56.881
I'm here because it's come to my
attention that I am not growing.

11:56.883 --> 12:00.185
(laughs) You want to know
the secret to growing?

12:00.187 --> 12:02.420
Get lots of sleep,
eat lots of veggies,

12:02.422 --> 12:04.556
and always remember
your inner worth,

12:04.558 --> 12:07.192
'cause that'll make you feel
10 feet tall.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.526
Oh.

12:08.528 --> 12:09.928
Klaus made it sound like

12:09.930 --> 12:11.930
you might have more
immediate solutions.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.331
You know Klaus?

12:13.333 --> 12:18.503
(German accent)
That changes everything.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.506
Much can be done
about your height.

12:21.508 --> 12:26.578
Are you familiar with
the abominable sciences?

12:28.181 --> 12:31.182
There's bone splicing,
giraffe marrow transplant.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.385
I could boil your brain
in gorilla hormones.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.588
I also have
unorthodox options.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.190
For instance,
I could have your soul

12:39.192 --> 12:41.793
put into the body
of something taller.

12:41.795 --> 12:45.897
How comfortable are you
with the serpent god Oxumaré?

12:45.899 --> 12:47.632
Not super comfortable.

12:47.634 --> 12:50.101
We'll stick to surgery,
then!

12:50.103 --> 12:52.303
I'd like to think on it.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.606
What's there
to think about?

12:54.608 --> 12:58.643
If B.B. King had come to me,
he would have never died...

12:58.645 --> 13:00.812
at the height he was.

13:00.814 --> 13:03.081
The Carconi Brothers are
coming to tear you down.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.716
They're coming,

13:04.718 --> 13:07.385
and -- and I don't have any
ideas about how to stop them.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.321
(engines rumble)

13:11.825 --> 13:14.292
Get out of the way,
you tree-hugging fruit.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.061
So,
you think I'm a fruit, huh?

13:17.063 --> 13:20.665
Well, then a fruit
I shall become.

13:20.667 --> 13:23.301
Oh, my God, Freddie,
we can't chop down a tree

13:23.303 --> 13:25.069
with a homosexual man
in it.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.604
Ugh, no.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.474
I made a gay slur,
then he threw it back in my face

13:29.476 --> 13:32.143
by acting like the kind of fruit
that grows on trees.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.979
Everybody thinks so fast.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.085
Stan Smith, remove yourself
from the tree immediately.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.454
Not until you promise
you won't cut it down.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.323
That's a great idea.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.226
I'll go and get on the roof
of my store right --

13:51.665 --> 13:53.464
I'm so sorry.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.100
Can I offer you
a temporary tattoo?

13:56.102 --> 13:57.702
I'll get him down,
Freddie.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.604
I know just how
to play this guy.

13:59.606 --> 14:00.872
Please get down.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.341
Freddie says
the budget's so tight

14:03.343 --> 14:05.510
that if you delay us
just seven days,

14:05.512 --> 14:08.646
the whole thing'll be canceled,
saving your stupid tree.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.348
Seven days?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.851
I can do that
for my tree dad.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.686
(gasps)
Dumb Frankie.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.154
Dumb. Dumb.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.555
W-What are you, uh --

14:17.557 --> 14:19.691
W-What do you get
out of this Frankie thing?

14:19.693 --> 14:22.360
Actually, I get some great intel
for Fikowski Asphalt.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.562
It's me, Dom Fikowski.

14:24.564 --> 14:27.198
You'll never make it
a week.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.901
¶¶

14:36.810 --> 14:39.377
(wind whistles)

14:50.023 --> 14:52.323
(all shouting)

15:20.353 --> 15:22.787
(wind whistles)

15:31.965 --> 15:34.699
(wind whistles)

15:34.701 --> 15:37.201
(thunder cracks)

15:48.915 --> 15:51.983
Dr. Kalgary, I've decided I --
Oh, you're with a patient.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.419
It's just Billy.
He's part of the program.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.321
One of my success stories.

15:56.323 --> 15:59.057
I used to be
six inches tall.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.459
Now
I'm Daddy's favorite.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.761
Look at me walk.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.164
Oh, my God.

16:06.166 --> 16:09.968
W-Well, despite...this,
I still want the operation.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.469
I need to grow.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.071
Wonderful!

16:13.073 --> 16:15.840
You'll be able to look over
any stall in the men's room

16:15.842 --> 16:17.675
and see what's happening.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.311
Hooray.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.984
It's coming to the end of day 7
in --

16:25.986 --> 16:27.785
Oop, that weird Carconi brother

16:27.787 --> 16:30.254
who's always telling everyone
he's an honorary firefighter

16:30.256 --> 16:31.622
is approaching the tree now.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.825
Well, Freddie says
once the sun sets,

16:33.827 --> 16:35.660
we got to send
the crew home.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.328
That means
the stadium's dead

16:37.330 --> 16:39.964
and he's not gonna take me
to Mountain Mike's Pizza.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.834
(voice breaking)
And it's the sauciest pizza.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.837
Oh,
my sweet flesh family.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.439
Come, be with me
in my hour of triumph.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.141
Honey,
you've blown me away

16:50.143 --> 16:52.610
with your commitment
to this hunger strike.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.479
It wasn't supposed to be
a hunger strike.

16:54.481 --> 16:55.980
I kept asking you
to bring me food.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.782
But I stood strong.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.952
Hayley, who would have thought
that between the two of us,

17:00.954 --> 17:03.054
I'd be the first one
to save a tree?

17:03.056 --> 17:04.489
I've saved lots of trees.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.457
I'm sorry.
You're right, sweetie.

17:06.459 --> 17:09.827
Not ever buying or reading books
is also a way of saving trees.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.195
Where's Steve?

17:11.197 --> 17:12.830
Yeah, where is Steve?

17:12.832 --> 17:14.298
Oh, you guys don't know?

17:14.300 --> 17:16.734
Steve's with my associate,
Dr. Kalgary,

17:16.736 --> 17:18.903
about to undergo
an irreversible,

17:18.905 --> 17:21.672
fabulously risky,
height-boosting procedure.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.041
What?
What?

17:23.043 --> 17:24.675
Steve will be sliced
into pieces,

17:24.677 --> 17:26.177
and when he's reassembled,

17:26.179 --> 17:28.179
he'll be exactly like the boy
you remember,

17:28.181 --> 17:31.849
only taller
and with a lot more bones...

17:31.851 --> 17:33.151
if he lives.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.519
Oh, God.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.821
Why would Steve do something
like this?

17:36.823 --> 17:39.023
Wait, does he think
he stopped growing?

17:39.025 --> 17:41.426
Yeah, that's right.
I know
what this is about.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.728
You do?
Yep.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.830
Well?

17:45.832 --> 17:49.000
It's sounds like he could
use some guidance, Stan.

17:49.002 --> 17:51.169
I agree.
But for whatever reason,

17:51.171 --> 17:53.371
he never developed
a relationship with a tree.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.705
Poor kid.

17:54.707 --> 17:57.909
I think
<i> you</i> can be his tree.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.545
A human tree father.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.180
It sounds so stupid.

18:02.182 --> 18:05.917
But to hell with how it sounds.
Steve needs me.

18:08.688 --> 18:12.090
But if I leave to save him,
they're gonna cut you down.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.125
(wind whistles)

18:16.296 --> 18:19.931
You're right.
Steve's my responsibility now.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.033
You're still teaching me.

18:22.035 --> 18:25.303
I guess...this is goodbye.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.040
I love you, Tree Daddy.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.944
He's gone!

18:32.946 --> 18:35.246
(singsong voice)
Frankie gets the pizza.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.781
(sobs)

18:38.451 --> 18:40.151
¶ The surgeon
cuts at night ¶

18:40.153 --> 18:42.820
¶ The surgeon
cuts at night ¶

18:42.822 --> 18:44.889
¶ I'm gonna cut you,
Steve ¶

18:44.891 --> 18:47.892
¶ I'm gonna cut you right ¶

18:47.894 --> 18:50.761
Actually, uh, you know,
I think I've changed my mi--

18:50.763 --> 18:52.463
Oh.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.099
They always get cold feet.

18:55.101 --> 18:58.636
And I always
cut them off.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.241
Aah!

19:12.118 --> 19:15.286
STEVE: Oh, my God.
I'm so tall.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.088
It's gonna take
some getting used to.

19:17.090 --> 19:19.123
Aaaaah!

19:19.125 --> 19:21.359
Aaaaaah!

19:21.361 --> 19:23.961
Look out, Steve.
I made things worse for you.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.930
Hold on, son.
I can climb up.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.366
(voice breaking)
Someone taught me how.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.700
Dad, get it together!

19:29.702 --> 19:31.569
Coming.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.773
(saw whirring)

19:35.775 --> 19:37.108
(metal creaking)

19:37.110 --> 19:40.611
Aaaah!

19:41.948 --> 19:43.548
You're here.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.049
Of course I am.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.884
It's what dads do.

19:46.886 --> 19:50.288
Even when their kid's
a stupid shorty?

19:50.290 --> 19:53.024
Steve, there's something
I have to show you.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.725
(siren wailing)

19:54.727 --> 19:56.127
(gasps) The fuzz!

19:56.129 --> 19:59.697
Time to see if your wings work,
Billy!

20:03.703 --> 20:05.736
Run, Billy!

20:09.542 --> 20:11.042
When I was a boy,

20:11.044 --> 20:13.177
I used to carve my height
here on the bark.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.479
This extra-deep one
is from a few years

20:15.481 --> 20:17.014
where I didn't grow at all.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.050
It's called
the Smith Stall.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.652
But eventually,
I shot up six inches.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.054
So I will get tall.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.856
But even if I didn't,
it doesn't matter

20:25.858 --> 20:28.759
because I have a dad
who loves me.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.862
You're gonna get tall.

20:31.864 --> 20:37.168
So, this tree w-was like a dad
to you or something?

20:37.170 --> 20:39.270
I know.
We'll both miss him.

20:39.272 --> 20:42.073
But he goes on now
to a greater purpose.

20:42.075 --> 20:45.476
May his timber bring shelter
to a deserving soul.

20:53.253 --> 20:56.921
Please don't cut down this tree.
It's like a father to me.

20:56.923 --> 21:02.226
The world...needs
...ax handles.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.195
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
