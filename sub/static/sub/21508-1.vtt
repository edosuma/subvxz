01:41.267 --> 01:42.401
Ah!

01:58.284 --> 01:59.384
Joe?

02:03.156 --> 02:04.323
Joe?

02:09.562 --> 02:12.197
Oh! Oh my God.

02:12.199 --> 02:13.532
Oh no!

02:33.486 --> 02:36.522
911. What is your emergency?

02:37.458 --> 02:40.492
Emergency, what is your problem?

02:40.494 --> 02:41.527
Hello?

02:42.629 --> 02:43.729
Hello!

03:52.265 --> 03:53.865
Good morning, professor.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.634
Good morning, Joe.

04:14.621 --> 04:17.522
Would the tranferees
from Professor McDeere's class

04:17.524 --> 04:18.890
please give me
a show of hands.

04:20.326 --> 04:21.526
Welcome.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.395
I know it's rather
late in the term

04:23.397 --> 04:24.630
but the syllabus
is the same

04:24.632 --> 04:26.999
so it should be a
pretty smooth transition.

04:27.001 --> 04:29.268
Especially since
we're on our last topic,

04:29.270 --> 04:30.869
which is...

04:32.605 --> 04:35.774
ethics and law.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.011
Two words not often spoken
in the same breath.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.913
Ignore it at your
own peril,

04:41.915 --> 04:43.582
ladies and gentlemen.

04:43.584 --> 04:46.051
You could risk ending your
career before it's even begun.

04:46.986 --> 04:48.420
So remember,

04:48.422 --> 04:49.788
only fools...

04:49.790 --> 04:52.424
- Break the rules.
- That's right.

04:52.426 --> 04:55.394
Yes! Alright, I would like
to start today's class

04:55.396 --> 04:57.562
with a quote from
Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin.

04:57.564 --> 05:01.433
Some of you may know him
from the silent movie era.

05:01.435 --> 05:05.304
"Man is animal, with primary
instincts of survival.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.973
"Consequently, his ingenuity
has developed first,

05:07.975 --> 05:09.508
"and his soul afterwards.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.776
"Thus, the progress of science

05:10.778 --> 05:13.545
is far ahead of Man's
ethical behavior."

05:14.480 --> 05:15.981
What do you think he means?

05:17.717 --> 05:19.051
Yes, Mr. Vaughn?

05:19.053 --> 05:20.852
I think he's saying that,

05:20.854 --> 05:23.588
while primary instincts
are inborn,

05:23.590 --> 05:25.457
ethical behavior
has to be learned.

05:25.459 --> 05:28.527
Exactly!
Ethical behavior.

05:28.529 --> 05:31.663
So, who of you bright,
young, would-be lawyers

05:31.665 --> 05:32.964
can tell me what we mean

05:32.966 --> 05:35.467
by "ethics"?

05:35.469 --> 05:38.036
- Miss Hart?
- Well, ethics is like

05:38.038 --> 05:41.406
a system of moral
standards or values.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.008
Yes. Thank you.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.944
Would anyone like
to elaborate?

05:47.747 --> 05:50.816
Oh, come on.
At least Miss Hart
consulted Websters.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.553
No one else did their
homework last night?

05:56.889 --> 05:58.457
Yes, Mr.?

05:58.459 --> 06:00.892
Van Sickle, Vance.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.695
Ethics are a set of rules
codified by an

06:03.697 --> 06:05.797
established society.
Do's and dont's

06:05.799 --> 06:08.734
that dictate and govern
acceptable social behavior.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.836
Well said.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.938
That doesn't make
them right.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.974
Like morality,
they're just a set of

06:15.976 --> 06:19.845
arbitrary rules imposed
on us by society.

06:19.847 --> 06:24.416
You are quite the cynic
Mr. Van Sickle.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.051
Moving forward,
just so those of you

06:26.053 --> 06:28.820
who just transferred in
are clear, in my class

06:28.822 --> 06:31.390
we follow the rules.

06:31.392 --> 06:32.991
Moving on...

06:32.993 --> 06:34.793
Who can give me

06:34.795 --> 06:37.028
an early example of
a code of conduct?

06:38.898 --> 06:40.132
Anyone?

06:42.769 --> 06:44.136
How about you,
Mr. Van Sickle?

06:45.405 --> 06:48.507
Mr. Van Sickle?

06:48.509 --> 06:51.643
Mr. Van Sickle, I was
asking if anyone could
give me an example--

06:51.645 --> 06:53.612
You can find the code of conduct
pertaining to law

06:53.614 --> 06:56.715
in the A.B.A.'s Rules of
Professional Conduct, 1983.

06:58.050 --> 07:00.185
And you thought
I wasn't listening.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.529
A.B.A.'s

07:10.531 --> 07:13.765
Rules of Conduct.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.967
1983.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.569
This particular code

07:17.571 --> 07:22.207
helps us to negotiate
the ethical minefields

07:22.209 --> 07:23.675
of a courtroom.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.877
Pay particular
attention to...

07:27.480 --> 07:30.482
Rule 3:
The responsibilities

07:30.484 --> 07:32.651
of an attorney
to the tribunal.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.654
Read my lips, people.
This is crucial!

07:35.656 --> 07:38.957
This rule plays an integral
part in your mock trials,

07:38.959 --> 07:40.625
which...

07:40.627 --> 07:45.697
are your final exam,
and 60% of your final grade.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.999
Okay, time is up for today.

07:49.569 --> 07:51.136
Don't forget
to check the board

07:51.138 --> 07:53.004
for your presentation times.

08:00.112 --> 08:01.880
Mr. Van Sickle?

08:02.949 --> 08:04.649
May I see you, please.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.525
You wanted to see me,

08:13.527 --> 08:15.560
-Professor Grandacre?
-Yes.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.796
Look, I just want
to make sure

08:17.798 --> 08:18.997
you're not
one of these students

08:18.999 --> 08:20.832
who thinks they can
rely on their good looks

08:20.834 --> 08:22.634
and their charm just
to get a good grade.

08:23.603 --> 08:25.203
Absolutely not!

08:26.639 --> 08:29.608
I'm on full scholarship
so let me assure you,

08:29.610 --> 08:31.810
I take my grades
very seriously.

08:31.812 --> 08:34.212
Good.
I'm relieved to hear it.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.714
Good. I'm glad.

08:37.082 --> 08:39.251
I've worked very hard
to get where I am today.

08:40.219 --> 08:41.586
Very hard.

08:43.188 --> 08:44.623
Thank you.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.291
Thank you, Mrs. Grandacre.

08:53.599 --> 08:55.734
Sounds like you really
shut her down, man.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.802
Listen, if anyone can handle
Grandacre, though, it's you.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.170
You already know it!

09:01.007 --> 09:02.941
Do you think
that's about McDeere?

09:04.010 --> 09:06.111
How should I know?

09:06.113 --> 09:08.146
They say he OD'd on
his meds, man.

09:10.316 --> 09:11.983
You need a ride home?

09:11.985 --> 09:14.219
No, thanks.
I've got my bike.

09:17.323 --> 09:20.025
Vance! Vance!

09:20.027 --> 09:21.693
Claire Hart?

09:21.695 --> 09:24.596
Daughter of the Donald Hart,

09:24.598 --> 09:26.932
as in, Lawson-Hart
School of Law, Hart?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.633
The one and only.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.735
You have got no shot.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.971
Care to wager a beer?

09:32.973 --> 09:34.239
You're on!

09:38.945 --> 09:41.646
Hi Vance.
I'm glad I caught you.

09:41.648 --> 09:43.248
Yeah, I'm glad
you did too, Claire.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.686
Oh. Claire, Arthur.
Arthur, Claire.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.790
Arthur was just leaving.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.325
What?

09:53.327 --> 09:56.828
Oh. Yeah. I was...

09:56.830 --> 09:58.229
Nice meeting you.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.598
Bye.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.066
So, I just wanted
to tell you

10:01.068 --> 10:03.768
that I saw on the board we're
going to be trial partners.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.371
Wow! A Hart for
an opponent!

10:06.373 --> 10:09.074
Looks like I have my work
cut out for me.

10:09.076 --> 10:12.110
I mean, with all
that free advice...

10:12.112 --> 10:13.945
Oh, no. Not really.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.280
My dad says
doing this on my own

10:15.282 --> 10:16.915
will make me
a better lawyer, so...

10:16.917 --> 10:18.617
That's one of
the many reasons

10:18.619 --> 10:19.918
many reasons I
don't go to his school.

10:20.853 --> 10:22.087
Probably a smart move.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.356
So why did you pick defense?

10:24.358 --> 10:29.728
I prefer to make sure
innocent people are
not wrongly convicted.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.396
Yes, but you're
going to wind up

10:31.398 --> 10:33.298
defending the guilty
a lot of the time.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.066
I'm okay with that.

10:47.413 --> 10:49.314
You will be mine.

10:50.783 --> 10:52.217
Oho! Or not.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.952
Come on!

10:56.122 --> 10:57.656
Dude!

10:57.658 --> 10:59.824
Vance, are you crazy?

10:59.826 --> 11:02.227
Relax. If I thought
you'd stand a chance,

11:02.229 --> 11:03.928
-I wouldn't have done it.
-Wow.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.397
Bravo.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.199
Hey. Check this out.

11:12.905 --> 11:14.272
What?!

11:15.341 --> 11:18.043
You got Claire's
digits? Man!

11:18.045 --> 11:19.411
I guess I do owe
you that beer.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.046
Oh, you owe me
a lot more than that.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.715
I let you crash here
at my awesome hideout.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.216
Yeah, I don't
really get it, man.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.718
Why don't you
stay here with me?

11:26.720 --> 11:28.153
Your dad gave it to you,

11:28.155 --> 11:30.288
but you stay with your mom
and your dipstick step-dad,

11:30.290 --> 11:32.924
who you hate,
and he hates you.

11:32.926 --> 11:36.027
No, man. Too many
bad memories here.

11:36.029 --> 11:39.197
I like to just use it
when I want to stay
anonymous, you know.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.232
Besides, I like to keep
an eye out for my mom.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.434
Make sure she's okay.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.704
-Fair enough.
-Hey!

11:45.706 --> 11:48.873
Here's that essay you wanted
on civil disobedience.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.275
You are a life saver.

11:50.277 --> 11:53.078
Hey! Remember to reword it.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.879
Don't I always?

11:54.881 --> 11:57.916
Thank you. You are
a life saver, my friend.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.852
And you're a
profitable enterprise.

12:53.539 --> 12:57.041
"While courts normally
award damages to
victims of negligence,

12:57.043 --> 12:59.544
"those damages may
be reduced if the
victims themselves

12:59.546 --> 13:01.412
"are found to be negligent.

13:01.414 --> 13:05.183
"However, in a precedent-setting
case, Gough vs. Thorne,

13:05.185 --> 13:07.318
"the court decided
to waive culpability

13:07.320 --> 13:09.120
"in the case of
a young child.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.555
"Sui generis rule,

13:10.557 --> 13:13.024
"setting aside previously
established rule

13:13.026 --> 13:15.059
in order to impart justice."

13:33.245 --> 13:35.013
You're late.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.115
Dinner's getting cold.

13:49.862 --> 13:51.896
Hi, honey.
How was your day?

13:53.365 --> 13:55.166
Where were you?

13:56.168 --> 13:58.436
I was at the library,
working.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.039
I'm so proud of you.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.440
One more year and
you'll be a real lawyer.

14:03.609 --> 14:05.610
They serve beer at
the library now, do they?

14:08.280 --> 14:10.081
Go on, I made
your favorites.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.851
You were supposed to work
with me at the garage today.

14:13.854 --> 14:17.555
I give you room and board,
and you come down and help me.

14:17.557 --> 14:22.093
I carry a full load of
classes and have to
get perfect grades

14:22.095 --> 14:23.494
or I lose my scholarship.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.530
He's right, Paul.
Honey, maybe you could

14:25.532 --> 14:27.198
give some hours on
Saturday or something.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.600
I'll tell you what I get.

14:28.602 --> 14:30.001
Bills up the kazoo.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.870
I bust my butt,
twenty-four/six,

14:31.872 --> 14:33.104
just to keep our
heads above water--

14:33.106 --> 14:34.606
-Maybe you should have
worked harder in school.

14:34.608 --> 14:36.441
-You know what else I get?
I get food on the table

14:36.443 --> 14:40.011
for your mother and you
and a roof over your head.

14:40.013 --> 14:43.081
And now I get
a 23-year-old deadbeat,
living off his old man!

14:43.083 --> 14:45.550
I told you.
You are not my old man!

14:45.552 --> 14:47.385
Damn right I'm not!

14:47.387 --> 14:49.153
I don't go out boozing

14:49.155 --> 14:50.955
and stealing cars,
and then...

14:50.957 --> 14:52.423
hang myself in jail.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.192
What kind of
a father does that?

14:54.194 --> 14:56.027
And what kind of a man
marries his brother's wife

14:56.029 --> 14:58.296
two weeks after
the funeral, huh?

14:58.298 --> 15:01.366
-I'll kill you!
-Vance! Stop, oh!

15:01.368 --> 15:03.234
Stop. Stop!

15:03.236 --> 15:05.436
I'm sorry, Mom.
I lost my appetite.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.908
I'll be in my room...

15:09.910 --> 15:11.376
working!

15:17.416 --> 15:19.517
Your kid
has got no respect.

15:21.553 --> 15:22.954
None!

17:32.785 --> 17:34.685
Hey, honey!

17:37.322 --> 17:38.656
You're late.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.259
Yeah. Long day.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.794
You know how that goes.

17:42.796 --> 17:46.197
Yeah. But I'm only doing
two days a week now, so...

17:47.533 --> 17:49.367
not the way you know.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.702
Isn't that the most
gorgeous thing
you've ever seen?

17:53.072 --> 17:55.807
Hmm. Bet you say that
about all the books.

17:55.809 --> 17:58.142
Besides, I thought I was.

17:58.144 --> 18:00.311
You are.
But you're no...

18:00.313 --> 18:02.113
rare illuminated Chaucer.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.650
And I was just about
to click "purchase," too.

18:07.186 --> 18:09.587
But, it's too
extravagant, isn't it.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.256
Sure. I...

18:12.258 --> 18:15.593
-Can I splurge?
-Sure. Yeah.

18:18.197 --> 18:19.330
Is there anything wrong?

18:20.732 --> 18:22.633
No.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.469
-Nothing's wrong. Why?
-Because I'm about to

18:24.471 --> 18:27.405
spend $800 on a book
and that's fine to you.

18:27.407 --> 18:30.441
You're off in
la-la land, somewhere.
What's going on?

18:30.443 --> 18:33.144
Oh gosh. I don't know.

18:33.146 --> 18:36.547
It's one of these new
transfer students of mine.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.516
He is extremely bright.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.852
I read one of
his old papers and he

18:40.854 --> 18:44.322
analyzed this precedent-setting
case like a pro.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.790
It was impressive.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.191
So what's the problem?

18:47.193 --> 18:48.559
I don't know.

18:48.561 --> 18:53.731
His overall... demeanor
in class is arrogant.

18:53.733 --> 18:57.201
Did this happen to take place
during an ethics lesson?

18:57.203 --> 19:02.240
You know how I feel
when they don't take
the rules seriously.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.709
If I can just spare one
of them from making
the same mistake that I--

19:04.711 --> 19:06.744
You can't. You can't.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.312
The best you
could ever hope for

19:08.314 --> 19:10.148
is that they learn
something useful from it.

19:10.150 --> 19:13.451
And honey, your only mistake
was being a little naive.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.853
But you learned that there are
vultures out there, didn't you?

19:15.855 --> 19:18.189
And you learned
how to survive.

20:35.434 --> 20:36.601
Damn it!

20:39.271 --> 20:41.839
This ruins my case.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.341
Can't use this.

20:56.822 --> 20:58.823
Hey, Professor Grandacre.
Do you have a second?

20:58.825 --> 21:00.591
Uh, actually no.
I have a class right now

21:00.593 --> 21:02.026
but if you want to make a--

21:02.028 --> 21:03.995
It's about the mock trial.
I need more time.

21:03.997 --> 21:05.930
Ah, yeah,
you and everyone else.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.299
Listen, despite what
you may have heard.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.468
I, in no way,
expect perfection.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.502
Just do the best you can.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.304
Yeah, but, I do...

21:13.306 --> 21:15.439
so if you could just

21:15.441 --> 21:17.775
switch me with
someone presenting later?

21:17.777 --> 21:19.510
No. I can't.
It's too late.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.679
And it wouldn't be fair to
the others or your partner.

21:21.681 --> 21:24.315
It's what I said
in class, isn't it?

21:24.317 --> 21:25.983
The lame remarks?
Look. I'm sorry--

21:25.985 --> 21:27.685
It has nothing
to do with that, okay?

21:27.687 --> 21:30.721
I cannot offer you more time
and not offer it to the others.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.323
I can't make one rule for you

21:32.325 --> 21:33.991
and a different rule
for the rest of the class.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.727
What if there were
extenuating circumstances?

21:36.729 --> 21:38.562
Such as?

21:40.866 --> 21:43.868
Look, Mr. Van Sickle,
my best advice to you

21:43.870 --> 21:46.704
is just to buckle down
and do the best you can.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.339
Excuse me.

21:54.913 --> 21:57.048
Yo! Yo! Van, Van!

21:57.050 --> 21:58.549
I need to tell
you something--

21:58.551 --> 21:59.617
-Not now, man.
-Hey, dude--

21:59.619 --> 22:01.686
-Don't touch me, man.
-Whoa!

22:01.688 --> 22:03.554
Bro! I was just going
to say that I...

22:05.857 --> 22:08.459
God! Dude!

22:38.757 --> 22:40.891
And so, in summary,

22:40.893 --> 22:44.595
my client's speed was not
the cause of the accident.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.731
The main cause, in fact,
was the plaintiff,

22:46.733 --> 22:51.569
Your Honor,
according to the Doctrine
of Comparative Negligence

22:51.571 --> 22:53.471
I do not have to prove
that the defendant's

22:53.473 --> 22:55.539
negligence was the sole
cause of the accident.

22:55.541 --> 22:56.841
Just a contributing factor.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.776
Look, at 3:00 pm,
in front of a school,

22:58.778 --> 23:00.978
regardless of his speed,
it was foreseeable

23:00.980 --> 23:03.748
that a 6-year-old child
might run into the street.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.617
Foreseeable? Come on!

23:06.619 --> 23:08.953
Is the prosecution suggesting

23:08.955 --> 23:10.688
my client should
have been clairvoyant?

23:10.690 --> 23:12.757
This was not a
pedestrian crossing.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.625
There was no
crossing guard present.

23:15.660 --> 23:16.961
The court must recognize

23:16.963 --> 23:19.930
that the plaintiff was
contributorily negligent

23:19.932 --> 23:22.733
In support, I cite the case
of Froom vs. Butcher.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.068
"In cases where

23:24.070 --> 23:26.937
"the plaintiff's own
culpable conduct is a factor

23:26.939 --> 23:29.473
"the court shall reduce
the award of any damages

23:29.475 --> 23:32.543
according to the level
of the fault of the plaintiff."

23:32.545 --> 23:34.111
Miss Hart,

23:34.113 --> 23:36.480
can you offer me any
reasons why the court

23:36.482 --> 23:38.616
would not find your
client culpable?

23:38.618 --> 23:40.651
She's a child, your honor.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.086
I mean, is that fair?

23:42.088 --> 23:44.955
Be that as it may,
this is a court of law.

23:44.957 --> 23:48.492
As such, we are only concerned
with statutes and precedents,

23:48.494 --> 23:50.995
not notions of fairness.

23:50.997 --> 23:53.631
Can you cite any precedents?

23:53.633 --> 23:55.499
I, um...

23:57.836 --> 23:59.770
No, your honor.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.106
I have one more
thing to add, your honor.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.642
Under the modified Comparative
Negligence rule,

24:04.644 --> 24:06.177
if the plaintiff's
own negligence

24:06.179 --> 24:08.679
constitutes more than
50% of the fault,

24:08.681 --> 24:11.715
the plaintiff is not entitled
to any damages at all.

24:11.717 --> 24:13.751
-Wait! Objection. 50%--

24:13.753 --> 24:14.985
The child did run into

24:14.987 --> 24:16.854
a busy street, between
parked cars, your honor.

24:18.657 --> 24:20.524
Objection overruled.

24:20.526 --> 24:23.994
I do have one final question
for you, Mr. Van Sickle.

24:23.996 --> 24:26.197
Is there any reason
you know of,

24:26.199 --> 24:30.000
why the court should
not reduce the award
to the plaintiff?

24:30.002 --> 24:33.070
Well, based on the
given circumstances

24:33.072 --> 24:35.206
and the current laws
of this state,

24:35.208 --> 24:37.241
none whatsoever.

24:38.777 --> 24:40.478
You're certain?

24:40.480 --> 24:43.113
Well based on my
research, absolutely!

24:47.886 --> 24:49.520
Very well.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.755
I, uh, find for
the prosecution.

24:53.925 --> 24:55.226
This court is adjourned.

24:55.228 --> 24:57.127
What? You mean I won?

24:58.196 --> 24:59.930
Congratulations, Miss Hart.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.265
Are you kidding me?

25:01.267 --> 25:02.733
I proved my case.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.202
I am very disappointed
in you Mr. Van Sickle.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.271
Gough vs. Thorne.

25:07.273 --> 25:10.674
Sui generis rule: "A child
under the age of seven

25:10.676 --> 25:13.043
cannot be held responsible
for his conduct."

25:13.045 --> 25:14.879
You wrote an essay on it for

25:14.881 --> 25:16.280
Professor McDeere's class.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.682
It was eloquently
written, in fact.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.719
I could not have more
strongly emphasized

25:21.721 --> 25:23.787
that an attorney
has an obligation

25:23.789 --> 25:24.855
to fully disclose

25:24.857 --> 25:26.790
any relevant material.

25:26.792 --> 25:29.894
My first obligation
is to my client, okay.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.695
It was the prosecution's
responsibility

25:31.697 --> 25:34.265
to find the cases that
support her argument.

25:36.101 --> 25:38.168
Why are you penalizing me
for her stupid mistake?

25:38.170 --> 25:41.872
Would you please
excuse us, Miss Hart.

25:51.182 --> 25:53.884
You well know,
by not citing that case

25:53.886 --> 25:55.286
you broke Rule 3.

25:55.288 --> 25:57.955
That case would have sunk
my whole defense.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.557
That is irrelevant.

25:59.559 --> 26:01.959
You are missing the whole
point of this exercise.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.028
The goal was not
to necessarily win

26:04.030 --> 26:06.297
but to play
the game ethically.

26:06.299 --> 26:07.598
You had other

26:07.600 --> 26:09.233
options, Mr. Van Sickle.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.036
You could have argued
that Gough vs. Thorne

26:12.038 --> 26:14.338
didn't apply to this case,
or simply acknowledged

26:14.340 --> 26:16.173
that because
of the child's age

26:16.175 --> 26:18.142
the award should not
have been reduced.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.843
Okay, well, how will
this affect my grade?

26:20.946 --> 26:22.212
Look...

26:23.281 --> 26:24.882
Grades will be
out next week.

26:24.884 --> 26:27.585
-I need to know now!
-Okay.

26:27.587 --> 26:29.920
What you just did was
tantamount to cheating.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.722
This is your final exam.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.223
You know the penalty.

26:34.292 --> 26:35.893
You think you can fail me?

26:36.861 --> 26:38.195
You did this to yourself.

26:38.197 --> 26:40.230
Let go of me, Vance.

26:49.140 --> 26:50.608
Ugh!

27:09.394 --> 27:11.895
Oh good. You're here.

27:11.897 --> 27:13.631
Dean Castle wants
to see you at 4:00.

27:13.633 --> 27:17.234
Oh. Uh, maybe it's about
my grant application.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.836
Here,

27:18.838 --> 27:21.038
it looks like you need
this more than I do.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.640
Am I misunderstanding?

27:22.642 --> 27:24.708
Are you saying that
the approval of my grant is

27:24.710 --> 27:26.877
somehow dependent on
Mr. Van Sickle's grade?

27:26.879 --> 27:28.112
No. Of course not.

27:28.114 --> 27:32.049
But, we cannot risk
an appeal hearing.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.985
Now look, Van Sickle

27:34.987 --> 27:38.389
is under the sponsorship
of Lawson-Hart,

27:38.391 --> 27:40.891
at this university's
recommendation, so,

27:40.893 --> 27:44.828
if they don't get the expected
return on their investment

27:44.830 --> 27:47.297
they just might consider
pulling future investment.

27:48.233 --> 27:49.333
Catch my drift?

27:49.335 --> 27:51.835
Oh, I'm starting to.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.837
Other benefactors
may follow suit

27:53.839 --> 27:56.340
and without that investment,

27:56.342 --> 27:59.943
we'd have to consider
pulling other programs...

27:59.945 --> 28:01.345
like your grant.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.814
The grant to establish
an ethics board?

28:03.816 --> 28:07.351
Huh, yeah, well,
it's ironic I know, but, uh,

28:07.353 --> 28:11.455
no funds... no grants.

28:13.024 --> 28:14.224
It's as simple as that.

28:16.161 --> 28:17.227
Ugh!

28:17.229 --> 28:18.429
Abby...

28:20.699 --> 28:22.800
Look. For two years,

28:22.802 --> 28:25.903
until your final exam,

28:25.905 --> 28:28.772
the boy was able to maintain

28:28.774 --> 28:32.042
a B+ average to secure
his scholarship.

28:32.044 --> 28:35.879
So, all I'm suggesting
is that you investigate

28:35.881 --> 28:38.882
to see if there are
other circumstances

28:38.884 --> 28:42.019
that might warrant
consideration. Okay?

28:42.021 --> 28:44.722
Look, he deserves
at least that much.

28:44.724 --> 28:48.759
Oh. Did Mr. Van Sickle
happen to mention

28:48.761 --> 28:51.428
why he failed? Did he?

28:51.430 --> 28:54.164
-He misled the court.
-Abby, you know

28:54.166 --> 28:58.969
I would never condone
breaking the rules. Right?

29:00.772 --> 29:03.507
But... sometimes you've just
got to bend them a little.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.743
Ahh. I don't believe it.

29:05.745 --> 29:09.179
It's an ethics class!
What...?

29:10.448 --> 29:12.983
Okay, okay, fine!

29:12.985 --> 29:15.419
Then, look, how about
a compromise, huh?

29:15.421 --> 29:17.955
I mean...
have him have

29:17.957 --> 29:19.289
an "incomplete" now,
instead of an F.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.325
You know, let him do
a make-up test

29:21.327 --> 29:22.993
or a paper or something,
I mean--

29:22.995 --> 29:25.996
A make-up test? Final
grades are due next week.

29:27.031 --> 29:28.499
I'll give you
a week extension.

29:28.501 --> 29:31.168
Okay? Yeah, yeah.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.470
A week extension.
Anything but a hearing!

29:37.176 --> 29:38.275
Fine.

29:38.277 --> 29:41.211
Fine. I'll agree.

29:41.213 --> 29:45.215
Okay, if he can get in
an assignment by next week

29:45.217 --> 29:47.851
and you agree
that his final grade

29:47.853 --> 29:50.154
depends on
that assignment.

29:50.156 --> 29:53.257
Fair enough.
All right.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.325
See...

29:56.327 --> 29:58.362
a little flexibility.

29:58.364 --> 29:59.396
No harm done.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.168
Oh, no. Thank you.

30:15.346 --> 30:17.147
So tell me...

30:17.149 --> 30:18.949
Just politics.

30:18.951 --> 30:21.351
Hey, can you pull up McDeere's
grades on a particular student?

30:21.353 --> 30:22.386
Sure.

30:26.891 --> 30:28.992
Enjoy your night, ladies.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.261
Okay.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.231
Okay, 4,3,2,

30:34.233 --> 30:37.167
-2,3,4. That's an easy one.
-Beyond easy!

30:37.169 --> 30:39.069
Legal Profession A,

30:39.071 --> 30:41.605
Van Sickle, Vance.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.307
Is that the one
that failed trial?

30:43.309 --> 30:44.408
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.848
Well that's an A- average.

30:50.850 --> 30:54.318
-Oh, with your F.
-Yeah. I know. Thanks.

30:54.320 --> 30:58.188
Mullnomah Blvd.
That's off Highway 12, right?

30:58.190 --> 31:00.924
Yeah. That's the other side
of the tracks.

31:00.926 --> 31:03.026
He must have worked really
hard to get here.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.037
God, I can't believe I let
him get away with that.

31:15.073 --> 31:16.607
What was that?

31:16.609 --> 31:19.009
He grabbed my arm
today. Hard!

31:20.345 --> 31:22.212
-Did you tell Castle?
-Yeah.

31:22.214 --> 31:25.515
Well, I tried. No.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.050
Abby! Why the hell not?

31:28.019 --> 31:29.553
That is totally
unacceptable!

31:29.555 --> 31:31.588
Why wouldn't you go
straight to Castle with that?

31:31.590 --> 31:33.490
Don't you think I know that.
Because I want the grant.

31:33.492 --> 31:36.193
He had me over
a barrel, okay?

31:36.195 --> 31:38.095
No funds, no grant.

31:38.097 --> 31:40.097
What are you doing?

31:40.099 --> 31:42.666
What are you doing!

31:42.668 --> 31:45.235
Were you planning to hide
these from me again?

31:46.571 --> 31:48.071
When did you
start up with these?

31:48.073 --> 31:50.340
You know what?
Here, stop it!

31:50.342 --> 31:52.075
-Look at you!
-Are you happy?

31:52.077 --> 31:53.977
-You are so wound up!
-I get, I get headaches!

31:53.979 --> 31:56.313
You're about to snap!

31:56.315 --> 31:58.482
Is this kid somehow
triggering some of

31:58.484 --> 32:00.250
your past issues,
or something?

32:00.252 --> 32:01.985
I have not seen you
like this in a long time.

32:01.987 --> 32:03.587
-Really?
-Yeah!

32:03.589 --> 32:05.589
-My past issues?
-Okay, why are you getting
headaches then?

32:06.658 --> 32:08.225
Why are you getting
nightmares?

32:08.227 --> 32:11.295
I see you at night, you're
having nightmares. Why?

32:11.297 --> 32:13.530
It's been three years. Why?

32:13.532 --> 32:15.365
And what's next?
The panic attacks?

32:15.367 --> 32:17.935
I think we need
to find someone--

32:17.937 --> 32:20.237
Oh, you want to
find somebody?
Shall we find somebody?

32:20.239 --> 32:23.073
A therapist? Are they going
to grade my papers for me?

32:23.075 --> 32:26.076
Are they going to deal
with this situation with
the kid and Castle--

32:26.078 --> 32:27.177
They can help you!

32:28.479 --> 32:29.713
These pills...

32:30.715 --> 32:32.382
are not going
to help you.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.318
Are they? We know that!

32:38.222 --> 32:42.492
I have had
a really long day.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.528
I am tired.
I just want to go to sleep.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.563
I want to wake up
and start over.

32:50.068 --> 32:52.436
Look. It's just
a few more weeks.

32:52.438 --> 32:55.138
I'll either get the grant,
or I won't.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.407
Okay, the,
the situation with the kid

32:57.409 --> 32:59.977
and Castle,
it will get resolved.

32:59.979 --> 33:02.012
If this is still
happening then,

33:02.014 --> 33:03.647
I will talk to someone.

33:05.450 --> 33:06.650
Okay?

34:57.195 --> 34:58.261
Hey.

34:58.263 --> 34:59.362
Hey.

35:00.364 --> 35:01.698
You okay?

35:01.700 --> 35:05.168
Uh... No. I'm not.

35:06.404 --> 35:07.571
What is it?

35:07.573 --> 35:09.706
The same thing
happened to him.

35:12.143 --> 35:14.244
Who and what are
you talking about?

35:14.246 --> 35:17.814
The student
that I was telling you
about last night...

35:19.484 --> 35:21.852
His father was wrongly
convicted. And...

35:22.787 --> 35:26.123
he hung himself.

35:26.125 --> 35:30.193
Okay. I think you should
take a nice deep breath

35:30.195 --> 35:32.195
and try not to let
all that pain and guilt

35:32.197 --> 35:34.531
come rushing back to you,
after all your hard work.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.334
I did that to someone.

35:37.336 --> 35:40.904
I did that to someone and
it and the same outcome.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.240
We've been over
this a million times.

35:43.242 --> 35:46.209
You have to stop blaming
yourself for doing your job.

35:46.211 --> 35:49.212
Stan, that is easier
said than done.

35:50.381 --> 35:52.349
Look. I have to go.
I'm working.

35:53.651 --> 35:54.751
Abby?

36:17.175 --> 36:19.342
Oh... Vance.

36:20.278 --> 36:21.711
You're, uh, you're early.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.446
Is this a bad time?

36:23.448 --> 36:25.849
No. Not at all.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.852
You just caught me
taking my allergy medication.

36:31.422 --> 36:32.689
Sorry.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.431
Allergies are
the worst. Right?

36:41.433 --> 36:42.933
Huh. Yes.

36:42.935 --> 36:46.236
-So you heard I appealed?
-Yeah. I did.

36:46.238 --> 36:49.472
And I talked to Dean Castle,

36:49.474 --> 36:51.341
and he has offered a solution

36:51.343 --> 36:52.976
which I am willing to consider

36:52.978 --> 36:55.345
as long as we can
come to an agreement.

36:55.347 --> 36:57.347
I'm relieved to hear that.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.316
Well, your past records

36:59.318 --> 37:01.785
have earned you
that consideration.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.620
Your lowest grade is a B.

37:03.622 --> 37:07.724
That's impressive,
and you've only gotten
one of them.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.994
I do realize the impact
your grades have on your
position here

37:10.996 --> 37:13.263
so that's why I'm
willing to reconsider.

37:13.998 --> 37:15.398
I really appreciate that.

37:16.534 --> 37:17.701
Do you remember

37:17.703 --> 37:19.769
the day I stopped
you in the hall

37:19.771 --> 37:22.339
and mentioned
extenuating circumstances?

37:23.408 --> 37:27.744
reluctant to tell you
the truth, because I...

37:28.713 --> 37:29.846
I didn't want you to think

37:29.848 --> 37:31.848
I was playing
the sympathy card.

37:33.384 --> 37:35.485
My mom's been
fighting cancer.

37:36.954 --> 37:38.555
Oh God.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.693
Vance, I'm-- I am so sorry.

37:43.695 --> 37:44.961
So when I found
Gough vs. Thorne

37:44.963 --> 37:47.564
I realized I'd have to
rework my whole defense.

37:49.834 --> 37:51.901
Normally I'd be up to
the challenge, but

37:51.903 --> 37:54.537
spending so much time
at the hospital...

37:55.773 --> 37:57.707
watching her suffer.

37:57.709 --> 38:00.877
Then with my
other finals...

38:00.879 --> 38:04.481
and helping out at home.
Not eating. Not sleeping.

38:05.816 --> 38:08.752
Did you ever feel
so... overwhelmed

38:08.754 --> 38:10.353
that you thought
you'd just...

38:11.722 --> 38:13.390
totally lose it?

38:15.793 --> 38:19.062
Yeah. Of course.

38:19.064 --> 38:21.898
I think everyone has at
some point in their life.

38:25.036 --> 38:27.871
So you, um, you
mentioned a solution?

38:29.473 --> 38:31.441
Um, yeah, yes.

38:31.443 --> 38:34.544
Uh, Dean Castle
and I agreed that

38:34.546 --> 38:36.713
should circumstances warrant,

38:36.715 --> 38:38.982
which I now see
that they do,

38:38.984 --> 38:41.651
and you were
willing to, uh,

38:41.653 --> 38:44.521
do a make-up exam
by next week,

38:44.523 --> 38:48.091
I'd be willing to
change the failure
into the deserving grade.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.426
Wow!

38:50.394 --> 38:52.462
Sure, I'll do anything.

38:52.464 --> 38:54.664
My whole future
is at stake.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.100
I'm sure you'll
do just fine.

38:57.102 --> 39:00.103
I'll have the make-up
assignment by tomorrow.

39:01.605 --> 39:02.839
I don't know how
to thank you.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.008
Look, just

39:05.010 --> 39:08.011
follow the rules.
That's thanks enough.

39:09.814 --> 39:11.815
I understand your passion.

39:16.053 --> 39:17.721
I read your father's case.

39:22.727 --> 39:24.627
So now you know
why I'm so determined

39:24.629 --> 39:26.429
to succeed here
and become a defense lawyer.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.065
To protect other innocents

39:29.067 --> 39:30.900
from false convictions.

39:34.538 --> 39:35.972
Thank you, Mrs. Grandacre.

40:03.802 --> 40:06.703
Hi. This is Professor Grandacre

40:06.705 --> 40:08.004
from Green Cove University--

40:08.006 --> 40:09.672
What did he do now?

40:10.708 --> 40:11.875
Excuse me?

40:11.877 --> 40:13.710
Vance! What did he do now?

40:13.712 --> 40:15.111
Uh, no, no.

40:15.113 --> 40:18.081
I'm sorry, I--
Who am I speaking with?

40:18.083 --> 40:19.916
His stepfather.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.918
Oh, okay, uh--

40:21.920 --> 40:24.821
I was just calling
to check because I was--

40:24.823 --> 40:26.589
I was a bit
concerned about Vance

40:26.591 --> 40:29.092
and all he's been
dealing with, with
his mother's sickness.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.794
What the hell are
you talking about?

40:32.430 --> 40:35.131
I'm sorry. I, uh--

40:35.133 --> 40:37.767
My wife is perfectly healthy.

40:37.769 --> 40:40.069
Look. I don't know what
that boy's been telling you,

40:40.071 --> 40:42.939
Professor, but I'd be
careful what you believe.

40:53.818 --> 40:55.118
Yeah.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.654
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

40:57.656 --> 40:58.922
What?

41:08.532 --> 41:09.699
Hey!

41:09.701 --> 41:11.568
Jeez!

41:11.570 --> 41:12.836
Don't even think about

41:12.838 --> 41:14.237
touching those guns. Ever!

41:17.074 --> 41:18.942
That's what my dad
used to say to me.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.910
Why are you
so cranky, man?

41:20.912 --> 41:23.179
Thought you said
Grandacre fell for it.

41:23.181 --> 41:25.048
Yeah. She did.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.817
But how the hell was
I supposed to know
she'd call my house.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.953
She's gonna pull my make-up
assignment from me now.

41:29.955 --> 41:31.521
Man, you are screwed.

41:31.523 --> 41:33.089
She's going to
fail your butt!

41:33.091 --> 41:35.024
There's got to be a way.

41:35.026 --> 41:36.826
Think of something, dammit!

41:36.828 --> 41:39.229
Have you ever searched her?

41:39.231 --> 41:40.964
I mean, there's nowhere
to hide on the net, man.

41:40.966 --> 41:43.600
Maybe we can find
something incriminating.

41:43.602 --> 41:45.034
Come on.
Let's check it out.

41:48.005 --> 41:49.606
I got this.

41:58.015 --> 42:00.617
Whoa!
Check this out, man.

42:00.619 --> 42:02.118
It sounds like your dad.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.853
"Still proclaiming
his innocence,

42:03.855 --> 42:06.689
"John Ross, convicted
of grand larceny,

42:06.691 --> 42:09.559
"prosecuted by A.D.A.
Abigail Grandacre

42:09.561 --> 42:12.228
hanged himself in a courthouse
holding cell today."

42:12.230 --> 42:13.997
You've got
to be kidding me.

42:13.999 --> 42:15.598
"The case raises

42:15.600 --> 42:17.166
"embarrassing questions
for the D.A.

42:17.168 --> 42:21.037
"Especially since A.D.A.
Grandacre failed to mention

42:21.039 --> 42:22.639
"that there was a witness
who came forward

42:22.641 --> 42:24.674
to offer Ross an alibi."

42:24.676 --> 42:27.043
Then what?

42:27.045 --> 42:29.546
Says she resigned before they
filed any criminal charges.

42:29.548 --> 42:31.614
She got away with it

42:31.616 --> 42:33.149
and she failed me
on an ethics charge!

42:33.151 --> 42:35.618
Wait, hold on.

42:35.620 --> 42:37.854
Whoa! Hold on.
There's more.

42:37.856 --> 42:41.591
A couple of months
later she was put
into a mental institution.

42:41.593 --> 42:44.327
She's psycho, man! Ha!

42:44.329 --> 42:48.231
I can use this.
I'll ruin her.

42:48.233 --> 42:50.900
You're not going to, like,
do something crazy, are you?

42:53.871 --> 42:55.939
I need a way to get
into the grade site

42:55.941 --> 42:57.106
and change my grade myself.

42:57.108 --> 42:58.808
Okay. That is crazy.

42:58.810 --> 43:01.010
I mean, this site's
probably fire-walled
up the kazoo.

43:01.012 --> 43:03.613
What are you going to do?
Break into her house

43:03.615 --> 43:04.948
and hack into her computer?

43:07.351 --> 43:08.685
And you're going
to help me.

43:09.653 --> 43:11.888
No. No, I am not.

43:11.890 --> 43:13.156
That's breaking and entering.

43:13.158 --> 43:14.757
No, no, no. Listen.

43:14.759 --> 43:17.794
All you have to do is

43:17.796 --> 43:20.730
be my driver
and my lookout.

43:23.601 --> 43:26.269
Well, unless you'd rather
cop to cheating all year.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.971
And you still have
two more year's worth

43:27.973 --> 43:30.940
of papers you'll
be needing. Hey,

43:30.942 --> 43:32.375
tell you what...

43:33.677 --> 43:36.179
I'll make you
the deal of a lifetime.

43:36.181 --> 43:38.314
You help me out

43:38.316 --> 43:40.383
and I'll give you all
of my old A-papers...

43:41.619 --> 43:42.852
free.

43:42.854 --> 43:46.322
Okay, but just
the lookout and driver.

45:04.034 --> 45:05.968
Hey. So I'll meet
you at 12:00,

45:05.970 --> 45:08.037
but if you need anything
I'll be in my office, okay?

45:08.039 --> 45:09.272
Okay, bye.

45:49.146 --> 45:51.214
Aah! Professor G.

45:51.216 --> 45:53.783
Mr. Fine. What are you
doing in this building?

45:56.320 --> 45:58.888
I haven't graded
your final yet.

45:58.890 --> 46:01.858
Grant vs. Foster was
the main case though, right?

46:13.471 --> 46:16.472
I will be happy to go over
everything with you.

46:16.474 --> 46:18.341
But right now I have
a ton of papers to grade,

46:18.343 --> 46:19.776
including yours.

46:19.778 --> 46:22.078
Okay, cool!
That's awesome!

46:22.080 --> 46:23.112
Excuse me.

46:24.248 --> 46:25.414
Sorry.

46:40.198 --> 46:41.798
Oh!

46:57.447 --> 46:58.948
Have you seen him yet?

46:58.950 --> 47:00.449
No.

47:00.451 --> 47:02.985
No, I sent him
a message informing him

47:02.987 --> 47:05.221
that the make-up assignment
was off the table.

47:05.223 --> 47:06.856
And I referred
him to you.

47:06.858 --> 47:08.357
Yes. He called to
make an appointment.

47:10.427 --> 47:12.962
He sounded really desperate.

47:12.964 --> 47:15.031
Look, in my book,
there is no excuse

47:15.033 --> 47:17.133
for this kind of
blatant dishonesty.

47:17.135 --> 47:19.468
Actions have consequences.

47:19.470 --> 47:21.103
Yes, they do.

47:22.406 --> 47:23.873
For all of us.

47:24.875 --> 47:26.609
But...

47:26.611 --> 47:30.413
you gave him every
benefit of the doubt,
as I asked. And...

47:31.548 --> 47:33.249
well, given his actions...

47:34.985 --> 47:37.620
there's no other decision
that can be reached.

47:40.157 --> 47:42.558
Well. He seems like a...

47:43.527 --> 47:45.394
very resourceful
young man.

47:47.164 --> 47:49.232
Perhaps he'll find
another way.

47:49.234 --> 47:53.102
If nothing else, he
certainly is resourceful.

48:15.292 --> 48:17.460
-Have a good weekend.
-You too.

48:17.462 --> 48:19.061
Hello, professor.

48:19.063 --> 48:21.998
Hey, I just want you
to know, I understand.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.466
You're just doing your job.

48:23.468 --> 48:25.001
No hard feelings.

48:27.204 --> 48:29.572
I will break you.

48:32.509 --> 48:34.277
Are you threatening me?

48:35.946 --> 48:38.014
Excuse me?
What did I say?

48:39.316 --> 48:40.616
I couldn't hear you.

48:42.052 --> 48:43.552
Mr. Van Sickle.

48:45.022 --> 48:46.489
I think you'd better
come inside.

49:57.194 --> 49:58.394
Joe?

50:51.481 --> 50:53.749
God!

51:00.190 --> 51:01.690
What's going on?

51:01.692 --> 51:03.225
I just saw something

51:03.227 --> 51:05.161
just run out in front
of the car. It was--

51:05.163 --> 51:07.563
It looked like a person
but it was faster.

51:07.565 --> 51:10.699
-Hm. Was probably a coyote.
-No. It was bigger than that.

51:10.701 --> 51:12.234
A deer then.

51:13.203 --> 51:15.438
I'm sure it was nothing.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.473
I don't see anything.
I'll drive it up.

51:17.475 --> 51:18.541
Okay.

53:44.454 --> 53:45.788
Dammit!

54:16.653 --> 54:18.587
I don't like this at all.

54:20.724 --> 54:21.991
Whoo!

54:23.827 --> 54:25.427
Come on, man.

54:58.461 --> 55:00.763
Alright!
Time to get out of here!

55:05.468 --> 55:07.870
Stan. Stan!

55:07.872 --> 55:09.405
-What?
-Shhhh.

55:11.808 --> 55:13.876
You okay?
You have a bad dream?

55:13.878 --> 55:16.512
I wasn't dreaming.
I heard something downstairs.

55:19.683 --> 55:21.317
I don't hear anything.

55:21.319 --> 55:22.985
Stan, please go.

55:45.909 --> 55:47.476
Be careful.

56:02.792 --> 56:05.494
That's it. My manuscript
fell on the floor!

56:06.930 --> 56:08.564
Check your office doors.

56:13.837 --> 56:15.738
Locked!

56:28.885 --> 56:30.052
All clear.

56:31.821 --> 56:33.455
How did the book fall over?

56:34.891 --> 56:36.925
Probably too close
to the edge or something.

57:02.018 --> 57:03.986
Oh my God! Finally!

57:03.988 --> 57:05.621
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

57:40.924 --> 57:43.192
Okay, I admit it.
I'm addicted.

57:44.127 --> 57:45.694
Come to papa, baby.

58:12.088 --> 58:13.222
Abby!

58:14.524 --> 58:15.824
It's impossible!

58:16.793 --> 58:18.660
So we've either
been hacked, or...

58:18.662 --> 58:20.128
one of our bank cards
has been scammed.

58:20.130 --> 58:22.164
Honey, did you see
the date and the time?

58:22.166 --> 58:23.732
He was here last night.

58:23.734 --> 58:25.067
He was in our house.
He didn't hack us.

58:25.069 --> 58:26.935
He broke into our house!

58:26.937 --> 58:29.605
-He was here!
-Do you have any idea
how paranoid that sounds?

58:31.241 --> 58:33.942
All the doors were locked.
He's not getting in.

58:33.944 --> 58:36.712
Okay, fine! Do you have
a better explanation then?

58:37.847 --> 58:40.015
Well yeah, as a matter
of fact.

58:40.017 --> 58:42.718
Uh, it's one that you're
not going to like.

58:42.720 --> 58:45.587
But, isn't it possible,
just possible...

58:45.589 --> 58:47.923
that you made
a purchase and just

58:47.925 --> 58:50.259
-don't remember it.
-Seriously? You're saying--

58:50.261 --> 58:51.994
Well you've been under
a lot of stress lately

58:51.996 --> 58:54.029
-and all the medications
you've been taking--
-Two!

58:54.031 --> 58:56.265
-I take two medications!
-We know that Rembatol

58:56.267 --> 58:59.301
makes people sleepwalk
and even drive in their sleep,

58:59.303 --> 59:01.603
and they have no memory
of it afterwards.

59:02.906 --> 59:04.540
And you remember yourself.
Don't you?

59:05.575 --> 59:08.744
It hasn't been
that long.

59:08.746 --> 59:12.180
Yeah. I-I cannot believe
that you're saying this
to me right now.

59:33.937 --> 59:35.938
Stan.

59:42.145 --> 59:43.645
What is it?

59:43.647 --> 59:46.281
What if I am
losing it again?

59:46.283 --> 59:48.917
And wh-what if this
is happening all over again?

59:48.919 --> 59:51.353
I don't remember
doing any of that stuff.
I don't remember--

59:51.355 --> 59:55.657
I hear you.
It's going to be okay.

59:55.659 --> 59:57.159
And I'm sorry about earlier.

59:57.161 --> 59:58.827
I wasn't listening
to how you were feeling.

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:05.601
I think I'm ready
to call Dr. Lieberman
and get that referral.

01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:07.970
Okay.

01:00:07.972 --> 01:00:10.839
And I called the police.
They're sending
a detective over.

01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:12.040
Just in case.

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:18.246
If anything else comes to mind,
please call me.

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:20.849
I would suggest that
you change your locks today

01:00:20.851 --> 01:00:22.985
and get an alarm system
put in as soon as you can.

01:00:22.987 --> 01:00:25.287
Especially since you guys
are somewhat remote here.

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:27.723
It just made it easier
for whoever this was.

01:00:27.725 --> 01:00:29.958
Good. Thank you
for your time.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.860
A pleasure.

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:42.964
Hi. Arthur.
Nice to meet you.

01:01:42.966 --> 01:01:44.399
Would you
excuse us for a second?

01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:46.101
I tried everything, man.

01:01:46.103 --> 01:01:48.136
I was right. The grade
site's fire-walled.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:50.972
I did some research.
There's only two other
computers that have access,

01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:52.340
and they're both
in Castle's office.

01:01:52.342 --> 01:01:54.376
And the only person,
besides him, that has access

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:56.078
to change the grades
is the assistant.

01:01:57.747 --> 01:01:59.147
Then that leaves only
one other option.

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:02.918
I make her change the grade.

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:05.220
I'm out, man.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.756
-I mean it!
-They'll kick you
out for plagiarism.

01:02:07.758 --> 01:02:10.158
That's a lot better
than hard time for assault.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.761
Okay, we'll meet
at your place, talk later.

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:14.863
Hello, professor.

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:19.835
Look, you can play-act innocent

01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:21.737
all you want.
I am not buying it!

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:24.039
I don't know what you mean.

01:02:24.041 --> 01:02:26.108
No, you don't?
You didn't break into my house?

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.143
You didn't hack
into my bank account?

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:32.881
Those are some serious
allegations, professor, I...

01:02:32.883 --> 01:02:36.017
I hope you can back
them up or I might
have to sue for defamation.

01:02:36.019 --> 01:02:37.986
This stops now!

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:39.988
Do you here me?
Or I will make sure

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.023
that you never practice law.

01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:44.426
Are you threatening me?

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:47.496
In front of
all of these witnesses?

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:50.899
Get to class. All of you!

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:57.339
Why don't we just get
to what this is really about?

01:02:57.341 --> 01:02:58.774
You screwed up.

01:02:58.776 --> 01:03:01.109
Nothing you say,
nothing you do,

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:04.246
is going to intimidate me
to change your grade.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.316
Oh yes, you will.

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:10.385
There's no evidence.

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:11.920
Even that cop
you talked to

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:13.288
won't find anything.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:17.392
You change that grade
or your life will be such hell

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:19.361
you will beg for me to stop.

01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:26.501
How dare you!

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:28.203
I assume you have somewhere

01:03:28.205 --> 01:03:29.905
where you should be,
Mr. Van Sickle.

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:32.274
Yes, sir.

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:43.385
Hey, Abby, Abby,
Abby, Abby!

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:46.221
Hey, you alright?

01:03:46.223 --> 01:03:48.390
Yeah. Yeah, I will be.

01:03:48.392 --> 01:03:51.393
I, uh, I have to proctor.

01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:53.028
-Excuse me.
-Well obviously

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:55.363
we have a great
deal to discuss.

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:57.165
Look, Dean--

01:03:57.167 --> 01:04:00.235
Abby, look, I'm a lawyer too.

01:04:00.237 --> 01:04:04.372
And I pass no judgments
until I've heard all the facts.

01:04:04.374 --> 01:04:07.576
Look. Just take a moment.
Catch your breath.

01:04:07.578 --> 01:04:09.911
Come and see me
after your proctor.

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:12.340
Oh God!

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:16.511
-You okay, professor?
-Uh, no. I'm okay. Thank you.

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:44.506
Please
pass out your... tests.

01:05:44.508 --> 01:05:46.441
Don't open them until
the bell rings.

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:50.679
I don't feel good...

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.451
-Oh my God!
-Is she okay?

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.320
Are you okay?

01:05:58.322 --> 01:06:00.288
Oh my God,
Mrs. Grandacre?

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:02.357
-Call 911.
-Call a nurse.

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:12.033
-I-I'm okay.
-I know you're okay, honey.

01:06:12.035 --> 01:06:14.202
But you're going to go
to the hospital anyway.

01:06:14.204 --> 01:06:16.705
I love you, honey.
I'm so sorry.

01:06:16.707 --> 01:06:19.007
Oh please! I love you too.

01:06:19.009 --> 01:06:20.508
I'm going to follow
the ambulance.

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.377
I'll be right there, alright?

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:28.316
-Mr. Grandacre.
-Yeah?

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.051
Is she taking any
other medication?

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:31.519
Uh, yeah. Rembatol.

01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:34.155
That definitely
could be the culprit.

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:35.490
Especially if she
took more than one.

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:38.226
She usually only takes
one, occasionally,

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:39.527
just to help her sleep.

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:40.729
May I?

01:06:40.731 --> 01:06:42.130
Sure.

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:44.132
The pills actually look
exactly alike.

01:06:44.134 --> 01:06:47.202
The only difference between
the two, is Marvan has

01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:49.004
MAR etched on the side.

01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:51.206
But they'll do all the
blood tests at the hospital.

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:52.707
Well, we won't need
to wait for those results.

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:54.509
This is Rembatol, REM.

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:02.217
That's him. He did this.

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:04.786
I'll take these.

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.295
So, it's the same as
the McDeere case.

01:07:14.297 --> 01:07:16.231
Medication switched.

01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:17.599
Well, she's luckier than him.

01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:19.401
She should be out of
the hospital in a few hours.

01:07:19.403 --> 01:07:21.102
I'm going to need a warrant

01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:23.071
for that Van Sickle kid.

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:41.423
I'm going to follow
you for a while, alright?

01:07:41.425 --> 01:07:42.690
Then I'll stop
and get some dinner.

01:07:42.692 --> 01:07:45.160
Okay. Thanks.

01:07:45.162 --> 01:07:46.761
Careful, please.

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.444
Thanks for
picking up dinner, hon.

01:08:02.446 --> 01:08:04.512
Of course.
How are you feeling?

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:05.847
Mmm.

01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:11.619
Oh, that's the locksmith.

01:08:24.466 --> 01:08:25.700
Hello.

01:08:25.702 --> 01:08:27.502
Hello, Abby.

01:08:27.504 --> 01:08:30.471
You're never going to get away
with this, you little bastard.

01:08:30.474 --> 01:08:32.307
Come on, counselor!

01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:34.776
No evidence, no case.
You know that!

01:08:34.778 --> 01:08:37.444
The police can
trace this call.

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:38.712
You honestly think I'd use

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:40.148
my own phone?

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.649
Now look at that.

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:46.421
I see Stan-the-man
is changing the locks.

01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:48.323
Imagine what
a long-range rifle

01:08:48.325 --> 01:08:49.657
could do right about now.

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:52.627
Pow!

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:53.761
Listen to me--

01:08:53.763 --> 01:08:56.264
This is between you and me.

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:58.899
You leave Stan out of this!

01:08:58.902 --> 01:09:00.868
-I didn't hear you say please.
-Please!

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:04.272
Who's in control now, Abby?

01:09:04.274 --> 01:09:05.807
You are.

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:07.475
Sorry. I didn't hear you.

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:08.710
You are!

01:09:08.712 --> 01:09:10.278
Okay, look. I'll--

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:13.648
I'll do whatever you want,
I don't...

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:16.151
You'll do whatever
I want, and then maybe

01:09:16.153 --> 01:09:18.286
I'll consider
leaving you alone.

01:09:22.524 --> 01:09:24.526
I'll change your grade, okay?

01:09:24.528 --> 01:09:25.792
I-I don't even care any more.

01:09:25.795 --> 01:09:28.162
Smart girl!

01:09:28.165 --> 01:09:30.265
Now here's what
you're going to do.

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:32.466
The deadline is midnight.

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:34.368
So you're going to
call Castle right now,

01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:36.604
and tell him I handed
in the paper and got an A.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.274
And an A-minus
for the course.

01:09:40.277 --> 01:09:41.709
You got that?

01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:43.344
No. No, it won't work.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:44.746
He's already
left for the day.

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:48.850
I have an idea.
Meet me at the school, okay?

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:51.920
I can't tell Stan.
After everything

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:55.190
you've done, he will
never let me leave.

01:09:55.192 --> 01:09:57.492
It's-- It's going to have
to be after he's asleep.

01:09:57.494 --> 01:09:59.360
You'd better not
be messing with me.

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:01.896
I told you. I will do it!

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:03.898
Just meet me at 11:15.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.700
What about security?

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:08.436
Uh, security, they see me

01:10:08.438 --> 01:10:10.338
come and go all day long.
It's fine.

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.873
How do I get in there?

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:15.977
I will-- I will leave
the west stairwell open, okay?

01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:18.980
I'll tell them that I need
to bring up stuff from my car.

01:10:18.982 --> 01:10:21.549
You've got yourself a date.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:22.951
Vance?

01:10:22.953 --> 01:10:25.820
When this is done,
I get my life back.

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:31.259
Of course.

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:42.770
Well, apparently we now have
the best locks money can buy.

01:10:44.373 --> 01:10:46.274
Guess we should do
the alarm next, huh?

01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:47.842
I feel safer already.

01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:50.311
I'm not going to feel safe until
that lunatic is behind bars.

01:10:50.313 --> 01:10:53.314
I keep telling you, that's
not going to happen
without any evidence.

01:10:53.316 --> 01:10:55.383
Speaking of which,
was Keyes on the phone?

01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:58.419
-No. It was just my sister.
-Okay, I'm going to call Keyes

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:00.521
because I want the police
to put a car out front.

01:11:00.523 --> 01:11:01.956
-Tonight, if possible.
-No!

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:06.461
You just said that the
locks are good, so what?

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:11.766
Besides, I--
I made a decision.

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:14.535
I think there's an easy
solution to all of this. I...

01:11:15.804 --> 01:11:17.772
I'm going to change
his grade, Stan.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:20.341
I don't care any more,
you know?

01:11:20.343 --> 01:11:21.743
I'm through standing
on principle.

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:25.380
We can't live like this.

01:11:25.382 --> 01:11:27.949
Just promise me you'll do it
over the phone, okay?

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:31.352
Okay.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:47.769
Sorry to disrupt
your dinner.

01:11:47.771 --> 01:11:49.604
I'm looking for
Vance Van Sickle.

01:11:49.606 --> 01:11:50.972
So are we.

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:52.840
Haven't seen him in
a couple of days.

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:56.911
Have any idea
where he might be?

01:11:56.913 --> 01:11:59.047
He's always gone for
long stretches at a time.

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:01.449
May I?

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:04.485
I have a warrant to
search the premises.

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:05.720
Can you show
me his room?

01:12:05.722 --> 01:12:08.356
Yes.
It's that way.

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:33.781
Where was this taken?

01:12:33.783 --> 01:12:35.049
That's where
his father lived.

01:12:35.051 --> 01:12:37.585
No one's lived there
since he died.

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:41.089
I'm going to need
that address.

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:47.462
Vance Van Sickle!

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:10.418
Gun missing from a lock up here.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.954
Clear over here!

01:13:13.922 --> 01:13:15.089
Be thorough.

01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:16.491
He's smart.

01:13:16.493 --> 01:13:18.025
He knows the law.

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:53.027
Hey. Bag this.

01:14:42.744 --> 01:14:43.978
Abby?

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:46.781
Dammit!

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:03.164
- Keyes?
- Mr. Grandacre,

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:04.765
I need to speak to Abigail.

01:15:11.608 --> 01:15:13.074
Professor?

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:18.913
Yes, Joe?

01:15:18.915 --> 01:15:21.516
I unlocked the records
office, so you're all set.

01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:22.817
I'm off doing my rounds,

01:15:22.819 --> 01:15:24.952
so just lock up the front
doors after yourself.

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:29.891
You bet. Thanks.

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:50.077
4, 3, 2... 2, 3, 4.

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.698
You started without me.

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:13.868
I was just setting up.
You're early.

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:17.838
Dying to know
how you got my key.

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:22.944
No dying until you
change my grade.

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:26.180
Seriously,
how did you get it?

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:28.883
You type in "How to
make a copy of a key,"

01:16:28.885 --> 01:16:31.919
on the interwebs.

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:34.088
You were pretty clever
about switching out my pills.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.356
Ah, the resemblance

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:36.824
was just dumb luck.

01:16:37.893 --> 01:16:39.961
All simple.

01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:42.063
Is that what
you did to McDeere?

01:16:42.065 --> 01:16:44.932
Because he gave
you a B-minus?

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.169
Now if I told you
that was the case,

01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:51.205
that would be a bit
self-incriminating,
wouldn't it?

01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:04.018
Vance...

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:06.687
I'm ready.

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:09.156
Good.

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:11.959
What if I had died?

01:17:13.228 --> 01:17:15.329
I wouldn't be able
to change your grade.

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:19.033
I saw you only took
two at a time.

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:21.869
Two Rembatol will mess you up,
but it won't kill you.

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:24.105
Calculated risk.

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:31.212
Uh-huh!

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:33.848
Allow me.

01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:45.926
Now that wasn't
so painful, was it?

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:57.672
Vance.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.128
This is Abigail Grandacre.
Please leave a message.

01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:04.805
Abigail!

01:19:06.341 --> 01:19:07.508
Abigail!

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:10.478
Abigail!

01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:34.802
Abigail!

01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:40.040
Joe!

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:43.010
Joe! Joe!

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:48.115
Dammit!

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:49.784
Abigail!

01:20:22.417 --> 01:20:24.819
- Dispatch.
- 4th Street Division?

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:26.086
There's a gunman on campus.

01:20:26.088 --> 01:20:28.088
Okay, backup is on its way.

01:20:38.067 --> 01:20:40.134
Okay. I'm almost there.
Send backup.

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:43.971
Security from
the university just called.

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.473
Listen to me.

01:22:26.475 --> 01:22:28.475
You stay in this car!

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:01.575
Security says they're in
the administration building

01:23:01.577 --> 01:23:03.310
and Van Sickle's got a gun.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.447
You two go that way.

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:11.051
You stay three steps
behind me, you hear?

01:23:11.053 --> 01:23:12.586
-Okay.
-Let's go.

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:25.733
Hold it right there, son.

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:28.135
Drop it!

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:31.705
Okay.

01:23:31.707 --> 01:23:33.107
Yes, sir.

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:38.245
Now, kick it over.

01:23:58.099 --> 01:24:00.701
Aah! No!

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.274
Sounds like it's
coming from the gym.

01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:59.626
Day of reckoning, Abby!

01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:03.764
Time to meet your
judge and jury!

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:07.267
Or should I say,
executioner.

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.212
Aah!

01:26:38.893 --> 01:26:40.294
Back!

01:26:57.612 --> 01:26:59.846
Hon, are you hurt?
You okay?

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:02.449
Oh honey!

01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:06.253
Are you okay?

01:27:08.323 --> 01:27:09.957
Am I under arrest?

01:27:09.959 --> 01:27:13.860
No, Abigail,
you are the victim here.

01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:19.399
It's over. It's over.

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:28.742
It's okay.
It's all over. It's all over.

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:32.412
It's over, honey, it's over.

01:27:44.325 --> 01:27:46.493
Here you go, Abigail.

01:27:46.495 --> 01:27:48.028
Well deserved!

01:27:49.831 --> 01:27:52.299
The board
unanimously decided

01:27:52.301 --> 01:27:54.935
that we could all use
lessons in ethics.

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:02.876
Thank you, sir.

01:28:02.878 --> 01:28:05.279
Thank you.

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:12.819
You are probably
wondering why I wrote
all the question marks.

01:28:12.821 --> 01:28:15.589
Well, this quote from
Jacob Bronowski

01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:17.824
offers an explanation.

01:28:17.826 --> 01:28:20.594
"The values, by which
we are to survive, are not

01:28:20.596 --> 01:28:23.730
"rules for just
and unjust conduct,

01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:27.000
"but are those deeper
illuminations, in whose light,

01:28:27.002 --> 01:28:29.870
"justice and injustice,
good and evil

01:28:29.872 --> 01:28:31.538
"means and ends

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:34.941
are seen in fearful
sharpness of outline."

01:28:34.943 --> 01:28:38.612
So, I have posted
your first assignment

01:28:38.614 --> 01:28:40.881
on the computer
blackboard, which is

01:28:40.883 --> 01:28:42.749
"To find and explain

01:28:42.751 --> 01:28:45.485
ten definitions to
the word 'ethics'"

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:49.456
and evaluate each definition
to the following yardstick:

01:28:49.458 --> 01:28:51.391
Are ethics or
codes of conduct

01:28:51.393 --> 01:28:54.828
merely external sets
of rules to be
blindly followed?

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:57.597
Or, do they rather
originate in the light of

01:28:57.599 --> 01:28:58.965
an inner illumination,

01:28:58.967 --> 01:29:01.868
viewed through a lens
of a greater morality?

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:06.840
I have often
had to ask myself

01:29:06.842 --> 01:29:08.375
the same question.

01:29:08.377 --> 01:29:10.977
I, uh, have made
the mistake

01:29:10.979 --> 01:29:13.647
and it cost
an innocent life.

01:29:13.649 --> 01:29:15.649
That's something that
I have to live with.

01:29:15.651 --> 01:29:18.719
And I would like to save
you all from making the

01:29:18.721 --> 01:29:20.020
same mistake.

01:29:20.022 --> 01:29:22.456
So, any questions?

01:29:24.459 --> 01:29:25.892
I do, professor.
