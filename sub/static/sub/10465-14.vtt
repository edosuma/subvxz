Justin, hey. 

09:38.801 --> 09:40.534
Could I, uh, talk to you?

09:40.534 --> 09:42.634
Um, sure.

Uh, this is Sam, by the way.

09:51.801 --> 09:53.200
I'll just be a sec.

Hear what?

10:07.934 --> 10:10.234
Robin told me.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.434
Uh, Gail called her.

No. She is, Julia.

10:44.067 --> 10:45.400
I didn't sleep
at all last night.

I said all those horrible things
about her.

10:50.100 --> 10:51.367
I mean, about Harvard and--

10:51.367 --> 10:54.000
That didn't mean anything.

Let's just talk. Okay?

11:06.367 --> 11:09.000
About Libby
and what happened

11:09.000 --> 11:11.167
and how you feel.

11:11.167 --> 11:13.834
It's a terrible loss
for all of us.

11:13.834 --> 11:16.334
She left me a message

11:16.334 --> 11:18.367
over Christmas break.

11:18.367 --> 11:19.334

She left one for me too.

No.

It's horrible.

I don't know how somebody
can do that.

that you pretty much hated me.

It always felt like everything

15:45.234 --> 15:47.801
was life and death
in high school.

15:47.801 --> 15:49.234
You failed an exam,

found a new best friend,

15:52.067 --> 15:54.234

15:54.234 --> 15:56.534

of that minivan

16:26.501 --> 16:29.200

16:29.200 --> 16:32.200
So now, I can go out drinking
with you? Is that the idea?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.934
Well, it's so we
can hang out together

16:34.934 --> 16:36.167

out partying with you tonight.

16:44.033 --> 16:47.000
No. No. I understand.
Maybe tomorrow.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.968
So is there-- Is there a card
with this or anything?

16:50.968 --> 16:52.868
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

17:05.666 --> 17:06.601

17:08.000 --> 17:09.032
Nothing.

just say it.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.133
That's all you wanted to say?

17:19.233 --> 17:20.601
It's a birthday card.

17:20.601 --> 17:22.300
Sarah, I wrote "happy birthday."

17:22.300 --> 17:23.400
Right. Right.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.267

the word love too.

17:25.267 --> 17:27.000

Oh, that's so romantic

17:27.000 --> 17:28.567
and very heartfelt. God.

how long did that take you?

17:31.734 --> 17:33.534

Maybe it's that I--

to tell me something?

I'm trying to tell you?

17:59.200 --> 18:01.100
Just so you know

18:01.100 --> 18:03.100
it is not that easy
to get a good fake ID,

18:03.100 --> 18:04.701
and that is a really good one.

18:04.701 --> 18:05.667
It took me a whole week.

18:07.601 --> 18:10.234
I spent two hours trying to find
exactly the right card for you.

18:10.234 --> 18:11.801
I went three different places.

18:11.801 --> 18:12.968
Is that enough time for you?

18:12.968 --> 18:14.133
Is that not enough?

18:16.067 --> 18:17.667
Well?

18:19.467 --> 18:21.367
Yeah, it's enough time.

18:38.601 --> 18:40.133
I can't focus.

18:40.133 --> 18:41.501
It's okay. No problem.

for Northwestern.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.901

18:49.901 --> 18:51.934
do you think that
she knew she was gonna do it?

18:51.934 --> 18:55.400
I don't know. Uh...

18:55.400 --> 18:57.767
You know what? I really have
to finish my applications.

18:57.767 --> 18:59.167

19:03.968 --> 19:05.667

19:13.334 --> 19:15.367
I mean,
I don't know how. Somehow.

19:15.367 --> 19:17.501
And getting there in time

19:17.501 --> 19:19.000
and stopping the engine.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.334
And pulling her out of the car.

19:20.334 --> 19:21.701
Yeah. I thought about that too.

19:21.701 --> 19:23.000
By how were we supposed to know?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.901
I mean, it's not like
she said something to me

19:24.901 --> 19:26.534
or to you that would--
Why would she?

19:26.534 --> 19:29.534
I dumped her, and you stopped
being her friend.

19:29.534 --> 19:31.801
She stopped being my friend.

19:31.801 --> 19:34.667
Well, she didn't have
another boyfriend

after me, right?

19:36.167 --> 19:37.868
I don't know.

19:37.868 --> 19:40.000
Maybe that's why she
was so unhappy or--

19:40.000 --> 19:41.734
 Uh-uh.

19:41.734 --> 19:44.968
No. It-- It--
It's not our fault.

19:44.968 --> 19:46.300
That's just--

No.

19:48.567 --> 19:50.000
No.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.133
Okay. Fine. Then why?

in front of her.
