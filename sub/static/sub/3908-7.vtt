02:15.043 --> 02:17.004
_

02:19.923 --> 02:22.759
( breathing heavily )

02:28.098 --> 02:30.434
I feel so fucked up.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.603
My head's so fucked up.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.106
You want me to roll a joint?

02:36.190 --> 02:38.775
<i>Oh, those fucking fucks.</i>

02:40.194 --> 02:42.195
Holloway was there.

02:42.196 --> 02:44.114
Fucking Geldof.

02:44.198 --> 02:47.201
The fucking AG was shaking
hands with the...

02:50.704 --> 02:53.290
That piece of shit
tried to choke me out.

02:56.293 --> 02:58.795
( exhales )

02:59.963 --> 03:02.382
He put his hands
on the wrong...

03:07.721 --> 03:10.307
I've been waiting
my whole life for that.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.314
I think I even...

03:19.149 --> 03:21.235
went looking.

03:23.153 --> 03:25.405
That's my whole life.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.869
And when I ran out of the
woods and they found me...

03:31.536 --> 03:32.871
The woods?

03:33.246 --> 03:35.082
What?

03:36.917 --> 03:39.086
What?

03:40.420 --> 03:42.047
You said...

03:42.089 --> 03:44.424
( sniffles )
Oh, God.

04:11.284 --> 04:13.787
Hey, look, I don't think...

04:16.373 --> 04:19.959
This wouldn't help you.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.962
It might.

04:23.547 --> 04:25.799
It usually does.

04:28.635 --> 04:30.303
All right.

04:32.889 --> 04:35.475
( groans, laughs )

04:36.810 --> 04:40.563
<i>Oh, it's the drugs.</i>
It's the drugs.

04:40.564 --> 04:42.314
I'm fucked up.

04:42.315 --> 04:44.359
Mmm.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.571
You're too far out
of my league anyway.

04:51.241 --> 04:53.452
I'm gonna check out
the other two.

04:55.078 --> 04:58.415
You and the girl, you should
stay here through tomorrow.

04:58.457 --> 05:01.543
You know, we can see
what the damage is

05:01.585 --> 05:03.503
and report all this to Davis.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.922
Yeah.

05:07.299 --> 05:09.384
You can call your sister.

05:10.927 --> 05:12.679
( exhales )

05:14.347 --> 05:17.098
Addenda to corporate charters
for holding companies,

05:17.099 --> 05:20.103
shares dispersed to new owners--
Eagle Iron LLC.

05:20.145 --> 05:24.190
President Osip Agranov.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.859
Electralux Entertainment.

05:25.860 --> 05:29.779
President Anthony Chessani.

05:33.658 --> 05:36.453
It shows the holding
company's assets.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.793
These are all land parcels
in that corridor.

05:44.794 --> 05:47.047
Valley poisoned by mine runoff.

05:50.967 --> 05:54.428
There was some kind of
buy/sell deal upon death.

05:54.429 --> 05:57.305
I mean, they just repurchased
Caspere's shares for pennies

05:57.306 --> 05:58.475
and redistributed them.

05:58.516 --> 06:00.142
Motive.

06:00.143 --> 06:01.478
Well, it's something.

06:01.519 --> 06:03.480
<i>( phone buzzes )</i>

06:07.901 --> 06:09.819
( clears throat )

06:13.907 --> 06:17.619
_

06:22.249 --> 06:24.042
Everything all right?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.001
( clears throat )

06:25.043 --> 06:27.337
Yeah. Yeah.

06:28.588 --> 06:30.548
It's just my fiancée.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.509
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

06:48.108 --> 06:49.858
Okay, what's next?

06:49.859 --> 06:52.695
I got to, uh--

06:52.696 --> 06:54.614
I got to check in at home.

07:02.372 --> 07:03.707
<i>( door closes )</i>

07:09.963 --> 07:12.381
We should drop this on Davis.

07:12.382 --> 07:15.467
<i>You want to hold the fort?</i>

07:15.468 --> 07:17.470
Question her when she comes up.

07:18.388 --> 07:20.140
Yeah.

07:23.476 --> 07:27.397
You think they could make me
for that security guard?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.400
Would they?

07:31.735 --> 07:33.570
I don't know.

07:57.093 --> 07:59.262
I hoped you'd make it home.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.724
But I guess here
is good enough.

08:02.766 --> 08:05.560
Took a couple kicks last night.

08:05.602 --> 08:07.562
Can you talk about it?

08:07.604 --> 08:10.565
There'll be some new people
operating at the clubs

08:10.566 --> 08:12.858
for a while, a few days a week.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.819
What people?

08:14.861 --> 08:18.156
Mexicans.
Something else to solve.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.823
In the midst of being
gangbanged by forces unseen,

08:20.824 --> 08:22.575
I figure I'd drill
a new orifice,

08:22.576 --> 08:24.871
go on and fuck myself
for a change.

08:26.289 --> 08:28.664
Frank, what can you
pull together?

08:28.665 --> 08:29.709
Liquid right now?

08:29.710 --> 08:33.129
Maybe 200K.
Three tops.

08:35.381 --> 08:37.884
We could just walk away
from the table.

08:37.885 --> 08:41.429
That's 45 years of my life.

08:41.471 --> 08:43.472
You see me managing
an Applebee's?

08:43.474 --> 08:46.267
I worked at one once.

08:46.309 --> 08:48.561
They give you a shift meal.

08:49.646 --> 08:51.314
( chuckles )

08:55.401 --> 08:57.737
I'll handle
the deliveries at Lux.

09:00.823 --> 09:03.159
Mrs. Semyon.
You look lovely this morning.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.828
Ray, dashing as ever.

09:07.497 --> 09:09.290
Keep it holstered.

09:20.510 --> 09:22.971
<i>( cards shuffling )</i>

09:26.140 --> 09:29.352
Aw. A little bit of
a strange night.

09:34.148 --> 09:36.442
Emily: <i>You should just tell
me what's going on, Paul.</i>

09:36.484 --> 09:39.111
The men on the phone scared me.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.947
He said, "Ask Paul
about the pictures."

09:41.948 --> 09:43.283
That's all he said.

09:43.324 --> 09:46.118
He hung up.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.453
What is this about?

09:47.495 --> 09:49.955
<i>Tell me or I'm not going.</i>

09:49.956 --> 09:53.625
It was that case.
I was undercover.

09:53.626 --> 09:56.296
I just want you to be safe
for a couple days.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.717
We are having a baby.

10:02.051 --> 10:04.470
This will all
be cleared up by then.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.473
Why did you get with me, Paul?

10:08.474 --> 10:10.977
Why did you even ask me out?

10:16.232 --> 10:19.068
I'm just trying
to be a good man.

10:21.237 --> 10:23.740
Well, you don't try right.

10:30.371 --> 10:34.291
Athena:
<i>What happened?</i>

10:34.292 --> 10:36.711
It was bad in there.

10:38.129 --> 10:39.963
If they think I was you,

10:39.964 --> 10:43.009
you need to disappear
for a little while.

10:44.260 --> 10:45.635
What?

10:45.636 --> 10:47.971
How am I supposed to disappear?

10:47.972 --> 10:49.807
I'll give you some money.

10:51.309 --> 10:53.935
Go up north.
Oregon, maybe.

10:53.936 --> 10:55.812
Dad knows some people.

10:55.813 --> 10:58.065
He should go,
too, just--

10:58.066 --> 10:59.399
just to be safe.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.067
For how long?

11:01.068 --> 11:02.778
I-- I'm seeing someone

11:02.779 --> 11:05.322
and I'm starting
school in the fall.

11:05.323 --> 11:07.991
We just need
to put this case down.

11:07.992 --> 11:10.410
And then you're okay.

11:10.411 --> 11:13.038
But you gotta go.
Both of you.

11:13.039 --> 11:15.207
Now, like today.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.002
You get somebody to put some of
your things together for you.

11:18.003 --> 11:21.004
You don't go back home.

11:21.005 --> 11:23.507
What did you do?

11:23.508 --> 11:25.551
I saved a girl.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.472
She's in the next room

11:30.473 --> 11:33.850
coming off of whatever
they had her on.

11:33.851 --> 11:35.728
Did they give you something?

11:40.608 --> 11:43.777
Did you go all the way in?

11:43.778 --> 11:45.613
Inside the party?

11:46.572 --> 11:48.032
Yeah.

11:50.576 --> 11:51.786
Did you?

12:13.057 --> 12:16.476
I don't see how you can
expect us to stay here.

12:16.477 --> 12:19.186
Emily: <i>Paul, if something
this wrong is going on,</i>

12:19.187 --> 12:20.521
<i>maybe you should go</i>
<i>to your bosses.</i>

12:20.522 --> 12:21.897
Tell them you need out.

12:21.898 --> 12:23.691
It's more complicated
than that.

12:23.692 --> 12:25.570
The less you know, the better.

12:25.571 --> 12:28.405
I can't go to the bosses,
not yet.

12:28.406 --> 12:31.158
This op I did,
it might be nothing.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.827
But I just want
you both to be safe

12:34.828 --> 12:37.081
if my cover was blown,
that's it.

12:37.082 --> 12:38.790
Two, three nights tops.

12:38.791 --> 12:41.584
And what are we supposed to do?

12:41.585 --> 12:43.753
Room service.

12:43.754 --> 12:49.718
Don't answer the door
or the phone if it isn't me.

12:49.719 --> 12:53.764
And, you know, just relax.

12:58.144 --> 12:59.395
Okay.

13:08.070 --> 13:10.363
You bring someone up,

13:10.364 --> 13:13.658
invest time and emotion,

13:13.659 --> 13:15.618
personal attachment,

13:15.619 --> 13:18.747
and hope for what?

13:18.748 --> 13:20.040
Parity.

13:20.041 --> 13:21.999
Well, this is
way bigger than Blake.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.834
You got probable
future governor

13:23.835 --> 13:26.253
and current Attorney
General Geldof there.

13:26.254 --> 13:28.380
And that guy from Catalast,
McCandless,

13:28.381 --> 13:30.466
- he closed the deal.
- What deal?

13:30.467 --> 13:33.427
We got these documents from one
of Catalast's holding companies,

13:33.428 --> 13:36.472
transferred ownership of assets,
land in that rail corridor.

13:36.473 --> 13:38.766
Now, they sold Caspere's shares
in two other companies.

13:38.767 --> 13:42.063
One of them's owned by the mayor's kid,
Tony Chessani.

13:42.064 --> 13:44.440
Him?
Kid's a twist.

13:44.482 --> 13:47.232
I fixed a hit and run
for him once-- motherfucker.

13:47.233 --> 13:49.612
Well, the other company's
owned by this older cat.

13:49.613 --> 13:51.321
He was at the party.

13:51.322 --> 13:54.658
I saw him at the warehouse
where they dropped the girls last week.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.952
Looked European.

13:56.994 --> 14:00.330
Papers said his name was...

14:00.331 --> 14:03.667
Osip Agranov.

14:05.961 --> 14:08.129
He's Russian Israeli.

14:08.130 --> 14:10.633
Blake was listed
as the holding company's treasurer.

14:10.634 --> 14:13.802
So to me, it looked like
your man helped Tony

14:13.803 --> 14:16.472
and this other guy
fuck you out of Caspere's shares.

14:16.473 --> 14:19.891
It could be they killed
Caspere for them.

14:19.892 --> 14:23.019
My old chief Holloway,
he was there, too.

14:23.020 --> 14:27.232
The girl, Irina Rulfo,

14:27.233 --> 14:30.027
she's had a cop gave her
Caspere's stash.

14:30.028 --> 14:32.529
Paid her to pawn it.

14:32.530 --> 14:33.823
She said he was white.

14:33.824 --> 14:35.490
You found Irina?

14:35.491 --> 14:37.493
Sort of.

14:39.036 --> 14:41.330
She's gone.

14:48.546 --> 14:51.214
You got a name for me?

14:51.215 --> 14:53.592
The man who put you on
my wife's attacker?

14:55.261 --> 14:58.638
I'll have it for you
by the end of the day.

14:58.639 --> 15:00.557
Word of honor.

15:00.558 --> 15:04.144
I guess I'll continue
with the belief it wasn't you.

15:05.521 --> 15:08.231
Uh-huh.

15:08.232 --> 15:10.775
Ray...

15:10.776 --> 15:13.611
go ahead and show
yourself out just now.

15:13.612 --> 15:16.239
I need a few minutes alone,

15:16.240 --> 15:18.992
process the ins
and outs of all this.

15:18.993 --> 15:21.035
Sure.

15:21.036 --> 15:22.955
I gotta go anyways.

15:36.218 --> 15:37.802
Woodrugh, Velcoro.

15:37.803 --> 15:41.054
The Rulfo girl said a policeman paid her
to pawn Caspere's stuff.

15:41.055 --> 15:43.640
Look in LAPD service records,
all right.

15:43.641 --> 15:45.436
Find out where
Holloway was in '92

15:45.437 --> 15:47.604
and who else was in his squad.

15:47.605 --> 15:49.146
Davis is meeting me
this afternoon.

15:49.147 --> 15:51.775
I want her to see
those signatures in person.

15:51.776 --> 15:54.402
Ani: <i>Your sister
put me onto you.</i>

15:54.403 --> 15:56.363
Said you were missing.

15:56.405 --> 15:58.407
( scoffs )

15:59.742 --> 16:03.787
And then this
was delivered to her.

16:03.829 --> 16:06.457
Contents of a mailbox you kept.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.500
I need you to look
at this stuff.

16:09.501 --> 16:11.503
These pictures.

16:17.926 --> 16:20.304
Oh, shit, man.

16:20.346 --> 16:22.348
Forgot I kept that box.

16:24.516 --> 16:26.601
Right.

16:26.602 --> 16:29.396
Yeah, Tascha
must have sent these.

16:29.438 --> 16:30.981
Tascha?

16:31.023 --> 16:32.523
You know Ben Caspere?

16:32.524 --> 16:35.277
He had a girl
he introduced as Tascha.

16:37.446 --> 16:39.823
Yeah.

16:39.865 --> 16:44.411
I met Ben at
the Panticapaem Institute

16:44.453 --> 16:46.497
when I was a maid.

16:46.538 --> 16:47.831
He was the one.

16:47.873 --> 16:51.668
He hooked me up on the circuit.

16:51.710 --> 16:56.090
Tascha-- God--
was his, like, favorite.

16:56.131 --> 16:58.092
She's Hungarian.

16:58.133 --> 17:01.219
( scoffs )
But she had these plans.

17:01.220 --> 17:05.098
<i>Photos of these parties.</i>
<i>I warned her.</i>

17:05.140 --> 17:07.935
Fuck, maybe she sent
these as backup.

17:07.976 --> 17:11.394
( scoffs )
Bitch tried to involve me in that shit.

17:11.395 --> 17:13.065
She tried to blackmail them.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.275
I warned her.

17:15.317 --> 17:16.819
Dudes like this don't play.

17:16.819 --> 17:19.487
All right, what about
these diamonds?

17:19.488 --> 17:21.365
They mean anything to you?

17:21.406 --> 17:23.156
Those must be--

17:23.157 --> 17:27.829
Yeah, she had said once
that Caspere had shown her these diamonds.

17:27.871 --> 17:30.581
Said they were special like.

17:30.582 --> 17:32.084
What happened to Tascha?

17:36.338 --> 17:40.676
Wherever we were,
it was someplace up north.

17:42.928 --> 17:45.263
They found a camera.

17:45.264 --> 17:48.391
So I think there was a cabin

17:48.392 --> 17:50.561
out back.

17:50.602 --> 17:53.814
It was Tony C and their guys.

17:53.856 --> 17:55.691
<i>They took her into the woods.</i>

17:55.732 --> 17:58.569
- Will you testify?
- Fuck, no.

17:59.736 --> 18:01.738
I was hammered anyway.

18:01.780 --> 18:04.531
You know what? Thinking about it,
I don't know what I've seen.

18:04.532 --> 18:06.368
Is that when you
tried to get out?

18:06.369 --> 18:09.538
I never tried to get out.

18:10.789 --> 18:12.206
Girl fucked up.

18:12.207 --> 18:14.543
All you gotta do
is follow the rules.

18:14.585 --> 18:16.336
I didn't want to get out.

18:16.378 --> 18:18.045
You feel me?

18:18.046 --> 18:20.632
I was never missing.

18:21.758 --> 18:23.218
You didn't look
like you wanted to be

18:23.219 --> 18:25.470
where you were
when I found you.

18:25.512 --> 18:28.765
I took too much Molly
on top of champagne.

18:28.807 --> 18:35.105
So what?
It happens.

18:35.147 --> 18:37.149
All right, so...

18:39.401 --> 18:40.985
who's the other girl?

18:40.986 --> 18:42.778
Her name is Laura, maybe.

18:42.779 --> 18:45.238
I ain't seen her
in like five, six months.

18:45.239 --> 18:47.200
Maybe they took her
out to the cabin?

18:47.201 --> 18:50.745
No, she wasn't dumb
like Tascha.

18:50.746 --> 18:53.165
Look, can I just get a ride?

18:53.206 --> 18:55.082
Or call somebody?

18:55.083 --> 18:56.918
Your sister's on her way.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.962
What the fuck?

18:59.963 --> 19:01.880
You don't think
my sister's fucked up?

19:01.881 --> 19:05.550
The way she waits hand and foot on that
panty-sniffing motherfucker?

19:05.551 --> 19:07.137
Better than being strung out.

19:07.138 --> 19:10.098
Yo, I have a place.

19:10.140 --> 19:12.059
I got nice things.

19:12.100 --> 19:15.770
I had a good thing
with Tony and his people.

19:15.771 --> 19:17.979
Maybe-- and this
is just a thought,

19:17.980 --> 19:21.276
maybe you were put on Earth
for more than fucking.

19:23.362 --> 19:25.906
Everything is fucking.

19:30.285 --> 19:31.912
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

19:46.051 --> 19:48.470
( crying )
Oh, thank God.

19:50.305 --> 19:53.140
No, stop.
I am not going with you.

19:53.141 --> 19:55.016
Fuck your <i>pervertido</i> husband.

19:55.017 --> 19:58.144
- He's different now.
- You need to lay low, Vera.

19:58.145 --> 20:01.481
Stay with your sister.
I'll let you know when it's safe.

20:01.482 --> 20:03.068
Till then, you're in danger.

20:03.110 --> 20:06.279
You fucking <i> putas.</i>
You put me in danger.

20:06.321 --> 20:08.822
And I'm the only one
who can get you out.

20:08.823 --> 20:12.242
You reach out to those men,
I'll let them know you talked to a cop

20:12.243 --> 20:14.329
and they'll paint
a cabin with you.

20:25.674 --> 20:27.717
_

20:27.759 --> 20:30.303
You motherfuckers.

20:39.938 --> 20:42.524
<i>( keyboard clicking )</i>

20:42.899 --> 20:45.318
_

20:45.402 --> 20:47.279
Holy fuck.

20:48.446 --> 20:50.699
_

20:51.783 --> 20:53.868
_

20:53.869 --> 20:55.537
Shit.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.840
Late today.

21:06.882 --> 21:08.466
Had to get Ivar
covering the pit.

21:08.508 --> 21:12.345
Sorry, boss.
I was taking care of some stuff.

21:12.387 --> 21:15.891
The girls had a
little private thing last night.

21:17.142 --> 21:19.269
15 Gs.

21:19.311 --> 21:21.395
- Yours.
- Holy cow.

21:21.396 --> 21:24.815
You must be what they call
a natural-born pimp.

21:24.816 --> 21:29.112
Me, I always saw a difference between
a whore and a pimp.

21:29.154 --> 21:32.991
A whore can still
have integrity.

21:34.075 --> 21:36.494
You want to move me up,
let me know.

21:36.495 --> 21:38.830
That's the thing, right?

21:40.040 --> 21:41.917
There's nothing
to move you up to.

21:41.958 --> 21:45.085
- ( liquid pouring )
- Is there?

21:45.086 --> 21:49.925
I mean, all my shit's been
taken down to the street.

21:52.677 --> 21:54.596
You'll get it back, boss.

21:54.638 --> 21:57.432
Everybody knows you will.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.185
Stan was following you.

22:01.186 --> 22:03.271
And he wasn't
the subtlest guy in the world,

22:03.272 --> 22:06.441
so I'm guessing that
you spotted the tail.

22:06.483 --> 22:09.319
Hey, look, boss,
I don't know--

22:09.361 --> 22:11.779
What did he see you doing

22:11.780 --> 22:14.991
caused you to punch
his ticket like that?

22:15.033 --> 22:19.286
You took his eyes.
Why?

22:19.287 --> 22:21.331
To make it look
connected to Caspere?

22:23.541 --> 22:26.086
Truth is your only
play right now,

22:26.127 --> 22:28.629
because you fucked up

22:28.630 --> 22:31.298
letting yourself be alone

22:31.299 --> 22:33.967
in this room with me.

22:33.968 --> 22:37.764
Look, Frank, there's been
a mistake somewhere.

22:37.806 --> 22:39.849
You're arrogant.

22:39.891 --> 22:42.143
Or else you never would
have walked in here.

23:18.430 --> 23:21.015
Have I got a fucking
story for you.

23:23.268 --> 23:25.270
Hell.

23:27.772 --> 23:29.357
( engine starts )

23:39.701 --> 23:41.703
( panting )

23:46.291 --> 23:49.209
Please-- ah!
( crunches )

23:49.210 --> 23:51.671
Please.
Frank, please.

23:51.713 --> 23:53.881
- I can--
- You can what?

23:53.882 --> 23:56.843
Talk? Osip?

23:56.885 --> 23:58.511
His crew?

23:58.553 --> 24:01.305
Caspere? Stan?

24:01.306 --> 24:04.348
Osip's people,
they've been running Eastern Bloc girls

24:04.349 --> 24:07.351
through Southern California
for over a year, Frank.

24:07.352 --> 24:09.395
Osip's been moving
to take your spot

24:09.396 --> 24:11.316
ever since
your meeting in Paris.

24:11.317 --> 24:14.360
- With your help, huh?
- ( groans )

24:14.402 --> 24:15.945
They reached out.

24:15.987 --> 24:19.238
All these moves you were making,
you'd have done the same.

24:19.239 --> 24:21.991
You think they give a shit
about handshakes?

24:21.992 --> 24:24.746
You never should have
brought this to Osip.

24:27.415 --> 24:29.083
- ( squishing )
- ( groans )

24:29.084 --> 24:32.420
Fuck.
( groaning )

24:35.590 --> 24:37.841
( choking )

24:37.842 --> 24:40.470
You kill Caspere?
Or did Osip?

24:40.511 --> 24:43.387
No, no. Nobody knows
who that was, man. Nobody.

24:43.388 --> 24:44.889
So where's the money
I gave him?

24:44.890 --> 24:47.558
Caspere was always
gonna fuck you, Frank.

24:47.559 --> 24:49.187
Osip was backing the play.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.271
Osip and Tony Chessani,

24:51.272 --> 24:54.608
they're absorbing
Caspere's action?

24:54.609 --> 24:57.985
- Why'd you kill Stan?
- He saw me meeting Osip and his guy.

24:57.986 --> 25:00.949
He wanted a payoff, Frank.
He tried blackmailing me.

25:00.950 --> 25:04.243
- Bullshit.
- What the fuck? It's bullshit.

25:04.285 --> 25:06.452
You got all these
big plans, land deals.

25:06.453 --> 25:08.873
Where was that supposed
to leave us?

25:08.874 --> 25:12.502
You taught me, "Make
your own opportunities."

25:12.543 --> 25:16.463
That guy way back,
Velcoro's wife,

25:16.464 --> 25:18.299
who was that guy you gave up?

25:18.300 --> 25:20.801
What? Velcoro?
Frank, what--

25:20.802 --> 25:24.847
He didn't hurt Ray's wife.
Who was he?

25:24.889 --> 25:27.100
This fucking meth head.

25:27.141 --> 25:30.852
He said I ripped him off.
He was gonna come after me.

25:30.853 --> 25:33.147
I heard about
this deputy's wife.

25:33.148 --> 25:35.649
I saw a chance
to step up for you,

25:35.650 --> 25:37.901
get noticed.

25:37.902 --> 25:40.070
Look me in the eyes.

25:40.071 --> 25:41.906
I want to watch
your lights go out.

25:41.948 --> 25:44.492
( gasping, choking )

25:46.744 --> 25:50.498
I can get money back.
I know where there's money.

25:57.422 --> 25:59.756
Osip and Catalast,

25:59.757 --> 26:02.009
there's a big cash exchange
tomorrow night up in Ojai.

26:02.010 --> 26:04.678
McCandless's place.
Crystal Ranch.

26:04.679 --> 26:08.433
Osip's turning over 12 million
for Caspere's shares.

26:08.474 --> 26:10.016
12 million, Frank.

26:10.017 --> 26:11.561
Who's gonna be there?

26:11.602 --> 26:13.353
I don't know for sure.

26:13.354 --> 26:16.983
It's a handoff.
Security.

26:17.024 --> 26:19.527
Osip, he'll be there.

26:22.363 --> 26:25.700
All right.
Get yourself together.

26:27.869 --> 26:29.619
( crying )

26:29.620 --> 26:32.038
Anything else you can tell me?

26:32.039 --> 26:33.624
Anything?

26:35.209 --> 26:37.044
Might help.

26:46.971 --> 26:49.723
They're taking it all, Frank.

26:49.724 --> 26:52.893
Osip's people bought
the liens on the clubs.

26:52.894 --> 26:54.477
My people won't
go along with that.

26:54.478 --> 26:56.647
You don't have any people, Frank,
that's what I'm saying.

26:56.689 --> 26:59.525
Nails, they never
approached him.

26:59.567 --> 27:01.569
But anybody else,
they already bought.

27:01.570 --> 27:04.447
Ivar.

27:04.488 --> 27:06.157
Anything else?

27:07.241 --> 27:08.784
Look,

27:08.826 --> 27:11.954
they don't know you got me now.

27:11.996 --> 27:15.916
I can work on the inside
for you, man.

27:15.917 --> 27:17.584
Triple-cross.

27:17.585 --> 27:19.462
Do this for me instead.

27:19.503 --> 27:22.256
( gunshot )
( gasps ) I can--

27:25.509 --> 27:27.261
<i>Remember where I found you?</i>

27:27.262 --> 27:29.805
Pushing Baby Aspirin
to club kids.

27:29.847 --> 27:31.097
<i>( Blake gurgling )</i>

27:31.098 --> 27:32.850
Johnny Mank wanted
to cap you in the alley.

27:32.892 --> 27:36.479
I said, "Nah,
there's potential here."

27:36.520 --> 27:38.855
( gurgling )

27:38.856 --> 27:41.692
Now you just shit my carpet.

27:44.946 --> 27:47.448
( gasping, gurgling )

28:17.478 --> 28:20.356
Ani: <i>Can't remember anything?
Something I can use?</i>

28:20.357 --> 28:22.607
<i>( Eliot sighs )</i>

28:22.608 --> 28:24.527
<i>Well, I grouped them</i>
<i>as hedonists.</i>

28:24.528 --> 28:28.321
<i>And they seemed very close</i>
<i>in a secretive way.</i>

28:28.322 --> 28:32.618
<i>And they did not stay long.
We had no real relationship.</i>

28:32.827 --> 28:35.078
You seem pretty friendly here.

28:35.079 --> 28:38.415
Well, at the time
everyone was a pilgrim.

28:38.416 --> 28:42.084
You understand? Everyone was passing
in their separate journeys.

28:42.085 --> 28:44.255
And not all looking
for the same thing.

28:44.256 --> 28:47.048
Some exploit openness
and freedom.

28:47.049 --> 28:50.176
It was a shadow
of our best intentions.

28:50.177 --> 28:53.179
But people came and went,
faces lost.

28:53.180 --> 28:55.641
I regret so much of that time.

29:05.025 --> 29:09.530
I remembered his face finally.

29:12.408 --> 29:14.910
The man who took me away.

29:16.537 --> 29:19.123
You always said
you couldn't remember anything.

29:21.208 --> 29:23.377
People came and went.

29:25.880 --> 29:28.048
But there was a man...

29:29.383 --> 29:31.343
and I remember his face.

29:34.221 --> 29:38.683
And I think I always
remembered it.

29:38.684 --> 29:41.186
We couldn't sleep.

29:41.187 --> 29:43.647
I wandered the forest
for four days.

29:43.648 --> 29:46.149
Can't see it, those four days,

29:46.150 --> 29:50.528
but I remembered his face.

29:50.529 --> 29:52.907
I wish I could--
if I could just give you back--

29:54.158 --> 29:56.785
my father-- you see,
my father, he was--

29:58.078 --> 29:59.872
He was a harsh man.
He was strict.

29:59.873 --> 30:02.041
I wasn't going to be like him.

30:03.709 --> 30:06.419
Oh, God.

30:06.420 --> 30:08.880
God damn everything.

30:08.881 --> 30:11.342
That's what I say.

30:15.471 --> 30:18.431
( sighs )

30:18.432 --> 30:20.184
Are you gonna turn yourself in?

30:20.185 --> 30:22.852
No.

30:22.853 --> 30:24.938
I can't.

30:24.939 --> 30:27.024
But I can fix it.

30:28.609 --> 30:30.945
I wish your life
had been easier.

30:35.783 --> 30:39.036
You didn't ask me if I did it.

30:39.078 --> 30:40.536
It doesn't matter.

30:40.537 --> 30:43.207
You're the most innocent
person I've ever known.

30:44.659 --> 30:47.745
<i>( car approaching )</i>

31:04.428 --> 31:06.763
Thank you.
I won't forget this.

31:06.764 --> 31:10.016
The APB on you,
they're watching your house.

31:10.017 --> 31:12.269
I should have trusted you
with more of this.

31:12.270 --> 31:14.771
I think with that harassment,

31:14.772 --> 31:16.607
I could have stepped up more.

31:16.649 --> 31:18.442
- Helped you out.
- It's all right.

31:18.443 --> 31:20.443
I was jealous.

31:20.444 --> 31:22.112
I'll say it.

31:22.113 --> 31:24.115
I should have stopped
thinking of you that way

31:24.116 --> 31:25.615
or switched partners.

31:25.616 --> 31:28.619
No, I fucked up there.

31:28.661 --> 31:30.787
You didn't.

31:30.788 --> 31:33.624
I think I--

31:33.666 --> 31:36.961
I think I might be unfair
to people sometimes.

31:41.716 --> 31:43.717
Stay safe.

31:43.718 --> 31:45.886
And stay alive.

31:51.892 --> 31:55.437
Please be careful.
Please get out of this.

31:55.438 --> 31:57.064
I will.

32:07.992 --> 32:09.742
Follow them to Eugene.

32:09.743 --> 32:12.995
They're gonna exit.
Better if you don't know where.

32:12.996 --> 32:16.248
- And watch for tails more than anything.
- Copy that.

32:16.249 --> 32:19.962
Had to toss my phone,
so I'll call you on a burner, check in.

32:19.963 --> 32:21.754
Thank you for this.

32:21.755 --> 32:23.591
Again.

32:23.632 --> 32:25.176
Fuck you, Bezzerides.

32:40.733 --> 32:43.151
Got three in one day.

32:43.152 --> 32:45.069
Bet that's a record.

32:45.070 --> 32:48.365
- <i> ( car door opens, closes )</i>
- <i> ( engine starts )</i>

33:06.342 --> 33:08.176
Delegate nothing.

33:08.177 --> 33:10.261
It's worse than we thought.

33:10.262 --> 33:13.724
We've been in a secret war here
the last six months or so.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.391
Everybody's bought.

33:15.392 --> 33:17.268
Ivar?

33:17.269 --> 33:19.103
Don't tip, either.

33:19.104 --> 33:22.440
Better they think
we're in the dark.

33:22.441 --> 33:24.943
Jordan just walked in.

33:24.944 --> 33:27.028
I'll catch her.

33:27.029 --> 33:28.613
No.

33:28.614 --> 33:31.242
Bring her inside.

33:40.793 --> 33:42.294
<i>( door closes )</i>

33:44.588 --> 33:47.382
Here we are.

33:47.383 --> 33:49.760
Under the bright lights.

33:52.846 --> 33:57.017
They're taking everything,
even what we got left.

33:59.561 --> 34:01.647
<i>They'll come for me.</i>

34:05.567 --> 34:07.945
What can I do?

34:17.621 --> 34:20.498
Pack a bag.
Neils is going with you.

34:20.498 --> 34:22.376
You can't stay at home any more.

34:22.377 --> 34:23.751
All right.

34:23.752 --> 34:26.920
I'll meet you tomorrow.

34:26.922 --> 34:28.505
I love you.

34:28.507 --> 34:31.010
I love you.

34:45.023 --> 34:49.445
This is GIA graded
with a dossier.

34:49.485 --> 34:51.696
It tests excellent in optical

34:51.697 --> 34:53.614
and symmetry analysis.

34:53.657 --> 34:56.869
Five carats, $700,000.

34:56.909 --> 34:59.371
It'll be between
five and six million.

34:59.413 --> 35:01.790
I'd rather split the total
among more stones.

35:01.832 --> 35:04.124
They don't all need
to be that high-end.

35:04.125 --> 35:06.628
But I'll need the exchange
to happen fast.

35:06.629 --> 35:08.921
Then it is not
about the stones.

35:08.922 --> 35:11.966
It is about the money
behind the stones.

35:11.967 --> 35:15.471
You are changing money you
are not supposed to have.

35:15.472 --> 35:18.723
We do not engage
in such practices.

35:18.724 --> 35:21.643
The money will be
untraceable in itself.

35:21.685 --> 35:24.897
Abner Ehrman told me
I could work with you.

35:24.938 --> 35:28.566
Please, articulate
the percentage

35:28.567 --> 35:31.570
you'd require in order
to transact with me.

35:32.738 --> 35:34.155
40%.

35:34.156 --> 35:36.407
And all exchanges happen here.

35:36.408 --> 35:39.826
As we have not done business,
like today, you will come alone.

35:39.827 --> 35:41.997
It includes
my guarantee of quality

35:41.998 --> 35:45.125
and a secure exchange.

35:56.470 --> 35:58.512
Have your friends
ever been to Venezuela?

35:58.513 --> 36:00.597
No, they've talked about going.

36:00.598 --> 36:02.809
I wanted to treat them.
Engagement present.

36:02.810 --> 36:05.561
Barquisimeto is beautiful.

36:05.562 --> 36:08.438
I've got them both booked out
of Portland in five days.

36:08.439 --> 36:10.857
And the tickets are alterable?
We can change them up if we need to?

36:10.858 --> 36:13.862
Yes, sir. For that price, they
let you do what you want.

36:13.863 --> 36:15.821
Armin:
Ours are the best.

36:15.822 --> 36:19.116
Digital everything,
including the chip.

36:19.117 --> 36:22.703
But you still owe us
for the consignment, Frank.

36:22.704 --> 36:24.372
300.

36:24.373 --> 36:26.041
Which I'll pay
the day after tomorrow.

36:26.042 --> 36:29.044
- With an extra five on top.
- With what?

36:32.422 --> 36:34.632
You know about the Russians?

36:34.633 --> 36:37.760
They're dropping roots--
women, drugs.

36:37.761 --> 36:40.931
Taking a chunk of development
along the rail corridor.

36:42.891 --> 36:45.185
You'll be taken over
inside a year.

36:48.230 --> 36:50.022
Give me what I need,

36:50.023 --> 36:52.234
I'll help them choke
on their piece of pie.

36:52.235 --> 36:54.360
That's 100 now,

36:54.361 --> 36:57.239
seven, day after tomorrow.

36:58.198 --> 37:00.866
And this buys what?

37:00.867 --> 37:03.536
I need two clean cars
that are fast

37:03.537 --> 37:06.163
and some firepower.

37:06.164 --> 37:08.415
Why trust we'd ever
see you again?

37:08.416 --> 37:10.752
Because I need
that clean passport.

37:10.753 --> 37:12.837
Then I'm moving on.

37:12.838 --> 37:14.880
I get where I'm going,

37:14.881 --> 37:17.133
I got another half mil for you.

37:17.134 --> 37:20.011
What are you planning, Frank?

37:20.012 --> 37:24.306
You might say
my ship's come in.

37:24.307 --> 37:26.143
And who sails this ship?

37:33.817 --> 37:34.774
<i>( door closes )</i>

37:34.775 --> 37:36.943
You got an APB
on Davis's murder?

37:36.944 --> 37:39.656
Davis was supposed to meet
me and get the whole story.

37:39.657 --> 37:41.323
Found her there dead.

37:41.324 --> 37:43.618
They probably did it with one
of the pieces I keep at home.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.789
I switched license plates
at a fucking mall.

37:47.790 --> 37:51.125
That's it, then.
She was our only authority.

37:51.126 --> 37:53.503
You and her are fugitives.

37:56.798 --> 37:59.843
Well, it doesn't make sense.

38:01.762 --> 38:04.180
It was cops.

38:04.181 --> 38:06.515
Back in the '92 robbery,

38:06.516 --> 38:08.641
Burris and Dixon were serving
under Holloway.

38:08.642 --> 38:10.812
Caspere worked
at the same station.

38:10.813 --> 38:13.189
Jewelry store
was their district.

38:13.190 --> 38:15.484
Caspere probably
helped them move the stones.

38:15.485 --> 38:17.902
They were all working together.

38:17.903 --> 38:19.862
Orphaned two kids.

38:19.863 --> 38:21.531
<i>Leonard and Laura.</i>

38:23.116 --> 38:24.910
So that's how they bought in.

38:24.911 --> 38:28.162
The diamonds
and whatever they got for them

38:28.163 --> 38:30.372
went to Chessani.

38:30.373 --> 38:32.584
Next couple of years,
they migrate

38:32.585 --> 38:35.294
into six-figure
salaries in Vinci.

38:35.295 --> 38:37.047
Their own private fiefdom.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.839
Except Dixon.

38:38.840 --> 38:40.716
He was just a regular dick.

38:40.717 --> 38:44.513
Dixon was checking in on those
diamonds before we ever found them.

38:46.139 --> 38:48.683
Maybe he knew Caspere
held onto them.

38:50.018 --> 38:52.143
Maybe it meant
leverage for him.

38:52.144 --> 38:53.811
But Dixon taking that headshot,

38:53.812 --> 38:55.730
I checked every arrest record.

38:55.731 --> 38:57.649
<i>Burris busted</i>
<i>Ledo Amarilla in '06.</i>

38:57.650 --> 39:00.693
Released after interrogation,
no notes kept.

39:00.694 --> 39:02.072
<i>That whole day was a setup.</i>

39:02.073 --> 39:04.156
Amarilla, too.

39:04.157 --> 39:06.574
He thought it was gonna go
a different way, I think.

39:06.575 --> 39:09.536
That's what Caspere's
place was tossed for.

39:09.537 --> 39:11.246
Burris, Holloway,
Dixon, whoever,

39:11.247 --> 39:12.956
they were looking
for those diamonds.

39:12.957 --> 39:16.543
The last piece of evidence
for a 23-year-old double murder.

39:16.544 --> 39:18.547
Tascha was gonna
blackmail Caspere.

39:18.548 --> 39:22.633
So Holloway, Burris,
they killed Caspere.

39:22.634 --> 39:24.718
Ani:
<i>That doesn't make sense.</i>

39:24.719 --> 39:28.471
Him dying bought them all exposure,
kicked this whole thing off.

39:28.472 --> 39:31.935
And if they had Caspere, why wouldn't they
torture him for the fucking diamonds?

39:31.936 --> 39:34.728
I mean, it's--
( groans )

39:34.729 --> 39:36.898
- ( sighs )
- ( phone buzzes )

39:40.568 --> 39:43.280
_

39:50.662 --> 39:52.663
I gotta head home soon.

39:52.664 --> 39:54.039
All right.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.083
Could you take this to State?

39:56.084 --> 39:58.294
Ray: <i> State?</i>
Davis is dead.

39:58.295 --> 40:01.673
Geldof was at the party.
How about Ventura Sheriff's?

40:01.674 --> 40:03.590
Oh.

40:03.591 --> 40:05.176
They're looking to do me.

40:06.678 --> 40:11.098
And what have we got?
Some documents for a holding company?

40:11.099 --> 40:13.934
A theory on some
rogue cops from '92?

40:13.935 --> 40:16.687
- <i> Feds?</i>
- Not without more.

40:16.688 --> 40:18.229
Unless one of you guys
got a friend there,

40:18.230 --> 40:19.691
I don't see protection.

40:24.988 --> 40:27.906
That ain't a fucking mayor.

40:27.907 --> 40:32.745
That's a homunculus
state corporations slid into office.

40:32.746 --> 40:35.080
Who the fuck
even is Los Angeles?

40:35.081 --> 40:37.916
Nobody can say.
See? Nobody knows.

40:37.917 --> 40:40.586
Nobody expects shit
to actually work.

40:40.587 --> 40:43.047
<i>Me, my family, we are Vinci.</i>

40:43.048 --> 40:45.717
We're a goddamn
political dynasty.

40:47.385 --> 40:49.137
Like the Kennedys.

40:50.430 --> 40:53.516
Do me a favor,
hum my balls a little, huh?

40:58.313 --> 41:00.189
Maybe later.

41:00.190 --> 41:01.941
Frank.

41:04.903 --> 41:06.779
Another gin.

41:06.780 --> 41:08.906
Time to hit the road, Austin.

41:08.907 --> 41:10.616
( laughs )

41:10.617 --> 41:12.325
You don't tell me
what time it is.

41:12.326 --> 41:15.453
I'm just thinking you might want to
get home and take care of business.

41:15.454 --> 41:17.205
What the fuck's that mean?

41:17.206 --> 41:20.583
Your boy Prince Tony has been greasing
the skids to slide into your chair.

41:20.584 --> 41:23.127
Buying the attorney general
with his hookers.

41:23.128 --> 41:25.379
Working with a Russian
named Osip Agranov,

41:25.380 --> 41:27.381
Jacob McCandless from Catalast.

41:27.382 --> 41:29.928
All this in your house
behind your back.

41:31.471 --> 41:33.765
Sober up.
You might realize you're getting fucked.

41:33.766 --> 41:37.227
Now get out of here.
Closing time all around.

41:50.490 --> 41:52.992
I'd have known,
I'd have gotten the red carpet out.

41:52.993 --> 41:54.953
Let me make you a drink.

42:11.094 --> 42:14.763
Our company bought
the lien here, Frank.

42:14.764 --> 42:17.099
Same thing at the Lux.

42:17.100 --> 42:18.600
The clubs are ours.

42:18.601 --> 42:20.394
The clubs?

42:20.395 --> 42:23.940
Shit, man, I'm working
just to stay in the black, here.

42:23.941 --> 42:26.733
We think we can do better.

42:26.734 --> 42:30.029
Bringing in our own girls,
move our own products,

42:30.030 --> 42:31.905
wash our own money.

42:31.906 --> 42:34.909
We're going to be doing a lot
of business in California now.

42:38.997 --> 42:40.998
Good for you.

42:40.999 --> 42:44.793
I tell you, hindsight,

42:44.794 --> 42:47.211
I was out of my element
with that land stuff.

42:47.212 --> 42:48.673
Stick to what you know, right?

42:48.674 --> 42:52.760
I must say, you're taking this
better than expected.

42:54.220 --> 42:57.055
Is Mr. Churchman around?
Blake?

42:57.056 --> 43:00.727
Shit, no. Guy's been around
less the last three months

43:00.728 --> 43:02.728
than my wife's period.

43:02.729 --> 43:06.315
You know, Frank, my board,

43:06.316 --> 43:09.401
they thought we should
take you out.

43:09.402 --> 43:13.822
I said, "Frank Semyon
understands business.

43:13.823 --> 43:15.073
He'll adjust."

43:15.074 --> 43:18.244
So what are my prospects?
Straight up.

43:19.829 --> 43:23.082
You can manage the day-to-day of
the casino and the club.

43:23.083 --> 43:25.125
We put you on salary.

43:25.126 --> 43:27.503
I said,
"Frank knows clubs."

43:30.256 --> 43:32.592
I had ideas of getting
out of this, you know.

43:32.593 --> 43:35.802
There's no such thing
for you, Frank.

43:35.803 --> 43:39.181
That world isn't yours.
You manage clubs.

43:39.182 --> 43:42.101
In time, we find
something new to build on.

43:44.103 --> 43:46.271
Well, what can I say to that?

43:46.272 --> 43:49.775
After all, no fighting
what you can't change.

43:49.776 --> 43:54.488
Look, I ain't lasted this
long without some knowledge

43:54.489 --> 43:56.281
of my own limitations.

43:56.282 --> 44:00.035
And it is my hope
that we can fucking build on this.

44:00.036 --> 44:02.621
Going into the future.

44:02.622 --> 44:04.707
( clinks )

44:15.218 --> 44:19.179
- Velcoro.
- <i> What's up, man?</i>

44:19.180 --> 44:20.807
I wanted to call.

44:22.475 --> 44:24.726
I think--

44:24.727 --> 44:28.397
I ain't told anybody
about this other...

44:30.024 --> 44:31.358
thing.

44:31.359 --> 44:34.653
<i>But somebody sent me</i>
<i>these pictures.</i>

44:34.654 --> 44:36.196
<i>Pictures of me.</i>

44:36.197 --> 44:37.906
What, of our thing?

44:37.907 --> 44:40.868
<i>No, it's something else.</i>
<i>This is mine.</i>

44:43.329 --> 44:45.623
I think I might be walking
into something.

44:46.958 --> 44:48.835
<i>Then don't.</i>

44:50.837 --> 44:54.590
- I'll call you back.
- <i> Listen, hold on. Wait...</i>

45:07.019 --> 45:09.020
What the fuck is this?

45:09.021 --> 45:12.107
Orders.
I gotta take your gun.

45:12.108 --> 45:14.610
Don't make a thing of it.
You've got eyes all over you.

45:22.285 --> 45:24.704
Come on,
I can get you through this.

45:27.415 --> 45:29.124
Black Mountain?

45:29.125 --> 45:31.251
Not anymore.

45:31.252 --> 45:32.918
Ares Security.
We rebranded.

45:32.919 --> 45:35.881
We just service one client now--
Catalast Group.

45:40.845 --> 45:43.180
When you got in touch,
what was that?

45:43.181 --> 45:45.807
I had orders to check on you.

45:45.808 --> 45:48.560
After all that press stuff,

45:48.561 --> 45:50.896
make sure you kept
confidentiality.

45:52.231 --> 45:55.818
This is your situation.
I didn't make it.

45:57.987 --> 45:59.779
Let's go.

45:59.780 --> 46:01.782
<i>They just want to talk.</i>

46:17.340 --> 46:19.758
That was Woodrugh.

46:19.759 --> 46:21.885
Something's up with him.

46:21.886 --> 46:24.471
- What?
- I don't know.

46:24.472 --> 46:26.264
He said he'd call me back.

46:26.265 --> 46:29.934
We need an exit strategy.
Get out of the country.

46:29.935 --> 46:32.855
There's no way
they'll let us go to trial.

46:34.690 --> 46:35.899
<i>You hear me?</i>

46:35.900 --> 46:38.277
Vera said this girl's
name was Laura.

46:38.278 --> 46:41.613
Does she look--
she look familiar?

46:41.614 --> 46:44.115
I swear,
there's something--

46:44.116 --> 46:47.036
No.
Her name is Erica.

46:48.204 --> 46:51.623
From the city manager's office.

46:51.624 --> 46:53.750
She was Caspere's secretary.

46:53.751 --> 46:55.709
- You met her on the movie set.
- Yeah.

46:55.710 --> 46:58.754
Woodrugh said
one of the orphans in that robbery,

46:58.755 --> 47:00.633
- her name was Laura.
- Laura.

47:04.220 --> 47:05.845
- Ooh.
- You got it?

47:05.846 --> 47:07.972
Yeah, it's here.

47:07.973 --> 47:10.226
Let me see.

47:12.478 --> 47:14.063
I don't know.
What do you think?

47:36.252 --> 47:39.296
You've been looking
for information about me, son.

47:39.297 --> 47:42.007
Well, here's
your chance to ask.

47:47.221 --> 47:49.974
All right, Mr. Patterson.
Thank you.

47:50.307 --> 47:53.936
No, this was very helpful.

47:55.646 --> 47:58.107
Moved out of her apartment
six weeks ago.

47:58.149 --> 48:00.234
Quit the city manager's
office around that time.

48:00.317 --> 48:03.152
Woodrugh could do a trace on her.
Credit cards, whatever.

48:03.153 --> 48:04.655
Figure out where she went.

48:04.656 --> 48:08.117
Let's try him again.
Voicemail.

48:10.619 --> 48:12.453
( sighs )

48:12.454 --> 48:14.080
What now?

48:14.081 --> 48:17.042
Ride it out till morning.

48:19.128 --> 48:21.922
Guess we'll wait for Woodrugh.

48:25.676 --> 48:28.512
( sighs )

48:30.764 --> 48:33.433
( people chatting )

48:33.434 --> 48:35.976
We got a gas leak
spilling into the AC.

48:35.977 --> 48:38.228
Need to clear the place
for three hours or so.

48:38.229 --> 48:40.858
- Are you serious?
- Just fucking do it.

48:40.859 --> 48:42.568
Everybody out.

48:47.823 --> 48:51.283
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a sudden safety issue,

48:51.284 --> 48:54.330
<i>we need to request that</i>
<i>you cash out your chips</i>

48:54.331 --> 48:56.457
<i>and vacate the premises.</i>

48:59.209 --> 49:02.378
These tunnels exist
under the entire city.

49:02.379 --> 49:05.381
Most people don't know that.

49:05.382 --> 49:10.178
The pictures of you two
were a happy coincidence

49:10.179 --> 49:13.432
we came across when clearing
Detective Dixon's apartment.

49:13.433 --> 49:17.727
Apparently he was
keeping an eye on you.

49:17.728 --> 49:20.938
Teague always had
a nose for secrets.

49:20.939 --> 49:22.689
If you had just been honest
about who you are,

49:22.690 --> 49:24.443
nobody'd be able to run you.

49:24.444 --> 49:28.697
<i>- You know that, right?</i>
- And this is what?

49:29.323 --> 49:31.784
Some documents were stolen
from a private gathering

49:31.785 --> 49:34.452
of citizens in Monterey.

49:34.453 --> 49:37.080
I believe you have
these documents.

49:37.081 --> 49:38.791
Do not bother lying.

49:40.584 --> 49:42.460
Not on me.

49:42.461 --> 49:44.337
Mm-mm.

49:44.338 --> 49:47.007
Velcoro?
Bezzerides?

49:48.467 --> 49:50.551
Where are they?

49:50.552 --> 49:54.055
- I don't know.
- Oh.

49:54.056 --> 49:57.309
Velcoro has the papers.
He's turning them into the feds.

50:04.108 --> 50:05.566
But I can call him.

50:05.567 --> 50:07.903
We set up a meeting.

50:09.655 --> 50:11.864
But I skate.

50:11.865 --> 50:14.827
And I get every fucking
copy of those pictures.

50:14.828 --> 50:18.037
That's accommodating.
Maybe too much.

50:18.038 --> 50:20.540
Velcoro don't mean shit to me.

50:20.541 --> 50:22.542
This fuck-up
dragging down.

50:22.543 --> 50:24.502
He had me look you up.

50:24.503 --> 50:26.713
Davis used all of us
and she's fucking dead.

50:26.714 --> 50:28.756
The other, this Ventura dyke,

50:28.757 --> 50:31.259
she's been on my ass
from the jump.

50:31.260 --> 50:33.637
I could give a shit
about either of them.

50:35.347 --> 50:38.475
Call Ray.
Set a meeting.

50:52.614 --> 50:55.950
Osip wants to know
where is gas leak.

50:55.951 --> 50:57.410
It's...

50:57.411 --> 51:00.455
- ( gunshot )
- <i> ( thuds )</i>

51:10.132 --> 51:12.843
( gas hissing )

51:19.600 --> 51:21.685
<i>( fire crackling )</i>

51:27.274 --> 51:29.358
<i>( TV playing )</i>

51:29.359 --> 51:30.985
I'm just tired.

51:30.986 --> 51:32.612
<i>There.</i>

51:32.613 --> 51:33.945
I want to go to bed now.

51:33.946 --> 51:35.449
That's "Splendor
in the Grass."

51:37.409 --> 51:39.201
I love that one.

51:39.202 --> 51:42.914
<i>You tell Bud Stamper</i>
<i>to bring you home earlier.</i>

51:42.915 --> 51:44.874
Looks old.

51:44.875 --> 51:46.460
It is.

51:47.878 --> 51:49.420
Sad.

51:49.421 --> 51:52.299
<i>Good night, sleep tight,</i>
<i>don't let the bed bugs bite.</i>

51:52.300 --> 51:53.926
Deanie:
<i>Good night.</i>

51:56.845 --> 51:59.640
I don't get
any service down here.

52:02.309 --> 52:05.645
- Let me see. Ah!
Man: - Hey, hey!

52:05.646 --> 52:08.607
Oh, boy, you fucking up.
Cut the shit, son.

52:08.608 --> 52:10.232
Shut up.

52:10.233 --> 52:12.361
Toss all the guns.
Kill the fucking lights.

52:12.362 --> 52:15.154
- Now!
- Do it.

52:15.155 --> 52:16.781
Now...

52:16.782 --> 52:18.866
Kick 'em forward.

52:18.867 --> 52:20.243
Move.

52:25.499 --> 52:28.001
( gunshots )

52:53.110 --> 52:56.070
This is gonna be
hard on my son.

52:56.071 --> 52:58.073
The things he'll hear about me.

52:58.074 --> 53:00.991
We can get out of this.

53:00.992 --> 53:04.704
We get that girl's story,
walk her into the feds.

53:04.705 --> 53:06.748
Fucking CNN.

53:10.085 --> 53:12.170
I'm sorry.

53:14.631 --> 53:16.299
I brought you back in this.

53:16.300 --> 53:18.385
No, I made a choice.

53:21.388 --> 53:23.515
A long time ago.

53:24.933 --> 53:27.768
I, uh...

53:27.769 --> 53:32.190
I thought everything
came from something else.

53:35.652 --> 53:37.737
But it came from there.

53:41.408 --> 53:43.743
You had something
like that, too, once, right?

53:51.751 --> 53:54.421
It's not something
I talk about.

53:55.589 --> 53:57.340
Well...

53:59.509 --> 54:01.678
It's one of the things
I admire about you.

55:02.572 --> 55:04.908
( sighs )

55:07.994 --> 55:10.747
You're not a bad man.

55:16.753 --> 55:18.254
Yes...

55:21.174 --> 55:22.759
I am.

55:34.729 --> 55:36.898
Do you miss it?

55:40.402 --> 55:41.944
What?

55:41.945 --> 55:43.988
( grunts )

55:47.867 --> 55:49.869
Anything?

56:59.105 --> 57:00.690
( gun clicks )

57:08.865 --> 57:10.700
- ( gunshots )
- ( shouts )

01:01:46.392 --> 01:01:49.729
Fuck you.
No, no.

01:01:49.770 --> 01:01:51.689
No. Fuck you.
