WEBVTT

00:06.474 --> 00:08.909
Is that olive loaf?
I want olive loaf.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.811
It's not officially olive loaf,

00:10.878 --> 00:13.481
but I smooshed together
some olives and some meat.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.583
You'll like it.

00:15.649 --> 00:19.120
Hope's getting
new baby clothes.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.222
That guy who sells socks
out of his trunk

00:21.289 --> 00:23.624
in the drug store parking lot
has fabric now.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.632
Virginia, would you
give her her pill today?

00:31.699 --> 00:34.402
No. It's an even-numbered day.
It's your turn.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.237
Just shove it in her mouth.

00:36.304 --> 00:37.438
She bites me.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.407
I still have my mark
from two days ago.

00:39.473 --> 00:40.508
Figure it out.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.147
Why do you have to
make this so difficult?

00:46.214 --> 00:50.151
Don't have a lot of
other things going on.

00:53.521 --> 00:57.825
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh. *

00:57.891 --> 00:59.793
SABRINA:
Check it out.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.330
"So, my parents named me
Frank, 'cause they love

01:02.396 --> 01:04.732
tube-shaped meat."

01:04.798 --> 01:06.934
Let me do the lady.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.139
(as elderly lady):
"I'll take a quarter pound
of the chicken salad."

01:12.840 --> 01:15.075
But that's what she
was probably saying.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.810
I know. That's why
I said it.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.146
Yeah...

01:18.212 --> 01:19.847
You don't get what
we're doing, do you?

01:19.913 --> 01:21.982
BARNEY (as Jimmy Stewart): Could
an available sales associate

01:22.049 --> 01:24.118
bring a nose hair clipper
to the manager's office

01:24.185 --> 01:26.287
for a price check?

01:26.354 --> 01:29.257
I repeat-- could an available
sales associate...

01:29.323 --> 01:31.325
(knocking)
Oh, good,
you heard me.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.761
What's with the funny voice?

01:33.827 --> 01:35.062
It's Jimmy Stewart.

01:35.129 --> 01:37.465
I had to disguise my
voice because my ex-wife
is in the store.

01:37.531 --> 01:40.134
JIMMY:
What's she doing here?
I don't know. Last time

01:40.201 --> 01:42.603
I saw her she was living in
Phoenix with her new husband.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.205
But between them
closing the blinds

01:44.272 --> 01:45.673
and me having to stay
100 yards away from her,

01:45.739 --> 01:46.974
it wasn't worth
flying there anymore.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.809
Wait, is that
Barney Jr.?

01:48.876 --> 01:50.043
No, that's Trevor.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.545
He's her son with Doug.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.081
The man she left the man
she left me for.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.616
Any strays?

01:55.683 --> 01:57.851
Let me take a shot.
But I'm going to leave a couple.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.887
You don't want her to think
you care too much.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.355
I need to look my best.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.724
Gloria hasn't seen me
since my gastric bypass.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.894
I was skinny when we
got married, but then
I put on 200 pounds.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.362
Got 'em.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.199
Aw, Jimmy!

02:12.666 --> 02:14.768
(snoring)

02:22.109 --> 02:23.844
Hey! Hey! Hey!

02:23.911 --> 02:25.346
Hey, release! Release!

02:25.413 --> 02:27.348
Release.
Release!

02:28.416 --> 02:30.684
That's puzzling.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.853
Thursday's bite
had more marks.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.955
Did you lose a tooth?

02:35.022 --> 02:37.791
Yeah. Last night.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.428
I got into a bit of a tussle
with a piece of taffy

02:40.494 --> 02:43.364
and I swallowed
my back right molar.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.165
The gold one?
Yep.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.167
So, uh, what are you
going to do about that?

02:47.235 --> 02:48.236
About what?

02:48.302 --> 02:49.637
The tooth.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.839
It's got to be worth
a few hundred dollars.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.441
You gonna, uh, go after it?

02:53.507 --> 02:57.077
Oh, God, you're disgusting.

02:57.144 --> 02:59.447
You want me to go through
my poo?

02:59.513 --> 03:00.681
It's worth hundreds of dollars.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.182
Yeah, well, I'm 85 years old.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.852
I'm not going to go through my
poo to find a stupid tooth.

03:04.918 --> 03:05.919
It's gone.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.123
Mind if I go through it?

03:10.190 --> 03:11.525
Yeah, I mind.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.661
Stay the hell out of my poo.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.297
It might not even
be the gold one.
Let me look again.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.567
Oh!

03:20.801 --> 03:21.935
(swallows)

03:25.406 --> 03:27.541
We do have fun,
don't we, Burt?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.110
"Barney, you look great.

03:30.177 --> 03:33.247
And I'm so glad to see you
got rid of that second head."

03:33.314 --> 03:35.783
JIMMY: "I'm Barney saying
something funny.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.852
"Look at me, I'm shaking
hands with a boy.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.053
"I sure am.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.855
Shaking hands with a boy?"

03:41.922 --> 03:44.492
Sabrina, can you take
Trevor to the break room

03:44.558 --> 03:45.993
to get him an
official work shirt?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.961
This young buck's
joining the Howdy's team.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.697
Well, welcome to Howdy's.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.733
And just remember, if you're
honest and you work hard,

03:52.800 --> 03:54.902
you'll be mocked and ridiculed
by all the other employees.

03:54.968 --> 03:58.372
Gloria's divorced and thinking
about moving back to town.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.608
She wants to spend
a little time together.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.177
I need you guys to
keep Trevor occupied.

04:04.244 --> 04:08.349
I'm just worried he
might be a little bit
of a hmm-hmm blocker.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.094
VIRGINIA:
Hey, check us out.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.163
I bought way too much
fabric. We're twins.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.465
Adorable.

04:24.532 --> 04:25.999
Question-- if
Maw Maw swallowed a gold tooth

04:26.066 --> 04:28.135
worth a couple hundred bucks
and doesn't retrieve it,

04:28.201 --> 04:29.370
potentially that makes it

04:29.437 --> 04:30.338
a finders-keepers situation,
right?

04:30.404 --> 04:32.373
Oh, my God.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.674
You're disgusting.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.143
Why?
We are not those people.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.244
What people?

04:37.311 --> 04:38.979
Poo going through people.

04:39.046 --> 04:42.049
People so desperate
they go through poo for
a couple hundred dollars.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.051
It's disgusting.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.420
Well, so are all those rich jerk
clients you talk about.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.721
Always flushing
money down the drain.

04:47.788 --> 04:51.325
We would literally be
flushing money down the drain.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.594
Burt, I will steal
coins from a fountain,

04:53.661 --> 04:55.429
I'll even do clinical
drug trials again,

04:55.496 --> 04:58.165
as long as I'm not the placebo--
I don't like feeling tricked,

04:58.231 --> 05:00.200
but there is
no amount of gold

05:00.267 --> 05:04.372
that's worth rummaging through
that lady's butt custard.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.408
Oh, check it out.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.109
"I like to stick my nose

05:09.176 --> 05:11.512
in this chicken's butt
'cause it really relaxes me."

05:11.579 --> 05:15.649
"I have to be careful.
I can't sniff too hard

05:15.716 --> 05:17.885
"or I'll suck this chicken
right in my gigantic nose.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.521
"I did that once with
a Cornish game hen.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.322
I think it's still up there."

05:22.390 --> 05:23.424
You're pretty good at this.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.992
What are you, like, 32, 33...?

05:25.058 --> 05:26.093
34.
34.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.995
(chuckles)

05:28.061 --> 05:29.162
Hey, what's so funny?

05:29.229 --> 05:31.532
Oh, we're just doing that thing
that you stink at

05:31.599 --> 05:33.066
where we make up what
people are saying.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.403
He made a pretty good joke
about your big nose.

05:35.469 --> 05:38.205
My nose is normal sized.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.808
I'm sorry, what? I couldn't hear
you over your nose.

05:40.874 --> 05:41.775
Ooh.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.545
Yeah, that...
That joke's a stinker

05:44.612 --> 05:47.415
even I could smell with
my normal size nose.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.949
(laughing)

05:53.421 --> 05:57.257
Lean to the left,
then lean to the right.

05:57.324 --> 05:59.660
Oh, hey, Jimmy.

05:59.727 --> 06:00.961
Trevor's teaching me
how to Dougie.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.463
You should try it.
It's pretty easy.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.264
But don't lean too
far to the side,

06:04.331 --> 06:05.699
'cause your nose
might tip you over.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.168
You know, like
a construction crane.

06:08.235 --> 06:11.271
Construction crane.
You're hilarious.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.441
He is, right?
This nose stuff is good.

06:14.408 --> 06:15.709
That young man has tapped into

06:15.776 --> 06:17.478
a very rich area for comedy.

06:21.081 --> 06:24.818
Hey, listen, we need to chat
for a minute, just bro to bro.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.821
I-I think you're funny,
but I need you to back off

06:27.888 --> 06:29.322
a smidge with the
nose insults, okay?

06:29.389 --> 06:32.325
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were
sensitive about it.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.062
You've got a big nose,
I've got big ears.
It's no big deal.

06:35.128 --> 06:38.365
Where I grew up, guys
make fun of each other
about that kind of stuff.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.033
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
Yeah, of course.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.536
It's only a thing because you're
doing it in front of Sabrina.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.905
And I, you know,
I kind of like her.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.173
Oh.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.541
Mm-hmm, yeah. So...

06:47.608 --> 06:49.910
Well, we have
a bigger problem then.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.580
I kind of like her, too.
You're 13.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.683
So? You have a big nose.
We all have our faults.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.819
I guess we'll just have
to see which one she's
willing to overlook.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.555
Plus, I'm funny, and
I can do the Dougie.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.792
What up now, son? Whoo-whoo.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.336
Whoa, somebody's been
to the beauty saloon.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.706
Gloria thought it made me
look like Matthew McConaughey.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.974
(imitating McConaughey):
All right, all right, all right.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.510
It's not as good as
your Jimmy Stewart,

07:22.576 --> 07:24.845
but you keep working at it.
Yeah, well, I got
to get going.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.547
Gloria doesn't like
me to dillydally,

07:26.614 --> 07:29.717
when I'm supposed to be
dallying her dilly.
If you know what I mean.

07:29.783 --> 07:33.554
I think I do,
but I wish I didn't.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.792
Hey look, Jimmy's
nose is here.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.795
The rest of him should be
coming along any minute.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.565
Well, at least I don't have
big ears, Dumbo.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.736
You going to fly away with those
big ears, big ears?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.604
Plus, my parents aren't
divorced.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.039
What up now, son? Whoo-whoo.

07:52.105 --> 07:55.008
My God, Jimmy?! Jimmy,
he's just a kid.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.577
No, it's fine.

07:56.644 --> 07:59.179
A lot of people tease me
about my big ears

07:59.246 --> 08:00.814
and my parents' divorce.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.216
I just... need
to get stronger.

08:03.283 --> 08:06.486
Hey, hey, hey,
it's okay. It's okay.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.092
(clicking and beeping)

08:15.228 --> 08:17.097
What are you doing?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.867
Just making sure the tooth's
still in there.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.068
What?

08:21.134 --> 08:23.336
I started thinking
about the hot tub.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.105
How we found it 20 years ago,

08:25.172 --> 08:26.907
and we've never had the money
to buy a pump for it.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.408
Every time we
had any cash,

08:28.475 --> 08:31.411
some expense would
come up and we couldn't
buy a luxury item.

08:31.478 --> 08:35.515
Anyway, I was thinking, if we
got that tooth and sold it,

08:35.583 --> 08:37.117
we could finally
fix the hot tub.

08:37.184 --> 08:41.188
And then we could sit out here
under the stars,

08:41.254 --> 08:42.656
you and me together.

08:42.723 --> 08:45.626
Just like we always dreamed of.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.995
So you changed your mind.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.930
Well, when I think of it as
money, it feels wrong.

08:49.997 --> 08:56.103
But if Maw Maw swallowed
nights under the stars
that I could enjoy with you

08:56.169 --> 08:58.572
I would go through
her yucky-yuck to get it.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.608
You would?

09:00.674 --> 09:03.243
But if we're really
going to do this,

09:03.310 --> 09:06.580
we can never tell a soul.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.348
No one can know

09:08.415 --> 09:12.019
that we really are
poo going through people.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.827
Let me ask you a question.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.996
You're not one of those kids
who take judo or karate or
anything like that, right?

09:23.063 --> 09:23.997
No.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.967
Good. 'Cause if you
keep making fun of me,

09:27.034 --> 09:28.836
and, yes, I'm saying this
to a 13-year-old,

09:28.902 --> 09:30.503
I'm going to have
to kick your ass.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.707
You lay one finger on me,
and I tell Sabrina
you love her,

09:33.774 --> 09:36.343
and that you wait outside
the bathroom door and
listen to her pee.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.881
I don't do that.
It'll be your word
against mine.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.884
And nobody's going to
believe a guy that beat
up a 13-year-old.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.352
Okay, fine,
I won't beat you up.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.054
Just don't tell Sabrina
that I like her.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.456
God, man, why can't you just
get a girl your own age?

09:49.522 --> 09:51.424
I'm new in town.
I only know Sabrina.

09:51.491 --> 09:53.861
We can fix that.
If I can find you
a girl your own age,

09:53.927 --> 09:55.796
would you stop
making fun of me?

09:55.863 --> 09:59.499
If I stop making fun of you,
who am I going to make fun of?

09:59.566 --> 10:03.671
All right, that makes
1,274 to 1,346.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.372
Left hand's making a comeback.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.975
I can work with that.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.683
Hey.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.317
How about her?

10:17.384 --> 10:19.119
Nice.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.420
Mid to late puberty,

10:20.487 --> 10:22.089
hormones going wild,

10:22.155 --> 10:23.256
that's all me.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.158
Go over and find out if
she thinks I'm cute.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.060
Why me? If I do it it's weird.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.797
Not as weird as you
listening to Sabrina pee.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.464
Sabrina...
Okay, okay, okay.

10:31.531 --> 10:32.900
God. I'll go.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.038
Uh, hi.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.372
I'm sorry to bug you.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.641
I have a friend who thinks
you're real cute.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.246
He's a great kid, new in town.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.181
If you go out with him,
I'd be thrilled.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.350
I could drive
you guys on a date.
Do you like movies?

10:50.417 --> 10:52.652
I could take you to the movies
or out to the lake.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.921
I have a great van.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.723
What the hell's going on here?

10:55.789 --> 10:57.624
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

10:57.691 --> 11:00.160
Hey, no. Nothing bad. Wow.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.729
I'm not talking to
your little girl for me

11:01.795 --> 11:05.432
I'm talking to her for
my friend, the bag
boy over there.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.436
What?!
Oh, no, I didn't mean--

11:09.502 --> 11:11.204
(groans weakly)

11:11.271 --> 11:13.273
(thudding)

11:13.340 --> 11:14.875
Judy...

11:15.976 --> 11:17.878
We have to find that girl.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.847
I think I'm in love.

11:26.053 --> 11:30.523
Spatula, colander,
rubber gloves, bleach...

11:30.590 --> 11:33.794
you're gonna be
sifting through
excrement, aren't you?

11:33.861 --> 11:35.228
I beg your pardon!

11:35.295 --> 11:36.730
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

11:36.797 --> 11:38.331
and I resent the "implination"!

11:38.398 --> 11:40.233
I got some menthol rub
to put under our noses,

11:40.300 --> 11:42.035
so we won't have
to smell the poo.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.978
Oh, man!
We got medium gloves.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.445
I hope you don't rip 'em.

11:52.512 --> 11:57.017
How would I rip them, as you
will be the wearer of them.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.686
As you will be the doer,
doing the deed.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.555
Why should I do the deed?

12:02.622 --> 12:03.590
You're blood-related.

12:03.656 --> 12:04.792
It's almost like
going through your own.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.093
That's stupid.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.563
(sighs)

12:10.630 --> 12:11.932
Okay. Flip a coin.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.335
Call it in the air.
Heads.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.171
Nope. You lose.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.407
- I'm still not doing it.
- It's tails! You have to!

12:20.473 --> 12:21.441
No, I don't.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.742
Why did you suggest a coin toss?

12:22.810 --> 12:25.645
Because I had a 50-50 chance
of winning-- I took a shot.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.948
Unfair. Unfair! Unfair!

12:28.015 --> 12:30.250
Fine. Flip it again.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.419
Heads.
Tails.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.386
Here's the gloves.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.288
No, not doing it.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.990
Stop doing that!

12:37.057 --> 12:38.425
Okay, fine, I'll do it.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.526
(doorbell rings)

12:41.728 --> 12:44.631
I couldn't stop thinking about
the fact you bought a spatula.

12:44.697 --> 12:48.368
I think you're gonna want
a slotted spoon.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.409
So how come you're
not in school?

12:56.476 --> 12:58.678
How come you're a dropout
who works in a grocery store

12:58.745 --> 13:00.080
and can't get a girlfriend?

13:00.147 --> 13:02.816
I was just trying to make
conversation, man.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.985
TREVOR:
There you are.

13:06.719 --> 13:10.223
You can run but you can't hide.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.661
Hey...

13:14.727 --> 13:15.829
remember me from the store?

13:15.896 --> 13:16.864
I'm Trevor.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.132
Yeah! Hi!
I'm Judy.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.168
Wanna hang out, maybe watch
movies at my friend's house?

13:21.234 --> 13:23.303
He says he has a VHS player.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.437
Whatever that is.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.540
I would but...
my dad's super-strict.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.410
He keeps tabs on me with
the GPS on my phone.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.013
And I have to be at practice
for the next two hours.

13:43.891 --> 13:47.560
You know I once
caught a fish... this big?

13:52.365 --> 13:57.037
I cannot believe how sore I am
from one day of running.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.006
You need to stop acting like
a 13-year-old girl

13:59.072 --> 14:00.941
and just tell Sabrina
you like her.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.209
Will you shut up, Mom?

14:02.275 --> 14:03.743
I told you I'll tell her
when I'm ready!

14:03.810 --> 14:05.312
(gentle grunt)

14:05.378 --> 14:08.315
(singsongy):
Somebody got their period.

14:08.381 --> 14:11.018
If I tell Sabrina too soon,
it'll mess up my plan.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.320
Trust me--
I've been watching her.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.655
Things with Sabrina and Wyatt
are always best

14:15.722 --> 14:17.991
when he's away at school and
they don't see each other much.

14:18.058 --> 14:21.328
Oh, look-- Wyatt sent me a kiss
with a video text.

14:23.730 --> 14:24.932
(smacking)

14:26.833 --> 14:29.236
But when they're in the same
city, they start to fight.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.938
But I like it with
a little hair.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.205
Well, I don't.
But I do.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.341
I don't care!
I'm getting my chest waxed!

14:37.444 --> 14:39.179
Christmas break, he'll be here
for a whole month.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.348
Week three, I make my move.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.515
BURT: Sounds like
a solid plan.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.851
I apologize for the
"period" comment.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.353
Thank you.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.455
And for now, I just
have to deal with Trevor.

14:48.521 --> 14:51.491
Just be careful--
blackmail never ends.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.360
Remember that woman I caught
cheating on her husband?

14:53.426 --> 14:56.663
That's why we never
have to pay tolls on I-80.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.231
That's a woman?!

14:58.298 --> 14:59.366
(shudders):
Ooh.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.500
Eh, just have to do it
until Christmas.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.436
Besides, I could use
a little exercise.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.347
Yo!

15:14.414 --> 15:15.382
You!

15:16.583 --> 15:17.550
What are you doing?

15:17.617 --> 15:19.752
Why are you chasing these girls?
Uh...

15:19.819 --> 15:21.288
Is that my daughter's phone?

15:21.354 --> 15:22.155
Uh...

15:22.222 --> 15:23.991
Where the hell is my daughter?

15:24.057 --> 15:26.093
(dance music playing)

15:30.163 --> 15:32.465
You're lucky I
didn't kill ya!

15:32.532 --> 15:33.866
Ya big-nose pervert!

15:33.933 --> 15:35.268
It's not that big, man.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.637
Dude, did you not see
the sock on the front door?

15:37.704 --> 15:40.107
Judy...
Daddy!

15:42.342 --> 15:45.745
I doubt... I doubt very much you
will be seeing young Judy again.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.114
Fine. I was sick
of her, anyway.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.715
Find me a new one.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.684
And this time, I want one with
a little more junk in the trunk.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.786
An Asian-- blonde.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.688
A blonde Asian
with junk in her trunk.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.190
Find her.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.697
What's with all the ruckus?

16:08.301 --> 16:10.337
I have to tell Sabrina
that I love her.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.309
How about this: Sabrina,
all the time we've spent

16:16.376 --> 16:18.178
at the express
check-out lane,

16:18.245 --> 16:19.679
I've been checking you out,

16:19.746 --> 16:21.981
but I've never expressed
how I feel.

16:22.049 --> 16:24.117
I think it should rhyme.
Chicks dig rhymes.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.818
That's true.
What are you gonna wear?

16:25.885 --> 16:27.187
You should
go shirtless.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.122
With maybe a necklace or a hat.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.923
Something to take her eyes
off your slight belly.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.092
How about I put on a shirt?

16:32.159 --> 16:33.293
That'll work.
And make sure you have

16:33.360 --> 16:34.227
a toothpick
sticking out of your mouth.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.428
It says you have good hygiene.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.830
Whatever you say, make sure it
has some flair.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.499
You are a special boy.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.701
And she needs to know
that you're special.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.170
Maybe start with that.

16:43.236 --> 16:46.739
I am a special boy, and you
should know that I am special?

16:46.806 --> 16:47.774
I like it.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.209
You know what?

16:49.276 --> 16:51.111
I think I'm gonna
write her a letter instead.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.448
Where is my Word Jumble?

16:57.650 --> 16:58.851
She's close.

16:58.918 --> 17:01.020
It's showtime, honey.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.935
Stop!

17:16.002 --> 17:18.371
I can't let my
wife do this.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.772
Plus, I don't want
to sit in a hot tub

17:19.839 --> 17:21.774
with a woman who's
sifted through poo.

17:38.758 --> 17:39.692
Stop!

17:39.759 --> 17:43.196
I can't let you
do it, either.

17:43.263 --> 17:47.134
Burt... you know
what this means?

17:49.068 --> 17:50.303
We're not those people.

17:50.370 --> 17:53.039
Oh, my God!
We're not those people!

17:53.106 --> 17:55.142
We're not those
people!

17:56.376 --> 17:59.146
(toilet flushing)

18:16.062 --> 18:17.630
Please don't tell Gloria.

18:17.697 --> 18:20.200
It'll just be one more thing
she has to fix about me.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.903
It's so much pressure!

18:23.970 --> 18:25.538
I have to change
my hair for her,

18:25.605 --> 18:28.308
and wear these weird "metal-y"
eagle-wing shirts.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.310
This is just like
when we were married.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.880
Barney, you
gotta be yourself,

18:33.946 --> 18:36.949
and have somebody love you
for the toy-collecting,

18:37.016 --> 18:38.385
normal shirt wearing,

18:38.451 --> 18:40.420
flat-haired store manager
that you are.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.656
Somebody's going to.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.558
'Cause that store
manager's great.

18:47.394 --> 18:51.198
You got a little
something... right here.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.238
JIMMY: There comes a day
in every man's life

18:58.305 --> 19:00.006
when he has to stand
face-to-face

19:00.072 --> 19:02.175
with the woman he loves
and tell her how he feels.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.077
I'm not that man.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.247
I chose to slip a note
in her locker.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.390
You know what?
I'm proud of you.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.326
It must really feel great.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.297
What must feel great?

19:24.364 --> 19:26.233
I broke if off
with Gloria.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.734
She was no good for me.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.302
She went back home.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.903
So Trevor's gone, too?

19:34.607 --> 19:36.909
There also comes a point
in every man's life

19:36.976 --> 19:38.745
when he has to run
like a little girl

19:38.811 --> 19:40.247
to retrieve a love note
from a locker.

19:40.313 --> 19:43.015
Luckily, I've been on
a little girl's track team

19:43.082 --> 19:44.651
for the last two weeks.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.761
Come on... come on...

19:54.827 --> 19:55.795
(grunting)

19:56.996 --> 19:59.666
Aah! (whimpering)

19:59.732 --> 20:00.900
(gasps)

20:22.589 --> 20:24.457
Sometimes in life, you gotta
bite the bullet

20:24.524 --> 20:25.992
and let the chips fall
where they may.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.629
And if you're lucky, things
might turn out good.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.631
I could see how my words
were touching Sabrina,

20:31.698 --> 20:34.867
and could feel all my hopes
coming true.

20:34.934 --> 20:35.868
Hey, Jimmy...

20:35.935 --> 20:37.637
Yes?

20:37.704 --> 20:40.973
This is the sweetest love letter
from Trevor.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.309
Trevor?

20:42.375 --> 20:43.576
Yeah, well, I mean,
it had to be him.

20:43.643 --> 20:44.944
His spelling is terrible.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.314
He spelled "captivating"
with a "K."

20:47.380 --> 20:50.817
He rhymed "heart"
with "Paul Blart."

20:50.883 --> 20:53.286
Paul Blart had
a humble courage.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.121
It's so cute
that he had a crush.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.856
He wrote a lot of sweet things.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.292
When Trevor gets older, and
he works on his spelling,

20:59.359 --> 21:01.328
he's gonna be irresistible
to women.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.398
Luckily, I didn't have to tell
Sabrina how I felt

21:05.465 --> 21:08.535
before I was ready.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.737
(sighs)

21:10.803 --> 21:13.340
But pretty soon,
I'm gonna have to,

21:13.406 --> 21:15.308
so I needed
to start practicing.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.410
You're dating a guy
named Wyatt--

21:17.477 --> 21:19.612
did you ever stop
to think "Why it?"

21:19.679 --> 21:22.582
Seems like you guys
always argue...
