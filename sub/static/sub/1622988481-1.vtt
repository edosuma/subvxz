00:32.000 --> 00:35.961
Lourdes, I worry that
your nephew is so alone.

00:36.921 --> 00:39.601
Sonia, I worry
about him too, but...

00:39.881 --> 00:41.041
It's the way he lives.

00:41.801 --> 00:43.601
I only see him in the garden

00:44.121 --> 00:45.801
Or here playing this keyboard.

00:46.081 --> 00:47.721
Oh, this is so sad.

00:48.321 --> 00:49.801
I try to make him socialize

00:50.081 --> 00:51.321
with the people in the church, but...

00:52.361 --> 00:54.521
He is very alone,
I can't do anything.

00:55.641 --> 00:58.441
He should get a girlfriend

00:58.801 --> 00:59.961
Some friends!

01:00.681 --> 01:03.481
Because it's not good
to be alone, Lourdes.

01:04.041 --> 01:06.721
God and Our Lady
will put a wonderful girl

01:07.001 --> 01:08.441
in my godson's life!

01:10.881 --> 01:12.961
Look.
Did I get here too soon?

01:13.241 --> 01:15.801
Or will they be late again?

01:19.481 --> 01:21.961
And Hezekiah, his son

01:22.241 --> 01:25.041
- reigned in his stead.
- Amen!

01:25.321 --> 01:27.161
Thank God!

01:27.801 --> 01:31.001
And finally, does anyone want
to offer the next song?

01:31.321 --> 01:33.681
I would like to dedicate this
to all the children

01:33.961 --> 01:35.241
who are hungry in the world.

01:36.041 --> 01:38.521
And for my bastard husband.

01:38.801 --> 01:40.441
That drunk bastard!

01:49.081 --> 01:51.721
- Goodbye.
- Bye, see you next week!

01:52.001 --> 01:53.161
- Bye.
- Bye, see you next week.

01:53.441 --> 01:54.161
Come back soon.

01:55.401 --> 01:55.881
Hi!

01:57.001 --> 01:58.641
You played beautifully today.

01:58.921 --> 02:01.361
Aunt Lourdes said you could
give me some keyboard lessons.

02:02.001 --> 02:03.041
Oh, Sonia!

02:03.321 --> 02:05.361
Tell your husband that
I will pay him all my late rent

02:05.641 --> 02:08.121
next month, okay?
Just a little more patience!

02:08.800 --> 02:10.441
- We can set something up.
- Hey!

02:10.761 --> 02:12.561
- I'll be back tonight!
- Fine.

02:14.521 --> 02:16.201
- Bye, Aunt Lourdes!
- Bye, honey.

02:21.881 --> 02:25.401
My dear, I want to talk to you.
It's very important.

02:25.681 --> 02:27.841
- Come with me?
- Sure, Auntie!

02:32.921 --> 02:35.041
Baby, you know this is a
blessed house, don't you?

02:35.321 --> 02:37.201
And God does not reject anyone.

02:37.561 --> 02:38.401
I know.

02:38.681 --> 02:42.321
And you know about my
commitment to God and Our Lady

02:42.641 --> 02:43.761
I'm a missionary!

02:44.041 --> 02:44.761
I know, Auntie.

02:45.041 --> 02:47.361
Yesterday I received a call.

02:47.641 --> 02:49.081
A mission.

02:49.921 --> 02:51.281
Oh, Our Lady of Perpetual Help,
how to say...

02:52.161 --> 02:53.041
Okay.

02:53.921 --> 02:56.721
I have a cousin, who has a son.

02:57.521 --> 03:00.321
He's your cousin too,
second or third degree.

03:00.641 --> 03:03.161
And this kid needs to spend
a few days here with us.

03:03.521 --> 03:06.321
Nice!
I didn't know I had a cousin.

03:06.721 --> 03:09.641
And you two can know
each other, be friends.

03:09.921 --> 03:12.201
- Yeah, cool!
- And he'll be here only for a few days

03:12.481 --> 03:13.881
just until things calm down.

03:14.921 --> 03:16.041
What do you mean by calm down?

03:16.481 --> 03:18.841
It seems that they have
some family problems

03:19.241 --> 03:22.081
His stepmother, who is
also a Christian woman

03:22.361 --> 03:24.201
she called me yesterday
in tears.

03:24.481 --> 03:27.361
She said that if the boy comes home,
his father will kill him!

03:28.281 --> 03:30.121
- Wow!
- Yeah, a horrible situation.

03:30.401 --> 03:32.321
And I could not deny
a request from her.

03:33.001 --> 03:36.161
A member of our family,
going through this difficult situation.

03:36.441 --> 03:37.561
I understand, Auntie.
Of course!

03:37.841 --> 03:38.921
His name is Mario.

03:39.361 --> 03:40.681
- Oh, Mario!
- Yes.

03:40.961 --> 03:41.721
Nice.

03:42.001 --> 03:43.761
Oh, I'm glad
you liked it, my dear.

03:44.881 --> 03:47.641
I did not want to bother
you anymore, but

03:47.921 --> 03:49.521
There is an extra bed
in your room.

03:49.801 --> 03:51.721
Oh no, Auntie.
No problem at all.

03:52.001 --> 03:53.521
Ah, that's good, honey!

03:54.081 --> 03:55.721
I'm going to change
the sheets today.

03:56.001 --> 03:58.241
Because he arrives tomorrow.

03:59.281 --> 04:02.641
- Tomorrow.
- Yeah, it was all of a sudden.

04:02.921 --> 04:04.641
And... well.

04:04.921 --> 04:07.641
I have to go to that spiritual retreat
with Father Ulysses, you know.

04:08.121 --> 04:09.641
I will not be here when
he comes.

04:09.921 --> 04:12.241
But I'm sure you'll treat
him like a lord.

04:12.521 --> 04:14.121
And I'll be back in a few days.

04:14.401 --> 04:15.721
All right, Auntie. Do not worry.

04:18.521 --> 04:21.321
And what happened?
Why is his father so angry?

04:21.761 --> 04:25.161
Because the boy is leaving...

04:25.441 --> 04:28.121
From the jail tomorrow, and
the father doesn't want him at home.

04:28.401 --> 04:29.081
Do you believe that?

04:29.361 --> 04:30.241
- From jail?
- Yes.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.161
- From the prison?
- Yes.

04:32.601 --> 04:34.761
But, Auntie?
This guy is not dangerous?

04:35.041 --> 04:36.201
What did he do?
Why was he arrested?

04:36.481 --> 04:38.041
- And I'm going to be alone here with him.
- Honey...

04:38.321 --> 04:40.561
Honey.
I didn't even want to know what he did.

04:40.841 --> 04:43.641
Because forgiveness
is more important than sin.

04:43.921 --> 04:45.961
- No, Auntie, calm down. We have to...
- God...

04:46.801 --> 04:48.921
Bless us.

04:49.321 --> 04:51.361
I know, but it's not better to think...

04:51.641 --> 04:53.241
I'm sure that God

04:53.521 --> 04:55.321
And the Blessed Virgin

04:55.601 --> 04:57.401
Who live in this home

04:57.681 --> 05:00.441
They will transform the heart
of our relative.

05:00.721 --> 05:02.161
But you do not think it's better...

05:02.441 --> 05:05.161
Where God is,
we have protection.

05:16.361 --> 05:18.761
- That's great, huh?
- Yeah. It's really cool.

05:19.601 --> 05:21.601
It will be a few days, honey.

05:22.881 --> 05:25.561
God!
Be in this room

05:25.841 --> 05:27.921
Bless this boy who's coming

05:28.201 --> 05:30.161
Protect my dear nephew

05:32.201 --> 05:33.521
No, Auntie!
Not on the keyboard!

05:33.921 --> 05:36.721
Holy angel of the Lord,
my zealous keeper.

05:40.201 --> 05:43.001
Damn! Come here!
You disgusting!

05:46.481 --> 05:48.121
This one is already in hell.

06:03.241 --> 06:06.841
Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!
You are a great musician.

06:07.161 --> 06:09.481
I'm delighted!
Looks like...

06:10.441 --> 06:12.161
That God plays with you.

06:13.841 --> 06:14.761
Thank you!

06:15.161 --> 06:18.921
You know, I can imagine
as God meticulously did

06:19.201 --> 06:21.401
every little musical note.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.161
Each one more beautiful than the other!

06:24.201 --> 06:25.081
About the class.

06:25.361 --> 06:28.361
I usually teach twice a week,
for each student.

06:28.761 --> 06:32.001
And usually I ask the student
to bring a song...

06:32.281 --> 06:33.361
Can you play this one?

06:37.841 --> 06:40.201
- The Princess of Miracles?
- That's right.

06:40.521 --> 06:41.601
Ok. Let me see.

06:49.281 --> 06:52.601

06:52.881 --> 06:55.841

Glory!

07:24.161 --> 07:26.281
Glory, glory!
Amen!

08:01.441 --> 08:02.361
Dear Lucas,

08:03.081 --> 08:05.721
I did not want to wake you,
you were sleeping like an angel.

08:06.361 --> 08:07.601
I bought many things to eat

08:07.881 --> 08:09.681
And I made a carrot cake,
which is in the oven

08:09.961 --> 08:12.041
I hope you and Mario
get along very well.

08:13.241 --> 08:14.681
I locked my room

08:14.961 --> 08:16.721
The key is under Our Lady,
on top of the refrigerator

08:17.001 --> 08:19.081
If you need it, for some emergency,
it's there.

08:19.681 --> 08:21.561
A big kiss.
I love you.

08:23.321 --> 08:25.841
Can I lock myself in my room,
Aunt? Nice.

08:57.441 --> 08:58.321
Hi!

08:58.881 --> 08:59.681
Hi!

08:59.961 --> 09:01.681
- Oh, you must be...
- Mario!

09:02.201 --> 09:03.281
- Oh, of course.
- Hi cousin!

09:03.561 --> 09:05.081
Hi, Mario! What's up?
Are you all right?

09:05.521 --> 09:07.401
I never knew
that I had a cousin!

09:10.641 --> 09:12.121
My surname is also Hantz!

09:12.401 --> 09:13.401
Oh cool

09:14.121 --> 09:15.001
Another Hantz!

09:16.201 --> 09:17.441
Thanks for receiving me.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.721
It's all right.
This is really cool.

09:20.001 --> 09:21.041
I also didn't know
that I had a cousin

09:22.161 --> 09:24.681
This is for all the years
that we have not hugged

09:26.761 --> 09:27.641
Ah, cousin!

09:30.321 --> 09:31.321
How was your trip here?

09:31.641 --> 09:32.521
Good.

09:33.121 --> 09:33.961
It was quiet.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.761
- Right.
- In fact...

09:36.401 --> 09:37.841
I didn't even notice.

09:38.841 --> 09:40.761
And as you can see,
this place is very calm.

09:41.521 --> 09:42.601
I see. Very peaceful.

09:44.521 --> 09:45.481
Oh, and about the aunt.

09:45.761 --> 09:47.881
She's not here because
she had to travel.

09:48.161 --> 09:49.601
But she apologizes

09:50.361 --> 09:51.801
- About the situation...
- Oh no! It's all right!

09:52.081 --> 09:52.721
- Ok?
- Ok.

09:53.001 --> 09:54.201
Easy, right?
Good!

09:57.001 --> 09:58.801
Let's go?
I can show you the house.

09:59.441 --> 10:00.761
- Let's go in?
- Nice!

10:01.441 --> 10:02.321
Come with me.

10:03.641 --> 10:06.121
As you can see,
the house is very simple but...

10:06.401 --> 10:07.601
That's enough.

10:08.361 --> 10:09.401
This is my...

10:10.241 --> 10:11.361
It's our room now.

10:12.441 --> 10:13.721
Oh, shall we sleep together?

10:14.001 --> 10:15.601
I mean.
In the same room?

10:15.881 --> 10:18.041
- Yes.
- That's cool!

10:19.201 --> 10:20.801
And this house is wonderful.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.361
It's much better than
the place I've been

10:23.641 --> 10:24.801
Sure.

10:25.761 --> 10:27.361
You know where I was,
right cousin?

10:28.281 --> 10:31.481
Ah! I know I know.
- Yeah, cousin.

10:31.841 --> 10:32.841
Jail

10:33.281 --> 10:34.441
The worst place in the world.

10:35.001 --> 10:35.961
I can imagine.

10:37.361 --> 10:38.681
Sleeping with one is easy.

10:39.121 --> 10:40.681
Think about
sleeping with fifteen.

10:43.521 --> 10:44.641
Thanks again for receiving me.

10:44.961 --> 10:46.041
- Oh...
- I do not want to bother you.

10:46.321 --> 10:47.961
Don't worry.
It's all right.

10:48.361 --> 10:50.201
Look, our aunt made
this bed for you.

10:50.481 --> 10:53.081
Not very comfortable, but...
I think you'll like it.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.681
Bullshit.
It's wonderful!

10:57.921 --> 11:00.201
If you tell me you have
a bath in this house

11:00.481 --> 11:01.801
I'll kiss you on the mouth.

11:05.321 --> 11:08.001
Yes, I have.
Come on, I'll show you.

11:08.281 --> 11:09.961
Oh, great!
I need to take a shower.

11:10.241 --> 11:11.601
I get sweaty very quickly.

11:11.881 --> 11:13.881
- Sure. Take your shower.
- Oh cool.

11:15.921 --> 11:19.521
This is the bathroom.
It's very spacious, big.

11:20.841 --> 11:22.041
For hot water

11:22.321 --> 11:23.761
you have to open the tap very slowly

11:24.041 --> 11:25.881
Otherwise it doesn't heat up.

11:26.161 --> 11:27.161
Ok. Great.

11:31.041 --> 11:33.001
Wow, that's delicious.

11:33.641 --> 11:35.321
Very nice.

11:37.961 --> 11:39.081
There's only one bathroom
in the house?

11:39.361 --> 11:41.601
Not! There's another one up there,
in our aunt's bedroom.

11:41.881 --> 11:43.281
It's way better than this one,
as a matter of fact.

11:45.361 --> 11:47.561
And don't worry,
I won't mess anything up.

11:47.841 --> 11:48.921
I will not dirty the house

11:49.281 --> 11:51.481
And I never piss on the toilet seat.

11:52.161 --> 11:53.161
Starting today.

11:53.681 --> 11:55.601
I confess I also forget to pick this up.

11:56.041 --> 11:58.001
But I got much better
after I came to live with my aunt

11:58.281 --> 12:00.281
Because she's a woman. So...

12:03.161 --> 12:04.121
How long do you live here?

12:04.401 --> 12:05.561
Did you come from jail too?

12:05.881 --> 12:07.281
Ah!
No, no!

12:07.561 --> 12:09.241
I came to live here as a child.

12:11.961 --> 12:14.761
My parents passed away
and my aunt supported me.

12:16.081 --> 12:18.881
- My condolences.
- It's all right. I already got over it.

12:21.401 --> 12:22.641
My mother is dead too.

12:25.241 --> 12:26.121
She was an alcoholic.

12:27.041 --> 12:29.121
She drank to forget
my father's beatings.

12:32.161 --> 12:34.601
I forgot some things,
like shampoo, soap.

12:34.881 --> 12:36.201
Can I use yours?

12:36.521 --> 12:38.801
Oh, I have some things here
that I think can help you.

12:39.081 --> 12:40.081
Cool!

12:42.041 --> 12:43.081
Shampoo.

12:44.081 --> 12:45.001
Soap.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.201
Liquid soap.

12:57.921 --> 12:59.041
Lotion.

13:01.041 --> 13:01.961
Nice.

13:02.641 --> 13:03.521
Oh...

13:03.801 --> 13:06.001
So...
I'll leave you alone.

13:06.281 --> 13:07.681
So you can do your thing.

13:07.961 --> 13:08.841
Hey!

13:09.121 --> 13:12.921
- Thank you!
- If you need me, just talk.

13:13.201 --> 13:14.281
Okay.

13:44.601 --> 13:46.681
It's delicious.
Did you cook it?

13:47.441 --> 13:49.001
No, the aunt.
She baked it for us.

13:52.201 --> 13:53.681
Wow! She cooks very well.

13:58.721 --> 14:00.281
Let me clean the dishes later, okay?

14:00.721 --> 14:02.521
Don't worry about it.
You're new here.

14:02.801 --> 14:03.721
No problem.

14:04.321 --> 14:06.361
No, no!
I want to help.

14:07.441 --> 14:08.441
Let me wash it.

14:22.201 --> 14:24.881
I can clean the house too.

14:25.161 --> 14:26.361
I like it.

14:27.961 --> 14:29.321
Okay, we can help
each other out.

14:29.601 --> 14:31.361
If you want,
we can share the tasks.

14:36.201 --> 14:37.521
I know how to cook too.

14:38.121 --> 14:39.561
I know how to cook eggs.

14:47.361 --> 14:49.041
I also know how to iron clothes.

14:59.841 --> 15:01.241
Do you like sucking the bone?

15:05.961 --> 15:06.881
It's good.

16:11.681 --> 16:13.601
This song is good for you
to practice the chords.

16:13.881 --> 16:14.761
Chords?

16:15.721 --> 16:16.601
What is this?

16:17.481 --> 16:18.601
It's a set of notes.

16:18.921 --> 16:20.761
Wow, this is beautiful!

16:21.121 --> 16:21.961
Yeah.

16:22.241 --> 16:23.161
For example.

16:23.681 --> 16:25.161
This is the "A".

16:26.161 --> 16:28.481
Wow!! Wonderful!
How wonderful.

16:29.761 --> 16:30.641
Try.

16:33.601 --> 16:34.681
I can't.

16:36.001 --> 16:36.961
Here.

16:37.921 --> 16:39.281
Put that finger in here.

16:39.561 --> 16:40.961
There.
So you...

16:43.161 --> 16:46.081
Oh, I'm so excited!
My first note!

16:46.361 --> 16:48.041
Did I play perfectly, Professor?

16:49.921 --> 16:51.561
Yeah, I think you should...
I think...

16:51.841 --> 16:54.601
You need to buy a keyboard,
so you can train more at home.

16:54.881 --> 16:55.961
I think it's important.

16:57.841 --> 16:59.321
That boy...

16:59.601 --> 17:01.561
He's your cousin?

17:03.161 --> 17:04.560
Yes, he is.

17:04.961 --> 17:07.401
Nice. And he's going
to live here with you?

17:08.521 --> 17:10.441
No, no. He's only going
to stay here for a while.

17:10.721 --> 17:11.521
Oh, nice.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.601
Does he have that
imposing surname too?

17:16.121 --> 17:17.001
Hantz.

17:18.601 --> 17:19.521
Yes, he has.

17:20.201 --> 17:21.921
Cool!
You know,

17:22.681 --> 17:25.001
I would love to have
that name, Julia Hantz.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.601
Do you want to continue
with the class? Let's go?

17:30.881 --> 17:31.961
Ah yes.

17:51.881 --> 17:53.761
What a cute little hole!

17:59.881 --> 18:01.441
I think the next time you come

18:01.721 --> 18:03.601
You can bring a song
that you like, so we can...

18:03.881 --> 18:04.841
Oh, there's a song...

18:05.121 --> 18:07.481
I did nothing! I'm innocent.
I swear! I swear!

18:09.121 --> 18:11.561
- Wow, I had a nightmare.
- Sorry to wake you, Mario.

18:12.841 --> 18:13.761
Bye!

18:16.281 --> 18:18.481
So I come on Tuesdays
and Thursdays, right, Professor?

18:18.761 --> 18:19.881
Yes!

18:21.441 --> 18:22.161
Bye!

18:32.681 --> 18:34.121
Sorry, Mario.
I didn't want to wake you up, man.

18:34.401 --> 18:36.321
Oh no. It's all right.
It's not time to sleep.

18:39.121 --> 18:40.561
So you give keyboard lessons?

18:40.841 --> 18:43.881
Yes. You will hear a lot
of music from now on.

18:44.161 --> 18:45.881
Nice!
I like music.

18:46.201 --> 18:48.321
Really?
Do you play anything?

19:05.161 --> 19:06.201
You were looking at me?

19:06.801 --> 19:08.881
Not! I was looking
at the window there.

19:10.961 --> 19:11.921
Cousin.

19:12.321 --> 19:14.041
I hear strange noises here.

19:14.761 --> 19:15.641
It's normal?

19:16.041 --> 19:17.961
Yes. It's normal.
They are nocturnal animals.

19:18.401 --> 19:20.921
- There's a forest nearby.
- Oh, thank goodness.

19:22.201 --> 19:24.001
- Good night.
- Good night.

19:39.081 --> 19:41.361
Cousin!
I think I've heard a few steps.

19:42.441 --> 19:43.481
No, Mario. They are just...

19:43.761 --> 19:46.001
It's just the neighborhood talking.
Can you hear?

19:47.961 --> 19:49.401
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

19:50.321 --> 19:51.121
Cousin.

19:51.401 --> 19:53.761
Do you mind if we put
our beds together?

19:54.041 --> 19:55.961
And we sleep hand in hand

19:56.361 --> 19:57.881
I'm afraid of ghosts.

20:00.001 --> 20:02.161
Seriously, Mario?
Afraid of ghosts?

20:03.161 --> 20:04.001
Okay, fine.

20:04.361 --> 20:05.641
Oh cool.

20:25.561 --> 20:26.441
Hi!

20:27.641 --> 20:28.521
Hi!

20:28.921 --> 20:30.081
Do you want some help with lunch?

20:30.721 --> 20:32.361
Oh no. The beans are almost ready.

20:36.401 --> 20:37.321
Want to play cards?

20:38.441 --> 20:39.241
Play cards?

20:39.521 --> 20:40.921
Which game?
I only know how to play "Hole", man.

20:41.361 --> 20:44.161
Oh, great. I love a hole.

20:46.441 --> 20:47.681
Does the joker dirty the canasta?

20:47.961 --> 20:49.281
No. Just the two of different suits.

20:49.881 --> 20:50.761
Ah, ok.

20:52.561 --> 20:54.801
Playing cards was
what I did most in the jail.

20:56.361 --> 20:58.081
Knowing how to spend time is an art.

21:01.721 --> 21:03.081
The secret of happiness

21:03.361 --> 21:04.681
is in the way

21:05.801 --> 21:06.761
you can cheat at life.

21:07.681 --> 21:09.561
Cheat at life.
Great.

21:11.201 --> 21:12.561
Distraction is the secret.

21:19.041 --> 21:20.161
You just can't steal, okay?

21:21.761 --> 21:23.961
- Not good.
- And speaking of stealing

21:24.881 --> 21:26.161
How did you end up in jail anyway?

21:27.761 --> 21:28.721
Ah!

21:29.161 --> 21:30.201
As a drug dealer.

21:35.241 --> 21:36.241
But it was not fair.

21:37.721 --> 21:39.441
The drug I use sometimes

21:39.721 --> 21:41.041
A little bit, it's alcohol.

21:43.881 --> 21:45.761
What happened was

21:46.041 --> 21:47.601
I went to protect a friend of mine.

21:48.761 --> 21:50.121
From an asshole on the street

21:50.401 --> 21:51.281
So

21:52.121 --> 21:54.161
The idiot put drugs in my pocket.

21:54.521 --> 21:55.681
The police came,

21:56.081 --> 21:57.641
found the drug in my pocket.

21:58.601 --> 22:00.521
After explaining the whole story:

22:01.561 --> 22:03.041
Two weeks in jail.

22:04.121 --> 22:05.161
Glad you're free now.

22:05.721 --> 22:06.761
That's it.

22:07.241 --> 22:08.161
Those were bad days.

22:08.801 --> 22:10.521
Think.
Best place in the world.

22:12.041 --> 22:13.161
You've finished?

22:14.121 --> 22:15.281
I distract you with my conversation.

22:15.561 --> 22:17.001
Did not I tell you that
the distraction was the thing?

22:17.281 --> 22:19.721
Of course,
distraction is your thing.

22:21.441 --> 22:22.761
Oh, fuck.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.161
Yeah. Oh!

22:24.881 --> 22:26.081
You can't say dirty words in this house.

22:26.681 --> 22:28.481
He sees everything.

22:30.041 --> 22:30.961
Sorry.

22:31.441 --> 22:33.881
Wow, man.
This game is so fucked...

22:34.561 --> 22:35.521
Sorry.

22:37.041 --> 22:38.921
Yeah. The game
is really hard for you.

22:39.201 --> 22:40.161
Fuck you.

22:43.361 --> 22:44.281
It's just between us.

22:47.521 --> 22:48.561
I think something is missing

22:48.841 --> 22:50.761
Something to encourage
me to win this game.

22:51.281 --> 22:53.161
One thing in the end. Like a gift.

22:54.321 --> 22:55.761
A gift? What gift?

22:56.561 --> 22:58.521
I choose one for you,
and you choose one for me.

23:01.041 --> 23:02.601
You can, like...

23:02.881 --> 23:05.121
Dance to a song. A samba.

23:05.721 --> 23:06.681
Totally naked.

23:07.601 --> 23:08.521
A samba, totally naked?

23:10.361 --> 23:11.601
If I lose, I'll do the same.

23:14.721 --> 23:17.121
No, let it go. Let's keep playing.

23:17.401 --> 23:19.001
Are you afraid to lose, right?

23:19.361 --> 23:21.641
No, no... Never mind, man.

23:25.041 --> 23:26.921
My dream as a child
was to have a Monopoly game.

23:27.881 --> 23:29.321
But everyone was poor where I grew up.

23:30.121 --> 23:33.041
So, me and my friends, we made up games.

23:34.721 --> 23:36.761
Some naughty games...

23:39.401 --> 23:41.361
You know that one?
The "passa carta",

23:41.641 --> 23:43.161
You have to pass the card
to the other's mouth.

23:43.441 --> 23:44.601
Sucking like that.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.521
We played doctor and patient

23:58.801 --> 23:59.921
"Gato Mia".

24:03.361 --> 24:04.641
"Rosca-rosca".

24:05.961 --> 24:07.241
"Queima-queima".

24:09.201 --> 24:10.561
And our parents could not even imagine

24:10.841 --> 24:12.521
we used to do those naughty things...

24:13.201 --> 24:14.161
Yeah.

24:16.921 --> 24:18.321
I just didn't know the "rosca-rosca".

24:18.801 --> 24:21.041
Oh, kid. Just showing it to you.

24:27.961 --> 24:28.841
Only child?

24:29.401 --> 24:30.121
Yes.

24:31.481 --> 24:33.241
You seem to be
a very honest guy.

24:33.521 --> 24:34.561
That's what I am.

24:35.921 --> 24:37.641
- Girlfriend?
- Not for now.

24:38.321 --> 24:39.241
Never dated?

24:39.961 --> 24:41.921
Incredibly, no.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.521
- Gay?
- What?

24:43.801 --> 24:45.881
Or your girlfriend is the shower?

24:51.241 --> 24:54.201
But back to the infamous
child's games.

24:56.641 --> 24:58.281
You're funny, man.

24:59.921 --> 25:02.081
My mind thinks a lot about these things.

25:02.361 --> 25:03.921
Me too.

25:04.321 --> 25:06.201
No, you look like a good boy.

25:06.481 --> 25:07.361
I can see that.

25:07.641 --> 25:08.521
I do?

25:09.161 --> 25:11.401
So I tricked you.

25:11.761 --> 25:14.561
There's a lot of dirt here in my head.

25:17.521 --> 25:18.481
If you say.

25:22.001 --> 25:22.881
Yeah.

25:23.441 --> 25:25.081
So. You know that

25:25.521 --> 25:29.121
these games are common
among cousins, right?

25:29.841 --> 25:31.521
Yeah. Seriously.

25:33.321 --> 25:34.281
I know.

25:35.041 --> 25:35.921
Yeah.

25:37.361 --> 25:38.801
Haven't you heard those stories?

25:41.721 --> 25:42.601
I think so.

25:44.641 --> 25:45.601
Cool.

25:48.401 --> 25:49.321
Yeah.

25:49.721 --> 25:51.441
And now you have a cousin, right?

25:56.321 --> 25:57.921
- The pressure cooker!
- Damn it!

26:01.401 --> 26:03.601
- Oh my god!
- Fuck!

26:04.761 --> 26:05.921
Today we will not eat beans.

26:23.361 --> 26:24.321
Very good.

26:26.881 --> 26:27.881
Do you do anything?

26:29.641 --> 26:30.521
Anything what?

26:31.241 --> 26:32.801
Like, to make money?

26:34.161 --> 26:35.401
Before going to jail

26:36.961 --> 26:39.041
I was like a cashier

26:39.841 --> 26:42.041
in a kind of lottery house.

26:43.081 --> 26:44.681
What do you mean,
what kind of lottery?

26:47.881 --> 26:49.041
Some clandestine games.

26:52.681 --> 26:55.481
But what I really
like to do is draw.

26:57.761 --> 26:59.241
But I do not make money from it yet.

27:01.601 --> 27:02.681
Drawing is cool.

27:03.681 --> 27:04.881
What do you like to draw?

27:07.001 --> 27:08.761
I like to draw comics.

27:09.481 --> 27:10.441
Nice.

27:12.881 --> 27:13.841
Someday I'll show you.

27:14.881 --> 27:15.761
Show me now.

27:17.681 --> 27:18.761
We're here with nothing to do.

27:36.401 --> 27:37.521
Not this one.

27:40.841 --> 27:41.721
Not this.

27:42.001 --> 27:43.121
Can you stop being shy?

27:45.121 --> 27:47.241
You don't show me any music.

27:50.201 --> 27:51.681
Can I see this one?

28:03.121 --> 28:04.081
You're shy.

28:05.281 --> 28:06.361
A little bit.

28:07.721 --> 28:09.081
You don't write dialogue?

28:09.801 --> 28:10.921
I never write.

28:11.201 --> 28:12.161
Need to put some in, right?

28:13.281 --> 28:14.161
Would be nice.

28:14.721 --> 28:15.641
But the drawing is cool.

28:19.921 --> 28:20.761
He looks like you.

28:21.601 --> 28:22.961
By the way.
He is you.

28:25.001 --> 28:25.921
Yeah.

28:26.521 --> 28:28.201
So would you like to have superpowers?

28:28.481 --> 28:29.321
Yes.

28:30.321 --> 28:31.281
Which?

28:32.961 --> 28:34.121
Be invisible.

28:35.881 --> 28:36.801
Fly.

28:38.401 --> 28:39.721
Freeze people.

28:41.761 --> 28:42.921
Freeze people?

28:44.561 --> 28:45.441
Why?

28:45.721 --> 28:47.921
Because it's really cool.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.601
Freeze people
before they reach me.

28:51.881 --> 28:53.401
Before they hurt me.

28:57.201 --> 28:58.441
Interesting.

29:02.801 --> 29:04.521
- What is this?
- I'm freezing you, man.

29:04.801 --> 29:06.001
- Freeze.
- No.

29:06.321 --> 29:07.641
- Freeze.
- Can you stop?

29:11.161 --> 29:12.401
Freeze.

29:19.561 --> 29:21.641
Now come here
and show me your song.

29:21.921 --> 29:22.841
Mario, you kissed me!

29:23.761 --> 29:25.481
Oh yes! Relax.

29:25.761 --> 29:27.641
It's a cousin's kiss.
Very common.

29:28.321 --> 29:29.801
Now come play a song for me.

29:31.441 --> 29:32.841
Come on, Lucas.
I showed you my drawings.

29:33.121 --> 29:34.441
Now you play me a song.

29:35.321 --> 29:36.721
Hurry up.

30:15.081 --> 30:16.641
Are you moved, man?

30:17.761 --> 30:19.841
I think it's very beautiful.

30:20.961 --> 30:22.081
And I thought I'd played it all wrong.

30:22.361 --> 30:24.761
No. You played perfectly.

30:25.561 --> 30:26.601
Thanks!

30:29.881 --> 30:32.681
Is classical music the only one
you like to listen to?

30:33.881 --> 30:35.681
You can go very far with her, you know.

30:37.001 --> 30:39.041
But, there are other
musical styles that I like to hear.

30:39.681 --> 30:41.041
I just can't because my aunt
does not like it very much.

30:44.161 --> 30:45.161
Heavy metal.

30:47.161 --> 30:49.961
And it has to be very loud,
otherwise it's not funny.

31:23.241 --> 31:24.881
Dude, don't call her! It's dawn!

31:25.161 --> 31:25.641
She won't answer.

31:25.921 --> 31:27.401
It's cool, man!

31:27.681 --> 31:29.001
- She's boring.
- Is she really boring?

31:29.281 --> 31:31.361
Yes! She rented this house to us.

31:31.641 --> 31:32.561
- Really?
- Yes.

31:32.961 --> 31:34.041
Check if the number is right.

31:36.241 --> 31:37.161
Yes. It is.

31:37.881 --> 31:38.721
So let's go.

31:40.041 --> 31:40.961
It's calling.

31:42.281 --> 31:43.521
She's going to kill us.

31:48.921 --> 31:51.721
Who is it now?

31:52.401 --> 31:53.641
It's so late.

31:54.481 --> 31:55.281
Hello!

31:56.121 --> 31:59.841
Don't say hello!
Say "pleasure with madness"!

32:00.241 --> 32:01.161
My God!

32:01.441 --> 32:04.121
Are not you ashamed to call
my house late at night?

32:04.401 --> 32:06.561
I'm already an old lady.

32:07.841 --> 32:09.401
It's not a prank, madam.

32:09.681 --> 32:11.881
You are participating
in the promotion

32:12.161 --> 32:14.801
"Pleasure with madness".

32:15.081 --> 32:17.441
But don't be sad, you can win!

32:17.841 --> 32:19.481
I have heart problems, boy!

32:19.961 --> 32:21.481
I'll call the police now!

32:22.241 --> 32:24.281
All you need to do

32:24.921 --> 32:27.441
is say "Pleasure with madness"

32:28.001 --> 32:30.561
Groaning, like a goat!

32:31.321 --> 32:32.481
A goat?

32:34.241 --> 32:36.401
And how is this massage?

32:36.801 --> 32:39.521
Our massage therapist
goes to your room

32:39.801 --> 32:41.401
totally naked.

32:41.681 --> 32:45.481
And massages your whole body.

32:45.761 --> 32:47.561
That way.

32:49.961 --> 32:53.001
And... Where is this motel?

32:53.281 --> 32:54.641
Well, actually I...

32:54.921 --> 32:56.161
I can't go to a motel.

32:56.441 --> 32:59.161
If anyone sees me entering a motel...

33:01.001 --> 33:02.361
It can be in a parking lot.

33:03.441 --> 33:07.241
And it can't be at night.
I always go to bed early.

33:08.561 --> 33:09.841
It could be in the afternoon.

33:10.361 --> 33:11.681
Is that a joke?

33:12.641 --> 33:14.401
Oh, what a pity!

33:19.601 --> 33:20.961
Pleasure

33:21.961 --> 33:23.961
with madness!

33:33.241 --> 33:34.201
Hello.

33:34.881 --> 33:35.841
Hello.

33:39.481 --> 33:41.121
Oh, I can not believe
it was a joke.

33:41.401 --> 33:42.161
Oh, no...

33:43.681 --> 33:45.201
I thought it would be today...

33:47.401 --> 33:48.361
Who knows...

33:49.201 --> 33:50.721
Maybe one day...

35:10.841 --> 35:13.641
Stop being an idiot.

35:15.241 --> 35:17.281
Fuck off.
You're not Renato Russo.

35:21.841 --> 35:23.121
Come on, stop.

35:38.361 --> 35:39.721
I already shut up.

35:41.281 --> 35:42.761
I'll tell you a joke.

35:43.841 --> 35:44.801
Ok.

35:45.441 --> 35:46.921
Tell me the joke.

35:47.761 --> 35:49.681
Look.
Two sisters.

35:50.401 --> 35:53.201
Two sisters.
The youngest and the oldest.

35:54.361 --> 35:56.841
The youngest spoke
to the eldest.

35:57.681 --> 35:58.921
Look sister

35:59.321 --> 36:02.601
It is growing hair
on my little monkey

36:05.201 --> 36:06.641
The older one said

36:07.481 --> 36:08.841
Oh, my dear.

36:09.121 --> 36:11.841
Mine is already eating bananas.

36:14.841 --> 36:16.201
This is your joke.

36:16.761 --> 36:19.561
That...
Holy shit.

36:21.401 --> 36:22.521
What the fuck.

36:23.561 --> 36:25.281
You're really bad with jokes.

36:41.681 --> 36:43.881
Mario.
Wake up!

36:49.961 --> 36:51.001
Mario.

36:52.601 --> 36:53.641
Mario.

36:58.161 --> 36:59.361
Shit.

37:00.721 --> 37:01.801
Sleep well.

37:03.121 --> 37:04.281
It's good.

39:00.601 --> 39:01.521
Good morning.

39:02.841 --> 39:03.761
Good morning.

39:06.201 --> 39:08.041
I'm still laughing
at yesterday's prank, dude.

39:09.321 --> 39:10.361
Are you better?

39:10.681 --> 39:12.681
I didn't even see you
go to bed yesterday. I fell asleep.

39:13.601 --> 39:14.561
I don't remember either.

39:16.681 --> 39:18.241
Yeah. You were naked.

39:19.281 --> 39:21.521
Ah yes. Don't you remember?

39:22.681 --> 39:24.081
What have we done?

39:24.761 --> 39:27.561
You having any trouble sitting down?

39:28.841 --> 39:31.641
Oh God. Don't say that sort of thing...

39:33.081 --> 39:34.441
I'm joking.

39:34.721 --> 39:36.681
I always take off
my clothes to sleep.

39:38.601 --> 39:39.721
What a fright.

39:42.201 --> 39:43.481
- What are you reading there?
- But I wanted it.

39:43.761 --> 39:44.481
What?

39:44.761 --> 39:45.921
I said and ran.

39:48.921 --> 39:49.801
Sucker.

39:52.681 --> 39:54.281
The title is "The Goofy Bird."

39:55.921 --> 39:57.081
What a fucking title

39:57.761 --> 39:58.961
I took this book from prison.

39:59.641 --> 40:00.561
It's good?

40:00.921 --> 40:02.641
It's great!
It has many illustrations.

40:03.561 --> 40:05.201
Edgar turns into a bird

40:05.481 --> 40:07.121
People are disgusted,
but he's a superhero.

40:07.401 --> 40:08.241
Like Jesus.

40:10.001 --> 40:10.881
Cool.

40:11.481 --> 40:12.921
Was that a kind of catch game?

40:14.201 --> 40:15.441
I'm like that bird.

40:16.601 --> 40:17.761
Are you religious?

40:19.321 --> 40:20.401
I believe in something.

40:21.961 --> 40:22.881
Is that good?

40:24.081 --> 40:25.441
I believe in the mystery.

40:26.481 --> 40:28.401
So you do not believe
in a specific God?

40:29.841 --> 40:30.961
I feel God.

40:31.561 --> 40:33.041
But I can not tell what he looks like.

40:34.121 --> 40:35.481
I hope our aunt doesn't hear me, but

40:35.841 --> 40:37.041
I believe this too.

40:40.001 --> 40:42.201
Do you believe in sin?

40:44.241 --> 40:45.241
No.

40:47.281 --> 40:48.281
Take off your clothes.

41:07.161 --> 41:08.361
And the underwear, too.

41:19.281 --> 41:20.441
Did you hear that?

41:21.041 --> 41:22.201
Sounds like steps.

41:24.681 --> 41:26.041
Son of a bitch.

41:52.481 --> 41:54.201
I'll have my revenge.

41:54.601 --> 41:56.401
I'll get your underwear, too.

41:56.681 --> 41:59.081
I'm going to put
your underwear on that tree too.

42:01.561 --> 42:03.321
I'll take off
your underwear now.

42:05.281 --> 42:07.201
Don't hide.

42:08.081 --> 42:09.721
I'll find you, Lucas.

42:11.641 --> 42:13.161
I'll find you.

42:23.121 --> 42:25.001
I'll get you, Lucas.

42:25.481 --> 42:27.481
You will not escape

42:30.081 --> 42:31.641
Are you listening, Lucas?

42:34.281 --> 42:35.641
Lucas.

42:49.401 --> 42:51.401
I said I'd get you, Lucas.

42:54.841 --> 42:56.121
You do not have
to take off my underwear.

42:56.401 --> 42:57.481
I already did.

42:58.761 --> 43:00.281
I'm crazy for you.

43:37.161 --> 43:39.321
- I'm here for class.
- Julia!

43:40.081 --> 43:42.361
- Your class is at five o'clock.
- Oh, really?

43:42.641 --> 43:44.161
Yes. And it's still...

43:44.681 --> 43:45.361
One-thirty.

43:45.641 --> 43:49.041
Ah, then in three hours and...

43:50.761 --> 43:52.681
- And thirty minutes I'll be back.
- Fine.

43:52.961 --> 43:54.721
- Bye.
- Bye. See you later.

43:57.201 --> 43:58.121
Did she see us?

43:58.401 --> 44:00.161
I think she saw your...

44:03.281 --> 44:06.201
Now she's going home
to play keyboard.

44:06.481 --> 44:07.841
Oh my God.

44:08.521 --> 44:09.521
Now come here.

45:27.881 --> 45:30.081
This one also has
that beautiful D

45:30.361 --> 45:31.481
that you did that day.

45:31.761 --> 45:33.641
D!

45:35.481 --> 45:36.881
I think we can continue.

45:48.201 --> 45:49.641
- Julia! Julia!
- What?

45:50.481 --> 45:51.441
Are you okay?

45:52.521 --> 45:55.041
- You touched my...
- Your what, Lucas?

45:55.321 --> 45:56.361
I don't understand.

45:56.641 --> 45:57.801
You touched my dick, Julia.

45:58.081 --> 45:59.601
Your penis?

46:00.041 --> 46:01.361
Yes, Julia. My penis.

46:01.641 --> 46:03.721
No. I think you're wrong, Lucas.

46:04.001 --> 46:05.121
My God. No.

46:06.881 --> 46:08.401
Let's go honey. Keep playing.

46:18.121 --> 46:20.361
This girl is crazy. For God's sake.

46:41.681 --> 46:43.081
What is it?

46:44.561 --> 46:46.361
You can't see my drawings.

46:47.641 --> 46:49.521
OK. Are you sleepy?

46:54.401 --> 46:55.601
Let's go to sleep?

46:56.361 --> 46:57.881
I have to check the gate first.

47:06.601 --> 47:07.521
Mario?

49:57.281 --> 49:59.921
So beautiful the affection
among the cousins.

50:02.801 --> 50:05.241
I'm glad they understand each other.
Our Lady of Lourdes.

50:47.961 --> 50:49.921
What a boring trip.
Fuck.

50:52.641 --> 50:53.801
Oh, I'm sorry.

52:14.481 --> 52:16.841
You woke up.

52:21.121 --> 52:23.481
Thank you Lord, for this meal

52:23.881 --> 52:27.041
And because we're
together at this table

52:27.321 --> 52:29.521
On this beautiful sunny morning. Amen.

52:29.801 --> 52:31.481
- Amen.
- Amen.

52:32.441 --> 52:34.761
You don't know the joy I felt

52:35.041 --> 52:36.561
arriving here yesterday
and seeing you both

52:36.841 --> 52:38.081
cousins of the same blood

52:38.361 --> 52:41.081
in a gesture of fraternization,
sleeping together.

52:41.921 --> 52:43.321
What happened, dear?

52:44.841 --> 52:47.521
Auntie, I'm sorry.
We were...

52:47.801 --> 52:49.401
Watching a horror movie, Auntie.

52:49.801 --> 52:51.201
Lucas is very fearful.

52:51.481 --> 52:53.641
He really is. Since he was little,
he wanted to sleep with me.

52:53.921 --> 52:55.201
He was afraid of ghosts.

52:55.481 --> 52:57.321
Yes aunt.
The movie was very scary.

52:57.601 --> 52:58.441
Yeah.

52:59.721 --> 53:01.401
But did Lucas treat you well, dear?

53:01.681 --> 53:03.761
Very well, Auntie.

53:04.121 --> 53:05.681
He's kind of clumsy, you know.

53:05.961 --> 53:06.841
Clumsy?

53:07.921 --> 53:09.481
He blew out the pressure cooker.

53:09.761 --> 53:11.041
Mercy!

53:12.241 --> 53:15.601
Auntie, I want to thank you
for receiving me so well.

53:16.081 --> 53:17.241
I told Lucas

53:17.521 --> 53:20.281
You can count on me
to help with whatever it takes.

53:20.561 --> 53:22.401
Yes. And he was very good.
Helped me cut the plants.

53:22.681 --> 53:24.401
- He helped me in the kitchen too.
- Really?

53:25.081 --> 53:27.481
I even want to help with the bills.

53:28.721 --> 53:31.081
Honey. You are a guest here.

53:31.361 --> 53:33.281
Guest, like...
Temporary guest.

53:33.561 --> 53:36.281
Just for a while. So you
don't have to worry about that.

53:36.561 --> 53:38.441
Right, Lucas?

53:38.721 --> 53:40.641
Yes, Auntie.
Yes it is.

53:40.921 --> 53:43.001
But thank you anyway.

53:58.241 --> 54:00.001
Isn't it better to stay in the lottery?

54:00.281 --> 54:01.641
No! No lottery.

54:10.041 --> 54:11.961
I'm coming!

54:17.921 --> 54:20.601
Oh, the son of the lady...

54:20.881 --> 54:23.001
Lourdes.
Hi, Mr. Emilio. How do you do?

54:23.281 --> 54:24.921
All right, boy.
What do you want?

54:25.401 --> 54:27.921
This is Mario, he's spending
some time at home

54:28.201 --> 54:30.121
And he walks with dogs,
so I thought

54:30.401 --> 54:32.361
- Bring him here to see you...
- Every day...

54:32.641 --> 54:35.241
In the afternoons, ok?
Frank needs to run.

54:35.521 --> 54:38.121
And he really likes to run.
Right, baby?

54:38.401 --> 54:41.921
Let's do this?
I pay fifty a day.

54:42.201 --> 54:43.961
On even days

54:44.241 --> 54:47.081
And don't be late.

54:47.441 --> 54:48.361
And.

54:48.641 --> 54:50.401
This dog is all I have in my life.

54:50.681 --> 54:52.721
If he gets lost or gets run over

54:53.001 --> 54:54.601
I'll rip your balls.

54:55.561 --> 54:56.801
Go with your friend, go.

54:57.761 --> 54:58.761
Hi, Frank!

54:59.281 --> 55:01.121
Let's go for a walk, Frank?

55:02.881 --> 55:04.721
Let's walk Frank.

55:06.281 --> 55:09.361
Are you ready for the best days
of your life, on my side?

55:09.641 --> 55:11.441
- Come on, Frank!
- I want to see you take care of this dog.

55:11.721 --> 55:13.361
You'll see, he'll love me.

55:13.721 --> 55:15.121
He already loves his friend Mario.

55:37.801 --> 55:39.881
You're the king of the world, Frank.

56:09.761 --> 56:12.281
Hey, Lucas.
Did you want to have a dog?

56:15.801 --> 56:16.681
Lucas.

56:29.921 --> 56:31.121
Lucas. Did you want
to have a dog?

56:31.881 --> 56:33.641
Ah yes.
I do.

56:33.961 --> 56:34.801
It's cute, right?

56:35.361 --> 56:37.281
Let's go?
Shall we go, Frank?

56:37.921 --> 56:38.921
Let's go home?

56:39.481 --> 56:40.401
Let's go?

57:37.121 --> 57:38.081
It's nice.

57:39.401 --> 57:40.161
Thanks.

57:40.761 --> 57:42.721
But I look good anyway, right?

57:43.001 --> 57:45.161
I know, Sonia. Just a little while longer.

57:45.921 --> 57:48.281
Please.
I'll pay it off!

57:49.121 --> 57:51.921
No, no!
I'm not deadbeat.

57:53.201 --> 57:55.201
Do you know.
I am a woman blessed by God.

57:55.481 --> 57:58.201
I have been praying to St. Rita

57:58.521 --> 57:59.761
I'll find a way.

58:01.281 --> 58:05.201
Sonia, please. I only ask you
a little more patience. Please!

58:08.121 --> 58:09.321
Did you hear that?

58:09.641 --> 58:10.521
I heard.

58:10.801 --> 58:13.561
The aunt owes a lot of rent.
Many months.

58:16.361 --> 58:18.161
Why didn't she pay the rent?

58:19.281 --> 58:21.001
She retired due to spinal problems, right?

58:21.281 --> 58:23.601
Last year, they called her for a review

58:23.881 --> 58:25.681
And she lost her retirement.

58:51.681 --> 58:52.641
Auntie Lourdes

58:52.921 --> 58:55.161
From now on,
I'll help pay the rent.

58:55.521 --> 58:56.481
Mario.

59:24.081 --> 59:25.521
Thank you, my dear.

59:26.401 --> 59:27.721
Auntie Lourdes.

59:30.481 --> 59:32.561
I'm getting some money

59:32.841 --> 59:34.561
for walking Emilio's dog.

59:36.121 --> 59:37.841
And there are two other neighbors wanting.

59:39.801 --> 59:42.601
I know you do not want me
to stay here for long.

59:43.121 --> 59:45.561
But as long as I get this money

59:45.921 --> 59:47.321
I'll give it to you.

59:47.681 --> 59:49.761
And in a short time
this debt will end.

59:51.601 --> 59:53.481
You brought joy to this house.

59:54.441 --> 59:57.361
You brought life to Lucas.

59:57.961 --> 59:59.961
It's changed since you got here.

01:00:00.241 --> 01:00:01.441
He's happy.

01:00:02.161 --> 01:00:03.121
He was...

01:00:03.641 --> 01:00:05.241
He was so bored.

01:00:07.921 --> 01:00:09.001
He...

01:00:10.761 --> 01:00:12.921
He missed a friend.

01:00:14.321 --> 01:00:15.681
Thank you, my son!

01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:18.121
Thank you.

01:00:18.521 --> 01:00:20.001
Auntie Lourdes.

01:00:24.881 --> 01:00:26.601
It will be all right, Aunt Lourdes.

01:00:30.161 --> 01:00:31.961
Please, do not cry.

01:00:41.201 --> 01:00:46.561
Look who's here for
another night of adventures.

01:00:47.281 --> 01:00:48.441
Did you lock the door, Mr. Bunny?

01:00:51.841 --> 01:00:52.921
Now yes!

01:00:54.001 --> 01:00:55.761
This bunny looks very happy.

01:00:56.041 --> 01:00:57.201
Do you have good news?

01:00:57.561 --> 01:00:59.161
- You have?
- Very good news.

01:00:59.441 --> 01:01:00.481
What good news?

01:01:00.761 --> 01:01:04.241
Aunt Lourdes told me
very cute things.

01:01:04.521 --> 01:01:06.681
I think I'll stay a while longer

01:01:06.961 --> 01:01:09.561
Here in the trunk of this tree
with this bunny.

01:01:09.841 --> 01:01:11.681
Good news, my rabbit!

01:01:11.961 --> 01:01:13.521
So we have to celebrate, right?

01:01:13.801 --> 01:01:15.601
- Yes.
- You want to see the bunny's jump?

01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:17.361
- I do.
- Want to see?

01:01:19.201 --> 01:01:20.521
Now he's going to jump.

01:01:20.921 --> 01:01:22.441
One...

01:01:23.201 --> 01:01:24.721
Two...

01:01:25.001 --> 01:01:26.041
Bunny! Bunny!

01:01:27.001 --> 01:01:27.961
Julia!

01:01:28.921 --> 01:01:31.521
- What are you doing here?
- It's "Cosme and Damiao"!

01:01:31.841 --> 01:01:32.961
Do you have candy for me?

01:01:33.241 --> 01:01:35.081
"Cosme and Damiao"?
It's next month.

01:01:35.361 --> 01:01:36.441
- You swear?
- Yes!

01:01:36.721 --> 01:01:38.481
God, I'm crazy!

01:01:39.041 --> 01:01:41.321
Ah, then...
I'll be back next month!

01:01:41.601 --> 01:01:42.921
OK.
Good evening, Julia.

01:01:47.481 --> 01:01:49.841
Lucas. This girl is crazy.

01:02:10.041 --> 01:02:12.841
Oh, Lucas. You didn't
take care of it here, did you?

01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:15.481
I can't travel...

01:02:54.641 --> 01:02:56.081
Sons of the devil!

01:02:56.361 --> 01:02:58.321
Aunt Lourdes
will know everything!

01:02:58.601 --> 01:02:59.521
She will know.

01:02:59.801 --> 01:03:01.801
Everyone will know.
The whole city.

01:03:02.081 --> 01:03:04.121
You damn faggots!

01:03:08.881 --> 01:03:09.841
My God!

01:03:10.121 --> 01:03:11.121
Our Lady!

01:03:13.961 --> 01:03:15.081
What was that noise?

01:03:15.401 --> 01:03:16.761
Oh, I don't know...
It must have been a jackdaw.

01:03:25.921 --> 01:03:27.241
Sweetie.

01:03:27.601 --> 01:03:29.601
I feel like Auntie Lourdes is
so alone, you know?

01:03:30.001 --> 01:03:31.561
She was always alone.

01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:34.001
I think I have an idea.

01:03:34.401 --> 01:03:35.361
What idea?

01:03:36.441 --> 01:03:37.601
Mr. Emilio?

01:03:41.801 --> 01:03:43.881
Oh my God.
Can I participate?

01:04:45.201 --> 01:04:46.801
Looks like I'm going to win
this game, right?

01:04:47.841 --> 01:04:49.961
Lucas. We will not lose again.

01:04:50.801 --> 01:04:52.321
Oh, boys.

01:04:52.601 --> 01:04:55.801
I think the old guard
will give you a show.

01:04:56.081 --> 01:04:57.761
Oh, I did not mean
to offend you. Mr Emilio.

01:04:58.081 --> 01:05:00.201
Don't worry, Dona Lourdes.
You're right.

01:05:00.801 --> 01:05:02.441
We are a perfect pair.

01:05:02.721 --> 01:05:05.041
Yes. I think we really are.
Look that!

01:05:05.321 --> 01:05:07.161
- I quit.
- Oh, girl!

01:05:07.441 --> 01:05:08.841
You're very good.

01:05:09.201 --> 01:05:10.681
Oh, thank you, Emilio.

01:05:11.201 --> 01:05:12.161
Well.

01:05:12.641 --> 01:05:15.441
It was a pleasure to play with you.

01:05:16.081 --> 01:05:17.481
Thanks for the invite, son.

01:05:17.761 --> 01:05:20.081
But wait, Emilio.
There's a pizza in the oven.

01:05:20.361 --> 01:05:21.761
Yes. And the night
is just beginning.

01:05:22.041 --> 01:05:23.921
- Exactly.
- Well, if you say so.

01:05:24.201 --> 01:05:25.441
Shall we have some fun?

01:05:26.001 --> 01:05:28.561
That's it!
Lucas, pick a song to play?

01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:29.521
How about wine?

01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:31.441
Do you have wine?
Look, if you don't, no problem.

01:05:31.721 --> 01:05:32.401
I can get some at my house.

01:05:32.681 --> 01:05:34.561
Are you trying to get drunk?

01:05:34.841 --> 01:05:36.641
This is a house of God.
You know.

01:05:36.921 --> 01:05:38.961
Oh aunt, let's drink a little.
It will not hurt anyone.

01:05:39.241 --> 01:05:41.121
Yes, Auntie. And Jesus
multiplied wine too.

01:05:41.721 --> 01:05:43.001
But he only multiplied the bread.

01:05:43.521 --> 01:05:44.481
- The bread?
- Yes.

01:05:44.961 --> 01:05:46.921
Yes, but he drank wine
at Last Supper too.

01:05:47.721 --> 01:05:48.681
It is true.

01:05:49.361 --> 01:05:51.241
Oh, OK.
You convinced me.

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.641
I have some bottles
in the pantry

01:05:54.161 --> 01:05:56.281
But it has to be replaced later,
because the priest uses it in the church.

01:05:57.121 --> 01:05:58.361
Oh, for God's sake.

01:06:06.401 --> 01:06:07.641
Isn't it delicious?

01:06:08.121 --> 01:06:09.441
It's fucking good...
Oops.

01:06:09.721 --> 01:06:12.441
Lourdes. You are like me.

01:06:13.441 --> 01:06:14.601
May I have a dance?

01:06:17.681 --> 01:06:19.161
It's just that I don't know,
like this... to dance.

01:06:21.721 --> 01:06:23.801
Oh, Mrs. Lourdes!

01:06:40.281 --> 01:06:42.561
It's very funny to see
Aunt Lourdes like this.

01:06:42.841 --> 01:06:44.001
She's so happy.

01:06:48.041 --> 01:06:49.121
I love you, you know that?

01:06:53.361 --> 01:06:54.521
I don't want you to leave.

01:06:55.561 --> 01:06:56.521
Ever.

01:06:58.121 --> 01:07:00.201
Will you hide me under your bed?

01:07:01.441 --> 01:07:02.321
Yes.

01:07:02.841 --> 01:07:04.161
Where I can hide.

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:06.921
You've changed a lot in this house.

01:07:08.281 --> 01:07:09.641
You've changed us all.

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:09.041
You're there, boy!

01:08:09.321 --> 01:08:10.481
I didn't seen you.

01:08:10.761 --> 01:08:13.001
No, Auntie.
Don't take it off.

01:08:13.521 --> 01:08:14.801
You look beautiful with makeup.

01:08:15.201 --> 01:08:17.600
- What nonsense.
- It is true!

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.761
- Let me do it for you.
- You? And you know how to makeup?

01:08:22.761 --> 01:08:23.881
I rock.

01:08:25.161 --> 01:08:27.161
- Ok.
- Do it like this.

01:08:28.281 --> 01:08:29.161
Like this.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.201
You'll look even more beautiful.
You will see.

01:08:35.961 --> 01:08:38.680
Hey, Auntie. Emilio is such
good people. Don't you think?

01:08:38.961 --> 01:08:41.520
Oh boy. don't say it...

01:08:41.801 --> 01:08:43.761
Look in the mirror.
Give me a smile.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.881
See how beautiful you look!

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:24.201
You will love your neighbor

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:27.961
as yourself.
Do well.

01:09:28.441 --> 01:09:29.321
Amen.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.600
Amen.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.321
Let's end with the
powerful prayer of Our Lady

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.121
to reach our graces.

01:09:36.401 --> 01:09:38.801
Someone wants to dedicate this
prayer to some...

01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:41.041
Lourdes.

01:09:41.321 --> 01:09:44.481
What did you do with
your hair, my rose?

01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:48.441
Do you like it?
Mario did it, my nephew.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.680
Pardon.

01:09:54.401 --> 01:09:56.921
Hail Mary, full of grace

01:09:57.201 --> 01:09:59.601
Ms. Sonia, can you tell me
what time it is, please?

01:10:07.441 --> 01:10:09.361
Wait. Where's my cell phone?

01:10:11.401 --> 01:10:13.681
My cell phone disappeared.

01:10:13.961 --> 01:10:14.841
What do you mean, disappeared?

01:10:15.121 --> 01:10:16.521
I was just using it.

01:10:20.441 --> 01:10:21.921
Someone stole my cell phone.

01:10:23.401 --> 01:10:24.881
Someone stole my cell phone.

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:28.601
It was with me here
and now it's not.

01:10:28.961 --> 01:10:30.441
Didn't you leave it at home?

01:10:31.801 --> 01:10:33.041
I just got it.

01:10:33.321 --> 01:10:34.721
I just said that.

01:10:35.081 --> 01:10:37.601
Someone stole my cell phone.

01:10:38.361 --> 01:10:40.321
How absurd.

01:10:40.681 --> 01:10:42.921
Sonia, this is a very serious charge.

01:10:43.361 --> 01:10:45.481
Did you go to the bathroom? The kitchen?

01:10:46.481 --> 01:10:49.281
I didn't take my butt
off this chair.

01:10:49.641 --> 01:10:51.601
I can hardly walk, Lourdes.

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:54.601
I bet I know where
your cell phone is, Mrs. Sonia.

01:10:54.881 --> 01:10:55.881
In his things.

01:10:56.641 --> 01:10:58.601
Did you know that this boy,
who is here among us

01:10:58.881 --> 01:11:00.481
is an ex-convict?

01:11:00.761 --> 01:11:01.721
No! This is a lie!

01:11:02.001 --> 01:11:02.841
Julia, how can you say that?

01:11:03.121 --> 01:11:04.121
I'm not inventing anything.

01:11:04.401 --> 01:11:07.121
It's very simple. Look him
up online. Mario Hantz.

01:11:07.401 --> 01:11:11.081
H - A - N - T - Z

01:11:11.361 --> 01:11:12.081
Hantz.

01:11:12.361 --> 01:11:14.921
He was...
He was arrested by mistake, Julia.

01:11:15.961 --> 01:11:17.921
- I'm lying, Mario?
- Julia, please calm down.

01:11:18.201 --> 01:11:20.121
- I'll get you a glass of water...
- No, Auntie. Stay.

01:11:20.801 --> 01:11:23.601
You need to know what
is happening inside your home.

01:11:23.881 --> 01:11:26.481
And it does not end there.
I discovered something else.

01:11:26.761 --> 01:11:28.681
I want my cell phone.

01:11:29.241 --> 01:11:31.001
I just barely paid it off.

01:11:31.281 --> 01:11:32.641
Do you want to find your
cell phone, Ms. Sonia?

01:11:34.641 --> 01:11:35.481
Come with me.

01:11:36.361 --> 01:11:37.881
Oh, I want my cell phone.

01:11:51.881 --> 01:11:53.121
You'll find my cell phone?

01:11:55.161 --> 01:11:56.681
Julia, please.
Don't do it.

01:11:56.961 --> 01:11:58.201
This girl is crazy.
This is absurd.

01:11:58.481 --> 01:11:59.401
Where is his backpack?

01:11:59.681 --> 01:12:00.721
That's it.

01:12:01.921 --> 01:12:02.841
God is with me.

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:05.441
And if I'm wrong, God can punish me.

01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:10.161
Did not I tell you?
The proof of the crime.

01:12:10.721 --> 01:12:11.641
Case closed.

01:12:11.921 --> 01:12:13.681
Obviously she put it in my backpack
when she went to the bathroom.

01:12:13.961 --> 01:12:16.801
You're a bad guy,
and now everybody knows.

01:12:17.281 --> 01:12:18.601
Son, did you get this cell phone?

01:12:18.881 --> 01:12:20.641
Auntie, of course she put
the cell phone in his backpack.

01:12:21.361 --> 01:12:23.481
I can be many things.
But I'm not a thief.

01:12:24.281 --> 01:12:26.481
Oh, I know. Auntie, does your
cell phone have a security lock?

01:12:26.761 --> 01:12:28.041
- He has.
- Excuse.

01:12:28.961 --> 01:12:30.521
Probably the thief tried
to unlock the cell phone

01:12:30.801 --> 01:12:32.401
So, his picture will be here.

01:12:34.001 --> 01:12:34.881
And like I said.

01:12:35.961 --> 01:12:37.201
I just did it.

01:12:37.481 --> 01:12:39.401
You see. I just tried
to unlock the phone.

01:12:39.681 --> 01:12:41.121
Girl, do not do this.

01:12:43.361 --> 01:12:44.921
Fine. It's all right.

01:12:45.201 --> 01:12:48.401
You may not believe me,
even though I'm not lying.

01:12:48.921 --> 01:12:49.721
You know that.

01:12:50.001 --> 01:12:52.961
But I would not leave
my things here in this house.

01:12:53.721 --> 01:12:54.841
And there's more, Aunt Lourdes.

01:12:55.321 --> 01:12:56.761
He besides being a bandit

01:12:57.281 --> 01:12:59.481
he is a devil, who has
defiled your house.

01:12:59.761 --> 01:13:03.441
Because he and Lucas had sex!
They had sex with each other!

01:13:04.921 --> 01:13:06.921
I saw everything.
There at the waterfall.

01:13:07.681 --> 01:13:11.921
Unfortunately I didn't report
this because I was so...

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:16.041
so shocked that the only thing
I could do was walk away.

01:13:21.641 --> 01:13:25.401
- I'm "pleplexed".
- You say perplexed. Perplexed.

01:13:25.681 --> 01:13:26.761
Is that a lie, Mario?

01:13:27.041 --> 01:13:29.521
Are you going to deny that you
and Lucas were fucking at the waterfall?

01:13:36.521 --> 01:13:38.761
All this just because
he didn't want you?

01:13:39.161 --> 01:13:41.081
Answer Mario!

01:13:42.641 --> 01:13:44.441
Are you going to deny it, cousins?

01:13:49.201 --> 01:13:53.601
Didn't I tell you? Those two little holes,
that only a faggot uses...

01:14:02.321 --> 01:14:03.681
Sorry, Lucas.

01:14:05.401 --> 01:14:06.761
Sorry, Auntie Lourdes.

01:14:07.721 --> 01:14:09.481
- I'm leaving.
- No, Mario!

01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:16.441
You know, you bunch of old gossipers

01:14:16.721 --> 01:14:19.001
I'm tired of you!
You're going to hell!

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:20.921
Forgive me, Lord.

01:14:21.681 --> 01:14:22.921
Dear

01:14:23.601 --> 01:14:24.921
I always knew.

01:14:25.601 --> 01:14:27.761
Since I've seen you
sleeping together, but...

01:14:28.361 --> 01:14:29.961
It's not my business.

01:14:31.281 --> 01:14:33.001
And you are so good for each other.

01:14:33.761 --> 01:14:35.241
I see love in you.

01:14:35.881 --> 01:14:37.801
And I interpret the Bible literally

01:14:38.081 --> 01:14:39.961
and the Bible says that God is love.

01:14:40.321 --> 01:14:41.761
And if you love each other

01:14:42.161 --> 01:14:44.201
you are in the arms of God.

01:14:46.641 --> 01:14:47.961
So you always knew?

01:14:48.321 --> 01:14:50.161
Of course yes!
Do you think I'm silly?

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:53.881
Thank you Aunt!

01:14:55.081 --> 01:14:58.721
But I want you and this troupe of demons

01:14:59.001 --> 01:15:00.401
out of my house today.

01:15:00.681 --> 01:15:02.041
Not one more day.

01:15:03.281 --> 01:15:04.961
Look, Sonia. With pleasure.

01:15:06.281 --> 01:15:09.081
This house has a heavy energy.

01:15:09.761 --> 01:15:11.561
It's true. This place sucks.

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:13.201
Even prison is better.

01:15:14.481 --> 01:15:15.841
And my house is pretty big.

01:15:16.121 --> 01:15:18.401
Me and Frank would love the company.

01:15:19.001 --> 01:15:21.081
Great. We already have a roof.

01:15:21.721 --> 01:15:23.001
Lourdes.

01:15:23.281 --> 01:15:25.841
You'll burn in the fire of hell.

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:27.721
Not another day.

01:15:28.321 --> 01:15:29.641
Let's go, girls.

01:15:29.921 --> 01:15:32.961
Before we fall into this portal to hell

01:15:33.241 --> 01:15:35.041
that these immoral opened.

01:15:38.241 --> 01:15:40.041
And your hair.

01:15:40.481 --> 01:15:41.441
I like it.

01:15:42.681 --> 01:15:43.881
Let's go, girls.

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:50.001
Julia.

01:15:53.561 --> 01:15:55.001
I was like you.

01:15:55.721 --> 01:15:57.881
Don't expect to grow old to break free.

01:15:58.961 --> 01:16:01.481
The world can make us very bitter.

01:16:02.881 --> 01:16:05.521
Do you want some advice? Have sex.

01:16:06.481 --> 01:16:07.841
I'm not the right guy for you.

01:16:08.681 --> 01:16:09.761
I like Mario.

01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:12.321
You just thought I was
the right guy because

01:16:12.681 --> 01:16:13.841
I was a man of God.

01:16:14.641 --> 01:16:16.441
But you did not even know me.

01:16:16.721 --> 01:16:17.881
You did not even want to date me.

01:16:18.481 --> 01:16:20.641
You just wanted sex.

01:16:21.561 --> 01:16:23.721
And it's okay!
You can have sex.

01:16:24.521 --> 01:16:25.761
By the way, you should have sex.

01:16:26.841 --> 01:16:29.081
And you don't need revenge on anyone.

01:16:29.481 --> 01:16:32.521
Don't believe this little world
they invented for us.

01:16:33.561 --> 01:16:35.281
Would you like a beer?
With us?

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:46.641
You arrived!

01:16:47.081 --> 01:16:49.441
Come in.
The house is yours now.

01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:52.761
Hi dear!

01:16:53.161 --> 01:16:54.041
Want help with your bag?

01:16:54.321 --> 01:16:57.001
Oh I'm a woman who needs help?

01:16:58.241 --> 01:16:59.921
Oh, he's wonderful!

01:17:00.201 --> 01:17:02.081
Aunt, I never thought you would
accept the fact that I'm gay.

01:17:02.361 --> 01:17:04.001
Oh. You're so silly.

01:17:04.281 --> 01:17:06.321
Thank God you're not homophobic, Emilio.

01:17:06.601 --> 01:17:09.481
Homophobic? Oh, I'll tell you something.

01:17:09.761 --> 01:17:11.881
Frank just likes to ride on male dogs.

01:17:13.281 --> 01:17:15.401
And I love that dog more than myself!

01:17:22.241 --> 01:17:25.041
- How about picnicking in the yard today?
- Great, I make sandwiches!

01:17:29.161 --> 01:17:30.721
What a cool house.
