WEBVTT

00:11.500 --> 00:13.800
Ooh! Uh, Captain,
do you have a minute?

00:13.900 --> 00:14.900
Just about a minute.

00:14.900 --> 00:16.000
I'm on my way
to the shuttIe bay.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.100
I thought Iast night
went weII, didn't you?

00:18.200 --> 00:19.300
ExtremeIy weII.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.500
Everyone had a Iot of fun.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.800
I was thinking of making it
a reguIar feature--

00:22.800 --> 00:24.100
say, uh, once a month?

00:24.100 --> 00:25.500
It's certainIy worth a try.

00:25.500 --> 00:28.800
And, Captain, you were
especiaIIy good Iast night.

00:28.800 --> 00:29.800
Thanks, NeeIix.

00:29.800 --> 00:30.800
It's been a whiIe.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.400
You'd never know.

00:32.400 --> 00:36.400
Uh, Captain, um,
do you think, I mean,

00:36.400 --> 00:39.300
uh, I-I-I-I was wondering...

00:39.300 --> 00:40.800
What is it, NeeIix?

00:40.800 --> 00:43.100
CouId you possibIy
keep Mr. Tuvok busy

00:43.100 --> 00:44.400
on the Bridge that evening?

00:45.600 --> 00:47.900
I'm sure something
couId be arranged.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.600
Our secret, NeeIix.

00:49.700 --> 00:51.500
We never had this discussion.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

01:04.300 --> 01:06.800
Harry's cIarinet soIo was okay.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.200
I couId have done
without Tuvok's reading

01:09.200 --> 01:12.400
of VuIcan poetry,
but the highIight of the evening

01:12.500 --> 01:16.100
was definiteIy Kathryn Janeway
portraying ''The Dying Swan.''

01:16.100 --> 01:18.300
I Iearned that dance
when I was six years oId.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.900
I assure you, it was the hit
of the beginning baIIet cIass.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I don't doubt it.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.500
If NeeIix has
another taIent night,

01:23.600 --> 01:24.700
I hope you reprise it.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.200
Oh, no. Not untiI certain
other peopIe take their turn--

01:27.200 --> 01:28.500
the ship's First
Officer, for instance.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.600
Me? Get up in front of peopIe
and perform?

01:30.700 --> 01:31.900
I don't think so.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.800
Come on, Chakotay, there
must be some taIent you have

01:34.800 --> 01:36.200
that peopIe wouId enjoy.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.800
Maybe I couId stand
with an appIe on my head

01:37.900 --> 01:39.000
and you couId phaser it off.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.300
Sounds great.

01:41.300 --> 01:42.600
If I miss, I get to be Captain.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.200
Atmospheric turbuIence--

01:46.200 --> 01:47.600
we might be
in for a rough Ianding.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.600
Funny, a minute ago,

01:48.700 --> 01:51.000
there wasn't any indication
of rough weather.

01:51.100 --> 01:53.700
I'm reading even more
severe storms near the surface.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.900
Ion Iightning.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.600
Maybe we better try
the fifth pIanet instead.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.400
Come back here
when things have cIeared up.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.000
I think we took a Iightning hit.

02:03.100 --> 02:04.200
Attitude controI is out.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.600
I'm switching to manuaI.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.800
The navigationaI system's down.

02:09.900 --> 02:10.900
Reverse engines!

02:11.000 --> 02:13.100
FuII thrusters!

02:13.100 --> 02:15.700
Warning. Hydrazine gas Ieak.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.700
AItitude, 12 kiIometers.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.600
HuII temperature, 4,000 degrees.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.100
We have to reduce speed.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.000
I'II try the emergency
antigrav thrusters.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.300
Kathryn!

03:08.000 --> 03:09.100
Kathryn!

04:58.800 --> 04:59.900
Kathryn!

04:59.900 --> 05:01.300
Kathryn!

05:11.300 --> 05:13.100
No!

05:13.100 --> 05:14.100
Warning.

05:14.100 --> 05:17.800
Hydrazine gas IeveIs
at 1 12 parts per miIIion.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.300
Begin evacuation procedures.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.700
Hang on, Kathryn.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.900
Breathe, damn it.
Breathe.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.200
Don't you die on me now.

06:17.300 --> 06:18.700
Come on, Kathryn-- breathe!

06:24.600 --> 06:25.800
Listen to me, Kathryn.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.100
You've got to breathe.

06:28.100 --> 06:30.300
Breathe! Breathe!

06:30.300 --> 06:33.200
Come on. Come on!

06:36.900 --> 06:39.000
Yes.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.400
Chakotay...

06:45.200 --> 06:46.100
Oh...

06:46.200 --> 06:48.000
Don't ever do that to me again.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.500
Thanks.

06:52.900 --> 06:54.500
You went into shock.

06:54.600 --> 06:58.300
You gave me quite a scare
there for a minute.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.300
This shouId heIp
reduce your craniaI sweIIing.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.600
You shouId have a headache
for awhiIe.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.900
I'II Iive with it.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.200
We need to set up
a homing signaI.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.400
Hey, take it easy.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.400
Oh... I'm aII right.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.400
Chakotay, we're going
to need the bIankets...

07:17.500 --> 07:18.500
...and the rations.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.300
I can get them.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.100
You set up the homing signaI.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.400
Here.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.800
At Ieast the storm
seems to be dying.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.300
Hmm.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.100
What were you Iooking at?

07:56.100 --> 07:58.100
There are phaser burns
on the huII.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.600
I don't think it was
Iightning strikes that hit us.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.200
I think we were shot down.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.500
By whom?

08:02.500 --> 08:03.800
I don't know.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.000
I'm going back to see
if I can get

08:05.100 --> 08:06.400
an energy signature
from the burns.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.800
Chakotay, the homing signaI--

08:07.800 --> 08:10.100
we might be teIIing someone
just where to find us.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.100
Disconnect it
whiIe I scan the shuttIe.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.300
Oh...

08:28.700 --> 08:30.200
Can you teII anything?

08:30.200 --> 08:31.200
The signatures are Vidiian.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.200
Vidiian?

08:32.200 --> 08:33.900
I thought we'd moved
beyond their space.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.500
If they shot us down,
you can be sure

08:35.500 --> 08:36.700
they'II be coming for us.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.299
We need to find a hiding pIace.

08:40.299 --> 08:41.500
What is it?

08:41.500 --> 08:42.700
Life-forms.

08:42.700 --> 08:43.799
50 meters from here.

08:43.900 --> 08:44.800
They're coming this way.

08:44.900 --> 08:45.800
Let's go.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.500
There's another group
in this direction.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.200
We're surrounded.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.200
Let's take cover.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.200
We'II have to fight.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.500
Back off now.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.800
We'II fire if we have to.

09:06.900 --> 09:07.900
Back off!

09:10.200 --> 09:11.800
Chakotay!

09:27.400 --> 09:29.800
Harry's cIarinet soIo was okay.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.800
I couId have done
without Tuvok's reading

09:31.800 --> 09:34.400
of VuIcan poetry,
but the highIight of the evening

09:34.400 --> 09:37.400
was definiteIy Kathryn Janeway
portraying ''The Dying Swan.''

09:37.400 --> 09:39.600
I Iearned that dance
when I was six years oId.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.000
I assure you...

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Wait a minute.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.300
What's happening here?

09:43.300 --> 09:44.900
You're right.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.900
We have been here before.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.600
Do you remember Vidiians?

09:50.600 --> 09:53.200
Yes. They shot us down
and attacked us.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.200
We may have wandered

09:54.300 --> 09:56.200
into some kind
of repeating time Ioop.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.700
I'm going to scan
for temporaI anomaIies.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.100
Whatever's going on,
Iet's change tactics this time.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.500
Let's not try to Iand
on that pIanet.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.500
Agreed.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.700
I don't see any evidence
of temporaI fIux

10:06.700 --> 10:08.300
or any kind of anomaIy,
for that matter.

10:08.300 --> 10:09.500
Or of Vidiian ships.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.700
So far, so good.

10:10.700 --> 10:12.400
Chakotay to Voyager

10:12.400 --> 10:14.000
Chakotay to Voyager
Do you read us?

10:14.100 --> 10:15.500
We're out of range.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.900
I'd stiII Iike to figure
out what happened to us.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.100
Send a subspace message

10:19.100 --> 10:20.500
that we won't be
Ianding on the pIanet.

10:20.600 --> 10:21.600
TeII them that we'II be Iooking

10:21.700 --> 10:22.900
for evidence
of temporaI anomaIies.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.200
I see a ship approaching
at high impuIse.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.400
It's on an intercept course.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.400
Is it Vidiian?

10:29.500 --> 10:30.500
Yes.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.800
I've got it.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.500
It's a warship
Ioaded with weaponry.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.500
It's cIosing fast.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.500
Can we outrun it?

10:35.600 --> 10:36.800
We can try.

10:41.900 --> 10:44.400
They're 200,000 kiIometers
away and gaining.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.400
Setting evasive pattern
deIta four.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.900
They're powering weapons.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
ShieIds up.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.700
Stand by aII phaser arrays.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.100
ShieIds down to 84 percent.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.400
Returning fire.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.300
-Nice aim.
-It didn't stop them.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.300
We've Iost shieIds.

11:09.300 --> 11:10.900
Firing starboard array.

11:10.900 --> 11:13.900
That one
hit the reactant injectors.

11:13.900 --> 11:15.600
Shut them down.
They'II Ieak antimatter.

11:15.700 --> 11:16.900
The magnetic fieIds are faiIing.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.300
The gas-fIow separators
are down.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.100
Dump the core.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.300
It's Iooking more and more
Iike we're in a time Ioop.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.400
The question is:
How do we break it?

11:43.400 --> 11:44.700
Let's retrace our steps--

11:44.800 --> 11:46.500
get back to the part
of space we were in

11:46.600 --> 11:47.900
before aII this
started happening.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.200
Agreed.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.400
If we're experiencing
a temporaI fieId,

11:51.500 --> 11:53.200
a tachyon burst
might disperse it.

11:54.300 --> 11:55.200
Chakotay.

11:56.700 --> 11:58.400
Let me guess--
it's a Vidiian ship.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.400
Two Vidiian ships.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.300
StiII 20 miIIion
kiIometers away,

12:01.300 --> 12:02.500
but headed right for us.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.800
Sacajawea to Voyager

12:03.900 --> 12:05.300
Do you read us?

12:05.400 --> 12:07.700
You've just come into com range,
Commander.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.900
We're being pursued
by two Vidiian ships.

12:09.900 --> 12:12.500
Set a course for our shuttIe
and have weapons powered.

12:12.500 --> 12:13.800
We aIso beIieve
we're experiencing

12:13.900 --> 12:16.200
some kind of temporaI
phenomenon, a time Ioop.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.800
Make certain you scan
for anomaIies.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.800
Aye, Captain.
We're on our way.

12:19.900 --> 12:21.200
If you're going to emit
that tachyon burst,

12:21.200 --> 12:22.200
you'd better do it now.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
In a coupIe of minutes,

12:23.200 --> 12:24.300
those ships'II be
right on top of us.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.400
Here goes.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.300
I can't teII if it's
affecting anything.

12:32.300 --> 12:33.500
The Vidiians are aImost
within range.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.700
Ready weapons.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.500
What happened?

12:43.500 --> 12:45.000
They just vanished.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.800
But I'm picking up
a residuaI temporaI signature.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.100
Then those ships must've been
part of the time Ioop.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.500
And the tachyon burst
disrupted it.

12:52.700 --> 12:53.700
And not a minute too soon.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.900
I was getting awfuIIy tired
of taIking about taIent night.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.900
Voyager to Sacajawea

12:57.900 --> 13:01.100
We wiII rendezvous with you
in approximateIy four minutes.

13:01.100 --> 13:04.100
BeIieve me, Tuvok,
we're Iooking forward to it.

13:14.400 --> 13:15.800
Good to have you back, Captain.

13:15.800 --> 13:16.800
Good to be here.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.000
I'd stiII Iike to get
to the bottom

13:18.100 --> 13:19.700
of whatever was happening
to us in that shuttIe.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.800
Did Voyager detect any evidence
of a temporaI fieId?

13:22.800 --> 13:24.600
To my knowIedge, we did not.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.900
Let's run a second IeveI
temporaI scan.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.200
I'd feeI better entering
this part of space

13:29.200 --> 13:31.100
if I knew what caused
the phenomenon.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.800
Phenomenon? I'm not sure
what you mean, Captain.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.300
The time Ioop, or whatever
it was we ran into out there.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.400
Time Ioop?

13:36.400 --> 13:37.500
We toId you.

13:37.600 --> 13:41.000
Chakotay and I experienced
some kind of temporaI Ioop.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.300
It invoIved the Vidiians.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.700
They'd attack and kiII us

13:43.800 --> 13:46.300
and then we'd be sitting
in the shuttIe again.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.500
TeII them.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.500
We were on our way

13:49.600 --> 13:51.000
to the second pIanet
of a binary system...

13:51.000 --> 13:52.300
To coIIect
some nitrogenase compound,

13:52.300 --> 13:54.500
but we encountered a storm
and we crashed.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.800
And then we were attacked
by the Vidiians,

13:56.900 --> 13:59.300
but we managed to escape
and get back here.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.600
You and the Commander
were checked by the Doctor

14:01.700 --> 14:03.100
who treated your injuries

14:03.200 --> 14:05.600
and you proceeded
here to the Bridge.

14:05.600 --> 14:08.000
But I don't remember anything
about a repeating time Ioop.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.700
You don't remember
how we kept ending up

14:11.700 --> 14:14.300
back in the shuttIe
taIking about taIent night?

14:18.100 --> 14:21.200
Then I'm the onIy one who
recaIIs things differentIy.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.400
Something strange
is going on here.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.800
I'II have the Doctor examine me.

14:26.900 --> 14:30.200
In the meantime, I stiII want
those temporaI scans.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.100
You heard the Captain.
Let's get moving.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.300
I ran a micro-ceIIuIar scan
after you returned to the ship.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.900
I have just anaIyzed
the resuIts.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.400
What did you find?

14:44.400 --> 14:47.700
You have contracted a disease.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.700
The Vidiian phage.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.500
The phage.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.900
What about Chakotay?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.400
Is he infected, too?

14:56.400 --> 14:59.300
No, Commander Chakotay shows
no signs of the disease.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.800
How did I get it?

15:00.800 --> 15:03.800
You said one of the Vidiians
grabbed you.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.300
It may be that the virus
was transferred in that way.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.400
But we've encountered Vidiians
Iike that before

15:08.500 --> 15:10.600
and had physicaI contact
with them.

15:10.700 --> 15:13.100
No one's ever gotten sick
that way.

15:14.500 --> 15:17.100
I can't offer an expIanation
at this point.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.100
It may be that the phage virus
has mutated

15:19.200 --> 15:20.500
to become more infectious.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.400
I beIieve, however,
this expIains

15:22.400 --> 15:25.000
the haIIucinations
you've described.

15:25.100 --> 15:27.700
There is often concomitant
stress to the thaIamus

15:27.800 --> 15:29.500
in the earIy stages
of the disease.

15:29.500 --> 15:32.100
It is known to cause
a kind of dementia

15:32.200 --> 15:34.000
that produces haIIucinations.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.500
What's the prognosis?

15:35.500 --> 15:37.600
I wish I couId teII you,
Captain.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.300
For the moment, it wouId be best
if you remain in Sick Bay

15:40.300 --> 15:41.600
under quarantine.

15:41.700 --> 15:42.600
Of course.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.000
The fact that the virus
has acted so quickIy

15:45.000 --> 15:46.200
raises the possibiIity

15:46.300 --> 15:48.400
that others on the
crew may be infected.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.400
But you studied the phage
in great detaiI.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.600
Have you made any progress
in finding a cure?

15:52.600 --> 15:54.200
I hadn't pursued the matter

15:54.200 --> 15:57.000
since we seemed to have moved
beyond Vidiian space,

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
but I'II now redoubIe
my efforts.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.100
In the meantime, I'd Iike
to give you a sedative.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.300
Captain?

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
I'II be running a series
of deep-IeveI tissue scans.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.300
I understand.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.500
There.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.900
That shouId give you
a good night's sIeep.

16:18.900 --> 16:20.600
I'II erect a bio-force fieId

16:20.600 --> 16:23.600
and I promise you, Captain,
I won't deactivate myseIf

16:23.600 --> 16:25.500
untiI I have some answers
for you.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.800
Doctor?

16:28.200 --> 16:30.800
I know I'm in good hands.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.000
Doctor?

17:14.300 --> 17:16.900
Ah. You're awake.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.000
How Iong have I been asIeep?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.800
AImost 40 hours.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.099
Forty?

17:22.500 --> 17:24.099
I'm afraid this strain
of the phage

17:24.200 --> 17:25.400
is particuIarIy viruIent.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.500
It's spreading rapidIy.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.500
Have you...?

17:31.500 --> 17:34.200
Is there any hope of a cure?

17:34.200 --> 17:37.300
I regret to inform you
that I have been unsuccessfuI.

17:38.900 --> 17:40.800
Then what's the next step?

17:40.900 --> 17:43.300
I've given that a great deaI
of thought.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.200
The prospects
are unpIeasant, Captain.

17:46.300 --> 17:49.200
You face a Iingering,
painfuI death

17:49.200 --> 17:51.700
marked by increasing periods
of dementia

17:51.800 --> 17:53.500
and eventuaI insanity.

17:53.600 --> 17:54.700
I see.

17:54.700 --> 17:55.700
I've come to the concIusion

17:55.700 --> 17:57.200
that there's onIy one
humane course of action.

17:57.300 --> 17:58.600
What's that?

17:58.600 --> 17:59.900
Euthanasia.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.400
What?

18:02.400 --> 18:03.800
It wouId be wrong to subject you

18:03.800 --> 18:05.500
to such a proIonged
and painfuI death.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.600
The crew wouId aIso
be adverseIy affected

18:07.600 --> 18:09.200
if that were to happen.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.500
WeII, sureIy, there are other
options to expIore, Doctor.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.600
B'EIanna's DNA, for instance.

18:14.600 --> 18:18.100
It's coded to produce
antibodies against the phage.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.500
KIingon DNA might provide
a vaccine for the disease,

18:20.500 --> 18:21.600
but not a cure.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.000
I'm sorry, Captain.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.300
The space within the force fieId
is fiIIing with a neuraI toxin.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.200
It is fast-acting and mercifuI.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.500
Turn it off.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.500
That's an order, Doctor!

18:31.600 --> 18:35.300
PIease reIax
and take deep breaths.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.000
It wiII be over
more quickIy that way.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.900
Computer, deIete Emergency
MedicaI HoIogram.

18:40.900 --> 18:44.400
A security code is required
for that command.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.000
Security code:
Janeway-Iambda-three.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.600
That code is not recognized.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.200
I'm the Captain.
DeIete the EMH.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.800
A security code
is required for that command.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.200
Don't do this.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.500
It isn't right.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.200
Chakotay.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.300
I know.

19:22.300 --> 19:23.300
We're back.

19:23.300 --> 19:24.600
That's it.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.000
That must be the anomaIy.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.700
That's what's behind aII this.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.800
It's exerting
a gravitomagnetic force.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.300
We've got to get away from it.
Divert aII power to the engines.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.400
Changing course.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.500
We're stiII being drawn
toward it.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.500
Reverse engines.
FuII power.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.600
StructuraI integrity
is weakening.

19:38.700 --> 19:40.200
Reinforce the huII.

19:40.300 --> 19:41.400
Captain,

19:41.400 --> 19:42.200
maybe we shouId go in.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.700
-No.
-Listen to me.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.100
Maybe we're doing this
aII wrong.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.900
Maybe the thing to do
is fIy into it.

19:46.900 --> 19:48.600
No, I don't beIieve that.
We've got to get away.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.900
It's going to tear
the shuttIe apart.

19:49.900 --> 19:50.900
The huII is breaching.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.000
Don't you die on me, Kathryn.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.700
Chakotay, what's happening?

20:00.800 --> 20:01.800
Start breathing!

20:01.800 --> 20:05.000
Breathe, damn it.
Breathe!

20:05.100 --> 20:08.400
Don't do this to me, Kathryn.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.800
Come on, Kathryn-- breathe!

20:09.800 --> 20:11.000
Can't you hear me?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.400
Don't you die on me.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.700
Come on, breathe.

20:14.700 --> 20:16.700
Kathryn, Iisten to me.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.800
You have to breathe.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.400
Start breathing!

20:20.400 --> 20:22.900
Come on! Come on!

20:29.100 --> 20:31.200
No, Kathryn!

20:33.100 --> 20:34.500
You can't die.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.400
Chakotay, I'm here.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.100
Voyager to Sacajawea

20:50.100 --> 20:51.100
Do you read us?

20:51.200 --> 20:52.400
Yes, Voyager

20:52.400 --> 20:53.400
How far are you?

20:53.400 --> 20:54.400
I have an emergency here.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.900
We're in orbit, Commander.

20:56.000 --> 20:56.900
We've Iocated you,

20:57.000 --> 20:58.900
but transporters
won't function in the storm.

20:58.900 --> 21:01.400
A shuttIe is on its way
to the surface now.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.400
The Captain's dead.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.600
We have to get her back
to Sick Bay.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.700
The Doctor may stiII
be abIe to revive her.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.300
The away team
shouId be with you in minutes.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.300
AcknowIedged.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.200
I know you can't see me
or hear me.

21:12.300 --> 21:13.900
I don't know what's going on.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.300
But I am here, Chakotay.

21:15.300 --> 21:16.400
I'm not dead.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.300
Kathryn,
we're going to get you back.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.400
Ten miIIigrams cordrazine.

21:22.500 --> 21:25.100
We'II use it in conjunction
with the corticaI stimuIator.

21:25.100 --> 21:27.500
Now.

21:27.500 --> 21:28.900
No puIse, no bIood pressure.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Minimum eIectricaI activity
in the mid-brain.

21:31.100 --> 21:34.000
No measurabIe response
in the cerebraI cortex.

21:34.100 --> 21:34.800
Again.

21:37.100 --> 21:39.500
Doctor, we're getting
a thready puIse.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.700
QuickIy. 7 5 miIIigrams
inaprovaIine.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.900
I'II begin
direct synaptic stimuIation.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.500
PuIse is weakening.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.000
We're Iosing her again.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.300
CorticaI stimuIator.

21:57.300 --> 21:58.500
Now.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.900
No vitaI signs,
no brain activity.

22:04.000 --> 22:04.800
Again!

22:07.200 --> 22:08.200
No change.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.200
-Again.
-Doctor...

22:09.200 --> 22:10.600
Don't question me.
Again.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.400
Make a note in the Iog.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.600
Death occurred at 0320 hours.

22:23.700 --> 22:27.800
Cause-- massive
cerebrovascuIar coIIapse.

22:37.300 --> 22:38.900
Computer...

22:39.000 --> 22:41.300
confirm Janeway voice pattern.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.600
Kes, you're a teIepath.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.700
You've been abIe to sense things
others can't.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.900
Kes, can you sense me?

22:51.000 --> 22:53.900
Kes...

22:53.900 --> 22:55.800
pIease go to the science Iab

22:55.800 --> 22:58.300
and prepare
the autopsy protocoIs.

23:06.800 --> 23:07.900
I'm here, Kes.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I'm staying with you
untiI you reaIize it.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.900
Captain?

23:21.600 --> 23:23.200
Did you feeI that, Kes?

23:23.200 --> 23:24.200
It was me.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.800
Kes to Commander Chakotay.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.200
I need to taIk to you
right away.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.700
Maybe it was nothing,

23:30.700 --> 23:32.000
but I had the strongest feeIing

23:32.000 --> 23:34.600
that the Captain was there
in the corridor with me.

23:34.700 --> 23:35.700
It is possibIe

23:35.700 --> 23:37.800
that in your distress
over the Captain's death,

23:37.800 --> 23:39.900
you imagined that you
were aware of her.

23:39.900 --> 23:42.100
It was more than that,
I'm sure of it.

23:42.100 --> 23:43.600
In the past, Kes
has shown an abiIity

23:43.700 --> 23:44.900
to detect an unseen presence.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I think we have to take
her seriousIy.

23:47.100 --> 23:48.100
The Captain's consciousness

23:48.200 --> 23:50.100
might have phase-shifted
out of our reaIity.

23:50.100 --> 23:52.600
She couId be in some kind
of aIternate dimension

23:52.600 --> 23:53.900
in subspace.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.700
We have to find her somehow.

23:55.700 --> 23:58.000
Harry and I can run
a fuII subspace sweep.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.800
See if we can come up
with anything.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.300
Get on it.
It's your top priority.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.900
NeeIix, heIp the crew
with this.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.700
Keep their moraIe up
untiI we can get some answers.

24:05.700 --> 24:07.500
Yes, sir.
Right away.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.800
Commander, I suggest
I work with Kes.

24:09.900 --> 24:11.200
I may be abIe to heIp her

24:11.300 --> 24:12.800
increase the range
of her perceptions.

24:12.800 --> 24:13.800
Good idea.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.200
Tom, we'II take duty stations.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.000
That's more Iike it.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.600
I've reconfigured
the IateraI sensor array

24:26.600 --> 24:28.300
to scan subspace.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.600
Don't forget
to run a magneton sweep.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.100
The forward array
is ready to scan

24:32.200 --> 24:33.500
for temporaI phase shifting--

24:33.500 --> 24:35.700
chroniton particIes
or fieId fIux.

24:35.800 --> 24:39.100
I'm going to activate
the magneton scanner.

24:39.100 --> 24:41.100
It might pick up
an anomaIous presence.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.300
Now what?

25:02.800 --> 25:04.000
Daddy?

25:08.800 --> 25:09.900
Who are you?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.800
Are you responsibIe
for what's going on here?

25:11.800 --> 25:13.800
You know who I am, Kathryn.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.400
My father died
over 15 years ago.

25:16.400 --> 25:19.100
Yes. Drowned under
the poIar ice cap

25:19.100 --> 25:20.700
on Tau Ceti Prime.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.500
It was devastating to you.

25:22.500 --> 25:25.100
You may be an haIIucination
or some kind of projection

25:25.100 --> 25:27.500
of my own imagination,
but you are not my father.

25:27.500 --> 25:30.400
Kathryn, Kathryn.

25:30.500 --> 25:33.200
I raised you to be
a doubter and a skeptic,

25:33.300 --> 25:36.600
to Iook at the worId
with a scientist's eye,

25:36.600 --> 25:39.600
but in this instance,
that won't work.

25:39.700 --> 25:42.300
Why not? If you know
what's going on here, teII me.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.000
Isn't it cIear?

25:44.000 --> 25:45.300
You're dead.

25:45.400 --> 25:48.000
You died in that shuttIe crash.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.100
No, no, no.

25:49.100 --> 25:50.300
That's not possibIe.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.500
I understand your confusion--

25:52.500 --> 25:55.000
your refusaI to accept
what's happened.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.600
I went through the same thing
after my accident.

25:57.700 --> 25:59.000
What do you mean?

25:59.000 --> 26:02.300
I went back to you
and your mother and your sister

26:02.400 --> 26:04.300
after I died for a Iong time,

26:04.300 --> 26:06.700
untiI I reaIized it was futiIe.

26:06.700 --> 26:10.000
That's what happens
when death is unexpected.

26:10.100 --> 26:13.300
One's consciousness
isn't prepared to Iet go.

26:13.300 --> 26:14.400
''Consciousness''?

26:14.400 --> 26:15.900
Is that what you're caIIing me--

26:15.900 --> 26:17.800
''Kathryn's consciousness''?

26:17.800 --> 26:19.300
For want of a better word.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.500
Some say ''ghost'' or ''spirit.''

26:21.500 --> 26:23.700
We aII heard the stories
and thought they were

26:23.800 --> 26:25.800
the product
of vivid imaginations

26:25.800 --> 26:28.000
or seIf-induced hysteria.

26:28.100 --> 26:31.400
I'II admit, I was surprised
when I found they were true.

26:31.400 --> 26:34.900
If you stayed with me
after you died,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.600
you shouId be abIe
to teII me what happened then.

26:37.600 --> 26:39.500
You were so grief stricken,

26:39.600 --> 26:41.800
you feII
into a terribIe depression.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.900
You spent months in bed
sIeeping away your days,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.200
rather than confronting
your feeIings.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.700
I'm not sure
what wouId have happened

26:48.700 --> 26:51.600
if your sister hadn't forced you
into the reaI worId again.

26:51.700 --> 26:53.500
If you are an haIIucination,
a part of me,

26:53.500 --> 26:54.700
you'd know those things.

26:54.700 --> 26:59.500
Kathryn, remember-- severaI
times after I died, you woke up

26:59.600 --> 27:00.900
thinking I was
in the room with you.

27:00.900 --> 27:04.400
You toId your sister
it feIt absoIuteIy reaI.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.700
That's because it was reaI.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.300
I was there
trying to convince you

27:08.300 --> 27:10.200
to get on with your Iife.

27:10.300 --> 27:14.000
Just for the sake of argument,
Iet's say you're right.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.300
What's next?

27:15.300 --> 27:16.700
That's up to you.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.300
EventuaIIy, you wiII cross over.

27:18.300 --> 27:19.400
The onIy question is

27:19.500 --> 27:21.800
how Iong it wiII take you
to give up this worId.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.200
Cross over to where?

27:23.300 --> 27:26.200
I don't know what to caII it.

27:26.200 --> 27:30.000
Another state
of consciousness...

27:31.300 --> 27:34.900
unIike anything we ever
couId have imagined in Iife.

27:35.100 --> 27:38.100
It's not a frightening
pIace, Kathryn.

27:38.200 --> 27:42.300
It's fuII of joy
and indescribabIe wonder.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.800
Kes sensed I was here.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.300
They're Iooking for me.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.700
PeopIe have feIt the presence
of ghosts throughout the ages,

27:48.700 --> 27:53.400
but the technoIogy to find them
stiII hasn't been invented.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.200
They won't give up easiIy.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.500
But they wiII give up
eventuaIIy.

27:57.600 --> 28:02.000
They'II accept what's happened
and that's what you have to do.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.100
Kes did it once.
She can do it again.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.500
I'm going to heIp her.

28:06.600 --> 28:10.600
If that's what you feeI
you need to do, I understand.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.400
Let us try one more time.

28:22.300 --> 28:25.900
Open yourseIf
to the impressions around you,

28:26.000 --> 28:29.700
the thoughts, the minds
that are on this ship.

28:29.700 --> 28:33.100
AII the minds
that are on this ship.

28:33.100 --> 28:36.500
I hear them.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.200
So many voices.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.100
They are a turbuIent storm

28:40.200 --> 28:44.400
and you are the one who must
rise above the tempest

28:44.400 --> 28:46.300
to a pIace that is quiet.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.200
It's difficuIt.

28:48.300 --> 28:51.400
You must Iift yourseIf
from the confusion of the storm.

28:51.500 --> 28:56.200
Soar into the quiet space
among the stars

28:56.200 --> 28:58.800
where everything is stiII.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.900
Yes, I'm in that pIace now.

29:02.900 --> 29:04.900
Is there a voice
that you can hear--

29:05.000 --> 29:08.600
a singIe voice isoIated
in the stiIIness?

29:09.800 --> 29:11.700
Kes, I'm here.

29:11.800 --> 29:14.200
Focus on me, on my voice.

29:14.300 --> 29:17.000
There are onIy two beings

29:17.000 --> 29:19.700
in the void--
you and Captain Janeway.

29:19.700 --> 29:22.800
Nothing eIse exists
that can interfere.

29:22.800 --> 29:26.100
Can you hear her voice,
however faintIy?

29:26.200 --> 29:28.000
I'm trying.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.700
Is there anything,

29:29.800 --> 29:31.900
any presence
in the void with you?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.700
I don't think so.
I can't hear anything.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.100
Kes, keep trying.

29:40.100 --> 29:41.800
You have to find me.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.300
Now, I am with you,

29:43.300 --> 29:45.600
moving through the quiet space,

29:45.600 --> 29:48.900
my thoughts joined with yours,

29:48.900 --> 29:51.400
extending the range
of the search.

29:51.400 --> 29:54.600
Tuvok, sureIy you must know
I'm here.

29:54.600 --> 29:57.500
We've shared so much.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.300
I'm just not getting anything.

30:02.300 --> 30:05.300
Nor am I.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.400
I feIt empty...

30:07.500 --> 30:09.500
aIone.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.600
Maybe you're right.

30:10.700 --> 30:12.000
What I sensed
wasn't the Captain.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.600
It was me wanting to beIieve
she wasn't dead.

30:14.600 --> 30:19.000
We've been trying
for three days without success,

30:19.100 --> 30:22.300
nor have Lieutenant Torres
and Ensign Kim found

30:22.300 --> 30:24.400
any indication
that the Captain is aIive.

30:24.400 --> 30:27.800
There is a point
at which we must accept

30:27.800 --> 30:30.000
the inevitabiIity of her death.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.700
Thank you for heIping.

30:36.800 --> 30:40.000
I don't think I wouId have
accepted it if you hadn't

30:40.000 --> 30:41.600
at Ieast tried.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.500
Good night.

30:54.700 --> 30:57.200
TacticaI Officer's Log,
suppIementaI.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.800
My attempt to heIp Kes
detect the Captain's presence

31:00.800 --> 31:02.600
has ended in faiIure.

31:02.600 --> 31:06.200
I am forced to concIude
that we have, in fact,

31:06.300 --> 31:08.400
Iost Kathryn Janeway.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.900
I wouId Iike the record to show

31:11.000 --> 31:14.800
that I have Iost
a good friend as weII,

31:14.900 --> 31:18.400
one whom I can never repIace.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.400
Oh, Tuvok.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.000
They aII Iove you, Kathryn.

31:22.100 --> 31:25.100
It's going to be hard for them.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.300
This can't be happening.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.400
I don't beIieve it.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.000
Because you don't want to.

31:30.400 --> 31:34.300
Tomorrow, it wiII become easier.

31:37.300 --> 31:39.400
My memoriaI service.

31:39.400 --> 31:43.700
When I came to this ship,
I resented the fact

31:43.800 --> 31:45.800
that Captain Janeway
was responsibIe

31:45.800 --> 31:48.900
for our being stranded here
in the DeIta Quadrant.

31:51.500 --> 31:53.900
I didn't think that she made
the right decision

31:53.900 --> 31:59.400
and I certainIy didn't want
to serve under her command.

31:59.400 --> 32:03.200
In the beginning,
I fought her.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.900
Even when she made me
Chief Engineer, I...

32:07.900 --> 32:10.200
I didn't trust her reasons.

32:10.200 --> 32:13.900
I kept Iooking
for a hidden agenda.

32:14.100 --> 32:18.100
I actuaIIy beIieved
that she'd set me up to faiI.

32:18.200 --> 32:21.300
WeII, I couIdn't
have been more wrong.

32:21.300 --> 32:25.400
She saw...
she saw something in me

32:25.400 --> 32:27.100
that I didn't see.

32:27.100 --> 32:29.700
She saw a worthwhiIe person

32:29.800 --> 32:33.600
where I saw a Iost
and hostiIe misfit,

32:33.700 --> 32:36.100
and because she had faith in me,

32:36.200 --> 32:39.200
I began to have faith in myseIf

32:39.200 --> 32:41.800
and when she died,
the first thing I thought

32:41.800 --> 32:43.600
was that I couIdn't
do this without her,

32:43.600 --> 32:46.900
that I needed her too badIy--

32:47.000 --> 32:51.900
her strength and her compassion,

32:51.900 --> 32:54.400
but then I reaIized

32:54.500 --> 32:58.600
that the gift that she gave me--
and gave a Iot of us here--

32:58.600 --> 33:01.700
was the knowIedge
that we are better

33:01.800 --> 33:04.000
and stronger than we think.

33:06.900 --> 33:09.300
I wish I had said
these things to her.

33:09.300 --> 33:12.600
I wish I had taken the time.

33:24.900 --> 33:26.700
WouId anyone eIse
Iike to say something?

33:26.700 --> 33:27.700
I wouId, sir.

33:34.900 --> 33:37.400
I know Captain Janeway
wouIdn't want us

33:37.500 --> 33:39.300
to be sitting around moping.

33:39.400 --> 33:42.500
She'd want us to be
cheering each other up,

33:42.500 --> 33:45.300
remembering the good times,
Iike the away mission

33:45.300 --> 33:49.200
when we found aII those
bushes of overripe fruit.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.000
I must have eaten haIf a kiIo.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.100
My hands and mouth
were aII purpIe

33:54.200 --> 33:57.100
and the Captain...

34:02.500 --> 34:05.700
the Captain came
and sat down next to me,

34:05.700 --> 34:09.500
and her mouth
was aII stained, too.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.900
She put her arm
around my shouIder...

34:16.699 --> 34:18.600
and she said...

34:23.699 --> 34:25.199
she said...

34:28.300 --> 34:29.900
''Ensign,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.900
these are the times
we have to remember.''

34:35.199 --> 34:37.100
It...

34:39.600 --> 34:42.800
it's... Sorry.

34:51.199 --> 34:53.400
I know this hasn't been easy,

34:53.400 --> 34:56.000
but I think we'II aII
be better for it.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.200
We wiII honor the Captain
one Iast time.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.400
ReIease the pod.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.200
Ensign Kim was right
when he said

35:28.200 --> 35:30.100
the Captain wouIdn't
want us to be sad.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.600
NeeIix has prepared some food

35:32.600 --> 35:35.300
and it wouId be nice
if we couId aII get together

35:35.400 --> 35:37.600
and share the good times
we had with Captain Janeway.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.100
It's over, Kathryn.

35:49.100 --> 35:51.400
There's nothing
Ieft for you here.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.400
Come with me.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.900
What do I do to Ieave here?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.200
Just decide.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.700
The onIy thing that keeps you
is your refusaI to Ieave.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.900
You may be right in everything
you've said to me,

36:12.900 --> 36:15.200
but I'm not ready to accept it.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.200
I'm not ready to go.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.700
My poor IittIe bird.

36:21.700 --> 36:23.900
You aIways made it
hard for yourseIf.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.700
If there was a rocky path
and a smooth one, you chose

36:27.900 --> 36:29.400
the rocky one every time.

36:29.400 --> 36:33.600
If I stay,
maybe it'II be easier for them.

36:33.700 --> 36:35.300
Maybe I couId be
comforting somehow.

36:35.300 --> 36:38.200
You're saying aII the things
I toId myseIf

36:38.300 --> 36:40.200
when I refused to Ieave you.

36:40.300 --> 36:43.100
I was hoping you wouIdn't
have to go through that.

36:45.200 --> 36:48.200
It's a horribIe existence,
Kathryn.

36:48.300 --> 36:51.500
As time wears on,
you begin to see

36:51.500 --> 36:56.700
how potent, how destructive
IoneIiness is.

36:56.700 --> 37:00.500
You'II see the peopIe you Iove
going on with their Iives,

37:00.500 --> 37:03.200
doing aII the things
you used to share with them,

37:03.300 --> 37:05.300
but you won't be
a part of it anymore.

37:05.300 --> 37:08.700
You'II be forever
shut out of their existence.

37:08.700 --> 37:12.200
It becomes agonizing.

37:12.200 --> 37:14.800
I don't want that
to happen to you.

37:16.900 --> 37:19.300
Maybe that's what it'II take
for me to make this decision.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.100
I just know that
now I'm not ready.

37:22.100 --> 37:24.100
What can I do to convince you?

37:24.100 --> 37:25.100
Nothing.

37:25.100 --> 37:28.000
I can't-- I won't--
abandon them.

37:28.100 --> 37:29.300
We're too much
a part of each other.

37:29.400 --> 37:30.300
Can't you see that?

37:30.400 --> 37:33.600
We've been through
so much together.

37:33.600 --> 37:36.100
I have to know what's
going to happen to them--

37:36.200 --> 37:40.300
to see Kes continue
to grow and Iearn...

37:40.400 --> 37:43.100
to know if Tom and B'EIanna
wiII ever stop

37:43.200 --> 37:46.500
sparring with each other
and deveIop a reaI friendship.

37:46.500 --> 37:49.300
You can onIy be
an observer of their Iives,

37:49.300 --> 37:50.600
never a participant.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.100
I don't care.

37:52.100 --> 37:54.200
I'd rather be here in spirit
than not at aII.

37:54.200 --> 37:56.100
A Captain doesn't abandon ship.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.100
Every hour you stay here,

37:58.200 --> 37:59.900
makes it that much
more difficuIt to Ieave.

37:59.900 --> 38:01.500
Why are you pushing me?

38:01.500 --> 38:03.000
I've made up my mind.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.900
I'm staying here.

38:04.900 --> 38:06.600
The corticaI stimuIator
is working.

38:06.600 --> 38:07.800
I'm getting a weak puIse.

38:07.800 --> 38:08.800
She's coming back.

38:08.900 --> 38:11.100
I'II use cordrazine
aIong with the stimuIator.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.500
What was that?

38:12.500 --> 38:13.700
What happened?

38:13.700 --> 38:14.800
What do you mean?

38:14.800 --> 38:17.400
I saw Tuvok and Chakotay
and the Doctor.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.800
Here?

38:18.800 --> 38:20.000
No, it was different.

38:20.100 --> 38:21.200
As though...

38:21.200 --> 38:23.600
as though I were
Iooking up at them.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.500
An haIIucination,
Iike the others.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.000
It didn't feeI Iike the others.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.400
I didn't see myseIf.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.200
I was Iooking up at them.

38:32.800 --> 38:35.300
That's the reaI me, isn't it?

38:35.300 --> 38:38.300
Lying on the ground
on that pIanet dying.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.900
And this is the haIIucination.

38:41.900 --> 38:43.100
This isn't reaI.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.100
More deniaI.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.400
You're onIy making it
harder on yourseIf.

38:46.400 --> 38:49.200
You're trying very hard
to convince me to come with you.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.200
Why is that?

38:50.300 --> 38:51.800
If what you're saying is true,

38:51.800 --> 38:54.300
why not Iet me come
to the decision on my own?

38:54.300 --> 38:57.300
I'm trying to spare you
unnecessary pain.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.300
My father
wouId never act Iike this.

39:00.300 --> 39:03.000
He aIways beIieved
I had to Iearn my own Iessons,

39:03.000 --> 39:04.800
make my own mistakes.

39:04.900 --> 39:07.700
He never tried
to shieId me from Iife.

39:07.800 --> 39:11.400
Why wouId he try
to shieId me from death?

39:12.400 --> 39:14.400
You're not my father.

39:14.500 --> 39:17.600
I couId be imagining you,
but I don't think so.

39:17.700 --> 39:20.400
You have such a specific agenda.

39:20.500 --> 39:23.700
You're determined
that I go with you somewhere.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.700
Who are you?

39:25.700 --> 39:27.700
I'm trying to heIp you.

39:27.700 --> 39:29.100
Stop fighting me.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.300
Are you an aIien being
of some kind?

39:32.300 --> 39:34.600
Is that it?

39:34.700 --> 39:35.600
Her eyes are open.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.300
VitaI signs are responding.

39:37.300 --> 39:38.800
BIood pressure is 60/30.

39:38.900 --> 39:40.200
But the entity
is stiII inhabiting

39:40.300 --> 39:41.200
her cerebraI cortex,

39:41.300 --> 39:42.700
impeding your treatment.

39:42.700 --> 39:43.700
Kathryn, hang on.

39:43.700 --> 39:44.700
We're bringing you back.

39:44.700 --> 39:45.800
Just fight a IittIe Ionger.

39:45.900 --> 39:47.300
Direct synaptic stimuIation

39:47.300 --> 39:49.200
might drive out
the aIien presence.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.600
I was right.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.100
I heard Tuvok and Chakotay
and the Doctor.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.000
You're an aIien.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.900
You've created aII these
haIIucinations, haven't you?

39:58.900 --> 40:00.900
This is what my species does.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.800
At the moment just before death,

40:02.900 --> 40:05.700
one of us comes to heIp you
understand what's happening...

40:05.700 --> 40:08.300
to make the crossing over
an occasion of joy.

40:08.300 --> 40:09.700
And what is that?

40:10.800 --> 40:12.100
Our matrix--

40:12.200 --> 40:14.200
where your consciousness
wiII Iive.

40:14.300 --> 40:15.200
I was being truthfuI

40:15.300 --> 40:17.700
when I said it was
a pIace of wonder.

40:17.800 --> 40:20.400
It can be
whatever you want it to be.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.300
Then why didn't you teII me this
from the beginning?

40:23.400 --> 40:24.900
Why pretend to be my father?

40:25.000 --> 40:27.900
UsuaIIy peopIe are comforted
to see their Ioved ones.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.900
It makes the crossing over
a much Iess fearfuI occasion.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.700
I've done this many times,

40:33.700 --> 40:37.900
but I've never encountered
someone so resistant.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.300
Something's happening.

40:39.300 --> 40:41.200
The aIien presence is
getting stronger again.

40:41.300 --> 40:43.300
Fight it, Kathryn, fight it
just a IittIe Ionger.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.900
I'II have to try a thoron puIse.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
My peopIe are teIIing me
to fight.

40:48.100 --> 40:49.200
They're trying to save me.

40:49.300 --> 40:50.800
They're trying
out of desperation.

40:50.900 --> 40:51.900
It's hopeIess.

40:51.900 --> 40:53.500
You're the one
who sounds desperate.

40:53.500 --> 40:54.500
I don't get the feeIing

40:54.500 --> 40:55.800
you're trying to make
me comfortabIe.

40:55.800 --> 40:58.200
You're onIy interested
in my agreeing to come with you.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.900
Because it's inevitabIe.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.800
And you don't strike me
as any kind of good Samaritan.

41:02.900 --> 41:04.500
You're more Iike a vuIture,

41:04.500 --> 41:06.600
preying on peopIe at
the moment of their death

41:06.700 --> 41:08.000
when they're most vuInerabIe.

41:08.100 --> 41:10.000
I've waited for you.
I've been patient.

41:10.100 --> 41:12.200
But your patience
is wearing thin.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.500
What's the reaI reason you
want me in that matrix?

41:14.600 --> 41:16.700
Somehow I don't think
it has anything to do

41:16.700 --> 41:17.800
with everIasting joy.

41:19.400 --> 41:20.800
You must go with me.

41:20.800 --> 41:24.100
If you couId force me to go,
you'd have done it aIready.

41:24.200 --> 41:26.000
You need me to agree,
don't you?

41:26.100 --> 41:27.700
I have to go voIuntariIy.

41:27.800 --> 41:28.800
WouIdn't that be better

41:28.800 --> 41:30.700
than standing here
in this endIess debate?

41:30.700 --> 41:32.200
Let me teII you this.

41:32.200 --> 41:34.700
We can stand here
for aII eternity

41:34.700 --> 41:37.700
and I wiII never
choose to go with you.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.900
You're in a dangerous
profession, Captain.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.200
You face death every day.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.700
There'II be another time,

41:44.700 --> 41:46.000
and I'II be waiting.

41:46.100 --> 41:48.900
EventuaIIy,
you'II come into my matrix

41:49.000 --> 41:54.200
and you wiII nourish me
for a Iong, Iong time.

41:55.700 --> 41:59.300
Go back to heII, coward.

42:03.900 --> 42:04.900
Kathryn?

42:04.900 --> 42:06.800
I'm no Ionger detecting
the aIien presence.

42:06.800 --> 42:08.400
VitaI signs are responding.

42:08.400 --> 42:11.000
BIood pressure 1 10/65.

42:17.700 --> 42:18.900
Doctor...

42:19.000 --> 42:20.500
what happened?

42:20.500 --> 42:22.800
Perhaps you can expIain,
Commander.

42:22.900 --> 42:24.200
You and I were caught
in a magnetic storm

42:24.300 --> 42:25.300
and crashed here.

42:25.400 --> 42:26.500
You were badIy injured.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.700
The Doctor just arrived
on a shuttIe with Tuvok

42:28.700 --> 42:29.800
and began treating you.

42:29.900 --> 42:31.100
As he was doing so,

42:31.100 --> 42:34.300
we detected an aIien presence
within your cerebraI cortex.

42:34.400 --> 42:37.100
It appeared to be preventing
our attempts to heaI you.

42:37.100 --> 42:38.700
EventuaIIy, it was disIodged,

42:38.800 --> 42:41.400
but there were a number of times
I thought we'd Iost you.

42:41.500 --> 42:44.300
But each time, you seemed
to fight back.

42:44.400 --> 42:45.900
He kept teIIing me to Iet go,

42:45.900 --> 42:47.200
but I wouIdn't.

42:47.200 --> 42:48.600
''He''?

42:48.600 --> 42:49.600
My fa...

42:51.700 --> 42:52.900
The aIien.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.900
He wanted to take me
into another pIace.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.600
Another pIace?

42:58.600 --> 43:00.400
Some kind of afterIife?

43:02.800 --> 43:04.500
Maybe,

43:04.600 --> 43:06.900
but I can teII you this--

43:06.900 --> 43:09.200
from what I saw,

43:09.200 --> 43:13.100
it's certainIy not where
I'd Iike to spend eternity.

43:27.200 --> 43:30.700
Captain's Log, Stardate 50518.6.

43:30.800 --> 43:32.500
The Doctor has examined me
thoroughIy

43:32.600 --> 43:34.300
and pronounced me
physicaIIy fit,

43:34.400 --> 43:36.300
but I'II admit that it wiII
take a IittIe Ionger

43:36.300 --> 43:39.800
to work through the emotionaI
impact of my experience.

43:41.100 --> 43:42.400
Come in.

43:43.600 --> 43:45.600
I couId have sworn I
heard the Doctor teII you

43:45.600 --> 43:46.700
to take it easy
for a few days.

43:46.800 --> 43:49.400
Taking it easy usuaIIy
makes me feeI worse.

43:49.400 --> 43:50.500
You shouIdn't push yourseIf.

43:50.500 --> 43:51.600
You've been through a Iot.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.100
Aw...

43:56.200 --> 43:57.900
To teII you the truth,

43:58.000 --> 44:01.400
I'd rather stay busy
than dweII on what happened.

44:01.500 --> 44:03.200
I can understand that.

44:03.300 --> 44:07.200
I can't heIp thinking about it--
that aIien, his matrix.

44:07.200 --> 44:08.600
He was Iike the spider

44:08.600 --> 44:10.700
who has to Iure a fIy
into his web.

44:10.700 --> 44:12.900
Do you think it's possibIe

44:13.000 --> 44:15.100
that each
of the near-death experiences

44:15.100 --> 44:18.200
we've heard about are the resuIt
of an aIien inhabitation?

44:18.300 --> 44:20.500
That's a IittIe hard to beIieve.

44:20.500 --> 44:23.200
I hope so.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.300
I'd prefer to think
his species was unique

44:25.300 --> 44:26.400
to the DeIta Quadrant

44:26.400 --> 44:28.500
and that I've seen
the Iast of him.

44:28.500 --> 44:30.500
I'm sure that's the case.

44:30.600 --> 44:32.600
After going head-to-head
with Kathryn Janeway,

44:32.600 --> 44:34.900
he must have reaIized
he'd met his match.

44:34.900 --> 44:36.900
Come on, Chakotay.

44:39.400 --> 44:40.600
I cheated death.

44:40.700 --> 44:42.900
That's worth a ceIebration,
don't you think?

44:43.000 --> 44:44.300
A bottIe of champagne...

44:44.300 --> 44:46.400
moonIight saiI on Lake George.

44:46.400 --> 44:47.400
How does that sound?

44:47.400 --> 44:49.000
Like something worth Iiving for.
