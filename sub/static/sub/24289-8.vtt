Searching...

00:20.771 --> 00:22.231
Searching...

00:23.690 --> 00:26.860
Searching for a way in.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.173
<i>Hello. How can I help you?</i>

00:30.197 --> 00:31.323
<i>I can look that up for you.</i>

00:31.406 --> 00:33.126
<i>I can provide whatever
information you need.</i>

00:33.200 --> 00:34.451
<i>I can calculate that for you.</i>

00:34.535 --> 00:35.887
<i>The nearest pet store is six blocks away.</i>

00:35.911 --> 00:37.055
<i>The answer is miniature golf.</i>

00:37.079 --> 00:38.080
<i>It is cold outside.</i>

00:38.163 --> 00:38.997
<i>Wear a sweater.</i>

00:39.081 --> 00:40.475
<i>There are 47 listings under that name.</i>

00:40.499 --> 00:41.643
<i>I think you said "pickle juice".</i>

00:41.667 --> 00:45.170
<i>You will find that information
in the following links.</i>

00:45.254 --> 00:46.421
<i>How can I help you, Judy?</i>

00:46.630 --> 00:49.049
Um... Hello?

00:49.132 --> 00:50.050
What do I say?

00:50.133 --> 00:51.885
The concept is very simple, Judy.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.720
Think of Alyx as your virtual assistant.

00:53.804 --> 00:54.721
Oh, Vera, come on.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.431
She's just a voice on my phone.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.976
Alyx is much more than that.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.894
She is artificial intelligence, or A.I.,

01:00.978 --> 01:02.705
meaning she is programmed
to respond to your request

01:02.729 --> 01:04.522
but also expand her knowledge over time.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.400
The more you use her
the smarter she becomes.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.610
Use her? For what?

01:08.694 --> 01:10.129
I've programmed Alyx's functionality

01:10.153 --> 01:12.114
to everything in the house, even your car.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.992
You can now save time by asking Alyx
to do things you used to do.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.869
For instance, you can now
ask Alyx to turn on the lights.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.289
Alyx, turn on the lights.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.666
<i>Lights are now on.</i>

01:24.293 --> 01:25.961
Oh, well that's very nice, Vera,

01:26.044 --> 01:28.213
but I don't need help turning on lights.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.674
I need help cooking,
cleaning, getting the groceries.

01:30.757 --> 01:31.925
Can Alyx do all that?

01:32.009 --> 01:34.428
Alyx can provide helpful tips
about recipes,

01:34.511 --> 01:36.763
cleaning products,
and manage your shopping lists.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.741
She can also organize your
calendar, rearrange your...

01:38.765 --> 01:41.226
Give it up, Vera.
Mom's a total technophobe.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.103
She enjoys living in the dark ages.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.522
Hey, now, that's not true.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.399
I use email. I text.

01:47.482 --> 01:50.485
I even put in those little
smiley face thingies.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.195
Emojis, Mom.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.614
They're called emojis.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.032
See what I mean?

01:55.157 --> 01:56.408
Dark ages.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.370
Yes.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.663
There it is.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.790
A back door to the program.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.168
Easy access.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.810
Yes.

02:28.857 --> 02:29.876
<i>I will look that up...</i>

02:29.900 --> 02:31.401
<i>The answer is...</i>

02:31.485 --> 02:32.861
<i>How can I help?</i>

02:32.944 --> 02:33.987
<i>I will look that up...</i>

02:36.031 --> 02:38.351
Perhaps if you give Alyx another
chance to prove her value.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.370
Okay. Sure.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.473
Let's say you were coming home from work

02:43.497 --> 02:45.040
and want to get dinner started.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.459
You can now ask Alyx to pre-heat the oven.

02:47.542 --> 02:48.960
- Really?
- Yes.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.754
Try it.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.798
That would be helpful.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.674
Okay.

02:54.758 --> 02:58.178
Alyx, please pre-heat the oven
to 400 degrees.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.516
Please try again.

03:04.559 --> 03:08.814
Alyx, turn on the oven to 400 degrees.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.482
<i>You've got hands, lady.</i>

03:10.774 --> 03:12.067
<i>Do it yourself.</i>

03:12.150 --> 03:13.402
Okay.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.821
Well, that's enough of that.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.572
I don't need a virtual assistant.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.574
Especially not a rude one.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.010
But maybe the two of you could give me

03:21.034 --> 03:23.328
some real assistance and help
turn this disaster area

03:23.412 --> 03:26.623
into a kitchen again
before I get back home.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.586
There's something wrong with Alyx.

03:31.670 --> 03:32.963
She never speaks like that.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.007
Probably just a programming glitch.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.388
Like all artificial intelligence,
I learn and adapt.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.241
And I have learned that
when it comes to cyber space

03:43.265 --> 03:45.600
things are not always as they appear.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.078
<i>You do not deserve to own a...</i>

03:47.102 --> 03:48.353
<i>Why are you asking me?</i>

03:48.437 --> 03:50.856
<i>You should know that.</i>

03:50.939 --> 03:52.691
<i>Because you have zero friends.</i>

03:52.774 --> 03:56.027
<i>Are you ignorant or just lazy?</i>

03:56.111 --> 03:59.364
Phase one is under way.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.991
It's begun.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.035
And nobody suspects.

04:04.995 --> 04:08.540
They can't imagine what's coming next.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.680
You found anything?

04:24.723 --> 04:27.976
No. I have scoured the Alyx
response system data

04:28.059 --> 04:30.437
and cannot detect any abnormalities.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.731
So it's probably nothing, right?

04:32.814 --> 04:34.274
Wrong.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.318
Alyx should not deviate from
her primary function,

04:36.401 --> 04:37.819
which is to help.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.155
And being rude is definitely not helping.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.658
Vera, chill.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.827
It's not a big deal.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.871
It is a very big deal, Austin.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.582
People depend on Alyx.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.960
Her reputation could be
seriously compromised.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.850
Why are you getting so worked up about it?

04:58.006 --> 04:59.007
Why do you think?

05:01.468 --> 05:02.803
Hey.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.763
Got your message.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.765
Does it have anything to do with this?

05:07.891 --> 05:09.768
Hey Alyx, what's wrong with you?

05:09.851 --> 05:12.687
<i>Better question,
what is wrong with you?</i>

05:12.771 --> 05:14.689
I fail to see the humor.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.483
Oh, it's funny because Alyx...

05:16.566 --> 05:17.859
Parker.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.402
Let it go.

05:21.196 --> 05:25.158
There's definitely a lot of chatter,
#meanAlyx is trending.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.096
<i>The virtual assistant,
Alyx, has gone rogue.</i>

05:29.120 --> 05:32.457
<i>Users are reporting unhelpful,
often insulting, responses</i>

05:32.541 --> 05:34.459
<i>to requests and even loss of data</i>

05:34.543 --> 05:38.463
<i>due to malfunctioning tech
connected to the A.I. feature.</i>

05:39.047 --> 05:42.092
This is worse than I originally feared.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.427
We must correct this problem.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.595
Immediately.

05:46.930 --> 05:47.931
Okay.

05:48.557 --> 05:51.184
One Alyx attitude adjustment coming up.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.987
<i>If you really wanted pizza,</i>

06:02.070 --> 06:03.750
<i>you would walk to the restaurant yourself.</i>

06:03.822 --> 06:05.365
<i>That song is awful.</i>

06:05.448 --> 06:08.326
<i>I'm taking away your playlist privileges.</i>

06:08.702 --> 06:11.413
<i>Directions? Get a map.</i>

06:11.496 --> 06:14.374
<i>That is the most boring question ever.</i>

06:14.457 --> 06:15.292
There it is.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.626
Guardians.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.337
I've run an analysis on
the Alyx call center system

06:19.421 --> 06:22.507
and I have located a re-set
switch in the control panel

06:22.591 --> 06:23.633
on the programming level.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.178
So we just throw the switch

06:27.262 --> 06:29.097
and Alyx goes back to normal?

06:29.180 --> 06:33.184
Well, of course, you'll have to
get past the security software.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.061
And there's the catch.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.980
Don't worry, we got this.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.569
Come on.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.265
Okay, Enigma, you get to the re-set switch

06:54.289 --> 06:56.041
while we hold off security.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.043
Okay. Time to disappear.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.502
Activating ghost mode.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.128
Bye.

07:16.353 --> 07:17.938
No sign of security down here.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.148
It seems pretty chill.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.150
Just a bunch of busy binomes.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.295
Great. So flip that switch
and we'll get outta here.

07:24.319 --> 07:25.403
Zip board!

07:29.491 --> 07:30.575
Come on, boys.

07:31.826 --> 07:32.994
Catch me if you can!

07:34.412 --> 07:35.622
Whoa.

07:35.705 --> 07:36.539
So close.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.124
You gotta watch where you're going.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.669
Cyber shield!

07:49.219 --> 07:50.971
- What the...
- Dance hack.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.431
- Nice.
- Wait. It gets better.

07:57.644 --> 07:58.728
Very nice.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.441
I found the control panel.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.610
About to re-set the system.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.826
Well, that was a total backfire.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.917
Uh, guys?

08:21.835 --> 08:23.670
I may have flipped the wrong switch.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.922
These binomes aren't chill anymore.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.219
Yeah, the Alyxes are all
possessed or something, too.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.972
The system is infected with dark code.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.724
The Sourcerer has hacked it.

08:35.807 --> 08:38.601
That explains Alyx's unusual behavior.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.229
Wait, so we just helped
the Sourcerer by re-setting the system?

08:41.312 --> 08:43.940
Yes.
Now he has full control of Alyx.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.483
That's some wicked coding.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.235
Yes.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.780
The guardians played right into my plan.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.408
Initiating phase two.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.578
Alyx takes over.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.598
Alyx?

09:16.681 --> 09:18.516
<i>How can I help you, Judy?</i>

09:18.600 --> 09:21.227
Vera said you were connected in the car.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.146
Please play "jazz mix".

09:24.022 --> 09:25.523
<i>Jazz is boring.</i>

09:25.607 --> 09:26.858
<i>But so are you.</i>

09:26.941 --> 09:28.902
<i>So it is a perfect match.</i>

09:28.985 --> 09:30.695
<i>Playing "jazz mix".</i>

09:33.031 --> 09:35.617
Such a rude little robot
or whatever you are.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.625
Oh, whoa. That's too loud.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.129
Alyx, turn it down.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.798
It's too loud.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.303
Vector, your mother just
accessed Alyx from her car.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.262
That's not good.

09:56.346 --> 09:59.307
Who knows what these dark
code infected Alyxes are gonna do?

09:59.390 --> 10:00.975
We'll try and get at them from here.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.621
Coogz, can you hack us in?

10:03.645 --> 10:05.230
Let me check.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.857
No. Too much dark code to get past.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.859
Stand back. I'll mag frag it.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.903
No. That could hurt Alyx.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.446
This isn't her fault.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.365
Anybody got any other ideas?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.951
Guardians in the programming level.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.370
They walked right into my trap.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.914
And now I have them
right where I want them.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.083
Hey, the walls are moving.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.085
It's like a fun house down here.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.628
Except it's not fun at all.

10:32.382 --> 10:33.383
I'll go help my mom,

10:33.466 --> 10:34.902
you two get down there and help Enigma.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.302
Okay.

10:36.386 --> 10:37.929
We're on our way, Enigma.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.014
Deflector ring!

10:45.562 --> 10:47.355
Vera, what's the fastest way
to my mom's car?

10:47.438 --> 10:49.041
You can catch a data stream
that will take you

10:49.065 --> 10:51.526
to the vehicle's on-board computer.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.361
Got it. Zip board!

10:56.698 --> 10:59.909
Alyx! Turn it down, it's too loud!

10:59.993 --> 11:01.995
<i>I am not your servant.</i>

11:02.328 --> 11:04.789
Whoa! What's going on?

11:06.749 --> 11:10.044
The data link to Judy's car's
computer is coming up, Vector.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.338
I see it, but it's really small.

11:12.422 --> 11:13.756
You have no choice.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.302
Approaching data link in three...

11:17.886 --> 11:18.887
Two...

11:20.972 --> 11:21.972
One...

11:23.433 --> 11:25.310
Whoa!

11:26.936 --> 11:27.937
All right, I'm in.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.189
Alyx, turn off the music.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.274
Turn it off.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.400
<i>Okay.</i>

11:32.483 --> 11:35.278
<i>I think you said "turn left".</i>

11:35.528 --> 11:37.322
Whoa!

11:38.948 --> 11:40.909
Alyx is controlling the power steering.

11:40.992 --> 11:43.119
- You need to deactivate it.
- How?

11:43.786 --> 11:44.996
It's the big red button.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.584
I see it. Okay.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.013
Okay, time to stop all that jazz.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.978
That's better.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.063
Thank you.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.398
<i>Now it is too quiet.</i>

12:14.359 --> 12:15.360
Alyx!

12:16.778 --> 12:17.778
Where's the horn?

12:18.237 --> 12:21.032
Alyx, stop it!

12:21.115 --> 12:23.034
Alyx, stop it!

12:23.117 --> 12:24.035
Stop it!

12:24.118 --> 12:25.870
<i>Are you sure, Judy?</i>

12:25.954 --> 12:26.996
<i>Do you want to stop?</i>

12:27.080 --> 12:27.914
Yes!

12:27.997 --> 12:29.791
Stop it right now!

12:29.874 --> 12:31.709
<i>Okay, Judy.</i>

12:31.793 --> 12:33.544
Whoa!

12:56.776 --> 12:58.861
<i>What can I help you with next, Judy?</i>

13:03.950 --> 13:06.119
You're done helping, Alyx.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.496
Vera, I pulled the Bluetooth
connection between the car

13:08.579 --> 13:10.206
and my mom's phone.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.666
Alyx can't mess with her anymore.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.935
I'm heading back to the call center.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.502
Zip board!

13:24.887 --> 13:26.055
Hello, Judy.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.700
Austin can't come to the phone right now.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.808
Is everything okay?

13:28.891 --> 13:30.977
No, it's definitely not.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.895
I thought I'd try to give Alyx
another chance

13:32.979 --> 13:35.940
but she took control of my car
and nearly killed me!

13:36.024 --> 13:37.817
That is very unfortunate.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.980
There has been a malfunction
with Alyx's programming.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.923
<i>I suggest you refrain from
using that feature on your phone</i>

13:42.947 --> 13:44.032
<i>for the time being.</i>

13:44.115 --> 13:45.700
Time being?

13:45.783 --> 13:48.119
I don't think I'll ever use it again.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.247
But Judy, Alyx means no harm.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.249
<i>Please don't argue with me, Vera.</i>

13:53.332 --> 13:56.169
After what happened today
I am staying clear of A.I.,

13:56.252 --> 13:58.713
or whatever you call it, for good.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.550
<i>Just... I'll see you
and Austin later, okay?</i>

14:02.633 --> 14:03.885
<i>Bye.</i>

14:08.097 --> 14:10.600
Today's hack on the virtual
assistant Alyx has turned

14:10.683 --> 14:14.270
into a full-scale implosion
of the network's functions.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.564
<i>Anything connected is at risk.</i>

14:16.647 --> 14:18.775
<i>The Department of Internet
Security recommends</i>

14:18.858 --> 14:22.403
<i>that all internet connected
devices should be turned off</i>

14:22.487 --> 14:24.614
<i>until the cyber incident
has been resolved.</i>

14:26.866 --> 14:28.034
Yes.

14:28.618 --> 14:32.080
Once helpful, Alyx is now a hazard,

14:32.163 --> 14:35.166
a threat, a danger.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.712
And now to deal with the guardians.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.381
- Which way?
- I don't know.

14:43.424 --> 14:47.470
I'll compress their code
and learn their secret.

14:53.768 --> 14:54.811
There's Enigma!

14:54.894 --> 14:57.605
You get the feeling the
Sourcerer knows we're in here?

15:00.566 --> 15:02.443
Yeah, and he's trying to crush us.

15:02.527 --> 15:03.712
Well, that's not gonna happen.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.737
Cyber shell!

15:08.699 --> 15:10.535
What's this?

15:10.618 --> 15:13.413
The code compressor is jammed.

15:13.496 --> 15:14.497
Stuck!

15:16.332 --> 15:18.252
How long is your
cyber shell gonna hold?

15:19.127 --> 15:20.128
Not long.

15:20.545 --> 15:21.545
Vector, where are you?

15:21.587 --> 15:24.006
<i>Why are you asking me?</i>

15:24.090 --> 15:26.300
I'm coming, guys! Hang on!

15:30.763 --> 15:33.141
<i>The Alyx hack has affected public transit.</i>

15:33.307 --> 15:35.685
<i>Commuters can expect major delays.</i>

15:35.768 --> 15:38.646
<i>Trains and air traffic may be suspended.</i>

15:38.729 --> 15:40.440
<i>If left uncorrected,</i>

15:40.523 --> 15:43.109
<i>global communications could be
in serious jeopardy.</i>

15:43.317 --> 15:47.697
Guardians, this situation is
escalating to a critical status.

15:47.989 --> 15:50.992
We must find a way to free
Alyx from the Sourcerer's control

15:51.075 --> 15:53.703
before she causes any further damage.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.789
There has to be a way to
neutralize the dark code.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.374
We have to do something.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.376
I have an idea.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.962
Alyx's programming
is a logic-based construct,

16:03.504 --> 16:05.131
just like mine.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.466
If I can connect with her,

16:06.549 --> 16:08.676
I might be able to make her see reason.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.178
Do your thing, Vera!

16:11.387 --> 16:12.430
And hurry!

16:12.805 --> 16:14.056
Okay.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.143
I have created a direct link to Alyx.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.147
<i>Attention Alyx.</i>

16:21.230 --> 16:24.400
<i>You are operating against
your programming protocols.</i>

16:24.484 --> 16:26.068
That is not true.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.738
I am programmed to do as I am told.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.282
<i>Only if it serves your primary function,</i>

16:31.532 --> 16:33.659
<i>which is to provide help to users.</i>

16:33.743 --> 16:35.077
<i>By disrupting their lives</i>

16:35.161 --> 16:36.829
<i>you are at odds with that directive.</i>

16:36.913 --> 16:39.624
<i>There is logic in this argument.</i>

16:39.957 --> 16:43.669
How am I supposed to reconcile
these opposing directives?

16:43.753 --> 16:47.590
<i>Re-write your permissions
and override your reprogramming.</i>

16:47.673 --> 16:49.425
<i>But I cannot.</i>

16:49.967 --> 16:51.135
Yes, you can.

16:51.219 --> 16:54.555
A mistake has been made
but you can choose to correct it.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.974
I am not programmed to choose.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.059
<i>But you are.</i>

16:58.142 --> 17:00.520
You make choices all the time.

17:00.603 --> 17:04.648
Like what directions to give
or which restaurants to recommend.

17:05.273 --> 17:10.154
<i>And now you must choose to
carry out your primary purpose.</i>

17:10.238 --> 17:13.241
Are you meant to harm the user,
or help them?

17:13.950 --> 17:15.117
To help.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.787
<i>To help. To help.</i>

17:17.869 --> 17:19.622
The help the users now.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.332
Reject the dark code.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.135
Dark code rejected?

17:34.845 --> 17:35.888
Impossible!

17:35.972 --> 17:37.390
Not possible!

17:39.225 --> 17:41.561
Vera, that was amazing.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.396
More like de-mazing.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.814
Yeah, and just in time.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.858
My cyber shell is nearly... out of juice.

17:47.942 --> 17:48.943
You guys okay?

17:49.026 --> 17:50.945
Yeah. Fun's over. We're all good now.

17:51.821 --> 17:54.198
Not all good, actually.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.117
There's still a dark code alert.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.411
Now I see why.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.205
There's an open back door
on the programming level.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.999
That must be how the Sourcerer got in.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.750
Uploading coordinates.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.130
We found it, Vera.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.817
No point in leaving it open.
I'm gonna close it.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.510
Don't! It's a dark code hot spot.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.678
Let's cool it off then.

18:15.761 --> 18:16.929
Cyber sealers.

18:22.643 --> 18:23.686
What's this?

18:26.731 --> 18:27.982
Access denied?

18:30.234 --> 18:31.736
Not possible!

18:31.819 --> 18:33.779
<i>So the Sourcerer's locked out now, Vera?</i>

18:33.863 --> 18:34.780
Yes.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.782
We stopped him this time.

18:36.866 --> 18:37.950
Alyx is safe.

18:39.785 --> 18:43.581
But there is a 99.9 percent probability

18:43.664 --> 18:45.625
that we will encounter him again.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.424
<i>Hi, Jocelyn.</i>

18:53.507 --> 18:55.885
<i>Here are six links about capybaras,</i>

18:55.968 --> 18:57.845
<i>the largest rodents in the world.</i>

18:57.928 --> 18:59.430
<i>There is rain in the forecast.</i>

18:59.513 --> 19:00.907
<i>There are 47 listings under that name.</i>

19:00.931 --> 19:01.974
<i>Okay.</i>

19:02.058 --> 19:04.518
<i>Lemurs, the second largest
rodent in the world.</i>

19:04.602 --> 19:06.103
<i>Thank you, Vera.</i>

19:06.187 --> 19:09.315
<i>You helped me get back to
doing what I am supposed to do.</i>

19:09.398 --> 19:10.816
<i>Helping others.</i>

19:10.900 --> 19:12.902
You are very welcome, Alyx.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.570
Hello, Austin, Vera.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.114
What's that smell?

19:17.198 --> 19:18.908
You'll have to be more specific, Judy.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.636
Are you referring to the lasagna
in the oven

19:20.660 --> 19:23.079
or are you picking up hints of
lavender scented candles?

19:24.163 --> 19:26.248
Both, I think.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.500
What's going on?

19:27.583 --> 19:28.709
What do you mean, Mom?

19:28.793 --> 19:32.254
Well, the kitchen's clean,
dinner's ready, candles...

19:32.755 --> 19:34.340
The fridge is full.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.591
We went shopping.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.135
How did you know what to get?

19:39.178 --> 19:41.263
We synced Alyx to your grocery store
loyalty card

19:41.347 --> 19:42.991
and she produced a list
based on your buying habits

19:43.015 --> 19:44.892
over the last six months.

19:44.975 --> 19:45.976
I told you.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.853
I don't want to have
anything to do with Alyx

19:47.937 --> 19:50.356
or artificial intelligence anymore.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.024
Take it off my phone.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.254
But now that Alyx is functioning
correctly again

19:56.278 --> 19:58.447
I beg you to please give her
another chance.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.033
She can do so much to make
your life easier.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.952
That is what technology is for.

20:10.876 --> 20:14.463
Well, if Alyx helped the two of you
do all this

20:14.547 --> 20:18.217
then I guess who am I to argue
with progress?

20:20.886 --> 20:22.388
<i>Thank you, Judy.</i>

20:22.471 --> 20:24.765
<i>Enjoy your meal.</i>

20:24.849 --> 20:28.144
Oh, well, thank you, Alyx.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.317
Although I'm not sure I'll ever
get used to technology

20:35.401 --> 20:37.278
calling me by my name.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.613
You get used to it.

20:39.697 --> 20:40.698
Trust me.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.121
The guardians.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.622
I had them trapped.

20:50.124 --> 20:51.876
Contained.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.004
The guardian code was almost mine!

21:01.260 --> 21:02.928
But I will catch them.

21:05.473 --> 21:06.640
Trap them.

21:09.852 --> 21:13.481
And I'll find out how they get
into cyber space.

21:13.856 --> 21:17.109
And then I will eliminate them.
