AT BABYLON WAS...

00:47.848 --> 00:49.778
TO DIE FOR.

00:54.855 --> 00:58.525

PLEASE SAY SOMETHING?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.361
- OKAY.

SO WE'RE MAKING OUT,

01:41.235 --> 01:43.265

I'M PICTURING HIM IN A SPEEDO

01:43.304 --> 01:45.314
WITH THE FLAG ON IT.

THEY LIVE IN THE SAND,

02:04.692 --> 02:07.762
BURROW THEMSELVES
RIGHT UP IN THERE.

02:09.396 --> 02:13.167
BRAZILIAN BEACH PARASITES
IN HIS ASS.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.902
- AN UNDERTAKER.
MM-HMM.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.543
- I FUCKED
AN UNDERTAKER ONCE.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.598
- YOU DID?
WHEN?

02:48.636 --> 02:53.406

PROMISE YOU WON'T LET THEM
SEW MY MOUTH SHUT?

WHEN HE SLEPT.

04:21.629 --> 04:25.799

HE'LL COME OUT OF IT.

I SAT BY HIS BED...

04:32.039 --> 04:33.509
ALL NIGHT.

04:33.541 --> 04:37.711
ABOUT 5:00 IN THE MORNING,
IT OCCURRED TO ME...

IF THERE WAS ANY CHANGE.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.880
THEY KEPT SHOWING HIM ON
THE BEACH WITH HIS SHIRT OFF.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.786
I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER
TO JERK OFF OR WEEP.

06:57.818 --> 07:01.558
- SO DID--
SO DID YOU, LIKE, PLAN IT?

07:01.589 --> 07:03.989

WE'RE ALL DOING IT, AND...

07:17.571 --> 07:19.541
HE EVEN TRIED TO FUCK ME.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.810
HIS LIFE'S LIKE THIS--
DOT ON A SCREEN.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.177
AND IT COULD BE US.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.975
- NO, IT COULD NOT BE US...

07:31.018 --> 07:33.748
BECAUSE WE KNOW BETTER.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.817
WE KNOW NOT TO BELIEVE
PRETTY LITTLE BLONDE BOYS

07:35.856 --> 07:38.686
WHO TELL YOU THAT
"IT'S REALLY GOOD SHIT,"

07:38.726 --> 07:41.726
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT THEY ALL SAY.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.232
TED DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.704
AND HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU
ONLY DO DRUGS WITH YOUR FRIENDS

07:46.734 --> 07:49.774
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES
THAT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.737
NOW I'VE TO GO TO WORK.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.106
I HAVE TO BE BRILLIANT.

08:07.254 --> 08:10.994
WHICH CAPTURES A PARTICULAR
AMERICAN YEARNING.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.594
AND WHAT DO I MEAN
BY THAT, HMM?

08:13.627 --> 08:15.197
- [laughs]

08:15.228 --> 08:18.898
- JUSTIN?

08:18.932 --> 08:23.172
- UH, YEARNING'S WHEN YOU
WANT SOMETHING REALLY BADLY.

08:23.203 --> 08:26.613
LIKE...
SO BAD, IT HURTS.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.580
- EXACTLY.

08:28.609 --> 08:32.609
IT NEEDS TO HURT
TO BE WORTHY OF THE WORD.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.275
OTHERWISE,
IT'S JUST WANTING,

08:34.313 --> 08:37.254
AS REPRESENTED
IN "THE GATSBY"

08:37.284 --> 08:40.924
BY THE GREEN LIGHT
ACROSS THE WATER.

YOU CAN SEE IT,
BUT YOU CAN'T TOUCH IT.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.831
MR. HOBBS.

08:50.864 --> 08:54.604
MR. HOBBS, ARE YOUR PARENTS
REALLY PAYING FOR YOU

08:54.635 --> 08:56.665
TO HAVE ANOTHER
TESTOSTERONE OUTBURST?

08:56.704 --> 08:58.944
- I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING.
- EXACTLY.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.212
BUT YOU WILL BE
AFTER SCHOOL.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.980
- I HAVE FOOTBALL PRACTICE.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.309
- NOT TODAY.

09:03.343 --> 09:06.683
TODAY YOU'LL BE CLEANING OUT
THE ATHLETIC ROOM.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.654
THE ONLY THING
WE FIGHT ABOUT IN THIS ROOM,

09:08.682 --> 09:11.052
MR. HOBBS...

09:11.084 --> 09:13.054
IS INTERPRETATION.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.194
- MRS. SCHMIDT,
WE'RE GOING TO WORK.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.755
I-IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN CALL ME
ON MY CELL PHONE, IF...

09:20.794 --> 09:23.664
- THEY SAID HE TOOK
AN OVERDOSE OF A--

09:23.697 --> 09:24.927
A DRUG I'VE NEVER HEARD OF.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.925
- WELL, HE WASN'T A--
A DRUG USER.

09:26.967 --> 09:30.667
- HE MUST HAVE MET SOMEONE
THAT NIGHT...

09:30.704 --> 09:32.844
AND TOOK HIM HOME.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.953
- MAY I ASK YOU SOMETHING,
MICHAEL?

09:37.978 --> 09:40.348
- SURE.

09:40.380 --> 09:44.820
- IF MY SON
HAD BEEN STRAIGHT,

09:44.852 --> 09:46.622
IF HE HAD TAKEN A WOMAN HOME,

09:46.654 --> 09:48.964
DO YOU THINK
SHE WOULD HAVE RUN OFF

09:48.989 --> 09:51.659
AND LEFT HIM THERE
TO DIE?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.343
- NEED SOME HELP?

10:08.375 --> 10:10.105
- [sighs]
THIS SUCKS.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.253
- YEAH.
THEY NEED YOU AT PRACTICE.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.109
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY DO?

10:14.147 --> 10:16.747
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
INTO, LIKE, SPORTS AND SHIT.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.094
- SOME.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.688
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU SURE KEEP IT A SECRET.

10:20.721 --> 10:24.661
I'M SUPPOSED TO GET ALL OF THIS
SHIT CLEANED UP OUT OF HERE.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.004
WOW.
YOU'RE PRETTY STRONG.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.799
- [chuckles]
THAT'S MY OTHER SECRET.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.002
- I CAN'T DO
THIS FUCKING COPY.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.774
- EXCUSE ME FOR BARGING IN.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.705
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.410
AS YOU MAY
OR MAY NOT KNOW,

10:41.441 --> 10:43.081
I'M TED'S LAWYER.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.340
- SO?

10:44.377 --> 10:46.807
- SO YOU NEED TO KNOW TED
MADE A LIVING WILL.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.947
DO YOU HAVE ONE?
- NO.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.182
- WELL, YOU SHOULD.

10:50.217 --> 10:54.187
BUT I'M NOT YOUR LAWYER,
I'M HIS.

10:54.221 --> 10:57.021
ANYWAY,
HE'S MADE YOU RESPONSIBLE.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.027
- FOR WHAT?

10:58.058 --> 11:00.928
- FOR DECIDING,
SHOULD HE EVER BE INCOMPETENT

11:00.961 --> 11:02.231
OR UNABLE
TO MAKE A DECISION,

11:02.262 --> 11:04.432
WHETHER TO BE KEPT ALIVE
BY EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES

11:04.464 --> 11:07.174
OR BE PERMITTED TO DIE.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.370
- ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT TED WANTS ME TO DECIDE

11:09.402 --> 11:11.142
WHETHER OR NOT
TO PULL THE PLUG?

11:11.171 --> 11:13.041
- I TRIED TO TALK HIM
OUT OF IT.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.443
- AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU
KNOWN ABOUT THIS?

11:14.474 --> 11:17.984
- IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW LONG.
- YEAH, IT DOES.

11:18.011 --> 11:21.751
I'M THIS SECRET YOU TWO
HAVE BEEN SHARING.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.152
WHEN WERE YOU PLANNING ON
TELLING ME?

11:23.183 --> 11:25.353
- I WAS HOPING
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO,

11:25.385 --> 11:27.445
THAT THE SITUATION
WOULD NEVER ARISE.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.817
- WELL, IT HAS.
IT'S ARISEN NOW.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.927
- AND NOW YOU KNOW.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.817
- SUZANNE SHEPLEY,
BIG WHORE--

11:57.851 --> 11:59.851
SHE'LL BLOW YOU,
BUT SHE WON'T FUCK

11:59.887 --> 12:01.287
IF YOU'RE IN THIS SCHOOL,

12:01.321 --> 12:04.491
ONLY IF YOU GO SOMEWHERE ELSE,
PREFERABLY CATHOLIC.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.394
- SHE SEEMED LIKE
A DYKE TO ME.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.026
- NO, MAN,
SHE'S NOT A DYKE.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.761
SHE'S A WHORE.
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.128
[both laugh]

12:16.269 --> 12:18.509
SO YOU KNOW
MARY FRANCES COTTALLUTTO?

12:18.538 --> 12:20.168
- HMM?

12:20.207 --> 12:22.477
- SO SHE COMES OVER TO INTERVIEW
ME FOR THE SCHOOL PAPER

12:22.509 --> 12:25.349
ABOUT BEING
THIS GREAT ATHLETE AND SHIT.

12:25.378 --> 12:29.148
AND IT'S 4:00, AND MY MOM
WON'T BE HOME TILL 6:00.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.788
SO I TELL HER
WHAT A TOUCHDOWN IS LIKE,

12:33.821 --> 12:35.261
AND THEN
SHE GRABS MY DICK.

12:35.288 --> 12:39.188
- NO.
- OH, YEAH, SHE WENT FOR IT.

12:39.226 --> 12:44.126
NOT ONLY THAT,
SHE UNZIPS MY FLY.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.574
SHE'S GOT MY DICK,

12:46.599 --> 12:48.469
AND SHE'S GOT
ALL THESE RINGS ON.

12:48.501 --> 12:52.811
THEY'RE COLD,
BUT HER HAND'S WARM.

12:52.840 --> 12:57.410
AND SHE'S RUBBING...
AND RUBBING.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.884
[panting]
OH, YEAH.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.884
AND THEN
SHE'S GOT TO GO HOME,

13:03.917 --> 13:08.287
YOU KNOW,
AND I'M THERE,

13:08.321 --> 13:10.361
AND I'M...

13:10.390 --> 13:12.330
- YOU'RE HARD.

13:12.359 --> 13:15.329
- [exhales deeply]

13:24.204 --> 13:28.844
[panting]

13:30.577 --> 13:33.547
[moaning]

13:36.383 --> 13:39.953
- * YOU KNOW I NEED,
'CAUSE THAT'S ALL I GOT *

13:39.987 --> 13:42.187
* COME ON

13:42.222 --> 13:43.622
[both moaning]

13:43.656 --> 13:47.556
* COME ON

13:47.594 --> 13:49.504
* COME ON

13:49.529 --> 13:50.999
- [moaning, gasping]

13:51.031 --> 13:53.631
- * COME ON

13:53.666 --> 13:55.236
- [grunts]

13:55.268 --> 13:59.538
- * COME ON

13:59.572 --> 14:03.082
- [panting]

14:03.110 --> 14:05.210
[door opens]

14:05.245 --> 14:08.215
- OH, SHIT.
[zipper closes]

14:10.517 --> 14:12.217
- SHOULDN'T YOU BE WORKING?

14:12.252 --> 14:16.492
- I, UH--
I AM WORKING, MR. HORNER.

14:16.523 --> 14:20.333
- HEY, GUYS.
- HEY.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.130
HOW COME I CAN'T GET MY GLUTES
TO LOOK LIKE THAT?

14:23.163 --> 14:25.503
- MAYBE YOU'RE NOT PROPERLY
VISUALIZING THE MUSCLE GROUP.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.272
- OH, I'M VISUALIZING IT,
ALL RIGHT--

14:27.300 --> 14:28.540
ON MY FACE.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.538
[both laugh]

14:33.040 --> 14:35.980
- [sighs]

14:36.009 --> 14:38.149
WHY ME?

14:38.178 --> 14:40.578
WHY NOT HIS MOTHER?

14:40.613 --> 14:41.683
WHY NOT YOU?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.954
- BECAUSE I CAN'T DECIDE
WHAT TO WEAR IN THE MORNING.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.224
WHO, IN THEIR RIGHT MIND,

14:45.252 --> 14:47.122
WOULD GIVE ME
POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH?

14:47.154 --> 14:49.294
- I COULDN'T DO IT,
EITHER.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.462
- I DON'T EVEN LIKE TED.
- OH, COME ON, YOU DO SO.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.962
- WELL, NOT ENOUGH
TO BE RESPONSIBLE

14:53.994 --> 14:54.964
FOR HIS FUCKING LIFE.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.025
- WELL, HE MUST HAVE WANTED YOU
FOR A REASON.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.004
- MAYBE HE'S SECRETLY
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

14:59.032 --> 15:03.142
- "I LOVE YOU. I'M COMATOSE.
KILL ME."

15:05.272 --> 15:07.912
- IT'S NOT OVER YET, BRIAN.
HE COULD STILL WAKE UP.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.478
- CHRIS?
NO WAY!

15:13.513 --> 15:16.553
- THEN DON'T BELIEVE ME.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.423
- BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE
IN LOVE WITH THAT BRIAN GUY.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.192
[rock music playing]

15:21.221 --> 15:24.721
- ME AND CHRIS--
THAT'S NOT LOVE, DAPH.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.487
THAT'S JUST FUCKING.
- [laughs]

15:27.527 --> 15:31.257
OH, AND I THOUGHT
IT WAS DETENTION.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.428
- JUSTIN?

15:33.466 --> 15:36.396
- WELL, I GOTTA GO.

15:38.071 --> 15:42.281
HEY, MRS. TAYLOR.
- HI, DAPHNE.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.079
- DIDN'T YOU HAVE ART CLUB
THIS AFTERNOON?

15:44.111 --> 15:45.581
- I QUIT ART CLUB.
[music stops]

15:45.612 --> 15:47.982
- YOU LOVE ART CLUB.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.115
- I'M NOT INTERESTED.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.619
- SINCE WHEN?
JUST LAST WEEK--

15:51.651 --> 15:54.051
- YOU DON'T KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME!

15:54.087 --> 15:56.057
A WEEK'S, LIKE,
A LONG TIME,

15:56.089 --> 15:59.729
THINGS CAN CHANGE
IN A WEEK.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.661
- WELL, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO KNOW I'M GOING TO NIKETOWN,

16:03.696 --> 16:07.566
BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY
NOT INTERESTED IN THAT EITHER.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.570
- WHEN?
- NOW.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.072
AND YOU CAN DRIVE.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.460
- WHAT?

16:34.494 --> 16:36.764
- JUST THE THING YOU DO
WITH YOUR HANDS...

16:36.796 --> 16:38.226
LIKE THIS.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.325
- I DO THAT, HUH?

16:39.366 --> 16:42.366
- YEAH, YOU DO.
- WELL, YOU SHOULD KNOW.

16:42.402 --> 16:45.642
- YEAH.
[sighs]

16:48.708 --> 16:52.778
- PEOPLE WAKE UP FROM COMAS,
SWEETHEART.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.512
- YEAH, SURE.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.217
- YOUR UNCLE VIC--
HOW LONG WAS HE IN HIS?

16:57.250 --> 16:59.520
- NINE DAYS?
- TEN.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.792
AND I THOUGHT I'D LOST HIM.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.661
I COULDN'T TELL YOUR GRANDMOTHER
IT WAS AIDS AT THE TIME

17:03.690 --> 17:05.060
BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T
HAVE DEALT WITH IT.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.262
I WANTED TO HEAR
ALL ABOUT THE WHITE LIGHT

17:06.292 --> 17:07.663
AND THE--THE TUNNEL

17:07.694 --> 17:11.263
AND--AND DID AUNT THERESA
GET TO HEAVEN?

17:11.298 --> 17:13.728
FIRST WORDS OUT OF HIS MOUTH,
"DID I MISS THE GOLDEN GLOBES?"

17:13.766 --> 17:17.165
[laughs]

17:20.772 --> 17:22.313
SO HOW IS HE?

17:22.342 --> 17:24.382
- THE SAME.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.681
NO CHANGE.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.324
I'M GOING TO GO BACK
A LITTLE LATER.

17:29.349 --> 17:33.149
I THOUGHT I'D TAKE SOMETHING
TO HIS MOM.

17:36.789 --> 17:40.459
- [sniffling]

17:40.493 --> 17:43.433
- WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

17:43.463 --> 17:45.533
- TURKEY MEAT LOAF...

17:45.565 --> 17:48.335
LEMON BARS--
THEY'RE GREAT TODAY.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.807
- YOU'RE A GOOD DRIVER.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.669
- BETTER THAN YOU.

17:54.707 --> 17:58.307
[both laugh]

17:58.345 --> 18:00.675
- OKAY, SLOW DOWN.
THIS IS A BIT TOO FAST.

18:00.713 --> 18:04.353
- THIS IS NORMAL, AND YOU
JUST SAID I WAS A GOOD DRIVER.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.393
WHAT?

18:08.421 --> 18:11.191
- NOTHING.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.634
IT'S JUST NICE--
YOU LAUGHED.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.130
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

18:16.163 --> 18:19.173
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU
COULD GET ANOTHER CAR,

18:19.199 --> 18:20.829
LET ME HAVE THIS
FOR SCHOOL.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.667
- OH, JUST HAND IT OVER, HUH?

18:22.702 --> 18:25.572
I WAS 20
BEFORE I HAD A CAR.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.835
I WAS GOING OUT
WITH JAY MCLAUGHLIN.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.384
HE COULD HAVE BEEN
YOUR FATHER.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.309
- THAT'S STUPID.
I WOULDN'T BE ME.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.184
- HE WAS
MY FIRST REAL BOYFRIEND.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.553
- I'D BE TOTALLY
SOMEONE ELSE.

18:34.581 --> 18:37.151
- LEARNED WITH HIM
WHAT A KISS REALLY WAS.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.894
- GROSS.
- [laughs]

18:38.918 --> 18:42.188
- DON'T TELL ME.
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.562
- WELL, NOW YOU DO.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.120
- [laughs]

18:48.528 --> 18:50.658
- SO DO YOU
HAVE A BOYFRIEND, JUSTIN?

18:50.697 --> 18:53.827
[tense music]

18:53.866 --> 18:58.766
*

18:58.805 --> 18:59.705
YOU CAN TELL ME.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.769
I PROMISE YOU,
I WON'T TELL YOUR FATHER.

19:01.808 --> 19:02.938
- I DON'T.

19:02.975 --> 19:06.245
- THEN WHO'S BRIAN?

19:06.279 --> 19:08.919
*

19:08.948 --> 19:10.918
[brakes screeching]

19:10.950 --> 19:12.790
*

19:12.819 --> 19:15.789
JUSTIN. JUSTIN!

19:15.822 --> 19:23.762
*

19:34.841 --> 19:38.951
- [clears throat]
MRS. SCHMIDT?

19:38.978 --> 19:40.008
- MICHAEL.

19:40.046 --> 19:43.716
- I DON'T MEAN TO BUG YOU.
UH, I BROUGHT YOU THIS.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.520
IT'S FROM MY MOM--

19:45.552 --> 19:47.752
MEAT LOAF
AND LEMON BARS.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.817
THE LEMON BARS
ARE REALLY GOOD.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.829
- WELL, THERE'S, UM,
STILL NO CHANGE.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.731
THEY'RE WATCHING
AND WAITING, SO...

19:57.764 --> 19:59.804
I THOUGHT I'D TAKE
A SMALL BREAK.

19:59.832 --> 20:04.402
- I'M SURE YOU COULD USE ONE.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.837
- HE MENTIONED A MICHAEL.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.613
- I SAID, UM,

20:08.641 --> 20:11.011
"TELL ME THE NAME
OF ONE SPECIAL FRIEND."

20:11.043 --> 20:14.313
AND HE SAID,
"WELL, THERE'S A MICHAEL."

20:14.347 --> 20:15.977
[chuckles]

20:16.015 --> 20:18.945
THANK YOU
FOR THE FOOD, DEAR.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.715
I'LL, UH,
STAY A BIT LONGER,

20:20.753 --> 20:22.623
AND THEN I'LL GO
TO HIS CONDO TONIGHT.

20:22.655 --> 20:26.355
- HIS CONDO?

20:26.393 --> 20:28.033
- OH, FOR PAJAMAS.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.900
I DON'T KNOW
IF HE EVEN WEARS THEM,

20:29.929 --> 20:31.729
BUT IF HE DOES,

20:31.764 --> 20:34.674
HE'LL NEED THEM
WHEN, UM...

20:43.843 --> 20:45.313
[cell phone rings]
- TORSO.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.575
- IT'S ME.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.383
- OH, MY GOD, IS HE DEAD?

20:48.415 --> 20:49.545
- NO, BUT HE'S
GOING TO WISH HE WAS

20:49.582 --> 20:51.752
WHEN HE FINDS OUT HIS MOM'S
GOING TO HIS CONDO TONIGHT

20:51.784 --> 20:52.694
FOR PAJAMAS!

20:52.719 --> 20:55.019
- OH, SHIT!
WHAT IF SHE FINDS HIS PORN?

20:55.054 --> 20:56.764
- AND HIS MAGAZINES!

20:56.789 --> 20:58.789
AND REMEMBER
HIS 33RD BIRTHDAY LAST YEAR?

20:58.825 --> 21:00.585
- [laughs]

21:00.627 --> 21:02.357
WHEN WE GAVE HIM
THOSE 33 DILDOS.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.595
THAT WAS HILARIOUS.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.300
- WELL, IT'S NOT SO FUNNY
ANYMORE!

21:05.332 --> 21:07.402
WE'VE GOT TO GO THERE
AND FIND ALL 33.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.974
- WAIT!
- WHAT?

21:09.001 --> 21:11.371
- WHAT IF HE'S GIVEN SOME
AS HOSTESS GIFTS?

21:11.404 --> 21:15.344
[knock at door]

21:18.878 --> 21:20.548
- I DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.320
- YOU HAVE TIME
TO KISS YOUR SON.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.600
- HEY, HONEY!
HIS BATH'S READY.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.059
OH.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.797
DID WE KNOW HE WAS COMING?

21:39.832 --> 21:41.072
- NO, WE DID NOT KNOW.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.040
- WELL, IT'D BE NICE
IF YOU'D CALL FIRST.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.540
AS I SAID,
HIS BATH'S READY.

21:45.572 --> 21:46.772
SO, IF YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE HIM--

21:46.806 --> 21:48.806
- I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
WHAT TED WANTS!

21:48.841 --> 21:50.781
I'M NOT DOING IT.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

21:50.810 --> 21:52.850
- [scoffs]
I TOLD HIM YOU'D BE THIS WAY.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.449
- HE HAS A MOTHER.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.421
- YEAH, WOULD YOU WISH THIS
ON YOURS?

21:57.450 --> 21:58.950
- HE HAS BETTER FRIENDS.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.585
- WELL,
THAT'S FOR GODDAMN SURE.

22:00.620 --> 22:01.850
- MELANIE,
WOULD YOU PLEASE--

22:01.888 --> 22:03.688
- LOOK, DID I BARGE IN HERE
AT BATH TIME?

22:03.723 --> 22:04.763
WAS THAT ME?

22:04.791 --> 22:06.631
- FUCK BATH TIME,
AND FUCK YOU!

22:06.659 --> 22:08.699
- HEY, FUCK YOU.
- JUST STOP IT! BOTH OF YOU!

22:08.728 --> 22:10.728
- SO LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE.
FIND SOMEBODY ELSE.

22:10.763 --> 22:13.873
HIS MOMMY OR MICHAEL
OR MADONNA--

22:13.900 --> 22:14.830
I DON'T CARE WHO!

22:14.867 --> 22:16.937
- BUT HE CHOSE YOU.
- WELL, HE CHOSE WRONG.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.669
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I SAID TO HIM.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.065
I SAID,
"BRIAN IS NOT THE PERSON

22:20.106 --> 22:21.806
"YOU WANT RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR LIFE.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.811
HE'S A SELFISH, NARCISSISTIC,
LITTLE FUCKING FAGGOT."

22:24.844 --> 22:26.884
AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU SUCK COCK.

22:26.913 --> 22:29.123
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
A LITTLE FUCKING COWARD!

22:29.148 --> 22:31.778
SO GO.
GET OUT! NOW!

22:31.818 --> 22:35.558
[baby fussing]

22:47.500 --> 22:51.100
- YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TALKING TO HIM THAT WAY.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.067
- "NO RIGHT"?

22:53.105 --> 22:55.735
TED IS LYING THERE,
ON LIFE SUPPORT.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.735
HE IS PROBABLY
NEVER GOING TO WAKE UP,

22:57.777 --> 23:00.547
AND HE IS DEPENDING ON BRIAN
TO SHOW HIM THE DECENCY,

23:00.580 --> 23:02.750
THE KINDNESS
TO RELEASE HIM.

23:02.782 --> 23:05.952
- THAT'S ALL THE MORE REASON
TO BE KIND.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.885
AFTER ALL, HE'S THE ONE
WHO HAS TO DO IT.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.791
THINK HOW HARD IT MUST BE...

23:10.823 --> 23:12.593
OR IF IT WERE ONE OF US--

23:12.625 --> 23:16.625
IF IT WAS ME LYING THERE
AND YOU HAD TO PULL THE PLUG.

23:16.663 --> 23:20.473
- [inhales deeply]
I'M NOT SURE I COULD.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.170
- MAYBE THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE SO ANGRY AT HIM,

23:22.201 --> 23:23.771
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
IF IT WERE YOU,

23:23.803 --> 23:26.843
YOU'D BE AS SCARED
AND ANGRY AS HE IS.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.782
[rock music]

23:37.817 --> 23:43.517
- * IF NOT TONIGHT,
THEN MAYBE NEVER *

23:43.556 --> 23:49.196
* NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT
STAYING FOREVER *

23:49.228 --> 23:51.798
* COME ON HOME

23:51.831 --> 23:54.801
* HOME TO ME

23:54.834 --> 24:02.844
*

37:00.852 --> 37:03.862
* TO NUMBER ONE

37:03.889 --> 37:09.729
*

37:09.761 --> 37:13.571
* SIX

37:13.599 --> 37:15.569
* LIPS

37:15.601 --> 37:17.671
*

37:17.703 --> 37:21.613
* FIVE

37:21.640 --> 37:23.340
* FINGERS

37:23.375 --> 37:25.735
- I'VE DECIDED.
- WHAT?

37:25.777 --> 37:28.677
- YOU AND ME--
WE'RE TAKING HIM HOME.

37:28.714 --> 37:31.484
- WHY YOU AND ME?
WHY--WHY ME AT ALL?

37:31.517 --> 37:33.587
- WELL, HE CAN HARDLY GO
WITH BRIAN.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.419
- AND IF I GO,
IT LOOKS A LITTLE...

37:35.454 --> 37:37.464
FAGIN AND OLIVER TWIST.

37:37.489 --> 37:39.689
- LEAVING ME, HUH?
THE HARMLESS ONE.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.585
THANKS A LOT.

37:47.065 --> 37:49.895
- I'M CALLING YOUR MOTHER.
I'M TAKING YOU HOME.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.665
- I'M NOT GOING.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.744
- YOU GET MY TITS IN A KNOT,
SUNSHINE,

37:54.773 --> 37:57.013
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE
IN DEEP SHIT.

37:57.042 --> 37:59.982
EXCUSE ME.

38:03.349 --> 38:06.079
- WHAT ARE YOU STUDYING
IN SCHOOL?

38:06.117 --> 38:07.087
- HMM?

38:07.118 --> 38:08.988
- IT'S CALLED CONVERSATION.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.560
- [chuckles]

38:13.525 --> 38:15.355
- READY?

38:15.394 --> 38:18.604
- I NEED TO TALK TO BRIAN.
I'LL BE THERE IN A SECOND.

38:28.974 --> 38:32.614
[door opens, closes]

38:32.644 --> 38:36.114
DO YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY?

38:36.147 --> 38:38.117
- NO.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.389
- WELL, I DO.

38:40.419 --> 38:41.619
YOU CAN FUCK HIM
AT YOUR PLACE.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.953
YOU CAN FUCK HIM
IN HIS GYM CLASS.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.518
YOU CAN FUCK HIM
AT THE ZOO.

38:44.556 --> 38:47.486
BUT YOU CANNOT FUCK HIM
IN MY MOTHER'S HOUSE...

38:47.526 --> 38:49.356
IN MY ROOM.

38:49.395 --> 38:52.525
- WE'RE WAITING!

38:54.866 --> 38:57.466
- OKAY, I'M GOING TO GO
DO THIS LITTLE JOB,

38:57.503 --> 38:59.003
AND THEN I'M GOING TO GO
SEE TED AT THE HOSPITAL.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.837
YOU DO WHATEVER
THE FUCK YOU WANT.

39:04.410 --> 39:05.910
[door opens]

39:05.944 --> 39:10.524
- NOBODY KNOWS IF IT'S
NATURE OR NURTURE, BEING GAY.

39:10.549 --> 39:11.649
NOW THEY'RE ALL SAYING
YOU CAN TELL

39:11.683 --> 39:12.853
BY THE LENGTH
OF THE INDEX FINGER,

39:12.884 --> 39:15.494
ALTHOUGH ALL OF MICHAEL'S
FINGERS ARE PERFECTLY NORMAL.

39:15.521 --> 39:16.921
HE SHOULD HAVE THREE KIDS
AND A BEER BELLY,

39:16.955 --> 39:19.785
AND HE'S ABOUT AS GAY
AS YOU GET.

39:19.825 --> 39:23.355
- MA, GIVE IT REST!

39:29.501 --> 39:32.071
[doorbell chimes musically]

39:32.103 --> 39:33.973
- LISTEN!

39:34.005 --> 39:36.905
THAT'S NICE, HUH?

39:36.942 --> 39:40.812
NOT LIKE THAT OLD BUZZER
AT OUR HOUSE.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.006
OH, HI!

39:42.047 --> 39:44.047
UM...

39:44.082 --> 39:46.082
I WAS ADMIRING YOUR CHIMES.

39:46.117 --> 39:48.517
YOU HAVE
A REAL NICE PLACE HERE.

39:48.554 --> 39:51.524
- OH, THANK YOU.
UH, YOU MUST BE--

39:53.525 --> 39:56.755
- RUDE LITTLE SHIT,
ISN'T HE?

39:56.795 --> 40:01.195
UM, I'M DEBBIE NOVOTNY.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.772
AND THIS IS MY GAY SON,
MICHAEL.

40:03.802 --> 40:07.772
- MA!

40:07.806 --> 40:09.906
- I'M JENNIFER TAYLOR.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.781
- JENNIFER.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.610
- HONEY?
WHO'S THERE?

40:13.645 --> 40:16.445
IT'S NO ONE!

40:21.052 --> 40:22.992
- LISTEN, UH...

40:23.021 --> 40:25.061
IF YOU EVER
NEED TO TALK TO SOMEBODY,

40:25.090 --> 40:27.190
I WORK OVER
AT THE LIBERTY DINER

40:27.225 --> 40:30.895
ON LIBERTY AVENUE...

40:30.929 --> 40:34.799
'CAUSE I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH...

40:34.833 --> 40:37.543
THE FINDING OUT.

40:39.505 --> 40:41.805
I MEAN, I ALWAYS KNEW
ABOUT MICHAEL.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.140
IN FACT, I TOLD HIM, RIGHT?

40:45.677 --> 40:49.947
TO SPARE HIM THE PAIN
OF HAVING TO TELL ME.

40:49.981 --> 40:51.921
SO...

40:51.950 --> 40:53.690
JENNIFER...

40:53.719 --> 40:56.759
DON'T ASK, "ARE YOU?"

40:56.788 --> 40:59.558
BECAUSE IT'S
NEVER A QUESTION.

40:59.591 --> 41:03.031
JUST SAY, "I KNOW."

41:03.061 --> 41:06.031
- UH, THANK YOU.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.667
[door closes]

41:10.702 --> 41:12.242
- YOU HAD TO SAY ALL THAT?

41:12.270 --> 41:14.240
- I WAS TRYING TO HELP.

41:14.272 --> 41:15.872
- YOU TRY TOO MUCH.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.980
YOU'RE STILL WEARING
THAT SAME OLD COAT.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.846
- SO SOMEDAY
YOU'LL BUY ME A MINK.

41:26.885 --> 41:27.885
[chuckles]

41:27.919 --> 41:29.789
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
A BIG SUCCESS.

41:29.821 --> 41:33.261
- YEAH, RIGHT.
YOU'LL FREEZE TO DEATH FIRST.

41:33.291 --> 41:35.861
- WHAT WAS THAT FOR?
- YOU CAN BE SUCH AN ASSHOLE!

41:35.894 --> 41:39.804
- WHAT'D I DO?
- YOU DON'T KNOW YOURSELF!

41:39.831 --> 41:41.971
"KNOW THYSELF."

41:42.000 --> 41:44.270
SOME GREEK SAID THAT.

41:44.302 --> 41:46.142
WHO WAS IT?

41:46.171 --> 41:48.871
- ZORBA?

41:48.907 --> 41:53.037
- I DON'T KNOW.

41:53.078 --> 41:55.678
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

41:55.714 --> 41:58.684
NOW TAKE ME HOME.

42:02.187 --> 42:03.887
- ARE YOU SURE
I CAN'T HELP?

42:03.922 --> 42:06.892
- I CAN DO IT.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

42:06.925 --> 42:08.785
- I WISH YOU'D LET ME
DRIVE YOU HOME.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.897
- I ALREADY
ASKED MY FRIENDS.

42:10.929 --> 42:14.769
- MICHAEL, EMMETT, BRIAN.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.767
I MET THEM
WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP.

42:18.804 --> 42:22.574
- OH.
- THEY'RE VERY NICE...

42:22.608 --> 42:24.978
ESPECIALLY MICHAEL.

42:25.010 --> 42:27.610
- YEAH, MICHAEL IS...

42:27.646 --> 42:30.116
ESPECIALLY SPECIAL.

42:30.148 --> 42:31.978
- ARE YOU TWO--

42:32.017 --> 42:33.277
I MEAN...

42:33.318 --> 42:34.888
- OH, NO.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.160
NO, WE, UH...

42:37.188 --> 42:38.258
HE'S JUST A FRIEND.

42:38.289 --> 42:41.289
- WELL,
HE'S A VERY GOOD FRIEND.

42:41.326 --> 42:43.626
HE WAS VERY KIND TO ME.

42:43.662 --> 42:45.302
I'M GRATEFUL YOU HAVE HIM.

42:45.330 --> 42:47.000
- YEAH, SO AM I.

42:47.032 --> 42:51.872
- BECAUSE MORE THAN ANYTHING,
I WORRY THAT YOU'RE ALONE...

42:51.903 --> 42:54.213
AND THAT THERE'S NO ONE
TO LOOK AFTER YOU.

42:54.239 --> 42:55.739
- I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

42:55.774 --> 42:57.184
- OH, I KNOW YOU CAN.

42:57.208 --> 42:58.978
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
SELF-SUFFICIENT.

42:59.010 --> 43:03.350
I JUST--I WISH YOU
HAD SOMEONE TO LOVE YOU.

43:03.381 --> 43:05.981
I MEAN, IF YOU DID, MAYBE
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

43:06.017 --> 43:09.687
- MOM, PLEASE.
LET'S, UH...

43:09.721 --> 43:11.261
- I'M SORRY.

43:11.289 --> 43:15.029
I KNOW THAT IT EMBARRASSES YOU
IF I TALK TOO MUCH OR...

43:15.060 --> 43:18.230
I GET TOO EMOTIONAL.

43:18.263 --> 43:21.803
BUT I CAN'T HELP
THINKING THAT...

43:21.833 --> 43:24.303
IF YOU HADN'T WOKEN UP,

43:24.335 --> 43:27.735
THEN I WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN
THE CHANCE TO LET YOU KNOW

43:27.773 --> 43:31.143
HOW PROUD I AM
THAT YOU'RE MY SON

43:31.176 --> 43:34.746
AND THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER
TO ME WHAT YOU ARE.

43:34.780 --> 43:39.080
OH, I GOT OVER THAT
A LONG TIME AGO.

43:39.117 --> 43:43.987
AND THAT WHENEVER
YOU'RE FEELING ALONE...

43:44.022 --> 43:47.162
OR THAT NO ONE LOVES YOU...

43:47.192 --> 43:50.302
THAT'S NOT TRUE...

43:50.328 --> 43:52.028
BECAUSE I DO.

44:00.171 --> 44:02.271
- THANK YOU...

44:02.307 --> 44:05.107
MOM, FOR, UH--
FOR SAYING THAT.

44:13.351 --> 44:15.051
- NOW, SAY IT THREE TIMES
AND CLICK YOUR HEELS--

44:15.086 --> 44:18.416
"THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME."

44:18.456 --> 44:20.426
- YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS
REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS--

44:20.458 --> 44:23.028
ALL THE FLOWERS
AND THE GROCERIES.

44:23.061 --> 44:25.101
- ONE-STOP SHOPPING
AT THE BIG Q-MART.

44:25.130 --> 44:27.370
- WELL,
IT'S--IT'S NICE.

44:27.398 --> 44:30.298
ONLY, CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHY I HAD TO STAY THERE

44:30.335 --> 44:32.165
THREE DAYS
AFTER I WOKE UP?

44:32.203 --> 44:34.313
- THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

44:34.339 --> 44:37.979
- ON YOUR BEST DAYS,
IT'S HARD TO TELL.

44:38.009 --> 44:41.149
- OKAY, JUST SO YOU
DON'T FREAK OUT...

44:41.179 --> 44:44.249
YOUR DILDOS ARE MISSING...
AND YOUR PORN.

44:44.282 --> 44:48.852
WE HAD TO MOVE IT ALL,
IN CASE YOUR MOM FOUND IT.

44:48.887 --> 44:52.757
- WELL, I EXPECT
ALL 33 BACK--CLEANED.

44:52.791 --> 44:55.931
- [laughs]

44:55.961 --> 44:58.961
YOU SHOULD EAT SOMETHING, HONEY.
- I'M NOT HUNGRY.

44:58.997 --> 45:01.127
- WE BOUGHT YOU
A WHOLE FUCKING CHICKEN.

45:01.166 --> 45:02.926
- AND YOU'RE GONNA EAT IT.

45:11.943 --> 45:14.983
- IT ALWAYS LOOKS
SO MUCH SMALLER.

45:15.013 --> 45:18.423
- WHAT DOES?
- YOUR LIFE...

45:18.449 --> 45:21.289
ESPECIALLY AFTER RETURNING
FROM A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE.

45:21.319 --> 45:23.119
- LIKE WATCHING THE OSCARS.

45:23.154 --> 45:24.824
"IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED BY..."

45:24.856 --> 45:27.086
both:
"THE BARBARA WALTERS SPECIAL."

45:27.125 --> 45:29.855
[both chuckle]

45:29.895 --> 45:31.995
- I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

45:32.030 --> 45:35.230
- YOU ARE?

45:35.266 --> 45:39.966
WELL, UH, I, UM...

45:40.005 --> 45:42.835
- WHAT?

45:42.874 --> 45:44.444
- UM...

45:44.475 --> 45:47.075
UH...

45:47.112 --> 45:50.282
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE TOO.

45:52.350 --> 45:54.490
AND IF YOU EVER
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS

45:54.519 --> 45:58.059
OR OTHER STUFF...

45:58.089 --> 45:59.519
- "OTHER STUFF"?

45:59.557 --> 46:01.287
- YOU KNOW,
IF THERE'S SOME--

46:01.326 --> 46:03.386
YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT.

46:03.428 --> 46:05.328
- LIKE WHAT?

46:05.363 --> 46:06.973
- I DON'T KNOW.

46:06.998 --> 46:11.198
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IF YOU TALK
ABOUT IT, IT MIGHT HELP IT.

46:11.236 --> 46:15.236
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT
NOT GET YOU WHAT YOU WANT...

46:15.273 --> 46:18.913
BUT...

46:18.944 --> 46:22.184
AW, SHIT.

46:22.213 --> 46:26.583
- ARE YOU GOING TO COME
EAT THE CHICKEN?

46:26.617 --> 46:29.047
- I'M GOING TO ARRANGE
THE DAISIES.

46:33.091 --> 46:34.591
- I SAW YOU...

46:34.625 --> 46:37.425
FUCKING...

46:37.462 --> 46:39.602
WHEN I WOKE UP.

46:39.630 --> 46:43.370
I THOUGHT...

46:43.401 --> 46:47.511
"I'M IN HELL,
AND THIS IS MY PUNISHMENT--

46:47.538 --> 46:51.478
WATCHING BRIAN KINNEY FUCKING
FOR ALL ETERNITY."

46:53.111 --> 46:56.051
- YOU SHOULD BE SO LUCKY.

46:56.081 --> 47:00.191
- [scoffs]

47:00.218 --> 47:03.588
- WHY ME?

47:03.621 --> 47:05.521
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE ME?

47:13.564 --> 47:16.234
- MY MOTHER COULDN'T DO IT.

47:16.267 --> 47:18.337
[scoffs]
MICHAEL AND EMMETT...

47:18.369 --> 47:20.209
COULDN'T DO IT.

47:20.238 --> 47:23.068
BUT YOU COULD,

47:23.108 --> 47:26.608
'CAUSE YOU'RE
A HEARTLESS SHIT.

47:26.644 --> 47:30.124
YOU COULD PULL THE PLUG,
AND YOU WOULDN'T CRY.

47:30.148 --> 47:32.178
AND YOU'D KNOW
WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO.

47:35.553 --> 47:37.493
- * LET'S GET SOAKING WET

47:37.522 --> 47:40.492
[dance music]

47:40.525 --> 47:48.465
*

47:52.270 --> 47:54.440
- I WANT IT TO BE YOU.

47:54.472 --> 47:55.472
- WHAT?

47:55.506 --> 47:57.676
- I WANT IT TO BE YOU!

47:57.708 --> 48:01.108
I'LL PUT IT IN WRITING.

48:01.146 --> 48:03.576
- I WANT IT TO BE YOU TOO.

48:03.614 --> 48:06.454
YOU PULL MY PLUG.

48:06.484 --> 48:08.654
- AND YOU PULL MINE.

48:08.686 --> 48:16.656
*

50:06.071 --> 50:08.011
- * COME ON

50:12.177 --> 50:14.407
* I WANNA HEAR IT

50:16.347 --> 50:18.277
* LET'S GET SOAKING WET
