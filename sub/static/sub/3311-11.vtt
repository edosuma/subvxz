WEBVTT

00:07.241 --> 00:09.710
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.712
HEY, ANYBODY GOT ANY ASPIRIN?

00:11.745 --> 00:14.648
MY HEAD IS JUST SPLITTING.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.518
HUH?

00:17.551 --> 00:20.388
OH, COME ON, YOU GUYS. YOU GUYS
USED TO LOVE THIS HALLOWEEN STUFF.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.656
AND I USED TO POOP IN MY PANTS.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.194
HEY HEY HEY.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.628
OOH, I LIKE WHAT YOU'VE
DONE WITH YOUR HAIR.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.197
YOU'RE PARTING IT A
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY.

00:29.230 --> 00:32.133
SEE? HERE'S SOMEBODY IN
THE HALLOWEEN SPIRIT.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.467
MY SPIRITS HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH HALLOWEEN

00:33.501 --> 00:34.768
AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.637
I JUST GOT MY PORSCHE
OUT OF THE REPO LOT!

00:36.670 --> 00:38.739
- YEAH, BABY!
- CONGRATULATIONS.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.741
IT MUST FEEL SO GOOD TO
HAVE YOUR PENIS BACK.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.046
GO AHEAD AND MAKE
YOUR JOKES, BURKE.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.481
THE LADIES, THEY
LOVE THE PORSCHE.

00:47.515 --> 00:48.616
YEAH, UNTIL THEY
MEET THE DRIVER.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.518
- YOU KNOW...
- HEY, WHOA.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.187
HOW ABOUT CHANNELING ALL THAT EXCESSIVE
MACHO INTO CARVING THIS PUMPKIN?

00:53.221 --> 00:56.023
NICE MOVE. INSULT ME AND
THEN GIVE ME A WEAPON.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.226
HEY, JOE, NOW THAT YOU
GOT YOUR CAR BACK,

00:58.259 --> 00:59.727
DO YOU HATE MY DAD ANY LESS?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.595
HATE THE MAN THAT MADE
ME LOSE EVERYTHING?

01:01.629 --> 01:04.198
NAH, NOT AT ALL.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.303
OOH, RIGHT IN THE SEEDS.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.739
SO DOES EVERYBODY HAVE THEIR
COSTUME READY FOR TOMORROW NIGHT?

01:11.772 --> 01:13.307
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT.

01:13.341 --> 01:16.244
I'M GOING AS A TEENAGER WHO
THINKS DRESSING UP IS LAME.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.581
I'M GOING AS HER BROTHER... THE
KID WHO COULDN'T CARE LESS.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.816
GUYS, IT'S HALLOWEEN.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.119
COME ON, REMEMBER HOW MUCH
FUN WE USED TO HAVE...

01:25.153 --> 01:27.121
SCARY, SUGAR-FILLED FAMILY FUN?

01:27.155 --> 01:29.123
COME ON, IF YOU CAN'T THINK
OF ANY COSTUME IDEAS,

01:29.157 --> 01:30.691
I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.728
BURKE, WILL YOU GIVE IT A REST?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.664
HEY, JOE, CAN I TALK TO
YOU IN THE OTHER ROOM?

01:39.133 --> 01:41.101
WHAT?

01:41.135 --> 01:42.770
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
I'M DOING HERE, DO YOU?

01:42.803 --> 01:46.474
YEAH. ANNOYING THE KIDS.
OH, AND ME.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.642
HALLOWEEN WAS ALWAYS A BIG
DEAL IN THEIR FAMILY.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.644
LENNOX AND RYDER
HAVE LOST SO MUCH.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.514
IT'S SO HARD TO LISTEN TO ANYTHING YOU
HAVE TO SAY WITH THAT AXE IN YOUR HEAD.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.749
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I JUST WANT THEM
TO HAVE A GREAT HALLOWEEN, OKAY?

01:55.783 --> 01:57.251
SO LET'S GO BACK IN
THERE AND PEP 'EM UP!

01:57.285 --> 01:58.719
I DON'T WANNA... EW.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.522
GUYS, JOE WAS JUST TELLING
ME THIS COOL HALLOWEEN STORY

02:01.555 --> 02:04.258
FROM WHEN HE WAS GROWING UP...
LONGO FAMILY CRAZY FUN.

02:04.292 --> 02:05.826
GO.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.762
WHA... UH, OKAY, SURE.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.832
WHEN I WAS A KID, ALL MY FRIENDS

02:11.865 --> 02:13.867
GOT THOSE COOL
STORE-BOUGHT COSTUMES.

02:13.901 --> 02:16.770
OOH WOW!

02:16.804 --> 02:19.773
ANYWAY, I REMEMBER ONE YEAR I
ASKED MY DAD IF I COULD HAVE ONE.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.875
YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID? HE
GRABBED TWO BROWN PAPER BAGS,

02:21.909 --> 02:23.744
TAPED 'EM TOGETHER, CUT
A HOLE OUT FOR MY HEAD

02:23.777 --> 02:26.447
AND SAID, "THERE YOU GO, SON.
YOU'RE GOING AS GROCERIES."

02:30.184 --> 02:33.621
- ( clenched ) THANKS A LOT.
- I'M GLAD I COULD HELP.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.856
- ( loud creak )
- DID YOU GUYS HEAR THAT?

02:35.889 --> 02:37.691
I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.760
NO NO, IT WAS THAT
CREAKING NOISE.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.662
THIS IS THE SECOND NIGHT IN
A ROW THAT I'VE HEARD IT.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.664
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'VE
HEARD THAT TOO.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.266
YOU KNOW WHAT IT COULD BE?

02:45.299 --> 02:47.635
( spooky voice ) THE
FOUNDATION SETTLING.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.705
IT'S NOT HOUSE SOUNDS. THERE
IS SOMETHING UP THERE.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.676
THERE IS. IT'S CALLED AN ATTIC.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.682
- ( creak )
- THERE IT IS AGAIN.

03:01.715 --> 03:05.219
MAYBE IT'S A RAT OR
A FAMILY OF RATS.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.488
JOE, IT'S THE HOUSE SETTLING.
THAT'S WHAT HOUSES DO,

03:07.521 --> 03:09.357
ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.159
THERE'S NOTHING UNUSUAL OR
WEIRD OR STRANGE ABOUT IT.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.395
( electricity buzzes )

03:15.796 --> 03:17.698
SORRY. MY IMAGINATION.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.269
♪ I GUESS ♪

03:21.302 --> 03:22.736
♪ YOU'RE STUCK ♪

03:22.770 --> 03:25.373
♪ WITH ME ♪

03:27.207 --> 03:30.544
HEY, YOU GUYS FIND ANYTHING
UP THERE, ANYTHING AT ALL?

03:30.578 --> 03:32.880
NOPE. I TOOK ONE END OF THE
ATTIC AND JOE TOOK THE OTHER.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.181
NOTHING.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.385
SO NO EVIDENCE OF
YOUR RODENT FRIENDS?

03:37.418 --> 03:39.953
NO RAT DROPPINGS OR A
LITTLE RAT CAMPFIRE

03:39.987 --> 03:42.256
OR A LITTLE DVD COPY
OF "RATATOUILLE"?

03:43.691 --> 03:45.693
I'M TELLING YOU THERE'S A RAT
UP THERE CHEWING ON A WIRE.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.728
JUST 'CAUSE WE DIDN'T FIND
DROPPINGS MEANS NOTHING.

03:47.761 --> 03:51.332
IT MEANS HE'S CONSTIPATED.
OR TOILET TRAINED.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.302
HEY, DID SOMEONE EAT
MY HALF A GRAPEFRUIT?

03:54.335 --> 03:57.405
UH, I THINK I DID.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.239
- BUT YOU HATE GRAPEFRUIT.
- SO?

03:59.273 --> 04:01.709
UNTIL RECENTLY SHE ALSO
HATED THE TASTE OF BEER.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.411
Both: WHAT?

04:03.444 --> 04:07.715
HE MEANS THAT I STILL
HATE THE TASTE OF BEER.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.683
UNLESS THEY'VE CHANGED
IT SINCE MY DAD GAVE ME

04:09.717 --> 04:11.452
ONE SIP WHEN I WAS EIGHT.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.220
- RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.956
BEER, EW.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.758
AND WHERE'S MY LITTLE
HUNK OF LASAGNA?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.793
DON'T YOU CALL ME THAT.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.865
- RYDER ATE IT.
- YEAH, I MUST'VE.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.734
BUT THAT WAS GOING
TO BE MY LUNCH.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.370
NOW I HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING
FROM THAT SANDWICH LADY

04:29.403 --> 04:31.405
WHO LOOKS LIKE JOHN GOODMAN.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.274
- ( doorbell rings )
- I'LL GET IT.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.612
WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING
ALL YOU PEOPLE LIVE WITH ME

04:38.646 --> 04:40.514
IF I HAVE TO ANSWER MY OWN DOOR?

04:40.548 --> 04:44.718
HI. MYRNA SHERWOOD FROM
JUST ACROSS THE STREET.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.620
- PINK HOUSE.
- OH YES.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.389
I LOVE ALL YOUR
LITTLE PLASTIC GEESE

04:48.422 --> 04:50.658
WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT
SEASONAL OUTFITS.

04:50.691 --> 04:54.495
THEY'RE LIKE MY CHILDREN.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.731
I GOT SOME OF YOUR
MAIL BY MISTAKE.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.667
OH, THAT'S SO THOUGHTFUL.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.569
WHEN I GET A NEIGHBOR'S MAIL,
I JUST TOSS IT IN THE...

05:01.602 --> 05:03.070
NEIGHBOR'S MAILBOX.

05:04.538 --> 05:07.675
- ( loud creak )
- YOU HEARD THAT, RIGHT?

05:07.708 --> 05:09.343
I AM TELLING YOU THERE
ARE RATS UP THERE.

05:09.377 --> 05:11.412
MYRNA, THIS IS MY NANNY JOE.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.713
JOE, MYRNA FROM
ACROSS THE STREET.

05:12.746 --> 05:13.847
- IS THAT THE GOOSE LADY?
- UH-HUH.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.616
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- HI.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.652
SO YOU'VE BEEN HEARING
NOISES IN THE ATTIC?

05:18.686 --> 05:23.290
JUST, YOU KNOW, CREAKING.
( mimics creak )

05:23.323 --> 05:26.794
WELL, NOT TO ALARM YOU,
BUT IT COULD BE...

05:26.827 --> 05:28.796
SOMETHING ELSE.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.798
LIKE WHAT?

05:30.831 --> 05:33.401
I'M SURE THE REALTOR
TOLD YOU EVERYTHING

05:33.434 --> 05:35.035
WHEN YOU BOUGHT THE HOUSE...

05:35.068 --> 05:38.506
ABOUT THE UNSPEAKABLE INCIDENT.

05:38.539 --> 05:41.375
OH, YOU MEAN ABOUT THE SWINGERS
THAT USED TO LIVE HERE

05:41.409 --> 05:42.676
THAT MADE THOSE MOVIES?

05:42.710 --> 05:45.345
DIFFERENT SOUNDS, HON.

05:47.114 --> 05:51.084
NO, YEARS AGO, A WIDOWER NAMED
GERHARD MUELLER LIVED HERE.

05:51.118 --> 05:54.588
QUIET MAN. NO ONE EVEN
NOTICED HE WAS GONE

05:54.622 --> 05:56.390
UNTIL ONE DAY A
TELEPHONE REPAIRMAN

05:56.424 --> 05:58.559
GLANCED IN THE ATTIC WINDOW.

05:58.592 --> 06:01.595
ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF
GERHARD WAS BONES.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.364
- AHHH!
- WHAT?

06:05.633 --> 06:06.967
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.369
IT SEEMS HE WENT UP
TO CHECK ON A NOISE,

06:09.403 --> 06:11.772
AND THEN HE FELL
AND NEVER CAME TO.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.408
AND THE RATS TOOK
CARE OF THE REST.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.710
SO THERE USED TO
BE RATS UP THERE.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.113
AND EVER SINCE, ALL
THE KIDS HAVE SAID

06:20.147 --> 06:21.649
THAT THIS HOUSE IS HAUNTED.

06:21.682 --> 06:25.686
BUT THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.020
ISN'T IT?

06:29.723 --> 06:32.826
WELL, ANYWAY, I NEED
TO GO AND GET READY

06:32.860 --> 06:34.495
FOR ALL THE LITTLE
TRICK-OR-TREATERS.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.897
- YOU STILL HAVE CANDY TO BUY?
- OH NO.

06:36.930 --> 06:40.568
I TURN OFF ALL THE LIGHTS
AND HIDE IN MY BATHROOM.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.104
HAPPY HALLOWEEN.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.645
- WELL, THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.
- YEAH, IT SURE DOES.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.481
I GOT A DISCOUNT ON THIS HOUSE

06:53.514 --> 06:55.483
BECAUSE SOME OLD GERMAN
GUY GOT EATEN BY RATS.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.085
YAY FOR ME!

06:58.118 --> 07:00.754
OR MYRNA'S STORY COULD EXPLAIN

07:00.788 --> 07:03.791
YOU KNOW, THE PRESENCE OF...

07:03.824 --> 07:07.394
WELL, SOMETIMES WHEN A TRAUMATIC
EVENT OCCURS SOMEWHERE,

07:07.427 --> 07:10.163
IT ACTUALLY ALTERS THE ENERGY OF
THAT LOCATION FOR A LONG TIME.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.766
MAYBE THERE'S A...

07:12.800 --> 07:15.636
- YOU KNOW, A...
- A WHAT?

07:15.669 --> 07:17.805
A SPIRIT.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.574
YOU MEAN A G-G-G-GHOST?

07:20.608 --> 07:23.611
LOOK, SCOOBY, A LOT OF INTELLIGENT
PEOPLE BELIEVE IN GHOSTS.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.979
NO THEY DON'T.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.182
I AM A VERY SKEPTICAL
PERSON BY NATURE,

07:29.216 --> 07:30.918
BUT I'M TELLING YOU THERE
ARE BOOKS AND ARTICLES.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.721
AND CARTOONS.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.689
YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET
I MENTIONED IT.

07:35.723 --> 07:38.125
NO NO, YOU SHOULD GO
TALK TO YOUR GHOST.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.927
I WILL, BUT NOT TILL TONIGHT.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.696
- WHY?
- BECAUSE IT'S BETTER TO TALK TO THEM WHEN IT'S DARK.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.733
BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN'T SEE THE
STRINGS AND SHEETS AND WHATNOT?

07:45.766 --> 07:48.636
THIS IS GONNA BE THE KIDS'
BEST HALLOWEEN EVER!

08:05.553 --> 08:07.955
HEY, AUNT MEL, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE DRESSING UP FOR HALLOWEEN.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.758
HAR HAR HAR.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.660
SERIOUSLY, YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE, RIGHT?

08:12.693 --> 08:15.095
SLUTTY INVESTMENT BANKER.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.599
WHAT? NO. I'VE GOT
A THING IN MY EAR.

08:18.632 --> 08:21.234
SLUTTY U.N. TRANSLATOR?

08:21.268 --> 08:24.972
COME ON, THERE'S STILL A BIG
BOX OF COSTUMES HERE, GUYS.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.807
WHO WANTS TO BE A HOBO?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.642
ISN'T THAT JUST LIKE
A HOMELESS PERSON?

08:28.676 --> 08:30.978
IT'S A JOLLY HOMELESS PERSON.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.146
WHAT ABOUT A NURSE?
LOOK, THAT'S SCARY.

08:33.180 --> 08:36.684
OOH, YOUR INSURANCE HAS EXPIRED!

08:38.719 --> 08:41.054
AUNT MEL, WE'RE JUST NOT DOING
THE WHOLE HALLOWEEN THING.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.858
OKAY, BUT IF YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND, IT'S HERE.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.563
ALL RIGHT, GOT THE CANDY
FOR THE TRICK-OR-TREATERS.

08:49.597 --> 08:52.232
- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING THAT.
- OF COURSE.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.734
HERE YOU GO.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.669
UH, WHERE ARE THE CANDY BARS

08:55.703 --> 08:57.805
AND THE PEANUT BUTTER CUPS?
THIS IS JUST...

08:57.838 --> 08:59.807
BLACK LICORICE AND
MORE BLACK LICORICE.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.875
OH WAIT. HERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT...
BLACK LICORICE!

09:01.909 --> 09:03.744
WHAT, WHO DOESN'T
LIKE BLACK LICORICE?

09:03.777 --> 09:05.613
UH, HUMAN BEINGS.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.682
I'VE GOT A REPUTATION
TO MAINTAIN.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.751
I AM KNOWN FOR MY
BADASS HALLOWEEN CANDY.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.220
I CAN'T BE PASSING
OUT SUCK LIKE THIS.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.222
BLACK LICORICE IS
VINTAGE AND CLASSIC.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.557
YEAH, CLASSIC CRAP.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.559
JOE, IF I GOT THIS
IN MY TREAT BAG,

09:19.593 --> 09:21.995
THERE WOULD BE A FLAMING
BAG OF DOG BUSINESS

09:22.029 --> 09:24.632
THROWN AT YOUR PORCH SO FAST.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.199
FINE. I'LL GO TO THE STORE
AND GET SOMETHING ELSE.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.201
NO, I'LL GO. OTHERWISE
YOU'LL JUST COME BACK

09:28.235 --> 09:31.104
WITH SOMETHING ELSE LAME LIKE
CANDY CORN OR LIVER TREATS.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.874
( creak )

09:33.907 --> 09:35.242
THERE'S YOUR GHOST BUDDY.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.810
DON'T YOU TWO HAVE A PLAY-DATE?

09:36.844 --> 09:38.646
NOT UNTIL IT GETS DARK.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.048
WHY? HE'S A GERMAN GHOST.
HE'S SIX HOURS AHEAD.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.083
YOU'D BETTER GET UP THERE.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.819
HEY WAIT. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
SUPPOSED TO BE, RIGHT?

09:47.755 --> 09:49.957
A PILOT FOR PORNO AIRLINES?

09:56.296 --> 09:58.065
( door creaks )

09:59.967 --> 10:02.670
HELLO?

10:02.703 --> 10:04.004
GERHARD?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.575
HI.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.944
MY NAME IS, UH, JOE.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.882
I KNOW YOU USED TO
LIVE HERE, GERHARD,

10:14.915 --> 10:17.885
AND I HATE TO BREAK
THIS TO YOU, BUT...

10:17.918 --> 10:20.821
UH, DUDE, YOU'RE DEAD.

10:22.656 --> 10:24.758
AND THIS IS NOT
YOUR HOUSE ANYMORE.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.661
NOPE, THIS IS... THIS
IS MY HOUSE NOW.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.731
ACTUALLY, IT'S MEL'S HOUSE.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.800
I WORK FOR HER.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.301
TECHNICALLY, I'M FREELANCE.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.803
IT'S AN ODD SITUATION, REALLY.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.705
I GOT CAUGHT UP IN THIS
BIG FINANCIAL SWINDLE

10:37.738 --> 10:40.373
AND LOST EVERYTHING AND THIS
WAS THE ONLY JOB I COULD...

10:40.407 --> 10:42.710
LIKE YOU NEED TO HEAR
ABOUT MY PROBLEMS.

10:42.743 --> 10:45.378
I'M GONNA TAKE DAD SOME MEATLOAF.
HE LIKES IT, RIGHT?

10:45.412 --> 10:48.081
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU
CAN KEEP THIS GOING?

10:48.115 --> 10:51.118
I THOUGHT WE WERE
IN THIS TOGETHER.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.653
OKAY, BUT AUNT MEL AND JOE
ARE GOING TO FIND HIM.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.255
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.290
OH, SO WHAT'S YOUR IDEA? YOU
WANT TO JUST TURN HIM IN?

10:57.324 --> 10:58.792
NO.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.861
TAKE HIM SOME OF
THAT TUNA CASSEROLE.

11:00.894 --> 11:04.197
- ISN'T HE ALLERGIC TO FISH?
- MM-HMM.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.702
AND EVEN THOUGH I CAN'T SEE
YOU OR HEAR YOU, GERHARD,

11:08.736 --> 11:12.005
I FEEL YOUR PRESENCE HERE.

11:12.039 --> 11:15.008
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT SCARED.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.278
NO, IN FACT, UNLIKE
OTHER PEOPLE,

11:18.311 --> 11:20.180
I WELCOME YOU, GERHARD.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.882
I WELCOME YOU INTO
MY HOME WITH...

11:21.915 --> 11:23.717
AH, WHAT THE...?!

11:26.186 --> 11:27.955
- SCANLON?
- JOE.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.823
- HEY, YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.
- I BET.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.124
IT'S NOT ENOUGH YOU
TAKE ALL MY MONEY.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.960
NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO
GIVE ME A HEART ATTACK?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.962
IN MY DEFENSE, I DIDN'T
EXPECT TO BE SEEN.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.697
THUS, THREE DAYS IN THE ATTIC.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.232
YOU'VE BEEN UP HERE
FOR THREE DAYS?

11:39.266 --> 11:41.234
YEAH, THE KIDS BROUGHT ME A HOT
PLATE AND A SPACE HEATER...

11:41.268 --> 11:43.804
ALL PLUGGED INTO ONE OUTLET. I'M
SORRY ABOUT THE BLINKY STUFF.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.272
TELL ME, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

11:45.305 --> 11:47.775
YOU RUINED MY LIFE. THERE,
WE'RE ALL CAUGHT UP.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.410
I UNDERSTAND. YOUR ANGER
IS TO BE EXPECTED.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.880
YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND YOUR
NOSE IS TO BE BROKEN?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.283
GO AHEAD. I DESERVE IT.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.819
OF COURSE, SEEING
MY FACE REARRANGED

11:58.852 --> 12:01.755
COULD BE KINDA TRAUMATIC
FOR RYDER AND LENNOX.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.791
DON'T YOU THINK YOU ALREADY
TOOK CARE OF THE TRAUMATIZING

12:03.824 --> 12:05.092
WITH THE RUNNING OFF
AND ABANDONING THEM?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.260
THE MONTHS I SPENT WITHOUT
THEM HAVE BEEN HELL.

12:07.294 --> 12:10.864
WELL, LET ME HELP YOU OUT. AFTER I BEAT
YOU SENSELESS, I'M GONNA TURN YOU IN.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.766
THAT'S FAIR.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.902
IT'S BEEN SO GREAT SEEING MY
KIDS THESE PAST FEW DAYS.

12:14.935 --> 12:18.071
I WAS REALLY JUST HOPING FOR
ONE LAST NIGHT WITH THEM.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.740
THEN I'LL TURN MYSELF IN.

12:20.774 --> 12:24.311
THAT'S ALL YOU WANT?
JUST ONE LAST NIGHT?

12:24.344 --> 12:27.014
IT WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO ME.

12:29.016 --> 12:32.385
WELL, IN THAT CASE...

12:32.419 --> 12:34.855
NO.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.756
I'M CALLING THE COPS. YOU SEE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED THERE?

12:36.790 --> 12:38.892
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO GET
SOMETHING GOOD AND THEN I SCREWED YOU.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.360
YOU KNOW, KIND OF
LIKE A PONZI SCHEME!

12:43.797 --> 12:45.866
HEY, GANG, WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?

12:45.899 --> 12:47.868
- NOWHERE.
- REALLY?

12:47.901 --> 12:49.736
- WHAT'S IN THE BAG?
- NOTHING.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.304
SO TAKING A BAG FULL
OF NOTHING NOWHERE.

12:51.338 --> 12:52.772
THAT'S BELIEVABLE.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.309
OKAY, HERE'S THE TRUTH.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.778
WE WERE SO INSPIRED BY YOU

12:58.812 --> 13:00.513
THAT WE DECIDED TO
CUT THIS BAG UP,

13:00.547 --> 13:02.950
MAKE IT INTO COSTUMES
AND GO AS GROCERIES.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.019
IT'S AN HOMAGE.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.487
I SAW YOUR DAD UP THERE.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.557
WHAT?! MY DAD HERE
IN THIS HOUSE?

13:13.894 --> 13:15.795
BACK OFF. HE'S NOT BUYING IT.

13:15.829 --> 13:18.398
YEAH. WELL, NOT NOW.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.268
COME ON, JOE, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO CALL THE COPS, ARE YOU?

13:21.301 --> 13:24.771
IT'S ONE LAST HALLOWEEN AND THEN
HE'S GONNA TURN HIMSELF IN.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.273
WE CAN'T PUT THIS OFF
ANY LONGER, RYDER.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.375
YOUR DAD BROKE THE LAW...
SEVERAL OF THEM.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.011
YEAH, WELL, IF THE LAW CAN'T GIVE A
KID A COUPLE HOURS WITH HIS FATHER,

13:31.044 --> 13:34.915
- THEN THE LAW BLOWS.
- DAD CAN'T RUN FOREVER.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.450
HE DESERVES TO GO TO JAIL.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.552
BUT RYDER DESERVES...

13:39.586 --> 13:42.789
WE DESERVE ONE LAST
NIGHT WITH HIM.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.557
PLEASE, JOE?

13:47.928 --> 13:49.897
( sighs ) YOU GUYS
GOT TILL MIDNIGHT.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.065
STAY UP THERE IN THE ATTIC AND
DON'T YOU BREATHE A WORD OF THIS

13:52.099 --> 13:54.001
TO YOUR AUNT MEL. I'LL
TELL HER YOU GUYS

13:54.034 --> 13:56.803
WENT TO A HALLOWEEN
PARTY OR SOMETHING.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.405
THANK YOU.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.042
DON'T MENTION IT. EVER.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.913
JUST FOR FUTURE REFERENCE, WHAT
COULD I HAVE DONE BACK THERE

14:05.946 --> 14:08.581
- TO MAKE THAT PERFORMANCE MORE BELIEVABLE?
- NOT BE LYING.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.254
( spooky music playing )

14:20.027 --> 14:23.096
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.
THEY'RE CALLED CANDY BARS.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.933
KIDS LIKE THEM 'CAUSE THEY DON'T
TASTE LIKE SUGAR-COATED TIRES.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.369
SO HOW'D IT GO WITH
THE GHOST UP THERE?

14:29.402 --> 14:31.972
WAS HE MORE WHITE AND
FLOATY OR GREEN AND SLIMY?

14:32.005 --> 14:34.474
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
DID YA BUST HIM?

14:36.076 --> 14:39.046
YOU KNOW WHAT? I HATE TO SAY
THIS, BUT YOU WERE RIGHT.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.981
THERE IS NOTHING UP THERE.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.849
SO IT WAS JUST HOUSE SOUNDS.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.018
YOU WERE TOTALLY
COMPLETELY RIGHT.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.587
OH MY GOSH, YOU SAW
SOMETHING UP THERE.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.622
( voice cracks ) NO, I DIDN'T.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.992
WHEN YOU LIE, YOUR
VOICE GOES HIGHER.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.394
- ( pitch raises ) IT DOES NOT.
- JOE.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.496
NOTHING!

14:56.529 --> 14:59.099
RATS.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.901
RAT.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.871
- LEWIS.
- LEWIS?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.007
LEWIS? LEWIS?!

15:07.040 --> 15:08.641
SCUMBAG LEWIS? HE'S IN MY ATTIC?

15:08.675 --> 15:10.910
YES YES YES YES, HE'S
UP THERE RIGHT NOW.

15:10.944 --> 15:11.979
ARE YOU JOKING?

15:12.012 --> 15:16.549
YEP, THIS IS MY HILARIOUS
HALLOWEEN PRANK.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.019
IT'S NO SEVERED HAND,
I'LL GRANT YOU, BUT...

15:19.052 --> 15:22.389
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
DO NOW, TURN HIM IN?

15:22.422 --> 15:25.058
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, WHY DID
YOU TELL ME HE WAS UP THERE?

15:25.092 --> 15:26.326
WHAT? YOU FORCED ME TO TELL YOU!

15:26.359 --> 15:28.061
YOU DID THAT THING WHERE
YOU LOOKED AT ME!

15:28.095 --> 15:30.063
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN!

15:30.097 --> 15:33.967
I CAN'T JUST CALL THE COPS.
THOSE POOR KIDS.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.502
NO, WAIT. I'M AN
ELECTED OFFICIAL.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.137
I CAN'T BE HARBORING A FUGITIVE.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.638
I'VE GOT NO CHOICE.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.040
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

15:40.073 --> 15:43.076
THE KIDS BEGGED ME FOR ONE
MORE NIGHT WITH THEIR FATHER.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.412
AND THEN HE PROMISED ME HE
WAS GONNA TURN HIMSELF IN.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.981
AND YOU BELIEVED HIM?
HE'S MANIPULATING YOU.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.649
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU FELL
FOR HIS CRAP AGAIN.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.285
I DID NOT FALL FOR
HIS CRAP AGAIN.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.221
I CAN'T BELIEVE I FELL
FOR HIS CRAP AGAIN.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.466
I CANNOT BELIEVE I FELL
FOR HIS CRAP AGAIN.

16:06.499 --> 16:09.969
HERE'S HOW YOU CAN TELL LEWIS IS LYING...
HE'S BREATHING.

16:10.003 --> 16:12.439
WHAT'S THIS? IT'S FROM LEWIS.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.274
HE SAYS HE TOOK THE KIDS
TO RICK DORAL'S HOUSE.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.709
THAT'S THAT AMAZING HALLOWEEN
PARTY THEY WENT TO EVERY YEAR.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.578
- THEN LET'S GO THERE AND GET THEM.
- IF THEY'RE THERE.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.580
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK HE
WAS TELLING THE TRUTH?

16:20.613 --> 16:22.649
OKAY, LET ME JUST
TAKE THAT BACK.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.384
HELLO, OFFICER?

16:24.417 --> 16:26.186
I NEED YOU TO SEND A POLICE CAR

16:26.219 --> 16:27.454
TO RICK DORAL'S
HOUSE ON LAKEVIEW.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.022
I DON'T KNOW THE ADDRESS,
BUT YOU CAN'T MISS IT.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.558
THERE'S LIKE 20 ZOMBIE-EATEN
BODIES IN THE FRONT DRIVEWAY.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.260
YEAH. I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.462
'CAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO
FIND LEWIS SCANLON THERE.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.264
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"JOIN THE CLUB"?

16:37.297 --> 16:38.965
WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHAT CLUB?

16:38.998 --> 16:41.401
SO WHAT IF LEWIS SCANLON IS A
POPULAR COSTUME THIS YEAR?

16:41.434 --> 16:43.470
I'VE GOT THE REAL ONE. I SWEAR!

16:43.503 --> 16:45.338
- ( line clicks, dial tone )
- HELLO? ( gasps )

16:45.372 --> 16:47.174
HEY, I VOTED FOR YOUR PAY RAISE.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.641
THAT'S IT. WE HAVE
TO GO TO THAT PARTY.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.743
I THOUGHT YOU DON'T BELIEVE
THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE THERE.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.011
I DON'T, BUT WE'RE DESPERATE.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.346
- ALL RIGHT.
- OH WAIT.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.681
IF WE'RE GOING TO
THE DORALS' HOUSE,

16:54.714 --> 16:55.715
YOU CAN'T GET IN
WITHOUT A COSTUME.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.184
FORGET THAT. WE DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR A COSTUME.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.985
COME ON. WHAT ARE YOU...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:59.018 --> 17:02.322
THERE. HA. YOU'RE MR. CLEAN.

17:02.355 --> 17:05.225
- LET'S GO.
- OH MY GOD.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.673
OH GREAT.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.609
SCANLON COULD BE INSIDE ANY
ONE OF THESE COSTUMES.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.245
- ( girl cackles )
- A TEENAGE WITCH.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.247
THAT'S CUTE. YOU SHOULD HAVE
DONE SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.182
OH, BEEN THERE, DONE THAT.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.284
ALL RIGHT, THEY ALWAYS DID
EVERYTHING IN A THEME.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.353
SO LOOK FOR THREE PEOPLE
IN A THEME-LIKE COSTUME.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.123
YOU KNOW, LIKE MARX BROTHERS,
TELETUBBIES, ANY OF THE GREATS.

17:36.156 --> 17:39.058
OH! WELL, THAT'S THEM!

17:39.092 --> 17:41.294
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YES, I'M SURE! GO.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.598
GOTCHA, LEWIS!

17:45.632 --> 17:48.735
OH, HEY. HI. THAT'S
A GREAT COSTUME.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.604
I HAD NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE.

17:51.638 --> 17:52.772
I STILL DON'T.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.474
HERE, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO PUT THAT BACK ON.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.144
ENJOY THE PARTY, GUYS.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.645
STILL THINK THAT
LOOKS LIKE LEWIS?

17:58.678 --> 18:00.613
- I TOOK A SHOT.
- NO, YOU DIDN'T TAKE A SHOT.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.482
YOU POINTED. I'M THE
ONE WHO TOOK THE SHOT.

18:02.515 --> 18:03.750
MEL, JOE, HAVE YOU
TRIED THE PUNCH?

18:03.783 --> 18:05.452
- LEWIS!
- LEWIS.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.687
ACTUALLY, TONIGHT I'M A COP.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.689
YOU, OF COURSE,
RECOGNIZE MY PRISONER,

18:09.722 --> 18:12.459
WHO WILL NOT SPEAK WITHOUT
HER DEFENSE ATTORNEY.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.361
IT'S BEEN AWHILE, LEWIS.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.063
SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED
THAT IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.766
I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD
THE CHANCE TO TELL YOU

18:19.799 --> 18:23.403
HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU LOOKING
AFTER THE KIDS THESE SEVERAL MONTHS.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.405
WELL, IT WAS KIND OF
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.607
YOU LIED TO ME, LEWIS. YOU TOLD ME
YOU WERE GOING TO STAY IN THE ATTIC.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.510
- I LEFT YOU A NOTE.
- DON'T BLAME MY DAD.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.212
WE ASKED HIM TO TAKE US HERE.

18:32.245 --> 18:35.482
WELL, SORRY, LEWIS,
BUT THE PARTY'S OVER.

18:35.515 --> 18:36.783
I FIGURED THAT.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.586
WE GOT WHAT WE WANTED...
ONE LAST NIGHT.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.354
DO YOU MIND IF I SAY GOODBYE?

18:41.388 --> 18:43.523
- MAKE IT QUICK.
- HOLD THIS?

18:44.824 --> 18:47.394
GUYS, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
GO AWAY FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

18:47.427 --> 18:49.396
BUT IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.231
AND I KNOW EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE OKAY

18:51.264 --> 18:54.534
BECAUSE YOU'RE GROWING UP
GREAT, YOU'VE GOT YOUR AUNT MEL

18:54.567 --> 18:56.703
AND YOU GOT MY OLD FRIEND MR.
CLEAN.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.639
I HATE THAT YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GO TO JAIL.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.209
AH, I'VE GOT LAWYERS.
MAYBE I'LL GET LUCKY.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.444
COME HERE.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.213
BYE, DADDY.

19:09.316 --> 19:13.453
- LEWIS SCANLON?
- AH. DIDN'T EXPECT YOU SO SOON.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.356
TURN AROUND.

19:16.389 --> 19:19.292
GUYS, I LOVE YOU. IT'S
ALL GONNA BE OKAY.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.427
REALLY.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.201
IT'S VERY COURAGEOUS
OF YOUR FATHER

19:28.235 --> 19:29.636
TO SURRENDER LIKE THAT.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.704
THINGS ARE GONNA BE A LOT BETTER

19:31.738 --> 19:34.474
NOW THAT HE'S DECIDED TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS ACTIONS.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.310
THAT'S WEIRD. LEWIS AND
THAT COP ARE LAUGHING.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.612
- AND WAVING.
- ( engine starts, revs )

19:39.646 --> 19:42.715
AND DRIVING OFF IN A PORSCHE.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.817
- THAT'S MY PORSCHE.
- ( car speeds off )

19:45.852 --> 19:47.654
HEY!

20:00.800 --> 20:02.535
WANT ME TO COOK YOU SOMETHING?

20:02.569 --> 20:04.537
NO, IT'S FOR RYDER.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.606
HE OUGHT TO EAT, BUT HE DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE COMING DOWN.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.408
HOW ARE YOU FEELING, HONEY?

20:08.441 --> 20:11.478
I'M NOT AS BUMMED OUT AS HIM,

20:11.511 --> 20:14.281
'CAUSE NOTHING MY DAD
DOES SURPRISES ME.

20:15.615 --> 20:19.419
JOE, DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE RYDER
THIS WEIRD NOODLEY STUFF?

20:19.452 --> 20:21.954
WEIRD? IT'S BAKED ZITI.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.924
YEAH, GO AHEAD. TAKE AS MUCH OF THE
WEIRD NOODLE STUFF AS YOU WANT.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.728
WOW, THIS MUST HAVE
REALLY MESSED WITH HER.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.464
SHE'S DOING SOMETHING
NICE FOR HER BROTHER.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.266
SCANLON IS ALL OVER
THE NEWS, BY THE WAY.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.767
APPARENTLY, HE MADE
A CLEAN GETAWAY.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.369
YOU KNOW THAT GUY POSING
AS THAT FAKE COP?

20:36.403 --> 20:38.738
HE'S THE ONE IN CHARGE OF ALL
OF HIS OVERSEAS ACCOUNTS.

20:38.771 --> 20:42.642
HEY, IF I HAD A BADGE LIKE THAT
"COP," WOULD THAT'VE HELPED?

20:42.675 --> 20:44.777
NO, I'M STILL LOST.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.414
I'M A SEXY SECRET SERVICE AGENT.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.919
YEAH, I GUESS I COULD SEE YOU
THROWING YOURSELF AT THE PRESIDENT.

20:54.521 --> 20:57.724
- BUT NOT TO PROTECT HIM.
- I'LL TAKE THAT.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.460
GOD, THIS IS REALLY GONNA
BE A TOUGH ONE TO GET OVER.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.862
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE YOUNG.
THEY'RE RESILIENT.

21:02.895 --> 21:05.332
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE KIDS.
I'M TALKING ABOUT ME.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.767
I HAD MY PORSCHE BACK
FOR LIKE ONE DAY!

21:09.436 --> 21:10.703
NOW I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHERE SHE IS

21:10.737 --> 21:12.705
OR IF THEY'RE TAKING
GOOD CARE OF HER.

21:12.739 --> 21:15.508
AW, POOR BABY.

21:15.542 --> 21:19.546
( theme music playing )
