WEBVTT

00:01.970 --> 00:05.210
ANNOUNCER: Previously
on "Big Brother."

00:05.210 --> 00:07.510
Before the marine
was discharged,

00:07.510 --> 00:10.010
he threw Mark and
Dominique under the bus.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.990
Thick as thieves off
to the side all the time.

00:18.870 --> 00:25.830
ANNOUNCER: With the
power up for grabs,

00:25.830 --> 00:30.360
it came down to Alex and
Elena, so a deal was struck.

00:33.550 --> 00:35.400
Yes.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.160
ANNOUNCER: Making Alex
the star of the stars.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.680
You are the new HOH.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.720
ANNOUNCER: Despite the
house gunning for her,

00:42.720 --> 00:45.510
Jessica convinced Jason
she could be an asset.

00:45.510 --> 00:47.260
If she wants to send me
home, then I'll go home.

00:47.260 --> 00:49.190
She's not leaving
a mark on this game

00:49.190 --> 00:52.800
by evicting someone
who has zero allies.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.320
ANNOUNCER: And the cowboy was
buying what she was selling.

00:58.860 --> 01:01.410
We've got Jessica here and if
you don't put her on the block,

01:01.410 --> 01:03.360
then she'll be in
number for our side.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.820
ANNOUNCER: But the gamer
had a different strategy.

01:05.820 --> 01:07.650
Jessica has to
be on the block.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.350
We can backdoor
someone, that's fine.

01:12.350 --> 01:16.090
But she has to be on the block.

01:16.090 --> 01:19.660
ANNOUNCER: Paul and Alex decided
to secretly work together.

01:19.660 --> 01:23.700
We could be teammates but
play a totally different game.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.220
I want to work with you.

01:25.220 --> 01:27.340
ANNOUNCER: So he filled
her in on Cody's intel.

01:27.340 --> 01:28.040
-

01:28.040 --> 01:29.640
Dom and Marc are
definitely up to something.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.300
One thousand percent.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.890
I would rather target Dom first
before Mark because, honestly,

01:36.890 --> 01:38.870
I think Dominique is
more of a competitor

01:38.870 --> 01:40.340
and more of a
threat in this game.

01:40.340 --> 01:42.130
ANNOUNCER: Due to
their deal, Elena

01:42.130 --> 01:44.450
told Alex who she wanted safe.

01:44.450 --> 01:50.660
I want to protect Mark, Raven,
Matt, Dominique, and Paul.

01:50.660 --> 01:52.520
That's a lot of
people to protect.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.710
I need to find a way to make
Elena feel comfortable putting

01:54.710 --> 01:56.210
up one of her own on the block.

01:56.210 --> 01:58.790
ANNOUNCER: But Alex warned
that Dom and the Teddy bear

01:58.790 --> 02:00.290
could be in danger.

02:00.290 --> 02:02.930
There are a couple people
that are red flags for me.

02:02.930 --> 02:04.610
Dominique and Mark right now.

02:04.610 --> 02:07.460
Obviously I'm not
going to endorse that.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.240
ANNOUNCER: Hoping to gain favor
with the head of household,

02:10.240 --> 02:13.940
I've been sensing that
something is not right.

02:13.940 --> 02:17.120
ANNOUNCER: Dominique implied
an ally had betrayed her.

02:17.120 --> 02:20.060
There are some
people, or a person,

02:20.060 --> 02:22.100
that is somewhat
insecure as it relates

02:22.100 --> 02:25.880
to me and the other
person's friendship.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.420
Even though she's
not mentioning names,

02:27.420 --> 02:30.440
it's very obvious that she's
trying to have a name Elena.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.270
ANNOUNCER: And it
sealed her fate.

02:32.270 --> 02:33.970
So So I was already sketched
out about Dominique,

02:33.970 --> 02:35.760
but now she's throwing
people from her own side

02:35.760 --> 02:36.830
of the house under the bus?

02:36.830 --> 02:40.580
That's super not cool
and a red flag for me.

02:40.580 --> 02:42.610
ANNOUNCER: At the
nomination ceremony,

02:42.610 --> 02:45.330
I have nominated you,
Jessica, and you, Dominique.

02:45.330 --> 02:48.750
ANNOUNCER: Alex set the stage
to decimate the Dominator.

02:48.750 --> 02:51.060
Now that Paul and I are
working secretly together,

02:51.060 --> 02:52.530
nobody's going to
see this coming.

02:52.530 --> 02:53.820
We're going to flip
the house and make

02:53.820 --> 02:55.740
sure everyone goes home but us.

02:55.740 --> 02:59.020
Tonight, with the power
of veto on the line,

02:59.020 --> 03:02.250
will Jessica or
Dominique secure safety?

03:02.250 --> 03:05.640
Plus, another night,
another fight.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.890
You're going home though,
I guarantee you that.

03:07.890 --> 03:10.200
Real smug coming from the
person who is on the block

03:10.200 --> 03:11.310
right now.

03:11.310 --> 03:15.550
ANNOUNCER: All this
right now on Big Brother.

03:15.550 --> 03:18.350
I literally feel like
this is the Hunger Games.

03:57.950 --> 04:00.150
This nomination
ceremony is adjourned.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.170
I nominate Dominique
to take a number away

04:09.170 --> 04:10.480
from the other side.

04:10.480 --> 04:13.250
And I nominated Jessica
because the whole house

04:13.250 --> 04:15.370
wanted retribution for
what Cody had done.

04:15.370 --> 04:18.380
And plus, I don't really
like Jessica, so sorry.

04:21.780 --> 04:25.260
It doesn't get worse than
last week so I'm ready.

04:25.260 --> 04:26.760
I've been preparing for this.

04:26.760 --> 04:27.990
So now I just have
to go out there

04:27.990 --> 04:31.050
and win this veto because
I can only rely on myself.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.540
I knew something was up.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.280
Although Alex put
me up on the block,

04:37.280 --> 04:40.050
I have a feeling some people
on my side knew about it.

04:40.050 --> 04:41.760
And I'm going to get
to the bottom of it,

04:41.760 --> 04:42.490
you can bet on it.

04:45.730 --> 04:47.570
You OK, big girl?

04:47.570 --> 04:49.020
Mhm

04:49.020 --> 04:52.640
If you need me at any point,
you know where to find me.

04:56.250 --> 04:57.980
But everything's repairable, so.

05:02.020 --> 05:04.860
Hello houseguests, this is
your puppet-master speaking.

05:04.860 --> 05:05.890
What are we going to do?

05:05.890 --> 05:07.830
We're going to get
Dominique out, right?

05:07.830 --> 05:10.650
Yeah, yes get Dominique
out yes, Paul, yes.

05:10.650 --> 05:12.960
Dominique, yay!

05:12.960 --> 05:14.210
Hey, yeah giver her some time.

05:25.350 --> 05:26.050
You awake?

05:29.540 --> 05:30.880
Why do you think I'm here?

05:30.880 --> 05:34.920
I'm still assessing it
because, again, I'm pissed.

05:34.920 --> 05:38.010
Paul is involved.

05:38.010 --> 05:39.550
Paul cannot be this blind.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.480
Yeah.
- Mhm.

06:14.590 --> 06:16.390
Dom's one of the sweetest
people I've ever met.

06:20.490 --> 06:23.440
And it hurts me.

06:23.440 --> 06:26.390
She really feels
like a sister to me.

06:26.390 --> 06:27.400
She's in a tough spot.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.090
But you're not going home.

06:39.090 --> 06:42.350
Cause if there's anything
that I can do, there's veto.

06:42.350 --> 06:43.050
Yep.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.980
I'm in the restroom
praying and I'm

06:59.980 --> 07:03.540
having a conversation with God
asking him, God, what is up?

07:03.540 --> 07:06.750
Who is it?

07:06.750 --> 07:08.410
Who is the person behind this?

07:08.410 --> 07:13.980
I'm praying.

07:13.980 --> 07:15.250
I'm praying.
I'm praying.

07:15.250 --> 07:21.220
Amen.

07:21.220 --> 07:24.470
And all of a sudden I hear
Paul's name three times.

07:27.100 --> 07:32.760
I exit the bathroom, and to my
surprise guess who's waiting?

07:32.760 --> 07:33.460
Paul.

07:37.830 --> 07:39.990
I d-- this is the
only time that I can

07:39.990 --> 07:41.700
probably find a
moment with you before

07:41.700 --> 07:43.620
anybody tries to bum rush you.

07:43.620 --> 07:45.040
Mhm.

07:45.040 --> 07:50.770
If I had to strategize
it was one person

07:50.770 --> 07:51.880
that really wanted me out.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.020
- Yes.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.470
I am hoping I
am not the person

08:00.470 --> 08:01.300
who you are referring to?

08:01.300 --> 08:02.260
I'm hoping that, too.

08:04.980 --> 08:07.050
I'm hoping you still have the
same trust in me that you have

08:07.050 --> 08:09.790
had, or at least the
same amount of respect

08:09.790 --> 08:11.370
that if you were
to think something

08:11.370 --> 08:13.040
you would come straight
to me and ask me.

08:18.010 --> 08:21.090
Would you ever in
your life betray me?

08:21.090 --> 08:22.210
No.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.860
- Have you been dishonest--
- I have not.

08:23.860 --> 08:25.000
About anything?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.620
I can only play
an honest game.

08:27.620 --> 08:32.280
Dishonesty does not work
for my personal game.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.330
Yeah.

08:34.330 --> 08:37.260
Last season I was tossing
out friendship left and right.

08:37.260 --> 08:39.870
But it came to stab me in
the back quite a few times.

08:39.870 --> 08:41.200
And I took a lot of bullets.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.030
I'm not here to get stabbed
and if that means playing

08:43.030 --> 08:45.100
a little bit of a sneakier
and more strategic game,

08:45.100 --> 08:47.080
then that's just
what it has to be.

08:47.080 --> 08:49.650
So why do you think someone
would want to betray me.

08:49.650 --> 08:51.160
I need your honest opinion.

08:51.160 --> 08:54.640
I genuinely don't know but
I'm telling you, personally,

08:54.640 --> 08:56.260
Dominique, that it's
coming to a point

08:56.260 --> 08:59.920
where I might have
to abandon ship.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.070
This is the week of the
downfall of our group.

09:02.070 --> 09:02.770
Watch.

09:02.770 --> 09:05.110
Actually, this entire
week I've praying like,

09:05.110 --> 09:06.640
God, you got to show
me who I can trust,

09:06.640 --> 09:09.900
you got to show me
who I can trust.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.690
So God's with me.

09:11.690 --> 09:13.590
And I will not leave
this house until it's

09:13.590 --> 09:14.880
time for me to leave the house.

09:14.880 --> 09:15.710
No matter how many stabs

09:15.710 --> 09:17.430
Amen to that.

09:17.430 --> 09:18.690
It's going to come out though.

09:18.690 --> 09:19.650
It's gonna come out.

09:19.650 --> 09:21.400
I'm certain of that.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.550
At this point, I'm
certain Paul is the snake.

09:24.550 --> 09:27.070
However, I've got a veto
competition coming up.

09:27.070 --> 09:30.220
So I'm going to wait it out
and I'm going to expose him

09:30.220 --> 09:32.260
at the right time.

09:32.260 --> 09:33.970
Well, I'm gonna
give you your space.

09:33.970 --> 09:35.670
You have a big competition.

09:44.960 --> 09:45.660
Hey guys!

09:45.660 --> 09:47.610
It's time to pick players
for the veto competition.

09:49.550 --> 09:50.510
All righty.

09:56.810 --> 09:58.490
Only six people
will participate in

09:58.490 --> 10:00.590
the veto competition,
the head of household,

10:00.590 --> 10:02.240
the two nominees, and
three other players

10:02.240 --> 10:03.680
selected by random draw.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.120
Will the nominees
please join me up here?

10:09.840 --> 10:11.980
I want to pick either
Jason or Paul to play.

10:11.980 --> 10:13.100
Jason's my ride or die.

10:13.100 --> 10:14.410
And Paul's an my
secret alliance.

10:14.410 --> 10:15.910
So, if either one
of them get picked,

10:15.910 --> 10:18.340
we can work together to get
Dominique out of this house.

10:18.340 --> 10:20.890
I, as head of household,
and the two nominees

10:20.890 --> 10:22.660
will each pull a
chip out of the box

10:22.660 --> 10:24.910
to determine that three
other players competing

10:24.910 --> 10:26.650
in the veto competition.

10:26.650 --> 10:28.560
As, HOH, I will pick first.

10:34.550 --> 10:35.840
Kevin.

10:35.840 --> 10:36.790
Good job, Kevy!

10:36.790 --> 10:38.680
Yeah, Kev, all right!

10:43.450 --> 10:45.370
I'm just dying to
get picked right now

10:45.370 --> 10:47.970
because I want to save Dominique
and I want to keep myself safe

10:47.970 --> 10:49.900
as well.
She's an amazing person.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.290
And I really like
having her in the house.

10:51.290 --> 10:53.920
And I don't want to
see her go this week.

10:53.920 --> 10:57.190
Christmas.

10:57.190 --> 11:00.670
I get picked to play the veto
competition and I'm stoked,

11:00.670 --> 11:03.070
but also a little concerned.

11:03.070 --> 11:05.750
Just got into the
house, just had surgery,

11:05.750 --> 11:07.180
hopefully it's something
that I get to play

11:07.180 --> 11:08.120
and not have to sit out.

11:14.300 --> 11:16.390
Houseguest's choice.

11:16.390 --> 11:18.740
Uh, I pick Jason.

11:18.740 --> 11:21.710
Yeah!

11:21.710 --> 11:24.260
Jason and I have been
getting a little closer,

11:24.260 --> 11:25.820
especially since Cody left.

11:25.820 --> 11:27.980
I'm really hoping that
he chooses to take me

11:27.980 --> 11:30.170
off the block, should he win.

11:30.170 --> 11:32.680
Big Brother will inform us when
the competition is to begin.

11:32.680 --> 11:33.380
Good luck.

11:42.550 --> 11:44.540
What do you want us to do?

11:44.540 --> 11:46.080
Do you want to just throw it?

11:46.080 --> 11:47.540
No.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.270
I think picking players
went fairly well.

11:49.270 --> 11:51.730
Jason's my ride or die, and
Kevin's in my inner circle.

11:51.730 --> 11:53.710
We're going to make sure one
of us wins the power of veto

11:53.710 --> 11:55.900
so we can get rid of
Dominique this week.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.960
If I win the veto,
I'll pull Jessica off.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.530
Alex it's too risky.

12:05.530 --> 12:07.480
She has to go home and we
have to win the power of veto,

12:07.480 --> 12:08.290
pull Jessica o--

12:08.290 --> 12:09.580
I don't know about that.

12:09.580 --> 12:11.700
If you don't pull her off
it's going to be five to five.

12:11.700 --> 12:13.040
And if we--

12:13.040 --> 12:14.950
Raven?

12:14.950 --> 12:17.990
Put up Raven so they'll
have to vote for her.

12:17.990 --> 12:18.760
That's a good point.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.390
Jessica's public
enemy number one.

12:20.390 --> 12:21.530
You cannot leave her up there.

12:21.530 --> 12:23.410
They're going to vote her off.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.300
I want to take Jessica
down and put up Raven.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.140
She's an angel.

12:26.140 --> 12:29.410
No one in their right mind is
going to vote to evict Raven.

12:29.410 --> 12:32.580
That's a 100% guarantee
that Dominique will go home.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.270
When Dominique sees
Raven go up, she's just

12:34.270 --> 12:37.150
couldn't read the bible
til the end of the day.

12:37.150 --> 12:39.430
That's what I mean but that's
why it's almost imperative

12:39.430 --> 12:42.660
that you put Raven up there.

12:42.660 --> 12:45.110
Putting Raven up would just,
like, make everyone like,

12:45.110 --> 12:46.330
seem sketched out about me.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.470
So I'm not so sure.

12:47.470 --> 12:49.210
Why don't we just
leave it all the same?

12:49.210 --> 12:50.140
Let's just do this.

12:50.140 --> 12:54.610
First thing first, let's
just win the power of veto.

12:54.610 --> 12:56.970
Try your hardest, try your
hardest, try my hardest.

12:56.970 --> 12:58.040
She's got to go home now.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.270
She's got to go home.

13:18.860 --> 13:21.940
Oh, this looks so fun!

13:23.350 --> 13:24.320
Crazy!

13:24.320 --> 13:26.270
So I walk into
the backyard and I

13:26.270 --> 13:29.900
feel like it's a Tarzan
meets Indiana Jones meets

13:29.900 --> 13:32.170
gymnastic competition vibe.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.210
And as excited
as I am to find out

13:40.210 --> 13:42.190
who's going to win
this veto competition,

13:42.190 --> 13:44.140
I'm more excited
to figure out why

13:44.140 --> 13:46.620
there are so many squirrels.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.450
The ground is lava.

13:48.450 --> 13:50.620
Oh literally, I just got that.

13:50.620 --> 13:54.750
Treasure hunters, welcome
to the temple of temptation.

13:54.750 --> 13:58.030
Christmas, unfortunately,
the doctor has not medically

13:58.030 --> 14:00.090
cleared you to compete
in this competition,

14:00.090 --> 14:02.330
so you must sit out.

14:02.330 --> 14:03.770
I am a competitor.

14:03.770 --> 14:06.740
And this is like one of my
strongest assets in this game.

14:06.740 --> 14:09.560
And so I'm just
feeling frustrated

14:09.560 --> 14:12.340
because I love to compete.

14:12.340 --> 14:14.240
Like, I don't care
that I broke my foot.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.420
I just care that I can't
give everything to this.

14:20.290 --> 14:22.180
Legend has it that
the one brave enough

14:22.180 --> 14:25.480
to go back and forth
across the lava 50 times,

14:25.480 --> 14:27.830
touching the sacred
squirrel on each trip,

14:27.830 --> 14:31.240
will be blessed with the
golden power of veto.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.810
Here's how it works.

14:32.810 --> 14:36.040
At the sound of the gong, make
your way across your suspended

14:36.040 --> 14:37.990
beam over the lava pit.

14:37.990 --> 14:40.090
Once to the other
side, press the button

14:40.090 --> 14:43.150
on your sacred squirrel
statue to earn one point.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.310
You must then
return, on your beam,

14:45.310 --> 14:47.170
back to the start
platform and run

14:47.170 --> 14:51.310
around your sacred posts before
traveling back across the lava.

14:51.310 --> 14:54.550
The first player to make 50
trips, earning 50 points,

14:54.550 --> 14:58.560
will be blessed with the
golden power of veto.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.320
But beware, if you
fall into the lava pit,

15:01.320 --> 15:03.800
Benny will be very unhappy.

15:03.800 --> 15:08.440
Your score will reset to
zero and you must start over.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.460
Now, this is the
temple of temptation

15:11.460 --> 15:13.920
after all, at any
point in the game,

15:13.920 --> 15:17.160
the first player to lift
their chalice of cha-ching

15:17.160 --> 15:19.140
will receive a cash prize.

15:19.140 --> 15:20.400
But you will
immediately eliminate

15:20.400 --> 15:22.410
yourself from this competition.

15:22.410 --> 15:24.590
So who's ready to play
temple of temptation?

15:32.250 --> 15:33.210
Whoa.

15:33.210 --> 15:34.310
Nice save.
Nice save.

15:34.310 --> 15:35.440
They didn't say
the thing moved.

15:42.640 --> 15:43.340
Whoa.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.960
50 times we'll be
here til tomorrow.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.570
Whoa.
What the?

16:02.570 --> 16:04.000
Dammit.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.990
This veto is
extremely important.

16:05.990 --> 16:08.150
I need to win the veto so we
can have all the power to send

16:08.150 --> 16:10.060
Dominique home this week.

16:10.060 --> 16:11.640
Good job, Alex.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.060
There you go Dom.

16:13.060 --> 16:16.780
I'm a survivor and I
need to with this veto

16:16.780 --> 16:19.210
because my life in this
game is on the line.

16:19.210 --> 16:20.640
I know who the snake is.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.910
And I want to have opportunity
to chop off its head.

16:27.690 --> 16:29.570
Holy--

16:29.570 --> 16:31.480
Whoa.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.460
I really want to win
the veto this week.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.840
The only person I can trust
to take me off the block

16:35.840 --> 16:36.540
is myself.

16:41.290 --> 16:45.700
- Shake it off, Jess.
- Kevin, what the--

16:45.700 --> 16:47.290
Man, mine is
shaking ..

16:47.290 --> 16:48.660
This is broken over here.

16:48.660 --> 16:50.710
This is broken over here.

16:53.190 --> 16:56.110
That was simple.

16:56.110 --> 16:58.010
Kevin, you're beating
Christmas by one.

16:58.010 --> 17:00.100
Oh!

17:03.070 --> 17:05.440
Focus, Kevin.

17:05.440 --> 17:09.260
I really want to win this comp
just because I can't afford let

17:09.260 --> 17:12.000
Dominique get that
power of veto,

17:12.000 --> 17:13.700
cause if she gets a hold
of that power of veto

17:13.700 --> 17:18.170
and pulls herself off the block,
Alex and I are in big trouble.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.940
So I'm keeping my core tight,
my feet fast, and that lava's

17:20.940 --> 17:21.780
never going to touch me.

17:24.870 --> 17:27.500
I know that this is a
teeter-totter competition.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.640
My strategy, goes
slow and steady,

17:29.640 --> 17:31.740
figure out how much
this thing gives,

17:31.740 --> 17:35.500
and walk across until you
make it onto the platform.

17:35.500 --> 17:36.200
Whoa.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.790
Kevin, what the--

17:41.790 --> 17:43.150
Don't ask me, man.

17:43.150 --> 17:46.800
Yeah, this is
harder than it looks.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.390
Walk around the poll.

17:48.390 --> 17:49.360
Kevin!

17:49.360 --> 17:51.030
Aw, man.
I didn't walk around the poll?

17:51.030 --> 17:52.300
- No.
- Damn, they got me confused.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.740
Looks like Kevin
hopped in the lava.

18:01.740 --> 18:02.910
What does that
mean back to zero?

18:02.910 --> 18:03.980
Back to zero, buddy.

18:03.980 --> 18:06.190
Kevin go for it, man.

18:06.190 --> 18:09.770
Kevin's playing in the veto
and it is the funniest thing

18:09.770 --> 18:12.540
I've ever seen in my life.

18:12.540 --> 18:15.400
I think Kevin knows he's not
supposed to fall in the lava

18:15.400 --> 18:18.610
but at this point the
lava is his friend.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.780
The competitions going on
and I'm not doing too good,

18:24.780 --> 18:26.590
so I'm debating in
my mind, should I

18:26.590 --> 18:27.940
take the temptation or not?

18:34.020 --> 18:36.000
Congratulations,
Kevin, you have claimed

18:36.000 --> 18:37.560
the chalice of cha-ching.

18:37.560 --> 18:41.940
Since this ancient temple
was erected in 27 a.d.

18:41.940 --> 18:44.040
You'll be showered with
the wealth and riches

18:44.040 --> 18:45.670
in the amount of $27.

18:47.870 --> 18:50.020
Do I get it tonight?

18:50.020 --> 18:51.610
I don't know.

18:51.610 --> 18:53.050
So this summer I've
been really bringing

18:53.050 --> 18:55.960
in the cash, $25,000
the first comp,

18:55.960 --> 18:58.940
and now this one
I hit it big $27,

18:58.940 --> 19:08.020
making a total sum of $25,027.00
going back to Boston with me.

19:08.020 --> 19:09.200
Drinks on you, pal.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.480
You got it.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.390
Jason's at 22.

19:16.390 --> 19:18.000
Alex is at 19.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.030
Dominique's at 13.

19:20.030 --> 19:22.550
And Jess is picking
up the pace at 12.

19:22.550 --> 19:24.830
This is still anybody's game.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.150
Who's going to bring
on the heat and bring

19:27.150 --> 19:28.150
home the power of veto?

19:35.430 --> 19:38.080
Everyone's looking great.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.630
I'm moving along on the beam.

19:39.630 --> 19:41.300
It seems to be
going pretty well.

19:41.300 --> 19:45.040
I may have a shot at
winning this thing.

19:45.040 --> 19:48.420
Hang on, hang on, hang on!

19:48.420 --> 19:52.330
And then, I plummet.

19:52.330 --> 19:53.800
Jesus, pick up the phone.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.780
I know you hear it ringing!

19:55.780 --> 19:56.890
I need your help!

20:02.940 --> 20:04.020
Nice, Dom way to fight, girl!

20:09.050 --> 20:12.400
I know I'm behind, but I
do still believe in miracles.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.100
Nice!

20:16.060 --> 20:20.040
What a valiant effort by
Dominique in saving herself!

20:20.040 --> 20:22.060
Thank God I'm
back on this beam.

20:22.060 --> 20:23.910
Jesus, you answer the phone.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.150
What a save by Jessica!

20:42.600 --> 20:45.960
Looks like Jessica is really
feeling the heat on this one.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.370
Can she save herself?

20:52.890 --> 20:56.440
Jessica has taken a huge
step back at zero points.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.900
Nice, Dom.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.430
Keep pushing, girl.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.840
I'm watching this
right now and I just

21:06.840 --> 21:09.720
hope Dominique can step
it up a couple notches

21:09.720 --> 21:12.520
and somehow pull this out and
keep herself safe for the week.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.400
So, she can come off the
block, and the target

21:14.400 --> 21:15.590
can go back on Jess.

21:27.960 --> 21:28.950
She's gonna fall off.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.990
And Dominique
goes down, bringing

21:38.990 --> 21:41.000
her score down to zero.

21:41.000 --> 21:41.940
Focus, girl.

21:41.940 --> 21:43.420
It sucks!

21:43.420 --> 21:45.800
Right now I'm behind
Alex and Jason.

21:45.800 --> 21:46.670
But you know what?

21:46.670 --> 21:48.860
At any point,
someone could fall.

21:48.860 --> 21:51.620
And I'm hoping that happens.

21:51.620 --> 21:54.750
Jason's in the lead but
Alex is right behind him.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.280
Jason wants to pull
Jessica off of the block

21:59.280 --> 22:01.200
and I want to leave
nominations the same.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.060
So even though Jason
are working together,

22:03.060 --> 22:06.040
I just would feel more secure
if I had the veto at this point.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.770
I have to do what's
best for myself.

22:10.380 --> 22:11.900
It's coming down to the wire.

22:11.900 --> 22:14.760
I'm in the lead now, but one
wrong step, that plank goes out

22:14.760 --> 22:16.690
from under me, I
land in the lava pit,

22:16.690 --> 22:18.780
bam, my points go back to zero.

22:18.780 --> 22:22.110
I got to make sure I maintain
this lead, get that veto,

22:22.110 --> 22:25.990
because I want to
take Jessica down.

22:25.990 --> 22:30.110
Only one point separates
Jason and Alex at 43 and 44.

22:35.030 --> 22:36.620
Take your time.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.470
Five more Jason.

22:38.470 --> 22:42.990
Easy

22:42.990 --> 22:45.010
Alex and Jason are tied at 49.

22:50.150 --> 22:52.090
Damn!

22:52.090 --> 22:54.050
Yeah!

22:54.050 --> 22:56.050
Congratulations,
Jason, you have

22:56.050 --> 22:58.420
won the golden power of veto.

23:02.630 --> 23:06.630
Yee-haw So this is what it
feels like to have bling-bling.

23:06.630 --> 23:08.620
So now Alex and I have
got all the power maybe

23:08.620 --> 23:11.920
I can use the veto to a
use some of that power

23:11.920 --> 23:13.670
in my, favor get somebody
else on the block.

23:17.630 --> 23:20.280
Good job, buddy.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.200
Jason wins the
power of veto and I'm

23:22.200 --> 23:23.730
not too happy about that.

23:23.730 --> 23:26.850
My life in this game has
been placed in his hands.

23:26.850 --> 23:29.190
All I can do is talk to Jason.

23:29.190 --> 23:31.680
That's the only saving
grace for my game right now.

23:34.750 --> 23:36.760
Even though I didn't
win the power of veto,

23:36.760 --> 23:39.220
I'm still hoping that I'm
not the target this week.

23:39.220 --> 23:42.250
So I'm going to try and lay low
and stay off people's radar.

23:42.250 --> 23:45.170
And hopefully, someone
else pops up on theirs.

23:45.170 --> 23:46.490
- You beast.
- Thank you, thank you.

23:46.490 --> 23:49.150
Jason wins the veto which
is great for our plan,

23:49.150 --> 23:51.070
but with Jason,
you never know what

23:51.070 --> 23:53.350
he's thinking because
sometimes he can be irrational.

23:53.350 --> 23:57.550
That could really, really
jeopardize my game.

23:57.550 --> 23:59.770
Jason wins the veto and
that's excellent because Jason

23:59.770 --> 24:01.000
does whatever Alex says.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.080
And Alex and I are
secretly working together.

24:03.080 --> 24:05.150
So now all I have to do is
come up with a game plan.

24:16.100 --> 24:17.350
Preheat the oven.

24:17.350 --> 24:18.340
Girl, I'm on it.

24:18.340 --> 24:20.360
I'm on it!
- Good job.

24:20.360 --> 24:21.240
Thank you, buddy.

24:21.240 --> 24:22.990
Killed it.

24:22.990 --> 24:24.980
It's great that
Dominique's up on the block.

24:24.980 --> 24:28.100
But I can't risk any chances
of Mark batting for her,

24:28.100 --> 24:30.110
rallying up some
votes or protecting

24:30.110 --> 24:31.770
her in this situation.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.800
So, I need Jason
to use the veto,

24:33.800 --> 24:38.960
pull Jessica off and have Alex
replace Jessica with Mark.

24:38.960 --> 24:43.000
So in order to do
this, I've got a plan.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.540
First thing I need
to do is convince

24:44.540 --> 24:48.250
Alex to put up Mark as a pawn.

24:48.250 --> 24:51.000
OK, we are not going to
have much time to talk.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.490
Think about this, pull Jess off.

24:54.490 --> 24:59.250
If you put Mark next to Dom,
you are taking away a vote,

24:59.250 --> 25:01.560
and securing one
at the same time.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.340
Think about it.

25:03.340 --> 25:06.250
Mark is the only person
who's going to bat for Dom.

25:06.250 --> 25:09.920
And mark is going to be
campaigning to keep her in.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.170
It is an A plus move.

25:12.170 --> 25:13.760
OK, but I'm going
to need

25:13.760 --> 25:15.650
everyone in on this plan.

25:15.650 --> 25:17.670
I'm telling you, everyone
will be in on it, deal?

25:17.670 --> 25:21.380
- Yeah.
- Dude, great job.

25:21.380 --> 25:22.860
Good work, kid.
- Yeah.

25:28.960 --> 25:32.120
The next thing I need to do
is go to Jason and tell him,

25:32.120 --> 25:34.370
hey, I think Alex has a plan.

25:34.370 --> 25:36.320
Maybe you should go
talk to her about it.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.560
You heard Alex's plan?

25:37.560 --> 25:38.950
No.

25:38.950 --> 25:41.440
Well she explained it to me
and it kind of makes sense.

25:41.440 --> 25:45.520
Think about this, Mark still
very much still backing Dom.

25:49.100 --> 25:50.860
Elena would never vote
against Mark, right?

25:50.860 --> 25:52.970
Right?

25:52.970 --> 25:55.370
So if you guys have a
conversation with Mark

25:55.370 --> 25:57.700
and say hey, look we're
just using you as a pawn.

25:57.700 --> 25:58.400
I don't know.

25:58.400 --> 26:01.460
No, dude, you guys are power, I
don't give a-- but if you want

26:01.460 --> 26:04.040
my advice, when Alex told
me it, I was like, damn,

26:04.040 --> 26:05.880
that's kind of a smart idea.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.580
This conversation cannot
go anywhere, dude.

26:07.580 --> 26:08.280
I know.

26:08.280 --> 26:10.420
I would just say Alex I
think that's a good idea.

26:10.420 --> 26:11.120
OK.

26:20.550 --> 26:22.720
We need the numbers.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.210
It's your HOH, Al.

26:24.210 --> 26:27.420
I know but we have to
make this a strategic move.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.040
OK, Dom's up there.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.430
We have to stick with we
have to send her home.

26:31.430 --> 26:34.470
OK?
Remove all doubt.

26:34.470 --> 26:35.850
And the last
thing I need to do

26:35.850 --> 26:38.700
is make them believe that this
was pretty much their plan.

26:38.700 --> 26:42.030
And they're now involving
me and I'm like, hey,

26:42.030 --> 26:43.470
that's not a bad plan.

26:43.470 --> 26:45.240
I wonder who thought of it?

26:45.240 --> 26:47.390
Me.
Alex--

26:47.390 --> 26:48.090
Yes?

26:48.090 --> 26:49.710
The only way I'm
agreeing with your plan--

26:49.710 --> 26:50.410
Yes.

26:50.410 --> 26:53.740
Is if you tell Mark beforehand
and he completely knows.

26:53.740 --> 26:55.920
Does Mark have any inkling
of what we want to do.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.650
Mark has no inkling, which
is why I'm telling you,

26:58.650 --> 27:03.180
I agree this plan could work
but only if you let him know.

27:03.180 --> 27:04.950
I'm going to go downstairs
right now, I can get Mark.

27:04.950 --> 27:06.580
- Let's do this.
- OK, stay here.

27:14.930 --> 27:16.840
Let's say that.

27:16.840 --> 27:19.060
- Yeah, yeah fine.
- OK.

27:25.490 --> 27:29.390
No, I know you're
not going to like this.

27:32.420 --> 27:34.990
Let us explain why.
- Dom.

27:38.660 --> 27:41.890
Because, buddy, I'm sorry
but people are questioning

27:41.890 --> 27:43.840
where your vote's gonna land.

27:43.840 --> 27:47.140
But Paul will never
vote against you.

27:47.140 --> 27:49.070
- That's one.
- Jason.

27:49.070 --> 27:51.250
And me, I'll never vote.

27:51.250 --> 27:53.800
Elena that's three.

27:53.800 --> 27:57.430
I don't feel safe
as a pawn in any way.

27:57.430 --> 27:58.910
- Hi Elena.
- Hello.

28:03.330 --> 28:04.820
What's up?

28:04.820 --> 28:06.770
I can't believe this
is happening right now.

28:06.770 --> 28:09.220
Not only is my best
friend on the block,

28:09.220 --> 28:12.260
but they want to use me as
a pawn to get rid of her.

28:12.260 --> 28:14.450
If I'm up on the block, people
are going to have the chance

28:14.450 --> 28:15.650
to take a shot at me.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.690
I just can't let that
happen right now.

28:17.690 --> 28:19.730
I understand that you're
asking me to be a pawn.

28:19.730 --> 28:22.220
And in most situations,
I'd be OK with it.

28:24.840 --> 28:28.250
Because what I'm hearing
is both sides of the house

28:28.250 --> 28:31.840
have a problem with
what Cody said about me.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.640
Come on, buddy.

28:32.640 --> 28:36.170
It is a scary thing, but
if people assure you,

28:36.170 --> 28:37.490
take the leap of faith.

28:37.490 --> 28:39.060
I did and guess what?

28:39.060 --> 28:41.040
I'm HOH.

28:41.040 --> 28:41.980
You won POV.

28:41.980 --> 28:44.020
You guys are clearly a team.

28:44.020 --> 28:45.850
You guys need to protect
yourselves moving forward.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.790
Who do you want gone?

28:47.790 --> 28:49.380
I want Dom

28:49.380 --> 28:53.910
Just to clarify I'm not
campaigning for or against Dom.

28:53.910 --> 28:56.180
But I'm not going to evict Dom.
- OK.

28:56.180 --> 28:57.810
And if you guys
can't live with that,

28:57.810 --> 28:59.410
then you're going to have
to put me up as a pawn

28:59.410 --> 29:00.240
But that will not change.

29:12.910 --> 29:16.360
Jason holds the veto and
I want to get off the block.

29:16.360 --> 29:22.240
I feel like if I tell Jason
about this snake in the house,

29:22.240 --> 29:25.030
Jason will develop
trust and then maybe

29:25.030 --> 29:27.040
he'll use that veto on me.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.530
Whatever was said in this
room is not leaving this room.

29:36.670 --> 29:38.350
- Hello.
- 'Sup girl.

29:38.350 --> 29:40.310
Hi.

29:40.310 --> 29:42.280
Cowboy, I want to talk to you.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.950
Do you all want more time?
- No.

29:43.950 --> 29:44.650
Sure?

29:44.650 --> 29:45.610
Yeah.

29:45.610 --> 29:46.610
OK.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.530
Bye now.

29:48.530 --> 29:50.150
It's only going to
take a couple of minutes.

29:53.210 --> 29:55.140
She's putting the
pressure on people.

29:59.260 --> 30:00.760
You know, I'm trying
to gather information.

30:00.760 --> 30:04.180
I'm pretty sure you probably
know concretely more than I do.

30:04.180 --> 30:06.140
I would never bet that but--

30:06.140 --> 30:08.110
Yeah, I mean, but
you're in the mix

30:08.110 --> 30:13.000
so it's very apparent that I've
been betrayed by my own people.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.350
It is my hope that
you can see that.

30:21.660 --> 30:27.630
So this is the thing, I
know who the snake is.

30:27.630 --> 30:30.640
I can't say.

30:30.640 --> 30:35.440
Pay attention and I ask
you to go with your gut.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.870
Is it a man or a woman?

30:42.810 --> 30:45.230
I mean, why would you
want to protect the snake?

30:45.230 --> 30:50.510
I don't but I need some
other things to unravel.

30:50.510 --> 30:51.820
I've got that power of veto.

30:51.820 --> 30:53.750
And we'll get to
the bottom of it.

30:53.750 --> 30:56.330
You know that whole thing
about keep your friends close

30:56.330 --> 30:58.610
but you're enemies closer?

30:58.610 --> 31:01.640
So pay attention to those
who are getting close to you.

31:01.640 --> 31:05.620
And hear me when I say, you will
know exactly who the snake is.

31:05.620 --> 31:07.950
It's so crazy.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.480
I'm gonna go back up there.

31:09.480 --> 31:10.350
OK.

31:10.350 --> 31:11.210
OK, Dom.

31:11.210 --> 31:12.200
Thank you, I appreciate it.

31:18.020 --> 31:19.470
And he has returned.

31:19.470 --> 31:21.210
Did you bite your tongue
as much as you could?

31:21.210 --> 31:24.740
I didn't say or
did I just listen.

31:24.740 --> 31:25.440
OK.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.220
And?

31:27.220 --> 31:29.290
She referred to a snake.

31:29.290 --> 31:30.920
Did she ever give
you names or no?

31:30.920 --> 31:32.310
No.

31:32.310 --> 31:37.880
No she said, keep your friends
close and your enemies closer.

31:37.880 --> 31:40.230
I'm pretty sure she thinks
the snake is in this room.

33:10.960 --> 33:14.300
She's talking about
a snake and a tempter.

33:14.300 --> 33:15.270
It's something about Paul.

33:15.270 --> 33:17.050
And now she wants
a house meeting?

33:17.050 --> 33:18.570
Dominique's really
freaking me out.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.400
OK.
So I found out who the snake is.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.720
- Let's hear it.

33:26.720 --> 33:27.420
Me?

33:32.770 --> 33:35.410
I will wake up this
entire house right now,

33:35.410 --> 33:37.210
put Dominique in
the center and say--

33:37.210 --> 33:38.840
Hey, she wants to
do a full meeting.

33:38.840 --> 33:39.570
Oh my god.

33:39.570 --> 33:40.270
Is she awake?

33:40.270 --> 33:42.010
Oh, yeah.

33:42.010 --> 33:43.780
She wants everyone
here for the party.

33:43.780 --> 33:48.020
I'm going to call my
own party and invite her.

33:48.020 --> 33:48.950
Oh my god.

33:48.950 --> 33:51.220
Are we going to
do this right now?

33:51.220 --> 33:52.400
I'm down to go .

33:52.400 --> 33:53.560
Oh my god.

33:53.560 --> 33:54.740
I have nothing to hide.

33:54.740 --> 33:56.410
It's about to get so crazy.

34:05.730 --> 34:07.860
I got to put on my glasses
dude, I can't miss it.

34:12.640 --> 34:16.470
Oh my god.

34:16.470 --> 34:17.370
Dominique.

34:17.370 --> 34:18.260
Hmm?

34:18.260 --> 34:19.540
Do you want me
to start hissing?

34:19.540 --> 34:21.540
Or do you want me to talk?

34:22.980 --> 34:24.280
You can come upstairs
and find out.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.800
But unless you want
me to start sliding

34:25.800 --> 34:29.890
over there and hissing at you,
we could have a conversation.

34:29.890 --> 34:30.660
Oh, let's do it.

34:33.650 --> 34:35.030
Dominique I'm
honestly a little bit

34:35.030 --> 34:36.310
shocked that you're
talking about me.

34:36.310 --> 34:38.660
You better have the right
ammunition, pointing

34:38.660 --> 34:40.830
the right fingers of me,
because if not, I'm going

34:40.830 --> 34:42.560
to bite those fingers off.

34:42.560 --> 34:46.570
I'm all ears but I don't
think snakes have ears so--

34:46.570 --> 34:47.660
That's cute.

34:47.660 --> 34:49.070
So am I a snake?

34:49.070 --> 34:50.270
Do you think I'm the snake.

34:50.270 --> 34:51.920
I think you have snake
tendencies, yes I do.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.780
- I never said you were a snake.

34:53.780 --> 34:54.980
Do you think I'm
one who's putting

34:54.980 --> 34:56.030
the target on your back.

34:56.030 --> 34:57.380
I don't know.

34:57.380 --> 34:59.560
So maybe don't open
up assumptions when

34:59.560 --> 35:00.590
you don't fully know something.

35:00.590 --> 35:02.850
I can do whatever
I want to do.

35:02.850 --> 35:04.490
- How the hell am a snake.
- Dude, like--

35:04.490 --> 35:04.820
Please tell me.

35:04.820 --> 35:06.590
To be honest with you,
you don't know me like that

35:06.590 --> 35:08.260
to be coming at me first off.
Secondly--

35:08.260 --> 35:09.190
Dude, I was pointed at.

35:09.190 --> 35:10.180
No, no, no, no, no.
OK--

35:10.180 --> 35:10.880
I was pointed at.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.650
I get that and I
didn't point at you.

35:12.650 --> 35:15.170
Dominique, you constantly
drop implications at people

35:15.170 --> 35:16.970
and then you say, Oh, well,
that was your implication.

35:16.970 --> 35:18.530
Oh, by the way,
there is a snake.

35:18.530 --> 35:21.020
Sure there is, but you are
implying that that snake is me.

35:21.020 --> 35:24.340
There is somebody that I
consider to be a tempter.

35:24.340 --> 35:25.040
Why?

35:25.040 --> 35:27.470
Because I'm targeted for
something that I never did.

35:27.470 --> 35:30.340
And this is what disloyalty
looks like for all of you

35:30.340 --> 35:31.310
who are sitting in this room.

35:31.310 --> 35:32.870
And this is what I
wanted to express.

35:32.870 --> 35:35.580
America is going to see
that I was the real one,

35:35.580 --> 35:37.040
that I am the honest one.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.000
You all will see.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.580
So play the game how
ever you feel necessary.

35:40.580 --> 35:42.860
And I'm going to say this
openly, they came for me

35:42.860 --> 35:44.540
and I guarantee
they're coming for you.

35:44.540 --> 35:46.370
I promise unto God and
if you don't believe me

35:46.370 --> 35:47.300
it's totally up to you.

35:47.300 --> 35:49.400
OK you could use the Bible
for whatever you'd like.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.900
But I'm pretty sure God cannot
vouch for you in this moment.

35:51.900 --> 35:52.600
OK, but he will.

35:52.600 --> 35:53.550
So you can swear to
God as much as you can.

35:53.550 --> 35:54.710
- He will you'll see.

35:54.710 --> 35:55.310
Well guess what?

35:55.310 --> 35:56.690
He's not here right
now to play this game.

35:56.690 --> 35:57.380
- Oh, he is.
- But you are.

35:57.380 --> 35:57.790
He's here.

35:57.790 --> 35:58.990
So it's easy to
toss it on to God.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.440
If I'm here, he's here.

36:00.440 --> 36:03.300
Can't you all see
what Paul is doing?

36:03.300 --> 36:07.040
He's a vet, so he's using his
expertise to manipulate you all

36:07.040 --> 36:09.890
and to make it seem as if
he has all of the answers.

36:09.890 --> 36:10.790
You know what?

36:10.790 --> 36:14.750
My answer has come from God
and he'll never lead me astray.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.040
You're going home though.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.060
I guarantee you that.

36:17.060 --> 36:18.690
I know I'm going
home at some point.

36:18.690 --> 36:19.970
I'd be foolish not
to believe that.

36:19.970 --> 36:21.360
Earlier rather than later.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.560
That's real smug coming from
the person who is on the block

36:23.560 --> 36:24.260
right now.

36:38.700 --> 36:39.400
'Sup, stud?

36:39.400 --> 36:41.230
You want me to leave?

36:41.230 --> 36:42.830
You're fine.

36:42.830 --> 36:44.720
I'm sorry I keep
bothering you.

36:44.720 --> 36:47.450
It's good.

36:47.450 --> 36:49.130
I came here for my safety.

36:49.130 --> 36:50.790
Clearly, there's no
saving Dom especially

36:50.790 --> 36:52.380
after the that happened there.

36:57.160 --> 36:58.990
Do you want to leave
nominations the same?

36:58.990 --> 37:01.480
I either want to
put Raven on the block

37:01.480 --> 37:03.960
or leave them the same.

37:03.960 --> 37:09.090
If that happens and we do
not change the nominations,

37:09.090 --> 37:14.310
you will have to vote
for Dominique to go home.

37:14.310 --> 37:16.050
I just want to make sure
that we have the votes

37:16.050 --> 37:17.080
to send Dominique home.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.960
With the numbers
in this house,

37:18.960 --> 37:22.360
I just do not feel safe
going up on the block.

37:22.360 --> 37:25.280
- Yeah.
- I'm not going to screw you.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.990
I hate being in this position.

37:26.990 --> 37:29.620
It's awful because
I know if I go

37:29.620 --> 37:30.780
up on the block I'm going home.

37:34.310 --> 37:36.260
And the only way to
stay safe in this moment

37:36.260 --> 37:38.660
is to convince Jason
and Alex that I'm

37:38.660 --> 37:40.360
voting to evict Dominique.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.810
We're just scared.

37:45.810 --> 37:47.480
We don't want anybody to flip.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.770
I'm telling you right now,
I will vote to evict Dom.

37:58.300 --> 38:00.230
So you do want to
use or you don't?

38:00.230 --> 38:00.930
I don't know.

38:04.150 --> 38:06.610
I want to use it but I
want to put Raven up there.

38:06.610 --> 38:08.000
I feel like that's
the safest bet.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.160
But I can't convince
the HOH to do that.

38:12.160 --> 38:16.820
Alex, if it goes like
it did last time we're--

38:16.820 --> 38:19.910
You don't think Mark's
going to vote with us?

38:19.910 --> 38:21.500
You don't think Mark's
gonna vote with us?

38:26.270 --> 38:28.910
If we leave it the way it
is, Dominique will go home.

38:28.910 --> 38:30.740
I don't know why you are not
getting on board with this

38:30.740 --> 38:32.110
and why you're so
paranoid about this.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.470
Why?
- I just want Dom to go home.

38:34.470 --> 38:35.170
That's it.

38:35.170 --> 38:39.050
When I just make a
decision and go with it,

38:39.050 --> 38:39.950
it always works out.

38:39.950 --> 38:42.500
But when I dance around
a decision like this,

38:42.500 --> 38:47.450
it always blows up in my face
and I'm just sweating it.

38:47.450 --> 38:51.290
The power of this
thing is sneaky.

38:51.290 --> 38:52.330
So what do you want me to do?

39:01.580 --> 39:03.530
Hey everybody, it's time
for the veto meeting.

39:06.720 --> 39:09.310
Look, Dominique you've
been going behind my back

39:09.310 --> 39:12.000
and telling everybody
that I'm a snake.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.850
So I thought why not embrace
it and dress up as a snake.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.150
This is the veto meeting.

39:24.150 --> 39:28.100
Jessica, Dominique, you have
been nominated for eviction.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.600
But I have the power to
veto one of the nominations.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.610
I want to give both
nominees a chance

39:32.610 --> 39:35.910
to tell me why you think I
should use the power of veto

39:35.910 --> 39:36.920
on you.

39:36.920 --> 39:39.270
Jessica.

39:39.270 --> 39:42.180
Jason I picked you to
play in the power of veto

39:42.180 --> 39:45.990
because no one understands how
crappy last week was better

39:45.990 --> 39:47.880
than you.

39:47.880 --> 39:51.660
Despite how crappy all of that
was, I still want to stay here,

39:51.660 --> 39:54.650
so I really hope that you take
me off the block this week.

39:54.650 --> 39:56.040
Thank you, Jessica.

39:56.040 --> 39:58.410
Dominique.

39:58.410 --> 40:00.750
Hello, Jason.

40:00.750 --> 40:05.520
I was framed by my own team.

40:05.520 --> 40:09.000
There is a snake in the
house and I made that known.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.740
And also, I mean he's
dressed appropriately.

40:13.740 --> 40:15.960
And he also has minions
that are working for him.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.550
I will not call
those individuals

40:17.550 --> 40:19.470
out, because I
know that whatever

40:19.470 --> 40:20.980
they sow they shall reap.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.900
If you see fit to take me
off the block, thank you.

40:27.900 --> 40:30.470
But if you don't, I
perfectly understand.

40:30.470 --> 40:31.520
Thank you.

40:31.520 --> 40:34.380
Dominique, do you think
if I use the power of veto

40:34.380 --> 40:38.820
on you, that you
and I would rally?

40:38.820 --> 40:40.320
What do you think
the outcome would be?

40:40.320 --> 40:43.620
Very obvious, that I will not
be willing to work with my team

40:43.620 --> 40:47.550
because they clearly
stabbed me in the back.

40:47.550 --> 40:50.970
If you were to stand
in my shoes and witness

40:50.970 --> 40:53.400
the behavior of
Paul the night prior

40:53.400 --> 40:57.270
and the behavior of Paul
and Elena post-noms,

40:57.270 --> 40:58.830
then you would totally
understand where

40:58.830 --> 41:01.500
I am coming from because
they are not loyal to me

41:01.500 --> 41:03.130
like I was loyal to them.

41:03.130 --> 41:03.840
Thank you.

41:11.390 --> 41:22.290
I have decided not to
use the power of veto.

41:28.770 --> 41:30.220
This meeting is adjourned.

41:43.010 --> 41:44.450
It kind of worked
out perfect even

41:44.450 --> 41:46.190
though everybody wants
to use their power,

41:46.190 --> 41:47.360
I didn't have to this time.

41:47.360 --> 41:50.730
Dominique was just literally
digging her own grave,

41:50.730 --> 41:53.830
so Alex and I can just sit
back, relax, and slap fives,

41:53.830 --> 41:57.410
cause come Thursday night
Dominique is going home.

41:57.410 --> 41:59.390
I'm so relieved that I'm
not on the block this week,

41:59.390 --> 42:04.730
but it's tough to find out
that even if I'm safe this

42:04.730 --> 42:08.300
week Dominique' going
home and I can't trust

42:08.300 --> 42:11.630
anybody in this game.

42:11.630 --> 42:14.340
Look, Dom, if you're
trying to catch a snake, you

42:14.340 --> 42:16.170
better have the confidence
to grab it by the head,

42:16.170 --> 42:17.160
cause guess what?

42:17.160 --> 42:21.480
You tried to grab it by the tail
and I think you just got bit.

42:21.480 --> 42:22.980
Oh Lord, please help me.

42:22.980 --> 42:25.110
You said you're not going
to lead me into temptation.

42:25.110 --> 42:28.260
But if America tempts me and
it happens to save my life?

42:28.260 --> 42:29.460
Am I going to take
the temptation?

42:29.460 --> 42:32.700
Absolutely because I trust
not one person in this house.

42:32.700 --> 42:34.830
ANNOUNCER: Who will be
evicted from the Big Brother

42:34.830 --> 42:37.970
house, Dominique or Jessica?

42:37.970 --> 42:43.050
Plus who will be tempted
inside the Den of Temptation?

42:43.050 --> 42:48.570
Find out, live, Thursday at
9-8 central on "Big Brother."
