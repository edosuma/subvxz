00:26.694 --> 00:29.362
(distant sirens)

00:40.708 --> 00:42.542
Man:
Well, it's not a matter of right and wrong.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.711
It's a matter of righter and wronger.

00:47.423 --> 00:50.842
Man #2:
Righter and wronger?

00:51.009 --> 00:53.845
Those are not words, Carlo.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.555
Carlo:
Hey, that's what the judge said.

00:55.723 --> 00:59.100
The judge said that
in a court of law.

00:59.268 --> 01:01.227
He said righter and wronger,
right there.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.730
"Pledge of Allegiance,"
all that bullshit.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.691
What else did the judge say?

01:08.736 --> 01:11.946
He said that people will,

01:12.114 --> 01:14.741
you know, protect their lives
no matter what.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.034
I mean, he didn't say it like that.
You know, he said it like

01:17.202 --> 01:20.413
the fancy legal shit, but... but yeah.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.540
He said people will protect
their lives no matter what,

01:22.708 --> 01:24.333
something like that.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.920
You heard
about what happened, right?

01:29.173 --> 01:31.090
On the Belt Parkway.
You heard that?

01:31.258 --> 01:34.469
- No.
- Yeah, I was on the Belt Parkway,

01:34.636 --> 01:36.721
- like 65th Street...
- You were on the Belt Parkway?

01:36.889 --> 01:40.475
Yeah, down by the pier.
I'm driving like a bastard

01:40.642 --> 01:44.937
and, you know,
fucking cops pull me over, right?

01:45.105 --> 01:47.815
They give me the breath test.
You know, I'm drunk off my ass,

01:47.983 --> 01:49.901
right, and they lock me up.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.278
So before I go in front of the judge,

01:52.446 --> 01:54.906
my lawyer, he says to me...

01:55.073 --> 01:59.327
he says,
"You know, you were so drunk that...

01:59.495 --> 02:02.079
that it's considered a felony."

02:02.247 --> 02:04.457
- Which means I broke parole.
- Yeah.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.584
That's seven years.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.752
I mean, no lies, Sal...

02:08.920 --> 02:11.464
I... I felt like I was gonna
shit a bowling ball.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.759
So I finally go in front of the judge.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.595
He goes, "Can you please
explain what happened?"

02:17.763 --> 02:19.347
And I said,
"Your Honor, look.

02:19.515 --> 02:23.017
I'm in a bar,
I'm having a drink, right?

02:23.185 --> 02:25.853
These two fucking guys come in,
they assaulted me.

02:26.021 --> 02:28.439
The bashed me, you know,
smashed bottles over my head.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.525
Yeah, there's bottles over my head

02:30.692 --> 02:32.360
and kicked me in the face.

02:32.528 --> 02:35.112
And to save myself,
I got in my car...

02:35.280 --> 02:37.406
you know, I ran out of there,
I got in my car,

02:37.574 --> 02:40.076
- and, you know, I drove off."
- Right. And he bought that?

02:40.244 --> 02:42.745
Yeah, well, he bought nothing.
That's a true story.

02:42.913 --> 02:43.955
- I got no...
- Oh, come on.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.123
Hey, that's a true story.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.667
Okay.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.627
All right.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.796
Okay.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.548
Yeah, I owed all these bookies

02:53.715 --> 02:55.967
and back then I didn't have
nothing to pay them, you know.

02:56.134 --> 02:59.512
So somebody
in the bar called the cops.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.099
But the judge,
he's listening to this

03:03.267 --> 03:05.142
and he's...

03:05.310 --> 03:08.271
you know, he looks like
he's gonna shit a bowling ball.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.857
(laughs)

03:11.024 --> 03:15.027
He says that this is not a simple case
of right and wrong,

03:15.195 --> 03:18.030
but righter and wronger.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.659
Because the defendant had
to break the law...

03:23.745 --> 03:26.163
to protect his own life.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.041
It's un-fucking-believable.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.794
What happened to the cops?

03:31.962 --> 03:34.046
Nothing. They were right
even though they were wrong.

03:34.214 --> 03:38.217
And I was wrong
only because that I was right.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.887
You see? You get that now.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.223
- You get that, right?
- Yeah.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.392
- Righter and wronger.
- Righter and wronger.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.769
That's right.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.315
- You're too much.
- You see what I'm...

03:52.482 --> 03:54.358
(gunshot)

03:54.526 --> 03:56.527
(panting)

04:00.657 --> 04:02.658
(gags)

04:46.244 --> 04:48.245
- (gasps)
- (alarm clock buzzing)

04:59.466 --> 05:01.467
(turns off alarm)

05:35.752 --> 05:37.169
(gun clicks)

05:48.557 --> 06:12.872
(distant siren)

06:18.086 --> 06:20.087
(chattering)

06:21.089 --> 06:23.049
(fire truck honking)

06:26.094 --> 06:28.304
- (tires screech)
- Yo, Tango!

06:28.472 --> 06:30.222
We got that shit on deck!

06:30.390 --> 06:31.807
(tires screech)

06:31.975 --> 06:33.976
- (man shouting)
- (woman crying)

06:36.021 --> 06:38.606
Man: Hey, get your
motherfucking hands off me!

06:40.692 --> 06:42.902
(police radio chatter)

06:43.070 --> 06:45.905
Reporter:
Still very active here at the BK projects.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.741
Details are sketchy,
but here's what we know.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.702
A young African-American man
named Allen Daniels

06:51.870 --> 06:54.038
was allegedly shot
and killed by police.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.373
We're hearing
it was one police officer

06:56.541 --> 06:58.584
who was trying to rob him.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.378
- (crying) He's a good boy.
- It's gonna be okay, all right?

07:01.546 --> 07:03.547
- He's a good boy!
- Reporter: Residents here are

07:03.715 --> 07:07.134
- obviously outraged...
- My boy! My boy!

07:21.942 --> 07:23.609
(alarm chirps)

07:23.777 --> 07:25.194
- Let's just kick it, man.
- Let's go.

07:25.362 --> 07:28.280
Y'all little niggas know
what to do. Hurry up.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.866
It's hot out this motherfucker.
There's police everywhere.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.952
Yo, hurry up.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.080
Yo, it's crazy right now.
What happened?

07:36.248 --> 07:38.582
Tango. Come here, man.
Lemme holla at you real quick.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.293
I thought you was
going back to school, B.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.337
Come on, Tango.
What they gonna teach me

07:43.505 --> 07:45.256
in there I ain't
already learning out here?

07:45.423 --> 07:46.966
But you're gonna make
that court date, right?

07:47.134 --> 07:49.135
Come on, Tango.
You know I'm gonna make the court date.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.636
- You know I'm gonna make the court date.
- All right. Cool.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.222
- What's going on here?
- Yo, these fucking pigs, man.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.100
They done clap a little homey, man.
Shit crazy right now, boy.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.726
- Word?
- Yeah.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.146
- (siren continues)
- (chattering continues)

08:08.822 --> 08:10.489
Check it.
I don't wanna hear

08:10.657 --> 08:13.659
y'all been spending y'all gwap
on these hookers either. You heard?

08:13.827 --> 08:15.995
Wake up in the morning with
your dick looking like a trophy

08:16.163 --> 08:17.830
with the mother.
Ask K Rock.

08:18.874 --> 08:20.583
You know bitches be burning this shit.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.626
Come on, man.
You better stop telling people.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.171
We gonna go in the living room
and fuck with the PlayStation real quick.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.339
Let me see you pop verse two, son.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.675
- What up, Tang.
- What's up, man?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.594
Man:
But yo, truthfully, man,

08:31.761 --> 08:33.679
you know that was
you and your cousin that got shot.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.181
- Man #2: Word up.
- Man: Stretched out.

08:35.347 --> 08:38.726
- Three shots in the chest.
- Police are crazy. Wild.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.895
(sirens blaring)

08:46.902 --> 08:48.903
(woman crying)
Oh God!

09:11.635 --> 09:12.927
Oh God!

09:13.094 --> 09:15.888
Sal:
I did a bad thing...

09:17.098 --> 09:19.058
but to a bad guy.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.644
A very very bad guy, all right?

09:21.811 --> 09:23.520
And for a good reason.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.274
You think that's
a rationalization, right?

09:27.442 --> 09:29.193
That's what you're thinking.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.570
You're here.

09:32.656 --> 09:35.241
So you've prayed for guidance.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.826
No, I couldn't do that.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.662
Priest: Why not?

09:39.829 --> 09:44.208
'Cause prayers were
not gonna give me what I needed.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.587
Is that more important
than your relationship with God?

09:48.755 --> 09:50.965
No matter what you may have done...

09:52.759 --> 09:55.552
- He's ready to forgive you.
- He is, huh?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.596
We're all imperfect creatures...

09:58.890 --> 10:01.058
and we're led to sin.

10:01.226 --> 10:04.228
That's why we have to
surrender our souls to God.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.314
Well, to be honest with you,

10:07.482 --> 10:09.942
I've been here before, all right,

10:10.110 --> 10:12.069
asking for God's help

10:12.237 --> 10:14.530
a lot of times, okay?

10:14.698 --> 10:18.534
And my situation is not getting
any sunnier, you know?

10:18.702 --> 10:22.955
So... so why should it now?

10:23.123 --> 10:26.500
Your pride is denying
the possibility of God's goodness.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.544
Why does He get all the glory?

10:28.712 --> 10:30.629
You know, why is that?

10:30.797 --> 10:34.008
Huh? He gets all the glory
and I get all the blame.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.969
I mean, is it not possible...

10:37.137 --> 10:41.557
(whispers) that maybe God
isn't carrying His end of the weight?

10:42.600 --> 10:45.019
Look. This thing is
obviously weighing on you.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.022
So release it.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.316
Confess your sin.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.942
Pray for forgiveness.

10:52.110 --> 10:55.154
I don't want God's forgiveness.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.949
I want His fucking help.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.663
What? Is that so hard?

11:04.831 --> 11:06.874
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:07.042 --> 11:10.627
Let's just... let's do a few
"Hail Mary"s and go, okay?

11:10.795 --> 11:13.255
Let's... thank you.
Thank you.

11:13.423 --> 11:16.550
This has been really good.
Thank you.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.679
"Hail Mary, full of grace,

11:20.847 --> 11:22.681
the Lord is with thee;
blessed art thou amongst women,

11:22.849 --> 11:24.391
and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.060
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

11:26.227 --> 11:28.812
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death. Amen."

11:30.023 --> 11:31.523
Thank you.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.650
- Sal.
- (footsteps recede)

11:46.873 --> 11:48.916
All right, everybody.
Listen up. Give me your ears.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.835
The BK projects,
you all know it.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.880
18 buildings, 15,000 residents.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.467
The highest crime area
in the highest crime precinct.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.470
Good morning, Sal.
Thanks for joining us.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.764
Larceny, rape, prostitution...

12:03.932 --> 12:05.724
it even takes the crown for kidnapping.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.893
- It's estimated that over...
- Yo.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.853
- What do you hear? What do you say?
- Not too much.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.231
Oh, fuck.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.983
Hey, what do you know about...

12:15.151 --> 12:17.736
what's his name? ...Bobby Powers
with CI? You hear about that?

12:17.904 --> 12:19.154
- Carlo?
- Yeah.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.906
Found him with his face blown off

12:21.074 --> 12:22.741
in a Town Car over by the cemetery.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.911
Oh. They got any leads on that?

12:26.079 --> 12:30.040
Carlo was a grade A asshole.
Everyone's a lead. Why?

12:30.208 --> 12:32.835
No, nothing.
It's just... you know.

12:33.002 --> 12:36.630
And now, the media
shovelling shit on our badges

12:36.798 --> 12:38.298
over the shooting
that took place there.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.552
We have to remind the public
that one man from this unit

12:41.719 --> 12:44.096
cannot stain
the sum total of our efforts;

12:44.264 --> 12:48.100
That we are not in the business
of harming the public but of helping it.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.353
We've been entrusted
with the responsibility to protect

12:51.521 --> 12:54.314
- those who cannot protect themselves.
- (door opens, slams)

12:54.482 --> 12:57.693
This is where
we accomplish that, gentlemen.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.197
Hey, Eddie, what are you doing here?
The bars close early?

13:02.365 --> 13:04.116
I heard you let
another cuffed perp escape.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.742
What's that, about six now?

13:07.412 --> 13:08.412
Is he fucking laughing at you?

13:08.580 --> 13:11.832
- Laughing? Are you laughing at me?
- I'll just slap your fucking mouth.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.209
- Whoa whoa!
- I just wanna talk to him.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.420
- No, just... don't...
- Are you laughing at me, man?

13:16.588 --> 13:19.089
Forget about him. Come on.
Forget about him. Come on.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.300
Fucking burn out, man.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.969
- (snorts)
- Nobody want you here, man.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.679
Let's go.
Hey, you got my fucking "Playboy"?

13:25.847 --> 13:27.723
- That's my "Playboy."
- That's mine.

13:27.891 --> 13:30.767
- You boys starting trouble?
- No, Captain. No, sir.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.270
(phone rings)

13:33.438 --> 13:36.482
Dugan.
See me in my office.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.150
Five minutes.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.036
Eddie:
I forget to fill something out?

13:49.204 --> 13:51.497
Captain: Everything went fine.
Retirement's gone through.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.207
Eddie: Great.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.250
Captain:
How are you doing, Eddie?

13:56.419 --> 13:58.212
(Eddie sighs)

13:58.379 --> 14:00.005
You know.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.382
Captain:
The wife?

14:03.927 --> 14:05.344
Eddie:
You know.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.679
Captain: Here's the deal.
Our commissioner,

14:07.847 --> 14:09.264
he believes in this new program

14:09.432 --> 14:12.184
that puts rookie cops
in the highest crime areas.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.686
So they want
seasoned hairbags like you

14:14.854 --> 14:16.563
breaking these recruits in.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.857
Since you're the oldest here...

14:19.025 --> 14:21.401
Hey, look,
if it's all the same to you,

14:21.569 --> 14:23.237
I've got seven days.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.740
I'm no one's teacher.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.993
I'm not a role model.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.203
God knows you're not, Eddie,

14:31.371 --> 14:33.705
but your name came up
in the computer, pal.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.124
This thing's been kicked up
by two months

14:36.292 --> 14:37.668
and all eyes are on it.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.712
Just do the best you can, okay?

14:42.215 --> 14:44.675
Come on, Dugan.
Don't you want to do something useful

14:44.842 --> 14:46.885
with your last two minutes on the job?

14:50.348 --> 14:51.974
Not really.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.397
(sighs)

15:15.039 --> 15:17.040
(doo-wop music playing)

15:19.002 --> 15:22.713
What the fuck, Clarence?
I've been nursing this seat for 15 minutes.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.257
Don't call me Clarence.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.762
You order for me yet?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.557
Yeah, pancakes, eggs and bacon.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.226
- I told you...
- I know. I remembered turkey bacon.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.103
I know that you don't eat the swine.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.356
All right.
The drugs are in play.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.941
All the principles are accounted for.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.860
I haven't made contact
with the connect yet.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.778
Again with Jersey, huh?

15:46.946 --> 15:49.865
Fuck those racist crackers, man.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.784
You know how they do, Bill.
Black man, black car,

15:52.952 --> 15:55.037
profiling shit.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.456
What am I supposed to do?
Just cave into them?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.250
I played that shit perfectly.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.629
In all fairness there was
20 bricks of raw in the trunk.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.464
Yeah?
Well, they didn't know that.

16:05.632 --> 16:09.134
It's called tact.
You know what tact is, right?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.136
I don't wanna play games
with you, Bill, all right?

16:11.304 --> 16:14.264
Now you need to push harder
about me making grade.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.099
- Talk to the chief.
- I know.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.643
It's not like you haven't earned it.
You've earned it.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.645
But it's just, I've told you,
these things, they take...

16:19.812 --> 16:21.563
Time.
You keep saying that shit,

16:21.731 --> 16:23.482
but you know that
I've put in more than e-fucking-nough.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.442
What's happening?

16:25.610 --> 16:29.446
What's going on? Why is this
all of a sudden so urgent, huh?

16:36.913 --> 16:38.497
When that trooper
pulled us over last night...

16:38.665 --> 16:41.041
- (siren blaring)
...he gets me out of the car

16:41.209 --> 16:43.669
and he's doing
his whole Gestapo bit, right?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.296
My man and thems
in the car are ready.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.881
Shotgun, he's on high alert.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.133
Kid in the back, he's locked,
cocked and ready to rock.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.760
- I ain't going back to jail.
- No, man, hold it. Hold it.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.680
- No no no.
- I'm dying to bust my guns, man.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.306
You know I can't stand
these motherfuckers.

16:56.474 --> 16:59.017
Tango: This guy has no fucking idea
what's about to go down.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.186
- (taps on window)
- Tango: You know what I'm thinking?

17:03.815 --> 17:05.272
"Fuck it."

17:05.441 --> 17:08.026
- (siren blares)
- "Let it be."

17:09.278 --> 17:11.238
And then we get back to the Ps,

17:11.406 --> 17:15.200
and I see the young brother
laid out on the concrete

17:15.367 --> 17:17.035
and I find out how...

17:17.203 --> 17:20.163
Next time you're on my road,

17:20.330 --> 17:22.582
knock the speeding off.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.001
I don't give a damn who you are.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.796
...I start thinking, "We should've just
deaded them motherfuckers on the road.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.631
It'd have been two to one,
but so what?

17:29.799 --> 17:31.383
I'm good with those odds.
Fuck it."

17:33.261 --> 17:35.137
You see what I'm saying?

17:35.304 --> 17:38.223
I'm fucked up in the game, man.
You've got to get me out of here.

17:39.434 --> 17:42.602
I'm gonna keep greasing the wheel
for you, see what we can do, okay?

17:42.770 --> 17:45.230
Desk, suit, tie.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.774
It's just something I need, okay?

17:47.942 --> 17:50.068
I need that shit like water.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.740
Can you look at something for me?

17:59.829 --> 18:02.205
The kid you saw killed in the projects...

18:02.373 --> 18:04.082
it gets worse.
He was an honor student,

18:04.250 --> 18:06.418
a grad student.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.963
The cop who shot him
was trying to rob him.

18:10.131 --> 18:12.758
So of course when
the major newspapers get ahold of this,

18:12.925 --> 18:14.968
the shit's really gonna hit the fan,
if you know what I mean.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.928
Please tell me they caught
the son of a bitch.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.432
Yeah, we caught him,
but the bosses are gonna wanna find

18:20.600 --> 18:22.809
some kind of thing
that's gonna clean this up pronto.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.686
So there's gonna be
some kind of play that goes down.

18:24.854 --> 18:27.147
Some kind of play is gonna happen.
I don't know what it's gonna be,

18:27.315 --> 18:30.442
but I need to know... I need to know
you're my boy out there.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.195
- Oh, I'm your boy, huh?
- You know that's not what I meant.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.035
You get in touch with Allisa?

18:43.706 --> 18:45.457
(sighs)

18:45.625 --> 18:48.794
I... she sent these.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.129
They're divorce papers.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.007
You know, I've got some lawyers'
names in there for you, a list of them.

18:54.175 --> 18:58.136
I've got the department taking care
of everything for you, okay?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.430
(cup clatters)

19:10.149 --> 19:12.317
I want my life back, Bill.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.028
I can see that,
and I'm working on it.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.989
Please. Work harder.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.492
(siren blaring)

19:24.121 --> 19:26.039
The captain says you're retiring.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.335
(radio chatter)

19:37.176 --> 19:39.177
What did you say your name was?

19:39.345 --> 19:42.013
Melvin Panton...
Lance Corporal, US Marines.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.977
Marines.

19:48.020 --> 19:52.357
Well, Lance Corporal Melvin Panton...

19:54.193 --> 19:56.444
seven days from today

19:56.612 --> 19:58.864
is 22 years for me.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.658
Pension doesn't get
any better after that.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.743
Seven days from today?

20:03.911 --> 20:05.453
That's... that's my birthday.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.914
You've been a cop
longer than I've been alive.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.584
Ain't that something?

20:14.672 --> 20:18.717
I can see you're married... the ring.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.385
Separated.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.974
You know, I've always wanted
to be on the force my whole life.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.976
Yeah, it's true.

20:28.144 --> 20:32.063
I had plastic handcuffs
when I was three.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.026
Yeah, every Halloween

20:36.193 --> 20:37.736
I always dressed as a cop.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.280
(distant siren)

20:40.448 --> 20:42.407
I bet you find that
pretty corny, right?

20:42.575 --> 20:46.411
But hey, I'm here now.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.422
(man and woman arguing)

20:58.466 --> 21:00.050
- Wait here.
- Woman: You know what? Fuck you.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.968
Don't touch or do anything.
You got it?

21:07.642 --> 21:10.435
Man: Stop it with the fingers
to the fucking face, all right?

21:10.603 --> 21:13.313
Woman: Oh, yeah? What are
you gonna do? What are you gonna do?

21:13.481 --> 21:16.566
Man: I'm gonna cut 'em right off.
Stop it with the fucking fingers.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.443
- Every fucking...
- You'd better back down.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.111
- Every fucking time you do that.
- You'd better fucking back down.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.696
Get out of my face.
Get out of my face.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.365
- Ah!
- All right, how about that?

21:23.532 --> 21:25.784
- You're always talking to these guys.
- Woman: I ain't doing nothing.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.494
- Man: Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not doing... I was shopping!

21:27.662 --> 21:30.246
You know what? You're fucking pissing...
don't you fucking start with me.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.998
- Man: Get your finger out of my face.
- Don't start with me!

21:32.166 --> 21:35.043
- All right? Get your finger...
- Hey! Hey hey hey hey, enough!

21:35.211 --> 21:36.836
- Take a step back.
- Get the fuck outta here.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.797
- I'm gonna ask you one more time...
- Who the fuck are you?

21:38.965 --> 21:41.633
- All right, that's it. You're under arrest.
- That's good. That's okay.

21:41.801 --> 21:45.470
Walk... walk... walk away. Walk away.
Walk away. What did I tell you?

21:45.638 --> 21:47.847
- I said don't do anything, just sit there.
- He just hit her, man.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.600
Hey, this is 64th Precinct.

21:50.768 --> 21:52.352
We are what?
What are we?

21:52.520 --> 21:53.812
- 65.
- 65th, right.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.439
Was it Halloween that day
at the academy?

21:56.607 --> 21:58.149
What the fuck is wrong with you?

21:58.317 --> 22:00.944
You do not make
an arrest out of zone.

22:01.112 --> 22:02.696
Get in the car.
Get in the car.

22:02.863 --> 22:05.323
- Eddie. Eddie, it is...
- We'll talk about it in the car.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.492
- You...
- Get in the car.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.705
- (door closes)
- Uh-huh.

22:11.872 --> 22:15.417
Happy days are here again.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.585
(coins jingle)

22:19.714 --> 22:22.173
(phone ringing)

22:24.677 --> 22:27.429
You've reached Allisa.
I can't come to the phone right...

22:27.596 --> 22:29.597
(coins clink)

22:33.561 --> 22:35.854
Hey! Yo.

22:36.022 --> 22:39.357
- Hey, calm down.
- Get the fuck away from my car.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.153
Get a real fucking job, man.

22:48.075 --> 22:51.036
- (engine starts)
- (tires screech)

22:53.789 --> 22:56.124
Well, what if you turn on
the news tonight and she's dead?

22:56.292 --> 22:59.044
- Hmm?
- I don't watch the news.

22:59.211 --> 23:02.255
- It's depressing.
- You just...

23:04.508 --> 23:06.968
You're just gonna act
like this never happened?

23:10.973 --> 23:12.724
This is your first day, kid.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.185
Today a woman gets hit.
Tomorrow it's a rape.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.187
The day after that it's a murder.

23:17.354 --> 23:19.397
- Dad! Dad!
- What's up, Dad?

23:19.565 --> 23:21.983
Eddie:
You've got 20 years of days.

23:22.151 --> 23:25.570
This job takes enough out of you.
Don't take it home.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.748
In my book, that's called a coward.

23:36.916 --> 23:41.086
Yeah, well,
I'm not much of a reader either.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.095
- I'll eat in the car.
- Yeah, good.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.263
Good idea.

24:01.732 --> 24:04.526
Seven days, Eddie.
Seven days.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.493
- You're the one that always...
- Shut up.

24:13.661 --> 24:15.495
- You're asking him.
- You ask him.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.997
You ask him.
You do it. Okay.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.457
- Hey, Dad.
- Dad. Hey, Dad, Dad, Dad.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.292
- Dad, turtle turtle...
- What did I tell you?

24:21.460 --> 24:24.879
- What did I tell him about the turtle?
- You can't get a turtle until you get a room.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.923
That's right. So now you go to
the pet store

24:27.091 --> 24:29.467
and pick out two turtles, 'cause you boys
are gonna have your own room.

24:29.635 --> 24:30.927
- Boys: Really?!
- Sal: Yes.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.638
- Boy: Yeah!
- (boys cheer)

24:33.806 --> 24:35.932
- Sal: Dad here looking for a princess.
- (door closes)

24:36.100 --> 24:38.518
There she is.
There she is.

24:38.686 --> 24:40.478
What are you doing, huh?
What are you doing?

24:40.646 --> 24:43.523
- Look what I made.
- Oh, yeah? What is it? Is that me?

24:43.691 --> 24:45.150
- Yeah.
- Is my head that big?

24:45.317 --> 24:46.943
- Yeah.
- You better say no. You better say no.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.778
Where's your mother, huh?
Where is she?

24:48.946 --> 24:50.280
- No, where is she in real life?
- Angela: Sal.

24:50.447 --> 24:53.825
- Go get her.
- Mom! Dad's home!

24:56.787 --> 24:58.788
(kids chattering)

25:17.516 --> 25:19.225
This is not enough, man.
What's this...

25:19.393 --> 25:21.853
this is not enough.
This is not enough.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.355
- This is... fuck!
- Angela: Watch your language!

25:24.523 --> 25:26.733
What are you doing down there?
Come on, we're waiting for you.

25:26.901 --> 25:28.568
No, I... fuck.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.542
Sal, what are you doing?

25:54.553 --> 25:56.221
Sal.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.098
- (glass shatters)
- Boy: Mom!

25:59.266 --> 26:01.434
- What?
- Vicky dropped a glass.

26:01.602 --> 26:03.269
- Coming.
- Vicky: I didn't do it, Vinny did.

26:03.437 --> 26:06.439
Angela: Come on, Sal.
Don't touch the glass.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.608
(kids arguing)

26:15.324 --> 26:17.200
(sighs)

26:19.828 --> 26:21.829
(chattering)

26:28.712 --> 26:30.713
(hip-hop music playing)

26:32.633 --> 26:34.634
(woman giggles)

26:36.095 --> 26:37.637
Hello.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.979
Hi, Tango.
(giggles)

26:46.146 --> 26:49.274
Yeah, bro.
Look at what's behind you.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.242
Better watch where
you're fucking walking, man.

26:59.410 --> 27:01.494
- Who the fuck is you talking to?
- I'm talking to you, motherfucker.

27:01.662 --> 27:02.912
Just watch where
the fuck you're walking.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.456
Nlgga, you'd better watch

27:09.628 --> 27:10.962
"Watch your mouth"?
You'd better watch your grill.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.880
Guard your grill, motherfucker.
You might get it slapped.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.826

27:41.994 --> 27:43.703

27:46.165 --> 27:48.916
True true true.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.461
Yeah, but you wouldn't have
air in your lungs if it wasn't for me.

27:51.628 --> 27:54.172

28:45.391 --> 28:47.475

28:51.563 --> 28:53.856
That's right.

28:54.024 --> 28:56.692
I'll be festive for you, baby.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.237
- Appreciate it.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.072
Yo yo, hold it down.
Keep it tight.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.076
Eight years.

29:19.383 --> 29:20.842
No, you look good,

29:21.009 --> 29:23.177
- Got this watch and shit.
- Oh, that shit is it, yeah.

29:23.345 --> 29:24.887
How do you work that?
I don't even know how to work all this.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.056
I just put the bling on.
You know I'm a knock.

29:27.224 --> 29:30.518

29:30.686 --> 29:33.563
Oh, man.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.815
Mmm.

29:35.983 --> 29:38.276
(sighs)

29:38.444 --> 29:40.278
I talked to Rodrigo about you, man.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.947
- Word?

29:43.115 --> 29:45.783
Why don't you link up?

Yeah. Well, let me holla

29:49.204 --> 29:50.496
But he told me, though.

29:50.664 --> 29:54.292
He said y'all motherfuckers

29:54.460 --> 29:57.336
Oh, yeah, B.
Bringing that shit in 90% pure.

29:57.504 --> 30:00.047
- (exhales deeply)
- Step on that shit like Gregory Hines, man.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.675
It's still gonna outlast everybody's.

30:02.843 --> 30:04.177
They have to change
the bus routes, man,

30:04.344 --> 30:06.804
so many smokers flying over here
trying to get this product.

30:06.972 --> 30:09.140
This a monster right now.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.643
We clearing like 50 thou' a day.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.979
Oh. 50. 50?

30:15.147 --> 30:17.315
On a bad day.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.484
Ooh.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.403
My man Tango.

30:22.571 --> 30:24.030
(chuckles)

30:24.198 --> 30:26.491
You always were smarter
than the average motherfucker.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.826
(chuckles)

30:36.335 --> 30:37.877
But on the strength, though,

30:38.045 --> 30:41.005
I just wanna say thank you, man.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.509
The lawyer you turned me onto...

30:44.676 --> 30:46.594
shit, I don't know
what that motherfucker did,

30:46.762 --> 30:48.763
but whatever it was...

30:49.848 --> 30:51.641
I wouldn't have won
that appeal if it wasn't for him.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.685
- Oh, man, that was nothing.
- Nothing?

30:55.771 --> 30:57.563
Bullshit.

30:57.731 --> 31:00.816
Yo, man, I've been running

31:06.198 --> 31:09.116

came to see me, man.

31:09.284 --> 31:12.703
Not a card, not a visit,
not a magazine.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.830
Nothing.

31:17.626 --> 31:18.876
You different though, man.

31:19.044 --> 31:22.880
Motherfuckers don't understand
what it's like being incarcerated.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.007
You know
you fresh out of the bing

31:25.175 --> 31:27.093
when you use words
like "incarcerated."

31:27.261 --> 31:29.136
(both chuckle)

31:29.304 --> 31:31.889
I'm edumacated now, man.

31:37.187 --> 31:39.438

31:39.606 --> 31:42.900
It's just good to know we got

31:44.027 --> 31:46.028

31:47.239 --> 31:49.323
Yeah yeah yeah.

- Yes, good to see you back, baby.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.036
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, Mom.

31:54.204 --> 31:56.581
No video games.
Keep it down. Keep it down.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.416
No video games.

31:58.584 --> 31:59.750
Vinny:
Fine, okay.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.752
- Hey, baby.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.921

32:04.089 --> 32:06.841
- She said, "Where's the deposit?"
- "Where's the deposit?"

32:07.009 --> 32:08.676
- "I need the deposit. Where is it?"
- (both laugh)

32:08.844 --> 32:10.761
No, I'll call her tomorrow.

32:10.929 --> 32:14.473
I thought... I thought... I thought
that wasn't gonna work out.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.517
What? No.
No, there was a problem,

32:16.685 --> 32:19.520
but every problem's
an opportunity, right?

32:21.189 --> 32:24.609
Yeah. I just don't want you to build it up
too much for the kids, you know?

32:24.776 --> 32:27.361
Oh shit, though. Did you see?
Oh, you should've...

32:27.529 --> 32:29.030
Vinny and Vito when I told them

32:35.454 --> 32:37.663
No, we haven't.
We haven't been down this road.

32:37.831 --> 32:39.582
Yeah, get their hopes up...

32:39.750 --> 32:42.126
- Don't...

32:42.294 --> 32:45.296
You don't mean to be negative,

- I absolutely promise you.
- I just think you should keep it...

32:53.180 --> 32:54.847

- No.

32:55.015 --> 32:57.016
- No, this is not like before.
- Yeah, I do.

32:57.184 --> 32:58.434
It is not like... come on, look at this.

32:58.602 --> 33:01.145
This is our house.
We belong here.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.731
Look at this.
Right here you have a little pool

33:03.899 --> 33:05.733

33:05.901 --> 33:07.902
All right, over here you have
a little garden for Vicky.

33:08.070 --> 33:10.738
And in here is the kitchen.
You've seen the kitchen, right?

33:10.906 --> 33:13.115
- Yeah.
- Oh, this kitchen's gonna knock you out.

33:13.283 --> 33:14.992

I'm gonna believe you, okay?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.001
(coughing)

33:25.087 --> 33:27.088

33:33.011 --> 33:34.720
He goes on and on. It's just...

33:34.888 --> 33:37.973
Yeah, well, you're still not

33:38.141 --> 33:40.851

- Why?

33:41.937 --> 33:44.772
'Cause I got dizzy... twice.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.358
Oh, fuck. You're getting dizzy spells?
You're getting dizzy spells

33:47.526 --> 33:48.693

33:48.860 --> 33:51.237
Angie, you cannot do that.
You've gotta tell me.

33:51.405 --> 33:54.699
Okay? 'Cause it's the fucking mold
in these walls.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.867
That's what it is.
You know it is.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.994
It gets to your asthma.
It goes into your lungs.

33:59.162 --> 34:01.038
No no no, baby.
No no no.

You need a new house.

34:03.667 --> 34:06.377
Sal, I don't need anything.
I really don't.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.254
Just you, babe.

34:08.422 --> 34:10.380

Check this out, bitch.
You'd better pull your shit together quick.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.190
- Ah.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.794
#One pill makes you larger #

36:53.962 --> 36:58.549
#And one pill makes you small #

36:58.717 --> 37:03.012
#And the ones

37:03.179 --> 37:06.056
#Don't do anything at all... #

37:06.224 --> 37:08.851
- Hey, Papi, can I ask you a question?
- (thunder rumbling)

37:09.019 --> 37:11.228
(rain pattering)

37:13.064 --> 37:15.774
Why you ain't got
no bullets in your gun?

37:22.407 --> 37:23.991
Can I ask you something?

37:25.952 --> 37:29.371
What do you see

#Has given you the call #

#Call Alice... #

37:39.257 --> 37:41.258
Yeah.

You gonna speak up?

37:52.062 --> 37:53.604
(clicks tongue)

37:53.772 --> 37:56.941
Or do I have to suck it out of you?

37:57.108 --> 37:59.818
Hmm? Come here.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.780
Sit back.

38:02.948 --> 38:06.784
#Go ask Alice #

38:06.952 --> 38:11.080
#I think she'll know... #

38:15.126 --> 38:16.961
Talk to me, Papi.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.546
Mmm. Easy.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.299
Easy easy easy easy easy.

38:23.677 --> 38:25.386
(sighs)

38:25.553 --> 38:27.721
Slow slow slow slow slow slow.

38:30.433 --> 38:33.227
This kid... fucking kid...

38:33.395 --> 38:35.980
easy easy easy.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.565
- Just your tongue.
- (moans)

38:38.733 --> 38:41.193
This fucking kid... this rookie prick,

38:41.361 --> 38:44.321
that bullshit look in his eyes,

38:44.489 --> 38:46.907
like Lancelot or something.

38:47.075 --> 38:48.951
He's gonna fix everything,
fucking kid.

38:49.119 --> 38:51.495
(sighs)

38:51.663 --> 38:53.914
Like this is his only reason
for getting up in the morning.

38:54.082 --> 38:55.833
Yes, right there.
Right there. Right there.

38:59.254 --> 39:00.546
He doesn't know...

39:00.714 --> 39:03.132
he don't know a mean
fucking universe out there.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.009
Fuck yeah.

39:08.888 --> 39:12.599
Children:
Now I lay me down to sleep.

39:12.767 --> 39:17.021
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

39:17.188 --> 39:21.483
If I should die before I wake,

39:21.651 --> 39:25.654
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

39:25.822 --> 39:27.448
Amen.

39:27.615 --> 39:29.825
What do you do now?

39:31.828 --> 39:34.079
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, you two.

39:34.247 --> 39:35.956
I love you.

39:36.124 --> 39:37.916
Love you too.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.559
(distant siren)

40:01.524 --> 40:03.734
(hip-hop music playing)

40:06.988 --> 40:08.197
Yo, everything safee.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.240
All right, hold it down.

40:10.408 --> 40:13.118
Yo, J-Mill start wrapping them shits
like they're Christmas presents.

40:13.286 --> 40:14.536
Get them things flying.

40:14.704 --> 40:16.872
- Don't rush perfection.
- Word up, man.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.124
- Yo, Jeb!
- Yo.

40:21.377 --> 40:24.254
- Yo, Jeb, man.
- Whoo!

40:24.422 --> 40:26.590
- Yo, that's a 50 right there.
- I can work with that.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.759
- Yo, Wiz.
- Yo.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.098
Yo, it sunny out there or what?

40:34.265 --> 40:36.850
- Hey, what you need to do is...
- (all shouting)

40:37.018 --> 40:39.603
Get the fuck out of here.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.480
I mean it...
you gangster, boy.

40:41.648 --> 40:44.233
Come on, Jeb.
Just bring back that bread.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.698
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

40:51.866 --> 40:53.408
My niggas are fresh, man.

40:53.576 --> 40:54.952
Fuck this shit, man.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.912
I hate this stupid ass bullshit.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.831
- Bitch ass nigga.
- That's bullshit.

40:58.998 --> 41:00.332
Hold up, man.
Let me make sure.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.626
It's cool outside, man.
I'm stepping out to the store.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.711
All right. All right.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.967
Niggas always talking shit.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.803
Yo, man, get this goddamn
refrigerator out of here, man.

41:12.971 --> 41:16.473
Hey, you're gonna take me right back
to where you came from

41:16.641 --> 41:18.225
or I'm gonna blow your
motherfucking brain out.

41:18.393 --> 41:19.852
You got that, Coolio?
You got it?

41:20.019 --> 41:23.063
You gonna say a fucking word?
No. Yeah, that's right.

41:36.452 --> 41:37.828
All right, go go go.

41:37.996 --> 41:41.165
Flinch and I will blow out
the back of your fucking spine.

41:41.332 --> 41:44.168
- Now open the door, bitch.
- You're gonna get me killed, man.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.839
- Go!
- Police!

41:49.007 --> 41:50.132
- (gunshots)
- Oh shit!

41:50.300 --> 41:53.177
- Get down on the ground!
- (gunshots)

41:53.344 --> 41:55.512
- Go!
- Don't move, police!

41:55.680 --> 41:57.681
Don't fucking move.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.641
Oh shit.
Oh shit.

41:59.809 --> 42:01.727
Check the bathroom.
Check the bathroom.

42:01.895 --> 42:03.896
Get inside there.
Make sure it's all clear.

42:07.692 --> 42:11.111
Come on, get down.
Don't fucking move.

42:11.279 --> 42:13.322
Here we go.
Police! Police!

42:13.489 --> 42:15.490
Open the door.

42:15.658 --> 42:17.868
- Open the door.
- (woman screaming)

42:18.036 --> 42:19.995
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

42:20.163 --> 42:22.414
Come on, I got this, man.
Take this, take this.

42:22.582 --> 42:24.833
- (woman screaming)
- Bitch, shut the fuck up, yo.

42:25.001 --> 42:28.170
Yo, come on.
Hurry up.

42:29.631 --> 42:32.174
- Go go go!
- Hands where I can see 'em.

42:32.342 --> 42:34.885
What the fuck are you doing
by the window? What the fuck?

42:35.053 --> 42:36.553
Where's the money?
Are you hiding money?

42:36.721 --> 42:38.889
Did you throw it out the window?
You're fucking lying to me.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.641
- Are you lying to me?
- No, I'm not.

42:40.808 --> 42:43.227
- Where is the fucking money?
- Ain't no money.

42:43.394 --> 42:46.188
Somebody out there? Huh?
Who's that? Who's that?

42:46.356 --> 42:48.899
Hey! Get the fuck down.
Get the fuck down.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.068
Do not even fucking
look at me, asshole.

42:51.236 --> 42:53.946
- The money's left the building.
- Sal, what are you doing, man?

42:54.113 --> 42:57.074
- Shut your fucking mouth.
- The money's left the building.

43:03.122 --> 43:05.707
(panting)

43:05.875 --> 43:08.001
(horns honking)

43:10.255 --> 43:12.089
(train rattling)

43:12.257 --> 43:14.675
Stop!

43:20.848 --> 43:22.391
- Hey!
- Aah!

43:23.393 --> 43:24.393
Get off me!

43:24.560 --> 43:26.436
(grunts)

43:26.604 --> 43:28.897
- Do not fucking move.
- Get off me.

43:29.065 --> 43:31.775
You hear me?
Do not fucking move.

43:35.947 --> 43:38.782
Suspect got away.
Suspect got away.

43:38.950 --> 43:40.534
- Please.
- Where's the money? Huh?

43:40.702 --> 43:43.036
Where's the money?

43:43.204 --> 43:46.164
What the fuck are you talking about?
I ain't got no money.

43:50.420 --> 43:52.296
Don't got any money?

43:52.463 --> 43:55.173
What are you running for
if you don't have any money?

43:55.341 --> 43:56.925
I could have shot you
in the fucking back.

43:57.093 --> 43:59.636
Get out of here. Get your shit and get
out of here before you get me in trouble.

43:59.804 --> 44:03.265
What the fuck? Diapers?
What the fuck?

44:03.433 --> 44:05.434
- Fuck! Holy shit!
- Shit.

44:08.229 --> 44:09.980
Oh fuck.

44:37.383 --> 44:39.593
- Hey, what's up?
- How you doing?

44:41.554 --> 44:44.306
- That the botulism special?
- Hey, vamos, Tango.

44:51.481 --> 44:54.024
Who's that at the table with Bill?

44:54.192 --> 44:56.485
I don't even know, man.

45:05.370 --> 45:08.747
Clarence... I mean Tango.
I'd like you to mean Special Agent...

45:08.915 --> 45:11.333
Smith. Sit down, chief.

45:11.501 --> 45:14.044
Smith comes in on all our big cases.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.881
You've done some
very impressive work.

45:18.049 --> 45:19.716
Got me promoted.

45:19.884 --> 45:22.677
I thank you.

45:23.763 --> 45:26.765
And my realtor really thanks you.

45:28.059 --> 45:30.060
You want to tell me what I'm doing here?

45:30.228 --> 45:32.813
You know,
when Washington got wind

45:32.980 --> 45:36.316
of this dirty cop
shooting that grad student,

45:36.484 --> 45:38.276
we had to step in.

45:38.444 --> 45:41.071
A thing like that,
it messes people up.

45:41.239 --> 45:43.907
They forget what side they're on.

45:44.075 --> 45:46.660
They forget who the real enemy is.

45:46.828 --> 45:50.122
Every now and then we've got
to come in and remind 'em.

45:53.626 --> 45:55.585
Casanova Phillips.

45:58.214 --> 46:01.591
Judge gave this scumbag
a get out of jail free card.

46:01.759 --> 46:04.594
We want you to take that card away,

46:04.762 --> 46:06.930
but we need evidence.

46:07.098 --> 46:11.226
You put him on a deal
with our UCs and push it through.

46:11.394 --> 46:13.770
Provide a location narco can hit.

46:13.938 --> 46:17.899
Raid supplies the evidence
and I get myself a high profile arrest.

46:18.067 --> 46:20.902
Yeah, well...

46:22.530 --> 46:24.614
I respectfully decline your offer.

46:26.075 --> 46:29.494
What the fuck is this?
You fucking kidding me?

46:33.374 --> 46:35.917
How's Allisa your wife?

46:36.085 --> 46:38.753
Oh, I'm sorry, that's soon
to be ex-wife, right?

46:38.921 --> 46:40.922
Get out. Get out.

46:41.090 --> 46:43.675
It's all right. Thank you.
Just give us a minute, please.

46:43.843 --> 46:46.052
I heard she's remodeling your house.

46:46.220 --> 46:49.055
On a cop's salary, huh?

46:50.641 --> 46:52.267
You know, a whole lot of cash

46:52.435 --> 46:54.978
has passed through your hands
over the last two years.

46:55.146 --> 46:56.813
I ain't stole so much as a nickel

46:56.981 --> 46:58.940
since I've been on the job.
You ain't got shit.

46:59.108 --> 47:01.818
Oh, you do not want me to put
a microscope up your ass,

47:01.986 --> 47:04.321
'cause if I do, I will keep looking
until I find something.

47:04.489 --> 47:07.115
- Or you plant something?
- Watch that.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.661
Now you listen to me.

47:11.829 --> 47:14.831
You think you're a tough guy

47:14.999 --> 47:18.043
'cause you did undercover
at Clinton Correctional?

47:18.211 --> 47:20.504
You even survived a little incident.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.631
If you know so much about me,

47:22.798 --> 47:25.967
then maybe you should
stop fucking with me.

47:26.135 --> 47:28.178
If you got a case, bring it.

47:28.346 --> 47:32.891
But until that time, step off, dude.

47:35.853 --> 47:38.396
Hey! Hey!
Wait.

47:38.564 --> 47:40.190
Was this shit
supposed to be serious?

47:40.358 --> 47:42.567
You expect me to stand there and listen?
Get the fuck out of here.

47:42.735 --> 47:44.653
Don't let her get to you.

47:44.820 --> 47:46.404
Don't let her get to you, okay?

47:46.572 --> 47:48.823
She's about to become the head
of the New York division too.

47:48.991 --> 47:50.367
- Can you believe that?
- What'd you get out of this, Bill?

47:50.535 --> 47:52.035
- What'd I get out of it?
- Yeah, you got an upgrade?

47:52.203 --> 47:53.870
You gonna be sergeant?
Captain? What?

47:54.038 --> 47:55.539
Take it easy.
I'm on your side.

47:55.706 --> 47:57.541
Now I understand you got
a history with this Phillips.

47:57.708 --> 48:00.043
He saved my fucking life, man.

48:01.546 --> 48:03.213
Hey, know why I'm here?

48:03.381 --> 48:05.590
You do this,
you've got detective first grade.

48:08.886 --> 48:11.888
It's real this time. Huh?

48:12.056 --> 48:14.891
Approved yesterday.

48:15.059 --> 48:18.728
Office of your choice.
Shift of your choice.

48:18.896 --> 48:22.232
All you got to do is just get
through this one lousy thing.

48:22.400 --> 48:26.069
You know, it's always
one more thing with you, Bill.

48:26.237 --> 48:28.947
Hey, don't throw this away.

48:29.115 --> 48:31.908
- Hey, Tango.
- (engine starts)

48:32.076 --> 48:33.743
Don't throw this away.
This is your life.

48:44.714 --> 48:46.631
Sal: All right, let's up the ante.
Five buck ante.

48:46.799 --> 48:48.925
Let's do it.
Let's play like men.

48:49.093 --> 48:51.011
- Put your five bucks in.
- I already anted.

48:51.178 --> 48:54.306
So you guys hear
the latest

48:54.473 --> 48:56.641
on Bobby Powers?

48:56.809 --> 48:59.144
I'm gonna slap you.
Come on.

48:59.312 --> 49:02.272
Word is he was in on this
insurance scam with the mob.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.566
He is so fucked.
Wait a minute.

49:04.734 --> 49:07.611
If his old lady moves out on him
because of this, I call first dibs.

49:07.778 --> 49:10.280
Come on, no wives,
no girlfriends, man.

49:10.448 --> 49:13.575
So one of these wiseguys gets pinched
for some drug thing in Jersey

49:13.743 --> 49:17.162
and to save his own ass he rats
on Bobby for guess what?

49:17.330 --> 49:20.790
- Robbing dealers in Brooklyn.
- Prick.

49:20.958 --> 49:23.877
I'll never get that. If you're gonna do
something wrong there's a risk.

49:24.045 --> 49:26.421
If you can't handle the risk,
you shouldn't do it in the first place.

49:26.589 --> 49:28.965
Yeah, one bad cop
makes us all look bad.

49:29.133 --> 49:30.675
Ronny, are you retarded?

49:30.843 --> 49:32.302
I'm talking about the mob guy
who ratted him out.

49:32.470 --> 49:33.511
Boy Scouts of America over here.

49:33.679 --> 49:35.805
Girl Scout. Yo, throw me
a couple cookies, huh?

49:35.973 --> 49:38.391
Come on, Ronny. These wiseguys,
they break the law to become wiseguys.

49:38.559 --> 49:41.686
And then soon as shit goes bad
they break their bullshit mafia codes

49:41.854 --> 49:44.606
to get witness protection under the same
laws they were breaking in the first place.

49:44.774 --> 49:47.067
Wait wait wait wait.
I wasn't talking about the fucking mafia.

49:47.234 --> 49:49.319
I was talking about us.
Cops.

49:49.487 --> 49:51.321
I don't know about you, Pat,

49:51.489 --> 49:54.491
but I think we're too good
to take drug money, right?

49:54.659 --> 49:56.910
I say get off your high horse.
There's no civilians in the room.

49:57.078 --> 49:59.454
- You gonna call?
- I'm in, baby.

49:59.622 --> 50:01.831
- Okay.
- Read 'em and weep.

50:01.999 --> 50:04.042
- You too, Brutus?
- Read 'em and weep.

50:04.210 --> 50:07.045
Cheddar coming, kid.
That's it, baby.

50:07.213 --> 50:10.465
Give me that money, kid.
I love the smell.

50:11.550 --> 50:13.802
Would you do it? Tell 'em.
Sal, come on.

50:13.969 --> 50:15.804
We all know where that money goes.

50:15.971 --> 50:17.555
Better still, we know
where it doesn't go.

50:17.723 --> 50:20.684
It's not going to rehab clinics.
That money is not going to junkies

50:20.851 --> 50:23.061
to help with their families.
It sure as shit is not going to us,

50:23.229 --> 50:25.105
'cause I haven't had a raise
in four years, all right?

50:25.272 --> 50:27.816
They got millions
of dollars sitting in an office

50:27.983 --> 50:30.151
waiting to get shoveled
to the city's excess fund,

50:30.319 --> 50:31.653
and you know what that is.

50:31.821 --> 50:35.365
It's city big shots decorating
their offices with mahogany desks

50:35.533 --> 50:38.243
and Persian rugs, right?
All with drug money.

50:38.411 --> 50:40.161
We risk life and limb

50:40.329 --> 50:43.248
taking and giving money
to scumbags who don't deserve it.

50:43.416 --> 50:45.625
So far be it for me to wag my finger

50:45.793 --> 50:47.502
at somebody
who's looking out for himself.

50:47.670 --> 50:50.213
You guys want to take
the soapbox away here?

50:50.381 --> 50:52.048
You brought a tear
to my eye right there.

50:52.216 --> 50:54.342
Hey, fuck you guys.

50:54.510 --> 50:55.802
Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

50:55.970 --> 50:58.722
I'm on your side.
The city's got no respect for cops.

50:58.889 --> 51:00.557
I mean, what's the starting pay?

51:00.725 --> 51:02.225
$20,000.

51:02.393 --> 51:04.436
All right, 20 fucking grand.
Come on.

51:04.603 --> 51:06.104
Who's gonna raise a family on that?

51:06.272 --> 51:08.940
All right, that's it.
That's the worst part of it.

51:09.108 --> 51:12.861
All right, the $100,000 they pay your family
if you get killed in the line of duty.

51:13.028 --> 51:14.237
Fat lot of good that does anybody.

51:14.405 --> 51:16.072
You're worth more to them
dead than alive, man

51:16.240 --> 51:17.574
100K.
You know what?

51:17.742 --> 51:20.243
Shoot me in the fucking face.
My girl needs a new car.

51:20.411 --> 51:22.579
Hey, don't you touch that gun.

51:22.747 --> 51:25.623
Again, the point that you've got to be
a fatality to provide for your kids...

51:25.791 --> 51:28.001
- Daddy.
- Shit, I told you don't come down here.

51:28.169 --> 51:30.462
Shit.
Nobody touch the cards or the...

51:30.629 --> 51:33.715
shit, I told you
not to come down here, all right?

51:33.883 --> 51:36.092
Nobody touch the money.
Nobody touch the cards.

51:36.260 --> 51:38.428
What are you doing down here?
What, Vinny? Vinny, what?

51:38.596 --> 51:40.972
Daddy, Vinny keeps coming in my room.
We're trying to get dressed.

51:41.140 --> 51:42.807
What is that skirt?
What are you doing?

51:42.975 --> 51:44.434
Um, what is this smoke?

51:44.602 --> 51:46.352
- All right, see what I told you?
- Touché.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.772
All right, don't worry about the smoke.
Don't tell your mother.

51:48.939 --> 51:51.024
Here, you and Myeisha take this.

51:51.192 --> 51:52.776
Go out and have
a good time, all right?

51:52.943 --> 51:54.444
I love you.
Give me a kiss.

51:54.612 --> 51:56.279
- Bye, Myeisha.
- Good bye.

51:56.447 --> 51:58.823
- Bye, have fun.
- Change that skirt.

51:58.991 --> 52:00.992
People will start to think
we're Catholic only on Sundays.

52:01.160 --> 52:03.870
Yo yo, Sally Sal, I didn't realize
you were living in Harlem.

52:04.038 --> 52:05.413
- (beatboxing)
- Watch your mouth.

52:05.581 --> 52:07.290
Don't fuck around, Patrick.

52:07.458 --> 52:09.876
We don't talk like that in this house.
Not in front of my kid.

52:10.044 --> 52:12.128
I dig it over here
on Malcolm X Boulevard.

52:12.296 --> 52:14.964
- Oh no, you didn't.
- Yes, I did, my nigga.

52:15.132 --> 52:17.300
- See you later, Dad.
- Ronny: Hey, Pat.

52:17.468 --> 52:19.052
You want me to come over there
and kick your ass?

52:19.220 --> 52:20.637
- Is that what you want?
- Ooh.

52:20.805 --> 52:23.306
- You know my wife is black.
- Of course I know your wife is black.

52:23.474 --> 52:26.142
My shorty is black. Don't we go
shopping for cocoa butter together?

52:26.310 --> 52:27.685
Now that's it!

52:29.730 --> 52:32.482
- You racist prick!
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

52:32.650 --> 52:34.818
What the fuck, Sal?

52:34.985 --> 52:38.321
Fuck you, I'm a fucking racist.
I would take a bullet for you, Sal.

52:38.489 --> 52:41.491
Not in front of my kids.
I listen to your shit all day long.

52:41.659 --> 52:43.785
Come on, George, get off of me.

52:43.953 --> 52:45.370
What the fuck, Sal?

52:45.538 --> 52:47.080
Take it outside.
Take it outside.

52:47.248 --> 52:48.706
- You're dead, man.
- Just take him upstairs.

52:48.874 --> 52:51.751
Take him upstairs for five minutes.
Just give us five minutes.

52:51.919 --> 52:54.420
That's all I need is
someone fucking with my game.

52:57.591 --> 52:58.925
What's going on?

52:59.093 --> 53:01.469
Ronny, I'm in trouble.

53:01.637 --> 53:03.596
Okay.

53:05.891 --> 53:08.393
Angie's expecting twins.

53:13.190 --> 53:15.108
(chuckles)

53:17.027 --> 53:18.486
Twins?

53:18.654 --> 53:22.282
You lucky bastard.
Congratulations. That's a problem?

53:22.449 --> 53:24.534
Ronny, I ain't got room for twins.

53:24.702 --> 53:27.996
Sure you do.
You've got room here.

53:28.163 --> 53:30.206
Ronny, if I don't get a new house
or get some more bread,

53:30.374 --> 53:34.210
I got to tell one of these kids
that they got to move in with my sister.

53:34.378 --> 53:35.378
How am I gonna do that?

53:35.546 --> 53:37.881
How am I gonna tell one of 'em
that you're the one

53:38.048 --> 53:40.592
that's got to go?
I can't do that.

53:43.429 --> 53:45.722
You don't have to do
that right away, all right?

53:45.890 --> 53:48.558
I mean, how big are twins?

53:48.726 --> 53:50.059
They're like this size.

53:50.227 --> 53:52.520
Keep 'em in a drawer
for the first year.

53:52.688 --> 53:54.731
Don't worry about it.

53:54.899 --> 53:57.025
You know what I'd give for one?

53:57.192 --> 53:58.693
You're a lucky guy.

53:58.861 --> 54:01.404
- You know something? You're right.
- This ain't a problem.

54:04.742 --> 54:06.743
Mrs. Vincent, it's Sal.

54:06.911 --> 54:09.245
I have the money
for the down payment.

54:09.413 --> 54:10.872
Mrs. Vincent:
You've got the whole thing?

54:11.040 --> 54:13.583
No, actually I don't
have all the money.

54:13.751 --> 54:15.251
Mrs. Vincent:
Is there a problem?

54:15.419 --> 54:16.753
No no, there's not a problem.

54:16.921 --> 54:19.589
The situation is just complicated,
that's all, Mrs. Vincent.

54:24.219 --> 54:26.930
No, I know the deadline is Tuesday.
There's no problem about the deadline.

54:27.097 --> 54:28.598
I'm gonna have it well
before the deadline.

54:28.766 --> 54:30.767
That's not a problem.
All right? Hand to God.

54:33.103 --> 54:35.438
Oh fuck.

54:35.606 --> 54:38.191
No, you don't got to keep thanking
me about the violations thing.

54:38.359 --> 54:40.193
- It's not a problem.
- I appreciate it.

54:40.361 --> 54:42.779
Well, I appreciate you keeping
the house off the market for me.

54:42.947 --> 54:45.573
- Otherwise I couldn't afford it.
- How can you?

54:45.741 --> 54:47.825
How can I afford it?
Um...

54:47.993 --> 54:50.203
You know what, Mrs. Vincent?
You hear that train?

54:50.371 --> 54:52.789
I got another train coming by in
a second so why don't I just do this...

54:52.957 --> 54:55.458
I'm gonna call you back
when I have all the money

54:55.626 --> 54:57.085
and then we can figure out
a time to meet.

54:57.252 --> 55:00.338
- Okay, God bless you.
- Okay, God bless you too, okay?

55:02.049 --> 55:05.760
(crowd chanting)
Shot him down! Shot him down!

55:09.098 --> 55:11.349
NYPD shot him down.

55:11.517 --> 55:13.017
Fuck the police.

55:13.185 --> 55:15.561
Officer:
Back up, please. Back up.

55:16.897 --> 55:19.941
- NYPD shot him down.
- We ain't scared of you no more.

55:22.319 --> 55:23.987
Officer Dugan.

55:24.154 --> 55:27.615
Some guy,
I think he's the captain,

55:27.783 --> 55:30.201
he said that the guy I was with
yesterday is going with your guy

55:30.369 --> 55:32.078
and I'm with you.

55:32.246 --> 55:34.664
I don't know why
they keep switching us.

55:34.832 --> 55:36.165
(crowd continues yelling)

55:36.333 --> 55:38.710
Officer:
Stay behind the barricade.

55:48.387 --> 55:50.513
Get inside.

55:50.681 --> 55:52.473
No, the other side.

55:54.268 --> 55:56.519
Officer:
Back up, people. Back up.

56:05.529 --> 56:08.031
- Eddie Quinlan.
- Windows up.

56:16.040 --> 56:18.166
(car starts)

56:22.880 --> 56:25.339
Listen, kid, I'm not sure
what you did yesterday

56:25.507 --> 56:28.217
or how you did it, but today we're gonna
do things a little different, all right?

56:28.385 --> 56:31.304
Yeah.

56:31.472 --> 56:34.223
Man on radio:
Central Aviation 1, be advised.

56:34.391 --> 56:36.934
Verify arson explosion.
Respond with Central.

56:37.102 --> 56:39.896
Woman on radio:
Copy that. All medical units respond.

56:40.064 --> 56:43.149
Man on radio: Central Aviation 1, be
advised I'm in the vicinity of BK housing.

56:43.317 --> 56:44.817
We have an RMP on fire.

56:44.985 --> 56:47.570
Woman on radio:
Part of a 904. Part of a 904.

56:47.738 --> 56:50.573
Man on radio: Can you get
an eye on that second building?

56:50.741 --> 56:53.409
(radio chatter continues)

57:06.173 --> 57:09.175
Come on, cop.
I was an eyewitness.

57:10.636 --> 57:13.096
So I could get...
I could get posted here?

57:13.263 --> 57:16.849
Woman on radio:
This is 1-Central. This is 1-Central.

57:17.017 --> 57:21.395
Any units in the vicinity
of 742 Rockaway Avenue,

57:21.563 --> 57:23.648
a reported 10-10 in progress.
The owner...

57:23.816 --> 57:27.193
- (turns off radio)
- (siren blaring)

57:33.951 --> 57:35.868
Quinlan:
I'm allergic to fire

57:36.036 --> 57:38.579
and this gun is a lot lighter
than a mailbag.

57:38.747 --> 57:40.665
You sure got everything figured out.

57:40.833 --> 57:42.416
How could I not, right?

57:42.584 --> 57:45.461
Just live long enough to get
a retirement good enough

57:45.629 --> 57:48.131
to have a nice pension
and what else is there?

57:48.298 --> 57:51.425
What are you gonna do between
now and that pension?

57:51.593 --> 57:53.719
I'm gonna do the job.

57:53.887 --> 57:55.721
And what's the job?

57:55.889 --> 57:58.224
The job.

57:58.392 --> 58:00.977
Yeah, right.
It's not what you expect.

58:01.145 --> 58:03.604
It's never going to be.
It couldn't be.

58:04.815 --> 58:08.651
Just keep your eyes open
and keep walking.

58:08.819 --> 58:11.320
Whoa, you all right?

58:11.488 --> 58:13.823
- I'm cool.
- Okay.

58:13.991 --> 58:16.868
But I have won my appeal.

58:18.453 --> 58:22.290
Oh, they can do that shit?
Appeal the appeal, huh?

58:22.457 --> 58:25.418
Whatever.

58:25.586 --> 58:27.920
What's up?

58:28.088 --> 58:30.840
These motherfuckers is rabid, man.

58:31.008 --> 58:33.509
They're thirsty.
They want to eat up all the food, man.

58:33.677 --> 58:34.927
What you mean?

58:35.095 --> 58:36.721
Fucking lawyer's telling me
they're talking about charging me

58:36.889 --> 58:38.306
with some shit from 10 years ago.

58:38.473 --> 58:40.933
That's just gonna get thrown out.
Don't worry about that.

58:41.101 --> 58:43.394
That shit ain't gonna stick.

58:43.562 --> 58:46.022
Fucking freedom ain't free, boy.
I'm telling you.

58:46.190 --> 58:49.025
I'm putting these motherfucker's
grandchildren through college.

58:49.193 --> 58:50.526
Officer:
Hey hey hey.

58:50.694 --> 58:53.362
Uniform got popped in
Bed-Stuy, didn't make it.

58:53.530 --> 58:55.698
New guy, Melvin Panton.

58:55.866 --> 58:57.533
(officers murmuring)

58:57.701 --> 59:00.036
Jesus fucking Christ.

59:06.460 --> 59:08.377
It's a fucking shame,

59:08.545 --> 59:10.922
a young guy like that.

59:12.090 --> 59:14.383
Probably just starting a family.

59:15.802 --> 59:18.179
Yeah yeah, probably.
Probably did.

59:20.390 --> 59:22.391
Hey, Sal.
It's Angela.

59:22.559 --> 59:24.810
- Tell her I'll call her back.
- She says it's important.

59:24.978 --> 59:26.938
All right.

01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:12.233
- Get up.
- (groans)

01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:14.485
- Oh, thanks.
- Any news?

01:00:14.653 --> 01:00:17.196
No, nothing. Nothing.

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:27.081
Angie's as tough as they come.
She'll pull through.

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:30.960
She'll be back to calling you
an asshole in next to no time.

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:33.129
(laughs)

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:37.091
Thanks.

01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:38.551
Anytime.

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:40.344
(phone vibrating)

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:42.680
Oh shit.

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:48.686
Yeah, hi.
How are you?

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:52.440
Yeah, I'm aware that
the deadline is tomorrow.

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:54.150
I'm well aware of that.

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:56.319
But the good news is it's all settled.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:59.071
Uh-huh, all good. Yup.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:03.075
No, I... well, I can't really
talk right now.

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:06.495
But if you call me in the AM
I'll do it first thing.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.372
Yeah yeah yeah.
Okay.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.291
You too. Bye bye.

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.048
Everything okay?

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:19.008
Mr. Rosario.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:21.010
Yeah, hey. So the asthma?

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:24.472
Well, your wife has significant traces
of wood mold in her lungs.

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:27.224
- Wood mold.
- When you have wood inside your house

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:29.810
- the particles travel in the air...
- I know all about the mold.

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:31.645
Well, if your wife's case,
because of her asthma

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:34.148
her lungs are working three times
as hard as they should,

01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:36.942
which is jeopardizing her and the twins.

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:41.197
One of the babies is significantly
smaller than the other.

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:43.657
- But they're okay though?
- For now.

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:46.619
Mr. Rosario, have you
considered moving?

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:51.791
Yeah, I have.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:21.695
(siren wailing)

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:28.994
- Fuck you, man. Fuck you.
- Whoa whoa.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:31.414
Whoa whoa whoa!

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:34.583
He accused me
of stealing fucking candy.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.752
Stop. Whoa! Whoa!

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.921
Hey hey! Stop!

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:41.257
Calm down, everybody.

01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:44.760
Just...

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:47.263
You hear me now?
Huh?

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.932
We got this shit working like clockwork.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.059
You want to go and fuck up our money?

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:54.562
Get your little bitch ass up, man.

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:57.189
- Don't kill me.
- What'd you tell them niggas, huh?

01:02:57.357 --> 01:02:59.984
- Don't kill me, man.
- I can send your ass.

01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:02.945
Uh-huh, I hope your ass
can fly, nigga.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:04.572
Do your little ass dirty.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:08.951
Go go go.

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:12.329
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Get the fuck down.

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:14.707
Stay the fuck down
and keep your mouth shut.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:16.959
What are you doing?
Get the fuck off me.

01:03:18.587 --> 01:03:20.629
(pots clatter)

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:27.428
Get that shit in the bag.
Get it in the bag. Hurry up.

01:03:27.596 --> 01:03:29.180
Here they come.
Come on.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.399
(gunshot)

01:03:45.405 --> 01:03:46.447
Freeze!

01:03:46.615 --> 01:03:48.324
Go, move move move!

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:51.118
- Let's go.
- (gunfire)

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:53.496
- (gunshot)
- Fuck.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.247
See, I need you to think about it.

01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:57.791
Think about it real good
and hard, man,

01:03:57.959 --> 01:03:59.335
before you fuck with my money.

01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:00.920
Look at me.
Look at me, motherfucker.

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:02.338
Look at me.
I'm not playing with you, nigga.

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:04.632
I will burn you
in your motherfucking eye.

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:06.342
What did you say
to the fucking police?

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:09.053
- You first, what happened?
- He put candy in his pocket...

01:04:09.221 --> 01:04:10.971
Yo, man, why you
asking him first, man?

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:13.516
- Just relax.
- This is bullshit.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.518
- What happened?
- He came in and put candy in his pocket.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.144
That's a damn lie.
I didn't take shit from you.

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:20.105
- You take candy.
- Hey, I said shut up.

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:22.149
It was candy?

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:25.861
Put the gun down.
Motherfucker, get on the ground.

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:27.863
Get on the ground.
Put that gun down.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:30.950
- Get the fuck off me! Get off me!
- (gunshots)

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:34.036
Drop it. Drop your gun.
Let's see your hands.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:36.539
Let's see your fucking hands.
Do not even think about it.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:39.750
(whispering)

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:41.752
C-Rayz, get over here.
Give me some cuffs.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.797
Put the fucking guns down.
Don't you fucking resist.

01:04:44.965 --> 01:04:46.632
Up against the wall.

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.719
(gunshots)

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:06.652
Red:
Let's just shoot this nigga, man.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.946
He's bleeding all over my shirt.

01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:10.281
Red.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:16.245
- What's up?
- Man, this motherfucker ain't...

01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:21.750
What, y'all switch your names now?

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:23.961
I thought your name was, uh,

01:05:24.129 --> 01:05:26.380
K-Pebbles or something.

01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:30.009
Your name's now Red?

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:31.927
No.

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:35.180
Oh.

01:05:35.348 --> 01:05:38.267
Oh, you're Red.

01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:42.771
(distant siren blaring)

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.815
Caz man, this is
the snitch nigger right here.

01:05:44.983 --> 01:05:48.402
This is the motherfucking reason why
police are running up on us and shit.

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:50.446
- This motherfucker right here.
- (whimpers)

01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:52.615
Fucking... the whips,
the stash, everything, man.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.074
We've got to switch up
the whole operation.

01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:56.619
(men yelling)

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:59.747
You fucking want to shoot a cop,
motherfucker?

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:01.457
Show me your
fucking hands, asshole.

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:04.209
Give me your fucking hands.
Call me a pig?

01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:06.128
I hope he's gonna pay
for the strap on my book bag.

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:08.464
- Hey, I don't want to say this again...
- Fuck you, man!

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:12.092
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Look me in the eyes.

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:14.928
Do you want a friend?
I could be your friend.

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:17.306
Okay? We'll work this out.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:21.310
Yeah, everything's fine.
We're gonna work this out.

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.896
I'm gonna go check his ID.

01:06:24.064 --> 01:06:26.690
Just keep everybody calm.

01:06:26.858 --> 01:06:28.692
Yeah, all right.

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:32.655
No no, you go check, I'm staying.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.406
- Eddie, come on.
- I want you to go.

01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:36.158
Eddie, don't embarrass me.
I've got it.

01:06:41.456 --> 01:06:44.083
Woman:
Hey, man, that's a good kid.

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:45.334
He ain't do nothing.

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:48.087
Man: Fuck you, pig.
Get the fuck out of here.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:03.769
(train rattling)

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:09.733
Come in, Central.

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:13.320
It's been three years
since we got raided.

01:07:13.488 --> 01:07:15.406
About that.

01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:17.783
But look, man, you let them
kill this little kid,

01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:20.452
that ain't gonna do shit
but bring heat to the neighborhood.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.204
You know that, B.

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:28.293
Red: How come this dude is always
trying to avoid shit, man?

01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:30.546
Answer me that.
Y'all don't catch that shit?

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:33.549
Come on, Caz. Every time it's time
to put some work in, Tango,

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:35.801
you're always trying to preach
some turn-the-other-cheek shit.

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:38.011
What up with that, bro?
Yo, Caz, this your man and all.

01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:39.638
I don't give a fuck how many
guns I've seen him hold.

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:42.141
I ain't seen you bust
a motherfucking thing, bro.

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:44.560
For all we know,
you could be the bitch ass...

01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:46.103
Motherfucker!

01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:48.355
Now you want
to see me bust, motherfucker?

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:51.233
You want me to make that shit official?
Say some shit.

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:53.694
I'll put a fucking hole in you, bitch.

01:07:53.862 --> 01:07:55.571
- Say something.
- Caz: Kick back.

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:57.197
I want to kill you so bad right now.

01:07:57.365 --> 01:07:59.825
I said kick the fuck back.

01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:05.748
(men shouting)

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:23.348
Please, man, I didn't take shit.

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:26.477
I got enough money right here
to buy you, your family and a Slurpee.

01:08:26.644 --> 01:08:27.978
He threatened my family.

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:29.604
- He threatened my family.
- Fuck your family, man.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:32.274
- Wait a second here.
- You put candy in your bag.

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:35.152
Get off the bag.
Get off the bag right now!

01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:42.326
Fuck it, Caz.
What you want to do, man?

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:49.625
Pick this motherfucker up.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:53.377
- Your legs work, stand up.
- No, man. No, man.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:55.631
- Think this is a fucking game?
- You think we're playing?

01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:58.216
- You been talking, man?
- Yeah, he's been talking.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:01.261
Answer the question, man.
Answer the question.

01:09:01.429 --> 01:09:05.057
They were gonna shoot me.
They were gonna shoot me.

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:10.687
- No, man.
- Gonna ask you one more time.

01:09:10.854 --> 01:09:13.148
You been talking?
You been talking?

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:15.442
No, man. No, man.

01:09:17.612 --> 01:09:19.488
Get your grill fixed, man.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:20.823
- What?
- You believe this shit?

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.908
- Come on, man.
- Red, you see this?

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.661
Go kiss your mama.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.496
Snitch ass.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:29.665
Can't believe
we ain't murdered this nigger.

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:35.462
How many times I got to tell you?
Get out of here.

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:39.049
All right, I asked you to put it down.
Why you got to go and get the bag?

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:42.010
- I ain't do nothing, man.
- Give me your arms.

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:44.263
I tried to be nice to you, all right?
I gave you a chance.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.849
- I gave you a chance.
- Oh fuck.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:48.975
(gunshot)

01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:51.854
Sal, what are you doing?

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:55.649
- Ah!
- What the fuck?

01:09:55.817 --> 01:09:59.027
- C-Rayz, make sure he's down.
- Yeah yeah, he's down.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.697
I didn't even fucking see that guy.
Is he down?

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:03.699
Holy fuck.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:23.343
Woman:
No one's holding you responsible.

01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:26.597
Why are you so adamant
on taking blame?

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:29.474
Because I knew I should have stayed.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:32.853
You knew your fellow officer

01:10:33.021 --> 01:10:35.731
would pull his gun
on a crowd of unarmed kids?

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:38.400
And then let off two shots

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.569
within inches of this kid's head?

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:44.239
I knew I should have stayed
and I didn't.

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:47.159
I just...

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.621
I let it go...
just let it go.

01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:55.208
(whispers)

01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:58.962
Ahem.

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:00.881
This student,

01:11:01.049 --> 01:11:02.966
he had $400

01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:06.219
and an ounce of marijuana
in his possession.

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:11.183
Is it possible that Officer Quinlan

01:11:11.351 --> 01:11:15.103
was overzealous in apprehending
a known drug suspect?

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.942
Man:
And said drug suspect's fear

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:22.194
of a felony charge

01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:24.279
led him to resist arrest.

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:26.782
(sighs)

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:31.119
Officer Quinlan
shouldn't have been there.

01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:57.312
You've been
an officer long enough to know

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.315
that Quinlan was the casualty
of a bad shooting.

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:06.655
A casualty needed to preserve
the trust of the public.

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:11.243
We need this to be drug related.

01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:15.831
We need a decorated officer's
testimony to back that up.

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:18.959
Now while your service record is not

01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:21.670
commendable or extraordinary,

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:23.839
it will satisfy.

01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:27.175
So would you please,

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.844
for the record,

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:31.847
recount the events
of that day in question?

01:12:33.141 --> 01:12:35.392
(sighs)

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:46.319
Fuck you.

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:48.780
He shouldn't have been there.

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:54.870
Could you inform Officer Dugan

01:12:55.038 --> 01:12:58.165
that this board can bring him up
on departmental charges?

01:12:58.332 --> 01:13:01.668
Let me remind you
he retires in a few days.

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:24.107
- Hey, kid.
- Man: Quinlan.

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:27.402
- You'll do fine.
- Let's go.

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.988
- Sorry.
- You'll do fine.

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:34.576
Come on.

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:48.048
Mrs. Vincent:
Hi, it's me again.

01:13:48.216 --> 01:13:50.759
Today's the day
when everything goes down.

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:53.970
Please let me know. My son has to
go ahead with the sale of the house.

01:13:54.138 --> 01:13:56.556
(door shuts)

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:00.811
- Hey.
- Great thinking out there today.

01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:03.897
Listen. Let me know if you want
to get out of this raid tonight.

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:07.400
- I'll make sure you get paid.
- Nah, that's... I'm good. I'm good.

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:09.444
- Good one.
- (door shuts)

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:12.781
- Gentlemen, nice job there today.
- Captain.

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:14.116
- You made me proud.
- (chattering)

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.701
- Sal, you look like shit.
- Take some vitamins, G.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.124
Here you are, man.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:25.127
Thanks for watching my back, Sal.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.963
I heard they're gonna pin
a medal on you, bro.

01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:29.881
If I had given it
a second thought,

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:32.092
I wouldn't have lifted a finger for you.

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.511
I would've done
what I came there to do, all right?

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:38.390
So don't go patting me
on the back, all right?

01:14:38.558 --> 01:14:40.100
I don't deserve it.

01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:55.115
Caz: You know what
them fucking Mexicans do?

01:14:55.283 --> 01:14:58.535
The Mexicans... them motherfuckers
will wrap you up in plastic,

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:01.204
throw some taco sauce
and gasoline on the motherfucker

01:15:01.372 --> 01:15:03.039
and burn your ass up.

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:05.542
The fucking Dominicans...

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:07.794
they take pliers,
put 'em on your nuts,

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:10.005
squeeze your nuts like a walnut.

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:13.508
And then they throw fucking
taco sauce and gasoline on the plastic

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:15.594
and burn your ass up.

01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:18.430
The Columbians...

01:15:18.598 --> 01:15:21.516
the Columbians?
And I'm just a connect.

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:23.185
What you think
they gonna do to me?

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.563
- Yeah, I know, man.
- I've gotta deal with this shit, man.

01:15:28.399 --> 01:15:30.692
Fuck. And then
fucking Red pulling his bullshit?

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.319
This nigga Red, man...

01:15:32.486 --> 01:15:34.196
tired of playing the two-gun.

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:36.865
Motherfucker want to be
Kobe Bryant up in this bitch.

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:39.201
What, you think I didn't see that?

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:42.954
So what you saying?
Hmm?

01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:44.456
Since I've been eight down... what?

01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:46.291
I don't know
what the fuck is going on?

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:48.543
I just hit the block
with my eyes wide shut, right?

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:50.962
Nah nah, Caz.
I know you know what it is.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:56.051
You know what it is.

01:15:58.846 --> 01:16:01.223
I did think he was gonna toss
youngblood over though.

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.934
Why? He ain't the one snitching.

01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:06.436
Somebody is, though.

01:16:06.604 --> 01:16:09.397
You'd better believe that.
But it ain't him.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:13.652
I'm tired of this shit, man.

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:16.571
I'm trying to do some other shit.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.866
What the fuck?
And these motherfuckers are trying

01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:23.370
to make it their business
to lock me the fuck up.

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:25.914
Caz, look here, man.

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:31.795
I know a way you can shut
this whole thing down

01:16:31.963 --> 01:16:33.630
and still make your paper.

01:16:33.798 --> 01:16:35.257
How's that?

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.217
These cats I know uptown...

01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:39.636
they want
to buy from us, wholesale.

01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:43.098
They're at the table asking 10 bricks, hard.
You just gotta meet 'em.

01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:45.642
Are we on the same fucking planet?

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:47.269
Buddy, I just got the fuck out.

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:49.396
Caz. Listen, man.

01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:51.398
What the fuck?
Why not now?

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:53.608
(sighs)

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:56.778
How much longer you gonna be dodging
bullets out here in these streets, man?

01:16:57.863 --> 01:17:00.073
How long before one
of these motherfucking knuckleheads

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:01.533
catches us slipping,

01:17:01.701 --> 01:17:04.119
put one in the back
of our fucking heads?

01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:06.329
I ain't got to tell you.

01:17:06.497 --> 01:17:07.789
You already know.

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:10.125
These streets got
an expiration date on them.

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:14.296
Tango, you trust
these motherfuckers?

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.589
- Yeah. Hell yeah.
- "Hell yeah"?

01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:19.259
- That ain't sound real confident.
- Yeah, I trust 'em, man.

01:17:19.427 --> 01:17:21.511
I wouldn't even come to you
with this unless I did.

01:17:23.014 --> 01:17:26.016
You take this shit,
the whole cut for yourself

01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:27.976
and you vanish.

01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:30.812
Fuck these streets.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.480
Get ghost, right?

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.774
You're goddamn right, get ghost.

01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:37.819
Be a ghost and be a legend
at the same time.

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:43.450
You already know.

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:48.913
Set it up.

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:15.148
(gun clatters)

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.543
(beeping)

01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:18.795
Computerized voice:
Record activate.

01:19:20.548 --> 01:19:22.549
Record activate.

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:25.593
Four.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.401
(hip-hop music playing)

01:19:54.498 --> 01:19:57.208
Hey, Caz. Hey.

01:19:58.419 --> 01:20:00.378
- Welcome back.
- What up, Tango?

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:03.465
- Hey, baby.
- (laughs)

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:05.925
- What's up, man?
- Yes yes.

01:20:06.093 --> 01:20:08.011
- It's all great.
- I'll tell you, man...

01:20:08.179 --> 01:20:09.512
when y'all whipping pass go on the low...

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.973
whoo... y'all motherfuckers
go on the low.

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:15.518
This is Gutta and Slim.

01:20:18.856 --> 01:20:20.648
Lemme tell you one thing, man.

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:23.735
Giuliani didn't clean up the city.

01:20:23.903 --> 01:20:27.405
Video games and television did it.

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:29.324
That's what cleaned up the streets.

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:32.660
Come on, man. 'Cause y'all remember
when everybody was outside.

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:34.412
If you was two years old,

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.998
if you was 102,
you was outside.

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:40.460
- Shit.
- So like me,

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:45.840
I like the time when everybody
was face to face, you know?

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:48.551
That's how I like to do my business...

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:51.262
face to face.

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:54.182
See, Caz,
the way we like to do things is

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:58.186
- we like to come together...
- How long y'all be knowing Tango, man?

01:21:01.565 --> 01:21:03.816
You know how he got his name?

01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:06.361
- Don't tell that fucking story, man.
- No no, it's all good.

01:21:06.529 --> 01:21:09.656
- No no. Yeah.
- In my man's hood,

01:21:09.823 --> 01:21:14.160
the boy had the nicest pair of hands
in the whole neighborhood.

01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:16.538
He would...
he had this little standoff shit

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:18.540
where he would square off on a cat

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.875
and he had this little slow rock.
You know what I'm saying?

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:22.961
Cats would be mouthing off to him,
he'd just, you know,

01:21:23.128 --> 01:21:25.129
keep his head down a little bit
under the eye of the motherfucker

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:26.714
like this. All of a sudden...
bong bong!

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:28.591
- two right to the mouth,
you know what I mean?

01:21:28.759 --> 01:21:30.843
He's about to fucking tango
or rock the boy...

01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:32.220
I don't know what the fuck
he gonna do. It's his style.

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:36.015
This shit right here... like he about
to start tangoing or something, yo.

01:21:36.183 --> 01:21:39.269
It was nice though. It was nice.

01:21:39.436 --> 01:21:41.854
Yeah yeah.

01:21:43.023 --> 01:21:46.609
Gutta, what kind
of whip you pushing, man?

01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:48.528
Oh, man.

01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:51.698
I drive an Audi A8.

01:21:55.869 --> 01:21:58.621
- I want it.
- Cool.

01:22:00.708 --> 01:22:03.418
No, I mean,
I want you to let me borrow it.

01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:06.588
You borrow mine
and we give it back the next day.

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:08.590
See, that way

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:12.552
we can make sure you get
everything you asking for.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.762
And we get the same.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:18.766
Feel me? And I get
the chance to test-drive your shit.

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:20.935
(laughs)

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:24.063
What about price?

01:22:24.231 --> 01:22:26.482
Caz: We already talked
to Tango about that.

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:29.027
Since you his people,
why don't we just keep it steady?

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.407
Slim: Well...

01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:37.660
you name the place
and you name the time.

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:44.292
Let's bring it in.

01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:49.464
There it is.

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:02.352
Let me get... let me get
by you real quick, man.

01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:05.813
- Oh, Tango, you had enough?
- I'm good, B.

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:07.982
- I'll be back in a minute.
- (men chuckle)

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:10.151
Fucking lightweight, right?

01:23:38.263 --> 01:23:40.223
(clatters)

01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:48.272
- Yo, I'm in here, man.
- Man: Man, I gotta take a piss.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.318
Get the fuck outta here!
Get the fuck outta here!

01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:05.707
Man:
Got everything here...

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:09.585
the riot helmet, the mace,

01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:12.714
patrol guide,

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:15.007
shield.

01:24:16.343 --> 01:24:18.219
(clears throat)

01:24:55.507 --> 01:24:57.216
You're done.

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:01.929
That's it?

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:04.766
Yeah, that's it.

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:07.935
Yeah. Gotta take a leak.

01:25:31.251 --> 01:25:33.252
(phone ringing)

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:38.800
- Bill: Hello.
- Bill.

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:41.427
- It's Clarence.
- What's going on?

01:25:41.595 --> 01:25:43.054
Listen.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:46.349
I'm out, man.

01:25:46.517 --> 01:25:48.643
Uh-huh. Meet me at Joey's.
Let's get a coffee.

01:25:48.811 --> 01:25:51.187
Nah, I don't want to meet you.
There ain't nothing to talk about, okay?

01:25:51.355 --> 01:25:52.480
It's over. I'm off the case.

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:54.816
Now if the feds wanna charge me,
they can do that.

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:56.567
Whatever else comes down,
I'll deal with it, okay?

01:25:56.735 --> 01:25:58.486
But I'm done, man.
I'm off the case.

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:00.780
You know, I told 'em
that you'd see this through to the end,

01:26:00.948 --> 01:26:03.157
but they knew better.
They prepared for this. She expected this.

01:26:03.325 --> 01:26:04.992
They got their evidence.
They don't need you anymore.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.537
- This is gonna happen.
- When?

01:26:07.704 --> 01:26:09.497
I don't want you anywhere
near this anymore, okay?

01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:11.624
Bill!
When are you moving on Caz?

01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:13.209
You listen to me.
Stay away from it, Clarence.

01:26:13.377 --> 01:26:15.044
(beeps)

01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:23.511
- Gonna do you, son.
- There you go. There you go.

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:26.514
- Ah!
- In your face, bitch.

01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:30.184
Yo, you seen Caz?

01:26:30.352 --> 01:26:32.103
I don't know, son.
It's hot out here right now.

01:26:32.271 --> 01:26:34.146
- I don't know what to tell you, son.
- You ain't seen him?

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:36.357
I thought you wasn't coming
around out here today, Tango.

01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:39.527
- (revs loudly)
- Hey, ain't gotta talk to me like that.

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:53.541
- (beeps)
- Yo, we out of here.

01:27:00.883 --> 01:27:02.884
(train rattling)

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:15.855
- All right.
- Yeah, you know.

01:27:16.023 --> 01:27:17.189
- Yeah.
- I knew that man.

01:27:17.357 --> 01:27:19.734
- What's up?
- I've been looking for you, calling you.

01:27:19.902 --> 01:27:21.569
- That phone card shit don't work.
- We gotta get some paper together.

01:27:21.737 --> 01:27:23.696
You gotta get the fuck up
outta Dodge right now, B.

01:27:23.864 --> 01:27:26.073
- Why?
- 'Cause there's a problem with the deal.

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:27.909
No no, there ain't no problem, man.

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:29.827
Ain't no problem I can't fix.

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:31.662
- Caz.
- Look, we getting this money.

01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:34.373
No, listen to me.
You cannot take this fucking deal.

01:27:34.541 --> 01:27:36.959
Caz, listen to me.
You cannot take this deal.

01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:40.129
Why, Tango?

01:27:40.297 --> 01:27:42.590
Can we just take a ride, please?

01:27:46.637 --> 01:27:50.264
Caz, please. Let's just...
let's just take a ride, man.

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:55.436
Yeah, let's take a ride.
Come on, man. I'm hungry.

01:27:55.604 --> 01:27:57.897
(gunshots)

01:27:58.065 --> 01:28:00.274
(people screaming)

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:02.443
(tires screech)

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:05.780
Caz.

01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:12.119
Fuck!

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.463
Aw, shit!

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:24.757
What the fuck?
What happened, man?

01:28:24.925 --> 01:28:27.760
- Go get fucking help, man!
- Call 911!

01:28:27.928 --> 01:28:29.762
- Go get the car!
- Fucking go get the car, man!

01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:32.640
Don't just stand the fuck around!
Go get some help, man!

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:36.310
Go get some fucking help!
Go get some help, man! Get the car!

01:28:36.478 --> 01:28:38.270
Man: You've got to go.
Come on. You've got to go.

01:28:38.438 --> 01:28:40.314
I've got this.
You've got to go. Come on.

01:28:40.482 --> 01:28:44.360
Come on!
Go ahead! Call 911.

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:15.641
(tires screech)

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:23.858
Bill: Everybody give us some room.
Johnny, can you clear the room?

01:29:24.026 --> 01:29:26.485
- I saw y'all out there. Y'all were out there.
- I tried to reach you.

01:29:26.653 --> 01:29:29.321
The whole block gets shot up, y'all just
sit there, don't do nothing about it?

01:29:29.489 --> 01:29:30.865
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

01:29:31.033 --> 01:29:32.950
- I almost got my damn head blown off.
- Calm down.

01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:35.703
We didn't know anything about it
till after it happened, okay?

01:29:35.871 --> 01:29:37.288
- He's probably gonna...
- Your man Red tried to steal the deal

01:29:37.456 --> 01:29:40.166
for himself, plain and simple.
He contacted our UC.

01:29:40.333 --> 01:29:41.709
We didn't know he was
gonna shoot up Phillips.

01:29:41.877 --> 01:29:43.544
- Now did you get hit?
- The fuck you care?

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:46.422
All right, let's stay with the ball here.
Now you know this Red.

01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:48.549
He's got a few priors,
so he's in our system.

01:29:48.717 --> 01:29:51.302
What the fuck are you talking about Red?
That's some petty project bullshit.

01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:54.346
Now my case was with Phillips.
He's either dead or a vegetable.

01:29:54.514 --> 01:29:56.766
- I'm done here.
- So Red gets a pass?

01:29:56.933 --> 01:30:01.228
- That it? Red gets a fucking pass?!
- Okay okay! Calm...

01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:03.314
- just calm down.
- Congratulations.

01:30:03.482 --> 01:30:06.567
You managed to come all the way up here
and not do one damn bit of police work!

01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:08.277
I'm doing police work,

01:30:08.445 --> 01:30:11.697
but that doesn't mean I go back
in the jungle and clean up monkey shit.

01:30:11.865 --> 01:30:13.657
- Hey! No!
- (men grunting)

01:30:13.825 --> 01:30:15.576
- Hey!
- Motherfucker.

01:30:15.744 --> 01:30:18.579
Get your fucking hands off of me.

01:30:18.747 --> 01:30:20.915
- Easy!
- That's enough! That's enough!

01:30:21.083 --> 01:30:23.459
Stop. I got it.
Hey! All right!

01:30:23.627 --> 01:30:27.046
Hey, you are...
you are off undercover immediately!

01:30:27.214 --> 01:30:29.757
Now you go see
the psych doctor for two weeks.

01:30:29.925 --> 01:30:34.261
And you might've... you might've
fucked yourself out of detective.

01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:36.347
No he didn't.

01:30:36.515 --> 01:30:38.599
I should've made
this motherfucker sergeant.

01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:41.102
(door opens)

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:45.231
Jesus Christ.

01:30:45.398 --> 01:30:48.734
Are you finished
with your self-righteous bullshit, man?

01:30:49.778 --> 01:30:51.779
You're nobody's victim.

01:30:51.947 --> 01:30:54.532
You wanted undercover,
you pushed to make grade

01:30:54.699 --> 01:30:57.451
and you got it!
Do you understand?

01:30:57.619 --> 01:30:59.245
You made it. You got it.

01:30:59.412 --> 01:31:00.955
(laughs)
You got it.

01:31:01.123 --> 01:31:04.333
You got what you asked for.

01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:08.712
Take your life back.
Take your life back.

01:31:11.466 --> 01:31:13.175
Take my fucking life back?

01:31:13.343 --> 01:31:16.637
Huh? Take my fucking life back?

01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:56.677
(woman moaning)

01:31:58.013 --> 01:32:00.014
(voices talking quietly)

01:32:10.192 --> 01:32:12.193
(moaning)

01:32:14.571 --> 01:32:17.364
Yeah.
Don't stop. Yeah.

01:32:18.909 --> 01:32:20.618
- You like that shit, baby?
- Yeah.

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:22.828
- Feels good, baby?
- Yeah, it feels so good.

01:32:22.996 --> 01:32:24.914
- Yeah, you like it deep.
- Yeah.

01:32:25.081 --> 01:32:27.374
- You like it deep?
- Yeah. Oh.

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:30.211
Oh, that's my papa.

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:32.171
Oh, yeah.
Make it feel good.

01:32:32.339 --> 01:32:34.340
(moaning continues)

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:41.388
(exhales)

01:32:49.105 --> 01:32:51.106
(voices continue)

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.281
(moaning louder)

01:33:30.689 --> 01:33:32.356
Eddie, I'm in here.

01:33:32.524 --> 01:33:34.358
Hey.

01:33:35.485 --> 01:33:37.611
Hey, Papa.
Sorry you had to see that.

01:33:37.779 --> 01:33:39.405
It's all right.

01:33:39.572 --> 01:33:42.116
No judgments here.

01:33:46.663 --> 01:33:48.998
It's your fault.
You know you came kind of early.

01:33:49.165 --> 01:33:50.791
You're right.

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:12.313
Hi.

01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:25.868
(shoes clatter)

01:34:27.996 --> 01:34:29.705
Are you all right?

01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:56.023
(whispers)
What you doing?

01:35:03.239 --> 01:35:05.032
I got you something.

01:35:07.202 --> 01:35:09.620
Wow.
Expensive, huh?

01:35:09.788 --> 01:35:11.580
You see how much money
you pay me?

01:35:14.959 --> 01:35:16.668
What's that say?

01:35:16.836 --> 01:35:19.338
"We've got nothing but time,

01:35:19.506 --> 01:35:21.215
but time won't give us time."

01:35:21.383 --> 01:35:23.509
You know,
that's an old Boy George song.

01:35:23.676 --> 01:35:26.261
You probably don't know it, right?

01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:29.348
it reminds me of you.

01:35:29.516 --> 01:35:31.392
Come with me.

01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:36.814
Come on.
To Connecticut?

01:35:38.066 --> 01:35:41.110
Connecticut, anywhere.
It doesn't matter to me.

01:35:41.277 --> 01:35:43.445
I don't care.
I just want to be with you.

01:35:47.659 --> 01:35:49.785
Eddie, I... I, uh...

01:35:52.122 --> 01:35:54.581
you don't know what you want.

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:58.836
I don't know how to be,

01:35:59.003 --> 01:36:01.213
you know,
what you want me to be.

01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:03.757
What you are is fine with me.

01:36:06.928 --> 01:36:08.720
Better than fine.

01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:14.601
(chuckles)

01:36:22.986 --> 01:36:25.821
(softly)
#Come with me #

01:36:26.948 --> 01:36:29.658
#My love #

01:36:32.704 --> 01:36:34.955
#To the sea #

01:36:35.123 --> 01:36:37.958
#The sea of love #

01:36:39.919 --> 01:36:42.463
#I wanna tell you... #

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:44.465
Eddie, leave.

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:46.133
#How much I... #

01:36:46.301 --> 01:36:47.759
Go.

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:55.976
#How much I... #

01:36:56.144 --> 01:36:58.645
- Look at me.
- No, get the fuck out.

01:37:08.698 --> 01:37:10.407
Okay.

01:37:11.618 --> 01:37:13.577
Thanks for the watch.

01:37:41.397 --> 01:37:43.398
(train rattling)

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:14.221
(sighs)

01:39:56.991 --> 01:39:58.659
(engine starts)

01:40:07.502 --> 01:40:09.503
(men chatting)

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:16.343
All right, listen up.

01:40:16.511 --> 01:40:19.429
I just got the call.
The operation's scrubbed.

01:40:19.597 --> 01:40:22.516
- Oh!
- Since you're on the clock anyway,

01:40:22.684 --> 01:40:26.353
why don't you get some buy money,
do some B&Bs on Pittman?

01:40:26.521 --> 01:40:28.438
- Svaldi?
- Yes, sir.

01:40:28.606 --> 01:40:30.190
- My office first thing tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

01:40:30.358 --> 01:40:33.402
- C-Rayz, you down?
- Hey, Ronny, gonna hit the titty bar.

01:40:33.569 --> 01:40:34.986
- You wanna go?
- No, later.

01:40:35.154 --> 01:40:38.281
- (cell phone ringing)
- C-Rayz, let's go, babe.

01:40:38.449 --> 01:40:40.701
No, sir.
I'm going home to see my lady.

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:42.536
Peace, man.

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:49.042
(beeps)

01:40:53.381 --> 01:40:54.548
Sal.

01:40:56.676 --> 01:40:57.843
Sal, your phone.

01:40:58.010 --> 01:40:59.928
(office phone rings)

01:41:00.096 --> 01:41:02.389
Hello.

01:41:02.557 --> 01:41:04.224
Hey, Angie,
it's Ronny.

01:41:05.351 --> 01:41:06.685
I don't know.
He just stepped out.

01:41:06.853 --> 01:41:08.437
He left his cell behind.

01:41:08.604 --> 01:41:09.896
Uh-huh.

01:41:10.064 --> 01:41:13.108
To tell you the truth, Angie, I don't know
what's been going on with him lately.

01:41:21.576 --> 01:41:23.493
Angie, let me call you back
later on, all right?

01:41:23.661 --> 01:41:26.621
Yeah, don't worry.
I've got it covered. All right, bye.

01:41:49.604 --> 01:41:51.313
(exhales)

01:42:26.474 --> 01:42:28.517
(brakes squeak)

01:42:31.395 --> 01:42:33.647
Huh? What the fuck?
Are you following me? Huh?

01:42:33.815 --> 01:42:35.482
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Are you following me?

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:37.234
- Yeah, I'm following you.
- You Internal Affairs now?

01:42:37.401 --> 01:42:38.610
- Are you IA?
- IA?

01:42:38.778 --> 01:42:40.987
Are you IA?!
What, are you wired?

01:42:41.155 --> 01:42:42.447
- Let's see this.
- Check. Go ahead.

01:42:42.615 --> 01:42:45.492
- You wanna have a look, have a look.
- Don't fuck with me right now.

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:47.327
- Don't fuck with me.
- I know what you wanna do.

01:42:47.495 --> 01:42:49.788
- I'm telling you do not fuck with me.
- You think this is gonna help?

01:42:49.956 --> 01:42:53.208
You're gonna make it worse.
You're ready to risk your life over money?

01:42:53.376 --> 01:42:54.835
- Over drug money?
- Get off your high horse.

01:42:55.002 --> 01:42:57.838
What do you know about it?
You don't have any fucking kids!

01:42:58.005 --> 01:42:59.422
I would do anything for mine!

01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:01.174
- Do not fuck with me, Ronny!
- Would you do any...

01:43:01.342 --> 01:43:03.176
would you fucking do anything, Sal?

01:43:03.344 --> 01:43:05.804
Would you fucking do anything?

01:43:07.181 --> 01:43:09.683
You're fucking blind to all you've got!

01:43:11.519 --> 01:43:13.520
Go home.
Look at me, Sal. Look at me.

01:43:13.688 --> 01:43:16.773
Go home, kiss Angie good night,

01:43:16.941 --> 01:43:19.234
kiss your kids good night,

01:43:19.402 --> 01:43:22.445
get some fucking sleep
and thank God for all you've got.

01:43:26.534 --> 01:43:28.285
I'm fucked...

01:43:28.452 --> 01:43:31.162
I'm fucked... I'm fucked up.
Ronny, I'm all fucked up.

01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:33.540
Oh, fuck.

01:43:33.708 --> 01:43:35.667
You're right. I...

01:43:37.336 --> 01:43:39.504
I can't go home.

01:43:39.672 --> 01:43:41.715
You know what?
I let 'em...

01:43:43.467 --> 01:43:45.260
- I let 'em down, Ronny. I can't...
- No, you didn't let 'em...

01:43:45.428 --> 01:43:47.721
- no, you didn't let 'em down.
- The fuck I didn't. I know I did.

01:43:47.889 --> 01:43:50.557
- You didn't let 'em down.
- Fuck. You know too much.

01:43:50.725 --> 01:43:53.184
You know that?
You are a fucking piece of work.

01:43:53.352 --> 01:43:55.937
You'd do the same for me.
Let's go to Dillon's, grab a beer,

01:43:56.105 --> 01:43:58.565
watch the end of the ballgame.

01:44:00.276 --> 01:44:02.402
You wanna do that?

01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:05.030
- Go to Dillon's?
- Yeah.

01:44:05.197 --> 01:44:07.490
All right. Oh, boy.

01:44:07.658 --> 01:44:09.743
(chuckles)

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:12.329
All right.

01:44:12.496 --> 01:44:14.873
- I'll follow you, all right?
- Here's your phone.

01:44:16.208 --> 01:44:17.584
Angie called.
You know, she's worried.

01:44:17.752 --> 01:44:20.211
We're all worried, man.
You know, we love you.

01:44:20.379 --> 01:44:23.131
I know. I know.

01:44:30.932 --> 01:44:32.390
Sal!

01:44:34.143 --> 01:44:36.227
- Fuck!
- (engine starts)

01:44:36.395 --> 01:44:39.773
Sal. Sal! Sal! Sal!

01:44:39.941 --> 01:44:41.191
Sal!

01:44:42.735 --> 01:44:44.277
Fuck.

01:45:08.970 --> 01:45:10.971
(lighter clicks)

01:45:35.496 --> 01:45:37.288
My man.
Red and them up there?

01:45:37.456 --> 01:45:39.165
Yeah yeah yeah,
they up there, Tang.

01:45:39.333 --> 01:45:40.667
Yo, Tang man.

01:45:40.835 --> 01:45:43.003
Y'all heard about that shit
that happened to Caz?

01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:45.880
That shit fucked up, Tang.
For real, man.

01:45:49.343 --> 01:45:51.011
What the fuck?

01:45:51.178 --> 01:45:53.263
What the fuck is this?

01:47:02.291 --> 01:47:04.334
- (engine stops)
- (van door opens)

01:47:05.419 --> 01:47:07.003
(door closes)

01:47:23.104 --> 01:47:24.729
(keys jingle)

01:47:24.897 --> 01:47:26.314
