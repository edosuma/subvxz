00:02.719 --> 00:03.937
Check this out.

00:03.961 --> 00:06.987
I signed up for this new
app where I bid for odd jobs.

00:06.989 --> 00:10.002
Yesterday a guy paid me
100 bucks to do his dishes.

00:11.460 --> 00:12.384
Dude, that's a lot of money.

00:12.409 --> 00:14.219
Right... ? It was kind of weird

00:14.244 --> 00:16.009
that I couldn't wear
my pants while I did it.

00:19.435 --> 00:21.301
But you know the saying,

00:21.303 --> 00:23.136
The customer watching
you from inside the closet

00:23.168 --> 00:24.252
"is always right"

00:27.222 --> 00:29.901
Morning, prisoners of enterprise!

00:29.926 --> 00:32.546
Morning, Lou! Got to use the bathroom?

00:32.548 --> 00:34.714
How did you know? You
have a sixth sense?

00:34.716 --> 00:36.763
No, Lou, I was tipped
off by my other five.

00:37.318 --> 00:39.552
Uh, be my guest.

00:39.554 --> 00:41.354
Hey, hey!

00:41.356 --> 00:42.355
Where do you think you're going?

00:42.357 --> 00:44.433
That bathroom is for customers only.

00:44.458 --> 00:46.092
Fine. Luckily,

00:46.117 --> 00:49.617
there are no cameras in the
Baskin-Robbins parking lot.

00:50.598 --> 00:52.062
Come on, Arthur, have a heart.

00:52.087 --> 00:53.799
Lou, wait! Hold on, buddy. Look,

00:53.801 --> 00:55.000
here's a dollar.

00:55.002 --> 00:56.501
Buy a donut.

00:56.503 --> 00:58.303
Now you're a customer.

00:58.305 --> 01:00.382
Now that I have a dollar,
I feel more like a beer

01:00.407 --> 01:02.139
than a donut. You guys sell beer?

01:03.143 --> 01:05.644
No, we don't sell beer! Get out of here!

01:06.981 --> 01:08.972
Man, that was cold.

01:08.997 --> 01:11.363
What? I don't want some
bum using my bathroom.

01:11.388 --> 01:13.120
Well, first of all, that bum has a name.

01:13.687 --> 01:14.783
It's Trashcan Lou.

01:16.517 --> 01:17.861
And I've known him my entire life.

01:17.886 --> 01:19.595
And he deserves to be
treated with some respect.

01:19.650 --> 01:22.661
Look, I'm not running a homeless
shelter here. This is a business, kid.

01:22.663 --> 01:24.830
Well, I think it's good
business to be nice to people.

01:26.834 --> 01:29.468
Oh, I'm sorry, you're serious.

01:30.397 --> 01:31.970
You know, if you weren't
always pushing people out,

01:31.972 --> 01:33.705
you'd bring a lot more people in.

01:33.707 --> 01:35.734
Mm, preach, brotha!

01:38.421 --> 01:40.913
I.. I apologize. It
was brother in my head.

01:42.171 --> 01:44.060
Now, look, kid, you got
to be tough sometimes.

01:44.085 --> 01:46.183
You can't say yes to everybody.
Otherwise, they'll walk all over you.

01:46.185 --> 01:49.120
Well, Arthur, you can't
say no all the time either.

01:49.122 --> 01:51.455
You know? It's like my
Grandma Cici used to tell me,

01:51.457 --> 01:53.190
You attract more flies with honey.

01:53.192 --> 01:55.793
And something about vinegar and bees.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.224
I don't remember. She
had this little gray beard

01:58.249 --> 02:00.347
- I was mesmerized by it.
- You know...

02:00.372 --> 02:02.385
you are so naive.

02:02.479 --> 02:03.901
I mean, it's obvious
you've never been a boss.

02:03.903 --> 02:04.902
Well, I could be a boss.

02:06.372 --> 02:07.804
Oh, I'm sorry, you're serious again.

02:07.806 --> 02:10.007
Okay.

02:10.008 --> 02:11.392
What, you don't think I'm boss material?

02:11.417 --> 02:13.544
No, it's not that. I mean,
you're a great employee.

02:13.546 --> 02:14.711
You're just a little too...

02:15.280 --> 02:17.892
Kind? Compassionate? Caring?

02:17.917 --> 02:19.850
Yeah, yeah, all that crap.

02:21.835 --> 02:24.407
Those are qualities that
would make me a good boss.

02:24.409 --> 02:25.974
You know, if you let me
run the shop just one day,

02:25.999 --> 02:27.788
- I could prove it to you.
- No, no. It's not gonna happen.

02:27.860 --> 02:28.992
Damn.

02:28.994 --> 02:32.495
Arthur, what is the harm
in giving Franco a shot?

02:32.497 --> 02:34.830
You hired him to ease
your workload, didn't you?

02:34.832 --> 02:36.832
- Yeah.
- So let him.

02:36.834 --> 02:38.768
How long's it been
since you had a day off?

02:38.770 --> 02:41.871
I don't know. I guess,
uh, when Joanie died.

02:41.873 --> 02:44.723
- That's been three years.
- Hmm.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.909
You cannot make your
whole life about work.

02:46.911 --> 02:49.318
That's why you're such
a grouch all the time.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.080
Look, I do not need a day off.

02:51.082 --> 02:52.715
And I'm not a grouch.

02:52.717 --> 02:55.196
I'm pleasant. It's
everybody else that sucks.

02:57.555 --> 02:59.421
Oh! Here we go.

03:00.154 --> 03:01.457
Let's see if they accepted my bid.

03:02.100 --> 03:03.192
Yes!

03:03.818 --> 03:07.466
Guess who's gonna get paid 200
bucks to assemble a bookshelf.

03:08.723 --> 03:09.698
Oh.

03:10.395 --> 03:13.098
Does anybody have bike
shorts and a nipple clamp?

03:15.842 --> 03:18.099
Hey, I said no! Now get out of here!

03:18.175 --> 03:19.599
Now get out!

03:20.646 --> 03:23.278
But, mister, we just want to set
up a table and sell our cookies.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.614
Hey, can you read the
sign? It says No solicitors.

03:25.616 --> 03:27.751
I don't know what a solicitor is.

03:28.462 --> 03:30.051
Now, look, you're
cutting into my business.

03:30.053 --> 03:31.519
Scram!

03:36.660 --> 03:38.893
I guess one day off couldn't hurt.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:47.770 --> 03:51.038
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.174
Don't play basketball
with the donuts, Franco.

03:53.176 --> 03:54.442
Oh, what's that?

03:54.444 --> 03:55.676
You're not here, Arthur?

03:55.678 --> 03:56.877
Then I guess I can.

03:56.879 --> 03:58.712
He shoots!

04:00.215 --> 04:01.982
He burns himself.

04:01.984 --> 04:03.517
Ah.

04:03.519 --> 04:05.352
All right, that rule makes sense now.

04:09.692 --> 04:11.558
My first customer!

04:11.560 --> 04:14.027
What a lovely establishment.

04:14.029 --> 04:16.829
You sell donuts here?

04:16.831 --> 04:19.312
Man, what are you doing? You
said this would be your day off.

04:19.337 --> 04:20.868
No, no, no, I know, and it's great.

04:21.189 --> 04:22.711
You know, I usually get
up at 4:00 in the morning,

04:22.736 --> 04:23.670
- come in here andmake donuts. 
- Mm-hmm.

04:23.672 --> 04:25.238
Today I got up at 4:00 in the morning,

04:25.240 --> 04:28.208
I sat around in the dark for
three hours, but here I am.

04:28.210 --> 04:29.909
But you said you'd leave me alone.

04:29.911 --> 04:31.377
No, I will, I will.

04:31.379 --> 04:33.312
Today I'm just a regular
customer off the street.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.613
- Hmm?
- All right.

04:34.615 --> 04:36.749
- Here.
- Thank you.

04:36.751 --> 04:38.084
Aren't you gonna charge me?

04:38.086 --> 04:39.251
It's your shop.

04:39.253 --> 04:41.453
We never give away free donuts.

04:42.973 --> 04:44.887
Fine. 89 cents, sir.

04:45.026 --> 04:47.059
- All right, all right, that's better. 
- Mm-hmm.

04:47.061 --> 04:48.506
Oh, I don't have any change.

04:48.540 --> 04:50.506
- Um, but I'm good for it, right?
- Yeah, it's...

04:50.531 --> 04:52.298
- What did I just say?!
- God.

04:53.301 --> 04:55.367
We never give away free donuts!

04:55.369 --> 04:58.904
Oh, this is gonna be such fun.

04:59.833 --> 05:00.872
- Arthur?
- Yeah.

05:00.874 --> 05:02.474
I thought you were taking the day off.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.309
Shouldn't you be at home
with your hand in your pants

05:04.311 --> 05:06.564
watching The Real
Somethings of Somewhere?

05:07.948 --> 05:09.547
He's checking up on me

05:09.549 --> 05:11.216
because he doesn't
think I'm boss material.

05:11.218 --> 05:12.818
Arthur, you don't need to do that.

05:12.820 --> 05:14.532
He definitely isn't.

05:16.523 --> 05:19.224
Why is Trashcan Lou pacing
back and forth out there?

05:19.226 --> 05:22.010
He just tried to drop a
deuce at my dry cleaners.

05:22.971 --> 05:25.049
And I don't mean spend
a two dollar bill.

05:25.239 --> 05:26.236
I love English.

05:26.330 --> 05:27.896
So many ways to say poop.

05:29.567 --> 05:31.680
This is ridiculous. I-I
got to let him in.

05:31.705 --> 05:33.104
No, no, no, I told you yesterday,

05:33.106 --> 05:34.405
he wasn't allowed in the shop.

05:34.407 --> 05:35.989
Well, there's a new sheriff in town,

05:36.014 --> 05:38.442
and I don't know anything
about Westerns, so that's it.

05:39.678 --> 05:41.746
Lou, get in here, buddy.

05:41.748 --> 05:45.502
Uh, once again I find
myself short on cash.

05:46.352 --> 05:49.627
Would you be interested
in a bag of teeth?

05:51.900 --> 05:52.992
Nah, I'm okay, man.

05:53.017 --> 05:55.058
- Don't worry about it, just go.
- Thanks, Franco.

05:55.954 --> 05:58.228
- You could take a page out of his book.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:59.831 --> 06:03.009
I'm telling you, kid, you keep
up that love thy neighbor B.S.

06:03.034 --> 06:04.501
and it's gonna bite you in the ass.

06:04.503 --> 06:06.470
Oh, well, I'm just
getting started, Arthur.

06:06.472 --> 06:09.005
Starting today, running
this place the Franco way.

06:09.007 --> 06:11.141
- W-With kindness and compassion. 
- Ugh.

06:11.143 --> 06:13.042
I'm letting anyone use the bathroom,

06:13.044 --> 06:15.178
I'm giving the day-old
donuts to the needy.

06:15.180 --> 06:17.546
This place is gonna be a
beacon in the neighborhood.

06:17.548 --> 06:18.815
A beacon?

06:18.817 --> 06:20.457
So now you're Batman?

06:22.457 --> 06:24.778
Listen, man, I can't run
the shop the way I want to

06:24.809 --> 06:26.375
with Arthur looking over my shoulder.

06:26.461 --> 06:27.956
Well, I could take him out for the day.

06:27.958 --> 06:29.659
- Really?
- Sure.

06:29.661 --> 06:31.294
Maybe he'll have some fun,

06:31.296 --> 06:32.795
realize what a burden this shop is,

06:32.797 --> 06:34.863
and then sell it to
someone who could flip it

06:34.865 --> 06:37.800
for a sizable profit
like, uh, I don't know,

06:37.802 --> 06:39.802
me?

06:39.804 --> 06:43.005
I'm just kidding, I knew it was me,
I was just... yeah, okay. Yeah...

06:44.775 --> 06:48.267
Arthur, why are you wasting your
day here? You could do anything.

06:48.822 --> 06:51.078
I don't know, I'm just not
used to taking a day off.

06:51.103 --> 06:52.314
I don't even know
what to do with myself.

06:52.316 --> 06:54.649
Well, I have got the perfect thing.

06:54.651 --> 06:56.985
My cousin, he just opened a day spa.

06:56.987 --> 07:01.055
We go, have a massage,
a steam, my treat.

07:01.057 --> 07:03.224
That, that doesn't sound so bad.

07:03.226 --> 07:04.826
Are you serious? It sounds amazing.

07:04.828 --> 07:06.394
Dude, go. Go have fun.

07:06.396 --> 07:08.330
All right, all right, what the hell?

07:08.332 --> 07:10.632
Hey, do they massage your feet, huh?

07:10.634 --> 07:12.534
I love a good foot massage.

07:12.536 --> 07:13.835
Anything you want.

07:13.837 --> 07:16.080
That poor masseuse.

07:18.279 --> 07:20.771
Touching Arthur's feet is
what they call a sad ending.

07:23.302 --> 07:25.279
Well, now that he's gone,
I can do things my way.

07:25.281 --> 07:27.139
And you're already making a difference.

07:27.164 --> 07:28.654
Look at the nice thing you did for Lou.

07:28.679 --> 07:30.384
Oh, right, Lou.

07:30.386 --> 07:33.019
Is he still in there?

07:33.045 --> 07:34.278
Yo!

07:34.815 --> 07:36.213
Lou?

07:40.563 --> 07:42.363
Hey, Lou, you okay?

07:42.365 --> 07:43.897
Why wouldn't I be?

07:43.899 --> 07:45.456
I live here now!

07:53.191 --> 07:54.324
This is nice, right?

07:54.326 --> 07:55.992
Yeah, it is.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.651
I thought we were gonna
be massaged by a woman.

08:01.833 --> 08:03.736
I didn't want to tell
you in front of her,

08:03.761 --> 08:05.064
but that was a woman.

08:07.472 --> 08:08.905
Now just relax,

08:08.907 --> 08:10.539
let the heat and the steam

08:10.541 --> 08:12.562
release the toxins from your body.

08:12.587 --> 08:15.078
It's what your people
would call a shvitz.

08:15.133 --> 08:16.123
Yeah.

08:16.610 --> 08:19.899
I don't think I can enjoy the
shvitz when I see your schvantz.

08:27.124 --> 08:29.157
Arthur, just think,
if you were to retire,

08:29.159 --> 08:31.159
you could be in here every day.

08:31.161 --> 08:33.429
Just relaxing, not a care in the world.

08:33.431 --> 08:35.030
Have you thought about it?

08:35.032 --> 08:37.899
Well, I guess I'll retire
somewhere down the road.

08:37.900 --> 08:39.510
How long do you think your road is?

08:41.738 --> 08:43.804
Retire?

08:43.807 --> 08:45.890
I don't even know how to fill one day.

08:46.140 --> 08:48.240
Arthur, baby...

08:50.113 --> 08:51.779
think about it.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.415
This could be your life every day.

08:54.417 --> 08:57.497
Come in here, you sweat with other men,

08:58.455 --> 09:00.921
maybe go to the market, you know, uh,

09:00.946 --> 09:02.946
handle some fruit you
don't intend to buy,

09:03.978 --> 09:05.626
watch the pigeons fight,

09:05.628 --> 09:07.673
and then... discotheque!

09:10.199 --> 09:11.459
How does that sound?

09:11.735 --> 09:14.232
Well, I guess the
fruit thing sounds okay.

09:15.498 --> 09:17.404
Oh, good, the platza.

09:17.406 --> 09:19.273
Pl-Platza?

09:19.275 --> 09:21.909
Take it easy on him,
it's his first time.

09:21.911 --> 09:24.345
But for me, Vlad, as always,

09:24.347 --> 09:26.313
beat me like I owe you money.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.084
Harder!

09:31.086 --> 09:32.719
- Harder!
- Hey, hey!

09:36.783 --> 09:37.877
Come on, Lou.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.111
Open the door. I just want to talk.

09:40.136 --> 09:42.805
Nope, I fell for that
one over at Starbucks.

09:44.299 --> 09:46.600
Well, maybe this will help.

09:46.602 --> 09:48.968
Introducing Superior Donuts'

09:48.970 --> 09:51.237
first gender neutral bathroom.

09:52.173 --> 09:53.806
And now it is my distinct honor

09:53.808 --> 09:55.546
to be the first person to use it.

09:57.345 --> 09:58.844
Madame.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.704
Nope.

10:06.729 --> 10:08.649
Ladies only! Men are animals!

10:10.825 --> 10:13.223
You know, I could probably
get that door open.

10:13.248 --> 10:15.137
You know what? If Lou
needs to get off the streets

10:15.162 --> 10:16.662
for a little bit, he can chill here.

10:16.664 --> 10:19.231
It's the compassionate
way, the Franco way.

10:19.233 --> 10:20.698
Speaking of which,

10:20.700 --> 10:22.567
I saved our leftover
donuts from yesterday.

10:22.569 --> 10:24.202
I figured, instead of
just throwing them out,

10:24.204 --> 10:25.703
we can give them to people in need.

10:26.345 --> 10:27.510
And I call the box

10:27.934 --> 10:30.375
Donuts for the needy, not the greedy.

10:32.346 --> 10:35.314
Oh. Hey, Randy. You look good.

10:35.316 --> 10:37.214
Yeah. Why are you so dressed up?

10:37.216 --> 10:38.950
I'm here for a coffee date.

10:38.952 --> 10:40.518
Nice! Where'd you meet him?

10:40.520 --> 10:42.939
Mm, back of my squad car.

10:43.790 --> 10:45.523
He's a criminal?

10:45.525 --> 10:49.516
No. He's a suspect... Big difference.

10:51.149 --> 10:53.230
Ah. That felt nice.

10:53.232 --> 10:56.733
You know, just one good deed
can make such a big difference.

10:57.677 --> 10:58.970
Do I smell bacon?

10:58.972 --> 11:01.911
Or am I having the
awesomest stroke of all time?

11:03.709 --> 11:05.742
No, I-I smell it, too.

11:08.547 --> 11:10.647
Lou!

11:11.450 --> 11:12.516
Lou!

11:12.518 --> 11:13.984
What's all the hubbub?

11:13.986 --> 11:15.418
What the hell, man!

11:15.420 --> 11:16.920
Are you cooking bacon?

11:16.922 --> 11:19.315
How else am I gonna make a BLT?

11:21.627 --> 11:23.961
Okay. You know what?
These things happen.

11:23.963 --> 11:26.463
Who doesn't love a good
bathroom sandwich, all right?

11:26.465 --> 11:27.930
Nothing wrong with that.

11:34.873 --> 11:36.739
Silver lining.

11:36.741 --> 11:38.781
I didn't shower today.

11:47.067 --> 11:48.933
Wow, that was a lot of water.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.207
It's okay, it's okay.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.879
This place needed a
little shower, all right?

11:51.904 --> 11:54.482
So we'll clean up, and Arthur
will never have to know.

11:55.451 --> 11:57.802
Logan, is that the
man who yelled at you?

11:57.827 --> 12:00.208
No, no, that was a
75-year-old white guy.

12:00.233 --> 12:02.784
Um... that's cool.

12:03.017 --> 12:05.250
People confuse us all the time, so...

12:05.252 --> 12:07.285
But look, uh, we're
under new management now,

12:07.287 --> 12:09.287
and I'd love to make it up to you,

12:09.289 --> 12:11.956
so, uh, how would you like
to sell your cookies in here?

12:11.958 --> 12:13.424
- Really? Thanks, mister.
- Yeah.

12:13.426 --> 12:15.418
Hey, kid. Are any of
those cookies chocolate?

12:15.420 --> 12:17.043
Well, we have chocolate chip,

12:17.068 --> 12:18.926
chocolate swirl, chocolate chunk...

12:19.020 --> 12:21.119
We get it... you got
a lot of cookies. Damn.

12:22.619 --> 12:23.988
Aw, I got to make more donuts, man.

12:23.990 --> 12:25.724
Arthur's never gonna like the Franco way

12:25.726 --> 12:27.559
if I don't sell anything.

12:28.962 --> 12:31.330
Arthur! Hey.

12:31.355 --> 12:33.309
Why aren't you at the spa, man?

12:33.334 --> 12:34.876
Did everyone refuse to touch you?

12:36.737 --> 12:39.190
- No, it just wasn't for me.
- Oh!

12:39.215 --> 12:41.039
I thought I'd come back here
and hang out with you guys, okay?

12:41.041 --> 12:43.507
Oh, well, r-remember, you
know, our deal that you'd

12:43.509 --> 12:45.215
take a day off and I would run the shop?

12:45.240 --> 12:47.029
Right, fine, fine. I'll
just grab a cup of coffee.

12:47.054 --> 12:50.114
No, no, no, no. I'll...
I'll get the coffee,

12:50.116 --> 12:51.816
you just... you just sit down

12:51.818 --> 12:53.651
and, uh, play-play with this.

12:53.653 --> 12:54.721
Oh.

12:55.076 --> 12:57.555
Wait, wait, what-what-what
am I, four years old?

13:03.463 --> 13:04.928
Okay, so, here's his coffee.

13:04.930 --> 13:07.097
You think you can get
a old man out of here?

13:07.099 --> 13:09.433
Uh, it's 4:00 in the afternoon.

13:09.435 --> 13:11.701
Maybe I'll take him to dinner.

13:16.475 --> 13:19.242
Arthur, what the hell?

13:20.246 --> 13:24.014
Ah, I guess that, uh, that
spa just wasn't for me.

13:24.016 --> 13:26.352
Just a bunch of naked,
sweaty guys in oil.

13:28.352 --> 13:29.952
Yeah, add a can of sangria,

13:29.954 --> 13:32.665
you just described my
last trip to Lake Havasu.

13:34.259 --> 13:36.793
I don't know what to do with myself.

13:36.795 --> 13:39.328
Guess I'm just not a
day-off kind of guy.

13:39.330 --> 13:43.109
Oh, no, this is pathetic.

13:43.134 --> 13:45.154
You have to have some fun today.

13:45.669 --> 13:47.103
Didn't you and Joanie

13:47.105 --> 13:48.489
used to go bowling?

13:48.514 --> 13:51.573
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah,
we were in a league, yeah.

13:51.575 --> 13:53.542
We called ourselves the Rolling Pins.

13:55.479 --> 13:58.247
Lost the championship to Those Douches.

13:58.249 --> 14:00.015
- A feminine hygiene company. 
- Uh-huh.

14:00.017 --> 14:01.983
Yeah.

14:01.985 --> 14:04.085
Uh, well,

14:04.087 --> 14:06.388
why don't the two of us go bowling?

14:06.390 --> 14:07.989
Really?

14:07.991 --> 14:09.958
That's not exactly bowling attire.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.261
Yeah, well, I had a
date, but I'll cancel.

14:13.263 --> 14:14.830
Never would have worked, anyway.

14:14.832 --> 14:17.687
I'm a Gemini, he's an arsonist.

14:20.904 --> 14:22.671
Hey, look, thanks for
helping so much, y'all.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.499
All right, I'm gonna check
on the needy/greedy table.

14:36.853 --> 14:39.253
Ooh-ooh!

14:41.658 --> 14:44.746
Well, congratulations.
You want a cookie?

14:44.771 --> 14:46.535
Sure, if it's vegan.

14:50.833 --> 14:52.770
What the hell happened
to this place, huh?

14:52.795 --> 14:56.219
Hipsters, fancy beer, neon balls.

14:56.244 --> 14:58.205
Arthur, what is wrong?

14:58.230 --> 14:59.671
I thought you liked bowling.

14:59.673 --> 15:01.016
No, it's so different, you know?

15:01.041 --> 15:02.090
When I came here with Joanie, I mean,

15:02.115 --> 15:03.603
we didn't care about bowling.

15:03.628 --> 15:05.846
It was great... we just
had a couple of beers

15:05.848 --> 15:07.192
and made fun of the other bowlers.

15:08.249 --> 15:09.916
I remember one time we were bowling

15:09.918 --> 15:11.106
next to this church group,

15:11.131 --> 15:12.519
and Joanie... she was so cute...

15:12.521 --> 15:14.887
She just walked up
and said, Hail, Satan!

15:15.699 --> 15:18.433
We had a couple of lanes all to
ourselves the rest of the night.

15:20.796 --> 15:23.479
So is that why you
haven't taken any days off?

15:23.542 --> 15:24.763
Huh?

15:24.765 --> 15:27.367
'Cause you don't have
Joanie to hang out with?

15:27.369 --> 15:29.202
You know, when I'm at
the shop, it's okay.

15:29.204 --> 15:31.237
I mean, I'm busy, I like it.

15:31.239 --> 15:33.406
But today, with all that time off,

15:33.408 --> 15:35.541
I mean, I... I really felt her

15:35.543 --> 15:36.909
- not being here.
- Mm.

15:38.246 --> 15:40.613
Yeah, I know you miss her.

15:40.615 --> 15:43.115
I do, too.

15:43.117 --> 15:45.451
But you've got to be open
to starting a new chapter.

15:45.476 --> 15:46.505
Yeah.

15:50.663 --> 15:53.692
Maybe all you need is
a little jump-start.

15:53.694 --> 15:56.076
- Jump-start?
- Mm-hmm.

15:58.498 --> 16:00.685
Hey, bearded lady...

16:05.066 --> 16:06.971
... what's in the vape pen?

16:06.973 --> 16:09.074
Tobacco.

16:09.076 --> 16:12.076
Seriously? You're
wearing a Rasta beanie,

16:12.078 --> 16:14.282
and you smell like
day three of Coachella.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.267
Hand it over.

16:16.292 --> 16:18.016
No. Uh-huh.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.250
I'm a cop.

16:19.252 --> 16:20.670
Okay.

16:23.590 --> 16:26.490
Now, I'm gonna go get
myself a cheeseburger.

16:26.492 --> 16:28.629
You make sure this doesn't
fall into the wrong hands.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.418
Yeah, I got it.

16:31.184 --> 16:33.942
Ooh...

16:34.004 --> 16:35.887
Hey, get me a cheeseburger, too, huh?

16:37.836 --> 16:39.183
And one of everything else.

16:42.908 --> 16:45.042
- Here you go, Tush.
- Thank you.

16:46.879 --> 16:49.846
Oh, boy, I recognize that sound.

16:49.848 --> 16:51.848
Those raccoons must have
gone up the drainpipe

16:51.850 --> 16:53.249
and into your ceiling.

16:55.054 --> 16:57.387
Wait!

16:57.745 --> 16:59.089
I'll handle it.

16:59.992 --> 17:02.245
Those raccoons may run the streets,

17:02.270 --> 17:04.594
but you go up into a crawlspace,

17:04.596 --> 17:07.196
that's my natural habitat.

17:07.199 --> 17:10.570
Damn, this day's been a disaster.

17:10.596 --> 17:12.531
I've ruined more donuts than I've sold,

17:12.557 --> 17:14.404
and I'll be lucky if we break even.

17:14.429 --> 17:16.160
Maybe it's just one of those
days where people aren't

17:16.185 --> 17:18.373
- in the mood for something sweet.
- Yeah.

17:18.397 --> 17:22.380
98, 99... Yes! 300!

17:23.047 --> 17:26.415
Yes! 300!

17:27.218 --> 17:29.827
I'm sorry, Logan. I'm having a bad day.

17:30.121 --> 17:32.429
Not anymore, here comes
two more customers.

17:32.454 --> 17:34.656
Okay. Welcome to Superior Donuts.

17:34.658 --> 17:35.583
What can I get you?

17:35.608 --> 17:37.526
Oh, we're just here to see our friend.

17:37.528 --> 17:39.263
He's having a housewarming party.

17:39.863 --> 17:44.466
Fred, Doris. Let me take your coats.

17:46.937 --> 17:49.037
Arthur, perfect.

17:49.039 --> 17:51.239
Hey, look, man, before you say anything,

17:51.241 --> 17:53.207
you were right.

17:53.209 --> 17:54.310
I was nice to people,

17:54.335 --> 17:55.989
and now we got a bum in the bathroom,

17:56.014 --> 17:57.505
and we got raccoons in the ceiling.

17:57.530 --> 17:59.114
And someone stole my take-a-penny,

17:59.116 --> 18:00.693
leave-a-penny dish.

18:00.951 --> 18:02.751
You win.

18:03.851 --> 18:07.188
You are so freakin' cute.

18:07.190 --> 18:09.357
Oh.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.719
- Arthur, are you high?
- No. Well, a little.

18:15.064 --> 18:18.429
If anyone asks, he has
restless-leg glaucoma.

18:20.547 --> 18:22.647
Well, Randy and I had
the best day, yeah.

18:22.672 --> 18:24.022
- Oh.
- We went to the Field Museum,

18:24.047 --> 18:25.976
saw a movie. We had deep-dish pizza.

18:26.001 --> 18:28.148
Wherever we went, Oprah was there.

18:28.978 --> 18:31.569
Definitely not Oprah.

18:31.779 --> 18:34.081
- Lots of apologies.
- Oh.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.654
Well, you know what, I'm-I'm
glad someone had a good day.

18:36.679 --> 18:38.886
Oh, hey, come on, don't be
so hard on yourself, kid.

18:38.888 --> 18:40.753
Oh, it's actually
great how much you care.

18:40.755 --> 18:44.643
You're a leave-a-penny guy
in a take-a-penny world.

18:44.668 --> 18:46.359
You do not know what you're saying, man.

18:46.361 --> 18:48.595
- You are blazed.
- Hey, come on, kid, no,

18:48.597 --> 18:50.830
we'd be a great team
together, don't you think, huh?

18:50.832 --> 18:53.221
I'm the brains, you're the heart.

18:54.336 --> 18:56.102
Thanks so much.

18:56.104 --> 18:58.526
There are not a lot of places
that would let her do this.

18:58.551 --> 19:00.885
- Anytime.
- Hey, my company does this big

19:00.910 --> 19:02.441
breakfast meeting every week.

19:02.443 --> 19:04.169
Could you handle a standing order

19:04.194 --> 19:05.578
of ten dozen donuts a week?

19:05.580 --> 19:06.732
Hmm?

19:08.116 --> 19:11.184
Yeah, we... yes. Hell yeah, absolutely.

19:11.186 --> 19:12.551
Thanks very much.

19:12.553 --> 19:16.121
- Thank you.
- Well, kid,

19:16.123 --> 19:17.456
I guess there must be something

19:17.458 --> 19:19.124
to the Franco way, huh?

19:19.126 --> 19:22.392
Yeah, but every now and then,

19:22.417 --> 19:24.162
you need a little bit
of the Arthur way, too.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.338
Excuse me.

19:25.363 --> 19:28.098
Lou! You took advantage of me, man!

19:28.135 --> 19:29.517
That stops right now!

19:29.542 --> 19:30.736
I got a cop outside.

19:30.761 --> 19:32.759
If you don't come out in 30 seconds,

19:32.784 --> 19:34.272
she's coming in after you.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.741
Geez, Franco,

19:35.743 --> 19:38.243
you don't have to be such a hard-ass.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.644
What did you do to him?

19:41.882 --> 19:44.453
I will send for my things.

19:46.445 --> 19:47.945
You see that, kid?

19:47.970 --> 19:49.203
You should give yourself some credit.

19:49.228 --> 19:50.632
You know what you're doing.

19:51.406 --> 19:53.424
Yeah, I guess I do.

19:57.996 --> 20:00.878
I'm okay, this pipe broke my fall.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.518
And my hopes of ever having children.

20:04.628 --> 20:06.182
You all saw that, right?

20:06.207 --> 20:09.006
- Uh, no, uh-uh.
- We did not.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.041
You know, Arthur, we
should get you home.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.044
Man, I am so lit!

20:19.656 --> 20:21.824
Morning.

20:23.060 --> 20:25.305
I'll have a cold towel and a hot tea.

20:25.330 --> 20:28.460
Uh-huh. You still feeling it, Arthur?

20:28.485 --> 20:30.886

20:30.888 --> 20:33.989
But all in all, I think I

20:44.951 --> 20:46.849
Please tell me you got that on camera.

20:47.021 --> 20:48.469
Oh, I would never do that.

20:48.471 --> 20:49.882
Check your e-mail.
