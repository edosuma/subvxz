00:57.033 --> 00:58.174
Anne.

00:59.900 --> 01:01.953
Anne, come on, look at me.

01:02.533 --> 01:04.387
Look at me!

01:07.767 --> 01:11.654
Everything is gonna be okay, okay?

01:14.300 --> 01:16.262
Can you move your wrists?

01:22.400 --> 01:25.659
I'm here, okay? I promise you, I'm here.

01:26.239 --> 01:28.054
I'm here.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.727
Daddy.

01:43.733 --> 01:45.287
Please.

01:46.367 --> 01:49.254
Please, I'm begging you!

01:49.700 --> 01:51.754
Please forgive me.

01:52.900 --> 01:55.754
Please, please just let us go.

01:57.600 --> 02:00.454
Please, I'm begging you!

02:02.000 --> 02:06.021
Please, please forgive me, let me go!

02:13.033 --> 02:14.557
Please.

02:15.453 --> 02:18.620
Please, I promise you, we won't tell anyone.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.953
We won't tell anyone, I promise.

02:21.033 --> 02:22.420
We won't tell anyone!

02:22.500 --> 02:24.787
Has mommy said what she's been up to?

02:25.167 --> 02:28.120
Connor! Connor! Connor, no!

02:28.200 --> 02:30.287
Please, Connor!

02:37.000 --> 02:40.569
No! No, no! Don't you touch her!

02:40.649 --> 02:43.920
Don't you touch my baby! Don't you touch her.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.429
Why don't you tell her what you've done?

02:46.893 --> 02:48.421
Slut!

02:49.800 --> 02:53.090
Holy shit! Oh, my God, no!

03:38.253 --> 03:39.787
Why?

03:39.967 --> 03:42.054
You had fun, didn't you?

03:43.367 --> 03:45.787
- Yeah, I guess.
- My head is pounding.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.453
Gina, stop.

03:48.533 --> 03:51.887
- Do you guys want anything?
- Yes! Champagne.

03:51.967 --> 03:55.633
The wedding party starts now, Mrs. Braithway!

03:55.713 --> 03:59.243
You know, if I bloat and I don't fit
into that dress, this is on you.

03:59.323 --> 04:03.153
That is completely true. You know, I do
think you'll put on about ten pounds...

04:03.233 --> 04:06.287
- ...so how about I have your glass?
- Fuck off.

04:07.867 --> 04:10.153
Hey, is Lisa okay?

04:10.233 --> 04:13.060
Well, she might be a little better
if she wasn't paying for the gas?

04:13.140 --> 04:15.141
Shit, yeah.

04:15.221 --> 04:17.019
Run!

04:17.100 --> 04:19.014
She's so funny.

04:19.567 --> 04:21.987
And number one please.

04:22.867 --> 04:26.320
- 40 pounds, 20 P.
- That's right.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.621
Hey. Lisa.

04:29.267 --> 04:32.920
- Hey, I've got this.
- No, it's fine. It's your wedding present.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.056
Don't say I didn't get you anything.
Thank you.

04:35.136 --> 04:38.987
- Okay, look, is this because you think...
- It's fine. I don't wanna talk about it.

04:53.133 --> 04:54.721
Hey.

05:02.033 --> 05:04.720
Come on, come on, come on!

05:14.367 --> 05:17.214
No, fuck. No, no, no, no.

05:17.667 --> 05:20.287
Uh, hey, do you need gas?

05:25.700 --> 05:27.554
Thank you.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.987
No.

05:44.867 --> 05:49.220
You can't do that, that's wrong.
Did you see that creep in there?

05:49.300 --> 05:51.853
Yes, you've got to stop
being nice to these people.

05:51.933 --> 05:54.387
I did something nice,
then it turned into being perved on.

05:54.467 --> 05:57.920
- Well, you're asking for it.
- We're gonna be late, come on!

05:59.900 --> 06:01.487
Ladies.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.684
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

06:07.550 --> 06:09.387
All right.

06:09.867 --> 06:11.680
Yeah, I know you can.

06:11.760 --> 06:14.053
Hey, that's the guy.

06:14.133 --> 06:16.354
What the hell?

06:19.933 --> 06:22.587
Keep your eyes to yourself, creep.

07:07.567 --> 07:10.820
So it's been a while since you and your
sister have seen each other, huh?

07:10.900 --> 07:12.634
Stupid question.

07:13.767 --> 07:17.753
- You've not spoken much?
- She hardly called.

07:17.833 --> 07:21.597
Don't make it too obvious that you
don't wanna be here, okay, buddy?

07:21.677 --> 07:25.082
- I'm fine.
- You're not excited to be maid of honor?

07:27.400 --> 07:29.401
She hasn't asked.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.520
Here we go.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.654
Thanks!

07:35.800 --> 07:38.620
- How are we doing for gas?
- Oh, yeah, fine.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.387
It doesn't take much
for this car to pack in though.

07:41.467 --> 07:43.343
It would be helpful
if all the pubs had Wi-Fi.

07:43.423 --> 07:47.063
Okay, here. Welcome to the countryside.

07:48.333 --> 07:50.387
I hate the countryside.

07:56.733 --> 07:58.420
Hey, you.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.887
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

08:01.667 --> 08:05.121
Yeah, it's good. How's it looking there?

08:15.700 --> 08:17.721
I can't wait to see you.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.187
Yeah.

08:26.733 --> 08:29.787
Uh, shit, I've gotta go.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.953
Yeah, okay.

08:39.799 --> 08:42.886
Uh, love you too, bye.

08:47.833 --> 08:50.553
- Is that the creep from the gas station?
- Yeah.

08:50.633 --> 08:51.781
What?

08:53.467 --> 08:57.177
Hey, hey, creep,
are you getting a good look, are you?

08:58.367 --> 08:59.807
Freak.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.713
Leave it.

09:01.967 --> 09:05.754
Fucking country freaks.

09:16.100 --> 09:18.337
God, it's creepy around here, isn't it?

09:18.417 --> 09:22.021
- Really?
- Hmm, yeah, it's creepy.

09:23.633 --> 09:25.454
No, it's not.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.587
Right, so if we take the path here.

09:28.667 --> 09:31.053
- Yeah.
- We should get on the right track.

09:31.133 --> 09:33.984
Is there anywhere
we can chop off a few hours?

09:38.167 --> 09:40.553
We could try the back roads?

09:40.633 --> 09:41.987
- Great.
- Oh, you.

09:42.067 --> 09:46.721
Come on, Melissa, if we don't hurry,
Brandon might marry someone else.

09:48.167 --> 09:50.620
Hey, like me, baby.

09:50.700 --> 09:54.220
- Oh, my God.
- All right, let's go.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.254
She's pretty.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.783
Wait, what, what is that?

10:26.033 --> 10:28.953
Oh, my God, is that the guy
from the gas station?

10:29.033 --> 10:30.837
That's his fucking car.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.387
What are we gonna fucking do?

10:34.767 --> 10:36.853
Oh, fuck this shit!

10:37.533 --> 10:38.987
What?

10:39.067 --> 10:40.887
Oh, my God.

10:43.055 --> 10:45.607
Hey! Hey, weirdo!

10:45.697 --> 10:47.976
Are you gonna move your car or what?

10:52.500 --> 10:54.354
Shut up.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.453
I said move your fucking car.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.787
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my God!

11:19.700 --> 11:22.571
You! Get out now!

11:24.833 --> 11:26.853
I said get out the fucking car!

11:28.033 --> 11:30.047
- Get back in.
- Okay, okay.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.093
Get in the car now.

11:33.173 --> 11:37.187
- Hey, creep, leave her alone!
- Get in the car! I said, get in the car!

11:42.667 --> 11:45.347
- Getting married, huh?
- What.. what are...

11:45.427 --> 11:47.783
What are you... what are you doing?

11:49.967 --> 11:50.953
On the floor.

11:51.033 --> 11:54.487
I don't know what you think is going on
here but I was trying to help you earlier.

11:59.733 --> 12:01.987
Don't you fucking play me!

12:03.833 --> 12:07.407
Stay away from the car.
On the floor, over there now!

12:07.487 --> 12:09.554
Stay away from the car.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.858
It's not what you said...

12:15.938 --> 12:17.853
- ...it's what you did.
- I'm sorry!

12:17.933 --> 12:20.820
You looked at me earlier
like I was scum on your shoe.

12:21.660 --> 12:24.287
I am so sorry.

12:25.633 --> 12:29.024
If we met differently,
you could have been marrying me.

12:35.833 --> 12:39.153
I'm gonna teach you all a lesson!

12:43.467 --> 12:45.353
Wait here.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.739
Gina, where are you going?

12:53.100 --> 12:55.521
How are you doing? Okay?

12:59.767 --> 13:01.707
Lisa, what did you do?

13:05.033 --> 13:08.821
- Is he okay?
- I fucking hope not.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.640
- He's not breathing.
- We need to call the cops.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.787
- Oh, my God, they're gonna take me away!
- No, they're not. It wasn't your fault.

13:15.867 --> 13:17.753
Come on.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.820
No, no! Give me that, gimme that.

13:19.900 --> 13:24.887
What? No, we need to call the cops.
We need to tell them what happened.

13:24.967 --> 13:29.053
- If we just leave it, it'll get worse!
- No, no! It wasn't our fault, okay?

13:29.133 --> 13:31.590
Yes, but if we leave his body,
then no one will believe us.

13:31.670 --> 13:33.880
Thalia! Would you rather it be him
on the ground or you...

13:33.960 --> 13:38.437
- ...because I'd much rather it be him.
- Then what the hell do we do?

13:48.467 --> 13:50.354
We shouldn't be doing this.

13:52.733 --> 13:55.523
We need to get as far away
from here as we can.

14:33.933 --> 14:37.453
Fuck. We're running out of fucking gas.

14:37.633 --> 14:39.753
- Shit.
- Now do we call the cops?

14:39.833 --> 14:43.620
Oh, yeah. Oh, hi, officer,
fucking can you help us?

14:43.700 --> 14:47.053
We're going to a wedding. We have
a fucking dead body in our trunk.

14:47.133 --> 14:49.821
Okay, no fucking signal anyway!

14:52.600 --> 14:56.006
No, babe, but seriously if you have
any other suggestions, I'm all ears.

14:58.467 --> 15:01.417
Guys, there's a house.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.160
- I don't know.
- No, no, it's a good idea.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.212
Okay, we're lost, we have
no idea where we're going.

15:10.292 --> 15:13.320
So at least somebody might be
able to give us directions.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.187
Okay.

15:38.767 --> 15:42.238
This isn't exactly a fucking spa day, is it?

15:43.367 --> 15:46.741
No, come on, come on.

15:46.833 --> 15:48.854
Okay, we'll be on our way again soon.

15:52.433 --> 15:56.004
Okay, what we need to do is we
need to find out where we are..

15:56.684 --> 15:58.721
...we need to get some gas...

15:58.833 --> 16:01.720
...get... we need to get rid of the body...

16:01.800 --> 16:06.183
...clean ourselves up, get to the
wedding and we can say that we...

16:06.263 --> 16:09.353
...that we got stuck in,
traffic or something.

16:09.433 --> 16:11.920
Yeah, yeah. Exactly.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.020
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

16:15.600 --> 16:19.520
Right, come on, guys, we need
to pull ourselves together. Okay?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.487
All of us.

16:22.333 --> 16:23.921
Okay.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.487
Come on, let's go in.

17:10.067 --> 17:11.958
I don't think anyone's here.

17:26.767 --> 17:28.354
Hello?

17:54.000 --> 17:57.387
Oh, oh, I'm so... I'm so sorry.

17:57.467 --> 18:00.487
- Hello, dears.
- We're... we're lost.

18:00.567 --> 18:03.053
I shan't imagine you'd be here otherwise.

18:03.133 --> 18:06.587
Well, we're running low on gas. Can you help?

18:07.067 --> 18:08.787
Do I look like a petrol station?

18:10.367 --> 18:12.820
We were hoping you could
point us in the right direction.

18:12.900 --> 18:15.420
Well, there's nothing around
here for miles and miles.

18:15.500 --> 18:19.902
I mean, I'd offer you a telephone but,
you see, I don't have anyone to ring. So...

18:22.167 --> 18:24.307
Well, I may know someone who can help.

18:30.533 --> 18:32.420
Are you ladies coming in?

18:34.433 --> 18:36.287
Yeah, yeah.

18:42.167 --> 18:44.420
The gardener comes on Wednesday.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.420
I don't have many guests,
but if you girls wish to stay then...

18:47.500 --> 18:50.704
...I'm sure he can sort some petrol
and get you on your way then.

18:55.140 --> 18:57.520
Oh, how rude of me.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.054
My name is Miss Perkins.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.503
I have very strict rules.

19:06.033 --> 19:09.553
You see, I'm not used to visitors
having always lived here alone.

19:09.633 --> 19:11.920
I like my routines.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.541
Dinner is served at six
and lights are out at eight.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.220
So, where are you all heading?

19:39.600 --> 19:43.487
Oh, Melissa is getting married.

19:44.367 --> 19:46.548
- Married?
- Yeah.

19:47.067 --> 19:49.051
How sweet.

19:49.133 --> 19:51.820
Have you ever been married, Miss Perkins?

19:51.900 --> 19:53.687
Me?

19:53.767 --> 19:55.431
No.

19:55.511 --> 19:58.320
Marriage doesn't mean
very much in my opinion.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.524
A romantic fiction...

20:02.967 --> 20:05.587
...but, what do I know?

20:06.033 --> 20:09.853
I'm just an old lady,
living in the middle of nowhere...

20:10.433 --> 20:12.642
...no one to save me, and...

20:13.386 --> 20:15.073
...no one to let me down.

20:16.417 --> 20:19.098
I take pleasure in the finer things.

20:22.200 --> 20:26.654
Reading, cooking, farming, hunting.

20:29.100 --> 20:33.821
You see, it is possible to live
without the need of another.

20:37.050 --> 20:39.520
Well, this looks yummy.

20:39.600 --> 20:43.477
- Yeah, thank you so much.
- I do what I can.

20:48.467 --> 20:50.987
I hope your stay is equally to your liking.

20:51.667 --> 20:55.925
Respect my rules
and I'll respect you girls' space.

21:00.167 --> 21:03.053
She seems a little odd.

21:03.433 --> 21:05.720
Yeah, well, she seems nice
enough to let us stay.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.620
- It doesn't mean she's a nice person.
- It will be fine.

21:08.700 --> 21:12.087
Hey, look, I've been thinking,
I don't think we need to keep driving.

21:12.167 --> 21:14.187
I think we're deep enough.

21:14.267 --> 21:18.187
You know, if we can't get the car
fixed before Wednesday...

21:19.167 --> 21:21.887
...if we get the chance we need to get
the body and get it in the woods here.

21:21.967 --> 21:24.020
- Bury it here.
- Here?

21:24.100 --> 21:27.620
- Well, this place isn't even on the map.
- Exactly, and then we'll be back en route.

21:27.700 --> 21:30.587
On Wednesday morning
we can get to the wedding...

21:30.667 --> 21:32.753
...without anyone knowing anything.

21:32.833 --> 21:36.287
- Where?
- I don't know, in the woods?

21:37.067 --> 21:40.553
Do we have to, like,
you know, cut up the body?

21:40.633 --> 21:43.120
- Gina!
- Fuck, Gina?

21:43.200 --> 21:46.053
- This isn't fucking Dexter.
- I don't know.

21:46.333 --> 21:49.153
You reckon we could sneak out
without her noticing?

21:49.733 --> 21:51.269
Shit.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.487
Lights out in five, girls.

23:47.967 --> 23:49.821
I said lights out.

24:18.700 --> 24:20.287
Fuck.

24:21.433 --> 24:23.721
Oh, God.

24:24.267 --> 24:28.753
I really need to call Brandon. We were
supposed to arrive hours ago, you know?

24:29.233 --> 24:31.321
What will his parents be thinking?

24:37.233 --> 24:39.321
What would Mom and Dad think?

24:41.567 --> 24:44.433
Well, you don't need
to worry about that, do you?

24:54.633 --> 24:58.087
Look, Lisa, I was wondering.

25:01.867 --> 25:04.308
I was hoping you would be my Maid of Honor.

25:08.333 --> 25:11.987
- Took you long enough.
- It's just that, you know, me and Brandon...

25:12.067 --> 25:13.666
Yeah...

25:14.345 --> 25:16.147
...it's fine.

25:18.333 --> 25:19.721
Course.

25:25.967 --> 25:28.847
- So I was thinking...
- Night, Mel.

26:03.733 --> 26:06.553
I thought I said
you were sleeping on the floor.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.053
Well, my back was hurting.

26:09.133 --> 26:12.154
Fine, but don't get any ideas.

26:24.983 --> 26:26.784
Stop being a creeper.

26:34.100 --> 26:35.954
I said stop.

26:44.433 --> 26:46.720
I thought last time was a one off.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.064
Yeah, it was...

26:50.220 --> 26:52.301
...just like the time before that.

27:07.767 --> 27:11.821
You wanna do this here, in this creepy house?

27:14.267 --> 27:15.854
Yeah.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.221
Yeah.

27:20.667 --> 27:22.521
All I want is you.

28:18.428 --> 28:20.287
Are they?

28:21.035 --> 28:22.893
Are they?

28:24.973 --> 28:27.397
Oh, my God, I didn't think they were.

28:28.910 --> 28:33.384
I think Gina likes her a little more.
You can't say anything, okay?

28:37.586 --> 28:40.008
Do you think Miss Perkins will hear?

28:40.088 --> 28:42.205
Oh, I really hope not.

28:43.124 --> 28:45.374
She might think it's us.

28:52.100 --> 28:53.955
That'll be you in two days time.

28:54.035 --> 28:56.260
Well, I prefer it be with my husband.

29:04.779 --> 29:06.602
What's that?

29:13.287 --> 29:15.152
I hope it's not Miss Perkins.

29:43.818 --> 29:46.407
- There's someone in the shed.
- What?

29:46.487 --> 29:48.376
In the shed.

29:50.909 --> 29:53.142
There's someone in the shed.

30:05.173 --> 30:06.762
Hurry.

30:16.918 --> 30:19.741
I don't like them here.

30:19.821 --> 30:22.276
Whores. Sluts.

30:22.357 --> 30:25.480
They're only here for one more night.
Then they'll be gone.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.682
I saw them.

30:27.762 --> 30:31.943
I saw them all strutting around
my house dressed like whores.

30:32.023 --> 30:35.977
The four of them, they are disgusting
sluts and I want them gone.

30:36.057 --> 30:39.127
Please be calm, oh, please.

30:39.207 --> 30:42.431
Look, I will sort this tomorrow,
I promise you.

30:42.511 --> 30:46.568
I said I don't like them,
I don't like them being here, you hear?

30:46.648 --> 30:51.673
I want them gone! Get out! Get out now!

30:52.587 --> 30:54.925
- Let's get back inside!
- Let's go, let's go!

30:59.127 --> 31:01.016
What the fuck?

31:01.896 --> 31:03.752
That was fucked up.

31:04.032 --> 31:06.255
I don't like them being here?

31:06.735 --> 31:08.723
I thought she said she lived alone?

31:08.803 --> 31:10.224
Okay, guys, I know that was weird...

31:10.304 --> 31:14.005
...but maybe it was just some
crazy asshole or something.

31:15.243 --> 31:18.332
Something about his tone, that wasn't normal.

31:18.413 --> 31:20.303
I know, I know.

31:21.149 --> 31:24.839
Look, I don't know,
I mean, we've had a shitty day.

31:24.919 --> 31:28.460
We've got one day after today.
Let's just go to bed.

31:40.218 --> 31:42.040
No, Mel's right.

31:42.421 --> 31:45.512
We had a really hard day today.
We're probably just tired.

31:47.726 --> 31:49.481
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:49.561 --> 31:51.984
Let's go to bed. It'll be fine.

31:52.431 --> 31:55.488
- It's probably nothing, like nothing.
- Yeah.

31:56.935 --> 31:58.524
Okay.

31:59.270 --> 32:01.160
Good night.

32:02.407 --> 32:04.223
Good night, girls.

32:12.328 --> 32:14.139
Good night.

33:00.832 --> 33:02.723
Breakfast, girls!

33:09.674 --> 33:12.027
Oh, morning.

33:12.477 --> 33:15.166
Toast and honey, good for the spirit.

33:15.246 --> 33:18.840
I do apologize. You know,
there's not a lot to do around here.

33:18.920 --> 33:22.741
Um, I mean, I have all sorts
of books and, well, more books...

33:22.821 --> 33:25.326
...and, um...

33:25.406 --> 33:28.312
...I mean you can enjoy the weather...

33:28.392 --> 33:30.915
...but I would stay away from the woods.

33:30.995 --> 33:32.651
They are quite the maze.

33:32.731 --> 33:36.190
Easy to get lost and hard
to find your way back.

33:42.472 --> 33:46.076
- Thank you, this looks amazing.
- Yes, thank you.

33:56.054 --> 33:59.344
Okay. Go, go, go.

34:02.260 --> 34:07.018
Okay, we need to start digging, okay.
We need to find a shovel or something.

34:07.098 --> 34:09.286
Did you not just hear what she
just said in there about the woods?

34:09.368 --> 34:12.824
Oh, come on. Have you got any better ideas?

34:13.505 --> 34:15.527
Look, if she doesn't see us leave,
what does it matter?

34:15.607 --> 34:18.630
- Guys, I don't know if I can do this.
- It's okay, you don't have to.

34:18.710 --> 34:21.032
I'm sorry, I just don't think
I can deal with the body.

34:21.112 --> 34:23.167
It's fine, you don't have to.

34:23.447 --> 34:26.061
Right, well, we need to find
a spade or something.

34:28.487 --> 34:31.876
- We could look in the shed.
- What? We're not going in the fucking shed.

34:31.956 --> 34:33.844
What if someone's in there?

34:34.225 --> 34:36.715
- Thalia?
- We could knock.

34:36.795 --> 34:39.684
No fucking shed!
No, we have to find something else.

34:39.764 --> 34:41.606
Now I kinda wanna look in the shed.

34:47.739 --> 34:50.980
If one does not hunt, one does not eat.

34:52.543 --> 34:57.402
Um, Miss Perkins, maybe you could
give us a tour of the woods.

34:58.149 --> 35:01.840
I hunt alone.
I always have and I always will.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.438
- I'm set in my ways, Tina.
- It's Gina.

35:06.324 --> 35:08.614
Yes, well, catch you soon.

35:12.631 --> 35:15.787
- Okay, we are not going into the woods.
- Oh, come on.

35:15.867 --> 35:20.894
Oh, yeah, hi, Miss Perkins, here we are
in the woods with a fucking dead body!

35:22.907 --> 35:26.264
Okay, you guys, get a spade,
I'm gonna check on Lisa.

35:26.344 --> 35:27.933
Yeah.

35:31.816 --> 35:33.621
Come on.

35:51.786 --> 35:54.215
I guess this is as bad a place as any.

35:55.073 --> 35:56.929
The worst.

36:09.454 --> 36:12.510
Lisa, you okay?

36:14.158 --> 36:17.148
Either Miss Perkins
really likes picture frames...

36:17.228 --> 36:20.451
...or there's something
she's trying to hide or forget.

36:20.531 --> 36:23.389
Okay, well, I think we just
need to give her her space.

36:25.470 --> 36:27.759
Why have all the frames?

36:28.439 --> 36:31.865
I don't know. She said she doesn't have
visitors. Maybe she just doesn't care.

36:35.446 --> 36:38.290
Come on, why don't we catch up outside?
We haven't caught up in ages.

36:38.370 --> 36:40.510
Yeah, and who's fault is that?

36:44.255 --> 36:47.512
Tell me what you've been doing,
how's your singing going?

36:47.592 --> 36:49.816
I haven't sang since I was 14.

36:54.966 --> 36:58.729
Lisa, don't go in there.
That's Miss Perkins' room.

37:33.438 --> 37:35.027
Lisa!

37:49.954 --> 37:54.013
It's not very organized for someone
who likes their routines.

37:54.909 --> 37:58.930
Yeah, well, she doesn't have visitors,
so... and especially not in here.

38:23.965 --> 38:25.811
What's that?

38:56.287 --> 38:58.355
"1987...

38:59.399 --> 39:04.034
"...36-year-old man Connor Perkins
is missing after a...

39:04.714 --> 39:07.719
"...double murder in his family home.

39:10.935 --> 39:14.335
"Mr. Perkins is suspected of murdering
both his wife, Susan Perkins...

39:14.415 --> 39:16.094
"...and her mother, Chris Morrey...

39:16.174 --> 39:18.763
"...after the police found them
in the shed together...

39:18.843 --> 39:21.536
"...with blunt trauma to the head.

39:21.846 --> 39:26.491
"His daughter is also in critical care
and remains in Bamshire Hospital.

39:27.452 --> 39:30.906
"Connor Perkins is believed to have called
the police prior to his escape...

39:30.986 --> 39:32.879
"...remains at large."

39:36.645 --> 39:38.861
Miss Perkins lost her parents too.

39:39.998 --> 39:42.654
Do you think that's who's in the shed?

39:42.734 --> 39:44.122
Connor?

39:50.008 --> 39:53.699
I hope we get to shower
before the wedding tomorrow.

39:54.979 --> 39:59.605
Grave digging followed by a car
journey with you guys is just... ugh.

39:59.951 --> 40:01.540
Yeah.

40:06.224 --> 40:08.484
Feels weird, doesn't it?

40:09.461 --> 40:11.286
Talking about a wedding now.

40:11.896 --> 40:13.719
It's fucked.

40:15.267 --> 40:18.354
I guess it's good to talk
about other things though.

40:18.803 --> 40:20.695
I think it's you that's talking.

40:26.344 --> 40:29.751
Hey, how's your catch?

40:30.281 --> 40:32.140
I am a catch.

40:34.619 --> 40:37.932
So you're gonna leave me
to go and catch the bouquet?

40:43.194 --> 40:44.750
I'm kidding.

40:49.133 --> 40:50.909
Look, Gina.

40:52.337 --> 40:55.694
I just... I like you. I...

40:56.074 --> 40:57.867
You can be honest.

41:00.411 --> 41:02.553
I just don't know what I want...

41:02.913 --> 41:04.414
...okay?

41:06.284 --> 41:08.253
You got a funny way of showing it.

41:09.187 --> 41:11.042
Let's get married, Gina.

41:11.122 --> 41:14.512
I'm so excited by the idea of marriage...

41:14.593 --> 41:17.048
...and the smell of grave digging.

41:17.128 --> 41:21.115
I can't wait to tell all of our
grandchildren what amazing...

41:21.195 --> 41:23.888
Yeah, I get it, I get it.

41:23.968 --> 41:25.657
Do you?

41:25.737 --> 41:27.526
I don't think you do.

41:28.406 --> 41:31.896
Does any of this actually fucking bother you?

41:32.376 --> 41:36.905
Lisa's fucked, I don't even know
what Melissa's thinking.

41:37.215 --> 41:39.213
- But you?
- Me?

41:39.293 --> 41:42.049
Yeah! What the fuck are you thinking?

41:46.124 --> 41:48.613
- I just want us to...
- To be what?

41:48.693 --> 41:50.984
To live happily ever after?

41:52.296 --> 41:57.723
I don't know how you can stand there
and pretend that we can be some...

41:57.803 --> 42:00.725
If you hadn't of got out of that goddamn car!

42:00.805 --> 42:02.195
Fuck you!

42:03.808 --> 42:06.598
Oh, really? Are you done?

42:06.678 --> 42:09.233
You can dig your own fucking grave!

42:38.710 --> 42:40.602
Come on!

42:44.282 --> 42:46.638
Hey, you guys, come
and help me move the body?

42:46.718 --> 42:50.172
- Where's Thalia?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

43:31.195 --> 43:33.406
Let's get this over and done with, yeah?

43:43.842 --> 43:46.884
Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go. Quick, quick.

43:50.982 --> 43:52.851
What the fuck?

44:08.633 --> 44:10.082
Hey!

44:14.272 --> 44:15.840
Mel?

44:19.110 --> 44:20.699
Melissa?

44:54.846 --> 44:57.201
- You said he was dead.
- He was dead!

44:57.281 --> 45:01.640
- Well, what if he calls the fucking police?
- So what if he fucking calls the police.

45:01.720 --> 45:04.843
- So what if he calls the police?
- Yes! He attacked you!

45:04.923 --> 45:08.580
He attacked you. Why do you fucking care?

45:10.728 --> 45:14.420
- Oh, my God. Are you serious?
- I can't fucking deal with you right now.

45:15.550 --> 45:17.440
Just calm down!

45:17.769 --> 45:20.892
Okay, Thalia is missing
in the fucking woods, okay?

45:20.972 --> 45:22.694
- She is missing!
- How do you know that?

45:22.774 --> 45:25.429
- You don't care?
- Of course I care.

45:25.509 --> 45:29.169
No, you don't care.
You just care about that stupid body.

45:41.760 --> 45:43.349
God.

45:57.742 --> 46:00.168
So what's going on with you two anyway?

46:03.414 --> 46:04.769
Nothing.

46:04.849 --> 46:07.673
- Nothing?
- Yeah, nothing.

46:08.653 --> 46:10.544
Didn't sound like nothing.

46:15.827 --> 46:18.116
Did you hear that?

46:18.196 --> 46:20.018
Yeah, thanks.

46:23.535 --> 46:25.123
Sorry.

46:27.605 --> 46:30.852
You know, she's probably
just pulling one of her pranks.

46:32.277 --> 46:37.336
I wouldn't be surprised if she
comes back in, like, two minutes time.

46:39.718 --> 46:41.306
Seriously.

46:44.255 --> 46:46.645
- Eww, God!
- You got dirt on you, Mel.

46:46.725 --> 46:48.581
Come here.

46:50.194 --> 46:52.122
We really have to sort this out.

46:54.699 --> 46:56.788
Did you catch anything?

46:56.868 --> 46:58.771
Not exactly.

46:59.303 --> 47:01.125
I hope you like vegetables.

47:01.506 --> 47:03.415
Uh, yes.

47:05.409 --> 47:07.512
Where are your friends?

47:08.012 --> 47:11.695
Oh, uh, Lisa is inside and...

47:12.333 --> 47:13.876
...um...

49:08.833 --> 49:12.859
I warned you girls, for your own protection.

49:13.805 --> 49:17.896
I said very clearly,
you should not go into the woods...

49:17.976 --> 49:20.666
...and you walk into the woods.

49:24.282 --> 49:26.537
- It's like a maze...
- Like a maze.

49:26.618 --> 49:29.107
Yeah, yeah, we get it.

49:31.756 --> 49:36.382
Even I would not venture
past my regular routes.

49:39.030 --> 49:41.458
Do you have any family, Miss Perkins?

49:46.738 --> 49:49.594
My family have all passed away sadly.

49:49.874 --> 49:51.233
Sorry.

49:51.743 --> 49:53.339
What for?

49:55.680 --> 49:56.944
My mother...

49:58.463 --> 50:00.355
...she was a wicked woman.

50:01.119 --> 50:03.408
Drove my father right up the...

50:04.088 --> 50:07.112
...whatever word you young
things use these days.

50:08.342 --> 50:11.184
At least that's what I hear.

50:12.697 --> 50:14.753
I don't even remember my family.

50:15.433 --> 50:16.956
I was too young.

50:17.036 --> 50:20.059
And did you live here as a family?

50:22.474 --> 50:25.097
- Yes.
- Sorry.

50:25.510 --> 50:28.601
It's just I lost my family is all.

50:31.683 --> 50:33.522
My parents.

50:34.353 --> 50:37.444
I do apologize for not having a telephone...

50:40.458 --> 50:42.012
...but...

50:43.411 --> 50:44.995
...tomorrow...

50:47.431 --> 50:51.324
...our gardener will hopefully,
he'll be able to...

50:52.137 --> 50:54.918
...to get your car ready and...

50:55.310 --> 50:58.229
...and put you in touch
with the police and then...

50:58.309 --> 51:01.833
...maybe they will find your friend.

51:03.347 --> 51:06.607
I appreciate this is all very difficult.

51:06.688 --> 51:08.506
Do you?

51:11.189 --> 51:14.113
I have let you into my house.

51:15.159 --> 51:17.656
Do not be bitter with me.

51:27.271 --> 51:30.137
And you wonder why I don't like visitors.

52:28.967 --> 52:30.557
Please.

56:19.163 --> 56:21.019
Fuck sake.

56:22.601 --> 56:24.623
I don't know what we're gonna do.

56:25.403 --> 56:28.259
Even if we get gas tomorrow,
Thalia's not here.

56:28.339 --> 56:30.630
Surely she would have been home by now.

56:44.756 --> 56:47.780
I had the most incredible day
planned for us...

56:49.060 --> 56:51.332
...followed by an early night...

56:52.191 --> 56:54.453
...so we could be ready for the big day.

56:57.201 --> 56:59.025
This is a nightmare.

57:03.608 --> 57:05.597
I got you something.

57:05.677 --> 57:07.065
What?

57:10.014 --> 57:11.770
Something old.

57:13.918 --> 57:15.974
Gina coordinated.

57:18.490 --> 57:20.368
What are you talking about?

57:21.993 --> 57:26.620
She knows, something old, something new,
something borrowed, something blue.

57:28.232 --> 57:32.622
She thought seeings as I've
known you the longest, I should...

57:33.110 --> 57:34.914
get you something old.

58:11.843 --> 58:13.732
Mom's necklace.

58:15.647 --> 58:17.235
Yeah.

58:20.952 --> 58:23.643
So let's just get through tonight.

58:25.256 --> 58:28.347
The gardener will come,
he will fix the car...

58:29.427 --> 58:32.645
...on our way we'll get you married
and then we'll fuck off...

58:32.725 --> 58:35.376
...and we'll never speak
about this again, okay?

58:35.456 --> 58:36.955
Okay?

58:48.813 --> 58:51.637
- Lisa.
- Go to sleep, Mel.

58:54.953 --> 58:56.372
Okay.

01:00:44.813 --> 01:00:46.352
Thalia?

01:02:33.137 --> 01:02:34.727
Thalia?

01:02:43.632 --> 01:02:45.639
Is that Melissa's dress?

01:04:39.331 --> 01:04:40.919
Please.

01:04:44.669 --> 01:04:46.248
Please.

01:06:21.232 --> 01:06:22.838
What time is it?

01:06:26.605 --> 01:06:28.293
It's 11.

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:30.963
Shit, the gardener!

01:06:34.178 --> 01:06:35.600
Gina?

01:06:39.283 --> 01:06:40.873
Gina?

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.649
Miss Perkins.

01:06:50.729 --> 01:06:54.754
I'm not gonna lie, that fucking woman,
she's fucking creeping me out.

01:06:56.401 --> 01:06:58.256
Let's go.

01:07:08.079 --> 01:07:10.550
Where the fuck is everyone?

01:07:19.691 --> 01:07:24.983
No, no, no. No, no,
oh, my God, Gina! Gina, no!

01:07:25.864 --> 01:07:28.573
- We have to get out of here!
- Where's Thalia? We need to call the cops!

01:07:28.653 --> 01:07:33.124
- We're not calling the cops! Come on!
- No! No, what you gonna fucking run?

01:07:33.204 --> 01:07:36.087
Fucking, yeah, fucking run away just
like you did when Mom and Dad died!

01:07:36.167 --> 01:07:37.863
- Now you wanna do this?
- Yes, now!

01:07:37.943 --> 01:07:40.819
Actually I think now's
a pretty good fucking time!

01:07:44.199 --> 01:07:46.809
Fuck, let's go. Fuck.

01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:54.949
Holy Fuck. Thalia! Thalia. Are you okay?

01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:58.697
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Are you okay? Thalia, speak to me!

01:07:58.777 --> 01:08:01.186
Thalia... fuck!

01:08:01.933 --> 01:08:04.298
Thalia, who the fuck did this to you?

01:08:10.642 --> 01:08:11.996
Shh.

01:08:12.076 --> 01:08:14.500
I got you. Got you.

01:08:33.932 --> 01:08:35.520
You okay?

01:08:36.134 --> 01:08:39.357
- You okay? Shit.
- Behind you.

01:08:39.437 --> 01:08:41.488
Oh, my God, Lisa, behind you!

01:09:17.709 --> 01:09:20.566
Holy fuck. No!

01:09:21.513 --> 01:09:22.901
No!

01:09:27.786 --> 01:09:29.372
No!

01:10:32.417 --> 01:10:35.040
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.343
<i>They told me you didn't come.</i>

01:10:39.123 --> 01:10:41.943
<i>When they said you didn't turn up,
I didn't believe them.</i>

01:10:44.563 --> 01:10:46.609
<i>What is it I've done?</i>

01:10:49.968 --> 01:10:52.590
<i>I wasn't even going to call but...</i>

01:10:54.839 --> 01:10:57.273
<i>...I just wanted to know that you're okay.</i>

01:10:59.611 --> 01:11:01.786
<i>If you don't want to get married...</i>

01:11:01.866 --> 01:11:05.704
<i>...or it's too fast or it's too soon then...</i>

01:11:06.885 --> 01:11:08.841
<i>...that's fine.</i>

01:11:09.254 --> 01:11:12.276
<i>I just want you to be happy.</i>

01:11:13.592 --> 01:11:15.448
I love you.

01:11:39.484 --> 01:11:41.007
Miss Perkins.

01:11:42.621 --> 01:11:44.103
Miss Perkins.

01:12:06.478 --> 01:12:08.034
Miss Perkins?

01:14:11.002 --> 01:14:13.412
We're one and the same you and I.

01:14:14.172 --> 01:14:16.654
'Cause I have secrets too.

01:14:17.776 --> 01:14:21.866
Not my secrets, his secrets.

01:14:26.485 --> 01:14:29.508
He knows you're here now, dear. He knows.

01:14:31.356 --> 01:14:33.512
He knows that you've all been in his house.

01:14:33.592 --> 01:14:36.548
Whore, whore.

01:14:38.997 --> 01:14:43.988
I told you all not to be seen, didn't I?

01:14:44.068 --> 01:14:45.924
I told you.

01:14:47.305 --> 01:14:49.645
My... is that my dress?

01:14:55.414 --> 01:14:59.462
Oh, God, he's coming. He's coming.

01:14:59.542 --> 01:15:02.006
He's coming. Oh, my God.

01:15:04.222 --> 01:15:06.848
You should go now, Melissa. You should go!

01:15:25.108 --> 01:15:26.980
He's here.

01:15:31.916 --> 01:15:33.606
He's here.

01:15:34.764 --> 01:15:36.584
What... who's?

01:15:38.557 --> 01:15:40.145
Connor.

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:43.567
You're in my house!

01:15:51.102 --> 01:15:52.491
You.

01:16:12.958 --> 01:16:15.146
She warned you to leave.

01:16:15.226 --> 01:16:19.138
She told you if I got
my fucking hands on you!

01:16:19.798 --> 01:16:22.621
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:18:47.178 --> 01:18:49.308
Fuck you!

01:18:53.017 --> 01:18:55.733
Lisa. Lisa.

01:18:55.813 --> 01:18:57.387
Lisa.

01:18:58.957 --> 01:19:01.279
Lisa. Lisa. Lisa.

01:19:05.597 --> 01:19:07.853
Lisa, wake up.

01:19:08.433 --> 01:19:11.069
Lisa, wake up. Come here.

01:19:11.436 --> 01:19:14.729
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:19:14.809 --> 01:19:18.931
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Lisa, Lisa, wake up!

01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:22.166
Lisa, wake up. Lisa, wake up.

01:19:22.246 --> 01:19:24.469
- Come on, we have to go.
- You ran.

01:19:24.549 --> 01:19:29.407
I know, I'm really sorry. I fucked up.
I really fucked up but we have to go!

01:19:31.055 --> 01:19:34.079
I know, come on! I know, I know, come on.

01:19:51.309 --> 01:19:53.199
It's gonna be okay.

01:19:57.616 --> 01:19:59.505
I know.

01:20:05.457 --> 01:20:07.312
Where is she?

01:20:07.492 --> 01:20:09.382
I really don't know.

01:20:10.995 --> 01:20:12.817
The keys still in the car?

01:20:13.497 --> 01:20:15.220
- I think so, yeah.
- Shit!

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.556
What, what?

01:20:17.736 --> 01:20:20.026
Shit, shit.

01:20:23.908 --> 01:20:26.831
- You're gonna have to trust me okay?
- What?

01:20:26.911 --> 01:20:29.368
No! We have to go.

01:20:29.448 --> 01:20:31.336
We're gonna hide you.

01:20:32.216 --> 01:20:35.307
Go, please go!

01:20:40.759 --> 01:20:42.981
You're gonna have to trust me.

01:21:19.964 --> 01:21:23.055
<i># See how they run</i>

01:21:23.635 --> 01:21:26.725
<i># Three blind mice</i>

01:21:27.305 --> 01:21:30.596
<i># Three blind mice</i>

Fuck.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:25:37.356 --> 01:25:38.910
Fuck.

01:25:48.332 --> 01:25:50.621
I can smell you.

01:26:11.089 --> 01:26:14.178
I see you.

01:26:17.228 --> 01:26:18.883
Oh, no.

I saw you, whore.

01:28:28.126 --> 01:28:32.484
Do you really think
your husband will be faithful?

01:28:32.964 --> 01:28:35.521
Faithful to some whore?

01:28:35.834 --> 01:28:38.543
Do you think your marriage will last?

01:28:41.673 --> 01:28:43.502
I do.

01:29:21.345 --> 01:29:22.868
No.

01:29:37.162 --> 01:29:38.688
I had to do it.

01:29:39.398 --> 01:29:42.258
I have to keep his secrets.

01:29:45.970 --> 01:29:47.491
Whore!

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.616
