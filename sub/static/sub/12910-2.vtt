01:43.928 --> 01:47.140
Where should it be sent to?

02:05.950 --> 02:09.162
It is pineapple.

02:13.124 --> 02:16.377
Uncle? We have a problem with the mother.

02:19.798 --> 02:23.009
What's going on?
- I came to pick her up...

02:23.092 --> 02:28.765
But cousins?? came first.
They found her immediately.

02:28.848 --> 02:32.602
- Well, go home.
- Yes, sir.

02:37.190 --> 02:38.650
Satan also...

03:16.771 --> 03:22.777
- I heard it on the radio. 200 kilograms.
- We have been waiting for months.

03:22.860 --> 03:25.988
Did not you think they would react?

03:26.071 --> 03:29.951
I made amber in the in Secondigliano.

03:30.035 --> 03:33.621
What says our friend in Rome?
- Not a damn thing.

03:33.704 --> 03:37.791
Nunziata, I hired you and him in Rome.

03:37.875 --> 03:40.712
Do not forget it.

03:40.795 --> 03:46.467
We need to know what is going on.
This is not normal. Are you in?

03:46.551 --> 03:51.598
- What do you mean?
- They knew where to look.

03:51.682 --> 03:54.183
Someone tipped.

03:54.267 --> 03:59.772
- Now we hear what he says.
- Exactly.

03:59.856 --> 04:05.403
The police know that you are behind. They are
just waiting for you to blunder into them.

04:05.444 --> 04:08.406
Be careful.

04:22.295 --> 04:25.798
WELCOME TO Scampia

05:09.634 --> 05:13.096
This.

05:15.723 --> 05:20.145
It is from our vacation
in Greece last summer.

05:30.529 --> 05:34.742
Where are the guys?
- At home with mother.

05:37.661 --> 05:41.082
- The suit!
- Look, Antonietta.

05:41.124 --> 05:46.254
- I must choose his suit.
- Listen to me.

05:48.339 --> 05:54.053
- We must not bury him in the church.
Why? He was not a boss.

05:54.136 --> 05:57.390
Or an escape capture. Why?

05:59.057 --> 06:04.188
Because he died with a gun
by hand. We can not do anything.

06:04.272 --> 06:08.193
They shut him into the church.

06:25.835 --> 06:30.172
But more do not break your head.

06:31.090 --> 06:34.593
We'll fix that.

06:35.553 --> 06:40.975
Yes, of course.
First, get the boss kill him...

06:41.058 --> 06:44.478
And then he pays me.

06:44.562 --> 06:48.191
He shits on,
the funeral will be in the church!

06:48.275 --> 06:50.818
Keep your voice.

07:03.873 --> 07:07.836
Pick up the phone. Your boss calls.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.429
Hello?

07:18.763 --> 07:21.682
I'll be right there.

07:28.899 --> 07:34.945
- I'm sorry, Antonietta...
- You do not have to come here anymore.

07:37.365 --> 07:41.702
Do not dare to show up here more.

08:01.222 --> 08:04.308
- Hello.
Don Pietro wanted to see me.

08:04.392 --> 08:08.521
Yeah, come on. I follow you there.

08:08.563 --> 08:14.444
They're over at the neighbor.
It is the safest right now.

08:17.280 --> 08:21.827
Someone tipped.
The police got a tip.

08:25.079 --> 08:27.289
Could it have been Conte?

08:29.584 --> 08:34.087
Conte known Mexicans.
He may have known that the cargo came.

08:34.171 --> 08:38.301
So we must keep our eyes open.

08:38.884 --> 08:42.806
After the other night they're after us.

08:44.181 --> 08:50.230
Where's Bolletta?
- I called, but he did not answer.

08:50.313 --> 08:53.900
- Have the police caught him again?
- "Again"?

08:53.983 --> 08:59.197
- After it with Conte interrogated him.
Why I do not know anything about it?

08:59.280 --> 09:02.534
- Because it is not...
- It was not anything important.

09:02.618 --> 09:07.247
They detained him all day,
then drove him home again.

09:07.330 --> 09:10.124
Renato is here.

09:10.541 --> 09:13.336
Bolletta.

09:13.879 --> 09:18.299
- Where the hell have you been?
- There was a problem in Casavatore.

09:18.382 --> 09:22.512
In Casavatore? What problem?

09:23.805 --> 09:27.391
What you need to ask Their son Genny on.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.687
Get your son.

09:42.991 --> 09:46.160
Genny?

09:54.169 --> 09:58.965
- Genna?
- Mother?

10:04.554 --> 10:08.683
How you smell nice.

10:09.684 --> 10:13.313
What were you doing in Casavatore night?

10:16.859 --> 10:20.444
I saw a girl a drink.

10:20.528 --> 10:26.285
- Suddenly this ride up...
He's friends with a boss.

10:26.326 --> 10:30.955
- How should I know?
- You never know shit.

10:31.039 --> 10:35.043
You can pjanke with the girls in our area.

10:35.878 --> 10:40.757
They are only small fish.
And he smashed my motorcycle.

10:40.840 --> 10:44.010
I is a Savastano!

10:44.093 --> 10:50.683
Genna. We have to get along with everyone
also with the small fish.

10:50.724 --> 10:54.813
Perceived, Gennaro.
He smashed your motorcycle.

10:54.896 --> 10:58.482
But what did you do?

11:00.234 --> 11:03.738
I was angry.

11:39.399 --> 11:42.694
CASAVATORE
CAN TROUGH MY ASSHOLE!

11:58.585 --> 12:02.963
- Relax! Do you know who this is?
I know who I am.

12:03.005 --> 12:07.051
- Who are you?
- Come on, Bolletta...

12:10.347 --> 12:12.723
Come inside.

12:17.937 --> 12:20.732
I can not go with him.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.785
Is your father here?

12:33.452 --> 12:37.791
He's retired.
- Should I talk to you?

12:37.874 --> 12:41.628
Yes, it's me who is here now.

12:41.711 --> 12:47.133
What do we do? I do not have time
for this. What does it cost?

12:47.217 --> 12:50.303
I do not want money, don Pietro.

12:50.720 --> 12:54.265
I have lost face.
And the face is everything.

12:54.349 --> 12:58.979
It was many years ago,
I went to school Parisi.

12:59.062 --> 13:02.982
How do you plan To solve this?

13:04.108 --> 13:07.737
Come, let us go out and drink a coffee.

13:19.791 --> 13:23.877
He did so,
so now he has to clean up after themselves.

13:32.805 --> 13:38.559
- Do you really mean, Parisi?
- He can not escape easily from it.

13:38.643 --> 13:41.438
Now listen to me.

13:41.521 --> 13:46.693
I came here with good intentions.
I should have stayed at home.

13:46.776 --> 13:51.615
But now you gone too far with your bullshit.

13:51.698 --> 13:55.409
Now you owe me an apology.

13:55.493 --> 14:00.039
Don Pietro... This ends up wrong.

14:00.874 --> 14:06.379
Then we'd better call your dad again.

14:09.173 --> 14:14.179
- Good return!
- Now we have to kill him.

14:16.430 --> 14:20.518
Do you understand now,
what that bullshit can lead to?

14:39.454 --> 14:43.875
- Look at that.
- Damn, there's a lot of police.

14:43.959 --> 14:48.003
- Damn it!
- Pull over, Bolletta.

15:02.644 --> 15:07.899
Turn the engine off, take the keys out
and put them on the car roof.

15:07.982 --> 15:12.779
Stig slowly out of the car
with your hands up.

15:12.862 --> 15:16.324
Close the car door.

15:16.366 --> 15:19.660
Now the passenger
in the front seat to get out.

15:21.203 --> 15:24.374
Close the car door
and place your hands on the car roof.

15:24.457 --> 15:29.003
Now the passenger
right in the back seat to get out.

15:29.045 --> 15:32.048
Close the car door
place your hands on the car roof.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.134
Now the passenger
to the left in the back seat...

15:39.055 --> 15:45.311
<i>It is the largest seizure
of drugs in Naples for 10 years.</i>

15:45.395 --> 15:48.815
<i>Judges now have the option</i>

15:48.898 --> 15:54.278
<i>to gain a better insight
in the new cocaine routes alliances</i>

15:54.362 --> 15:59.950
<i>and in whom distributes
the South American cocaine</i>

16:00.034 --> 16:04.497
<i>as Italy and throughout Europe
inundated by...</i>

16:06.749 --> 16:11.545
- Can I go?
- Where are you going?

16:14.257 --> 16:16.927
- I assume.
- Where?

16:17.010 --> 16:21.931
- I have seen with Pino and Carminello.
- It is teeming with police.

16:22.015 --> 16:27.062
- Well, yes. I need a new bike.
- Yes, of course, dear Genny.

16:27.145 --> 16:32.524
- What color should it be?
- Red.

16:32.608 --> 16:36.029
Hey, Mom.
Hey.

16:37.030 --> 16:43.912
When I was 20, I had balls.
I watched all that the father did.

16:43.995 --> 16:47.165
How is Genny just.
He's not like us.

16:47.624 --> 16:52.587
- Where the hell is he from?
It's our fault. He is spoiled.

16:52.670 --> 16:57.300
Too spoiled.
Do not buy a new motorcycle.

16:58.719 --> 17:03.681
- If only it was enough.
- First things first.

17:13.733 --> 17:18.363
Not even a cleric,
a priest, not a damn thing.

17:18.404 --> 17:21.366
No one.

17:23.242 --> 17:26.037
What a mercy...

17:28.498 --> 17:33.962
- Why do not we go there?
- The police are there.

17:40.719 --> 17:44.097
Are you sad?

17:44.179 --> 17:48.560
He was like a father to me.

17:53.523 --> 17:57.026
What was he like as a father?

18:01.197 --> 18:04.033
He was easy.

18:07.495 --> 18:11.207
You would have been a perfect father.

18:25.179 --> 18:31.311
They were right. Someone tipped.
He called anti-Mafia police.

18:31.395 --> 18:33.647
- Who?
- We do not know.

18:33.730 --> 18:36.899
He said he could
to present you with the police.

18:36.982 --> 18:42.739
- He tipped them on the load instead.
- I want to know who he is.

18:42.823 --> 18:47.243
- I'll do my best.
- I want that name.

18:48.495 --> 18:52.082
Do not worry, I'll take care.

18:56.627 --> 19:02.676
Now we have to move out again
to clean up after Genny.

19:02.759 --> 19:06.971
Imagine if it was your motorcycle.

19:07.055 --> 19:11.100
I'm a good boy,
when I'm at home with others.

19:11.184 --> 19:15.647
We can grab Parisi,
when he is seen with his whore.

19:15.730 --> 19:18.524
- Stop. Let me out.
What do you mean?

19:18.608 --> 19:22.987
Let me out.
I do not want that shit.

19:23.071 --> 19:28.493
Should we shoot Parisi and do more
fuss? With a traitor among us?

19:31.954 --> 19:36.210
And if the police arrest Pietro

19:36.293 --> 19:41.798
- Do you know who who takes over
his place? Who? Idiot Genny?

20:12.287 --> 20:18.042
Every Saturday seen Parisi
with his mistress, a Romanian prostitute.

20:18.084 --> 20:21.296
It is Saturday today.

20:21.379 --> 20:24.841
We go there and take him down.

20:26.134 --> 20:29.595
Are you listening, Don Pietro?

20:31.931 --> 20:38.480
We do it like that don Pietro.
But the police are everywhere.

20:38.564 --> 20:42.358
Is it really the right time?

20:43.193 --> 20:46.905
- Determines you this?
No, but...

20:46.988 --> 20:50.492
So keep your mouth shut, Malamò.

21:06.758 --> 21:11.137
They asked for me, Don Pietro.

21:14.765 --> 21:18.019
Take a seat, Ciro.

21:29.948 --> 21:35.829
You as well Parisi, right? He is
almost 30 years and is already a leader.

21:35.912 --> 21:38.998
Parisi is an idiot.

21:39.082 --> 21:44.545
- But we put a stop to.
- It's not about Parisi.

21:46.130 --> 21:51.219
- It's about Genny.
- What do you mean?

21:54.556 --> 21:59.603
If something happens to me,
he takes my place.

21:59.645 --> 22:04.733
What do you think about that?
- That he's your son.

22:04.816 --> 22:08.486
And what do the others?

22:08.570 --> 22:14.075
They all feel the same.
Genny is a Savastano.

22:14.159 --> 22:18.538
Ciro, drop that shit with me.

22:19.539 --> 22:23.042
I know what they mean.

22:23.084 --> 22:26.838
That he is not good enough.

22:26.921 --> 22:30.342
And they are right.

22:30.425 --> 22:35.764
He's not ready yet.
He needs more time.

22:35.847 --> 22:39.726
Time, as we may not have.

22:42.104 --> 22:46.023
But one thing must be done, Ciro.

22:47.025 --> 22:50.403
Without it, it will never be his turn,
if he so than the son of God.

22:50.486 --> 22:53.990
- Why me?
Because you care about Genny.

22:54.073 --> 22:59.371
- But it is a good moment right now?
Is that a problem for you?

22:59.454 --> 23:03.333
You do not understand.
For me it is an honor.

23:03.417 --> 23:07.336
So be happy with it.

23:40.787 --> 23:44.666
Is the fresh air lovely?

23:49.629 --> 23:53.925
- You to fuck with me.
- Who?

24:02.266 --> 24:06.895
Was it Nunziatas message?

24:10.942 --> 24:13.988
What will you do about it?

24:17.406 --> 24:21.285
Do you want to sit here
and wait for the police?

24:21.369 --> 24:25.875
What should I do?
Kill them one by one?

24:25.958 --> 24:29.502
Travelling from here.

24:29.586 --> 24:35.592
Stay away for a while.
We wait until the storm has subsided.

24:37.176 --> 24:43.308
And so it should be okay.
Who'll fix it? Genny, you?

24:45.643 --> 24:49.939
I will not go into hiding as a father.

24:56.906 --> 25:02.535
You're not going to jail. Got it?

25:02.619 --> 25:07.415
They breathed down your neck
for 20 years, but you're still here.

25:07.499 --> 25:11.086
You're not going anywhere.

25:21.763 --> 25:26.100
You know, Ciro?
I do not regret it in Casavatore.

25:26.184 --> 25:31.063
It does not anymore.
You must be thinking. Are you in?

25:31.147 --> 25:36.862
Sooner or later it will be your turn.
Your father does not live forever.

25:40.322 --> 25:43.952
And besides, it was bad timing.

25:44.035 --> 25:47.914
If the father is not there,
should you decide about me?

25:47.998 --> 25:50.666
And why was it bad timing?

25:50.750 --> 25:55.839
Do you know why I do not regret
something? A: Because I was angry.

25:55.922 --> 26:02.470
And because I was there with a girl,
Noemi. She is so beautiful.

26:02.553 --> 26:07.809
What should I do with this?
- Throw it out.

26:09.185 --> 26:15.275
I'd like to find a beautiful girl
who care about me.

26:15.358 --> 26:19.237
One that gives me peace.

26:20.114 --> 26:25.243
- What do we do with it?
We see if it still works. Come on.

26:28.121 --> 26:30.457
Felice? Felice?

26:32.833 --> 26:36.463
- Felice! Come here.
Why?

26:36.546 --> 26:40.342
I have a nice gift for you. Come on.

26:41.551 --> 26:44.929
Come on. Here you go.

26:45.012 --> 26:49.017
His name Savastano.
Gennaro, Felice.

26:49.101 --> 26:53.563
What do I do with it?
- Shoot him! Shoot him!

26:53.605 --> 26:57.734
- Shut up!
- I have not done anything!

26:57.817 --> 27:00.487
Run! Run!

27:00.571 --> 27:04.365
Shoot! Come on, Gennaro!

27:08.370 --> 27:12.916
Do it with him, Gennaro.
Do it with him! Come on!

27:12.999 --> 27:18.630
- Come on!
- I have not done anything!

27:30.017 --> 27:33.103
Moving on!

28:05.385 --> 28:10.432
Now listen carefully.
It is best for both of us-

28:10.516 --> 28:15.019
-That we say that you did it.

28:15.103 --> 28:19.107
Otherwise there will be just problems.

28:19.190 --> 28:23.946
Understood, Genna? You did it.

28:24.697 --> 28:27.324
I understand that.

28:55.269 --> 28:58.688
So what?

28:59.313 --> 29:02.943
It is pisselet killing.

29:14.788 --> 29:19.542
Now you can make it.
I can die with peace of mind.

29:22.129 --> 29:27.301
Your new motorcycle stands at
dealer. Go and get it.

29:34.849 --> 29:37.977
How did you shoot him?

29:38.895 --> 29:43.859
What do you mean?
- One, two, three shots?

29:45.235 --> 29:50.114
With one shot. Only one shot.

29:55.621 --> 29:59.916
You are also sure hits.

30:14.222 --> 30:18.852
<i>Where is the bold. It is wildly bold</i>

30:18.936 --> 30:22.605
<i>I wish I had a father
who could fix everything for me.</i>

30:22.688 --> 30:26.568
<i>Now Casavatore just wait for him.</i>

30:44.043 --> 30:47.798
You were not long in to get to Naples.

30:50.341 --> 30:54.178
Well? Why was urgent that?

30:58.017 --> 31:02.103
The day I'm not here anymore...

31:02.354 --> 31:07.484
- What do you mean?
- Musi, I do not have much time. Reply.

31:07.568 --> 31:11.738
Is my money safety, or what?

31:11.821 --> 31:15.784
Yes, of course. As always.

31:17.744 --> 31:23.249
If anything happens to me,
you should take care of it all.

31:23.333 --> 31:28.589
Imma, Genny.
No one should have no worries.

31:29.547 --> 31:34.093
It just lacked otherwise.
You can count on me.

31:34.176 --> 31:40.893
I have a general overview.
They must also be informed.

31:40.976 --> 31:46.606
I've taken the last couple of things.
What comes before, do you know of.

31:47.148 --> 31:51.904
I'm sorry, but...
Are you saying this because...

31:53.071 --> 31:57.284
- ... That something has happened?
- You never know.

31:59.411 --> 32:03.164
Things are going pretty well for us.
We earn fat to the crisis.

32:03.247 --> 32:10.213
I will not be pretentious, but we
bought good stocks cheap...

33:04.685 --> 33:07.562
Yes, Malamò?
It's done.

33:07.603 --> 33:11.900
Go and take a drink.
I give.

33:11.984 --> 33:16.904
- It's just me and Zecchinetta.
Where's Bolletta?

33:16.987 --> 33:20.617
I do not know.
He was something else.

33:54.985 --> 33:58.362
Don Pietro. Come inside.

34:09.081 --> 34:14.045
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Why were not you at Parisi?

34:17.632 --> 34:23.013
Was not abundant Malamò
and Zecchinetta for someone like him?

34:23.764 --> 34:29.726
And I needed something else. I was
collect the money in Sette Palazzi.

34:29.811 --> 34:34.983
With all the police was the best,
that they were lying there.

34:36.109 --> 34:40.197
I would give you money tomorrow morning,
but now you are here after all.

34:40.280 --> 34:44.034
I make coffee for us, Don Pietro.

34:45.244 --> 34:49.664
Is it true that the police
brought you in for questioning?

34:50.498 --> 34:55.295
Yes, it was carabinieri.
It was nothing.

34:55.378 --> 35:00.174
They tried to blow me away, but I
showed them shooting range receipt.

35:00.258 --> 35:04.846
- That you know my name?
No, of course not.

35:04.929 --> 35:12.270
They asked where I had been,
which day we shot and with whom.

35:12.353 --> 35:15.357
I was back home after a few hours.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.527
After a few hours?

35:24.491 --> 35:28.495
Why did the others,
that you were there all day?

35:29.621 --> 35:34.000
Do not worry you, Don Pietro.

35:34.083 --> 35:38.880
They checked me
because I was released recently.

35:38.964 --> 35:44.928
If they had something on me after all
the commotion, they had shut me up.

35:52.352 --> 35:56.064
Do not worry. They have nothing on us.

35:56.148 --> 35:58.650
Bolletta...

36:00.903 --> 36:05.365
They found cocaine cargo
because someone had tipped.

36:09.369 --> 36:14.081
My goodness!
They do not know that it was me?

36:14.582 --> 36:18.878
I swear on my mother, I'm innocent.

36:18.962 --> 36:25.427
I have been with you for 20 years. We have
stood together through thick and thin.

36:25.510 --> 36:30.891
How can you believe I betray you?

36:42.111 --> 36:44.446
Goodbye, Bolletta.

37:33.453 --> 37:36.665
Don Pietro, you forgot...

39:55.387 --> 40:00.600
- Cheers to narrøven Parisi.
Forget him.

40:00.684 --> 40:05.731
Cheers to my son, which was man today.

40:05.814 --> 40:08.942
- Not true, Ciro?
- Yes.

40:10.569 --> 40:15.490
- Cheers to Gennaro.
- For Gennaro!

40:17.451 --> 40:21.120
I have not seen Bolletta all night.

40:21.204 --> 40:24.082
It was Bolletta who betrayed us.

40:28.670 --> 40:31.965
Bolletta?

40:32.507 --> 40:36.345
- Are you sure?
What do you mean?

40:36.428 --> 40:39.973
Is it more likely it was you?

40:40.057 --> 40:44.185
Or Zecchinetta? Or Ciro?

40:44.602 --> 40:48.691
Is there one of you,
who will raise their hands?

40:49.650 --> 40:53.820
Do not worry about it.
It's done. You can go now.

40:57.908 --> 41:02.621
- Good night.
- Cyrus, can I talk to you?

41:10.962 --> 41:15.258
Tell me what happened.

41:16.843 --> 41:21.390
How'd Genny guy to death?

41:21.473 --> 41:26.561
- He shot him.
- I know. But how?

41:26.603 --> 41:31.525
First a shot from a distance
and then a shot at close range.

41:31.609 --> 41:35.445
It was demonstrated by Genny.

41:35.528 --> 41:39.282
It required a little bit of persuasion.

41:42.661 --> 41:46.206
Ciro, do you really...

41:46.290 --> 41:50.294
That it is appropriate
to sit here and bullshit?

41:57.259 --> 42:01.221
He shot a little off.

42:02.431 --> 42:06.810
- I killed him.
- Why did you lie to me?

42:06.893 --> 42:10.271
He shot the still.

42:10.355 --> 42:14.776
Don Pietro, Gennaro would make you happy.

42:26.037 --> 42:29.249
You know what I stand and think of?

42:29.916 --> 42:36.547
That when it gets Gennys trip
you have to be number two.

42:40.218 --> 42:43.222
Are you happy with it?

42:44.848 --> 42:48.227
Yes, it is a great honor.

42:48.310 --> 42:53.857
But you must not think of it.
For you are here and you are here.

42:53.940 --> 42:58.862
If that were to happen,
please stand by Gennys page.

43:04.493 --> 43:10.373
But until then it's me, charge here.

43:10.457 --> 43:14.044
And if you lie to me...

43:15.754 --> 43:19.383
I am furious...

43:28.350 --> 43:30.978
Here you go.

43:31.061 --> 43:33.647
Drink. Drink up.

43:38.734 --> 43:43.740
Show me that I can trust you.
Are you just a liar-

43:43.823 --> 43:49.704
Or can I put my son's life
and my business in your hands?

44:47.805 --> 44:51.099
It was good, Ciro.

46:45.130 --> 46:47.633
Nunziata?

46:53.848 --> 46:56.683
So what? What happened?

46:56.767 --> 47:00.061
The traitor called again.

47:00.145 --> 47:04.317
- When?
Nu. They warned me right after.

47:04.774 --> 47:08.362
What the hell are you talking about?
- It's true.

47:08.403 --> 47:15.368
They promised him gold and green forests,
but he would consider it.

47:15.452 --> 47:21.000
They must be heard in again. We do everything
to find out who it is.

47:21.083 --> 47:26.003
But I think we reveal him
before he makes a sound again.

48:26.398 --> 48:29.359
What is it, Imma?

48:54.343 --> 48:58.055
What do you want, Malamò?

48:59.181 --> 49:03.477
When? How is he?

49:03.560 --> 49:07.982
I'm on the road.
On my way, I said.

49:49.648 --> 49:52.317
Turn off the engine.

49:55.487 --> 49:58.491
Add the keys to the car roof.

50:00.367 --> 50:03.953
The increase slowly with your hands up.

50:08.792 --> 50:13.213
My son is in the hospital.
He was an accident.

50:13.297 --> 50:16.383
Browse car.

50:16.925 --> 50:20.679
- My son is in the hospital!
- Relax.

50:23.598 --> 50:27.894
If anything happens to him, you're screwed!

50:36.111 --> 50:40.032
- Look at this.
- We played cards and I won.

50:40.115 --> 50:43.201
Kropsvisiter him.

50:55.380 --> 50:58.676
Well, you won money at cards?

50:58.759 --> 51:03.472
It's not my jacket.
I borrowed it.

51:03.555 --> 51:08.018
It's not my jacket!
- Stand still.

51:08.102 --> 51:14.399
We do like this. I get the bag.
There are over 50,000 in.

51:14.482 --> 51:18.111
- Take the bag.
- Stand still.

51:18.194 --> 51:22.824
You will regret
you came to the world! Dickhead!

51:46.848 --> 51:48.434
- Cyrus.
Hey.

51:48.517 --> 51:53.606
- Have they said anything?
He's there, but we do not know anything.

51:53.689 --> 51:58.485
- This is serious, right?
- I do not know.

51:58.569 --> 52:02.364
The fucking motorcycle...

52:11.957 --> 52:16.127
How are Genny it?
- We are waiting to get a response.

52:16.211 --> 52:20.465
There is bad news.
Police have busted Don Pietro.

52:20.549 --> 52:24.637
What the hell do you mean?
- He was on his way here.

52:24.721 --> 52:31.101
One thing at a time. First, Genny
survive the operation.

52:31.185 --> 52:38.024
Call the lawyer, Ciro.
Will you please take care of it?

52:41.070 --> 52:44.615
What happens Ciro?

52:48.952 --> 52:54.291
- Deborah?
- Do not worry, it's gonna be okay.

52:56.084 --> 52:59.421
He said he saw that it was red.

53:00.673 --> 53:06.428
- But he drove on purpose.
- He did so always.

53:07.096 --> 53:11.099
Speaking rumors true?

53:11.183 --> 53:15.021
How are Gennaro it?
- He is under observation.

53:15.562 --> 53:19.691
- Will he live?
- I do not know.

53:19.775 --> 53:25.447
Don Pietro is in jail and Genny
in the hospital. Now what?

53:27.324 --> 53:32.955
We're not talking about now. I must go.
I'll call you later.

53:33.038 --> 53:35.708
Hey.
