STARBUCK: Previously on

GAETA: There's enough algae on this
planet to feed the entire fleet,

00:30.698 --> 00:33.533
but the star in the system
is highly unstable.

00:33.617 --> 00:36.285
If you can believe it, on
the verge of going supernova.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.372
TIGH: We just picked up four
baseships inbound at high speed.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.623

a matter of time

00:40.708 --> 00:43.459

we're up to on this planet.

DUALLA:
Starbuck has gone down!

00:48.716 --> 00:50.383
I am going after my wife!

00:50.509 --> 00:53.720
I can't let you do that, Sam. I
am not asking you for permission.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.430
Sergeant Mathias.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.683
BOOMER: What if I told you that
your daughter was still alive?

00:58.809 --> 01:01.477
I'd say you were lying. She's
on our baseship right now.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.771
She's ill,
and we don't know why.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.398
TYROL: I don't even know
how I found this place.

01:05.482 --> 01:09.694
I just got this urge to start
walking, and then suddenly here it is.

01:10.446 --> 01:12.947
The scriptures say that this
Temple is the final resting place

01:13.031 --> 01:14.198
of the Eye of Jupiter.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.992
What exactly are
we talking about?

01:16.076 --> 01:19.328
It's a marker that was left
behind by the Thirteenth Tribe.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.414
It's supposed to point
the way to Earth.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.166
We want the Eye of Jupiter.

01:23.250 --> 01:27.920
Make any attempt to attack this ship
or the people on the planet's surface,

01:28.005 --> 01:30.089
I'll launch every
nuke I've got.

01:30.174 --> 01:31.966
ADAMA: Major, you've got
to hold off the Cylons

01:32.050 --> 01:33.926
until Chief finds
the Eye of Jupiter.

01:34.011 --> 01:37.138
If it looks like they're gonna get into
the Temple, your order is to blow it.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.556
We have to go down
to the planet.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.101
I am so close to seeing the
faces of the last five Cylons.

We just picked up six Heavy Raiders
heading down toward the planet.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.862
Order nuclear
ground-strike missiles.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.948
I'm not gonna let the Cylons
get their hands on the Eye.

to sacrifice Lee?

01:58.535 --> 02:00.745

is now authorized.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.442
XO,

02:32.361 --> 02:34.570
please input
your firing code.

02:36.406 --> 02:41.285
These nukes will obliterate anything or
anyone within 20 clicks of the Temple.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.745
ADAMA: I know.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.958
LEOBEN: He's gonna do it.
Recall the Raiders immediately.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.960
We agree.
Bring them back.

02:49.044 --> 02:51.295
We agree.
After all this time,

02:51.421 --> 02:53.464
we can't afford
to lose everything.

02:53.549 --> 02:56.843
We agree.
Bring them back.

03:03.058 --> 03:07.937
If Kara dies out there, I swear
to Gods, I will kill you myself.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.607
If she dies out there,
I'll let you.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.241
So, what are we gonna do now,
follow me around with a gun?

03:20.325 --> 03:24.078
Because that is the only way
that I am not going after Kara.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.708
Private Sykes.
Sir?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.836
Get Lieutenant Dualla
on the line.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.296
Yes, sir.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.173
I'm here.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.634
APOLLO: Do you have eyeballs
on Starbuck's position?

03:38.719 --> 03:39.886
Negative. We have no
visual on her Raptor,

03:39.970 --> 03:42.013
but I can see smoke
from the crash site.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.557
She went down behind a hill
a couple clicks away.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.058
Can you get to the Raptor?

03:46.143 --> 03:48.895
I don't know. It's pretty far
away. There's minimal cover.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.229
Is it doable?

03:50.314 --> 03:51.314
I don't know.

03:52.941 --> 03:53.983

finding Earth as much as we do.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.505
He won't just destroy it.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.383
We spoke, and the decision's been made.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.517
Fire on my mark.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.981
Sir, the Raiders
are turning back.

04:37.027 --> 04:40.196
Not all of them. Correction.
Five have turned back.

04:40.322 --> 04:43.115
One is still en route
back to the planet.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.203
What are you doing?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.664
He won't launch
against just one ship.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.582
He won't.
That's not the issue.

04:51.667 --> 04:55.503
We made a decision.
D'Anna has to turn back.

04:57.881 --> 04:58.881
No.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.509
CAPRICA SIX:
Call D'Anna and Baltar.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.970
Turn them around now.
D'ANNA: No!

05:04.054 --> 05:06.055
What do you mean, no?

05:06.139 --> 05:09.392
This is something
that we have to do.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.602
He won't launch over
one ship. You'll see.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.481
You want me...

05:15.816 --> 05:18.401
You want me
to rescue Captain Thrace?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.070
Attempt the rescue.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.322
Yes, sir.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.033
Foxfire One out.

05:28.745 --> 05:29.870
We go.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.082

06:00.610 --> 06:03.779
That is not a good sign,

06:05.282 --> 06:07.616
She defied us,
defied the group.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.661
LEOBEN: It's not about the
Eye of Jupiter. It's about her.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.831
It's like we don't even
know them anymore.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.251
We may have to do
something about this.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.797
We may have to do it
sooner than later.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.803
Hera's alive. I'm her mother,
and I'm going to get her.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.306
Sharon, baby,
listen to me, okay?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.934
We can take a Raptor. We can
fly to the baseship ourselves.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.312
I don't...
I don't care anymore.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.149
We can't.

06:42.486 --> 06:45.821
We'll find another way.
We will.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.200
There is no other way.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.041
Don't ask me
to do this, Sharon.

07:07.511 --> 07:08.969
Listen to me.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.807
You have always
been the strong one.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.851
You believed in us
when no one else would.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.657
I'm begging you to do this.

07:31.910 --> 07:35.121
Find the courage to do this
for both of us, okay?

07:52.931 --> 07:54.306

Gods, if you'd...

09:56.554 --> 09:59.598
Seen the look in her eyes when
I... She has important information

09:59.683 --> 10:03.185
on our defenses.
Codes, procedures,

10:03.645 --> 10:06.939
the tactical situation down
on the planet's surface.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.442
The Cylons have access
to all of that as well.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.486
She won't betray us.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.697
You know that.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.448
It's why you gave her
the uniform.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.868
She may not have a choice.
Did you consider that?

10:20.787 --> 10:24.415
She says she could resist,
that she wouldn't let it happen.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.709
She'll get Hera,

10:28.837 --> 10:30.379
and she'll come back.

10:30.463 --> 10:34.341
That's quite a leap of faith
you've made, there, Captain.

10:34.426 --> 10:38.012
And if it involved your family
only, I'd say it was brave.

10:40.015 --> 10:44.143
But you've put the entire fleet
in jeopardy, are you aware of that?

10:50.233 --> 10:52.067
If you hadn't lied

10:53.903 --> 10:57.865
and stolen our baby
in the first place,

10:59.909 --> 11:01.994
we wouldn't
be here at all.

11:20.638 --> 11:24.266
I've certainly played my part
in bringing us to this moment.

11:25.977 --> 11:29.938
And there's plenty of blame to
throw around, and I accept it.

And now all of our lives are
in the hands of Sharon Agathon.

11:34.069 --> 11:37.571
All we can do is hope
that your wife is worthy

11:37.655 --> 11:41.033
of the unconditional trust
you place in her, Captain.

They wouldn't let me
see my daughter,

12:13.483 --> 12:15.150

What they did to me,

12:40.260 --> 12:42.010
stealing my baby

12:43.513 --> 12:45.722
and telling me
she was dead...

12:47.851 --> 12:49.393
You proved it.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.564
Hera's safer here,

12:55.567 --> 12:56.984

we've been waiting for.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.158

the anointed one.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.837

15:21.921 --> 15:23.338
That's what I'm afraid of.

15:24.674 --> 15:28.844
To know the face of God
is to know madness.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.723
The Hybrid has looked into the
space between life and death,

15:32.807 --> 15:36.268
and she's seen things
that we cannot conceive of,

15:36.352 --> 15:38.979
but she's been driven mad
as a result.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.568
Put your life in his hands.

to your destiny.

I'm grateful to you.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.416
For everything.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.462
Her destiny will part company
from yours, Gaius.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.631
She's not the Chosen One.
You are.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.551
Yes, I know.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.679

don't dance to the Major's tune?

16:44.629 --> 16:46.922
What happens is we get
splattered all over these rocks.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.549
Shut up. This is his game, not ours.

16:49.634 --> 16:53.220
We just do what we're told,
and maybe we get out of here.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.682
You really think these
civvies can stop them?

16:56.766 --> 17:01.603
Well, they stopped plenty of them on
Caprica while we were running for our lives.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.449
Okay, three clankers
just entered our kill zone.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.576
Gotta be their
recon element.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.787
Sykes, give them
the signal.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.002
All right, showtime,
showtime.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.308
All right,
they're headed our way.

17:41.602 --> 17:44.563
Don't detonate
till they're all the way in.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.462
Wait for it.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.715
Come on, you sons of bitches.
Come on.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.638
Now, now, now, now.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.022
Look out!

18:32.820 --> 18:34.279
Man down!

18:47.293 --> 18:50.086
Cease fire! They're pulling
back! They're pulling back!

18:50.171 --> 18:51.421
Frak!

18:51.547 --> 18:53.215
Gods damn it!

18:55.384 --> 18:56.635
APOLLO: Come on!

18:57.220 --> 18:58.595
Damn it.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.222
Frak, frak.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.557
(EXCLAIMS)

19:02.642 --> 19:04.518
Okay, this man's dead.
We gotta pull him back.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.728
Sam, pull it together.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.531
APOLLO: All right, we bought
ourselves a little time,

19:17.615 --> 19:19.324
but they'll be back
and with force,

19:19.408 --> 19:20.867
so dig in.

19:20.952 --> 19:23.787
We'll need to hold them off
until Chief finds the Eye.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.665
And keep your eyes out
on those ridges.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.347
You have any word
from Kara or Dee?

19:42.932 --> 19:44.099
No.

20:34.525 --> 20:36.192
Dee, why the hell
didn't you sing out?

20:36.277 --> 20:38.153
I almost blew you away.

It's okay, yeah.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.474
Lee sent you?

21:07.558 --> 21:08.600
Yep.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.185
My husband

21:10.895 --> 21:13.521
ordered me to risk
my life for yours.

21:14.023 --> 21:15.690
That's what I'm gonna do.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.526
I'm gonna bring Starbuck
back to Apollo.

(HERA CRYING)

21:27.411 --> 21:28.828
She's here.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.220
It's me.

21:46.514 --> 21:49.182
It's Mommy. Yes.

21:49.392 --> 21:50.892
What's wrong?

21:53.062 --> 21:55.855
We tried everything.
She didn't respond.

21:56.732 --> 21:59.234
Look at that.
Hera knows her.

22:00.611 --> 22:04.739
That's amazing. You and she
are biologically identical.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.827
But Hera recognizes
her mother.

22:11.247 --> 22:14.541
Well, good, because you can
have her. I'm done with her.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.835
You don't mean that.

22:16.919 --> 22:19.879
I know you still care
about Tyrol and Adama.

22:20.715 --> 22:21.756
No.

22:22.550 --> 22:25.051
I'm done with that
part of my life.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.388
I learnt that
on New Caprica.

22:28.472 --> 22:31.433
Humans and Cylons were
not meant to be together.

22:31.517 --> 22:34.060
We should just go
our separate ways.

22:37.732 --> 22:39.315
Wanna lay down?

22:45.322 --> 22:49.909
Her belly's as hard as a rock.
Have you noticed that before?

22:51.120 --> 22:52.954
(HERA CRYING)

22:53.956 --> 22:55.498
What do you think
that means?

22:55.583 --> 22:57.959
Blocked intestine, maybe.

22:58.252 --> 22:59.878
Our doctors examined her.

22:59.962 --> 23:03.256
Well, your doctors have
never examined a child.

23:06.177 --> 23:08.928
Hera needs to be seen
by a human doctor.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.598
I need to take her
back to Galactica.

23:11.682 --> 23:15.643
You know that can't happen,
what this child means to us.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.562
What she means
to every living Cylon.

23:17.646 --> 23:21.274
I should have known. She's
been planning this all along.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.651
Feel her.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.160
She's right.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.913
Belly's as hard as a gourd.

23:34.997 --> 23:39.709
If you don't let me take her, the
first of a new generation will die.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.962
God will never
forgive you.

23:43.339 --> 23:44.964
Maybe Cavil's right.

23:45.049 --> 23:48.051
Maybe God never wanted us to
have children in the first place.

23:48.135 --> 23:51.346
Maybe it'd be better for you if
I just snapped your little neck!

23:54.850 --> 23:56.101
Don't!

23:59.980 --> 24:01.314

I believe the future of the

24:33.222 --> 24:35.932
and the others
who are gonna come after her.

24:36.016 --> 24:37.559
So do I.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.644
There's a captured
Raptor aboard.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.020
Let's go.

24:41.105 --> 24:43.773
We've gotta get you
back to Galactica.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.556
The Cylons are closing in!

25:16.932 --> 25:18.433
It's the Major.

25:18.642 --> 25:21.186
Tyrol. Tell me you've
found the Eye of Jupiter.

25:21.270 --> 25:22.437
No, but I'm getting close,
Major.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.938
I've deciphered some
more of the glyphs.

25:24.023 --> 25:28.026
I got a reference to an eye, something
about a star, and an explosion of some kind.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.528
All right, cut to the chase, Chief.

25:30.613 --> 25:33.072
Do you have the Eye of Jupiter
in your hands or not?

25:33.157 --> 25:34.532
No, Major.

That's it!

25:39.622 --> 25:41.039
It's hot!

25:46.879 --> 25:48.713
All right, Chief,
listen to me. That's it!

25:49.131 --> 25:51.716
Get your people to the rally
point and blow the Temple.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.718
I repeat, blow the Temple.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.345
Yes, sir. Damn it.

25:55.429 --> 25:56.721
All right, fall back!

Fall back! Fall back!

26:04.355 --> 26:06.981
All right, that's it, everybody.
Drop what you're doing and get out.

2: All right, take that one.

If I only had a little more time. Galen.

It's in the hands of the
Gods now, okay? Let's go.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.837
There's nothing we can do!

26:44.603 --> 26:47.605
The ship's structurally intact. Okay.

26:49.149 --> 26:52.318
That means that the only thing keeping
us grounded is a busted fly-by wire.

26:52.403 --> 26:53.528
So...

26:54.905 --> 26:59.075
You gotta bypass those bundles
with data cord from the com system.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.618
And then we...

27:00.703 --> 27:03.538
We may have a shot
at getting out of here.

27:05.416 --> 27:06.708
(GRUNTING)

27:22.433 --> 27:24.309
There's only one left.

Better save it for
when you fly us out of here.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.564
I can't fly.

whacked up on morph.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.036
He's too honorable.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.495
Unlike you.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.417
Yeah, unlike me.

27:54.631 --> 27:57.133
I love Lee. I hate Lee.

27:57.760 --> 28:01.763

keep the pieces all nice and neat.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.642
Stay with it.

28:07.436 --> 28:10.521
You still gotta walk me
through these avionics.

Temple. Chief, what's your status?

28:14.485 --> 28:16.736
I'm wiring
the last detonator.

D'ANNA: The Eye of Jupiter has
to be somewhere in this Temple.

with explosives.

28:30.959 --> 28:32.752

Pull out the detonators.
Quickly.

Yes?

28:58.070 --> 28:59.237
Help us!

29:01.323 --> 29:02.365
Yeah.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.827

What have you done?

29:25.139 --> 29:26.681
Major, look.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.518
What is that?

29:39.194 --> 29:40.778
There it is, Gaius.

29:40.863 --> 29:43.531
It has the answers
to all of your questions.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.453
That's the Eye?

29:49.329 --> 29:50.621
D'ANNA: What is?

29:50.706 --> 29:51.706
Oh, uh...

29:54.418 --> 29:56.669
Something the Hybrid said...

29:57.880 --> 29:59.589
Sapphire blue

29:59.673 --> 30:01.632
shining like unto a star.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.176
D'Anna...

30:04.636 --> 30:06.596
You didn't come here
looking for Earth.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.474
You came here looking
for something else.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.315
Picking up massive energy
pulse from the central star.

30:17.399 --> 30:20.568
Sir, it's a helium flash.
The star's going nova.

30:21.278 --> 30:25.198
Nova's gonna obliterate the
entire planet in less than an hour.

30:29.745 --> 30:31.204
Major, look.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.830
It's the mandala
from the Temple.

30:32.915 --> 30:35.333
This is supposed
to be happening.

30:35.417 --> 30:36.709
That's it.

30:36.793 --> 30:39.295
I was staring at it
the whole time.

30:39.922 --> 30:41.881
The sun is going nova.

30:42.925 --> 30:45.218
The nova is
the Eye of Jupiter.

30:47.596 --> 30:51.015
All right, we can still blow
it. We can still blow it.

30:57.439 --> 31:00.691
We just gotta make it into orbit.
Galactica will find us from there, okay?

31:01.318 --> 31:02.360
Okay.

31:05.614 --> 31:06.906
Good.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.829
This is my destiny.

31:14.790 --> 31:17.750
To see what lies
between life and death.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.962
And to look upon
the faces of the Final Five.

31:21.505 --> 31:23.297
That can't happen.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.300
This is my destiny.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.182
Sorry, D'Anna.

32:57.559 --> 32:58.601
You.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.107
Forgive me, I...
I had no idea.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.120
No idea about what?

33:18.246 --> 33:20.247
What did you see? What...

33:28.799 --> 33:30.299
Who was it?

33:32.636 --> 33:34.512
So beautiful...

33:35.180 --> 33:36.430
What was?

33:37.182 --> 33:39.183
Tell me! Am I one of you?

33:39.267 --> 33:40.768
You were right.

33:41.436 --> 33:42.812
About what?

33:43.438 --> 33:45.189
D'Anna, did you
see my face?

33:45.273 --> 33:46.565
I have to know, please.

33:46.650 --> 33:49.568
Please, stay with me.
Stay, I have to know!

33:50.445 --> 33:53.531
Tell me, I have to know!
Did you see my face?

33:55.992 --> 33:57.451
Am I a Cylon?

33:58.412 --> 33:59.495
Frak.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.590
God, tell me the truth
before I die.

34:13.176 --> 34:15.302
Welcome home,
Mr. President.

34:31.361 --> 34:33.904
Admiral, the Cylon fleet
just jumped away.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.741
They don't wanna be here when
that nova shock front gets here.

34:36.825 --> 34:37.908
Neither do we.

34:37.993 --> 34:39.452
Launch a rescue
mission, now.

34:39.536 --> 34:42.747
We don't have much time before the
nova fries everything in the system.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.498
It's gonna be
a photo finish.

35:14.404 --> 35:16.572
HOSHI: All rescue ships
from the planet accounted for.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.032
Count us down!

35:18.116 --> 35:20.451
Commence FTL.
HOSHI: Commencing FTL.

35:20.535 --> 35:24.079
GAETA:
Jump in three, two, one...

35:44.851 --> 35:46.101
I got it.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.248
He's not dead?
No, unfortunately.

36:08.083 --> 36:10.042
Take him to the brig.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.223
Sharon!

37:17.986 --> 37:19.278
Hi.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.405
We have to get her
to Doc Cottle right away.

37:21.489 --> 37:22.615
Okay?
Okay.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.325
Stick up!

37:25.327 --> 37:27.745
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire.

37:27.829 --> 37:30.831
She helped us escape.
Get out of the way!

37:30.916 --> 37:32.374
Lieutenant.

37:33.501 --> 37:34.877
Sharon...

38:01.321 --> 38:02.321
(BEEPING)

38:03.782 --> 38:05.866
I think the Chief
is right.

38:07.702 --> 38:11.789
I think the nova does look like
the mandala inside of this Temple.

38:13.833 --> 38:17.753
Do you think the Thirteenth Tribe
had a vision of what was to come?

38:19.422 --> 38:21.006
I don't know what else
it could mean.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.884
Maybe they saw another nova,
and drew a picture of that.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.928
You've seen one nova,
you've seen them all.

38:26.012 --> 38:28.097
Well, there was another nova.

38:29.641 --> 38:35.646
Seen 4,000 years ago, around about
when the Temple might have been built.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.940
It's 13,000 light years
from our present position.

38:38.024 --> 38:41.110
It's a cloud of gas
known as the lonian Nebula.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.241
Maybe it was a road sign

38:48.868 --> 38:51.954
showing the direction
that they headed to next.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.336
So, Starbuck,
is that what you gotta do

38:59.421 --> 39:01.714
to get a little actual
rack time around here?

39:01.798 --> 39:03.507
Did you just come by
to frak with me?

39:03.591 --> 39:06.677
Actually, I wanted to know
if you had any...

39:06.761 --> 39:09.638
pictures of your old
apartment on Caprica.

39:10.515 --> 39:11.890
Um...

39:13.059 --> 39:14.476
Yeah. Uh...

39:15.603 --> 39:17.855
The locker, top shelf.
Cigar box.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.443
Why?

39:22.777 --> 39:24.945
I'm curious
about something.

39:25.822 --> 39:28.032
Well, I hope you and Sharon
aren't planning on redecorating,

39:28.116 --> 39:31.660
'cause you're not gonna get any
bright ideas from my old place.

39:31.745 --> 39:33.120
I remember.

39:33.455 --> 39:35.122
I've seen better looking
train wrecks.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.540
Thank you.

39:38.293 --> 39:41.128
But I do remember
those paintings you did.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.301
STARBUCK:
What about them?

40:04.319 --> 40:08.238
This was on the Temple.

40:08.323 --> 40:11.075
Where'd you get the idea
to paint yours?

40:11.993 --> 40:13.702
I don't know.

40:13.787 --> 40:16.288
It was just something I've
been doodling since I was a kid.

40:16.372 --> 40:18.248
I liked the pattern.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.127
Well...

40:23.296 --> 40:25.881
They built the Temple
4,000 years ago.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.469
What is it?

40:34.682 --> 40:37.017
Just something
Leoben said once.

40:41.022 --> 40:42.856
That I had a destiny.

40:47.153 --> 40:49.530
That it had already
been written.

40:57.330 --> 40:58.705
(GROANING)

41:02.043 --> 41:03.710
You know the drill.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.880
Long, deep,
controlled breathing.

41:13.888 --> 41:17.141
At least you'll never
have to go through this again.

41:17.225 --> 41:21.228
The decision wasn't easy, but
the conclusion was inevitable.

41:23.231 --> 41:25.732
Your model is
fundamentally flawed.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.527
No.

41:32.907 --> 41:35.325
It's not a flaw
to question our purpose.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.536
Is it?

41:37.620 --> 41:40.831
To wonder who programmed us,
the way we think and why?

41:40.915 --> 41:42.958
Well, that's the problem
right there.

41:43.042 --> 41:47.421
The messianic conviction that you're
on a special mission to enlighten us.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.423
Look at the damage
it's caused.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.383
I would do it all again.

41:51.467 --> 41:52.551
Yes, we know.

41:52.635 --> 41:55.179
That's why we've decided to

41:55.263 --> 41:57.097
box your entire line.

41:57.599 --> 42:01.810
Your consciousness, memory,
every thought your model ever had

42:03.396 --> 42:05.397
are going into cold storage.

42:05.481 --> 42:06.523
Indefinitely.

42:06.608 --> 42:08.901
One must die
to know the truth.

42:09.194 --> 42:11.778
There are five
other Cylons, Brother.

42:12.655 --> 42:14.031
I saw them.

42:17.619 --> 42:20.245
One day, you're gonna see them, too.

42:22.123 --> 42:23.332
One day.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.417
Good-bye.

42:27.462 --> 42:28.837
Brother...

42:30.798 --> 42:32.090
Brother...

42:32.800 --> 42:33.800
(BEEPS)

42:33.885 --> 42:35.260
Brother...

43:06.542 --> 43:08.210
