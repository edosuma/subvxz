00:06.702 --> 00:09.052
- I can't believe
Myrtle's gone.

00:09.096 --> 00:12.664
- Yeah, she was so sweet,
and lived through so much.

00:12.708 --> 00:15.493
Her e-mail address
was from Yahoo.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.234
- When I first hired
Myrtle to be my assistant,

00:17.278 --> 00:20.324
she used to leave loose
hot dogs on my desk every day.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.152
I think she thought
I'd asked for that,

00:22.196 --> 00:24.676
but she just really cared.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.330
- She did.

00:26.374 --> 00:27.679
And she was really getting

00:27.723 --> 00:29.638
a lot less racist
towards the end.

00:29.681 --> 00:30.813
all: Yeah.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.380
- She still called me
Moana sometimes,

00:32.423 --> 00:34.295
but at least she saw the movie.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.123
Representation matters.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.472
- All right, Glenn,
I got it all cued up.

00:37.515 --> 00:39.082
- Oh, good.

00:39.126 --> 00:41.476
We still have the projection
from Myrtle's virtual greeter,

00:41.519 --> 00:43.608
so I thought it'd be nice
to see her again.

00:43.652 --> 00:46.307
- Oh, like when Tupac
played Coachella.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.222
- Welcome to Cloud 9.

00:48.265 --> 00:49.571
all: Aww.

00:49.614 --> 00:53.662
- Check out our great deals
on batteries.

00:53.705 --> 00:57.187
Check out our great deals
on sporting goods.

00:58.623 --> 01:03.237
- Check out our great deals
on paper products.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.716
- How many of these
do we have to watch

01:04.760 --> 01:06.153
so we're not bad people?

01:06.196 --> 01:08.503
- I'm gonna say ten.
- Avocados.

01:14.857 --> 01:17.164
- Feels kind of weird
just going back to work, huh?

01:17.207 --> 01:18.904
- Yeah.
Should we just call it?

01:18.948 --> 01:21.385
- No, we can just think
about Myrtle while we work.

01:21.429 --> 01:22.865
- Great, now I gotta
do two things.

01:22.908 --> 01:25.259
- Hey, guys,
Myrtle's nephew just came in

01:25.302 --> 01:27.609
and dropped off this envelope
they found in her stuff,

01:27.652 --> 01:30.568
and it's addressed
to "Sweet Prince Jonah"

01:30.612 --> 01:31.569
from Cloud 9.

01:31.613 --> 01:32.570
- Wow.

01:32.614 --> 01:33.919
- And she meant me?

01:33.963 --> 01:36.139
I mean, I played a prince

01:36.183 --> 01:37.358
in "Into the Woods"
in high school,

01:37.401 --> 01:38.533
but there's no way
she could've--

01:38.576 --> 01:39.838
I don't know why this--

01:39.882 --> 01:41.362
- There's 1,000 bucks in it.
I already opened it.

01:41.405 --> 01:42.537
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:42.580 --> 01:45.888
For Jonah?
Were you guys even close?

01:45.931 --> 01:48.325
- She never mentioned that when
I made her tea every morning,

01:48.369 --> 01:50.414
or when I took her
to her doctor's appointments.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.764
- I mean, I was nice to her,
but, you know,

01:52.808 --> 01:55.593
like a regular amount of nice.

01:55.637 --> 01:56.768
- And she fell
right into your trap.

01:56.812 --> 01:58.161
- There was no trap.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.380
- It's the way of the world.
The rich get richer.

01:59.423 --> 02:00.642
- Who's rich?

02:00.685 --> 02:02.383
- How many cruises
did you go on as a kid?

02:02.426 --> 02:05.386
- That's not the point.

02:05.429 --> 02:07.518
Sure, I grew up comfortable,

02:07.562 --> 02:10.260
but now I have tons student
loan and credit card debts.

02:10.304 --> 02:12.871
Look, guys, I have no idea
why she gave me the money,

02:12.915 --> 02:15.396
and I'm just saying
I'm not the spoiled wealthy guy

02:15.439 --> 02:16.875
you all see me as.

02:16.919 --> 02:19.748
- I mean, you did start
working in retail on a whim.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.271
- Can you back me up here,
please?

02:21.315 --> 02:22.881
- Why?
You're doing great.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.711
- ♪ Tell me who to be

02:26.755 --> 02:28.452
♪ Who died

02:28.496 --> 02:32.369
♪ And made you
king of anything? ♪

02:34.676 --> 02:35.807
- Hey, Dina.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.810
Are you mad at something
far way?

02:38.854 --> 02:40.464
- Just thinking about Myrtle.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.640
I always meant to tell her how
much I admired her work ethic.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.207
I mean, she didn't know
what she was doing,

02:44.251 --> 02:45.991
but, man, could she randomly
move things around.

02:46.035 --> 02:48.211
- Yeah.
I miss her, too.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.518
We used to go to the same water
aerobics class at the gym.

02:50.561 --> 02:52.215
- I don't want to picture
your hair wet.

02:52.259 --> 02:55.349
- We wear swim caps.
- Sandra, please.

02:55.392 --> 02:58.526
It's just, when someone dies,
it...

02:58.569 --> 03:00.005
brings up a whole lot
of regrets, you know?

03:00.049 --> 03:01.485
Makes you think about
all the things you wish

03:01.529 --> 03:03.792
you could've done differently.

03:03.835 --> 03:05.402
It's really been making me
think about my dad.

03:05.446 --> 03:08.362
- Aww. Yeah, maybe you should
reconnect before it's too late.

03:08.405 --> 03:09.624
- Oh, God, no.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.408
I want him to feel
this kind of regret.

03:11.452 --> 03:13.715
I wanna cause him the pain
that he caused me.

03:13.758 --> 03:17.936
- I started smiling
before I heard what you said.

03:19.982 --> 03:22.724
- Hey, Glenn,
how you holding up?

03:22.767 --> 03:25.683
Not great.

03:25.727 --> 03:29.296
I found a snail
in my car this morning,

03:29.339 --> 03:30.862
and I didn't even name him.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.690
I didn't have it in me.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.866
- Yeah, that's--that's rough.

03:34.910 --> 03:37.869
Hey, you know, I was watching

03:37.913 --> 03:40.959
the weather this morning,
and it was so crazy.

03:41.003 --> 03:43.310
The guy was talking about
a cold front

03:43.353 --> 03:45.790
off the coast of Myrtle Beach.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.227
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:47.270 --> 03:50.360
Yeah, he said Myrtle,
like, five times, you know?

03:50.404 --> 03:51.753
Who knows?
Maybe--

03:51.796 --> 03:54.886
maybe it's a sign, you know,
that she's, um--

03:54.930 --> 03:56.888
she'll always be here with us.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.282
- Yeah.

03:59.326 --> 04:01.502
Or maybe she's trying
to communicate with us.

04:01.545 --> 04:03.721
- Yeah, or that was just
the whole message.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.421
- What's--
- Jonah.

04:07.464 --> 04:09.684
Ketchup packets.
- Uh--

04:09.727 --> 04:11.903
- Myrtle loved to eat
ketchup packets.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.905
- Is love the right word
for what that was?

04:13.949 --> 04:15.472
- This could be a sign.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.952
- I don't think--

04:16.995 --> 04:18.954
- My eyes are open, Myrtle!

04:20.434 --> 04:22.610
- This lipstick
is stay all day,

04:22.653 --> 04:24.916
all organic, and only $13.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.917
Cash only.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.658
Just put the money
on the counter,

04:27.702 --> 04:29.704
and then I'll shake your hand
with the lipstick in my palm.

04:29.747 --> 04:33.577
- Um, I really just popped in
for chunk salmon and water.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.405
- Okay.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.407
- You're selling
bootleg makeup.

04:37.451 --> 04:38.669
- Shh.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.715
Corona turned me on
to her little side hustle

04:40.758 --> 04:43.674
selling this makeup,
and she's been making bank.

04:43.718 --> 04:46.024
She keeps Instagramming herself
rolling around in money.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.765
- Ew. Money is filthy.

04:47.809 --> 04:50.072
- Yeah, she got
a staph infection from it,

04:50.115 --> 04:52.466
but she can afford
mad antibiotics now.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.815
- Lucy May?

04:53.858 --> 04:54.946
Cheyenne,
I've heard about this.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.339
This is a pyramid scheme.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.907
- No, no, no, it's called
multi-level marketing.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.475
The different levels get smaller
and smaller as you go up.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.520
It's kind of shaped
like a triangle.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.782
- Trust me.
It's a scam.

05:04.826 --> 05:05.914
It'll just make
your money problems worse.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.437
- But it's so easy.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.700
I just recruit people,
and then I get a cut.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.876
It's like I'm a makeup pimp.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.618
- Oh, Garrett, do you want
to try some hand lotion?

05:14.662 --> 05:16.446
- Nah, not really
a hand lotion guy.

05:16.490 --> 05:17.882
Yeah, obviously.

05:17.926 --> 05:20.363
- Okay, well, if you're
gonna be rude, come on.

05:20.407 --> 05:21.886
- Oh, all right.

05:25.673 --> 05:28.371
Now just watch
the money roll in.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.417
- I can't be the guy
that keeps this money, right?

05:30.460 --> 05:31.809
I don't even know why
I have it.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.202
- 'Cause you're
the sweet prince.

05:33.245 --> 05:36.074
-  I'm just gonna
give it back to the family.

05:36.118 --> 05:38.512
Then they'll have the money
and everyone here will know

05:38.555 --> 05:40.775
that I'm just like
a regular man of the people.

05:40.818 --> 05:43.778
- The people would never
turn down $1,000.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.388
Everybody here would keep
that money.

05:45.432 --> 05:46.650
Some would try to steal
more of it.

05:46.694 --> 05:48.478
- Okay, well,
then what if I gave it to you?

05:48.522 --> 05:49.958
I mean,
I'm living in your house.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.438
It's the least I can do.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.657
- Yeah, you know, I haven't
wanted to say anything,

05:53.701 --> 05:55.659
but you do owe me,
like, 19 grand,

05:55.703 --> 05:57.139
but I'd prefer
you pay me back in sex.

05:57.182 --> 05:58.575
- Mm, that's a lot of sex.

05:58.619 --> 06:01.099
Okay, well, how about
we just share it, then?

06:01.143 --> 06:03.624
We could spend it
on something nice like a trip.

06:03.667 --> 06:06.409
- Ooh, I have always wanted
to go to Florida.

06:06.453 --> 06:09.499
- Like the Florida
from the news?

06:09.543 --> 06:10.718
- Well, if you ignore
all the people,

06:10.761 --> 06:12.415
it's basically Hawaii.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.852
- So I was able to get my dad's
phone number from his Facebook.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.985
Luckily, old people
still trust the internet.

06:17.028 --> 06:19.074
- Cool.
And I'm here for support.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.772
- No.
You're gonna call him.

06:21.816 --> 06:24.427
Look, my dad--
scum of the earth,

06:24.471 --> 06:26.560
human equivalent
of a Band-Aid in a salad--

06:26.603 --> 06:28.083
left me 23 years ago.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.780
He deserves to suffer.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.826
So you're gonna call him

06:31.869 --> 06:34.916
and tell him you're my friend
Sandra Johnson from work.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.613
- Sandra Johnson?

06:36.657 --> 06:39.616
- Kaluiokalani sounds made-up.
Anyway, just tell him I'm dead.

06:39.660 --> 06:40.878
- What?

06:40.922 --> 06:42.140
- Hello?

06:42.184 --> 06:46.057
- Uh, this is Sandra Johnson.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.886
I work with your daughter Dina
at Cloud 9,

06:48.930 --> 06:53.935
and I just wanted to tell you
that Dina...

06:53.978 --> 06:55.153
passed away.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.807
- What?

06:56.851 --> 06:59.549
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
She's dead.

06:59.593 --> 07:03.553
- Oh, God.

07:03.597 --> 07:06.513
- Actually, she's not dead.

07:06.556 --> 07:07.862
- What?
- Nope.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.516
She's dying.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.908
-  Dead.
Fully dead.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.562
- The doctor said
she stabilized

07:12.606 --> 07:14.999
and she might pull through.

07:15.043 --> 07:17.567
But I think they were just
trying to be nice.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.569
They seemed like liars.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.745
- I'm sorry, what are you--

07:21.789 --> 07:22.964
- Damn it, Sandra.

07:23.007 --> 07:24.748
If you can't even
convince my dad I'm dead,

07:24.792 --> 07:26.794
what the hell can you do?

07:29.492 --> 07:30.711
- Right there.
Great.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.147
Hi, Sandra?

07:32.190 --> 07:33.496
Sandra Johnson?

07:33.540 --> 07:34.715
- Yes?

07:34.758 --> 07:36.020
- Yeah, we talked earlier
on the phone.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.761
I'm Dina's dad, Howard.

07:37.805 --> 07:40.024
I--I called the number back and
they gave me the store address.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.591
The app said it was
a 47-minute drive.

07:41.635 --> 07:44.028
I made it in 40 flat.
- Congrats.

07:44.072 --> 07:46.074
- Our conversation left me with
more than a few questions.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.468
I mean, she's dead?
She's dying--

07:48.511 --> 07:52.210
- Sir, the truth is,
Dina's fine.

07:52.254 --> 07:55.605
She wanted me to fake her death
to make you feel bad.

07:58.042 --> 08:00.262
- Well, I guess, uh,

08:00.305 --> 08:02.003
can't say I don't deserve it.

08:02.046 --> 08:05.659
I'm no golden jackal
when it comes to parenting.

08:05.702 --> 08:09.271
They're incredible fathers.
Is Dina in the store?

08:09.314 --> 08:13.667
- Yes, but small heads-up.
She's very angry.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.407
If she goes for a choke hold,

08:15.451 --> 08:18.628
it's best to just pretend
you've passed out, okay?

08:20.064 --> 08:21.718
- Dad?

08:28.420 --> 08:30.466
- Now that everything's
out in the open,

08:30.510 --> 08:32.163
my name isn't actually
Sandra Johnson.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.122
It's Sandra Kaluiokalani.

08:34.165 --> 08:36.516
- Yeah, sure it is.

08:36.559 --> 08:39.388
- "Florida man cuts nose off
with samurai sword."

08:39.431 --> 08:41.651
- We're going
to the other coast.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.566
- Jonah, look.

08:43.610 --> 08:46.047
I was just in softlines,
and then suddenly,

08:46.090 --> 08:47.396
out of nowhere, boom.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.485
This bottle
of Mr. Clean appeared.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.313
Myrtle always said
that Mr. Clean

08:51.356 --> 08:52.749
was her celebrity crush.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.143
She called him,
"My big white genie."

08:55.186 --> 08:58.538
- Oh, yeah.
That sounds familiar, I think.

08:58.581 --> 09:01.323
- Look, I know she means well
leaving all these signs

09:01.366 --> 09:02.716
to let me know
she's still around,

09:02.759 --> 09:06.067
but it just makes me
miss her more.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.460
You shouldn't outlive
your employees.

09:08.504 --> 09:11.028
It's not right.
It's not natural.

09:11.072 --> 09:14.336
- You know what, Glenn?
You should take the money.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.381
- What?
- Really?

09:16.425 --> 09:20.211
- Yeah, you were so close
with Myrtle and you deserve it.

09:20.255 --> 09:22.170
She wrote my name
on the envelope,

09:22.213 --> 09:24.302
but who knows who she
could've meant, you know?

09:24.346 --> 09:26.261
Could've been you.

09:26.304 --> 09:29.307
- Oh, my God.
Thank you.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.527
You know, I think
you giving me this money

09:31.571 --> 09:33.703
is another sign from Myrtle.

09:33.747 --> 09:36.750
- Or maybe it's just a nice
thing that I'm doing but enjoy.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.534
It's yours.

09:40.275 --> 09:43.234
- The colors are packaged
so you know they go together.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.627
It takes out
all the think work.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.716
- I could use
a little less think work.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.675
I'll take one.

09:48.718 --> 09:51.591
Thank you, baby.
- Mm-hmm.

09:51.634 --> 09:54.376
- Wait, you made
all that money today?

09:54.419 --> 09:58.380
- Uh-huh, and this may push me
to Lucy May diamond level.

09:58.423 --> 10:00.817
Once you hit diamond,
they send you a sweet hoodie.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.471
Well, it's a hoodie.

10:02.514 --> 10:04.865
- Hey, Cheyenne,
that stuff you gave me,

10:04.908 --> 10:06.388
the lotion or whatever?

10:06.431 --> 10:08.303
- Isn't it the best?
And it makes your hands

10:08.346 --> 10:10.305
smell like you just washed them
with Hawaiian Punch.

10:10.348 --> 10:11.436
- You know, I could just, like,

10:11.480 --> 10:13.525
buy a bottle
if it'll help you out.

10:13.569 --> 10:15.136
- Really, Garrett?
You're buying Lucy May?

10:15.179 --> 10:17.225
- Yeah, to help Cheyenne.

10:17.268 --> 10:20.141
Plus, feel my hands.
They're soft like puppy fur.

10:21.403 --> 10:22.796
- I've never
touched you before.

10:22.839 --> 10:24.798
It's weird.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.887
- It's been a while since
I've been in a store like this.

10:26.930 --> 10:30.586
I just get everything from Jed.
He's my neighbor and a hoarder.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.675
- Convenient.
- Yeah.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.590
Look,

10:34.634 --> 10:37.462
for what it's worth,
when I left you that day,

10:37.506 --> 10:39.595
I was a different man
than I am now.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.424
I was young and stupid,

10:42.467 --> 10:46.341
and I had this dream
of selling belt buckle knives.

10:48.256 --> 10:49.649
And I made that dream come true.

10:49.692 --> 10:52.260
- Wait, that was in there
this whole time?

10:52.303 --> 10:53.478
Wow.

10:53.522 --> 10:56.438
- Fast as lightning,
but sharper.

10:56.481 --> 10:59.310
But I can't forgive myself
for leaving you for it.

10:59.354 --> 11:03.314
I watched this belt buckle go
from prototype to market ready,

11:03.358 --> 11:06.187
but I didn't see you go from
pre-teen to tall lady,

11:06.230 --> 11:07.797
and, uh,

11:07.841 --> 11:11.366
well, that's not okay.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.629
- Well, I think
it's water under the bridge.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.109
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:15.152 --> 11:17.285
Okay, I think I should show
you around 'cause this store

11:17.328 --> 11:19.504
is kind of like my own
personal belt buckle knife,

11:19.548 --> 11:22.290
though not nearly
as surprising or cool.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.726
- Look, I know why you did it.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.902
It's just that we talked about
maybe sharing the money.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.556
- No, you're right.
You're right.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.079
- I just hope that
you don't go around

11:29.123 --> 11:30.646
giving away chunks of our money
for the rest of our lives.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.169
- Rest of our lives, huh?
- What?

11:32.213 --> 11:34.215
No, I meant, like,
for the rest of, like,

11:34.258 --> 11:35.651
however long this is.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.218
- No, I get it.

11:37.261 --> 11:38.785
Yeah, however long this is,
which if you have your way,

11:38.828 --> 11:40.569
will be 1 million years.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.049
- Oh, shut up.

11:42.092 --> 11:44.791
- Jonah, Amy, I just got off
the phone with Pastor Craig,

11:44.834 --> 11:47.881
and we've decided what I'm
gonna do with Myrtle's money.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.797
- Oh,
you and Pastor Craig decided?

11:50.840 --> 11:52.799
- Yeah, he said
that all the signs

11:52.842 --> 11:54.670
that Myrtle has been leaving me

11:54.714 --> 11:56.933
means that she hasn't
ascended into heaven yet.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.980
But luckily for us,
Pastor Craig can get her in.

12:00.023 --> 12:02.243
- Wow, that is lucky.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.549
- Yeah, it turns out
that the amount of money

12:04.593 --> 12:06.682
that Myrtle left
is the exact same amount

12:06.726 --> 12:09.772
that she needs
to get into heaven.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.905
I mean, tell me
that's not a miracle.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.522
- Ugh.
What a waste of money.

12:20.565 --> 12:21.653
We would spend it
so much better.

12:21.697 --> 12:22.916
I still love the idea
of a vacation.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.787
- Wow, you're really stuck
on this vacation thing.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.397
If there's something
you're planning on asking me--

12:26.441 --> 12:27.572
- I hate this.
Please stop!

12:27.616 --> 12:28.748
- You can do it
right here in town.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.838
- ♪ Just once

12:31.881 --> 12:36.538
♪ Can't we figure out
what we keep doing wrong? ♪

12:38.888 --> 12:40.716
♪ Why the good times nev--

12:40.760 --> 12:42.805
- Dina, have you seen Glenn?

12:42.849 --> 12:44.024
- Not for a while.
I've been lucky.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.677
- Thanks.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.027
The staff bathroom's cool,
right, Dad?

12:47.070 --> 12:48.855
I use it all the time.
No big deal.

12:48.898 --> 12:51.945
Oh, Dad, this is my boss, Amy.
Show her your belt buckle.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.077
- Oh, my God.
This is--oh, Jesus.

12:54.121 --> 12:55.687
- Fast as lightning,
but sharper.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.473
- Amy, why don't you
tell my dad about

12:58.516 --> 12:59.909
how I'm doing
as assistant manager?

12:59.953 --> 13:03.086
- Um--oh, yeah, she is great.

13:03.130 --> 13:08.613
She's hard-working
and dedicated

13:08.657 --> 13:12.661
and, um, uh, very--
very serious about security.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.141
She tackled a guy.

13:14.184 --> 13:15.185
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.057
Yeah, I think
broke his nose or--

13:17.100 --> 13:19.059
- His jaw.
Yeah, it's all part of the job.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.625
I mean, you can be
super proud if you want,

13:20.669 --> 13:21.844
but that's your call.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.672
Thanks, Amy.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.892
- Okay, I want in.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.545
You're obviously
making a lot of money,

13:27.589 --> 13:28.851
and you know
I can make you even more.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.461
Plus, I'm dating
the manager's brother,

13:30.505 --> 13:32.681
so I'm basically
the first lady of the store.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.726
- Wouldn't Jonah be
the first lady of the store--

13:34.770 --> 13:36.598
- Okay, it doesn't matter.

13:36.641 --> 13:39.035
The vision center sucks,
and I need money.

13:39.079 --> 13:42.734
I'm running out of options,
so please put me on the team.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.084
- Okay, you're in.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.737
I'll get you some product
to get you started.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.696
- Yes!
Chateo back in business.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.787
What?
- Chateo.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.702
It's the business
that we were gonna start.

13:53.745 --> 13:56.836
- Oh, I don't remember
a lot of things we talk about.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.100
- Hey, buddy.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.623
- Oh, hey, Amy.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.844
Is it okay if I step out
to do a wire transfer?

14:04.887 --> 14:06.846
Pastor Craig's
on Lake Como time.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.936
- Uh-huh, maybe.
Look, Glenn, I was thinking.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.503
When was the last time
that you got Jerusha

14:12.547 --> 14:14.114
something really nice?

14:14.157 --> 14:18.248
- Oh, I bought her a bone-in
parma ham last Monday.

14:18.292 --> 14:20.250
As far as she's concerned,
that's as good as it gets.

14:20.294 --> 14:24.646
- Uh, because we just thought
it's kind of a lot of money

14:24.689 --> 14:26.735
to be giving to Pastor Craig.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.215
- I thought so too at first,

14:28.258 --> 14:30.870
but then Pastor Craig
told me about all the extras.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.306
- Extras?
- Yeah.

14:32.349 --> 14:35.613
Like for $600,
Myrtle can get into heaven,

14:35.657 --> 14:38.225
but it's, you know,
regular heaven, economy class.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.140
But for the thousand,

14:40.183 --> 14:42.185
she can get into
first-class heaven.

14:42.229 --> 14:44.666
I mean, I bet that's where
the saints hang out.

14:44.709 --> 14:48.539
- Okay, Glenn,
we're not saying that--

14:48.583 --> 14:50.150
it's just that--
- You can't have the money.

14:50.193 --> 14:51.934
- What?

14:51.978 --> 14:53.675
- Dad, this is Garrett.

14:53.718 --> 14:54.806
- Dad?

14:54.850 --> 14:56.591
Oh, wow, okay.
Nice to meet you.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.027
- Yeah.
- Garrett killed all my birds.

14:58.071 --> 14:59.768
- Oh, well--
- Then he had sex with me.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.989
- Okay.
- Wow. Busy guy.

15:03.032 --> 15:05.078
Smell like Hawaiian Punch here?

15:05.121 --> 15:07.863
- Oh, yeah.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.821
What is that?

15:09.865 --> 15:11.649
- We heard about you two--

15:11.693 --> 15:14.087
about how you don't want Myrtle
to have a good afterlife.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.305
- What?
No.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.873
We want her to have
the best afterlife.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.005
- Oh, I see.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.224
So you want Myrtle
to get into heaven.

15:21.268 --> 15:22.878
You just don't want
to pay for it.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.140
- It's how rich guys stay rich.

15:24.184 --> 15:25.968
They just hold on
to their money.

15:26.012 --> 15:28.710
No helping nice old ladies
get to heaven.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.277
- Mm-hmm.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.627
- No taking their best friend
out for sushi on his birthday,

15:32.670 --> 15:34.150
even when I made
the reservation.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.196
- You can't assume someone's
taking you out to dinner.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.111
- Yeah, well,
I learned that one the hard way.

15:38.154 --> 15:40.635
- Look, buying your way
into heaven, that's--

15:40.678 --> 15:43.638
that's just not how it works,
and what is that fruity smell?

15:43.681 --> 15:44.726
- I smell it, too.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.206
Definitely coming from
this area.

15:46.249 --> 15:47.555
- We're getting off track here.

15:47.598 --> 15:50.036
Stop complaining about
some random good smell.

15:50.079 --> 15:52.038
- Okay, do you honestly
think that paying

15:52.081 --> 15:55.215
to get Myrtle into heaven
is the best use of this money?

15:55.258 --> 15:56.651
- Yeah.
- If that's what Myrtle wants.

15:56.694 --> 15:59.132
- Okay, well,
if that's how everybody feels,

15:59.175 --> 16:00.785
why don't we all chip in?

16:00.829 --> 16:02.178
- You know what?
Great idea, Amy.

16:02.222 --> 16:06.356
I'll start.
Here's 5 bucks, kay?

16:06.400 --> 16:08.141
- I'm onto you.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.056
- Hey, I'd love to chip in,
but I'm still paying off

16:10.099 --> 16:12.058
that sushi dinner
I had to buy myself.

16:12.101 --> 16:13.407
- Okay, all right,
Marcus is a pass.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.757
Justine?
- I've just got big bills on me.

16:15.800 --> 16:19.326
- Oh, come on, everybody.
This is a good cause.

16:19.369 --> 16:21.763
- Yeah, well, so far,
we only have--

16:21.806 --> 16:24.113
wait, where's my five?
Who took my five?

16:24.157 --> 16:25.897
- I don't care what you say.

16:25.941 --> 16:27.769
I'm giving this money
to Pastor Craig.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.205
- You should.
- Good for you, Glenn.

16:29.249 --> 16:30.946
- I'm sorry.
Now I'm smelling the fruit.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.121
Is it coming from over there?

16:32.165 --> 16:34.254
- This is a joke.
We all know who it is.

16:34.297 --> 16:37.735
What we don't know is why.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.999
- Watch this, Dad.
Right in the pocket.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.175
- That's my girl.

16:42.218 --> 16:45.178
Wow!
Sure know how to lift that fork.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.963
Take after your old man.
- You want to try it?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.269
I won't tell
the assistant manager.

16:49.312 --> 16:50.879
I hear she can be
a bit of a hard-ass.

16:50.922 --> 16:54.926
You know something, Dina?

16:54.970 --> 16:57.277
I am really proud
of the woman you've become.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.061
- Thanks, Dad.

16:59.105 --> 17:02.064
- Yeah, I mean,
seeing you today,

17:02.108 --> 17:04.284
I'm starting to think

17:04.327 --> 17:07.069
maybe it was a good thing
that I left.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.680
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
the strong woman you are today.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.858
- Yeah.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.382
I hadn't thought about it
that way.

17:15.425 --> 17:16.818
- All right,
let me try this, all right?

17:16.861 --> 17:18.428
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:18.472 --> 17:21.170
- Yeah!

17:24.608 --> 17:26.349
- Hey, Dina,
your dad's looking for you.

17:26.393 --> 17:27.524
- Uh-huh.

17:27.568 --> 17:30.266
- Uh, so what should I tell him?

17:30.310 --> 17:31.398
- I don't know.

17:31.441 --> 17:32.616
I can't hang out
with my dad all day.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.096
I mean, I have a job.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.620
I have responsibilities
I can't just walk away from

17:36.664 --> 17:38.274
because I feel like it,
you know?

17:38.318 --> 17:39.797
I still have to go through
all the security footage

17:39.841 --> 17:42.539
form this morning, so...

17:42.583 --> 17:45.455
Oh, come on.
Damn it.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.544
- I'll--I'll tell him
you're on a call.

17:49.677 --> 17:53.768
- Don't worry.
I'm in heaven now.

17:53.811 --> 17:56.292
Don't worry.
I'm in heaven now.

17:56.336 --> 17:58.294
- Guys, what is this?

17:58.338 --> 17:59.904
- It just started doing that
a little while ago,

17:59.948 --> 18:01.254
and hasn't stopped.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.560
- Did I hear her say,
"I'm in heaven"?

18:03.604 --> 18:05.345
- Yeah.
Wow, Glenn.

18:05.388 --> 18:08.435
You were totally right
about this signs thing.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.959
I mean...
What a relief.

18:11.002 --> 18:15.485
- Guys, I'm not the chicken
that forgot his hat, okay?

18:15.529 --> 18:18.488
I know you faked this.
- What are you talking about?

18:18.532 --> 18:21.535
- I mean, come on.
The editing is so choppy.

18:21.578 --> 18:22.884
- Okay, my bad.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.842
In the future, I'll be better
at faking miracles.

18:24.886 --> 18:27.193
- Still, it's true.

18:27.236 --> 18:29.238
A nice lady like Myrtle--
I mean, there's no way

18:29.282 --> 18:30.674
she's not getting
into heaven, right?

18:30.718 --> 18:32.459
- Definitely.
- Yes, exactly.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.243
- I mean, it only makes sense.

18:36.289 --> 18:37.942
But I'm still gonna give
the money to Pastor Craig

18:37.986 --> 18:39.553
just to be safe.

18:41.946 --> 18:44.688
- Hey, you're still here.
That's a change of pace for you.

18:44.732 --> 18:47.474
That's a fair joke.

18:47.517 --> 18:49.867
So I was thinking maybe
we could have dinner tonight?

18:49.911 --> 18:52.696
Celebrate our reunion.
You like meatball subs, right?

18:52.740 --> 18:55.308
- I'm a vegan now,
but don't beat yourself up.

18:55.351 --> 18:56.787
It's impossible to know stuff
you weren't around for.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.746
- So we have some
catching up to do.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.661
- No, Dad.

19:00.704 --> 19:04.360
It's too late.
You missed everything.

19:04.404 --> 19:05.883
When I was 13,
I broke my arm so bad,

19:05.927 --> 19:07.842
they gave me my own booth
at the county fair.

19:07.885 --> 19:10.888
I attended multiple
father-daughter dances alone,

19:10.932 --> 19:13.543
and when I was 16,
everyone made fun of me

19:13.587 --> 19:15.241
'cause my dad didn't
buy me my first gun.

19:15.284 --> 19:16.764
Our neighbor Mr. Gianetti did.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.722
- Terry Gianetti
was a stand up guy.

19:18.766 --> 19:21.986
- I had to navigate
all of that without you.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.988
And that may be why
I am so strong,

19:24.032 --> 19:28.079
but I am not gonna let you
take credit for that, okay?

19:28.123 --> 19:29.559
So I think you should leave.

19:29.603 --> 19:30.821
- Oh, come on, Dina.

19:30.865 --> 19:34.085
I mean,
I can't take back what I did.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.914
But I'm here now.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.916
What more do you want me to do?

19:38.960 --> 19:40.570
- Do what I did.

19:40.614 --> 19:42.746
Figure it out.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.403
- I was on fire.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.057
God, it felt so good
to be out there hustling.

19:49.100 --> 19:52.103
- Oh, and we sell a sunscreen
with glitter in it.

19:52.147 --> 19:54.410
Corona cashes in
at music festivals.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.412
- Two words.
Gay pride.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.066
- Well, pride will be here
before you know it,

19:58.109 --> 20:00.416
so let's stock you back up.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.070
- That's a lot of boxes.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.376
- Yeah.

20:03.419 --> 20:06.553
I had to borrow my stepdad's van
to fit the rest.

20:06.596 --> 20:08.859
- The rest?

20:08.903 --> 20:10.948
- Yeah,
so half of this is yours now,

20:10.992 --> 20:12.123
and once we sell all this,

20:12.167 --> 20:15.388
I'll break even
and start making bank.

20:15.431 --> 20:19.087
- Wait, so all that cash
is not profit?

20:19.130 --> 20:20.523
Cheyenne,
it's gonna be ten years

20:20.567 --> 20:21.916
before we make money off this.

20:21.959 --> 20:25.049
- What?
Ten years?

20:25.093 --> 20:28.444
What am I supposed to do
with money in my 30s?

20:30.011 --> 20:30.968
- You know, it's funny
we're putting

20:31.012 --> 20:32.796
Myrtle's picture up there.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.712
Do you know that
in 33 years of working here,

20:35.756 --> 20:38.411
Myrtle was never once
employee of the month?

20:38.454 --> 20:41.327
But when heaven picks
its angel of the month,

20:41.370 --> 20:43.764
I know whose picture
they're gonna hang.

20:43.807 --> 20:45.722
- Do you think
they'll use that picture,

20:45.766 --> 20:47.637
or would it be her as,
like, a baby?

20:47.681 --> 20:49.509
- Or, like,
her in a Halloween costume.

20:49.552 --> 20:52.729
- Anyway, she will be missed.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.949
To Myrtle.
all: To Myrtle.

20:58.082 --> 20:59.562
- What is this?

20:59.606 --> 21:00.998
- This is Myrtle's
favorite drink.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.000
It's called the Rusty Spaniard.

21:03.044 --> 21:05.481
- I didn't realize we had
gazpacho and Everclear.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.399
- Well, it was really nice
to have that money,

21:10.443 --> 21:12.183
even for a short while.

21:12.227 --> 21:13.489
- Yeah, don't worry.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.491
I don't need, like,
a fancy ring.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.667
- Ugh, I want you
out of the house by tomorrow.
