WEBVTT

00:10.766 --> 00:13.633
We went shopping for a whiskey
night the other day.

00:18.333 --> 00:20.766
That's a big fuck‐off bottle
of Gus N' Bru.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.633
It's better to be looking
at it then looking
for it.

00:22.666 --> 00:23.933
You boys getting
into it tonight?

00:23.966 --> 00:25.666
Yeah, it's a Texas‐sized
ten‐four.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.233
That's a Texas‐sized
two‐six.

00:27.266 --> 00:30.366
That's a Texas Micky,
super shooters,
let's get cracking.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.866
Wayne.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.033
What's the problem,
Katy?

00:33.066 --> 00:35.133
It happened again.
What did?

00:35.166 --> 00:37.633
Gus left a Mr. Big
on the floor
this morning.

00:37.666 --> 00:38.966
No, he never.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.400
He dropped a Hershey bar
in the living room
just last Tuesday,

00:40.433 --> 00:43.700
although upon closer inspection,
it did look more like
a Hershey's mint.

00:43.733 --> 00:45.833
Well, I'd sooner believe
that was you, Squirrelly Dan.

00:45.866 --> 00:47.633
So watch how
you speak on his name,
you know?

00:47.666 --> 00:50.400
Hey, buddy... He left
a Twix on the floor
just yesterday.

00:50.433 --> 00:53.033
And what made it a Twix
as opposed to a Big Turk, Dary?

00:53.066 --> 00:55.366
Well, there were
two of 'em.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.133
They're identical,
and they're side
by each.

00:57.166 --> 00:59.300
Over and out.
How would you ask somebody
if you wanted just

00:59.333 --> 01:01.266
one of their Twix's?

01:01.300 --> 01:03.866
Well, just what you said.
"Can I have one of your Twix's?"

01:03.900 --> 01:05.333
No, it'd be...
"Could I have a Twick?"

01:05.366 --> 01:08.333
In any event, it's starting
to look like Willy Wonka's
emptying his pockets

01:08.366 --> 01:09.500
around your house,
good buddy.

01:09.533 --> 01:12.000
Now, you's realize
the weight of
these allegations.

01:12.033 --> 01:13.166
These accusations.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.666
Can confirm.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.000
And you's realize
the consequences at hand
should your claim be false.

01:17.033 --> 01:19.133
Claims is's this.
Can confirm's.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.366
I'll only give you's
one more chance
to retract.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.066
No questions asked.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.666
Before this conversation
becomes a confrontation.

01:25.700 --> 01:28.400
We wouldn't be bringing it
to you if it weren't worth
being brought'en.

01:28.433 --> 01:29.700
‐But...
‐Bring it on.

01:29.733 --> 01:30.900
Oh, it has been broughten.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.066
I'm just kidding around.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.866
He's a ten‐year‐old boy, now.

01:36.900 --> 01:39.166
He's made me proud
for a goddamn decade.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.633
He's been a real good bo.

01:40.666 --> 01:42.266
He's been such a bo.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.633
But he's a senior now.

01:43.666 --> 01:46.333
He's on the home stretch,
and I'm trying to let him
enjoy it.

01:46.366 --> 01:49.033
Snoozin' on the furniture,
lots of human food.

01:49.066 --> 01:50.666
Leash is so long now,
she's limp.

01:50.700 --> 01:51.966
And he's earned it.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.900
So you're just gonna
let him drop Baby Ruth's
all over the house?

01:54.933 --> 01:55.966
As opposed to what, Katy?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.166
Just give him
a real good, stern
talking to.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.800
Oh, yeah, and how's
that gonna shake down?

01:59.833 --> 02:01.200
He's probably
half fuckin' deaf.

02:01.233 --> 02:02.900
Aren't you,
you fuckin' geezer?

02:02.933 --> 02:05.700
The same way it shook down
for the last decade before
you stopped disciplining him,

02:05.733 --> 02:06.600
just 'cause he's old.

02:06.633 --> 02:09.800
Okay, Katy.
Katy, okay, I'm going in.

02:09.833 --> 02:11.766
Wish me luck.

02:11.800 --> 02:15.633
All right, was that you
leaving Crispy Crunchers
all over the floor?

02:15.666 --> 02:18.833
'Cause that's a bad dog,
don't you do that again,
that's bad.

02:18.866 --> 02:20.000
Lickety‐split.

02:20.033 --> 02:21.200
Ah, that's a wee bit
aggressive.

02:21.233 --> 02:22.333
Oh is that what
I'm being, Dary?

02:22.366 --> 02:23.600
Well, that's your pal
you're talking to over there,

02:23.633 --> 02:26.200
fairly accusatory.
I'd say give him
benefit of the doubt.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.700
I wouldn't.
Well, you didn't even ask
him if he did it there.

02:28.733 --> 02:30.266
You just assumed,
I think you're better
than that.

02:30.300 --> 02:33.833
Okay, Dary. Dary, okay,
I'm going back in,
wish me luck.

02:34.733 --> 02:36.633
Aye.

02:36.666 --> 02:38.733
Was that you leaving
Jersey Milks on the floor?

02:38.766 --> 02:40.933
Because that's bad,
if that was you,
that was bad.

02:40.966 --> 02:43.266
Don't you do that
again ever,
'cause I'll be there.

02:44.266 --> 02:46.200
You're not taking
this seriously.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.666
Oh, is that what
I'm not doing, Katy?

02:47.700 --> 02:49.366
No, you're joking around
and he knows it.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.900
It's, "Bad boy,
this is a bad boy."

02:51.933 --> 02:55.000
Hey, he knows that
I'm joking but he doesn't
know that you're joking.

02:55.033 --> 02:57.233
Don't say "bad"
unless you mean bad.

02:57.266 --> 02:58.266
I'm sorry, Gus.

02:58.300 --> 03:01.733
That's okay, he's a good boy,
he's such a boy.

03:01.766 --> 03:04.700
Why don't you just try
using your real voice?
It may permeate better.

03:04.733 --> 03:07.166
Okay, Katy. Katy, okay,
I'm going back in.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.366
Wish me luck.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.666
Hey, bud.

03:09.700 --> 03:12.133
I noticed that you've
been leaving Caramilks
all over the floor,

03:12.166 --> 03:14.700
you know what's gonna
happen? Someone's gonna
step on one in the night

03:14.733 --> 03:17.366
and take a header,
someone's gonna pull
a full gainer down the stairs.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.166
Or at the very least,
a half gainer.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.933
So what you wanna do
is do that outside
like a good boy.

03:21.966 --> 03:23.033
Please and thanks.

03:23.833 --> 03:24.866
I thinks we're almost there.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.366
Oh, is that where
we almost are, Squirrelly Dan?

03:26.400 --> 03:29.366
Now, Professor Tricia says
that when you're bringing
a complaints to someone,

03:29.400 --> 03:31.833
they'll be more receptive
to altering their behavior

03:31.866 --> 03:33.100
if you make it
your problem.

03:33.133 --> 03:36.200
Make it personal
rather than placing
the blames on them.

03:36.233 --> 03:38.333
What are you fuckin'
getting on about
over there?

03:38.366 --> 03:40.866
May I's?
Okay, Dan. Dan, okay.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.300
Go on in, good luck.

03:43.666 --> 03:45.400
Gus, how are you now?

03:45.433 --> 03:48.100
Now, we've all noticed
the Coffee Crisps around
the house,

03:48.133 --> 03:51.833
and that's completely
natural and nothing for youse
to be embarrassed about.

03:51.866 --> 03:54.933
But I am quite worried
I am going to slip on one
and take a full gainer,

03:54.966 --> 03:57.000
or... Please look
at me when I'm talking, Gus.

03:57.033 --> 03:59.066
Now, while I know
that that is my problem,

03:59.100 --> 04:01.400
I know you don't want
this to happen any more
than I do.

04:01.433 --> 04:05.066
So I'm hoping we can
works together to find
a resolution to this problem.

04:05.100 --> 04:08.866
But besides that, we want you
to know, we think you're doing
a terrific job around here

04:08.900 --> 04:11.033
and we don't want
to bothers you anymore
than we needs to,

04:11.066 --> 04:13.966
so you have yourself
a great day.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.800
I'm not going to make you
sit through that butt‐fuckery,
Bud, away you go.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.266
You're a good boy,
away you go.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.533
Away you go.

04:20.566 --> 04:23.100
Look, I know he's just
snoozing on the furniture
all day,

04:23.133 --> 04:25.400
but you take him out
for routine number twos.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.433
Ten‐four?

04:26.466 --> 04:28.733
You try taking him out,
Katy, he don't wanna.

04:28.766 --> 04:30.466
You can say,
"Hey, Gus,
wanna rock one?"

04:30.500 --> 04:33.633
And if he could talk,
he'd say, "I've had to rock one
for a good seven, eight hours.

04:33.666 --> 04:35.133
"Don't worry about
that right now.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.833
"I'm gonna grab another
quick 20, 25 shut‐eye here,
we'll circle back

04:37.866 --> 04:39.266
"on the conversation later.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.766

itchings and scratchings
in the meantime?"

We were told that you
may be going for
the same guy.

Or, or that the same
guy may be going
for both of you.

05:28.433 --> 05:30.766
Impossible.
How do you mean?

05:30.800 --> 05:35.066
The last guy that was
into Mary‐Anne was the priest
at Catholic school in grade six.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.866
And only 'cause he thought
she was a boy.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.666
Well done, Betty‐Anne.
Catholic school, grade six.

05:39.700 --> 05:43.166
Isn't that the same year
you got the nickname
"Fisted Sister"?

Which you gave yourself?

05:44.666 --> 05:46.100

"Women."

it was, Betty‐Anne.

You did?
And?

09:13.833 --> 09:16.200
And he, um...
What?

09:16.233 --> 09:17.900
He said...
What?

09:19.133 --> 09:21.100
He said you suck
at hockey.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.900
Huh?
Yeah, he said
you should stick

09:26.933 --> 09:28.366
to Ringette.
Huh?

09:28.400 --> 09:33.333
Yeah, he said that you
should never ever let
a woman do a man's job.

09:33.366 --> 09:35.266
He did?
BOTH: Yeah.

09:35.300 --> 09:39.133
I was standing there like,
"What is this guy saying?"

09:39.166 --> 09:41.200
And then he said,
"Who let the broads out
of the kitchen?"

09:41.233 --> 09:42.833
He did not.
Yeah.

09:42.866 --> 09:45.066
And we were like,
"What?

09:45.100 --> 09:46.900
"You can't say that."
And he's like,

09:46.933 --> 09:49.633
"Yeah, I can. They should be
making me my supper."

09:49.666 --> 09:50.866
And I was,
"Whoa, dude."

09:50.900 --> 09:52.700
Did he?
Yeah.

09:52.733 --> 09:56.766
I mean, we're like,
"Dude, you're crazy."

09:56.800 --> 10:00.066
Then he said, "I mean,
how'd they find time
for hockey,

10:00.100 --> 10:02.700
"while they're cleaning
the floors and doing
my laundry."

10:02.733 --> 10:03.966
Did he?
Yeah,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.366
and that's not even...
That's not even
the craziest part.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.700

And believe us,

10:08.733 --> 10:10.733
we had had enough
at this point, but
we were like,

10:10.766 --> 10:11.833
"Are you sure
about this?"

10:11.866 --> 10:15.266
And he was like,
"Anybody can go
back‐to‐back."

10:15.300 --> 10:19.333
Yeah, and we're like,
"Dude, you better stop
talking about those girls

10:19.366 --> 10:20.500
"like that."
Mmm.

10:20.533 --> 10:23.300
"Better stop talking
about those women
like that."

10:23.333 --> 10:26.233
