WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:11.534
Direct hit.

00:11.611 --> 00:16.309
The target buoy is solid
monotanium ten meters thick,

00:16.383 --> 00:18.977
shielded by a chromoelectric
force field.

00:19.085 --> 00:19.983
lmpressive.

00:20.086 --> 00:21.417
l'm glad you agree.

00:21.488 --> 00:22.887
lt's not wise
to travel this region

00:22.956 --> 00:24.514
without adequate defenses.

00:24.591 --> 00:25.990
l've seen scuttled ships

00:26.059 --> 00:28.152
with more firepower
than Voyager.

00:28.228 --> 00:29.695
l'm sure you have.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.128
lmagine what you'll

00:31.197 --> 00:33.256
be capable of once
the isokinetic cannon

00:33.333 --> 00:35.927
is integrated
into your defensive systems.

00:36.002 --> 00:38.994
One projectile
can penetrate the shields

00:39.105 --> 00:41.539
of any heavily- armored vessel.

00:41.608 --> 00:45.009
Hostile species will
know to avoid Voyager

00:45.078 --> 00:47.046
by reputation alone.

00:47.113 --> 00:48.944
You've made your point,
Mr. Kovin.

00:49.015 --> 00:51.176
l want the cannon.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.579
And l'm prepared to give you...

01:00.160 --> 01:03.254
astrometric charts
spanning 12 sectors.

01:03.329 --> 01:06.230
You'll find them
unusually precise.

01:06.299 --> 01:10.099
Even the most sophisticated
charts become obsolete.

01:10.170 --> 01:13.469
One random anomaly and they're
no longer accurate.

01:13.540 --> 01:18.443
However, l could be persuaded
if you were to include

01:18.511 --> 01:20.877
the mapping technology
that created them.

01:20.947 --> 01:21.879
Sorry.

01:21.948 --> 01:23.438
Our astrometric sensors

01:23.516 --> 01:25.746
were designed specifically
for this ship.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.343
They'd be of no use to you.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.513
What l can offer you

01:29.589 --> 01:33.252
is a generous supply
of isolinear processing chips.

01:33.326 --> 01:35.658
We'll even show you
how to integrate them

01:35.728 --> 01:37.992
into your existing
sensor technology.

01:38.064 --> 01:40.555
How generous a supply?

01:40.633 --> 01:41.895
100 chips.

01:41.968 --> 01:42.992
150.

01:43.069 --> 01:44.036
1 15.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.036
125.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.037
Done.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.573
Escort our guest to Engineering.

01:47.640 --> 01:51.576
You'll be supervising
the installation of the cannon?

01:51.644 --> 01:54.613
Of course...
for a modest fee.

01:54.681 --> 01:57.445
Five additional chips.
No more.

01:57.517 --> 01:59.041
lt's good to see
the art of negotiation

01:59.119 --> 02:00.552
isn't lost on you, Captain.

02:04.724 --> 02:06.248
That guy is worse
than a Ferengi.

02:06.326 --> 02:09.124
Assign Seven of Nine
to work on this.

02:09.195 --> 02:11.390
She's got a knack
for adapting alien technology.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.159
Should l give her
complete access

02:13.233 --> 02:15.098
to the Engineering
control systems?

02:15.168 --> 02:17.295
l'm ready to give her
some latitude.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.361
She's been
behaving herself lately.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.182 --> 02:30.672
What are you working on?

02:30.750 --> 02:32.809
l'm trying to decode the message

02:32.886 --> 02:34.751
Starfleet Command
sent us several weeks ago.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.311
Any progress?

02:36.389 --> 02:37.822
None.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.121
l'm working on a new
decryption algorithm.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.286
l'd like you to set
it aside for a while.

02:42.362 --> 02:43.795
l have another assignment
for you.

02:43.863 --> 02:45.455
What is it?

02:45.532 --> 02:46.999
The Captain wants you
to help Kovin

02:47.066 --> 02:48.499
integrate the new weapon system.

02:48.568 --> 02:49.535
l'd rather not.

02:49.602 --> 02:50.762
l find him inefficient.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.804
Maybe so,

02:51.871 --> 02:53.998
but you seem
to work well with him.

02:54.073 --> 02:56.803
You've been asking
for more responsibilities.

02:56.876 --> 02:58.036
l thought you'd be pleased.

02:58.144 --> 02:59.941
The Captain gives me
greater liberty

03:00.013 --> 03:01.605
only when she needs
my expertise.

03:01.714 --> 03:03.341
You violated her trust

03:03.383 --> 03:06.443
and if you want it back,
you're going to have to earn it

03:06.519 --> 03:08.453
one step at a time.

03:15.495 --> 03:17.929
l will report to Engineering.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.731
You'll need to install
isolinear buffer circuits

03:24.804 --> 03:27.136
here and here.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.139
The main power relay

03:28.208 --> 03:30.176
should be protected
by a containment field.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.074
Unnecessary.
All the buffer circuits

03:32.145 --> 03:33.874
would have to fail
simultaneously

03:33.947 --> 03:35.107
for there to be any danger.

03:35.181 --> 03:37.877
We prefer to play it safe.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.784
l'll check the inventory logs
to see if we have

03:40.853 --> 03:42.013
a field generator available.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.296
What are you doing?

03:55.368 --> 03:57.962
l'm reconfiguring
the tactical control systems.

03:58.037 --> 04:00.005
The isokinetic
circuits requires

04:00.039 --> 04:01.563
a specialized protocol.

04:01.608 --> 04:02.768
Let me take care of it.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.104
That won't be necessary.

04:06.346 --> 04:09.873
No. No. The subroutines
need to be arranged

04:09.949 --> 04:11.576
in cascading sequence.

04:11.651 --> 04:12.879
Let me show you.

04:18.324 --> 04:19.848
Seven, stop.

06:15.341 --> 06:18.367
There's a hairline fracture
of the premaxilla bone.

06:18.444 --> 06:21.538
Do you see this, Captain?
She shattered it.

06:21.614 --> 06:22.774
lt's easily repaired.

06:22.849 --> 06:24.578
Do you have any idea
why Seven attacked you?

06:24.650 --> 06:25.582
lt was unprovoked.

06:25.651 --> 06:28.643
She came at me like an animal.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.621
Well, l wouldn't put it
like that.

06:31.591 --> 06:34.219
l was at another console
about ten meters away.

06:34.293 --> 06:36.693
l heard Kovin raise his voice
and when l looked around

06:36.763 --> 06:37.923
l saw that he was
holding her arm.

06:38.030 --> 06:40.055
l barely touched her!

06:40.133 --> 06:42.897
A gentle gesture
to move her out of my way,

06:42.969 --> 06:43.901
so l could get to the console.

06:43.970 --> 06:46.598
Then she turned on me,
attacked me.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.139
What did you say to her?

06:48.207 --> 06:49.299
l told her how to reconfigure

06:49.375 --> 06:51.935
the tactical control systems
properly.

06:52.044 --> 06:52.976
ls that all?

06:53.045 --> 06:54.410
That's all.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.778
And that's when she
knocked him down.

06:56.849 --> 06:59.340
Ashmore and l
had to hold her back.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.613
She would have killed me.

07:00.686 --> 07:01.846
That woman is dangerous.

07:01.954 --> 07:03.148
lt's a miracle you survived.

07:03.222 --> 07:05.053
Now, hold still or this
won't heal properly.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.423
Why are you
questioning me on this?

07:07.493 --> 07:09.154
You should be disciplining
your crew member.

07:09.228 --> 07:10.957
Believe me, l'll deal with it.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.861
Please accept
my sincere apology.

07:12.932 --> 07:13.956
Now, if you'll excuse me.

07:16.869 --> 07:18.097
Good as new.

07:23.709 --> 07:24.767
Come in.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.855
Here we are again.

07:36.923 --> 07:39.391
Oh, l'm tired of having
this conversation.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.653
You know what l'm going to say.

07:40.726 --> 07:42.057
l know how you're
going to respond,

07:42.128 --> 07:44.119
so it seems pointless
to say anything.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.495
Shall l consider
my privileges restricted

07:46.566 --> 07:48.557
and confine myself
to the cargo bay?

07:48.634 --> 07:49.931
l think we've established

07:50.002 --> 07:51.970
that traditional
disciplinary actions

07:52.038 --> 07:53.938
don't work with you.

07:54.006 --> 07:57.464
The question is:
What will?

07:57.543 --> 07:59.943
Are you asking for my opinion?

08:00.012 --> 08:01.411
l suppose l am...

08:01.447 --> 08:04.575
because frankly,
l'm running out of options.

08:04.617 --> 08:06.676
Throwing you in the brig
isn't going to solve anything.

08:06.752 --> 08:08.310
Neither is slapping you
on the wrist.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.378
And it's not as though
l don't understand

08:10.456 --> 08:11.753
your feelings about Kovin.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.019
There have been a few times
when l'd have liked

08:14.093 --> 08:15.185
to pop him in the nose myself,

08:15.261 --> 08:16.819
but you have to start
learning the difference

08:16.896 --> 08:20.559
between having an impulse
and acting on it.

08:20.633 --> 08:23.329
Does that make any sense to you?

08:24.637 --> 08:26.127
l believe so.

08:26.205 --> 08:27.968
l will give it more thought.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.374
Well, that's a start.

08:33.746 --> 08:36.578
l hear there was some excitement
this morning.

08:36.649 --> 08:39.914
When l started helping you
improve your social skills,

08:40.019 --> 08:43.147
l'm fairly certain l didn't
include a boxing lesson.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.156
You weren't hurt, were you?

08:45.224 --> 08:46.555
No.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.621
Still a bit tense?

08:50.830 --> 08:52.661
Perhaps.

08:52.732 --> 08:55.132
l understand
the burden you carry--

08:55.201 --> 08:57.294
constantly being obligated
to deal with those

08:57.370 --> 08:59.167
who fall short of excellence.

08:59.238 --> 09:01.570
l often find my own patience

09:01.641 --> 09:04.439
being tested by someone
like Mr. Kovin.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.774
Of course, l generally respond
with a devastating quip

09:06.846 --> 09:08.211
rather than a left hook.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.846
We must both accept
the fact that very few

09:12.952 --> 09:16.115
life- forms will ever meet
our high standards.

09:16.188 --> 09:19.521
So, when you get irritated
just try to be tolerant,

09:19.592 --> 09:22.789
and remember-- they can't
help being what they are.

09:22.862 --> 09:26.628
Hmm...l'm reading some
increased engramatic activity

09:26.699 --> 09:29.566
and your adrenaline levels
are slightly elevated.

09:29.635 --> 09:31.068
What does that indicate?

09:31.137 --> 09:34.072
lt's consistent with a state
of heightened tension.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.471
Lie down
and l'll run some scans.

09:37.176 --> 09:41.044
ln a typical human, l would
consider this a mood swing,

09:41.113 --> 09:43.547
but with your unique physiology,
l'd like to rule out

09:43.616 --> 09:45.607
the possibility
of a chemical imbalance.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.919
Have you been experiencing

09:53.993 --> 09:56.484
any other symptoms--
headaches, disorientation?

09:56.562 --> 09:58.359
No.

10:03.235 --> 10:06.329
Physiological scans seem normal.

10:06.405 --> 10:08.839
l'm going to check
your Borg implants now.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.538
Seven...what's wrong?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.477
Let me out.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.105
l will. Stay calm.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.815
No more procedures.

10:23.889 --> 10:25.413
- All right.
- Stay away!

10:25.491 --> 10:27.356
You mustn't do this.

10:27.426 --> 10:28.552
Do what?

10:28.628 --> 10:30.562
Seven, what are you
so afraid of?

10:32.698 --> 10:33.926
l don't know.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.867
She experienced an episode
of acute anxiety

10:42.942 --> 10:45.342
with all the trimmings--
intense apprehension,

10:45.411 --> 10:47.174
shortness of breath, dizziness.

10:47.246 --> 10:49.043
l finally managed to sedate her.

10:49.115 --> 10:52.050
Could this have been caused
by her cortical implants?

10:52.118 --> 10:53.210
l don't think so.

10:53.285 --> 10:55.719
l think the problem has to
do with memory suppression.

10:55.788 --> 10:58.188
l've detected
a high concentration

10:58.257 --> 11:00.817
of biogenic amines
in Seven's hippocampus--

11:00.893 --> 11:02.656
a substance l haven't
noticed before.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.889
lt's blocking several portions
of her memory center.

11:04.964 --> 11:06.056
Do you know where it came from?

11:06.132 --> 11:08.794
No, but it seems
to be dissipating.

11:08.868 --> 11:11.735
Seven's unusual behavior
may be the result

11:11.804 --> 11:13.863
of the blocked memories
beginning to surface--

11:13.939 --> 11:16.203
memories which she can't
identify yet.

11:16.275 --> 11:17.299
Can you treat her?

11:17.376 --> 11:18.343
Treatment would involve

11:18.411 --> 11:19.639
integrating
the repressed memories

11:19.712 --> 11:21.145
into Seven's consciousness.

11:21.213 --> 11:23.807
l may be able to use
a standard therapeutic

11:23.883 --> 11:25.282
regression technique.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.114
l wasn't aware
that you were programmed

11:27.186 --> 11:28.813
with psychotherapeutic
capabilities.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.550
l wasn't, but in the absence
of a Ship's Counselor,

11:31.624 --> 11:33.990
l've been developing
a psychiatric subroutine

11:34.060 --> 11:34.992
to add to my program.

11:35.094 --> 11:38.621
l'll be even more valuable
to you than l am now.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.063
Keep me informed, Doctor.

11:43.069 --> 11:44.934
Hmm.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.264
A Jungian therapist

11:46.338 --> 11:48.704
would attempt to retrieve
unconscious memories

11:48.774 --> 11:52.301
by exploring synchronicities
in recent events.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.437
On the other hand,
Amanin of Betazed

11:54.513 --> 11:58.040
would argue that a combination
of sensory isolation

11:58.117 --> 12:01.280
and focused breathing techniques
would be more effective.

12:01.353 --> 12:03.913
l've integrated
the finer points of both

12:04.023 --> 12:07.151
to create my own approach
to memory reconstruction.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.626
What does this approach involve?

12:09.695 --> 12:10.855
First, putting you at ease

12:10.930 --> 12:13.899
by performing the treatment
here in your own environment.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.058
Once the cortical probes

12:15.134 --> 12:17.102
have reinforced
the neural pathways,

12:17.169 --> 12:19.433
l'll use a directed
imagery technique

12:19.505 --> 12:21.234
to guide you
through the regression.

12:23.209 --> 12:24.676
You may proceed.

12:26.879 --> 12:28.972
Please close your eyes.

12:29.048 --> 12:31.175
Clear your mind.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.878
Try not to think or to analyze.

12:35.121 --> 12:36.952
My mind is now clear.

12:37.022 --> 12:40.981
Seven, this isn't
an exercise in efficiency.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.652
Close your eyes.

12:43.696 --> 12:46.187
Breathe deeply.

12:46.265 --> 12:49.200
Now concentrate
on the sound of my voice.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.099
Let go of the present.

12:51.170 --> 12:54.367
Leave the cargo bay behind.

12:54.440 --> 12:58.240
Allow yourself...
to drift.

13:01.747 --> 13:05.046
Describe the first image
that enters your mind.

13:07.853 --> 13:09.844
A medical tricorder.

13:09.922 --> 13:12.652
Duratanium casing.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.125
7. 6 centimeters
by 9. 8 centimeters

13:15.294 --> 13:17.888
by 3. 2 centimeters.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.590
Alpha- numeric display...

13:19.665 --> 13:21.496
That's enough.

13:21.567 --> 13:22.659
So...

13:24.904 --> 13:26.769
you're in Sick Bay.

13:26.839 --> 13:30.775
How does the tricorder
make you feel?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.473
lt disturbs me.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.878
Why does it disturb you?

13:35.948 --> 13:37.939
l'm afraid it will hurt me.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.382
ls there anything else there

13:39.451 --> 13:41.919
that causes you
to anticipate pain?

13:43.622 --> 13:45.214
The diagnostic bed.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.259
lt's closing around me.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.817
You feel restrained, confined.

13:49.895 --> 13:51.385
Yes. l am uneasy.

13:51.463 --> 13:52.430
About what?

13:56.769 --> 13:57.758
lt's Kovin.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.566
What is he doing?

13:59.638 --> 14:02.539
He's restraining me.

14:02.641 --> 14:05.576
l want to get away from him,
but l can't.

14:10.983 --> 14:13.474
Kovin's using some kind
of instrument on me.

14:18.591 --> 14:19.751
Seven?

14:20.793 --> 14:23.557
l didn't recall this before.

14:23.629 --> 14:25.221
Recall what?

14:25.297 --> 14:27.629
Kovin. He...

14:29.001 --> 14:31.663
he performed
a surgical procedure on me.

14:31.737 --> 14:34.706
He...extracted Borg technology

14:34.773 --> 14:36.070
from my body.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.442
He violated me.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.643
We're making progress.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.777
Now, tell me.

14:47.853 --> 14:49.844
This surgical procedure...

14:49.922 --> 14:51.913
when did it happen?

14:51.991 --> 14:52.923
l don't know.

14:52.992 --> 14:54.584
The details are vague.

14:54.660 --> 14:55.991
There are only images.

14:56.095 --> 14:57.790
And you're sure it was Kovin?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.525
Did you see Kovin?

15:00.599 --> 15:02.328
Yes.

15:02.401 --> 15:04.369
You said
he was restraining you,

15:04.436 --> 15:05.664
using an instrument

15:05.738 --> 15:07.501
- of some sort.
- He was.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.336
Were you on Voyager
when this happened?

15:11.043 --> 15:12.908
No.

15:12.978 --> 15:14.411
lt must have been when we were

15:14.480 --> 15:16.243
testing the weapons
on the surface.

15:16.315 --> 15:18.613
Then concentrate
on that away mission.

15:18.684 --> 15:22.120
Focus on the first image
that enters your mind.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.055
Describe it for me.

15:28.127 --> 15:29.788
A large granitic stone...

15:29.862 --> 15:32.524
approximately
one- half meter high.

15:32.598 --> 15:36.728
Now, allow that memory
to develop beyond the image.

15:36.802 --> 15:38.827
lntegrate it
into your consciousness.

15:38.904 --> 15:41.065
Let the memory take shape.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.371
l'm at the weapons range.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.846
Kovin had taken us there

15:49.915 --> 15:52.247
to evaluate various
handheld firearms

15:52.318 --> 15:54.081
he wished to offer in trade.

16:00.092 --> 16:03.220
He attempted to impress us
with a demonstration

16:03.295 --> 16:05.729
of the weapons'
destructive capabilities.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.029
My role was to provide
a more objective analysis.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.864
Terawatt powered
particle beam rifle.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.564
Four microsecond recharge cycle.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.436
Ten kilometer range.

16:15.507 --> 16:18.499
Definitely
not standard Starfleet issue.

16:18.577 --> 16:20.101
What do you think?

16:20.179 --> 16:23.910
72 percent fragmentation,
28 percent vaporization.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.679
Crude but efficient.

16:26.752 --> 16:29.448
lt's not as accurate
as our compression rifles,

16:29.521 --> 16:31.512
but it's a lot easier to handle.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.148
l wouldn't mind
carrying one of these

16:33.225 --> 16:35.125
the next time we run
into the Hirogen.

16:35.194 --> 16:37.754
The targeting mechanism
could be augmented

16:37.830 --> 16:40.390
with a thermal guidance sensor.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.866
That would increase
accuracy by 24 percent.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.527
l can do that now.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.063
Care to join me?

16:48.140 --> 16:49.368
You can make sure
that the adjustments

16:49.441 --> 16:51.068
are performed
to your specifications.

16:51.143 --> 16:52.872
lf you don't mind,

16:52.945 --> 16:54.674
l'd like to test
some of the other firearms.

16:54.747 --> 16:55.679
Go right ahead.

16:57.383 --> 16:58.941
This way.

17:02.421 --> 17:04.787
Kovin took me
to a small laboratory.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.551
Describe it.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.593
lt was poorly illuminated.

17:08.660 --> 17:12.117
l saw various instruments--
technology unfamiliar to me.

17:12.196 --> 17:15.428
l assumed this was where he
developed new weapon designs.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.267
This weapon is thoron- based.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.136
Most of these handheld
disruptors are.

17:22.207 --> 17:25.005
Thoron can be unstable
in weapons.

17:25.077 --> 17:27.102
Not if you polarize
the emitter matrix.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.670
That compensates
for any instabilities.

17:29.748 --> 17:32.012
Watch.

17:37.856 --> 17:39.881
What are you doing?

17:39.958 --> 17:41.892
He turned the weapon on me.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.655
He fired?

17:43.729 --> 17:45.560
Yes, l remember it now.

17:45.631 --> 17:47.155
What happened next?

17:49.201 --> 17:50.896
l'm not sure.

17:50.969 --> 17:52.459
Concentrate.

17:52.538 --> 17:55.029
See the laboratory in your mind.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.176
There was a light in my eyes.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.638
Was Kovin still
in the room with you?

18:04.716 --> 18:05.842
Yes.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.647
Restrain her. Quickly.

18:07.719 --> 18:10.279
And another Entharan
was assisting him.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.052
This is Borg technology.

18:13.125 --> 18:16.185
That's what l've been
telling you.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.990
Let me go.

18:18.063 --> 18:20.327
They bound me
to an examination table.

18:20.399 --> 18:21.764
What did they do to you?

18:21.834 --> 18:23.233
Did they scan you?

18:26.305 --> 18:29.763
The bio- ablation pump
is engaged and pressurized.

18:43.222 --> 18:45.656
The growth medium
is activating the implants.

18:45.724 --> 18:47.692
The nanoprobes are multiplying.

18:52.397 --> 18:54.388
They put a device near my head.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.196
They removed my ocular implant.

18:59.371 --> 19:01.100
And...

19:01.206 --> 19:04.107
some of the implants in my arm
were activated.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.043
Which ones?

19:06.111 --> 19:07.578
Can you be more specific?

19:07.646 --> 19:11.707
Use the maximum setting
of the metagenic pulse

19:11.783 --> 19:13.444
to stimulate the implants.

19:14.553 --> 19:17.488
The assimilation
tubules are ready.

19:17.556 --> 19:20.525
Prepare to harvest
the nanoprobes.

19:24.763 --> 19:26.856
They extracted nanoprobes

19:26.965 --> 19:28.990
through
my assimilation tubules.

19:29.067 --> 19:33.265
l was powerless...
unable to stop them.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.169
You couldn't be expected to.

19:35.240 --> 19:39.233
You were restrained.
Then what happened?

19:39.311 --> 19:41.745
They took the nanoprobes
to another subject--

19:41.813 --> 19:45.044
also restrained-- and they...

19:45.117 --> 19:46.516
they assimilated him.

19:52.524 --> 19:53.855
Well done.

19:58.864 --> 20:02.265
The next thing l remember,
l was back in Kovin's lab.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.564
He claimed the particle beam
rifle overloaded--

20:04.636 --> 20:07.628
that it burned my hand--
but it was a lie.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.367
They had attacked me.

20:09.441 --> 20:12.877
l'm sorry.
l should have been more careful.

20:14.513 --> 20:15.980
Do you have
a dermal regenerator?

20:16.048 --> 20:17.015
Of course.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.724
l'll inform the Captain.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.364
There's no doubt

20:39.438 --> 20:41.998
that Seven was the victim
of a brutal assault.

20:42.140 --> 20:43.038
How is she?

20:43.141 --> 20:45.006
As well as can be expected.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.942
She's regenerating
in her alcove.

20:47.012 --> 20:50.345
l predict her emotional recovery
will take some time.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.441
l certainly hope you intend
to hold Kovin responsible

20:53.518 --> 20:54.780
for what he's done.

20:54.853 --> 20:57.048
First, l want to know how much
of her story we can corroborate.

20:57.122 --> 20:58.487
Tom, you were with her
on the planet.

20:58.557 --> 21:00.548
How long was she alone
with Kovin?

21:00.626 --> 21:02.287
At least two hours.

21:02.361 --> 21:03.293
And when she came back,

21:03.362 --> 21:04.920
did she say anything
about what happened?

21:04.997 --> 21:07.227
Only that they'd finished
their work on the rifle.

21:07.299 --> 21:08.425
She seemed fine.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.329
Clearly, Mr. Kovin used
some artificial means

21:10.402 --> 21:12.393
to suppress her memory
of the event.

21:12.471 --> 21:14.735
That would explain
the unusual engramatic activity

21:14.806 --> 21:16.933
l found
in her neurological scans.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.476
Did you find
any other physical evidence

21:18.543 --> 21:20.841
of the medical procedures
she described?

21:20.912 --> 21:22.675
No.

21:22.748 --> 21:26.343
l suspect Mr. Kovin
used Seven's own nanoprobes

21:26.418 --> 21:28.443
to repair any cellular damage.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.683
She distinctly remembers
Kovin extracting them.

21:31.757 --> 21:35.318
You seen to be accepting Seven's
recovered memories as fact.

21:35.394 --> 21:36.793
Are you suggesting otherwise?

21:36.862 --> 21:38.796
Historically,
recovered memories

21:38.864 --> 21:40.126
have often proven unreliable.

21:40.198 --> 21:42.689
Yes, in cases where
a traumatic experience

21:42.768 --> 21:44.565
has been repressed for years.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.002
But we're dealing with
a very recent memory here

21:47.072 --> 21:49.336
that was blocked
by artificial means.

21:49.408 --> 21:50.773
When l removed that mechanism,

21:50.842 --> 21:52.776
Seven remembered everything
that happened.

21:52.844 --> 21:55.142
Human memory is rarely perfect.

21:55.213 --> 21:56.737
What are you saying, Tuvok?

21:56.815 --> 21:58.749
That Seven is making this up?

21:58.817 --> 22:01.012
No, but we must remember

22:01.119 --> 22:03.849
that she's experienced
hallucinatory images before.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.413
That was in direct response

22:05.490 --> 22:07.924
to a signal from the ship
where she was assimilated.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.052
She's not having
hallucinations now.

22:10.128 --> 22:11.720
She's remembering
what happened to her.

22:11.797 --> 22:12.923
l've confirmed this

22:13.031 --> 22:14.931
by analyzing the specific
engramatic activity

22:15.000 --> 22:15.932
in her hippocampus.

22:16.034 --> 22:17.934
We're not talking
about conjecture.

22:18.036 --> 22:19.128
We're talking about science.

22:19.204 --> 22:20.694
Let's not get bogged down.

22:22.741 --> 22:24.675
Seven has made
serious accusations

22:24.743 --> 22:26.176
and l won't dismiss them.

22:26.244 --> 22:28.610
lf Kovin assaulted her

22:28.680 --> 22:31.376
and took a sample
of her Borg technology,

22:31.450 --> 22:32.974
we can't stand by
and do nothing.

22:33.051 --> 22:35.212
ln the wrong hands,
a single nanoprobe

22:35.287 --> 22:36.845
could lead to disaster.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.981
Doctor, l want you
to keep searching

22:39.057 --> 22:42.185
for any physical evidence
to back up Seven's claim.

22:42.260 --> 22:43.887
l will talk to Kovin.

22:43.962 --> 22:45.520
Dismissed.

22:50.602 --> 22:52.797
This is offensive and absurd!

22:52.871 --> 22:54.338
She's obviously lying.

22:54.406 --> 22:56.499
Why would she do that?

22:56.575 --> 22:58.270
Maybe you can answer that.

22:58.343 --> 22:59.742
She's your crew member.

22:59.811 --> 23:00.778
First, she attacks me,

23:00.879 --> 23:03.040
then, she invents
these ridiculous stories

23:03.081 --> 23:04.810
and you try
to place the blame on me.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.215
ls this some kind
of negotiating tactic?

23:07.285 --> 23:08.411
l have no hidden agenda.

23:08.487 --> 23:10.546
l'm simply trying
to clarify what happened.

23:10.622 --> 23:11.589
l told you already.

23:11.656 --> 23:12.850
We went to my laboratory

23:12.924 --> 23:15.688
to adjust the guidance system
on the particle beam rifle.

23:15.761 --> 23:17.695
And that took two hours?

23:17.763 --> 23:20.425
She insisted
on absolute precision.

23:21.466 --> 23:23.627
We've confirmed
that Seven was exposed

23:23.702 --> 23:25.499
to an intense thoron discharge.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.562
She was-- after the rifle's
power cell overloaded.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.870
We reported the accident
immediately.

23:30.942 --> 23:34.309
She now remembers that you fired
the weapon at her deliberately.

23:34.379 --> 23:35.641
That's preposterous.

23:35.714 --> 23:36.908
The Doctor tells me

23:36.982 --> 23:39.610
the blast could have been enough
to render her unconscious.

23:39.684 --> 23:40.981
But it didn't.

23:41.052 --> 23:43.418
We were both startled
for a moment

23:43.488 --> 23:45.217
and after l apologized
for the accident,

23:45.290 --> 23:47.281
she asked if l had
a dermal regenerator,

23:47.359 --> 23:49.691
which l did,
and l used it on her arm--

23:49.761 --> 23:51.786
the one
with the mechanical implants.

23:51.863 --> 23:53.728
Which you recognized as Borg.

23:53.799 --> 23:55.596
l was aware she'd been a Borg.

23:55.667 --> 23:56.759
She told me herself.

23:56.835 --> 24:00.362
Did you ever express curiosity
in that technology

24:00.439 --> 24:01.872
or try to examine it

24:01.973 --> 24:03.201
more closely?

24:03.275 --> 24:04.333
No.

24:04.409 --> 24:07.003
You never considered
the potential value

24:07.078 --> 24:08.739
it might have as a weapon?

24:10.248 --> 24:12.443
ls that
what you think l've done?

24:12.517 --> 24:13.916
You may not realize

24:14.019 --> 24:16.647
how dangerous
Borg technology can be.

24:16.721 --> 24:18.484
lf you've taken
even a single nanoprobe,

24:18.557 --> 24:20.491
l need to know about it
right now.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.151
l haven't taken anything.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.457
l'd like to examine
your laboratory

24:26.531 --> 24:27.930
to be absolutely sure.

24:27.999 --> 24:29.296
No.

24:29.367 --> 24:31.426
This has already gone too far.

24:32.838 --> 24:35.068
Then l'll have to contact
the authorities.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.267
Maybe they'll be more helpful.

24:37.342 --> 24:39.401
Are you willing to risk
our trade agreement

24:39.478 --> 24:43.141
all on the basis
of one crew member's delusions?

24:43.215 --> 24:44.512
Yes.

24:44.583 --> 24:46.073
Now...

24:46.151 --> 24:49.120
are you going to cooperate
with our investigation?

24:50.956 --> 24:53.186
l don't seem
to have much choice.

25:01.967 --> 25:05.528
You stated that the rifle's
power cell overloaded

25:05.604 --> 25:07.572
as a result of a faulty
oscillator adjustment.

25:07.639 --> 25:09.766
That's right.

25:11.676 --> 25:15.806
Can you describe in more detail
how that occurred?

25:16.915 --> 25:19.884
l was showing her how to
polarize the emitter matrix.

25:19.951 --> 25:22.852
l must have tuned the induction
frequency too high.

25:22.921 --> 25:25.151
Were you unfamiliar
with that procedure?

25:25.223 --> 25:26.247
No.

25:26.324 --> 25:27.621
l have done it 100 times.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.057
lt was a careless mistake.

25:29.127 --> 25:31.095
How many times do l need
to apologize?

25:31.162 --> 25:33.460
l am not seeking
a statement of remorse.

25:33.532 --> 25:34.863
Then what do you want?

25:34.933 --> 25:36.833
Are you trying to catch me
in a lie?

25:36.902 --> 25:38.802
Trick me into confessing?

25:38.870 --> 25:41.668
You can't, because there's
nothing for me to confess!

25:41.740 --> 25:43.833
l haven't done anything wrong!

25:45.110 --> 25:47.601
One of our crew members
claims that you have.

25:50.615 --> 25:52.981
Your crew member,
Seven of Nine...

25:53.051 --> 25:55.349
she's very fortunate.

25:55.420 --> 25:56.978
How so?

25:57.088 --> 26:00.615
She has an entire crew
leaping to her defense.

26:00.692 --> 26:01.989
l have no one.

26:02.060 --> 26:05.427
The Entharan representative
will be here shortly.

26:05.497 --> 26:06.862
You mean the magistrate?

26:06.932 --> 26:09.196
He won't help me.

26:09.267 --> 26:12.168
He's more interested in
protecting diplomatic relations

26:12.237 --> 26:13.761
with people like you.

26:13.838 --> 26:16.671
Surely, he'll want to know
the truth.

26:16.741 --> 26:19.505
That's all we're seeking.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.636
You don't understand.

26:20.712 --> 26:24.011
On my world, we depend on trade
with alien species.

26:24.082 --> 26:27.882
There are strict protocols
about those relationships.

26:27.953 --> 26:31.855
Even being accused of violating
them is a serious offense.

26:31.923 --> 26:35.381
You will have the opportunity
to refute any charges.

26:35.460 --> 26:36.654
lt won't matter.

26:36.728 --> 26:39.196
Once they're made,
the damage is done.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.494
l won't be trusted any longer.

26:41.566 --> 26:43.033
l'll be ruined.

26:43.101 --> 26:45.501
Please...

26:45.570 --> 26:48.698
l never hurt your crew member.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.707
Don't do this.

26:52.777 --> 26:54.972
l'm afraid l have no choice.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.310
But l assure you

26:57.382 --> 26:59.077
our investigation
will be conducted

26:59.150 --> 27:01.345
in a fair and impartial manner.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.445
You strike me as a man
of your word.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.594
lf you tell me
l won't be prejudged,

27:09.661 --> 27:12.323
then l believe you.

27:19.904 --> 27:21.531
How are you feeling?

27:21.606 --> 27:23.233
l am undamaged.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.071
But how do you feel?

27:25.143 --> 27:29.637
Seven, your physical scars
have healed,

27:29.714 --> 27:32.410
but the psychological effects
are still there.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.076
You'll have to deal with them.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.585
For what purpose?

27:35.654 --> 27:37.212
ln order to heal.

27:37.288 --> 27:39.756
Kovin attacked you...

27:39.824 --> 27:42.292
violated your rights
as an individual.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.328
lt's important
that you recognize that

27:44.396 --> 27:46.921
so you can understand
any hostility or resentment

27:46.998 --> 27:48.363
you might be feeling.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.458
Resentment is a human trait.

27:50.535 --> 27:52.765
lt has no structure,
no function.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.395
l want no part of it.

27:54.472 --> 27:55.803
You're going to have
to begin accepting

27:55.874 --> 27:57.933
the fact that your
human feelings exist

27:58.009 --> 28:00.239
and that suppressing them
can damage you.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.141
lf l am not aware
of these feelings,

28:04.215 --> 28:05.739
how can l express them?

28:05.817 --> 28:07.307
Let me ask you this.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.185
What would have happened

28:11.256 --> 28:14.316
if Kovin had tried
to take Borg technology

28:14.392 --> 28:16.257
directly from the collective?

28:16.327 --> 28:17.851
He would have been assimilated.

28:17.962 --> 28:20.157
Precisely.
Which is why he chose you.

28:20.231 --> 28:23.098
He could get what he wanted
without running any risks.

28:25.403 --> 28:28.304
lt was my individuality
which made me vulnerable.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.499
Exactly.

28:31.276 --> 28:33.073
He violated that individuality.

28:33.144 --> 28:35.704
What he did is an affront
to everything you are--

28:35.780 --> 28:36.906
Borg and human.

28:37.015 --> 28:39.279
lt was the act of a coward.

28:39.350 --> 28:40.647
Yes!

28:40.719 --> 28:42.914
Someone who was
willing to use you

28:42.987 --> 28:44.113
in the cruelest way

28:44.189 --> 28:46.657
so that he could
create new weapons

28:46.725 --> 28:48.192
and sell them.

28:48.259 --> 28:52.855
l believe l am beginning
to experience anger.

28:52.931 --> 28:54.455
Anger toward Kovin.

28:54.532 --> 28:58.696
Good. That's a perfectly
healthy, normal response.

28:58.770 --> 29:00.431
And when Kovin
gets what he deserves,

29:00.538 --> 29:03.006
you're going to feel
much better.

29:06.144 --> 29:07.975
Right this way, Magistrate.

29:08.046 --> 29:09.570
My laboratory.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.650
There are no examination tables.

29:17.722 --> 29:19.383
l told you.
Just workbenches.

29:19.457 --> 29:21.220
ls this the entire facility?

29:21.292 --> 29:22.759
Yes.

29:22.827 --> 29:24.021
We should scan for signs

29:24.095 --> 29:26.427
that the room
may have been altered recently.

29:31.102 --> 29:32.763
During her regression,

29:32.837 --> 29:35.237
Seven described instruments
similar to these.

29:35.306 --> 29:36.398
Of course she did.

29:36.474 --> 29:37.498
She was here.

29:37.575 --> 29:39.133
She said a device

29:39.210 --> 29:42.646
like this was used
to remove her optic implant.

29:42.714 --> 29:44.181
That's a micro- caliper.

29:44.249 --> 29:46.444
l used it to remove the casings

29:46.518 --> 29:49.180
over the guidance system
on the particle beam rifle.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.351
And isn't this
an electrodynamic probe?

29:55.426 --> 29:57.018
Yes.

29:57.095 --> 29:59.529
Hmm.

29:59.597 --> 30:02.088
lt's equipped
with a monofilament stimulator.

30:02.167 --> 30:04.431
Could it be used to manipulate
the neurotransmitter levels

30:04.502 --> 30:05.560
in a human brain?

30:05.637 --> 30:06.899
Not as it is.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.598
But with the proper
modifications?

30:08.673 --> 30:09.662
With the proper modifications,

30:09.741 --> 30:11.265
l could reconfigure
your combadge

30:11.342 --> 30:12.934
to manipulate neurotransmitters.

30:13.077 --> 30:14.044
What's your point?

30:14.112 --> 30:15.579
l believe you've just made it.

30:21.986 --> 30:24.887
There's cellular residue
on many of these instruments.

30:24.956 --> 30:27.857
lt matches Seven's genome.

30:30.395 --> 30:31.726
With your permission, sir,

30:31.796 --> 30:33.696
l'd like to take these tools
back to Voyager

30:33.765 --> 30:35.824
where l can run
more conclusive scans.

30:35.900 --> 30:37.868
Take whatever you need.

30:37.936 --> 30:39.665
Doctor, there are a number

30:39.737 --> 30:42.399
of Borg nanoprobes
on the surface of this table.

30:42.473 --> 30:44.941
l'll just collect a sample.

30:52.183 --> 30:53.810
Hmm...

30:53.885 --> 30:57.048
That's where her arm was hit
when the rifle overloaded.

30:57.155 --> 30:58.713
The dispersal pattern
is consistent

30:58.790 --> 31:00.155
with a dermal rupture.

31:00.258 --> 31:02.818
These nanoprobes were
recently regenerated.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.329
lf this were nothing more
than cellular residue

31:05.396 --> 31:08.695
from Seven's injury,
the nanoprobes would be dormant.

31:08.766 --> 31:11.997
But these have been activated
in a very specific pattern.

31:13.037 --> 31:14.095
l have seen enough.

31:14.172 --> 31:17.573
Kovin, there is
sufficient evidence here

31:17.642 --> 31:20.634
to detain you pending
official proceedings.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.270
No.

31:22.347 --> 31:25.043
Please...no.

31:27.352 --> 31:28.319
Stay where you are.

31:28.386 --> 31:29.910
Kovin, don't...

31:29.988 --> 31:31.387
l trusted you.

31:31.456 --> 31:33.822
You said it would be
an impartial investigation,

31:33.892 --> 31:37.259
but you're all determined
to find what you want to find.

31:37.328 --> 31:39.228
Well, l'm not going
to let this happen.

31:44.836 --> 31:46.098
Tuvok to Voyager.

31:46.170 --> 31:47.159
Janeway here.

31:47.238 --> 31:49.604
Mr. Kovin has transported
out of the laboratory.

31:49.674 --> 31:51.266
Can you track
his present position?

31:51.342 --> 31:52.673
Stand by.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.474
l'm picking up
a transporter signature

31:55.546 --> 31:57.411
300 kilometers
above the surface.

31:57.482 --> 31:58.676
Captain, there's

31:58.750 --> 32:00.911
a ship powering its engines
at those coordinates.

32:01.019 --> 32:02.953
Magistrate, do you want us
to follow him?

32:02.987 --> 32:05.251
Yes...but l'd like
to join you.

32:05.323 --> 32:06.255
Very well.

32:06.324 --> 32:08.656
We'll beam you to Voyager.
Stand by.

32:13.231 --> 32:17.099
Kovin's ship is on a heading
of 18 mark 25.

32:17.168 --> 32:18.726
Set an intercept course.

32:18.803 --> 32:20.532
Get ready to lock on
a tractor beam.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.573
He's only at half impulse.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.335
His ship may not have
warp engines.

32:24.409 --> 32:27.242
We're at 9, 000 kilometers
and closing.

32:27.312 --> 32:29.041
l'm engaging the tractor beam.

32:34.986 --> 32:36.044
l can't find him.

32:37.088 --> 32:39.716
All of my sensor readings
have disappeared.

32:39.791 --> 32:40.917
He generated a photonic pulse.

32:40.992 --> 32:41.959
lt took them off- line.

32:42.026 --> 32:44.494
We'll have to reinitialize
the entire sensor array.

32:44.562 --> 32:45.529
Do it.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.531
Our investigation has suddenly
turned into a manhunt.

32:52.704 --> 32:53.568
The fact that he's running

32:53.638 --> 32:55.003
shows that he's got
something to hide.

32:55.106 --> 32:58.166
Until we find out what that is,
we can't risk letting him go.

33:05.416 --> 33:08.681
Captain's Log, Stardate 51679. 4.

33:08.753 --> 33:10.778
We've detected the warp
signature from Kovin's ship

33:10.855 --> 33:11.844
and we're now in pursuit.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.515
ln the meantime,

33:13.591 --> 33:16.856
Tuvok and l have been examining
the tools from Kovin's lab.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.919
This isn't getting us anywhere.

33:19.030 --> 33:22.363
Seven's cellular residue
is on every one of these,

33:22.433 --> 33:24.799
but that would be true
if she simply handled them.

33:24.869 --> 33:27.861
My examination of the rifle
is equally inconclusive.

33:27.939 --> 33:30.430
lt may have overloaded
accidentally...

33:30.508 --> 33:31.600
or not.

33:32.744 --> 33:35.542
l'm getting a bad feeling
about this, Tuvok.

33:35.613 --> 33:39.208
We aren't finding anything
that implicates Kovin.

33:39.283 --> 33:43.219
l told him our investigation
would be impartial.

33:43.287 --> 33:44.379
l believe it has been.

33:44.455 --> 33:45.717
lt has...

33:45.790 --> 33:48.554
but l'll admit l had some
preconceptions about him.

33:48.626 --> 33:52.118
They may have influenced
my judgment.

33:52.196 --> 33:54.164
The strongest evidence so far

33:54.232 --> 33:56.427
is the nanoprobes
the Doctor found.

33:56.501 --> 33:57.991
The fact that they
were regenerated

33:58.069 --> 34:00.537
suggests that Kovin was
experimenting with them.

34:00.638 --> 34:03.607
We don't know a great deal
about the interaction

34:03.641 --> 34:06.041
between nanoprobes
and Borg physiology.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.270
lt might be worthwhile

34:07.345 --> 34:09.813
to simulate the effect
of the rifle blast

34:09.880 --> 34:10.870
on Seven's arm

34:10.947 --> 34:12.882
and see what happens
to the nanoprobes.

34:12.949 --> 34:16.043
Good. Maybe that'll
give us some answers.

34:18.956 --> 34:21.049
ls this really necessary,
Captain?

34:21.125 --> 34:22.922
She's suffered
enough trauma already.

34:23.027 --> 34:24.619
We don't want
to make accusations

34:24.695 --> 34:25.855
against an innocent man.

34:25.929 --> 34:29.922
We have to do everything we can
to find some concrete evidence.

34:30.001 --> 34:31.696
He is not an innocent man.

34:31.768 --> 34:33.396
l know what he did to me.

34:33.471 --> 34:35.063
But we must have proof.

34:35.139 --> 34:37.766
And this experiment
may provide us with it.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.571
We've configured this hypospray

34:39.643 --> 34:41.804
to simulate the energy
of a thoron blast.

34:41.879 --> 34:44.245
We'll collect thin layers
of your skin tissue

34:44.315 --> 34:45.577
and examine the effects.

34:45.650 --> 34:46.810
lt won't be painful.

34:46.884 --> 34:49.216
l am not afraid.
l am angry.

34:49.286 --> 34:50.777
l know.
Try to be patient.

34:50.855 --> 34:53.322
We may have some answers soon.

34:56.159 --> 34:57.752
All right, let's see
what we've got.

35:18.883 --> 35:20.612
l think you better take a look.

35:31.028 --> 35:32.222
What do you see?

35:35.566 --> 35:39.195
The nanoprobes...
are regenerating

35:39.270 --> 35:40.464
in exactly the same pattern

35:40.538 --> 35:42.130
we saw
in Kovin's laboratory.

35:42.206 --> 35:44.674
lt appears to be
a spontaneous response

35:44.742 --> 35:45.766
which could have been caused

35:45.843 --> 35:47.640
by the energy released
from the thoron weapon.

35:47.712 --> 35:50.306
lt doesn't matter.
Kovin is guilty.

35:50.381 --> 35:51.871
Seven...

35:51.949 --> 35:53.473
there's no doubt in my mind

35:53.551 --> 35:54.779
that you believe
what you're saying,

35:54.852 --> 35:56.979
but is it possible--
just possible--

35:57.088 --> 35:59.249
that the memories you
and the Doctor recovered

35:59.323 --> 36:01.314
aren't accurate?

36:02.360 --> 36:03.725
How could that be?

36:03.794 --> 36:08.458
During your time with the Borg,
you were subjected to invasive

36:08.533 --> 36:10.023
medical procedures.

36:10.101 --> 36:11.864
You undoubtedly witnessed
other victims

36:11.936 --> 36:13.528
being assimilated.

36:13.604 --> 36:15.731
Could that be
what you're remembering?

36:17.542 --> 36:18.770
You know that's not right.

36:18.843 --> 36:19.867
Tell them.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.673
Everything led me to believe
that you were a victim.

36:22.747 --> 36:25.716
Your extreme response
to Kovin in Engineering,

36:25.783 --> 36:28.115
your irrational fear
when l was examining you...

36:28.186 --> 36:30.586
something prompted that
behavior, and l believed

36:30.655 --> 36:33.021
it was a repressed memory
of your ordeal

36:33.090 --> 36:34.182
with Kovin.

36:34.258 --> 36:35.555
That is what it was.

36:35.626 --> 36:39.426
But if l'm to be impartial,
l have to acknowledge

36:39.497 --> 36:42.557
that your neurology is still
something of a mystery to me.

36:42.633 --> 36:46.194
l can't be certain
what triggered those memories.

36:46.270 --> 36:48.704
And we can't ignore the fact

36:48.773 --> 36:51.469
that this evidence
supports Kovin's story...

36:51.542 --> 36:52.873
and not yours.

36:54.278 --> 36:57.076
You were the one who helped me
to understand what happened

36:57.148 --> 36:58.376
and now you're denying it.

36:58.449 --> 37:01.316
Seven, no one's abandoning you,
but we have to do what's right.

37:01.419 --> 37:03.910
We have to find Kovin
and tell him what we learned.

37:06.457 --> 37:08.118
The Doctor told me
l would feel better

37:08.192 --> 37:10.217
when Kovin gets
what he deserves.

37:11.295 --> 37:13.786
l want him to be punished.

37:13.864 --> 37:16.355
l won't settle
for anything less.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.341
Mr. Paris.

37:32.416 --> 37:33.906
He's in range.

37:34.018 --> 37:35.576
Visual.

37:35.653 --> 37:36.950
Hail him.

37:38.122 --> 37:39.783
No response.

37:39.857 --> 37:41.688
He's charging weapons.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.488
Open a channel--
all frequencies.

37:43.561 --> 37:45.722
Mr. Kovin,
this is Captain Janeway.

37:45.796 --> 37:49.061
We believe we've made a mistake
in accusing you.

37:49.133 --> 37:51.465
We only want to correct
the situation.

37:51.535 --> 37:53.526
Stand down your weapons.

37:55.339 --> 37:56.806
He's responding.

37:57.608 --> 37:58.836
Stop your pursuit.

37:58.909 --> 38:00.467
l can damage your ship.

38:00.578 --> 38:02.443
We're not here
to take you by force.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.277
Then let me go.

38:04.348 --> 38:05.280
Kovin, listen to me.

38:05.349 --> 38:07.613
The proceedings
must be resolved.

38:07.685 --> 38:09.175
This is a trap.

38:09.253 --> 38:10.618
No.

38:10.688 --> 38:13.122
We've discovered information
that supports your story.

38:13.190 --> 38:15.124
l don't believe you.

38:15.192 --> 38:17.160
We've reexamined the evidence.

38:17.228 --> 38:20.425
Finding the nanoprobes led us
to the wrong conclusion.

38:20.498 --> 38:23.399
We know now that your thoron
rifle did overload.

38:23.467 --> 38:24.627
Please...

38:28.639 --> 38:30.698
He's firing a spread
of photon pulses.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.277
Shields down to 82 percent.

38:35.279 --> 38:36.473
Back off.

38:36.547 --> 38:37.912
Give him some breathing room.

38:38.015 --> 38:40.245
He's coming about,
heading right for us.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.116
Direct hit to the power grid.

38:47.191 --> 38:49.125
lnnocent or not, he's going
to destroy your vessel.

38:49.193 --> 38:50.820
Captain?

38:50.895 --> 38:53.125
He's come under enough fire
from us already.

38:53.197 --> 38:54.858
Harry, try to beam him
off his ship.

38:54.932 --> 38:56.524
He's thrown up
a scattering field.

38:56.600 --> 38:57.760
l can't get a lock.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.268
Keep trying.

39:01.138 --> 39:02.571
Shields are down.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.404
He's shunting all power
to his photonic emitters.

39:05.476 --> 39:08.104
We must protect ourselves.
Disable his ship.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.807
No. Evasive maneuvers--
hard to port, full thrusters.

39:10.881 --> 39:12.041
Aye.

39:13.117 --> 39:16.280
l've almost got a lock on him--
a few more seconds.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.685
He's charging weapons again.

39:17.755 --> 39:19.848
Captain,
his emitters are overloading.

39:19.957 --> 39:21.857
All his systems
are destabilizing.

39:21.959 --> 39:22.857
Open a channel.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.190
Kovin, shut down
your scattering field.

39:25.262 --> 39:26.422
Let us beam you aboard.

39:27.832 --> 39:28.764
Kovin!

39:28.833 --> 39:29.765
He's firing.

39:37.341 --> 39:38.433
Harry?

39:40.177 --> 39:42.873
l can't find anything
to lock on to, Captain.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.580
There's nothing more
we could have done.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.252
Stand down Red Alert.

40:03.734 --> 40:07.363
Mr. Paris, set a course
back to the Entharan colony.

40:28.559 --> 40:33.656
Chief Medical Officer's Log,
Stardate 51658. 2.

40:33.731 --> 40:36.564
l've spent the past three days
being cross- examined

40:36.634 --> 40:38.602
by the Entharan authorities,

40:38.669 --> 40:41.661
but the matter
is finally resolved.

40:48.412 --> 40:49.709
Doctor.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.372
Yes.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.576
l'm here
for my weekly maintenance.

40:53.651 --> 40:55.141
Oh, of course.

40:55.219 --> 40:56.447
This way, please.

41:02.726 --> 41:03.920
Metabolic rate is stable.

41:03.994 --> 41:08.192
Electro- optic implant
is aligned.

41:09.533 --> 41:12.900
Your blood pressure
is...slightly off

41:12.970 --> 41:14.767
but within tolerance.

41:14.839 --> 41:15.931
You're in perfect health.

41:16.073 --> 41:16.937
See you next week.

41:17.074 --> 41:19.508
l do not feel perfect.

41:19.577 --> 41:21.670
What do you mean?

41:21.745 --> 41:25.237
l am preoccupied
by Kovin's death.

41:29.420 --> 41:31.354
Join the club.

41:31.422 --> 41:33.652
lt's all l can think about.

41:33.724 --> 41:36.090
As a Borg, l was responsible

41:36.160 --> 41:38.492
for the destruction
of countless millions

41:38.562 --> 41:39.654
and l felt nothing,

41:39.730 --> 41:41.391
but now...

41:41.465 --> 41:44.559
l regret the destruction
of this single being.

41:44.635 --> 41:46.728
lt's called remorse, Seven.

41:46.804 --> 41:50.638
lt comes into play
when you make a mistake...

41:50.708 --> 41:53.973
and you feel guilt
about what you've done.

41:54.044 --> 41:58.447
Another new emotion
for you to experience.

41:58.516 --> 42:02.179
l do not enjoy this remorse
any more than l enjoyed anger.

42:02.286 --> 42:04.083
Will the feeling subside?

42:04.121 --> 42:08.057
Yes...but not quickly.

42:08.125 --> 42:10.525
l would rather not have to wait.

42:10.594 --> 42:12.892
l'm afraid you don't
have much choice.

42:22.106 --> 42:23.971
But maybe l do.

42:25.576 --> 42:28.545
l've isolated the algorithms
responsible for my desire

42:28.612 --> 42:31.206
to expand beyond
my original programming.

42:32.917 --> 42:34.680
l want to delete them.

42:35.786 --> 42:37.117
Why?

42:37.187 --> 42:40.748
lt was my...urge to experiment,

42:40.824 --> 42:42.758
my infatuation
with improving myself

42:42.826 --> 42:44.259
that led to this tragedy.

42:45.963 --> 42:49.694
l fancied myself a psychologist,
a Ship's Counselor,

42:49.767 --> 42:52.565
but l wasn't prepared
for the complexities that come

42:52.636 --> 42:54.365
with such a responsibility.

42:54.438 --> 42:56.463
ln my enthusiasm
to help Seven of Nine,

42:56.540 --> 42:58.474
l lost my medical objectivity.

42:58.542 --> 43:00.976
l became
a self- righteous advocate.

43:01.078 --> 43:03.842
l didn't stop to think
for one second

43:03.881 --> 43:06.179
that l might be wrong.

43:08.519 --> 43:10.680
That mustn't happen again.

43:10.754 --> 43:12.915
You want to go back
to the state you were in

43:12.990 --> 43:15.049
when we first activated you?

43:15.125 --> 43:16.183
l'll still be capable

43:16.260 --> 43:18.626
of treating
any and all medical conditions,

43:18.696 --> 43:21.961
but without the risk
of overstepping my bounds.

43:23.167 --> 43:25.032
lt's for the best, Captain.

43:25.102 --> 43:27.127
Oh, l'm not so sure.

43:27.204 --> 43:29.934
This crew has benefited greatly

43:30.040 --> 43:32.600
from your improvements
over the years.

43:32.676 --> 43:34.610
Request denied.

43:34.678 --> 43:36.111
- Captain...
- l won't turn back

43:36.180 --> 43:38.341
the clock
because of one mistake...

43:38.415 --> 43:39.882
no matter how serious...

43:41.285 --> 43:43.913
and no matter
how you might feel.

43:52.630 --> 43:55.098
l'm a physician.

43:55.165 --> 43:58.191
l'm supposed to preserve life,
not destroy it.

44:00.037 --> 44:04.838
l can't live with the thought
that...l might do it again.

44:06.310 --> 44:07.777
With any luck...

44:09.079 --> 44:12.310
that knowledge will prevent it
from happening again.

44:12.383 --> 44:15.614
We all rallied around Seven,
Doctor, myself included.

44:18.288 --> 44:21.189
l wanted her to know that she
was part of this family,

44:21.258 --> 44:24.159
that we would support her,
fight for her no matter what.

44:24.228 --> 44:27.254
We let our good intentions
blind us.

44:28.632 --> 44:31.567
We all bear responsibility
for Kovin's death...

44:33.504 --> 44:35.563
and we all have to live with it.

44:37.775 --> 44:39.402
But to delete that burden

44:39.476 --> 44:42.502
would be the last thing
any of us should do.
