Okay, kids, go to sleep.
You've had a long, hard day.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.318
You've had a nice big glass of warm milk

01:08.402 --> 01:10.612
that may or may not
have had Benadryl in it.

01:12.364 --> 01:15.284
-So go to sleep. Shh.
-Whoo-hoo!

01:15.367 --> 01:16.201
Yes!

01:16.285 --> 01:17.995
-Yeah!
-Yes!

01:18.078 --> 01:20.247
My son kicked the winning field goal.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.498
Yay!

01:23.709 --> 01:26.420
Oh, why'd you have to wake up
the babies, huh?

01:26.503 --> 01:28.922
Oh, sorry, but it was so worth it.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.257
We were down by one,

01:30.340 --> 01:33.719
and the whole game
was riding on my golden-toed boy,

01:33.802 --> 01:35.095
and he did it.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.556
And now my alma mater
is going to the playoffs

01:37.639 --> 01:39.600
for the first time since I was there.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.978
-That's great.
-Whoa, wait, wait.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.938
Wait. They had football back then?

01:47.649 --> 01:50.485
Was your mascot a real-live dinosaur?

01:52.446 --> 01:54.406
You would be in so much trouble

01:54.489 --> 01:57.451
if you weren't the brother
of the star of the football team.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.580
Wait. Now I'm the underachieving brother?

02:03.999 --> 02:06.084
This must be what it feels like
to be Jackson.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.380
Uhh.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.135
Oh, I, I was so proud of him,

02:15.218 --> 02:19.389
and I just wanted to run out
onto the field and hug my baby.

02:20.432 --> 02:21.975
That's when we tackled her.

02:24.019 --> 02:27.773
And the whole team, they carried him
off the field on their shoulders.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.400
It's true.
I could see the coach's bald spot.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.696
-You were pretty cool under pressure.
-Wh-- pressure?

02:34.780 --> 02:38.575
Oh, my golden-toed boy
doesn't feel any pressure. Right, Jackson?

02:38.659 --> 02:41.244
You know it.
I see the ball, I kick the ball.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.455
And then I listen for the cheers.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.001
Unless you miss,
and then all you hear are boos.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.506
Speaking of booze,
I got to get to the Smash Club.

02:54.216 --> 02:57.094
Thanks for watching Pamela
while Becky's out of town.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.721
Yeah, and I'm around tomorrow
if you need me, too.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.766
That's okay. Becky set us up
on this new Daddy and Me class.

03:02.849 --> 03:06.228
It'll be nice to hang around guys
with gummy bears under their nails

03:06.311 --> 03:09.022
and spit-up stains on their collar.
You know, real men.

03:10.649 --> 03:13.694
Yeah, keep that shirt on,
and you'll fit right in.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.862
Oh, Pammy must have got yogurt on me.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.824
It's Greek yogurt, so I don't mind.

All right. Jimmy, we're gonna be late

03:27.999 --> 03:30.836
We're finally finding out
if we're having a boy or a girl.

03:30.919 --> 03:34.798
Well, I'd still rather wait.
I love surprises.

03:34.923 --> 03:38.176
That's why my favorite TV shows
are <i>Family Feud</i> and the election.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.305
Honey, the election
isn't technically a TV show.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.474
Shh, shh, shush. Don't spoil it for me.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.602
I've got all the episodes on DVR,

03:47.686 --> 03:50.439
but I've got a really good feeling
about President Gore.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.194
I still don't know why you have to know
before the baby's born.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.780
Well, I just want to know
what to prepare for.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.867
What the baby's name is,
what clothes to buy.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.579
Every time I visualize this baby,
all I see is Stewie from <i>Family Guy.</i>

04:08.248 --> 04:11.501
I can't speak for Jimmy,
but Stephanie is a grown woman.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.421
She can decide for herself
if she wants to find out.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.923
But it's a mistake if you don't.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.762
There is no surprise
about this baby's gender.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.680
I have a special gift

04:23.764 --> 04:27.934
when it comes to predicting
what the pregnant woman is carrying.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.145
He did predict
Ramona was gonna be a girl.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.856
Big whoop. He had a 50-50 shot.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.776
Doesn't make him a witch.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.278
Or does it?

04:40.113 --> 04:43.533
Just as I knew she would be a she,
I know this baby--

04:43.617 --> 04:46.536
No. Shh. Wait. I don't wanna know
the gender of the baby.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.248
Although I do kind of want to know
if you're a witch.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.628
Come on, let's go to a pond
and see if you float.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.340
I assure you I will.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.260
Steph, I want you to experience
the wonder and amazement

05:02.344 --> 05:04.095
I felt when Ramona was born.

05:04.179 --> 05:07.390
You gave birth in a rented Buick
and then had to fill up the tank

05:07.474 --> 05:09.434
so you didn't have to pay $10 a gallon.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.939
But when I saw Ramona's face
in the rotating police lights,

05:14.147 --> 05:15.690
it was love at first sight.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.986
The guy at Ampm cut the umbilical cord
with a slim jim.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.866
A homeless guy cleaned her off
with a squeegee.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.912
It really does take a village.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.292
Well, can we at least
make an event of the reveal?

05:34.376 --> 05:37.337
We're Tanners.
We don't just receive information.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.965
We need punch and snacks and a banner.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.884
Or none of those things.

05:43.718 --> 05:47.264
I know. Let's have a gender-reveal party.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.684
I'll have my doctor send the results
to a company who'll send back a balloon.

05:50.767 --> 05:54.646
Yeah, and then when you pop it,
it's filled with pink or blue confetti.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.481
Oh, I'm gonna order a banner.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.652
This is gonna happen
whether I say yes or no, right?

06:01.778 --> 06:04.906
I will give you an answer with a banner.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.704

06:25.802 --> 06:28.346
No, it's San Francisco's newspaper.

It's still about talking to your kids

I had to wrestle this guy from Oakland.
They called him the Hulk.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.025
'Cause he was huge?

20:35.109 --> 20:38.654
Oh, yeah, but more because his skin
had, like, a greenish hue.

20:39.697 --> 20:42.992
We all thought it was 'cause
he worked nights in a pesto factory.

20:44.535 --> 20:47.955
-Even my coach said I couldn't beat him.
-So you beat him, right?

20:48.038 --> 20:51.333

20:52.668 --> 20:55.921

50-pound bags of pine nuts everywhere.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.675
-Where are you going with this?
-Oh.

21:01.719 --> 21:05.765
Hulk told me I was the toughest opponent
he had ever faced.

21:05.848 --> 21:08.642
He brought me a nice penne with pesto
to the hospital.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.812
Lucky for him that he visited, too,

21:11.896 --> 21:14.940
because it turned out it wasn't the pesto
that was turning his skin green.

21:15.024 --> 21:17.067
It was fungus from a dirty wrestling mat.

21:17.151 --> 21:20.946

$5 million to go away.

21:25.576 --> 21:28.621
Yeah, okay. Sorry. Sorry. My point.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.457
My point, in a roundabout sorta way is...

21:32.249 --> 21:33.459
you got a talent.

21:33.542 --> 21:37.338
Sometimes you owe it to yourself
to see how far that talent could take you.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.007
But what if I mess up
and let everyone down?

21:40.758 --> 21:45.262
Well, the only people you would be
letting down is your team, if you quit.

21:45.346 --> 21:48.557
I'm not letting you quit
because you made a commitment.

-Of course I think you can.

might make me feel more in control, but...
