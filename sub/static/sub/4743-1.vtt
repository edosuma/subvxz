00:45.379 --> 00:47.840
For more than 200 years...

00:48.298 --> 00:50.551
...we Owens women
have been blamed...

00:50.843 --> 00:54.430
...for everything that has
ever gone wrong in this town.

00:54.472 --> 00:57.308
Is that why people hate us
so much, Aunt Frances?

00:57.559 --> 01:02.105
They don't hate us, sweetheart.
We just make them a little nervous.

01:02.397 --> 01:06.610
Let's face it, Jet. We Owens women
have always created a stir.

01:07.278 --> 01:10.114
It all began with
your ancestor, Maria.

01:10.948 --> 01:14.493
She was a witch.
The first in our family.

01:14.702 --> 01:16.872
And you, my darlings,
are the most recent...

01:17.038 --> 01:18.874
...in a long and distinguished line.

01:19.291 --> 01:22.252
Is that why they wanted to hang her?
Because she was a witch?

01:23.044 --> 01:27.216
The fact that our Aunt Maria was
a bit of a heartbreaker didn't help.

01:27.675 --> 01:29.594
Nor did it help that
most of her lovers...

01:29.886 --> 01:32.513
...had wives on the hanging committee.

01:32.680 --> 01:37.059
But no, I don't think it was
either of those reasons.

01:37.435 --> 01:40.898
They feared her
because she had a gift.

01:41.773 --> 01:46.111
A power that has been passed
on to you children.

01:46.987 --> 01:48.906
She had the gift...

01:49.156 --> 01:50.741
...of magic.

01:57.542 --> 01:59.742
Practical Magic

02:04.840 --> 02:06.926
And it was this very gift...

02:07.301 --> 02:08.969
...that saved her life.

02:25.445 --> 02:27.907
She was banished
to this very island.

02:28.991 --> 02:32.203
With her unborn child
growing inside her belly...

02:32.370 --> 02:34.372
...she waited for her lover
to rescue her.

02:35.665 --> 02:37.500
But he never came.

02:38.627 --> 02:40.254
No one came.

02:42.256 --> 02:43.966
In a moment of despair...

02:44.258 --> 02:46.802
...she cast a spell upon herself:

02:47.052 --> 02:48.429
She would never again...

02:48.929 --> 02:51.224
...feel the agony of love.

02:51.266 --> 02:53.476
But as her bitterness grew...

02:53.768 --> 02:56.479
...the spell turned into a curse.

02:56.729 --> 03:01.568
A curse on any man
who dared love an Owens woman.

03:05.614 --> 03:07.491
Is that why Daddy died?

03:07.783 --> 03:08.909
From the curse?

03:09.160 --> 03:11.036
Yes, my darling.

03:14.875 --> 03:16.585
Your mother knew.

03:17.419 --> 03:21.131
She heard the beetle ticking
for your father's death all day long.

03:21.506 --> 03:24.926
She knew that when you hear
the sound of the deathwatch beetle...

03:25.093 --> 03:28.055
...the man you love
is doomed to die.

03:33.060 --> 03:35.229
But that's how you came
to live with us.

03:35.271 --> 03:37.106
We tucked you into our lives then.

03:37.356 --> 03:40.652
We've raised you
the best way we know how.

03:40.903 --> 03:44.156
In this house, we have
chocolate cake for breakfast.

03:44.406 --> 03:47.993
We never bother with silly things
like bedtimes or brushing our teeth.

03:48.535 --> 03:50.497
But with the sweets...

03:50.747 --> 03:52.332
...comes the sour.

03:52.624 --> 03:55.710
So when you find yourself
the center of attention...

03:56.002 --> 03:57.003
You want to play?

03:57.462 --> 04:00.548
It's not that they hate you.
It's that, well...

04:01.216 --> 04:02.301
We're different.

04:02.551 --> 04:03.969
You witch!

04:06.013 --> 04:09.183
Witch! Witch!
You're a bitch!

04:20.362 --> 04:21.571
Gillian.

04:21.863 --> 04:22.781
Sally.

04:24.116 --> 04:26.285
The only curse in this family...

04:26.536 --> 04:29.080
...is sitting right there
at the end of the table.

04:29.330 --> 04:30.456
Your Aunt Fanny.

04:30.707 --> 04:33.042
Come on, Jetty,
even you have to admit...

04:33.251 --> 04:35.420
...any man who gets involved
with an Owens woman...

04:35.670 --> 04:37.296
...is bound to end up
6 feet under.

04:37.631 --> 04:38.799
Spare me.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.385
What about my poor Ethan?

04:41.677 --> 04:42.428
An accident.

04:42.678 --> 04:43.512
It was fate.

04:43.762 --> 04:44.638
It was an accident.

04:44.888 --> 04:45.848
It was fate.

04:46.181 --> 04:47.349
- Accident!
- Fate!

04:49.436 --> 04:52.063
Mommy died of a broken heart,
didn't she?

04:54.774 --> 04:57.318
Yes, my darling girl, she did.

05:02.950 --> 05:05.161
My little witch...

05:05.745 --> 05:07.997
...Let's go inside
and do some spells.

05:08.414 --> 05:11.042
- What about my homework?
- Pish!

05:11.375 --> 05:14.171
Tosh! You'll both learn things
in this house...

05:14.421 --> 05:16.131
...you'll never learn in school.

05:16.882 --> 05:18.008
Let's go.

05:18.967 --> 05:19.926
Come on, Gilly!

05:20.177 --> 05:21.803
I'm coming, Sally!

05:25.183 --> 05:27.435
Very good, Sally!

05:27.769 --> 05:30.313
You've been blessed with a gift.

05:30.646 --> 05:31.689
What about me?

05:31.939 --> 05:34.525
We don't worry about you, Gilly-Bean.

05:34.776 --> 05:37.279
Your talents will emerge in time.

05:42.993 --> 05:46.955
Sally, you just stay right there.
Keep working on your spells.

05:47.623 --> 05:50.001
Just keep working on your spells.

05:53.713 --> 05:54.714
Get the bird.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.216
Get the book.

05:58.718 --> 06:02.139
I want him so much,
I can't think about anything else.

06:02.390 --> 06:03.641
I don't sleep.

06:04.475 --> 06:07.311
He has to leave his wife.
He has to leave her now.

06:07.603 --> 06:09.897
Perhaps you might find
one better suited.

06:10.147 --> 06:13.485
I don't want anyone else.
He's all I think about.

06:13.777 --> 06:15.404
Why else would I come here?

06:15.654 --> 06:17.531
Take the money, Jet.

06:27.083 --> 06:29.544
I want him to want me so much
he can't stand it.

06:37.803 --> 06:40.180
Be careful what you wish for.

06:46.645 --> 06:49.232
I hope I never fall in love.
I hope I never fall in love.

06:49.482 --> 06:52.694
I hope I never fall in love.
I hope I never fall in love.

06:52.986 --> 06:55.363
I can't wait to fall in love.

06:56.031 --> 06:58.700
He will hear my call a mile away.

06:59.868 --> 07:01.996
He will whistle my favorite song.

07:03.622 --> 07:05.374
He can ride a pony backwards.

07:05.666 --> 07:06.417
What are you doing?

07:06.667 --> 07:08.794
Summoning up a true love spell...

07:09.045 --> 07:10.421
...called Amas Veritas.

07:11.130 --> 07:13.842
He can flip pancakes in the air.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.139
He'll be marvelously kind.

07:20.349 --> 07:22.392
And his favorite shape...

07:22.893 --> 07:24.145
...will be a star.

07:30.860 --> 07:32.403
And he'll have...

07:32.820 --> 07:34.489
...one green eye...

07:39.328 --> 07:40.871
...and one blue.

07:47.127 --> 07:49.714
Thought you never wanted
to fall in love.

07:50.507 --> 07:52.092
That's the point.

07:52.342 --> 07:54.886
The guy I dreamed of doesn't exist.

07:55.136 --> 07:59.224
And if he doesn't exist,
I'll never die of a broken heart.

08:27.505 --> 08:29.424
And if he doesn't exist...

08:29.674 --> 08:32.010
...I'll never die of a broken heart.

08:35.764 --> 08:37.015
Get the door!

08:45.566 --> 08:47.485
Sal, you have...

08:47.736 --> 08:49.404
...no idea!

08:50.572 --> 08:53.283
Do you love him enough
to marry him?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.285
Come on, Sal, what's enough?

08:55.535 --> 08:56.995
I hate it here.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.166
I want to go where no one's
even heard of us.

09:00.416 --> 09:02.251
I feel like I'll never
see you again.

09:02.501 --> 09:03.628
Of course you will.

09:03.878 --> 09:05.338
We'll grow old together.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.215
It'll be you and me
living in a big house.

09:08.466 --> 09:11.011
These two old biddies
with all these cats.

09:11.303 --> 09:13.722
I bet we even die on the same day.

09:14.056 --> 09:15.307
You swear?

09:17.309 --> 09:17.935
Honey...

09:18.185 --> 09:19.978
...I need your pocketknife.

09:24.067 --> 09:24.859
Here.

09:27.654 --> 09:28.863
My blood.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.242
Your blood.

09:36.247 --> 09:37.539
Our blood.

09:42.795 --> 09:44.129
I love you, Gilly-Bean.

09:45.923 --> 09:47.592
I love you too.

10:00.064 --> 10:02.858
- Good morning.
- Hello, boys.

10:03.359 --> 10:04.777
Charlie, looking good!

10:06.445 --> 10:08.030
God, what was I thinking?

10:08.281 --> 10:09.782
Franny, let it go.

10:10.032 --> 10:13.412
My goodness, Gillian's in Orlando!
She's in Orlando.

10:13.662 --> 10:15.664
I guess that
Roto-Rooter man is history.

10:15.873 --> 10:17.749
- According to that, he is.
- It's insane.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.335
She keeps going through
all these guys.

10:20.586 --> 10:24.132
Hopefully, someday she'll find
a guy who'll go through her.

10:26.718 --> 10:28.469
Hello, darling. How are you?

10:28.678 --> 10:30.513
Oh, Jet, just give it up.

10:30.763 --> 10:31.723
Never.

10:31.973 --> 10:33.016
God, I miss her.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.144
Oh, sweetie!

10:36.729 --> 10:37.980
Oh, dear!

10:42.818 --> 10:45.905
Oh, Samson!
Now just knock it off.

10:46.573 --> 10:48.283
All I want is a normal life.

10:48.533 --> 10:50.368
Darling, when will you understand...

10:50.619 --> 10:53.330
...that being normal
is not necessarily a virtue.

10:53.580 --> 10:55.040
It denotes a lack of courage.

10:55.290 --> 10:56.208
It's what I want.

10:56.458 --> 10:59.712
See this couple? He's having an
affair with the babysitter.

10:59.962 --> 11:02.715
And she can eat a pound cake
in under a minute.

11:14.102 --> 11:15.312
Sorry!

11:30.119 --> 11:31.120
What time is it?

11:31.371 --> 11:32.372
Any moment now.

11:52.561 --> 11:54.145
Where are you going, dear?

11:54.437 --> 11:56.273
Most excellent.

12:29.851 --> 12:31.186
Dear Gillian:

12:31.436 --> 12:33.647
Today is our
third anniversary...

12:34.023 --> 12:37.318
...and all I have to show for it
are two beautiful little girls...

12:37.568 --> 12:41.071
...and a husband
I just can't stop kissing.

12:41.864 --> 12:44.492
I don't even mind the beard.

12:45.035 --> 12:46.661
I wish you could see us.

12:47.537 --> 12:51.249
No more stones being thrown,
no taunts cried out.

12:52.083 --> 12:55.378
Everything is just so blissfully...

12:55.712 --> 12:56.881
...normal.

12:57.882 --> 12:59.842
Life is perfect.

13:03.221 --> 13:04.847
Dear Sal:

13:07.099 --> 13:09.269
I'm lying in the sun.

13:10.938 --> 13:13.106
I'm hanging by the pool.

13:13.565 --> 13:15.776
I've got a million friends.

13:16.652 --> 13:18.111
You might say...

13:18.362 --> 13:20.155
...that life is...

13:20.447 --> 13:21.699
...perfect.

13:27.872 --> 13:29.999
But I don't care
about any of it.

13:30.250 --> 13:33.087
In fact, I only have
two words to say to you:

13:35.089 --> 13:36.632
Jimmy Angelov.

13:37.758 --> 13:39.301
Jimmy...

13:39.677 --> 13:40.928
...Angelov.

14:31.566 --> 14:32.568
Angel.

14:32.818 --> 14:34.945
Angelov, Angelov.

15:18.367 --> 15:20.036
Where are you?

15:20.328 --> 15:21.996
Don't do this to me.

15:22.914 --> 15:24.666
Come on! Come on!

15:24.916 --> 15:27.585
- Hey, boys, catch anything today?
- Not much.

15:27.836 --> 15:28.670
See you in a bit.

15:35.010 --> 15:36.512
Jimmy, what's going on?

15:36.762 --> 15:37.847
I hear you.

15:39.140 --> 15:40.391
I hear you.

15:40.641 --> 15:41.684
Don't!

15:42.309 --> 15:43.185
How's Mary doing?

15:43.437 --> 15:44.271
She's good?

15:50.402 --> 15:51.903
That can't be. No!

15:56.909 --> 15:58.286
What's that?

15:59.245 --> 16:00.788
I know you're in there.

16:03.916 --> 16:04.834
Michael, look out!

16:06.044 --> 16:07.713
Look out behind you!

16:08.630 --> 16:09.715
On your right!

16:51.343 --> 16:53.679
It was the curse, wasn't it?

16:54.513 --> 16:57.558
He died because
I loved him so much!

16:57.809 --> 16:59.310
My poor little girl.

17:07.653 --> 17:09.696
We had no idea...

17:09.946 --> 17:11.615
...when we cast the spell...

17:11.865 --> 17:14.201
What spell?
What are you talking about?

17:18.454 --> 17:19.790
You didn't!

17:20.875 --> 17:22.460
Please tell me...

17:22.752 --> 17:24.462
...that my own flesh and blood-

17:24.796 --> 17:26.923
It was just a little push.

17:27.173 --> 17:28.967
You wanted so much to be happy.

17:29.259 --> 17:31.679
We never expected
that you'd truly love him.

17:31.929 --> 17:33.472
Well, I did.

17:33.723 --> 17:35.182
And I want him back.

17:40.771 --> 17:43.025
You brought him into my life.
You bring him back!

17:43.275 --> 17:46.153
Bring him back!
I've never asked you for anything!

17:46.403 --> 17:49.323
I never asked for spells, but do
this! You can bring him back.

17:49.573 --> 17:50.699
No, dear.

17:50.991 --> 17:51.950
We won't do that.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.285
We don't do that.

17:53.535 --> 17:55.913
You can do this.
I know you can. I remember.

17:56.122 --> 17:58.249
I found it here when Mommy
and Daddy died.

17:59.125 --> 18:02.045
Even if we did bring him back,
it wouldn't be Michael.

18:02.337 --> 18:04.505
It'd be something else.
Something dark...

18:05.214 --> 18:06.216
...and unnatural.

18:06.467 --> 18:10.721
I don't care what he comes back as.
As long as he comes back.

18:10.971 --> 18:13.807
Please do this for me.
Please!

18:17.561 --> 18:18.855
Please!

18:28.740 --> 18:31.327
This is only temporary.
Don't get too comfortable.

18:31.577 --> 18:32.912
No chocolate for breakfast.

18:33.162 --> 18:35.289
Homework will be done
after dinner.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.583
Teeth and hair brushed
before bed.

18:40.211 --> 18:42.047
And as for you two...

18:42.297 --> 18:44.841
...my children will never do magic.

18:45.175 --> 18:46.385
Ever.

19:02.485 --> 19:03.778
Mom?

19:06.907 --> 19:08.909
It's time for us to go to school.

19:10.327 --> 19:11.787
Mommy.

19:14.665 --> 19:16.458
It's the same time
as yesterday...

19:16.709 --> 19:19.879
...and the day before that,
and the day before that.

19:22.549 --> 19:24.134
Out of bed, sleepyhead!

19:25.885 --> 19:27.846
I'm worried about Antonia.

19:28.555 --> 19:29.473
Do you know...

19:29.724 --> 19:33.519
...she puts on her mouse ears,
she drives around town all liquored up.

19:33.978 --> 19:35.146
Naked!

19:41.445 --> 19:42.404
All right...

19:42.654 --> 19:44.364
...I'll see you around.

19:45.449 --> 19:46.950
Come here, you!

19:50.829 --> 19:53.499
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm just so...

19:53.958 --> 19:55.293
...tired.

19:56.711 --> 19:58.296
It's okay, Mommy.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.402
Gilly.

20:23.865 --> 20:24.950
Sally.

20:36.879 --> 20:39.006
I was just thinking about you.

20:39.674 --> 20:41.969
You're always thinking about me.

20:57.860 --> 21:00.863
Honey, I just have to go
to the bathroom.

21:05.869 --> 21:07.329
Let's go together.

21:07.580 --> 21:09.373
Jimmy, come on.

21:09.915 --> 21:11.375
I'm just kidding.

21:12.084 --> 21:13.252
Go.

21:48.165 --> 21:51.251
You're in my blood like holy wine

21:51.960 --> 21:54.881
You taste so bitter and so sweet

21:56.591 --> 21:59.177
I could drink a case of you

22:04.975 --> 22:07.269
Still I'd be on my feet

22:39.345 --> 22:41.890
I was really, really happy.

22:51.734 --> 22:54.112
We were going to open
a botanical shop.

22:54.362 --> 22:56.823
He'd get the ingredients,
and I'd make the stuff.

22:57.073 --> 23:00.618
He really loved my
mint-oatmeal shaving cream.

23:00.910 --> 23:02.704
He couldn't stop eating it.

23:03.329 --> 23:06.375
I'm sure all this is really
boring to you...

23:07.418 --> 23:08.669
...but he made me laugh.

23:08.919 --> 23:10.379
What kind of name is Angelov?

23:10.671 --> 23:12.214
Bulgarian.

23:13.799 --> 23:15.594
Bulgarian?

23:17.554 --> 23:20.932
He's from somewhere
near Transylvania.

23:23.059 --> 23:24.644
He has this whole...

23:24.895 --> 23:28.232
...Dracula-cowboy thing about him.

23:29.650 --> 23:32.445
He's just so intense.
I mean...

23:33.571 --> 23:37.200
...he talks about our relationship
in terms of centuries.

23:37.492 --> 23:39.870
Sometimes we just stay up all night...

23:40.120 --> 23:42.122
...worshipping each other...

23:42.956 --> 23:44.708
...like bats.

23:47.544 --> 23:50.714
Thank God for Jet's belladonna...

23:51.424 --> 23:53.259
...or I'd never get any sleep.

23:53.635 --> 23:55.261
Why are you taking
that stuff?

23:55.553 --> 23:59.307
I'm not using it. I just give
it to him every now and then.

23:59.974 --> 24:04.021
So you're drugging your boyfriend
to get a little shuteye?

24:06.690 --> 24:08.484
Doesn't that seem
strange to you?

24:08.901 --> 24:09.944
Maybe.

24:10.861 --> 24:12.404
And he's strong.

24:13.656 --> 24:15.742
So much stronger than me.

24:16.159 --> 24:18.537
He can survive the curse.

24:28.047 --> 24:30.258
Do you forgive our mother?

24:32.343 --> 24:33.886
Sometimes.

24:36.681 --> 24:39.017
You'll never forgive yourself...

24:39.351 --> 24:40.602
...unless you get up...

24:40.853 --> 24:42.980
...and you get dressed...

24:43.522 --> 24:46.733
...and brush your goddamn teeth,
because your breath stinks...

24:50.195 --> 24:52.949
...and you take care of
those little girls.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.034
Yeah, you're right.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.426
I love you.

25:12.970 --> 25:15.390
I love you too, Gilly-Bean.

25:59.562 --> 26:01.564
Opening Soon

26:34.350 --> 26:37.228
How's your wicked mommy doing?

26:37.478 --> 26:39.857
Witch! Witch! You're a witch!

26:42.151 --> 26:44.987
You'd think after 300 years,
they'd make up a better rhyme.

26:49.366 --> 26:50.910
Your troublemaker
started this.

26:51.161 --> 26:53.037
- I hate you!
- Put the finger down, Kylie.

26:53.288 --> 26:54.456
I hope you get...

26:56.666 --> 26:57.625
...chickenpox!

27:01.881 --> 27:02.965
She was just kidding.

27:03.382 --> 27:05.176
No, she wasn't, Mom.

27:05.676 --> 27:07.762
She was not kidding.

27:08.012 --> 27:09.847
What's wrong with you?
We do not cast.

27:10.097 --> 27:13.142
We do not toy with people's lives.
This is not a game.

27:13.393 --> 27:16.688
No, you don't cast! You probably
couldn't even if you tried!

27:19.816 --> 27:22.235
She has all this power
and doesn't use it!

27:22.652 --> 27:25.113
I think you really hurt
Mom's feelings.

27:26.449 --> 27:29.410
Kylie thinks any man who
marries us is going to croak.

27:29.702 --> 27:31.621
That's such hogwash.

27:31.871 --> 27:34.957
What about your grandparents,
Jack and Regina?

27:35.291 --> 27:39.505
Grandma Regina died
of a broken heart, didn't she?

27:40.631 --> 27:42.633
How could she do that?

27:43.217 --> 27:46.136
Leave Mom and Aunt Gilly behind
when they were little?

27:46.428 --> 27:47.763
Why won't she talk about it?

27:48.013 --> 27:51.768
Was Mama good at spells as a girl?
Why won't she do spells now?

27:52.018 --> 27:53.144
What's going on here?

27:53.603 --> 27:54.396
Nothing.

27:54.646 --> 27:56.773
Just making toast, is all.

28:01.153 --> 28:02.321
Finish your homework?

28:03.739 --> 28:06.325
A storm's coming.
Go check the windows for me.

28:14.418 --> 28:15.419
Making toast?

28:18.672 --> 28:21.466
I want you to watch
what you say to those girls.

28:21.717 --> 28:24.721
I don't want you filling
their heads with your nonsense.

28:25.388 --> 28:27.265
We'd never tell them nonsense.

28:30.101 --> 28:31.811
Good night, sweetie.

28:35.356 --> 28:36.900
Dearest Gilly:

28:39.611 --> 28:42.156
Sometimes I feel
there's a hole inside of me...

28:44.283 --> 28:46.410
...an emptiness that
at times...

28:46.660 --> 28:48.455
...seems to burn.

28:49.622 --> 28:54.169
I think if you lifted my heart
to your ear, you could hear the ocean.

28:55.712 --> 28:58.465
And the moon tonight,
there's a circle around it.

28:58.715 --> 29:01.218
A sign of trouble
not far behind.

29:01.761 --> 29:04.221
I have this dream of being whole.

29:04.680 --> 29:07.600
Of not going to sleep
each night wanting.

29:08.225 --> 29:12.856
But still, sometimes when the wind
is warm or the crickets sing...

29:13.398 --> 29:17.778
...I dream of a love that even time
will lie down and be still for.

29:19.279 --> 29:21.490
Ijust want someone
to love me.

29:22.032 --> 29:23.825
I want to be seen.

29:28.790 --> 29:32.293
I don't know.
Maybe I've had my happiness.

29:34.504 --> 29:36.465
I don't want to believe it...

29:37.758 --> 29:39.802
...but there is no man, Gilly.

29:41.345 --> 29:42.763
Only that moon.

29:52.315 --> 29:53.566
Gillian!

29:57.195 --> 29:58.071
- It's Gillian.
- I know.

29:58.363 --> 29:59.280
What's wrong?

29:59.572 --> 30:02.326
I'm scared.
Can you come and get me?

30:02.618 --> 30:03.703
Where are you?

30:04.036 --> 30:06.622
I'm taking the first flight out.
Watch the kids.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.875
Just go to Gilly.
The children'll be fine.

30:10.167 --> 30:12.296
We'll take them to
the solstice celebration.

30:12.546 --> 30:14.548
Why can't you two
just stay here?

30:14.965 --> 30:17.384
We can't back out.
We're on the committee.

30:17.634 --> 30:18.593
We're presenting.

30:19.011 --> 30:21.305
I don't want them dancing naked
under the moon.

30:21.555 --> 30:23.056
No, of course not, dear.

30:23.307 --> 30:26.728
Nudity is entirely optional,
as you well remember!

30:33.443 --> 30:34.736
Hello!

31:00.598 --> 31:02.224
Gilly, I'm here.

31:03.184 --> 31:04.101
Thanks, Sal.

31:04.352 --> 31:05.269
Hi.

31:07.355 --> 31:09.649
The room service here sucks.

31:11.193 --> 31:12.778
Let's get you out of here.

31:13.779 --> 31:14.696
I'm fine.

31:21.703 --> 31:23.414
He's been really crazy.

31:23.665 --> 31:26.292
We've been driving
for two weeks straight.

31:26.542 --> 31:30.004
Not even straight.
In these zigzags, back and forth.

31:30.463 --> 31:32.298
Damn these shoes!

31:32.548 --> 31:35.719
Then today he says
he wants a jelly doughnut.

31:35.970 --> 31:39.098
And he says to the kid,
"Jelly doughnut, with cream. "

31:39.348 --> 31:41.225
And the kid looked confused.

31:41.475 --> 31:43.686
And I said,
"Jimmy, jelly's not a cream. "

31:43.936 --> 31:47.023
Then the kid laughed and I laughed
and then he punched me.

31:47.315 --> 31:49.859
He punched me real hard.
The bastard!

31:51.069 --> 31:52.737
Blood on the moon.

31:53.488 --> 31:55.740
- I know.
- Blood on the moon.

31:55.991 --> 31:57.409
I know. Get in the car.

31:57.659 --> 32:00.079
Where's my tiger's eye?
It brings me luck.

32:00.329 --> 32:01.789
- Is it in here?
- I left it.

32:02.039 --> 32:04.500
- I need my tiger's eye!
- It's probably in the bag!

32:06.544 --> 32:08.004
Gillian, come on!

32:20.517 --> 32:21.893
Honey, just forget-

32:23.271 --> 32:24.314
You drive.

32:36.201 --> 32:37.411
You want some?

32:39.079 --> 32:39.955
Nope?

32:49.215 --> 32:50.592
You ever read any books...

32:50.842 --> 32:52.427
...by Louis L'Amour?

32:57.307 --> 32:59.227
Louis L'Amour...

32:59.518 --> 33:01.103
...was a foreigner...

33:01.687 --> 33:04.065
...and he loved all things cowboy.

33:05.066 --> 33:06.692
Just like me, Jimmy-Boy.

33:09.779 --> 33:12.824
Louis would write
stories about rustlers.

33:13.075 --> 33:14.243
Rustlers...

33:14.660 --> 33:16.745
...who were really bad guys.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.540
The belladonna is in my bag.

33:21.124 --> 33:23.836
They would try to steal the cattle.

33:25.004 --> 33:27.090
But before they could sell them...

33:27.799 --> 33:32.011
...they would try to take away
the brand of the owner with an acid...

33:32.428 --> 33:33.763
...or by...

33:34.431 --> 33:35.641
...scrubbing.

33:36.141 --> 33:39.061
Unfortunately, they could
never get rid of it.

33:39.311 --> 33:41.689
So they would be caught
and get hanged.

33:41.939 --> 33:43.065
What are you doing?

33:43.440 --> 33:44.483
Come on.

33:44.775 --> 33:46.903
You can't hide the brand.

33:47.195 --> 33:48.405
It's just you and me.

33:50.448 --> 33:51.408
Watch the road!

33:51.658 --> 33:52.367
Shut up!

33:52.617 --> 33:56.663
Rustlers and branding!
Louis L'Amour! Who is not a foreigner!

33:56.913 --> 33:59.500
He's from North Dakota,
you asshole!

33:59.750 --> 34:02.503
- Watch the road!
- You're freaking me out, Dracula freak!

34:02.753 --> 34:05.381
Give me the bottle
before I plow you into a truck...

34:05.631 --> 34:07.925
...just to get you to shut up!

34:08.175 --> 34:09.553
Calm down!

34:14.683 --> 34:15.559
You know, girls...

34:19.021 --> 34:22.275
...I am feeling very into
sisters right now.

34:28.739 --> 34:31.201
You were always on my mind

34:33.661 --> 34:36.165
You were always on my mind

34:39.502 --> 34:41.712
He should've passed out by now.

34:42.087 --> 34:44.965
- You didn't give him enough.
- I gave him plenty.

35:00.858 --> 35:02.318
What's he going to do?

35:02.568 --> 35:03.903
Just stay calm.

35:08.366 --> 35:10.369
If I made you feel

35:11.078 --> 35:12.454
Second best

35:13.038 --> 35:13.956
I'm so sorry

35:14.373 --> 35:15.958
I was blind

35:17.042 --> 35:19.253
You were always on my mind

35:21.214 --> 35:22.966
Jimmy, please, baby.

35:23.216 --> 35:24.384
Come on.

35:24.968 --> 35:27.929
- Come on, baby, I love you.
- I'm so sorry, my love.

35:28.221 --> 35:29.848
I want to be with you forever.

35:30.098 --> 35:31.641
Jimmy, please.

35:50.495 --> 35:51.872
He's out.
He's passed out.

35:52.164 --> 35:53.165
Oh, God!

35:54.916 --> 35:56.168
Oh, my God!

35:57.503 --> 35:59.005
How much did you give him?

35:59.297 --> 36:02.633
I wasn't using a measuring cup!
He tried to kill you!

36:03.468 --> 36:04.552
Come on!

36:11.185 --> 36:14.855
Please, God, if you get us out of this,
I'll be good. I'll have babies.

36:15.147 --> 36:17.399
I have babies, Gillian.

36:17.649 --> 36:19.026
I had normal.

36:19.318 --> 36:21.529
I worked really hard
to get that normal.

36:21.821 --> 36:25.366
It's all my fault, Sally.
I didn't mean to ruin your life.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.327
I just had no one else
to turn to.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.037
Get in the car.

36:30.371 --> 36:32.333
Get in the car.

36:38.839 --> 36:41.300
We have to go to the police.
It was self-defense.

36:42.551 --> 36:45.639
The old slowly-poison-him-to-death
self-defense?

36:45.931 --> 36:49.100
Come on, Sally,
they're never going to believe us.

36:50.435 --> 36:52.312
You should stop smoking so much.

36:53.188 --> 36:54.106
Why?

36:54.564 --> 36:56.192
I'll probably get life.

36:56.442 --> 36:58.903
I should smoke two at once.
It'll shorten the sentence.

37:00.321 --> 37:02.865
I really don't want
to lose my children.

37:06.119 --> 37:07.036
I know.

37:08.247 --> 37:10.207
I don't want you to either.

37:25.557 --> 37:26.850
What are you thinking?

37:28.393 --> 37:31.772
When Michael died, you asked
the aunts to bring him back.

37:32.565 --> 37:33.607
But they wouldn't.

37:33.941 --> 37:36.110
Wouldn't, but not couldn't.

37:36.402 --> 37:40.156
They were right. He'd come back
as something dark and unnatural.

37:40.406 --> 37:43.743
Jimmy already is dark and unnatural.
I don't care what he comes back as.

37:43.994 --> 37:46.913
No, that is not an option.
That is not a choice.

37:47.205 --> 37:50.459
We don't have a choice!
This is our choice!

37:57.925 --> 37:59.010
You...

37:59.260 --> 38:00.344
...owe me...

38:00.887 --> 38:02.138
...big time.

38:08.687 --> 38:11.023
He's going to be so pissed.

38:16.737 --> 38:18.280
Okay, here we go.

38:27.332 --> 38:29.042
- Watch his balls.
- You watch them!

38:32.296 --> 38:33.672
Spell book.

38:45.143 --> 38:47.729
Okay, Jimmy,
I will get you out of this...

38:48.563 --> 38:51.942
...but when I do,
we are definitely breaking up.

38:52.192 --> 38:54.027
It is over.

38:55.780 --> 38:57.740
What are you doing?

38:58.658 --> 38:59.742
Nothing.

39:03.621 --> 39:05.039
Are you sure...

39:05.289 --> 39:06.959
...you want to do this?

39:10.254 --> 39:11.839
Absolutely.

39:21.766 --> 39:26.354
"Lips pursed, emit wind over tongue
in motion, teeth on edge. "

39:32.111 --> 39:33.320
Good enough, good enough.

39:33.571 --> 39:37.283
"Touch bounded smudge of blue sage
with braided wheat straw.

39:37.992 --> 39:41.037
Insert needles
through eyes of corpse. "

39:41.620 --> 39:43.498
- Through the eye?
- In the eye.

39:50.088 --> 39:50.881
No way!

39:51.131 --> 39:53.508
I think we should wait
for the aunts.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.845
It's not like
he's going to stay fresh.

39:56.095 --> 39:57.680
It's now or never.

39:58.264 --> 40:02.226
I need for you to get me something
white to write on top of the star.

40:02.477 --> 40:03.644
Chop-chop!

40:05.313 --> 40:07.149
This is all I could find.

40:07.483 --> 40:10.194
This is actually brilliant.
This is good.

40:11.070 --> 40:12.363
Now we're supposed to say:

40:13.280 --> 40:14.406
"Black as night...

40:14.656 --> 40:16.575
...erase death from our sight.

40:17.159 --> 40:18.411
White as light.

40:19.329 --> 40:20.997
Mighty Hectate make it right. "

40:21.623 --> 40:23.166
Black as night.

40:23.416 --> 40:24.501
White as light.

40:25.251 --> 40:27.879
White as light.
Mighty Hectate make it right.

40:28.588 --> 40:29.673
White as light.

40:30.675 --> 40:32.468
Black as night.

40:32.927 --> 40:34.845
Erase death from our sight.

40:35.721 --> 40:40.101
White as light.
Mighty Hectate make it right.

41:14.763 --> 41:16.432
I want you to be my wife!

41:17.099 --> 41:18.393
Can you promise me that?

41:19.185 --> 41:20.729
I want you to be my wife!

41:22.439 --> 41:24.190
I want you to be my wife!

41:59.062 --> 42:02.231
You have the worst taste in men.

42:09.156 --> 42:12.326
I know this sounds
really stupid right now...

42:12.576 --> 42:13.786
...but I just...

42:14.411 --> 42:16.538
I just really wanted to say...

42:18.041 --> 42:19.501
...thank you.

42:24.923 --> 42:26.466
Thanks for being my sister.

42:27.008 --> 42:28.301
It's all right.

42:28.551 --> 42:31.347
Let's just put this
all behind us now.

42:34.433 --> 42:36.268
What will we tell the aunts?

42:38.896 --> 42:39.981
Nothing.

43:18.440 --> 43:19.858
They're here.

43:20.900 --> 43:22.694
What if they don't like me?

43:23.236 --> 43:26.239
You won't believe it!
We danced naked under the full moon!

43:26.489 --> 43:27.490
It was so fun!

43:27.782 --> 43:29.327
- We did!
- So cool!

43:31.829 --> 43:32.580
Oh, my God!

43:32.872 --> 43:34.582
Aunt Gilly's home!

43:39.462 --> 43:43.342
You guys are so big!
I can't believe this!

43:48.847 --> 43:50.557
Hi, Aunt Frances.

43:51.266 --> 43:53.394
My darling little girl.

43:55.730 --> 43:56.564
Oh, dear!

43:59.734 --> 44:02.445
A little mugwort
will fix that right up.

44:04.240 --> 44:05.241
Kylie...

44:05.491 --> 44:08.327
...why don't you and I
just go to the greenhouse?

44:09.078 --> 44:11.747
I'm so happy to see you, sweetie.

44:14.750 --> 44:16.378
Don't you worry, dear.

44:16.670 --> 44:19.214
Whoever he was,
he'll get what he deserves.

44:22.175 --> 44:25.595
I think a brownie for breakfast
would fix you right up.

44:25.845 --> 44:26.930
A brownie?

44:27.180 --> 44:28.349
You're still doing that?

44:28.641 --> 44:30.476
You've been away too long.

44:30.726 --> 44:32.019
Some things never change.

44:32.395 --> 44:34.855
Too long you have been away.

44:35.106 --> 44:35.940
Where are they?

44:45.951 --> 44:47.911
I love this stuff.

44:49.663 --> 44:52.125
It's great!
You've done a great job.

44:53.167 --> 44:57.130
If you're going to work here,
maybe you could, I don't know...

44:58.256 --> 44:58.965
...work.

44:59.215 --> 45:00.925
I am. I'm testing
the merchandise.

45:03.094 --> 45:07.391
You know where you can reach me.
I'll be back, if anyone cares.

45:13.981 --> 45:15.566
Did I do something wrong?

45:15.984 --> 45:17.068
Phone tree day.

45:17.444 --> 45:19.237
Phone tree day.

45:19.529 --> 45:21.907
Parents' hotline.
If there's an emergency...

45:22.199 --> 45:25.202
...like a snow day, they decide
who's the most responsible-

45:25.452 --> 45:27.120
You mean the most popular.

45:27.370 --> 45:28.873
- responsible mother
to sound the alarm.

45:29.123 --> 45:32.001
Each mom calls the next.
It's a big deal to get chosen.

45:32.251 --> 45:35.087
Sally never gets picked.
Everybody knows she's a-

45:36.839 --> 45:37.840
Different.

45:41.595 --> 45:43.263
Quiet! Quiet, quiet!

45:43.889 --> 45:46.517
Third name from the top
of the phone tree is...

45:48.894 --> 45:50.062
...Dori Kancher.

45:57.820 --> 45:59.739
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Can I help you?

46:02.575 --> 46:03.827
My sister.

46:04.119 --> 46:05.704
Just wanted to see my sister.

46:10.084 --> 46:12.336
Is that a snake tattoo?

46:12.878 --> 46:15.799
Yeah. There's one
on her boob too.

46:16.341 --> 46:17.384
That's right.

46:17.634 --> 46:19.052
I'm back.

46:19.636 --> 46:22.597
Hang onto your husbands, girls.

46:25.100 --> 46:28.020
All that's missing now is
me naked without my homework.

46:28.271 --> 46:31.607
Second from the top of the phone tree
will be Abigail Little.

46:31.858 --> 46:33.276
Is this for real?

46:34.443 --> 46:36.112
She screwed Coach Halfacre.

46:39.825 --> 46:42.119
- Don't do that.
- It wasn't me.

46:42.369 --> 46:44.788
- I certainly didn't do it.
- It was you.

46:46.582 --> 46:49.835
Finally, I'm so pleased
to report this.

46:50.085 --> 46:52.881
The top of the phone tree list is...

46:54.883 --> 46:56.092
One moment.

47:01.472 --> 47:02.515
It's Sally Owens.

47:07.813 --> 47:09.482
Go, Sal!

47:09.899 --> 47:11.567
Now that was me.

47:25.123 --> 47:26.374
Eye of newt...

47:26.626 --> 47:28.377
...toe of frog...

47:28.628 --> 47:30.630
...wool of bat, tongue of dog...

47:30.922 --> 47:33.216
Adder's fork and blindworm's sting.

47:33.466 --> 47:35.760
Barbados lime is just the thing.

47:36.886 --> 47:39.348
Cragged salt like a sailor's stubble!

47:40.641 --> 47:41.767
Flip the switch...

47:42.017 --> 47:44.269
...and let the cauldron bubble.

47:46.772 --> 47:48.607
How convivial!

47:52.904 --> 47:54.322
Wakey-wakey!

48:01.663 --> 48:03.666
Midnight margaritas!

48:04.500 --> 48:05.709
Come on!

49:19.206 --> 49:21.083
No, this is serious.

49:21.333 --> 49:22.417
All right.

49:23.043 --> 49:24.669
I see a man...

49:24.920 --> 49:27.799
I see a man in
your future and he is...

49:28.091 --> 49:29.842
He is gorgeous.

49:34.514 --> 49:35.431
He is big.

49:38.727 --> 49:40.187
But you're scared to death...

49:40.437 --> 49:43.524
...and you wind up
like a frigid old hag...

49:43.774 --> 49:46.902
...with your two frigid
old hag aunts.

49:51.991 --> 49:54.077
I don't know where that came from.
That was weird.

49:54.327 --> 49:56.287
She's never been interested
in her gifts.

49:57.330 --> 49:59.290
- She just made that all up.
- Don't lie.

49:59.541 --> 50:01.000
Gillian has her own magic.

50:01.252 --> 50:03.379
And we all know what it is.

50:06.257 --> 50:07.049
Oh, please!

50:07.299 --> 50:09.802
Since when is being a slut
a crime in this family?

50:13.974 --> 50:15.892
What would you know about it?

50:16.143 --> 50:18.562
When we put that spell on you
for Michael...

50:18.812 --> 50:20.897
...we had to bind it with molasses...

50:21.148 --> 50:23.066
...just to get your legs to open up.

50:25.153 --> 50:26.404
That's so wrong.

50:29.657 --> 50:32.076
You self-centered shrew!

50:32.285 --> 50:33.119
Ingrate!

50:33.369 --> 50:34.203
Goody two-shoes!

50:34.454 --> 50:35.455
Witch!

50:54.726 --> 50:57.353
Quite as often as I should have

50:59.481 --> 51:02.526
Could have said and done

51:02.943 --> 51:05.488
I just never found the time

51:08.574 --> 51:10.451
You were always...

51:10.701 --> 51:12.496
...on my mind

51:17.542 --> 51:19.503
Where did this bottle come from?

51:21.296 --> 51:22.756
Where did this bottle come from?

51:23.048 --> 51:25.635
Someone left it on the porch

51:38.982 --> 51:40.943
What's going on here?

51:41.568 --> 51:43.112
What's going on with you?

51:43.362 --> 51:45.155
What's going on in this house?

51:46.031 --> 51:47.908
Something's going on.
I can smell it.

51:48.159 --> 51:51.538
It's a very distinct smell.
It's the smell of bullshit.

51:52.247 --> 51:54.207
I don't know what
you're talking about.

51:56.876 --> 51:58.253
Broom fell.

51:58.503 --> 51:59.546
Company's coming.

52:04.218 --> 52:05.761
We had a problem.
We handled it.

52:06.053 --> 52:07.763
We deserve an explanation.

52:13.812 --> 52:14.896
Right.

52:15.564 --> 52:16.940
Come on, Jet, let's go.

52:22.529 --> 52:23.739
No.

52:25.908 --> 52:28.411
It's just not possible.
Don't even think it.

52:28.745 --> 52:30.955
Then tell me how that got here.

52:31.164 --> 52:32.707
How did this bottle get here?

52:32.957 --> 52:35.043
It's not possible.

52:48.850 --> 52:50.643
Leaving like this
is a harsh lesson.

52:50.894 --> 52:52.687
A lesson they must learn
on their own.

52:52.937 --> 52:54.481
What about the little ones?

52:54.773 --> 52:56.149
Not to worry, Jetty.

52:56.399 --> 52:59.945
A good piece of Maria's hanging rope
will protect them.

53:00.363 --> 53:02.865
You must promise us
you won't take them off.

53:03.115 --> 53:06.744
- Not until we come home.
- We'll only be gone a short while.

53:07.203 --> 53:08.746
Do you hear us?

53:09.163 --> 53:10.456
Promise?

53:13.251 --> 53:15.003
- Love you.
- Love you too.

53:24.222 --> 53:26.975
Make her stop.
I'll pay whatever it takes.

53:27.266 --> 53:29.060
Honey, can I see that a second?

53:29.310 --> 53:30.520
Thanks.

53:31.771 --> 53:33.523
What's that thing
around your neck?

53:33.773 --> 53:36.777
- The aunts gave it to us.
- They said it'd protect us.

53:37.611 --> 53:42.282
Kylie, please get that mint from
the garden before your bus comes.

53:42.783 --> 53:44.868
Where is the aspirin?

53:48.206 --> 53:50.750
- Please do as I say.
- Not while he's out there.

53:53.962 --> 53:55.839
Not while who's out where?

53:56.089 --> 53:57.382
The man under the roses.

53:57.924 --> 53:58.968
What?

54:03.597 --> 54:06.058
I don't see him.
Are you looking at him now?

54:06.309 --> 54:07.560
He's right there.

54:07.810 --> 54:08.769
Where?

54:10.521 --> 54:11.607
By the roses.

54:12.858 --> 54:14.568
They grew overnight.

54:15.652 --> 54:16.820
Oh, shit!

54:19.031 --> 54:21.033
Okay, sweetie, we'll get rid of it.

54:21.283 --> 54:23.161
You better call the aunts now.

54:23.411 --> 54:24.287
They left.

54:24.537 --> 54:26.497
What do you mean?
When did they leave?

54:26.748 --> 54:28.583
They said to give you a message:

54:29.375 --> 54:30.793
"Clean up your own mess. "

54:37.301 --> 54:38.594
Oh, God!

54:41.680 --> 54:44.808
You stop this, Jimmy!
You stop it!

54:45.059 --> 54:46.477
He's making them grow.

54:46.728 --> 54:49.606
He's trying to get to us
by making them grow!

54:49.856 --> 54:51.274
You leave us alone!

54:51.566 --> 54:53.944
Stop it, Gillian!
Stop it!

54:54.277 --> 54:55.654
Stop it!

54:57.948 --> 54:58.950
What?

54:59.241 --> 55:00.368
His boots!

55:03.537 --> 55:04.914
Oh, my God!

55:07.375 --> 55:08.376
Is he rising?

55:13.548 --> 55:16.343
Or is the ground sinking?

55:20.806 --> 55:23.726
What is he doing to us?
He's trying to get-

55:23.977 --> 55:26.604
Go inside.
Take care of the kids.

55:51.464 --> 55:53.174
It's early for roses, isn't it?

55:53.883 --> 55:55.802
Can I help you with something?

55:56.052 --> 55:58.639
I sure hope so.
Name's Gary Hallet.

55:58.890 --> 56:01.767
Special investigator,
prosecutor's office in Tucson.

56:08.900 --> 56:12.237
You sure are a long way
from home, Officer.

56:12.738 --> 56:13.739
Yes, ma'am.

56:14.698 --> 56:18.243
I was kind of hoping to talk
to your sister, Gillian.

56:18.493 --> 56:19.578
If she's around.

56:20.037 --> 56:23.291
She might have some information
on a case I'm working on.

56:23.541 --> 56:24.959
All right, I'll get her.

56:31.591 --> 56:33.928
How did you know
that I was her sister?

56:36.805 --> 56:39.016
Lucky guess, I guess.

56:42.102 --> 56:44.230
Why don't you come inside?

56:48.735 --> 56:51.029
A cop looking for Jimmy
wants to talk to you.

56:51.279 --> 56:53.365
And I think I'm having
a heart attack.

56:53.823 --> 56:54.908
Just calm down.

56:55.158 --> 56:56.785
Calm down.

56:58.412 --> 57:02.124
What is the question? The question is:
"How much can he know?"

57:02.375 --> 57:06.546
He seems to know a lot because
he's come all the way from Arizona.

57:07.046 --> 57:09.758
And I know this sounds
really strange...

57:09.967 --> 57:12.052
...but I don't think
I can lie to him.

57:12.302 --> 57:14.054
Of course you can lie to him.

57:14.388 --> 57:15.347
Breathe, breathe.

57:15.597 --> 57:17.641
Here's the story, right?
Here's the story.

57:19.017 --> 57:20.060
I left him...

57:20.435 --> 57:22.230
...because he hit me.

57:22.730 --> 57:25.191
And we haven't seen him since.
It's as simple as that.

57:25.608 --> 57:27.277
You just let me handle the rest.

57:27.527 --> 57:29.237
- Okay, good.
- All right?

57:29.946 --> 57:32.740
Left him because he hit you
and haven't seen him- What?

57:32.991 --> 57:34.535
Is he cute?

57:35.077 --> 57:36.620
Yeah. He's nice.

57:37.621 --> 57:38.706
In a very...

57:38.956 --> 57:41.083
...penal code sort of way.

57:41.333 --> 57:43.419
I left him because she hit him...

57:56.808 --> 57:58.102
Just herbs.

57:59.145 --> 58:00.396
From the garden.

58:04.859 --> 58:07.820
So what brings you to the island?

58:10.574 --> 58:11.366
This.

58:17.372 --> 58:18.999
You read my letter?

58:19.249 --> 58:20.584
Yes, ma'am, I did.

58:20.835 --> 58:23.087
It was a very personal letter.

58:23.630 --> 58:25.340
Yes, ma'am, it was.

58:28.301 --> 58:29.260
What?

58:29.511 --> 58:30.637
I'm sorry.

58:31.763 --> 58:33.557
- You seem familiar.
- Hello, there.

58:35.976 --> 58:37.436
Morning, Miss-

58:38.312 --> 58:39.480
Good morning, Miss Owens.

58:39.855 --> 58:40.940
Good morning...

58:41.190 --> 58:42.274
...Mr...?

58:42.525 --> 58:43.484
Mr. Hallet.

58:44.569 --> 58:46.696
I'm not going to
beat around the bush.

58:46.947 --> 58:50.408
I need to find your boyfriend,
James Angelov.

58:51.201 --> 58:53.078
I don't know where he is.

58:53.370 --> 58:56.874
I wouldn't exactly call him
my boyfriend.

58:57.667 --> 59:00.127
He's more like a big mistake.

59:02.004 --> 59:04.132
Is that his handiwork there?

59:04.507 --> 59:07.343
If a man hits me,
he only does it once.

59:09.638 --> 59:12.307
Can I take a peek at your...?

59:15.561 --> 59:17.229
Now, I can tell...

59:17.855 --> 59:20.942
...that you've never touched a woman
in anger all your life.

59:21.192 --> 59:23.069
May I have my hand back, please?

59:23.319 --> 59:26.072
You're telling me
you have no idea where he is?

59:26.322 --> 59:27.157
I told you.

59:27.532 --> 59:30.702
He hit me
and I haven't seen him since.

59:30.952 --> 59:31.786
When was that?

59:32.246 --> 59:33.330
Three days ago.

59:33.581 --> 59:35.791
Right, Sal? Three days.

59:36.083 --> 59:37.334
Excuse me.

59:39.420 --> 59:41.380
Whose car is that
in the driveway?

59:41.589 --> 59:43.632
The one with
the Arizona plates?

59:43.925 --> 59:45.135
That's my car.

59:45.427 --> 59:46.428
That's your car.

59:47.596 --> 59:49.389
Plate number 2-2-9 M-O-B?

59:50.724 --> 59:53.185
That's James L. Angelov's car.

59:53.560 --> 59:54.644
Come on now.

59:57.565 --> 59:59.942
We stole it, and it's a crime.

01:00:00.234 --> 01:00:03.905
I know this,
but he basically kidnapped her.

01:00:05.364 --> 01:00:06.532
He kidnapped you?

01:00:08.202 --> 01:00:11.288
He didn't really kidnap her.
He sort of, like...

01:00:11.538 --> 01:00:12.664
...a little nap.

01:00:12.998 --> 01:00:15.292
No, there was a car and she-

01:00:19.087 --> 01:00:20.799
What happened was, that she-

01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:24.177
You should know,
she has the worst taste in men.

01:00:25.303 --> 01:00:26.387
Well, you do.

01:00:26.638 --> 01:00:29.808
So I picked her up and I drove her
right back here.

01:00:30.058 --> 01:00:31.769
And we would be...

01:00:32.353 --> 01:00:36.232
...so happy to give him back his car,
because it is a crime-

01:00:36.524 --> 01:00:37.900
As you say...

01:00:38.984 --> 01:00:41.654
...you just don't know where he is...

01:00:42.154 --> 01:00:43.740
...to give him back that car.

01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:46.368
So basically,
nobody knows where he is.

01:00:46.618 --> 01:00:47.619
I'm sorry, what?

01:00:48.495 --> 01:00:50.622
You don't have any idea
where he is?

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.379
Would you mind if I just
took a look around?

01:00:57.630 --> 01:00:58.756
Good.

01:01:00.967 --> 01:01:03.636
What is wrong with you?

01:01:04.303 --> 01:01:05.930
I don't know!

01:01:06.305 --> 01:01:09.226
This young lady's name
was Phoebe Stone.

01:01:10.185 --> 01:01:12.229
Two years ago,
she was found strangled...

01:01:13.021 --> 01:01:14.815
...Iying on the side of the highway.

01:01:15.065 --> 01:01:17.109
Her body had been marked...

01:01:17.401 --> 01:01:18.610
...with a kind of brand...

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.865
...burned right into the face.

01:01:22.907 --> 01:01:24.993
Any help you ladies can give me...

01:01:25.243 --> 01:01:27.746
...in locating this
ex-friend of yours...

01:01:27.996 --> 01:01:29.956
...would sure be appreciated.

01:01:47.517 --> 01:01:49.144
She's all yours.

01:01:54.191 --> 01:01:55.651
Go arrest her!

01:01:55.902 --> 01:01:59.655
Their niece owns a shop where
they cook up a special placenta.

01:01:59.906 --> 01:02:04.285
And that's why the aunts don't age.
I tell you, they just don't age.

01:02:04.535 --> 01:02:07.956
- She's selling placentas?
- A placenta bar.

01:02:08.207 --> 01:02:10.834
On Halloween, they all
jump off the roof and fly!

01:02:11.085 --> 01:02:13.629
When they get mad at you,
they hex you.

01:02:13.879 --> 01:02:17.966
I wouldn't be surprised if he
turned up in a ditch somewhere.

01:02:18.593 --> 01:02:19.803
Sara, that is not true.

01:02:20.387 --> 01:02:23.723
- She's not saying they murdered him.
- Yes, I am.

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:27.102
Just that maybe they shook
his hand and then he died.

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.853
It's very mysterious.

01:02:29.062 --> 01:02:31.982
If any man dared take on
an Owens woman...

01:02:32.233 --> 01:02:35.653
...he'd live briefly in
the euphoria of her love...

01:02:35.903 --> 01:02:37.863
...until meeting an untimely death.

01:02:39.532 --> 01:02:40.783
The curse.

01:02:41.617 --> 01:02:42.661
Witch? Yeah.

01:02:42.911 --> 01:02:43.954
Evil? No.

01:02:44.204 --> 01:02:47.249
You get your psychos now and then,
animal slaughter...

01:02:47.666 --> 01:02:50.794
...ritual human disembowelment,
but that's really pretty rare.

01:02:51.044 --> 01:02:52.796
See, it's a pagan label.

01:02:53.046 --> 01:02:54.215
It's Sally.

01:02:57.218 --> 01:02:59.137
She's definitely not
into that stuff.

01:03:00.138 --> 01:03:01.514
She's not?

01:03:02.014 --> 01:03:02.849
Miss Owens...

01:03:03.182 --> 01:03:05.059
...I have a bone to pick with you.

01:03:05.309 --> 01:03:07.062
What can I do for you, Dwight?

01:03:07.312 --> 01:03:09.314
I could've gone
to a qualified doctor...

01:03:09.565 --> 01:03:12.359
...to attend to this
scalp condition of mine.

01:03:12.651 --> 01:03:15.195
Now, the more I use,
the less it works.

01:03:15.529 --> 01:03:16.905
The product doesn't work.

01:03:17.156 --> 01:03:19.868
That's because it doesn't
go on your head.

01:03:20.201 --> 01:03:21.578
If I don't put it on my head...

01:03:21.828 --> 01:03:24.039
...where the hell else would it go?

01:03:25.123 --> 01:03:27.292
Try to remember.

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.634
My mistake.

01:03:40.639 --> 01:03:42.017
There you go.

01:03:42.559 --> 01:03:44.186
Strange town.

01:03:44.436 --> 01:03:47.522
Never spent this much
on shampoo before...

01:03:48.065 --> 01:03:49.733
...in my life.

01:03:55.406 --> 01:03:58.034
Am I under some kind of surveillance?

01:03:58.951 --> 01:03:59.911
Should you be?

01:04:00.161 --> 01:04:01.913
If you want to know
something, ask me.

01:04:03.122 --> 01:04:04.374
I already did.

01:04:04.624 --> 01:04:08.045
And there appears to be something
missing from your story.

01:04:11.674 --> 01:04:15.386
I want to talk to you more,
but I got to finish some homework.

01:04:15.636 --> 01:04:18.682
How's about I come by your house
tomorrow morning?

01:04:19.182 --> 01:04:20.266
Fine.

01:04:20.975 --> 01:04:22.102
10 a. m.?

01:04:22.727 --> 01:04:23.728
Fine.

01:04:25.146 --> 01:04:26.481
That's a date.

01:05:08.736 --> 01:05:10.404
Jimmy, is that you?

01:05:17.662 --> 01:05:19.039
Go away.

01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:22.542
Go away.

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:34.972
To banish unwanted persons,
it says you need blessing seeds.

01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:36.682
All right. Good.

01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:41.063
- What about nigellus seeds?
- It's the same thing.

01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:43.106
Wow, is it?

01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:45.192
Good. You're good at this.

01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:48.362
Why can't we tell Mommy
we're sending the policeman away?

01:05:48.612 --> 01:05:51.740
Your mommy likes to pretend
she doesn't do magic.

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:55.370
And we must banish this man
for your mommy's own good.

01:05:56.204 --> 01:05:58.831
Blessing seeds. Right.
What else do we need?

01:05:59.082 --> 01:06:02.085
I told you to listen out the door
for Mr. Hallet.

01:06:03.044 --> 01:06:04.045
Blessing seeds...

01:06:06.757 --> 01:06:09.343
Oh, yeah, milk thistle.
I can't find anything here.

01:06:09.593 --> 01:06:11.053
Was this Mommy's?

01:06:13.555 --> 01:06:15.557
Yeah. Where did you get that?

01:06:16.225 --> 01:06:18.395
"He can flip pancakes in the air.

01:06:18.645 --> 01:06:21.564
He'll have one green eye, one blue.

01:06:21.815 --> 01:06:24.025
Hear my call a mile away. "

01:06:24.567 --> 01:06:26.236
Was it about Daddy?

01:06:29.573 --> 01:06:31.117
Yeah.

01:06:32.034 --> 01:06:33.744
But Daddy had brown eyes.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.542
You know...

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:42.796
...the truth is, this wasn't
about your daddy.

01:06:43.088 --> 01:06:46.216
This was when your mommy
was little...

01:06:46.717 --> 01:06:49.720
...and she was trying to invent
a guy who didn't exist...

01:06:50.012 --> 01:06:51.888
...to protect herself.

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:53.433
It's crazy.

01:06:53.766 --> 01:06:55.059
But...

01:06:56.894 --> 01:06:58.396
She loved your daddy.

01:06:58.646 --> 01:07:01.566
She loved him very, very much.

01:07:01.816 --> 01:07:04.278
I can't wait to fall in love.

01:07:11.452 --> 01:07:13.245
Kylie, listen to me.

01:07:16.416 --> 01:07:20.086
Do you ever put your arms out
and spin really fast?

01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:22.631
- She does it all the time.
- She does?

01:07:23.465 --> 01:07:24.925
That's what love is like.

01:07:26.343 --> 01:07:27.803
It makes your heart race.

01:07:28.095 --> 01:07:30.598
It turns the world upside-down.

01:07:31.599 --> 01:07:33.976
But if you're not careful...

01:07:34.268 --> 01:07:37.688
...if you don't keep your eyes
on something still...

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.318
...you can lose your balance.

01:07:41.568 --> 01:07:44.988
You can't see what's happening
to the people around you.

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:52.330
You can't see that you're
about to fall.

01:07:53.373 --> 01:07:55.500
Don't be sad, Aunt Gillian.

01:07:57.544 --> 01:07:59.504
I won't let you fall down.

01:08:00.004 --> 01:08:01.172
He's here! He's here!

01:08:01.923 --> 01:08:04.468
Make sure you tell him
about breakfast. Go!

01:08:07.513 --> 01:08:10.349
You came for breakfast.
We're having pancakes.

01:08:10.975 --> 01:08:12.977
I just came to talk to your mom.

01:08:13.227 --> 01:08:15.020
Great!
She's having pancakes too.

01:08:17.649 --> 01:08:19.109
Do you have a gun?

01:08:19.442 --> 01:08:20.694
Can I see it?

01:08:24.573 --> 01:08:26.366
He's here for breakfast.

01:08:28.035 --> 01:08:29.828
I have a question or two.

01:08:30.203 --> 01:08:33.457
- He's going to stay!
- Oh, good! Good work.

01:08:33.875 --> 01:08:37.795
Now go back out there
and keep them away from here.

01:08:40.799 --> 01:08:41.758
Belladonna.

01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:46.179
A sedative. People put it in
their tea to relax, calm their nerves.

01:08:46.721 --> 01:08:49.474
Some people also use it as a poison.

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:51.394
Which people?

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:54.522
Witch people.

01:08:54.772 --> 01:08:56.191
Witches.

01:08:57.192 --> 01:08:59.359
I guess you found me out, huh?

01:09:00.778 --> 01:09:01.529
I did.

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:03.782
You should come here on Halloween.

01:09:04.033 --> 01:09:05.451
You'd really see something.

01:09:05.701 --> 01:09:06.577
Yeah?

01:09:06.827 --> 01:09:09.246
We all jump off the roof and fly.

01:09:09.496 --> 01:09:11.332
We kill our husbands too.

01:09:12.207 --> 01:09:14.794
Or is that outside
your jurisdiction?

01:09:15.754 --> 01:09:19.674
Do you have any idea how strange
this all sounds to me?

01:09:20.008 --> 01:09:23.845
I got people telling me you're
here cooking up placenta bars...

01:09:24.095 --> 01:09:25.846
...you're into devil worship-

01:09:26.096 --> 01:09:28.850
No, there's no devil in the craft.

01:09:29.268 --> 01:09:31.437
So what kind of...

01:09:31.687 --> 01:09:33.523
...craft do you do?

01:09:33.773 --> 01:09:35.066
Do I do?

01:09:35.691 --> 01:09:38.236
I manufacture bath oils.

01:09:39.071 --> 01:09:40.906
And soaps and hand lotions...

01:09:41.156 --> 01:09:42.908
...and shampoo.

01:09:43.367 --> 01:09:45.118
And the aunts...

01:09:45.368 --> 01:09:48.162
...they like to meddle
in people's love lives.

01:09:51.584 --> 01:09:53.211
Magic isn't just...

01:09:53.461 --> 01:09:55.463
...spells and potions.

01:09:59.551 --> 01:10:00.927
Your badge?

01:10:09.937 --> 01:10:11.605
It's just a star.

01:10:12.565 --> 01:10:13.858
Just another symbol.

01:10:14.108 --> 01:10:15.610
Your talisman.

01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:19.197
It can't stop criminals
in their tracks...

01:10:19.447 --> 01:10:20.490
...can it?

01:10:22.159 --> 01:10:24.911
It has power because
you believe it does.

01:10:34.922 --> 01:10:36.465
Wish you could believe in me.

01:10:40.095 --> 01:10:41.513
Miss Owens...

01:10:43.515 --> 01:10:45.642
...are you hiding James Angelov?

01:10:45.976 --> 01:10:47.478
Not in this house.

01:10:50.106 --> 01:10:53.860
Did you or your sister
kill James Angelov?

01:10:54.694 --> 01:10:56.946
Oh, yeah.
Couple of times.

01:10:59.365 --> 01:11:01.409
Antonia, could you make
more of a mess?

01:11:01.659 --> 01:11:03.996
- Mom, I'm cooking.
- I can see that.

01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:05.414
Hey, there.

01:11:05.664 --> 01:11:08.125
Did you ever see a saguaro cactus?

01:11:09.668 --> 01:11:11.295
Step aside, you.

01:11:12.963 --> 01:11:14.007
You're about to.

01:11:36.322 --> 01:11:38.617
One stack of flapjacks...

01:11:38.867 --> 01:11:40.035
...and...

01:11:40.327 --> 01:11:42.996
...goodbye, Mr. Hallet.

01:11:43.497 --> 01:11:45.916
He knows how to flip pancakes.

01:11:48.919 --> 01:11:50.547
I assume you don't want pancakes.

01:11:50.797 --> 01:11:52.841
No, we want them!
We want them!

01:11:53.091 --> 01:11:55.593
Be careful. They tend to use
those as Frisbees.

01:11:57.804 --> 01:11:59.973
Can you ride a pony backwards?

01:12:01.057 --> 01:12:03.686
Backwards, forwards, sideways,
you name it.

01:12:04.145 --> 01:12:06.230
Okay, first troll.

01:12:06.564 --> 01:12:07.481
Look.

01:12:07.857 --> 01:12:09.233
A star!

01:12:10.317 --> 01:12:12.111
- This is not yours.
- That's all right.

01:12:12.987 --> 01:12:14.114
Second troll.

01:12:15.407 --> 01:12:19.202
And if you're anything like my girls...
here. It'll keep you clean.

01:12:19.453 --> 01:12:21.830
Isn't this cozy?

01:12:22.998 --> 01:12:24.541
Hi, Gary.

01:12:24.791 --> 01:12:26.544
I can call you Gary, can't I?

01:12:26.794 --> 01:12:27.628
Why not?

01:12:27.879 --> 01:12:28.671
Coffee?

01:12:28.921 --> 01:12:31.215
You must try my syrup.

01:12:31.549 --> 01:12:33.092
Here's the syrup.

01:12:33.968 --> 01:12:34.844
No! No!

01:12:52.447 --> 01:12:53.698
Ready?

01:12:53.948 --> 01:12:54.949
Go!

01:12:56.451 --> 01:12:57.410
Okay, yes!

01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:58.578
Let's go.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.915
I guess they didn't want
to eat that.

01:13:01.165 --> 01:13:02.958
I guess not.

01:13:30.446 --> 01:13:32.323
I've been looking for this.

01:13:34.951 --> 01:13:36.495
This is his party trick.

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:39.123
It's your ring, is it?

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:40.290
Could I have it?

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:42.376
What do you think
you're playing at?

01:13:42.626 --> 01:13:43.836
What do you mean?

01:13:47.798 --> 01:13:50.385
You better get yourselves
a damn good lawyer.

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:53.221
And don't even think
about leaving town.

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:57.058
What was in that syrup?

01:14:00.563 --> 01:14:03.899
We just stick to our stories.
No body, no crime.

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:07.027
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:14:07.987 --> 01:14:09.447
I'm feeling like shit.

01:14:09.739 --> 01:14:10.948
I'm not sleeping.

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.325
I. Me. Mine.

01:14:12.617 --> 01:14:14.327
That's all you can think about.

01:14:14.578 --> 01:14:15.495
You.

01:14:15.746 --> 01:14:17.164
It's all about you.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.627
- I don't want to fight.
- Don't walk away from me.

01:14:24.172 --> 01:14:26.841
I'm sick and tired
of cleaning up your messes.

01:14:28.843 --> 01:14:30.970
Yeah, you're right.
You're always right.

01:14:31.929 --> 01:14:33.639
I'm just a mess.

01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:36.185
Just one big mess!

01:14:38.062 --> 01:14:39.605
At least I've lived my life.

01:14:39.855 --> 01:14:42.941
You hate me for it because
it scares the hell out of you.

01:14:43.275 --> 01:14:45.486
Gillian, I don't hate you.

01:14:45.944 --> 01:14:49.616
You spend all your energy
trying to fit in, be normal!

01:14:49.866 --> 01:14:51.242
But you'll never fit in.

01:14:51.493 --> 01:14:54.079
Because we're different!
And so are your girls.

01:14:55.455 --> 01:14:57.290
You leave them out of this.

01:14:57.582 --> 01:15:00.586
All my life, I've wished
I had half your talent.

01:15:02.963 --> 01:15:04.757
You're wasting yourself!

01:15:05.049 --> 01:15:07.635
I want you out of here.
I want you gone.

01:15:09.261 --> 01:15:10.805
Okay, fine.

01:15:11.555 --> 01:15:12.933
I'm gone.

01:15:13.725 --> 01:15:14.643
Good.

01:15:16.853 --> 01:15:18.897
What? What are you doing?

01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:19.981
Where are you going?

01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:22.109
I'm doing the right thing.

01:15:23.402 --> 01:15:25.571
You're not telling him
what happened!

01:15:25.863 --> 01:15:29.033
Funny. The moment he walked in,
that's all I want to do.

01:15:29.325 --> 01:15:31.536
Will you get on your knees
and beg for mercy?

01:15:33.579 --> 01:15:36.083
You want me to be true to myself?

01:15:36.625 --> 01:15:38.085
Then watch this.

01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:59.734
It's the goddamn Twilight Zone.

01:16:05.323 --> 01:16:08.367
- It was Jimmy's ring.
- Oh, really.

01:16:08.617 --> 01:16:10.619
I know you knew that,
but I needed to tell you.

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:12.372
I was serious back there.

01:16:12.664 --> 01:16:15.292
Get yourself a lawyer
before you talk to me.

01:16:15.542 --> 01:16:17.169
I don't want a lawyer.

01:16:24.636 --> 01:16:25.803
All right.

01:16:31.017 --> 01:16:32.518
Come on in.

01:16:33.186 --> 01:16:35.105
Excuse the mess.

01:16:35.731 --> 01:16:37.900
Wasn't expecting company.

01:16:39.318 --> 01:16:41.320
Have yourself a seat.

01:16:43.364 --> 01:16:45.366
Let's see what I'll need here.

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:50.580
You don't need to look
at that stuff.

01:17:00.883 --> 01:17:03.219
How many times
did you read my letter?

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:05.388
A few.

01:17:06.764 --> 01:17:08.766
I have to study all the evidence.

01:17:10.769 --> 01:17:12.854
Okay, you want to sit down?

01:17:13.939 --> 01:17:16.191
This is the testimony of Sally Owens.

01:17:16.441 --> 01:17:18.443
March 8th, 1998.

01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:23.741
You going to sit down?

01:17:31.958 --> 01:17:33.710
Where is James Angelov?

01:17:34.294 --> 01:17:36.463
I think he's in the spirit world.

01:17:36.714 --> 01:17:39.675
- You think he's dead.
- No, I think he's haunting us.

01:17:44.597 --> 01:17:46.850
What evidence did you get
from reading my letter?

01:17:47.267 --> 01:17:48.935
Did you or your sister...

01:17:49.185 --> 01:17:50.937
...kill James Angelov?

01:17:52.897 --> 01:17:55.066
Gillian didn't kill anybody.

01:17:55.734 --> 01:17:57.569
Gillian didn't.

01:17:58.069 --> 01:18:00.156
Gillian didn't, but you did?

01:18:02.867 --> 01:18:04.035
Did you?

01:18:05.453 --> 01:18:06.954
Sally, did you?

01:18:10.959 --> 01:18:13.754
What if I told you I did?
What would you do?

01:18:15.422 --> 01:18:18.800
Would you send me to jail
for life all because...

01:18:19.051 --> 01:18:21.303
...the world was short a man
like Jimmy Angelov?

01:18:21.553 --> 01:18:24.682
It's not for you or me to decide
how he should be punished.

01:18:29.145 --> 01:18:30.605
He has to be held accountable.

01:18:30.855 --> 01:18:32.857
Well, he has been punished.

01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:37.154
He has?

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:49.417
You should get a lawyer's advice
before we go any further.

01:18:51.503 --> 01:18:52.754
Now listen.

01:18:53.088 --> 01:18:55.674
I know you're in
some kind of trouble.

01:18:55.924 --> 01:18:57.259
All right?

01:18:58.427 --> 01:19:00.179
If you will trust me...

01:19:00.429 --> 01:19:01.973
...tell me what you know...

01:19:03.015 --> 01:19:04.809
...I promise you...

01:19:05.476 --> 01:19:09.815
...I will do everything I can
to keep you from harm's way.

01:19:29.252 --> 01:19:30.879
I can't, I can't, I can't.

01:19:31.129 --> 01:19:33.047
I can't either, I'm sorry.

01:19:49.482 --> 01:19:51.610
One green eye, one blue.

01:19:55.864 --> 01:19:57.533
I can't, I can't.

01:19:57.783 --> 01:19:58.993
I've got to go.

01:20:02.872 --> 01:20:04.874
I was born with it.

01:20:09.087 --> 01:20:10.464
Mommy.

01:20:19.431 --> 01:20:20.975
I need you.

01:20:36.450 --> 01:20:37.660
What's going on?

01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:39.954
I didn't do anything.

01:20:40.204 --> 01:20:42.456
Go downstairs. It's okay.

01:21:09.570 --> 01:21:10.445
Officer Hallet.

01:21:12.489 --> 01:21:15.784
Just looking at you
makes me homesick.

01:22:02.168 --> 01:22:03.002
What's wrong?

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:06.672
Cat got your tongue?

01:22:54.975 --> 01:22:55.893
Someday...

01:22:56.144 --> 01:22:58.521
...you'll explain this all to me.

01:23:15.372 --> 01:23:16.999
What was that, Sally?

01:23:17.291 --> 01:23:19.251
That was him, wasn't it?

01:23:19.752 --> 01:23:21.129
Is he gone, or what?

01:23:21.379 --> 01:23:23.756
You killed his spirit,
but I took his life.

01:23:24.007 --> 01:23:27.552
I'll tell you all you need to know.
How I did it, where I buried him.

01:23:27.844 --> 01:23:31.014
I'll tell you what I did it with.
I'll tell you how I-

01:23:31.265 --> 01:23:34.018
Hold on just a goddamn second,
all right?

01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:35.936
One step at a time.

01:23:36.312 --> 01:23:38.355
I took an oath to uphold the law.

01:23:38.647 --> 01:23:40.858
I came here
to bring in the bad guy.

01:23:41.066 --> 01:23:43.653
Generally, that's what I do.

01:23:52.287 --> 01:23:55.082
You asked me how many times
I read your letter.

01:23:56.125 --> 01:23:58.795
I must've read it about
1000 times.

01:24:00.463 --> 01:24:04.634
It was your letter that
brought me here. It was you.

01:24:06.677 --> 01:24:09.556
And I'm all mixed-up about that.

01:24:17.773 --> 01:24:20.652
The reason you're here
and you don't know why...

01:24:20.902 --> 01:24:22.904
...is because I sent for you.

01:24:26.324 --> 01:24:28.326
When I was a little girl...

01:24:30.913 --> 01:24:32.790
...I worked a spell...

01:24:34.458 --> 01:24:36.627
...so I would never fall in love.

01:24:38.587 --> 01:24:43.009
I asked for qualities in a man
that I knew couldn't possibly exist.

01:24:44.678 --> 01:24:46.471
One green eye, one...

01:24:46.763 --> 01:24:47.848
...blue?

01:24:51.309 --> 01:24:53.019
But you do.

01:24:55.732 --> 01:24:58.401
You're saying
what I'm feeling is just...

01:24:58.776 --> 01:25:00.027
...one of your spells?

01:25:00.945 --> 01:25:02.947
Yeah. It's not real.

01:25:04.657 --> 01:25:09.079
If you stay, I wouldn't know
if it was because of the spell...

01:25:10.122 --> 01:25:13.667
...and you wouldn't know if it was
because I didn't want to go to prison.

01:25:20.341 --> 01:25:22.677
You know, all relationships
have problems.

01:25:29.976 --> 01:25:31.604
I'm right, aren't I?

01:25:34.190 --> 01:25:35.900
You don't know, do you?

01:25:44.659 --> 01:25:47.162
Why don't you do what you do...

01:25:47.412 --> 01:25:49.456
...and I do what I do...

01:25:51.541 --> 01:25:53.794
...and we'll see where we end up.

01:26:03.721 --> 01:26:06.934
Curses only have power
when you believe in them.

01:26:08.268 --> 01:26:09.978
And I don't.

01:26:14.525 --> 01:26:15.859
You know what?

01:26:19.364 --> 01:26:21.366
I wished for you too.

01:27:15.924 --> 01:27:20.138
I'm feeling very
into sisters right now.

01:27:33.611 --> 01:27:34.945
Come on.

01:27:35.655 --> 01:27:36.489
Oh, dear.

01:27:36.989 --> 01:27:39.200
It seems we've not arrived
in the nick of time.

01:27:41.286 --> 01:27:44.122
I see our instincts are getting
a little rusty.

01:27:44.373 --> 01:27:46.375
He's squatting inside her
like a toad.

01:27:46.625 --> 01:27:48.794
This is what comes from dabbling.

01:27:49.044 --> 01:27:51.838
You can't practice witchcraft
while you look down your nose at it.

01:27:52.089 --> 01:27:52.840
I know.

01:27:53.091 --> 01:27:54.592
I know.

01:27:55.385 --> 01:27:57.387
Just tell me what to do
and I'll do it.

01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:01.140
- We must banish him.
- Force his spirit back to the grave.

01:28:01.391 --> 01:28:03.685
- We need a full coven.
- Nine women.

01:28:04.018 --> 01:28:05.521
Twelve's better.

01:28:06.605 --> 01:28:08.232
Do you have any friends?

01:28:09.483 --> 01:28:10.317
Linda!

01:28:10.567 --> 01:28:11.652
It's Sally.

01:28:11.902 --> 01:28:13.570
I'm activating the phone tree.

01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:16.658
You know the stuff everyone
whispers about me...

01:28:16.908 --> 01:28:18.493
...the hexes, the spells?

01:28:18.743 --> 01:28:20.078
Well, here's the thing.

01:28:20.704 --> 01:28:21.579
I'm a witch!

01:28:22.247 --> 01:28:23.915
I got the best news.

01:28:24.165 --> 01:28:26.584
Sally just came out.

01:28:27.210 --> 01:28:29.630
What a fabulous affirmation.

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:32.883
Her sister just got out of
a bad relationship...

01:28:33.134 --> 01:28:35.511
...and now the guy
won't leave her alone.

01:29:01.706 --> 01:29:03.875
Oh, can you bring a broom?

01:29:34.450 --> 01:29:37.370
- I see headlights.
- Mom, they're here!

01:29:37.995 --> 01:29:39.957
Come on! They're here!

01:29:41.124 --> 01:29:42.918
It's in the kitchen!
In the side door!

01:29:44.294 --> 01:29:47.381
Come in!
It's so good of you to come.

01:29:48.465 --> 01:29:51.009
No, now's not the time to be shy.
Come on in.

01:29:51.301 --> 01:29:54.722
Grab yourselves a spoon.
You can stir right over there.

01:29:56.683 --> 01:30:01.145
You get right over here and grab
that spoon and dig right in.

01:30:01.437 --> 01:30:03.314
Doesn't that look great?

01:30:03.606 --> 01:30:06.277
And the fumes are great for the pores.

01:30:06.652 --> 01:30:10.531
Not to mention sealing his nasty
spirit back into the grave.

01:30:11.031 --> 01:30:13.617
Once, I was across town,
my daughter had a nightmare.

01:30:13.909 --> 01:30:16.663
I swear, I could hear her crying.

01:30:16.955 --> 01:30:18.915
There's a little witch in all of us.

01:30:19.666 --> 01:30:21.960
Everything's almost ready, Aunt Jet.

01:30:25.964 --> 01:30:27.508
I didn't expect you here.

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:32.096
Ever since I was a little girl,
I've wanted to see inside your house.

01:30:32.513 --> 01:30:34.140
Thank you for coming.

01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:35.308
Is this okay?

01:30:35.558 --> 01:30:37.184
It's all I had.

01:30:38.436 --> 01:30:40.147
Ladies, let's begin.

01:30:44.276 --> 01:30:46.820
All right, ladies, pick a broom.

01:30:47.112 --> 01:30:48.488
Form a circle.

01:30:48.697 --> 01:30:49.948
Holy shit!

01:30:54.829 --> 01:30:58.207
I've been strung out
by a guy before, but this...

01:31:07.009 --> 01:31:08.761
Each of you
pick up your brooms.

01:31:09.261 --> 01:31:10.804
Hold them at staff length...

01:31:12.097 --> 01:31:13.891
...handle to brush.

01:31:15.977 --> 01:31:18.104
Remember that as we go forth...

01:31:18.355 --> 01:31:20.523
...it is only with our hearts
beating as one...

01:31:20.815 --> 01:31:23.235
...that we can save the life
of this child.

01:31:40.546 --> 01:31:42.965
Are we supposed to say this?

01:32:28.723 --> 01:32:30.183
Stop it. Stop it!

01:32:30.516 --> 01:32:32.059
We're killing her!

01:32:39.484 --> 01:32:42.112
Fight this, you bitch!

01:32:50.205 --> 01:32:51.831
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:32:52.081 --> 01:32:53.958
Gilly! Gilly, honey!

01:32:55.710 --> 01:32:57.587
It's okay. I love you.

01:33:04.553 --> 01:33:06.222
Stay with me.

01:33:09.808 --> 01:33:11.227
Please.

01:33:13.229 --> 01:33:16.024
Please, just let him take me.

01:33:16.858 --> 01:33:18.527
No, you have to hold on.

01:33:18.777 --> 01:33:20.987
Gill, you have to stay with me.

01:33:22.739 --> 01:33:24.866
Gilly. No, stay with me.

01:33:25.116 --> 01:33:26.869
Gilly, stay with me.

01:33:27.745 --> 01:33:29.121
He wants...

01:33:29.372 --> 01:33:30.665
...me.

01:33:30.915 --> 01:33:32.458
Just me.

01:33:32.708 --> 01:33:33.918
No.

01:33:35.002 --> 01:33:37.547
Everyone will be safe.

01:33:38.632 --> 01:33:39.800
Just let him...

01:33:40.008 --> 01:33:41.260
...take me.

01:33:47.683 --> 01:33:50.186
Don't die on me, Gilly Owens, please.

01:33:50.436 --> 01:33:53.523
Because we're supposed
to die together, remember?

01:33:53.773 --> 01:33:54.732
The same time.

01:33:54.983 --> 01:33:57.986
You promised me that.
And this is not that day.

01:33:58.862 --> 01:34:00.864
I love you, Sally.

01:34:06.412 --> 01:34:07.288
Okay, wait.

01:34:07.538 --> 01:34:10.291
I've got it.
Get them back in the circle.

01:34:32.857 --> 01:34:36.110
Hey, Jimmy, I got a worm
with your name on it.

01:34:42.743 --> 01:34:44.119
You thirsty?

01:34:57.008 --> 01:34:58.635
Is this what you want?

01:34:59.093 --> 01:35:00.386
Well, this...

01:35:00.637 --> 01:35:02.181
...you can't have.

01:35:06.352 --> 01:35:07.645
My blood.

01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:09.188
Your blood.

01:35:09.438 --> 01:35:10.147
Our blood!

01:35:10.397 --> 01:35:11.482
Maria's blood. Now!

01:35:11.816 --> 01:35:13.151
Push her in.

01:35:29.710 --> 01:35:30.795
I love you, Gillian.

01:35:50.233 --> 01:35:51.192
We did it!

01:35:52.735 --> 01:35:54.529
Heads up, ladies.

01:35:55.363 --> 01:35:56.573
Ashes to ashes...

01:35:56.823 --> 01:35:58.366
...dust to dust.

01:36:03.164 --> 01:36:06.709
I wonder if that would work
on my ex-husband?

01:36:06.959 --> 01:36:08.252
Come on, ladies...

01:36:08.544 --> 01:36:10.671
...Let's clean house!

01:36:11.714 --> 01:36:13.383
Get him out of here!

01:36:13.717 --> 01:36:15.010
Come along, ladies.

01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:16.428
Through the kitchen!

01:36:17.846 --> 01:36:19.181
Follow me!

01:36:19.431 --> 01:36:20.891
Well done!

01:36:23.852 --> 01:36:26.022
Sweep him to the roses.

01:37:12.614 --> 01:37:14.616
There's something for you.

01:37:16.284 --> 01:37:17.744
From Arizona.

01:37:30.299 --> 01:37:33.428
"Dear Miss Owens:
Any further investigations...

01:37:34.053 --> 01:37:37.641
Office hereby concluded
James Angelov's cause of death was...

01:37:38.434 --> 01:37:39.810
...accidental.

01:37:41.103 --> 01:37:45.024
Jewelry in ashes of structure
provided positive identification.

01:37:45.315 --> 01:37:47.109
Sincerely, Gary Hallet...

01:37:47.359 --> 01:37:49.237
...Special Investigator. "

01:37:52.532 --> 01:37:54.576
I don't think he's in there.

01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:03.252
What would you do?

01:38:05.004 --> 01:38:06.714
What wouldn't I do...

01:38:07.006 --> 01:38:08.716
...for the right guy?

01:39:26.342 --> 01:39:29.929
Can love travel back in time
and heal a broken heart?

01:39:31.055 --> 01:39:34.434
Was it our joined hands that
finally lifted Maria's curse?

01:39:35.853 --> 01:39:38.022
I'd like to think so.

01:39:40.607 --> 01:39:43.360
There are some things
I know for certain:

01:39:43.944 --> 01:39:46.906
Always throw spilled salt
over your left shoulder.

01:39:47.741 --> 01:39:49.951
Keep rosemary by your garden gate.

01:39:50.201 --> 01:39:52.162
Plant lavender for luck.

01:39:52.412 --> 01:39:54.497
And fall in love whenever you can.
