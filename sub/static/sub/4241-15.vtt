WEBVTT

00:01.544 --> 00:04.078
The Celibacy Club will now
come to order.

00:04.130 --> 00:06.131
Let's start the meeting
by reading the minutes

00:06.216 --> 00:08.350
from last week's meeting
where we read the minutes

00:08.418 --> 00:10.185
from the previous meeting,

00:10.253 --> 00:12.771
and Rachel spent the hour
quizzing Quinn about the nature

00:12.856 --> 00:14.023
of her relationship with Finn.

00:14.090 --> 00:16.308
Questions somebody still
refuses to answer.

00:16.393 --> 00:18.160
And I will continue
to refuse to answer them

00:18.228 --> 00:19.428
because they are none
of your business.

00:19.479 --> 00:20.813
All I will reveal

00:20.897 --> 00:23.598
is that I rejoined the Celibacy
Club to focus on me.

00:23.650 --> 00:24.883
Me, too.
Finn is kryptonite, which is

00:24.951 --> 00:27.453
why I am focusing all my energies
now on my songwriting.

00:27.537 --> 00:30.439
Yes, and I have to say
I am very inspired

00:30.490 --> 00:33.626
that both of you are showing how
celibacy is a viable option

00:33.693 --> 00:35.411
for teens who simply aren't
ready for intimacy,

00:35.462 --> 00:36.945
and for those who are older

00:36.997 --> 00:38.664
and are terrified
of the hose monster.

00:38.732 --> 00:40.782
I have a little bit
of club swag here

00:40.834 --> 00:44.503
that I think's really
gonna catch on. Ready?

00:44.587 --> 00:45.804
Chastity charms.

00:45.889 --> 00:49.091
We hand out the little hearts,
but not the key.

00:49.142 --> 00:51.644
That way, nobody can open
the lock forever.

00:51.728 --> 00:54.763
And ladies,
that's what keeps us safe.

00:54.814 --> 00:56.715
I have some questions.

00:56.783 --> 00:58.467
Some things that I...
I'm curious about.

00:58.518 --> 01:00.135
No, no, no,
why be curious?

01:00.186 --> 01:02.738
No, wait to have relations until
you're comfortable, right?

01:02.805 --> 01:04.973
Maybe till your honeymoon,
I don't know.

01:05.025 --> 01:06.442
Maybe even later!

01:06.493 --> 01:08.460
Celibacy, ladies! Dig it!

01:11.765 --> 01:13.832
I'm just so disappointed.

01:13.917 --> 01:16.318
Why? I thought you wanted the
chastity charms to catch on.

01:16.369 --> 01:19.038
I did, until I realized they
were wearing the chastity charms

01:19.122 --> 01:20.205
as clip-on nipple rings.

01:20.290 --> 01:21.590
I know preaching
abstinence is hard,

01:21.657 --> 01:23.092
but I've seen
how a teen pregnancy

01:23.159 --> 01:24.593
can turn a kid's
world upside down.

01:24.660 --> 01:26.545
So keep fighting the good fight.

01:26.629 --> 01:29.548
And I'm happy to do whatever I
can to help make celibacy

01:29.632 --> 01:31.016
an option for these kids.

01:31.101 --> 01:32.601
I don't know, hot stuff.

01:32.668 --> 01:35.637
Sounds pretty lame...

01:35.689 --> 01:37.005
Holly!
What are you doing here?

01:37.057 --> 01:40.109
Subbing. The health and wellness
teacher's out

01:40.176 --> 01:43.395
with a mad case of the herp.
Yikers.

01:43.480 --> 01:45.514
- Oh, it's so good to see you!
- You, too!

01:45.565 --> 01:46.648
Oh, this face, this face!

01:48.151 --> 01:50.235
Oh. Oh, this is...

01:50.320 --> 01:51.320
Emma.

01:51.371 --> 01:52.854
- Emma, Emma Pillsbury.
- Oh, hi.

01:52.906 --> 01:54.073
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

01:54.157 --> 01:56.291
- This is Holly Holliday.
- Hi, Holly.

01:56.359 --> 01:57.543
Have a seat here.

01:57.627 --> 02:00.045
- Oh, thank you.
- Wow!

02:00.130 --> 02:03.332
So, I'm curious why
you don't, uh, think

02:03.383 --> 02:05.884
that celibacy is a valid choice
for teenagers.

02:05.969 --> 02:07.369
Oh, I do.
I think it's a valid choice.

02:07.420 --> 02:08.971
I just don't think it's
that realistic.

02:09.038 --> 02:10.756
You know, it's like saying

02:10.840 --> 02:13.142
vegetarianism is an option
for lions.

02:15.979 --> 02:18.931
I just read in the newspaper
that ninety high school girls in

02:19.015 --> 02:23.152
a Memphis school district got
pregnant within three months!

02:23.219 --> 02:24.770
I mean, it <i>is</i> Tennessee,
but still.

02:24.854 --> 02:27.106
We've got to shake things up,
you know?

02:27.190 --> 02:29.575
Information is power.
Oh, and by the way, Will,

02:29.659 --> 02:33.328
some of your Glee kids are
the most clueless.

02:33.396 --> 02:36.565
Demonstration: This is a condom,

02:36.616 --> 02:38.667
which can help prevent
the spread of HIV,

02:38.734 --> 02:40.068
which can lead to AIDS,

02:40.120 --> 02:42.087
and it also prevents pregnancy.

02:42.172 --> 02:43.789
Wait, cucumbers can give you
AIDS?

02:43.873 --> 02:46.425
Seriously? 'Cause I just had
them on my salad!

02:46.509 --> 02:49.878
- We've got to educate these kids.
- I strongly disagree.

02:49.929 --> 02:51.580
I don't think that we
should barrage these kids

02:51.648 --> 02:53.132
with graphic information.
They're kids.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.683
I don't want to steal
their innocence.

02:54.750 --> 02:58.687
Are you, like,
some kind of crazy Pope lady?

02:58.754 --> 03:01.723
Think about the images
that these kids are exposed to.

03:01.775 --> 03:04.393
I mean, think about
what they have access to.

03:04.444 --> 03:05.761
That doesn't make it okay.

03:05.829 --> 03:07.229
And it shouldn't
change the message

03:07.280 --> 03:09.314
that they get from us,
which is this is serious stuff

03:09.399 --> 03:10.449
and it's not for kids
and it's not for adults!

03:12.152 --> 03:15.270
Okay, well,
I think that's a little naive.

03:15.321 --> 03:19.208
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to have crazy sex,

03:19.275 --> 03:21.943
because I'm crazy
informed about it.

03:22.996 --> 03:24.129
Kidding.

03:26.382 --> 03:28.634
<i>- Hasta luego.
- Hasta luego.</i>

03:30.336 --> 03:32.621
Oh, man.

03:32.672 --> 03:36.124
Hey, Britt-britt.
So listen.

03:36.176 --> 03:39.144
How about you and I pop in some
<i>Sweet Valley High</i> this evening,

03:39.229 --> 03:40.629
get our cuddle on?

03:40.697 --> 03:43.232
Look, I'd really like to
get my sweet lady-kisses on,

03:43.299 --> 03:47.352
but I haven't been
feeling very sexy lately.

03:47.437 --> 03:49.304
I think I have a
bun in the oven.

03:49.355 --> 03:51.740
Please don't tell anyone.

03:51.807 --> 03:54.860
- Okay? Especially Artie.
- Yeah, sure.

03:54.944 --> 03:55.944
Your secret's safe with...

03:55.995 --> 03:57.746
Oh, my God. Brittany's pregnant.

03:57.813 --> 03:59.081
Oh, my God.
Brittany's pregnant.

03:59.148 --> 04:01.166
- It was only a matter of time.
- For what?

04:01.251 --> 04:02.367
Brittany to get pregnant.

04:02.452 --> 04:04.369
- Oh. Congratulations.
- For what?

04:04.454 --> 04:05.654
Oh, you didn't hear?
Your girlfriend's preggo.

04:05.705 --> 04:07.206
You're gonna be a baby daddy.

04:09.008 --> 04:10.125
All right, folks.

04:10.176 --> 04:11.493
Regionals is in a week.

04:11.544 --> 04:13.545
It's time to get deep
into our set list.

04:13.630 --> 04:15.464
Artie?

04:15.515 --> 04:17.298
You okay?

04:17.350 --> 04:19.017
My life is over.

04:19.101 --> 04:22.170
How am I supposed
to support a baby?

04:22.222 --> 04:24.339
How could you not
tell me about this?

04:24.390 --> 04:25.324
Wait, Brittany,
are you pregnant?

04:25.391 --> 04:27.593
Definitely.
I'm so sorry, Artie.

04:27.660 --> 04:30.279
I didn't want to upset you.

04:30.346 --> 04:32.481
I thought I could surprise you
when I dropped him off.

04:32.532 --> 04:34.683
I'm pretty sure it's a boy.

04:34.751 --> 04:36.835
Um...
Babies don't get dropped off.

04:36.903 --> 04:38.537
Wait, Brittany.
Have you been to a doctor yet?

04:38.621 --> 04:40.822
That's the only way to be sure.

04:40.874 --> 04:42.958
I don't need to go to a doctor.

04:43.025 --> 04:44.626
I just need
to look outside my window.

04:44.694 --> 04:46.528
Three days ago,

04:46.579 --> 04:48.764
a stork built its nest
on top of my garage.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.966
I'm not stupid.
It's obviously getting ready

04:51.033 --> 04:53.051
to bring me my baby.

04:53.136 --> 04:55.003
I know where babies come from.

04:57.173 --> 04:59.558
<i>And that's when I realized
you were right.</i>

04:59.642 --> 05:03.011
Let's go. Health and wellness
Jazzercise class!

05:03.062 --> 05:04.930
Do we feel our hearts
pumping yet, guys?

05:06.432 --> 05:09.050
You see? We have really got
to educate these kids.

05:09.102 --> 05:10.519
How are we going to do that
without being too graphic?

05:10.570 --> 05:11.770
Breathe it in.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.572
I want to educate them,
not titillate them.

05:13.656 --> 05:17.276
Didn't you ever read
Jessica Seinfeld's cookbook?

05:17.360 --> 05:20.895
It's all about taking vegetables
and hiding it in food

05:20.947 --> 05:23.282
so that you can trick kids into
eating what's good for them.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.666
Shake it!

05:24.734 --> 05:26.084
Ah! And loose.

05:26.169 --> 05:27.786
I'm not following.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.671
It's Jazzercise, Will.
It's really not that hard.

05:29.739 --> 05:31.039
- No.
- Grease it.

05:31.090 --> 05:32.174
I'm still talking
about the vegetable hiding.

05:32.241 --> 05:33.508
All I'm saying is

05:33.576 --> 05:36.261
all we have to do
is find a way to sneak in

05:36.346 --> 05:39.548
the sex education lesson
in a less provocative way.

05:39.599 --> 05:41.583
And stretch.

05:41.634 --> 05:43.936
Oh!

05:44.020 --> 05:45.887
- You guys were awesome.
- Yeah!

05:45.939 --> 05:47.189
How good do we feel?

05:47.256 --> 05:49.141
Are we sweating? Yes!

05:49.225 --> 05:50.475
Next week, we are going to talk

05:50.560 --> 05:52.427
about the power
of muscle testing.

05:52.478 --> 05:54.929
Yeah? Bye. Love you.

05:54.981 --> 05:56.148
Okay.

05:56.232 --> 05:57.866
Here's what I think
you should do.

05:57.933 --> 05:59.117
Let me come
into Glee Club this week

05:59.202 --> 06:00.652
and I'll show you what I mean.

06:00.737 --> 06:02.437
The kids will think that they're
getting ready for Regionals,

06:02.488 --> 06:04.990
but really I'll slip
in a little lesson

06:05.074 --> 06:07.108
about how to avoid STDs.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.162
And speaking of STDs,
how is your dating life?

06:10.246 --> 06:13.665
Um, right now, I'm the president
of the Celibacy Club.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.083
Mmm.

06:15.134 --> 06:16.785
That's a waste
of some fine man-butt.

06:21.090 --> 06:22.074
Sexy.

06:22.141 --> 06:23.759
I really hope that's not one

06:23.810 --> 06:25.110
of the requirements
for Regionals,

06:25.178 --> 06:26.428
because with Berry
in those tights,

06:26.479 --> 06:28.146
- we don't stand a chance.
- No, this isn't

06:28.231 --> 06:29.348
about Regionals.
I'm less worried

06:29.432 --> 06:30.565
about that right now
and more worried

06:30.633 --> 06:32.300
about the fact that
it's become clear to me

06:32.352 --> 06:34.469
that some of you
have been lacking

06:34.520 --> 06:37.138
when it comes
to understanding the...

06:37.190 --> 06:39.408
The, uh...

06:39.475 --> 06:43.445
The intricacies
of adult relationships.

06:43.496 --> 06:44.830
Yeah, anyways...

06:44.914 --> 06:47.082
Along with preparing for our
Regional next week,

06:47.149 --> 06:49.334
I want to spend the week
educating ourselves

06:49.419 --> 06:51.753
about some of these...
intricacies.

06:51.821 --> 06:54.156
Is this the appropriate forum
for that?

06:54.223 --> 06:55.990
Look, whenever we had, uh,

06:56.042 --> 06:57.793
issues in the past
that are on our minds

06:57.844 --> 06:59.127
or giving us problems,

06:59.178 --> 07:00.429
it's always helped us
to sing about it.

07:00.496 --> 07:04.549
So this week I have
invited a special guest.

07:04.634 --> 07:06.718
Miss Holiday.

07:07.837 --> 07:10.472
<i>Hola, clase.</i>

07:10.523 --> 07:11.940
Oh, no.
It's the salad lady.

07:12.007 --> 07:13.842
Okay. So sex...

07:13.893 --> 07:17.345
It's just like hugging,
only wetter.

07:17.397 --> 07:18.513
Yeah, it is.

07:18.564 --> 07:20.232
Okay, so let's start
with the basics. Finn.

07:20.316 --> 07:21.516
Is it true

07:21.567 --> 07:22.901
that you thought you got
your girlfriend pregnant

07:22.985 --> 07:24.119
via hot tub?

07:24.186 --> 07:25.570
I have always been dubious.

07:26.522 --> 07:27.622
And Brittany,

07:27.690 --> 07:29.207
you think that
storks bring babies?

07:29.292 --> 07:31.543
I get my information
from Woody Woodpecker cartoons.

07:31.627 --> 07:35.130
Well, that's all gonna end
right here, right now.

07:35.197 --> 07:37.916
Because today,
we are gonna get under the covers

07:38.000 --> 07:39.801
all together

07:39.869 --> 07:42.721
- and get the ditty on the dirty.
- I'm so turned-on right now.

07:42.805 --> 07:46.091
Uh, what about those of us
who choose to remain celibate?

07:46.175 --> 07:48.810
Oh, well, I admire you.

07:48.878 --> 07:50.712
Although I think you're naive

07:50.763 --> 07:53.398
and possibly frigid,
I do admire your choice.

07:53.483 --> 07:55.233
I think this is
a good time for a song.

07:55.318 --> 07:57.352
Oh, yes. Okay.

07:57.403 --> 07:58.720
- Okay.
- Rule number one:

07:58.771 --> 08:00.322
Every intimate encounter
that you're ever going

08:00.389 --> 08:01.990
to have in your life
is going to start with

08:02.057 --> 08:04.943
a touch. Hit it!

So just remember

10:39.265 --> 10:41.266
whenever you have sex
with someone,

10:41.350 --> 10:45.353
you're having sex with everyone
they've ever had sex with.

10:45.404 --> 10:47.372
And everybody's got a random.

10:50.675 --> 10:51.859
Don't you think it's time
for the Warblers

10:51.943 --> 10:53.227
to do
a Joan Armatrading medley?

10:53.311 --> 10:55.613
Um, I'm not so sure
people know who that is.

10:55.680 --> 10:59.366
Well, well, if it isn't my sweet,
sweet Porcelain.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.534
Coach Sylvester.

11:00.619 --> 11:01.952
What are you doing here?

11:02.020 --> 11:03.654
Oh, just picking up
some coffee.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.290
I like my enemas piping hot.

11:06.357 --> 11:07.858
Actually, boys, I heard

11:07.909 --> 11:10.644
that this was a Dalton
Academy hangout, and I come

11:10.712 --> 11:12.880
in a spirit of fellowship.

11:12.964 --> 11:14.767
As you no doubt have heard,
I've taken over

11:14.790 --> 11:16.974
for the coach of Aural Intensity.

11:16.998 --> 11:17.918
We heard you pushed him
down the stairs.

11:18.003 --> 11:19.303
No, you can't prove that.

11:19.370 --> 11:22.089
This is just sort of
how she talks.

11:22.173 --> 11:26.093
So, I happen to have
some top secret intel.

11:26.177 --> 11:27.561
<i>Will Schuester
has finally realized</i>

11:27.646 --> 11:29.513
<i>that his team's Achilles' heel</i>

11:29.564 --> 11:31.565
<i>is their utter lack
of sex appeal.</i>

11:31.650 --> 11:35.986
The New Directions
are getting sexy.

11:36.054 --> 11:38.355
And the key to Regionals
is out-sexing them.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.390
And I suspect

11:40.442 --> 11:44.161
that the judges are scoring
extra for it this year.

11:44.228 --> 11:45.829
So, Porcelain,

11:45.897 --> 11:47.831
<i>quid pro quo</i> :

11:49.167 --> 11:51.085
What do you have for me?

11:51.169 --> 11:54.738
I'm sorry, Coach,
but you and are not in cahoots.

11:54.789 --> 11:56.340
Probably should have
nailed that down

11:56.407 --> 11:59.376
before I gave you
my top secret intel.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.178
Porcelain,

12:01.245 --> 12:04.682
you just made a powerful enema.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.352
We got to hold an
emergency meeting.

12:08.419 --> 12:10.137
- Why?
- Weren't you listening?

12:10.221 --> 12:12.422
The judges at Regionals
have an eye out

12:12.474 --> 12:14.158
for something new,
which means...

12:14.225 --> 12:18.612
The Warblers got to do
something sexy-fied.

12:20.648 --> 12:22.616
I am very disappointed
in you, Will.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.318
Letting Holly come in and just

12:24.402 --> 12:25.936
teach the Glee kids
about... stuff.

12:25.987 --> 12:28.438
I mean, why didn't you
just pair them up, huh?

12:28.490 --> 12:29.773
Rent them a bunch
of motel rooms?

12:29.824 --> 12:31.775
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I had no choice, Emma.

12:31.826 --> 12:33.744
These kids are
totally unprepared.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.212
Look, in the spirit
of fairness,

12:35.279 --> 12:37.498
why don't you and the kids
in your Celibacy Club

12:37.582 --> 12:38.949
come in and do a number?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.135
What, like, sing?

12:41.219 --> 12:44.471
Yeah. We're trying
to teach through song.

12:44.556 --> 12:47.457
And yours can be
a counterargument to Holly's.

12:47.509 --> 12:50.144
Well, I look forward
to the opportunity

12:50.228 --> 12:51.845
to nail her to the wall.

12:53.181 --> 12:55.799
You know what I mean.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.937
Well, Puckerman,
it's your lucky day.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.972
You're finally going
to let me motorboat those twins?

13:02.023 --> 13:04.691
Remember I told you I had
a master plan? Here it is.

13:04.776 --> 13:06.827
Can you think of a celebrity
who released a tape

13:06.911 --> 13:08.979
of their intimate relations that
didn't make them more famous?

13:09.047 --> 13:10.364
If this is going
where I think it's going,

13:10.448 --> 13:11.648
I may need to sit down.

13:11.699 --> 13:13.417
Rachel Berry wants to
be a famous singer.

13:13.484 --> 13:14.918
I just want to be famous.

13:14.986 --> 13:16.670
Doing that number for Glee Club

13:16.755 --> 13:18.822
was my first step
toward being a star.

13:18.873 --> 13:20.457
I want to be like a Kardashian.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.209
I want a TV show
and a fragrance.

13:22.293 --> 13:23.877
It'll be called Zizes,

13:23.962 --> 13:26.096
and the slogan will be
"You just got Ziced!"

13:27.932 --> 13:30.467
I'm not sure I heard
that last part right,

13:30.518 --> 13:32.186
'cause I'm getting
a little light-headed,

13:32.270 --> 13:34.888
but if we make one
of those tape, that means...

13:34.973 --> 13:38.341
Wow. If your lovemaking
prowess is as impressive

13:38.393 --> 13:41.278
as your skills at deduction,
I'm in for a wild night.

13:41.345 --> 13:43.063
I would like
to welcome the ladies

13:43.148 --> 13:44.832
of our sister school,
Crawford Country Day.

13:44.899 --> 13:48.068
As you know,
the Warblers are competing

13:48.153 --> 13:50.154
in our show choir's Regionals
competition next week.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.022
So, what we're going for here

13:52.073 --> 13:55.542
today, ladies,
is something a little...

13:55.627 --> 13:57.828
A little sexy.

13:57.879 --> 13:58.829
But we need your input.

13:58.880 --> 14:02.249
Are we scream worthy?

14:02.333 --> 14:04.251
Do we make your knees
turn to jelly?

14:04.335 --> 14:08.505
So, without further ado,
hang on to your bobby socks, girls,

14:08.556 --> 14:10.924
'cause we're about
to rock your world.

Sweet, but not on your team.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.439
Are you okay?

16:22.506 --> 16:23.807
You kept making

16:23.858 --> 16:25.943
those weird faces
the whole song.

16:26.010 --> 16:27.394
Those weren't weird faces.

16:27.462 --> 16:29.229
Those were my sexy faces.

16:29.314 --> 16:32.332
It just looked like
you were having gas pains

16:32.400 --> 16:33.900
or something.

16:33.985 --> 16:36.570
Great. How are we supposed to
get up on the stage at Regionals

16:36.654 --> 16:39.623
and sell sexy to the judges when
I have as much sexual appeal

16:39.690 --> 16:41.041
and knowledge as a baby penguin?

16:41.125 --> 16:43.010
We'll figure something out.

16:47.602 --> 16:50.321
I want to talk
to you about something.

16:50.388 --> 16:52.940
I really like
when we make out and stuff.

16:53.024 --> 16:54.725
Which isn't cheating,
because...?

16:54.776 --> 16:58.312
- The plumbing's different.
- Mm-hmm.

16:58.380 --> 16:59.864
But when Artie
and I are together,

16:59.915 --> 17:01.081
we talk about stuff,
like feelings.

17:01.166 --> 17:02.500
Why?

17:02.567 --> 17:04.602
Because with feelings,
it's better.

17:04.669 --> 17:06.069
Are you kidding?

17:06.121 --> 17:08.405
It's better when it
doesn't involve feelings.

17:08.455 --> 17:10.240
I think it's better when it
doesn't involve eye contact.

17:10.291 --> 17:13.627
I don't know. I guess I just
don't know how I feel about us.

17:13.712 --> 17:14.912
Look...

17:14.963 --> 17:16.246
Let's be clear here.

17:16.298 --> 17:18.015
I'm not interested
in any labels,

17:18.082 --> 17:20.284
unless it's on something
I shoplift.

17:20.352 --> 17:21.785
I don't know, Santana.

17:21.853 --> 17:23.554
I think
we should talk to somebody.

17:23.605 --> 17:25.055
Like an adult.

17:25.106 --> 17:26.773
This relationship
is really confusing for me.

17:26.858 --> 17:28.409
Breakfast is confusing for you.

17:28.476 --> 17:30.845
Well, sometimes it's sweet,
and sometimes it's salty.

17:30.912 --> 17:33.781
Like, what if I have eggs for dinner?
Then what is it?

17:36.267 --> 17:37.434
Those linens are incredible.

17:37.485 --> 17:38.869
I know.
Is that Egyptian cotton?

17:38.937 --> 17:41.455
Why do they keep editing all
this vacation and plane stuff?

17:41.540 --> 17:42.923
It classes it up.

17:42.991 --> 17:45.876
If I want to see Kim Kardashian
being classy, I'll watch E!

17:45.944 --> 17:47.077
Touch me.

17:47.128 --> 17:49.780
We're not putting any
of that stuff in ours.

17:49.831 --> 17:51.632
- Well, maybe...
- Hey, guys. What's going on?

17:51.716 --> 17:54.335
- Oh, hey, Miss H. Hey, can you help us out?
- Uh, yeah.

17:54.419 --> 17:56.470
Lauren and I are gonna
make a sex tape.

17:56.555 --> 17:58.055
So I can get a
recording contract.

17:58.122 --> 17:59.390
Wow. Okay.

17:59.457 --> 18:00.891
Well, first, can I just say

18:00.959 --> 18:03.060
that I'm very impressed
by not only your ambition,

18:03.127 --> 18:05.479
but by how comfortable you are
with your own bodies?

18:05.564 --> 18:07.681
Easy to be comfortable
when you look this good.

18:07.766 --> 18:08.816
- You know what I mean?
- Agreed.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.818
Uh, now for the downside.

18:10.902 --> 18:13.404
Are you aware that because
you're under eighteen years of age,

18:13.471 --> 18:15.806
making and owning a sex tape
could make you guilty

18:15.857 --> 18:18.025
of child pornography?

18:18.109 --> 18:21.028
Listen, guys, don't take this
too hard, all right?

18:21.112 --> 18:23.197
These things just...
They never work out well.

18:23.281 --> 18:27.651
My sex tape with J.D. Salinger
was a disaster.

18:27.702 --> 18:31.338
- Thanks, Miss H.
- Later, dudes.

18:31.423 --> 18:32.623
Ladies.

18:32.674 --> 18:34.925
Miss Holiday,
we need your help.

18:36.461 --> 18:38.712
So, why are we
sitting on the floor?

18:38.797 --> 18:40.714
'Cause we're in Japan.

18:40.799 --> 18:42.549
No.

18:42.634 --> 18:46.503
Welcome to my sacred,
sexy sharing circle.

18:46.554 --> 18:49.006
I want to thank you guys
for confiding in me,

18:49.057 --> 18:50.641
'cause I know this is tough.

18:50.692 --> 18:52.726
And I want to ask both of you

18:52.811 --> 18:56.513
if either one of you thinks
that you might be a lesbian.

18:56.564 --> 18:58.699
I don't know.

18:58.783 --> 19:00.200
Yeah, I mean, who knows?

19:00.285 --> 19:03.537
I'm attracted to girls,
and I'm attracted to guys.

19:03.622 --> 19:05.205
I've made out with a mannequin.

19:05.290 --> 19:07.458
I even had a sex
dream about a shrub

19:07.525 --> 19:09.693
that was just in the
shape of a person.

19:09.744 --> 19:11.795
Hmm. Well, we've all been there.

19:11.863 --> 19:13.747
I went to an all-girls college

19:13.832 --> 19:16.050
where the only industry
in the town

19:16.134 --> 19:18.702
was the manufacturing
of softball equipment.

19:18.753 --> 19:22.556
I still feel a little tingle
when I hear Ani DiFranco.

19:22.641 --> 19:25.559
Ooh!

19:25.644 --> 19:26.877
Anyway, it's not about

19:26.928 --> 19:28.595
who you are attracted to,
ultimately.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.597
It's about who you
fall in love with.

19:30.682 --> 19:32.816
Well, I don't know how I feel,

19:32.884 --> 19:35.218
because Santana refuses
to talk about it.

19:35.270 --> 19:38.772
Okay, well, I know talking about
feelings can be really hard,

19:38.857 --> 19:41.408
so I have an idea.

19:41.493 --> 19:43.911
Why don't you guys find a song

19:43.995 --> 19:46.897
and see if maybe the lyrics
of the song could help you

19:46.948 --> 19:49.149
start a dialogue going?

19:49.217 --> 19:50.751
I could be down with that.

19:50.835 --> 19:54.204
I have the perfect song.

19:54.255 --> 19:55.739
There's just one problem, though.

19:55.790 --> 19:58.926
Brit and I may need your help
to sing it.

19:59.010 --> 20:01.612
I thought you'd never ask.

20:02.664 --> 20:04.965
All right, so give me sensual.

20:05.050 --> 20:07.384
But don't make fun of it.
Like, really try.

20:11.189 --> 20:14.058
Okay. Now give me... sultry.

20:18.580 --> 20:21.431
Um, Kurt, they're all
sort of looking the same.

20:21.483 --> 20:24.051
That's because the face I'm
actually doing is uncomfortable.

20:24.119 --> 20:25.569
This is pointless, Blaine.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.321
I don't know how to be sexy,

20:27.405 --> 20:29.323
because I don't know
the first thing about sex.

20:29.407 --> 20:30.941
Kurt, you're blushing.

20:30.992 --> 20:33.160
I've tried watching
those movies,

20:33.244 --> 20:34.528
but I just get
horribly depressed.

20:34.596 --> 20:36.130
And I think about how
they were all kids once,

20:36.214 --> 20:37.414
and they all have mothers.

20:37.465 --> 20:38.665
And, God, what would
their mothers think?

20:38.750 --> 20:40.117
And why would you get
that tattoo there?

20:40.168 --> 20:41.785
Then maybe we should have
a conversation about it.

20:41.836 --> 20:43.420
I'll tell you what I know.

20:43.471 --> 20:45.589
I don't... I don't want to
know the graphic details.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.141
I like romance.

20:47.208 --> 20:49.560
That's why I like
Broadway musicals,

20:49.627 --> 20:51.294
because the touch
of the fingertips

20:51.346 --> 20:53.313
is as sexy as it gets.

20:53.398 --> 20:55.015
Kurt, you're going to have
to learn about it someday.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.567
Well, not today.

20:56.634 --> 20:59.036
I think I've learned quite
enough for today, thank you.

20:59.087 --> 21:00.621
I think you should leave.

21:05.910 --> 21:07.261
So just nice and easy.
I don't want

21:07.345 --> 21:08.929
to go too far away
from the original version.

21:09.013 --> 21:10.097
Since when do you need help

21:10.181 --> 21:11.215
singing in front
of the Glee Club?

21:11.266 --> 21:12.749
Oh, it's not about the singing.

21:12.801 --> 21:14.685
I'm trying to make Prince's
"Kiss" into a tango.

21:14.752 --> 21:16.103
Just want to make sure
it's appropriate.

21:16.187 --> 21:18.255
"Kiss" as a tango?

21:18.306 --> 21:21.191
That's awesome and ridiculous.

21:21.259 --> 21:23.727
Anyway, I want to do this right
for the sexy lesson.

21:23.778 --> 21:24.895
So picture us

21:24.946 --> 21:26.613
in the auditorium,
big backdrop,

21:26.698 --> 21:30.200
lighting, costume,
the whole thing.

21:33.621 --> 21:35.272

23:47.789 --> 23:49.572
Oh, you don't want any of this.

23:49.624 --> 23:51.008
I'm damaged goods.

23:51.075 --> 23:52.960
Yes, it makes me
terrific in bed,

23:53.044 --> 23:55.745
but it also means I tend
to break nice guys like you

23:55.797 --> 23:57.580
into Wasa crackers.

23:57.632 --> 23:59.416
Oh, I think I can handle it.

23:59.467 --> 24:01.751
You married
your high school sweetheart,

24:01.803 --> 24:03.437
and then you went out
with a virgin.

24:04.973 --> 24:07.724
It's a great song.

24:07.775 --> 24:09.426
You don't need me, though.
The kids are going to love it.

24:18.586 --> 24:21.204
Need a hand?

24:23.207 --> 24:24.941
Yeah, why don't you hand
me that carburetor?

24:27.829 --> 24:29.796
How'd you know
which one it was?

24:29.881 --> 24:32.299
My dad and I
rebuilt a '59 Chevy

24:32.383 --> 24:33.633
in our driveway
two summers ago.

24:33.718 --> 24:36.286
One of his many
attempts at bonding.

24:36.337 --> 24:38.955
- You here looking for parts?
- No, actually.

24:39.006 --> 24:40.340
I, uh, wanted to talk
to you about Kurt.

24:40.425 --> 24:42.008
Is he okay?

24:42.093 --> 24:45.462
Have you ever talked
to him about sex?

24:45.513 --> 24:48.181
Are you gay
or straight or what?

24:48.266 --> 24:51.935
- I'm definitely gay.
- Okay. Good.

24:51.986 --> 24:54.187
I mean, you know,
whatever, but, uh...

24:54.272 --> 24:55.472
You know, good for Kurt.

24:55.523 --> 24:58.308
He needs someone like you
to talk to.

24:58.359 --> 25:00.410
Well, that's kind of my point.

25:00.478 --> 25:01.862
I've tried talking to him,

25:01.946 --> 25:03.914
but he basically puts his
fingers in his ears

25:03.981 --> 25:05.315
and starts singing.

25:05.366 --> 25:07.751
Well, when he's ready,
he'll listen.

25:07.818 --> 25:09.503
I'm worried that
it might be too late.

25:09.587 --> 25:12.622
You know, Dalton doesn't
even have sex ed classes.

25:12.673 --> 25:14.324
Most schools don't,
and the ones that do

25:14.375 --> 25:16.326
almost never discuss what
sex is like for gay kids.

25:16.377 --> 25:20.830
Kurt is... is the most moral,

25:20.882 --> 25:22.716
compassionate person
I've ever met.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.601
You know, he gets that
from his mother.

25:24.668 --> 25:27.354
And... And I am blown away
by your guys' relationship.

25:27.438 --> 25:30.791
You think my dad built a car
with me because he loves cars?

25:30.858 --> 25:32.008
I think he did it

25:32.059 --> 25:34.144
because he thought
getting my hands dirty

25:34.195 --> 25:36.012
might make me straight.

25:36.080 --> 25:41.118
You know, did he talk to you
about this, uh, kind of stuff?

25:41.185 --> 25:43.820
No. I had to go
find it for myself.

25:43.871 --> 25:46.523
The Internet is great,
and all the information is out there,

25:46.574 --> 25:47.791
but I went searching for it.

25:47.858 --> 25:49.409
Kurt won't.

25:49.494 --> 25:50.961
And one day,
he'll be at a party,

25:51.028 --> 25:53.964
and maybe have a few drinks

25:54.031 --> 25:55.698
and then he'll meet some guy
and start fooling around.

25:55.750 --> 25:58.635
And he's not going to know
about using protection

25:58.702 --> 26:00.303
or STDs.

26:00.371 --> 26:02.756
I don't have the relationship

26:02.840 --> 26:05.642
with my dad
that you have with Kurt.

26:08.980 --> 26:12.599
I think it would be really cool
if you took advantage of that.

26:14.885 --> 26:16.236
I'm sorry if I'm overstepping.

Thank you.

29:15.249 --> 29:18.952
Pretty cool that our girlfriends
are such good friends, right?

29:19.036 --> 29:20.420
I wish you and I
were that close.

29:20.504 --> 29:21.888
Can I just applaud this trio

29:21.956 --> 29:25.342
for exploring the uncharted
world of Sapphic charm?

29:25.409 --> 29:26.710
<i>Brava. Brava.</i>

29:26.761 --> 29:29.813
Look, just because
I sang a song with Brittany

29:29.880 --> 29:31.514
doesn't mean that you can
put a label on me.

29:31.582 --> 29:32.716
Is that clear?

29:39.223 --> 29:41.441
This meeting of the Celibacy Club
will now come to order.

29:41.525 --> 29:43.309
Before we begin,
I would just like to start

29:43.377 --> 29:44.778
by congratulating you by
reminding you

29:44.862 --> 29:46.246
not one member of this club

29:46.313 --> 29:48.615
has had an unwanted pregnancy
in almost a year.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.066
You get tenses for menses.

29:50.117 --> 29:51.701
I'd also like to welcome
our newest member,

29:51.769 --> 29:52.902
Noah Puckerman.

29:52.953 --> 29:55.605
- Are you lost, Noah?
- Yeah, you don't belong here.

29:55.656 --> 29:56.823
You're the biggest
French whore of them all.

29:56.907 --> 29:58.324
Zizes and I were going
to make a sex tape.

29:58.409 --> 29:59.693
I found out that

29:59.760 --> 30:01.227
making that tape would have
resulted in my arrest.

30:01.295 --> 30:02.796
I've hit rock bottom,

30:02.880 --> 30:03.897
and I've come here
to set myself straight.

30:03.964 --> 30:05.215
That's just awesome, Noah.

30:05.282 --> 30:06.883
And you're just in time,
because tomorrow

30:06.950 --> 30:08.968
the girls and I are going
to perform a song for Glee Club

30:09.053 --> 30:10.953
extolling the benefits
of celibacy.

30:11.005 --> 30:12.505
I'm down for that.

30:12.590 --> 30:14.090
Point of order, though.

30:14.141 --> 30:16.176
While three chicks and me is
just a typical Saturday night

30:16.243 --> 30:17.460
in the Puckerman bedroom,

30:17.511 --> 30:18.895
it's not the best balance
for singing.

30:18.962 --> 30:20.213
We need at least one more dude.

30:20.281 --> 30:22.515
I've got that covered.

30:28.806 --> 30:30.473
♪ Gonna find my baby, ♪

30:30.524 --> 30:32.192
♪ gonna hold her tight, ♪

30:32.276 --> 30:35.478

"When it's right, it's right." ♪

of a cold, dark night? ♪

31:28.415 --> 31:31.384
- Hi. Um, Holly here.
- Yeah?

31:31.469 --> 31:32.702
So I'm a little confused.

31:32.753 --> 31:37.257
Isn't this a strange song for the...
the Celibacy Club to sing?

31:37.341 --> 31:38.892
But why?

31:38.976 --> 31:41.094
It's so wholesome.

31:41.178 --> 31:42.395
It was written during
the Bicentennial

31:42.480 --> 31:44.998
to celebrate America
and fireworks...

31:45.065 --> 31:47.767
No, it's about sneaking
out for a nooner.

31:47.852 --> 31:49.152
Yes. Exactly!

31:49.219 --> 31:51.187
A nooner's when you have
dessert in the middle

31:51.238 --> 31:52.589
of the day, right?

31:52.656 --> 31:54.340
Right, Carl?

31:54.408 --> 31:55.492
Well, regardless...

31:55.559 --> 31:57.076
It was a great job, guys.
Great number.

31:57.161 --> 31:59.445
It was...
It was fantastic.

31:59.530 --> 32:00.663
Hey, Glee Club, let's go.

32:00.731 --> 32:01.998
Miss Holliday?
Excuse me a second.

32:02.065 --> 32:03.733
Miss Holliday?

32:03.784 --> 32:05.168
You're still the, um...

32:05.235 --> 32:06.369
You're still the acting
sex-ed teacher, right?

32:06.420 --> 32:08.204
You know it, brother.

32:08.255 --> 32:11.040
Uh, you don't happen to have
any office hours, do you?

32:11.091 --> 32:12.675
- Sure.
- Afternoon Delight is a dessert.

32:12.743 --> 32:15.044
It's made with coconut
and pineapple

32:15.095 --> 32:16.262
and marshmallow fluff.

32:16.347 --> 32:18.264
I think Emma and I
need an appointment.

32:21.638 --> 32:22.972
What are those?

32:23.056 --> 32:25.841
Those are some pamphlets
that I picked up from the free clinic.

32:25.926 --> 32:27.760
I thought it might
help the process along,

32:27.811 --> 32:29.795
because it is time you
and I had "the talk."

32:29.846 --> 32:31.764
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

32:31.815 --> 32:33.349
- You told me to educate myself.
- La, la, la!

32:33.433 --> 32:35.234
- La, la, la!
- Hey, you think this is easy for me?

32:35.301 --> 32:36.602
- La, la, la, la!
- Okay, believe me,

32:36.653 --> 32:38.404
I want to do this even
less than you do.

32:38.471 --> 32:40.472
This is going to suck
for both of us,

32:40.524 --> 32:42.825
but we are going
to get through it together,

32:42.909 --> 32:44.827
and we will both be
better men because of it.

32:46.997 --> 32:49.165
Now, first, most of the, um...

32:49.249 --> 32:51.917
mechanics of what you're going

32:51.985 --> 32:54.036
to be doing is covered
in the pamphlets.

32:54.121 --> 32:58.323
Okay, so, I want you to read them,
and then I want you to come talk

32:58.375 --> 32:59.992
to me about it.

33:00.043 --> 33:02.011
Deal?

33:02.095 --> 33:03.763
Okay.

33:03.830 --> 33:05.965
All right. Now.
Hey, sit down.

33:06.016 --> 33:07.516
We're just getting started.

33:07.601 --> 33:08.801
All right.

33:08.852 --> 33:11.103
You know, for most guys,
sex is just... You know...

33:11.171 --> 33:12.471
It's this thing
we always want to do.

33:12.522 --> 33:14.190
You know, it's fun.

33:14.274 --> 33:15.608
It feels great.

33:15.675 --> 33:17.643
But we're not really thinking
too much about, you know,

33:17.694 --> 33:21.313
how it makes us feel on
the inside or, you know,

33:21.364 --> 33:23.866
how the other person
feels about it.

33:23.950 --> 33:25.568
Women are different?

33:25.652 --> 33:28.537
Only because they get that
it's about something more

33:28.622 --> 33:30.823
than just the physical.

33:30.874 --> 33:33.959
You know, when... When you're
intimate with somebody

33:34.027 --> 33:37.913
in that way,
you're exposing yourself.

33:37.998 --> 33:41.000
You know, you're never going
to be more vulnerable,

33:41.051 --> 33:43.469
and that scares the hell
out of a lot of guys.

33:43.536 --> 33:47.056
Believe me, I can't tell
you how many buddies I've got

33:47.140 --> 33:50.292
who have gotten in
way too deep with a girl

33:50.360 --> 33:52.711
who said she was cool
with just hooking up.

33:52.763 --> 33:54.430
But that's not going
to happen to me, Dad.

33:54.514 --> 33:56.232
No. It's going to be worse.

33:56.316 --> 33:57.883
Okay? Because it's two guys.

33:57.934 --> 33:59.301
With two guys,

33:59.369 --> 34:02.855
you've got two people
who think that sex is just sex.

34:02.906 --> 34:04.907
It's gonna be
easier to come by.

34:04.991 --> 34:06.025
And once you start
doing this stuff,

34:06.076 --> 34:07.392
you're not going
to want to stop.

34:07.444 --> 34:09.445
You just... You've got to know
that it means something.

34:09.529 --> 34:12.915
You know,
it's doing something to you,

34:12.998 --> 34:16.452
to your heart,
to your self-esteem,

34:16.536 --> 34:19.338
even though it feels like
you're just having fun.

34:19.405 --> 34:22.858
So, you're saying I
shouldn't have sex?

34:22.926 --> 34:27.279
I think on your thirtieth birthday,
it is a great gift to yourself.

34:29.099 --> 34:31.083
Kurt...

34:31.134 --> 34:34.270
When you're ready...

34:34.353 --> 34:38.724
I want you to be able to...

34:38.775 --> 34:40.775
Do everything.

34:40.844 --> 34:42.862
But when you're ready,
I want you

34:42.929 --> 34:47.632
to use it as a way
to connect to another person.

34:47.701 --> 34:49.601
Don't throw yourself around

34:49.652 --> 34:51.654
like you don't matter.

34:51.737 --> 34:55.190
'Cause you matter, Kurt.

34:58.795 --> 35:00.779
Is that it?

35:00.831 --> 35:03.115
That's it. For now.

35:03.166 --> 35:04.583
Can I make you some toast?

35:04.634 --> 35:06.669
I think I'll take
it up to my room

35:06.753 --> 35:09.839
to eat while I look
over my new pamphlets.

35:12.676 --> 35:16.061
- Thank you, Dad.
- You're welcome.

35:24.688 --> 35:26.689
Now, I hear you guys are
having some problems.

35:26.773 --> 35:28.190
- I wouldn't call them problems.
- No, we are.

35:28.275 --> 35:29.525
We really, really are.
We're having problems.

35:29.609 --> 35:31.577
When is the last time
that you...

35:31.644 --> 35:33.712
- Never.
- I beg your pardon?

35:33.780 --> 35:35.447
We've been married four months

35:35.498 --> 35:36.815
and we still haven't
done the deed.

35:36.867 --> 35:38.784
Girlfriend,
what is up with that?

35:38.835 --> 35:40.169
He's hot!

35:40.253 --> 35:41.871
You're thirty.

35:41.955 --> 35:43.455
I haven't felt comfortable.

35:43.506 --> 35:46.842
- So...
- Well, what is it that you do?

35:46.927 --> 35:49.261
Um, okay...

35:49.329 --> 35:50.495
So we cuddle a lot.

35:50.547 --> 35:51.547
- A lot.
- A lot.

35:51.631 --> 35:52.831
- We cuddle too much.
- Oh, well, no...

35:52.883 --> 35:54.283
- We're... We're cuddle monsters.
- Okay. Okay.

35:54.351 --> 35:56.001
We... We watch
the <i>Housewives</i> shows,

35:56.052 --> 35:57.269
which are so, so racy. Racy!

35:57.337 --> 35:58.888
It's not like I haven't tried.
I try.

35:58.955 --> 35:59.855
I've made her romantic dinners.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.056
I give her roses,

36:01.141 --> 36:02.641
and every time I try
to touch her...

36:02.692 --> 36:04.693
That happens.

36:04.778 --> 36:06.812
I'm so sorry.

36:06.863 --> 36:09.698
Okay, look.
I am not a doctor, okay?

36:09.783 --> 36:11.367
I don't even
like doctor TV shows.

36:11.451 --> 36:14.519
Unless it's one of those ones
where people strap bombs

36:14.571 --> 36:16.989
to their chest.
Love those.

36:17.040 --> 36:20.492
So I would like
to ask you a question,

36:20.543 --> 36:24.413
and I want you to answer it
very seriously.

36:24.481 --> 36:28.033
Are you still in love
with Will Schuester?

36:28.084 --> 36:29.902
You know, I was sort
of thinking the same thing,

36:29.970 --> 36:32.537
but I was afraid to ask it.

36:32.589 --> 36:33.989
- Um...
- Are you?

36:36.009 --> 36:40.596
I feel very confused
about my feelings.

36:40.664 --> 36:42.598
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

36:42.682 --> 36:44.600
No, you and your feelings
can stay at the condo,

36:44.668 --> 36:46.151
and I'll be at the Radisson.

36:46.219 --> 36:48.070
Thank you, Doctor.

36:50.991 --> 36:52.491
Not a doctor.

36:54.060 --> 36:57.947
Could you please,
please not tell Will about this?

36:58.031 --> 37:00.532
- No, of course not. Of course not.
- Okay.

37:00.583 --> 37:02.918
- My lips are sealed.
- Okay, thank you.

37:03.003 --> 37:05.087
Just like your legs!

37:05.171 --> 37:06.505
Oh. Ha. Kidding!

37:06.572 --> 37:07.840
God. That was rude.

37:07.907 --> 37:09.908
Why did I say that?

37:09.960 --> 37:12.094
See, a real doctor would
never have said that.

37:12.178 --> 37:14.096
Whew.

37:17.434 --> 37:19.935
- Hi.
- Hey.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.920
- Can we talk?
- But we never do that.

37:21.972 --> 37:24.640
I know, but, um,
I wanted to thank you...

37:24.724 --> 37:27.426
for performing that song
with me in Glee Club.

37:27.477 --> 37:28.610
Yeah.

37:28.695 --> 37:31.763
'Cause it's made me do
a lot of thinking.

37:31.815 --> 37:38.437
What I've realized is why
I'm such a bitch all the time.

37:38.488 --> 37:41.824
I'm a bitch because I'm angry.

37:41.891 --> 37:45.527
I'm angry because I have
all of these feelings...

37:45.595 --> 37:50.215
Feelings for you...
that I'm afraid of dealing with,

37:50.283 --> 37:54.386
because I'm afraid of dealing
with the consequences.

37:54.454 --> 37:56.055
And Brittany,

37:56.122 --> 37:59.341
I can't go to an Indigo Girls
concert. I just can't.

37:59.426 --> 38:00.726
I understand that.

38:00.793 --> 38:05.164
Do you understand what
I'm trying to say here?

38:05.231 --> 38:07.950
Not really.

38:11.137 --> 38:14.957
I want to be with you.

38:15.025 --> 38:18.810
But I'm afraid of the talks,
and the looks.

38:18.862 --> 38:21.480
I mean, you know what happened
to Kurt at this school.

38:21.531 --> 38:26.318
But, honey... If anybody were
to ever make fun of you,

38:26.369 --> 38:28.253
you would either kick their ass

38:28.321 --> 38:30.422
or slash them with your vicious,
vicious words.

38:30.490 --> 38:34.126
Yeah, I know. But...

38:34.177 --> 38:36.845
I'm so afraid of what everyone
will say behind my back.

38:36.930 --> 38:39.498
Still, I have to accept...

38:39.549 --> 38:42.084
that I love you.

38:44.003 --> 38:45.170
I love <i>you</i>.

38:45.221 --> 38:47.639
And I don't want to
be with Sam or Finn

38:47.690 --> 38:50.442
or any of those other guys.

38:50.510 --> 38:51.977
I just want you.

38:53.780 --> 38:56.698
Please say you love me back.

38:56.766 --> 39:01.203
- Please...
- Of course I love you. I do.

39:01.287 --> 39:03.405
And I would totally
be with you,

39:03.490 --> 39:04.723
if it weren't for Artie.

39:04.791 --> 39:06.825
Artie?

39:06.876 --> 39:09.995
I love him, too.

39:10.046 --> 39:12.164
I don't want to hurt him,
that's not right.

39:12.215 --> 39:13.665
I can't break up with him.

39:13.716 --> 39:16.585
Yes, you can.
He's just a stupid boy.

39:16.669 --> 39:18.170
But it wouldn't be right.

39:18.221 --> 39:20.556
Santana, you have to know...

39:20.640 --> 39:24.510
If Artie and I were
to ever break up,

39:24.561 --> 39:26.812
and I'm lucky enough
that you're still single...

39:26.879 --> 39:29.565
Don't.

39:29.632 --> 39:32.901
I am so yours.

39:32.986 --> 39:35.554
Proudly so.

39:35.605 --> 39:38.157
Yeah, wow.

39:38.224 --> 39:42.227
Whoever thought that being fluid
meant you could be so stuck?

39:42.278 --> 39:44.496
I'm sorry.
Don't...

39:44.564 --> 39:47.166
- Get off me.
- I'm sorry.

39:54.291 --> 39:56.008
Nerd.

39:56.093 --> 39:58.127
Whoa! Why you gotta hate?

39:58.178 --> 40:00.596
You joined the Celibacy Club?

40:00.647 --> 40:02.682
What the hell?

40:02.766 --> 40:04.317
I thought you and me
were an item. Lauren.

40:04.401 --> 40:07.653
Stop. I need to talk
to you about something.

40:07.738 --> 40:08.821
I realized something lately.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.273
I do a lot of stupid things.

40:10.324 --> 40:12.475
Once, on a dare,
I swallowed a thumbtack.

40:12.526 --> 40:14.077
I'm about 90% sure
it's still in there.

40:14.144 --> 40:15.644
I don't think about
consequences.

40:15.696 --> 40:18.197
And while I used to
think that made me cool,

40:18.282 --> 40:20.116
now I just think it
makes me a loser.

40:20.167 --> 40:23.119
I like you, Lauren.
I like wooing you.

40:23.170 --> 40:24.420
Next to dropping
my afternoon deuce,

40:24.488 --> 40:25.705
it's my favorite
part of the day.

40:25.789 --> 40:27.656
So I'm making a change.

40:27.708 --> 40:30.159
And if that makes
me a nerd, fine.

40:30.210 --> 40:32.712
I really do have
the urge to punch you.

40:37.851 --> 40:41.687
If we can play footsie
in Celibacy Club, I'm in.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.639
Nerd.

40:49.196 --> 40:51.364
I hereby call the Celibacy Club
to order.

40:51.448 --> 40:53.149
Where's Ms. Pillsbury?

40:53.200 --> 40:55.151
She decided to take
the hour she was spending here

40:55.202 --> 40:57.036
to use it to fix her
sham of a marriage.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.488
In the interim,
I'll be taking over.

40:58.539 --> 40:59.956
Because you annoyingly
take over everything?

41:00.023 --> 41:02.792
Because I realized that

41:02.859 --> 41:05.495
while all of us making our
celibacy pledge is wonderful,

41:05.546 --> 41:08.214
one day we're going to
fall in love with someone,

41:08.298 --> 41:10.550
and we're going to choose
to be intimate with them.

41:10.634 --> 41:13.052
Speaking of being intimate...
What's with the hickey, Quinn?

41:13.137 --> 41:14.637
It's not a hickey.

41:14.704 --> 41:17.473
Oh, I know hickeys.
I'm a freakin' connoisseur.

41:17.541 --> 41:19.708
I can make them into shapes,
like balloon animals.

41:19.760 --> 41:22.645
I burnt myself this
morning with a curling iron.

41:22.712 --> 41:24.847
The key is to use the
curling iron in the bathtub

41:24.898 --> 41:26.098
to keep you from getting burnt.

41:26.183 --> 41:27.517
No.

41:27.568 --> 41:30.169
<i>I was sure I was caught.</i>

41:32.139 --> 41:33.222
What was that?

41:33.273 --> 41:35.525
Is that your mom?

41:35.576 --> 41:38.945
She's at work.
She won't be home for hours.

41:39.029 --> 41:41.030
Divorce rules.

41:41.081 --> 41:42.999
Come here.

41:46.403 --> 41:48.404
Ooh!

41:48.455 --> 41:50.756
I'll be more careful with the
hickey placement next time.

41:50.841 --> 41:52.158
This is so awesome.

41:52.226 --> 41:54.677
We have two months until Prom,
so we have plenty of time

41:54.745 --> 41:56.379
to campaign for
Prom King and Queen.

41:56.430 --> 41:59.632
But that's not all this is about,
though, right?

41:59.700 --> 42:03.352
Look, I made a mistake
with Puck.

42:03.420 --> 42:06.205
You should have been my first.

42:09.726 --> 42:11.644
This is where I belong.

42:11.712 --> 42:16.866
- With you. Okay?
- Okay.

42:18.402 --> 42:19.986
Hey, hot stuff.

42:20.070 --> 42:22.822
Holly. Hey.

42:22.906 --> 42:24.490
I'm just, uh, walking through
some choreography.

42:24.575 --> 42:26.959
Got Regionals in a week,
and I just want to make sure

42:27.044 --> 42:29.295
all the dances are what
I like to call "Finn-proof."

42:29.379 --> 42:32.048
Oh, well, I won't keep you.

42:32.115 --> 42:34.600
I just, um,
just came to say good-bye.

42:34.668 --> 42:37.803
I'm going over to Shawnee
Township to teach algebra.

42:37.888 --> 42:39.639
Really?

42:39.723 --> 42:43.792
Yeah. There were some
parent complaints.

42:43.844 --> 42:45.978
Apparently, my cucumber
demonstration

42:46.063 --> 42:48.464
made it impossible
to watch <i>VeggieTales</i>

42:48.515 --> 42:49.899
the same way ever again.

42:49.966 --> 42:53.402
I personally thought it made
watching that show hilarious.

42:53.470 --> 42:56.656
Uh, wow, I...

42:56.740 --> 42:59.475
I really don't want
to say good-bye.

43:01.645 --> 43:04.330
Then maybe we shouldn't.

43:04.414 --> 43:07.116
Teaching Santana and Brittany
how to get their Stevie Nicks on

43:07.184 --> 43:11.370
made me realize how
closed off I've been.

43:11.455 --> 43:13.506
I'm getting older, too.
Maybe I should try

43:13.590 --> 43:17.076
a relationship that lasts
more than thirty-six hours.

43:18.262 --> 43:20.346
You're serious?

43:20.430 --> 43:22.298
Plus, seeing another woman
with the hots for you

43:22.349 --> 43:23.966
kinda made me jealous...

43:24.017 --> 43:26.135
- Wait, what?
- Oh, nothing.

43:27.504 --> 43:30.339
I know a lot about sex,
Will, but...

43:30.390 --> 43:33.809
Maybe it's time I learned a
little something about romance.

43:37.197 --> 43:40.483
Well, I don't know
if you've heard...

43:42.703 --> 43:45.321
But I happen to be
an excellent educator.
