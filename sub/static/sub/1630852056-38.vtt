00:07.799 --> 00:10.734

Services on me, called the police.

00:10.833 --> 00:13.066
You had your kids sleeping in a
basement.

00:13.132 --> 00:14.199

00:14.266 --> 00:15.833

00:58.834 --> 01:00.165
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:01.299 --> 01:03.899
[Judge Judy] Ms. Elam,
when did you meet the defendant?

01:03.966 --> 01:05.834
[Javala] I met the defendant, Ms.
Weems

01:05.900 --> 01:09.132
around November, December,
I should say.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.632
- [Judge Judy] Of 2020?
- [Javala] Yes.

01:10.700 --> 01:11.900
- [Judge Judy] Where did you meet her?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.632
I met her through a friend, actually.

01:13.799 --> 01:14.834
Tell me how.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.700
[Javala] She was helping
me out at my hard times...

01:17.766 --> 01:19.066
[Judge Judy] Who was helping you
out?

01:19.200 --> 01:20.233
[Javala] Ms. Weems.

01:20.332 --> 01:21.667
[Judge Judy] No, how did you meet
her?

01:21.900 --> 01:24.400
I met her through my--
I met her through my best friend,

01:24.466 --> 01:26.066
she's my--my best friend

01:26.132 --> 01:29.900
is cousins with her kids' daycare
teacher.

01:29.966 --> 01:32.265
She runs a daycare
and my best friend's cousin

01:32.332 --> 01:33.500
go to her daycare.

01:33.567 --> 01:37.000
And Ms. Weems was buying stamps and
she--

01:37.066 --> 01:38.233
[Judge Judy] Buying what?

01:38.299 --> 01:39.700
Buying food stamps.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.033
She was buying food stamps from whom?

01:42.099 --> 01:45.265
From everybody, me included.

01:45.332 --> 01:47.466
Me and some other people, anybody--

01:47.533 --> 01:51.099
um, her daycare kids' parents,
she's buying from.

01:51.165 --> 01:53.200
She keeps cards

01:53.265 --> 01:56.200
cause she, she has a daycare.

01:56.265 --> 01:58.466
[Judge Judy] Okay.
So you say she buys some,

01:58.533 --> 02:00.466
- she gives you money for them?
- Yes.

02:00.533 --> 02:04.432
[Judge Judy] So you get
a supply of food stamps

02:04.500 --> 02:07.132
for a month or for a week?

02:07.200 --> 02:08.265
Explain to me how that works.

02:08.332 --> 02:11.165
Um, well, the pandemic,
um, being going on,

02:11.233 --> 02:13.900
so they've been giving us food
stamps,

02:13.967 --> 02:15.933
like pandemic stamps they call them.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.599
And that's how I was able--

02:17.667 --> 02:19.966
- How often?
- [Javala] Like, twice a month.

02:20.033 --> 02:23.099
Like, minus the--
minus the regular, you know,

02:23.165 --> 02:24.800
time you get your stamps,

02:24.866 --> 02:27.165
they give it to you, like, twice,
three times a month,

02:27.233 --> 02:28.933
like constantly.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
[Judge Judy] Okay.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.966
So they give you
more than you actually need

02:32.033 --> 02:33.933
for your family, so you sell them?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.466
- Well, I--
- [Judge Judy] If she buys them,

02:35.533 --> 02:37.000
then you have to sell them?

02:37.066 --> 02:38.900
Right. But I don't have a fam--

02:38.966 --> 02:42.332
I have a daughter, yes,
but I put food in the home...

02:42.400 --> 02:43.366
[Judge Judy] I'm talking about--

02:43.432 --> 02:45.099
I'm just trying to understand.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.300
How much does she pay you
for the food stamps?

02:48.766 --> 02:50.900
Oh, like, um, say, if I was to sell
her

02:50.966 --> 02:53.866
a hundred dollars in stamps,
she'll give me fifty.

02:53.933 --> 02:56.265
And she would do this
for your friend as well?

02:56.332 --> 02:57.667
Yes, everybody.

02:57.734 --> 02:59.500
[Judge Judy] And what do you do
with them, Ms. Weems?

02:59.567 --> 03:01.633
- [chuckles] I, um--
- [Judge Judy] Just--Okay.

03:01.699 --> 03:03.500
I actually--I buy food,

03:03.567 --> 03:04.933
I give them away,

03:05.000 --> 03:06.633
I'm just a person that helps
everybody.

03:06.699 --> 03:08.500
I just buy them because
they would need the money,

03:08.567 --> 03:11.199
so I buy a lot of food,
I have a surplus of food in my--

03:11.265 --> 03:12.467
I didn't know she was giving them away.

03:12.532 --> 03:13.500
[Judge Judy] Shush.

03:13.866 --> 03:15.332
Doesn't matter what I do with them.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.366
[Judge Judy] No, I just would
like to know how it works.

03:18.432 --> 03:20.165
- [Javala] Right.
- So if you have a hundred dollars

03:20.233 --> 03:21.533
worth of food stamps,

03:21.599 --> 03:22.834
she'll give you fifty dollars for
it?

03:23.000 --> 03:23.933
[Katrina] Uh-hmm.

03:24.099 --> 03:26.432
Or two hundred, she'll give me
a hundred, you know.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.966
[Judge Judy] So it's, it's cut in
half.

03:28.066 --> 03:29.332
- It's--it--half, yeah.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.633
And you save them,
give them away, or sell them?

03:32.699 --> 03:34.366
No, I never sell them.

03:34.432 --> 03:36.667
Where do you get the money to buy
them?

03:36.734 --> 03:40.900
Well, I make about 15,000 a month,
I own a tax office as well as a

03:40.966 --> 03:41.966
daycare.
- You have a daycare?

03:42.033 --> 03:43.734
[Katrina] I own daycare and,
and a tax office.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.533
- [Judge Judy] And a what?
- A tax office.

03:45.599 --> 03:47.966
[Judge Judy] Okay. In the daycare,
which is where she said

03:48.033 --> 03:50.667
she met you through a cousin or
something?

03:50.734 --> 03:52.233
I would actually--
I could better explain it.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.866
[Judge Judy] How many children
do you take care of in the daycare?

03:54.933 --> 03:56.000
About 16.

03:56.066 --> 03:58.000
- How old?
- [Katrina] From about six weeks

03:58.066 --> 04:01.000
to sixteen years of age
with special needs.

04:01.066 --> 04:03.265
[Judge Judy] And is the tax office
in the same building?

04:03.332 --> 04:04.734
- [Katrina] No.
- [Judge Judy] Where is that?

04:04.800 --> 04:05.900
It's in a different location.

04:05.967 --> 04:07.900
[Judge Judy] And who is in that
location?

04:07.967 --> 04:10.500
I actually own a salon as well.

04:10.567 --> 04:14.332
So my cousin who's a licensed
stylist, she actually does hair

04:15.500 --> 04:17.567
there.
I own a lot of things. I'm sorry.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.399
I just wanna know who's in the tax
office.

04:19.466 --> 04:20.600
[Katrina] Oh, me.

04:20.667 --> 04:22.399
[Judge Judy] And who's in the
daycare?

04:22.466 --> 04:24.033
Uh, my employees.

04:24.100 --> 04:26.367
As well as myself
depending on the time of day.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.533
Well, tax season is over now, but
yeah.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.300
[Judge Judy]
This is what the case is about.

04:30.367 --> 04:34.632
You say you bought
a car from her for $2,800.

04:34.699 --> 04:36.132
- 38.
- [Judge Judy] 38.

04:36.199 --> 04:37.800
How much did you give her?

04:37.867 --> 04:40.500
[Javala] I gave her 2,800
through Cash App.

04:40.567 --> 04:42.100
If you don't know Cash App,
it's a app where...

04:42.165 --> 04:44.199
[Judge Judy] No. Just a second
there's an app, I don't--

04:44.266 --> 04:45.332
- [Javala] Yeah.
- Don't try to explain it to me.

04:45.399 --> 04:47.132
I'm very, very stupid.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.533
- So...
- [Javala] Okay.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.632
And then I gave her a thousand in
cash.

04:50.699 --> 04:52.766
I was gonna give it all to her in
cash,

04:52.834 --> 04:55.000
but because I have Chime.

04:55.066 --> 04:57.600
My bank with Chime,
I don't bank with a actual bank,

04:57.667 --> 04:59.567
I wasn't able to get a money order
out.

05:00.132 --> 05:02.533
So I asked Ms. Weems,
was it okay for me to give her

05:02.600 --> 05:05.432
a thousand dollars in cash
since I already got the thousand

05:05.500 --> 05:09.033
out the ATM.
and if I can Cash App her the rest.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.733
She agreed to doing that, but--

05:10.800 --> 05:12.100
[Judge Judy] Uh, just a second.

05:12.165 --> 05:14.533
Did she give you $3,800 for the
car?

05:14.699 --> 05:15.632
No, ma'am.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.100
[Judge Judy] How much did
she give you for the car?

05:17.165 --> 05:18.867
She gave me $2,800.

05:18.934 --> 05:21.033
[Javala] Is this when I pull out
evidence?

05:21.100 --> 05:22.332
[Judge Judy] I'm going
to see your evidence.

05:22.399 --> 05:23.733
- [Javala] Okay.
- [Judge Judy] This took place

05:23.800 --> 05:26.065
in April of 2020?

05:26.132 --> 05:27.699
- Uh-hmm.
- [Judge Judy] April what?

05:27.766 --> 05:29.233
April 21st.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.399
- [Judge Judy] Uh, was it April 21st?
- [Javala] Uh-hmm.

05:30.466 --> 05:32.466
I'm actually talking to you.
Uh-huh is not an answer.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.766
- Yes is an answer.
- Yes. Yes, yes.

05:34.834 --> 05:38.567
I'd like you to show me proof
that you gave her $3,800.

05:38.632 --> 05:40.432
She says you only gave her 28.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.766
- Oh, no, no. I'll take care of it.
- [Javala] Oh, I'm sorry.

05:44.834 --> 05:46.300
Okay. That's the 28

05:46.367 --> 05:49.533
and then, um, I have
the screenshot in my phone

05:49.600 --> 05:51.466
for the thousand dollars.

05:52.466 --> 05:55.332
I took off 500 cause you can't
take off the whole thousand,

05:55.399 --> 05:58.399
so I had to take off 500
for the first ATM, transaction.

05:58.466 --> 05:59.766
- [Judge Judy] Just a second. Just--
- And then--

05:59.834 --> 06:02.899
--and what month and date?

06:02.966 --> 06:04.300
[Javala] This was April.

06:04.367 --> 06:06.199
- April what?
- [Javala] 21st, yes.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.733
[Judge Judy] April 21st.

06:07.800 --> 06:08.800
- Yes.
- [Judge Judy] This is for how much?

06:08.867 --> 06:10.500
I just wanna be able to look.

06:19.567 --> 06:21.600
Who's Pretty Lagirl?

06:21.667 --> 06:22.667
- [Javala] That's her.
- I'm Pretty.

06:22.733 --> 06:23.934
- [Judge Judy] That would be you?
- Yes.

06:24.000 --> 06:24.899
[Javala] Right here.

06:24.966 --> 06:27.332
That's how much I got back
after she did my taxes

06:27.399 --> 06:28.966
and those were the two transactions

06:29.033 --> 06:31.600
that I had made,
and it shows the date up there.

06:32.667 --> 06:33.632
Okay.

06:35.165 --> 06:38.000
Okay. ATM withdrawal, 500.

06:38.066 --> 06:40.367
ATM withdrawal 500.

06:40.432 --> 06:43.966
Transfer from Credit Builder.
What's Credit Builder?

06:44.033 --> 06:46.800
Credit Builder is-- um, because I'm
trying to build my credit,

06:46.867 --> 06:49.800
it's another account
that's connected to my Chime.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.766
So it just--instead of it going
to my spending account,

06:52.834 --> 06:54.233
it's go to my credit account

06:54.300 --> 06:55.367
- and I can transfer it.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

06:55.432 --> 06:59.066
So the tax refund was processed

06:59.132 --> 07:02.199
- at 11:37 in the morning.
- [Javala] Uh-hmm.

07:02.266 --> 07:03.567
I called her right away.

07:03.632 --> 07:09.000
[Judge Judy] And that was $4,823.63.

07:09.065 --> 07:13.300
On that same day at 1:48 and 1:44

07:13.367 --> 07:16.466
and this is on Tuesday, the 20th,

07:16.533 --> 07:18.733
she took out a thousand dollars.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.132
I wouldn't know what she took out
the bank, ma'am, I don't know.

07:21.199 --> 07:22.399
- [Judge Judy] Hmm?
- [Katrina] She didn't give it to me.

07:22.466 --> 07:24.466
I don't know what she--I can't vouch
for what she took out the bank,

07:24.533 --> 07:25.432
ma'am.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.966
[Javala] I have
a screenshot of her saying,

07:27.033 --> 07:29.132
"You gave him thirty-eight hundred,

07:29.199 --> 07:30.533
he gave me a hundred dollars

07:30.600 --> 07:33.800
for the tires, so now,
you only pay thirty-seven."

07:33.867 --> 07:35.432
- [Judge Judy] Could I see that?
- Yes, ma'am.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.399
[Judge Judy] May I see that, please?

07:36.466 --> 07:37.432
- [Javala] Yes, ma'am.
- [Katrina] That is reflecting...

07:37.500 --> 07:38.600
Don't speak.

07:41.933 --> 07:43.899
I asked you question.

07:43.966 --> 07:45.966
- The question was a simple one.
- What's...

07:46.033 --> 07:47.899
[Judge Judy] I said,
"What is the location,

07:47.966 --> 07:49.432
- the current location of..."
- [Katrina] I'm not aware.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.132
[Judge Judy] "...the 2005 Toyota
Camry?"

07:52.199 --> 07:53.332
I don't know.

07:58.399 --> 08:02.000
[tense music playing]

08:04.966 --> 08:08.533
[Announcer] Javala Elam claims
business owner Katrina Weems

08:08.600 --> 08:11.000
wrongfully repossessed her car

08:11.065 --> 08:13.500
and all the belongings left inside.

08:13.567 --> 08:14.966
[Judge Judy] While she's looking for
that,

08:15.033 --> 08:17.165
tell me the location, Ms. Weems,

08:17.233 --> 08:20.266
of the 2005 Toyota Camry.

08:20.332 --> 08:21.367
I sold it.

08:21.432 --> 08:22.766
[Judge Judy] To whom?

08:22.834 --> 08:23.766
A young man.

08:23.834 --> 08:25.199
Tell me when you sold it.

08:25.266 --> 08:28.500
[Katrina] I sold it, I believe
it was--I'd say June 27th.

08:28.567 --> 08:30.899
Basically, what took place is,

08:30.966 --> 08:34.165
I sold the car-- um, actually, I
didn't sell it to her.

08:34.232 --> 08:35.533
She wanted to purchase the car.

08:35.600 --> 08:36.966
- I wanna give you a accurate--
- No.

08:37.033 --> 08:38.332
I asked you question.

08:38.399 --> 08:40.567
- The question was a simple one.
- What's...

08:40.633 --> 08:42.633
[Judge Judy] I said,
"What is the location,

08:42.700 --> 08:44.399
- the current location..."
- I'm not aware.

08:44.466 --> 08:46.667
[Judge Judy]
"...of the 2005 Toyota Camry?"

08:46.734 --> 08:47.700
I don't know.

08:47.767 --> 08:48.734
[Judge Judy] So you say, "I sold it."

08:48.799 --> 08:49.667
I sold it.

08:49.734 --> 08:52.200
[Judge Judy] Put your hand down.
I said, "To whom?"

08:52.265 --> 08:54.165
- You said a young man.
- [Katrina] Uh-hmm.

08:54.232 --> 08:56.200
That's where we're at, not a whole
story.

08:56.265 --> 08:59.299
Did you sell it
after putting an ad someplace?

08:59.366 --> 09:01.232
No, I just put a for sale sign on
the car.

09:01.299 --> 09:03.899
Okay. And the car
was registered in your name?

09:03.966 --> 09:06.332
No, it's registered in my fiance's
name.

09:06.399 --> 09:09.332
Okay. And your fiance's name is what?

09:09.399 --> 09:11.133
- Jackson.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

09:11.200 --> 09:15.066
Now, Mr. Jackson had to have signed
the title over to this young man?

09:15.133 --> 09:17.232
No, to this young lady, no, he
didn't.

09:17.299 --> 09:19.432
- [Judge Judy] No. To the young man.
- [Katrina] Oh, yeah, he did.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.866
- Pay attention.
- Yes, yes, yes. The--

09:20.933 --> 09:22.432
- [Judge Judy] To the young man--
- Yes, he did.

09:22.500 --> 09:26.265
[Judge Judy] In order for the young
man to put the car in his name.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.466
And that you did in June?

09:28.533 --> 09:31.633
[Katrina] It was two days
after I retrieved the car.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.734
[Judge Judy] In what month
did you retrieve?

09:33.799 --> 09:37.466
It was about June 27th or 28th,
give or take a day.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.767
Were you there
when this transaction took place?

09:39.834 --> 09:40.767
Yes.

09:40.834 --> 09:41.966
[Judge Judy] Of the sale of
the car?

09:42.033 --> 09:43.966
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, don't say it is yeah.

09:44.033 --> 09:46.165
You said it wasn't your car,
it's your boyfriend's car

09:46.232 --> 09:49.432
cause it was in his name. So it's a
logical question. Were you--

09:49.500 --> 09:52.033
- It was my car. Actually--
- It can't be your car

09:52.100 --> 09:55.432
if it's not registered in your name,
if the title is not in your name.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.533
The car is registered
in Jackson's name.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.033
- [Judge Judy] Well--
- I cannot tell you, yeah.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.166
- What?
- [Katrina] It's all true.

10:02.232 --> 10:04.200
The car is registered
under Jackson's name.

10:04.265 --> 10:06.600
I gave him the cash for the car.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.466
- I paid for the car. So--
- [Judge Judy] I don't care

10:08.533 --> 10:10.899
whether you paid for it or not,
I don't care what that was from.

10:10.966 --> 10:14.232
If the car is titled in his name
and registered in his name,

10:14.299 --> 10:15.767
- it's his car.
- Yes.

10:15.833 --> 10:18.600
[Judge Judy] So he had to be there
in order to sign the title.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.466
- He did sign the title.
- [Judge Judy] Great.

10:20.533 --> 10:21.767
And he signed the title

10:21.833 --> 10:25.399
sometime in June of this year.

10:25.466 --> 10:26.866
- Correct. Correct.
- [Judge Judy] Right.

10:26.933 --> 10:28.600
- Is he here with you today?
- [Katrina] No, he's not.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.166
What's his telephone number?

10:30.232 --> 10:32.232
He doesn't wanna be--I'm actually
his POA.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.533
I want his phone number.

10:35.933 --> 10:37.165
414...

10:38.799 --> 10:40.834
[Judge Judy] Let's get this right.
I'm gonna call this number.

10:40.899 --> 10:43.600
Is there going to be a recording
or is there gonna be a person,

10:43.667 --> 10:46.100
- or is it wrong number?
- No, it's his phone number.

10:46.165 --> 10:48.299
- [Judge Judy] It's a Mr. Jackson.
- It's his phone number.

10:48.366 --> 10:50.667
[Judge Judy] Okay.
And just so that we're clear,

10:50.734 --> 10:52.700
Mr. Jackson is going to tell me

10:52.767 --> 10:56.000
that he sold by signing over the
title

10:56.066 --> 10:58.366
to a young man
whose name you don't know.

10:58.432 --> 10:59.933
I never said I didn't know the name.

11:00.066 --> 11:02.633
- [Judge Judy] Well, what's his name?
- I'm not gonna give his name.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.700
You have to give his name.
This is not a secret.

11:04.767 --> 11:06.667
- [Javala] I can. Can I, Judge?
- Sure.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.799
[Javala] His name is--um, he go by
Trey.

11:08.866 --> 11:11.033
He is a friend of my, um, cousin.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.899
I've seen him the day before I was
actually supposed to board the plane.

11:14.966 --> 11:18.600
I'd seen him at the gas station
on Teutonia and Florist,

11:18.667 --> 11:21.166
- um, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
- [Judge Judy] Just a second.

11:21.232 --> 11:22.399
Was he driving this car?

11:22.466 --> 11:23.833
[Javala]
Yes, he was. He was actually--

11:23.899 --> 11:26.633
his friend--he got his friend driving
it. But he was in the passenger side.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.866
- [Judge Judy] Did you talk to him?
- Yes, I did.

11:28.933 --> 11:31.000
Did he confirm
that he had purchased the car?

11:31.066 --> 11:32.834
- Yes, he did.
- [Judge Judy] I'd like to see

11:32.899 --> 11:36.232
her text to you about this $3,800

11:36.299 --> 11:38.533
minus $100 for the tires.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.066
Tell one lie, you got to keep up
with the other ones

11:45.066 --> 11:46.933
Okay. So you say to her,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.165
"I just told him everything."

11:49.232 --> 11:50.633
I assume that's Mr. Jackson.

11:50.700 --> 11:51.734
Uh-hmm.

11:51.799 --> 11:54.834
[Judge Judy] And he said that,
"He's gonna cover those tires

11:54.899 --> 11:56.899
because he didn't want
to sell it that way.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.466
So he just gave me a hundred.

11:59.533 --> 12:01.866
So you just owe me $300.

12:01.933 --> 12:04.000
So now you paid $37."

12:04.066 --> 12:05.833
- [Javala] Uh-hmm.
- That's 300 every two weeks.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.533
- She knows the agreement.
- [Javala] No.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.667
[Judge Judy] So now you paid 37.

12:09.734 --> 12:11.833
That'll be the total amount
that she'll be paying

12:11.899 --> 12:13.899
for the car once
she completely paid me off, ma'am.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.567
- Well, that's not what it says.
- Thank you.

12:15.633 --> 12:17.700
It's quick and straight to the point.
We had a verbal conversation--

12:17.767 --> 12:19.299
[Judge Judy] Just a second.

12:19.366 --> 12:22.200
This looks like I have you $3,800.

12:22.265 --> 12:24.734
- So you mean I gave you $3,800--
- [Javala] Yeah. Yeah.

12:24.799 --> 12:28.299
[Judge Judy] --for a whole car
that wasn't even worth it.

12:28.366 --> 12:30.366
I was doing you a favor,

12:30.432 --> 12:33.165
cause you did me one.

12:33.232 --> 12:36.432
[Javala] Meaning that I gave her
$3,800 for a car

12:36.500 --> 12:38.500
because like I said Katrina
was helping me out.

12:38.567 --> 12:40.600
- [Judge Judy] Okay.
- It was a 2005.

12:40.667 --> 12:43.966
Um, I could have got something better
for $3,800, but because--

12:44.033 --> 12:47.000
No, you couldn't. No, you couldn't.

12:47.066 --> 12:48.200
- I mean, I could've if I would've
went--

12:48.265 --> 12:49.200
[Judge Judy] No.

12:49.299 --> 12:51.600
[Javala] --to somewhere
more better than going to her.

12:51.667 --> 12:54.767
I could've paid a car loan
instead of going to her paying--

12:54.834 --> 12:56.366
- why would I pay her a car note--
- [Judge Judy] I don't wanna hear--

12:56.432 --> 12:59.100
--when I can pay
an actual car note a car note.

12:59.165 --> 13:01.500
- [Judge Judy] Well, if that's--
- Especially if they come repossess

13:01.567 --> 13:05.066
my stuff and leave and take
everything in my trunk that I had.

13:05.133 --> 13:07.399
She didn't give me
any of my things back.

13:07.466 --> 13:09.432
[Judge Judy] Thank you.
And then she responded to you.

13:09.500 --> 13:13.500
"Honey, you bought the car from him
so that money didn't go to me.

13:13.567 --> 13:17.200
And that was a power
steering pump that you got fixed.

13:17.265 --> 13:19.366
So in other words,
you're saying you're not

13:19.432 --> 13:21.100
gonna give me the money
you owe me?"

13:21.166 --> 13:24.667
And you respond,
"Of course I am not like that."

13:24.734 --> 13:28.332
And she wrote, "I actually like
your,"

13:28.399 --> 13:29.899
- and then I don't see the rest.
- Yeah, I have the rest of that.

13:29.966 --> 13:32.834
That was me saying
I actually like you

13:32.899 --> 13:35.466
so I'm not gonna take it personal
that you're being disrespectful

13:35.533 --> 13:37.165
because you've never
disrespected me before.

13:37.232 --> 13:38.332
I still have all the messages.

13:40.899 --> 13:43.299
- The car belonged to Mr. Jackson.
- Exactly. And it still his.

13:43.366 --> 13:45.066
[Judge Judy]
Whether you bought him a gift,

13:45.133 --> 13:48.100
whether it was a birthday present,
whether it was a Hanukkah present,

13:48.165 --> 13:50.834
I don't know. I don't know.

13:50.899 --> 13:53.366
But, it was his car.

13:53.432 --> 13:55.165
And you say it was his car.

14:07.299 --> 14:10.500
[announcer] Javala Elam
has accused business owner

14:10.567 --> 14:13.466
Katrina Weems of repossessing her car

14:13.533 --> 14:15.700
and stealing the items inside.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.232
[Judge Judy] Let us assume, for--

14:18.299 --> 14:20.200
just the sake of argument here

14:20.265 --> 14:23.567
that I believe you
that she only gave you $2,800

14:23.633 --> 14:25.133
and you repossessed the car

14:25.200 --> 14:27.567
cause we acknowledge
that you repossessed the car.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.466
And you say you were there

14:29.533 --> 14:33.667
when Mr. Jackson sold the car

14:33.734 --> 14:37.033
- Uh-hmm.
- How much did he get for the car?

14:37.100 --> 14:38.432
$900.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.466
- 900?
- [Katrina] That was all I wanted.

14:40.533 --> 14:42.066
Because I wanted my money back.
It--It wasn't no--

14:42.133 --> 14:43.600
[Judge Judy]
Just a second. Just a second.

14:43.667 --> 14:46.834
Well, that's ridiculous.
I can't believe that because--

14:46.899 --> 14:49.500
- [Katrina] It's the truth.
- --the book value of this car is?

14:49.567 --> 14:52.700
- [Sarah] Between 2,800 and 4,300.
- [Katrina] Yeah.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.600
But I had already got 2,800.
I--I make a lot of money, Judge.

14:55.667 --> 14:57.066
- [Judge Judy] Just a second.
- Go ahead.

14:57.133 --> 14:59.000
[Judge Judy]
So you had already--just a second.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.567
So you had already gotten
28 from her.

15:01.633 --> 15:02.533
[Katrina] Uh-hmm.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.866
[Judge Judy] And all you wanted
was nine, because?

15:05.933 --> 15:07.232
That was all I needed left.

15:07.299 --> 15:09.633
That would've
completed me getting to $3,800.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.700
- He gave her 2,500 for that car.
- No, he didn't. I--no, he didn't.

15:12.767 --> 15:14.100
[Javala] He met her at [indistinct]

15:18.633 --> 15:19.767
No he didn't.

15:19.833 --> 15:21.899
Judge Judy, I have his number on
standby I can call him right now.

15:21.966 --> 15:24.567
[Katrina] And also just to enlighten
you guys,

15:24.633 --> 15:26.200
that's actually my little cousin.

15:26.265 --> 15:29.734
We just didn't let her know that.
It's my cousin. And he did it, it--

15:29.799 --> 15:32.100
Why didn't you answer
that to me? You say--

15:32.165 --> 15:33.265
- She doesn't know that.
- [Judge Judy] No. No.

15:33.332 --> 15:34.899
Why didn't you say that to me?

15:34.966 --> 15:37.667
Because I wasn't trying
to make her aware of that as of yet.

15:37.734 --> 15:40.366
[Judge Judy] Okay.
How long did you drive the car?

15:40.432 --> 15:43.265
- I drove the car till June 27th.
- [Judge Judy] And when did you buy

15:43.332 --> 15:45.066
- it?
- I bought it April 21st.

15:45.133 --> 15:46.799
[Judge Judy] You drove it some of
April,

15:46.866 --> 15:48.432
some of May, right?

15:48.500 --> 15:49.966
- All of May.
- [Judge Judy] All of May.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.533
- [Javala] Yeah.
- [Judge Judy] Until June?

15:51.600 --> 15:53.834
- 27th.
- [Judge Judy] 27th. And June.

15:54.799 --> 15:58.332
I'm not actually
a hundred percent satisfied

15:58.399 --> 16:00.133
with all of the math here.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.200
- Math is not my strong suit.
- It's mine.

16:02.265 --> 16:05.200
[Judge Judy] But I know
one thing for certain

16:05.265 --> 16:07.466
that you gave her 28--

16:07.533 --> 16:10.767
- at least $2,800 for this car.
- Uh-hmm.

16:10.833 --> 16:13.966
[Judge Judy] And you drove it
for at least two and a half months?

16:14.033 --> 16:15.933
- [Javala] Yes.
- [Judge Judy] Right. So--

16:16.000 --> 16:17.399
[Javala] I actually paid 38.

16:17.466 --> 16:19.700
But if you don't count
the thousand dollar transaction

16:19.767 --> 16:21.633
as a part of that,

16:21.700 --> 16:24.633
then I understand,
but I actually paid $3,804.

16:24.700 --> 16:25.966
[Judge Judy] Okay.

16:26.033 --> 16:27.833
What I'm telling you is you drove
the car.

16:27.899 --> 16:31.633
She says that she
only received $2,800 from you.

16:31.700 --> 16:35.165
You tell me
that you paid $3,800 for the car.

16:35.232 --> 16:38.500
She sold the car again
or gave it away to her little cousin.

16:38.567 --> 16:39.799
I don't believe her.

16:39.866 --> 16:43.399
I don't think that she's the sweet
little lady that she says she is.

16:43.466 --> 16:45.232
I think that she makes money.

16:45.299 --> 16:47.366
And she makes money from lots of
sources,

16:47.432 --> 16:50.533
which is very good and resourceful
of her.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.133
On the low end, it's worth $2,500.

16:53.200 --> 16:56.165
So why would she give her
little cousin this car for $900

16:56.232 --> 16:58.033
because all she wants was her money
back?

16:58.100 --> 17:00.700
What happened to Mr. Jackson?
It's Mr. Jackson's car.

17:00.767 --> 17:02.767
And she says here.

17:03.533 --> 17:05.333
If my memory is correct,

17:05.400 --> 17:07.599
"Honey, you bought the car from him"

17:07.666 --> 17:09.633
- Yeah, we have six cars.
- [Judge Judy] Nope. Just a second.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.299
- You bought the car from them?
- Let me elaborate on it.

17:11.366 --> 17:13.333
[Judge Judy] So that--you say,

17:13.400 --> 17:14.933
"Honey," referring to her.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.232
"You bought the car from him.

17:17.299 --> 17:19.165
So that money didn't go to me"

17:19.232 --> 17:21.633
- That's what you say.
- [Javala] Not you only pay 2,800.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.366
- [Judge Judy] Shush!
- Okay.

17:23.432 --> 17:25.165
I completely paid for that car.

17:25.232 --> 17:27.266
It needs all the tape measures.
It was our paper.

17:27.333 --> 17:29.834
[Judge Judy] I don't--listen-- I
don't care whether you actually paid

17:29.900 --> 17:31.333
for the car or not.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.967
- The car belonged to Mr. Jackson.
- Exactly. And it still his.

17:34.032 --> 17:37.500
[Judge Judy] Whether you bought him
a gift, whether it was a birthday

17:37.567 --> 17:39.834
present, whether it was a Hanukkah
present, I don't know.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.700
I don't know.

17:41.767 --> 17:44.032
But it was his car.

17:44.099 --> 17:45.834
And you say it was his car.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.366
- [Javala] Uh-hmm.
- [Katrina] That's why she picked up

17:47.432 --> 17:50.066
one of his cars. If I--I would need
to elaborate on everything cause

17:50.133 --> 17:52.232
- I am very detailed, Your Honor.
- No I don't want to elaborate on it.

17:52.299 --> 17:53.933
- I'm done with this case.
- [Katrina] Oh, okay.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.532
You drove the car for two months
make-believe you rented it for two

17:57.599 --> 18:00.232
months. Judgment for the plaintiff
in the amount of $2,800

18:00.299 --> 18:02.333
because she doesn't have it anymore.
We're done. We're done!

18:02.400 --> 18:04.066
- But Judge, I also--no, I--
- [Kevin] Court is adjourned.

18:04.133 --> 18:06.400
- [Judge Judy] We're done.
- [Javala] But what--

18:06.467 --> 18:08.900
- [Kevin] It's over. It's over. - ...
the stuff that was left in the car?

18:08.967 --> 18:11.366
I had things that was up--
my daughter things was up

18:11.432 --> 18:13.366
in that car when she repossessed
my car.

18:13.432 --> 18:15.933
- I don't get that back? Everything.
- [Kevin] Wait, wait, wait, hold up.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.165
- Just a second.
- [Kevin] Hold up.

18:17.232 --> 18:20.467
Did you ask Trey when you met him

18:20.532 --> 18:22.633
if there was anything
in the car when she bought it?

18:22.700 --> 18:24.133
Sh--She took it all out.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.666
She cleared it out,
everything that I had up in that car.

18:26.733 --> 18:28.032
She cleared it out.

18:28.099 --> 18:30.232
I want you to consider yourself very
lucky

18:30.299 --> 18:32.066
that you're getting
the money back for this car.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.733
Consider yourself lucky.
You have a counterclaim.

18:35.799 --> 18:37.767
- You say that she harassed you.
- [Katrina] Yes, ma'am.

18:37.834 --> 18:40.400
Actually your counterclaim
is for a whole lot of money.

18:40.467 --> 18:43.467
Now, I want you to show me
the worst of the harassment

18:43.532 --> 18:44.967
that she did to you.

18:45.032 --> 18:46.266
Come. Let's go.

18:49.032 --> 18:51.032
- Your Honor.
- [Judge Judy] Hand down.

18:51.967 --> 18:54.266
[Katrina] Uh, the very worst would
be her threatening to shoot my kids.

18:54.333 --> 18:55.767
[Judge Judy] Oh, I'd like to see that.

18:55.834 --> 18:56.866
[Katrina] Right here.

18:58.767 --> 19:00.599
I have documentation of everything.

19:00.666 --> 19:02.366
Okay. Hope.

19:02.432 --> 19:05.032
[Javala] Only because she did this
to me and threatened my child.

19:05.099 --> 19:06.834
- Here you go.
- No, I didn't.

19:08.266 --> 19:11.165
And I have a surplus
of those on multiple occasions.

19:11.232 --> 19:12.633
Nobody can hear you.

19:12.700 --> 19:14.900
[Javala] I have proof
of her doing this to other people.

19:14.967 --> 19:17.500
- [Katrina] Hmm.
- Like this is crazy.

19:17.567 --> 19:21.099
You're just talking nasty to each
other. Can I please see what she has?

19:21.165 --> 19:24.700
Exactly. Just back and forth. That's
all it was, was back and forth.

19:24.767 --> 19:26.500
I don't wanna hear anyth--.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.333
I don't know where you think you are.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.900
I'm at court.

19:30.967 --> 19:32.467
Then behave like it.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.467
I have documentation of everything.

19:35.532 --> 19:37.133
- Can you give this?
- She even a called

19:37.200 --> 19:38.666
Child Protective Services on me,

19:38.733 --> 19:41.099
called the police and the Child--
and the Child Protective Services--

19:41.165 --> 19:43.532
Because you're a bad mom.
You're a bad mom.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.299
- Due to the COVID.
- You had your kids sleeping

19:45.366 --> 19:46.866
in the basement.
You're a bad mom.

19:46.933 --> 19:48.767
[Judge Judy] Put your hands off.
Thank you.

19:48.834 --> 19:50.432
[Katrina] I'm speaking with you,
Judge Sheindlin.

19:51.299 --> 19:53.133
You're not speaking to me.
If she's not taking it down,

19:53.200 --> 19:54.232
you're not speaking to me.

19:56.432 --> 19:59.266
Judgment for the plaintiff
for the amount of $2,800.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.066
The counterclaim is dismissed.
We're done. Thank you.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.200
- [Kevin] Court is adjourned.
- [Javala] It don't matter for me.

20:03.266 --> 20:04.467
Thank you.

20:05.967 --> 20:07.165
No, we were never friends.

20:07.232 --> 20:09.532
I was only buying her food stamps,
her government assistance,

20:09.599 --> 20:11.500
which I will be reporting
to the government as well.

20:11.567 --> 20:13.799
She made her judgment.
It is what it is.

20:13.866 --> 20:16.032
She's mad because she rented a car
from me.

20:16.099 --> 20:18.266
She refused to pay me
the rest of the money.

20:18.333 --> 20:19.733
And I went and took it back.

20:19.799 --> 20:21.567
So at the end of the day, you know,

20:21.633 --> 20:23.799
she got what she got.
She did what she did.

20:23.866 --> 20:25.866
Oh, actually, I don't care.
It's a learning experience for her.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.599
- I'm still up.
- And it's okay. She lost.

20:29.633 --> 20:31.967
[Sarah] I wonder if both
those women realize

20:32.032 --> 20:35.200
that they just admitted
in court to committing a felony.

20:35.266 --> 20:38.799
When I heard that they were
exchanging food stamps for money,

20:38.866 --> 20:42.834
for cash, for other things
I looked up the Wisconsin Statute.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.866
And sure enough, if you transfer

20:44.933 --> 20:47.700
or sell for money,
something other than food,

20:47.767 --> 20:49.967
that's a class one felony.

20:50.032 --> 20:51.900
[Judge Judy] It sounded like a scam.

20:51.967 --> 20:54.232
Irrespective of the fact
that the defendant says,

20:54.299 --> 20:57.733
I give it away, I use it,
you know, but I pay for it.

20:57.799 --> 21:00.200
I don't know some programs
that are meant

21:00.266 --> 21:01.933
to really help people.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.133
And it's just too bad
that some people will always stoop

21:05.200 --> 21:08.266
to the level of abusing a program

21:08.333 --> 21:11.032
that was really meant to help people

21:11.099 --> 21:14.532
who really couldn't afford to buy
food, people who are going hungry.

21:14.599 --> 21:17.933
In this short time
that we have been doing these cases,

21:19.333 --> 21:21.366
half a dozen examples of people

21:21.432 --> 21:24.532
- who knowingly abuse the system.
- [Sarah] Uh-hmm.

21:24.599 --> 21:26.866
And the system
isn't capable of protecting itself.

21:26.933 --> 21:28.467
- It's very frightening.
- [Sarah] Yeah.

21:28.532 --> 21:31.000
- Thanks for the info.
- No problem.

21:32.767 --> 21:36.099
