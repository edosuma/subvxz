01:16.693 --> 01:19.696
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:19.696 --> 01:22.699
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:23.199 --> 01:27.954
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:27.954 --> 01:30.740
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:30.740 --> 01:36.246
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:36.246 --> 01:40.750
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:40.750 --> 01:43.253
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:43.253 --> 01:45.755

maggot-sucking,
vermin-infested stinkweeds!

02:26.696 --> 02:30.533
Practicing for that Mother of
the Year speech again, Carla?

02:31.034 --> 02:33.536
Shut up!

02:33.536 --> 02:35.038
What seems to be the problem?

02:35.038 --> 02:37.040
I've been planning my Elvis pilgrimage

02:37.040 --> 02:39.542
to Memphis for weeks, and
now Nick is backing out

02:39.542 --> 02:41.544
of taking care of the kids.

02:41.544 --> 02:43.046
He says his appendix burst.

02:43.046 --> 02:44.848
Well, that seems serious to me.

02:44.848 --> 02:48.384
His appendix bursts
every time I need a favor.

02:48.384 --> 02:52.105
Boy, if he was smart,
he'd have that removed.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.808
Hello, one and all.

02:55.808 --> 02:57.060
Hello.

02:57.060 --> 02:59.062
How are you, love of my life? Just fine,

02:59.062 --> 03:00.446
pain in my neck.

03:02.899 --> 03:05.401
The most exciting thing has happened.

03:05.401 --> 03:06.402
You'll never guess.

03:06.402 --> 03:08.655
I got a letter

03:08.655 --> 03:09.956
from Syzygy.

03:09.956 --> 03:13.710
Stop it! Yeah!

03:15.044 --> 03:17.547
All right, all right, who's Syzygy?

03:17.547 --> 03:21.050
It's not a who-- it's
a new literary review,

03:21.050 --> 03:24.053
dedicated to publishing
the prose and poetry

03:24.053 --> 03:26.556
that's right on the cutting edge.

03:26.556 --> 03:28.558
Well, I, for one, am
excited for you, Diane.

03:28.558 --> 03:30.310
Ah, there, it passed.

03:31.978 --> 03:33.813
Oh... let-let me have a look at it.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.181
What does the letter say?

03:35.181 --> 03:37.650
Well, I submitted one of my poems

03:37.650 --> 03:40.653
for publication, and quite honestly,

03:40.653 --> 03:42.655
I was overwhelmed by the response.

03:42.655 --> 03:45.408
It was more than I could
ever have hoped for.

03:45.408 --> 03:47.744
But I blush. Read it.

03:47.744 --> 03:49.245
It speaks for itself.

03:49.245 --> 03:50.747
(giggles)

03:50.747 --> 03:53.249
Oh, uh...

03:53.249 --> 03:55.251
this is a rejection letter.

03:55.251 --> 03:57.253
It's not a rejection letter per se.

03:57.754 --> 04:02.258
It's a "soon and inevitably
to be accepted" letter.

04:02.258 --> 04:04.127
Listen to this.

04:04.127 --> 04:07.597
"Your work is not
entirely without promise."

04:07.597 --> 04:10.099
They're almost begging
for another submission.

04:11.601 --> 04:12.852
Boy, you know, I...

04:12.852 --> 04:16.139
I hope you don't get your
hopes up there too high,

04:16.139 --> 04:19.142
because that looks like
a form letter to me.

04:19.142 --> 04:21.527
Poor Sam.

04:21.527 --> 04:23.279
This really threatens you, doesn't it?

04:23.780 --> 04:25.281
Let me assure you that I can heed

04:25.281 --> 04:27.784
my man as well as my muse.

04:27.784 --> 04:30.787
Syzygy would not even have
bothered to respond to my letter

04:31.287 --> 04:35.792
if they hadn't perceived me as
an up-and-coming literary talent.

04:35.792 --> 04:37.293
You know, this is just like you.

04:37.794 --> 04:40.163
You-you turn every
defeat into a victory.

04:40.163 --> 04:41.464
It's like the time when I said

04:41.464 --> 04:42.966
that I didn't want to see you anymore,

04:42.966 --> 04:44.968
and you all of a sudden
start making wedding plans.

04:44.968 --> 04:47.720
Sam, we can talk about the
wedding later-- I have work to do.

04:49.806 --> 04:53.893
You know, I bet I could, uh,
send a poem to that magazine

04:53.893 --> 04:56.179
and get the same letter
back that you did.

04:56.179 --> 04:59.182
Oh, Sam, you don't want to write a poem.

04:59.182 --> 05:02.185
Poetry is very, very difficult.

05:02.185 --> 05:05.071
What's the big deal? All
you got to do is rhyme.

05:05.071 --> 05:08.741
Most great modern poetry

05:08.741 --> 05:10.526
doesn't necessarily have to rhyme.

05:10.526 --> 05:12.028
Well, that's even easier, isn't it?

05:14.197 --> 05:17.533
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

05:17.533 --> 05:20.920
Go ahead, write your little poem.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.756
You don't think I can
even write a stupid poem.

05:23.756 --> 05:25.258
Of course you can.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.627
Don't forget to capitalize
the first letter.

05:28.544 --> 05:30.546
I'm gonna do this.

05:30.546 --> 05:34.050
I'm gonna show you that I can
be as much of a reject as you.

05:34.050 --> 05:37.437
I told you, I was not rejected.

05:37.437 --> 05:39.138
Whatever. Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:39.138 --> 05:42.475
I have a little creating to do.

05:50.733 --> 05:52.785
Coffee...

05:52.785 --> 05:56.572
(quietly): Any of you guys
know how to write poetry?

05:56.572 --> 05:59.075
Uh, I know how to make fun of 'em.

05:59.075 --> 06:00.576
No.

06:05.882 --> 06:08.668
Great, Nick. That's wonderful.

06:08.668 --> 06:13.639
You're not as much of a scum
bucket as I thought you were.

06:13.639 --> 06:16.392
No, that's not an
attempt at reconciliation.

06:16.392 --> 06:19.228
Hey, Nick's gonna take care of the kids.

06:19.228 --> 06:20.730
Graceland, here I come.

06:20.730 --> 06:22.231
Hey, all right. Hey, all right.

06:22.231 --> 06:24.100
Didn't you go to Graceland last year?

06:24.100 --> 06:26.436
Yeah, but this is special--
I mean, how many times

06:26.436 --> 06:28.938
does the tenth anniversary
of Elvis's death roll around?

06:28.938 --> 06:32.325
Don't ask me. I wasn't a fan.

06:36.579 --> 06:38.581
Hi, Sam.

06:38.581 --> 06:40.583
Hello.

06:40.583 --> 06:43.586
Sam, have you received
that rejection letter

06:43.586 --> 06:45.088
for your poem yet?

06:45.088 --> 06:47.423
No, I haven't.

06:47.423 --> 06:49.292
Hmm.

06:49.292 --> 06:53.179
The letter I received
arrived within two weeks

06:53.179 --> 06:54.931
of my submission, and here it is,

06:54.931 --> 06:57.600
three weeks, and nothing for you.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.969
Isn't that odd?

06:59.969 --> 07:01.971
Odd.

07:01.971 --> 07:03.973
What's this?

07:03.973 --> 07:06.776
It's that magazine you
couldn't get your poetry into.

07:09.695 --> 07:11.197
Thank you, Woody.

07:11.197 --> 07:14.150
I mean, what is it doing here?

07:14.150 --> 07:16.652
Well, I decided if
I'm gonna try to write,

07:17.153 --> 07:19.655
I might as well read
some of that poetry stuff.

07:19.655 --> 07:22.658
Sam, that's very commendable.

07:22.658 --> 07:24.160
I didn't realize

07:24.160 --> 07:26.662
the new issue was out.
Yeah, it's not bad, either.

07:26.662 --> 07:28.414
They got one I really like.

07:28.414 --> 07:30.750
Page 37, I believe.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.752
Yeah, read it out loud.

07:32.752 --> 07:34.754
It'd be good for me to hear.

07:34.754 --> 07:35.755
All right.

07:36.255 --> 07:39.142
"Nocturne" by Sam Mal... oh!

07:49.202 --> 07:52.155
Now... ooh, Diane, come on, please,

07:52.155 --> 07:54.040
books are our friends.

07:57.827 --> 08:00.329
The page is 37 there.

08:00.329 --> 08:02.331
Yes, thank you. Yeah.

08:02.331 --> 08:04.333
Well... (chuckles)

08:04.333 --> 08:08.337
Diane Chambers is nothing
if not open-minded.

08:08.337 --> 08:10.339
Perhaps you...

08:10.339 --> 08:11.724
you do have some

08:11.724 --> 08:13.176
spark of talent.

08:13.176 --> 08:14.060
They published your poem, huh?

08:14.060 --> 08:15.511
CLIFF: All right!

08:15.511 --> 08:17.013
Hey, don't let it get out, though,

08:17.013 --> 08:18.014
that I'm a sensitive guy.

08:18.014 --> 08:19.899
Oh, yeah, yeah!

08:19.899 --> 08:21.901
Hey, Sammy!

08:24.353 --> 08:27.740
Very well, I've arrived
at my objective opinion.

08:27.740 --> 08:30.409
All right. This is one of the most...

08:30.409 --> 08:33.246
amateurish, hackneyed,
odious pieces of effluvium

08:33.246 --> 08:35.114
ever to wash down the pike.

08:36.365 --> 08:37.616
Listen to this drivel.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.538
"I fly through a puckish arena,

08:42.538 --> 08:44.540
"where echoes dance, where echoes dance,

08:44.540 --> 08:48.044
where echoes dance..."

08:48.044 --> 08:49.929
This sounds familiar.

08:49.929 --> 08:52.265
Well, you said it three times.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.637
This poem is plagiarized.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.055
Oh, now I stole it?

08:59.055 --> 09:01.557
And a minute ago, you said it stunk.

09:01.557 --> 09:02.558
It does stink.

09:02.558 --> 09:04.477
Leave it to you to not have the sense

09:04.477 --> 09:05.978
to steal something worthwhile.

09:05.978 --> 09:07.363
Aw, you know, I realize

09:07.363 --> 09:09.732
that it's tough to
have somebody come along

09:09.732 --> 09:11.234
and swipe your dreams of glory,

09:11.234 --> 09:13.619
so I will not take
offense at that remark.

09:13.619 --> 09:16.072
That poem is fraudulent,

09:16.072 --> 09:18.708
and I intend to find its true source,

09:18.708 --> 09:21.494
even if I have to search through
every greeting card to do so.

09:21.994 --> 09:23.496
(Sam laughs)

09:23.496 --> 09:27.250
Believe me, Sam Malone, I
will not rest until today,

09:27.250 --> 09:29.585
the blackest day in the
history of literature,

09:29.585 --> 09:31.971
is blotted out for all eternity.

09:31.971 --> 09:34.257
Diane, I think you're
getting overexcited.

09:34.257 --> 09:36.142
Uh, why don't you just calm down?

09:36.142 --> 09:37.760
I tell you, I've just come

09:37.760 --> 09:39.061
from my Coping With Anxiety Group,

09:39.061 --> 09:40.563
and I have just the trick.

09:40.563 --> 09:42.815
Now, here.

09:42.815 --> 09:44.150
Put this over your head and breathe.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.939
I assure you, I am in complete control.

09:49.939 --> 09:52.908
I think the bag's a good idea anyhow.

09:58.664 --> 10:00.449
It's been proven time and time again

10:00.449 --> 10:03.452
that reincarnation breaks no
physical laws as we know 'em.

10:03.452 --> 10:05.955
You know, I was thinking
about this the other day,

10:05.955 --> 10:08.457
and, uh, I think in my next life

10:08.457 --> 10:11.844
I'd like to come back as
the president of France.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.629
Why is that, Wood?

10:13.629 --> 10:17.133
Well, I think it'd attract
a lot of business to the bar.

10:23.522 --> 10:25.391
Coffee, Woody.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.643
Oh, sure thing, Miss Chambers.

10:28.644 --> 10:30.529
I'll take the pot.

10:32.448 --> 10:35.201
Say, what's with Diane there?

10:35.201 --> 10:37.870
FRASIER: She's still
searching for Sam's poem.

10:37.870 --> 10:40.323
Dr. Crane, I think you
ought to talk to her.

10:40.323 --> 10:42.825
I mean, all she does
is read, read, read.

10:42.825 --> 10:45.211
I bet she goes through a book a week.

10:51.550 --> 10:52.551
Uh...

10:52.551 --> 10:54.387
Diane, uh,

10:54.387 --> 10:56.255
Diane, you don't smoke.

10:56.255 --> 10:57.757
What's your point?

11:02.261 --> 11:03.763
Hey, there!

11:03.763 --> 11:06.766
Still looking for that poem, huh?

11:08.768 --> 11:11.020
I'm sure it's a post-war piece.

11:11.020 --> 11:12.822
It's not British. The syntax is wrong.

11:12.822 --> 11:15.741
I have a hunch it might be regional.

11:15.741 --> 11:18.160
You may not believe this, but, uh,

11:18.160 --> 11:20.162
I do sympathize with you.

11:20.162 --> 11:21.914
It's not easy

11:21.914 --> 11:24.700
to watch those people you scoffed at

11:24.700 --> 11:28.704
run past you while you
remain stuck in the mud

11:28.704 --> 11:30.589
like a weighted-down elephant.

11:31.507 --> 11:34.009
Made that up.

11:35.511 --> 11:38.514
Does this mean that
you've stopped trying

11:38.514 --> 11:40.516
to get your poetry published?

11:40.516 --> 11:42.017
Not at all.

11:42.017 --> 11:43.519
Oh...

11:43.519 --> 11:46.522
I'm diligently producing new work.

11:46.522 --> 11:48.023
Well, that-that's good.

11:48.023 --> 11:51.026
Uh, I'd love to talk to you about it.

11:51.026 --> 11:52.895
Uh, how's it goin', Diane?

11:52.895 --> 11:55.231
Would you like to know how it's going?

11:55.231 --> 11:56.232
Yeah.

11:58.734 --> 12:00.736
This is how it's going.

12:01.237 --> 12:02.738
I'm totally blocked.

12:02.738 --> 12:04.240
I can't write another word.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.541
Hmm.

12:05.541 --> 12:08.377
"Hurricane of Wills," unfinished.

12:08.377 --> 12:12.882
"The Death of a Shallow
Man," unfinished.

12:12.882 --> 12:18.387
"A Bartender Dismembered,"

12:18.387 --> 12:19.255
unfinished.

12:21.090 --> 12:25.594
I suffer failure after
failure while you, a despoiler

12:25.594 --> 12:26.512
of the English language

12:26.512 --> 12:29.014
are lionized in front of the world.

12:33.519 --> 12:36.021
That's how it's going.

12:36.522 --> 12:39.024
Well, maybe this little literary chat

12:39.024 --> 12:41.026
wasn't such a good idea.

12:41.026 --> 12:42.528
Wanna make out?

12:45.781 --> 12:47.283
Well...

12:47.283 --> 12:50.286
Make out?

12:50.286 --> 12:51.787
Diane, now listen, uh, listen,

12:51.787 --> 12:53.789
I think the joke's gone
far enough, don't you?

12:53.789 --> 12:55.791
You haven't eaten a
decent meal in a week.

12:55.791 --> 12:58.043
You're living off of
cigarettes and coffee.

12:58.043 --> 12:59.378
I mean, for God's sake,

12:59.378 --> 13:02.765
this little literary magazine's
circulation must be what, 600.

13:02.765 --> 13:04.216
That's just the beginning.

13:04.216 --> 13:06.602
You see,

13:06.602 --> 13:10.356
the original 600 readers
drop their copies on buses,

13:10.356 --> 13:14.643
in taxicabs and doctors' offices.

13:14.643 --> 13:16.645
And another 600 people pick them up

13:16.645 --> 13:18.647
and take them to the airport,

13:18.647 --> 13:20.533
where they go all over the country.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.369
And then they get taken
on international flights.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.321
Tierra del Fuego, Sierra Leone;

13:25.321 --> 13:27.206
all the remotest parts of the world.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.875
And soon, I defy you to find me a house,

13:29.875 --> 13:32.828
a hut, an igloo or a wickiup

13:32.828 --> 13:36.332
that doesn't have a
copy on the coffee table.

13:37.216 --> 13:38.717
Diane...

13:38.717 --> 13:39.718
And then, then, then

13:39.718 --> 13:41.170
(voice breaking): everyone in the world,

13:41.170 --> 13:45.057
every living thing
will be laughing at me!

13:45.057 --> 13:48.844
Because he got published, and I did not!

13:51.146 --> 13:53.148
Hi, everybody, I'm back!

13:53.148 --> 13:55.150
CLIFF: Hey, Carla!

13:55.150 --> 13:56.652
How was the trip?

13:56.652 --> 14:00.656
Greatest vacation I have
ever taken in my life.

14:00.656 --> 14:03.158
Graceland does not disappoint.

14:03.158 --> 14:06.028
And to commemorate the
special anniversary,

14:06.028 --> 14:08.864
I had this picture
taken of me and Elvis.

14:08.864 --> 14:10.866
CLIFF: Oh, look at that.

14:10.866 --> 14:11.867
How do they do that?

14:11.867 --> 14:13.752
They use cardboard cutouts.

14:13.752 --> 14:17.506
Wow, you know, you look
almost lifelike here.

14:21.260 --> 14:24.430
So do you, Woody.

14:24.430 --> 14:27.216
Woody, more coffee.

14:27.216 --> 14:29.969
Okay, Miss Chambers.

14:29.969 --> 14:32.855
I've got something to cheer ya up.

14:32.855 --> 14:35.274
I sent in a poem to
that magazine of yours.

14:35.274 --> 14:40.062
Oh, my God, don't tell me
that they published yours, too?

14:40.062 --> 14:43.399
No, I got one of your

14:43.399 --> 14:46.902
"soon and inevitably
to be accepted" letters.

14:49.405 --> 14:53.826
Huh? That's pretty exciting.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.828
Oh, my God.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.496
Sam was right.

14:59.331 --> 15:02.134
Sam the Bard.

15:06.589 --> 15:09.341
It was a form letter all along.

15:09.341 --> 15:13.178
We two were sent a
condescending form letter.

15:13.178 --> 15:15.180
I'm framing mine.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.996
Hi.

15:32.998 --> 15:34.500
You okay?

15:36.502 --> 15:38.370
You win, Sam.

15:38.370 --> 15:41.674
I've struggled so hard for so long

15:41.674 --> 15:44.593
to keep my dreams alive,

15:44.593 --> 15:46.962
and I haven't fooled anyone but myself.

15:46.962 --> 15:51.266
I know all along you all considered me

15:51.266 --> 15:55.938
a pretentious, self-deluded windbag

15:55.938 --> 15:59.942
and apparently, you've all been right.

15:59.942 --> 16:03.445
I'm never going to be Diane
Chambers, the great poet,

16:03.445 --> 16:05.364
the world-famous novelist,

16:05.364 --> 16:08.567
the revered artist.

16:08.567 --> 16:12.571
I've gone as high as I'm going to go.

16:12.571 --> 16:14.823
I'm a waitress in a beer hall...

16:16.992 --> 16:20.295
...and not a very good one.

16:22.998 --> 16:24.383
A waitress.

16:26.335 --> 16:27.836
A waitress.

16:29.838 --> 16:31.840
A waitress.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.592
Miss,

16:33.592 --> 16:34.760
could you take our order?

16:34.760 --> 16:36.095
(sobbing)

16:39.565 --> 16:42.067
Come on. Let's go have
a talk in my office.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.569
Come on.

16:43.569 --> 16:45.070
Sweetheart?

16:56.532 --> 16:58.033
Okay, come on, sweetheart. Come on.

16:58.033 --> 17:00.536
Sit in the big chair there.

17:06.040 --> 17:09.044
Okay, I have something,
uh, I have to say here.

17:09.044 --> 17:10.846
And, uh, I just want you to promise

17:10.846 --> 17:13.214
before I say it

17:13.214 --> 17:15.968
that you, uh, won't go crazy.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.269
Don't worry.

17:17.269 --> 17:18.771
I've hit rock bottom.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.272
I have no emotions left.

17:21.272 --> 17:25.277
Oh, all right. Um...

17:25.277 --> 17:29.648
I, uh, I did copy that poem.

17:31.483 --> 17:33.318
You are scum.

17:35.788 --> 17:39.041
I tried to make one up
myself, but I-I just couldn't,

17:39.041 --> 17:41.660
and so I-I copied one.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.580
I never thought it would
be published, I promise.

17:44.580 --> 17:48.801
What could you possibly
have been thinking of, Sam?

17:50.052 --> 17:52.337
It obviously had been
published to begin with.

17:52.337 --> 17:55.224
No, no, no, it hadn't.

17:55.224 --> 17:56.892
Well, then please tell me.

17:56.892 --> 17:58.677
I think you owe me that much.

17:58.677 --> 18:00.062
Where did it come from?

18:00.062 --> 18:03.982
Well, actually, it,
uh, came from a letter

18:03.982 --> 18:07.486
that you wrote to me.

18:11.406 --> 18:13.242
One of my letters?

18:13.242 --> 18:15.027
Mm-hmm.

18:15.027 --> 18:17.029
And when you didn't
recognize it out there,

18:17.029 --> 18:20.032
I decided to play it out,

18:20.032 --> 18:23.919
and rub your smug little nose in it.

18:23.919 --> 18:28.006
I'm sorry. I probably went too far.

18:29.208 --> 18:33.962
Oh, my God, it's one of mine.

18:33.962 --> 18:37.933
How could I not recognize
this exquisite fluidity?

18:40.385 --> 18:42.354
The characteristic Chambers' grace

18:42.855 --> 18:44.106
in the face of hard imagery?

18:44.106 --> 18:46.525
Come on. You told me that it stunk.

18:46.525 --> 18:49.311
Sam, I'm a poet, not a critic.

18:51.146 --> 18:53.148
Oh...

18:53.148 --> 18:54.149
I'm published!

18:54.149 --> 18:55.150
Yeah!

18:55.651 --> 18:57.152
I'm published!

18:57.152 --> 18:58.654
Oh, this is so exciting!

18:58.654 --> 19:02.124
This is like... like
the first time I ever...

19:02.124 --> 19:04.626
rode a bicycle.

19:04.626 --> 19:06.545
Oh, this is great.

19:06.545 --> 19:07.546
You're-you're not mad.

19:07.546 --> 19:10.833
Mad? I'm elated.

19:10.833 --> 19:13.218
Hey, all... I'm elated, too.

19:13.218 --> 19:16.722
Oh, what a glorious day.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.724
I'm going to go do what poets do...

19:19.474 --> 19:21.176
...drink myself stinky.

19:21.176 --> 19:22.010
(laughs)

19:26.014 --> 19:28.517
Wait a minute.

19:28.517 --> 19:31.019
This always happens.

19:31.019 --> 19:35.524
You always squirm out of
these things unscathed.

19:35.524 --> 19:37.359
You did a terrible thing!

19:37.359 --> 19:39.194
I know it.

19:39.194 --> 19:41.163
No, you don't.

19:42.664 --> 19:46.118
You put me through hell.

19:46.118 --> 19:49.121
This time it's going to be different.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.622
I'm going to make you suffer.

19:50.622 --> 19:52.958
What-what're you going to do?

19:54.459 --> 19:56.962
I don't know.

19:56.962 --> 19:57.963
Yes, I do.

19:57.963 --> 20:00.966
You're going out there
and admit to everyone

20:00.966 --> 20:03.468
that you stole this poem from me.

20:03.468 --> 20:06.471
Oh, come on, you mean I have to go out

20:06.471 --> 20:09.474
and tell the whole bar
that I'm not a poet?

20:11.360 --> 20:12.361
You sure do, mister.

20:12.361 --> 20:14.112
Let's go.

20:21.904 --> 20:22.905
(gasps)

20:22.905 --> 20:24.406
What? What? What? What? What? Mm...

20:28.410 --> 20:29.912
What are you doin'?

20:33.916 --> 20:36.418
Oh, yeah, I've heard about this.

20:39.922 --> 20:41.423
Mm-mm.

20:43.892 --> 20:47.813
You wanna go back to my
place and ride a bike?

20:52.317 --> 20:54.820
Don't you ever, ever
again try to tell me

20:54.820 --> 20:56.822
that you don't love me.

20:56.822 --> 20:59.191
Oh, God, every time I think I'm about

20:59.191 --> 21:00.158
to get my hedge clipped,

21:00.659 --> 21:01.660
you start talkin' about love,

21:01.660 --> 21:03.161
and it's just not fair.

21:03.161 --> 21:05.447
You saved my love letters.

21:05.447 --> 21:08.700
I was so excited about
being a published poet,

21:08.700 --> 21:10.202
it didn't sink in at first.

21:10.202 --> 21:11.203
This proves it.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.705
You love me now as you always did,

21:13.705 --> 21:15.207
madly and completely.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.708
Hey, wait, listen to me.

21:16.708 --> 21:18.460
I did not save your letters.

21:18.961 --> 21:20.462
Where did this come from?

21:20.462 --> 21:22.214
I found it in my apartment.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.016
I got pizza boxes that old

21:24.016 --> 21:27.019
that have more meaning. Come on.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.520
Sam Malone, look me in the eyes

21:28.520 --> 21:30.522
and tell me you don't love me.

21:30.522 --> 21:31.523
If you can do that,

21:31.523 --> 21:34.026
then I have no choice
but to believe you.

21:36.945 --> 21:39.448
Oh, boy, I'm sorry, but...

21:41.450 --> 21:44.453
...I don't love you, Diane.

21:44.453 --> 21:46.238
Uh, I thought I did once,

21:46.238 --> 21:48.240
but I was wrong.

21:48.240 --> 21:51.743
There's nothin' goin'
on between us here.

21:51.743 --> 21:53.245
I mean, it's all over.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.252
Very well.

22:00.752 --> 22:03.255
That was in the eyes, wasn't it?

22:03.255 --> 22:04.256
I guess I'll go

22:04.256 --> 22:07.259
before I make a bigger fool of myself.

22:35.504 --> 22:38.006
Aha!

22:39.007 --> 22:40.876
What the hell are you doing?

22:43.261 --> 22:45.263
I came to catch you in a lie, and I did.

22:45.263 --> 22:47.766
Don't I know my darling
better than anyone else?

22:49.768 --> 22:51.770
Okay, so I kept some of
your letters. Big deal.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.772
I mean, that doesn't prove anything.

22:53.772 --> 22:55.140
I mean, I got lots of junk in here.

22:55.140 --> 22:55.941
Look at this.

22:55.941 --> 22:57.442
I save all sorts of things.

22:57.442 --> 22:58.944
Look-look at that. Where is it?

22:58.944 --> 23:00.445
A warranty for my toaster.

23:00.445 --> 23:02.447
Look at that, huh?

23:02.447 --> 23:04.449
My letters.

23:04.449 --> 23:05.450
A ticket--
here-here it is--

23:05.450 --> 23:07.953
a ticket to, uh, 1980 boat show.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.454
Your protests only prove my point.

23:09.454 --> 23:11.957
There, poker chips. Three poker chips.

23:11.957 --> 23:13.458
You know, Sam, Each
one of these poker chips

23:13.458 --> 23:15.460
I was thinking. means more
to me than your letters.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.462
You know when we finally
do get married, A key.

23:17.462 --> 23:18.964
we could move to the country. A whistle.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.465
Not too far away Look
at that-- a whistle.

23:20.465 --> 23:21.967
because I couldn't be
far from the theater.

23:21.967 --> 23:23.969
A double-C battery. And I know
how much you love the ocean.

23:24.469 --> 23:26.972
Sam...

23:26.972 --> 23:29.724
Four paper clips.
