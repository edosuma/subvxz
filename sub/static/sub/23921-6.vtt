01:07.692 --> 01:11.237
So, this magic rock
is gonna guide us to a mysterious planet?

01:11.321 --> 01:13.948
A land known as Oriande.

01:14.032 --> 01:17.077
I'm afraid someone's been ruggling
your wimble, Prince Lotor.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.789
Oriande is just an Altean folktale.
It doesn't actually exist.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.540
That's what I thought, Coran,

01:22.624 --> 01:25.794
but now, I have a feeling
it is quite real.

01:25.877 --> 01:28.671
It is the birthplace
of all Altean alchemy.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.840
The place where King Alfor
learned the secrets

01:30.924 --> 01:32.550
that helped him create Voltron

01:32.634 --> 01:35.094
and where Allura will master
those same secrets

01:35.178 --> 01:37.722
so that my ships may enter
the quintessence field.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.059
And what makes you the authority
on crazy Altean nonsense?

01:41.142 --> 01:43.103
Coran knows more magic
made-up gobbledygook

01:43.186 --> 01:45.814
-than anyone I've ever met.
-Thank you, Lance.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.775
And I can assure you,
King Alfor never mentioned anything to me

01:48.858 --> 01:50.401
about traveling to Oriande.

01:50.485 --> 01:53.488
In all likelihood,
he kept it a secret from everyone.

01:53.571 --> 01:56.199
I have been researching Oriande
for centuries,

01:56.282 --> 01:59.327
hoping to learn more
about my Altean ancestry.

01:59.410 --> 02:02.664
Over time, I've managed to gather evidence
from all over the universe

02:02.747 --> 02:04.207
that hinted at its existence.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.376
Now, thanks to Princess Allura,

02:06.459 --> 02:10.170
I will finally gaze upon its magnificence
with my own eyes.

02:10.420 --> 02:12.632
Uh, aren't you a little busy
running your empire

02:12.715 --> 02:14.717
to take a magical vacation?

02:14.801 --> 02:18.471
In order to transition the Galra Empire
to a peaceful existence,

02:18.555 --> 02:21.432
I need to open up a pathway
to the quintessence field.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.977
Once my people have access
to unlimited energy,

02:24.060 --> 02:26.729
the old ways of the empire
will be behind them.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.023
If this voyage is successful,

02:29.107 --> 02:32.402
the universe will finally be
on the path to peace.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.697
Well, let's find out where we're going.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.503
There,
between those three celestial bodies.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.046
That's where we're headed.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.800
-Wait a tick, that's the Patrulian Zone.
-The what now?

02:56.593 --> 02:59.137
The Patrulian Zone
is a mysterious part of space

02:59.220 --> 03:02.056
where ships enter
and are never heard from again.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.436
Princess, that area has been deemed
unsafe to navigate for ages.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.105
The perfect place to hide a magical world.

03:09.188 --> 03:10.690
Or to crash and die.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.653
We will approach with caution.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.572
Prepare our course, Coran.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.824
Yes, Princess.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.124
We're approaching the Patrulian Zone.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.752
What's that up ahead? An asteroid belt?

03:31.502 --> 03:32.503
No.

03:33.421 --> 03:34.714
It's a graveyard.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.014
What caused them all to lose power?

03:44.098 --> 03:45.475
No one knows.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.521
I think we just found out.

04:01.115 --> 04:06.537
-Is that some kind of super massive star?
-No. Unbelievable! It's a white hole!

04:06.913 --> 04:09.749
Whoa! Take that, theoretical physics!

04:09.832 --> 04:11.542
Wait, what's a white hole?

04:11.626 --> 04:13.169
Well, unlike a black hole,

04:13.253 --> 04:15.588
which has massive gravity
that sucks everything in,

04:15.672 --> 04:19.175
a white hole is an opposite body
that shoots massive amounts of energy out

04:19.259 --> 04:20.927
from an unknown source.

04:21.010 --> 04:24.055
It's blasting this whole area
with crazy high radiation.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.100
The energy must've fried
those ships' systems.

04:28.851 --> 04:33.273
"The wise stand back from the fire,
fools are burned on the pyre.

04:33.356 --> 04:38.194
The mystic becomes one with the flame,
the embers and he are the same."

04:38.278 --> 04:41.489
Is that, like, a song you're working on?
'Cause it sucks.

04:41.572 --> 04:44.117
It's a poem
by an ancient Altean alchemist.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.495
I discovered it carved
next to a cave painting of a fiery sphere.

04:48.079 --> 04:52.417
I never realized until now
that it describes the route to Oriande.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.502
We must go into the white hole.

04:54.585 --> 04:57.213
Are you guys serious?
We're navigating by cave poetry now?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.299
How are we to go
through the white hole?

04:59.382 --> 05:02.385
If we get closer, we're gonna end up
like those dead ships there.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.389
We wormhole inside.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.640
Princess, no!

05:07.724 --> 05:10.393
Voltron can withstand forces
other ships cannot.

05:10.977 --> 05:11.894
Are you sure?

05:12.478 --> 05:16.232
If this is the home of Altean alchemy,
then Voltron will make it through.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.193
And what if it's just another
nuclear explosion in space?

05:19.277 --> 05:20.486
Then we're toast.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.323
Princess, I think
you've taken this quest far enough.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.408
Lotor is sending you to your doom.

05:25.491 --> 05:28.619
Quite the opposite.
It is a mission of life discovery.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.455
You need to zip it!

05:30.538 --> 05:34.125
Believe me, I would never ask any of you
to do this if I didn't know...

05:34.709 --> 05:38.296
if I didn't feel in my heart
that it is true.

05:38.379 --> 05:39.589
I belong here.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.304
This is as far as we can go.

05:46.387 --> 05:49.599
Any further and we'll be affected
by the Patrulian Zone's radiation.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.047
All right, Coran,
open up a wormhole.

06:22.507 --> 06:25.468
Well, let's fly
into the cosmic death storm.

06:39.190 --> 06:42.360
We're being blasted backward!
Full power to thrusters!

06:48.282 --> 06:50.159
We're making progress!

06:58.751 --> 07:00.837
Is that... a lion?

07:07.135 --> 07:09.846
-Why is it attacking us?
-Fire lasers!

07:15.977 --> 07:17.186
There's nothing to hit!

07:26.612 --> 07:27.864
What have you done?

07:28.656 --> 07:30.533
Wait, what's happening to your face?

07:31.117 --> 07:33.494
-What?
-You have Altean marks.

07:33.578 --> 07:34.620
And they're glowing.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.957
The Mark of the Chosen.

07:38.040 --> 07:38.958
What?

07:41.252 --> 07:42.920
You need to get out of there!

07:43.004 --> 07:46.549
That thing is a guardian!
It will only allow worthy Alteans through.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.718
Oh, thanks for the tip!

07:48.801 --> 07:49.802
Pull back!

08:02.565 --> 08:04.317
All systems shutting down!

08:04.400 --> 08:08.154
Our stabilizers aren't working!
We're listing into the graveyard!

08:09.906 --> 08:11.741
We must get back to the Castle.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.222
I can't control my lion!

08:34.304 --> 08:37.099
Me neither. I've lost power.

08:37.767 --> 08:41.270
- I'm dead in the water.
- I think we all are.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.231
These lions aren't going anywhere.

08:43.313 --> 08:47.735
Everyone, prepare for a manual EVA.
Rendezvous back at the Castle.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.821
We need to figure this out.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.964
I managed to restore auxiliary power,
but it won't last long.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.800
If we don't get the Castle running
within the next quintant,

09:10.883 --> 09:12.093
we'll be out of air.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.554
Maybe we can decrease
our breathers by one.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.348
Uh, what's up with your face?

09:17.431 --> 09:19.934
Yeah, and if this is the home
of Altean alchemy,

09:20.017 --> 09:21.519
why can't Voltron get in?

09:22.103 --> 09:25.982
I am sorry to put us in this position,
but I think I know the answer.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.483
Look at Allura.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.738
Whoa! What's happening?

09:35.032 --> 09:38.869
-You have them, too.
-It's called the Mark of the Chosen.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.330
They are mentioned
in some of the Oriande legends.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.125
They indicate those worthy
of entering the realm.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.753
Wait, why aren't Coran's marks glowing?

09:47.837 --> 09:49.922
There are different types of Alteans.

09:50.006 --> 09:53.593
Allura possesses a deep connection
to ancient Altean energy.

09:53.676 --> 09:57.805
It enables her to operate the teludav
and change her shape and size.

09:57.888 --> 10:01.434
Her father had greater alchemic
understanding than any before him.

10:02.018 --> 10:06.230
Others are less magical, no offense.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.357
So, what do we do now?

10:08.441 --> 10:11.193
Allura and I need to enter
the white hole alone.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.488
-What?
-Absolutely not! What about the monster?

10:14.572 --> 10:17.450
The monster is a guard
keeping the unworthy out.

10:17.533 --> 10:18.909
It won't hurt us.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.579
Yeah, and before,
you thought it wasn't going to hurt us!

10:21.662 --> 10:23.748
How are you gonna get there? We're stuck.

10:23.831 --> 10:26.000
We can use the personal transport crafts.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.961
Allura, please! It's too dangerous.

10:29.462 --> 10:33.049
Coran, I must gain some kind
of alchemic knowledge in Oriande,

10:33.132 --> 10:36.844
both to save our own lives
and bring peace to the universe.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.680
Coran, don't tell me
you're going to cave in on this!

10:39.764 --> 10:41.807
Lance, she's right.

10:42.683 --> 10:45.978
The ship is stuck unless the princess
can somehow get it restarted.

10:46.062 --> 10:50.107
Don't worry. This will work.
I can feel it.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.622
-Did they make it in?
-I don't know.

11:04.705 --> 11:07.875
I can't get any readings
beyond the edge of the white hole.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.127
We'll just have to wait.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.747
Huh?

11:59.093 --> 12:00.344
It's amazing.

12:11.272 --> 12:14.442
None of my research or travels
have prepared me for this.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.485
From here, we are on our own.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.036
Anything?

12:26.954 --> 12:27.872
No.

12:27.955 --> 12:30.416
What's happening?
What do you think they're doing now?

12:30.499 --> 12:31.709
- Now?
- Yes.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.669
- No.
- Wait, what?

12:33.752 --> 12:36.839
We're not talking to you, Lance.
Is this doing anything?

12:36.922 --> 12:40.050
Do you think she's all right?
I mean, will they be able to get back?

12:40.134 --> 12:41.969
-I don't think so.
-You don't?

12:42.052 --> 12:45.514
- He's not talking to you.
- Well, excuse me for being concerned!

12:45.598 --> 12:47.641
Coran, try to fire the chargers.

12:47.725 --> 12:50.144
Nerve-racking waiting
for Allura to get back.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.062
- I'm afraid they're dead.
- What?

12:52.146 --> 12:55.065
Shiro! Can you take Lance, please?

12:58.652 --> 13:00.404
It's okay, Shiro.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.907
I'll be quiet.
You don't have to babysit me.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.868
Lance, let me ask you something.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.829
Do you remember, on Olkarion,

13:08.913 --> 13:13.918
how you asked me about talking to you
from inside Voltron?

13:15.586 --> 13:16.420
Yeah.

13:17.338 --> 13:20.883
What happened there?
I can't remember any of it.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.345
We were all in some kind of
mystical Voltron mindspace,

13:24.428 --> 13:27.264
and you were yelling something,
but I couldn't hear you.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.224
Are you okay?

13:28.974 --> 13:31.477
I-- I don't know.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.312
My head...

13:33.938 --> 13:34.939
I'm just...

13:35.648 --> 13:37.608
I'm feeling so confused.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.902
-It's like...
-What?

13:41.904 --> 13:43.656
Like I'm not myself.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.619
It's probably just lack of oxygen.

13:48.702 --> 13:51.163
You should sit down.
We'll get through this.

14:01.590 --> 14:02.633
I'm bored.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.386
How long are we just gonna drift here?

14:05.469 --> 14:08.180
Until Haggar decides
what our next move is.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.686
While she's doing her magical pondering,
we could be out conquering.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.437
The whole empire is in chaos.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.983
We play our cards right, and we have
a nice little territory of our own.

14:19.066 --> 14:22.319
You think we could replace Lotor
as emperor?

14:22.403 --> 14:23.404
Who knows?

14:23.487 --> 14:26.198
If we start taking
the other commanders out, one by one,

14:26.282 --> 14:28.158
we could be the last ones standing.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.953
No one is replacing Lotor.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.289
We just need to wait
for orders from Haggar.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.295
-You wanna go throw things at the crew?
-Yes!

14:52.808 --> 14:54.810
I wonder if Father climbed this mountain.

14:56.395 --> 15:00.024
You know, I envy you
growing up with King Alfor.

15:00.107 --> 15:04.069
I always wanted to be an explorer
and learn about the universe.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.697
My father was only interested
in conquering it.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.824
He put me in charge
of a planet for a year,

15:08.908 --> 15:12.286
running the quintessence mining
and getting to know the local population.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.664
Rather than employ
the usual Galran methods of subjugation,

15:15.748 --> 15:19.668
I worked alongside the leadership
of the planet, learning their customs.

15:19.752 --> 15:23.255
We would only extract as much quintessence
as could be replenished.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.382
And I enjoyed my time there quite a bit.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.676
When my father found out
what was happening,

15:27.760 --> 15:29.929
he ordered me to destroy the planet.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.389
I refused, and he sent me away.

15:33.849 --> 15:38.187
-At least you stood up for those people.
-He destroyed them all.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.064
I was powerless to stop him.

15:40.147 --> 15:44.610
I spent the following centuries searching
for clues about my Altean heritage,

15:44.693 --> 15:47.029
another culture destroyed by Zarkon.

15:47.571 --> 15:49.448
I'm glad you're here to help me now.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.533
I never would have gotten here
without you.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.831
Look at these ancient markings.
They're beautiful.

16:38.914 --> 16:40.916
The Temple of the Alchemists.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.128
The mysteries we seek
are hidden somewhere deep inside.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.199
The Sages of Oriande.

17:17.077 --> 17:20.497
My father told me tales of their exploits,
but I always assumed

17:20.580 --> 17:24.460
-they were just children's stories.
-The Life Givers.

17:24.542 --> 17:28.630
They were the first Alteans
to unlock the secrets of Oriande,

17:28.714 --> 17:30.549
the beginning of Altean alchemy.

17:31.592 --> 17:35.637
Allura, the tales you grew up with
were not just children's stories.

17:51.904 --> 17:55.657
Great protectors,
we seek passage through your land.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.910
We bring you this gift.

18:15.302 --> 18:19.306
-Now, what?
-I don't know, but be prepared.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.518
We may yet have to prove
that we're worthy to be here.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.525
We're trapped.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.200
There must be a clue.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.661
Something a trained Altean
would recognize.

18:46.583 --> 18:47.709
There!

18:47.793 --> 18:50.420
It's like the bridge of the Castle!
A teludav!

19:14.820 --> 19:16.155
Allura?

19:37.885 --> 19:41.013
I do not wish to fight.
I come seeking knowledge.

19:50.439 --> 19:53.609
I will never yield.
I will gain your secrets.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.492
What can I do?

20:08.498 --> 20:10.626
Victory or death!

20:26.433 --> 20:28.393
No. No!

20:33.273 --> 20:36.860
No. This isn't the way.
I seek the secret of life.

20:39.821 --> 20:40.822
I give my own.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.336
Where am I?

20:55.087 --> 20:58.298
You have returned
to the realm of your ancestors,

20:58.382 --> 21:02.511
the Alteans
and the Life Givers who came before.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.514
I wish to learn the secrets
my father knew,

21:05.973 --> 21:08.267
the alchemy that created Voltron.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.936
There is no need to kneel here.

21:11.478 --> 21:13.021
You are home,

21:13.105 --> 21:16.608
and the secret is already within you.

21:17.317 --> 21:20.696
Rise, let us embrace you.

21:29.079 --> 21:32.165
Oxygen levels-- 5%

21:32.249 --> 21:34.501
There must be some way for us...

21:34.584 --> 21:36.461
to harness the power of the white hole...

21:36.545 --> 21:39.047
and use it to get the ship working.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.134
We've tried everything.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.429
I don't think... I can keep moving.

21:45.512 --> 21:48.265
Guys, look! It's Allu...

22:02.654 --> 22:03.655
You did it!

22:04.448 --> 22:07.826
We... We should have never doubted you.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.287
I couldn't have done it without Lotor.

22:12.998 --> 22:18.253
You are a true Altean alchemist.
Oriande was for you, not for me.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.721
So, what's the next step?

22:27.804 --> 22:31.058
Slow down, Pidge.
We just started breathing again.

22:37.397 --> 22:40.192
I have the coordinates
for our next destination.

22:40.776 --> 22:41.777
Where are we headed?

22:42.527 --> 22:46.490
A place I've been searching for
my entire life.
