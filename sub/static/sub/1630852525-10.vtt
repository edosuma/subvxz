WEBVTT

00:49.516 --> 00:52.285
- Don't eat the beans! Don't eat the beans!

00:52.385 --> 00:54.621
- Zombies! Zombies!

00:54.721 --> 00:55.855
- Dory!

00:55.922 --> 00:57.090
- Hey! Watch it!

00:57.190 --> 00:58.691
- Hey! Get off of me!

00:58.758 --> 01:00.260
- What the hell is wrong with you?

01:03.363 --> 01:04.964
- Stop it! - I can't hold 'em back!

01:06.299 --> 01:08.268
- Put her down, man. Put her down.

01:08.368 --> 01:10.103
- Hey! Hey, hey.

01:10.203 --> 01:12.806
- Help! Someone help me!

01:14.941 --> 01:16.209
- Hey. - Hey.

01:16.276 --> 01:17.477
- What is happening? - I don't know.

01:17.577 --> 01:18.812
Everybody is freaking out.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.081
- Let's get out of here!

01:21.147 --> 01:24.951
- Oh, my God! - What is happening?

01:25.051 --> 01:26.553
- Run! Run! - Run!

01:26.619 --> 01:28.054
- What-- - Fucking run!

01:28.121 --> 01:30.390
- Right here! Right over here.

01:30.457 --> 01:31.825
Okay. Okay.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.160
I think we should just go back to my place.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.562
- What is going on?

01:35.628 --> 01:36.996
Why is everybody acting like that?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.598
- Maybe we should have had them form a line

01:38.665 --> 01:40.467
so things could have been a little more orderly.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.902
- Yeah. - God, it's the pills, babe.

01:42.969 --> 01:45.939
They turn people into--

01:46.005 --> 01:47.340
into zombies.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.176
- What?

01:50.276 --> 01:52.345
- Zombies. - What do you mean?

01:52.445 --> 01:54.647
- Zombies. Zombies. - Zombies, Drew.

01:54.747 --> 01:56.015
The people that eat the other people.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.684
- They got Winnie, Winnie got Luz.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.319
And then, she bit Helen, and Helen's on top of the car.

01:59.419 --> 02:01.020
- And then, Helen. And then-- - Okay, okay.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.455
Calm down. - No, no, no.

02:02.522 --> 02:03.923
But this can't be, all right?

02:03.990 --> 02:06.025
'Cause we ate the pills. I mean, we all took them.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.360
- Yes. - And we felt it.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.862
And didn't you guys feel it too?

02:08.962 --> 02:10.196
I mean, but we all did.

02:10.296 --> 02:12.665
- No, no, no. I swapped them, Drew.

02:12.765 --> 02:15.702
I swapped them. They were a placebo.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.604
I swapped them. - Wait.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.873
For real? - Elliott.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.341
How could you have done that?

02:21.441 --> 02:22.942
- Hello? Thank God I did.

02:23.009 --> 02:25.011
Look around you right now, Dory.

02:25.111 --> 02:27.280
My egomania saved our lives!

02:27.347 --> 02:30.517
- No, no, no.

02:30.617 --> 02:34.120
No, this is--this is just crowd hysteria.

02:34.187 --> 02:37.557
- It's not. - I mean, the pills work.

02:37.657 --> 02:38.525
They work.

02:38.625 --> 02:42.061
- The pills are bad, babe.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.398
The disciples are zombies. Everyone is gone.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.834
And if we don't figure a fucking way out of this,

02:47.901 --> 02:49.569
we will be too.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.037
- It's over, Dor.

02:51.137 --> 02:53.706
You did your best, but there's no such thing

02:53.806 --> 02:55.008
as enlightenment.

02:55.074 --> 02:58.344
Just psychosis.

02:58.411 --> 03:02.182
- Hate to say, babe, but you did it again.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.585
Except it's way worse this time.

03:06.719 --> 03:07.987
- Oh, my God! - Whoa!

03:08.054 --> 03:09.822
- Shit.

03:09.889 --> 03:11.057
- Hello?

03:11.157 --> 03:13.393
- - Okay...

03:15.061 --> 03:17.564
Excuse me. Are you okay?

03:19.098 --> 03:21.868
- - Oh, my God.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.776
Oh, my God.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.010
- Oh, God. - Great job.

03:31.077 --> 03:32.445
- Ah! - Great job. Great job.

03:32.545 --> 03:33.713
- Yeah.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.215
I'm raising chickens.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.950
- Oh, my God. In the city? - Yes.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.419
I built a coop under my bed with my uncle.

03:39.519 --> 03:40.887
It is sublime.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.455
I'm having fresh eggs every single day.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.890
- Everyone, run! - God, that sounds so good.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.425
- Mm-hmm. - The dead are coming!

03:45.525 --> 03:47.093
- What are they talking about? - I don't know.

03:47.193 --> 03:48.728
It's probably some, like, street theater troupe.

03:48.795 --> 03:49.963
Just don't make eye contact.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.097
I don't want to tip them. - Help!

03:51.197 --> 03:52.265
Help!

03:52.365 --> 03:54.300
I'm not bit! - I'm not--no.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.802
Oh, my God.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.136
- Sir, we're eating. -

03:57.237 --> 03:59.706
- This neighborhood is changing.

03:59.772 --> 04:01.474
- Yeah.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.647
- Jesus, you are adorable.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.283
Should we be together forever?

04:10.383 --> 04:12.585
- Marc! - Elliott?

04:12.652 --> 04:15.088
- What are you doing dancing with some strange man

04:15.154 --> 04:16.556
in our home?

04:16.623 --> 04:18.391
- Mourning my loss?

04:18.458 --> 04:20.994
I thought you were dead. I thought all of you were dead.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.629
- Well, we're not, and I'm glad to know

04:22.729 --> 04:25.465
it takes you three fucking days to move on.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.634
- Why was the door open? - Was it?

04:27.734 --> 04:29.902
- Do you have any idea what's happening out there, Marc?

04:29.969 --> 04:31.504
- I'm gonna leave now,

04:31.604 --> 04:34.340
but if your husband ever dies again, please call me.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.109
- Okay. - Oh, my God.

04:36.175 --> 04:37.677
- Okay, go. - Oh, my God.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.412
- Stop it. - Get out.

04:39.479 --> 04:40.480
- Bye. - Bye.

04:40.580 --> 04:41.848
- So rude and disrespectful.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.750
- Guys, come check this out. - Charmless.

04:43.816 --> 04:45.585
- Brooklyn, New York, is under siege

04:45.652 --> 04:49.188
by an unidentified contagious personality disorder.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.924
Authorities are encouraging residents to evacuate

04:51.991 --> 04:53.693
as this new trend of psychosis

04:53.793 --> 04:55.328
is aggressive and spreading at an alarming rate.

04:55.428 --> 04:56.829
- What do we do? Should we try

04:56.929 --> 04:58.331
to get out of Brooklyn, or just hide here?

04:58.431 --> 05:01.200
- No, I wanna stay here. I feel really safe here.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.469
- It has never been safe here.

05:03.536 --> 05:06.372
- Wait, where is Aspen? - In his room.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.508
He's been up there all day playing with his abacus.

05:08.608 --> 05:11.044
- There's no way it could be spreading this fast, right?

05:11.144 --> 05:12.478
- - Drew, look out!

05:14.180 --> 05:15.982
- Why is he obsessed with me?

05:16.049 --> 05:19.052
- Go! - Run! Run, run, run!

05:22.355 --> 05:24.824
- He's eating my cat!

05:24.891 --> 05:26.559
He's eating my cat!

05:26.659 --> 05:28.294
- What?

05:31.898 --> 05:34.000
- This is truly worst-case scenario.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.235
- But where do we go? - To the bridge.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.503
It's the only way out.

05:37.570 --> 05:38.638
They're sealing off the borough,

05:38.705 --> 05:39.806
so you gotta get there fast.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.507
It's honestly kind of exciting.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.042
- Which bridge? - Oh, oh, it's the one

05:43.142 --> 05:44.744
with the--oh, God. It's got all this stuff.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.046
You know, you take it to go to the city.

05:47.146 --> 05:49.148
- That could be any them. - Oh, oh, I know what it is.

05:49.215 --> 05:51.884
You know which one it is--

05:54.187 --> 05:57.190
- The bridge. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

05:57.256 --> 06:00.259
- Oh, my God. - Oh, my God.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.366
- Oh, shit.

06:06.432 --> 06:09.369
- Give me a second. I don't feel good.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.671
Oh, I guess I should not be running

06:11.738 --> 06:13.673
on a belly full of jelly beans.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.111
- What did you just say?

06:18.211 --> 06:21.247
- I said I need a second.

06:21.347 --> 06:24.951
- Marc, where did you get jelly beans?

06:25.051 --> 06:27.620
- They were in a baggy on the ground.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.122
I think they fell out of your pocket.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.723
It's fine, though. Five-second rule.

06:30.790 --> 06:34.460
They weren't dirty. - Oh, Marc, honey.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.229
- Okay. Sorry I ate them.

06:36.295 --> 06:37.797
When I get hungry, I eat.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.732
Jesus. Is that a crime?

06:39.799 --> 06:42.802
- Marc, how many did you eat?

06:42.902 --> 06:45.638
- I don't know, Drew. Eight?

06:45.738 --> 06:48.241
They weren't good. - Oh, honey.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.378
You're gonna turn into a zombie.

06:52.445 --> 06:53.780
- What?

06:53.880 --> 06:56.783
- And honestly, maybe like--

06:56.883 --> 06:58.317
like a super zombie.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.320
- No, that's not fair. - I know.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.990
- I was gonna go back to school.

07:15.468 --> 07:18.438
- What are you looking at?

07:18.504 --> 07:20.339
- Nothing.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.508
Just my beautiful life partner.

07:22.608 --> 07:27.413
- I have never been enough for you, have I?

07:33.319 --> 07:36.956
- You all have never made me feel included.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.459
- No, we love you, Marc. We love you.

07:39.525 --> 07:43.029
- It's normal to not let your friend's partner feel included.

07:43.129 --> 07:48.000
- It's time to die.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.609
- You've crashed. Doors open.

07:56.676 --> 07:59.345
- Oh, my God!

08:13.860 --> 08:16.829
- Help! Help!

08:22.735 --> 08:24.403
- Go to the Williamsburg Bridge!

08:24.504 --> 08:26.506
Go, go, go, go!

08:35.147 --> 08:38.918
- This way.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.853
- Show us your eyes.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.088
Let me see your eyes.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.589
- Oh, my God. Wait, no! - What?

08:43.689 --> 08:45.057
- Men first! - It's Gavin.

08:45.157 --> 08:46.425
- Men first. - Who?

08:46.526 --> 08:48.094
- It should be men first. - Chantal's ex.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.429
- Oh, my God, that was the worst night of my life.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.199
His tongue tasted like old ice cream and eggs.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.001
- Why is no one listening?

08:55.067 --> 08:57.203
Hey, Drew! Drew! Dory! Elliott!

08:57.270 --> 08:58.671
- Let me see your eyes, okay? - Portia!

08:58.738 --> 09:01.607
- Not us. Bye. - No, no, no. Sorry.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.876
- No. No. You've been maimed. - What?

09:03.943 --> 09:06.178
- You have to go distance yourself immediately.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.514
- No, that's just a scrape. - Portia, come on!

09:08.581 --> 09:11.350
- Stay back! No, no, no. Her eyes.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.386
There's no life in them. She's brain-dead.

09:13.452 --> 09:15.454
- What? - This woman has no brain.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.789
- Yes, I do!

09:16.889 --> 09:18.291
- No, she's a completely brain-dead moron.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.892
You gotta get her out here. - No. No. No.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.228
- Get her outta here! - No, no! I'm just leggy!

09:22.295 --> 09:23.696
I'm just leggy, Dory!

09:23.763 --> 09:25.064
- She's fine! Let her go!

09:25.131 --> 09:26.699
- Keep it moving! - Dory! Dory!

09:26.766 --> 09:28.467
- No, Portia! - Portia!

09:28.568 --> 09:30.603
- Just go. I'll figure--

09:30.703 --> 09:32.605
- Portia! -

09:32.705 --> 09:34.974
- Portia!

09:35.074 --> 09:37.810
- I love you! Guys, guys, I love you!

09:40.446 --> 09:42.748
- We left her?

09:42.815 --> 09:45.084
We just--we just left her.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.155
- No.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.490
No, we can't leave anyone behind.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.995
- Portia! all: Portia!

09:56.095 --> 09:57.563
- I'm not one of them!

09:57.630 --> 10:00.666
Please, I swear! I'm not one of them!

10:00.766 --> 10:02.268
I'm not! - Portia!

10:02.335 --> 10:03.669
- I'm not one of them! - Hey!

10:03.769 --> 10:06.172
Hey! - Drew! Ahh!

10:06.272 --> 10:07.740
- Stop! Oh, my God.

10:07.807 --> 10:09.241
Oh, my God! - Let's go!

10:09.308 --> 10:10.776
- Save me! - Come on now!

10:10.843 --> 10:12.011
- Oh, my God!

10:18.985 --> 10:22.488
- Shit.

10:22.588 --> 10:24.090
- Where are we going, you guys?

10:24.156 --> 10:25.758
- Maybe we should find a boat?

10:25.825 --> 10:28.194
There's no other way off this island!

10:28.294 --> 10:29.829
- Maybe there's a pier right here, right?

10:29.929 --> 10:31.697
This way. Come on.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.769
Abort!

10:36.836 --> 10:38.137
- Oh, my God!

10:38.204 --> 10:40.673
Okay. Okay. - There's zombies everywhere!

10:40.773 --> 10:43.376
- What do we do?

10:47.713 --> 10:50.549
- I think we're done.

10:56.455 --> 10:59.058
- Holy fuck! - Oh, my God!

10:59.158 --> 11:00.192
- Wait, over there!

11:14.206 --> 11:17.009
- Lift the gate and go down.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.914
- Go, go, go!

11:22.014 --> 11:24.083
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

11:24.183 --> 11:28.087
I'm getting so old!

11:28.187 --> 11:30.489
- Oh, my God. Oh, God.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.598
- Who are you?

11:42.268 --> 11:44.870
- I'm the person that just saved your ass.

11:47.673 --> 11:50.443
Welcome to the only safe place in New York City.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.279
I was given a key to this space by my wise mentor and wife,

11:53.379 --> 11:54.613
Liquorice Montague.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.115
There's gonna be a lot of time traveling

11:56.215 --> 11:57.349
in the next few decades,

11:57.416 --> 11:58.851
and this is the safest hub for it

11:58.918 --> 12:00.619
'cause the number one danger of time travel

12:00.720 --> 12:02.021
is ending up in the middle of a wall

12:02.088 --> 12:03.389
that got built in that spot.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.890
You don't wanna suddenly materialize

12:04.957 --> 12:06.559
in the middle of a wall.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.627
Lucky for us, no new walls will ever be built down here.

12:08.728 --> 12:12.364
- Honestly, I'll believe anything at this point.

12:12.431 --> 12:14.967
- Find a spot. Settle in.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.470
I'll be coming by with dinner before it's lights out.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.539
I hope you guys like Kind Bars.

12:23.309 --> 12:26.979
- Did you save all these people?

12:28.447 --> 12:30.583
- It's only right. I...

12:32.585 --> 12:34.420
I didn't do what I should have done

12:34.487 --> 12:35.821
when I had the chance,

12:35.921 --> 12:39.825
and now the world is ending because of me.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.995
- No.

12:43.095 --> 12:47.233
The world is ending because of me.

12:47.299 --> 12:49.568
- No.

12:49.635 --> 12:52.238
The world is ending because of me.

12:56.742 --> 12:59.845
- No.

12:59.945 --> 13:04.683
The world is ending because of me.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.188
- Okay, you've always had delusions of grandeur.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.497
Did you guys get fruit leather?

13:18.597 --> 13:20.366
- I didn't get fruit leather, but--

13:20.466 --> 13:22.601
- Some fucking faggot has fruit leather in his bag.

13:22.668 --> 13:26.605
- Oh, my God. Elliott Goss? Is that you?

13:26.672 --> 13:28.974
- Oh, my God, Janet? Hi.

13:29.041 --> 13:30.976
How are you?

13:31.043 --> 13:32.178
- I'm so good.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.346
It is so cozy in here, isn't it?

13:34.446 --> 13:36.382
This is crazy. How are you?

13:36.482 --> 13:38.450
- I'm good. I'm good. Are you still at Petunia's?

13:38.517 --> 13:39.952
- I am, thank you very much for asking,

13:40.019 --> 13:41.187
but, you know, who knows what's gonna happen

13:41.287 --> 13:42.321
after all this, right?

13:42.388 --> 13:44.623
- Yeah. Right. God.

13:44.690 --> 13:46.859
Yeah, I'm just glad we're in this together, right?

13:46.959 --> 13:50.362
- That is what I think. Thank you! Oh, my God.

13:50.462 --> 13:52.898
Anyway, can we please, just, like, you and me,

13:52.998 --> 13:55.167
can we get together for a coffee, finally?

13:55.234 --> 13:57.570
- 100%. I would love that. - Okay.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.305
- Yeah. - I can't believe it.

13:59.371 --> 14:01.907
I know this guy! Isn't this crazy?

14:02.007 --> 14:03.142
Oh, my God. -

14:03.209 --> 14:04.743
She's psycho. - Unbelievable.

14:07.012 --> 14:10.516
- Do you guys think that the world is gonna end?

14:10.583 --> 14:14.186
- No, Drew. Okay? No.

14:14.253 --> 14:17.423
We have, like, a whole government to protect us.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.825
- Plus, I think this thing isn't gonna move past Brooklyn.

14:19.892 --> 14:21.393
It's all these, like, rich bitches

14:21.493 --> 14:23.028
just passing it back and forth.

14:23.095 --> 14:25.564
- I don't know. This could be catastrophic.

14:26.732 --> 14:28.601
- You know what, guys?

14:28.701 --> 14:33.839
This is, like, the ultimate test

14:33.906 --> 14:35.541
to sort of trust

14:35.608 --> 14:37.409
that you're just in the exact right place

14:37.509 --> 14:41.280
that the universe wants you to be in, you know?

14:41.380 --> 14:42.848
- Mm-hmm.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.219
- Right, Dor?

14:52.925 --> 14:56.128
- Yeah.

14:56.228 --> 14:59.865
I don't know.

14:59.932 --> 15:02.034
I mean, how do you know anything?

15:05.571 --> 15:08.073
I just...

15:08.140 --> 15:11.744
I just-I just wanted to--

15:11.810 --> 15:15.648
I-I just--

15:15.748 --> 15:20.653
I just wanted to...

15:20.753 --> 15:24.657
I just...

15:24.757 --> 15:27.660
wanted...

16:32.491 --> 16:34.526
- Yeah!

16:34.626 --> 16:35.728
Brava! - Thank you.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.229
- Brava! - Thank you. Thank you.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.331
- So good. - You're all too kind.

16:39.398 --> 16:43.168
This performance is actually dedicated

16:43.235 --> 16:44.737
to Dory and Drew,

16:44.837 --> 16:46.405
who just tied the knot.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.708
Ah, seriously, you guys, I am so happy for you.

16:49.808 --> 16:53.078
I honestly couldn't even picture a better couple ever.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.714
- Aww, thanks, Porshe. That was beautiful.

16:55.814 --> 16:57.416
- Thank you. - And who else can say

16:57.516 --> 16:58.917
they have a wedding ring

16:59.018 --> 17:01.153
that's actually from the Natural History Museum?

17:01.220 --> 17:04.223
- Well, anything for my beautiful bride.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.326
- Hey. - Perfect.

17:07.393 --> 17:08.761
- Elliott.

17:14.533 --> 17:15.768
- I hate to say it, you guys,

17:15.868 --> 17:17.603
but I'm thinking about moving to LA.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.738
- What? - What? And leave me?

17:19.838 --> 17:21.273
- I mean, you all are killing it.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.076
You guys just got married. You're on Broadway.

17:24.176 --> 17:26.712
New York just doesn't feel like home anymore.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.581
I'm tired of seeing the same 13,000 people over and over.

17:29.681 --> 17:31.016
It just feels like high school.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.118
- Mm-hmm. - Yeah, but isn't LA smaller?

17:33.218 --> 17:34.453
It's, like, 11,000.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.288
- Yeah, but everyone knows about us here.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.623
I'm tired of being the subject

17:37.723 --> 17:39.458
of everyone's whispers, you know.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.627
- Well, if that's something that's gonna make you happy

17:41.727 --> 17:43.128
then you should explore that.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.464
Mm-hmm.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.866
- Hi. Hi.

17:55.541 --> 17:56.742
- Hi.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.047
Thank you.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.984
- Have a beautiful day.

18:14.159 --> 18:15.961
- Should we stay somewhere nice tonight?

18:16.061 --> 18:18.964
- Ooh, I just heard that they sanitized the Ritz.

18:19.064 --> 18:20.265
Maybe we could break in there.

18:20.332 --> 18:22.468
- Aww, have fun doing that,

18:22.568 --> 18:23.902
you two cuties.

18:23.969 --> 18:25.237
- Whoo! -

18:25.304 --> 18:27.172
- Let's go!

18:27.272 --> 18:28.574
- Is that Gail?

18:28.640 --> 18:31.009
- - Yeah.

18:32.578 --> 18:36.648
That's so sad. Guys, she was so cool.

18:36.748 --> 18:38.617
- She was.

18:53.465 --> 18:57.136
- Ugh, don't look. I hate that wall.

18:59.671 --> 19:03.642
- Yeah. It is what it is.
