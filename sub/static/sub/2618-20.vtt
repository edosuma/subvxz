00:05.727 --> 00:07.994
<i>Turn around
and raise your arms!</i>

00:08.061 --> 00:09.394
Hey, take it easy.

00:09.460 --> 00:10.594
Turn around!

00:10.661 --> 00:11.894
It wasn't us.
You got it wrong.

00:11.961 --> 00:13.061
Don't lie to me.

00:13.128 --> 00:14.961
If we took that money-
think about it-

00:15.028 --> 00:16.894
would we be standing here
with you?

00:16.961 --> 00:18.494
I said,
turn around!

00:18.560 --> 00:20.028
Don't shoot,
please!

00:20.094 --> 00:22.094
Put your hands up! We're
telling you the truth.

00:44.727 --> 00:47.861
Oh, man, check this out.

00:53.994 --> 00:56.293
Everyone came
through here.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.627
Sinatra,
his Rat Pack...

00:57.694 --> 01:00.394
Yeah, I know, Capone.
Fascinating.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.394
Look, we're running out
of room in my truck.

01:02.460 --> 01:04.061
And that light
in the window-

01:04.128 --> 01:06.761
that's the sun.

01:10.227 --> 01:12.694
Look at the gold leafing
on these pillars.

01:12.761 --> 01:14.761
We can't take the
pillars, Wayno.

01:14.827 --> 01:17.494
New owner will
strip it down,

01:17.560 --> 01:20.028
slap a coat of white gloss
over the whole thing.

01:20.094 --> 01:21.994
At least it'd brighten
this place up.

01:22.061 --> 01:24.694
This place gives me
the creeps.

01:24.761 --> 01:27.260
Hey, check behind
the concierge desk.

01:27.327 --> 01:29.160
There might be
some cool stuff.

01:43.227 --> 01:44.927
There's nothing back here.

01:54.761 --> 01:58.527
TJ, you okay?

02:01.761 --> 02:03.360
TJ?

02:37.694 --> 02:39.227
Deep breaths.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.961
Hang in there, sir.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.427
Frank.

02:48.494 --> 02:51.061
Both guys were shot
in the back of the head.

02:51.128 --> 02:52.927
Execution-style.

02:52.994 --> 02:55.293
One rots, one lives-
for now.

02:55.360 --> 02:56.427
IDs?

02:56.494 --> 02:57.594
They're brothers.

02:57.661 --> 02:58.994
Mariano and Garcia
Vargas.

02:59.061 --> 03:00.160
And get this:

03:00.227 --> 03:01.927
They were both
packing. 45s.

03:01.994 --> 03:03.927
Both holstered.

03:03.994 --> 03:05.394
Those young kids
called it in.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.894
They, uh, Wayne Leonard
and Tom Jennings.

03:07.961 --> 03:10.160
Call themselves
urban explorers.

03:10.227 --> 03:12.494
Fancy label
for pilfering.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.827
Hotel was scheduled

03:13.894 --> 03:15.394
to be gutted
next week.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.527
Let's contact
the owner.

03:17.594 --> 03:19.427
The boys were inside
looking for souvenirs.

03:19.494 --> 03:20.694
Well...

03:20.761 --> 03:22.794
they found more than that.

04:23.408 --> 04:26.740
You going to visit that guy
in the hospital?

04:26.807 --> 04:28.141
Uh...

04:28.207 --> 04:29.974
<i>( clears throat ):
No comment.</i>

04:30.041 --> 04:32.174
Saw him go in the ambulance.
Head wound.

04:32.241 --> 04:33.907
Doubt you'll get anything
out of him.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.540
That's why we
rely on evidence,

04:35.607 --> 04:37.408
like his clothes
and his property.

04:37.474 --> 04:39.840
This building's the perfect
place for a cover-up.

04:39.907 --> 04:42.307
A cover-up. You're kidding.

04:42.374 --> 04:44.707
Anything in there's going
to be rubble soon.

04:44.774 --> 04:47.940
Erica, why are you looking
for a story in this?

04:48.007 --> 04:49.940
It's just another
day in Miami.

04:50.007 --> 04:51.807
Don't make this
bigger than it is.

04:51.874 --> 04:54.107
Bigger opens doors
for me in Atlanta.

04:54.174 --> 04:57.508
Yeah, well, fabricating stories
closes doors for you in Miami.

05:09.241 --> 05:12.241
Room conditions,
daylight cycle.

05:12.307 --> 05:14.573
How long you think
he's been in here?

05:14.640 --> 05:17.074
Well, my entomologist
will confirm.

05:17.141 --> 05:20.207
Based on the size
of this fly larvae,

05:20.274 --> 05:23.474
he's been here
almost three days.

05:25.707 --> 05:29.107
Entrance wound says
nine-mil or. 38.

05:29.174 --> 05:31.640
Through-and-through.

05:31.707 --> 05:34.141
Yeah, but through-and-through
to where?

05:34.207 --> 05:36.107
The direction
of this spatter means

05:36.174 --> 05:39.408
the round could be
all the way out in the street.

05:39.474 --> 05:41.508
The other victim had
a head wound, too,

05:41.573 --> 05:43.007
is that right?

05:43.074 --> 05:45.274
Yeah, but that bullet
isn't yours, Calleigh, honey.

05:45.341 --> 05:47.408
It went on an ambulance ride.

05:47.474 --> 05:49.474
He's critical.

05:49.573 --> 05:52.274
And you think he lasted
three days in here with him?

05:52.341 --> 05:54.374
Yeah. Based on his level
of dehydration,

05:54.441 --> 05:56.673
he went into the tub
at the same time.

05:56.740 --> 05:58.840
And he couldn't get out.

06:02.374 --> 06:05.374
<i>The maggots devoured
the infected tissue</i>

06:05.441 --> 06:06.940
<i>surrounding the entrance wound,</i>

06:07.007 --> 06:09.141
keeping it clean.

06:09.207 --> 06:11.274
And that's what kept him alive.

06:11.341 --> 06:13.807
That's amazing.

06:13.874 --> 06:18.573
I think he'd use other words
to describe it.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.607
<i>Listen,</i>

06:20.673 --> 06:22.940
I don't know either one
of these Vargas brothers.

06:23.007 --> 06:25.141
I bought this old
hotel with the idea

06:25.207 --> 06:27.341
that I would restore it
to its original glory.

06:27.408 --> 06:29.274
I noticed
that you, uh... that you have

06:29.341 --> 06:30.707
no security.

06:30.774 --> 06:33.207
My advisor told me
to quit blowing money on it.

06:33.274 --> 06:36.307
I figured there was nothing left
to steal, so I cut back.

06:36.374 --> 06:38.374
We're not talking
about somebody walking away

06:38.441 --> 06:40.274
with a couple
of lumpy mattresses.

06:40.341 --> 06:42.607
Someone took lives here.

06:42.673 --> 06:46.307
Listen, I understand,
but I cannot afford delays.

06:46.374 --> 06:49.508
My structural engineer says,
if I file for an extension now,

06:49.573 --> 06:51.974
I won't be cutting ribbon
in 11 months.

06:52.041 --> 06:54.707
Mm. I'm crying inside,
Mr. Suero.

06:54.774 --> 06:57.673
We'll need a list of employees
from your contractor.

06:57.740 --> 06:59.707
As well as everybody
on your payroll.

06:59.774 --> 07:01.241
We will...

07:01.307 --> 07:03.374
be in touch.

07:12.874 --> 07:15.940
This is Mariano
Vargas's condo.

07:18.141 --> 07:20.573
Looks like we weren't
the only ones interested

07:20.640 --> 07:22.907
in what the Vargas brothers
were doing.

07:22.974 --> 07:26.874
Background check says he and
Garcia were part-time janitors.

07:26.940 --> 07:30.573
A lot of bags here.

07:31.974 --> 07:34.840
What were they cleaning up
with these?

07:34.907 --> 07:36.207
Well, something
smells hinky.

07:36.274 --> 07:38.107
I'll run his
background.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.474
Looks like Mariano found work
that paid better.

07:52.408 --> 07:54.207
Take a look at this.

07:57.307 --> 07:59.807
Well, that's a nice chunk
of cabbage.

08:01.474 --> 08:04.307
He was hiding money.

08:04.374 --> 08:05.474
Yeah, but why?

08:05.540 --> 08:07.174
Illegal gambling, drugs?

08:07.241 --> 08:08.807
Never anything good.

08:08.874 --> 08:11.041
We found his van down
in the parking lot.

08:11.107 --> 08:12.508
We'll have
it impounded.

08:12.573 --> 08:15.508
Let me get this back to the lab,
see where it takes us.

08:24.374 --> 08:26.807
Hey, Calleigh.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.174
Hey.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.874
These the bills you
called me about?

08:29.940 --> 08:31.041
Yeah. I was wondering

08:31.107 --> 08:32.740
if you could run
the serial numbers.

08:32.807 --> 08:34.840
Sure. I'll run the plate
and stack numbers, too.

08:34.907 --> 08:36.508
See what comes up
in the system.

08:36.607 --> 08:38.974
Great. So, we're working
together on this one?

08:39.041 --> 08:40.241
You called, Cal.

08:40.307 --> 08:41.573
For an expert opinion.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.673
Do not try
and bigfoot my case.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.640
Is this the way
it's gonna be?

08:45.707 --> 08:47.107
What?

08:47.174 --> 08:49.740
From now on, you and I,
just 'cause I got engaged?

08:49.807 --> 08:51.141
It is not because
you got engaged.

08:51.207 --> 08:52.573
It is because
you didn't tell me.

08:52.640 --> 08:53.940
I was looking for
the right time.

08:54.007 --> 08:55.940
There is no right time.
You just have to stand

08:56.007 --> 08:57.840
and deliver.

08:57.907 --> 09:00.807
So, do you think
you can find anything else

09:00.874 --> 09:03.640
off these bills?

09:03.707 --> 09:06.874
Okay, my hundred-dollar
bill, all right?

09:06.940 --> 09:09.974
Must be nice to work
for the feds.

09:11.007 --> 09:12.840
You see the difference?

09:12.907 --> 09:15.707
Yeah the portrait of
Benjamin Franklin's bigger.

09:15.774 --> 09:16.874
Mm-hmm. That's not all.

09:19.107 --> 09:20.241
You see the gray

09:20.307 --> 09:22.307
100 in the bottom left corner
of the bill?

09:22.374 --> 09:23.474
Yeah.

09:23.540 --> 09:24.707
It's not gray.

09:24.774 --> 09:26.640
It's actually the text
USA100 imbedded

09:26.707 --> 09:29.207
a classified number of times
within the bill.

09:29.274 --> 09:32.474
That's a nice security feature
to prevent counterfeiting.

09:32.540 --> 09:33.874
It's called microprinting.

09:33.940 --> 09:36.041
Introduced in 1990
on this denomination.

09:36.107 --> 09:37.807
Now look at your
mystery bill.

09:46.141 --> 09:47.707
There's no
microprinting.

09:47.774 --> 09:49.640
Your bill's at
least 16 years old.

09:49.707 --> 09:52.174
Average hundred is normally
in circulation for only nine.

09:52.241 --> 09:54.007
So, how did these survive
the cut?

09:54.074 --> 09:55.408
These were kept
underground.

09:55.474 --> 09:58.007
I've seen this before
on drug cartel cases.

09:58.074 --> 10:00.107
You can't tell that
by looking at them.

10:00.174 --> 10:01.573
Can, too.
See the edges?

10:01.640 --> 10:04.408
They're frayed.
I noticed that.

10:04.474 --> 10:06.007
You're looking
at rat bites.

10:06.074 --> 10:07.241
Rat bites?

10:07.307 --> 10:08.974
Drug cartels have
a cash flow problem.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.174
Too much currency
to move,

10:10.241 --> 10:12.174
so while it sits,
waiting to be laundered,

10:12.241 --> 10:13.441
rats snack on it.

10:18.607 --> 10:20.107
Does it help us?

10:20.174 --> 10:23.241
Only if you have
something to compare it to.

10:23.307 --> 10:25.740
It's a start.

10:30.940 --> 10:34.041
The license plate on Mariano Vargas's
van turned up something today.

10:34.107 --> 10:36.807
A parking ticket in front of
Miami-Dade Bank three days ago.

10:36.874 --> 10:38.740
Three days ago? That's the
same day his brother died.

10:38.807 --> 10:39.940
You tell that to H?

10:40.007 --> 10:41.107
I'm gonna meet him
over at the bank

10:41.174 --> 10:42.274
for a little
knock-and-talk.

10:42.341 --> 10:43.673
All right. Well, look,
I can hook you up

10:43.740 --> 10:45.540
with some photos
of the hundred-dollar bills.

10:45.607 --> 10:47.807
Somebody's got
to start talking.

10:50.207 --> 10:52.074
Anybody try
to pass on this currency

10:52.141 --> 10:54.807
at your bank
that you know of?

10:54.874 --> 10:57.307
No. This is outdated.
It's damaged.

10:57.374 --> 10:59.474
We would have taken this note
out of circulation.

10:59.540 --> 11:01.474
Did someone tell you
it came from here?

11:01.540 --> 11:03.408
We recovered it
from Mariano Vargas's apartment.

11:03.474 --> 11:04.774
He got a parking ticket

11:04.840 --> 11:06.640
in front of your bank
three days ago.

11:06.707 --> 11:07.707
You recognize him?

11:07.774 --> 11:09.441
No, I don't.

11:09.508 --> 11:11.141
Anything out
of the ordinary happen

11:11.207 --> 11:12.774
that day around here?

11:12.840 --> 11:14.441
<i>Not in the bank, no.</i>

11:14.508 --> 11:16.874
Okay, well, how about
outside the bank?

11:16.940 --> 11:20.107
Well, a client's car got stolen
out by the ATM.

11:20.174 --> 11:21.707
What kind of a car?

11:21.774 --> 11:23.573
It was a, uh,

11:23.640 --> 11:26.007
a Corvette, I think. Red.

11:28.874 --> 11:30.740
It was a red Corvette.

11:30.807 --> 11:33.174
Did your security cameras
see anything?

11:33.241 --> 11:34.274
Unfortunately, no.

11:34.341 --> 11:35.907
Our ATM camera was down.

11:35.974 --> 11:38.274
It was actually scheduled
for service that afternoon.

11:38.341 --> 11:39.307
That's convenient.

11:39.374 --> 11:40.441
What are you insinuating?

11:40.508 --> 11:42.441
I am insinuating

11:42.508 --> 11:45.341
no one is telling us anything,
including you.

11:49.374 --> 11:51.707
Horatio said a red Corvette

11:51.774 --> 11:53.474
was stolen outside
Miami-Dade Bank.

11:53.540 --> 11:55.940
Yeah, I'm searching
the impound database.

11:56.774 --> 11:59.174
We got a match.

11:59.241 --> 12:01.874
Yeah, Leo and Sienna.
Remember them?

12:01.940 --> 12:03.707
That's the car they stole.

12:03.774 --> 12:06.107
We caught them on the drawbridge
with a bag of cash

12:06.174 --> 12:08.307
that same day
we got the two-fer.

12:08.374 --> 12:09.907
Don't make me shoot you.

12:16.374 --> 12:19.740
They're in County.
Prelim's in 23 days.

12:22.474 --> 12:23.640
Hello?

12:23.707 --> 12:25.274
Yeah, Wolfe.
It's Delko.

12:25.341 --> 12:28.207
Listen, pull the evidence box
on Leo Riggs and Sienna Stone.

12:28.274 --> 12:31.007
From the drawbridge? Yeah. I
think they might be connected

12:31.074 --> 12:32.640
to the shootings
at the Delgado Hotel.

12:32.707 --> 12:34.374
You got it.
Thanks.

12:34.441 --> 12:36.374
Thanks, Tripp.

12:37.807 --> 12:40.740
Okay, Leo and
Sienna's case.

12:40.807 --> 12:42.508
Yeah.

12:42.573 --> 12:43.840
What did we
recover from them?

12:43.907 --> 12:45.007
Uh...

12:45.074 --> 12:47.707
Nine-mil.

12:49.774 --> 12:52.374
The arrest report said
the gun was dirty.

12:52.441 --> 12:53.807
Could've been fired.

12:53.874 --> 12:57.107
What caliber gun was used
to shoot the Vargas brothers?

12:57.174 --> 13:00.341
.38 caliber,
or a nine-mil.

13:00.408 --> 13:02.774
And how much time between
the Corvette being stolen

13:02.840 --> 13:05.573
and Leo and Sienna surrendering
at the drawbridge?

13:05.640 --> 13:08.174
An hour and a half.

13:08.241 --> 13:10.241
That's plenty of time
to meet the Vargas brothers

13:10.307 --> 13:12.874
at the Delgado Hotel and
shoot them. Let's take a look

13:12.940 --> 13:14.807
at the money we
caught them with.

13:14.874 --> 13:16.241
$1,200. Rest was donated

13:16.307 --> 13:19.508
to the citizens
of Miami.

13:19.573 --> 13:21.474
Wait a minute.
What?

13:23.274 --> 13:24.740
Rat bites.

13:24.807 --> 13:26.740
What's that mean? It
means that Leo and Sienna

13:26.807 --> 13:29.207
were moving the same money
as the Vargas brothers.

13:49.141 --> 13:51.241
You two seem to have an
incredibly calm disposition,

13:51.307 --> 13:53.141
almost like you've been
through this before.

13:53.207 --> 13:56.041
Well, Sienna and I aren't very
good at staying out of trouble.

13:56.107 --> 13:57.907
Seems to follow us
wherever we go.

13:57.974 --> 13:59.474
Having to return
for a preliminary hearing-

13:59.540 --> 14:00.840
does that change anything
for you?

14:00.907 --> 14:04.174
We'll need one of those
appointment books, I guess.

14:06.074 --> 14:09.174
That's all for now.
Back to you in the newsroom.

14:09.241 --> 14:11.174
And we're clear.

14:12.341 --> 14:13.974
Another roadblock.

14:14.041 --> 14:16.074
We just have a question.

14:16.141 --> 14:18.573
They've been released on bail,
haven't they? I mean, we were live.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.740
Get that microphone
out of here now.

14:20.807 --> 14:22.241
Okay, fine.

14:22.307 --> 14:24.274
Just don't start doing
the badge thing.

14:25.974 --> 14:28.673
We're off to the Fairmark.
Can we do this there?

14:28.740 --> 14:30.573
A couple mojitos
may warm your blood.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.540
What do you say?
We'll pass.

14:32.607 --> 14:34.774
The cash we caught you
with on the drawbridge-

14:34.840 --> 14:35.974
where'd it come from?

14:36.041 --> 14:38.107
What's it matter?
We gave it all away.

14:38.174 --> 14:40.408
What? You don't
watch the news?

14:40.474 --> 14:43.707
Mariano and Garcia Vargas.
You know them?

14:43.774 --> 14:45.540
No, sorry.

14:45.607 --> 14:48.940
I can't say we do.
So... we good?

14:49.007 --> 14:51.241
They were shot
at the Delgado Hotel.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.241
One's in surgery.
The other's dead.

14:53.307 --> 14:55.640
So, no, we're not good.

14:55.707 --> 14:59.573
Such a violent city- Miami.

14:59.640 --> 15:02.107
Protecting it must
be such a burden.

15:02.174 --> 15:04.874
You get off work, come meet us
at the bar, okay?

15:09.074 --> 15:10.707
They're tied to this.

15:10.774 --> 15:12.874
Well, we have their gun
from the drawbridge.

15:12.940 --> 15:15.007
We just don't have
anything to match it to.

15:15.074 --> 15:17.907
See if Mariano Vargas is out of
surgery. We need that bullet.

15:17.974 --> 15:19.840
I'll find it.

15:21.874 --> 15:24.874
Hey! Come here for a second.
I want to talk to you.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.041
Do you realize
what you're doing?

15:31.107 --> 15:32.740
What am I doing?

15:32.807 --> 15:35.307
These people are into something.

15:35.374 --> 15:36.408
Cartel money,

15:36.474 --> 15:37.907
murder.

15:37.974 --> 15:39.540
They're dangerous.

15:39.607 --> 15:40.907
What cartel?
What kind of drugs?

15:40.974 --> 15:42.573
I haven't gotten it
out of them yet.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.508
Erica, this isn't a game show.

15:45.573 --> 15:47.774
You could be putting
yourself in harm's way.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.307
This is my career.

15:49.374 --> 15:51.508
It could be your life.

16:07.108 --> 16:08.208
H.

16:08.273 --> 16:09.507
You go to the hospital?

16:09.574 --> 16:11.907
Yeah, just got back.
You get the bullet?

16:11.974 --> 16:13.741
No. They can't give it to us.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.074
The surgeon says it's
a nine-millimeter round,

16:16.141 --> 16:18.440
and it's the only thing
keeping Mariano Vargas alive.

16:18.507 --> 16:20.707
They pull it out of him,
he's gonna bleed to death.

16:20.774 --> 16:23.174
The hospital did give me his
clothes and his personal property.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.941
I was gonna run it
over to Trace.

16:25.007 --> 16:28.307
Okay, before you do, go back to
the hotel and get the second bullet.

16:28.373 --> 16:31.307
Through-and-through that
killed Garcia. That's the one.

16:39.741 --> 16:41.974
I thought Peter Elliott
was helping us.

16:42.041 --> 16:44.041
He is. At my request.

16:44.108 --> 16:46.741
Doesn't want to get
his, uh, pretty suit dirty?

16:46.807 --> 16:48.841
Where is he?
I don't know.

16:48.907 --> 16:51.340
Maybe he's e-mailing
Quantico...

16:51.407 --> 16:53.440
having lunch
with his fiancee...

16:53.507 --> 16:56.540
Any luck finding the
bullet on the street?

16:56.607 --> 16:58.707
Oh, a couple guys
with metal detectors.

16:58.774 --> 17:00.941
We're striking out.

17:01.007 --> 17:03.741
Well...

17:03.807 --> 17:06.406
we know it has to be
on this end of the room,

17:06.473 --> 17:08.607
because the direction of the
blood spatter on the sink

17:08.674 --> 17:12.007
<i>means the round would have
had to travel that way.</i>

17:24.240 --> 17:26.406
Maybe it never made it outside.

17:26.473 --> 17:30.141
There's a dust void.

17:30.208 --> 17:34.208
I think the bullet hit
whatever was here.

17:34.273 --> 17:37.007
Those teenagers combing
through this place.

17:37.074 --> 17:40.407
I think I'll find out
what they went home with.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.507
How long have you
been doing this?

17:46.574 --> 17:50.174
Uh... about a year.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.941
You call yourself an urban explorer,
but you do realize you're a thief.

17:54.007 --> 17:56.474
Look, nobody
wants this stuff.

17:56.540 --> 17:58.707
If they did, it wouldn't
just be lying around.

17:58.774 --> 18:02.373
It's still private property,
Wayne. Think about it.

18:17.774 --> 18:20.340
Is this from the Delgado Hotel?

18:20.407 --> 18:22.874
Yeah, it's a Royal Quiet Deluxe.

18:22.941 --> 18:25.507
1952 model;
I grabbed it

18:25.574 --> 18:27.007
before the cops came.

18:35.074 --> 18:37.807
The model comes with a bullet.

18:39.941 --> 18:42.774
Is it new or old?

18:46.574 --> 18:48.240
It's old enough.

19:14.574 --> 19:16.607
Calleigh?

19:16.674 --> 19:18.741
The typewriter round's
pretty mangled.

19:18.807 --> 19:21.540
Too mangled to work with?

19:21.607 --> 19:24.474
I had enough to tell that
the striations didn't match.

19:24.540 --> 19:27.741
So, Leo and Sienna's gun
from the drawbridge

19:27.807 --> 19:30.907
<i>was not used on the
Vargas brothers. Correct.</i>

19:30.974 --> 19:33.674
They didn't kill them, but they
did have some of their money.

19:33.741 --> 19:35.373
I don't know.
Maybe they were couriers.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.607
Okay, it's time
to pay them a visit.

19:55.007 --> 19:57.273
Come on, guys.

19:57.340 --> 19:59.174
We only have four minutes
till our live shot.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.141
How do I look?

20:01.208 --> 20:03.273
Composition's better if your
heads are closer together.

20:03.340 --> 20:05.474
Is it better if I
move in like this?

20:07.907 --> 20:09.507
Hello.

20:09.574 --> 20:11.640
What are you doing here?

20:11.707 --> 20:14.307
Well, Leo and Sienna mentioned
mojitos at the Fairmark.

20:14.373 --> 20:16.640
Nobody said anything
about the penthouse suite.

20:16.707 --> 20:19.108
Other markets want a piece
of the action now.

20:21.841 --> 20:24.108
So, you're hiding them.

20:24.174 --> 20:25.941
I have to keep them under wraps

20:26.007 --> 20:28.807
if I want to have
creative control over my story.

20:28.874 --> 20:30.607
I already warned you about this.

20:30.674 --> 20:33.273
Listen, Ryan: this is
gonna get me on cable news.

20:33.340 --> 20:35.007
Looks like you're set
up for an exclusive.

20:35.074 --> 20:37.474
Look at the ratings.
They've tripled in three days.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.507
People are launching Leo and
Sienna Web sites. It's huge.

20:44.774 --> 20:46.707
Stay down, stay down!

20:51.741 --> 20:53.307
Is everybody okay?

20:55.407 --> 20:56.841
You see muzzle flash
out there?

20:56.907 --> 20:58.741
No. Nothing.
Shooter could be anywhere.

20:58.807 --> 21:02.474
This is CSI Duquesne. We've got
shots fired at the Fairmark Hotel.

21:02.540 --> 21:04.240
Requesting immediate backup.

21:08.141 --> 21:09.874
Erica.

21:11.707 --> 21:14.474
Erica?

21:14.540 --> 21:16.874
They say I have to go
to the ER. Am I...?

21:16.941 --> 21:19.373
They just want to make sure
they got all the glass out.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.874
But the EMT says
you're fine.

21:20.941 --> 21:23.208
You're dying to say
"I told you so," aren't you?

21:23.273 --> 21:25.108
No. I'm not. I'm just
glad it wasn't worse.

21:25.174 --> 21:26.874
Maybe I'm crazy,
but for a big story,

21:26.941 --> 21:29.273
I don't mind a little
flesh wound. You are crazy.

21:29.340 --> 21:32.108
You got a nail through your eye
on a case. How's that different?

21:32.174 --> 21:34.108
Well, for one thing,
Erica, I'm a cop.

21:34.174 --> 21:35.707
Get to the hospital.

21:40.941 --> 21:42.707
Who's trying to kill you, Leo?

21:42.774 --> 21:46.507
<i>I was hoping
you could tell us.</i>

21:46.574 --> 21:48.741
It's gotta be
some crazed groupie.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.507
We have a huge fan base.

21:50.574 --> 21:54.240
This is not a fan. You threw somebody
else's money off the drawbridge.

21:54.307 --> 21:56.941
And now they're coming
to get you.

21:57.007 --> 22:00.440
When Sienna and I stole that
car, the money was already in it.

22:00.507 --> 22:03.041
And that's as far
as our story goes.

22:03.108 --> 22:06.607
Leo, in my humble opinion,
you're over your head.

22:06.674 --> 22:09.407
Well, that's all I got.

22:09.474 --> 22:12.907
Until you find something more-
nice knowing ya.

22:12.974 --> 22:17.307
I am offering you
police protection right now.

22:20.674 --> 22:22.540
I'll take my chances.

22:22.607 --> 22:24.741
You're making a mistake.

22:28.440 --> 22:29.874
You done, Leo?

22:29.941 --> 22:31.340
We're outta here.

22:33.674 --> 22:35.574
Sonny and Cher
came into this city

22:35.640 --> 22:36.774
with the clothes on their back.

22:36.841 --> 22:38.208
When we arrested them,

22:38.273 --> 22:40.240
all they had
was a gun and that bag of money.

22:40.307 --> 22:41.507
What about the car?

22:41.574 --> 22:43.407
PD tow yard
released it yesterday.

22:43.474 --> 22:44.741
To who?

22:44.807 --> 22:46.774
Back to the registered owner.
Okay, Frank,

22:46.841 --> 22:49.007
bring him in here
before somebody else dies.

22:57.127 --> 22:58.493
Danny Harper,

22:58.560 --> 23:00.261
you're the registered
owner of a car

23:00.328 --> 23:01.261
that's been
pretty busy lately.

23:01.328 --> 23:03.261
Danny...

23:03.328 --> 23:05.460
are you involved in this?

23:05.527 --> 23:08.227
Involved in what?
Look, this whole

23:08.294 --> 23:10.927
Leo and Sienna thing on the
news- it doesn't involve me.

23:10.994 --> 23:13.593
Police report said you left
the keys in the ignition

23:13.660 --> 23:14.994
outside the bank.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.328
Did you leave your brain
in the glove compartment, too?

23:17.394 --> 23:21.527
I mean, who does that?

23:21.593 --> 23:23.860
All right.

23:23.927 --> 23:27.493
Look, I just couldn't keep up
with the payments.

23:27.560 --> 23:29.227
So you wanted to ditch
the vehicle.

23:29.294 --> 23:32.527
Figured I'd collect some
insurance, cut my losses.

23:42.527 --> 23:43.894
And it happened real quick.

23:43.961 --> 23:45.394
You know, corner of my eye,

23:45.460 --> 23:48.127
I see this couple
approaching down the sidewalk.

23:54.627 --> 23:56.294
You put it on a platter, man.

23:56.361 --> 23:58.428
Have a nice day!

23:59.894 --> 24:01.961
It was supposed to just
disappear, right?

24:02.027 --> 24:04.294
I mean, that's what happens
when a car gets stolen.

24:04.361 --> 24:06.527
Mine ends up on
the Leo and Sienna show-

24:06.593 --> 24:08.827
drawbridges and flying money.

24:08.894 --> 24:11.161
That money came
from your car.

24:11.227 --> 24:14.094
If I had a bag of cash
sitting in my car,

24:14.161 --> 24:16.094
why would I be stopping
at an ATM?

24:16.161 --> 24:18.927
<i>They grabbed a bag out of a van
parked near my car.</i>

24:18.994 --> 24:20.027
You wanna?

24:20.094 --> 24:22.860
I don't wanna go there no more.

24:22.927 --> 24:24.593
You don't even know
what's in there.

24:24.660 --> 24:26.361
We're in front
of a bank, baby.

24:26.428 --> 24:28.161
Let's take one and find out. I love you.

24:37.061 --> 24:39.294
Danny...

24:39.361 --> 24:42.660
the bag that Leo was carrying
was heavy, wasn't it?

24:42.727 --> 24:44.894
He was struggling with it, yeah.

24:44.961 --> 24:46.194
Units on the scene said Sienna

24:46.261 --> 24:48.261
was waving the bag
all over the place.

24:51.894 --> 24:54.394
Which means we're missing
a whole lot of dough.

24:54.460 --> 24:56.094
Yes, it does-
back to the car.

25:58.927 --> 26:01.593
I know where the rest of Leo
and Sienna's money went.

26:01.660 --> 26:03.794
Both door panels
were pulled and stuffed.

26:03.860 --> 26:06.394
There's got to be over
a million dollars there, Eric,

26:06.460 --> 26:09.261
stashed before they
got to the drawbridge.

26:32.261 --> 26:33.860
Maybe they were going
to come back for the car

26:33.927 --> 26:35.227
after it got released
from the impound.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.493
But we beat them
to it, Eric.

26:37.560 --> 26:38.994
Looks like it was
munched by rats.

26:39.061 --> 26:40.161
It's probably cartel money.

26:40.227 --> 26:41.660
They're safer without it.

26:41.727 --> 26:44.361
Not if the shooter
thinks they still have it.

26:53.328 --> 26:55.361
Hey.

26:55.428 --> 26:58.027
Hey. Is that the one of the
rounds from the penthouse?

26:58.094 --> 27:00.994
I pulled it out of the wall
after EMT took Erica away.

27:01.061 --> 27:02.894
Is she still at the
hospital? I doubt it.

27:02.961 --> 27:05.460
She thinks this story's going
to take her to cable news.

27:05.527 --> 27:06.727
Well, it may.

27:06.794 --> 27:08.294
The gun used at the
Fairmark penthouse

27:08.361 --> 27:10.961
also fired the round
that killed Garcia Vargas

27:11.027 --> 27:13.294
that I pulled from
the typewriter.

27:13.361 --> 27:16.294
They match striations.

27:16.361 --> 27:18.094
The Vargas brothers paid
for the missing million

27:18.161 --> 27:20.027
with their lives.

27:20.094 --> 27:21.727
Leo and Sienna
are going to be next..

27:21.794 --> 27:23.227
So, what do
you want to do?

27:23.294 --> 27:25.694
Chase Leo and Sienna
or who's after them?

27:25.760 --> 27:28.493
I think we need to find
the source of that cash.

27:28.560 --> 27:31.194
The camera at the ATM
at the bank was out of order.

27:31.261 --> 27:32.361
Could have been helpful.

27:34.527 --> 27:37.394
Mariano had a parking ticket
in front of Miami-Dade Bank.

27:37.460 --> 27:38.860
What about the
parking meters?

27:38.927 --> 27:41.660
Aren't they testing the
new ones at 23rd Street?

27:43.460 --> 27:46.328
<i>Prototype parking meter
looks like a gas pump.</i>

27:52.627 --> 27:55.493
Photo Violation Meter-
it's brand-new.

27:55.560 --> 27:56.593
I pulled these shots

27:56.660 --> 28:00.827
off of Violation Link.

28:00.894 --> 28:03.560
That's Garcia Vargas
carrying the bags.

28:03.627 --> 28:04.727
Yeah, but take a look.

28:04.794 --> 28:06.961
He wasn't taking them
into the bank.

28:07.027 --> 28:09.694
He's loading them
in the van.

28:13.460 --> 28:18.061
Horatio's going to want to have
another chat with our banker.

28:20.560 --> 28:22.227
Mr. Adams, Leo Riggs
and Sienna Stone

28:22.294 --> 28:26.094
stole a million dollars
in drug profits from this bank.

28:26.161 --> 28:29.961
I can't say anything.
I can't. I...

28:30.027 --> 28:32.361
You got to understand.

28:32.428 --> 28:35.261
He will kill my family.

28:35.328 --> 28:39.294
I do understand, so protect
your family and talk to me.

28:41.328 --> 28:45.994
I had a deal with...
Nicolas Suero.

28:47.027 --> 28:49.593
Owner of the Delgado Hotel.

28:52.194 --> 28:55.361
Yeah, he sells his
US currency to me.

28:55.428 --> 28:58.294
I convert them into pesos
for his family in Colombia.

28:58.361 --> 28:59.827
And you deposit
his US currency

28:59.894 --> 29:00.961
in Florida bank accounts.

29:01.027 --> 29:03.328
Makes him a rich man
in two countries.

29:03.394 --> 29:05.760
Money laundering
in the new millennium.

29:05.827 --> 29:07.961
Yes. Why was the money taken
out of this bank?

29:08.027 --> 29:10.294
I was getting paranoid.

29:10.361 --> 29:12.660
I didn't want to get caught
around bad money, so I asked him

29:12.727 --> 29:15.894
to send his guys over
to get the money out of here.

29:15.961 --> 29:17.794
Okay. And that's all you know?

29:17.860 --> 29:19.593
Yes, that's all I
know, and I swear.

29:19.660 --> 29:22.493
I need you guys to understand
something: Suero, he means...

29:22.560 --> 29:23.994
he means what he says.

29:24.061 --> 29:26.294
So do I.

29:28.127 --> 29:30.261
Nicolas, I guess dirty money
is a way

29:30.328 --> 29:32.328
into the real estate
business, huh?

29:33.894 --> 29:36.527
Doesn't matter
how hard you work,

29:36.593 --> 29:38.027
in this community,
you get labeled.

29:38.094 --> 29:39.361
Here's what I'm after,
Nicolas:

29:39.428 --> 29:42.694
Two men under your employ
were shot at your hotel.

29:42.760 --> 29:46.094
I want to know if you pulled
the trigger, Nicolas.

29:46.161 --> 29:47.660
Why would I do
something like that?

29:47.727 --> 29:50.560
It works against everything
that I'm trying to achieve.

29:52.328 --> 29:54.860
Look... I'm an idealist.

29:54.927 --> 29:57.694
This hotel will breath life
into our city,

29:57.760 --> 29:59.361
return some of its old luster...

29:59.428 --> 30:02.560
Yes, and launder
your drug money.

30:06.127 --> 30:07.694
Okay.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.860
Call me when you
prove any of this.

30:09.927 --> 30:11.294
It's been a real
pleasure, Lieutenant.

30:11.361 --> 30:12.794
Nicolas?

30:12.860 --> 30:14.760
Don't go far.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.027
Eric.

30:20.094 --> 30:23.194
H, I analyzed the stain
on Mariano Vargas's shirt

30:23.261 --> 30:24.760
that Ryan got
from the hospital.

30:39.827 --> 30:42.027
What did you get?

30:42.094 --> 30:43.294
All I got was
some kind of transfer:

30:43.361 --> 30:44.627
it's an aromatic hydrocarbon,

30:44.694 --> 30:47.660
tri-methyl benzene
and an ultraviolet dye.

30:47.727 --> 30:48.927
An ink.

30:48.994 --> 30:50.294
Yeah, it's from a UV pen.

30:50.361 --> 30:51.727
Banks tend to use them

30:51.794 --> 30:53.294
to sign documents,
prevent forgeries.

30:53.361 --> 30:54.493
And to track money.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.827
This bank manager
is bad news.

30:56.894 --> 30:58.194
What's this about?

30:58.261 --> 30:59.361
Lieutenant Caine?

30:59.428 --> 31:00.894
What's going on?

31:00.961 --> 31:03.094
I have more to discuss
with you, Mr. Adams.

31:03.161 --> 31:04.460
Don't know what else
I can tell you.

31:04.527 --> 31:07.094
We'll take it from here,
Lieutenant.

31:08.527 --> 31:10.460
Agent Elliott,
what are you doing?

31:10.527 --> 31:12.227
Department of Treasury
is closing the bank.

31:12.294 --> 31:14.460
$15 million in fraudulent loans
to land developers

31:14.527 --> 31:16.527
in Florida and Louisiana
in the last two years,

31:16.593 --> 31:18.328
fake socials, the works.

31:18.394 --> 31:19.694
FinCEN and the SEC
are involved.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.094
You almost tipped
the whole thing.

31:21.161 --> 31:23.127
A heads-up would have
been appreciated.

31:23.194 --> 31:24.961
Too many singing canaries
in your lab, Horatio.

31:25.027 --> 31:26.493
I am going to examine

31:26.560 --> 31:28.394
everything that you seize-
do you understand?

31:28.460 --> 31:30.627
What we've uncovered
in the last three years...

31:30.694 --> 31:33.394
he'll do more federal time than
he ever will for your murder.

31:33.460 --> 31:35.593
Why don't we let a court
decide that?

31:35.660 --> 31:38.061
I'll direct your request
to my superiors.

31:44.261 --> 31:45.994
What the hell
happened?

31:46.061 --> 31:47.261
I'm not sure.

31:47.328 --> 31:48.827
Well, I got another
one for you.

31:48.894 --> 31:51.894
Leo and Sienna just robbed a
convenience store near Vizcaya.

31:51.961 --> 31:55.593
That's right: you're being
robbed by Leo and Sienna.

31:57.527 --> 31:59.127
Open the cash drawer.

32:01.460 --> 32:03.493
Took off with a few
thousand dollars,

32:03.560 --> 32:05.560
and a civilian
helped them get away.

32:05.627 --> 32:07.493
-Now, do you
believe that?
- I'm afraid I do.

32:13.727 --> 32:15.261
What's going on?

32:15.328 --> 32:17.094
WFOR. Sikes is
back on the hunt.

32:17.401 --> 32:18.668
Great.

32:18.733 --> 32:20.034
So Leo and Sienna asked

32:20.100 --> 32:21.867
if they could stay with you? Yeah.

32:21.934 --> 32:24.833
Were you aware that they
just robbed a convenience store?

32:24.900 --> 32:27.867
No. I was just kind of
excited to meet them.

32:27.934 --> 32:29.534
So you heard the shot?

32:29.601 --> 32:33.800
Sounded like a gunshot.
Uh, I heard tires squealing.

32:33.867 --> 32:35.967
Came outside.
Saw that my car was gone.

32:36.034 --> 32:38.401
Whose Cadillac
is this in your driveway?

32:38.467 --> 32:39.668
I have no idea.

32:39.733 --> 32:42.568
My silver BMW was gone,
and it was there.

32:42.634 --> 32:44.634
It's not mine.

32:44.700 --> 32:47.434
And yet another disappearing act
for Leo and Sienna.

32:47.501 --> 32:49.034
They're on the run again.

32:49.100 --> 32:52.234
This is Erica Sikes
reporting live for CBS 4 News.

32:52.301 --> 32:55.867
He heard gunfire.

32:55.934 --> 32:58.401
They should have
found them.

32:58.467 --> 33:01.167
Leo and Sienna are
in a silver BMW convertible.

33:01.234 --> 33:02.568
What about
the Cadillac?

33:02.634 --> 33:05.167
It's registered
to Nicolas Suero.

33:05.234 --> 33:07.267
Well, how do
you like that?

33:07.334 --> 33:08.668
Why would he
leave his car?

33:08.733 --> 33:11.767
Because maybe...
maybe he ended up

33:11.833 --> 33:13.668
on the wrong end
of the stick.

33:13.733 --> 33:15.867
Find them.
I'm on it.

33:24.434 --> 33:25.867
Agent Elliott.

33:25.934 --> 33:27.568
Found some documentation
that may connect

33:27.634 --> 33:30.167
your banker Jason Adams
to your Colombian Suero.

33:30.234 --> 33:31.401
I'm still wrestling

33:31.467 --> 33:32.934
with the Inspector
General for them.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.467
Thought you might want to take
a look at this in the meantime.

33:35.534 --> 33:36.733
A nine-mil.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.733
That is what
we're looking for.

33:38.800 --> 33:39.967
Found in his briefcase.

33:40.034 --> 33:41.434
He was obviously surprised
to see us.

33:41.501 --> 33:44.434
Okay, I need to search
his residence now.

33:44.501 --> 33:46.100
It's all yours.
What's over there?

33:46.167 --> 33:48.134
Another surprise.

33:48.201 --> 33:50.100
What, what's that?

33:50.167 --> 33:52.534
That is the gun that
killed Garcia Vargas

33:52.601 --> 33:55.334
and put his brother
in a coma, Jason.

33:55.401 --> 33:58.634
We found it
in your briefcase.

34:00.700 --> 34:02.267
I didn't kill anybody.

34:02.334 --> 34:04.900
Suero gave that to me.
Told me to hide it.

34:04.967 --> 34:06.967
Yeah, not quite.

34:09.634 --> 34:12.301
Laundry- that's interesting.

34:12.367 --> 34:13.733
That shirt was found
at your house.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.000
Ink from a UV pen
stained the breast pocket.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.501
So what?

34:27.568 --> 34:29.467
That same ink was transferred
to Mariano Vargas.

34:29.534 --> 34:32.000
And it puts you at the scene.

34:32.067 --> 34:34.967
So let's start talking.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.833
I told Suero to
come get his money,

34:40.900 --> 34:42.833
to get it
out of there.

34:42.900 --> 34:44.668
Then he sends those
two goons over there.

34:44.733 --> 34:48.201
Mariano and Garcia
delivered it to Suero

34:48.266 --> 34:49.601
a million
dollars short.

34:49.668 --> 34:51.266
You thought
they stole the money.

34:51.333 --> 34:53.501
When Suero calls me and
tells me he's a mil short.

34:53.568 --> 34:54.601
Yes, I did.

34:54.668 --> 34:55.867
So I told Mariano
and Vargas

34:55.934 --> 34:58.201
to meet me at the Delgado Hotel.

34:58.267 --> 35:00.301
Look, don't lie to me,
all right? Don't!

35:00.367 --> 35:02.634
It was all there when
you left my bank!

35:02.700 --> 35:03.967
Wasn't us.
You got it wrong.

35:04.034 --> 35:05.467
If we took that money-

35:05.534 --> 35:09.067
think about it- would we
be standing here with you?

35:12.100 --> 35:14.601
They look at me
straight in the eye,

35:14.668 --> 35:17.934
tell me they had
nothing to do with it.

35:18.967 --> 35:20.833
Turn around.

35:20.900 --> 35:22.201
Turn around!

35:23.867 --> 35:25.733
Now put your
hands up!

35:41.134 --> 35:44.067
So killing them
at the Delgado Hotel,

35:44.134 --> 35:45.301
leaving them in the bathtub,

35:45.367 --> 35:47.534
that was all a plan
to set up Suero?

35:47.601 --> 35:49.967
Suero threatens
every member of my family,

35:50.034 --> 35:52.234
tells me he's going
to kill them one at a time

35:52.301 --> 35:53.668
if I don't get
his mil back.

35:53.733 --> 35:56.201
After they lied
to my face,

35:56.267 --> 35:59.568
I go to Mariano's condo
and I turn it upside down.

36:09.267 --> 36:11.900
It's not there.

36:11.967 --> 36:14.700
And when we came to visit you
at the bank you realized

36:14.767 --> 36:18.367
that Sienna and Leo
had Suero's money, right?

36:18.434 --> 36:20.501
I saw them on television.

36:20.568 --> 36:22.267
And I couldn't get near them.

36:22.334 --> 36:24.634
But you got close enough, Jason.

36:36.767 --> 36:40.568
My life is
in serious danger over this.

36:40.634 --> 36:43.301
They're ordering room service
at the Fairmark penthouse.

36:45.668 --> 36:48.067
I wasn't going to let them
get away with it.

36:48.134 --> 36:51.334
They didn't get away with it,
Jason.

36:51.401 --> 36:54.034
And neither will you.

37:07.800 --> 37:10.167
The stolen BMW has a SunPass.

37:10.234 --> 37:11.967
Finally we get a break.
Can we use that?

37:12.034 --> 37:13.967
Yeah. Cooper says
he got the court order.

37:14.034 --> 37:15.568
That'll tell us where
they're headed, at least.

37:15.634 --> 37:18.334
<i>Yeah, data's coming in. Okay.</i>

37:18.401 --> 37:21.034
SunPass recorded a paid toll
at Golden Glades Toll Plaza.

37:21.100 --> 37:22.367
It's headed east.

37:27.568 --> 37:29.434
I guess
they're leaving the state.

37:29.501 --> 37:31.601
All of Monroe County
is gonna be standing by

37:31.668 --> 37:32.967
when they get through.

37:34.167 --> 37:35.900
Is that them?

37:37.367 --> 37:38.501
Yeah.

37:53.767 --> 37:54.867
Leo...

37:54.934 --> 37:56.301
it's time.

37:56.367 --> 37:58.668
We're going to
make history.

38:27.100 --> 38:29.034
Drop the weapon!
Drop the bag!

38:29.100 --> 38:30.401
Put your hands in the air!

38:43.733 --> 38:45.733
I love you, baby.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.367
I love you, Leo.

40:02.700 --> 40:04.167
Suspects have jumped the bridge.

40:04.234 --> 40:06.100
Requesting water recovery.

40:35.067 --> 40:38.668
Suero came looking
for his million.

40:38.733 --> 40:40.601
It proves Leo and Sienna
are crazy.

40:40.668 --> 40:42.833
They killed a cartel boss.

41:08.401 --> 41:10.601
Hey, you okay?

41:10.668 --> 41:12.034
Field agent told me about

41:12.100 --> 41:14.000
the Leo and Sienna thing
on the bridge. Crazy stuff.

41:14.067 --> 41:15.833
Word travels fast.

41:15.900 --> 41:17.900
I'm surprised you're willing
to set foot in our lab

41:17.967 --> 41:20.234
with all the information
leaks around here.

41:20.301 --> 41:22.934
If you're referring
to our fraud case, I'm sorry.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.767
You knew that bank was
part of our investigation

41:24.833 --> 41:26.367
and you said nothing.
The bank closure was

41:26.434 --> 41:27.700
in front of a judge.

41:27.767 --> 41:28.900
If ownership found out,
they could've blocked it.

41:28.967 --> 41:30.434
There was too much
at stake, Calleigh.

41:30.501 --> 41:31.767
We're on the same team.

41:31.833 --> 41:33.167
I know that.

41:33.234 --> 41:35.367
But right now, your lab
has a credibility problem.

41:35.434 --> 41:38.034
We have to be careful
until it blows over.

41:38.100 --> 41:40.367
I don't think
this is going to blow over.

41:40.434 --> 41:43.234
Every time I see you, there's
a new reason not to trust you.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.000
Excuse me.

41:55.601 --> 41:57.733
And so here in Miami,

41:57.800 --> 41:59.201
on the Riverton Bridge,

41:59.267 --> 42:02.234
the story of Leo and Sienna
comes to a tragic end.

42:02.301 --> 42:04.733
Erica Sikes.

42:06.767 --> 42:08.867
Lieutenant.

42:08.934 --> 42:10.367
Would you like
to add a comment?

42:10.434 --> 42:12.134
Turn it off.

42:15.267 --> 42:16.234
What do you want?

42:16.301 --> 42:18.900
I want the tapes
from the bridge.

42:18.967 --> 42:20.900
I can't do that.

42:20.967 --> 42:21.934
I have a responsibility

42:22.000 --> 42:23.134
to see
this story through.

42:23.201 --> 42:26.067
I have a responsibility
to this city.

42:26.134 --> 42:27.634
I didn't make them
do what they did.

42:27.700 --> 42:28.634
No, you didn't.

42:28.700 --> 42:30.934
But you glamorized it.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.634
Everyone wants to see
how this ends.

42:33.700 --> 42:35.434
And you're going
to be the first.

42:35.501 --> 42:37.134
I want the tape.

42:52.934 --> 42:55.134
I guess I'll see you
on the next crime scene.

42:59.067 --> 43:00.534
I'll be here.
