01:11.765 --> 01:12.867
Luke?

01:13.901 --> 01:15.469
Luke?

01:16.003 --> 01:17.438
Luke?

01:17.872 --> 01:18.907
Luke?

01:19.774 --> 01:20.876
Dad?

01:21.943 --> 01:23.377
Luke?

01:24.045 --> 01:25.647
Dad?

01:26.915 --> 01:28.350
Luke?

01:29.717 --> 01:30.819
Dad?

01:31.953 --> 01:33.455
Luke?

01:34.656 --> 01:37.659
God, please don't let my dad
leave me here.

01:38.793 --> 01:40.927
Did you have fun?
Did you swim?

01:40.929 --> 01:42.897
Hey, Luke, come on,
let's go, let's go.

01:42.899 --> 01:45.465
Dad, they're not gonna
start the game without me.

01:45.467 --> 01:47.500
Right.
Hey, where's your brother?

01:47.502 --> 01:49.502
I think he's in the other van.
I don't know.

01:49.504 --> 01:50.870
All right.

01:50.872 --> 01:54.877
Okay, seat belts on.
Let's go. We got a game to win.

02:13.562 --> 02:14.830
Hey!

02:17.099 --> 02:19.566
Yeah, I know.
Hey, come on out.

02:19.568 --> 02:20.969
Watch your step, okay?

02:20.971 --> 02:22.603
I need you to go pick him up.

02:22.605 --> 02:24.672
I can't believe you left him.

02:24.674 --> 02:27.275
I didn't leave him.
I thought he was in another van.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.710
<i>But I need you to go pick him up.
I have to take Luke to his game.</i>

02:29.712 --> 02:31.746
Oh, I've got him, hon.
I've got him.

02:31.748 --> 02:33.982
- Mom to the rescue...
- Again.

02:33.984 --> 02:35.116
<i>My hero.</i>

02:35.118 --> 02:36.719
I know. Bye.

02:44.861 --> 02:47.729
Hi. Hi. Oh, goodness.

02:47.731 --> 02:49.631
Oh, hey.

02:49.633 --> 02:52.934
Right through the middle.
Drive it down! Come on, Lukitus, yay!

02:52.936 --> 02:54.036
Let's go.

02:54.038 --> 02:55.505
Hey, buddy.

02:57.308 --> 02:59.040
You're a Bernard. You'll live.

02:59.042 --> 03:00.809
Hey.

03:00.811 --> 03:03.745
What? Don't hate, watch the game.
Watch the game.

03:03.747 --> 03:06.582
Drive, drive, drive,
come on, Lukitus!

03:06.584 --> 03:08.150
Come on, Lukitus!

03:08.152 --> 03:11.886
Yeah, Lukitus!

03:11.888 --> 03:15.091
Who's behind you, buddy?

03:15.093 --> 03:16.691
Goal!

03:16.693 --> 03:18.694
Look, Dad, look,
I just beat my high score!

03:18.696 --> 03:20.096
Yeah, that's great, pal,
that's great.

03:20.098 --> 03:21.666
Way to go, Luke!

03:22.633 --> 03:23.868
- Good job.
- Way to go, buddy!

03:26.104 --> 03:28.037
- Hello, kiddos.
- Hey, Mom.

03:28.039 --> 03:29.839
- Hi, Benjamin.
- Hi.

03:29.841 --> 03:31.674
Okay,
how was school today?

03:31.676 --> 03:33.709
Well, we got our report cards.

03:33.711 --> 03:35.678
Yes, and... how did we do?

03:35.680 --> 03:38.647
It looks like my math
tutoring has finally paid off.

03:38.649 --> 03:39.815
- Yeah?
- I got a B.

03:39.817 --> 03:42.019
Ooh, that's fabulous, honey!

03:42.021 --> 03:43.186
That's wonderful.

03:43.188 --> 03:45.055
Luke, how did you do, hon?

03:45.057 --> 03:47.790
- No B's here.
- No B's here, all right.

03:47.792 --> 03:48.826
Good job.

03:50.028 --> 03:52.895
You know, Ben,
I'm proud of you.

03:52.897 --> 03:56.635
Okay? You did your best,
and that's all that matters.

03:57.603 --> 03:58.837
Dean's list.

04:00.705 --> 04:02.205
It's gonna be hard
when I leave.

04:02.207 --> 04:04.074
Can you survive without me?

04:04.076 --> 04:06.144
Where to?
A sumo wrestling camp, right?

04:06.146 --> 04:07.778
That's right.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.212
Don't I look good
in a ten-pound G-string?

04:09.214 --> 04:11.148
Oh, I don't wanna hear that.

04:11.150 --> 04:13.717
- You know you like that stuff.
- No, I know I hate that.

04:13.719 --> 04:16.086
- Especially you in a G-string.
- You know you like that stuff.

04:16.088 --> 04:18.022
Come on, man,
you're like a little lady.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.790
Let's go,
put some speed on it. Oh.

04:19.791 --> 04:20.994
Somebody fight me.

04:21.994 --> 04:23.227
What?

04:23.229 --> 04:24.830
I thought
this was a real gym.

04:26.932 --> 04:29.101
- Yeah, get him, Tank.
- Yeah, get him!

04:30.103 --> 04:32.070
Rip that ponytail off him.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.740
Pull his hair or somethin'.

04:35.975 --> 04:38.076
Oh!

04:38.078 --> 04:39.976
Tank just got knocked out.

04:39.978 --> 04:42.180
What was that, ten seconds?

04:42.182 --> 04:44.115
Fighting's tough,
right, Tank?

04:48.788 --> 04:50.687
Come on.

04:50.689 --> 04:53.024
I thought
this was a real gym.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.827
- I got a hundred bucks on it.
- A hundred bucks? What?

04:55.829 --> 04:57.662
- Oh, this is mine.
- Oh, oh...

04:57.664 --> 04:59.997
No, no, no,
too slow, second best.

04:59.999 --> 05:01.634
Don't get knocked out.

05:02.902 --> 05:04.135
Must be ladies' night
in the gym.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.942
Oh, look at this guy.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.938
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.142
Ladies first.

05:44.946 --> 05:46.981
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
the hundred dollars.

05:50.151 --> 05:50.985
Yeah.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.954
That's what I'm talkin' about.

05:54.956 --> 05:57.223
I got that hundred dollars
for that G-string.

05:57.225 --> 05:59.025
- Blood money.
- Yeah, half of that is mine.

05:59.027 --> 06:00.994
Oh, no, blood money
pays the bills.

06:00.996 --> 06:02.195
Yeah, you got
a lot of those.

06:02.197 --> 06:03.731
Aw.

06:05.967 --> 06:09.135
What you say we fight to see
who's second best, Miss Benjie?

06:10.972 --> 06:12.073
All right.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.075
Let's fight.

06:16.077 --> 06:18.847
Ben! Michael!

06:20.316 --> 06:22.218
You two in my office
right now.

06:24.186 --> 06:27.789
Fellas, it does nothing
to fight out there.

06:28.323 --> 06:30.693
All right, give us a fight.

06:31.527 --> 06:33.760
Michael,
I got a fight for you.

06:33.762 --> 06:37.764
What?
A fight for pretty boy?

06:37.766 --> 06:38.831
What about me?

06:38.833 --> 06:40.334
See, Nick is smart.

06:40.336 --> 06:42.937
He knows who the strong fighter
is, and who the weak one is.

06:42.939 --> 06:44.271
Simmer down.

06:46.242 --> 06:48.542
Come on, Nick.

06:48.544 --> 06:50.377
I'm better than him,
and you know it.

06:50.379 --> 06:52.982
I got a fight for you
in the works.

06:54.917 --> 06:57.252
All right.
Let's go, Luke!

06:57.254 --> 06:58.986
Way to go, Lukitus!

06:58.988 --> 07:00.256
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

07:01.991 --> 07:03.357
Goal!

07:07.831 --> 07:09.066
He's really good.

07:10.167 --> 07:11.399
- Okay?
- Sounds good.

07:11.401 --> 07:12.868
Yes, sir.

07:17.340 --> 07:20.976
Luke Bernard. Hey, I'm Phillip Moore.
Real Salt Lake, major league soccer.

07:20.978 --> 07:22.877
- How are ya?
- Wow.

07:22.879 --> 07:24.112
I watched you guys
win the Cup.

07:24.114 --> 07:25.280
Well, we've been
watching you too.

07:25.282 --> 07:27.148
Listen,
the coaches love you.

07:27.150 --> 07:29.284
The front office loves you.
And I'm a fan.

07:29.286 --> 07:32.153
So, they sent me out to see
if I could find a new striker

07:32.155 --> 07:34.289
that might be interested in playing
major league soccer in Utah.

07:34.291 --> 07:36.057
You know anybody?

07:36.059 --> 07:37.826
Absolutely.

07:37.828 --> 07:39.060
Here's my card.

07:39.062 --> 07:40.295
- Thank you, sir.
- You bet.

07:40.297 --> 07:42.265
- Let's stay in touch.
- Yeah.

07:42.267 --> 07:45.001
Maybe we can look at flying you
out to Salt Lake before the draft.

07:45.003 --> 07:46.269
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Does that sound good?

07:46.271 --> 07:48.036
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Hey, you like hats?

07:48.038 --> 07:49.904
- Yes, sir.
- That's for you.

07:49.906 --> 07:51.273
- Thank you.
- Yeah, very well done, man.

07:51.275 --> 07:52.874
- Thank you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

07:52.876 --> 07:54.012
- Thank you.
- We'll be in touch.

07:56.881 --> 07:58.047
Look at this!

07:58.049 --> 08:00.049
Whoa!
What was up with that?

08:00.051 --> 08:01.319
Real Salt Lake.

08:02.387 --> 08:03.952
- Put it on.
- Yeah, on you.

08:03.954 --> 08:05.187
- No, you gotta put it on!
- You deserve it.

08:05.189 --> 08:06.258
No, come on.

08:22.207 --> 08:24.206
What's up, man?

08:24.208 --> 08:28.946
Here is all of my clothes
that you were asking for.

08:30.282 --> 08:32.083
Can't take a joke?

08:37.121 --> 08:38.190
You weren't at my practice.

08:39.390 --> 08:40.825
I scored three goals.

08:41.460 --> 08:42.861
Dad was there.

08:44.096 --> 08:45.197
Of course.

08:46.365 --> 08:48.498
Never watches me fight.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.234
- Hey!
- What?

08:51.236 --> 08:53.270
You know that old Plymouth
Barracuda I wanted?

08:53.272 --> 08:54.938
What?

08:54.940 --> 08:57.107
- Sure, yeah.
- I found one.

08:57.109 --> 09:00.243
I mean, it needs some work,
but...

09:00.245 --> 09:02.348
figured maybe you and I
can fix it up together.

09:03.115 --> 09:06.353
Yeah, well... ask Dad.

09:07.954 --> 09:09.988
All right, Ben,
you have a nice day too, bud.

09:22.402 --> 09:24.168
That's pretty tight, huh?

09:24.170 --> 09:26.070
- Hey, Benjamin!
- Hey.

09:26.072 --> 09:28.072
You're just in time.
We're gonna swap out the alternator next,

09:28.074 --> 09:30.409
and the owner's manual says
it's a three-Bernard job.

09:30.411 --> 09:34.147
Yeah. Yeah, where's Mom?
I need to get my suit.

09:36.349 --> 09:38.416
Mom is likely inside.

09:38.418 --> 09:40.485
I tell you what,
why don't I go find your mom,

09:40.487 --> 09:43.290
and maybe you can help us
next week.

09:49.229 --> 09:52.330
You better get going.
Don't you need time to powder that face?

09:54.168 --> 09:55.936
I can go like this and still
look better than you, Ben.

09:56.437 --> 09:57.471
Uh-huh.

09:59.173 --> 10:02.039
Hey. You wanna take
this baby tonight?

10:02.041 --> 10:04.243
You got it working?

10:04.245 --> 10:07.279
Yeah, well, it would if you would
have helped me when I asked.

10:07.281 --> 10:09.047
You got your best bud.

10:09.049 --> 10:11.285
You told me to ask Dad.

10:12.754 --> 10:14.420
Who's behind you, Luke?
Who's behind you...

10:14.422 --> 10:18.024
Okay, that's not even
about me and Dad, stupid.

10:18.026 --> 10:19.127
God's behind me.

10:20.060 --> 10:22.397
Yeah, God's behind me too.

10:23.765 --> 10:25.132
Way behind me.

10:29.370 --> 10:31.106
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

10:32.174 --> 10:33.208
Ben!

10:35.343 --> 10:38.311
You look... beautiful.

10:38.313 --> 10:39.479
Thank you.

10:39.481 --> 10:41.346
Here.

10:41.348 --> 10:44.085
- Daisies!
- I know you love 'em.

10:46.555 --> 10:48.588
Did I screw up?

10:48.590 --> 10:51.291
Yeah, but... now you owe me.

10:51.293 --> 10:52.327
Name it.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.163
You can start with a kiss.

10:56.164 --> 10:57.332
Oh.

11:07.510 --> 11:10.511
Do I need to be worried about
that guy who just hugged you?

11:10.513 --> 11:12.111
- Stop it.
- What?

11:12.113 --> 11:13.380
We're all professionals.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.016
I'm sorry, I just...

11:16.184 --> 11:17.588
think about you
all the time.

11:18.387 --> 11:20.321
My solo's for you.

11:20.323 --> 11:22.056
Always.

11:22.058 --> 11:23.259
My Ben.

11:26.262 --> 11:27.530
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:57.623 --> 12:59.625
Whoo! Whoo!

13:00.626 --> 13:02.191
Go, Ashley!

13:14.640 --> 13:17.374
Nice outfit.

13:17.376 --> 13:19.643
You do
look better than me.

13:19.645 --> 13:21.478
I know.

13:21.480 --> 13:24.247
Thank you,
it was my idea.

13:24.249 --> 13:25.349
Oh.

13:25.351 --> 13:26.950
Hey, Ben. Take a look.

13:26.952 --> 13:28.752
Oh, nice!

13:28.754 --> 13:31.658
Now, that's ball and chain.

13:33.660 --> 13:36.526
- Congrats, Ashley!
- Thank you!

13:36.528 --> 13:37.694
Oh, thank you.

13:37.696 --> 13:39.398
I have something special
for you.

13:45.438 --> 13:48.405
Oh, I love it!
Thank you so much.

13:48.407 --> 13:50.642
You're so sweet, Rebecca.

13:50.644 --> 13:53.711
So, what did you all
think about my...

13:53.713 --> 13:55.981
- It was amazing.
- You were the best.

13:55.983 --> 13:57.217
Thank you.

13:58.284 --> 14:00.351
Stop!

14:00.353 --> 14:02.219
Congratulations!

14:02.221 --> 14:05.289
Oh, my gosh!
Okay, let's go celebrate.

14:05.291 --> 14:06.424
Like a double date.

14:06.426 --> 14:07.492
- Yes?
- Yes!

14:07.494 --> 14:08.794
Okay!

14:08.796 --> 14:10.595
Okay, I'm gonna go change.
I'll be right back.

14:10.597 --> 14:12.432
All right.

14:14.434 --> 14:15.568
Uh...

14:17.238 --> 14:18.604
Double date.

14:20.508 --> 14:22.175
- Yay.
- Yep.

14:23.711 --> 14:25.744
So have you set a date?

14:25.746 --> 14:27.846
No, it still
hasn't even hit me yet.

14:27.848 --> 14:29.648
- Right, that does happen.
- Stop.

14:29.650 --> 14:32.317
Luke, what made you want
to put a ring on her finger?

14:32.319 --> 14:33.585
A song told me to.

14:33.587 --> 14:36.255
Okay. So stupid!

14:36.257 --> 14:37.591
Tell them, my hubby-to-be.

14:38.726 --> 14:41.195
I wanted to get her a ring
before I go pro.

14:41.697 --> 14:43.763
- Pro?
- Yeah.

14:43.765 --> 14:45.199
Check it out.

14:47.668 --> 14:49.501
They say I'll go first round.

14:49.503 --> 14:51.670
Make bank.
Get Mom a new house.

14:51.672 --> 14:53.673
Get Dad a new set of wheels,
you know.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.475
First round?

14:55.477 --> 14:56.609
Yeah.

14:56.611 --> 14:58.277
Ben, how are you doing
in fighting?

14:58.279 --> 14:59.713
Uh...

14:59.715 --> 15:02.614
My trainer Nick, he is...

15:02.616 --> 15:05.353
working on getting me
a pro fight, so...

15:06.288 --> 15:07.454
It's good.

15:07.456 --> 15:08.523
Pro?

15:09.391 --> 15:10.890
Are you joking?

15:10.892 --> 15:12.459
Don't start with this.

15:12.461 --> 15:15.296
Hey, I'm legit, man.

15:16.064 --> 15:17.564
You always
have to be the star.

15:17.566 --> 15:20.368
Nah, some things
come naturally.

16:35.612 --> 16:36.747
Luke?

16:39.448 --> 16:40.449
Luke?

16:44.521 --> 16:45.589
Luke?

16:49.793 --> 16:50.828
Ash?

16:55.466 --> 16:56.833
Ashley?

17:10.481 --> 17:11.781
Dad.

17:11.782 --> 17:12.817
Uh...

17:15.519 --> 17:16.820
Something happened...

17:17.890 --> 17:19.622
to... Luke.

17:19.624 --> 17:20.692
He, uh...

17:23.528 --> 17:24.628
He's hurt.

17:42.514 --> 17:44.514
- Right, vitals?
- Can't get a BP.

17:44.516 --> 17:46.516
Weak pulse, GCS of 3.

17:46.518 --> 17:48.752
- Pupils?
- Dilated and fixed.

17:48.754 --> 17:50.787
Okay.
X-rays, head and chest.

17:50.789 --> 17:53.657
Prep for surgery. Tell them five minutes.
Most likely internal.

17:53.659 --> 17:54.693
Benjamin!

17:55.694 --> 17:57.628
Hey, Ben! Ben!

17:57.630 --> 17:59.730
- Ben? Ben?
- Son, no, stay down, stay down.

17:59.732 --> 18:01.465
- Oh, my God.
- Son, what in the world.

18:01.467 --> 18:02.833
Ben, oh, my God.

18:02.835 --> 18:04.601
Have you seen
the doctor?

18:04.603 --> 18:06.070
- Did the doctor take a look at you?
- Ben, look at me.

18:06.072 --> 18:07.939
- Are you the Bernards?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:07.941 --> 18:10.041
Your son suffered
severe brain injury.

18:10.043 --> 18:12.676
We're rushing him to surgery
to remove two blood clots.

18:12.678 --> 18:13.844
- What?
- But...

18:13.846 --> 18:15.846
But he'll be okay
after the surgery...

18:15.848 --> 18:18.750
We have to remove a portion of his
skull to allow his brain to swell.

18:18.752 --> 18:20.051
It's the only chance
to save him.

18:20.053 --> 18:21.953
But he will live, right?
I mean, he will live?

18:21.955 --> 18:24.521
I can't tell you what will happen.
We gotta get him to surgery.

18:24.523 --> 18:25.890
- No.
- Come here, sweetheart, come on.

18:25.892 --> 18:29.694
Doc? Ashley Walters, can I...

18:29.696 --> 18:30.929
May I see her?

18:30.931 --> 18:32.866
I'm sorry, you need
to consult her doctor.

18:36.002 --> 18:38.102
This is a great hospital.

18:38.104 --> 18:40.038
- I know.
- It's a great hospital, we know that.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.841
They're gonna do
everything that they can.

18:42.843 --> 18:44.809
- Daniel Bernard?
- Yeah. Yes.

18:44.811 --> 18:46.978
I'm the chaplain here
at the hospital.

18:46.980 --> 18:48.613
- Chaplain Norm.
- Oh, hi.

18:48.615 --> 18:50.081
I've been the chaplain here
for many years.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.050
I've seen God do miracles.

18:52.052 --> 18:54.687
Benjamin! Buddy, come on.

18:54.689 --> 18:55.955
We're gonna pray for your brother.

18:55.957 --> 18:58.692
Father in heaven,
we ask that you please...

18:59.726 --> 19:01.859
don't take Luke home...

19:01.861 --> 19:03.563
- Yes.
- ...now.

19:05.300 --> 19:08.636
We know that he's got a lot to do
here, and he's not nearly finished yet.

19:09.971 --> 19:11.572
He barely got started.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.942
And thank you so much...

19:15.977 --> 19:17.776
...for protecting
our son Benjamin...

19:17.778 --> 19:19.712
- Yes, God.
- ...through this.

19:24.618 --> 19:25.619
Craniotome.

19:35.763 --> 19:36.764
Forceps.

19:47.876 --> 19:49.510
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey.

19:54.616 --> 19:56.651
Why weren't you here
last night?

19:58.653 --> 20:00.522
Uh, I needed
to be alone.

20:02.190 --> 20:04.760
Well, the surgery
went very, very well.

20:10.099 --> 20:11.666
What are you
doing there?

20:12.701 --> 20:14.936
It's a blog.
I set this up for Luke.

20:17.640 --> 20:20.109
Look at this.
Look how many people are praying.

20:23.146 --> 20:24.713
Isn't that amazing?

20:29.685 --> 20:32.021
You really think that's
gonna make a difference?

20:33.089 --> 20:34.955
You know God answers prayers.

20:36.125 --> 20:38.161
Uh-huh. Right.

20:42.099 --> 20:43.167
Benjamin.

20:44.001 --> 20:45.733
Go see your brother.

20:45.735 --> 20:47.701
I'm not ready yet.

20:47.703 --> 20:49.203
Benjamin.

20:49.205 --> 20:50.773
He needs you.

20:52.041 --> 20:53.143
He needs you.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.115
Okay, Mom. Okay.

20:59.983 --> 21:00.984
I'll go.

21:34.018 --> 21:35.120
Come on, Luke.

21:54.473 --> 21:55.773
Hey.

21:58.042 --> 21:59.177
Hey.

22:00.178 --> 22:01.246
Hi.

22:02.914 --> 22:04.817
Oh, careful
with that.

22:08.220 --> 22:12.657
So, you act
like there's nothing wrong.

22:13.225 --> 22:16.795
Uh... Well,
I shattered my ankle.

22:17.730 --> 22:19.863
And I'm down a spleen.

22:19.865 --> 22:25.801
So... that's gonna negatively affect my
organ donation ratio for sure.

22:28.207 --> 22:30.073
Uh...

22:30.075 --> 22:35.913
I brought you these
so it can smell good in here.

22:39.285 --> 22:41.953
So, how is everyone else?

22:41.955 --> 22:43.256
Am I the only wimp?

22:45.158 --> 22:46.193
Uh...

22:47.360 --> 22:48.727
No.

22:50.930 --> 22:53.166
Luke's hurt real...

22:54.201 --> 22:55.833
really bad.

22:55.835 --> 22:57.170
How bad?

22:58.004 --> 22:59.172
Uh...

23:02.108 --> 23:03.840
It's bad.

23:03.842 --> 23:05.245
What about Rebecca?

23:09.282 --> 23:11.851
Uh, she... Rebecca's...

23:14.287 --> 23:15.987
No.

23:15.989 --> 23:17.158
No.

23:19.293 --> 23:20.328
No.

23:23.364 --> 23:25.732
Rebecca Seelos Reyes.

23:26.866 --> 23:28.901
To you,
she was your daughter.

23:28.903 --> 23:29.937
Some, a granddaughter.

23:30.338 --> 23:32.004
A sister.

23:32.006 --> 23:35.006
A friend to many of you.

23:35.008 --> 23:38.277
I had the honor of being able
to be her pastor,

23:38.279 --> 23:40.346
to love her and walk with her

23:40.348 --> 23:44.149
and see her develop and grow in her
faith and become a child of God.

23:44.151 --> 23:46.885
And while our pain
and our grief is real,

23:46.887 --> 23:49.888
something that's greater than
our pain is the promise of God.

23:49.890 --> 23:52.860
When we know this, we don't
grieve as others who have no hope.

23:53.295 --> 23:55.160
Today, we have hope.

23:55.162 --> 23:58.230
Our hope is the thing
that mitigates that pain

23:58.232 --> 24:00.001
and helps us get through.

24:01.202 --> 24:05.171
My prayer for you today is that
you'll feel the peace of God

24:05.173 --> 24:07.209
that passes all understanding,

24:08.210 --> 24:11.179
and that you'll know
that he loves you.

24:12.880 --> 24:16.384
And there's nothing that can
separate you from his love.

24:26.128 --> 24:27.928
Goin' for the record, huh?

24:29.365 --> 24:32.198
- How's your brother doin'?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.933
All right.

24:33.935 --> 24:36.069
Well, let's talk about
when you're gonna fight Mike.

24:36.071 --> 24:37.637
Hmm.

24:37.639 --> 24:40.641
All right, well,
that would be a short conversation.

24:40.643 --> 24:42.443
- Just like Mike.
- Just like Mike.

24:42.445 --> 24:44.111
You're a fighter, right?

24:44.113 --> 24:46.980
Uh... Um...

24:46.982 --> 24:49.115
His brother and him
got into a car accident.

24:49.117 --> 24:51.320
- His brother's girlfriend died.
- Shut up!

24:52.087 --> 24:53.487
All right.

24:53.489 --> 24:55.990
Wow, it sounds like
you're going through some stuff.

24:55.992 --> 24:59.026
Yeah, well, this is
how I'm dealin' right here.

24:59.028 --> 25:00.994
Mmm.

25:00.996 --> 25:03.096
His brother may not make it.
And his family's praying day and night.

25:03.098 --> 25:06.167
- Who wouldn't be?
- No, there's no reason to pray.

25:06.169 --> 25:08.369
Whoever's up there,
he's not doing a very good job.

25:08.371 --> 25:09.671
Let's find out.

25:09.673 --> 25:12.373
Okay, let's find out.
What? What?

25:12.375 --> 25:15.144
Do you guys
know what these are?

25:16.145 --> 25:18.180
Uh-oh, she got
Chuck E. Cheese tokens.

25:18.182 --> 25:23.317
No, they are sobriety chips
from AA people.

25:23.319 --> 25:26.921
When their best efforts fail
them, they come in here.

25:26.923 --> 25:29.991
So, these are
one-month chips.

25:29.993 --> 25:31.493
We get a lot of these.

25:31.495 --> 25:34.129
But you know
what we don't see a lot of?

25:34.131 --> 25:35.464
What?

25:35.466 --> 25:37.232
Six-month chips.

25:37.234 --> 25:40.969
'Cause after six months,
you form a habit.

25:40.971 --> 25:43.305
Then you don't have to
come in here.

25:43.307 --> 25:47.409
Girl, you trippin'.
You got all those chips from tonight.

25:47.411 --> 25:49.378
Proves that nobody
makes it that long.

25:49.380 --> 25:52.347
Yeah. Nobody.

25:52.349 --> 25:54.116
Okay, I'll tell you what.

25:54.118 --> 25:55.351
You take these,

25:55.353 --> 25:57.520
and if your brother recovers
in six months,

25:57.522 --> 26:00.090
you bring them back in,
and dinner's on the house.

26:04.461 --> 26:05.497
Fine.

26:06.998 --> 26:08.031
Fine.

26:09.300 --> 26:11.369
- Bet's on.
- All right.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.072
Hey.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.477
Are Luke's eyes...

26:56.549 --> 26:59.116
They're open.
His eyes are open!

26:59.118 --> 27:00.152
Luke?

27:01.587 --> 27:04.322
- Luke?
- I believe they are. Praise God.

27:05.425 --> 27:07.491
- Luke?
- Hey. Hey.

27:07.493 --> 27:10.260
- Hey, buddy.
- He's answering our prayers.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.129
He's answering
our prayers.

27:12.131 --> 27:15.199
Look, I think he's tracking
our conversation.

27:15.201 --> 27:18.068
He's tracking our conversation. Hey!

27:18.070 --> 27:19.504
Hey, honey.

27:19.506 --> 27:21.106
We're all here.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.043
Ben's here,
and Dad's here.

27:25.444 --> 27:26.545
We love you.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.249
Hey, Luke, it's Ben.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.487
We love you, son.

27:35.489 --> 27:37.322
- We love you so much.
- Hey, hey.

27:37.324 --> 27:40.190
- There he is.
- Hey. Look at those eyes, huh?

27:40.192 --> 27:41.526
Yeah.

27:41.528 --> 27:43.261
- Hi, Luke.
- Go on, get in there.

27:43.263 --> 27:44.830
- I know you wanna get in there. Go on.
- Let me see.

27:44.832 --> 27:47.432
- Go on, see your baby.
- Hey, honey.

27:47.434 --> 27:48.535
Hey, honey.

28:01.581 --> 28:03.114
Hey.

28:03.116 --> 28:04.182
Hey.

28:04.184 --> 28:06.218
Got a real diamond here,
huh?

28:06.220 --> 28:07.586
Diamond?

28:07.588 --> 28:10.121
Well, you know,
diamond in the rough.

28:10.123 --> 28:11.490
Yep.

28:11.492 --> 28:13.324
Yeah, let me show you
what we've done to her so far.

28:13.326 --> 28:15.093
Yeah.

28:15.095 --> 28:19.265
All the hoses were bad. Dry rot.
We replaced all those.

28:19.267 --> 28:21.700
This old baby still has drum
brakes, if you can believe that.

28:21.702 --> 28:23.569
So they had to go.

28:23.571 --> 28:26.272
About the only thing
that's any good is the motor.

28:26.274 --> 28:28.106
Yeah, that's what
surprised me.

28:28.108 --> 28:29.378
I...

28:30.311 --> 28:31.878
Tranny's bad,
gotta rebuild that.

28:31.880 --> 28:34.280
- Out, in, you know.
- Yeah.

28:34.282 --> 28:39.285
Well, I think two Bernards
can get her runnin'.

28:39.287 --> 28:41.123
What do you say, huh?

28:43.157 --> 28:44.293
I'm sorry, buddy, what?

28:45.561 --> 28:47.494
Two Bernards
can get her runnin'.

28:47.496 --> 28:50.464
Well, look, Benjamin, I'm...

28:53.602 --> 28:56.271
My heart's not in this.
We need to get Luke fixed first.

29:02.511 --> 29:04.645
Hey, you wanna come
see me fight tonight?

29:04.647 --> 29:06.681
It will get your mind
off things.

29:06.683 --> 29:08.183
We'll see, pal.

29:46.456 --> 29:48.157
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

29:51.794 --> 29:55.264
Well, well, well,
look who's ready for the big time.

29:55.699 --> 29:57.635
Yeah. Uh-huh.

29:58.501 --> 29:59.535
You okay?

30:00.603 --> 30:01.704
I'm fine.

30:02.605 --> 30:03.640
I'm fine.

30:06.677 --> 30:08.144
Hmm.

30:12.415 --> 30:14.716
Why doesn't he
stay awake?

30:14.718 --> 30:17.719
He's been staying awake
a little bit longer every day.

30:17.721 --> 30:19.488
- Yes.
- That's right.

30:19.490 --> 30:22.991
- Okay, I mean...
- He's doing good, Benjamin.

30:22.993 --> 30:25.427
All right, a little
longer's, yeah, that's...

30:25.429 --> 30:27.296
- It's good.
- That's good.

30:29.701 --> 30:31.366
- Hi, Doctor.
- Hey, Doc.

30:31.368 --> 30:32.536
Excuse me.

30:36.674 --> 30:39.841
All right, these extended awake
periods, very good sign.

30:39.843 --> 30:41.644
Let's schedule his
tracheotomy for tomorrow.

30:41.646 --> 30:43.613
What? Tracheotomy, why?

30:43.615 --> 30:46.381
- It's a very standard procedure.
- I don't know.

30:46.383 --> 30:48.316
- It'll help him recover faster.
- No, we said no.

30:48.318 --> 30:50.686
He'll regain consciousness
in 24 hours after surgery.

30:50.688 --> 30:53.258
- He'll be fine. He'll be fine.
- We said no.

30:55.393 --> 30:57.827
No. No.

30:57.829 --> 31:01.631
- No.
- We have to do whatever we have to do.

31:01.633 --> 31:03.333
It'll help him, Mom.

31:04.603 --> 31:07.805
Look, his eyes are open.
He's awake.

31:07.807 --> 31:10.339
- Look at your son, baby. Look at your son.
- Luke?

31:10.341 --> 31:11.607
It's okay, Mom.

31:11.609 --> 31:13.509
Look, he's awake.
He's awake again.

31:13.511 --> 31:15.478
Luke.

31:15.480 --> 31:16.782
Hey, buddy.

31:32.364 --> 31:34.232
Hey, sweetie.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.834
Welcome home, Ash.

31:36.836 --> 31:38.403
Thank you.

31:39.471 --> 31:42.639
I got you some roses
and daisies.

31:42.641 --> 31:44.310
Oh, my God.

31:45.444 --> 31:48.312
A sign.
Can you tell I drew it?

31:48.314 --> 31:49.780
- No, you didn't.
- You're right, I didn't.

31:51.450 --> 31:52.652
But it's the thought
that counts, right?

31:53.520 --> 31:54.552
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:55.789 --> 31:57.321
Look at this little guy.

31:57.323 --> 31:58.792
- Just like you.
- Oh, it's so cute.

31:59.793 --> 32:01.658
Oh, it's so good
to be home.

32:01.660 --> 32:03.761
- Yeah, I bet.
- I'm really tired, though.

32:03.763 --> 32:04.798
- I bet.
- Yeah.

32:05.799 --> 32:08.500
- Relax.
- Yeah.

32:08.502 --> 32:09.901
Speaking of relax,
take you to your room?

32:09.903 --> 32:12.436
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:12.438 --> 32:14.841
- Got the bear?
- Yep.

32:18.812 --> 32:20.647
- You good?
- Yeah.

32:21.515 --> 32:22.682
All right.

32:24.885 --> 32:26.520
All right.

32:37.430 --> 32:40.802
I'm super... glad
with how Luke's doing.

32:42.436 --> 32:43.702
Yeah.

32:43.704 --> 32:45.704
I mean, look at me.

32:45.706 --> 32:47.541
Can you believe
I'm home already?

32:47.975 --> 32:49.576
I'm looking.

32:50.978 --> 32:53.447
And I'm liking.

32:54.448 --> 32:57.449
Even with
this beat-up body?

32:57.451 --> 32:59.320
Oh, come on.

33:00.721 --> 33:04.492
- Your body is awesome.
- Ben.

33:06.995 --> 33:08.596
You gotta take me out.

33:10.464 --> 33:12.965
All right. Where to?

33:12.967 --> 33:14.802
Let's go to church
on Sunday.

33:18.406 --> 33:19.440
Church?

33:20.441 --> 33:22.678
Yeah. Church.

33:24.612 --> 33:25.780
All right.

33:31.854 --> 33:33.486
Church.

33:33.488 --> 33:35.555
So, I'd like you to join me
in prayer today.

33:35.557 --> 33:36.792
If you would, bow your heads.

33:38.961 --> 33:42.631
Because we're your children,
God, we come to you boldly.

33:43.599 --> 33:45.032
And, Lord,
as we come to you boldly,

33:45.034 --> 33:47.901
we pray for those who need
your comforting presence

33:47.903 --> 33:49.769
and healing power.

33:49.771 --> 33:53.475
And, Father, we agree
with the Bernard family.

33:54.509 --> 33:57.812
We agree with Daniel
and Kathy and Benjamin,

33:57.814 --> 34:02.918
and we believe you and we pray
for a complete recovery of Luke.

34:04.019 --> 34:08.458
Lord, we ask today,
open his eyes.

34:09.458 --> 34:11.626
- Restore him completely.
- Ben.

34:11.628 --> 34:13.027
It's about my fight.

34:13.029 --> 34:16.731
Heal his body,
we pray in Jesus' name.

34:16.733 --> 34:18.733
Amen.

34:18.735 --> 34:20.603
Okay, buddy,
it's time to get up.

34:22.804 --> 34:24.540
It's time to wake up.

34:25.942 --> 34:26.976
Son.

34:30.246 --> 34:35.551
- Luke.
- Luke, it's time to wake up.

34:38.922 --> 34:40.791
Luke, honey,
can you hear us?

34:41.692 --> 34:43.627
- Wake up, son.
- Daniel.

34:44.261 --> 34:46.261
- No! Wake up!
- Daniel.

34:46.263 --> 34:47.898
Luke, now!

34:57.275 --> 34:59.074
All right,
you know the deal.

34:59.076 --> 35:01.979
Protect yourselves
and obey my commands.

35:03.080 --> 35:05.614
Let's go! Fight!

35:38.883 --> 35:42.554
The winner,
Benjamin "The Favorite" Bernard!

35:47.025 --> 35:48.992
Are you giving him more drugs?

35:48.994 --> 35:50.927
Luke doesn't even drink.

35:50.929 --> 35:52.531
Nurse...

35:53.632 --> 35:55.899
no more. We don't want you
to sedate him anymore.

35:55.901 --> 35:58.102
- Stop.
- I'll talk to his doctor.

35:58.104 --> 36:00.703
You can talk to his doctor
all you want,

36:00.705 --> 36:02.072
but we would like you
to ask him

36:02.074 --> 36:04.643
not to sedate our son anymore,
please!

36:07.747 --> 36:08.879
I don't get it.

36:08.881 --> 36:12.615
How long is he
gonna be like this?

36:12.617 --> 36:14.918
Benjamin, we have thousands
of people praying.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.654
We're not gonna give up hope.
We're not.

36:17.656 --> 36:19.857
God can heal him.
I believe that.

36:19.859 --> 36:23.127
What? What God?
He hasn't done anything.

36:23.129 --> 36:25.729
Don't be ridiculous,
okay, Benjamin?

36:25.731 --> 36:27.197
Of course, he has.

36:27.199 --> 36:30.734
You're afraid you're gonna
lose your precious Lukitus.

36:30.736 --> 36:32.705
- Ben, stop it! Stop it!
- Oh, Benjamin.

36:33.672 --> 36:35.806
We love you.
We love you very much.

36:35.808 --> 36:38.711
We just want him better.
We want him to recover.

36:39.812 --> 36:42.949
What if he doesn't recover?
Huh?

36:43.683 --> 36:45.683
What then?

36:45.685 --> 36:47.852
Is God still good?

36:47.854 --> 36:49.820
Huh? Tell me that.

36:49.822 --> 36:51.724
Tell me that.

36:58.399 --> 37:00.600
It's me. It's me.

37:05.973 --> 37:07.705
Hi, Nikki.

37:07.707 --> 37:09.841
<i>Hey, Kathy.
How are you holding up?</i>

37:09.843 --> 37:11.776
As well as can be expected,
I suppose.

37:11.778 --> 37:14.212
We have thousands of people
praying for you.

37:14.214 --> 37:15.847
<i>Just focus on Luke,</i>

37:15.849 --> 37:18.717
<i>and let us know
if you need anything.</i>

37:18.719 --> 37:20.119
Nikki...

37:20.121 --> 37:21.887
can I ask you to pray
for something

37:21.889 --> 37:23.422
that I can't include
in the blog?

37:23.424 --> 37:25.723
What's that?

37:25.725 --> 37:26.793
Ben.

37:29.697 --> 37:31.831
<i>Dear God,
I lift up Luke right now,</i>

37:31.833 --> 37:34.602
<i>and I pray for complete
healing over his body.</i>

37:36.437 --> 37:37.937
<i>I pray for Dan and Kathy</i>

37:37.939 --> 37:40.175
<i>that you would encourage them
in this time.</i>

37:43.010 --> 37:46.712
<i>And I lift up Ben.
Please help Ben.</i>

37:46.714 --> 37:48.013
<i>Heal him, Lord,
spiritually,</i>

37:48.015 --> 37:50.017
<i>that he would come
to know your love.</i>

38:40.270 --> 38:43.204
All right.
I'm cutting you off.

38:43.206 --> 38:45.206
No.

38:45.208 --> 38:48.976
No, no, no, no.
No, I'm tapping you out.

38:48.978 --> 38:50.846
- Calling you a cab.
- No.

38:51.813 --> 38:54.817
My... My... My brother...

38:56.786 --> 38:59.822
he survives, first round.

39:00.356 --> 39:01.724
But now...

39:03.759 --> 39:06.028
he won't wake up.

39:06.030 --> 39:07.131
Wake up!

39:08.898 --> 39:10.700
It's been what? Two weeks?

39:11.335 --> 39:15.770
Everything's stupid.

39:15.772 --> 39:16.972
It's just so stupid...

39:16.974 --> 39:19.709
No, it's stupid
to give up this early.

39:23.981 --> 39:25.249
A rare chip
came in this week.

39:29.787 --> 39:32.955
Six-month blue chip.

39:32.957 --> 39:35.159
The guy said
he wouldn't be seeing me again.

39:38.329 --> 39:40.731
You are giving up too soon.

40:02.086 --> 40:04.388
Ladies and gentlemen!

40:04.390 --> 40:08.026
Clear the way
for Benjamin...

40:08.593 --> 40:11.196
"The Favorite" Bernard!

40:19.938 --> 40:21.904
Rare chip. Rare chip.

40:23.942 --> 40:26.011
Cab's on its way.

40:30.983 --> 40:33.252
- Yeah, I'll get it.
- You sure?

40:34.353 --> 40:36.187
- Is that Ben?
- Ben?

40:37.222 --> 40:39.055
Hey, I'll see you
in a little bit.

40:39.057 --> 40:40.124
- Yeah.
- Okay.

40:40.126 --> 40:41.925
Ben? Hon?

40:41.927 --> 40:43.427
Wake up.

40:43.429 --> 40:45.162
- Hey. Hey.
- Oh, Mom.

40:45.164 --> 40:47.231
- Have you been here all night?
- Okay, Mom, I'm okay.

40:47.233 --> 40:49.201
Oh, Ben, you reek.

40:51.337 --> 40:52.838
You need a shower.

40:53.373 --> 40:55.072
Okay.

40:55.074 --> 40:56.340
Okay.

40:56.342 --> 40:59.343
Just give me,
give me a minute.

40:59.345 --> 41:01.947
Benjamin,
go get some coffee, hon.

41:04.451 --> 41:05.818
Okay.

41:09.323 --> 41:10.390
How's Ben?

41:13.225 --> 41:14.827
He's hungover.

41:15.996 --> 41:17.064
Hungover.

41:17.664 --> 41:18.997
What's this?

41:18.999 --> 41:21.968
No, no,
I don't want to see that.

41:28.041 --> 41:29.242
Son.

41:31.912 --> 41:32.946
What is that?

41:33.880 --> 41:36.047
The hospital bill.
We're not covered for it.

41:36.049 --> 41:38.149
What? We're not covered?

41:38.151 --> 41:39.284
Well, no, we're covered,

41:39.286 --> 41:40.887
we're just not,
we're not that...

41:41.356 --> 41:42.390
that covered.

41:43.990 --> 41:45.123
Can I see it?

41:45.125 --> 41:46.324
- No.
- Hey, Ben.

41:46.326 --> 41:48.426
Hon, don't worry
about that, okay?

41:48.428 --> 41:50.428
Don't worry about that.
God's gonna provide for us.

41:50.430 --> 41:52.431
He will. He will.

41:52.433 --> 41:54.001
He will.

41:58.473 --> 41:59.873
Daniel?

42:00.508 --> 42:03.409
Luke? Luke, hon?

42:03.411 --> 42:05.411
- He's awake?
- Luke?

42:05.413 --> 42:08.013
- Daniel!
- He's awake! Hey!

42:08.015 --> 42:09.215
Hi, honey.

42:09.217 --> 42:10.316
Hey, buddy.

42:10.318 --> 42:12.053
- Hey.
- I can't believe it.

42:13.221 --> 42:15.019
Where have you been?

42:15.021 --> 42:17.190
It's Mom and Dad
and Ben!

42:17.192 --> 42:18.425
Hey, hey, Luke.

42:18.427 --> 42:20.159
- Hey, pal.
- Hi, honey.

42:20.161 --> 42:23.331
- We're here, we're all here.
- Where you been?

42:24.165 --> 42:25.331
Luke?

42:27.168 --> 42:28.904
Hey.

42:34.209 --> 42:38.177
All right. So up.

42:38.179 --> 42:42.418
And down. Just like that.
Go ahead.

42:44.153 --> 42:45.452
How about the leg?

42:45.454 --> 42:50.323
- Go up. And down.
- Ben.

42:50.325 --> 42:51.927
What are you doing?

42:53.162 --> 42:56.432
I'm moving his arms
and legs around to...

42:57.533 --> 43:00.333
The doc says that
they need to see him have

43:00.335 --> 43:01.535
intentional movement,

43:01.537 --> 43:04.138
- and not just twitches, and...
- Right.

43:04.140 --> 43:08.074
So I'm moving him,
trying to get him to move on his own,

43:08.076 --> 43:10.378
but... but he's not.

43:10.380 --> 43:13.348
It just...
I don't know what to...

43:14.149 --> 43:15.384
What...

43:16.586 --> 43:18.152
He did it.

43:18.154 --> 43:19.454
That was awesome!

43:19.456 --> 43:22.356
Ash, go get
a doctor or nurse.

43:22.358 --> 43:24.459
- Right.
- Go!

43:24.461 --> 43:28.430
Yes! Yes!
Luke, move your leg again.

43:28.432 --> 43:29.598
Come on.

43:29.600 --> 43:32.099
Come on, Luke,
cross your leg again.

43:32.101 --> 43:33.436
Do this one, go, just...

43:35.104 --> 43:37.238
up and back.

43:37.240 --> 43:40.009
Do it just like that.
Come on, you can do it.

43:41.278 --> 43:44.247
Come on, Luke.
Come on. You can do this.

43:46.249 --> 43:47.616
Cross your legs.

43:47.618 --> 43:50.117
Hey, guys.
Intentional movement?

43:50.119 --> 43:55.192
Yeah, he brought his legs up
and he crossed it.

43:56.393 --> 43:58.995
Now he's not moving anymore.

44:00.196 --> 44:01.530
Just like that.

44:09.240 --> 44:11.373
Yeah, that looks
intentional to me.

44:11.375 --> 44:12.610
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

44:14.512 --> 44:18.247
Whoa. Whoa.

44:18.249 --> 44:21.318
That is over-the-top
intentional movement.

44:22.119 --> 44:23.153
So, Luke.

44:24.154 --> 44:25.256
Doc?

44:26.190 --> 44:27.358
How?

44:28.693 --> 44:35.032
How can he move up like that
with a broken back?

44:37.167 --> 44:39.401
Maybe you need to do
more X-rays.

44:39.403 --> 44:40.605
Yeah.

44:42.173 --> 44:43.441
We'll look into that.

44:55.120 --> 44:57.587
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, kiddo, hi!

44:57.589 --> 44:59.656
Hey, I brought you
some lunch.

44:59.658 --> 45:02.525
Thank you, thank you.
Just put it right there for me.

45:02.527 --> 45:04.597
- It's lunchtime.
- I know, I appreciate it.

45:06.131 --> 45:09.402
I brought something for you.

45:11.169 --> 45:13.303
Recognize this?

45:13.305 --> 45:16.208
- Huh? Look at this guy.
- Yeah?

45:17.610 --> 45:19.078
No.

45:20.279 --> 45:22.212
It's okay.
Hey, it's okay.

45:22.214 --> 45:24.147
The doctors say
he's making progress.

45:24.149 --> 45:25.683
He is. He is.

45:25.685 --> 45:27.418
- Good.
- Just give it time.

45:27.420 --> 45:30.722
- Let's get him fixed.
- Give it time.

45:30.724 --> 45:32.556
What else do you have?

45:32.558 --> 45:34.627
Oh, my goodness,
look at this.

45:36.429 --> 45:38.596
Oh, my goodness,
look at this.

45:38.598 --> 45:40.167
What about that?

45:41.335 --> 45:43.401
Do you recognize that?

45:43.403 --> 45:44.504
Huh?

45:45.639 --> 45:47.373
Do you remember
that day?

45:53.447 --> 45:55.413
You recognize me.

45:55.415 --> 45:57.149
You recognize me.

45:57.684 --> 45:59.284
You recognize me.

45:59.286 --> 46:02.487
He's coming back.
He is coming back, Mom.

46:02.489 --> 46:03.756
- He's coming back.
- Thank the Lord.

46:03.758 --> 46:05.592
- Yeah.
- Complete recovery.

46:07.227 --> 46:08.295
Yeah.

46:09.730 --> 46:10.795
Complete.

46:10.797 --> 46:12.399
Who's it...

46:14.234 --> 46:15.570
I think
he's trying to talk.

46:16.437 --> 46:17.639
- What'd you say?
- What?

46:19.974 --> 46:21.339
Who is that?

46:21.341 --> 46:23.675
- I think it's the...
- The trach, yeah.

46:23.677 --> 46:24.711
Cover it up.

46:26.413 --> 46:27.649
Who is that?

46:29.350 --> 46:30.418
- Me?
- Her?

46:32.286 --> 46:34.287
Ashley.
I'm Ashley, Luke.

46:34.989 --> 46:36.223
What...

46:37.424 --> 46:39.427
- Ashley.
- Ashley.

46:44.699 --> 46:46.298
- It's okay.
- He doesn't remember.

46:46.300 --> 46:47.368
It's okay.

46:48.002 --> 46:49.237
It's okay.

46:54.843 --> 46:56.210
Ooh.

46:57.612 --> 46:59.414
That's gonna cost you, champ.

47:01.582 --> 47:03.452
Ben, you need to work
on your submissions.

47:04.553 --> 47:06.586
Why submit when you can
just knock someone out?

47:06.588 --> 47:08.388
You wish.

47:08.390 --> 47:10.524
You gotta be a
well-rounded fighter to go pro.

47:10.526 --> 47:12.560
Come over, let me show you
this move real quick.

47:13.461 --> 47:14.728
Down there right quick.

47:14.730 --> 47:16.463
Man, aren't you
too old for this?

47:16.465 --> 47:17.864
Was I too old
when I sat you down

47:17.866 --> 47:19.733
with that body slam
last week?

47:19.735 --> 47:22.769
- You got lucky.
- Then get your butt on down here then.

47:22.771 --> 47:25.304
All right, first,
grab the hands of the person

47:25.306 --> 47:26.405
when you pull them up, right?

47:26.407 --> 47:27.675
Pull the hands up, see?

47:27.677 --> 47:29.443
Knock 'em off balance.

47:29.445 --> 47:33.413
Next step, you bring your arm
till you get the tricep.

47:33.415 --> 47:36.383
Take this hand
and push his head over.

47:36.385 --> 47:37.617
I'm old.

47:37.619 --> 47:40.321
I can't be spinnin'
like a turtle shell.

47:40.323 --> 47:42.623
So now I pull my legs
over the top.

47:42.625 --> 47:44.759
Now I'm in this position
right here.

47:44.761 --> 47:47.527
You're tryin' to pull the arm
out of the socket.

47:47.529 --> 47:50.430
Arch your back
and apply pressure!

47:53.336 --> 47:55.839
This is a good one for you.
You pull real hard.

47:58.374 --> 47:59.709
Ain't that old, am I?

48:08.585 --> 48:11.352
Honey, it's the scout
from Real Salt Lake.

48:11.354 --> 48:12.553
I need to take it.

48:12.555 --> 48:14.457
I'll meet you in there
in a few minutes.

48:17.728 --> 48:20.328
Hi. Hello?

48:20.330 --> 48:23.331
<i>Mr. Bernard.
Phillip Moore, Real Salt Lake.</i>

48:23.333 --> 48:25.100
I just got the news about Luke.
How's he doing?

48:25.102 --> 48:26.569
Um...

48:28.739 --> 48:30.339
to be honest with you,

48:30.341 --> 48:32.309
it's a miracle
that he's made it this far.

48:33.944 --> 48:35.744
And...

48:35.746 --> 48:39.348
I don't know what I can tell you
about his soccer career.

48:39.350 --> 48:43.687
I am so,
so sorry to hear that.

48:45.923 --> 48:48.557
Listen,
for what it's worth...

48:48.559 --> 48:50.659
Luke was going to be
our number one draft pick.

48:50.661 --> 48:52.831
First round draft pick,
that's...

48:54.398 --> 48:55.599
that's fantastic.

48:57.568 --> 48:58.702
Very proud of him.

48:59.603 --> 49:00.805
Look, it's been tough...

49:56.996 --> 49:58.896
- Now, let's get you out of the chair.
- Hey!

49:58.898 --> 50:00.664
- All right. Be careful.
- On the bed.

50:00.666 --> 50:02.700
They said to move slowly.
They said to move really slow.

50:02.702 --> 50:04.202
Take it easy, not fast.

50:04.204 --> 50:06.905
- Luke, Luke, Luke!
- I just wanna get out of here!

50:06.907 --> 50:08.806
- No, no, no. Daniel! Daniel!
- Luke!

50:08.808 --> 50:10.741
- Why...
- Luke, you can't do this!

50:10.743 --> 50:11.942
Over here, come on.

50:11.944 --> 50:14.678
Hey! Son! You've got
to go through rehab!

50:14.680 --> 50:15.914
I don't know
why he's doing this.

50:15.916 --> 50:17.582
- You're gonna...
- Let me out!

50:17.584 --> 50:20.517
- Let me out!
- Son. Son! Listen to me.

50:20.519 --> 50:22.519
It's all part of the process.

50:22.521 --> 50:24.922
They said that a brain injury is
like knocking over a filing cabinet.

50:24.924 --> 50:26.957
You have to put the files
back in the right folders.

50:26.959 --> 50:29.561
I hate you! I hate you!

50:29.563 --> 50:30.862
Daniel, I can't stand this.

50:30.864 --> 50:32.764
The nurses said
that he would likely be angry.

50:32.766 --> 50:35.033
It's all right. I understand
you don't mean that, son.

50:35.035 --> 50:39.704
I understand. Just right here.
It's all right. It's okay.

50:39.706 --> 50:41.907
I think I'd like a little bit
of brain trauma.

50:41.909 --> 50:43.808
You know, Benjamin,
if you're not gonna help,

50:43.810 --> 50:46.878
then don't be here, all right?
If you're gonna be here, be here!

50:46.880 --> 50:49.614
- All right, I'm gone.
- Benjamin!

50:52.687 --> 50:53.886
Hey. Hey.

50:53.888 --> 50:56.923
- It's okay.
- Look at me. Look at me.

50:56.925 --> 50:58.991
Think of all the stress
your dad is going through.

50:58.993 --> 51:01.962
- I keep messing up!
- Yeah, you messed up.

51:02.829 --> 51:04.497
Now you need to work it out.

51:04.499 --> 51:06.265
You don't know everything
that's happened, okay?

51:06.267 --> 51:08.736
I do know that you need
to figure it out with your dad.

51:10.638 --> 51:13.707
Yeah, well,
it's figured out.

51:14.508 --> 51:16.742
I know what I need to do.

51:16.744 --> 51:17.979
What is this?

51:18.980 --> 51:22.114
It's just a reminder...

51:22.116 --> 51:23.985
of something else
I need to do.

51:24.919 --> 51:27.455
- That's it.
- Okay.

51:28.589 --> 51:30.290
After several X-rays,

51:30.292 --> 51:32.625
we find his vertebrae
to be stable.

51:32.627 --> 51:36.696
Stable. You say that.
What does that mean?

51:36.698 --> 51:39.868
Stable means we can no longer
find breaks in his vertebrae.

51:40.869 --> 51:42.669
So he's healed.

51:42.671 --> 51:44.671
Well, all I can say is that
we can no longer find breaks.

51:44.673 --> 51:45.906
He's healed.

51:45.908 --> 51:48.010
Which means we can now
take the braces off.

51:49.111 --> 51:52.012
Luke, you're healed.

51:52.014 --> 51:55.015
- You're healed.
- Hug your son. God.

51:55.017 --> 51:57.753
But not too hard.

51:58.887 --> 52:00.622
Do you hear that? Yeah.

52:03.592 --> 52:05.026
What's going on
over there?

52:05.028 --> 52:06.760
Oh, that guy?

52:06.762 --> 52:08.630
He's just some promoter
from one of the title fights.

52:18.341 --> 52:20.141
You scheduling
a title fight?

52:20.143 --> 52:22.043
- He already has.
- Who are you?

52:22.045 --> 52:23.710
Benjamin
"The Favorite" Bernard.

52:23.712 --> 52:25.645
You want the best to fight
for the title, right?

52:25.647 --> 52:28.883
Of course, but Michael's won his
last four fights in the region.

52:28.885 --> 52:30.184
But I'm better.

52:30.186 --> 52:33.054
There's no way
Miss Benjie Bernard

52:33.056 --> 52:34.355
is better than me.

52:34.357 --> 52:36.758
I'll fight. Let's prove it.

52:36.760 --> 52:39.861
Yeah, us too. Let's fight!

52:39.863 --> 52:42.064
Won't prove who's the best
unless we have other fighters.

52:42.066 --> 52:43.965
All right. Get...

52:43.967 --> 52:45.969
get other fighters
for a tournament fight.

52:47.037 --> 52:49.170
This is gonna make
the title fight even bigger.

52:49.172 --> 52:51.106
- Yeah.
- The two of you.

52:51.108 --> 52:53.674
I'll find
two other fighters.

52:53.676 --> 52:55.377
$2,500 to fight,

52:55.379 --> 52:58.782
$10,000 in a grand prize
for the winner.

53:01.951 --> 53:03.685
All right.

53:03.687 --> 53:05.087
Here's
the starting line.

53:05.089 --> 53:08.791
We'll get you out, one second.
Just hold on a second.

53:08.793 --> 53:09.925
- Dad, get...
- I got it, I got it.

53:09.927 --> 53:10.959
- Can you get it?
- Yep.

53:10.961 --> 53:12.961
I'll help him up,
all right.

53:12.963 --> 53:14.662
- And up.
- Easy.

53:14.664 --> 53:15.697
All right.

53:15.699 --> 53:18.667
You ready? And go!

53:18.669 --> 53:21.170
Oh, yeah, you're doing...
Oh, look at this.

53:21.172 --> 53:23.972
You're gonna play
soccer again real soon.

53:23.974 --> 53:25.176
Oh, yeah.

53:31.715 --> 53:34.417
All right. All right.
You got it.

53:34.419 --> 53:36.085
Right behind you,
buddy, if you need me.

53:36.087 --> 53:38.589
Just stay in your breath.

53:40.125 --> 53:41.126
You doin' all right?

53:42.260 --> 53:44.094
Yeah,
I'm just worried for you.

53:44.096 --> 53:46.196
Why?

53:46.198 --> 53:48.131
Hey, let's stop, okay?

53:48.133 --> 53:49.998
- No, I'm not...
- Come on, you did great.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.002
- Take the chair the rest of the way. Luke!
- Hey, Luke!

53:53.004 --> 53:54.804
Get him.

53:54.806 --> 53:57.207
Hey, hey, buddy, you okay?

53:57.209 --> 53:58.775
- Here, help me.
- Let's get him up.

53:58.777 --> 54:00.276
Come on, come on, come on.

54:00.278 --> 54:02.112
Get him,
I'll get the chair.

54:02.114 --> 54:04.081
Look, there's no...

54:04.083 --> 54:06.852
shame in finishing
in the chair, son, come on.

54:12.090 --> 54:13.758
I can't do anything.

54:15.161 --> 54:16.894
I can't even run.

54:16.896 --> 54:18.831
You will run.

54:19.899 --> 54:21.666
You will play soccer.

54:23.302 --> 54:24.803
You really think that?

54:25.238 --> 54:26.771
We're Bernards.

54:27.241 --> 54:29.008
Bernards never quit.

54:29.842 --> 54:31.742
We can get through this.

54:31.744 --> 54:33.744
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

54:33.746 --> 54:35.012
- All right.
- Lift your feet up, buddy.

54:35.014 --> 54:37.047
- Let's go. You got it?
- There we go.

54:37.049 --> 54:38.748
All right.

54:38.750 --> 54:40.118
No shame in doing it this way.
You did great.

54:40.120 --> 54:42.320
Before the accident I
could run laps around you.

54:42.322 --> 54:44.121
Yeah.

54:44.123 --> 54:45.923
Now we're about
neck and neck.

54:45.925 --> 54:50.060
Oh! Looks like you still
got your sense of humor.

54:50.062 --> 54:52.797
Humor, you either have it
or you don't.

54:52.799 --> 54:53.965
I'm sorry you don't,
Ben.

54:53.967 --> 54:55.833
Oh, my God.

54:55.835 --> 54:58.503
Here we go, look,
everyone's cheering you on, man.

54:58.505 --> 55:00.274
Finish right there.

55:01.508 --> 55:02.974
You did good, Luke.

55:02.976 --> 55:04.142
You did great.

55:04.144 --> 55:05.744
- Stop.
- What?

55:05.746 --> 55:06.914
- What?
- Stop.

55:08.215 --> 55:10.081
- The finish line is right there, son.
- Yeah.

55:10.083 --> 55:11.684
I don't want to finish in this.

55:12.319 --> 55:14.052
You need the chair
to finish, Luke.

55:14.054 --> 55:15.921
You can't finish
without the chair.

55:15.923 --> 55:17.523
No, you don't.
You don't need it.

55:17.525 --> 55:19.891
- Benjamin.
- You can do this.

55:19.893 --> 55:21.326
Come on,
let me get you up.

55:21.328 --> 55:24.229
All right, all right,
all right.

55:24.231 --> 55:26.898
All right, take your time,
take your time.

55:26.900 --> 55:29.868
Finish line is right over
here, all right?

55:29.870 --> 55:31.103
It's right over here.

55:31.105 --> 55:32.971
- All right.
- You got this, come on.

55:32.973 --> 55:34.973
Come on.
You can do it, Luke.

55:34.975 --> 55:36.975
Come on! Come on, man!

55:36.977 --> 55:38.810
You got this, Luke.

55:38.812 --> 55:41.214
You got it! Keep on coming.
Don't get in that wheelchair!

55:41.216 --> 55:42.815
Come on,
it's right there!

55:42.817 --> 55:44.317
We believe in you!
Come on! Come on!

55:44.319 --> 55:46.118
- Come on! Come on!
- You got this, Luke!

55:46.120 --> 55:48.954
Come on! Oh, yeah!

55:48.956 --> 55:51.258
Yeah!

55:51.260 --> 55:52.328
Yeah!

55:55.830 --> 55:58.564
Oh, look
who finally shows up!

55:58.566 --> 56:00.166
- Hurry up!
- All right, all right.

56:00.168 --> 56:02.301
You take longer than Ashley
to get ready.

56:02.303 --> 56:04.204
What? Look who's talking,
slow motion.

56:04.206 --> 56:06.872
- I'm faster than you!
- Oh, you're faster than me, huh?

56:06.874 --> 56:08.275
- Yeah, they call me Flash.
- Oh, okay.

56:08.277 --> 56:09.942
What do they call you
again?

56:09.944 --> 56:11.310
- We're about to see what they call me.
- Turtle.

56:11.312 --> 56:12.780
Turtle power.

56:14.082 --> 56:16.085
Very soon.

56:20.422 --> 56:23.090
- Still with me on what we talked about?
- Yeah, I got it.

56:23.092 --> 56:24.991
I just see you
training with him a lot.

56:24.993 --> 56:26.125
Just makin' sure.

56:26.127 --> 56:27.828
Don't worry about it.

56:27.830 --> 56:29.898
Keep your friends close,
keep your enemies closer.

56:32.868 --> 56:34.368
- Don't pinch him.
- I'm not, I'm not.

56:34.370 --> 56:36.069
- I've got it.
- All right.

56:36.071 --> 56:37.271
- It's not too tight, is it?
- No.

56:37.273 --> 56:39.173
Oh, good.

56:39.175 --> 56:41.309
- Hon?
- Yeah?

56:41.311 --> 56:42.945
Do you think
now's a good time?

56:49.051 --> 56:51.052
Yeah, yes, I do.

56:51.054 --> 56:53.021
Do you remember Rebecca?

56:53.023 --> 56:54.391
Yeah, she's my wife.

56:55.958 --> 56:57.227
Well, she's...

56:58.395 --> 57:00.263
she was your fiancée.

57:03.366 --> 57:04.868
She didn't make it.

57:06.903 --> 57:07.937
She died,

57:09.272 --> 57:11.105
Luke,
in the car accident.

57:11.107 --> 57:12.206
No, no.

57:12.208 --> 57:13.641
- No! No!
- They said it was quick.

57:13.643 --> 57:15.076
- No, no, no!
- They said she...

57:15.078 --> 57:16.345
- No, no, no!
- Luke, it's okay.

57:16.347 --> 57:19.648
- No! No!
- Luke, it's okay.

57:19.650 --> 57:22.085
God, no!

57:41.138 --> 57:42.973
Ah! There goes
the miracle.

57:44.408 --> 57:46.275
Why are they
calling me that?

57:46.277 --> 57:48.277
Because you are
a miracle, Luke.

57:48.279 --> 57:50.979
You are a miracle.

57:50.981 --> 57:53.383
They didn't expect you to live,
and in less than two months,

57:53.385 --> 57:54.453
you're going home.

57:56.487 --> 57:58.089
Thank you.

58:00.257 --> 58:03.526
Dad! This is what I'm
gonna do to help you guys.

58:03.528 --> 58:06.696
- What?
- I'll win this to help with Luke's bills.

58:06.698 --> 58:09.532
Oh, that's great, son,
but it's really not up to you.

58:09.534 --> 58:11.534
No, I wanna help you, Dad.

58:11.536 --> 58:13.268
I'm gonna help you.

58:13.270 --> 58:15.006
- Okay.
- Ben, wait.

58:16.274 --> 58:18.475
- Can I ride with Ben?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

58:18.477 --> 58:21.211
No, it's okay.
Come on. Come on.

58:21.213 --> 58:24.381
- Get your brother.
- Oh, okay.

58:24.383 --> 58:27.951
- All right.
- All right, let's go.

58:27.953 --> 58:29.354
Can you take me
to Rebecca's?

58:31.356 --> 58:35.460
- Luke... She's... not...
- I know.

01:00:06.387 --> 01:00:07.988
You all right?

01:00:11.391 --> 01:00:12.493
What'd you say?

01:00:16.231 --> 01:00:17.465
That I'm sorry.

01:00:22.337 --> 01:00:24.037
Sorry for what I've done.

01:00:29.344 --> 01:00:31.312
How much do you remember
about the accident?

01:00:33.147 --> 01:00:34.582
Just... nothing.

01:00:37.085 --> 01:00:38.152
Nothing.

01:00:46.695 --> 01:00:48.494
Luke, I gotta tell you
something.

01:00:48.496 --> 01:00:51.333
There's things
that you don't know.

01:00:52.334 --> 01:00:55.471
Just... you don't remember.

01:00:56.272 --> 01:00:57.304
What?

01:00:57.306 --> 01:00:59.408
Oh, God, this is hard.

01:01:00.174 --> 01:01:01.342
What, Ben?

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.180
It was...

01:01:09.451 --> 01:01:11.253
it was my fault.

01:01:13.188 --> 01:01:15.188
Hey, I'm legit, man.

01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:16.658
You always have to be the star.

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:19.459
Nah, some things
come naturally.

01:01:19.461 --> 01:01:22.329
Yeah, I get it.
You being a jerk is natural.

01:01:22.331 --> 01:01:25.632
Okay, boys, this is
not double-date talk.

01:01:25.634 --> 01:01:27.335
Please don't
ruin the night.

01:01:27.337 --> 01:01:28.736
Stop.

01:01:28.738 --> 01:01:30.307
You just wait.

01:01:31.474 --> 01:01:34.241
In my pro fights,
I'm gonna be making more jack than you.

01:01:36.445 --> 01:01:38.211
You're gonna make
more jack than me?

01:01:38.213 --> 01:01:39.516
You're just a wannabe,
though.

01:01:51.629 --> 01:01:54.329
I couldn't handle it
anymore.

01:01:54.331 --> 01:01:58.234
And I punched you
with everything I got.

01:02:01.771 --> 01:02:06.408
Luke...
Luke, I am so sorry.

01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:09.545
Luke, I am so sorry.
Can you...

01:02:09.547 --> 01:02:11.714
Look at what
you've done to me.

01:02:11.716 --> 01:02:14.217
I have half a head!

01:02:15.286 --> 01:02:17.386
You killed Rebecca!

01:02:17.388 --> 01:02:20.656
I didn't mean to kill her!
I didn't mean to hurt anyone!

01:02:20.658 --> 01:02:22.725
You destroyed my life!

01:02:22.727 --> 01:02:24.260
Take me home!

01:02:34.405 --> 01:02:38.240
I can't handle it!

01:02:38.242 --> 01:02:39.409
Luke? Luke!

01:02:39.411 --> 01:02:41.343
He killed her!

01:02:41.345 --> 01:02:43.445
- Daniel! What are you talking about?
- He killed her!

01:02:43.447 --> 01:02:45.749
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:48.384
What are you talking about?

01:02:48.386 --> 01:02:50.687
Nothing happened to him.
He should have died!

01:02:50.689 --> 01:02:52.355
- Daniel!
- He should have died.

01:02:52.357 --> 01:02:53.657
Luke?

01:02:53.659 --> 01:02:55.558
- Luke?
- Benjamin!

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.629
He hit me and he
caused this accident.

01:03:04.703 --> 01:03:07.303
I didn't mean
to hurt anyone.

01:03:07.305 --> 01:03:11.608
I tried to explain that to him,
and he was so angry.

01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:13.645
He just wanted to leave.

01:03:15.782 --> 01:03:17.715
I knew you were mad at him.

01:03:17.717 --> 01:03:20.417
But I did not know
you punched him.

01:03:20.419 --> 01:03:23.453
I was so angry at him.

01:03:23.455 --> 01:03:25.789
I couldn't handle it anymore!

01:03:25.791 --> 01:03:29.860
Oh, you couldn't handle it?
Huh?

01:03:29.862 --> 01:03:32.295
Look what you've
put us all through!

01:03:32.297 --> 01:03:33.731
Look what you did to Luke!

01:03:36.268 --> 01:03:38.336
Rebecca's dead!

01:03:40.506 --> 01:03:41.607
She's dead.

01:03:47.313 --> 01:03:49.582
I may never dance again
because of you.

01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:57.623
Leave.
I can't even look at you.

01:03:58.891 --> 01:04:00.359
Go!

01:04:02.796 --> 01:04:04.863
You are such a screw-up!

01:04:04.865 --> 01:04:08.299
You hurt everyone!
You hurt everyone!

01:04:08.301 --> 01:04:10.669
Luke doesn't have a head!
Rebecca's dead!

01:04:10.671 --> 01:04:13.771
Ashley can't even
freakin' dance!

01:04:13.773 --> 01:04:16.608
She can't dance!
You screwed up everything!

01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:19.377
You screwed up!

01:04:19.379 --> 01:04:20.712
There we go, bring it up.

01:04:20.714 --> 01:04:22.614
Cross.

01:04:22.616 --> 01:04:25.449
It's your time, man.
It's your time.

01:04:25.451 --> 01:04:26.788
- You have no idea.
- Look straight.

01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:29.758
- One, two, one now.
- I gotta have this.

01:04:30.557 --> 01:04:31.924
Oh, yeah!

01:04:31.926 --> 01:04:34.726
If you remember your
training, you got this.

01:04:34.728 --> 01:04:36.495
Upper cut,
look straight.

01:04:36.497 --> 01:04:39.332
Yes, sir.

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:42.467
You got two fights tonight.
Don't get injured.

01:04:42.469 --> 01:04:44.637
You got one hour
in between each fight.

01:04:44.639 --> 01:04:46.438
Okay? One more time
for your mind.

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:47.539
One, two.

01:04:47.541 --> 01:04:48.941
Pow, pow! There we go.

01:04:48.943 --> 01:04:50.310
- We're ready.
- Whoo!

01:04:53.114 --> 01:04:55.416
<i>Look what
you put us all through!</i>

01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:01.654
<i>Look at what you've done to me.</i>

01:05:01.656 --> 01:05:03.859
<i>I have half a head!</i>

01:05:07.929 --> 01:05:09.962
<i>You killed Rebecca!</i>

01:05:18.841 --> 01:05:20.475
All right, fighters,
bring it in.

01:05:23.845 --> 01:05:25.745
All right,
protect yourselves at all times.

01:05:25.747 --> 01:05:27.614
Listen to my commands
at all times.

01:05:27.616 --> 01:05:28.715
Any questions?

01:05:28.717 --> 01:05:30.951
- No.
- Touch gloves.

01:05:30.953 --> 01:05:32.454
Back to your corners.

01:05:36.658 --> 01:05:39.160
Fighters, you ready?
You good? You ready?

01:05:39.162 --> 01:05:40.396
All right, fight!

01:05:44.466 --> 01:05:45.933
Let's go!
Hit him with that one, two!

01:05:45.935 --> 01:05:48.836
Come on, come on, come on!
You be first, man.

01:05:51.641 --> 01:05:52.943
In and out. In and out.

01:05:54.543 --> 01:05:57.711
Protect yourself.
Protect yourself on the way out!

01:06:04.621 --> 01:06:06.621
There we go. There we go!

01:06:06.623 --> 01:06:08.424
You gotta set in next time.

01:06:09.726 --> 01:06:10.792
Come on, come on, come on!

01:06:19.569 --> 01:06:21.371
Have a sit-down, son.

01:06:23.439 --> 01:06:24.906
Give me your mouth guard.

01:06:24.908 --> 01:06:28.043
Come on, Ben.
You're better than this.

01:06:28.045 --> 01:06:31.479
Get your head straight,
okay?

01:06:31.481 --> 01:06:32.682
Take a couple
sips of water.

01:06:35.919 --> 01:06:38.723
Ben, get him
to the ground.

01:06:41.524 --> 01:06:44.729
All right.
Give me his mouth guard.

01:06:45.930 --> 01:06:48.529
There we go.
You ready to go?

01:06:48.531 --> 01:06:49.799
All right, let's go.
Get up.

01:06:55.873 --> 01:06:57.642
Come on, be confident!

01:07:00.845 --> 01:07:02.546
Are you ready?

01:07:04.016 --> 01:07:06.249
Are you ready?

01:07:06.251 --> 01:07:07.652
All right, fight!

01:07:08.519 --> 01:07:09.854
Let's go, Ben.

01:07:11.989 --> 01:07:13.958
That's what I'm talkin' about,
right there!

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.492
That's the ticket.

01:07:16.494 --> 01:07:17.930
Get him to the ground!

01:07:23.968 --> 01:07:25.968
Come on,
get you in there!

01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:27.506
It's your time, Ben.

01:07:29.942 --> 01:07:31.875
Oh, yeah!

01:07:34.913 --> 01:07:36.779
Whoa, whoa! Hey! Hey!

01:07:36.781 --> 01:07:39.582
Now, that's a knockout!

01:07:39.584 --> 01:07:42.085
- That's it.
- Hey, thanks.

01:07:45.757 --> 01:07:48.825
The winner by knockout
in the second round,

01:07:48.827 --> 01:07:51.696
Benjamin
"The Favorite" Bernard!

01:07:51.698 --> 01:07:53.598
Yes, sir!

01:08:03.576 --> 01:08:07.011
Mm, mm, mm.
Great fight, Ben.

01:08:07.013 --> 01:08:09.780
I could not believe
that last round.

01:08:09.782 --> 01:08:14.487
Yeah, I... There's something I'm gonna
have to leave and go do. I just...

01:08:14.921 --> 01:08:16.020
- Leave?
- Yeah.

01:08:16.022 --> 01:08:17.621
What's wrong?
You gotta leave?

01:08:17.622 --> 01:08:20.660
I'll know once I
make this phone call.

01:08:22.028 --> 01:08:24.028
Ben, look at me, son.

01:08:24.029 --> 01:08:26.630
I ain't never left
a soldier behind.

01:08:26.631 --> 01:08:29.836
But if you leave,
I'm not gonna be in that corner with you.

01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:32.072
You think about that.

01:09:15.716 --> 01:09:17.183
- Honey, have you seen Ben?
- Hi.

01:09:17.185 --> 01:09:18.951
Yes, he just
stormed through here.

01:09:18.953 --> 01:09:22.720
- What?
- Don't worry. I got all my stuff now.

01:09:22.723 --> 01:09:24.089
No!

01:09:24.091 --> 01:09:26.926
Mom asked you to come
to my fights this month and...

01:09:26.928 --> 01:09:29.095
it was fine you didn't show.

01:09:29.096 --> 01:09:30.930
But my tournament pro fight?

01:09:30.932 --> 01:09:32.732
The biggest fight of my life!

01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:35.167
- And you still don't show.
- Ben! Benjamin!

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:37.072
- No, no, no!
- Hey, listen to me.

01:09:38.038 --> 01:09:39.075
Let me finish.

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:43.011
You've always
put him first.

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:46.112
- What?
- I get it.

01:09:46.113 --> 01:09:52.152
The favorite Lukitus
always gets the very best.

01:09:52.154 --> 01:09:53.720
While the rest of us...

01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:55.990
nothing.

01:09:57.892 --> 01:10:00.193
Nothing! You, society, God!

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:03.697
You leave the rest of us to figure
out everything in this world alone!

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:05.732
What are you talking about?

01:10:05.734 --> 01:10:07.870
Your mother and I have always been
there for you, for both of you.

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:11.739
When will you ever stop?

01:10:13.775 --> 01:10:18.047
You took Rebecca from me.
You took everything from me!

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:22.184
Yeah, I screwed up.

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:26.921
But...
no matter what I do...

01:10:26.923 --> 01:10:29.025
or how good a son I am...

01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:33.062
none of it matters.

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:40.268
Nothing I do will ever
be good enough for you!

01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:42.239
And when I need you
the most...

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:46.009
you weren't there for me.

01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:49.210
Ben! Benjamin!

01:10:49.212 --> 01:10:52.048
I was there.

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:56.953
You're never there!

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.134
Get it together.

01:11:14.004 --> 01:11:15.938
You don't need anyone
in your corner.

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:19.175
Get it together!

01:11:31.088 --> 01:11:32.223
See your hands.

01:11:37.228 --> 01:11:38.996
Come on, baby. It's time.

01:11:44.536 --> 01:11:47.970
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's do this!

01:11:47.972 --> 01:11:51.975
The final match, winner take
all, round robin tournament.

01:11:51.977 --> 01:11:55.111
One of these fighters
is going out of here

01:11:55.113 --> 01:11:58.814
with $10,000.

01:12:00.385 --> 01:12:03.053
Sponsored by promoter
Conner Fraser.

01:12:03.055 --> 01:12:04.354
Let's do this!

01:12:04.356 --> 01:12:07.557
In the blue corner,
six feet, one inches tall,

01:12:07.559 --> 01:12:10.160
Los Angeles, California
is his home.

01:12:10.162 --> 01:12:13.196
With a record of ten wins
and one loss,

01:12:13.198 --> 01:12:17.200
Michael "Venom" Daley!

01:12:19.805 --> 01:12:23.340
And in the red corner,
five feet, eleven inches tall,

01:12:23.342 --> 01:12:25.141
from Tampa Bay, Florida.

01:12:25.143 --> 01:12:28.912
With a record of 12 wins,
two losses,

01:12:28.914 --> 01:12:33.284
Benjamin
"The Favorite" Bernard!

01:12:38.825 --> 01:12:40.760
Fighters,
come into the circle.

01:12:43.096 --> 01:12:46.896
All right, fighters, listen.
Protect yourselves at all times.

01:12:46.898 --> 01:12:48.932
Listen to my commands
at all times.

01:12:48.934 --> 01:12:50.167
Any questions?

01:12:50.169 --> 01:12:51.804
- No.
- Touch gloves.

01:12:53.072 --> 01:12:54.307
Back to your corners.

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:07.854
Fighter, are you ready?

01:13:08.389 --> 01:13:10.187
Fighter, you ready?

01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:11.224
Bring it!

01:13:38.353 --> 01:13:40.187
Get him down. Down.

01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:49.094
Time! Time! Time! Break it up.

01:13:49.096 --> 01:13:51.397
Break it up! Time!

01:13:51.399 --> 01:13:54.269
Back to your corners.
Fighters, back to your corners.

01:14:01.342 --> 01:14:03.109
Listen, don't let him
take you down.

01:14:03.111 --> 01:14:05.178
The only way he can beat you
is on the ground, all right?

01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:07.282
- I can't stop his takedowns.
- Get him down.

01:14:08.516 --> 01:14:10.350
Hey, he can't handle
the southpaw.

01:14:10.352 --> 01:14:12.185
You're a southpaw.
You're too fast for him.

01:14:12.187 --> 01:14:13.288
All right? Do it.

01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:24.232
Let's do it, come on.

01:14:27.436 --> 01:14:29.171
Coaches, lock it up.

01:14:29.971 --> 01:14:31.407
Fighters, you ready?

01:14:33.007 --> 01:14:34.008
Ready, fight!

01:14:57.433 --> 01:14:59.068
Get him down!

01:15:15.018 --> 01:15:16.451
Get him down
to the ground.

01:15:16.453 --> 01:15:19.053
I can't take him down.

01:15:19.055 --> 01:15:21.054
You have to
get him down, son.

01:15:21.056 --> 01:15:22.359
Stick to the plan.

01:15:31.468 --> 01:15:33.270
Fighters, you ready?

01:15:34.204 --> 01:15:35.336
Get some!

01:16:00.263 --> 01:16:03.234
Pick it up!
Pick it up! You got this!

01:16:31.062 --> 01:16:33.430
All right, that's it, that's it!
Time! Time! That's it!

01:16:33.432 --> 01:16:35.264
Fight's over.
Fight's over.

01:16:35.266 --> 01:16:36.601
Back to your corners.

01:16:38.604 --> 01:16:41.371
Ladies and gentlemen,
after three rounds,

01:16:41.373 --> 01:16:44.407
we go to the judges' score
cards for a decision.

01:16:44.409 --> 01:16:48.545
The first judge
scores the bout Daley.

01:16:48.547 --> 01:16:52.249
The second judge
scores it Bernard.

01:16:52.251 --> 01:16:54.484
And the final judge
scores it,

01:16:54.486 --> 01:16:57.489
and the winner
by a split decision...

01:16:58.423 --> 01:17:01.025
Michael "Venom" Daley!

01:17:24.551 --> 01:17:26.319
I can't believe you
called him.

01:17:27.153 --> 01:17:28.254
I tell you about that.

01:17:34.527 --> 01:17:36.427
I can't believe
I lost to this poseur.

01:17:36.429 --> 01:17:39.466
Oh, yeah? Well, this poseur
knocked you out, how 'bout that?

01:17:45.906 --> 01:17:47.371
Ben!

01:17:47.373 --> 01:17:49.509
Hey! Get off of my son!

01:17:52.279 --> 01:17:54.415
Benjamin!

01:18:43.798 --> 01:18:46.399
<i>Oh,
there he is, our soccer champ.</i>

01:18:46.401 --> 01:18:48.568
It's okay, hey...

01:18:48.570 --> 01:18:50.704
- All right, I got you.
- Oh, my God, what happened?

01:18:50.706 --> 01:18:52.538
Some guys jumped us.
Get some ice, Mom.

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:55.742
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:18:55.744 --> 01:18:57.978
All right, all right, all right.

01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:00.413
Ben. Benjamin, I'm okay.

01:19:00.415 --> 01:19:01.614
Okay, all right.

01:19:01.616 --> 01:19:04.219
I'm a little dizzy.

01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:06.687
- Daniel!
- Hi.

01:19:06.689 --> 01:19:08.689
- Hon, are you all right?
- I'm... Ow, ow!

01:19:08.691 --> 01:19:10.590
- Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?
- Yes, yes.

01:19:10.592 --> 01:19:13.727
Well, there was a...
there was a disagreement after the fight.

01:19:13.729 --> 01:19:15.529
Oh, my gosh.
Luke, do you have those?

01:19:15.531 --> 01:19:18.399
Let me see those.
Here, help me hold that up. Here.

01:19:18.401 --> 01:19:21.502
<i>Let's go, guys, let's go!</i>

01:19:21.504 --> 01:19:24.437
<i>Come on, Lukitus! Yeah!</i>

01:19:24.439 --> 01:19:26.675
<i>Who's behind you, buddy?</i>

01:19:26.677 --> 01:19:28.709
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:19:28.711 --> 01:19:31.378
<i>Look who got his white belt
first day of karate!</i>

01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:33.480
<i>Ben, look here,
give us a little punch. Just a punch.</i>

01:19:33.482 --> 01:19:34.648
<i>Perfect! All right.</i>

01:19:36.419 --> 01:19:37.786
<i>I'll go get my keys.
I'm gonna take him, okay?</i>

01:19:37.788 --> 01:19:39.353
<i>Beat ya.
I'm gonna take him. I want to.</i>

01:19:39.355 --> 01:19:40.789
<i>See you in the car, buddy.</i>

01:19:40.791 --> 01:19:43.592
- <i>Hiya!</i>
- <i>That's perfect.</i>

01:20:01.813 --> 01:20:03.445
<i>Luke, come on,</i>

01:20:03.447 --> 01:20:04.813
<i>you know you didn't have
to get me anything.</i>

01:20:04.815 --> 01:20:07.348
- <i>I signed it.</i>
- <i>You did!</i>

01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:09.884
<i>Whatever could it be?</i>

01:20:09.886 --> 01:20:12.754
- <i>Well, you think it's a ball.</i>
- <i>I think maybe it's a ball, okay.</i>

01:20:12.756 --> 01:20:15.626
<i>All right, I'm gonna open it up.
Let me see here.</i>

01:20:16.359 --> 01:20:18.295
<i>Wow! It is...</i>

01:20:18.896 --> 01:20:20.395
<i>absolutely perfect.</i>

01:20:20.397 --> 01:20:22.297
<i>Everything I want.</i>

01:20:22.299 --> 01:20:24.399
<i>Thank you very much,
buddy.</i>

01:20:24.401 --> 01:20:25.768
- <i>That's...</i>
- <i>Dad, do you like it?</i>

01:20:25.770 --> 01:20:28.637
<i>I made it myself
so you can play too!</i>

01:20:28.639 --> 01:20:30.439
- <i>You did?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:20:30.441 --> 01:20:32.608
<i>Well, what did you make yourself?
Let's see.</i>

01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:35.643
<i>Whoa! It looks like
you made them yourself.</i>

01:20:35.645 --> 01:20:38.282
<i>Doesn't it, Mom?
Doesn't it, huh?</i>

01:20:39.383 --> 01:20:41.751
<i>"Ben fights for Dad."</i>

01:20:41.753 --> 01:20:43.686
<i>Absolutely perfect.</i>

01:20:43.688 --> 01:20:45.387
<i>Can we go
kick it around now?</i>

01:20:45.389 --> 01:20:48.325
<i>Sure, sure, go, go, go!
Go, go!</i>

01:21:02.541 --> 01:21:04.474
<i>What are you
doing that for?</i>

01:21:04.476 --> 01:21:07.443
<i>Oh, I'm gonna hang it up
on the wall out here</i>

01:21:07.445 --> 01:21:10.546
<i>so I can see it every day.</i>

01:21:10.548 --> 01:21:11.716
Wait.

01:21:21.727 --> 01:21:22.895
<i>Ta-da!</i>

01:21:27.666 --> 01:21:29.434
- <i>Nice.</i>
- That's...

01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:04.504
I can't believe it.

01:22:06.606 --> 01:22:08.639
I can't believe this.

01:22:40.574 --> 01:22:41.742
Dad.

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:47.413
It's crazy.

01:22:48.549 --> 01:22:49.684
God.

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.387
God.

01:23:02.564 --> 01:23:03.598
God.

01:23:08.602 --> 01:23:09.804
I was wrong.

01:23:13.675 --> 01:23:15.944
Wrong about my dad.

01:23:20.081 --> 01:23:21.716
Wrong about you.

01:23:27.589 --> 01:23:32.694
I saw what you
did for Luke and Ashley...

01:23:36.831 --> 01:23:39.568
I want that relationship
they got with you.

01:23:46.075 --> 01:23:48.677
I'm... fighting everyone.

01:23:51.914 --> 01:23:53.582
And you...

01:24:00.056 --> 01:24:01.789
Why do you love me?

01:24:01.791 --> 01:24:04.694
Why?

01:24:05.728 --> 01:24:08.064
I'm such a screw-up.

01:24:16.006 --> 01:24:17.673
I'm sorry, God.

01:24:20.743 --> 01:24:22.611
I'm sorry for everything.

01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:28.752
Forgive me, Jesus.

01:24:30.754 --> 01:24:32.488
I'm truly sorry.

01:24:36.926 --> 01:24:38.528
You healed Luke.

01:24:42.966 --> 01:24:44.034
Heal me.

01:24:46.336 --> 01:24:47.671
Heal me.

01:24:51.575 --> 01:24:52.743
My dad...

01:25:00.817 --> 01:25:01.853
Dad.

01:25:06.958 --> 01:25:08.092
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:25:17.802 --> 01:25:19.035
- Dad...
- No, no, no.

01:25:19.037 --> 01:25:21.739
Hang on a second, okay?
I think...

01:25:22.907 --> 01:25:26.045
I think it's my turn to talk.
I earned that.

01:25:26.979 --> 01:25:28.078
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.645
I mean, look at me.

01:25:29.647 --> 01:25:31.049
Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:33.051 --> 01:25:37.021
Son, I can't be
everywhere all the time.

01:25:37.890 --> 01:25:39.024
I'm not God.

01:25:40.893 --> 01:25:42.959
Okay? Now...

01:25:42.961 --> 01:25:46.898
now, your brother was easy to relate
to, but you, not so much.

01:25:48.032 --> 01:25:50.667
Hey, hey. You...

01:25:50.669 --> 01:25:53.972
somehow think
that I favor your brother.

01:25:56.208 --> 01:25:58.811
Son, it's not favoritism,
it's a relationship.

01:25:59.845 --> 01:26:01.778
It's the same kind
of relationship

01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:03.914
that I've always wanted to have with
you, but for some reason...

01:26:03.916 --> 01:26:05.682
I realized that when
you took those hits for me.

01:26:05.684 --> 01:26:06.952
- It's just...
- Yes!

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:10.654
It's what fathers
do, Benjamin.

01:26:10.656 --> 01:26:12.823
No, it's what fathers do
who love their kids.

01:26:12.825 --> 01:26:17.261
Oh. I don't care
if you're an MMA fighter.

01:26:17.263 --> 01:26:19.430
I don't care
if you're a soccer player.

01:26:19.432 --> 01:26:21.898
I don't care if you're
a clown in the circus.

01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:25.839
I don't care if you're any good
at any of that stuff. I love you.

01:26:27.874 --> 01:26:32.611
Okay? I love... this.

01:26:34.013 --> 01:26:36.049
I love you.

01:26:37.251 --> 01:26:41.020
And I have loved you from
the moment you were born.

01:26:42.856 --> 01:26:44.090
Because you are mine.

01:26:46.025 --> 01:26:47.227
You're my son.

01:26:48.461 --> 01:26:51.764
Benjamin, you are my son,
and I love you.

01:26:54.767 --> 01:26:56.901
I love you too, Dad.

01:26:56.903 --> 01:26:59.003
Don't you dare make me cry.
It hurts.

01:26:59.005 --> 01:27:02.074
Don't you dare. Oh, don't make me laugh.
It hurts more.

01:27:02.076 --> 01:27:04.042
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:27:04.044 --> 01:27:06.078
Okay, would you,
on the back?

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.745
- All right?
- Okay. Oh.

01:27:07.747 --> 01:27:09.814
- Is that... all right?
- Yeah.

01:27:12.119 --> 01:27:14.188
All right,
let's take a look here.

01:27:18.493 --> 01:27:20.094
Hold that for me, please.

01:27:25.833 --> 01:27:28.101
Looking good.
Any headaches?

01:27:28.103 --> 01:27:30.203
No. None.

01:27:30.205 --> 01:27:32.871
So are you ready to get rid
of that helmet for good?

01:27:32.873 --> 01:27:34.239
Absolutely.

01:27:34.241 --> 01:27:36.808
You said that he might
have to wear it for a year.

01:27:36.810 --> 01:27:38.044
It's only been
a few months.

01:27:38.046 --> 01:27:40.280
I checked. He's ready
for a cranioplasty.

01:27:40.282 --> 01:27:41.848
That is,
unless you want to wait.

01:27:41.850 --> 01:27:43.116
Let's do it.

01:27:43.118 --> 01:27:45.151
Okay, let me
check my schedule.

01:27:49.023 --> 01:27:51.090
We have an opening
the 18th, next week.

01:27:51.092 --> 01:27:53.259
Yeah. Yes.

01:27:53.261 --> 01:27:55.895
- You available?
- Yes!

01:27:55.897 --> 01:27:57.797
- What's wrong?
- It's a miracle.

01:27:57.799 --> 01:27:59.733
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Sounds good.

01:28:02.205 --> 01:28:04.003
Impressive!

01:28:04.005 --> 01:28:05.838
I used to box when I was a
kid, you know that, right?

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.110
Yeah. We'll call you Neo,
I didn't even see those.

01:28:10.078 --> 01:28:11.244
What does that mean?

01:28:11.246 --> 01:28:14.951
Come on, Dad.
<i>The Matrix?</i> Neo?

01:28:15.551 --> 01:28:17.086
- I got nothin'.
- Ah!

01:28:17.953 --> 01:28:20.221
Tell you what,
call me S.A.

01:28:20.223 --> 01:28:22.789
Uh, <i>no hablo español.</i>

01:28:22.791 --> 01:28:26.360
No, no, not Spanish, silly.
S.A., Superior Athlete.

01:28:26.362 --> 01:28:28.264
G.S., Genetic Superior.

01:28:29.131 --> 01:28:31.031
And Mom thinks I'm cocky?

01:28:31.033 --> 01:28:33.202
- Your mom isn't here right now, is she?
- No, she isn't.

01:28:35.137 --> 01:28:36.303
- Ben?
- Yeah?

01:28:36.305 --> 01:28:38.273
Some good news
came in.

01:28:38.275 --> 01:28:40.241
Okay, what's up?

01:28:40.243 --> 01:28:44.111
They're overturning the judge's
decision 'cause Michael cheated.

01:28:44.113 --> 01:28:47.281
They found out that somebody
rubbed some Vaseline on him.

01:28:47.283 --> 01:28:49.853
- What does that mean for me?
- A rematch.

01:28:51.255 --> 01:28:52.920
What do you guys think?
You in?

01:28:52.922 --> 01:28:55.122
- Schedule it.
- All right, I'm gonna call it in.

01:28:55.124 --> 01:28:56.424
- All right!
- Let's do it!

01:28:56.426 --> 01:28:59.026
<i>Oh!
There he is, our soccer champ.</i>

01:28:59.028 --> 01:29:01.198
<i>Luke, Luke,
say hi to the camera.</i>

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:04.933
- <i>Hey, buddy.</i>
- That's good.

01:29:04.935 --> 01:29:06.234
- <i>How's the game going?</i>
- That's good.

01:29:06.236 --> 01:29:08.036
- This is so cool.
- Yeah.

01:29:08.038 --> 01:29:09.937
I think we have a couple more of those.
More to play.

01:29:09.939 --> 01:29:11.172
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey.

01:29:11.174 --> 01:29:13.174
- Benjamin!
- Mom, Dad.

01:29:13.176 --> 01:29:14.876
Luke.

01:29:14.878 --> 01:29:17.247
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

01:29:19.182 --> 01:29:20.382
I know you're
doing videos,

01:29:20.384 --> 01:29:23.053
but can I talk to Luke
for a second?

01:29:24.421 --> 01:29:27.889
- Yeah, absolutely. You two need to talk.
- Of course, baby, yeah.

01:29:27.891 --> 01:29:28.959
All right?

01:29:32.062 --> 01:29:33.930
We'll get back
to this later, okay?

01:29:37.435 --> 01:29:40.004
Luke, hey, man.

01:29:45.042 --> 01:29:46.244
So...

01:29:49.213 --> 01:29:51.347
how much longer
until you're fully recovered?

01:29:51.349 --> 01:29:55.184
- You're at what, 80%?
- I feel like I'm 100.

01:29:55.186 --> 01:29:58.256
Yeah, right, 100.

01:30:00.391 --> 01:30:03.228
Hey...
will you come with me?

01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:07.198
I want you to meet
someone at Tapp'd Out.

01:30:09.967 --> 01:30:11.102
Is Ashley
gonna be there?

01:30:14.106 --> 01:30:15.974
She isn't talking to me.

01:30:25.217 --> 01:30:26.251
All right.

01:30:27.986 --> 01:30:31.088
Just give me a sec.
I'll meet you at the truck.

01:30:31.090 --> 01:30:33.258
Okay. Great.

01:30:41.266 --> 01:30:43.400
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

01:30:43.402 --> 01:30:46.136
Hey, I wanted to show you
the miracle.

01:30:46.138 --> 01:30:49.273
Oh, well, it's nice to meet
you, Miracle.

01:30:49.275 --> 01:30:52.543
Please, please, call me by my
nickname, which is Luke.

01:30:52.545 --> 01:30:54.247
- Hmm. Okay.
- Oh, gosh.

01:30:55.281 --> 01:30:57.182
So it's been
under six months.

01:30:58.283 --> 01:30:59.351
- Well...
- Actually...

01:31:00.285 --> 01:31:02.253
Give it, yeah.

01:31:02.255 --> 01:31:04.288
- Rare chip.
- Yeah.

01:31:04.290 --> 01:31:06.557
- I think this belongs to you.
- It does.

01:31:06.559 --> 01:31:07.427
Thank you.

01:31:10.028 --> 01:31:12.131
So this is why Luke
wanted me to come in.

01:31:13.467 --> 01:31:17.435
Ashley.
Ash, wait! I've changed!

01:31:17.437 --> 01:31:19.172
I want...

01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:22.540
- I want...
- What do you want, Ben?

01:31:22.542 --> 01:31:25.043
- I want...
- What do you want?

01:31:25.045 --> 01:31:28.449
I want you, okay?
I want you!

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:32.952
None of it matters
if I don't have you.

01:31:34.588 --> 01:31:36.122
Ashley...

01:31:37.391 --> 01:31:38.426
I love you.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:46.300
Ben... I never knew that
I could love somebody so much

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:50.337
and hate them just the same.

01:31:58.446 --> 01:32:00.245
Luke, no!

01:32:00.247 --> 01:32:02.047
Come here. Come here.

01:32:02.049 --> 01:32:03.215
- You okay?
- Yes, of course.

01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:04.484
I need some help
with something.

01:32:04.486 --> 01:32:07.554
- That's your mom.
- She's a smart lady.

01:32:07.556 --> 01:32:10.090
Yeah, that's why
I married her.

01:32:10.792 --> 01:32:13.359
Well, good thing
opposites attract.

01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:15.963
Yeah, that's funny.

01:32:17.232 --> 01:32:19.131
It kinda is.

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:20.268
A little bit.

01:32:24.371 --> 01:32:25.472
There we go.

01:32:25.474 --> 01:32:26.807
- Yeah.
- Whoa, whoa.

01:32:26.809 --> 01:32:28.243
- That a spot?
- No, no, no.

01:32:29.244 --> 01:32:31.046
Got a spot. Hey!

01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:33.279
- Yep.
- Come on.

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:34.282
Let's get it.

01:32:35.082 --> 01:32:36.382
- All right.
- Okay.

01:32:45.193 --> 01:32:46.359
Good job.

01:32:46.361 --> 01:32:48.161
- You too.
- Thank you.

01:32:48.163 --> 01:32:53.132
Did come through
as a pretty nice diamond.

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:54.602
- Not in the rough anymore.
- Not in the rough.

01:32:54.604 --> 01:32:57.170
No, no, no.
Here. Give me five.

01:32:57.172 --> 01:32:58.438
- I didn't even try.
- Give me five.

01:32:58.440 --> 01:32:59.840
- I didn't even try.
- Wha-pow!

01:32:59.842 --> 01:33:02.144
- Give me five.
- Hands like feet.

01:33:04.213 --> 01:33:07.281
So I thought maybe now
would be a good time

01:33:07.283 --> 01:33:10.417
to start working
on that project car of yours.

01:33:10.419 --> 01:33:14.290
- Really? You're gonna help me now?
- Yeah, finally.

01:33:15.157 --> 01:33:16.425
All right, let's do it.

01:33:19.529 --> 01:33:23.065
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:33:24.267 --> 01:33:25.302
It's done.

01:33:26.603 --> 01:33:28.372
Yeah, man, all for you.

01:33:29.171 --> 01:33:30.672
Everything works?

01:33:30.674 --> 01:33:32.574
Of course!

01:33:32.576 --> 01:33:35.710
Let's take it for a ride.
Let's go down to the coast.

01:33:35.712 --> 01:33:39.614
How did you do this?
When did you do this?

01:33:39.616 --> 01:33:42.417
Well, I had
a little help.

01:33:45.489 --> 01:33:47.558
This is amazing. Uh...

01:33:52.195 --> 01:33:53.695
- Let's hope it runs, right?
- Shut up!

01:33:53.697 --> 01:33:55.599
Here, get in the car.

01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:58.468
Have fun, guys.

01:34:02.172 --> 01:34:03.307
Whoo!

01:34:04.576 --> 01:34:07.344
There it is.

01:34:08.746 --> 01:34:10.213
Yeah.

01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:33.736
- Oh, man.
- Oh, wow.

01:34:33.738 --> 01:34:35.506
- Look at this.
- I missed this spot.

01:34:36.273 --> 01:34:38.711
Whoo. Wow.

01:34:39.612 --> 01:34:41.344
Beautiful.

01:34:41.346 --> 01:34:42.779
Since you guys had
so much fun with that car,

01:34:42.781 --> 01:34:44.347
what do you want to
build next?

01:34:44.349 --> 01:34:46.150
I wanna build...

01:34:48.419 --> 01:34:49.488
a family.

01:34:51.657 --> 01:34:54.358
Whoa.

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.561
All right, all right.
Let's back the love train up a little bit.

01:34:57.563 --> 01:35:00.596
- Yeah?
- Ben, this is huge, man.

01:35:00.598 --> 01:35:02.532
I know.

01:35:02.534 --> 01:35:05.535
All right, so,
how are you gonna ask her?

01:35:05.537 --> 01:35:08.540
Not sure. I haven't even
got a ring, but...

01:35:09.408 --> 01:35:10.974
now might be a bad time.

01:35:10.976 --> 01:35:14.378
So...
hopelessly unromantic.

01:35:19.284 --> 01:35:21.284
Gettin' married.
Oh, man.

01:35:21.286 --> 01:35:22.621
I'm sorry, Luke.
You...

01:35:23.555 --> 01:35:24.822
you should be
marrying Rebecca.

01:35:24.824 --> 01:35:26.259
Well.

01:35:27.293 --> 01:35:30.530
I've come to peace
with the whole accident, and...

01:35:32.766 --> 01:35:36.335
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

01:35:37.637 --> 01:35:39.439
I wasn't
a good big brother, man.

01:35:41.708 --> 01:35:43.443
I was a jerk.

01:35:44.477 --> 01:35:45.578
I love you, man.

01:35:49.282 --> 01:35:50.615
I love you too.

01:35:50.617 --> 01:35:52.450
Whoa!

01:35:52.452 --> 01:35:54.285
- What?
- Calm that grip down.

01:35:54.287 --> 01:35:57.190
- I'm in your corner, big guy.
- It's go time!

01:36:04.498 --> 01:36:05.566
I'm ready.

01:36:08.268 --> 01:36:09.469
I know you are.

01:36:53.648 --> 01:36:55.481
Come here, son.
Let me get you a little help there.

01:36:55.483 --> 01:36:56.716
Right, push through,
right there.

01:36:56.718 --> 01:36:58.550
Come on! There we go.

01:36:58.552 --> 01:37:00.720
- Hey, Ben.
- Get you all strapped in.

01:37:00.722 --> 01:37:02.589
You came.

01:37:02.591 --> 01:37:05.260
Yeah, your dad dragged me here.
He wanted me to give you this.

01:37:06.328 --> 01:37:07.395
Okay...

01:37:12.333 --> 01:37:15.102
Oh.

01:37:15.104 --> 01:37:16.438
What's the note say?

01:37:30.418 --> 01:37:33.488
My dad dragged you here?

01:37:34.824 --> 01:37:39.729
No. I wanted to see
this changed man fight.

01:37:44.567 --> 01:37:47.402
- Fresh start?
- Yeah.

01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:05.856
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:38:39.757 --> 01:38:43.525
Ladies and
gentlemen, big fight tonight.

01:38:43.527 --> 01:38:46.761
This is the rematch
you have waited for.

01:38:46.763 --> 01:38:49.999
We all know the controversy
the first fight ended in.

01:38:50.001 --> 01:38:54.637
The winner here
gets a shot at the title.

01:38:54.639 --> 01:38:55.807
Are we ready?

01:38:57.208 --> 01:38:58.742
Let's do this!

01:39:01.579 --> 01:39:02.945
Fighter, you ready?

01:39:02.947 --> 01:39:04.547
Fighter, you ready?

01:39:04.549 --> 01:39:06.384
Bring it!

01:39:14.927 --> 01:39:16.427
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:39:20.832 --> 01:39:22.798
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
Listen, no eye gouging!

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.469
No eye gouging!

01:39:25.938 --> 01:39:27.638
- Are you okay?
- You all right?

01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:29.675
- You okay? Can you continue?
- Yeah.

01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:32.541
All right,
let's go, let's go!

01:39:32.543 --> 01:39:34.445
Fight!

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:50.527
Time! Time! Time! Time!

01:39:50.529 --> 01:39:51.797
Back to your corners!

01:39:56.969 --> 01:39:59.036
Go out there
and give it everything you got.

01:39:59.038 --> 01:40:01.739
You gotta get him to the ground
and finish him!

01:40:01.741 --> 01:40:02.809
You understand me?

01:40:06.578 --> 01:40:07.981
Let's go, fighters!

01:40:09.082 --> 01:40:10.683
Corners lock it up!

01:40:11.617 --> 01:40:12.719
Fight!

01:40:16.623 --> 01:40:17.889
Hey, watch that kick!

01:40:17.891 --> 01:40:20.026
Last warning.
Last warning and you're out.

01:40:21.094 --> 01:40:22.862
Let's go! Let's go! Fight!

01:40:46.619 --> 01:40:49.088
Time! Time! Time! Time! Time!

01:40:49.090 --> 01:40:50.689
Back to your corners.

01:40:54.962 --> 01:40:56.895
Ben! Hey! Hey!

01:40:56.897 --> 01:40:59.864
He fights dirty,
but you got this, okay?

01:40:59.866 --> 01:41:03.070
You gotta dig deep.
Find it in your heart.

01:41:03.938 --> 01:41:05.039
Now let's go get it done.

01:41:13.115 --> 01:41:14.783
Fighter, you ready?

01:41:15.984 --> 01:41:17.050
Fighter, you ready?

01:41:20.355 --> 01:41:21.622
Bring it!

01:42:02.198 --> 01:42:05.833
Favorite!
Favorite! Favorite!

01:42:05.835 --> 01:42:08.902
Benjamin, you are my son,
and I love you.

01:42:08.904 --> 01:42:11.973
Favorite! Favorite! Favorite!

01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:28.722
- I love you too.
- Favorite! Favorite!

01:42:28.724 --> 01:42:31.058
<i>"Ben fights for Dad."</i>

01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:32.760
<i>Absolutely perfect.</i>

01:42:34.230 --> 01:42:37.065
Favorite! Favorite! Favorite!

01:42:39.136 --> 01:42:41.836
All right, all right,
that's it, that's it!

01:42:45.242 --> 01:42:48.177
Yeah!

01:42:54.885 --> 01:42:56.619
Whoo!

01:45:13.294 --> 01:45:15.160
Somebody like Mr. Bernard,

01:45:15.162 --> 01:45:18.096
who comes in with
a Glasgow Coma Score of three,

01:45:18.098 --> 01:45:19.864
and then, a few months later,

01:45:19.866 --> 01:45:22.967
is walking into
my brain injury clinic,

01:45:22.969 --> 01:45:26.238
I could count those on one hand.

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:32.977
So very, very, very uncommon,
and I hesitate to say the word,

01:45:32.979 --> 01:45:36.915
but, you know, it is almost,
when you see it,

01:45:36.917 --> 01:45:40.121
the first word that comes
in your mind is like miraculous.

01:46:32.474 --> 01:46:35.110
Daniel and Kathy Bernard,

01:46:36.078 --> 01:46:38.979
directors of
Somebody Cares Tampa Bay,

01:46:38.981 --> 01:46:42.249
with their miracle son,
would you welcome Luke tonight.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.105
I'm gonna go ahead
and pray a little bit right now.

01:47:03.407 --> 01:47:05.206
Dear God,

01:47:05.208 --> 01:47:09.110
thank you for all those
who prayed for me to...

01:47:09.112 --> 01:47:10.411
get better.

01:47:10.413 --> 01:47:12.214
I really appreciate it.

01:47:12.216 --> 01:47:14.549
It took me some time
to get better.

01:47:14.551 --> 01:47:16.251
And I really,

01:47:16.253 --> 01:47:20.121
I'm really thankful
for your constant prayers.

01:47:20.123 --> 01:47:23.023
Because it really did end up
changing me.

01:47:23.025 --> 01:47:25.162
And I ended up getting healed.

01:47:26.130 --> 01:47:28.997
I know a few might be

01:47:28.999 --> 01:47:32.534
a little discouraged about
certain prayers, like,

01:47:32.536 --> 01:47:36.339
jobs and whatnot,
but God hears those prayers,

01:47:36.341 --> 01:47:38.741
and they make a difference.

01:47:38.743 --> 01:47:41.209
And I know God's a healer.

01:47:41.211 --> 01:47:42.444
I really know.

01:47:42.446 --> 01:47:45.516
And he healed me,
so I realize that. Yeah.

01:47:47.084 --> 01:47:50.420
And I just hope that, God,
someday,

01:47:50.422 --> 01:47:53.389
I'll make a difference
in this world

01:47:53.391 --> 01:47:56.559
and maybe in somebody as well.

01:47:56.561 --> 01:47:58.293
And I really hope for that,

01:47:58.295 --> 01:48:00.465
and I'll hope to
see that real soon.
