00:02.210 --> 00:06.130
Friends, family,
we're gathered to celebrate here today...

00:06.297 --> 00:09.008
...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.

00:09.926 --> 00:12.511
Now Ross, repeat after me.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.263
I, Ross.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.597
I, Ross.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.558
Take thee, Emily.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.226
Take thee, Rachel.

00:22.897 --> 00:24.398
Emily.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.402
Heh. Emily.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.530
Uh, shall I go on?

00:31.823 --> 00:33.866
He said "Rachel," right?

00:34.034 --> 00:36.243
Do you think I should go up there?

00:36.911 --> 00:38.871
Yes. Yes. Do go on.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.373
I think we'd better start again.

00:41.541 --> 00:44.126
Ross, repeat after me.

00:44.294 --> 00:47.129
I, Ross.

00:47.297 --> 00:54.845
Take thee, Emily.

00:56.264 --> 00:58.891
Ha, ha. Like there'd be anybody else.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.271
As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...

01:04.438 --> 01:06.065
...till death parts us.

01:06.232 --> 01:11.111
As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...

01:11.279 --> 01:13.947
...until death parts us.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.325
Really, I do. Emily.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.577
Do you have the rings?

01:20.163 --> 01:23.248
Emily, place this ring on Ross' finger...

01:23.416 --> 01:26.293
...as a symbol of your bond everlasting.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.259
Ross, place this ring...

01:34.427 --> 01:36.678
...on Emily's hand as a symbol...

01:36.846 --> 01:39.264
...of the love that encircles you forever.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.225
Happy to.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.437
They have made their declarations...

01:45.605 --> 01:50.275
...and it gives me great pleasure
to declare them husband and wife.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.530
You may kiss the bride.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.496
This is worse than when
he married the lesbian.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.627
Just keep smiling.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.002
Okay...

02:12.841 --> 02:15.217
Well, that went well. Yeah.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.887
It could've been worse.
He could've shot her.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.976
Ha, ha. That was pretty funny, wasn't it?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.821
You spoiled everything.
It's like a nightmare.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.074
All my friends and family are out there.
How can I face them?

03:21.242 --> 03:22.701
How could you do this to me?

03:22.869 --> 03:25.037
Hey, no matter what happens
with Ross and Emily...

03:25.205 --> 03:26.705
...we still get cake, right?

03:29.209 --> 03:31.835
That's all right.
No, no. You take your time, sweetie.

03:32.003 --> 03:35.088
I'll be out here. Ha, ha.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.966
She's just fixing her makeup.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.134
I hate you.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.095
And I love you.

03:43.848 --> 03:46.892
Boy, a bad time
to say the wrong name, huh, Ross?

03:49.604 --> 03:51.521
That's true. Thanks, Dad.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.567
People should be dancing, huh?

03:55.735 --> 03:58.570
Hey, this is a party. Come on.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.239
Joey. Dance.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.461
Yes, Waltham Interiors.

04:14.671 --> 04:19.257
Hello, this is Ross Geller's
personal physician, Dr. Phalange.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.135
Who?

04:22.345 --> 04:26.181
Yeah, I discovered that Ross forgot
to take his brain medicine.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.934
Um, now, without it, uh,
in the brain of Ross...

04:29.102 --> 04:32.229
...uh, women's names are interchangeable.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.856
Through no fault of his own.

04:35.692 --> 04:36.942
Oh, my God. Phoebe.

04:38.569 --> 04:41.488
No, not Phoebe. Dr. Phalange.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.699
Oh, no. You have it too.

04:45.660 --> 04:46.952
Hello?

04:51.624 --> 04:54.251
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.130
Wow, I hope you don't take this
the wrong way...

04:58.298 --> 05:02.050
...but I know we had plans
to meet up tonight and...

05:02.218 --> 05:05.804
Ugh. I'm just kind of worried
about what it might do to our friendship.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.223
I know.

05:08.391 --> 05:12.311
- Ugh. How could we have let this happen?
- Seven times.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.274
You know, look. We were away.

05:17.442 --> 05:20.819
- In a foreign, romantic country.
- Right.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.321
I blame London.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.989
Bad London.

05:25.616 --> 05:26.658
So look, um...

05:26.868 --> 05:30.912
...while we're still in London,
I mean, we can keep doing it, right?

05:31.080 --> 05:33.582
Well, I don't see that we have a choice.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.752
But when we're back home,
we don't do it.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.378
Only here.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.341
You know,
I saw a wine cellar downstairs.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.469
- I'll meet you there in two minutes.
- Okay.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.891
- Mon? Mon, I got to ask you something.
- Now?

05:51.059 --> 05:53.560
Ross said my name up there.
I mean, come on.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.437
I can't just pretend that didn't happen.

05:55.938 --> 05:57.314
I don't know.

05:58.024 --> 06:02.361
- Monica, what should I do?
- Just do the right thing.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.946
What?

06:05.114 --> 06:08.241
Tow the line. Thread the needle.
Think outside the box.

06:08.409 --> 06:11.661
Monica, wait, listen. I'm gonna talk to Ross
about what he thinks it meant.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.164
Wait. Rachel, no.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.457
He's married.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.209
Married.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.628
If you don't realize that, I can't help you.

06:20.671 --> 06:22.631
Okay. You're right.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.717
You're right. You can't help me.

06:26.636 --> 06:30.472
Jack, is it all our fault?
Were we bad parents?

06:30.640 --> 06:32.391
Yes.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.769
Oh yeah? Well, who serves steak
when there's no place to sit?

06:35.937 --> 06:37.604
I mean,
how are you supposed to eat this?

06:37.772 --> 06:39.231
Hey, what's up?

06:41.567 --> 06:43.402
Where were you?
We were supposed to meet.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.529
- Forget it. That's off.
- Why?

06:45.696 --> 06:48.824
The next tour of the wine cellar...

06:49.367 --> 06:53.245
...will commence in two minutes.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.623
Joey, what are you doing?

06:56.791 --> 06:59.042
You promised Phoebe
no meat till she has the babies.

06:59.210 --> 07:02.003
Well, I figured we're in another country,
so it doesn't count.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.589
- That's true.
- The man's got a point.

07:07.301 --> 07:08.969
Oh, hi.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.429
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.305
I'm sorry things
aren't working out so well.

07:12.473 --> 07:16.810
Oh, no. Ha, ha. It could be better.
It's gonna be okay, right?

07:16.978 --> 07:20.063
Oh, yeah. Of course. I mean,
she's gonna get over this, you know?

07:20.231 --> 07:21.815
I mean, so you said my name.

07:22.024 --> 07:24.651
You know, you just said it
because you saw me there.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.529
If you'd seen a circus freak,
you would've said:

07:27.697 --> 07:29.656
I take thee Circus Freak.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.660
It didn't mean anything.
It's just a mistake.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.954
It didn't mean anything.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.873
- Right?
- No, no.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.375
Of course it didn't mean anything.

07:40.543 --> 07:44.337
I mean, I can understand why Emily
would think it meant something...

07:44.505 --> 07:46.214
...you know, because it was you.

07:46.382 --> 07:50.177
But it absolutely didn't.
It didn't! It didn't!

07:51.304 --> 07:54.473
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside
for your first dance with Emily.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.309
Oh. Oh, the band's ready.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.061
Well, we got to do what the band says.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.355
I don't care about the stupid band!

08:04.192 --> 08:05.984
You spit on me, man.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.112
I'm sorry.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.115
- Emily is taking kind of a long time, huh?
- Heh.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.451
When I locked myself in the bathroom
at my wedding...

08:14.619 --> 08:17.579
...it was because I was trying
to pop the window out of the frame.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.040
- Right.
- Get the hell out of there. You know?

08:25.463 --> 08:28.507
Emily.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.217
I'm coming in.

08:33.261 --> 08:36.056
Oh, look at that. Same thing.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.269
In the middle of everything...

08:41.437 --> 08:44.606
...if I scream the word "yippee,"
just ignore me.

08:47.443 --> 08:50.695
- Huh! Oh, my God. Rachel.
- Oh, hello, Rachel.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.865
Ross said my name.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.408
Okay? My name.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.494
Ross said my name up there.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.163
That obviously means
that he still loves me.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.291
Okay, don't believe me. I know I'm right.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.710
All right. Do you guys want to go
and get a drink?

09:05.878 --> 09:07.587
Yes, we do.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.840
But we have to change first.

09:11.008 --> 09:12.717
Yes, I want to change.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.763
- Why don't you go get a table?
- We'll be down in five minutes.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.807
- Fifteen minutes.
- Ha, ha.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.271
Hello.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.939
Oh, Pheebs. It's Phoebe.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.399
- Oh, hey, hey.
- Oh, great.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.900
Hi.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.610
So, what happened?

09:30.778 --> 09:32.320
Well, Ross said my name.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.490
Yeah, I know,
but I don't think that means anything.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.450
Okay, Pheebs,
let's look at this objectively.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.494
All right, ninth grade, right?

09:39.662 --> 09:41.162
The obsession starts.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.457
All right? Summer after ninth grade...

09:44.625 --> 09:46.459
...he sees me in a two-piece
for the first time.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.962
His obsession begins to grow, right?

09:49.505 --> 09:51.423
Hey, listen, why don't we go change
in my room?

09:51.632 --> 09:54.634
My clothes are... Oh.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.234
- Wow, you look...
- No time for that.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.902
Okay.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.659
Hey, dude. Let me in.
I got a girl out here.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.495
Well, I've got a girl in here.

10:23.581 --> 10:26.374
No, you don't.
I just saw you go in there with Monica.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.712
Well, we're hanging out in here.

10:31.839 --> 10:35.133
Which one of us is gonna be
having sex in there? Me or you?

10:36.218 --> 10:39.262
Well, I suppose I would have to say you.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.808
- What if we're watching a movie in here?
- Which we are.

10:43.976 --> 10:47.520
And we've already paid for it.
It's My Giant.

10:48.356 --> 10:52.025
My Giant? I love that movie.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.073
You really think this is okay?

10:58.240 --> 11:00.742
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.953
Oh, it's so beautiful.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.455
Oh.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.374
You know, I don't feel right about this.

11:07.541 --> 11:08.875
Oh, Monica...

11:10.461 --> 11:12.253
This is the honeymoon suite.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.881
The room expects sex.

11:16.759 --> 11:20.470
The room would be disappointed
if it didn't get sex.

11:20.638 --> 11:23.723
All the other honeymoon suites
would think it was a loser.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.435
Okay.

11:29.105 --> 11:32.649
- Emily?
- Nope. Not under here.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.862
- You didn't find her?
- No, I've looked everywhere.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.699
Well, you couldn't have,
or else you would've found her.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.576
- I think you should keep looking.
- Yeah. For about, uh, 30 minutes?

11:43.744 --> 11:45.412
Or 45?

11:47.957 --> 11:50.583
Wow, in 45 minutes,
you could find her twice.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.589
No. For all I know,
she's trying to find me...

11:56.757 --> 11:59.259
...but couldn't because
I kept moving around.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.137
No, from now on,
I'm staying in one place.

12:02.304 --> 12:03.972
Right here.

12:07.351 --> 12:09.185
- It's getting late.
- Yeah, We're going to go.

12:09.353 --> 12:10.854
Actually...

12:11.439 --> 12:14.107
...do you guys mind
staying here for a while?

12:14.817 --> 12:17.861
Ugh. You know, we got to get up early
and catch that plane to New York.

12:18.028 --> 12:20.196
Yeah, it's a very large plane.

12:22.783 --> 12:24.409
That's cool.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.330
But we'll stay here with you.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.958
Thanks, guys. Ha, ha.

12:33.419 --> 12:37.630
I really appreciate this, you know,
but you don't need to rub my butt.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.312
We have to leave for New York
in an hour.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.190
I know. I've been looking at those doors.

12:55.357 --> 12:58.276
They look pretty soundproof,
don't you think?

12:58.736 --> 13:01.112
We can't do that. That's insane.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.783
I mean, A, he could wake up.
And B, you know...

13:04.950 --> 13:06.409
...let's go for it.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.500
Emily? Emily.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.379
- Emily!
- Nope.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.258
- Forget about Emily. She's not with us.
- We've come for her things.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.511
Where is she?

13:24.678 --> 13:29.015
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated.
She doesn't want to see you ever again.

13:29.266 --> 13:34.354
We're very sad that it didn't work out
between you and Emily, monkey.

13:35.940 --> 13:39.609
But I think you're absolutely delicious.

13:40.277 --> 13:44.364
Excuse me, I'm standing right here.

13:45.699 --> 13:46.991
Oh, yes.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.285
There you are.

13:51.539 --> 13:55.124
Hey. Hey, you guys. Hurry up. Get some.
There's a whole cart outside.

13:55.584 --> 13:58.545
- Goodbye, Geller.
- Now, hold on. Hold on.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.547
Look, look. Your daughter and I...

14:00.714 --> 14:02.966
...are supposed to leave tonight
for our honeymoon.

14:03.133 --> 14:06.052
Now, you tell her that
I'm gonna be at that airport...

14:06.220 --> 14:08.221
...and I hope that she'll be there too.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.808
Yeah, I said Rachel's name,
but it didn't mean anything.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.687
She's just a friend. That's all.
Now, look, just tell Emily I love her...

14:15.855 --> 14:18.815
...and that I can't imagine spending my life
with anyone else.

14:19.149 --> 14:22.443
Please, promise me that
you'll tell her that.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.572
All right, I'll tell her.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.074
Come on, bugger face.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.159
Call me.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.662
You spend half your life in the bathroom.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.540
Why do you never go out
the bloody window?

14:52.308 --> 14:56.227
Well, maybe it's best
we never got to do it again.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.856
Yeah, it kind of makes
that one night special.

15:03.694 --> 15:07.280
You know, technically,
we still are over international waters.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.909
I'm going to the bathroom.
Maybe I'll see you there in a bit?

15:11.076 --> 15:12.410
Okay.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.336
Hey, can I ask you something?

15:21.503 --> 15:23.671
Uh, no.

15:24.965 --> 15:29.177
Felicity and I, we were watching My Giant.
And I was thinking...

15:29.345 --> 15:32.805
...I'm never gonna be as good an actor
as that giant.

15:32.973 --> 15:36.684
Do you think I'm just wasting my life
with this acting thing?

15:36.852 --> 15:37.852
No.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.355
I mean, the giant's like five years
younger than me.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.273
You know, you think I'll ever get there?

15:44.318 --> 15:45.401
Yes.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.822
- Thanks, man.
- Okay, man.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.867
But what about how much taller
he is than me?

15:53.953 --> 15:57.956
I mean, there's no way
I can make myself taller now.

15:58.123 --> 16:01.000
And who knows what science
will come up with in the future...

16:01.168 --> 16:05.880
...but, Chandler, what if I die
an unsuccessful, regular-size man?

16:07.925 --> 16:10.885
Hey, Monica. Wow, you've been
in the bathroom for, like, a half-hour.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.638
I know.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.640
Had the beef tips, huh?

16:27.528 --> 16:29.362
Hey.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.284
You ate meat!

16:37.329 --> 16:38.371
You had sex!

16:41.083 --> 16:42.709
- No, we didn't.
- I know you didn't.

16:42.876 --> 16:45.169
I was talking about Monica.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.047
Phoebe, I did not have sex.

16:48.215 --> 16:51.134
Oh, this pregnancy
is throwing me all off.

16:51.635 --> 16:54.095
- I'm gonna say hi to the chick and duck.
- Oh, me too.

16:54.596 --> 16:57.306
Why would you need to say hi?
You've been feeding them for four days.

16:57.474 --> 17:00.560
Oh, right. Maybe I'll just go home.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.488
Well, we certainly are alone.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.824
Good thing we have that
"not New York" rule.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.409
Right.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.996
Um, listen, since we're on that subject...

17:20.164 --> 17:23.665
...um, I just wanted to tell you that,
um...

17:23.916 --> 17:26.586
Well, I was going through
a really hard time in London...

17:26.753 --> 17:30.757
...what with my brother getting married
and that guy thinking I was Ross' mother.

17:30.924 --> 17:32.091
Right.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.636
Well, anyway, I just...

17:35.888 --> 17:39.432
That night meant a lot to me.
And I guess I'm trying to say thanks.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.933
Oh.

17:43.687 --> 17:46.105
You know,
that night meant a lot to me too.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.858
And it wasn't because I was
in a bad place or anything.

17:49.026 --> 17:53.029
It just meant a lot to me
because you're really hot.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.036
- Is that okay?
- Ha, ha. That's okay.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.121
And I'm cute too?

18:04.666 --> 18:07.585
- And you're cute too.
- Thank you.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.797
- All right, I got to go unpack.
- Okay.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.384
Bye.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.650
I'm still on London time.
Does that count?

18:32.236 --> 18:34.403
- Oh, that counts.
- Oh, good.

18:42.579 --> 18:43.955
Rach.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.040
- Rach.
- Hi.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.792
What are you doing here?

18:47.960 --> 18:51.379
Well, I've been on standby
for a flight home for hours.

18:51.547 --> 18:54.423
- Oh.
- Oh. So no sign of Emily, huh?

18:54.967 --> 18:56.384
Not yet.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.555
So, um...

19:01.682 --> 19:03.307
What time are you supposed to leave?

19:03.475 --> 19:07.395
This is the last call
for Flight 1066 to Athens.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.063
The last call.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.274
Pretty soon, I guess.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.319
I'm sorry.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.574
I just... I don't understand.
I mean, how could she do this?

19:19.741 --> 19:22.201
What, am I like a complete idiot...

19:22.369 --> 19:24.412
...for thinking she'd actually show up?

19:24.580 --> 19:25.872
No.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.207
You're not an idiot, Ross.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.209
You're a guy very much in love.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.587
Same difference.

19:32.754 --> 19:37.884
All passengers for Flight 1066
to Athens should now be on board.

19:38.051 --> 19:39.927
I get it!

19:44.057 --> 19:45.850
Well, that's that.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.144
No, you know what?

19:48.312 --> 19:49.645
I think you should go.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.940
- What?
- Yeah, I do think you should go...

19:53.108 --> 19:55.776
...by yourself. Get some distance.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.487
Clear your head.
I think it would be really good.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.448
Oh, I don't know.

20:00.616 --> 20:03.409
Oh, come on, Ross.
I think it would be really good for you.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.622
I could. I could do that.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.165
Yeah.

20:09.499 --> 20:12.084
I can't even believe her.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.253
You know what? I am going to go.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.504
- Good.
- Why not?

20:15.672 --> 20:17.381
- Right?
- Right. Right.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.134
- Thanks.
- Okay, I'll see you back at home.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.386
If I ever get a flight out of here.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.971
Hey, well...

20:24.640 --> 20:27.600
- No.
- What? Wait, what?

20:29.311 --> 20:30.770
Why don't you come?

20:30.938 --> 20:33.898
I mean, I have two tickets. Why not?

20:35.192 --> 20:39.445
Well, I don't know, Ross. Really?

20:39.863 --> 20:42.615
Yeah, yeah. It'd be great.
I mean, you can...

20:42.783 --> 20:44.158
You can lay on the beach...

20:44.326 --> 20:47.912
...and I can cry over my failed marriage.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.706
- You see how I make jokes?
- Uh-huh.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.625
Really. I mean...

20:53.502 --> 20:55.044
God, I could use a friend.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.881
Oh, wow. Okay, maybe.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.424
Um...

21:01.385 --> 21:02.635
Yes, I can do that.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.513
- Cool.
- All right, cool.

21:07.474 --> 21:09.600
Okay, we're going to Greece. Yeah, okay.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.769
Aah, aah. I forgot my jacket.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.230
- Well, you tell them to wait.
- Okay.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.482
- Wait. Wait.
- Okay.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.155
Emily.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.161
Oh, no, no, no.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.915
No! No!

21:33.083 --> 21:34.709
Emily!

21:37.879 --> 21:40.506
Ah, yes. I will have a glass
of the Merlot...

21:40.674 --> 21:43.384
...and he will have a white-wine spritzer.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.639
Whoo!

21:48.807 --> 21:50.016
Huh.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.351
Hey, look at that. The airport's moving.

21:53.812 --> 21:54.979
Hey, are we moving?

21:55.147 --> 21:57.315
Are we moving? Why are we moving?

21:57.482 --> 21:58.566
They... Um...

21:58.734 --> 22:01.861
Yeah, does the captain know
that we're moving?

22:03.530 --> 22:04.530
Oh, my gosh.
