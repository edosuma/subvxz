00:10.344 --> 00:13.812
This land is bad.

00:13.914 --> 00:16.782
I felt, like, a punch,
like something hit me.

00:16.884 --> 00:19.268
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.987
Something is chanting to
me, giving me thoughts.

00:22.089 --> 00:24.123
I think she thinks
she's losing her mind.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.291
I think she kind of is.

00:26.393 --> 00:28.271
I'm surprised you didn't
run the hell out of here.

00:28.371 --> 00:29.387
Where do you go?

00:29.489 --> 00:32.256
I'm hearing, "I'm gonna
eat her for dinner.

00:32.359 --> 00:36.497
I'm gonna eat her. I'm gonna eat her."

00:36.597 --> 00:39.498
There's a dark presence.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.335
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.435 --> 00:43.335
These things, they're freaking out.

00:43.437 --> 00:44.736
They're from hell.

00:44.839 --> 00:45.838
I see dead people.

00:45.940 --> 00:47.105
They were being hunted.

00:47.208 --> 00:48.874
I speak to dead people.

00:48.976 --> 00:50.776
They were setting people on fire,

00:50.878 --> 00:51.910
burning them alive.

00:52.012 --> 00:53.412
And they speak to me.

00:53.514 --> 00:54.713
Her neck got broken.

00:54.815 --> 00:57.683
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:57.785 --> 00:59.685
I hear a gunshot.

00:59.787 --> 01:01.253
I rely on my partner.

01:01.355 --> 01:02.888
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:02.990 --> 01:04.723
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:04.825 --> 01:05.924
Something's not right here.

01:06.026 --> 01:08.794
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:08.896 --> 01:09.962
It's not safe here.

01:10.064 --> 01:11.063
It's my job to reveal them.

01:11.148 --> 01:12.631
Are any of them buried on the property?

01:12.733 --> 01:13.765
They're all buried here.

01:13.868 --> 01:16.235
But Steve and I never speak...

01:16.320 --> 01:18.270
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.372 --> 01:19.671
Until the very end...

01:19.773 --> 01:20.973
I can't do it no more.

01:21.058 --> 01:23.008
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:23.110 --> 01:24.877
Holy [bleep] look at this.

01:24.979 --> 01:26.311
Or time to get out.

01:26.447 --> 01:27.813
It does not have a happy ending.

01:27.915 --> 01:30.115
Something kills people here.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

01:43.829 --> 01:45.595
I'm in Mayfield, Kentucky.

01:45.680 --> 01:48.631
It's a small city in the
southwestern part of the state.

01:48.767 --> 01:51.034
I got a call from a
mother who was hysterical.

01:51.169 --> 01:53.303
She thinks that whatever's in the house

01:53.438 --> 01:54.888
is going after her two kids,

01:55.006 --> 01:58.007
destroying her own health,
and ripping her family apart.

01:58.109 --> 01:59.642
She told me she's tried everything

01:59.728 --> 02:01.010
and that we're her last hope.

02:03.649 --> 02:05.115
Before Amy arrives,

02:05.217 --> 02:07.951
I clear the house of
any leading information,

02:08.053 --> 02:11.121
removing family photos
and religious icons.

02:11.206 --> 02:12.589
When I'm finished,

02:12.691 --> 02:15.192
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:26.405 --> 02:29.689
First thing that I saw was a hill.

02:29.808 --> 02:31.508
There's a hill.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.443
It starts to roll.

02:33.545 --> 02:36.680
There are things inside it.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.249
There's a lot of them.

02:39.351 --> 02:43.820
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

02:45.791 --> 02:50.727
The dead in here are, uh, scared.

02:53.365 --> 03:00.136
They know this land, and
they know that it is bad.

03:08.163 --> 03:09.879
Well, Socorro, when
I talked to you on the phone,

03:09.965 --> 03:10.947
you sounded really upset.

03:11.049 --> 03:13.216
I am.

03:13.302 --> 03:16.419
It's not safe here.
I'm afraid for my kids.

03:16.555 --> 03:18.138
It's been very difficult.

03:18.257 --> 03:20.206
Nobody should have to live like this.

03:20.292 --> 03:21.591
No.

03:21.677 --> 03:23.460
Honestly, I mean, you're our last hope.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.730
Who exactly lives in the house, though?

03:26.865 --> 03:28.315
Well, I have a photo here.

03:31.136 --> 03:32.875
This is my husband, Tim.

03:32.975 --> 03:36.312
This is our oldest daughter, Bianca.

03:36.412 --> 03:37.349
She's 14.

03:37.449 --> 03:39.572
And then, this is McKenzie,
our youngest. She's 8.

03:39.672 --> 03:41.171
What year did you move in?

03:41.273 --> 03:42.773
2006.

03:42.875 --> 03:44.841
Now, if you can, just give me a list

03:44.927 --> 03:46.727
of what's going on in the house.

03:46.845 --> 03:48.078
There's been knocking.

03:48.180 --> 03:50.914
There's been footsteps,

03:51.016 --> 03:54.451
things moving on their
own, shadow figures.

03:54.553 --> 03:55.552
Okay.

03:55.637 --> 03:57.521
And now it seems to be getting violent.

03:57.606 --> 03:59.589
I feel it's picking on the
girls and picking on myself.

03:59.725 --> 04:02.275
McKenzie hasn't slept in her room

04:02.361 --> 04:03.610
in the last 4 or 5 years.

04:03.696 --> 04:05.912
She's been sleeping
with my husband and I.

04:05.998 --> 04:07.714
No 8-year-old's supposed
to go through that.

04:07.833 --> 04:09.099
Well, that can't be
great for the marriage.

04:09.184 --> 04:11.168
It's taken a very big
toll on our marriage.

04:11.270 --> 04:15.005
But at the same time, she's scared.

04:15.107 --> 04:16.940
We're the parents. We're
supposed to protect them.

04:17.076 --> 04:18.507
What about you? How are you holding up?

04:18.594 --> 04:19.910
It's been very hard.

04:19.995 --> 04:23.413
There's days where I just
think I'm going crazy.

04:23.549 --> 04:27.617
I've also had medical
issues with my right leg.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.587
I've been to the doctor's.
I've been to a specialist.

04:30.672 --> 04:32.956
And nobody can seem to tell
me what's wrong with my leg.

04:33.042 --> 04:34.958
Is that the only physical
problem you're having?

04:35.060 --> 04:36.226
Other than my anxiety.

04:36.328 --> 04:38.895
So when these anxiety
attacks happen, is it...

04:38.997 --> 04:40.430
Explain what happens to you.

04:40.499 --> 04:42.232
Almost like I can't
breathe and my chest hurts.

04:42.334 --> 04:44.601
Something doesn't feel right,

04:44.703 --> 04:46.903
almost like I'm crawling
out of my own skin.

04:47.005 --> 04:49.256
It's just not normal.
I know it's not normal.

04:49.375 --> 04:50.757
Well, we're here.

04:50.843 --> 04:54.277
I just
hope you guys can help.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.554
This is a bad room,

05:04.656 --> 05:06.089
very bad.

05:06.191 --> 05:08.258
Yeah. I see a man and a woman fighting.

05:08.394 --> 05:09.693
She has, like, stomach...

05:09.795 --> 05:12.963
bad stomach problems, heart issues.

05:13.065 --> 05:15.499
Real sick. Really, really [bleep] sick.

05:15.601 --> 05:19.169
Panic, anxiety, very depressed.

05:19.271 --> 05:20.437
Ooh.

05:29.014 --> 05:31.715
Oh, this is terrible. This is awful.

05:31.817 --> 05:36.136
My God. This person has,
like, major anxiety issues.

05:36.255 --> 05:38.388
There's this, like, overwhelming feeling

05:38.474 --> 05:40.023
like she can't take it anymore.

05:43.378 --> 05:45.195
Uh...

05:45.330 --> 05:47.631
I think she thinks
she's losing her mind.

05:47.733 --> 05:49.433
I think she kind of is.

05:49.535 --> 05:51.501
Ooh.

05:52.955 --> 05:54.971
Oh, my God.

05:55.073 --> 05:57.541
Oh.

06:01.246 --> 06:03.246
Okay. So why'd you
bring me in the kitchen?

06:03.348 --> 06:06.516
In here, we hear a lot
of unexplained noise

06:06.652 --> 06:08.535
that's coming out of
the kitchen area...

06:08.654 --> 06:11.488
doors slamming, things
shuffling in the cabinets.

06:11.573 --> 06:14.724
Now, do you actually see the
drawers opening and closing?

06:14.810 --> 06:16.526
No. We don't.

06:16.612 --> 06:18.962
Do you ever have evidence
that something's been moved?

06:19.097 --> 06:20.297
No. We don't.

06:20.432 --> 06:21.681
Anything else?

06:21.800 --> 06:22.866
In the laundry room area,

06:22.968 --> 06:25.769
I felt, like, a punch,
like something just hit me.

06:25.854 --> 06:27.537
It was whew, right at the rib cage.

06:27.639 --> 06:30.273
It knocked the wind out of me. Really?

06:30.375 --> 06:32.442
And I've seen a shadow
figure at the door.

06:32.544 --> 06:36.146
It's tall, dark, black male figure.

06:36.231 --> 06:38.081
And it's there for a couple
seconds, and it's gone.

06:38.167 --> 06:40.367
You got a lot of lights from cars

06:40.486 --> 06:42.569
going by every once in a while.

06:42.654 --> 06:43.920
What about that?

06:44.022 --> 06:45.872
Could it cast a shadow on
anything you got in there?

06:45.958 --> 06:48.258
No. I don't believe it does. No.

06:48.343 --> 06:49.559
So this shadow figure you saw,

06:49.661 --> 06:51.461
do you feel that this
thing is threatening?

06:51.563 --> 06:53.129
Yes. I was scared.

06:53.232 --> 06:54.798
Being stared at...

06:54.900 --> 06:58.468
It's a stare that makes you
very, very uncomfortable.

06:58.570 --> 07:00.504
I'm surprised you didn't
run the hell out of here.

07:00.589 --> 07:02.305
Where do you go?

07:05.744 --> 07:07.777
The living woman,

07:07.913 --> 07:11.114
she sees the figures from outside,

07:11.200 --> 07:14.150
from inside the earth.

07:14.253 --> 07:17.237
Do you know what these things
would look like to people?

07:17.356 --> 07:19.139
Like shadow people.

07:19.258 --> 07:22.158
They're kind of tall, though.

07:22.261 --> 07:25.462
They're around her a lot.

07:25.547 --> 07:29.266
She's attracting them to her

07:29.368 --> 07:35.772
because of what is happening
or has happened in her life.

07:35.857 --> 07:41.411
Somehow, she knows that
there are these bad things,

07:41.513 --> 07:44.648
so she's, like, inviting this evil in.

07:52.608 --> 07:55.175
How long has McKenzie been
sleeping with you guys?

07:55.294 --> 07:56.726
A little over 4 years.

07:57.729 --> 07:58.862
It's a lot to deal with.

07:58.947 --> 08:02.732
And it has taken a
strain on our marriage.

08:02.818 --> 08:04.200
Okay.

08:04.303 --> 08:05.869
You mentioned that you had
some stuff going on in here.

08:05.971 --> 08:08.355
Yes. Um, I was lying in bed.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.339
Okay.

08:09.441 --> 08:12.442
And I saw a dark shadow figure

08:12.511 --> 08:14.511
standing over my bed.

08:14.596 --> 08:16.646
I closed my eyes
several times and prayed.

08:16.732 --> 08:18.198
And opened my eyes,
and it's still there.

08:18.317 --> 08:20.383
You... you're sure you
weren't dreaming, though?

08:20.452 --> 08:21.534
No. I wasn't dreaming.

08:21.620 --> 08:23.587
Did that ever happen again?

08:23.672 --> 08:25.055
In the bathroom.

08:25.157 --> 08:27.307
As I'm in there taking a shower,

08:27.426 --> 08:29.626
I feel like I'm being stared at.

08:29.728 --> 08:30.894
It's... it's horrible.

08:30.996 --> 08:33.313
There's been another
incident just recently

08:33.398 --> 08:35.030
that I'm laying in bed,

08:35.133 --> 08:37.366
and I felt a tug on the blankets.

08:37.469 --> 08:39.535
And McKenzie usually
tugs at the blankets

08:39.638 --> 08:41.104
and then crawls into bed with us.

08:41.206 --> 08:44.174
So I turned, thinking,
"Well, okay, McKenzie."

08:44.259 --> 08:46.743
Well, McKenzie's not in bed with me.

08:46.845 --> 08:48.745
What about the dogs? Do they ever...

08:48.847 --> 08:50.347
No. They get kenneled at night.

08:50.449 --> 08:51.731
I mean, how are you living like this?

08:51.817 --> 08:53.350
I mean, just listening
to your stories is...

08:53.452 --> 08:55.285
It's been very hard. It's
been very difficult, Steve.

08:55.387 --> 08:58.421
I don't know what's here.

08:58.507 --> 09:02.225
I know that whatever is
here, it's not a good thing.

09:06.264 --> 09:08.798
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

09:11.603 --> 09:13.670
They're all over.

09:13.755 --> 09:15.338
They're all over in here.

09:17.809 --> 09:20.443
She sees like two to four of them.

09:20.529 --> 09:23.079
I think she thinks
she's losing her mind.

09:24.549 --> 09:28.084
Subconsciously, she invited them in.

09:28.186 --> 09:31.771
They're attracted to negative people.

09:31.857 --> 09:35.525
So if the person is
having a really bad time

09:35.661 --> 09:39.929
or they're depressed, they
see that as an invitation.

09:40.032 --> 09:41.231
You know, it's almost kind of like

09:41.333 --> 09:43.733
she's trying to sell her soul...

09:43.835 --> 09:46.603
like she's trying to make a deal here.

09:46.705 --> 09:47.937
For what?

09:48.023 --> 09:52.375
She's saying she would
give up her eternal soul.

09:52.461 --> 09:55.679
She doesn't really see another way out.

10:13.770 --> 10:16.404
So, Tim, I talked to your
wife about what's going on here,

10:16.506 --> 10:17.538
and things are pretty bad.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.140
Yeah. And it's getting worse.

10:19.242 --> 10:20.972
You got to be concerned
for your wife and daughters,

10:21.072 --> 10:21.393
I would think.

10:21.428 --> 10:23.943
Yeah. I am because my work
takes me out of town a lot.

10:24.043 --> 10:26.212
And it's tough. It's tough leaving.

10:26.312 --> 10:28.612
So, Tim, how is the
relationship with your wife?

10:28.714 --> 10:31.949
It's not like it should be.

10:32.051 --> 10:35.086
I mean, we both snap at each other.

10:35.188 --> 10:38.689
The slightest little thing
just sets... sets us off.

10:38.791 --> 10:41.325
So what about experiences for yourself?

10:41.410 --> 10:42.526
Have you had any?

10:42.628 --> 10:45.546
I went up and was tucking the girls in.

10:45.631 --> 10:46.680
Okay.

10:46.799 --> 10:48.132
And just getting ready
to come down the stairs.

10:48.234 --> 10:51.135
And next thing I know, my
feet are out from under me,

10:51.237 --> 10:53.304
and I'm at the bottom of the stairs.

10:53.406 --> 10:55.806
Did one foot slip? What
happened when you fell?

10:55.908 --> 10:56.874
I don't fall.

10:56.959 --> 10:58.425
I've never fell down stairs before.

10:58.511 --> 11:00.377
You know, I'm...
I'm an iron worker.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.413
Right. So for your
profession alone, you would...

11:02.498 --> 11:04.215
you're not the type
that's just gonna fall.

11:04.317 --> 11:05.549
Right.

11:05.685 --> 11:07.184
Could've broke your neck. Yeah.

11:08.521 --> 11:13.674
There's an old man down
here talking about a barn.

11:13.793 --> 11:16.277
He lived here a long time ago,

11:16.362 --> 11:17.695
a long, long time ago.

11:17.797 --> 11:20.498
He walks through the kitchen wall.

11:22.001 --> 11:23.334
He does pranks...

11:23.469 --> 11:26.237
I think like making
people trip and fall.

11:26.339 --> 11:28.873
I did see somebody tripping,
and he was laughing.

11:32.512 --> 11:34.445
This guy, he's not good.

11:34.547 --> 11:37.481
Uh, he's very, very abusive.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.617
He doesn't give a [bleep]
what I think about him.

11:45.158 --> 11:48.359
So, Bianca, I was
talking to Mom and Dad.

11:48.461 --> 11:49.760
They're telling me

11:49.862 --> 11:51.295
you're going through
some tough times here.

11:51.430 --> 11:53.130
It's kind of hard, you know?

11:53.216 --> 11:55.983
Like, you don't know
if you're sane or not.

11:56.068 --> 11:58.969
You feel crazy. Feels
like you're in a dream.

11:59.071 --> 12:00.337
I was talking to Mom,

12:00.473 --> 12:02.823
and she was telling me
that her mood's changed.

12:02.942 --> 12:03.941
Have you noticed that?

12:04.076 --> 12:04.942
Yeah.

12:05.077 --> 12:08.579
She's mad a lot, short-tempered.

12:08.681 --> 12:12.216
It's... it happens to me.
I'll get extremely mad.

12:12.351 --> 12:13.851
I think it's the thing that's here.

12:13.953 --> 12:16.353
We used to be happy.

12:16.455 --> 12:20.090
What are some of the
experiences you're having?

12:20.193 --> 12:21.825
In the corners or on the wall,

12:21.928 --> 12:25.196
it's this really dark, tall man figure.

12:25.281 --> 12:27.381
But you can't see anything,
no face, no nothing,

12:27.466 --> 12:28.415
just a black mist.

12:28.501 --> 12:31.035
And how often do you see this, honey?

12:31.120 --> 12:32.303
Every other week.

12:32.388 --> 12:34.421
Is anything else going on with you?

12:34.507 --> 12:35.973
I've had thoughts that aren't mine.

12:36.108 --> 12:38.192
Something is chanting to
me, giving me thoughts like,

12:38.311 --> 12:39.910
"I wasn't meant to be here."

12:40.012 --> 12:40.911
Okay.

12:41.013 --> 12:42.313
"I don't belong."

12:43.482 --> 12:46.150
If you already know
it's not your thoughts,

12:46.252 --> 12:47.685
you got this beat.

12:47.787 --> 12:49.653
You know that, right?

12:49.739 --> 12:50.621
Mm-hmm.

12:50.756 --> 12:52.089
Now, is anything else happening?

12:52.174 --> 12:55.209
I hear voices, growls.

12:55.328 --> 12:56.393
Growls?

12:56.495 --> 12:59.780
What kind of growls
are we talking about?

12:59.899 --> 13:03.234
It was like a roar
but a really deep roar

13:03.319 --> 13:06.704
and an animal and, like,
human mixed together.

13:06.789 --> 13:08.639
It's... it
was scary.

13:08.724 --> 13:10.808
How do you stay up here?

13:10.943 --> 13:12.776
Lights. I always sleep with lights on.

13:12.862 --> 13:14.561
Some nights, I don't sleep at all.

13:14.680 --> 13:17.281
Now, do you want to stay
here, or do you want to move?

13:17.366 --> 13:18.649
- I want to move.
- You do?

13:18.734 --> 13:21.619
I do. I don't feel safe here.

13:21.754 --> 13:23.554
Okay.

13:23.656 --> 13:27.057
Ooh. There is a teenage boy.

13:27.143 --> 13:29.059
It's crazy and out of control.

13:29.161 --> 13:31.996
And I think he causes a lot of problems.

13:32.098 --> 13:33.464
He's in here a lot.

13:33.566 --> 13:35.399
He causes noise.

13:35.501 --> 13:37.868
He's very noisy, very loud.

13:37.970 --> 13:39.870
He does, like, growling.

13:41.774 --> 13:45.342
I see an old woman.

13:45.444 --> 13:49.280
And she's done... She's,
like, done good things

13:49.382 --> 13:52.383
to, like, fake this living lady out

13:52.485 --> 13:53.867
to trust her or something

13:53.953 --> 13:58.756
but made her feel like
she's protecting her.

14:00.977 --> 14:04.261
I think these kids are seeing [bleep]

14:04.363 --> 14:06.263
She freaks them out.

14:06.365 --> 14:08.549
Like, she, like, does creepy [bleep]

14:08.668 --> 14:10.401
Maybe looks like a mist, maybe?

14:10.503 --> 14:12.870
She goes to the bed a lot.

14:12.955 --> 14:14.088
I think she's flo...

14:14.206 --> 14:19.376
She's been seen over...
hovering over people.

14:19.462 --> 14:21.679
That's [bleep] creepy.

14:29.322 --> 14:31.855
So, McKenzie,
I was talking to Mom.

14:31.957 --> 14:33.173
I was talking to Dad.

14:33.259 --> 14:34.491
And they were saying

14:34.627 --> 14:36.260
you were having some
tough things going on here

14:36.362 --> 14:37.778
that you were...
things that scared you.

14:37.897 --> 14:38.946
Mm-hmm.

14:39.065 --> 14:40.264
And this is your room, right?

14:40.366 --> 14:41.498
Yeah.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.701
It's beautiful. I wish
I had a room like this.

14:43.803 --> 14:45.703
But you don't sleep up here.

14:45.838 --> 14:47.037
Never.

14:47.123 --> 14:48.322
You're scared to be up here?

14:48.441 --> 14:51.141
You are. Okay.

14:51.243 --> 14:54.061
Are there things that happened
that you can tell me about

14:54.146 --> 14:55.112
that scared you?

14:55.197 --> 14:57.281
Well, one day, whenever I was sleeping

14:57.416 --> 15:01.168
in my mom and dad's room,
I saw a black shadow.

15:01.287 --> 15:03.287
And it was coming across the yard.

15:03.389 --> 15:04.455
And that scared you?

15:04.540 --> 15:06.857
You play up here?

15:06.942 --> 15:07.941
Sometimes.

15:08.027 --> 15:10.160
Okay. Are you alone when you do that?

15:10.262 --> 15:12.046
No. Okay.

15:12.164 --> 15:14.048
How come? Tell me.

15:14.133 --> 15:18.102
Because I always feel like
someone's, like, watching me.

15:18.187 --> 15:20.337
You do?

15:20.439 --> 15:21.739
Okay.

15:21.841 --> 15:26.477
The dead lady, she wants this one bad.

15:26.579 --> 15:28.679
She wants this one very bad.

15:28.781 --> 15:30.280
She didn't want me to come in here.

15:30.416 --> 15:32.349
She just says weird [bleep]
like, "I'm gonna eat her,"

15:32.451 --> 15:34.685
you know, "I'm gonna
eat her for dinner."

15:34.787 --> 15:37.388
She, like, watches constantly this one.

15:37.490 --> 15:39.256
Watches, watches, watches.

15:41.794 --> 15:45.829
Follows everywhere, everywhere, watches.

15:45.931 --> 15:48.315
Bad, bad.

15:48.434 --> 15:52.403
I think she's influencing this person

15:52.505 --> 15:54.738
or will influence this person.

15:54.874 --> 16:00.461
Whoever sleeps in here
the most is in trouble.

16:00.546 --> 16:02.679
Very haunted person.

16:02.765 --> 16:03.947
Very haunted.

16:04.049 --> 16:06.450
Not even a [bleep] chance, man.

16:06.552 --> 16:08.752
Not even a fighting chance.

16:22.427 --> 16:23.777
Socorro and Tim

16:23.896 --> 16:25.312
don't know a lot about
their property's history.

16:25.836 --> 16:28.404
So I got on the phone and
called a bunch of locals.

16:28.506 --> 16:30.940
A historian just got
back to me and told me

16:31.042 --> 16:34.009
that one of the earliest
owners of my client's property

16:34.145 --> 16:36.228
has a story I'm definitely
gonna want to hear about.

16:42.987 --> 16:44.420
You mentioned on the phone

16:44.522 --> 16:46.396
that previous owners
of my client's property

16:46.496 --> 16:48.763
had a pretty tragic time there.

16:48.849 --> 16:50.632
Who are these people?

16:50.667 --> 16:53.018
Well, George and Agnes Wyatt
are the owners of the property.

16:53.136 --> 16:57.072
They bought it in
1919 to farm tobacco on

16:57.157 --> 16:59.571
with their only child, Virgil.

17:00.505 --> 17:03.423
George and Agnes came from
very good farm families.

17:03.558 --> 17:05.825
Here's a picture of
George in his mid-30s.

17:05.961 --> 17:08.294
As you can see, he's a good, strong guy.

17:08.380 --> 17:11.114
And Agnes came from a
very prominent family.

17:11.199 --> 17:13.132
She was one of six children.

17:13.218 --> 17:15.367
Her father was
very well-to-do

17:15.470 --> 17:17.156
and was even elected city assessor.

17:17.256 --> 17:18.421
Okay. So how did it go for them?

17:18.507 --> 17:20.089
You mentioned the tragedy.
What's their story?

17:20.159 --> 17:24.394
Well, in 1937, George
got very, very ill.

17:24.496 --> 17:28.632
He was experiencing intense
pain in his upper-right abdomen,

17:28.767 --> 17:31.935
nausea, vomiting, fever,

17:32.037 --> 17:33.386
even jaundice,

17:33.472 --> 17:35.639
the yellowing of the skin and the eyes.

17:35.741 --> 17:37.874
They took him to the Mayfield hospital,

17:37.960 --> 17:40.777
and he was diagnosed with
a gallbladder inflammation.

17:40.879 --> 17:45.815
Two days after his surgery,
he died in his hospital bed.

17:45.918 --> 17:49.786
It was not a painless way to go at all.

17:49.872 --> 17:52.822
Okay. So as far as Agnes
goes, does she remarry?

17:52.908 --> 17:53.990
What's the story?

17:54.092 --> 17:55.141
She did not remarry.

17:55.227 --> 17:58.628
She remained on the farm
by herself until she died.

17:58.730 --> 18:01.932
Okay. So how soon after
George dies does she die?

18:02.034 --> 18:02.983
Five years.

18:03.101 --> 18:04.050
Five years?

18:04.169 --> 18:07.354
She died in her own
bed on October 20, 1942.

18:07.439 --> 18:09.839
She dies of the same
thing as her husband?

18:09.925 --> 18:12.108
Same symptoms. Same diagnosis.

18:16.014 --> 18:19.232
Okay.

18:19.318 --> 18:21.051
The old woman,

18:21.153 --> 18:24.137
she doesn't want me to
know anything about her.

18:28.243 --> 18:31.428
Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.

18:31.530 --> 18:35.899
This was prop... her
family's property.

18:36.001 --> 18:40.337
Who is this [bleep] person?

18:43.742 --> 18:46.076
A lot of money there.
A lot of money there.

18:46.178 --> 18:49.379
She had siblings, lots of siblings,

18:49.481 --> 18:51.248
something like five or six.

18:55.220 --> 18:56.876
Okay. So I got to assume
Virgil's the only kid.

18:56.976 --> 18:57.842
He gets the farm.

18:57.977 --> 19:00.144
No. She cuts him out of the will.

19:00.246 --> 19:03.998
When Agnes passed away in 1942,
and here's a copy of the will,

19:04.083 --> 19:08.018
it says in the will that
Virgil doesn't get anything.

19:08.104 --> 19:09.720
Why would she do that?

19:09.856 --> 19:11.555
It would appear as though
she didn't trust him.

19:11.691 --> 19:12.873
It sounds like she's a mean woman.

19:12.992 --> 19:14.542
Yes. It does certainly seem as though

19:14.660 --> 19:16.160
she could be a very spiteful person.

19:16.245 --> 19:17.762
So why didn't she trust him?

19:17.847 --> 19:19.764
He moved off the farm and
trained to become a machinist,

19:19.866 --> 19:21.766
which is a very skilled profession.

19:21.901 --> 19:22.900
Okay.

19:22.985 --> 19:25.369
But he didn't hold
that job for very long.

19:25.471 --> 19:27.538
And he ended up becoming a laborer

19:27.640 --> 19:30.024
for the Kentucky Department of Highways,

19:30.109 --> 19:33.495
which is a very big drop in income.

19:33.595 --> 19:34.878
What do you think happened?

19:34.996 --> 19:36.796
Well, that's the interesting thing.

19:36.882 --> 19:37.931
There are indications

19:38.033 --> 19:40.166
that he may have had
trouble with alcohol.

19:40.268 --> 19:43.570
He ended up dying at the age of 62

19:43.672 --> 19:45.905
from complications...

19:46.007 --> 19:48.741
an enlarged liver and kidney failure,

19:48.877 --> 19:51.444
which is indicative of alcoholism.

19:51.546 --> 19:53.179
Okay.

19:53.265 --> 19:59.352
The old lady doesn't
like the teenage boy.

20:00.822 --> 20:02.555
She says he gets in the way.

20:02.657 --> 20:07.360
She can't abide it.

20:07.462 --> 20:08.861
She's mad.

20:08.964 --> 20:12.515
Some kind of weird dynamic here.

20:12.634 --> 20:15.018
Totally just [bleep]

20:16.338 --> 20:18.271
The old man is laughing.

20:18.373 --> 20:21.341
He's like, "Oh, you met the... upstairs."

20:21.443 --> 20:23.743
He hates her, hates her.

20:23.845 --> 20:26.246
Are you guys related
somehow? I don't know.

20:26.348 --> 20:27.880
They knew her father.

20:27.966 --> 20:30.049
He's saying, like, somebody
should've just, like,

20:30.151 --> 20:32.252
[bleep] like, shot them
all, like, killed them all

20:32.354 --> 20:34.487
because they were all, like, demented.

20:41.129 --> 20:42.562
If you need us to investigate

20:42.664 --> 20:44.280
unexplained activity in your home,

20:44.399 --> 20:47.033
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

20:47.135 --> 20:48.968
Click on "Help Me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

20:49.104 --> 20:50.136
and we'll help if we can.

20:59.849 --> 21:02.087
So far, I've got
a family living in fear

21:02.187 --> 21:04.804
on a property that's
seen at least two deaths.

21:06.074 --> 21:07.173
But I need to see

21:07.258 --> 21:10.209
if there's anything else
that can help my case.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.168
Searching through old records,

21:12.268 --> 21:14.234
I find not one but
four men who were killed

21:14.336 --> 21:18.505
while working on my client's property...

21:18.607 --> 21:20.641
all by a single bolt of lightning.

21:23.195 --> 21:25.261
I'm heading over to meet
with a local archivist

21:25.347 --> 21:27.130
who said those men never had a chance.

21:33.639 --> 21:35.555
Well, Nathan, thanks for
helping me out with my case,

21:35.641 --> 21:37.274
but why out here in
the middle of nowhere?

21:37.359 --> 21:39.843
Well, I wanted to bring you out
here to a working tobacco farm

21:39.945 --> 21:41.061
to kind of give you a glimpse

21:41.180 --> 21:43.080
of what your client's property
looked like at the time.

21:43.215 --> 21:45.549
All right. So what's the
story with this accident?

21:45.634 --> 21:47.634
On September 2, 1939,

21:47.720 --> 21:50.187
seven farmers had been
out cutting tobacco.

21:50.272 --> 21:52.956
And they were taking
it to a barn to hang it

21:53.058 --> 21:55.425
when, all of a sudden,
a huge storm blew up.

21:55.527 --> 21:58.695
It was one of the worst storms
that hit the area in the time.

21:58.781 --> 22:00.597
And you can see here

22:00.683 --> 22:03.650
massive flooding, power lines down.

22:03.769 --> 22:06.386
A number of roofs were
blown off of buildings.

22:06.505 --> 22:09.172
Pretty rough storm.

22:09.258 --> 22:11.191
The lightning strikes
all seven of the men.

22:11.310 --> 22:12.576
They all go down.

22:12.711 --> 22:14.044
That's incredible.

22:14.129 --> 22:16.847
Unfortunately, four of the men die.

22:16.949 --> 22:19.349
Wow.

22:19.485 --> 22:22.219
Did these guys even know it was coming?

22:22.321 --> 22:23.704
I doubt that they had
any idea it was coming.

22:23.789 --> 22:24.955
Okay.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.757
Here's their death certificates here.

22:29.728 --> 22:32.245
You had three women who
became widows that day

22:32.331 --> 22:34.631
and two children who lost their fathers.

22:34.700 --> 22:35.866
Geez. Horrible event.

22:35.951 --> 22:37.834
So this is just bad luck.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.202
Bad luck or something.

22:39.304 --> 22:41.471
I don't know of anyone
that's been hit by lightning

22:41.573 --> 22:42.589
here in Western Kentucky.

22:42.708 --> 22:43.690
I lived here all my life.

22:52.618 --> 22:55.619
These shadow people,

22:55.721 --> 22:58.038
they're all over the place

22:58.123 --> 23:00.924
but mostly stay in the ground.

23:01.026 --> 23:03.960
It's almost like a burial.

23:11.303 --> 23:15.138
There's something with the...
with the outside, with the land.

23:15.240 --> 23:20.877
There's something wrong
here with the earth,

23:20.979 --> 23:24.881
some kind of, like,
entities or something.

23:24.983 --> 23:28.885
Like, I kind of want to
say it's kind of evil.

23:34.977 --> 23:36.193
During my research,

23:36.279 --> 23:37.728
I came across something
that caught my attention.

23:37.864 --> 23:41.048
I traced the property deed
back more than 130 years

23:41.167 --> 23:42.416
and couldn't believe

23:42.535 --> 23:44.435
that the average person
stayed there less than three.

23:44.520 --> 23:45.803
It just doesn't seem right.

23:45.888 --> 23:48.572
I'm heading over to meet
with a local real estate agent

23:48.708 --> 23:50.674
to see if this is as
strange as it sounds.

23:58.958 --> 24:00.763
Now, Fred, when I
pulled the chain of title

24:00.863 --> 24:01.996
on my client's property,

24:02.098 --> 24:02.764
I couldn't believe what I saw.

24:02.864 --> 24:05.748
There was 47 owners in 131 years.

24:05.833 --> 24:07.883
You're a veteran real estate agent.

24:08.002 --> 24:09.235
For that neighborhood,

24:09.320 --> 24:12.738
is frequent turnover on
properties and homes common?

24:12.874 --> 24:16.042
That is a lot of transactions
for any particular area

24:16.144 --> 24:17.893
and this area for certain.

24:17.979 --> 24:20.513
Most people that buy homes there,

24:20.598 --> 24:22.681
they stay there for quite some time.

24:22.767 --> 24:25.017
It's one of the better
and safer neighborhoods

24:25.119 --> 24:27.002
of our whole county.

24:27.121 --> 24:29.071
Now, when you looked
through the records here,

24:29.190 --> 24:30.990
anything stand out?

24:31.125 --> 24:33.826
There were some things
that popped out at me.

24:33.911 --> 24:36.028
For instance, in 1919,

24:36.164 --> 24:38.864
I noticed there were eight
different transactions

24:39.000 --> 24:40.166
just in that one year.

24:40.301 --> 24:42.735
Also, there was a lady that bought it

24:42.837 --> 24:45.171
and only kept it for 10 days.

24:45.273 --> 24:46.839
Wow.

24:46.924 --> 24:49.442
When my chain of title search came in,

24:49.544 --> 24:53.045
I saw all these transactions
when it was a tobacco farm.

24:53.181 --> 24:54.597
But yet the turnovers continued

24:54.715 --> 24:56.499
after my client's
house was built in '89.

24:56.617 --> 24:59.201
They were already the fourth owners.

24:59.287 --> 25:00.369
I just thought that to be odd.

25:00.455 --> 25:01.954
Yeah. Well, no doubt about it.

25:02.039 --> 25:03.322
So the property I'm investigating

25:03.458 --> 25:05.024
has some unusual numbers attached to it.

25:05.109 --> 25:06.125
Very much unusual.

25:06.210 --> 25:08.227
Okay.

25:14.646 --> 25:16.991
I encountered several
entities during my walk,

25:17.091 --> 25:19.942
but the old woman
tormenting the living girl

25:20.027 --> 25:21.643
had me the most concerned.

25:21.745 --> 25:25.047
This old female,

25:25.149 --> 25:28.767
her head was very narrow and long.

25:28.852 --> 25:34.356
And she had long, gray hair.

25:34.491 --> 25:41.597
And she was wrapped around
this young female child,

25:41.732 --> 25:45.701
kind of, "I'm in control of this kid."

25:50.858 --> 25:52.407
Okay. Is this what you saw?

25:54.044 --> 25:56.478
Yes.

26:15.569 --> 26:18.654
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:18.772 --> 26:20.639
we're ready to reveal our findings

26:20.741 --> 26:23.375
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

26:25.012 --> 26:26.945
Amy, I'd like you to
meet Tim and Socorro.

26:27.047 --> 26:29.598
Now, from the time they
moved into this house in 2006,

26:29.717 --> 26:30.618
things were bad.

26:30.718 --> 26:32.134
But things just kept getting worse.

26:32.220 --> 26:35.221
The biggest worry they have is
their two beautiful daughters.

26:37.875 --> 26:39.542
This is Bianca, who's 14,

26:39.627 --> 26:41.560
and this is McKenzie, who just turned 8.

26:41.662 --> 26:43.629
The kids don't feel
safe in their own home,

26:43.731 --> 26:45.297
and it's killing the parents here.

26:45.399 --> 26:48.000
The activity in the home
is tearing the family apart,

26:48.085 --> 26:50.769
and we're their very last hope.

26:52.490 --> 26:53.622
So now that Amy knows a little bit

26:53.741 --> 26:55.074
about what's going
on in the family here,

26:55.159 --> 26:56.742
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

26:58.913 --> 27:01.397
There's a lot going on here,

27:01.516 --> 27:03.816
and I'm gonna start off by discussing

27:03.918 --> 27:07.153
the conscious dead
that I encountered here.

27:07.255 --> 27:09.922
The first individual that I met

27:10.057 --> 27:15.361
was an elderly male
over in the dining area.

27:15.429 --> 27:16.812
He's in his 60s.

27:16.931 --> 27:20.866
And I heard him talking
a lot about hi... a barn.

27:20.952 --> 27:24.303
I think he lived here a long time ago.

27:24.438 --> 27:28.174
He seemed to be pretty
negative and pretty abusive.

27:28.276 --> 27:33.012
And now, in death,
he's still very ornery.

27:33.097 --> 27:35.130
Something he was telling me
is that when he feels like

27:35.216 --> 27:37.166
somebody says or does something stupid,

27:37.251 --> 27:39.185
he'll try to hit them.

27:39.287 --> 27:40.519
And what he was telling me

27:40.621 --> 27:42.488
was that he actually does hit people.

27:42.590 --> 27:46.992
And one of his favorite
things to do is to trip people.

27:47.061 --> 27:50.062
And if they fall down, he gets a laugh.

27:50.147 --> 27:51.780
Yeah, I was standing
at the top of the stairs

27:51.899 --> 27:53.065
and getting ready to come down.

27:53.201 --> 27:55.034
And I go to take a step.

27:55.119 --> 27:57.336
And the next thing I
know, both my feet are out.

27:57.421 --> 27:59.338
I'm at the bottom of the stairs.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.657
It freaked me out. You know?

28:01.742 --> 28:03.108
Tim's an iron worker.

28:03.211 --> 28:05.477
He's used to being on beams and high up.

28:05.613 --> 28:07.680
- Balance is his life.
- Right.

28:07.782 --> 28:09.598
A guy like this doesn't just trip.

28:09.684 --> 28:10.699
No.

28:10.818 --> 28:12.985
Now, you got punched in the back.

28:13.070 --> 28:17.423
Yes. I was walking in
from the laundry room.

28:17.525 --> 28:21.260
And as I turned and was
walking back into the kitchen,

28:21.362 --> 28:22.895
I felt a punch.

28:22.997 --> 28:24.396
It just knocked the wind out of me.

28:24.532 --> 28:26.260
So this sounds like
something this guy would do?

28:26.360 --> 28:29.735
Yeah. Both of those things
would be right up his alley.

28:32.440 --> 28:36.025
The next person that I encountered

28:36.110 --> 28:38.210
was a teenage male.

28:38.312 --> 28:42.047
He was kind of a wild child.

28:42.149 --> 28:44.300
He's kind of crazy and out of control.

28:44.385 --> 28:48.051
Mostly, I saw him upstairs
in the larger bedroom.

28:48.151 --> 28:50.085
He's very noisy, very loud.

28:50.220 --> 28:52.821
He often makes growling noises as well.

28:52.906 --> 28:56.324
It's driving the dead crazy.

28:56.426 --> 28:58.426
This kid's driving
living people crazy, too.

28:58.528 --> 28:59.744
Mm-hmm.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.596
Explain to Amy how
Bianca hears the growling.

29:01.698 --> 29:04.899
She's come running to me several times.

29:05.002 --> 29:06.785
And Tim and I... And we heard it.

29:06.903 --> 29:08.069
What does it sound like?

29:08.171 --> 29:10.005
A dog. But it's not a dog.

29:10.107 --> 29:11.673
Now, Bianca described it to me

29:11.775 --> 29:15.026
as half animal, half possibly human.

29:15.112 --> 29:16.177
Mm-hmm.

29:16.263 --> 29:17.812
I'll never forget that sound.

29:21.435 --> 29:25.437
The next individual
was an elderly female.

29:25.555 --> 29:28.740
So hates the teenage boy.

29:28.825 --> 29:30.058
Somehow, they're related.

29:30.127 --> 29:32.527
She was also saying that he
gets in the way of everything.

29:32.612 --> 29:37.866
I saw her in each of the
rooms upstairs specifically.

29:37.968 --> 29:41.086
And she's causing trouble.
There's problems there.

29:41.204 --> 29:45.573
I got that she lived here.

29:45.675 --> 29:48.743
She had like six or more siblings

29:48.845 --> 29:52.013
and that she had money.

29:52.115 --> 29:54.149
That's interesting.
Could be a long shot,

29:54.251 --> 29:55.710
but there's a woman who
lived on the property.

29:55.810 --> 29:56.808
Her name was Agnes Wyatt.

29:56.908 --> 29:59.242
Now, Agnes moved here in
1919 with her husband, George,

29:59.327 --> 30:01.027
and their only son, Virgil.

30:01.113 --> 30:03.513
And they came here to farm tobacco.

30:03.598 --> 30:05.348
Now, this is George.

30:07.552 --> 30:12.288
I have a photo of
Virgil I was able to get.

30:12.424 --> 30:15.191
Agnes did come from a wealthy family.

30:15.277 --> 30:17.327
She had six siblings.

30:17.429 --> 30:19.379
There was a couple other
strange things about her.

30:19.498 --> 30:23.099
In 1937, George dies
after gallbladder surgery.

30:23.201 --> 30:26.703
Cholecystitis was what they called it.

30:28.273 --> 30:29.939
Five years later,

30:30.042 --> 30:31.841
Agnes dies of the same exact thing,

30:31.927 --> 30:33.393
which I thought was odd.

30:35.797 --> 30:37.547
Now, Amy, you mentioned

30:37.682 --> 30:41.307
that the woman didn't
like the teenage boy.

30:41.407 --> 30:45.075
Now, when Agnes died, she
cut her only son, Virgil,

30:45.160 --> 30:46.727
out of the will because he was a drunk.

30:46.812 --> 30:48.195
That's a lot of hate.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.696
Yes.

30:49.782 --> 30:51.398
Now, you said the woman
was trouble, though.

30:51.533 --> 30:52.699
Yes. What does she do?

30:52.835 --> 30:59.172
I think that she is possibly
a threat to the living.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.675
When I went upstairs,

31:01.760 --> 31:04.811
I saw her in the lavender bedroom.

31:04.913 --> 31:08.665
And I saw her coming out of the closet,

31:08.784 --> 31:13.987
being like a mist and,
like, hovering over the bed.

31:14.072 --> 31:19.559
So the other thing was that
I saw an unusual relationship

31:19.661 --> 31:22.145
between her and the person,
the female, in that room.

31:22.231 --> 31:29.903
The female there felt like
this was somehow protecting her,

31:30.038 --> 31:33.406
but it was actually making her sick.

31:33.492 --> 31:34.775
That's Bianca's room.

31:34.877 --> 31:36.543
- Bianca's room.
- Okay.

31:36.645 --> 31:39.880
And is Bianca okay up there?

31:39.982 --> 31:41.565
No. She's not.

31:41.650 --> 31:42.816
She doesn't sleep.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.885
She doesn't sleep
because something up there

31:44.970 --> 31:47.187
doesn't let her sleep.

31:48.757 --> 31:53.543
But then, I went into the pink room.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.545
The old lady,

31:55.664 --> 31:59.833
she's very fixated on
the child in that room.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.736
She is always watching her,

32:02.821 --> 32:06.406
tries to be around her
as much as possible,

32:06.508 --> 32:08.041
watches her all the time.

32:08.177 --> 32:09.543
And one of the things that she said

32:09.678 --> 32:11.011
was that she wanted to eat her.

32:13.182 --> 32:15.415
McKenzie will not sleep in her room.

32:15.517 --> 32:18.885
She says that there's something
in her room that bothers her.

32:18.987 --> 32:21.137
She feels like something
is watching her whenever...

32:21.223 --> 32:23.840
Has she ever described
what she's seeing?

32:23.959 --> 32:26.126
McKenzie won't talk
about it. It scares her.

32:26.211 --> 32:28.261
She doesn't like for
us to talk about it.

32:28.330 --> 32:30.714
She'll tell us, "You guys,
stop talking about it."

32:30.833 --> 32:33.250
It just seemed to me like the old lady

32:33.368 --> 32:39.239
had some kind of weird
obsession with McKenzie.

32:40.742 --> 32:45.245
I think that it's her
energy that she's absorbing,

32:45.347 --> 32:46.530
which can be...

32:46.615 --> 32:50.217
have very detrimental
effects on her in her health.

32:50.319 --> 32:51.268
I did a sketch

32:51.353 --> 32:53.820
of what this old woman
is doing to McKenzie.

33:00.829 --> 33:03.330
I'm sorry, guys, to even
show you this, but...

33:06.635 --> 33:08.435
Wow.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.587
It's no wonder she won't sleep up there.

33:10.706 --> 33:11.838
That's scary.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.345
I don't know.

33:19.882 --> 33:22.716
Just so innocent, you know?

33:22.818 --> 33:27.320
No kid should have to go through that.

33:41.268 --> 33:43.935
I'm sorry, guys, to even
show you this, but...

33:46.707 --> 33:48.473
Wow.

33:48.609 --> 33:50.675
It's no wonder she won't sleep up there.

33:51.417 --> 33:52.549
That's scary.

33:57.306 --> 33:59.056
I don't know.

34:00.609 --> 34:03.443
Just so innocent, you know?

34:03.546 --> 34:08.065
No kid should have to go through that.

34:17.493 --> 34:18.626
And that's what she sees

34:18.761 --> 34:21.295
'cause she's told us she
sees something in her room.

34:23.282 --> 34:29.704
I actually got a lot of
information on you guys.

34:29.839 --> 34:32.873
The female of the house
was not in good shape

34:32.958 --> 34:37.545
as far as just mentally and
emotionally and physically.

34:37.612 --> 34:42.683
And I was seeing fights
with a male, a living male.

34:42.768 --> 34:46.853
I got that you were very, very ill,

34:46.989 --> 34:50.257
there were stomach issues, heart issues.

34:50.342 --> 34:54.795
I experienced a lot of
different emotions...

34:54.897 --> 35:00.501
depression, anxiety, and
then feeling panic attacks.

35:00.570 --> 35:02.570
Whoa.

35:02.655 --> 35:05.206
I could feel all of
this pain and misery.

35:05.291 --> 35:07.942
It was excruciating for me,

35:08.044 --> 35:10.344
and I got really dizzy from it

35:10.430 --> 35:13.114
and, like, kind of fell to my knees.

35:13.249 --> 35:14.949
Amy, you hit on just about...

35:15.084 --> 35:16.283
Everything.

35:16.419 --> 35:19.070
Everything that made Socorro call us.

35:19.188 --> 35:20.738
I've had panic attacks, anxiety attacks.

35:20.823 --> 35:24.141
She's woken me up because
she couldn't breathe.

35:24.227 --> 35:26.844
You know, there's days where I feel like

35:26.929 --> 35:29.430
I'm just crawling out of my own skin.

35:29.515 --> 35:31.599
I am angry,

35:31.684 --> 35:34.268
screaming and yelling
and just not myself.

35:34.370 --> 35:35.903
Mm-hmm.

35:36.005 --> 35:39.256
I feel as if I'm going crazy.

35:39.375 --> 35:43.561
I've got medical issues that
can't be explained with my leg.

35:43.646 --> 35:45.646
I've been to doctors and specialists,

35:45.782 --> 35:47.681
and nobody can tell me what's wrong.

35:47.817 --> 35:50.084
Now, you mentioned fighting.

35:50.169 --> 35:51.352
Yes.

35:51.437 --> 35:53.404
It's like I can't do
anything right, you know,

35:53.523 --> 35:55.106
and she probably feels the same way.

35:55.191 --> 35:57.958
And the girls don't
need to be seeing it.

35:58.044 --> 35:58.959
This is it.

35:59.095 --> 36:00.511
You're our last hope.

36:00.630 --> 36:03.230
Just to know, you know, what's going on

36:03.366 --> 36:05.649
and I almost feel like, you know,

36:05.735 --> 36:07.551
to prove to Tim that I'm not crazy.

36:07.670 --> 36:09.070
Oh, no. Yeah.

36:09.155 --> 36:10.738
I'm not crazy.
I... I...

36:10.823 --> 36:12.957
Even though I feel like that a lot.

36:15.378 --> 36:19.847
The last thing I feel very,
very concerned about...

36:19.949 --> 36:24.568
What I saw was a hill,
and the ground was rolling.

36:24.687 --> 36:27.121
And it was making me very nervous.

36:27.223 --> 36:31.092
And I saw, like, through the earth.

36:31.194 --> 36:34.695
And I saw, like, these little things.

36:34.797 --> 36:36.697
They mostly stay in the ground.

36:36.833 --> 36:39.033
And I got, like, some kind of burial

36:39.135 --> 36:41.952
that they were, in fact, human once.

36:42.071 --> 36:43.737
But now, they're, like,

36:43.823 --> 36:47.641
these humanoid shadow creature things.

36:47.710 --> 36:49.276
Mm-hmm.

36:49.378 --> 36:52.680
And when I was in the master bedroom,

36:52.765 --> 36:55.382
I saw that at least two to four of them

36:55.468 --> 36:57.418
had started to surround you

36:57.520 --> 37:02.740
and that you were or
had seen these things

37:02.859 --> 37:06.060
or were and had felt them.

37:06.145 --> 37:07.862
The thing about
these things...

37:07.964 --> 37:11.715
They won't go to someone

37:11.801 --> 37:16.303
unless that person is
in bad shape already.

37:16.389 --> 37:21.258
So, like, if that person
is unhappy or stressed out

37:21.377 --> 37:25.462
or in a negative situation,
they start to come.

37:25.581 --> 37:27.248
You do see shadow people.

37:27.383 --> 37:30.384
I see shadow people all the time.

37:30.486 --> 37:32.086
Does that mean I'm doing it?

37:32.171 --> 37:33.420
Not on purpose.

37:33.523 --> 37:36.824
Well, when I go outside, I
feel like I'm being watched.

37:36.926 --> 37:40.327
Oh, yeah. You're being
watched. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

37:40.429 --> 37:42.947
In my bedroom,

37:43.065 --> 37:45.299
I don't sleep with my back to the wall

37:45.384 --> 37:47.401
because I feel
something's staring at me.

37:47.486 --> 37:49.220
Is this something that can hurt me?

37:49.338 --> 37:50.337
Yes.

37:50.473 --> 37:53.524
They could hurt your body.

37:53.643 --> 37:55.860
So make you sick.

37:55.945 --> 37:59.847
The ones that are around you
now are always around you.

37:59.932 --> 38:03.384
Are they around her right
now, these shadow things?

38:06.255 --> 38:08.022
Yes.

38:08.090 --> 38:10.858
They're over there.

38:10.993 --> 38:12.993
Oh, my gosh.

38:13.095 --> 38:14.778
Now, did you see anything else?

38:14.897 --> 38:16.163
No.

38:16.265 --> 38:18.115
So there's one other thing
I need to tell you about

38:18.201 --> 38:19.283
'cause it's on your property.

38:19.402 --> 38:21.752
Maybe somehow it's
related. I don't know.

38:21.871 --> 38:24.438
Back in 1939, when
this was a tobacco farm,

38:24.523 --> 38:27.841
there were seven guys working
out in the field right here,

38:27.944 --> 38:29.810
trying to get the crops
ready to get stored.

38:29.912 --> 38:32.162
Well, a storm came through.

38:32.281 --> 38:34.331
They tried to outrun the storm.

38:34.450 --> 38:37.701
Lightning hit them.
All seven got struck.

38:37.787 --> 38:39.920
Four of them died.

38:40.006 --> 38:42.122
Their death certificates
here. Four guys.

38:42.225 --> 38:43.457
Three wives became widows,

38:43.542 --> 38:45.593
and two kids lost their father that day.

38:45.678 --> 38:46.894
- Wow.
- Wow.

38:46.996 --> 38:50.464
That's kind of crazy, actually.

38:50.566 --> 38:51.849
Do you think these guys

38:51.968 --> 38:53.567
could be the shadow people
you saw on the hills outside?

38:53.669 --> 38:56.537
No. I think they go
back hundreds of years,

38:56.672 --> 38:58.472
possibly Native Americans.

38:58.574 --> 39:02.343
I don't think that
this land is very good.

39:06.954 --> 39:08.888
Well, Socorro, when I spoke
to you and your family,

39:08.990 --> 39:10.256
I knew things were bad.

39:10.341 --> 39:13.692
But I didn't know it would be this bad.

39:13.778 --> 39:15.928
And I'm sorry for that. I really am.

39:16.063 --> 39:19.999
I know you guys have heard stuff
tonight that's really troubling.

39:20.101 --> 39:21.600
But the big question is,

39:21.702 --> 39:25.487
can you guys raise your
two daughters here in peace?

39:25.606 --> 39:29.642
So for that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:29.727 --> 39:32.428
There's a lot of stuff
that you guys need to do.

39:32.546 --> 39:35.481
And the steps you need to take

39:35.616 --> 39:38.867
need to happen relatively quickly.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.616
So it's going to be intense.

39:41.752 --> 39:44.169
First thing you're gonna do is

39:44.288 --> 39:47.089
you're gonna contact a Reiki master.

39:47.815 --> 39:49.381
This person will come in,

39:49.500 --> 39:52.501
and they will remove all
of the negative energy

39:52.586 --> 39:53.585
from the house.

39:53.671 --> 39:54.837
And they will bring in

39:54.972 --> 39:57.790
only positive, balanced,
harmonious energy

39:57.875 --> 39:58.676
into the house.

39:58.776 --> 40:01.177
It's very important in this situation

40:01.312 --> 40:06.999
because the energy in
the house is so negative.

40:07.118 --> 40:12.088
And your bodies are
encountering this negativity.

40:12.223 --> 40:14.356
And when they do that cleansing,

40:14.442 --> 40:17.476
they're going to remove
all negative attachments,

40:17.595 --> 40:20.413
which means those...

40:20.531 --> 40:21.564
- The shadow things.
- Yes.

40:21.699 --> 40:23.399
And with McKenzie,

40:23.534 --> 40:26.335
it'll remove the dead woman from her.

40:26.437 --> 40:26.729
Oh.

40:26.829 --> 40:30.486
So here's the key. You've got 24 hours.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.047
They're gonna want to reattach.

40:37.135 --> 40:42.739
So the next thing that needs
to be done within 24 hours...

40:42.874 --> 40:46.876
I want the same Reiki master
to come back with a medium.

40:46.978 --> 40:51.281
They're going to help move on
the dead that are in the house.

40:51.383 --> 40:55.385
So then they're gone,
and y'all are balanced.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.854
And the house is harmonious.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.589
So after everything's done,

40:59.691 --> 41:01.825
will McKenzie at least
sleep in her own room?

41:01.910 --> 41:02.792
Yes.

41:02.894 --> 41:04.761
- Oh.
- Yes.

41:04.863 --> 41:07.380
When you came to us
to come do this case,

41:07.499 --> 41:08.398
you were done.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.667
I was at my breaking point.

41:10.752 --> 41:12.702
But now, you've got a game plan.

41:12.788 --> 41:15.255
And we've got a plan
and we know what to do.

41:15.374 --> 41:16.656
Are you gonna take her advice?

41:16.742 --> 41:19.109
Yeah. For my family. I'd
do anything for my family.

41:19.211 --> 41:20.443
All right. Good. I'm glad to hear that.

41:20.529 --> 41:22.011
It's gonna be a family thing,

41:22.097 --> 41:24.347
and I think it's gonna
not only bring us closer

41:24.449 --> 41:25.849
but have closure...

41:25.934 --> 41:26.933
Mm-hmm.

41:27.052 --> 41:28.184
And start a new chapter.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.522
I really feel for Socorro,

41:32.624 --> 41:36.493
as the dead tormenting her
family present a serious danger.

41:36.595 --> 41:39.496
But with the help of a
medium and a Reiki master,

41:39.598 --> 41:42.298
they'll be able to rid
their home of the dead

41:42.401 --> 41:45.001
and the negative energy surrounding it.
