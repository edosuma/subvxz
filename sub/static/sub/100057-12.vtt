♪ Ah ♪

00:03.977 --> 00:08.681
♪ Men ♪

00:08.706 --> 00:09.859
Wow.

00:09.914 --> 00:11.269
Here it comes.

00:11.294 --> 00:14.046
"Wow, glad my wife is dead so
she didn't have to hear that."

00:14.071 --> 00:15.102
Actually, I was about to say,

00:15.126 --> 00:18.009
"Wow, you have never sounded better."

00:18.034 --> 00:21.054
Which is still a low bar.
I'm sorry, I can't help myself.

00:21.079 --> 00:22.992
So do you think we're
ready for regionals?

00:23.017 --> 00:24.949
Absolutely,
I think we have a shot at winning.

00:24.974 --> 00:26.156
There we go.

00:26.181 --> 00:28.179
Speaking of regionals, I have good news:

00:28.204 --> 00:30.872
I spoke to the pastor at our
sister church in Lexington,

00:30.897 --> 00:33.364
and she said we could sleep
on their sanctuary floor.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.170
- Are you serious?
- I know, right?!

00:35.195 --> 00:37.351
It'll be like camping in God's tent.

00:37.376 --> 00:39.476
No, sleeping in a drafty church

00:39.501 --> 00:40.833
the night before a performance

00:40.858 --> 00:42.718
would be terrible for your voices.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.734
We can think of the draft
as God blowing us a kiss.

00:45.759 --> 00:47.257
I'm not sleeping on the floor.

00:47.282 --> 00:48.351
What am I? A dog?

00:48.376 --> 00:50.365
- Or a Wayne?
- None taken.

00:50.390 --> 00:52.203
We don't have enough money for a hotel.

00:52.228 --> 00:53.629
Normally, I would offer to pay,

00:53.654 --> 00:55.242
but I'm "Leveraged to the Max."

00:55.267 --> 00:56.734
Which, by the way, is the name

00:56.759 --> 00:59.585
of the expensive racehorse
I invested all my money in.

00:59.610 --> 01:01.007
What if we raised the money?

01:01.032 --> 01:03.570
I mean, we raise the roof all the time.

01:03.595 --> 01:05.343
What-what?

01:06.335 --> 01:08.304
Or we could just have a bake sale.

01:08.329 --> 01:11.179
- Or a car wash.
- Or we make up a guy,

01:11.204 --> 01:13.593
take out a credit card in his name,
max it out,

01:13.618 --> 01:15.117
then write his obituary.

01:15.142 --> 01:19.195
I'm thinking about calling him
"Zachary P. Whisperbone."

01:19.220 --> 01:22.070
No, we're musicians.
It needs to be music-related.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.693
You said "we."

01:24.718 --> 01:26.796
You feel like you belong.

01:26.821 --> 01:28.831
We are an "us."

01:28.856 --> 01:31.890
Calm down, it's just a pronoun.
It's not a promise ring.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.850
Anyway I was reading
this church choir blog

01:34.890 --> 01:37.107
about raising money
through a Hymn-A-Thon.

01:37.132 --> 01:39.508
People pledge money for us to sing.

01:41.201 --> 01:42.624
- "Us."
- Walk away.

01:42.649 --> 01:44.149
"Church choir blog."

01:44.174 --> 01:46.709
Yeah, they have some really
good ideas about choirs,

01:46.734 --> 01:48.546
and terrible ideas
about everything else.

01:48.571 --> 01:51.584
Dibs on anything
Beyonce, Madonna, Lizzo.

01:51.609 --> 01:55.226
It's Rizzo, and no, we're not
doing anything from "Grease."

01:55.251 --> 01:56.551
Traditional choir music only.

01:56.576 --> 01:58.442
A Hymn-A-Thon! I love it!

01:58.467 --> 02:00.388
All in favor sing "I!"

02:00.749 --> 02:03.221

02:10.967 --> 02:13.443
I think a Hymn-A-Thon is dumb as hell.

02:15.050 --> 02:17.585
Synced & corrected by QueenMaddie
www.addic7ed.com

02:23.359 --> 02:27.224
I'm so sorry to hear
about Buster's passing.

02:27.249 --> 02:30.545
21 is too young for a cat to die.

02:30.570 --> 02:34.352
Our choir would love to
sing a hymn in his honor

02:34.354 --> 02:38.201
for the low, low cost of $5.

02:38.226 --> 02:41.171
For $10, we can make it really special.

02:41.711 --> 02:43.439
Can I help you?

02:43.464 --> 02:45.096
A friend of mine lives nearby,

02:45.098 --> 02:47.273
and I seem to have
gotten a little bit lost.

02:47.298 --> 02:50.570
Yeah, you don't look like
you live this far from I-75.

02:50.595 --> 02:52.023
What gave me away? The hat,

02:52.048 --> 02:54.615
the keen sense of intelligence
that permeates every sentence,

02:54.640 --> 02:56.562
or the full set of teeth?

02:57.110 --> 02:59.812
Is that by chance your friend?

02:59.837 --> 03:02.249
The one man not in overalls? Yes.

03:02.274 --> 03:03.274
Arthur!

03:03.716 --> 03:06.028
Tate! What are you doing here?

03:06.365 --> 03:08.039
Music conference in Nashville.

03:08.064 --> 03:10.820
- Wow.
- I skipped out early just to see you.

03:10.845 --> 03:12.935
Plus, it was all downhill
after the keynote speaker.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.039
- Were you the speaker?
- I was.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.890
My keynote was C-sharp.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.434
It killed at the conference.

03:18.827 --> 03:20.465
Ginny, this is Tate Tippet,

03:20.467 --> 03:23.735
who is also an idiosyncratic
Princeton music professor

03:23.737 --> 03:24.968
who judges people harshly.

03:24.993 --> 03:28.050
Oh, cool, I'm so excited
for there to be two of you.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.171
I wanna catch up,
but if you'll excuse me,

03:30.196 --> 03:32.387
I left my car unlocked,
and everyone in here

03:32.412 --> 03:35.146
looks like they could teach
a master class in hot-wiring.

03:35.874 --> 03:37.626
Better safe than sorry.

03:37.882 --> 03:40.570
Aw, you have a friend. Isn't that nice?

03:40.595 --> 03:42.851
He is the only person
on the whole campus

03:42.876 --> 03:45.734
who had my back when I
was unfairly dismissed.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.453
Are we still calling that unfair?

03:47.478 --> 03:48.570
I mean, didn't you, like,

03:48.595 --> 03:50.405
throw a piece of furniture at a child?

03:50.430 --> 03:53.899
I gently tossed a chair
that landed near a student.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.500
It was student adjacent.

03:55.502 --> 03:58.737
I don't mind if you talk back,
but please use your diaphragm.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.545
Also, don't talk back.

04:02.984 --> 04:05.929
I like this town for you.
Might even be a little jealous

04:05.954 --> 04:07.656
that you got away from the rat race.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.820
Hey, Conly Fork has a rat race.

04:09.845 --> 04:11.493
Thursdays by the big fork,

04:11.518 --> 04:15.140
although a small possum
owned by a powerful family

04:15.165 --> 04:16.165
wins every time.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.007
Wherever you go,
you can't get away from politics.

04:18.031 --> 04:20.536
There is the hardened
cynic I fell in love with.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.773
Ooh. Oh shoot.

04:22.798 --> 04:24.460
I have to head over to the church

04:24.498 --> 04:26.277
for an all-night sing-a-long.

04:28.624 --> 04:31.154
- Aw, you're serious.
- Mmhmm.

04:31.179 --> 04:32.490
Well, that's too bad.

04:32.515 --> 04:34.937
I was hoping you'd come
out and celebrate with me.

04:35.142 --> 04:38.076
You're looking at the new
chair of the music department.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.710
What?

04:40.375 --> 04:42.092
Congratulations!

04:42.117 --> 04:44.897
Finally a visionary at the helm!

04:44.922 --> 04:45.922
Thanks, man.

04:45.947 --> 04:49.529
That means a lot coming
from the best professor

04:49.554 --> 04:52.124
to ever steal my lunch
from the faculty fridge.

04:52.149 --> 04:54.102
Hey, that baba ghanoush
was for everyone.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.414
We need to celebrate.

04:55.439 --> 04:57.094
- We should be drinking.
- We are drinking.

04:57.118 --> 04:59.093
What if I were to tell
you I know of a place

04:59.118 --> 05:01.719
that has bourbon and clean glasses?

05:01.744 --> 05:04.046
- What if I were to say, "hell yes."
- Hell yeah.

05:04.382 --> 05:08.662
I got us a great rate
at a hotel in Lexington!

05:08.687 --> 05:10.108
And then I got us a good rate

05:10.110 --> 05:12.398
at a hotel in Lexington, Kentucky!

05:12.930 --> 05:14.122
So, all we gotta do

05:14.147 --> 05:17.315
is raise 1,000 bucks,
and we will be all set.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.117
Ooo, this'll help us keep track.

05:19.996 --> 05:20.996
Fancy.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.664
I think it's cute you think
you know what fancy is.

05:23.689 --> 05:25.484
I just hooked us up to
our social media page

05:25.509 --> 05:26.953
so people can watch us sing.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.070
Oh, no!

05:28.095 --> 05:30.789
My gram gram follows us,
and she's a huge troll.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.841
Hey, uh, change of plans.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.766
Uh, I can help you guys get ready,

05:34.768 --> 05:37.535
but I gotta take my buddy out
to celebrate his promotion.

05:37.537 --> 05:41.162
Not to oversell, but everything
in my life depends on this.

05:41.187 --> 05:42.979
- Shoulders back.
- You're bailing on the Hymn-A-Thon?

05:43.003 --> 05:45.954
Tate has always been
my biggest booster...

05:45.979 --> 05:48.267
Lose the gum...
They promoted him to chair...

05:48.292 --> 05:50.617
- So you wanna throw him?
- Of the department.

05:50.642 --> 05:51.955
Shut up. So I'm gonna to take him out.

05:51.979 --> 05:54.030
I'm gonna show him a good time,
I'm gonna get my job back,

05:54.054 --> 05:56.408
and finally I can pull
myself out of the muck.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.556
Are we the muck?

05:58.558 --> 06:01.361
No, you're the... the gross...

06:01.386 --> 06:02.771
creatures who befriended me

06:02.796 --> 06:06.226
when I was in the muck,
and I will never forget you.

06:06.251 --> 06:08.010
Hit middle C.
You know where middle C is?

06:08.035 --> 06:10.235
Yeah? That's it, that's your anchor.

06:10.237 --> 06:12.267
Stay close to that.
You guys are gonna be great.

06:12.292 --> 06:14.861
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah, I got a note.

06:14.886 --> 06:17.786
- ♪ You suck ♪

06:17.811 --> 06:21.337

06:22.709 --> 06:24.844
I can't believe Arthur abandoned us.

06:24.869 --> 06:26.096
Although, to be fair, it falls in line

06:26.120 --> 06:28.711
with every other terrible
aspect of his personality.

06:28.736 --> 06:31.914
Never trust a man with that
many decorative scarves.

06:31.939 --> 06:33.672
Who's he think he is? Johnny Depp?

06:33.674 --> 06:35.922
He can't out-scarf Depp. No one can.

06:35.947 --> 06:38.944
You can try, but Depp
will just put on another scarf,

06:38.946 --> 06:40.880
and where does that leave you?
I'll tell you.

06:40.905 --> 06:42.847
One scarf behind Depp.

06:42.849 --> 06:44.622
Okay, enough. Ya'll!

06:44.647 --> 06:46.518
- We can do this!
- Aw.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.358
Remember when Arthur said "we"?

06:48.383 --> 06:49.515
I will lead us.

06:49.540 --> 06:51.199
We got along fine before Arthur.

06:51.224 --> 06:54.020
We can do it again.
So now, let's get out there,

06:54.045 --> 06:56.184
and let's sing like nobody's watching!

06:56.209 --> 06:57.756
- Yeah!
- But hopefully they will be!

06:57.780 --> 06:59.856
- Yeah!
- Can I get a what-what?

06:59.881 --> 07:00.966
- What?
- What?

07:01.850 --> 07:03.735
That's the spirit!

07:03.737 --> 07:06.888
- Bibs, the usual.
- You have a usual?

07:06.913 --> 07:08.591
Amazing. Make it two.

07:08.616 --> 07:11.991
Okay, so four Winter Creek
Bourbons, neat. Comin' up.

07:12.016 --> 07:13.920
Bibs, you're looking at
the best instrumentalist

07:13.945 --> 07:15.378
in all of North America.

07:15.403 --> 07:17.567
- Jazz Piano...
- Industrial bassoon...

07:17.592 --> 07:19.006
Ska sitar.

07:19.031 --> 07:21.349
So what's it gonna take to get
this guy in the lineup tonight?

07:21.373 --> 07:23.888
Aw, I don't know. It's cover band night.

07:23.890 --> 07:25.506
I don't wanna bump Shammy Hagar.

07:25.531 --> 07:26.902
Bibs, you gotta help me out here.

07:26.927 --> 07:28.460
I need to butter this guy up.

07:28.462 --> 07:30.247
He may have a job for me at Princeton,

07:30.272 --> 07:32.330
which means you will never
have to listen to someone say,

07:32.332 --> 07:34.595
"could you please switch the
TV to the opera channel,"

07:34.620 --> 07:35.873
ever again.

07:37.155 --> 07:40.392
Hey, Mr. Sitar! You're up next.

07:40.608 --> 07:42.084
- Hello world!
- Hi.

07:42.109 --> 07:44.583
We are the Second First Church Choir,

07:44.608 --> 07:47.731
and we welcome you to our
all night Hymn-A-Thon.

07:47.756 --> 07:49.739
- Hi.
- Ooh, look!

07:49.764 --> 07:51.653
A little heart is floating!

07:51.678 --> 07:53.982
Social media love is addictive.

07:54.295 --> 07:56.809
But not as addictive as God's love.

07:58.756 --> 08:03.824
Our first hymn is dedicated
to Mrs. Elliot's cat, Buster,

08:03.849 --> 08:06.404
who died doing what he loved:

08:06.803 --> 08:08.668
having diabetes.

08:08.693 --> 08:12.925

08:37.164 --> 08:38.830
I was pissed when I got bumped,

08:38.832 --> 08:41.566
but I'll be honest, this guy's good!

08:41.591 --> 08:43.501
Hey, I'm trying to give
my buddy a good night.

08:43.503 --> 08:46.238
If you ask for an encore,
I'll buy your next beer.

08:50.911 --> 08:54.300
What are we, like, the
lamest frat house on campus?

08:54.325 --> 08:55.519
These pledges suck.

08:55.544 --> 08:58.349
Come on, Conley Fork!
Send us to regionals.

08:58.351 --> 08:59.751
Come on! Please, please!

09:02.294 --> 09:05.379
"I will donate $5 if
everyone stops speaking,

09:05.404 --> 09:08.013
and the big guy with
the voice says my name."

09:09.419 --> 09:10.785
"Not him."

09:10.810 --> 09:12.731
Oh, rude.

09:16.091 --> 09:17.457
Joanne.

09:18.185 --> 09:19.215
Keep going.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.254
- Come on.
- It's working.

09:21.279 --> 09:22.754
_

09:22.779 --> 09:24.042
Joanne.

09:25.304 --> 09:27.689
All right! They loved you.

09:27.714 --> 09:29.310
I haven't seen them that worked up

09:29.335 --> 09:31.652
since the "Suzanne Duran" reunion.

09:31.677 --> 09:33.384
Fun crowd. You should get up there.

09:33.386 --> 09:36.130
If I killed it,
you could at least wound it.

09:36.155 --> 09:38.033
Tate, let's cut to the chase.

09:38.318 --> 09:40.146
I know you came here with an agenda.

09:40.171 --> 09:41.203
You do?

09:41.228 --> 09:43.361
Yeah, nobody comes to
Kentucky voluntarily.

09:43.363 --> 09:44.729
Not even LSU.

09:44.731 --> 09:46.097
All right.

09:46.099 --> 09:49.267
Tate, yes, of course, I'd love to.

09:49.269 --> 09:51.636
I forgive them. Show me where to sign.

09:51.638 --> 09:53.404
I don't care about the salary.

09:53.406 --> 09:57.699
Oh, oh, oh, um... you...

09:57.724 --> 09:59.465
You think I'm here to offer you a job?

09:59.490 --> 10:04.715
I did... until... just now.

10:08.318 --> 10:09.821
So I won't. Your career is dead,

10:09.823 --> 10:11.886
and you're never gonna
teach again at Princeton.

10:11.911 --> 10:13.825
- Encore!
- Ugh.

10:13.827 --> 10:15.591
I know this is not great timing.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.244
Shammy Hagar, do me a favor.

10:22.482 --> 10:24.936
Plunge that pint glass into my skull.

10:28.026 --> 10:29.535
Gotta give the people what they want.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.701
Encore!

10:30.726 --> 10:32.887
I'm not buying you any more beer.

10:32.912 --> 10:34.083
Withdrawn.

10:34.108 --> 10:35.161
So you came all this way

10:35.186 --> 10:37.997
just to rub my face in
my non-existent future?

10:38.022 --> 10:40.495
No, I came all this way

10:40.520 --> 10:43.201
to get you to sign a letter of apology,

10:43.226 --> 10:46.576
indemnifying the school
from any legal action.

10:46.601 --> 10:48.247
Apology? For what?

10:48.272 --> 10:50.572
You always said students
were a bunch of snowflakes

10:50.597 --> 10:52.073
who needed to toughen up.

10:52.098 --> 10:53.896
They do, but...

10:53.921 --> 10:55.844
times have changed.

10:55.869 --> 10:58.703
We just gave a professor paid
leave while we investigate

10:58.728 --> 11:01.669
her use of the term "flame retardant."

11:01.694 --> 11:03.247
I thought you had my back.

11:03.272 --> 11:06.543
Actually, yeah, I did,
but I'm an administrator now.

11:06.568 --> 11:07.945
I gotta make an example of you.

11:07.947 --> 11:10.107
I can't believe Tate Tippet
sold me out for a paycheck.

11:10.132 --> 11:12.099
In my defense,

11:12.333 --> 11:14.585
it's a really big paycheck.

11:16.055 --> 11:17.615
You seriously won't sign?

11:17.640 --> 11:20.274
I may be screwed, but so are you.

11:21.099 --> 11:23.961
Hey, man, you see that guy at the bar

11:23.963 --> 11:26.731
who spent $300 on that stupid fedora?

11:26.733 --> 11:29.521
He just told me he thinks
he could take you, easy.

11:30.158 --> 11:32.466
Nobody takes Sqwatchy easy.

us to do weird crap now.

No, no, no, no, no.
We can't call it quits.

15:23.679 --> 15:25.046
And we're...

15:25.071 --> 15:28.516
_

you didn't get the job?

16:05.803 --> 16:08.835
That job or any other apparently,

16:08.860 --> 16:11.484

16:11.509 --> 16:12.718
Oh, no. No, no, no.

16:12.743 --> 16:15.687
It's just Junior's extended
family and a bunch of pervs.

16:15.712 --> 16:17.593
- I'm sorry, Arthur.
- No!

16:17.618 --> 16:18.837
I thought I was so important that

16:18.861 --> 16:20.243
the rules didn't apply to me.

16:20.268 --> 16:22.665
- It's hubris.
- Like Oedipus!

16:23.102 --> 16:25.499
It was a trivia question
on my string cheese.

16:25.524 --> 16:27.813
I deserved to get fired. I'm a dick.

16:27.838 --> 16:30.797
Well, the first step to
healing is admitting it.

16:30.822 --> 16:34.323
Unless you committed a crime,
then it's deny, deny, deny.

16:34.325 --> 16:35.791
And the fact you feel bad about it

16:35.793 --> 16:36.909
shows just how much you've grown.

16:36.933 --> 16:38.775
I was kinda hoping
someone was gonna object

16:38.800 --> 16:39.948
to the whole, "I'm a dick," thing.

16:39.972 --> 16:42.308
I do, but only because I have

16:42.333 --> 16:44.494
more clever and specific insults.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.314
Kimberly said she'll pay
$10 to hear those insults.

16:48.339 --> 16:49.822
I got you, girl.

16:49.847 --> 16:52.151
Hey, guys, I know I said that
we should do anything

16:52.176 --> 16:53.704
to get to regionals, but...

16:54.344 --> 16:58.025
we don't turn on our friends
when they need us the most.

16:58.282 --> 16:59.812
Thank you.

16:59.837 --> 17:01.554
And when you feel better,

17:01.579 --> 17:04.376
we should have some words,
because you are a real dick.

17:04.401 --> 17:07.126
Look, I can't un-toss the chair.

17:07.717 --> 17:10.525
I can't un-abandon the Hymn-A-Thon,

17:10.550 --> 17:13.181
and the fact that that
doesn't sound strange to me

17:13.205 --> 17:15.095
means I've been in Kentucky too long.

17:15.119 --> 17:20.095

is I can help you raise this money.

17:20.119 --> 17:22.854

of the other way around?

17:26.823 --> 17:29.189
Because I look good as
hell in these pajamas.

17:29.214 --> 17:32.158
They're not churchgoing people,
but I do know a place

17:32.183 --> 17:34.462

19:51.198 --> 19:52.786
Next time we do a Hymn-A-Thon

19:52.811 --> 19:55.378
can we not do it the night
before I have a morning shift?

19:55.403 --> 19:57.693
- That's like your fifth cup.
- You got that right.

19:57.695 --> 19:59.130
Why don't you just get an enema?

19:59.155 --> 20:01.155
You put it on the menu, I'll order it.

20:01.469 --> 20:03.255
I should take this.

20:03.280 --> 20:04.575
Dang it, Brian,

20:04.600 --> 20:06.514
you better not be calling
to take back your offer.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.568
We had a verbal contract.
That's a thing idn't it?

20:09.593 --> 20:12.785
It is, and we have a firm
no backsies policy.

20:12.810 --> 20:15.544
Oh, kindergarten rules. I respect that.

20:15.569 --> 20:16.935
You've a tough negotiator.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.858
In fact, I know this may sound crazy,

20:18.883 --> 20:21.445
but would you be
interested in interviewing

20:21.470 --> 20:24.163
for assistant manager
when you're in Lexington?

20:24.500 --> 20:25.500
Oh, yes.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.791
I mean I definitely
would love to interview.

20:28.036 --> 20:31.543
I mean... maybe,
if it's convenient for me.

20:31.568 --> 20:33.598
You're literally going
to be staying here.

20:33.796 --> 20:35.229
What's stopping you?

20:38.810 --> 20:41.449
I'm sorry, uh. I have to think about it.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.682
I'll see you next week.

20:45.242 --> 20:49.105
Oh, that was just normal old
hotel confirmation business.

20:49.130 --> 20:53.590
You know, numbers, letters, J, Q,

20:53.615 --> 20:55.194
seven... You all set here?

20:55.219 --> 20:57.004
Uh, actually, I want some more.

20:57.029 --> 20:58.328
I finally took your advice

20:58.353 --> 21:00.796
and wiped up the gravy with my biscuit.

21:01.650 --> 21:03.630
You sopped!

21:03.655 --> 21:05.404
- You're on the clock.
- Oh.

21:05.429 --> 21:08.319
You know if you guys can
live the rest of your lives

21:08.344 --> 21:11.108
in Conley Fork, so can I.

21:11.133 --> 21:13.374
It is full of the best
people that I know.

21:13.399 --> 21:16.195
You guys gotta come check out
this masterpiece I just drew.

21:16.220 --> 21:18.593
I call it the "Boner Lisa."
