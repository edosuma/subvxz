-Yeah. Yeah.

Isn't it weird that all this,

01:21.193 --> 01:23.661
this all happened
at the end of the semester?

is just a little higher than I expected,

02:43.176 --> 02:45.406

that's what you want to do,

on one of the red bottles,

-That is a giant-ass panda.
-Yeah, it's the best prize in the park.

09:48.942 --> 09:51.410
And that's because this game
is un-winnable.

from 3 inches away.

10:01.820 --> 10:03.082

with a softball,

the right guy to run this game.

on the rides department.

-That's a good question.
-It doesn't really matter.

give him a slight edge.

-Come on.

51:15.360 --> 51:16.384
All right.

-There you go.
-You're so strong-ish.

51:21.132 --> 51:22.190
I'll take that.

51:28.005 --> 51:30.530
(SIGHS) I'm so surprised
I'm making out with you.

51:30.575 --> 51:31.803

Hey, there's a lot of shit in my life.

51:55.333 --> 51:58.131
I'm not ready for this.
I need to take things slow.

51:58.170 --> 52:00.297
Okay, all right.

I'm sorry.

-No, no.

I wouldn't mess around on any of them.

Last summer, there was this drunk idiot
goofing around on the Comet Booster,

52:52.559 --> 52:54.493
trying to kick his buddy.

52:54.527 --> 52:58.554
They found his Reebok
in the parking lot, with his foot in it.

-Yo, Lisa. We're partners today.
-LISA: Great.

53:04.470 --> 53:05.869
So it's official.

53:05.904 --> 53:07.371

hooked me up with a job

53:07.406 --> 53:09.340

on Route 30.

53:14.713 --> 53:18.843
Yeah, I'm gonna go for a 560,
convertible, in gold, leather interior.

53:18.885 --> 53:21.080
I'm even gonna get
a compact disc player.

-(CHUCKLES) It's gonna be insane.
-To the max.

53:24.557 --> 53:27.856
So, hey, Lis, you wanna
go see Judas Priest at Civic Arena?

53:27.894 --> 53:33.093
-My friend Fitzy got me floor seats, so...
-That's okay. Take Boomer.

53:34.334 --> 53:37.428
And go get the hose.
There's dried puke down there.

53:37.470 --> 53:38.835
You don't like Priest?

53:38.871 --> 53:42.204
-I'm busy that night.
-I didn't tell you what night.

53:44.544 --> 53:48.036
James, you and I should go out
some night.

53:48.081 --> 53:51.346
(LAUGHING) I get it, that's a funny one.

53:51.384 --> 53:53.318
Face! Douche.

53:54.153 --> 53:56.383
-Just let me know when.
-Yeah?

53:58.092 --> 53:59.753
Pete, dried puke.

54:07.735 --> 54:12.604
I'm serious. I wouldn't mind going out
with a nice guy for a change.

54:12.640 --> 54:15.234
Cool. Yeah. That would be very cool.

54:15.876 --> 54:17.571
Oh, come on, man!

54:18.344 --> 54:21.711
-Want to push a button?
-No, I'm on games only.

-I know. I work on games, so...
-I'm impressed.

54:35.062 --> 54:37.496
I know.
I shouldn't have even been here.

54:37.531 --> 54:39.192
-Shit.
-Hey.

54:39.433 --> 54:40.923

54:40.968 --> 54:42.060
Hand me the crescent wrench,
would you?

54:42.102 --> 54:43.228
Yeah.

54:44.772 --> 54:48.708
So, Lisa P. just asked me if I wanted
to go out with her sometime.

54:48.742 --> 54:51.210
-Lisa P.?
-Yeah. It's insane.

54:51.245 --> 54:54.578
I think she might've just been trying
to piss off Pete O'Malley but...

54:54.615 --> 54:58.016
Can you imagine any universe where
she would get with a guy like me?

54:58.052 --> 54:59.485
She asked you out?

54:59.520 --> 55:02.683
You're a fucking idiot if you don't go.
It's Lisa P.

55:02.723 --> 55:04.782
-Hold this, would you?
-Yeah.

55:04.825 --> 55:07.350
That girl's a virgin.
Can you believe that?

55:07.394 --> 55:10.227
Oh. In this day and age. You'd think...

55:10.265 --> 55:14.133
Well, she's a Catholic girl.
They usually won't let you screw them.

55:14.168 --> 55:18.298
-But what they will let you do...
-Yeah, but what about Em?

55:19.074 --> 55:23.841
Are you getting all your needs
met by her?

55:26.548 --> 55:28.379
We're taking it slow.

55:29.084 --> 55:32.315
Right. Right. Okay, here's the thing.

55:34.022 --> 55:36.991
Every time you meet a beautiful woman,

55:37.025 --> 55:41.018
don't you imagine what she'd look like
underneath you, naked?

55:41.062 --> 55:44.725
-What? No. No.
-Someone like Lisa P.

55:44.766 --> 55:47.564
I mean, Jesus Christ, it's like
every cell in your body's on fire, right?

55:47.602 --> 55:50.196
That's a little hyperbolic, but, yeah,
I know, I see where you're going.

55:50.238 --> 55:52.934
That's the way we're wired.
It's the way we're wired.

55:52.974 --> 55:56.569
It sucks, but it's just a fact of nature.
It's also tragic.

a shitty movie or something sometime?

57:01.176 --> 57:04.634
(SIGHING) Yeah, I just... You know,
I did something kind of stupid.

we made out.

We got caught up reminiscing.
I was out pretty late.

01:04:27.195 --> 01:04:29.390
But what were you calling about?

01:04:31.633 --> 01:04:35.660
Calling to say sorry. I felt like I was
kind of a jerk the other night.

01:04:37.071 --> 01:04:41.838
Okay. Sorry. Yeah, me, too.
I was drunk.

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:44.204
And I brought you something.

01:04:46.447 --> 01:04:49.211
-This bag?
-Mmm-hmm. What's inside the bag?

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:55.015
-(CHUCKLES) Is that a couple of joints?
-I think so. For pot cookies.

01:04:55.056 --> 01:04:57.490
-Oh, my. You follow through.
-I do.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.855
Cool. This'll be fun.

01:05:00.462 --> 01:05:03.920
-Let's do it.
-Okay. I'm only having half, okay?

into anaphylactic shock? Fuck.

-Brennan, you gonna eat the other half?

all the different ways

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:33.694
"Why are you so far away?" she said

01:05:33.729 --> 01:05:38.666
"Why won't you ever know
that I'm in love with you

In fact, what is so mind-blowing
about this particular race

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:09.887
is how evenly-matched
these particular competitors are.

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:13.661
And Yellow is dead last.
I don't think Yellow's moved once.

01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:17.664
This is a fall from grace
for the once-great stallion, Yellow.

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:21.566
You know, Yellow has inseminated
over 1, 000 foals in his lifetime,

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:23.806
which might explain
his current exhaustion.

01:06:26.249 --> 01:06:30.049

-No!

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:47.497
Yeah, maybe, like, a little bit before.
But no, Bobby,

a bad corn dog before, Bobby.

We're halfway through our set,

01:30:25.307 --> 01:30:26.501
I'm about to wake up any second.

01:30:26.541 --> 01:30:28.771

puts on a guitar,

01:30:28.810 --> 01:30:30.937

of his songs.

-Sorry.

01:30:50.766 --> 01:30:54.497
Yeah, it was bad.
It's blown over now, mostly.

01:31:00.710 --> 01:31:03.076
Not since she quit. You?

01:31:08.050 --> 01:31:12.578
You know the song is called
Satellite of Love, the Lou Reed song.

01:31:12.621 --> 01:31:14.987
You said Shed A Light On Love,
but it's Satellite.

01:31:15.024 --> 01:31:17.356

-Yeah, it's like Skylab.

pull off New York now?

What's the point of being a writer
or an artist anyway?

01:32:05.409 --> 01:32:08.344
Herman Melville wrote
fucking Moby Dick,

01:32:08.377 --> 01:32:10.845
and he was so poor and forgotten
by the time he died

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:14.680
that in his obituary,
they called him Henry Melville.

01:32:14.718 --> 01:32:15.776
You know? Like, why bother?

01:32:15.818 --> 01:32:17.911

Your Herman Melville story,
that's bullshit.

01:32:58.161 --> 01:33:00.595
It's true. They called him Henry.

01:33:00.631 --> 01:33:04.397
No, I mean he wrote
a 700-page allegorical novel

01:33:04.434 --> 01:33:07.130
about the whaling industry.
I think he was...

01:33:07.170 --> 01:33:10.401
I think he was
a pretty passionate guy, Joel.

a little differently than you see yourself.

but I also see the person

who doesn't make apologies for herself.
