WEBVTT

00:07.440 --> 00:10.443
Why did I ever decide to
redecorate my bathroom?

00:10.443 --> 00:12.946
They give you about
1,000 decisions to make.

00:12.946 --> 00:15.949
After a while, you can't
even tell the colors apart.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.951
Roz, perhaps my discerning
decorator's eye

00:17.951 --> 00:19.452
could be
of some assistance.

00:19.452 --> 00:20.453
Let me see here.

00:20.453 --> 00:22.455
This one's Ecru,
that's Eggshell

00:22.455 --> 00:24.457
and this, of course,
is Navajo white.

00:24.457 --> 00:25.358
Very good, Frasier.

00:25.358 --> 00:29.562
Now, let's see how you
do on the color side.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.031
You know, Roz,
I do hope

00:32.031 --> 00:33.967
you don't spend
your entire vacation

00:33.967 --> 00:35.001
redecorating, you know.

00:35.001 --> 00:37.003
You should get out,
you know, have some fun,

00:37.003 --> 00:38.004
maybe take a cruise.

00:38.004 --> 00:40.006
You don't want to stay
in your apartment

00:40.006 --> 00:42.275
cooped up with a bunch
of sweaty workmen.

00:44.944 --> 00:46.279
Bon voyage.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.182
Thank you,
and don't worry.

00:49.182 --> 00:50.683
Chuck Ranberg said
he'd take over...

00:50.683 --> 00:51.985
Absolutely not, Roz.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.219
The man's
speech impediment

00:53.219 --> 00:54.254
made me giggle
all week long.

00:54.254 --> 00:56.556
Show a little compassion.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.291
Oh, come on. You try dealing
with a call screener

00:58.291 --> 01:02.295
who says, "Dr. Cwane, we have
a kweptomaniac on line thwee."

01:02.295 --> 01:05.165
Well, who do you
want to use?

01:05.165 --> 01:06.066
Actually,
I was thinking

01:06.066 --> 01:07.067
of reaching out
to the community.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.568
You know, I was guest
speaker last month

01:08.568 --> 01:10.070
at a program
called Second Start.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.572
They offer career training
to people who are stuck

01:13.073 --> 01:14.074
in tedious, low-paying jobs,

01:14.074 --> 01:17.077
and, uh, well,
I thought I'd give the job

01:17.077 --> 01:18.511
to one of those students.

01:18.511 --> 01:19.446
That's a great idea, Frasier.

01:19.446 --> 01:21.214
It sounds like a great program.

01:21.214 --> 01:22.449
Oh, dear,
there's Chuck Ranberg.

01:22.449 --> 01:23.983
Roz, you've got
to tell him

01:23.983 --> 01:24.918
he doesn't
have the job.

01:24.918 --> 01:25.885
Why can't you
tell him?

01:25.885 --> 01:27.287
I'm sorry.
I can't hear the man speak

01:27.287 --> 01:28.655
without descending
into giggles.

01:28.655 --> 01:30.757
Oh, you are such a child.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.092
Roz, just...

01:32.092 --> 01:33.093
Hi, guys.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.594
Hey, Chuck, how's
it going?

01:34.594 --> 01:36.963
Oh, tewible, Woz.

01:36.963 --> 01:38.798
My wife was in
the cawibbean

01:38.798 --> 01:41.734
and she weft me
for a wastafawian.

01:48.541 --> 01:50.577
FRASIER: You know,
we have a couple of minutes,

01:50.577 --> 01:51.578
before the show, so listen,

01:51.578 --> 01:53.012
tell me a little bit
about yourself.

01:53.012 --> 01:55.014
How did you get
interested in broadcasting?

01:55.014 --> 01:57.016
Well, after I got laid
off from the bakery,

01:57.016 --> 01:58.017
I guess I had
some free time,

01:58.518 --> 02:01.020
so I took a few different
night school courses,

02:01.020 --> 02:02.522
and when I got
to the one in radio,

02:02.522 --> 02:03.456
it all clicked.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.892
Oh, well, now,
isn't that funny.

02:05.892 --> 02:09.162
You know, I had almost
exactly the same experience.

02:09.162 --> 02:11.464
I first discovered psychiatry

02:11.464 --> 02:14.968
in Dr. Bagely's epidemiology
seminar at Harvard.

02:16.703 --> 02:18.505
Except I bet you
didn't walk through

02:18.505 --> 02:20.573
a metal detector
to get to class.

02:20.573 --> 02:22.575
No, no, but you know,
I did have to pass under

02:22.575 --> 02:24.577
a dangerously
unbalanced portrait

02:24.577 --> 02:26.913
of Alfred Adler in the rotunda.

02:26.913 --> 02:29.582
We are practically
separated at birth.

02:29.582 --> 02:31.050
Oh, ten seconds, Mary.
Here we go.

02:31.050 --> 02:32.018
I'm so nervous.

02:32.018 --> 02:33.052
I don't know
what to do.

02:33.052 --> 02:34.053
Oh, you'll be fine.

02:34.053 --> 02:35.555
Just relax.
Okay.

02:41.928 --> 02:43.363
Hello, Seattle.

02:43.363 --> 02:47.567
This is Dr. Frasier Crane,
and I'm listening.

02:47.567 --> 02:48.801
I'd like to take
this opportunity

02:48.801 --> 02:49.736
to introduce someone

02:49.736 --> 02:52.272
who's going to bring
her own flavor to the show

02:52.272 --> 02:54.240
this week while Roz
is gone.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.708
Say hello
to Mary Thomas.

03:01.047 --> 03:02.882
It's great to have you
with us, Mary.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.854
You know, we want to get
right to your calls, folks,

03:07.854 --> 03:09.822
so we'll be right back
after this.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.527
Mary, uh...

03:14.527 --> 03:16.029
I should mention that
you should feel free

03:16.029 --> 03:18.431
to speak on the air.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.733
You know, Roz often chimes in
from time to time.

03:20.733 --> 03:22.669
Oh, I can't believe
I messed up so quickly.

03:22.669 --> 03:24.103
No, no, no,
not at all, not at all.

03:24.103 --> 03:26.940
Promise me you'll speak up
when it feels right.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.775
I will.
Okay, great.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.610
I'm sure you have
excellent instincts.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.545
Five seconds.
Right.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.382
And we're back.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.718
All right, Mary,
who's our first caller?

03:38.718 --> 03:40.553
Maria.

03:43.289 --> 03:45.959
Uh, she's 36 years old.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.761
Married five years,

03:48.761 --> 03:51.130
and her husband's been
staying late at the office

03:51.130 --> 03:52.465
so he can be
with his secretary.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.267
That's the way to do it.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.769
I mean, uh... I...

03:56.769 --> 03:58.137
Sorry, Maria.

03:58.137 --> 04:00.340
Uh,
I'm listening.

04:00.340 --> 04:01.708
Oh, hi, Dr. Crane.

04:01.708 --> 04:04.544
Anyway, he's having an affair
and it's not his first.

04:04.544 --> 04:06.346
This has been going on
since we were newlyweds.

04:06.346 --> 04:08.615
How do I get him to change?

04:08.615 --> 04:10.416
Well, Maria, you,
of course, know

04:10.917 --> 04:13.419
that it's impossible to force
anyone to change,

04:13.419 --> 04:16.723
but you can work
to change yourself.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.057
Usually women
who tolerate

04:18.057 --> 04:19.559
this sort of behavior
from their husbands

04:19.559 --> 04:21.394
are suffering from
low self-esteem issues.

04:21.394 --> 04:22.729
Now, you may need
some counseling

04:22.729 --> 04:24.530
to resolve those issues.
Let me ask...

04:24.530 --> 04:25.765
May I say something?

04:25.765 --> 04:27.600
Yes.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.103
Maria, Dr. Crane
is right.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.904
You must make
a change.

04:31.904 --> 04:34.140
And the first thing you change
is the lock on your front door.

04:34.140 --> 04:35.108
What?

04:35.108 --> 04:36.476
Oh, listen, there's
plenty of time

04:36.476 --> 04:37.343
for counselors,

04:37.343 --> 04:40.346
but at 6:00, locksmiths
start charging extra

04:40.346 --> 04:42.115
so you get on it, girlfriend.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.250
You know,

04:44.250 --> 04:45.585
my Grandpa Willie used to say,

04:45.585 --> 04:48.054
"Nothing stops a man
from playing the field faster

04:48.588 --> 04:50.590
than a night out on the lawn."

04:50.590 --> 04:52.592
Okay? Okay.

04:58.398 --> 05:01.868
Oh, thank you, Grandpa Willie.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.408
Look'ee here, Tony,
you're 35 years old.

05:08.408 --> 05:10.576
Now, your parents only
had you for the first 18,

05:10.576 --> 05:11.944
so if you want to start
blaming someone,

05:11.944 --> 05:13.446
maybe you need to
blame yourself.

05:13.446 --> 05:15.715
Okay? Okay.

05:18.017 --> 05:21.988
Actually, chronic rage problems
usually stem from...

05:21.988 --> 05:24.257
Oh, Dr. Crane,
we're all out of time.

05:28.294 --> 05:29.796
So we are.

05:29.796 --> 05:32.298
Well, then,
this is Dr. Frasier Crane

05:32.298 --> 05:35.134
saying good-bye, Seattle
and good mental health.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.503
And tune in
tomorrow!

05:43.076 --> 05:44.077
Hello, Daphne.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.078
Well, Dr. Crane,

05:45.078 --> 05:46.412
you're in
a good mood today.

05:46.412 --> 05:49.349
Hm-mmm. After six long weeks,

05:49.349 --> 05:51.250
I have finally received
my yellow belt.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.685
Well, aren't you lucky.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.620
I ordered some mauve capri pants
two months ago,

05:54.620 --> 05:57.123
and I'm still waiting.

05:59.559 --> 06:00.560
No, no, no.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.395
As this handsome certificate
will attest,

06:02.395 --> 06:03.763
I finally attained

06:03.763 --> 06:05.264
the second level
of kickboxing.

06:05.264 --> 06:08.267
Oh, congratulations.

06:08.267 --> 06:11.104
What made you take up
kickboxing?

06:11.104 --> 06:12.939
Well, in order to protect Mel.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.440
As you know,
she's a plastic surgeon.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.909
She has a habit of slipping
her card to total strangers

06:16.909 --> 06:19.345
who she feels could use
her services.

06:19.345 --> 06:21.814
So far, no harm done but...

06:21.814 --> 06:22.782
It's only a matter of time

06:22.782 --> 06:24.550
before you get
your lights punched out.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.818
Exactly.

06:25.818 --> 06:27.320
It almost happened last week
with Marjorie Dunsmore.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.821
Luck was on our side,

06:28.821 --> 06:31.824
but next time there might not be
a walker to kick over so...

06:33.226 --> 06:35.161
But I think Dad
will be properly impressed

06:35.661 --> 06:37.530
when I demonstrate
my precision footwork.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.368
Whoa!

06:42.869 --> 06:44.871
That's very impressive,
Dr. Crane.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.372
You know, I just remembered

06:46.372 --> 06:47.373
the Chihuly
needs a good dusting.

06:47.373 --> 06:48.808
Daphne, I thought you
cleaned that yesterday.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.309
Oh, did I?

06:50.309 --> 06:51.811
Hello, Niles. What
brings you here?

06:51.811 --> 06:52.879
Here to demonstrate

06:52.879 --> 06:55.882
my newly acquired
feet of fury.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.485
Carry on, Daphne.

06:59.485 --> 07:00.319
Oh, Frasier, Frasier...

07:00.820 --> 07:02.321
who was that woman
on your show today?

07:02.321 --> 07:04.857
Oh, that was
Mary Thomas.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.360
She's filling in
for Roz this week.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.829
Seemed to me like she
was filling in for you.

07:11.697 --> 07:13.065
You're normally
so particular

07:13.065 --> 07:14.133
about what happens
on your show.

07:14.133 --> 07:16.002
I'm surprised you let her
go on like that.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.870
Well, I started to say something
and then I thought, well...

07:17.870 --> 07:21.741
oh, it just...
might be very condescending.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.209
I know why you
didn't say anything.

07:23.209 --> 07:24.610
'Cause she's black.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.045
Oh, that's ridiculous, Dad.

07:26.045 --> 07:27.313
Race has nothing to do with it.

07:27.313 --> 07:28.848
Oh, come now,
Frasier.

07:28.848 --> 07:31.150
You can't deny a certain measure
of guilt

07:31.150 --> 07:33.653
living as you do in your
exclusive, lily-white world.

07:38.024 --> 07:40.827
Niles, owning the CD
of "Ella sings Gershwin"

07:40.827 --> 07:43.262
does not qualify you
as a soul brother.

07:43.262 --> 07:45.264
You know, Fras,

07:45.264 --> 07:46.732
there's such a
thing as being

07:46.732 --> 07:48.000
too sensitive
about this stuff.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.269
Now, if it was Roz blabbing on
instead of this Mary,

07:50.269 --> 07:52.171
you'd tell her to put
a sock in it, right?

07:52.171 --> 07:53.072
Well, I suppose so,

07:53.573 --> 07:55.074
but, you know, this
is different, Dad.

07:55.074 --> 07:56.075
She's just starting out.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.511
I didn't want to squelch
her enthusiasm.

07:58.511 --> 07:59.846
Because she's black.

07:59.846 --> 08:01.481
Dad, please, will you
just stop saying that?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.282
Anyway,

08:03.282 --> 08:05.585
I just have to deal with it
for a week till Roz gets back.

08:05.585 --> 08:06.185
Black.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.320
Stop it!

08:08.988 --> 08:11.791
My first roommate at Yale
was black.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.759
Huntington Treadwell III?

08:14.260 --> 08:15.261
He's hardly representative

08:15.261 --> 08:16.996
of the African-American
experience, Niles.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.298
His father was a pioneer
in Selma and Montgomery.

08:19.298 --> 08:20.666
Yes, I believe

08:20.666 --> 08:23.536
he built golf courses
all over the South.

08:23.536 --> 08:25.538
Oh, speaking of golf,

08:25.538 --> 08:28.040
Dad, I've become quite
the sportsman myself.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.041
Oh.

08:29.041 --> 08:30.042
What do you think
of that?

08:30.042 --> 08:32.044
Oh, it's very
nice, son.

08:32.044 --> 08:35.381
But calligraphy
really isn't a sport.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.552
It's more of a craft.

08:39.552 --> 08:42.522
No, no, no, this is...
this is for kickboxing.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.524
I finally reached
yellow belt status.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.525
Hey, what do you know?

08:45.525 --> 08:47.026
I'm proud of you.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.528
No, come here.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.132
Well, you know,
it requires a lot of talent.

08:53.132 --> 08:55.067
You know, you have to have
timing and balance...

08:55.067 --> 08:56.502
the ability
to strike

08:56.502 --> 08:57.570
and instantly
retreat.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.504
So, you kick them
and then run away?

08:58.504 --> 09:00.573
Yes, yes.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.074
My instructor says
I'm a natural. Yes.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.576
Can I show you
something?

09:03.576 --> 09:04.577
Oh, yeah, sure.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.078
I'll show you a...
I'll show you

09:06.078 --> 09:08.514
a roundhouse
kick, all right?

09:08.514 --> 09:12.552
You sense
your assailant's presence.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.555
You feel your body
in the space.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.323
Where your opponent is.

09:17.323 --> 09:18.090
And when you're ready...

09:18.591 --> 09:19.592
you strike!

09:20.059 --> 09:21.594
(grunting)

09:26.532 --> 09:28.801
What have I done?

09:28.801 --> 09:31.170
Are you all right,
Daphne?

09:31.170 --> 09:32.572
Yes.
Really?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.073
No. I landed on my wrist.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.374
It's really throbbing.

09:35.374 --> 09:38.177
Oh, go get her
some ice, Niles.

09:38.177 --> 09:39.512
You know, Dad,

09:39.512 --> 09:41.314
perhaps you're right.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.149
Maybe I am too sensitive.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.483
(phone ringing)

09:44.483 --> 09:45.985
Daphne, could you
get that, please?

09:48.154 --> 09:50.690
Gabe, you must remember
that compulsive shopping

09:50.690 --> 09:51.691
is an addiction.

09:51.691 --> 09:54.026
There are no simple solutions.

09:54.026 --> 09:55.428
Oh, I've got one.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.298
Cut those credit cards up
right now.

09:59.298 --> 10:00.833
Okay? Okay.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.668
Thanks, Dr. Mary.

10:02.668 --> 10:06.806
Uh... you know, I hate to be
a stickler here, Gabe,

10:06.806 --> 10:09.141
but as Mary would be
the first to point out,

10:09.141 --> 10:10.142
she is not a doctor.

10:10.643 --> 10:11.544
Oh, I don't mind.

10:11.544 --> 10:12.945
Oh, call me Dr. Mary.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.716
You know, Latifah's not
a real queen, right?

10:19.485 --> 10:20.987
Oh, you know what, doll babies?

10:20.987 --> 10:22.822
We're all out of time
for today.

10:25.691 --> 10:27.026
So we are.

10:27.026 --> 10:29.695
Well, then,
this is Dr. Frasier Crane...

10:29.695 --> 10:31.530
And Dr. Mary!

10:34.533 --> 10:38.537
...saying good-bye, Seattle
and good mental health.

10:42.174 --> 10:43.643
Hey, guys!
Oh, Kenny.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.878
Just checking in to see
how things are going.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.213
Are you kidding?

10:47.213 --> 10:49.215
This is a dream
come true.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.653
So, uh, you and Mary?

10:53.653 --> 10:56.222
What do you
think of her?

10:56.222 --> 10:57.523
Be honest.

10:57.523 --> 11:00.326
Well, I genuinely like her.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.129
She's delightful
and... and... and dedicated.

11:03.129 --> 11:06.465
And?

11:06.465 --> 11:07.900
Well, uh...

11:07.900 --> 11:10.803
she does have a tendency
to sort of jump right in there

11:10.803 --> 11:11.804
whenever she likes, you know,

11:11.804 --> 11:14.807
and frankly, her method
of solving problems

11:14.807 --> 11:16.809
is totally different
than mine.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.678
Yeah, I'm nuts about her, too.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.181
The contrast between you guys...

11:22.181 --> 11:23.683
that's what get things
crackling.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.184
I always thought your show

11:25.685 --> 11:28.187
was the gold standard
of radio shrink chatter,

11:28.187 --> 11:30.156
but this last week
has been even better.

11:30.156 --> 11:31.957
You think so?

11:31.957 --> 11:32.792
Absolutely.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.794
In fact, the boys upstairs

11:34.794 --> 11:36.662
would like to make you two
a permanent team.

11:36.662 --> 11:39.098
Ah... who
am I kidding?

11:39.098 --> 11:40.566
There are no boys upstairs.

11:40.566 --> 11:41.534
I just love this show.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.903
Okay?

11:45.271 --> 11:46.238
This is so exciting.

11:46.238 --> 11:47.506
I cannot believe it.

11:47.506 --> 11:48.874
Me neither.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.142
KENNY: And don't you
worry about Roz.

11:50.142 --> 11:52.445
I'm just going to switch her
over to Gil's show.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.446
The hours are better,

11:53.446 --> 11:55.448
and I'll even throw in
a 20% raise.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.949
This is going to be great.

11:56.949 --> 11:57.950
I bet you within a month,

11:57.950 --> 12:00.419
you guys are going to have
the hottest ratings in Seattle.

12:00.419 --> 12:01.320
Oh, this is so wonderful.

12:01.887 --> 12:02.388
Thank you, both.

12:02.822 --> 12:04.290
I'm going to go
call my parents.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.158
Uh, listen, Kenny...

12:06.158 --> 12:08.160
I know what you're
feeling right now, Doc,

12:08.160 --> 12:09.695
and let me save you
the trouble.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.664
Come here, big guy!

12:12.598 --> 12:14.500
I want some, too.

12:16.000 --> 12:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:25.911 --> 12:27.480
Everything comfy, Daphne?

12:27.480 --> 12:28.481
Here you are.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.982
This quiche should hold you
till dinner.

12:29.982 --> 12:30.983
Oh, Dr. Crane,

12:30.983 --> 12:32.985
you really don't need
to fill in for me.

12:32.985 --> 12:34.253
It's just
a sprained wrist.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.988
I'm perfectly capable
of cooking dinner.

12:35.988 --> 12:37.656
The hell you are.

12:37.656 --> 12:39.925
Daphne, it is the least
I can do, believe me.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.727
Until you're
fully recovered,

12:41.727 --> 12:43.829
consider me
your full-time stand-in.

12:43.829 --> 12:46.098
Uh... oh,
which reminds me, Dad,

12:46.098 --> 12:48.100
I rented
your favorite video.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.469
(laughing):
Death Wish.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.272
Oh, I'll get your beer.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.274
I'm just frosting the mug
in the freezer

12:55.274 --> 12:56.108
the way Daphne does.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.476
I never frost
your beer mug.

12:57.476 --> 12:59.445
Oh, be quiet,
will you?

12:59.445 --> 13:01.447
He's feeling very guilty,

13:01.447 --> 13:03.849
and we have to help him work
through it.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.751
That is just baloney
and you know it.

13:05.751 --> 13:07.753
Shame on you,
taking advantage of your son.

13:07.753 --> 13:09.522
I don't know how you sleep
at night.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.790
Well, pretty good
since he started putting

13:11.290 --> 13:13.626
a mint on my pillow
and a cup of cocoa by the bed.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.295
He never
leaves me cocoa.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.430
You have to fill out
that little card.

13:18.430 --> 13:19.331
Oh.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.869
MARTIN:
Oh, Fras.

13:23.869 --> 13:25.571
How'd the show go?

13:30.743 --> 13:32.745
It was very educational.

13:33.245 --> 13:37.750
Today, Mary taught us
how to manipulate our husbands

13:37.750 --> 13:39.752
by withholding sex.

13:41.620 --> 13:42.521
And she taught us

13:43.022 --> 13:45.391
how to lie to our children
about the past.

13:45.391 --> 13:48.227
Boy, that Dr. Mary
sure goes on and on.

13:48.227 --> 13:49.562
For the last time...

13:49.562 --> 13:51.597
she is not a doctor
no matter how many times

13:51.597 --> 13:52.598
she refers to herself as one.

13:52.598 --> 13:54.600
A cat can have kittens
in the oven

13:54.600 --> 13:57.102
but that don't
make 'em biscuits!

14:01.841 --> 14:07.179
Dear...God,
now I'm quoting Grandpa Willie.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.681
For heaven's
sake, Frasier,

14:08.681 --> 14:09.682
why don't you
just talk to her?

14:09.682 --> 14:11.650
Well, it's a delicate
situation, Niles,

14:11.650 --> 14:13.185
for God's sake.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.687
I mean,
it's not all that easy.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.689
I mean, she is new to the field,
she's sensitive,

14:17.189 --> 14:18.190
she's-she's eager
to please...

14:18.691 --> 14:19.592
She's black.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.460
Dad, please!

14:21.460 --> 14:23.729
You know damn well that's what
this whole thing's about.

14:23.729 --> 14:25.030
I don't know
what the big deal is.

14:25.030 --> 14:25.998
If she's talking too much,

14:25.998 --> 14:28.367
just tell her
to shut her big bazoo.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.735
Oh, really, and how do you
suggest I accomplish that

14:29.735 --> 14:31.136
without sounding like
a complete bigot?

14:31.136 --> 14:33.038
Well, perhaps a little
diplomacy is in order.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.040
Oh, are you saying
I should just choose my words

14:35.040 --> 14:36.542
more carefully, is that it?
Yeah, exactly.

14:37.042 --> 14:37.977
Oh, fine, fine.

14:37.977 --> 14:39.879
All right, Niles,
just exactly how would that go?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.680
Why don't you play me
and I'll be Mary?

14:41.680 --> 14:43.649
All right, uh, Mary...

14:43.649 --> 14:45.985
Frasier.

14:47.753 --> 14:49.788
I-I've been meaning
to speak to you.

14:49.788 --> 14:52.258
Uh, you know, people listen
to the show for my expertise.

14:52.258 --> 14:55.027
Oh, so, my opinion's
not worth anything?

14:55.027 --> 14:56.795
Well, I'm the one
with the medical degree.

14:56.795 --> 14:58.297
All right, now,
I want you to contribute

14:58.297 --> 14:59.565
but only up to a point.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.334
So you want me to stay
in my place... massa.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.175
She's not going to say "massa."

15:10.175 --> 15:12.645
What, am I getting too uppity
for you... you sherry-swillin',

15:12.645 --> 15:14.647
opera-lovin',
Armani-wearin' elitist.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.615
You have no idea
how difficult it is

15:16.615 --> 15:20.552
for a black woman
in a white man's world.

15:23.289 --> 15:24.056
Frasier...

15:24.056 --> 15:25.491
I don't think so!

15:28.627 --> 15:30.396
Look at me.
This is ridiculous.

15:30.396 --> 15:33.732
I have walked myself
straight into a minefield!

15:33.732 --> 15:36.068
Listen, Frasier,

15:36.068 --> 15:38.037
I know you're trying
to be sensitive,

15:38.037 --> 15:40.072
but you're not showing
this woman any respect

15:40.072 --> 15:41.573
if you're not
as honest with her

15:41.573 --> 15:43.075
as you would be
with someone else.

15:43.075 --> 15:44.543
Right.
This is your show.

15:44.543 --> 15:46.045
When she gets her own show,

15:46.045 --> 15:47.479
she can say
whatever she wants.

15:49.915 --> 15:50.849
Wait a minute.

15:50.849 --> 15:51.884
You know what, Dad?

15:51.884 --> 15:53.419
You may be on to something,
there.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.854
Gosh, I don't know why
I didn't think of that myself.

15:55.854 --> 15:57.356
You know what?
I'm just gonna call Kenny

15:57.356 --> 15:58.357
and tell him to give her
her own show.

15:58.357 --> 15:59.858
They're looking
for a replacement

15:59.858 --> 16:01.160
for Let's Go Camping
with Dan and Jenna.

16:01.160 --> 16:01.961
What happened to them?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.862
They don't know.

16:03.862 --> 16:06.098
Kenny, it's Frasier.

16:06.098 --> 16:07.366
Listen, I've been thinking.

16:07.366 --> 16:08.367
You know what?

16:08.367 --> 16:09.868
I-I think I'm holding Mary back.

16:09.868 --> 16:12.171
Yes, I mean, you know,
a talent like hers

16:12.171 --> 16:14.239
should not be stuck
in a producer's chair.

16:14.239 --> 16:16.575
He agrees with me.

16:16.575 --> 16:18.577
Oh, I'll tell you
what you do.

16:18.577 --> 16:19.578
You snap out of it.

16:19.578 --> 16:21.947
You know why you're afraid
to get married?

16:21.947 --> 16:24.783
You think there's some roomful
of hootchie-mamas out there

16:24.783 --> 16:26.318
just waiting for you

16:26.318 --> 16:27.319
in case you don't want
to do the right thing.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.320
Let me tell you something,

16:28.787 --> 16:30.322
the only thing
you're missing out on is

16:30.322 --> 16:31.824
a lot of cold
and lonely nights,

16:31.824 --> 16:33.826
and I tell you what,
there's not one person out there

16:33.826 --> 16:35.594
that will disagree with me
on that.

16:35.594 --> 16:37.396
I do.

16:40.265 --> 16:42.101
I don't think he deserves
that girl,

16:42.101 --> 16:44.603
and if he's not man enough
to take that leap of faith,

16:44.603 --> 16:46.472
then she's better off
without him.

16:46.472 --> 16:47.806
Louise,
is you trippin'?

16:47.806 --> 16:50.109
"Trippin'"? Girl, they've
been together for 14 years.

16:50.109 --> 16:51.443
They got four kids.

16:51.443 --> 16:53.445
You got to get married.
(Louise arguing)

16:53.445 --> 16:54.947
He needs
to do the right thing.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.448
What are you trying
to tell that man?

16:56.915 --> 16:58.217
You ain't
never been married.

16:58.217 --> 16:59.985
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Hello, I'm Dr. Mary.

17:00.419 --> 17:01.920
Hello. I'm not trying to hear you.
I don't see a Dr. Louise...

17:07.259 --> 17:08.827
Hello.

17:08.827 --> 17:09.828
(grunts)

17:09.828 --> 17:10.829
Hi, Roz.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.330
Hey, Frasier.

17:12.330 --> 17:14.833
Listened to your show for
about 20 minutes today.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.234
I didn't even
hear your voice.

17:16.234 --> 17:19.438
Well, I'm playing
a diminished role these days,

17:19.438 --> 17:21.173
although, still,
an important one.

17:21.173 --> 17:25.544
I am the glue
that... holds the show together,

17:25.544 --> 17:28.047
or as Mary said in her intro...

17:28.547 --> 17:31.550
"The filling
in our little Oreo."

17:33.986 --> 17:37.756
Well, it's no picnic
working with Gil, either.

17:37.756 --> 17:39.591
You know that little joke
he makes before every show

17:39.591 --> 17:41.593
that his taste buds are insured?

17:41.593 --> 17:42.461
Mmm.
They really are.

17:42.461 --> 17:44.229
Oh.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.098
Guess who had
to take the claims photo

17:46.098 --> 17:47.966
after he ate a hot slice
of pizza?

17:47.966 --> 17:49.268
Oh... God, Roz,

17:49.268 --> 17:50.269
I'm so sorry.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.770
You should be.

17:51.770 --> 17:53.772
Go away for a week and you
give away our whole show.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.074
Yes, I know...

17:55.074 --> 17:56.708
Oh, Lord,
there she is.

17:56.708 --> 17:59.144
You know what? I could've nipped
this whole thing in the bud

17:59.144 --> 18:01.613
if I'd just been honest with her
from the beginning.

18:01.613 --> 18:03.115
You know what?

18:03.115 --> 18:05.584
Perhaps the time has come for me
to just tell her the truth.

18:05.584 --> 18:08.087
Well... sounds like an
intense conversation.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.588
Think I'll get
out of here

18:09.588 --> 18:11.056
and give you
a little room.

18:11.056 --> 18:12.024
Thank you, Roz.

18:13.459 --> 18:14.460
Roz...

18:16.228 --> 18:18.530
MARY:
Hey there, partner.

18:18.530 --> 18:21.033
Is there room for one more
at the doctors' table?

18:21.033 --> 18:22.534
(chuckling):
Of course, Mary.

18:22.534 --> 18:25.537
Listen, th-there's something
I-I want to talk to you about.

18:25.537 --> 18:26.872
Oh, I don't
doubt it. Uh...

18:26.872 --> 18:28.173
Could you believe
Louise today?

18:28.173 --> 18:30.442
She just would not stop
talking, would she?

18:30.442 --> 18:32.678
Well, it's not Louise...
Every time I turned around,

18:32.678 --> 18:34.613
she was just yappity-
yappity-yappity-yap.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.148
I mean, what is her
training anyway?

18:36.148 --> 18:38.150
Mary, please, just stop it,
stop it, please.

18:38.150 --> 18:41.620
The problem is not with Louise.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.489
It's with you.

18:43.489 --> 18:45.290
What?

18:45.290 --> 18:49.595
Look, the truth is I...
I don't enjoy working with you.

18:49.595 --> 18:52.798
I haven't enjoyed working
with you from the start.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.199
We have different styles,

18:54.199 --> 18:56.201
and I-I have
absolutely no respect

18:56.201 --> 18:57.703
for the advice
that you give.

18:57.703 --> 19:00.706
I-I had no idea.

19:00.706 --> 19:04.209
Well, why didn't you just
say something before?

19:06.211 --> 19:09.114
Well, it's because you're black.

19:10.516 --> 19:11.483
And...

19:11.483 --> 19:13.986
the truth is I-I'm...
I was afraid that if I...

19:13.986 --> 19:15.487
if I said something
critical of you,

19:15.487 --> 19:18.490
you... you might react
the wrong way,

19:18.490 --> 19:21.860
and... I feel just terrible
about it.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.730
Well, maybe you shouldn't
feel so bad, be...

19:24.730 --> 19:26.598
No, no, actually,
I should.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.433
You see, I pride myself
in being able to communicate

19:28.433 --> 19:29.434
with just about anybody,

19:29.434 --> 19:30.836
and I couldn't even
be honest with you.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.237
Oh, it's not that easy.

19:32.237 --> 19:33.739
You didn't want
to disappoint me.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.073
I understand.

19:35.073 --> 19:36.408
If you don't like the show

19:36.408 --> 19:39.178
the way it is right now
then that comes first.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.947
Like Grandpa Willie
used to say

19:41.947 --> 19:46.385
"If the shoe don't fit,
then that ain't your shoe."

19:46.385 --> 19:50.289
You know, as much as I've come
to loathe Grandpa Willie,

19:50.289 --> 19:52.257
that does actually
make me feel a little better.

19:52.257 --> 19:53.725
(chuckles)

19:53.725 --> 19:56.228
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

19:56.228 --> 19:59.531
All those expressions...
I made them up myself.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.166
(laughing)

20:01.166 --> 20:03.135
I'll give you
another reason

20:03.135 --> 20:05.437
not to feel so bad
about all this.

20:05.437 --> 20:08.273
Today, KPXY offered me
my own show.

20:08.273 --> 20:10.275
I'm going to be just fine
on my own.

20:10.275 --> 20:12.544
Mary, th-that's
wonderful news.

20:12.544 --> 20:16.248
So, you...
you forgive me?

20:16.248 --> 20:19.585
Well, I think you could've
been honest with me.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.853
Then again, if you
told me to be quiet,

20:21.853 --> 20:23.689
then I'd be back
at the bakery.

20:23.689 --> 20:26.191
Instead, I've got
this brand-new career,

20:26.191 --> 20:28.594
and this afternoon,
I'm shopping for cars.

20:28.594 --> 20:30.929
So, I guess what
I'm saying is...

20:30.929 --> 20:33.832
God bless your guilty
white ass, okay?

20:33.832 --> 20:34.800
(laughing)

20:41.273 --> 20:42.207
So...

20:42.207 --> 20:44.076
How'd it go?
Well, actually, uh...

20:44.076 --> 20:45.544
better than I expected.

20:45.544 --> 20:46.545
(chuckles)

20:46.545 --> 20:48.013
I guess
we're a team again, Roz.

20:48.013 --> 20:49.982
Great. We'll have to
wait a little while.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.483
I mean, I got to
stay with Gil

20:51.483 --> 20:53.285
at least until we
find a replacement.

20:53.285 --> 20:54.620
Oh, right, of course.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.622
Well, I-I can
find somebody.

20:57.789 --> 21:00.359
Thank you for your call, Jill.

21:00.359 --> 21:03.295
Well, Chuck,
who else is on the line?

21:03.295 --> 21:05.230
Weww, Dr. Cwane...

21:05.230 --> 21:08.233
we have Winda
on wine fwee

21:08.233 --> 21:12.471
who bewieves peopew
awe waffing at hew.

21:17.075 --> 21:20.412
Maybe we can just come
back to that one, Chuck.

21:20.412 --> 21:21.413
