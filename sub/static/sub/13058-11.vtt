00:00.668 --> 00:05.070
Hello, Dr. Bowman.
It's good to see you again.

00:05.072 --> 00:07.706
I've been waiting
to ask you stuff all week.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.408
That's why I'm here,
Dwight --

00:09.410 --> 00:11.010
to answer
your questions.

00:11.012 --> 00:14.113
We've turned the tables
a little, haven't we?

00:14.115 --> 00:16.115
I wonder
if I'm about to learn

00:16.117 --> 00:18.484
as much about your life
as you did about mine.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.419
Rosen:
Your honor, I object.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.755
The defendant
cannot treat the witness

00:22.757 --> 00:24.423
as if he were at an appointment
with his therapist.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.025
Richwood: Yes.

00:26.027 --> 00:26.725
Mr. Darnell?

00:26.727 --> 00:28.460
Dr. Bowman is present

00:28.462 --> 00:31.230
to speak in his capacity
as a psychologist.

00:31.232 --> 00:34.099
More specifically, to render
his analysis of my mental --

00:34.101 --> 00:35.667
Objection sustained.

00:35.669 --> 00:39.204
Mr. Darnell, since you insist
as acting as your own attorney,

00:39.206 --> 00:41.407
I continue
to give you leeway,

00:41.409 --> 00:44.343
but once again,
I urge you to consult

00:44.345 --> 00:45.978
with your court-appointed
attorney for advice.

00:45.980 --> 00:47.312
He's right there.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.381
Taylor: If he
gives the game away here,

00:49.383 --> 00:53.085
maybe he'll be arrogant enough
to answer some questions

00:53.087 --> 00:56.021
about his Nazi friends
when court adjourns.

00:56.023 --> 00:58.524
Tell us who
his Aryan shot-caller is.

00:58.526 --> 01:01.493
During their investigation,
the Pasadena police --

01:01.495 --> 01:04.897
they asked
for Dr. Bowman's services

01:04.899 --> 01:09.601
in order that "through analyzing
the methodology

01:09.603 --> 01:12.404
and potential motives
of these homicides

01:12.406 --> 01:16.175
to locate and/or identify
a suspect."

01:16.177 --> 01:17.776
Is this
an accurate description

01:17.778 --> 01:19.478
of the job that you were asked
to perform, Dr. Bowman?

01:19.480 --> 01:22.748
In brief, yes.
Huh.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.617
So, before we met
at the behest of detectives,

01:25.619 --> 01:28.153
you had compiled
an imaginary portrait

01:28.155 --> 01:30.122
of my -- my --
my upbringing?

01:30.124 --> 01:31.356
My character?

01:31.358 --> 01:34.326
I speculated
on your personality.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.994
By lumping me in
with a lot of other people?

01:35.996 --> 01:38.497
Not a lot of other<i> people,</i>
Dwight.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.666
A lot
of other<i> murderers.</i>

01:41.802 --> 01:46.038
It is my understanding that
the word "murder" or "homicide"

01:46.040 --> 01:48.707
is reserved
for the unlawful killing

01:48.709 --> 01:50.142
of other human beings.

01:50.144 --> 01:53.612
My so-called victims
were either involved with

01:53.614 --> 01:56.815
or already were part of
an inferior race,

01:56.817 --> 01:59.618
and therefore,
it is my defense --
Objection!

01:59.620 --> 02:02.321
The 6 adults
and 2 children under 10

02:02.323 --> 02:04.223

by the defendant

02:04.225 --> 02:06.658
were human
in every sense of the word.

02:06.660 --> 02:07.860
Richwood: Sustained.

02:07.862 --> 02:09.895
Claiming your victims
were unworthy of life

02:09.897 --> 02:12.631
because they were minorities
is not a defense, Mr. Darnell.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.433
Make your point,
if you have one.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.501
I do.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.970
Dr. Bowman,
am I correct in stating

02:17.972 --> 02:20.639
that on July 16th
of last year,

02:20.641 --> 02:22.541
you predicted
that I would be

02:22.543 --> 02:24.643
at one of 12 addresses
in Pasadena

02:24.645 --> 02:27.980

to execute a married couple

02:27.982 --> 02:32.284

the purity of the white race?

and some potential targets

your arrest if that's --

So, I stand here today
on trial for my life,

02:40.628 --> 02:44.396
partly because
you took my individual nature

02:44.398 --> 02:47.733
and reduced it
to a pattern?

02:47.735 --> 02:52.671
You shrunk it down
to fit a generic profile?

That's one way
of looking at it.

could I look at it, Doctor?
