WEBVTT

00:04.129 --> 00:06.882
-It's all set, ready to go.
-Hold on. Wait for me.

00:06.965 --> 00:08.592
Is Guy Fieri in the greenroom?

00:08.675 --> 00:11.053
-Grab him. Don't let him go.
-Got it. Straight to rerun or…

00:11.136 --> 00:13.055
-I wanted to hear from upstairs.
-Go to The Twist!

00:13.138 --> 00:16.642
Alex, what you did is amazing
but we need to deal with this. Let us in.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.644
-Twitter's going fucking nuts.
-Oh, God.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.604
Does the room feel like
it's turning white?

00:20.687 --> 00:22.189
-Alex. Alex.
-Oh, gosh.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.690
Just one second, please!

00:23.774 --> 00:25.359
-Open up.
-Those UBA fuckers,

00:25.442 --> 00:27.194
they're going to fight
to keep their credibility,

00:27.277 --> 00:29.613
and that means some version
of dragging us through the mud.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.573
Fred has to go.
They have to understand that.

00:31.657 --> 00:32.658
We crossed a line,

00:32.741 --> 00:35.619
and they're not gonna do
what we want them to do because of that.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.412
Alex, everything is gonna be fine.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.206
-We love you.
-Okay. Okay! Okay!

00:39.289 --> 00:41.500
-I have to let them in.
-Okay. I understand.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.836
-Listen. I--
-Wait, wait, wait. Before you do,

00:43.919 --> 00:45.546
we have to stay together on this.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.673
And whatever you do,
don't mention Hannah by name.

00:47.756 --> 00:48.757
She didn't want that.

00:49.758 --> 00:50.926
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.637
-Alex, I will break down the door--
-Okay, okay, okay.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.138
Oh, my God. Thank God.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.975
-How are you?
-Oh, my God. I just needed a second.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.226
-Amazing what you did.
-We're fine.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.229
-Where's the phone? Where's the phone?
-Where's the phone? Get the phone.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.897
Let's not say anything to anybody.

01:03.981 --> 01:06.066
-I'm not talking.
-Open our mouths, we weaken our position.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.193
-Left, left.
-So we're gonna keep our mouths shut.

01:08.277 --> 01:09.319
Alex!

01:09.403 --> 01:10.571
Wait, Brad.

01:10.654 --> 01:13.824
Just keep your phone on
and near you, okay?

01:13.907 --> 01:16.535
-I'll-- I'll call you.
-Yeah, no, I'll take care of it. Come on.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.579
-Give me my jacket.
-Hold the elevator doors. Jim--

01:18.662 --> 01:20.122
Hold the doors.

01:28.922 --> 01:29.923
You're a dead man.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.508
Said the corpse.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.762
No. Wait…

01:38.891 --> 01:39.892
You're firing me?

01:39.975 --> 01:41.685
You put Fred Micklen
on administrative leave,

01:41.768 --> 01:42.769
and you're firing me?

01:42.853 --> 01:45.772
Did you not hear what was said
on our airwaves this morning?

01:46.356 --> 01:48.650
We heard. Loud and clear.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.320
What, do you not believe the victim?

01:51.403 --> 01:53.280
Or do you just not care?

01:53.363 --> 01:55.157
'Course we believe the victim.

01:55.240 --> 01:59.036
We believe all victims,
every last one of them,

01:59.119 --> 02:01.622
forever and ever until the end of time.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.874
And if we are proven correct
in that belief,

02:03.957 --> 02:05.584
Fred will be terminated as well.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.544
But none of us were in those rooms,

02:07.628 --> 02:09.794
none of us can say
with any certainty at this moment

02:09.880 --> 02:11.798
what happened, except for Fred.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.842
That's because the other person,
Hannah Shoenfeld,

02:13.926 --> 02:15.886
-died this morning.
-E-- Except for Fred.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.598
Who steadfastly maintains his innocence.

02:19.681 --> 02:22.226
If we find evidence
that any of that was true,

02:22.309 --> 02:24.102
we will extend zero tolerance.

02:24.186 --> 02:27.397
Okay, well, that's horseshit, but okay.

02:27.481 --> 02:31.235
Well, you can't terminate my contract
without just cause,

02:31.318 --> 02:33.570
and all I did was give the truth
some oxygen.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.448
The truth? Look, here's the truth.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.785
We suspect Fred might not be innocent,

02:39.868 --> 02:43.956
but we know you're guilty
of taking over UBA's airwaves,

02:44.039 --> 02:48.043
of allowing wild allegations to be made
against the CEO of the network,

02:48.126 --> 02:51.880
and of physically locking him out
of his own control room.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.843
Which, by the way,
is also a serious fire hazard.

02:58.178 --> 03:01.056
The fire hazard.

03:01.139 --> 03:05.310
That was pirate television,
and it has no place on our network.

03:05.394 --> 03:08.522
This really is the land that time forgot.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.940
All right. Well, I did my best,

03:10.023 --> 03:13.986
but I cannot drag you idiots kicking
and screaming into the 21st century.

03:14.069 --> 03:17.489
You're just so caught up in ruling
over your rotten little fiefdom

03:17.573 --> 03:20.701
that you don't even see the world
that has sprouted up all around you.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.954
All right. Well,
enjoy broadcasting your cave paintings

03:24.037 --> 03:27.040
to the last remaining savages who are
still watching over-the-air broadcasting.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.125
The rest of the world,

03:28.208 --> 03:31.587
they've moved to the cloud,
and it is fucking gorgeous up there.

03:32.588 --> 03:33.964
Cory, if you'll excuse us,

03:34.047 --> 03:36.216
we have a television network
we need to fix.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.135
Well, get out that superglue.

03:39.595 --> 03:41.638
Do you really think
that's what all this is about?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.390
Your little television network?

03:44.641 --> 03:48.979
This is a battle
for the soul of the universe.

07:21.733 --> 07:25.445
Maybe it's much too early in the game

07:26.029 --> 07:30.117
Oh, but I thought
I'd ask you just the same

07:30.200 --> 07:33.662
What are you doing New Year's

07:35.080 --> 07:37.541
New Year's Eve?

07:39.084 --> 07:41.211
Great move. Widen out.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.422
And you didn't think we'd get her to sing.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.925
Eric talked her into it.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.846
Welcoming in the New Year

07:51.346 --> 07:53.807
Standby, camera two.
Take it, camera two.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.392
Keep it fun, Bradley.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.563
-Maybe I'm crazy to suppose
-Camera two, zoom on Bradley. Take it.

08:00.230 --> 08:04.193
I'd ever be the one you chose

08:04.276 --> 08:08.071
Out of a thousand invitations

08:08.155 --> 08:11.575
You'll receive

08:11.658 --> 08:14.870
Did you know that this is actually about
making New Year's Eve plans way too early?

08:14.953 --> 08:16.622
All I know is we're gonna
freeze our balls off

08:16.705 --> 08:19.291
-tomorrow night in Times Square.
-…stand one little chance

08:19.374 --> 08:22.794
Here comes the jackpot question
In advance

08:22.878 --> 08:23.879
Yes, we are.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.507
What are you doing New Year's

08:26.590 --> 08:28.175
Oh, shit.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.845
-Beautiful. Four.
-New Year's Eve?

08:32.721 --> 08:35.224
Two, ready? Take it, two.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.392
Yeah, I just saw.

08:37.476 --> 08:39.561
Another one bites the dust.

08:39.645 --> 08:42.981
Multiple current and former employees
have come forward

08:43.065 --> 08:44.900
with allegations of emotional abuse

08:44.983 --> 08:46.610
and are calling for the public to…

08:46.693 --> 08:50.239
Times asking for a comment on one,
Maggie Brener on three, said she'd hold.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.823
Media Relations left a word.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.867
They need to know
what they're saying about Ray.

08:53.951 --> 08:57.120
Is he still on a scheduled vacation,
or can we announce anything?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.539
And what's the board doing?

08:58.622 --> 09:02.042
Emergency meeting to discuss Ray's
replacement for the evening news chair.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.126
Call back the Times,

09:03.210 --> 09:05.128
give me Maggie Brener first
and assemble the team,

09:05.212 --> 09:07.464
Mia Jordan, Stella Bak, Vince Fontana,
Legal, ASAP.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.049
Additionally,
one of Marcus's former assistants…

09:09.132 --> 09:10.342
-Is she on?
-She's on.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.386
…that when she requested time off
to attend

09:12.469 --> 09:14.263
-her mother-in-law's funeral, Marcus…
-Maggie,

09:14.346 --> 09:16.807
I hope we gave you enough time
to include this in your book.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.853
What are you doing New Year's?

09:20.936 --> 09:26.233
What are you doing New Year's Eve?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.533
All right, don't forget,

09:34.616 --> 09:38.370
Bradley and I will be hosting
UBA's New Year's Eve Extravaganza

09:38.453 --> 09:41.164
tomorrow night live from Times Square.

09:41.248 --> 09:46.003
Andrew W.K., Drake, Lauren Alaina,
actual musical guests.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.298
-No singing from us, thank goodness.
-Hey, come on, I saw you having fun.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.966
Is that what fun looks like to you?

09:51.049 --> 09:53.218
Well, it looks like
what you'll be seeing here on UBA

09:53.302 --> 09:54.887
-starting at 8:00 p.m. eastern…
-That's right.

09:54.970 --> 09:55.888
…tomorrow night.

09:55.971 --> 10:00.392
-We hope you can ring in 2020 with us.
-Eric and I will be looking for you.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.311
Now stay tuned for The Twist.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.813
And we're out. Good job, you guys.

10:07.608 --> 10:08.609
Twitter's loving it.

10:08.692 --> 10:09.776
-Really?
-I told you.

10:09.860 --> 10:12.321
All right, it was more fun than I thought.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.405
Oh, Jesus.

10:13.488 --> 10:14.823
Did you see this about Ray?

10:14.907 --> 10:17.659
-Emotionally abusing his staff?
-What?

10:18.660 --> 10:20.495
-God.
-No.

10:22.831 --> 10:23.832
Gayle.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.251
I pushed the issue, all right?

10:26.335 --> 10:27.920
This is coming from Mia?

10:28.003 --> 10:30.130
Mia wants to do
"Nutrition in the New Year"?

10:30.214 --> 10:32.758
Well, I think it has less to do
with "Nutrition in the New Year"

10:32.841 --> 10:36.136
and more to do with, you know,
bumming everybody the fuck out.

10:36.220 --> 10:39.556
New Year's Eve and New Year's Day
are two of the deadliest days of the year.

10:39.640 --> 10:44.061
Alcohol consumption goes up,
drug use rises, people die.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.188
It's a fact. I'm sorry it's a bummer.

10:47.439 --> 10:53.654
Okay, I was trying to give it to you easy,
but we weren't given an option.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.490
I'm gonna go talk to her.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.741
Bradley.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.285
Ratings are down. Pick your battles.

11:00.369 --> 11:02.162
You know,
if they don't value me around here,

11:02.246 --> 11:05.374
I have a feeling there's gonna be
an opening on the evening news very soon.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.334
That seems like a safe bet.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.544
And I seriously doubt

11:08.627 --> 11:10.921
Vince would tell me to do
"Nutrition in the New Year"

11:11.004 --> 11:12.297
on the evening news.

11:14.049 --> 11:15.509
And by the way, Gayle,

11:15.592 --> 11:18.387
you told me all this singing
and dancing and playing along

11:18.470 --> 11:20.681
was gonna buy me
some freedom around this place.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.767
I mean, I dyed my hair,
I hosted their celebrity bowling show,

11:23.851 --> 11:27.437
I-- I did stupid TikTok dances on TV.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.691
I did everything short of tattooing UBA
on my ass, and for what?

11:30.774 --> 11:33.819
You've gotten to do
most of the stories you wanted to do.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.364
If we stay the course,
people will catch up.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.408
I hope you're right.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.412
I'm gonna talk to Cory
about the evening news.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.956
-He values integrity.
-We need to get out ahead of this.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.708
Bradley Jackson isn't gonna
find out on Twitter

11:47.791 --> 11:49.376
that we're poaching her partner
for evening news.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.003
When are we ready
to make the switch with Eric?

11:51.086 --> 11:53.547
-He's ready to close, almost.
-Well, close the deal.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.883
We were supposed to have time
to ease her into this idea.

11:55.966 --> 11:59.928
You know, this is making my life difficult
to fire him, so maybe we don't.

12:00.012 --> 12:03.724
Yelling at a PA isn't exactly
the same thing as sexual assault.

12:03.807 --> 12:07.936
I had a boss throw a pineapple at my head
when I was a PA, and here I am.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.981
We've heard that story before, Vince.
This network needs to clean up its act.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.399
Let me make this simple.

12:12.482 --> 12:16.278
The press release announcing Ray's firing
and Eric's move to evening news

12:16.361 --> 12:17.237
is being drafted now,

12:17.321 --> 12:19.031
but we're not gonna release it
till everything else is in place.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.282
The timetable has changed

12:20.365 --> 12:22.951
now that somebody has decided
to leak the information to the press,

12:23.035 --> 12:24.995
so we have to move expeditiously.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.040
Let's just concentrate
on who we're pairing with Bradley.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.292
Stellar. Our short list is down to Mickey
and Aaron.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.170
-What the fuck happened to Miguel?
-He declined.

12:34.046 --> 12:35.714
He-- He declined The Morning Show?

12:35.797 --> 12:37.841
He wasn't excited
about working with Bradley.

12:42.429 --> 12:46.266
Listen, what about keeping Eric on TMS,
moving Bradley to evening?

12:47.100 --> 12:50.062
You know she loves her news hard.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.814
Okay, should we have the conversation
about Bradley

12:52.898 --> 12:54.399
-that I think we're all thinking?
-What?

12:54.483 --> 12:55.817
Is she really cutting it?

12:57.402 --> 12:59.363
That seems extreme.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.157
Ratings have been down.
Her contract is up in a few months.

13:02.241 --> 13:05.035
Yeah, Bradley was poised to become
some sort of feminist superhero,

13:05.118 --> 13:06.328
but she couldn't capitalize.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.163
No, wait. She refused to capitalize.

13:08.247 --> 13:11.041
Well, I kind of admire that she didn't
just jump on the Me Too bandwagon

13:11.124 --> 13:13.752
and fill up her grocery cart
with free prizes and fake goodwill.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.838
Yeah, but she went out of her way
not to fill up her cart.

13:15.921 --> 13:17.631
She called that women's club out
on the carpet--

13:17.714 --> 13:18.882
For underpaying staff.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.300
Listen, you know I love Bradley,

13:20.384 --> 13:24.555
but she really needs the poise and polish
and gravity of a seasoned anchor like Alex

13:24.638 --> 13:25.639
to balance her out.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.852
-Fine.
-Okay then,

13:29.935 --> 13:31.728
we have a list of potential
partner combinations

13:31.812 --> 13:34.356
-that are ready to go--
-What? No, I said fine. Fine, fine.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.441
-"Fine," what?
-We get Alex back.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.610
-No, no. I didn't-- I didn't mean--
-What? No.

13:38.694 --> 13:41.113
-I don't think that's an option.
-Why, have you talked to her?

13:41.196 --> 13:43.824
She publicly left the show.
It was a big deal.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.200
Did she personally tell you no?

13:45.284 --> 13:46.743
Yes, emphatically,

13:46.827 --> 13:48.704
when she left the show eight months ago.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.914
That's why we went out
and spent all that money on Eric.

13:50.998 --> 13:54.376
But who else is a story like Alex is?

13:54.459 --> 13:55.711
Who else can distract us

13:55.794 --> 13:58.338
from the burning trash barge
that we are currently floating

13:58.422 --> 14:00.299
right down the center of the city? No one.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.718
I don't know that bringing her back is
the event that you think it is.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.219
She's a feminist icon.

14:04.303 --> 14:06.013
Maybe. But I also don't love the idea

14:06.096 --> 14:09.683
that she's another white woman
as co-anchor, feminist icon or not.

14:09.766 --> 14:12.394
And especially one who admitted
to doing a lot of questionable shit.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.855
And personally, I think Alex is done.

14:17.274 --> 14:21.570
The thing people don't realize is
that there is a cost to success and fame.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.615
There's a story
by Hans Christian Andersen.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.994
A young woman becomes enamored
with these fabulous red shoes

14:29.077 --> 14:31.663
that are more attention-grabbing
and exciting

14:31.747 --> 14:33.916
than the humble brown shoes she wears.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.667
In a moment of bad judgment,

14:35.751 --> 14:38.837
she succumbs to their charms
and wears them to church.

14:39.630 --> 14:42.591
And lo and behold, her feet start moving

14:42.674 --> 14:45.761
and she is dancing, and she can't stop.

14:46.428 --> 14:50.390
And she dances
for hours and days and weeks

14:50.474 --> 14:52.643
until she is bloody and bruised

14:52.726 --> 14:56.605
from dancing like a whirling dervish
through the countryside and towns,

14:56.688 --> 14:57.689
unable to stop.

14:58.315 --> 15:02.694
She finally dances so much and so hard,
faster and faster,

15:03.445 --> 15:05.739
that she knows
she is going to bleed to death.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.743
So in a desperate attempt
to stave off death,

15:09.826 --> 15:12.788
she finally implores a woodcutter
to cut off her feet.

15:13.372 --> 15:14.373
And he does.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.250
Then she dies.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.507
Times were different back then.

15:24.383 --> 15:27.427
And I'm sure there's
some patriarchal message in this

15:27.511 --> 15:31.640
to women who wanted
to step out of their role.

15:32.975 --> 15:36.687
However, I always took away
from it as a kid--

15:37.437 --> 15:39.731
and it probably says something
about me as a kid--

15:40.691 --> 15:43.902
is the idea that the world
might have you running so hard

15:45.153 --> 15:49.908
that rather than running one step more,
you would cut off your own feet.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.702
Never…

15:51.785 --> 15:55.205
And I never-- I never forgot that image.

15:56.582 --> 15:59.960
I think success in the modern world
demands a similar dance--

16:00.502 --> 16:03.839
soul-sucking, grueling, never ending.

16:04.506 --> 16:07.092
-Just wanted it to end.
-And I just wanted it to end.

16:07.885 --> 16:10.804
I wanted it to end
so I could begin to live.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.730
I'll let you know how it goes.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.398
Stay tuned for The Twist.

16:22.274 --> 16:24.067
End manuscript.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.863
You want a hundred million a year
to buy back

17:09.945 --> 17:11.906
the streaming rights for Hampton?

17:11.990 --> 17:14.867
Well, Bruce, normally I'd hate
to be the bearer of bad news,

17:14.952 --> 17:16.993
but with you, somehow, I love it.

17:17.079 --> 17:20.457
We're not gonna renew the deal
for Apocalypse 13. How's that?

17:20.540 --> 17:21.583
So if you wanna see it,

17:21.665 --> 17:25.671
you're gonna have to do like everybody
else and subscribe to UBA Plus.

17:25.752 --> 17:28.298
And don't worry, there's a free trial
if you can't swing the $7.99.

17:28.382 --> 17:31.134
I guess
anger issues are endemic over there.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.804
Nah, this isn't anger.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.265
You'll know when I'm angry.
I'll make sure of that.

17:36.974 --> 17:39.726
-Kyle, who's holding on three?
-That's Ivy. You told me to get her.

17:39.810 --> 17:41.603
No, tell her I'll call her back.
I need Pete Freeman.

17:41.687 --> 17:44.147
Keep rolling through the call sheet.
I need to get outta here soon.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.692
-Hey. Should I come back later?
-Yeah, hi. Sorry…

17:46.775 --> 17:48.443
Hi. No, no.

17:48.527 --> 17:51.280
-Pete Freeman on two.
-Tell him I'll call him back.

17:51.363 --> 17:55.576
-Look what the cat dragged in. Hi.
-Hey.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.077
Been a while.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.662
-Yeah, I've been a little busy.
-Yeah.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.622
-Can-- Can you talk for a second?
-Yeah.

18:00.706 --> 18:01.832
-Oh, great.
-Yeah.

18:03.292 --> 18:04.293
Thanks.

18:05.169 --> 18:07.087
What a morning.

18:08.881 --> 18:10.799
Are you gonna have to fire Ray?

18:10.883 --> 18:13.802
Well, I mean,
I can't tell you that, but yes.

18:13.886 --> 18:18.056
So, who are you gonna get to replace him?

18:18.140 --> 18:21.268
Yeah, I--

18:23.103 --> 18:25.355
I don't-- I don't know.

18:25.439 --> 18:27.941
In fact, if you find out,
please tell me

18:28.025 --> 18:29.401
because I'm dying to know.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.612
-Well, you would be my first call.
-I appreciate it.

18:32.237 --> 18:36.325
And if you can't find anybody good,
there's always me.

18:36.408 --> 18:39.453
Well, I thank you for that selfless offer.

18:40.746 --> 18:42.581
Okay, you owe me, buddy.

18:42.664 --> 18:46.710
Remember you were fired around here,
don't forget. And I got you un-fired.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.253
I-- Yep.

18:48.754 --> 18:52.299
-And obviously, I-- I thank you for that.
-I'd do it again.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.801
I really need you on The Morning Show.
I need that stability.

18:54.885 --> 18:57.638
When people turn on The Morning Show,
they're gonna see Bradley Jackson.

18:57.721 --> 19:01.183
And by the way,
you have been killing it this week.

19:01.266 --> 19:04.102
-Just this week? I mean…
-Oh. Don't do that to me.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.647
No, I-- Look, I get it,

19:06.730 --> 19:10.609
and I know that the ratings have gone down
a little bit since Alex left,

19:10.692 --> 19:12.444
and I'm not oblivious,

19:12.528 --> 19:15.113
I just think evening news,

19:15.197 --> 19:17.824
it just might be
a better fit for my talents.

19:17.908 --> 19:22.079
And Ray leaving creates this square hole
that's perfect for a square peg.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.706
And I know-- I know that I would kill it.

19:24.790 --> 19:27.042
Oh, abso-- Of course you would.
What are you talking about?

19:27.125 --> 19:28.961
You would absolutely crush that.

19:29.044 --> 19:32.756
But, you know, my problem is I like to fit
square pegs into round holes

19:32.840 --> 19:34.508
'cause it's really hard,

19:34.591 --> 19:37.219
but when you can make it fit,
like, perfectly, actually make it fit,

19:37.302 --> 19:38.971
it's magical. It's totally magical.

19:39.054 --> 19:42.891
Feels like magic. And not
like magic tricks, like actual sorcery.

19:42.975 --> 19:45.936
And of course, of course the ratings
took a dip there for a while,

19:46.019 --> 19:49.523
but that's what's gonna make
the ta-da moment so exhilarating.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.650
So I can't move you before the ta-da.

19:57.281 --> 19:58.282
Okay.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.616
Okay.

19:59.700 --> 20:02.703
Well, you know, and I kinda feel like
I've been finding my groove on the show.

20:02.786 --> 20:04.121
-Yeah.
-And Eric,

20:04.204 --> 20:06.039
he and I just complement each other
really well.

20:06.123 --> 20:08.333
Well, that's you,
you complement anyone well.

20:08.417 --> 20:09.418
I don't know about that.

20:09.501 --> 20:12.880
I mean, I think he and I are a good match.
It's much better than the last situation.

20:12.963 --> 20:15.591
Oh, come on, you and Alex,
you had something special too.

20:15.674 --> 20:17.634
For five minutes.

20:17.718 --> 20:21.513
I mean, that's the most I ever felt like
we had a relationship.

20:21.597 --> 20:25.475
But, I mean, she left, and I--
I haven't even heard from her.

20:25.559 --> 20:26.977
Well, yeah.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.979
It was a hell of a five minutes.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.940
And who knows what would've happened
if you'd had a chance to build on 'em.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.736
That's true.
I guess we'll never know.

20:35.819 --> 20:37.404
Anyway, it's better this way.

20:37.487 --> 20:40.199
Well, I have learned never to say never.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.992
Except when I'm saying never to say never,

20:42.075 --> 20:44.036
in which case
I say it twice in one sentence.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.788
I miss you.

20:50.250 --> 20:55.380
Yeah, you know,
we got busy, a lot happened.

20:55.464 --> 20:58.050
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah.

20:58.717 --> 21:00.427
It feels like
that was a million years ago.

21:01.470 --> 21:03.096
And yet it was still 2019.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.681
Yeah, tell me about it.

21:07.017 --> 21:11.313
And the Hannah stuff has,
you know, been hard and on my mind.

21:12.689 --> 21:13.899
I--

21:15.526 --> 21:17.611
That stuff, I guess it just takes time.

21:20.030 --> 21:22.866
But we'll get there.
We will. We'll get there.

21:23.825 --> 21:26.161
Hi, this is Shirlee Alpert,
from Horseheads.

21:26.245 --> 21:29.706
I want to nominate my grandson,
Zack, for Hero of the Day.

21:29.790 --> 21:33.460
Yesterday at the park, he and a child
he didn't know were eating candy canes,

21:33.544 --> 21:35.504
until the other child dropped his
on the ground

21:35.587 --> 21:37.589
and started crying like the dickens.

21:37.673 --> 21:41.718
Well, Zack really has the Christmas spirit
in him, we've made sure of that.

21:41.802 --> 21:44.221
And he offered to share his candy cane.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.515
I have got photos of
the two of them licking it.

21:46.598 --> 21:48.559
I just thought it was the sweetest thing,

21:48.642 --> 21:51.061
and maybe you could do a story
about that on the news.

21:51.144 --> 21:55.357
My number is 607-433-2--

21:57.943 --> 21:58.777
It cut off.

21:58.861 --> 22:02.030
I know, we just missed it.
It was right there.

22:02.114 --> 22:03.574
You want me to pursue it?

22:04.241 --> 22:05.534
It's sort of gross.

22:05.617 --> 22:07.077
Two kids licking one candy cane.

22:07.160 --> 22:11.498
Yeah, but you know, kids need germs,
kinda bolster the immune system.

22:11.582 --> 22:13.041
I say you track her down.

22:13.125 --> 22:15.460
It's gonna be six months
before we do another Christmas story.

22:15.544 --> 22:18.422
Actually, that's not true around here,
but you should track her down anyway.

22:25.012 --> 22:27.264
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

22:27.347 --> 22:28.599
-Hi.
-Hi.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.811
I got done at the school
and thought I'd swing by

22:32.895 --> 22:36.356
and see my very successful
producer boyfriend.

22:36.440 --> 22:37.649
Really? Where is he?

22:37.733 --> 22:39.026
-I'll tell him you're here.
-You're funny.

22:39.109 --> 22:41.153
Well, I better be
'cause you're not dating me for my looks.

22:41.862 --> 22:43.405
How we doing on the New Year's plans?

22:43.488 --> 22:45.490
-Are we good?
-Yeah, you think you can get away?

22:45.574 --> 22:50.162
I think so. This place runs itself.

22:50.245 --> 22:52.039
Hey. The phones aren't working.

22:52.706 --> 22:54.791
Have you called the phone company?

22:54.875 --> 22:55.959
The phones are out.

22:56.043 --> 22:57.085
Cell phone?

23:03.300 --> 23:05.511
It doesn't like totally run itself.

23:05.594 --> 23:10.349
But turns out either it doesn't matter,
or I don't care,

23:10.432 --> 23:12.476
-or I just wanna be with you.
-Yeah?

23:12.559 --> 23:13.602
-Yeah.
-Okay.

23:15.771 --> 23:16.772
I'll see you tomorrow then.

23:16.855 --> 23:19.483
-Oh, yeah, you'll see me tomorrow.
-All right. Bye.

23:25.948 --> 23:28.116
Come on, baby. Oh, good boy.

23:39.503 --> 23:40.504
Did you read it already?

23:40.587 --> 23:43.757
I just finished it. It's really good.

23:47.636 --> 23:49.763
So what's not working for you?

23:49.847 --> 23:52.015
Jesus, Alex, I said it's really good.

23:52.099 --> 23:53.100
Yeah, okay, come on.

23:53.183 --> 23:57.437
I know what "really good" means
on feedback, okay?

23:57.521 --> 23:59.314
It means "not great,"
"you didn't like it,"

23:59.398 --> 24:01.191
"not out of the park," what?
Don't bullshit me.

24:01.275 --> 24:03.777
Let's not go off the deep end here, okay?

24:03.861 --> 24:06.280
It's really good. That's not bullshit.

24:06.864 --> 24:09.074
You have lived an amazing life.

24:09.157 --> 24:12.786
You've brushed elbows with some of
the most influential people on the planet.

24:13.412 --> 24:16.582
You've carved out a place
as a woman in that business

24:16.665 --> 24:19.293
that few have even come close to.

24:19.376 --> 24:21.545
You started a UBA revolution.

24:22.379 --> 24:26.341
The events are all amazing.
It's raw, it's real.

24:29.303 --> 24:30.929
S-- So-- So what's wrong?

24:32.139 --> 24:36.852
I just think you need to go back
and dig a little deeper in certain areas.

24:36.935 --> 24:39.438
Oh, my gosh! Come on.

24:40.147 --> 24:41.148
I talked about…

24:42.691 --> 24:45.402
my insecurities and my divorce and--
I mean…

24:46.528 --> 24:47.529
About Mitch.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.162
I'm not interested in talking about Mitch.

24:55.245 --> 24:56.955
People are gonna be buying it for that.

24:57.039 --> 25:00.459
Nothing against you,
but that shit sells books.

25:00.542 --> 25:05.339
And not only that, Alex,
it's an important piece of a movement.

25:05.422 --> 25:07.341
Yeah, I know. I know the fucking movement.

25:08.884 --> 25:11.595
I've destroyed my entire career
over the movement.

25:12.221 --> 25:14.223
Please don't make me go back in there.
Come on.

25:14.306 --> 25:16.099
I'm saying this as a friend, Alex.

25:16.183 --> 25:18.227
We don't know what's gonna be
in Maggie's book.

25:21.438 --> 25:24.107
That sounds like you do know
what's gonna be in Maggie's book.

25:24.191 --> 25:25.025
No, I don't.

25:25.609 --> 25:27.945
I know her editor, but she won't tell me.

25:28.028 --> 25:29.321
But whatever it is,

25:29.404 --> 25:32.491
this gives you the opportunity
to go in there and respond

25:32.574 --> 25:34.159
without looking like you're responding.

25:34.243 --> 25:36.453
-To defend yourself.
-Jesus!

25:36.537 --> 25:38.080
What am I defending myself about

25:38.163 --> 25:40.457
that I didn't already admit
on national television?

25:40.541 --> 25:42.167
Alex, all I'm saying is,

25:42.251 --> 25:47.506
if there is any history with Mitch,
any personal history,

25:47.589 --> 25:50.759
this is your chance
to put your own narrative on it.

25:50.843 --> 25:52.010
Well, there isn't!

25:55.180 --> 25:57.975
I'll go back and look at the manuscript

25:58.058 --> 26:03.480
and see if I can dig up
any salacious bits about Mitch.

26:03.564 --> 26:06.024
Keep the sharks fed.

26:07.901 --> 26:10.279
Just think about what I'm saying,
all right? You'll get there.

26:10.362 --> 26:12.698
Yeah, all right, Adelle. Thanks, bye. Bye.

26:13.866 --> 26:14.867
Fucking Mitch.

26:14.950 --> 26:16.493
Mo-- Mommy, you--

26:16.577 --> 26:18.745
you gotta stop pressing the button,
okay, Mommy?

26:20.956 --> 26:23.542
The ambulance is coming
because you're pressing the button, okay?

26:23.625 --> 26:24.835
It doesn't turn it off.

26:25.669 --> 26:27.880
But it--
Ma, it's not on until you press it.

26:27.963 --> 26:30.257
I promise you,
no one's listening to your conversations

26:30.340 --> 26:32.259
-through your Life Alert, okay?
-Yanko?

26:35.971 --> 26:37.472
Okay, bye, bye.

26:37.556 --> 26:39.766
Oh, my God. So good to see you, Meredith.

26:40.350 --> 26:43.687
Oh, my God.
It's-- It's been a while, yeah.

26:43.770 --> 26:44.771
Yeah.

26:46.607 --> 26:49.610
-Have you heard anything from Claire?
-Yeah.

26:49.693 --> 26:53.530
-She's studying for her GRE.
-Oh, wow. She's bouncing back.

26:53.614 --> 26:55.574
-That's so good to hear that.
-Yeah.

26:55.657 --> 26:58.952
I think it was good for her to get away
after all of that unpleasantness.

26:59.036 --> 27:01.288
Oh, yeah. No doubt. Yeah.

27:03.749 --> 27:06.668
-Well, good seeing you.
-So great seeing you.

27:07.920 --> 27:11.507
When I talk to her next,
I'll tell her that I ran into you.

27:11.590 --> 27:14.176
Sure, sure. Yeah. Take care.

27:15.636 --> 27:18.472
Hey, Yanko. What's the weather, man?

27:19.556 --> 27:22.684
Well the earth's gonna crash
into the sun,

27:22.768 --> 27:24.603
but tomorrow night you'll need
a fucking sweater.

27:28.398 --> 27:29.399
F--

27:36.657 --> 27:38.534
Shit. Oh, God.

27:40.452 --> 27:41.537
Oh.

27:46.875 --> 27:50.087
Chopping wood. Alex. Hello.

27:52.798 --> 27:54.049
Cory Ellison?

27:55.843 --> 27:57.511
What the fuck are you doing in Maine?

27:57.594 --> 27:59.721
Well,
what the fuck are you doing in Maine?

28:00.806 --> 28:03.642
You really do need something, huh?

28:04.142 --> 28:07.271
And I can't imagine that it's anything
that I have to give.

28:07.354 --> 28:09.189
I need you to come back for a year.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.945
Bradley's-- She's doing okay,
but she's not testing great,

28:15.028 --> 28:16.738
and we're taking Eric
for the evening news.

28:18.991 --> 28:19.992
Yeah.

28:21.410 --> 28:22.411
Wow.

28:25.205 --> 28:26.415
Bradley upset?

28:27.958 --> 28:28.959
Well, she will be.

28:29.710 --> 28:30.711
She will be.

28:30.794 --> 28:32.921
God, you know what? Same old UBA.

28:33.005 --> 28:35.382
-You-- You guys.
-Alex, business is business.

28:35.465 --> 28:36.633
Those things don't change.

28:36.717 --> 28:40.095
My job is to ensure the stability of UBA.
I do what I have to do.

28:40.179 --> 28:41.346
Just to be clear,

28:41.430 --> 28:43.182
I'm not talking about coming back
the same as before.

28:43.265 --> 28:46.393
I am talking about a whole new deal.

28:46.476 --> 28:47.936
You partner with the network.

28:48.020 --> 28:50.272
You become a powerful voice
in the rebuilding

28:50.355 --> 28:52.774
and the rebranding
of a-- a toxic empire that--

28:52.858 --> 28:54.026
It-- It's gonna rise.

28:54.109 --> 28:57.404
It's gonna rise from the ashes like--
like Venus out of the clamshell.

28:57.487 --> 28:59.781
And you are Venus.

29:03.744 --> 29:04.870
I need you.

29:05.913 --> 29:08.749
UBA needs you.

29:11.668 --> 29:14.922
You were all we ever needed,
and we were too stupid to realize it.

29:16.215 --> 29:18.884
Please come back to us, Alex.

29:20.469 --> 29:22.429
You are the only thing that can save us.

29:31.980 --> 29:35.067
I agree with every single thing
you just said.

29:35.692 --> 29:37.653
Every single thing you just said.

29:38.362 --> 29:40.447
I j-- I can't come back.

29:40.531 --> 29:43.492
Not e-- Even if I wanted to come back,
I just couldn't.

29:43.575 --> 29:45.994
I-I-- I would look flaky.

29:46.078 --> 29:47.829
-W-Wishy-washy.
-No, no, no, no.

29:47.913 --> 29:50.666
When your new deal got announced,
you would look smart as fuck.

29:57.297 --> 29:58.966
I don't want to.

29:59.049 --> 30:01.718
I don't want to. I'm done. I'm done.

30:02.427 --> 30:05.013
You know what, Cory--
I think it's-- I think you better go.

30:05.806 --> 30:07.516
I mean, you're not a horrible person.

30:07.599 --> 30:09.810
I thoroughly enjoy you.

30:10.853 --> 30:12.938
I mean, maybe you are actually
a horrible person, but--

30:13.021 --> 30:15.023
but I-- I-- I still find you entertaining.

30:15.107 --> 30:17.067
You're a little-- You're a little crazy.

30:17.901 --> 30:20.612
And it… it scares me.

30:23.574 --> 30:24.992
Look, I don't wanna harass you.

30:26.118 --> 30:27.119
Okay.

30:27.202 --> 30:28.704
I've said my piece.

30:28.787 --> 30:32.457
I'm begging you to come back to me,
Alex Levy, on bended knee.

30:32.541 --> 30:35.627
And if you do,
I will support this union at all cost.

30:35.711 --> 30:38.589
You will be my first priority, always.
You have my word.

30:40.299 --> 30:42.968
I'm not coming back. I'm really happy.

30:43.051 --> 30:44.761
Okay,
I'm just asking you to think about it.

30:44.845 --> 30:46.972
-I don't wanna think about it.
-You can tell me tomorrow.

30:47.055 --> 30:49.641
-Think about it for a day.
-I'm telling you no now.

30:49.725 --> 30:50.726
I don't want it.

30:50.809 --> 30:51.894
I hate it.

30:52.686 --> 30:55.314
I would rather die than go back there,
okay?

30:55.397 --> 30:56.815
Well, think about it.

30:56.899 --> 30:58.317
Oh.

31:06.533 --> 31:07.701
Oh, no, Yanko.

31:07.784 --> 31:10.579
Twitter user Simplybarnaby has taken issue
with your weather report,

31:10.662 --> 31:12.206
-I'm afraid to say.
-Oh, my God.

31:12.289 --> 31:13.624
He said, and I will quote him,

31:13.707 --> 31:17.669
"@yankofloresuba owes me $500."

31:17.753 --> 31:21.423
"No rain in the Pacific Northwest? Well,
tell that to my suede Ferragamo loafers."

31:21.507 --> 31:23.091
I am sorry about the shoes, Barnaby,

31:23.175 --> 31:25.886
but I think you need to take this one up
with the spirit upstairs.

31:25.969 --> 31:27.804
Oh, so is that where Barnaby
should send the bill?

31:27.888 --> 31:29.348
Well, he's definitely got deeper pockets.

31:29.431 --> 31:31.558
You take your life in your hands when
you leave the house with suede loafers.

31:31.642 --> 31:34.645
Hey, Mia, you still need to approve
the year-end clip package for tonight.

31:34.728 --> 31:36.563
Right-- Donny, take it.

31:36.647 --> 31:38.190
-Where we going?
-Joel's in the bullpen.

31:38.273 --> 31:41.026
And remember you have a one o'clock
and you have a two o'clock.

31:41.109 --> 31:43.237
-What's my two o'clock?
-Your favorite head of news.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.488
-Hey, Joel.
-Hey, Mia.

31:44.571 --> 31:46.615
Can you weigh in on stories for tomorrow?

31:46.698 --> 31:48.700
-I--
-It'll only take a second. Pick two:

31:48.784 --> 31:52.246
"Pakistan issues health ID cards
to trans people to reduce discrimination."

31:52.329 --> 31:55.832
"China investigates respiratory illness
outbreak, sickening 27."

31:55.916 --> 31:58.460
And, "Eighty people in the Bahamas
tested positive for tuberculosis

31:58.544 --> 32:00.003
in storm shelters after the hurricane."

32:00.087 --> 32:01.463
-Pakistan, Bahamas.
-Thank you.

32:01.547 --> 32:04.842
-Walk with me. Rena, are you good?
-Yeah, I'm just walking. For two.

32:04.925 --> 32:07.135
Joel, give me what you got
for the year-end review, quick.

32:07.219 --> 32:10.848
Okay. Mueller Report.
Perfect Ukraine call.

32:10.931 --> 32:11.932
Impeachment--

32:12.015 --> 32:14.393
Stick to the Trump highlights
or that thing is gonna be four hours.

32:14.476 --> 32:17.354
-Non-Trump?
-College admission scandal.

32:17.437 --> 32:18.689
Brexit.

32:18.772 --> 32:22.526
Notre-Dame burned down,
Australia burned down, the Amazon burned--

32:22.609 --> 32:24.987
Stop. Let's give the people some hope.

32:25.070 --> 32:27.239
Let's give me some hope.
Did anything good happen?

32:27.322 --> 32:29.658
The US won the Women's World Cup.

32:30.367 --> 32:34.037
-Jesus, 2019 sucked!
-Hey.

32:34.121 --> 32:35.998
I really don't wanna be this person,

32:36.081 --> 32:39.418
but do we need to include ourselves
in a packet about 2019?

32:39.501 --> 32:42.129
Yeah,
let's include Alex and Bradley's moment.

32:42.212 --> 32:43.630
Choose that clip wisely.

32:43.714 --> 32:47.259
Play it as a triumphant send-off
to our departing hero, Alex Levy.

32:47.342 --> 32:49.428
No Mitch. At all.

32:49.511 --> 32:51.430
And what about the Hannah of it?

32:54.766 --> 32:56.476
Dedicate the broadcast to Hannah.

32:58.437 --> 33:02.191
Archie was born this year, the royal baby.
That's optimistic.

33:02.274 --> 33:04.651
-Babies are great! Yeah.
-Right?

33:08.780 --> 33:10.365
Oh, hey.
What are you still doing here?

33:10.449 --> 33:12.993
-You should be at home taking a nap.
-Yeah, I will. I will.

33:13.076 --> 33:14.912
It's gonna be a long night. Get some rest.

33:14.995 --> 33:17.789
Hey, Mia,
I've just been thinking, taking stock.

33:17.873 --> 33:21.627
And I realize
sometimes I can be difficult,

33:21.710 --> 33:23.462
but you have always looked out for me.

33:23.545 --> 33:25.923
And even when we were dealing
with some crazy shit.

33:26.006 --> 33:27.925
And if I-- If I wasn't grateful enough,

33:28.008 --> 33:31.470
I just wanna let you know that I--
I am really grateful.

33:32.346 --> 33:33.931
And I just wanna say thank you.

33:39.394 --> 33:40.479
I think he's the right call.

33:40.562 --> 33:42.147
He does well with our old and young demos,

33:42.231 --> 33:44.024
men and women,
and non-gender conforming people.

33:44.107 --> 33:45.150
Yeah, Aaron is great.

33:45.234 --> 33:47.486
I don't know if he'll be enough
to move the needle with the press.

33:47.569 --> 33:49.196
No, but you're not gonna have
any issues with him

33:49.279 --> 33:51.657
like we've had
with some of our other talent, you know?

33:51.740 --> 33:52.741
Aaron's solid.

33:53.784 --> 33:54.910
Let's hope so.

33:55.410 --> 33:56.745
We close down again today.

33:58.497 --> 34:00.958
But, hey, let me know
before we announce officially?

34:01.041 --> 34:02.751
Okay, why?
'Cause Bradley still doesn't know?

34:03.794 --> 34:06.213
Yeah, mostly that. I'm gonna tell her
after the broadcast tonight,

34:06.296 --> 34:08.340
so hold off any press
until after I've told her.

34:08.422 --> 34:09.424
Okay.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.322
Check, check.

34:34.699 --> 34:36.784
Okay. All right, okay. Great. Thank you.

34:38.704 --> 34:39.705
Thank you.

34:51.675 --> 34:54.178
This is crazy. It's so huge.

34:54.261 --> 34:56.679
I mean, it looks huge
when you see it on TV from home,

34:56.763 --> 34:58.056
but when you're in the middle,

34:58.140 --> 35:01.059
it feels like this huge responsibility
that everybody has fun.

35:01.727 --> 35:04.646
-Do you think we're gonna make it fun?
-I know I will.

35:04.730 --> 35:05.731
I don't know about you.

35:05.814 --> 35:07.858
-You are just something else.
-I'm gonna make it fun.

35:07.941 --> 35:10.986
Hey, I've got a little something here,
and I want to make a toast.

35:11.069 --> 35:12.404
-Okay.
-To you.

35:12.487 --> 35:13.488
Uh-oh.

35:13.572 --> 35:15.699
Because you came in
at a really difficult time

35:15.782 --> 35:17.826
and you just really pulled me through it.

35:18.327 --> 35:21.205
You've been, sincerely,
an amazing partner,

35:21.288 --> 35:23.582
and I just-- I just wanna thank you.

35:26.627 --> 35:30.964
Means a lot. Honestly.
And you've been a great partner too.

35:31.548 --> 35:34.301
-Well, here's to the year ahead for us.
-All right.

35:36.261 --> 35:38.555
-I got to?
-Yeah. Go, go, go.

35:39.056 --> 35:40.182
-Quick.
-When in Rome.

35:40.265 --> 35:42.434
Okay, we're back in seven seconds.
Good show, everybody.

35:42.518 --> 35:44.645
Five, four, three.

35:44.728 --> 35:47.231
Camera two,
get the both of them, two-shot.

35:47.314 --> 35:48.315
Onward and upward.

35:48.398 --> 35:51.026
It's December 31st, New Year's Eve,

35:51.109 --> 35:54.321
and all eyes are on Times Square
in New York City

35:54.404 --> 35:56.907
as Baby New Year is starting to crown.

35:56.990 --> 36:00.702
But we have got a lot of fun
in store for you before the ball drops

36:00.786 --> 36:03.622
and 2019 gives way to 2020.

36:03.705 --> 36:07.125
The excitement here is so thick
you can hang your laundry on it.

36:07.209 --> 36:10.462
And why are we so excited, Bradley?
Who are we gonna be seeing tonight?

36:10.546 --> 36:14.591
Well, we got performances by Drake,
Ariana Grande,

36:14.675 --> 36:17.553
and the Radio City Rockettes.
And that's just the beginning!

36:17.636 --> 36:21.431
We'll be checking in throughout the night
with Daniel Henderson and Alison Namazi

36:21.515 --> 36:23.433
down on Bourbon Street, New Orleans.

36:23.517 --> 36:25.978
Ty Fitzgerald
at the Hollywood & Highland complex

36:26.061 --> 36:27.396
in Los Angeles.

36:27.479 --> 36:29.982
Yanko Flores is gonna be down
in the streets,

36:30.065 --> 36:32.234
and Penn & Teller
from the strip in Las Vegas.

36:32.317 --> 36:34.611
So get ready.
Figure out who you're gonna kiss.

36:34.695 --> 36:38.365
Because we've got four hours
until the ball goes down.

36:53.338 --> 36:55.007
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

36:59.469 --> 37:01.555
Oh, God.

37:02.431 --> 37:03.432
Okay.

37:13.817 --> 37:16.862
Hi. How are you? Hello.

37:17.613 --> 37:18.614
Hi.

37:18.697 --> 37:20.574
Is that her?

37:22.409 --> 37:23.827
She showed up.

37:24.494 --> 37:25.954
Oh, my God. It's Alex Levy.

37:26.038 --> 37:27.831
Oh, my God. It's Alex. Hi.

37:27.915 --> 37:29.499
Hi. Hello.

37:30.083 --> 37:31.293
Hi.

37:32.878 --> 37:33.879
Alex?

37:33.962 --> 37:36.256
-Hello.
-I thought you were gonna be in New York.

37:36.340 --> 37:38.342
I know, I had a change of plans.

37:38.425 --> 37:40.802
Lizzy ended up having a party tonight
at the place,

37:40.886 --> 37:44.598
and I just didn't wanna be the lone mom
at a prep school party.

37:44.681 --> 37:46.475
-I'm so glad you're here.
-Me too.

37:46.558 --> 37:49.228
A lot of the people you know
from the book readings are here.

37:49.311 --> 37:50.854
-Yes! Oh, hi.
-Yes.

37:50.938 --> 37:54.483
-Oh, also, Sylvia Portman is here.
-Yes.

37:54.566 --> 37:56.443
-Sylvia-- Yes.
-The psychic.

37:56.527 --> 37:58.111
-Right.
-Her new book's coming out.

37:58.195 --> 37:59.780
-She's doing a signing at the shop.
-Good.

37:59.863 --> 38:02.199
-She is doing readings for everybody.
-Really?

38:02.282 --> 38:04.701
-Sure she'd give you one if you'd like.
-Oh, fun.

38:04.785 --> 38:06.828
-Let's get you a drink.
-Yes.

38:18.382 --> 38:19.800
What are we looking at here, Frank?

38:19.883 --> 38:21.468
I'd say maybe a half hour at this rate,

38:21.552 --> 38:24.221
-but it's just a guess.
-Got it.

38:24.304 --> 38:26.932
-Just sometime this year would be great.
-Yes, sir.

39:04.344 --> 39:05.846
This is Alex.

39:05.929 --> 39:07.723
Please leave a message.

39:09.266 --> 39:11.018
So there's this poem.

39:15.606 --> 39:17.774
Okay. All right.

39:20.611 --> 39:21.862
Your parents have passed on?

39:21.945 --> 39:25.032
Not that I'm aware of.
Should I give 'em a call?

39:29.703 --> 39:32.080
-Well, you have a child.
-I do.

39:32.164 --> 39:33.290
A son?

39:34.291 --> 39:36.418
No, but I'll give you another guess.

39:39.588 --> 39:41.590
I know y'all are having fun,

39:41.673 --> 39:44.051
but New Year's Eve is just getting good.

39:44.134 --> 39:46.929
Ladies and gentlemen, Lauren Alaina.

39:50.516 --> 39:51.808
Thanks.

39:52.434 --> 39:53.769
Put your hands together.

39:53.852 --> 39:56.563
Hey, slow down there.
You got anything for me?

39:57.064 --> 39:59.733
Don't be crazy now.
I know how much is in there.

40:02.152 --> 40:03.487
Oh, my God.

40:03.570 --> 40:05.531
This is unreal. I mean,

40:05.614 --> 40:08.659
if I told my ten-year-old hot-mess self
that this is what I'd be doing,

40:08.742 --> 40:10.619
she would've never believed me.

40:10.702 --> 40:13.205
But it's so fun.
I'm so glad I'm doing it with you too.

40:13.288 --> 40:14.623
Isn't this magical?

40:14.706 --> 40:16.124
Bradley, I gotta tell you something.

40:16.208 --> 40:18.377
-Okay.
-Look, I'm not supposed to tell you this,

40:18.460 --> 40:21.046
but I just don't feel right
keeping it from you.

40:21.129 --> 40:22.130
You all right?

40:22.631 --> 40:24.550
And you're gonna find out soon, anyway.

40:25.300 --> 40:26.301
I'm leaving the show.

40:29.221 --> 40:32.391
Wait, are-- Did they fire you?

40:33.183 --> 40:35.269
-Look, I'll talk to Mia.
-No, no, no, that's not it.

40:36.311 --> 40:37.521
They offered me evening news.

40:40.566 --> 40:41.567
Oh.

40:48.031 --> 40:49.032
Does everybody know?

40:50.701 --> 40:51.702
Yeah.

40:53.412 --> 40:54.496
I'm really sorry.

41:03.130 --> 41:09.845
Well, this card shows a young man who is
or will be very important in your life.

41:09.928 --> 41:12.890
Ooh, gosh. No one that I'm aware of.

41:12.973 --> 41:15.517
But you are in a serious relationship?

41:16.268 --> 41:17.561
No, I'm-- I'm not.

41:18.812 --> 41:23.483
You know, sometimes you have to be willing
to just dig around a little deeper

41:23.567 --> 41:26.486
to let the cards reveal
what they're trying to tell you.

41:27.112 --> 41:28.113
Oh.

41:28.697 --> 41:30.490
But, wait, I thought that was your job.

41:34.953 --> 41:38.081
-I don't wanna scare you.
-I'm pretty sure that's impossible.

41:40.542 --> 41:42.878
Well, I know you don't believe in
what I'm doing.

41:43.879 --> 41:45.589
I kind of think you're right.

41:45.672 --> 41:46.882
I mean no disrespect.

41:46.965 --> 41:48.926
You know what? Let's just shake hands

41:49.009 --> 41:50.135
-and call it a night.
-Okay.

41:50.219 --> 41:51.512
-That was fun.
-That was fun.

41:51.595 --> 41:52.596
Thank you.

41:53.347 --> 41:57.100
To be honest, Alex,
I feel a lot of resistance in you.

41:59.978 --> 42:02.689
What do you mean resistance?
What am-- What am I resisting?

42:03.482 --> 42:06.777
I came for a drink, to see my neighbors,
have some good cheer,

42:07.402 --> 42:09.363
what the fuck am I resisting?

42:10.864 --> 42:15.577
You are carrying around
a paralyzing amount of guilt.

42:23.335 --> 42:24.503
No, I'm not.

42:25.254 --> 42:26.922
Is that what you're running away from?

42:32.302 --> 42:34.054
I'm not running away from anything.

42:46.149 --> 42:47.150
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:47.234 --> 42:48.777
-Have you seen him?
-Seen who?

42:48.861 --> 42:50.320
Tell him I'm looking for him.

42:57.828 --> 43:00.831
Hey. It's going great so far.

43:00.914 --> 43:01.915
You're killing it.

43:01.999 --> 43:04.293
How about I take you out
for a celebratory drink afterward?

43:04.376 --> 43:05.878
What happened to you?

43:06.753 --> 43:09.256
Well, a miracle named Bradley Jackson
walked into my life?

43:09.339 --> 43:11.925
No, no, no. I mean, like, w--
Who the fuck are you?

43:13.218 --> 43:15.554
Because you're not the same person
that I thought you were

43:15.637 --> 43:16.930
when all the Alex shit went down.

43:17.014 --> 43:18.015
What's going on, Bradley?

43:18.098 --> 43:19.808
-What's going on?
-You lied to me.

43:19.892 --> 43:21.393
You put Eric in the evening news.

43:21.476 --> 43:24.688
And apparently,
everybody here knows that except for me.

43:24.771 --> 43:27.900
Seriously? What the fuck, Cory?

43:29.026 --> 43:30.444
You're just gonna have to trust

43:30.527 --> 43:32.946
-that I have your best interests in mind.
-My best interests in mind?

43:33.030 --> 43:35.574
If you had my best interests in mind,
you would've told me the truth.

43:35.657 --> 43:37.826
Goddamn it,
I'm doing the best that I can here. Okay?

43:38.827 --> 43:41.205
-This job is hard.
-Oh, really?

43:41.288 --> 43:43.332
-Everybody's job is fucking hard.
-It doesn't seem that way to you

43:43.415 --> 43:45.584
because I walk in and out of a room
grinning like a Cheshire Cat.

43:45.667 --> 43:47.503
But it is fucking hard,
'cause when I took over,

43:47.586 --> 43:49.171
they didn't give me the keys to a new car,

43:49.254 --> 43:51.131
they gave me a raft
that's so riddled with holes,

43:51.215 --> 43:52.841
and is so crudely patched over
and over a--

43:52.925 --> 43:54.510
There's not even a raft left.

43:54.593 --> 43:57.179
It's just a million patches,
held together by a million more.

43:57.262 --> 43:59.806
And I know you know how that is
because you're the patch

43:59.890 --> 44:02.142
that holds together another patch
every morning at 7:00 a.m.

44:02.226 --> 44:06.688
And I am trying to conjure Noah's Ark
out of thin air.

44:07.189 --> 44:09.483
And I-- Frankly, I think
I'm doing a pretty decent job of it,

44:09.566 --> 44:11.109
-all things considered.
-Are you? Really?

44:11.193 --> 44:13.946
Actually, a pretty great job of it.
And I had hoped, frankly, you and I?

44:14.029 --> 44:16.573
We would be able to walk on together,
two by two.

44:16.657 --> 44:18.575
Is this the part
where I'm supposed to thank you

44:18.659 --> 44:20.869
for saving me from some sort of flood?

44:21.370 --> 44:23.705
Because you only have this job
because of me.

44:26.458 --> 44:28.836
Man, you're just so certain
you know how the world works, huh?

44:28.919 --> 44:31.713
You know, most people in the world
don't give a fuck about anybody else.

44:31.797 --> 44:34.466
They don't care if you live or die.
I'm not talking about you personally.

44:34.550 --> 44:36.510
Most people don't care
if anybody lives or dies

44:36.593 --> 44:38.095
who doesn't answer to the name of "me."

44:38.178 --> 44:43.016
But you, you seem to think somehow
that your friends, your fucking friends,

44:43.100 --> 44:44.560
and I am counting me here,

44:44.643 --> 44:47.062
-are somehow out to get you.
-Oh, oh, let me clarify.

44:47.145 --> 44:48.313
You are not my friend.

44:48.397 --> 44:50.774
You could've been my friend,
but that did not happen.

44:51.275 --> 44:52.985
And I am so glad it did not.

44:53.068 --> 44:56.488
Because all you had to do
was be honest with me.

44:57.114 --> 44:59.908
But it turns out you're just the weasel
that everybody said you were.

44:59.992 --> 45:03.078
It's just never occurred to you
that I obviously, obviously, obviously

45:03.161 --> 45:04.246
can't tell you everything

45:04.329 --> 45:06.915
'cause you're so obsessed
with telling the truth,

45:06.999 --> 45:09.501
I can't be sure
any secret is safe with you.

45:09.585 --> 45:10.627
And also, by the way--

45:10.711 --> 45:12.421
-So this is my fault?
-Pretty much.

45:12.504 --> 45:14.464
'Cause I also can't tell you
how people feel about you

45:14.548 --> 45:15.841
'cause your ego is too damn fragile

45:15.924 --> 45:19.011
to be able to process the information
into something constructive.

45:19.094 --> 45:20.804
-Go to hell.
-There you go, proving my point.

45:20.888 --> 45:22.973
-I told you the truth, proved my point.
-You know what?

45:23.056 --> 45:25.100
Fuck you. My ball's about to drop.

45:38.071 --> 45:39.615
Come on, man.

45:42.784 --> 45:43.827
Fuck it.

45:46.622 --> 45:47.623
Okay.

45:49.333 --> 45:50.334
Jesus.

46:02.721 --> 46:03.722
Oh, shit.

46:14.691 --> 46:17.152
There's this poem
that I've been thinking of.

46:17.236 --> 46:19.196
I had to take a test on
when I was in school.

46:19.279 --> 46:20.447
Most of it doesn't really apply.

46:20.531 --> 46:23.075
It's about the death of this guy's
best friend and he's missing him.

46:23.158 --> 46:24.952
But there-- there's this one line.

46:25.035 --> 46:26.870
It keeps rattling around in my head.

46:26.954 --> 46:30.874
One line that specifically--
It reminds me of you, right now.

46:31.834 --> 46:36.213
"Fame is no plant
that grows on mortal soil."

46:36.880 --> 46:38.549
You are not mortal soil.

46:38.632 --> 46:40.133
Whether you like it or not.

46:40.217 --> 46:43.720
And you can't just throw away
non-mortal soil. That's a sin.

46:43.804 --> 46:46.306
And, I know,
you think you're meant to slow down.

46:46.390 --> 46:47.766
I don't think that's right.

46:48.600 --> 46:50.978
You have yet to do your greatest work.

46:53.063 --> 46:55.607
That non-mortal soil's more fertile
than it's ever been.

46:55.691 --> 46:56.692
I believe that, Alex.

46:56.775 --> 46:59.403
And somewhere inside yourself,
I think you believe that.

47:02.406 --> 47:04.825
So, if I am right,

47:04.908 --> 47:09.162
I need you to call me back
in the next hour and tell me you agree.

47:09.246 --> 47:12.207
And if I'm wrong,

47:12.291 --> 47:14.585
well, go and have a drink
and a laugh at my expense

47:14.668 --> 47:15.919
and enjoy your new year.

47:23.844 --> 47:27.389
And here it is, the great countdown!
Count with us.

47:27.472 --> 47:29.308
-Sixty.
-Fifty-nine.

47:29.391 --> 47:30.809
Fifty-eight.

47:30.893 --> 47:32.477
-Fifty-seven.
-Fifty-six.

47:33.187 --> 47:34.313
Fifty-five.

47:34.396 --> 47:36.064
Yanko,
what are you doing there, man?

47:38.150 --> 47:40.277
-He's counting.
-He's counting down there? Okay.

47:40.360 --> 47:42.696
All right, I hope he's not bothering you.

47:42.779 --> 47:43.780
Alex?

47:44.364 --> 47:46.700
-Hi. Hi.
-Hi. Did you get my message?

47:48.619 --> 47:49.620
I did.

47:50.787 --> 47:52.539
-And?
-And?

47:53.165 --> 47:54.416
It was really nice.

47:54.958 --> 47:55.959
You okay?

47:59.546 --> 48:01.673
-I'm g-- I'm great.
-Okay, listen.

48:02.174 --> 48:04.134
You know we wanna be
in the Alex Levy business

48:04.218 --> 48:05.219
no matter what, Alex.

48:05.302 --> 48:08.430
And I know you got a million problems
that are more important than mine.

48:08.514 --> 48:11.308
Our deal fell through
on Eric's replacement.

48:11.391 --> 48:12.851
We're in a hell of a bind.

48:12.935 --> 48:14.645
You've done The Morning Show,
you've graduated.

48:14.728 --> 48:16.104
You've earned the right to move on.

48:16.730 --> 48:18.482
Could you please…

48:20.108 --> 48:21.568
come back and fill in…

48:23.195 --> 48:26.949
until you're ready to launch
your new prime-time show?

48:35.040 --> 48:38.210
Okay, listen, Cory?
Let's talk tomorrow, okay?

48:38.961 --> 48:42.756
I will call you tomorrow.
Alex, you won't be sorry.

48:46.301 --> 48:47.719
Cory, can I trust you?

48:48.387 --> 48:49.471
Six.

48:49.555 --> 48:51.431
Five. Four.

48:52.140 --> 48:53.308
-Three.
-Yes.

48:53.392 --> 48:56.019
Two. One.

48:56.103 --> 48:58.939
Happy New Year!

51:04.940 --> 51:06.525
Hey, what's up?

51:06.608 --> 51:09.570
Kill the deal with Aaron.
I'll explain tomorrow.

51:09.653 --> 51:13.240
It's a new year, Stella.
Things are looking up.

51:31.675 --> 51:33.010
Fuck!
