We're gonna take you to the vet,
take the bullets out,

24:24.580 --> 24:26.140
and take you to hospital.

then you'd better learn from it,
you little prick, huh?

36:19.080 --> 36:22.197
He had a gun and he was aggressive.
You didn't and you weren't.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.473
Only take someone on when you know
the odds are in your favour.

36:28.200 --> 36:30.236
It doesn't matter what the battle is.

36:33.400 --> 36:36.240
(USES INHALER)

36:36.240 --> 36:37.832
Look, Johnny...

36:39.920 --> 36:41.960
...you could be a son to me,
you know that?

36:41.960 --> 36:47.360
So I know what you want,
and I know how much you want it.

36:47.360 --> 36:51.876
But if you let your guard
down again, bang.

36:53.280 --> 36:55.396
You won't get a third chance.

36:57.760 --> 37:01.360
Keep a clear head, for fuck's sake.
Be patient.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.440
Work people out
before you move on 'em,

37:03.440 --> 37:07.399
and stay legit enough to keep out of jail.

37:18.040 --> 37:19.758
Good boy.

37:34.640 --> 37:38.080
MELISSA: Wait till I tell my sister
I had a cop today.

37:38.080 --> 37:41.040
She would do anything
to sleep with a cop.

37:41.040 --> 37:42.680
MAN: Hmm. Yeah?

37:42.680 --> 37:46.480
Yeah. She even tried
to join up last week.

37:46.480 --> 37:48.040
What was the problem?

37:48.040 --> 37:49.880
Didn't finish high school.

37:49.880 --> 37:52.080
Just dumb, or...

37:52.080 --> 37:53.560
Like hell.

37:53.560 --> 37:56.760
She was getting A-pluses
in everything,

37:56.760 --> 37:59.920
but, you know, she was
doing it all for Dad.

37:59.920 --> 38:03.640
He was station sergeant too.
Big man in town.

38:03.640 --> 38:06.640
And then, in the middle of Year 12,

38:06.640 --> 38:10.040
Mum found out that he was
having this raging affair

38:10.040 --> 38:12.076
and all hell broke loose.

38:13.120 --> 38:17.360
Suddenly she realised
Dad didn't give a rat's arse about her.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.640
And she still loves cops?

38:19.640 --> 38:22.440
She would do anything for a cop.

38:22.440 --> 38:25.200
Well, it's a real love-hate thing, really.

38:25.200 --> 38:27.350
Wouldn't take Freud to figure out why.

38:29.160 --> 38:32.400
You know, if I called her,

38:32.400 --> 38:36.154
she would give you the best sex
you have ever had.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.480
Are you serious?

38:41.480 --> 38:44.120
Oh, my God! OK.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.280
Alright, alright. Tell him I'll try, OK?

38:46.280 --> 38:47.713
Yeah, yeah.

38:49.520 --> 38:50.953
This way.

38:53.480 --> 38:57.080
So, careful. She's a bit shy.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.877
Oh.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.513
(WHIP CRACKS)

39:04.720 --> 39:06.915
Do that again and I'll have to arrest you.

39:11.240 --> 39:12.753
God, I love cops.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.520
Do you need your ventilator?

39:49.520 --> 39:51.954
(SIGHS) Thanks.

39:55.400 --> 39:58.280

40:10.320 --> 40:12.320
George?

40:12.320 --> 40:15.232
George! George.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.398
George!

40:19.440 --> 40:20.998
I'm gone.

40:25.320 --> 40:26.753
(GASPS) I love you.

NARRATOR: Australia's most colourful
racing identity

40:51.720 --> 40:55.160
died quietly and non-violently

40:55.160 --> 40:58.470
after surviving two decades
at the very top of organised crime.

41:13.360 --> 41:18.040
What a stupid, short, ugly,

41:18.040 --> 41:21.032
chain-smoking bloody moron.

41:22.520 --> 41:26.240
I mean, of all the dumb-arsed things
to go and do to me, eh?

41:26.240 --> 41:29.160
(SCOFFS)

41:29.160 --> 41:31.799
Fucking die.

41:33.800 --> 41:35.920
Bastard.

41:35.920 --> 41:38.514
Yeah, yeah, it's shocking.

41:39.920 --> 41:43.880
But look, er, me and some of the boys
were just wondering, though, Lennie,

41:43.880 --> 41:46.240
if you knew where
he invested his money.

41:46.240 --> 41:49.960
I mean, if you need help liquidating
some of his assets,

41:49.960 --> 41:51.520
you know,
just so Georgina's looked after...

41:51.520 --> 41:54.080
Georgina and the kids will be just fine.

41:54.080 --> 41:56.160
I'll see to that, thank you.

41:56.160 --> 41:59.277
Now fuck off, boy!

Yeah. Majority owner now.

NARRATOR: By midafternoon,

43:04.560 --> 43:06.400
anyone who was anyone
was at George's house.

43:06.400 --> 43:12.080
And for now, John just had to watch,
seeing how the sides were aligning...

43:12.080 --> 43:14.514
who was talking to who.

43:22.920 --> 43:26.240
And the whisper was out
that Billy Bayeh's sudden good fortune

43:26.240 --> 43:29.800
had also played nicely into the hands
of his older brother,

from Parramatta, Louis Bayeh.
