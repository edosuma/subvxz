- It's just one month rent.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.682
- Oh. Someone told you?
- No.

07:32.719 --> 07:36.087
He's a missionary, Banerjee.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.256
You said it yourself.

07:38.258 --> 07:41.993
First, conversions,
then imperialism.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.061
You want to support that?

[telephone ringing]

07:44.798 --> 07:46.064
Mm.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.735
Hello. No, I'm busy now.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.509
Sir.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.078
Do you know how much it costs

08:00.080 --> 08:03.014
to convert someone
to Christianity?

08:03.016 --> 08:06.351
Five hundred among the poor.
Ten dollars.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.553
Less, I think, if the convert
happens to be a leper.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.424
So?

08:12.426 --> 08:13.959
Sir, a missionary flies back
to the West

08:13.961 --> 08:15.994
and tells them
that he's converted 1000 people,

08:15.996 --> 08:17.462
for which, of course,
he gets paid,

08:17.464 --> 08:20.966
but which is much more
than $10 per person.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.667
[chuckles] Good business.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.836
Yes. But the law here
in Orissa states that

08:24.838 --> 08:27.472
no person shall convert
or attempt to convert any person

08:27.474 --> 08:29.541
from one religious faith
to another.

08:29.543 --> 08:33.278
Yes, by use of force
or by inducement

08:33.280 --> 08:35.580
or by any fraudulent means.

08:37.651 --> 08:41.486
Sir, and yet not one missionary
has been charged.

08:41.488 --> 08:45.290
Not yet.
That would make good news, sir.

08:45.292 --> 08:48.260
[dramatic music]

08:55.168 --> 08:58.904
You bring me evidence
of illegal conversion

08:58.906 --> 09:01.406
by Graham Staines.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.642
I'll give you
a permanent position.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.411
Loan me a camera, sir,
and I'll get you photo evidence.

09:08.882 --> 09:12.050
I'll loan you a camera, but...

09:12.052 --> 09:14.085
I need a deposit.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.987
How much money do you have?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.866
Why do you have security
in this office?

09:27.868 --> 09:29.935
He's mad! Send him out!

Mad fool.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.940
Dead is dead.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.682
This will do.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.850
There's a conversion
of a tribal girl

09:45.852 --> 09:47.652
in Baripada tomorrow.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.057

can I pay you tomorrow?

10:10.210 --> 10:11.977
No.

Do you want me
to write about your bus?

10:22.589 --> 10:24.489
Halfway to BP Town,
this bus will be packed

10:24.491 --> 10:27.392
like cattle going to slaughter,
way beyond the seat limits.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.870
Th-- this is

- No. Her mother is a Christian.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.322
Don't touch. Let it go.

17:38.324 --> 17:39.924
You can do
any illegal conversion?

17:39.926 --> 17:41.526
- You can do what you like, huh?
- Who are you to ask?

17:41.528 --> 17:43.061
- This is not done!
- Let it go!

- Why didn't you tell me?
- A month early.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.352
- No, no. Your wife.
- Yeah?

20:21.354 --> 20:23.888
She's bleeding.
Bleeding very much.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.389

20:40.273 --> 20:43.207
I've made her comfortable.

20:43.209 --> 20:46.544
The uterus should contract now.

20:46.546 --> 20:50.214
But she has lost a lot of blood.
Too much.

20:50.216 --> 20:52.683
And if she continues to bleed...

Manav: Sir, I need the money,
sir, so I...

21:10.870 --> 21:13.271
I'm sorry, Banerjee.
We have rules.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.705
Sir, I was attacked, sir.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.107
They didn't want to be
photographed, sir.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.042
Still, your responsibility.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.910
Sir, my wife is in hospital.
I've borrowed money

21:19.912 --> 21:21.245
to pay for medication
and blood, sir.

21:21.247 --> 21:23.648
I'm sorry,
that's your family matter.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.450
Sir.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.787
Mm.

Good afternoon, sir.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.243
Yes, I think I have.

21:56.249 --> 21:57.715
He's good.

22:06.326 --> 22:09.860
Evidence of fraudulent
conversions by Staines

22:09.862 --> 22:12.997
are not easily come by.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.633
Sir, inducements
come in many forms, so...

22:15.635 --> 22:18.469
For success in an endeavor
like this,

22:18.471 --> 22:20.838
someone needs to become
a Christian

22:20.840 --> 22:23.708
in order to gain their trust.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.610
Thereby gather
the necessary evidence.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.612
Enough to use in a court of law.

22:30.616 --> 22:34.018
An endeavor worthy of support,
don't you think, Kedar?

22:34.020 --> 22:35.619
Certainly, sir.

22:39.058 --> 22:42.693
Of course, the person
who does this

22:42.695 --> 22:45.029
will have contact with lepers.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.231
[indistinct shouting]

Uh-huh.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.907

23:03.049 --> 23:06.817
Leprosy is the veil
behind which Staines operates.

23:06.819 --> 23:09.220
<i> The tool he uses.</i>

23:09.222 --> 23:12.390
You may need to prove
your loyalty with conversion.

23:18.331 --> 23:21.165
You take this,
you go all the way.

23:26.272 --> 23:28.072
- Banerjee.
- Sir.

23:30.076 --> 23:33.544
- To help you get around.
- And to get to church on time.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.780
[laughs]

23:48.795 --> 23:51.529
- Have you thought of a name?
- No.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.632
I like Vardanuja.

23:55.868 --> 23:58.302
- Gift of life?
- Hm.

23:58.304 --> 23:59.503
Hm.

- David?
- He gets too excited.

25:26.792 --> 25:28.659
Can't think you can push
a journalist around

25:28.661 --> 25:31.695
and get away with it.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.230
He means well.

25:33.232 --> 25:36.567
They have this law for a reason.

25:36.569 --> 25:40.037
'Cause there's people out there
not doing the right thing.

25:40.039 --> 25:42.039
We have to be above reproach.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.043

25:46.045 --> 25:47.611

25:53.252 --> 25:56.921
- No point.
- I saw money change hands.

25:56.923 --> 26:00.724
Yeah, it happens every day,
every time you buy something.

26:00.726 --> 26:03.594
The Orissa Freedom
of Religion Act states that

26:03.596 --> 26:06.597
no person shall convert
or attempt to convert.

26:10.202 --> 26:11.635
You're right.

26:13.339 --> 26:15.205
But David, he suffers
the same disappointments

26:15.207 --> 26:17.608
that you do
when people are bought.

26:17.610 --> 26:20.277
He gets frustrated.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.514
We can't make any mistakes.

26:23.516 --> 26:26.750
Somebody's always going
to be trying to take this land.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.452
If that happens...

26:29.855 --> 26:31.822
who's gonna look after the home?

26:33.125 --> 26:35.159
Who's gonna defend them?

26:36.262 --> 26:37.628
Sundar?

26:39.365 --> 26:41.999
Misayel and Padma?

26:47.273 --> 26:49.273
No one would listen to David.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.810
I know.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.046
We must pray.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.092
Were you given any money?

27:08.094 --> 27:09.793
You are not registered
as a Christian.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.462
My mother is a Christian.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.664
But your father was not.

27:13.666 --> 27:16.667
- Sir, see, sir. Made to sign.
- It's just ownership.

27:16.669 --> 27:18.235
No, it's conversion.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.471
The affidavit
was not submitted

27:20.473 --> 27:22.339
and the conversion
was not registered.

27:22.341 --> 27:25.409
I will do the paperwork, sir.
I will.

27:25.411 --> 27:26.977
Woman 1: Now you get back
to work.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.912
Don't think you can take
any more liberties. Come!

27:28.914 --> 27:30.781
Half the day's gone
and nobody has done anything.

27:30.783 --> 27:33.484
Is that it?

I can have you arrested
for assault.

Mishra: Banerjee? Banerjee,
what have you been doing?

27:49.468 --> 27:51.502
We are paying you to convert.

27:51.504 --> 27:53.037
Sir, but I cannot convert
immediately.

27:53.039 --> 27:55.706
- That will be suspicious, so...
Mishra: Of course.

27:55.708 --> 27:58.709
But why are you making enemies
among Christians?

27:58.711 --> 28:01.979
I know what you've been doing.
Now leave the girl alone.

- Do you know Staines?
- Of course.

Is he into conversions?

<i> He gives you work</i>

28:36.882 --> 28:39.316

28:41.854 --> 28:44.254
No inducement brings
real conversion, anyway.

One day I'll find the proof
of him converting the tribals.

Business, sir. Business.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.970
Did the church give you money
to become a Christian?

29:32.972 --> 29:36.707
No. Instead I give money
to church every month.

29:36.709 --> 29:38.475
My offering.

29:41.580 --> 29:44.648
As a fellow Rotarian, we believe
in service before self.

expendability."

30:50.382 --> 30:53.984
What does expendability mean?

That's when somebody
does something

somebody else thinks
doesn't matter.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.824
Why?

31:00.826 --> 31:03.393
Well, for us...

31:03.395 --> 31:06.396
it's because
they don't know God...

31:06.398 --> 31:08.232
because they're the ones
that don't realize

31:08.234 --> 31:12.069
that they're living lives
that have no eternal value.

33:20.432 --> 33:21.932
Not about me.

I didn't want the lift,

33:26.672 --> 33:29.339

with the work you do.

55:51.148 --> 55:54.383

55:56.721 --> 55:58.187
Sometimes.

56:02.193 --> 56:05.227
My wife's in hospital.

56:05.229 --> 56:08.230
The doctors advise a transfer
to the city for surgery.

56:10.034 --> 56:12.034
We cannot afford to pay.

56:20.411 --> 56:23.579
What if I become a... Christian?

56:32.757 --> 56:34.923
That would be
a forced conversion.

56:37.995 --> 56:40.562
So fear...

56:40.564 --> 56:42.765
unfounded fear prevents you.

56:46.337 --> 56:48.470
I'll pray about it.

Laki! Come on!

57:05.523 --> 57:07.189
Faster, faster.

57:07.191 --> 57:08.891
I know you can do it!
You can make it!

57:08.893 --> 57:10.058
You're nearly there!

57:10.060 --> 57:12.194
Come on, run, run, run, run!

57:12.196 --> 57:15.264

57:28.646 --> 57:31.880
You know, Jesus healed
ten lepers once.

57:31.882 --> 57:34.783
How many you think
came back to thank Him?

57:34.785 --> 57:37.586
- Not all?
- One.

57:37.588 --> 57:39.788
But he still healed them all.

57:41.559 --> 57:43.525
So will you help my wife?

57:47.765 --> 57:49.965
God's the one
that can really help.

57:49.967 --> 57:52.067
Why don't you ask Him?

57:53.270 --> 57:55.003
I'm asking you.

57:58.442 --> 58:01.410
Like I said, I'll pray about it.

58:05.282 --> 58:08.350
Why don't you check out
the preaching? Good crowd today.

58:15.993 --> 58:18.327
I promise to come back
and thank you.

58:21.932 --> 58:24.600
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, boys.

58:24.602 --> 58:26.201
- Hi.
- I saw you out there.

58:26.203 --> 58:28.770
- Are you done today?
- Yeah, you did real well.

58:28.772 --> 58:30.739

- Hm.

58:54.865 --> 58:57.733

in Manoharpur?

59:05.409 --> 59:07.809
Hey, don't be nervous.

59:07.811 --> 59:09.311
No, I...

59:09.313 --> 59:11.880
Just surprised to see you here,
that's all.

59:11.882 --> 59:14.550
Are you sure?
You are not Christian?

59:17.922 --> 59:20.322
What if I was?

we shouldn't blame chickens.

- Hi.

1:01:51.175 --> 1:01:53.842
You here for the evening dance,
or just more research?

I'm getting it.

be in danger out here?

called Mahendra?

1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:17.632
Which one?

1:02:21.071 --> 1:02:24.339
He doesn't like missionaries.

1:02:24.341 --> 1:02:27.075
Being a missionary
is not a popularity contest.

1:02:28.846 --> 1:02:32.080
- You heard something?
- I'm not certain.

for both.

who had paid.

- It's fine.

been paid for bed number 6?

- No.

1:04:34.705 --> 1:04:36.404
Where have you been, Banerjee?

1:04:36.406 --> 1:04:38.306
Sir, my wife was left out there
on a stretcher, sir.

1:04:38.308 --> 1:04:39.841
Why are you telling me?

1:04:39.843 --> 1:04:41.243
Sir, you said
you'll pay the hospital.

1:04:41.245 --> 1:04:44.079
I paid.
She's young. She'll be fine.

1:04:44.081 --> 1:04:46.147
Sir, I can't work
if my wife isn't cared for.

1:04:46.149 --> 1:04:47.849
Here's a thought.

1:04:47.851 --> 1:04:49.584
If you're spending time
with her,

1:04:49.586 --> 1:04:51.019
why should I pay the hospital?

1:04:51.021 --> 1:04:52.354
Sir, I'm working, sir.

1:04:52.356 --> 1:04:54.656
I'm paying you to convert,
Banerjee.

1:04:54.658 --> 1:04:55.924
To get some real evidence.

1:04:55.926 --> 1:04:56.992
Sir, but if I find evidence,

1:04:56.994 --> 1:04:58.260
evidence is evidence, right?

1:04:58.262 --> 1:05:01.196
You do what I'm paying you for

1:05:01.198 --> 1:05:02.564

Oh, is he also
converting illegally?

1:05:54.584 --> 1:05:57.719
I saw him buying alcohol.
I saw him at Manoharpur--

1:05:57.721 --> 1:06:00.155
That area is not
under our jurisdiction.

1:06:00.157 --> 1:06:04.793
- Who's it under?
- Um, um, Thakurmunda.

1:06:04.795 --> 1:06:07.595
- Can you call them?
- And tell them what?

I'm sure he's trouble.
