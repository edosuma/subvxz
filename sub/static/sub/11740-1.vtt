Corn's up 3 cents. You sold
for less last week, didn't you?

03:21.904 --> 03:24.123
We shouldn't be doing this,
it's not right.

03:24.282 --> 03:25.453
Not right?

03:25.615 --> 03:27.617
Let me remind you
what Dad always says:

03:27.785 --> 03:30.959
"When a man stops wanting,
a man stops living. "

03:31.122 --> 03:33.499
When your brother Grant
gets here next week,

03:33.666 --> 03:35.964
he'll be ABC-ing,
"always be closing. "

03:37.045 --> 03:40.015
You know he used to keep his suit
in his gym locker

03:40.172 --> 03:42.516
in case a funeral needed
a trumpet player?

03:42.675 --> 03:46.053
Actually I did know that because
we went to the same high school.

03:46.219 --> 03:49.098
You're too dark, son.
That's always been your problem.

03:49.264 --> 03:52.438
People like winners,
people with good attitudes.

03:56.606 --> 03:58.699
Okay, here we come.

04:05.238 --> 04:09.584
Dean. These people are bereaved and
they need condolences from a family.

04:09.743 --> 04:13.043
Family is you and me.
I don't wanna be a part of this family.

04:13.205 --> 04:15.754
I'd love to talk about that
at some later date,

04:15.916 --> 04:17.634
but I want you to get out,

04:17.793 --> 04:21.262
we're gonna go over and you're
gonna shake this family's hand.

04:21.922 --> 04:23.138
Let's go.

04:36.769 --> 04:38.362
On behalf of David's family,

04:38.522 --> 04:41.365
I'd like to thank you
for attending this service

04:41.525 --> 04:45.370
of respect and dedication
for their beloved father and farmer.

04:46.237 --> 04:49.116
Death, in a number of ways,
unites us all,

04:49.281 --> 04:53.457
and David's demands that
each of us put aside our toil

04:53.619 --> 04:55.462
to unite ourselves in his honor.

04:55.621 --> 04:59.842
Today we share the bond of
love and friendship for David.

05:00.250 --> 05:05.803
The farmer, who depends directly
on rain and sunshine and climate,

05:05.965 --> 05:07.808
must be a person of faith.

05:07.967 --> 05:11.847
He has faith in the Creator
every time he plants a seed.

05:12.011 --> 05:14.640
Sorry for your loss.
Mr. Pritchard.

05:14.807 --> 05:16.228
Elizabeth.

05:16.392 --> 05:18.565
I'm Henry Whipple.
This is my son, Dean.

05:18.727 --> 05:20.400
Henry. Dean.
Thanks for coming.

05:20.563 --> 05:22.781
Dean and myself,
really our whole family,

05:22.939 --> 05:25.489
we wanna extend our
sympathies to your family.

05:25.650 --> 05:28.244
Did you know Dad?
Oh, surely I knew of him.

05:28.404 --> 05:30.826
We belonged to the same co-op.

05:30.989 --> 05:35.495
And I know your dad owned
200 acres that he rented out.

05:35.660 --> 05:36.912
What are you getting at?

05:37.078 --> 05:40.173
Seeing as how you live down
in the big city of St. Louis,

05:40.331 --> 05:43.505
it's gonna be a hassle
for you to oversee that property.

05:43.668 --> 05:45.966
And I just wanted to
let you know

05:46.128 --> 05:48.302
I'm prepared
to take it off your hands.

05:48.464 --> 05:50.683
Get out of here.
Don't decide now.

05:50.842 --> 05:53.595
When the time is right,
you can talk it over...

05:53.761 --> 05:56.435
I said go away.
You're sick.

05:57.265 --> 06:02.192
All right. I know that you're in
grief, sir, but you do have my card.

06:04.189 --> 06:06.065
I'm sorry.

06:07.858 --> 06:10.453
What? Sharks.

06:10.611 --> 06:14.741
I've been renting and farming
Pritchard's land for 10 years.

06:14.907 --> 06:16.534
Stay away from it, hoss.

06:17.243 --> 06:18.869
Okay.

06:27.252 --> 06:30.756
Grant would've closed it. ABC, right?
That's not funny.

06:30.923 --> 06:34.017
That land was gonna be
his "welcome home" gift.

06:35.802 --> 06:39.021
Sir, I am so sorry...
I can't stand you kind of people.

06:39.181 --> 06:43.186
But Elizabeth can't deal with this and
I don't ever wanna come back to Iowa.

06:43.352 --> 06:46.821
Going price is 8000 an acre.
Where do we sign?

06:57.199 --> 07:00.828
Oh. The cool kids have graced
us with their presence.

07:02.620 --> 07:05.124
Rolling out the "welcome
home" carpet for Grant.

07:05.289 --> 07:07.132
Are these enough cookies?

07:07.708 --> 07:10.053
No. More.

07:16.759 --> 07:19.603
You again.
Why do you always eat standing up?

07:20.096 --> 07:23.770
Because, Cadence,
who does time wait for?

07:25.059 --> 07:26.731
I don't know.

07:26.936 --> 07:30.315
No man. Time waits for no man.

07:34.776 --> 07:37.620
Oh, no, no.
I wouldn't wanna trouble you.

07:40.032 --> 07:44.003
Grant's gonna flip when he
sees the 200 acres I got him.

08:03.430 --> 08:06.684
He's finally coming home.
Yes, he is.

08:14.024 --> 08:17.324
Expand or die, gentlemen.

08:17.484 --> 08:18.610
Get big,

08:19.445 --> 08:20.823
or get out.

08:20.989 --> 08:25.836
We all know this is what it takes
to make it in modern agriculture.

08:25.994 --> 08:28.042
Grain prices
are at an all-time high

08:28.203 --> 08:31.834
and traders are betting on corn
like it's the new gold.

08:32.374 --> 08:35.754
Corn alone is a 2 trillion-dollar
market, gentlemen,

08:35.919 --> 08:40.265
and you, you are responsible
for that money.

08:40.424 --> 08:43.803
I've got a PhD in microbiology
and I've been working closely

08:43.969 --> 08:47.974
with farmers from your community,
like the Liberty Seed salesman

08:48.140 --> 08:49.733
Jim Johnson and Sons. Jim.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.444
Thanks very much.
Heh-heh-heh.

08:52.602 --> 08:55.106
We've had a chance to
sit down and talk about

08:55.272 --> 09:00.573
how AgriWarrior can create
a nutrient explosion in your soil.

09:00.736 --> 09:04.786
If your soil is like most, you've got
an abundance of insoluble nutrients...

09:04.948 --> 09:08.998
We should just rotate our crops
and avoid the effects of glyphosate.

09:09.161 --> 09:10.788
How'd you know that?

09:10.954 --> 09:12.877
I've been on the farm
my whole life.

09:13.040 --> 09:17.385
Kind of picked a few things up.
He's right. Rotating never hurts.

09:17.543 --> 09:20.889
Hey, where are you going?
I'm going to the bathroom.

09:21.799 --> 09:25.553
Iron is up over 54 percent.
University tests...

09:25.761 --> 09:28.138
Bringing a whole other
tractor into the field.

09:28.304 --> 09:30.898
About gave us a heart attack,
but it was exciting.

09:31.099 --> 09:32.692
Hey.

09:33.309 --> 09:35.277
Don't these look like
bloody fingers?

09:35.436 --> 09:37.279
Sounds appetizing.
Let's go.

09:37.438 --> 09:40.942
Hi, Mr. Richardson. How are you?
Saw your race last weekend.

09:41.109 --> 09:44.830
That foot is made of lead.
It's gonna get you to NASCAR.

09:44.987 --> 09:45.988
Thank you.

09:46.155 --> 09:49.034
I said the same thing
to Chuck Young back in '88.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.794
Have I told you that story?
Yes, sir, you did.

09:51.953 --> 09:54.797
Actually, we just gotta get going.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, son.

09:54.956 --> 09:57.333
You and Chuck Young
are not the same.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.422
You use your head.

09:59.585 --> 10:03.305
And Chuck, I'm sorry to say,
wasn't long on brainpower.

10:03.463 --> 10:06.137
Thank you very much.
We gotta get going. Thank you.

10:06.299 --> 10:08.598
Very nice sitting next to you.
Thank you.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.854
Dean, the whole town's
behind you.

10:11.012 --> 10:12.560
Thank you, sir.

10:12.764 --> 10:15.859
Oh, come on! I thought it
was just me and you tonight.

10:16.017 --> 10:18.019
Torgeson, we can still hold hands.

10:18.186 --> 10:19.904
Fuck, no.

10:20.605 --> 10:23.734
What's up, brother?
Let's do it.

10:36.496 --> 10:38.247
Dude, you're not listening to me.

10:38.415 --> 10:41.964
You are figure-eight point leader,
two years running.

10:42.126 --> 10:46.507
Figure eight's amateur hour, dude.
I gotta move up to asphalt tracks, man.

10:46.673 --> 10:48.891
Asphalt is for getting
to the dirt tracks.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.428
ARCA's got that
big sponsorship money, man.

10:51.595 --> 10:52.971
That big money. Big money.

10:53.137 --> 10:56.858
You're gonna have to make some
big changes to make it to ARCA.

10:57.016 --> 11:00.816
I'm doing ARCA.
It's the next step to NASCAR.

11:01.187 --> 11:02.985
You got your 9 mill in here?

11:03.147 --> 11:04.945
Hell, yeah, man. All day.

11:05.566 --> 11:09.070
It's for the thugs.
It's a pretty little bitch, ain't it?

11:10.279 --> 11:13.123
Drive to Rippey.
Ain't nothing in Rippey

11:13.282 --> 11:16.456
but ditch water and herpes.
It's like two hours away.

11:16.619 --> 11:19.623
What else were you gonna do
with two hours in Iowa?

11:19.788 --> 11:21.335
Let's go.

11:25.711 --> 11:28.430
I gotta ask you something.
I need a job.

11:28.589 --> 11:31.342
Uh-oh. What about
your seed cleaning business?

11:31.509 --> 11:35.183
After 42 years,
I have to close my doors.

11:35.762 --> 11:38.982
Nobody uses natural seeds
anymore, look around.

11:39.140 --> 11:41.189
Ninety percent
are genetically modified.

11:41.352 --> 11:44.025
Ninety-three percent
GMOs and rising.

11:44.188 --> 11:46.064
Yeah, well, whatever.

11:46.232 --> 11:49.701
That place of yours, that's gotta
be worth at least 3 million.

11:49.859 --> 11:52.408
Well, that's tied up
in equipment mostly.

11:52.570 --> 11:55.540
And besides, what if
we have another dust bowl?

11:55.698 --> 11:59.293
That's a mighty disappointing
thing to say to a friend.

11:59.452 --> 12:02.797
Especially after the not-so-legal
job I did for you in the past.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.458
Hey. Whoa. Huh.

12:05.833 --> 12:08.507
Will you keep your voice down?

12:10.879 --> 12:13.224
I paid you then, remember?

12:13.383 --> 12:17.104
I'm just reminding you,
that's all. That's all.

12:17.303 --> 12:19.646
Well, I don't like it.

12:20.639 --> 12:24.689
All I'm saying, begging.

12:24.851 --> 12:29.027
Is even one or two days a week
of honest work would help me.

12:29.190 --> 12:31.863
I'm sorry, buddy,
I can't give you a job.

12:32.025 --> 12:34.448
I hope it doesn't come between us.

12:37.197 --> 12:39.871
Congratulations on a fine talk.
Thanks very much.

12:40.034 --> 12:41.159
Henry Whipple.
Yeah.

12:41.326 --> 12:44.170
You've heard of me. Number
one Liberty Seed salesman

12:44.329 --> 12:46.502
in seven counties
of southwestern Iowa,

12:46.665 --> 12:49.418
including Greene,
Union, Ringgold, Decatur...

12:49.585 --> 12:51.428
Is that right? Ha-ha-ha.
Sure is. Ha, ha.

12:51.587 --> 12:54.181
And I have a nice-sized farm
up in Churdan,

12:54.339 --> 12:56.182
family-owned for four generations.

12:56.341 --> 12:59.094
Three thousand seven hundred
acres, as of today.

12:59.261 --> 13:02.435
Now, if I could be personally
certain of your product,

13:02.597 --> 13:05.692
give it the Whipple seal
of approval,

13:06.018 --> 13:09.363
maybe there's something
that I could do to help you.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.364
Are you asking for free samples?

13:11.522 --> 13:16.950
Sir, I never ask anything from a man
other than respect, trust and loyalty.

13:17.112 --> 13:20.786
Jim. Jim. Thank you so much
for letting me use your name.

13:20.949 --> 13:24.669
No. My pleasure. What you said about
glyphosate locking up nutrients

13:24.827 --> 13:27.046
like manganese and iron
struck a chord.

13:27.204 --> 13:29.673
We'll spread the word.
Count on it.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.048
Henry.
Jim.

13:33.210 --> 13:35.633
Everything good?
Hunky-dory.

13:39.925 --> 13:41.722
I can see that you're all tied up.

13:41.886 --> 13:43.934
We'll talk later. Um...
Yes.

13:44.096 --> 13:47.066
Just remember,
I am number one in seven counties,

13:47.266 --> 13:49.394
including Boone, Garrison,
Decatur...

13:49.559 --> 13:51.938
Dad's got Decatur.
Brad.

13:52.355 --> 13:56.201
What are you talking about?
Sorry, Henry.

13:56.358 --> 14:00.114
There's no apologies needed. I know
Brad's kidding about Decatur, right?

14:00.278 --> 14:02.497
No. Dad took it last week.

14:02.656 --> 14:05.409
We're number one
in 24 counties now.

14:05.575 --> 14:06.828
"Took" is a strong word.

14:06.994 --> 14:10.042
- You know, if this is a bad time?
- No. Not at all, Roger.

14:10.205 --> 14:14.255
Just a meeting of the minds, a couple of
Liberty men. That's all. Right, Henry?

14:14.417 --> 14:16.670
So, what customer
did you take?

14:16.836 --> 14:19.259
Just some people.
Some people?

14:19.422 --> 14:22.801
Wanted to try a new tactic
on their farms, that's all.

14:22.967 --> 14:25.345
I'm sure they'll be back
with you next year. Oh.

14:25.512 --> 14:28.982
If you'll excuse me, I wanted to
introduce Roger to the boys here.

14:29.140 --> 14:32.019
My oldest, Brad. You met him.
Good to see you again.

14:32.185 --> 14:35.234
My goodness, it's been years.
My second son, Brett.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.195
How are you? Pleasure.
Look at you.

14:44.154 --> 14:48.706
What the hell are you acting like some
cyborg assassin for all of a sudden?

14:48.868 --> 14:50.414
I'm making some changes.

14:50.577 --> 14:54.377
Guns are for thugs, not farmers.

15:00.087 --> 15:01.885
Oh!

15:02.923 --> 15:06.268
Fucking A! Jesus Christ!

15:06.427 --> 15:08.475
Crap! Whore!

15:08.637 --> 15:11.265
Whorey whore!

15:11.432 --> 15:15.687
Holy shit! A Vortech supercharger!
You're gonna fly with this thing!

15:15.853 --> 15:17.105
Oh, my God!

15:17.271 --> 15:19.774
- You are insane!
- Oh, my God!

15:19.982 --> 15:23.235
You are fucking insane!
Look. I got you an air freshener.

15:23.610 --> 15:25.282
Let's go.

15:27.030 --> 15:29.579
Ow! Hoo-hoo!

15:53.181 --> 15:56.025
You're weren't kidding
when you said you finish first.

15:56.184 --> 15:59.484
I should have gotten you out
of my system a long time ago.

16:14.159 --> 16:16.663
What am I gonna tell Dad?

16:16.829 --> 16:18.296
About what?

16:18.456 --> 16:20.800
About Decatur, the county.

16:20.957 --> 16:23.335
It's gone. Harvested away.

16:23.503 --> 16:28.633
Jim Johnson, that shark, he
passes half his sales commissions

16:28.799 --> 16:32.178
under the table in cash
to bribe my customers.

16:32.803 --> 16:35.477
Sounds like the mafia.
Ugh.

16:40.393 --> 16:42.771
Dad gave me everything.

16:43.688 --> 16:47.443
Granddad before him.
I can't let them down.

17:31.694 --> 17:33.696
In here, somebody
who wants to see you.

17:33.863 --> 17:36.115
Hey, Dad.
George Naylor's here.

17:36.282 --> 17:38.501
Hey, Cliff. It's been a while.
Yeah.

17:38.659 --> 17:42.209
You know it's Customer Appreciation
Day and not the Fourth of July?

17:42.371 --> 17:44.839
It's called marketing, Dad.

17:44.998 --> 17:48.878
And you're the first invitee, George.
End of summer. Be there.

17:49.043 --> 17:52.843
You lose any more counties, there
won't be any customers to appreciate.

17:53.006 --> 17:54.350
We got it covered.

18:18.907 --> 18:23.208
What I'll do, I'm gonna load you up
with a tote of Liberty 780R seeds,

18:23.369 --> 18:24.495
see how that does.

18:24.662 --> 18:27.381
Knock-knock. I brought
barbecue sands and some pop.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.134
From Tater's? You betcha.
No time to make them.

18:30.543 --> 18:34.218
And I know you like extra bacon,
so I got an extra side for you.

18:34.380 --> 18:38.226
Now you're talking. Slaw in there?
Yeah. Slaw.

18:38.759 --> 18:40.511
There's that.

18:40.761 --> 18:42.264
Oh, yeah.

18:44.223 --> 18:45.474
What is it, honey?

18:48.102 --> 18:49.523
"Dear Morn and Dad:

18:49.686 --> 18:53.532
Greetings from Mount Aconcagua
in the Andes, ahem,

18:53.690 --> 18:55.818
tallest mountain in South America.

18:55.985 --> 18:59.079
Guess what. I'm going to climb it.

18:59.279 --> 19:01.498
The people here are so friendly.

19:01.657 --> 19:06.413
Hope this postcard finds you in time.
Say hi to Dean. Love, Grant. "

19:06.787 --> 19:10.007
It looks romantic.
That's a bunch of hogwash.

19:10.165 --> 19:13.385
That kid's so off the grid
he doesn't even bother to call.

19:13.543 --> 19:16.716
Henry, make yourself useful,
take me out of here.

19:17.172 --> 19:20.766
I think I gotta get going too.
Well, hold on there now, George.

19:20.926 --> 19:23.304
We haven't even had
a chance to talk turkey

19:23.469 --> 19:27.394
or barbecue, as it were. Heh, heh. I
mean, am I losing a customer here?

19:27.556 --> 19:30.560
Of course not, Henry.
Then sit down, take a load off.

19:30.726 --> 19:35.448
Oh, cut the bull. First Decatur
and now Grant. You lost him, Henry.

19:35.606 --> 19:37.483
You never should have let him go.

19:51.706 --> 19:52.832
Yo, yo, yo!

20:09.556 --> 20:13.231
Come on. Come here.
No. No, I can't drive.

20:13.393 --> 20:15.112
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
No.

20:17.023 --> 20:20.117
Aah!
There you go. Straighten out. Whoo!

20:29.034 --> 20:31.787
I like the sound your car makes
with its new part.

20:31.953 --> 20:35.548
Don't point that at people.
It's dangerous.

20:59.773 --> 21:02.902
Promise not to do what you did
at the auto shop again.

21:03.735 --> 21:05.327
Yeah.

21:07.906 --> 21:09.658
Okay.

21:12.786 --> 21:15.288
Because I kind of really
like you.

21:28.717 --> 21:31.061
Oh, congratulations.
You must be proud.

21:31.220 --> 21:33.518
Thanks. What for?

21:33.680 --> 21:36.229
Your son's a real-life hero.

21:37.893 --> 21:40.897
"Grant Whipple to climb
tallest mountain in Americas. "

21:41.063 --> 21:43.156
Jeez.

21:43.314 --> 21:45.066
The whole county
already knows.

21:45.233 --> 21:48.032
Relax, Henry.
You're gonna sprain something.

21:49.153 --> 21:52.077
Why are my own children
sabotaging me?

21:52.240 --> 21:55.995
Does Grant not care one iota
about the 200 acres I got him?

21:56.160 --> 21:59.039
And Dean?
Oh, he's a lost cause.

21:59.205 --> 22:02.380
Why does he consistently
disrespect me?

22:02.543 --> 22:04.715
Every man wants something
to call his own.

22:07.088 --> 22:08.840
What's wrong with the farm?

22:09.006 --> 22:11.759
That's yours.
No. It's the family's.

22:11.926 --> 22:15.021
Same difference.
Maybe not to Dean.

22:16.097 --> 22:17.974
Breathe out.

22:48.503 --> 22:49.800
Dean.

22:51.965 --> 22:54.138
Hey! Dean Whipple!

22:55.510 --> 22:58.354
Do you mind taking that
off for a minute?

23:01.808 --> 23:05.438
Thank you.
So my eyes have been opened.

23:05.604 --> 23:07.732
You know what I saw
when I looked around?

23:07.898 --> 23:11.528
Corn?
No. I saw you.

23:11.860 --> 23:15.989
I now know that every man
wants something to call his own.

23:16.155 --> 23:17.408
And with that in mind,

23:17.574 --> 23:21.454
I'm gonna give you the 200 acres
we got from the Pritchards.

23:21.620 --> 23:24.169
It'll be your own stake
in the family farm.

23:24.331 --> 23:26.879
One of these days,
your kids'll farm that land.

23:27.041 --> 23:28.714
Thought you got that for Grant.

23:28.876 --> 23:31.880
Well, Grant is out getting
God knows what kind of STDs

23:32.046 --> 23:34.925
from Argentinean girls.
You're here.

23:35.090 --> 23:38.560
I'm not staying here, Dad.
I'm racing cars.

23:40.888 --> 23:43.641
Racing cars is a great hobby.
You don't sponsor me.

23:43.807 --> 23:45.275
You sponsor Arthur Link.

23:45.434 --> 23:49.029
The Links have been buying
seeds from me for 10 years.

23:49.188 --> 23:51.816
You can't make money racing.
You can make money.

23:51.981 --> 23:53.028
Racing ARCA.

23:54.984 --> 23:58.114
Nick Elliott's recruiter
is coming to my next race.

23:58.280 --> 24:01.124
What?
Nick Elliott's coming to see you?

24:01.283 --> 24:02.955
Yeah. Me.

24:03.535 --> 24:05.583
When they hand out
that big check,

24:05.745 --> 24:09.250
guess whose name
is gonna be on it. Mine.

24:09.624 --> 24:13.925
You won't make it in the big leagues.
Just take the land. It's in your blood.

24:14.088 --> 24:16.931
Sooner you understand, the better.
I can't hear you.

24:17.091 --> 24:19.969
Gotta get this grain
to the elevator before they close.

24:38.069 --> 24:42.575
Honey, I'm paying a visit
to the Decatur traitors.

24:42.740 --> 24:44.583
Oh, Henry.

24:45.701 --> 24:48.205
Why don't you ask Cadence
to join you?

24:50.498 --> 24:54.173
Because she's a feral child.
She's a good kid and Dean likes her.

24:54.335 --> 24:57.214
Besides,
she could use a father figure.

25:00.590 --> 25:01.968
Hm.

25:09.182 --> 25:12.356
Do your parents care that
you lounge around here all day?

25:13.021 --> 25:14.613
Mom makes meth in Jefferson,

25:14.771 --> 25:17.991
my dad will be out
in 10 to 20. They're busy.

25:18.567 --> 25:20.285
Well, okay.

25:21.028 --> 25:23.702
Do you wanna come
sell seeds with me?

25:25.866 --> 25:29.416
Why don't you ask Dean?
I'm not asking Dean.

25:29.578 --> 25:33.833
I'm offering you an opportunity
to do something worthwhile.

25:34.623 --> 25:38.879
So put some clothes on, for God's
sakes, and I will see you in the car.

25:47.470 --> 25:49.940
This business is teeming
with life lessons

25:50.098 --> 25:53.397
for the next generation of Iowa,
Cadence.

25:53.559 --> 25:57.109
First lesson, loyalty.

25:57.271 --> 25:59.319
I have customers
in the seed business

25:59.482 --> 26:02.577
been with me since Dad was in charge.
And you know why?

26:02.736 --> 26:04.658
Because they're loyal.

26:04.820 --> 26:06.868
And I listen.

26:08.240 --> 26:13.963
Listening is another
great life lesson, Cadence.

26:14.121 --> 26:16.670
I listen to what my customers
have to say

26:16.832 --> 26:20.336
and in the end,
we'll find a solution

26:20.502 --> 26:23.052
for their next planting season.

26:23.463 --> 26:25.717
And this paves the road to success.

26:25.883 --> 26:28.385
And who doesn't wanna
be successful?

26:28.551 --> 26:30.428
So you have three L's:

26:30.596 --> 26:35.693
Loyalty, listening, equals solution.

26:35.851 --> 26:37.523
It's the key to happiness.

26:38.561 --> 26:40.984
So, what am I supposed
to do today?

26:41.147 --> 26:43.776
Your job is to sit back and learn.

26:44.610 --> 26:47.739
There's another L for you, see?

26:50.574 --> 26:52.622
Hey, have you had
your breakfast today?

26:52.784 --> 26:54.786
Most important meal of the day.

26:54.953 --> 26:57.126
Thanks, Henry.

27:01.876 --> 27:04.971
Is Kevin around?
Yup. He's out on the field.

27:05.130 --> 27:07.849
Because I wanted to talk to him
about his yields.

27:08.007 --> 27:10.635
You know, growing strong,
living long.

27:10.802 --> 27:13.429
Maybe, uh, talk about some
purchases for next season.

27:13.596 --> 27:16.314
That's not necessary.
I know it's not necessary,

27:16.474 --> 27:18.943
but it's just something
that I like to do.

27:19.143 --> 27:24.400
<i># I think I'll make it
Sooner or later #</i>

27:25.442 --> 27:30.163
# We all might make it
When I'm older N'

27:30.572 --> 27:33.996
I gotta break it to you, we're
going with Jim Johnson and Sons.

27:34.158 --> 27:38.914
Right, but I thought maybe if I
could just talk to Kevin in person...

27:39.079 --> 27:41.424
But he's out in the field.
Say hi to Irene.

27:41.582 --> 27:45.257
And we read about Grant in the paper.
The mountain thing.

27:45.419 --> 27:48.389
The mountain thing, that boy
is a real adventure seeker.

27:48.547 --> 27:51.676
We're really proud of him.
So are we. Bye, now.

27:51.842 --> 27:53.844
You have a good day.

27:59.265 --> 28:01.769
You in the mood for a Butter-finger?

28:02.478 --> 28:04.195
Give me one.

28:05.397 --> 28:08.866
Well, I'm glad you're happy
because I wanted to come over here,

28:09.025 --> 28:11.073
I wanted to check in with you.

28:11.235 --> 28:14.365
It seems there's been
some sort of switcheroo

28:14.531 --> 28:16.032
over here in Decatur.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.834
Yeah. I switched.
People say you're losing it.

28:18.993 --> 28:22.464
Actually, Henry's bringing bad
news, didn't know how to break it.

28:22.622 --> 28:25.125
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?

28:25.292 --> 28:28.841
You see, farms in this area have
had some switches in temperature

28:29.003 --> 28:32.303
and Henry wanted to walk
the fields with you to make sure

28:32.465 --> 28:34.467
everything was okay
with your crops.

28:34.634 --> 28:35.681
Who's this?

28:35.843 --> 28:38.062
I'm his intern. Cadence Farrow.

28:38.220 --> 28:41.350
Jim Johnson and Sons aren't here
walking the crops with you?

28:41.516 --> 28:44.018
Is that any way to treat
a customer?

28:44.727 --> 28:46.354
No, Cadence. It isn't.

28:46.521 --> 28:49.240
Well, sister, around here
we don't walk the crops,

28:49.398 --> 28:51.492
we ride them. Troy,

28:51.651 --> 28:53.528
get the mud hogs.

29:12.337 --> 29:15.682
You were good today, Cadence.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.592
Your job is like a game.

29:17.759 --> 29:21.138
You know, I used to think like
that too when I was starting out.

29:22.889 --> 29:26.564
Oh, can you actually drop me off
at 3rd Street? I'm meeting Dean.

29:29.604 --> 29:33.904
I guess he's got a lot going on
right now with his racing.

29:39.863 --> 29:41.241
What?

29:41.615 --> 29:44.869
Aren't you gonna ask me
to help you save Decatur again?

29:45.036 --> 29:47.788
Well, I thought
you already signed up.

29:57.423 --> 29:59.175
Hee-hoo.

30:04.763 --> 30:07.437
Cyclones star quarterback
Henry Whipple

30:07.600 --> 30:10.604
up against head cheerleader
Meredith Crown.

30:10.769 --> 30:13.318
He takes the ball.
Looks left, he fakes right,

30:13.480 --> 30:16.904
and then he scores a
touchdown right up the middle.

30:17.067 --> 30:19.490
Stoli O. That's my favorite.
Mm.

30:19.653 --> 30:22.953
We need to go back in and celebrate
the demise of Jim Johnson.

30:23.115 --> 30:24.866
I need two more customers

30:25.034 --> 30:27.036
and then Decatur will be mine.

30:27.202 --> 30:29.579
Oh, not so fast.
We have some negotiations.

30:29.746 --> 30:31.419
Oh, yeah, fast.
Heh, heh.

30:32.166 --> 30:34.588
Let's get some ice.
Okay.

30:36.211 --> 30:39.305
Wide Parisian boulevards
lead to famous landmarks.

30:39.464 --> 30:41.432
The Pantheon.

30:41.967 --> 30:43.218
The Old Opera.

30:43.384 --> 30:45.012
And the Arc de Triomphe.

30:45.178 --> 30:46.977
Evening, honey.

30:47.764 --> 30:51.769
Wouldn't it be nice to finally see Paris?
We could visit the wine vineyards.

30:51.934 --> 30:54.733
Maybe we should take a
vacation, just you and me.

30:54.896 --> 30:58.741
That would be nice.
We can't. Work calls.

31:00.151 --> 31:02.744
We could go during the
slow part of the season.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.998
Uh, something might happen.
It usually does.

31:05.156 --> 31:06.874
I'm going to bed.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.662
But you have time
to take off work for Meredith.

31:14.748 --> 31:17.297
I know you've been
sleeping with her.

31:18.211 --> 31:20.713
I don't know
who's been telling you what,

31:20.880 --> 31:22.722
but that is an out-and-out lie.

31:22.882 --> 31:26.511
And it's probably by people
who are jealous of us.

31:27.094 --> 31:29.267
I love you, Henry.

31:30.347 --> 31:34.068
And you make me feel
like an idiot for it every day.

31:58.499 --> 32:00.127
# Come on #

32:04.715 --> 32:08.093
# If you need a little rhythm
To shake away the blues #

32:08.259 --> 32:11.479
# If you wanna knock the shine
Off your brand-new shoes #

32:11.638 --> 32:14.642
<i># All you gotta do is leave
your troubles at the door #</i>

32:14.808 --> 32:17.435
# One thing I can tell you
You don't need 'em anymore #

32:17.602 --> 32:20.697
# Sing, hey
Hey oh #

32:20.855 --> 32:22.152
Whoo!

32:25.151 --> 32:26.949
Brian.

32:27.111 --> 32:29.614
- Donna, how are you?
- Fine, how are you?

32:29.780 --> 32:32.249
You got the whole family
out today?

32:32.408 --> 32:35.082
You having a good time?
What are you eating, a dog?

32:35.244 --> 32:38.248
We need you to come out
because it's that time of year:

32:38.413 --> 32:40.087
Customer Appreciation Day

32:40.249 --> 32:42.752
for being a great customer.
Bring the family.

32:42.918 --> 32:44.966
Yeah.
All our family will be there.

32:45.129 --> 32:47.598
The more the merrier.
It's good to see you.

32:47.757 --> 32:52.558
Thanks for being a great customer.
Have fun. Root for number 25.

32:53.178 --> 32:55.898
Good luck, man, I'll see you out there.
Thank you.

32:57.348 --> 33:01.023
Sorry to bother you. Would you mind
getting a photo with my brother?

33:01.227 --> 33:03.697
No. Come here, buddy.
He's a little shy.

33:03.855 --> 33:05.198
What's your name?
Keith.

33:05.356 --> 33:06.609
Keith, I'm Dean.
Hey.

33:06.775 --> 33:09.403
Really, he's like obsessed with you.

33:09.652 --> 33:10.869
Um...

33:15.617 --> 33:18.712
Um... Got it.

33:18.870 --> 33:20.543
Thank you.
And good luck today.

33:20.705 --> 33:23.629
Yeah. Nice to meet you, buddy.
Come on, Keith.

33:26.461 --> 33:27.713
Henry.

33:27.879 --> 33:31.098
Oh, hi, Jim.
I got a surprise call this morning

33:31.256 --> 33:33.476
from Alex Murphy in Decatur.
Oh.

33:33.635 --> 33:36.730
Told me that he wanted to switch
back to buying the seeds from you.

33:36.888 --> 33:39.767
Well, "switch back"
is a strong word, Jim.

33:39.932 --> 33:43.903
He just wanted to try a little
different strategy in his fields.

33:45.229 --> 33:48.824
Have to get paperwork approved from
the manager for purchase switch.

33:48.982 --> 33:51.952
Oh, worry not,
for approval I shall get.

33:52.110 --> 33:54.909
Now, if you'll pardon me, fine sir.

33:55.323 --> 33:57.120
Have a good day.

33:57.616 --> 33:59.789
Dean, Kyle. Recruiter
for Elliott Racing.

33:59.952 --> 34:01.169
Thanks for coming, man.

34:01.328 --> 34:03.831
You're figure-eight champion,
two years running.

34:03.997 --> 34:07.467
If I like what I see today, we'll
give you one and only one shot.

34:07.626 --> 34:08.627
Interesting.

34:08.793 --> 34:10.045
Race at the end of the month,

34:10.210 --> 34:12.088
and it'll cost you $15,000.

34:12.255 --> 34:13.882
$15,000, huh?
Oh, yeah, boy.

34:14.047 --> 34:15.891
I'm talking 10-person pit crew,

34:16.050 --> 34:18.018
trailers, tires, entrance fees

34:18.177 --> 34:20.556
and a whole mess of pussy.
Good luck.

34:20.722 --> 34:22.268
I'll be watching you.
Thanks.

34:22.431 --> 34:24.309
Come on, let's
grab some beers.

34:25.351 --> 34:28.356
You wanna indulge me as to
how you're gonna get $15,000?

34:28.522 --> 34:30.320
I got that saved in prize money.

34:30.482 --> 34:35.658
Dean, that is beer, beer and
abortion money, you know it.

34:35.820 --> 34:37.036
Sorry, Cadence.

34:37.197 --> 34:39.949
Ladies and gentlemen,
rise and remove your hats

34:40.116 --> 34:43.620
for the singing of the
national anthem.

34:43.953 --> 34:48.833
# O, say, can you see #

34:49.000 --> 34:53.129
# By the dawn's early light #

34:53.295 --> 34:57.893
# What so proudly we hailed #

34:58.049 --> 35:02.476
# At the twilight's last gleaming #

35:02.722 --> 35:07.478
# Whose broad stripes and bright stars #

35:07.643 --> 35:11.863
# Through the perilous fight #

35:12.022 --> 35:16.903
# O'er the ramparts we watched #

35:17.069 --> 35:21.494
# Were so gallantly streaming #

35:21.656 --> 35:25.287
# And the rocket's red glare #

35:25.785 --> 35:30.541
# The bombs bursting in air #

35:30.707 --> 35:34.462
# Gave proof through the night #

35:34.836 --> 35:39.933
# That our flag was still there #

35:40.559 --> 35:46.261
# O, say does that
Star-spangled banner #

35:46.805 --> 35:48.773
# Yet wave #

35:49.934 --> 35:55.567
# O'er the land of the free #

35:56.065 --> 36:01.733
# And the home of the brave #

36:05.699 --> 36:07.497
Whoo!

36:10.329 --> 36:12.297
Let's get started.

36:12.456 --> 36:15.710
Let's give our drivers
a round of applause.

36:23.217 --> 36:26.312
Let's keep our eyes open for 25,
Dean Whipple, today.

36:26.470 --> 36:29.895
He's been dominating
on this track all season.

36:37.856 --> 36:41.201
Whoa, whoa!
Jeez, Dean! This is insanity, Irene.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.909
Nobody would come watch
if there wasn't a crash.

36:45.823 --> 36:47.951
Brad Johnson, number 12,

36:48.117 --> 36:52.122
pulls ahead of number 25.
They've had a rivalry all season.

36:54.081 --> 36:55.879
These boys are going
neck and neck.

37:01.129 --> 37:02.255
Ooh! That's a rough one!

37:02.422 --> 37:05.848
Did you see that? Did you see that?
I saw it.

37:06.009 --> 37:07.010
The kid's a driver.

37:07.176 --> 37:10.225
I know.
He really is a driver.

37:12.306 --> 37:16.436
Brad Johnson is pulling up.
That's no love tap!

37:20.773 --> 37:22.649
Brad Johnson gets an inside line.

37:22.817 --> 37:25.696
You're going down, you fucking shit!
Hey, fuck you!

37:32.910 --> 37:35.583
Number 12 takes a tumble
as Whipple pulls ahead.

37:36.080 --> 37:38.833
Hope that Johnson boy
is all right in there.

37:39.458 --> 37:44.385
Ha-ha-ha. Did you see that?
What a move! Ha, ha!

37:45.005 --> 37:49.010
Dean Whipple straightens out
and sails through the final lap.

37:50.803 --> 37:54.727
It's no surprise here, fans.
The winner is Dean Whipple!

37:55.098 --> 37:56.896
It's official.

38:00.103 --> 38:02.356
Yeah!
Number one, baby!

38:02.522 --> 38:05.992
Brad's up and walking. It doesn't
look like he's a happy camper.

38:06.151 --> 38:07.619
Where is that motherfucker?

38:07.778 --> 38:10.998
Hey, what the fuck, man?
Look at that shit!

38:11.156 --> 38:13.659
Go flip your car over.
Unjust shit you pulled!

38:13.825 --> 38:16.418
The fuck's your problem?
Fuck's your problem?

38:16.578 --> 38:19.205
What the fuck?
You piece of shit.

38:19.413 --> 38:21.211
Fuck you!

38:25.587 --> 38:27.964
Get him, Dean! Come on.
Hey, hey, hey.

38:31.635 --> 38:34.605
Fucking asshole, fuck
you, you piece of shit!

38:35.012 --> 38:38.061
The Whipples are a bunch
of pussies! Fuck you!

38:38.224 --> 38:40.603
Come on. Come on, man.

38:40.768 --> 38:42.896
Piece of shit. It's my track!

38:43.062 --> 38:46.942
We know who won. We know
who won. We know who won.

38:47.108 --> 38:49.361
Number one!
Dean, Dean!

38:49.527 --> 38:52.121
Dean, Dean, Dean!
Yeah!

38:52.321 --> 38:54.244
All right!

38:54.990 --> 38:57.789
Number one, baby!
Number one!

38:57.952 --> 39:01.547
Congratulations, Dean Whipple!

39:01.747 --> 39:04.340
Thank you, I appreciate that.
Ride with us.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.297
I want to, man, count me in.

39:06.460 --> 39:09.885
Garage sale, some great finds.
I can try, man.

39:10.046 --> 39:12.299
My sister was your
high school teacher.

39:12.466 --> 39:14.764
Was she? Yeah, I remember.
Thank you, ma'am.

39:14.926 --> 39:16.974
That was impressive
on the track today.

39:17.137 --> 39:19.310
Henry Whipple's son?
Don't remind me.

39:19.473 --> 39:21.975
I'm Meredith.
And I'm his girlfriend.

39:22.142 --> 39:24.861
Hi. We're gonna meet people
at Slipper's for drinks.

39:25.019 --> 39:27.364
Do you wanna join us?
Oh, how old are you?

39:27.522 --> 39:30.446
Actually, don't tell me.
I don't wanna feel old.

39:31.568 --> 39:34.742
You wouldn't wanna leave
your girl alone on this big night.

39:35.113 --> 39:37.036
All right.
Another time.

39:37.198 --> 39:38.791
Come on.

39:38.950 --> 39:40.372
Good night.

39:43.705 --> 39:45.628
She was pretty.

39:45.957 --> 39:47.925
I didn't notice.

39:48.083 --> 39:49.427
There he is.
Yep.

39:49.586 --> 39:50.838
Hey.

39:51.003 --> 39:55.510
Dean. Hey, Dean, that was amazing.
Just amazing! Wow!

39:55.675 --> 39:58.349
Ah, it's no big deal.
Ha, ha. No big deal?

39:58.511 --> 40:01.684
Hey, get changed and
let's all go out and celebrate.

40:01.847 --> 40:03.566
Oh, thanks. I got plans.

40:03.724 --> 40:07.604
Well, break them.
Heck, this is important.

40:07.769 --> 40:09.191
Dad, I can't.

40:09.355 --> 40:12.404
I get these every weekend.
Here, you can have this one.

40:13.066 --> 40:15.286
Bye, Mom.
Bye. Good job.

40:15.444 --> 40:16.787
Hey, Dean.

40:19.781 --> 40:22.079
I was proud of you out there.

40:23.660 --> 40:25.161
Thanks, Dad.

40:25.329 --> 40:28.253
Whoo! Going to ARCA, baby!
Ha-ha-ha.

40:28.415 --> 40:30.167
Come on, Henry.

40:30.334 --> 40:32.632
Dean, congratulations.

40:32.794 --> 40:34.717
Look at that.

40:34.921 --> 40:37.094
Dean, hey, here, here.

40:38.550 --> 40:39.846
Cheers, fellas.
Cheers.

41:46.908 --> 41:51.914
Would you ever cheat on your wife?
No. No, ma'am.

41:53.164 --> 41:55.918
I don't think
I'm glamorous enough for Dean.

41:57.836 --> 42:01.591
Sometimes guys get distracted
by girls with big...

42:01.756 --> 42:05.226
Racks?
Personalities.

42:05.385 --> 42:07.183
Jeez.

42:07.971 --> 42:10.224
Do you think that's
what Dean wants?

42:10.974 --> 42:13.272
No. That car...

42:13.726 --> 42:16.479
it was behind us last time.

42:37.792 --> 42:38.917
Good afternoon.

42:39.084 --> 42:42.714
I couldn't help notice that you fine
gentlemen have been tailing me.

42:42.880 --> 42:46.601
Henry Whipple? That's me.
Don't wear it out. Ha-ha-ha.

42:46.759 --> 42:48.432
By purchasing Liberty seeds,

42:48.594 --> 42:52.440
you signed an agreement that gives
us the right to inspect your crops.

42:52.597 --> 42:55.272
What's this all about?
Let's cut to the chase.

42:55.434 --> 42:58.404
We've been investigating you
on their behalf.

42:58.896 --> 43:00.693
What?
And we got a tip

43:00.898 --> 43:03.947
that you've been cleaning
and reusing their seeds.

43:04.109 --> 43:05.827
Well, who gave you this tip?

43:05.986 --> 43:08.204
We need to visit your fields,
take samples.

43:08.363 --> 43:09.707
When would be a good time?

43:11.115 --> 43:12.789
No time's a good time.

43:12.951 --> 43:17.296
You gave up that right, Mr. Whipple.
Now, when would be a good time?

43:19.916 --> 43:21.418
Um...

43:24.420 --> 43:26.093
Saturday?

43:26.297 --> 43:27.514
Saturday it is.

43:27.674 --> 43:29.721
You make sure you're there.

43:46.818 --> 43:49.822
Didn't know Publishers Clearing
House wanted to find you.

43:49.987 --> 43:52.831
How much did you win?
Not now, Cadence.

43:53.365 --> 43:55.163
What is it?

43:58.955 --> 44:01.754
Here's another life lesson for you.

44:02.165 --> 44:07.593
Farmers used to save and clean
natural seeds after each harvest

44:07.754 --> 44:11.510
and then they'd plant them
again the next season.

44:11.675 --> 44:13.393
So?

44:13.553 --> 44:19.184
Well, uh, it's illegal to do that with
genetically-modified seeds like Liberty.

44:19.349 --> 44:22.193
You have to buy
new seeds each year.

44:22.352 --> 44:23.945
Why?

44:24.855 --> 44:28.324
Because companies like Liberty
pay scientists big money

44:28.483 --> 44:31.032
to develop these GMOs

44:31.193 --> 44:35.323
to make them stronger
so they'll produce bigger yields,

44:35.490 --> 44:37.788
and Liberty has patented
these seeds.

44:39.076 --> 44:42.080
So kind of like bootlegging DVDs?

44:42.246 --> 44:46.376
Yes. But there's a lot more money
at stake here.

44:46.959 --> 44:51.135
These guys didn't just copyright
movies, they copyrighted life.

44:56.886 --> 44:59.390
And you reused Liberty seeds,
didn't you?

45:21.075 --> 45:22.703
- Hey, Janet.
- Hey, Henry.

45:22.870 --> 45:24.917
Byron around?
He's over there.

45:31.961 --> 45:35.682
If they find out,
I'll lose everything.

45:35.840 --> 45:40.971
You said you had two ways to go:
stay the same or get bigger.

45:43.181 --> 45:45.229
You needed cash
to buy more land,

45:45.975 --> 45:49.570
and reselling GMO seeds
was your only option.

45:51.314 --> 45:56.491
You didn't talk, did you?
Of course not. I'm in this with you.

45:58.363 --> 45:59.956
Byron.

46:00.240 --> 46:04.290
I cleaned natural seeds
for your father on this machine

46:04.452 --> 46:07.626
that I built with my own hands.

46:08.248 --> 46:11.377
I was at your high school
football games, Henry.

46:11.543 --> 46:13.637
And your sons' too.

46:13.794 --> 46:15.638
I know.

46:16.713 --> 46:19.467
I'm sorry. I just...

46:21.593 --> 46:23.891
Who could have done this?

46:32.312 --> 46:35.737
You didn't reuse seeds
in your own fields, did you?

46:37.401 --> 46:39.449
Do I look like a fool?

46:39.611 --> 46:43.115
And the agents are only
checking your fields, right?

46:43.699 --> 46:45.246
Right.

46:46.535 --> 46:49.835
So they won't find
anything there.

46:49.996 --> 46:51.998
You'll be fine.

46:52.165 --> 46:55.008
It'll blow over
like most storms.

46:56.461 --> 46:58.883
Yeah. Come on.

47:34.123 --> 47:36.875
What's this?
It's for you.

47:43.299 --> 47:48.100
Fifteen thousand dollars to
Nick Elliott Racing? Mom, no.

47:48.262 --> 47:50.514
From my account,
Dad doesn't have to know.

47:50.680 --> 47:54.151
Mom, what are you doing?
It'll be our secret.

47:54.684 --> 47:57.108
Fifteen thousand dollars.
Ha-ha-ha.

47:57.270 --> 47:59.773
Thanks, Morn.
Thank you.

48:39.269 --> 48:41.113
Set it up right.

48:55.661 --> 48:59.712
This track is seven-eighths of a mile,
the compound banking makes it fast.

48:59.873 --> 49:03.423
Now, that's the safety barrier,
but I promise you it's gonna hurt

49:03.585 --> 49:07.306
when you hit that 180 miles an hour.
So keep it straight, all right?

49:07.464 --> 49:09.636
Pay attention to your pit boards.
Right.

49:09.800 --> 49:11.517
Look for me
on warm-up laps,

49:11.677 --> 49:13.805
hit your mark every stop.
I'm serious.

49:13.971 --> 49:16.439
Screw up in the pits,
kiss your chance goodbye.

49:16.597 --> 49:18.565
This ain't no
figure-eight race, boy.

49:22.855 --> 49:26.324
Okay. That finishes that.
What did you get from that side?

49:26.482 --> 49:28.405
- Twelve.
- Twelve. From this side?

49:28.568 --> 49:30.913
- Eight.
- Enough? Are those the last'?

49:31.070 --> 49:34.415
- Yeah, should be.
- Are you done over there?

49:34.575 --> 49:38.751
That's it. Let's go. Wrap it up,
we're done. You two, let's go.

49:39.078 --> 49:40.876
Oh, and, uh, Mr. Whipple?

49:41.414 --> 49:43.257
Yeah.
There's one other thing.

49:43.416 --> 49:45.714
We broadened this case
to the possibility

49:45.877 --> 49:49.632
of you reselling Liberty seeds.
We need to access your invoices

49:49.797 --> 49:53.222
for the past three years.
Okay.

49:53.885 --> 49:57.014
My wife does the books.
You're gonna have to give us time

49:57.180 --> 50:00.775
to get that together.
How about...? Next week.

50:00.933 --> 50:03.106
Oh, and good luck to your son.

50:03.435 --> 50:05.689
I understand he's quite
the driver.

50:08.900 --> 50:10.573
Starting in the 26th position

50:11.067 --> 50:13.991
in the black number 11
for Fast-Track Racing,

50:14.154 --> 50:18.250
from southern Iowa,
Dean Whipple!

50:20.076 --> 50:22.204
Have a good race.
Thank you.

50:25.916 --> 50:28.260
Thank you.
Thanks for driving with us.

50:28.419 --> 50:29.715
Thank you, sir.

51:07.998 --> 51:09.796
Let's go, son!
Go, Dean!

51:17.883 --> 51:20.602
Oh, hey. There he is.
Hey.

51:20.845 --> 51:22.518
Hey!

51:24.265 --> 51:25.687
Hee-hoo.

51:26.934 --> 51:29.403
Go get him.
You can do it, son.

51:47.954 --> 51:50.299
Gentlemen, start your engines!

52:03.803 --> 52:07.979
Whoo! Come on! Get it, son!
Ha-ha-ha.

52:14.314 --> 52:16.112
Look at him!

52:17.150 --> 52:18.992
Go, son! Whoo!

52:19.152 --> 52:20.654
You can do it. Come on.

52:20.820 --> 52:23.868
All right, you're looking good, kid.
Just hit your marks.

52:41.341 --> 52:44.014
Dean! Push him out of the way.
Come on.

52:55.021 --> 52:57.773
What's up with this guy?
Goddamn it, kid, focus!

52:57.940 --> 53:01.786
You knock the fender off that thing,
you're gonna have a bad day.

53:02.569 --> 53:03.786
What the fuck, man?

53:03.945 --> 53:06.995
Did you see that? Did you see that?

53:13.455 --> 53:15.002
Come on, man! Come on!

53:21.296 --> 53:22.797
You gotta pick it up. Now!

53:54.620 --> 53:56.463
Goddamn you, kid!

54:26.526 --> 54:28.403
Hey, son.

54:28.570 --> 54:29.992
Hey.

54:30.280 --> 54:32.408
You should be proud.
You ran a good race.

54:32.574 --> 54:34.247
Don't say that.
Held your own.

54:34.409 --> 54:36.002
I'll get on the phone...
Dad!

54:36.202 --> 54:40.298
What are you trying to do? Come back
into my life now because I lose?

54:41.249 --> 54:44.423
I put myself in those cars
so I don't have to talk to you.

54:44.585 --> 54:47.429
Grant's lucky. He left because
he couldn't stand you.

54:47.588 --> 54:51.219
Shut up, shut up. Not true.
Why do you think he's on a mountain?

54:51.383 --> 54:53.602
And never calls?
Dean.

54:59.017 --> 55:00.644
Forget it.
Yeah. Forget it.

55:00.810 --> 55:02.778
It's not worth it.

55:06.231 --> 55:08.279
Don't you have your own family?

55:16.200 --> 55:19.204
Hey, fuck it, man. Right?

55:19.620 --> 55:21.418
Let's kick rocks.

55:26.542 --> 55:28.841
Irene. How long
were you gonna wait

55:29.254 --> 55:32.427
before you told me
about the $15,000?

55:34.218 --> 55:37.768
Cadence, this is addressed to Dean.
Will you run and give it to him?

55:37.930 --> 55:39.523
Not sure he wants
any company.

55:39.681 --> 55:42.776
I'm sure he does.
He's out at the second farm.

55:45.436 --> 55:49.316
My son has always wanted to be a race
car driver and that was my money.

55:49.483 --> 55:52.156
That was family money.
No, it's mine.

55:52.318 --> 55:55.868
From my personal account,
so I used it for him.

56:01.702 --> 56:04.876
Why can't you be happy with
what's right in front of you?

56:29.980 --> 56:32.074
Need a hand?
No, kid.

56:32.232 --> 56:35.031
I gotta do this myself.

56:36.820 --> 56:39.449
All right, well, urn,
see you later.

56:39.615 --> 56:41.662
See you later.

57:08.100 --> 57:09.273
Aw.

58:32.767 --> 58:35.940
Oh, my God. Ha-ha-ha.

58:37.522 --> 58:39.741
I lost my shoe.

59:55.431 --> 59:58.184
Hi, Dean, from base camp.
Headed for the summit.

59:58.351 --> 01:00:01.946
Freezing winds and tons of snow.
Wish me luck.

01:00:02.104 --> 01:00:03.981
Hope you're tearing up the tracks.

01:00:04.148 --> 01:00:06.742
We'll race for beers at Archie's
when I get back.

01:00:06.901 --> 01:00:08.244
Love you.

01:00:08.652 --> 01:00:10.370
Grant.

01:01:39.867 --> 01:01:43.872
Cadence brought these flowers.
Don't they look pretty?

01:01:44.037 --> 01:01:46.256
Can you ask her
not to come anymore?

01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:48.880
You're just tired.

01:01:49.042 --> 01:01:51.636
I'm not tired, I'm thinking.

01:01:55.757 --> 01:01:57.725
You need anything?

01:02:12.899 --> 01:02:15.652
You wanna explain to me
what's going on?

01:02:16.152 --> 01:02:18.325
I don't know where I
went wrong with Dean.

01:02:18.489 --> 01:02:22.618
No, no, no, not Dean. Dean's a kid.
He'll bounce back.

01:02:22.783 --> 01:02:24.751
I'm talking about the farm.

01:02:26.204 --> 01:02:27.877
What about it?

01:02:28.039 --> 01:02:31.589
I don't know what shit you're
trodding through with these agents,

01:02:31.751 --> 01:02:36.598
but you better get out of it.
Don't you lose what my daddy started.

01:02:36.756 --> 01:02:40.511
Dad, do you remember
when we had chickens and cattle?

01:02:40.676 --> 01:02:43.019
No.
Oh, come on.

01:02:43.178 --> 01:02:45.398
During the harvest,
kids would come over

01:02:45.556 --> 01:02:48.980
and we'd bale hay on wagons.
Yes. Of course I remember.

01:02:49.142 --> 01:02:52.317
I remember it was backbreaking work.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.948
Things like this
wouldn't happen back then.

01:02:56.149 --> 01:02:59.245
Those times, they were so simple.

01:02:59.403 --> 01:03:01.575
Let me tell you what simple is.

01:03:01.738 --> 01:03:04.491
It's a 48 row planter,
with air conditioning

01:03:04.658 --> 01:03:06.956
that drives itself with GPS.

01:03:07.118 --> 01:03:10.338
Oh, yeah, things are better now.

01:03:10.497 --> 01:03:14.502
And how you got into this mess
is beyond me.

01:03:14.668 --> 01:03:18.548
You better get off your ass
and make things right.

01:03:18.713 --> 01:03:21.011
Do you hear me?

01:03:23.385 --> 01:03:25.183
Yes, sir.

01:04:57.143 --> 01:05:01.273
Welcome home, son. Found this baby
parked in the driveway this morning.

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:02.815
It's got your name on it.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.784
The Dean Whipple
red mean machine.

01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:11.912
Torgeson helped me find this thing.
It's got a 421 Chevy engine in it.

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:14.248
It's got a 350 turbo transmission.

01:05:14.409 --> 01:05:16.411
It's got a Ford 9-inch
rear-end

01:05:16.578 --> 01:05:20.253
and a whole bunch of other stuff I
don't even know anything about.

01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:23.255
What do you think? You like it?

01:05:24.711 --> 01:05:26.384
Thanks, Dad.

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:29.975
Could you take it back?
Take it back?

01:05:30.133 --> 01:05:33.012
I thought that you and I
could work on this together.

01:05:33.428 --> 01:05:34.930
No, I'm not racing anymore.

01:05:36.306 --> 01:05:39.936
When you fall off a horse,
the best thing you do is get back on it.

01:05:40.143 --> 01:05:42.736
Look, I politely asked you,
please take it back.

01:06:01.748 --> 01:06:04.922
Hey.

01:06:05.961 --> 01:06:07.759
Thanks, Morn.

01:06:07.921 --> 01:06:10.048
You need anything else?

01:06:10.506 --> 01:06:12.053
No, I'm good.

01:06:12.967 --> 01:06:15.095
Those the guys
Granddad talked about?

01:06:15.261 --> 01:06:16.308
I don't know.

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:19.565
Are you kidding me?
Hey, hey, let Dad handle it.

01:06:29.358 --> 01:06:31.736
Hey, there. I wasn't
expecting you guys today.

01:06:31.902 --> 01:06:33.494
Surprise.
What do you want'?

01:06:33.654 --> 01:06:35.782
Dean, just go back inside.
Who is this?

01:06:35.948 --> 01:06:38.291
Who am I?
Who the hell are you, asshole?

01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:39.748
Watch your mouth.
Hey.

01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:42.503
You pushing us around?
We'll examine your invoices.

01:06:42.663 --> 01:06:45.415
Have a warrant?
Mr. Whipple is aware of our rights.

01:06:45.583 --> 01:06:47.585
We'll go inside
and we'll handle this...

01:06:47.752 --> 01:06:51.677
They don't have a warrant. Fuck them.
Whipple, ask this person to leave.

01:06:51.839 --> 01:06:56.640
Dean, that's enough. Dean, go in...
Hey! Dean! Dean! Stop it!

01:06:56.802 --> 01:06:58.178
Stop it!
This person

01:06:58.344 --> 01:07:01.724
is telling you to take a hike.
What is wrong with you?

01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:04.565
We can handle this
another time. Give me a call.

01:07:04.726 --> 01:07:06.148
Handle it with no trouble.

01:07:06.311 --> 01:07:09.815
There's an easier way to do this.
I haven't done anything wrong.

01:07:09.981 --> 01:07:13.531
I don't know why we keep bending
over backwards for these assholes.

01:07:14.235 --> 01:07:16.988
Will you just calm down?
I'll handle this.

01:07:17.155 --> 01:07:20.328
You can't do things like that, Dean.

01:08:47.285 --> 01:08:49.082
Come on.

01:08:49.828 --> 01:08:51.502
Why?

01:08:51.747 --> 01:08:54.796
I don't know, it's fun.
All right.

01:08:57.167 --> 01:08:59.466
Shit.
Shit. Go, go, go.

01:09:01.674 --> 01:09:03.721
Hey, come here.

01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:06.638
Hey. You're a real gem,
you know that?

01:09:06.803 --> 01:09:10.103
I'm gonna get the cops on you so
you can join your dad in jail.

01:09:10.265 --> 01:09:13.769
Find your own boyfriend, old whore.
Cadence, come on.

01:09:36.541 --> 01:09:38.714
I told him never
to come here.

01:09:41.171 --> 01:09:45.220
Why am I getting calls from Meredith
saying you're tearing up her house?

01:09:45.425 --> 01:09:49.350
I don't know. Ask her.
I want this to work out. I do.

01:09:49.511 --> 01:09:52.014
If Meredith... If she's
telling you to fuck her

01:09:52.182 --> 01:09:53.683
in a cornfield somewhere.

01:09:56.478 --> 01:09:58.821
I don't want this to work out.

01:09:58.979 --> 01:10:03.326
I don't need anybody to take care
of me or ask me where I am at night.

01:10:04.568 --> 01:10:06.662
I'm not sad about it.

01:10:07.529 --> 01:10:11.659
I don't think it's good anymore.
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:10:11.825 --> 01:10:14.419
I got bigger holes in my shoes
to be dealing with.

01:10:14.578 --> 01:10:16.546
Go fix your holes, then.

01:10:17.081 --> 01:10:19.425
Wait. Do you even know
what's happening now?

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:23.133
Dad won't get a lawyer.
He's guilty of cleaning those seeds.

01:10:23.295 --> 01:10:26.765
He didn't wanna tell you before your race.
Wait, what? Sorry, what?

01:10:29.677 --> 01:10:32.430
He didn't wanna tell you
before your big race.

01:10:35.182 --> 01:10:37.025
We'll lose everything.

01:10:37.809 --> 01:10:41.530
I've got coffee in the microwave.
It's getting cold.

01:10:42.522 --> 01:10:44.490
Cadence, wait.

01:10:45.692 --> 01:10:47.660
It's Byron, isn't it?

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:50.446
Go help your dad out.

01:10:51.364 --> 01:10:53.241
He loves you a lot.

01:11:16.014 --> 01:11:18.813
Hi, Dean. What's up?
Call the agents off.

01:11:18.975 --> 01:11:20.977
Hey.
Right now. You hear me?

01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:24.239
Look, let's go talk in the barn.

01:11:24.646 --> 01:11:27.525
It's okay, dear.
Everything's all right.

01:11:27.691 --> 01:11:29.990
Call Liberty,
tell them you made a mistake.

01:11:30.153 --> 01:11:31.826
But I didn't...

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:37.244
Henry and I are both guilty.
If I reported him, I'd be in trouble too.

01:11:37.409 --> 01:11:39.788
Well, who reported us'?
I don't know.

01:11:40.412 --> 01:11:42.289
Who was it?
I don't know.

01:11:42.456 --> 01:11:44.584
Tell me who it was!

01:11:44.751 --> 01:11:48.425
Big farmers are very aggressive,
and your dad made a lot of enemies.

01:11:48.587 --> 01:11:51.511
And there's this guy...
Jim Johnson.

01:11:51.965 --> 01:11:54.263
It was Jim Johnson, wasn't it?

01:12:23.245 --> 01:12:24.997
What is it?

01:12:25.749 --> 01:12:29.720
Dean knows. He just left my place.
Did he say where he was going?

01:12:29.877 --> 01:12:32.175
Henry.
Oh, goddamn, Dean.

01:12:32.338 --> 01:12:35.012
I know what he's going through.
If Grant was here...

01:12:35.174 --> 01:12:37.768
Will you shut up about Grant!

01:12:38.302 --> 01:12:40.475
Those days are gone.

01:12:41.639 --> 01:12:43.562
I'm the one to blame.

01:12:47.561 --> 01:12:49.984
It was me, Henry.

01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:08.256
I've been a seed cleaner
my whole life.

01:13:08.414 --> 01:13:10.257
Now my kids
have to send me money

01:13:10.416 --> 01:13:12.545
so I can make it
through each month.

01:13:12.711 --> 01:13:14.759
Well, why didn't you ask me?

01:13:16.465 --> 01:13:18.341
I did.

01:13:19.008 --> 01:13:20.806
I asked you for work, remember?

01:13:22.011 --> 01:13:23.934
You wouldn't listen.

01:13:24.097 --> 01:13:27.226
So you went and made a deal
with Liberty Seeds, is that it?

01:13:27.434 --> 01:13:28.605
No.

01:13:29.477 --> 01:13:30.979
I didn't report you.

01:13:31.479 --> 01:13:32.651
Well, you just said...

01:13:32.814 --> 01:13:37.536
Some guy came snooping around a few
weeks back and got to talking.

01:13:38.486 --> 01:13:40.237
About you.

01:13:40.405 --> 01:13:42.327
He offered me money.

01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:44.913
Who?

01:13:45.493 --> 01:13:48.166
Who was it? I just couldn't refuse.

01:13:52.166 --> 01:13:53.589
Larry Brown.

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.878
What do you want, man?

01:14:36.501 --> 01:14:40.222
Tell your dad to call off
the agents. Call them off!

01:14:40.672 --> 01:14:42.390
What's your problem?

01:14:48.930 --> 01:14:50.728
Call them off!

01:15:02.777 --> 01:15:04.245
Come on!

01:15:22.171 --> 01:15:24.844
Is that what it felt like
to lose ARCA, pussy?

01:15:26.633 --> 01:15:28.761
Is that what it felt like to lose?

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:42.109
Come on, get up! Get up!

01:15:48.321 --> 01:15:49.995
Come on!

01:16:38.412 --> 01:16:41.006
- Afternoon.
- Hi.

01:16:41.165 --> 01:16:45.170
Heat getting to you?
Doing all right, thanks.

01:16:46.211 --> 01:16:47.884
Hi, there.

01:16:48.422 --> 01:16:49.969
Are you Larry Brown?

01:16:50.132 --> 01:16:53.386
I thought I'd be too small for
a shark like you to remember.

01:16:53.551 --> 01:16:55.679
Oh, I don't know about that.

01:16:55.846 --> 01:16:58.689
I'm Henry Whipple.
I know who you are.

01:16:58.849 --> 01:17:00.646
"Whipple wants you. "

01:17:00.934 --> 01:17:04.188
Impossible not to smell
your shit from a mile away.

01:17:05.605 --> 01:17:08.233
Uh, look, uh...

01:17:08.399 --> 01:17:11.950
I just came over here
to talk things over with you.

01:17:12.111 --> 01:17:13.704
You're in trouble, aren't you?

01:17:13.864 --> 01:17:18.118
Listen, Larry.
Uh, Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown.

01:17:20.536 --> 01:17:24.166
I need you to call off
those Liberty agents.

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.008
You ruined me.

01:17:26.167 --> 01:17:28.841
I don't even know
what I've done to you.

01:17:29.003 --> 01:17:30.755
Well, let me refresh your memory.

01:17:30.922 --> 01:17:33.425
You bought my land
at the Pritchard's funeral.

01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:35.719
I'd been renting that land
for 10 years.

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:38.058
Me. Larry Brown.

01:17:38.221 --> 01:17:41.440
And you took it away
from me and my family.

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:47.237
Well, I bought that land
fair and square.

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:49.273
Legally.

01:17:49.857 --> 01:17:52.325
And you've got...
I've got nothing!

01:17:52.484 --> 01:17:56.079
I had 480 acres and
you took 200 of them.

01:17:56.488 --> 01:17:58.912
You're smart enough
to know what you've done.

01:17:59.074 --> 01:18:01.293
You put me out of business.

01:18:02.035 --> 01:18:04.538
"Expand or die," they say.

01:18:04.705 --> 01:18:07.207
Well, you killed me off good.

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:11.929
But I still own this land
you're standing on,

01:18:12.504 --> 01:18:15.132
and I suggest you leave.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.013
Good afternoon, ma'am.

01:18:26.017 --> 01:18:27.769
Hey, buddy.

01:18:53.752 --> 01:18:55.254
Hello.

01:18:56.755 --> 01:18:58.302
Dean?

01:18:59.675 --> 01:19:01.143
What?

01:19:02.928 --> 01:19:04.646
Where are you?

01:19:23.114 --> 01:19:24.833
Dean!

01:19:27.076 --> 01:19:28.874
Dean!

01:19:31.915 --> 01:19:33.338
Dean!

01:19:37.754 --> 01:19:39.882
Dean, God.

01:19:40.882 --> 01:19:43.260
Dean, you all right?

01:19:45.094 --> 01:19:47.017
What happened?

01:20:25.509 --> 01:20:26.556
Is he dead?

01:20:37.729 --> 01:20:39.231
It was an accident.

01:22:55.406 --> 01:22:56.908
Ah.

01:23:29.188 --> 01:23:32.784
Have you noticed Dad's been out
three mornings in a row?

01:23:32.942 --> 01:23:34.068
No, I didn't notice.

01:24:13.649 --> 01:24:14.821
Henry.

01:24:18.069 --> 01:24:19.572
Hi.

01:24:19.739 --> 01:24:22.742
I'm leaving, Whipple.
Going out west.

01:24:23.366 --> 01:24:25.744
I might put you as a reference
if that's okay.

01:24:25.911 --> 01:24:28.630
So be expecting some calls.
Of course.

01:24:28.789 --> 01:24:31.759
Give them my number.
I'll sing your praises.

01:24:33.126 --> 01:24:34.673
Henry...

01:24:35.587 --> 01:24:36.839
Um...

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:39.258
I just wanna thank you.

01:24:39.758 --> 01:24:42.136
While it was fun, I had fun,
you know?

01:24:51.561 --> 01:24:53.609
Oh, and make sure
and get Decatur back.

01:24:53.772 --> 01:24:56.945
You still have a month before
Customer Appreciation Day.

01:25:00.779 --> 01:25:04.354
In times of despair
and confusion,

01:25:04.772 --> 01:25:07.329
it is important to have hope.

01:25:08.453 --> 01:25:10.830
As lost sheep in the
eyes of our Lord,

01:25:10.996 --> 01:25:12.748
we need guidance

01:25:12.957 --> 01:25:18.305
in the face of the unknown
and uncertain future.

01:25:18.462 --> 01:25:20.885
Let us not become weary
in doing good,

01:25:21.048 --> 01:25:26.929
for at the proper time we will reap
a harvest if we do not give up.

01:25:27.721 --> 01:25:29.188
Galatians 6:9.

01:25:29.348 --> 01:25:32.602
The agents have examined
and cleared my invoices,

01:25:32.768 --> 01:25:35.111
and they say that it's all up to you.

01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:38.900
This contract has everything
that you asked for.

01:25:39.065 --> 01:25:43.321
You can rent and work the land
free of charge, as a tenant.

01:25:43.487 --> 01:25:45.238
For life.

01:25:47.115 --> 01:25:49.868
Now, will you call off the agents?

01:26:05.008 --> 01:26:07.136
God may not answer immediately,

01:26:07.302 --> 01:26:11.853
but we will all be given that which
we are due in the eyes of the Lord.

01:26:13.349 --> 01:26:15.852
For better or for worse.

01:26:16.018 --> 01:26:20.023
But when the time is right,
God will act.

01:26:20.607 --> 01:26:24.237
He will hold his hand out to you.

01:26:24.402 --> 01:26:25.528
So keep hope...

01:26:25.695 --> 01:26:28.698
- Is he all right?
- ... close to your heart.

01:26:29.490 --> 01:26:33.585
And now please, rise and join me
in the Lord's Prayer.

01:26:34.745 --> 01:26:37.089
Our Father, who art in heaven,

01:26:37.248 --> 01:26:42.754
hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:45.389
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:26:46.048 --> 01:26:49.178
Give us this day our daily bread,

01:26:49.343 --> 01:26:51.391
and forgive us our trespasses...

01:26:51.553 --> 01:26:52.645
Brad!

01:26:52.804 --> 01:26:55.899
As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:26:57.267 --> 01:27:00.396
And lead us not into temptation,

01:27:00.896 --> 01:27:02.897
but deliver us from evil.

01:27:03.690 --> 01:27:09.288
For thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory,

01:27:09.446 --> 01:27:12.995
forever and ever. Amen.

01:27:17.287 --> 01:27:19.960
This is Iowa. Right here
you can see Green County.

01:27:20.123 --> 01:27:22.625
And this right here,
you recognize this?

01:27:22.792 --> 01:27:24.794
That's your property.
That's your farm.

01:27:24.961 --> 01:27:27.635
Zoom in. Right here,
your soil temperatures.

01:27:28.131 --> 01:27:32.636
Very specific. Up to the minute.
Very cutting-edge. Over your property.

01:27:32.802 --> 01:27:35.396
This is right now,
as we stand here.

01:27:36.847 --> 01:27:39.817
This is us right here.

01:27:45.773 --> 01:27:47.366
Jim.

01:27:49.568 --> 01:27:51.195
Jim.

01:27:52.571 --> 01:27:54.949
I am so sorry.

01:27:56.492 --> 01:27:58.335
I, uh...

01:27:59.744 --> 01:28:01.746
I want to tell you something.

01:28:01.914 --> 01:28:05.043
No. There's nothing to say,
Henry.

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:08.088
We're still hopeful.

01:28:08.879 --> 01:28:13.258
But I know that with each day
that goes by, it's less likely that...

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:19.394
When he was little,
I would tell him,

01:28:19.974 --> 01:28:22.271
as long as I was alive,

01:28:22.434 --> 01:28:24.778
nothing could happen to him.

01:28:35.196 --> 01:28:37.664
Jim, we're so sorry
to hear about your son.

01:28:37.824 --> 01:28:40.293
That's very kind of you, Bobbie.

01:28:41.327 --> 01:28:44.251
You're in our prayers, Jim.
Okay.

01:28:48.667 --> 01:28:51.797
I wanna say that, um...

01:28:55.591 --> 01:29:00.940
What I wanna say is that I just
got back from Decatur with Dean.

01:29:01.096 --> 01:29:04.692
And he took an order
for next season

01:29:04.851 --> 01:29:08.229
from a customer of yours,
Wilbur Bastian.

01:29:08.395 --> 01:29:10.147
Oh, well...

01:29:10.314 --> 01:29:14.285
Right, Wilbur.
He's called me a couple of times.

01:29:14.443 --> 01:29:16.787
I just haven't been able
to get down there.

01:29:16.945 --> 01:29:20.415
It means that Decatur
is my territory again.

01:29:22.951 --> 01:29:25.704
And I want to apologize.

01:29:28.207 --> 01:29:32.552
I'm gonna make sure that
Dean transfers that sale to you.

01:29:32.711 --> 01:29:36.465
Why, Henry?
Business is business.

01:29:38.967 --> 01:29:43.437
No, Dean's done right.
You should be proud of him.

01:29:56.527 --> 01:29:58.119
Jim.

01:29:58.861 --> 01:30:00.909
Isn't there something more?

01:30:04.158 --> 01:30:07.412
I'll see you at the next
Liberty meeting, Henry.

01:31:05.594 --> 01:31:07.392
Henry, did you eat?

01:31:07.554 --> 01:31:10.181
I left your dinner in the fridge.

01:31:13.184 --> 01:31:14.936
Henry?

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:23.736
It's Brad Johnson, isn't it?

01:31:31.202 --> 01:31:33.251
Did Dean do it?

01:31:36.874 --> 01:31:38.467
No.

01:31:42.046 --> 01:31:43.844
It was me.

01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:48.302
It, uh...

01:31:50.554 --> 01:31:53.056
it was an accident.

01:31:57.810 --> 01:32:02.907
I... I didn't know what to do. I...

01:32:06.237 --> 01:32:08.989
I don't know what to do.

01:32:57.703 --> 01:32:59.705
We're a team.

01:33:04.710 --> 01:33:06.633
We're a team.

01:33:10.716 --> 01:33:16.348
And you and I are gonna pick
ourselves up by our bootstraps.

01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:21.105
We're gonna keep
a smile on our face.

01:33:22.936 --> 01:33:26.110
We're gonna work real hard.

01:33:28.275 --> 01:33:32.371
In less than a month,
it's Customer Appreciation Day.

01:33:34.239 --> 01:33:36.958
And after that's the harvest.

01:33:40.203 --> 01:33:42.956
It's gonna be a great harvest.

01:34:59.864 --> 01:35:03.243
Dear Mom and Dad,
I made it to the top.

01:35:03.409 --> 01:35:07.289
The sky is so clear,
I can see all the way to Iowa.

01:35:07.997 --> 01:35:11.216
I wonder if this is how God feels.

01:35:11.375 --> 01:35:14.128
Inside are some earrings
for you, Mom.

01:35:14.294 --> 01:35:17.093
You always looked beautiful
in this color.

01:35:18.883 --> 01:35:21.977
Dad, I hope you'll be proud of me.

01:35:22.428 --> 01:35:23.930
I'll be home soon.

01:35:24.681 --> 01:35:27.809
Love, Grant.

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.829
Thank you, sir.
I think that one's cooked.

01:35:43.991 --> 01:35:45.367
How you doing,
sweetheart?

01:35:45.576 --> 01:35:48.204
Yeah, of course. Thanks
for coming out, guys. Hi.

01:35:49.245 --> 01:35:51.544
Is he still up?

01:35:54.459 --> 01:35:56.461
Oh, that's wonderful.

01:35:58.755 --> 01:36:01.928
You're making your family
very proud, sonny boy.

01:36:02.091 --> 01:36:04.059
What I'm supposed to do.
Damn right.

01:36:04.218 --> 01:36:05.390
All right.

01:36:05.554 --> 01:36:07.727
Keep it up.
Thanks.

01:36:08.306 --> 01:36:10.354
Hello, everybody.
Hello.

01:36:10.517 --> 01:36:15.363
And welcome to Whipple's 12th
Annual Customer Appreciation Day.

01:36:18.274 --> 01:36:21.949
I hope everybody here is enjoying
the Hickory Park barbecue

01:36:22.111 --> 01:36:23.909
and the Picket Fence ice cream.

01:36:24.071 --> 01:36:27.951
Some of us love it a little bit
more than others. Hee-hoo.

01:36:29.952 --> 01:36:32.705
Now, this summer,
we won back Decatur,

01:36:32.872 --> 01:36:36.843
making us number one
in seven counties again.

01:36:40.588 --> 01:36:42.716
But more importantly,

01:36:43.298 --> 01:36:47.600
I got a son to inherit
the family farm.

01:36:49.722 --> 01:36:51.723
It's what I always wanted.

01:36:54.393 --> 01:36:57.896
So am I a happy man?
Yeah.

01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:01.692
Am I a happy man?
Yeah.

01:37:02.401 --> 01:37:04.619
How could I not be?

01:37:07.697 --> 01:37:10.450
But today, I choose to value you.

01:37:10.617 --> 01:37:13.120
Each and every one of you.

01:37:13.703 --> 01:37:15.330
Thank you.

01:37:15.497 --> 01:37:18.090
And happy
Customer Appreciation Day.

01:37:18.250 --> 01:37:19.547
Yeah.

01:37:20.042 --> 01:37:22.512
Now I'd like to get my son up here.

01:37:22.671 --> 01:37:24.923
The future of Whipple & Sons,

01:37:25.089 --> 01:37:28.219
Dean Whipple.
Dean, come on up here.

01:37:31.887 --> 01:37:33.764
Thank you, Dad.

01:37:41.772 --> 01:37:45.868
So we mentioned Decatur
and winning.

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:49.906
In my years as a racer,
before I was injured,

01:37:50.072 --> 01:37:53.622
I won just about every trophy
figure-eight racing had to offer.

01:37:53.784 --> 01:37:57.459
I know what it takes to be number one.
That is the level of success

01:37:57.621 --> 01:38:00.750
that I will bring to each
and every one of your fields.
