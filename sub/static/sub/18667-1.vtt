00:02.378 --> 00:04.337
Hi, everyone. I'm Jeff Dunham.

00:04.338 --> 00:08.173
Greetings, infidels.
I am Achmed, the dead terrorist.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.759
I have a question for you, Achmed.

00:09.760 --> 00:12.470
I am all ears, without actual ears.

00:12.471 --> 00:13.930
All right.

00:13.931 --> 00:16.099
Who's your favorite
cartoon character?

00:16.100 --> 00:20.020
Is this a trick question?
No. Seriously, who is it?

00:20.021 --> 00:24.024
Tigger. As in Winnie the Pooh?

00:24.025 --> 00:27.193
Yes, and Eeyore. He was so sad.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.695
And Piglet?

00:28.696 --> 00:30.280
Don't be an idiot.

00:30.281 --> 00:31.448
Sorry.
Whatever.

00:31.449 --> 00:33.116
What is the point of this?

00:33.117 --> 00:35.368
What if you, Achmed, were animated?

00:35.369 --> 00:36.786
Me? A cartoon?

00:36.787 --> 00:38.747
Right.
Like Tigger?

00:38.748 --> 00:41.082
Sure.
That would be fantastic.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.417
Then wish for it.

00:42.418 --> 00:44.044
What?
Make a wish.

00:44.045 --> 00:46.755
Oh, like, "I wish I were animated"?

00:46.756 --> 00:48.089
Perfect.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.383
Hi, everybody.
Aah!

00:50.384 --> 00:52.552
I am Tinker Bubba.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.596
What the-
Hi, Tinker Bubba.

00:54.597 --> 00:57.557
Howdy. Did I hear
someone make a wish?

00:57.558 --> 00:58.850
Yep. That was Achmed.

00:58.851 --> 01:01.186
A wish? What wish?

01:01.187 --> 01:04.480
You said you wished
to be intoxicated.

01:04.482 --> 01:08.359
No, animated.
Oh, well, I can do that too.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.987
This is ridic-

01:10.988 --> 01:12.405
Ah! Oh!

01:12.406 --> 01:14.407
What happened to me?
Why do I look like this?

01:14.408 --> 01:16.659
Thank you, Tinker Bubba.
You're welcome.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.244
You infidel fairy.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.955
Toot-toot for now. Got to fly.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.766
Whoo-hoo!

01:24.251 --> 01:26.169
You tricked me.
You got your wish.

01:26.170 --> 01:27.837
And why am I like this?

01:27.838 --> 01:29.339
It's for your new animated special,

01:29.340 --> 01:31.049
Achmed Saves America.

01:31.050 --> 01:32.467
Enjoy the show.

01:32.468 --> 01:35.654
Come back, Tinker Bubba!

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.034 --> 01:58.677
I will kill you.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.874
Oh, not a phone call
while I'm riding.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.585
I have coverage all
the way out here

02:07.586 --> 02:10.231
and not a cell tower in sight.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.050
Yes, yes.
What? What?

02:14.051 --> 02:17.137
Achmed. Why are you still alive?

02:17.138 --> 02:18.721
Nice talking to you too.

02:18.722 --> 02:21.599
Wheel of Fortune!

02:21.600 --> 02:24.394
I should have heard
a big boom by now.

02:24.395 --> 02:26.229
You have worked for
us for three years,

02:26.230 --> 02:28.940
and you still haven't
killed infidel one.

02:28.941 --> 02:31.526
I swear, you are the
worst terrorist

02:31.527 --> 02:33.236
in the whole non-Muslim world.

02:33.237 --> 02:34.696
I am not.

02:34.697 --> 02:37.198
As a devout non-Muslim,
I am offended by that.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.534
Are you forgetting you
blew up a training camp?

02:39.535 --> 02:42.412
The only thing left
was the monkey bars.

02:42.413 --> 02:46.875
Oh, please. We are so
much better than them.

02:46.876 --> 02:49.961
Do not worry, Hassan.
I will get it right this time.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.379
Achmed, focus!

02:51.380 --> 02:53.298
You're not losing
your nerve, are you?

02:53.299 --> 02:54.966
No!
Are you kidding?

02:54.967 --> 02:57.594
I'd be crazy not to
want to kill myself.

02:57.595 --> 03:00.013
Then tell me why you
are doing this mission.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.222
Because you told me to.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.599
Wrong answer!
Why?

03:02.600 --> 03:04.184
Because I hate the infidel.

03:04.185 --> 03:06.686
And why do you hate the infidel?

03:06.687 --> 03:08.438
Because you told me to.

03:08.439 --> 03:11.399
Right answer.
So don't screw this up.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.109
Why do you treat me like a fool?

03:13.110 --> 03:15.170
The bomb is ready to go.

03:16.405 --> 03:17.840
Oops.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.413
Huh?

03:25.414 --> 03:26.915
Hey.

03:26.916 --> 03:29.375
I'm alive.
I failed!

03:29.376 --> 03:31.127
Son of a female dog.

03:31.128 --> 03:35.173
Well, it obviously can't
get any worse than this.

03:35.174 --> 03:36.799
Huh!

03:36.800 --> 03:39.594
What the Hezbollah?
Let me go, you flying jackal.

03:39.595 --> 03:42.931
Release me at once.

03:42.932 --> 03:44.933
Clutch me again! I was kidding!

03:44.934 --> 03:46.827
I was kidding!

03:50.356 --> 03:53.233
Well, that used to hurt.

03:53.234 --> 03:56.712
Wait. Where is this
aluminum devil taking me?

03:58.530 --> 03:59.030
No!

04:40.572 --> 04:42.549
Mmm.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.008
Hmm. Hey.

05:00.009 --> 05:02.319
Death to America... ville.

05:08.142 --> 05:12.895
Terrorist log, hate date 7/3/13.

05:12.896 --> 05:16.316
I have arrived in the
land of the infidels.

05:16.317 --> 05:19.652
It will only be a matter
of time until-Aah!

05:19.653 --> 05:21.863
Oh, boy.

05:21.864 --> 05:25.074
I don't know what that was,
but it made a doozy of a noise.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.909
I hope we hit something cool.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.870
Then this day wouldn't
be a total loss.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.246
Whatever.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.081
Everyone's at the mall except me.

05:32.082 --> 05:35.001
And now my life is over.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.753
Well, I know we hit something,

05:36.754 --> 05:38.838
but darn if I know what it was.

05:38.839 --> 05:43.509
Turn around, asshat.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.969
Is that what we hit?

05:44.970 --> 05:46.346
Whoa! Is he dead?

05:46.347 --> 05:48.431
Can't we go now?

05:48.432 --> 05:50.641
No, honey. We have to help him.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.060
Here you go, buddy. You're fine.

05:52.061 --> 05:53.269
You're gonna be fine.
Wait. stop.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.771
Let me give you a hand with that.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.105
What are you doing?
Oh, that is a hand.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.440
Get your hands off of me.

05:57.441 --> 05:58.691
And the diaper goes on top, right?

05:58.692 --> 06:00.068
Wait a minute.
That's a knee.

06:00.069 --> 06:01.486
I don't even touch myself there.

06:01.487 --> 06:02.779
That's a...
What are you doing?

06:02.780 --> 06:07.158
...third knee.
Stop touching me!

06:07.159 --> 06:09.702
You put my ass in front!

06:09.703 --> 06:11.329
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.456
Oh, that makes me
feel so much better.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.416
I guess we should exchange
insurance information-

06:15.417 --> 06:18.127
Ooh.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.921
Oh, that looks like ours.

06:19.922 --> 06:21.589
Ew!
Oh,

06:21.590 --> 06:23.800
Can we get you to a
doctor or something?

06:23.801 --> 06:25.861
I want nothing to do with you.

06:29.348 --> 06:32.558
How I wish that evil airplane
had never carried me

06:32.559 --> 06:35.728
from my homeland to this
wretched America of yours.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.731
Mom, did you hear that?
He said he just flew here.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.233
Maybe he's our exchange student.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.818
Yeah.

06:41.819 --> 06:45.154
Claude, the French kid we
missed at the airport?

06:45.155 --> 06:47.448
I hate you, and I
hate this country.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.909
Oh, yeah, he's French.
We better stop him.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.869
Excuse me. Sorry to bother you.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.805
What? What? What?

06:55.499 --> 06:57.667
Ah! What devil is this?

06:57.668 --> 06:59.877
Bill, no.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.838
Bill? Seriously?

07:01.839 --> 07:03.714
You give your dogs people names?

07:03.715 --> 07:06.717
What did you name your kids,
Bubbles and Cujo?

07:06.718 --> 07:08.094
Billy, off!

07:08.095 --> 07:10.179
I'm sorry. He just likes you.

07:10.180 --> 07:13.099
Oh, great.
When does the humping start?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.601
By any chance, are you Claude?

07:15.602 --> 07:17.311
Of course I am Claude.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.105
I'm clawed, scratched, bitten,
licked, and humped,

07:19.106 --> 07:20.565
but mostly I am clawed.

07:20.566 --> 07:22.900
So you're saying you're Claude?

07:22.901 --> 07:25.486
Yes, you stupid American infidel.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.780
That's wonderful.
What?

07:27.781 --> 07:31.200
Claude, we are your
host family, the Wilsons,

07:31.201 --> 07:33.286
and we're so happy you're here.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.955
Are you infidels friendly or idiots

07:35.956 --> 07:37.874
or just friendly idiots?

07:37.875 --> 07:39.876
Sorry about the
mix-up at the airport,

07:39.877 --> 07:41.502
but that is all over now.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.171
Let's get you to your new home.

07:43.172 --> 07:45.173
You're taking me to your cave?

07:45.174 --> 07:48.301
Well, I do have a man cave.
It's the garage.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.219
Is he naked?

07:50.220 --> 07:52.472
Try not to make him
feel bad, okay, honey?

07:52.473 --> 07:54.015
He's probably poor.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.142
Let's get you a hot meal first.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.121
We have the foreigner.
Can we please go to the mall?

08:07.696 --> 08:09.197
I have moled myself,

08:09.198 --> 08:11.199
"first season of Homeland" style,

08:11.200 --> 08:13.576
among the enemy, the hated ones.

08:13.577 --> 08:18.181
These people who call themselves
Wilson are cunning, though.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.252
They insist on treating
me with respect

08:23.253 --> 08:26.464
and feeding me an
obscene amount of food

08:26.465 --> 08:28.275
that I can barely keep down.

08:34.640 --> 08:38.619
I have the same problem.

08:46.652 --> 08:49.153
Their town is in terrible shape,

08:49.154 --> 08:52.323
and their lives are filled
with emptiness and failure,

08:52.324 --> 08:54.033
yet they don't take
the obvious route

08:54.034 --> 08:56.744
of blowing themselves and
everyone around them up.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.204
What's up with that?

08:58.205 --> 09:00.081
I just work on the
assembly line now,

09:00.082 --> 09:04.168
but my dream is to design
the cars, like this.

09:04.169 --> 09:07.171
This is a gas-guzzling,
obnoxious testament

09:07.172 --> 09:10.508
to everything the rest of
the world hates about America.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.134
Exactly.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.345
It'll be a huge seller
and save the company.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.806
If only my boss would look at it.

09:16.807 --> 09:22.228
He will, because it's perfect,
honey, just like you.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.355
These are nothing
like the Americans

09:24.356 --> 09:28.568
I was taught to hate,
which makes me hate them more.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.571
Plus, I had no idea
women could drive.

09:31.572 --> 09:34.198
Well, this is your home
for the summer, Claude.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.409
It's cozy, but we love it.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.537
I am nauseated by the
evil stench of decadence.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.747
He did it.
Now, Kevin.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.457
Don't pick on our guest.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.834
He's had a long day.

09:44.835 --> 09:46.544
You know he was hit by a minivan.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.170
Why don't you and your
sister go toss the football

09:48.171 --> 09:50.256
or something?
Fine.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.882
I'm going to Angie's.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.718
Don't ignore your phone.

09:53.719 --> 09:56.137
It's not the phone I ignore.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.763
Kids today.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.266
In my land, they would have
both been stoned by now.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.934
That's right.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.270
You French kids start
drinking early, don't you?

10:04.271 --> 10:06.981
Wayne, remember our surprise.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.399
Oh, sure.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.835
Be right back.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.364
So now that I am deep in
the bowels of the enemy,

10:15.365 --> 10:18.534
I will make it my mission
to explode out a reeky,

10:18.535 --> 10:21.203
steaming vengeance,
but how and when?

10:21.204 --> 10:23.372
Ta-da!

10:23.373 --> 10:25.249
Are you Catholic?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.001
No, we're American.

10:27.002 --> 10:30.338
Claude, you got here just
in time for our town's

10:30.339 --> 10:33.633
100th birthday celebration,
and it's tomorrow!

10:33.634 --> 10:36.344
Ginny's in charge of the
parade and the fireworks.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.346
It's going to be some show.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.640
Fireworks? Explosions?

10:40.641 --> 10:43.726
Large crowds?

10:43.727 --> 10:45.269
We'll fix your room up, Claude.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.979
You go ahead.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.440
I'll just be here innocently
plotting and scheming.

10:49.441 --> 10:52.818
This is going to be
easier than I thought.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.196
Stupid Americans.

10:55.197 --> 10:58.091
They always leave their
dynamite just lying around.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.913
Let me go! I kill you!

11:03.914 --> 11:05.581
Oh, stop. Stop that.

11:05.582 --> 11:08.059
I cannot be murderous
when I am being tickled.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.544
I kill you!

11:10.545 --> 11:13.231
Stop it!

11:14.091 --> 11:16.801
♪ I've been working
on my big bomb ♪

11:16.802 --> 11:21.013
♪ All the dead long night ♪

11:21.014 --> 11:24.767
Dear diary, my bomb is complete.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.561
Tomorrow I will get my
revenge on these people

11:27.562 --> 11:29.313
who have been so nice to me.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.440
Here's a soft pillow.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.109
How I hate them.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.860
Is it hypoallergenic?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.696
Just like you asked.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.865
Yes, thank you, evil,
American, monster she-woman.

11:39.866 --> 11:43.494
You French have such
colorful words for everything.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.454
Oh, are you writing a book?

11:45.455 --> 11:48.791
Yes, it is a book of
humorous observations

11:48.792 --> 11:50.418
about small-town life,

11:50.419 --> 11:53.504
like the kind by your famous
instigator of suicide,

11:53.505 --> 11:55.005
Garrison Keillor.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.924
That's nice. Nighty-night now.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.218
Nighty-night.
Nighty-night.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.346
Hello, gorgeous.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.806
Hey! I want to talk to you.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.599
I don't have a bomb.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.601
You're not fooling me, kid.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.437
I know why you're here.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.605
Is that so?

12:11.606 --> 12:12.833
Well...

12:14.484 --> 12:17.236
My parents brought you here
just to make me look bad.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.321
La la la la.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.031
I can't compare to
how cool you are.

12:21.032 --> 12:23.367
You're from France and all.
I hate you.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.161
Aw, really?

12:25.162 --> 12:26.829
I hate you too.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.039
My dad thinks I should
be playing football,

12:29.040 --> 12:30.750
but I don't want to do that.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.460
I'm good at other stuff-

12:32.461 --> 12:35.463
secret stuff I've never
even told my parents about.

12:35.464 --> 12:38.048
You wish to lie with
another boy of your gender?

12:38.049 --> 12:41.886
No! I want to be a ventriloquist.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.429
A what?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.055
You know, a ventriloquist.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.099
I have a dummy. I make it talk.

12:47.100 --> 12:51.020
We tell jokes in front of big
audiences and get big laughs.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.105
That is a job?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.875
Yes!

12:56.526 --> 12:59.278
That is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

12:59.279 --> 13:03.199
Seriously, who is going to pay
to see anyone do that crap?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.950
But I'm good at it.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.203
I've been practicing
with my new dummy.

13:07.204 --> 13:08.496
Da-d a-d a-d a!

13:08.497 --> 13:09.789
Little Jeff.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.332
Hiya, Claude.

13:11.333 --> 13:14.919
That toy is possessed
with a human spirit!

13:14.920 --> 13:16.587
I pound your face with a shoe,

13:16.588 --> 13:18.088
which is the worst thing you can do

13:18.089 --> 13:20.007
to someone in my country
for some reason

13:20.008 --> 13:22.134
that no one has ever
explained to anyone.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.094
Hey, what's wrong with you?

13:24.095 --> 13:26.263
I'm sorry I said anything to you.

13:26.264 --> 13:29.141
This is gonna be a long summer.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.935
Or a short one.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.728
Aah!

13:32.729 --> 13:34.730
Whew.
It's only you.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.816
I thought you were
Jessica Chastain.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.317
Who's that?

13:38.318 --> 13:39.610
She was the crazy
bitch in The Help.

13:39.611 --> 13:40.945
What are you doing here?

13:40.946 --> 13:42.780
I was, like, out with my boyfriend,

13:42.781 --> 13:44.156
now my ex-boyfriend.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.784
Ugh. I hate him.
I wish he was dead.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.035
Hmm.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.454
Does he live within
a 20-mile radius

13:50.455 --> 13:52.164
of tomorrow's parade?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.916
Please don't tell Mom and Dad.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.877
The place where my lips
once were is sealed.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.671
They never liked him anyway.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.590
They think I have, like,
bad taste in guys?

14:01.591 --> 14:05.261
You? No.
Don't be so hard on your-

14:05.262 --> 14:08.389
Mwah.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.140
Wow.

14:10.141 --> 14:13.269
I felt something just now.

14:13.270 --> 14:16.564
Well, that was my detonator-
bomb, penis, nothing!

14:16.565 --> 14:18.774
You're so funny.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.067
Gracias?

14:20.068 --> 14:22.403
And I love your French accent.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.196
Cassidy, are you home?

14:24.197 --> 14:27.074
Got to go.
I'll love you till I die.

14:27.075 --> 14:31.262
Stay within the 20-mile radius.

14:32.664 --> 14:35.416
Good night, Cassidy.
Good night, Mom.

14:35.417 --> 14:38.002
Good night, Kevin.
Good night, Dad!

14:38.003 --> 14:39.587
Good night, Ginny!

14:39.588 --> 14:41.005
Why are you screaming at me

14:41.006 --> 14:42.590
when I'm lying right next to you?

14:42.591 --> 14:43.716
Sorry, honey!

14:43.717 --> 14:44.842
Good night, little Jeff!

14:44.843 --> 14:45.968
Good night, "ethery-diddy"!

14:45.969 --> 14:47.177
Silence!

14:47.178 --> 14:50.824
Good night, bomb.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.152
Great job, Mom.

15:03.153 --> 15:05.571
Thanks.
And don't you two look nice.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.281
Yeah, I got this shirt at the-

15:07.282 --> 15:08.908
Ah! It's almost time
for the show to start.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.534
Kevin, do you know where Claude is?

15:10.535 --> 15:12.536
No, Mom, I don't.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.205
"Claude. Claude. Where's Claude?"

15:15.206 --> 15:17.041
Everybody loves the French guy.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.500
He was in the car with us.

15:18.501 --> 15:21.337
He had on this great
French cologne.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.589
It smelled like sawdust
and fertilizer.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.675
Here we are! Almost there.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.762
Nobody help or touch me, please.

15:29.763 --> 15:32.598
Also, please turn off
all cell phones.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.808
Claude, you look so patriotic.

15:34.809 --> 15:37.853
Yes, it is patriotism is
given me a glow in my heart

15:37.854 --> 15:39.355
and a pain in my neck.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.106
Ow!

15:41.107 --> 15:43.817
Ginny, the town square looks great.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.570
This event will be just
the thing to turn around

15:46.571 --> 15:48.948
our town spirit and
get me reelected,

15:48.949 --> 15:51.325
or you're fired.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.786
Just kidding. Not really.

15:53.787 --> 15:58.415
Mayor McEwen, this is Claude,
our French exchange student.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.269
Bonjour, Claude.
Comment allez-vous?

16:09.344 --> 16:13.514
Uh, ou est la toilette fromage?

16:13.515 --> 16:16.892
Oh, that's cute.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.978
Whoa! What the hell?

16:18.979 --> 16:21.021
Holy crap!

16:21.022 --> 16:22.189
Pardon my French.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.358
Hey, Ginny, nice shindig.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.276
A little low-key if you ask me.

16:26.277 --> 16:27.945
I mean, where's the eagle?

16:27.946 --> 16:29.905
Nothing says kick-ass like a flag

16:29.906 --> 16:31.824
with wings that go Americaw!

16:31.825 --> 16:33.117
Americaw!

16:33.118 --> 16:34.743
Americaw!
Americaw!

16:34.744 --> 16:35.869
Americaw!

16:35.870 --> 16:38.473
Americaw!
Ah!

16:46.131 --> 16:49.049
Claude, these are
our neighbors, the Andersons.

16:49.050 --> 16:51.176
Chet and Ev, this is Claude.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.886
Nice to meet you, Claude.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.930
You know, I usually
don't like you Frenchies,

16:54.931 --> 16:57.641
but in your case,
I'll make an exception.

16:57.642 --> 17:00.019
Don't be an idiot.
I hate the French.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.022
Well, then we are gonna
be simpatico.

17:03.023 --> 17:06.733
Ha. That's Mexican for
"I wet your back, you wet mine."

17:06.734 --> 17:09.737
Such a delightful racist.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.756
I like you.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.747
Way to set an example, Chet.
Carl Zimmer.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.915
We're not all tea-bagging
wing nuts like him, Claude.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.292
Yeah? And we're not all
freedom-hating, Al-kissing,

17:24.294 --> 17:26.545
gunless lesbians like this guy.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.963
Americaw!

17:27.964 --> 17:30.466
Please, can't you two get along?

17:30.467 --> 17:33.052
Very soon none of this will matter.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.636
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:34.637 --> 17:37.347
I have to go
to the little French boys' room.

17:37.348 --> 17:40.017
Hurry back.
You don't want to miss the show.

17:40.018 --> 17:43.037
My show will leave
a bigger impression.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.198
Five minutes to blow time.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.991
I should totally tweet that.

17:55.992 --> 17:59.411
Justin Bieber is going
to be in Portland!

17:59.412 --> 18:02.039
And in the centennial spirit,

18:02.040 --> 18:04.166
suits at Stan McEwen's
Wide and Tall

18:04.167 --> 18:06.335
are on sale for $100.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.879
Supply is limited.
Suits may have been pre-worn.

18:08.880 --> 18:12.925
Now, we have a very special
guest here today, uh, somewhere.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.551
Right?

18:14.552 --> 18:17.679
I don't know where he-
There he is.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.306
Claude, up here.

18:19.307 --> 18:22.827
A big hand for our new
friend from France, everyone.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.399
Hello.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.568
You don't know me
from a hole in the ground,

18:31.569 --> 18:32.861
but get ready!

18:32.862 --> 18:34.696
Bye, now.
T-T-F-U.

18:34.697 --> 18:38.033
Oh, no, you're not going
anywhere, our new friend.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.202
Help! I'm being illegally detained

18:40.203 --> 18:42.996
by a large black man
who is dressed very nicely.

18:42.997 --> 18:46.416
You big silly.
We have something for you.

18:46.417 --> 18:49.128
Oh, good.
I have something for you too.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.922
You first.

18:51.923 --> 18:54.591
America is a nation of foreigners,

18:54.592 --> 18:56.510
and you're our first legal one.

18:56.511 --> 18:59.388
And now Raul's Gardening Service

18:59.389 --> 19:03.368
would like to give you
a 21-leaf-blower salute.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.354
That's why we're all here-

19:07.355 --> 19:10.041
to thank you and welcome you!

19:12.026 --> 19:14.128
Hooray!

19:19.784 --> 19:23.388
You people are all
so moronically cheerful.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.915
Now, to help celebrate
Claude's arrival,

19:26.916 --> 19:30.878
put your hands together
for American Idol season nine

19:30.879 --> 19:33.422

20:48.164 --> 20:51.208
They stay in their caves,
knee-deep in camel poop,

20:51.209 --> 20:54.586
covering their wives so they
look like Pac-Man ghosts.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.004
That's French for you.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.673
I love this country.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.609
Life to America!

Where is that bomb?

21:15.024 --> 21:17.317
It's always in the
last place you look.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.403
Ow!

21:19.404 --> 21:20.570
There you are.

21:20.571 --> 21:23.824
Huh?

21:23.825 --> 21:27.869
You actual, literal son of a bitch.

21:27.870 --> 21:30.205
No, no, no, no,
that is not a squeaky bomb.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.040
Give me that bomb.

21:32.041 --> 21:35.186
I have to save the people
I wanted to kill a minute ago.

21:38.047 --> 21:41.133
The things I have to do.

21:41.134 --> 21:44.219
Billy, look what I have for you.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.971
It's your favorite...

21:45.972 --> 21:47.556
femur.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.325
Go get it, Bill!

21:53.229 --> 21:57.733
Oh...

21:57.734 --> 22:00.795
No!

22:03.531 --> 22:07.510
Fuuuuuu-

22:14.334 --> 22:16.060
Whew! That was close.

22:17.628 --> 22:19.730
That's a pretty big button.

22:24.594 --> 22:26.178
Ooh!

22:26.179 --> 22:31.451
I bet this looks awesome
from down there!

22:32.602 --> 22:35.145
He really loves America.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.956
I sure hope so.

22:39.609 --> 22:43.463
America, I love you!

22:44.989 --> 22:47.908
Still love it.

22:47.909 --> 22:50.178
Loving it a little less.

22:58.169 --> 23:00.504
I'm at Americaville General Hospital

23:00.505 --> 23:02.798
where an entire town
is holding a vigil

23:02.799 --> 23:05.300
for someone they just met
this morning...

23:05.301 --> 23:08.404
a brave little boy
from France named Claude.

23:09.722 --> 23:10.847
Ah!

23:10.848 --> 23:12.391
La la la la!

23:12.392 --> 23:14.494
It's burning.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.565
Doctor, is he gonna be okay?

23:20.566 --> 23:23.693
Well, he displays
no vital signs whatsoever.

23:23.694 --> 23:26.255
The technical term
for that is "dead."

23:27.949 --> 23:30.885
Golly, that sounds serious.
Huh?

23:32.412 --> 23:33.620
He's waking up.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.205
My boyfriend's waking up.

23:35.206 --> 23:38.834
The wire that's blue
will not hurt you.

23:38.835 --> 23:42.087
The wire that's red
will make us dead.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.840
Shh. I think he's trying
to tell us something.

23:44.841 --> 23:48.927

23:50.972 --> 23:53.557

23:55.351 --> 23:56.560
Hey, everybody!

23:56.561 --> 23:58.395
Oh, the pain!

23:58.396 --> 24:03.358
It's making me say things
only sung at terrorist camp.

24:03.359 --> 24:04.901
Well, that's the most

24:04.902 --> 24:07.654
we can expect
from him right now, I'm afraid.

24:07.655 --> 24:10.490
We should leave him now.
He needs his rest.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.242
Mom, I guess you'll need
someone to take

24:12.243 --> 24:13.743
Claude's spot in the parade.

24:13.744 --> 24:15.412
I've been working on something.

24:15.413 --> 24:16.663
Parade?

24:16.664 --> 24:18.623
I can be in a real American parade

24:18.624 --> 24:21.042
where people wait all night
to get great seats

24:21.043 --> 24:22.502
to watch other people walk?

24:22.503 --> 24:24.963
Count me in!

24:24.964 --> 24:26.423
Sorry.

24:26.424 --> 24:29.050
Hmm.
I thought you were dead.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.469
It's a miracle.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.179
Aah!

24:32.180 --> 24:36.867
I declare
this centennial parade started!

24:44.484 --> 24:46.693
Look what you did, Claude.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.778
You've inspired the entire town.

24:48.779 --> 24:50.197
Thank you.

24:50.198 --> 24:52.449
I don't have
to blow up again, do I?

24:52.450 --> 24:54.201
Congratulations, Claude.

24:54.202 --> 24:55.827
In the words of Michelle Obama,

24:55.828 --> 24:57.871
"For the first time
in my adult lifetime,

24:57.872 --> 25:00.165
I'm really proud of my country."

25:00.166 --> 25:02.083
Yes, we heard her say that.

25:02.084 --> 25:03.960
That is when we recruited her.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.087
She is a true American.

25:06.088 --> 25:08.715
Yes, and her hair
is actually straight.

25:08.716 --> 25:13.553
Son, you're the real hero,
210% American.

25:13.554 --> 25:15.430
You people suck at mathematics.

25:15.431 --> 25:16.723
I love it.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.850
Claude, Dave Chester, CNN.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.144
CNN? I love you guys.

25:21.145 --> 25:23.647
You're the Borders Books
of cable networks.

25:23.648 --> 25:25.607
Claude, you've only
been here two days,

25:25.608 --> 25:28.568
and you've already been hit
by a truck, gotten blown up,

25:28.569 --> 25:30.946
rolled down a hill in
a fiery Dumpster...

25:30.947 --> 25:32.572
And I've tried curly fries.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.574
So how do you like our country?

25:34.575 --> 25:37.953
Well, I'm in America,
so I won't tell you how I feel.

25:37.954 --> 25:41.540
I will sing, just like those
30-year-old teenagers

25:41.541 --> 25:44.668
on that bafflingly
beloved TV show Glee.

27:57.134 --> 27:59.552
Good night, Ginny.
Good night, Claude.

27:59.553 --> 28:02.055
Good night, Wayne.
Good night, Claude.

28:02.056 --> 28:04.724
Good night, Cassidy.
Good night, Claude.

28:04.725 --> 28:07.477
Good night, Kevin.
Good night, Claude.

Good night, Kevin's creepy,
dead-eyed boy doll.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.648
Shut "ut"!

28:11.649 --> 28:15.628
Okay. Good night, America.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.160
Chet, you're gonna
crash this thing!

28:24.161 --> 28:27.139
We're already late, thanks to you.

28:33.003 --> 28:34.713
Will you hurry up?

28:34.714 --> 28:37.298
Well, I'm sorry.
My flip-flop blew out.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.092
Well, then you're
gonna be left behind.

28:39.093 --> 28:42.887
I want to make sure Claude
sees me cheering him on.

28:42.888 --> 28:45.014
Hey, there, Carl. Nice view, huh?

28:45.015 --> 28:46.349
It's all right.

28:46.350 --> 28:47.559
So, uh...

28:47.560 --> 28:48.893
Any room up there for-

28:48.894 --> 28:50.353
No. No, Chet, not really.

28:50.354 --> 28:51.896
I've been waiting here all morning.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.648
Look, can you help a friend out?

28:53.649 --> 28:55.942
I could help you, but
then you'd come to depend

28:55.943 --> 28:58.611
on that help, like a welfare queen.

28:58.612 --> 29:01.489
God dang it.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.116
Hey, uh, boss, check it out.

29:03.117 --> 29:06.578
It has dual quad carbs like
an original muscle car,

29:06.579 --> 29:08.455
but I designed it
to sit on a chassis

29:08.456 --> 29:09.998
of our existing midsize,

29:09.999 --> 29:11.666
so you'd only have
to make a few tweaks

29:11.667 --> 29:13.835
on the assembly line to-
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

29:13.836 --> 29:15.920
You think maybe later
I could have my picture taken

29:15.921 --> 29:17.422
with the French kid?

29:17.423 --> 29:18.923
Sure, but maybe then
can you look at the-

29:18.924 --> 29:20.550
I'll definitely think
about it, Wayne.

29:20.551 --> 29:23.219
Can we Photoshop Claude in
with the CEO, do you think?

29:23.220 --> 29:24.804
I guess Yeah, great, great.

29:24.805 --> 29:27.182
I got to pee.

29:27.183 --> 29:30.477
Good afternoon, everyone.
I'm Mayor Stan McEwen.

29:30.478 --> 29:32.353
I'm not sure what we're
in store for today,

29:32.354 --> 29:34.522
but I know it will be special.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.191
It is my honor

29:36.192 --> 29:38.777
to present the chairwoman
of my reelection campaign,

29:38.778 --> 29:40.570
Mrs. Ginny Wilson.

29:40.571 --> 29:42.739
Hello, everyone.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.616
I know you're waiting
for the main event,

29:44.617 --> 29:46.951
so I'll just read from
these prepared remarks

29:46.952 --> 29:49.037
written by our special guest.

29:49.038 --> 29:52.707
"Good afternoon, my cherished
new American fiends."

29:52.708 --> 29:54.459
Friends! Friends!

29:54.460 --> 29:57.879
Sorry. Wha-it-it
says "fiends" here.

29:57.880 --> 30:01.508
That is a typo and
not a Freudian slip

30:01.509 --> 30:03.551
reflecting something
I used to believe

30:03.552 --> 30:05.637
with every fiber of my being.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.430
"I hope you will appreciate

30:07.431 --> 30:09.307
the wonderful surprise
I hate for you."

30:09.308 --> 30:10.642
Have.

30:10.643 --> 30:12.185
"And I hope it will kill you."

30:12.186 --> 30:13.978
Thrill. More typos.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.855
Stupid AutoCorrect.

30:15.856 --> 30:18.441
Am I right?

30:18.442 --> 30:19.859
Maybe we should skip.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.361
Right, right.

30:21.362 --> 30:23.571
Well, clearly I'm not
very good at this,

30:23.572 --> 30:25.490
so let me hand over the program

30:25.491 --> 30:27.575
to the reason we're all here today,

30:27.576 --> 30:30.078
Americaville's new favorite son,

30:30.079 --> 30:34.099
your friend and mine, Claude!

31:01.360 --> 31:04.612
Thank you! You are too kind.

31:04.613 --> 31:05.822
Okay.

31:05.823 --> 31:07.240
If I could have-

31:07.241 --> 31:10.201
Thank you.
Really, this is too much.

31:10.202 --> 31:13.973
Thank you. If-Silence!

31:15.958 --> 31:17.876
I've had some time to reflect

31:17.877 --> 31:20.879
on what you wonderful people
in this wonderful town

31:20.880 --> 31:23.506
in this wonderful
country mean to me.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.050
And today I, Claude, from France,

31:26.051 --> 31:28.303
want to pay you back
for the hospitality

31:28.304 --> 31:29.637
you have shown me,

31:29.638 --> 31:31.764
to thank not just
the Wilson family.

31:31.765 --> 31:33.766
Give them a hand.

31:33.767 --> 31:35.727
There they are.

31:35.728 --> 31:38.646
Very nice.

31:38.647 --> 31:41.816
Cassidy, please,
don't get hooked on me.

31:41.817 --> 31:44.819
Choose one of the many
idiot boys in this town.

31:44.820 --> 31:47.071
And, Kevin, I like you.
I really do.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.990
Put down that stupid dummy.

31:48.991 --> 31:52.761
You will never get girls as
long as you have that thing.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.581
Anyway, I am so
grateful to all of you

31:56.582 --> 31:59.417
that I have decided to
present you with a gift,

31:59.418 --> 32:02.712
much as you Americans were
given the Statue of Liberty

32:02.713 --> 32:04.631
by my country of France-

32:04.632 --> 32:06.883
France being the place
I am from and no place else.

32:06.884 --> 32:10.094
Here it is!

32:10.095 --> 32:12.847
Hey, that's just Big Rock Rock.

32:12.848 --> 32:14.682
Hmm.
Yes...

32:14.683 --> 32:17.560
But thanks to my
talents in explosives,

32:17.561 --> 32:20.229
talents which I learned
along with every other

32:20.230 --> 32:23.399
French school boy in France,
the land of my birth,

32:23.400 --> 32:25.401
I present to you...

32:25.402 --> 32:29.339
Mount America Foreverberg!

32:32.534 --> 32:36.287
These are your four
greatest American icons-

32:36.288 --> 32:39.207
billionaire wig model
Donald Trump...

32:39.208 --> 32:42.126
professional man-hater
Taylor Swift...

32:42.127 --> 32:45.588
tiny ageless weirdo Tom Cruise...

32:45.589 --> 32:50.093
and famed drug lord
Lance Armstrong!

32:50.094 --> 32:52.762
I'm getting a hankering
for the full-on salute.

32:52.763 --> 32:55.723
So you still do get those?

32:55.724 --> 32:58.226
Tom Cruise starred in
one of my favorite films,

32:58.227 --> 32:59.686
Jerry Maguire.

32:59.687 --> 33:01.896
I got misty when Renee
Zellweger dumped him.

33:01.897 --> 33:05.817
Thanks for the spoiler, jerk.
I haven't watched it yet.

33:05.818 --> 33:08.736
We love you!

33:08.737 --> 33:10.547
Way to go.
You're the best, Achmed.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.492
My American dream has come true.

33:14.493 --> 33:17.996
I believe I can safely say,
with no fear of being

33:17.997 --> 33:20.415
ironically contradicted,
that nothing,

33:20.416 --> 33:23.543
I mean nothing, can ruin
this golden moment.

33:23.544 --> 33:26.754
Hello, Achmed.

33:26.755 --> 33:29.007
Holy crap.

33:29.008 --> 33:34.053
United States Americans,
my name is Hassan al-Hassan.

33:34.054 --> 33:35.888
Hey, that there's a terrorist.

33:35.889 --> 33:37.181
Nice going, Chet.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.933
Just because he has an Arabic name,

33:38.934 --> 33:41.019
he's automatically a terrorist.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.645
I am a terrorist.

33:42.646 --> 33:46.024
Welcome to America.

33:46.025 --> 33:48.484
This person is a traitor!

33:48.485 --> 33:52.947
Achmed's name isn't Claude.
Achmed's name is Achmed.

33:52.948 --> 33:54.073
It is?

33:54.074 --> 33:57.201
And he is a terrorist.
He is?

33:57.202 --> 33:59.203
And he is a skeleton.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.580
He is?

34:00.581 --> 34:02.665
A re r-re re-to n?
I am?

34:02.666 --> 34:06.478
Yeah, but if his name is
Achmed, then where's Claude?

34:14.469 --> 34:16.637
Is what he said true?

34:16.638 --> 34:18.473
No!
Well...

34:18.474 --> 34:22.018
No, no, no, I'm no terrorist.
I'm a nice guy.

34:22.018 --> 34:25.146
You know, the real me,
production-number me.

34:25.147 --> 34:26.438
Remember my song?

34:26.440 --> 34:28.065
Everything you know about me

34:28.067 --> 34:30.693
says I'm a great guy
and a true American.

34:30.694 --> 34:34.781
Everything except this!

34:34.782 --> 34:37.283
I found this in his room.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.284
All his plans to blow
us up are in here...

34:39.286 --> 34:43.039
and some weird drawings of
him riding a flying horse?

34:43.040 --> 34:46.083
It was a superhero character
I was working on-

34:46.085 --> 34:47.918
Turban Cowboy.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.629
It's turban time.

34:49.630 --> 34:52.983
Well, now that I
hear it out loud...

34:55.594 --> 34:57.053
Come on, guys.

34:57.054 --> 34:58.763
This is America,
where if you're white,

34:58.764 --> 35:00.598
you can get away with anything.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.493
And there's nobody whiter than me.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.604
I know him.
In my heart, it's not true.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.565
Crazy.
What about my reelection?

35:09.566 --> 35:11.734
I think he might be a terrorist.

35:11.735 --> 35:14.529
Please, I beg you. Listen to me.

35:14.530 --> 35:16.948
Are any of us what we
really appear to be?

35:16.949 --> 35:18.616
Daddy, maybe he is a terrorist.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.719
If you would only listen.

35:22.538 --> 35:24.306
Silence!
I kill you!

35:28.001 --> 35:32.463
Is what a real terrorist might say.

35:32.464 --> 35:35.842
I guess we should call the police.

35:35.843 --> 35:38.803
Not necessary. I'm a deputy.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.138
You bought that at a toy store.

35:40.139 --> 35:41.949
I didn't buy this at no toy store.

35:43.142 --> 35:44.851
I won it at a church raffle.

35:44.852 --> 35:47.913
Say your prayers, bonehead.

35:53.318 --> 35:56.529
This is FBI agent Jack Bauer.

35:56.530 --> 35:57.822
Ooh!

35:57.823 --> 35:59.574
Not the one from TV.

35:59.575 --> 36:01.784
Aw!

36:01.785 --> 36:04.245
It's my real name.
It's fairly common.

36:04.246 --> 36:07.165
I get this all the time. Calm down.

36:07.166 --> 36:11.895
You have 24 seconds to
surrender, starting now.

36:13.922 --> 36:16.841
Oh, no, I'm too pretty for prison.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.551
Yes, you are.

36:18.552 --> 36:20.178
Achmed, before you go,

36:20.179 --> 36:22.180
there's someone who
wants to say something.

36:22.181 --> 36:25.600
You're a "dad" man!
You should "de" ashamed.

36:25.601 --> 36:27.995
That toy is possessed
with a human spirit!

36:30.522 --> 36:34.275
Foot bones, don't fail me now!

36:34.276 --> 36:37.153
Stop it, Chet.
You're gonna hurt somebody.

36:37.154 --> 36:41.115
Freedom ain't free, Ev.

36:41.116 --> 36:42.909
Not so fast!

36:42.910 --> 36:45.953
I've got a Mexican,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

36:45.954 --> 36:47.914
I am not an "it."
My name is Carlos.

36:47.915 --> 36:49.540
This is not about you.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.477
Anybody makes a move,
and I blow him.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.218
With the leaf blower.

37:00.219 --> 37:02.386
I can't believe you all went there.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.055
I am so disappointed.

37:04.056 --> 37:06.992
Ah, screw it.

37:12.481 --> 37:16.400
Good-bye, Americaville.

37:16.401 --> 37:17.944
Hello, traitor.

37:17.945 --> 37:19.504
Hassan!

37:24.785 --> 37:28.913
It's day five of
"America Made to Look Stupid."

37:28.914 --> 37:32.041
The little town of Americaville
deals with the revelation

37:32.042 --> 37:35.461
that they've been harboring
the known terrorist Achmed

37:35.462 --> 37:37.755
who lived among them in disguise.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.507
Reaction to this story has come

37:39.508 --> 37:41.509
from across the political spectrum,

37:41.510 --> 37:43.386
with Democrats and Republicans

37:43.387 --> 37:45.930
finally finding common
ground on something.

37:45.931 --> 37:49.642
Americaville, now known
as Terrorist Town, USA,

37:49.643 --> 37:53.396
is the worst city in the
entire United States.

37:53.397 --> 37:54.897
It's a town of pinheads,

37:54.898 --> 37:56.357
and the biggest pinheads of all

37:56.358 --> 37:58.276
are the family that
harbored the terrorist.

37:58.277 --> 37:59.944
And they're the subject
of my new book,

37:59.945 --> 38:01.445
Killing the Wilsons.

38:01.446 --> 38:04.407
America is a country
of laws and due process,

38:04.408 --> 38:05.741
but in the Wilsons' case,

38:05.742 --> 38:07.868
a drone strike is
too good for them.

38:07.869 --> 38:09.495
Are we even sure

38:09.496 --> 38:11.376
that Mr. Wilson is the
father of this terrorist?

38:16.086 --> 38:17.586
Hmm?

38:17.587 --> 38:19.171
Automaker U.S. Motors,

38:19.172 --> 38:22.133
where terrorist harborer
Wayne Wilson once worked,

38:22.134 --> 38:24.885
announced today that, as
a gesture of apology,

38:24.886 --> 38:26.804
they will close their
Americaville plant,

38:26.805 --> 38:28.472
demolish it, burn the ruins,

38:28.473 --> 38:29.974
lock the ashes in a concrete vault,

38:29.975 --> 38:32.310
and bury the vault
under Giants Stadium.

38:32.311 --> 38:34.895
Would you mind if
we turned that off?

38:34.896 --> 38:37.398
Sorry. We're under orders
to make you watch it

38:37.399 --> 38:39.775
and keep TiVo-ing back
to the beginning.

38:39.776 --> 38:42.028
And they're the subject
of my new book,

38:42.029 --> 38:46.699
Killing the Wilsons.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.451
So that's your testimony.

38:48.452 --> 38:51.704
You had no idea this fella was
a terrorist or a skeleton?

38:51.705 --> 38:53.372
No, we just liked him.

38:53.373 --> 38:54.957
Okay, we're done here.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.667
Thank you.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.878
Maybe we can go back to some
version of our lives and-

38:58.879 --> 39:00.296
No, ma'am, you don't understand.

39:00.297 --> 39:02.524
I said we're done here.

39:07.179 --> 39:09.597
This is not the America
I grew up in.

39:09.598 --> 39:11.265
I advise you to be quiet.

39:11.266 --> 39:13.267
Anything you say may be
used against you at trial.

39:13.268 --> 39:15.644
Oh, there won't be a trial.

39:15.645 --> 39:17.330
Uh, no worries, then. Here we go.

39:21.485 --> 39:25.363
My friends,
today your new life begins,

39:25.364 --> 39:29.450
for just on the other side
of this tunnel is America

39:29.451 --> 39:33.537
and your new Home...
Depot parking lot.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.039
Yes!

39:35.040 --> 39:37.500
Oh, we are finally out
of that wretched place

39:37.501 --> 39:39.960
and away from those
horrible people.

39:39.961 --> 39:44.399
But you guys have fun.
Knock yourselves out.

39:49.971 --> 39:53.140
I can't believe the
Wilsons just gave me up

39:53.141 --> 39:55.142
after all we meant to each other.

39:55.143 --> 39:56.519
I broke bread with them.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.646
I put a bomb in their guest room.

39:58.647 --> 40:00.815
How could you let
yourself be brainwashed

40:00.816 --> 40:03.275
by those infidels, after
we spent so much time

40:03.276 --> 40:04.902
brainwashing you to hate them?

40:04.903 --> 40:07.738
I guess I am just washable.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.615
Soon this will all be over,

40:09.616 --> 40:12.785
and the decadent nation will
only be a bitter memory.

40:12.786 --> 40:15.621
Two tickets for the Third World,
please, first-class.

40:15.622 --> 40:17.915
May the Wilsons rot in hell!

40:17.916 --> 40:20.626
I am glad I will never
see them again.

40:20.627 --> 40:22.503
Wait. What's this?

40:22.504 --> 40:25.131
There we see the escaped
terrorist's accomplices

40:25.132 --> 40:26.424
being led away to prison.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.676
Terrorist lovers, go home!

40:28.677 --> 40:31.011
Go back to another country!

40:31.012 --> 40:32.638
They were not my accomplices.

40:32.639 --> 40:35.224
I was the mastermind
of this fiasco.

40:35.225 --> 40:36.892
If I could just say one thing...

40:36.893 --> 40:39.478
Claude, Achmed, wherever you are,

40:39.479 --> 40:41.689
if you can hear me...
I can!

40:41.690 --> 40:44.358
We know you're really a nice boy,

40:44.359 --> 40:47.837
and we hope you're okay.

40:49.406 --> 40:52.116
What?

40:52.117 --> 40:54.368
The Wilsons are put onto
the prison bus and...

40:54.369 --> 40:59.874
goooooooooal!

40:59.875 --> 41:02.585
I can't let the Wilsons become
the first innocent people

41:02.586 --> 41:04.795
ever wrongly imprisoned in America.

41:04.796 --> 41:07.298
Hassan, you must take me
back there to help them.

41:07.299 --> 41:08.883
You are insane.

41:08.884 --> 41:10.593
I wouldn't pay more
attention to the shrieks

41:10.594 --> 41:12.470
of a rabid water buffalo.

41:12.471 --> 41:15.097
Oh, yes, how is your wife?

41:15.098 --> 41:18.476
Zing, boom!
American put-down humor.

41:18.477 --> 41:21.061
For that, I should
kill until you are dead.

41:21.062 --> 41:23.564
But she is fine.
She's lost some weight.

41:23.565 --> 41:25.316
She's more cow than water buffalo.

41:25.317 --> 41:27.359
Anyway, come to your senses!

41:27.360 --> 41:30.946
Why do you want to go back to
that devil-filled country?

41:30.947 --> 41:33.073
All right, I will tell you.

41:33.074 --> 41:35.910
I want you to imagine a
place where all are equal

41:35.911 --> 41:39.330
and all are welcome, no
matter where you came from

41:39.331 --> 41:42.541
or who your father was or
how much land you own.

41:42.542 --> 41:45.836
It's a place dedicated to
the pursuit of happiness,

41:45.837 --> 41:49.298
where all the good things in
life are spread before you.

41:49.299 --> 41:53.260
And it is your right to take
as much as your heart desires.

41:53.261 --> 41:58.682
This place, my friend,
is called HomeBound Buffet.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.434
And America is filled with them.

42:00.435 --> 42:03.354
Loom

42:03.355 --> 42:07.775
These people-
they all seem so happy.

42:07.776 --> 42:10.945
That's what unlimited
buffet does for a nation.

42:10.946 --> 42:12.238
Unlimited?

42:12.239 --> 42:14.823
Surely there must be some limits.

42:14.824 --> 42:16.116
Nope.

42:16.117 --> 42:18.452
All right, they serve dinner, yes,

42:18.453 --> 42:20.663
but surely not desert.

42:20.664 --> 42:25.042
Bottomless frozen-yogurt bar
with all kinds of toppings-

42:25.043 --> 42:28.003
Oreo, Snickers, Cap'n Crunch.

42:28.004 --> 42:30.339
Don't say Butterfingers.
Don't say Butterfingers.

42:30.340 --> 42:32.216
Butterfingers.

42:32.217 --> 42:35.278
I must go there at once.

42:36.805 --> 42:39.306
Let me in!

42:39.307 --> 42:42.434
I must go to... Route 75, America,

42:42.435 --> 42:44.645
at the West Town
Country Mall at once.

42:44.646 --> 42:47.273
No! We have to save
the Wilsons first.

42:47.274 --> 42:49.900
Just a little fro-yo?
Okay.

42:49.901 --> 42:53.654
One standard serving of fro-yo,
no more than two toppings.

42:53.655 --> 42:54.756
Ooh, yay!

42:55.615 --> 42:56.782
Let us in!

42:56.783 --> 42:58.075
Hey, you.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.368
Get away from there.

42:59.369 --> 43:01.245
Holy crap. It's the po-po.

43:01.246 --> 43:04.081
That's the funny name they
have for police in America.

43:04.082 --> 43:05.499
I love it.

43:05.500 --> 43:08.210
I said get out of here. No entry!

43:08.211 --> 43:10.212
But we have to save our friends.

43:10.213 --> 43:12.339
The FBI thinks they are terrorists,

43:12.340 --> 43:13.841
but they're not.

43:13.842 --> 43:16.218
We are...

43:16.219 --> 43:18.804
is what a bad person would say

43:18.805 --> 43:21.390
in the scene from our
new Broadway musical,

43:21.391 --> 43:23.684
Les Mis Arabs.

43:23.685 --> 43:24.977
Uh, got to go!

43:24.978 --> 43:27.330
Terrorists! After 'em!

43:33.320 --> 43:36.822
Achmed, I am so sorry.
What do we do now?

43:36.823 --> 43:38.490
We do what Americans do.

43:38.491 --> 43:40.117
Eat?
No.

43:40.118 --> 43:42.745
What Americans do when
they run out of options.

43:42.746 --> 43:44.455
Throw a Hail Mary pass?

43:44.456 --> 43:46.206
Close. They pray.

43:46.207 --> 43:49.460
But we pray all the time,
like, 38 times a day.

43:49.461 --> 43:52.087
No, no, we have to
pray like Americans.

43:52.088 --> 43:53.672
How is that?

43:53.673 --> 43:56.050
They ask for things
like sports victories,

43:56.051 --> 43:59.053
no pregnancy, and
celebrity side boob.

43:59.054 --> 44:01.639
What do we pray for-side boob?

44:01.640 --> 44:03.366
No. A miracle.

44:11.858 --> 44:13.984
Aah!

44:13.985 --> 44:15.277
Side boob.

44:15.278 --> 44:17.338
Aah! Aah!

44:19.115 --> 44:20.616
It's American.

44:20.617 --> 44:23.160
Yes, bald eagle,
mighty American symbol,

44:23.161 --> 44:25.537
who is the second-place
choice after a turkey,

44:25.538 --> 44:27.998
take us into America.

44:27.999 --> 44:31.478
It's turban time!

45:07.080 --> 45:09.456
We have live team
coverage of the bus convoy

45:09.457 --> 45:11.875
as it slowly makes its way
down the main street

45:11.876 --> 45:14.712
of Americaville and
on to Guantanamo.

45:14.713 --> 45:17.172
Let's go now live to
our Madison Ashford,

45:17.173 --> 45:18.799
who's embedded with
the terrorist family

45:18.800 --> 45:20.718
and their captors.

45:20.719 --> 45:23.887
Dave, I'm here with the
terrorist sympathizers.

45:23.888 --> 45:26.932
We simply gave him a home.

45:26.933 --> 45:28.559
Confessed terrorist sympathizers

45:28.560 --> 45:30.894
as they head to their
well-earned imprisonment.

45:30.895 --> 45:34.732
There's no place like home.

45:34.733 --> 45:36.942
Another barrage of
eggs has hit the bus.

45:36.943 --> 45:39.278
That's why I'm in body armor.

45:39.279 --> 45:41.238
There's my Girl Scout leader

45:41.239 --> 45:44.575
and my civics teacher.

45:44.576 --> 45:46.577
Well, who threw all those?

45:46.578 --> 45:48.412
Father O'Malley and Rabbi Weisman

45:48.413 --> 45:51.599
are holding a slingshot
for Imam Abdullah.

45:54.252 --> 45:57.337
Well, at least we helped
bring some people together.

45:57.338 --> 46:00.507
Wilsons, if there's a hell,
you're going to it.

46:00.508 --> 46:02.009
Hey, when this is over,

46:02.010 --> 46:04.946
you guys want to walk into a bar?

46:09.976 --> 46:12.895
Oh.

46:12.896 --> 46:15.081
Oh!

46:18.777 --> 46:21.361
I am so full.

46:21.362 --> 46:23.631
I think America is going
to mean death to me.

46:24.949 --> 46:27.785
Funny. That could be the
title of your memoir.

46:27.786 --> 46:31.038
That's a little too
on the nose for me.

46:31.039 --> 46:33.832
I will ask the Wilsons
what they think about it.

46:33.833 --> 46:36.293
The Wilsons!
We've got to save them.

46:36.294 --> 46:38.128
Hassan, we must leave now,

46:38.129 --> 46:41.441
but stealthfully to
avoid detection.

46:44.594 --> 46:45.969
How was your meal, gentlemen?

46:45.970 --> 46:47.805
Oh, it was perfect, so delicious.

46:47.806 --> 46:49.431
But we have to go now.

46:49.432 --> 46:50.724
We're bringing out a new trough

46:50.725 --> 46:52.017
of Butterfinger pieces.

46:52.018 --> 46:54.269
How very fattening of you. Thanks.

46:54.270 --> 46:57.773
Are they freshly crumbled?
You bet ya.

46:57.774 --> 47:00.192
Much as we'd like to gorge
ourselves into an early grave,

47:00.193 --> 47:02.295
we really have to go... now!

47:04.739 --> 47:07.115
Charlie Sheen.

47:07.116 --> 47:08.867
Bush.
Is something wrong?

47:08.868 --> 47:11.161
Oh, no, it's all hunky-dory.

47:11.162 --> 47:12.663
What could be wrong?

47:12.664 --> 47:14.331
We've had our
ridiculously huge dinner,

47:14.332 --> 47:16.208
burped and farted to
our heart's content,

47:16.209 --> 47:19.020
and now we're leaving,
just like any other Americans-

47:21.965 --> 47:23.900
I look so young in that picture.

47:26.344 --> 47:28.679
Holy crap.

47:28.680 --> 47:31.849
Well, it looks like you've got us.

47:31.850 --> 47:33.725
Oh, look, they're putting
out more pizza bread.

47:33.726 --> 47:36.704
Ooh!
Go! Go, go, go, go!

48:00.169 --> 48:02.546
More sprinkles, please.

48:02.547 --> 48:05.400
Oh, and some fresh bread.

48:20.231 --> 48:24.693
Wow. This country
throws out so many cars.

48:24.694 --> 48:26.278
It's fantastic!

48:26.279 --> 48:27.905
I know, right?

48:27.906 --> 48:29.448
This is not good.

48:29.449 --> 48:32.200
The Wilsons need me,
and I've let them down.

48:32.201 --> 48:34.912
The least I can do,
in case we don't make it,

48:34.913 --> 48:37.831
is write a note that clears them.

48:37.832 --> 48:39.249
Can it be?

48:39.250 --> 48:41.752
Hassan, how are you
at building things?

48:41.753 --> 48:43.837
Not as good as blowing things up.

48:43.838 --> 48:45.422
That's going to have to change.

48:45.423 --> 48:48.884
Grab that welding crap
and come with me.

48:48.885 --> 48:52.113
What are we building?
You'll see!

49:00.730 --> 49:02.606
These are hurting my wrists.

49:02.607 --> 49:05.984
Sorry, ma'am. I'm under orders.

49:05.985 --> 49:09.112
All right.

49:09.113 --> 49:10.822
You can do that?

49:10.823 --> 49:12.741
It's highly classified.

49:12.742 --> 49:14.701
So are you.

49:14.702 --> 49:17.037
I'm not sure you know
what that word means,

49:17.038 --> 49:18.973
but thank you.

49:21.209 --> 49:25.229
Ooh, Chris Matthews is going
to get moist over this.

49:27.173 --> 49:29.633
Honey, ain't this the
best anniversary present,

49:29.634 --> 49:31.969
seeing our neighbors go to prison?

49:31.970 --> 49:33.720
Jewelry's nice.

49:33.721 --> 49:35.782
Hey, what song should I play now?

49:37.016 --> 49:39.017
How about America, Eff Yeah,

49:39.018 --> 49:40.852
from that Team America movie?

49:40.853 --> 49:42.854
That song is ironic, Chet.

49:42.855 --> 49:45.583
It ain't ironic if you
don't get the joke.

49:48.528 --> 49:50.112
Ow!

49:50.113 --> 49:51.822
That better be cage-free.

49:51.823 --> 49:55.093
Bite my justice, you
arugula-eating left turd!

49:57.036 --> 49:58.328
Now, I know things look bad,

49:58.329 --> 50:00.122
but we can't just give up.

50:00.123 --> 50:01.915
We have to maintain hope

50:01.916 --> 50:04.918
that something or
someone can save us.

50:04.919 --> 50:06.920
That's right, kids.

50:06.921 --> 50:08.922
We have to hope for
something better

50:08.923 --> 50:10.882
because that's what we do.

50:10.883 --> 50:14.052
I don't know who will help us.
It could be a stranger.

50:14.053 --> 50:16.013
It could be someone who
hasn't been born yet.

50:16.014 --> 50:17.723
It could be-

50:17.724 --> 50:19.182
Flaming skull!

50:19.183 --> 50:20.767
Is that a superhero?

50:20.768 --> 50:23.412
No, it's a flaming skull!

50:27.692 --> 50:30.652
Greetings, infidels!

50:30.653 --> 50:32.362
It's Claude.

50:32.363 --> 50:35.091
My name is Achmed!

50:46.252 --> 50:50.088
Girl car!

50:50.089 --> 50:52.841
Wiener substitute!

50:52.842 --> 50:54.861
Ah, hell, no.

50:57.638 --> 50:59.139
Leave him alone, Chet!

50:59.140 --> 51:01.016
You're what's wrong with America!

51:01.017 --> 51:03.351
No! You're what's
wrong with America!

51:03.352 --> 51:04.644
Americaw!

51:04.645 --> 51:08.690
Gentlemen, you are both correct!

51:08.691 --> 51:11.151
Hey, what the... Get out of my way!

51:11.152 --> 51:12.444
I hate you, Chet!

51:12.445 --> 51:13.737
Damn-
I've always hated you!

51:13.738 --> 51:15.030
Turd car!

51:15.031 --> 51:18.033
Hey.

51:18.034 --> 51:19.451
Oh. Sorry.

51:19.452 --> 51:20.744
No worries.

51:20.745 --> 51:23.789
We've got Obamacare.

51:23.790 --> 51:27.084
Hello, Wilsons! I love you!

51:27.085 --> 51:28.543
Whoa!

51:28.544 --> 51:31.421
Even you, you little backstabber!

51:31.422 --> 51:33.298
Thanks, Achmed.

51:33.299 --> 51:36.301
I still say he's a bad man!

51:36.302 --> 51:39.012
Someone has been practicing!

51:39.013 --> 51:40.781
Thanks!

51:43.226 --> 51:48.688
Great Hoover's pantyhose.
What the hell?

51:48.689 --> 51:50.941
I am turning myself in.

51:50.942 --> 51:52.317
He's turning himself into a bomb.

51:52.318 --> 51:54.778
I think he said,
"Turning myself in."

51:54.779 --> 51:56.822
When did you graduate
from Quantico?

51:56.823 --> 51:58.115
Prepare to fire.

51:58.116 --> 52:01.076
How is it going?

52:01.077 --> 52:02.869
Been better, been worse.

52:02.870 --> 52:06.123
Don't shoot! Please, hear him out.

52:06.124 --> 52:09.876
Ladies and gentlemen
and big dangerous guns,

52:09.877 --> 52:12.671
I came back to tell you that
these wonderful people,

52:12.672 --> 52:16.591
the Wilsons, do not deserve
to be taken to prison.

52:16.592 --> 52:18.718
I do.

52:18.719 --> 52:21.638
Wait, wait, wait.
Why did we all just gasp?

52:21.639 --> 52:23.265
We know he should go to prison.

52:23.266 --> 52:24.558
I don't know.

52:24.559 --> 52:26.268
I feel kind of stupid
about that now.

52:26.269 --> 52:28.061
It's true that I came here

52:28.062 --> 52:29.938
with the intent of doing you harm,

52:29.939 --> 52:31.773
but that is all over.

52:31.774 --> 52:34.401
And the Wilsons had
nothing to do with it

52:34.402 --> 52:36.820
because they are
decent, kind people,

52:36.821 --> 52:39.156
like Americans everywhere.

52:39.157 --> 52:41.158
Let me know when you got the shot.

52:41.159 --> 52:43.201
Roger that.

52:43.202 --> 52:47.122
The Wilsons' only crime
was seeing the best in me,

52:47.123 --> 52:51.001
and my only crime was not
seeing the best in them...

52:51.002 --> 52:54.004
and plotting to blow up the
whole town, yada, yada.

52:54.005 --> 52:55.922
If I may say a word or two.

52:55.923 --> 52:58.842
Of course, sir.
Where's my kill shot, people?

52:58.843 --> 53:00.218
I don't see him.

53:00.219 --> 53:02.512
Oh, wait.

53:02.513 --> 53:04.556
That's better. We're clear.

53:04.557 --> 53:06.433
Subject is in the target zone.

53:06.434 --> 53:08.351
On my command, in three...

53:08.352 --> 53:09.769
I'd like to say a few words

53:09.770 --> 53:12.439
about this remarkable young man.

53:12.440 --> 53:14.941
Hey, whoever is playing
with that laser pen out there

53:14.942 --> 53:16.484
should really stop.

53:16.485 --> 53:18.028
You could detach a retina.

53:18.029 --> 53:19.321
They're going to shoot him.

53:19.322 --> 53:20.906
..Two, one, f-

53:20.907 --> 53:23.200
Sniper team, stand down!

53:23.201 --> 53:24.784
What-
Who is that?

53:24.785 --> 53:26.578
I said stand down!

53:26.579 --> 53:28.705
That is a direct order!

53:28.706 --> 53:30.457
This is General Charles McCarthy

53:30.458 --> 53:32.334
of the United States Joint Command,

53:32.335 --> 53:35.712
and I order you to stand down now!

53:35.713 --> 53:37.130
That's better.

53:37.131 --> 53:39.799
It's a miracle.
Kind of.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.987
Now toss your weapons
in that drainage ditch.

53:45.014 --> 53:47.599
And let Mr. Wilson speak.

53:47.600 --> 53:49.559
Thank you, General McCarthy.

53:49.560 --> 53:51.912
And thank you, son.

53:58.611 --> 54:00.820
Why ain't they shooting him?
He's right there.

54:00.821 --> 54:02.572
He's surrendering peacefully.

54:02.573 --> 54:04.241
Not in my America.

54:04.242 --> 54:05.909
Now, dear, this ain't right.

54:05.910 --> 54:09.513
Why can't you be more
supportive of my hobbies?

54:11.415 --> 54:13.517
That is not good.

54:17.922 --> 54:20.090
I can see my cave from here.

54:20.091 --> 54:23.009
Au revoir, you
towel-headed French fry.

54:23.010 --> 54:26.221
Now, Chet!
Don't "now, Chet" me.

54:26.222 --> 54:28.515
He got what he deserved.

54:28.516 --> 54:30.767
You do good things,
and you'll be rewarded.

54:30.768 --> 54:33.937
You do bad things,
and it's hasta la bye-bye.

54:33.938 --> 54:36.564
Hiya, Chet.

54:36.565 --> 54:38.376
Save me, Sean Hannity!

54:42.071 --> 54:45.365
No! My fuel-efficient hybrid!

54:45.366 --> 54:47.134
My lower torso.

54:59.171 --> 55:01.423
Anyway, you were saying.

55:01.424 --> 55:04.634
How can you still be alive?
I think I know.

55:04.635 --> 55:08.138
Because the American
dream burns within him.

55:08.139 --> 55:10.640
Actually, that's a
piece of shrapnel.

55:10.641 --> 55:12.225
But I feel you.

55:12.226 --> 55:14.811
This amazing young
man, this skeleton-

55:14.812 --> 55:17.647
Yes, I admit now he is
just a talking skeleton.

55:17.648 --> 55:19.983
No offense.
Please. We're past that.

55:19.984 --> 55:21.651
He stays alive

55:21.652 --> 55:25.822
because he believes in the
America we all believe in,

55:25.823 --> 55:28.867
a place where you can
make a fresh start

55:28.868 --> 55:30.744
no matter where you came from,

55:30.745 --> 55:32.829
where you can arrive
in this country

55:32.830 --> 55:34.831
without a dollar in your pocket,

55:34.832 --> 55:37.417
change your name, and
make a new life.

55:37.418 --> 55:40.128
It happened to someone
you might have heard of,

55:40.129 --> 55:43.774
someone named Miss Shania Twain.

55:45.301 --> 55:47.594
She's not American?
Canadian.

55:47.595 --> 55:49.554
No.

55:49.555 --> 55:51.639
Who's Shania Twain?

55:51.640 --> 55:53.892
I love Shania Twain.

55:53.893 --> 55:55.769
You do?

55:55.770 --> 55:59.856
So, to quote one of Shania
Twain's biggest hits-

55:59.857 --> 56:01.399
Man! I Feel Like a Woman!?

56:01.400 --> 56:02.692
No.

56:02.693 --> 56:04.361
Let's find a new spirit

56:04.362 --> 56:06.654
of cooperation and forgiveness.

56:06.655 --> 56:08.156
That Don't Impress Me Much?

56:08.157 --> 56:10.075
Not that one either.
I'm getting there.

56:10.076 --> 56:12.077
Let's put our hearts together and-

56:12.078 --> 56:13.870
Well, those were two
of her biggest hits

56:13.871 --> 56:15.163
according to Billboard's
country-western charts-

56:15.164 --> 56:17.499
Silence!
You were saying?

56:17.500 --> 56:19.876
Let's make a new Americaville

56:19.877 --> 56:25.006
and a new America
from this moment on!

56:25.007 --> 56:27.509
Aw!

56:27.510 --> 56:30.446
Okay, that was big too.

56:33.391 --> 56:36.577
Come here.

56:45.319 --> 56:48.321
I guess there's
nobody for me to hug.

56:48.322 --> 56:51.241
Is this your stupid
little annoying dog?

56:51.242 --> 56:52.826
Billy!
Billy?

56:52.827 --> 56:54.828
I do not know who
you're talking to.

56:54.829 --> 56:56.329
My name is Claude.

56:56.330 --> 56:58.957
No, silly, the dog's name is Bill.

56:58.958 --> 57:01.876
You Americans give
your dogs people names?

57:01.877 --> 57:04.355
You are as dimwitted
as you are boring.

57:06.507 --> 57:09.426
I think I just got
shot with an arrow.

57:09.427 --> 57:11.803
Uh, you can all go home.
Sorry about that.

57:11.804 --> 57:13.179
That's okay.

57:13.180 --> 57:15.181
And Achmed is free
to go too, right?

57:15.182 --> 57:16.474
Uh...

57:16.475 --> 57:18.560
No, I am a criminal after all.

57:18.561 --> 57:20.979
I do not think there
is a Shania Twain song

57:20.980 --> 57:23.565
to help me escape paying
my debt to society.

57:23.566 --> 57:26.109
No One Needs to
Know is appropriate.

57:26.110 --> 57:28.653
Loom

57:28.654 --> 57:31.448
How do you like that?
It's the President!

57:31.449 --> 57:32.866
Of the United States?

57:32.867 --> 57:35.844
Yes, the United
States Motor Company!

57:37.621 --> 57:40.498
Uh, Mr. Achmed,

57:40.499 --> 57:44.544
I've just spoken to the Attorney
General, and based on my offer

57:44.545 --> 57:47.255
to personally vouch for your
renunciation of terrorism

57:47.256 --> 57:50.467
and the fact that you never
accomplished anything destructive...

57:50.468 --> 57:52.218
It's true. He blows.

57:52.219 --> 57:54.387
...our government is
prepared to grant you a full,

57:54.388 --> 57:56.306
complete, and unconditional pardon.

57:56.307 --> 57:58.183
Yay!

57:58.184 --> 58:00.685
On one condition.
Boo!

58:00.686 --> 58:03.354
That you share with me the
plans for that amazing car

58:03.355 --> 58:05.064
that you just drove here today.

58:05.065 --> 58:07.525
My car?

58:07.526 --> 58:10.320
Yes, you've done the
seemingly impossible.

58:10.321 --> 58:12.947
You've created an
American-made automobile

58:12.948 --> 58:16.242
in America that Americans
actually want to buy.

58:16.243 --> 58:18.369
It is a bad-ass ride.

58:18.370 --> 58:20.622
It's a deal.
Yay!

58:20.623 --> 58:22.290
On one condition.

58:22.291 --> 58:23.750
Boo!

58:23.751 --> 58:26.002
No, no, it's a good condition.

58:26.003 --> 58:27.712
Yay!
Yay?

58:27.713 --> 58:29.923
The condition is you give credit

58:29.924 --> 58:33.927
to the man who actually designed
this car, Wayne Wilson.

58:33.928 --> 58:35.637
I thought that looked familiar.

58:35.638 --> 58:37.138
It should.

58:37.139 --> 58:39.516
Hassan and I built it
based on your drawing.

58:39.517 --> 58:41.476
The flaming skull was me.

58:41.477 --> 58:44.604
Hey, everyone, Carl and I are
opening a bed-and-breakfast.

58:44.605 --> 58:45.980
Sorry, Ev.

58:45.981 --> 58:47.815
Well, I wondered
when you were gonna

58:47.816 --> 58:49.359
finally figure yourself out.

58:49.360 --> 58:50.985
Go be happy.

58:50.986 --> 58:53.655
Just leave me and Stan the
beach house in Roanoke.

58:53.656 --> 58:55.657
Stan?
Good-bye!

58:55.658 --> 58:58.576
I was a terrible mayor.

58:58.577 --> 59:01.287
This is the country
you want to live in?

59:01.288 --> 59:03.081
There is not a better one.

59:03.082 --> 59:04.832
Then maybe you can be a reference

59:04.833 --> 59:07.961
for my job application?

59:07.962 --> 59:12.131
Former terrorist log,
love date 8/3/13.

59:12.132 --> 59:14.551
I am now a citizen of Americaville.

59:14.552 --> 59:16.553
It's a good life.

59:16.554 --> 59:20.265
Wayne and Ginny have found
their true calling.

59:20.266 --> 59:24.269
The kids are having fun.

59:24.270 --> 59:26.104
I've found a job where
I can use my skills

59:26.105 --> 59:28.898
and make people happy.

59:28.899 --> 59:31.234
And once a week,
we all get together

59:31.235 --> 59:35.005
for a bountiful feast.

59:38.367 --> 59:42.078
Yes, all in all, it's
been one incredible year,

59:42.079 --> 59:46.499
and the next one
will be even better.

59:46.500 --> 59:49.377
Good night, Wayne.
Good night, Achmed.

59:49.378 --> 59:52.171
Good night, Ginny.
Good night, Achmed.

59:52.172 --> 59:54.132
Good night, Cassidy.
Good night, Kevin.

59:54.133 --> 59:55.550
Good night, little Jeff.

59:55.551 --> 59:57.594
Good night.
Good night!

59:57.595 --> 01:00:00.888
Good night, dog with the
dynamite in his mouth.

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:02.599
Uh-oh.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.118
Good boy.
