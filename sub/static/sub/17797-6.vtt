00:06.995 --> 00:08.454
<i>Previously on The Affair...</i>

00:08.560 --> 00:11.002
Just because he was convicted
doesn't mean he's guilty.

00:11.003 --> 00:13.741
The only person who doesn't
think he did it is you.

00:13.742 --> 00:15.278
<i>This isn't a relationship.</i>

00:15.279 --> 00:16.613
We live completely separate lives.

00:16.614 --> 00:19.119
My place, your place. My bed, your bed.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.559
My kids, your... your... your cactus.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.029
Home sweet home.

00:24.030 --> 00:25.967
Come and say
good-bye to your father.

00:28.773 --> 00:30.107
His advisor wants to have

00:30.108 --> 00:31.778
a parent/teacher conference next week.

00:31.779 --> 00:34.450
- I think you should be there.
- Okay, I'll try.

00:35.954 --> 00:36.988
Noah?

00:36.989 --> 00:38.625
I'm here.

00:38.626 --> 00:40.496
<i>I'm sorry to have scared you.</i>

00:40.497 --> 00:42.733
<i>Honestly, I wasn't scared.
I was angry.</i>

00:42.734 --> 00:46.941
I was hoping that this
wouldn't be so complicated.

00:48.412 --> 00:49.814
<i>I don't want the house.</i>

00:49.815 --> 00:51.251
Dad left it to you.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.786
I'm never going back there, Nina.

00:52.787 --> 00:55.259
He was trying to apologize.

00:55.260 --> 00:57.263
<i>My mother died there.</i>

00:57.264 --> 00:58.498
She was sick for a long time,

00:58.499 --> 01:02.072
and she told me that she decided to die.

01:02.073 --> 01:03.542
You don't remember me, do you?

01:03.543 --> 01:06.214
John Gunther. I'm from Bloomsburg.

01:06.215 --> 01:08.719
Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania?

01:12.394 --> 01:14.330
Fuck.

02:50.159 --> 02:51.293
Are you sure she's gonna make it?

02:51.294 --> 02:53.966
Yeah, she's just running late.

02:53.967 --> 02:56.972
How long have you
been dating this woman?

02:56.973 --> 02:58.507
On and off for a while now.

02:58.508 --> 03:00.211
How come you've never mentioned her?

03:00.212 --> 03:02.148
Well, I know how sensitive
you are, darling.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.752
I wouldn't want you to be heartbroken

03:03.753 --> 03:05.757
if it didn't work out between us.

03:08.763 --> 03:10.966
So what's she like?

03:10.967 --> 03:13.605
You know, she's... a lot like you.

03:13.606 --> 03:14.941
Like me?

03:14.942 --> 03:17.145
Ta-da.

03:17.146 --> 03:18.982
Hello, darling.

03:18.983 --> 03:20.854
Mom?

03:24.528 --> 03:26.665
Surprise.

03:26.666 --> 03:28.669
Okay, what is happening here?

03:28.670 --> 03:30.674
We're back together.

03:41.062 --> 03:43.866
Well, it's... it's really
great to finally meet you, Vik.

03:43.867 --> 03:45.269
We've heard so much about you.

03:45.270 --> 03:46.906
I haven't heard about him.

03:46.907 --> 03:49.912
Well, neither have I, really,
but, he seems great.

03:49.913 --> 03:52.183
Well, I'm happy to meet you guys, too.

03:52.184 --> 03:54.455
I mean, it's taken long enough.

03:54.456 --> 03:56.258
Congrats on your remarriage.

03:56.259 --> 03:58.930
Okay, you're not actually
getting remarried, are you?

03:58.931 --> 04:01.535
Well, we never really
finalized the divorce.

04:01.536 --> 04:04.641
Okay, well, when did you
even start talking?

04:04.642 --> 04:06.746
Let's not discuss the details.

04:06.747 --> 04:10.822
Ina left me, and, I
went back to your mom.

04:12.525 --> 04:14.929
Aren't you happy for us, Helen?

04:14.930 --> 04:16.767
Sure, yeah. I'm thrilled.

04:16.767 --> 04:18.670
Well, I'm
thrilled for you, darling.

04:18.671 --> 04:20.507
This fella's quite a catch.

04:20.509 --> 04:23.179
I don't understand why you
kept him hidden all this time.

04:23.180 --> 04:27.020
He's wonderful... handsome,
polite, a doctor.

04:27.021 --> 04:28.590
And at your age, Helen...

04:28.591 --> 04:29.859
See, she's not really thinking

04:29.860 --> 04:31.263
about the words before she says them.

04:31.264 --> 04:32.765
It's just pure stream of consciousness,

04:32.766 --> 04:34.202
what you're hearing right now.

04:34.203 --> 04:35.938
- I like it.
- Of course.

04:35.939 --> 04:38.577
Anyone would be an improvement
after your first husband.

04:38.578 --> 04:40.714
So how is Noah?

04:40.715 --> 04:41.951
Do they know who stabbed him?

04:41.952 --> 04:43.587
No, they don't.

04:43.588 --> 04:45.124
I wish I'd thought of
that myself years ago.

04:45.125 --> 04:46.994
Could've saved my family
a lot of heartache.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.430
Dad. Hey, hey.

04:48.431 --> 04:50.234
He's kidding.

04:50.235 --> 04:51.971
I don't care if he's kidding.

04:51.972 --> 04:53.908
You can't say things like that.

04:53.909 --> 04:55.679
He's the father of your grandchildren.

04:55.680 --> 04:58.250
Well, he hasn't really seen
very much of them recently,

04:58.251 --> 04:59.854
has he?

04:59.855 --> 05:01.356
Doesn't make much of
a difference to them

05:01.357 --> 05:03.428
if he's locked away in
jail or if he's dead.

05:03.429 --> 05:05.298
Of course it makes a difference.

05:05.299 --> 05:07.135
He's still very much
involved in their lives.

05:07.136 --> 05:09.072
As a matter of fact, he's coming
to Martin's school tomorrow

05:09.073 --> 05:10.242
to meet with his advisor.

05:10.243 --> 05:11.811
Christ.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.481
That's a dreadful idea.

05:13.482 --> 05:15.952
You're trying to impress
them, not terrify them.

05:15.953 --> 05:17.556
You should take Vik.

05:17.557 --> 05:18.825
I'd be happy to go.

05:18.826 --> 05:20.462
Can we please change the subject?

05:20.463 --> 05:23.401
Good idea. This is
supposed to be a happy occasion,

05:23.402 --> 05:26.274
and as usual, Noah
Solloway is ruining it.

05:26.275 --> 05:29.580
So how is married life
treating you guys?

05:29.581 --> 05:32.152
- It's wonderful.
- That's so sweet.

05:32.153 --> 05:33.288
We realized we couldn't live

05:33.289 --> 05:34.758
without each other, right, dear?

05:34.759 --> 05:35.927
That's right.

05:35.928 --> 05:39.099
The truth is, at the end of the day,

05:39.100 --> 05:42.039
your mother just knows me...

05:42.040 --> 05:44.778
better than anyone else ever will.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.682
That's beautiful.

05:51.659 --> 05:53.997
Ooh.

05:53.998 --> 05:55.366
- Your parents are insane.
- I told you.

05:55.367 --> 05:57.136
But they're entertaining.

05:57.137 --> 05:58.840
And it's great they're back together.

05:58.841 --> 06:01.678
Vik, my father walked out
on my mother with a student

06:01.679 --> 06:02.982
and completely ruined her life,

06:02.983 --> 06:04.517
and now she's just taking him back

06:04.518 --> 06:06.088
and pretending that none
of it ever happened.

06:06.089 --> 06:08.492
It's not great. It's pathetic.

06:08.493 --> 06:12.601
And, my God, all that
bullshit about second chances...

06:12.602 --> 06:15.139
and how they know each other?

06:15.140 --> 06:16.709
You know what? The only thing they know

06:16.710 --> 06:18.880
about each other is that
they hate each other.

06:18.881 --> 06:21.319
I'm still glad you introduced us.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.191
It feels like a big step.

06:24.192 --> 06:25.560
Hey...

06:25.561 --> 06:27.498
- I have an idea.
- What?

06:27.499 --> 06:28.533
A joint wedding.

06:28.534 --> 06:30.137
Excuse me?

06:30.138 --> 06:33.710
Yeah, your parents renew their
vows, and we get hitched.

06:33.711 --> 06:36.015
I'll bet your dad would even pay for it.

06:36.016 --> 06:38.254
Think of all the money we'd save.

06:40.693 --> 06:42.696
You are joking, right?

06:42.697 --> 06:44.766
Of course I'm joking, Helen.

06:44.767 --> 06:46.771
Don't have a heart attack.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.277
You're hilarious, you know that?

06:50.278 --> 06:51.714
Did you ever think about
giving up surgery,

06:51.715 --> 06:53.617
going into stand-up comedy?

06:53.618 --> 06:54.953
Yes, I have.

07:05.977 --> 07:08.347
He's coming. He knows how
important the meeting is.

07:08.348 --> 07:09.683
He's not coming.

07:09.684 --> 07:10.752
Yeah, I'm sure he's coming.

07:10.753 --> 07:12.088
He's definitely not coming.

07:12.089 --> 07:13.257
Well, unfortunately,

07:13.258 --> 07:15.061
the period is now half over.

07:15.062 --> 07:18.000
We must have our discussion
with or without Mr. Solloway.

07:18.001 --> 07:20.505
Um...

07:20.506 --> 07:23.077
yeah, okay, I-I understand. Go ahead.

07:23.078 --> 07:25.415
Well, as a matter
of fact, Mr. Solloway's absence

07:25.416 --> 07:27.620
provides us with a bit of a segue

07:27.621 --> 07:29.891
into the dilemma we face.

07:29.892 --> 07:31.728
- A segue?
- Yes.

07:31.729 --> 07:34.267
You see, our problem is that Martin,

07:34.268 --> 07:38.876
far too frequently, chooses
not to come to school.

07:40.947 --> 07:42.716
What do you mean he chooses
not to come to school?

07:42.717 --> 07:44.120
Have you been cutting class?

07:44.121 --> 07:46.491
We give the
seniors a heavy workload

07:46.492 --> 07:48.128
to prepare them for what
they'll face in college.

07:48.129 --> 07:50.132
Now, at this rate, Martin's chances

07:50.133 --> 07:51.802
of finishing the required courses

07:51.803 --> 07:55.075
and successfully
graduating in the spring,

07:55.076 --> 07:57.012
well, they're rapidly diminishing.

07:57.013 --> 08:00.653
But he's... I mean, he... he
had to leave public school.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.557
This is his second senior year.

08:02.558 --> 08:04.361
I mean, he's 19 years old.
He can't repeat again.

08:04.362 --> 08:08.436
Well, precisely. This
is his last chance.

08:08.437 --> 08:10.240
I don't... What...
what is going on here?

08:10.241 --> 08:13.546
Where have you even been going?

08:13.547 --> 08:16.418
I'm... listen, obviously,
this is unacceptable,

08:16.419 --> 08:19.725
and I won't tolerate it, but I just...
I do...

08:19.726 --> 08:21.462
Um...

08:21.463 --> 08:23.399
I just want you to understand

08:23.400 --> 08:24.969
what's been going on with Martin.

08:24.970 --> 08:27.307
He's had a very difficult few years.

08:27.308 --> 08:29.278
He was diagnosed with Crohn's disease,

08:29.279 --> 08:30.948
which is why he had to
leave public school.

08:30.949 --> 08:33.921
He was legitimately very sick.

08:33.922 --> 08:37.327
So is that what's going on, Mr.
Solloway?

08:37.328 --> 08:40.333
You feeling too
sick to come to school?

08:42.639 --> 08:44.643
Answer him.

08:45.812 --> 08:49.152
I feel okay.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.690
You know what? You and I are
gonna talk this through tonight,

08:51.691 --> 08:53.327
and you are gonna give
me some answers, okay?

08:53.328 --> 08:54.530
I mean it.

08:57.469 --> 09:00.174
I don't know how much you know about...
about his father.

09:00.175 --> 09:02.011
Don't bring him into this.

09:02.012 --> 09:03.948
But it's been a very difficult
time for the entire family.

09:03.949 --> 09:05.685
- I'm aware.
- And my husband is...

09:05.686 --> 09:06.687
he's innocent.

09:06.688 --> 09:08.992
Ex-husband.

09:08.993 --> 09:11.129
My ex-husband is completely innocent.

09:11.130 --> 09:12.699
I have to go to lunch.

09:12.700 --> 09:14.102
Well, we're not done here.

09:14.103 --> 09:15.939
Well, I would say we are.

09:15.940 --> 09:18.310
You know, Martin should go to lunch,

09:18.311 --> 09:21.350
and as you promised, Mrs., um...

09:21.351 --> 09:23.053
Solloway. It's still Solloway.

09:23.054 --> 09:24.857
Well, as you said, the two of you

09:24.858 --> 09:26.694
will discuss this at home.

09:26.695 --> 09:28.865
And, Martin, I trust you understand

09:28.866 --> 09:32.205
how high the stakes are for you.

09:37.050 --> 09:38.751
What is the matter with you?

09:38.752 --> 09:40.488
I mean, seriously?

09:40.489 --> 09:42.225
I can't believe you actually
thought he was gonna show up.

09:42.226 --> 09:43.762
Look, he wanted to be here, Martin...
I know that he did.

09:43.763 --> 09:44.998
No, he didn't.

09:44.999 --> 09:46.702
He just got released from the hospital.

09:46.703 --> 09:48.371
I don't know. Maybe there
were some complications.

09:48.372 --> 09:49.373
- Maybe he's... I don't.
- I don't care.

09:49.374 --> 09:50.943
I don't fucking care!

09:50.944 --> 09:52.580
You shouldn't have even told
him about this meeting.

09:52.581 --> 09:54.183
He shouldn't be in our lives anymore.

09:54.184 --> 09:56.354
He killed someone, Mom!

09:56.355 --> 09:58.593
Why can't you just admit that?

10:00.363 --> 10:02.200
I got to go.

10:13.156 --> 10:17.163
God damn it, Noah, pick
up your fucking phone!

11:02.857 --> 11:05.026
Helen.

11:05.027 --> 11:06.697
What are you doing here?

11:06.698 --> 11:09.369
I was in the neighborhood,
and I thought I'd stop by.

11:11.039 --> 11:13.009
This neighborhood?

11:13.010 --> 11:15.214
Yeah, well, nearby. Can I come in?

11:15.215 --> 11:17.952
Yeah, I'm... Yeah, sorry. I'm just...

11:17.953 --> 11:20.359
putting away some groceries and stuff.

11:23.832 --> 11:27.205
Sorry. You... you
want a drink or...?

11:27.206 --> 11:28.975
Is Noah here?

11:28.976 --> 11:31.982
No. No, he isn't.

11:33.686 --> 11:36.423
You know where he is?

11:36.424 --> 11:38.327
Livingston, I assume?

11:38.328 --> 11:39.931
No, I don't think so, because I've been

11:39.932 --> 11:41.935
calling him and calling him,
and his phone is turned off.

11:41.936 --> 11:43.605
It's been turned off all day,
and there was a meeting today

11:43.606 --> 11:46.176
at Martin's school, and it
was an important meeting,

11:46.177 --> 11:50.117
and he didn't show up, so I'm just...
I'm...

11:50.118 --> 11:51.689
Do you think something happened to him?

11:52.791 --> 11:54.460
What time was the meeting?

11:54.461 --> 11:56.564
Noon. Why?

11:56.565 --> 11:59.370
Well, noon?

11:59.371 --> 12:01.474
Noon in the city, and...

12:01.475 --> 12:05.716
you made your way out to
New Jersey hours later?

12:05.717 --> 12:08.723
You okay, Helen?

12:08.724 --> 12:10.860
Yeah, I'm just... He... you know, he...

12:10.861 --> 12:12.931
I'm concerned about him
because he was stabbed,

12:12.932 --> 12:14.736
and now he's MIA.

12:17.273 --> 12:19.210
Can I ask you a question?

12:19.211 --> 12:20.446
Yeah.

12:20.447 --> 12:24.120
Why does he still matter so much to you?

12:24.121 --> 12:25.957
Because he's the father of my children,

12:25.958 --> 12:27.427
and he's blowing his last chance

12:27.428 --> 12:30.299
to have any semblance of a
relationship with them.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.904
I get that. I do. I-I really do.

12:32.905 --> 12:37.047
I understand about the
kids, but maybe...

12:37.048 --> 12:41.088
maybe it's best for
all of you just to...

12:41.089 --> 12:43.760
let him go.

12:43.761 --> 12:45.129
What?

12:45.130 --> 12:48.269
My brother's fucked up, you know.

12:48.270 --> 12:50.607
- He always has been.
- No, that's not true.

12:50.608 --> 12:52.913
He wasn't fucked up when I met him.

12:57.288 --> 13:00.159
You never saw it. Right.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.765
After all those years together...

13:02.766 --> 13:06.306
Yet... wow.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.741
Yet what?

13:07.742 --> 13:09.112
It's... it's actually... it's funny.

13:09.113 --> 13:11.149
It really is. I could never figure out

13:11.150 --> 13:14.088
if you were purposely
ignoring who he actually was

13:14.089 --> 13:16.292
or you were just so narcissistic

13:16.293 --> 13:17.628
that you weren't paying attention.

13:17.629 --> 13:18.931
Excuse me?

13:18.932 --> 13:22.906
My brother was shattered
when you met him.

13:22.907 --> 13:26.680
Our mother had just died, and I
don't know if you know, but...

13:26.681 --> 13:28.651
You know, maybe he hid
it really well from you.

13:28.652 --> 13:30.955
I knew he was grieving, Nina.

13:30.956 --> 13:32.792
It's one of the things
that drew me to him.

13:32.793 --> 13:34.663
I'm a caretaker. That's my archetype.

13:34.664 --> 13:36.634
Helen, okay, look,

13:36.635 --> 13:38.838
I know you thought you found
a diamond in the rough

13:38.839 --> 13:40.775
that you were just
gonna polish and shape

13:40.776 --> 13:42.345
and place on your dainty fingers and...

13:42.346 --> 13:43.548
- What? What?
- You know, like he was

13:43.549 --> 13:44.883
some lost deer,

13:44.884 --> 13:47.289
and somehow you rescued
him from obscurity

13:47.290 --> 13:51.497
and transplanted him into your...
your little fancy life.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.503
Let me tell you what
actually was going on.

13:54.504 --> 13:56.808
Noah was using you.

13:56.809 --> 13:59.313
He was using you to get
the fuck away from us,

13:59.314 --> 14:01.083
and he knew the fastest way to do that

14:01.084 --> 14:05.826
was to marry some
control-freak rich girl.

14:05.827 --> 14:07.329
What is wrong with you?

14:07.330 --> 14:09.968
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

14:09.969 --> 14:12.373
Didn't you find it odd
how Noah didn't...

14:12.374 --> 14:15.446
didn't mind at all spending
every holiday with your family,

14:15.447 --> 14:17.283
never once taking a vacation with us?

14:17.284 --> 14:20.021
Because it was difficult
for him to be with Arthur.

14:20.022 --> 14:21.791
Why?

14:21.792 --> 14:23.161
Because your father wasn't
very nice to him, Nina.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.530
- Why not?
- I don't know.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.532
Because he's an asshole.

14:25.533 --> 14:27.069
No! Actually, he wasn't!

14:27.070 --> 14:29.040
He wasn't to me!

14:29.041 --> 14:31.177
Well...

14:31.178 --> 14:32.981
I'd... something must have
happened between them.

14:32.982 --> 14:34.050
Yes!

14:34.051 --> 14:36.187
Yes, something happened,

14:36.188 --> 14:38.693
and you have no idea what it is,

14:38.694 --> 14:43.369
and I find that... I find that
so un-fucking-believable.

14:45.875 --> 14:48.881
Okay, w-what... what was it?

14:54.058 --> 14:56.095
- It's not my place.
- My God.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.798
Fuck you, Nina! Fuck you!

14:57.799 --> 14:59.868
My brother has been in pain,

14:59.869 --> 15:03.509
in pain for years, and
you did not see it.

15:03.510 --> 15:05.480
You know, I certainly didn't come here

15:05.481 --> 15:07.384
to get all this resentment heaped on me.

15:07.385 --> 15:11.025
I'm sorry you're carrying around
so much anger, but I have to go.

15:11.026 --> 15:13.731
Hey, Helen.

15:13.732 --> 15:17.204
Who was driving the car
that killed Scott Lockhart?

15:20.411 --> 15:22.214
As far as I know, Noah was.

15:23.685 --> 15:25.955
And you believe that?

15:25.956 --> 15:27.057
He confessed.

15:27.058 --> 15:30.197
Kind of crazy, though?

15:30.198 --> 15:32.468
No evidence to convict him.

15:32.469 --> 15:35.541
He basically stood up in
that court, and he...

15:35.542 --> 15:38.547
volunteered to go to prison.

15:43.224 --> 15:46.964
Maybe he felt guilty.

15:46.965 --> 15:49.970
Where were you that night?

15:49.971 --> 15:51.574
I was at home asleep.

15:51.575 --> 15:54.580
Thanks for your help. Take care.

16:30.253 --> 16:34.761
Hi. Hello, it's me.

16:34.762 --> 16:37.032
Helen Solloway.

16:37.033 --> 16:39.203
Okay.

16:39.204 --> 16:41.173
Ha ha.

16:41.174 --> 16:43.479
I'm good. Actually, I'm
in your neighborhood,

16:43.480 --> 16:46.818
and I thought maybe I would stop by.

16:46.819 --> 16:48.889
I mean, if it's a bad time
or if it's inconvenient

16:48.890 --> 16:52.730
or you have company...

16:52.731 --> 16:54.801
Okay.

16:54.802 --> 16:57.809
Okay, great. I'll...
I'll see you soon.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.803
Helen the felon.

17:11.804 --> 17:14.442
Is that really you?

17:14.443 --> 17:16.813
Hi, Max.

17:16.814 --> 17:18.950
I can't believe it. So just...
what, you decided to...

17:18.951 --> 17:20.487
I mean, I was in the neighborhood,

17:20.488 --> 17:22.992
and I-I just... I remembered
that you lived here,

17:22.992 --> 17:26.232
so I thought I would just
take a chance, say hi.

17:26.233 --> 17:28.403
I'm glad you did.

17:28.404 --> 17:30.408
Let me take your stuff.

17:32.545 --> 17:33.848
Can I get you glass of wine?

17:33.849 --> 17:36.519
Um... no, I really shouldn't.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.824
I mean, the kids are home,
and it's a school night,

17:38.825 --> 17:41.664
and I-I just was gonna come
by for a minute and say hi.

17:41.665 --> 17:43.366
Yeah, I'm just gonna pour
you a glass of wine.

17:43.367 --> 17:45.371
Okay.

17:49.079 --> 17:50.515
Are you moving?

17:50.516 --> 17:53.086
Tuesday. Not far, Brooklyn Heights.

17:53.087 --> 17:55.358
Brooklyn Heights?

17:55.359 --> 17:57.729
Isn't that a little
suburban for your taste?

17:57.730 --> 17:59.199
What inspired that?

17:59.200 --> 18:00.568
- You ready for this?
- Ready for what?

18:00.569 --> 18:03.207
I'm getting married.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.212
Cheers.

18:12.728 --> 18:14.229
Wow. Holy shit.

18:14.230 --> 18:15.565
I know, I know.

18:17.169 --> 18:18.170
Her name's Danielle.

18:19.173 --> 18:20.374
Met her at the gym.

18:20.375 --> 18:22.513
What is she, your trainer?

18:22.514 --> 18:25.619
Actually, no. She's an editor.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.222
Really? What kind of editor?

18:27.223 --> 18:28.558
<i>Magazines. She works for Vogue.</i>

18:28.559 --> 18:29.560
Wow, fancy.

18:29.561 --> 18:30.929
She's smarter than me,

18:30.930 --> 18:32.900
more successful, much better looking.

18:32.901 --> 18:35.907
I'd say between the two
of us, I'm winning.

18:38.079 --> 18:39.447
Between me and you?

18:39.448 --> 18:42.153
No. No, me and her.

18:42.154 --> 18:44.157
- Me and her?
- Yeah, right.

18:44.158 --> 18:45.928
No, right, I'm sorry.

18:47.965 --> 18:50.335
Big changes.

18:50.336 --> 18:52.006
A lot can happen in three years.

18:52.007 --> 18:55.512
Yep.

18:55.513 --> 18:59.020
I thought of you recently while
we were looking at venues.

18:59.021 --> 19:00.355
Of me?

19:00.356 --> 19:02.159
We checked out Gedney Farms.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.631
Damn. I mean, you're not
gonna get married in...

19:04.632 --> 19:09.241
No, no, no. Danielle decided
on the city... Ace Hotel.

19:09.242 --> 19:11.779
Gedney looked nice, though. You
know, a little faded, but...

19:12.882 --> 19:14.918
What was that, 22 years ago?
Twenty-three?

19:14.919 --> 19:17.557
Twenty-five.

19:17.558 --> 19:21.732
Exactly... yesterday.

19:21.733 --> 19:23.971
Jesus.

19:23.972 --> 19:25.640
Is that possible?

19:25.641 --> 19:26.642
Yep.

19:26.643 --> 19:27.745
Quarter of a century.

19:27.746 --> 19:29.248
Yep.

19:29.249 --> 19:32.788
We're that old?

19:38.968 --> 19:40.437
Is this her?

19:40.438 --> 19:42.608
Yeah, that's her.

19:50.825 --> 19:54.366
I guess I'm not the love
of your life anymore.

19:56.037 --> 19:57.638
What?

20:06.223 --> 20:08.494
Will you kiss me?

20:12.870 --> 20:16.242
- Helen, I can't.
- Why not?

20:16.243 --> 20:18.246
I knew you first.

20:38.155 --> 20:41.395
Fuck, what are we doing?
What are we doing?

21:09.920 --> 21:12.657
Um...

21:12.658 --> 21:15.463
you still with that guy, Vik?

21:15.464 --> 21:17.066
Yeah.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.104
Cool.

21:19.105 --> 21:20.908
Just checking.

21:32.030 --> 21:33.031
Hey.

21:35.204 --> 21:38.008
You okay? What's going on?

21:38.009 --> 21:41.016
Helen, come on, talk to me.

21:48.130 --> 21:50.969
Was Noah fucked up when I met him?

21:52.672 --> 21:55.377
- What, in college?
- Yeah, freshman year.

21:55.378 --> 21:58.383
Um... yeah, he was totally fucked up.

21:58.384 --> 21:59.819
I mean, his mom had just died.

21:59.820 --> 22:03.861
I know, but he didn't... talk about it.

22:03.862 --> 22:07.001
No, no, but you could just sense it.

22:14.350 --> 22:17.622
Do you think Noah was using me?

22:17.623 --> 22:19.961
Using you?

22:19.962 --> 22:23.467
- For what?
- I don't know, money...

22:23.468 --> 22:28.310
access, entry into some
kind of world. I...

22:28.311 --> 22:31.752
Helen, I think he... I
think he loved you.

22:33.388 --> 22:34.757
But, yeah, also, I think...

22:34.758 --> 22:36.326
I mean, he knew who he was marrying.

22:36.327 --> 22:37.496
Well, what? What is that?

22:37.497 --> 22:39.099
- It's bullshit.
- What?

22:39.100 --> 22:40.234
- It's just bullshit.
- What's bullshit?

22:40.235 --> 22:42.105
I don't know... all of a sudden,

22:42.106 --> 22:43.842
everyone's trying to convince
me that I didn't know this man,

22:43.843 --> 22:46.079
my husband, the father of my children.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.618
- Hey, hey, you brought it up.
- I spent 25 years with him.

22:48.619 --> 22:50.589
Just because things went wrong and...

22:50.590 --> 22:52.393
doesn't mean the whole
story has to change.

22:52.394 --> 22:55.132
I did know him. I knew him
better than anyone did,

22:55.133 --> 22:57.870
probably better than
anyone ever will know him.

22:57.871 --> 22:59.206
All right, you know what?

22:59.207 --> 23:00.642
- What?
- You're right, it is.

23:00.643 --> 23:02.379
- This is bullshit.
- What are you doing?

23:02.380 --> 23:04.717
I have...

23:04.718 --> 23:07.156
um...

23:07.157 --> 23:08.526
I made a terrible mistake.

23:09.996 --> 23:12.000
You need to go.

23:14.872 --> 23:16.207
Fine.

23:16.208 --> 23:18.211
I cannot believe I fell
for this shit again.

23:18.212 --> 23:19.915
I mean, I thought maybe...

23:19.916 --> 23:23.556
maybe this time it was about
us, but it's never about us,

23:23.557 --> 23:25.360
because it's always about him.

23:25.361 --> 23:26.929
- You know what? Can I just...
- What?

23:26.930 --> 23:28.399
I just want to... can I
just ask you one question?

23:28.400 --> 23:29.768
What is it?

23:29.769 --> 23:31.573
Did Noah ever cheat on me in college?

23:33.076 --> 23:36.248
Please get the fuck out of here.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.252
Please go.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.909
Hi.

24:22.910 --> 24:24.245
Hey.

24:24.246 --> 24:26.650
You're so late. Everybody's in bed.

24:26.651 --> 24:28.019
What are you reading?

24:30.459 --> 24:31.994
Your dad's book.

24:31.995 --> 24:33.965
Why?

24:33.966 --> 24:35.969
I want to get to know him better.

24:35.970 --> 24:38.341
Why would you want to do that?

24:38.342 --> 24:41.313
I thought we were trying
to establish a rapport.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.016
Isn't that why we had dinner with them?

24:43.017 --> 24:45.555
That's the last thing I want to do.

24:45.556 --> 24:47.192
Okay.

24:47.193 --> 24:49.696
Hey, where were you? You're
never home this late.

24:49.697 --> 24:52.336
I was showing an apartment.
It took forever.

24:53.907 --> 24:56.577
People don't know what they want.

24:56.578 --> 24:59.483
Well... it's nice to see you.

24:59.484 --> 25:01.888
Hey, what time did Martin get home?

25:01.889 --> 25:04.494
Martin? He's not home yet.

25:04.495 --> 25:06.798
He's not home yet?

25:06.799 --> 25:08.502
I thought maybe he was with you.

25:08.503 --> 25:10.539
Well, did you think to check, Vik?

25:10.540 --> 25:12.977
He's 19 years old, Helen.
I'm sure he's fine.

25:12.978 --> 25:14.514
- Did you call him?
- No.

25:14.515 --> 25:16.885
All right, I'm going upstairs.

25:16.886 --> 25:19.057
Can't I even get a kiss?

25:19.058 --> 25:21.662
I need to call my son.

25:25.036 --> 25:26.571
Is he back yet?

25:26.572 --> 25:28.542
No.

25:28.543 --> 25:30.546
Fuck it, I'm calling the police.

25:30.547 --> 25:31.983
- Hey, Helen.
- Vik!

25:31.984 --> 25:33.518
You need to calm down.

25:33.519 --> 25:35.055
Now, Martin will be home any minute.

25:35.056 --> 25:37.493
Nothing is wrong. Don't
be like your mom.

25:37.494 --> 25:40.399
My mom? What do you know about my mom?

25:40.400 --> 25:42.738
Just that she tends to overreact.

25:42.739 --> 25:44.273
- Isn't that what you told me?
- You know what?

25:44.274 --> 25:46.579
You don't know anything
about me or my family, Vik.

25:46.580 --> 25:48.716
How long have you been in my life?
What, two years?

25:48.717 --> 25:50.085
Well, four, but who's counting?

25:50.086 --> 25:52.224
You don't know anything
about my parents,

25:52.225 --> 25:54.395
and you barely know my kids,
and sometimes I feel like

25:54.396 --> 25:56.198
you're just a stranger
living in my house!

25:56.199 --> 25:58.369
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:58.370 --> 26:00.607
I don't know your kids?

26:00.608 --> 26:02.644
I'm not here with them every day?

26:02.645 --> 26:04.081
You know, running lines with Trevor,

26:04.082 --> 26:05.550
helping Martin with his chem,

26:05.551 --> 26:09.224
picking Stacey up from
fucking art class?

26:09.225 --> 26:12.364
Tell me, Helen.

26:12.365 --> 26:14.501
Tell me, how have I failed you?

26:16.541 --> 26:18.677
Martin. Martin!

26:18.678 --> 26:20.180
Where have you been?

26:20.181 --> 26:21.783
Hey, we were worried about you, buddy.

26:21.784 --> 26:23.052
You should've called.

26:23.053 --> 26:27.195
Fuck off. You're not my dad.

26:27.196 --> 26:30.202
He's right. You're not.

26:32.706 --> 26:34.943
I'm going out.

26:34.944 --> 26:36.949
I need a drink.

26:42.794 --> 26:44.898
Come in.

26:59.828 --> 27:02.766
Where were you?

27:02.767 --> 27:05.373
I was with Dad.

27:07.977 --> 27:10.782
What?

27:10.783 --> 27:12.053
Where?

27:14.291 --> 27:15.893
At the lake house.

27:15.894 --> 27:18.064
At Grandpa's house in...
in Pennsylvania?

27:18.065 --> 27:19.300
Look, Ma, I'm really tired.

27:19.301 --> 27:20.903
Let's just talk about this tomorrow.

27:20.904 --> 27:23.308
No, no. I'm... I don't understand.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.011
So you...

27:25.012 --> 27:27.650
Um...

27:27.651 --> 27:29.487
you managed to get
yourself to Pennsylvania

27:29.488 --> 27:30.857
and Dad was there?

27:30.858 --> 27:32.660
Yes, that's what I said.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.102
What was he doing there?

27:37.103 --> 27:39.641
I can't tell you.

27:39.642 --> 27:41.812
It's between me and him.

27:43.950 --> 27:45.620
Look, I'm going to bed.

27:45.621 --> 27:47.357
I'll go to school tomorrow, I promise.

28:14.713 --> 28:17.952
Hi, Trish. I'm not,
feeling so well today,

28:17.953 --> 28:21.893
so I don't think I'm gonna be
able to make the open house.

28:21.894 --> 28:24.498
Um, if you need me, call my cell.

29:05.917 --> 29:07.921
Noah?

29:09.557 --> 29:12.328
Noah? Noah?

29:25.255 --> 29:27.359
Noah!

29:27.360 --> 29:29.964
Martin, stop! Don't!

29:37.447 --> 29:38.582
Stop!

29:38.583 --> 29:40.819
Noah?

29:40.820 --> 29:43.960
Stop! Martin! Stop!

29:43.961 --> 29:45.562
Stop!

29:45.563 --> 29:48.401
Noah! Noah!

30:00.326 --> 30:03.432
Down here. Thanks.

30:03.433 --> 30:05.202
No.

30:21.203 --> 30:22.838
I'll pay for it,

30:22.839 --> 30:25.643
whatever the insurance doesn't cover.

30:25.644 --> 30:27.481
Really? With what?

30:29.587 --> 30:31.222
The car belongs to the university.

30:31.223 --> 30:34.161
You'll have to work it out with them.

30:37.068 --> 30:38.537
I did love that car.

30:38.538 --> 30:41.075
I'm so sorry.

30:41.076 --> 30:43.080
I'm just happy you're all right.

30:45.218 --> 30:47.355
The police came here again, you know.

30:47.356 --> 30:49.726
- They did?
- Yes.

30:49.727 --> 30:51.896
They're very curious about
why I happened to be there

30:51.897 --> 30:53.200
just after you were stabbed.

30:53.201 --> 30:55.205
Fuck.

30:57.242 --> 31:00.248
I'm sorry. I...

31:02.654 --> 31:04.724
So you're wishing you never
met me right now, right?

31:08.866 --> 31:10.234
It's late.

31:10.235 --> 31:11.837
Where are you going to stay tonight?

31:11.838 --> 31:13.841
I-I don't know.

31:13.842 --> 31:15.210
You can't go back to your apartment.

31:15.211 --> 31:17.015
It's a crime scene.

31:24.029 --> 31:26.701
Have you spoken to the detectives?

31:26.702 --> 31:27.970
Yeah, this morning.

31:27.971 --> 31:29.540
Do they have any other leads

31:29.541 --> 31:31.544
besides me?

31:31.545 --> 31:33.548
Not that I know of.

31:33.549 --> 31:35.553
Brilliant.

31:37.256 --> 31:39.226
You're not worried, are you?

31:39.227 --> 31:40.896
About me? No.

31:40.897 --> 31:43.334
I'm a little worried about you,

31:43.335 --> 31:47.142
but I promised myself I wouldn't
ask you any questions, so...

31:47.143 --> 31:48.846
Why not?

31:48.847 --> 31:50.649
Because...

31:50.650 --> 31:53.589
this is not... a relationship.

31:53.590 --> 31:55.794
This is...

31:57.798 --> 31:59.701
<i>Une aventure.</i>

31:59.702 --> 32:02.641
You don't owe me information.
I don't owe you information.

32:05.714 --> 32:08.452
This bed it terrible.

32:08.453 --> 32:11.124
It's fine.

32:11.125 --> 32:12.461
It's fine.

32:15.434 --> 32:19.575
Well, you're welcome to sleep with me.

32:19.576 --> 32:23.081
Can I ask you a question?

32:23.082 --> 32:25.253
- Yes.
- You're married, right?

32:26.957 --> 32:29.695
Yes.

32:29.696 --> 32:32.033
So you have...

32:32.034 --> 32:35.507
some kind of arrangement
with your husband

32:35.508 --> 32:37.312
when you're away?

32:41.653 --> 32:45.828
My husband suffers from Alzheimer's.

32:45.829 --> 32:47.799
Sorry.

32:47.800 --> 32:51.139
So am I.

32:56.551 --> 33:00.323
But we don't have an
arrangement, as you say.

33:00.324 --> 33:03.598
Half the time he doesn't
even remember he has a wife.

33:05.435 --> 33:08.172
Or he thinks I'm his first wife...

33:08.173 --> 33:10.612
whom he loved better.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.391
Sorry you asked?

33:18.628 --> 33:20.632
A little.

33:32.189 --> 33:34.860
Before I forget, you left these here

33:34.861 --> 33:37.734
when you took off last time.

34:10.233 --> 34:13.005
I want you to tie me up.

34:15.777 --> 34:18.181
What?

34:18.181 --> 34:22.257
You wrote about it in your book.

34:22.257 --> 34:24.428
I've never done anything like that.

34:24.429 --> 34:26.399
I think I'd enjoy it.

34:55.358 --> 34:57.595
Juliette, I'm... I'm...

34:57.596 --> 35:02.138
I'm sorry. I...

35:02.139 --> 35:04.142
Maybe I should get some rest.

35:04.143 --> 35:05.978
<i>Merde. I really picked</i>

35:05.979 --> 35:09.119
<i>the wrong man to have an
aventure with, didn't I?</i>

35:10.488 --> 35:12.324
If you leave early, don't wake me.

40:19.247 --> 40:20.916
Help you?

40:20.917 --> 40:23.622
No, I'm fine.

40:23.623 --> 40:25.927
Holy shit, Solloway.

40:27.631 --> 40:29.267
Jesus, Grant. Is it you?

40:29.268 --> 40:30.536
- Yeah, it's me.
- Wow.

40:30.537 --> 40:32.773
What are you doing in the boonies?

40:32.774 --> 40:35.646
You're here to
sell your dad's house.

40:35.647 --> 40:37.984
That's gonna be tough.
You know, it's hard.

40:37.985 --> 40:39.620
Nobody wants to buy around here now.

40:39.621 --> 40:41.524
We've been trying to sell our
place for, like, a year.

40:41.525 --> 40:43.996
Um, condolences, by the way.

40:43.997 --> 40:46.668
Yeah, thanks.

40:46.669 --> 40:49.373
I saw Nina a couple
times when he was sick.

40:49.374 --> 40:51.010
Really?

40:51.011 --> 40:52.313
She looks good.

40:52.314 --> 40:54.585
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Nina's doing great.

40:56.556 --> 40:58.392
What's it been? It's, like, 20 years...

40:58.393 --> 41:00.162
- Whoa.
- Since I saw you.

41:00.163 --> 41:01.398
More like 30.

41:01.399 --> 41:04.170
Shit. You look exactly the same.

41:04.171 --> 41:05.807
Don't know about that.

41:05.808 --> 41:07.777
How are you, man? You... you okay?

41:07.778 --> 41:09.281
You're working here, yeah?

41:09.282 --> 41:11.285
Yeah. I mean, you know, it's temporary.

41:11.286 --> 41:12.787
You know, it's... the coal plant closed.

41:12.788 --> 41:14.725
I got kids, so...

41:14.726 --> 41:16.061
How old are your kids?

41:16.062 --> 41:17.899
Lila's 17. Nate's 11.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.501
You got kids, right?

41:19.502 --> 41:21.740
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I do.

41:21.741 --> 41:24.144
I-I don't... I don't
see 'em so much, so...

41:24.145 --> 41:25.748
Yeah, I heard...

41:25.749 --> 41:28.219
you know, that you did some time.

41:28.220 --> 41:30.223
How do you know? Did Nina tell you that?

41:30.224 --> 41:32.093
No, it was in the paper.

41:32.094 --> 41:33.830
You're kind of famous around here.

41:33.831 --> 41:35.333
I mean, not everybody from
this neck of the woods

41:35.334 --> 41:37.705
<i>makes it into The New York Times.</i>

41:37.706 --> 41:39.007
You know, plenty go to jail, though,

41:39.008 --> 41:40.344
so, you know, you're sticking

41:40.345 --> 41:41.745
close to your roots in that regard.

41:43.351 --> 41:44.953
Well, I better pay for these.

41:44.954 --> 41:48.527
Yeah. So you
out here by yourself?

41:48.528 --> 41:50.764
- Yeah, I am, yeah.
- You should come for dinner.

41:50.765 --> 41:52.368
No. It's okay.

41:52.369 --> 41:54.205
Come. Meet the kids.

41:54.206 --> 41:56.811
Come around to that other one,

41:56.812 --> 41:58.647
over here.

42:00.251 --> 42:02.088
Lucy'd love to see you.

42:02.089 --> 42:04.192
I-I married Lucy Corry.

42:04.193 --> 42:06.062
I know, she wouldn't even
look at me back then, right?

42:06.063 --> 42:07.899
She came around.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.872
We're on Lake Road, just...

42:10.873 --> 42:13.210
You could walk there from your dad's.

42:13.211 --> 42:15.048
That'd be nice. Thanks.

42:46.111 --> 42:47.279
- Fuck you!
- What the fuck?

42:47.280 --> 42:48.982
Jeez!

42:48.983 --> 42:50.319
Dad?

42:50.320 --> 42:51.922
Martin, what...

42:54.929 --> 42:57.266
What are you doing?

42:57.267 --> 42:59.036
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

42:59.037 --> 43:00.773
Well, aren't you?

43:00.774 --> 43:03.112
Yeah. I was at school...

43:03.113 --> 43:04.547
for the meeting with the headmaster.

43:04.548 --> 43:05.816
Shit.

43:05.817 --> 43:07.453
Where the hell were you?

43:07.454 --> 43:08.489
- I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, yeah.

43:08.490 --> 43:10.626
I'm sorry.

43:13.834 --> 43:16.773
You fucking hate this place!
Why are you here?

43:16.774 --> 43:19.110
Your grandfather left it to me.

43:19.111 --> 43:21.449
To you? Not to Nina?

43:21.450 --> 43:24.020
To me.

43:24.021 --> 43:25.857
I came here to be alone.

43:25.858 --> 43:27.995
Grandpa said that whenever I
wanted to, I could come here.

43:27.996 --> 43:30.099
Now I have to fucking deal with you!

43:30.100 --> 43:31.502
Martin.

43:31.503 --> 43:33.140
Martin!

43:35.812 --> 43:37.614
Martin.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.819
I'm sleeping in here tonight.

43:39.820 --> 43:42.357
Okay.

43:42.358 --> 43:44.296
Is there any food in this house?
I'm starving.

43:45.398 --> 43:47.501
No, not... not really.

43:47.502 --> 43:48.838
I'm gonna go to Denny's, then.

43:48.839 --> 43:50.340
No, listen, I...

43:50.341 --> 43:52.812
A friend of mine's invited
me to dinner tonight.

43:52.813 --> 43:55.818
You want to... maybe we go together?

43:55.819 --> 43:57.522
A friend?

43:57.523 --> 43:59.225
Yeah, he's an old neighbor. I
ran into him in town, and...

43:59.226 --> 44:00.829
And he still talks to you?

44:02.833 --> 44:05.772
Okay, fine, I just... It's just an idea.

44:11.184 --> 44:13.187
What are you doing?

44:13.188 --> 44:15.191
Clearing this place out.

44:15.192 --> 44:16.460
You getting rid of everything?

44:16.461 --> 44:18.030
Most of it.

44:18.031 --> 44:21.069
Look, you see anything
you want, it's yours.

44:21.070 --> 44:24.043
I don't want any of this.

44:37.771 --> 44:39.775
How about this?

44:41.244 --> 44:42.579
What is it?

44:42.580 --> 44:44.951
Open it. It's his...

44:44.952 --> 44:47.523
medals from Korea.

44:47.524 --> 44:49.760
I actually think he'd have
wanted you to have it.

44:56.241 --> 44:57.242
What was that?

45:03.422 --> 45:06.361
It's nothing. It's
just some old letters.

45:17.250 --> 45:19.421
I hate school.

45:23.630 --> 45:25.768
What did you say?

45:27.772 --> 45:29.775
I said I hate school.

45:35.989 --> 45:37.391
I want to join the Army.

45:41.734 --> 45:44.404
Why would you want to do that?

45:44.405 --> 45:46.609
'Cause I want to be like Grandpa.

45:59.636 --> 46:00.971
Dad, are you okay?

46:00.972 --> 46:02.442
Yeah, I'm fine.

46:18.074 --> 46:20.177
- Hey! Welcome. Welcome.
- Hey, Grant.

46:20.178 --> 46:22.181
- Who's this?
- This is my son Martin.

46:22.182 --> 46:24.118
Your son? I thought you said
you were here by yourself?

46:24.119 --> 46:25.488
Yeah, we kind of ran into each other.

46:25.489 --> 46:27.191
- Hi.
- That's great.

46:27.192 --> 46:30.298
Nice to meet you, Martin.
Come on in, meet my family.

46:30.299 --> 46:31.700
Thanks.

46:31.701 --> 46:33.371
- Lucy?
- Yeah?

46:33.372 --> 46:35.875
Noah's here. He brought
his kid with him.

46:35.876 --> 46:38.347
Hey. Noah, remember me?

46:38.348 --> 46:39.349
Lucy Corry, of course.

46:39.350 --> 46:41.120
Yeah, well, Lucy Finley now.

46:41.121 --> 46:43.191
- Hi.
- Hi.

46:43.192 --> 46:45.128
Hi. How old are you?

46:45.129 --> 46:46.230
Nineteen.

46:46.231 --> 46:47.833
Lila's 17, our daughter.

46:47.834 --> 46:49.570
Lila, come on down, meet our guests.

46:49.571 --> 46:51.507
Yeah, we have a son, too.
I don't know where he is.

46:51.508 --> 46:52.576
You want something to drink?

46:52.577 --> 46:54.413
You want soda? We have Coke.

46:54.414 --> 46:56.083
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

46:56.084 --> 46:57.319
Honey, will you get that? I'm
gonna check on the roast.

46:57.320 --> 46:58.321
- Yeah.
- Lila, get down here!

46:58.322 --> 46:59.724
Hey, you want a beer?

46:59.725 --> 47:01.428
No, I shouldn't drink.
I'm on medication.

47:01.429 --> 47:02.897
Just like high school.

47:02.898 --> 47:04.634
Your dad was such a loser.
He never drank.

47:04.635 --> 47:06.938
He never went to parties. He
was afraid to talk to girls.

47:06.939 --> 47:08.140
- Lila.
- Hey.

47:08.141 --> 47:09.677
Meet my old buddy Noah.

47:09.678 --> 47:10.946
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:10.947 --> 47:11.948
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

47:11.949 --> 47:13.017
This is his son Martin.

47:13.018 --> 47:15.155
Hey.

47:15.156 --> 47:16.692
Hi.

47:20.734 --> 47:22.803
Your kid's so much like you were.

47:22.804 --> 47:24.073
I can't get over it.

47:24.074 --> 47:25.175
You think so?

47:25.176 --> 47:27.013
Yeah.

47:27.014 --> 47:29.083
I can't really tell.

47:29.084 --> 47:31.522
We kind of drifted apart.

47:32.992 --> 47:36.231
Solloway! Holy Christ.

47:36.232 --> 47:40.373
Long time no see.

47:40.374 --> 47:42.577
You don't remember me.

47:42.578 --> 47:44.047
Stevie Johnson.

47:44.048 --> 47:45.750
Stevie, yeah. How are you, man?

47:46.753 --> 47:47.954
Good to see you.

47:47.955 --> 47:49.124
I told Stevie you were in town.

47:49.125 --> 47:50.460
He invited himself over for dinner.

47:50.461 --> 47:52.564
Wasn't gonna miss this.

47:52.565 --> 47:56.038
What's it been, 25 years, 30?

47:56.039 --> 47:57.040
Yeah.

47:57.041 --> 47:59.378
You disappeared, brother.

47:59.379 --> 48:01.415
- But I read your book.
- You did?

48:01.416 --> 48:02.919
We all did.

48:02.920 --> 48:04.856
You're filthy.

48:04.857 --> 48:06.359
Where'd that chick come from?

48:06.360 --> 48:08.329
<i>It was like Fifty Shades
of Fucking Solloway.</i>

48:12.338 --> 48:14.241
This is delicious.

48:14.242 --> 48:16.546
Thanks, sweetheart.
It's Grant's mom's recipe.

48:16.547 --> 48:18.384
Your mother
always was a good cook.

48:18.385 --> 48:21.690
She was. You were always
eating out of our fridge.

48:21.691 --> 48:25.398
Okay, buddy. You want to see
pictures of your old man?

48:25.399 --> 48:26.400
Sure.

48:26.401 --> 48:28.737
Here he is,

48:28.738 --> 48:30.408
winning All-State, '85.

48:30.409 --> 48:32.412
I think you broke some state records

48:32.413 --> 48:34.749
- in that meet, didn't you?
- I don't remember.

48:34.750 --> 48:37.388
I'm pretty sure you did...

48:37.389 --> 48:40.962
Here we are at the prom.
We were all wasted.

48:40.963 --> 48:42.465
You can't tell in the picture, though.

48:42.466 --> 48:43.835
You can absolutely tell.

48:43.836 --> 48:45.137
Which prom was that?

48:45.138 --> 48:46.607
Junior, I think.

48:46.608 --> 48:50.347
That makes sense.

48:50.348 --> 48:52.453
Before, all Solloway cared about was

48:52.454 --> 48:55.257
getting into his rich-kid college.

48:55.258 --> 48:57.161
Stevie, college is important.

48:57.162 --> 48:58.965
Lila's going to college, right?

48:58.966 --> 49:00.100
If I get in.

49:00.101 --> 49:02.004
You'll get in.

49:02.005 --> 49:05.579
I don't know how we'll pay
for it, but you'll get in.

49:05.580 --> 49:10.222
So, Solloway, what exactly
happened to your neck?

49:10.223 --> 49:13.127
I... I had a mole removed.

49:17.437 --> 49:20.108
How about you? You... you got burned?

49:20.109 --> 49:22.279
Explosion at the plant.

49:22.280 --> 49:24.183
That's terrible.

49:24.184 --> 49:26.588
- I don't need your pity.
- I wasn't...

49:26.589 --> 49:28.292
At least I didn't get locked up.

49:30.096 --> 49:32.767
I just can't see
it, you in the slammer.

49:32.768 --> 49:34.771
It's hilarious.

49:34.772 --> 49:36.173
All right, Stevie, lay off.

49:36.174 --> 49:37.443
You should've seen your dad

49:37.444 --> 49:39.180
at the end of high school, kid,

49:39.181 --> 49:41.485
studying like he was gonna be
the next Albert Einstein...

49:41.486 --> 49:43.722
barely left his house senior year

49:43.723 --> 49:45.393
except to go to school.

49:45.394 --> 49:46.728
All right, you know what?
His mom was sick, Stevie.

49:46.729 --> 49:50.002
Come on, that had
nothing to do with it.

49:50.003 --> 49:53.208
Truth is Solloway always
thought he was better.

49:53.209 --> 49:56.849
But, well, look how it all turned out.

49:56.850 --> 49:59.155
Turns out he's trash just
like the rest of us.

50:01.192 --> 50:04.565
Well, isn't this a real
nice evening we're having?

50:04.566 --> 50:05.966
Why don't you give him some credit?

50:08.273 --> 50:12.848
You know, most people... they
never get out of this town.

50:12.849 --> 50:15.086
Your dad really did.

50:15.087 --> 50:17.191
He did good.

50:17.192 --> 50:19.195
Mom, I'm finished. Can I go?

50:19.196 --> 50:20.530
Go where?

50:20.531 --> 50:21.599
To Amber's, she's having a party.

50:21.600 --> 50:22.768
I told her she could go.

50:22.769 --> 50:24.205
Are you done with all your homework?

50:24.206 --> 50:25.943
Yes, Dad.

50:30.151 --> 50:32.555
Do you want to come?

50:35.395 --> 50:37.632
You should go, Martin.
Go on, it'll be fun.

50:37.633 --> 50:39.235
No, that's okay.

50:39.236 --> 50:42.307
No, come on, kid. Don't be
a loser like your old man.

50:42.308 --> 50:45.180
I'm done, too. Can I be excused?

50:45.181 --> 50:46.249
Sure, sweetheart.

50:46.250 --> 50:47.519
Thank you for dinner.

50:47.520 --> 50:49.524
Anytime.

50:51.461 --> 50:53.664
Jesus, Stevie!

50:53.665 --> 50:56.336
Why do you always have
to be such a dick?

51:08.796 --> 51:11.500
Either of you remember
a-a guy named Gunther?

51:11.501 --> 51:14.072
John Gunther?

51:14.073 --> 51:17.913
I think he lived in, um, Bloomsburg,

51:17.914 --> 51:19.450
went to East Side.

51:19.451 --> 51:22.188
Yeah, his folks own that
hunting store off 76.

51:22.189 --> 51:24.994
Yeah, yeah, Gunther's,
Hunting and Shooting.

51:24.995 --> 51:26.431
I passed it on the way in.

51:26.432 --> 51:27.800
What about him?

51:27.801 --> 51:31.808
What was he like? Do you remember?

51:31.809 --> 51:33.612
We didn't know him personally, Solloway.

51:33.613 --> 51:35.315
Not if he went to East Side.

51:37.989 --> 51:39.690
Here you go.

51:42.030 --> 51:43.532
You okay, Noah?

51:47.842 --> 51:50.212
You don't look so good.

52:25.217 --> 52:29.659
Motherfuck!!

52:29.660 --> 52:34.370
Fucking...

52:44.757 --> 52:48.063
Dad? Dad!

52:48.064 --> 52:49.399
Dad, wake up.

52:49.400 --> 52:51.703
Dad!

52:51.704 --> 52:53.608
Dad, get up, come on.

52:54.945 --> 52:57.381
Stop. Stop.

53:00.455 --> 53:03.594
God.

53:03.595 --> 53:05.030
Hey...

53:05.031 --> 53:08.003
Hey.

53:08.004 --> 53:09.272
How was the party?

53:09.273 --> 53:10.274
It was fun.

53:10.275 --> 53:12.244
Yeah. Hey, help me up.

53:16.388 --> 53:18.392
- Here.
- Thanks.

53:23.035 --> 53:25.238
That's good.

53:25.239 --> 53:27.610
That's great.

53:35.626 --> 53:37.797
- Let me help you.
- That's okay.

53:37.798 --> 53:40.001
Let me do it, come on.

53:40.002 --> 53:42.006
- Give it to me.
- Yeah.

53:45.146 --> 53:47.650
Dad.

53:47.651 --> 53:50.021
What the fuck is wrong with you?

53:50.022 --> 53:52.928
Why are you such a fucking mess?

54:26.129 --> 54:28.266
Can I come in?

54:28.267 --> 54:30.271
Fuck off.

54:46.136 --> 54:47.004
What is it?

54:47.005 --> 54:49.009
Read it.

55:03.438 --> 55:06.610
What is it?

55:06.611 --> 55:09.617
It's the note your grandmother
left the night she died.

55:13.358 --> 55:16.530
What, like a suicide note?

55:16.531 --> 55:18.500
This looks like your handwriting.

55:18.501 --> 55:20.004
It is.

55:20.005 --> 55:22.142
Why?

55:25.048 --> 55:28.220
Because...

55:28.221 --> 55:30.926
because I-I wrote it for her.

55:30.927 --> 55:34.400
She was too sick to hold the pen, so...

55:34.401 --> 55:35.770
I had to.

55:38.943 --> 55:41.914
I...

55:41.915 --> 55:46.457
I helped her die, Martin.

55:46.458 --> 55:48.762
She was in so much pain,
she just wanted a way out,

55:48.763 --> 55:52.136
and...

55:52.137 --> 55:54.141
and I helped her.

55:57.447 --> 56:00.218
Why are you telling me this?

56:00.219 --> 56:02.057
I just...

56:04.829 --> 56:07.199
Your grandfather and I, we...
we... we didn't really talk

56:07.200 --> 56:09.004
about anything.

56:11.409 --> 56:14.180
And I know I've let you down.

56:14.181 --> 56:17.588
I know I've let you down... severely.

56:19.759 --> 56:22.765
And you may never be able to forgive me.

56:25.637 --> 56:30.113
But I love you...

56:30.114 --> 56:32.450
more than you can possibly imagine.

56:36.626 --> 56:39.264
You won't really know
till you have your own.

56:42.004 --> 56:44.675
I just... I just wanted you to
understand a little about me

56:44.676 --> 56:46.078
so that...

56:49.085 --> 56:51.356
One day when I die and you're
clearing out my house,

56:51.357 --> 56:54.862
you won't be rehearsing
conversations that...

56:57.436 --> 56:59.672
You know you'll never have.

57:16.106 --> 57:18.929
You got to go to school
tomorrow morning.

57:19.830 --> 57:22.336
Please?

57:22.337 --> 57:24.572
Please go, for your mother.

57:27.042 --> 57:29.476
Just let her see you graduate,
and then after that,

57:29.477 --> 57:34.315
you can do whatever the fuck
you want with your life.

57:34.316 --> 57:35.817
Okay?

57:38.320 --> 57:39.587
Yeah, okay.

58:27.302 --> 58:29.204
Martin, get up.

59:17.619 --> 59:19.386
Martin?

59:19.387 --> 59:22.690
Martin! Stop!

59:24.059 --> 59:27.328
Martin, stop! Stop!

59:30.398 --> 59:32.533
Martin!
