WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:04.045
In order to break free

00:02.085 --> 00:04.045
of the earth's atmosphere,

00:04.087 --> 00:05.255
a rocket ship must attain speeds

00:05.297 --> 00:07.716
of upwards

00:05.297 --> 00:07.716
of 25,000 miles per hour.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.217
Bull. If they

00:07.758 --> 00:09.217
went that fast,

00:09.259 --> 00:11.428
they would just be squashed

00:09.259 --> 00:11.428
in the back of their seats.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.054
They wouldn't float around.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.056
You're confusing acceleration

00:13.096 --> 00:15.056
with velocity.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.100
You feel it when you first

00:15.098 --> 00:17.100
start going faster,

00:17.142 --> 00:19.687
but once you're up to speed,

00:17.142 --> 00:19.687
you don't even notice.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.146
I mean, right now

00:19.728 --> 00:21.146
we're on a planet

00:21.188 --> 00:23.315
that's spinning

00:21.188 --> 00:23.315
at a thousand miles per hour,

00:23.357 --> 00:25.150
and that's just

00:23.357 --> 00:25.150
rotational velocity.

00:25.192 --> 00:28.069
We're also traveling around

00:25.192 --> 00:28.069
the sun at almost 67,000

00:28.111 --> 00:29.446
miles per hour,

00:28.111 --> 00:29.446
and then

00:29.488 --> 00:31.866
the whole solar system is

00:29.488 --> 00:31.866
hurtling through the galaxy,

00:31.907 --> 00:34.075
which is hurtling away

00:31.907 --> 00:34.075
from all the other galaxies

00:34.117 --> 00:35.410
because the universe

00:34.117 --> 00:35.410
is expanding.

hear that?

01:20.163 --> 01:21.498
Firing

01:20.163 --> 01:21.498
retro-jets, Captain.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.124
Hal, I think

01:21.540 --> 01:23.124
somebody's trying

01:23.166 --> 01:24.543
to break into

01:23.166 --> 01:24.543
our house.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.003
I'll do it

01:24.585 --> 01:26.003
in the morning.

01:26.045 --> 01:27.128
(scraping)

01:27.170 --> 01:28.380
What was that?

01:31.174 --> 01:32.843
Oh, my God!

01:31.174 --> 01:32.843
Hal!

01:32.885 --> 01:34.177
I'll get 'em, Lois.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.685
(clang)

01:39.600 --> 01:41.685
REESE: Got him!

01:44.271 --> 01:46.356
(thrashing)

01:46.398 --> 01:51.403
(panting)

01:53.196 --> 01:54.322
What would

01:53.196 --> 01:54.322
have happened

01:54.364 --> 01:56.075
if Reese didn't

01:54.364 --> 01:56.075
knock him out?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.159
He would have seen

01:56.116 --> 01:58.159
our TV and stereo

01:58.201 --> 02:00.537
and known he'd made

01:58.201 --> 02:00.537
a terrible mistake.

02:00.579 --> 02:01.789
Now let go of my arm.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.164
He came through

02:01.830 --> 02:03.164
the window

02:03.206 --> 02:04.165
right in front of us.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.166
I-I can't explain it.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.168
It was like, it was like

02:05.208 --> 02:07.168
we were paralyzed,

02:07.210 --> 02:08.796
and then my son

02:07.210 --> 02:08.796
Reese came in,

02:08.837 --> 02:10.047
swinging this bat.

02:10.089 --> 02:11.172
He saved us all.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.591
Yeah, it's

02:11.214 --> 02:12.591
a good thing

02:12.633 --> 02:14.551
Reese got to him

02:12.633 --> 02:14.551
before I did.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.177
And where were you, sir?

02:16.219 --> 02:17.387
I was in bed.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.098
Actually, trapped in bed.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.183
You see, my wife insists

02:19.139 --> 02:22.183
on tucking in the corners--

02:22.225 --> 02:24.185
I mean,  really

02:22.225 --> 02:24.185
tucking them in.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.646
I saw his head in the moonlight.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.188
It looked like

02:25.687 --> 02:27.188
a big, fat pitch

02:27.230 --> 02:28.189
sitting over the plate.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.191
If only there were

02:28.231 --> 02:30.191
more kids like you,

02:30.233 --> 02:31.610
our streets would

02:30.233 --> 02:31.610
be a lot safer.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.194
Thanks.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.362
You look familiar.

02:34.404 --> 02:38.199
Did you ever participate

02:34.404 --> 02:38.199
in our ride-along program?

02:38.241 --> 02:41.202
Sort of.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.830
It's like being

02:41.244 --> 02:42.830
in a straitjacket.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.039
You twist and you twist

02:44.081 --> 02:46.374
and you just can't shake

02:44.081 --> 02:46.374
the damn sheets loose.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.210
Well, the most important

02:46.416 --> 02:49.210
thing is, we caught the guy.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.088
You know what?

02:49.252 --> 02:51.088
Why don't I show you?

02:51.130 --> 02:53.214
Follow me to the bedroom and

02:51.130 --> 02:53.214
I'll tuck you in. You'll...

02:53.256 --> 02:56.217
Sir! You don't tuck in

02:53.256 --> 02:56.217
police officers.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.219
Craig! I got your lunch!

02:58.261 --> 02:59.471
Sorry I'm late.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.223
Picked up your burgers and I had

02:59.513 --> 03:02.223
to drive a half an hour

03:02.265 --> 03:05.019
across town to get your chicken

03:02.265 --> 03:05.019
from Nugget World.

03:05.060 --> 03:10.065
I thought you said you wanted

03:05.060 --> 03:10.065
to help me lead a normal life.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.233
Did you get the extra mayo?

03:12.275 --> 03:13.234
Yes.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.236
From which place?

03:15.278 --> 03:17.823
When are you getting the nurse?

03:17.865 --> 03:20.408
Well, gee, Lois, it's just

03:17.865 --> 03:20.408
that I've been so busy

03:20.450 --> 03:23.078
with, you know,

03:20.450 --> 03:23.078
having my arms and legs broken

03:23.120 --> 03:25.122
when your kids' dog

03:23.120 --> 03:25.122
chased me out into traffic.

03:25.164 --> 03:27.499
Plus, I can't sleep

03:25.164 --> 03:27.499
knowing the mental trauma

03:27.541 --> 03:29.543
my cat suffers

03:27.541 --> 03:29.543
staying at Mother's.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.252
Then there's all

03:29.584 --> 03:31.252
the forehead sticks

03:31.294 --> 03:33.172
I went through learning

03:31.294 --> 03:33.172
to go to the bathroom.

03:33.212 --> 03:36.508
Craig, the insurance company

03:33.212 --> 03:36.508
gave you money for a nurse.

03:36.550 --> 03:40.888
Ah, Lois, poor, sweet,

03:36.550 --> 03:40.888
money-wasting Lois.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.263
I've got something better.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.223
Oliver!

03:46.560 --> 03:48.812
Oh, my God, is

03:46.560 --> 03:48.812
that a monkey?

03:49.897 --> 03:51.272
It's a helper monkey.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.858
They're highly trained

03:51.314 --> 03:52.858
and they donate them free

03:52.900 --> 03:54.275
to the permanently disabled.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.986
You're not

03:54.317 --> 03:55.986
permanently disabled.

03:56.028 --> 03:58.279
For the next six weeks,

03:56.028 --> 03:58.279
he thinks I am.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.074
Craig, I am

03:58.321 --> 04:00.074
not taking care

04:00.115 --> 04:01.700
of you and

04:00.115 --> 04:01.700
a wild animal.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.702
Lois, it's not a wild animal.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.286
It's a capuchin monkey.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.122
They're nature's butlers.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.289
I got a good one, too.

04:08.331 --> 04:11.001
His brother worked

04:08.331 --> 04:11.001
for Stephen Hawking.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.839
My God, when was the last time

04:12.335 --> 04:15.839
this thing was cleaned?

04:17.340 --> 04:18.508
(shrieking)

04:19.801 --> 04:21.302
This is the worst

04:19.801 --> 04:21.302
job in the world.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.304
Why do we

04:21.344 --> 04:23.304
put up with this?

04:23.346 --> 04:25.933
I don't know about you, but I'm

04:23.346 --> 04:25.933
still paying off law school.

04:25.974 --> 04:26.934
Okay, everybody!

04:26.975 --> 04:28.936
Clear out. You're all fired.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.353
What?

04:28.977 --> 04:30.353
Camp's closing.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.355
They cut down

04:30.395 --> 04:32.355
the last tree today.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.315
Anyone want to take

04:32.397 --> 04:34.315
a picture with it?

04:34.357 --> 04:35.734
A mining company

04:34.357 --> 04:35.734
bought the land.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.903
You got to be out of

04:35.776 --> 04:37.903
here by the end of today.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.696
We're just out like

04:37.945 --> 04:39.696
that without notice?

04:39.738 --> 04:41.489
This is the circle

04:39.738 --> 04:41.489
of life up here.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.117
First they cut down the trees.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.035
Then the mining company

04:43.158 --> 04:45.035
strips the land.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.495
Then, with any luck at all,

04:45.077 --> 04:47.495
they turn whatever's left

04:47.537 --> 04:49.123
into a nuclear

04:47.537 --> 04:49.123
waste dump.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.125
It's the only way we're

04:49.164 --> 04:51.125
going to wean ourselves

04:51.166 --> 04:53.210
from our unhealthy

04:51.166 --> 04:53.210
dependence on foreign oil.

04:53.252 --> 04:56.255
Well, I guess

04:53.252 --> 04:56.255
I'm going to have to move

04:56.296 --> 04:58.298
back in with my parents.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.135
And then,

04:59.633 --> 05:01.135
after the awards ceremony

05:01.176 --> 05:03.011
they gave me a tour

05:01.176 --> 05:03.011
of the police station.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.345
Did you know

05:03.053 --> 05:04.345
that the mirrors

05:04.387 --> 05:06.014
in the interrogation room

05:04.387 --> 05:06.014
are two-way?

05:06.056 --> 05:08.142
It's a good thing

05:06.056 --> 05:08.142
they didn't have that before.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.351
"For heroism

05:08.183 --> 05:10.351
and meritorious action."

05:10.393 --> 05:12.020
Reese, I'm so proud of you.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.396
Okay, Dewey,

05:12.062 --> 05:13.396
are you finally

05:13.438 --> 05:15.356
going to be able

05:13.438 --> 05:15.356
to go to sleep now?

05:15.398 --> 05:18.235
You saw all the policemen

05:15.398 --> 05:18.235
and how strong the bars are.

05:18.277 --> 05:19.278
Yeah, but...

05:19.319 --> 05:20.528
And you saw

05:19.319 --> 05:20.528
that the police station

05:20.570 --> 05:22.530
is much too big

05:20.570 --> 05:22.530
for a helicopter

05:20.570 --> 05:22.530
to carry it away

05:22.572 --> 05:24.032
to a secret hideout

05:22.572 --> 05:24.032
under the sea.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.366
But...

05:24.074 --> 05:25.366
No buts, Dewey.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.077
That guy is

05:25.408 --> 05:27.077
in a jail cell.

05:27.119 --> 05:28.369
He's not going anywhere.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.454
REESE:

05:28.411 --> 05:29.454
I wouldn't bet on it.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.248
With our legal system

05:31.290 --> 05:32.749
he's probably back

05:31.290 --> 05:32.749
on the streets right now.

05:32.791 --> 05:33.792
(gasps)

05:32.791 --> 05:33.792
Dewey.

05:33.834 --> 05:34.835
Mom, Dad,

05:34.876 --> 05:36.628
this whole thing's

05:34.876 --> 05:36.628
got me thinking.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.963
I mean, usually those cops

05:38.005 --> 05:40.257
are throwing me in the back

05:38.005 --> 05:40.257
of their squad cars,

05:40.299 --> 05:42.217
but today they were all

05:40.299 --> 05:42.217
clapping for me.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.844
Well, you're

05:42.259 --> 05:43.844
a real hero.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.305
And it was really cool,

05:43.885 --> 05:46.305
you know, protecting you guys,

05:46.345 --> 05:48.223
saving your lives.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.432
Thanks again.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.226
And it's made me realize

05:51.268 --> 05:53.187
for the first time in my life,

05:53.228 --> 05:54.896
I know what my purpose is.

05:54.938 --> 05:57.065
I think I've found my calling.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.400
Mom, Dad...

05:59.442 --> 06:00.652
I want to be a pig.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.323
MALCOLM:

06:01.820 --> 06:04.323
Go to sleep.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.200
I'm still scared.

06:06.241 --> 06:09.410
Read me a story.

06:06.241 --> 06:09.410
Please.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.872
I've already read you

06:09.452 --> 06:11.872
every book in this place.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.665
Please.

06:23.758 --> 06:28.305
"Aardvark. A burrowing mammal

06:23.758 --> 06:28.305
of Southern Africa."

06:28.347 --> 06:31.432
"Myocardium. The muscle tissue

06:28.347 --> 06:31.432
of the heart."

06:40.483 --> 06:42.443
(screaming)

06:42.485 --> 06:43.528
It's all right.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.446
It was just me

06:43.570 --> 06:45.446
turning off the light.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.447
Where are you?!

06:46.489 --> 06:49.076
(crashing)

06:49.117 --> 06:50.994
(muttering)

06:57.084 --> 06:59.086
Sorry.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.505
Go back to sleep.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.222
"Commingle."

07:15.560 --> 07:18.730
It turns out it was all

07:15.560 --> 07:18.730
a simple misunderstanding.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.399
(chuckles)

07:22.109 --> 07:24.403
It's Larry who should have

07:22.109 --> 07:24.403
gotten the spin-off show,

07:24.444 --> 07:25.570
not the Ropers, huh, Oliver?

07:25.612 --> 07:26.780
(chuckles)

07:26.821 --> 07:29.074
Oh, Lois, you're not

07:26.821 --> 07:29.074
drinking your tea.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.492
Oliver, Lois takes

07:29.116 --> 07:31.492
sugar in her tea.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.577
One lump.

07:35.538 --> 07:39.334
I usually like to thank him

07:35.538 --> 07:39.334
when he does something right.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.878
Um, thank you, Oliver.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.880
Isn't he amazing?

07:43.922 --> 07:45.673
He makes the bed,

07:43.922 --> 07:45.673
he does dishes.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.968
He even changes his own diaper.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.470
Oliver, temple massage.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.723
Oh...

07:55.350 --> 07:58.686
This is about

07:55.350 --> 07:58.686
as good as it gets.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.563
Lois, you want

07:58.728 --> 08:00.563
some of this?

08:00.605 --> 08:02.065
I have to go.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.487
Oh, you're like

08:04.025 --> 08:07.487
a furry little geisha.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.411
(imitating explosion)

08:14.453 --> 08:16.330
Hey, what's going on here?

08:16.371 --> 08:17.956
We're just playing.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.249
It's getting a little loud.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.542
This is a nice neighborhood.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.171
Let's keep it that way.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.008
Stay in school.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.845
Hey, you kids!

08:29.676 --> 08:31.845
Wear your helmets!

08:31.886 --> 08:33.054
That's not safe!

08:33.096 --> 08:34.431
Who the hell are you?

08:37.892 --> 08:40.728
Ouch! Ow!

08:40.770 --> 08:43.398
See? You should be

08:40.770 --> 08:43.398
more careful.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.526
Play safe. Be smart.

08:47.777 --> 08:48.862
Did you get the job?

08:48.903 --> 08:50.822
No. It was a stupid idea anyway,

08:50.864 --> 08:52.740
auditioning for a cruise ship.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.493
And what kind of a piano player

08:54.534 --> 08:56.577
doesn't know the music

08:54.534 --> 08:56.577
to  Cabaret?

08:56.619 --> 08:58.163
Honey, this is useless.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.956
We have to go someplace

08:58.205 --> 08:59.956
where there's work!

08:59.998 --> 09:01.291
We're not leaving our home.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.501
Something will come up.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.626
(knocking)

09:03.668 --> 09:04.836
We're not here.

09:03.668 --> 09:04.836
What?

09:04.878 --> 09:07.547
Piama! I know

09:04.878 --> 09:07.547
you're in there!

09:09.049 --> 09:10.217
Hey, what's the problem?

09:10.258 --> 09:11.426
Look, I'm sorry.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.011
We served your

09:11.468 --> 09:13.011
eviction notice

09:11.468 --> 09:13.011
30 days ago.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.012
You have to leave.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.472
Eviction? What are

09:14.054 --> 09:15.472
you talking about?

09:15.514 --> 09:16.681
Why didn't you tell me?

09:16.723 --> 09:18.517
Because it's not happening.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.061
Hey, the tribal council made

09:18.558 --> 09:21.061
a deal with the mining company.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.479
You're getting a settlement.

09:22.521 --> 09:23.604
Part of a settlement.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.400
Only one-fifteenth of your

09:23.646 --> 09:26.400
property's on tribal land.

09:26.441 --> 09:27.984
Forget it!

09:28.026 --> 09:29.652
We'll just live in

09:28.026 --> 09:29.652
the other part of the house.

09:29.694 --> 09:30.695
You can't do that.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.280
This whole area's been

09:30.737 --> 09:32.280
designated

09:32.322 --> 09:33.656
as an arsenic containment basin.

09:33.698 --> 09:36.034
Nobody's stealing

09:33.698 --> 09:36.034
my property.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.119
Let's just all cool down.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.205
Uh, you may actually

09:38.161 --> 09:40.205
not want to touch her.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.623
Don't tell me how to do my job.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.833
All right, missy,

09:43.875 --> 09:45.877
let's get one

09:43.875 --> 09:45.877
thing straight.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.364
(ATM beeping)

10:14.406 --> 10:15.949
What time is it?

10:15.990 --> 10:17.658
Oh, damn!

10:17.700 --> 10:20.287
It's too dark

10:17.700 --> 10:20.287
to see my Rolex.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.662
No matter.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.665
I'll just take out

10:21.704 --> 10:24.665
the maximum amount,

10:24.707 --> 10:26.751
and everything

10:24.707 --> 10:26.751
will be fine.

10:26.793 --> 10:31.047
Yeah, that ought to do it.

10:31.089 --> 10:34.593
Now, where did

10:31.089 --> 10:34.593
I park my Bentley?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.261
Damn my inability

10:34.634 --> 10:36.261
to see in the dark.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.637
Hey!

10:39.598 --> 10:40.932
Can I help you with something?

10:42.725 --> 10:44.685
Your money's hanging out of

10:42.725 --> 10:44.685
your pocket.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.146
You might want

10:44.727 --> 10:46.146
to tuck it back in.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.397
This is a bad neighborhood.

10:47.439 --> 10:50.775
Thank you.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.528
(metallic clattering)

11:00.368 --> 11:02.703
Ooh, that lasagna smells good.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.080
Took you long

11:02.745 --> 11:04.080
enough, though.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.291
What, did you have to

11:04.122 --> 11:06.291
fly to Italy to get it?

11:06.333 --> 11:07.708
Never mind.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.544
Let's, uh, let's dig in.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.546
Oh! Oh!

11:11.963 --> 11:13.714
Hot, hot, hot.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.674
Let-Let's just let it

11:13.756 --> 11:15.674
cool down a little bit.

11:16.468 --> 11:17.344
(yelping)

11:19.471 --> 11:20.721
(coughing)

11:20.763 --> 11:22.765
Oh! Hot! Tongue!

11:22.807 --> 11:25.143
Blisters!

11:22.807 --> 11:25.143
Please, God, no! Water!

11:26.561 --> 11:28.729
Water. Good monkey.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.731
Closer. Closer.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.195
Aah! Hot!

11:35.236 --> 11:36.988
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

11:50.793 --> 11:52.003
(whispering):

11:50.793 --> 11:52.003
You're out.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.129
I was safe.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.713
Out.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.713
Safe.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.221
Looks like someone

11:59.802 --> 12:01.221
smashed up

12:01.262 --> 12:02.763
your trash cans

12:01.262 --> 12:02.763
pretty good.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.140
Maybe if you brought them in

12:02.805 --> 12:04.140
on time,

12:04.182 --> 12:05.724
this kind of thing

12:04.182 --> 12:05.724
wouldn't happen.

12:08.727 --> 12:09.770
Oliver!

12:09.812 --> 12:12.023
Is my milkshake ready?

12:12.065 --> 12:14.775
It was supposed to be ready

12:12.065 --> 12:14.775
an hour ago!

12:14.817 --> 12:17.487
If it's warm,

12:14.817 --> 12:17.487
you can go ahead and drink it

12:17.529 --> 12:19.656
'cause I won't.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.658
All right, I will.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.993
Where is it?

12:24.035 --> 12:27.080
Oliver?

12:34.128 --> 12:36.506
You know what,

12:34.128 --> 12:36.506
I've changed my mind.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.633
I'm not in the mood

12:36.548 --> 12:38.633
for a milkshake anymore.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.009
(chittering)

12:40.051 --> 12:43.680
Well, since you did go

12:40.051 --> 12:43.680
to all that trouble.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.274
Mmm, good.

13:08.037 --> 13:11.124
Well, I've been awake

13:08.037 --> 13:11.124
for a week straight.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.084
First 96 hours were tough,

13:13.126 --> 13:15.920
but I really think I'm starting

13:13.126 --> 13:15.920
to get my second wind.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.925
Who needs sleep anyway?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.843
Just a waste of time.

13:22.885 --> 13:27.014
They say that Thomas Edison--

13:22.885 --> 13:27.014
he only got, like...

13:27.056 --> 13:28.849
Well, he didn't...

13:28.891 --> 13:32.853
What was I talking about?

13:32.895 --> 13:34.481
Never mind.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.868
Craig, I can't stay long.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.537
I got your mail.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.872
Geez, it's boiling in here.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.793
Really?

13:51.914 --> 13:54.793
I hadn't noticed anything.

13:54.833 --> 13:55.876
I was just

13:55.918 --> 13:57.878
spending a pleasant afternoon

13:55.918 --> 13:57.878
at home

13:57.920 --> 13:59.506
here with Oliver.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.926
Lois, that monkey

14:01.215 --> 14:03.926
is out to get me.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.762
What?

14:03.968 --> 14:05.762
He tried to poison me

14:05.804 --> 14:06.887
and now he's

14:05.804 --> 14:06.887
trying to cook me alive.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.598
He is an evil little monkey.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.767
Craig, you're asking

14:08.640 --> 14:10.767
an animal with a brain the size

14:10.809 --> 14:12.393
of a piece of gum

14:10.809 --> 14:12.393
to run your household.

14:12.435 --> 14:13.520
Stop being paranoid.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.480
I am not being paranoid.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.731
I've seen him staring

14:16.773 --> 14:19.150
at me when I'm pretending

14:16.773 --> 14:19.150
to be asleep.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.611
He's been chewing

14:19.192 --> 14:21.611
on my brake cables.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.904
You have got to get me

14:21.653 --> 14:23.904
out of here.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.199
You are not staying with me.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.116
Craig...

14:27.158 --> 14:28.576
that monkey is not...

14:28.618 --> 14:30.911
(laughing hysterically)

14:30.953 --> 14:34.374
Lois, you tell

14:30.953 --> 14:34.374
such amusing stories. Shh.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.126
You are getting

14:34.415 --> 14:37.126
a real nurse tomorrow.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.092
MAN:

14:43.966 --> 14:45.092
Just a quart of milk?

14:45.134 --> 14:47.178
WOMAN:

14:45.134 --> 14:47.178
That's it.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.646
(tires squeal)

14:56.688 --> 14:58.773
(horn honks)

14:59.691 --> 15:00.859
What are you doing?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.861
I was waiting

15:00.900 --> 15:02.861
for that spot!

15:02.902 --> 15:04.404
Oh, you got a problem

15:02.902 --> 15:04.404
with me, pal?

15:04.445 --> 15:06.406
Oh, bring it on.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.575
Well, you want it? You got it.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.950
I'll kick your ass.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.119
You think I'm afraid of you?

15:12.161 --> 15:13.580
I am not afraid!

15:13.621 --> 15:15.456
No one's tucked in now!

15:15.498 --> 15:16.999
Just give me 30 seconds.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.586
I'll beat you

15:17.041 --> 15:19.586
like I was your daddy.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.882
I am going to pound your head

15:23.923 --> 15:26.050
out through your

15:23.923 --> 15:26.050
butt, and then

15:26.092 --> 15:27.844
I'm going to make you kiss it.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.136
I am very sorry, sir.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.681
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're

15:29.178 --> 15:31.681
going to be sorry.

15:31.723 --> 15:32.973
Hey, hey, where are you going?

15:33.015 --> 15:34.975
What, are you going to run away,

15:33.015 --> 15:34.975
little girl?

15:35.017 --> 15:36.143
Why don't you

15:35.017 --> 15:36.143
come out here

15:36.185 --> 15:37.311
and fight like a man?

15:47.113 --> 15:48.989
Hey, Mom, what

15:47.113 --> 15:48.989
are you doing?

15:49.031 --> 15:50.617
Unloading the groceries.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.828
You're, uh, a little far

15:50.658 --> 15:53.828
on the sidewalk, aren't you?

15:53.870 --> 15:55.037
Who cares? Grab a bag.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.998
You have to leave the sidewalk

15:55.079 --> 15:57.998
free for pedestrians.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.876
Stop stalling and help unload.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.712
Are you walking away from me?

16:02.754 --> 16:04.839
Excuse me?

16:04.881 --> 16:06.215
You can't leave your car here.

16:06.257 --> 16:09.803
I will leave my car wherever

16:06.257 --> 16:09.803
I want to leave my car.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.095
Well, I'd hate to see

16:11.137 --> 16:12.847
anything happen to your car.

16:12.889 --> 16:17.226
Just bring in the bags, Reese.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.271
(bang)

16:20.313 --> 16:24.317
(sirens blaring)

16:24.358 --> 16:26.402
Officer in need of assistance!

16:26.444 --> 16:28.613
Repeat: Officer in need

16:26.444 --> 16:28.613
of assistance!

16:28.655 --> 16:31.491
(snoring)

16:34.368 --> 16:36.287
(soft footsteps)

16:39.081 --> 16:43.169
(snoring fast)

16:47.799 --> 16:50.176
(whimpers)

17:00.144 --> 17:01.103
(groans)

17:01.145 --> 17:02.438
(line rings)

17:02.480 --> 17:04.482
WOMAN (on phone):

17:02.480 --> 17:04.482
911 emergency.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.776
(whispering):

17:04.524 --> 17:06.776
This is Craig Feldspar.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.068
You've got to help me.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.321
My monkey butler

17:08.110 --> 17:10.321
is trying to kill me.

17:10.363 --> 17:14.033
I don't know how much time

17:10.363 --> 17:14.033
I have...

17:17.119 --> 17:19.079
That lawyer was a total idiot.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.122
Are you kidding?

17:20.164 --> 17:22.082
A $50 fine was a great deal.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.543
It probably costs

17:23.584 --> 17:25.378
ten times that amount to wire

17:23.584 --> 17:25.378
that deputy's jaw shut.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.505
He totally deserved

17:25.419 --> 17:27.505
what happened.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.089
This is not helping us.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.091
Look, here's the settlement

17:29.131 --> 17:31.091
check from the tribe.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.593
We can use it to pay your fine.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.094
I'm not taking a settlement

17:34.136 --> 17:35.262
and I'm not paying the fine.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.389
I'm getting a real lawyer

17:36.430 --> 17:37.682
and taking this to trial.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.517
That would take

17:37.724 --> 17:39.517
four or five months.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.101
There is a bulldozer in the yard

17:41.143 --> 17:42.770
and it is going to flatten

17:41.143 --> 17:42.770
this house

17:42.812 --> 17:44.104
whether we're in it or not!

17:44.146 --> 17:46.024
I'm not scared

17:44.146 --> 17:46.024
of a bulldozer.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.608
You know what?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.608
The bulldozer doesn't care

17:47.650 --> 17:49.193
if you're scared or not.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.528
It will still crush you.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.905
We have to get out of here.

17:51.946 --> 17:52.947
I can't.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.198
Why are you so scared to leave?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.492
I don't know.

17:56.534 --> 18:00.038
Francis, I've been

17:56.534 --> 18:00.038
on this reservation

18:00.079 --> 18:01.288
my whole life.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.958
I don't know anything else.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.418
I'm just a hick.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.003
I'm not like you.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.713
I can't just pick up

18:08.755 --> 18:12.132
and start a new life

18:08.755 --> 18:12.132
whenever I need to.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.427
I'm not as brave

18:12.174 --> 18:14.427
as you, okay?

18:14.468 --> 18:16.763
Brave?

18:16.804 --> 18:19.766
I'm not brave.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.766
I just didn't know any better.

18:19.807 --> 18:20.975
What?

18:21.017 --> 18:23.770
If I had had any idea

18:21.017 --> 18:23.770
of how horrible it was up here,

18:23.811 --> 18:25.145
I never would have come.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.981
And I never

18:25.187 --> 18:26.981
would have met you.

18:28.274 --> 18:31.151
I'm not brave,

18:28.274 --> 18:31.151
I'm just stupid and lucky.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.738
And you're with me now,

18:33.780 --> 18:36.198
so my stupid luck

18:33.780 --> 18:36.198
will take care of you.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.540
Hopefully, one-fifteenth of a

18:41.120 --> 18:44.540
share will pay off our fine

18:44.582 --> 18:46.876
and maybe buy us a bus ticket.

18:46.918 --> 18:47.835
Oh, my God.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.462
What?

18:49.503 --> 18:50.546
Oh, my God.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.339
That's more than I made

18:50.588 --> 18:52.339
all last year.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.174
See, this is what

18:52.381 --> 18:54.174
I'm talking about.

18:55.885 --> 18:59.931
HAL:

18:55.885 --> 18:59.931
Craig, you in there?

19:03.225 --> 19:05.895
Craig? What happened?

19:07.313 --> 19:08.731
Behind you.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.819
(gasps)

19:12.860 --> 19:14.570
What the hell's wrong

19:12.860 --> 19:14.570
with that monkey?

19:14.612 --> 19:15.780
He's crazy.

19:15.822 --> 19:19.241
Well, he picked the wrong guy

19:15.822 --> 19:19.241
to mess with.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.284
(screams)

19:20.326 --> 19:21.494
CRAIG:

19:20.326 --> 19:21.494
Oh, no!

19:21.535 --> 19:22.829
God, please, no!

19:24.246 --> 19:26.373
Hang on, Craig.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.875
No, leave me.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.875
Save yourself.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.209
I am not going

19:29.251 --> 19:31.211
to leave you here, buddy.

19:31.253 --> 19:34.007
(grunting)

19:34.048 --> 19:36.216
You'll be safe here.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.059
(falsetto groan)

19:47.269 --> 19:49.229
Not my Romulans.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.950
(monkey squeals)

20:00.992 --> 20:02.118
(groans)

20:02.326 --> 20:03.077
Oh!

20:03.703 --> 20:04.745
Oof!

20:04.787 --> 20:06.873
(chattering)

20:18.718 --> 20:23.514
I always pictured

20:18.718 --> 20:23.514
an ending like this.

20:25.808 --> 20:27.560
(monkey squealing)

20:27.601 --> 20:32.940
Take that, you damn,

20:27.601 --> 20:32.940
dirty helper monkey!

20:32.982 --> 20:35.275
So, where do you want to go?

20:35.317 --> 20:36.276
I don't care.

20:36.318 --> 20:39.155
All I know is we've

20:36.318 --> 20:39.155
got $2,000 left

20:39.197 --> 20:41.115
and a car

20:39.197 --> 20:41.115
pointed south.

20:54.795 --> 20:55.713
(yawns)

20:55.755 --> 20:58.298
Read it to

20:55.755 --> 20:58.298
me again, Dad.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.759
(chuckles)

20:59.800 --> 21:00.760
Okay, son.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.387
"Local man subdues monkey.

21:03.429 --> 21:07.391
"A disabled man

21:03.429 --> 21:07.391
was saved by a local hero

21:07.433 --> 21:09.143
when he was..."

21:11.145 --> 21:12.688
Oh...

21:12.730 --> 21:14.107
I can't believe it.

21:14.148 --> 21:16.234
Dewey's finally

21:14.148 --> 21:16.234
fallen asleep.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.319
I'm only 11 hours away

21:16.275 --> 21:19.319
from the world record.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.281
So, at least some

21:19.361 --> 21:22.281
good will come of...

21:23.783 --> 21:28.037
"Experts say the capuchin monkey

21:23.783 --> 21:28.037
can weigh up to nine pounds.

21:28.079 --> 21:33.542
'He's a real hero,' said victim

21:28.079 --> 21:33.542
Craig Feldspar, age 36."

21:33.584 --> 21:35.586
"A real hero."
