00:02.969 --> 00:04.340
We start shooting in three days,

00:04.380 --> 00:06.086
and this whole show is
on the brink of imploding

00:06.110 --> 00:07.610
before we even film it.

00:07.650 --> 00:08.756
I care about Jason Priestley.

00:08.780 --> 00:09.950
- Wow.
- Wow.

00:09.980 --> 00:11.080
<i>This son of a bitch slept</i>

00:11.120 --> 00:12.126
with my wife
and got her pregnant!

00:12.150 --> 00:13.850
It's not my fault
your wife wasn't being

00:13.890 --> 00:15.420
satisfied at home!

00:15.450 --> 00:16.490
I'm the new head writer.

00:16.520 --> 00:17.490
<i>We need to fix</i>

00:17.520 --> 00:18.590
the script.

00:18.620 --> 00:19.760
It makes me want to draw

00:19.790 --> 00:21.120
a warm bath and slit my wrists.

00:21.160 --> 00:22.360
Why are you helping me?

00:22.390 --> 00:23.690
I'm trying this new thing

00:23.730 --> 00:25.190
where I don't make it
all about me.

00:25.230 --> 00:26.260
<i>This doesn't change</i>

00:26.300 --> 00:27.460
<i>how I feel about you.</i>

00:27.500 --> 00:28.700
<i>How could it not, Gab?</i>

00:28.730 --> 00:30.616
You say you're into women now,
and I'm not a woman.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.439
I can't get involved
with a client.

00:32.470 --> 00:34.590
How about I call Fox tomorrow
and have you reassigned?

00:35.710 --> 00:36.840
<i>You believe that</i>

00:36.880 --> 00:38.810
you don't measure up,
and I think you do.

00:38.840 --> 00:39.810
<i>I'm starting to have feelings</i>

00:39.840 --> 00:41.310
for Brian again.

00:41.350 --> 00:43.780
- Zach, you're a stalker, you're a thief.
- I'm your son.

00:43.820 --> 00:45.520
<i>There's still a stalker
out there.</i>

00:45.550 --> 00:46.820
<i>It's scary.</i>

00:50.590 --> 00:53.820
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:53.860 --> 00:57.360

world tour...

Do you guys feel nervous?

03:37.190 --> 03:39.196
I mean, the fact that
we're actually shooting today?

03:39.220 --> 03:41.620
Well, as long as someone
doesn't burn down the rest

03:41.660 --> 03:43.830
- of our sets, we're good.
- Yeah, I'm nervous,

03:43.860 --> 03:45.660
but I'm excited
to work with you guys.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.560
- Good morning!
- Morning!

03:47.600 --> 03:50.530
- Hey.
- I found this sweet little angel

03:50.570 --> 03:52.070
wandering the lot
all by himself.

03:52.100 --> 03:54.170
He could get hit by a truck.

03:54.210 --> 03:55.640
- Isn't he sweet?
- Oh, yeah.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.310
Cute little puddum.

03:57.340 --> 03:58.716
I guess I'm rescuing
yet another dog,

03:58.740 --> 04:00.086
'cause who could say "no"
to that face?

04:00.110 --> 04:01.210
He's like a gremlin.

04:02.250 --> 04:03.410
Hey.

04:03.450 --> 04:04.680
- Oh, Shan?
- Yeah.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.180
That's Musso.

04:06.220 --> 04:07.420
- What is?
- That dog.

04:07.450 --> 04:08.920
That's actually my dog... Musso.

04:08.950 --> 04:11.050
I-I guess the kids let him out
of my trailer.

04:11.090 --> 04:12.590
Are you sure?

04:12.620 --> 04:14.060
- Yeah.
- This is your dog?

04:14.090 --> 04:15.260
Yup.

04:15.290 --> 04:16.560
Is he microchipped?

04:16.589 --> 04:19.029
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

04:19.060 --> 04:21.100
Yeah, definitely.
Will you give me the dog?

04:21.130 --> 04:22.500
Give her the dog already.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.500
Poor thing, you know?

04:24.540 --> 04:25.540
Thanks, Shan.

04:25.570 --> 04:26.740
You guys, I can't believe

04:26.770 --> 04:28.440
- that we're really doing this.
- I know.

04:28.470 --> 04:29.910
No turning back now, bitches.

04:29.940 --> 04:31.540
Nope. The cameras are rolling.

04:31.580 --> 04:33.840
Oh, I should have gotten
more Botox.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.010
Remember when we used
to not be so self-conscious

04:36.050 --> 04:37.210
about the way we looked?

04:37.250 --> 04:38.410
- No.
- Mm.

04:38.450 --> 04:39.950
I think at a certain point,

04:39.980 --> 04:42.050
we should just sort of,
you know, embrace the fact

04:42.090 --> 04:43.896
that we're aging,
'cause it's beautiful, kind of.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.420
Please, speak for yourself.

04:45.460 --> 04:47.460
At least you guys don't have
to do a sex scene.

04:47.490 --> 04:49.930
I was self-conscious
about those when I was 20.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.476
Right? They were always
a little awkward.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.560
Thanks. That's helping.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.200
Do you think
the guys get awkward?

04:54.230 --> 04:55.930
- No, I think they like it.
- They did

04:55.970 --> 04:58.300
seem to get a little excited
sometimes, right?

04:58.340 --> 05:01.140
- Their acting would get a little stiff.
- A little wooden.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.470
Just saying.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.710
But it's embarrassing
for them, too, right?

05:04.740 --> 05:06.280
I don't know.
Why don't you ask Brian

05:06.310 --> 05:07.780
when you do your love scene
with him?

05:07.810 --> 05:09.580
- See if he's got a stiffy.
- Ooh.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.410
Or what if it happens?

05:11.450 --> 05:12.650
I don't know what's worse...

05:12.680 --> 05:14.880
If it does happen
or if it doesn't happen.

05:14.920 --> 05:18.150
Why does my first scene up have
to be a love scene with Brian?

05:18.190 --> 05:20.160
Who cares?
It's gonna be easy.

05:20.190 --> 05:22.990
I mean, you have so much...
experience...

05:23.030 --> 05:24.960
from the past with him...

05:25.000 --> 05:26.630
in my house.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.330
Oh, my God.
Always your house?

05:29.370 --> 05:31.430
Come on, Tor. You guys
are married, you have kids.

05:31.470 --> 05:33.140
It's not like
you're teenagers anymore.

05:33.170 --> 05:34.400
Yeah, it's just Brian.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.610
- Yeah, it's just Brian.
- It's just Brian.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.710
Just Brian.

05:46.850 --> 05:48.450
Hey, Brian?

05:49.490 --> 05:51.620
Hey.

05:51.660 --> 05:53.320
I am so sorry

05:53.360 --> 05:55.436
that I've been radio silent
for the past couple days.

05:55.460 --> 05:58.790
I needed some time
to process all this, you know?

05:58.830 --> 06:01.130
Finding out who you were,
who you are.

06:01.170 --> 06:02.930
- It's completely my fault.
- Not your fault.

06:02.970 --> 06:05.600
I don't know if there's a right
way to do all this, you know?

06:05.640 --> 06:07.640
I hope not.

06:07.670 --> 06:10.370
Hey, the good news is,
I've got a son.

06:10.410 --> 06:12.540
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.380
Yeah, I guess so,
if-if you're cool with that.

06:14.410 --> 06:15.710
Of course I'm cool with that.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.380
Is Shay pissed?

06:17.420 --> 06:20.220
I didn't tell her yet.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.720
Y-You don't want to tell her?

06:21.750 --> 06:23.350
No, no, no,
I totally want to tell her.

06:23.390 --> 06:25.396
I just want to... I want to
make sure it's the right time.

06:25.420 --> 06:26.620
Okay. Yeah.

06:26.660 --> 06:28.660
So given the circumstances,

06:28.690 --> 06:30.060
you being my assistant...

06:30.090 --> 06:31.690
It's... it's a little weird now.

06:31.730 --> 06:35.160
Yeah. I... I kind of
saw this coming.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.376
I was thinking maybe
instead of that,

06:36.400 --> 06:38.630
you could work here at the show.

06:38.670 --> 06:41.570
For real? Yeah.
Yeah, that would be amazing.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.140
Like, doing what?

06:43.170 --> 06:45.040
Like, a PA kind of thing?

06:45.080 --> 06:46.410
- Okay.
- I think

06:46.440 --> 06:48.310
I can pull some strings
around the zip code.

06:48.350 --> 06:49.750
All right. Sign me up.

06:51.380 --> 06:52.980
<i>Greens are pretty fast today.</i>

06:53.020 --> 06:55.220
<i>Ooh!</i>

06:55.250 --> 06:57.820
How is golf on
this early in the morning?

06:57.860 --> 06:59.360
It's the Golf Channel.

06:59.390 --> 07:01.320
Oh.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.430
Well, why don't I give you

07:03.460 --> 07:05.830
something more interesting
to watch than golf?

07:05.860 --> 07:07.700
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

07:07.730 --> 07:09.776
You're not even supposed to be
in here. You know that, right?

07:09.800 --> 07:11.900
Thought you were getting
reassigned.

07:11.940 --> 07:13.900
They're having a hard time
finding a replacement.

07:13.940 --> 07:16.210
- Why?
- All the other guys are scared of you.

07:17.410 --> 07:19.180
Well, I guess
you're stuck with me then.

07:19.210 --> 07:21.180
That's okay,
because I've decided

07:21.210 --> 07:23.080
to wave
my no-dating-a-client policy.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.110
Mm.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.750
- Mm.
- Yeah?

07:28.790 --> 07:31.550
You know, I was thinking,
maybe tonight,

07:31.590 --> 07:33.520
we could drive over
to Sherman Oaks.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.760
Oh.

07:34.790 --> 07:35.936
Play a little game of Putt-Putt.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.960
Oh.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.600
That sounds great. Hmm.

07:41.630 --> 07:43.630
At least no one'll see us.

07:46.140 --> 07:47.740
I hope my rewrite works.

07:47.770 --> 07:49.586
I mean, they change their mind
every five minutes,

07:49.610 --> 07:50.870
what sets they're rebuilding.

07:50.910 --> 07:52.910
Well, that's nothing new.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.110
Are you nervous?

07:54.150 --> 07:55.540
Nervous? Heck, no.

07:55.580 --> 07:57.426
Playing Steve Sanders
is like falling off a bike.

07:57.450 --> 07:59.820
Look, Anna,
your rewrite is great.

07:59.850 --> 08:01.920
- You worked hard on it. Own it.
- Yeah, I worked

08:01.950 --> 08:04.120
hard on it the first time, too,
and I got smacked down.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.590
We all get smacked down,
but you honored the struggle

08:06.620 --> 08:08.406
and brought the work
that excellence requires.

08:08.430 --> 08:11.390
Jeez, Ian, you're starting
to sound like a life coach.

08:11.430 --> 08:14.060
You deserve
to celebrate the success

08:14.100 --> 08:15.760
and share in the joy.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.130
I'll try and keep that in mind.

08:18.170 --> 08:19.400
No, you won't.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.870
But I'll keep reminding you.

08:21.940 --> 08:24.170
We should Netflix and chill
sometime?

08:24.210 --> 08:26.110
Totally.

08:26.140 --> 08:27.610
Need you on set.

08:27.650 --> 08:31.080
They need all the actors
on the Peach Pit set.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.120
I got to go.

08:33.150 --> 08:34.480
Me, too.

08:38.860 --> 08:40.500
Then he made it naked. - Ugh.
Bad, right?

08:43.830 --> 08:45.030
Clear the set!

08:45.060 --> 08:46.600
Everybody except actors!

08:46.630 --> 08:48.960
- Clear the set, please.
- What's up?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.270
Clear the set?
What's going on?

08:50.300 --> 08:51.530
What's going on is

08:51.570 --> 08:53.270
that no one will insure
this production

08:53.300 --> 08:54.986
as long as there's an active
threat out there.

08:55.010 --> 08:56.140
We don't need insurance.

08:56.170 --> 08:58.010
Yes, we do.
This is one of the only sets

08:58.040 --> 08:59.640
that didn't burn down
in the fire.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.656
Who's the insurance company?
Let's give them a call.

09:01.680 --> 09:02.880
You guys are delusional.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.180
On a good day, it's helpful.

09:04.220 --> 09:05.510
Maybe, but today's a bad day.

09:05.550 --> 09:06.896
- We're getting shut down. Oh.
- No!

09:06.920 --> 09:07.880
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, what?

09:07.920 --> 09:09.650
I just told Jason.

09:09.690 --> 09:10.950
He took it pretty well.

09:14.230 --> 09:15.620
Unbelievable.

09:15.660 --> 09:17.060
Yet it's so easy to believe.

09:17.090 --> 09:20.030
And on top of everything else,
we have an HR investigation.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.000
- Oh, that sucks.
- You can't say that.

09:22.030 --> 09:23.670
- That bites.
- You can't say that.

09:23.700 --> 09:25.470
- It blows?
- Nothing with a mouth.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.140
What they want to know is if

09:27.170 --> 09:29.470
this deranged loon
is a disgruntled employee.

09:29.510 --> 09:30.840
It's 2019.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.340
Zero intolerance toward
any inappropriate behavior.

09:33.380 --> 09:34.710
- I miss the '90s.
- Me, too.

09:34.750 --> 09:36.580
- Me, too.
- I'm good.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.180
So, be on your best behavior

09:38.220 --> 09:40.196
and pray these investigators
come up with something.

09:40.220 --> 09:41.920
Well, we can't keep
getting shut down.

09:41.950 --> 09:44.050
- How do we continue to film?
- I don't know.

09:44.090 --> 09:45.350
Go find the lunatic.

09:45.390 --> 09:46.360
Let's find a lunatic.

09:46.390 --> 09:47.360
Oh, I found a lunatic.

09:47.390 --> 09:49.330
We have professionals on this.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.006
Oh, yeah, 'cause they've been
doing such a great job.

09:51.030 --> 09:53.730
Okay, well, if you can do
better, Scooby Doo, have at it.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.930
But until then, be ready

09:54.970 --> 09:56.890
to clean out your trailers
by the end of the day.

10:56.490 --> 10:57.736
Hey. Uh, Chris.
Chris, uh, sorry.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.806
Are you avoiding me?
I mean, you haven't talked to me

10:59.830 --> 11:01.000
- since... you know.
- No.

11:01.030 --> 11:02.500
No, it's not that.
It's just,

11:02.530 --> 11:04.900
given all this HR stuff,

11:04.940 --> 11:07.170
things have gotten
really complicated.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.140
- What are you talking about?
- In terms

11:09.170 --> 11:10.140
of our business relationship.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.510
You're an employee.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.680
And that puts me at risk.

11:13.710 --> 11:15.226
Oh, wait, wait.
Everything that's going on,

11:15.250 --> 11:16.656
you're telling me
that the network cares

11:16.680 --> 11:17.710
who you sleep with?

11:17.750 --> 11:19.210
#MeToo.

11:19.250 --> 11:20.720
And...

11:20.750 --> 11:22.580
I need you to sign
a consent form.

11:22.620 --> 11:24.350
- A what?
- Consent form saying

11:24.390 --> 11:26.790
that you consent to have
a sexual relationship with me.

11:28.030 --> 11:29.890
If you did me a solid
and backdated it,

11:29.930 --> 11:31.560
it would really help me out.

11:33.700 --> 11:36.230
- This can't be happening.
- Oh, it is happening, Tor.

11:36.270 --> 11:38.230
Screw 'em. We're family.
We're staying together,

11:38.270 --> 11:39.600
whether they like it or not.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.170
You're right.
We're not giving up.

11:41.210 --> 11:42.286
We're gonna have
to take action, then.

11:42.310 --> 11:43.840
Planning and teamwork.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.570
Gabrielle's right.
I mean, if we quit now,

11:45.610 --> 11:47.286
- this lunatic wins.
- Well, then we just got

11:47.310 --> 11:48.910
to find this creep
and get our show back.

11:48.950 --> 11:51.680
Well, then, let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.250
- Got work to do.
- Bring your sandwich.

11:56.820 --> 11:58.036
Okay, everyone, come on.
We need more names.

11:58.060 --> 11:59.390
People who have it out for us.

11:59.420 --> 12:01.590
We only have 125 so far,
and we need more.

12:01.630 --> 12:05.630
I might have accidentally given
Christina Aguilera side-eye

12:05.660 --> 12:07.300
when she played
the Peach Pit After Dark.

12:07.330 --> 12:09.400
- You might have?
- Accidentally.

12:09.430 --> 12:11.316
I thought this was just people
we intentionally offended.

12:11.340 --> 12:12.970
Now we have to add accidentals?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.916
I knew people were holding back,
so come on. Let's go.

12:14.940 --> 12:17.740
Ivanka Trump. She had it out for
me when I did <i> The Apprentice.</i>

12:17.780 --> 12:19.740
Wayne Newton.
Very sore loser.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.886
<i>Dancing with the Stars.</i> Right.

12:20.910 --> 12:22.226
That girl that I danced with.
Cheryl,

12:22.250 --> 12:23.480
- um...
- Burke.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.750
- Cheryl Burke.
- Oh.

12:24.780 --> 12:26.750
Spelled B-E-R-Z-E-R-K.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.120
Okay.

12:28.150 --> 12:29.790
- Uh, Vanilla Ice.
- Why?

12:29.820 --> 12:31.290
- He knows.
- I've really learned

12:31.320 --> 12:33.390
to love the people that hate me,

12:33.420 --> 12:36.130
like those "I Hate Brenda"
newsletter bitches.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.990
That's very inspirational.

12:38.030 --> 12:40.130
- And so convincing.
- Thank you.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.100
The prop guy
from the first two seasons.

12:42.130 --> 12:43.330
How many exes do I have?

12:43.370 --> 12:44.330
Ben Kenobi.

12:44.370 --> 12:46.340
Jerry Seinfeld,
'cause I stalked him

12:46.370 --> 12:48.116
for a really long time.
He's hot. I still stalk him,

12:48.140 --> 12:50.170
- to be truthful.
- Cole Hauser hates me.

12:50.210 --> 12:51.270
- He hates her.
- Why?

12:51.310 --> 12:52.980
- Who is Cole Hauser?
- Exactly.

12:53.010 --> 12:54.186
All the people
on <i> Saved by the Bell.</i>

12:54.210 --> 12:56.080
- Mike Meyers.
- Paris Hilton.

12:56.110 --> 12:57.456
- She was nice to me.
- I'm sure she was.

12:57.480 --> 12:58.810
You had sex with Paris Hilton?

12:58.850 --> 13:00.796
You can paint this picture,
but I'm not gonna frame it.

13:00.820 --> 13:02.820
Anakin Skywalker.
He didn't like me.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.136
You know what,
this is pointless, guys.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.590
Yeah, this is quantity

13:05.620 --> 13:07.590
over quality.
We need one name

13:07.630 --> 13:09.660
of a person
that <i> really</i> hates us.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.106
- I got to get home.
- Before you do, you guys,

13:14.130 --> 13:16.470
I need you to text me
at least 25 more names

13:16.500 --> 13:17.630
- by tomorrow morning.
- 25?

13:17.670 --> 13:19.100
I had trouble coming up
with four.

13:19.140 --> 13:20.800
Ooh.
Corey Feldman.<i> Surreal Life.</i>

13:22.510 --> 13:24.170
- Hey, B.
- Hmm?

13:24.210 --> 13:26.280
If a girl asked you
to Netflix and chill,

13:26.310 --> 13:27.510
is that a date?

13:27.550 --> 13:29.510
Uh, I don't know.

13:29.550 --> 13:31.950
But if it is,
it sounds like a cheap one.

13:31.980 --> 13:34.050
You know what?
Let's get our steps in.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.220
Let's take the stairs.

13:35.250 --> 13:37.490
- The stairs?
- Yes.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.160
- What is wrong with you?
- Everything.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.730
- Sometime today, sister. Let's go.
- All right, stop.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.530
Move it. Oh, my God!

13:46.560 --> 13:47.800
- Oh!
- Tor!

13:47.830 --> 13:48.800
Oh, my God.

13:48.830 --> 13:50.130
Oh, geez.

13:50.170 --> 13:51.830
Are you okay?

13:51.870 --> 13:53.540
- Yeah.
- What...

13:53.570 --> 13:54.670
What happened?

13:55.940 --> 13:57.410
Oh, my God.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.410
I know who it is.
The stalker.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.020
Well, even if T was wrong,

14:09.050 --> 14:10.520
this place is pretty cool.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.590
Yeah, and only
a two-hour drive from L.A.

14:12.620 --> 14:15.160
At least it was
a comfortable ride.

14:15.190 --> 14:16.536
How would you know?
You were sleeping.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.860
Yeah, 'cause there's
all this space in the third row.

14:22.430 --> 14:23.600
Hey, you guys made it.

14:23.630 --> 14:24.870
Hey. Yeah, we did.

14:24.900 --> 14:26.316
StStill need
to secure the perimeter,

14:26.340 --> 14:27.486
check out ingress and egress,

14:27.510 --> 14:28.900
in case something goes down.

14:28.940 --> 14:30.570
Mm, I love it
when you talk dirty.

14:30.610 --> 14:32.286
Hey, Costner, are you allowed
to date the clients?

14:32.310 --> 14:33.480
Gone rogue.

14:33.510 --> 14:35.440
Besides,
I'll be the one laughing

14:35.480 --> 14:37.456
when you're barbecued
and chopped into little bits.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.480
- Take it easy.
- Pretty dark, Jen.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.120
Tor, you sure
you want to do this?

14:41.150 --> 14:43.320
Absolutely. Let's go.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.020
Let's go.

14:48.290 --> 14:49.790
So how 'bout it?

14:49.830 --> 14:53.950
Well. Want to get a beer?

14:53.980 --> 14:56.050
I would like a beer, please.

- That's what they say.

15:13.930 --> 15:15.470
So, Ray

15:15.500 --> 15:17.840
dated Donna
and then Ray pushed Donna

15:17.870 --> 15:19.470
down the stairs.
It got a little dark.

15:19.510 --> 15:21.570
Yeah. And he took the blame
for it in real life.

15:21.610 --> 15:24.310
- The actor?
- Yeah. Isn't that crazy?

15:24.350 --> 15:25.680
The fans started hating him

15:25.710 --> 15:27.226
because he pushed Donna
down the stairs.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.910
Totally messed up his career.

Thanks for coming out.

16:13.460 --> 16:14.660
So it was you all along.

- What?
- "Stop acting like I'm not even here"?

16:19.770 --> 16:21.676

- You severed my limbs.
- You sliced my arms.

16:29.140 --> 16:30.940
Jamie, we understand.
You're mad.

16:30.980 --> 16:32.240
I am not mad.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.356
What do you mean,
you're not mad?

16:33.380 --> 16:35.110

16:39.120 --> 16:40.950
You threatened us
and stalked us,

16:40.990 --> 16:42.890
so much that I got freaked out

16:42.920 --> 16:45.220
and I had to have
a bodyguard follow me around.

16:45.260 --> 16:47.090
Listen, whatever you guys think
I did...

16:47.130 --> 16:48.690
We think
you burned down our sets.

17:00.070 --> 17:02.370
I quit acting
and became a firefighter, right?

17:02.410 --> 17:04.880
I put out fires.
I don't start 'em.

17:04.910 --> 17:06.750
Why are you guys accusing me
of this stuff?

17:06.780 --> 17:09.650
Because you pushed me
down the stairs.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.150
Well, my character.

17:11.190 --> 17:12.950
Remember all the hate mail
you got over that?

17:12.990 --> 17:15.990
Yeah. Yeah, pretty much ruined
my acting career.

17:16.020 --> 17:18.819
You don't think maybe it had
anything to do with that song?

17:18.859 --> 17:21.160
Which was great,
because I ended up

17:21.200 --> 17:23.630
doing something so much better
with my life.

17:23.660 --> 17:25.760
Lot more important
than being an actor.

- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Guys, look, I-I try to help people

<i>Never a dull moment</i>

17:46.450 --> 17:49.790
<i>This evening, Johnson Deitz
was arrested in Downey...</i>

17:49.820 --> 17:51.590
That was that guy.

17:51.630 --> 17:53.660
- Ooh, it's that guy.
- Huh. -Tor.

17:53.690 --> 17:56.700
<i>Sources say</i>
<i>he's an obsessive</i> 90210 <i> fan</i>

17:56.730 --> 17:58.500
<i>who owned the red dress</i>

17:58.530 --> 18:02.430
<i>recently stolen by Tori
Spelling at a fan convention.</i>

18:02.470 --> 18:04.170
<i>At this point,
we have to wonder,</i>

18:04.200 --> 18:06.100
<i>will this reboot
ever get off the ground?</i>

18:07.540 --> 18:09.110
Oh, this reboot
is totally getting

18:09.140 --> 18:10.480
- off the ground.
- Mm.

18:10.510 --> 18:12.810
Jamie, I'm so sorry.

18:12.850 --> 18:14.610
For what,
ruining my acting career

18:14.650 --> 18:17.820
or falsely accusing me
of arson and terrorism?

18:17.850 --> 18:19.990
How can we make it up to you?

18:20.020 --> 18:21.650
Mm, I have an idea.

18:23.360 --> 18:26.960
♪ <i>How do you talk to an angel?</i> ♪

18:28.760 --> 18:34.000

18:46.850 --> 18:48.510

- All right.

18:48.550 --> 18:50.070
- That was so good.
- That was awesome!

18:55.560 --> 18:57.090
Come in.

18:58.590 --> 19:00.090
Hey.

19:00.130 --> 19:01.760
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.430
- What's up?
- Hey, Tori.

19:03.460 --> 19:04.860
What are you guys... doing?

19:04.900 --> 19:06.360
Watching golf.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.000
It's the playoffs.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.670
- Masters.
- Right.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.040
Jen, I have a problem.

19:11.070 --> 19:12.840
They scheduled my sex scene
with Brian

19:12.870 --> 19:13.940
- first up again.
- Oh,

19:13.970 --> 19:15.410
- this is a hard shot.
- Oh!

19:15.440 --> 19:16.510
It's so exciting.

19:16.540 --> 19:17.886
- I hope he makes it.
- No, we don't like

19:17.910 --> 19:19.410
- this guy.
- Oh. Okay.

19:19.450 --> 19:20.626
Well, I hope he doesn't make it.

19:20.650 --> 19:22.410
- You hate golf.
- You hate golf?

19:22.450 --> 19:24.450
- I like golf.
- She likes golf.

19:24.490 --> 19:26.790
You threw your ex-husband's
golf clubs out the window.

19:26.820 --> 19:28.050
I don't remember doing that.

19:28.090 --> 19:30.590
Hey, Tori, you should come by
after you wrap.

19:30.620 --> 19:32.190
We're gonna be having
a barbecue.

19:32.230 --> 19:34.036
My friend's coming over
with this amazing craft brew

19:34.060 --> 19:35.030
from his microbrewery.

19:35.060 --> 19:37.130
- I love crafting.
- Okay.

19:37.160 --> 19:39.760
Um, can I talk to you outside
for a second?

19:41.170 --> 19:43.500
- 'Kay.
- Okay. Mm.

19:46.940 --> 19:49.110
- What?
- Who are you?

19:50.140 --> 19:51.810
Come on. I'm having fun.

19:51.850 --> 19:53.040
And look at him.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.450
And he's crazy about me.

19:54.480 --> 19:55.880
And the sex...

19:55.920 --> 19:56.880
Mmm, the sex.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.980
I forgot it could be
so mind-blowing.

19:59.020 --> 20:00.220
And I have endorphins again.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.620
- Endorphins.
- Oh, please.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.060
You have six kids. It's
not like you're not getting any.

20:04.090 --> 20:05.390
And if you are, stop.

20:05.430 --> 20:08.060
Honestly, the only sex
I am thinking about right now

20:08.100 --> 20:09.430
is the scene with Brian.

20:09.460 --> 20:11.260
Okay, why are you so freaked out
by this?

20:11.300 --> 20:12.500
I don't know.

20:12.530 --> 20:13.770
No, I do know.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.430
It's 'cause he was my first.

20:15.470 --> 20:17.940
And now I'm having feelings
for him again.

20:17.970 --> 20:20.140
And I have to kiss him
under hot lights

20:20.170 --> 20:21.986
in front of a crew
and act like I'm not enjoying,

20:22.010 --> 20:23.610
acting like I'm enjoying it.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.510
So enjoy it. Or don't.

20:25.550 --> 20:27.110
It doesn't matter.

20:27.150 --> 20:29.110
Okay?
It's just a little sex scene.

20:29.150 --> 20:30.680
It's not real.

20:30.720 --> 20:31.780
Like these.

20:31.820 --> 20:33.450
Now go have fun.

20:37.860 --> 20:39.790
How long you been skating?

20:39.830 --> 20:41.460
Uh, just about a year.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.360
That's awesome.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.460
You know what's funny?
I was thinking about it.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.800
I, uh... I-I think
I was younger than you

20:48.840 --> 20:51.540
when I met your mom.

20:51.570 --> 20:53.510
Yeah. I can do basic math.

20:53.540 --> 20:54.770
Fair enough.

20:54.810 --> 20:56.610
I'm just saying,
I was... I was young.

20:56.640 --> 20:59.640
Your mom didn't-didn't talk
about much.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.310
Yeah, she didn't want to.

21:01.350 --> 21:04.350
Sh-She didn't even want
to tell me about anything.

21:04.380 --> 21:07.320
It's a part of her life
she just kind of closed off.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.150
- Why?
- I don't know.

21:09.190 --> 21:11.690
I-I guess, uh...
she came to L.A. thinking

21:11.730 --> 21:13.890
she was gonna be Julia Roberts
or something.

21:13.930 --> 21:14.990
And then, uh...

21:15.030 --> 21:17.030
then she was an extra on <i> 90210,</i>

21:17.060 --> 21:18.206
and that's as good as it got.

21:18.230 --> 21:19.530
I totally remember.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.570
We had this
small group of extras

21:21.600 --> 21:23.000
that worked all the time.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.500
And-and we were kids,

21:24.540 --> 21:26.870
so we used to all party together
pretty hard.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.510
She really doesn't like

21:28.540 --> 21:29.686
- to talk about that.
- There you go.

21:29.710 --> 21:31.410
See? She raised a good kid.

21:32.450 --> 21:34.510
Thanks, Brian.

21:38.350 --> 21:40.090
You know, if you...

21:40.120 --> 21:42.250
if you want to... I mean,

21:42.290 --> 21:43.560
I don't expect you to...

21:43.590 --> 21:46.990
But you can... you can totally...

21:47.030 --> 21:48.490
call me Dad.

21:48.530 --> 21:50.260
Oh.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.200
I mean, it's-it's...

21:52.230 --> 21:54.230
It's...

21:54.270 --> 21:55.430
That was weird. That's...

21:55.470 --> 21:56.900
Uh, forget that I said that.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.070
That, uh...

21:58.110 --> 22:00.840
Uh... It's nice of you.

22:00.870 --> 22:05.040
It's just... Mom has been my mom
because she raised me.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.710
No. I... uh, yeah.
I don't-I don't...

22:06.750 --> 22:07.926
- I just got to know you.
- Totally.

22:07.950 --> 22:09.610
I don't want this
to be weird at all.

22:09.650 --> 22:11.750
Plus, h-have you told anyone?

22:13.820 --> 22:15.120
Uh...

22:15.160 --> 22:16.590
I don't think you should.

22:16.620 --> 22:18.190
Why not?

22:18.230 --> 22:19.960
I don't want people to think

22:19.990 --> 22:22.290
I pulled any strings
getting this PA job.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.460
And I don't think you're ready.

22:26.900 --> 22:29.300
And maybe the ship
has sailed on...

22:29.340 --> 22:31.140
on you being "Dad."

22:32.640 --> 22:34.110
I mean, I'm 20.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.950
I got to get back to work.

22:51.210 --> 22:52.340
- Hey, Brian.
- Hey.

22:52.380 --> 22:53.580
Got some pledges here for you.

22:53.610 --> 22:55.380
Oh, right on.
Cool. Thanks, man.

22:55.410 --> 22:58.110
Yeah.
You're welcome, man.

23:04.290 --> 23:06.220
- Morning.
- Hey.

23:06.260 --> 23:10.890
So, I see they have
our scene scheduled first up.

23:10.930 --> 23:13.900
- You finally got that sex scene you wanted.
- Yep.

23:13.930 --> 23:16.830
It's been, like, my God,

23:16.870 --> 23:19.400
20 years since we've done
one of these.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.000
Are you feeling nervous?

23:21.040 --> 23:24.040
- I am not.
- Okay.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.370
So deep thoughts.

23:25.410 --> 23:27.540
How do they maintain

23:27.580 --> 23:29.740
such an amazing marriage
after all these years?

23:29.780 --> 23:33.380
Well, Donna and David are in
an imaginary relationship

23:33.420 --> 23:35.420
so, uh, there's that.

23:35.450 --> 23:36.920
I have to work on these lines.

23:36.950 --> 23:38.390
I'll see you later, okay?

23:40.320 --> 23:42.960
Good talk.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.860
Thank you for coming in.

23:47.900 --> 23:51.070
Wow. So serious
all of a sudden.

23:51.100 --> 23:53.230
Sorry, this whole HR thing's
got me really spooked.

23:53.270 --> 23:55.400
I don't think I'm ever gonna
have sex again.

23:55.440 --> 23:56.810
It's way too risky.

23:57.940 --> 23:59.440
So is this your way
of saying that...

23:59.480 --> 24:01.080
It's not my way
of saying anything.

24:01.110 --> 24:04.110
Granted, I'm more of a player
than a stayer but I like you.

24:04.150 --> 24:05.550
A lot.

24:05.580 --> 24:08.180
- I think we're kindred spirits.
- All right, let's not get crazy.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.220
Are you saying if I sign this,
you'll date me?

24:11.250 --> 24:14.120
- 'Cause I am very confused.
- I know you are, Gab.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.160
What's the issue? Do you regret
having sex with me?

24:16.190 --> 24:17.430
Not at all.

24:17.460 --> 24:19.290
I-I just don't feel like
recording it

24:19.330 --> 24:20.960
on some gratuitous
legal document.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.230
- Is it something you're ashamed of?
- No.

24:23.270 --> 24:25.130
But I've only told
two other people, though.

24:25.170 --> 24:26.430
Well, I guess you're not ready.

24:26.470 --> 24:28.300
See, that's it. Ready for what?

24:28.340 --> 24:29.616
I don't even know
what I'm not ready for.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.140
And until I figure that out,

24:31.170 --> 24:33.110
why would I go and put it
on a piece of paper?

24:37.450 --> 24:38.510
Quiet on the set.

24:38.550 --> 24:39.780
Picture's up.

24:39.820 --> 24:40.996
All right, everybody,
let's do this.

24:41.020 --> 24:43.620
The all-new <i> 90210.</i>

24:43.650 --> 24:44.690
Oh, great.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.020
Now I feel really hot.

24:46.060 --> 24:47.420
Let's rehearse, guys.

24:47.460 --> 24:48.990
Nah, these guys don't need
to rehearse.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.206
You know how to do it, right,
guys? Just like old times.

24:51.230 --> 24:53.660
Well, except it's not
just like old times,

24:53.700 --> 24:55.100
'cause it's 20 years later.

24:55.130 --> 24:56.346
All right, we're ready to shoot.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.470
Red light and bell.

24:59.370 --> 25:00.640
Ready?

25:00.670 --> 25:01.840
Mm-hmm.

25:03.810 --> 25:05.110
All right.

25:05.140 --> 25:06.140
Okay.

25:06.180 --> 25:07.680
- Come on in.
- Yep.

25:07.710 --> 25:09.540
Here I come.

25:16.050 --> 25:18.890
Almost there.

25:22.090 --> 25:23.660
All right, you ready, guys?
Here we go.

25:25.030 --> 25:27.760
Scene 28, take one.

25:29.270 --> 25:31.900
And... action.

25:31.940 --> 25:33.200
Donna, you are the best thing

25:33.240 --> 25:34.540
that ever happened to me.

25:34.570 --> 25:36.240
I love you, David.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.240
Um, wait.

25:39.280 --> 25:40.740
- Can you see this?
- What?

25:40.780 --> 25:42.256
Jay, are you sure this is
a good angle?

25:42.280 --> 25:44.410
Should the camera be
a little higher for me?

25:44.450 --> 25:46.180
Tori. You look great.

25:46.220 --> 25:47.556
Just like you did
when you were 19.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.350
Oh, my God. Jay, shut up.

25:49.390 --> 25:50.890
Now I know you're lying.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.220
Are you getting my right side?

25:52.260 --> 25:54.320
Uh, actually more
your left side.

25:54.360 --> 25:57.660
No, you know that my right side
is my <i> right</i> side.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.660
- Yep, go ahead and cut it.
- Let's cut.

25:59.700 --> 26:01.100
Jason, can you come here,
please?

26:01.130 --> 26:02.376
Tori, what are you
talking about?

26:02.400 --> 26:04.270
Your good side, your bad side.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.370
Like, I can barely even see
your face in this shot.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.000
We're panning across the bed.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.170
Panning across what?

26:09.210 --> 26:10.340
Let's not worry about that.

26:10.370 --> 26:11.910
Well, I am worried about it

26:11.940 --> 26:14.180
because I'm the one
that's half naked in a bed here,

26:14.210 --> 26:15.610
and everyone is looking,

26:15.650 --> 26:17.380
and I'm not feeling
like I look good.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.426
Tori, I don't have time to shoot
around your insecurities.

26:19.450 --> 26:21.580
Okay, well, then you're gonna
have to reschedule

26:21.620 --> 26:23.380
when you can find the time.

26:23.420 --> 26:25.020
Sorry, Bri.

26:25.060 --> 26:26.450
Sorry, guys.

26:31.600 --> 26:34.830
So is that lunch?

26:37.970 --> 26:39.470
Hey, how's it going?

26:41.940 --> 26:43.440
It's a little stressful.

26:43.470 --> 26:45.140
I'm sorry to hear that.

26:45.180 --> 26:47.420
What do you say we grab a drink
and unwind after we wrap?

26:48.310 --> 26:50.040
Well, I, uh...

26:50.080 --> 26:52.550
Maybe we could
Netflix and chill.

26:54.420 --> 26:56.080
What's funny?

26:56.120 --> 26:58.490
You say that like it has
quotation marks around it.

26:58.520 --> 26:59.950
Those are your words.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.760
Sure. Let's hang.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.890
- Cool. Great.
- We can go to the Alston House.

27:06.930 --> 27:08.960
- Jason got me a membership.
- Got to love Jay.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.470
He's always working
those angles.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.070
I'd offer to pick you up, but...

27:12.100 --> 27:14.000
Let's meet there.

27:22.610 --> 27:23.610
Bri.

27:23.650 --> 27:24.850
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.080
Sorry about earlier.

27:26.120 --> 27:28.480
I-I just wanted it to be right.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.450
- What?
- Our sex scene.

27:30.490 --> 27:32.990
- Well, the one that wasn't.
- Ah, I'm not worried about it.

27:33.020 --> 27:34.190
Ah, of course you aren't.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.320
Guys never are.

27:36.860 --> 27:39.290
Are you okay?

27:39.330 --> 27:41.600
Yeah, of course.
Why wouldn't I be?

27:41.630 --> 27:43.000
I don't know.

27:43.030 --> 27:44.970
You just seem distant.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.530
Is it something I did, or...?

27:46.570 --> 27:47.840
No, no, no, Tori.

27:47.870 --> 27:49.470
It has nothing to do with you.

27:49.510 --> 27:50.810
Okay.

27:50.840 --> 27:53.680
Well, I'm here
if you want to talk.

27:53.710 --> 27:56.180
All right, all right.
I'll let you know.

28:01.650 --> 28:03.350
- Hi.
- Hey.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.020
You okay?

28:12.460 --> 28:14.230
I'm such an idiot.

28:14.260 --> 28:17.370
I mean, why would he possibly
want to call me "Dad"?

28:17.400 --> 28:19.770
Because you're his father and
he came here looking for you?

28:19.800 --> 28:21.200
He's 20.
He's 20 years old.

28:21.240 --> 28:22.716
I missed all that.
I wasn't there for him.

28:22.740 --> 28:24.110
Brian.

28:24.140 --> 28:26.610
I mean, you just met him,
you just found out.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.540
He asked me if I told anybody,

28:28.580 --> 28:31.210
and I had to tell him "no."

28:31.250 --> 28:33.110
Because I was embarrassed.

28:33.150 --> 28:34.520
I don't know how to tell people.

28:34.550 --> 28:35.920
I don't know how to tell Shay.

28:35.950 --> 28:40.390
I don't know how to tell
my kid... my other kids.

28:40.420 --> 28:42.460
Okay, let me ask you something.

28:42.490 --> 28:45.690
When... When you asked him
to call you "Dad,"

28:45.730 --> 28:47.730
did you ask because
it's what you wanted

28:47.760 --> 28:49.630
or because you thought
it's what he wanted?

28:52.500 --> 28:53.900
Both.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.470
There you have it.

28:56.510 --> 28:57.910
Look, you're father and son.

28:57.940 --> 28:59.810
Just focus on Zach right now.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.810
And you'll tell people
when the time is right.

29:10.820 --> 29:13.450
Hey, everyone.

29:13.490 --> 29:14.990
Is this a coincidence?

29:15.030 --> 29:17.560
Oh, I think we all needed
a drink after today.

29:17.590 --> 29:20.500
Ugh, I know.
We haven't shot a single scene.

29:20.530 --> 29:22.400
Mm. It's brutal.

29:22.430 --> 29:24.800
But I have a glass of wine

29:24.830 --> 29:27.140
and a tall drink of water,
so I'm good.

29:27.170 --> 29:28.240
Mmm.

29:30.340 --> 29:32.340
And I've got a gorgeous woman
and a bottle of beer,

29:32.380 --> 29:34.340
so I'm good.

29:34.380 --> 29:35.480
Mmm.

29:35.510 --> 29:36.840
Mm-hmm.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.680
You guys are such a cute couple.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.180
Thanks. Yeah, he's a good guy.

29:41.220 --> 29:43.120
And she's incredible.

29:43.150 --> 29:44.650
She lets me watch golf.

29:44.690 --> 29:46.250
Pretends that she likes it.

29:46.290 --> 29:47.620
No, I do.
I'm not pretending.

29:47.660 --> 29:49.290
- I do like it.
- Mm-hmm.

29:49.330 --> 29:51.290
Yes, it... there's...

29:53.360 --> 29:55.376
Ian, how about a couple
of the bourbon apple sangrias?

29:55.400 --> 29:56.500
They are amazing.

29:56.530 --> 29:58.830
- Sounds interesting.
- Excuse me.

29:58.870 --> 29:59.976
- Yes.
- Could we have a couple

30:00.000 --> 30:01.176
- of the bourbon apple sangrias, please?
- Mm-hmm.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.000
- You're gonna love them.
- Can't wait.

30:03.970 --> 30:04.970
- Hey.
- Mm.

30:05.010 --> 30:06.040
How about that new draft?

30:06.080 --> 30:07.280
It was great, wasn't it?

30:07.310 --> 30:08.880
Anna's worked so hard.

30:08.910 --> 30:10.710
Yeah, it was better.

30:10.750 --> 30:12.450
A lot of rewrites.

30:12.480 --> 30:15.350
So it's coming along, I think.

30:15.390 --> 30:16.950
Well, rewrites are good.

30:16.990 --> 30:18.226
It works out
your writing muscle,

30:18.250 --> 30:19.396
which is very strong,
by the way.

30:19.420 --> 30:20.660
My writing muscle.

30:20.690 --> 30:22.620
This guy is like
a one-man support system.

30:22.660 --> 30:25.130
Well, I do what I can to help.

30:25.160 --> 30:27.730
Yes, Ian is very helpful.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.030
Mm-hmm. It's like having
your own Tony Robbins

30:30.070 --> 30:31.870
right there with you
all the time.

30:31.900 --> 30:34.540
I said the same thing.

30:41.410 --> 30:42.980
What?

30:43.010 --> 30:44.150
I didn't say anything.

30:44.180 --> 30:46.380
That grin did.

30:46.420 --> 30:50.550
It's just really adorable
seeing you so head over heels.

30:50.590 --> 30:52.490
You're, like, girlish.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.190
It's really very sweet, Jen.

30:54.220 --> 30:57.760
Almost as sweet as your bourbon
apple sangria over there.

30:57.790 --> 30:59.890
What's that supposed to mean?

30:59.930 --> 31:04.200
I'm just seeing a lot
of life coaching and mentoring.

31:04.230 --> 31:06.176
Huh, you know, I'm seeing
a lot of spectator sports

31:06.200 --> 31:08.800
that I know
you have zero interest in.

31:09.870 --> 31:11.540
I'm trying new things.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.040
Maybe falling into old patterns.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.540
Maybe we both are.

31:14.580 --> 31:15.780
Yeah.

31:15.810 --> 31:17.880
Anna is a lucky girl,

31:17.910 --> 31:21.550
but you focus on you.

31:21.580 --> 31:22.550
Thanks.

31:22.590 --> 31:24.390
Right back at ya.

31:24.420 --> 31:26.290
- Love you, Jen.
- Mm.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.790
I love you.

31:27.820 --> 31:29.490
Good night.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.360
I can't believe Jason scheduled
my love scene

31:34.400 --> 31:36.460
with Brian first thing
in the morning again.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.476
It's like he's not even being
sensitive to the fact

31:38.500 --> 31:41.570
that I want to feel comfortable
and look good during it,

31:41.600 --> 31:43.146
otherwise what's the point
of shooting it?

31:43.170 --> 31:44.770
- Did you talk to Brian about it?
- Yeah.

31:44.810 --> 31:47.880
And he says nothing, like,
he literally is saying nothing.

31:47.910 --> 31:49.456
I don't know if he's
not comfortable with it

31:49.480 --> 31:51.480
or if it's me, or what,
but it's not working.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.150
- Why don't you have him hire an intimacy coordinator?
- A what?

31:54.180 --> 31:55.380
That is a good idea, Shannen.

31:55.420 --> 31:56.750
An intimacy coordinator.

31:56.790 --> 31:58.166
They're like, uh,
sex choreographers.

31:58.190 --> 32:00.320
They make sure
that boundaries are clear

32:00.360 --> 32:01.960
and everybody's comfortable
on set.

32:01.990 --> 32:03.790
I'll ask Jason,

32:03.830 --> 32:05.960
but I'm sure he won't listen
to me, like usual.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.460
Well, he needs to listen to us.

32:07.500 --> 32:08.900
I mean, I've told him five times

32:08.930 --> 32:10.800
I want Kyler's wardrobe changed.

32:10.830 --> 32:12.900
It's bad enough she has
one line in the show.

32:12.940 --> 32:15.240
I don't want her saying it
in a bikini.

32:15.270 --> 32:16.770
He had me waiting on set
for two hours

32:16.810 --> 32:18.310
for a scene
that we never even shot.

32:18.340 --> 32:20.240
I mean, could have saved, like,
five pit bulls

32:20.280 --> 32:21.986
- within that time period.
- Give him a break.

32:22.010 --> 32:23.186
He's having a hard time at home.

32:23.210 --> 32:24.286
He's got a lot of problems
going on.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.526
He's just trying to avoid them.

32:25.550 --> 32:27.920
Well, he needs to stop avoiding
and start listening.

32:27.950 --> 32:29.780
I'm not sure he's capable
of that right now.

32:29.820 --> 32:32.490
Well, he's gonna listen to me.

32:32.520 --> 32:33.490
Go get 'em, Jen.

32:33.520 --> 32:34.520
- I'm gonna.
- Yeah.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.690
- Mr. Director.
- Not now, Jennie.

32:36.730 --> 32:38.290
I don't have time for you.

32:38.330 --> 32:40.490
Don't call me that.

32:40.530 --> 32:41.500
It's your name.

32:41.530 --> 32:43.130
I don't like it when you say it.

32:43.170 --> 32:44.870
You have no idea

32:44.900 --> 32:47.270
- the amount of pressure I'm under.
- Here or at home?

32:47.300 --> 32:49.186
Don't you worry about
what's going on in my home.

32:49.210 --> 32:51.210
I will worry about it;
it's affecting me.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.510
Because you're a narcissist.

32:52.540 --> 32:53.980
I'm an actor.
We're all narcissists.

32:54.010 --> 32:55.340
It's not just me.

32:55.380 --> 32:56.686
It's the whole cast,
the whole crew.

32:56.710 --> 32:58.850
Everybody is feeling
your energy.

32:58.880 --> 33:00.056
So whatever
your little problem is,

33:00.080 --> 33:02.150
you need to fix it
and step it up.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.020
Fine.

33:05.050 --> 33:07.690
Great.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.520
I'm thinking
about leaving Camille.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.930
Okay, let's don't be dramatic.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.130
You are tired.

33:20.170 --> 33:22.140
It's been a stressful week.

33:22.170 --> 33:24.870
I just don't think I can raise
another man's kid.

33:25.910 --> 33:28.880
Even for you,
that sounds prehistoric.

33:28.910 --> 33:30.710
Mm, then I'm a caveman.

33:30.750 --> 33:32.910
You're not evolved enough
to be a caveman.

33:32.950 --> 33:35.350
That's funny.

33:35.390 --> 33:37.720
I like to make you laugh.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.720
Okay.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.230
Camille needs you.

33:45.260 --> 33:46.690
Get some sleep.

33:46.730 --> 33:48.730
Don't close my door.
Don't close my...

33:52.100 --> 33:53.600
- Amy...
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

33:53.640 --> 33:55.100
Could someone come
and open my door?

33:55.140 --> 33:56.600
<i>Right away.</i>

34:01.210 --> 34:03.180
Mr. Priestley.

34:03.210 --> 34:06.380
Dude, these are the small sides.
I need the big ones.

34:06.420 --> 34:08.719
I've told you that,
like, five times already.

34:08.750 --> 34:09.780
Jay, why don't you, uh...

34:09.820 --> 34:11.520
why don't you take it easy
on the kid?

34:11.550 --> 34:12.620
He's just learning.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.096
No, I need people here
who already know

34:14.120 --> 34:15.389
how to do their job, Brian.

34:15.429 --> 34:16.960
I understand that,

34:16.989 --> 34:19.230
but don't bring your
personal crap or your stress

34:19.260 --> 34:21.460
to, what, you know, there's...

34:22.600 --> 34:25.900
To people that are just trying
to do their job.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.969
Let's just get back to work.

34:30.770 --> 34:32.739
Don't worry about him.

34:32.780 --> 34:34.280
Thanks, Bri.

34:34.310 --> 34:35.840
You're welcome.

34:43.739 --> 34:44.746
- Hey, Jay.
- 20. Tori, hey.

34:44.770 --> 34:46.139
Look, I've made
some adjustments,

34:46.170 --> 34:48.110
but we really need to get
this scene shot today,

34:48.139 --> 34:49.216
so if you're having
any issues...

34:49.239 --> 34:51.040
No, actually, I don't,

34:51.080 --> 34:54.880
because I have hired
an intimacy coordinator.

34:54.909 --> 34:56.810
- A what?
- This is Melanie.

34:56.850 --> 34:59.280
She's gonna coach me
through the scene.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.420
Ah, Melanie.

35:01.450 --> 35:03.490
Just what I need,
another time suck.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.790
She's just gonna make me
feel confident and not rushed.

35:05.830 --> 35:08.230
Not rushed. Great.

35:08.260 --> 35:10.330
Hurry up and get in there.
Brian's waiting.

35:12.630 --> 35:14.530
<i>Scene 28, take two.</i>

35:17.140 --> 35:18.600
All right, you ready, guys?

35:18.640 --> 35:20.640
Here we go. And... action.

35:20.670 --> 35:24.510
Donna, you're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

35:24.540 --> 35:26.410
I love you, David.

35:26.450 --> 35:28.280
Excuse me?

35:29.480 --> 35:30.610
Yes, Melanie?

35:30.650 --> 35:33.120
It's just that
that's not the exact touching

35:33.150 --> 35:34.590
that you rehearsed.

35:34.620 --> 35:36.290
And I just want

35:36.320 --> 35:37.920
to make sure
that you feel comfortable.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.660
Yeah, I'm comfortable.

35:39.690 --> 35:42.260
With him brushing
against your breasts?

35:42.300 --> 35:44.830
Uh, well, Brian's an old friend,

35:44.860 --> 35:47.800
so he's brushed
against my breasts many times.

35:47.830 --> 35:50.840
Brian, are you comfortable
brushing against her breasts?

35:50.870 --> 35:52.140
Totally comfortable.

35:52.170 --> 35:53.370
Okay.

35:53.410 --> 35:54.616
Okay,
are we all comfortable now?

35:54.640 --> 35:56.970
Great. Okay,
let's go back to one.

35:57.010 --> 35:58.710
And... action.

36:00.150 --> 36:02.550
Donna, you're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

36:02.580 --> 36:04.010
Love you, David.

36:04.050 --> 36:05.350
- Excuse me.
- What now, Melanie?

36:05.380 --> 36:06.820
What now, Melanie?

36:06.850 --> 36:10.190
Tori,
you just don't look comfortable.

36:10.220 --> 36:11.820
I don't care
about looking comfortable.

36:11.860 --> 36:13.320
I want to look good.

36:13.360 --> 36:15.960
The two go hand in hand.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.830
Let's try something.

36:17.860 --> 36:19.300
Scene 28, take three.

36:19.330 --> 36:20.300
Here we go.

36:20.330 --> 36:22.530
And... action.

36:22.570 --> 36:25.200
Donna, you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

36:25.240 --> 36:27.670
I love you, David.

36:27.710 --> 36:30.070
You're doing so good. So good.

36:30.110 --> 36:32.580
I can't do this.
It's like <i> The Handmaid's Tale.</i>

36:32.610 --> 36:34.080
- And cut!
- Cutting!

36:34.110 --> 36:36.350
Well, I guess that's lunch.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.550
Yeah, come in.

36:41.590 --> 36:44.260
Hey, what's up?

36:44.290 --> 36:47.560
Jason is impossible.

36:47.590 --> 36:49.390
All he does is he gets me to do

36:49.430 --> 36:52.200
these unnecessary rewrites
when the network

36:52.230 --> 36:53.730
doesn't even give permission
to shoot

36:53.770 --> 36:56.200
because we can't afford the sets
or the locations.

36:57.700 --> 37:00.500
We haven't even filmed
a single thing today.

37:00.540 --> 37:03.240
God, he's like the epitome
of-of indulgence

37:03.280 --> 37:05.680
and-and arrogance
and incompetence.

37:05.710 --> 37:06.940
That's my boy.

37:06.980 --> 37:08.386
But do you really think
that it's his fault

37:08.410 --> 37:09.596
we haven't gotten
one shot off yet?

37:09.620 --> 37:11.880
- 100%.
- Nah.

37:11.920 --> 37:13.396
It's a little more complicated
than that.

37:13.420 --> 37:14.850
He's got some problems at home.

37:14.890 --> 37:16.530
Well, he should probably try
and fix them.

37:17.490 --> 37:19.220
It's not that easy.

37:19.260 --> 37:20.790
Uh, actually, it is.

37:20.830 --> 37:22.590
You face it,
and you deal with it.

37:22.630 --> 37:25.130
Oh, yeah? Talk to me
in 20 years about that.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.730
Maybe I will.

37:30.770 --> 37:33.300
I, um...

37:33.340 --> 37:35.840
weirdly like hanging out
with you.

37:36.910 --> 37:39.840
Well,
you'll probably get over it.

37:40.910 --> 37:42.780
Hope not.

37:50.990 --> 37:52.920
Was that okay?

37:52.960 --> 37:56.630
Yeah, that was okay.

37:56.660 --> 37:59.630
Um, before we go any further,

37:59.670 --> 38:01.470
one thing.

38:01.500 --> 38:02.670
What's that?

38:07.510 --> 38:10.310
We better sign
this consent form.

38:10.340 --> 38:12.110
Consent form?

38:12.140 --> 38:13.580
It's 2019.

38:13.610 --> 38:14.980
<i>2019</i>

38:15.010 --> 38:16.750
is such a trip.

38:16.780 --> 38:18.420
Have any of you
ever been asked to sign

38:18.450 --> 38:20.620
- a love contract?
- Yes. I got married.

38:20.650 --> 38:22.490
No, no, this is a consent form

38:22.520 --> 38:24.520
to date someone you're
working with. It's insane.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.190
Apparently, it's a thing now.

38:26.230 --> 38:27.460
Wait, is it a thing?

38:27.490 --> 38:29.490
D-Do I need to sign one
with Wyatt?

38:29.530 --> 38:31.930
- It's a thing.
- It actually is a thing,

38:31.960 --> 38:34.030
and I was just asked
to sign one.

38:34.070 --> 38:35.206
- You had to sign one?
- Wait.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.200
- What?
- With who? Who is he?

38:40.170 --> 38:42.170
It's not a he.

38:43.910 --> 38:45.310
What?

38:45.340 --> 38:48.010
She asked me to disclose it

38:48.050 --> 38:50.050
in a legal document,
and, you-you guys,

38:50.080 --> 38:52.550
it's not fair.
I haven't even told anybody yet.

38:52.590 --> 38:54.390
- You're gay.
- Tell anybody what?

38:54.420 --> 38:56.236
- She's gay. She just told us.
- So you're gay.

38:56.260 --> 38:57.796
- She just said she's...
- Oh, no, not gay.

38:57.820 --> 38:58.866
Not bi.
I have no idea what I am,

38:58.890 --> 39:00.320
and as of now,

39:00.360 --> 39:02.230
I am coming out undeclared
to you.

39:03.260 --> 39:05.500
Gab, I think
that's really brave.

39:05.530 --> 39:06.960
Thank you.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.470
Very, uh, inspirational.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.730
You know what I think?

39:10.770 --> 39:12.470
I think I want to come out, too.

39:12.510 --> 39:14.070
Thank God. Now it makes sense.

39:14.110 --> 39:16.210
That's why you're uncomfortable
during the sex scene.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.210
- I thought it was me.
- Zach.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.480
I would like to introduce, uh,

39:22.520 --> 39:25.320
for the first time
to everyone, Zach...

39:25.350 --> 39:26.420
my son.

39:30.560 --> 39:31.990
Are you sure?

39:32.020 --> 39:34.120
Yeah, I'm sure.

39:38.430 --> 39:40.030
Zach,

39:40.070 --> 39:43.600
you are very lucky
to have Brian as your father.

39:43.640 --> 39:46.240
Welcome to the family.

39:46.270 --> 39:47.540
Thanks, Tor.

39:49.310 --> 39:51.710
All right,
you guys want to go shoot this?

39:51.740 --> 39:54.410
Let's do it.

39:54.450 --> 39:55.680
All right, you ready, guys?

39:55.720 --> 39:57.280
Let's try this one more time.

39:57.320 --> 39:59.020
Action.

39:59.050 --> 40:01.550
Donna, you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

40:01.590 --> 40:03.720
I love you, David.

40:13.570 --> 40:15.570
Ooh.

40:17.140 --> 40:20.070
I am so sorry.

40:21.110 --> 40:23.110
No problem.

40:24.940 --> 40:26.310
- And let's cut it!
- Cutting!

40:26.350 --> 40:27.910
All right. That's great.

40:27.950 --> 40:29.326
Ladies and gentlemen,
we just completed

40:29.350 --> 40:31.950
our first scene
of the new <i> 90210.</i>

40:31.980 --> 40:34.550
Not a moment too soon. 46 more,

40:34.590 --> 40:36.590
we got ourselves
a complete show.

40:36.620 --> 40:38.790
Next things next,
what are we gonna do now?

40:38.820 --> 40:39.960
Let's get moving.

40:39.990 --> 40:41.960
Okay? Let's, uh, open up
the elephant doors.

40:41.990 --> 40:44.076
We're gonna bring in the Supertechno crane.
You mean the high shot?

40:44.100 --> 40:45.506
We're gonna...
That's a very good question.

40:45.530 --> 40:46.946
We're gonna do a shot
through the door

40:46.970 --> 40:48.570
- that's starting in there...
- Camille?

40:48.600 --> 40:50.416
- Are you okay? I'll get him.
- Scene 12 over here...

40:50.440 --> 40:51.600
- Hey, Jay.
- Yeah.

40:51.640 --> 40:52.986
- I don't have time, Jen.
- Jay, you need to take this.

40:53.010 --> 40:54.746
- Yeah, not now, Jennie.
- No, you need to take this call.

40:54.770 --> 40:56.116
It's Camille.
She's in an ambulance.

40:56.140 --> 40:57.110
What?

40:57.140 --> 40:58.640
Camille?

40:59.680 --> 41:01.750
Yeah. Honey,
I'll be right there.

41:01.780 --> 41:03.150
Yeah. Okay, I'm on my way.

41:04.150 --> 41:05.650
Is he leaving?

41:05.680 --> 41:07.150
Yeah, he is.

41:07.190 --> 41:09.120
How about a drive

41:09.160 --> 41:10.850
out to the beach
for a nice dinner?

41:10.890 --> 41:12.890
I'd like that.

41:18.860 --> 41:20.830
Night, ladies.

41:23.500 --> 41:24.700
Night.

41:24.740 --> 41:26.070
Good night.

41:27.070 --> 41:28.970
I'm sorry, I don't...

41:29.010 --> 41:30.710
Are you a part of the crew?

41:33.150 --> 41:35.880
- Oh, you're here to investigate the fire.
- Just wrapping up.

41:35.920 --> 41:38.380
- Okay, well, good night.
- Night.

41:38.420 --> 41:40.150
Yeah, today's actually
my first day.

41:40.190 --> 41:42.190
Really?

41:44.690 --> 41:46.560
Hey, what time's call tomorrow?
