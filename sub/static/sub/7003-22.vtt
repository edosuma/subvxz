WEBVTT

00:02.868 --> 00:05.136
What are you doing?

00:05.137 --> 00:07.973
Oh, I'm doing research
for a magazine article.
It's about finland.

00:07.974 --> 00:09.941
Look at this.
Isn't that gorgeous?

00:09.942 --> 00:13.712
Oh, yeah.
I'm a huge finn fan.

00:15.414 --> 00:19.684
Especially those fine
feminine finns in that hot tub.

00:21.253 --> 00:23.254
Hot tubs are really
popular there.

00:23.255 --> 00:25.256
But when they get out,

00:25.257 --> 00:30.595
They beat themselves gently
with leafy birch branches.

00:30.596 --> 00:34.265
Well, we've got
that whirlpool upstairs.

00:36.068 --> 00:40.105
Next time you get out,
I can snap you with a wet towel.

00:40.106 --> 00:42.807
But this is
a little more romantic.

00:42.808 --> 00:45.176
See? They're outside
under the stars.

00:45.177 --> 00:47.378
Can you imagine you and me
in a hot tub,

00:47.379 --> 00:50.248
Staring up at the moon?
It'd be great.

00:50.249 --> 00:51.983
Especially with
a couple of those finnish girls,

00:51.984 --> 00:54.285
Yorgie and pecka.

00:58.958 --> 01:01.259
Nice hit.
Guys, over here.

01:01.260 --> 01:03.795
I think I figured out what
to get mom for mother's day.

01:03.796 --> 01:06.131
She told you?
No, she dropped
a few hints, though.

01:06.132 --> 01:07.198
So what does she want?

01:07.199 --> 01:08.533
She wants to
go to finland.

01:08.534 --> 01:10.869
They got this real big deal
with midnight hot tubs.

01:10.870 --> 01:14.172
When they get out,
they get spanked by trees.

01:14.173 --> 01:17.676
Cool! Let's all go!

01:17.677 --> 01:20.011
So we're gonna
send mom to finland?

01:20.012 --> 01:23.281
No, no, no. We can bring
finland to mom.

01:23.282 --> 01:26.417
I say we put in
a hot tub.
Yeah! Cool!

01:26.418 --> 01:29.054
We'll put it right over here,
get rid of the swing set.

01:29.055 --> 01:30.354
You guys don't use this
anymore, do you?

01:30.355 --> 01:33.725
Yeah, we do. Last week
we tied mark to it.

02:43.929 --> 02:45.930
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

02:53.839 --> 02:56.074
Welcome to <i>tool</i> <i>time.</i>
I am tim "the tool man" taylor.

02:56.075 --> 02:58.576
You all know my assistant,
al borland.

02:58.577 --> 03:00.011
There's a lot of stereotypes

03:00.012 --> 03:01.846
About construction workers
today.

03:01.847 --> 03:04.182
But the times,
they are a-changing.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.817
<i>(imitates harmonica)</i>

03:05.818 --> 03:08.286
And today, to talk about
some of these changes,

03:08.287 --> 03:10.621
One of our friends from
k & b construction company

03:10.622 --> 03:12.991
In bay city, michigan. Let's
give a big <i>tool time</i> welcome

03:12.992 --> 03:14.625
For pete bilker!

03:17.729 --> 03:20.464
<i>(whooping and cheering)</i>

03:23.169 --> 03:25.069
Pete, it's good to
have you with us again.

03:25.070 --> 03:27.338
And it's great
to be here, timmy!

03:27.339 --> 03:28.372
Pete.
Hey, al.

03:28.373 --> 03:30.041
Nice to see you.
All right.

03:30.042 --> 03:31.976
Pete, have a seat,
will you?

03:34.579 --> 03:36.948
Pete, do you consider
yourself a...

03:36.949 --> 03:39.117
Oh, I don't know,
a construction worker
of the '90s?

03:39.118 --> 03:43.922
Well, tim, nowadays when
a hot rivet drops down
in my shirt,

03:45.490 --> 03:48.659
I'm not ashamed to cry.

03:48.660 --> 03:52.496
Something you should remember,
al, next time I drop a hot rivet
down your shirt, huh?

03:54.166 --> 03:56.334
The most common stereotypes
about construction workers

03:56.335 --> 03:59.670
Is their hootin' and hollerin'
at every pretty woman
that passes by.

03:59.671 --> 04:03.007
That's pretty much
a thing of the past, tim,
especially at k & b.

04:03.008 --> 04:06.010
Our new foreman, les, doesn't
go for that kind of stuff.

04:06.011 --> 04:09.013
Maybe one of these days we
should get les down here
to talk about it.

04:09.014 --> 04:13.284
Actually, tim, since we are
discussing changing attitudes
on the job site,

04:13.285 --> 04:16.519
I brought my new foreman
with me. Would you like to
meet les?

04:16.521 --> 04:19.023
Yeah! Let's bring him
down here.

04:34.473 --> 04:38.542
<i>(laughs)</i> you're the foreman?
Uh-huh.

04:38.543 --> 04:40.378
You're a woman.
<i>(guffaws)</i>

04:40.379 --> 04:42.613
Can't put anything
past you.

04:43.983 --> 04:45.950
Please, sit down.
Take a seat.

04:45.951 --> 04:48.920
Well! A woman foreman.

04:48.921 --> 04:53.224
It must be kinda hard gettin'
the guys at the construction
site to listen to you.

04:53.225 --> 04:55.526
Why would it be hard?

05:01.100 --> 05:02.700
<i>(nervous laugh)</i>

05:02.701 --> 05:05.503
Some guys have trouble
taking orders from women.

05:07.606 --> 05:11.876
Not me, 'cause I take orders
from my wife all the time.

05:11.877 --> 05:14.512
Huh. Well, it hasn't
been a problem. I mean,

05:14.513 --> 05:18.016
I've been working with the guys
for a while now and they realize
I know what I'm doing.

05:18.017 --> 05:22.853
Tim, I must tell you that
les is probably the best
overall worker we have.

05:22.854 --> 05:25.823
The best-looking worker
in overalls, too.

05:28.493 --> 05:33.298
Nope, that would be pete.
Aw, heck!

05:36.802 --> 05:40.871
Anyway, timmy, there's no one
more qualified than les,

05:40.872 --> 05:44.943
And no one knows more
about tools than les.

05:44.944 --> 05:48.112
No one?

05:48.113 --> 05:50.815
You heard him, tim.

05:50.816 --> 05:54.618
Oh, yeah? Then why does
everybody call me
"the tool man"?

05:54.619 --> 05:58.722
Because it's your show
and you made up the name?

05:58.723 --> 06:01.159
I like her.

06:02.761 --> 06:07.999
I'd be willing to stake my tool
reputation against anyone.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.002
Well, how about me?

06:11.003 --> 06:14.339
Les. Leslie. I wouldn't
want to embarrass you.

06:14.340 --> 06:17.008
Anybody who challenges me,
it always ends up the same way.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.444
You lose?

06:20.980 --> 06:24.248
I love her!

06:30.990 --> 06:32.857
All right. Got electric in,

06:32.858 --> 06:36.494
You guys got the holes filled
in, we're ready for the hot tub.

06:36.495 --> 06:39.530
Where is it?
Al's supposed to
be delivering it.

06:39.531 --> 06:43.501
Well, shouldn't you help him?
That thing's pretty heavy.

06:43.502 --> 06:47.338
He's got his mom
with him.

06:47.339 --> 06:50.808
Dad, here comes mom!
No, no, no!

06:52.611 --> 06:54.812
Hey, guys,
it's really late.

06:54.813 --> 06:56.714
What are you doing
out here?

07:01.387 --> 07:04.889
We all have problems. We're
waitin' for wilson to wake up.

07:09.461 --> 07:12.130
Come on, boys. It's midnight.
Go on to bed.

07:12.131 --> 07:16.334
Thanks, guys.
Wash your hands, ok?
Wash up. Brush your teeth.

07:16.335 --> 07:18.769
Good night, sweetie.
Good night.

07:21.606 --> 07:24.042
I'll bet I know
what you're doing out here.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.743
Oh, do you?

07:25.744 --> 07:27.878
Well, let's see.

07:27.879 --> 07:29.547
You're out here in
the middle of the night,

07:29.548 --> 07:31.582
Carrying shovels,
covered in dirt.

07:31.583 --> 07:36.620
I didn't want to tell you,
but wilson wasn't feeling well
so we buried him.

07:36.621 --> 07:41.325
Could you possibly be working
on my mother's day gift?

07:41.326 --> 07:43.627
Possibly.
Ohhh...!

07:43.628 --> 07:46.464
Thank you for listening to all
those hints I've been dropping.

07:46.465 --> 07:49.833
I'm just gonna love
my new herb garden.
Your what garden?

07:49.834 --> 07:54.205
Well, I've always wanted
to grow my own basil.
It's gonna be great.

07:54.206 --> 07:57.908
It's a good thing I built you
an herb garden and didn't buy
you a hot tub.

07:57.909 --> 08:00.278
Well, yeah. What would
I need with a hot tub?

08:00.279 --> 08:02.046
I've got a whirlpool
upstairs.

08:02.047 --> 08:03.847
That's where I'm gonna put your
herb garden, right here.

08:03.848 --> 08:06.284
Where did you move
the swing set?

08:06.285 --> 08:09.387
I gave it to pete bilker,
one of the guys from
k & b construction.

08:09.388 --> 08:10.388
It's for his little boy.

08:10.389 --> 08:13.257
Were the boys
ok with that?

08:13.258 --> 08:16.961
Yeah. They don't use it anymore,
except for tying mark up.

08:16.962 --> 08:18.963
Yeah, I know.
It's just...

08:18.964 --> 08:23.401
It looks so strange
out here without it.

08:23.402 --> 08:28.172
I mean, you built that thing...
Well, when brad was a baby.

08:28.173 --> 08:31.242
Now you can raise basil.

08:31.243 --> 08:35.480
Remember how much fun they had
playing on it when they were
really little?

08:35.481 --> 08:40.351
How we marked their heights
every year, everyone's,
on that wooden post?

08:40.352 --> 08:42.285
I was always the tallest.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.159
I will never forget

08:48.160 --> 08:52.663
How hard it was for randy
to learn to swing on his own

08:52.664 --> 08:56.534
And how happy he was
when he finally got it.

08:58.203 --> 09:00.638
Jill, are you upset
that I gave the swing set away?

09:02.073 --> 09:06.076
No! No, no. I'll get used to it.
Herbs are fun.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.814
You know, it's...
Gosh, it's chilly out here.

09:10.815 --> 09:13.984
I'm gonna go up to bed.
I'll see you later.
Good night.

09:16.255 --> 09:18.189
<i>(door closes)</i>

09:19.724 --> 09:21.659
<i>(maracas rattling)</i>

09:27.499 --> 09:29.233
Wilson, what are you doing?

09:29.234 --> 09:33.304
Hi-ho, tim. I'm just
testing my maracas.

09:33.305 --> 09:36.174
Usually when I have mine tested,
the doctor makes me turn my head
and cough.

09:44.082 --> 09:48.886
No, no, tim. These are
hand-carved maracas made
from hollowed-out gourds.

09:48.887 --> 09:54.091
I'm using them to practice
the national dance of venezuela,
the joropo.

09:54.092 --> 09:56.527
At midnight?

09:56.528 --> 09:59.797
Is it really that late?

09:59.798 --> 10:03.067
Well, it just shows you -
time flies when you're
dancing the joropo.

10:05.036 --> 10:07.405
Could you keep it down?

10:07.406 --> 10:10.941
Tim, have you got a problem?

10:10.942 --> 10:13.477
I'm just mad at myself.

10:13.478 --> 10:17.315
I thought I had the perfect
mother's day gift for jill,
but I don't.

10:17.316 --> 10:22.119
Now I got a flatbed truck
comin' over with al and his mom
with a hot tub on it.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.423
But the worst thing is,
I gave away the swing set,

10:25.424 --> 10:29.159
And it looks like
it meant a lot to jill.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.597
I remember when you built
that swing set, tim.

10:32.598 --> 10:35.566
It was 14 years ago.
You'd just moved in.

10:35.567 --> 10:40.338
I'd never seen anyone
attach an outboard motor
to a swing before.

10:43.208 --> 10:46.711
That swing set was the first
thing I made for my boys.
You know?

10:46.712 --> 10:48.713
I picked out the best
redwood for that.

10:48.714 --> 10:51.181
I had six coats of sealer
on there.

10:51.182 --> 10:53.484
I worked night and day
on that thing.

10:53.485 --> 10:55.886
Sounds like it meant
an awful lot to you too, tim.

10:55.887 --> 10:58.522
Yeah. I remember the day
brad was born.

10:58.523 --> 11:02.192
I had the swing set
all set up so he could
use it when he got home.

11:02.193 --> 11:05.496
Babies - who knew
they couldn't sit up?

11:06.898 --> 11:09.400
Psst! Tim!

11:09.401 --> 11:11.201
Is the coast clear?

11:11.202 --> 11:14.071
Mother and I have the hot tub
off the flatbed.

11:14.072 --> 11:15.939
The hot tub is out.

11:15.940 --> 11:19.843
Tell your mom to hoist it
back up there.

11:19.844 --> 11:21.879
Oh, man!

11:27.653 --> 11:32.022
Dad, how come you're trying
to get the swing set back?

11:32.023 --> 11:34.258
Because that's what your mom
wants for mother's day.

11:34.259 --> 11:36.126
I thought she
wanted an herb garden.

11:36.127 --> 11:38.329
I thought she
wanted a hot tub.

11:38.330 --> 11:42.400
I thought she wanted
to go to finland.

11:42.401 --> 11:46.404
I thought she wanted me
to snap her with a wet towel.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.872
I'll save that
for her birthday.

11:48.873 --> 11:50.107
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

11:50.108 --> 11:51.676
Hey, dad, isn't pete
gonna be upset

11:51.677 --> 11:53.477
When you ask him
for the swing set back?

11:53.478 --> 11:56.880
He'll understand.
He's an adult.

12:01.753 --> 12:04.689
Hey, pete! Come on in.
Hey, timmy. How are you?

12:04.690 --> 12:08.025
I'd like you
to meet little pete.

12:08.026 --> 12:09.993
Hi, little pete.
How you doin'?
Hi.

12:09.994 --> 12:13.464
I brought him with me today
because he has something
he wants to tell you.

12:13.465 --> 12:16.266
Thank you for my swing set,
mr. Tool man.

12:16.267 --> 12:18.235
Oh.

12:19.538 --> 12:21.739
<i>(nervous chuckle)</i>

12:21.740 --> 12:24.475
Uh... Come on in, you guys.
You want a cookie or somethin'?

12:24.476 --> 12:27.177
Thank you,
mr. Tool man.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.481
You're in luck.
My favorite -
chocolate chip.

12:30.482 --> 12:33.116
Help yourself. Put some
on the table over there.

12:33.117 --> 12:35.018
Pete, can I talk to you
for a minute?

12:35.019 --> 12:37.154
You bet, tim.
But before you do,

12:37.155 --> 12:39.457
I wanna tell you,

12:39.458 --> 12:43.361
That swing set has made
little pete real happy.

12:46.197 --> 12:49.199
Well, looks like anything
would make him happy.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.801
He's a happy-go-lucky kid.

12:50.802 --> 12:53.170
No, tim. He's neither
happy nor lucky.

12:53.171 --> 12:56.240
You know, he's had a pretty
rough go of it this past year,

12:56.241 --> 12:59.343
What with his mother
leaving and all.

12:59.344 --> 13:01.645
I should've
seen it comin' -

13:01.646 --> 13:07.418
Goin' to the grocery store
with nine pieces of luggage
in the car.

13:07.419 --> 13:10.087
These are great cookies,
mr. Tool man.

13:10.088 --> 13:12.890
Can I take some for when
I'm playing on my swing set?

13:16.227 --> 13:19.897
Little pete,
about that swing set.

13:19.898 --> 13:21.565
Yes, mr. Tool man?

13:21.566 --> 13:25.335
How... How would you feel
if I took that old one back?

13:25.336 --> 13:29.172
It has a lot of splinters
in it - and built you
a brand-new one?

13:29.173 --> 13:30.941
Now, tim, that's
not really necessary.

13:30.942 --> 13:34.478
Oh, yes, it is.

13:34.479 --> 13:38.416
Is it gonna have
a teeter-totter?
You bet.

13:38.417 --> 13:41.118
Is it gonna have a sandbox?

13:41.119 --> 13:43.454
Yeah. A huge sandbox!

13:43.455 --> 13:45.423
Is it gonna have
a tree house?

13:45.424 --> 13:48.358
A what?
A tree house?

13:48.359 --> 13:50.561
Swing sets don't have
tree houses.

13:50.562 --> 13:53.431
They have one at the park.
Why not?

13:53.432 --> 13:54.832
We'll put a tree house
on it for you, too.

13:54.833 --> 13:57.301
Thank you, tim.
You bet, buddy.

13:57.302 --> 14:02.406
Mr. Tool man, can you come to
my school for show and tell?

14:06.711 --> 14:10.314
Welcome back to <i>tool</i> <i>time.</i>
We have a very special
competition comin' up.

14:10.315 --> 14:13.150
You've heard of the rose bowl.
Well, put away your flowers!

14:13.151 --> 14:17.721
Plug in your tools,
'cause we got... The tool bowl!

14:19.324 --> 14:22.960
I will be serving as moderator
and impartial judge.

14:22.961 --> 14:29.099
This will be simulcast on
al's favorite station,
the all-flannel channel.

14:31.837 --> 14:36.707
As impartial as I am,
remarks like that
could affect the judging.

14:36.708 --> 14:38.709
All right, let's meet
the competition.

14:38.710 --> 14:41.645
The reigning tool champion
of the universe: Me.

14:41.646 --> 14:44.715
And the challenger:
The new foreman for
the k & b construction company.

14:44.716 --> 14:48.519
Let's give a big <i>tool time</i>
welcome for les thompson.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.920
<i>(cheering and whooping)</i>

14:51.756 --> 14:53.791
How's it goin' today,
les?
Just great.

14:53.792 --> 14:57.461
Listen, I'd like to invite
you both to a little party
I'm having after the show

14:57.462 --> 15:00.030
To celebrate my...
Upcoming victory.

15:00.031 --> 15:02.032
<i>(snorts)</i>

15:02.033 --> 15:04.802
I'd be careful
saying stuff like that.

15:04.803 --> 15:07.070
I might just nail it up on
the board for inspiration.

15:07.071 --> 15:09.239
I've seen your show, tim,
and if you want it to stay up,

15:09.240 --> 15:11.876
Maybe you'd better
have al nail it.

15:11.877 --> 15:14.177
<i>(audience boos)</i>

15:15.480 --> 15:17.815
Did I mention just how much
I liked her?

15:17.816 --> 15:20.551
All right.
Let's get to it.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.720
Les, since you are
the challenger,

15:22.721 --> 15:25.723
You have the first choice
of categories.

15:25.724 --> 15:28.993
I'll take "epoxy putties
and liquid metals."

15:28.994 --> 15:30.728
<i>(musical tone)</i>

15:30.729 --> 15:32.830
Excellent choice.

15:32.831 --> 15:35.465
Heidi?

15:35.466 --> 15:37.367
Thank you, heidi.
You're welcome.

15:37.368 --> 15:42.606
"to repair a hydraulic ram,
what type of epoxy putty
would you use, and why?"

15:44.943 --> 15:49.547
I'd go with titanium, since
it resists temperatures
of 350° fahrenheit

15:49.548 --> 15:52.583
And has a compression
strength of 18,000 psi.

15:52.584 --> 15:55.519
It also provides a nonrusting,
machinable finish,

15:55.520 --> 15:59.056
And features excellent
resistance to a broad range
of chemicals.

16:08.332 --> 16:11.735
Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm.

16:11.736 --> 16:14.939
It was an easy question,
all right?

16:14.940 --> 16:19.543
All right, tim.
Your question.
Heidi? Thank you.

16:19.544 --> 16:25.148
"in a nonrusting aluminum epoxy,
what are the percentages of
aluminum and epoxy?"

16:25.149 --> 16:28.686
Easy. Everyone knows that.
70% aluminum, 30% epoxy.

16:28.687 --> 16:32.489
Actually, that's
80% aluminum and 20% epoxy.

16:32.490 --> 16:34.992
70%, 80%.
What's the difference?

16:34.993 --> 16:36.694
One is right
and one is wrong.

16:39.397 --> 16:41.799
All right.
Round one goes to...

16:41.800 --> 16:44.868
<i>(♪ fanfare)</i>
les.

16:44.869 --> 16:46.971
Yes!
<i>(applause)</i>

16:46.972 --> 16:50.574
By the way, what type of
food are you going to have
at your victory party?

16:50.575 --> 16:53.077
Buffalo wings
and three kinds
of dipping sauces.

16:53.078 --> 16:56.780
Buffalo wings?
Ladies?
Ladies, could we...?

16:59.417 --> 17:03.453
All right. Our next category -
"you auto know."

17:03.454 --> 17:05.422
All right.

17:06.691 --> 17:08.759
Les, your question is,

17:08.760 --> 17:13.497
"you're building a '79 pontiac
with a 151-cubic-inch,
four-cylinder engine

17:13.498 --> 17:16.066
"and you want to run
roller tip rockers.

17:16.067 --> 17:18.102
"are the 151 rockers
interchangeable with

17:18.103 --> 17:20.569
The stock rockers on
a small-block chevy?"

17:20.570 --> 17:23.339
That's a really
tough question.

17:23.340 --> 17:26.609
<i>(effeminately)</i> well, if it's
too tough for you, ms. Buffalo
wings and three sauces...

17:26.611 --> 17:29.479
I can take that one.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.782
Luckily I know more
about cars than tools.

17:31.783 --> 17:33.416
Really?

17:33.417 --> 17:36.453
No, they're not
interchangeable.

17:36.454 --> 17:40.724
The 151 rocker arm
fulcrum-to-tip distance is
greater than a small-block's,

17:40.725 --> 17:44.161
So it can't be used if you want
to maintain acceptable valve
train geometry.

17:44.162 --> 17:45.162
<i>(bell pings)</i>

17:45.163 --> 17:46.196
<i>(cheering)</i>

17:48.599 --> 17:53.170
I'll also be having a cappuccino
bar and assorted sorbets.

17:55.239 --> 17:57.507
All right, tim,
this is your question.

17:57.508 --> 18:00.177
Let's forget the rest of
the questions and go right
to the bonus round.

18:00.178 --> 18:02.345
What bonus round?

18:02.346 --> 18:06.416
Winner take all.
Heidi, the bonus board, please.

18:06.417 --> 18:07.685
And what is that?

18:07.686 --> 18:11.155
It's the tool bowl
super bonus screw-off.

18:11.156 --> 18:14.357
First person to screw those
screws in takes the whole thing.

18:14.358 --> 18:16.994
I'm game.
Great.

18:16.995 --> 18:19.163
Heidi, my electric screwdrivers,
please.

18:19.164 --> 18:23.133
Here you are.
Pick your weapon.

18:23.134 --> 18:25.769
Ooh, nice grip.
All right.

18:27.371 --> 18:29.873
I'll just pick mine.
Let's see.

18:29.874 --> 18:32.810
No, no. I'll just take
this one down here.

18:32.811 --> 18:34.411
All right.

18:34.412 --> 18:38.348
Your electric screwdriver
has a gas engine?

18:41.186 --> 18:43.087
Got a problem
with that, fella?

18:43.088 --> 18:45.022
Ok, go.

18:48.927 --> 18:53.197
<i>(powerful motor sound)</i>

19:08.847 --> 19:11.215
I'm done! I won!

19:11.216 --> 19:17.721
All right! The champion
and new tool world record
holder!

19:22.693 --> 19:24.694
Come on. You're gonna
love this.

19:24.695 --> 19:27.064
Honey, it is 6:00
in the morning.

19:27.065 --> 19:29.699
I was really kind of hoping
that I could sleep late
on mother's day.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.602
Well, I just finished
your gift and I couldn't
wait to show it to you.

19:32.603 --> 19:33.637
Ok.

19:35.140 --> 19:38.075
Oh, my gosh!

19:38.076 --> 19:42.813
This is beautiful!

19:42.814 --> 19:46.683
Wait a minute! You said you were
gonna make me an herb garden.

19:46.684 --> 19:50.520
Look around. I had the boys
plant something special for you.

19:50.521 --> 19:52.122
Basil!

19:52.123 --> 19:57.494
Basil, basil...
And more basil.

19:57.495 --> 20:01.932
Well, I knew it was your
favorite because I read
between the lines.

20:01.933 --> 20:06.303
Tim, I told you
that I liked basil.

20:06.304 --> 20:09.339
Which is how I'm able
to read between the lines.

20:10.441 --> 20:13.844
Sit down.
Oh. All right.

20:17.548 --> 20:20.784
Wow! This is really
comfortable.

20:20.785 --> 20:26.790
Oh, honey, this is
the best mother's day ever.

20:29.327 --> 20:34.364
And there's still
so much of it left.

20:34.365 --> 20:36.133
Don't go to sleep.

20:36.134 --> 20:37.500
What's this over here?

20:39.603 --> 20:41.138
Those are randy's initials.

20:41.139 --> 20:42.772
Mm-hm.

20:42.773 --> 20:44.774
And right back here
are their measurements.

20:44.775 --> 20:48.478
You made this out of
the old swing set!

20:48.479 --> 20:51.114
What a great idea!

20:51.115 --> 20:55.452
But I thought that you said
that you gave it to little pete,
pete's son.

20:55.453 --> 20:58.621
I took it back.

20:58.622 --> 21:00.824
Hope you gave him
something else.

21:00.825 --> 21:02.926
Don't worry about that kid.
By the time he's done with me,

21:02.927 --> 21:05.863
I'll have an amusement park
built in his backyard.

21:09.267 --> 21:12.836
I can't believe you did this.
You are so brilliant.

21:12.837 --> 21:16.406
Well, I saw how upset you were
when I gave away the swing set.

21:16.407 --> 21:19.910
I guess that seemed
kind of silly, huh?
No.

21:19.911 --> 21:23.947
I have a lot of memories
locked up in this too, you know.

21:23.948 --> 21:26.917
Time goes by so fast.
Yeah.

21:33.324 --> 21:36.659
Here's something I don't ever
remember seeing before.

21:36.660 --> 21:39.363
"tim loves jill."
when did you do that?

21:39.364 --> 21:42.199
About 3:30 this morning.

21:43.467 --> 21:46.103
Happy mother's day.

21:55.013 --> 21:57.147
Here you go, mom.

21:57.148 --> 21:59.649
Basil omelet.
Happy mother's day.

21:59.650 --> 22:03.420
That's so sweet of you, honey.
Looks delicious.

22:03.421 --> 22:05.355
And mom,

22:05.356 --> 22:08.158
Don't forget your basil
butter with your toast.

22:08.159 --> 22:12.229
Basil butter.
Well, that's original.

22:12.230 --> 22:13.931
If you think
that's original,

22:13.932 --> 22:18.168
Wait till you taste
your fresh-squeezed
basil juice.

22:20.138 --> 22:21.471
We also made you coffee.

22:21.472 --> 22:23.773
Is it green?

22:25.243 --> 22:29.813
And for dessert,
fresh-baked basil cream pie.

22:32.650 --> 22:34.985
I should've said
I like diamonds.

22:40.959 --> 22:44.127
Looks like anything would make
him happy. Happy-go-lucky kid.

22:44.128 --> 22:45.662
No, pete, he's neither...

22:45.663 --> 22:49.466
You're not pete, are you?
No.

22:49.467 --> 22:51.068
I'm pete.
You'd be pete.

22:51.069 --> 22:53.236
You'd be tim.
I'd be tim.

22:53.237 --> 22:56.006
...And has a compression
strength of 18,000 psi

22:56.007 --> 22:58.108
It also provides
a nonrustable...

22:58.109 --> 23:01.011
Machinable finish and...

23:01.012 --> 23:02.980
I'm going to
have to start over.

23:08.486 --> 23:11.621
Psst! Hey, tim!
Is the coast clear?

23:11.622 --> 23:15.959
Mom and I have the hot tub
off the hot bed. <i>(laughs)</i>

23:17.428 --> 23:20.430
<i>(men)</i> kill him! Kill him!

23:23.567 --> 23:28.138
One line! One!
