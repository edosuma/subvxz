WEBVTT

00:00.728 --> 00:02.078
My name is Talon.

00:02.121 --> 00:03.881
I'm the last Blackblood,
or so I've been told.

00:03.905 --> 00:06.734
I escaped when Everit Dred
killed all my people.

00:06.778 --> 00:09.737
I cut off the points of my
ears to hide in plain sight.

00:09.781 --> 00:11.870
A tiny creature lives inside me,

00:11.913 --> 00:13.785
passed to me by my dying mother.

00:13.828 --> 00:16.614
It gives me the power to
open portals to another world

00:16.657 --> 00:19.138
and summon powerful demons
called Lu-Qiri.

00:19.182 --> 00:21.532
But I can only summon them
when I have their names,

00:21.575 --> 00:23.249
something that's proving
to be a challenge.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.492
The Prime Order wants me dead,

00:25.536 --> 00:27.731
but I've found sanctuary at
the farthest edge of the Realm

00:27.755 --> 00:30.149
in a place known as the Outpost.

00:30.935 --> 00:32.806
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:32.850 --> 00:34.547
I'm Captain Garret Spears.

00:34.590 --> 00:36.830
I don't really think you could
last a few rounds with me.

00:39.204 --> 00:41.684
Gwynn.

00:41.728 --> 00:43.730
Hail to the Queen!

00:43.773 --> 00:45.514
Hail to the Queen!

00:45.558 --> 00:48.778
I, Gate Marshal Cedric Wythers,
acting magistrate.

00:48.822 --> 00:50.432
Marshal Wythers is your father?

00:50.476 --> 00:53.522
The name's Janzo,
best brewer in the Realm.

00:53.566 --> 00:56.177
If you have colipsum
in your blood, fly eggs,

00:56.221 --> 00:58.179
and you're injected
by a Plagueling,

00:58.223 --> 00:59.964
they grow into a parasite.

01:00.007 --> 01:03.619
This is the Vex Rezicon,
the Book of Names.

01:03.663 --> 01:06.013
Only the Dragman can understand.

01:06.057 --> 01:07.885
I'm the Dragman.

01:07.928 --> 01:10.148
Your word you'll free my family?

01:10.191 --> 01:11.801
You have my word.

01:11.845 --> 01:14.108
I'm putting together a team
to go after Dred.

01:14.152 --> 01:15.805
I hope you find him.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.641 --> 01:26.642
Ooh.

01:45.879 --> 01:47.925
The tracks lead up
through the ruins.

01:49.709 --> 01:52.320
What is this place?

01:52.364 --> 01:54.148
It used to be Dun-ebdin.

01:56.585 --> 01:58.805
When the Prime Order
overthrew the royals,

01:58.848 --> 02:01.199
Lord Ebdin refused
to swear fealty.

02:01.242 --> 02:04.115
They smashed down his gates,

02:04.158 --> 02:06.160
burnt his castle...

02:08.119 --> 02:09.598
killed everyone,

02:09.642 --> 02:13.037
including Lord Ebdin himself.

02:18.868 --> 02:21.436
Are they gonna do
the same thing to us?

02:21.480 --> 02:24.178
That is why we cannot
let Dred reach the capital.

02:24.222 --> 02:26.398
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

02:26.441 --> 02:27.573
Good.

02:27.616 --> 02:29.227
- Hyah.

02:29.270 --> 02:31.229
Keep your eyes open.

02:31.272 --> 02:33.057
Stay alert.

02:55.470 --> 02:57.037
Leave the horses.

02:57.081 --> 02:58.299
I'm not going in there, sir.

02:58.343 --> 03:00.040
Dred's in there.

03:00.084 --> 03:01.626
We haven't been chasing him
for two weeks

03:01.650 --> 03:03.087
to just turn and run

03:03.130 --> 03:05.045
because you're afraid
of the dark.

03:05.089 --> 03:09.049
- Yes, but it seems like a bad idea to...
- All right, all right.

03:09.093 --> 03:11.225
Wait here and keep watch.

03:50.656 --> 03:52.875
Stay together!
Stay together!

04:58.202 --> 05:00.465
This is for Talon...

05:02.771 --> 05:05.557
and your Queen.

06:13.190 --> 06:16.628
This is the same name.

06:16.671 --> 06:20.371
We've been here for days. Is this really
the only name you're going to give me?

06:22.938 --> 06:25.245
Dragman, there are supposed
to be hundreds,

06:25.289 --> 06:28.770
maybe thousands of Lu-Qiri
on the other side of the portal.

06:30.468 --> 06:33.775
So, if I'm going to help Gwynn
defeat the Prime Order,

06:33.819 --> 06:37.257
I need to open the portal and summon
all of the demons by name to this Realm.

06:40.695 --> 06:43.698
Look, I know you can talk.
Explain yourself.

06:45.831 --> 06:48.050
Why have you only given me
this one name?

06:51.532 --> 06:52.707
Fine.

06:55.406 --> 06:57.206
So, is this the first one
you want me to call?

07:02.500 --> 07:07.244
Hopefully this demon's a little
friendlier than the last.

07:09.333 --> 07:10.595
Stand back.

08:08.261 --> 08:09.262
Talon?

08:11.482 --> 08:13.527
Come on, Talon.

08:27.585 --> 08:31.284
Deep breaths.
Exhale on the release.

08:33.111 --> 08:35.854
My people say it's wrong
to take what isn't given,

08:35.897 --> 08:39.553
especially a life.

08:39.597 --> 08:41.903
You do not have to
enjoy the kill,

08:41.947 --> 08:45.472
but we do need to eat.

08:45.516 --> 08:48.345
We only kill to survive.

08:48.388 --> 08:51.348
Shoot on my mark.

08:53.219 --> 08:55.264
Not yet!

08:58.616 --> 09:00.400
It's going out of range, Talon.

09:06.972 --> 09:08.539
A clean kill!

09:17.243 --> 09:22.640
Remmick will feed us
all winter, Talon.

09:22.683 --> 09:25.164
We'll use every part.

09:25.207 --> 09:27.862
And every time it fills
our hungry bellies,

09:27.906 --> 09:31.649
we'll remember its life
and be grateful.

09:32.911 --> 09:34.521
Yeah?

09:34.565 --> 09:35.566
Yeah?

09:42.050 --> 09:44.836
We liked you just as well
when your ears were pointed.

09:44.879 --> 09:46.838
Didn't we, Myron?

09:46.881 --> 09:49.797
Oh, whatever made you think
to cut them off?

09:53.584 --> 09:57.065
Right, here.
I'll finish cleaning that for you.

09:57.109 --> 09:58.937
Now, go and fetch me some water.

09:58.980 --> 10:01.069
There's some serious cooking
that needs doing.

10:01.113 --> 10:02.375
Okay.

10:47.725 --> 10:49.944
Oh, hello.

10:53.731 --> 10:58.692
What have these savages done to
you, taking your ears?

10:58.736 --> 11:02.696
- I did it on my own.
- Disgraceful.

11:02.740 --> 11:04.220
Your mother will be
so ashamed of you.

11:04.263 --> 11:08.049
You don't know me or my mother.

11:08.093 --> 11:11.531
Oh, but I knew you both.

11:11.575 --> 11:14.142
Of course,
the last time I saw you,

11:14.186 --> 11:16.405
you were no bigger than a cat.

11:18.190 --> 11:20.018
Why did you kill them?

11:20.061 --> 11:22.890
They were only humans.

11:22.934 --> 11:26.111
Come. Live among
your own people again.

11:26.154 --> 11:27.765
My people are dead.

11:29.027 --> 11:31.725
Your mother passed
the Asterkinj to you,

11:31.769 --> 11:34.032
so you could pass it on to me.

11:34.075 --> 11:35.595
I don't know what
you're talking about.

12:06.281 --> 12:08.719
We only kill to survive.

12:14.768 --> 12:17.379
Ekkundi is not your Lu-Qiri.
He is mine.

12:36.921 --> 12:39.793
You've seen someone like me,
haven't you?

12:42.013 --> 12:44.015
With this mark?

12:44.058 --> 12:47.366
- Once.
- Where is he?

12:47.409 --> 12:49.281
Dead.

12:52.066 --> 12:54.329
Varlek was my brother.

13:21.313 --> 13:23.054
And then she said
that she loved me.

13:23.097 --> 13:24.882
It was right after
I saved her life, really.

13:24.925 --> 13:29.060
Although, technically,
I guess she did also save mine.

13:29.103 --> 13:31.758
Then she kissed me.

13:34.587 --> 13:36.434
She said it was just
to distract me from the pain,

13:36.458 --> 13:38.243
but I mean,
does that even make sense?

13:42.508 --> 13:44.989
Now if Garret was out
of the picture, well,

13:45.032 --> 13:49.384
maybe... maybe her... her love would
change from... from sibling love

13:49.428 --> 13:51.996
to, well, you know...

13:52.039 --> 13:55.434
But who could compete
with muscle boy, eh?

13:55.477 --> 13:57.741
Are you talking to a Plagueling?

13:57.784 --> 14:00.613
- Janzo!

14:00.657 --> 14:02.833
- Are you all right?
- Naya, yes. Sorry, I'm fine.

14:02.876 --> 14:05.531
You just startled me
a little bit.

14:05.574 --> 14:07.881
Oh, do excuse the mess.
It's just I'm terribly busy.

14:07.925 --> 14:10.667
Just trying to figure out
this Plagueling problem.

14:10.710 --> 14:12.146
Oh. Have you slept?

14:12.190 --> 14:14.714
Janzo can sleep
once he solves the plague.

14:14.758 --> 14:18.065
"Once Janzo solves the plague."

14:18.109 --> 14:21.634
- People are dying.
- Well, I thought you had solved it.

14:21.678 --> 14:24.376
If people stop taking colipsum,
they won't become Plaguelings.

14:24.419 --> 14:27.335
Well, yes, but they're not stopping,
are they, you silly little girl?

14:27.379 --> 14:29.294
It's an addiction.

14:29.337 --> 14:30.730
Mum says we're low on ale.

14:30.774 --> 14:32.950
Will people please
stop sneaking up on me?

14:32.993 --> 14:36.344
Just walked in, Janzo.
Not doing any sneaking.

14:36.388 --> 14:37.868
Same.

14:37.911 --> 14:40.914
Mum says, uh,
you need to move your arse

14:40.958 --> 14:42.699
and be useful for once.

14:42.742 --> 14:44.352
And more wine!

14:44.396 --> 14:45.440
And more wine.

14:45.484 --> 14:46.790
Thank you, Munt.

14:46.833 --> 14:48.617
Another dead one?

14:50.968 --> 14:53.013
You want me to get rid
of it for you?

14:53.057 --> 14:55.712
Yes. Yes, please.

14:55.755 --> 14:58.236
As you can see,
I have got much to do

14:58.279 --> 15:00.412
and very little time
to do it in, so,

15:00.455 --> 15:02.109
can I help you
with something, Naya?

15:02.153 --> 15:04.590
Uh, Queen Rosmund wants
to speak to you.

15:04.633 --> 15:06.244
Right, well, I'm a little busy.

15:06.287 --> 15:09.551
At once. She's surveying
her soldiers near the keep.

15:09.595 --> 15:13.991
Yes, of course. Thank you.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.390
Marshal Wythers,
you must redouble your efforts

15:22.434 --> 15:23.783
in discovering the identity

15:23.827 --> 15:25.611
of the traitor
who set Dred free.

15:25.654 --> 15:27.439
The Watch is already
overworked enough

15:27.482 --> 15:30.007
with the influx of men
into the Outpost.

15:30.050 --> 15:33.662
Who knows this Outpost or
its people like you, Marshal?

15:33.706 --> 15:37.014
Ask your informants the names of
those whose loyalty is suspect.

15:37.057 --> 15:38.798
You want me to spy for you?

15:38.842 --> 15:41.801
I need you to find out
who set him free.

15:43.455 --> 15:46.632
Not that you've exactly
ever wanted my advice, but...

15:46.675 --> 15:49.809
You're going to give it
to me anyway.

15:49.853 --> 15:52.290
Your men have had no time off.

15:52.333 --> 15:54.118
They're exhausted.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.076
They're afraid to ask you
for fear of offending

15:56.120 --> 15:57.904
the delicate ears of the Queen.

15:57.948 --> 16:00.907
Hmm.
Is that how you feel?

16:00.951 --> 16:02.256
Me?

16:02.300 --> 16:04.041
No.

16:04.084 --> 16:06.913
I've never been afraid
to offend anybody,

16:06.957 --> 16:09.220
least of all, a little girl
like Your Majesty.

16:09.263 --> 16:11.788
I keep them on duty, Marshal,

16:11.831 --> 16:13.485
because if Garret
hasn't stopped him,

16:13.528 --> 16:15.289
Ambassador Dred will go
straight to the capital

16:15.313 --> 16:17.273
and return with the full
might of the Prime Order.

16:17.315 --> 16:20.927
And your soldiers will join the
Prime Order when they arrive

16:20.971 --> 16:23.800
if you don't give them
reason to love you.

16:25.410 --> 16:29.936
And don't worry,
my son will find Dred.

16:29.980 --> 16:34.462
- My Queen?
- Ah, brewer.

16:34.506 --> 16:37.030
The sun sets on another day.

16:37.074 --> 16:38.858
What progress have you made
in finding a cure

16:38.902 --> 16:41.034
- for the Plaguelings?
- I've only just begun.

16:41.078 --> 16:43.360
And I'm going to need some more infected
test subjects to carry on my research.

16:43.384 --> 16:46.823
My soldiers will bring you
as many bodies as you need.

16:46.866 --> 16:49.390
It seems since I made
a law against colipsum,

16:49.434 --> 16:51.349
it's more prevalent than ever.

16:51.392 --> 16:54.221
Well, nothing is more enticing
than forbidden pleasures.

16:54.265 --> 16:58.791
Hmm. Yes, well, rather than explaining
to me why my laws are disobeyed,

16:58.835 --> 17:00.195
how about you enforce them
Marshal?

17:00.227 --> 17:02.882
And find me that traitor.

17:02.926 --> 17:05.753
Whatever you say, Your Majesty.

17:09.106 --> 17:10.890
Brewer, have you seen Talon?

17:10.934 --> 17:12.369
I was supposed to meet her here.

17:12.413 --> 17:14.154
- You haven't seen her either?
- No.

17:14.198 --> 17:16.069
I'm gonna go
and find her and, um,

17:16.113 --> 17:18.244
clean myself up a little bit.

17:18.289 --> 17:20.421
Oh, and, brewer,
if you haven't found a cure,

17:20.464 --> 17:22.771
we're all going to fall prey
to the Plagueling epidemic

17:22.815 --> 17:24.772
before the Prime Order
even get here.

17:24.817 --> 17:28.038
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes. Just find a cure.

17:29.953 --> 17:33.043
He is a strange, strange man.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.349
You have no idea, Your Majesty.

18:54.385 --> 18:55.386
Oh.

19:08.051 --> 19:10.357
You're alive?

19:10.401 --> 19:12.185
I thought I killed you.

19:12.229 --> 19:16.189
Excuse me, do you maybe
know what is this place?

19:16.233 --> 19:19.888
Don't make no difference to you
since I gotta kill you again.

19:23.066 --> 19:25.633
Munt, leave him!
Leave him, leave him.

19:25.677 --> 19:28.027
Sorry about that, Brogan.
It's a bit ripe down here.

19:28.071 --> 19:30.029
Munt, this is
your new brother Brogan.

19:30.073 --> 19:31.944
I told him to meet us down here.

19:31.988 --> 19:35.078
- New brother?
- Uh-huh, mm-hmm.

19:35.121 --> 19:37.080
Welcome to the family, brother!

19:37.123 --> 19:39.996
- He's going to be joining
our operation,

19:40.039 --> 19:43.434
smuggling colipsum out of
the Outpost along with Sill.

19:43.477 --> 19:45.827
- Excuse me?
- Uh-huh?

19:45.871 --> 19:47.525
What is this disgusting place?

19:47.568 --> 19:50.310
Oh, my friend, my friend,
my friend.

19:50.354 --> 19:51.920
What you are looking at

19:51.964 --> 19:54.880
is the Realm's one and only
colipsum farm.

19:54.923 --> 19:56.882
- It's all natural.
- Yeah.

19:56.925 --> 19:58.623
Realm-wide distribution.

20:01.756 --> 20:03.410
Munt!

20:03.454 --> 20:06.109
Munt, you've been busy,
haven't you?

20:06.152 --> 20:08.174
I picked up another three from
the night patrol this morning.

20:08.198 --> 20:11.940
Oh, Munty, you are a good boy,
aren't you?

20:11.984 --> 20:15.509
- Good boy.

20:19.905 --> 20:22.734
Don't worry, don't worry,
don't worry.

20:22.777 --> 20:24.040
- You get used to it.

20:24.083 --> 20:26.390
Get used to it.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.305
The more Plagueling
bodies we have,

20:28.348 --> 20:32.091
the more colipsum
we can grow inside them, right?

20:32.135 --> 20:35.268
Oh, Mum, I almost forgot,
a bird came.

20:35.312 --> 20:37.923
Greyskins have another
shipment for you.

20:40.099 --> 20:43.929
Uh-huh. All right, well,
tell them that we will...

20:43.972 --> 20:47.541
Uh, we'll meet them tonight
with all my gold.

20:47.585 --> 20:50.718
Wait, you're not sending me
out there, are you?

20:50.762 --> 20:53.939
Of course not, you imbecile.

20:53.982 --> 20:56.855
You think I'd give all my gold
to those filthy Greyskins?

20:56.898 --> 21:00.337
No, it's just really funny to make
them go all the way out there and wait.

21:03.601 --> 21:07.518
- Yeah, all right, shut up.

21:07.561 --> 21:09.172
- Get back to work.
- Brogan?

21:09.215 --> 21:11.783
Oh. Bye.

21:11.826 --> 21:13.543
You're meant to be the brains
of this operation,

21:13.567 --> 21:14.567
so can you act like it?

21:20.357 --> 21:22.620
Talon? Talon, wake up.

21:22.663 --> 21:23.838
Talon?

21:27.886 --> 21:29.540
How long have I been out for?

21:29.583 --> 21:31.083
I don't know.
I just came looking for you

21:31.107 --> 21:32.499
and found you like this.

21:32.543 --> 21:34.066
What happened to your head?

21:34.110 --> 21:36.373
- Oh, no.
- What?

21:46.078 --> 21:47.819
Guess it wouldn't let her
take it from me.

21:47.862 --> 21:50.256
Um, what wouldn't let who
take it?

21:50.300 --> 21:52.780
The little blue creature
thing in my head.

21:52.824 --> 21:55.000
The one you use
to open your portal?

21:55.043 --> 21:57.045
She must have tried
to cut it out of me,

21:57.089 --> 21:59.091
but it wouldn't let her.

22:05.271 --> 22:07.012
Oh, no.

22:07.055 --> 22:09.667
They took the Dragman.

22:09.710 --> 22:11.147
Who?

22:11.190 --> 22:13.366
- Who took the Dragman?
- A Lu-Qiri.

22:13.410 --> 22:15.020
You summoned another demon?

22:15.063 --> 22:17.041
Talon, you promised
you wouldn't do that without me.

22:17.065 --> 22:19.024
- And a Blackblood.
- A Blackblood?

22:19.067 --> 22:21.113
Yep, and she has her own demon,

22:21.157 --> 22:23.942
the Dragman, and the name
the Dragman translated.

22:23.985 --> 22:25.596
Wait, calm down.
Slowly... just turn...

22:25.639 --> 22:27.598
Slowly explain exactly
what you're talking about.

22:27.641 --> 22:29.861
I thought you were
the only Blackblood.

22:29.904 --> 22:32.342
- No.
- And how many names were given to you?

22:32.385 --> 22:34.648
One.

22:34.692 --> 22:37.173
But we need the Dragman
if we want any more.

22:37.216 --> 22:38.957
We have to save her.

22:41.351 --> 22:44.789
Wait. You think... you think
this Blackblood is bad?

22:44.832 --> 22:48.053
- She kidnapped a child.
- Do we know that for sure?

22:48.096 --> 22:51.361
- What do you mean?
- Talon, how much do we know about the Dragman?

22:51.404 --> 22:53.841
Explain.

22:53.885 --> 22:57.323
The little girl only wrote one specific
name for you to summon, correct?

22:57.367 --> 22:59.195
Then the Blackblood who appeared

22:59.238 --> 23:00.544
somehow walked the little girl

23:00.587 --> 23:03.851
right out of your door all...

23:03.895 --> 23:05.853
All the way through the Outpost

23:05.897 --> 23:08.247
and right out of the gates,
presumably.

23:08.291 --> 23:10.684
And our little friend
just went along with it

23:10.728 --> 23:13.426
without causing
any kind of scene.

23:15.907 --> 23:19.258
Talon, I don't think
we can trust the Dragman.

23:25.699 --> 23:28.136
Do you even know where
you're going, Talon?

23:29.312 --> 23:31.792
Lu-Qiri tracks
are pretty distinct.

23:31.836 --> 23:33.577
It's going to get dark
pretty soon.

23:33.620 --> 23:36.406
How long after sunset do the
Plaguelings start appearing?

23:44.501 --> 23:45.589
The tracks end here.

23:45.632 --> 23:48.069
Can't see any more.

23:48.113 --> 23:49.395
Well, you're not gonna be able to
see any more once it's dark, are you?

23:49.419 --> 23:52.248
Oh, shut up, Janzo.

23:52.291 --> 23:53.727
So glad you found us.

23:56.034 --> 23:57.688
Where's the Dragman?

23:57.731 --> 24:00.299
Somewhere safe.

24:00.343 --> 24:02.954
You almost pass for human,
Blackblood.

24:02.997 --> 24:05.086
- Thank you.
- It wasn't a compliment.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.916
- So you're a Blackblood?
- Pureborn.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.788
Where are the rest?

24:10.831 --> 24:13.007
All the Blackbloods were killed.

24:13.051 --> 24:15.314
- You're the last?
- Who are you?

24:15.358 --> 24:17.142
And why are you here?

24:17.185 --> 24:20.667
I'm here for the same reason
my brother was,

24:20.711 --> 24:23.191
to free our people from the prison
world they were banished to.

24:23.235 --> 24:25.629
The Blackbloods were not
banished, only Lu-Qiri.

24:25.672 --> 24:27.650
There are hundreds of
Blackbloods in the Plane of Ashes

24:27.674 --> 24:28.869
on the other side of the portal.

24:28.893 --> 24:31.025
That's not true.

24:31.069 --> 24:33.898
Did you not see me
come from the other side?

24:33.941 --> 24:35.900
Am I not a Blackblood?

24:35.943 --> 24:38.729
Now you must do your duty.

24:38.772 --> 24:40.905
Open the portal
and help me save our people.

24:40.948 --> 24:43.168
Is that why you kept
the Dragman hostage?

24:43.211 --> 24:46.606
To... to summon more of...
More of your people?

24:46.650 --> 24:49.174
You're lucky
I've let you live, human.

24:49.217 --> 24:51.350
If killing innocent humans
is your plan,

24:51.394 --> 24:52.482
then you're not my people.

24:52.525 --> 24:55.963
- No human is innocent.
- Talon.

24:56.007 --> 24:57.965
I'm not your enemy, Talon.

25:00.011 --> 25:03.623
- We want the same thing.
- And I want the girl back.

25:10.326 --> 25:12.806
Are you all right?
What's it doing?

25:12.850 --> 25:15.026
- It's waiting.
- For what?

25:15.069 --> 25:16.680
For me.

25:43.620 --> 25:46.187
You commanded it not to kill me.

25:46.231 --> 25:49.539
I need you alive,
at least until you give me the Asterkinj.

25:49.582 --> 25:52.019
Oh, and then you'll summon
more of your people, will you?

25:52.063 --> 25:55.240
Once you've got that thing
from Talon's head?

25:55.283 --> 25:57.721
- Talon, don't!
- Why not? It can't kill me.

25:57.764 --> 25:59.070
Oh, jolly good.
Then, please,

25:59.113 --> 26:00.177
let it keep beating
you up to a pulp.

26:00.201 --> 26:01.420
I have to save the girl.

26:01.464 --> 26:02.769
She's not even here, Talon.

26:02.813 --> 26:04.597
And if what you've
just said is true,

26:04.641 --> 26:07.295
then she is safe as long as she's
valuable to you for a trade.

26:07.339 --> 26:09.472
Please.

26:14.999 --> 26:16.392
Another time.

26:16.435 --> 26:21.092
Yes. Take the time
to think about all this.

26:21.135 --> 26:24.269
You will realize
that I'm not the enemy.

26:24.312 --> 26:27.272
Next time we meet,
it will be as allies.

26:27.315 --> 26:28.926
I doubt that.

26:40.981 --> 26:44.420
We have orders to escort you
directly to the Queen.

26:46.857 --> 26:48.728
Can't you see that this woman

26:48.772 --> 26:50.861
- is in no condition to...
- I have my orders.

26:56.301 --> 26:57.887
No, no, I don't need
this thing for Talon.

26:57.911 --> 27:00.479
It's important to make
an impression, Your Majesty.

27:00.523 --> 27:01.698
Even for your friends.

27:05.876 --> 27:10.402
Gods, what happened?
You look absolutely awful.

27:10.446 --> 27:15.146
Oh, don't be like that.
Come sit by me. Leave us.

27:15.189 --> 27:16.887
Naya, fetch some tea.

27:16.930 --> 27:19.629
Oh, and get rid of this
obnoxious thing.

27:19.672 --> 27:21.761
- You don't have to do that.
- Do what?

27:21.805 --> 27:23.894
Act like you're not royalty.

27:23.937 --> 27:25.262
It won't change
anything between us.

27:25.286 --> 27:28.159
Please sit, Talon.

27:30.378 --> 27:31.510
Thank you, Naya.

27:31.554 --> 27:33.120
Don't worry,
we can serve ourselves.

27:36.167 --> 27:37.647
I'm so glad you're here.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.562
I've been so looking
forward to seeing you.

27:39.605 --> 27:41.085
About what?

27:41.128 --> 27:45.524
Well, don't you think it's time

27:45.568 --> 27:48.701
that you put what happened
between Garret and I behind you?

27:51.182 --> 27:53.924
You think that's all
that's wrong between us?

27:53.967 --> 27:57.580
- That I'm jealous?
- Well, isn't it?

27:57.623 --> 28:01.148
- What else have I done?
- How about when you saved Dred

28:01.192 --> 28:03.934
so you could
execute him yourself?

28:03.977 --> 28:05.718
And then you let him escape.

28:05.762 --> 28:07.938
And now Garrett's been gone
for almost a fortnight...

28:07.981 --> 28:09.089
If what I've heard is true,
you had another chance

28:09.113 --> 28:10.462
to kill Dred,
and you let him go.

28:10.506 --> 28:13.160
You should have gone
with Garret to find Dred.

28:13.204 --> 28:14.771
Janzo was dying.

28:14.814 --> 28:17.382
Perhaps he was,

28:17.425 --> 28:19.210
but you had your duty.

28:22.648 --> 28:24.389
- See, there you go.
- What?

28:24.432 --> 28:25.999
You act like
I'm your closest companion,

28:26.043 --> 28:28.393
your dearest friend,

28:28.436 --> 28:30.066
but really I'm just a weapon
with a duty towards you.

28:30.090 --> 28:32.397
Are the two mutually exclusive?

28:32.440 --> 28:35.574
Can't you be both?

28:35.618 --> 28:37.117
I might not be so good
at the weapon part now.

28:37.141 --> 28:39.491
Why? What happened?

28:39.535 --> 28:44.801
The Dragman translated a name
and I summoned a demon.

28:44.844 --> 28:46.498
And?

28:48.631 --> 28:52.156
Another Blackblood came through the
portal, took control of it.

28:52.199 --> 28:57.378
She escaped with the name,
the demon, and the Dragman.

28:57.422 --> 29:00.425
You still want to be friends?

29:00.468 --> 29:03.994
Talon, I have a responsibility
to this Outpost,

29:04.037 --> 29:06.257
to the whole world,
and so do you.

29:07.475 --> 29:09.913
Don't worry.

29:09.956 --> 29:12.785
I'll do whatever I have to
to get the Dragman back.

29:20.663 --> 29:22.665
Well, that went well.

29:38.289 --> 29:40.247
How long have you been
on duty, soldier?

29:40.291 --> 29:41.988
Since this time last night,
Your Majesty.

29:42.032 --> 29:45.644
Give this man
one sun cycle of leisure.

29:45.688 --> 29:46.819
When you've had some sleep,

29:46.863 --> 29:47.970
tell the brewer
at the Night Shade

29:47.994 --> 29:49.387
that your drinks
are on the Queen.

29:49.430 --> 29:51.476
Yes, Your Majesty.

29:51.519 --> 29:54.044
- Just don't drink too much.
- Yes, Majesty.

29:54.087 --> 29:55.480
Rider approaching!

30:06.012 --> 30:08.580
- Get him down.
- Get him some water.

30:11.975 --> 30:12.976
Thank you.

30:15.892 --> 30:17.720
Where's everyone else, boy?

30:23.726 --> 30:25.684
- They're all dead.

30:25.728 --> 30:28.818
All of them?
What about Garret?

30:31.037 --> 30:32.038
He is too, sir.

30:34.911 --> 30:37.435
- That can't be true.
- He's dead, sir.

30:37.478 --> 30:39.306
I saw the sword myself.

30:39.350 --> 30:40.307
Stabbed right through his heart.

30:40.351 --> 30:43.615
And what did you do? Run?

30:43.659 --> 30:45.748
Leave your commanding officer
behind to die?

30:45.791 --> 30:48.030
Well, no, it wasn't like that.
He was already dead when I...

30:48.054 --> 30:51.797
- Coward!
- They killed everyone. There was nothing...

31:03.896 --> 31:06.420
Who did it?

31:06.464 --> 31:08.161
Dred.

31:09.293 --> 31:11.077
And some woman.

31:12.644 --> 31:16.387
- Where are they?
- Dun-ebdin.

31:47.505 --> 31:50.116
Don't mean to disturb you,
Your Majesty.

31:51.944 --> 31:56.253
I'm sorry for your loss,
Marshal.

31:56.296 --> 31:58.734
Your son was a hero
to all who knew him.

32:02.085 --> 32:04.087
I know you loved him.

32:06.089 --> 32:08.004
He was lucky to have you.

32:12.443 --> 32:15.272
I just wanted to let you know

32:15.315 --> 32:17.840
that I'll be leaving
the Outpost for a few days.

32:20.146 --> 32:23.410
I'm heading out to bring
my son's body back.

32:24.672 --> 32:28.459
He deserves to rest here.

32:33.464 --> 32:36.467
I'll, uh...
I'll send a squad of soldiers.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.600
I need you here, Marshal.

32:39.644 --> 32:41.994
You're about to go to war.

32:42.038 --> 32:45.171
You need soldiers
here right now,

32:45.215 --> 32:47.783
not a tired old copper.

32:47.826 --> 32:53.005
I need both.

32:53.049 --> 32:55.051
But I can see that your mind
is set on going.

32:56.487 --> 33:00.360
Yes, it is, Your Majesty.

33:15.723 --> 33:17.508
Bring him home.

33:25.255 --> 33:26.299
Oi!

33:28.388 --> 33:29.668
Where do you think you're going?

33:30.477 --> 33:33.350
Garret needs help.

33:33.393 --> 33:35.482
- Garret's dead.
- Yeah, well, I don't believe it.

33:35.526 --> 33:39.486
Yeah, I don't want to believe it
either, but it's true.

33:39.530 --> 33:42.402
- I'm going.
- You're not going.

33:42.446 --> 33:44.752
I'll collect the body,

33:44.796 --> 33:48.104
and if by some miracle
of the gods he's still alive,

33:48.147 --> 33:49.670
I'll bring my boy back.

33:49.714 --> 33:51.150
Yeah, well, I'm still going.

33:53.152 --> 33:54.893
I have to stop Dred.

33:54.937 --> 33:57.591
He's long gone.

33:57.635 --> 33:59.898
That soldier took five days
to get here.

33:59.942 --> 34:03.249
The person who did this
went in the other direction.

34:03.293 --> 34:06.687
- So what?
- So...

34:06.731 --> 34:11.083
it means that bastard
is ten days out of here.

34:11.127 --> 34:12.518
Unless you can feed that horse

34:12.563 --> 34:14.043
some of that
magic blood of yours,

34:14.085 --> 34:16.306
you haven't got a chance
of catching up.

34:16.349 --> 34:20.788
- Then watch me.
- Dred is already at the capital by now.

34:20.831 --> 34:22.616
You'll never get
anywhere near him.

34:22.659 --> 34:25.445
Then I'll fight my way in.

34:25.489 --> 34:29.710
I'm sure you will, Blackblood.

34:29.754 --> 34:32.539
But not even you
will get past stone walls,

34:32.583 --> 34:36.021
steel doors,
and an army of Red Guard.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.938
And once you're dead trying,

34:39.982 --> 34:41.984
Dred will come back here
with his army

34:42.027 --> 34:43.768
and attack this bloody Outpost

34:43.811 --> 34:45.378
and kill Gwynn
and everyone in it!

34:45.422 --> 34:47.598
Well, I have to do something.

34:49.992 --> 34:53.647
What you have to do
is stay here,

34:53.690 --> 34:57.347
figure out how to summon up
that damn army of things

34:57.390 --> 34:58.957
or whatever they are,

34:59.001 --> 35:03.092
and help Gwynn defeat the
Prime Order once and for all.

35:08.358 --> 35:10.534
I hate it when you're right.

35:13.667 --> 35:15.278
I'm always right.

35:56.101 --> 35:57.798
Hyah! Hyah!

36:14.815 --> 36:16.208
Janzo, bring me another round.

36:16.252 --> 36:17.692
You've had more than enough,
my love.

36:17.731 --> 36:18.795
I've seen whole regiments
drink less.

36:18.819 --> 36:21.344
Am I still conscious?

36:21.387 --> 36:23.737
More or less.

36:23.781 --> 36:25.130
Then bring me another.

36:38.926 --> 36:41.451
I refuse to fight with you
another minute.

36:41.494 --> 36:43.975
You look terrible.

36:44.019 --> 36:46.195
Thank you. So do you.

36:48.414 --> 36:51.374
Janzo, we're going to need
something stronger than ale.

36:51.417 --> 36:54.464
And close the doors.
I don't want anyone coming in.

36:54.507 --> 36:56.901
You and I are going to
play a game of Octor

36:56.944 --> 36:58.685
until we can't see any longer.

37:08.739 --> 37:11.089
Gwynn, I'm sorry about Garret.

37:11.133 --> 37:14.092
Yes. Everyone's sorry.

37:17.748 --> 37:18.836
It was your loss, too.

37:24.146 --> 37:26.539
You know, Talon,
you're the only real friend I have left.

37:28.324 --> 37:29.803
Well, I don't envy you that.

37:31.370 --> 37:34.286
- What?
- Me...

37:34.330 --> 37:36.114
being all you have left.

37:40.292 --> 37:42.120
Ouch.

37:42.164 --> 37:45.863
Yes. Yes, a true friend
wouldn't beat me so quickly.

37:52.478 --> 37:54.959
What am I going to do now?

37:55.002 --> 37:56.545
Dred has probably
gone straight to the Three

37:56.569 --> 37:59.311
and informed them
of our rebellion.

37:59.355 --> 38:03.576
In 20 days, we could have 50,000
elite Covenant soldiers at our gates.

38:05.361 --> 38:08.320
Do they really care that much
about the Outpost?

38:08.364 --> 38:10.453
It's not the Outpost, Naya.
It's me.

38:10.496 --> 38:13.760
I threaten the very legitimacy
of the Prime Order.

38:13.804 --> 38:15.153
Without a royal to follow,

38:15.197 --> 38:16.477
they can't bow down
to the Three.

38:16.502 --> 38:18.809
I threaten their very existence.

38:20.811 --> 38:22.769
Then you must hide.

38:22.813 --> 38:24.554
That accomplishes nothing.

38:24.597 --> 38:26.686
I must fight.

38:26.730 --> 38:29.559
But we can only muster 3,000,

38:29.602 --> 38:32.779
mostly untrained
and ill-equipped,

38:32.823 --> 38:34.216
and now without a commander.

38:35.956 --> 38:39.351
The regional governors
were once barons and baronesses,

38:39.395 --> 38:41.634
proud families that have been
forced to give up their titles

38:41.658 --> 38:44.704
and swear allegiance
to the Prime Order.

38:44.748 --> 38:48.795
- Of course.
- Perhaps many of them have not forgotten,

38:48.839 --> 38:50.884
and would be happy to see
the Prime Order overthrown

38:50.928 --> 38:53.148
and replaced by a royal heir.

38:54.323 --> 38:56.194
We invite the barons,

38:56.238 --> 38:58.022
and our uprising
will be revealed

38:58.065 --> 39:00.392
- to every corner of the Realm.
- Well, you just said yourself

39:00.416 --> 39:01.808
that Dred will tell them anyway.

39:01.852 --> 39:04.507
Maybe Dred won't make it.

39:04.550 --> 39:06.204
I can't risk exposing myself.

39:06.248 --> 39:08.206
Your Majesty, need I remind you

39:08.250 --> 39:09.773
you have a spy in these walls.

39:09.816 --> 39:12.645
They will discover
your treasons anyway.

39:16.258 --> 39:18.216
What do you suggest I do?

39:18.260 --> 39:22.655
Send out riders to every former
noble, calling them to arms.

39:22.699 --> 39:25.876
Dare them to stand with you
against the Prime Order tyrants.

39:27.443 --> 39:30.837
Maybe you're right.

39:30.881 --> 39:32.448
Send for the scribes.

39:41.283 --> 39:43.720
So you're the Dragman?

39:48.725 --> 39:50.379
You're just a child.

39:52.119 --> 39:55.253
My mother was
Maylock of Gellhall.

39:55.297 --> 39:59.692
She was taught the Purpose by her
mother, Aurenya of Gellhall.

39:59.736 --> 40:01.651
So it's been passed
through generations.

40:01.694 --> 40:04.654
Yes, I knew her mother, Iothina.

40:04.697 --> 40:07.265
You would have to be
over 300 years old.

40:09.702 --> 40:12.531
Time is not the same
in the Plane of Ashes.

40:14.533 --> 40:16.492
There's no sun to measure days.

40:18.494 --> 40:20.452
No moon to measure seasons.

40:22.933 --> 40:25.370
Who knows how long
we have suffered there?

40:25.414 --> 40:28.634
I'll do whatever it takes
to return my people home.

40:28.678 --> 40:32.464
It's time for a Pureborn
to take the Asterkinj.

40:32.508 --> 40:35.685
If Talon refuses
to pass it on to you?

40:35.728 --> 40:37.904
You cannot take it
away from her.

40:55.531 --> 40:59.143
She will give it to me.

40:59.186 --> 41:01.711
Her only decision will be

41:01.754 --> 41:03.930
whether it happens
the easy way or...

41:03.974 --> 41:06.106
it happens the painful way.
