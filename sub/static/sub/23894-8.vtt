25:01.961 --> 25:03.571
We betrayed them Ruby.

25:03.702 --> 25:05.573
Left them trapped all this time.

25:05.704 --> 25:07.923
They will destroy us.

25:11.623 --> 25:12.711
What's that?

25:14.947 --> 25:16.366
One of the Knights.

25:17.629 --> 25:18.978
She was watching the house.

25:21.067 --> 25:23.722
Ash must have told her where to find us.

25:23.852 --> 25:25.854
Fuck you, demon!

25:25.985 --> 25:27.769
Mm, she is a feisty one.

25:27.900 --> 25:30.206
You are a persistent bunch.

25:30.337 --> 25:33.993
<i>Mulier daemonium de igne.</i>

25:34.123 --> 25:35.734
Florence Latin.

25:38.747 --> 25:41.261
Kaya, I know what to do.

25:41.391 --> 25:43.916
Kaya?!

25:44.046 --> 25:46.266
The traitor!

25:46.396 --> 25:48.311
How could you do this to us?

25:48.442 --> 25:49.965
To mankind?

25:50.096 --> 25:51.706
What did she promise...

25:54.404 --> 25:55.928
What are you going to do to me!?

25:56.058 --> 25:57.582
Relax.

26:01.877 --> 26:03.987
You're gonna help us
re-write our destiny.
