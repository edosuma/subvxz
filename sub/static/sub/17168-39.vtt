Exciting news, Titans.

00:29.764 --> 00:32.431
I am buying team jackets.

of the jackets.

No, Star, I'm talking

00:41.942 --> 00:44.143
So everyone knows

00:47.581 --> 00:49.148

fashion-forward combination.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.624
(GASPS) If we all
have the same jacket,

00:58.626 --> 01:00.559
how will we know
which one is mine?

01:00.561 --> 01:03.862
Because it's going to
have your name on it.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.403
But puffy sleeves
and embroidered names

01:11.405 --> 01:12.671
don't come cheap.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.039
Aren't you guys worried
about wasting money?

01:14.041 --> 01:15.908
Why wouldn't we
want to waste money?

01:15.910 --> 01:17.743
I don't know.
So we have some later?

01:17.745 --> 01:19.645

Here you go.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.199
Uh, uh, uh, this denim

02:20.608 --> 02:22.174
Shouldn't we be eating
a little more healthy?

02:22.176 --> 02:24.143
Why would we want to
eat healthy, mama?

02:24.145 --> 02:26.578
I don't know, so we don't
have health problems later.

Later? You mean, when we
might need that money

02:28.582 --> 02:29.748

bit of money left over.

eaten healthy foods,

we wouldn't need
so much medicine.

and this is "later".

04:48.489 --> 04:50.222
I thought this was "now".

04:50.224 --> 04:52.691
This is "now" but it's
"later" from then.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.459
-When was then?
-Then was before.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.994
Now is "later".

-Because it was
later than before?
-Exactly.

about a retirement plan

is the compound interest.

move the applecart.

08:19.566 --> 08:20.832

Guys, I was wrong.
We're young,

09:17.858 --> 09:20.525
and that means we should be
making the worst decisions
of our lives.

09:20.527 --> 09:21.393
ALL: Yeah!

09:21.395 --> 09:22.928
CYBORG: Not so fast, youngins!

09:22.930 --> 09:24.663
If you won't take
care of yourselves,

09:24.665 --> 09:25.764
we'll take care of you.

09:25.766 --> 09:26.998
We'll see about that.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.633
BOTH: Titans, go!

09:35.675 --> 09:37.509
Hot diggity dog!

09:37.511 --> 09:39.411
I got old man strength.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.113
Thanks for taking such
good care of ourselves.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.015
I know life
like this is boring.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.850
But if you make
bad decisions today,

09:45.852 --> 09:47.452
we won't be around later.

09:47.454 --> 09:48.753
That's it.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.423
The only way to stop us
is to make bad decisions.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.759
I am going to ride
my motorcycle.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.628
(ENGINE RUMBLING)

09:56.630 --> 10:00.231
Wait, wait. That's a
very dangerous hobby.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.000
No!

10:02.002 --> 10:03.134
It's working.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.203
Titans, endanger your futures!

10:05.205 --> 10:07.038
We're gonna sit here all day.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.240
And watch TV, yo.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.876
BOTH: So unhealthy!

10:11.878 --> 10:16.815
Hello, I would like to order
the expensive shoes with
the colors on the bottoms.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.717
Goodbye, the moneys!

10:18.719 --> 10:22.053
I will not be able to
afford the funeral.

10:22.055 --> 10:25.323
And my cats will leave me!

10:25.325 --> 10:27.926
I thought you liked
old people, dear.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.995
Not as much as I like
fried chicken.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.863
Ah! Cholesterol!

10:31.865 --> 10:33.231
Saturated fats!

10:33.233 --> 10:35.900
Our triglycerides are
through the roof!

10:35.902 --> 10:37.402
Oh.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.404
Great job, Titans.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.473
We've saved ourselves
from old age.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.943
Let's go live our lives
to the shortest, yo!

10:44.945 --> 10:47.679
ALL: Whoo!

10:51.851 --> 10:54.519
