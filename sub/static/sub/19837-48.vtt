00:02.480 --> 00:03.730
<b>No good...</b>

00:03.730 --> 00:05.670
<b>I've got nothing.</b>

00:06.560 --> 00:09.980
<b>That two billion reward 
per spider is attractive,</b>

00:10.440 --> 00:12.670
<b>but finding them will be impossible.</b>

00:12.670 --> 00:13.670
<b>Yeah...</b>

00:14.240 --> 00:19.050
<b>Hey, we could ask for concrete 
information on the Net.</b>

00:19.050 --> 00:22.000
<b>Like about the Troupe's current location.</b>

00:22.460 --> 00:25.250
<b>We could offer a large reward.</b>

00:25.600 --> 00:26.640
<b>Hold on...</b>

00:26.640 --> 00:28.490
<b>We don't have the money for that.</b>

00:29.270 --> 00:30.500
<b>It'll be fine.</b>

01:54.000 --> 01:59.050
<b>Very x Sharp x Eye</b>

02:00.170 --> 02:02.680
<b>Gon and his friends are 
pursuing the Phantom Troupe,</b>

02:02.680 --> 02:04.980
<b>and have now obtained the money</b>

02:04.980 --> 02:07.980
<b>to buy the information they need.</b>

02:10.560 --> 02:11.900
<b>That's crazy...</b>

02:11.900 --> 02:13.940
<b>You actually have money.</b>

02:13.940 --> 02:17.900
<b>Man, you really pawned 
your Hunter License?</b>

02:17.900 --> 02:19.900
<b>You're insane.</b>

02:19.900 --> 02:22.280
<b>So, what should we do first?</b>

02:22.940 --> 02:26.790
<b>Let's start by purchasing 
a Southernbees catalog.</b>

02:31.030 --> 02:35.120
<b>Here is this year's 
Southernbees auction catalog.</b>

02:35.120 --> 02:36.160
<b>Thanks.</b>

02:41.550 --> 02:42.580
<b>There it is!</b>

02:42.580 --> 02:43.870
<b><i>Greed Island</i> !</b>

02:44.640 --> 02:47.180
<b>Seven total copies on sale...</b>

02:47.670 --> 02:51.440
<b>The minimum starting bid is 8.9 billion.</b>

02:52.440 --> 02:53.850
<b>Just as expected.</b>

02:57.490 --> 03:00.200
<b>Now we wait for the 
information to come in.</b>

03:00.770 --> 03:04.330
<b>First, we catch one of the spiders 
and make them tell us where</b>

03:04.330 --> 03:08.470
<b>the rest are hiding, 
so that we can bag them all!</b>

03:08.470 --> 03:09.200
<b>Huh?</b>

03:10.490 --> 03:11.710
<b>What's wrong, Gon?</b>

03:12.980 --> 03:14.210
<b>This is...</b>

03:15.080 --> 03:17.330
<b>Oh, a Ben's knife.</b>

03:17.330 --> 03:18.590
<b>A Ben's knife?</b>

03:19.220 --> 03:22.440
<b>A hundred years ago, 
a mass murderer designed it.</b>

03:22.940 --> 03:24.990
<b>He was a famous blacksmith.</b>

03:25.530 --> 03:27.310
<b>This is one of his original works.</b>

03:28.020 --> 03:31.510
<b>It's a lesser-known piece that a 
lot of rabid collectors are after.</b>

03:31.960 --> 03:33.300
<b>So, you recognized it.</b>

03:33.300 --> 03:35.440
<b>No, I didn't.</b>

03:35.440 --> 03:36.290
<b>Huh?</b>

03:36.750 --> 03:40.070
<b>It happened to catch my eye, 
so I got curious</b>

03:40.070 --> 03:41.810
<b>and I used <i>Gyo</i>.</b>

03:42.240 --> 03:44.960
<b>That's when I noticed a faint aura on it.</b>

03:44.960 --> 03:45.700
<b><i>Gyo</i> ?</b>

03:46.280 --> 03:47.580
<b>A form of <i>Nen</i>.</b>

03:48.000 --> 03:50.830
<b>Basically, you look really 
hard at something.</b>

03:53.850 --> 03:54.930
<b>You're right.</b>

03:54.930 --> 03:56.340
<b>Let me have a look.</b>

03:58.610 --> 04:00.840
<b>Nope, I don't see a thing.</b>

04:01.320 --> 04:03.710
<b>You will, once you spend 
more time training in <i>Ren</i>.</b>

04:03.710 --> 04:06.260
<b>Right! There's another way!</b>

04:06.260 --> 04:07.250
<b>Another way?</b>

04:07.250 --> 04:08.680
<b>Another way to make money.</b>

04:09.430 --> 04:13.810
<b>Remember how four-eyes mentioned that</b>

04:13.810 --> 04:18.820
<b>really talented people use <i>Nen</i> without 
even realizing it themselves?</b>

04:19.270 --> 04:20.820
<b>Four-eyes?</b>

04:21.730 --> 04:22.820
<b>Wing-san.</b>

04:22.820 --> 04:24.570
<b>He taught us <i>Nen</i>.</b>

04:25.100 --> 04:29.050
<b>If we search for items with 
aura on them, like this knife,</b>

04:29.050 --> 04:32.710
<b>it's likely some genius made them.</b>

04:33.110 --> 04:34.210
<b>I get it!</b>

04:34.210 --> 04:37.010
<b>We can find hidden gems</b>

04:37.010 --> 04:39.340
<b>with no formal appraisal training.</b>

04:39.740 --> 04:43.090
<b>Then we auction the items at a higher price!</b>

04:43.510 --> 04:46.840
<b>If you guys want that, 
write down your price.</b>

04:48.080 --> 04:50.980
<b>Customers are supposed to 
name their own prices?</b>

04:50.980 --> 04:54.230
<b>Yeah, that's how this market works.</b>

04:54.810 --> 04:58.020
<b>You write down what you're willing to pay,</b>

04:58.020 --> 05:02.480
<b>and when time expires, 
the highest bidder wins the item.</b>

05:03.070 --> 05:05.610
<b>Understand? Popular items</b>

05:05.610 --> 05:09.260
<b>will see their prices shoot up.</b>

05:10.640 --> 05:12.120
<b>I get it now.</b>

05:16.530 --> 05:18.930
<b>Well, then let's get started.</b>

05:18.930 --> 05:21.780
<b>I'll check the online forums.</b>

05:21.780 --> 05:22.570
<b>Okay!</b>

05:28.200 --> 05:32.410
<b><i>This is a weird pot, but I detect aura...</i></b>

05:33.790 --> 05:35.020
<b><i>Someone already bid!</i></b>

05:36.070 --> 05:40.270
<b><i>If a bid has already been placed, 
enter one that's 2.5 times higher.</i></b>

05:40.760 --> 05:45.780
<b><i>Even if you end up bidding too high, 
you'll succeed in discouraging any rivals.</i></b>

05:46.340 --> 05:49.280
<b><i>500 multiplied by 2.5...</i></b>

05:49.700 --> 05:51.360
<b><i>Let's see...</i></b>

05:59.180 --> 06:00.560
<b>It's the same person!</b>

06:02.080 --> 06:03.480
<b>Same on your side?</b>

06:03.480 --> 06:05.550
<b>I found a couple items,</b>

06:05.550 --> 06:08.680
<b>but both had bids already placed by "Zepile."</b>

06:09.320 --> 06:12.030
<b>And after I entered a bid 2.5 times higher,</b>

06:12.030 --> 06:13.640
<b>he multiplied that by 4.</b>

06:14.500 --> 06:15.930
<b>Then it isn't a coincidence?</b>

06:16.640 --> 06:17.590
<b>No.</b>

06:17.590 --> 06:18.890
<b>What should we do?</b>

06:18.890 --> 06:21.940
<b>Keep placing bids until the deadline.</b>

06:22.330 --> 06:25.590
<b>There are two of us, so we'll win some!</b>

06:26.130 --> 06:27.020
<b>Okay.</b>

06:32.490 --> 06:34.870
<b>So ultimately, we won three and lost one.</b>

06:34.870 --> 06:37.450
<b>Yeah, he got that weird pot.</b>

06:38.080 --> 06:40.470
<b>Well, that wasn't too bad.</b>

06:40.470 --> 06:43.520
<b>Let's take these to the auction house now.</b>

06:46.570 --> 06:49.000
<b>I am very sorry.</b>

06:49.000 --> 06:54.010
<b>But the auction house cannot 
accept any additional items,</b>

06:54.010 --> 06:56.220
<b>once the catalog has been published.</b>

06:56.220 --> 06:58.060
<b>Isn't there any way?</b>

06:58.060 --> 07:00.730
<b>We really want to auction these.</b>

07:02.940 --> 07:07.120
<b>I suggest that you give 
the trade market a try.</b>

07:07.120 --> 07:08.620
<b>The trade market?</b>

07:11.240 --> 07:12.800
<b>The trade market...</b>

07:12.800 --> 07:16.870
<b>Professionals will be here, so if one of these 
is genuine, we should get a great price.</b>

07:17.490 --> 07:20.490
<b>I wanted to sell these at the auction, though.</b>

07:20.490 --> 07:22.120
<b>How much do you think we'll get?</b>

07:22.880 --> 07:24.380
<b>Let's find out.</b>

07:28.010 --> 07:31.260
<b>Oh, you found these in your cellar?</b>

07:31.620 --> 07:32.540
<b>Yep!</b>

07:32.540 --> 07:35.350
<b>Dad said to sell them if the price was right.</b>

07:36.230 --> 07:38.280
<b>These are wonderful pieces.</b>

07:38.280 --> 07:42.020
<b>Only fifty copies were printed, and yours has</b>

07:42.020 --> 07:43.250
<b>a single-digit serial number.</b>

07:43.250 --> 07:45.520
<b>And an authentic autograph.</b>

07:46.270 --> 07:47.600
<b><i>We know.</i></b>

07:47.600 --> 07:49.950
<b><i>That's where the aura was coming from.</i></b>

07:49.950 --> 07:52.450
<b>I'd guess it's worth at least 150,000.</b>

07:54.660 --> 07:56.780
<b>This antique doll is also excellent...</b>

07:57.740 --> 07:59.200
<b>It's in great shape,</b>

07:59.200 --> 08:02.540
<b>and the pristine condition of both 
box and doll raises the value.</b>

08:03.190 --> 08:05.390
<b>I'm estimating 300,000.</b>

08:05.800 --> 08:06.670
<b>However,</b>

08:07.230 --> 08:10.670
<b>this one isn't worth much, unfortunately.</b>

08:10.670 --> 08:11.680
<b>Huh?</b>

08:12.070 --> 08:14.680
<b>The box and statue are 
from different periods.</b>

08:15.420 --> 08:17.770
<b>The box was made recently.</b>

08:17.770 --> 08:21.270
<b>The statue is rough and doesn't 
adhere to any theme.</b>

08:21.900 --> 08:24.190
<b>I'd say it's only worth 1,500 Jenny.</b>

08:25.360 --> 08:28.190
<b><i>But there is a little aura...</i></b>

08:28.850 --> 08:31.480
<b>However, that would be its 
appraisal as an artwork.</b>

08:32.000 --> 08:35.390
<b>The wood itself is quite valuable.</b>

08:36.690 --> 08:39.200
<b>So I'll make you an offer.</b>

08:40.130 --> 08:43.530
<b>If you sell me the painting 
and doll for 420,000,</b>

08:43.530 --> 08:45.710
<b>I'll buy the wood for 80,000.</b>

08:46.120 --> 08:48.240
<b>A total of 500,000?</b>

08:48.240 --> 08:49.340
<b>What do you think?</b>

08:49.340 --> 08:51.720
<b>Feel free to think it over.</b>

08:51.720 --> 08:55.720
<b>But I doubt anyone will quote 
you a better price.</b>

08:56.240 --> 09:00.720
<b>In the meantime, let me 
check this wood's age.</b>

09:01.150 --> 09:02.220
<b>Wait!</b>

09:03.460 --> 09:05.900
<b>Put down that statue.</b>

09:05.900 --> 09:07.480
<b>Wh-Who are you?</b>

09:08.650 --> 09:11.070
<b>Don't let him scam you, kid.</b>

09:11.070 --> 09:13.520
<b>He's offering a fair price 
for the painting and doll,</b>

09:13.520 --> 09:15.490
<b>but he's lying about the statue!</b>

09:16.020 --> 09:18.520
<b>I-I never lied!</b>

09:18.820 --> 09:20.240
<b>Really?</b>

09:20.240 --> 09:23.660
<b>No collector would pay 
80,000 for that wood.</b>

09:23.660 --> 09:25.000
<b>You're interested in</b>

09:25.750 --> 09:27.620
<b>the contents of that statue!</b>

09:38.220 --> 09:40.400
<b>It's a wooden trove.</b>

09:40.400 --> 09:41.840
<b>A wooden trove?</b>

09:41.840 --> 09:43.690
<b>Three hundred years ago,</b>

09:43.690 --> 09:47.540
<b>these were a popular way for the 
wealthy to hide their money.</b>

09:47.540 --> 09:49.230
<b>To hide their money...</b>

09:49.860 --> 09:54.320
<b>If it's real, there should be valuables inside.</b>

09:55.130 --> 09:59.490
<b>You planned to steal the contents, 
while pretending to check its age!</b>

09:59.490 --> 10:01.970
<b>I-I would never do that...</b>

10:01.970 --> 10:03.120
<b>Wait.</b>

10:04.010 --> 10:07.850
<b>Can you prove that this is 
a genuine wooden trove?</b>

10:07.850 --> 10:09.120
<b>What?</b>

10:09.690 --> 10:13.320
<b>The wood is certainly over 
three hundred years old.</b>

10:13.320 --> 10:16.510
<b>But that only tells us the material's age.</b>

10:17.030 --> 10:19.330
<b>The statue itself could be modern.</b>

10:20.140 --> 10:23.710
<b>This technique is known as hoodwinking, boys.</b>

10:23.710 --> 10:25.140
<b>Technique?</b>

10:25.600 --> 10:29.520
<b>He's referring to a counterfeiter trying 
to trick a professional appraiser.</b>

10:29.520 --> 10:31.020
<b>But that isn't what I'm doing.</b>

10:31.510 --> 10:33.320
<b>Here's a seam that an amateur</b>

10:33.320 --> 10:35.030
<b>would never recognize.</b>

10:35.740 --> 10:37.690
<b>The seam contains an adhesive</b>

10:37.690 --> 10:40.280
<b>used back in that period.</b>

10:40.990 --> 10:43.890
<b>You're insisting this is a real wooden trove?</b>

10:43.890 --> 10:44.910
<b>Yeah.</b>

10:46.250 --> 10:49.410
<b>But it is possible that it was opened 
once to swap out its contents,</b>

10:49.410 --> 10:52.170
<b>and the statue was reassembled.</b>

10:52.700 --> 10:54.670
<b>We'd call that a dud.</b>

10:55.420 --> 10:57.380
<b>It's called double-dipping,</b>

10:57.380 --> 11:02.430
<b>placing new adhesive on top 
of the old to create a dud.</b>

11:02.870 --> 11:05.930
<b>But only an amateur would try that.</b>

11:07.300 --> 11:09.570
<b>A professional would melt 
the adhesive with a flame,</b>

11:09.570 --> 11:10.940
<b>before resealing it.</b>

11:11.340 --> 11:15.200
<b>That way, it would appear as though 
the statue had never been opened.</b>

11:15.200 --> 11:17.140
<b>That's known as welding.</b>

11:18.120 --> 11:19.820
<b>It hasn't been welded.</b>

11:19.820 --> 11:25.450
<b>If fire were used, the wood would be scarred 
or the adhesive would have discolored.</b>

11:25.450 --> 11:28.830
<b>Even the pros have a hard time 
weighing those details.</b>

11:28.830 --> 11:30.800
<b>I can't trust you.</b>

11:31.460 --> 11:33.380
<b>I'm a pro appraiser!</b>

11:33.380 --> 11:34.960
<b>I swear by my eyes...</b>

11:35.610 --> 11:37.630
<b>This is a real wooden trove!</b>

11:38.190 --> 11:39.670
<b>It's never been opened,</b>

11:39.670 --> 11:42.760
<b>and the treasure inside 
hasn't been swapped out!</b>

11:44.980 --> 11:46.360
<b>Okay,</b>

11:46.360 --> 11:50.020
<b>let's assume that this is a 
genuine wooden trove.</b>

11:50.020 --> 11:53.450
<b>If the contents have been swapped out,</b>

11:53.450 --> 11:56.150
<b>what would you do?</b>

12:02.400 --> 12:05.030
<b>I'll be your slave for the rest of my life.</b>

12:09.920 --> 12:11.310
<b>Give up.</b>

12:24.790 --> 12:27.790
<b>Wow! Awesome!</b>

12:30.280 --> 12:32.560
<b>Oh, so you're Zepile.</b>

12:32.910 --> 12:34.960
<b>Thanks, Zepile-san.</b>

12:34.960 --> 12:36.860
<b>You don't need to thank me.</b>

12:36.860 --> 12:39.010
<b>Consider it give and take.</b>

12:39.010 --> 12:40.320
<b>Twenty percent sounds fair.</b>

12:40.540 --> 12:41.120
<b>Huh?</b>

12:41.120 --> 12:44.030
<b>My cut when you sell the treasure.</b>

12:44.030 --> 12:44.860
<b>What?</b>

12:44.860 --> 12:46.700
<b>You're going to rob us?!</b>

12:46.700 --> 12:48.910
<b>That's uncalled for.</b>

12:48.910 --> 12:51.450
<b>It's my fee for providing advice.</b>

12:51.860 --> 12:53.120
<b>I don't see a problem.</b>

12:53.120 --> 12:54.990
<b>He helped us back there.</b>

12:54.990 --> 12:56.460
<b>Now, look here...</b>

12:57.020 --> 13:01.060
<b>We need to collect as much 
Jenny as we possibly can.</b>

13:01.060 --> 13:03.360
<b>I might be willing to buy him lunch.</b>

13:03.360 --> 13:04.300
<b>Really?</b>

13:04.300 --> 13:05.970
<b>Then I'll settle for that.</b>

13:06.290 --> 13:07.220
<b>Huh?</b>

13:11.610 --> 13:13.230
<b>So, Zepile-san...</b>

13:13.230 --> 13:14.270
<b>Hmm?</b>

13:14.270 --> 13:16.960
<b>I feel bad, so we'll pay you a fee.</b>

13:16.960 --> 13:18.610
<b>There you go again!</b>

13:18.610 --> 13:21.180
<b>Nah, it really is okay.</b>

13:21.180 --> 13:23.480
<b>In return, just tell me something.</b>

13:23.480 --> 13:27.110
<b>What tipped you off to bid on these items?</b>

13:28.490 --> 13:30.940
<b>Is it okay to tell him the truth?</b>

13:30.940 --> 13:33.370
<b>Well, it beats paying him.</b>

13:34.520 --> 13:36.870
<b>I see, <i>Nen</i> aura...</b>

13:37.870 --> 13:39.680
<b>If you're telling the truth,</b>

13:39.680 --> 13:42.150
<b>that explains why you bought the statue,</b>

13:42.150 --> 13:46.130
<b>not realizing something was hidden inside.</b>

13:46.750 --> 13:49.890
<b>So, why do you need money so badly?</b>

13:50.320 --> 13:53.280
<b>We can answer that question, 
but not for free.</b>

13:53.280 --> 13:55.670
<b>Afterwards, you have to answer our question.</b>

13:55.670 --> 13:57.270
<b>Sure, that's fine.</b>

13:58.010 --> 14:01.360
<b>There's an item we want 
to buy at the auction.</b>

14:01.360 --> 14:02.520
<b>That's why we need money.</b>

14:02.520 --> 14:04.990
<b>Oh, which item are you interested in?</b>

14:04.990 --> 14:06.900
<b>It's our turn now.</b>

14:07.230 --> 14:11.460
<b>You estimated that this treasure 
was worth 300 million, right?</b>

14:12.080 --> 14:15.290
<b>Could we receive that much 
at the trade market?</b>

14:15.590 --> 14:17.370
<b>At the trade market?</b>

14:17.370 --> 14:20.700
<b>They mainly deal in hard cash...</b>

14:20.700 --> 14:24.550
<b>If you show up abruptly, 
you won't get a fair price.</b>

14:24.550 --> 14:25.560
<b>What?</b>

14:25.560 --> 14:26.660
<b>Seriously?</b>

14:27.330 --> 14:29.000
<b>Now it's my turn.</b>

14:29.000 --> 14:30.590
<b>I'll repeat the question.</b>

14:30.590 --> 14:32.960
<b>Which item do you want?</b>

14:32.960 --> 14:35.310
<b>A game called <i>Greed Island</i>.</b>

14:35.310 --> 14:38.310
<b>Oh, that ridiculously expensive game?</b>

14:38.900 --> 14:42.820
<b>How much is that weird pot 
that you bought worth?</b>

14:43.120 --> 14:44.800
<b>Huh? This?</b>

14:45.400 --> 14:47.370
<b>It's garbage.</b>

14:47.370 --> 14:48.700
<b>Nothing at all.</b>

14:50.430 --> 14:53.100
<b>Why do you want that expensive game?</b>

14:53.100 --> 14:55.170
<b>I believe it costs 6 billion?</b>

14:55.170 --> 14:56.950
<b>The asking price is 8.9 billion.</b>

14:56.950 --> 15:00.100
<b>We're looking for his dad.</b>

15:00.100 --> 15:02.960
<b>That game has a clue inside.</b>

15:03.310 --> 15:04.570
<b>Oh...</b>

15:04.570 --> 15:06.530
<b>Why did you choose that pot?</b>

15:07.710 --> 15:10.250
<b>If you knew the wooden trove was real,</b>

15:10.250 --> 15:12.830
<b>shouldn't you have bid on 
the more valuable item?</b>

15:12.830 --> 15:15.220
<b>But you went for the pot.</b>

15:15.530 --> 15:16.350
<b>Why?</b>

15:18.630 --> 15:20.120
<b>You see...</b>

15:20.120 --> 15:22.600
<b>I made this pot.</b>

15:22.910 --> 15:23.860
<b>Huh?</b>

15:24.190 --> 15:26.770
<b>But it wasn't an original creation.</b>

15:27.740 --> 15:29.050
<b>It was a replica.</b>

15:29.050 --> 15:30.860
<b>In other words, a counterfeit.</b>

15:31.420 --> 15:35.160
<b>When I was destitute, 
this was how I made Jenny.</b>

15:35.900 --> 15:39.990
<b>Once I became an appraiser 
and began earning money,</b>

15:39.990 --> 15:41.700
<b>I quit doing that.</b>

15:42.150 --> 15:44.520
<b>When I see how poorly these are made,</b>

15:44.520 --> 15:46.880
<b>I feel mortified!</b>

15:48.520 --> 15:52.630
<b>So I browse the markets and buy them back.</b>

15:53.570 --> 15:55.750
<b>How much would a real one cost?</b>

15:55.750 --> 15:57.580
<b>It's my turn.</b>

15:57.580 --> 16:00.270
<b>What does your dad do?</b>

16:00.270 --> 16:02.140
<b>He's a pro Hunter.</b>

16:02.140 --> 16:04.400
<b>How much would a real one cost?!</b>

16:04.700 --> 16:05.960
<b>Forty to fifty thousand.</b>

16:06.720 --> 16:09.180
<b>Is that so? A pro Hunter, huh?</b>

16:10.160 --> 16:12.860
<b>There are a few in the antiques world,</b>

16:12.860 --> 16:16.030
<b>and not one of them is ordinary.</b>

16:16.370 --> 16:19.950
<b>Won't it be impossible for you 
two to find him alone?</b>

16:19.950 --> 16:22.920
<b>It'll be fine. 
I'm a pro Hunter, too.</b>

16:22.920 --> 16:24.670
<b>Huh? Seriously?</b>

16:25.850 --> 16:28.670
<b>Okay, your turn to ask a question.</b>

16:30.440 --> 16:33.160
<b>Okay, this is my final question.</b>

16:33.960 --> 16:36.930
<b>Can I help you with anything?</b>

16:36.930 --> 16:37.970
<b>Huh?</b>

16:37.970 --> 16:42.690
<b>If you want to make money at an auction, 
you'll need an appraiser.</b>

16:43.010 --> 16:45.710
<b>You could even say that with an appraiser,</b>

16:45.710 --> 16:49.100
<b>you can always turn a profit.</b>

16:49.100 --> 16:52.190
<b>You can set the price you want to pay me.</b>

16:52.450 --> 16:53.110
<b>How's that?</b>

16:54.840 --> 16:57.450
<b>Then you have to answer our last question.</b>

16:57.850 --> 17:01.300
<b>Why do you want to help us?</b>

17:06.070 --> 17:07.720
<b>Because it made me happy...</b>

17:08.670 --> 17:11.350
<b>It made me happy that this piece of junk</b>

17:11.350 --> 17:13.840
<b>actually caught your eye.</b>

17:14.430 --> 17:15.720
<b>It's not a piece of junk!</b>

17:16.610 --> 17:20.470
<b>It definitely holds your <i>Nen</i>.</b>

17:20.950 --> 17:23.850
<b>Everyone has some aura...</b>

17:23.850 --> 17:27.480
<b>But it's incredibly difficult to harness!</b>

17:27.990 --> 17:31.430
<b>You must concentrate and 
train for a very long time.</b>

17:31.430 --> 17:35.860
<b>I can tell how much effort you 
put into making that pot!</b>

17:36.960 --> 17:38.820
<b>You have a lot of talent!</b>

17:39.950 --> 17:42.870
<b>I still think it's a weird pot, though.</b>

17:46.350 --> 17:48.880
<b>My eyes didn't deceive me.</b>

17:49.740 --> 17:51.710
<b>When you appraise objects long enough,</b>

17:51.710 --> 17:54.880
<b>you also become a good judge of character.</b>

17:55.340 --> 17:59.530
<b>I look at the sellers and the buyers too, 
not just the merchandise.</b>

18:00.140 --> 18:04.070
<b>It's a lot harder to appraise humans</b>

18:04.070 --> 18:06.730
<b>than it is to appraise antiques.</b>

18:07.580 --> 18:11.580
<b>When I saw you, I knew right away...</b>

18:12.140 --> 18:15.400
<b>That I wanted to work with you.</b>

18:15.400 --> 18:17.290
<b>That's my answer.</b>

18:17.290 --> 18:18.590
<b>What's yours?</b>

18:21.640 --> 18:22.940
<b>Looking forward to it.</b>

18:22.940 --> 18:25.660
<b>We'll decide your fee after 
we see how you do.</b>

18:27.160 --> 18:29.470
<b>Okay! With that settled...</b>

18:29.470 --> 18:30.680
<b>But first...</b>

18:30.680 --> 18:31.290
<b>Huh?</b>

18:31.680 --> 18:33.200
<b>Teach me those techniques</b>

18:33.200 --> 18:35.300
<b>you talked about earlier.</b>

18:36.110 --> 18:37.440
<b>You're interested?</b>

18:37.440 --> 18:38.180
<b>Yep!</b>

18:38.440 --> 18:41.900
<b>Hoodwinking, double-dipping, welding...</b>

18:41.900 --> 18:43.710
<b>What else is there?</b>

18:43.710 --> 18:44.850
<b>Seriously...</b>

18:44.850 --> 18:46.680
<b>That isn't important at all!</b>

18:46.680 --> 18:49.680
<b>But they sound fun! 
Like magic tricks!</b>

18:49.680 --> 18:51.750
<b>We're not here to have fun!</b>

18:53.240 --> 18:58.200
<b><i>Now I understand why this kid interests me.</i></b>

18:58.830 --> 19:02.200
<b><i>He doesn't care about right or wrong.</i></b>

19:02.810 --> 19:05.950
<b><i>When I admitted to making forgeries</i></b>

19:06.220 --> 19:09.960
<b><i>and when that trader gave me a hard time...</i></b>

19:10.600 --> 19:13.020
<b><i>He didn't react with accusatory glares</i></b>

19:13.020 --> 19:15.460
<b><i>or by plotting his own evil deeds.</i></b>

19:16.330 --> 19:18.210
<b><i>His reaction was very simple.</i></b>

19:18.740 --> 19:20.360
<b><i>Innocent curiosity!</i></b>

19:21.020 --> 19:25.720
<b><i>He opens his mind to everything that 
impresses him, right or wrong.</i></b>

19:26.640 --> 19:29.730
<b><i>Which means that he's dangerous...</i></b>

19:30.430 --> 19:35.090
<b><i>Someone who can never truly be appraised.</i></b>

19:39.060 --> 19:43.740
<b>Welding is the hardest 
technique to see through.</b>

19:44.640 --> 19:48.480
<b>But recently, a new technique has surfaced.</b>

19:48.480 --> 19:50.750
<b>It's known as exposing.</b>

19:52.340 --> 19:55.520
<b>You plainly reveal the opened statue</b>

19:55.520 --> 19:57.500
<b>along with a fake treasure.</b>

19:58.080 --> 20:00.130
<b>Because people assume</b>

20:00.130 --> 20:04.110
<b>that you wouldn't open the statue 
if the treasure were fake,</b>

20:04.110 --> 20:06.010
<b>you can fool them.</b>

20:06.610 --> 20:09.270
<b>But now this technique is getting old.</b>

20:09.640 --> 20:13.710
<b>When people started to get suspicious, 
a new technique emerged.</b>

20:14.660 --> 20:17.020
<b>Can you guess what it is?</b>

20:17.020 --> 20:18.340
<b>I know.</b>

20:18.340 --> 20:21.220
<b>The treasure inside is also fake!</b>

20:21.220 --> 20:22.260
<b>Wrong!</b>

20:23.100 --> 20:24.300
<b>I know!</b>

20:24.300 --> 20:26.410
<b>Remove the treasure from a different place!</b>

20:26.410 --> 20:27.760
<b>Bingo!</b>

20:29.360 --> 20:34.510
<b>You can create a new opening 
and remove the treasure,</b>

20:34.510 --> 20:37.270
<b>then insert the fake 
treasure and seal the hole.</b>

20:37.860 --> 20:40.170
<b>This is known as side-stepping.</b>

20:40.170 --> 20:41.610
<b>Side-stepping...</b>

20:42.090 --> 20:44.990
<b>Many veteran appraisers have been fooled.</b>

20:45.640 --> 20:49.280
<b>They assume the statue is real if the 
adhesive hasn't changed color</b>

20:49.280 --> 20:50.810
<b>from the application of fire.</b>

20:51.270 --> 20:53.760
<b>That's how they fool the pros.</b>

20:56.380 --> 20:58.250
<b>You live in an incredible world.</b>

21:00.300 --> 21:01.500
<b>Hello?</b>

21:02.410 --> 21:04.070
<b>What? A spider?</b>

21:04.450 --> 21:06.570
<b>Yeah, this looks real.</b>

21:07.040 --> 21:08.970
<b>There's a video attached.</b>

21:08.970 --> 21:10.200
<b>We have two targets.</b>

21:10.840 --> 21:12.200
<b>A man and a woman.</b>

21:12.540 --> 21:15.550
<b>I'll leave now, so let's meet there.</b>

21:15.550 --> 21:16.710
<b>Got it.</b>

21:17.240 --> 21:18.680
<b>Let's go, Killua.</b>

21:18.680 --> 21:19.480
<b>Yeah.</b>

21:20.270 --> 21:22.720
<b>Hey! What about the auction?</b>

21:23.840 --> 21:25.160
<b>We'll let you handle it!</b>

21:25.160 --> 21:26.970
<b>Try to get us a good price!</b>

21:26.970 --> 21:28.220
<b>Huh?</b>

21:32.140 --> 21:34.230
<b>Okay! I've got it covered!</b>

21:39.640 --> 21:43.750
<b>Gon and Killua have learned 
about a whole new world.</b>

21:45.490 --> 21:49.280
<b>And they are about to make 
contact with the Phantom Troupe.</b>

23:01.230 --> 23:06.280
<b>Brush Your Teeth.

<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.650 --> 23:05.300

<b>Today, we introduce Shizuku.</b>

<b>A Phantom Troupe member.</b>

23:11.340 --> 23:12.320
<b>A member of the Phantom Troupe.</b>

23:12.320 --> 23:14.190
<b>She can conjure the vacuum cleaner Blinky.</b>

23:12.740 --> 23:20.000
<b>Conjurer who uses a conjured 
vacuum named Blinky.</b>

23:14.190 --> 23:15.620
<b>But it can't suck up anything alive.</b>

23:15.620 --> 23:17.120
<b>Its capacity is immeasurable!</b>

23:17.120 --> 23:18.910
<b>Where do you go if you're sucked in?</b>

23:18.910 --> 23:20.290
<b>No one knows.</b>

23:24.710 --> 23:26.960
<b>Next Time: Pursuit x And x Analysis.</b>

<b>Right or left?</b>

<b>Right.</b>

23:29.090 --> 23:30.970
<b>Do we go after the man or the woman?</b>

23:30.970 --> 23:31.970
<b>The woman.</b>

23:31.970 --> 23:33.140
<b>Should I use red or blue?</b>

23:33.140 --> 23:34.850
<b>You can decide that for yourself!</b>
