05:09.618 --> 05:14.498
If we look at the base of a brain
which has just been removed from a skull,

05:14.623 --> 05:18.752
there's very little of the midbrain
that we can actually see.

05:18.835 --> 05:22.089
Yet, as I demonstrated
in my lecture last week,

05:22.214 --> 05:28.304
if the under aspects of the temporal lobes
are gently pulled apart,

05:29.263 --> 05:33.184
the upper portion of the stem
of the brain can be seen.

05:33.935 --> 05:38.690
This so-called brainstem
consists of the midbrain,

05:40.191 --> 05:44.237
a rounded protrusion called the pons,

05:45.321 --> 05:49.450
and a stalk tapering downwards
called the medulla oblongata

05:49.575 --> 05:53.329
which passes out of the skull
through the foramen magnum

05:53.454 --> 05:56.542
and becomes, of course, the spinal cord.

05:57.293 --> 05:59.962
Are there any questions before we proceed?

06:00.087 --> 06:02.381
I have one question, Dr Frankenstein.

06:05.217 --> 06:07.386
That's Fronkonsteen.

06:07.511 --> 06:09.471
I beg your pardon?

06:09.805 --> 06:13.392
My name. It's pronounced "Fronkonsteen".

06:13.517 --> 06:17.313
But aren't you the grandson
of the famous Dr Victor Frankenstein,

06:17.438 --> 06:22.401
who dug up freshly buried corpses
and transformed dead components into...

06:22.526 --> 06:24.153
Yes, yes.

06:24.278 --> 06:25.363
Yes.

06:25.488 --> 06:27.532
We all know what he did.

06:28.491 --> 06:33.204
But I'd rather be remembered
for my own small contributions to science

06:34.164 --> 06:37.667
and not because of my accidental
relationship

06:37.751 --> 06:41.087
to a famous... cuckoo.

06:45.091 --> 06:47.761
Now, if you don't mind,
can we have your question?

06:47.886 --> 06:51.598
Well, sir, I'm not sure
I understand the distinction between

06:51.723 --> 06:54.392
reflexive and voluntary nerve impulses.

06:54.476 --> 06:58.689
Good. Since our lab work today
is a demonstration of just that distinction,

06:58.814 --> 07:01.275
why don't we proceed?

07:10.618 --> 07:13.955
Mr Hilltop here,
with whom I have never worked

07:14.080 --> 07:16.916
or given any prior instructions to,

07:16.999 --> 07:20.962
has graciously offered his services
for today's demonstration.

07:21.629 --> 07:26.009
Mr Hilltop, would you hop up on your feet
and stand beside this table?

07:35.852 --> 07:37.896
Nice hopping.

07:40.065 --> 07:42.109
Mr Hilltop,

07:42.567 --> 07:47.364
would you raise your left knee, please?

07:50.409 --> 07:53.745
You have just witnessed
a voluntary nerve impulse.

07:53.829 --> 07:56.916
It begins as a stimulus
from the cerebral cortex,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.503
passes through the brainstem
and to the muscles involved.

08:00.586 --> 08:02.880
Mr Hilltop, you may lower your knee.

08:03.006 --> 08:08.219
Reflex movements are those
which are made independently of the will,

08:08.344 --> 08:10.555
but are carried out along pathways

08:10.680 --> 08:15.143
which pass between the peripheral nervous
system and the central nervous system.

08:15.268 --> 08:18.521
You filthy, rotten, yellow son of a bitch.

08:18.605 --> 08:21.357
We are not aware of these impulses.

08:21.482 --> 08:25.361
Neither do we intend them
to carry out our contraction of muscles.

08:25.487 --> 08:27.948
Yet, as you can see, they work by themselves.

08:28.073 --> 08:32.369
But what if we block the nerve impulse
by simply applying local pressure,

08:32.494 --> 08:35.496
which can be done
with any ordinary metal clamp

08:35.623 --> 08:40.085
just at the swelling
on the posterior nerve roots

08:41.462 --> 08:45.090
for, say... five or six seconds?

08:50.012 --> 08:52.306
Why, you mother-grabbing bastard.

08:53.515 --> 08:56.519
As you can see,
all communication is shut off.

08:59.898 --> 09:02.817
In spite of our mechanical magnificence,

09:03.526 --> 09:08.531
if it were not for this continuous stream
of motor impulses,

09:08.657 --> 09:10.700
we would collapse

09:10.825 --> 09:14.162
like a bunch of broccoli.

09:19.501 --> 09:21.878
In conclusion, it should be noted...

09:22.504 --> 09:25.423
- Give him an extra dollar.
- Extra dollar. Yes, sir.

09:25.548 --> 09:28.469
...that any more than common injury

09:28.552 --> 09:31.305
to the nerve root is always serious.

09:32.014 --> 09:35.267
Because once a nerve fibre is severed,

09:35.351 --> 09:38.854
there is no way, in heaven or on earth,

09:39.855 --> 09:42.692
to regenerate life back into it.

09:42.817 --> 09:45.736
Are there any last questions before we leave?

09:45.861 --> 09:47.822
Dr Frank...

09:47.947 --> 09:50.324
- Fronkonsteen...
- Yes?

09:50.449 --> 09:54.829
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved
a piece of vermicelli in a glass case

09:54.912 --> 09:57.165
until, by some extraordinary means,

09:57.291 --> 10:00.877
it actually began to move
with a voluntary motion?

10:01.586 --> 10:05.340
Are you speaking of the worm
or the spaghetti?

10:06.758 --> 10:08.802
Why, the worm, sir.

10:08.927 --> 10:13.473
Yes. It seems to me I did read something
of that incident when I was a student.

10:13.598 --> 10:17.185
But you have to remember that a worm,
with very few exceptions,

10:17.311 --> 10:20.314
is not a human being.

10:21.106 --> 10:24.359
But wasn't that the basis
of your grandfather's work, sir?

10:24.484 --> 10:26.529
The reanimation of dead tissue?

10:26.654 --> 10:30.241
My grandfather was a very sick man.

10:30.366 --> 10:34.579
But as a Fronkonsteen,
aren't you the least bit curious about it?

10:34.704 --> 10:39.083
Doesn't bringing back to life what was
once dead hold any intrigue for you?

10:39.208 --> 10:45.798
You are talking about the nonsensical ravings
of a lunatic mind. Dead is dead.

10:45.923 --> 10:48.760
But look at what has been done
with hearts and kidneys.

10:48.843 --> 10:54.349
Hearts and kidneys are Tinkertoys.
I'm talking about the central nervous system.

10:54.474 --> 10:57.811
- But, sir...
- I am a scientist, not a philosopher!

10:57.895 --> 11:00.731
You have more chance
of reanimating this scalpel

11:00.814 --> 11:03.067
than of mending a broken nervous system.

11:03.192 --> 11:08.113
- But what about your grandfather's work?
- My grandfather's work was doo-doo!

11:10.032 --> 11:12.117
I am not interested in death.

11:12.242 --> 11:15.955
The only thing that concerns me
is the preservation of life!

11:23.921 --> 11:25.798
Class...

11:25.923 --> 11:27.634
...is...

11:27.717 --> 11:29.761
...dismissed.

11:38.728 --> 11:40.772
Dr Frankenstein...

11:42.148 --> 11:44.401
That's Fronkonsteen.

11:47.946 --> 11:50.365
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.

11:50.490 --> 11:55.912
I have travelled 5,000 miles to bring you
the will of your great-grandfather.

11:55.996 --> 12:00.710
Baron Beaufort von Frankenstein.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.684
Oh, my sweet darling.

12:16.809 --> 12:20.855
Oh, my dearest love.
I'll count the hours that you're away.

12:20.938 --> 12:24.859
- Oh, darling, so will I.
- Not on the lips.

12:24.984 --> 12:29.364
I'm going to that party at Nanna and Nicky's.
I don't wanna smear my lipstick.

12:29.489 --> 12:31.199
- You understand.
- Of course.

12:31.283 --> 12:32.826
All aboard!

12:33.577 --> 12:36.496
- Oh, dear.
- Well, I guess this is it.

12:36.622 --> 12:38.582
Freddy, darling.

12:38.707 --> 12:43.003
Oh, how can I say in a few minutes
what it's taken me a lifetime to understand?

12:43.086 --> 12:45.130
- Won't you try?
- All right.

12:46.089 --> 12:48.133
You've got it, mister.

12:48.759 --> 12:52.220
I'm yours. All of me. What else can I say?

12:52.346 --> 12:55.515
- My sweet love...
- The hair. Just been set.

12:55.641 --> 12:57.602
Sorry.

12:58.311 --> 13:02.857
- I hope you like old-fashioned weddings.
- I prefer old-fashioned wedding nights.

13:02.982 --> 13:06.611
- You're incorrigible.
- Does that mean...

13:08.488 --> 13:11.741
...you love me?
- You bet your boots it does.

13:11.824 --> 13:15.453
- Oh, my only love.
- Taffeta, darling.

13:15.912 --> 13:17.872
Taffeta, sweetheart.

13:17.956 --> 13:22.502
No, the dress is taffeta. It wrinkles so easily.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.087
All aboard!

13:24.212 --> 13:26.422
There's that horrid man again.

13:26.547 --> 13:29.468
Well, hurry now,
before I make a fool of myself.

13:29.551 --> 13:31.595
Oh, my nails!

13:31.720 --> 13:33.764
Sorry.

13:41.271 --> 13:43.774
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Freddy.

13:49.446 --> 13:50.906
Darling.

14:14.264 --> 14:17.726
- Harry, he was at it again.
- So what do you want me to do about it?

14:17.851 --> 14:19.311
Every day.

14:19.394 --> 14:21.187
Let him. Let him.

14:21.313 --> 14:25.108
New York next. Everybody out for New York.

14:52.011 --> 14:55.264
Pardon me, boy.
Is this the Transylvania Station?

14:56.432 --> 14:58.644
<i>Ja, ja. Track 29.</i>

15:00.187 --> 15:02.230
Oh, can I give you a shine?

15:03.774 --> 15:05.817
No, thanks.

15:33.179 --> 15:35.223
Dr Frankenstein?

15:40.520 --> 15:41.980
Fronkonsteen.

15:43.940 --> 15:45.984
You're putting me on.

15:46.109 --> 15:48.403
No. It's pronounced Fronkonsteen.

15:49.362 --> 15:51.739
Do you also say Frodorick?

15:51.864 --> 15:53.908
No. Frederick.

15:54.033 --> 15:57.203
Well, why isn't it Frodorick Fronkonsteen?

15:57.328 --> 15:59.915
It isn't. It's Frederick Fronkonsteen.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.293
I see.

16:02.418 --> 16:05.921
- You must be lgor.
- No. It's pronounced I-gor.

16:07.423 --> 16:11.635
- But they told me it was lgor.
- Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?

16:12.636 --> 16:15.139
<i>You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?</i>

16:15.264 --> 16:19.226
Yes. My grandfather
used to work for your grandfather.

16:22.187 --> 16:25.274
- How nice.
- Of course, the rates have gone up.

16:25.357 --> 16:29.070
Of course. I'm sure we'll get along splendidly.

16:30.613 --> 16:33.283
Sorry. I...

16:34.034 --> 16:38.246
You know, I don't mean to embarrass you,
but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.832
Perhaps I could help you with that hump.

16:40.957 --> 16:43.001
What hump?

16:47.631 --> 16:49.591
Let's go.

16:49.674 --> 16:52.844
Allow me, master.

16:52.969 --> 16:55.013
Thanks very much.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.354
Walk this way.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.232
This way.

17:22.791 --> 17:26.127
I think you'll be more comfortable in the rear.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.846
- What was that?
- That'll be Inga.

17:34.972 --> 17:39.267
<i>Herr Falkstein thought you might need
a laboratory assistant temporarily.</i>

17:43.689 --> 17:47.192
Hello.
Would you like to have a roll in the hay?

17:48.610 --> 17:50.237
It's fun.

17:50.362 --> 17:53.865
Roll, roll, roll in the hay

18:16.931 --> 18:19.434
Sometimes I am afraid of the lightning.

18:19.559 --> 18:21.936
It's just an atmospheric discharge.

18:22.061 --> 18:24.105
Nothing to be afraid of.

18:29.528 --> 18:31.572
Werewolf.

18:31.697 --> 18:33.741
Werewolf?

18:33.866 --> 18:35.909
- There.
- What?

18:36.785 --> 18:38.829
There wolf.

18:38.954 --> 18:40.998
There castle.

18:41.123 --> 18:43.167
Why are you talking that way?

18:43.292 --> 18:46.211
- I thought you wanted to.
- No, I don't want to.

18:47.171 --> 18:49.214
Suit yourself. I'm easy.

18:52.509 --> 18:54.053
Well...

18:54.136 --> 18:55.929
There it is.

18:56.013 --> 18:58.057
Home.

19:30.508 --> 19:32.718
What knockers.

19:33.844 --> 19:35.846
Thank you, Doctor.

19:35.972 --> 19:38.432
Oh, that's all right.

19:39.433 --> 19:41.227
There we are.

19:54.073 --> 19:56.659
<i>I am Frau Blücher.</i>

20:00.956 --> 20:03.000
Steady!

20:04.584 --> 20:07.254
How do you do? I am Dr Fronkonsteen.

20:07.379 --> 20:11.008
<i>This is my assistant.
Inga, may I present Frau Blücher?</i>

20:14.636 --> 20:17.389
I wonder what's got into them.

20:17.472 --> 20:22.102
<i>Your rooms have been prepared, Herr Doktor.</i>

20:22.227 --> 20:24.896
If you will follow me.

20:24.980 --> 20:28.066
I-gor. Would you bring the bags
as soon as you're finished, please?

20:28.191 --> 20:29.652
Yes, master.

20:29.777 --> 20:32.238
<i>After you, Frau Blücher.</i>

20:47.211 --> 20:49.422
Blücher!

21:06.148 --> 21:08.734
Follow me, please.

21:29.798 --> 21:31.841
Stay close to the candles.

21:31.967 --> 21:35.553
The staircase can be treacherous.

21:44.104 --> 21:48.650
<i>Und this is your room.
It was your grandfather Victor's room.</i>

21:48.775 --> 21:50.819
I see.

21:52.070 --> 21:54.197
Well. Seem to be quite a few books.

21:54.364 --> 21:56.408
This was Victor's...

21:57.033 --> 22:00.037
...the Baron's medical library.

22:00.121 --> 22:04.333
- Where is my grandfather's private library?
- I don't know what you mean, sir.

22:04.458 --> 22:08.587
Well, these books are very general.
Any doctor might have them in his study.

22:08.713 --> 22:12.842
This is the only library I know of,
Dr Frankenstone.

22:13.759 --> 22:16.178
- Fronkonsteen.
- Fronkonsteen.

22:16.971 --> 22:19.432
Well, we'll see.

22:20.349 --> 22:22.393
Good night.

22:24.729 --> 22:28.232
Would the doctor care for
a brandy before retiring?

22:29.192 --> 22:31.862
No. Thank you.

22:34.031 --> 22:36.074
Some warm milk...

22:37.117 --> 22:38.994
...perhaps?

22:39.828 --> 22:42.581
No, thank you very much.

22:42.706 --> 22:44.833
No, thanks.

22:44.916 --> 22:46.960
Ovaltine?

22:51.340 --> 22:53.133
Nothing.

22:53.258 --> 22:55.052
Thank you.

22:55.177 --> 22:57.554
I'm a little tired.

23:00.475 --> 23:02.602
Then I will say... good night.

23:02.727 --> 23:04.771
Good night!

23:20.995 --> 23:23.915
Good night, darling.

23:27.377 --> 23:29.505
<i>Good night, Herr Doktor.</i>

23:29.630 --> 23:32.007
<i>Good night, Frau Blücher.</i>

23:53.612 --> 23:55.656
No, no, no...

23:57.157 --> 23:59.619
No, no, no...

24:04.040 --> 24:06.418
I'm not a Frankenstein.

24:07.669 --> 24:09.921
I am not a Frankenstein.

24:11.381 --> 24:13.425
I'm a Fronkonsteen.

24:14.217 --> 24:16.261
Don't gimme that!

24:16.386 --> 24:19.139
I don't believe in fate.

24:19.889 --> 24:21.933
And I won't say it.

24:23.351 --> 24:25.895
All right, you win. I give.

24:26.062 --> 24:28.606
I'll say it. I'll say it, I'll say it.

24:30.651 --> 24:32.862
Destiny. Destiny.

24:33.446 --> 24:35.823
No escaping that for me.

24:35.948 --> 24:38.075
Destiny. Destiny.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.536
No escaping that for me.

24:40.661 --> 24:42.872
Destiny. Destiny...

24:42.955 --> 24:44.999
No escaping...

24:46.709 --> 24:49.295
Dr Fronkonsteen. Wake up.

24:50.087 --> 24:53.841
- What is it?
- You were having a nightmare.

24:55.843 --> 24:58.846
- What's that strange music?
- I have no idea.

25:00.182 --> 25:02.225
But it seems to be coming

25:03.393 --> 25:05.812
from behind the bookcase.

25:07.397 --> 25:09.983
Behind the bookcase...

25:11.652 --> 25:13.862
Hand me that robe, would you, dear?

25:18.700 --> 25:21.953
You were right.
It's coming from behind this wall.

25:22.871 --> 25:24.331
Where is it?

25:24.456 --> 25:26.416
- Where is it?
- What?

25:26.500 --> 25:30.630
There's always a device.
If I can just spot the triggering mechanism...

25:30.713 --> 25:32.757
Hello.

25:43.184 --> 25:47.313
It seems louder over here.
Hand me that candle, will you?

25:51.734 --> 25:54.988
Put the candle back.

26:01.203 --> 26:05.332
All right. I think I have it figured out now.

26:05.416 --> 26:10.838
Take out the candle
and I'll block the bookcase with my body.

26:21.265 --> 26:24.018
Listen to me very carefully.

26:24.101 --> 26:27.354
Don't put the candle back.

26:27.938 --> 26:29.898
With all of your might,

26:30.024 --> 26:33.820
shove against the other side
of the bookcase.

26:34.321 --> 26:36.906
Is that perfectly clear?

26:38.158 --> 26:40.201
I think so.

26:48.752 --> 26:50.795
Good girl.

26:51.921 --> 26:55.008
Put the candle back.

27:02.391 --> 27:04.894
Oh, look, Doctor. A passageway.

27:05.019 --> 27:08.105
Whatever that music is,
it's coming from down there.

27:08.189 --> 27:11.817
- I'd better take a look.
- Oh, let me come with you, Doctor, please.

27:11.942 --> 27:13.986
I don't wanna stay up here alone.

27:14.111 --> 27:17.114
All right, then.
Close your robe and follow me.

27:17.239 --> 27:19.283
Oh, Doctor. The candle...

27:20.117 --> 27:22.787
Good thinking. Let's try this one.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.123
Stand back!

27:59.449 --> 28:01.911
Don't be frightened, dear. Just a rat.

28:02.704 --> 28:05.123
A filthy, slimy rat.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.203
Good Lord!

29:02.766 --> 29:04.476
I-I-I-I-I-I

29:04.559 --> 29:06.936
Ain't got nobody

29:07.062 --> 29:10.482
And nobody cares for me

29:11.941 --> 29:13.485
- I-gor.
- Frodorick.

29:13.568 --> 29:15.612
How did you get here?

29:17.238 --> 29:21.201
Through the dumbwaiter. I heard
strange music from the upstairs kitchen

29:21.326 --> 29:23.620
and I just followed it down.

29:23.745 --> 29:26.831
Call it... a hunch.

29:27.374 --> 29:31.504
- There must have been someone else here.
- It would seem that way.

29:31.587 --> 29:34.423
And there's the only other door.

29:34.548 --> 29:36.592
Wait, master.

29:36.717 --> 29:38.761
It might be dangerous.

29:39.637 --> 29:41.681
You go first.

29:53.067 --> 29:55.528
Aren't there any lights in this place?

29:56.612 --> 30:01.243
Two nasty-looking switches over here,
but I'm not going to be the first.

30:06.415 --> 30:08.458
Damn your eyes.

30:08.583 --> 30:10.627
Too late.

30:23.473 --> 30:26.560
So this is where it all happened.

30:37.697 --> 30:42.493
<i>Just think. A dead brain
ready to live again in a new body.</i>

30:43.119 --> 30:46.122
<i>Look. No blood, no decomposition.</i>

30:46.205 --> 30:48.249
<i>Just a few sutures.</i>

30:48.374 --> 30:51.044
<i>- Throw the main switch.
- Yes, master.</i>

30:57.884 --> 31:00.219
What a filthy mess.

31:00.345 --> 31:04.141
I dunno. A little paint, a few flowers,
couple of throw pillows...

31:08.228 --> 31:12.941
Well, it seems as if our mysterious violinist
has disa... p...

31:13.067 --> 31:15.819
- Disa... what?
...peared.

31:15.944 --> 31:19.657
There is a light
coming from behind that door.

31:22.076 --> 31:24.119
Follow me.

31:51.940 --> 31:53.984
Doctor, look!

31:55.860 --> 31:59.489
Well... This explains the music.

32:01.074 --> 32:03.035
It's still warm.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.121
But who was playing it?

32:05.246 --> 32:06.789
I don't know.

32:06.914 --> 32:10.710
But whoever it was just barely finished
putting out his cigar.

32:10.835 --> 32:13.504
Such strange goings-on.

32:15.965 --> 32:18.009
What is this place?

32:18.134 --> 32:20.594
Music room?

32:20.720 --> 32:23.723
But there's nothing here
but books and papers.

32:24.265 --> 32:26.309
Books and papers?

32:27.184 --> 32:28.644
It is!

32:28.728 --> 32:32.107
This is my grandfather's private library.
I feel it.

32:33.567 --> 32:35.610
Look! Look at this.

32:50.042 --> 32:55.047
"...until, from the midst of this
darkness, a sudden light broke in upon me."

32:56.089 --> 33:00.552
"A light so brilliant and wondrous,
and yet so simple."

33:01.678 --> 33:04.182
"Change the poles from plus to minus

33:05.266 --> 33:08.186
and from minus to plus."

33:11.939 --> 33:16.235
"I alone succeeded in discovering
the secret of bestowing life."

33:16.903 --> 33:18.780
"Nay, even more..."

33:18.905 --> 33:24.160
"I myself became capable
of bestowing animation

33:25.036 --> 33:27.413
upon lifeless matter."

33:34.630 --> 33:37.883
It could work.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.153
- Kipper?
- Thank you, Doctor.

34:03.827 --> 34:07.163
"As the minuteness of the parts
formed a hindrance to my speed,

34:07.247 --> 34:12.918
I resolved therefore
to make the creature of a gigantic stature."

34:15.547 --> 34:17.257
Of course.

34:17.382 --> 34:19.509
That would simplify everything.

34:19.634 --> 34:21.261
In other words,

34:21.344 --> 34:26.224
his veins, his feet, his hands, his organs
would all have to be increased in size.

34:26.306 --> 34:28.268
Exactly.

34:29.143 --> 34:31.896
<i>He would have an enormous Schwanzstück.</i>

34:37.862 --> 34:40.072
That goes without saying.

34:40.197 --> 34:41.657
Woof.

34:42.658 --> 34:45.161
He's gonna be very popular.

34:46.036 --> 34:51.542
So then. What we're aiming for is a being
approximately seven feet in height,

34:51.625 --> 34:56.589
with all features either congenitally
or artificially proportionate in size.

34:56.714 --> 34:58.591
Something like...

34:59.050 --> 35:01.177
...this?

35:05.390 --> 35:07.184
Hello...

35:07.309 --> 35:09.353
You've caught something there.

35:09.478 --> 35:13.065
Crude, yes, primitive, yes,
perhaps even grotesque,

35:13.190 --> 35:15.942
yet something inexplicable tells me

35:16.818 --> 35:21.114
that this might be our man.

35:37.256 --> 35:39.300
All right, all right.

35:39.425 --> 35:41.928
That's good enough for the likes of 'im.

35:58.987 --> 36:01.030
Get down, you fool.

36:09.456 --> 36:11.500
Now.

36:40.530 --> 36:42.574
What a filthy job.

36:43.074 --> 36:45.368
- Could be worse.
- How?

36:45.493 --> 36:47.537
Could be raining.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.005
Quick.

37:41.385 --> 37:43.345
Need a hand?

37:43.428 --> 37:47.015
No, thanks. I have one.
Thanks very much all the same.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.850
Just a moment, sir.

37:48.934 --> 37:52.771
I know everyone around here,
but I've never seen your face before.

37:52.896 --> 37:54.940
Can you account for yourself?

37:55.065 --> 37:59.194
Yes. I am Dr Frederick Fronkonsteen,
newly arrived from America.

37:59.319 --> 38:01.989
Oh, yes, sir. I was told you were here.

38:02.114 --> 38:05.368
Well, I'm Constable Henry, sir.
Pleased to meet you.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.497
How very nice to meet you, Constable.

38:09.622 --> 38:12.625
Why, you're chilled to the bone, sir.

38:12.750 --> 38:15.753
A nice, warm fire would be the thing for you.

38:15.878 --> 38:19.298
A little nip from the old bottle
wouldn't be too bad either, sir.

38:19.382 --> 38:21.634
That's the ticket, yes.

38:21.759 --> 38:25.304
Well, if you have everything in hand, sir,
I'll say good night.

38:25.430 --> 38:27.473
Thank you very much, Constable.

38:27.598 --> 38:30.601
At your service, sir, always.

38:32.520 --> 38:35.274
- Good night, Constable.
- Good night, sir.

38:52.708 --> 38:55.544
Oh, what an awesome sight.

38:56.962 --> 39:00.674
What a profound and reverend night is this.

39:02.009 --> 39:04.346
With such a specimen for a body,

39:04.971 --> 39:09.351
all we need now is
an equally magnificent brain.

39:11.353 --> 39:14.272
- You know what to do?
- I have a pretty good idea.

39:14.397 --> 39:16.441
Good man.

39:17.150 --> 39:20.487
Didn't you... Didn't you use to have that
on the other side?

39:20.612 --> 39:22.656
- What?
- Your...

39:23.615 --> 39:25.659
Never mind.

39:29.371 --> 39:32.999
- Do you have that name I gave you?
- I have it written down.

39:34.210 --> 39:38.589
- H Delbruck.
- Hans Delbruck.

41:31.288 --> 41:35.043
- He is hideous.
- He's beautiful.

41:36.211 --> 41:39.673
And he is mine.

41:47.681 --> 41:50.517
Hurry now.
We're fighting time and the elements.

41:50.642 --> 41:54.688
- Are you ready?
- Are you sure this is how they did it?

41:54.813 --> 41:57.399
Yes. It's all written down in the notes.

41:57.524 --> 42:00.610
Now tie off the kites
and hurry down as fast as you can.

42:00.735 --> 42:02.195
What's the hurry?

42:02.320 --> 42:06.242
There's a possibility of electrocution.
Do you understand?

42:10.079 --> 42:13.958
I say: "There's a possibility of electrocution."

42:14.542 --> 42:16.961
Do you understand?

42:17.086 --> 42:20.089
I understand, I understand.
Why are you shouting?

42:21.298 --> 42:22.925
Did you...

42:23.926 --> 42:26.846
- Did you tie off the kites?
- Of course.

42:28.180 --> 42:30.224
All right. Good.

42:32.518 --> 42:35.355
- Check the generator.
- Yes, master.

42:43.113 --> 42:44.364
I-gor,

42:44.489 --> 42:47.909
- release the safety valve on the main wheel.
- Yes, master.

42:53.999 --> 42:58.545
Can you imagine the brain
of Hans Delbruck in this body?

42:58.628 --> 43:00.589
Oh, Frederick.

43:01.131 --> 43:03.175
This is the moment.

43:04.176 --> 43:06.220
Well, dear...

43:06.346 --> 43:08.389
Are you ready?

43:08.514 --> 43:10.558
Yes, Doctor.

43:12.018 --> 43:14.062
Elevate me.

43:14.812 --> 43:16.856
Now? Right here?

43:18.691 --> 43:22.487
- Yes, yes. Raise the platform.
- Oh, the platform.

43:22.612 --> 43:24.864
<i>Oh, that. Ja... yes.</i>

43:44.051 --> 43:48.597
From that fateful day
when stinking bits of slime

43:48.681 --> 43:53.394
first crawled from the sea
and shouted to the cold stars:

43:54.019 --> 43:56.689
"I am man",

43:58.023 --> 44:02.736
our greatest dread has always been
the knowledge of our own mortality.

44:03.529 --> 44:05.573
But tonight

44:05.699 --> 44:08.451
we shall hurl the gauntlet of science

44:08.576 --> 44:12.163
into the frightful face of death itself.

44:14.541 --> 44:16.584
Tonight,

44:16.835 --> 44:20.755
we shall ascend into the heavens.

44:21.381 --> 44:24.300
We shall mock the earthquake.

44:25.010 --> 44:27.554
We shall command the thunders

44:28.388 --> 44:30.432
and penetrate

44:30.557 --> 44:37.189
into the very womb
of impervious nature herself.

44:45.489 --> 44:49.243
When I give the word,
throw the first switch.

44:49.785 --> 44:51.829
You've got it, master.

44:55.958 --> 44:58.002
Get ready.

45:00.921 --> 45:02.882
Get set.

45:02.965 --> 45:04.759
Go!

45:10.766 --> 45:13.018
Throw the second switch.

45:17.606 --> 45:20.192
Throw the third switch.

45:20.317 --> 45:22.736
Not the third switch?

45:22.861 --> 45:25.947
Throw it, I say. Throw it!

45:37.960 --> 45:40.004
Life.

45:40.129 --> 45:42.715
Life, do you hear me?

45:42.840 --> 45:44.884
Give my creation

45:45.635 --> 45:48.096
life!

46:10.244 --> 46:12.746
Turn everything off and bring me down.

47:22.818 --> 47:24.862
Nothing.

47:25.321 --> 47:27.823
- Oh, Doctor. I'm sorry...
- No, no.

47:28.657 --> 47:31.494
Be of good cheer.

47:31.577 --> 47:34.497
If science teaches us anything,

47:34.580 --> 47:38.126
it teaches us to accept our failures

47:38.251 --> 47:40.754
as well as our successes

47:41.463 --> 47:44.883
with quiet dignity

47:46.385 --> 47:48.679
and grace.

47:58.897 --> 48:01.441
Son of a bitch, bastard. I'll get you for this.

48:01.566 --> 48:03.610
What did you do to me?

48:03.735 --> 48:07.448
- What did you do to me?
- Doctor, stop it!

48:07.573 --> 48:09.450
You'll kill him!

48:10.868 --> 48:12.495
I don't wanna live.

48:12.620 --> 48:15.957
I do not want to live.

48:18.251 --> 48:20.920
Quiet dignity and grace.

48:21.921 --> 48:24.007
Mama!

48:25.466 --> 48:29.137
Oh, tosh! This man is different, I tell you.

48:29.262 --> 48:33.016
You can see that after you've
talked to him for five minutes.

48:35.059 --> 48:36.687
Yes?

48:38.230 --> 48:40.274
He's a Frankenstein!

48:40.399 --> 48:43.652
And they're all alike.

48:44.361 --> 48:46.864
It's in their blood. They can't 'elp it.

48:47.406 --> 48:50.075
All those scientists, they're all alike.

48:50.826 --> 48:52.870
They say they're working for us.

48:53.203 --> 48:57.249
What they really want is to rule the world.

49:03.797 --> 49:08.178
That's enough now. I will not have
this meeting become a free-for-all.

49:08.261 --> 49:11.097
These are very serious charges
you're making,

49:11.222 --> 49:16.269
and all the more painful to us, your elders,
because we still have nightmares

49:16.394 --> 49:19.064
from five times before.

49:19.856 --> 49:26.029
Now, we haven't heard from the one man
most qualified to judge the situation fairly.

49:27.655 --> 49:29.699
Inspector Kemp.

49:30.825 --> 49:33.203
Will you talk to us, please?

50:00.981 --> 50:04.568
A riot is an ugly thing

50:04.694 --> 50:09.074
<i>und once you get one started</i>

50:09.199 --> 50:12.285
there is little chance of stopping it

50:13.078 --> 50:15.539
short of bloodshed.

50:16.498 --> 50:21.712
I think before we go around killing people,

50:21.878 --> 50:27.467
we had better make damn sure
of our evidence.

50:28.969 --> 50:31.013
<i>Und...</i>

50:35.350 --> 50:38.771
...we had better confirm the fact

50:38.896 --> 50:42.942
that young Frankenstein is indeed

50:43.026 --> 50:46.195
vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.447
What?

50:47.572 --> 50:50.575
Vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps.
Vootstaps.

50:50.658 --> 50:52.118
Oh, footsteps.

50:52.243 --> 50:54.287
I think

50:54.412 --> 50:56.706
what is in order

50:58.624 --> 51:03.588
is for me to pay a little visit
on the good doctor

51:04.213 --> 51:09.970
<i>und to have a nice, quiet chat.</i>

51:14.975 --> 51:16.852
Reputation.

51:17.144 --> 51:19.188
Reputation.

51:20.189 --> 51:23.525
Oh, Doctor. You mustn't do this to yourself.

51:24.651 --> 51:27.029
You've got to stop thinking about it.

51:27.696 --> 51:30.699
Why, look.
You haven't even touched your food.

51:32.785 --> 51:34.161
There.

51:35.496 --> 51:37.916
Now I've touched it. Happy?

51:39.667 --> 51:42.754
You know... I'll never forget my old dad.

51:43.755 --> 51:48.635
When these things would happen to him...
the things he'd say to me.

51:50.178 --> 51:52.222
What did he say?

51:52.305 --> 51:55.392
What the hell are you doin'
in the bathroom day and night?

51:55.475 --> 51:59.062
Why don't you get outta there
and give someone else a chance?

52:05.443 --> 52:08.531
Oh, maybe it's better this way.

52:08.656 --> 52:11.158
The poor lifeless hulk.

52:11.283 --> 52:14.286
Maybe it is better off dead.

52:33.347 --> 52:35.141
What is this?

52:35.224 --> 52:37.269
<i>Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte.</i>

52:39.771 --> 52:44.568
Do you like it? I'm not partial to
desserts myself, but this is excellent.

52:44.693 --> 52:47.154
Who are you talking to?

52:47.571 --> 52:51.950
To you. You just made a yummy sound,
so I thought you liked the dessert.

52:52.075 --> 52:55.245
I didn't make a yummy sound.
I just asked you what it is.

52:55.328 --> 52:58.582
- But you did. I just heard it.
- It wasn't me.

52:58.665 --> 53:00.709
It wasn't me.

53:00.834 --> 53:04.546
Well, now, look here.
If it wasn't you and it wasn't you...

53:27.070 --> 53:30.406
Alive. It's alive.

53:31.199 --> 53:33.868
It's alive!

53:36.496 --> 53:38.791
Stand back.

53:46.215 --> 53:48.884
Hello, there.

53:48.967 --> 53:52.054
I'm going to set you free.

53:54.348 --> 53:57.017
- Is the sedative ready?
- Yes, Doctor.

54:11.449 --> 54:13.493
I want you

54:14.285 --> 54:17.205
to sit up.

54:31.511 --> 54:35.432
Stand on your feet.

54:39.812 --> 54:42.106
You can do it.

54:51.657 --> 54:54.660
Now walk.

55:01.792 --> 55:04.128
Doctor, I'm frightened.

55:04.253 --> 55:06.380
Don't worry.

55:09.051 --> 55:11.094
Good.

55:12.971 --> 55:15.015
Good.

55:16.641 --> 55:18.977
What is it? What's the matter?

55:19.102 --> 55:21.688
Quick. Give him the...

55:21.813 --> 55:23.190
Quick. Give him the...

55:23.315 --> 55:25.567
What? Give him the what?

55:26.318 --> 55:29.821
Three syllables.
First syllable - sounds like...

55:29.946 --> 55:32.282
Head. Sounds like head.

55:32.699 --> 55:34.743
Bed... Said...

55:35.202 --> 55:36.661
Said.

55:36.787 --> 55:38.247
- Said.
- Said.

55:38.373 --> 55:40.375
Second syllable - little word.

55:40.500 --> 55:42.126
This, that, the...

55:42.251 --> 55:43.961
A...

55:44.504 --> 55:46.547
- Said a...
- Said a...

55:47.131 --> 55:49.175
Dirty word. He said a dirty word.

55:49.967 --> 55:52.011
Sounds like...

55:52.136 --> 55:54.180
To give. Give.

55:54.430 --> 55:57.266
Said... Said a give... Give him a said a give.

55:58.059 --> 56:00.895
Oh, tive... tive... Sedative.

56:01.020 --> 56:03.064
On the nosey.

56:22.835 --> 56:24.878
Said a give?

56:32.970 --> 56:35.639
Oh, Frederick. Are you all right?

56:35.764 --> 56:37.933
Yes.

56:38.685 --> 56:42.647
- Would you excuse me for one minute, dear?
- Of course, Doctor.

56:43.231 --> 56:45.275
I-gor...

56:46.234 --> 56:49.070
- May I speak to you for a moment?
- Of course.

56:49.195 --> 56:51.322
- Sit down, won't you?
- Thank you.

56:54.701 --> 56:56.578
No, no. Up here.

56:57.162 --> 56:59.039
Thank you.

57:03.251 --> 57:06.337
Now, that brain that you gave me...

57:07.213 --> 57:09.967
Was it Hans Delbruck's?

57:11.969 --> 57:14.472
- No.
- Good.

57:16.599 --> 57:18.142
Would you mind telling me...

57:20.144 --> 57:24.273
...whose brain I did put in?

57:24.357 --> 57:29.153
- Then you won't be angry?
- I will not be angry.

57:29.945 --> 57:31.989
Abby someone.

57:32.656 --> 57:34.867
Abby someone...

57:34.992 --> 57:37.661
- Abby who?
- Abby Normal.

57:40.374 --> 57:42.626
Abby Normal...

57:43.085 --> 57:45.212
I'm almost sure that was the name.

57:49.299 --> 57:53.929
Are you saying that I put an abnormal brain

57:54.888 --> 57:58.308
into a seven-and-a-half-foot long,

57:59.434 --> 58:02.604
54-inch wide

58:04.481 --> 58:06.525
gorilla?

58:07.150 --> 58:09.904
Is that what you're telling me?

58:10.363 --> 58:12.323
Quick, quick. Give him the...

58:12.448 --> 58:14.325
What?

58:14.450 --> 58:16.494
Three syllables, yes.

58:17.870 --> 58:19.997
I wonder who that could be at this hour.

58:26.462 --> 58:29.799
Inga, quick. See who that is.

58:30.007 --> 58:34.804
You... put that thing
back on the operating table.

58:35.847 --> 58:39.184
And strap him down tightly.

58:40.561 --> 58:43.647
- Where are you going?
- To wash up. I've got to look normal.

58:43.772 --> 58:46.108
We've all of us got to behave normally.

58:49.278 --> 58:50.988
Monsters!

58:56.035 --> 58:57.995
Excellent shot.

58:58.120 --> 59:02.750
This is the 20th century, Kemp.
Monsters are passé like ghosts and goblins.

59:02.833 --> 59:07.129
<i>Not to the good people
of this village, Herr Doktor.</i>

59:08.757 --> 59:10.300
To them

59:10.383 --> 59:13.386
he is a very real thing.

59:14.304 --> 59:19.976
Especially when...
there is a Frankenstein residing in this house.

59:34.866 --> 59:36.951
Nice grouping.

59:37.077 --> 59:39.121
Thank you.

59:41.582 --> 59:47.505
I wouldn't think an intelligent fellow like you
would fall for all this superstitious rot.

59:48.464 --> 59:53.219
<i>It is not superstition that worries me,
Herr Doktor, but genes und</i>

59:53.677 --> 59:55.388
chromosomes.

59:56.305 --> 59:59.558
- Rubbish.
- Well, you might say, but this is

01:00:00.101 --> 01:00:01.644
Transylvania.

01:00:03.896 --> 01:00:05.856
<i>Und you are a</i>

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:07.316
Frankenstein.

01:00:10.237 --> 01:00:15.450
You... seem unusually upset
by this discussion.

01:00:15.575 --> 01:00:17.619
Not in the least.

01:00:18.453 --> 01:00:20.664
I find it extremely amusing, that's all.

01:00:23.542 --> 01:00:25.335
Well, this was fun.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.296
Now, if you don't mind, Inspector,
I'm a little tired.

01:00:28.422 --> 01:00:29.589
Then

01:00:29.715 --> 01:00:33.093
I may give the villagers
your complete assurance

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:39.434
that you have no interest whatsoever
in carrying on your grandfather's work?

01:00:42.562 --> 01:00:44.605
May I take that for a yes?

01:00:46.357 --> 01:00:48.067
Very well.

01:00:48.192 --> 01:00:51.362
- You can find the way out by yourself?
- Of course.

01:00:52.572 --> 01:00:57.118
<i>Until we meet again... Herr Baron.</i>

01:00:57.201 --> 01:00:59.787
Yes. Drop by any time. We are always open.

01:01:42.874 --> 01:01:44.918
Oh, Victor.

01:01:45.585 --> 01:01:47.295
Victor...

01:01:47.379 --> 01:01:49.798
We have done it.

01:01:53.218 --> 01:01:55.678
I'm going to set you free.

01:01:55.804 --> 01:01:58.973
<i>Would you like that, meine Seuchekopf?</i>

01:02:08.775 --> 01:02:10.820
They wanted to hurt you.

01:02:11.862 --> 01:02:13.906
But I'm going to help you.

01:02:15.533 --> 01:02:17.576
Thank heavens that's over with.

01:02:18.577 --> 01:02:20.621
<i>Frau Blücher.</i>

01:02:22.498 --> 01:02:25.042
Stop. Don't come closer.

01:02:25.167 --> 01:02:28.254
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to set him free.

01:02:28.379 --> 01:02:30.423
No. No, you mustn't.

01:02:30.548 --> 01:02:31.924
Yes.

01:02:32.925 --> 01:02:35.261
Are you insane? He'll kill you.

01:02:36.637 --> 01:02:39.056
No, he won't. Not this one.

01:02:39.181 --> 01:02:42.269
He is as gentle as a lamb.

01:02:42.394 --> 01:02:46.690
Stand back. Stand back.
For the love of God, he has a rotten brain.

01:02:47.274 --> 01:02:49.568
It's not rotten. It's a good brain.

01:02:49.693 --> 01:02:52.696
It's rotten, I tell you. Rotten.

01:02:53.613 --> 01:02:56.700
Lxnay on the ottenray.

01:02:56.825 --> 01:03:00.537
I'm not afraid. I know what he likes.

01:03:15.928 --> 01:03:17.972
That music.

01:03:18.097 --> 01:03:23.936
Yes. It's in your blood.
It's in the blood of all Frankensteins.

01:03:24.062 --> 01:03:28.107
It reaches the soul when words are useless.

01:03:28.232 --> 01:03:31.861
Your grandfather used to play it
to the creature he was making.

01:03:31.986 --> 01:03:34.572
- Then it was you all the time.
- Yes.

01:03:34.697 --> 01:03:37.700
- You played that music in the night.
- Yes.

01:03:37.825 --> 01:03:40.579
- To get us into the laboratory.
- Yes.

01:03:40.704 --> 01:03:44.291
- That was your cigar in the ashtray.
- Yes.

01:03:44.416 --> 01:03:47.795
And it was you who left
my grandfather's book out for me to find.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.171
Yes.

01:03:49.296 --> 01:03:51.006
- So that I would...
- Yes.

01:03:51.131 --> 01:03:53.801
- Then you and Victor were...
- Yes.

01:03:53.884 --> 01:03:56.136
Yes! Say it!

01:03:56.261 --> 01:04:00.099
He was my boyfriend.

01:04:11.986 --> 01:04:14.030
You will never catch him now.

01:04:14.155 --> 01:04:17.492
He's free. Do you hear?

01:04:17.617 --> 01:04:19.953
Free.

01:04:33.591 --> 01:04:35.051
Gone.

01:04:35.593 --> 01:04:36.970
Gone!

01:04:37.095 --> 01:04:39.597
We've got to find him, do you understand?

01:04:39.723 --> 01:04:42.643
We've got to find him
before he kills someone.

01:04:43.394 --> 01:04:45.438
What have I done?

01:04:45.896 --> 01:04:48.149
Oh, God in heaven.

01:04:49.233 --> 01:04:51.277
What have I done?

01:04:57.742 --> 01:05:01.120
Oh, I love my pretty little flower

01:05:01.579 --> 01:05:05.082
Oh, I love my pretty little flower

01:05:05.207 --> 01:05:08.127
Oh, I love my flower

01:05:14.468 --> 01:05:16.511
That monster is loose...

01:05:17.596 --> 01:05:20.432
Boards must be tight.

01:05:22.434 --> 01:05:24.478
There.

01:05:26.146 --> 01:05:28.190
Thank God you put Helga to bed.

01:05:28.315 --> 01:05:32.611
With all this monster business,
I take no chances. I remember the last time.

01:05:32.694 --> 01:05:37.783
<i>But, Papa. I told you that I was turning
the Rostbraten, don't you remember?</i>

01:05:37.908 --> 01:05:39.951
I asked you to put Helga to...

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:41.996
You...

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:49.087
Now throw a kiss and say bye-bye.

01:05:57.261 --> 01:05:59.639
Oh, dear. Nothing left.

01:05:59.764 --> 01:06:02.350
What shall we throw in now?

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:09.399
Maybe she was in the bathroom
when you looked.

01:06:09.524 --> 01:06:12.778
But I didn't even look upstairs.
I thought you did.

01:06:15.072 --> 01:06:17.116
You didn't look upstairs?

01:06:18.867 --> 01:06:20.911
Sit down.

01:06:22.079 --> 01:06:23.455
Sit down!

01:07:11.297 --> 01:07:14.050
A visitor is all I ask.

01:07:14.133 --> 01:07:18.763
A temporary companion to help me
pass a few short hours in my lonely life.

01:07:22.808 --> 01:07:26.062
Thank you, Lord. Thank you.

01:07:35.821 --> 01:07:38.908
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't speak. Don't say a word.

01:07:39.492 --> 01:07:42.662
Oh, my joy and my prize from heaven.

01:07:43.538 --> 01:07:46.708
Oh, you must have been
the tallest one in your class.

01:07:46.833 --> 01:07:50.462
My name is Harold and I live here all alone.

01:07:50.587 --> 01:07:52.381
What is your name?

01:07:52.506 --> 01:07:54.716
I didn't get that.

01:07:55.675 --> 01:07:57.386
No...

01:07:58.053 --> 01:07:59.846
Forgive me.

01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:02.933
I didn't realise you were a mute.

01:08:03.016 --> 01:08:05.060
You see how heaven plans.

01:08:05.185 --> 01:08:08.563
Me, a poor blind man, and you a mute.

01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:13.111
An incredibly big mute.

01:08:13.236 --> 01:08:15.530
But your hand is frozen, my child.

01:08:15.655 --> 01:08:18.323
How does a nice bowl of soup sound, huh?

01:08:28.667 --> 01:08:32.505
Well, I know what it means
to be cold and hungry.

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:33.673
Yes...

01:08:33.798 --> 01:08:37.468
And how much it means to have
a little kindness from a stranger.

01:08:37.593 --> 01:08:40.345
Are you ready for your soup?

01:08:42.057 --> 01:08:44.893
Hold out your bowl, then.

01:08:46.562 --> 01:08:48.522
Oh, my friend...

01:08:48.647 --> 01:08:51.191
You don't know what your visit means to me.

01:08:51.316 --> 01:08:54.944
How long I've waited for the pleasure
of another human being.

01:08:55.069 --> 01:08:58.823
Sometimes in our preoccupation
with worldly matters,

01:09:00.658 --> 01:09:04.537
we tend to forget the simple pleasures

01:09:04.662 --> 01:09:07.916
that are the basis for true happiness.

01:09:09.417 --> 01:09:12.421
And now a little wine with your soup?

01:09:14.256 --> 01:09:16.301
Good, good.

01:09:25.393 --> 01:09:28.063
Huh? Good. Yes.

01:09:32.442 --> 01:09:34.778
Wait!

01:09:34.903 --> 01:09:37.279
A toast.

01:09:37.404 --> 01:09:41.076
A toast to long friendship.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.542
How hungry you must have been.

01:09:49.667 --> 01:09:52.129
Now for a little surprise.

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:55.007
For a special occasion, I've been saving...

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:02.264
...cigars.

01:10:03.891 --> 01:10:05.684
Take one.

01:10:09.355 --> 01:10:10.189
What?

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:12.317
No, no, no.

01:10:12.984 --> 01:10:14.945
Fire is good.

01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:18.573
Fire is good. Yes, fire is our friend.

01:10:18.698 --> 01:10:20.992
Yes. I'll show you.

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:31.670
You see?

01:10:32.337 --> 01:10:34.131
You have your cigar?

01:10:34.214 --> 01:10:36.258
Let me see. Let me see.

01:10:36.383 --> 01:10:38.009
All right.

01:10:38.093 --> 01:10:40.137
Now, now, now...

01:10:40.804 --> 01:10:43.141
Just hold it right there. Now,

01:10:43.891 --> 01:10:47.061
don't inhale until the tip glows.

01:11:05.455 --> 01:11:07.498
Wait.

01:11:09.542 --> 01:11:11.085
Wait.

01:11:11.169 --> 01:11:13.213
Where are you going?

01:11:13.797 --> 01:11:17.259
I was gonna make espresso.

01:12:00.804 --> 01:12:01.888
Now!

01:12:06.601 --> 01:12:08.645
Quick. Give him the sedative.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.124
He's out.

01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:30.876
I know.

01:12:39.719 --> 01:12:44.099
I'm going in there. Bring me that candle.

01:12:44.224 --> 01:12:46.268
- No.
- Yes.

01:12:50.939 --> 01:12:52.899
Love

01:12:53.024 --> 01:12:56.445
is the only thing
that can save this poor creature.

01:12:57.154 --> 01:13:00.240
And I am going to convince him
that he is loved

01:13:01.450 --> 01:13:04.453
even at the cost of my own life.

01:13:06.496 --> 01:13:10.876
No matter what you hear in there,
no matter how cruelly I beg you,

01:13:11.501 --> 01:13:14.422
no matter how terribly I may scream,

01:13:15.381 --> 01:13:19.761
do not open this door,
or you will undo everything I've worked for.

01:13:19.886 --> 01:13:21.429
Do you understand?

01:13:21.554 --> 01:13:24.724
Do not open this door.

01:13:24.807 --> 01:13:26.267
Yes, Doctor.

01:13:28.561 --> 01:13:30.605
Nice working with you.

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:05.974
Let me out. Let me out of here.
Get me the hell out of here.

01:14:06.725 --> 01:14:09.478
What's the matter with you people?
I was joking.

01:14:09.603 --> 01:14:11.814
Don't you know ajoke when you hear one?

01:14:15.485 --> 01:14:18.822
Jesus Christ. Get me outta here!

01:14:21.282 --> 01:14:24.953
Open this goddamn door
or I'll kick your rotten heads in.

01:14:25.078 --> 01:14:26.621
Mommy!

01:14:34.963 --> 01:14:36.840
Obviously...

01:14:40.927 --> 01:14:43.305
Hello, handsome.

01:14:46.308 --> 01:14:48.686
You're a good-looking fellow, you know?

01:14:48.811 --> 01:14:51.313
People laugh at you.

01:14:51.439 --> 01:14:54.191
People hate you, but why do they hate you?

01:14:54.316 --> 01:14:58.154
Because they are jealous.

01:14:59.405 --> 01:15:02.074
Look at that boyish face.

01:15:04.034 --> 01:15:06.078
Look at that sweet smile.

01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:10.916
Do you wanna talk about physical strength?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.337
Do you want to talk about sheer muscle?

01:15:15.797 --> 01:15:18.967
Do you want to talk
about the Olympian ideal?

01:15:19.092 --> 01:15:21.762
You are a god!

01:15:22.721 --> 01:15:24.765
And listen to me...

01:15:25.682 --> 01:15:28.226
You are not evil.

01:15:29.686 --> 01:15:33.982
You are good!

01:15:42.115 --> 01:15:45.119
This is a nice boy.

01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:47.914
This is a good boy.

01:15:48.873 --> 01:15:51.250
This is a mother's angel.

01:15:52.085 --> 01:15:54.754
And I want the world to know,

01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:59.217
once and for all and without any shame,

01:16:00.927 --> 01:16:03.679
that we love him.

01:16:07.642 --> 01:16:10.228
I'm going to teach you.

01:16:10.353 --> 01:16:15.234
I'm gonna show you how to walk,
how to speak, how to move, how to think.

01:16:16.318 --> 01:16:17.945
Together,

01:16:18.028 --> 01:16:20.072
you and I

01:16:20.155 --> 01:16:26.161
are going to make
the greatest single contribution to science

01:16:27.037 --> 01:16:29.790
since the creation of fire!

01:16:30.374 --> 01:16:33.836
Dr Fronkonsteen. Are you all right?

01:16:33.961 --> 01:16:36.004
My name...

01:16:36.839 --> 01:16:40.092
...is Frankenstein!

01:17:33.731 --> 01:17:37.234
Distinguished colleagues,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:17:37.318 --> 01:17:39.445
Tonight it is my great privilege

01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:43.867
of introducing to you a man
whose family name was once both

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:45.994
famous

01:17:46.119 --> 01:17:48.371
and infamous.

01:17:48.955 --> 01:17:55.420
<i>And now may I present to you
Doktor Baron Friedrich von Frankenstein.</i>

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:06.306
My fellow scienti...

01:18:07.557 --> 01:18:12.479
...tists... and neurosurgeons,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:16.109
A few short weeks ago,
coming from a background,

01:18:16.234 --> 01:18:21.406
believe me, as conservative and traditionally
grounded in scientific fact as any of you,

01:18:21.531 --> 01:18:26.494
I began an experiment in,
incredulous as it may sound,

01:18:27.662 --> 01:18:30.206
the reanimation of dead tissue.

01:18:33.418 --> 01:18:37.880
What I have to offer you might possibly be

01:18:38.005 --> 01:18:40.842
the gateway to immortality.

01:18:46.098 --> 01:18:52.020
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present for
your intellectual and philosophical pleasure

01:18:53.856 --> 01:18:55.899
the Creature.

01:19:02.322 --> 01:19:04.450
Remain in your seats, I beg you.

01:19:04.575 --> 01:19:07.911
We are not children here. We are scientists.

01:19:08.871 --> 01:19:11.248
I assure you there is nothing to fear.

01:19:14.878 --> 01:19:18.631
First may I offer for your consideration

01:19:18.757 --> 01:19:23.386
a neurological demonstration
of the primary cerebellar functions.

01:19:24.345 --> 01:19:27.432
Balance and coordination.

01:19:29.809 --> 01:19:32.812
Walk heel to toe.

01:19:46.410 --> 01:19:48.454
Backwards.

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:09.266
Ladies and gentlemen, you've seen
the Creature perform simple motor activity,

01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:14.231
but for what you will see next
we must enter quietly

01:20:14.356 --> 01:20:17.526
into the realm of genius.

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.364
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:20:26.201 --> 01:20:30.747
from what was once
an inarticulate mass of lifeless tissues,

01:20:30.831 --> 01:20:34.876
may I now present
a cultured, sophisticated

01:20:36.294 --> 01:20:38.088
man about town.

01:20:42.217 --> 01:20:43.468
Hit it.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.204
Nothing. Nothing, I tell you.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.790
Five, six, seven, eight...

01:22:36.127 --> 01:22:39.296
Come on. Are you trying
to make me look like a fool?

01:22:44.343 --> 01:22:45.721
Please. I beg you.

01:22:45.846 --> 01:22:48.598
For safety's sake, don't humiliate him.

01:22:51.852 --> 01:22:55.897
Come back. Do you hear me?
I will not let you destroy my work.

01:22:55.981 --> 01:22:58.650
As your creator
I command you to come back.

01:23:52.289 --> 01:23:54.083
Chained.

01:23:54.166 --> 01:23:56.835
Chained like a beast in a cage.

01:23:57.795 --> 01:24:00.255
Oh, Doctor. I feel so terrible.

01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:02.424
There's only one answer.

01:24:02.549 --> 01:24:07.262
If I could find a way to equalise
the imbalance in his cerebral-spinal fluid,

01:24:07.387 --> 01:24:10.224
why, he'd be as right as rain.

01:24:10.974 --> 01:24:12.601
But how?

01:24:12.726 --> 01:24:14.978
How, before it's too late?

01:24:16.231 --> 01:24:17.941
Oh, Frederick...

01:24:18.066 --> 01:24:20.193
If only there was some way I could...

01:24:21.319 --> 01:24:23.988
...relieve this torture you are going through.

01:24:26.199 --> 01:24:28.243
If there was some way I could help to...

01:24:30.078 --> 01:24:35.667
...relieve the tension. If there was just
some way I could give you a little peace.

01:24:43.591 --> 01:24:45.636
Doctor, I have...

01:24:45.761 --> 01:24:47.638
Doctor?

01:24:48.681 --> 01:24:50.725
What is it?

01:24:53.227 --> 01:24:55.104
Doctor...

01:24:55.187 --> 01:24:57.398
Where are you?

01:25:10.619 --> 01:25:14.206
I'm sorry, Doctor.
This cable came while you were gone.

01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:19.171
I thought I told you never to
interrupt me while I'm working.

01:25:20.505 --> 01:25:24.176
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I thought this was an emergency.

01:25:24.301 --> 01:25:28.221
You see, your fiancée
will be arriving any second.

01:25:28.346 --> 01:25:30.932
What? Elizabeth here tonight?

01:25:31.058 --> 01:25:34.394
Yes. I will go prepare a room at once.

01:25:36.021 --> 01:25:38.356
I suggest you put on a tie.

01:25:58.419 --> 01:26:00.546
Darling.

01:26:00.671 --> 01:26:02.757
Darling.

01:26:02.882 --> 01:26:04.425
- Surprised?
- Surprised.

01:26:04.509 --> 01:26:06.552
- Love me?
- Love you?

01:26:07.553 --> 01:26:09.597
Well...

01:26:10.389 --> 01:26:13.059
- Let's turn in.
- Darling.

01:26:13.142 --> 01:26:17.773
It's been a long day. I'm sure you're very tired.
I'll just pay the driver.

01:26:18.649 --> 01:26:21.318
- Darling.
- What?

01:26:21.902 --> 01:26:24.405
- Surprised?
- Yes.

01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:26.573
- Love me?
- Well...

01:26:26.698 --> 01:26:28.951
Well, let's turn in.

01:26:29.076 --> 01:26:30.619
- Darling.
- Yes.

01:26:30.744 --> 01:26:32.454
Say nothing, act casual.

01:26:32.538 --> 01:26:35.207
- Ready?
- Yes. I think...

01:26:35.916 --> 01:26:37.626
Yes.

01:26:37.751 --> 01:26:39.795
I am a bit tired after all.

01:26:42.005 --> 01:26:45.175
I'd like you to meet
my assistants, Inga and I-gor.

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.345
How do you do?

01:26:48.263 --> 01:26:49.264
How do you do?

01:26:49.389 --> 01:26:53.685
- This is my financier Elizabeth.
- I'm so happy to meet you at last.

01:26:53.768 --> 01:26:54.769
Financée.

01:26:54.894 --> 01:27:00.233
Excuse me, darling.
What is it exactly that you... do do?

01:27:02.986 --> 01:27:07.031
Well, I assist Dr Fronkonsteen
in the laboratory.

01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:09.868
<i>We have intellectual discussions und we...</i>

01:27:09.993 --> 01:27:12.328
As a matter of fact, we were just having one...

01:27:12.454 --> 01:27:13.830
- May I?
- What?

01:27:13.955 --> 01:27:15.582
Wait a minute...

01:27:15.707 --> 01:27:18.461
l-gor, would you give me
a hand with the bags?

01:27:18.544 --> 01:27:23.007
Certainly, you take the blonde
and I'll take the one in the turban.

01:27:27.845 --> 01:27:30.514
Stop that. I'm talking about the luggage.

01:27:30.639 --> 01:27:32.266
Yes, master.

01:27:32.933 --> 01:27:34.977
Ladies, this way.

01:27:36.729 --> 01:27:40.441
It'll be a long night.
If you need any help with the girls...

01:27:47.908 --> 01:27:50.160
You settle down now.

01:27:50.285 --> 01:27:53.455
Cos we gonna be pals.

01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:55.999
Right?

01:27:58.585 --> 01:28:00.629
Nice and cosy.

01:28:00.754 --> 01:28:03.840
Just like old friends.

01:28:12.933 --> 01:28:16.979
What's the matter?
You're afraid of this little fire?

01:28:17.063 --> 01:28:18.940
This can't hurt you.

01:28:19.023 --> 01:28:21.067
See?

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:24.237
Some monster you are.

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.447
See, Mama was right.

01:28:26.572 --> 01:28:30.034
Little boys ain't supposed to play with fire.

01:28:31.285 --> 01:28:33.955
Is they? Cos they might get hurt.

01:29:02.109 --> 01:29:03.652
Halt!

01:29:03.777 --> 01:29:05.487
Up.

01:29:05.571 --> 01:29:08.240
A riot is an ugly thing.

01:29:09.283 --> 01:29:13.495
<i>Und I think that it is just about time
that we had one.</i>

01:29:15.914 --> 01:29:17.459
Kill the monster.

01:29:17.834 --> 01:29:21.004
As heaven is my witness... Up.

01:29:21.087 --> 01:29:24.716
...he will curse the day

01:29:24.841 --> 01:29:28.636
that he was burn a Frankenstein.

01:29:29.637 --> 01:29:30.638
What?

01:29:31.639 --> 01:29:36.352
I said: "He will curse the day
that he was born a Frankenstein."

01:29:52.787 --> 01:29:56.415
Loose. He's broken loose.

01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:58.834
Do you know what that means?

01:29:58.959 --> 01:30:01.629
Darling, you mustn't worry so.

01:30:04.090 --> 01:30:06.050
I suppose you're right.

01:30:06.175 --> 01:30:08.052
Of course I am.

01:30:08.177 --> 01:30:10.221
Now come along like a good boy.

01:30:10.763 --> 01:30:12.723
What would I do without you?

01:30:12.807 --> 01:30:17.437
Is your room just down the hall
in case I get the frights during the night?

01:30:18.021 --> 01:30:22.901
Well, yes, but I thought perhaps tonight,
under the circumstances, I might

01:30:23.610 --> 01:30:25.612
stay here with you.

01:30:25.737 --> 01:30:28.323
Would you want me like this now?

01:30:28.448 --> 01:30:32.160
So soon before our wedding,
so near we can almost touch it?

01:30:34.955 --> 01:30:37.207
- Yes!
- Whoa, boy.

01:30:38.208 --> 01:30:40.252
Or

01:30:40.377 --> 01:30:46.133
to waitjust a little while longer when
I can give myself to you without hesitation,

01:30:46.258 --> 01:30:50.138
when I can be totally
and unashamedly and legally yours?

01:30:54.308 --> 01:30:56.894
That's a tough choice.

01:30:57.019 --> 01:30:59.272
You're a tough guy.

01:31:01.983 --> 01:31:03.860
I suppose you're right.

01:31:03.943 --> 01:31:05.987
Of course I am. I always am.

01:31:07.155 --> 01:31:09.699
Now give me a kiss and say good night.

01:31:12.994 --> 01:31:15.037
No tongues.

01:31:22.129 --> 01:31:24.631
Good night, darling.

01:31:24.798 --> 01:31:27.134
Good night, sweetheart.

01:31:27.259 --> 01:31:29.470
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:31:29.595 --> 01:31:33.515
You love me? I love you, honey.

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:36.018
- Sweet dreams, darling.
- Sweet dreams.

01:31:36.143 --> 01:31:39.480
Good night, don't let the bedbugs bite.

01:31:45.611 --> 01:31:51.701
He has loosed the fateful lightning
of his terrible swift sword

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:55.330
His truth is marching on

01:31:57.499 --> 01:32:01.795
Glory, glory, hallelujah...

01:32:56.893 --> 01:32:58.937
Where am I?

01:33:01.273 --> 01:33:03.859
Who are you? What are you?

01:33:03.984 --> 01:33:06.737
What do you want?
What are you going to do to me?

01:33:07.738 --> 01:33:09.698
Calm down.

01:33:09.781 --> 01:33:11.658
I'm not afraid of you.

01:33:11.742 --> 01:33:15.787
My father is very rich.
You'd have the world at your fingertips.

01:33:15.912 --> 01:33:22.253
Listen. I have to be back by 11.30.
I'm expecting a very important call.

01:33:23.212 --> 01:33:25.465
Speak! Why don't you speak?

01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:27.633
What are you doing?

01:33:27.759 --> 01:33:30.011
Oh, no, you can't be serious.

01:33:32.346 --> 01:33:34.390
I'm af...

01:33:35.183 --> 01:33:37.143
Oh, my God.

01:33:37.268 --> 01:33:38.269
Woof.

01:33:41.731 --> 01:33:43.357
I'm engaged.

01:33:43.483 --> 01:33:46.152
And once he... But I didn't... It was never...

01:33:52.826 --> 01:33:55.079
Sweet mystery of life

01:33:55.204 --> 01:33:58.207
At last I found you

01:33:58.791 --> 01:34:04.379
At last I know the secret of it all

01:34:36.204 --> 01:34:38.748
Penny for your thoughts.

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:43.795
You're incorrigible, aren't you?

01:34:44.170 --> 01:34:46.714
You little zipper-neck.

01:34:50.010 --> 01:34:51.470
All right.

01:34:51.554 --> 01:34:54.223
Seven has always been my lucky number.

01:34:55.641 --> 01:34:58.394
Come over here, you hot monster.

01:35:01.856 --> 01:35:04.692
What is it? What's the matter?

01:35:05.818 --> 01:35:07.987
Is it that music?

01:35:08.112 --> 01:35:11.907
It's probably from some nearby cottage.
Nothing to worry about.

01:35:12.032 --> 01:35:14.076
Where are you going? Where...

01:35:14.452 --> 01:35:16.412
You men are all alike.

01:35:16.537 --> 01:35:19.541
Seven or eight quick ones
and you're off with the boys.

01:35:19.624 --> 01:35:23.253
To boast and brag.
You better keep your mouth shut.

01:35:23.795 --> 01:35:26.548
Oh, I think I love him.

01:36:13.346 --> 01:36:16.808
Look, he's coming back.
Look, the music...

01:36:17.475 --> 01:36:19.478
Keep playing. It's the music.

01:36:19.603 --> 01:36:22.606
It's the music that's bringing him back.

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:27.111
Come on.

01:36:35.119 --> 01:36:36.912
Come on. Come.

01:36:42.042 --> 01:36:44.253
Come on. You can do it.

01:36:50.093 --> 01:36:52.762
Come on. You can do it.

01:36:59.018 --> 01:37:02.939
Don't touch him!
He wants to do it by himself.

01:37:03.606 --> 01:37:06.609
You can do it. You can do it.

01:37:07.402 --> 01:37:09.904
Please, my creation.

01:37:20.249 --> 01:37:22.293
Quick. Catch him.

01:37:27.298 --> 01:37:30.801
Have all the preparations
been made for the transference?

01:37:30.926 --> 01:37:32.386
Yes, Doctor.

01:37:32.511 --> 01:37:35.014
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

01:37:35.139 --> 01:37:37.600
It's the only thing that can save him now.

01:37:38.225 --> 01:37:41.312
You realise you're risking both your lives?

01:37:43.773 --> 01:37:45.816
Yes.

01:37:58.538 --> 01:38:00.582
Switching off.

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:22.772
How will I know when they are done?

01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:25.191
The doctor said to allow 15 minutes.

01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:28.111
Not one second more

01:38:28.194 --> 01:38:29.987
or less.

01:38:38.621 --> 01:38:40.331
How long now?

01:38:40.415 --> 01:38:42.041
Two minutes.

01:39:04.481 --> 01:39:06.525
- What's that noise?
- I don't know.

01:39:06.650 --> 01:39:08.944
- What time is it?
- Almost time.

01:39:13.574 --> 01:39:16.493
Oh, my God. It's the villagers.

01:39:18.704 --> 01:39:20.957
No! No! Please.

01:39:21.082 --> 01:39:23.334
Just another seven seconds.

01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:28.673
No! No!

01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:32.343
No! No! No!

01:39:33.052 --> 01:39:35.805
- Put that man down.
- It's the monster.

01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:37.724
- No, it can't be.
- It is.

01:39:37.807 --> 01:39:40.477
I said: "Put that man down."

01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:52.490
<i>Und just who do you think you are</i>

01:39:52.573 --> 01:39:55.493
that you order these people about?

01:39:55.618 --> 01:39:57.661
I am the monster.

01:39:59.747 --> 01:40:02.500
<i>Ja. I see that you are the monster.</i>

01:40:02.625 --> 01:40:05.294
For as long as I can remember

01:40:05.377 --> 01:40:07.880
people have hated me.

01:40:08.172 --> 01:40:11.342
They looked at my face and my body

01:40:11.467 --> 01:40:13.511
and they ran away in horror.

01:40:13.636 --> 01:40:20.352
In my loneliness, I decided that if I could not
inspire love, which was my deepest hope,

01:40:20.477 --> 01:40:22.646
I would instead cause fear.

01:40:24.815 --> 01:40:26.858
I live,

01:40:28.151 --> 01:40:33.406
because this poor, half-crazed
genius has given me life.

01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:36.034
He alone held an image of me

01:40:36.159 --> 01:40:38.537
as something beautiful.

01:40:38.954 --> 01:40:40.831
And then,

01:40:40.956 --> 01:40:44.793
when it would have been easy enough
to stay out of danger,

01:40:45.293 --> 01:40:48.380
he used his own body as a guinea pig

01:40:48.463 --> 01:40:51.134
to give me a calmer brain

01:40:52.218 --> 01:40:58.474
and a somewhat more
sophisticated way of expressing myself.

01:40:58.599 --> 01:41:03.396
Well, this is, of course,
an entirely different situation.

01:41:04.105 --> 01:41:06.774
As the leader of this community,

01:41:06.899 --> 01:41:10.611
may I be the first to offer you my hand

01:41:11.362 --> 01:41:13.406
in friendship.

01:41:19.454 --> 01:41:21.832
- Thank you.
- You are entirely welcome.

01:41:21.957 --> 01:41:26.879
<i>Und now let us all go to my house
for a little sponge cake und a little wine...</i>

01:41:28.213 --> 01:41:30.257
<i>... und shit!</i>

01:41:32.801 --> 01:41:34.845
To the lumberyard!

01:41:58.661 --> 01:42:01.247
Hello, Mrs Frankenstein.

01:42:01.998 --> 01:42:05.251
Mrs Frankenstein. What a beautiful name.

01:42:05.376 --> 01:42:07.087
Oh, darling.

01:42:07.170 --> 01:42:09.214
Hold on to your hat.

01:42:10.673 --> 01:42:11.591
What?

01:42:11.716 --> 01:42:14.719
I'll be right back.

01:42:28.984 --> 01:42:31.570
I'm holding on to it, darling.

01:42:32.613 --> 01:42:35.074
Just a few more seconds.

01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:19.369
Honey, I hope you didn't find
Daddy's little party too boring.

01:43:19.494 --> 01:43:22.915
He did itjust for you
and he meant so well. Say you liked it.

01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:26.294
Honey, did you see?

01:43:26.419 --> 01:43:29.922
I put a special hamper in the bathroom
just for your shirts

01:43:30.006 --> 01:43:33.092
and the other one is just for socks
and poo-poo undies.

01:43:33.217 --> 01:43:34.927
Here I come.

01:44:04.041 --> 01:44:06.543
The feeling is mutual.

01:44:08.837 --> 01:44:10.881
You know, it's a puzzlement.

01:44:11.006 --> 01:44:15.469
There's something I've always wanted
to ask you about that operation.

01:44:15.594 --> 01:44:17.805
You know in the transference part,

01:44:17.888 --> 01:44:23.394
the monster got part of your wonderful brain,
but what did you ever get from him?

01:44:33.113 --> 01:44:36.116
No. I don't believe...

01:44:40.328 --> 01:44:42.539
Sweet mystery of life

01:44:42.664 --> 01:44:45.416
At last I found you

01:45:33.133 --> 01:45:35.177
