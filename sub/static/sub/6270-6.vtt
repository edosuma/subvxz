hospital and cross-reference our findings.

11:48.774 --> 11:50.826
We can't. Get this.

11:50.855 --> 11:53.763
The admitting doctor
and two researchers all died

11:53.777 --> 11:56.662
of severe lung infections
three weeks after the incident.

11:56.696 --> 11:59.331
The hospital
was demolished due

11:59.365 --> 12:01.149
to an apparent asbestos
contamination.

12:01.167 --> 12:02.984
The sample was never recovered.

12:03.002 --> 12:04.986
- Well, that's not very helpful.
- No.

12:05.004 --> 12:07.578
(knocking) FREYA: Hello.

12:07.579 --> 12:08.862
Can I come in?

12:08.863 --> 12:10.959
- Hey, babe.
- Freya, so good to see you.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.995
Hi. (groans)
What is that thing?

12:14.013 --> 12:16.098
That is a medical mystery.

12:16.132 --> 12:18.025
But I'm gonna solve it.

12:18.699 --> 12:19.987
Where'd it come from?

12:19.988 --> 12:21.937
Oh, I pulled it out
of Maura Thatcher's throat

12:21.971 --> 12:23.799
the day she freaked out
on your family at the Bent Elbow.

12:23.800 --> 12:24.846
You did?

12:24.847 --> 12:27.149
Hey, maybe she was cursed
by a voodoo priestess.

12:27.150 --> 12:28.536
What?!
(chuckles)

12:28.538 --> 12:30.784
She's kidding. Look,
why don't we take a break?

12:30.785 --> 12:32.053
Maybe we should
grab some lunch?

12:32.054 --> 12:34.296
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

12:42.856 --> 12:44.377
Oh, no.

12:46.012 --> 12:49.014
(exhales)

12:49.048 --> 12:51.350
Archibald.

12:55.709 --> 12:58.173
I got another letter from Freya!

12:58.191 --> 13:02.176
She's settled in San Francisco and
says she's met the love of her life.

13:02.177 --> 13:06.512
- (chuckles) What else is new?
- Oh, I miss her so.

13:06.576 --> 13:10.062
Edith, tell me
what the problem is.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.732
My hands are so sore
I can barely lift 'em.

13:13.750 --> 13:16.902
And I'm afraid
they'll never work again.

13:16.920 --> 13:19.171
Well, not to worry.

13:19.206 --> 13:22.241
Wendy will mix you just
the right salve.

13:22.259 --> 13:25.599
And in the meantime,
close your eyes, Edith.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.911
(quietly): <i>Sana manus
mulieris huius.</i>

13:27.912 --> 13:30.536
<i>Sana manus mulieris huius.</i>

13:31.509 --> 13:33.520
Oh, my.

13:33.735 --> 13:35.719
It's much better.
(gasps)

13:35.737 --> 13:37.320
Like... magic.

13:37.321 --> 13:40.648
It's just a little healing technique
I picked up in Europe. Oh...

13:40.649 --> 13:42.082
Oh...

13:42.152 --> 13:46.215
Edith, this is the ointment that
you rub on your hands twice daily.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.247
Oh, thank you.

13:47.282 --> 13:50.250
You three really are
miracle-workers.

13:50.285 --> 13:51.485
(chuckles)

13:51.500 --> 13:52.851
Thank you, Edith.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.364
(whistles softly)

14:12.885 --> 14:14.718
Joanna...

14:15.237 --> 14:17.027
You're looking well.

14:17.062 --> 14:18.529
That'll be two dollars.

14:18.563 --> 14:20.647
Mm.

14:23.318 --> 14:25.285
Oh, uh, one more thing.

14:25.320 --> 14:28.124
One of my disciples
has fallen ill.

14:28.131 --> 14:31.174
I'm looking for an herb.
It's called <i>feverfox</i>.

14:31.175 --> 14:32.871
I've never heard of it.

14:32.902 --> 14:35.712
Hmm. I believe I've seen it here
on your shelves.

14:35.747 --> 14:38.393
It's a...
it's a bluish powder.

14:39.667 --> 14:42.920
No. My sister's right.
We don't stock <i>feverfox</i>.

14:42.954 --> 14:45.639
It's illegal and rather toxic
in the wrong hands.

14:45.673 --> 14:48.721
Hmm. I thought
you'd never heard of it.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.706
She hasn't. I have.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.308
We can't help you.

14:52.343 --> 14:53.709
Of course.

14:54.189 --> 14:56.579
Well, I'll be going, then.

15:00.351 --> 15:03.719
You ladies really must pay
a visit to Fair Haven.

15:04.167 --> 15:07.990
It's finally complete, and I think you'll
be impressed with what we're doing.

15:08.025 --> 15:11.077
It is the next level of being
for our kind.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.829
- No, thank you.
- We're good.

15:12.863 --> 15:14.474
ARCHIBALD:
As you wish.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.315
Ingrid?

15:17.117 --> 15:18.317
Good to see you.

15:22.790 --> 15:26.242
(moaning)

15:32.599 --> 15:34.517
FREYA:
Hey, what's up?

15:34.551 --> 15:36.085
Should we be worried about this?

15:36.103 --> 15:37.420
(gasps)

15:38.472 --> 15:41.757
- Where did you get that?
- At the hospital. Why? What is it?

15:41.775 --> 15:44.560
<i>Ramus mortium,</i> branch of death.
You touch it, you die.

15:45.824 --> 15:48.025
(gasps) What? (moaning)

15:51.185 --> 15:53.124
What if it's too late?

15:53.176 --> 15:55.745
Ramus mortium sickness
takes a few weeks to kick in.

15:55.746 --> 15:59.226
- (sniffs) So we have time. We'll fix it.
- And when it does kick in?

15:59.230 --> 16:01.264
You know that, uh,
drippy metallic-y stuff

16:01.282 --> 16:03.033
- ...that was on the branch?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

16:03.067 --> 16:07.270
That slowly but surely fills up your
lungs until you drown from within.

16:07.288 --> 16:09.272
- Why would you tell me that?
- You asked.

16:09.290 --> 16:11.208
You didn't have to answer
that honestly. (groans)

16:11.242 --> 16:14.578
Oh, my God. This is all your fault. You
were the one that put the spell on Maura.

16:14.612 --> 16:16.796
No, no, no. This is something
much bigger, much darker.

16:16.831 --> 16:18.798
I bet it happened when
the shifter attacked her.

16:18.833 --> 16:21.451
So why isn't Maura dead
if this thing is so toxic?

16:21.469 --> 16:23.887
She's the host. It grew from
within, so she's immune.

16:23.921 --> 16:27.446
- You on the other hand...
- Oh, yeah, I know. I'm infected.

16:27.526 --> 16:30.473
Okay, Freya, I'm gonna need you
to listen to me.

16:30.519 --> 16:32.103
I'm not gonna lie to you.

16:32.108 --> 16:35.152
<i>Ramus mortium</i> sickness is bad.
Really bad.

16:35.153 --> 16:37.595
I've seen people die from it.
I've seen you die from it

16:37.596 --> 16:40.166
300 years ago, so I'm gonna
need you to suck it up.

16:40.177 --> 16:42.533
Wow. This is the world's
shittiest pep talk.

16:42.534 --> 16:44.618
My point is you don't have
to die from it.

16:44.652 --> 16:47.354
We didn't know how to stop it
back then. We do now.

16:47.372 --> 16:49.913
This drink is the cure.
I'm gonna need you to make it.

16:49.914 --> 16:51.176
But why me?

16:51.207 --> 16:54.795
Honey, even with all your inexperience,
you have a gift for potions.

16:54.829 --> 16:56.380
It's in your blood.

16:56.414 --> 16:59.032
I'm never gonna be able
to make it as good as you.

16:59.050 --> 17:01.552
So this branch can kill
regular people, too?

17:01.586 --> 17:05.656
Anybody who touches it. But this antidote
offers protection for a few years...

17:05.656 --> 17:08.708
It's kind of like a tetanus shot...
Just in case you're re-exposed.

17:08.726 --> 17:11.162
So I'm gonna have to get Dash
and Amy to take this, too.

17:11.163 --> 17:14.268
Yes. And make sure
they drink a lot, okay?

17:14.269 --> 17:17.067
You'll know that you're cured
when your ears start ringing.

17:17.102 --> 17:18.902
- Freya?
- Huh?

17:18.936 --> 17:22.722
You're gonna save lives, like
the ass-kicking witch that you are.

17:22.740 --> 17:24.157
Okay.

17:24.192 --> 17:25.943
(exhales)

17:28.445 --> 17:30.897
(exhales)

17:34.235 --> 17:36.285
"...Interruption to
his father and mother,

17:36.286 --> 17:41.125
"how patiently and kindly so ever
they might endure it for his sake..."

17:43.177 --> 17:45.821
- Ingrid!
- Athena!

17:45.837 --> 17:47.581
Oh...

17:47.599 --> 17:51.108
You missed dinner. And you said
you were going to braid my hair.

17:51.109 --> 17:55.105
I know. I couldn't get away. I'm sorry,
but I'll braid it tomorrow.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.890
- Promise?
- Mm-hmm.

17:56.924 --> 17:58.892
Go get ready
for bed, dear.

17:58.926 --> 18:02.112
Good night, Daddy.
Good night, Ingrid.

18:07.285 --> 18:09.536
You were
very convincing today.

18:09.571 --> 18:11.605
I almost believed
you didn't know me.

18:11.623 --> 18:16.126
That would be
an unthinkable reality.

18:21.949 --> 18:24.501
Did you bring
the <i>feverfox</i> ?

18:28.124 --> 18:29.789
Good girl.
(chuckles)

18:29.807 --> 18:31.124
(chuckles)

18:31.142 --> 18:34.457
Calliope! Fetch Elizabeth!

18:37.298 --> 18:40.933
Elizabeth, I'm glad you decided
to go through with this.

18:40.935 --> 18:42.302
You won't regret it.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.488
Oh, I must admit
I'm a little nervous.

18:44.489 --> 18:47.608
My brother thinks you all do
the devil's work.

18:47.609 --> 18:50.027
(chuckles)
Your brother is a cretin.

18:50.111 --> 18:52.812
Ingrid and myself
are superior creatures.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.998
You're lucky we're willing
to deal with your kind at all,

18:55.033 --> 18:56.583
let alone help you
the way we are.

18:56.618 --> 18:59.653
I see you've, uh,
brought the money.

18:59.671 --> 19:01.338
This is everything I have.

19:01.372 --> 19:03.624
(chuckles)

19:05.627 --> 19:07.594
I'm not going to lie.

19:07.629 --> 19:09.513
This... will hurt.

19:09.547 --> 19:11.456
A lot.

19:16.854 --> 19:19.264
Thank you.

19:21.893 --> 19:24.695
Close your eyes

19:24.729 --> 19:27.180
and drink.

19:27.198 --> 19:32.452

Prepare Elizabeth

- AMY: Oh.

21:26.572 --> 21:28.873
Once again, you forget
a glass for me.

21:28.874 --> 21:31.008
You stick to your root beer.
You're our designated driver.

Ah, you guys all want to
pile onto my motorcycle?

21:32.894 --> 21:34.528
I said you could
use my car.

21:34.529 --> 21:36.605
Thank you for inviting me out
tonight, Freya,

21:36.606 --> 21:38.657
but I have to tell you,
I am a bit of an amateur,

21:38.658 --> 21:40.647
and I don't know if I can handle
another one of these, um...

21:40.665 --> 21:42.082
What are they called?

21:42.116 --> 21:44.387
East End Antidote...
with a twist.

21:44.388 --> 21:46.831
Right. Yeah, I'm pretty drunk
from the last three rounds.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.856
- Hogwash! We are celebrating!
- What?

21:49.874 --> 21:53.160
- Did you really just say "hogwash"?
- Okay, wait. What are we celebrating?

21:53.194 --> 21:57.030
We are celebrating the fact
that you two are about

21:57.048 --> 21:59.791
to solve that whole medical mystery
you were working on earlier.

21:59.792 --> 22:01.552
What do the other doctors say?

22:01.553 --> 22:04.247
Who else is working on it with you?
Maybe we should invite them here,

22:04.255 --> 22:05.872
maybe have a little
brainstorming session?

22:05.890 --> 22:08.809
Wow. I think
this is the most interest

22:08.843 --> 22:11.048
you've shown in my work
since the day I met you.

22:11.124 --> 22:15.144
Hey, that's not fair.
I'm always interested in your work.

22:16.620 --> 22:19.200
Hold on, hold on. I didn't
mean it like that, all right?

22:19.201 --> 22:23.774
All I meant was, is that
my job can be stressful,

22:23.775 --> 22:26.954
and I like that you are
an oasis away from all that.

22:26.988 --> 22:31.041
Okay, when I'm with you, I can be happy
and just forget about my troubles.

22:31.076 --> 22:33.744
But you know that I
care about your work.

22:33.745 --> 22:35.031
I know you do.

22:35.032 --> 22:36.964
And you don't always
want to talk about it.

22:37.659 --> 22:41.545
You're right. I don't. I'm sorry.
It just came out wrong.

22:44.361 --> 22:49.199
This is the most delicious drink
I think I've ever had.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.025
It, um... it tastes
like... sunshine.

22:52.026 --> 22:53.994
KILLIAN: Wow.
AMY: It does!

22:53.995 --> 22:56.880
All right, let me see.
Give me a sip.

22:56.955 --> 22:58.307
Mmm!

22:58.308 --> 23:00.691

- You're right. Sunshine.

23:00.692 --> 23:01.851
DASH:
Come on, don't be mad.

23:01.885 --> 23:04.520
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- I know. I just...

23:04.554 --> 23:07.824
You know I'm not just here
to take your mind off things, right?

23:07.858 --> 23:10.809
I mean, I don't want you to be
hiding your problems from me.

23:10.810 --> 23:13.084
I can handle it, whatever it
is you want to throw at me.

23:13.085 --> 23:16.203
I know. I want you to be a part
of everything in my life.

23:16.204 --> 23:19.213
Good, 'cause that's
what I want, too.

23:19.822 --> 23:22.358
All right then.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.878
- So marry me.
- What?

23:24.879 --> 23:27.297
I thought you guys were already
getting married.

23:27.298 --> 23:31.904
- See? Amy does have a PhD.
- No, no, marry me this weekend.

23:31.959 --> 23:33.942
At the courthouse
just the two of us.

23:33.943 --> 23:37.419
All right, no hassle,
no mothers-in-law, no guest list.

23:37.441 --> 23:40.295
Just us. You two can be
the witnesses.

23:43.769 --> 23:45.764
Hell, yes!

23:47.072 --> 23:51.286
- AMY: That is so romantic!
- Yeah. Congratulations.

23:51.310 --> 23:53.077
Penelope's gonna
lose her shit.

23:53.111 --> 23:54.712

- AMY: Cheers.

<i>MAN: It's last call, people!
One more round!</i>

24:02.087 --> 24:04.055
Wow. I can't believe
it's already last call.

24:04.089 --> 24:05.953
- We got to keep this party going.
- Yeah.

24:05.958 --> 24:07.308
Who wants to go back
to Fair Haven and celebrate?

24:07.309 --> 24:08.292
Let's go.

24:08.293 --> 24:09.627
- Let's do this.
- Yeah.

24:09.645 --> 24:11.062
Cheers.

24:11.096 --> 24:12.514

24:14.517 --> 24:18.269
(Archibald moaning)

24:18.852 --> 24:22.323
We should join the others.
I could use a swim.

24:22.358 --> 24:25.493
I know. I just like having
you to myself sometimes.

24:25.528 --> 24:27.412
You can have me
whenever you want

24:27.692 --> 24:30.360
as soon as you tell
your family the truth.

24:30.394 --> 24:34.748
That you love me
and you're going to be my wife.

24:34.783 --> 24:36.500
They will never
understand.

24:36.534 --> 24:39.651
They'll think you spelled me,
that I'm under your control.

24:39.652 --> 24:43.912
Hmm. As if I could control you.
You're more powerful than I am.

24:43.913 --> 24:46.447
Do they really not know
how strong you are?

24:46.448 --> 24:49.651
They know, but they also
believe you're pure evil.

24:49.652 --> 24:52.454
Hmm. And what do you think?

24:52.829 --> 24:55.765
I believe I was
sleepwalking

24:55.799 --> 24:58.101
before I met you,
and you woke me up.

24:58.135 --> 25:00.353
And when the
time is right,

25:00.387 --> 25:02.671
and we have enough
followers to our cause,

25:02.690 --> 25:05.641
we can return to
where we came from

25:05.675 --> 25:08.611
and take back what
is rightfully ours.

25:08.645 --> 25:12.624
And I will be proud to stand
beside you as your wife,

25:12.625 --> 25:15.898
and I will not be ashamed.

25:18.489 --> 25:20.856
Together, Ingrid,

25:20.874 --> 25:23.910
there's nothing we can't do.

25:26.029 --> 25:28.581
CALLIOPE: Something's
wrong with Elizabeth!

25:30.667 --> 25:32.969
She just started
shaking, and then...

25:33.003 --> 25:35.189
and then, all this blood
started pouring out!

25:35.190 --> 25:37.222
- I don't know what happened!
- INGRID: We need to do something.

25:37.223 --> 25:39.340
My mother can help.
She's an excellent healer.

25:39.341 --> 25:41.089
There's nothing to be done.
She's dead.

25:41.178 --> 25:43.012
Oh, poor woman.

25:43.046 --> 25:46.795
This is what we get for trying
to help an inferior creature.

25:48.029 --> 25:50.853
They'll blame us.
This could ruin everything.

25:50.887 --> 25:52.572
We need to get rid of her body.

25:52.606 --> 25:55.241
ARCHIBALD: We can bury her
down in the catacombs.

25:55.275 --> 25:58.578
They'll be after us now,
the ones who don't understand,

25:58.612 --> 26:00.729
but we can make this
a new beginning.

26:00.748 --> 26:04.042
- Tonight. Let's marry tonight.
- Yes.

26:05.036 --> 26:07.113
<i>MAN: Where is Elizabeth?!</i>

26:07.170 --> 26:08.810
Oh.

26:09.511 --> 26:11.178
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

26:11.212 --> 26:12.629
<i>Elizabeth?!</i>

26:12.663 --> 26:15.132
- How did you get in?
- What have you done with her?

26:15.166 --> 26:17.851
You have no right to be here.
Be gone. Your sister is fine.

26:17.886 --> 26:21.355
- Then show her to me.
- You sister has a right to be left alone.

26:21.389 --> 26:25.275
Oh. The good people
of this town are on to you.

26:25.310 --> 26:27.277
We know
you're doing the devil's work.

26:27.312 --> 26:29.879
You have no idea what you're
talking about. You need to leave.

26:29.898 --> 26:31.365
Fine.

26:31.399 --> 26:33.367
Then I will take my sister
with me,

26:33.401 --> 26:37.233
or I will return with 20 men,
and we will take her ourselves.

26:37.244 --> 26:38.546
Elizabeth is dead.

26:39.908 --> 26:41.325
She wanted to be young.

26:41.359 --> 26:43.877
I granted her wish.
It didn't work out.

26:43.912 --> 26:45.528
You killed her?!

26:45.547 --> 26:49.399
It was an unfortunate
turn of events.

26:50.919 --> 26:53.337
And now you're going to kill me?

26:53.371 --> 26:56.006
I have no intention
of killing you.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.524
(grunts)

26:57.525 --> 26:59.693
My soon-to-be-wife will do it.

26:59.894 --> 27:02.229
Archibald?

27:02.263 --> 27:03.897
(panting)

27:03.932 --> 27:05.882
Think of it
as a wedding gift.

27:06.873 --> 27:08.279
I...

27:08.479 --> 27:10.304
Please.

27:11.389 --> 27:13.023
(grunts) (gasps)

27:13.596 --> 27:16.064
You disappoint me, Ingrid.

27:24.512 --> 27:25.896
(laughter)

27:27.271 --> 27:31.157
DASH: Ooh, wow.
Whoa! It's freezing.

27:31.192 --> 27:34.027
<i>Calor Aqua.</i>

27:35.550 --> 27:37.351
Feels kind of
warm to me.

27:37.352 --> 27:39.489
Huh. Must have been
in a cold spot or something.

27:39.817 --> 27:42.986
AMY: Oh! That drink really
did a number on me.

27:43.004 --> 27:45.313
- My ears are ringing.
- Me, too.

27:45.314 --> 27:47.769
Me, too. That's good.
It means it's working.

27:48.068 --> 27:50.114
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

27:50.115 --> 27:53.632
I love this room.
It's so...

27:53.665 --> 27:54.998
Creepy?

27:55.165 --> 27:57.307
- You think?
- Oh, definitely creepy.

27:57.308 --> 27:59.910
They used to have Satanic
sex rituals here, you know.

28:02.807 --> 28:05.108
DASH: All right, you want creepy.
You know, the workers

28:05.142 --> 28:07.644
just found an entrance to some
catacombs underneath the house.

28:07.678 --> 28:11.101
- I haven't even checked that out yet.
- Oh, cool. Let's go.

28:37.292 --> 28:38.509
What are you doing?

28:38.660 --> 28:42.562
- I didn't think you were here.
- Don't do this.

28:42.939 --> 28:45.197
Don't do what? I'm just
getting some things.

28:45.198 --> 28:47.734
I'm taking a trip
to visit Freya in San Francisco.

28:47.735 --> 28:51.030
- You're wearing a wedding dress.
- Yes, but it's not what it looks like.

28:51.031 --> 28:53.533
Ingrid, stop. I know
about you and Archibald.

28:53.651 --> 28:55.602
I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:55.620 --> 28:59.066
I thought it was a phase.
I had no idea you were in so deep.

28:59.067 --> 29:02.025
Ingrid, he doesn't care about you.
He's using you.

29:02.026 --> 29:05.245
He went after me first, and I didn't
fall for it. You shouldn't, either.

29:05.250 --> 29:07.635
Why are you lying like this?

29:07.670 --> 29:10.066
Ingrid, you can't marry him.
He doesn't love you!

29:10.067 --> 29:11.659
Just because you use men,

29:11.660 --> 29:13.341
and just because
you only care about yourself

29:13.342 --> 29:15.024
doesn't mean
everybody is like you.

29:15.025 --> 29:17.353
You're right, he's not
like me. He's evil.

29:17.354 --> 29:19.514
He cares about our kind.

29:19.548 --> 29:23.017
He doesn't want us to have to hide
anymore. He's proud of what we are.

29:23.018 --> 29:25.546
So we're going to a place
where nobody can hurt us.

29:25.547 --> 29:27.345
Such a place doesn't exist!

29:27.346 --> 29:30.017
If they find out what we are,
they will always hurt us.

29:30.018 --> 29:32.103
Not if we go back to
where we came from!

29:32.111 --> 29:35.062
- Archibald has found a way through.
- He's lying.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.999
We're leaving tonight
after we're married.

29:38.033 --> 29:40.535
I'm sorry, Wendy.

29:44.674 --> 29:48.543
Yeah, the workmen say this place is
basically unchanged since it was built.

29:48.577 --> 29:50.523
AMY:
Well, I don't like it.

29:50.524 --> 29:52.513
What, are you afraid
we'll see a ghost?

29:52.548 --> 29:54.415
I'm pretty sure
we're gonna see a rat.

29:54.433 --> 29:56.100
I hate rats.

29:56.135 --> 29:58.586
(Freya sighs)

30:02.307 --> 30:05.276
- You all right?
- Yeah. I think I'm a little drunk.

30:05.310 --> 30:06.778
I <i>know</i> you're drunk.

30:06.812 --> 30:08.929
But I like drunk Freya...
she's fun.

30:08.947 --> 30:10.698
Yeah, but drunk Freya
has a tendency

30:10.733 --> 30:13.785
to do stupid things
she regrets the next day.

30:13.942 --> 30:16.160
You talking
about the engagement party?

30:16.194 --> 30:18.729
'Cause I don't think
you were drunk then.

30:18.747 --> 30:21.064
Yeah, probably not.

30:22.784 --> 30:24.585
So...

30:24.619 --> 30:28.238
So, did you really have a dream about me
before you met me that night?

30:29.257 --> 30:30.875
That's weird, right?

30:30.909 --> 30:34.044
We both have dreams
about each other before we met.

30:34.201 --> 30:36.536
Why have we never
talked about that?

30:36.554 --> 30:38.872
There are a lot of things
we don't talk about.

30:42.817 --> 30:47.137
- I'm sorry if I ever hurt you.
- Oh, no. Don't worry about it.

30:47.171 --> 30:50.473
- We're good.
- Okay.

30:50.507 --> 30:52.025
Good.

30:52.305 --> 30:55.757
And congratulations
on the whole...

30:55.775 --> 30:57.860
eloping thing...
I think that's great.

30:57.894 --> 31:02.115
- I hope you guys are really happy.
- Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

31:06.152 --> 31:09.966
Anyway, I'm gonna go check on Amy, in
case she runs into any of those...

35:48.388 --> 35:50.372
(speaks spell)

35:50.390 --> 35:52.675
(crying, groaning)

35:53.710 --> 35:56.145
(Athena crying quietly)

35:56.180 --> 35:59.048
Freya will be dead
by morning.

35:59.066 --> 36:01.810
They always die on the same day.

36:01.811 --> 36:04.270
It was an accident.

36:04.271 --> 36:07.657
I was trying to protect her.
She was gonna run away with him.

36:07.691 --> 36:10.743
Did you know that she
was in love with him?

36:10.777 --> 36:14.330
(panting):
I'm sorry.

36:14.364 --> 36:16.499
If you had told me...

36:16.533 --> 36:20.786
she was in love with him, then
together we could have saved her.

36:21.788 --> 36:24.999
And instead, you've
killed them both.

36:25.025 --> 36:27.409
You know I would never
hurt the girls on purpose.

36:27.427 --> 36:31.047
But you did hurt them, because
you're reckless and dangerous

36:31.081 --> 36:33.082
and you act without thinking.

36:37.604 --> 36:39.772
(panting)

36:39.806 --> 36:41.590
Get out.

36:43.677 --> 36:46.679
I never want to
see you again.

36:52.819 --> 36:54.537
(door closes)

36:54.571 --> 36:58.255
And... that was it.

36:58.465 --> 37:02.968
I didn't see Wendy again until
she turned up on our porch a month ago.

37:03.501 --> 37:06.637
And... what happened to Athena?

37:06.671 --> 37:10.674
She left town with two women
from Archibald's coven.

37:10.708 --> 37:14.574
I spelled them so they could
never find East End again.

37:14.575 --> 37:17.127
I tracked her for years.

37:17.682 --> 37:20.884
And she died in the early 1960s.

37:21.550 --> 37:24.218
(softly):
I loved that little girl.

37:25.023 --> 37:27.574
I loved Archibald, too.

37:27.608 --> 37:30.393
That spell was so real.

37:30.411 --> 37:35.565
It was like I lived through it
all again in a matter of hours.

37:35.583 --> 37:39.252
I could smell and taste everything.
I was <i>there.</i>

37:40.621 --> 37:45.676
But I still can't understand it. How
could I have gotten so out of control?

37:45.710 --> 37:51.765
We all have darkness inside of us,
Ingrid, even the best of us.

37:51.799 --> 37:53.934
Even you.

37:55.452 --> 37:57.452
(door opens)

37:57.478 --> 38:01.897
- FREYA: Guys, we have a problem.
- Besides all the other problems?

38:01.898 --> 38:05.428
There's an entire wall of <i>ramus mortium</i>
in the catacombs of Fair Haven.

38:05.446 --> 38:09.032
- An entire wall?
- What the hell is <i>ramus mortium?</i>

38:09.067 --> 38:11.252
- What are we gonna do?
- Has anyone else seen it?

38:11.253 --> 38:12.494
No.

38:12.570 --> 38:15.956
Then we need to do something
about it before somebody does.

38:16.407 --> 38:19.576
(liquid dripping)

38:24.832 --> 38:26.800
(soft gasp)

38:26.834 --> 38:28.668
Whoa.

38:51.625 --> 38:54.010
(birds chirping)

38:55.874 --> 38:58.092
Hey, sweetie, want
to grab some breakfast?

38:58.118 --> 39:01.461
No. Uh, thanks.
I should get to work.

39:01.496 --> 39:04.465
- Are you okay?
- Yes, fine.

39:04.499 --> 39:06.834
I'll see you later.

39:08.094 --> 39:10.562
♪

39:11.539 --> 39:13.891
(exhales)

39:14.050 --> 39:17.027
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

39:17.316 --> 39:20.413
- Are you as hungover as I am?
- So much more.

39:21.099 --> 39:24.351
- Crazy night, huh?
- Very crazy.

39:24.385 --> 39:28.739
Hey. Babe, I kind of want to talk to you
about the whole elopement thing.

39:28.740 --> 39:32.627
- Yeah. Yeah, I think we should wait.
- Me, too.

39:32.628 --> 39:34.929
Yeah, if we're gonna do
it, let's do it right.

39:34.930 --> 39:37.074
We'll have a real wedding,
with family and friends.

39:37.108 --> 39:38.957
That's exactly
what I was gonna say.

39:38.962 --> 39:41.743
You see? That's why
we're made for each other.

39:43.665 --> 39:46.467
PENELOPE: Freya?
(soft groan)

39:46.864 --> 39:49.333
What's this I hear
about an elopement?

39:49.334 --> 39:51.113
Well, actually,
we're gonna wait.

39:51.114 --> 39:53.549
We're gonna do it here,
make it big and splashy.

39:53.583 --> 39:55.751
Tell the world how we
feel about each other.

39:55.785 --> 39:58.283
Oh, good. I'm glad
you're gonna do it right.

39:58.559 --> 40:03.196
You and your family mean
so much to me, Freya.

40:03.197 --> 40:05.915
I have big plans for you.

40:06.184 --> 40:09.519
It's going to be wonderful.

40:09.553 --> 40:11.154
I am so excited.
