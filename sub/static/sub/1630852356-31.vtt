WEBVTT

00:01.588 --> 00:03.024
[glass squeaks]

00:03.067 --> 00:05.809
[breathing heavily]

00:05.853 --> 00:07.289
[inhales deeply]

00:07.332 --> 00:09.639
Oh,
man. Y'all are nevergoing to believe this.

00:09.683 --> 00:12.207
Big City is throwinga huge street fair,

00:12.250 --> 00:14.818
and it's right around the
cornerfrom our house.

00:14.862 --> 00:16.951
I'm gonna get inthe
first bounce house I see

00:16.994 --> 00:18.692
and just go wild.

00:18.735 --> 00:20.496
I'm going to buy a funnel cake
and then use it

00:20.520 --> 00:22.043
for its one true purpose:

00:22.086 --> 00:25.568
funneling an entire slushie
directly into my face.

00:25.612 --> 00:27.352
Last time, I spent
all Bill's money

00:27.396 --> 00:28.963
trying to win the ring toss.

00:29.006 --> 00:31.400
But this time,
I'm coming prepared.

00:31.443 --> 00:33.576
Okay. I'm just goingto
hit up the ATM real quick,

00:33.620 --> 00:34.925
and then we can go.

00:34.969 --> 00:36.579
Hey, Dad, we're going
to the street fair,

00:36.623 --> 00:38.407
so why don't you slapa few big bucks

00:38.450 --> 00:40.583
in my tiny hands, please?

00:40.627 --> 00:42.454
Uh... no?

00:42.498 --> 00:44.195
- Huh?
- I said, no.

00:44.239 --> 00:46.589
Papa, I think you said "yes" wrong.

00:46.633 --> 00:48.243
No, I meant what I said.

00:48.286 --> 00:50.482
I think we should all stay here
and have a quiet night in.

00:50.506 --> 00:52.421
[all laugh]

00:53.857 --> 00:55.467
Good one, Dad.

00:55.511 --> 00:57.426
But, uh... money?

00:57.469 --> 00:58.949
Dang it, Cricket, I'm serious.

00:58.993 --> 01:00.840
Our production costs have
been through the roof.

01:00.864 --> 01:02.518
Production costs?

01:02.562 --> 01:03.887
Yeah. That's what I call money
we spend

01:03.911 --> 01:06.261
on producing fun for ourselves.

01:06.304 --> 01:08.480
You know, things like
restaurants, movies,

01:08.524 --> 01:11.614
fancy shoes that a certain
someone never wears.

01:11.658 --> 01:13.224
I just don't want
to get them dirty.

01:13.268 --> 01:14.704
So if we can'tgo to the fair,

01:14.748 --> 01:17.141
what the heckare we supposed to do?

01:17.185 --> 01:19.535
Well, there's plenty to do
right here in the living room.

01:19.579 --> 01:22.146
We can just re-use the assets
we already have.

01:22.190 --> 01:24.018
- Assets?
- [sighs]

01:24.061 --> 01:25.952
Just think of it this way.
Why go on new adventures,

01:25.976 --> 01:27.543
when you can remember
the old ones?

01:27.587 --> 01:29.501
We spent a lot of money
making those memories.

01:29.545 --> 01:31.654
We might as well get more use
out of them, right, gang?

01:31.678 --> 01:33.854
- [all grumble]
- I'll go first.

01:33.897 --> 01:36.639
Remember when we went to that
fancy seafood restaurant?

01:36.683 --> 01:39.947
[Cricket]
We didn't have restaurants
like this back in the country.

01:39.990 --> 01:43.254
Okay, fella, back to where
you belong.

01:43.298 --> 01:44.865
Aah!

01:44.908 --> 01:46.910
[grunts]

01:48.608 --> 01:49.870
[all scream]

01:49.913 --> 01:51.349
[Gramma]
Grab on!

01:51.393 --> 01:54.657
We did it, Tilly. We're hero... oh,
my goodness.

01:54.701 --> 01:57.878
- [gasps and angry chatter]
- [man] Disgusting!

01:57.921 --> 02:00.663
You and your familyare banned for life!

02:00.707 --> 02:01.969
-I'm so sorry--
-Get out!

02:02.012 --> 02:03.318
Ah!

02:03.361 --> 02:05.755
[all panting]

02:05.799 --> 02:08.802
That sure was expensive.
But remembering it is free.

02:08.845 --> 02:11.369
Ah! This is like one of those
TV episodes

02:11.413 --> 02:13.720
where the cheap producers
reuse old clips,

02:13.763 --> 02:16.766
because they're too lazy
to write new stuff.

02:16.810 --> 02:18.812
I think it sounds
pretty resourceful.

02:20.857 --> 02:23.381
So, does anyone else care
towindow-shop down memory lane?

02:23.425 --> 02:25.209
Fine, I'll go.

02:25.253 --> 02:28.822
Y'all remember that time the
robot dinosaur almost ate us?

02:28.865 --> 02:30.737
- [both] Oh, yeah.
- Wait what?

02:30.780 --> 02:32.826
I remember it perfectly.

02:33.870 --> 02:34.915
[roars]

02:34.958 --> 02:37.439
- I love eating cars!
- Oh, toots.

02:37.482 --> 02:39.920
Well, the the sight
of that dinosaur made me sad.

02:39.963 --> 02:42.836
Time to shake my head,
then drive with my face.

02:42.879 --> 02:44.620
Cricket. Cricket, Cricket.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.535
Cricket. Cricket,
Cricket, Cricket, Cricket.

02:46.578 --> 02:47.710
Glove.

02:47.754 --> 02:49.016
It's for you.

02:49.059 --> 02:50.887
I get a word in when I can.

02:50.931 --> 02:53.847
Aw, I am no longer sad. Hug.

02:53.890 --> 02:55.979
[loud crash]

02:56.023 --> 02:58.112
I'm hungry!

02:58.155 --> 03:00.505
Oh, no, this stinks!

03:00.549 --> 03:03.030
And nothing bad happened
to Bill's truck. The end.

03:03.073 --> 03:05.902
Wait, did the dinosaur talk?
I feel like I'd remember that.

03:05.946 --> 03:08.731
Well, I'm sorry my old
dump truck of a brain

03:08.775 --> 03:10.820
can't remember it word for word.

03:10.864 --> 03:12.343
If you're going
to sass me about it,

03:12.387 --> 03:13.780
why don't you tell a story?

03:13.823 --> 03:15.738
All right! Jeez. Uh...

03:15.782 --> 03:19.046
Oh! Hey, y'all remember
that funny thing Weezie said?

03:19.089 --> 03:21.744
Ha-ha! Got to get it to have it.

03:21.788 --> 03:23.615
Actually, I think he said...

03:23.659 --> 03:25.792
All noodles, no spaghetti.

03:25.835 --> 03:27.489
No, he definitely said...

03:27.532 --> 03:29.752
Little steps, big toes.

03:29.796 --> 03:32.450
Wait, I thought I said
the funny thing.

03:32.494 --> 03:34.888
Slap it up, slap it in.

03:34.931 --> 03:36.324
- No, no, no, no.
- Definitely not.

03:36.367 --> 03:38.935
- That don't sound right.
- Here, I have a story.

03:38.979 --> 03:40.913
I went on an adventure
I've never told y'all about.

03:40.937 --> 03:44.724
Packed with action,
exotic locales and new faces.

03:44.767 --> 03:48.858
There I was,
taking a stroll in Little Tokyo.

03:48.902 --> 03:50.904
The sakura were in full bloom.

03:50.947 --> 03:52.340
But even their sweet scent

03:52.383 --> 03:54.777
couldn't mask the stench
of evil.

03:54.821 --> 03:56.823
Hold up. What's all this?

03:56.866 --> 03:59.477
Hm? Oh, this is a storyboard.

03:59.521 --> 04:01.871
Storyboard?

04:01.915 --> 04:03.351
It's a board with a story on it?

04:03.394 --> 04:05.875
Come on, Cricket,
context clues. Keep up.

04:05.919 --> 04:08.138
Anyways, I had just
finished my mochi,

04:08.182 --> 04:11.794
when I saw a giant monster
attacking the city.

04:11.838 --> 04:14.623
Just then a man ran up
to me with a briefcase.

04:14.666 --> 04:16.843
He said something in Japanese.

04:16.886 --> 04:19.759
[speaking Japanese]

04:19.802 --> 04:22.283
And it was in that moment
I knew what I had to do.

04:22.326 --> 04:23.850
[gasps]

04:23.893 --> 04:25.503
[roaring]

04:26.896 --> 04:29.899
I was ready for the fight
of my life.

04:32.902 --> 04:35.818
And after an incredible,
dramatic, complex battle,

04:35.862 --> 04:36.906
I defeated the beast.

04:36.950 --> 04:38.255
Yatta!

04:38.299 --> 04:39.779
The end.

04:39.822 --> 04:41.128
Well, that would've been great

04:41.171 --> 04:42.738
if it wasn't a board story,
or whatever.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.696
You could have at least
colored it.

04:44.740 --> 04:46.829
That didn't actually happen,
did it?

04:46.873 --> 04:48.744
No.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.746
- Hm.
- [cell phone vibrates]

04:50.790 --> 04:52.376
- Oh, hey, Nancy.
- [Nancy, on phone] Hey, Bill.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.315
I'm at the street fair.
You guys coming?

04:54.358 --> 04:56.752
Oh, no, we just decided
to have a relaxing night in.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.537
Mom? We're dying here.
Please, what's it like?

04:59.581 --> 05:00.843
I must know.

05:00.887 --> 05:02.018
Oh, my gosh, well...

05:02.062 --> 05:03.715
It's like, there's...

05:03.759 --> 05:06.718
Honestly, it's...
it's indescribable.

05:06.762 --> 05:09.156
Please, Mama. Describe anything.

05:09.199 --> 05:10.940
How's the cotton candy?

05:10.984 --> 05:14.552
Oh, man, where do I start?
It's so... pink.

05:14.596 --> 05:15.727
- Oh!
- Oh!

05:15.771 --> 05:17.033
Talk to you later, Nance.

05:17.077 --> 05:19.209
Yeah, yeah, later.

05:19.253 --> 05:21.168
I can't take this.

05:21.211 --> 05:22.822
I need to experience
something new

05:22.865 --> 05:24.998
with an actual location
and people.

05:25.041 --> 05:26.347
Oh, I got a story.

05:26.390 --> 05:27.783
Did I ever tell you
about the time

05:27.827 --> 05:29.611
I went back to that fancy
seafood restaurant?

05:29.654 --> 05:31.743
[humming]

05:31.787 --> 05:33.745
- [Lloyd] Leave.
- [Bill] Yup.

05:33.789 --> 05:36.009
[humming]

05:36.052 --> 05:38.707
When they said banned for life,
they meant it.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.535
I am done reminiscing.

05:40.578 --> 05:41.928
Okay, okay.

05:41.971 --> 05:43.581
How about we all just
take a moment

05:43.625 --> 05:45.018
to be alone with our thoughts?

05:45.061 --> 05:46.367
Dad, that's even worse.

05:46.410 --> 05:47.847
I can't hear you.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.718
I've retreated
into the Bill-scape.

05:49.761 --> 05:51.763
Hm, could be fun.
I'll give it a try.

05:51.807 --> 05:54.375
Hey, brain, give me a list
of things to think about.

05:54.418 --> 05:56.681
Sure thing.
Rocks. Balloons.

05:56.725 --> 05:59.293
World problems.
Battleship names.

05:59.336 --> 06:01.904
[Gramma]
Ah, finally alone
with my thoughts.

06:01.948 --> 06:04.037
Hm, a little quiet in here.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.822
[sputters lips and gibbers]

06:08.955 --> 06:10.913
That's more like it.

06:10.957 --> 06:12.915
[Cricket]
This is so dumb.

06:12.959 --> 06:15.831
Who hears "fun" and thinks,
"Oh, I'll sit in silence"?

06:15.875 --> 06:18.790
[Bill] All right, Bill,
you bought some time.
But this won't last long.

06:18.834 --> 06:21.315
You gotta think of something
to entertain them with, and fast.

06:21.358 --> 06:24.884
Oh, I know.
I will come up with a joke.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.886
[Tilly]
Books. Tattoo ideas. Animals.

06:26.929 --> 06:28.409
Oh, animals, please.

06:28.452 --> 06:29.845
Coming right up.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.543
Anteaters, praying mantises,
ferrets...

06:32.587 --> 06:33.893
[Gramma blathering]

06:36.896 --> 06:38.854
[Bill]
Ugh! Joke-writing is hard.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.900
How about one where
the punch line is "corn"?

06:40.943 --> 06:43.685
Corny? Is that something? Aah!

06:43.728 --> 06:45.861
[Cricket]
Ugh, guess this is what
we're doing now.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.081
Has been a while since
I gave the old brain a whirl.

06:48.124 --> 06:49.909
All right, brain,
what you got for me?

06:49.952 --> 06:51.562
People don't find
your wacky antics

06:51.606 --> 06:53.042
as endearing as you think.

06:53.086 --> 06:54.696
Nope! I'm done.

06:54.739 --> 06:57.177
Wait, wait,
I have a knock-knock joke.

06:57.220 --> 06:59.962
Who's there? Dang it!

07:00.006 --> 07:01.921
Well, if we're just going
to sit around all day,

07:01.964 --> 07:03.313
we might as well watch some TV.

07:04.836 --> 07:07.491
- [static crackles]
- Father. Explain.

07:07.535 --> 07:08.928
I cut the cable.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.712
[laughing]
Is that all?

07:10.755 --> 07:12.932
That's really cool.
For a second, I--

07:12.975 --> 07:14.759
[screams and grunts]

07:14.803 --> 07:16.761
Calm down, boy.
Now's not the time.

07:16.805 --> 07:18.807
Dad, what where you thinking?

07:18.850 --> 07:21.114
Now how am I supposedto
watch my favorite show,

07:21.157 --> 07:23.203
Little Country Blues?

07:23.246 --> 07:24.789
It was the easiest wayto save some money.

07:24.813 --> 07:26.162
Back me up, sweetie.

07:26.206 --> 07:28.338
Well, we still have streaming,
right?

07:28.382 --> 07:30.906
- Ad-supported.
- [shrieks]

07:30.950 --> 07:33.082
Save your strength,
Tilly. He ain't worth it.

07:33.126 --> 07:35.519
Hm. You've been spared.

07:35.563 --> 07:37.304
I was just trying
to save us money.

07:37.347 --> 07:39.567
- Someone's got to.
- It's a slippery slope, Bill.

07:39.610 --> 07:40.916
What's next?

07:40.960 --> 07:43.005
You going to install a timer
on the electricity

07:43.049 --> 07:45.790
so it automatically
shuts off every night?

07:45.834 --> 07:46.922
Uh...

07:46.966 --> 07:48.924
would you believe me
if I said no?

07:48.968 --> 07:50.926
[Cricket] Why would you
cut the power at night?

07:50.970 --> 07:51.990
That's when we need it the most.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.276
[Bill]
I don't know.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.930
I thought we'd be asleep by now.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.150
[Tilly]
Papa, it is 6:00 p.m.

07:57.193 --> 07:58.542
[Bill]
I'm feeling pretty sleepy.

07:58.586 --> 08:00.153
[Cricket]
Listen up, old man.

08:00.196 --> 08:02.285
I'm about to go ham bananas
on this house,

08:02.329 --> 08:04.809
and I am not stopping
until the lights are on

08:04.853 --> 08:06.289
and the cable is back.

08:06.333 --> 08:08.267
- You hear me? Huh? Huh?
- [Bill] Cricket, please.

08:08.291 --> 08:10.815
- [loud crash]
- What was that?

08:10.859 --> 08:12.643
[Cricket]
Don't worry about it, Billiam.

08:12.687 --> 08:14.210
[screams]

08:14.254 --> 08:16.188
-[Gramma] Slow down.-[Bill] Oh,
jeez, he's lost it.

08:16.212 --> 08:17.822
[Gramma]
Take cover!

08:17.866 --> 08:19.824
- [Cricket screaming]
- [objects crashing]

08:23.915 --> 08:25.067
[Bill]
Okay, I think he's done.

08:25.091 --> 08:26.962
-Should be safe to--
-[Cricket screams]

08:27.006 --> 08:29.921
[Bill]
Cricket, I'm begging you,
please stop.

08:29.965 --> 08:31.184
[Cricket]
I can't stop.

08:31.227 --> 08:33.838
The people at home
expect entertainment.

08:33.882 --> 08:35.425
- [Bill] What people at home?
- [Cricket] Us!

08:35.449 --> 08:37.886
The people in this home!

08:37.929 --> 08:39.844
[Gramma]
Dang it, this is getting
out of hand.

08:39.888 --> 08:42.064
[Bill] Okay, fine,
I'll get the lights back on.

08:42.108 --> 08:44.327
- [crowd cheering]
- [loud music blaring]

08:44.371 --> 08:45.850
All right, power's back.

08:45.894 --> 08:47.809
Hope the damage
isn't too expensive to draw--

08:47.852 --> 08:49.941
Huh, nothing's broken?

08:49.985 --> 08:51.769
Sounded like it was a lot worse.

08:51.813 --> 08:53.945
Yeah, but Cricket did break
the fourth wall.

08:53.989 --> 08:55.860
- The what?
- The fourth wall.

08:55.904 --> 08:57.601
Look.

08:57.645 --> 08:59.647
See? He put a huge hole in it.

08:59.690 --> 09:01.475
What? Y'all don't number
the walls?

09:01.518 --> 09:02.954
Okay, listen, everyone.

09:02.998 --> 09:04.798
I may have gotten
a little carried away today.

09:04.826 --> 09:06.934
I was worried you kids didn't
know the value of a dollar.

09:06.958 --> 09:09.135
So I thought I'd show you
that you don't need

09:09.178 --> 09:10.875
to spend money to have fun.

09:10.919 --> 09:12.921
I guess we were
pretty thirsty for that cash.

09:12.964 --> 09:16.185
But the fact is, Bill,
we didn't have any fun today.

09:16.229 --> 09:18.535
Listen, Dad, expensive things
can be fun,

09:18.579 --> 09:21.234
but fun things
don't have to be expensive.

09:21.277 --> 09:23.236
Huh. You may be onto
something there.

09:23.279 --> 09:25.020
So how about a compromise?

09:25.064 --> 09:27.196
We go to the street fair,
but we don't buy anything.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.416
Yeah. Instead of drinking
a slushie,

09:29.459 --> 09:31.809
I will drink in the atmosphere.

09:31.853 --> 09:33.594
And instead of playingring toss,

09:33.637 --> 09:36.597
I'll just heckle other
peoplewhile they play.

09:36.640 --> 09:37.902
That's priceless.

09:37.946 --> 09:38.990
How's that sound, big guy?

09:39.034 --> 09:40.818
[gasps]
Such frugality.

09:40.862 --> 09:42.820
That sounds great.

09:42.864 --> 09:44.822
Okay, y'all go have some fun.

09:44.866 --> 09:45.954
- Yay!
- Let's go!

09:45.997 --> 09:48.652
Hey, wait.
Aren't you coming?

09:48.696 --> 09:51.002
Huh? Oh, no,
I'll be fine here.

09:51.046 --> 09:52.743
- What?
- You gotta come with us!

09:52.787 --> 09:54.136
[excited chatter]

09:54.180 --> 09:56.225
Nah. There's a hole.

09:56.269 --> 09:57.879
[overlapped chatter]

09:57.922 --> 09:59.098
Come on, Dad.

10:00.882 --> 10:02.013
Okay!

10:02.057 --> 10:03.928
- Let's do it.
- [all cheer]

10:03.972 --> 10:05.669
[door opens and closes]

10:05.713 --> 10:07.062
[Cricket]
Oh, wow, look at that.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.672
A roller coaster.

10:08.716 --> 10:11.022
[Tilly]
So technically impressive.

10:11.066 --> 10:13.024
[Bill] I've never seen
such a big crowd before.

10:13.068 --> 10:14.896
[Nancy]
Oh, hey, guys, you made it.

10:14.939 --> 10:16.743
-[Tilly & Cricket] Mom!-[Cricket]
You were right, Mom.

10:16.767 --> 10:18.745
- This place is hard to describe.
- [Nancy] Told you.

10:18.769 --> 10:20.902
[Bill]
Kids, look, a celebrity.

10:20.945 --> 10:22.121
[Tom Hanks]
Hey, Green family.

10:22.164 --> 10:24.210
It's me, Tom Hanks.

10:24.253 --> 10:26.081
I'm about to go on
an incredible adventure,

10:26.125 --> 10:27.972
and I'd love to have you all
come along with me.

10:27.996 --> 10:30.477
