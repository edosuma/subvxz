WEBVTT

00:00.833 --> 00:02.200
- HEY, DEB.

00:02.200 --> 00:03.800
WHAT, ARE YOU WRAPPING
CHRISTMAS PRESENTS?

00:03.800 --> 00:06.767
- YEAH.
- TIE, HUH? WHOA, JAZZY.

00:06.767 --> 00:08.300
- YEAH, IT'S FOR RAY.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.267
- HEY, EVERYBODY.

00:11.900 --> 00:15.367
- HEY, MY BROTHER!

00:15.367 --> 00:17.733
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
MY BROTHER.

00:17.733 --> 00:19.167
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

00:19.167 --> 00:24.833
DON'T EVER DO THAT
UNLESS I'M ON FIRE.

00:24.833 --> 00:27.433
EVEN THEN, ASK FIRST.

00:27.433 --> 00:30.200
- SO ARE WE GOING AWAY
ON A GOLF WEEKEND OR WHAT?

00:30.200 --> 00:31.667
- YES, WE ARE.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.433
I SPOKE TO MY CONNECTION
IN MYRTLE BEACH.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.600
HE PULLED A COUPLE STRINGS.
WE'RE IN.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.300
- OH, THIS IS GOING
TO BE BEAUTIFUL.

00:37.300 --> 00:40.900
I'M GOING TO BUY
A NEW PAIR OF PLAID PANTS.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.967
- I JUST GOT TO CHECK
A COUPLE THINGS OUT FIRST.

00:43.967 --> 00:46.367
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT?
YOU SAID WE'RE IN.

00:46.367 --> 00:48.800
YOU HAVEN'T ASKED DEBRA YET,
HAVE YOU?

00:48.800 --> 00:50.633
- NOT YET, BUT I'M JUST--

00:50.633 --> 00:52.500
I'M LAYING
THE FOUNDATION, OKAY?

00:52.500 --> 00:54.533
IT'S A WHOLE PROCESS, MAN.

00:54.533 --> 00:56.133
- YOU GOT TO
MAKE THIS HAPPEN FOR ME.

00:56.133 --> 00:58.333
COME ON, I NEED SOMETHING
TO LOOK FORWARD TO

00:58.333 --> 01:00.267
IN MY SOUP-FOR-ONE LIFE.

01:00.267 --> 01:01.833
- I KNOW. I KNOW.
LOOK, IT JUST--

01:01.833 --> 01:04.233
IT REQUIRES
A LITTLE FINAGLING, THAT'S ALL.

01:04.233 --> 01:06.567
- OH, GOD, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

01:06.567 --> 01:09.733
- DON'T WORRY
YOUR LARGE RECTANGULAR HEAD.

01:13.133 --> 01:15.033
- OKAY, I GOT TO GO
PICK UP THE KIDS.

01:15.033 --> 01:19.267
- HEY, DEB. HI.
AW, YOU LOOK NICE.

01:19.267 --> 01:20.600
- OH, I'M TOTALLY GROSS.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.400
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO SHOWER YET.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.100
- AH, YOU'D NEVER KNOW IT.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.400
HEY, WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.633
WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR CHRISTMAS?
- HONEY, I GOT TO GO.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.400
- WAIT, WAIT.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.667
WHAT DO I GET THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN IN THE WORLD?

01:36.667 --> 01:39.600
- [mumbling]

01:39.600 --> 01:41.233
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE WANTS,

01:41.233 --> 01:44.800
BUT I COULD USE
A CROCK-POT.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.067
- CROCK-POT?
- YEAH.

01:46.067 --> 01:47.367
- OH, BECAUSE
OF THE MELTED CRAYONS?

01:47.367 --> 01:49.233
- YEAH.
- YEAH, THAT WAS ALLY'S IDEA.

01:49.233 --> 01:52.767
- YEAH?
SHE SAID IT WAS DADDY'S.

01:52.767 --> 01:57.067
- WELL, THEN SHE'S
A LITTLE LIAR, ISN'T SHE?

01:58.667 --> 01:59.900
[door closes]

01:59.900 --> 02:02.633
- MAYBE I'LL SEE MYRTLE BEACH
FROM HEAVEN.

02:02.633 --> 02:04.533
- RELAX, MAN.
I'M WORKING ON IT.

02:04.533 --> 02:06.400
OKAY, I JUST GOT
SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.800
- WHAT, YOU SUCK AT FINAGLING?

02:08.800 --> 02:11.533
- NO.
CROCK-POT.

02:11.533 --> 02:13.600
- OH, RIGHT. SHE'S GOING TO LET
YOU GO ON A GOLF WEEKEND

02:13.600 --> 02:15.200
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING HER
A CROCK-POT.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.600
- NO, YOU IDIOT.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.233
I'M NOT GOING
TO GET A CROCK-POT, OKAY?

02:18.233 --> 02:19.433
A CROCK-POT
JUST SETS THE LEVEL.

02:19.433 --> 02:21.167
I HAVE TO WORK ABOVE THAT.

02:21.167 --> 02:23.800
I GOTTA GET HER SOMETHING THAT'S
GOING TO TURN HER ALL GOOPY,

02:23.800 --> 02:27.133
AND IT HAS TO BE BETTER
THAN WHAT SHE'S GETTING ME.

02:27.133 --> 02:30.400
- OH, OH, I KNOW
WHAT SHE'S GETTING YOU!

02:30.400 --> 02:32.567
- WHAT? WHAT?
COME ON. WHAT?

02:32.567 --> 02:35.900
- IT'S A CHRISTMAS PRESENT.
I CAN'T RUIN IT.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.933
- HEY, YOU WANT TO GO
TO MYRTLE BEACH OR NOT, HUH?

02:37.933 --> 02:42.233
I'M FINAGLING HERE.
YOU'RE IMPEDING THE FINAGLE.

02:42.233 --> 02:45.300
- IT'S A TIE.
SHE'S GETTING YOU A TIE.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.700
- A TIE?
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.933
- YEAH, AN UGLY TIE.

02:48.933 --> 02:52.867
- OH, BEAUTIFUL.

02:52.867 --> 02:54.533
THAT STINKS.

02:54.533 --> 02:57.933
OH, I'LL GET HER
SOMETHING REALLY GREAT

02:57.933 --> 03:00.100
THAT WILL MAKE HER FEEL
LIKE CRAP.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.367
- LIKE WHAT?

03:01.367 --> 03:03.367
- ANYTHING.
WHAT? IT'S AN UGLY TIE.

03:03.367 --> 03:04.933
I GOT STUFF
UNDER THE SEAT OF MY CAR

03:04.933 --> 03:06.733
THAT CAN BEAT THAT.

03:06.733 --> 03:10.733
OH, GOOD WORK, ROBERT.

03:10.733 --> 03:12.033
- YOU KNOW, I...

03:12.033 --> 03:14.400
I FEEL A LITTLE DIRTY.

03:16.433 --> 03:18.300
I LIKE IT.

03:22.267 --> 03:23.700
[children screaming]

03:23.700 --> 03:25.133
- GUYS, TAKE IT EASY!

03:25.133 --> 03:30.833
[children laughing]

03:30.833 --> 03:33.267
- COME ON, GUYS.

03:33.267 --> 03:35.867
TAKE IT EASY.

03:35.867 --> 03:41.533
HEY, LAY DOWN.
SEE IF THOSE NEW PAJAMAS WORK.

03:41.533 --> 03:43.133
- AH, LOOK.
- I LIKE IT.

03:43.133 --> 03:45.367
HOW LOVELY.
A SWEATER.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.200
- YEAH.
- WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?

03:47.200 --> 03:48.967
- OH, MACY'S.
YOU CAN RETURN IT IF YOU WANT.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.633
- NO, NO, NO.
IT'S PERFECT.

03:50.633 --> 03:52.233
SUCH A PRETTY COLOR.

03:52.233 --> 03:57.700
MACY'S IN MASSAPEQUA
OR THE CITY?

03:57.700 --> 04:03.633
- THIS ONE'S SAYS
"FOR DEBRA FROM RAH."

04:03.633 --> 04:07.200
"WRAH?"

04:07.200 --> 04:09.400
LOOKS LIKE "RAP."

04:09.400 --> 04:12.500
- YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE "RAY,"
DAD?

04:15.133 --> 04:16.767
- NO.

04:16.767 --> 04:20.067
- FRANK, PUT YOUR GLASSES ON.
YOU'RE BLIND.

04:20.067 --> 04:26.267
- AND WHAT WOULD BE THE UPSIDE
OF SEEING YOU MORE CLEARLY?

04:26.267 --> 04:29.633
- OH, LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S A CROCK-POT.

04:29.633 --> 04:32.000
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.633
- CUTE LITTLE BIRDIE TOLD ME.

04:33.633 --> 04:34.833
- OH.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.033
- BUT I THOUGHT
YOU WERE--

04:36.033 --> 04:37.567
- BAH! BAH!

04:38.833 --> 04:43.300
AND...HERE WE GO.

04:43.300 --> 04:44.967
- OH, THAT ONE IS FOR ME?

04:44.967 --> 04:46.233
- JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING ELSE

04:46.233 --> 04:48.600
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S...
SOMETHING ELSE.

04:48.600 --> 04:52.433
- OH, LOOK.
RAY, WHAT DID YOU DO?

04:52.433 --> 04:53.567
OH!

04:53.567 --> 04:56.567
OH, MY GOSH.
IT'S ALL-NEW COOKWARE.

04:56.567 --> 04:59.667
- [laughing]

04:59.667 --> 05:01.333
OH, I'M SORRY.

05:01.333 --> 05:03.967
- OH, LOOK AT THIS.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

05:03.967 --> 05:05.300
I LOVE THIS,

05:05.300 --> 05:07.867
BUT THE CROCK-POT
WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH.

05:07.867 --> 05:09.867
- NO, NO, IT WOULDN'T HAVE.

05:09.867 --> 05:13.100
- OH, THANK YOU.
I LOVE IT.

05:13.100 --> 05:17.300
- HERE'S ONE--
"FROM DEBRA, TO ENORMO."

05:18.500 --> 05:20.700
- IT DOESN'T SAY THAT, DAD.

05:20.700 --> 05:21.967
- [chuckles]

05:21.967 --> 05:26.100
YOU KNEW WHO I WAS
TALKING ABOUT, DIDN'T YOU?

05:26.100 --> 05:27.333
- WELL, THIS MUST BE
THE FERRARI

05:27.333 --> 05:30.467
I ASKED SANTA FOR.

05:30.467 --> 05:32.933
OH, UH,
THIS IS A MISTAKE, DAD.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.133
THIS ONE'S FOR RAYMOND.

05:34.133 --> 05:35.700
- NO, NO, THAT'S FOR YOU.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.067
THAT'S FOR YOU, ROBERT.

05:37.067 --> 05:38.700
WHEN YOU CAUGHT ME WITH IT
THE OTHER DAY,

05:38.700 --> 05:40.233
I HAD TO TELL YOU
IT WAS FOR RAY

05:40.233 --> 05:42.400
SO IT'D BE A SURPRISE.

05:58.767 --> 06:00.733
- WHAT?

06:00.733 --> 06:02.633
- YEAH.
- WHAT?

06:02.633 --> 06:04.967
- NO, NO, THIS IS WHAT I GOT
FOR RAY.

06:04.967 --> 06:08.200
- YOU MEAN, I'M NOT GETTING
THAT...GREAT TIE?

06:08.200 --> 06:09.933
- NO, THIS IS FOR YOU.

06:09.933 --> 06:12.000
- OH, THAT'S BIG.
THAT'S A BIG PRESENT.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.767
WOW. THAT'S NOT A TIE,

06:13.767 --> 06:17.267
UNLESS IT'S ONE OF THOSE
NOVELTY GIANT TIES, YOU KNOW?

06:17.267 --> 06:19.600
- THERE YOU GO. MERRY CHRISTMAS.
- WHOA.

06:19.600 --> 06:24.067
HEY, THAT'S HEAVY.
THAT'S HEAVIER THAN A TIE.

06:24.067 --> 06:27.333
- HEAVIER
THAN A CROCK-POT TOO.

06:27.333 --> 06:30.800
- COME ON, OPEN IT.
COME ON.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.900
- OH, MY GOD.

06:32.900 --> 06:34.767
A DVD PLAYER.

06:37.767 --> 06:41.400
- WHAT IS THAT, LIKE A HI-FI?

06:42.900 --> 06:44.333
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

06:44.333 --> 06:46.267
- SHE GOT YOU A DVD PLAYER.

06:46.267 --> 06:48.400
- YES, ISN'T THAT COOL?

06:48.400 --> 06:50.267
THIS IS THE BEST ONE
THEY MAKE.

06:50.267 --> 06:51.967
- WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?

06:51.967 --> 06:55.000
- YEAH, WHAT THE HELL?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.200
- OH, I GOT YOU
SOME MOVIES TOO.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.800
- OH, NO.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.300
- WHAT, DON'T YOU LIKE IT?

07:00.300 --> 07:01.667
- NO, I LOVE IT.
IT'S JUST--

07:01.667 --> 07:03.200
IT'S MORE THAN I EXPECTED,
YOU KNOW?

07:03.200 --> 07:06.500
I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY
WITH THE TIE.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.033
- I KNEW
YOU WOULD LIKE THIS.

07:08.033 --> 07:09.367
I LOVE MY POTS.

07:09.367 --> 07:11.467
I'M GOING TO TRY THEM OUT
RIGHT NOW.

07:11.467 --> 07:15.633
- WELL, I BETTER GO HELP HER.
THEY'RE NOT MAGIC POTS.

07:22.333 --> 07:26.300
- NICE GOING, RAYMOND.
NO GOLF.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.967
I KNOW, INSTEAD OF PLAYING
AT MYRTLE BEACH THIS SPRING,

07:28.967 --> 07:30.167
I'LL JUST HANG MYSELF

07:30.167 --> 07:33.700
WITH THE WORLD'S
TACKIEST NOOSE.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.500
- HEY, LOOK, DON'T BLAME ME,
ALL RIGHT?

07:35.500 --> 07:37.500
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME
SHE WAS GIVING ME THE TIE.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.467
YOU GAVE ME FAULTY INFORMATION.

07:39.467 --> 07:41.033
- NO, SHE FOOLED US.
SHE'S TOO GOOD.

07:41.033 --> 07:43.333
I'M NOT CUT OUT FOR THIS!

07:47.300 --> 07:48.600
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

07:48.600 --> 07:50.033
TRY TO SOFTEN HER UP
WITH A BIG PRESENT

07:50.033 --> 07:51.867
SO YOU COULD GO PLAY GOLF?

07:51.867 --> 07:53.300
- FOR YOUR INFORMATION, DAD,

07:53.300 --> 07:54.733
IT'S A LITTLE
MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

07:54.733 --> 07:57.267
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

07:57.267 --> 08:01.167
GIVE ME THAT CHOCOLATE.

08:01.167 --> 08:03.367
SIT DOWN.

08:03.367 --> 08:07.133
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING ABOUT WOMEN.

08:07.133 --> 08:08.400
YOU THINK YOU GOT TO
BUTTER THEM UP

08:08.400 --> 08:10.267
TO GET WHAT YOU WANT.

08:10.267 --> 08:12.533
THAT IS A POOR MAN'S GAME.

08:12.533 --> 08:16.833
"OH, SWEETUMS,
HERE ARE SOME FLOWERS.

08:16.833 --> 08:20.567
CAN I GO TO THE LODGE?"

08:20.567 --> 08:21.900
NOT FOR ME.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.967
NOT FOR ME!

08:24.967 --> 08:29.300
I DON'T DO THAT "NICE" CRAP.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.367
- SO HOW DO YOU GET
WHAT YOU WANT?

08:33.367 --> 08:38.100
- I'VE LEARNED TO DO WITHOUT.

08:42.433 --> 08:44.633
- LOOK, THIS WOULD HAVE WORKED

08:44.633 --> 08:46.600
IF I'D GOTTEN
THAT STUPID TIE.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.600
- OH, YOU WANT THE TIE?
I'LL TAKE THE DVD THING.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.267
- PUT THAT DOWN.
YOU'RE NOT TAKING THAT.

08:50.267 --> 08:53.300
- HEY!
YOU DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?

08:53.300 --> 08:55.433
IT'S STARING YOU
RIGHT IN THE FACE.

08:55.433 --> 08:56.633
- WHAT?

08:56.633 --> 08:58.033
- YOU'RE SO WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR OFFENSE,

08:58.033 --> 09:00.333
YOU DIDN'T PLAY DEFENSE.

09:00.333 --> 09:01.567
THE QUESTION ISN'T

09:01.567 --> 09:03.733
"WHY DIDN'T SHE GIVE ME
THAT TIE?"

09:03.733 --> 09:04.933
THE QUESTION IS

09:04.933 --> 09:08.767
"WHY DID SHE GIVE ME
THAT DVD THING?"

09:08.767 --> 09:11.200
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:11.200 --> 09:13.033
I'M HER HUSBAND.
SHE'S MY WIFE.

09:13.033 --> 09:16.100
DON'T I DESERVE A GREAT...

09:23.767 --> 09:26.033
- AMATEURS.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.767
- WAIT A MINUTE.

09:29.767 --> 09:32.800
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
DEBRA GOT RAY A DVD PLAYER

09:32.800 --> 09:34.933
BECAUSE SHE WANTS SOMETHING
FROM HIM?

09:34.933 --> 09:38.933
- OF COURSE.
WHERE YOU BEEN?

09:38.933 --> 09:40.300
- WAIT.
BUT THAT'S SO WEASELY.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.700
THAT'S NOT HER.
THAT'S--

09:41.700 --> 09:45.600
- YOU.
- YES.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.633
- OKAY, WHO WANTS
A LITTLE HOT CHOCOLATE?

09:48.633 --> 09:50.133
I HEATED UP THE MILK

09:50.133 --> 09:52.933
IN MY NEW 2-QUART SAUCEPAN.

09:52.933 --> 09:55.700
HERE YOU GO.
HERE YOU GO.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.833
THANKS AGAIN
FOR THESE POTS, RAY.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.033
I REALLY LOVE THEM.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.667
- HMM.

10:04.533 --> 10:09.067
OH, I GOT ME
A BLACK MAGIC WOMAN.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.833
- THANKS FOR THE GOLF,
RAYMOND.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.533
- WILL YOU SHUT UP
ABOUT THE STUPID GOLF?

10:20.533 --> 10:22.133
THERE'S BIGGER THINGS HERE.

10:22.133 --> 10:24.400
- YEAH, LIKE WHAT?

10:24.400 --> 10:26.167
WHAT'S SHE SUCKING UP
TO ME FOR?

10:26.167 --> 10:27.467
- MAYBE SHE WANTS TO SLEEP

10:27.467 --> 10:32.433
WITH THE BAGBOY
FROM THE A&P.

10:32.433 --> 10:35.133
- YEAH, I'M SERIOUS, DAD.

10:35.133 --> 10:37.967
- HAVE YOU SEEN THE BAGBOY?

10:37.967 --> 10:39.267
- WILL YOU STOP?

10:39.267 --> 10:42.533
- HEY, DON'T SHOOT
THE MESSENGER.

10:42.533 --> 10:44.500
- COME ON, COME ON.
I GOT TO THINK.

10:44.500 --> 10:48.633
WHAT DOES SHE WANT?
WHAT DO WOMEN WANT?

10:55.900 --> 10:58.533
- I THINK IT'S THE BAGBOY.

11:00.633 --> 11:02.867
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
FIND OUT WHAT'S UP.

11:02.867 --> 11:06.967
- I THINK HIS NAME IS LARRY.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.400
- HEY, DEB.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.133
- RAYMOND, I'M MAKING BROWNIES
FOR LATER.

11:10.133 --> 11:11.600
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO LICK THE BEATER?

11:11.600 --> 11:13.933
- NO, NO, MOM.

11:13.933 --> 11:16.100
OKAY, YEAH, OKAY.

11:19.133 --> 11:21.333
LISTEN, DEB,
I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

11:21.333 --> 11:24.800

HONEY.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.200
MMM, CHOCOLATE.

11:28.633 --> 11:30.333

WHAT'S WITH YOU TODAY?

11:30.333 --> 11:31.833
- NOTHING. IT'S CHRISTMAS.

11:31.833 --> 11:33.200
THE KIDS ARE HAVING FUN.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.767
I'M HAVING A NICE TIME
WITH YOUR MOM.

11:34.767 --> 11:36.500
I'M JUST HAPPY.

11:44.433 --> 11:46.433
SO WHAT DID YOU WANT, RAY?

11:46.433 --> 11:49.500

OKAY, YEAH.

OF GOING TO MYRTLE BEACH

12:04.800 --> 12:07.067
FOR A WEEKEND FOR GOLF,
AND, UH,

12:07.067 --> 12:08.867
I WAS THINKING
I WANT TO GO WITH THEM.

12:08.867 --> 12:11.200
YEAH.
HOW DOES THAT GRAB YOU?

12:11.200 --> 12:12.533
- FOR A WHOLE WEEKEND?

12:12.533 --> 12:14.333
- YEAH, A WHOLE WEEK--
A MATTER OF FACT,

12:14.333 --> 12:16.067
I THINK
IT'S A THREE-DAY WEEKEND.

12:16.067 --> 12:17.400
SO YEAH,
I FEEL LIKE GOING.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.800
I THINK I'M GOING TO GO.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.400
ALL RIGHT?

12:20.400 --> 12:23.033
- WELL, THAT'S THREE DAYS
WITH JUST ME AND THE KIDS.

12:23.033 --> 12:24.633
- YEP.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.167
- YOU SHOULD GO.

12:33.167 --> 12:37.433
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:49.467 --> 12:52.100
- WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU?

12:52.100 --> 12:54.633
GIVE ME THAT.

13:01.133 --> 13:05.533
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

13:05.533 --> 13:06.933
- I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON

13:06.933 --> 13:08.300
WITH THE KISSING
AND THE MARSHMALLOWS

13:08.300 --> 13:09.533
AND THE LETTING ME PLAY GOLF

13:09.533 --> 13:12.133
AND THE BIG
EXPENSIVE DVD PLAYER.

13:12.133 --> 13:14.033
- IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?

13:14.033 --> 13:16.000
YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT HOW MUCH IT COST?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.633
- YES. WHAT IS THE COST...

13:18.633 --> 13:21.100
TO ME?

13:21.100 --> 13:22.933
- WHAT IS A DVD PLAYER?

13:22.933 --> 13:24.833
- COME ON.
NOT NOW, MOM. PLEASE.

13:24.833 --> 13:28.067
- IS IT FOR PORNOGRAPHY?

13:33.967 --> 13:35.200
- YES, MARIE,

13:35.200 --> 13:38.600
I GOT RAY A PORN MACHINE
FOR CHRISTMAS.

13:41.367 --> 13:45.567
- I DON'T LIKE THAT, DEBRA.

13:45.567 --> 13:48.400
- LOOK, DON'T--DON'T CHANGE
THE SUBJECT HERE.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.033
I DON'T LIKE BEING PLAYED.

13:50.033 --> 13:51.800
- YOU THINK I GOT YOU
THAT DVD THING

13:51.800 --> 13:53.733
BECAUSE I WANT SOMETHING?

13:53.733 --> 13:55.500
- NO, BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.667
COME ON, HUH?

13:56.667 --> 13:58.767
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:01.267 --> 14:04.367
- WE'RE WAITING.

14:08.767 --> 14:10.600
- I DON'T WANT ANYTHING.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.333
I WAS TRYING
TO GET YOU SOMETHING

14:12.333 --> 14:14.333
I THOUGHT
MIGHT MAKE YOU HAPPY,

14:14.333 --> 14:17.267
BECAUSE AS A MATTER OF FACT,

14:17.267 --> 14:21.167
I DO LOVE YOU
AND IT'S CHRISTMAS

14:21.167 --> 14:25.600
AND I WANTED TO GET YOU
A DVD PLAYER.

14:31.933 --> 14:35.833
- OH, UH, WELL...

14:35.833 --> 14:40.033
THANKS THEN.

14:40.033 --> 14:42.133
I'M GOING TO GO SET IT UP.

14:42.133 --> 14:45.400
- WAIT, JUST--JUST A MINUTE.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.600
DID YOU GET ME THOSE POTS

14:46.600 --> 14:48.300
SO I WOULD LET YOU
PLAY GOLF?

14:48.300 --> 14:51.667
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
COME ON.

14:51.667 --> 14:53.867
WHAT?
WHERE'S THIS COMING FROM?

14:53.867 --> 14:57.000
- UNBELIEVABLE.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.400
- OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE,
RAYMOND.

15:05.700 --> 15:06.833
- YOU TRIED TO BRIBE ME.

15:06.833 --> 15:08.533
- NO, IT'S NOT BRIBING.
IT'S JUST--

15:08.533 --> 15:10.067
IT'S GETTING YOU
SOMETHING NICE

15:10.067 --> 15:12.667
SO YOU WOULD GIVE ME
SOMETHING NICE, HUH?

15:12.667 --> 15:14.067
I GOT YOU
THIS ENGAGEMENT RING

15:14.067 --> 15:15.267
SO YOU WOULD MARRY ME.

15:15.267 --> 15:18.133
- YEAH, I FELL
FOR THAT ONE TOO.

15:18.133 --> 15:20.333
- WE SHOULD KEEP
OUR VOICES DOWN.

15:20.333 --> 15:23.300
- YOU KNOW, MARIE,
WOULD YOU MIND?

15:23.300 --> 15:24.600
- BUT I'M BAKING.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.200
- I'M TRYING TO TALK
TO MY HUSBAND.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.433
- FINE, DEBRA.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.400
- YEAH, SO WHAT, RAY?

15:40.400 --> 15:42.000
IS THIS WHAT YOU ALWAYS DO?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.300
HAVE YOU EVER GOTTEN ME
A PRESENT

15:43.300 --> 15:45.200
WITHOUT EXPECTING SOMETHING
IN RETURN?

15:45.200 --> 15:46.967
- YES, YES, PLENTY OF TIMES.
- YEAH, YEAH.

15:46.967 --> 15:48.733
IT'S JUST LIKE THE KISSING.

15:48.733 --> 15:50.133
YOU ONLY KISS ME 'CAUSE YOU
THINK IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO SEX.

15:50.133 --> 15:51.800
- OH, BABY,
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.133
- OH.

15:53.133 --> 15:54.633
YOU KNOW, THE WORST PART

15:54.633 --> 15:56.333
ISN'T THAT
YOU'RE A MANIPULATIVE JERK.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.267
IT'S THAT
YOU THINK I'M LIKE YOU.

15:58.267 --> 16:00.967
- NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE MANIPULATIVE.

16:00.967 --> 16:02.467
I THINK YOU'RE PRETTY.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.500
COME ON!

16:19.000 --> 16:22.267
THOSE COULD HAVE HAD
WALNUTS IN THEM.

16:24.633 --> 16:27.233
LOOK, UH, IF IT'S GOING
TO BE A PROBLEM,

16:27.233 --> 16:28.433
I DON'T HAVE TO GOLF,
ALL RIGHT?

16:28.433 --> 16:29.833
- IS THAT ALL
YOU CARE ABOUT?

16:29.833 --> 16:31.533
- NO, THAT'S JUST IT.
I DON'T CARE.

16:31.533 --> 16:34.033
I DON'T CARE, ALL RIGHT?
I DON'T CARE AT ALL.

16:34.033 --> 16:37.800
IT'S JUST--IT'S JUST...

16:37.800 --> 16:40.433
ROBERT MIGHT HANG HIMSELF.

16:45.967 --> 16:47.900
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
OH, I DON'T CARE.

16:47.900 --> 16:51.233
I SAID YOU COULD PLAY GOLF,
JUST GO PLAY GOLF.

16:54.333 --> 16:57.533
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
THANK YOU.

16:57.533 --> 16:59.133
- WHATEVER.

16:59.133 --> 17:00.600
- LISTEN...

17:00.600 --> 17:03.867
IF THERE'S SOMETHING FUN
THAT YOU WANT TO DO,

17:03.867 --> 17:05.067
THEN YOU SHOULD DO IT.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.367
- YEP, ALL RIGHT.

17:06.367 --> 17:08.633
- NO. COME ON, YOU DESERVE
TO HAVE FUN TOO.

17:08.633 --> 17:10.500
- YEAH, OKAY.

17:10.500 --> 17:14.500
WHEN THE KIDS GO TO COLLEGE,
I'LL SEE A MOVIE.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.733
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.267
YOU WANT TO GO TO THE MOVIES?
GO.

17:17.267 --> 17:19.300
GO TO THE MOVIES.
GO TODAY IF YOU WANT.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.133
- YEAH, I'M GOING TO GO

17:21.133 --> 17:24.167
- JEWISH PEOPLE DO.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.867
ALL RIGHT, THEN YOU GO.
GO THIS WEEKEND.

17:27.867 --> 17:29.433
- YEAH, LIKE THAT'LL HAPPEN.

17:29.433 --> 17:32.033
- I'M SAYING IT'LL HAPPEN.
GO TO THE MOVIES.

17:32.033 --> 17:33.400
COME ON.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.667
I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

17:34.667 --> 17:37.233
COME ON,
IT'LL MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

17:37.233 --> 17:38.500
I DON'T WANT TO GET

17:38.500 --> 17:42.633
A DVD PLAYER AND GOLF
AND NICENESS

17:42.633 --> 17:46.900
AND YOU GET...POTS.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.833
COME ON.
GO TO THE MOVIES.

17:48.833 --> 17:50.167
- THANKS ANYWAY, HONEY.

17:50.167 --> 17:51.367
- COME ON, IT'S LIKE YOU
DON'T EVEN WANT

17:51.367 --> 17:52.767
TO GO TO THE MOVIES.

17:52.767 --> 17:55.967
- IT'S OKAY.

17:55.967 --> 17:58.133
- WAIT A MINUTE.

17:58.133 --> 18:03.867
YOU WANT TO NOT
GO TO THE MOVIES.

18:03.867 --> 18:05.133
- WHAT?

18:05.133 --> 18:06.400
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.133
BECAUSE THEN IF YOU GO
TO THE MOVIES,

18:08.133 --> 18:09.333
YOU DON'T GET TO SAY,

18:09.333 --> 18:11.133
"I NEVER GET TO GO
TO THE MOVIES."

18:11.133 --> 18:12.800
- WHEN DO I SAY THAT?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.000
- YOU SAY THAT ALL THE TIME.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.200
"I NEVER GET TO DO ANYTHING."

18:15.200 --> 18:16.767
AND YOU LOVE THAT.

18:16.767 --> 18:19.433
YOU'RE LIKE ONE OF THOSE
WHATEVER YOU CALL THEM.

18:19.433 --> 18:21.133
- A MARTYR?
- YES.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.567
- I'M NOT A MARTYR.

18:22.567 --> 18:25.400
- THEN HOW COME I DON'T
HELP OUT AROUND HERE?

18:32.200 --> 18:34.600
- HOW COME YOU DON'T
HELP OUT AROUND HERE?

18:34.600 --> 18:36.633
- BECAUSE YOU
DON'T WANT ME TO!

18:36.633 --> 18:38.400
'CAUSE--
'CAUSE YOU WANT TO DO IT ALL

18:38.400 --> 18:42.000
BECAUSE THEN YOU
CAN FEEL SUPERIOR.

18:43.867 --> 18:45.600
- YOU, UH...

18:45.600 --> 18:50.000
- YOU STAMMER BECAUSE YOU KNOW
I SPEAK TRUTH.

18:52.167 --> 18:53.667
- DO YOU KNOW
HOW CLOSE YOU ARE

18:53.667 --> 18:56.233
TO THE END OF YOUR LIFE?

18:56.233 --> 18:57.933
- I'M NOT SCARED.

18:57.933 --> 19:00.800
I'M NOT SCARED BECAUSE I'M
ONTO SOMETHING HERE, HMM?

19:00.800 --> 19:03.833
LIKE THE DVD PLAYER.
WHY?

19:03.833 --> 19:06.633
WHY?

19:06.633 --> 19:10.400
WHY, AFTER--AFTER YEARS OF--
OF COMPLAINING

19:10.400 --> 19:13.700
THAT ALL I DO IS LAY AROUND
AND WATCH TELEVISION

19:13.700 --> 19:16.867
WOULD YOU BUY ME A DEVICE

19:16.867 --> 19:20.233
THAT IS DESIGNED TO MAKE

19:20.233 --> 19:26.367
THE TELEVISION-WATCHING
EXPERIENCE EVEN BETTER?

19:29.367 --> 19:34.667
WE MUST ASK OURSELVES...

19:34.667 --> 19:36.767
WHY?

19:49.133 --> 19:50.800
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:50.800 --> 19:55.400
WHY THE HELL WOULD I BUY YOU
A DVD PLAYER?

19:55.400 --> 19:57.800
- YOU HAVE PROBLEMS.
- I DO.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.000
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

19:59.000 --> 20:02.067
- I DO NOT KNOW.

20:02.067 --> 20:03.400
- I SHOULD MAKE YOU

20:03.400 --> 20:05.567
HELP ME OUT MORE
AROUND HERE.

20:05.567 --> 20:08.800
- WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO. I MEAN--

20:08.800 --> 20:11.467
- NO, REALLY. YOU KNOW,
I JUST--I WORK TOO HARD.

20:11.467 --> 20:12.967
I DON'T NEED
TO BE A MARTYR.

20:12.967 --> 20:18.567
- I DON'T THINK YOU WANT
TO GIVE IT UP COLD TURKEY.

20:18.567 --> 20:21.467
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE BEEN UP SINCE 5:00.

20:21.467 --> 20:23.200
I'M GOING TO GO
TAKE A NAP.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.167
- OKAY, BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE CHRISTMAS DINNER?

20:26.167 --> 20:28.200
- YOUR MOM CAN MAKE IT.
SHE WANTS TO ANYWAY.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.400
LISTEN, WOULD YOU MIND

20:29.400 --> 20:31.033
STRAIGHTENING UP
THE LIVING ROOM?

20:31.033 --> 20:32.533
AND THEN MAKE SURE THE KIDS
GET WASHED AND DRESSED, OKAY?

20:32.533 --> 20:34.067
THANKS, THAT'D HELP ME OUT
A LOT.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.267
- OKAY, LOOK,
I'LL DO THOSE THINGS,

20:35.267 --> 20:36.467
BUT THEN I GET TO GOLF, RIGHT?

20:36.467 --> 20:39.733
- UH, NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

20:39.733 --> 20:41.067
I MEAN, LOOK.

20:41.067 --> 20:42.500
HOW COULD I NOT THINK OF MYSELF
AS A MARTYR

20:42.500 --> 20:43.867
IF I'M STUCK AT HOME
WITH THE KIDS BY MYSELF

20:43.867 --> 20:45.633
WHILE YOU'RE OUT GOLFING
WITH YOUR BUDDIES?

20:45.633 --> 20:50.433
- YOU KNOW, ABOUT MARTYRS,
A LOT OF THEM BECAME SAINTS.

20:50.433 --> 20:51.833
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:51.833 --> 20:54.900
AND THANK YOU
BECAUSE YOU REALLY HELPED ME.

20:54.900 --> 20:58.400
THIS IS A GREAT CHRISTMAS.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.733
- BUT...

20:59.733 --> 21:01.833
LOOK, OH...

21:01.833 --> 21:06.400
THAT'S NOT REALLY
WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.733
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?

21:08.733 --> 21:11.167
- DUSTING.

21:19.533 --> 21:21.100
- MARIE, COME ON.
COME HERE.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.500
- WHAT?

21:22.500 --> 21:25.567
WHAT IS IT?

21:25.567 --> 21:27.433
- HERE.

21:27.433 --> 21:28.900
- FOR ME?

21:28.900 --> 21:31.300
- YEAH.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

21:31.300 --> 21:35.333
- FRANK, YOU ALREADY
GAVE ME LOTTERY TICKETS.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.900
- THOSE WERE A BUST.

21:39.900 --> 21:41.933
JUST OPEN IT.

21:41.933 --> 21:43.200
- [gasps]

21:43.200 --> 21:46.433
OH, FRANK, EARRINGS.

21:46.433 --> 21:48.267
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.
