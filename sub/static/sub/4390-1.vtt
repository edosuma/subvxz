03:05.779 --> 03:07.157
Your father?

03:11.751 --> 03:13.740
Dead?

03:15.518 --> 03:17.715
What's your name?

03:18.722 --> 03:21.198
I don't want it anymore.

03:21.353 --> 03:23.923
I'll give you a new one.

03:24.911 --> 03:28.413
Leo. Like a lion.

04:04.568 --> 04:06.914
Vasili, fire your weapon!

04:07.068 --> 04:08.436
Shit.

04:08.753 --> 04:12.164
Fall back! Vasili, get down!

04:12.612 --> 04:16.021
Get down! Shoot back!

04:23.289 --> 04:25.148
Alexei, cover me!

04:45.276 --> 04:48.377
Vasili, fire your weapon!

05:09.536 --> 05:12.234
Vasili! Hey, Vasili!

05:13.225 --> 05:18.144
You can come up the stairs now. It's safe.
Don't be coward. No one will shoot you.

05:18.299 --> 05:21.283
Alexei, just leave him alone.

05:25.830 --> 05:28.040
- Give him the flag.
- Me?

05:28.194 --> 05:30.477
You. You, too. Come with me.

05:30.631 --> 05:33.003
- Me?
- Yeah.

05:33.906 --> 05:36.617
Leo, make us proud.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.247
I will, sir.

05:39.029 --> 05:43.539
Okay. Get up there. On the spire.

05:44.337 --> 05:49.218
Now let's show the people
how Berlin has fallen to the Red Army.

05:49.729 --> 05:52.709
- Lose the goddamn watches.
- What?

05:52.864 --> 05:56.534
Take them off. Stolen watches.
They can't be seen.

05:56.688 --> 05:58.801
- Hey, Leo!
- What?

05:58.955 --> 06:01.574
The Admiral, he don't like my watches.
You take this.

06:01.729 --> 06:05.375
- He doesn't like watches?
- No. He doesn't like German watches.

06:05.529 --> 06:09.928
- Grab the flag and get up there.
- Yeah, come up here. You take the flag.

06:12.336 --> 06:15.627
- Okay, wait, wait.
- Take the flag.

06:15.781 --> 06:18.455
Catch a big wind,
so we can see our flag.

06:18.609 --> 06:20.200
- Good, that's right.
- Like this?

06:20.355 --> 06:22.477
Yeah, great.

06:23.715 --> 06:24.704
One more.

06:24.858 --> 06:26.095
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

07:25.093 --> 07:26.606
Do you remember when we first met?

07:26.865 --> 07:30.203
Raisa, remember when we first met?
You thought that I was rude.

07:30.357 --> 07:31.645
- You were rude.
- I was not rude.

07:31.799 --> 07:34.748
- You were staring at me.
- I was...

07:35.006 --> 07:38.821
I was mesmerized.
I was mesmerized by your beauty.

07:38.975 --> 07:42.490
Even had to get off at the wrong
Metro station just to ask you your name.

07:42.644 --> 07:44.618
- I lied.
- She did.

07:44.772 --> 07:47.359
She told me her name was Lena.

07:47.514 --> 07:51.434
- Yes. I didn't know you then.
- So you still lied.

07:52.381 --> 07:55.402
I turn up at the park
to see my beautiful Lena.

07:56.390 --> 07:58.591
- No Lena.
- It was raining.

07:59.163 --> 08:02.436
- It was raining for a week.
- It was raining.

08:04.971 --> 08:08.837
Questionable.
But then I found you somehow.

08:08.991 --> 08:13.024
8:15 a.m. Same train platform
that I met you before.

08:13.178 --> 08:17.287
Then I asked you... well, I convinced you
to walk with me that day.

08:17.441 --> 08:19.485
And when we got to the school gate,

08:19.639 --> 08:24.055
I held your hands, and I looked
into your eyes, and I said to you,

08:27.280 --> 08:30.999
"Lena... Lena, Lena, Lena, Lena,

08:31.153 --> 08:33.772
"Lena, Lena, Lena,

08:33.927 --> 08:38.388
"I am so ready to kiss you right now."

08:39.395 --> 08:41.366
And do you know what Lena told me?

08:42.937 --> 08:46.578
"Comrade Demidov, my name is Raisa."

08:48.192 --> 08:51.673
Who's Raisa? So now I have
to go back to work,

08:51.827 --> 08:53.932
and tell all my friends
that I'm in love with Raisa.

08:54.086 --> 08:56.954
This beautiful Raisa.
My friends, they all laugh at me.

08:57.108 --> 08:59.940
You were the worst, I remember.
Laughed at me because they say,

09:00.094 --> 09:02.704
"Last week, we in love with Lena,
this week, it's Raisa..."

09:02.859 --> 09:05.980
Next week, maybe Natasha. Who knows?

09:06.134 --> 09:07.677
With Leo it's always someone new.

09:07.831 --> 09:11.657
No, there will never be somebody new.
There will only be you.

09:11.811 --> 09:14.343
All those stories are over for me now.

09:15.444 --> 09:17.723
There is only you.

09:19.148 --> 09:22.132
There will always only be you.

09:23.095 --> 09:24.979
Always you.

10:26.460 --> 10:30.573
This is the veterinarian's place.
Stinking zoo for a stinking traitor.

10:30.727 --> 10:32.580
Is he gone?

10:32.943 --> 10:37.581
- You can't say I didn't tell you, boss.
- Collect the evidence for me, please.

10:45.048 --> 10:48.427
And you have no idea whatsoever

10:48.581 --> 10:50.974
where Anatoly Brodsky might be?

10:56.068 --> 10:57.115
None.

11:00.457 --> 11:03.681
All I can tell you, he was...

11:04.043 --> 11:05.849
Was?

11:06.004 --> 11:07.888
- Is.
- Is?

11:09.076 --> 11:11.027
He is a good neighbor.

11:18.247 --> 11:21.681
I respect and admire you trying
to protect him, but...

11:21.835 --> 11:25.283
you see, for me it's different,
because we are here

11:25.438 --> 11:29.622
in your home because
your friend, companion,

11:30.299 --> 11:33.821
he is a traitor, Zina.

11:33.975 --> 11:37.302
You understand?
And traitors have friends.

11:37.456 --> 11:41.056
And these "friends,"

11:41.210 --> 11:43.875
they are not our friends.

11:50.254 --> 11:53.025
Do I have to spell this out for you?

11:54.326 --> 11:55.939
Zina,

11:56.093 --> 11:58.030
now is the time to say...

11:59.383 --> 12:01.476
something.

12:04.444 --> 12:06.525
Anything.

12:30.591 --> 12:33.526
Mama! Mama!

12:35.810 --> 12:38.007
No shooting.

12:41.077 --> 12:43.264
- Mama.
- Don't move.

12:48.002 --> 12:50.107
- Semyon Okun?
- Yes.

12:53.152 --> 12:55.791
There is no one else in here.

12:57.687 --> 12:59.902
Anatoly Brodsky, do you know him?

13:00.056 --> 13:03.614
- Yes, I know Brodsky.
- Right. Do you know where he is?

13:03.768 --> 13:07.144
- Brodsky? In Moscow, I think.
- No, he's not in Moscow.

13:07.298 --> 13:11.261
But we have information that tells us
that he's staying here with you.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.846
- No.
- Oh, it's...

13:15.806 --> 13:18.571
Wait, you said something.

13:19.624 --> 13:21.634
Yes, you did. You did.
You said something.

13:21.788 --> 13:24.825
- No.
- What did you say?

13:39.668 --> 13:41.628
Yuri, Nikolai, spread out!

13:53.557 --> 13:54.762
Brodsky!

14:01.900 --> 14:04.202
Brodsky!

14:16.741 --> 14:21.022
Don't fuck with me.
Put your hands where I can see them.

14:23.287 --> 14:26.452
- Come on. Get it over with.
- Put your hands on your head.

14:27.128 --> 14:29.034
- Don't be stupid.
- Shoot me.

14:29.188 --> 14:32.466
- Put your hands on your head.
- Come on, shoot me!

14:33.603 --> 14:36.161
Kill me! Kill me!

14:37.403 --> 14:39.495
Come on, kill me!

14:46.146 --> 14:48.380
Alexei!

14:58.563 --> 15:00.656
Kill me!

15:10.086 --> 15:12.234
Alexei! Alexei!

15:21.590 --> 15:23.917
I got this.

15:35.793 --> 15:38.599
He's fucking crazy.

15:39.747 --> 15:42.075
Please, I ask you.
I beg you. Don't do this.

15:42.229 --> 15:44.303
Please, don't kill my family,
my children.

15:44.457 --> 15:48.123
These are the future of Russia.
Please! No, please, I beg you!

15:48.278 --> 15:49.558
What is he doing?

15:50.216 --> 15:52.122
Please, no, don't hurt her.
I ask you, please!

15:52.276 --> 15:55.566
- No! No!
- Please! I ask you, please!

15:57.365 --> 15:59.255
No!

16:00.897 --> 16:02.922
Vasili!

16:04.199 --> 16:06.839
Hey! Vasili!

16:07.424 --> 16:09.960
What the fuck are you doing?

16:11.802 --> 16:14.513
Making... making an example.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.586
- You're doing what?
- Making example.

16:18.740 --> 16:21.781
- Making example of what?
- These people are traitors.

16:21.935 --> 16:24.197
Maybe now they can grow up
and learn a lesson from all this.

16:24.351 --> 16:27.473
- What did you fucking say?
- They can learn a lesson from this.

16:30.016 --> 16:33.139
Learn something from you, little shit?

16:33.294 --> 16:35.671
What are they gonna
fucking learn from you?

16:35.825 --> 16:40.014
You fucking coward!
Children! Fucking children!

16:40.168 --> 16:43.325
- What's your fucking answer?
- Leo.

16:47.042 --> 16:49.304
I want men!

16:49.459 --> 16:51.574
Leo.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.759
Shit.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.669
Get him out of here, because I will
fucking kill him. Do you understand me?

16:58.823 --> 17:00.204
Move him now.

17:00.358 --> 17:03.582
Get these children out of here.
What is wrong with you people?

17:03.736 --> 17:05.876
Alexei!

17:06.030 --> 17:08.122
Alexei!

17:09.755 --> 17:11.836
Take care of this.

17:37.399 --> 17:40.157
Do you have any relatives
that live nearby?

19:17.009 --> 19:20.127
Have you tried that with a kopeck?

19:22.481 --> 19:25.269
It's best with a kopeck.

19:25.423 --> 19:28.465
Let me show you, okay? Not here.

19:28.619 --> 19:32.052
Little further down the line
would be better.

19:34.838 --> 19:36.820
- What's your name?
- Jora.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.557
You can save yourself...

20:18.077 --> 20:20.558
a lot of pain...

20:20.713 --> 20:24.446
and unnecessary suffering
if you talk to me.

20:25.631 --> 20:27.586
Yes.

20:29.699 --> 20:32.646
Who are you working for?

20:33.028 --> 20:35.028
Anna...

20:35.599 --> 20:38.316
Ivanovna Akmatova.

20:38.470 --> 20:41.673
She has a dog, which will not eat.

20:42.343 --> 20:45.386
Mattias Borisky Rakowski.

20:45.541 --> 20:48.430
His terrier is going blind.

20:49.682 --> 20:53.973
I'm a veterinarian. I'm nothing more.

20:55.982 --> 20:59.080
If you are so innocent...

20:59.899 --> 21:02.922
why do you run?

21:04.500 --> 21:07.399
That is a very good question.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.963
I run because you were following me.

21:13.409 --> 21:17.424
When you are followed, you are arrested.
And when you are arrested...

21:17.578 --> 21:20.544
you are already guilty.

21:23.910 --> 21:26.039
So you tell me.

21:26.663 --> 21:29.308
Why did I run?

21:30.629 --> 21:33.154
Do you have any idea...

21:34.161 --> 21:36.462
what happens...

21:37.303 --> 21:42.075
in this room next door here,
to a man like you,

21:42.230 --> 21:44.879
when you don't talk?

21:45.612 --> 21:48.968
A child knows what will happen to me.

21:52.281 --> 21:55.269
- Should he cross?
- No!

21:55.423 --> 21:59.878
- What should he do?
- Look both ways!

22:00.033 --> 22:02.202
Yes. Good.

22:02.356 --> 22:06.567
Because our leader loves his children,
want them all to be safe.

22:07.633 --> 22:10.449
This is sodium thiopental.

22:10.604 --> 22:13.386
In less than a minute,
he will only be able to speak the truth.

22:15.406 --> 22:17.539
Okay.

22:19.650 --> 22:22.232
Little bit more.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.069
Wait. Wait.

22:36.393 --> 22:39.678
Vasili, ask your questions.

22:39.957 --> 22:43.462
Okay. I want the name of every person
passing you information

22:43.616 --> 22:45.242
from the British Embassy.

22:53.028 --> 22:54.407
Leo.

22:55.456 --> 22:57.371
Leo.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.138
- What is it?
- Someone at the door.

23:00.292 --> 23:01.861
Where?

23:10.712 --> 23:13.492
Major Kuzmin?

23:13.873 --> 23:15.602
I came as fast as I could.

23:18.104 --> 23:20.519
There's been a terrible accident.

23:22.041 --> 23:24.957
Alexei's son has been hit by a train.

23:25.849 --> 23:28.716
I thought you wanted
to hear it from me first.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.060
A train?

23:34.963 --> 23:37.204
You and Alexei Andreyevich

23:37.462 --> 23:40.181
came through the war together,
didn't you?

23:40.335 --> 23:41.423
Yes.

23:42.739 --> 23:46.976
We value Alexei. And we do everything
we can to protect him.

23:48.123 --> 23:51.819
I'm sorry, I don't follow you. You...

23:52.911 --> 23:54.158
protect him?

23:54.313 --> 23:59.110
The poor man must be beside himself.
He's claiming his son was murdered.

23:59.861 --> 24:04.476
Stalin tells us that murder
is strictly a capitalist disease.

24:05.686 --> 24:09.731
But Alexei is flirting with treason.
So you know what has to be done.

24:15.993 --> 24:17.879
I will find someone
on the third floor to deal...

24:18.033 --> 24:21.146
And who better to do it than you?

24:28.665 --> 24:30.653
Done.

24:31.326 --> 24:34.871
Your brother. Help him help himself.

24:39.603 --> 24:42.266
- Alexei.
- Leo.

24:45.917 --> 24:48.000
Come in.

24:50.221 --> 24:51.728
I am so sorry.

24:51.883 --> 24:54.040
I have been personally...

24:54.194 --> 24:59.207
asked to share
the official report with you.

25:00.091 --> 25:03.875
"Yesterday morning,
25th of October at 10:35,

25:04.029 --> 25:07.162
"the body of one Jora Andreyev,

25:07.316 --> 25:08.608
"8 years old,

25:08.762 --> 25:13.302
"was found close by the train tracks
at 1 kilometer east of Vialki.

25:14.186 --> 25:17.355
"He was found fully clothed.

25:19.222 --> 25:22.700
"Further examination of the victim's
body and the witness..."

25:22.854 --> 25:27.058
My boy was found naked.

25:27.420 --> 25:31.406
No. He was found fully clothed.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.945
"Further examination..."

25:33.099 --> 25:36.143
A train doesn't undress a boy.

25:38.138 --> 25:40.486
"Further examination
of the victim's body

25:40.640 --> 25:44.838
"and witness testimony
show multiple contusions,

25:44.992 --> 25:48.891
"with bruisings and lacerations
to the torso.

25:49.045 --> 25:52.159
"In keeping with this testimony,
we believe the cause of death

25:52.313 --> 25:55.550
"was indeed a tragic accident."

25:55.704 --> 25:59.208
Why would a report even bother
to mention that he was clothed?

25:59.519 --> 26:01.397
This was signed by Major Kuzmin.

26:01.551 --> 26:04.222
He is the Department of Interior
Crimes Against the State.

26:04.376 --> 26:06.745
5th Main Directorate, MGB.

26:06.899 --> 26:11.866
Someone has slaughtered my son!
Your godson, Leo! And you do nothing?

26:13.916 --> 26:15.558
I am sorry.

26:15.712 --> 26:18.804
- Read the report.
- To find out what?

26:18.958 --> 26:21.206
Someone has slaughtered your son.

26:21.361 --> 26:23.325
- Do something!
- Nina!

26:23.480 --> 26:26.897
Someone has slaughtered your son!
Someone has slaughtered your son!

26:27.051 --> 26:30.688
Someone has slaughtered your son!

26:39.876 --> 26:41.654
This is crazy.

26:41.808 --> 26:44.894
You cannot do this.
I have men downstairs!

26:45.048 --> 26:49.128
They can hear everything. There is a reason
why they sent me. You understand?

26:51.430 --> 26:54.153
You have to be quiet.

26:59.791 --> 27:02.725
They wouldn't let me see him, Leo.

27:02.961 --> 27:06.711
- They wouldn't let me see my boy.
- Alexei, please, will you just...

27:06.866 --> 27:08.476
- No, you tell me.
- ...read the file?

27:08.630 --> 27:09.931
Tell me.

27:11.259 --> 27:13.486
What should I tell her? My wife?

27:13.640 --> 27:16.588
You tell her
whatever it takes to protect

27:16.846 --> 27:20.438
every single body in that room.

27:20.592 --> 27:23.967
Everybody in there, who you love,

27:24.121 --> 27:28.376
you tell them whatever it takes.
Do you understand?

27:29.127 --> 27:33.486
And you let him go.

27:35.627 --> 27:40.374
Alexei, there can be
no murder in paradise.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.616
Remember?

27:52.253 --> 27:54.892
There's a witness, Leo.

27:55.782 --> 27:57.916
Excuse me?

28:00.901 --> 28:03.033
A woman.

28:06.629 --> 28:09.505
What do you mean?

28:09.660 --> 28:14.075
She saw that man.
She saw the man who took my boy.

28:14.437 --> 28:16.060
She saw him.

28:16.214 --> 28:18.536
- You have a witness?
- Yes.

28:18.691 --> 28:22.900
- And she will testify?
- Maybe. Her windows overlook the tracks.

28:23.054 --> 28:26.540
She saw Jora with a man.

28:32.591 --> 28:34.810
My boy was murdered.

28:34.964 --> 28:36.938
- You don't know this.
- I know it.

28:37.092 --> 28:40.511
And you don't lie to me,
because you know it, too.

28:40.666 --> 28:42.703
You know it.

28:43.275 --> 28:48.196
I want the coroner to do a full autopsy
on the Andreyev child.

29:04.309 --> 29:06.302
So I heard

29:06.456 --> 29:09.599
there was a problem
with Vasili in Kimov.

29:10.379 --> 29:12.498
I apologize.

29:13.373 --> 29:15.497
You're only flesh and blood.

29:16.173 --> 29:18.416
Striking a fellow officer

29:18.570 --> 29:22.619
can bring you the kind of attention
you could live without.

29:23.939 --> 29:28.683
But you did a great service
by talking to the Andreyevs.

29:29.500 --> 29:33.060
Alexei will thank you. One day.

29:34.067 --> 29:35.181
By the way,

29:36.562 --> 29:40.515
Brodsky. Full confession.

29:59.091 --> 30:02.608
He gave us seven names.

30:02.762 --> 30:04.939
Six went to others.

30:05.093 --> 30:08.442
Considering you're one
of my most thorough investigators,

30:08.596 --> 30:11.777
I gave you the toughest nut
of the bunch.

30:13.832 --> 30:17.137
So, you asked for a full autopsy
of that boy.

30:17.291 --> 30:21.022
- What's his name?
- Jora Alexei Andreyevich.

30:21.177 --> 30:22.771
- Jora?
- Da.

30:25.950 --> 30:30.483
This one is yours.
We don't have much, as you'll see.

30:30.637 --> 30:33.671
So you are to collect
further information.

30:33.826 --> 30:36.741
And if Brodsky was telling the truth,

30:36.895 --> 30:40.218
if that individual is a traitor,

30:40.372 --> 30:44.673
you are to arrest them
and bring them here.

30:46.314 --> 30:48.697
The usual process.

30:54.649 --> 30:56.098
Any questions?

31:17.014 --> 31:19.564
Raisa! Raisa!

31:20.553 --> 31:22.547
Raisa!

31:25.224 --> 31:26.867
- No, no, please, no.
- Please help me!

31:27.022 --> 31:29.304
- No, no, no, please.
- Raisa!

31:29.458 --> 31:30.799
She has no...

31:31.534 --> 31:35.109
- What is the charge? What is the charge?
- Raisa! Raisa!

31:44.936 --> 31:46.363
Why her?

31:46.517 --> 31:50.524
Because she couldn't keep her goddamn
opinion to herself. That's why.

31:56.312 --> 32:00.243
Ivan, maybe we should go
our separate ways.

32:01.134 --> 32:03.122
Raisa.

33:17.650 --> 33:19.077
Is she a traitor?

33:20.894 --> 33:22.759
They have a confession.

33:25.662 --> 33:28.907
And who took this confession?

33:29.061 --> 33:31.885
A colleague of mine.

33:34.102 --> 33:37.207
Could it have been manufactured?

33:38.798 --> 33:40.308
Of course.

33:41.105 --> 33:43.724
Do you have evidence?

33:46.586 --> 33:48.406
No.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.354
So what are you going to do?

33:52.776 --> 33:55.388
If I do not denounce...

33:55.542 --> 33:59.418
Raisa, and she is a traitor,
they have something on her

33:59.572 --> 34:03.698
that I don't know about,
I don't find or...

34:10.929 --> 34:15.246
Obviously, we are all guilty
by association, regardless.

34:16.005 --> 34:19.293
What did you expect when you came here?

34:19.447 --> 34:22.196
That we didn't mind dying?

34:22.350 --> 34:25.434
That Raisa would be saved?

34:26.451 --> 34:29.795
But if you don't denounce her,

34:29.949 --> 34:33.871
we will die. All four of us.

34:34.025 --> 34:35.681
But the only difference,

34:36.824 --> 34:41.484
that you would die knowing in your heart

34:41.638 --> 34:44.607
that you did the right thing.

34:46.458 --> 34:49.246
And so you calculate.

34:50.077 --> 34:53.092
One dead. Or four.

34:53.456 --> 34:56.672
One dead. Or four.

34:58.509 --> 35:00.748
Are you expecting somebody?

35:00.902 --> 35:04.529
It's Raisa. She always
eats with us on Wednesdays.

35:07.997 --> 35:10.811
- Anna.
- Oh, Raisa.

35:11.401 --> 35:13.806
Good to see you.

35:14.709 --> 35:17.494
He was working nearby.

35:17.734 --> 35:21.675
For once we can eat as a family.

35:29.954 --> 35:32.207
How was school?

35:32.362 --> 35:34.878
- Good.
- Good.

35:35.032 --> 35:38.929
And you've come here...
Did you walk straight from work?

35:39.083 --> 35:42.419
Normally, I would be,
but I had a doctor's appointment...

35:42.573 --> 35:44.848
- Doctor's appointment?
- ...at the Kuzminski Prospekt. Yes.

35:47.670 --> 35:49.501
You sick?

35:49.655 --> 35:51.567
- All right?
- Yes.

35:51.722 --> 35:54.574
- Not sick?
- No.

35:57.998 --> 36:00.643
Why do you go doctor?

36:02.816 --> 36:05.141
I wanted to tell you
when we're on our own.

36:07.839 --> 36:09.932
Why?

36:10.812 --> 36:13.038
We are all family here.

36:14.672 --> 36:17.887
We don't keep secrets from one another.

36:24.452 --> 36:26.128
I'm pregnant.

36:29.074 --> 36:31.879
That's wonderful news.

36:42.107 --> 36:43.773
Congratulations.

37:00.088 --> 37:04.226
- Excuse me.
- We are going to be grandparents.

38:26.967 --> 38:29.003
What?

38:35.432 --> 38:39.954
Kuzmin sent us. We're here to help.

38:44.392 --> 38:48.015
Very nice apartment.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.401
What are you doing?

39:10.921 --> 39:13.287
There is better way than that.

39:13.650 --> 39:16.365
That is not the way.

39:16.519 --> 39:19.552
You feel the cushions.

39:23.560 --> 39:26.491
You think it was me, don't you?

39:28.199 --> 39:32.470
But no one ever listens to me.
Don't you know that?

40:22.898 --> 40:24.392
Ivan, please!

40:26.106 --> 40:28.722
Ivan, please!

40:28.876 --> 40:32.691
Gentlemen, please.
She teaches domestic arts. Sewing.

40:32.846 --> 40:34.661
What could she have possibly...

40:51.826 --> 40:53.923
It's fine, it's fine.

41:01.698 --> 41:03.893
Purse.

41:51.380 --> 41:53.538
They took one of my colleagues today.

41:55.760 --> 41:59.592
Eva. Friend of mine.

42:00.766 --> 42:03.919
Do you know whose name...

42:04.073 --> 42:06.322
ended up on my desk?

42:11.047 --> 42:12.735
Can you imagine?

42:15.569 --> 42:17.657
- No.
- No?

42:22.306 --> 42:26.282
You. You have been named.

42:27.591 --> 42:29.565
Do you want to know by who?

42:33.300 --> 42:35.911
Anatoly Brodsky.

42:36.943 --> 42:39.316
Do you know him?

42:42.907 --> 42:45.327
Does it matter?

42:45.481 --> 42:47.127
Yes, it matters.

42:48.505 --> 42:50.600
It matters to me.

42:53.398 --> 42:55.300
They asked me...

42:55.975 --> 42:58.738
to denounce you.

43:04.077 --> 43:06.170
Raisa,

43:07.535 --> 43:09.567
are you a spy?

43:14.622 --> 43:16.610
No.

43:17.320 --> 43:19.093
No.

43:28.721 --> 43:32.798
You do know what happens
to us now, right?

43:34.507 --> 43:36.574
Yes.

43:40.248 --> 43:42.324
It's just our turn.

43:48.042 --> 43:52.040
Demidov, you asked
for the autopsy report.

43:52.611 --> 43:56.664
- I was forbidden to show it to you.
- Doesn't matter. It's not important now.

43:56.818 --> 44:00.638
I thought you might want to know.
There's been another one.

44:04.627 --> 44:08.662
- Another what?
- A train accident.

44:09.934 --> 44:11.192
What is it?

44:11.346 --> 44:15.015
Two boys. Found by the tracks.
Both naked. Same cause of death.

44:15.169 --> 44:17.075
- Which is?
- Drowning.

44:17.229 --> 44:19.114
- Drowning?
- But there are no rivers, no lakes

44:19.268 --> 44:21.827
next to the places
where they were found.

44:21.981 --> 44:26.184
And around the iris, hemorrhaging.
As with strangulation.

44:26.338 --> 44:27.895
There's one big difference
between the boys.

44:28.050 --> 44:30.184
- What's that?
- Jora Andreyevich,

44:30.338 --> 44:34.398
he had visual signs of trauma.
As if by torture.

44:35.595 --> 44:38.981
Cuts, Leo. Targeted. Not random.

44:40.301 --> 44:43.650
It was almost with surgical precision.

44:43.804 --> 44:46.554
Stomach removed. Missing.

44:46.708 --> 44:48.451
Water spilling from the boy.

44:48.606 --> 44:52.294
This is not the work
of some average idiot.

44:55.509 --> 44:59.184
You are sure you don't want
to reexamine your report?

44:59.338 --> 45:01.774
There is no need.

45:01.928 --> 45:04.654
- I found nothing.
- Leo...

45:07.181 --> 45:11.682
I am sure you realize what this means?

45:11.836 --> 45:17.192
Major Kuzmin, I have stood here
for the past 10 minutes

45:17.347 --> 45:20.930
telling you exactly the same thing.

45:21.084 --> 45:23.786
Because it is the truth.

45:24.455 --> 45:27.490
I found... nothing.

45:28.479 --> 45:31.685
Raisa Demidova

45:31.839 --> 45:34.444
is innocent.

46:10.779 --> 46:12.394
This is all you can take.

46:12.548 --> 46:17.004
You carry nothing on your person,
except your clothes and your papers.

46:17.159 --> 46:20.739
Alexei, why did you...

46:21.872 --> 46:25.206
That's fine. That's okay. All right.

46:26.207 --> 46:28.407
Please, give me five minutes because...

46:28.562 --> 46:30.043
- You know the rules, Leo.
- Please, five minutes.

46:30.198 --> 46:33.024
Just get dressed. You have two minutes.

46:33.178 --> 46:35.332
Want five.

46:36.396 --> 46:38.134
You fucking dog!
Don't you fucking touch her.

46:38.288 --> 46:40.495
- I will put him through the fucking window.
- It's fine. It's fine.

46:40.649 --> 46:43.381
- Jesus.
- Let her be.

46:43.535 --> 46:45.039
Here.

46:50.094 --> 46:53.921
- No! No, Leo! No, Leo!
- Where are you taking her?

46:57.388 --> 47:00.409
No, Leo!

47:16.552 --> 47:18.037
Raisa?

47:18.192 --> 47:20.669
- Raisa, are you there?
- Yes.

47:20.823 --> 47:22.664
- Did they hurt you?
- No.

47:23.027 --> 47:24.583
Good.

47:24.738 --> 47:27.647
Do exactly as they say. Raisa?

47:27.801 --> 47:30.795
You must not be scared. All right?

47:31.906 --> 47:35.106
I understand. Let go of me!

47:35.973 --> 47:38.827
Let go of me! I understand.

47:38.981 --> 47:42.935
Come here. It's okay, it's okay.

47:43.089 --> 47:46.498
- She is pregnant!
- What are they doing?

47:46.652 --> 47:49.902
It's all right. This is where
we wait for the truck, okay?

47:50.057 --> 47:52.367
Look, you see?
This is where the truck comes.

47:52.522 --> 47:54.043
They pick us up. They take us away.
Do you understand?

47:54.197 --> 47:56.866
- But where are we going?
- I don't know.

47:57.020 --> 48:00.884
It's okay. She's pregnant. Da?

48:01.039 --> 48:03.463
She's pregnant.

48:03.617 --> 48:07.721
Leo, where are we going?
Where are we going?

48:14.696 --> 48:18.776
I thought you'd like to see the place
one last time.

48:20.096 --> 48:22.714
I'm sentimental like that.

48:23.405 --> 48:26.278
Raisa. Raisa. Raisa.

48:31.907 --> 48:34.170
You're going to Volsk,
which, from what I've heard,

48:34.324 --> 48:36.996
is pretty much the asshole
of the earth, and join the Militsia.

48:37.568 --> 48:39.126
You know, all he had to do
was to denounce you,

48:39.280 --> 48:42.844
and in a year the whole building
would be kissing his ass.

48:43.624 --> 48:45.222
It was the only option.

48:46.432 --> 48:48.946
But you won't listen.

48:49.994 --> 48:52.445
Enjoy your new life.

49:17.887 --> 49:20.106
You know, this whole thing

49:20.260 --> 49:24.060
was just a test of blind obedience.

49:24.565 --> 49:26.576
You should have given me up.

49:28.607 --> 49:31.340
That's what wives are for.

50:42.495 --> 50:45.759
What are you waiting for?

50:47.770 --> 50:50.706
I only heard three days ago
you were coming.

50:51.735 --> 50:53.412
It's unusual.

50:53.566 --> 50:57.344
Because I made no requests
for additional men.

50:57.578 --> 51:02.283
And I'm a little confused
about the orders.

51:02.826 --> 51:07.511
The Militsia is a significant demotion
for a man of your stature.

51:07.665 --> 51:09.724
We go where we are needed.

51:09.878 --> 51:12.650
Do you know what I heard?

51:12.804 --> 51:15.901
I heard they made you take off
a dozen stolen watches

51:16.055 --> 51:18.486
before they handed you that flag.

51:23.756 --> 51:27.080
There are no advantages
to being in Militsia.

51:27.234 --> 51:30.998
Once an apartment is found,
you will be assigned.

51:31.673 --> 51:34.988
But it's a very long waiting list.

51:36.621 --> 51:39.041
You start tomorrow.

52:19.288 --> 52:22.414
The bar doesn't give credit.

52:22.568 --> 52:25.570
Toilet is down the hall.

52:53.097 --> 52:56.213
Comrade Director, Raisa Demidova.

52:56.367 --> 52:57.877
I have been assigned here.

52:58.031 --> 53:01.035
Would you be so kind
to show me to my classroom?

53:01.190 --> 53:03.074
Fine.

53:11.893 --> 53:14.324
Here is your classroom.

53:15.866 --> 53:20.181
If we need you for anything else,
we will tell you.

53:26.293 --> 53:28.341
Demidov.

53:35.537 --> 53:38.620
Varlam, wait! Varlam!

53:39.314 --> 53:42.823
- Goodbye, General Nesterov.
- Goodbye, Varlam.

53:43.394 --> 53:44.910
Let's go, Varlam.

53:45.064 --> 53:46.707
It's tragic.

53:46.861 --> 53:49.636
But even the party can't be responsible

53:49.790 --> 53:53.585
for the acts of a mental defective.

54:00.135 --> 54:03.147
Your rank is in my hands, you see.

54:03.822 --> 54:05.405
Yes, sir.

54:25.774 --> 54:27.867
We are here.

54:49.893 --> 54:52.195
It's a boy.

54:52.830 --> 54:55.428
He was found naked.

54:56.835 --> 54:59.237
They say he looks like he was tortured.

55:04.969 --> 55:10.190
I have two kids myself.
It makes me sick.

55:24.623 --> 55:27.062
It's been here a while.

55:27.332 --> 55:29.633
What's a while?

55:30.180 --> 55:31.861
Week. Two.

55:33.343 --> 55:37.043
It could be anyone from the orphanage.

55:37.647 --> 55:40.224
Perhaps he has a twin.

55:41.152 --> 55:43.314
A brother would be good
for identification.

55:43.469 --> 55:46.063
Excuse me, General.

55:46.520 --> 55:49.789
How old is he, about eight?
Eight years old?

55:53.631 --> 55:55.422
He has blood in his eyes.

55:56.973 --> 56:00.353
See? Is blood.

56:00.508 --> 56:03.521
Hemorrhaging.
You see it in strangulations.

56:03.675 --> 56:06.391
But look at his neck.
He has no track marks on his throat.

56:06.545 --> 56:10.091
So, what else can cause that?

56:10.245 --> 56:12.161
You also see it in drownings.

56:12.315 --> 56:15.656
Drowning. Yes.
Do you see any water around here?

56:17.925 --> 56:22.384
About 6 kilometers east.
The river in Tobol.

56:22.538 --> 56:25.189
6 kilometers.

56:25.988 --> 56:30.248
So, a drowned boy walks 6 kilometers?

56:30.402 --> 56:35.353
This is little boy.
Look, you see this cut here?

56:35.507 --> 56:37.793
It seems purposeful, no?

56:37.947 --> 56:41.493
They are. Someone knew their anatomy.

56:41.648 --> 56:43.398
Organs have been removed.

56:43.553 --> 56:48.139
And so you say organs have been
removed from this child's body?

56:51.634 --> 56:54.780
So it's what? We look for butcher?

56:54.934 --> 56:58.797
- We look for a hunter?
- More like a surgeon.

57:00.606 --> 57:03.412
More like surgeon?

57:05.378 --> 57:06.843
More like a surgeon.

57:07.788 --> 57:10.278
Will you excuse us?

57:14.481 --> 57:17.092
Why are you here?

57:17.560 --> 57:19.667
A child was murdered in Moscow...

57:19.821 --> 57:22.261
- What are you doing here?
- Water came out of his mouth.

57:22.416 --> 57:24.868
- Same as this child!
- Are you still working for the MGB?

57:25.022 --> 57:26.990
- No, I'm not MGB.
- I think you are.

57:27.144 --> 57:30.325
Why are you here? Why are these children
so important to Moscow?

57:30.479 --> 57:32.131
Believe me, these children
are not important to Moscow.

57:32.337 --> 57:34.924
Whatever it is
you've been sent here to do...

57:35.078 --> 57:38.295
remember, you are not in Moscow anymore.

57:38.449 --> 57:40.544
Here, we have an arrangement.

57:40.698 --> 57:43.920
If you do anything to endanger my team.

57:44.075 --> 57:46.702
If you report anything
which undermines my authority.

57:46.857 --> 57:51.438
If you portray my officers
as incompetent.

57:51.593 --> 57:54.867
If you do any of these things...

57:58.215 --> 58:00.929
I will kill you myself.

58:01.936 --> 58:04.370
General Nesterov!

58:05.274 --> 58:07.196
He has identification papers.

58:10.055 --> 58:14.681
Isaac Rudensky.
From the Gorsky School in Oblast X.

58:14.836 --> 58:17.633
Where exactly is Oblast X?

58:18.100 --> 58:22.346
50 kilometers east.
Seven stations down the line.

58:22.501 --> 58:24.611
General, if he came by train,
maybe the ticket master

58:24.765 --> 58:27.258
will recall seeing him with someone.

58:28.244 --> 58:30.499
Perhaps.

58:31.402 --> 58:33.684
Where's the ticket master?

58:33.838 --> 58:36.727
Aleksander. He's over there.

58:47.061 --> 58:49.220
Aleksander,

58:49.761 --> 58:52.114
when you found the body last night,

58:52.268 --> 58:56.170
you were taking a walk, you say?

58:56.324 --> 58:58.117
What's wrong?

59:01.773 --> 59:03.957
What? Are you okay?

59:08.702 --> 59:12.336
Or perhaps you were...
doing something else?

59:29.146 --> 59:31.222
Get in.

59:32.437 --> 59:33.366
Now.

59:46.829 --> 59:50.532
- Yes?
- <i>Put her on the phone.</i>

59:56.105 --> 59:57.415
Yes?

59:57.570 --> 01:00:00.670
<i>So, Raisa, I've been thinking.</i>

01:00:02.676 --> 01:00:04.590
Vasili.

01:00:04.745 --> 01:00:07.488
<i>You're getting a very bad deal here.
You know?</i>

01:00:07.642 --> 01:00:09.895
<i>I mean, for all these years,</i>

01:00:10.049 --> 01:00:12.726
good little mousewife and...

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.528
look at where you find yourself.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:20.119
Vasili, you know me.

01:00:20.899 --> 01:00:22.042
What have I done?

01:00:22.196 --> 01:00:25.220
<i>My point exactly.
So here's what I propose.</i>

01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:27.407
These guys will put you
on the next train to Moscow,

01:00:27.561 --> 01:00:29.539
and you can have your old job back.

01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:33.050
I will personally find you
a nice little place to live.

01:00:33.204 --> 01:00:36.691
<i>Assuming, of course, you wouldn't rather
move into your old apartment...</i>

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:38.898
with me.

01:00:40.922 --> 01:00:42.998
Leave Leo.

01:00:43.153 --> 01:00:44.412
Come on, Raisa, you never fooled me.

01:00:44.567 --> 01:00:48.100
All you ever wanted from him
was his head in a basket.

01:00:54.007 --> 01:00:55.454
No.

01:00:58.275 --> 01:01:00.055
No?

01:01:02.146 --> 01:01:04.283
No.

01:01:10.981 --> 01:01:15.841
<i>Okay. In that case...
You see that bald guy in a blue suit?</i>

01:01:17.034 --> 01:01:18.422
Yes.

01:01:18.785 --> 01:01:21.675
<i>You know what would be really nice?</i>

01:01:22.533 --> 01:01:23.798
No.

01:01:25.563 --> 01:01:28.056
Give him the phone.

01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:31.726
Wh... what?

01:01:32.735 --> 01:01:34.113
<i>Give him the phone.</i>

01:02:10.652 --> 01:02:12.744
Raisa?

01:02:47.661 --> 01:02:49.395
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:50.735
- Away.
- Away?

01:02:50.889 --> 01:02:53.486
- Yes.
- Listen to me, listen to me.

01:02:53.641 --> 01:02:56.036
Whatever you feel about me,
whatever is going on,

01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:59.600
whatever you are thinking,
we are here now. That is it.

01:02:59.754 --> 01:03:04.304
This is where we find ourselves.
There is nothing that we can do about this.

01:03:04.876 --> 01:03:09.657
I would rather spend a lifetime
in a shithole like this with you

01:03:09.811 --> 01:03:12.857
than spend one minute
in Moscow without you.

01:03:13.324 --> 01:03:15.241
Say that to someone
who doesn't know you.

01:03:15.396 --> 01:03:18.207
What are you gonna do without papers?
Did you forget something?

01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:20.627
- Yes, you forget these?
- Give me my papers.

01:03:20.781 --> 01:03:24.879
You know what happens to a woman
like you without papers?

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:27.629
She gets stopped. She gets arrested.

01:03:27.783 --> 01:03:29.638
She gets questioned.
Then guess what happens.

01:03:33.138 --> 01:03:35.526
Give me my papers.

01:04:04.571 --> 01:04:08.695
Don't you ever do that again.
Ever. Do you...

01:04:09.033 --> 01:04:12.060
So I'm your prisoner now?
Like everybody else?

01:04:14.946 --> 01:04:17.895
You want to kill me?

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.886
You had your chance in Moscow.

01:04:23.706 --> 01:04:27.721
The dinner we had with your parents.
I heard you when I came in the hallway.

01:04:28.292 --> 01:04:31.212
<i>Your beloved father
was pretty convincing.</i>

01:04:31.366 --> 01:04:35.361
<i>"Four lives against one." I just
stood there hearing him over and over.</i>

01:04:35.515 --> 01:04:38.044
"Four lives against one.
Four lives against one."

01:04:38.198 --> 01:04:40.258
What about four lives against two?

01:04:40.829 --> 01:04:44.522
Would you be so quick
to kill your own child?

01:04:45.106 --> 01:04:48.186
What do you mean by that?
What are you saying?

01:04:49.871 --> 01:04:53.369
Raisa, what do you mean by this?
Why you say that?

01:04:58.093 --> 01:05:00.135
No.

01:05:01.769 --> 01:05:04.321
No, no, you...

01:05:06.434 --> 01:05:08.059
You're not pregnant?

01:05:10.333 --> 01:05:12.974
I'm not pregnant.

01:05:17.155 --> 01:05:19.188
Are you saying you're not pregnant?

01:05:19.342 --> 01:05:22.710
Would you have stood up
for me if I wasn't?

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.429
I didn't want to die, Leo.

01:05:51.544 --> 01:05:53.299
Why are you saying this?

01:06:12.099 --> 01:06:14.141
Why?

01:06:16.774 --> 01:06:19.660
That story you love so much.

01:06:19.814 --> 01:06:21.338
When we first met.

01:06:21.492 --> 01:06:25.253
And I lied and I said
that my name was Lena.

01:06:25.408 --> 01:06:30.517
"Lena, Lena, Lena." So romantic.

01:06:32.627 --> 01:06:34.584
I gave you a false name

01:06:34.739 --> 01:06:39.661
because you had MGB written
all over you, and I was terrified.

01:06:42.076 --> 01:06:46.633
When you asked me to marry you,
I cried for one week.

01:06:50.161 --> 01:06:52.217
And then I said "yes."

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:58.120
I married you out of fear for what
would happen to me if I said "no."

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.696
You don't mean that.

01:07:04.908 --> 01:07:09.196
I married you
because that's what people do.

01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:11.896
They put up. They tolerate.

01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:15.282
They do whatever they need
to do to survive.

01:07:17.125 --> 01:07:19.656
"Marry me," you said.

01:07:20.581 --> 01:07:23.684
What choice did I have?

01:07:25.864 --> 01:07:28.940
What choice did I have?

01:07:48.419 --> 01:07:50.752
Homosexuality...

01:07:51.324 --> 01:07:54.021
is a serious crime.

01:07:57.999 --> 01:08:01.375
Please, just say...

01:08:02.174 --> 01:08:04.623
What do you want?

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:10.812
A list of men in this town
who have had sex with other men.

01:08:12.013 --> 01:08:13.252
What?

01:08:13.406 --> 01:08:17.474
Men who have had sex with younger men.

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:19.674
With boys.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.459
What?

01:08:22.613 --> 01:08:26.827
Fifteen years in the Gulag
is a long time.

01:08:26.981 --> 01:08:31.349
Even if you survive the camps,
you'll be disgraced.

01:08:31.502 --> 01:08:34.942
Please, just tell me what to do.

01:08:35.096 --> 01:08:39.742
If you open the door for us,

01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:44.173
maybe your... issue

01:08:44.745 --> 01:08:47.538
can remain a secret.

01:08:51.442 --> 01:08:55.689
Just a few names, Aleksander.

01:11:22.956 --> 01:11:24.806
Leo.

01:11:26.604 --> 01:11:29.036
Were you followed?

01:11:29.474 --> 01:11:31.652
Are you sure?

01:11:33.107 --> 01:11:35.703
What are you doing here?

01:11:36.277 --> 01:11:38.580
You tell me.

01:11:40.001 --> 01:11:42.362
What are you doing here?

01:11:42.516 --> 01:11:45.923
Aleksander could not have
killed this boy.

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:48.809
It's not possible.

01:11:49.389 --> 01:11:53.589
When I saw Jora,
he had the same cuts and marks

01:11:54.264 --> 01:11:55.738
as this child.

01:11:57.210 --> 01:12:02.770
Whoever killed this little boy,
killed Alexei's child, too. I know it.

01:12:03.818 --> 01:12:06.317
It's the truth.

01:12:06.471 --> 01:12:09.152
Just have to prove it.

01:12:11.416 --> 01:12:13.260
I must.

01:12:13.414 --> 01:12:16.980
I have to. I have to prove it.

01:12:17.134 --> 01:12:22.899
Leo, do you know what people get
around here when they demand the truth?

01:12:24.563 --> 01:12:26.725
Do you?

01:12:27.941 --> 01:12:30.083
They get terror.

01:12:32.670 --> 01:12:36.284
Raisa, we are already dead.

01:13:00.693 --> 01:13:02.889
Come inside.

01:13:03.897 --> 01:13:06.832
The killer, he's a traveler.

01:13:06.986 --> 01:13:09.416
We found a little boy

01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:11.866
10 minutes' walk from the track.

01:13:12.333 --> 01:13:15.942
I'm thinking how else could he get here,
if it was not for train?

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:19.707
- And then the boy in Moscow.
- Again with Moscow.

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:24.424
This boy in Moscow is the son
of a very good friend of mine.

01:13:24.892 --> 01:13:27.001
My brother.

01:13:27.484 --> 01:13:29.872
I was sent to his house
to read official report.

01:13:30.026 --> 01:13:35.539
I had to tell his family that his son
died of tragic accident. And I lied.

01:13:35.693 --> 01:13:38.881
So I'm thinking, how many
more children have to die?

01:13:39.035 --> 01:13:43.853
Get swept under the carpet.
Covered up by party dogs like you and I.

01:13:44.008 --> 01:13:47.185
And their blood is on our hands.

01:13:47.567 --> 01:13:50.662
And this animal, he will not
stop killing. This will not stop.

01:13:50.816 --> 01:13:54.779
- He will keep killing and killing.
- Enough!

01:13:58.412 --> 01:14:01.683
- What do you want?
- Me? I would like to stop him.

01:14:02.358 --> 01:14:05.811
- A ghost.
- Ghost? No, it's not ghost.

01:14:05.965 --> 01:14:08.109
Describe him to me then.

01:14:09.202 --> 01:14:11.109
I can't.

01:14:11.263 --> 01:14:14.249
I can't describe him. But...

01:14:14.404 --> 01:14:16.275
there is a witness.

01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:19.602
I must go back to Moscow
and speak with her.

01:14:19.756 --> 01:14:24.327
And you must gather the records of all
dead children from Moscow to Leningrad.

01:14:24.481 --> 01:14:26.595
Me?

01:14:26.749 --> 01:14:29.067
And why would I do that for you?

01:14:36.159 --> 01:14:38.543
Inessa, your boys,

01:14:39.219 --> 01:14:41.961
do they walk to school by themselves?

01:14:42.564 --> 01:14:47.344
Normally, yes. But this week,
with those poor children,

01:14:47.498 --> 01:14:49.049
either myself or...

01:14:50.844 --> 01:14:55.256
And from here to school, it seems
the shortest way is through the forest.

01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:56.825
Is that the way they go?

01:14:58.321 --> 01:14:59.794
Usually.

01:14:59.948 --> 01:15:04.207
But again, this week,
the way through town seems safer.

01:15:05.504 --> 01:15:07.543
Yes, of course.

01:15:08.022 --> 01:15:12.027
But now... now that the killer
has been caught,

01:15:12.181 --> 01:15:16.296
will they be going through the forest
by themself tomorrow as usual?

01:15:46.336 --> 01:15:47.980
Morning.

01:15:48.134 --> 01:15:50.269
Morning.

01:15:55.002 --> 01:15:57.317
Where are you headed to today?

01:15:57.471 --> 01:15:59.598
Nowhere.

01:16:03.042 --> 01:16:05.823
Just waiting to buy some stamps.

01:16:06.581 --> 01:16:09.563
But the kiosk isn't open yet.

01:16:09.717 --> 01:16:11.535
Collect stamps?

01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:14.393
Used to be a collector
when I was your age.

01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:19.363
Tell me, do you take care
of your collection?

01:16:20.039 --> 01:16:21.610
Yes.

01:16:23.973 --> 01:16:26.021
I have a son.

01:16:26.175 --> 01:16:28.411
About your age.

01:16:29.277 --> 01:16:31.704
Very messy boy.

01:16:32.067 --> 01:16:35.236
He could care less about stamps.

01:16:35.708 --> 01:16:37.953
As for me,

01:16:38.108 --> 01:16:41.142
just don't have the time
for them anymore.

01:16:42.249 --> 01:16:46.379
Maybe you should give them to someone
to take care of them for you.

01:16:46.533 --> 01:16:48.570
Yes.

01:16:55.959 --> 01:16:58.105
I bet you like sweets, don't you?

01:17:03.938 --> 01:17:06.014
I made them myself.

01:17:06.977 --> 01:17:09.718
Dark ones are the best.

01:17:10.422 --> 01:17:12.323
Good?

01:17:42.838 --> 01:17:45.025
General Nesterov.

01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:50.781
You know, Moscow is growing suspicious
of you summoning me like this.

01:17:50.936 --> 01:17:54.596
- I demand to...
- Bring me all files...

01:17:54.750 --> 01:18:00.721
involving the death of children
between the ages of 9 and 15.

01:18:02.206 --> 01:18:04.717
- Yes, sir.
- Everything you have.

01:18:04.872 --> 01:18:07.780
- Yes.
- And pray that they're all there.

01:18:40.064 --> 01:18:43.424
Stop crying. Sniveling shit!

01:18:43.578 --> 01:18:46.157
You four-eyed little pig.

01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.618
Oh, yes.

01:18:50.688 --> 01:18:56.281
A toast, mewling, sniveling little pig.

01:18:59.418 --> 01:19:02.442
One more time, to Joseph Stalin!

01:19:02.596 --> 01:19:05.274
Father to us all!

01:19:45.829 --> 01:19:48.394
There is a situation in Rostov.

01:19:49.382 --> 01:19:51.003
What situation?

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:56.202
A boy has been discovered
near the train station.

01:19:56.877 --> 01:20:01.197
They think he was attacked by a wolf.

01:20:10.021 --> 01:20:14.908
All children... ages 9 to 14.

01:20:15.294 --> 01:20:20.427
All found in forests, parks,
by the train lines.

01:20:20.894 --> 01:20:23.554
Naked and either marked...

01:20:23.708 --> 01:20:26.327
for cuts or with cuts.

01:20:26.481 --> 01:20:28.559
Drowned.

01:20:28.713 --> 01:20:31.982
When they bothered
to examine the remains,

01:20:33.075 --> 01:20:37.697
every one of them solved by arrest.

01:20:38.385 --> 01:20:41.175
Forty-three in all.

01:20:41.329 --> 01:20:42.487
Forty-four.

01:20:44.054 --> 01:20:47.071
My friend's son was murdered, too.

01:20:49.496 --> 01:20:51.956
And there's a...

01:20:52.111 --> 01:20:54.369
a new one in Rostov.

01:20:54.524 --> 01:20:56.572
I'm heading there tomorrow.

01:21:05.082 --> 01:21:06.288
Rostov.

01:21:09.586 --> 01:21:12.375
I have to go to Moscow.

01:21:13.695 --> 01:21:16.489
I need you to come with me.

01:21:18.288 --> 01:21:23.310
I cannot protect you
if you stay here alone.

01:21:23.464 --> 01:21:26.666
I don't need your protection anymore.

01:21:27.931 --> 01:21:30.946
If you come with me to Moscow,

01:21:31.101 --> 01:21:32.902
then I promise you,

01:21:33.056 --> 01:21:38.137
you have my word that I will do anything
and everything that you want.

01:21:39.111 --> 01:21:40.187
Whatever it is you ask.

01:21:40.341 --> 01:21:45.749
If you want to leave Volsk, if you want
to leave me, if you want to leave.

01:21:49.886 --> 01:21:52.630
You never ever even
have to see me again.

01:21:52.784 --> 01:21:55.505
I promise. You may have my word.

01:21:58.015 --> 01:22:03.258
Tomorrow morning, you'll have your
identity papers for the train to Moscow.

01:22:03.621 --> 01:22:06.193
I've granted you a walking holiday.

01:22:06.869 --> 01:22:11.526
That'll explain your absence from here.

01:22:55.687 --> 01:22:59.299
What are you doing here, Leo?
You're not supposed to be here.

01:22:59.454 --> 01:23:01.334
Alexei, it's about your son.
He was murdered.

01:23:01.488 --> 01:23:04.431
You've come to the wrong address.
No boy was murdered here.

01:23:04.585 --> 01:23:08.449
No, no, no. I've made a mistake.
It's not true. It's not true.

01:23:08.603 --> 01:23:10.110
I was wrong.

01:23:10.264 --> 01:23:14.188
I was wrong, you were right.
I have the papers here. His...

01:23:14.342 --> 01:23:17.739
His death certificate says
much more than we know of.

01:23:17.893 --> 01:23:20.155
- Look.
- From Moscow train station

01:23:20.309 --> 01:23:24.111
all the way down the train tracks
to Rostov. It's very serious.

01:23:25.516 --> 01:23:28.620
And if you find this man, Leo,

01:23:29.659 --> 01:23:32.411
- what will you do?
- I bring him to justice.

01:23:33.086 --> 01:23:36.361
- You will bring him to justice?
- Da.

01:23:37.856 --> 01:23:41.461
You're nobody anymore, Leo.
You're nobody.

01:23:41.616 --> 01:23:46.255
How you gonna bring him to justice?
Just the two of you?

01:23:46.409 --> 01:23:48.754
Is this a joke?

01:23:50.074 --> 01:23:52.052
Leo, if you really wanna help,

01:23:52.206 --> 01:23:55.364
you find this man
and you cut his head off!

01:23:55.518 --> 01:23:57.944
Can you do that?

01:24:02.528 --> 01:24:04.576
Yes.

01:24:05.791 --> 01:24:09.295
For you, Alexei, I will do this.

01:24:10.761 --> 01:24:13.477
But if I do that,

01:24:13.631 --> 01:24:16.432
then nobody will ever know.

01:24:17.439 --> 01:24:19.578
Please.

01:24:20.479 --> 01:24:23.733
Nina, we need to see the witness.

01:24:27.836 --> 01:24:31.032
How can I help? I don't know anything.

01:24:32.117 --> 01:24:34.927
Listen, Galina,

01:24:35.082 --> 01:24:39.126
the man that killed my son,
he's still out there,

01:24:39.281 --> 01:24:41.400
killing other children,
do you understand?

01:24:41.555 --> 01:24:44.613
Nobody, nobody can get into any trouble

01:24:44.767 --> 01:24:48.699
by simply describing what a worker
looked like on his way to work.

01:24:48.854 --> 01:24:51.415
Do you understand? It's not possible.

01:24:51.569 --> 01:24:54.008
He's here, talking to you. I'm here.

01:24:54.162 --> 01:24:56.656
I guarantee you I am no threat.
You have my word.

01:24:56.811 --> 01:24:59.284
Look at me. I have no uniform.

01:24:59.438 --> 01:25:04.485
I promise you, you are safe
to speak to me, so please.

01:25:08.116 --> 01:25:10.020
It was dark.

01:25:10.695 --> 01:25:12.019
- Yes?
- Please.

01:25:12.173 --> 01:25:14.658
Galina! What's going on?

01:25:15.318 --> 01:25:17.194
Galina! Who are you talking to?

01:25:17.348 --> 01:25:19.942
Please, whisper to me.
What did he look like?

01:25:20.096 --> 01:25:23.205
We are just making conversation.
There is no problem here. Please.

01:25:23.359 --> 01:25:26.695
- Get out of my house!
- Calm down. Please, calm down. Take it easy.

01:25:26.849 --> 01:25:29.594
Easy? You want easy? You want easy?

01:25:29.749 --> 01:25:32.417
- Raisa, I have to go.
- Please, you must remember something.

01:25:32.571 --> 01:25:34.431
Get out!

01:25:58.888 --> 01:26:01.477
Are you on your own?

01:26:03.085 --> 01:26:05.702
Does your mother know where you are?

01:26:09.984 --> 01:26:12.266
Is that heavy?

01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:15.901
It's heavier than it looks.

01:26:16.055 --> 01:26:17.554
I could carry it.

01:26:19.347 --> 01:26:22.641
All right then. Up you get.

01:26:25.648 --> 01:26:28.438
Let's see what you're made of.

01:26:33.969 --> 01:26:35.961
Hello!

01:26:37.298 --> 01:26:41.447
Son, you're getting far too heavy
for me to carry.

01:26:41.601 --> 01:26:42.797
- Hi.
- Hello, sweetheart.

01:26:42.951 --> 01:26:46.453
- What did I tell you?
- I wanted to meet Daddy.

01:26:48.199 --> 01:26:51.171
What are you worried about?
He's with me.

01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:56.108
Come on.

01:27:00.012 --> 01:27:02.168
In the war,

01:27:02.323 --> 01:27:05.209
Hitler left hidden revenge squads

01:27:05.363 --> 01:27:07.757
all the way back to the Rhine.

01:27:07.911 --> 01:27:11.617
I saw what those German soldiers
were capable of.

01:27:11.772 --> 01:27:14.346
Is there anything else?

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.302
He fed them...

01:27:16.456 --> 01:27:19.067
special drugs...
