26:50.478 --> 26:53.133
OK. Uh, cool.

27:05.014 --> 27:06.712
So...

27:06.842 --> 27:09.018
I don't think I can
resist you much longer.

27:09.149 --> 27:11.455
Yeah, me neither.

27:11.586 --> 27:13.501
To be continued?

27:13.632 --> 27:16.025
Def-definitely.
Definitely to, to be continued.

27:20.247 --> 27:22.336
I had the best fucking date
of my life with you tonight.

27:22.466 --> 27:25.644
Yeah...

27:25.774 --> 27:26.993
Yeah, me too.

27:29.778 --> 27:32.389
Look, I, I, um,
I know this feels...

27:32.520 --> 27:35.305
kinda shitty,
right now, but...

27:35.436 --> 27:38.004
I mean, tomorrow, we're gonna
be so glad that we waited.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.223
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

27:40.354 --> 27:42.661
[ laughs ]

27:42.791 --> 27:45.141
OK, uh, yeah.

27:45.272 --> 27:47.491
-I'll walk you to your car.-OK, cool.

27:51.495 --> 27:52.845
[ sighs ]

27:54.977 --> 27:56.457
Ready?

27:56.587 --> 27:58.241
Mmm-hmm, yeah.

28:01.375 --> 28:02.942
Let's, let's go.

28:03.072 --> 28:04.421
OK.

28:09.165 --> 28:11.341
Fuck tomorrow.

28:11.472 --> 28:13.517
