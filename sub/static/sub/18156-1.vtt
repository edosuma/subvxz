00:24.600 --> 00:27.200
As I said, through
our mutual friend in Burma...

00:27.400 --> 00:30.300
...I thought maybe everybody
could be understanding here.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.900
We just want peace.
You guys have the whole of Burma.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.200
Stay there, leave us alone
and tell my friend I said hello.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.000
We respect him.
We're staying out of his face.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.000
We run a really big operation here.

00:43.200 --> 00:47.400
Sometimes things like this,
it happens.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.500
We've been doing business
for a while.

00:52.700 --> 00:55.800
You keep your territory,
we keep ours.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.100
This arrangement works.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.100
Right? War's never good
for business.

01:04.400 --> 01:09.800
Yes, you're right. The last thing
we need is an enemy in the CIA.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.500
Cross!

02:24.400 --> 02:27.800
Help! Help!

03:28.700 --> 03:30.900
Yeah, it's all clear.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.300
Check the front gate?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.300
Done.

03:44.900 --> 03:46.900
- Check the north side?
- Yeah.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.800
Done. It's clear.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.800
- You don't see anything over there?
- I can't see nothing.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.700
I checked it. It's clear.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.100
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, baby, everything okay?

06:14.300 --> 06:16.700
Everything's great. How are you?

06:16.900 --> 06:19.700
- Hey, did you get the list I left you?
- Not yet.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.200
I can't believe you.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.900
Well, listen.
Don't forget to feed the fish.

06:24.100 --> 06:27.000
And remember, Maria comes in
on Wednesdays.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.800
And take care of yourself, okay?

06:29.000 --> 06:32.500
- Don't drink too much coffee.
- Don't worry about me.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.700
Hey...

06:35.400 --> 06:36.700
...let me talk to Brice.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.500
Dad, how did you know?

06:43.200 --> 06:46.500
Baby, when are you gonna understand
I know everything?

06:46.700 --> 06:49.900
Listen, Daddy, I love you.
Take care of yourself, okay?

06:50.100 --> 06:52.200
All right. Love you. Bye.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
- What?
- Nothing.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.400
Shut up, asshole.
My dad's the best.

07:01.600 --> 07:05.100
- Come on, guys. We've got to go.
- The train leaves in two hours.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.500
All right.

07:06.700 --> 07:08.700
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.900
Watch out over there, man.

07:50.100 --> 07:54.000
Yeah. All right. It's not like
it's gonna break or anything.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.200
It's time for you to die.
It's time for you to die.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.200
You're giving me a headache!

08:04.400 --> 08:05.600
- You all right?
- Yep.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.600
Okay.

08:10.100 --> 08:11.600
Hey...

08:12.600 --> 08:15.700
...so why didn't you tell your dad
that I...?

08:15.900 --> 08:18.100
That I was coming with you?

08:18.800 --> 08:21.800
He's... He's protective.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.300
After Mom died...

08:24.500 --> 08:26.500
...I'm all he's got.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.100
All right.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.799
He's a good guy.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.200
Like I hope you will be.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.800
And now for the latest world news.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.900
Officials search for evidence
after a bomb destroyed...

08:59.100 --> 09:01.400
...a police station in Thailand
this morning.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.800
Fourteen military police were killed.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.600
- Gen. Jantapan of Special Forces...
- Come on, it's so boring!

09:07.700 --> 09:09.600
- Music!
...assures the community...

09:09.800 --> 09:12.100
...no stone will remain unturned.
- Music!

09:12.200 --> 09:14.800
Enjoy yourself!

09:15.800 --> 09:17.800
Yeah, that's more like it.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.800
- Oh, my God!
- No!

10:00.400 --> 10:02.300
No! Oh, my God!

10:04.900 --> 10:08.000
Out of the water. Quickly.

10:23.100 --> 10:27.100
- Hey, you can have all our money.
- It's not about the money.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.100
- No!
- Brice!

10:46.400 --> 10:47.700
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey, Jake.

10:47.900 --> 10:49.300
Two days early.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.800
Listen, the agency know
you're still using me?

10:53.000 --> 10:56.400
No. No, this is just between
you and me.

10:57.100 --> 10:59.400
Well, let's keep it that way.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.800
Listen, there's something else.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.800
- We got a tape today.
- What are you talking about?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.600
There's no two ways to put this.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.300
Jessica and the Winthorpe girl
were kidnapped.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.600
You're kidding.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.800
- Does this have to do...?
- No. Absolutely not.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.500
- They don't even know who Jessica is.
- Well, is it money or...?

11:27.700 --> 11:29.800
We don't know anything yet.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.500
Well, is she okay?

11:35.800 --> 11:37.300
She's alive.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.200
The Abu Karaf can no longer
not do anything...

11:51.700 --> 11:55.400
...when our brothers are tortured
and oppressed.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.800
These prisoners of war
will be executed...

11:59.000 --> 12:02.500
...within a week if our demands
are not met.

12:02.600 --> 12:07.800
All members of the Abu Karaf must
be released with full pardons.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.700
I demand an immediate response!

12:11.900 --> 12:14.400
They got a list of demands
as long as your arm.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.200
We have a good relationship
with General Jantapan.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.400
He favors direct action
and is offering full cooperation.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
Gentlemen, I'm sure you understand
the sensitivity of the situation.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.700
We have to ensure
this stays in the family.

12:28.800 --> 12:32.200
Nothing is released without
my express permission.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.500
We must resolve this without harm to
the girls or the reputation of the U.S.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.300
We agree fully.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.400
That's why I'm putting
Agent Washington in charge.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.100
He's been operating
in the area for four years...

12:44.300 --> 12:46.400
...and is more than qualified
for the job.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.300
- Leon?
- Thank you, sir.

12:51.300 --> 12:55.000
The first picture you have there
is the current head of the Abu Karaf.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.200
Name's Mongkol.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.600
Since he took over...

12:58.700 --> 13:01.800
...they've become more hostile
towards the government.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.100
The usual stuff.

13:03.300 --> 13:06.100
Ambushing police patrols,
small rudimentary bombs.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.700
- Anything like this before?
- Nothing, sir.

13:09.900 --> 13:12.200
- Where's their money from?
- Arms, mainly.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.800
- What about this Hopper guy?
- He's a good man, sir.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.800
It's a damn shame his daughter's
caught up in this.

13:18.900 --> 13:20.500
Tom, didn't you work with him?

13:20.800 --> 13:24.000
I trained under him for two years
in Southeast Asia.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.800
- He's been out for 10 years, though.
- Where is he?

13:28.000 --> 13:31.700
He left Honolulu four hours ago.
Lands in Sangoon at 6 a.m.

13:31.900 --> 13:34.600
Sit on him.
If he starts making waves...

13:34.800 --> 13:37.100
...pick him up, send him home.
- Yes, sir.

13:37.300 --> 13:38.400
That's all.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.500
Thank you.
I got a plane to catch.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.900
Taxi service this way, sir.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.900
Come on. Right here.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.200
Excuse me, excuse me.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.000
This way, please.

14:07.400 --> 14:10.500
- Is this your first time in this town?
- No.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.600
Hey, where you come from?

14:14.300 --> 14:17.400
- Far away.
- Far away will be England, right?

14:17.600 --> 14:18.800
Close enough.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.100
All right. If you need something,
just tell me.

14:22.300 --> 14:24.500
- I'll get it for you, you know.
- Okay.

14:24.700 --> 14:27.100
You know, this town,
I'm telling you.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.500
There is the beautiful girls,
like angels.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.900
We have those younger, sexy girls.
We have a lot of bars here.

14:33.100 --> 14:37.400
Not only, we have a specialty
massage here in this town.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.000
It's very nice here.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.000
I just need you to get me
where I asked you, okay?

14:42.200 --> 14:45.200
Yeah, I'm going this place
that you want to go...

14:45.400 --> 14:48.200
...but I want to give you
information about the town.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.200
If you like to drink some beers...

14:50.400 --> 14:53.300
...we have young girls,
look good, here...

14:53.500 --> 14:55.900
...nice brown, black.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.300
You'll see, you'll love it.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.800
The ride is over.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.000
- How long will you stay?
- A week or two.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.000
- How would you like to pay?
- Cash.

18:11.200 --> 18:14.200
Okay, would you please
sign your name?

18:50.600 --> 18:53.100
Come back, you asshole!
Fuck you!

18:53.300 --> 18:55.600
Open the fucking door!

18:55.800 --> 18:58.800
- Don't go! Fuck you! Fuck you.
- Come back here!

20:24.600 --> 20:27.600
- You know my situation.
- Yes, sir.

20:27.800 --> 20:31.400
It's become an international issue,
and I'm under a lot of pressure.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.600
I understand, sir.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.400
It's my men that are being killed
by the Abu Karaf.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.100
We're working with the CIA
to finalize plans.

20:40.700 --> 20:44.100
Just make sure you don't act
without consulting me.

20:44.300 --> 20:47.800
- We can't afford to upset anyone else.
- Yes, sir.

20:48.100 --> 20:51.200
Don't let this get out of control.

21:38.900 --> 21:41.400
He won't leave me alone.

21:42.500 --> 21:45.900
- What's your problem, junior?
- Asshole, you calling me a junior?

21:46.700 --> 21:50.000
- You look like junior.
- Oh, you think you're tough, huh?

21:50.200 --> 21:53.100
She's paid for, so it ain't
got nothing to do with you.

21:53.300 --> 21:54.900
I work for club, not you.

21:55.100 --> 21:58.200
What you mean, you work
for the club, bitch? You work for me.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.200
Why don't you go back
to your own genetic puddle...

22:01.400 --> 22:03.800
...and go for a swim, boy.

22:04.400 --> 22:08.100
So you think you're tough,
you walking in here, huh?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.500
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm...

22:33.600 --> 22:37.000
What's going on? Get out of the way.
What's going...?

22:38.200 --> 22:39.800
Jake.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
- We've got to talk.
- Let's go have a beer.

22:43.400 --> 22:46.200
My old buddy, Jake Hopper.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.500
So, what's up?

22:51.700 --> 22:55.200
- You here on business or...?
- I got a little problem.

23:02.100 --> 23:04.900
That's not like you, Jake.
Mr. Clean.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.400
No, it's nothing like that.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.800
It's Jessica.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.500
I'm afraid she's been kidnapped.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.300
What do you...?
I mean, where?

23:16.500 --> 23:19.500
Well, they say with the Abu Karaf
up north, but...

23:19.700 --> 23:23.500
...I don't know too many Muslims be
up there, so something's funny.

23:23.800 --> 23:27.300
- What do they want from you?
- I don't think it has to do with me.

23:27.500 --> 23:30.700
Jessica's friend is the daughter
of Senator John Winthorpe...

23:30.900 --> 23:34.400
...and I think maybe that's
what they were after.

23:34.600 --> 23:37.500
- Shit, man. I'm sorry.
- Listen, Fitch...

23:37.700 --> 23:40.200
...I've been out of the game
for 10 years.

23:41.300 --> 23:43.000
I need some goddamn help.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.700
Listen, man, I mean...

23:45.900 --> 23:49.100
I'm not on the inside
anymore, you know?

23:50.200 --> 23:52.400
I've got some contacts.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.900
Yeah, I'll check it out.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.100
They've been giving this government
a serious headache.

23:58.200 --> 24:02.200
- Do the best you can, you hear?
- I'll do whatever it takes, Jake.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.100
- Excuse me. Jake, right?
- Yeah.

24:25.500 --> 24:29.000
- I want to thank you for what you did.
- You're welcome.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.400
- Where are you going?
- Back to the hotel.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.100
- Which hotel?
- Songwat.

24:33.700 --> 24:36.700
Oh. Well, maybe we could
get something to eat.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.100
- Something nice.
- Yeah, but I'm not hungry.

24:39.300 --> 24:40.800
Thanks.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.400
Mom...

25:10.500 --> 25:13.000
...I want you to find Dad.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.600
We're gonna need his help.

25:16.900 --> 25:18.800
I love you, Mom.

26:31.300 --> 26:32.400
Help!

27:35.000 --> 27:37.600
Brother, I haven't forgotten
my English.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.100
- You're looking very good.
- Thank you.

27:40.300 --> 27:44.800
- Must be the haircut.
- And how are your wounds?

27:46.000 --> 27:49.600
- Better.
- And how is your heart?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.100
Healing nicely.

27:53.600 --> 27:56.200
I haven't forgotten that day, Jake.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.600
I'm very, very proud of you.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.600
You stay a full monk
for 10 years...

28:08.800 --> 28:10.500
Really, really wonderful.

28:10.700 --> 28:13.400
Then again, I think you're
the lucky one...

28:13.900 --> 28:16.000
...because your life is simple.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.400
Simple is good.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.500
Simple is very good. I wish I had
simple in my life right now.

28:22.800 --> 28:27.200
Jake, I'd like to think you came all
the way out here to see me...

28:27.400 --> 28:30.300
...but I don't think so.
Is everything all right?

28:31.400 --> 28:33.400
It's Jessica.

28:34.300 --> 28:36.300
She's been kidnapped.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.000
What?

28:38.800 --> 28:39.900
By who?

28:40.200 --> 28:43.400
Well, they're saying the Abu Karaf,
but I don't think so.

28:43.700 --> 28:47.000
- Is there anything I can do?
- Your prayers.

28:47.500 --> 28:50.400
I'm going to go see
Paijan Paitoon.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.000
- How are you?
- Good.

30:11.300 --> 30:13.800
- How was your flight?
- Long. Very long.

30:13.900 --> 30:15.600
You must be exhausted.
Come.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.000
- Have some tea.
- Sure.

30:18.800 --> 30:22.100
We've got a unit of rangers that
can mobilize whenever I say so.

30:22.300 --> 30:24.800
But I need intel, bad.

30:26.300 --> 30:28.000
This is a preliminary report.

30:28.200 --> 30:32.400
It covers what we know of the
Abu Karaf and their known locations.

30:32.800 --> 30:35.600
I don't have the resources
to deal with this for you.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.900
I fully understand, and we'll offer
whatever you need.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.900
I'm very grateful.

30:41.100 --> 30:44.600
Until there are dead bodies,
my priority is the girls.

30:44.800 --> 30:45.800
Of course.

30:47.200 --> 30:51.400
I'm sorry that these animals have
involved such innocent children.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.100
You have to eat something.

31:01.300 --> 31:03.600
I'm not hungry.

31:05.300 --> 31:07.300
You need to eat to keep
your strength.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.700
We have to stay positive.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.800
I know my dad's gonna
do something about this.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.000
He can't help us.

31:20.900 --> 31:22.500
He can't.

31:25.700 --> 31:28.200
You don't know my dad.

31:30.400 --> 31:33.200
For 10 years, I have
pledged my life...

31:33.400 --> 31:35.800
...to atone for my past.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.600
This is my life.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.100
But now going back on this road...

31:43.500 --> 31:45.900
...I have great trepidation.

31:46.100 --> 31:48.600
If you walk this road...

31:48.800 --> 31:50.800
...you may not come back.

31:53.900 --> 31:56.400
I will take with me...

31:56.600 --> 31:58.400
...everything you have taught me.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.900
It is your choice.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.400
Thank you, master.

32:35.700 --> 32:38.800
- What are you doing here?
- I come to bring you food.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.500
- Did Fitch put you up to this?
- No.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.600
He does not even know I'm here.

32:44.900 --> 32:45.900
Okay.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.400
Am I disturbing something?

32:50.600 --> 32:54.700
No, not at all. Come in.

32:54.900 --> 32:57.600
- And she is...?
- Lulu, a good friend of mine.

33:01.600 --> 33:05.400
Hey, thanks for the food.
Okay? I'll call you.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.000
What are you doing here?

33:13.200 --> 33:15.600
I gave back my vows.
I'm here to help you.

33:15.700 --> 33:17.100
You need to leave now.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.700
I've spoken to Master Paitoon.
He understands.

33:19.900 --> 33:22.800
You'll screw up the last 10 years
of what you've done.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.400
I don't want you involved.

33:24.600 --> 33:29.000
Jake, you know I'll do
anything for you.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.500
I owe you my life.

33:30.700 --> 33:32.500
Brother, listen to me.

33:32.700 --> 33:34.500
You don't owe me anything...

33:35.000 --> 33:36.800
...but thank you.

33:40.700 --> 33:42.600
Listen, I may have a lead for you.

33:42.800 --> 33:46.200
A man by the name
of Fernand Zadir, a French Arab.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.500
- Who is he?
- Algeria originally...

33:48.700 --> 33:50.700
...then France.
Been here 15 years.

33:50.900 --> 33:53.400
Started in furniture but moved up
to bigger stuff.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.000
Bigger stuff meaning arms.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.800
Yes. And you know who runs
most of his business?

33:58.000 --> 34:00.300
- Abu Karaf.
- Exactly.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.300
Let's do it.

34:13.699 --> 34:17.199
That's Fernand Zadir. He's got
half the local police in his pocket.

34:17.400 --> 34:20.300
The other half likes eating here
too much to bust him.

34:20.500 --> 34:21.699
Who's that girl?

34:21.900 --> 34:25.199
Her name is Lena.
She works for someone rather big.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.500
Well, let's find out how big.

34:42.699 --> 34:45.100
I want to talk to your boss, huh?

34:47.800 --> 34:50.300
Please, sit down.

34:55.900 --> 34:57.200
What can I do for you?

34:57.400 --> 35:00.300
I was wondering if you could
pass on a message for me.

35:00.400 --> 35:04.000
- Who to?
- To the Abu Karaf.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.400
What business have you got
with them?

35:06.600 --> 35:09.400
Probably none, but some say
they had something to do...

35:09.600 --> 35:12.400
...with the kidnapping of my daughter.
- Are you sure?

35:12.600 --> 35:15.500
I'm not sure at all, but I thought
we should meet...

35:15.700 --> 35:17.700
...and straighten things out.

35:18.300 --> 35:20.600
Well, that is very unfortunate...

35:20.800 --> 35:23.800
...but I'm afraid I cannot be
of any help.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.800
Pass on the message.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.300
- Hey, Fitch. How you doing?
- Jake, how are you?

35:39.500 --> 35:43.100
- All right. How are you doing?
- All right. Lulu, come here.

35:45.300 --> 35:48.000
I'm gonna get you laid if it kills me.

35:48.200 --> 35:50.500
It's not what I had in mind.
What do you got?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.100
I've got a guy coming in
from Singapore...

35:53.300 --> 35:55.600
...says he did business
with the Abu Karaf.

35:55.800 --> 35:59.200
- When's he coming in?
- Says he's busy. Two days.

36:00.800 --> 36:06.900
Okay. Well, listen, did you ever hear
of a guy called Fernand Zadir?

36:07.100 --> 36:09.100
- No.
- You sure?

36:09.300 --> 36:12.100
Sure, man. I can find out.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.700
You do that.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.300
Okay. Yeah, man.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.500
- I will see him to the door.
- Yeah, you do that.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.900
Jake, I need to talk to you.

36:27.100 --> 36:29.900
- About what?
- I can't tell you here.

36:31.800 --> 36:35.900
There's something I need to tell you.
Fitch lied to you about Fernand Zadir.

36:37.300 --> 36:39.400
- How do you know that?
- He does know him.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.900
I have seen him at the club.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.800
- What else?
- Nothing. I have just seen him.

36:45.100 --> 36:47.800
I've only been working there
for three months.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.200
So, what are you doing here?

36:50.400 --> 36:53.100
I have some personal problems
with my daughter.

36:55.100 --> 36:59.000
- How long will you be staying here?
- I really don't know.

37:01.300 --> 37:04.500
Listen, there's something
I want you to do for me.

37:43.100 --> 37:44.700
Bridgeport?

37:49.300 --> 37:52.900
"Sang Kom train yard tomorrow."

37:54.800 --> 37:56.800
Yeah. How you doing? All right?

37:57.000 --> 37:59.100
All right, keep going. Good, good.

37:59.300 --> 38:01.400
All right, I'll see you in a bit.

38:01.700 --> 38:04.200
I gotta check
on this air conditioning.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.200
Yeah.

38:17.900 --> 38:19.900
You did what?

38:22.400 --> 38:26.300
If the boss found out you sent it
by the fucking fax, he'd kill you.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
Don't be such a fucking idiot.
Of course I won't be there.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.200
Go by yourself.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.600
Be there at noon.

38:56.600 --> 39:00.000
- I thought I could come with you.
- Okay.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.700
Go home.

39:01.900 --> 39:03.900
- Jake.
- Yeah?

39:04.100 --> 39:05.900
Be careful.

41:33.600 --> 41:36.600
Okay. Somebody up there
about to snipe Mongkol.

41:37.500 --> 41:41.200
If I let him do that, I could lose
the only link to my daughter...

41:41.400 --> 41:44.900
...and I can't let that happen.
If I shoot him...

41:45.200 --> 41:48.100
...a whole world of trouble's
gonna come down on us.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.900
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

45:47.300 --> 45:49.700
Some men were killed today.

45:49.900 --> 45:51.700
You are responsible.

45:53.700 --> 45:55.600
I know who you are.

45:55.900 --> 45:59.700
Okay, so, what would you like me
to do?

46:06.200 --> 46:10.200
Mr. Hopper, you disturbed
an important anti-terror raid.

46:10.400 --> 46:12.500
That's not true, and you know it.

46:12.700 --> 46:17.400
Maybe a few days here
will help you understand.

46:17.600 --> 46:21.100
Our hospitality is famous.

46:21.300 --> 46:24.400
- I think that'd be a big mistake.
- No, Mr. Hopper.

46:24.600 --> 46:27.200
You made a big mistake
by coming here.

46:50.800 --> 46:52.000
Wait. Hold it.

46:52.200 --> 46:55.400
Captain, tell your men
not to do anything stupid.

47:00.700 --> 47:02.900
- Let him go, Jake.
- Leon, Leon.

47:03.100 --> 47:06.700
My daughter's rotting somewhere
in a goddamn hole.

47:06.900 --> 47:09.200
Do you expect me to get
with your program...

47:09.300 --> 47:12.700
...while they're jerking our chains?
- You won't leave alive...

47:12.800 --> 47:14.900
...without me. Do you hear?
- We'll see.

47:15.100 --> 47:16.900
Jake.

47:17.600 --> 47:19.600
He's coming with me.

47:26.600 --> 47:29.100
I'll take full responsibility.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.900
Next time I see you,
I put a bullet in your head.

47:40.100 --> 47:42.600
- Go for it.
- Key.

47:45.400 --> 47:47.300
I'll contact you later.

47:49.400 --> 47:52.600
I'm taking you to the airport.
Leave this to us, Jake.

47:52.800 --> 47:57.200
You look smart. We can do this the
hard or easy way. How you want it?

47:57.300 --> 48:00.700
- I hope you're not threatening me.
- You know me better than that.

48:00.900 --> 48:02.900
Listen to me. This is my daughter.

48:03.100 --> 48:05.700
What that means is, anybody
who stands in my way...

48:05.900 --> 48:09.300
...it's gonna be them or me.
- I don't want you in a body bag.

48:09.400 --> 48:11.800
You ain't gonna have to worry
about that.

48:16.200 --> 48:18.400
You got something else to say?

48:19.100 --> 48:21.800
I won't be here the next time, Jake.

49:05.900 --> 49:08.000
Help me!

49:08.600 --> 49:11.700
Jessica! Jessica!

49:12.100 --> 49:15.200
No! No!

49:26.700 --> 49:28.400
No! No!

49:29.400 --> 49:31.100
Stop!

49:31.700 --> 49:33.800
- Boss needs her.
- She killed my brother.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.200
Get the body out of here,
leave her alone.

49:36.400 --> 49:37.700
Get up!

49:38.600 --> 49:41.100
The time will come.

50:25.700 --> 50:28.400
Jade, I'm home.

50:28.900 --> 50:30.600
Jade?

50:39.100 --> 50:42.200
They killed her roommates,
and your hotel is full of police.

50:42.400 --> 50:44.300
This place is safe.

51:03.900 --> 51:05.800
We've gotta find this guy Fernand.

51:06.000 --> 51:10.100
- You think he set up Mongkol?
- No, he'd be screwing himself.

51:10.300 --> 51:12.200
I'll see what I can do.

51:12.400 --> 51:15.600
- I'll meet you back here.
- Thank you, brother.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.300
You need anything?

51:21.500 --> 51:23.300
No.

51:24.300 --> 51:27.200
Is there any chance anybody
saw you go into the office?

51:27.300 --> 51:29.100
No.

51:29.500 --> 51:33.600
It's just... Just Jade.

51:35.500 --> 51:37.200
It was horrible.

51:37.900 --> 51:40.500
- There was blood everywhere.
- I'm sorry.

51:40.600 --> 51:42.600
It's my fault.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.600
She was so strong.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
It didn't matter what happened.
She...

51:53.500 --> 51:56.300
She never complained.

51:57.300 --> 51:59.300
And now they're gonna come
for me.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.800
No, you're with me.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.100
You don't have to worry.
You're with me.

52:05.700 --> 52:09.300
You're not always going to be here.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.100
Well, I might not always be here...

52:12.200 --> 52:16.800
...but you can be with me
as long as you want.

52:17.200 --> 52:19.000
Okay?

52:30.400 --> 52:32.500
Don't leave me.

52:33.400 --> 52:35.100
I won't.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.200
I'm sorry, sir.

53:52.300 --> 53:55.300
Leon had Hopper released.

54:18.400 --> 54:21.000
Things like that happen, captain.

54:23.200 --> 54:25.700
Hopper will have his day.

54:44.900 --> 54:47.200
Hold out the apple, captain.

54:49.100 --> 54:52.500
Sir, please, I can explain
what happened.

54:52.700 --> 54:54.400
Closer, captain.

54:56.100 --> 54:59.600
- There was nothing I could do.
- I said, closer.

55:01.900 --> 55:04.800
Closer to your head!

55:24.400 --> 55:27.900
If this happens again,
you will be the apple.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.200
Yes, sir.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.500
Fernand Zadir met with Hopper.

55:34.600 --> 55:36.700
Soon, Fitch will do the same.

55:36.900 --> 55:39.200
Silence them.

55:57.600 --> 56:01.900
Fernand uses this place when his
shipments come in from the river.

57:37.500 --> 57:40.200
Sunti, are you in the mood
for a dance?

59:10.700 --> 59:13.100
We were too late.
He was all we had.

59:13.300 --> 59:14.700
No, no, no.

59:15.200 --> 59:16.500
I don't think so.

59:16.700 --> 59:19.600
Sooner or later, they'll slip up,
and when they do...

59:19.800 --> 59:21.300
...we'll get what we want.

59:21.500 --> 59:24.400
- You think they'll come for you?
- I pray they come...

59:24.500 --> 59:27.500
...because then we'll find out
where my daughter is.

59:36.800 --> 59:39.100
No!

59:39.300 --> 59:41.700
No! Don't hurt me!

59:41.900 --> 59:44.700
- Get off me!
- Jess!

59:44.900 --> 59:48.900
This is a final warning. We will
execute them within 76 hours...

59:49.100 --> 59:53.000
...if our preliminary demands
are not met.

59:55.800 --> 59:55.900
- Where are we going?
- Fitch is all we've got.

59:55.900 --> 59:59.200
- Where are we going?
- Fitch is all we've got.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:05.600
What...? Is this woman cra...?

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.200
Wait here.

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.200
Is he gonna offer you a deal?

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.600
I don't think so.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.800
Then what does he want?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.600
I don't know and I don't care.

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.100
And what brings you to this part
of town, Mr. Hopper?

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.600
As you know,
I'm here to find my daughter.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.900
And I'm still looking for my money.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.200
I understand that,
but I can't help you.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:29.400
If I had your daughter,
you wouldn't be here.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.100
I believe you.

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:38.500
This may be a long shot, but who
was that woman at the train yard?

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.000
Why should I trust you?

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.900
Let me put it this way.
One of the kidnapped girls...

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.500
...is the daughter
of Senator John Winthorpe.

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:49.400
You do not want a bunch of these
black-op boys coming in here...

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.200
...and tearing up your world.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.000
Her name's Lena.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.700
She works for Bridgeport.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:03.900
It kind of seems to me
like maybe she's setting you up.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.500
I think you're right.

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.200
You know they're gonna
manipulate the CIA...

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.700
...into believing you're a threat.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.000
Thank you for saving my life.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:18.400
Nothing personal.
For me, it's all about the girls.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.500
I'm just here for those girls.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.700
Hey, buddy.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.300
- How you doing?
- Great. How are you?

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.900
You know, Fitch, you ain't nothing
but a trailer-park bitch.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.800
I think I figured it out. You lost out
on the heroin out of the north.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.400
It all went to the Chinese
in the triangle.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.400
You lost out on the Abu Karaf
in their arms dealing...

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.700
...because, hey, they're Muslims,
and after 9l11, well...

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:24.600
So you orchestrate the kidnapping
of two poor little innocent girls.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.100
Then you enlisted
Thai Special Forces and the CIA...

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:32.900
...to crush your business competition,
but you made one big mistake.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.700
You kidnapped my daughter.

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:39.600
You done? Good,
because I just wanna say, Jake...

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.000
...you're a fucking dog.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:43.700
You're gonna die right here...

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:47.100
...and your body's gonna rot
in a hole, just like Jessica's.

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.400
I suggest you put your gun down...

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.200
...and tell us where his daughter is,
okay?

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.800
The general's taking
really good care of her.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.200
What do you think of that?

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.600
Great. I like this one.

01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:06.100
I want him.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.400
Well, you're not my type, but, hey.

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.600
You enjoying this? Good...

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.500
...because it's the last thing
you're ever gonna see.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.300
I liked you much better as a bitch.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.500
Are you enjoying it?

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.900
Jake, this is between you and him.

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.100
Please don't kill him.

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.000
Jake, give me a break, huh?

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.400
For old times' sake.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.700
I'm just...
You know, I'm really confused.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.200
Didn't you just say I'm a dog
and I'm gonna die in this hole...

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.200
...just like my daughter?

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.500
Sunti, this is not a good man.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.300
What are we gonna do? It's not like
I can take him home to Mama.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.200
I guess he sealed his own fate.

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:27.000
It came from the president's office
10 minutes ago.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:36.000
Do you think we're doing
the right thing?

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:41.600
I don't think we have
any options, sir.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.200
What about the girls?

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:46.600
Senator Winthorpe wanted
more time...

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.399
...but the boss has made up
his mind.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.200
Hi, Shirley. Get me Leon.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.700
Yep.

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:06.000
Yes, I think it's for the best.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.200
I can have Colonel Rose mobile
in 12 hours.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:12.100
- Did you find Hopper yet?
- Still nothing, sir.

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:16.200
Listen, Hopper's a joke. A washed-up
old man. I'll take care of him.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:19.600
Sir, did you know a Fitch McQuoid?

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:21.600
Sure. He's retired, right?

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.600
He was found dead in his club
three hours ago.

01:09:26.899 --> 01:09:28.500
Stay in touch.

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:43.700
General, my people have decided
to move forward as planned.

01:09:43.899 --> 01:09:46.000
I understand.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.500
I'll let my officers know.

01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:52.000
You're doing the right thing, Leon.

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.400
Be careful.

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.100
I'll be fine.

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.500
Listen, I've been thinking.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.700
Not that anything would happen...

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:26.600
...but in the rare event
that I don't come back...

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:29.600
...this will be enough to tide
you over for a while.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:34.700
The phone number of my good friend
Tom Collins is in there. You call him.

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.500
All right?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.600
Keep it.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.300
I will be waiting for you
when you get back.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:10.300
- Time to go.
- All right.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.300
- You got both of those?
- Yep.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.700
- Yeah.
- Leon.

01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:30.200
How'd you get this number?

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.000
Abu Karaf don't have my daughter.
You know that.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.800
But Jantapan does,
and I think you know that.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.900
Going to get the girls. Thanks.

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:40.300
Wait a minute. Hopper.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.700
Shit.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.900
Clear.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Get us out of here!

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.100
Let us out! Please!

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:54.700
Stay here.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.300
You might defeat me...

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:26.600
...but you cannot defeat the magic.

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.800
It's okay. It's your father.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.800
You can come out now.

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.400
Hey, come here, baby.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:51.400
What'd you think,
I wasn't gonna come and get you?

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.200
Thank you.

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.200
Thank you.

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:13.300
- We did it, Jake.
- That we did.

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:21.000
Sunti.

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:27.200
See you next time, Jake.

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:48.500
Move in.

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:50.300
Go, go, go.

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:58.400
Wait, stop. Stop, all right?
Put your men at ease.

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:07.900
Goodbye, brother.
