Oh, okay. Oh, thank God.

38:47.727 --> 38:51.133
- We need to conserve our air.
- Okay. Okay.

38:51.231 --> 38:53.201
Oh, it's almost over.

38:56.036 --> 38:58.474
I was so frightened, Kate,
waiting for you.

38:58.571 --> 39:00.608
I thought that you were never coming back.

39:14.788 --> 39:17.293
I'm so sorry I got us into this.

39:35.208 --> 39:36.610
The other night at the hotel,

39:36.709 --> 39:38.712
what did you mean when you said
that your relationship

39:38.812 --> 39:40.782
was the only thing you were good at?

39:48.120 --> 39:51.227
You're always doing such fun stuff, Kate.

39:51.324 --> 39:54.095

doing crazy things,

39:54.193 --> 39:57.633

39:57.730 --> 40:00.836
I could never compete with that.

40:01.133 --> 40:04.640
I was always just
your boring older sister, but...

40:04.737 --> 40:07.476
my relationship with Stuart

40:07.574 --> 40:10.379
was the one thing I had that you didn't.

40:14.114 --> 40:16.786
We were never in competition.

40:20.185 --> 40:22.155
Maybe you weren't.

40:29.629 --> 40:32.568
What do you think Stuart would
say if he could see you now?

41:13.573 --> 41:15.476
Oh, my God, they've left us!

41:15.575 --> 41:16.877
They-they wouldn't have left us, okay?

41:17.177 --> 41:18.780
- Oh, God.
- Maybe it's something else.

41:18.878 --> 41:22.218
- Maybe it was a different boat.
- We would've heard it arrive.

41:22.315 --> 41:23.784
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

41:23.883 --> 41:26.488
I've got to go and try
and get them on the radio again.

41:26.586 --> 41:29.522
Kate, what are we gonna do
if they're not there?

41:29.622 --> 41:31.625

I thought it was gonna get me.

We're not safe here anymore.

43:18.531 --> 43:20.635
Did you make contact with Taylor?

They weren't there.

Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

43:25.938 --> 43:27.841
They're not just gonna leave us here.

43:27.940 --> 43:30.010
They said they were sending someone down.

43:30.311 --> 43:32.515
But we heard them leave, didn't we?

43:32.612 --> 43:34.415
They also said they were gonna
come down here

43:34.514 --> 43:36.918
and attach, like, a spare winch
to the top of the cage,

43:37.016 --> 43:39.354
but did you even see one
on the boat? I didn't...

43:39.452 --> 43:41.322
They are not gonna
leave us to die down here, okay?

43:41.421 --> 43:43.625
- You need to calm down.
- So we have to get back up to the top.

43:43.723 --> 43:45.460
No, Lisa, listen to me,
we cannot just swim up.

43:45.558 --> 43:46.793
- We can swim fast.
- No, we can't.

43:46.893 --> 43:48.028
- We can!
- We will get the bends.

43:48.329 --> 43:50.833
Do you know what the bends is?

43:50.930 --> 43:53.535
It's nitrogen bubbles in the brain.

43:53.633 --> 43:56.572
The only way to go up is to ascend slowly

We're not gonna die down here.
