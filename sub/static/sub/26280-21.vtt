WEBVTT

00:00.355 --> 00:01.787
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:01.950 --> 00:04.258
We conclusively proved
super-asymmetry,

00:04.259 --> 00:07.406
and yet somehow
we-we still feel like imposters.

00:07.407 --> 00:09.173
Yeah, there should be
a term for that.

00:09.242 --> 00:11.909
Oh, for crying out loud,
there is a term for that!

00:11.978 --> 00:14.011
It's called
"imposter syndrome,"

00:14.080 --> 00:16.079
and you don't have it,
because you can't have it

00:16.149 --> 00:18.349
if you are imposters,
and you are!

00:18.418 --> 00:21.285
We're the ones who discovered
super-asymmetry,

00:21.354 --> 00:23.674
so if anyone's gonna feel like
they have imposter syndrome,

00:23.723 --> 00:27.458
it's us because we're
not imposters, they are!

00:27.527 --> 00:30.461
You're imposters
and you're frauds!

00:33.466 --> 00:35.833
I think what President Siebert
is trying to say is that

00:35.902 --> 00:38.669
this is a setback and we should
adopt a different strategy.

00:38.738 --> 00:41.305
I-I'm sorry.
I-I just-- I-I snapped.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.941
Oh, you're sorry.
It's all better, then.

00:44.010 --> 00:46.777
Listen up, you have shot
to win a Nobel Prize,

00:46.846 --> 00:48.179
and you're blowing it.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.381
I think what President Siebert
is trying to say

00:50.450 --> 00:52.817
is that you have a shot
to win a Nobel Prize,

00:52.886 --> 00:55.419
and you're blowing it.

00:55.488 --> 00:58.856
Uh, that's exactly
what he said.

00:58.925 --> 01:02.160
Yes, but I said it
in my calming HR voice.

01:05.137 --> 01:07.114
So, obviously,

01:07.115 --> 01:09.315
I'm really sorry
about my outburst.

01:09.384 --> 01:11.584
Calling you frauds
was unacceptable.

01:11.653 --> 01:13.286
I feel terrible
about it.

01:13.355 --> 01:15.221
It has caused her
a lot of stress.

01:15.290 --> 01:16.723
She chewed through
her night guard

01:16.792 --> 01:19.492
like it was a
piece of jerky.

01:19.561 --> 01:21.394
What you said was
really hurtful,

01:21.463 --> 01:23.329
especially because I
thought we were friends.

01:23.398 --> 01:25.532
Why would you think that?

01:25.600 --> 01:28.535
Ouch.

01:28.603 --> 01:31.538
Ignore them;
they're just mean people.

01:31.606 --> 01:33.890
Uh, not mean, just sorry.

01:33.959 --> 01:37.210
Seem mean, are sorry.
Happens all the time.

01:37.279 --> 01:39.596
It's okay.
I talked to my therapist,

01:39.648 --> 01:41.581
and she made me realize
that what you said

01:41.650 --> 01:44.317
was really more about
your own insecurities.

01:46.254 --> 01:48.188
I'm sorry, what?

01:48.256 --> 01:50.623
There you go, she's sorry.
We all heard it. Moving on.

01:50.692 --> 01:52.625
Yes, obviously,

01:52.694 --> 01:54.627
you're angry at all
the attention we're getting

01:54.696 --> 01:56.629
for our discovery
and you're lashing out.

01:56.698 --> 01:59.499
Well, uh, technically,
<i>she</i> lashed out.

01:59.568 --> 02:01.801
<i>I</i> contained myself,
which I don't think

02:01.870 --> 02:04.070
I'm getting
enough credit for.

02:04.139 --> 02:06.439
The point is we should
take it as a compliment

02:06.508 --> 02:10.008
that even you guys think
we will win the Nobel Prize.

02:10.078 --> 02:13.279
Uh, no, we-we certainly
do not think that.

02:13.348 --> 02:14.814
The Nobel Committee
will realize

02:14.883 --> 02:16.416
that we came up
with this theory.

02:16.484 --> 02:17.484
But we proved it.

02:17.552 --> 02:18.651
By accident.

02:18.720 --> 02:21.254
All breakthroughs
happen by accident.

02:21.323 --> 02:23.990
No, they don't!

02:25.727 --> 02:27.388
Look, the Nobel Committee
doesn't like infighting,

02:27.412 --> 02:29.540
so if the four of you don't stop
sniping at each other,

02:29.564 --> 02:31.364
the award's gonna go
to someone else entirely.

02:31.433 --> 02:33.683
He's right.

02:33.752 --> 02:35.952
You know, like it or not,
we can't avoid each other.

02:36.021 --> 02:38.521
Let's at least
try to be civil.

02:38.590 --> 02:39.590
Agreed.

02:39.641 --> 02:41.407
You know, when you
think about it,

02:41.476 --> 02:45.184
we're linked together the
same way that super-asymmetry

02:45.185 --> 02:47.042
links together every atom
in the universe.

02:47.043 --> 02:48.560
Hmm.

02:48.561 --> 02:51.582
That's not
what it does at all!

02:52.040 --> 02:53.940
Well, that's the great thing
about science.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.609
We all get to have
our own opinions.

03:02.784 --> 03:04.149
I'm still not talking.

Well, I'm glad that
we hashed all that out,

03:42.326 --> 03:45.193
and moving forward,
may the best team win.

03:45.262 --> 03:46.728
I couldn't agree more.

03:46.797 --> 03:49.264
We're the best team.

03:49.333 --> 03:52.267
Greg Pemberton,
you old so-and-so.

03:52.336 --> 03:53.902
Very good to see you.

03:53.971 --> 03:56.371
Uh, let me introduce you
to my colleague, Dr. Campbell.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.685
Uh, Kevin, this is Barry Kripke.
We went to college together.

03:58.709 --> 04:01.376
Great to meet you.
Well, you have my number.

04:01.445 --> 04:03.445
We should hit up the
buffet at the strip club

04:03.513 --> 04:04.980
while you're in town.

04:05.048 --> 04:07.749
Nothing beats a lap dance
and a baked potato bar, huh?

04:09.086 --> 04:10.385
You can come, too.

04:10.454 --> 04:12.454
That's a hard pass.

04:12.522 --> 04:14.823
I'll walk you out.

04:14.891 --> 04:16.858
Good to see you, Barry.

04:16.927 --> 04:19.160
You're the best!

04:19.228 --> 04:20.678
Oh...

04:20.747 --> 04:23.114
God, I hate that guy.

04:23.183 --> 04:26.318
That's strange; you
seem quite fond of him.

04:26.386 --> 04:29.854
I was only being polite.
Pemberton is a grade A weasel.

04:29.923 --> 04:31.756
How do I know you're
not just being polite

04:31.825 --> 04:33.391
when you say it's
nice to see me?

04:33.460 --> 04:36.761
I have literally
never said that to you.

04:38.031 --> 04:40.432
Why do you say he's a weasel?

04:40.500 --> 04:42.634
Pemberton's whole M.O.

04:42.703 --> 04:45.503
was to take other people's ideas
and turn them in as his own.

04:45.572 --> 04:47.639
That's exactly what
he's doing to us.

04:47.708 --> 04:50.508
I'm not surprised. I heard the
only work he did on his thesis

04:50.577 --> 04:53.812
was googling,
"Where can I buy a thesis?"

04:53.880 --> 04:57.916
Well, plagiarism is a pretty
serious charge. Are you sure?

04:57.985 --> 05:00.352
You want proof?
I can make some calls.

05:00.420 --> 05:02.187
You'd do that for us?

05:02.255 --> 05:04.402
I really don't want to see
that guy win a Nobel.

05:04.403 --> 05:06.570
I also don't want
to see you win a Nobel.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.405
Ooh, this is tricky.

05:10.242 --> 05:12.743
I don't know, Barry.
It sounds a little sleazy.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.746
Well, let me know
if you change your mind.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.582
Sleazy is where I thrive.

05:22.728 --> 05:24.762
So I was talking
to my mom

05:24.830 --> 05:26.286
about our Pemberton
and Campbell situation.

05:26.287 --> 05:27.238
Really? What'd she say?

05:27.262 --> 05:29.832
Apparently, Old Testament God
would bring down his wrath

05:29.833 --> 05:31.408
on them for being deceitful,

05:31.409 --> 05:33.647
but New Testament God
would forgive them.

05:36.067 --> 05:38.362
So couldn't we just
bring down our wrath

05:38.363 --> 05:40.584
and ask the New Testament God
to forgive us?

05:40.585 --> 05:42.637
You know, I asked her
that very question.

05:42.661 --> 05:43.182
And?

05:43.183 --> 05:46.200
She said I was full
of California sass.

05:47.036 --> 05:49.437
Oh, good, you're all here.
Uh, we're wrestling

05:49.506 --> 05:51.806
with an ethical question,
and perhaps you could help.

05:51.875 --> 05:53.441
- Sure, what's up? - Yeah.
- Fire away.

05:53.510 --> 05:55.943
If we have damaging
and embarrassing information

05:56.012 --> 05:59.680
about someone, should we keep it
to ourselves or expose them?

06:03.820 --> 06:05.972
Quick question: Does it happen
to do with online tastes

06:05.996 --> 06:08.156
that might or might not reflect
their real-life tastes?

06:10.344 --> 06:12.261
I know all about your
tall girl website.

06:12.262 --> 06:13.961
It goes on our
credit card.

06:16.282 --> 06:18.499
It's Dr. Pemberton.

06:18.568 --> 06:20.635
Kripke says
he plagiarized his thesis,

06:20.703 --> 06:22.220
and that he can prove it.

06:22.288 --> 06:25.640
Wow. Well, that's not gonna sit
well with the Nobel Committee.

06:25.708 --> 06:27.708
Hang on. I don't think
it's fair to use something

06:27.777 --> 06:30.211
someone did in school
against them.

06:30.280 --> 06:33.381
Relax, he said
it's not you.

06:33.449 --> 06:35.349
I don't know.
If someone's a cheater,

06:35.418 --> 06:38.252
they should be held accountable
no matter how long ago it was.

06:38.321 --> 06:42.156
Okay, now
you just sound crazy.

06:42.225 --> 06:44.258
So you really think
they should do this?

06:44.327 --> 06:46.494
It wouldn't
just knock Pemberton

06:46.563 --> 06:49.497
out of Nobel contention, it
would blow up his whole career.

06:49.566 --> 06:51.899
To that, I say kaboom!

06:53.570 --> 06:56.170
No, I meant
it's a bad thing.

06:56.239 --> 06:57.605
No, no, I agree
with Bernadette.

06:57.674 --> 06:58.906
If Pemberton cheated,

06:58.975 --> 07:01.015
maybe he shouldn't have a career
in the first place.

07:01.044 --> 07:02.922
There's plenty of people
that didn't plagiarize.

07:02.946 --> 07:05.146
And a few of us who did,
but it's only 'cause

07:05.215 --> 07:07.148
<i>The Scarlet Letter</i>
was so boring.

07:09.085 --> 07:11.252
Aw, I love
<i>The Scarlet Letter.</i>

07:11.321 --> 07:14.021
Th-That's where I got
my taste for bad girls.

07:15.758 --> 07:20.328
Ugh, why is this
decision so hard?

07:20.396 --> 07:21.996
Maybe because
you want to win,

07:22.065 --> 07:24.732
but deep down you know it's not
the honorable way to do it.

07:24.801 --> 07:26.312
Otherwise, you would've
done it already.

07:26.336 --> 07:27.969
That's really wise.

07:28.037 --> 07:31.872
Yes, but it may just be
the Indian accent.

07:35.778 --> 07:38.212
Do you think
by not exposing Pemberton

07:38.248 --> 07:40.548
we're doing
the right thing?

07:40.617 --> 07:42.183
Of course.

07:42.252 --> 07:45.453
Unless you think we're not
doing the right thing.

07:45.521 --> 07:47.288
Why would you think
that I don't think

07:47.357 --> 07:48.623
we're doing the right thing?

07:48.691 --> 07:52.293
You might think that if
good people hold themselves

07:52.362 --> 07:54.295
to unrealistically high
ethical standards,

07:54.364 --> 07:57.365
then they might lose out to
their unscrupulous competitors.

07:57.433 --> 07:58.532
Is that what you think?

07:58.601 --> 07:59.800
No.

07:59.869 --> 08:01.636
No, I just thought
if you thought we weren't

08:01.704 --> 08:04.572
doing the right thing,
that's why you might think that.

08:04.641 --> 08:06.841
Well, if I did think that,

08:06.909 --> 08:09.176
you might point out
that people who claim

08:09.245 --> 08:11.612
it's okay to do
bad things to win

08:11.681 --> 08:14.248
are bad people no matter
what they tell themselves.

08:14.317 --> 08:15.983
And I'd be right

08:16.052 --> 08:17.251
to point that out.

08:17.320 --> 08:18.986
Because you're a good person.

08:20.823 --> 08:23.391
I love talking
to you.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.926
It's like talking to me,
but with a girl voice.

08:29.365 --> 08:32.265
I'm just saying, Sheldon
and Amy deserve to win,

08:32.335 --> 08:34.501
and sometimes that means
doing what you got to do.

08:34.570 --> 08:37.203
Don't you think it's better
to take the high road?

08:37.273 --> 08:38.572
Yeah, and instead of guns,

08:38.640 --> 08:42.809
armies should carry
candy canes that shoot wishes.

08:42.879 --> 08:44.490
So what's the worst thing
you've ever done

08:44.514 --> 08:46.063
to get something
you wanted?

08:46.132 --> 08:47.665
I'm not gonna
tell you that.

08:47.734 --> 08:50.051
Oh, come on.
I'll tell you mine.

08:50.119 --> 08:52.820
Right,
'cause yours is gonna be

08:52.889 --> 08:55.423
as bad as mine. Okay.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.925
Come on, just tell me.

08:57.994 --> 08:59.860
Okay, fine.

08:59.929 --> 09:02.296
When we first met,
there was another waitress

09:02.365 --> 09:04.376
at The Cheesecake Factory
who thought you were cute,

09:04.400 --> 09:09.170
so I told her you had all
the hepatitises, A through Z.

09:09.238 --> 09:11.806
There aren't
26 hepatitises.

09:11.874 --> 09:13.674
Well, if she was smart
enough to know that,

09:13.743 --> 09:16.077
she wouldn't still be working
at a Cheesecake Factory.

09:16.145 --> 09:17.878
Oh, she still works there?
Who was it?

09:17.947 --> 09:19.413
Why does it matter?

09:19.482 --> 09:23.417
You're right, it doesn't matter
'cause I got the best one.

09:25.288 --> 09:26.954
Was it Susan?

09:27.023 --> 09:28.389
Why? Because she's tall?

09:28.458 --> 09:30.591
Good night.

09:31.994 --> 09:34.128
Can't believe it.

09:34.197 --> 09:36.630
Sheldon loves telling on people
when they break the rules.

09:36.699 --> 09:38.733
Yeah, well, maybe he's changed.

09:38.801 --> 09:40.846
He hasn't changed. Last week,
when the vending machine

09:40.870 --> 09:43.971
gave me two bags of chips,
he called my mom.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.873
Well, that didn't
ruin your life.

09:45.942 --> 09:47.141
Well, it ruined my day.

09:47.210 --> 09:49.944
I had to talk to my mom,
who, by the way,

09:50.012 --> 09:54.482
is-is polyamorous now,
so that's fun to think about.

09:54.550 --> 09:56.617
Look, I'm proud
of Sheldon and Amy.

09:56.686 --> 09:58.931
You know? They want to win
this thing on their own merits,

09:58.955 --> 10:00.988
not by knocking out
the competition.

10:01.057 --> 10:02.456
Yeah, but what if
they don't win?

10:02.525 --> 10:04.625
Uh, Pemberton and Campbell
have done an amazing job

10:04.694 --> 10:06.794
of associating their names
with super-asymmetry.

10:06.863 --> 10:08.896
They have all
the momentum right now.

10:08.965 --> 10:10.609
I don't like the idea
of them losing either,

10:10.633 --> 10:13.167
but this is their decision
to make, not ours.

10:14.670 --> 10:16.203
Maybe it is ours.

10:16.272 --> 10:17.705
What do you mean?

10:17.774 --> 10:20.875
Well, i-if Sheldon and Amy
don't want to expose Pemberton,

10:20.943 --> 10:23.411
that doesn't mean someone else
can't do it for them.

10:23.479 --> 10:25.146
They'd never have to know.

10:25.214 --> 10:27.014
Really? You'd do that?

10:27.083 --> 10:28.349
They deserve the Nobel.

10:28.418 --> 10:30.851
I'm not gonna let two frauds
steal it from them.

10:30.920 --> 10:33.554
And if that means getting
my hands dirty, so be it.

10:33.623 --> 10:36.957
What's so funny?

10:37.026 --> 10:41.529
Just realized I've never
actually seen your hands dirty.

10:43.049 --> 10:45.983
All right, Hofstadter, here's
all the proof you need.

10:46.052 --> 10:47.818
- Great, thanks.
- Just remember,

10:47.887 --> 10:51.605
once you take this envelope,
there's no turning back.

10:51.674 --> 10:54.275
What if I look at it
and decide not to use it?

10:57.847 --> 10:59.780
I had not considered that.

11:00.883 --> 11:02.082
Got to hand it to you,

11:02.151 --> 11:03.962
you got a real talent
for making things boring.

11:03.986 --> 11:05.986
Thanks.

11:06.055 --> 11:08.189
Hey, look at that,
you did it again.

11:10.326 --> 11:11.459
Hi, Leonard.

11:11.527 --> 11:13.294
What? Nothing.

11:13.362 --> 11:15.196
You okay?

11:15.264 --> 11:16.564
Uh, no, you are.

11:22.994 --> 11:25.462
So guess what.
There was a waitress

11:25.463 --> 11:27.396
at The Cheesecake Factory
back in the day

11:27.465 --> 11:29.498
who kind of had a thing for me.

11:29.567 --> 11:33.135
Other than Bernadette?
That does not sound right.

11:33.204 --> 11:34.570
Honest to God.

11:34.639 --> 11:35.971
Oh, well, who was it?

11:36.040 --> 11:37.518
It doesn't even matter.
I'm happily married.

11:37.542 --> 11:40.976
The point is women-- plural--
find me appealing.

11:41.045 --> 11:43.479
Okay. Okay, well,
well, let's see.

11:43.548 --> 11:45.648
Okay? We-we know
it wasn't Penny,

11:45.717 --> 11:47.983
we know it wasn't Susan...
- Wait.

11:48.052 --> 11:49.385
How do we know it wasn't Susan?

11:49.454 --> 11:51.153
Uh, because she had a type.

11:51.222 --> 11:52.421
What type?

11:52.490 --> 11:55.257
Don't make me say it.

11:55.326 --> 11:58.260
Are you saying
I'm not a handsome guy?

11:58.329 --> 12:01.030
See? It's mean, right?

12:03.401 --> 12:05.334
Hold on, as we've established,

12:05.403 --> 12:08.037
a minimum of two women
think I'm attractive.

12:08.106 --> 12:11.207
Uh, yeah, you're right,
it was totally Susan.

12:11.275 --> 12:14.076
I didn't say it was her.
I said it could've been.

12:14.145 --> 12:17.279
It could've been anybody.
Marta, Gina, Annalise...

12:17.348 --> 12:20.850
It's a little creepy that
you remember all their names.

12:20.918 --> 12:22.351
Not just their names.

12:22.420 --> 12:24.453
The cars they drove,
the color of their eyes,

12:24.522 --> 12:26.555
and whether or not
they had boyfriends.

12:29.293 --> 12:31.560
Your husband was acting
kind of weird today.

12:31.629 --> 12:34.930
You sure you're not thinking
about <i>your</i> husband?

12:34.966 --> 12:37.533
No. He was acting all sketchy.

12:37.602 --> 12:39.401
Almost like he was guilty
or something.

12:39.437 --> 12:40.877
Oh. Well,
that doesn't mean anything.

12:40.938 --> 12:43.873
I mean, Leonard has
resting guilt face.

12:43.941 --> 12:45.919
Yeah, it's-it's like, "What are
you guilty about, Leonard?"

12:45.943 --> 12:48.444
"Nothing." "Well, then,
tell it to your face."

12:48.513 --> 12:50.579
Are you okay?

12:50.648 --> 12:52.381
I'm so okay, yeah.

12:52.450 --> 12:54.617
Then why are <i>you</i>
acting guilty now?

12:55.720 --> 12:57.520
Okay, look, Leonard knows

12:57.588 --> 12:59.989
that you and Sheldon
decided to take the high road,

13:00.057 --> 13:01.457
so he went to
Kripke for you.

13:01.526 --> 13:03.459
But that just means you
didn't do anything wrong,

13:03.528 --> 13:05.328
and now you don't risk
losing to those idiots.

13:05.396 --> 13:07.229
Why did you tell me?

13:07.298 --> 13:09.598
Now that I know, I'm implicated.

13:09.667 --> 13:10.833
But you wanted me to.

13:10.902 --> 13:13.002
I also wanted you
to be my jester

13:13.070 --> 13:15.471
at the Renaissance Fair,
but that didn't happen.

13:15.540 --> 13:18.007
I wanted to be a princess.

13:18.075 --> 13:21.410
There was only one princess,
and it was me!

13:21.479 --> 13:24.580
Fine. I'm sorry I told you.

13:24.649 --> 13:26.549
And I forgive you.

13:26.617 --> 13:29.385
'Cause that's what
a princess would do.

13:30.822 --> 13:32.922
Kudos on the meatballs.

13:32.990 --> 13:34.924
They're nice and round.

13:36.727 --> 13:38.194
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

13:38.262 --> 13:40.196
They're much better
than those prolate spheroids

13:40.264 --> 13:42.698
you used to pass off as balls.

13:42.767 --> 13:44.433
Okay.

13:44.502 --> 13:47.303
Are you all right?
You seem distracted.

13:47.371 --> 13:50.940
Yeah, sorry. I'm just trying
to figure something out.

13:51.008 --> 13:52.808
Is it what to get me
for our anniversary?

13:52.877 --> 13:54.477
'Cause I'll give you
a hint: it's already

13:54.545 --> 13:57.980
in my Amazon basket.
Just click "buy now."

13:59.183 --> 14:00.549
I filled out
the gift card for you.

14:00.618 --> 14:03.786
Apparently,
I'm the light of your life.

14:03.855 --> 14:07.623
Sheldon, if someone
were gonna do something

14:07.692 --> 14:09.859
ethically murky on your behalf,

14:09.927 --> 14:11.694
would you rather
know about it

14:11.762 --> 14:14.997
or not know about it
to retain your innocence?

14:15.066 --> 14:19.134
Well, now that I know there's
a thing to know, I have to know.

14:19.203 --> 14:21.804
Can't help myself;
I'm a fact addict.

14:21.873 --> 14:23.539
That's not a real thing.

14:23.608 --> 14:25.774
And that's a fact.

14:27.144 --> 14:30.312
Leonard, I know
what you're planning to do,

14:30.381 --> 14:31.625
and I said
I didn't want to do it.

14:31.649 --> 14:32.815
What? You told him?

14:32.884 --> 14:34.250
Well, you told me.

14:34.318 --> 14:36.819
Yeah, that's-that's
probably where you heard it.

14:37.989 --> 14:39.588
You're not
doing anything wrong.

14:39.657 --> 14:41.357
That's the point.
I'm doing it.

14:41.425 --> 14:43.158
Yeah, but it's still wrong.

14:43.227 --> 14:44.894
Well, so is
you and Amy not getting

14:44.962 --> 14:46.328
the recognition
for your discovery.

14:46.397 --> 14:48.497
And if that means
I have to do something shady

14:48.566 --> 14:50.766
so you don't have to,
I'm okay with that.

14:50.835 --> 14:52.301
But we're not.

14:52.370 --> 14:55.204
I mean, it's sweet that you want
to help, but we don't want you

14:55.273 --> 14:57.373
compromising your integrity
for us.

14:57.441 --> 14:59.875
Wait, what-- really?

14:59.944 --> 15:02.211
I thought we were just
worried about looking bad.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.346
It could be both.

15:04.415 --> 15:06.015
Okay.

15:06.083 --> 15:09.151
But I'm gonna go with my reason.
Yours is too complicated.

15:12.757 --> 15:14.223
Hey.

15:14.292 --> 15:15.524
Hey.

15:15.593 --> 15:19.128
Listen, I did something
kind of stupid today.

15:19.196 --> 15:21.397
Okay.

15:21.465 --> 15:23.065
I went to The Cheesecake Factory

15:23.134 --> 15:26.435
to try to figure out
who that waitress was.

15:26.504 --> 15:28.437
- Howie.
- Don't worry, I didn't find out,

15:28.506 --> 15:31.373
because I realized
I didn't even care.

15:31.442 --> 15:33.976
W-While I was there,
I started asking myself,

15:34.045 --> 15:35.878
"Why does this mean
anything to me?"

15:35.947 --> 15:41.617
And... I guess the truth is
it was all about my vanity.

15:41.686 --> 15:45.554
And why should I need to be
validated by another woman

15:45.623 --> 15:50.693
liking me when the best woman
in the world already loves me?

15:52.129 --> 15:54.630
And I just wanted
you to know that.

15:56.367 --> 15:57.847
The restaurant manager
already called.

15:57.902 --> 15:59.702
You really creeped
a lot of people out.

16:01.405 --> 16:04.940
And I regret that.

16:05.009 --> 16:07.710
Because the only woman
I want to creep out

16:07.778 --> 16:09.545
is the mother
of my children.

16:11.949 --> 16:14.583
Well, you're off
to a good start.

16:18.689 --> 16:20.522
Thank you for meeting us.

16:20.591 --> 16:21.690
No problem.

16:21.759 --> 16:23.704
We never say no when someone
wants to buy us lunch.

16:23.728 --> 16:26.195
We didn't say we were
going to buy you lunch.

16:26.263 --> 16:28.197
Really? Apologies go down easier

16:28.265 --> 16:30.499
with free
turkey club sandwiches.

16:31.602 --> 16:34.470
This isn't another apology.

16:34.538 --> 16:35.983
There's something
we have to give you.

16:36.007 --> 16:37.606
Yes.

16:37.675 --> 16:41.977
Uh, we have proof that you
plagiarized your thesis.

16:42.046 --> 16:44.480
It's why we invited you
to this lunch.

16:44.548 --> 16:45.981
We invited them.

16:46.050 --> 16:49.551
That's the confusion
over who's paying.

16:49.620 --> 16:51.520
Hold on, are you
blackmailing us?

16:51.589 --> 16:53.255
No, the opposite.

16:54.358 --> 16:56.358
We're blackmailing you?

16:59.530 --> 17:01.797
How are you
up for a Nobel?!

17:01.866 --> 17:03.665
We're giving you this

17:03.734 --> 17:05.834
so that no one can
use it against you,

17:05.903 --> 17:08.337
because we want to win
on our own merits,

17:08.406 --> 17:10.138
not by tearing you down.

17:10.207 --> 17:12.473
So it's true?
You really did this?

17:12.542 --> 17:13.854
It was years ago, and
I was going through

17:13.877 --> 17:15.810
a very hard time.
- What hard time?

17:15.880 --> 17:18.847
I had to write a thesis, and
I wasn't smart enough to do it.

17:20.984 --> 17:23.285
You realize my name
is attached to yours.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.253
If this gets out,
it ruins me, too.

17:25.321 --> 17:27.021
It's not gonna get out.

17:27.090 --> 17:28.435
You know what?
Linda was right.

17:28.459 --> 17:29.992
You're always
looking for shortcuts.

17:30.061 --> 17:33.028
When did you talk
to my ex-wife?

17:33.097 --> 17:34.097
She's not your ex-wife.

17:34.165 --> 17:35.442
You keep dragging your feet
on those papers.

17:35.466 --> 17:38.434
Well, I'm trying to
get the lake house.

17:38.502 --> 17:39.713
You're not getting
the lake house.

17:39.737 --> 17:41.670
You're never
getting the lake house.

17:41.739 --> 17:43.139
She picked it out,
she decorated it.

17:43.207 --> 17:44.740
The lake house is hers.

17:44.809 --> 17:46.508
What is going on here?

17:46.577 --> 17:48.877
I'm in love with Linda!

17:51.015 --> 17:53.549
You son of a bitch!

17:55.000 --> 18:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here

18:02.593 --> 18:05.027
That was my iced tea.

18:09.929 --> 18:11.729
Dr. Cooper, Dr. Fowler.

18:11.798 --> 18:13.798
Just the guy I want to see.

18:15.032 --> 18:16.389
Are you drunk?

18:16.390 --> 18:19.291
I was, and then I still was.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.094
And now, I still was.

18:22.162 --> 18:24.830
Okay, can we help you?

18:24.898 --> 18:26.798
Pemberton is out.

18:26.867 --> 18:28.333
Someone published
all the information

18:28.402 --> 18:29.835
about his plagiarism.

18:29.903 --> 18:31.303
It was me.

18:32.911 --> 18:36.200
Someone else told Fermilab,
and he lost his job.

18:36.201 --> 18:37.634
Also me.

18:38.346 --> 18:39.243
And someone is

18:39.244 --> 18:43.212
sleeping with his ex-wife
and it's not me.

18:43.281 --> 18:45.481
I thought it was.

18:45.550 --> 18:48.017
Not anymore. Apparently,
just because I'm better

18:48.086 --> 18:51.153
than her husband doesn't mean
I'm as good as her contractor.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.024
Women, huh?

18:55.093 --> 18:56.492
I-I think you
need to go.

18:56.561 --> 18:58.561
No, wait.
Hear me out.

18:58.630 --> 19:00.229
Look, the three of us
could team up.

19:00.298 --> 19:01.364
There's one
small catch.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.132
Dr. Pemberton
has been saying

19:03.201 --> 19:04.934
a lot of bad stuff about me.

19:05.003 --> 19:07.470
But don't worry, I couldn't
possibly have done any of it,

19:07.505 --> 19:09.538
because I was with you guys
the whole time.

19:09.607 --> 19:10.873
I did it.

19:14.579 --> 19:16.278
Frankly,
I don't know what Linda

19:16.347 --> 19:17.813
ever saw in either of them.
