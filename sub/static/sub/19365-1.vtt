01:26.228 --> 01:28.106
Santa's been!

01:43.533 --> 01:46.368
<i>Stick Man lives in the family tree...</i>

01:47.567 --> 01:49.973
<i>...with his Stick Lady Love...</i>

01:50.053 --> 01:52.791
<i>...and their stick children three.</i>

02:33.500 --> 02:34.501
Sorry.

03:37.367 --> 03:40.097
<i>One day, he wakes early and goes for a jog.</i>

03:40.200 --> 03:41.770
Hello!

03:57.600 --> 03:59.417
There you go.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.926
Stick Man!

04:10.203 --> 04:13.400
Stick Man! Beware of the...

04:16.225 --> 04:17.822
...dog!

04:20.867 --> 04:23.608
- A stick?
- Barks the dog.

04:23.967 --> 04:26.727
An excellent stick!

04:29.450 --> 04:32.051
The right kind of stick
for my favorite trick!

04:39.033 --> 04:41.904
I'll fetch it and drop it
and fetch it and then...

04:42.384 --> 04:45.197
...I'll drop it and fetch it
and drop it again!

05:00.467 --> 05:02.227
Come on.

05:15.633 --> 05:19.173
I'm not a stick. Why can't you see?

05:20.067 --> 05:22.020
- I'm Stick Man.
- Yeah?

05:22.100 --> 05:25.570
- I'm Stick Man.
- Yeah?

05:25.650 --> 05:27.533
That's me.

05:31.267 --> 05:34.127
And I want to go home to the family tree.

05:41.133 --> 05:45.103
- <i>A notice says...</i>
- Dogs must be kept on the lead.

05:49.967 --> 05:53.827
<i>At last, the game's over
and Stick Man is freed.</i>

06:03.467 --> 06:07.097
<i>He sets off for home with a hop and a twirl.</i>

06:10.130 --> 06:11.715
Stick Man!

06:11.795 --> 06:13.867
Stick Man! Beware of the girl!

06:18.267 --> 06:22.103
- A stick!
- <i>Cries the girl, with a smile on her face.</i>

06:22.900 --> 06:25.520
The right kind of pooh stick
for winning the race!

06:37.100 --> 06:40.530
- Has everyone got one?
- Get ready to play!

06:40.633 --> 06:42.573
- It's one...
- Two, three.

06:42.667 --> 06:45.995
- Into the river they... go!
- Go!

07:05.927 --> 07:07.566
Yes!

07:11.533 --> 07:14.770
I'm not a pooh stick. Why can't they see?

07:15.067 --> 07:16.927
I'm Stick Man.

07:17.033 --> 07:20.870
I'm Stick Man. I'm Stick Man.

07:23.733 --> 07:26.489
That's... me.

07:45.333 --> 07:49.103
And I'm heading away from the family tree.

07:51.833 --> 07:55.421
<i>Stick Man is swimming. He swims on and on.</i>

08:01.633 --> 08:03.203
Cool.

08:12.433 --> 08:14.103
All right.

08:22.167 --> 08:23.737
Bye.

08:28.997 --> 08:30.673
Ribbit!

08:33.299 --> 08:35.773
Thanks. Bye.

08:38.667 --> 08:39.727
What?

08:40.033 --> 08:43.803
- Stick Man! Stick Man!
- Hello.

08:43.900 --> 08:46.330
Beware of the swan!

08:52.633 --> 08:55.149
- A twig!
- <i>Says the swan.</i>

08:55.233 --> 08:57.503
This twig is the best.

09:03.533 --> 09:06.673
It's the right kind of twig
to weave into my nest.

09:09.609 --> 09:12.483
I'm not a twig. Why can't they see...

09:13.633 --> 09:15.403
I'm Stick Man!

09:15.500 --> 09:18.103
Stick... Man!

09:18.183 --> 09:20.664
I'm Stick Man!

09:24.200 --> 09:26.270
That's me!

10:41.533 --> 10:45.463
I'm not a twig. Why can't they see?

10:49.600 --> 10:51.430
I'm Stick Man.

10:53.133 --> 10:55.179
I'm Stick Man.

10:55.967 --> 10:59.127
I'm Stick Man. That's me.

11:10.267 --> 11:13.326
And I long to be back in the family tree.

11:32.617 --> 11:36.808
<i>The nest is deserted and Stick Man is free.</i>

11:44.567 --> 11:46.897
<i>He drifts down the river...</i>

11:50.300 --> 11:52.511
<i>...and sails out to sea.</i>

13:29.200 --> 13:32.281
<i>He tosses and turns,
till the frolicking foam...</i>

13:32.367 --> 13:34.747
<i>...washes him up on a beach...</i>

13:34.827 --> 13:36.993
<i>...far from home.</i>

14:18.200 --> 14:21.681
- Here comes our dad!
- With a spade in his hand!

14:26.633 --> 14:29.384
Stick Man? Stick Man!

14:29.467 --> 14:31.338
Beware of the sand!

14:35.567 --> 14:38.083
- A mast!
- <i>Yells the dad.</i>

14:38.163 --> 14:40.411
An excellent mast!

14:42.504 --> 14:45.281
There's a flag on our castle at last!

14:57.733 --> 14:59.284
Hey!

15:06.567 --> 15:10.378
I'm not a mast forever! Silly old flag!

15:17.400 --> 15:19.441
Or a sword for a knight.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.441
Or a hook for a bag.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.681
I'm not a pen.

15:37.567 --> 15:39.778
I'm not a bow.

15:42.017 --> 15:44.058
I'm not a bat.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.641
Or a boomerang!

15:54.117 --> 15:55.678
No!

15:57.833 --> 16:00.844
- I'm...
- Stick Man! Stick Man!

16:00.933 --> 16:02.984
Beware of the...

16:05.533 --> 16:07.144
...snow.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.211
<i>Here comes a boy in a warm woolly scarf.</i>

16:12.300 --> 16:14.581
An arm for my snowman!

16:14.667 --> 16:16.678
<i>He says with a laugh.</i>

16:24.733 --> 16:27.384
I'm not an arm.

16:27.867 --> 16:30.138
Can nobody see?

16:35.067 --> 16:37.238
I'm Stick Man.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.581
I'm Stick Man.

16:44.917 --> 16:47.358
I'm Stick Man.

16:47.933 --> 16:49.814
That's me.

16:56.033 --> 16:58.944
Will I ever get back to the...

17:01.200 --> 17:03.441
...family tree?

17:59.833 --> 18:01.484
<i>Stick Man is lonely.</i>

18:02.367 --> 18:04.478
<i>Stick Man is lost.</i>

18:05.517 --> 18:09.158
<i>Stick Man is frozen and covered in frost.</i>

18:18.667 --> 18:20.708
<i>Stick Man is weary.</i>

18:21.433 --> 18:23.714
<i>His eyes start to close.</i>

18:26.867 --> 18:30.608
<i>He stretches and yawns
and lies down for a doze.</i>

18:33.967 --> 18:38.338
<i>He can't hear the bells
or the sweet-singing choir...</i>

18:43.600 --> 18:47.778
- <i>...or the voice saying...</i>
- Here's a good stick for the fire.

19:00.750 --> 19:03.831
<i>Stick Man is lying asleep in the grate.</i>

19:05.633 --> 19:08.984
<i>Can anyone wake him before it's too late?</i>

19:24.333 --> 19:28.544
<i>He dreams of his kids
and his Stick Lady love...</i>

20:10.067 --> 20:11.978
<i>...then suddenly awakes.</i>

20:21.900 --> 20:24.341
What's that noise up above?

20:25.233 --> 20:28.484
<i>It starts as a chuckle then turns to a shout.</i>

20:30.745 --> 20:33.788
I'm stuck. Get me out.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.608
A stuck man?

20:44.367 --> 20:46.588
A stuck man.

20:46.983 --> 20:49.334
Now, who could that be?

20:50.167 --> 20:52.578
- Don't worry!
- <i>Cries Stick Man.</i>

20:52.667 --> 20:54.908
I'll soon set you free!

21:00.400 --> 21:02.911
<i>A scratch and a scrape...</i>

21:03.000 --> 21:05.711
<i>...and a flurry of soot...</i>

21:06.100 --> 21:10.978
<i>...a wiggle, a jiggle, and out pokes a foot.</i>

21:12.567 --> 21:15.578
<i>A shove and a nudge, a hop and a jump...</i>

21:20.633 --> 21:24.084
<i>...and Santa falls
into the room with a thump.</i>

21:37.183 --> 21:38.584
Stick Man?

21:44.000 --> 21:47.381
Stick Man! You excellent friend!

21:49.533 --> 21:52.114
Thanks! Thanks a million!

21:52.200 --> 21:54.201
Thanks without end!

23:35.683 --> 23:38.964
<i>Then Stick Man helped Santa
deliver the toys...</i>

23:41.667 --> 23:43.958
<i>...to fast-asleep girls...</i>

23:44.450 --> 23:46.703
<i>...and to fast-asleep boys.</i>

23:51.100 --> 23:53.111
There you go.

23:58.833 --> 24:01.844
<i>Faster and faster
they fly through the snow...</i>

24:05.350 --> 24:09.691
- <i>...until Santa says...</i>
- Only one chimney to go.

24:24.100 --> 24:27.921
<i>Stick Lady's lonely. The children are sad.</i>

24:31.000 --> 24:34.381
<i>It won't feel like Christmas
without their stick dad.</i>

24:36.767 --> 24:39.708
<i>They toss and they turn in the family bed.</i>

24:49.067 --> 24:50.578
<i>But...</i>

24:51.917 --> 24:54.528
What is that clattering sound overhead?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.811
Someone is tumbling into our house.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.841
- Is it a bird?
- Or a bat?

25:04.117 --> 25:06.558
Or a mouse?

25:13.200 --> 25:15.381
Or could it...

25:15.467 --> 25:18.468
Yes. Could it just possibly be...

25:24.167 --> 25:25.858
I'm Stick Man.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.241
I'm Stick Man.

25:28.333 --> 25:30.414
I'm Stick Man.

25:33.667 --> 25:35.515
That's me.

25:36.400 --> 25:40.941
And I'm sticking right here
in the family tree.
