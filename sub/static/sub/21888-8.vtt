if I breastfeed in here?

She's so fertile.
She's got one on the way.

00:33.117 --> 00:34.535
That's so weird.

00:34.577 --> 00:36.203
I didn't know that you could
actually, like, breastfeed

00:36.245 --> 00:37.538
and get pregnant
at the same time.

Hey, Moshe?

I'm-I'm not gonna come back to
Israel, I don't think, so, uh--

there's not a 15-hour flight

-Mm.

There was nobod--
there was no... nobody around

how to be a man, you know.

a father in your life,

05:00.634 --> 05:02.052
well, not Haim,

but if you had a real father
in your life,

05:05.764 --> 05:07.808
maybe you wouldn't have
turned out, you know...

05:10.019 --> 05:11.270
...the way you did.

I don't know,
I don't know what...

05:57.483 --> 05:58.692
It is to scare people off.

Who knows anybody anyway?

06:53.330 --> 06:54.665
Well...

06:54.706 --> 06:57.376
Well, we know each other.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.586
I don't know if we do, Shell.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.381

Where do you need to go?

-No, I said you...

11:12.506 --> 11:14.841
-I'm kidding, Joshy.
-(chuckles) Sorry.

11:14.883 --> 11:18.553
Yes, we're homies. We know, we
know each other from the army.

11:18.595 --> 11:19.971

-The, uh, yeah.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.515

-Lebanon War.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.978
Jesus. How old were you?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.605
-Eighteen.
-Hmm.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.982
When you go to college,
we go to war.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.360
That's, uh...
Israel for you.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.404
You, you didn't go to college?

11:35.445 --> 11:36.738
No, I went to college.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.240
Studied philosophy.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.951
Yeah, no, you do the army,

11:40.992 --> 11:44.371
after the army
you do the-the university.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.456
And the army's more important.

11:46.498 --> 11:47.999
Know why?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.668
Hmm.

11:49.709 --> 11:54.005
'Cause you realize
not everything is about you.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.305
Yeah.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.766
Everybody seems real patriotic.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.768
And you got a whole country
full of people

12:06.810 --> 12:08.186
who know how to shoot a gun.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.564
You know how
to shoot a gun, huh?

12:10.605 --> 12:11.898
-Me?
-Yeah.

12:11.940 --> 12:12.983
-No, I'm, I'm...
-Yeah.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.526
I don't know how to shoot a gun.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.153
I'm an American--
I'm an American Jew,

12:16.194 --> 12:17.571
we don't do guns.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.614
-Well, what do you have
against guns? -Nothing.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.450
I mean, except that they kill
innocent people,

12:21.491 --> 12:22.659
like, all the time.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.077
(laughs)

12:24.119 --> 12:25.537
Guy.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.581
Pull over.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.708
-No, no, no, no, no. No, no...
-Uh... Everybody,

12:29.749 --> 12:32.669
-No. No. -...we need to stop
for five minutes.

12:32.711 --> 12:37.382
-Dude, just shh....
-Joshy needs to do pee pee.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.426
Joshy. Come on.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.430
JOSH:
All right.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.182
Okay, let's go.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.267
NITZAN:
Come.

12:47.309 --> 12:50.979
-Come on.
-Okay.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.189
(clears throat)

12:52.230 --> 12:56.067
(Nitzan and Guy speaking Hebrew)

12:56.109 --> 12:57.611
I'm gonna take
a little walk here.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.404
Well, be careful.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.198
-Don't get dehydrated.
-MAURA: No.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.908
I'm well aware of my hydration.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.951
Thank you.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.335
SARAH: God, why is Josh
being such a dick on this trip?

13:13.376 --> 13:16.880
I'm so... irritated

13:16.922 --> 13:19.341
by his, like,
"You're taking advantage."

13:19.382 --> 13:21.968
It's like
fucking patriarchal bullshit.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.221
What, because, like, you're the
guy, you're taking advantage?

13:24.262 --> 13:27.057
Like, like, I'm not even here,
like, I don't even have a say?

13:27.098 --> 13:29.476
Like, like, like, Lila and I
are, like, these, like,

13:29.518 --> 13:32.270
these, like, outlines and
you just, like, take your dick

13:32.312 --> 13:34.147
and fucking put it in us?

13:34.189 --> 13:36.191
You're... I mean...

13:36.233 --> 13:39.819
Hold on. Just to be clear,
this is all for you.

13:39.861 --> 13:42.739
-I'm just saying yes to every...
-(laughs)

13:42.781 --> 13:44.616
...fucking sexual inclination
that you have.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.618
Whoa, okay. Wow.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.620
I didn't realize
I was, like, torturing you.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.872
No-- you're not...
it's not torture.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.832
I'm just saying,
you wanted this.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.834
Why are you mad at me?

13:54.876 --> 13:56.503
I'm talking about Josh,

13:56.545 --> 13:58.171
and the, like,
"You're a love addict,"

13:58.213 --> 14:00.549
and, I mean, I'm sorry,
but that's, like,

14:00.590 --> 14:02.551
that's such bullshit.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.553
Like, love is addiction.

14:04.594 --> 14:07.931
I mean, it's a fucking oxymoron,
really.

14:07.973 --> 14:10.892
"Love addict"
is not an oxymoron.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.727
What you mean
is that it's redundant, right?

14:12.769 --> 14:14.437
Okay, whatever.
I-- that's not the point.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.897
If I'm an addict,
then everybody's an addict.

14:15.939 --> 14:18.400
I mean, love is,
like, uh, getting high,

14:18.441 --> 14:20.694
-that's what love feels like.
-No, it's not. No, it's not.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.862
Love is not being high
all the time.

14:22.904 --> 14:26.533
I don't want to be
fucking crazy high all the time.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.910
Sometimes,
I just want to hang out

14:28.952 --> 14:32.622
and watch TV and love our kids.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.499
God!

14:34.541 --> 14:38.336
Most unsatisfied person I know.

14:46.511 --> 14:50.223
(weakly):
Okay, I like TV.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.392
NITZAN:
Joshy, you ready?

14:52.434 --> 14:55.186
Feel like you guys are taking me
out to kill me, or something.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.479
GUY (laughing):
Don't worry about it.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.899
(horns honking)

14:59.941 --> 15:03.069
ALI: How long
does this usually take?

15:03.111 --> 15:04.904
I have to meet up
with my family.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.906
HUSSEN:
You never know.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.117
We do these checkpoints
twice a day.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.202
When I was a teenager,
when they built the wall,

15:11.244 --> 15:12.829
my mother would get so nervous,

15:12.871 --> 15:15.457
she'd smoke Marlboro Reds
in the car.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.001
And then you'd have to convince
her to roll the windows down.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.964
ALI: So she never
got used to it.

15:23.006 --> 15:25.300
HUSSEN:
No, she didn't get used to it.

15:25.342 --> 15:26.718
I think she still talks about it

15:26.760 --> 15:29.137
as if it were completely new.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.181
'Cause she...

15:31.222 --> 15:33.266
she knew it before
it was like that.

15:33.308 --> 15:36.186
-So, for her...
-Yeah.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.855
It's an offense to her memories.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.398
(Ali chuckles)

15:41.941 --> 15:43.360
ALI:
So we leave the car here.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.028
We just leave it
and we go on foot?

15:45.070 --> 15:46.655
HUSSEN:
Yeah, we walk through.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.073
When we get to the Israel side,
I'll show you how

15:48.114 --> 15:49.741
to get a taxi to your family.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.786
Oh... Okay.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.374
(horn blares,
indistinct chatter)

16:38.957 --> 16:40.375
MAURA:
Why are you here?

16:40.417 --> 16:41.835
YOUNGER MAURA:
I can't believe the way

16:41.876 --> 16:43.795
Moshe talks to you.

16:43.837 --> 16:47.882
And who is he, anyway?
Not family.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.843
No.

16:49.884 --> 16:52.846
He's no one.

16:52.887 --> 16:55.640
YOUNGER MAURA: Do you remember
when you thought

16:55.682 --> 17:00.645
if you weren't trans
you wouldn't hurt anymore?

17:07.569 --> 17:10.780
You know,
you abandoned me.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.996
MAURA:
I had... I had to choose.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.334
God was making me choose.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.504
YOUNGER MAURA: Just because
you hear God's voice

17:26.546 --> 17:28.757
doesn't mean it's God's voice.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.009
Look at you.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.260
You're here,

17:32.302 --> 17:34.721
and Ali's alive.

17:34.763 --> 17:36.681
MAURA:
We are here.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.058
I'm here.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.441
(softly):
I'm here.

17:46.483 --> 17:48.485
(loud buzzer sounds)

17:48.526 --> 17:50.528
(indistinct chatter)

17:52.071 --> 17:54.866
It's so crowded.
Is it always like this?

17:54.908 --> 17:57.952
It can be,
but it's totally random.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.788
(loud buzzer sounds)

17:59.829 --> 18:02.290
(man on P.A. speaking
in foreign language)

18:05.001 --> 18:06.169
-See you on the other side.
-What?

18:06.211 --> 18:07.337
I'll see you on the other side.

18:07.378 --> 18:08.713
Don't worry.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.673
(man repeating instructions
over P.A.)

18:10.715 --> 18:11.633
(loud buzzer sounds)

18:11.674 --> 18:13.384
Sorry.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.053
(people speaking
foreign language)

18:16.930 --> 18:18.640
(buzzer sounds)

18:21.100 --> 18:22.435
MAN:
Passport.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.234
Hey, can you look at me, please?
Thank you.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.110
(man continues speaking
over P.A.)

18:37.033 --> 18:38.493
(gunshot)

18:38.535 --> 18:39.828
What was that?

18:39.869 --> 18:41.079
(gunshots)

18:41.120 --> 18:43.832
-(men chuckle)
-Uh, no earmuffs?

18:43.873 --> 18:45.792
Dude,

18:45.834 --> 18:48.336
you have too much estrogen
around you.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.588
-All right, that's-that's true.
-Get that enough.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.258
Well... ready?

18:56.719 --> 18:59.347
-Opa...
-But just a second.

18:59.389 --> 19:02.225
What... what hand do you
masturbate with?

19:02.267 --> 19:03.935
-Both? -Okay.
-(chuckles)

19:03.977 --> 19:06.020
Hold it with both.

19:08.690 --> 19:09.691
Whoa.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.901
-Huh?
-Huh?

19:11.943 --> 19:13.194
NITZAN:
Looking good.

19:13.236 --> 19:16.281
You like it? Huh?

19:16.322 --> 19:19.117
-It's not... It's not terrible.
-Okay.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.577
-JOSH: Fuckin' A.
-GUY: Yeah. -Oh, yeah.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.078
Let's shoot a gun.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.038
-NITZAN: You know who
you look like? -Huh?

19:24.080 --> 19:25.623
Clint Eastwood.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.833
-(laughs)
-Shut the fuck up.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.126
-Look.
-Shut the fuck up.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.919
Let's do this shit.

19:37.844 --> 19:38.970
(gunshot)

19:41.222 --> 19:42.682
-Whoa, whoa!
-Hey, hey!

19:42.724 --> 19:45.518
-Joshy! Oh!
-NITZAN: Josh, Josh, Josh!

19:45.560 --> 19:48.980
-Put the gun down.
-Joshy! What are you doing?

19:49.022 --> 19:50.857
You don't do a pirouette
with a gun like this.

19:50.899 --> 19:52.525
-What, are you crazy?
-Drop it. Drop it.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.818
SHELLY:
You crazy kid!

19:53.860 --> 19:55.278
I'm sorry, Mom.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.863
-He was about to kill me!
-Mom, I'm sorry.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.740
-I'm sorry. -You pointed
the gun right at me!

19:58.781 --> 20:01.075
Mommy, Mommy, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.452
-What's going on?
-He pointed the gun right at me.

20:02.493 --> 20:03.786
-What is going on? -NITZAN: I
didn't tell him to twirl

20:03.828 --> 20:05.246
-with the gun in his hand,
you know. -What is going on?

20:05.288 --> 20:06.873
-He did it on his own.
-No, you go back... -Oh, my God.

20:06.915 --> 20:09.792
You go back to the bus.
And get that gun out of here.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.920
-What's going on?
-I didn't mean it, I...

20:11.961 --> 20:13.963
I freaked out.
I might...

20:14.005 --> 20:16.090
-You tried to kill me.
-I did not!

20:16.132 --> 20:17.467
I just got mixed up.

20:17.508 --> 20:18.968
I didn't mean to do that.
I did...

20:19.010 --> 20:21.512
I freaked, I just...
-MAURA: All right, all right.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.389
-Give them space. -What
happened? I heard Mom screaming.

20:23.431 --> 20:24.807
-Come on. Give them space.
-SHELLY: He tried to kill me.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.184
-SARAH: What?
-JOSH: I... I didn't!

20:26.225 --> 20:28.394
I ruined 'em, and now
they want to kill me.

20:28.436 --> 20:29.771
-MAURA: No, no, no.
-JOSH: I don't.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.522
Mom, I was actually trying
not to kill you.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.358
-MAURA: Relax, please.
-JOSH: I swear.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.193
I fucked up.
I'm a fuck-up, okay?

20:35.234 --> 20:38.029
SHELLY:
I don't want you to say that.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.698
I just want you to be happy.
I want you to be happy.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.409
-I love you.
-Okay, okay, if you want that...

20:43.451 --> 20:44.786
-If you want that...
-What?

20:44.827 --> 20:46.204
...you have to stop.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.081
You can't do that.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.666
The kissing me on the lips
is like an assault!

20:49.707 --> 20:51.709
What's wrong with kissing
on the lips?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.586
It's too much, it's just
too much-- it's weird.

20:53.628 --> 20:55.296
And the Mario.

20:55.338 --> 20:58.591
-I can't do Mario anymore.
-MAURA: Who is Mario?

20:58.633 --> 21:00.718
-SARAH: He's the driver, right?
-Mario's the person that she...

21:00.760 --> 21:03.262
...the character she does when
she can't deal with reality.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.390
-That's not true.
-That is true!

21:05.431 --> 21:07.266
SARAH: What?
What are you talking about?

21:09.143 --> 21:13.231
You have no idea what it's like
to be me in my body.

21:13.272 --> 21:17.193
To try to erase yourself.

21:17.235 --> 21:20.780
To be anxious
because of your kids.

21:20.822 --> 21:26.494
It was like... fingernails
on a chalkboard...

21:26.536 --> 21:30.039
when they would call me Mommy.

21:30.081 --> 21:34.627
And those two times
that I was in

21:34.669 --> 21:37.547
those two mental hospitals...

21:37.588 --> 21:39.799
Wait, I thought
she was in Fresno.

21:39.841 --> 21:42.427
SHELLY:
It was a relief

21:42.468 --> 21:44.595
not being a mother.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.681
SARAH:
Do you hate us?

21:46.723 --> 21:49.225
SHELLY: No, I don't hate you,
but your Moppa's not

21:49.267 --> 21:50.768
the only one who's suffered.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.312
SARAH: Mom, I...
What are you talking about?

21:53.354 --> 21:54.981
I said it in my show.

21:55.023 --> 21:56.482
-I wasn't there.
-Yes, exactly, exactly.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.651
You weren't there,
but your sisters were,

21:58.693 --> 22:01.821
and your Moppa was,
and I loudly exclaimed

22:01.863 --> 22:03.322
that I had a secret.

22:03.364 --> 22:05.199
And none of you
asked me about it.

22:05.241 --> 22:08.202
You never asked me about it.
Strangers asked me about it.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.871
You know, people from Denmark...

22:09.912 --> 22:11.956
-Yes, yes.
-Scandinavian people...

22:11.998 --> 22:14.083
Your secret... your secret.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.543
You were talking about me.

22:15.585 --> 22:18.546
No. No.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.676
I was talking about me.

22:23.718 --> 22:25.303
SARAH:
What was it?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.513
I mean, I'm sorry
that we didn't ask.

22:27.555 --> 22:28.931
I didn't... I thought...
I didn't...

22:28.973 --> 22:31.017
We just figured
it would be rude.

22:31.059 --> 22:35.313
I was ten years old.

22:37.482 --> 22:40.068
SHELLY: Then there was this
teacher, this Mr. Stenger,

22:40.109 --> 22:42.195
who said that he saw
my talent, or so I,

22:42.236 --> 22:45.948
I thought. And then,
when we were alone,

22:45.990 --> 22:49.118
the things happened,
and so I stopped eating.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.663
(Josh gasps, sobs)

22:53.706 --> 22:57.043
SHELLY:
I was...

22:57.085 --> 22:59.879
molested.
