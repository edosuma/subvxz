We need to ensure

00:55.423 --> 00:58.326

continues.

00:58.426 --> 01:01.395
This is our chance to keep
control of the political system

01:01.495 --> 01:04.698
and protect our interests
for decades to come.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.306

01:21.149 --> 01:22.783
You're very lucky.

Thank you.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.286
What can I do for you?

01:25.386 --> 01:26.687
McCord needs ad money.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.257
This next phase
of the race is crucial.

01:29.357 --> 01:31.159
- How much?
- Ten million.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.627
With continued support
if the race tightens.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.998
Okay. If I go with McCord,
I'll need direct access.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.133
Of course.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.368
I know he'd welcome
your thoughts

01:40.468 --> 01:42.703
on the financial sector
and tax policy.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.176
I want McCord
to sponsor an amendment

01:48.276 --> 01:50.378
to Baden-Fost
cutting capital requirements

01:50.478 --> 01:52.746
for derivative trading by 50%

01:52.846 --> 01:54.715
and push it through
the Senate Banking Committee.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.417
That's not possible.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.187
Direct access is one thing,
but determining legislation

01:59.287 --> 02:00.621
one way or the other
is not something

02:00.721 --> 02:02.122
a donation can get you.

02:05.193 --> 02:07.328
In the '80s, I told my partner
I wanted to raise

02:07.428 --> 02:09.597
a billion dollars
for a private equity fund

02:09.697 --> 02:12.333
an unprecedented goal.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.602
Neither of us had ever worked
a day in asset management

02:14.702 --> 02:16.604
but we knew there was
money to be made.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.840
Now, luckily, my partner
was, uh, wise enough

02:19.940 --> 02:22.743
to go along with my vision.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.212
Then we ended up
falling short of that goal

02:24.312 --> 02:27.615
raising 960 million
in under a year.

02:27.715 --> 02:30.884
Forty short,
but we took it in stride.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.388
We put word out we wanted
to raise a billion in funds

02:34.488 --> 02:38.759
and the people who would
have given us 50 gave a 100.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.027
We set the framework.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.295
They stretched
their boundaries.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.531
Now, I need you
to stretch yours.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.766
Float the idea,
and then get me a meeting

02:45.866 --> 02:46.734
to talk it over with McCord.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.406
I'll see what I can do.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.482
We'd like you
to look into Erica Myles

03:01.582 --> 03:04.117
and her assistant, Sandra Fuchs.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.186
The Finance Director
for Right To Action?

03:06.287 --> 03:09.056
- Yes.
- What's your interest in them?

03:09.156 --> 03:11.091
Erica approached me
about the possibility

03:11.191 --> 03:13.093
of coming to work
for our foundation.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.762
She asked me
to keep it confidential

03:14.862 --> 03:17.365
which is understandable,
given her current position.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.467
We just need to do
due diligence.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.134
That shouldn't be a problem.

03:21.235 --> 03:24.305
We'd also like you
to look into an Anna Carr.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.206
This is her
professional website.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.709
- What's your connection to her?
- I'd rather not say.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.010
Do you know her real name
or where she lives?

03:30.110 --> 03:31.279
Nope.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.484
I'm afraid we can't help you.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.686
The only way that we could
find out her real identity

03:38.786 --> 03:42.323
is through either pretexting
or impersonating being a client.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.892
And given the fact
that she works as an escort

03:44.992 --> 03:47.828
I doubt she'd be willing to
reveal her identity voluntarily.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.229
And why is that a problem?

03:49.330 --> 03:51.432
Well, pretexting
is against the law.

03:51.532 --> 03:54.034
And we're a legitimate
investigative firm.

03:54.134 --> 03:56.704
We conduct extensive, in-depth
research, and help to identify

03:56.804 --> 03:58.406
and eliminate our client's
vulnerabilities.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.441
RIFKIND:
To do that, we must abide

04:00.541 --> 04:02.175
by all local,
state and federal laws.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.011
How much?

04:04.111 --> 04:06.280
It's not a question of money.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.682
We can help you with Erica Myles
