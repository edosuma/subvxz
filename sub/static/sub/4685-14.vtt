Hey, Axel, FYI,

00:13.390 --> 00:15.516
all the fun happens

00:11.262 --> 00:15.516
on the trip down.

00:17.894 --> 00:20.294
- I don't go down my slide until
- Nanny Agatha sanitizes it.

00:23.816 --> 00:24.860
Your slide?

00:24.861 --> 00:25.902
You can't own the slide.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.153
Slides belong to the people!

00:30.740 --> 00:33.409
Go away or I'll call my nanny.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.598
Oh, you wanna play

00:34.599 --> 00:35.661
the nanny card?

This kid Axel is

00:44.922 --> 00:46.756
hogging the slide.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.466
Oh, well, I'm sure

00:48.467 --> 00:50.050
he'll move if

00:46.881 --> 00:50.050
we ask him nicely.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.445
- Hi, sweetie,
- would you please...

00:51.469 --> 00:53.429
Shut your piehole.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.871
Okay, let's go find his nanny.

00:57.872 --> 00:59.184
We need a brat whisperer.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.355
Oh!

01:04.440 --> 01:05.566
Hi. We're looking

01:05.567 --> 01:06.692

01:15.743 --> 01:17.057
Uh, I am Zuri's

01:17.058 --> 01:18.370
nanny, Jessie.

01:18.496 --> 01:20.310
I'm also a little creeped out

01:20.311 --> 01:22.124
by her human footrest.

01:24.752 --> 01:25.920
- I want to go
- on the slide!

01:26.045 --> 01:27.485
But it seems your kid

01:27.486 --> 01:28.923
thinks it's a library.

01:29.048 --> 01:30.237
So, if you wouldn't mind

01:30.238 --> 01:31.425
just asking him to share?

01:40.352 --> 01:41.602
Axel doesn't share.

01:41.727 --> 01:42.812
I'm pretty sure you

01:42.813 --> 01:43.896
don't own Central Park.

01:44.022 --> 01:45.336
For her sake, I hope

01:45.337 --> 01:46.649
she doesn't own a mirror.

01:48.860 --> 01:50.194
And for the mirror's sake.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.789
Short, ridiculous-looking men.

09:00.082 --> 09:02.709
First, training drills.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.715
- That's what helped me
- to become state champ.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.026
Bertram, time has

09:07.027 --> 09:08.507
not been kind to you.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.262
Moving on.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.055
- Let's work on
- speed skills.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.723
- These are called
- Foot Fires.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.645
(CHUCKLES)

09:21.770 --> 09:22.813
You know, this is less

09:22.814 --> 09:23.855
wrestling and more

09:21.770 --> 09:23.855
Riverdancing.

09:24.898 --> 09:25.898
I agree.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.168
- Maybe if you put
- on some music,

09:27.192 --> 09:28.360
We could have

09:28.361 --> 09:29.528
a dance-off to the death.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.530
(CHUCKLES)

09:31.655 --> 09:33.074
So, one of the other

09:33.075 --> 09:34.492
nannies told me that

09:31.655 --> 09:34.492
Agatha has this blog,

09:34.616 --> 09:36.035
Toddler Tattler,

09:36.036 --> 09:37.453
where she posts

09:34.616 --> 09:37.453
pictures of bad nannies.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.579
Oh, I bet a few of

09:39.580 --> 09:41.581
my exes are on there.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.293
Let's check it out.

09:47.546 --> 09:48.547
Oh, no.

09:49.548 --> 09:50.779
JESSIE: Oh, my gosh!

09:50.780 --> 09:52.009
That's me.

09:52.134 --> 09:53.487
- It looks like
- I'm spanking you!

09:53.511 --> 09:55.472
- Your mother's going
- to think I'm spanking you!

09:56.596 --> 09:58.223
Don't worry, Jessie.

09:58.349 --> 09:59.871
I'll have Chubby the Bear

09:59.872 --> 10:01.393
testify that you're

09:58.349 --> 10:01.393
a great nanny.

10:01.519 --> 10:03.625
And Millie the Mermaid.

10:03.626 --> 10:05.730
Her alibis are watertight!

10:06.731 --> 10:09.193
Zuri, don't be ridiculous.

10:09.318 --> 10:10.918
- Chubby and Millie
- don't even like me.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.137
- Anyway, your mom
- is out of town,

10:14.198 --> 10:16.033
- So maybe she won't
- even see the photos.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.681
Yeah, it's not like Mom

10:17.682 --> 10:19.203
has a team of publicists

10:19.328 --> 10:20.537
sending her e-mails

10:20.538 --> 10:21.746
every time her name

10:19.328 --> 10:21.746
is mentioned online.

10:23.748 --> 10:24.749
BOTH: Uh-oh.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.632
Okay, warm up's over.

10:31.633 --> 10:33.008
Time for some real drills.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.426
Put these on.

10:34.552 --> 10:35.719
(BOTH GROANING)

10:35.844 --> 10:36.887
Come on, come on,

10:36.888 --> 10:37.929
put them on.

10:38.055 --> 10:39.911
Okay, Flip the Turtle

10:39.912 --> 10:41.766
teaches you leverage.

10:41.892 --> 10:43.311
You two get on one side

10:43.312 --> 10:44.728
and try to flip me over.

10:46.188 --> 10:48.732
Come on, flip the turtle.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.734
- Wow! A free shot
- at Bertram?

10:50.859 --> 10:51.899
I just got my second wind!

10:52.861 --> 10:54.530
(GRUNTING)

10:54.654 --> 10:57.335
- Our apparently resistible - force has met
- Your immovable object.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.161
(GRUNTS)

11:02.538 --> 11:03.663
Oh, he's tipping!

11:03.788 --> 11:04.915
Like the leaning tower

11:04.916 --> 11:06.041
of too much pizza!

11:06.166 --> 11:07.167
Whoa!

11:07.292 --> 11:08.752
(BOTH SCREAM)

11:09.753 --> 11:10.754
(CHUCKLES)

11:10.879 --> 11:11.755
(LUKE GROANS)

11:11.880 --> 11:14.091
With extra cheese.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.138
Okay, we need

11:19.139 --> 11:20.598
to delete any e-mails

11:17.677 --> 11:20.598
about Agatha's blog

11:20.722 --> 11:22.079
from your mom's inbox

11:22.080 --> 11:23.434
before she reads them.

11:23.559 --> 11:24.702
- Hmm, do you know
- her password?

11:24.726 --> 11:26.144
Uh-uh.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.248
- Huh. Well, it's usually
- something simple to remember.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.190
- So, what's your mom's
- favorite thing?

11:30.315 --> 11:31.775
That's easy. Me!

11:31.900 --> 11:33.193
(CHUCKLES)

11:33.318 --> 11:35.987
Z-U-R-I. Zuri.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.633
- (TABLET CHIMES)
- Uh, it didn't work.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.825
What! I need to have

11:39.826 --> 11:41.910
a serious talk with Mom.

11:45.247 --> 11:46.415
Mommy!

11:46.540 --> 11:49.751
Zuri! (KISSING SOUNDS)

11:52.045 --> 11:53.589
- Who is my favorite
- little girl?

11:53.713 --> 11:56.592
Well, I thought it was me!

11:56.716 --> 11:58.427
JESSIE: Uh...

11:58.552 --> 11:59.908
Hey, Christina!

11:59.909 --> 12:01.263
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)

12:01.388 --> 12:02.681
How was your trip?

12:02.806 --> 12:04.825
- It was great. It turns out
- I'm huge in Luxembourg.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.434
But then again,

12:06.435 --> 12:08.019
it is a very small country.

12:08.145 --> 12:10.210
I got an earlier flight

12:10.211 --> 12:12.274
and I wanted to call you guys,

12:08.145 --> 12:12.274
but my cell phone died.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.734
Oh, fantastic!

12:14.859 --> 12:16.424
I just mean

12:16.425 --> 12:17.988
fantastic that you got

12:14.859 --> 12:17.988
an early flight and all.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.299
- Why don't you give me
- your cell phone

12:19.323 --> 12:20.841
- And I will charge that
- right up for ya?

12:20.865 --> 12:21.888
Oh, don't be silly.

12:21.889 --> 12:22.909
I can charge it myself,

12:23.034 --> 12:24.845
- and I'll just - check e-mail
- On my computer.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.184
Oh, your computer

12:26.185 --> 12:27.498
isn't working.

12:27.623 --> 12:28.686
I was just about

12:28.687 --> 12:29.749
to take it to the shop.

12:29.874 --> 12:30.959
And I will take this

12:30.960 --> 12:32.043
to the shop as well.

12:32.169 --> 12:34.004
But this isn't broken.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.193
Enough with

12:35.194 --> 12:36.256
the chitchat! Let's go!

12:40.511 --> 12:41.512
That was weird.

12:44.181 --> 12:45.182
LUKE: Hi, Mom!

12:45.307 --> 12:47.017
RAVI: Hi, Mrs. Mommy!

12:47.142 --> 12:49.102
- Welcome home. - Dinner might be
- A little late.

12:52.356 --> 12:53.982
But not as weird as that.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.653
It's time to take care

12:57.654 --> 12:59.029
of Agatha once and for all.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.780
Ooh, rumble!

13:03.825 --> 13:04.909
Hey, nannies!

13:05.910 --> 13:06.911
That's right.

13:06.912 --> 13:07.912
We're back.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.749
Speaking of backs.

13:10.874 --> 13:13.794
- Listen, I know you're busy - shunning
and all, - But think of your kids.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.297
They're miserable.

13:17.422 --> 13:18.882
- It's time to stand up
- to Agatha.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.197
What about her blog?

13:21.198 --> 13:22.344
I need this job.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.971
And you'll keep it

13:23.972 --> 13:25.472
if we all just

13:22.469 --> 13:25.472
stick together.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.475
Look, we spend all day

13:27.476 --> 13:29.351
telling our kids,

13:29.476 --> 13:31.354
"As soon as you get to

13:31.355 --> 13:33.230
the park, you can run and

13:29.476 --> 13:33.230
play however you want."

13:33.355 --> 13:34.962
But we're all so scared

13:34.963 --> 13:36.567
of Agatha they never can!

13:36.692 --> 13:37.735
So, it's time

13:37.736 --> 13:38.777
to fight back.

13:38.902 --> 13:41.175
She may have the blog

13:41.176 --> 13:43.448
and the supercool accent,

13:43.574 --> 13:44.783
but we have the numbers.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.327
I, for one, am done

13:46.328 --> 13:47.745
being afraid of Agatha!

13:49.621 --> 13:50.706
What's going on?

13:50.707 --> 13:51.790
(GASPS)

13:51.915 --> 13:53.751
- Son of a biscuit,
- you're sneaky!

13:55.753 --> 13:57.630
Does anyone have anything

13:57.631 --> 13:59.506
they wish to say to me?

13:59.631 --> 14:01.029
Actually, yes. We do!

14:01.030 --> 14:02.426
Right, guys?

14:04.344 --> 14:05.345
Guys?

14:06.346 --> 14:10.141
Well, this is awkward.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.103
Did you really think

14:12.104 --> 14:13.937
they'd listen to

14:10.267 --> 14:13.937
some nanny wannabe,

14:14.062 --> 14:15.689
some faux pair?

14:15.814 --> 14:17.525
Come on, Jessie,

14:17.526 --> 14:19.234
let me at her!

14:19.359 --> 14:20.382
I'm gonna knock

14:20.383 --> 14:21.403
that tooth straight!

14:24.114 --> 14:25.407
Thank you, Zuri,

14:25.408 --> 14:26.700
but it's no use.

14:26.825 --> 14:27.826
(SIGHS)

14:29.244 --> 14:30.434
I think that mole

14:30.435 --> 14:31.622
has evil powers.

14:32.831 --> 14:33.832
(BOTH SHUDDER)

14:39.379 --> 14:40.672
All right, Kipling.

14:40.798 --> 14:42.675
If Ravi loses this thing,

14:42.676 --> 14:44.551
you cannot eat Luke.

14:45.636 --> 14:50.098
Ladies and lizard,

14:50.223 --> 14:51.863
- tonight, we have
- an epic grudge match,

14:51.975 --> 14:54.290
Brother against brother,

14:54.291 --> 14:56.605
in order to settle

14:51.975 --> 14:56.605
once and for all,

14:56.730 --> 14:58.065
uh, whatever it is

14:58.066 --> 14:59.399
they were fighting

14:56.730 --> 14:59.399
about this time.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.525
Yay.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.486
- First, we have
- that freckled fiend,

15:02.611 --> 15:05.029
That thorn in my side,

15:05.155 --> 15:06.636
such a rebel he only brushes

15:06.637 --> 15:08.116
his teeth twice a week,

15:08.241 --> 15:09.785
Luke the Lion!

15:09.909 --> 15:11.703
Yay! That's my boy!

15:16.207 --> 15:18.001
Viva El Luke.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.844
Isn't he intimidating, folks?

15:29.053 --> 15:30.722
Next, hailing from India

15:30.848 --> 15:32.600
and weighing in at

15:32.601 --> 15:34.351
a staggering 62 pounds,

15:34.476 --> 15:36.520
the Mumbai marauder,

15:36.645 --> 15:37.645
Ravi the Ripper!

15:37.729 --> 15:41.316
Yay! That's my other boy!

15:49.741 --> 15:51.493
Okay, let's get this

15:51.494 --> 15:53.244
show on the road.

15:49.741 --> 15:53.244
Shake hands.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.665
(BOTH GROANING)

15:56.790 --> 15:58.814
All right, on my mark,

15:58.815 --> 16:00.836
try to pin the other one

15:56.790 --> 16:00.836
to the mat.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.546
Ready, set...

16:05.256 --> 16:06.675
(BOTH GROANING)

16:07.885 --> 16:08.886
Luke?

16:09.887 --> 16:10.888
Yeah, Ravi?

16:12.138 --> 16:13.306
What were we fighting

16:13.307 --> 16:14.474
about again?

16:15.600 --> 16:16.601
I can't remember.

16:18.896 --> 16:20.104
Luke?

16:20.230 --> 16:21.356
Yeah, Ravi?

16:23.107 --> 16:25.173
I think I have drooled

16:25.174 --> 16:27.237
a little on your shoulder.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.926
It's okay. I'm about

16:28.927 --> 16:30.490
to barf on your back.

16:30.615 --> 16:31.976
- Okay, break it up.
- Break it up.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.704
(CHUCKLES)

16:35.829 --> 16:37.790
Oh, they look

16:37.791 --> 16:39.750
so beaten-down

16:35.829 --> 16:39.750
and exhausted.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.587
And not arguing.

16:43.588 --> 16:45.547
Oh! Way to go, Bertram!

16:48.258 --> 16:50.594
Sweet dreams, boys.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.388
(GRUNTS) I love you.

16:55.640 --> 16:56.640
Ravi?

16:56.725 --> 16:57.976
Yes, Luke?

16:58.101 --> 16:59.978
Do you think Bertram

16:59.979 --> 17:01.855
did this to us on purpose?

17:01.980 --> 17:04.900
I am certain of it.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.318
He played us like a sitar.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.962
- Stop it, stop it!
- Get your own blanket.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.164
Hi! Christina!

17:20.290 --> 17:21.959
Hi! So, can I have

17:21.960 --> 17:23.627
my computer and my phone?

17:23.752 --> 17:25.525
What computer?

17:25.526 --> 17:27.297
What phone?

17:27.422 --> 17:29.779
While you guys were out,

17:29.780 --> 17:32.135
I went on Luke's laptop

17:27.422 --> 17:32.135
and checked my e-mail.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.720
And someone sent me

17:33.721 --> 17:35.179
a very interesting link

17:35.305 --> 17:36.598
to a blog called

17:36.599 --> 17:37.891
Toddler Tattler.

17:38.016 --> 17:39.183
- Mom, Jessie
- was framed!

17:40.769 --> 17:42.500
Okay, I know the pictures

17:42.501 --> 17:44.230
look bad, but it's all fake.

17:44.355 --> 17:45.996
- I mean, it's real,
- but I didn't do it.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.908
- I mean, I did it,
- but it's out of context!

17:49.193 --> 17:50.675
Okay, I would never hurt

17:50.676 --> 17:52.155
a hair on Zuri's head.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.073
- And I watch her
- every second.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.993
- There was just gum - in my hair.
- Mmm-hmm!

17:56.117 --> 17:57.911
- Look, this is where
- I had to cut it out.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.203
- What?
- Oh!

18:00.204 --> 18:01.080
When did you do that?

18:01.205 --> 18:02.833
- Okay, maybe not
- every second,

18:05.084 --> 18:07.004
- And I'm sure she
- used safety scissors.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.773
- Please tell me you
- used safety scissors.

18:08.797 --> 18:10.157
- If it helps you
- sleep at night.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.219
- The point is
- I'm a good nanny...

18:15.345 --> 18:16.680
I believe you.

18:16.681 --> 18:18.015
So, please, don't fire me...

18:15.345 --> 18:18.015
Wait, what?

18:18.139 --> 18:19.265
I trust you.

18:19.390 --> 18:20.868
- You've never given me
- any reason not to.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.770
So if you say the pictures

18:22.771 --> 18:24.646
were taken out of context,

18:24.771 --> 18:25.814
I believe you.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.358
- You really have
- faith in me?

18:28.483 --> 18:30.297
Of course. Plus, we have you

18:30.298 --> 18:32.111
under 24-hour surveillance.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.741
Did you know you

18:35.742 --> 18:37.034
are a sleep-eater?

18:39.327 --> 18:40.808
That explains my waking up

18:40.809 --> 18:42.288
in a pool of gravy!

18:43.289 --> 18:45.333
Now we know. (CHUCKLES)

18:45.458 --> 18:48.819
- You know, I have a history of - the paparazzi
taking photos - Of me out of context.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.173
I mean, look!

18:52.298 --> 18:54.113
Look at this one,

18:54.114 --> 18:55.927
where I'm supposedly

18:52.298 --> 18:55.927
devouring a hamburger.

18:56.053 --> 18:58.473
I mean, everyone knows

18:58.474 --> 19:00.891
from my line of tofurgers

18:56.053 --> 19:00.891
that I am a vegan!

19:01.892 --> 19:03.184
Mmm-hmm.

19:05.687 --> 19:07.043
I was just smelling

19:07.044 --> 19:08.398
it for a second.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.150
Right, of course.

19:10.151 --> 19:11.776
I'm always smelling

19:08.523 --> 19:11.776
hamburgers.

19:11.902 --> 19:13.236
With my mouth.

19:17.074 --> 19:18.721
Not so high!

19:18.722 --> 19:20.368
I get nosebleeds!

19:21.912 --> 19:23.872
Yo, Agatha!

19:23.873 --> 19:25.832
Let's chitchat.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.146
Fiona, did you put

19:27.147 --> 19:28.334
something in my tea?

19:28.459 --> 19:30.149
I seem to be having

19:30.150 --> 19:31.838
a hideous hallucination.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.236
It ain't your tea.

19:34.237 --> 19:35.466
It's me.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.152
- I'm back, and I'm going
- to ask you one more time

19:37.176 --> 19:38.533
To take down your bogus blog.

19:38.534 --> 19:39.888
And then post an apology.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.806
Or else!

19:41.932 --> 19:43.307
Or else what?

19:43.433 --> 19:44.872
See this? This is

19:44.873 --> 19:46.310
a can of butt-kick,

19:46.436 --> 19:47.583
and my mommy's

19:47.584 --> 19:48.730
gonna open it up

19:48.855 --> 19:49.878
and apply it

19:49.879 --> 19:50.899
to you liberally!

19:52.442 --> 19:53.610
What a pity that

19:53.611 --> 19:54.778
she's not here.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.571
- Hello.
- Hello!

19:56.696 --> 19:57.697
(GASPS) Yikes!

20:01.034 --> 20:02.994
I know, right?

20:03.120 --> 20:04.392
Christina Ross?

20:04.393 --> 20:05.663
I'm such a fan.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.100
- Your line of carb-free
- pet food

20:07.124 --> 20:08.543
Changed my little

20:08.544 --> 20:09.960
Jabba the Cat's life!

20:10.085 --> 20:11.754
(CHUCKLES)

20:11.755 --> 20:13.421
I can already see more

20:10.085 --> 20:13.421
definition in his tail.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.899
- What is - Christina Ross
- Doing here?

20:14.923 --> 20:17.217
She's my backup,

20:17.218 --> 20:19.510
my wingwoman, my BFF.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.345
Uh, she's my boss

20:22.973 --> 20:24.951
- and she's here to make sure
- you take down your blog.

20:24.975 --> 20:25.976
Or else my 4,824,951

20:25.977 --> 20:26.977
Flitter followers,

20:32.482 --> 20:33.858
give or take a few,

20:33.984 --> 20:35.006
are going to hear

20:35.007 --> 20:36.027
the truth about you.

20:36.153 --> 20:38.072
"Nanny Agatha,

20:38.073 --> 20:39.990
unpleasant to children,

20:40.115 --> 20:42.993
"to nannies,

20:43.118 --> 20:44.494
"to be near..."

20:47.080 --> 20:49.041
Should I continue?

20:49.042 --> 20:51.001
I have 80 characters left.

20:51.126 --> 20:53.483
Use them to say

20:53.484 --> 20:55.839
"Axel still wears

20:51.126 --> 20:55.839
super-absorbent Kidaroos."

20:57.340 --> 20:58.779
Nanny Agatha,

20:58.780 --> 21:00.218
do something!

21:00.343 --> 21:01.886
You can't post that.

21:01.887 --> 21:03.429
It'll ruin my career.

21:03.554 --> 21:04.430
- Now you know
- how it feels.

21:04.555 --> 21:05.932
NANNIES: Mmm-hmm!

21:06.057 --> 21:08.351
(WHISPERS) Cow.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.080
- Oh, I'm sorry,
- did you say something?

21:11.104 --> 21:12.730
Did you say "hit send"?

21:12.856 --> 21:14.420
No, no, no!

21:14.421 --> 21:15.984
Uh, all right, all right!

21:16.109 --> 21:17.110
I'll take down

21:17.111 --> 21:18.111
Toddler Tattler.

21:18.236 --> 21:19.737
(ALL CHEER)

21:22.281 --> 21:23.574
Let's go, Axel.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.785
We'll find a better

21:24.786 --> 21:25.869
place to play.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.704
(IN BRITISH ACCENT) Tah-tah.

21:27.829 --> 21:28.914
Okay, this accent

21:28.915 --> 21:29.998
never gets old.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.123
It's old.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.542
(CHRISTINA CHUCKLES)

21:32.667 --> 21:34.044
Thanks, Jessie. You rock.

21:35.586 --> 21:36.587
Thanks, Christina.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.382
My pleasure.

21:38.383 --> 21:40.050
Anything for my girls.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.176
Oh!

21:41.300 --> 21:42.406
All right,

21:42.407 --> 21:43.511
now let's go play.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.556
- Last one - to the swing set
- Is a doodie head!

21:46.931 --> 21:49.100
Now, about your password.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.769
Zuri, come push me!

21:51.895 --> 21:54.043
I better go.

21:54.044 --> 21:56.191
When I tire her out,

21:51.895 --> 21:56.191
it's easier to put her to bed.

21:58.526 --> 21:59.962
- Okay, guys, I'm going
- to teach you

21:59.986 --> 22:00.987
A little wrestling move

22:00.988 --> 22:01.988
I learned from Bertram.

22:02.113 --> 22:04.533
Ah, this brings back

22:04.534 --> 22:06.951
memories from

22:02.113 --> 22:06.951
my day in the ring.

22:07.077 --> 22:09.433
Too bad I sustained

22:09.434 --> 22:11.789
this career-ending injury.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.791
- You guys think
- you're so tough.

22:13.917 --> 22:15.336
My dad raised me to be

22:15.337 --> 22:16.753
a self-defense machine.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.879
- It's like I have eyes
- in the back of my... Hey!

22:20.339 --> 22:22.633
(LAUGHS) Whoa!

22:22.759 --> 22:24.679
- Please don't hurt me,
- please. Please, please.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.620
Remember this

22:28.621 --> 22:30.225
the next time

22:27.013 --> 22:30.225
I want the remote.
