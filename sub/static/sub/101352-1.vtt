00:36.577 --> 00:40.515
<i>There's an old Native
American proverb that says...</i>

00:40.548 --> 00:43.484
<i>inside every person,
there are two bears...</i>

00:43.518 --> 00:45.919
<i>forever locked in combat
for your soul.</i>

00:45.952 --> 00:49.022
<i>One bear is all things good.</i>

00:49.056 --> 00:52.527
<i>Compassion, love, trust.</i>

00:52.560 --> 00:55.530
<i>The other is all things evil.</i>

00:56.129 --> 00:58.299
<i>Fear, shame,</i>

00:58.333 --> 01:00.468
<i>and self-destruction.</i>

01:04.539 --> 01:06.474
- What's happening?
- We have to run...

01:06.507 --> 01:08.276
as fast as we can!

01:08.309 --> 01:09.976
Wait!

01:15.416 --> 01:18.653
Don't let go of my hand!

01:37.070 --> 01:38.406
What's happening?

01:39.674 --> 01:41.242
Here!
Hide here!

01:42.943 --> 01:44.412
I have to go help them.

01:44.445 --> 01:46.214
- No! No, Dad, please!
- Dani!

01:46.247 --> 01:48.002
Please don't leave me alone!

01:48.014 --> 01:50.218
Dani,
I have to go back.

01:50.251 --> 01:51.252
Stay here.

01:55.122 --> 01:56.257
Hey!

01:57.492 --> 02:00.294
Run! No! Get away!

02:00.561 --> 02:01.596
Run!

02:03.029 --> 02:04.365
No!

03:27.682 --> 03:29.183
Hello?

03:39.092 --> 03:42.597
Hello? Let me out of here!

03:42.630 --> 03:43.764
<i>Relax, Dani.</i>

03:43.798 --> 03:45.600
<i>I'm on my way to you.</i>

03:51.706 --> 03:54.709
Where am I?
Where is my family?

03:54.742 --> 03:58.346
I know you're scared,
but you're safe now.

03:58.379 --> 04:01.449
If I could come in,
I'll explain.

04:01.482 --> 04:02.750
Would that be all right?

04:12.326 --> 04:14.127
Doors. Infirmary.

04:23.371 --> 04:25.105
Hi, Dani.

04:25.138 --> 04:26.707
I'm Dr. Reyes.

04:26.741 --> 04:29.176
If you take a seat,
I'll free your hand.

04:42.890 --> 04:44.825
Dani, what I'm about
to tell you...

04:44.859 --> 04:47.328
is going to be very difficult.

04:49.297 --> 04:52.433
An F5 tornado touched down
on your reservation.

04:54.435 --> 04:55.369
No.

04:55.403 --> 04:58.239
You're the sole survivor
of a terrible tragedy.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.241
No, no.

05:03.177 --> 05:06.747
It was growling!
Something was chasing us!

05:06.781 --> 05:08.316
What?

05:11.285 --> 05:13.554
Sometimes trauma makes us
remember things...

05:13.588 --> 05:14.755
that aren't real.

05:18.659 --> 05:20.461
Here.

05:20.494 --> 05:23.129
I think this may be yours.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.267
I'm really sorry.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.451
Why didn't I just die with them?

05:44.752 --> 05:46.152
Why me?

05:46.187 --> 05:48.789
Survivor's guilt is a
common reaction to trauma.

05:49.490 --> 05:50.591
We look for reasons.

05:51.792 --> 05:54.795
Most of the time,
we find none.

05:54.829 --> 05:56.330
But the reason you survived...

05:57.798 --> 06:00.368
is because you're
a very uncommon girl.

06:01.769 --> 06:05.439
Your reservation was wiped
off the face of the earth.

06:05.473 --> 06:07.808
But you made it out
with barely a scratch.

06:10.945 --> 06:12.780
Do you know what mutants are?

06:14.615 --> 06:17.418
Mutation most often
occurs in puberty.

06:17.451 --> 06:21.355
You might spend the first
13 years of your life...

06:21.389 --> 06:22.556
relatively normal.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.726
Then, just like that...

06:25.760 --> 06:28.763
you come of age and
discover your true nature.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.767
What's my true nature?

06:32.800 --> 06:34.502
We'll have to figure
that out together.

06:38.506 --> 06:40.274
Then how do you know
I'm a mutant?

06:40.307 --> 06:41.442
The man I work for

06:41.475 --> 06:43.444
has a way of recognizing
new mutants...

06:43.477 --> 06:45.846
the moment their condition
reveals itself.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.482
That's how we discovered you

06:48.516 --> 06:49.717
and your fellow patients.

06:52.253 --> 06:54.522
You're not alone, Dani.

06:59.460 --> 07:03.397
This is a facility for
young mutants like yourself.

07:03.431 --> 07:04.965
Teens who need
some extra care...

07:04.999 --> 07:08.636
before they can go on to
live healthy adult lives.

07:11.505 --> 07:14.608
There's some warm clothes.
Toiletries.

07:20.414 --> 07:22.283
How long do I have to stay here?

07:22.316 --> 07:24.385
Until I decide
you're not a danger.

07:24.852 --> 07:26.554
Danger to who?

07:27.321 --> 07:28.823
Yourself.

07:33.928 --> 07:35.529
You have been through a lot.

07:37.531 --> 07:38.799
Get some rest, okay?

07:39.834 --> 07:42.036
We'll talk more in the morning.

07:42.069 --> 07:43.270
Dr. Reyes.

07:46.006 --> 07:48.242
There's really no one left?

07:50.711 --> 07:53.547
But you're in a safe place now.

07:53.581 --> 07:55.850
Nothing can hurt you
in here, Dani.

07:56.884 --> 07:58.452
Good night.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.057
Yesterday, I asked you
to think about...

08:15.069 --> 08:17.605
the first time
your mutation manifested.

08:20.608 --> 08:22.943
Would anyone like to share?

08:22.977 --> 08:24.411
Sam?

08:25.713 --> 08:26.714
Illyana?

08:29.517 --> 08:30.584
Roberto?

08:32.086 --> 08:33.988
Rahne?

08:34.020 --> 08:38.893
Look, we can't help each other
unless we talk to each other.

08:38.926 --> 08:41.495
I've said this a hundred times.

08:41.529 --> 08:46.467
This program can't help you
if you refuse to participate.

08:46.500 --> 08:49.870
So, Rahne,
why don't you start?

08:51.872 --> 08:52.873
I...

08:57.978 --> 08:59.647
Please join us, Dani.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.652
This is our new patient,
Danielle Moonstar.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.456
Oh, it's serious.

09:11.725 --> 09:14.361
Let's do our best
to make her feel at home.

09:14.995 --> 09:16.897
Go ahead, Rahne.

09:19.834 --> 09:20.835
Right.

09:22.436 --> 09:23.537
I was 13.

09:26.140 --> 09:28.475
I remember running
through the woods.

09:31.545 --> 09:32.980
<i>How did you feel?</i>

09:33.447 --> 09:34.615
Free.

09:35.950 --> 09:39.653
Like, the most free
I'd felt my whole life.

09:42.556 --> 09:44.391
But guilty, too.

09:46.060 --> 09:47.127
Why guilty?

09:49.430 --> 09:52.099
Because I knew it was bad.

09:54.568 --> 09:56.570
I went to Reverend Craig...

09:56.604 --> 09:58.539
to see if he could
pray it out of me.

09:59.773 --> 10:04.678
He asked me to show him,
so I changed.

10:04.712 --> 10:06.780
And what did Reverend Craig do?

10:10.150 --> 10:12.052
Beat me about half to death.

10:12.853 --> 10:14.555
Said I was a witch...

10:15.190 --> 10:17.992
that I was going to hell.

10:25.933 --> 10:28.702
Would anyone else like
to share their first time?

10:29.970 --> 10:31.438
New girl.

10:32.072 --> 10:33.707
How fucked up are you?

10:33.741 --> 10:35.943
- Illyana.
- Drugs, I bet.

10:35.976 --> 10:38.445
Or a nympho, maybe.
Hopefully.

10:38.479 --> 10:39.534
Keep behaving...

10:39.546 --> 10:40.569
exactly like you are
right now...

10:40.581 --> 10:42.917
and we can all just spend
the day in solitary.

10:45.653 --> 10:48.055
I want all of you
to think very carefully...

10:48.088 --> 10:50.124
about how you'd like to use
your time here.

10:51.792 --> 10:53.694
And how long
you want that time to be.

10:55.596 --> 10:57.765
Illyana,
since you're already up...

10:57.798 --> 10:59.533
why don't you show Dani around?

10:59.566 --> 11:01.068
And why do I have to?

11:02.770 --> 11:04.571
Because I'm asking you.

11:07.141 --> 11:08.909
How long have you been here?

11:10.778 --> 11:12.680
Are there any other doctors?

11:14.014 --> 11:15.516
- Why aren't you...
- Shh.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.619
What's that,
Lockheed?

11:21.121 --> 11:22.723
Oh, I know.

11:23.924 --> 11:25.526
I hate her, too.

11:35.002 --> 11:36.837
Dr. Reyes!

11:40.174 --> 11:42.576
Main building. Dorms.

11:42.609 --> 11:44.545
Chapel, if you believe
in that shit.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.580
And garden.

11:46.613 --> 11:48.582
You don't know how
to grow weed, do you?

11:48.615 --> 11:49.650
No.

11:50.718 --> 11:52.886
What kind of Indian are you?

11:53.587 --> 11:55.055
Cheyenne.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.725
I wasn't actually asking.

12:03.731 --> 12:05.132
You're my lookout.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.841
Where are we?

12:13.874 --> 12:15.576
Who knows?

12:15.609 --> 12:17.077
Dr. Reyes always says...

12:17.111 --> 12:19.513
the closest town
is 20 miles away.

12:20.647 --> 12:22.683
But she could be lying...

12:22.716 --> 12:24.852
to keep us
from trying to escape.

12:25.786 --> 12:26.887
There's no fence.

12:27.222 --> 12:28.555
Nope.

12:28.922 --> 12:30.291
No fence.

12:30.325 --> 12:34.195
Nothing between you and freedom.

12:41.668 --> 12:44.138
Run, new girl, run!

12:50.077 --> 12:51.078
Faster!

13:28.882 --> 13:31.952
Aw. This isn't a hospital,
Pocahontas.

13:33.654 --> 13:35.722
It's a cage.

13:35.756 --> 13:37.624
And now you're trapped
in it forever.

13:41.728 --> 13:44.232
Man, I really
should have warned you.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.337
- I have to go to help them.
- No! No, Dad, please!

14:22.370 --> 14:23.892
<i>Dani!
Please don't leave me alone!</i>

14:23.904 --> 14:25.827
<i>Survivor's guilt is
a common reaction to trauma.</i>

14:25.839 --> 14:27.741
Stay here!

14:27.774 --> 14:29.676
<i>You're the sole survivor.</i>

15:33.807 --> 15:35.167
What are you doing out here?

15:35.343 --> 15:37.110
Sorry.

15:37.144 --> 15:39.180
I didn't mean to scare you.

15:44.117 --> 15:47.488
Wow, this is really high up.

15:47.522 --> 15:49.490
A fall from here
would mess you up.

15:50.857 --> 15:52.092
It would kill me.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.161
Instantly.

15:54.195 --> 15:56.364
I wouldn't feel a thing.

15:57.365 --> 15:59.400
I want to get
out of here, too...

16:00.301 --> 16:02.169
but not like this.

16:03.904 --> 16:07.774
My home is gone.
My dad's dead.

16:09.109 --> 16:12.513
Where I'm from, we believe
suicides go straight to hell.

16:15.416 --> 16:18.286
Always kinda scared me
out of giving it a go.

16:18.319 --> 16:22.190
I don't wanna be here.
I wanna be with my family.

16:23.224 --> 16:26.827
If they're gone
and you're here...

16:26.860 --> 16:28.895
maybe it's for a reason.

16:28.929 --> 16:32.099
Maybe it's not time
to be with them just yet.

16:32.132 --> 16:33.934
But I'm all alone.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.006
There's two people up here.

16:41.376 --> 16:43.278
You calling me a nobody?

16:45.145 --> 16:47.014
Please.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.982
It's going to get better.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.520
I promise.

17:18.912 --> 17:21.147
Let's live a little longer,
Dani Moonstar.

17:24.385 --> 17:26.387
Dani, where were you?

17:28.155 --> 17:29.390
- Uh...
- I was just...

17:29.424 --> 17:31.158
showing her the chapel.

17:31.192 --> 17:32.959
No one is ever to be
unaccounted for, Rahne.

17:32.993 --> 17:34.027
You know that.

17:34.061 --> 17:35.463
I'm sorry,
Dr. Reyes.

17:36.331 --> 17:37.432
Okay.

17:40.234 --> 17:42.303
Did I just get you in trouble?

17:42.337 --> 17:44.238
It's okay.
She likes me.

17:44.272 --> 17:47.174
I'm one of the good ones.
Me and Sam.

17:57.050 --> 17:59.220
Holy shit,
I thought he just exploded.

17:59.253 --> 18:00.621
No.

18:00.655 --> 18:02.557
That's his thing.
He can blast off.

18:02.590 --> 18:05.193
Zero to 100 like a cannonball.

18:07.528 --> 18:09.297
Not so good at landing,
though.

18:09.330 --> 18:11.366
Is this,
like, practice?

18:12.266 --> 18:14.602
I don't know.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.157
Sometimes it seems
like he's out here...

18:16.169 --> 18:17.338
just trying to hurt himself.

18:20.541 --> 18:22.643
He grew up
in a small town in Kentucky.

18:22.677 --> 18:24.479
Did really well in school...

18:24.512 --> 18:26.947
but had to drop out to work
in the mines with his dad.

18:26.980 --> 18:29.082
Help the family and all.

18:29.116 --> 18:30.251
Poor guy.

18:30.284 --> 18:32.587
Right? Poor guy.

18:32.620 --> 18:35.055
And then there's Roberto.

18:35.088 --> 18:37.492
His family's, like,
the richest family in Brazil.

18:40.361 --> 18:41.928
Thanks, doggy.

18:41.962 --> 18:44.699
Probably living the sweet
life before he got here.

18:44.732 --> 18:46.967
Something must have
gone really wrong.

18:47.435 --> 18:49.102
What's his power?

18:49.136 --> 18:52.273
He won't tell,
but he's got something.

18:52.306 --> 18:54.275
Parents sent him here
to be cured.

18:54.308 --> 18:56.310
Is there a cure
for being an asshole?

18:56.344 --> 18:58.179
Maybe he's just the crazy one.

18:58.212 --> 19:00.681
No.
That spot's taken.

19:06.254 --> 19:07.954
Well, I really
enjoyed spending...

19:07.988 --> 19:10.425
the day with you, Dani,
but I should go.

19:10.458 --> 19:12.959
We're not supposed to be
in each other's rooms and...

19:12.993 --> 19:15.296
Why is she always watching us?

19:17.030 --> 19:19.132
For our own good.

19:19.166 --> 19:21.669
She means well.
She's trying to help us.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.372
If you follow the treatment,
you'll get out of here, Dani.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.041
Probably before
the rest of us cuckoos.

19:29.677 --> 19:31.679
Well, night.

19:33.281 --> 19:34.282
Rahne?

19:37.785 --> 19:39.620
Thank you for helping me.

19:40.354 --> 19:42.323
What do I know?

19:42.356 --> 19:44.325
Maybe we both
should have jumped.

20:13.421 --> 20:17.090
Dish duty is really
trimming down the wardrobe.

20:17.123 --> 20:19.092
Every time
your shirt gets dirty...

20:19.125 --> 20:21.127
you just throw it away?

20:23.331 --> 20:25.366
Here. It's all yours.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.101
Cool.

20:29.804 --> 20:31.205
Was it scary?

20:32.072 --> 20:33.307
Working in the mines?

20:34.742 --> 20:36.777
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

20:45.419 --> 20:47.153
<i>No!</i>

20:53.361 --> 20:54.462
Oh, Jesus.

20:54.495 --> 20:55.730
I got it.

20:58.199 --> 20:59.455
You couldn't pay me
a million dollars...

20:59.467 --> 21:01.736
to go in one of those things.

21:01.769 --> 21:04.170
I couldn't pay you a
million dollars anyway.

21:04.205 --> 21:06.274
When we get out of here,
I'll spot ya.

21:06.307 --> 21:07.408
My folks are good for it.

21:08.108 --> 21:09.544
Night, Kentucky.

21:09.577 --> 21:10.811
Night, man.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.392
Hello?

22:00.160 --> 22:01.429
Somebody!

23:00.488 --> 23:02.155
Dad?

23:03.858 --> 23:05.259
Samuel.

23:06.961 --> 23:08.796
What did you do?

23:49.737 --> 23:50.938
Oops.

24:04.351 --> 24:06.954
There aren't any cameras
in here, are there?

24:06.987 --> 24:09.557
Only safe place in the building.

24:09.590 --> 24:11.992
But there could
still be mics, so... Shh.

24:28.843 --> 24:32.379
Wow, that's, um...
That's some serious body art.

24:33.981 --> 24:36.283
Tattoo wasn't painful enough?

24:36.884 --> 24:38.753
It wasn't my idea.

24:40.921 --> 24:42.723
What's it stand for?

24:49.964 --> 24:52.266
I'm sorry. I don't want
to talk about it.

25:18.793 --> 25:20.027
<i>Control.</i>

25:27.802 --> 25:30.304
Control.

25:37.745 --> 25:40.047
Control.

25:47.154 --> 25:49.657
Control.

25:54.662 --> 25:57.097
Control.

26:00.701 --> 26:02.970
And...

26:06.106 --> 26:08.609
control.

26:08.642 --> 26:10.644
<i>Darling.
I can't do this.</i>

26:10.678 --> 26:13.414
I have one arm.
It takes two.

26:17.017 --> 26:18.652
<i>We can do this.</i>

26:22.423 --> 26:24.024
Hey, Standing Rock.

26:24.892 --> 26:26.760
You want a buffalo wing?

26:28.429 --> 26:30.564
You people love buffalo,
don't you?

26:30.598 --> 26:31.653
Jeez, Illya, will you just...

26:31.665 --> 26:32.900
- leave her alone?
- No.

26:33.701 --> 26:34.969
It's okay.

26:36.737 --> 26:40.174
"Standing Rock."
That's a good one.

26:40.208 --> 26:42.409
More original than "Pocahontas."

26:43.944 --> 26:46.046
That was huge in fifth grade.

26:47.147 --> 26:48.849
You don't scare me.

26:48.883 --> 26:51.151
My dad told me
about bitches like you.

26:51.186 --> 26:52.386
Oh.

26:54.555 --> 26:56.156
Well, here.

26:56.191 --> 26:57.691
Why don't you show us
on the puppet...

26:57.725 --> 26:58.826
where Daddy touched you?

27:00.228 --> 27:02.129
- Lockheed!
- Hey, guys, come on!

27:02.162 --> 27:04.765
You keep my father's name
out of your mouth, bitch!

27:06.834 --> 27:08.023
You don't know
anything about me.

27:08.035 --> 27:09.503
Do you know anything?

27:09.536 --> 27:11.705
Sixteen years old and
doesn't even know her power.

27:11.739 --> 27:13.528
Seems like that mutant period
should've kicked in by now.

27:13.540 --> 27:14.663
- Leave her alone.
- Yo. Hold up.

27:14.675 --> 27:16.477
I'm helping her.
This is therapy!

27:16.510 --> 27:19.680
- Get your hands off me.
- Or you'll what?

27:19.713 --> 27:22.217
Let's find out.
What are you gonna do, huh?

27:22.250 --> 27:24.752
Fuck! Bitch!

27:28.956 --> 27:30.591
Illyana, don't!

27:31.959 --> 27:33.560
You know the rules.

27:34.161 --> 27:35.663
No powers in here.

27:35.696 --> 27:36.830
And definitely no fighting.

27:40.601 --> 27:42.703
Sorry, Doctor.

27:42.736 --> 27:44.672
I thought maybe Dani
was invincible.

27:45.940 --> 27:47.942
Just wanted to see
if I was right.

27:47.975 --> 27:50.044
Solitary. Both of you.

27:50.077 --> 27:51.478
But it wasn't Dani's...

27:51.512 --> 27:54.615
Everyone else,
lights out in 10.

27:57.885 --> 27:59.920
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Mmm.

28:00.788 --> 28:02.523
I'll see you in hell.

28:06.060 --> 28:07.494
Come on.

28:15.903 --> 28:17.638
What's that, Lockheed?

28:18.639 --> 28:20.208
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

28:23.944 --> 28:26.480
We'll go to our
special place, okay?

28:29.184 --> 28:32.486
The Smiling Men can't get us
in our special place.

30:08.183 --> 30:09.184
Dani?

30:12.152 --> 30:13.987
What's happening to me?

30:30.771 --> 30:32.739
You're clearly
manifesting something...

30:32.773 --> 30:35.843
but we need to do more tests
to find out what it is.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.979
It's okay.
I'm a doctor.

30:39.012 --> 30:41.815
Actually, I come from
a family of doctors.

30:41.849 --> 30:43.351
My mother was a vet.

30:44.818 --> 30:47.388
A lot of pets came in
with rattlesnake bites.

30:48.989 --> 30:52.260
Did you know baby rattlesnakes
are more dangerous...

30:52.293 --> 30:55.028
than adult ones?

30:55.062 --> 30:56.864
They haven't learned
how to control...

30:56.897 --> 30:59.166
how much venom they secrete.

30:59.200 --> 31:02.203
Even the mutants
we call heroes today...

31:02.237 --> 31:04.771
when they first
got their powers...

31:04.805 --> 31:06.640
chances are they hurt someone.

31:07.841 --> 31:10.311
That's why new mutants
are dangerous.

31:11.778 --> 31:14.081
- And they need to be...
- Locked up?

31:15.949 --> 31:18.286
Sequestered...

31:18.319 --> 31:22.689
from average humans,
for their safety and ours.

31:24.825 --> 31:25.826
Put pressure.

31:51.386 --> 31:54.355
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

31:56.191 --> 31:58.259
It's been a week
since my last confession.

31:58.293 --> 32:01.895
My superior runs
a facility for gifted mutants.

32:01.929 --> 32:04.765
You could move there after
this, if you wanted to.

32:04.798 --> 32:07.067
Rahne said I could even
get out of here faster...

32:07.100 --> 32:08.936
if I follow your program.

32:09.870 --> 32:11.138
I've noticed you and Rahne...

32:11.171 --> 32:13.374
have taken a liking
to each other.

32:13.408 --> 32:16.109
That's good.
She's a good influence.

32:17.110 --> 32:18.812
And she's right.

32:18.845 --> 32:22.816
It's important we find out
exactly what your power is...

32:22.849 --> 32:24.818
so we can help you control it.

32:28.289 --> 32:30.191
I masturbated twice.

32:31.058 --> 32:33.428
I lied to Dr. Reyes.

32:33.461 --> 32:35.296
And I was up in the vents again.

32:40.501 --> 32:41.802
Hello?

32:46.006 --> 32:48.809
I'm gonna say one Our Father
and two Hail Marys, okay?

32:53.281 --> 32:54.382
Hello?

33:06.461 --> 33:07.528
Who's there?

33:08.296 --> 33:09.297
<i>Witch!</i>

33:11.332 --> 33:12.467
<i>You witch!</i>

33:12.500 --> 33:14.034
<i>I'll flay the flesh</i>

33:14.067 --> 33:16.371
<i>from your bones!</i>

33:16.404 --> 33:18.105
Demons can't come in churches.

33:18.138 --> 33:19.806
Demons can't come in churches.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.442
Demons can't come in churches.

33:30.418 --> 33:32.253
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:32.287 --> 33:33.887
Where have you been?

33:35.423 --> 33:37.090
Are you okay?

33:37.425 --> 33:39.159
Yeah.

33:39.193 --> 33:40.961
Just needed some time to myself.

33:40.994 --> 33:42.029
Come on.

33:43.197 --> 33:45.300
Where are you guys going?

33:45.333 --> 33:47.067
Reyes is asleep,
so we're going up to the...

33:47.100 --> 33:48.969
To the "never mind,
you're not invited."

33:49.002 --> 33:50.538
Come on, Illy.

33:50.571 --> 33:52.172
Come on,
we'll show you.

33:54.208 --> 33:55.410
Whatever.

34:05.386 --> 34:07.854
So, you guys hang out
in an attic?

34:07.888 --> 34:09.290
Yeah.

34:09.324 --> 34:11.458
It's one of the only places
Reyes can't watch us.

34:11.492 --> 34:12.514
It's full of cool shit...

34:12.527 --> 34:15.228
from back before this was even
a place for mutants.

34:15.263 --> 34:17.465
Let's play a little game.

34:30.911 --> 34:32.145
Dare.

34:32.179 --> 34:33.447
You can't say dare.

34:34.081 --> 34:36.317
Fine. Jesus.

34:37.618 --> 34:38.952
Truth.

34:42.089 --> 34:43.956
How many girls
have you been with?

34:43.989 --> 34:45.891
Like I can even remember.

34:47.195 --> 34:48.262
Rahne?

34:50.097 --> 34:51.098
He's lying.

34:52.333 --> 34:55.469
It's a lie detector.
We know.

34:56.270 --> 34:58.105
Fine. Three.

34:58.138 --> 34:59.973
That's not bad.

35:03.076 --> 35:04.612
No, look.

35:04.645 --> 35:06.514
- I told you.
- What?

35:06.547 --> 35:07.948
Why not?

35:08.483 --> 35:10.418
I get too hot.

35:11.519 --> 35:15.021
Yeah, you think it's funny?
Your turn, asshole.

35:23.231 --> 35:25.031
What's the coal for?

35:26.267 --> 35:27.535
My dad gave it to me.

35:28.669 --> 35:30.170
Right before...

35:32.507 --> 35:34.007
he passed.

35:35.075 --> 35:36.377
I'm sorry.

35:37.712 --> 35:39.045
Don't be.

35:41.148 --> 35:43.016
I belong here, so...

35:43.049 --> 35:45.720
I'm not sure
any of us belong here.

35:45.753 --> 35:47.355
I think I do.

35:47.988 --> 35:50.090
Why?

35:50.123 --> 35:52.226
New girl,
he already had his question.

35:52.260 --> 35:53.561
It's your turn.

35:55.229 --> 35:56.963
Aren't you gonna hook me up?

35:56.997 --> 35:59.600
I don't need a polygraph
to tell if you're lying.

36:03.538 --> 36:04.539
What's your power?

36:06.574 --> 36:08.242
I don't know.

36:08.276 --> 36:10.745
I thought you were
going to say that.

36:10.778 --> 36:12.979
How about another question?

36:13.013 --> 36:15.015
What's with the stupid bear?

36:16.651 --> 36:18.186
Same as Sam.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.322
My dad made it for me.

36:23.591 --> 36:24.725
Why?

36:26.294 --> 36:28.429
When I was little,
I was...

36:31.064 --> 36:33.501
I was really afraid of the dark.

36:33.534 --> 36:35.570
Like, so afraid,
it was impossible...

36:35.603 --> 36:37.338
to get me to go to bed.

36:37.371 --> 36:41.742
So my dad, he told me
a legend of a bear.

36:43.311 --> 36:45.680
A Demon Bear...

36:45.713 --> 36:50.384
that lives inside of us
and feeds off of our fear.

36:50.418 --> 36:52.186
That'll help a kid sleep.

36:52.220 --> 36:53.721
Shut up, Berto.

36:55.289 --> 36:56.990
So, when you're born...

36:57.658 --> 37:01.496
the bear is tiny and weak.

37:03.397 --> 37:05.131
And the older you get...

37:06.667 --> 37:10.003
the more afraid we become...

37:11.672 --> 37:14.442
the bigger and the stronger
the bear gets.

37:17.512 --> 37:19.079
My dad, he...

37:21.382 --> 37:23.502
he made this for me so that
I would always remember...

37:23.518 --> 37:26.119
how small it was
when I was born.

37:28.256 --> 37:30.725
So that I would remember
to never be afraid.

37:34.595 --> 37:35.596
Enough.

37:36.497 --> 37:37.532
Let's do this.

37:46.207 --> 37:47.608
Well, come on.

37:50.545 --> 37:52.380
Truth.

37:52.413 --> 37:54.348
Why are you here?

37:55.516 --> 37:57.685
Because I killed 18 men.

37:59.720 --> 38:02.256
One by one.

38:03.824 --> 38:05.793
With my sword.

38:05.826 --> 38:07.628
<i>And Lockheed.</i>

38:07.662 --> 38:09.196
<i>You're lying.</i>

38:09.230 --> 38:10.464
<i>No, she's not.</i>

38:10.498 --> 38:12.233
<i>You don't believe me?</i>

38:13.901 --> 38:17.338
<i>I'm the most powerful
mutant here.</i>

38:17.371 --> 38:19.707
Today, I'd like to talk
about obedience.

38:21.509 --> 38:23.143
If you want any hope
of moving on...

38:23.176 --> 38:24.879
to my superior's facility...

38:24.912 --> 38:28.114
it's crucial that I know
you can be trusted.

38:30.785 --> 38:31.852
Yes?

38:31.886 --> 38:35.289
What if we don't wanna move on
to your boss's facility?

38:35.323 --> 38:37.191
You know, what if
I just wanna go home?

38:37.224 --> 38:40.628
Sam, you remember what happened.

38:40.661 --> 38:43.698
You think they stopped
looking for you?

38:43.731 --> 38:47.568
If you weren't here,
you'd be in prison or worse.

38:47.602 --> 38:49.537
I was...
It was an accident.

38:49.570 --> 38:51.393
You think anyone outside
this room would believe that?

38:51.405 --> 38:53.608
I would.
Sam is a good guy.

38:53.641 --> 38:55.876
Even if I'm not...

38:55.910 --> 38:57.511
do I really have to spend...

38:57.545 --> 38:59.180
my whole life in here
for one mistake?

38:59.213 --> 39:00.348
Once you're better...

39:00.381 --> 39:01.716
When am I better?

39:01.749 --> 39:03.517
What's gotten into you, Sam?

39:03.551 --> 39:05.386
Look,
something's not right.

39:05.419 --> 39:07.855
I'm seeing things,
terrible nightmares.

39:08.489 --> 39:09.690
Uh...

39:09.724 --> 39:11.726
When will I ever get better?

39:11.759 --> 39:14.462
You're better when I say so.

39:14.495 --> 39:15.863
No, forget it.
It's bullshit.

39:15.896 --> 39:17.398
You're not listening to me.

39:46.827 --> 39:48.829
What did you do to her?

39:48.863 --> 39:51.465
I may have spiked her tea.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.249
Hold those bag of bones
together, man!

40:08.282 --> 40:09.316
Whoa!

40:19.927 --> 40:21.262
Whoo!

40:21.295 --> 40:23.798
Indubitably,
it's indisputable...

40:23.831 --> 40:27.668
that you are the absolute
worst mutants I've ever seen.

40:27.702 --> 40:31.906
Ergo, my superior will be
very, very disappointed in me.

40:31.939 --> 40:34.809
I surmise I may even
receive a spanking...

40:34.842 --> 40:36.444
for being so, so bad.

40:36.477 --> 40:38.446
Oh. Oh, my superior!

40:39.647 --> 40:42.483
Yeah, who is this superior
she's always talking about?

40:42.950 --> 40:44.318
Isn't it obvious?

40:45.820 --> 40:46.875
You know who
the X-Men are, right?

40:46.887 --> 40:50.324
Yeah. It's just,
why would we wanna be X-Men?

40:50.357 --> 40:52.760
Right. I ain't wearing no suit
and fighting people. I'm rich.

40:52.793 --> 40:54.595
What, they pay you
to be X-Men now?

40:54.628 --> 40:56.497
I wouldn't mind being an X-Man.

40:56.530 --> 40:57.965
And why would they need a dog?

41:02.870 --> 41:04.338
Children.

41:06.474 --> 41:08.434
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

41:08.676 --> 41:09.944
Where?

41:09.977 --> 41:11.378
It's a surprise.

41:18.085 --> 41:19.720
What are those two up to?

41:20.921 --> 41:21.989
Cheers.

41:23.657 --> 41:25.960
Rahne, wait.

41:25.993 --> 41:27.728
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

41:27.762 --> 41:29.830
Yeah. I can see in the dark.

41:29.864 --> 41:32.266
Just follow me.

41:35.870 --> 41:36.925
<i>You know how much trouble...</i>

41:36.937 --> 41:38.057
<i>we're gonna get in for this?</i>

41:40.975 --> 41:43.811
What's she gonna do?
Kick us out?

41:45.479 --> 41:47.381
I don't wanna be here anyway.

41:47.782 --> 41:49.016
Yeah.

41:49.049 --> 41:50.918
But as long as Dr. Phil
has her magic bubble...

41:50.951 --> 41:52.586
over the grounds...

41:52.620 --> 41:54.021
you don't have a choice.

41:54.822 --> 41:56.056
Yeah.

41:56.957 --> 41:59.293
I never did have a choice.

42:00.528 --> 42:01.962
What do you mean?

42:06.801 --> 42:09.737
You know, I had to go and
work in the mines with my dad.

42:12.706 --> 42:15.075
I was still new to the job.

42:15.109 --> 42:17.344
And this one day,
I just...

42:19.914 --> 42:22.616
I just got claustrophobic.

42:22.650 --> 42:25.452
Like I couldn't breathe.
It was...

42:26.086 --> 42:27.988
And he blasted.

42:29.824 --> 42:30.891
Yeah.

42:35.896 --> 42:37.631
I killed my dad.

42:40.167 --> 42:41.836
Most of his crew.

42:44.538 --> 42:47.575
I just... I just couldn't
forgive myself.

42:47.608 --> 42:49.543
I'm sorry, man.
I didn't...

42:49.577 --> 42:50.744
Just kept thinking...

42:52.513 --> 42:55.049
I would do anything
to change that.

43:01.155 --> 43:02.857
What about you?

43:02.890 --> 43:04.458
What did you do?

43:07.494 --> 43:08.662
Nothing.

43:28.449 --> 43:30.417
Wait, so you could get out
of the building...

43:30.451 --> 43:31.619
this whole time?

43:31.652 --> 43:33.153
I can get anywhere
in the hospital...

43:33.188 --> 43:34.555
through the vents.

43:34.588 --> 43:36.790
This is the only
way out, though.

43:36.824 --> 43:39.426
I'm always paranoid
Reyes is gonna find it.

43:39.460 --> 43:41.428
Yeah, she's gonna
find out a lot tomorrow.

43:41.462 --> 43:43.430
Trust me. This is worth it.

43:48.102 --> 43:49.603
Come on,
lay down.

44:04.785 --> 44:06.487
Oh, my God.

44:11.825 --> 44:13.560
Isn't that beautiful?

44:14.595 --> 44:15.829
Yeah.

44:16.563 --> 44:17.731
It is.

44:18.732 --> 44:20.567
It's our beautiful cage.

44:22.102 --> 44:24.505
That's what my father called it.

44:26.540 --> 44:29.443
You had a dome
over your reservation?

44:32.680 --> 44:33.948
No.

44:36.617 --> 44:39.720
He meant our bodies.

44:42.690 --> 44:43.857
Like...

44:44.925 --> 44:47.228
how we're trapped in them.

44:48.162 --> 44:50.965
And at death,
our souls are free.

44:52.833 --> 44:55.203
Free to be
with the ones you love.

44:57.638 --> 44:59.707
Sounds pretty nice, honestly.

45:38.279 --> 45:40.781
Sorry, I thought I heard you...

45:43.684 --> 45:45.019
Want company?

45:45.719 --> 45:47.322
Fine.

45:47.355 --> 45:50.591
But you have to turn off
the lights.

45:51.859 --> 45:52.993
Sure.

45:56.697 --> 45:58.098
Ooh, scary.

45:58.132 --> 45:59.633
Are you scared?

45:59.666 --> 46:00.768
No.

46:01.735 --> 46:03.271
I think you are.

46:04.305 --> 46:05.672
Virgin.

46:07.342 --> 46:08.909
You have to catch me.

46:09.676 --> 46:11.011
Hey, wait.

46:16.650 --> 46:18.786
Doesn't feel like it's real.

46:21.722 --> 46:24.691
Sometimes it doesn't feel
like you're real.

46:26.394 --> 46:28.162
What do you mean?

46:34.034 --> 46:35.769
It's just that...

46:37.372 --> 46:39.640
you're just so nice to me.

46:41.376 --> 46:43.710
Too nice.

46:43.744 --> 46:46.181
Sometimes I feel like
I made you up.

46:52.320 --> 46:54.755
You didn't make me up.

46:54.788 --> 46:56.757
I promise you, I'm real.

47:18.213 --> 47:19.847
Your eyes.

47:20.914 --> 47:22.317
Oh.

47:22.350 --> 47:23.884
I'm sorry.

47:23.917 --> 47:25.119
Don't.

47:26.687 --> 47:28.189
They're beautiful.

47:32.693 --> 47:36.297
I've never done this before.

47:36.864 --> 47:38.799
With a girl?

47:39.133 --> 47:40.801
With anyone.

48:00.188 --> 48:01.722
What's wrong?

48:06.427 --> 48:10.265
I can't. I just need
a second to cool down.

48:11.131 --> 48:12.866
Isn't this what you want?

48:13.934 --> 48:15.403
Yeah. It's...

48:16.937 --> 48:18.373
I can't get too hot.

48:19.507 --> 48:21.708
If I get too hot, I...

48:24.144 --> 48:25.879
You can tell me.

48:27.382 --> 48:29.317
I was with my girlfriend.

48:34.021 --> 48:35.323
I tried to hold her...

48:37.824 --> 48:40.395
but I burned her with my...

48:40.428 --> 48:43.063
- I killed her with my hands.
- Hey.

48:43.096 --> 48:44.731
- I burned her.
- Hey.

48:45.165 --> 48:46.700
Look at me.

48:48.969 --> 48:50.704
You can't burn me.

48:52.373 --> 48:54.209
You won't hurt me.

48:56.511 --> 48:57.811
But...

48:59.180 --> 49:01.715
you do need to catch me again.

49:12.493 --> 49:13.760
<i>Illy?</i>

49:22.337 --> 49:23.504
Illy?

49:45.092 --> 49:46.860
Mariella! No!

49:57.871 --> 49:58.939
What is it?

49:59.474 --> 50:00.508
It's Berto.

50:10.184 --> 50:12.387
Control room, unlock.

50:20.093 --> 50:22.062
What's going on?
Go back to your room.

50:50.425 --> 50:53.227
Damn. What happened here?

50:57.298 --> 50:58.366
What?

50:59.367 --> 51:00.501
What's the code, huh?

51:00.535 --> 51:02.236
Give me my phone back.

51:02.270 --> 51:03.937
I am in charge here.

51:03.970 --> 51:05.606
You're not in charge of shit.

51:05.640 --> 51:08.543
Did you not see what happened?
Huh? Illyana tried to kill me.

51:08.576 --> 51:10.077
It wasn't me.

51:10.110 --> 51:11.367
Roberto, Illyana was
in her room.

51:11.379 --> 51:12.213
Bullshit!

51:12.246 --> 51:14.915
There was nobody
in the pool but you.

51:14.948 --> 51:17.251
Did you see what I saw? Huh?

51:17.285 --> 51:18.407
We're trapped in here
with demons...

51:18.419 --> 51:19.475
and you want us to stay trapped!

51:19.487 --> 51:20.887
- Give it back.
- What's the code?

51:20.921 --> 51:22.557
- Hey! Berto, chill.
- Chill nothing.

51:22.590 --> 51:24.079
I'm calling the cops
and getting out of here.

51:24.091 --> 51:25.926
- You're not going anywhere.
- Yeah? Says who?

51:25.959 --> 51:26.993
Says your doctor.

51:27.027 --> 51:28.895
Bullshit.

51:30.130 --> 51:31.399
You're not a doctor.

51:33.668 --> 51:36.169
I've known men like you.

51:36.204 --> 51:38.506
Men who like to keep children
trapped in cages.

51:39.172 --> 51:41.242
I've known them...

51:41.275 --> 51:43.009
and I've killed them.

51:44.044 --> 51:46.180
She wasn't in the pool.

51:48.148 --> 51:50.618
But I know what you did to me.

51:50.651 --> 51:53.920
You're gonna help the others
clean this mess.

51:53.954 --> 51:56.089
In your dreams.

51:59.694 --> 52:01.362
Let me out of here!

52:01.396 --> 52:03.331
Damn it!
I am not dying in here!

52:03.364 --> 52:04.553
Do you understand me?

52:04.565 --> 52:06.099
Let me out!

52:06.133 --> 52:07.502
Initiate lockdown.

52:14.275 --> 52:16.977
Today, Dani, we're
going to go a little deeper.

52:17.010 --> 52:18.212
Clench your fist.

52:19.580 --> 52:21.182
This will relax you.

52:35.329 --> 52:37.998
I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

52:39.065 --> 52:41.402
I want you
to respond truthfully.

52:41.436 --> 52:43.304
What's the last thing
you remember...

52:43.337 --> 52:45.239
before coming here?

52:50.478 --> 52:52.313
My dad woke me up.

52:52.346 --> 52:54.147
He said we had to run.

52:55.316 --> 52:56.651
And everything was shaking.

52:56.684 --> 52:58.352
What were you running from?

52:59.487 --> 53:01.389
He said it was a tornado.

53:01.422 --> 53:04.124
We both know
it wasn't a tornado, Dani.

53:04.157 --> 53:06.059
What were you running from?

53:08.696 --> 53:10.498
It was snowing.

53:10.531 --> 53:11.666
In the summertime?

53:12.800 --> 53:14.368
It brings the snow.

53:16.471 --> 53:17.672
What does?

53:22.610 --> 53:24.110
The Demon Bear.

53:29.217 --> 53:30.384
Where are you?

53:30.418 --> 53:32.186
I'm right here, Dani.

53:35.289 --> 53:36.757
What is this place?

53:40.361 --> 53:41.429
What are you doing?

53:41.462 --> 53:42.463
Dani?

53:45.131 --> 53:47.033
No! No! No!

54:25.239 --> 54:26.474
Hello?

54:27.475 --> 54:30.278
Dani?
Who's there?

54:37.685 --> 54:39.220
You're not real.

54:40.254 --> 54:42.088
I killed you.

54:42.122 --> 54:46.427
And like Christ, I rise again.

54:46.460 --> 54:48.195
Stay away from me!

54:50.231 --> 54:52.233
Lockheed, what's going on?

54:55.636 --> 54:57.371
It's her.

54:58.472 --> 55:00.474
Focus, Dani!

55:00.508 --> 55:01.709
Can you control it?

55:03.411 --> 55:05.413
Nobody can.

55:21.429 --> 55:22.463
No!

55:45.920 --> 55:47.221
Stay back!

55:55.229 --> 55:56.330
Rahne!

56:00.635 --> 56:01.936
Oh, my God.

56:01.969 --> 56:04.372
Is that real?
That's real.

56:04.405 --> 56:05.561
See, I told you.
This shit's real.

56:05.573 --> 56:07.173
What happened to her?

56:07.208 --> 56:08.743
You happened.

56:10.478 --> 56:11.579
It's Dani.

56:13.514 --> 56:15.316
It's all Dani.

56:15.349 --> 56:16.484
I didn't do anything.

56:16.517 --> 56:18.252
You brought this evil here!

56:20.254 --> 56:22.757
I now know your power,
new girl.

56:25.960 --> 56:28.429
Let me show you mine.

56:28.462 --> 56:29.662
Illyana, no powers!

56:41.742 --> 56:42.977
Don't!

56:51.452 --> 56:53.521
She's in our heads.

56:53.554 --> 56:55.389
She'll kill us all.

57:34.962 --> 57:38.499
Something's happening
to me, and I can't control it.

57:45.473 --> 57:47.308
That place you took me...

57:50.377 --> 57:51.579
Was it hell?

57:56.083 --> 57:59.420
Limbo. It's a place
we made up.

57:59.987 --> 58:01.288
"We"?

58:02.056 --> 58:03.591
Me and Lockheed.

58:10.064 --> 58:11.966
I brought someone for you.

58:30.518 --> 58:33.454
At first, it was just
our special place.

58:35.589 --> 58:36.891
We went there in our minds...

58:36.924 --> 58:39.493
whenever something bad
was about to happen.

58:43.664 --> 58:45.666
But we went there so much...

58:48.002 --> 58:49.937
stayed there so long...

58:52.640 --> 58:54.074
it became real.

58:54.108 --> 58:55.142
I saw a memory.

58:59.013 --> 59:00.848
It wasn't mine.

59:05.653 --> 59:07.688
Who were they?

59:07.721 --> 59:09.824
I never knew their names.

59:09.857 --> 59:11.725
They were all the same.

59:15.663 --> 59:17.665
They made us cry.

59:23.804 --> 59:25.973
And it made them smile.

01:00:19.493 --> 01:00:20.694
How's the pain?

01:00:20.728 --> 01:00:22.429
Drugs are helping.

01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:25.532
Was it really him?

01:00:25.566 --> 01:00:26.967
Preacher?

01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:29.670
If he wasn't real,
he could've fooled me.

01:00:34.209 --> 01:00:35.776
Why won't you come in?

01:00:38.746 --> 01:00:40.614
I'm not afraid of you.

01:00:44.785 --> 01:00:46.620
I'm afraid of what I saw.

01:00:46.654 --> 01:00:47.922
Of him.

01:00:51.992 --> 01:00:54.195
But what if he only came
because of me?

01:00:57.498 --> 01:01:00.801
Even if you are the one
making these things happen...

01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:05.072
you had no choice.

01:01:05.105 --> 01:01:06.941
It's not your fault.

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:12.947
I saw something when
Dr. Reyes was testing me.

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:15.516
I saw kids like us.

01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:18.719
Mutants, being forced
to do things.

01:01:21.189 --> 01:01:22.723
Horrible things.

01:01:27.962 --> 01:01:31.165
I don't
think this is a hospital.

01:01:31.199 --> 01:01:33.834
The place that I saw,
I think that's where we go...

01:01:33.867 --> 01:01:35.703
when we leave.

01:01:37.071 --> 01:01:39.207
If we leave.

01:01:41.075 --> 01:01:42.676
I'm ready for you, Dani.

01:01:45.679 --> 01:01:46.680
Wait.
I have to go.

01:01:47.614 --> 01:01:48.716
What if you're right?

01:01:48.749 --> 01:01:51.018
Are you just gonna let her
pump you full of drugs again?

01:01:51.051 --> 01:01:54.088
Last time,
I saw things, secrets.

01:01:55.756 --> 01:01:57.725
Maybe I will again.

01:01:57.758 --> 01:01:59.994
Maybe those secrets will help
us find a way out of here.

01:02:00.027 --> 01:02:01.528
How?

01:02:01.562 --> 01:02:03.063
I don't know yet.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.101
But let's live a bit longer,
Rahne Sinclair.

01:02:24.018 --> 01:02:25.853
Dani wanted me to stay with her.

01:02:25.886 --> 01:02:27.222
I need you to
wait outside, Rahne.

01:02:27.255 --> 01:02:28.256
I know, but...

01:02:28.289 --> 01:02:29.929
You can come back for recovery.

01:02:38.866 --> 01:02:40.901
Doors. Hallway H.

01:03:07.661 --> 01:03:09.230
Hey.
What's up with you?

01:03:10.298 --> 01:03:11.732
Nothing.

01:03:13.901 --> 01:03:15.069
It's just...

01:03:16.136 --> 01:03:18.072
Well, Reyes was...

01:03:19.907 --> 01:03:21.675
Reyes was what?

01:03:24.812 --> 01:03:25.846
You guys hear that?

01:03:30.084 --> 01:03:31.652
Is that music?

01:03:37.825 --> 01:03:39.360
I know that song.

01:03:41.929 --> 01:03:42.930
Wait.

01:03:45.266 --> 01:03:47.668
What are we testing this time?

01:03:48.436 --> 01:03:50.871
This is more a test of me.

01:03:54.108 --> 01:03:57.177
I told you
my mother was a vet, right?

01:03:57.212 --> 01:03:59.214
One day
our family dog went feral...

01:04:01.148 --> 01:04:03.050
mauled the neighbor's boy.

01:04:03.684 --> 01:04:04.952
Lift your head.

01:04:06.187 --> 01:04:07.188
Down.

01:04:10.757 --> 01:04:12.092
It was rabies.

01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:16.964
It's coming from my room.

01:04:21.469 --> 01:04:22.970
I'm going
to get Dr. Reyes.

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:26.874
Illyana, don't!

01:04:33.448 --> 01:04:36.384
What the hell is this place?

01:04:37.985 --> 01:04:39.019
No.

01:04:40.255 --> 01:04:41.755
No, I buried this.

01:04:52.433 --> 01:04:54.402
Stay away from her,
you pig!

01:04:57.938 --> 01:05:00.707
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:05:00.741 --> 01:05:02.109
Look. Look at me.

01:05:02.142 --> 01:05:04.077
Listen to me.
He cannot hurt you.

01:05:04.111 --> 01:05:05.846
No! Don't!

01:05:07.014 --> 01:05:09.783
Look, see? He's not real.
All right?

01:05:12.953 --> 01:05:14.021
Go! Run!

01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:17.225
Run!

01:05:17.258 --> 01:05:19.427
My mother tried everything.

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.296
It was too far along.

01:05:22.996 --> 01:05:24.798
I can't tell you
how hard it is...

01:05:24.831 --> 01:05:27.000
for a doctor to face that, Dani.

01:05:30.804 --> 01:05:32.139
That powerlessness.

01:05:37.412 --> 01:05:40.047
You can do your best
to save a patient...

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:43.218
but sometimes
the most humane thing to do...

01:05:43.251 --> 01:05:45.085
is put it to sleep.

01:05:46.887 --> 01:05:48.289
Help!

01:05:48.956 --> 01:05:50.724
Help!

01:05:51.792 --> 01:05:53.328
Help!

01:05:57.164 --> 01:05:58.832
Help me!

01:06:03.571 --> 01:06:05.772
Help me!

01:06:10.411 --> 01:06:12.012
All right. It's okay.

01:06:13.548 --> 01:06:14.881
Oh, Jesus!

01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:17.918
Get away! Stop!

01:06:19.019 --> 01:06:21.788
Get off me! Let me go!

01:06:21.822 --> 01:06:23.224
No! Stop!

01:06:24.891 --> 01:06:27.127
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:06:58.626 --> 01:07:00.316
You're
the most powerful mutant...

01:07:00.328 --> 01:07:01.928
we've ever had.

01:07:01.962 --> 01:07:05.533
But my superiors believe your
powers cannot be controlled.

01:07:07.468 --> 01:07:09.270
It's almost over, Dani.

01:07:36.264 --> 01:07:37.265
Dani?

01:07:42.503 --> 01:07:43.504
Dani?

01:07:45.473 --> 01:07:46.907
Dani, wake up.

01:07:56.417 --> 01:07:57.951
Hey, Dr. Reyes!

01:07:57.984 --> 01:07:59.554
Thank God.
You gotta help us!

01:08:00.488 --> 01:08:02.122
Hey!

01:08:02.155 --> 01:08:03.391
Dr. Reyes!

01:08:13.967 --> 01:08:16.069
I love you, Lockheed.
We're gonna die.

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:18.971
Come on, Illyana.
You gotta do something.

01:08:19.005 --> 01:08:20.640
- I can't.
- Use your powers.

01:08:20.675 --> 01:08:22.142
I can't!

01:08:22.175 --> 01:08:24.479
Illyana, do something!

01:08:27.715 --> 01:08:29.649
Oh, seriously?

01:08:48.368 --> 01:08:50.571
Hey, Berto! Berto!

01:08:53.741 --> 01:08:55.710
Bitch put force fields
over all the exits.

01:08:55.743 --> 01:08:57.645
Is she trying to kill us?

01:08:57.678 --> 01:08:59.167
Don't know. Did she make
those smiley things?

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.947
No. They're Illyana's.

01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:02.082
Of course they are.

01:09:02.115 --> 01:09:03.384
Have you seen the girls?

01:09:03.417 --> 01:09:04.452
No.

01:09:04.484 --> 01:09:06.287
All right. Upstairs.

01:09:22.303 --> 01:09:24.171
Where the hell did you go?

01:09:26.741 --> 01:09:28.609
Our special place.

01:09:31.011 --> 01:09:32.479
That was so hot.

01:09:46.761 --> 01:09:49.397
What the hell's going on?
Where's Dr. Reyes?

01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:50.765
She tried to kill Dani.

01:09:50.798 --> 01:09:52.032
What?

01:09:52.064 --> 01:09:54.268
That test?
It wasn't a test.

01:09:54.301 --> 01:09:56.270
She tried to kill her.

01:09:56.304 --> 01:09:57.605
My file.

01:09:59.105 --> 01:10:01.776
"Patient reviles authority."

01:10:01.809 --> 01:10:04.345
"But her fragmented psyche
and base hatred for humans..."

01:10:04.378 --> 01:10:06.514
"Makes her a prime
candidate for the program."

01:10:07.582 --> 01:10:08.982
"Conclusion..."

01:10:09.784 --> 01:10:11.185
"A killer..."

01:10:12.152 --> 01:10:14.255
"With limitless potential."

01:10:15.323 --> 01:10:17.592
"Recommend
continued investment."

01:10:24.799 --> 01:10:26.734
Essex Corporation.

01:10:26.767 --> 01:10:28.703
That must have been
the place I saw.

01:10:28.736 --> 01:10:31.305
She wasn't
prepping us to be X-Men.

01:10:31.339 --> 01:10:32.773
She was prepping us
to be killers.

01:10:34.208 --> 01:10:35.643
We don't have much time.

01:10:35.676 --> 01:10:37.445
Reyes wants me dead.
And it won't be long...

01:10:37.478 --> 01:10:39.447
before she comes back
to finish the job.

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.617
How? This place is designed
to keep us inside.

01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:45.051
All our powers, it won't work.
It's hopeless.

01:10:45.085 --> 01:10:47.321
No. It isn't.

01:10:47.355 --> 01:10:49.724
We got each other
out of our cages.

01:10:51.459 --> 01:10:52.693
We can get out of this.

01:10:52.727 --> 01:10:54.428
That's all well and good.

01:10:54.462 --> 01:10:55.751
But she's still got
force fields...

01:10:55.763 --> 01:10:57.163
around the building.

01:10:57.832 --> 01:11:01.235
The windows, everything.

01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:04.104
How you gonna get past that?

01:11:05.339 --> 01:11:07.308
By taking out the source.

01:11:10.143 --> 01:11:12.145
Then let's kill the bitch.

01:11:20.555 --> 01:11:21.577
<i>Tonight...</i>

01:11:21.589 --> 01:11:24.759
<i>I'd like to talk
about responsibility.</i>

01:11:25.993 --> 01:11:29.664
<i>You have a responsibility
to your treatment.</i>

01:11:29.697 --> 01:11:32.400
<i>I want all of you to go
to your rooms right now.</i>

01:11:32.433 --> 01:11:36.804
<i>If you disobey,
or if you try to leave this facility...</i>

01:11:36.837 --> 01:11:39.473
<i>I have a responsibility
to stop you.</i>

01:11:40.441 --> 01:11:42.443
<i>No matter what it takes.</i>

01:11:45.913 --> 01:11:48.249
How do you know
she's still in here?

01:11:48.749 --> 01:11:50.618
I'm a good smeller.

01:11:50.651 --> 01:11:52.653
<i>You're a good killer.</i>

01:11:52.687 --> 01:11:54.221
What's going on?

01:11:55.356 --> 01:11:57.358
What's Essex Corp?

01:12:05.766 --> 01:12:10.605
It's a scientific organization
founded by my superiors.

01:12:10.638 --> 01:12:13.808
Founded to do what?
Screw with our heads?

01:12:13.841 --> 01:12:14.842
To save you!

01:12:17.778 --> 01:12:19.313
If it wasn't for me...

01:12:19.347 --> 01:12:21.682
you all would've been dead
a long time ago!

01:12:23.317 --> 01:12:24.719
It's okay. Hey.

01:12:25.886 --> 01:12:27.254
Calm down.

01:12:27.288 --> 01:12:28.289
Like I said...

01:12:29.690 --> 01:12:31.258
I want all of you to calm down.

01:12:32.393 --> 01:12:35.796
All right?
Promise to do that.

01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:37.531
And I'll let you go.

01:12:38.299 --> 01:12:39.634
Except Dani.

01:12:40.701 --> 01:12:42.837
Dani needs to be put down.

01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:45.439
- No!
- Let us out! Let us out!

01:12:45.473 --> 01:12:46.507
It's okay.

01:12:47.408 --> 01:12:48.542
It's for her own good.

01:12:50.478 --> 01:12:52.178
And yours.

01:12:53.848 --> 01:12:56.417
I'm sure you've figured out
her power by now.

01:12:56.817 --> 01:12:58.486
So special.

01:13:01.956 --> 01:13:04.425
She takes your greatest fear...

01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:06.494
your darkest secret...

01:13:07.561 --> 01:13:09.497
and makes you live through it.

01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:10.798
No!

01:13:10.831 --> 01:13:13.367
Over and over.

01:13:14.835 --> 01:13:17.972
Over and over.

01:13:18.005 --> 01:13:19.240
Until it kills you.

01:13:22.576 --> 01:13:24.245
That's it.

01:13:24.278 --> 01:13:25.846
That's it. Breathe.

01:13:31.686 --> 01:13:32.887
That's it.

01:13:38.392 --> 01:13:41.362
You're about to see
your father again.

01:13:41.395 --> 01:13:43.330
In the spirit world.

01:14:05.519 --> 01:14:06.787
What are you doing, Dani?

01:14:27.875 --> 01:14:28.943
Dani.

01:14:28.976 --> 01:14:30.745
Guys, she won't wake up.

01:14:30.778 --> 01:14:31.979
Help me.

01:14:32.012 --> 01:14:33.514
- Hey! Wake up!
- Dani!

01:14:34.849 --> 01:14:37.485
<i>Dani! Guys! Dani.</i>

01:14:40.554 --> 01:14:41.689
<i>It's coming back!</i>

01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:51.699
It's hunting us.

01:14:51.732 --> 01:14:53.834
No. It's hunting Dani.

01:14:54.435 --> 01:14:55.736
Why Dani?

01:14:56.737 --> 01:14:59.073
Because that's what she fears.

01:14:59.106 --> 01:15:01.509
Come on. Help me.

01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:04.078
All right.
One, two, three.

01:15:13.954 --> 01:15:16.090
Take Dani to a safe place...

01:15:16.123 --> 01:15:17.725
and I'll take care of this bear.

01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.701
What are you going to do?

01:15:27.735 --> 01:15:29.670
I'm going to play with it.

01:15:30.871 --> 01:15:32.573
Get her out of here.

01:15:42.516 --> 01:15:44.885
Are you crazy?
That thing'll kill you!

01:15:44.919 --> 01:15:46.654
He's right.
It's magic.

01:15:49.857 --> 01:15:51.625
So am I.

01:15:51.659 --> 01:15:52.660
No! Illy!

01:15:59.767 --> 01:16:01.569
Hey, Yogi!

01:16:03.904 --> 01:16:07.041
Lions and tigers
and bears. Oh, my.

01:16:08.175 --> 01:16:10.544
Right, Lockheed?

01:16:26.961 --> 01:16:27.995
Holy shit!

01:16:28.028 --> 01:16:29.563
I'm gonna marry that girl.

01:16:30.731 --> 01:16:32.132
You okay, Lockheed?

01:16:38.505 --> 01:16:40.708
Come on!
Let's go. Let's go.

01:16:40.741 --> 01:16:43.010
Berto, you have to run with her.

01:16:43.043 --> 01:16:44.411
I can't. I'm not ready.

01:16:44.445 --> 01:16:46.001
You won't hurt her.
You can do this.

01:16:48.682 --> 01:16:49.750
Come on! This way.

01:17:03.097 --> 01:17:05.799
You guys go.
I'm going back for Illy.

01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:06.967
Sam!

01:17:09.503 --> 01:17:11.138
Gotta get better someday.

01:17:12.139 --> 01:17:13.507
Give her to me.

01:17:14.074 --> 01:17:15.175
Hide.

01:17:17.144 --> 01:17:19.947
Demons can't come in churches.
Demons can't come in churches.

01:17:24.652 --> 01:17:28.455
Dani, I really need you
to wake up.

01:17:28.489 --> 01:17:30.225
Come back,
you coward!

01:17:30.258 --> 01:17:31.792
<i>Hail Mary,
full of grace...</i>

01:17:31.825 --> 01:17:33.661
<i>blessed art thou amongst women.</i>

01:17:33.694 --> 01:17:35.863
Pray for us sinners now
and in the hour of our death.

01:17:35.896 --> 01:17:37.831
Amen.

01:17:45.873 --> 01:17:47.608
Aah! No!

01:18:16.804 --> 01:18:17.905
Ahh!

01:18:32.619 --> 01:18:33.821
Demon Bear!

01:18:36.056 --> 01:18:38.226
Nowhere to run now.

01:18:40.995 --> 01:18:42.563
I know you're in there.

01:18:43.931 --> 01:18:46.967
Please. You're not alone.
I'm here.

01:18:47.001 --> 01:18:48.535
We're all here...

01:18:48.569 --> 01:18:50.571
<i>fighting for you.</i>

01:18:50.604 --> 01:18:52.072
Rahne, where are you?

01:18:54.641 --> 01:18:55.809
Rahne!

01:18:57.077 --> 01:19:00.014
Dani, I know
you can hear me in there.

01:19:02.049 --> 01:19:03.550
What are you doing?

01:19:03.584 --> 01:19:05.152
I'm hiding, the same thing
you're doing.

01:19:15.996 --> 01:19:17.031
Watch out!

01:19:26.207 --> 01:19:27.208
Lockheed!

01:19:33.814 --> 01:19:34.915
Berto!

01:19:34.948 --> 01:19:36.284
Nut up!

01:20:04.111 --> 01:20:05.112
Rahne!

01:20:11.919 --> 01:20:13.254
<i>You have to wake up...</i>

01:20:13.288 --> 01:20:15.856
or we're all going to die.

01:20:20.994 --> 01:20:22.029
Berto!

01:20:25.266 --> 01:20:27.134
No! Berto!

01:20:29.703 --> 01:20:31.638
Only you can stop this.

01:20:36.311 --> 01:20:37.811
I can't.

01:20:59.933 --> 01:21:00.934
Dani!

01:21:10.177 --> 01:21:11.279
Dad!

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.748
I'm so sorry.

01:21:17.485 --> 01:21:19.786
It wasn't your fault.

01:21:21.155 --> 01:21:23.458
But now you need to wake up.

01:21:23.491 --> 01:21:26.394
But the bear, it's too big.

01:21:28.028 --> 01:21:29.796
You're bigger.

01:21:40.908 --> 01:21:42.443
<i>Dani!</i>

01:21:44.778 --> 01:21:46.980
No! Dani! Help!

01:21:49.883 --> 01:21:51.051
<i>Dani!</i>

01:21:54.755 --> 01:21:55.756
No!

01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:58.326
Dani!

01:21:59.026 --> 01:22:00.727
Stop.

01:22:13.341 --> 01:22:15.042
No.

01:22:23.116 --> 01:22:24.151
No.

01:22:26.354 --> 01:22:28.289
I'm in charge now.

01:22:30.157 --> 01:22:31.526
Control.

01:22:41.336 --> 01:22:42.403
Good.

01:23:18.005 --> 01:23:20.241
Everything is gonna be okay.

01:23:24.379 --> 01:23:26.980
You don't have to worry
about anything anymore.

01:23:31.051 --> 01:23:33.820
But it's time
to go to sleep now.

01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:18.259
Thank you.

01:25:18.292 --> 01:25:19.627
Thanks, all of you.

01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:22.630
For saving me.

01:25:23.664 --> 01:25:24.665
Are you kidding?

01:25:27.502 --> 01:25:29.002
You saved us.

01:25:47.053 --> 01:25:50.991
Hey, guys. The dome's gone.

01:25:51.459 --> 01:25:53.494
So we're free?

01:25:53.528 --> 01:25:54.995
Reyes always said
the nearest town...

01:25:55.028 --> 01:25:56.464
is 20 miles away.

01:25:57.532 --> 01:25:59.200
She could be lying.

01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:04.672
Shall we find out?

01:26:16.217 --> 01:26:17.640
<i>My father
used to tell me that...</i>

01:26:17.652 --> 01:26:20.354
<i>inside every person,
there are two bears.</i>

01:26:22.423 --> 01:26:24.492
<i>One bear is all things good.</i>

01:26:24.525 --> 01:26:28.396
<i>Compassion, love, trust.</i>

01:26:28.429 --> 01:26:30.997
<i>The other is all things evil.</i>

01:26:31.031 --> 01:26:35.001
<i>Fear, shame,
and self-destruction.</i>

01:26:35.670 --> 01:26:38.439
<i>I asked him, "Which one wins?"</i>

01:26:39.774 --> 01:26:43.311
<i>He answered,
"The one you feed."</i>

01:26:54.181 --> 01:26:59.181
