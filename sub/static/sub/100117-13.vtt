00:01.523 --> 00:05.179
If the pizza man truly loves
this babysitter...

00:05.222 --> 00:08.138
why does he keep
slapping her rear?

00:16.103 --> 00:18.018
I learned that
from the pizza man.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.064
So, where is it?Where's what?

00:21.108 --> 00:22.326
The pizza.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.069
Alright.
I'm done.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.853
Hello.
Jack?

00:27.897 --> 00:30.160
Castiel: Billie kept him hidden
in the Empty

00:30.204 --> 00:32.032
until Chuck
went off world.

00:32.075 --> 00:34.860
It's time.Jack still doesn't
have a soul.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.079
If I do
exactly what she says,

00:36.123 --> 00:39.082
if I follow her plan,
I'll get stronger

00:39.126 --> 00:41.084
and I'll be able
to kill God.

00:41.128 --> 00:43.391
Billie: They're all dying.
Each and every world.

00:43.434 --> 00:44.740
Castiel:
It's Chuck.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.916
Mm-hmm.
He's been a busy boy.

00:46.959 --> 00:50.093
Wiping the slate clean --
for the end.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.877
This is your destiny.

00:51.921 --> 00:55.185
You are the messengers
of God's destruction.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.282
Any sign of him?

01:05.326 --> 01:06.892
No, nothing yet.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.285
Chuck's probably trashing
a few dozen universes

02:44.251 --> 02:47.297
Sam: So, this rift is open
in the middle of the armory,

02:47.341 --> 02:48.516
and the-- and these two guys
climb out of a car,

02:48.559 --> 02:50.300
and they look
just like us...

02:50.344 --> 02:51.997
Except not, and don't even
get me started about the car.

02:52.041 --> 02:54.478
Okay,
I am not understanding.

02:54.522 --> 02:56.306
Yeah, well,
welcome to the club.

02:56.350 --> 02:59.222
It's like they were us,
but I guess from another world?

02:59.266 --> 03:01.398
But how
did they get here?Billie:
They were running.

03:02.399 --> 03:05.489
Because God was destroying
their reality.

03:05.533 --> 03:10.190
He's almost done wrapping up
those other worlds.

03:10.233 --> 03:11.843
And when he is...It's our turn?

03:11.887 --> 03:13.062
Looks like.

03:13.105 --> 03:15.020
So we need
to be prepared.

03:15.064 --> 03:17.327
I have
the next step.

03:17.371 --> 03:19.373
For Jack.

03:25.596 --> 03:27.424
I'm ready.

03:27.468 --> 03:30.210
Feeling, um,
good about it.

03:30.253 --> 03:33.865
The first quest was meant
to strengthen Jack's body.

03:33.909 --> 03:37.608
Step two is more spiritual
in nature.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.393
Can you be
more specific?

03:39.436 --> 03:41.264
Jack needs to find
the Occultum.

03:41.308 --> 03:42.744
The Occultum?

03:42.787 --> 03:45.355
Occultum, that's, uh,
Latin for "hidden."

03:45.399 --> 03:46.400
Where do we find it?

03:46.443 --> 03:49.403
I don't know,
it's hidden.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.796
Missing for centuries.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.885
Sacred, potent.

03:53.929 --> 03:56.061
Is it a weapon?
Uh, how does it work?

03:56.105 --> 03:57.541
Not a weapon per se.

03:57.585 --> 04:00.152
But it's powerful.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.373
Okay. Thanks.
Big help.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.116
So, are you ready?

04:08.596 --> 04:11.381
Truly?

04:13.122 --> 04:15.385
I am.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.475
Good to hear.

04:18.519 --> 04:21.435
Because we need to be
ready and vigilant...

04:21.478 --> 04:24.089
and not stupid.

04:24.133 --> 04:28.268
God -- if he catches on
to what we're doing,

04:28.311 --> 04:31.401
everything comes
crashing down.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.451
The Occultum --

04:37.494 --> 04:40.758
there's barely even
a mention of this thing.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.413
And nothing
on where to find it.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.762
Mm-hmm.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.938
And what's this thing
supposed to even do?

04:46.982 --> 04:49.724
It's "spiritual"?
What does that even mean?

04:50.507 --> 04:52.770
Dean?

04:52.814 --> 04:55.425
Dean.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.471
Hmm?
What are you doing?

04:57.514 --> 04:58.950
I'm just thinking.

04:58.994 --> 05:01.692
I mean, this whole thing
is crazy, right?

05:01.736 --> 05:04.521
I mean, uh,
Death is our Obi-Wan,

05:04.565 --> 05:06.349
and you and me,
we're the --

05:06.393 --> 05:08.351
the "messengers of
God's destruction --"

05:08.395 --> 05:09.961
whatever the Hell
that means --

05:10.005 --> 05:12.007
and Jack is supposed to
kill God.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.792
But if he does...

05:14.836 --> 05:17.839
that still leaves
you know who.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.798
Amara.

05:20.842 --> 05:25.455
So I'm thinking
maybe he kills her, too.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.372
Seriously.

05:29.416 --> 05:32.636
'Cause listen, if we just
take Chuck off the board,

05:32.680 --> 05:34.377
that still leaves her,
okay?

05:34.421 --> 05:36.379
That throws things
out of balance,

05:36.423 --> 05:38.033
and if things
are out of balance,

05:38.076 --> 05:40.078
then the world pretty much --

05:40.122 --> 05:41.471
Yeah, ends.
Right.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.168
But if Jack
kills her...

05:43.212 --> 05:45.562
Kind of a family plan.

05:45.606 --> 05:48.652
Then there's no God,
there's no Darkness.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.350
Nothing out of balance.

05:50.393 --> 05:51.438
World saved.

05:51.481 --> 05:52.743
Okay, yeah,
but then who takes over?

05:52.787 --> 05:54.092
Uh, Jack?

05:59.054 --> 06:00.882
I just learned
how to do that.

06:02.405 --> 06:04.494
Probably not.

06:04.538 --> 06:07.584
Jack, listen, uh,
about Billie's plan, uh,

06:07.628 --> 06:10.935
she hasn't been real specific
on the details.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.589
Yeah, when you --
when you go up against Chuck,

06:12.633 --> 06:15.418
uh, you're gonna what,
bob and weave?

06:15.462 --> 06:18.029
Or do you go straight in
for the full smite?

06:18.073 --> 06:20.205
Yeah, you know, um,
something like that.

06:20.249 --> 06:23.034
Castiel:
Okay, yeah.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.514
Fine. I owe you.

06:25.733 --> 06:28.257
Well, I have information
on the Occultum

06:28.300 --> 06:30.259
from the shaman Sergei.

06:30.302 --> 06:32.609
Him?
Are we that desperate?

06:32.653 --> 06:34.089
I think so.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.438
So,
what did he say?

06:35.482 --> 06:37.266
The Occultum is divine
in its origin.

06:37.309 --> 06:39.050
It was housed
for hundreds of years

06:39.094 --> 06:40.878
in an ancient temple
before it was --

06:40.922 --> 06:42.445
Plundered by pirates.

06:42.489 --> 06:43.881
No.

06:43.925 --> 06:46.101
It was
dug up by tomb raiders.

06:46.144 --> 06:48.233
No.
It was seized

06:48.277 --> 06:50.061
by the King of the Dead
and his warlords. Am I close?

06:50.105 --> 06:52.542
Looted by invading Mongol hordes
for trade on the --

06:52.586 --> 06:54.065
Black market.
Yeah, that's what --

06:54.109 --> 06:55.415
I was gonna say that next.
That was the next one.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.982
Yeah.

06:58.026 --> 07:00.637
So, uh,
where is it now?

07:00.681 --> 07:02.552
Until a few years ago,

07:02.596 --> 07:04.424
it was owned
by the Jacobson family,

07:04.467 --> 07:07.296
until Hyram Jacobson's son
fell gravely ill.

07:07.339 --> 07:08.732
And he was told
nothing could be done.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.561
And in desperation,
he turned to a faith healer.

07:11.605 --> 07:12.910
She saved the child,

07:12.954 --> 07:16.087
but she would only accept
the Occultum in payment.

07:16.131 --> 07:17.437
Do we have a name?

07:17.480 --> 07:19.613
No,
just a description.

07:19.656 --> 07:20.918
She was attractive.

07:20.962 --> 07:24.356
And she healed the child
by laying on hands.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.575
Which glowed.

07:34.802 --> 07:37.282
Sam and Dean.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.589
You just
keep turning up.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.330
My two bad pennies.

07:41.373 --> 07:43.941
Looks like, uh,
business is still good.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.117
Well,
the healthcare system sucks,

07:46.161 --> 07:47.510
so I pick up
the slack.

07:47.554 --> 07:48.772
Making house calls?

07:48.816 --> 07:50.121
Sorry?

07:50.165 --> 07:51.601
Oh, maybe Hyram Jacobson
recommended you

07:51.645 --> 07:53.124
to a few
of his rich friends.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.604
I mean,
one gazillionaire

07:54.648 --> 07:58.216
trumps a hundred sad sacks
in a Kiwanis hall, am I right?

07:58.260 --> 08:00.654
Well, I really can't
talk about that.

08:00.697 --> 08:02.307
Patient confidentiality.

08:02.351 --> 08:04.614
Right. Of course.
Sure. In that case,

08:04.658 --> 08:07.487
uh, why don't you tell us
about the Occultum?

08:08.531 --> 08:10.490
What about it?

08:10.533 --> 08:11.795
We need it.

08:11.839 --> 08:14.798
Why?
To kill God.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.408
Hmm.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.715
Turns out that Hail Mary
that you and Cass tried,

08:18.759 --> 08:21.501
it worked.

08:21.544 --> 08:24.155
God's back,
he's pissed,

08:24.199 --> 08:26.636
and he's gonna
murder the world.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.551
Unless we stop him.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.553
So you want me
to be on your side...

08:30.597 --> 08:31.728
against God.

08:31.772 --> 08:34.557
I mean,
we are better-looking.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.906
No.

08:35.950 --> 08:39.693
I'm not going to make God
my enemy,

08:39.736 --> 08:41.869
because he's God.

08:44.132 --> 08:46.438
Well...

08:46.482 --> 08:48.353
you don't have
a choice.

08:48.397 --> 08:51.226
You wouldn't.
Try us.

08:51.269 --> 08:53.184
I don't have it.Then who does?

08:53.228 --> 08:55.578
An old friend of yours...
Ruby.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.580
Wait a second.
Why would you give it to her?

08:57.624 --> 08:59.408
It's a long story.

08:59.451 --> 09:01.279
I was on the road
near Topeka...

09:01.323 --> 09:03.194
Long days
of providing relief

09:03.238 --> 09:04.761
to the weak
and weary.

09:04.805 --> 09:08.765
Alone, yet warmed
by the comfort I provided.

09:08.809 --> 09:11.463
When she found me.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.685
Hey.

09:17.469 --> 09:20.429
Anything you want
to tell me, Jo?

09:20.472 --> 09:21.473
Nice vessel.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.693
Suits you better
than the blonde.

09:24.955 --> 09:27.436
Wait a minute.
You were friends?

09:27.479 --> 09:28.611
Oh, God, no.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.961
I mean, sometimes we'd pool
our talents,

09:31.005 --> 09:32.310
run a job together

09:32.354 --> 09:34.617
if the opportunity
presented itself.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.098
You've been holding out
on me.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.883
Ruby, I respect
our arrangement.

09:39.927 --> 09:42.799
Do I butt in when some sap
wants his soul back

09:42.843 --> 09:44.758
and you agree to return it
for a tidy fee?

09:44.801 --> 09:48.718
And I'm good with your little
bleeding-heart sideshow,

09:48.762 --> 09:52.287
but I'm talking way bigger
than you usual take.

09:53.157 --> 09:55.420
The Occultum.
You've got it.

09:55.464 --> 09:58.772
And I can get you
a buyer...

09:58.815 --> 09:59.947
for a taste.

09:59.990 --> 10:04.125
And why
would I agree to that?

10:04.168 --> 10:05.605
Money.

10:05.648 --> 10:08.782
Do you have any idea
how much that thing's worth?

10:09.696 --> 10:11.001
Millions.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.657
Now, tell me
that doesn't appeal

10:14.701 --> 10:16.441
to your
label-whore heart.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.269
Dean:
And then?

10:18.313 --> 10:19.923
I gave it to her.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.446
She said
she had hid it,

10:21.490 --> 10:23.100
until she contacted
the buyer.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.754
Which she never did because,
well, you...

10:26.190 --> 10:28.540
Aah!

10:28.584 --> 10:31.761
Okay,
so where is it now?Stashed.

10:31.805 --> 10:33.937
By her.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.548
In Hell.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.044
Hey, Jack.

10:54.088 --> 10:57.134
Cass, you know what's good
about being dead?

10:57.178 --> 10:59.702
Uh, as I recall,
very little.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.138
Well,
when you come back, you --

11:01.182 --> 11:03.880
you really get into
all that life is.

11:03.924 --> 11:08.755
Hot, cold, sweet,
spicy, funny, scary.

11:10.234 --> 11:13.150
And are you?

11:13.194 --> 11:14.891
"Into it"?

11:14.935 --> 11:17.024
I want to be.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.548
But I don't...

11:19.591 --> 11:22.812
feel things
the way I used to.

11:23.944 --> 11:26.555
Before I lost my...

11:27.774 --> 11:30.211
Your soul.

11:33.388 --> 11:36.739
I used to feel things.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.175
In my bones.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.177
It was glorious,
and sometimes unbearable.

11:40.221 --> 11:41.918
But I felt them.

11:41.962 --> 11:48.359
Now, I understand joy
or sadness, but...

11:48.403 --> 11:52.059
I know those things
aren't in me.

11:56.585 --> 11:59.109
I understand
why Sam and Dean were angered

11:59.153 --> 12:00.937
by what happened
to Mary...

12:00.981 --> 12:04.549
By what you did
to Mary.

12:04.593 --> 12:05.942
Yes.

12:05.986 --> 12:09.206
I see
that I've caused them pain.

12:09.250 --> 12:12.949
And it's clear
that things have changed.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.865
Especially with --
with Dean.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.783
Will he ever
forgive me?

12:20.827 --> 12:21.871
You know, Dean,

12:21.915 --> 12:27.224
he -- he feels things
more acutely

12:27.268 --> 12:29.618
than any human
I've ever known.

12:29.661 --> 12:32.795
So it's possible
he could work through this.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.972
One day, he may explode
and let it all out

12:36.016 --> 12:38.888
and breathe deeply
and move on.

12:38.932 --> 12:41.804
How long
will that take?

12:42.849 --> 12:44.894
I don't know.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.420
You sure
you can swing this again?

12:49.464 --> 12:52.815
Well, we have Rowena's notes
for the spell so...

12:52.859 --> 12:55.426
Okay, "Samwitch."

12:55.470 --> 12:57.951
Let's do this.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.256
Cass, hey, good news.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.781
We sorta know
where the Occultum is. Sorta.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.087
What?
What's wrong?

13:04.131 --> 13:06.916
Come with me.

13:09.701 --> 13:12.313
Cass,
what are we doing?

13:13.880 --> 13:17.492
Whoa.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.015
What the Hell?

13:20.234 --> 13:21.931
They can't see us
or hear us.

13:23.585 --> 13:27.284
What happened?
Where are they?

13:27.328 --> 13:29.634
I don't know.
I -- I think,

13:29.678 --> 13:31.201
if Chuck
tried to destroy them

13:31.245 --> 13:32.986
as their world's rift
was closing,

13:33.029 --> 13:35.510
it's
theoretically possible

13:35.553 --> 13:37.294
that the blast could've
trapped them between dimensions.

13:37.338 --> 13:38.687
I mean, they're...

13:38.730 --> 13:42.473
they're here
and yet not.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.301
Are they in pain?

13:45.607 --> 13:47.391
I don't think so.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.526
Good.

13:51.569 --> 13:53.658
Wait. Well, hold up, Dean.
You -- Will...

13:53.702 --> 13:55.312
We'll handle it,
okay?

13:55.356 --> 13:56.661
We'll deal with them,
but right now,

13:56.705 --> 13:57.880
you and me,
we got to go to Hell.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.708
Whoa.
You do?

13:59.751 --> 14:02.972
Jo said that's where
Ruby stashed the Occultum.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.191
Ruby?

14:04.234 --> 14:06.584
The demon you were
sexually intimate with?

14:07.542 --> 14:10.327
"Sexually intimate"?Yes.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.416
And you trust Jo now?

14:12.460 --> 14:13.853
Well,
Jo did help you out.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.072
Yes,
but Hell is a big place.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.682
You could be
searching forever.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.162
We need
more information, Dean.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.555
From who?

14:20.598 --> 14:23.993
What about Ruby?

14:24.037 --> 14:25.081
Ruby's dead,
Cass.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.343
We have to work
with what we have.

14:26.387 --> 14:27.997
So we'll go to Hell,
you stay topside

14:28.041 --> 14:31.174
and keep that spell alive
so we get back, alright?

14:44.971 --> 14:47.582
Alright, next time we fly
Air Abracadabra,

14:47.625 --> 14:48.931
we're upgrading
to first class.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.367
I can't take
the jet lag.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.021
Where do we start?

14:54.154 --> 14:55.546
Hey.

14:55.590 --> 14:58.941
Hi.You shouldn't be here.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.334
Yeah -- we know.

15:00.377 --> 15:02.423
We're, uh -- We're looking
for your boss, Rowena.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.948
She's hosting
a reception.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.168
For newly
condemned souls.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.911
Because that's a thing
we do now.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.042
Oh. Alright.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.565
But you could take us
to her, right?

15:14.609 --> 15:18.091
Yeah.
Good.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.623
So?
They made it?

15:28.666 --> 15:30.799
Sam and Dean
are in Hell?

15:30.842 --> 15:33.149
Yeah.

15:33.193 --> 15:34.455
But?

15:34.498 --> 15:36.979
But there are just so many holes
in Jo's story.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.329
Who was Ruby gonna sell
the Occultum to?

15:39.373 --> 15:41.070
Why didn't Jo try
to get it back?

15:41.114 --> 15:45.118
So you think
she's lying.
I think
we need to ask Ruby.

15:45.161 --> 15:46.771
Who's dead.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.426
Yeah.
In the Empty.

15:49.470 --> 15:51.994
I need
your assistance.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.604
Uh, sure.

15:53.648 --> 15:54.997
Anything.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.999
I need you
to kill me.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.261
Almost.

15:58.305 --> 16:01.177
Can someone be
almost dead?

16:01.221 --> 16:04.789
Well,
in theory...

16:04.833 --> 16:05.921
Aha.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.011
...if I'm brought
to death's brink,

16:09.055 --> 16:12.275
I should be able
to put one foot in the afterlife

16:12.319 --> 16:13.973
and contact Ruby.

16:14.016 --> 16:17.106
Cass, the Empty doesn't exactly
like you, remember?

16:17.150 --> 16:18.629
Yeah, I do.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.022
But our deal --

16:20.066 --> 16:23.460
I'm far from happy,
so I should be fine.

16:23.504 --> 16:26.463
I need you draw out
most of my life force,

16:26.507 --> 16:30.467
store it in here,
and then keep a close watch.

16:30.511 --> 16:34.167
If it seems like I'm --Really dying,
not almost dying?

16:34.210 --> 16:38.084
Then bring me back.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.652
Cass,
I-I may not have a soul,

16:41.696 --> 16:44.916
but, uh,
I know killing you is wrong.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.484
What if I screw up?

16:47.528 --> 16:49.878
Well, then I'll be
lost forever.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.576
But I think
you'll do fine.

16:54.535 --> 16:58.060
Oh, um, you need to feed
the spell bowl

16:58.104 --> 16:59.931
to keep the rift open
for Sam and Dean,

16:59.975 --> 17:03.544
or they'llbe
lost forever.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.242
Let's do it.

17:07.548 --> 17:09.506
Are you sure?

17:09.550 --> 17:11.421
Not at all.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.249
Give me one hour.

17:13.293 --> 17:15.208
Then bring me back.

17:48.328 --> 17:51.200
This way, guys.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.377
Sam:
Is it just me,

17:54.421 --> 17:56.249
or is this
feeling like...

18:02.690 --> 18:05.997
A trap.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.666
Hyah!

18:36.202 --> 18:38.160
Aah!

18:38.204 --> 18:41.163
Why you trying
to kill us?

18:41.207 --> 18:43.426
Because she told us to.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.254
Who? Rowena?
Jo.

18:45.298 --> 18:46.777
She said
if we helped her,

18:46.821 --> 18:48.866
she'd bust us
out of Hell.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.825
And why'd
she want us dead?

18:50.868 --> 18:53.480
Ask her yourself.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.614
Aah!

19:03.316 --> 19:06.057
That bitch set us up.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.814
Sister Jo.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.381
You're still here.

19:25.425 --> 19:26.904
Maybe you can help...

19:26.948 --> 19:28.297
No Sister Jo here.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.517
Heard she retired.
Florida.

19:33.868 --> 19:37.088
But here's some free advice --
don't make friends.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.352
They always ask
too much of you.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.488
Ruby?

19:45.532 --> 19:48.317
Ruby?

19:48.361 --> 19:51.668
Can you hear me?

19:53.279 --> 19:55.411
Ruby.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.674
Ruby!

19:59.110 --> 20:01.243
Ruby, can you hear me?

20:03.463 --> 20:06.509
Hello, Clarence.

20:08.555 --> 20:10.861
Meg.

20:10.905 --> 20:13.386
Oh, not so much.

20:16.432 --> 20:19.522
You're the Empty.You always were quick.

20:19.566 --> 20:21.263
Apparently,
you want to see Ruby,

20:21.307 --> 20:23.570
so I went with
a demon theme.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.267
Where can I find her?

20:25.311 --> 20:27.704
What does this look like,
a singles bar?

20:27.748 --> 20:29.619
This is not
a social call.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.273
I am here
fulfilling a request

20:31.317 --> 20:33.057
ordered by
Death herself.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.277
And I understand that you
and she are working together.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.236
Oh, yeah,
we're besties.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.281
But that doesn't mean
I'm gonna help little ol' you.

20:39.325 --> 20:40.935
Oh, yes, it does.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.458
Ugh.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.287
You're no fun.

20:45.331 --> 20:49.291
Go get her,
Pizza Man.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.873
Ruby.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.397
Where am I?

21:08.441 --> 21:11.400
You're dead.

21:11.444 --> 21:12.662
I remember.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.316
Are you dead?

21:14.360 --> 21:15.404
Almost.

21:15.448 --> 21:16.623
Oh. Lucky you.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.451
Ruby,
I woke you up

21:18.494 --> 21:20.322
because I'm looking for
an object known as the Occultum,

21:20.366 --> 21:23.325
and the angel Jo said
you hid it somewhere in Hell.

21:23.369 --> 21:26.285
Oh, did she?
Wow, that is so like her.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.938
Don't you think
it's a little obvious

21:27.982 --> 21:30.463
for a demon to be
hiding something in Hell?

21:30.506 --> 21:31.638
I don't know.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.509
Sam and Dean,
they're searching there now.

21:33.553 --> 21:34.771
Oh, Sam.

21:34.815 --> 21:37.339
How is the big lug?

21:37.383 --> 21:38.775
I liked him.

21:38.819 --> 21:41.517
We had a good thing
until he killed me.

21:41.561 --> 21:42.953
Listen,
I don't have a lot of time.

21:42.997 --> 21:44.346
Could we possibly just --

21:44.390 --> 21:47.349
W-When you went to Jo
about the Occultum --

21:47.393 --> 21:49.830
When I went
to see her?

21:51.875 --> 21:53.790
Shecalled me.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.837
Is this a trap?

21:58.882 --> 22:00.710
'Cause I will
mess you up.

22:00.754 --> 22:03.322
Wow.
That's how much you trust me.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.845
Girlfriend --

22:04.888 --> 22:07.064
I'm not your girlfriend.
What do you want?

22:07.108 --> 22:08.979
Here's the deal.

22:09.023 --> 22:11.199
Lucifer and Michael
are circling each other;

22:11.242 --> 22:12.505
there's gonna be
a showdown.

22:12.548 --> 22:15.203
And I know you think
you're in solid with Lucifer,

22:15.246 --> 22:17.466
but we both know
if those two go at it,

22:17.510 --> 22:18.815
it's Apocalypse time,

22:18.859 --> 22:20.730
and nothing
will be left standing.

22:20.774 --> 22:21.992
Maybe.

22:22.036 --> 22:25.692
And maybe
things go your way.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.171
But maybe
they go Heaven's,

22:27.215 --> 22:29.739
and if they do,
everyone will need a Plan B.

22:29.783 --> 22:33.830
Look, you and I work well
together when we have to.

22:33.874 --> 22:36.050
You are
a powerful demon,

22:36.093 --> 22:38.531
and I am
a good businesswoman.

22:38.574 --> 22:41.229
When the smoke clears,
there'll be a new world order.

22:41.272 --> 22:43.057
We can make that work
for us.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.711
You said
we'd all be dead.

22:44.754 --> 22:46.408
We don't have to be.

22:46.452 --> 22:49.585
Not if we ride it out
in the safest place that exists.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.413
I'm not following.

22:51.457 --> 22:52.588
The Occultum.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.416
Castiel:
The Occultum is a place?

22:54.460 --> 22:56.244
A place...
a thing...

22:56.287 --> 22:59.073
Whatever you want to call it,
it's powerful.

22:59.116 --> 23:02.076
Jo and I cut a deal,
and I stashed it.

23:02.119 --> 23:03.904
I can tell you
the location.

23:03.947 --> 23:06.210
And it's not in Hell.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.951
Does Jo know where it is?
Because she might try to --No.

23:07.995 --> 23:10.258
That girl
really can't be trusted,

23:10.301 --> 23:14.523
but you can trust me
if...

23:14.567 --> 23:16.046
If what?

23:16.090 --> 23:18.222
I'll help you
on one condition.

23:18.266 --> 23:20.703
That you get me
the Hell out of here.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.401
What?

23:26.317 --> 23:30.060
Guys.
You're back.
Jack?
What the Hell?

23:30.104 --> 23:32.062
Why do they call this place
the Empty?

23:32.106 --> 23:33.977
This place is full.

23:34.021 --> 23:36.066
It's full of sorrow
and despair

23:36.110 --> 23:38.155
playing
over and over again,

23:38.199 --> 23:41.550
of angels and demons
dreaming about their regrets.

23:41.594 --> 23:42.899
Forever.

23:42.943 --> 23:45.162
Yeah, I know.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.556
He's dead.
Kind of.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.559
For now.
What?

23:50.603 --> 23:52.953
Ruby: You're clearly connected,
Castiel.

23:52.996 --> 23:54.824
Just try.

23:54.868 --> 23:57.479
Okay, I'll try.

24:01.527 --> 24:04.007
The Occultum,
it's...

24:04.051 --> 24:05.487
Cass went to the Empty.
Hopefully.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.271
To find Ruby,
hopefully,

24:07.315 --> 24:09.752
to find out where this
Occultum thing is located.

24:09.796 --> 24:11.493
Hopefully.

24:15.976 --> 24:18.761
That's way too many
"hopefully's."Bring him back now!

24:20.633 --> 24:23.462
Meg:
Yo, Clarence.

24:25.202 --> 24:26.639
You got
what you wanted.

24:26.682 --> 24:29.119
Now what? You think you're gonna
just flit on home?

24:29.163 --> 24:31.644
Yes,
because we have a deal.

24:33.994 --> 24:35.952
I know we have a deal,
Feathers.

24:39.695 --> 24:40.957
You're not dead, yet.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.176
But for the time
you're here,

24:42.219 --> 24:43.699
I can make you wish
you were.

24:46.659 --> 24:48.356
You can't hurt me.

24:48.399 --> 24:50.793
Jack said we're on
the same side. Against Chuck.

24:50.837 --> 24:52.534
I'm on Death's side.

24:52.578 --> 24:55.145
Come on,
wake up, pal.

24:55.189 --> 24:56.495
When her plan works,

24:56.538 --> 24:58.714
I finally get
to go back to sleep.

24:58.758 --> 25:00.803
That's what she promised?

25:00.847 --> 25:02.501
She can do that?

25:03.589 --> 25:06.069
Come on, Cass.
Come on.

25:06.113 --> 25:07.723
Funny thing about her plan,
though...

25:07.767 --> 25:10.857
she didn't say anything
about needing you.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.516
Baby, you can't just traipse
in and out of here.

25:17.559 --> 25:18.865
It upsets
the order of things.

25:18.908 --> 25:20.693
Cass!

25:22.042 --> 25:24.000
Chardonnay, Clarence?

25:24.044 --> 25:25.654
Oh, you're probably
not in the mood.

25:25.698 --> 25:29.092
Aah!

25:30.703 --> 25:34.010
See you soon.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.887
Oh.

25:40.930 --> 25:42.410
You made it back.

25:42.453 --> 25:44.586
Yeah.
And so did you.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.283
You're an idiot,
by the way.

25:46.327 --> 25:47.720
What if
this hadn't worked?

25:47.763 --> 25:49.069
But it did.

25:49.112 --> 25:52.463
The Occultum was never
in Hell.

25:52.507 --> 25:53.682
Yeah,
we get that.

25:53.726 --> 25:56.206
The Occultum
is apparently

25:56.250 --> 25:59.688
the safest place
in the world.

25:59.732 --> 26:01.081
Jo was never
gonna give that up.

26:01.124 --> 26:02.604
It's a "place"?

26:02.648 --> 26:04.040
So you saw Ruby.

26:04.084 --> 26:07.043
And I got
the location.

26:09.263 --> 26:11.744
Am I still an idiot?

26:13.746 --> 26:16.705
Well, yeah.Let's go, then.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.272
Jack: Wait.

26:18.315 --> 26:21.144
What if Chuck checks in on us
and sees what we're doing.

26:21.188 --> 26:23.146
Isn't it
pretty much over?

26:23.190 --> 26:25.105
Yeah,
it would be.

26:25.845 --> 26:27.716
Uh...

26:27.760 --> 26:30.458
I have a dumb idea.

26:30.501 --> 26:32.634
If Chuck comes back
and checks in on us,

26:32.678 --> 26:34.897
he's gonna look for us here
in the bunker.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.246
We don't know that.

26:36.290 --> 26:37.639
Well, we don't
notknow that.

26:37.683 --> 26:41.730
So Chuck would need
to see us

26:41.774 --> 26:45.473
here in the bunker.

26:45.516 --> 26:48.432
Wait.
So you want them to be you?

26:48.476 --> 26:50.783
Well, it's not that hard.
Me and Sam do it every day.

26:50.826 --> 26:53.263
So I'm thinking we open up
a rift with a spell,

26:53.307 --> 26:54.743
kind of like we did
with Apocalypse World.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.092
But we don't need
archangel juice

26:56.136 --> 26:57.441
'cause we're just trying
to get them out

26:57.485 --> 26:58.660
of this in-between.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.749
I'm thinking Cass' grace
would be enough.

27:00.793 --> 27:04.666
Or it'll blast them away
to another world.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.799
Maybe.

27:06.842 --> 27:10.019
But it's better
than leaving them here.

27:16.156 --> 27:17.766
Koth.

27:17.810 --> 27:19.768
Munto.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.770
Nuntox.

27:42.269 --> 27:46.186
So, uh, back home,
you're -- you're Hunters?

27:46.229 --> 27:48.797
We wereHunters.

27:48.841 --> 27:51.017
The family business.

27:51.060 --> 27:52.801
But our world's
probably gone.

27:52.845 --> 27:55.804
We made it out
just before the explosion.

27:55.848 --> 27:56.892
That's God.

27:56.936 --> 27:58.241
God?
Sam: Yeah.

27:58.285 --> 27:59.808
You're gonna need
another beer.

27:59.852 --> 28:01.723
We actually don't drink
much of this stuff.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.899
Dad won't keep it
in the house.

28:03.943 --> 28:06.902
He only likes
his "private-label Scotch."

28:06.946 --> 28:07.903
He spoils us.

28:07.947 --> 28:10.863
Wait, your dad is...
still around?

28:10.906 --> 28:12.821
And he "spoils" you?

28:12.865 --> 28:14.518
Well, he did.

28:14.562 --> 28:15.781
We don't know
where he is now.

28:15.824 --> 28:17.347
Uh, we all went through
the rift together,

28:17.391 --> 28:19.349
but, uh,
guess we got separated.

28:19.393 --> 28:21.917
Mm.
To Dad.

28:21.961 --> 28:24.267
Best guy ever.

28:34.234 --> 28:36.845
So,
this is where you live.

28:36.889 --> 28:38.542
Yeah, yeah.

28:38.586 --> 28:41.763
And this is where your
Hunting operation is based?

28:41.807 --> 28:43.199
Uh, I mean,

28:43.243 --> 28:45.027
it's not really
much of an operation.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.769
No, no, no. No, no, we --
we -- we do just fine. We, uh --

28:48.944 --> 28:51.904
We hunt monsters
all over the country.

28:51.947 --> 28:54.558
It's exhausting,
isn't it?

28:54.602 --> 28:55.777
Mm.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.387
But we --
we do it worldwide.

28:57.431 --> 29:00.869
We have to keep
two sets of pilots on standby.

29:00.913 --> 29:03.045
You guys
have your own plane?

29:03.089 --> 29:04.917
You don't?

29:05.831 --> 29:08.485
Oh, dear.
How do you manage?

29:08.529 --> 29:10.052
How do you afford it?

29:10.096 --> 29:12.446
We get paid.

29:13.490 --> 29:14.883
For Hunting monsters.

29:14.927 --> 29:16.232
You what?

29:16.276 --> 29:19.801
Yes.
HunterCorp does very well.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.063
HunterCorp?

29:21.107 --> 29:22.804
Yeah. Well, got to hand it
to the old man, huh?

29:22.848 --> 29:25.764
Pretty much built up
an entire empire from scratch.

29:25.807 --> 29:26.808
To Dad.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.332
Smartest guy ever.

29:30.290 --> 29:31.813
Hmm. Alright.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.815
Uh, well,
look, fellas,

29:33.859 --> 29:36.644
thanks again for the, uh --
for the rescue.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.820
Oh, uh,
glad you brought that up.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.909
See, we got ourselves
a bit of a situation here.

29:40.953 --> 29:44.695
Oh.
God smashed your world
like we said and...

29:44.739 --> 29:47.437
And now he's gonna
take out this one.

29:47.481 --> 29:48.830
And we're gonna stop him.

29:48.874 --> 29:51.006
But he may be
checking in on us here.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.703
Wait.

29:53.574 --> 29:56.795
God "checks in" on you?

29:56.838 --> 29:57.883
Yeah.

29:57.926 --> 30:00.929
Uh, we kind of have a...
relationship.

30:00.973 --> 30:02.452
So if he decides
to look in on us,

30:02.496 --> 30:04.019
we don't want him to know
what we're doing.

30:04.063 --> 30:06.282
So you two
are gonna be here,

30:06.326 --> 30:08.284
pretending to be us.

30:08.328 --> 30:09.677
And how
do we do that?

30:09.720 --> 30:12.680
Well, first off,
I'm sorry,

30:12.723 --> 30:14.116
you're gonna have to lose
the man bun.

30:15.988 --> 30:17.990
Mm.

30:18.033 --> 30:19.861
I will not.

30:21.689 --> 30:23.865
Right.
Uh, and then, uh...

30:49.195 --> 30:51.893
Dean:
This the place?

30:51.937 --> 30:53.503
You sure?

30:53.547 --> 30:55.505
Ruby was very specific.

30:55.549 --> 30:57.725
Yeah, well,
so was Jo.

30:57.768 --> 31:00.902
Guys, I-I know I haven't been
doing this as long as you,

31:00.946 --> 31:02.904
but doesn't this seem
a little easy?

31:02.948 --> 31:05.037
Yeah.

31:09.215 --> 31:11.086
You hear something?

31:19.225 --> 31:20.922
Is that a...bear?

31:23.446 --> 31:26.536
No.
It's more like a...Hellhounds.

31:26.580 --> 31:29.409
Dean.

31:29.975 --> 31:32.194
Dean, you want to hurry
a little bit?

31:36.938 --> 31:39.810
Go, go, go!

31:46.295 --> 31:48.776
You got it?Yeah.

31:48.819 --> 31:52.084
Guess Ruby forgot to mention
the freakin' Hellhounds.

31:52.127 --> 31:53.433
Yeah,
it would seem.

31:55.174 --> 31:56.915
Where are we
supposed to look?

31:59.265 --> 32:03.138
She said the "top of the cross"
would point the way.

32:05.706 --> 32:07.403
What's it supposed to
be pointing to?

32:07.447 --> 32:10.232
Guys! Could you maybe
move it along?!

32:21.287 --> 32:23.071
Dean, Cass.

32:25.987 --> 32:27.510
The top
of the cross...

32:27.554 --> 32:29.425
it's right there.

32:31.688 --> 32:34.430
Guys!
I can't hold 'em forever!

32:45.659 --> 32:48.009
The Hell is that?
Is that a map?

32:48.053 --> 32:50.098
Maybe it's a key.

32:50.142 --> 32:51.360
It's a passage
in Enochian.

32:51.404 --> 32:54.537
It says, um,
loosely translated,

32:54.581 --> 32:56.887
"In order to be
in the Occultum,

32:56.931 --> 32:59.368
the Occultum must be
in you."

33:11.902 --> 33:14.122
They said
lose the man bun, Samuel.

33:15.515 --> 33:17.996
Look, hillbilly clothes
are bad enough.

33:18.039 --> 33:20.215
I have to
draw the line somewhere,

33:20.259 --> 33:22.217
and my hair...

33:22.261 --> 33:23.697
is sacred.

33:24.524 --> 33:26.482
So,
what do we do now?

33:26.526 --> 33:27.831
This is it.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.050
They said
be authentic,

33:29.094 --> 33:31.661
drink beer in front of
a computer screen.

33:31.705 --> 33:34.055
That's their lives?
Mm-hmm.

33:35.274 --> 33:37.754
Oh, my God.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.669
You get used to it.

33:39.713 --> 33:41.584
Whoa!

33:41.628 --> 33:43.891
Woman: Hey, there, big boy.
Check this out.

33:43.934 --> 33:46.502
And there's like a ton
of these files in here.

33:47.764 --> 33:49.897
Press my button
to enter me.

33:49.940 --> 33:53.509
Can you imagine if Dad caught us
with that kind of stuff?

33:53.553 --> 33:55.337
Goodbye,
trust funds.

33:55.381 --> 33:57.165
Wow.

33:58.471 --> 33:59.950
Wanna chat?

33:59.994 --> 34:02.518
I got to tell you, Sammy,
this Sam and Dean,

34:02.562 --> 34:05.217
you know,
sure they're simple,

34:05.260 --> 34:07.088
but they've got
this place of their own.

34:07.132 --> 34:10.918
There's no quarterly reports,
there's no investor calls,

34:10.961 --> 34:14.269
there's just --
there's nothing to do

34:14.313 --> 34:17.098
but hunt monsters,
drink beer,

34:17.142 --> 34:18.534
and watch porn.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.362
Hey, there, big boy.

34:22.234 --> 34:23.278
Yeah.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.454
They've got it made.

34:28.501 --> 34:30.938
Guys,
I don't like it, alright?

34:30.981 --> 34:34.115
I mean, first Jo sets us up
with the -- with killer demons,

34:34.159 --> 34:36.248
and now Ruby sends us to a place
with Hellhounds?

34:36.291 --> 34:38.076
These chicks
want us dead.

34:38.119 --> 34:40.600
I don't trust
any part of this.Ahh!

34:40.643 --> 34:41.992
Where's the thing?

34:42.036 --> 34:44.560
Um, I ate it.You what?

34:44.604 --> 34:47.085
Well, it said
it had to be in me, so --

34:47.128 --> 34:48.912
No!
Spit it out.It's fine.

34:48.956 --> 34:50.784
Okay?
Nothing's happening.

34:53.003 --> 34:54.135
Aah!

34:54.179 --> 34:55.571
Jack? Jack?

34:57.791 --> 35:00.272
Jack?

35:02.622 --> 35:05.494
Jack.

35:29.649 --> 35:32.130
You must not be human.

35:32.173 --> 35:35.263
Humans may not
enter here.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.483
Are you an angel?

35:37.526 --> 35:41.617
Um,
it's a long story.

35:46.405 --> 35:48.885
Why do humans
have to stay out?

35:48.929 --> 35:50.713
This is the Garden.

35:50.757 --> 35:52.280
Man's beginning.

35:52.324 --> 35:54.891
You mean...Eden.

35:54.935 --> 35:57.677
Like Adam and Eve?

35:57.720 --> 36:00.027
God loved them so.

36:00.070 --> 36:03.204
His prize creations,
until he banished them

36:03.248 --> 36:06.468
and all of mankind from
the perfection of the Garden.

36:06.512 --> 36:08.166
And he hid it away.

36:10.429 --> 36:13.562
I was told this place
might change me somehow.

36:13.606 --> 36:15.216
Perhaps.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.697
If you were the one
meant to find it.

36:19.742 --> 36:22.658
You'll know soon enough.

36:33.800 --> 36:36.194
What do you mean
if Jack comes back?

36:36.237 --> 36:37.499
I don't know
what's happening here.

36:37.543 --> 36:39.414
I-I had no idea
this was gonna involve

36:39.458 --> 36:42.417
ingesting some magic sphere
and then disappearing, Dean.

36:52.906 --> 36:57.084
Who are you, really?

36:57.127 --> 37:01.567
Who are you
meant to be?

37:04.004 --> 37:06.528
Alright.
So, what do you want to do next?

37:06.572 --> 37:08.269
Alright.

37:09.749 --> 37:12.142
Jack,
what's wrong?

37:12.186 --> 37:15.102
Suzie!

37:15.145 --> 37:18.236
There's no going back.
You realize that now.

37:19.802 --> 37:21.239
Aah!

37:21.282 --> 37:23.284
Listen to me!Leave me alone!

37:24.416 --> 37:27.462
They're never gonna
trust you again.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.662
The Hell?

38:05.370 --> 38:06.588
Aah!

38:22.561 --> 38:24.214
Jack.

38:24.258 --> 38:25.955
Jack?

38:28.480 --> 38:30.960
Hey.

38:31.004 --> 38:32.614
You okay?

38:44.060 --> 38:46.193
Alright, fellas.
Well, thanks for your help.

38:46.236 --> 38:48.543
Now it's, uh,
time to go.

38:48.587 --> 38:50.502
You know, we, uh --

38:50.545 --> 38:53.374
we could just
all live here together.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.507
Like a club.

38:56.290 --> 38:57.465
That would
just be weird.

38:57.509 --> 38:59.380
It wouldn't be
so weird.

38:59.424 --> 39:02.557
Trust me, where you want to be
is Brazil, okay?

39:02.601 --> 39:04.211
It's far away,

39:04.254 --> 39:08.041
and there's nothing
but beaches, babes, carnival.

39:08.084 --> 39:12.524
Oh, uh, you think we could keep
the flannel shirts?

39:12.567 --> 39:14.874
No.

39:16.266 --> 39:17.485
Okay.

39:19.095 --> 39:22.838
Oh, uh,
when we were looking around,

39:22.882 --> 39:26.015
we, uh -- we saw it.

39:26.059 --> 39:28.888
"It"?
The car.

39:32.892 --> 39:34.850
You didn't touch it.

39:34.894 --> 39:36.417
Oh.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.027
We drove in it.

39:38.071 --> 39:39.551
I'm sorry, you what?

39:42.641 --> 39:44.382
And we're leaving.

39:44.425 --> 39:46.122
Ow!
My arm -- you're hurting it.

39:46.166 --> 39:47.602
Sam.
Dean.

39:47.646 --> 39:49.735
Have fun in Rio!

39:53.478 --> 39:55.915
Is the kid okay?

39:55.958 --> 39:57.569
I don't know.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.924
He seems
to have recovered.

40:04.967 --> 40:07.056
So, Jack's back?

40:07.100 --> 40:08.623
Yeah, he is.

40:08.667 --> 40:11.757
But, um,
something's different.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.150
Jack is, uh --

40:14.194 --> 40:15.630
well,
he's been to the Garden.

40:15.674 --> 40:18.416
That's the crossroads
of divinity and humanity.

40:18.459 --> 40:21.331
No one's been there
since the exile till now.

40:22.942 --> 40:25.205
Till Jack.

40:34.519 --> 40:36.825
Sam:
Hey, Jack.

40:36.869 --> 40:39.480
How you doing?

40:39.524 --> 40:41.090
I...

40:41.134 --> 40:43.615
I'm so sorry.

40:43.658 --> 40:45.355
You what?

40:47.619 --> 40:49.925
Why didn't I get it?

40:49.969 --> 40:53.102
I mean,
my mother died, too.

40:53.146 --> 40:55.931
Why didn't I understand?

40:58.978 --> 41:01.589
It was my fault.

41:08.553 --> 41:11.381
Jack...

41:15.560 --> 41:17.823
His soul is back.

41:23.872 --> 41:25.700
Please.

41:25.744 --> 41:29.530
Just please forgive me.
