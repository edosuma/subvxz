WEBVTT

00:02.506 --> 00:04.303
Here's what happened last week.

00:04.474 --> 00:07.671
George and I went up to NBC, and
we told them the idea for the series.

00:07.844 --> 00:09.072
We're waiting to sign the contract.

00:09.246 --> 00:12.181
- Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
- We're gonna sign it.

00:12.349 --> 00:14.442
In fact, George is out with
the woman from NBC right now.

00:14.618 --> 00:16.449
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to pass.

00:16.620 --> 00:19.680
- You're passing?
- Well, it's much too low.

00:19.856 --> 00:21.721
That's it for this piece of junk.
I've had it.

00:21.892 --> 00:24.190
- Is it the one your parents gave you?
- It never works.

00:24.361 --> 00:26.386
- Where's that watch we bought you?
- It's at the jeweler.

00:26.563 --> 00:28.030
I would like somebody to hit me.

00:28.198 --> 00:29.893
What's the matter
with this Davola guy?

00:30.066 --> 00:31.363
He's after Jerry now.

00:31.535 --> 00:35.062
I never had a back problem until that
night I slept on the convertible sofa.

00:36.806 --> 00:39.570
Cuban cigars.
It's a present from my father.

00:39.743 --> 00:40.937
- Here you go.
- What, cigars?

00:41.111 --> 00:42.100
Yeah, Cubans.

00:45.549 --> 00:46.777
- What's wrong?
- The Velcro.

00:46.950 --> 00:49.714
I can't stand Velcro.
That tearing sound.

00:49.886 --> 00:52.252
Now, listen to me. I'm negotiating.

00:52.422 --> 00:55.721
Negotiation.
This is what you do in business.

00:55.892 --> 00:57.723
- Leave all my stuff here?
- Leave it.

00:57.894 --> 00:59.725
Tell us about the trip.
How's Dr. Reston?

00:59.896 --> 01:01.488
He has this power over me, okay?

01:01.665 --> 01:05.123
He has this way of manipulating
every little word that I say.

01:05.302 --> 01:07.133
He's like a Svenjolly.

01:07.304 --> 01:09.966
Tell this guy you're seeing somebody
else. That's the easiest way.

01:10.140 --> 01:12.267
His name is Kramer.

01:12.442 --> 01:14.342
I want you to tell this young man
to give me a call.

01:14.511 --> 01:17.002
My wallet's gone! My wallet's gone!

01:17.180 --> 01:18.169
Where did you get that watch?

01:18.481 --> 01:20.642
I found it in the garbage can.

01:20.817 --> 01:24.446
What kind of an idiot throws away
a perfectly good watch?

01:25.455 --> 01:29.016
It's an entire industry of bad gifts,
all those executive gifts.

01:30.594 --> 01:33.427
Any stupid, goofy, brass,
wood thing.

01:33.597 --> 01:35.758
They put a piece of green felt
on the bottom.

01:36.166 --> 01:40.102
"It's a golf, desk, tie
and stress organizer, Dad."

01:40.270 --> 01:43.467
Well, to me, nothing compares
with the paperweight as a bad gift.

01:43.640 --> 01:46.803
There's no better way than a
paperweight to express to someone...

01:46.977 --> 01:50.276
...that, "I refuse to put any thought
into this at all."

01:51.381 --> 01:55.750
Where are these people working that
papers are blowing right off of desks?

01:55.919 --> 02:00.117
Are the desks screwed to the back of a
flatbed truck going down the highway?

02:00.290 --> 02:02.622
Are they typing in the crow's-nest
of a clipper ship?

02:02.792 --> 02:04.316
What do you need
a paperweight for?

02:10.199 --> 02:12.395
I don't understand this jeweler,
Jimmy Sherman.

02:12.569 --> 02:16.903
He brings a watch, takes over a week
to fix it. He fixed yours in one day.

02:17.073 --> 02:19.541
Oh, you know these jewelers.
They're enigmas.

02:19.709 --> 02:22.337
They're mysteries wrapped
in a riddle.

02:24.014 --> 02:26.175
- She's very attractive.
- She's okay.

02:26.349 --> 02:27.976
- Just okay?
- She's nice.

02:28.151 --> 02:30.210
- She's better than nice.
- She's all right.

02:30.387 --> 02:32.480
- She's beautiful.
- She's not beautiful.

02:32.656 --> 02:35.284
- I think she's beautiful.
- So you ask her out.

02:35.458 --> 02:37.085
- I'm not gonna ask her out.
- Why not?

02:37.260 --> 02:39.660
If you don't think she's beautiful,
something's wrong.

02:39.829 --> 02:41.820
She's pretty. She's not beautiful.

02:41.998 --> 02:44.728
I should drop dead
if she's not beautiful.

02:44.901 --> 02:48.667
- I think that's a little extreme.
- She's all right.

02:48.838 --> 02:52.604
Two exact same watches.
He tells you a week and him a day.

02:52.776 --> 02:54.641
How could that be?

02:54.811 --> 02:56.540
Something's fishy about this.

02:58.114 --> 02:59.513
He said what?

02:59.683 --> 03:02.516
- "The hell with them."
- "The hell with them"?

03:03.119 --> 03:06.555
- Those were his exact words.
- Oh, boy.

03:06.723 --> 03:10.215
He said, "We've got 500 shows
to choose from.

03:10.393 --> 03:15.353
Why should we give two guys with
no idea or experience more money?"

03:15.532 --> 03:17.523
He was pretty emphatic?

03:17.701 --> 03:20.226
- He pounded on his desk.
- He pounded?

03:20.403 --> 03:22.769
I told you to take the offer.

03:22.939 --> 03:27.000
Look, I had nothing to do with this.
It wasn't my decision.

03:27.444 --> 03:30.641
It was Jerry. Jerry told me.
I'm the creative guy.

03:30.814 --> 03:33.715
- He handles the business end.
- You said it was insulting.

03:33.883 --> 03:38.286
I was quoting him. Why would I be
insulted? I'm never insulted.

03:38.455 --> 03:41.947
You could call me "baldy," dump soup
on my head. Nothing insults me.

03:42.125 --> 03:45.356
- Well, there's nothing I can do.
- Don't they make a counteroffer?

03:45.528 --> 03:49.055
How can he just cancel the deal?
What kind of a maniac is this guy?

03:49.232 --> 03:52.565
- He just says no, and that's it?
- Yeah, that's the way Russell is.

03:52.736 --> 03:55.705
- He doesn't like to play games.
- He has to play. He can't not play.

03:55.872 --> 03:57.430
We're playing.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.767
I gotta see him.
How do I get in touch with him?

03:59.976 --> 04:02.809
- You'll have to wait till Monday.
- No. I can't wait till Monday.

04:02.979 --> 04:06.005
That's impossible. I gotta talk
to him now. Where does he live?

04:06.182 --> 04:08.412
I can't give you his address.

04:09.018 --> 04:12.215
- Give me that address.
- Hey, give me that!

04:14.791 --> 04:17.555
He just wants to talk to you.
I couldn't talk him out of it.

04:17.726 --> 04:22.289
So you just tell him that you're my
boyfriend and that we're in love, okay?

04:22.465 --> 04:24.660
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, I'm your boyfriend. Yeah.

04:24.834 --> 04:28.167
- Okay.
- Have we been intimate?

04:29.939 --> 04:32.100
Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.

04:32.275 --> 04:34.709
All right, how often do we do it?

04:35.845 --> 04:38.712
Kramer, how is that important?
Honestly, do you really think...

04:38.882 --> 04:40.873
...he's going to ask...?
- He's a psychiatrist.

04:41.050 --> 04:43.143
They're interested in stuff like that.

04:43.820 --> 04:46.254
All right. All right. We do it...

04:46.956 --> 04:49.117
...five times a week, okay?

04:49.392 --> 04:52.225
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, my...

04:53.129 --> 04:55.154
All right, listen.

04:55.331 --> 04:57.731
- Just tell me what you'll say.
- I know what to say.

04:57.901 --> 05:01.029
- No, but I would like to hear it.
- I don't wanna say it out loud.

05:01.204 --> 05:04.833
It kills the spontaneity. You know,
Gleason, he never rehearsed.

05:05.308 --> 05:07.469
- Go ahead. Do it.
- Okay. You talk to him.

05:07.644 --> 05:09.805
- I'll talk to him.
- Hey, how's your hair?

05:09.979 --> 05:11.844
Well, yeah, it's good.

05:12.015 --> 05:15.974
You're not the type who should be
playing with matches, seriously.

05:17.654 --> 05:20.748
Yes. Dr. Reston.

05:21.291 --> 05:22.690
Is he in?

05:22.859 --> 05:26.226
Well, this is Kramer,
and he's expecting my call.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:37.140 --> 05:40.735
- Is he?
- Yes, yes, Dr. Reston.

05:41.477 --> 05:43.035
Well, hello there.

05:43.213 --> 05:46.614
- Well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's.
- No, no, not friends.

05:46.783 --> 05:51.447
We're actually... We're not friends.
We're much more than friends.

05:51.754 --> 05:56.316
And... I'm afraid
we have a bit of a problem.

05:56.492 --> 05:59.689
Well, the point is doctor,
I'm very much in love with Elaine...

05:59.863 --> 06:04.095
...and she's very much in love
with me, and, well...

06:04.267 --> 06:08.067
...we would appreciate it if
you would cease and desist...

06:08.238 --> 06:11.105
...and allow us to pursue
our courtship unfettered.

06:11.808 --> 06:16.472
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I
can make things unpleasant for you...

06:16.646 --> 06:20.309
...and your staff, if you have one.

06:21.751 --> 06:25.118
Yes. Yeah, but the point that l...

06:27.557 --> 06:31.391
Well, no. Well, yeah, that's...
It's possible.

06:33.263 --> 06:36.755
Well, I suppose I could, but I'd
have to shift a few things around.

06:37.367 --> 06:41.827
Wait. Hold on for a second, will you?
Go ahead. Yeah.

06:42.472 --> 06:43.905
All right.

06:44.374 --> 06:48.276
Yeah. Yeah. Well, okay.
I look forward to it too.

06:49.078 --> 06:50.841
Okay, so long.

06:51.014 --> 06:53.141
What happened? What did he say?
What's going on?

06:53.316 --> 06:57.116
- Okay, he wants to get together.
- Get together?

06:57.287 --> 06:59.278
- Why?
- You know, he wants to talk.

06:59.455 --> 07:02.652
Why didn't you just say no?

07:04.727 --> 07:06.888
That's interesting.

07:07.964 --> 07:11.422
- Did you enjoy your croissant?
- It was different.

07:12.168 --> 07:14.534
- And how was yours?
- Oh, very good.

07:14.704 --> 07:17.138
Try our mousse.
It'll change your life expectancy.

07:17.941 --> 07:20.341
No, thanks. Just the check.

07:23.713 --> 07:25.442
What's the matter with you?

07:25.815 --> 07:27.715
- What?
- Why didn't you didn't flirt?

07:27.884 --> 07:29.476
- Come on.
- She was flirting with you.

07:29.686 --> 07:31.813
- Why didn't you say something?
- What would I say?

07:31.988 --> 07:34.957
- You just sat there.
- Well, you made me uncomfortable.

07:35.124 --> 07:38.321
You're a comedian. Couldn't you
come up with something?

07:38.895 --> 07:41.864
- Where's the bathroom?
- In the back, on your right.

07:46.469 --> 07:48.562
- Dad.
- Will you stop it. Jerry, let go.

07:48.738 --> 07:50.933
- Jerry.
- Would you let me pay just once?

07:51.107 --> 07:53.974
- You're out of your mind.
- You don't even have a wallet.

07:54.143 --> 07:55.872
- Don't worry about it.
- What'll you do?

07:56.045 --> 07:58.036
What's the difference?
We'll figure it out.

07:58.214 --> 08:01.308
- You're not paying.
- All right, fine. You figure it out.

08:01.484 --> 08:04.248
I'd be curious to know how you
pick up a check with no money.

08:04.420 --> 08:07.287
Because if this works, the whole
monetary system's obsolete.

08:07.457 --> 08:09.652
We're back to wampum.

08:10.026 --> 08:12.051
I'm going to the bathroom.

08:13.096 --> 08:15.929
How the hell am I gonna pay
for this?

08:20.903 --> 08:24.031
They give you some portion here,
huh?

08:25.508 --> 08:28.807
Uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't rude that
day I bumped into you on the street.

08:28.978 --> 08:32.379
- I really did have to get to a meeting.
- Oh, no, no, I understand.

08:32.548 --> 08:34.345
I got plenty of friends
in show business.

08:34.517 --> 08:36.508
I know you're all very busy.

08:36.686 --> 08:39.313
So you found that watch
in a garbage can, huh?

08:39.489 --> 08:43.619
Yeah. In fact, it was right after
I ran into you.

08:44.327 --> 08:46.727
You know, a friend of mine
has a watch just like that.

08:46.896 --> 08:49.364
I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.

08:49.532 --> 08:52.501
Well, I haven't seen
too many like these.

08:52.668 --> 08:54.829
Yeah, I know.

08:55.338 --> 08:57.932
Maybe you wanna sell me that one?

08:58.107 --> 09:00.632
Oh, sure.

09:02.378 --> 09:07.247
Hang on a second.
I got a little proposition for you.

09:09.952 --> 09:12.477
There is a George Bonanza
to see you.

09:12.655 --> 09:16.147
- Costanza. Costanza.
- George Costanza.

09:16.325 --> 09:18.793
The guy who pitched the show
with stories about nothing.

09:18.961 --> 09:22.624
- Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
- Seinfeld friend.

09:22.799 --> 09:25.029
He says call him Monday.

09:26.502 --> 09:29.938
Mr. Dalrymple, I have to talk to you.
It's about the show.

09:30.173 --> 09:35.042
It was all a terrible misunderstanding.
Just five minutes of your time.

09:35.645 --> 09:38.045
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Dalrymple.

09:39.082 --> 09:41.277
Very good, sir.

09:42.518 --> 09:45.248
You don't understand.
I can't allow my son to pay for me.

09:45.421 --> 09:49.152
Look, as soon as I get back to Florida,
I promise you, I'll mail you a check.

09:49.325 --> 09:52.488
Why don't you just let him pay,
and then you can pay him back.

09:52.662 --> 09:54.960
- No, no. He won't let me do that.
- Why don't you...

09:55.131 --> 09:57.463
...put the money in his pants
pocket unsuspectingly?

09:57.633 --> 10:01.000
- He could wash them.
- We are running a reputable business.

10:01.170 --> 10:04.264
Don't tell me about business.
I sold raincoats for 35 years.

10:04.440 --> 10:08.137
- But you did not give them away.
- You don't understand...

10:08.311 --> 10:11.439
I cannot get involved with you
and your family.

10:11.614 --> 10:13.878
Okay, now, look. Don't take too long.

10:14.050 --> 10:16.245
Look at this building.
What is this?

10:16.419 --> 10:18.216
I don't know. It's a building.

10:18.387 --> 10:21.049
- The doors are on a diagonal.
- So what?

10:21.524 --> 10:24.186
It's architecturally incorrect.

10:25.094 --> 10:27.085
Just go.

10:33.336 --> 10:36.305
Is this a bad time?
I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

10:36.472 --> 10:38.872
We were about to sit down to dinner.

10:43.379 --> 10:48.840
- This is Cynthia.
- Oh, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you.

10:49.886 --> 10:51.820
- What are you having? Veal?
- No.

10:52.421 --> 10:54.821
- Looks like veal.
- It's not veal.

10:55.925 --> 10:58.257
Well, it's a good-looking
piece of meat.

10:58.628 --> 11:00.994
Wow, this is some place.
A duplex, huh?

11:01.164 --> 11:03.997
Look, stairs in an apartment.
All my life I dreamed about...

11:04.167 --> 11:08.103
...having steps in an apartment.
Even one step. Sunken living room.

11:08.671 --> 11:11.231
Although one step is not
all that sunken.

11:12.542 --> 11:16.638
- Who gave you my address?
- No, that's a fair question. It is.

11:18.114 --> 11:20.412
Jerry. Yeah. Jerry's a friend of mine.

11:20.883 --> 11:24.546
He gave it to me. Unbelievable
how many addresses this guy has.

11:24.720 --> 11:28.247
He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go
to Marlon Brando's house if I wanted.

11:28.424 --> 11:33.589
Of course, I wouldn't. The guy is...
Obviously, the guy has his problems.

11:34.463 --> 11:36.363
So you wanna talk about the show?

11:36.532 --> 11:38.557
Well, you know,
it's really very funny.

11:38.734 --> 11:41.498
Because, you know what we
got here, really?

11:41.671 --> 11:44.105
We really just have a terrible
misunderstanding. See...

11:44.273 --> 11:47.709
...when I passed on the deal, I thought
that's what Jerry wanted me to say.

11:47.877 --> 11:51.711
- I misinterpreted.
- Russell, where's the TV Guide?

11:51.881 --> 11:54.475
What time is it? 8:30. I'll tell you
what's on. You got...

11:54.650 --> 11:57.244
...Major Dad, Blossom...
Very funny program.

11:57.420 --> 11:59.718
- Blossom's on Monday.
- Are you sure?

11:59.889 --> 12:02.881
Look who I'm talking to.
The president of NBC.

12:03.059 --> 12:08.463
Mr. Costanza, it's too late anyway. I
made a deal with another writing team.

12:08.631 --> 12:11.725
All right, look.
We're people, you and me.

12:11.901 --> 12:14.426
Businessmen, colleagues, if I may.

12:14.604 --> 12:17.300
Let's not quibble.
We'll do it for the $ 13,000.

12:17.473 --> 12:20.169
Thirteen thousand, and I never
came up here. We never talked.

12:20.343 --> 12:22.743
You take good care.
It's nice seeing you again.

12:22.912 --> 12:25.176
- Nice meeting you. Cynthia, right?
- Now, look.

12:25.348 --> 12:27.873
These deals are already made.

12:28.050 --> 12:30.245
All right. Let me just say this.

12:30.686 --> 12:33.655
Ten thousand dollars. I'm going
below what you wanted to pay.

12:33.823 --> 12:36.849
You're having your dinner. Have your
veal or whatever it is. Enjoy.

12:37.026 --> 12:39.221
- Mr. Costanza.
- All right. That's it.

12:39.395 --> 12:44.094
All right. Good, $8000.
Cynthia, again, nice meeting you.

12:44.267 --> 12:48.101
Have I commented on the shoes?
I love suede. It's so thick and rich.

12:48.271 --> 12:51.468
Do you ever rub it against the grain?

12:52.074 --> 12:55.043
Russell, can we eat?

12:56.579 --> 13:00.606
- All right, 8000.
- You made Jerry very happy.

13:08.724 --> 13:11.386
Could I just use your bathroom
for a moment?

13:11.661 --> 13:16.564
All right, 200. That's as high as I can
go. I think you're being unreasonable.

13:16.732 --> 13:20.293
Jerry, I'd give you the watch.
It's not the money. I happen to like it.

13:20.469 --> 13:23.666
Look, I happen to know how much
that watch costs. It's a $60 watch.

13:23.839 --> 13:26.364
You paid 40 to get it fixed.
That's $ 100.

13:26.542 --> 13:30.808
- I'm offering you 200.
- I never seen a band like this.

13:30.980 --> 13:35.679
All right, 300. Plus 50 for the repair.
Three-fifty, that's it.

13:35.851 --> 13:37.648
Do you have it on you?

13:38.387 --> 13:40.252
Yeah, I think I do.

13:40.756 --> 13:43.816
This is unbelievable.

13:45.728 --> 13:47.923
What the hell is going on here?

13:54.303 --> 13:56.498
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

13:56.672 --> 13:58.765
- Thank you for coming in.
- Thank you.

13:58.941 --> 14:01.034
- Please sit down.
- Alrighty.

14:13.756 --> 14:16.486
Could I offer you something to drink?
Coffee, anything?

14:16.659 --> 14:21.858
Okay, yeah. I'll have a...
Do you have a decaf cappuccino?

14:23.599 --> 14:25.829
I don't think we have that.

14:26.202 --> 14:28.568
Well, that's a little strange.

14:28.738 --> 14:34.040
- Why does that surprise you?
- Well, it's a very popular drink.

14:34.510 --> 14:38.037
- This is an office.
- That's true.

14:38.748 --> 14:41.683
- But, you know, I can't help but think...
- So tell me, Mr. Kramer...

14:41.851 --> 14:43.250
Okay, sure.

14:43.786 --> 14:46.949
Tell me all about you and Elaine.

14:47.123 --> 14:49.683
Oh, alrighty...

14:52.395 --> 14:54.863
Well, what we have here,
doctor, is...

14:55.264 --> 14:58.756
...an extraordinary situation.
- Is it?

14:58.934 --> 15:00.765
Oh, you'd better believe it.

15:10.279 --> 15:12.770
You really have a terrible voice.

15:12.948 --> 15:15.041
Do I know you?

15:15.251 --> 15:18.277
- I don't think so.
- Because you really look familiar.

15:18.888 --> 15:21.618
Oh, well, maybe you've seen me.
My face is on...

15:22.124 --> 15:25.093
...Mount Rushmore.
- Yes, of course. That's it.

15:25.261 --> 15:28.594
I guess I'm just used to seeing
it on a much larger scale.

15:28.764 --> 15:31.631
Oh, yeah, right.
I replaced Teddy Roosevelt.

15:31.801 --> 15:33.268
Oh, really?

15:33.569 --> 15:37.130
Trustbuster. Bust this.

15:44.146 --> 15:46.671
You know, I never thought of it
like that before, doctor.

15:46.849 --> 15:50.410
- You are absolutely right.
- I'm glad we agree.

15:50.719 --> 15:53.085
Would you like a cigar?
They're Cubans.

15:53.255 --> 15:55.314
- I'd love one.
- Yeah.

15:55.491 --> 16:00.019
I think Elaine is a wonderful woman.
You two will make a wonderful couple.

16:02.631 --> 16:04.462
If you ever feel...

16:05.034 --> 16:07.468
...you need to talk to someone...

16:08.070 --> 16:10.231
...about anything,
you have my number.

16:10.706 --> 16:12.640
Well, that's very kind of you.

16:14.543 --> 16:16.534
These are good, huh?

16:26.355 --> 16:30.348
I cannot believe I'm doing this.
I never meet people like this.

16:30.526 --> 16:34.792
- You're not a nut, are you?
- No, I don't think so.

16:38.834 --> 16:41.428
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I never do stuff like this.

16:41.604 --> 16:46.041
Really? I give my number to just about
every customer who comes in here.

16:46.642 --> 16:48.576
- You don't seem that desperate.
- Oh, yeah.

16:48.744 --> 16:53.113
Actually I'm a little disappointed.
I kind of had my eye on Uncle Leo.

16:54.016 --> 16:56.644
Well, I'll give you a call,
and thanks for the fish.

16:56.819 --> 16:59.049
- You know why fish are so thin?
- Why?

16:59.221 --> 17:01.246
They eat fish.

17:24.413 --> 17:25.880
- Hey.
- What happened?

17:26.048 --> 17:28.073
- What took you so long?
- He's a terrific guy.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.650
What are you talking about?
What did he say?

17:30.819 --> 17:33.845
- We talked about a lot of things.
- You talked about a lot of things.

17:34.023 --> 17:36.048
Well, did you talk about us?

17:37.359 --> 17:41.489
I'm in love. I just met her outside
in the street. Her name's Elaine.

17:41.664 --> 17:44.861
She is the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen.

17:45.534 --> 17:47.434
Did you say Elaine?

17:48.571 --> 17:51.836
How come with the psychiatrist,
every "the hour" is only 50 minutes?

17:52.174 --> 17:54.938
What do they do with that
10 minutes that they have left?

17:55.110 --> 17:58.546
Do they just sit there going,
"Boy, that guy was crazy.

17:59.448 --> 18:03.111
I couldn't believe the things
he was saying. What a nut.

18:03.285 --> 18:06.186
Who's coming in next?
Oh, no, another headcase."

18:09.358 --> 18:12.122
- You should've told me it didn't work.
- I know, I know.

18:12.294 --> 18:15.593
- You didn't have to throw it out.
- I was always late. It was frustrating.

18:15.764 --> 18:17.698
I'm sorry. I really am.

18:17.866 --> 18:20.528
- That must be Leo.
- I would've taken you to the airport.

18:20.703 --> 18:22.967
- He has nothing to do.
- Neither do I.

18:23.339 --> 18:24.772
- Yeah?
- It's George.

18:24.940 --> 18:26.669
Come on up. It's George.

18:26.842 --> 18:29.709
- Oh, George.
- Whatever happened with NBC?

18:30.145 --> 18:33.273
- George turned it down.
- He turned it down?

18:33.449 --> 18:35.883
- Why did he do that?
- Because of Ted Danson.

18:36.051 --> 18:39.782
- What does he have to do with it?
- Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.

18:39.955 --> 18:42.446
Who knows? Maybe we'll wind
up getting more money.

18:42.925 --> 18:45.155
- Hey.
- Hey, Georgie boy. How are you?

18:45.327 --> 18:47.192
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
How are you?

18:47.363 --> 18:49.627
What's the matter with you?

18:49.999 --> 18:52.797
- What did I do?
- What about NBC? Hear anything?

18:52.968 --> 18:55.232
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.

18:55.938 --> 18:58.236
We got a deal.

19:00.542 --> 19:03.602
You see, he had the right idea.
Hold out.

19:03.779 --> 19:05.872
That's how you get the big money,
huh, George?

19:06.048 --> 19:09.245
- Please, Morty.
- He knows how to talk to these people.

19:09.418 --> 19:11.750
No one's gonna take advantage
of Georgie.

19:12.087 --> 19:14.885
I'm just happy to be working
with your talented son...

19:15.057 --> 19:18.959
...who is not doing this for the money.
That is so refreshing.

19:19.128 --> 19:21.153
- So, what did we get?
- Eight thousand dollars.

19:21.330 --> 19:25.130
- Beautiful.
- That's for the two of us.

19:25.567 --> 19:29.162
- Four thousand apiece?
- Let me see if I understand this.

19:29.338 --> 19:33.365
In other words,
you held out for less money.

19:33.876 --> 19:37.471
- I was wrong. You were right.
- The basic idea of negotiation...

19:37.646 --> 19:42.242
...as I understand it
is to get your price to go up.

19:43.052 --> 19:45.646
- You're smart. I'm dumb.
- This is how they negotiate...

19:45.821 --> 19:48.449
...in the Bizarro World.

19:48.624 --> 19:50.683
That's gotta be Leo.

19:50.859 --> 19:52.793
- Yeah.
- It's Leo.

19:52.961 --> 19:55.395
- All right, we're coming down.
- Let's get going.

19:55.564 --> 19:59.295
Dad, before we go,
I got a little something for you.

19:59.468 --> 20:01.629
- A present.
- A present?

20:04.039 --> 20:07.907
Hey, look at this, a wallet.
Exactly what I needed.

20:08.077 --> 20:10.045
- You see?
- Come on, you lost your wallet.

20:10.212 --> 20:13.181
- I figured I'd get you another.
- I hope you didn't spend too much.

20:13.348 --> 20:16.806
This is one of the most thoughtful
gifts anyone's ever given me.

20:16.985 --> 20:20.819
- He's something, your son, isn't he?
- All right. Let's go.

20:20.989 --> 20:24.015
- You're a terrific kid.
- Yeah, he's something, isn't he?

20:24.193 --> 20:26.661
How can anybody not like you?

20:27.096 --> 20:29.030
- You're very special.
- Yeah.

20:29.198 --> 20:31.666
I'm good for about $4000.

20:32.434 --> 20:37.371
- Hey, let's go. It's 12:22.
- All right, Leo.

20:37.539 --> 20:40.440
- Hey, Uncle Leo. How you doing?
- Hi, hi. I got it.

20:40.609 --> 20:43.510
This is some beautiful parking spot
you've got here.

20:43.679 --> 20:45.647
- I hate to give it up.
- Yeah.

20:45.814 --> 20:47.714
Dad, you're sure you don't
need more money?

20:47.883 --> 20:50.215
- Jerry.
- All right, I'm just joking.

20:50.385 --> 20:51.943
Listen, have a nice trip.

20:52.121 --> 20:56.251
- Bye, Mrs. Seinfeld. Take care.
- Thanks again for the wallet.

20:56.425 --> 20:58.757
- Morty, always a pleasure.
- Yes.

20:58.927 --> 21:01.259
Take care, now. So long.

21:02.030 --> 21:06.057
- Yeah, like he'd take your money.
- He took it. I put $400 in the wallet.

21:06.235 --> 21:09.068
He lost all that cash. It was the
only way I could give it back.

21:09.238 --> 21:13.971
- Otherwise, he wouldn't accept it.
- I'd love to see the look on his face.

21:16.378 --> 21:18.403
- You believe this?
- What?

21:18.580 --> 21:20.741
- It's Velcro.
- You're kidding.

21:20.916 --> 21:24.818
Who needs this? Leo, let's go.

21:39.134 --> 21:43.537
The main difference between women's
and men's wallets is the photo section.

21:44.006 --> 21:47.840
True? Women carry with them a photo
of every person they've ever met...

21:48.010 --> 21:51.173
...every day in their whole life
since the beginning of time.

21:51.346 --> 21:53.541
Every picture's out of date.
You know what I mean?

21:53.715 --> 21:57.048
"Here's my cousin, 3 years old.
She's in the Marines now.

21:57.219 --> 22:00.985
This is my dog. He died during
the Johnson administration."

22:01.390 --> 22:03.881
You get stopped by a cop.
No license, no registration.

22:04.059 --> 22:06.220
"Here's 56 people that know me."

22:07.196 --> 22:10.757
Cop goes, "Just wanted to make sure
you had some friends. Move it along.

22:11.333 --> 22:13.267
Routine pal check."
