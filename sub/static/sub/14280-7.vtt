Well, gang, looks like I'm gonna
have to order a new tongue,

Oh, but that'll take weeks,

14:05.378 --> 14:07.848
and you can't cook
if you can't taste anything!

14:07.881 --> 14:10.684
I know! I guess
I'll have to find somebody

14:10.717 --> 14:12.185

Oh, for goodness sake, Chowder,
See, the tongue is a muscle

So no more sneeze burgers?
