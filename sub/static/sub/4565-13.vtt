WEBVTT

00:04.871 --> 00:08.273
Graduation and awards night
is coming up.

00:08.275 --> 00:10.743
I am very proud
of this class.

00:10.745 --> 00:11.944
Several of you
will be recognized

00:11.946 --> 00:17.282
Awards are a scam!
A girl like me never had
a chance, matthews.

00:17.284 --> 00:18.617
Never had a chance.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.322
All right, I'll do it,
but it's ridiculous.

00:23.324 --> 00:26.525
It's a scam, matthews!
She never had a chance!

00:27.927 --> 00:29.895
Maya will be receiving

00:29.897 --> 00:33.265
The griff hawkins
totally cool award.

00:33.267 --> 00:37.970
Maya, you just found out
you won the totally cool award,

00:37.972 --> 00:39.304
Yet you just sit there?

00:40.340 --> 00:41.974
Oh, you're being cool.

00:43.309 --> 00:45.511
Why won't you
rub off on me?

00:46.613 --> 00:47.913
And our two finalists

00:47.915 --> 00:50.315
For the scholar athlete
award are...

00:50.317 --> 00:52.651
Lucas friar...

00:52.653 --> 00:54.820
And billy ross.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.922
I hope you're ready
for some competition, dude.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.525
Oh, well, you know
how I hate competition.

00:59.527 --> 01:00.926
( both laugh )

01:02.028 --> 01:04.263
( both chuckle )

01:05.899 --> 01:08.767
Hey, golden boys,
you wanna hop down from
your cloud of awesomeness?

01:08.769 --> 01:10.803
You're making
us normals feel bad.

01:10.805 --> 01:14.239
Yeah.  Right after
our handshake of awesomeness.

01:22.015 --> 01:23.682
( grunts )

01:24.884 --> 01:26.919
Every day.

01:26.921 --> 01:29.655
Girls should have
their own handshake
of awesomeness.

01:29.657 --> 01:30.722
What would it be?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.993
Both:
Stop it.

01:37.564 --> 01:39.665
Farkle,
you are being awarded

01:39.667 --> 01:42.267
The joseph t.R. Epstein
confidence award.

01:42.269 --> 01:45.337
Congratulations.
Farkle?

01:45.339 --> 01:47.306
Farkle's voice:
<i>Farkle can't come</i>
<i>to his desk right now.</i>

01:47.308 --> 01:49.274
<i>If you have a question</i>
<i>for farkle, say, "one;"</i>

01:49.276 --> 01:52.611
<i>A comment, say, "two;"</i>
<i>billing questions, "three."</i>

01:52.613 --> 01:55.914
- One.  Where are you?
-  <i>You have selected "three."</i>

01:55.916 --> 01:57.816
No, I said, "one."

01:57.818 --> 02:00.953
<i>Sorry, we are experiencing</i>
<i>unusually high call volume.</i>

02:00.955 --> 02:02.788
<i>Your call will be answered</i>
<i>in approximately...</i>

02:02.790 --> 02:04.790
- Man's voice:  <i>35...</i>
<i>- Farkle: </i> <i>Minutes.</i>

02:04.792 --> 02:08.327
-  <i>( acoustic guitar</i>
<i>music playing )</i>
<i>- representative!</i>

02:10.330 --> 02:12.931
What is this?
Farkle's never missed
a class in his life.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.800
<i>( school bell rings )</i>

02:21.975 --> 02:23.742
Yes?

02:24.744 --> 02:26.845
Everybody's getting
an award but me.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.981
What good is having you
as my teacher

02:28.983 --> 02:30.382
If the fix ain't in?!

02:31.084 --> 02:32.818
I'm sorry, riley.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.920
Riley, you don't
need a trophy

02:34.922 --> 02:36.088
To make you feel
good about yourself.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.456
Yes, I do.

02:37.458 --> 02:40.025
Sometimes I feel
kind of invisible.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.060
Farkle:
<i>Sometimes you want</i>
<i>to be invisible, riley,</i>

02:42.062 --> 02:43.829
<i>Believe me.</i>

My congratulations

03:41.789 --> 03:43.522
On your
confidence
award.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.424
Will you be leaving
the luxury

03:45.426 --> 03:47.526
Of my custodial
suite now?

03:48.895 --> 03:50.462
You think I'm
hiding out,
don't you?

03:50.464 --> 03:51.863
Well, farkle
doesn't hide out
from anyone...

03:51.865 --> 03:52.898
Except my
aunt barbara.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.499
She's a
lip-kisser.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.401
You're avoiding
someone, farkle.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.869
What happened?

03:57.871 --> 03:58.937
I don't
really think
it's something

03:58.939 --> 04:00.906
You can relate to,
janitor harley.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.808
Oh, right,
because

04:02.810 --> 04:03.942
I would never
understand

04:03.944 --> 04:05.010
How cruel kids
could be

04:05.012 --> 04:06.445
To each
other, right?

04:06.447 --> 04:07.980
You were like
me as a kid?

04:07.982 --> 04:09.448
I just know what
you might

04:09.450 --> 04:10.782
Be dealing
with is all.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.518
I'm not proud
of how I know...

04:13.520 --> 04:16.121
( sighs )
but I know.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.425
I looked in the library.
He's not there.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.194
Hey, guys,
I checked the ball field.

04:22.196 --> 04:24.963
- No farkle.
- You looked on the baseball
field for farkle?

04:24.965 --> 04:26.632
Billy, are you even trying?

04:26.634 --> 04:28.166
- Not really.
-  <i>( door opens )</i>

04:30.003 --> 04:32.137
Troubled lad,
I now release you

04:32.139 --> 04:34.506
To the hands
of your caring friends,

04:34.508 --> 04:36.742
'cause they...
Have time for this.

04:37.877 --> 04:40.479
You wanna tell us
what's going on here, buddy?

04:40.481 --> 04:43.015
- Are you my buddy?
- What?

04:43.017 --> 04:46.551
- Spill it, farkle.
- Somebody made fun
of my turtlenecks.

04:46.553 --> 04:50.022
- Your turtlenecks?
- Yeah, somebody said
they make me weird.

04:50.024 --> 04:52.958
- You are weird.
- She doesn't mean that.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.827
Sure, I do.
He knows he is.
He embraces it.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.763
But you already
know that, farkle.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.097
That's what
makes you unique.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.565
What good
is being unique

05:00.567 --> 05:02.701
If somebody knows
you're really not?

05:09.075 --> 05:11.576
Look at everything
we've accomplished
in our lives:

05:11.578 --> 05:14.146
- A beautiful daughter...
- I did that.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.814
...Who's spending
the night at maya's...

05:15.816 --> 05:19.151
A wonderful son who's hanging
with his grandparents.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.887
I just love the kids so much,
I don't even know what to do.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.655
Me too.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.058
Both:
Yay!  We're alone!

05:27.960 --> 05:29.961
Mmm! ( giggles )
oh good.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.797
I still like it.

05:32.965 --> 05:34.666
Guess who it is!

05:34.668 --> 05:37.002
♪ it's ava

05:37.004 --> 05:40.972

05:40.974 --> 05:42.741
Yay!

05:46.012 --> 05:48.714
How is this happening?

05:48.716 --> 05:52.584
- How?!
- Uh, ava, auggie isn't
here right now.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.853
My mother said
you'd be happy to watch me

05:54.855 --> 05:57.622
While she tells my daddy
what he is doing wrong.

05:58.958 --> 06:03.128
- How long does that take?
- It's supposed to stop?

06:04.764 --> 06:06.631
We have to do this,
don't we?

06:06.633 --> 06:09.101
( chuckles )
we're stuck!

06:09.103 --> 06:13.538
And tonight you can't
pick me up and say, "whee!"

06:13.540 --> 06:16.174
And put me outside.
And I say, "but...!"

06:16.176 --> 06:18.143
And then you slam
the door in my face...

06:18.145 --> 06:20.679
Even though
I love that!

06:22.115 --> 06:24.015
But I want to.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.051
Maybe later.
But right now,

06:26.053 --> 06:28.787
Make room for...

06:43.137 --> 06:44.236
Try again.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.204
Freed ireland.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.073
Freed india.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.642
Before or after
he freed ireland?

06:52.745 --> 06:55.113
Jackie robinson.
What'd he do?

06:55.115 --> 06:57.616
First irish guy to play
in the major leagues

06:57.618 --> 06:59.017
After gandhi freed 'em.

07:01.954 --> 07:04.790
I-- I quit.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.825
Farkle:
<i>But you can't quit, sir!</i>

07:06.827 --> 07:08.894
And you need to be
in my class, farkle.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.729
How long are
you gonna be out sick?

07:10.731 --> 07:11.997
<i>Don't know.</i>
<i>( coughs )</i>

07:11.999 --> 07:13.965
<i>Pretty bad cold, sir.</i>

07:13.967 --> 07:16.034
Okay.  Feel better.

07:17.136 --> 07:19.938
- What about her?
- That's malala.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.041
The taliban doesn't think
that women should be educated.

07:23.043 --> 07:26.244
She stood up to them
and became the first
teenager ever

07:26.246 --> 07:28.980
To be nominated
for a nobel peace prize.

07:28.982 --> 07:32.083
Sometimes the world
presents you with opportunities

07:32.085 --> 07:36.021
Will you have the courage
to stand up to someone

07:36.023 --> 07:37.856
Who tries to take
your spirit away?

07:41.260 --> 07:43.995
- May I be excused?
- For what?

07:43.997 --> 07:47.332
The world has presented me
with an opportunity.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.272
( sighs )
farkle.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.807
Nobody in this school

07:55.809 --> 07:59.077
Get back into the classroom
where you belong.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.012
Nobody gets
to crush your spirit.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.715
My spirit's fine.
I just don't want
to be me anymore.

08:03.717 --> 08:06.251
Why?  Because somebody
said something about
what you wear?

08:06.253 --> 08:08.954
Stupid reason.
Stupid shirt.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.189
Stupid, stupid,
stupid shirt.

08:12.825 --> 08:16.228
- It isn't you.
- You can have these,
janitor harley.

08:16.230 --> 08:17.963
I'm done
with turtlenecks.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.364
Aw, jeez.
Thanks, kid.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.433
They won't fit me.

08:21.435 --> 08:25.270
Oh, it's a good thing--
they're horrible.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.842
Farkle, this isn't you.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.110
This isn't
the farkle I know.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.179
And I want to know why
and I want to know now.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.882
He said I was
the biggest nothing
in this school.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.150
- What?
- He said I had no right

08:39.152 --> 08:40.752
To walk around
acting all confident

08:40.754 --> 08:42.087
And pretending like
people liked me.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.788
He said I had no right
to have friends like you,

08:43.790 --> 08:45.924
Because I was
the biggest nothing
in this school.

08:52.832 --> 08:55.867
Farkle, it's not okay that
somebody called you that.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.469
Kids can be very cruel.

08:57.471 --> 09:00.105
I know this
from personal experience.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.439
You were
picked on as a kid?

09:01.441 --> 09:05.343
No, I was
the other one,
the picker-on-er.

09:05.345 --> 09:08.480
I'm so ashamed.
Just-- just look away.

09:11.450 --> 09:14.786
Somebody told farkle
that he doesn't deserve
us as friends.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.154
- Who?
- It's not important.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.156
It's the most important thing
in the world.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.392
I'll find him myself
and I'd hate to be him
when I do.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.829
Am I there yet?

09:26.766 --> 09:28.867
Farkle, don't let what
anybody says get to you.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.001
That's what
gives them power.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.237
Why are you my friend?

09:32.239 --> 09:34.039
What is it with that?

09:34.041 --> 09:35.840
( sighs )
farkle...

09:35.842 --> 09:37.876
Would you just
come back to class?

09:37.878 --> 09:40.045
Pippi longstockings
is right.

09:41.013 --> 09:43.148
I, janitor harley keiner,

09:43.150 --> 09:46.151
Was in my youth
a school meanie.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.987
And someone
you all know and love

09:48.989 --> 09:51.790
Was often the target
of my shenanigans.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.959
But his will was
so strong,

09:53.961 --> 09:56.761
It changed the nature
of our relationship forever.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.164
In fact,
he even got me this job,

09:59.166 --> 10:02.100
And now I hold him
in the highest esteem.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.804
Hey, johnny baboon!

10:06.973 --> 10:08.873
Kids:
Johnny baboon?

10:08.875 --> 10:11.910
- You promised me!
- Oops.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.180
Farkle, you're here.

10:15.182 --> 10:18.116
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, sir.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.152
Good.  Then I'll see you
in my class tomorrow morning.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.153
Yes sir.

10:25.324 --> 10:29.060
Hey, baboon.
You're a pretty scary dude.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.162
I learned from the best.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.931
Yeah, I was the best.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.533
Now give me
your lunch money.

10:35.535 --> 10:38.003
I'm a teacher.
I don't have any.

10:45.544 --> 10:48.480
This is a very special
place to us, lucas.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.449
This is where
riley and I figure out
our most important stuff.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.284
Do you ever
talk about me here?

10:53.286 --> 10:55.186
( gasps )
what do I do now?

10:55.188 --> 10:57.188
I don't know
what to do.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.190
Start over
and move on.

10:59.192 --> 11:02.494
( chuckles )
this is a very special
place to us, lucas.

11:04.063 --> 11:05.463
Do you ever
talk about me here?

11:06.399 --> 11:08.099
You gave me
bad advice!

11:09.969 --> 11:11.936
Well, I appreciate
you having me here.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.238
Whatever farkle's
dealing with,

11:13.240 --> 11:15.206
He shouldn't have
to go through it alone.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.909
I want my farkle back.
We're not as good
without him.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.178
If you tell him I said that,
I will jack you up, son.

11:21.113 --> 11:22.213
<i>( door opens )</i>

11:23.516 --> 11:25.250
Ah, the brain trust.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.152
You guys have one day

11:27.154 --> 11:28.887
To figure this out
and fix farkle

11:28.889 --> 11:30.188
Or else you come
to an adult.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.322
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.858
- Yes, dad.
- Yes, mr. Matthews.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.293
If we could just find out
who this guy was,

11:35.295 --> 11:37.062
Then I know
you'd take care of him.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.030
What?  Beat him up?

11:39.032 --> 11:42.100
Maya, all those people
on the blackboard

11:42.102 --> 11:44.035
Never became like the people
who were attacking them

11:44.037 --> 11:45.603
By resorting
to their methods.

11:45.605 --> 11:48.540
It's just not
the first response
of an intelligent person.

11:50.476 --> 11:52.177
Get out!

11:53.979 --> 11:56.214
( grunts )

11:59.552 --> 12:01.486
That--
that felt really good.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.034
- Where's farkle?
- I thought he said

12:16.036 --> 12:17.335
He wasn't going
to miss anymore classes.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.137
Then why haven't
we seen him?

12:19.139 --> 12:22.574
Oh.  Hey, man.
Baseball after school?

12:22.576 --> 12:26.244
My buddy's still being hassled
and I wanna be there for him.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.680
Your buddy?
You mean farkle?

12:28.682 --> 12:31.316
- Yeah, nobody's seen him.
- You're better off.

12:33.052 --> 12:35.186
- Excuse me?
- ( scoffs )
come on, lucas.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.122
I don't really see
farkle as your buddy.

12:37.124 --> 12:40.158
- Why not?
- You don't think
he's different than us?

12:40.160 --> 12:42.227
What do you mean?
Smarter?

12:42.229 --> 12:43.962
Yeah, he's the smartest kid
in school,

12:43.964 --> 12:45.430
- But he doesn't make
a big deal about it.
- ( sighs )

12:45.432 --> 12:48.032
I mean, he does wanna
take over the world
and everything,

12:48.034 --> 12:51.069
But frankly,
I'd like to see
what he does with it.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.239
Lucas, farkle is
a nothing.

13:02.481 --> 13:03.948
You're the one
who did this to farkle?

13:03.950 --> 13:05.183
Why would you do that
to a guy like him?

13:05.185 --> 13:07.318
I don't know.
'cause he's a guy like him.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.721
You wanna let me go now?

13:09.723 --> 13:12.390
- You're the nothing, billy!
- Lucas, don't.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.192
I thought this is
what you wanted, maya.

13:14.194 --> 13:17.695
What?  She wanted you
to pop me, mr. Perfect?

13:17.697 --> 13:20.064
Well, I don't think
that's what he's gonna do.

13:20.066 --> 13:22.367
Yeah. ( chuckles )
no, that's what
I'm gonna do.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.502
No!
That's what he wants.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.137
He wants you
to be like him.

13:26.139 --> 13:30.275
- ( groans )
- you see, lucas is like me.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.011
We live in a cloud
of awesomeness, remember?

13:33.013 --> 13:34.245
Handshake?

13:36.582 --> 13:38.183
I don't like you
like this.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.484
This isn't
the billy I know.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.586
And I wanna know why
and I wanna know now.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.521
And would you
get off my back?

13:44.723 --> 13:46.324
Come one, man,
the billy you know

13:46.326 --> 13:48.593
Is your teammate,
and that comes way before

13:48.595 --> 13:50.228
Whatever these guys
are to you.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.231
- "these guys?"
- boy, are you wrong.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.266
These guys are
my friends...

13:55.268 --> 13:58.369
All the time,
not just on the field.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.371
How are you even friends
with that little guy?

14:00.373 --> 14:02.307
Because I can
depend on him,

14:02.309 --> 14:04.442
Because he's
the most loyal person
I've ever met,

14:04.444 --> 14:06.477
Because he's
my best friend.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.513
Farkle:
<i>You really mean that?</i>

14:10.115 --> 14:12.250
You're my best friend, too!

14:12.252 --> 14:14.419
Farkle, how'd
you get up there?

14:14.421 --> 14:16.254
I thought you couldn't
climb the ropes.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.489
I can't!
But in desperate situations,

14:18.491 --> 14:20.225
Apparently I can fly!

14:22.695 --> 14:23.761
You really don't
wanna be friends

14:23.763 --> 14:25.196
With a goofball
like that?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.464
Not really, no.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.499
Let me
ask you something.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.134
What's wrong with you?

14:30.136 --> 14:32.203
There's nothing
wrong with me.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.504
I've never actually
seen you hang out

14:33.506 --> 14:35.240
With anybody that
isn't on the team.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.075
Dude, whatever.
I don't need this.

14:37.077 --> 14:40.144
You don't?  Too bad.
Because friends like
farkle don't just

14:40.146 --> 14:42.046
- Fall out of thin air.
- ( screams )

14:43.582 --> 14:46.251
You can have him.
You'll figure out
sooner or later

14:46.253 --> 14:48.553
- That they're not us.
- Who's "us?"

14:51.457 --> 14:54.459
Nice.  That's exactly
the way I used to think.

14:55.427 --> 14:58.129
Now here I am...
With a mop.

14:59.164 --> 15:00.632
( sighs )

15:02.301 --> 15:06.237
Okay, we're done.
It's all over.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.273
Nothing more to do
except carry on

15:08.275 --> 15:10.675
With our simple,
middle-school lives.

15:11.610 --> 15:13.244
Except...

15:15.347 --> 15:17.315
What are we gonna do
about billy?

15:17.317 --> 15:19.384
Riley, you can't
fix everything.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.520
Okay, go ahead.

15:24.456 --> 15:26.524
( sighs )

15:26.526 --> 15:28.326
I almost died.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.261
I know, buddy.

15:35.701 --> 15:38.803
I don't even think
billy thinks he did
anything wrong.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.739
Yeah.
Where's that come from?

15:41.741 --> 15:43.308
Girls, at this age,

15:43.310 --> 15:45.209
You're just finding out
who you are.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.811
I mean, people don't
usually walk around

15:46.813 --> 15:48.346
Wearing signs
that tell you.

15:49.381 --> 15:51.349
Here I am!

15:52.351 --> 15:54.185
Oh, what do I know?

15:55.421 --> 15:57.188
Where's my brekkie?

15:57.190 --> 15:58.756
Oh joy.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.660
And none of that
toaster pastry.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.296
Everyone knows that's
a shortcut, topanga.

16:06.598 --> 16:09.233
Why don't you love us?

16:14.740 --> 16:16.174
Uh-oh.

16:19.445 --> 16:22.647
- What was that for?
- Never change, ava.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.349
- ( chuckles )
- you know,

16:24.351 --> 16:26.150
If you ever wanted
to kiss me again,

16:26.152 --> 16:28.619
I wouldn't stop you.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.689
You be exactly
who you are, ava.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.359
You wear it proudly.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.462
Was that
for my benefit, mom?

16:37.464 --> 16:39.430
How ya doin'?

16:41.433 --> 16:43.267
Riley, you can't
fix everything.

16:44.236 --> 16:45.803
Okay, go ahead.

16:57.716 --> 17:01.319
- What's going on?
- Riley made us write
on our heads!

17:03.922 --> 17:06.557
- Riley?
- Insecure.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.959
It's always
mattered more to me

17:07.961 --> 17:10.728
What my friends think
about me than what I think.

17:11.797 --> 17:14.432
- Maya?
- When I own it,

17:14.434 --> 17:16.968
It doesn't make me
feel so bad.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.669
Good.

17:18.671 --> 17:22.206
So, before someone
can use our own flaws
against us,

17:22.208 --> 17:24.442
Maybe it would help us
to admit we all have 'em.

17:30.682 --> 17:32.750
You going somewhere,
mr. Ross?

17:32.752 --> 17:34.318
Trying to be invisible?

17:35.554 --> 17:37.288
Believe me,
it doesn't help.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.226
You know, billy,

17:42.228 --> 17:44.929
You seem to be
the only one here
not wearing a flaw.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.497
Do you not have any?

17:46.499 --> 17:48.733
Well, none I know of.

17:49.968 --> 17:52.403
What made you treat farkle
the way you did?

17:52.405 --> 17:56.007
Yeah.  We never thought
of you this way, billy.

17:56.009 --> 17:58.342
I always thought of you
as the good guy.

17:58.344 --> 18:01.012
Look, I like people
who are...

18:01.014 --> 18:02.613
Like me.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.649
Is that a flaw?
Because I don't think so.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.251
Kids: Yes.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.386
You don't think I know

18:08.388 --> 18:10.288
I'll never be
a genius freak like you?

18:11.490 --> 18:13.257
I shouldn't
make fun of that?

18:13.259 --> 18:15.860
( scoffs )
stop making me feel bad.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.262
I already feel bad enough
you got such great friends.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.698
And that makes me feel...

18:21.834 --> 18:24.335
I don't know.
Is there a word for that?

18:25.637 --> 18:27.638
You're jealous.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.342
- But you're billy ross.
- ( scoffs ) yeah.

18:31.344 --> 18:34.479
I'm billy ross.
Jealous of you?

18:34.481 --> 18:36.581
<i>Of him?</i>

18:36.583 --> 18:39.383
Because this
little guy doesn't need
to hit a baseball to...

18:39.385 --> 18:40.985
Have friends?

18:42.454 --> 18:43.988
Does that sound
like jealousy to you?

18:45.757 --> 18:47.358
Let me see that.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.646
Welcome to the team.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.581
Thanks.
Glad to be here.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.518
We're all human beings.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.987
We're all
on the same team.

19:15.989 --> 19:20.057
And if we sense
our own flaws because
we see them in others...

19:21.960 --> 19:24.462
It's true friends
who help us wipe them away.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.582
I'm sorry, farkle.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.884
Any friend
of lucas should be
a friend of mine.

19:55.894 --> 19:57.962
Thanks.  Want me
to get rid of yours?

19:57.964 --> 19:59.730
No, I just got mine.
I think I'd better

19:59.732 --> 20:01.832
Try to understand it
a little bit more.

20:03.068 --> 20:05.102
- Can we do the handshake?
- ( scoffs ) dude.

20:05.104 --> 20:06.704
You think you're ready
for the handshake?

20:06.706 --> 20:08.573
I'm so ready
for the handshake.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.053
Well, I don't
understand anything.

20:26.925 --> 20:30.161
- Mr. Matthews?
- Mr. Perfect.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.030
Will my friend
be all right?

20:35.434 --> 20:37.068
I believe
these belong to you.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.669
Thanks,
janitor harley.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.104
( clicks tongue )

20:44.042 --> 20:46.143
This is mr. Matthews.

20:50.882 --> 20:54.418
Yeah.  People change.

20:59.524 --> 21:02.994
Well, we've given out
our award for confidence...

21:04.596 --> 21:06.964
- Cool...
- 'sup?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.901
...And we've acknowledged
our scholar athlete.

21:11.837 --> 21:14.038
- Jealous?
- Yeah...

21:14.040 --> 21:15.473
But I'm working on it

21:15.475 --> 21:17.074
You okay, riles?

21:17.076 --> 21:19.010
I know getting an award
was a big deal for you.

21:19.012 --> 21:21.178
I'm okay.  Really.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.715
And now for our final
award of the evening.

21:24.717 --> 21:27.051
The john quincy adams
spirit award

21:27.053 --> 21:28.986
Goes to the student
with the courage

21:28.988 --> 21:30.988
To stand up
for what they believe in

21:30.990 --> 21:32.890
And changes
for the better.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.059
Now the award is voted on
by the student body,

21:35.061 --> 21:38.029
So we have
no idea in advance
who will win.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.601
Huh.

21:48.073 --> 21:49.674
Proud.

21:51.109 --> 21:53.077
Riley
matthews.

21:53.079 --> 21:57.081
Maya, how do
I act cool
about this?

21:57.083 --> 21:59.750
You?  Just be
who you are.

22:00.952 --> 22:02.887
Yay!
