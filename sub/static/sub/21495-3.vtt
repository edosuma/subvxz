00:05.640 --> 00:08.241
So, Jon, when did your interest
in Comrade Detective begin?

00:08.308 --> 00:11.445
Oh, when I was doing my
documentary on Stanley Kubrick.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.013
It's called Stanley Kubrick's Boxes.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.015
I actually found a copy
of Comrade Detective

00:16.082 --> 00:17.350
in one of his boxes.

00:17.417 --> 00:19.119
- Come on. No way.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.120
Kubrick had a copy.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.022
There's one mention of Comrade Detective

00:22.089 --> 00:26.026
in his diaries, from March 13, 1991.

00:26.093 --> 00:29.029
He wrote, "We watched episode three

00:29.096 --> 00:31.632
of Comrade Detective over dinner."

00:31.699 --> 00:34.401
So, Stanley Kubrick was a fan?

00:34.468 --> 00:36.570
A fan and a student. Yeah.

00:36.637 --> 00:37.971
Wow. That's crazy.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.173
- Should we keep watching?
- Absolutely.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.587
And why exactly didn't
you inform on him?

09:21.028 --> 09:24.031
How about a slice of bread?

09:28.335 --> 09:29.369
Hmm.

09:32.239 --> 09:36.176
Marku spoke often about
transubstantiation.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.345
Are you gents familiar with the term?

09:38.411 --> 09:41.114
Yeah. Transubstantiation.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.416
In countries that are slaves
to the Christian faith,

09:43.483 --> 09:45.718
they eat bread during
ritualized worship.

09:45.785 --> 09:47.054
They believe that the bread

09:47.120 --> 09:49.389
literally turns into the body of Christ.

09:49.456 --> 09:50.557
Correct.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.430
and the next moment, that
very same bread is transformed

09:57.497 --> 10:00.100
into the flesh of Jesus Christ.

10:00.167 --> 10:03.002

lived up to his end.

Got it?

31:42.434 --> 31:43.602
Good.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.673

May God bless you, comrades.

31:59.184 --> 32:01.687
Hey, Father.

32:02.888 --> 32:05.090
You know why Jesus
wasn't born in the West?

32:06.558 --> 32:08.794
Enlighten me, Detective.

32:08.860 --> 32:12.498
Because they couldn't find
three wise men or a virgin.
