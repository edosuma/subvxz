THESE WHITE BATHTUB RINGS, IS
THIS WHERE THE WATER USED TO BE?

TONIGHT, THE MAN YOU ARE
ABOUT
TO MEET SAYS A SECOND SAUDI

02:18.538 --> 02:23.176
ASSASSINATION TEAM WAS SENT
TO
KILL HIM IN CANADA.

02:23.243 --> 02:27.180
SAAD ALJABRI WAS NUMBER TWO
IN
SAUDI INTELLIGENCE, AND HE
WAS

02:27.247 --> 02:30.917
AMONG THE BEST FRIENDS
AMERICA
HAD AGAINST TERRORISM.

02:30.984 --> 02:35.188
NOW, SAAD IS ASKING
AMERICA'S
HELP.

02:35.255 --> 02:38.491
TRUTH IS HARD TO TRIANGULATE
AMONG SPIES, DESPOTS, AND
THE

02:38.558 --> 02:39.192
MIDDLE EAST.

02:39.259 --> 02:43.229
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR THAT
SAAD
ALJABRI MAY NOT BE SPOTLESS.

02:43.296 --> 02:48.468
BUT AS A SPYMASTER, SAAD SAYS HE
HAS ONE MORE FAVOR FOR AMERICA:

02:48.535 --> 02:54.407
A WARNING ABOUT A PRINCE, WITH
THE POWER TO TROUBLE THE WORLD.

02:54.474 --> 03:00.513

HERE
TO SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT A

TALKING ABOUT MOHAMMED BIN

SALMAN, WHO SEIZED POWER BEHIND
THE BACK OF THE MAN GREETING

03:23.303 --> 03:24.537
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

03:24.604 --> 03:30.543
THAT'S MOHAMMED BIN NAYEF, THEN
HEIR TO THE THRONE.

03:30.610 --> 03:35.248
BUT IN 2017, NAYEF WAS ARRESTED
BY PRINCE MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN.

03:35.315 --> 03:36.516
A PSYCHOPATH?

03:36.583 --> 03:42.455
>> Saad Aljabri: A
PSYCHOPATH
WITH NO EMPATHY.

03:42.522 --> 03:47.260
DOESN'T FEEL EMOTION, NEVER
LEARNED FROM HIS EXPERIENCE.

03:47.327 --> 03:53.533
AND WE HAVE WITNESSED ATROCITIES
AND CRIMES COMMITTED BY THIS

03:53.600 --> 03:54.534
KILLER.

>> Pelley: A SOURCE FROM
U.S.

03:55.301 --> 03:59.238
INTELLIGENCE TOLD US, SAAD
ALJABRI WOULD NEVER SHOW UP FOR

03:59.305 --> 04:00.607
THIS INTERVIEW.

04:00.673 --> 04:05.912
HE'D LIVED TOO LONG IN A SILENT
PROFESSION.

04:05.979 --> 04:09.515
THE FACT THAT HE DID SHOW UP IS
A MEASURE OF HIS DESPERATION.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.585
SAAD IS 62, MARRIED, EIGHT
CHILDREN.

04:12.652 --> 04:18.591
HE STARTED AS A COP, BUT ROSE TO
THE TOP OF SAUDI INTELLIGENCE

04:18.658 --> 04:23.062
AND EARNED A Ph.D IN THE SCIENCE
OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

04:23.129 --> 04:27.233
HE COULD BE SEEN IN THE
OVAL OFFICE, WITH AMERICAN

04:27.300 --> 04:30.069
AMBASSADORS, THE U.S.
MILITARY
COMMAND, AND WITH MICHAEL

04:30.136 --> 04:32.739
MORELL, FORMER ACTING
DIRECTOR
OF THE C.I.A.

04:32.805 --> 04:36.609
>> Michael Morell: I'M A BIG
ADMIRER.

04:36.676 --> 04:39.312
I FOUND DR. SAAD TO BE
EXTRAORDINARILY BRIGHT.

04:39.379 --> 04:42.548
I FOUND HIM TO BE INCREDIBLY
LOYAL TO HIS COUNTRY.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.283
>> Pelley: WOULD YOU SAY
HONORABLE?

04:44.350 --> 04:47.387
>> Morell: HONORABLE, YES,
ABSOLUTELY.

04:47.453 --> 04:52.992
>> Pelley: BUT IN 2017, SAAD
FOUND HIMSELF ON THE WRONG SIDE

04:53.059 --> 04:53.793
OF PRINCE MOHAMMED'S COUP.

04:53.860 --> 04:58.031
THE DEPOSED PRINCE NAYEF WAS
SAAD'S BOSS.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.667
SAAD FLED TO CANADA, WHERE HE
REMAINS, AND REFUSES TO RETURN.

05:00.733 --> 05:06.673
NOW, PRINCE MOHAMMED IS
MAKING
SAAD'S FAMILY PAY.

05:06.739 --> 05:10.843
THE VERY DAY OF THE COUP, TWO OF
HIS CHILDREN WERE BARRED FROM

05:10.910 --> 05:11.377
LEAVING THE KINGDOM.

05:11.444 --> 05:15.381
THIS IS HIS DAUGHTER, SARAH.

BOTH PLANNED TO BE IN
AMERICAN
COLLEGES.

05:23.456 --> 05:27.193
THEY ARE NOW IN SAUDI
PRISONS.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.428
NEXT, THE FAMILY SAYS,
PRINCE
MOHAMMED TARGETED SAAD'S

05:28.494 --> 05:30.830
SON-IN-LAW.

05:30.897 --> 05:35.368
THEY CLAIM THE SON-IN-LAW WAS
KIDNAPPED IN A THIRD COUNTRY AND

05:35.435 --> 05:36.669
RETURNED TO THE KINGDOM.

05:36.736 --> 05:39.772
>> Khalid Aljabri: THE FIRST
NIGHT HE WAS KIDNAPPED, HE

05:39.839 --> 05:42.675
RECEIVED MORE THAN 100
LASHES.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.711
HE WAS TORTURED.

05:44.777 --> 05:47.380
HE WAS BEATEN ON HIS BACK,
ON
HIS LEGS.

05:47.447 --> 05:51.184
>> Pelley: KHALID ALJABRI IS
SAAD'S ELDEST SON.

05:51.250 --> 05:54.620
WHAT WAS HE TOLD HE WAS
BEING
DETAINED FOR?

05:54.687 --> 05:57.824
>> Khalid Aljabri: HE WAS BEING
TOLD THAT HE WAS DETAINED AND

05:57.890 --> 06:00.693
TORTURED AS A PROXY FOR HIS
FATHER-IN-LAW, MEANING MY
DAD.

06:00.760 --> 06:05.064
THEY EVEN ASKED HIM A QUESTION,
"WHO DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD

06:05.131 --> 06:08.568
ARREST AND TORTURE, SO DR. SAAD
CAN COME BACK TO THE KINGDOM?"

06:08.634 --> 06:11.804

IN 2018, A YEAR AFTER HIS COUP,
U.S. INTELLIGENCE SAYS PRINCE

06:23.015 --> 06:24.751
MOHAMMAD SENT A TEAM TO
TURKEY
TO LURE KHASHOGGI TO A SAUDI

06:24.817 --> 06:30.356
CONSULATE AND DISMEMBER HIM.

06:30.423 --> 06:33.593
SAAD TOLD US THAT, DAYS
LATER,
BEFORE KHASHOGGI'S MURDER
WAS

06:33.659 --> 06:36.763
KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC, HE RECEIVED
A WARNING.

06:36.829 --> 06:39.866
A FRIEND IN A MIDDLE EASTERN
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE SAID

06:39.932 --> 06:45.972
ANOTHER HIT TEAM WAS HEADED FOR
SAAD IN CANADA.

06:46.038 --> 06:47.673
>> Saad Aljabri: AND THE WARNING
I RECEIVED, "DON'T BE IN A

DON'T GO TO THE CONSULATE.

06:51.210 --> 06:51.677
DON'T GO TO THE EMBASSY."

06:51.744 --> 06:54.213
I SAID, WHY?

06:54.280 --> 06:58.618
SAID, THEY DISMEMBERED THE GUY,
THEY KILL HIM.

06:58.684 --> 06:59.452
YOU ARE ON THE TOP OF THE LIST.

06:59.519 --> 07:03.523
>> Pelley: SAAD SAYS A
SIX-PERSON TEAM LANDED AT
THE

07:03.589 --> 07:06.826
OTTAWA AIRPORT IN
MID-OCTOBER
2018.

07:06.893 --> 07:11.497
HE SAYS, MEMBERS OF THE TEAM
LIED TO CUSTOMS ABOUT
KNOWING

07:11.564 --> 07:13.332
ONE ANOTHER, AND THEY CARRIED
SUSPICIOUS EQUIPMENT FOR D.N.A.

07:13.399 --> 07:15.501
ANALYSIS.

07:15.568 --> 07:18.805
THE TEAM WAS DEPORTED.

07:18.871 --> 07:23.509
CANADA SEEMS TO CONFIRM AT LEAST
PART OF THIS STORY, SAYING, "WE

07:23.576 --> 07:27.513
ARE AWARE OF INCIDENTS IN WHICH
FOREIGN ACTORS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO

07:27.580 --> 07:30.817
THREATEN THOSE LIVING IN CANADA.

07:30.883 --> 07:31.517
IT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE."

07:31.584 --> 07:35.087
IS THAT THE WAY INTELLIGENCE
ORGANIZATIONS WORK IN THIS

07:35.154 --> 07:35.521
WORLD?

07:35.588 --> 07:39.525
>> Morell: IT'S NOT A NORM
IN
THIS WORLD.

07:39.592 --> 07:43.229
IT'S A NORM FOR COUNTRIES LIKE
RUSSIA AND NORTH KOREA; IT'S NOT

07:43.296 --> 07:47.500
A NORM FOR ALMOST ANY OTHER
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

07:47.567 --> 07:51.003
>> Pelley: DO YOU THINK MOHAMMED
BIN SALMAN FEARS YOU?

07:51.070 --> 07:54.807
>> Saad Aljabri: HE FEARS MY
INFORMATION.

07:54.874 --> 07:59.512
>> Pelley: SAAD TOLD US HIS
INFORMATION INCLUDES A 2014

07:59.579 --> 08:03.182
MEETING BETWEEN PRINCE MOHAMMED,
ON THE LEFT, AND THE THEN-HEAD

08:03.249 --> 08:06.085
OF INTELLIGENCE, MOHAMMED
BIN
NAYEF.

08:06.152 --> 08:11.457
IT WAS THREE YEARS BEFORE
THE
COUP.

08:11.524 --> 08:15.595
SAAD CLAIMS THE YOUNG PRINCE
BOASTED TO NAYEF THAT HE
COULD

08:15.661 --> 08:18.865
KILL THE SITTING KING, ABDULLAH,
TO CLEAR THE THRONE FOR HIS OWN

08:18.931 --> 08:21.701
FATHER.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.569
>> Saad Aljabri: AND HE TOLD
HIM, I WANT TO ASSASSINATE KING

08:23.636 --> 08:24.871
ABDULLAH.

08:24.937 --> 08:27.573
I GET A POISON RING FROM RUSSIA.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.877
IT'S ENOUGH FOR ME JUST TO SHAKE
HAND WITH HIM, AND HE WILL BE

08:30.943 --> 08:31.510
DONE.

08:31.577 --> 08:35.114
>> Pelley: A POISON RING
FROM
RUSSIA?

08:35.181 --> 08:36.883
>> Saad Aljabri: THAT WHAT
HE
SAY.

08:36.949 --> 08:39.185
WHETHER HE'S JUST BRAGGING, OR?

08:39.252 --> 08:42.889
BUT HE SAID THAT, AND WE TOOK IT
SERIOUSLY.

08:42.955 --> 08:45.791
>> Pelley: BY "WE," SAAD
MEANS
SAUDI INTELLIGENCE TOOK IT

08:45.858 --> 08:47.593
SERIOUSLY.

08:47.660 --> 08:51.597
THE ALLEGED THREAT, HE SAYS, WAS
HANDLED WITHIN THE ROYAL FAMILY.

08:51.664 --> 08:55.368
SAAD TOLD US HE WATCHED THE
MEETING ON A VIDEO
RECORDING.

08:55.434 --> 08:57.970
DOES THIS VIDEO RECORDING STILL
EXIST?

08:58.037 --> 08:59.572
>> Saad Aljabri: YES.

08:59.639 --> 09:00.706
I KNOW WHERE IT IS NOW.

09:00.773 --> 09:03.643
I KNOW THERE ARE TWO COPIES
OF
THAT.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.946
I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

09:07.013 --> 09:11.651
>> Pelley: PRINCE MOHAMMED
IS
36, AND WIELDS UNLIMITED
POWER

09:11.717 --> 09:15.655
ON BEHALF OF HIS AILING
85-YEAR-OLD FATHER, KING SALMAN.

09:15.721 --> 09:19.625
THE PRINCE IS ADMIRED BY
SOME
FOR ALLOWING WOMEN TO DRIVE,

09:19.692 --> 09:24.163
PERMITTING MOVIE THEATERS, AND
DISBANDING THE RELIGIOUS POLICE

09:24.230 --> 09:27.633
WHO ONCE ASSAULTED COUPLES
FOR
HOLDING HANDS.

09:27.700 --> 09:31.037
>> Morell: THERE'S TWO GROUPS OF
PEOPLE IN SAUDI ARABIA.

09:31.103 --> 09:36.976
THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE VERY
HAPPY WITH MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN.

09:37.043 --> 09:42.949
THE 70% OF THE POPULATION
THAT
IS UNDER 30.

09:43.015 --> 09:46.786
HE IS NOT POPULAR WITH THE
OLD
GUARD, WITH THE ROYAL
FAMILY,

09:46.852 --> 09:47.653
BECAUSE HE CHANGED THE
SYSTEM.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.690
>> Pelley: BUT MUCH OF THAT
CHANGE HAS BEEN RECKLESS.

09:50.756 --> 09:55.628
HIS WAR IN YEMEN HAS KILLED
THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS IN
WHAT

09:55.695 --> 09:59.632
THE U.N. SAYS MAY BE WAR CRIMES.

09:59.699 --> 10:02.401
HE INVITED LEBANON'S LEADER
TO
VISIT SAUDI ARABIA, TOOK HIM

10:02.468 --> 10:06.205
HOSTAGE, AND FORCED HIM TO
RESIGN.

10:06.272 --> 10:10.109
HE DETAINED HUNDREDS OF
POTENTIAL RIVALS UNTIL THEY

10:10.176 --> 10:12.979
SIGNED OVER THEIR WEALTH, JAILED
WOMEN CALLING FOR HUMAN RIGHTS,

10:13.045 --> 10:15.648
AND MURDERED JAMAL
KHASHOGGI.

10:15.715 --> 10:19.652
>> Saad Aljabri: I EXPECT TO BE
KILLED ONE DAY, BECAUSE THIS GUY

10:19.719 --> 10:23.689
WILL NOT REST OFF UNTIL HE
SEE
ME DEAD.

10:23.756 --> 10:27.660
>> Pelley: BUT WHAT DOES AMERICA
OWE SAAD ALJABRI?

10:27.727 --> 10:31.630
WE ASKED FORMER C.I.A.
ACTING
DIRECTOR AND CBS NEWS

10:31.697 --> 10:35.634
CONSULTANT, MICHAEL MORELL, WHO
WORKED CLOSELY WITH SAAD FROM

10:35.701 --> 10:39.638
2010 TO 2013.

10:39.705 --> 10:47.179
IS IT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT SAAD
MAY HAVE SAVED AMERICAN LIVES?

10:47.246 --> 10:48.981
>> Morell: HE ABSOLUTELY--
DR. SAAD ABSOLUTELY SAVED

10:49.048 --> 10:50.149
AMERICAN LIVES.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.650
HE SAVED SAUDI LIVES, MANY
OF
THEM, AND HE SAVED AMERICAN

10:51.717 --> 10:53.419
LIVES.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.954
>> Pelley: CAN YOU NAME ANY
OF
THOSE CASES?

10:55.021 --> 10:58.858
>> Morell: THE ONE I CAN
TALK
ABOUT IS THE SO-CALLED
PRINTER

10:58.924 --> 10:59.592
CARTRIDGE PLOT.

10:59.658 --> 11:03.729
>> Pelley: IN 2010, AL-QAEDA HID
BOMBS IN TWO DESKTOP PRINTERS.

11:03.796 --> 11:10.036
THEY WERE IN THE AIR, AS CARGO,
HEADED TO THE U.S. ON TWO

11:10.102 --> 11:13.039
PLANES, PERHAPS INTENDED TO
EXPLODE OVER AMERICAN
CITIES.

11:13.105 --> 11:17.610
BUT THANKS TO INTELLIGENCE
RELAYED BY SAAD ALJABRI, THE

11:17.676 --> 11:21.747
BOMBS WERE INTERCEPTED
DURING
LAYOVERS.

11:21.814 --> 11:23.816
ARE THERE ANY OTHER EXAMPLES OF
TIMES THAT SAAD HAD SAVED

11:23.883 --> 11:25.017
AMERICAN LIVES?

11:25.084 --> 11:27.219
>> Morell: THERE ARE.

11:27.286 --> 11:27.753
>> Pelley: WHAT ARE THEY?

11:27.820 --> 11:30.756
>> Morell: I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT
THEM, BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL

11:30.823 --> 11:31.057
CLASSIFIED.

11:31.123 --> 11:33.659
>> Pelley: ARE THERE
SEVERAL?

11:33.726 --> 11:35.728
>> Morell: THERE ARE MANY.

11:35.795 --> 11:39.732
MANY.

11:39.799 --> 11:43.035
>> Pelley: WHILE WORKING IN THAT
CLASSIFIED WORLD, SAAD ALJABRI

11:43.102 --> 11:45.771
BECAME ENORMOUSLY WEALTHY.

11:45.838 --> 11:49.041
PRINCE MOHAMMED TYPICALLY
ACCUSES POTENTIAL RIVALS OF

11:49.108 --> 11:55.047
CORRUPTION, AND SAUDI
ENTITIES
ARE SUING SAAD IN THE U.S.
AND

11:55.114 --> 11:59.318
CANADA, CLAIMING HE STOLE AS
MUCH AS $500 MILLION FROM
THE

11:59.385 --> 11:59.852
COUNTER-TERRORISM BUDGET.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.087
DID YOU STEAL THE MONEY?

12:01.153 --> 12:03.789
>> Saad Aljabri: NO.

12:03.856 --> 12:07.093
>> Pelley: IF YOU DIDN'T
STEAL
THE MONEY, HOW DID YOU GET
SO

12:07.159 --> 12:07.793
RICH?

12:07.860 --> 12:15.768
>> Saad Aljabri: YOU KNOW, I
HAVE SERVED A ROYAL MONARCHY IN

12:15.835 --> 12:19.205
A CLOSE PROXIMITY FOR TWO
DECADES.

12:19.271 --> 12:23.075
THREE KINGS, FOUR CROWN PRINCE.

12:23.142 --> 12:23.776
THEY'VE BEEN NICE TO ME.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.145
THEY'VE BEEN VERY GENEROUS.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.814
IT'S A TRADITION IN SAUDI ARABIA
ROYAL FAMILY.

12:28.881 --> 12:35.354
THEY TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE AROUND
THEM.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.056
>> Morell: I DON'T KNOW IF
DR. SAAD WAS CORRUPT IN ANY WAY.

12:37.123 --> 12:41.627
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF
HE
WASN'T, BECAUSE HE'S SUCH AN

12:41.694 --> 12:43.095
HONORABLE MAN.

12:43.162 --> 12:46.932
BUT I ALSO WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF HE WAS, BECAUSE EVERYBODY, TO

12:46.999 --> 12:49.101
SOME EXTENT, HAD THEIR HAND
IN
THE KITTY.

12:49.168 --> 12:54.907
AND KING ABDULLAH ALLOWED
IT,
PERMITTED IT.

12:54.974 --> 12:59.378
>> Pelley: BUT IN THE SAUDI
LAWSUIT AGAINST SAAD, THE

12:59.445 --> 13:03.482
CANADIAN JUDGE HAS SAID THERE IS
"OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE OF

13:03.549 --> 13:06.952
FRAUD," AND SO SHE HAS
FROZEN
HIS ASSETS AS THE CASE MOVES

13:07.019 --> 13:07.186
FORWARD.

13:07.253 --> 13:13.159
THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT DECLINED AN
INTERVIEW, BUT IN A STATEMENT,

13:13.225 --> 13:16.395
IT SAID, "SAAD ALJABRI IS A
DISCREDITED FORMER
GOVERNMENT

13:16.462 --> 13:19.165
OFFICIAL WITH A LONG HISTORY OF
FABRICATING AND CREATING

13:19.231 --> 13:23.836
DISTRACTIONS TO HIDE THE
FINANCIAL CRIMES HE
COMMITTED.

13:23.903 --> 13:27.840
HE IMPLIES THAT STEALING WAS
ACCEPTABLE AT THE TIME.

13:27.907 --> 13:33.812
BUT IT WASN'T ACCEPTABLE NOR
LEGAL THEN, AND IT ISN'T
NOW."

13:33.879 --> 13:37.149
SAAD SAYS HE'S THINKING ONLY OF
HIS IMPRISONED CHILDREN.

13:37.216 --> 13:39.852
>> Saad Aljabri: I HAVE TO SPEAK
OUT.

13:39.919 --> 13:43.522
I AM APPEALING TO THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE AND TO THE AMERICAN

13:43.589 --> 13:47.860
ADMINISTRATION TO HELP ME TO
RELEASE THOSE CHILDREN AND
TO

13:47.927 --> 13:50.663
RESTORE THEIR LIFE.

13:50.729 --> 13:54.433
>> Pelley: SAAD ALJABRI TOLD US
HE'S RECORDED A "DEATH VIDEO"

13:54.500 --> 13:55.868
THAT REVEALS MORE SECRETS OF THE
ROYAL FAMILY, AND SOME OF THE

13:55.935 --> 13:59.838
UNITED STATES.

13:59.905 --> 14:03.909
HE GAVE US A SHORT, SILENT CLIP
OF THE VIDEO WHICH, HE TOLD US,

14:03.976 --> 14:07.246
"COULD BE RELEASED" IF HE IS
KILLED.

14:07.313 --> 14:11.917
IT INCLUDES A MESSAGE TO
OMAR
AND SARAH, HIS IMPRISONED

14:11.984 --> 14:13.252
CHILDREN.

14:13.319 --> 14:18.958
>> Saad Aljabri: I TOLD
THEM,
I'M SORRY.

14:19.024 --> 14:19.325
I TRIED MY BEST.

14:19.391 --> 14:27.900
>> Pelley: DOES THE UNITED
STATES, AS A COUNTRY, OWE

14:27.967 --> 14:30.135
ANYTHING TO SAAD?

14:30.202 --> 14:31.637
>> Morell: DO I FEEL SOME
OBLIGATION TO DR. SAAD?

14:31.704 --> 14:35.574
YES.

14:35.641 --> 14:39.411
DOES THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA?

14:39.478 --> 14:39.912
THE PEOPLE AT C.I.A. DO.

14:39.979 --> 14:42.014
THE PEOPLE AT C.I.A. DO.

14:42.081 --> 14:43.949
YOUKNOW, WHETHER THE COUNTRY
DOES OR NOT, I DON'T KNOW.

14:44.016 --> 14:48.153
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A HARD
QUESTION.

14:48.220 --> 14:52.091
>> Pelley: IT'S BEEN HARD
FOR
PRESIDENTS TO STAND UP TO

14:52.157 --> 14:55.227
MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN.

14:55.294 --> 14:58.797
NEITHER THE TRUMP NOR BIDEN
ADMINISTRATIONS PUBLICLY

14:58.864 --> 14:59.898
SANCTIONED HIM AFTER KHASHOGGI.

14:59.965 --> 15:03.969
SAUDI OIL ISN'T AS IMPORTANT AS
IT ONCE WAS, BUT COUNTERING IRAN

15:04.036 --> 15:11.043
<i>IS, </i>WHICH HAS LED TO A CERTAIN
TOLERANCE OF A MENACING PRINCE.

15:11.110 --> 15:15.981
(<i> TICKING </i>)
>><i> DR. SAAD ALJABRI ON THE</i>
<i>HIT</i>

15:16.048 --> 15:21.787
<i>SQUAD HE SAYS MOHAMMAD BIN</i>
<i>SALMAN SENT TO SILENCE DISSENT.</i>

15:21.854 --> 15:26.759
<i>AT 60minutesovertime.com.</i>

15:31.530 --> 15:34.266
>> Bill Whitaker: THIS PAST
WEEK, CALIFORNIA DECLARED A

15:34.333 --> 15:36.635
STATEWIDE DROUGHT EMERGENCY.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.170
IT FOLLOWS THE FIRST-EVER
FEDERAL SHORTAGE DECLARATION ON

15:38.237 --> 15:42.241
THE COLORADO RIVER,
TRIGGERING
CUTS TO WATER SUPPLIES IN
THE

15:42.308 --> 15:45.444
SOUTHWEST.

15:45.511 --> 15:49.081
THE COLORADO IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF
THE REGION.

15:49.148 --> 15:52.284
IT WATERS SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S
FASTEST-GROWING CITIES,

15:52.351 --> 15:54.486
NOURISHES SOME OF OUR MOST
FERTILE FIELDS, AND POWERS

15:54.553 --> 15:58.123
$1.4 TRILLION IN ANNUAL ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY.

15:58.190 --> 16:01.527
THE RIVER RUNS MORE THAN
1,400
MILES, FROM HEADWATERS IN

16:01.593 --> 16:06.198
THE ROCKIES TO ITS DELTA IN
NORTHERN MEXICO, WHERE IT
ENDS

16:06.265 --> 16:07.499
IN A TRICKLE.

16:07.566 --> 16:13.505
SEVEN STATES AND 30 NATIVE
AMERICAN TRIBES LIE IN THE

16:13.572 --> 16:14.206
COLORADO RIVER BASIN.

16:14.273 --> 16:19.511
LATELY, THE RIVER HAS BEEN
RUNNING DRY DUE TO THE

16:19.578 --> 16:24.983
HISTORICALLY SEVERE DROUGHT.

16:25.050 --> 16:29.321
THE MAJESTIC, MEANDERING
COLORADO RIVER, THAT CUT THROUGH

16:29.388 --> 16:31.523
THESE RED CLIFFS, CARVING
THE
GRAND CANYON, IS A WONDER OF

16:31.590 --> 16:34.193
NATURE AND HUMAN INGENUITY.

16:34.259 --> 16:38.230
THE GLEN CANYON DAM CREATED
LAKE POWELL AND, 300 MILES

16:38.297 --> 16:44.703
DOWN-RIVER, LAKE MEAD SITS
BEHIND THE HOOVER DAM.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.538
THESE RESERVOIRS ARE NOW
BEING
SUCKED DRY BY 40 MILLION

16:46.605 --> 16:49.508
DIFFERENT STRAWS-- THAT'S
THE
NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN BOOMING

16:49.575 --> 16:53.846
WESTERN STATES WHO DEPEND ON THE
COLORADO TO QUENCH THEIR THIRST,

16:53.912 --> 16:58.183
POWER THEIR HOMES, WATER
LAWNS
AND SPLASH IN THE SUN.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.587
ITS WATERS IRRIGATE FARMS
THAT
PRODUCE 90% OF THE COUNTRY'S

17:01.653 --> 17:05.391
WINTER GREENS.

17:05.457 --> 17:07.693
TO ALL THESE DEMANDS, ADD THE
STRESS OF A 22-YEAR DROUGHT, AS

17:07.760 --> 17:13.265
DRY AS ANY PERIOD IN 1,200
YEARS, AND YOU HAVE A RIVER
IN

17:13.332 --> 17:13.565
CRISIS.

17:13.632 --> 17:17.069
THESE WHITE BATHTUB RINGS; IS--
IS THIS WHERE THE WATER USED TO

17:17.136 --> 17:18.303
BE?

17:18.370 --> 17:19.571
>> Brad Udall: ABSOLUTELY.

17:19.638 --> 17:22.408
>> Whitaker: BRAD UDALL, A
CLIMATE SCIENTIST AT
COLORADO

17:22.474 --> 17:26.245
STATE UNIVERSITY, WENT OUT
ON
LAKE POWELL WITH US.

17:26.311 --> 17:30.149
SO ALL OF THIS WOULD HAVE
BEEN
UNDERWATER?

17:30.215 --> 17:30.516
>> Udall: YEAH.

17:30.582 --> 17:34.253
>> Whitaker: SO WHAT DOES THIS
TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING

17:34.319 --> 17:36.622
ON THE COLORADO RIVER?

17:36.688 --> 17:38.290
>> Udall: WELL, IT'S A SIGNAL OF
THE LONG-TERM PROBLEM WE'VE BEEN

17:38.357 --> 17:42.261
SEEING SINCE THE YEAR 2000,
WHICH IS, CLIMATE CHANGE IS

17:42.327 --> 17:46.265
REDUCING THE FLOWS OF THE
COLORADO SIGNIFICANTLY.

17:46.331 --> 17:49.568
>> Whitaker: LAKE POWELL AND
LAKE MEAD, THE TWO BIGGEST

17:49.635 --> 17:54.273
RESERVOIRS IN THE COUNTRY, WERE
NEARLY FULL IN 2000.

17:54.339 --> 17:58.243
TODAY, THEY ARE AT JUST
ABOUT
30% CAPACITY.

17:58.310 --> 18:01.914
>> Udall: THE LAKE'S NOW 155
FEET BELOW FULL.

18:01.980 --> 18:05.050
IT'S DROPPED SOMETHING LIKE
50
FEET THIS YEAR.

18:05.117 --> 18:06.318
>> Whitaker: AND IT'S STILL
DROPPING?

18:06.385 --> 18:07.653
>> Udall: YES.

18:07.719 --> 18:10.322
AND THAT'S WHEN POWER GENERATION
ACTUALLY BECOMES TO COME INTO

18:10.389 --> 18:11.857
QUESTION.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.425
>> Whitaker: SO IT DROPS SO LOW
THAT IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

18:13.492 --> 18:14.326
GENERATE--
>> Udall: IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

18:14.393 --> 18:15.594
GENERATE POWER.

18:15.661 --> 18:17.629
>> Whitaker: --HYDROELECTRIC
POWER?

18:17.696 --> 18:18.330
>> Udall: YEAH.

18:18.397 --> 18:22.334
>> Whitaker: BRAD UDALL HAS
STRONG CONNECTIONS TO THE RIVER.

18:22.401 --> 18:25.671
AS SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR,
HIS UNCLE, STEWART UDALL, OPENED

18:25.737 --> 18:29.074
THE GLEN CANYON DAM.

18:29.141 --> 18:31.677
HIS FATHER, CONGRESSMAN MO
UDALL, FOUGHT TO CHANNEL
RIVER

18:31.743 --> 18:34.313
WATER TO ARIZONA.

18:34.379 --> 18:37.683
AS A YOUNG MAN, BRAD WAS A
COLORADO RIVER GUIDE.

18:37.749 --> 18:42.120
TODAY, HE ANALYZES THE IMPACT OF
CLIMATE CHANGE ON WATER

18:42.187 --> 18:42.387
RESOURCES.

18:42.454 --> 18:46.325
IS THE WEST ON A COLLISION
COURSE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE?

18:46.391 --> 18:49.661
>> Udall: IN SOME WAYS, YES, BUT
WE HAVE FULLY UTILIZED THIS

18:49.728 --> 18:50.329
SYSTEM.

18:50.395 --> 18:54.333
WE'VE OVER-ALLOCATED IT, AND WE
NOW NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO

18:54.399 --> 18:57.402
TURN SOME OF THIS BACK.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.072
BECAUSE THE ONLY LEVER WE
CONTROL RIGHT NOW IN THE
RIVER

19:00.138 --> 19:01.006
IS THE DEMAND LEVER.

19:01.073 --> 19:05.377
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE
SUPPLY.

19:05.444 --> 19:06.411
SO WE HAVE TO DIAL BACK DEMAND.

19:06.478 --> 19:10.382
>> Whitaker: 70% OF COLORADO
RIVER WATER GOES TO AGRICULTURE.

19:10.449 --> 19:16.655
WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
DECLARED THE WATER SHORTAGE, IT

19:16.722 --> 19:17.322
TRIGGERED MANDATORY
CUTBACKS.

19:17.389 --> 19:19.725
PINAL COUNTY, ARIZONA GOT
HIT
HARD.

19:19.791 --> 19:24.263
>> Waylon Wuertz: PINAL COUNTY
ALONE, WE'RE GOING TO BE LOSING

19:24.329 --> 19:26.398
300,000 ACRE FEET OF SURFACE
WATER.

19:26.465 --> 19:31.737
THAT'S WATER THAT WOULD BE
DELIVERED FROM LAKE POWELL,

19:31.803 --> 19:34.406
LAKE MEAD.

19:34.473 --> 19:37.576
AS PART OF THE COLORADO
RIVER.

19:37.643 --> 19:42.381
300,000 ACRE FEET IS 98 BILLION
GALLONS OF WATER.

19:42.447 --> 19:46.118
>> Whitaker: WAYLON WUERTZ FARMS
500 ACRES IN PINAL COUNTY, SOUTH

19:46.184 --> 19:46.418
OF PHOENIX.

19:46.485 --> 19:49.721
HIS FAMILY HAS TILLED SOIL HERE
FOR FOUR GENERATIONS.

19:49.788 --> 19:54.393
IT'S SOME OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE
LAND IN THE STATE.

19:54.459 --> 20:00.399
CROPS FROM PINAL COUNTY ARE
SHIPPED ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY.

20:00.465 --> 20:06.405
WUERTZ GROWS GOURDS, COTTON, AND
ALFALFA-- PROFITABLE BUT THIRSTY

20:06.471 --> 20:10.409
CROPS-- AND HIS ALLOTMENT OF
COLORADO RIVER WATER IS
BEING

20:10.475 --> 20:12.711
CUT BY 70%.

20:12.778 --> 20:13.745
THIS IS COLORADO RIVER
WATER?

20:13.812 --> 20:17.249
>> Wuertz: YEAH, KIND OF
THE--
THE LIFELINE OF OUR
IRRIGATED

20:17.316 --> 20:18.016
A.G. HERE.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.751
>> Whitaker: THIS COMES STRAIGHT
IN FROM LAKE MEAD?

20:19.818 --> 20:21.219
>> Wuertz: CORRECT.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.956
THIS IS-- THROUGH HUNDREDS
OF
MILES OF CANAL SYSTEM.

20:24.022 --> 20:29.861
IT'S MADE ITS WAY DOWN HERE
TO
CENTRAL ARIZONA.

20:29.928 --> 20:31.730
>> Whitaker: AND WHAT PERCENTAGE
OF YOUR WATER IS SUPPLIED BY

20:31.797 --> 20:34.399
THIS CANAL?

20:34.466 --> 20:37.736
>> Wuertz: IT'S BEEN CLOSE TO
50% OF THE WATER THAT WE'VE USED

20:37.803 --> 20:38.437
TO-- TO FARM HERE.

20:38.503 --> 20:42.374
AND, THIS NEXT YEAR, IT'S
PROBABLY GOING TO DROP DOWN
TO

20:42.441 --> 20:45.243
ABOUT 20% OF THE WATER THAT
WE
USE.

20:45.310 --> 20:46.578
>> Whitaker: THAT'S ONE-SEVENTH
OF WHAT HE WAS GETTING A DECADE

20:46.645 --> 20:49.748
AGO.

20:49.815 --> 20:54.386
TO USE LESS WATER AND MAKE ENDS
MEET, WUERTZ SOLD MORE THAN 300

20:54.453 --> 20:58.390
ACRES TO A SOLAR FARM.

20:58.457 --> 21:02.461
HE DIPPED INTO RETIREMENT FUNDS
TO REPAIR AND RESTART OLD WELLS.

21:02.527 --> 21:06.665
HE LASER-LEVELED HIS FIELDS TO
MAKE IRRIGATION MORE EFFICIENT.

21:06.732 --> 21:09.801
BUT IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH, IN THE
MIDDLE OF THIS DROUGHT.

21:09.868 --> 21:10.469
>> Wuertz: NO, IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

21:10.535 --> 21:14.473
>> Whitaker: SO NEXT YEAR, HE
TOLD US, HE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE 150

21:14.539 --> 21:17.643
ACRES UNCULTIVATED.

21:17.709 --> 21:19.811
>> Wuertz: WHAT YOU SEE GREEN
HERE IS EVENTUALLY GOING TO DIE.

21:19.878 --> 21:23.415
I HOPE WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH
WATER
TO PLANT IT IN THE FUTURE.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.317
BUT MORE THAN LIKELY, IT'S GOING
TO STAY BROWN FOR QUITE SOME

21:25.384 --> 21:25.817
TIME.

21:25.884 --> 21:29.054
>> Amelia Flores: ALL THE WATER-
USERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE

21:29.121 --> 21:31.790
UP SOMETHING TO KEEP THAT WATER
IN THE LAKE.

21:31.857 --> 21:36.795
>> Whitaker: AMELIA FLORES IS
CHAIRWOMAN OF THE COLORADO RIVER

21:36.862 --> 21:41.667
INDIAN TRIBES, A RESERVATION OF
FOUR TRIBES A FEW HOURS WEST OF

21:41.733 --> 21:46.471
PHOENIX, WITH THE OLDEST AND
LARGEST WATER RIGHTS IN ARIZONA.

21:46.538 --> 21:49.808
AFTER BEING MOVED TO
RESERVATIONS, SOUTHWEST
TRIBES

21:49.875 --> 21:54.246
GOT RIGHTS TO ABOUT A QUARTER OF
THE RIVER'S FLOW, BUT GOVERNMENT

21:54.312 --> 21:55.814
RED TAPE AND LACK OF
INFRASTRUCTURE HAVE
PREVENTED

21:55.881 --> 21:58.517
THEM FROM USING THEIR FULL
ALLOTMENT.

21:58.583 --> 22:04.756
FLORES TOLD US, UNTIL THIS
DROUGHT, TRIBES WERE NEVER

22:04.823 --> 22:06.525
INCLUDED IN WATER NEGOTIATIONS.

22:06.591 --> 22:10.529
WHY HAD YOU NOT HAD A SEAT
AT
THE TABLE BEFORE THIS?

22:10.595 --> 22:13.865
>> Flores: BECAUSE THE
TRIBES
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OVERLOOKED
IN

22:13.932 --> 22:18.537
THE POLICYMAKING, AND-- AND IN--
IN THE LAW OF THE RIVER.

22:18.603 --> 22:19.871
BUT THAT DAY HAS COME TO AN END.

22:19.938 --> 22:24.409
>> Whitaker: WHEN WESTERN STATES
FIRST DIVVIED UP THE COLORADO

22:24.476 --> 22:29.748
RIVER IN 1922, AND LATER, WHEN
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUILT THE

22:29.815 --> 22:31.883
HOOVER AND GLEN CANYON DAMS, THE
FUTURE SEEMED BOUNDLESS AND

22:31.950 --> 22:34.519
MANAGEABLE.

22:34.586 --> 22:37.355
THROUGH NEGOTIATION AND
COURT
BATTLES, STATES WORKED OUT

22:37.422 --> 22:41.526
AGREEMENTS-- THE LAW OF THE
RIVER-- TO SPLIT THE WATER

22:41.593 --> 22:45.797
EQUALLY BETWEEN UPPER AND LOWER
BASIN STATES.

22:45.864 --> 22:49.868
THE LOWER STATES USE JUST ABOUT
ALL THEIR ALLOTMENT, AND IT'S

22:49.935 --> 22:50.535
FED THEIR TREMENDOUS GROWTH.

22:50.602 --> 22:54.539
THE UPPER STATES HAVE NEVER USED
THEIR FULL SHARE.

22:54.606 --> 22:58.510
NOW, THEY ARE BOOMING, AND SAY
THEY NEED THE WATER THEY'VE BEEN

22:58.577 --> 23:00.612
PROMISED.

23:00.679 --> 23:02.581
I CAN SEE THE BATHTUB RINGS
AROUND HERE TOO.

23:02.647 --> 23:05.517
>> Zach Renstrom: WE'RE
TRYING
TO KEEP EVERY DROP OF WATER
WE

23:05.584 --> 23:07.953
CAN INTO THIS RESERVOIR FOR NEXT
YEAR'S DRINKING WATER.

23:08.019 --> 23:10.589
>> Whitaker: ZACH RENSTROM
MANAGES THE WATER SYSTEM FOR

23:10.655 --> 23:13.925
WASHINGTON COUNTY IN
SOUTHWEST
UTAH.

23:13.992 --> 23:18.230
ST. GEORGE, THE COUNTY SEAT, IS
ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING METRO

23:18.296 --> 23:18.630
AREAS IN THE U.S.

23:18.697 --> 23:25.437
ITS POPULATION GREW 29% THIS
PAST DECADE.

23:25.504 --> 23:29.875
THE STATE OF UTAH GETS ABOUT
A
QUARTER OF ITS WATER FROM
THE

23:29.941 --> 23:33.645
COLORADO, BUT MOST OF WASHINGTON
COUNTY HAS ONLY ONE SOURCE, THE

23:33.712 --> 23:36.948
VIRGIN RIVER, WHICH FILLS
THIS
RESERVOIR.

23:37.015 --> 23:38.650
>> Renstrom: SO RIGHT NOW, WE'RE
IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING

23:38.717 --> 23:42.287
REALLY STRICT CONSERVATION
MEASURES.

23:42.354 --> 23:43.922
AND IF THE CITIES DON'T
ADOPT
THOSE STANDARDS, THEN WE'LL
BE

23:43.989 --> 23:44.723
OUT OF WATER VERY QUICKLY.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.591
>> Whitaker: WHAT IS "VERY
QUICKLY?"

23:46.658 --> 23:49.928
>> Renstrom: WITHIN THE NEXT
FIVE TO TEN YEARS.

23:49.995 --> 23:54.599
>> Whitaker: SO, IN THE MIDST OF
THIS DROUGHT, UTAH IS PROPOSING

23:54.666 --> 23:58.603
TO BUILD A $1 TO $2 BILLION
PIPELINE, ABLE TO BRING 27

23:58.670 --> 24:02.007
BILLION GALLONS OF WATER A YEAR
FROM DWINDLING LAKE POWELL.

24:02.073 --> 24:06.678
UTAH SAYS IT'S ENTITLED TO
THE
WATER BY LAW.

24:06.745 --> 24:10.649
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
SIPHONING
OFF WATER FROM A LAKE THAT'S

24:10.715 --> 24:14.653
ALREADY AT A CRITICALLY LOW
LEVEL, TO HELP A CITY GROW
IN

24:14.719 --> 24:18.623
THE DESERT.

24:18.690 --> 24:22.160
>> Renstrom: EVERY STATE ON THE
COLORADO RIVER WAS ALLOTTED SO

24:22.227 --> 24:22.794
MUCH WATER, AND A WATER BUDGET.

24:22.861 --> 24:25.997
AND SO, WITH THEIR WATER BUDGET,
THE STATE OF UTAH HAS DECIDED

24:26.064 --> 24:28.733
THAT IT WANTS TO USE A PORTION
OF ITS WATER HERE IN ST. GEORGE,

24:28.800 --> 24:29.668
UTAH.

24:29.734 --> 24:32.037
>> Whitaker: BUT IT WAS A BUDGET
THAT WAS SET WHEN WATER WAS

24:32.103 --> 24:33.171
PLENTIFUL.

24:33.238 --> 24:34.206
IT ISN'T ANYMORE.

24:34.272 --> 24:34.706
WHAT IS UTAH HOPING FOR?

24:34.773 --> 24:38.009
>> Renstrom: UTAH WANTS THE
RIGHT TO DO WHAT EVERY OTHER

24:38.076 --> 24:38.710
BASIN STATE HAS DONE.

24:38.777 --> 24:42.180
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE
HAVE WATER FOR OUR FUTURE, FOR A

24:42.247 --> 24:44.015
HOTTER, DRYER SCENARIO
THAT'S
COMING UP.

24:44.082 --> 24:50.021
>> J.B. Hamby: BUILDING A MULTI-
BILLION DOLLAR PIPELINE TO PUMP

24:50.088 --> 24:52.224
OUT MORE WATER FROM AN
ALREADY
RAPIDLY DECLINING RESERVOIR

24:52.290 --> 24:55.994
SIMPLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IN THE
21st CENTURY.

24:56.061 --> 25:02.033
>> Whitaker: J.B. HAMBY IS VICE
PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD THAT RUNS

25:02.100 --> 25:05.003
CALIFORNIA'S IMPERIAL IRRIGATION
DISTRICT, ONE OF THE RICHEST

25:05.070 --> 25:07.239
AGRICULTURAL REGIONS IN THE
COUNTRY, WITH THE SINGLE LARGEST

25:07.305 --> 25:10.475
ALLOCATION OF WATER ON THE
ENTIRE RIVER.

25:10.542 --> 25:13.478
>> Hamby: THERE'S A LOT OF URBAN
GROWTH AND SPRAWL OCCURRING IN

25:13.545 --> 25:14.713
OTHER PARTS OF THE COLORADO
RIVER BASIN THAT'S REALLY
NOT

25:14.779 --> 25:18.049
NECESSARILY SUSTAINABLE.

25:18.116 --> 25:22.721
>> Whitaker: HAMBY SAYS
CALIFORNIA'S IMPERIAL VALLEY

25:22.787 --> 25:26.091
FARMS HAVE CUT WATER USAGE
ALMOST 20% SINCE 2003, BUT

25:26.157 --> 25:30.729
POINTS OUT AS THE POPULATION OF
ST. GEORGE, UTAH GROWS, SO DOES

25:30.795 --> 25:32.097
ITS WATER USE.

25:32.163 --> 25:35.166
>> Hamby: WE NEED TO THINK
AND
RETHINK ABOUT HOW WE GROW,
AND

25:35.233 --> 25:37.469
IF WE GROW AND WHERE WE
GROW.

25:37.535 --> 25:38.770
>> Whitaker: ST. GEORGE WOULD
SAY THAT THEY'RE NOT ASKING FOR

25:38.837 --> 25:42.741
MORE-- THEY'RE ASKING FOR
WHAT
THEY NEED.

25:42.807 --> 25:46.711
>> Hamby: I THINK WHAT WE ALL
NEED TO HAVE IS A REALITY CHECK,

25:46.778 --> 25:50.415
HERE, AND RECOGNIZE THAT WE LIVE
IN AN ERA OF LIMITS RIGHT NOW,

25:50.482 --> 25:52.050
AND THAT'S NOT GOING AWAY
ANYTIME SOON.

25:52.117 --> 25:54.719
IN FACT, IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET
WORSE.

25:54.786 --> 25:58.723
>> Whitaker: A BIG PART OF THE
PROBLEM IS THE LAW OF THE RIVER

25:58.790 --> 26:02.160
ITSELF, A HODGEPODGE OF RULES
AND REGULATIONS PIECED TOGETHER

26:02.227 --> 26:05.463
OVER THE COURSE OF A
CENTURY.

26:05.530 --> 26:09.935
FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER ALL THE
LITIGATION AND NEGOTIATIONS, THE

26:10.001 --> 26:14.172
LAW ENDS UP ALLOCATING MORE
WATER THAN ACTUALLY FLOWS
DOWN

26:14.239 --> 26:14.806
THE COLORADO.

26:14.873 --> 26:20.145
AND THIS: IN TIMES OF SHORTAGE,
CHANNELS THAT PROVIDE MORE THAN

26:20.211 --> 26:25.951
A THIRD OF ARIZONA'S WATER MUST
RUN DRY BEFORE CALIFORNIA IS

26:26.017 --> 26:26.418
REQUIRED TO CUT BACK.

26:26.484 --> 26:32.157
SO-- SO, WAIT A MINUTE-- ARIZONA
IS BEING CALLED ON TO CUT ITS

26:32.223 --> 26:34.793
WATER INTAKE BEFORE
CALIFORNIA
HAS TO GIVE UP EVEN ONE
DROP?

26:34.859 --> 26:38.163
>> Udall: PRETTY AMAZING.

26:38.229 --> 26:38.830
IT CAN'T WORK IN TODAY'S WORLD.

26:38.897 --> 26:43.268
AND IT'S, IN SOME WAYS, A LITTLE
MICROCOSM, RIGHT, OF THIS WHOLE

26:43.335 --> 26:46.638
LAW OF THE RIVER, WITH THESE
SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT
IN

26:46.705 --> 26:47.205
PLACE THAT JUST DON'T WORK.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.140
THEY CAN'T WORK.

26:49.207 --> 26:50.809
AND THAT'S WHY A RETHINK'S
NEEDED.

26:50.875 --> 26:56.147
>> Whitaker: ONE EXAMPLE OF
RETHINKING?

26:56.214 --> 27:00.919
THE COLORADO RIVER INDIAN TRIBES
AGREED TO LEAVE FIELDS

27:00.986 --> 27:02.754
UNCULTIVATED, LEAVING 48 BILLION
GALLONS-- ALMOST THREE FEET OF

27:02.821 --> 27:05.957
WATER-- IN LAKE MEAD.

27:06.024 --> 27:08.226
THE STATE OF ARIZONA AGREED
TO
PAY THEM FOR THEIR LOSSES.

27:08.293 --> 27:14.232
>> Flores: MY PEOPLE WANT TO
HELP DURING THIS DROUGHT.

27:14.299 --> 27:18.870
WE WANT TO SAVE THE RIVER,
BECAUSE FOR CENTURIES, THE RIVER

27:18.937 --> 27:22.841
HAS ALWAYS TAKEN CARE OF US, SO
NOW, WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE

27:22.907 --> 27:23.041
RIVER.

27:23.108 --> 27:26.211
>> Udall: THAT'S WHAT
NEGOTIATIONS ARE ALL ABOUT,

27:26.277 --> 27:26.845
RIGHT?

27:26.911 --> 27:30.081
IT MAY BE THERE ARE WAYS TO
CONSERVE, AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO

27:30.148 --> 27:34.853
GET THE SAME GOODS AND SERVICES
FOR LESS WATER.

27:34.919 --> 27:37.856
LET'S LET A.G. GROW CROPS
THAT
USE LESS WATER.

27:37.922 --> 27:39.057
LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE
CITIES USE WATER AS EFFICIENTLY

27:39.124 --> 27:41.893
AS POSSIBLE.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.229
SO, I MEAN, WE NEED SOME
OPTIMISM HERE, RIGHT?

27:44.295 --> 27:46.598
>> Wuertz: THIS DESERT GROUND...

27:46.664 --> 27:49.200
>> Whitaker: BUT AS WE SAW
AT
THIS MEETING OF PINAL COUNTY

27:49.267 --> 27:50.802
FARMERS, OPTIMISM IS IN
SHORT
SUPPLY.

27:50.869 --> 27:54.939
>> Wuertz: THE FARMER WHO'S
PREPARED THEIR WHOLE LIFE,

27:55.006 --> 27:59.344
WORKED THE LAND, FARMED THE
LAND, IS GETTING THE SHORT
END

27:59.411 --> 28:02.013
OF THE STICK.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.449
>> Whitaker: FARMERS HERE
AND
ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST FEED
THE

28:04.516 --> 28:05.550
COUNTRY.

28:05.617 --> 28:06.985
BUT IT TAKES MORE THAN TWO-
THIRDS OF THE COLORADO RIVER TO

28:07.052 --> 28:10.355
PRODUCE THE BOUNTY.

28:10.422 --> 28:14.292
WITH LAKE LEVELS DROPPING,
ARIZONA FARMERS LIKE WAYLON

28:14.359 --> 28:18.930
WUERTZ FEAR THEIR FERTILE FIELDS
COULD BECOME DESERT AGAIN.

28:18.997 --> 28:22.934
>> Wuertz: YOU'RE GOING TO
SEE
DRASTIC CUTS, A DRASTIC
CHANGE

28:23.001 --> 28:24.602
OF WHAT NEXT YEAR HAS TO BRING.

28:24.669 --> 28:26.371
AND FOR MY PARTICULAR FAMILY
FARM, WE'RE DOING ALL THAT
WE

28:26.438 --> 28:30.942
CAN TO KEEP IT GOING.

28:31.009 --> 28:36.347
BUT I HAVE A FEELING IT'S JUST A
MATTER OF TIME BEFORE NONE OF

28:36.414 --> 28:37.882
THIS EXISTS.

28:37.949 --> 28:40.819
(<i> TICKING </i>)
(<i> TICKING </i>)

28:48.626 --> 28:51.529
>> Jon Wertheim: IT'S ALMOST
LIKE, WHEN NO ONE WAS
LOOKING,

28:51.596 --> 28:52.730
MICHAEL KEATON CREPT ON TO
HOLLYWOOD'S A-LIST, AND THEN

28:52.797 --> 28:55.433
NEVER LEFT.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.734
EXCEPT THAT WE<i> WERE </i>LOOKING.

28:56.801 --> 28:58.436
KEATON'S FILMS HAVE,
COLLECTIVELY, GROSSED
BILLIONS

28:58.503 --> 29:00.738
AT THE BOX OFFICE.

29:00.805 --> 29:04.209
HE'S PLAYED BIRDMAN AND BATMAN,
AND STARRED IN "SPIDER-MAN."

29:04.275 --> 29:07.078
THE IRONY IS THAT KEATON'S REAL
POWER IS PORTRAYING THE

29:07.145 --> 29:08.313
EVERY-MAN.

29:08.379 --> 29:12.317
THE SALESMAN, THE F.B.I.
MAN,
THE PUT-UPON NEWSPAPERMAN.

29:12.383 --> 29:15.720
AN ACTOR ON A CAREER-LONG
CRUSADE AGAINST TYPECASTING,

29:15.787 --> 29:16.821
KEATON IS WILLFULLY
UNPREDICTABLE IN CHOOSING
HIS

29:16.888 --> 29:19.324
ROLES.

29:19.390 --> 29:22.227
BUT, HE IS CONSISTENT IN NAILING
THEM.

29:22.293 --> 29:24.762
AND AT AGE 70, HE'S STILL AT IT.

29:24.829 --> 29:28.233
FIND MICHAEL KEATON A CHARACTER
HE FINDS APPEALING, AND, TO

29:28.299 --> 29:32.804
BORROW A PHRASE, IT'S SHOW TIME.

29:32.871 --> 29:36.608
FORGET ABOUT MEETING AT SOME
PRECIOUS MALIBU BISTRO OR ON
A

29:36.674 --> 29:36.875
MOVIE SET.

29:36.941 --> 29:44.816
MICHAEL KEATON WANTED US TO MEET
HIM IN HIS ELEMENT, SO WE DID,

29:44.883 --> 29:48.219
HERE-- ON HIS 1,000-ACRE SWATCH
OF TROUT STREAMS AND MOUNTAINS

29:48.286 --> 29:48.820
UNDER MONTANA'S BIG SKY.

29:48.887 --> 29:51.789
>> Michael Keaton: WOW, LOOK AT
THAT.

29:51.856 --> 29:52.991
>> Wertheim: IT'S EASY TO BE
HUMBLED BY THE SHEER VASTNESS OF

29:53.057 --> 29:56.261
THE PLACE.

29:56.327 --> 29:58.263
NOT THAT THIS IS A MOVIE STAR IN
NEED OF ANY EGO REDUCTION.

29:58.329 --> 30:00.832
>> Keaton: AS SOON AS I
BOUGHT
THIS PLACE-- SOON AS I
BOUGHT

30:00.899 --> 30:04.202
IT-- AND IT WAS A DREAM OF MINE
FROM THE TIME I WAS A LITTLE

30:04.269 --> 30:07.939
KID-- IT HIT ME.

30:08.006 --> 30:10.208
LIKE, IT WAS CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT
I DON'T REALLY OWN ANYTHING.

30:10.275 --> 30:12.810
YOU DON'T REALLY-- YOU--
WE'RE
RENTERS.

30:12.877 --> 30:13.912
YOU KNOW, I DON'T OWN THIS.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.380
THIS IS JUST-- I JUST
HAPPENED
TO MAKE A TRANSACTION.

30:15.446 --> 30:16.814
>> Wertheim: JUST PASSING
THROUGH.

30:16.881 --> 30:19.284
>> Keaton: PASSING THROUGH.

30:19.350 --> 30:22.220
>> Wertheim: AFTER A SHORT DRIVE
UP A DIRT PATH, WE DISCUSSED

30:22.287 --> 30:24.822
RANGE OF A DIFFERENT SORT.

30:24.889 --> 30:28.226
WE ASKED KEATON ABOUT HIS
STAGGERING VERSATILITY, THE KEY

30:28.293 --> 30:31.129
TO HIS SUCCESS AND HOLLYWOOD
LONGEVITY.

30:31.196 --> 30:32.931
>> Wertheim: GO DOWN YOUR
IMdB
PAGE AND, IN THE BEST
POSSIBLE

30:32.997 --> 30:36.801
WAY, YOU GET WHIPLASH.

30:36.868 --> 30:40.205
I SEE THIS ARCHETYPE,
AMERICAN
MALE, AND IT'S LAWYERS, AND

30:40.271 --> 30:41.940
NEWSPAPER MEN, AND DOCTORS.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.241
>> Keaton: I GUESS THAT'S TRUE.

30:43.308 --> 30:44.676
I GUESS, YEAH.

30:44.742 --> 30:48.012
IF I WENT-- AND I'VE NEVER SEEN
MY IMd-- IMdB?

30:48.079 --> 30:48.713
OR IM-B-D?

30:48.780 --> 30:50.548
(<i> LAUGHS </i>)
WHICH ONE?

30:50.615 --> 30:53.885
I CAN KNOW-- WHICH-- WHICH ONE
COMES FIRST-- BUT I-- BUT, YEAH.

30:53.952 --> 30:55.954
WELL, IF YOU PUT IT LIKE
THAT,
I'D GO, YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.522
BUT IT'S A REPRESENTATION OF ALL
KIND OF, YOU KNOW, WITHIN THAT.

30:57.589 --> 31:00.491
LIKE, BUT-- WHO'S THE PERSON IN
THAT JOB?

31:00.558 --> 31:02.126
YOU KNOW, WHAT'S-- WHAT'S
THE
PERSON IN THAT JOB?

31:02.193 --> 31:03.728
>> Wertheim: RIGHT, RIGHT,
RIGHT, RIGHT.

31:03.795 --> 31:06.297
>> Keaton: PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
RANGE.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.666
THERE'S-- YOU KNOW, IT'S--
FLATTERING.

31:08.733 --> 31:10.268
BUT RANGE DOESN'T REALLY--
RANGE, SCHMANGE, YOU KNOW.

31:10.335 --> 31:12.003
IT, LIKE--
>> Wertheim: REALLY?

31:12.070 --> 31:13.404
>> Keaton: YEAH, WELL, RANGE--
>> Wertheim: I WOULD THINK YOU'D

31:13.471 --> 31:14.706
TAKE PRIDE IN THAT.

31:14.772 --> 31:15.807
>> Keaton: I DO.

31:15.873 --> 31:18.109
BUT I DON'T THINK OF IT IN TERMS
OF, "WELL, YOU PLAYED<i> THAT.</i>

31:18.176 --> 31:18.876
THEN, YOU WERE FUNNY.

31:18.943 --> 31:20.612
AND THEN, YOU-- THEN YOU WERE A
SAD MAN.

31:20.678 --> 31:22.280
AND THEN YOU--"
YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT REALLY, TO

31:22.347 --> 31:24.549
ME-- RANGE.

31:24.616 --> 31:26.951
YOU KNOW, YOU GO INSIDE
THE--
THE PERSON, YOU KNOW.

31:27.018 --> 31:28.319
>> Wertheim: IS THERE RANGE
WITHIN A CHARACTER?

31:28.386 --> 31:29.554
>> Keaton: YEAH.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.389
BECAUSE THEY'RE HUMAN
BEINGS,
YOU KNOW.

31:31.456 --> 31:34.292
>> Wertheim: AND THAT
INCLUDES
ONE SUPERHERO.

31:34.359 --> 31:36.928
THIS MAY BE THE RANCH
"BATMAN"
BUILT.

31:36.995 --> 31:40.265
KEATON BOUGHT IT IN 1989,
THE
SAME YEAR AS HIS BIGGEST

31:40.331 --> 31:40.865
BLOCKBUSTER.

31:40.932 --> 31:43.868
>> Keaton: ALL RIGHT, LISTEN...

31:43.935 --> 31:46.271
>> Wertheim: BUT BY THEN, HE HAD
ALREADY ESTABLISHED HIS M.O.,

31:46.337 --> 31:50.908
DELIVERING A CERTAIN
BELIEVABILITY TO A BROAD
ARRAY

31:50.975 --> 31:52.277
OF CHARACTERS: A
STAY-AT-HOME
DAD, A CRAZY-HAIRED

31:52.343 --> 31:54.445
POLTERGEIST...

31:54.512 --> 31:56.381
>> Keaton: IT'S SHOWTIME!

31:56.447 --> 31:58.283
>> Wertheim: ...A WASHED-UP
ACTOR, A FOUNDER.

31:58.349 --> 32:04.956
IN EACH OF THEM, KEATON
DOES,
WELL, THAT KEATON THING.

32:05.023 --> 32:09.127
HE PROJECTS A DISARMING
INTENSITY.

32:09.193 --> 32:11.996
HIS BROWS ARCH.

32:12.063 --> 32:12.964
THE EYES NARROW.

32:13.031 --> 32:14.432
THE MOUTH PUCKERS.

32:14.499 --> 32:15.199
AND WE ARE BUYING HIS CHARACTER.

32:15.266 --> 32:16.334
>> Keaton: I'M HERE BECAUSE
I
THINK THE STORY IS WRONG.

32:16.401 --> 32:19.003
IS IT?

32:19.070 --> 32:20.938
>> Wertheim: EVEN BEFORE HIS
TRADEMARK STACCATO PATTER KICKS

32:21.005 --> 32:22.340
IN.

32:22.407 --> 32:24.942
>> Keaton: I USED TO KIND OF
THINK I HAD TO FLEE FROM--
ME,

32:25.009 --> 32:27.345
YOU KNOW.

32:27.412 --> 32:28.680
AND THEN LATER ON, THERE'S
SOMETHING IN ME THAT'S-- THAT'S

32:28.746 --> 32:31.015
OKAY.

32:31.082 --> 32:34.285
I WAS NEVER AFRAID TO GO TO A
DARK OR SCARY OR REALLY, REALLY,

32:34.352 --> 32:39.590
REALLY RAW PLACES-- EVER, EVER.

32:39.657 --> 32:42.694
BUT ALSO I DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK
BACK AND GO, "YOU KIND OF-- KIND

32:42.760 --> 32:44.095
OF WUSSED OUT," YOU KNOW?

32:44.162 --> 32:46.364
AND SOMETIMES THERE'S NO CRIME
IN SAYING, "THIS IS PRETTY EASY.

32:46.431 --> 32:48.933
JUST-- JUST OPEN YOUR MOUTH, AND
LET THE WORDS COME OUT, AND--

32:49.000 --> 32:50.968
AND TELL THE TRUTH."

32:51.035 --> 32:52.937
>> Wertheim: THIS SIXTH
SENSE
FOR AUTHENTICITY FIRST CAME
TO

32:53.004 --> 32:56.941
KEATON IN THE MOST UN-HOLLYWOOD
OF PLACES: KEATON'S HOME IN

32:57.008 --> 33:00.311
WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA.

33:00.378 --> 33:04.415
IT WAS A SEMINAL MOMENT IN HIS
CHILDHOOD WHEN HIS FAMILY WON A

33:04.482 --> 33:05.049
BLACK AND WHITE TV IN A RAFFLE.

33:05.116 --> 33:09.020
>> Keaton: SO WHAT I WATCHED AND
LEARNED AND-- AND GREW UP ON AND

33:09.087 --> 33:11.989
LOVED WAS REALLY TELEVISION--
OLD WESTERNS PRIMARILY, WHICH I

33:12.056 --> 33:12.757
LOVED.

33:12.824 --> 33:13.324
I WANTED TO BE THOSE PEOPLE.

33:13.391 --> 33:16.427
(<i> LAUGHS </i>)
>> Wertheim: YOU DIDN'T WANT TO

33:16.494 --> 33:16.994
BE GENE AUTRY.

33:17.061 --> 33:20.498
YOU WANTED TO BE THE COWBOY.

33:20.565 --> 33:20.998
>> Keaton: OH, YEAH.

33:21.065 --> 33:23.000
AND, YOU KNOW, THE THING IS, I
NEVER BOUGHT THOSE GUYS, EVEN AT

33:23.067 --> 33:24.602
A YOUNG AGE.

33:24.669 --> 33:25.169
I SAID, "THEY'RE TOO PRETTY.

33:25.236 --> 33:27.138
THEY'RE TOO CLEAN.

33:27.205 --> 33:28.406
THEY PROBABLY DON'T SMELL."

33:28.473 --> 33:29.807
FROM THE TIME I WAS YOUNG.

33:29.874 --> 33:33.010
I HAD TO BELIEVE EVERYTHING
I
WAS SEEING.

33:33.077 --> 33:36.280
>> Wertheim: MICHAEL KEATON GREW
UP THE YOUNGEST OF SEVEN KIDS,

33:36.347 --> 33:40.118
RAISED IN A WORKING-CLASS
TOWN
OUTSIDE PITTSBURGH.

33:40.184 --> 33:44.055
HIS FATHER WAS A CIVIL ENGINEER;
HIS MOTHER RAN THE SHOW AT HOME.

33:44.122 --> 33:46.424
KEATON WAS AN ALTAR-BOY--
LITERALLY-- AND HE SAYS, A

33:46.491 --> 33:49.060
DECENT STUDENT, AS LONG AS THERE
WERE NUNS AROUND.

33:49.127 --> 33:52.997
HE ATTENDED KENT STATE
UNIVERSITY FOR ONE YEAR, AND

33:53.064 --> 33:56.534
THEN SERIOUSLY COMMITTED TO WHAT
HAD, TILL THEN, BEEN VAGUE

33:56.601 --> 33:58.403
DESIGNS OF ACTING AND PERFORMING
STAND-UP COMEDY.

33:58.469 --> 34:01.305
>> Keaton: I MEAN, EVERYBODY HAS
THE HARD MEMORIES, THE

34:01.372 --> 34:04.475
EMBARRASSING TOUGH TIMES,
AND
THE DOWN TIMES.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.944
YOU KNOW, NO-- NO MONEY OR NO--
YOU KNOW, LIVING IN (<i> BLEEP </i>)

34:07.011 --> 34:07.912
PLACES.

34:07.979 --> 34:10.481
BUT THAT'S, LIKE-- THAT'S, LIKE,
NOT A BIG DEAL TO ME.

34:10.548 --> 34:12.383
YOU KNOW, THAT'S-- THAT'S
JUST
PART OF THE DEAL.

34:12.450 --> 34:14.752
>> Wertheim: BUT HIS
NOSTALGIA
HAS ITS LIMITS.

34:14.819 --> 34:16.687
HE RECALLS THE PERILS OF THE
OPEN MIC.

34:16.754 --> 34:20.024
I HEARD A STORY, WHEN YOU
FOLLOWED AN IRISH FOLK SINGER UP

34:20.091 --> 34:21.092
ON STAGE?

34:21.159 --> 34:22.260
>> Keaton: UGH.

34:22.326 --> 34:22.827
>> Wertheim: WHAT HAPPENED?

34:22.894 --> 34:25.463
>> Keaton: WELL, FIRST OF
ALL,
THIS (<i> BLEEP </i>) GUY WOULD
WEAR,

34:25.530 --> 34:29.100
LIKE, ONE OF THOSE KNIT
SWEATERS, LIKE, IN JULY.

34:29.167 --> 34:32.170
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE,
LIKE,
FISHERMAN SWEATERS.

34:32.236 --> 34:34.472
>> Wertheim: HE'S COMMITTED
TO
THE ROLE.

34:34.539 --> 34:36.741
>> Keaton: YES, TOTALLY
COMMITTED TO THE ROLE, YOU KNOW.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.709
HE'S GOING TO SING THAT SONG
WHERE, LIKE, ALL THE KIDS IN THE

34:38.776 --> 34:40.478
FAMILY WENT DOWN IN THE SHIP,
YOU KNOW, IN THE COLD (<i> BLEEP </i>)

34:40.545 --> 34:42.413
IRISH SEA."

34:42.480 --> 34:44.382
AND I'M GOING TO GO, "HEY,
EVERYBODY, HOW YOU DOING?"

34:44.449 --> 34:46.484
>> Wertheim: NOT MUCH OF A WARM-
UP ACT.

34:46.551 --> 34:49.086
>> Keaton: NO.

34:49.153 --> 34:53.057
>> Wertheim: IN LOS ANGELES,
KEATON SHARPENED HIS IMPROV

34:53.124 --> 34:56.127
CHOPS IN THE CLUBS ON SUNSET AND
ON THE SMALL SCREEN.

34:56.194 --> 34:57.094
>> Keaton: I DO.

34:57.161 --> 35:00.198
>> Wertheim: THEN, HIS BIG
BREAK-- HE CAUGHT THE EYE OF
A

35:00.264 --> 35:01.566
SEASONED COMEDY WRITER WHO
RECOMMENDED HIM TO A HOT

35:01.632 --> 35:03.835
DIRECTOR IN TOWN.

35:03.901 --> 35:04.569
>> Keaton: I GOT AN
AUDITION.

35:04.635 --> 35:06.504
AND THEN I GOT A CALLBACK,
ANOTHER CALLBACK, ANOTHER

35:06.571 --> 35:08.372
CALLBACK, ANOTHER-- I THINK FIVE
OR SIX.

35:08.439 --> 35:10.274
>> Wertheim: ALL FOR THE ROLE OF
BILLY BLAZE.

35:10.341 --> 35:10.875
>> Keaton: YEAH, BILLY
BLAZE.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.443
YEAH.

35:12.510 --> 35:13.144
HOW YOU DOING?

35:13.211 --> 35:14.846
I'M BILL BLAZEJOWSKI.

35:14.912 --> 35:15.680
YOU CAN CALL ME BILLY BLAZE.

35:15.746 --> 35:16.547
YOU MUST BE CHUCK, RIGHT?

35:16.614 --> 35:18.783
NICE SHOES.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.152
>> Wertheim: "NIGHT SHIFT,"
DIRECTED BY RON HOWARD,
MARKED

35:21.219 --> 35:24.956
KEATON'S FIRST MOVIE, AN
ELECTRIC, BREAKOUT COMEDIC

35:25.022 --> 35:26.891
PERFORMANCE, ONE THAT STILL
HOLDS UP.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.326
>> Keaton: I NEED THE CAR KEYS.

35:28.392 --> 35:28.659
YOU GOT THEM?

35:28.726 --> 35:31.629
THANK YOU.

35:31.696 --> 35:34.532
>> Wertheim: WITH LICENSE TO
IMPROV, HE STEALS SCENE
AFTER

35:34.599 --> 35:37.468
SCENE AS BILL BLAZEJOWSKI,
THE
ANTIC-FRANTIC MORGUE
ATTENDANT

35:37.535 --> 35:40.538
MOONLIGHTING AS A PIMP.

35:40.605 --> 35:41.172
>> Keaton: LOVE BROKERS, HA, HA!

35:41.239 --> 35:43.708
>> Wertheim: YOU SEEMED TO
GET
THAT GUY.

35:43.774 --> 35:45.142
>> Keaton: YEAH, I GOT THAT GUY.

35:45.209 --> 35:48.045
IT WAS KIND OF THERE ON THE
PAGE.

35:48.112 --> 35:49.347
YOU KNOW, THE-- LIKE, I'M AN
IDEA MAN, THAT WAS THE

35:49.413 --> 35:50.882
FUNDAMENTAL THING.

35:50.948 --> 35:52.550
THIS IS BILL.

35:52.617 --> 35:55.987
IDEA TO ELIMINATE GARBAGE:
EDIBLE PAPER.

35:56.053 --> 35:58.055
AND THEY WERE WELCOMING IN
ALL
THE IMPROV.

35:58.122 --> 35:59.724
>> Wertheim: YOU COULD BRING
YOUR IMPROV CHOPS.

35:59.790 --> 36:00.491
>> Keaton: YEAH, YEAH.

36:00.558 --> 36:01.125
YEAH, THEY WERE GOOD ABOUT THAT.

36:01.192 --> 36:02.360
>> Wertheim: KIND OF THE BEST OF
BOTH WORLDS.

36:02.426 --> 36:03.094
YOU'RE NOT DOING STAND-UP.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.629
BUT, LIKE--
>> Keaton: 100%.

36:04.695 --> 36:07.331
>> Wertheim: HE WOULD LEAN ON
THOSE SKILLS ONE YEAR LATER, IN

36:07.398 --> 36:08.599
"MR. MOM."

36:08.666 --> 36:10.568
>> Keaton: WE'RE GOING TO
RIP
THESE WALLS OUT, AND THEN,
OF

36:10.635 --> 36:10.968
COURSE, REWIRE IT.

36:11.035 --> 36:13.437
>> Ron Richardson: YEAH, YOU'RE
GOING TO MAKE IT ALL 220?

36:13.504 --> 36:16.607
>> Keaton: YEAH, 220, 221,
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

36:16.674 --> 36:20.444
>> Wertheim: BUT RIGHT
BEFORE
HOLLYWOOD COULD CORNER
KEATON

36:20.511 --> 36:25.216
SOLELY AS A COMEDIC ACTOR,
HE
SWIVELED IN THE OPPOSITE

36:25.283 --> 36:28.419
DIRECTION, WITH MOVIES LIKE
"CLEAN AND SOBER" AND THE

36:28.486 --> 36:28.986
THRILLER "PACIFIC HEIGHTS."

36:29.053 --> 36:30.855
NOT A LOT OF TYPECASTING
HERE.

36:30.922 --> 36:32.323
ACCIDENT OR DESIGN?

36:32.390 --> 36:34.625
>> Keaton: I WANTED TO SET IT UP
SO THAT I HAD MORE SHOTS.

36:34.692 --> 36:37.662
I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO PLAY
A
LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS.

36:37.728 --> 36:40.264
BECAUSE, I LEARNED REAL QUICKLY
THAT THEY WERE GOING, "OH, WE

36:40.331 --> 36:40.798
LIKE WHEN HE DOES THAT.

36:40.865 --> 36:41.232
GET HIM TO DO THAT.

36:41.299 --> 36:44.602
LET'S HIRE HIM TO DO THAT
THING."

36:44.669 --> 36:46.604
I THOUGHT, "OH BOY, THAT COULD,
I THINK, FRANKLY, I WOULD HAVE

36:46.671 --> 36:47.872
BEEN OUT OF THE BUSINESS."

36:47.939 --> 36:52.610
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN, IF
THEY'RE NOT BORED ALREADY, BORED

36:52.677 --> 36:53.210
TO TEARS EARLY WITH ME.

36:53.277 --> 36:57.648
>> Wertheim: THIS OVERLAY OF
LIGHT AND DARK CONVINCED

36:57.715 --> 37:01.185
DIRECTOR TIM BURTON THAT MICHAEL
KEATON WAS RIGHT FOR THE LEAD IN

37:01.252 --> 37:04.689
HIS NEXT BIG BUDGET MOVIE:
"BATMAN."

37:04.755 --> 37:09.293
KEATON WOULD EMBODY BRUCE WAYNE
AS A COMPLICATED, EVEN TORMENTED

37:09.360 --> 37:10.695
TYCOON, HELL-BENT ON
JUSTICE.

37:10.761 --> 37:14.465
HARDCORE FANS OF THE DC
COMIC
HERO WERE HORRIFIED ABOUT

37:14.532 --> 37:16.667
CASTING MR. MOM AS THE CAPED
CRUSADER.

37:16.734 --> 37:20.171
>> Man: WHAT ARE YOU?

37:20.237 --> 37:21.272
>> Keaton: I'M BATMAN.

37:21.339 --> 37:22.673
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A LONG MEMORY.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.810
YOU KNOW, SO A COUPLE OCCASIONS
WHERE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WERE

37:25.876 --> 37:29.313
KIND OF-- NOT JUST, MAYBE
DID
MORE THAN DOUBT YOU.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.749
YOU GO, "OKAY, I'LL WAIT."

37:31.816 --> 37:33.618
>> Wertheim: PEERS, OR
REVIEWERS, OR?

37:33.684 --> 37:36.220
>> Keaton: JUST THINGS THAT
HAPPENED A COUPLE TIMES.

37:36.287 --> 37:36.854
YOU JUST KIND OF CLOCK IT.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.656
>> Wertheim: YOU REMEMBER
THAT
STUFF.

37:38.723 --> 37:39.690
>> Keaton: YEAH.

37:39.757 --> 37:41.292
>> Wertheim: SO YOU'RE
COMING
INTO THIS ROLE, AND YOU'RE
THE

37:41.359 --> 37:43.794
NEW BATMAN.

37:43.861 --> 37:45.262
>> Keaton: YEAH, YEAH.

37:45.329 --> 37:46.197
NO, I AM THE-- BATMAN.

37:46.263 --> 37:46.831
>> Wertheim: YOU'RE THE BATMAN.

37:46.897 --> 37:47.465
BUT YOU'VE GOT THIS
LINEAGE...

37:47.531 --> 37:48.833
>> Keaton: YEAH.

37:48.899 --> 37:49.367
LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.402
NO, I'M KIDDING.

37:51.469 --> 37:54.872
(<i> LAUGHS </i>)
BATMAN, THE FIRST BATMAN, I

37:54.939 --> 37:57.274
THINK TIM AND I BOTH KNEW IF
THAT DOESN'T WORK, THAT ONE,
I

37:57.341 --> 37:58.743
HAD AWARENESS OF.

37:58.809 --> 38:00.378
I THOUGHT, "OOH, THIS-- THIS
COULD REALLY FAIL."

38:00.444 --> 38:02.279
(<i> LAUGHS </i>)
>> Wertheim: YEAH, I MEAN,
IT

38:02.346 --> 38:03.881
STRIKES ME, THAT'S ANOTHER RISK
OF A DIFFERENT KIND, RIGHT?

38:03.948 --> 38:04.749
>> Keaton: YEAH.

38:04.815 --> 38:05.349
YEAH.

38:05.416 --> 38:08.419
THERE WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE
ON
THAT MOVIE FOR EVERYBODY.

38:08.486 --> 38:13.357
>> Wertheim: HOLY
GAMBLE-THAT-
PAID-OFF, BATMAN.

38:13.424 --> 38:16.761
THE MOVIE MADE MORE THAN $400
MILLION AND CATAPULTED KEATON TO

38:16.827 --> 38:19.797
A NEW PLANE OF STARDOM--
PROOF
THAT RESISTING CONVENTIONAL

38:19.864 --> 38:21.565
HOLLYWOOD WISDOM HAD ITS
ADVANTAGES.

38:21.632 --> 38:26.704
KEATON CONTINUED HIS GAME OF
CHARACTER HOPSCOTCH IN
ANOTHER

38:26.771 --> 38:28.806
30 MOVIES, FROM SHAKESPEARE
TO
"SPOTLIGHT."

38:28.873 --> 38:33.344
SOME BROUGHT MORE BOX OFFICE
SUCCESS THAN OTHERS.

38:33.411 --> 38:37.014
BUT WHEN HE WASN'T ACTING,
KEATON WAS A HANDS-ON DAD TO HIS

38:37.081 --> 38:39.383
SON SEAN, WHO IS NOW 38 AND
A
SUCCESSFUL SONGWRITER IN LOS

38:39.450 --> 38:40.351
ANGELES.

38:40.418 --> 38:45.356
AND KEATON HAD REACHED A
POINT
WHERE HE COULD BE CHOOSY.

38:45.423 --> 38:50.895
IN 2014, ENTER "BIRDMAN,"
AND
KEATON'S ALMOST ABSURDIST
ROLE

38:50.961 --> 38:52.563
THAT EARNED HIM A GOLDEN
GLOBE
FOR BEST ACTOR.

38:52.630 --> 38:53.064
HARDEST ROLE YOU'VE HAD?

38:53.130 --> 38:54.532
>> Keaton: MOSTLY, YEAH.

38:54.598 --> 38:57.568
IT HAD TO BE SO SPECIFIC, AND SO
PRECISE.

38:57.635 --> 39:00.871
YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO BE, LIKE, ON
A CERTAIN WORD, OR A POINT IN

39:00.938 --> 39:04.809
THE SENTENCE, AND GEOGRAPHICALLY
IN A SPOT.

39:04.875 --> 39:09.280
LIKE, ON-- IN A HALLWAY OR DOWN
A SET OF STAIRS.

39:09.346 --> 39:09.814
SPECIFICALLY WORD PERFECT.

39:09.880 --> 39:10.815
AND IT WAS REALLY HARD.

39:10.881 --> 39:13.417
SCARY EVERY DAY.

39:13.484 --> 39:15.753
>> Wertheim: DO PEOPLE IN
YOUR
LINE OF WORK HAVE RIVALS,
LIKE

39:15.820 --> 39:16.754
ATHLETES?

39:16.821 --> 39:17.955
I MEAN, ARE YOU, YOU KNOW, "HEY,
BILL MURRAY, I'M COMING FOR

39:18.022 --> 39:19.256
YOU"?

39:19.323 --> 39:20.291
>> Keaton: I DON'T KNOW.

39:20.357 --> 39:21.425
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE THING.

39:21.492 --> 39:22.827
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

39:22.893 --> 39:24.995
YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T GO, LIKE, BOX
EACH OTHER.

39:25.062 --> 39:26.997
(<i> LAUGHS </i>)
YOU KNOW, I MEAN.

39:27.064 --> 39:28.799
WE'RE ALL IN A BROTHER AND
SISTERHOOD TO SOME DEGREE,
YOU

39:28.866 --> 39:29.467
KNOW?

39:29.533 --> 39:33.270
LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE CRITICISM OF
PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCES I FIND

39:33.337 --> 39:33.871
REALLY BUSH LEAGUE, YOU
KNOW?

39:33.938 --> 39:37.374
IT'S LIKE, "WHAT DO I KNOW?" I'M
NOT SURE I EVEN KNOW ENOUGH.

39:37.441 --> 39:37.908
AND I'M NOT BEING HUMBLE.

39:37.975 --> 39:40.578
I'M BEING HONEST.

39:40.644 --> 39:41.812
I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW THAT I
EVEN KNOW ENOUGH TO SAY, "WELL,

39:41.879 --> 39:44.849
THAT'S NOT ANY GOOD."

39:44.915 --> 39:46.817
>> Wertheim: IN HIS LATEST
PROJECT, KEATON IS BACK TO

39:46.884 --> 39:49.420
INTERPRETING THE AMERICAN MALE.

39:49.487 --> 39:52.823
"DOPESICK," OUT THIS MONTH, IS A
HULU MINI-SERIES ABOUT THE

39:52.890 --> 39:54.492
COUNTRY'S OPIOID EPIDEMIC.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.727
>> Keaton: I WOULD NEVER
PRESCRIBE A NARCOTIC FOR

39:56.794 --> 39:57.394
MODERATE PAIN.

39:57.461 --> 40:01.398
>> Wertheim: KEATON PLAYS A
DOCTOR IN A COAL-MINING TOWN

40:01.465 --> 40:03.100
OVERWHELMED BY OXYCONTIN.

40:03.167 --> 40:05.402
BUT THIS TIME, HE ADMITS THERE'S
A LITTLE MORE TO THE PART.

40:05.469 --> 40:09.940
>> Keaton: YOU KNOW, THAT MEANS
A LOT TO ME, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

40:10.007 --> 40:13.177
I LOST A NEPHEW TO FENTANYL AND
HEROIN.

40:13.244 --> 40:16.180
>> Wertheim: WHAT'S IT LIKE WHEN
YOU HAVE THIS KIND OF PERSONAL

40:16.247 --> 40:16.814
CONNECTION TO A ROLE?

40:16.881 --> 40:21.418
>> Keaton: YOU HAVE TO
REMOVE
THE EMOTION AND JUST, LIKE I

40:21.485 --> 40:25.422
KEEP SAYING, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S--
WHAT'S THE JOB AT HAND, YOU

40:25.489 --> 40:28.826
KNOW, WHAT'S-- I'M JUST A
STORYTELLER.

40:28.893 --> 40:32.630
>> Wertheim: BEFITTING A MAN WHO
PIVOTS FROM ROLE TO ROLE, KEATON

40:32.696 --> 40:33.964
IS ESPECIALLY THRILLED BY
PITTSBURGH'S TRANSITION FROM

40:34.031 --> 40:36.767
STEEL TO TECH.

40:36.834 --> 40:40.471
HE RETURNS HOME OFTEN, AND
INVITED US TO A MODIFIED
STEEL

40:40.538 --> 40:44.942
MILL-TURNED-INNOVATION
CENTER
NOT FAR FROM WHERE HE GREW
UP.

40:45.009 --> 40:48.512
KEATON IS AN INVESTOR IN A
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, NEXII,

40:48.579 --> 40:51.315
THAT HERE IN PITTSBURGH PLANS TO
MAKE ECO-FRIENDLY ALTERNATIVES

40:51.382 --> 40:52.817
TO CONCRETE.

40:52.883 --> 40:53.417
>> Keaton: I GET THIS.

40:53.484 --> 40:57.421
AND I ACTUALLY LIKE IT.

40:57.488 --> 41:01.225
AND IF I'M GOING TO-- MAN, JUST
LOOK AT THIS SUMMER.

41:01.292 --> 41:04.895
IF I'M GOING TO HAVE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO DO ANYTHING
AND

41:04.962 --> 41:07.631
PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS,
YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE AN OPINION

41:07.698 --> 41:08.399
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE
ANYMORE.

41:08.465 --> 41:08.999
IT'S, LIKE, HERE, NOW.

41:09.066 --> 41:10.701

DUE, HUH?

41:10.768 --> 41:11.202

41:11.268 --> 41:13.470
THE BILL'S-- THE BILL'S COME
DUE.

41:13.537 --> 41:16.407
>> Wertheim: KEATON WOULD
HAPPILY SPEND MORE TIME
HERE--

41:16.473 --> 41:20.477
AND IN MONTANA-- IF IT
WEREN'T
FOR THAT PESKY DAY JOB.

41:20.544 --> 41:22.580
HE JUST FINISHED FILMING
"THE
FLASH," REPRISING HIS ROLE
AS

41:22.646 --> 41:25.482
BATMAN, 30 YEARS AFTER HE
LEFT
THE FRANCHISE.

41:25.549 --> 41:28.886
AND WE HAD TO KNOW-- BUT, IS
THIS BRUCE WAYNE STILL THE

41:28.953 --> 41:33.490
TORTURED, SOMEWHAT DARK
FIGURE
HE WAS, AS WE RECALL?

41:33.557 --> 41:34.892
>> Keaton: ISH.

41:34.959 --> 41:40.865
HE'S KIND OF-- YOU KNOW, I CAN'T
GIVE TOO MUCH OF THIS AWAY.

41:40.931 --> 41:42.800
I'M ONE OF THOSE GUYS WHO GOES,
"WELL, I-- I-- I'M NOT GIVING

41:42.867 --> 41:43.767
THAT (<i> BLEEP </i>) AWAY."

41:43.834 --> 41:44.635
GO SEE THE MOVIE.

41:44.702 --> 41:46.871
>> Wertheim: HOW'S THE
COSTUME
FIT?

41:46.937 --> 41:49.473
>> Keaton: PROUD TO SAY, I
SLIPPED RIGHT BACK INTO IT.

41:49.540 --> 41:52.509
>> Wertheim: YOU'RE 70 YEARS
OLD, AND YOU'RE STILL
KICKING

41:52.576 --> 41:52.877
BAD GUYS' ASS.

41:52.943 --> 41:55.045
THAT'S GOT TO FEEL GOOD.

41:55.112 --> 41:56.080
>> Keaton: YEAH.

41:56.146 --> 41:57.481
IF YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHOSE
ASS
NEEDS KICKED, JUST DON'T
CALL

41:57.548 --> 41:58.549
ME.

41:58.616 --> 42:03.320
(<i> LAUGHS </i>)
(<i> TICKING </i>)

42:07.591 --> 42:09.760
>> Whitaker: WITH THE DEATH
OF
GENERAL COLIN POWELL THIS
PAST

42:09.827 --> 42:13.764
WEEK, AMERICA LOST ONE MORE
OF
ITS DWINDLING SUPPLY OF WISE

42:13.831 --> 42:17.468
MEN, AND WISE WOMEN-- WASHINGTON
HANDS WITH SEASONED PERSPECTIVE

42:17.534 --> 42:21.405
WHO COULD TELL A PRESIDENT WHEN
HE IS WRONG.

42:21.472 --> 42:23.173
LIKE GENERAL POWELL, THEY
WEREN'T ALWAYS RIGHT, BUT COULD

42:23.240 --> 42:28.112
BE TRUSTED TO HOLD THE NATION'S
INTEREST ABOVE PERSONAL

42:28.178 --> 42:29.179
AMBITION.

42:29.246 --> 42:32.650
SAM NUNN, OLYMPIA SNOWE, AND
GEORGE MITCHELL CAME FROM
THE

42:32.716 --> 42:33.417
SENATE.

42:33.484 --> 42:37.755
JIM BAKER WAS AN
ESTABLISHMENT
LAWYER.

42:37.821 --> 42:40.724
A FEW WERE FROM WALL STREET, OR,
LIKE GENERAL POWELL, FROM THE

42:40.791 --> 42:41.158
MILITARY.

42:41.225 --> 42:45.763
LAST SUNDAY ON THIS
BROADCAST,
WE HEARD FROM ANOTHER,
ROBERT

42:45.829 --> 42:47.331
GATES, WHO ROSE THROUGH THE
NATIONAL SECURITY AND

42:47.398 --> 42:49.767
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES.

42:49.833 --> 42:53.170
MOST OF THEM ARE NOW RETIRED OR
GONE.

42:53.237 --> 42:56.473
WE CAN ONLY WONDER IF THE
PRESENT STATE OF AMERICAN

42:56.540 --> 42:59.176
POLITICS IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING
THEIR SUCCESSORS.

42:59.243 --> 43:01.745
I'M BILL WHITAKER.

43:01.812 --> 43:06.917
WE'LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK WITH
