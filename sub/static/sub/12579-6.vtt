00:32.470 --> 00:34.836
Bobby, you ought to leave a burger
for your mother.

00:34.940 --> 00:36.908
She'll be hungry after her big meeting.

00:37.008 --> 00:38.999
She knows what time dinner is.

00:39.110 --> 00:40.805
Boys, slap me five.

00:40.912 --> 00:44.006
The school picked my float design
for the Veterans Day parade.

00:44.115 --> 00:48.017
We are recreating the famous
flag-raising scene at Iwo Jima.

00:48.119 --> 00:51.179
Like last year's school float.

00:51.289 --> 00:54.417
Yes. But what Principal Moss loved most...

00:54.526 --> 00:57.393
about my idea was
how authentic it will be.

00:57.495 --> 00:59.986
Each mannequin
will be wearing authentic medals...

01:00.098 --> 01:02.726
awarded for bravery at Iwo Jima.

01:02.834 --> 01:04.825
Hey, you know who might
have some of those?

01:04.936 --> 01:07.928
That oddball
who runs that bric-a-brac store.

01:08.607 --> 01:10.199
Moved to Provincedale. No.

01:10.308 --> 01:12.674
In my capacity
as float committee chairman...

01:12.777 --> 01:15.245
I will place a toll call
to your father in Houston...

01:15.347 --> 01:18.248
and ask him for his Purple Heart,
Silver Star...

01:18.350 --> 01:21.217
and whatever else they gave him
for killing all those Japanese.

01:23.288 --> 01:26.724
Boy, this is a choice cut
of North Carolina pine.

01:26.825 --> 01:29.089
The perfect wood to honor our veterans.

01:29.194 --> 01:31.788
It will be under 600 pounds of sand.

01:31.896 --> 01:35.525
- Don't blow our budget, Hank. Use that.
- Particle board?

01:35.634 --> 01:38.865
Yeah, if you want to throw out your float
in five or ten years.

01:38.970 --> 01:41.268
COTTON: Stand on your tiptoes,
Didi woman.

01:41.573 --> 01:43.803
Dad? What are you doing in Arlen?

01:43.908 --> 01:47.036
Buying one hundred
and ninety-two diapers.

01:47.145 --> 01:49.010
- Hank's wife.
- Cotton.

01:49.114 --> 01:51.844
I have been calling you.
How long have you been in town?

01:51.950 --> 01:55.647
A week. We're staying over to the VFW.
We love it there.

01:55.754 --> 01:58.689
Didi and the baby love it there, too.
Ain't that right, wife?

01:58.790 --> 02:02.521
It's just like a second honeymoon.
Only, it's not El Paso.

02:02.694 --> 02:04.992
A week? Why didn't you call?

02:05.096 --> 02:07.656
I only call the people I want to see.

02:12.937 --> 02:16.373
They're taking out that yield sign
by the Ethan Allen.

02:16.474 --> 02:18.533
Lives will be lost.

02:19.377 --> 02:22.835
Smells like pancakes. I'll have waffles.

02:22.947 --> 02:26.212
Grandpa, I was wondering
when I would get to see you.

02:26.317 --> 02:29.309
And how's my Uncle G.H?

02:29.421 --> 02:33.016
- Waffles! Where's my waffles?
- They're coming right up.

02:33.124 --> 02:36.582
And, Cotton, can I borrow
your war medals for my float, please?

02:36.695 --> 02:38.595
What! I needs them medals.

02:38.697 --> 02:40.892
I'll be wearing them
in the Veterans Parade.

02:40.999 --> 02:42.091
That's right, Bobby.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.533
Your granddad carries the flag
every year down in Houston.

02:45.637 --> 02:46.934
Not this year, Bobby.

02:47.038 --> 02:50.633
I'll be marching here in Arlen
with my war buddies.

02:50.742 --> 02:54.405
Topsy, Brooklyn, Fat Brooklyn
and, of course, Erwin Linker.

02:54.512 --> 02:56.707
- What happened to Lucky?
- Dead!

02:57.315 --> 02:58.509
Good going, Dale.

02:58.616 --> 03:01.642
That looks like some top-quality sand
you got there.

03:01.753 --> 03:04.187
Yeah, they won't be building
any sand castles...

03:04.289 --> 03:07.520
over at Staubach Elementary this week.

03:07.826 --> 03:10.124
Look what I signed out for the weekend.

03:10.228 --> 03:13.857
It might not shift out of second,
but it'll tow a float eight city blocks.

03:13.965 --> 03:18.834
Or if we attach a steel extrusion
to the front, we could push the float.

03:21.506 --> 03:25.465
Am I the only one who allows his mind
to prance outside the box?

03:33.251 --> 03:35.515
Hello? Cotton?

03:35.620 --> 03:39.056
Peggy, my step-daughter-in-law,
why are you here?

03:39.157 --> 03:42.991
Well, I came across
this box of brand new cigars.

03:43.094 --> 03:46.791
And I know how much
Cotton enjoys cigars, so...

03:46.898 --> 03:49.560
These are not Cotton's brand.
He won't like them.

03:49.667 --> 03:51.726
But I do. I'll smoke them.

03:55.373 --> 03:58.672
Oh, my. You certainly have brought a lot
for your vacation.

03:58.777 --> 04:01.769
And in which box
would I find Cotton's war medals, please?

04:01.880 --> 04:04.508
The medals
are in a locked display case in the lobby...

04:04.616 --> 04:07.676
next to the vending machine
where we get dinner.

04:16.094 --> 04:18.721
COTTON: Come on, Topsy,
is you in or is you out?

04:18.829 --> 04:22.266
Thems is rich pot.

04:22.367 --> 04:23.356
I fold.

04:23.468 --> 04:26.767
- Yoo-hoo, Dad!
- Entertainment's here.

04:26.871 --> 04:31.001
- Take off your top!
- It's Hank's wife.

04:31.109 --> 04:32.906
What do you want? I'm up 8 cents.

04:33.011 --> 04:37.038
Well, I noticed your authentic war medals
in the lobby display.

04:37.148 --> 04:41.949
Right, you want my medals.
Okay, I'll give them to you.

04:42.220 --> 04:46.589
Cost you $200 a day.
There's only one way you can make that.

04:46.691 --> 04:50.627
Except, you're 20 years too old,
and 20 pounds too skinny.

04:50.728 --> 04:53.561
Cotton Hill,
I do not know what I hate more about you.

04:53.665 --> 04:54.962
The way you talk to me...

04:55.066 --> 04:57.933
or the way you treat your wife
and your little child.

04:58.036 --> 04:59.526
Well, think about it.

05:02.540 --> 05:04.838
PEGGY: Selfish.

05:04.943 --> 05:07.673
He is making his wife
and your little brother...

05:07.779 --> 05:11.442
stay in that tiny room
just so he can play cards all day...

05:11.549 --> 05:15.144
- with that foul-mouthed Erwin Linker.
- It's not all bad.

05:15.253 --> 05:18.313
G.H., is too young to understand
cuss words...

05:18.423 --> 05:21.256
and the Brooklyns are very good with him.
I've seen it.

05:21.359 --> 05:23.827
Rob Reiner says that the first year of life...

05:23.928 --> 05:26.362
is the most important
to a child's development.

05:26.464 --> 05:29.262
Your baby brother
should be listening to lullabies...

05:29.367 --> 05:33.303
- not to old men hacking up phlegm.
- All right.

05:33.404 --> 05:36.237
I'll go down there tomorrow
and talk to my dad.

05:37.342 --> 05:40.641
Do you think the nail on my pinky toe
will ever grow back?

05:42.480 --> 05:44.209
[Car horn blaring]

05:44.515 --> 05:48.474
You're supposed to yield, you...
Not anymore.

05:48.586 --> 05:51.111
Thanks a lot, Councilman Fred Ebberd.

05:51.222 --> 05:52.211
Jerk.

05:52.323 --> 05:55.224
COTTON: Are you chewing my shorts?
HANK: What in the...

05:55.326 --> 05:56.588
Count them again!

05:56.694 --> 05:59.254
There's 53 cans there, a nickel a pop.

05:59.364 --> 06:01.525
You owe me $2.65.

06:01.633 --> 06:05.160
- Sir, there are only 50 cans here.
- Fifty-three.

06:05.270 --> 06:07.261
This hobo took three cans from my pile.

06:07.372 --> 06:09.704
I got those cans from a sewer
outside the bus station.

06:09.807 --> 06:12.742
Them three cans was my cans.
I smashed them myself.

06:12.844 --> 06:14.505
- Smashed them good.
- You're lying.

06:14.612 --> 06:16.807
This dumpster monkey is lying.

06:16.915 --> 06:19.179
Whoever hands me the cans
gets the money.

06:19.284 --> 06:21.479
- Here.
- What the cussburg!

06:21.586 --> 06:25.147
I need that money. Give me that.
They took my house!

06:25.256 --> 06:28.919
I gots to live in the VFW. I'm broke.

06:29.027 --> 06:30.187
Broke?

06:35.300 --> 06:38.667
You have no money
and you lost the house in Houston?

06:38.770 --> 06:40.101
How could this happen?

06:40.204 --> 06:44.402
- Did you blow it all on exotic dancers?
- Don't you judge me.

06:44.509 --> 06:47.137
My pension barely covered me
and the woman.

06:47.245 --> 06:49.475
I didn't plan on busting through
my wienie shield...

06:49.580 --> 06:50.808
and having this little fellow.

06:50.915 --> 06:55.852
And I can't deny him anything
in the world. No, I can't.

06:55.954 --> 06:59.788
Cotton tried to find a job in Houston
but nobody wanted him.

06:59.891 --> 07:03.054
Didi, you're a certified
optometrical assistant.

07:03.161 --> 07:07.029
- There's a Lenscrafters down at the...
- No wife of mine is gonna work.

07:07.398 --> 07:11.232
Look, Dad, I've got a few extra dollars
in my passbook account.

07:11.336 --> 07:13.668
- I could help you out.
- You ain't my daddy.

07:13.771 --> 07:15.705
I'm your daddy.

07:15.807 --> 07:18.105
- Topsy!
- Yeah.

07:18.209 --> 07:21.337
Show Hank the door.

07:22.513 --> 07:25.346
All right, back off. God.

07:25.450 --> 07:27.509
Dad, I could talk to Buck Strickland...

07:27.618 --> 07:30.519
about getting you a job
at Strickland Propane.

07:30.655 --> 07:35.251
I don't need your charity job!
I got me an interview tomorrow.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.419
Getting back into the insulation business.

07:37.528 --> 07:40.554
The same work that kept your mother
in JC Penney skirts...

07:40.665 --> 07:44.294
and paid for your glasses all them years,
four eyes.

07:46.838 --> 07:48.863
I'm your man, Mr. Lewis.

07:48.973 --> 07:51.669
I supervised the installation of asbestos...

07:51.776 --> 07:56.076
in every public school in Heimlich County
and 11 bowling alleys.

07:57.048 --> 08:00.950
Yeah, our company
is paid to remove asbestos.

08:01.052 --> 08:05.421
What? Remove asbestos?
What the hell for?

08:06.090 --> 08:10.151
You wrote on your application
that you're 38 years old?

08:10.261 --> 08:12.627
- Is that right?
- Indeed.

08:12.730 --> 08:16.928
I tend to look older because the Japanese
shot my shins off in the war.

08:17.035 --> 08:20.562
- Which war?
- Gulf War.

08:20.705 --> 08:24.141
Now, hold on there.
You can't ask an applicant his age.

08:24.242 --> 08:26.870
- I'm sorry, who is this?
- I'm his son.

08:27.578 --> 08:28.738
Gulf War baby.

08:28.846 --> 08:31.576
Saddam's chemicals
made him freakishly large.

08:31.682 --> 08:33.980
Yeah, we'll be sure to give you a call.

08:38.222 --> 08:41.714
I tell you, Hank, ever since you sold me
those propane patio heaters...

08:41.826 --> 08:44.852
people have been eating outside
even when it's cold.

08:44.962 --> 08:48.557
Clean, even heating
is just one of the 14 reasons...

08:48.666 --> 08:50.896
Yeah, I remember your toast
at my daughter's wedding.

08:51.002 --> 08:55.701
Now, listen, if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just give me a holler.

08:56.240 --> 09:00.142
Mr. Burton,
are you a fan of World War II heroes?

09:02.246 --> 09:05.113
So you're my Uncle Burt's new hire.
Now, this is your stool.

09:05.216 --> 09:07.582
When people come in,
you give them the special greeting.

09:07.685 --> 09:09.152
Did you learn the special greeting?

09:09.253 --> 09:11.653
- I studied on it.
- Good for you.

09:11.756 --> 09:14.088
Break time's in an hour.
You get three ounces of beef...

09:14.192 --> 09:16.956
or five ounces of chicken and one starch.

09:27.905 --> 09:29.532
Thank you.

09:30.241 --> 09:34.109
Welcome to Burton's.
The hostess will seat you.

09:37.215 --> 09:39.376
Welcome to Burton's.

09:39.717 --> 09:41.844
The hostess will seat you.

09:43.788 --> 09:46.689
She's tied up momentarily.

09:46.791 --> 09:48.315
Right this way.

09:50.928 --> 09:53.260
- What are you doing?
- They was waiting.

09:53.364 --> 09:55.958
- I'm showing them to a table.
- That's the hostess's job.

09:56.067 --> 09:58.535
You're a greeter.
Now, please return to your stool.

09:58.636 --> 10:00.866
Now, you listen to me, junior.

10:00.972 --> 10:04.305
I led a platoon of men
through the jungles of Saipan.

10:04.408 --> 10:08.640
I think I can lead a party of four
to Table 6!

10:09.614 --> 10:12.208
I'm sure you can. But right now...

10:12.316 --> 10:15.547
what I need you to do
is go back to your stool.

10:15.653 --> 10:16.915
You think I can't do it?

10:17.021 --> 10:21.390
I've done everything for this country.
I gave my shins to beat the Tojos.

10:21.492 --> 10:24.154
I bit a Nazi's windpipe in half!

10:24.295 --> 10:25.728
[Cotton exclaiming angrily]

10:34.972 --> 10:38.430
My stool? Where's the greeter's stool?

10:38.543 --> 10:39.908
MANAGER: Congratulations.

10:40.011 --> 10:42.377
You've been
promoted to Men's Room Attendant.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.708
What?

10:45.983 --> 10:47.644
[Toilet flushing]

10:51.122 --> 10:52.555
Sorry about that.

11:03.568 --> 11:05.798
Good afternoon, kinfolk!

11:05.903 --> 11:09.805
Who knew there was so much money
in greeting?

11:09.907 --> 11:12.933
Hop in, I'm gonna treat all the Hill boys
to some ice cream.

11:13.044 --> 11:16.980
- My work here is done.
- Cotton, look at the detail on this float.

11:17.081 --> 11:19.481
Now, I'd say it's a second-place float
right now.

11:19.584 --> 11:23.520
All it needs to move up to first
are authentic war medals.

11:23.621 --> 11:25.088
You're such a nag.

11:25.189 --> 11:27.157
Now I know why
Hank wants to divorce you.

11:27.258 --> 11:31.285
- Dad, there's not a shred of truth.
- Mull it over.

11:32.663 --> 11:36.724
- That's the one.
- Hey! Get out of my Cadillac car.

11:36.834 --> 11:37.823
It's my car now.

11:37.935 --> 11:39.903
You're five months
behind on your payments.

11:40.004 --> 11:43.371
Afternoon, ma'am. Wayne Pratley,
Pratley Cadillac and Hyundai.

11:43.474 --> 11:45.874
Hold on a minute now.
There's gotta be something...

11:45.977 --> 11:48.537
- that we can work out here.
- It's too late for that, Hank.

11:48.646 --> 11:51.080
But it's not too late
to put you into a brand new Sonata.

11:51.182 --> 11:55.312
Only 52,000 miles on her.
She's practically a dealer car.

11:55.419 --> 11:59.014
- I'll cut your guts out!
- Dad, no.

11:59.123 --> 12:01.717
WAYNE: You think about that Sonata,
Hank!

12:02.026 --> 12:03.891
COTTON: Get off my plug!

12:06.330 --> 12:09.629
Well, thank you very much, Hank...

12:09.734 --> 12:11.861
for helping me chop him up.

12:12.770 --> 12:14.795
You owe me a Cadillac car.

12:27.051 --> 12:28.143
Mr. Hill, you're late.

12:28.252 --> 12:32.018
Couldn't reach the ding cord on the bus.
Now, listen up, junior.

12:32.123 --> 12:35.559
I ain't gonna be here tomorrow.
I'm marching in the Veterans Parade...

12:35.660 --> 12:37.787
and I still get my full pay.

12:38.562 --> 12:39.961
Not on my watch.

12:40.064 --> 12:43.397
Veterans Day is one of our busiest days.
We're right on the parade route.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.799
I need you in the men's room
on your stool.

12:45.903 --> 12:50.465
You can't do that. I killed 50 men.
That parade's for me.

12:50.574 --> 12:53.475
Mr. Hill, maybe you have to re-evaluate...

12:53.577 --> 12:57.707
whether you really want to clean up
after my customers use the bathroom.

13:03.187 --> 13:06.884
Your mother stayed up all night
putting the finishing touches on that float.

13:06.991 --> 13:10.620
Never came to bed. What the...

13:10.728 --> 13:13.356
You put skeletons on Iwo Jima?

13:13.464 --> 13:16.991
Without your father's medals
the whole authentic concept didn't work.

13:17.101 --> 13:19.296
I had to go in a different direction.

13:19.403 --> 13:21.564
"The Futility of War."

13:21.672 --> 13:25.802
Peggy, you can't make fun of war heroes
in a Veterans Parade.

13:25.910 --> 13:29.539
- It is a tribute.
- Those are skeletons, Peggy!

13:29.647 --> 13:34.084
Old Halloween decorations were the best
I could do at 4:00 a.m., Hank.

13:34.185 --> 13:36.653
Sorry I'm late, I had to take three buses.

13:36.754 --> 13:37.982
One to get here...

13:38.089 --> 13:42.116
one to go back and get G.H.,
and then one to get here.

13:42.226 --> 13:44.524
- Where's my dad?
- He had to work.

13:44.628 --> 13:48.587
A veteran working on Veterans Day?
That ain't right.

14:06.417 --> 14:09.682
Dad, you in here?
They said you were back here.

14:09.787 --> 14:13.655
I'm on my break from my greeter's job.
What do you want? I'm busy.

14:13.758 --> 14:17.785
I stopped by the VFW
and picked up your dress uniform...

14:17.895 --> 14:18.919
your marching shoes.

14:19.029 --> 14:21.156
I can't march today.
I'm too big of a man here.

14:21.265 --> 14:22.994
Gots too much responsibility.

14:23.100 --> 14:26.729
Dad, you're the greatest war hero
Arlen's ever seen.

14:26.837 --> 14:29.863
- You should be marching in that parade.
- Can't.

14:30.775 --> 14:34.643
I'm just gonna leave your uniform
on this bar stool...

14:34.745 --> 14:36.736
if you change your mind.

14:42.787 --> 14:44.379
There he is!

14:54.031 --> 14:57.194
- I beg your pardon?
- Sorry.

14:58.202 --> 15:01.603
Would you believe this isn't the first time
that's happened to me?

15:01.705 --> 15:02.865
Ass.

15:02.973 --> 15:06.204
Happy Veterans Day.

15:27.498 --> 15:28.795
[Manager tut-tutting]

15:28.899 --> 15:32.062
I told you, we'll bring your meal in to you.

15:34.271 --> 15:37.536
Doing it for the baby.

15:48.252 --> 15:50.015
My Cadillac car.

15:53.157 --> 15:56.558
He clowned up my...
I'll get that son of a bitch.

16:01.065 --> 16:04.501
Good.
My dad decided to join the parade after all.

16:10.307 --> 16:11.638
Good Lord!

16:16.213 --> 16:17.805
I love a parade.

16:20.918 --> 16:22.681
[People clamoring]

16:28.259 --> 16:30.784
Scoot over. My dad stole his car back.

16:45.242 --> 16:46.300
LEWIS: If we can't agree on it...

16:46.410 --> 16:51.006
then Bob and I will go to Del Taco
and you two go to Taco Bell, okay?

16:51.115 --> 16:52.810
I ain't no stink-house porter.

16:52.917 --> 16:55.943
You think a shinless man
can't remove asbestos?

16:56.053 --> 17:00.183
I'll show you what a 75-year-old
shinless man can remove.

17:01.392 --> 17:02.757
[Men snickering softly]

17:05.462 --> 17:07.292
Told you it was a rug.

17:21.845 --> 17:25.109
Sixty and one smashed,
sixty and two smashed...

17:27.117 --> 17:30.917
sixty and three...
Go away, you. These are my cans.

17:31.021 --> 17:33.546
Hey, fingers,
you ain't counting fast enough.

17:33.657 --> 17:35.591
- Sixty and four.
- Sixty and five.

17:35.693 --> 17:38.457
Sixty and six, sixty-seven,
sixty-eight, nine...

17:38.562 --> 17:40.189
six and ten, six-eleven.

17:45.336 --> 17:47.964
Topsy, you shouldn't be waiting for a bus.

17:48.072 --> 17:50.973
You strangled Hermann Göring,
for God's sake!

17:52.610 --> 17:55.340
- Please don't kill me.
- I won't.

17:55.446 --> 17:59.075
But in a few minutes,
you is gonna wish you was dead.

18:03.654 --> 18:06.748
- Take your time, sir.
- Thanks.

18:12.029 --> 18:15.430
Outstanding work, Sergeant.
Reminds me of the old days.

18:15.532 --> 18:18.899
Who's next?

18:28.379 --> 18:30.472
There's nobody left.

18:30.581 --> 18:33.607
And I still ain't done nothing
to help my family.

18:35.085 --> 18:38.714
Come on, Colonel, this is where you say
"Topsy, let's roll." And you say...

18:38.822 --> 18:40.483
Sorry, Toppington.

18:40.591 --> 18:43.287
Some things a man has to do on his own.

18:50.901 --> 18:54.803
I'm sorry we never got to go
for that ice cream cone, Bobby.

18:54.905 --> 18:59.365
Looks like we're not gonna get the chance.
Just as well, I don't have any money.

18:59.476 --> 19:03.003
I've got that share of US Steel
you bought me when I was born.

19:03.113 --> 19:05.445
We could cash that in.

19:05.549 --> 19:07.483
You should put that money
into life insurance.

19:07.584 --> 19:11.611
Best thing I ever did.
I'm worth more dead than alive.

19:12.022 --> 19:15.753
What do you mean, Grandpa?
Is there a price on your head?

19:16.360 --> 19:17.827
Probably.

19:17.928 --> 19:21.329
Here you go. I've written you
a letter of recommendation for the Army.

19:21.432 --> 19:24.026
Give this to the general
when you turn 15.

19:40.884 --> 19:45.184
Dad, Grandpa was just here.
He was acting all weird.

19:45.289 --> 19:48.952
He kept talking about how important it is
to have life insurance.

19:49.059 --> 19:51.892
The Colonel
asked me for some ammunition...

19:51.995 --> 19:54.896
which, due to the spectacular failure...

19:54.998 --> 19:57.831
of Y2K, I had plenty of.

19:57.935 --> 20:01.371
- Knowing you, you gave it all to him.
- No.

20:01.472 --> 20:04.600
I tried to,
but he said he only needed one bullet.

20:04.708 --> 20:07.939
One bullet? Damn it, Dale.

20:15.219 --> 20:19.553
Cotton, I have been watching G.H. All day.
It is your turn.

20:19.656 --> 20:21.647
- Not now, woman.
- Yes, now.

20:21.759 --> 20:25.024
I need some "me" time to do the laundry.

20:30.734 --> 20:33.567
Dad! Dad, open up. Come on, let me in.

20:33.670 --> 20:35.900
Go away, this doesn't involve you.

20:36.006 --> 20:37.268
[Gunshot]

20:37.441 --> 20:38.533
Dad!

20:41.712 --> 20:44.272
Just taught the boy how to fire a gun.

20:44.381 --> 20:47.145
Look at him. He loves to shoot!

20:47.651 --> 20:50.643
You cried your first time
and you was three.

20:52.790 --> 20:56.556
- You were just... I thought you were...
- What?

20:57.027 --> 21:01.964
I was spending time with my favorite son.
You got a problem with that?

21:04.935 --> 21:07.130
No. No, I don't.

21:07.704 --> 21:09.433
Hank, I thought it over.

21:09.540 --> 21:11.735
I've decided
to let you give me some money.

21:11.842 --> 21:15.403
- You know, for G.H.
- I'm glad you've come around...

21:15.512 --> 21:18.345
- and I'm happy to help you out.
- It ain't help.

21:18.448 --> 21:21.417
You're paying me back
for all the money I spent raising you.

21:21.518 --> 21:24.487
Food, clothes, sissy lenses for your eyes.

21:24.588 --> 21:28.786
- Okay, Dad. That seems fair.
- It's more than fair.

21:28.892 --> 21:32.851
I ain't even charging you interest
because you're my son and all.

21:33.530 --> 21:35.464
Now, give me $300.

21:35.566 --> 21:38.467
I want to buy G.H.
And me a set of walkie-talkies.

21:38.569 --> 21:40.662
You know,
for when he learns to walk and talk.

21:40.771 --> 21:44.764
- I've got a $20 on me.
- $20?

21:44.875 --> 21:47.673
I got poop tips bigger than that.

22:29.553 --> 22:32.044
COTTON: Waffles! Where's my waffles?
