-That's not good.

00:07.290 --> 00:10.050
-What is this?

00:10.060 --> 00:12.169
Oh, [bleep].

00:12.179 --> 00:15.119
Donna, we're going to have to

00:12.179 --> 00:15.119
estivate the patient.

00:23.230 --> 00:25.230
I love the way

00:23.230 --> 00:25.230
my designer vagina looks

00:25.239 --> 00:27.219
in a cute camel toe.

00:27.230 --> 00:29.059
Like, go with the toe.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.120
That's kind of weird.

00:30.129 --> 00:33.280
-Go.

00:30.129 --> 00:33.280
-Oh, yes!

00:33.289 --> 00:35.240
I got dizzy.

00:35.250 --> 00:39.060
Those aren't your abdominal

00:35.250 --> 00:39.060

00:39.070 --> 00:41.259
-We call it "fabs".

00:39.070 --> 00:41.259
-Maybe that's what I should do

00:43.130 --> 00:45.210

00:43.130 --> 00:45.210

00:45.219 --> 00:47.219

That thing is about

01:07.040 --> 01:09.060

"Hey, maybe now is really

05:03.100 --> 05:07.060

07:06.199 --> 07:09.060
That's the sharpest tip

07:06.199 --> 07:09.060
I've ever seen.

07:09.069 --> 07:11.060
-Oh, look at that.

07:09.069 --> 07:11.060
-That's not real.

07:11.069 --> 07:12.240
That's a Photoshop.

07:12.250 --> 07:15.279
That's just a piece of

07:12.250 --> 07:15.279
her cartilage left from her...

07:16.000 --> 07:18.110
one surgery

07:18.120 --> 07:21.089
and that thing is about

07:18.120 --> 07:21.089
to pop out through the skin.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.120
-Bring Holly in.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.120
-Can you please send in Holly?

07:25.160 --> 07:28.149
-Holly, nice to meet you.

07:25.160 --> 07:28.149
-Nice to meet you.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.060
When people look at me,

07:30.069 --> 07:32.100
the first thing I think

07:30.069 --> 07:32.100
is they're looking at my nose

07:32.110 --> 07:34.199
and what do they think? Like,

07:32.110 --> 07:34.199
do they think I'm a freak?

07:34.209 --> 07:39.019
I mean, I can be weird,

07:34.209 --> 07:39.019
but I'm not a freak.

07:40.050 --> 07:41.240
Nice to meet you.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.180
-Nice to meet you.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.180
-Nice to meet you guys.

07:43.189 --> 07:45.209
-Where are you guys from?

07:43.189 --> 07:45.209
-Houston.

07:45.220 --> 07:49.100
-I think we have a problem.

07:45.220 --> 07:49.100
-Yeah, my nose.

07:49.110 --> 07:52.250
Houston,

07:49.110 --> 07:52.250
we definitely have a problem.

07:52.259 --> 07:54.139
So, what happened?

07:54.149 --> 07:56.050
So when I was five or six,

07:56.060 --> 07:58.170
I broke my nose and once

07:56.060 --> 07:58.170
I hit my 30s,

07:58.180 --> 08:00.250
I got engaged, had surgery.

08:00.259 --> 08:02.139
How long ago was this, roughly?

08:02.149 --> 08:04.000
This was five years ago.

08:04.009 --> 08:05.250
And I guess when

08:04.009 --> 08:05.250
the doctor came out of surgery,

08:05.259 --> 08:07.220
he's like,

08:05.259 --> 08:07.220
"Oh, the surgery went great."

08:07.230 --> 08:09.100
He's like,

08:07.230 --> 08:09.100
"I pulverized her nose."

08:09.110 --> 08:11.250
-Pulverized?!

08:09.110 --> 08:11.250
-Pulverize means to destroy.

08:11.259 --> 08:14.180
Bottom of the list

08:11.259 --> 08:14.180
of things you want to hear

08:14.189 --> 08:16.060
postoperatively. Huh.

08:16.069 --> 08:18.040
Is it just me or...

08:18.050 --> 08:22.279
is pulverize a bad thing

08:18.050 --> 08:22.279
to say postoperatively?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
And this guy's a real plastic

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
surgeon for sure, right?

08:25.009 --> 08:28.060
Yeah, right. Yeah. Double board

08:25.009 --> 08:28.060
certified, like, ENT and...

08:28.069 --> 08:31.019
Facial.

08:28.069 --> 08:31.019
So he has my training.

08:31.029 --> 08:33.009
Yeah.

08:33.019 --> 08:34.230
Uh oh.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.159
So now, the cast comes off

08:39.169 --> 08:41.049
and then what happened?

08:41.059 --> 08:43.279
I remember seeing her

08:41.059 --> 08:43.279
after her surgery

08:43.289 --> 08:45.200
and her nose looked amazing.

08:45.210 --> 08:47.240
Then the next time I saw her,

08:45.210 --> 08:47.240
I was like,

08:47.250 --> 08:49.129
"Oh, it looks

08:47.250 --> 08:49.129
a little different."

08:49.139 --> 08:51.240
And then, you know,

08:49.139 --> 08:51.240
just kept getting sharper

08:51.250 --> 08:53.240
and pointier at the end,

08:51.250 --> 08:53.240
like a ski slope.

08:53.250 --> 08:56.090
And were you married

08:53.250 --> 08:56.090
at that time or what?

08:56.100 --> 08:57.289
I got married well after

08:58.000 --> 09:00.129
because my nose

08:58.000 --> 09:00.129
started changing so much.

09:00.139 --> 09:02.200
And finally it was, like,

09:00.139 --> 09:02.200
we were engaged five years

09:02.210 --> 09:04.149
and I was like,

09:02.210 --> 09:04.149
"It's time to get married."

09:04.159 --> 09:06.139
So you delayed getting married

09:06.149 --> 09:08.240
because of the way

09:06.149 --> 09:08.240
your nose looked?

09:08.250 --> 09:11.129
Yeah. I mean, I feel like it

09:08.250 --> 09:11.129
looks like my nose got slammed

09:11.139 --> 09:13.110
in the door and then

09:11.139 --> 09:13.110
it just stayed that way.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.000
Yeah. That's called

09:13.120 --> 09:15.000
shrink wrappage.

09:15.009 --> 09:17.220
Basically,

09:15.009 --> 09:17.220
it refers to the skin

09:17.230 --> 09:22.059
on the nose healing tightly

09:17.230 --> 09:22.059
around the existing anatomy,

09:22.070 --> 09:23.240
the cartilage

09:22.070 --> 09:23.240
and in Holly's case,

09:23.250 --> 09:26.039
if this continues to go on

09:23.250 --> 09:26.039
in the next few months,

09:26.049 --> 09:29.139
you never know. The actual

09:26.049 --> 09:29.139
tip cartilage can pop through

09:29.149 --> 09:31.080
the skin,

09:29.149 --> 09:31.080
break through the skin,

09:31.090 --> 09:32.250
and then there's

09:31.090 --> 09:32.250
always the risk

09:32.259 --> 09:34.200
of her losing

09:32.259 --> 09:34.200
her entire tip cartilage.

09:34.210 --> 09:36.240
Now, I assume

09:34.210 --> 09:36.240
you went back to that doctor

09:36.250 --> 09:38.110
when you noticed this.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.289
-No.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.289
-No?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.039
He messed up

09:40.000 --> 09:42.039
my nose so bad, like,

09:42.049 --> 09:44.000
why would I go

09:42.049 --> 09:44.000
back to this person?

09:44.009 --> 09:46.049
I'm sure you have a list

09:44.009 --> 09:46.049
of things you want fixed.

09:46.059 --> 09:49.019
Just to kind of have

09:46.059 --> 09:49.019
a straight nose,

09:49.029 --> 09:51.159
being able to breathe

09:49.029 --> 09:51.159
and kind of just, like,

09:51.169 --> 09:55.070
a normal looking tip,

09:51.169 --> 09:55.070
if that's possible.

09:55.240 --> 09:58.009
You know,

09:55.240 --> 09:58.009
I do have to say, I mean,

09:58.019 --> 10:00.090
I'm worried about your nose.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.159
When Dr. Dubrow and I looked

10:00.100 --> 10:03.159
at your photos, we said,

10:03.169 --> 10:05.179
"What the heck happened?"

10:05.190 --> 10:07.210
When we see a nose like yours,

10:05.190 --> 10:07.210
we usually think

10:07.220 --> 10:09.250
that maybe you had

10:07.220 --> 10:09.250
seven or eight surgeries.

10:09.259 --> 10:12.120
Yeah, that would make sense.

10:12.129 --> 10:14.149
You're at that point

10:12.129 --> 10:14.149
where you have

10:14.159 --> 10:16.240
a completely overdone nose.

10:16.250 --> 10:19.169
Never, never, ever seen

10:16.250 --> 10:19.169
a nose look like yours

10:19.179 --> 10:22.100
after one surgery

10:19.179 --> 10:22.100
that pointed.

10:22.110 --> 10:25.279
We would love to do

10:22.110 --> 10:25.279
anything we can to help you,

10:25.289 --> 10:29.149
but when it comes to

10:25.289 --> 10:29.149
a nose like yours, it's hard.

10:31.289 --> 10:33.240
He's going to add

10:31.289 --> 10:33.240
a lot of tissue,

10:33.250 --> 10:35.139
pack in the suitcase, right,

10:35.149 --> 10:37.049
puts more pressure

10:35.149 --> 10:37.049
on the skin.

10:37.059 --> 10:39.110
You're at super

10:37.059 --> 10:39.110
high risk for skin death.

10:40.169 --> 10:43.250
Right now, my armpits look

10:40.169 --> 10:43.250
like I need a bra for them.

10:43.259 --> 10:46.210
-Look at that.

10:43.259 --> 10:46.210
-That fat or is that a tumor?

10:46.220 --> 10:48.110
Right. What is it?

11:10.169 --> 11:13.009
and just sigh

11:16.019 --> 11:17.230
To see Paul react like that,

11:17.240 --> 11:20.149
knowing that he does

11:17.240 --> 11:20.149
the hardest nasal surgeries

11:20.159 --> 11:23.049
in the world

11:20.159 --> 11:23.049
tells you something.

11:23.059 --> 11:26.009
Holly's case is truly something

11:26.019 --> 11:27.210
we've never seen before.

11:27.220 --> 11:30.210
All right. So

11:27.220 --> 11:30.210
let's talk about this, okay?

11:30.220 --> 11:33.059
Go like this for me.

11:33.070 --> 11:36.220
Okay, so there's a gap in

11:33.070 --> 11:36.220
your nasal bones right here.

11:36.230 --> 11:38.220
It's called

11:36.230 --> 11:38.220
an open roof deformity

11:38.230 --> 11:40.220
and there's

11:38.230 --> 11:40.220
two ridges of bones.

11:40.230 --> 11:42.279
I take cartilage and I have

11:40.230 --> 11:42.279
this glue like material

11:43.000 --> 11:45.230
and I might be able to even

11:43.000 --> 11:45.230
just fill in that little gap.

11:45.240 --> 11:48.129
The middle third,

11:45.240 --> 11:48.129
we have to add cartilage again,

11:48.139 --> 11:50.009
called spreader grafts.

11:50.019 --> 11:52.019
The third part of this is

11:52.029 --> 11:54.159
going to be the tip.

11:55.009 --> 11:57.200
So you,

11:55.009 --> 11:57.200
from what it appears to me,

11:57.210 --> 11:59.159
don't have

11:57.210 --> 11:59.159
usable tip cartilage.

11:59.169 --> 12:01.080
Okay.

12:01.090 --> 12:04.110
I would have to cut out

12:01.090 --> 12:04.110
all your natural tip cartilage

12:04.120 --> 12:06.230
and take new cartilage

12:04.120 --> 12:06.230
and make you a tip.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.120
Wow.

12:08.129 --> 12:11.190
Here is my dilemma and

12:08.129 --> 12:11.190
one thing I'm worried about.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.049
He usually

12:12.000 --> 12:14.049
doesn't hear me say this.

12:14.059 --> 12:17.110
I'm worried about how

12:14.059 --> 12:17.110
your nose is going to turn out,

12:17.120 --> 12:20.190
but the nasal skin is really,

12:17.120 --> 12:20.190
really, really thin.

12:20.200 --> 12:24.190
He's going to add a lot

12:20.200 --> 12:24.190
of tissue, which, you know,

12:24.200 --> 12:26.100
is packing the suitcase, right?

12:26.110 --> 12:27.279
Puts more pressure on the skin.

12:27.289 --> 12:29.230
and when you

12:27.289 --> 12:29.230
zip up the suitcase,

12:29.240 --> 12:31.230
except he's going

12:29.240 --> 12:31.230
to put stitches in

12:31.240 --> 12:35.009
and you're at super high risk

12:31.240 --> 12:35.009
for a blood supply problem.

12:35.019 --> 12:37.139
Necrosis, skin death.

12:38.210 --> 12:40.220
Well, you know, if you open up

12:40.230 --> 12:43.139
a high risk

12:40.230 --> 12:43.139
rhinoplasty textbook,

12:43.149 --> 12:46.110
you won't even find

12:43.149 --> 12:46.110
cases this difficult in there.

12:48.049 --> 12:50.059
What's going through your head?

12:50.070 --> 12:52.000
Scared, nervous.

12:53.070 --> 12:54.159
Definitely.

12:54.169 --> 12:56.230
There's not even

12:54.169 --> 12:56.230
a case in in a textbook

12:56.240 --> 13:00.049
like my nose.

12:56.240 --> 13:00.049
That really brings...

13:00.059 --> 13:02.169
to light the way that

13:00.059 --> 13:02.169
I've been feeling, like,

13:02.179 --> 13:04.149
I know that I'm just not crazy.

13:04.159 --> 13:07.179
I know that I'm just not

13:04.159 --> 13:07.179
being just so insecure.

13:07.190 --> 13:10.190
It really, it really is bad.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.149
I want to do it.

13:54.059 --> 13:57.230
filled with something

13:57.240 --> 14:00.019
the size

13:57.240 --> 14:00.019
of a half of a softball.

14:00.029 --> 14:03.230
Right now, my armpits look

14:00.029 --> 14:03.230
like I need a bra for them.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.230
[laughing]

14:05.240 --> 14:07.179
Possibly freaking a B cup.

14:07.190 --> 14:10.019
Ready? One, two, three.

14:07.190 --> 14:10.019
Run that way.

14:10.029 --> 14:11.169
Run, run!

14:11.179 --> 14:13.100
When I got pregnant

14:11.179 --> 14:13.100
with my daughter Kendall.

14:13.110 --> 14:16.190
I had this growth

14:13.110 --> 14:16.190
and I had no idea what it was.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.259
When I was breastfeeding,

14:18.269 --> 14:21.169
I actually had milk

14:18.269 --> 14:21.169
leaking out of my armpit

14:21.179 --> 14:24.289
and milk would leak

14:21.179 --> 14:24.289
from just my pores.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.269
Like, where does it come from?

14:26.279 --> 14:28.190
It's like real red already.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.269
They are starting to

14:28.200 --> 14:30.269
hurt right here a little bit.

14:30.279 --> 14:33.090
When my armpits get really bad,

14:30.279 --> 14:33.090
they're sore.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.070
They're tender to the touch.

14:35.080 --> 14:39.190
I have to put oil and ointment

14:35.080 --> 14:39.190
because they actually rub raw.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.149
It's embarrassing.

14:41.159 --> 14:44.039
I feel really uncomfortable

14:41.159 --> 14:44.039
in a tank top.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.000
Is there anybody looking at me?

14:46.009 --> 14:47.129
No.

14:47.139 --> 14:49.049
It just looks so painful

14:49.059 --> 14:51.139
and it's something

14:49.059 --> 14:51.139
I would just not wish

14:51.149 --> 14:53.100
on my worst enemy

14:51.149 --> 14:53.100
to have to deal with.

14:53.110 --> 14:55.070
Daddy doesn't even

14:53.110 --> 14:55.070
like to talk about it

14:55.080 --> 14:57.149
because he knows

14:55.080 --> 14:57.149
how much it bothers mama.

14:57.159 --> 14:59.070
Gives daddy the heebie jeebies.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.139
I've seen seven doctors total.

15:01.149 --> 15:04.230
One doctor told me that

15:01.149 --> 15:04.230
it's breast tissue, basically,

15:04.240 --> 15:06.230
like, you're stuck with them.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.279
There's nothing

15:06.240 --> 15:08.279
I can do with you.

15:08.289 --> 15:10.149
So I don't know.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.000
Can this be fixed

15:12.009 --> 15:14.159
and or will I always have

15:12.009 --> 15:14.159
breasts in my armpits?

15:16.210 --> 15:19.110
You know, sometimes

15:16.210 --> 15:19.110
patients have problems because

15:19.120 --> 15:21.059
the surgery went bad?

15:21.070 --> 15:24.190
And then other times

15:21.070 --> 15:24.190
it's when nature goes bad?

15:24.200 --> 15:27.220
Let me show you

15:24.200 --> 15:27.220
how nature went bad here.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.169
Look at that.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.259
She's never had surgery.

15:31.269 --> 15:33.190
Can you wrap

15:31.269 --> 15:33.190
your brain around that?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.220
-That fat or is that a tumor?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.220
-Right. What is it?

15:35.230 --> 15:38.019
Can you please

15:35.230 --> 15:38.019
send in Samantha?

15:39.149 --> 15:41.059
-Samantha.

15:39.149 --> 15:41.059
-Hello.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.059
Hi. Nice to meet you.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.059
Samantha.

15:43.070 --> 15:44.200
Terry Dubrow. Pleasure.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.190
-Nice to meet you.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.190
-Frankie.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.230
You brought the husband.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.230
You brought the ball and chain.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.169
I thought

15:48.240 --> 15:50.169
I would bring him along.

15:50.179 --> 15:52.049
Why not?

15:52.059 --> 15:54.200
How long have you had

15:52.059 --> 15:54.200
these masses in your armpits?

15:54.210 --> 15:57.200
It started with

15:54.210 --> 15:57.200
the pregnancy of my daughter.

15:57.210 --> 15:59.009
Of my first child.

15:59.019 --> 16:01.049
-Nothing before.

15:59.019 --> 16:01.049
-Nothing before that.

16:01.059 --> 16:02.220
And I got pregnant with my son

16:02.230 --> 16:05.100
when my daughter

16:02.230 --> 16:05.100
was only about six months old.

16:05.110 --> 16:06.220
So what happened

16:05.110 --> 16:06.220
with the second one?

16:06.230 --> 16:09.110
-Worse.

16:06.230 --> 16:09.110
-Worse? It got bigger.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.210
Yes, I had milk leaking from...

16:11.220 --> 16:14.059
Milk's leaking

16:11.220 --> 16:14.059
from the armpit area.

16:14.070 --> 16:15.139
Right.

16:15.149 --> 16:17.039
Are you finished

16:15.149 --> 16:17.039
having children?

16:17.049 --> 16:19.000
Yes, we're done.

16:19.009 --> 16:21.049
Okay, pull your hair away

16:19.009 --> 16:21.049
a little bit for a second.

16:21.059 --> 16:22.250
There you go.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.039
Your thyroid's

16:24.149 --> 16:26.039
a little swollen.

16:26.049 --> 16:27.230
Oh, is it?

16:27.240 --> 16:29.210
Yeah, I know that's

16:27.240 --> 16:29.210
not what you're here for.

16:29.220 --> 16:31.139
I just wanted

16:29.220 --> 16:31.139
to mention that to you.

16:31.149 --> 16:33.049
Despite the way he looks,

16:33.059 --> 16:37.039
Paul is actually a really

16:33.059 --> 16:37.039
smart, astute clinician

16:37.049 --> 16:39.210
And that pick up

16:37.049 --> 16:39.210
of the thyroid

16:39.220 --> 16:42.220
is an important part

16:39.220 --> 16:42.220
of Samantha's assessment

16:42.230 --> 16:45.039
and potential future treatment.

16:45.049 --> 16:47.220
There's a gland in your brain

16:45.049 --> 16:47.220
called the pituitary gland,

16:47.230 --> 16:51.129
and the front part contains

16:47.230 --> 16:51.129
similar hormones

16:51.139 --> 16:54.080
that can enlarge this,

16:51.139 --> 16:54.080
can enlarge this,

16:54.090 --> 16:56.200
that can give you

16:54.090 --> 16:56.200
other endocrine problems.

16:56.210 --> 17:00.009
The thing with Samantha

16:56.210 --> 17:00.009
is that we need to

17:00.019 --> 17:01.230
resolve any issues

17:01.240 --> 17:03.200
with her thyroid

17:01.240 --> 17:03.200
before surgery.

17:03.210 --> 17:06.150
Number one is because

17:03.210 --> 17:06.150
she's having anesthesia.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.289
We got to make sure her thyroid

17:08.000 --> 17:09.230
is on point and working well.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.089
Two, could there be

17:09.240 --> 17:12.089
any relationship

17:12.099 --> 17:15.220
with thyroid malfunction

17:12.099 --> 17:15.220
and the armpit masses?

17:15.230 --> 17:17.079
We don't know.

17:17.089 --> 17:19.109
-Can you ever wear a tank top?

17:17.089 --> 17:19.109
-Never.

17:19.119 --> 17:21.039
-Can you wear a bikini top?

17:19.119 --> 17:21.039
-No.

17:21.049 --> 17:23.230
How's it affected

17:21.049 --> 17:23.230
your situation, if at all?

17:23.240 --> 17:27.170
It transfers over

17:23.240 --> 17:27.170
to our romantic life.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.140
Because you're

17:27.180 --> 17:29.140
self-conscious about it?

17:29.150 --> 17:31.170
-Yeah.

17:29.150 --> 17:31.170
-And she goes to sleep

17:31.180 --> 17:33.210
with something

17:31.180 --> 17:33.210
covering now, you know,

17:33.220 --> 17:38.109
so it's a 24/7 thing. It's

17:33.220 --> 17:38.109
an obstacle for her every day.

17:38.119 --> 17:41.190
It's been really hard to

17:38.119 --> 17:41.190
watch Samantha go through this

17:41.200 --> 17:43.220
situation for all these years.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.049
When we got married,

17:45.059 --> 17:46.220
Samantha wasn't

17:45.059 --> 17:46.220
even able to wear

17:46.230 --> 17:49.049
the wedding dress

17:46.230 --> 17:49.049
of her dreams because

17:49.059 --> 17:52.009
it's a sleeveless dress

17:49.059 --> 17:52.009
that revealed everything,

17:52.019 --> 17:53.210
her armpit.

17:53.220 --> 17:56.059
I hope that maybe one day,

17:53.220 --> 17:56.059
she would be able to wear

17:56.069 --> 17:58.220
her dress that

17:56.069 --> 17:58.220
she's always wanted to wear.

17:58.230 --> 18:00.150
So the question, is it...

18:00.160 --> 18:03.140
an abnormal problem

18:03.150 --> 18:07.099
that has a disease

18:03.150 --> 18:07.099
potentially associated with it,

18:07.109 --> 18:09.230
or is it just

18:07.109 --> 18:09.230
an anatomical variant

18:09.240 --> 18:12.210
that's giving you cosmetic

18:09.240 --> 18:12.210
and functional problems

18:12.220 --> 18:15.059
that you just need to remove?

18:15.069 --> 18:16.210
That's the big question.

18:18.119 --> 18:21.210
I wear a business suit

18:18.119 --> 18:21.210
to work every day,

18:21.220 --> 18:23.279
These are so cute.

18:23.289 --> 18:26.079
And nobody knows what

18:23.289 --> 18:26.079
I'm wearing underneath it.

18:26.089 --> 18:29.109
It makes me feel

18:26.089 --> 18:29.109
so sexy and confident,

18:29.119 --> 18:30.279
[laughing]

18:30.289 --> 18:33.170
A little small tear

18:30.289 --> 18:33.170
in the skin.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.230
Her skin is wafer thin.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.130
Oh, boy.

18:41.130 --> 18:44.000
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

18:44.009 --> 18:47.200
[dramatic music]

18:47.210 --> 18:50.220
You have clearly

18:47.210 --> 18:50.220
an enlarged thyroid.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.210
It's a big one, huh.

18:52.220 --> 18:55.079
Put your feet that way

18:52.220 --> 18:55.079
for me just for a minute, okay?

18:55.089 --> 18:56.210
Just wanna feel it.

18:56.220 --> 18:59.279
Okay, do me one favor

18:56.220 --> 18:59.279
and swallow for me.

18:59.289 --> 19:02.069
I'm nervous. I'm scared.

19:02.079 --> 19:05.079
It has my mind going,

19:02.079 --> 19:05.079
racing a mile a minute.

19:05.089 --> 19:07.069
Is there something else going

19:07.079 --> 19:09.160
on that is connected

19:07.079 --> 19:09.160
to my thyroid?

19:09.170 --> 19:12.009
So, lift your arm up for a sec.

19:12.019 --> 19:14.099
Wow. So very irritated.

19:14.109 --> 19:16.170
Feel that, Paul.

19:16.180 --> 19:18.059
Let me see this one.

19:19.089 --> 19:20.220
Very soft.

19:20.230 --> 19:22.210
Yeah, that feels

19:20.230 --> 19:22.210
just like a breast tissue.

19:22.220 --> 19:24.170
This one's a lot bigger.

19:24.180 --> 19:26.200
This one is a little scary.

19:26.210 --> 19:28.009
Huge.

19:28.019 --> 19:30.109
Okay, let's talk about this.

19:30.119 --> 19:33.079
So the question is,

19:30.119 --> 19:33.079
is this part of

19:33.089 --> 19:35.150
a larger symptom complex

19:33.089 --> 19:35.150
with your thyroid?

19:35.160 --> 19:39.019
The answer, I think, lies in

19:35.160 --> 19:39.019
a series of simple blood tests.

19:39.029 --> 19:41.210
Let's assume

19:39.029 --> 19:41.210
for this discussion,

19:41.220 --> 19:44.220
these are

19:41.220 --> 19:44.220
isolated anatomic features.

19:44.230 --> 19:46.109
What are they? What is this?

19:46.119 --> 19:49.079
This is called

19:46.119 --> 19:49.079
ectopic axillary tissue.

19:49.089 --> 19:52.150
It's essentially

19:49.089 --> 19:52.150
enlarged breasts

19:52.160 --> 19:55.190
at the tail

19:52.160 --> 19:55.190
of the breast tissue.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.170
Every girl has breasts

19:57.180 --> 20:02.109
and then a small tail

19:57.180 --> 20:02.109
that leads into the armpit.

20:02.119 --> 20:04.160
Rarely during pregnancy,

20:04.170 --> 20:06.049
it can enlarge temporarily

20:06.059 --> 20:08.059
and then it almost always

20:06.059 --> 20:08.059
resolves after that.

20:08.069 --> 20:10.059
For some reason,

20:08.069 --> 20:10.059
yours persisted,

20:10.069 --> 20:11.210
Right.

20:11.220 --> 20:13.220
I've never seen

20:11.220 --> 20:13.220
this big a persistence.

20:13.230 --> 20:18.119
Let me tell you what's

20:13.230 --> 20:18.119
complicated about your case.

20:18.130 --> 20:22.009
The armpit is what we call

20:18.130 --> 20:22.009
"Tiger Country".

20:23.039 --> 20:26.200
"Tiger Country" is an

20:23.039 --> 20:26.200
expression we use in surgery,

20:26.210 --> 20:30.150
that means if you

20:26.210 --> 20:30.150
dissect in an area,

20:30.160 --> 20:34.049
there are things you can see

20:30.160 --> 20:34.049
and things you cannot see.

20:34.059 --> 20:36.210
For example, there's the

20:34.059 --> 20:36.210
lymphatics, the lymph nodes,

20:36.220 --> 20:40.049
and those are microscopic.

20:36.220 --> 20:40.049
You can't really see them

20:40.059 --> 20:42.160
and if you get into them

20:40.059 --> 20:42.160
and you disrupt them,

20:42.170 --> 20:44.079
it can lead to a chronic,

20:44.089 --> 20:46.109
potentially

20:44.089 --> 20:46.109
debilitating problem.

20:50.119 --> 20:55.089

21:00.230 --> 21:05.119

21:14.089 --> 21:16.079

21:16.089 --> 21:19.220

because you can't suction out

21:19.230 --> 21:22.269
breast gland tissue

21:22.279 --> 21:25.059
and whatever's left,

21:22.279 --> 21:25.059

27:42.089 --> 27:44.250
slowly peel that off

27:44.259 --> 27:47.009
because you have

27:44.259 --> 27:47.009
stitches right underneath it.

27:47.019 --> 27:49.200
So obviously

27:47.019 --> 27:49.200
the reason why we got leeches,

27:49.210 --> 27:53.109
your tip was purple.

27:49.210 --> 27:53.109
Now, it's pink.

27:53.119 --> 27:55.089
Leeches helped that.

27:53.119 --> 27:55.089
Great.

27:55.099 --> 27:57.109
I'm excited to see the result.

27:57.119 --> 28:00.170
Well, so am I.

27:57.119 --> 28:00.170
I actually on the table,

28:00.180 --> 28:02.029
did a fantastic job.

28:02.039 --> 28:06.069
-Of course you did.

28:02.039 --> 28:06.069
-Congratulate yourself.

28:06.220 --> 28:08.109
I didn't pulverize your nose.

28:08.119 --> 28:11.089
I actually kissed it

28:08.119 --> 28:11.089
with tender love and care.

28:11.099 --> 28:12.289
Don't get him started.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.259
Next, he'll tell you

28:13.000 --> 28:14.259
how good looking he is.

28:14.269 --> 28:16.150
-I am.

28:14.269 --> 28:16.150
-He is good looking.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.200
But no matter

28:16.160 --> 28:18.200
how good it looks now,

28:18.210 --> 28:23.000
we're going to have to wait to

28:18.210 --> 28:23.000
see how you're going to heal.

28:23.009 --> 28:26.200
Nose, do what you're

28:23.009 --> 28:26.200
supposed to do. Be a good girl.

28:26.210 --> 28:30.109
Don't make me get

28:26.210 --> 28:30.109
leeches back on you.

28:30.119 --> 28:32.259
Don't be pointy,

28:30.119 --> 28:32.259
don't be pointy, bitch.

28:32.269 --> 28:35.210
-Pleasure.

28:32.269 --> 28:35.210
-Nice to see you guys.

28:35.220 --> 28:38.069
-Congratulations.

28:35.220 --> 28:38.069
-Thank you so much.

28:43.029 --> 28:47.109
You identify what this

28:43.029 --> 28:47.109
patient's main concern is,

28:47.119 --> 28:50.089
looking at her breasts.

28:47.119 --> 28:50.089
So her name is Monica.

28:50.099 --> 28:52.130
What's going on

28:50.099 --> 28:52.130
with the areolas?

28:52.140 --> 28:56.000
Exactly.

28:52.140 --> 28:56.000
They're really close.

28:56.009 --> 28:58.000
So why don't we see

28:56.009 --> 28:58.000
if we can help her?

28:58.009 --> 28:59.049
Yeah, we can do that.

28:59.059 --> 29:01.160
Can you please send in Monica?

29:01.170 --> 29:03.089
-Monica.

29:01.170 --> 29:03.089
-Nice to meet you.

29:03.099 --> 29:05.069
-Nice to meet you.

29:03.099 --> 29:05.069
-Hello, I'm Annah.

29:05.079 --> 29:06.269
So, welcome.

29:06.279 --> 29:09.069
Let me ask you,

29:06.279 --> 29:09.069
what do you do for a living?

29:09.079 --> 29:10.269
I'm an attorney.

29:10.279 --> 29:12.150
-An attorney?

29:10.279 --> 29:12.150
-Yeah.

29:12.160 --> 29:15.009
What kind of law

29:12.160 --> 29:15.009
do you practice?

29:15.019 --> 29:16.170
-Family law.

29:15.019 --> 29:16.170
-So, not medical malpractice.

29:16.180 --> 29:19.009
-No.

29:16.180 --> 29:19.009
-Okay, good. Welcome.

29:19.019 --> 29:21.109
But family,

29:19.019 --> 29:21.109
all the divorce stuff.

29:21.119 --> 29:24.130
Monica does not have

29:21.119 --> 29:24.130
the typical appearance

29:24.140 --> 29:26.200
of a family law attorney.

29:26.210 --> 29:30.029
And believe me, I know what

29:26.210 --> 29:30.029
family law attorneys look like.

29:31.220 --> 29:36.059
So you have

29:31.220 --> 29:36.059
an interesting kind of look.

29:36.069 --> 29:38.000
What is your background?

29:38.009 --> 29:39.200
So, I go by, like,

29:38.009 --> 29:39.200
the Chi-talian doll.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.019
I'm half Chinese

29:39.210 --> 29:41.019
and half Italian.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.109
Chi-talian.

29:42.119 --> 29:43.210
Chi-talian. I know.

29:43.220 --> 29:45.259
By the way,

29:43.220 --> 29:45.259
Chinese and Italian,

29:45.269 --> 29:48.130
two of the best

29:45.269 --> 29:48.130
cuisines in history.

29:48.140 --> 29:50.160
It all goes back to food again.

29:50.170 --> 29:54.009
Oh, yeah. You obviously,

29:50.170 --> 29:54.009
just based on the pictures,

29:54.019 --> 29:56.059
you've had some things done

29:54.019 --> 29:56.059
in the past.

29:56.069 --> 29:58.200
At 11 years old,

29:56.069 --> 29:58.200
I started stuffing my bra.

29:58.210 --> 30:00.140
I just really like that look.

30:00.150 --> 30:02.289
I loveed, like,

30:00.150 --> 30:02.289
the big boobs, small waist.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.210
And I got

30:03.000 --> 30:04.210
my first boob job at 19.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.140
All right.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.140
What size put in initially?

30:06.150 --> 30:09.049
-350s. A D.

30:06.150 --> 30:09.049
-All right.

30:09.059 --> 30:11.099
-That's a good size.

30:09.059 --> 30:11.099
-No, not to me.

30:11.109 --> 30:12.210
-No, not for her.

30:11.109 --> 30:12.210
-Oh, really?

30:12.220 --> 30:14.180
No, I'm pretty extreme.

30:14.190 --> 30:16.269
I went in with expectations

30:14.190 --> 30:16.269
of huge boobs. I was young.

30:16.279 --> 30:19.170
I didn't really know

30:16.279 --> 30:19.170
anything about plastic surgery.

30:19.180 --> 30:22.069
I was pretty extreme,

30:19.180 --> 30:22.069
like going boom, boom, boom,

30:22.079 --> 30:24.009
non-stop, like, with surgeries.

30:24.019 --> 30:27.089
And so I have had six boob jobs

30:24.019 --> 30:27.089
springing up to 1400 CCs.

30:27.099 --> 30:29.039
I woke up, I was like,

30:29.049 --> 30:30.200
"Man, this is what

30:29.049 --> 30:30.200
I've always wanted."

30:30.210 --> 30:32.150
After I started recovering,

30:32.160 --> 30:34.089
I started noticing like

30:32.160 --> 30:34.089
my nipples were more inwards

30:34.099 --> 30:35.289
as opposed to

30:34.099 --> 30:35.289
the center of the breast.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.009
I have a lot of side boob.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.009
I like side boob.

30:38.019 --> 30:40.009
I just want my nipples

30:38.019 --> 30:40.009
to be more centered.

30:40.019 --> 30:42.160
What were your breasts like

30:40.019 --> 30:42.160
before you had that?

30:42.170 --> 30:44.119
Were your areolas small?

30:44.130 --> 30:46.069
Yeah. I mean,

30:44.130 --> 30:46.069
my areolas are the same size

30:46.079 --> 30:48.009
-as they are now.

30:46.079 --> 30:48.009
-They haven't stretched it all.

30:48.019 --> 30:50.160
They haven't stretched, no.

30:50.170 --> 30:52.079
Normally when you expand

30:50.170 --> 30:52.079
breast tissue a lot,

30:52.089 --> 30:54.210
the areolas expand

30:52.089 --> 30:54.210
with it proportionally.

30:54.220 --> 30:57.109
But sometimes,

30:54.220 --> 30:57.109
there's a difference between

30:57.119 --> 31:00.279
the amount of elastic fibers

30:57.119 --> 31:00.279
within the areola

31:00.289 --> 31:03.039
and the immediately

31:00.289 --> 31:03.039
adjacent skin,

31:03.049 --> 31:07.049
so the skin stretches

31:03.049 --> 31:07.049
much more than the areola does.

31:07.059 --> 31:09.049
I just always strive

31:07.059 --> 31:09.049
for perfection.

31:09.059 --> 31:11.009
So I just keep you know,

31:09.059 --> 31:11.009
I see something.

31:11.019 --> 31:12.160
I want to get it fixed.

31:12.170 --> 31:14.140
-What do you think?

31:12.170 --> 31:14.140
-She's a little extra.

31:14.150 --> 31:15.269
Extra is a good word.

31:15.279 --> 31:17.259
So why don't we

31:15.279 --> 31:17.259
go in the exam room

31:17.269 --> 31:20.160
and see whether we can help you

31:17.269 --> 31:20.160
or advise you properly.

31:20.170 --> 31:21.210
Sound good?

31:21.220 --> 31:23.180
-Sounds great.

31:21.220 --> 31:23.180
-Let's do it.

31:23.190 --> 31:27.279
Option one, try to close

31:23.190 --> 31:27.279
the pocket off on the sides,

31:27.289 --> 31:30.259
but you lose your side breast

31:27.289 --> 31:30.259
that you like.

31:30.269 --> 31:32.190
Oh my God, no.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.190
We're going into the jungle,

31:32.200 --> 31:34.190
ladies and gentlemen.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.039
There's a lymph node

31:34.200 --> 31:36.039
right there.

31:36.049 --> 31:37.210
I don't really want

31:36.049 --> 31:37.210
to be in there.

31:45.250 --> 31:48.009
♪about what they said? thin

31:48.019 --> 31:51.160
They know you're extra.

31:48.019 --> 31:51.160
Who doesn't?

31:51.170 --> 31:53.190
I'm excited for the surprise.

31:53.200 --> 31:57.200
-Gonna be shocked.

31:53.200 --> 31:57.200
-Like, super shocked.

31:57.210 --> 31:59.099
Hi!

32:01.099 --> 32:03.230
I promise to tell the truth,

32:01.099 --> 32:03.230
the whole truth,

32:03.240 --> 32:05.099
and nothing but the truth.

32:05.109 --> 32:06.279
-You get it?

32:05.109 --> 32:06.279
-I get it.

32:06.289 --> 32:09.019
Ladies and gentlemen

32:06.289 --> 32:09.019
of the jury,

32:09.029 --> 32:11.069
it's interesting

32:09.029 --> 32:11.069
because I've never,

32:11.079 --> 32:14.119
in my experience, encountered

32:11.079 --> 32:14.119
the nipples are too close.

32:14.130 --> 32:18.130
It's always nipples are

32:14.130 --> 32:18.130
too far or too high or too low.

32:18.140 --> 32:21.049
But in your case,

32:18.140 --> 32:21.049
interestingly...

32:21.059 --> 32:23.000
[cheering]

32:23.009 --> 32:25.259
We wanted to surprise you.

32:25.269 --> 32:27.259
Feels like we're back

32:25.269 --> 32:27.259
in Vegas again.

32:31.119 --> 32:32.259
So let's just do

32:31.119 --> 32:32.259
a general exam,

32:32.269 --> 32:34.200
if you were to do this,

32:34.210 --> 32:37.049
bring them this way,

32:34.210 --> 32:37.049
the areolas,

32:37.059 --> 32:39.009
they look further apart.

32:39.019 --> 32:41.200
Right?

32:39.019 --> 32:41.200
All right, so put this back

32:41.210 --> 32:43.150
and let's talk about options.

32:43.160 --> 32:47.109
Okay, option one, try to close

32:43.160 --> 32:47.109
the pocket off on the sides,

32:47.119 --> 32:50.079
forcing the areolas

32:47.119 --> 32:50.079
in the opposite direction.

32:50.089 --> 32:53.109
The problem with that

32:50.089 --> 32:53.109
is you're so tight now

32:53.119 --> 32:56.200
and even if we were to put a

32:53.119 --> 32:56.200
wall of some material in there,

32:56.210 --> 32:59.190
the chances it would stay

32:56.210 --> 32:59.190
and work is very, very low

32:59.200 --> 33:02.009
because the implants

32:59.200 --> 33:02.009
are really big,

33:02.019 --> 33:03.289
you'd have very straight edges

33:04.000 --> 33:06.009
and you'd lose your

33:04.000 --> 33:06.009
side breasts that you like.

33:06.019 --> 33:07.099
Oh, my God, no.

33:07.109 --> 33:08.259
I object.

33:10.059 --> 33:11.250
Not an option.

33:11.259 --> 33:15.150
Next option

33:11.259 --> 33:15.150
is to take these out,

33:15.160 --> 33:19.089
downsize them, bringing

33:15.160 --> 33:19.089
your areolas further this way.

33:19.099 --> 33:22.079
You'd still be very big.

33:19.099 --> 33:22.079
You wouldn't be 1400 CCs,

33:22.089 --> 33:26.000
but that's on the table

33:22.089 --> 33:26.000
as a possibility

33:26.009 --> 33:31.049
and not completely

33:26.009 --> 33:31.049
without risk, but safe-ish.

33:31.059 --> 33:32.200
Honestly, no,

33:32.210 --> 33:34.099
You don't even

33:32.210 --> 33:34.099
wanna think about this?

33:34.109 --> 33:36.049
You don't want

33:34.109 --> 33:36.049
to deliberate for a moment.

33:36.059 --> 33:38.009
You want to go back

33:36.059 --> 33:38.009
and discuss it

33:38.019 --> 33:39.200
with the jury foreman.

33:39.210 --> 33:41.170
Going smaller is not

33:39.210 --> 33:41.170
something I really wanna do.

33:41.180 --> 33:43.259
She wanted this for years.

33:43.269 --> 33:47.160
It's very clear

33:43.269 --> 33:47.160
all of my arguments were solid.

33:47.170 --> 33:51.009
I did not influence

33:47.170 --> 33:51.009
the members of the jury.

33:51.019 --> 33:53.190
I don't want to go smaller.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.039
Right now,

33:53.200 --> 33:55.039
they're a little close, but--

33:55.049 --> 33:57.069
They're not bad.

33:57.079 --> 33:59.240
Yeah, it's just

33:57.079 --> 33:59.240
not what I want to do

33:59.250 --> 34:02.079
and I'm taking my tassels

33:59.250 --> 34:02.079
and I'm taking my breasts

34:02.089 --> 34:04.049
and case closed.

34:05.009 --> 34:08.280
It's a great pleasure meeting

34:05.009 --> 34:08.280
you guys. Thank you so much.

34:14.210 --> 34:16.050
-Samantha.

34:14.210 --> 34:16.050
-Hello.

34:16.059 --> 34:17.199
-Hello, how are you?

34:16.059 --> 34:17.199
-I'm excited.

34:17.210 --> 34:19.179
You are? Good. Me too.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.260
So, I was just looking

34:19.190 --> 34:21.260
at your lab tests.

34:21.269 --> 34:25.130
Your endocrine workup,

34:21.269 --> 34:25.130
fortunately, negative.

34:25.139 --> 34:28.119
The fact that Samantha's

34:25.139 --> 34:28.119
thyroid workup is negative

34:28.130 --> 34:31.280
means the problem in her

34:28.130 --> 34:31.280
armpits is an isolated problem

34:31.289 --> 34:36.090
and she doesn't actually have

34:31.289 --> 34:36.090
any issues with her thyroid.

34:36.099 --> 34:39.099
We can therefore go

34:36.099 --> 34:39.099
into surgery with confidence,

34:39.110 --> 34:41.170
knowing that

34:39.110 --> 34:41.170
the masses in her armpits

34:41.179 --> 34:43.099
will not grow back again.

34:43.110 --> 34:44.199
-Ready for this?

34:43.110 --> 34:44.199
-I'm ready.

34:44.210 --> 34:46.099
-Feel good about it?

34:44.210 --> 34:46.099
-Yup, I do.

34:46.110 --> 34:47.269
That makes one.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.260
Yeah, I'll let

34:47.280 --> 34:49.260
you know in an hour.

34:49.269 --> 34:51.219
-Let me know.

34:49.269 --> 34:51.219
-All right.

34:56.210 --> 34:58.110
Today for Samantha's surgery,

34:58.119 --> 35:01.019
my plan is to make

34:58.119 --> 35:01.019
small incisions in each armpit

35:01.030 --> 35:04.039
and begin with liposuction

35:01.030 --> 35:04.039
to see how much of the masses

35:04.050 --> 35:05.170
I can remove.

35:05.179 --> 35:07.239
Next, I will make

35:05.179 --> 35:07.239
bigger incisions to go into

35:07.250 --> 35:10.150
the axilla and dissect out

35:07.250 --> 35:10.150
the remaining tissue,

35:10.159 --> 35:13.199
leaving Samantha with

35:10.159 --> 35:13.199
normal appearing armpits.

35:13.210 --> 35:17.050
Okay, so we'll start

35:13.210 --> 35:17.050
with some liposuction.

35:19.019 --> 35:21.159
It already feels

35:19.019 --> 35:21.159
very glandular.

35:21.170 --> 35:23.110
It's not suctioning at all.

35:23.119 --> 35:25.110
Okay.

35:25.119 --> 35:27.260
Big fat zero.

35:25.119 --> 35:27.260
So it's all breast tissue.

35:27.269 --> 35:32.170
Well, I was hoping it wouldn't

35:27.269 --> 35:32.170
be that, but it is. All right.

35:32.179 --> 35:34.190
So let's go ahead

35:32.179 --> 35:34.190
and start the dissection.

35:34.199 --> 35:37.050
We're going into the jungle,

35:34.199 --> 35:37.050
ladies and gentlemen.

35:37.059 --> 35:41.130
The whole goal is to get as

35:37.059 --> 35:41.130
much of the breast tissue out

35:41.139 --> 35:45.039
as possible without

35:41.139 --> 35:45.039
damaging the lymphatics

35:45.050 --> 35:47.010
or any of

35:45.050 --> 35:47.010
the vascular structures.

35:47.019 --> 35:50.260
Okay, now comes the scary part.

35:47.019 --> 35:50.260
On this side, the hardest part.

35:50.269 --> 35:54.000
The problem is,

35:50.269 --> 35:54.000
it's not like they're labeled

35:54.010 --> 35:56.269
and you can say,

35:54.010 --> 35:56.269
"Avoid me here."

35:56.280 --> 36:00.010
You have to actually

35:56.280 --> 36:00.010
carefully dissect away

36:00.019 --> 36:02.199
and determine how close

36:00.019 --> 36:02.199
you're getting to them,

36:02.210 --> 36:05.059
Holy shi--.

36:02.210 --> 36:05.059
This thing is huge.

36:05.070 --> 36:07.170
There's a lymph node

36:05.070 --> 36:07.170
right there.

36:07.179 --> 36:09.170
I don't really want

36:07.179 --> 36:09.170
to be in that, you know,

36:09.179 --> 36:11.250
Yeah, this goes

36:09.179 --> 36:11.250
right deep into the jungle.

36:11.260 --> 36:14.079
This thing

36:11.260 --> 36:14.079
is not fooling around.

36:14.090 --> 36:16.110
Oh, look at that.

36:16.119 --> 36:20.139
Oh, boy. What is that?

36:16.119 --> 36:20.139
Okay. Big blood vessel.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.239
Look, there's a little

36:21.179 --> 36:23.239
lymph node right there,

36:23.250 --> 36:25.199
I don't really want

36:23.250 --> 36:25.199
to go any deeper this.

36:25.210 --> 36:29.230
This is a good,

36:25.210 --> 36:29.230
safe little cushion, right?

36:29.239 --> 36:32.170
Okay, that--

36:32.179 --> 36:34.199
it's all this breast tissue

36:32.179 --> 36:34.199
that extends

36:34.210 --> 36:36.130
right into the armpit.

36:36.139 --> 36:38.110
Look at this monster.

36:38.119 --> 36:41.030
Look at this. All right.

36:38.119 --> 36:41.030
Let's go to the other side.

36:41.039 --> 36:44.030
Hopefully, we'll get a little

36:41.039 --> 36:44.030
second side phenomenon here.

36:44.039 --> 36:48.179
Second side phenomenon

36:44.039 --> 36:48.179
refers to when you do one side,

36:48.190 --> 36:52.010
the body kind of teaches you

36:48.190 --> 36:52.010
what the challenges

36:52.019 --> 36:55.010
are gonna be, so by the time

36:52.019 --> 36:55.010
you go to the second side,

36:55.019 --> 36:56.239
it takes half the time.

36:56.250 --> 36:58.170
This one was easier

36:56.250 --> 36:58.170
because it was smaller.

36:58.179 --> 37:01.199
Okay,

36:58.179 --> 37:01.199
so we've stayed well above

37:01.210 --> 37:03.110
where the lymphatics

37:01.210 --> 37:03.110
are located.

37:03.119 --> 37:05.119
Definitely not into

37:03.119 --> 37:05.119
the arteries and veins.

37:05.130 --> 37:08.199
The ectopic

37:05.130 --> 37:08.199
extra breast tissue is gone.

37:08.210 --> 37:10.269
I think it's a home run.

37:10.280 --> 37:13.019
And we didn't meet any tigers.

37:18.039 --> 37:22.030
Hello, young lady.

37:18.039 --> 37:22.030
Hey, how are you doing?

37:22.039 --> 37:23.199
-How do you feel?

37:22.039 --> 37:23.199
-I feel good.

37:23.210 --> 37:25.010
I feel really good actually.

37:25.019 --> 37:26.260
So let's see

37:25.019 --> 37:26.260
what it looks like.

37:28.210 --> 37:31.019
So, can you see this?

37:31.030 --> 37:33.059
Here. Let me take

37:31.030 --> 37:33.059
a picture of it for you.

37:33.070 --> 37:36.019
So this is what it looks like.

37:36.030 --> 37:39.199
Pretty great.

37:36.030 --> 37:39.199
So the skin's nice and tight.

37:39.210 --> 37:41.119
Here's the other one.

37:41.130 --> 37:43.130
-Let's see.

37:41.130 --> 37:43.130
-Looks great.

37:43.139 --> 37:45.019
The scar

37:43.139 --> 37:45.019
is a small price to pay.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.269
You're not gonna

37:45.030 --> 37:46.269
really be able to see it.

37:46.280 --> 37:48.070
It's going to be covered.

37:48.079 --> 37:50.030
Yeah, it'll shrivel up.

37:50.039 --> 37:53.000
Yeah, it's crazy.

37:50.039 --> 37:53.000
It's still so surreal that--

37:53.010 --> 37:54.099
that I'm here.

37:54.110 --> 37:56.059
I can't wait

37:54.110 --> 37:56.059
to wear what I want

37:56.070 --> 37:57.190
and just be more confident.

37:57.199 --> 38:00.119
I'm so excited.

37:57.199 --> 38:00.119
I'm so, so excited.

38:01.110 --> 38:03.280
I'm so overwhelmed.

38:11.210 --> 38:14.030
I'm so thankful for Dr. Dubrow.

38:14.039 --> 38:16.230
He just did what

38:14.039 --> 38:16.230
he knew he needed to do,

38:16.239 --> 38:19.159
and I can't wait to

38:16.239 --> 38:19.159
see them when they're healed.

38:19.170 --> 38:21.039
Beautiful job.

38:21.050 --> 38:23.010
-Big change.

38:21.050 --> 38:23.010
-I'm excited for her.

38:23.019 --> 38:25.030
It's a big day for her.

38:25.039 --> 38:26.239
-Donezo.

38:25.039 --> 38:26.239
-Done.

38:26.250 --> 38:28.179
All you have to do now is heal.

38:28.190 --> 38:32.059
To be able to wear

38:28.190 --> 38:32.059
my dream wedding dress

38:32.070 --> 38:36.050

38:32.070 --> 38:36.050
three years feels amazing.

our wedding day.

39:01.179 --> 39:05.090
On my wedding day, I had

39:01.179 --> 39:05.090
to wear a long sleeved dress.

39:05.099 --> 39:07.070
I didn't get to wear

39:05.099 --> 39:07.070
my dream dress

39:07.079 --> 39:10.239
because I had to cover up

39:07.079 --> 39:10.239
the breasts in my armpits.

39:28.079 --> 39:31.030
It's been so long

39:28.079 --> 39:31.030
since I've seen Samantha

39:31.039 --> 39:32.239
in a sleeveless dress,

39:32.250 --> 39:35.190
and I can tell

39:32.250 --> 39:35.190
she's just overloaded with joy.

39:35.199 --> 39:38.269
Before my surgery,

39:35.199 --> 39:38.269
I had four breasts

39:38.280 --> 39:41.000
and two of them

39:38.280 --> 39:41.000
were in my armpits.

39:41.010 --> 39:44.159
They made me insecure

39:41.010 --> 39:44.159
and they rubbed raw.

39:44.170 --> 39:46.289
But now, thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

39:47.000 --> 39:49.039
my armpits looks normal again.

39:49.050 --> 39:52.110
There's no more chafing,

39:49.050 --> 39:52.110
no more embarrassment.

I can finally wear

39:52.119 --> 39:55.159
the wedding dress of my dreams

39:55.170 --> 40:00.019
without worrying about

39:55.170 --> 40:00.019
what my underarms look like.

40:00.030 --> 40:02.150

I'm getting

40:56.170 --> 40:58.099
to experience things

40:58.110 --> 41:00.159
I should have gotten

40:58.110 --> 41:00.159
to experience a long time ago.

41:00.170 --> 41:02.050
Taking these new bridal photos

41:02.059 --> 41:03.239
and getting up close

41:02.059 --> 41:03.239
and personal,

41:03.250 --> 41:05.159
I feel like

41:03.250 --> 41:05.159
I never got that opportunity

41:05.170 --> 41:08.159
because the prior surgeon

41:05.170 --> 41:08.159
took that away from me.

41:08.170 --> 41:10.010
Yes.

41:10.019 --> 41:12.000
Looking back, I feel like

41:10.019 --> 41:12.000
I'm on the other side

41:12.010 --> 41:14.280
of a mountain now. I no

41:12.010 --> 41:14.280
longer have a pulverized nose.

I finally feel like

41:23.150 --> 41:25.159
a beautiful bride,

41:25.170 --> 41:28.050
and now the photographer

41:25.170 --> 41:28.050
can get as close to this nose

as she wants.

41:32.280 --> 41:35.250

I looked like

41:35.260 --> 41:37.190
I live in Whoville.

41:37.199 --> 41:39.219
I had a ski slope

41:37.199 --> 41:39.219
for a profile.

41:39.230 --> 41:42.099
It was crooked

41:39.230 --> 41:42.099
and there was a chunk missing

41:42.110 --> 41:45.010
on the right side.

41:42.110 --> 41:45.010
But now, thanks to Dr. Nassif,

41:45.019 --> 41:46.199
my tip is round and smooth

41:46.210 --> 41:49.119
and my nose is straight

41:46.210 --> 41:49.119
and symmetrical.

41:49.130 --> 41:51.119
I'm going to put the photos

41:49.130 --> 41:51.119
up on the wall.

41:51.130 --> 41:53.280
My mom says

41:51.130 --> 41:53.280
she wants an eight by ten.

41:56.159 --> 41:58.239
Your nose seriously

41:56.159 --> 41:58.239
looks awesome.

41:58.250 --> 42:00.139
Thank you, I appreciate that.

42:00.150 --> 42:03.039
Dr. Nassif

42:00.150 --> 42:03.039
did an incredible job.

42:03.050 --> 42:06.010
He's the best

42:03.050 --> 42:06.010
and you're the best.

42:06.019 --> 42:08.000
Thank you

42:06.019 --> 42:08.000
for being on this journey.

42:08.010 --> 42:10.070
Of course, I'm happy

42:08.010 --> 42:10.070
I could be there by your side

42:10.079 --> 42:12.179
-and nurse you back to health.

42:10.079 --> 42:12.179
-Oh, thank you.

42:12.190 --> 42:14.280
I'm glad that

42:12.190 --> 42:14.280
he didn't pulverize your nose.

42:14.289 --> 42:17.110
-He made it a nice nose.

42:14.289 --> 42:17.110
-He did.

42:17.119 --> 42:20.119
Her personality has completely

42:17.119 --> 42:20.119
changed for the better.

42:20.130 --> 42:23.030
I've noticed that

42:20.130 --> 42:23.030
Holly's confidence is back,

42:23.039 --> 42:27.280
and I'm just so happy she can

42:23.039 --> 42:27.280
really start this new chapter.

42:27.289 --> 42:29.190
I feel like myself again,

42:27.289 --> 42:29.190
you know,

42:29.199 --> 42:33.159
I feel like I can

42:29.199 --> 42:33.159
go out there and be confident

42:33.170 --> 42:35.039
and be the old goofy me.

42:35.050 --> 42:37.050
Yeah, we'll have to start

42:35.050 --> 42:37.050
taking more pics together.

42:37.059 --> 42:38.260
I know.

42:41.079 --> 42:43.070
Sometimes you have to wait

42:43.079 --> 42:46.050
a long time for things in life

42:46.059 --> 42:48.269
to get what you want

42:46.059 --> 42:48.269
or for things to work out.

42:48.280 --> 42:51.130
I'd like to tell

42:48.280 --> 42:51.130
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow,

42:51.139 --> 42:55.150
thank you so much from

42:51.139 --> 42:55.150
the bottom of my heart, like,

42:55.159 --> 42:59.139
what they've done for me,

42:55.159 --> 42:59.139
is completely amazing.

42:59.150 --> 43:03.190
I didn't feel like a person.

42:59.150 --> 43:03.190
I felt just, like...

43:05.000 --> 43:07.190
Some ugly monster before,

43:05.000 --> 43:07.190
you know,

43:07.199 --> 43:10.010
so it's like

43:07.199 --> 43:10.010
they brought me back to life.

43:10.019 --> 43:11.159
I love you.

43:11.170 --> 43:13.170
I'm so proud of you

43:11.170 --> 43:13.170
for taking the risk.

43:13.179 --> 43:16.219
We're gonna have to fight over

43:13.179 --> 43:16.219
who has the best nose now.

43:17.159 --> 43:19.130
Why don't you wait

43:17.159 --> 43:19.130
'til the baby comes out?

43:19.139 --> 43:22.019
If it has a hairy back,

43:19.139 --> 43:22.019
Paulina.

43:22.030 --> 43:24.019
It's silicone or go home.

43:24.030 --> 43:25.199
What size implants

43:24.030 --> 43:25.199
did you start with?

43:25.210 --> 43:27.019
550.

43:27.030 --> 43:28.289
-Okay. Pretty big.

43:27.030 --> 43:28.289
-Pretty small.

43:29.000 --> 43:33.190
My left side looks like a big

43:29.000 --> 43:33.190
bull shark came up and just--

43:33.199 --> 43:37.039
The big question is,

43:33.199 --> 43:37.039
will this fat survive?

43:37.050 --> 43:40.190
I hope it works, and if

43:37.050 --> 43:40.190
it does, I'm a ----ing genius.

43:40.199 --> 43:42.059
When I breathe...

43:42.070 --> 43:43.139
[breathing]

43:43.150 --> 43:44.139
Everything collapses.

43:44.150 --> 43:46.000
I don't want to have no nose.
