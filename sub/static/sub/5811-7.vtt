WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:03.446
Previously on Arrow...

00:11.680 --> 00:13.887
<i>Doctor Palmer
got miniaturization to work.</i>

00:14.120 --> 00:15.246
FELICITYI Do it!

00:18.960 --> 00:20.086
I'm not dead.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.562
This is Delta two-three-seven
en route to Star City Bank.

00:36.760 --> 00:38.728
We are under attack
and need immediate assistance.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.767
The Ghosts. They're back to
knocking over armored cars.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.763
Yeah, it's just like old times.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.844
- There are guards in the back.
- All right, we'll get them.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.121
Go!

01:56.640 --> 01:58.324
They burnt all the money.

01:58.920 --> 01:59.967
They didn't need it.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.964
The federal government sent this
to prop up Star City Bank.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.648
HIVE just wanted to make sure
that didn't happen.

02:13.120 --> 02:14.167
I've heard of having money to burn,

02:14.360 --> 02:16.442
but stealing money to burn, that's new.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.841
Darhk's not kidding.
He really wants this city to die.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.402
Yeah, but why? I mean, what does
HIVE have to gain from any of this?

02:24.400 --> 02:25.811
A base of operations.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.324
They have to be able to
operate out of somewhere.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.130
What better spot than a dead city?

02:30.280 --> 02:31.805
With almost a dead police department.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.047
Any luck from that tooth

02:33.200 --> 02:34.565
we got off the HIVE member
that we took down?

02:34.720 --> 02:36.643
Only that the deterioration
of the DNA markers

02:36.840 --> 02:38.968
was most definitely not natural.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.122
Which means it was caused by what?

02:41.280 --> 02:43.442
Curtis and I have been trying to
figure that out for the past month.

02:43.640 --> 02:44.687
Maybe Ray will have better luck.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.126
I will ask.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.726
Hey, you got a sec?

02:48.160 --> 02:49.207
Yeah.

03:02.480 --> 03:04.528
- Where'd you get this?
- I got that from Lance.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.484
Who got it from Damien Darhk.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.041
- John, this...
- Ls pretty definitive evidence

03:09.720 --> 03:11.210
that HIVE had Andy killed

03:11.360 --> 03:14.204
because his criminal operations
conflicted with theirs.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.364
That doesn't track at all
with what you've told me about Andy.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.444
Oliver, that doesn't track
with what I knew about Andy.

03:20.600 --> 03:24.002
But I guess I really
never knew him at all.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.525
- There's got to be some explanation.
- Oliver...

03:25.720 --> 03:26.801
- Maybe he was undercover.
- No, man.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.088
Listen, it's all right there.
The facts are the facts.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.607
All I'm saying, Andy was your brother,

03:31.760 --> 03:33.603
and he deserves the benefit of the doubt.

03:33.760 --> 03:36.411
Trust me, things aren't always
what they seem.

03:36.560 --> 03:37.721
Yeah. Yeah.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.444
Reiter's not gonna like this.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.046
Not one bit.

03:44.600 --> 03:48.127
Vlad was a good worker.
And they listened to him.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.806
I didn't have a choice.
He was gonna kill me.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.645
Doesn't sound like something he'd do.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.929
Maybe... Maybe he didn't
have a choice either.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.722
Maybe someone put him up to it.

03:58.920 --> 04:00.331
Maybe it was revenge.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.246
Revenge for what?

04:02.400 --> 04:03.686
For Taiana.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.168
That drug-stealing bitch you choked out?

04:07.440 --> 04:08.805
Vlad was her brother.

04:14.560 --> 04:15.607
Ah!

04:15.760 --> 04:17.569
Thank you for coming by
on such short notice.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.608
Oh. Happy to have something to do.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.129
To be honest,
I'm feeling at a bit of a loss

04:22.320 --> 04:23.685
of what to do with my newfound freedom.

04:23.840 --> 04:24.887
And height.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.326
Is everything always this big?

04:26.480 --> 04:28.323
If you're looking for something to do,
why not try,

04:28.480 --> 04:31.768
I don't know, declare yourself undead,
try getting your company back?

04:32.440 --> 04:34.602
You said you had something
that you needed help on?

04:34.760 --> 04:37.001
- Don't change the subject.
- I'm not.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.481
I'm a recently undead billionaire CEO.

04:39.640 --> 04:40.801
My time is at a premium.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.406
What can I do for you?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.241
Thanks. I was wondering
where my tooth went.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.164
John pulled this off of a Ghost.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.288
It's their cyanide retirement plan.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.606
We tried pulling DNA off it, but...

04:53.760 --> 04:56.286
But half of the genetic markers
are missing. That's impossible.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.804
You mean like a guy who can shrink to
the size of a French fry impossible?

05:01.600 --> 05:03.967
Do you have any equipment?
I'm fresh out of chromatographs.

05:04.280 --> 05:05.327
Take that.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.805
Can we circle back to why
you won't come back to Palmer Tech?

05:09.960 --> 05:11.803
Your return is exactly
what our stock price needs, and...

05:11.960 --> 05:13.200
That's incredible.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.370
The genetic code has been
selectively degraded.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.329
We know. We think it's to
scramble their DNA markers

05:17.480 --> 05:19.323
so they can't be lD'd. But how?

05:20.520 --> 05:22.807
Looks like it was done
with a synthetic compound.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.610
Like a chemical CRISPR/Cas9.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.010
Lastrapium trioxide.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.003
Wolfman Biologics has a patent on it.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.401
Thank you.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.683
Okay, tomorrow night,
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association Gala.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.205
It's black tie, so you need a tux.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.811
Which one? He's got, like, 50.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.166
Uh...

05:41.360 --> 05:43.408
Maybe back in the day. I don't have a tux.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.369
Get a rental. it doesn't really matter.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.205
Every mayor in the history of Star City
has attended the PBA.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.362
I secured a spot for you
on the dais with the brass.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.249
We need to make sure
that your keynote is on point.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.882
Which means we need to find a way to say
that the police need our help without...

05:56.080 --> 05:58.048
- Throwing them under the bus.
- Right.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.525
I thought you failed civics class?

06:01.680 --> 06:04.365
A D-minus, thank you.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.727
Alex has a way of making this interesting.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.404
Sorry, wrong number. What were we saying?

06:14.640 --> 06:16.881
Uh... Moving on to Oliver's platform.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.841
I got your e-mail about
cleaning up Star City Bay.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.570
- Yes.
- Yeah, it's, you know,

06:21.720 --> 06:23.404
with everything
this city's facing right now,

06:23.560 --> 06:24.971
a hippie-crunchy program...

06:25.120 --> 06:28.602
A hippie-crunchy program
that will add hundreds ofjobs,

06:28.760 --> 06:30.171
help gentrify
the surrounding neighborhoods,

06:30.320 --> 06:31.651
and encourage outside investment.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.882
And put voters to sleep.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.684
We need to focus on crime and jobs.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.729
Which this program will address.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.246
Hey, I will put out
a press release tomorrow.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.925
- I got to take this.
- Okay.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.005
I think your brother is onto us.

06:48.200 --> 06:52.285
No. No, and even if he was,
it's not like he's the boss of me.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.248
- No, he's the boss of me.
- I know.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.004
I'm really glad
your brother's not a killer.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.003
- Oh.
- Speedy. Speedy.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.207
Uh...

07:01.920 --> 07:04.287
Thea. Sorry, it's a nickname.
We have to go.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.606
Felicity called about the thing.
The dental problem.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.410
Uh, yes, yeah.

07:09.560 --> 07:14.327
Sorry, um, our friend has
this tooth issue. Yeah.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.720
Good work.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.006
On site.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.806
We're clear for entry.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.451
All right, Felicity, what's next?

07:32.600 --> 07:34.090
We need a sample of the chemical.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.607
<i>With it, Ray can unscramble
the DNA markers</i>

07:36.760 --> 07:39.286
<i>and we can have a shot at
lD'ing some of our Ghosts.</i>

07:39.440 --> 07:40.851
Where do we find this thing?

07:41.320 --> 07:43.800
According to their
recently hacked computers,

07:43.960 --> 07:46.281
second floor, northwest corner.
It's a yellow liquid.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.609
Incoming. Four Ghosts. North entrance.

07:52.280 --> 07:53.691
I'm on it.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.731
Felicity, we're in.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.366
<i>Looking for the compound.</i>

08:19.320 --> 08:20.560
Got it.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.130
<i>Green Arrow
and Speedy need assistance.</i>

08:27.280 --> 08:29.521
- Thanks.
- You should go. Get out of here.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.525
- What about you?
- I've got this. Go.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.921
Felicity, I'm going for an ID
on the Ghost that shot at us.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.206
<i>Stand by.</i>

08:47.000 --> 08:48.047
Andy?

09:02.440 --> 09:06.525
Well, even death's not permanent anymore.
I'm sorry.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.081
No, no, it's okay.
Nothing seems to make sense anymore.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.047
Andy... I can't believe this.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.049
It's obvious that HIVE faked his death.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.969
- Maybe it was part of his recruitment.
- You saw the file.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.561
You saw what kind of man my brother was,
what kind of man he is.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.769
We don't know anything.
Not until we hear it directly from Andy.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.331
And how are we supposed to do that?

09:24.480 --> 09:25.641
We get him out of HIVE.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.082
Oliver, how can you still be giving him
the benefit of the doubt?

09:28.240 --> 09:29.685
Because he's your family.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.087
You said he was a good man,
maybe a part of him still is.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.366
- I don't know.
- I do.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.490
Last month, at the lumber yard, a Ghost
had a chance to kill you, but didn't.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.206
I remember thinking how weird that was.
Unless that Ghost was Andy.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.691
So, what, he had a chance to kill me
and he didn't,

09:40.840 --> 09:42.001
so I'm just supposed to
forget he's a killer?

09:42.160 --> 09:44.811
No, but you should still remember
he's your brother.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.850
I can't square that circle, Thea.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.481
That HIVE member was
nothing like my brother.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.610
The man who was my brother's dead.
He's dead.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.804
- What brother?
- The brother of the prisoner

09:59.960 --> 10:01.121
that stole the drugs.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.408
But only because he put him up to it.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.166
You're crazy. That prisoner attacked you
'cause what you did to his sister.

10:06.320 --> 10:07.367
That's a lie.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.205
It's a hell of a lot more believable
than me putting him up to attacking you.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.407
You know what? You have had it in for me

10:11.560 --> 10:13.403
- ever since you found that knapsack.
- Enough.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.922
I have a means of divining the truth.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.769
Why did you kill that prisoner?

10:22.640 --> 10:23.801
Because he attacked me.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.647
Oh, come on, man.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.962
This isn't the place for
your hocus-pocus crap.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.722
Did you have that prisoner
attack Mr. Queen?

10:31.880 --> 10:33.006
Hell no.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.847
You're lying.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.525
According to what? A bunch of twigs?

10:40.080 --> 10:42.128
No, Reiter, don't do this.
You got to hear me out.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.682
It's him. He's the problem.
He's the problem! Hey!

10:45.840 --> 10:47.171
What are you gonna do to him?

10:47.320 --> 10:48.560
Nothing.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.326
I believe the wronged
should make things right.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.365
So, you wanted to see me?

11:01.840 --> 11:03.251
So polite. That's a bit atypical.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.165
Well, a guy gets slapped down
enough times, he learns who's boss.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.200
Apparently not.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.971
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

11:12.520 --> 11:15.410
After our meeting last week,
I had an unpleasant encounter

11:15.560 --> 11:17.688
with the Green Arrow and his compatriots.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.605
My security personnel
are under the opinion

11:20.760 --> 11:24.845
that you called that meeting so as to
create an opportunity to have me followed.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.890
So your security guys don't trust me,
but what about you?

11:28.080 --> 11:30.606
Trust is an orchid.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.683
Beautiful but delicate.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.443
Requiring ideal conditions
in order to thrive.

11:36.600 --> 11:40.525
Without those conditions, it dies.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.086
Tread carefully, Quentin.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.410
Believe it or not,
the death of your daughter

11:48.600 --> 11:51.365
is not the most terrible thing
that I can threaten you with.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.969
I don't want to talk to you.

12:12.320 --> 12:13.970
<i>Then why are
you answering the phone?</i>

12:14.960 --> 12:16.610
Because I...

12:19.080 --> 12:23.005
I would have told you I was stopping by,
but you weren't taking my calls.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.241
What do you want?

12:24.400 --> 12:25.447
To help you.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.203
Those men you killed in Nanda Parbat,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.321
the effects of those deaths
must be wearing off by now.

12:31.520 --> 12:32.567
I'm fine.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.290
The bloodlust has returned, hasn't it?

12:34.760 --> 12:35.966
I have it under control.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.770
You can't control it, Thea.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.330
Who's Lawrence Tanner?

12:44.880 --> 12:45.961
A pedophile.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.401
Multiple accusations, no convictions.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.091
<i>Lives three blocks down.</i>

12:50.240 --> 12:51.890
The world needs one less pedophile,

12:52.080 --> 12:54.321
and you need at least a month of peace.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.967
Look, I'm gonna go out. Okay?

12:57.120 --> 12:58.281
And when I come home,

12:58.440 --> 13:02.001
you better not still be here,
or I am calling the police.

13:10.760 --> 13:11.886
Hey-

13:13.080 --> 13:15.924
Alex hired a security detail,
if you want to sit this one out.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.411
Yeah, I'm gonna be at the bar.

13:18.720 --> 13:22.008
Well, this has to be a better way
than how you usually spend your evenings.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.288
Dressing in leather and tying people up.

13:25.360 --> 13:26.850
There he is.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.650
They're waiting for you on the dais.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.281
Ready for this?

13:30.960 --> 13:32.371
About to find out.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.801
<i>Evening.</i>

13:37.600 --> 13:39.887
<i>It is our great privilege</i>

13:40.040 --> 13:43.931
<i>to be here tonight
to honor the Star City Police Department.</i>

13:44.320 --> 13:45.970
<i>These are a group of men and women</i>

13:46.120 --> 13:49.010
<i>who risk their lives for us
on a daily basis.</i>

13:49.160 --> 13:50.685
<i>Never been an easy job.</i>

13:50.840 --> 13:52.649
<i>And it has certainly
never been more difficult</i>

13:52.800 --> 13:54.689
<i>than it is right now in our city.</i>

13:55.120 --> 13:57.202
<i>These are the people
that keep our streets safe,</i>

13:57.800 --> 13:59.086
<i>who watch over us.</i>

13:59.560 --> 14:00.766
<i>They protect us.</i>

14:01.560 --> 14:04.609
<i>For that, I'm grateful,
and so is the rest of Star City.</i>

14:13.960 --> 14:15.041
Not bad.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.521
Not quite as powerful
as the Green Arrow's, but not bad.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.160
Yeah? Maybe I should get him
to endorse me.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.208
I need a favor from you.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.568
Relocation of
one of Darhk's foot soldiers.

14:25.760 --> 14:26.841
Could be a little difficult.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.047
Darhk called me
into his office this morning

14:28.200 --> 14:29.804
for a little chat about
how he doesn't trust me anymore.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.962
Wait, wait, wait. Are you in danger?

14:32.480 --> 14:33.606
I hope not.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.685
But listen, when I was there,
I saw something on his desk.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.366
Something about Slip 52 down at the docks.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.324
Now, if the Ghosts are there,

14:41.520 --> 14:43.045
maybe the one you're looking for
will be there too.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.884
- Okay. Thank you.
- All right.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.483
Hey, honey. How are you?

14:49.440 --> 14:51.044
- Here you go, miss.
- Thank you.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.560
Club soda?

14:54.680 --> 14:55.761
Yeah, it has to be.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.446
Can't have the candidate's bodyguard
getting hammered.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.361
Do you want to talk about it?

15:01.040 --> 15:04.328
Resurrected siblings are
kind of in my wheelhouse.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.924
This ain't quite the same thing, Laurel.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.247
Sara wasn't really a...

15:10.400 --> 15:13.483
A member of an organization of killers?

15:14.240 --> 15:16.925
I'm sure there are a million things
going through your head right now.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.401
All I'm saying is, make one of them

15:19.600 --> 15:22.922
an appreciation for the fact
that your brother is actually alive.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.286
Well, why?

15:24.600 --> 15:29.527
Why, so I can hold out some kind of
false hope that he might be decent?

15:29.680 --> 15:30.920
He doesn't deserve that.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.764
No, he probably doesn't, but you do.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.647
<i>After Andy died, a part of you died, too.</i>

15:35.880 --> 15:38.929
And now, now is your chance to heal.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.690
How am I supposed to do that?

15:42.360 --> 15:46.251
I had to look my nephew in the eye

15:47.120 --> 15:48.645
and tell him that

15:51.040 --> 15:53.168
he was never gonna see his daddy again.

15:58.440 --> 16:01.284
And the months after Andy died
were the darkest times in my life.

16:01.800 --> 16:05.407
I would've given anything,
anything to get Andy back.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.885
I would've sacrificed my life

16:09.840 --> 16:12.127
to have him back
with his wife and his son.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.482
I would've traded my life for a stranger.

16:19.320 --> 16:21.800
- Mr. Queen, it's so nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.480
Do you think you can get
more funding for the SCPD?

16:24.640 --> 16:26.165
Well, that's certainly a top priority.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.685
- That's great news. Thank you.
- Sure.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.008
Mr. Queen. Huge fan.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.484
Thank you, Mr...

16:32.640 --> 16:34.005
Darhk.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.686
I have some ideas on
how I might contribute to your campaign.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.330
- Do you have a minute?
- Of course.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.680
Well, it's not just about
financial support.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.170
I have strong relations
in the business circles.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.401
Media outlets as well.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.927
This is all well and good,
but I am running unopposed.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.488
So I don't totally understand
how you could help me win.

16:50.640 --> 16:51.846
Oh, it's not about winning.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.970
It's about how much we could accomplish
if we worked together.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.201
Right.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.885
And not to be indelicate, but

16:58.040 --> 17:00.805
a lot has changed in Star City
since your parents held sway here.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.405
The levers of power have changed.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.689
And not understanding that is
what doomed Jessica Danforth's bid.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.327
Hmm.

17:08.440 --> 17:09.601
What do you want, Mr. Darhk?

17:09.760 --> 17:11.808
I read the press release
about your new project.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.088
"The restoration of Starling Bay."

17:14.240 --> 17:16.891
Reconsider your plans.
Leave the Bay as it is.

17:17.720 --> 17:18.767
What if I refuse?

17:18.920 --> 17:21.844
Well, then you'll no longer be unopposed.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.411
Mr. Queen.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.040
Mr. Darhk.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.330
Leaving to fight Ra's on a mountaintop,

17:36.480 --> 17:38.209
going undercover
with the League of Assassins,

17:38.360 --> 17:39.646
dating the Huntress...

17:39.800 --> 17:41.131
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

17:41.280 --> 17:44.170
I'm just listing all of the terrible ideas
you've had over the past three years,

17:44.320 --> 17:47.085
of which throwing in with Damien Darhk
has got to be the worst.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.447
I'm not throwing in with Damien Darhk.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.602
I am using him to get at HIVE.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.205
Isn't Lance already our man on the inside?

17:53.360 --> 17:56.569
Lance has lost Darhk's trust,
making this the only way...

17:56.760 --> 17:57.966
To get yourself killed.

17:58.280 --> 17:59.805
You remember the last time

17:59.960 --> 18:02.281
you tried to take down
an evil organization from the inside?

18:02.440 --> 18:03.566
- This is different.
- Why?

18:03.720 --> 18:05.085
Because you'd be doing it as Oliver Queen?

18:05.240 --> 18:06.287
Yep.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.005
What about your mayoral campaign?

18:08.840 --> 18:12.970
You cannot be an effective candidate
for mayor and Darhk's undercover stooge.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.043
Taking
down Darhk is more important.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.363
Especially now that we know
that he has Andy under his thumb.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.967
First, there's a whole long list of things
that we don't know about Andy.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.164
Second, you didn't decide
to run for mayor to take down Darhk.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.608
You did it to give this city something
that the Green Arrow can't give them.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.123
Hope. Inspiration.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.281
Don't lose sight of that.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.081
Not even for John.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.769
This man betrayed us.

18:51.080 --> 18:54.641
He sent an innocent man,
a useful man, to his grave.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.964
He conspired against me, you,
all of his brothers.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.451
Baron, please.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.489
His punishment won't come from me,

19:02.640 --> 19:04.642
but from the one he sought to hurt.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.051
<i>Oliver, please.</i>

19:13.200 --> 19:14.326
Don't do this.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.526
I'm begging you.

19:17.480 --> 19:18.891
Come on, Queen.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.171
Please! Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for everything.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.005
Please, don't do this.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.320
Harder.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.727
So, I'm sorry.

19:50.880 --> 19:54.202
Your friend was reunited
with his brother after eight years?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.169
It's crazy, right?

19:56.320 --> 19:57.481
Yeah, crazy.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.487
So have you given him your crown yet?

20:01.120 --> 20:04.920
I mean, you held the record with
five years thinking Oliver was dead, so...

20:05.080 --> 20:06.127
Ah.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.010
I can't imagine how tough
it must have been for you, Thea.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.208
I'm sorry.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.411
- You know, I should probably take this.
- Okay.

20:17.560 --> 20:18.971
This is Alex. Sorry.

20:19.600 --> 20:20.681
Yeah, what's up?

20:22.240 --> 20:24.288
Hi, there. What're you drinking?

20:25.160 --> 20:26.207
Maybe I can buy you another.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.727
I don't think my date
would like that very much.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.405
Well, I don't see him here.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.444
You look like the kind of girl
where "no" means "yes."

20:33.600 --> 20:34.761
Come on, baby.

20:44.560 --> 20:48.326
Thea! Stop! What the hell are you doing?

20:59.760 --> 21:01.046
Can't do it?

21:03.440 --> 21:05.329
I can't believe that Andy's back.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.444
How am I supposed to tell Carly?

21:12.680 --> 21:14.250
She has a right to know, Johnnie.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.805
She's better off thinking he's dead.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.650
I'm not sure that's your call to make.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.370
I'm not sure about anything.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.608
You know, when I first found out
about the Flash,

21:25.440 --> 21:27.727
and Lazarus Pit, and what it did for Thea,

21:29.800 --> 21:31.962
I began to daydream about Andy being back.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.651
I would just play with that idea,

21:38.760 --> 21:40.125
"My brother's back."

21:44.280 --> 21:45.805
I never thought it would actually happen.

21:46.520 --> 21:47.567
I know.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.846
I'll get it.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.207
Hi, Lyla.

22:00.480 --> 22:01.527
Hi, Oliver.

22:01.840 --> 22:03.444
- May I come in?
- Sure.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.651
- I'll give you two a minute.
- Okay.

22:17.640 --> 22:18.846
How are you holding up?

22:19.720 --> 22:21.609
Uh, I guess as good
as can be expected, right?

22:21.760 --> 22:23.205
Nothing really to compare this to.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.286
At least not this week.

22:28.240 --> 22:30.288
- Lance has some intel for us.
- Mmm.

22:30.440 --> 22:31.646
Slip 52 at the docks.

22:31.800 --> 22:32.847
Felicity checked it out,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.048
and that whole area has been
shut down for the entire night.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.611
You think the Ghosts have
something planned there?

22:36.800 --> 22:38.165
And maybe your brother.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.524
Every time we face the Ghosts,
it's Russian roulette.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.250
I'm not risking any of you for Andy.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.845
You're not. We're offering.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.482
Okay. But just us.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.604
Thea and Laurel sit this one out.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.770
_OkaY-_OkaY-

22:58.520 --> 23:02.570
Gentlemen, you've all
come here from different walks.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.086
Different paths.

23:04.760 --> 23:07.047
But all burdened with the same knowledge,

23:07.800 --> 23:10.007
that this world is diseased.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.729
Fortunately, there is a cure
for this pestilence.

23:16.160 --> 23:18.891
That cure, gentlemen, is HIVE.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.323
Those little yellow pills you swallowed,

23:21.480 --> 23:23.448
they do a few interesting things,

23:23.600 --> 23:26.604
including making you cooperative.

23:27.080 --> 23:30.323
Now I understand you all volunteered,
and that's just swell,

23:30.840 --> 23:33.571
but I think we can all agree
that in any chain of command,

23:33.760 --> 23:36.889
there can never be too much compliance.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.770
Perhaps a demonstration.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.081
KneeL

23:50.880 --> 23:54.487
The people of this city,
well, what's left of them, at any rate,

23:54.640 --> 23:57.644
they call you "Ghosts."

23:59.800 --> 24:02.690
They have no idea how right they are.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.481
<i>Up</i> there!

24:07.040 --> 24:08.121
Kill the green one.

25:08.480 --> 25:10.323
This isn't on you, John. It was my call.

25:11.680 --> 25:13.330
And I never should have let you make it.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.321
Felicity, can you give us a second?

25:15.480 --> 25:16.686
No, I think I should stay.

25:18.680 --> 25:23.049
But I just remembered I got that thing
in the whatever with the what's it.

25:23.880 --> 25:25.530
Oliver, let this go, man.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.126
I have.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.209
And you almost got yourself killed.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.204
I've been a lot closer to "almost killed."

25:33.360 --> 25:34.521
Andy made his choice.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.131
You don't know that.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.171
John, you saw what was going on tonight.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.800
Those men were under
the influence of something.

25:40.960 --> 25:42.928
Whatever pill is scrambling their DNA

25:43.080 --> 25:45.606
is also making them susceptible
to Darhk's suggestion.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.649
<i>All right. Just because you have
a blind spot for your family,</i>

25:47.800 --> 25:48.961
don't expect me to as well.

25:49.120 --> 25:51.043
- That's not what this is about.
- The hell it's not.

25:51.720 --> 25:53.927
Family is exactly what this is about.

25:54.560 --> 25:57.962
Criminal or not,
under the influence or not,

25:58.160 --> 26:00.970
Andy let his son and his wife
believe he was dead,

26:01.160 --> 26:02.241
for eight years, Oliver.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.890
Eight years!

26:05.360 --> 26:07.203
And there's no excuse for that!

26:08.240 --> 26:10.481
- None.
- John, I'm... You don't know.

26:10.640 --> 26:11.721
Oliver, you don't know.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.081
You have this inexplicable way of

26:13.240 --> 26:14.605
excusing everything
just because it's family.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.926
Oh, it's not "inexplicable."

26:16.080 --> 26:18.242
I'm asking you...

26:18.400 --> 26:22.485
I'm asking you to hold out hope for Andy
because I need that hope.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.610
I need to believe that
no matter what happens in our lives,

26:26.760 --> 26:29.411
no matter how much darkness infects us,

26:29.560 --> 26:32.450
I need to believe
that we can come back from that!

26:32.600 --> 26:35.604
<i>And it was exactly that thinking
that led you to the League last year.</i>

26:37.440 --> 26:39.283
Doesn't seem like
you learned much from that.

26:39.680 --> 26:40.727
Felicity told you.

26:40.880 --> 26:42.370
Getting in bed with Darhk, Oliver,

26:42.520 --> 26:44.363
I don't see how you can even consider it.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.723
We are gonna take this guy down.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.763
And no idea is off the table.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.088
Look, you're doing things
differently, Oliver.

26:55.520 --> 26:59.730
Fighting Darhk from the inside
is just fighting Darhk in the shadows.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.366
You want to do things differently?

27:01.520 --> 27:03.443
You want ideas? Fine.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.371
Let's take this son of a bitch down
in the light of day.

27:16.440 --> 27:17.487
Hey-

27:18.040 --> 27:19.121
Just in time.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.206
For what?

27:21.800 --> 27:25.600
Roasted lizard with a little bit of
coriander and sea salt.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.007
I've gotten better at removing the skin
with a sharp rock.

27:28.360 --> 27:29.805
I ate already.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.240
Thank you.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.166
<i>Are you all right?</i>

27:39.640 --> 27:40.880
Had a hard day.

27:42.960 --> 27:46.282
Taiana, I have to...

27:48.120 --> 27:50.202
I have to tell you something
about your brother.

27:51.280 --> 27:52.327
Vlad?

27:53.840 --> 27:55.205
Is he all right?

27:56.360 --> 27:57.521
No.

27:58.360 --> 27:59.486
I'm sorry.

27:59.640 --> 28:00.971
What do you mean?

28:01.680 --> 28:04.604
- Is he...
- Taiana, I'm very sorry.

28:13.480 --> 28:14.720
_H€Y-_H€Y-

28:15.160 --> 28:19.643
Sorry, I had Curtis grab some more toys
so I could keep working on your tooth.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.930
That's okay. I don't think
we're gonna be using that

28:22.080 --> 28:24.686
table for eating tonight, anyway.

28:25.080 --> 28:29.642
Oliver and John are busy fighting over
John's not-so-dead-after-all brother.

28:30.120 --> 28:31.246
Do I even want to ask?

28:31.920 --> 28:33.331
Let's just say you no longer
corner the market

28:33.520 --> 28:34.806
on not being as dead as people think.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.725
Though in John's brother's case,
he does have a pretty good excuse.

28:37.880 --> 28:41.566
Unlike some people. Have you seen anyone?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.449
Of course not, I've been busy here
working on your tooth.

28:43.600 --> 28:44.647
<i>You're stalling.</i>

28:44.800 --> 28:47.531
Ray, when you come back from the dead,
you're supposed to start living again.

28:47.720 --> 28:48.881
What's going on?

28:50.560 --> 28:52.483
I've been catching up
on the past six months.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.041
My company, my city, my life.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.926
And I feel like Tom Sawyer
watching his own funeral.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.809
Except in my case, nobody really cares.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.405
That is not true, Ray.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.881
Renaming Starling "Star City" is nice.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.725
But then, take a look
at what's happened to the place.

29:09.240 --> 29:11.720
And my company, this thing I built
that was supposed to outlast me,

29:11.880 --> 29:13.325
is now on life support.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.602
Because it needs you.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.001
To do what?

29:17.280 --> 29:19.442
The same thing I was doing
before I "died"?

29:19.600 --> 29:21.284
Obviously, that didn't amount to anything.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.965
Self-pity is not a good look on you.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.690
Yeah. I don't think it's self-pity.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.683
I think it's self-reflection.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.763
If I'm gonna come back to life,

29:30.600 --> 29:32.762
I have to figure out
what it is that I'm living for.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.601
Okay.

29:36.120 --> 29:38.771
I played around with your bicuspid a bit.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.965
The compound definitely broke down
the residual DNA on the tooth.

29:43.560 --> 29:44.891
It's pretty inventive, actually.

29:45.120 --> 29:49.205
Is there any way to reconstitute the DNA,
so we have a shot at lD'ing these guys?

29:49.360 --> 29:52.921
No. Once the alleles are decomposed,
they're gone for good.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.684
- Yeah.
- So, since that was a dead end,

29:54.840 --> 29:57.366
I took another look at the polymer
the fake tooth was made of.

29:57.560 --> 30:01.531
Uh... I found
faint traces of sodium fluoride.

30:01.680 --> 30:02.727
Like, from water?

30:02.880 --> 30:04.564
There's no way that the
concentration could be high enough

30:04.720 --> 30:06.722
to leave behind any sort of residue.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.086
It would if there was an unusually high

30:08.280 --> 30:10.408
sodium fluoride count
in the drinking water.

30:10.960 --> 30:14.282
Like, say, at a facility that was
closed down for that very reason.

30:16.120 --> 30:18.088
Muller Psychiatric Center.

30:18.640 --> 30:19.926
You gotta admire the irony.

30:20.480 --> 30:23.529
Damien Darhk keeping his army of bad guys
in a defunct loony bin?

30:23.680 --> 30:27.321
Not bad for a guy who thinks
his life didn't add up to anything.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.449
Yeah. Never gonna outlive that one.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.286
Everyone clear on the plan?

30:35.440 --> 30:38.171
You know, I wasn't the first 80 times
we went over it,

30:38.320 --> 30:39.651
but now I think I got it.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.086
What's going on, GUYS?

30:42.880 --> 30:47.044
Felicity found a probable location
for the Ghosts' base of operations.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.249
These guys are not
gonna be easy to take out.

30:49.400 --> 30:50.561
How are you feeling?

30:50.880 --> 30:53.611
We're not trying to take down the Ghosts.
We don't have the manpower.

30:54.600 --> 30:55.840
We're going after Andy.

30:56.560 --> 30:59.530
Guys, Oliver nearly got himself killed
trying to help Andy.

30:59.680 --> 31:00.841
I'm not letting you do the same.

31:01.040 --> 31:04.283
I'm sorry,
but it's not really just up to you.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.882
I did everything that I could
to bring my sister back,

31:07.040 --> 31:08.610
and I think your brother
deserves the same.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.883
No, no. That's just it.
I don't think he does.

31:12.800 --> 31:13.801
I don't know what Oliver told you...

31:13.960 --> 31:16.122
<i>He told them
the only two things that matter.</i>

31:16.280 --> 31:18.965
Andy's under Darhk's influence,
and we need to get him out.

31:19.120 --> 31:21.646
I can't let you risk your lives for
someone who does not deserve it.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.280
That's your call. But we've made ours.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.326
Let's move.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.766
- We're on <i>site.</i>
- Uh...

31:41.960 --> 31:44.247
Satellite's reading a hell of a lot
of activity for 3:00 in the morning.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.721
<i>I'm guessing 50 or so Ghosts,
plus who-knows-how-many recruits.</i>

31:46.920 --> 31:49.651
Wait. If the Ghosts are wearing
their usual Halloween costumes,

31:49.840 --> 31:52.161
then how are we supposed to tell
which one's Andy?

31:52.320 --> 31:54.084
That's what your fancy
new cameras are for.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.844
A little gift from Curtis.

31:57.920 --> 32:00.810
<i>The infrared lenses should
virtually unmask our Ghosty friends.</i>

32:00.960 --> 32:02.007
Sick.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.605
Okay. Ready?

32:09.000 --> 32:10.286
I'm in position.

32:12.480 --> 32:13.606
In position.

32:18.160 --> 32:21.209
This isn't just a base of operations.
It looks like a staging area.

32:21.360 --> 32:22.441
<i>- For what'?
- Equipment.</i>

32:22.600 --> 32:25.809
Military crates marked "G-six-five."

32:26.000 --> 32:27.365
<i>Does that mean anything?</i>

32:27.600 --> 32:28.886
Maybe they're playing Bingo.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.280
Let's assume that's not it.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.204
- Deadly Bingo.
- No.

32:32.360 --> 32:33.725
We need to get an ID on Andy.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.326
When you do,
you wait for my signal before engaging.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.964
Yeah, I might not have that option.

32:39.560 --> 32:40.561
<i>Speedy?</i>

32:40.720 --> 32:42.484
She's been spotted.
Third floor. Southwest building.

32:42.640 --> 32:43.880
I've been spotted too.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.244
Be able to get a visual on our target.

33:07.240 --> 33:08.890
Waiting on confirmation.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.491
That's him. You got him.
The one on your right.

33:14.680 --> 33:16.409
Yeah, actually, he's got me.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.604
<i>I've got him.
He looks pretty heavy, though,</i>

34:02.760 --> 34:04.569
- so <i>I could</i> use a <i>hand.</i>
- I'm on <i>my</i> way.

34:20.480 --> 34:21.641
It's Merida.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.239
Aren't you out
a little bit past your bedtime?

34:29.320 --> 34:31.402
I've seen something
of your fighting style.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.842
You were trained by Ra's al Ghul.

34:34.239 --> 34:37.244
Tell me, how is Malcolm doing these days?

34:41.800 --> 34:43.245
It usually works.

35:01.680 --> 35:04.160
Black Canary's got Andy,
but she needs help reaching the exfil.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.049
- I got this!
- You sure?

35:11.200 --> 35:12.361
Go!

35:24.000 --> 35:26.526
It's, uh, nice of you to show up.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.171
My brother needed me.

35:29.120 --> 35:30.167
The green one.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.725
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, all of you.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.003
- Palmer, even you, thank you.
- My pleasure.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.646
It feels good to do something useful.
It's been a while.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.882
Does that mean
I can expect to see you at work tomorrow?

35:49.080 --> 35:51.082
Ah... No.

35:51.240 --> 35:54.323
I can't keep doing the same useless,
ineffective things, you know?

35:54.480 --> 35:56.005
I gotta do something different.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.642
I'm gonna take some time
and figure out what that is.

35:59.640 --> 36:02.689
But it'll still include the occasional
super-heroics, whenever you need me.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.400
Where are you going?

36:06.600 --> 36:10.047
Well, I have a long overdue chat
with my brother.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.690
I hope you were right.

36:12.440 --> 36:14.442
Me too. You were right.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.090
- About what?
- Darhk.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.410
I thought about what you said,
and how to fight him.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.925
- I'm gonna do it in the light of day.
- Good.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.525
What did you have in mind?

36:21.920 --> 36:23.206
You'll see.

36:28.080 --> 36:31.209
We never should have
gotten on that damn boat.

36:31.520 --> 36:34.922
Reiter's men hijacked a yacht
that we were working on.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.284
I was a dive instructor.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.522
<i>Vlad was a deckhand.</i>

36:41.880 --> 36:45.123
They killed everyone on our charter,
and they brought us here.

36:46.640 --> 36:49.450
What happened? With Vlad.

36:50.400 --> 36:51.561
Conklin.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.804
Taiana, wait. Wait. Listen to me.

36:55.960 --> 36:58.201
- I'm going to kill him for what he did.
- Listen to me.

36:58.400 --> 37:03.122
Conklin is terrible,
but he's not the problem.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.482
- He's just a pawn.
- A pawn for what?

37:06.320 --> 37:07.560
For Reiter's plan.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.446
What is this?

37:11.920 --> 37:14.161
This is a map of Lian Yu.

37:14.320 --> 37:17.563
And I think that it leads to
whatever Reiter is looking for.

37:19.080 --> 37:20.491
Can you follow it?

37:20.960 --> 37:25.170
Not without a detailed
survey map of the island.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.490
Where will we get something like that?

37:29.400 --> 37:31.402
Oh. I had an idea.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.523
It's a long shot, but it's worth a try.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.170
To get there, I'll need your help.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.525
Thank you for coming.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.808
Are you sure you don't have the SCPD
waiting for me in the kitchen?

37:49.200 --> 37:50.690
Don't be so paranoid.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.809
You did threaten me with arrest
the last time I popped by.

38:00.960 --> 38:04.043
So, did you reconsider my advice?

38:04.280 --> 38:05.361
Yes.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.850
But I'm still not gonna take it.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.680
Look, I think I might have found

38:11.840 --> 38:14.650
a different way for me
to control my bloodlust.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.485
One that does not include killing people.

38:18.520 --> 38:19.885
What does it include?

38:21.040 --> 38:22.201
Damien Darhk.

38:27.640 --> 38:32.487
Last night, we went after HIVE,
and I ran into Damien.

38:32.640 --> 38:36.008
I've seen what he can do with his powers.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.323
But when he tried to use them on me,

38:38.480 --> 38:40.084
it completely backfired.

38:42.080 --> 38:44.208
And my bloodlust was gone.

38:44.480 --> 38:46.323
I mean, at least for a little while.

38:46.480 --> 38:48.323
So what I want is for you

38:48.480 --> 38:51.723
to help me figure out a way
to make that permanent.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.764
Andy, I don't even know where to begin.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.851
Andy, I need to understand.

39:17.080 --> 39:18.525
Can you help me understand?

39:19.560 --> 39:21.608
Is what's in this file true?

39:23.960 --> 39:25.291
Andy, answer me.

39:44.480 --> 39:47.927
It's true. All of it.

40:07.240 --> 40:11.928
Boy, this is quite a lot of media for a...
What'd you call it?

40:12.400 --> 40:14.164
- "Hippie-crunchy program."
- That's right.

40:14.400 --> 40:15.925
Always happy to admit when I'm wrong.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.844
- Good luck up there.
- Thank you.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.165
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

40:24.760 --> 40:27.366
You're fine. We're just getting started.

40:27.520 --> 40:32.606
So I haven't been arrested
for battery, yet.

40:33.080 --> 40:37.290
I keep thinking, you would have
killed him if I hadn't stopped you.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.966
I just had a really bad night.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.846
I guess I'm just asking if maybe

40:43.040 --> 40:46.203
you could be a little patient with me?

40:50.880 --> 40:52.120
Thank you all for coming.

40:52.360 --> 40:56.206
My campaign adviser

40:56.360 --> 40:59.011
doesn't think that saving the Bay
is the right fight

40:59.560 --> 41:01.005
given the state the city is in.

41:01.640 --> 41:04.962
But I'd like everyone to know that I'm not
blind to Star City's problems.

41:06.720 --> 41:09.041
And I wouldn't be here today

41:10.160 --> 41:12.891
if I wasn't confident that this program
could help solve them.

41:13.400 --> 41:16.961
And the reason I chose the Bay
is because it's in the center of the city.

41:18.520 --> 41:22.366
It's out in the open, for everyone to see.

41:23.720 --> 41:26.803
The fight to save Star City isn't gonna be
fought in the shadows.

41:28.040 --> 41:29.724
It's gonna be fought in the light of day.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.730
<i>And I promise you,</i>

41:32.160 --> 41:33.400
all of you,

41:35.200 --> 41:38.044
that I will never stop fighting
to save this city.

42:10.440 --> 42:11.441
