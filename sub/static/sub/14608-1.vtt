07:28.323 --> 07:33.284
Yes! It's working! It's on!

07:34.579 --> 07:36.911
Not the battery!

07:42.963 --> 07:44.249

07:44.255 --> 07:47.168

Sorry to trouble you

Well, this island is...

08:09.531 --> 08:14.025
I'm not sure
how you can get here.

I can make it.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.675
I can do this!

10:53.736 --> 10:57.604
It's okay. I can do this!

11:17.177 --> 11:19.464
I can do this...

11:22.765 --> 11:24.096
I can do this...

11:49.209 --> 11:50.199
Dad!

11:50.210 --> 11:53.419
Stop floundering!
That's why you're sinking!

11:53.713 --> 11:56.796
Tread water with your arms.

11:56.799 --> 11:59.587
Everyone else can do it!
Why can't you?

12:00.345 --> 12:03.303
Tread water like the other boys!

12:05.475 --> 12:06.840
<i>Like this!</i>

12:15.068 --> 12:18.732
Aren't you a little old
for this job?

12:18.738 --> 12:20.729
Your TOEIC score's only 700?

12:20.740 --> 12:23.027
Why'd you quit your old job?

12:23.034 --> 12:24.365
The company...

12:26.079 --> 12:27.695

12:29.207 --> 12:30.868
It went bankrupt!

12:32.710 --> 12:33.950

I know, I'm mean.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.468
<i>But hon...</i>

12:51.688 --> 12:56.524
Being mean or incapable,
you know what's worse?

12:59.654 --> 13:00.985
I can't do this.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.898
We're through.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.407

<i>Maybe I should
kill myself after.</i>

16:42.460 --> 16:43.825
<i>Salvia flowers.</i>

16:45.463 --> 16:48.455
<i>I haven 't tried it
in a hundred years.</i>

17:05.358 --> 17:07.019
<i>So sweet.</i>

17:09.028 --> 17:14.194
<i>So sweetml could cry.</i>

18:12.216 --> 18:16.380
<i>I guess I can die anytime later.</i>

18:34.572 --> 18:36.188
It's not so bad.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.156
It's delicious!

18:43.748 --> 18:45.238
The water's great!

18:57.094 --> 19:02.885
<i>Who cares if I die eating this?
That wouldn't be so bad.</i>

19:06.646 --> 19:10.480
<i>Everything's A -aka y.
Life suddenly got easier.</i>

19:22.953 --> 19:24.284
Come on.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.406
Come on!

19:31.295 --> 19:33.411
Just a bit more!

19:34.298 --> 19:38.542
It's working! Yes!

19:38.928 --> 19:40.544
Damn it.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.472
They're all lies.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.891
So boring.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.395
<i>Social Security Card

19:58.406 --> 19:59.988
Are you haPPY?

20:06.372 --> 20:09.706
A delinquent credit card.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.534
Also delinquent.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.744
This one, too.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.873
And this...

20:19.427 --> 20:22.840
A gold delinquent card.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.741
Can't you hear me!

20:55.171 --> 20:57.458
Anyone!

21:19.028 --> 21:21.520
Can't you see me!

21:23.032 --> 21:25.399
Look!

21:25.618 --> 21:31.455
Call this delinquent!

21:31.457 --> 21:33.789
This ain't delinquent!

21:35.336 --> 21:39.170
I'm living fine without
those damn cards!

22:13.541 --> 22:17.455
<i>After 7 years of saving up
for a house...</i>

22:17.461 --> 22:19.793
<i>I finally got my own place.</i>

22:26.929 --> 22:29.136
<i>The duck nestles me.</i>

22:29.807 --> 22:31.969
<i>I am an ugly duckling...</i>

22:32.726 --> 22:34.967
<i>that became a slug
rather than a swan.</i>

22:35.938 --> 22:39.647
<i>Just an ugly duckling...</i>

23:51.597 --> 23:56.262
Almost there!
Just a bit further!

24:09.073 --> 24:12.691
I need some protein, guys.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.362
Gotcha!

24:17.831 --> 24:20.573
Freeze. Don't move.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.825
It'll be over quick and harmless.

24:25.422 --> 24:32.044
How can you all be so selfish!

24:32.054 --> 24:35.342
Shut up bird!

24:36.475 --> 24:38.182
Damn bird!

24:44.066 --> 24:45.477
I'm eating it.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.942
I can do this.

26:12.237 --> 26:19.200
Kentucky Fried Chicken,
'Finger-lickin' good'.

26:19.203 --> 26:22.867
Thanks for droppin' in.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.032
Damn, that's hot.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.379
Hot! Hot!

26:46.563 --> 26:48.975
<i>Birds taste better than fish.</i>

26:51.568 --> 26:56.563
<i>Perhaps evolution is the process
of becoming tastier.</i>

27:14.133 --> 27:16.374
So bored.

27:17.761 --> 27:20.002
<i>Nothing else like it.</i>

27:21.140 --> 27:25.259
<i>The perfect boredom.</i>

28:02.014 --> 28:04.927
<i>'Blue bear' went shopping
yesterday.</i>

28:05.601 --> 28:07.091
<i>Chanel pumps.</i>

<i>Save as.</i>

28:25.913 --> 28:28.826
<i>I bought 'em at the mall.
Aren 't they pretty?</i>

28:30.042 --> 28:32.659
<i>There's no need to go
outside my room.</i>

28:33.337 --> 28:37.422
<i>With a few clicks
everything can be mine, easily.</i>

29:19.758 --> 29:22.750
<i>It doesn't matter
if it's real or not.</i>

29:23.011 --> 29:27.346
<i>The replies on my site
decide that.</i>

29:31.395 --> 29:39.395
<i>Age, looks, jobs...
Anything's possible.</i>

29:53.000 --> 29:54.490
Are you awake?

29:55.377 --> 29:57.414
Do you need anything?

30:00.882 --> 30:02.418
<i>Milk.</i>

30:06.388 --> 30:08.049
Okay.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.927
I'll be a little late, today.

30:12.853 --> 30:18.098
Make sure you eat, okay?

30:37.961 --> 30:41.750
<i>Though I haven 't been out
of my room in 3 years...</i>

30:41.757 --> 30:44.715
<i>I keep strict rules here.</i>

30:49.639 --> 30:52.301
<i>First, I get up
after Dad leaves at 8 a.m.</i>

30:52.309 --> 30:54.300
- Bye, dear.
- I'll be home late.

30:54.311 --> 30:57.975
<i>I get ready, then go outside.</i>

31:09.993 --> 31:12.280
<i>172 calories for breakfast.</i>

31:14.039 --> 31:17.282
<i>I put on 3000 steps
on the pedometer before 9 a.m.</i>

31:20.128 --> 31:21.789
<i>I go to work at 9.</i>

31:26.385 --> 31:27.796
<i>I clean.</i>

31:36.895 --> 31:39.853
<i>I wait to go to the bathroom
till mom leaves at 12!</i>

31:44.528 --> 31:46.940
<i>525 calories for lunch.</i>

31:48.865 --> 31:51.232
<i>I put on 6000 steps to digest.</i>

31:53.161 --> 31:55.198
<i>After some fresh air...</i>

31:55.872 --> 31:58.785
Fresh air.

32:00.085 --> 32:04.704
<i>I plan a new life again
and work at self-impro vement.</i>

32:19.020 --> 32:21.933
<i>After finishing off at work,</i>

32:22.399 --> 32:24.310
<i>I pursue my hobby.</i>

32:29.072 --> 32:31.029
<i>Taking pictures of the moon.</i>

32:38.415 --> 32:40.156
<i>I take pictures of the moon...</i>

32:40.167 --> 32:42.579
<i>cuz there's no one there.</i>

32:43.211 --> 32:47.705
<i>When there's no one,
you can't feel lonely.</i>

32:55.432 --> 32:58.925
<i>Then I put on the last 1000
on my pedometer.</i>

32:59.811 --> 33:02.098
<i>It's not for health reasons.</i>

33:02.230 --> 33:07.191
<i>After putting on 10,000 steps
I feel like I had a good, busy day.</i>

33:12.324 --> 33:14.941
<i>It's an all-too-health y</i>
<i>way of escapism.</i>

33:18.622 --> 33:19.737
- You're home.
- Hi.

33:19.748 --> 33:22.615
<i>I sleep when Dad gets home
at 9 p.m.</i>

33:22.959 --> 33:26.793
<i>Actually, it's hypnotism,
not sleeping.</i>

33:27.005 --> 33:30.623
<i>To erase away the day.</i>

33:31.510 --> 33:34.628
<i>Ana' to start fresh tomorrow.</i>

33:35.555 --> 33:38.673
<i>To be true to each new day.</i>

33:39.684 --> 33:41.595
<i>You 're sleepy.</i>

33:46.691 --> 33:48.898
<i>Once in spring and in the fall...</i>

33:49.152 --> 33:51.985
<i>That day comes just twice a year.</i>

33:52.948 --> 33:54.939
<i>Now, for the countdown!</i>

33:55.408 --> 33:57.775
<i>Relax. Stay calm.</i>

33:59.204 --> 34:00.239
Ten...

34:00.330 --> 34:01.491
<i>Nine...</i>

34:01.665 --> 34:02.826
<i>Eight...</i>

34:02.999 --> 34:04.285

<i>Two...</i>

34:10.005 --> 34:11.087

34:31.027 --> 34:35.146
<i>A tten tion citizens.</i>

34:35.156 --> 34:40.117
<i>This is the Civil Defense Corpsm.</i>

34:42.706 --> 34:44.868
<i>For just 20 minutes a year...</i>

34:45.292 --> 34:50.036
<i>the world seems like
the empty moon.</i>

34:58.430 --> 34:59.545
<i>It feels...</i>

34:59.556 --> 35:02.924
<i>lighter with 1/6th the gravity
like on the moon.</i>

35:08.064 --> 35:11.648
<i>I wish the world would
freeze like this.</i>

35:11.901 --> 35:15.064
<i>So life could be 1/6th lighter...</i>

35:40.680 --> 35:43.092
<i>It? A sign from an alien!</i>

36:20.929 --> 36:25.924
<i>I already tried hypnosis 13 times
but it's no use.</i>

36:26.643 --> 36:31.558
<i>It's not my fault.
I must forget. I can forget.</i>

36:31.815 --> 36:34.147
<i>You 're sleepy.</i>

37:07.016 --> 37:10.600
He's alive! Thank you!

37:34.210 --> 37:38.204
<i>The alien is a freak.</i>

38:35.730 --> 38:39.940
<i>'Help ' changed to 'He/lo '.</i>

39:06.928 --> 39:08.259
Good shot!

40:21.085 --> 40:25.204
<i>Instant black bean noodles</i>

40:45.443 --> 40:47.605
<i>12 grams.</i>

40:48.321 --> 40:50.813
<i>Just cuz of 12 grams.</i>

40:51.908 --> 40:53.398
<i>I crumbled.</i>

40:57.288 --> 41:02.033
Black bean powder, sugar, dextrin,
caramel coloring...

41:02.043 --> 41:03.704
Caramel...

41:04.420 --> 41:09.711
Seasoning, flour,
yummy flavorings...

41:10.093 --> 41:14.007
Damn delicious
Modified Glucosyl Stevia.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.632
Damn. I wanna eat this so badly.

42:00.643 --> 42:02.725
<i>It doesn't have to be wheat.</i>

42:02.812 --> 42:05.144
<i>I don't even expect that much.</i>

42:05.898 --> 42:10.062
<i>If I can make noodles
anything would do.</i>

42:34.886 --> 42:42.725
<i>All the times I was stupid enough
to pass on black bean noodles.</i>

42:43.144 --> 42:45.351
<i>I regret it so much.</i>

42:45.354 --> 42:49.097
Just one bite, dear? Please?

42:49.108 --> 42:51.896
- No.
- Just one bite?

42:51.903 --> 42:55.066
No! No! No!

42:56.365 --> 42:57.855
Eat first.

42:59.702 --> 43:03.866
Eat the noodles first! Stupid!

43:03.873 --> 43:05.989
Black bean noodles, everyone?

43:07.085 --> 43:08.792
Spicy noodles for me.

43:42.912 --> 43:45.950
<i>If I sprinkle this down my mouth...</i>

43:47.291 --> 43:49.828
<i>will the craving go away?</i>

43:53.256 --> 43:56.214
Damn it!

44:02.014 --> 44:05.132
Stop poopifig 9113/5-

44:06.435 --> 44:09.427
Eating and pooping all the time.

44:11.732 --> 44:17.193
That's why you'll always be
just damn birds.

45:01.824 --> 45:03.155
Poop!

45:07.622 --> 45:10.239
Poop! That's it!

45:10.249 --> 45:13.082
That's it! Poop! Poop!

45:13.085 --> 45:16.453
This could work!

45:16.464 --> 45:19.502
Wait, wait, wait!

45:19.508 --> 45:24.002
Think bird brain!
What do birds eat?

45:25.014 --> 45:27.051
That's it!

45:27.058 --> 45:31.518
If they eat and
can't digest the seeds...

45:31.520 --> 45:33.852
What happens to the seeds?

45:34.649 --> 45:36.105
See!

45:36.817 --> 45:42.938
It'll work!
This will definitely work!

45:43.199 --> 45:45.110
Why am I talking to you?

45:46.369 --> 45:50.408
There's definitely a seed
in here somewhere!

45:50.414 --> 45:52.155
Start scraping!

46:03.052 --> 46:05.214
It's working!

46:06.347 --> 46:07.963
This scraps it good!

46:09.225 --> 46:11.557
Finally getting use
out of this card!

46:16.190 --> 46:19.899
It's poop! POOP!

46:33.708 --> 46:36.075
<i>First, I must find good soil.</i>

46:36.168 --> 46:38.910
<i>How can I do that?</i>

46:39.463 --> 46:40.919
<i>Of course.</i>

46:52.518 --> 46:55.101
<i>To make a field,
I have to dig up furrows.</i>

46:55.104 --> 46:56.845
<i>Ana' I also need manure.</i>

46:57.064 --> 46:59.852
<i>Things I need
keep popping into mind!</i>

47:18.419 --> 47:20.786
<i>Desire makes humans smarter.</i>

47:26.302 --> 47:28.213
<i>Always constipation or diarrhea...</i>

47:28.304 --> 47:31.262
<i>When's the last time
I made some good poop?</i>

47:38.189 --> 47:40.226
<i>This can't make good fertilizer.</i>

47:40.316 --> 47:42.148
<i>I have to get healthier.</i>

47:42.151 --> 47:44.483
<i>I must make healthy poop.</i>

47:49.492 --> 47:50.903
<i>And...</i>

47:53.037 --> 47:55.153
<i>I have to make a lot.</i>

48:01.545 --> 48:03.786
<i>Taking dinosaur DNA
from a fossilized</i>

48:03.798 --> 48:06.210
<i>mosquito and
making Jurassic Park...</i>

48:06.217 --> 48:09.960
<i>Or finding a wheat seed in bird poop
and making black bean noodles...</i>

48:10.137 --> 48:12.128
<i>which has the higher probability?</i>

48:13.391 --> 48:15.598
<i>I should hope for a miracle.</i>

48:25.403 --> 48:27.189
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

48:27.780 --> 48:30.192
<i>I got all the time in the world.</i>

49:00.938 --> 49:02.428
<i>It's salty.</i>

49:05.401 --> 49:08.063
<i>I made this salty taste
on my own.</i>

49:09.905 --> 49:12.272
<i>Maybe it's cuz
I ate bland tasting food.</i>

49:12.450 --> 49:15.408
<i>I couldn't be more proud
of my salty tasting se/fi.</i>

49:16.245 --> 49:18.532
<i>I feel like the
most delicious thing</i>

49:18.539 --> 49:21.281
<i>at the top of the
evolutionary chain.</i>

49:21.375 --> 49:24.584
<i>I'm damn delicious.</i>

49:24.587 --> 49:25.952
I'm good!

49:33.345 --> 49:36.929
I know how you feel, bud.

49:37.850 --> 49:40.592
This suit can turn you
into a scarecrow.

49:46.066 --> 49:47.932
No need for this anymore.

50:10.090 --> 50:12.377
<i>85 ¢.</i>

50:19.141 --> 50:22.679
<i>Hope.</i>

50:59.807 --> 51:02.890
<i>I've been watching him
for two months.</i>

51:04.645 --> 51:07.012
<i>This is my mini homepage
of the alien</i>

51:07.022 --> 51:10.060
<i>who can only be seen from my window.</i>

51:13.070 --> 51:17.155
<i>He is shy.</i>

51:18.033 --> 51:19.944
<i>Likes dinfy things.</i>

51:20.202 --> 51:21.863
<i>Enjoys adventures.</i>

51:22.371 --> 51:25.204
<i>He's a total freak.</i>

51:26.375 --> 51:29.413
<i>Ana' he's very curious about
Earth's black bean noodles.</i>

51:31.171 --> 51:33.708
<i>Will I be invited to join...</i>

51:34.717 --> 51:37.379
<i>this lonely alien's world?</i>

51:39.722 --> 51:41.554
<i>I must go out into the Earth.</i>

51:41.640 --> 51:45.133
<i>Can I do it without NASA's help?</i>

51:46.270 --> 51:48.011
<i>Just once.</i>

51:48.105 --> 51:51.063
<i>Only one time.</i>

51:54.278 --> 51:56.645
<i>Representing
the 6 billion people on Earth...</i>

51:56.655 --> 52:02.071
<i>I'll reply to an alien's message.</i>

53:17.653 --> 53:20.190
<i>Since Armstrong...</i>

53:21.031 --> 53:26.492
<i>This is another
giant step for mankind.</i>

53:40.467 --> 53:41.582
<i>Five...</i>

53:41.677 --> 53:42.792
<i>Four...</i>

53:42.886 --> 53:44.126
<i>Three...</i>

53:44.138 --> 53:45.173
<i>Two...</i>

53:45.305 --> 53:46.670
One...

53:46.849 --> 53:48.010
<i>Blast off!</i>

56:17.708 --> 56:19.915
See you later, hon.

56:52.075 --> 56:54.692
<i>Didn't you find the note?</i>

56:56.914 --> 56:59.997
<i>Why aren 't you replying?</i>

57:10.761 --> 57:13.879
<i>Three Months Later.</i>

59:11.298 --> 59:14.336
It's a sprout!

59:15.093 --> 59:18.552
Fast and easy loans like shopping.

59:19.097 --> 59:22.340
Don't lose hope.

59:25.896 --> 59:27.307
Banana flavor.

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:19.291
<i>Don't you think? It's gotta be.</i>

01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:22.960
<i>It has to be meant for me.</i>

01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:26.464
Then why else
would it be there?

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:31.762
It said, 'Hello'.
You know what that means?

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:36.390
Think about it.

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:45.150
It means someone's been
watching me.

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.536
A freak? A psychQ?

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:22.945
<i>After 3 months and 17 days.</i>

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:29.577
<i>I finally got a rep/y.</i>

01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:17.643
<i>The images and sound
are slo w/y getting clearer.</i>

01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:21.312
<i>You 're sleepy.</i>

01:04:57.936 --> 01:05:02.726
That's right, a pen-pal.
Writing to someone you don't know.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:07.067
Then you get curious
and imagine who it might be.

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:10.445
It's an international pen-pal
cuz it's in English.

01:05:11.199 --> 01:05:14.942
But it's the best
when you don't know who it is.

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:18.662
It doesn't matter who it is.
Right?

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:24.827
Hey, pal!
Startin' to ignore me?

01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:29.206
What's wrong?
Going through puberty or somethin'?

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.919
Corn... Corn!

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:14.251
See this?

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:23.685
We can make noodles
with corn powder!

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:31.185
It's corn! Corn!

01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:34.946
Corn!

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:07.972
Yes, hello.

01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:17.943
You know Barn Island on Han River?

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.840
How much for the duck boat?

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.389
Damn it!

01:07:44.185 --> 01:07:47.303
Damn! Why me!

01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:51.685
Hello!

01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:55.397
Anyone here?

01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:15.122
Black bean noodles delivery.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:24.218
Black bean noodles...

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.015
Hey!

01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:48.698
Some woman sent this.

01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:02.510
Regular black bean noodles.

01:09:04.682 --> 01:09:06.298
Black bean noodles with onions.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:09.926
Seafood black bean noodles.

01:09:11.104 --> 01:09:12.765
And this is on the house.

01:09:28.538 --> 01:09:30.779
It's true...

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:34.287
We're supposed to
deliver anywhere.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:37.754
But this is going way overboard.

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:44.466
Enjoy your meal and...

01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:50.140
keep the dishes.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:54.225
Wait!

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:59.230
The woman...

01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:03.655
What does she look like?

01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:09.619
Man, I'd like to see her face, too.

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:25.968
Hey. Wait!

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:58.498
God damn it!

01:11:11.309 --> 01:11:12.891
I don't care!

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:18.396
Deliver it yourself,
eat it, or throw it out!

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:23.731
My legs are all cramped!

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:43.000
Wait!

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:15.946
What's with you two...

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:17.780
<i>That man...</i>

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:23.787
Didn't he say something?

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:25.455
What did he say?

01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:31.879
You two are really somethin'.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:35.466
You're breaking my heart.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:38.013
He told me to tell you...

01:12:38.104 --> 01:12:40.516
a bowl of black bean noodles is...

01:12:41.983 --> 01:12:43.473
hope to him.

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:54.868
I'd stay away from him.
And keep the dishes.

01:13:20.646 --> 01:13:22.057
<i>Hope.</i>

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:25.682
<i>I haven 't heard that
in 100 years.</i>

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:57.510
<i>I'm tasting the giant hope
the man sent me.</i>

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:18.697
<i>It is truly the taste of hope.</i>

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.371
<i>Truly.</i>

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:24.748
<i>Truly.</i>

01:14:44.855 --> 01:14:46.095
Are you awake?

01:14:47.274 --> 01:14:49.265
Do you need anything?

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.157
Then I'll be going, now.

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:16.508
Wait...

01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:23.675
I'd like to raise some corn.

01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:26.894
What?

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:30.314
Corn.

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:34.652
Corn?

01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:41.576
Can you get me the seeds,
pots, and other things?

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:56.671
Sure. I'll get you the corn.

01:17:03.744 --> 01:17:05.360
Me, too.

01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:23.299
How long do I have to
keep doing this?

01:22:03.043 --> 01:22:05.284
Congratulations.

01:24:34.361 --> 01:24:35.851
Hello?

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:40.064
How are you?

01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:44.736
Fine, thank you. And you?

01:24:46.665 --> 01:24:49.077
Fine, thank you.

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:56.422
Where are you from?

01:24:58.677 --> 01:25:01.715
Korean? Really?

01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:03.929
My god!

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:08.101
Me, too! I'm Korean.
From Do-bong-go.

01:25:13.483 --> 01:25:17.477
And... I...

01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:29.746
I hope to see you.

01:25:35.505 --> 01:25:37.246
Who are you?

01:28:07.616 --> 01:28:09.402
What's going on?

01:28:10.619 --> 01:28:12.075
Where is it?

01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:17.785
Where's the bottle?

01:29:44.713 --> 01:29:46.624
<i>This looks familiar.</i>

01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:49.248
<i>That's my friend! Who are you!</i>

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:57.423
<i>This is a fake homepage, people!
I saw the real one!</i>

01:29:57.434 --> 01:29:59.721
<i>Crazy bitch! Die!</i>

01:31:25.772 --> 01:31:27.103
<i>Why...</i>

01:31:30.944 --> 01:31:32.480
Why!

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:37.071
Hey!

01:31:39.744 --> 01:31:42.862
<i>Fierce winds and heavy rainfall
is expected overnight.</i>

01:31:42.872 --> 01:31:46.911
<i>Let's turn to the weather
for the details.</i>

01:31:46.918 --> 01:31:47.953
<i>Reporter HA N?</i>

01:31:47.961 --> 01:31:51.750
<i>A typhoon warning is in effect
in the southeast.</i>

01:32:22.495 --> 01:32:24.862
It's okay! Don't worry!

01:32:25.498 --> 01:32:28.957
It'll pass in a flash!
Don't worry!

01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:32.328
Don't worry!

01:32:38.678 --> 01:32:41.670
Everything will be okay.

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:38.138
I can't even have this?

01:35:41.736 --> 01:35:43.943
It's not much...

01:36:36.916 --> 01:36:44.755
Just about to start, sir.
Don't worry. Bye.

01:36:50.972 --> 01:36:52.303
Who are you?

01:36:53.349 --> 01:36:55.090
What are you doing here?

01:36:56.602 --> 01:36:59.970
You're not allowed to be here, sir.

01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:03.227
Must be homeless, sir.

01:37:10.116 --> 01:37:12.448
We came to clean...

01:37:28.259 --> 01:37:29.465
5120p!

01:37:32.889 --> 01:37:35.096
Stop right there!

01:38:06.798 --> 01:38:08.334
What's going on?

01:38:09.384 --> 01:38:12.718
Catch him! Get him!

01:38:42.667 --> 01:38:44.203
This is my land!

01:38:52.593 --> 01:38:57.554
I have to stay here!

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:00.590
Catch him!

01:39:04.439 --> 01:39:05.929
Bastard!

01:39:19.245 --> 01:39:27.039
This is a conservation area.
It's restricted to the public!

01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:33.416
Let me just stay here, please?

01:39:36.053 --> 01:39:38.215
I won't do anything bad.

01:39:42.226 --> 01:39:44.934
I gotta get the replies.

01:39:48.065 --> 01:39:50.773
Put some clothes on him, first.

01:40:30.358 --> 01:40:32.395
Give it up, mister.

01:40:32.944 --> 01:40:34.309
Let's go.

01:40:34.987 --> 01:40:38.025
Come on! Let's go!

01:43:29.412 --> 01:43:31.403
Let's just go.

01:44:06.490 --> 01:44:08.231
<i>63 Building.</i>

01:45:00.544 --> 01:45:01.750
He's practically Tarzan.

01:45:01.754 --> 01:45:03.119
Like a savage.

01:45:11.722 --> 01:45:13.804
Does this go to the 63 Building?

01:45:49.093 --> 01:45:51.255
Is something up?

01:45:54.723 --> 01:45:58.557
No. Nothing.

01:48:02.768 --> 01:48:06.557
<i>A tten tion citizens!</i>

01:48:06.647 --> 01:48:11.767
<i>This is the Civil Defense Corps.</i>

01:48:11.777 --> 01:48:16.863
<i>Attention citizens!
This is the Civil Defense Corps.</i>

01:48:17.533 --> 01:48:22.778
<i>This is an air-raid drill.</i>

01:48:33.799 --> 01:48:37.383
<i>Once in spring and in the fall.</i>

01:48:38.887 --> 01:48:40.969
<i>That day comes twice a year.</i>

01:49:55.714 --> 01:49:57.671
Something is up.

01:50:27.329 --> 01:50:28.911
"My."

01:50:31.250 --> 01:50:33.036
<i>name is...</i>

01:50:36.004 --> 01:50:38.086
KIM Jung-yeon.

01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:50.466
Who are you?
