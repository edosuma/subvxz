00:06.208 --> 00:09.291
Your son lost my gold to Bob Fink.

00:09.292 --> 00:11.750
Actually, Fink doesn't have it. He's dead.

00:11.792 --> 00:13.250
The safe house on Rivington Street.

00:13.292 --> 00:14.333
Take her to Elm Lodge.

00:14.375 --> 00:15.833
It's a bit close to home, sir.

00:15.875 --> 00:17.559
I don't intend to let this out of my sight.

00:17.583 --> 00:19.458
And he said 30 hours
to this exchange, right?

00:19.500 --> 00:22.292
So that gives us enough time
to track him down, right?

00:22.333 --> 00:25.292
We got three phases... phase one is intel.

00:25.333 --> 00:27.792
Phase two is the takedown.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.583
Phase three is the getaway.

00:30.708 --> 00:31.957
Where's my dad?

00:31.958 --> 00:33.238
He's in the back of Jones's van.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.333 --> 03:22.458
Coming to get you, Vic!
Hang on in there, mate.

03:46.083 --> 03:47.375
Come on, come on!

03:52.250 --> 03:54.083
You piece of shit thing.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.291
Come on, Dad, pick up.

04:03.292 --> 04:05.875
Come on, Dad, don't do this
to me, pick up, pick up.

04:08.292 --> 04:10.250
- Shit.
- He's probably got no signal

04:10.292 --> 04:11.625
in the back of that metal box.

04:11.667 --> 04:14.583
Well, I just hope it's not a metal coffin.

04:36.583 --> 04:38.417
Well, I haven't seen you for a while.

04:48.667 --> 04:50.291
- Albert.
- Mum?

04:50.292 --> 04:52.291
What's going on?

04:52.292 --> 04:53.559
This is all kicked off, Mum, all right?

04:53.583 --> 04:54.792
- We got rumbled.
- And?

04:57.625 --> 04:59.792
Norman got shot, Mum.

04:59.875 --> 05:01.208
He's gone.

05:09.208 --> 05:10.708
God bless him.

05:14.542 --> 05:16.125
Did you get the info on the exchange?

05:16.167 --> 05:18.708
Yeah, we did. It's Liverpool Docks.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.458
The buyer's name is Petru.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.624
He's coming in from some
place called Ajaccio.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.124
He's gotta leave before the morning tide.

05:24.125 --> 05:25.434
We're following Jones in the van now.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.500
We're on our way.

05:26.542 --> 05:27.792
- Albert?
- Yeah?

05:29.125 --> 05:30.292
Where's your father?

05:34.583 --> 05:36.125
I'll give it to them.

05:36.167 --> 05:38.500
They've got some balls
coming after us like that.

05:41.458 --> 05:44.957
This Vic Hill, he's harder
to kill than a cockroach.

05:44.958 --> 05:47.583
Ain't no killing me.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.309
He's a relentless bastard,
I'll give him that.

05:49.333 --> 05:50.917
He almost took us down.

05:50.958 --> 05:53.792
Your boys almost fell
asleep on the job, Dwyer.

05:53.833 --> 05:56.208
Well, at least all that spilt
claret will give your wife

05:56.250 --> 05:59.333
an excuse to redecorate Elm Lodge... again.

05:59.375 --> 06:02.375
Leave the irony to the ironic, Dwyer.

06:02.417 --> 06:06.625
You're engaged solely for
your more... basic instincts.

06:08.208 --> 06:11.500
If the cockroach want
for take over the chicken,

06:11.542 --> 06:13.792
it must hire fox as a henchman.

06:20.625 --> 06:21.792
One minute, girls.

06:47.625 --> 06:49.000
That's badass.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.333
Right. Move it.

06:50.375 --> 06:52.042
Or it's perms all around.

07:11.708 --> 07:13.250
Good boy, Scooter.

07:13.292 --> 07:14.750
Go on, have that.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.083
Al, just wondering...

07:19.125 --> 07:22.833
what exactly are we gonna
do when we get to the docks?

07:22.875 --> 07:25.583
Disruption, extraction, escape.

07:25.625 --> 07:28.542
Yeah, what do each of
those phases entail exactly?

07:28.625 --> 07:31.292
Well, that's the bit I'm
still working on, Charlie.

07:34.042 --> 07:35.500
We getting anywhere, girls?

07:35.542 --> 07:37.500
The Liverpool docks are massive.

07:37.583 --> 07:38.957
12 kilometers long

07:38.958 --> 07:40.434
and 4 million square feet of warehouses.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.000
We need to narrow it down.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.726
Where did Albert say it was departing from?

07:43.750 --> 07:46.250
The Ajaccio, port city on
the west coast of Corsica.

07:46.292 --> 07:47.791
And the buyer's name is Petru.

07:47.792 --> 07:50.625
Petru, a Christian name common in Finland,

07:50.708 --> 07:53.250
- Romania, and Corsica!
- Corsica!

07:53.292 --> 07:55.083
Well, now we know where
it's coming in from.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.393
What we need to find out is
what time and where it's docking.

07:57.417 --> 07:59.250
Three hours till Liverpool.

07:59.292 --> 08:01.083
Doesn't this tin can go any faster?

08:01.125 --> 08:03.143
I'm thrashing her like a nag on
Derby day, Charlie, all right?

08:03.167 --> 08:05.083
You're welcome to get out and push.

08:06.458 --> 08:09.291
Sit. Paw. And spin around for me.

08:09.292 --> 08:11.625
Down.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.125
Who's a good boy?

08:13.167 --> 08:14.375
Sit.

08:14.458 --> 08:17.750
Jesus, this dog can do anything.

08:17.792 --> 08:20.125
I swear, he must be
police-trained or something.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.083
Scooter, away.

08:25.125 --> 08:26.208
Told ya.

08:27.375 --> 08:29.292
He's a good boy, he's a good boy!

08:30.792 --> 08:32.072
Well, that could come in useful.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.375
Shit.

08:45.417 --> 08:46.708
Phone just died.

08:46.750 --> 08:48.750
No worries.

08:48.792 --> 08:50.792
Just by magic, I have another one.

08:50.833 --> 08:53.792
Jesus, Charlie. How
many phones have you got?

08:53.833 --> 08:56.542
No, this is our old pal Bob Fink's.

08:56.625 --> 08:58.375
You stealing a dead man's phone for?

08:58.458 --> 08:59.917
That's a step too far, ain't it?

08:59.958 --> 09:02.500
It's linked to his CCTV
cameras in his flat.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.309
I could use it as
evidence when I sue the ass

09:04.333 --> 09:06.143
out of the metropolitan
police for being kidnapped

09:06.167 --> 09:07.791
and beaten by one of their detectives.

09:07.792 --> 09:10.375
Okay, wait a minute, that
phone is linked to the CCTV

09:10.417 --> 09:12.792
in Fink's flat.

09:12.875 --> 09:15.125
Was it the same flat that
Jones shot and murdered him in?

09:15.208 --> 09:17.542
Well... now that you mention it, yeah.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.101
Well, turn it on then. Let's have a gander.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.375
Yeah.

09:20.417 --> 09:22.417
Shit.

09:22.458 --> 09:24.083
Time to get clever, chaps.

10:18.167 --> 10:20.792
We've got three cracks at
this before it locks us out.

10:20.833 --> 10:22.042
Seven letters.

10:23.625 --> 10:25.083
"Bullion."

10:26.667 --> 10:28.167
- Try "bullion."
- Yeah?

10:28.250 --> 10:30.125
It's a good a guess as any.

10:31.458 --> 10:33.291
Bullion.

10:33.292 --> 10:34.708
Access denied. Two left.

10:36.583 --> 10:38.042
I found a website with all the boats

10:38.083 --> 10:39.833
coming in and out of Liverpool.

10:39.875 --> 10:41.851
It says where they're from and
when and where they're docking.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.417
Any sign of our Corsican friends?

10:43.458 --> 10:44.833
There's hundreds of boats.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.226
This is gonna take ages to go through.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.958
Say the boys actually do boost the money.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
How we going to escape, Lily?

10:51.042 --> 10:53.059
It's not like The Flying
Squad are gonna let us rock off

10:53.083 --> 10:54.708
into the sunset without a fight.

10:54.750 --> 10:57.375
We'll improvise as
opportunities present themselves.

10:57.458 --> 10:59.000
And if option "A" doesn't work,

10:59.042 --> 11:01.625
then there's still 25 other
letters of the alphabet,

11:01.667 --> 11:04.792
- right, Lotti?
- Right, Lily.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.809
All right, so we had a proper
obsession with my old man,

11:06.833 --> 11:08.917
- didn't he? Try his name.
- Worth a shot.

11:08.958 --> 11:12.792
Vic Hill.

11:12.875 --> 11:14.957
Obviously not that obsessed.

11:14.958 --> 11:17.625
Access denied. One left.

11:19.292 --> 11:21.083
You know, if this all goes to plan,

11:21.125 --> 11:23.268
I'll be beating the shit out
of you in a paradise beach

11:23.292 --> 11:24.917
for the rest of our days.

11:26.083 --> 11:27.958
You're becoming needy, Dwyer.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.167
It doesn't suit you.

11:30.208 --> 11:32.875
You're a world-class prick... sir.

11:32.917 --> 11:34.542
Thank you.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.417
Jesus Christ!

11:53.417 --> 11:56.083
Shit! Vic Hill's pet Neanderthal.

11:56.125 --> 11:59.083
I'm beginning to believe that
their obsession with my gold

11:59.125 --> 12:00.583
is bordering on the demented.

12:00.625 --> 12:01.875
I'll put one between his eyes.

12:01.917 --> 12:04.583
No! Let me deal with it.

12:23.167 --> 12:25.791
Nice to see you again.

12:25.792 --> 12:28.000
What did you say your name was?

12:28.083 --> 12:29.624
Them call me Windrush.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.333
Yeah.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.624
And who are you? Hate 'Em All Henry.

12:36.292 --> 12:37.625
Don't forget it.

12:37.708 --> 12:39.208
Respect.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.542
You have to earn my respect.

12:48.833 --> 12:50.625
Come on!

12:50.667 --> 12:52.958
Time to cut up your ass, mate.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.167
Now we're even.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.083
You want this?

13:14.250 --> 13:15.625
This shouldn't take long.

13:25.125 --> 13:28.417
I see your way. Come on...

13:28.458 --> 13:30.833
Come on...

13:31.958 --> 13:34.375
Yah!

13:52.792 --> 13:55.250
Is that it?!

14:04.458 --> 14:05.542
Gotcha!

14:42.875 --> 14:44.208
Shit!

14:44.250 --> 14:47.292
I'm gonna kill ya!

14:57.958 --> 15:00.833
My God!

15:05.125 --> 15:06.957
Last chance to crack it.

15:06.958 --> 15:09.292
Get the ball. Go, Scooter.

15:10.792 --> 15:12.042
Surely not.

15:15.417 --> 15:17.124
Yeah, I got it.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.750
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it worked.

15:18.792 --> 15:19.792
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:19.833 --> 15:21.292
Well done.

15:25.042 --> 15:26.875
Scooter... put that down

15:26.917 --> 15:28.750
before you blow us all up.

15:28.792 --> 15:30.208
Please, put that down.

15:30.250 --> 15:31.708
Billy, what is going on back there?

15:31.750 --> 15:34.250
Good boy, good boy.

15:34.292 --> 15:36.958
Scooter, good boy, good boy.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.792
He only went copped hold of one of these.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.833
Oi!

15:43.417 --> 15:47.458
Billy, how many of those
pineapples you got back there?

15:47.500 --> 15:50.375
I'd say about half a dozen.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.791
Yah!

16:13.417 --> 16:15.125
Aah!

17:28.917 --> 17:30.875
Hey, wait...

17:32.875 --> 17:34.875
Wait.

17:42.167 --> 17:44.167
One last smoke. Hang on, man.

17:50.083 --> 17:53.333
Respect.

17:53.375 --> 17:55.292
Fuck your respect!

18:04.000 --> 18:06.500
Hate 'Em?

18:06.583 --> 18:09.500
Hate 'Em?

18:09.583 --> 18:11.750
You all right, luv?

18:13.375 --> 18:15.125
I could murder a
bacon sandwich, Mrs. H.

18:15.208 --> 18:17.125
Come on, luv, let's get you up?

18:19.667 --> 18:21.708
Hang in there, big fella.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.250
I've got one.

18:23.292 --> 18:24.393
The Panizzi, boat coming in from Corsica.

18:24.417 --> 18:27.167
Registered to a Peter Shryer.

18:27.208 --> 18:29.250
Peter, Petru. It's the same name!

18:29.292 --> 18:30.917
- Yes!
- Just in different countries!

18:30.958 --> 18:32.434
Does it tell you where
it's scheduled to dock?

18:32.458 --> 18:35.208
Pier Nine, Dock Four in an hour.

18:35.292 --> 18:37.957
Right, hold on to your tits, girls.

18:37.958 --> 18:40.208
I've got into the CCTV footage.

18:40.292 --> 18:41.708
- Little agendas.
- Well.

18:41.792 --> 18:43.583
Jeez.

18:43.625 --> 18:44.957
Yeah, all right, I'm not even sure.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.624
Fink deserved to go out like that.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.791
Can you upload that?

18:47.792 --> 18:49.792
Yeah, I can try.

19:01.292 --> 19:03.417
- Mum, what you got?
- Pier nine, dock four.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.417
The Corsicans dock in an hour, Albert.

19:05.458 --> 19:09.125
Okay. Here's the deal.

19:09.167 --> 19:10.875
Text my old man again.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.458
Get him to send me a smoke
signal or something, please.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.500
Quickly.

19:33.625 --> 19:35.750
Yes!

19:35.792 --> 19:38.958
Dad! Dad's all right.

20:57.625 --> 20:59.667
So you boys know what you gotta do?

21:02.708 --> 21:05.167
And you, you're with us now, isn't ya?

21:07.708 --> 21:11.208
All right, well, let's do this, good luck.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.124
Corsicans.

21:27.125 --> 21:30.583
Thank you for stating the obvious, Dwyer.

22:31.250 --> 22:34.458
Chief Superintendent Jones.

22:36.458 --> 22:40.583
Petru.

22:40.625 --> 22:43.917
I see you've brought backup.

22:43.958 --> 22:48.667
We're all gangsters, no?

22:48.708 --> 22:50.792
Even if we hide behind uniforms.

22:50.833 --> 22:54.625
The gold. It is in the van?

22:58.000 --> 22:59.292
It's close by.

22:59.333 --> 23:01.457
But first,

23:01.458 --> 23:03.875
we'll examine the money.

23:03.917 --> 23:05.791
Make sure the ink is dry.

23:07.458 --> 23:10.083
Now this is, English humor?

23:10.125 --> 23:13.625
I prefer to call it English pragmatism.

23:32.625 --> 23:34.333
Well, here goes nothing, then.

24:13.292 --> 24:16.333
Now... ze gold.

24:16.375 --> 24:18.124
Heh!

24:18.125 --> 24:20.417
Ze gold! Ooh la la!

24:24.833 --> 24:27.375
Open the door, Dwyer.

24:35.958 --> 24:37.500
Heads I win...

24:37.542 --> 24:40.875
tails you lose.

24:42.125 --> 24:45.000
Here's Victor!

24:48.417 --> 24:50.042
Don't move.

24:50.125 --> 24:52.291
You lot really do
need a new catchphrase.

24:52.292 --> 24:53.791
All right, all right, all right... oof!

24:53.792 --> 24:56.291
Unh!

24:56.292 --> 24:57.791
No need for hostility.

24:57.792 --> 24:59.583
I come in peace.

24:59.667 --> 25:03.583
You really are a
monumental pain in the ass.

25:03.625 --> 25:07.208
What the hell is this,
Jones? Who's this man?

25:07.250 --> 25:10.250
This man...

25:10.292 --> 25:14.457
is a floater in the toilet of life.

25:14.458 --> 25:16.000
Soon to be flushed.

25:16.042 --> 25:17.417
I bet you a pile of dodgy metal

25:17.458 --> 25:19.583
it all ends in Claret.

25:20.958 --> 25:22.875
Right, Victor.

25:31.208 --> 25:32.791
What now?

25:36.333 --> 25:37.792
What is this, Dwyer?

25:44.792 --> 25:49.583
Un chien, un chien.

25:49.625 --> 25:51.957
What the fuck is this?

25:51.958 --> 25:54.124
No!

25:55.625 --> 25:57.667
- Boss! You okay, boss?
- Fuck! Fuck!

25:57.708 --> 26:00.792
Aah! Unh!

26:02.167 --> 26:05.208
It's a bomb-dog!

26:05.250 --> 26:07.250
It's brilliant.

26:23.667 --> 26:26.500
Now who the hell is this?

26:26.583 --> 26:30.957
Heh! He's my son, Albert.

26:34.292 --> 26:36.042
One more move out of any of you,

26:36.083 --> 26:39.375
and it's Christmas come early, comprende?

26:43.375 --> 26:46.625
Now...

26:46.667 --> 26:48.333
I've just come for me dad.

26:48.375 --> 26:51.000
Bollocks to the gold. You can keep that.

26:51.042 --> 26:53.583
It's all a bluff.

26:53.625 --> 26:55.833
They want it all.

26:55.875 --> 26:59.292
Either I leave with my old man right now,

26:59.333 --> 27:01.333
or we all go up.

27:08.458 --> 27:09.958
No one's going anywhere.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.417
Let him go, you fucking idiot.

27:12.458 --> 27:13.957
There's enough grenades on this mutt

27:13.958 --> 27:15.792
to take out all of us.

27:15.875 --> 27:17.875
Go on.

27:26.125 --> 27:28.708
Put it down.

27:33.333 --> 27:34.917
Get up, Hill!

27:34.958 --> 27:36.458
All right.

27:44.667 --> 27:46.917
Au revoir.

27:54.042 --> 27:56.791
- Trust me?
- All the way, son.

27:56.792 --> 27:58.458
There'll be no rock

27:58.542 --> 28:02.042
big enough for you to hide under.

28:02.083 --> 28:04.000
No, no.

28:04.042 --> 28:05.559
I think it's you that's
gonna need the rock,

28:05.583 --> 28:07.250
Chief Superintendent Jones.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.500
Albert?

28:26.292 --> 28:28.292
You'll pay!

28:56.083 --> 28:57.958
Dad, let's move.

29:05.292 --> 29:06.708
Police, stay down!

29:14.625 --> 29:17.457
The money!

29:17.458 --> 29:19.292
Shit!

29:25.500 --> 29:28.167
Shit!

29:28.208 --> 29:29.542
Go!

29:31.000 --> 29:32.208
Aah!

29:40.333 --> 29:42.458
- In the van, Charlie!
- Fuck!

29:56.750 --> 29:58.000
Start her up, Charlie!

29:58.083 --> 30:00.792
God, no! The van won't start!

30:10.958 --> 30:12.750
Out! To the cop car! Come on!

30:14.042 --> 30:16.208
Come on, come on, Charlie!

30:16.250 --> 30:18.750
Go, go, go-go-go-go!

30:27.125 --> 30:29.167
Come on, Charlie...
just throw it in there!

30:43.042 --> 30:44.417
Get that gun!

30:54.042 --> 30:55.833
- Get in!
- There's no room, Charlie!

30:55.875 --> 30:57.250
How do you suggest we do that?

30:57.292 --> 30:58.875
Charlie, Dock 14, we'll meet you there!

30:58.917 --> 31:00.458
Go, go!

31:02.750 --> 31:05.375
Police, stop, stop!

31:05.458 --> 31:07.624
Aah! Aah!

31:07.625 --> 31:10.333
Around there, boy, around there!

31:15.333 --> 31:17.458
Hit it, Charlie, come on!

31:18.583 --> 31:20.125
Whoa... they're getting away!

31:35.000 --> 31:37.458
Aah! Police!

31:49.458 --> 31:51.167
Shit, they're gaining on us, Charlie!

31:55.458 --> 31:57.167
I said fast!

32:02.625 --> 32:05.624
Forward, ho!

32:09.250 --> 32:11.625
- Aah!
- Aah!

32:13.750 --> 32:14.875
Aah!

32:21.083 --> 32:22.563
Where'd you learn to drive like this?

32:25.792 --> 32:29.042
Reverse, reverse,
Charlie! Come on! Quicker!

32:55.417 --> 32:57.000
They do not give up!

33:00.250 --> 33:01.958
Easy, Charlie!

33:06.458 --> 33:08.208
- Shit!
- Shit!

33:11.167 --> 33:12.542
No!

33:20.917 --> 33:22.292
Aah!

33:24.458 --> 33:26.167
- What do we do now?
- Shit.

33:26.250 --> 33:27.957
Come out of the car with your hands up!

33:27.958 --> 33:30.708
You can pray for a bloody miracle.

33:36.250 --> 33:38.833
- What's that?
- Sh...

33:42.750 --> 33:45.458
Boy, we're really flying now, Charlie!

33:59.292 --> 34:00.375
This is the life.

34:27.250 --> 34:29.667
Hands above your head.

34:29.708 --> 34:33.083
We've been planning this
takedown for months, you idiot.

34:33.125 --> 34:35.042
Chief Superintendent Jones,

34:35.125 --> 34:36.956
I'm arresting you on
suspicion of the murder

34:36.958 --> 34:38.542
of D.I. Robert Fink.

34:40.958 --> 34:42.792
D.I. Fink's murdered?

34:44.958 --> 34:46.456
What are you talking about?

34:46.458 --> 34:49.167
There's a video been sent
anonymously to us, sir.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.583
CCTV footage of Fink's brains

34:51.625 --> 34:54.458
painting the walls, you giving the order.

34:54.542 --> 34:56.458
All these grudges,

34:56.542 --> 35:01.333
these... seedy, little agendas.

35:02.958 --> 35:04.333
Well.

35:05.875 --> 35:07.625
You do not have to say anything,

35:07.667 --> 35:09.907
but it might harm your defense
if you do not mention w...

35:25.417 --> 35:28.457
You really are an animal, Dwyer.

35:28.458 --> 35:31.833
The gold is by the water, sir.

35:47.583 --> 35:49.542
Sailor boy.

36:00.292 --> 36:04.124
What are you doing with my gold, Petru?

36:04.125 --> 36:07.000
It is my gold now.

36:07.083 --> 36:08.625
You son of a...

36:09.792 --> 36:12.000
Don't move, I'll shoot!

36:13.667 --> 36:15.083
Drop your gun.

36:19.292 --> 36:21.125
- Don't be silly, son.
- Drop your guns!

36:22.583 --> 36:24.208
You bastard, sir.

36:45.167 --> 36:48.000
It's been excruciating, Dwyer.

36:56.458 --> 36:59.292
Mum? Dock 14, right now.

36:59.375 --> 37:01.291
We'll be there in a tic.

37:06.958 --> 37:09.917
Oi, son, you don't happen to have

37:09.958 --> 37:11.958
another one of those
grenades handy, do you?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.667
Well, as it happens...

37:26.500 --> 37:28.708
If I can't have you, nobody can.

37:49.042 --> 37:51.208
Chop-chop, chop-chop,
boys, come on.

37:55.083 --> 37:56.667
Move it!

38:34.750 --> 38:36.458
Scooter?

38:37.708 --> 38:40.042
Come on, come on!

38:42.333 --> 38:44.167
Come on!

38:47.792 --> 38:51.208
Couldn't run away, could
you, Scooter? Good boy.

39:04.583 --> 39:07.750
The fat lady sings.

39:19.292 --> 39:21.500
Come on!

39:31.458 --> 39:33.167
Chloe Koen,

39:33.208 --> 39:34.791
I'm gonna kiss you.

39:34.792 --> 39:37.958
Please do, Mr. Canvendish Scott.

39:38.958 --> 39:41.125
Yes!

39:42.417 --> 39:44.957
It's about time, son, about time.

39:47.042 --> 39:49.708
Hey, now you can afford to
take me on a proper date.

39:49.750 --> 39:51.125
You'd be lucky.

39:51.167 --> 39:52.500
Now you're in trouble, son,

39:52.542 --> 39:54.708
now you're in trouble.

39:54.750 --> 39:57.250
Whoo!

39:57.292 --> 39:58.833
I told you I'd sort it, Lil.

39:58.875 --> 40:01.625
I never doubted
you for a minute, Victor.

40:57.958 --> 41:01.124
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.292
There's still one more
thing we need to sort out.

41:08.292 --> 41:10.125
Who knows the way to Spain?

41:15.042 --> 41:16.458
We're going to Spain, baby!

41:18.833 --> 41:20.292
Whoo!
