WEBVTT

00:07.440 --> 00:09.329
There's a killer on the loose,
and I'm sitting here waiting

00:09.480 --> 00:11.289
for this decomposed hand
to lead me to him.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.442
( Tires screech )

00:15.360 --> 00:17.203
( roars )

00:17.360 --> 00:19.931
Ruby!

00:20.120 --> 00:22.122
Ash:
All roads to destroying this evil

00:22.280 --> 00:25.363
lead right back to where
it all began, the cabin.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.124
Then let's go back there
and end it all.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.327
You can't go with me.

00:28.480 --> 00:29.970
I've put your lives
in too much danger already.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.610
- Ash?
- Lem...

00:31.800 --> 00:33.848
I'm really getting my life together.
Even joined a militia.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.206
- Where's your camp?
- I got him.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.283
Don't do anything till I get there.

00:37.440 --> 00:38.771
State police!

00:49.280 --> 00:50.327
Aah!

00:50.480 --> 00:51.641
- Come with us.
- Where to?

00:51.800 --> 00:53.404
To fight.
Let's boogie.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.685
I still don't know how I feel

01:25.840 --> 01:27.524
about you guys
coming to the cabin.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.842
I guess if you're dead set on it...

01:30.000 --> 01:31.650
Pablo:
"Dead set"?

01:31.800 --> 01:33.450
Let's say "live set."
Keep it upbeat.

01:33.600 --> 01:34.840
Exactly.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.843
We're not leaving a trail
of blood and guts behind us.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.401
We're keeping Michigan moist.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.528
We're coming
to this cabin with you.

01:41.680 --> 01:42.761
We're basically family now.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.206
I know.
That's the problem.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.840
Everyone I have feelings for
dies there.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.530
But you're adults.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.887
We'll go see Lem,
get some big-boy toys,

01:51.040 --> 01:52.201
- go to the cabin.
- Good.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.521
Because anything's
better than this.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.206
Don't worry, Annie Oakley.
You'll get your gun.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.522
- I want a flamethrower.
- ( Pablo chuckles )

01:58.720 --> 01:59.881
I'm serious!

02:00.040 --> 02:01.724
I lost my parents,
got possessed--

02:01.880 --> 02:03.370
flamethrower seems fair.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.562
Yeah, well,
you are pretty fiery.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.563
Okay, listen,
some friendly advice.

02:07.720 --> 02:09.722
These militia types
are a little twitchy.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.564
Oh, I know these kind of people.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.051
Paranoid rednecks
who hit the woods

02:13.200 --> 02:14.690
to play Rambo
for the weekend.

02:14.840 --> 02:15.887
Okay, now, easy.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.565
We don't want another
Ruby Ridge on our hands.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.564
So just tuck that attitude
right into your cleavage,

02:20.720 --> 02:22.688
which I definitely have not
ever noticed before.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.730
- Wow.
- ( man rasping )

02:26.720 --> 02:28.404
Man:
Help.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.248
Help!

02:32.400 --> 02:34.084
Someone...

02:35.560 --> 02:37.244
Someone...

02:40.760 --> 02:42.410
Someone...

02:42.560 --> 02:44.085
Holy shit.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.604
( Man panting )

02:52.440 --> 02:54.602
- He's here.
- Who's here?

02:54.760 --> 02:57.604
Him. He tore
the whole place apart.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.000
Amanda:
Okay, you're in shock.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.650
We need to stop
the blood flow.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.450
' ( Ma“ grunts)
<i>'</i> ( gasps)

03:02.600 --> 03:05.729
- Please, just kill me.
- Ash: Easy, pal.

03:05.880 --> 03:06.927
We're not going to kill anybody.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.966
- We'll get you all fixed up.
- Okay, first things first.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.281
Man:
Get away from him!

03:12.440 --> 03:14.602
He's one of those things, isn't he?
He's one of those things!

03:15.600 --> 03:17.728
( Music playing )

03:30.800 --> 03:32.689
So...

03:32.840 --> 03:34.649
who the fuck are you guys

03:34.800 --> 03:36.802
and why are you roaming
around my camp?

03:36.960 --> 03:38.769
First off, apologies.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.490
I guess we caught you guys

03:40.640 --> 03:42.563
at something of
an inconvenient time.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.007
We're just looking for Lem.
He said he could help us out.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.328
- You know Lem?
- Oh, I know Lem.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.960
Yeah, he's a good friend of mine.
I just saw him at the diner.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.640
- He invited us here.
- I've met you before.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.007
- Where you from?
- Me?

03:56.160 --> 03:57.844
- Nowhere near here.
- ( scuttling )

03:58.000 --> 03:59.081
- Fuck!
- ( roaring )

03:59.240 --> 04:00.480
- Where is he?
- The roof!

04:00.640 --> 04:02.165
He's back!

04:02.320 --> 04:04.846
Uh, who's "he"?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.844
- Lem.
- "Lem" Lem?

04:08.000 --> 04:11.846
He got back to the camp
about an hour ago.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.207
At first I thought
he was drinking again.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.523
Then he started
tearing people apart.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.841
Oh, boy.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.286
Man: His eyes were all
white and crazy.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.851
He looked like
a fucking monster.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.367
- Of course he did.
- ( clatter)

04:24.520 --> 04:26.682
Keep your weapons
trained on the roof.

04:26.840 --> 04:27.921
( Scuttling )

04:28.120 --> 04:29.201
We got to get
the hell out of here.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.727
I wouldn't be roaming around
anywhere if I were you.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.166
What the hell do you know?

04:33.320 --> 04:35.687
Let me dumb it down for you.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.649
What's out there
knows that you're alive,

04:37.800 --> 04:40.565
and it wants you
to be un-alive.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.404
( Scuttling )

04:44.720 --> 04:48.566
I know exactly
what we're dealing with.

04:48.760 --> 04:51.081
Big Brother put a virus
in our air supply,

04:51.240 --> 04:52.890
turned Lem into
some sort of mummy!

04:53.040 --> 04:55.202
- That's a new one.
- Yeah, but we were ready for it.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.567
Were you? Okay. Wow.

04:57.720 --> 05:00.485
You guys are survivalists.
Here's how you survive.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.291
Give us our weapons back
and get the fuck out of our way.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.727
Lem:
I'm going to get you.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.723
Oh, why don't you come out,

05:07.880 --> 05:09.928
you motherfucking
piece of shit?

05:10.120 --> 05:13.283
Come on!
I'll kill you myself.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.363
Probably not the best idea, Kel.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.565
( Rasping )

05:18.720 --> 05:22.930
Yeah.
That's what I thought.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.731
That's how I know you.
You was at the lockup

05:25.880 --> 05:27.405
when I was tossed in
a few years ago.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.766
She's a cop!

05:28.920 --> 05:32.242
So who the fuck
are you guys, really, huh?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.604
Are you the government?

05:35.760 --> 05:37.922
You were the last people
to see Lem.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.764
What are you, huh?

05:40.920 --> 05:43.161
Checking in to see
if your little experiment worked?

05:43.360 --> 05:45.044
What did you do to him?
You tell me!

05:45.200 --> 05:46.804
- What did you do to Lem?
- Back off.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.042
- What did you say?
- Man: Watch your six!

06:05.120 --> 06:07.282
I would stay away from there
if I were you.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.283
Not looking for your input,
tough guy.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.440
See?

06:25.800 --> 06:27.040
- It's perf--
- ( Lem roars )

06:27.240 --> 06:29.004
( shouting )

06:29.200 --> 06:31.851
- ( man screaming )
- ( shouting )

06:33.920 --> 06:35.331
We need to get
the fuck out of here.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.569
You ain't going nowhere.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.800
( Both grunting )

06:50.960 --> 06:53.008
Man:
Enjoy.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.845
Maybe your old friend Lem
will find you down there.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.330
( Lem growls )

07:00.520 --> 07:02.761
- Amanda: What was that?
- Ash: You know what that was.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.365
Man:
There's two more we got to get!

07:04.520 --> 07:05.760
Let's load up and go!

07:05.920 --> 07:07.524
Man #2:
Let's move it up!

07:07.680 --> 07:09.762
- Shit.
- Man: Yeah!

07:09.920 --> 07:12.002
We got to figure out a way
to get them out of there.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.761
- ( Radio chatter)
- ( engines revving )

07:15.920 --> 07:18.048
- Man: Over there!
- Come on. Let's move.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.531
- Shit.
- Let's go.

07:19.680 --> 07:20.806
Shh, shh.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.365
Amanda:
Whoa, watch it.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.682
Ash: Hold on.
I'm trying something here.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.360
Hey!

07:27.520 --> 07:29.204
It works!

07:29.360 --> 07:31.044
You think there's another exit door?

07:31.200 --> 07:34.363
No, but I'll say yes
just to keep hope alive.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.363
Let's check it out.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.564
Amanda:
Oh.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.882
A week ago I was having
a burger with my partner,

07:50.040 --> 07:53.044
and now everything
is upside down.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.050
Took me a long time
to get my head around it, too.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.571
But you're seeing the world
as it really is,

07:57.720 --> 07:59.245
so that's good.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.561
Doesn't feel good.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.564
Most people go through life
thinking they're totally safe.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.802
People like us,
we know the truth.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.081
Life is hard and dangerous,

08:07.240 --> 08:08.571
and sometimes
you just got to chop off

08:08.720 --> 08:10.927
somebody's head to survive.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.560
<i>I guess.</i>
I <i>guess that's</i> true.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.922
But, hey,
this ain't so bad.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.241
We get to spend
some quality time

08:17.400 --> 08:18.925
like you been dreaming about.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.401
You think this is the right time
for hitting on me?

08:21.600 --> 08:24.080
There's no bad time.
I'm old-school, baby.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.446
Oh, you're old something.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.364
( Clatter)

08:31.440 --> 08:35.445
Hey, I'm sorry I misread you.

08:35.600 --> 08:36.760
The woman I was with,
she told me

08:36.919 --> 08:39.764
that she thought you were
the one making those--

08:39.919 --> 08:41.842
- those things.
- Who is this woman?

08:42.039 --> 08:44.850
Her name was Ruby.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.728
She was a lot like you, actually.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.605
She spent her whole life
fighting those freaks.

08:53.440 --> 08:55.124
It finally caught up to her.

08:58.640 --> 08:59.721
Just a normal person

08:59.880 --> 09:03.123
who got tangled up into something
that was so much bigger.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.202
Something beyond her control.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.486
I will always be thankful
she was honest with me.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.484
She taught me
there is more out there

09:26.640 --> 09:27.801
than any of us realize.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.490
( Lem roars )

09:29.640 --> 09:30.846
What was that?

09:42.840 --> 09:44.171
'(thud)
<i>'</i> ( gasps )

09:52.000 --> 09:54.571
( panting, growls )

09:54.720 --> 09:57.690
( men shouting )

10:00.880 --> 10:04.362
( men shouting )

10:04.520 --> 10:06.841
- Kelly: Fuck.
- We'll be okay.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.010
Man:
Go, go!

10:26.720 --> 10:28.722
Hello, Ash.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.211
Good to see you again.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.203
Wish I could say
the same, Lem.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.568
You never wanted
to drink with me, Ash.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.405
You said I was a bad drunk.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.562
That I liked the firewater.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.563
That was before I knew
it was racist.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.245
That was a long time ago.

10:45.400 --> 10:49.564
Well, maybe
you'll drink with me now.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.085
What the hell was that?
No big deal.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.526
Just a little kerosene.

10:54.880 --> 10:55.927
- Lem, don't--
- Cheers.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.684
Don't-- Jesus!

10:57.880 --> 10:59.086
( Lem growls )

11:00.080 --> 11:02.765
I'm going to get you!

11:06.400 --> 11:08.050
( Growls )

11:10.080 --> 11:13.163
Where did you go?

11:17.600 --> 11:19.648
Why'd you pick
flamethrower so easily?

11:19.800 --> 11:21.609
What?

11:21.760 --> 11:23.603
Earlier you said
you wanted a flamethrower,

11:23.760 --> 11:25.285
just like that.

11:25.440 --> 11:29.126
Man, it's like you know
exactly who you are.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.044
Are you having a meltdown?

11:31.200 --> 11:33.771
What? No.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.122
I'm-- it's just...

11:38.320 --> 11:39.526
Who am I?

11:42.120 --> 11:43.804
Who are you?

11:43.960 --> 11:47.806
You are a good friend.
Someone who makes cool--

11:47.960 --> 11:49.803
What? No.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.804
What I'm asking is,
am I, like, an axe guy

11:52.960 --> 11:55.804
or somebody who uses
a crossbow?

11:55.960 --> 11:57.610
Maybe I'm a Taser kind of guy.

11:57.760 --> 12:01.321
Or, I don't know,
a rusty chain?

12:02.800 --> 12:05.485
You know,
I used a gun at the diner.

12:05.640 --> 12:06.801
Felt kind of small.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.325
You know what?

12:08.480 --> 12:10.164
I'm glad that being
trapped in the woods,

12:10.320 --> 12:12.482
hunted by an insane militia

12:12.640 --> 12:14.608
made you ask

Man:
Meet you by the crick.

12:48.200 --> 12:52.046
Look, they separated.
That's good, that's good.

Nice try.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.602
( Kelly groans )

14:26.600 --> 14:27.965
I'm going to get you pregnant later.

14:28.120 --> 14:31.124
Won't your sister be
jealous of us?

14:34.640 --> 14:36.130
Uncle Sam will never outsmart

14:36.280 --> 14:38.123
a couple of deep woods
Michigan boys.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.681
We're not with Uncle Sam,
you fucking knob.

14:40.840 --> 14:41.921
We're on the same side.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.402
- Save your lies, Hillary.
- Pablo: Hey! You fucking moron.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.291
This has nothing to do
with the government.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.442
There is something evil out there!

14:50.600 --> 14:51.806
Oh, I know all about
the evil out there.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.327
It's not the government!

Lance?

14:57.800 --> 14:58.881
It's me!

Hey.
Nice driving.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.725
Thanks.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.406
So, maybe...

16:10.560 --> 16:13.245
I'm a pickup truck kind of guy.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.402
Yeah, maybe.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.881
Oh.

Hello, handsome.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.048
Okay.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.247
So what's the plan?

16:25.400 --> 16:28.290
You're going to get
that guy's gas mask.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.966
We're going to ambush
these hicks and save Ash.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.930
- Um, that mask?
- Yeah, it's the only one around.

16:34.080 --> 16:37.482
Uh...
do you really think I need one?

16:37.680 --> 16:39.091
In order for this plan
to work, yeah.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.288
Because you need
to be in disguise.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.807
Look, I'll clean the blood off
with my shirt, okay?

16:46.080 --> 16:47.764
Yeah, no, no. I got this.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.285

Look, it's a process, okay?
I'm getting there.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.521
Jeez. You know,
I've been through a lot.

It's not my fault!

17:36.320 --> 17:38.926
Whose fault is it?

17:40.440 --> 17:42.647
- It's the gun's fault.
- ( gunfire )

17:43.640 --> 17:45.244
These things are dangerous.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.326
I've got an idea.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.891
But you're going to
have to follow my lead.

I like a lady
who takes charge.

Where the hell is everybody?

- Right here, asshole.
- Man: What?

20:47.360 --> 20:48.850
Safety last.

( Chuckles )

20:54.040 --> 20:55.371
Well, that was fun.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.961
We should get handcuffed
together more often.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.804
You wouldn't even know
what to do with me.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.007
Oh, honey bunny,

21:01.160 --> 21:03.527
I would destroy you
in the best possible way.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.841
Mmm.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.206
You know, I was going to
take that propane

21:06.360 --> 21:07.691
and blow the doors off,

21:07.840 --> 21:10.525
but I'll happily blow
your doors off first.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.045
Really?

21:17.680 --> 21:19.682

Ash! Fisher!

21:20.880 --> 21:23.326
Kelly:
Are you alive in there?

21:23.480 --> 21:26.086
- Rain check.
- Oh.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.729
Yeah, fuck a flamethrower.

This guy has got girth.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.723
Oh, yeah.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.406
I think I found
my own boomstick.

- Shit. My bad.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.564
Uh, yeah.
You know what?

21:58.720 --> 22:01.246
I think a gun might be better.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.800
Looks good on you.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.766
Save those cuffs, baby.
We'll use them later.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.524
It never turns off with you,
does it?

22:15.680 --> 22:18.251
Babycakes, I don't know
how to turn it off.

everybody's on the same side.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.442
Hey, go ahead
and cut yourself free.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.443
I'd get as far away
from here as possible.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.442
So, we hitting

Keep if UP-

23:14.320 --> 23:15.651

too much kerosene.
