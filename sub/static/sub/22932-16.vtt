00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:11.500 --> 00:12.920
Harley, you're too kind.

00:12.920 --> 00:14.420
And how about another
bowl for my friend?

00:14.420 --> 00:16.540
I like mine
with extra butter.

00:16.540 --> 00:19.170
And replace the popcorn
with macaroni and cheese.

00:19.170 --> 00:22.420
That's for Aidan,
he's coming over to watch TV.

00:22.420 --> 00:23.960
Go find someone else to annoy.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.710
If you need suggestions,
Ethan's upstairs.

00:25.710 --> 00:28.000
Why do you think
we're down here?

00:28.000 --> 00:30.920
You know, we're getting tired
of you always kicking us out

00:30.920 --> 00:32.920
every time Aidan comes over.

00:32.920 --> 00:36.080
Especially when you combine
that with all the other
times you kicked us out.

00:36.080 --> 00:39.170
I'm sorry we helped convince
you to hang out with that guy.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.170
Well, it turned out
to be great advice.

00:41.170 --> 00:43.170
I have new found respect
for you two.

00:43.170 --> 00:45.500
-[Aidan]  Hi, Harley!
-Get out!

00:45.500 --> 00:47.500
Go, monkeys, go!

00:50.790 --> 00:52.540
So, what are we watching?

00:52.540 --> 00:56.580
Well, since yesterday
you sat through the
"Shouty Housewives" with me,

00:56.580 --> 00:59.380
I'm going to watch
the first season of
"Ow, That Hurts!" with you.

00:59.380 --> 01:01.580
See, it's things like that
that have made

01:01.580 --> 01:03.170
these past couple weeks
so special.

01:03.170 --> 01:05.670
Speaking of special,
I got you something.

01:07.080 --> 01:10.580
My first gift from a boy
whose last name isn't Diaz.

01:10.580 --> 01:12.750
It's probably flowers,
or candy,

01:12.750 --> 01:14.670
or a charm bracelet.

01:14.670 --> 01:17.540
Which reaction says
"I really love it" most?

01:17.540 --> 01:21.540
Combination gasp and aww?
[gasp] Aww!

01:21.540 --> 01:23.620
Or should I get emotional?

01:23.620 --> 01:26.460
Can't find the words?

01:26.460 --> 01:29.420
Yes, that's the one.

01:33.540 --> 01:35.500
You got me a wrench?

01:35.500 --> 01:37.620
I can't find the words.

01:37.620 --> 01:40.540
I really can't find
the words.

01:40.540 --> 01:42.540
The other day you were working
on your mini-sea drone

01:42.540 --> 01:44.750
and couldn't finish
because you needed a wrench
with extra reach.

01:44.750 --> 01:46.500
-You remembered?
-Yup.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.500
This is made
of a tungsten alloy.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.710
Your favorite.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.620
it's got
a slip-resistant handle,

01:51.620 --> 01:53.880
and a tapered jaw
for work in tight spaces.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.790
I couldn't find
anything for that.

01:55.790 --> 01:59.170
I tracked down some guy
in Canada who makes
his own tools.

01:59.170 --> 02:01.620
He also makes personalized
pliers, if that's your thing.

02:03.710 --> 02:07.580
Aidan, this gift...

02:07.580 --> 02:09.710
I really, really can't
find the words.

02:09.710 --> 02:13.250
Aidan got me this
and all I got him
was a bowl of popcorn

02:13.250 --> 02:15.120
that Lewie and Beast
had pawed over.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.670
A wrench?

02:16.670 --> 02:18.710
Can I take a picture of that
and send it to Chloe?

02:18.710 --> 02:21.580
She'll think the ping-pong net
I got her isn't so bad.

02:21.580 --> 02:23.540
Don't you get it?

02:23.540 --> 02:25.210
This is the perfect gift
for me.

02:25.210 --> 02:28.790
Somehow, Aidan knew what
I needed even more than I did.

02:28.790 --> 02:30.750
Now I have to get him something
just as thoughtful.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.580
Is that what Chloe expects?

02:32.580 --> 02:34.290
Ugh.
Maybe we should break up.

02:34.290 --> 02:36.880
Why did Aidan have to nail it
on the first try?

02:36.880 --> 02:39.250
I could kill that wrench guy
in Canada.

02:39.250 --> 02:42.000
Come on, you're the one
who always makes Mom

02:42.000 --> 02:44.250
the perfect Mother's Day gift.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.000
Remember that one year,
you lost the car

02:46.000 --> 02:47.710
and still had her
crying tears of joy?

02:47.710 --> 02:49.040
That's it!

02:49.040 --> 02:50.750
I'll make him a gift.

02:50.750 --> 02:53.040
I just have to figure out
what he'd want.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.080
While you're at it,
can you make something
to give Chloe?

02:58.040 --> 02:59.290
Here.

02:59.290 --> 03:01.830
-A flipper?
-You got her a ping pong net.

03:01.830 --> 03:03.670

Okay, Aidan's first
gift to me was great,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.830
but wait until he sees
what I got for him.

04:05.830 --> 04:08.830
It's personal, unique,
and I made it myself.

04:08.830 --> 04:11.040
Winner? Harley.

04:12.290 --> 04:14.920
Not that gift-giving
is a competition,

04:14.920 --> 04:17.120
though, you know,
it kind of is.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.750
Hey.

04:19.750 --> 04:23.290
I got your text to
"meet me at the swing-sweat."

04:23.290 --> 04:25.620
Good thing I speak
auto-correct.

04:25.620 --> 04:26.920
What's this?

04:26.920 --> 04:29.290
I was thinking about
how awesome your gift was,

04:29.290 --> 04:32.000
so I wanted to get
a little something for you.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.250
And as you might
know this by now,

04:33.250 --> 04:34.880
but I don't do
"little" anything.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.830
Whoa, first gift.

04:36.830 --> 04:39.120
Warning:
I might get emotional.

04:40.750 --> 04:41.960
Ta-da.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.210
It's our announcement
booth at school.

04:44.210 --> 04:45.750
Those two are us.

04:45.750 --> 04:46.960
Oh, check this out...

04:46.960 --> 04:49.040
[Harley's voice]
You are the worst!

04:49.040 --> 04:52.420
You're rude, self-centered,
obnoxious, rude.

04:52.420 --> 04:54.790
Did I say rude twice?
Yeah.

04:54.790 --> 04:57.380
That's because you're twice
as rude as anyone I ever met!

04:57.380 --> 04:59.920
[chuckling]
It's funny, right?

04:59.920 --> 05:02.040
The audio was easier
to get than you'd expect.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.920
Turns out, most of the school
recorded it.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.880
Um, yeah.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.330
It's very...
detailed.

05:09.330 --> 05:12.170
Why exactly would you want
to remember this moment?

05:12.170 --> 05:15.880
Because it shows
how far we've come.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.880
We can laugh about it now.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.380
It's funny, right?

05:21.040 --> 05:24.040
Well, he got emotional,

05:24.040 --> 05:27.880
just not exactly the emotion
I was hoping for. [sighs]

05:32.380 --> 05:36.380
You know Mom and Georgie
already left for that dance
competition, right?

05:36.380 --> 05:39.120
I thought you'd be plopped
on the couch, watching TV.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.920
First, I have to do
one thing for Mom--

05:40.920 --> 05:43.880
secure these frames
and her decoupaged plate

05:43.880 --> 05:45.120
to the shelves.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.210
Nice.

05:46.210 --> 05:48.120
So the one clean plate
in the house,

05:48.120 --> 05:49.210
you want to hang up
on the wall?

05:49.210 --> 05:50.960
Your mom's not even home.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.250
We can eat out
of coffee mugs.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.880
Doing this isn't
gonna take long.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.420
After that, it's Dad TV.

05:55.420 --> 05:57.960
No British accents,
no brides choosing dresses.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.380
It's apes on horseback,
carrying swords,
blowing things up.

06:01.380 --> 06:02.960
Congratulations!

06:02.960 --> 06:06.210
One of you lucky dogs gets
to take us to laser tag.

06:06.210 --> 06:08.380
Sorry, can't.
I'm...

06:08.380 --> 06:11.040
doing something
that's not that.

06:12.250 --> 06:15.040
Alright, Dad.
Grab the keys, let's go.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.040
I can't either.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.250
Doing a big project
for mom.

06:17.250 --> 06:18.750
Going to take most
of the day.

06:18.750 --> 06:19.960
Save it, Dad.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.330
We know "Medieval Monkey Wars"
is on TV today.

06:22.330 --> 06:24.750
Look, I took you
to laser tag last week,

06:24.750 --> 06:25.880
and it cost me 90 bucks.

06:25.880 --> 06:26.960
When you have that much,
we'll talk.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.120
Okay. Can we borrow 90 bucks?

06:30.120 --> 06:32.120
No.
Two reasons.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.920
One, I don't have it.

06:33.920 --> 06:37.040
Also, this a great
opportunity for you guys
to make your own money.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.380
Business ideas, go.

06:38.380 --> 06:40.380
Golf ball retrievers.
Pro athletes.

06:40.380 --> 06:44.040
Live mannequins
in a children's dress shop!

06:44.040 --> 06:45.460
Selling brownies.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.040
Lots of good stuff here.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.830
Let's focus on the brownies.

06:48.830 --> 06:50.210
There you go!

06:50.210 --> 06:52.080
You'll get that 90 bucks...

06:52.080 --> 06:53.170
...in about a month.

06:53.170 --> 06:56.290
See you shortly,
Sir Monkey the Exploder.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.210
I don't think you're seeing
how funny this is.

07:00.210 --> 07:01.960
Let me get
to the best part.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.170
[Harley's voice]
Drumming on the desk!

07:03.170 --> 07:04.330
Drumming on the fence!

07:04.330 --> 07:06.500
Drum drum drum drum
drum drum drum!

07:06.500 --> 07:08.920
I sound crazy, right?
It's hilarious!

07:08.920 --> 07:11.170
Usually, you only say
"drum" like once,

07:11.170 --> 07:13.380
but I said it, like,
a whole bunch of times!

07:13.380 --> 07:15.210
You sure did.

07:15.210 --> 07:16.330
If I wanted to remember
this moment,

07:16.330 --> 07:18.330
this is totally
the best version.

07:18.330 --> 07:22.420
It accurately depicts
what is forever seared
into my mind.

07:22.420 --> 07:24.830
You're right.

07:24.830 --> 07:27.920
I was trying to be clever
and cute and personal,

07:27.920 --> 07:29.920
but this is terrible.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.380
I'm sorry.

07:31.380 --> 07:33.120
No, come on.
It's really...

07:33.120 --> 07:34.330
great.

07:34.330 --> 07:37.420
Plus, I didn't have to worry
about getting emotional.

07:37.420 --> 07:39.210
So... wins all around.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.460
We blew it.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.120
I need a do-over,

07:43.120 --> 07:45.250
but I don't know him
well enough to do a do-over.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.460
What do I do?

07:46.460 --> 07:49.120
First I need
to stop saying "do."

07:49.120 --> 07:52.210
Then I have to figure out
his perfect gift, and fast.

07:52.210 --> 07:55.080
His birthday is right
around the corner...

07:55.080 --> 07:57.080
I think.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.250
Yeah, I've really got
to get to know this guy.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.460
Check it out.

08:11.460 --> 08:14.170
Oh no, is Harley
counterfeiting now?

08:14.170 --> 08:16.040
That seems like
a line-cross.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.500
A lady came and bought
all our brownies.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.380
She said we were so cute.

08:20.380 --> 08:22.040
That was my contribution.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.210
She was looking at me.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.210
A hundred bucks
for brownies?

08:25.210 --> 08:28.960
She made us promise
when we grew up and saw
some kids selling brownies,

08:28.960 --> 08:30.330
we'd do the same thing.

08:30.330 --> 08:34.170
[laughing]
Yeah, like that's
gonna happen.

08:34.170 --> 08:37.420
So you can take us
to laser tag now.

08:37.420 --> 08:39.290
And if you get us
there fast,

08:39.290 --> 08:41.880
we will buy you dinner.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.540
All right,
deal's a deal.

08:43.540 --> 08:45.210
As soon as I hang
Mom's plate.

08:45.210 --> 08:47.120
Which I can't
seem to find.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.380
I left it right here.

08:52.380 --> 08:54.420
First time making brownies,

08:54.420 --> 08:56.500
and they're way better
than Mom's.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.460
Either we're great
or she's terrible.

08:59.460 --> 09:01.040
Right?

09:01.040 --> 09:03.120
[gasps]
You guys ate too many.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.210
Now this doesn't look full.

09:24.420 --> 09:25.500
Where's the plate now?

09:25.500 --> 09:28.540
I guess we sold it
with the brownies.

09:28.540 --> 09:31.960
When a lady flashes a Benjamin,
you don't think details.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.210
Guys, Mom made that plate.

09:34.210 --> 09:37.040
She's going to be furious.
You have to get it back.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.210
Okay.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.460
We'll just check our paperwork

09:39.460 --> 09:42.120
to see what that lady put down
as her forwarding address.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.620
-We took that?
-Of course not!

09:43.620 --> 09:46.290
So you're telling me
we lost Mom's plate?!

09:46.290 --> 09:48.080
-What are we going to do?
-We?

09:48.080 --> 09:50.290
You're the one who left it where
us Littles could touch it.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.330
Everyone knows
we're a menace.

09:52.330 --> 09:55.290
Which is also your fault.
You raised us.

09:55.290 --> 09:58.040
Okay, so discipline
starts now.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.330
No one's going to laser tag
until I figure this out.

10:00.330 --> 10:03.250
We kind of walked
right into that.

10:03.250 --> 10:04.460
How can we help?

10:04.460 --> 10:07.250
That plate had some of your
mom's favorite pictures

10:07.250 --> 10:08.290
from that phone she lost!

10:08.290 --> 10:10.170
She didn't lose it,

10:10.170 --> 10:12.170
she just didn't want to dig
it out of a port-a potty.

10:12.170 --> 10:14.710
Okay, what if
we recreate the photos

10:14.710 --> 10:17.500
and glue them
on a new plate?

10:17.500 --> 10:19.170
She won't notice.

10:19.170 --> 10:20.540
Maybe she won't notice.

10:20.540 --> 10:22.620
Oh, I pray
she won't notice.

10:22.620 --> 10:26.170
Told you we weren't
the only ones afraid of Mom.

10:26.170 --> 10:29.420
I came up with a plan
to figure out what
Aidan wants.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.250
Well, it's not really a plan.

10:31.250 --> 10:32.670
It's more of a scheme.

10:32.670 --> 10:35.080
Sure, I'm up
for playing a game.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.620
What kind?

10:36.620 --> 10:40.500
It's time to play
America's favorite family game

10:40.500 --> 10:43.250
"Who Knows Who Best?"

10:43.250 --> 10:44.620
What's going on?

10:44.620 --> 10:48.380
You know my family,
always playing wacky games.

10:48.380 --> 10:50.080
This is a favorite.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.670
We've never
played this before.

10:51.670 --> 10:54.250
I made it up just to get
personal info on Aidan.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.750
I mean, I guess I could have
talked to him for hours

10:56.750 --> 10:58.620
and found out what he wants
that way, but come on,

10:58.620 --> 11:01.500
a fake game show,
way more fun.

11:14.380 --> 11:16.540
But I have six more verses.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.670

Big time.

11:25.540 --> 11:27.170
It's my only choice.

11:27.170 --> 11:29.830
I have to get personal info
for Aidan's gift.

11:29.830 --> 11:31.500
So if you're keeping score,

11:31.500 --> 11:35.330
this does not count
against my record.

11:35.330 --> 11:38.250

for Harley.

What is Aidan's
sneaker size?

11:43.670 --> 11:45.380

11:45.380 --> 11:46.670

11:55.170 --> 11:58.540
What is Harley's

11:58.540 --> 12:02.750
Yeah, I didn't put
too much effort into
writing questions about me.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.670
The quicker we get
through those,

12:04.670 --> 12:06.500
the more intel
I can get on him.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.330
Harley's last name is Diaz.

Yes, it is.

13:56.330 --> 14:00.000
Aidan wins, 19 to zero!

14:00.000 --> 14:02.580
Well, it was kind
of a ridiculous game.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.670
The questions Harley
got were way harder.

14:04.670 --> 14:06.580
Were they?
I didn't notice.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.710
Maybe you're just
really, really smart.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.960
Why are you dressed
like that?

14:15.960 --> 14:17.290
You're not even
in this picture.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.620

the uniform.

the real hard part.

were in.

make this work.

14:37.750 --> 14:39.960
All right, guys.
What do we think?

14:42.250 --> 14:46.080
It takes more than a $20 wig
to make Beast look like Georgie.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.080
Oh, yeah,

14:47.080 --> 14:48.500
well next time
you want to be Rachel,

14:48.500 --> 14:50.080
maybe pluck your eyebrows.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.500
Well, maybe if I hang it
on the wall really high...

14:51.500 --> 14:53.540
You better be talking
airplane height,

14:53.540 --> 14:55.380

thing's a mess.

what I got him.

Hey. Whoa, did you know
there was a carpet here?

15:16.960 --> 15:19.500
I thought it was just
piles of toys and clothes.

15:19.500 --> 15:20.880
We picked up a little.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.460
Yeah, we thought we'd try
something different.

[doorbell rings]

You're early!

15:37.380 --> 15:39.330
Go!

15:40.670 --> 15:43.380
You get real excited
about pizza.

15:43.380 --> 15:44.750
[doorbell rings]

15:47.330 --> 15:49.080
You should get that.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.330
It's for you.

15:50.330 --> 15:52.380
For me?
But it's your house.

15:52.380 --> 15:54.920
I wanted to get you
the perfect gift.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.670
That's why I staged
that crazy game show

15:56.670 --> 15:58.710
to find out what
that would be.

15:58.710 --> 16:01.120
Most of your answers
had something in common.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.420
Aerosmith.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.330
Because they're my dad's
favorite band.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.500
Tokyo.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.250
Because my dad lives there.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.750
David Ortiz.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.540
My dad caught a home run ball
off him for me.

16:10.540 --> 16:11.620
We even got it signed.

16:11.620 --> 16:15.380
So, based on
your own answers,

16:15.380 --> 16:17.500
here's your perfect gift.

16:22.380 --> 16:23.830
Dad?

16:34.250 --> 16:36.460
What just happened?

16:41.580 --> 16:43.580
Hey, what's going on?

16:43.580 --> 16:45.380
I thought you'd love
seeing your dad.

16:45.380 --> 16:48.120
I got the right guy,
didn't I?

16:48.120 --> 16:50.540
How many Charles Peters
could there be in Tokyo?

16:50.540 --> 16:51.540
That's him.

16:51.540 --> 16:53.790
-Then why are you upset?
-Because...

16:53.790 --> 16:55.460
I've been wanting him
to visit me for months...

16:55.460 --> 16:56.920
And here he is!

16:56.920 --> 16:59.710
But he only came when
you asked him to!

17:01.540 --> 17:03.580
Oh.

17:03.580 --> 17:05.120
Yes. Yes.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.670
But there's a reason
for that.

17:06.670 --> 17:08.580
Aidan talks about you
all the time.

17:08.580 --> 17:12.170
Like how you caught
the home run off Big Papi.

17:12.170 --> 17:14.830
How you play a mean air guitar
to "Walk This Way."

17:14.830 --> 17:16.790
Oh, and about that diner
you'd take him to every Friday

17:16.790 --> 17:18.330
for pizza burgers.

17:18.330 --> 17:21.170
He really misses you
and wants to see you.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.880
I had no idea.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.580
He hasn't said
any of that to me.

17:25.580 --> 17:27.380
I get that.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.540
I had to concoct
some crazy game show
to figure it out.

17:30.540 --> 17:34.790
Aidan's maybe not so good
at talking about his feelings.

17:34.790 --> 17:40.040
I'm afraid that might
be another thing he's got
in common with his old man.

17:40.040 --> 17:45.960
I'm maybe not so good
at telling him how much
I miss him either.

17:45.960 --> 17:49.580
Your dad came when I asked
because you never did.

17:49.580 --> 17:52.420
Oh.
[chuckles]

17:52.420 --> 17:56.460
Well, if I was comfortable
talking about my feelings

17:56.460 --> 17:59.620
I'd say I feel
like a jerk right now.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.000
Don't worry.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.830
My reaction to the wrench
took some time too.

18:03.830 --> 18:05.960
[chuckles]
Thanks, Harley.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.710
This is the best gift
anyone's ever given me.

18:08.710 --> 18:11.080
You better get back
in there before

18:11.080 --> 18:13.920
Ethan starts singing him
the game show theme song.

18:36.210 --> 18:38.710
Am I nuts, or does
that look like--

18:38.710 --> 18:41.500
It is!
It's Mom's plate!

18:41.500 --> 18:43.580
I don't believe it.

18:47.790 --> 18:49.790
It still has our brownies.

18:49.790 --> 18:51.960
That sweet old lady
threw them out.

18:51.960 --> 18:55.670
Looks like she
only had one.

18:55.670 --> 18:57.170
Correction.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.000
One bite.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.830
If she hadn't paid us
a hundred dollars,

19:01.830 --> 19:03.170
I'd be really hurt
right now.

19:07.620 --> 19:10.790
I am so glad you
found that in the dumpster.

19:10.790 --> 19:11.920
This is great!

19:11.920 --> 19:14.790
Not if you baked
the brownies.

19:14.790 --> 19:16.710
Try being more sensitive.

19:16.710 --> 19:18.000
Best part is,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.170
I can still get in
a whole day of Dad TV

19:20.170 --> 19:22.210
-before Mom gets back.

19:22.210 --> 19:24.540

regarding laser tag.

19:26.670 --> 19:29.750
Shall we say tomorrow,
10 AM?

19:29.750 --> 19:31.000
Make it 9.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.670
Just for the crack
about the brownies.

19:36.790 --> 19:39.210
Hey, I got your text
that you wanted to see me.

19:39.210 --> 19:42.750
I was worried
I might be walking into
another fake game show.

19:42.750 --> 19:43.830
No.

19:43.830 --> 19:46.540
From now on,
I'm being honest
with you.

19:50.830 --> 19:54.210
That wrench you gave me
was perfect.

19:54.210 --> 19:57.170
But there's one gift
you could give me

19:57.170 --> 19:59.670
that would be
even better.

19:59.670 --> 20:00.790
[softly]
What?

20:00.790 --> 20:03.210
Will you be my escort
at my  quinceañera?

20:03.210 --> 20:05.750
Wow.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.830
It means so much
that you'd ask me.

20:07.830 --> 20:09.830
I'd love to be
your escort...

20:09.830 --> 20:10.830
[giggles]

20:10.830 --> 20:13.830
...but I can't.

20:17.790 --> 20:19.750
When my Dad leaves tomorrow,

20:19.750 --> 20:22.120
-I'm going with him.
-To Tokyo?

20:22.120 --> 20:24.750
We both thought
the other one was doing okay,

20:24.750 --> 20:27.830
but turns out,
we weren't.

20:27.830 --> 20:30.210
We...

20:30.210 --> 20:33.670
Missed spending
time together?

20:33.670 --> 20:34.830
Yeah.

20:34.830 --> 20:37.330
I'm still not great
with the feelings stuff.

20:37.330 --> 20:41.750
But family is the most
important thing.

20:41.750 --> 20:44.790
I learned that
from yours.

20:51.790 --> 20:55.790
♪ I lose my way ♪

20:55.790 --> 21:00.920
♪ There's a voice that always
brings me back to you ♪

21:00.920 --> 21:04.880
♪ I lose my faith ♪

21:04.880 --> 21:09.920
♪ You're the angel that
reminds me what I had to do ♪

21:09.920 --> 21:13.830
♪ We laugh and cry
And say good-bye ♪

21:13.830 --> 21:17.000
Thought you might want
your favorite blanket.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.880
And your favorite slippers.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.040
And your favorite tea.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.670
Made with honey,
like you like.

21:27.210 --> 21:30.960
And your favorite way
to be cheered up.

21:36.290 --> 21:37.830
Actually,

21:37.830 --> 21:40.170
it's my second favorite way
to be cheered up.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.170
[Harley]
After all Aidan and I
had been through,

21:44.170 --> 21:47.040
letting him go wasn't easy.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.830
But it was right.

21:48.830 --> 21:51.210
The perfect gift isn't giving
someone what they want.

21:51.210 --> 21:54.000
It's giving them
what they need.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.960
♪ Wherever you go
I'll go ♪
