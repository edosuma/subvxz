WEBVTT

01:14.367 --> 01:16.494
Come on, people, let's clean it up.

01:16.577 --> 01:20.414
Howard, don't tell me you can't carry
more than a piece of crepe paper.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.710
Hi, Max, sorry I'm late.

01:24.794 --> 01:27.797
What new threat was it this time?
Root Rot man?

01:27.880 --> 01:30.633
This time it really was Mr. Wayne.
He needed a ride.

01:30.716 --> 01:32.468
His back again. Where's Dana?

01:32.551 --> 01:36.305
She got tired of waiting for you.
Sounds like an old song, doesn't it?

01:36.389 --> 01:38.224
Well, if it isn't Mr. School Spirit.

01:38.307 --> 01:41.060
Don't worry, McGinnis,
Batman filled in for you.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.062
Yeah.

01:43.479 --> 01:44.563
What was that about?

01:44.647 --> 01:46.649
I, uh, made a little joke.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.317
What kind of little joke?

01:48.401 --> 01:52.697
Just something about how this school
sees more of Batman than it does of you.

01:54.073 --> 01:56.534
I know, it wasn't that funny.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.911
- I'm sorry. okay?

01:58.995 --> 02:01.914
You can't even joke about this,
understand?

02:01.998 --> 02:03.749
It just slipped out.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.630
And I don't get
what the big deal is, anyway.

02:09.714 --> 02:13.551
If a few more people knew your secret,
especially a certain girlfriend,

02:13.634 --> 02:15.303
life might be a lot easier for you.

02:15.386 --> 02:19.140
Oh, yeah, just like with the Diaz kid.
Remember how easy that got?

02:21.142 --> 02:24.312
- Come on, it was all over the Net.
- The Net's a big place, McGinnis.

02:24.979 --> 02:27.356
It happened right after
I started being Batman.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.901
<i>There was this kid, Miguel Diaz,
around the same age as my brother.</i>

02:30.985 --> 02:33.988
<i>He was gonzo
about that new action toy, Soldier Sam.</i>

02:34.071 --> 02:35.990
It's all over
for you, Dr. Dark Blood.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.409
And just how do you plan to stop me?

02:38.492 --> 02:39.910
With this.

02:41.454 --> 02:42.872
And this.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.793
Shouldn't he be playing?

02:47.877 --> 02:48.878
He is playing.

02:48.961 --> 02:51.130
I mean with the other children.

02:51.881 --> 02:53.132
Miguel?

02:55.634 --> 02:56.634
Miguel.

02:58.888 --> 03:02.224
Why don't you give Soldier Sam a rest
and go play with the other boys?

03:02.308 --> 03:03.768
- But, Mom...
- Come on.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.354
You've been doing that all day.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.064
Time for something else.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.487
Such aggressive behavior.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.496
You can get him! Beat him up!

03:24.914 --> 03:26.874
Soldier Sam to the tower.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.253
<i>Meanwhile, way across town,</i>

03:31.337 --> 03:33.422
<i>the Kobra Gang
was playing its own games.</i>

03:33.506 --> 03:36.675
<i>They'd just broken into a credit reserve
hoping to make a fast withdrawal.</i>

03:36.759 --> 03:38.260
<i>There was just one problem.</i>

03:43.766 --> 03:46.894
- It's Batman. He was waiting for us.
- But how?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.104
I'm gonna try to force them down.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.480
I'll tell the commissioner.

04:35.651 --> 04:38.946
- He's gaining.
- Let him. It'II make him easier to hit.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.717
There is a kid on top.
I'm going after him.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.805
Somebody call the fire department.

05:07.725 --> 05:09.059
My baby.

05:31.207 --> 05:33.542
It's all right. Don't be afraid.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.004
Get away from me!

05:48.682 --> 05:50.434
Hey, I'm one of the good guys.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.102
You don't look like a good guy.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.897
This? It's just to scare
the bad guys, really.

06:01.779 --> 06:03.489
Come on, you have to trust me.

06:06.242 --> 06:08.244
Slag it. Look.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.371
You're just a guy.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.790
Yeah, a guy who doesn't
wanna see you barbecue.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.042
Reach. You can do it.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.720
Miguel.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.597
Mom.

06:37.398 --> 06:40.276
Great story.
All it did was prove my point.

06:40.359 --> 06:43.654
You saved the kid, he saw your face
and it wasn't a problem.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.823
Now, let's go tell Dana.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.450
- There's more?
- Oh, yeah.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.680
<i>As you can probably guess,
they weren't happy</i>

06:51.704 --> 06:53.539
<i>down at Kobra Headquarters.</i>

06:53.622 --> 06:55.291
Batman? Again?

06:55.374 --> 06:57.668
It's almost as if
he knows what we're planning.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.838
- How do you suppose that happened?
- I wouldn't know.

07:03.591 --> 07:06.927
Perhaps we should find out
exactly what you do know.

07:07.011 --> 07:10.848
You know it can't harm you.
It's a sensor, not a transmitter.

07:12.558 --> 07:15.436
It reads the fluctuation
in your synaptic response

07:15.519 --> 07:18.022
and turns your thoughts into pictures.

07:19.648 --> 07:22.693
Is there anyone
you told about our operation?

07:22.776 --> 07:24.612
No, I would never.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.703
<i>I'm telling you this
because I still owe you something.</i>

07:32.786 --> 07:34.038
<i>Just make sure your creds</i>

07:34.121 --> 07:36.040
<i>are out of the Gotham Federal Bank
by Monday.</i>

07:36.123 --> 07:37.666
<i>I can't say any more than that.</i>

07:39.084 --> 07:41.879
Warning someone
outside the organization.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.089
On a cell phone, no less.

07:45.007 --> 07:46.634
That's how Batman picked it up.

07:46.717 --> 07:49.762
It was my brother.
I had to warn him, he's family.

07:49.845 --> 07:52.556
Kobra is your only family.

07:52.640 --> 07:55.309
And in your weakness,
you just betrayed us.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.062
No! No, please!

08:07.780 --> 08:09.156
No...

08:09.907 --> 08:11.075
No!

08:17.081 --> 08:18.081
Aah!

08:21.460 --> 08:24.797
Cobras love rodents.
If only it were Batman.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.133
Sir, something you should see.

08:28.801 --> 08:30.386
<i>It all must have been very scary.</i>

08:30.469 --> 08:32.638
<i>I wasn't scared, not of Batman.</i>

08:32.721 --> 08:35.766
<i>He's just a guy like everybody else.
With his mask off, I mean.</i>

08:42.314 --> 08:44.858
So the kid got on TV
and told the whole world

08:44.942 --> 08:46.276
how he saw you without your mask?

08:46.360 --> 08:47.360
Yep.

08:47.403 --> 08:49.154
And the old man, he saw the report?

08:49.238 --> 08:51.782
How could he not?
It was the Newsbyte of the day.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.327
What were you thinking?

08:55.411 --> 08:58.080
He would have died,
there was no other way.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.915
There's always another way.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.042
I don't see
what you're so worried about.

09:02.126 --> 09:03.645
He's probably forgotten
what I look like by now.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.087
That doesn't matter!

09:05.170 --> 09:08.340
What matters is that other people
think he knows what you look like.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.051
You've made that little boy a target.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.765
This is your block, honey.

09:16.849 --> 09:19.017
You be careful now,
and I'll see you next week.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.894
And be sure to keep practicing.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.062
I will.

09:23.856 --> 09:26.191
His piano teacher
just walked him to his corner.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.360
Once he's settled in,
I'm gonna call it a night.

09:28.444 --> 09:29.361
<i>Wrong.</i>

09:29.445 --> 09:32.197
<i>He's no less of a target indoors
than he is outdoors.</i>

09:32.281 --> 09:35.033
Come <i>on, I...
I can't follow him forever.</i>

09:35.117 --> 09:37.286
<i>I've got a girlfriend, homework, a life.</i>

09:37.369 --> 09:39.455
<i>I won't be able to do my job as Batman.</i>

09:40.706 --> 09:42.958
All right, I'll call the commissioner.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.921
See what I can do
about getting you some relief.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.971
Come on, kid, don't stop now.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.973
Five more houses and you're home.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.916
Something to make you
a little more cooperative.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.264
Batman, look out!

10:45.270 --> 10:46.772
No!

10:51.485 --> 10:52.653
No!

11:10.212 --> 11:11.588
Stay behind me.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.927
The teeth of a Kobra are sharp.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.762
So sharp, you'll barely feel them.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.181
But you will feel its paralyzing poison.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.602
Thanks for the information.

11:52.129 --> 11:53.338
Step away from the boy.

11:53.422 --> 11:54.673
And turn around slowly.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.925
No, don't shoot, it's Batman.

11:57.009 --> 11:58.552
He's one of the good guys.

12:02.097 --> 12:04.349
Sorry. Can't be too careful, you know?

12:04.433 --> 12:06.393
Sure, just doing your job.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.162
I assume the commissioner
explained everything?

12:08.186 --> 12:11.440
Yeah, we're supposed to take the kid in.
Protective custody.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.285
Hey, wait a minute.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.537
Where's Sam? I've lost Soldier <i>Sam.</i>

12:28.707 --> 12:31.001
- Here you go, big guy.
- Thank you.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.343
<i>- Terry, are you there?</i>
- I'm <i>here.</i>

12:39.426 --> 12:41.066
Kobra just tried
to make a move on Miguel.

12:41.136 --> 12:42.846
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.306
Cops were just here sweeping up.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.725
Thanks for arranging things
with the commish.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.018
I didn't.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.978
She was in a meeting,
I couldn't get through.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.484
Terry?

12:55.567 --> 12:57.694
I think Ijust handed Miguel over
to Kobra.

13:02.366 --> 13:04.326
Don't worry, Miguel, I'II save you.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.008
The cops were Kobra agents?

13:20.092 --> 13:22.803
Yeah, they must have figured
I'd be watching over Miguel,

13:22.886 --> 13:24.596
so they set up a distraction.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.598
The old man
never would've fallen for it.

13:26.682 --> 13:29.601
Hey, don't beat yourself up.
You were just starting out, remember?

13:29.685 --> 13:31.436
And I walked right into it.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.154
Well?

13:42.698 --> 13:45.784
Nothing. I can't believe
I could be so stupid.

13:45.867 --> 13:49.579
They looked like cops.
And their cars, they looked so real.

13:49.663 --> 13:53.583
They probably were real, stolen.
And that's good for us.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.378
Every Gotham police car
has its own locator frequency.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.088
All I need is the car number.

13:58.171 --> 14:01.008
Oh, great. What was it?

14:01.091 --> 14:03.927
Two-something-three...

14:05.429 --> 14:06.680
Slag it.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.267
Wait. I might not remember,

14:10.350 --> 14:12.519
but the recorder in the Batmobile will.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.463
This isn't the police station.

14:40.005 --> 14:43.759
What an astute little child.
Such clarity of thought.

14:45.635 --> 14:46.803
Hook him up.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.400
They've ditched the cars.
Don't see the boy.

15:00.484 --> 15:02.569
- Follow them.
- Like you had to tell me.

15:13.497 --> 15:15.624
No, I won't put it on. I won't.

15:15.707 --> 15:19.961
Sit still and behave
or you won't get this back, ever.

15:28.804 --> 15:32.057
Now, let's see
what kind of images we get.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.147
What's wrong with it?

15:39.231 --> 15:43.318
We've never used it on a child before.
Their minds are a bit more erratic.

15:44.236 --> 15:48.907
Now, Miguel, I want you
to remember back to last week.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.034
The fire on top of the tower.

15:54.663 --> 15:57.916
Excellent. You were in danger.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.168
Batman came out of the smoke
to save you.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.005
That's right.

16:20.021 --> 16:24.234
And as he got closer,
he took off his mask, didn't he?

16:24.442 --> 16:25.318
Uh-huh.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.903
And what did he look like?

16:29.906 --> 16:32.492
- What's wrong?
- He's losing his concentration.

16:32.576 --> 16:34.661
Think. What did he look like?

16:34.744 --> 16:36.621
I wanna go home.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.540
- Can I go home?
- No.

16:42.586 --> 16:44.713
Here, relax.

16:47.257 --> 16:52.179
All I want is for you to concentrate
as hard as you can on his face.

16:52.804 --> 16:55.182
You can remember his face, can't you?

16:58.685 --> 17:01.771
Better, much better. That's it.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.080
Any second now.

17:19.789 --> 17:22.834
Yes! There it is. The face of Batman.

17:22.918 --> 17:25.045
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

17:25.128 --> 17:28.506
Wait a minute.
I've seen him before, I'm sure of it.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.508
- Where?
- I can't remember.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.594
We'll send this picture
through the database.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.846
It shouldn't take long
to come up with a name.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.849
- I wanna go home.
- Of course.

18:41.788 --> 18:42.956
Batman.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.711
Step away from the door. We're leaving.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.129
No, you're not.

18:53.383 --> 18:54.551
Hey!

19:02.183 --> 19:03.268
What's so funny?

19:03.351 --> 19:07.355
I might have lost this one battle,
but you've lost the war.

19:07.439 --> 19:11.192
See, we know what you look like
under that mask.

19:11.276 --> 19:13.278
- All of us do.
- What?

19:13.361 --> 19:15.864
You can thank your little friend here.

19:15.947 --> 19:18.867
I pulled a perfect image of your face
from his memory,

19:18.950 --> 19:22.287
and I've uploaded it
to every Kobra site in the world.

19:22.370 --> 19:26.333
It'll only be a matter of time
before my colleagues find out your name.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.959
Gotham Police. Open up!

19:32.964 --> 19:35.925
I've done well. I'll be remembered.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.386
Don't!

19:53.735 --> 19:56.029
So, the kid imagined you
as an action figure.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.112
Yeah.

19:57.155 --> 19:58.841
I guess in his mind
he was just substituting

19:58.865 --> 19:59.908
one hero for another.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.594
Don't you ever worry
that he might remember

20:01.618 --> 20:02.827
what you really look like?

20:02.911 --> 20:05.830
It was smoky on that tower.
He was scared.

20:06.331 --> 20:09.125
I don't think he ever got
a good look at my face to begin with.

20:10.377 --> 20:13.129
- Thanks.
- How can you be so sure?

20:13.213 --> 20:15.090
'Cause that was him.

20:15.173 --> 20:16.758
I see him here all the time.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.843
And he's never recognized you?

20:18.927 --> 20:20.512
Never.

20:20.595 --> 20:23.306
- Hey, Miguel? Let's go.
- I'm coming.
