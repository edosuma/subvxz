<i>There is a secret test</i>
<i>hidden within the SA T.</i>

00:28.773 --> 00:31.833
<i>This test does not measure</i>
<i>a student's aptitude...</i>

00:32.043 --> 00:34.978
<i>...at reading, writing</i>
<i>and arithmetic.</i>

00:35.146 --> 00:37.808
<i>It measures</i>
<i>a student's innate ability...</i>

00:37.982 --> 00:41.918
<i>...to lie, cheat, fight and kill.</i>

00:42.086 --> 00:48.286
<i>Those who score well are recruited</i>
<i>into a secret paramilitary academy.</i>

00:50.294 --> 00:54.924
<i>Some call them seductresses.</i>
<i>Some call them spies.</i>

00:55.099 --> 00:59.627
<i>Fools call them innocent.</i>
<i>They call themselves D.E.B.S.</i>

02:32.229 --> 02:35.130
<i>Good morning, D.E.B.S.</i>
<i>Attention, D.E.B.S.!</i>

02:35.299 --> 02:40.134
<i>Attention! Emergency alert!</i>
<i>That means report right now!</i>

02:40.304 --> 02:44.240
<i>Right this second!</i>
<i>You have no time to sleep, ladies!</i>

02:44.708 --> 02:46.141
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

02:46.310 --> 02:48.369
<i>-And I mean now, ladies!</i>
-Dominique.

02:48.546 --> 02:50.207
<i>The world might be destroyed</i>
<i>while you nap!</i>

02:50.381 --> 02:52.042
Come on.
Phipps is freaking out.

02:52.216 --> 02:54.684
<i>-I need you guys up!</i>
-Five minutes.

02:56.053 --> 02:59.113
And no boys allowed upstairs.

02:59.290 --> 03:00.882
Out.

03:02.059 --> 03:04.459
-What?
<i>-Let's go! I want everybody up!</i>

03:04.628 --> 03:07.688
-Janet. Five minutes.
-Have you seen my gun?

03:07.898 --> 03:10.492
<i>Move it, move it!</i>
<i>Everybody in the house!</i>

03:10.701 --> 03:12.635
What did I do with it?

03:12.803 --> 03:15.203
D.E.B.S. Max here.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.333
Amy, it's for you.

03:18.509 --> 03:21.808
Hello. No. No! I'm not--

03:21.979 --> 03:23.947
I'm not talking about this anymore.

03:24.115 --> 03:25.810
Get out.

03:25.983 --> 03:28.850
And take your clothes with you.
I don't do laundry.

03:29.019 --> 03:30.953
<i>Let's go! Let's go, let's go!</i>

03:31.122 --> 03:34.182
<i>Move it, move it, move it!</i>
<i>I don't have all day, D.E.B.S.</i>

03:34.358 --> 03:37.350
<i>I do not have all day!</i>

03:37.528 --> 03:38.654
<i>Ten!</i>

03:38.829 --> 03:42.356
-Bobby, seriously, it's not a good time.
<i>-Nine.</i>

03:42.600 --> 03:45.194
<i>-Eight.</i>
<i>-When? When is a good time?</i>

03:45.369 --> 03:47.667
-Stop calling.
-Amy!

03:47.838 --> 03:50.671
<i>-Five. Four. Three.</i>
-I'm coming.

03:50.841 --> 03:52.433
<i>After all we've been through?</i>

03:52.610 --> 03:54.805
<i>-Two, one.</i>
-Goodbye, Bobby.

04:01.519 --> 04:03.316
I broke up with Bobby.

04:03.487 --> 04:05.955
-What?
-I broke up with Bobby.

04:06.123 --> 04:09.490
-Oh, my God! Why?
-He was just so boring.

04:09.827 --> 04:11.658
He's an ass.

04:11.862 --> 04:12.988
What?

04:14.165 --> 04:16.827
I like him. I think he's sweet.

04:17.701 --> 04:20.329
-I'm just not in love.
-What?

04:20.504 --> 04:22.631
I said, I want to be in love!

04:23.274 --> 04:25.674
Why are you yelling?

04:44.028 --> 04:45.859
-Hi, Amy.
-Hi.

04:46.897 --> 04:48.660
-Hey, Mr. P.
-Don't call me that.

04:48.832 --> 04:50.493
-Hey, Mr. P.
-What's up, Mr. P?

04:50.668 --> 04:52.602
<i>Bonjour</i>, Mr. P.

04:52.803 --> 04:56.569
Hey, can I get a farmer's daughter
short stack and bacon, well done.

04:56.740 --> 04:58.901
Tofu scramble, peach smoothie,
non-dairy.

04:59.076 --> 05:02.204
-Cheeseburger, extra pickles.
-Coffee, black.

05:02.813 --> 05:05.714
We have a special guest with us
this morning.

05:05.883 --> 05:06.817
-Ms. Petrie.
-Ms. Petrie?

05:06.817 --> 05:07.784
-Ms. Petrie.
-Ms. Petrie?

05:07.952 --> 05:09.613
She never comes down here!

05:12.856 --> 05:13.880
Ladies.

05:14.091 --> 05:16.924
I just want to say what
a pleasure it is to meet you.

05:17.094 --> 05:19.028
No time for pleasantries.

05:19.196 --> 05:22.461
Phipps, a matter of some urgency
has come to my attention.

05:22.633 --> 05:24.794
Lucy Diamond is back in the States.

05:24.969 --> 05:27.096
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, shit.

05:27.271 --> 05:29.296
I'm writing my thesis on her.

05:29.473 --> 05:32.374
I expect to be kept
in the loop on this one.

05:33.244 --> 05:35.940
Let's show some hustle.

05:41.352 --> 05:43.718
-I can't believe she's back.
-Who's Lucy Diamond?

05:43.887 --> 05:45.115
Lucy Diamond.

05:45.589 --> 05:49.355
She's the last surviving member
of the Reynolds crime syndicate.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.892
Her family did battle
with the Schaffers...

05:52.062 --> 05:55.156
...in a vicious blood feud
that lasted a decade.

05:55.366 --> 05:58.733
After her father's death, she inherited
the keys to his kingdom:

05:59.169 --> 06:02.070
Illegal arms-running,
smuggling, gambling...

06:02.239 --> 06:04.639
...and her specialty, diamond theft.

06:04.808 --> 06:09.074
She's protected by a loyal band
of mercenaries, led by this man...

06:09.246 --> 06:10.508
...Scud.

06:10.681 --> 06:15.243
It is believed Lucy Diamond was
behind the plot to sink Australia in '99.

06:15.419 --> 06:18.786
Three attempts have been made
to apprehend her. All failed.

06:18.956 --> 06:20.981
In 2003 she went underground...

06:21.158 --> 06:24.025
...and has not been seen
or heard from since.

06:24.194 --> 06:27.652
-Yikes.
-That's not even the bad part.

06:27.831 --> 06:29.458
What's the bad part?

06:29.633 --> 06:31.999
No one has ever fought her...

06:32.202 --> 06:34.830
...and lived to tell about it.

06:35.306 --> 06:41.609
Peach smoothie, farmer's daughter,
tofu scramble and cheeseburger.

06:41.779 --> 06:43.041
Coffee.

06:43.347 --> 06:45.440
So why do you think
she's back in town?

06:46.183 --> 06:51.348
Our intel suggests she's in town to
meet this woman. Ninotchka Kaprova.

06:51.522 --> 06:54.389
Ex-KGB, now freelance assassin.

06:54.558 --> 06:57.288
They're scheduled to meet tonight,
2000 hours.

06:57.461 --> 07:00.157
Find out what Lucy is up to.
Strictly surveillance.

07:00.331 --> 07:04.563
Do not try to apprehend her
yourselves. Max, you're in charge.

07:04.735 --> 07:08.171
Amy, you're second.
And, D.E.B.S., be careful.

07:14.011 --> 07:16.741
What does a reclusive
criminal mastermind want...

07:16.947 --> 07:19.472
...with a Russian trained killer?

07:49.546 --> 07:52.481
Your scheduled meet,
2000 hours.

07:53.050 --> 07:55.177
-Where'd you find her?
-Zeda tipped us.

07:55.352 --> 07:59.345
Said she's available. She's in
from Prague. Relocating stateside.

07:59.890 --> 08:02.290
-Assassin?
-Check.

08:02.593 --> 08:05.858
-Where's the meet?
-Les Deux Amours.

08:06.029 --> 08:08.520
Trendy, yet discreet.

08:14.405 --> 08:16.270
Cancel it.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.874
Why? It's all set up.

08:19.143 --> 08:22.237
-I don't do blind dates.
-Well, it's not a blind date...

08:22.413 --> 08:25.541
-...if you know what they look like.
-Tell her I'm not coming.

08:25.716 --> 08:28.583
-Say I came down with something.
-Lucy, it's been two years.

08:28.752 --> 08:30.811
-You have to get out there.
-I am out there.

08:31.021 --> 08:33.649
I went out with that drummer,
the girl that talked loud.

08:33.823 --> 08:36.315
You didn't go out with her.
We all went out together.

08:36.527 --> 08:39.894
Then you lied and said you had food
poisoning, and you went home early.

08:40.063 --> 08:44.124
Yeah, well, she talked really loud,
even when you were right next to her.

08:44.301 --> 08:47.498
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to drown yourself...

08:47.671 --> 08:51.402
...in your little schemes to destroy
the world, but you need to get over it.

08:51.575 --> 08:53.304
-You were dumped.
-I was not dumped.

08:53.477 --> 08:56.139
Oh, you were dumped hard.
And that sucks.

08:56.313 --> 08:58.679
You took time off
to go to Antarctica or whatever.

08:58.849 --> 09:00.248
Reykjavik. It's in Iceland.

09:00.417 --> 09:03.614
But now it's time to get back
in the game, Lucy.

09:03.787 --> 09:07.086
You've got a date tonight with
a beautiful Russian assassin...

09:07.257 --> 09:09.350
...and you're gonna show up.

09:10.194 --> 09:12.628
-Lucy.
-Fine.

09:12.796 --> 09:15.560
Okay, I'll go. I'll be there.

09:16.300 --> 09:18.791
Just promise me you'll be open.

09:18.969 --> 09:22.200
-Open to what?
-Open to love.

09:57.975 --> 09:59.636
Hey, look. Look. Check this out.

09:59.810 --> 10:02.711
Ms. Petrie is handpicking girls
for the International Bureau.

10:02.913 --> 10:04.813
I'm gonna see if
I can get an interview.

10:04.982 --> 10:08.145
Think Mr. Phipps would let me
take time off after endgame?

10:08.318 --> 10:10.218
What are you talking about?

10:10.387 --> 10:13.879
I don't know. There's this
art school in Barcelona.

10:14.057 --> 10:15.854
Art school?

10:16.026 --> 10:18.654
You're the perfect score.
You could have your choice...

10:18.829 --> 10:21.354
...of any assignment you want
after endgame.

10:22.366 --> 10:25.233
-Who's your best friend?
-You are my best friend.

10:25.402 --> 10:27.893
What did I say to you
the very first day of academy?

10:28.071 --> 10:30.062
"That's my bunk, bitch."

10:30.240 --> 10:33.209
-Okay, after I said that.
-"D.E.B.S. stick together."

10:33.377 --> 10:34.742
Exactly.

10:34.912 --> 10:38.040
We've been through four years
of hell, and now we're top squad.

10:38.215 --> 10:40.547
We're just getting to the good stuff.

10:41.385 --> 10:45.583
So you're not gonna ruin it all
by going to art school.

10:46.256 --> 10:50.352
-Am I right?
-Yes. You are always right.

10:50.661 --> 10:54.392
You need to put it here.
Don't be an idiot for once.

10:54.565 --> 10:56.226
You need to speak
English or French.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.800
"Fringlish" is not a language.

11:00.571 --> 11:04.132
-D.E.B.S. Janet speaking. Over.
<i>-Janet, put her on.</i>

11:04.308 --> 11:06.902
-It's Bobby.
-I don't wanna talk to him.

11:07.711 --> 11:11.306
-She doesn't want to talk to you. Over.
<i>-Bullshit! I need to talk to her.</i>

11:11.481 --> 11:14.279
Copy that.
He really needs to see you.

11:14.451 --> 11:17.249
He should not call her.
It is embarrassing.

11:17.888 --> 11:20.118
Bobby, I told you, it's over.

11:20.691 --> 11:22.955
-Over.
<i>-We've gotta talk.</i>

11:23.126 --> 11:25.117
I'm serious. No.

11:25.295 --> 11:26.557
Amy, we need to talk.

11:26.763 --> 11:28.958
Jesus, Bobby,
what are you doing here?

11:29.132 --> 11:32.158
Think you guys are the only ones
onto Diamond? Everyone's here:

11:32.336 --> 11:33.963
The feds, the CIA.

11:34.438 --> 11:36.668
-Can't believe it.
-This is our stakeout.

11:36.840 --> 11:40.469
Always sticking their heads
in our business. It's unbelievable.

11:40.644 --> 11:43.272
Could you guys excuse us
for a minute?

11:44.247 --> 11:47.114
Why do you have to be
such a jerk about everything?

11:47.284 --> 11:50.481
When my girlfriend breaks
up with me for no reason...

11:50.654 --> 11:53.122
-...l'm a little hostile.
-It's not for no reason.

11:53.290 --> 11:55.224
-Then give me one.
-I just want more.

11:55.392 --> 11:56.620
-More what?
-I don't know.

11:56.793 --> 12:00.194
-What are they saying?
-I'm not gonna spy on them.

12:00.364 --> 12:02.195
You are a spy, dipshit.

12:02.366 --> 12:04.129
-Is there somebody else?
-No. Nobody.

12:04.301 --> 12:07.202
-Because if there's somebody else--
-Look, I just--

12:07.371 --> 12:10.272
-Speak.
-I'm not in love with you.

12:15.679 --> 12:17.442
Well.

12:17.614 --> 12:20.981
I guess nobody's good enough
for Little Miss Perfect Score.

12:21.385 --> 12:23.319
Shut up!

12:24.287 --> 12:26.448
Oh, yeah, you'll be back.

12:36.199 --> 12:37.393
You can do this.

12:37.567 --> 12:39.899
Why is it I can hold the whole world
hostage...

12:40.070 --> 12:42.163
...l'm scared of going on
one blind date?

12:42.339 --> 12:45.706
Because love is harder
than crime.

12:46.276 --> 12:49.268
Okay, now, knock them dead.

12:50.414 --> 12:52.541
But not really.

12:52.716 --> 12:54.274
Sure.

13:04.428 --> 13:07.693
-Are you okay?
-Hey, she's arrived.

13:10.734 --> 13:12.224
Okay, we've got visual.

13:14.538 --> 13:17.939
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I got lost.

13:19.176 --> 13:22.509
It is no problem. I was early.

13:22.679 --> 13:24.169
-I have that sweater.
-What?

13:24.347 --> 13:26.542
I have the sweater
she's wearing, but in taupe.

13:26.717 --> 13:28.685
Really? Where did you get it?

13:28.852 --> 13:30.012
-Target.
-No way.

13:30.187 --> 13:31.586
Silence!

13:31.755 --> 13:34.246
I'll have the Cobb.

13:34.424 --> 13:35.891
And some wine.

13:36.059 --> 13:38.687
-Do you--? Do you want wine?
-Vodka.

13:39.763 --> 13:41.458
Vodka. Please.

13:45.135 --> 13:47.467
Lucy Diamond, she's....

13:47.938 --> 13:49.769
-What?
-Real.

13:49.940 --> 13:52.738
-I never thought I'd see her in person.
-Yeah.

13:52.909 --> 13:55.207
They also have it in teal.

14:00.417 --> 14:02.146
So you're an assassin?

14:04.855 --> 14:06.720
How's that work?

14:06.890 --> 14:09.085
It's mostly freelance.

14:10.961 --> 14:13.589
So you basically, what,
you kill, like, whoever?

14:13.764 --> 14:15.823
Sometimes maim.

14:15.999 --> 14:18.297
-Maiming's more.
-What are they saying?

14:18.468 --> 14:23.337
They are talking about killing
and how to kill and who to kill.

14:23.507 --> 14:26.305
-Oh, God.
-But I do it just to pay bills.

14:26.977 --> 14:29.605
-Really?
-Mostly...

14:29.780 --> 14:31.873
...I want to be dancer.

14:37.154 --> 14:40.453
-Yeah. Can I have my bracelet back?
-What are you doing?

14:40.624 --> 14:42.649
My dad got that
when he graduated Quantico.

14:42.826 --> 14:48.526
Greatest dance instructor in Russia,
but I can't afford to pay, so he say:

14:48.698 --> 14:53.692
"My wife is cheating on me. You kill
her lover, I give you free lessons."

14:53.937 --> 14:57.464
Fine, okay. Oh, my gosh.

14:57.641 --> 15:01.441
First man was goat farmer,
so I use goat shears.

15:01.778 --> 15:06.806
Second man, he likes chickens, so I
took six chickens and put in thro--

15:07.684 --> 15:09.879
-What's wrong?
-Oh, you know, I just--

15:10.053 --> 15:12.988
I'm feeling really ill.
It's my stomach. l--

15:13.156 --> 15:15.681
-I think I have food poisoning.
-Are you blowing me?

15:15.859 --> 15:17.451
-What?
-Off.

15:17.627 --> 15:20.994
-Are you blowing me off?
-No, no, no.

15:44.154 --> 15:45.644
Let's do this.

16:04.474 --> 16:07.910
-Was it something I said?
-No. No. Look, I just--

16:08.078 --> 16:11.013
I just got back into town,
you know? And-- And--

16:11.181 --> 16:14.912
-And I just got out of this relationship--
-I'm not asking for relationship!

16:16.753 --> 16:19.779
It's not you. You seem really nice,
you do. It's me.

16:21.291 --> 16:23.782
Baby, I can change.

16:27.998 --> 16:29.625
Guys....

16:29.799 --> 16:31.061
I'm just not interested.

16:33.570 --> 16:38.564
Then only you will die alone.

17:31.828 --> 17:34.262
Head Lucy off.
Me and Dom will take the back.

17:34.431 --> 17:37.798
Mr. Phipps specifically ordered us
not to engage her.

17:37.968 --> 17:39.629
Janet....

17:40.971 --> 17:44.429
-Who here isn't gonna graduate?
-Me.

17:45.175 --> 17:47.700
-Why?
-I haven't earned my stripes.

17:48.078 --> 17:50.808
Oh, would that be this thing here?

17:51.781 --> 17:53.112
And why is that?

17:53.283 --> 17:55.012
You need to give me
a recommendation.

17:55.185 --> 17:57.517
I don't see why you just won't--

17:57.687 --> 17:59.154
Not what I asked.

17:59.322 --> 18:02.723
I need to show courage in the face
of unspeakable danger.

18:02.892 --> 18:04.860
Exactly.

18:05.362 --> 18:08.160
So quit your whining
and follow my orders.

18:09.833 --> 18:11.630
Let's go!

18:15.171 --> 18:17.639
Okay. I'll check the parking lot.
You go that way.

18:17.807 --> 18:19.707
-Stay in communication range.
-But Mr.--

18:19.876 --> 18:22.174
You can do this, Janet.

18:42.065 --> 18:44.625
Janet, are you there?

19:01.551 --> 19:03.041
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, my God.

19:03.219 --> 19:06.154
-I am so sorry.
-I'm so sorry.

19:07.724 --> 19:09.715
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, shit.

19:11.861 --> 19:14.056
-You're Lucy Diamond.
-You're a D.E.B.

19:14.230 --> 19:15.925
You have the right to remain silent.

19:16.099 --> 19:18.693
-You're reading me my rights?
-Anything you say can...

19:18.868 --> 19:21.098
...and will be used against you.

19:29.546 --> 19:31.138
-Okay, here's the thing.
-Yeah?

19:31.314 --> 19:34.112
-I am really not up for dying today.
-Me neither.

19:34.284 --> 19:39.153
So I was thinking that....

19:39.322 --> 19:41.722
-Why don't you put your gun down.
-Put yours down.

19:41.891 --> 19:45.622
You're the criminal, and I'm the cop,
so I think I'm more trustworthy.

19:45.795 --> 19:48.161
I was minding my own business
on a blind date...

19:48.331 --> 19:50.731
...when you guys decided
to rain shit all over me.

19:53.770 --> 19:55.499
Wait.

19:55.705 --> 19:57.730
-You were on a blind date?
-Whatever.

19:59.409 --> 20:01.809
-With that Russian girl?
-What?

20:01.978 --> 20:05.505
Nothing. I just--
I didn't know you were a--

20:05.715 --> 20:07.615
Why would you know?

20:09.285 --> 20:12.618
-That really torpedoes my thesis.
-Your thesis?

20:12.789 --> 20:15.917
I'm writing a term paper on you.

20:16.126 --> 20:18.822
-You're kidding me.
-No, it's for Capes and Capers:

20:18.995 --> 20:21.361
Gender Reconstruction
and the Criminal Mastermind.

20:21.531 --> 20:23.658
-It's a really popular class.
-Oh, come on.

20:23.833 --> 20:26.961
But it's hard because there's
only anecdotal evidence about you.

20:28.605 --> 20:31.938
I mean, nobody's actually
ever spoken to you.

20:32.876 --> 20:34.810
Until now.

20:35.612 --> 20:37.807
Right. Until now.

20:43.887 --> 20:46.515
I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.

20:46.689 --> 20:49.954
Amy. Bradshaw.
D.E.B.S. Sector 1.

20:50.126 --> 20:52.219
Lucy Diamond.

20:52.395 --> 20:54.659
It's really nice to meet you.

21:00.003 --> 21:02.335
You're still, you know,
under arrest.

21:03.072 --> 21:05.165
-Am I?
-Amy!

21:07.210 --> 21:09.974
Or you could
just let me go.

21:10.513 --> 21:12.037
-I really couldn't.
-Come on.

21:12.215 --> 21:15.343
Haven't you ever done anything
you're not supposed to?

21:15.885 --> 21:18.649
-Amy, where are you?
-I'm over here.

21:20.690 --> 21:22.783
Son of a bitch!

21:23.860 --> 21:25.828
Are you okay?
We couldn't reach you.

21:25.995 --> 21:28.657
-I'm fine.
-Well, what happened?

21:28.831 --> 21:30.890
She was here.

21:31.067 --> 21:34.195
-Lucy Diamond was here.
-That's impossible.

21:34.604 --> 21:37.198
If she was here,
you'd be dead right now.

21:41.110 --> 21:43.101
You guys....

21:48.585 --> 21:50.849
Sweet Jesus.

21:53.356 --> 21:55.551
Do you know what this means?

21:57.126 --> 22:01.290
You are the only one ever
to fight Lucy Diamond...

22:01.464 --> 22:03.932
...and live to tell about it.

22:11.207 --> 22:13.072
What a disaster!

22:13.243 --> 22:15.473
I am so sorry.
Leave it to the D.E.B.S.

22:15.645 --> 22:19.479
You're in town a week, and
they're all over you, just grabbing--

22:21.084 --> 22:22.881
What?

22:25.088 --> 22:27.556
-Really, what?
-I met somebody.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.428
It was weird,
the thing about the dance...

22:33.596 --> 22:35.564
...but I had a feeling
you and Ninotchka--

22:35.732 --> 22:38.292
No, no, no. Scud,
Ninotchka was a train wreck.

22:38.468 --> 22:40.231
I'm not following you.

22:40.403 --> 22:43.600
Okay, first, swear to me you are
not gonna freak out about this.

22:43.773 --> 22:45.832
-Freak out about what?
-You know, sometimes--

22:46.009 --> 22:48.068
Oh, my God! Who is it?

22:49.145 --> 22:51.306
Okay, what do you know
about an Amy Bradshaw?

22:51.481 --> 22:54.314
Amy Bradshaw. The girl
from the smuggling op.

22:54.484 --> 22:57.942
-No.
-No.

23:03.493 --> 23:05.290
Oh, my God.

23:06.296 --> 23:08.423
Amy Bradshaw?

23:09.198 --> 23:11.257
Blond hair.

23:11.501 --> 23:13.435
Plaid skirt.

23:13.603 --> 23:16.367
She's a D.E.B.
Okay, not only is she a D.E.B...

23:16.539 --> 23:19.337
...she is the D.E.B.
She is the perfect score.

23:19.509 --> 23:21.909
What is that supposed to mean?

23:25.682 --> 23:27.547
Amy Bradshaw is
the only person ever...

23:27.717 --> 23:30.447
...to get a perfect score
on the secret test in the SAT.

23:30.620 --> 23:32.679
-Give me the keys.
-Are you listening?

23:32.855 --> 23:34.789
Perfect score means perfect spy.

23:34.957 --> 23:38.051
She is their pride and joy,
she is literally their poster child.

23:38.227 --> 23:41.424
Well, their poster child doesn't
know it yet, but she's into me.

23:42.031 --> 23:43.191
You can't be serious.

23:43.366 --> 23:46.358
Would you say back on the horse?

23:49.872 --> 23:51.965
Where are you going?

23:53.076 --> 23:54.873
Back.

24:03.586 --> 24:06.384
P.S. She's straight!

24:28.344 --> 24:30.278
You stay here.

24:32.415 --> 24:34.246
Lucy, I beg of you--

24:40.723 --> 24:44.352
All right, D.E.B.S.
Show me what you're made of.

25:31.307 --> 25:33.241
-Amy.
-Oh, my God!

25:34.577 --> 25:36.442
Jesus!

25:36.612 --> 25:38.170
Okay, just hold on.

25:44.487 --> 25:46.819
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to see you.

25:46.989 --> 25:48.456
Why?

25:49.859 --> 25:54.353
Well, I was thinking about what
you said about your paper.

25:55.264 --> 25:56.663
My thesis?

25:56.833 --> 25:59.666
I think it's stupid for you
to do outdated research...

25:59.836 --> 26:02.066
...when you could come
straight to the source.

26:02.505 --> 26:03.802
You?

26:03.973 --> 26:06.999
Come out with me.
I'll let you ask me anything.

26:08.344 --> 26:10.812
-I can't go out with you.
-Why not?

26:11.714 --> 26:14.114
Like, a zillion reasons.

26:18.087 --> 26:20.817
Well, now you have
to come out with me.

26:41.177 --> 26:42.872
Janet, what are you doing here?

26:43.045 --> 26:46.640
I don't know who that is,
but he ruined my sweater!

26:46.816 --> 26:49.512
-I don't know who you think you are.
-Janet, no!

26:55.558 --> 26:57.492
Did you go to Dalton?

26:57.660 --> 26:59.252
Yeah.

27:13.442 --> 27:15.876
-Where are you taking us?
-Where do you want to go?

27:16.078 --> 27:18.012
Home!

27:21.517 --> 27:23.382
What are you doing?

27:51.113 --> 27:53.047
Come on.

27:56.619 --> 27:58.416
Look, these tunnels
go on for miles...

27:58.588 --> 28:01.751
...so you guys could be lost
in there for days, even weeks.

28:05.428 --> 28:07.259
Okay. Suit yourself.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.985
I have to pee.

29:31.280 --> 29:34.147
-Want a beer?
-No.

29:35.851 --> 29:37.648
Come on.

29:51.667 --> 29:53.396
Sit down.

30:08.184 --> 30:10.379
So how long you been a D.E.B.?

30:11.754 --> 30:14.382
You're gonna have to talk to me
sooner or later.

30:14.590 --> 30:17.616
I don't know what you expect
to accomplish by bringing me here.

30:17.827 --> 30:22.526
Lighten up. I know there are a load of
questions you're just dying to ask me.

30:23.265 --> 30:25.699
Come on, tell me about your thesis.

30:28.404 --> 30:31.601
-It's stupid.
-Well, try me.

30:34.777 --> 30:37.245
I guess my central hypothesis...

30:37.413 --> 30:40.780
...is that as a woman operating
in a male-dominated field...

30:40.950 --> 30:43.145
...you felt the need
to overcompensate...

30:43.352 --> 30:46.116
...by being exponentially
more ruthless and diabolical...

30:46.288 --> 30:49.121
...than your established
male counterparts.

30:49.291 --> 30:50.451
I am not more ruthless.

30:50.626 --> 30:55.290
I think an argument could be made
that you are, i.e. we're here.

30:56.799 --> 30:58.664
That's interesting.

31:00.002 --> 31:01.970
Continue.

31:02.138 --> 31:05.301
And I think that these
psychological forces combine...

31:05.474 --> 31:07.738
...to create a kind of emotional void...

31:07.910 --> 31:11.641
...in which you're incapable
of loving or being loved.

31:11.814 --> 31:14.146
-See, that is so not true.
-What?

31:14.316 --> 31:17.979
-I'm open to love. I am!
-I'm sorry. It's just a theory.

31:18.154 --> 31:20.452
Well, what the hell do you know
about it anyway?

31:20.756 --> 31:22.417
Nothing.

31:24.660 --> 31:29.097
I just broke up with my boyfriend,
like, five hours ago.

31:32.802 --> 31:34.667
I'm sorry, that sucks.

31:35.538 --> 31:37.130
Thanks.

31:40.943 --> 31:42.877
Why did you break up with him?

31:43.045 --> 31:46.310
I don't know, it just, it wasn't....

31:46.482 --> 31:49.280
I think love should be irresistible,
like a drug.

31:49.485 --> 31:53.319
I think when it happens you should
just not be able to help yourself.

31:53.489 --> 31:56.014
I just-- I wanted...

31:56.192 --> 31:57.853
...more.

31:59.829 --> 32:02.730
-Babbling.
-No.

32:02.932 --> 32:04.365
You're not at all.

32:04.834 --> 32:07.234
This is so weird. I....

32:08.504 --> 32:11.371
-Why aren't you killing me?
-Not into that.

32:12.174 --> 32:14.165
But you killed those agents
in Antarctica.

32:14.376 --> 32:17.243
They died of frostbite or something.
I never even met them.

32:17.446 --> 32:19.812
-And those ATF guys in Peru?
-Ebola.

32:24.053 --> 32:26.749
You're so not what I expected.

32:27.356 --> 32:29.187
Well, I think that's a good thing.

32:37.032 --> 32:41.492
-So, what's up with Ninotchka?
-Oh, God, she was such a headcase.

32:41.670 --> 32:44.161
-Where do you meet someone like that?
-Jesus Christ!

32:55.284 --> 32:57.218
Yes!

33:01.056 --> 33:02.956
Correct me if I'm wrong...

33:03.125 --> 33:05.855
...but your friend appears
to be hitting on my friend.

33:06.195 --> 33:09.892
-You're not wrong.
-Yeah, but my friend's not into that.

33:13.602 --> 33:16.093
So Bobby's just, like, all over me,
and I just--

33:16.272 --> 33:18.467
I just feel like he doesn't get me,
you know?

33:18.641 --> 33:20.871
Do you ever feel like
nobody understands you?

33:21.043 --> 33:22.567
Yes, all the time.

33:27.783 --> 33:30.047
I am really glad I met you.

33:30.219 --> 33:32.744
I'm really glad I met you too.

33:42.131 --> 33:43.996
I should go.

33:44.166 --> 33:46.031
Okay.

33:51.740 --> 33:54.038
Am I gonna see you again?

33:55.044 --> 33:57.569
Do you wanna see me again?

33:59.281 --> 34:02.182
I mean, I'm breaking,
like, eight federal statutes...

34:02.351 --> 34:05.252
-...being here with you right now.
-Yes, I know.

34:06.755 --> 34:09.746
I could get kicked out
of the D.E.B.S. for this.

34:10.492 --> 34:12.426
For what?

34:18.667 --> 34:21.295
Oh, my God!
She almost kissed you.

34:23.371 --> 34:26.306
You almost let her!

34:32.715 --> 34:34.512
You owe me 50 bucks.

34:34.683 --> 34:36.617
-Amy.
-Take me home.

34:36.784 --> 34:39.219
-It's okay.
-Take me home.

34:48.030 --> 34:49.554
-Amy.
-What?

34:49.732 --> 34:52.462
-Well, when can I see you again?
-You can't.

34:52.868 --> 34:55.837
-Come on.
-I'm serious. We cannot do this again.

34:56.005 --> 34:57.700
Amy.

34:58.173 --> 34:59.970
I have to go.

35:00.743 --> 35:03.143
I'm gonna come find you.

35:11.620 --> 35:13.645
-What just happened?
-Nothing happened.

35:13.822 --> 35:17.758
She was totally going to kiss you.
You're so into her.

35:17.926 --> 35:19.359
I am not!

35:19.528 --> 35:24.227
You violated a prime directive.
Plus, hello, it's a girl.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.561
-You're so busted.
-No, I'm not.

35:26.735 --> 35:28.896
You violated the section codes
as much as me.

35:29.071 --> 35:30.834
D.E.B.S. Code Section 1, Article 2:

35:31.006 --> 35:34.407
"D.E.B.S. will not consort with a known
enemy, under penalty of treason."

35:34.576 --> 35:35.873
I was not consorting.

35:36.045 --> 35:38.741
-You exchanged e-mails with Scud.
-That's not the same.

35:38.914 --> 35:42.008
You got drunk and nearly got
the chancellor of Bulgaria killed.

35:42.184 --> 35:44.846
-That wasn't my fault.
-Remember how I covered for you?

35:45.020 --> 35:47.921
I never told anybody.
If Max found about that...

35:48.090 --> 35:52.049
...you would never ever get
your stripes and never graduate.

35:53.362 --> 35:56.297
-I can't believe you.
-Not a word. Nothing happened.

36:13.449 --> 36:15.212
Where have you been?

36:17.719 --> 36:20.313
I couldn't sleep, so I took a walk.

36:20.489 --> 36:22.980
I was really upset...

36:23.826 --> 36:25.953
...about Bobby.

36:26.128 --> 36:28.221
Yeah, Bobby.

36:28.497 --> 36:31.694
Oh, yeah. I forgot, I'm sorry.

36:33.202 --> 36:36.899
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

36:37.139 --> 36:39.130
Good.

36:39.308 --> 36:42.607
You know, I can't stop thinking
about Lucy Diamond.

36:43.445 --> 36:45.811
-You too?
-Yeah, I feel like she's playing...

36:45.981 --> 36:49.974
...some type of sick game
of cat and mouse with us.

36:50.652 --> 36:52.415
I don't know.

36:52.588 --> 36:55.148
Hey, but you guys
be careful, okay?

36:56.592 --> 36:58.423
Good night.

37:10.472 --> 37:12.667
Yeah. Be careful.

37:23.552 --> 37:26.146
Oh, my God, is it true?
Did you fight Lucy Diamond?

37:26.321 --> 37:28.551
I heard you cut off her hand.
Does she have her hand?

37:28.757 --> 37:32.693
Yes, she still has both of her hands.
God.

37:32.861 --> 37:35.056
-Everybody's talking about it.
-About what?

37:35.264 --> 37:37.323
How you met Lucy
and lived to tell about it.

37:37.499 --> 37:40.229
They're calling you a hero,
when, really, you're a slut.

37:40.402 --> 37:42.632
-You shut up.
-A gay slut.

37:42.804 --> 37:45.864
-I'm not gay!
-Ms. Petrie wants to see you.

37:46.041 --> 37:48.202
What? Janet!

38:03.825 --> 38:06.020
-What's going on?
-Madam Petrie.

38:06.195 --> 38:09.062
-She's coming down.
-Here? Why?

38:09.231 --> 38:11.096
She never comes here.

38:15.037 --> 38:17.835
-Ms. Petrie, I would just like to say--
-Who are you?

38:18.440 --> 38:21.238
-Max Brewer.
-Max Brewer, my time is precious.

38:21.410 --> 38:26.177
-You're wasting it. Where's the girl?
-Bradshaw comma Amy?

38:31.687 --> 38:33.211
You.

38:34.723 --> 38:37.692
Excellent. Well, take one over here.

38:40.596 --> 38:42.257
Right there.

38:43.398 --> 38:45.195
Excellent. Sit.

38:50.706 --> 38:52.435
Chill.

38:56.878 --> 38:58.539
First....

38:58.714 --> 38:59.874
-Amy.
-Amy.

39:00.048 --> 39:03.381
Let me just say how delighted
I am to meet you.

39:03.552 --> 39:05.816
When I heard that one
of our own girls...

39:05.988 --> 39:09.480
...had actually engaged Lucy Diamond
and lived to tell the tale....

39:09.658 --> 39:11.785
I mean, Fred, over at
Central Intelligence...

39:11.960 --> 39:14.827
...nearly peed his pants,
he was so jealous.

39:14.997 --> 39:19.161
This stunt is really going to
put the academy on the map.

39:19.368 --> 39:22.633
Lisa from Interpol called
to extend her congratulations.

39:22.804 --> 39:24.931
I'll bet.

39:25.107 --> 39:27.302
This is just too much fun!

39:27.743 --> 39:29.005
Now, Alice--

39:29.177 --> 39:30.235
-Amy.
-Amy.

39:30.412 --> 39:33.609
We are going to need a description
of the encounter.

39:33.782 --> 39:35.909
-The encounter?
-Everything that happened...

39:36.084 --> 39:38.644
...no matter how small
or seemingly irrelevant.

39:39.121 --> 39:41.487
-Why?
-To develop a profile, of course.

39:41.657 --> 39:45.184
Nobody's ever been this close
to Lucy Diamond before.

39:45.460 --> 39:49.692
You, for all intents and purposes,
are our leading expert.

39:50.799 --> 39:53.097
I don't think I'm an expert at all.

39:53.969 --> 39:56.028
You underestimate yourself.

39:57.339 --> 40:00.866
I took the liberty of accessing
your private files.

40:01.043 --> 40:03.511
-What?
-"It's a Man's World:

40:03.679 --> 40:08.514
Lucy Diamond and the Psychology
of Cultural Criminality."

40:08.784 --> 40:10.479
-Oh, God.
-"Lucy Diamond...

40:10.652 --> 40:15.112
...is at once a narcissistic sociopath
and a victimized girl-child...

40:15.290 --> 40:17.986
...eternally searching for
the love of her father.

40:18.160 --> 40:21.960
Her crimes could be viewed
as a desperate cry for help.

40:22.130 --> 40:27.625
The more she steals,
the deeper her feeling of emptiness."

40:31.973 --> 40:34.066
-Annie--
-Amy.

40:34.242 --> 40:37.734
I think you identify
with Lucy Diamond.

40:37.946 --> 40:41.712
I think she sees your pathos.

40:41.883 --> 40:45.683
You've got some dangerous
union symbiosis going on.

40:45.854 --> 40:49.915
What's that movie with Jodie and the
dog falls in the well with the lotion?

40:50.092 --> 40:52.754
<i>-Silence of the Lambs.</i>
-You're the lamb, Amy.

40:53.161 --> 40:56.062
We can use that to our advantage.

40:59.368 --> 41:01.734
I'm putting you in charge
of this investigation.

41:02.671 --> 41:03.968
What?

41:04.873 --> 41:08.036
You are hereby promoted
to squad captain.

41:08.243 --> 41:10.234
No.

41:10.412 --> 41:12.607
Is there a problem?

41:14.483 --> 41:17.008
Excuse me, ma'am, but I am
the captain of this squad.

41:17.185 --> 41:18.914
-Miss...?
-Brewer.

41:19.087 --> 41:23.786
Brewer. There is a killer on the loose.
There is no time for egos.

41:24.025 --> 41:27.483
This is not the Girl Scouts,
this is espionage!

41:29.231 --> 41:31.597
We have a chance
to do something here.

41:33.268 --> 41:36.135
You have a chance
to do something.

41:36.304 --> 41:38.602
Don't let us down.

41:41.576 --> 41:43.476
Ready your troops.

41:43.645 --> 41:46.113
You head out at 1400.

41:50.252 --> 41:52.015
That's all.

41:58.460 --> 42:00.121
Max!

42:02.464 --> 42:05.262
-Max. Max.
-What?

42:05.767 --> 42:09.294
I didn't mean for this to happen,
I swear. I don't even wanna be captain.

42:09.538 --> 42:12.439
That's just it.
You don't even want it.

42:12.607 --> 42:15.098
Boys fall at your feet, the school
kisses your ass...

42:15.277 --> 42:18.940
...and Mrs. Petrie makes you
squad captain.

42:19.781 --> 42:23.581
You'd be just as happy drawing
in your stupid little book.

42:24.085 --> 42:26.315
I don't understand why you have
to take away...

42:26.488 --> 42:29.480
...the only thing I have going for me.

42:29.691 --> 42:31.784
-Oh, Max--
-Just--

42:36.631 --> 42:38.155
Whatever.

42:38.834 --> 42:40.597
It's fine.

42:41.203 --> 42:44.695
-Just promise me one thing.
-What?

42:46.374 --> 42:47.966
You catch the bitch.

42:49.644 --> 42:55.378
Lucy Diamond's on the move!
Robbery in progress! Code 99!

43:12.601 --> 43:14.831
<i>The bank employees</i>
<i>are being held hostage.</i>

43:15.003 --> 43:17.301
<i>Lucy and her cohorts</i>
<i>are still inside.</i>

43:17.472 --> 43:19.997
<i>Apprehend the suspect,</i>
<i>recover the money.</i>

43:20.175 --> 43:22.006
<i>The bank is coming up</i>
<i>on your left.</i>

43:22.177 --> 43:24.304
<i>D.E.B.S., be careful.</i>

43:31.119 --> 43:33.144
<i>D.E.B.S. spotted en route.</i>
<i>E TA two minutes.</i>

43:33.321 --> 43:35.186
Copy that.

43:42.669 --> 43:45.069
D.E.B.S. en route, two minutes.

43:45.805 --> 43:47.898
Do I look okay?

43:48.641 --> 43:50.836
This is retarded.

44:01.487 --> 44:03.887
-Bradshaw?
-What?

44:04.924 --> 44:06.721
The plan?

44:06.893 --> 44:09.487
Oh, okay. Formation
Alpha Kappa Gamma.

44:13.066 --> 44:15.193
Let's do this!

44:51.738 --> 44:53.831
What was that?

44:54.407 --> 44:56.272
She's here.

44:56.609 --> 44:58.770
She's watching us.

44:58.945 --> 45:00.970
Jesus.

45:05.351 --> 45:06.784
<i>Come here.</i>

45:06.953 --> 45:08.545
<i>I can't.</i>

45:08.721 --> 45:11.383
-Come here.
<i>-I can't.</i>

45:12.992 --> 45:14.619
What are you doing?

45:14.794 --> 45:16.989
Nothing. Let's go.

45:30.676 --> 45:32.769
We'll be right back.

45:39.318 --> 45:41.878
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

45:43.122 --> 45:45.352
-What?
-It's a trap.

45:45.525 --> 45:48.255
-Whatever.
-Wait!

45:49.028 --> 45:50.893
Why are you giving me
such a hard time?

45:52.431 --> 45:53.955
This is great.

45:54.133 --> 45:57.000
If you're gonna do the job,
do the job right.

45:57.170 --> 46:01.163
Creepy shadows, no bad guys,
enclosed space. Trap.

46:03.142 --> 46:05.940
-You think I can't handle it?
-No.

46:06.112 --> 46:08.546
I know that you can't handle it.

46:08.948 --> 46:11.439
I don't care if you are
the perfect score.

46:11.617 --> 46:13.517
Perfect whore.

46:13.953 --> 46:18.890
You wouldn't know Alpha Gamma
if it was tattooed on your forehead.

46:19.058 --> 46:22.186
-Guys.
-This is stupid. We are going to die.

46:22.361 --> 46:25.125
No, it's okay.

46:25.298 --> 46:27.493
As your senior officer...

46:27.767 --> 46:31.931
...I order you
to secure the vault, soldier.

46:33.172 --> 46:36.733
-You order me?
-You heard me.

46:39.478 --> 46:41.378
Fine.

46:52.225 --> 46:53.749
See, that wasn't so hard.

46:53.960 --> 46:56.190
I think you guys owe me an ap--

47:01.968 --> 47:03.026
Trap.

47:07.373 --> 47:10.865
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to apologize for last night.

47:11.043 --> 47:13.238
I was-- I was out of line.

47:13.412 --> 47:16.245
-You have to release them.
-Who?

47:17.550 --> 47:19.780
The hostages.
And put back the money.

47:19.986 --> 47:22.511
This thing has gotten
way out of hand.

47:22.722 --> 47:26.283
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

47:30.296 --> 47:32.423
Please don't smoke.

47:32.999 --> 47:34.591
Please?

47:37.770 --> 47:40.568
Oh, my God,
tell her not to smoke.

47:40.773 --> 47:43.469
There's not enough oxygen.
We're gonna run out of air...

47:43.643 --> 47:45.304
...and we're gonna be all faint...

47:45.511 --> 47:48.708
...and the air that's gonna be left
is gonna be toxic.

48:00.760 --> 48:02.751
This is bullshit.

48:03.129 --> 48:06.155
This cannot get any worse.

48:08.167 --> 48:09.327
Trap.

48:09.568 --> 48:11.934
Don't you understand?
I can't be here.

48:12.104 --> 48:14.402
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to stress you out.

48:14.573 --> 48:15.801
I'm not stressed out!

48:17.043 --> 48:19.568
-No. No!
-This is not possible.

48:19.779 --> 48:21.838
I'm such a freak.
You must think I'm a freak.

48:22.048 --> 48:24.414
-I don't.
-I'm sorry I wigged out last night.

48:24.583 --> 48:25.811
-It's okay.
-It's just...

48:25.985 --> 48:28.818
...I don't want you to get
the wrong idea.

48:31.123 --> 48:33.182
-Yeah, okay.
-I mean....

48:33.359 --> 48:35.691
-I mean, I really like you.
-Right.

48:35.861 --> 48:41.163
But I don't, like, like you.

48:43.803 --> 48:46.829
Yeah. Yeah, I gathered.

48:47.006 --> 48:50.271
That's why I brought you here,
so we could clear the air between us.

48:50.443 --> 48:53.537
It's really sweet of you
to go to all this trouble...

48:53.713 --> 48:58.173
...the chute and all. But my friends
are gonna wonder where I am.

48:58.351 --> 49:00.285
-No, they're not.
-Why?

49:00.453 --> 49:02.284
No reason.

49:03.522 --> 49:05.149
Lucy!

49:05.624 --> 49:08.525
-Going to be squashed!
-Oh, no! Oh, no!

49:08.728 --> 49:10.320
-Oh, my God. Lucy!
-Come on.

49:10.496 --> 49:12.828
It's not like they're gonna die
or anything.

49:13.032 --> 49:16.798
No! No! Oh, no!

49:16.969 --> 49:18.800
Let them out. I'm serious.

49:19.005 --> 49:22.873
Okay. Jesus. Booby trap
deactivated. Happy?

49:30.049 --> 49:31.812
That wasn't funny.

49:31.984 --> 49:33.508
It was kind of funny.

49:35.254 --> 49:37.017
I can't.

49:38.924 --> 49:41.893
-I gotta go.
-No, no, I'll go.

49:43.763 --> 49:46.823
I understand this whole thing
isn't gonna work out between us...

49:46.999 --> 49:51.197
...because, obviously, I misinterpreted
the whole situation. But....

49:53.372 --> 49:57.775
I just want you to know that last night
was the most alive I've felt in a while.

49:58.277 --> 50:02.646
So I guess I'll see you around.
Same Bat-time or whatever.

50:18.297 --> 50:20.458
Come with me.

50:21.734 --> 50:23.793
Come on.
What do you have to lose?

50:25.071 --> 50:26.936
Everything.

50:49.762 --> 50:52.629
Oh, my gosh.
Lucy Diamond has Amy.

50:52.798 --> 50:55.392
You guys, she's been kidnapped.

50:58.804 --> 51:00.601
A D.E.B. is down.

51:01.207 --> 51:03.505
We will spare no expense.

51:03.709 --> 51:05.939
We will leave no rock unturned.

51:06.112 --> 51:11.209
We will not rest until we see
that she comes back safely.

51:18.491 --> 51:20.425
No, no!

51:37.309 --> 51:40.301
<i>No way! Are you... ?</i>

51:40.513 --> 51:41.980
<i>I know.</i>

51:52.258 --> 51:53.987
Amy, where are you?

51:54.160 --> 51:56.219
I know you're out playing hooky
with Lucy...

51:56.395 --> 51:59.990
...but they have the whole school
looking for you. Bobby, everybody.

52:00.166 --> 52:01.394
Call me.

52:01.567 --> 52:05.003
You know where she is?
Do you know where she is?

52:05.171 --> 52:07.537
How about this?
Do you wanna answer me?

52:15.214 --> 52:18.183
Amy, oh, my God, if you don't
come back, I'm telling.

52:18.350 --> 52:21.808
I am telling your mother. I'm calling
her and telling her right now.

52:51.183 --> 52:56.120
Seriously, Amy, I'm sorry I left
such a mean message. Just....

52:58.190 --> 53:00.886
Please, come home.

53:13.372 --> 53:16.432
So then this mysterious man
shows up at my high school...

53:16.609 --> 53:18.873
...and hands me this letter
which is, like:

53:19.044 --> 53:22.480
"Congratulations, you've just been
accepted into Jameson University."

53:22.648 --> 53:26.448
And I'm like, "I didn't apply
to Jameson University."

53:26.619 --> 53:29.782
The government's
freaky that way.

53:29.955 --> 53:31.547
Yeah.

53:33.859 --> 53:37.989
So, what does it measure,
this secret test in the SAT?

53:38.163 --> 53:40.154
I don't know.

53:41.867 --> 53:46.133
-You never asked?
-No. It measures spy stuff.

53:49.241 --> 53:51.607
-What?
-It's just weird that you let...

53:51.777 --> 53:55.770
...this test decide what you're gonna
be, and you don't even know what it is.

53:56.315 --> 54:00.809
It doesn't decide what I'm gonna be.
It's an aptitude test.

54:01.320 --> 54:04.653
It measures aptitude, I guess.

54:04.890 --> 54:06.517
Okay.

54:06.692 --> 54:10.025
-You should do what you're good at.
-No, you should do what you love.

54:10.195 --> 54:11.992
I am doing what I love.

54:12.164 --> 54:15.156
-Why are you psychoanalyzing me?
-I'm not psychoanalyzing you.

54:15.334 --> 54:18.770
I mean, just because I'm not
some badass master criminal...

54:18.937 --> 54:21.371
...doesn't mean that
what I do is not important.

54:21.540 --> 54:24.703
-I didn't say it wasn't important.
-Do you love a life of crime?

54:24.910 --> 54:27.708
-Yeah, I do.
-So you get a kick out of...

54:27.913 --> 54:30.711
...taking money from hard-working,
honest people.

54:30.916 --> 54:32.383
-What is your problem?
-I just--

54:32.551 --> 54:35.486
-I don't think you should judge me.
-I'm not.

54:35.654 --> 54:38.487
I'm not the one that got picked
out of a gajillion people...

54:38.657 --> 54:41.785
...to be Miss Super-Duper
Crime-Fighting Goody-Two-Shoes.

54:42.061 --> 54:44.859
I've never been perfect at anything.

54:49.168 --> 54:50.795
Look...

54:51.303 --> 54:55.296
...I didn't even wanna be a criminal.
I wanted to be a pirate.

54:57.376 --> 54:59.936
Pirates are criminals.

55:01.714 --> 55:03.306
Whoops.

55:03.515 --> 55:07.042
I wanted to go to art school.

55:07.519 --> 55:09.384
-Art school?
-In Barcelona.

55:09.755 --> 55:12.383
-You should go, you should do it.
-Maybe.

55:13.158 --> 55:16.855
After I make the world safe
from people like you.

55:21.500 --> 55:23.525
I don't know what the test saw in me.

55:23.702 --> 55:28.537
Everybody thinks I am gonna
make this perfect spy but me.

55:30.109 --> 55:32.475
I guess I'm proving them
all wrong now.

55:35.848 --> 55:38.248
Is that what you're doing with me?

55:38.417 --> 55:39.748
Sabotaging your spy career?

55:39.985 --> 55:44.012
I'm here because I feel more
like me when I'm with you...

55:45.057 --> 55:48.493
...than I do when I'm with me.

55:49.728 --> 55:51.593
Look, let's just...

55:51.764 --> 55:53.891
...forget we're here, okay?

55:54.066 --> 55:56.762
Let's pretend we're in Barcelona,
you're in art school...

55:56.935 --> 55:59.267
...and I'm renting sailboats
to tourists.

56:00.372 --> 56:04.866
And nobody is a superhero,
nobody is a villain, we're just us.

56:31.069 --> 56:33.333
Max here.
This better be really good.

56:34.339 --> 56:38.241
<i>-You are the D.E.B.S. ?</i>
-Who is this?

56:38.911 --> 56:41.471
I know where your friend is.

56:42.047 --> 56:44.311
We've got a lead on Amy. Let's go.

56:49.121 --> 56:51.055
Oh, no, no, no....

56:57.095 --> 56:59.188
Get your ass over here.

56:59.832 --> 57:01.857
We got a lead on Amy.

57:03.368 --> 57:06.428
And no boys upstairs
after curfew.

57:07.473 --> 57:09.464
Out.

57:11.610 --> 57:13.840
Pick up, pick up, pick up....

57:34.399 --> 57:36.890
-My God. I'm so sorry.
-Did you just snap my bra?

57:37.135 --> 57:38.363
-No.
-Yeah, you did.

57:49.848 --> 57:53.978
-That hasn't happened since 6th grade.
-I was trying to be smooth.

57:55.254 --> 57:57.620
-What? You did it first.
-You're dead.

58:01.660 --> 58:05.391
And bingo!
I am the god of Bingo.

58:05.697 --> 58:07.494
Breach.

58:17.175 --> 58:21.077
Bingo. Bingo. Bingo.

58:21.246 --> 58:23.214
Bingo!

58:29.688 --> 58:30.746
Damn it!

58:30.956 --> 58:34.392
-Say mercy. Come on. Say mercy.
-No. No. No.

58:36.428 --> 58:38.089
-Do you give? Do you gi--?
-No.

58:43.702 --> 58:45.897
Do you love me?

58:47.239 --> 58:48.536
Yes.

58:57.215 --> 58:58.876
Come on.

59:00.986 --> 59:03.682
What the hell?

59:03.889 --> 59:05.982
I couldn't stop them.

59:06.191 --> 59:08.819
-You look nice.
-Thanks.

59:08.994 --> 59:10.154
What?

59:10.329 --> 59:12.820
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

59:14.499 --> 59:16.126
Let's go.

59:16.301 --> 59:17.825
Sorry.

59:50.936 --> 59:53.029
Oh, God.

59:55.140 --> 59:57.631
It is not what you think.

01:00:07.019 --> 01:00:09.385
I hope it was worth it.

01:00:11.556 --> 01:00:15.014
You really should
check your messages.

01:00:22.801 --> 01:00:24.962
Look, it'll be okay.

01:00:26.505 --> 01:00:28.336
No, it won't.

01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:54.331
This is a nightmare.

01:00:54.499 --> 01:00:57.366
This is--
This is not happening.

01:01:09.614 --> 01:01:11.411
Are you kidding me?

01:01:11.583 --> 01:01:14.074
We conduct a nationwide
manhunt for you...

01:01:14.252 --> 01:01:16.015
...and you're boning the suspect?

01:01:16.421 --> 01:01:19.288
What did you think this was,
a joke?

01:01:19.458 --> 01:01:23.394
"Let's divert federal resources
and man-hours...

01:01:23.562 --> 01:01:26.360
...so I can have my collegiate
lesbian fling in style."

01:01:26.531 --> 01:01:28.863
I was doing research.

01:01:29.034 --> 01:01:31.025
I'll bet.

01:01:32.771 --> 01:01:36.571
Treason. Consorting
with the enemy.

01:01:36.742 --> 01:01:39.040
Aiding and abetting.

01:01:39.377 --> 01:01:43.040
I'm going to be the laughingstock
of the entire intelligence community.

01:01:43.215 --> 01:01:46.810
I am going to send you
so far away...

01:01:46.985 --> 01:01:50.045
...that luxuries like
toilet paper and Diet Coke...

01:01:50.222 --> 01:01:52.782
...will be as a distant dream to you.

01:01:52.958 --> 01:01:54.721
Ms. Petrie.

01:01:56.361 --> 01:01:57.623
Is somebody talking to me?

01:01:57.796 --> 01:02:00.321
Because that would be extremely
ill-advised right now.

01:02:00.499 --> 01:02:03.491
Ms. Petrie, this infraction is
a considerable embarrassment...

01:02:03.668 --> 01:02:07.399
-...to you and the academy, right?
-Have I not been speaking in English?

01:02:07.572 --> 01:02:10.598
Well, there is a way that
we can turn it all around.

01:02:11.443 --> 01:02:13.138
Explain.

01:02:13.478 --> 01:02:16.606
Make Amy D.E.B. of the year
next week at endgame.

01:02:17.816 --> 01:02:20.011
Nobody knows
what happened tonight but us.

01:02:20.585 --> 01:02:25.181
What good would it do to send
Amy to Siberia? Nothing.

01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:30.657
Your pride and joy will be disgraced,
and for what?

01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:33.923
Exactly.
So here's what we're gonna do.

01:02:34.099 --> 01:02:35.999
Tomorrow we're gonna go
to class...

01:02:36.168 --> 01:02:38.762
...and we're gonna report
that we rescued Amy...

01:02:38.937 --> 01:02:40.768
...just in the nick of time.

01:02:40.939 --> 01:02:43.999
And Amy is gonna act
traumatized but cool.

01:02:44.176 --> 01:02:47.703
And she will go to endgame
on Saturday with Bobby.

01:02:47.946 --> 01:02:50.847
And she'll give a speech
about how she battled Lucy...

01:02:51.016 --> 01:02:53.541
...and lived to fight another day.

01:02:53.718 --> 01:02:58.655
And you, Ms. Petrie, will get
another feather in your cap.

01:02:59.057 --> 01:03:02.185
And we don't lose a valued member
of our team.

01:03:03.061 --> 01:03:05.222
But she's obviously in love
with our nemesis.

01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:08.888
How can I make sure
she won't run off again?

01:03:09.067 --> 01:03:11.365
Well, let's ask her.

01:03:16.308 --> 01:03:18.469
The Amy that I know...

01:03:18.643 --> 01:03:23.706
...wouldn't sell out her friends
and her country for some supervillain.

01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:26.317
The Amy that I know...

01:03:26.484 --> 01:03:28.679
...she must have been
brainwashed or something.

01:03:28.854 --> 01:03:34.053
Maybe Lucy was doing some type
of experiments with mind control.

01:03:34.459 --> 01:03:38.225
Because the Amy that I know
would never...

01:03:38.997 --> 01:03:41.227
...ever betray us like that.

01:03:43.501 --> 01:03:46.766
You didn't know
what you were doing, right?

01:03:46.972 --> 01:03:48.337
Right.

01:03:48.506 --> 01:03:50.770
And there's no way
that you're in love with her?

01:03:51.243 --> 01:03:53.677
No. No way.

01:03:55.547 --> 01:03:56.946
Good.

01:03:57.115 --> 01:03:59.174
-You'll keep her secret?
-Are you kidding?

01:03:59.618 --> 01:04:01.210
No way I'm telling.

01:04:03.989 --> 01:04:08.289
Perhaps we can chalk this up
to the indiscretions of youth.

01:04:12.063 --> 01:04:14.964
I underestimated you, Brewer.
Good work.

01:04:15.133 --> 01:04:17.465
I'll remember this
when I review applications...

01:04:17.636 --> 01:04:19.194
...for the International Bureau.

01:04:19.371 --> 01:04:22.067
Have Miss Bradshaw vetted
for information she may have...

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.707
...on Diamond's whereabouts.

01:04:24.075 --> 01:04:27.442
She is to be placed on
round-the-clock lockdown...

01:04:27.612 --> 01:04:31.013
...only out for missions and class.

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:35.713
Be grateful you have friends
who care for you.

01:04:35.887 --> 01:04:38.617
Too bad it's more
than they can say for you.

01:04:43.895 --> 01:04:45.328
-Max--
-No.

01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:47.225
D.E.B.S. stick together.

01:04:47.432 --> 01:04:50.265
But do not misunderstand me,
I do not forgive you.

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:53.570
-Max.
-And you.

01:04:53.738 --> 01:04:55.228
I don't even wanna look at you.

01:04:55.407 --> 01:04:58.968
You let me go on this whole time
believing that she was in trouble.

01:04:59.144 --> 01:05:02.307
You can forget about
that recommendation.

01:05:05.951 --> 01:05:09.250
Well, you're not
as boring as I thought...

01:05:09.554 --> 01:05:13.320
...but you are not as bright either.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.360
-Bobby--
-Don't.

01:05:19.631 --> 01:05:22.930
Janet, I am so sorry.

01:05:23.101 --> 01:05:26.537
All I ever wanted
was to earn my stripes.

01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:31.165
Because I believe in it, you know?
I believe in what we do.

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:34.376
And now....

01:05:43.888 --> 01:05:48.018
-Where is Lucy now?
-I don't know.

01:05:48.193 --> 01:05:50.491
Are you gonna see her again?

01:06:36.141 --> 01:06:37.870
Hey.

01:06:38.043 --> 01:06:39.533
Hey.

01:06:41.046 --> 01:06:45.039
So you and me going
to endgame together?

01:06:45.216 --> 01:06:47.275
Yeah. I guess.

01:06:50.155 --> 01:06:52.180
I still love you.

01:06:52.357 --> 01:06:54.587
I know you still love me too.

01:07:00.298 --> 01:07:01.925
Yeah.

01:07:08.606 --> 01:07:11.700
My dad got this on a drug bust
in Malaysia.

01:07:13.978 --> 01:07:15.240
Listen...

01:07:15.413 --> 01:07:17.381
...l've been thinking.

01:07:18.183 --> 01:07:20.276
That whole lezzy thing...

01:07:20.452 --> 01:07:22.886
...it's kind of hot.

01:07:23.054 --> 01:07:25.215
See you tonight, babe.

01:07:36.201 --> 01:07:38.499
You did the right thing.

01:07:47.078 --> 01:07:48.602
Hey.

01:07:49.781 --> 01:07:51.442
How do you do that?

01:07:51.616 --> 01:07:54.847
For a top-secret installation,
your security really is for shit.

01:07:55.086 --> 01:07:58.021
-You can't be here.
-Oh, I know.

01:07:58.223 --> 01:08:00.691
You say you can't see me,
and then I see you anyway.

01:08:00.859 --> 01:08:04.090
-It's kind of this little game we play.
-Get out.

01:08:04.295 --> 01:08:06.490
Is this about your friends?
Because if it is...

01:08:06.664 --> 01:08:08.495
...I can just talk to them, you know.

01:08:08.666 --> 01:08:10.361
We can work out some sort
of détente.

01:08:10.535 --> 01:08:12.594
-I said, get out. I'm warning you.
-Amy.

01:08:17.142 --> 01:08:18.871
You have to go now.

01:08:21.845 --> 01:08:26.145
It's your stupid friends. Why don't you
just think for yourself for a change.

01:08:36.861 --> 01:08:38.453
She's gone.

01:08:38.863 --> 01:08:40.888
Are you okay?

01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:46.897
I thought you were different!

01:09:01.286 --> 01:09:05.654
She thinks I'm bad news?
Oh, I'll give her bad news.

01:09:11.196 --> 01:09:14.221
-What are you doing?
-Australia's toast.

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:17.493
-What's wrong with Australians?
-I don't like their attitude.

01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:20.536
Okay. Hey, come on.

01:09:33.218 --> 01:09:35.845
Scud, I don't know how this
happened to me, but...

01:09:36.955 --> 01:09:39.389
...being bad doesn't
feel good anymore.

01:09:40.959 --> 01:09:42.950
Do you love her?

01:09:47.966 --> 01:09:51.299
You're willing to give up all this...

01:09:51.469 --> 01:09:54.961
...the life of crime,
the whole nine yards?

01:09:56.274 --> 01:09:58.333
Whatever it takes.

01:10:01.045 --> 01:10:02.910
All right, then.

01:10:03.081 --> 01:10:04.810
We're going in.

01:10:04.983 --> 01:10:06.712
What?

01:10:07.285 --> 01:10:09.651
We gots to get her back.

01:10:25.236 --> 01:10:27.466
<i>In a remarkable twist,</i>
<i>sums of stolen money...</i>

01:10:27.639 --> 01:10:29.630
<i>...have been reappearing</i>
<i>in bank accounts.</i>

01:10:29.807 --> 01:10:33.402
<i>Authorities are trying to determine</i>
<i>the location of these wire transfers...</i>

01:10:33.578 --> 01:10:35.910
<i>...however, have been unsuccessful</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:39.233
<i>The Louvre received a surprise</i>
<i>package this morning...</i>

01:11:39.444 --> 01:11:43.642
<i>...a shipment of stolen paintings</i>
<i>estimated to be worth $ 15 million.</i>

01:11:43.815 --> 01:11:47.182
<i>Insider sources say that the artwork</i>
<i>was originally taken...</i>

01:11:47.352 --> 01:11:50.344
<i>...by notorious supervillain</i>
<i>Lucy Diamond.</i>

01:12:22.553 --> 01:12:25.021
She's out there somewhere.

01:12:26.691 --> 01:12:28.556
It's time for plan B.

01:12:28.726 --> 01:12:31.752
-There's a plan B?
-Yeah.

01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:41.265
-Getting ready for tonight?
-Hey, Mr. P.

01:12:44.509 --> 01:12:47.501
Tell me, Amy,
how are you getting along?

01:12:47.912 --> 01:12:50.039
Okay, I guess.

01:12:51.416 --> 01:12:53.543
You know, I've found
that in this business...

01:12:53.718 --> 01:12:56.448
...there isn't much room for love.

01:12:56.621 --> 01:12:59.784
Love requires trust,
and trust requires honesty.

01:13:03.528 --> 01:13:06.497
-Mr. P., can I ask you a question?
-Of course.

01:13:06.664 --> 01:13:09.724
I got a perfect score
on the secret test in the SAT.

01:13:09.901 --> 01:13:11.892
-Yes, you did.
-But...

01:13:12.069 --> 01:13:14.594
-...what does that test measure?
-I'm sorry?

01:13:14.772 --> 01:13:17.570
I mean, Dominique
is a sex addict.

01:13:17.975 --> 01:13:21.467
Janet, she has a couple
of shoplifting convictions.

01:13:21.646 --> 01:13:23.944
Max? Well, she's
borderline psychotic.

01:13:24.148 --> 01:13:28.608
But nothing in my past indicated
that I'd be good at being a spy.

01:13:29.821 --> 01:13:31.015
So...

01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:33.680
...why did I get a perfect score?

01:13:36.828 --> 01:13:39.991
The test measures
your ability to lie.

01:13:41.299 --> 01:13:43.631
You are a perfect liar.

01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:48.698
Don't get me wrong.
Perfect liars make perfect spies.

01:13:48.873 --> 01:13:52.138
The rest we can teach,
but subterfuge...

01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:54.210
...that comes naturally.

01:13:56.781 --> 01:13:59.773
Look, have fun tonight.

01:14:00.451 --> 01:14:03.352
Endgame only happens
once a year.

01:14:04.355 --> 01:14:06.380
Enjoy yourself.

01:14:40.424 --> 01:14:43.825
-Okay, what's the plan?
-There's security here, here and here.

01:14:43.995 --> 01:14:47.260
We'll infiltrate through the rooftop
and take out the guards here.

01:14:47.431 --> 01:14:50.025
Through the vents,
rappel down the elevator shaft...

01:14:50.201 --> 01:14:52.931
...and then bungee-jump
down to the dance floor.

01:14:53.137 --> 01:14:55.128
Okay, check. What next?

01:14:59.076 --> 01:15:02.011
"Tell her that you love her."
Scud, that's your plan?

01:15:02.179 --> 01:15:06.013
-That's not a plan!
-War is easy. Love is hard.

01:15:07.285 --> 01:15:08.684
Okay, so how's this?

01:15:08.853 --> 01:15:10.718
"My tour of duty
behind enemy lines...

01:15:10.888 --> 01:15:13.618
...has taught me to remain
vigilant to my core values:

01:15:13.791 --> 01:15:16.954
Bravery, loyalty and justice.

01:15:17.161 --> 01:15:20.221
And so it is a great honor
for me to accept this award...."

01:15:20.398 --> 01:15:21.695
Blah, blah, blah.

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:25.266
What if she really loves her?

01:15:25.937 --> 01:15:28.929
I mean, what if Lucy
makes her happy?

01:15:30.808 --> 01:15:34.938
If you were really her best friend,
you'd probably let her go.

01:15:36.681 --> 01:15:39.172
You can't decide
matters of the heart.

01:15:39.684 --> 01:15:41.481
It is madness to try.

01:15:43.321 --> 01:15:45.380
It's time.

01:15:59.136 --> 01:16:01.229
Okay, so I just wrote down
a couple words...

01:16:01.405 --> 01:16:03.498
...explaining our version
of what happened...

01:16:03.708 --> 01:16:06.768
...and expressing your gratitude
at being honored.

01:16:06.944 --> 01:16:08.502
And...

01:16:08.846 --> 01:16:11.314
...l'm sorry that we've been fighting.

01:16:11.482 --> 01:16:13.643
It's just I really want
what's best for you.

01:16:14.218 --> 01:16:15.845
I know.

01:16:18.356 --> 01:16:20.517
All right. Your speech.

01:16:36.941 --> 01:16:39.034
Attention, D.E.B.S.!

01:16:39.243 --> 01:16:40.835
Dudes!

01:16:45.149 --> 01:16:46.673
Once in a blue moon...

01:16:47.118 --> 01:16:49.279
...an exceptional young lady
comes along...

01:16:49.487 --> 01:16:55.050
...who truly exemplifies
what it means to be a D.E.B.

01:16:55.259 --> 01:16:59.127
Discipline. Energy. Beauty.

01:16:59.997 --> 01:17:03.160
Lucy Diamond's been spotted
infiltrating the--

01:17:08.706 --> 01:17:11.402
Secure every entrance
to this place, every floor.

01:17:11.575 --> 01:17:15.136
Nobody gets in or out
without my say-so.

01:17:15.312 --> 01:17:17.007
Game over, Diamond.

01:17:17.181 --> 01:17:20.241
I have spent my life defending
this great country of ours...

01:17:20.418 --> 01:17:22.978
...and I have learned one thing:

01:17:23.154 --> 01:17:26.555
That sometimes
it's not on the battlefield...

01:17:26.724 --> 01:17:28.589
...where true courage is shown.

01:17:39.203 --> 01:17:43.367
Amy Bradshaw survived
one of the worst tragedies...

01:17:43.541 --> 01:17:46.271
...that could happen to a young lady.

01:17:46.444 --> 01:17:48.605
Kidnapped...

01:17:48.813 --> 01:17:51.543
...held hostage...

01:17:51.716 --> 01:17:53.684
...for seven terrible days.

01:17:53.884 --> 01:17:56.079
-Matthews here.
-We're not seeing her.

01:17:57.054 --> 01:17:58.544
Look again!

01:17:58.723 --> 01:18:03.922
What fears she may have known,
none of us can fully appreciate.

01:18:04.462 --> 01:18:07.795
But she has agreed to tell us
part of what she learned...

01:18:07.965 --> 01:18:10.024
...on her journey.

01:18:10.234 --> 01:18:16.571
It gives me great pleasure tonight
to give our greatest honor...

01:18:16.741 --> 01:18:18.902
...the Mary Jane...

01:18:19.076 --> 01:18:21.943
...to our very own perfect score...

01:18:23.147 --> 01:18:24.944
...Amy Bradshaw!

01:18:41.499 --> 01:18:43.490
Courage.

01:18:43.968 --> 01:18:46.163
"Courage" is a big word.

01:18:46.604 --> 01:18:48.595
I did not know what courage
meant to me...

01:18:48.773 --> 01:18:52.800
...until I endured
seven agonizing days...

01:18:52.977 --> 01:18:55.104
...in captivity...

01:18:55.946 --> 01:18:56.970
Go.

01:18:58.482 --> 01:19:03.010
...captured and held hostage
by a madwoman.

01:19:03.187 --> 01:19:05.917
-Report.
<i>-We've got nothing here.</i>

01:19:17.802 --> 01:19:19.997
It was a routine mission
gone terribly wrong.

01:19:27.812 --> 01:19:31.270
I was separated from my squad
and knocked unconscious.

01:19:37.521 --> 01:19:39.853
I awoke in the arms of the enemy.

01:20:15.192 --> 01:20:18.753
Just the sound of my own desperate
thoughts to keep me company.

01:20:19.563 --> 01:20:24.967
If there is corruption in this city,
Lucy Diamond is behind it.

01:20:26.770 --> 01:20:31.764
If there is indecency to be found,
she is the root.

01:20:32.042 --> 01:20:36.274
If there is evil in this world,
its name is Lucy Diamond.

01:20:41.752 --> 01:20:44.016
It's not until moments like this...

01:20:44.188 --> 01:20:46.782
...when you are forced
to take stock of yourself...

01:20:46.991 --> 01:20:50.483
...that you see what you are made of.

01:20:51.495 --> 01:20:53.429
It's not until moments like this...

01:20:53.597 --> 01:20:56.532
...when you have to remember
what's right and true...

01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:00.864
...because it's moments like this
when you discover...

01:21:01.038 --> 01:21:03.233
...what it truly means
to be a D.E.B.

01:21:14.418 --> 01:21:17.319
Which is why I can't accept
this award from you tonight.

01:21:17.521 --> 01:21:19.421
Because the truth is...

01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:24.789
...the time I spent with Lucy Diamond
were the happiest days of my life.

01:21:25.930 --> 01:21:29.661
And the only brave thing
I've done this whole time...

01:21:29.833 --> 01:21:31.562
...is what I'm doing now.

01:21:33.804 --> 01:21:36.398
So if you'll excuse me...

01:21:37.341 --> 01:21:39.741
...I have a date with the devil.

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:47.277
-Oh, my God!
-Was that in the speech?

01:21:47.785 --> 01:21:50.754
No, that's not in the speech.

01:22:02.199 --> 01:22:04.167
Son of a--

01:22:04.501 --> 01:22:08.198
Hostile has escaped and is on the run
heading towards sector 12.

01:22:23.821 --> 01:22:25.618
It's Lucy Diamond! She's here!

01:22:25.789 --> 01:22:27.848
Everybody, run for your lives!

01:22:37.167 --> 01:22:39.294
Let's do this.

01:22:53.884 --> 01:22:55.613
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:59.809
-We've gotta stop meeting like this.
-I'm so sorry. I didn't even know what--

01:24:02.086 --> 01:24:03.883
Get a room.

01:24:05.055 --> 01:24:07.956
-You are AWOL, soldier.
-Max, please.

01:24:08.125 --> 01:24:09.149
-Freeze!
-Scud!

01:24:09.326 --> 01:24:10.486
-Yeah?
-Not helping!

01:24:10.694 --> 01:24:12.457
-My bad.
-Can't you see...

01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:14.290
...she's breaking up the D.E.B.S.?

01:24:14.765 --> 01:24:16.892
What did I tell you
the first time I met you?

01:24:17.401 --> 01:24:20.165
High-protein diets were overrated.

01:24:20.337 --> 01:24:22.635
After that.

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:27.235
-That we'd always be friends.
-I meant it.

01:24:29.346 --> 01:24:31.143
Max!

01:24:42.092 --> 01:24:45.653
If you break her heart, I will
hunt you down and kill you.

01:24:48.665 --> 01:24:50.462
Deal.

01:24:56.607 --> 01:24:58.472
I'm counting on you
to keep her honest.

01:24:59.042 --> 01:25:00.600
I will.

01:25:06.150 --> 01:25:08.141
You guys better get going.

01:25:11.388 --> 01:25:13.652
I never really liked you...

01:25:13.824 --> 01:25:16.657
...but I'm sad to see you go.

01:25:21.298 --> 01:25:25.325
-So where are you going to?
-I think, Barcelona.

01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:28.135
I'll miss you.

01:25:29.306 --> 01:25:31.297
-Can I have your room?
-Sure.

01:25:32.676 --> 01:25:34.143
Okay.

01:25:37.814 --> 01:25:39.714
Rule the school.

01:25:39.883 --> 01:25:41.714
I always do.

01:25:47.991 --> 01:25:50.585
There's a service exit that way.

01:25:50.827 --> 01:25:52.488
Good luck.

01:25:54.198 --> 01:25:55.825
And, Amy...

01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:58.800
...be careful.

01:26:08.912 --> 01:26:11.904
-Which way did they go?
-They went that way.

01:26:27.631 --> 01:26:31.795
-Don't say I never gave you nothing.
-My stripes?

01:26:31.969 --> 01:26:34.529
-Really?
-Really.

01:26:35.239 --> 01:26:37.070
-Thank you!
-You're welcome.

01:26:37.241 --> 01:26:39.573
Okay, okay. That's enough,
that's enough.

01:26:39.743 --> 01:26:41.335
Okay.

01:26:42.613 --> 01:26:44.444
I was wondering
if maybe you wanted--

01:26:44.615 --> 01:26:46.276
Yes!

01:26:46.450 --> 01:26:48.213
I didn't ask you anything yet.

01:26:48.385 --> 01:26:50.649
Whatever it is, yes.

01:26:50.887 --> 01:26:52.912
Awesome.
