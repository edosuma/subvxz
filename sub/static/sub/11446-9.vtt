WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:02.870
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.003 --> 00:04.209
We will unite the clans,

00:04.338 --> 00:06.625
and I will lead you all to glory.

00:06.715 --> 00:09.753
Charles has landed in Scotland,
and he's gathering his army.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.208
<i>What will ye do, brother?</i>

00:11.345 --> 00:12.380
Whatever I can to save Lallybroch,

00:12.513 --> 00:15.130
Scotland,
and everything that we hold dear.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.965
I need you to bring
the men to Kingussie.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.140
As ye Say-

00:18.227 --> 00:19.638
<i>I'll meet you there in two weeks.</i>

00:19.728 --> 00:21.093
Colum, is Dougal with ye?

00:21.188 --> 00:24.397
'Twas best for the clan that
my brother remain at his own estate.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.517
To save our clans, our country,
we must band together.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.894
Let's just go to Prince Charles
with the men from Lallybroch.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.395
I canna go to the Prince a failure.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.194
It's our duty
to stand up for our country, Father.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.237
I will fight, even if you will not.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.987
Don't sit there gaping at me.
Go see to your men!

00:39.081 --> 00:40.116
I don't understand.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.619
What will you say about
your son fighting for the Jacobites?

00:42.709 --> 00:45.701
He's his own man, and that will
protect me if the British should win.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.762
<i>We left Beaufort Castle 100 strong</i>

02:27.856 --> 02:30.564
<i>and travelled toward Crieff
to join forces with Murtagh</i>

02:30.651 --> 02:32.187
<i>and the Lallybroch Frasers.</i>

02:33.153 --> 02:35.815
<i>But our numbers
dwindled along the way.</i>

02:35.906 --> 02:38.489
<i>Many who resented being
ordered by Lord Lovat</i>

02:38.575 --> 02:41.988
<i>from their families and farms
deserted our ranks.</i>

02:42.079 --> 02:45.322
<i>We'd sent Young Simon
to persuade them to return</i>

02:45.415 --> 02:48.328
<i>with the promise of land
when the war was over.</i>

02:48.960 --> 02:51.748
<i>It gave them something to fight for,</i>

02:51.838 --> 02:53.420
<i>to die for.</i>

02:53.507 --> 02:55.498
<i>If it went according to plan,</i>

02:55.634 --> 02:58.968
<i>all would meet up in Perth
to join the prince's army.</i>

03:04.267 --> 03:05.678
Murtagh.

03:05.811 --> 03:07.848
Pardon me if I forego the wee jig

03:07.979 --> 03:10.516
that I had planned
in honour of your arrival.

03:10.982 --> 03:14.020
I woulda been gey pleased
to foot it out five days ago.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.517
AYE, aye.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.696
It took us longer than foreseen
coming through Corrieyairack.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.318
Made me long
for the days of raiding cattle.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.111
I didna think ye could talk

03:26.206 --> 03:29.369
that old bastard out of a loaf
a bread, let alone men.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.123
Not much to look at, are they?

03:34.214 --> 03:37.798
Apparently Lovat's kept
his best men back at Beauly.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.716
So you two have your work
cut out for you.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.134
We need to keep a watch.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.555
Thirty-odd tried to desert
near Kingussie.

03:44.683 --> 03:48.142
Wee Simon's gone to bring them
back into the fold.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.139
- The Younger's with us?
- Aye.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.059
But no with his father's blessing.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.808
Lord Lovat remains neutral.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.064
Ah, that's the weasel I ken well.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.062
Wee dram to warm you up.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.905
- Thank you.
- Aye.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.234
Milady! Milord!

04:07.372 --> 04:08.908
Fergus, laddie,

04:09.040 --> 04:10.155
ye look fit.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.911
Murtagh's been looking
after you well, then?

04:12.043 --> 04:13.659
No, no, no. It's been horrible.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.916
He forced me to mend his socks
and to fetch his meals.

04:17.007 --> 04:20.341
Hey, I'm just tryna educate
the lad on the finer points

04:20.427 --> 04:22.043
on travelling in the Highlands.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.386
All right, children.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.633
I'll have a word with the ladies,

05:06.765 --> 05:09.473
try and get them to make them
as many bannocks as possible today.

05:09.601 --> 05:10.716
Aye.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.229
Mistress Claire,

05:15.315 --> 05:17.147
I washed my mouth out with whisky,

05:17.275 --> 05:19.937
in preparation for a big buss
from you, eh?

05:20.737 --> 05:22.227
Angus!

05:22.948 --> 05:24.438
Good to see some things
haven't changed.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.612
It's been ower long, Claire.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.450
- Indeed it has, Rupert.
- Hey.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.495
Well, where's Willie?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.456
Something happened?

05:42.801 --> 05:43.836
Tell them.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.463
The lad...

05:49.349 --> 05:51.340
He went and got himself married.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.351
To an Irish lass.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.849
Sailed off to America
with the bride's family.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.690
We'll no mention
that traitorous bastard's name again.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.480
You know,
marriage could do you all some good.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.942
Have ye no welcome
for yer beloved uncle?

06:06.616 --> 06:07.697
Dougal!

06:11.121 --> 06:12.361
Aye.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.446
- You look well, lad.
- Aye.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.202
Despite the misfortunes
ye've suffered.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.374
Never felt more fit.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.537
And the Lady Broch Tuarach.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.004
A vision of true loveliness.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.384
Well, it wouldn't be Scotland
without you, Dougal.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.799
Colum change his mind, then?

06:31.725 --> 06:33.557
Is the Clan MacKenzie
to join the cause?

06:33.685 --> 06:36.473
Colum's mind is his own.
It's no concern of mine.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.895
We are here to pledge our hearts

06:38.982 --> 06:41.849
and swords to the glorious cause.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.820
What, just the three of you?

06:46.907 --> 06:48.739
Well, ya didna question
my lads' strength in numbers

06:48.825 --> 06:50.315
when they stormed Wentworth Prison,

06:50.410 --> 06:52.242
in the very teeth
of over 200 Redcoats.

06:52.329 --> 06:53.410
It was 400, actually.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.699
More likely 500.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.330
Lad.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.999
When I heard you joined
the Jacobite cause,

07:00.754 --> 07:02.085
I was so proud.

07:02.213 --> 07:05.376
It was as if my own son
was taking his first steps as a man.

07:06.384 --> 07:09.342
Now, I know that you and I have had
our differences in the past,

07:09.429 --> 07:11.090
but I have been waiting for the day

07:11.222 --> 07:13.429
when we would fight
together on the same side.

07:13.558 --> 07:14.923
It is our time.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.267
For QIOTY-

07:18.229 --> 07:19.264
For Scotland.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.188
Then I welcome yer heart.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.768
- Aye.
- And yer sword.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.771
All of you, sorely needed.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.023
You can aid me in training
the other men.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.448
Aye, it should be
a simple enough matter.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.114
They've showed their worth
just by joining.

07:35.205 --> 07:38.288
Their hearts are larger
and stronger than 10 Redcoats.

07:38.416 --> 07:41.784
Maybe so, but they're no ready
for combat as they stand.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.877
Plenty of time to teach
that on the march.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.796
Well, they dinna march.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.372
They walk, they stroll,

07:47.467 --> 07:49.549
they caper about,
but they dinna march.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.719
They'll need to learn
before they join the prince's army.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.549
They're still just cotters,
tacksmen, smiths.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.806
Most havena even held a weapon,
let alone used one in a fight.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.063
Now, this is good
ground to train upon.

08:03.900 --> 08:04.981
So,

08:05.568 --> 08:08.651
I've decided to stay here for a time.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.321
Yer mind's set, then?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.107
Aye.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.483
'Tis.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.578
Good to see you
looking so braw, Dougal.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.285
All right.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.085
We'll make a fine group
of Highland soldiers.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.336
No time to waste.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.690
James Fraser taught me
these drills himself.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.188
And believe me,

08:53.324 --> 08:55.861
I am going to teach them to you,

08:55.952 --> 08:59.445
and you are going to learn them.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.120
Now, form lines.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.325
Two.

09:05.712 --> 09:06.873
When ye hear this...

09:11.885 --> 09:15.003
Two lines,
one directly next to the other.

09:15.847 --> 09:16.882
Here.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.881
Put yer toes there. Line.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.133
Get in line. Get in line!

09:21.227 --> 09:23.719
Kincaid, move yer arse.

09:24.397 --> 09:28.061
Do ye think the enemy's gonna fouter
away waiting for ye to gather?

09:30.361 --> 09:32.693
And when do we get
proper weapons, huh?

09:36.076 --> 09:39.068
First, you learn where to stand.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.662
Then you'll learn how to move.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.244
And if you can manage
the particulars of that,

09:44.375 --> 09:47.083
we'll put a sword in your hand
and teach ye to kill Redcoats.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.668
But until then...

09:48.755 --> 09:49.916
Form up!

09:53.593 --> 09:56.210
What are you laughing at, bastard?

10:03.269 --> 10:05.351
When ye hear this...

10:05.438 --> 10:07.179
Ye will face left.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.852
Facelefi.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.897
Yer own left!

10:13.029 --> 10:14.360
What is the matter with ye?

10:14.447 --> 10:15.778
Have ye got shite in your ears?

10:15.865 --> 10:16.946
Attention!

10:20.286 --> 10:22.118
Pay attention to me.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.114
File left. Quick, march.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.294
Ya, wee Fergus, get the ball!

10:35.426 --> 10:37.417
Okay, Fergus, show us what you got.

10:40.098 --> 10:44.057
Kincaid, ye swing like a big lass
and not a very bonnie one.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.393
<i>Coming for you, corporal.</i>

10:47.647 --> 10:48.728
All right.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.309
- Give that a swing.
- There you go.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.481
Right, yeah, yeah. You just want to
knock it out of the park.

10:55.572 --> 10:56.653
- All right?
- Okay.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.113
Mine!

11:00.827 --> 11:02.943
Fergus. Fergus.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.083
No need to get riled,
Mistress Claire.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.993
We were just playing.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.755
I asked you to get water
for Milord, did I not?

11:14.841 --> 11:16.832
- Yes, but I was just...
- I don't care.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.799
Just come with me.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.002
Keep your distance.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.013
Remember, these are well-trained,
disciplined soldiers.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.593
Come here, come here.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.096
Scottish broadsword.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.348
Ye aim for the shoulders
if ye're trying

11:33.443 --> 11:34.933
to take his head off, like that.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.692
Even every highly trained soldier
has a weakness.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.815
Halt! You there, I said "halt"!

11:43.453 --> 11:44.534
Come left!

11:47.540 --> 11:48.701
When ye're coming short distance,

11:48.833 --> 11:51.040
ye see that bastard's throat,
and ye stab it.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.208
Right, control.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.628
Throat, down scrape, aye.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.955
And then you smash 'em into pieces!

11:57.050 --> 12:00.042
You ought to practise
till it's in ye.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.716
The men are coming along nicely.

12:07.810 --> 12:11.144
We should push on,
join the prince with due haste.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.347
Christ.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.650
We must make
a show of our allegiance.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.398
I don't know who ye're surveying,

12:19.530 --> 12:22.238
but if we meet the British now,
you can count on one of two things.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.817
We get butchered in the field
or have our necks stretched.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.072
Ken it.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.075
Ye have the prince's ear, no?

12:30.208 --> 12:31.664
I ken Charles Stuart well enough.

12:31.751 --> 12:32.832
Ave. good,

12:32.919 --> 12:35.911
because more clans
are joining our cause every day.

12:36.047 --> 12:40.006
And their leaders are jockeying for
position within his inner council.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.174
We have more pressing concerns

12:41.261 --> 12:43.593
than worrying about securing
a seat at the prince's table.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.089
I'll no send these cotters
into battle

12:47.183 --> 12:49.925
until they're well-trained
and disciplined.

13:10.623 --> 13:14.241
Christ. Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.620
It's not exactly
Delmonico steak, is it?

13:18.256 --> 13:19.371
Ma'am?

13:19.757 --> 13:22.966
Well, that's what we think you Yanks
have for chow every day.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.383
Giant steaks,

13:24.470 --> 13:27.053
baked potatoes drowned in butter,

13:27.140 --> 13:28.881
tomatoes the size of cricket balls,

13:28.975 --> 13:32.468
and vats and vats
of chocolate ice cream.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.393
Don't I wish.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.643
We just get K-rations,
pretending to be real food.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.315
We call it "shit on a shingle."

13:39.444 --> 13:40.605
Sorry, ma'am.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.486
That's quite all right.

13:43.573 --> 13:44.904
I'm Claire Randall, by the way.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.483
Corporal Caleb Grant,
that's Private Max Lucas.

13:47.618 --> 13:48.779
Nice to meet you.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.736
Airborne?

13:52.498 --> 13:53.988
Separated from your unit?

13:55.168 --> 13:57.660
Yes, ma'am, ever since D-Day.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.624
There's quite
a lot of that going around.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.456
Where are you both from?

14:03.634 --> 14:05.090
Texarkana, Arkansas.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.760
Yonkers, New York.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.174
How about you?

14:08.348 --> 14:09.930
I'm from...

14:10.016 --> 14:11.757
Well, all over, really.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.933
I'm not sure where home is,
to be honest.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.020
Anywhere but here, that's for sure.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.774
Ma'am, can I ask you a question?

14:21.861 --> 14:25.445
What kind of food
is this trying to be?

14:26.699 --> 14:30.442
Well, that, Private Lucas,
is trying to be black pudding,

14:30.953 --> 14:32.785
though you would probably
call it sausage.

14:33.664 --> 14:36.031
Then what do you call
what we call pudding?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.291
Pudding.

14:39.629 --> 14:40.710
"The British and Americans,

14:40.838 --> 14:43.296
"two people separated
by a common language."

14:43.383 --> 14:44.544
George Bernard Shaw.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.046
That's right.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.969
My mama's Irish.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.468
She said he's one of the great
Irish writers of all time.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.798
Pop says he's a Communist.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.736
You all right, lass?

15:12.495 --> 15:14.202
Ye've been very quiet
these past few days.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.867
I'm fine.

15:18.918 --> 15:23.253
There's just so much to do,
to prepare for.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.005
Aye.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.784
"I am ready."

15:58.249 --> 15:59.535
I'm sorry.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.085
Sorry?

16:06.632 --> 16:08.373
Sorry for bringing you here.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.054
I want you to know,

16:19.395 --> 16:22.638
whatever happens,
we're gonna get through this.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.981
I'll make sure you're safe.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.232
I'm fine, Jamie.

16:31.782 --> 16:32.897
Really.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.006
About face.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.633
Together!

17:00.770 --> 17:02.761
By the left, quick!

17:03.147 --> 17:04.478
March!

17:06.526 --> 17:07.686
Halt!

17:08.944 --> 17:10.276
Halt!

17:10.780 --> 17:12.646
About face!

17:13.199 --> 17:15.190
Together, you clots, together!

17:17.619 --> 17:19.281
By the left!

17:19.372 --> 17:20.532
Quick!

17:20.623 --> 17:21.704
March!

17:25.836 --> 17:27.667
Halt! Halt!

17:28.339 --> 17:29.374
Now!

17:32.385 --> 17:33.875
Foolishness

17:34.554 --> 17:35.885
and games.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.633
That's what ye're thinking.

17:37.723 --> 17:41.387
No reason to learn to strut
and ponce about like the Redcoats.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.344
We're Scotsmen.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.307
We're brave, and we're strong,

17:49.735 --> 17:51.817
and we have God on our side,

17:51.904 --> 17:53.520
so why should we waste time
with all this shite?

17:54.532 --> 17:55.818
Aye.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.398
I was like-minded.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.492
Then I went to France,

17:59.579 --> 18:01.570
and I became a soldier.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.371
I saw what a modern,
well-trained army can do.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.744
It's a pretty sight at first.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.248
Seeing them all marching together
in their neat rows and columns,

18:13.342 --> 18:16.880
music playing, banners waving.

18:20.850 --> 18:23.433
So pretty, you want to smile.

18:24.562 --> 18:26.269
I laughed, too, the first time.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.402
Then they fired the first volley.

18:40.036 --> 18:44.280
First, you see
the flash of metal in the Sun.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.292
Together, as one,

18:50.379 --> 18:52.711
an entire line of men

18:52.798 --> 18:57.133
raise their muskets, aim,
and let loose.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.764
The musket balls
come tearing across the field

19:03.851 --> 19:06.718
like a sheet of metal rain,

19:06.812 --> 19:10.601
cutting down men left
and right without mercy.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.310
Sound of gunfire...

19:19.158 --> 19:21.650
Rolling thunder across the hills.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.577
By the time the last of it fades,

19:24.664 --> 19:27.702
the second volley
is already on its way.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.251
I realised

19:32.922 --> 19:35.163
it takes more than courage
to beat an army like that.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.132
It takes discipline.

19:39.762 --> 19:42.299
It takes a well-trained soldier.

19:42.973 --> 19:45.965
An army of soldiers.

19:47.311 --> 19:51.771
Now, if we have the discipline
to stand together, to march together,

19:51.857 --> 19:57.819
and to fight together, then by God,
I ken we will win together.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.042
Stand.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.665
- Stand!
- Halt!

20:15.297 --> 20:16.787
Come on!

20:19.176 --> 20:23.966
Hey! That's how you beat
the Redcoats, eh?

20:24.724 --> 20:26.761
With a Highland charge!

20:27.977 --> 20:30.514
Ye take them by surprise,

20:31.605 --> 20:34.142
and ye put terror in their hearts.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.478
Get back in line!

20:36.569 --> 20:37.775
Back in line now.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.023
Was only five of us.

20:39.113 --> 20:43.903
Aye, imagine 1,000 of us screaming,
descending on the pretty Redcoats

20:43.993 --> 20:45.358
lined up in a row.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.320
They'll run like chickens.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.746
We'd need surprise
for the charge to work.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.704
I doubt We'll be that lucky.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.540
Dismissed, all of you.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.421
Dismissed!

21:00.134 --> 21:01.420
Move it!

21:02.803 --> 21:04.293
Bloody sheep.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.510
A word with ye, Uncle.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.644
Listen, lad,

21:21.739 --> 21:23.571
I ken ye're trying to do
what ye think is best,

21:23.657 --> 21:25.022
but I was teaching men to fight

21:25.117 --> 21:26.528
when you were still sucking
your mother's tit,

21:26.619 --> 21:27.700
God rest her.

21:28.871 --> 21:30.578
So, I think I know a wee bit more
about this than you do.

21:30.664 --> 21:31.745
No.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.032
No, you don't.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.083
I ken what these men will face,

21:36.420 --> 21:39.333
and I know
how to prepare them for it.

21:39.423 --> 21:40.754
You don't.

21:41.759 --> 21:44.922
And these are my men, my clan.
They'll answer to me and no one else.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.467
What exactly
is it ye're trying say, lad?

21:48.974 --> 21:52.592
I've been tolerant with ye before now
because I respect you,

21:53.270 --> 21:54.886
because you're my uncle.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.018
But if you choose to fight
with Clan Fraser,

21:58.108 --> 22:01.317
then you'll respect my orders
without objection.

22:03.739 --> 22:07.152
If you can't abide to these terms,
take yer men and be on yer way.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.074
As you say.

22:49.410 --> 22:54.075
I've been giving some thought
to Jamie's situation.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.698
He's struggling.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.662
Needs help.

22:58.961 --> 23:00.747
But you know Jamie.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.417
He's too proud to ask.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.211
Well, if you spoke to him,

23:11.432 --> 23:15.676
made him realise that I can help,
if only he'd let me.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.351
Why would I do that?

23:17.438 --> 23:19.600
Because of our agreement,

23:20.524 --> 23:23.937
the one we made in the cave
at Glen Rowan Cross.

23:29.158 --> 23:31.741
I'll wager ye never told him
about that, did ye?

23:32.661 --> 23:34.698
About my generous offer to ye?

23:35.080 --> 23:37.242
To look after ye as yer husband?

23:37.583 --> 23:42.623
And yer promise to me
to be my bride if he died?

23:45.758 --> 23:49.126
My husband and I share everything.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.178
Oh, he knows about your "offer,"

23:53.641 --> 23:56.349
and he knows why I was forced
to make the decision I did.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.185
And he took no issue with it?

24:00.314 --> 24:01.475
None.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.441
Well, he...

24:06.278 --> 24:07.768
He is a better man than l.

24:11.033 --> 24:13.616
Truer words have never been spoken.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.536
I can see that
ye still bear a grudge.

24:17.081 --> 24:19.948
Let's get one thing clear,
Dougal MacKenzie.

24:20.042 --> 24:22.283
If I ever thought of you,

24:22.378 --> 24:25.416
then I might hold a grudge for all
the things that you've done to me.

24:25.506 --> 24:26.587
But I don't.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.039
Why?

24:28.926 --> 24:31.384
Because of your affliction,

24:31.470 --> 24:33.962
your inability to be selfless,

24:34.723 --> 24:37.806
because you suffer from narcissism.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.225
If you don't know what that is,
then let me tell you.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.724
The term comes from Greek mythology.

24:42.815 --> 24:46.900
Narcissus fell in love with his own
reflection in a pool of water

24:46.986 --> 24:49.444
and died rather
than pull himself away to eat.

24:51.323 --> 24:56.033
Your ego and your self-gratification
drive your desires.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.323
You want King James
restored to the throne,

24:58.414 --> 25:00.371
but not for Scotland.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.539
For your own selfishness.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.751
So, please,

25:05.838 --> 25:07.954
stop trying to convince
everyone of your patriotism.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.538
It's tedious.

25:10.884 --> 25:14.252
I'm not sure that you'll grasp
the meaning of this either,

25:14.346 --> 25:16.678
but I'll try my damnedest.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.381
Fuck yourself.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.099
All right, then.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.893
Claire.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.104
I'm sure I have earned it.

25:30.696 --> 25:31.857
I do.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.647
I do love my reflection.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.650
But make no mistake, lass.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.403
I love Scotland more.

25:41.415 --> 25:46.831
And I would give everything,
everything I have or ever will have,

25:46.920 --> 25:48.911
including my life,

25:49.006 --> 25:51.839
to see a Stuart back on the throne.

26:00.517 --> 26:01.973
Attack him. Attack him.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.428
He's no your friend, okay? Fight him!

26:05.105 --> 26:06.140
Halt!

26:08.192 --> 26:10.479
- Excellent. To the ground.
- Up, protect your head here.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.314
Come on, mean it!

26:12.404 --> 26:14.816
Good grip, down to the ground.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.863
I am starting to feel proud.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.035
That's it!

26:22.498 --> 26:23.954
Good.

26:30.964 --> 26:31.999
Fire!

26:33.300 --> 26:35.837
Good. Good. Reload!

26:40.933 --> 26:43.925
They canna seem to grasp
how to load properly.

26:45.646 --> 26:49.640
Aye, and a British trooper
can get off three shots a minute.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.940
We must teach 'em to be better.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.028
Go again.

26:59.368 --> 27:02.702
Have ye noticed
Claire's been out of sorts lately?

27:02.830 --> 27:05.117
One day she seems fine,
in good spirits,

27:05.916 --> 27:08.408
and the next there's
barely any life in her.

27:08.669 --> 27:10.580
I canna figure it out.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.836
I can see she's not been herself.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.582
Claire doesn't usually
beat around the bush.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.343
She speaks her mind,
whether you want to hear it or not.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.003
Iasked.

27:21.098 --> 27:22.930
She claims she's fine.

27:24.768 --> 27:28.056
It's gonna takea bit more than asking
to pry it out of her.

27:32.025 --> 27:33.140
Come on, you two.

27:33.235 --> 27:34.521
Take aim!

27:34.611 --> 27:35.692
Fire!

27:37.156 --> 27:39.568
Got something growing
between yer toes there.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.446
Nay, just everyday filth.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.709
This is unacceptable.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.502
You could easily get trench foot.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.079
If you intend to use
these feet to march,

27:55.174 --> 27:56.790
then you need to
take better care of them.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.545
Well, I'll bear it.

27:59.761 --> 28:00.796
Bear it?

28:02.431 --> 28:05.969
Trench foot can lead to gangrene,
which can lead to amputation.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.016
I've seen it happen.

28:08.145 --> 28:11.012
Are you completely idiotic?
Is that what you want?

28:12.733 --> 28:14.315
It's a rhetorical question.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.944
Take off your other boot.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.696
Take it off.

28:23.619 --> 28:24.734
It's just...

28:25.078 --> 28:26.614
Come on, it's just...

28:30.834 --> 28:31.915
Come on.

28:33.295 --> 28:37.004
So, in summation,
make sure to dry your boots.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.422
Don't go to sleep in your socks.

28:39.509 --> 28:44.299
If your feet begin to swell,
then coat them in foot powder

28:44.389 --> 28:46.005
and let them air-dry.

28:46.099 --> 28:50.809
Move your legs, wiggle your toes,
anything to get the blood flowing.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.640
Are you listening?

29:00.280 --> 29:02.112
Did you hear what I fucking said?

29:09.206 --> 29:10.867
Aye, I heard ye.

29:45.575 --> 29:46.906
So she says to me,

29:46.994 --> 29:48.701
"Ye'll be expecting me
to open my legs."

29:48.787 --> 29:51.119
I says, "No, I'll just kick you on
the pot like everybody else."

29:55.043 --> 29:57.705
Hey. Hey. Easy, lads.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.412
It's just a pack of new recruits.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.510
How do 10 men just walk into the camp

30:10.600 --> 30:12.682
without so much as a challenge
from the sentries?

30:12.811 --> 30:15.929
I just smiled and waved,
and they let me pass.

30:16.023 --> 30:17.513
Who was on watch?

30:17.607 --> 30:19.268
Ross and Kincaid.

30:19.359 --> 30:20.815
Bring them to me.

30:22.696 --> 30:24.357
Post new guards in their place.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.359
Jamie, did ye no hear?

30:26.825 --> 30:29.408
I brought volunteers for our cause.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.536
Volunteers?

30:33.040 --> 30:34.155
Aye.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.207
Here of yer own freewill, are ye?

30:44.760 --> 30:46.592
Prepared to bleed, are ye?

30:50.015 --> 30:54.976
Prepared to leave your families and
your homes for months, maybe years?

30:59.107 --> 31:02.020
This isn't a war where you risk
no more than your lives in battle.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.061
No, no, this is treason.

31:05.947 --> 31:07.233
If We fail,

31:07.324 --> 31:09.782
then all those
that support the Stuarts

31:09.868 --> 31:11.233
are likely to end up on a scaffold.

31:11.328 --> 31:12.989
They're true Scots.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.664
Every man prepared to fight and die
for their true king.

31:16.750 --> 31:20.789
I much prefer they fight
and live for their king.

31:21.630 --> 31:24.793
I'm James Alexander
Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.

31:25.634 --> 31:26.840
I command this army.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.129
If you do not wish to be here,

31:28.220 --> 31:30.803
then it is my order that you
leave now and return to your homes.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.550
None will think less of you.

31:32.974 --> 31:34.806
No harm will follow.

31:44.861 --> 31:46.101
The rest of you are dismissed.

31:50.033 --> 31:52.274
The rest of us, he says.

32:04.965 --> 32:06.581
I thought you agreed
to follow orders.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.424
When did ye order me
not to recruit new men?

32:11.680 --> 32:14.047
We must conscript as we travel.

32:14.933 --> 32:19.222
We need every able-bodied man in
Scotland if we're to win this war.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.855
I'll not reave another clan's men.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.557
And I'll not force
a man to risk dying

32:24.651 --> 32:26.141
for something he doesna believe in.

32:26.236 --> 32:27.601
You and I can make them believe.

32:27.696 --> 32:30.779
No, we cannot.

32:34.244 --> 32:38.203
Half of Lovat's men already deserted
at the first opportunity.

32:38.331 --> 32:41.164
A man that fights for his own beliefs

32:41.251 --> 32:45.119
is worth 10 that are forced
to fight for someone else's.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.419
What fine words.

32:47.299 --> 32:50.212
You know, all I hear is talk

32:50.635 --> 32:52.797
and talk and more talk

32:52.888 --> 32:57.098
about fighting and war
and being a soldier,

32:57.184 --> 32:58.595
but I don't see any action.

32:59.436 --> 33:00.642
It's because
they're not ready for action.

33:00.729 --> 33:01.844
They need more training.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.770
And a brawjob of ye're
doing of that, eh?

33:03.857 --> 33:06.064
I just led 10 armed men
into yer camp.

33:06.568 --> 33:09.686
True. Ye did.

33:09.779 --> 33:10.985
And it will no happen again.

33:11.114 --> 33:13.276
- And what's to prevent it?
- You are.

33:13.366 --> 33:15.357
You and your men are now
in charge of sentry duty

33:15.452 --> 33:17.568
for the entire encampment.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.573
And that is an order.

33:25.045 --> 33:26.206
Done.

33:27.255 --> 33:28.745
Get in there!

33:28.840 --> 33:30.956
Go on, then! Get in there!

33:37.390 --> 33:39.222
You put the entire encampment
in jeopardy.

33:39.309 --> 33:40.845
But we need more men.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.268
And you'll be punished
for your carelessness in the morning.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.893
Until then, ye're relieved
of your duty and under arrest.

33:46.983 --> 33:49.691
Post a guard over them for the night.

34:01.081 --> 34:03.243
We canna abide carelessness.

34:05.669 --> 34:10.129
Ross and Kincaid were
neglect in their duties,

34:10.215 --> 34:13.333
allowing 10 strangers
into the camp last night.

34:13.885 --> 34:17.844
For that,
they'll receive six lashes apiece.

34:19.431 --> 34:20.717
Murtagh.

34:56.678 --> 34:58.760
Place the rod back in the pipe.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.429
Good, wide stance.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.506
In the crick of your shoulder.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.843
That's it. That's good.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.639
Wait for my command!

35:11.067 --> 35:12.933
Make sure you check your range.

35:13.028 --> 35:14.234
Take a deep breath.

35:14.321 --> 35:15.982
- You'll be a killing wall.
- Relax.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.358
Again!

35:17.449 --> 35:18.564
- One!
- Fire!

35:28.126 --> 35:29.366
Reload!

35:38.970 --> 35:40.631
Appreciate you letting us
hitch a ride, ma'am.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.013
I just hope you find
the rest of your unit.

35:44.684 --> 35:49.645
The food at our field hospital makes
that chow hall look like a banquet.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.785
Lord! Help me!

36:09.417 --> 36:10.452
Please!

36:11.419 --> 36:12.784
Corporal?

36:15.382 --> 36:16.838
Help me!

36:17.550 --> 36:19.587
- Where's Private Lucas?
- Help me!

36:20.095 --> 36:22.006
Other side of the road somewhere.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.270
We just can't leave him there.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.517
I know.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.689
But they'll see us as soon
as we try to cross the road.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.026
I'll go. I'm a woman.
They want be able to stop me.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.228
You won't get five yards.

36:43.118 --> 36:45.359
God! Help me!

37:03.179 --> 37:05.671
I can see the Krauts on the left.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.221
I'll try to circle
around to the right,

37:07.308 --> 37:09.345
see if I can find a way across.

37:09.436 --> 37:11.677
Stay put. I'll be back for you.

37:11.813 --> 37:12.974
Okay.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.996
Please.

37:39.841 --> 37:42.833
Please.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.088
Mama.

37:44.179 --> 37:45.886
- Shut up.
- Mama.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.386
Ma'am, ma'am, are you okay?

37:51.895 --> 37:53.260
Can you hear me?

37:53.354 --> 37:54.469
Ma'am.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.684
Come on.

38:04.324 --> 38:06.486
What the hell are you doing
down here all alone?

38:07.118 --> 38:08.608
Are you okay?

38:08.912 --> 38:12.701
<i>Please, Mama!</i>

38:12.832 --> 38:14.038
Ma'am.

38:14.626 --> 38:15.661
Laying down?

38:17.128 --> 38:18.368
Claire.

38:40.235 --> 38:42.351
There's nothing you could have done.

38:42.445 --> 38:45.312
I should have tried to get him.

38:45.406 --> 38:50.242
If you had, you would be dead,
just like the soldier, the corporal.

38:52.914 --> 38:54.450
I know that.

38:55.458 --> 38:59.918
Because I told myself the
same thing right after it happened.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.412
And I just

39:03.633 --> 39:06.421
closed the door on that night,

39:06.511 --> 39:07.922
walked away.

39:10.306 --> 39:13.515
And I haven't looked back ever since,
until now.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.934
Now I look at Ross and Kincaid

39:20.024 --> 39:23.187
and all the others
being turned into soldiers,

39:23.278 --> 39:26.145
being trained,
putting up a brave front.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.861
All I can hear is Max Lucas

39:32.704 --> 39:35.366
crying out for his mother
in the dead of night.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.994
For two years

39:40.461 --> 39:43.203
I've tried to stop this war
from coming.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.047
Now that it's here,

39:46.968 --> 39:49.881
I'm not sure
I'm ready to go to war again.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.554
You don't have to.

39:53.641 --> 39:55.473
You fought your war.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.969
We'll fight this one without you.

39:59.230 --> 40:02.393
I'll have Ross and Fergus
take you home to Lallybroch.

40:02.525 --> 40:04.357
- No.
- Claire.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.476
I can't do that either.

40:06.988 --> 40:08.729
Listen to me. If l...

40:08.865 --> 40:10.526
If I go back,

40:11.409 --> 40:14.993
then it will just be like
lying in that ditch again,

40:15.079 --> 40:20.074
helpless and powerless to move,
like a dragonfly in amber,

40:21.586 --> 40:24.169
except this time it will be worse,

40:25.340 --> 40:27.832
because I'll know
that the people out there

40:27.926 --> 40:30.088
dying alone are people I know.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.921
People I love.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.758
I can't do that, Jamie.

40:38.561 --> 40:40.518
I won't lie in that ditch again.

40:41.064 --> 40:46.104
I can't be helpless
and alone ever again.

40:48.196 --> 40:49.277
Do you hear me?

40:49.614 --> 40:51.070
Ihearyou.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.108
I promise,

40:55.703 --> 40:58.946
whatever happens,
you'll never be alone again.

41:03.711 --> 41:06.294
I'm going to hold you
to that, James Fraser.

41:06.756 --> 41:10.545
You have my word, Claire Fraser.

41:47.422 --> 41:48.583
He's just a bairn.

41:48.673 --> 41:49.754
I'm 16!

41:49.841 --> 41:52.754
Sixteen or 60,
he just made a very credible attempt

41:52.844 --> 41:54.255
at cutting my throat.

41:56.139 --> 41:57.174
Who are ye, laddie?

41:59.517 --> 42:02.259
And why are ye
creeping around at night?

42:05.773 --> 42:08.105
Addressed to a British officer.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.024
- He's a SPY-
- I'm no SPY!

42:10.111 --> 42:12.853
I saw the light of your fires,
and when I came to investigate,

42:13.197 --> 42:15.689
I recognised you as Red Jamie,

42:16.200 --> 42:18.692
the unprincipled
and traitorous rebel.

42:19.203 --> 42:23.117
Not a spy,
but conveying with a British officer.

42:26.878 --> 42:28.789
Who do you march with?

42:36.387 --> 42:38.549
Is your arm broken?

42:39.057 --> 42:40.718
I thought I heard something snap.

42:45.813 --> 42:47.554
I'm quite prepared to die.

42:49.567 --> 42:50.682
Is that so?

42:51.235 --> 42:52.475
Well,

42:54.238 --> 42:56.229
I'm afraid
I'm not prepared to kill ye.

42:57.075 --> 42:58.406
<i>Just yet.</i>

43:07.376 --> 43:08.741
Who do ye march with?

43:11.089 --> 43:13.046
I want their number.

43:18.888 --> 43:21.095
And direction of travel.

43:21.516 --> 43:24.599
There's nothing you can do
that will make me talk.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.525
Scottish barbarian.

43:38.616 --> 43:41.233
Leave him alone, you... You sadist.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.445
I resisted your advances earlier,

43:45.790 --> 43:47.622
but if you let the boy go free,

43:47.750 --> 43:51.709
then I will surrender
myself to you, you pig.

43:52.421 --> 43:53.536
Pig?

43:55.883 --> 43:59.797
You may be indifferent
to your own welfare,

44:00.888 --> 44:04.131
but perhaps ye have some concern
for this English lady's honour.

44:04.267 --> 44:05.473
Let her go!

44:06.811 --> 44:08.142
I could, or,

44:09.230 --> 44:11.312
I could ravish her, huh?

44:11.941 --> 44:14.433
Right before yer eyes, huh?

44:16.112 --> 44:17.443
And then,

44:18.614 --> 44:23.654
then give her to my men
to do with what they will, huh?

44:27.665 --> 44:28.996
Sassenach.

44:34.755 --> 44:35.916
All right!

44:36.007 --> 44:39.250
Release the lady, and I will tell you
whatever you wish.

44:39.343 --> 44:40.504
Good.

44:41.012 --> 44:42.093
Hold her.

44:49.478 --> 44:51.264
Until the boy answers my questions.

44:56.027 --> 44:58.018
My name is William Grey,

44:58.487 --> 45:01.354
second son of Viscount Melton.

45:01.490 --> 45:03.026
And what of the troops you're with?

45:04.702 --> 45:06.033
Two hundred infantry,

45:06.120 --> 45:08.532
travelling to Dunbar
to join General Cape's army.

45:09.540 --> 45:12.874
And I'll warn you,
we have heavy armament.

45:13.377 --> 45:17.211
Sixteen carriage-mounted cannon,
mortars and muskets,

45:17.298 --> 45:19.790
and a company of 30 cavalry.

45:19.884 --> 45:22.216
Much obliged for the warning.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.802
And where are these men
ye speak of, presently?

45:29.477 --> 45:31.718
Encamped some three miles
to the west.

45:35.816 --> 45:38.478
Take this man in the direction
he says the camp lies.

45:40.071 --> 45:42.563
If the information he gave us
proves true,

45:42.698 --> 45:45.690
tie him to a tree
one mile from the camp.

45:47.328 --> 45:50.571
His friends
will find him there tomorrow.

45:54.418 --> 45:57.752
If what he told us is not true,

45:59.882 --> 46:01.589
then cut his throat.

46:02.260 --> 46:03.546
Gladly.

46:04.595 --> 46:05.756
I give you your life.

46:08.933 --> 46:10.924
I hope you use it well.

46:14.397 --> 46:15.853
I owe you my life.

46:16.607 --> 46:18.223
I should greatly prefer not to,

46:18.734 --> 46:20.190
but since you have forced
the gift upon me,

46:20.278 --> 46:21.768
I must regard it as a debt of honour.

46:22.446 --> 46:25.279
I should hope to discharge
that debt in the future,

46:25.366 --> 46:26.731
and once it is discharged,

46:27.785 --> 46:29.446
I will kill you.

46:30.579 --> 46:32.866
Then I must hope, sir,

46:32.957 --> 46:35.119
that we do not meet again.

46:35.293 --> 46:38.126
A Grey does not forget
an obligation, sir.

46:38.212 --> 46:39.373
Move.

46:43.801 --> 46:45.542
Who was on watch?

46:47.763 --> 46:48.969
My men.

46:52.560 --> 46:55.143
Canna let the guilty go unpunished.

46:55.396 --> 46:57.808
Dougal's men let the boy
get through the lines.

47:00.318 --> 47:02.776
We canna continue
with this carelessness.

47:08.451 --> 47:09.941
Not from anyone.

47:14.999 --> 47:16.660
That includes me.

47:26.677 --> 47:27.838
What are ye doing, lad?

47:33.142 --> 47:37.761
It was our unshielded fires
that drew the lad to us.

47:37.855 --> 47:39.095
Jamie.

47:46.781 --> 47:49.364
Murtagh, if you'll oblige me.

47:56.791 --> 48:00.375
Six lashes for our unshielded fires.

48:01.670 --> 48:04.879
A dozen more for my carelessness.

48:05.466 --> 48:08.879
After that, we'll take care
of those British troops

48:09.011 --> 48:12.345
Master Grey
so kindly warned us about.

48:51.178 --> 48:54.512
So, what are ye plannin'?

48:54.598 --> 48:57.260
We're to slip into the British camp,

48:58.185 --> 48:59.596
see what trouble we can make.

49:00.104 --> 49:01.344
A braw idea.

49:03.899 --> 49:05.185
Not you.

49:05.276 --> 49:06.607
You'll remain here.

49:06.735 --> 49:08.191
Sentry duty.

49:09.447 --> 49:11.108
We still have a camp to protect.

49:15.619 --> 49:18.862
I stay behind, like some wretched...

49:18.956 --> 49:20.788
Like some wretched soldier

49:21.709 --> 49:23.791
who's been given an order
by his commander.

49:24.628 --> 49:25.789
Aye.

49:28.048 --> 49:29.709
That's exactly what you'll do.

49:35.806 --> 49:36.967
Aye.

49:39.101 --> 49:41.138
Then that's what I'll do.

49:45.316 --> 49:46.977
Good luck to ye.

50:32.029 --> 50:33.269
Awake, are ye?

50:34.323 --> 50:35.654
I am now.

50:35.950 --> 50:37.156
How's your back?

50:38.160 --> 50:39.696
Nae bother.

50:43.332 --> 50:44.618
What are these?

50:46.043 --> 50:47.954
Trophies of war.

50:48.045 --> 50:49.535
Christ, Jamie.

50:51.549 --> 50:52.664
I didna have time to wash.

50:56.804 --> 50:58.636
Where have you been?

50:59.223 --> 51:00.634
Commando raid.

51:04.478 --> 51:06.890
Commando? Is that the right word?

51:07.982 --> 51:09.063
Yes.

51:11.193 --> 51:13.525
- You went to the British camp.
- Aye.

51:13.904 --> 51:15.394
Did you go by yourself?

51:15.489 --> 51:16.479
No.

51:16.574 --> 51:19.066
I couldn't leave my men
out of all the fun, could I?

51:20.160 --> 51:22.492
We had a very profitable night.

51:22.580 --> 51:25.413
Cotter pins from the cannon carriages.

51:25.541 --> 51:29.034
We couldn't take the cannon,
but they'll no go far with no wheels.

51:30.087 --> 51:33.421
Couldn't they fashion another
cotter pin from something else?

51:33.507 --> 51:34.997
Aye, they could.

51:35.092 --> 51:36.503
But the hell a lot of good
it'll do them

51:36.594 --> 51:38.210
if they canna find
wheels to put them in.

51:43.559 --> 51:48.053
Our success tonight was because
of your selflessness, Claire.

51:49.607 --> 51:54.101
It led the lad to confess his
camp's location. It'll save lives.

51:54.570 --> 51:58.939
Because a hell of a lot of good
16 gallopers will do General Cope

51:59.033 --> 52:00.523
stuck out in the woods.

52:09.460 --> 52:11.451
You should get dressed.

52:12.254 --> 52:14.791
That's not
what I expected you to say.

52:18.385 --> 52:22.470
As much as I want you, Sassenach,
we best be off.

52:22.598 --> 52:25.465
The British camp will be waking soon.

53:18.654 --> 53:19.860
Dougal MacKenzie.

53:26.453 --> 53:27.659
Do the honour.

53:28.497 --> 53:29.532
Ride ahead,

53:30.541 --> 53:32.532
and announce our presence
to His Royal Highness,

53:33.377 --> 53:35.038
Prince Charles Edward Stuart.

53:36.004 --> 53:37.369
As ye Say-

53:45.681 --> 53:47.797
No turning back now, Sassenach.

53:47.891 --> 53:49.473
I would say not.

53:50.227 --> 53:51.388
<i>Je suis prest.</i>
