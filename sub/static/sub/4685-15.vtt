I guess you can.

- Oh, my gosh, your
- advice changed my life.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.445
I put my foot down

09:08.446 --> 09:10.092
and Luke actually

09:06.797 --> 09:10.092
listened to me.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.512
Finally! I knew

09:12.513 --> 09:14.805
there was a pit bull beneath

09:10.217 --> 09:14.805
that cutesy poodle exterior!

09:17.557 --> 09:19.577
- And the park - is a great reward
- For good behavior.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.520
- Calvin loves it.
- You want to meet him?

09:21.645 --> 09:23.525
- I gotta warn you, though.
- He's a big licker.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.941
How nice for you?

09:27.359 --> 09:28.944
Hey. You call Luke.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.229
- While we chat, - they can sniff
- Each other's butts.

Calvin's a dog?

09:51.342 --> 09:53.093
I thought you were

09:49.589 --> 09:53.093
a nanny.

09:53.218 --> 09:56.347
I am. A dog nanny.

09:56.472 --> 09:57.865
- A dog nanny?
- Is that even a thing?

09:57.889 --> 09:59.725
This is New York.

10:06.504 --> 10:08.359
is on that pizza?

- (CHUCKLES)
- Luke's a kid?

10:10.569 --> 10:12.237
- From the way
- you talked about him,

10:12.363 --> 10:14.643
- I could have sworn - he was a hyperactive
- Labradoodle.

10:16.534 --> 10:17.885
- Jessie! Can I have
- some kettle corn?

10:17.909 --> 10:19.453
- No, Luke!
- No more treats!

- Please! Please!

10:19.578 --> 10:20.578

10:38.244 --> 10:39.264
Bertram's still in bed.

10:39.390 --> 10:40.475
I'm surprised he

10:40.476 --> 10:41.559
could find his bed.

We left a mess?

17:50.634 --> 17:52.405
your giant lint boulder!

17:53.824 --> 17:55.534
Oh, come on,

17:55.535 --> 17:57.243
it can't be that heavy!

17:57.368 --> 17:58.975
On the contrary, sister,

17:58.976 --> 18:00.580
it is quite dense.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.562
It appears to

18:02.563 --> 18:04.417
have a solid core

18:00.705 --> 18:04.417
of petrified socks.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.232
I'll go get Jessie.

18:06.233 --> 18:07.921
She's great in a crisis.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.861
JESSIE:

18:09.862 --> 18:11.675
Down, Luke! Down, boy!

18:08.046 --> 18:11.675
Somebody help me!

18:14.761 --> 18:17.306
Please get me out!

18:17.307 --> 18:19.850
The junk is closing in!

18:19.975 --> 18:21.289
Don't worry.

18:21.290 --> 18:22.602
Help is on the way!

18:23.269 --> 18:24.521
He's doomed.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.274
Hello, outside world.

18:28.399 --> 18:30.902
I have decided

18:30.903 --> 18:33.404
to make this video

18:28.399 --> 18:33.404
in case the lint wins.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.262
I can already feel

18:36.263 --> 18:37.742
the air getting thicker.

18:37.868 --> 18:38.994
I am almost

18:38.995 --> 18:40.119
out of oxygen.

18:40.578 --> 18:44.499
(COUGHING)

18:44.624 --> 18:46.919
No. It is just

18:46.920 --> 18:49.212
the suffocating stench

18:44.624 --> 18:49.212
of Bertram's socks.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.381
Hey, you broke

18:51.382 --> 18:52.423
into my room!

18:54.009 --> 18:55.635
Quiet!

18:55.636 --> 18:57.261
I am shooting here!

18:59.723 --> 19:01.245
Zuri, if you ever

19:01.246 --> 19:02.767
find this tape,

19:02.893 --> 19:04.686
I want you to know

19:04.687 --> 19:06.479
you have been

19:02.893 --> 19:06.479
a wonderful little sister.

19:06.604 --> 19:09.399
And I also want you to know

19:09.524 --> 19:10.964
it was I who scratched

19:10.965 --> 19:12.402
your Dolly Parton CD.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.153
I knew it!

19:16.073 --> 19:18.179
And I-ee-I

19:18.180 --> 19:20.284
will always love you.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.122
Good, you're here.

19:24.247 --> 19:26.145
You have to save Ravi

19:26.146 --> 19:28.043
so I can pound him.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.441
Ravi, are you okay?

19:30.442 --> 19:32.255
Can you hear me?

19:32.380 --> 19:34.716
RAVI: Yes, but I am starving.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.467
- Oh, look,
- a cheese puff.

19:36.593 --> 19:39.262
ALL: Don't eat anything!

19:39.763 --> 19:42.453
RAVI: Not a cheese puff!

19:42.454 --> 19:45.143
It was not a cheese puff!

19:46.561 --> 19:49.522
Get me out of here!

19:49.647 --> 19:50.774
Oh, great.

19:50.775 --> 19:51.900
Now I have to tell

19:49.647 --> 19:51.900
Morgan and Christina

19:52.025 --> 19:53.214
I turned Luke into

19:53.215 --> 19:54.402
a rabid Rottweiler,

19:54.527 --> 19:56.589
- and got Ravi buried under
- a giant landslide of junk!

19:56.613 --> 19:58.156
On the bright side,

19:58.157 --> 19:59.699
you talked me out

19:56.613 --> 19:59.699
of that perm.

19:59.824 --> 20:00.972
Now that would have

20:00.973 --> 20:02.119
been a disaster.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.622
(BARKING)

20:05.747 --> 20:06.853
Muzzle it, Fido.

20:06.854 --> 20:07.958
I know you're mad at me,

20:08.083 --> 20:09.209
but we've got

20:09.210 --> 20:10.334
a kid stuck under

20:08.083 --> 20:10.334
a giant ball of lint!

20:11.461 --> 20:12.712
(BARKS)

20:12.837 --> 20:14.607
- What's that, boy?
- You think you can find Ravi?

20:14.631 --> 20:16.507
(BARKING)

20:16.633 --> 20:18.551
- And you think you can
- fit through that hole?

20:18.676 --> 20:19.928
(BARKING)

20:20.053 --> 20:21.763
Awesome! Go get him!

20:24.766 --> 20:26.309
- I didn't know
- you spoke canine.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.019
I've been practicing

20:28.020 --> 20:29.604
in case I get a puppy

20:26.434 --> 20:29.604
for Christmas.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.272
Hint, hint.

20:34.525 --> 20:36.569
(GASPS) Yes!

20:36.694 --> 20:37.905
Good boy, Luke!

20:37.906 --> 20:39.114
Ravi, are you okay?

20:39.656 --> 20:40.907
I'm fine.

20:41.032 --> 20:42.673
- Guys, none of this
- would have happened

20:42.784 --> 20:44.265
If I had just

20:44.266 --> 20:45.745
let you get rid of

20:42.784 --> 20:45.745
all my ridiculous junk.

20:47.622 --> 20:48.832
I'm ready to throw it

20:48.833 --> 20:50.041
all away now.

20:50.167 --> 20:51.397
Even the Russian

20:51.398 --> 20:52.627
nesting dolls?

20:52.752 --> 20:53.796
My little babushkas?

20:53.797 --> 20:54.838
Have you no soul?

20:55.713 --> 20:58.049
Luke, look,

20:58.050 --> 21:00.384
I'm really sorry

20:55.713 --> 21:00.384
I treated you like a dog.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.012
But I'm responsible for you

21:02.013 --> 21:03.513
and I couldn't get you

21:00.510 --> 21:03.513
to listen any other way.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.098
Without discipline,

21:03.638 --> 21:06.557
out of control, like...

21:06.683 --> 21:09.019
Hey!

21:09.144 --> 21:10.708
Okay, Jessie,

21:10.709 --> 21:12.271
from now on, I promise

21:09.144 --> 21:12.271
to clean up my act.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.957
- I don't want to
- end up like Bertram.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.483
I'm right here!

21:19.070 --> 21:20.530
Ta-da!

21:20.655 --> 21:22.136
From garbage pile

21:22.137 --> 21:23.616
to living in style!

21:23.741 --> 21:24.993
Wow.

21:24.994 --> 21:26.244
This is amazing.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.643
And look!

21:28.644 --> 21:30.498
I do have a window.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.918
Oh! Thanks, guys.

21:34.044 --> 21:35.358
Look, Bertram,

21:35.359 --> 21:36.671
we mounted your

21:34.044 --> 21:36.671
feather duster collection!

21:36.796 --> 21:39.611
My precision grip

21:39.612 --> 21:42.426
Hawk Tail 3000!

21:36.796 --> 21:42.426
It never looked so good!

21:43.553 --> 21:45.471
So, Bertram,

21:45.596 --> 21:47.077
- do you agree to
- stop hoarding junk

21:47.182 --> 21:48.350
And to get

21:48.351 --> 21:49.517
rid of everything

21:47.182 --> 21:49.517
you don't really need?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.478
Absolutely.

21:51.479 --> 21:53.312
Believe me,

21:49.642 --> 21:53.312
I've learned my lesson.

21:53.437 --> 21:54.814
I'm a changed man.

You kept your eyeballs?

22:03.887 --> 22:05.116
For shame!

22:06.701 --> 22:08.828
They were my mother's!

22:10.163 --> 22:11.289
I wouldn't.

22:11.414 --> 22:12.874
Back away from the eyeballs.
