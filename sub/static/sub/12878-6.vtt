WEBVTT

00:02.560 --> 00:04.289
[blues music plays]

00:11.360 --> 00:13.567
Well, you know, the Bronx is happening.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.642
Yeah, we got, uh-- we got condos,

00:16.000 --> 00:17.923
an outlet mall, a Whole Foods--

00:18.160 --> 00:21.130
everything except, uh,
a high-end restaurant.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.921
Yeah, there's, uh--
there's a lot of opportunity here.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.883
Uh, we-- we like to think
of the Bronx as, uh,

00:26.960 --> 00:29.281
as the Wild West, you know,
and we're the '49ers.

00:29.360 --> 00:32.842
Relax, Jets and Giants fans,
I'm not talking football here.

00:32.920 --> 00:35.526
I'm-- I'm talking about
the original '49ers.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.329
Believe me. There's, uh-- there's gold

00:37.400 --> 00:38.845
to be found amongst the rubble.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.563
And when did you first have
the idea for "Theer-io"?

00:42.920 --> 00:44.445
It's, uh, Thirio.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.841
And, uh, it's a dream we've--
we've had for years.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.088
Yeah, yeah, it was actually,
uh, Tommy's, uh--

00:49.160 --> 00:50.764
Tommy's late wife, Rie.

00:51.040 --> 00:54.169
Uh, you know, she believed that, uh,
we could keep it local

00:54.280 --> 00:55.770
and we could do it here
in the Bronx.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.730
Well, whether Thirio catches on or not,

00:58.800 --> 00:59.801
give these two credit.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.928
Opening a high-end restaurant
in the Bronx

01:02.200 --> 01:04.566
takes good, old-fashioned New York moxie.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.325
For Channel 12 News, I'm Mary Sue White.

01:08.720 --> 01:09.721
Great. Thanks, guys. Good job.

01:09.840 --> 01:10.887
We're good!

01:11.480 --> 01:14.245
- Great job, guys.
- Yeah? We-- we did okay?

01:14.320 --> 01:16.527
Oh, yeah [chuckling] you're a natural.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.443
Listen, if you have any photos

01:18.520 --> 01:20.124
of the restaurant as it was
coming together,

01:20.200 --> 01:22.407
e-mail them over;
it'll help fill out the segment.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.527
Okay.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.081
Hey, I need to talk business.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.603
Yeah, yeah, sure. Later on, yeah?

01:31.520 --> 01:33.124
Hey, dude, dude, are you all right?

01:33.200 --> 01:35.567
- I'm fine.
- T., T.!

01:38.240 --> 01:41.562
Look, I know what this is, huh?
It's just butterflies.

01:41.720 --> 01:43.449
Look, it's just a soft opening, man.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.010
Dress rehearsal. Friends and family.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.043
And my father,
who is neither friend nor family.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.168
Don't-- don't sweat your dad.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.890
Look, we already got him to invest.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.200

01:53.280 --> 01:54.884

this weekend.

01:54.960 --> 01:58.123
- [sighs]
- [stammers] but tonight, It's just--

01:58.240 --> 02:00.163
- it's just a dinner party.
- We didn't budget a hostess.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.810
Dude, dude, will you relax?

02:02.120 --> 02:03.804
Look, I'll take care of the hostess.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.726
All you got to do,
is e-mail the producer the photos

02:06.800 --> 02:08.006
and pick out a nice shirt,

02:08.600 --> 02:10.250
preferably from the men's rack.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.561
You don't like my blouse?

- Hmm?

02:25.720 --> 02:27.245
All right, and tonight--

02:27.320 --> 02:29.163
tonight's all about having fun, baby!

02:43.760 --> 02:47.207
Okay, we have $15,000
of cash disbursements unaccounted for.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.244
I thought you might know
where that went,

02:49.320 --> 02:51.209
since most of the money went through you.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.084
No. No, no idea.
Let me take a look at that.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.162
I checked, and-- and re-checked,
and still...

02:57.280 --> 02:59.442
Wait, wait, wait.
What perfume is that?

03:00.880 --> 03:03.486
Lavender essence. Is it too much?

03:03.920 --> 03:05.490
Oh, God, no, no.

03:05.640 --> 03:06.721
No, it's perfect.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.485
Hey, you know what?

03:11.360 --> 03:13.488
Would you mind stepping in
as hostess tonight?

03:14.280 --> 03:16.567
Yeah, no, look, sorry, look,
I know it's a lot to ask.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.961
You've already done so much, but
,welcoming-—

03:19.720 --> 03:21.324
we really want the first face
people see

03:21.400 --> 03:23.209

um...

03:23.400 --> 03:26.324

03:27.680 --> 03:29.205
And, well, you're beautiful.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.571
Uh, sure. Yeah.

03:33.800 --> 03:34.801
I can do that.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.564
That would be great. You'd be amazing.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.048
Wait, I still need to know
where the money went.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.367
The wine. Yeah, of course.
It all went to the wine.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.767
Uh, the receipts?
Look, we are eight hours away.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.808

04:41.160 --> 04:42.605
Uh, when I worked at Octavio's,

04:42.680 --> 04:44.682
we used to order from, uh, a place

04:44.760 --> 04:47.684

Try that.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.720
I'm an idiot. [sighs]

05:28.920 --> 05:31.446
Look, I'm not really a family man,

05:32.200 --> 05:34.248
so when you lost your parents,

05:34.320 --> 05:35.890
I thought you were going to be a burden,
you know,

05:35.960 --> 05:37.121
to watch over you, but...

05:40.360 --> 05:42.840
you're the closest to a son I'll ever get.

05:45.360 --> 05:48.284
And so, as sort of a father,
I would say...

05:50.240 --> 05:51.810
it's not the worst, you know...

05:53.480 --> 05:54.561
to be a dad.

You think he'd...?

12:06.560 --> 12:07.641
[an] Yes.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.768
Maybe show a little more cleavage.

12:20.760 --> 12:25.084
If this meal
is your version of an apology,

12:25.960 --> 12:27.121
it doesn't suffice.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.600
Apology?

12:30.400 --> 12:32.767
That is not going to happen.

12:35.520 --> 12:38.251
[guns cock]

12:52.080 --> 12:55.402
We have both endured attacks.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.522
Do I have to remind you who first?

12:58.160 --> 13:00.003
Your father's still alive.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.684
Not so for my nephew.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.368
If this continues, we will have war.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.124
[woman] Neither of us wants that.

13:10.640 --> 13:14.326
So, you will give us back our cocaine.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.001
What cocaine?

13:21.640 --> 13:25.087
Your father would have known better.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.085
You know, a country's cuisine
says a lot about its people.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.365
Chinese food, for instance:

13:34.440 --> 13:36.124
greasy, fatty, fried.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.204
Drowned in cloying sauces,
trying to hide the fact;

13:41.000 --> 13:42.490
it's just dog meat.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.124
Instead of asking me for cocaine,

13:48.240 --> 13:49.241
which I don't have,

13:49.960 --> 13:51.928
you should be thinking of ways
to make me forgive you

13:52.000 --> 13:53.445
for ordering a hit on my father.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.529
Start by relocating to Jersey,

13:56.920 --> 13:59.048
and get the hell out of the Bronx.

14:02.560 --> 14:03.891
Move all the product.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.411
I thought you had a gas leak.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.250
I may have been unclear on the phone.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.810
Who cares if there's a leak or not?

14:10.880 --> 14:12.530
We're very sorry about that, okay,

14:12.600 --> 14:14.489
but we're opening a restaurant tonight.

14:14.680 --> 14:18.241
Is there anything you can do to please,
turn the gas back on?

14:18.320 --> 14:19.765
Okay, this-- this is an emergency.

14:19.840 --> 14:23.367
No, actually, it's not.
And meanwhile, I've been pulled away

14:23.440 --> 14:24.601
from potential real emergencies.

14:24.680 --> 14:25.886
Listen, buddy [scoffs]

14:26.240 --> 14:27.730
How quickly can it be done if we,

14:28.000 --> 14:29.490
uh, you know, pay a little extra?

14:29.720 --> 14:30.767
Extra?

14:31.240 --> 14:32.765
Yeah, I always like my chocolate mousse

14:32.880 --> 14:35.360
with a raspberry coulis
and a dollop of whipped cream,

14:35.640 --> 14:36.801
you know what I'm saying?

14:37.760 --> 14:39.046
That chef-speak for a bribe?

14:39.960 --> 14:41.883
Think of it as an incentive

14:42.040 --> 14:44.725
to help a business in the Bronx, hmm?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.689
This is what's wrong with this city;

14:47.160 --> 14:48.286
Culture of deceit.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.086
Oh, my God, just-- just turn on
the damn gas, would you?!

14:51.240 --> 14:53.607
Dion, Dion, okay, just tell us,
how soon can we get it fixed?

14:53.680 --> 14:55.728
The technician will be out tomorrow

14:56.040 --> 14:58.168
sometime between 8:00 and 8:00.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.287
[scoffs]

14:59.520 --> 15:01.761
There's your dollop
of whipped cream, buddy.

15:01.920 --> 15:02.967
- Yeah, very funny.
- Come on, Terry.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.042
- Very funny. Unreal!
- Come on.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.601
Yeah, the one honest guy
in the Bronx! Geez.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.091
See, that's what happens
when you always

15:09.160 --> 15:10.525
think you can bend the rules.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.967
Oh, so now it's my fault
that Pilar can't pay a bill.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.008
No, man, no.
Nothing's ever <i>your</i> fault.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.161
[sighs] T., T., what is wrong
with you today?

15:18.240 --> 15:19.810
Man, you need to get over it.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.167
[blues music plays]

15:25.040 --> 15:26.690
Look, here are your damn receipts.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.842
[mid-tempo music plays]

15:48.080 --> 15:49.241
Now, wait.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.244
You're not gonna blow us up,
are you, Mose?

15:54.240 --> 15:56.004
I'm not sure, man.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.646
[squeaking]

16:17.280 --> 16:18.611

[cheering continues]

16:31.560 --> 16:33.164
[both laugh]

16:33.600 --> 16:37.207
- Whoo!
- Oh! Yes! Yes!

16:38.400 --> 16:40.562
All right, come on.
We got to make up for lost time.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.569
Habib, don't stop.
Come on, keep whisking.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.529
- Got it, Chef.
- Hey, Chef.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.240
I want that lamb more tender
than my heart

16:47.400 --> 16:48.481
when I'm in your arms.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.050
You were never that tender, Chef.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.645
- You know I was. No, seriously,
- [mutters]

16:51.720 --> 16:52.767
You know I was. Val,

16:53.120 --> 16:55.088
Val, thinner, finer.
It's looking good, though.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.247
Yes, Chef.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.163
Let me see that knife.
Come on, let me see it.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.401
All right, you know,
a good knife

17:02.120 --> 17:03.963
can last your whole life.

17:04.680 --> 17:05.806
Your morn taught me that.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.930
You know,
her knives were always immaculate.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.882
Go ahead, try that. Go on.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.401
[Dion] Alright, let's go. Let's go!

17:12.480 --> 17:14.800

till game time, people! Come on!

Um, I got you an opening-night present.

I mean, even though...

18:41.120 --> 18:42.804
opening night is actually tomorrow.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.724
But...here. [chuckles]

18:44.920 --> 18:47.287
What? You didn't have to do that.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.007
Wow.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.768
That's very thoughtful of you, thank you.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.169
I wanted you to know how much
I love working here.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.522
No, I know. It's been-- it's been great.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.689
Uh, let me fix that. [chuckles]

19:07.920 --> 19:09.410
Oh. Thanks.

I'm so excited about tonight.

19:13.880 --> 19:14.927
Yeah.

can we go tomorrow?

No, no, no, that-- that's okay.
That's okay.

[soft guitar music plays]

20:19.000 --> 20:21.002
Uh, Pilar, I was wondering,

20:21.080 --> 20:22.923
I'm happy to work tonight as a waiter,

20:23.240 --> 20:24.526
but do you think at some point,

20:24.600 --> 20:26.807
I can have a job in-- in the kitchen?

20:27.360 --> 20:28.930
Why are you asking me?
I'm not the owner.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.690
- I'm just the manager.
- Yeah, right, right.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.167
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.287
Ah, Ronaldo's Wine Shop.

20:37.520 --> 20:40.251
You know, one of my brothers
from my squad got a job there

20:40.320 --> 20:43.085
when he got back,
before it closed down.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.846
Closed down?

20:45.040 --> 20:46.804
Yeah, last year.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.562
Are you sure we're talking
about the same place?

20:51.640 --> 20:55.486
Yeah. Ronaldo's Wine Shop
over on, uh, 164th.

[speaks Spanish angrily]

21:05.120 --> 21:06.485
[rapid footsteps approach]

21:08.320 --> 21:10.721
These are fake!
You gave me fake receipts?!

21:11.560 --> 21:12.641
What?

21:13.760 --> 21:15.603
Wow, you know,
you-- you look amazing.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.167
You gave me all this crap
about one accounting error,

21:18.280 --> 21:19.281
but this-- this is illegal.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.286
All right, Pilar, listen to me,

21:22.520 --> 21:25.285
all right, opening a restaurant?
It's not easy.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.327
Now, if you don't cut some corners,
you're never gonna make it.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.323
Look, if this fails,
poor Tommy's gonna fall back--

21:30.400 --> 21:32.323
This is not about Tommy!
Don't pretend it's about Tommy!

I've ever worked with.

Yeah, if you're not careful,
I could always--

What, you're gonna run me off
for calling you on your shit?

21:39.600 --> 21:41.682

with us tonight.

23:49.680 --> 23:50.920
Right this way.

- Okay, Val! Quick, quick!
- Coming, Chef!

- You got the lamb.
- Looking good, Chef. Real good.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.602
[Dion] ...that's what I want to hear.
Service!

24:02.920 --> 24:03.967
I'm telling you, Neil,

24:04.520 --> 24:05.851
you should tear down
the whole waterfront,

24:05.920 --> 24:08.241
stack it with luxury high rises.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.765
Not that that's my business.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.649
No, it just generates business for you.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.047
[Aidan chuckles]

24:14.720 --> 24:16.290
Tell me what you think
of the food tonight.

24:16.800 --> 24:19.610
The location works,
but I'm not settled on the chef.

24:22.280 --> 24:25.602
Hey. Why so stingy with the bread?

24:26.200 --> 24:27.486
And, what, no butter?

24:30.360 --> 24:31.486
I'll get your waiter.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.683
You feeling okay, Aidan?

Yeah. I'm fine.

Come on, VIP table.

from Spain.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.246

in front of you.

- What, the old guy?

24:55.360 --> 24:57.488
- No.
- Excuse me.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.084
Enough makeup on those women?

25:00.280 --> 25:02.362
Oh, my gosh, they look like whores.

Dude, don't drown them.
Val, you're looking after my babies.

25:17.520 --> 25:18.806
[Val] Like they were my own, Chef.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.161
Come here, kid.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.647
The image you present
to the world is important,

25:30.720 --> 25:32.131
especially for you.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.001
How's the hand?

25:36.920 --> 25:38.046
Good.

25:39.640 --> 25:40.801
[Dion] Come on, let's go!

25:41.680 --> 25:43.330
Fiasco, beautiful, man.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.085
- Me or the cockles, Chef?
- Don't make me answer that.

25:56.280 --> 25:57.770
I didn't think you were gonna come.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.246
I got hungry-

26:01.640 --> 26:02.721
He)', Mose!

26:03.160 --> 26:05.322
Get this lady a table, huh?

26:05.400 --> 26:06.561
Yeah, Chef.

[mid-tempo Mediterranean music plays]

26:19.880 --> 26:21.006
Thank you.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.367
Hi, there.

26:34.440 --> 26:35.601
[Pilar] How you doing?

26:35.760 --> 26:39.367
I'm... feeling good. Happy.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.603
Hmm. I didn't know you were
coming tonight.

26:43.480 --> 26:45.642
Well, I didn't plan to, but I...

26:46.680 --> 26:49.160
I guess I'm thinking about
letting Dion into my life

26:49.280 --> 26:50.930
a little more than I expected.

27:12.520 --> 27:13.965
Oh, my God, what am I doing?

27:14.800 --> 27:16.484
He would be a terrible father.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.364
[Marisa] He's into drugs. He's into girls.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.841
Is he dating anyone?

27:21.760 --> 27:23.444
I... don't know.

27:23.720 --> 27:25.643
Yeah. Doesn't matter.

27:26.120 --> 27:28.691
But just, since I'm curious,

27:29.640 --> 27:32.769
will you let me know if you...
see him with any other women?

27:33.760 --> 27:34.966
Sure.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.441

All right, whatever.

Look, our targeted clientele
is your dad's table.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.882
Just I-- I can't read him.

28:24.280 --> 28:26.487
- They're all a bunch of poker faces.
- Hmm.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.407
What do you think, huh?

28:28.880 --> 28:29.927
And that guy?

28:30.600 --> 28:32.887
Maybe he just doesn't like lamb, okay?

28:33.480 --> 28:35.448
Don't worry, all right? I think we'll...

28:39.360 --> 28:40.361

Please, please, come over here.

Jesus, now?

29:03.320 --> 29:05.527
I'm in the middle
of running a restaurant here.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.648
Sorry, but, uh, we don't call ahead.

29:08.360 --> 29:09.885
- Well--
- Is that T.J.?

29:10.680 --> 29:11.761
Working?

29:12.280 --> 29:13.520
No, he's not working.

Um, this-- this is a private dinner party,

They're close family friends.

Um, you know,we live
in the apartment upstairs, actually.

29:35.560 --> 29:36.800
[Nancy] Mm, right.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.130
Well, um, I'm going to need to see
that it's a suitable home environment.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.126
As opposed to what?

29:44.560 --> 29:45.800
Let's just see the home.

- I'm Nancy.
- [Tommy] This is T.J.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.330
So, T.J.,
I just want to ask you a few questions.

30:03.520 --> 30:04.931
He-- he doesn't speak.

30:05.080 --> 30:07.970
He hasn't spoken since his mom
died a year ago.

30:08.920 --> 30:11.810
I mean, that-- that's-- that's
why you're here, right?

30:12.080 --> 30:14.367
I mean,
it was obviously very traumatic.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.604
Tommy, what's going on?

30:16.720 --> 30:18.529
I got people waiting
for wine downstairs.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.250
- I'm kind of busy here.
- Yeah, well, so am I.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.322
- Look, is this gonna take long?
- You are...?

full of people.

She's from Child Protective Services.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.285
Well, can you tell her to come back later?

30:29.360 --> 30:31.089
No, I cannot tell her to come back later.

30:31.160 --> 30:32.321
- Would you--
- I'm Dion Patras.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.925
- Tommy's best friend.
- Dion.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.765
Look, I was here when T.J. was born.
I'm telling you, he's a great kid.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.126
He's just going through a rough
patch right now, right, champ?

30:38.200 --> 30:40.248
- Okay, Dion.
- Okay, I'm gonna ask both of you

30:40.320 --> 30:41.367
to wait downstairs.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.601
Absolutely.
Anything we can do to help--

30:42.680 --> 30:44.762
- [Nancy] Please.
- Okay. Come on. Come on.

30:47.520 --> 30:48.726
What are you mad at me for?

30:49.000 --> 30:50.604
Huh?
Look, I'm just telling her.

30:50.720 --> 30:51.881
Your name.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.125
You have a record.

30:54.680 --> 30:55.841
You know that, right?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.843
It's like you forget, don't you?

31:00.400 --> 31:02.607
You do something,
and then, pfft,

31:02.680 --> 31:05.206
it's out of your head forever,
like it never happened.

31:07.880 --> 31:08.927
[sighs]

31:16.000 --> 31:17.047
[Dion softly] Okay-

31:18.480 --> 31:21.006
Hey, Tommy, Tommy,
would you pour some more wine?

31:21.080 --> 31:22.161
You're making me nervous.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.401
What is taking her so long?

31:23.880 --> 31:24.961
[Nancy] Mr. Moran?

31:25.560 --> 31:26.766
Yes?

31:28.360 --> 31:30.488
[Tommy] Hey. Hey. How'd it go?

31:30.960 --> 31:33.930
I, uh, have a couple of questions
for you now.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.441
Of course, yes. Ask away.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.762
- [Aidan] What's going on?
- [Tommy] Nothing.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.211
I'll be right with you.

31:40.480 --> 31:43.802
So, how's T.J. dealing
with all the disruption

31:43.920 --> 31:46.048
of starting a restaurant in his residence?

31:46.320 --> 31:48.561
Oh, uh, it's not been a problem at all.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.250
He's-- He's okay with it.

31:50.480 --> 31:53.404
Okay? He's more than okay.

31:55.320 --> 31:57.322
You're looking at three
generations here.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.444
Ever since T.J.'s mom died,

32:02.000 --> 32:05.083
I've been taking care of my grandson
when Tommy's been busy with work.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.962
You can't find a more supportive family.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.407
Hmm.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.968
Well, I'm gonna let you get back to it.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.810
Great. Thank you.

32:15.160 --> 32:16.525
Um, I'm glad this worked out--

32:16.600 --> 32:18.284
Well, this was just the first visit.

32:18.560 --> 32:21.962
There's gonna be at least one more
unannounced spot check.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.044
Nice meeting you, T.J.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.366
Well done.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.005
I didn't do it for you.

32:34.280 --> 32:35.645
I did it for my investment.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.964

I've had since...

my mother cooked for me.

- Did we rock it or what?
- Whoo!

33:46.280 --> 33:48.760
Yeah, we all got a shaky start.
Come on, but we clicked.

Ah, we caught fire!

No, no, no, I heard it made
three people cry, huh?

- Mm-hmm.
- Tommy,

33:57.040 --> 33:58.201
- Proud of you, man. Proud of you.
I love you.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.089
- ...where is your glass?
- Uh, not drinking.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.728

some more champagne.

- [Val] Yeah, you will.
- Yeah!

our gas whisperer.

34:12.560 --> 34:15.245
- Yes, Mose!
- Moooose!

34:29.520 --> 34:30.806
Hey.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.081
Where are you going?

34:33.639 --> 34:36.210
They're, uh, they're all up on the roof.

34:36.520 --> 34:38.362
You should stay and celebrate.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.969

We got a big day tomorrow.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.764
- I'm beat.
- Well...

Thank you for everything.

It's cool, it's cool.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.768
Don't worry about it. It's well-hidden.

36:51.640 --> 36:54.120
I should hope so. Go get it for me now.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.881
Right. I don't have access to it tonight.

You're friends with Patrick Woichik now?

No.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.927
He just wanted to wish me luck
on our new venture.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.570
Was he being ironic?

37:51.000 --> 37:52.889
I mean, you burned down his restaurant.

37:53.320 --> 37:56.164
I already apologized
about all that when I got out of prison.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.284

I mean, he does seem the forgiving type.

38:04.520 --> 38:07.808
Look,dude,
he-- he said they got the insurance money

38:08.160 --> 38:11.084
and that they were looking to get out
of the restaurant business anyways.

38:12.280 --> 38:14.851

You called it.

tonight.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.720
You know, just, uh-- you know,
just try and enjoy it.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.203
[motorcycle engines buzzing]

38:50.200 --> 38:52.009
[silenced gunshots, glass shatters]

38:52.320 --> 38:54.209
[man] Shit!

39:01.960 --> 39:04.201
[tires screeching]

39:09.440 --> 39:12.410
<i>[White] In what police believe
may be</i> a <i>gang-related shooting</i>

39:12.480 --> 39:14.323
<i>occurring just after 9:00 tonight</i>

39:14.400 --> 39:16.448
<i>at the corner of 170th
and Trinity Avenue...</i>

39:16.520 --> 39:18.124
[Mose] Hey, there's our sign.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.406
<i>...there are two confirmed dead.</i>

39:20.040 --> 39:21.280
<i>It certainly won't help this borough</i>

39:21.360 --> 39:24.523
<i>shake its reputation
for violence and crime. [siren wails]</i>

39:24.600 --> 39:26.921
<i>Some have taken to calling
the Bronx the Wild West.</i>

39:27.000 --> 39:28.445
[phone ringing]
[Man] Thirio.

39:28.520 --> 39:30.887
<i>- But tonight, it truly is.
- [Mose] Ah, yes.</i>

39:30.960 --> 39:32.325
<i>For Channel 12 News, I'm Mary Sue White.</i>

39:32.400 --> 39:35.290
- [Mose] Another time, maybe. Thirio
- [groans]

39:36.480 --> 39:38.084
[Mose] Uh, yes, your party of four.

39:38.760 --> 39:42.446
Okay, um, would you like to
reschedule for another night?

39:42.520 --> 39:44.522
[phone ringing]
[Mose] Hold on one moment, please.

39:44.760 --> 39:47.161
[Mose] Thirio. Okay.
[phone ringing]

39:47.400 --> 39:50.404
[Mose] Um, okay, maybe, uh, another time.

39:51.080 --> 39:52.161
[phone ringing]

39:52.680 --> 39:53.727
[Mose] Thirio.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.081
What are you looking at me like that?
I didn't start the shooting.

39:57.160 --> 39:58.605
No? You had nothing to do with it?
[phone ringing]

39:58.680 --> 39:59.841
[Dion] What, you seriously think
I was invo--

39:59.920 --> 40:01.524
Why was Patrick Woichik here?

40:02.560 --> 40:03.607
[Mose in the distance] Yes, uh, sorry,
hold on one moment.

40:03.680 --> 40:06.001
Can any part of you answer that
without lying?

40:07.120 --> 40:08.167
[phone ringing]

40:08.920 --> 40:10.251
- [scoffs]
- [Mose] Thirio.

40:10.640 --> 40:13.405
You get rid of the coke,
like I told you to?

40:15.400 --> 40:17.607
Can any part of you answer <i>that</i>
without lying?

40:18.800 --> 40:20.404
- All right, look, T.
- Don't.

40:21.760 --> 40:22.966
Don't even start.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.009
There's always something else
going on with you.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.929
Look, where's all this
coming from, huh?

40:28.840 --> 40:30.330
[Mose] Would you like to reschedule?

40:30.920 --> 40:32.922
Look, I know you're worried
about the restaurant, okay?

40:33.000 --> 40:36.129
I get it. I am, too, but, yeah, you know,
all this-- it's...

40:37.840 --> 40:38.887
It's gonna blow over.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.131
We're gonna be okay.
[phone ringing]

40:42.840 --> 40:44.285
I don't know about that.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.728
[Tommy] We had our soft opening
last night.

41:05.320 --> 41:06.481
It was good.

41:07.360 --> 41:08.600
You would have...

41:11.000 --> 41:12.161
People enjoyed it.

41:14.480 --> 41:15.925
[Tommy] It's hard for me, though. I...

41:17.640 --> 41:18.926
It's like I wasn't there.

41:19.640 --> 41:22.120
You know, my-- my palate was off and...

41:28.120 --> 41:29.167
[sighs]

41:29.560 --> 41:31.961
I'm doing the best I can,
but I don't know, Rie.

41:35.080 --> 41:37.401
Of the three most important people
in my life,

41:37.480 --> 41:39.209
two can't talk to me,
and the third,

41:39.280 --> 41:41.726
every time he opens his mouth,
he lies.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.562
[soft guitar music plays]

41:49.520 --> 41:51.363
Maybe it's good you can't talk to me.

41:55.720 --> 41:57.529
'Cause the first thing I'd ask is...

42:02.240 --> 42:04.004
did you sleep with Dion?

42:09.080 --> 42:10.889
[soft guitar music plays]

42:11.305 --> 42:17.476
