00:00.093 --> 00:01.656
<i>Previously on Ravenswood...</i>

00:01.664 --> 00:03.700
I don't think Miranda's
death was an accident.

00:03.701 --> 00:04.924
Of course it was
an accident.

00:04.925 --> 00:07.038
It's a lot bigger than all of us.
It's a pattern.

00:07.039 --> 00:08.646
People say this place
is cursed.

00:08.647 --> 00:10.052
Maybe this is what
they're talking about.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.967
Luke was right.
About what?

00:11.968 --> 00:14.751
Here... Fits you better.

00:15.506 --> 00:18.592
<i>Miranda's still here.
I've talked to her.</i>

00:18.626 --> 00:20.561
You mean her... ghost.

00:20.595 --> 00:23.480
<i>She's stuck here. I just...</i>
<i>Don't know how to help her.</i>

00:23.514 --> 00:24.939
...Are my mother's things.

00:24.940 --> 00:28.060
Part of me's been hoping
she'd show up now that I'm dead.

00:28.076 --> 00:29.436
Who's Abby, mom?

00:29.470 --> 00:32.472
Abby Wheeler was your
dad's girlfriend in high school.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.358
Abby's been dead
for over 20 years.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.443
<i>I saw Abby</i>
<i>at the funeral yesterday.</i>

00:36.477 --> 00:38.680
- We need some answers.
- A sÃ©ance?

00:38.681 --> 00:40.653
I think this girl Abby
really wants to talk to me.

00:40.654 --> 00:42.655
There spirits... I don't think
they wanna help anyone.

00:42.656 --> 00:45.742
- One of them wants to communicate.
- I just have a really bad feeling.

00:45.776 --> 00:48.578
Is my father's killer
trying to kill us?

00:50.881 --> 00:52.499
Guys, look out!!!

00:56.470 --> 00:58.028
Miranda?

01:22.530 --> 01:24.497
Abby,
where did you go?!

01:30.000 --> 01:31.750
Abby, where are you?

01:40.923 --> 01:42.474
No, wait!

01:45.398 --> 01:47.646
ABBY WHEELER, LOVING DAUGHTER
1975 - 1992

02:05.693 --> 02:07.446
<i>Sorry I've been so bad
about returning calls.</i>

02:07.472 --> 02:09.987
<i>Believe me, Hanna, it's not like
I don't want to hear your voice.</i>

02:09.988 --> 02:12.420
<i>There's so much I need to tell
you, not sure where to begin.</i>

02:19.999 --> 02:22.000
I think I saw her...

02:22.052 --> 02:25.971
Abby. And others... More of them.
More of me.

02:26.005 --> 02:27.956
Kids.

02:27.974 --> 02:32.268
When I got closer, they...
They disappeared, but the headstone...

02:32.934 --> 02:35.088
Abby's... it...

02:35.089 --> 02:36.932
It broke in half.

02:38.935 --> 02:40.819
Why are you
looking at me like that?

02:42.155 --> 02:45.074
Hey, are you upset that I left you
while you were sleeping?

02:45.108 --> 02:49.995
No, I'm upset because a driver called out
"Ravenswood" and I got off the bus.

02:51.337 --> 02:53.586
- You still freaked out about the...
- Aren't you?

02:53.621 --> 02:57.573
Yeah. It's why I left.
I heard something outside.

02:57.591 --> 02:59.709
Thought if whatever it was
that cracked the ceiling

02:59.743 --> 03:02.578
could still be out there
and I could find out more...

03:02.596 --> 03:04.457
What's on your arm?

03:04.882 --> 03:08.417
Nothing. I, uh...
I cut myself cleaning up.

03:10.637 --> 03:14.641
Um, we might need to work
out some sort of system...

03:15.097 --> 03:18.962
Uh, just so I can have some warning...
I can put on some underwear.

03:19.563 --> 03:20.780
Right.

03:20.814 --> 03:23.483
Um, can I help?

03:23.534 --> 03:26.363
- Put on underwear?
- Finish cleaning up.

03:26.364 --> 03:28.691
Think you, uh, kinda
lost that skill, didn't you?

03:28.692 --> 03:30.892
Never really had it.

03:33.091 --> 03:36.538
This... the same e-mail you've
been trying to write since Monday?

03:36.615 --> 03:38.332
Sunday.

03:40.029 --> 03:43.081
- May be easier to do over the phone.
- You think?

03:43.133 --> 03:47.587
"Dear Hanna, so much
has happened since we last spoke."

03:47.627 --> 03:49.764
"I nearly drowned in a bathtub
and a sunken car."

03:49.765 --> 03:51.449
"I went to Miranda's funeral."

03:51.450 --> 03:54.535
"I was attacked
by Cujo's cousin in a junkyard."

03:54.536 --> 03:57.589
"The light above my couch
tried to decapitate me tonight."

03:57.735 --> 04:01.328
"And the... oh, did I mention... I was
scheduled to die in that car, too."

04:01.398 --> 04:04.400
You can... leave out
some stuff.

04:05.059 --> 04:08.528
I've never lied to her, Miranda.
All right, maybe once.

04:09.813 --> 04:12.104
But I'm lucky she spoke to me
again after that.

04:12.105 --> 04:14.756
And I <i>don't</i> want
to lose her again.

04:30.667 --> 04:32.468
What are you doin' down here?

04:33.554 --> 04:35.975
Couldn't sleep. You?

04:36.037 --> 04:37.673
Yeah.

04:38.642 --> 04:41.611
Livie...

04:41.645 --> 04:44.397
I'm not gonna say I didn't
see what I saw tonight.

04:45.649 --> 04:47.734
But I never wanna
do that again.

04:48.031 --> 04:50.598
You need to stay away from that place.
Do you understand me?

04:50.613 --> 04:52.279
It wasn't about where we were.

04:52.281 --> 04:54.594
If dad was killed because he
found out something...

04:54.595 --> 04:56.730
- Something about us...
- Stop.

04:56.731 --> 05:00.436
I don't think it's gonna go away if we
don't step on the cracks in the sidewalk.

05:00.437 --> 05:04.374
Fine. But I sure as hell don't want
to make whatever that was angry again.

05:04.375 --> 05:05.575
Okay?

05:07.515 --> 05:09.266
Leave it alone.

05:10.301 --> 05:11.501
Please.

05:46.754 --> 05:49.506
Hey! Remy! It's okay.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.415
It's okay.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.282
It's okay.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.314
Just go upstairs, honey.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.071
I'll get this...

06:20.666 --> 06:24.881
Season 1, Episode 04
"The Devil Has a Face"

06:25.790 --> 06:28.790
Synced by Reef
www.addic7ed.com

06:29.380 --> 06:32.682
- I saw it, myself, this morning.
- You're sure it was Abby's headstone?

06:32.717 --> 06:35.352
I'm positive. And it was <i>not</i>
<i>in a million pieces.</i>

06:35.386 --> 06:38.424
- It was literally sliced in half.
- Did Miranda see this happen?

06:38.425 --> 06:41.341
This isn't the first time some idiot
messed around with a headstone.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.393
Well, unless this "idiot"
is a skilled stonecutter

06:43.394 --> 06:46.279
or carries around a bolt of lightning,
this was done by something else.

06:46.314 --> 06:48.028
She was being punished.

06:48.029 --> 06:49.979
- Who was punished?
- Abby.

06:49.980 --> 06:52.865
For trying to contact us...
For telling us about the pact.

06:52.899 --> 06:54.700
We need to make our
<i>own</i> pact.

06:54.734 --> 06:56.202
What does that mean?

06:56.210 --> 06:58.855
It means we need to stop to stop
looking for answers from the dead.

06:58.856 --> 07:02.273
We need to find somebody in town
who's <i>alive</i> and willing to talk.

07:02.274 --> 07:04.660
How? Why would they?

07:04.711 --> 07:07.796
We barely know anything yet,
and I'm scared to close my eyes.

07:07.831 --> 07:11.194
What if they could do it anonymously?
We could use the <i>Gazette's</i> blog.

07:11.195 --> 07:13.619
My dad said it's my baby.
I can float the questions.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.277
We can see if anyone
would share.

07:16.422 --> 07:18.905
- Where are you going?
- Uh, school.

07:19.085 --> 07:22.833
- We've got plenty of time.
- I can't be late. So...

07:23.222 --> 07:25.479
Uh, Remy, can I speak
to you for a sec?

07:31.821 --> 07:34.657
So, uh, I was thinking...

07:34.691 --> 07:36.775
Maybe... oh, after the library...

07:36.809 --> 07:41.118
Me and you could get something to eat,
catch a movie, maybe, or something.

07:41.141 --> 07:44.376
- Tonight?
- Yeah. Why?

07:44.377 --> 07:46.503
I thought your mom
spoke to your dad about us.

07:46.504 --> 07:49.386
Oh, it has nothing to do with my dad.
It's just I don't think...

07:49.789 --> 07:52.392
I can sit in a dark room
right now.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.961
Well you wouldn't
be doing it alone.

08:00.550 --> 08:01.750
What?

08:02.263 --> 08:05.198
Nothing. My mind is just
crowded, that's all.

08:08.262 --> 08:09.462
Okay.

08:11.811 --> 08:14.730
Is he seriously gonna pretend
he wasn't there last night?

08:14.781 --> 08:16.699
He knows he was there.

08:16.733 --> 08:19.618
He just can't
deal with this yet.

08:19.653 --> 08:21.870
Luke still hasn't wrapped
his head around our father

08:21.905 --> 08:23.822
never walking
through that door again.

08:46.730 --> 08:51.734
- Yo, Luke, you okay?
- Yeah. Uh, just wasn't paying attention.

08:51.768 --> 08:54.903
- Hey, where's your sister?
- She's at the...

08:54.938 --> 08:58.532
- The vault with friends.
- Right. Yeah.

08:58.533 --> 09:00.484
The new crowd. Um...

09:00.549 --> 09:02.947
Yeah. Luke, you sure you're
gonna be all right, man?

09:02.948 --> 09:04.532
All good.

09:14.708 --> 09:18.103
- I don't know if I would use "haunted."
- What would you call it?

09:19.423 --> 09:20.756
"Haunted."

09:20.790 --> 09:23.426
Did you forget you
have a doctor's appointment?

09:23.460 --> 09:26.629
Uh... Dr. Frankel's office
called after you left.

09:26.647 --> 09:28.598
Hey, Ms. Matheson.

09:28.632 --> 09:30.829
You wanna grab your bag,
meet me outside?

09:30.843 --> 09:33.578
Mom... I don't need
to see Dr. Frankel.

09:34.738 --> 09:36.639
You were dragged
from a river last week.

09:36.657 --> 09:39.442
I think keeping a follow-up
appointment would be wise.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.012
Come.

09:43.743 --> 09:45.777
See you later.

09:53.068 --> 09:54.870
Rochelle?

09:56.839 --> 09:58.874
Morning.

09:58.938 --> 10:00.772
Uh, meant to call you.

10:01.550 --> 10:03.417
Why?

10:03.418 --> 10:07.015
You left the funeral so abruptly,
I didn't get a chance to say "thank you."

10:07.082 --> 10:10.724
Sorry, I can't do this right now.
I-I have to get Olivia to the doctor.

10:10.754 --> 10:12.271
Were you hurt last night?

10:13.677 --> 10:15.478
What was last night?

10:16.489 --> 10:17.907
What's he talking about,
Olivia?

10:17.908 --> 10:20.776
I think my new caretaker
hosted some kind of party.

10:21.652 --> 10:24.211
- Must've gotten out of hand.
- I...

10:24.788 --> 10:27.823
Get in the car, would you?
Please?

10:31.437 --> 10:33.271
If there was any kind
of damage, I'm...

10:33.272 --> 10:35.836
- I'll write a check...
- That's not necessary, Shelley.

10:36.294 --> 10:38.903
Well, you said that she might've been
hurt, so something must've happened...

10:38.904 --> 10:41.784
Look, I didn't...
mean to upset you...

10:42.234 --> 10:43.611
Been through enough.

10:43.612 --> 10:46.147
If I'd known the police planned
to corner you after the service,

10:46.148 --> 10:47.852
- I would've stepped in...
- Doesn't matter where I am.

10:47.863 --> 10:49.309
I could be here or there...
The market.

10:49.310 --> 10:50.998
Somebody's probably watching
me right now.

10:50.999 --> 10:55.672
Well... I would never let anyone
insult you in my house.

10:58.975 --> 11:00.809
Thank you, Ray.

11:11.655 --> 11:14.257
I didn't know
you two were friends.

11:15.985 --> 11:19.788
- We went to school together.
- It's not like he ever came to our house.

11:19.822 --> 11:22.958
When your father was alive?
He wouldn't.

11:22.992 --> 11:25.669
- They didn't care for each other.
- Why?

11:25.719 --> 11:29.014
Oh, your dad didn't like the way
Mr. Collins did business.

11:29.048 --> 11:31.766
- There might've been other reasons.
- Like what?

11:31.801 --> 11:34.769
I think I should be the one who's
asking you questions right now.

11:46.447 --> 11:49.782
What's that for?
Uh, the picture?

11:50.308 --> 11:54.463
Sorry, was I supposed to say
"Marco" so you could say "Polo"?

11:54.544 --> 11:57.546
Thought maybe, uh, I'd show
Abby's family this, myself.

11:57.581 --> 12:01.584
Maybe they can talk to me
about the explosion at the school.

12:01.618 --> 12:03.619
Listen, that was dumb...

12:03.637 --> 12:05.788
What I said earlier
about that e-mail to Hanna.

12:05.806 --> 12:07.790
I wasn't trying to say that you
haven't been through a lot...

12:07.808 --> 12:09.230
I know that.

12:09.231 --> 12:10.982
Maybe if you
said something to her...?

12:10.983 --> 12:12.697
If Hanna knows that
I'm in any kind of danger,

12:12.729 --> 12:14.847
she's gonna be here
before you can say "help."

12:15.272 --> 12:17.974
And I'm not gonna put a target
on her back, too.

12:20.737 --> 12:24.445
Is my being here
starting to irritate you?

12:26.576 --> 12:28.137
What is she doing?

12:28.612 --> 12:31.497
Hello. Excuse me.

12:32.532 --> 12:34.733
- Where are you taking those?
- Home.

12:34.751 --> 12:36.485
Um, I don't think
you can do that.

12:36.503 --> 12:38.587
- Why not?
- Well, it's called stealing."

12:38.622 --> 12:40.756
Caleb?

12:40.791 --> 12:44.660
- Do I know you?
- Is your last name Rivers?

12:44.678 --> 12:46.545
Yeah. Why?

12:46.596 --> 12:49.548
My God,
you're the spitting image.

12:49.599 --> 12:53.257
- I'm... not following.
- Henry's oldest brother, Caleb...

12:53.258 --> 12:56.505
Caleb Rivers... you...
You look <i>just like</i> him.

12:56.523 --> 12:58.223
Wait, are you...

12:58.224 --> 13:00.526
Are you talking about the Caleb
that died in the boating accident

13:00.560 --> 13:02.101
like, way back?

13:02.227 --> 13:03.446
You knew him?

13:03.480 --> 13:06.565
Oh, no... Only from the photograph
on Henry's mantle, but...

13:06.650 --> 13:08.651
Your face, it's...

13:08.685 --> 13:11.454
- Remarkable.
- Is Henry here?

13:11.488 --> 13:15.250
Oh, no. He went up
to Cabotsville years ago, but...

13:15.251 --> 13:18.151
I'm sure I would've
heard if Henry had passed.

13:21.465 --> 13:23.499
Don't forget to date
your papers, guys...

13:23.533 --> 13:25.468
Or at least change the date,

13:25.502 --> 13:28.184
if you're recycling something
that you wrote in sixth grade.

13:29.706 --> 13:31.540
You can e-mail it
to me, Luke.

13:34.544 --> 13:37.394
What'd you do to the knee?

13:37.488 --> 13:39.565
Uh, fell off my bike.

13:39.599 --> 13:42.334
Hey, we haven't spoken
since the car accident.

13:42.381 --> 13:44.487
I was sorry to hear about the
girl who didn't make it.

13:44.521 --> 13:46.572
I didn't really know her,
so...

13:46.606 --> 13:48.288
But you do now...

13:48.859 --> 13:51.009
In a way you probably
wish you didn't.

13:51.695 --> 13:53.863
I mean, given what you and
your family have been through,

13:53.897 --> 13:55.443
I'm guessing
that this whole week...

13:55.448 --> 13:58.617
- Has probably brought up other stuff.
- I'll have that paper for you tomorrow.

13:58.668 --> 14:01.620
That might not be enough
to pull your grade back up.

14:01.671 --> 14:03.589
You're way behind.

14:03.623 --> 14:05.424
I get it.
I know why. I just...

14:06.760 --> 14:08.677
I don't want you to have
to take this class again.

14:08.745 --> 14:10.579
Oh, me, neither.

14:10.597 --> 14:12.779
Luke, you just need
to pick up some extra credit.

14:13.683 --> 14:15.584
Come do a play.

14:15.602 --> 14:17.586
I just lost my lead guy
to chicken pox.

14:17.604 --> 14:21.423
Uh, I don't do plays. No.
No. Not my thing.

14:21.441 --> 14:22.977
Come on.
You'll be surprised

14:22.978 --> 14:26.160
what a relief it is to walk in someone
else's shoes for a couple hours.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.654
Is this the guy the old
woman was telling you about?

14:30.655 --> 14:31.841
Where'd you get this?

14:31.842 --> 14:34.723
He's had a subscription with
the <i>Gazette</i> since water was invented.

14:34.727 --> 14:37.562
He only canceled it,
like, a year ago.

14:37.580 --> 14:38.830
So what do you think?

14:38.865 --> 14:41.566
I mean, it's worth a trip.
Let's go.

14:41.584 --> 14:43.001
Now?

14:43.036 --> 14:45.671
I gotta meet Luke.
Besides, he's <i>your</i> relative.

14:45.705 --> 14:48.245
- He's not gonna want to talk to me.
- No one wants to talk to you, Remy.

14:48.284 --> 14:49.908
You're the press.

14:49.926 --> 14:51.743
I've been here
less than a week.

14:51.761 --> 14:53.545
You have been here
your whole life.

14:53.579 --> 14:55.764
You can bring up local stuff,
jog his memory.

14:55.798 --> 14:57.849
I can't. There's no way
I'll be able to talk Luke

14:57.884 --> 14:59.264
into coming with us.
He's already so...

14:59.265 --> 15:00.919
I know.
I know where Luke is.

15:00.937 --> 15:03.472
All right, forget it.
I'll go by myself.

15:05.591 --> 15:06.925
Oh, my God.

15:06.943 --> 15:08.560
Caleb?

15:22.542 --> 15:24.493
<i>Go...</i>

15:26.713 --> 15:27.913
I'll drive.

15:36.830 --> 15:40.530
Excuse me. Um, I'm looking
for Mr. Rivers.

15:40.531 --> 15:42.682
We were told
that he might be here.

15:45.998 --> 15:47.865
Mr. Rivers?

15:48.933 --> 15:52.053
Um, my name's Caleb...
Rivers.

15:52.798 --> 15:54.465
I think we're family.

15:56.713 --> 15:58.630
I'm not sure
how we're related

15:58.665 --> 16:00.799
because I... I didn't know my
grandparents, but, uh...

16:00.834 --> 16:02.789
I know you had
an older brother named Caleb.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.686
Caleb?

16:51.515 --> 16:52.715
Caleb?

16:54.721 --> 16:55.921
You here?

17:09.685 --> 17:10.885
Caleb?!

17:16.310 --> 17:18.859
- Are... are you...
- Alone?

17:18.877 --> 17:22.107
Uh... All the time.

17:22.109 --> 17:25.727
I think your uncle knows
we were in here last night.

17:25.728 --> 17:29.194
- It's not surprising.
- He knows a lot.

17:31.931 --> 17:33.865
Caleb says he hides a lot,
too.

17:34.967 --> 17:37.075
Do you think he knows
why we're alive...

17:37.887 --> 17:39.671
Uh, you're not?

17:40.581 --> 17:42.416
Good question.

17:42.569 --> 17:44.937
Does he get rid of people
who ask too many?

17:44.988 --> 17:47.206
You think he had something
to do with your dad?

17:47.207 --> 17:48.407
Maybe.

17:49.725 --> 17:52.816
My... my mom made it sound like there
was something bad between them.

17:52.829 --> 17:54.830
So why aren't you
asking your mom?

17:54.864 --> 17:56.665
We don't...

17:56.699 --> 17:58.951
I can't talk to her anymore.

17:59.125 --> 18:01.876
Well, I'll tell you this...

18:01.911 --> 18:04.913
Uncle ray seems to be getting
sketchier by the minute.

18:04.964 --> 18:08.667
He's got clippings about your
dad's murder on his desk.

18:08.701 --> 18:10.835
When he's not
cutting up the paper

18:10.869 --> 18:13.004
or draining the neighbors,
he's holed up in that cave,

18:13.038 --> 18:15.039
fussing over his precious toys.

18:15.276 --> 18:16.476
He's in there now.

18:17.145 --> 18:18.760
There's a room with...

18:18.811 --> 18:23.487
Old tools of the trade...
Um, spin saws and picks.

18:23.488 --> 18:25.573
They never found the weapon.

18:25.985 --> 18:27.852
My father was stabbed.

18:27.886 --> 18:29.988
You should come back...

18:30.022 --> 18:31.823
When he's gone.

18:32.891 --> 18:34.091
I'll give you a tour.

18:37.062 --> 18:38.780
Where do you go...

18:38.831 --> 18:40.601
When you're not here?

18:40.634 --> 18:42.751
I'm sorry. You don't
have to answer that.

18:42.752 --> 18:44.870
It's okay.
It's not a secret.

18:45.070 --> 18:46.871
I'm here a lot.

18:46.905 --> 18:48.039
Kinda stuck.

18:48.073 --> 18:50.074
The house, that graveyard,

18:50.092 --> 18:52.877
this outfit... if I'd known
I'd be wearing it for eternity,

18:52.911 --> 18:54.198
I probably would've
changed boots.

18:54.199 --> 18:55.502
I like them.

18:55.541 --> 18:56.965
I mean, I could
never wear them.

18:57.016 --> 18:58.933
My mother wouldn't
let me leave the house.

18:58.934 --> 19:00.201
I'm sorry...

19:00.202 --> 19:03.209
- Wait... your mom has wardrobe approval?
- No...

19:03.889 --> 19:05.940
Yes. No, I...

19:05.975 --> 19:10.028
I just mean... She has this idea
of who I am... Who we are.

19:10.095 --> 19:13.622
If I leave the house with a button
that doesn't match, she...

19:13.625 --> 19:16.241
I'm sorry.
You apologize a lot.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.714
I just keep talking
about my mother, and I know...

19:18.715 --> 19:21.533
I can hear the word
without falling apart.

19:22.625 --> 19:26.436
It's just, um, wild to think
that I've spent my whole life

19:26.437 --> 19:28.894
wishing mine could tuck me in, while
yours had been tucking you in

19:28.895 --> 19:30.805
so tightly you could
barely move your arms.

19:30.833 --> 19:32.589
Or legs.

19:32.590 --> 19:35.459
I'm so... I'm not sorry.

19:40.009 --> 19:43.961
I just think it sucks that you came
all this way to find your family, and...

19:43.979 --> 19:46.648
And died?

19:46.682 --> 19:48.983
And still can't even
meet my mom?

19:49.018 --> 19:50.735
Tell me about it.

19:50.770 --> 19:53.638
Talk about a wasted trip.

19:53.656 --> 19:55.940
Maybe you're still here
so you can help us.

19:56.466 --> 20:01.437
I think I'm still here because... I'm
getting too attached to certain things...

20:02.065 --> 20:05.001
Or... certain people...

20:06.097 --> 20:09.899
Which is even more pathetic because
he's already attached to another girl.

20:12.719 --> 20:16.972
Miranda, I don't know
how to say this, but...

20:17.006 --> 20:19.874
You're not exactly <i>available.</i>

20:28.901 --> 20:30.602
You don't wanna do that.

20:30.653 --> 20:31.853
Here.

20:33.342 --> 20:35.657
Woodrow Wilson
had a wife like you.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.943
She ran the country for two years.

20:37.994 --> 20:39.778
You remember Woodrow Wilson?

20:39.829 --> 20:41.414
No, I never played chess
with him.

20:41.415 --> 20:43.533
I was born when he
was in the White House.

20:43.750 --> 20:45.584
You were born
in Ravenswood, right?

20:45.618 --> 20:46.918
All seven of us were.

20:46.953 --> 20:50.572
Only reason we stayed was because
my mother always thought he'd come back.

20:52.742 --> 20:55.544
- Your brother?
- My father.

20:55.578 --> 20:57.596
See when we lost Caleb,

20:57.630 --> 21:00.515
the earth opened up
and swallowed my father...

21:00.550 --> 21:02.718
- Swallowed him whole.
- Passed away?

21:02.752 --> 21:04.320
He disappeared.

21:04.971 --> 21:06.171
Your move.

21:10.693 --> 21:13.729
Did your father blame himself...
Or the town...

21:14.864 --> 21:16.565
For what happened to Caleb?

21:16.599 --> 21:18.866
Why don't you ask me
what you came to ask me?

21:22.872 --> 21:25.271
We were in a car accident...

21:25.941 --> 21:28.910
A few nights ago, and, uh,
there were five of us.

21:28.944 --> 21:31.580
One of us didn't make it.

21:31.614 --> 21:33.953
Since her funeral,
we've been hearing things...

21:34.692 --> 21:37.360
- About the town.
- What have you heard?

21:37.361 --> 21:39.646
Other kids
dying in "accidents"...

21:39.889 --> 21:43.491
Talk about something that
maybe happened a long time ago,

21:43.492 --> 21:45.331
something about a pact.

21:49.632 --> 21:51.068
Checkmate.

21:51.496 --> 21:53.347
Did you hear
what I just said?

21:53.686 --> 21:55.821
You're careless, boy.

21:55.855 --> 21:58.740
You got to pay more attention
to your moves.

21:59.826 --> 22:03.474
- Somebody take me back to my room?
- Yes, Mr. Rivers.

22:04.647 --> 22:06.402
<i>We are all connected...</i>

22:06.542 --> 22:09.987
In a way we don't fully
understand until it's too late.

22:10.369 --> 22:13.755
Thornton Wilder wanted this small
town to represent every small town,

22:13.790 --> 22:17.843
and every small town is really just
an extension of family.

22:19.829 --> 22:23.222
Luke. Come.
Join us.

22:23.599 --> 22:26.518
Guys, say "hello" to the newest
resident of Grover's Corners.

22:26.552 --> 22:27.836
Who's he playin'?

22:27.854 --> 22:29.950
George Gibbs.

22:30.556 --> 22:33.525
So basically,
<i>he's</i> marrying <i>you?</i>

22:33.559 --> 22:37.562
Oh, that is totally messed-up.

22:44.537 --> 22:47.739
<i>"Being here has made me
realize how much I love you."</i>

23:47.317 --> 23:48.517
Luke?

23:50.570 --> 23:55.589
Um, I'm gonna tell Price to find
someone else to play Emily.

23:55.661 --> 23:58.029
Don't worry about it.
Already dropped out.

23:58.080 --> 24:00.781
You just dropped <i>in.</i>

24:00.815 --> 24:02.667
What did you say to him?

24:04.586 --> 24:06.787
Look, practically
every kid in the school

24:06.821 --> 24:09.557
knows something ugly went down
between you and my sister.

24:09.558 --> 24:12.826
And me being up there
with you...

24:12.844 --> 24:15.112
Feels wrong. So...

24:16.848 --> 24:18.516
Can I just say one thing?

24:19.635 --> 24:22.180
- What?
- I miss Olivia.

24:22.804 --> 24:25.806
And if I could
take everything back, I would.

24:25.840 --> 24:29.694
- I'll pass that on.
- No, you won't.

24:29.728 --> 24:32.936
You still think that I'm a parasite...
That I used Livie as a V.I.P. pass

24:32.937 --> 24:35.553
to hang out with a certain
crowd, and you're right.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.050
Maybe I did.

24:38.904 --> 24:41.132
It's just that when
I was with her, I felt like...

24:42.908 --> 24:46.172
I could fool people into
thinking I'm something I'm not...

24:46.750 --> 24:48.663
Something as classy as her.

25:39.047 --> 25:41.799
<i>They never found the weapon.</i>

25:41.850 --> 25:43.684
<i>My father was stabbed.</i>

25:54.062 --> 25:55.763
<i>It's kinda weird.</i>

25:55.781 --> 25:59.372
Henry's father worked as a bailiff
at the courthouse for, like, 30 years.

25:59.373 --> 26:01.587
Then just disappeared
into thin air.

26:01.588 --> 26:03.871
Didn't anybody notice
he was gone?

26:03.905 --> 26:05.906
- I need to change my question.
- <i>What question?</i>

26:05.940 --> 26:08.368
My blog... there's no posts...
Nothing.

26:08.369 --> 26:09.960
Maybe Henry spread the word.

26:10.364 --> 26:12.314
"Keep your trap shut,
or else."

26:12.332 --> 26:15.533
- I doubt Henry's in the blogging crowd.
<i>- You never know.</i>

26:15.539 --> 26:18.320
Yeah, I do. My grandma's 20 years
younger than him,

26:18.338 --> 26:20.325
and she still calls my tablet
a "Maxi Pad."

26:20.326 --> 26:22.783
I don't know.
Maybe I went back there alone.

26:22.804 --> 26:26.375
- Take some chess lessons first.
- Hanging up now.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.056
What's wrong?

26:33.090 --> 26:35.058
You shouldn't stay here.

26:35.092 --> 26:37.093
We've had this discussion
already, remember?

26:37.111 --> 26:38.946
We were interrupted.

26:38.980 --> 26:40.795
And besides, I know more now.

26:40.796 --> 26:42.714
My uncle may be scarier
than we thought.

26:42.749 --> 26:45.931
Well, I met one of my uncles today,
and he wasn't exactly Kris Kringle.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.121
He didn't even blink
when I mentioned the pact.

26:48.156 --> 26:49.957
Just let it go, Caleb.

26:49.991 --> 26:53.109
Go back to Rosewood.
Leave here while you still can.

26:53.127 --> 26:54.828
You make that sound so easy.

26:55.594 --> 26:57.378
The e-mail to Hanna
is written.

26:57.379 --> 27:00.405
All you have to do is hit "send"
and get on the next bus out of here.

27:00.406 --> 27:02.213
What are you talking about?

27:07.479 --> 27:11.649
You wrote this? When?
Why? How?

27:11.684 --> 27:13.651
Caleb, do you really want
to spend our last days on earth

27:13.686 --> 27:16.333
digging for answers or being
with the person that you love?

27:16.614 --> 27:18.656
How am I supposed
to walk away from this?

27:18.691 --> 27:21.659
I forget about everything
that's happened this past week?

27:21.694 --> 27:23.578
Forget about what
you saw on the bridge?

27:23.612 --> 27:26.840
Forget about the fact that I'm linked
to the Caleb Rivers in that grave?

27:27.365 --> 27:29.066
Forget you?

27:34.906 --> 27:37.709
This isn't irritation,
Miranda.

27:39.461 --> 27:40.845
It's confusion.

27:51.923 --> 27:55.246
He never signed it,
but he lost the battle.

27:55.247 --> 27:56.755
Who? Who are you
talking about?

27:56.756 --> 27:58.998
But you must know
what you're up against, boy.

27:58.999 --> 28:00.616
You must know.

28:03.769 --> 28:08.439
- What is this?! Wait!
- I can't. It's your turn now.

28:22.557 --> 28:23.808
Can I see them?

28:26.561 --> 28:28.723
What was he talking about?
What "battle"?

28:28.739 --> 28:30.731
Are we dealing with someone
who's completely lost it?

28:30.765 --> 28:32.517
He whipped our butts
on the chess board.

28:32.518 --> 28:34.658
That doesn't mean he's not two
sandwiches short of a picnic.

28:34.659 --> 28:36.855
He's a human fossil.

28:36.856 --> 28:38.562
How can we trust
anything he says?

28:38.563 --> 28:41.467
You said Henry's father worked
as a county bailiff, right?

28:41.570 --> 28:44.220
- Yeah. Why?
- These keys are official.

28:44.221 --> 28:45.658
There's a county
stamp on them.

28:45.659 --> 28:48.461
- It's faded but it's there.
- So you're saying...?

28:48.462 --> 28:50.564
Our high school used to be
the county courthouse.

28:50.565 --> 28:53.283
There are a bunch of rooms in the basement
that have never even been renovated.

28:53.511 --> 28:54.759
How do you know that?

28:54.762 --> 28:57.445
I spent most of ninth grade
hanging out down there.

28:58.205 --> 29:01.381
So you think that one of these keys
fits into a door in your school?

29:01.382 --> 29:03.042
Gotta start somewhere.

29:12.858 --> 29:15.693
I spoke to him last night.
He said he'd be here.

29:15.744 --> 29:18.257
Did you mention that
I was still playing this part?

29:18.258 --> 29:20.948
He knows that.
Is there a problem?

29:24.002 --> 29:25.703
Sorry I'm late.

29:25.754 --> 29:27.654
Had to take the bike
into the shop.

29:27.672 --> 29:28.889
Is everything okay?

29:30.926 --> 29:33.794
Good. Why don't you two
work on the drug store scene?

29:33.828 --> 29:35.880
I'm gonna go set up the
auditorium for the third act.

29:35.931 --> 29:39.480
And if you have any questions,
save 'em for later.

29:42.837 --> 29:46.640
I have a question.
Why did you change your mind?

29:48.843 --> 29:50.811
I like the play.

29:50.845 --> 29:52.813
Does Olivia
know you're here?

29:52.847 --> 29:54.681
That's two questions.

30:04.626 --> 30:07.126
I'll show you the room
where I found the knife.

30:09.915 --> 30:11.799
It's this way.

30:11.833 --> 30:13.884
Isn't that where
he keeps the bodies?

30:13.919 --> 30:15.702
And more.

30:15.720 --> 30:17.838
You wanna... open it?

30:32.821 --> 30:34.721
This is the room?

30:34.739 --> 30:38.859
Oh, no. That's a door.
You... push it.

30:48.069 --> 30:49.703
You need to see the knife.

30:50.789 --> 30:52.706
So, uh,

30:52.740 --> 30:55.042
look around all you want.
But I wouldn't touch anything.

30:55.076 --> 30:57.363
He can tell if you've
breathed in here.

30:59.484 --> 31:00.747
<i>I don't get it...</i>

31:00.765 --> 31:03.017
These characters getting married
when they hardly know each other.

31:03.051 --> 31:05.586
They have one date,
then a wedding.

31:05.604 --> 31:09.923
It was a different time. Mr. Price says
they're "old souls wrapped in innocence."

31:09.941 --> 31:11.775
Whatever that means.

31:11.810 --> 31:13.594
Life was tough back then.

31:13.612 --> 31:15.779
People died in childbirth.

31:15.814 --> 31:17.392
People still die.

31:19.227 --> 31:20.644
True.

31:21.069 --> 31:25.772
But I guess they were just able to hold
onto their innocence a little bit longer.

31:25.790 --> 31:28.587
I don't think that's such
a terrible thing. Do you?

31:31.601 --> 31:33.780
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:33.798 --> 31:36.800
- Why did you do that?
- Uh, I wanted to get it over with

31:36.835 --> 31:38.535
so you didn't do that
in front of the entire cast.

31:38.536 --> 31:41.722
- Do what?
- Look like you wanna puke.

31:41.756 --> 31:43.841
It's okay. I'll ask Mr. Price
to cut the kiss.

31:43.892 --> 31:45.792
Hol... just...

31:45.810 --> 31:47.794
- I didn't think you were gonna jump me...
- Forget about it.

31:47.812 --> 31:51.285
It's fine. We can just say
"I do" and shake hands.

31:52.382 --> 31:56.285
Well can we just wait till we get
to the scene and then the...

31:56.738 --> 31:58.689
Ease into it?

31:58.740 --> 32:00.774
No, thanks.

32:00.808 --> 32:04.027
This is "honey-roasted penis"
all over again.

32:05.813 --> 32:08.532
- Excuse me?
- Oh, come on, Luke.

32:08.583 --> 32:10.951
- Don't act like you never knew.
- I...

32:10.985 --> 32:12.670
I don't know what you're...

32:12.704 --> 32:16.707
Seventh grade. I had a mouth
full of metal and a lisp.

32:16.758 --> 32:18.876
At spring carnival,
I ordered a bag of nuts,

32:18.927 --> 32:20.827
and that was my nickname
for a year.

32:23.665 --> 32:25.666
You asked for a bag
of "honey-roasted penis"?

32:26.834 --> 32:28.636
Can we just do the scene,
please?

32:38.897 --> 32:40.564
Okay.

32:41.655 --> 32:44.071
We don't have to shake hands.

32:44.155 --> 32:45.550
So...

32:45.870 --> 32:49.573
<i>- What is that?</i>
- Um, in bio, they called it a heart.

32:55.029 --> 32:57.665
Huh. What is this?

32:58.717 --> 33:00.551
Looks like hair.

33:04.556 --> 33:07.007
Why would he have these?
Who's hair is this?

33:09.761 --> 33:13.814
- Wait, what was Abby's last name, again?
- Wheeler. Why?

33:13.848 --> 33:17.851
"A. W." In '92.
That must be her.

33:19.938 --> 33:21.572
Oh, my God.
What's happening?

33:21.606 --> 33:25.693
- Miranda, what are you looking for?
- That. That's my hair.

33:27.049 --> 33:29.751
Does he have one of these
for every kid in this town who...

33:29.752 --> 33:31.915
Who what?
Who... who died?

33:31.950 --> 33:35.619
No, he does not get to add <i>me</i>
<i>to his souvenir collection.</i>

33:35.670 --> 33:37.670
- Miranda...
- He won't come near me when I'm alive

33:37.672 --> 33:39.623
but thinks he can
keep some of me when I'm dead?!

33:39.674 --> 33:42.576
He thinks he can rip me apart
and shove me in a cabinet?!

34:12.824 --> 34:14.289
Oh, my God.

34:34.763 --> 34:36.429
Want me to try?

34:36.464 --> 34:38.431
No, I got it.

34:38.466 --> 34:39.734
I may not know a pawn
from a rook,

34:39.768 --> 34:42.402
but I definitely don't need
lessons in busting locks.

34:43.605 --> 34:45.014
Doesn't go to this door.

34:45.061 --> 34:47.491
It's rusty.
Probably needs to be cleaned.

34:47.525 --> 34:50.025
It's been hanging around
your uncle's neck for 70 years.

34:50.056 --> 34:51.775
What'd they
use these rooms for?

34:51.826 --> 34:54.744
- When it was a courthouse?
- Some of them were jail cells.

34:54.779 --> 34:56.728
Let's get out of here.

34:57.727 --> 34:59.426
No, wait!
There's one more door.

35:18.712 --> 35:21.054
Why would the school
leave all this stuff down here?

35:21.088 --> 35:22.922
Why are you asking me?

35:22.940 --> 35:25.725
Well, you did spend
ninth grade down here.

35:26.565 --> 35:27.765
Not in this room.

35:37.004 --> 35:38.204
What's this?

35:40.370 --> 35:41.570
Try it.

35:49.638 --> 35:51.505
You're kidding.

35:51.539 --> 35:53.391
It's rusty.

35:53.425 --> 35:55.593
It's been around an old
man's neck for 70 years.

35:57.879 --> 35:59.789
<i>Can I get all</i>
<i>the ghosts over here, please?</i>

35:59.815 --> 36:02.182
This is our graveyard.

36:02.213 --> 36:06.224
I need Mrs. Soames, Mrs. Gibbs, and
Emily right up here in the front row.

36:06.225 --> 36:08.175
Tess?

36:08.573 --> 36:10.150
Care to join us, please?

36:14.613 --> 36:18.565
I need Joe Stoddard,
Sam Craig up over there.

36:18.583 --> 36:21.174
George, you'll enter
from downstage.

36:21.175 --> 36:22.736
Let's go over the blocking,
guys.

36:22.754 --> 36:25.131
If we know the moves,
we are halfway there.

36:28.739 --> 36:30.606
Is Caleb here?

36:31.630 --> 36:33.964
Luke? Luke?

36:34.850 --> 36:36.717
You just hear what I said?

36:40.772 --> 36:43.691
Just gonna... get some water.

36:44.053 --> 36:47.605
<i>Can I have all the dead
townsfolk looking over here, please?</i>

36:50.565 --> 36:52.065
<i>Miranda?</i>

36:53.785 --> 36:55.368
<i>Miranda...</i>

37:12.637 --> 37:13.837
Mom?

37:32.741 --> 37:35.238
Luke, you've gotta come with us.

37:35.239 --> 37:37.478
- What?
- I was inside Collins' house.

37:37.496 --> 37:40.498
Didn't I tell you not to go back there?
You went, and she's back.

37:40.532 --> 37:42.483
Who's back? Miranda?

37:42.501 --> 37:44.348
- Where? Where is she?
- On the stage.

37:45.787 --> 37:48.589
Don't do... please.
Don't. Don't. Not...

37:49.824 --> 37:51.858
Yes, Tess,
you had a question?

37:52.761 --> 37:56.380
Yeah, um, at the bottom of this page,
when Emily's talking to her mom,

37:56.431 --> 37:58.382
do you think she's,
like, angry with her?

37:58.433 --> 38:00.551
That's definitely
one way to look at it.

38:00.602 --> 38:03.471
She... maybe she's...
She is angry about it.

38:03.505 --> 38:05.689
Think deep down,
she's probably just...

38:05.724 --> 38:07.391
Luke, we are so close to
finding the truth.

38:07.442 --> 38:10.326
Caleb has an uncle who knows
about the pact, and he gave him this.

38:10.352 --> 38:12.324
- Not... I'm not a part of this.
- I'm not a part of this.

38:12.325 --> 38:14.515
We were all in that car.
You don't have a choice.

38:16.368 --> 38:17.897
Look out!

38:29.910 --> 38:31.878
Still think you're
not a part of this?

38:43.896 --> 38:46.611
Caleb took the box
back to his place.

38:46.612 --> 38:50.166
Whatever's inside may have nothing
to do with us, but the key did fit.

38:51.056 --> 38:52.607
What are you looking at?

38:55.727 --> 38:57.561
I kissed Tess today.

38:58.730 --> 38:59.930
What?

39:00.949 --> 39:02.900
We were practicing.
I kissed her.

39:05.871 --> 39:08.189
But it had to do
with the play, right?

39:10.430 --> 39:11.630
I'm not sure.

39:16.552 --> 39:19.504
Whatever it was,
it made me feel like...

39:19.522 --> 39:21.339
Like us...

39:22.525 --> 39:24.526
- Before this.
- Before what?

39:24.560 --> 39:25.760
This.

39:26.696 --> 39:30.482
I don't need anybody telling me that I'm
living with a curse. I already know that.

39:30.516 --> 39:32.317
- Luke...
- My dad's gone.

39:34.320 --> 39:36.029
He's never coming back.

39:37.540 --> 39:40.709
My... my whole life changed
while I wasn't paying attention,

39:40.743 --> 39:43.237
and I can't be around people
who constantly remind me

39:43.238 --> 39:44.663
it's only gonna get worse.

39:44.697 --> 39:47.734
You can't ask me to unknow what
I already know.

39:48.551 --> 39:50.635
I wanna be with someone
who makes me...

39:50.670 --> 39:52.537
Laugh...

39:52.555 --> 39:56.675
Doesn't talk about pacts, and patterns,
and tells me that the sky is falling.

39:56.709 --> 39:58.455
I can't. I can't.

40:01.481 --> 40:02.681
Hey, there.

40:05.768 --> 40:07.860
Didn't mean to interrupt.

40:08.721 --> 40:12.574
Remy, if you two wanted
to rent a movie...

40:12.608 --> 40:14.359
Luke can't stay.

40:16.412 --> 40:18.447
Thank you for the offer,
Mr. Beaumont.

40:18.498 --> 40:20.398
Appreciate it.

40:20.845 --> 40:22.610
We'll talk later, right?

40:31.794 --> 40:33.938
Did you ask him
to leave because of me?

40:33.939 --> 40:36.774
No. He needed to be
someplace else.

40:43.192 --> 40:45.590
Why are you keeping pieces
of her in this room?

40:46.192 --> 40:49.169
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about!

40:49.170 --> 40:51.955
If I did, I wouldn't
have asked the question.

40:51.956 --> 40:53.690
We are on to you.

40:53.818 --> 40:56.831
- So is Miranda.
- We buried Miranda last week.

40:56.832 --> 40:58.916
Yeah? Where is she now?

40:59.137 --> 41:00.921
What did you do with her?!

41:00.922 --> 41:02.693
If this is the shape
your grief has taken...

41:02.694 --> 41:04.695
I'm not here
to be counseled, okay?!

41:05.113 --> 41:07.698
I just wanna know why
you're keeping this collection!

41:10.460 --> 41:14.419
I'm guessing this isn't
your first time in this room.

41:15.628 --> 41:17.762
And if you intend
to stay on as my caretaker,

41:17.796 --> 41:22.433
you'll <i>take care</i> to stay out of rooms
where you're not invited.

41:22.468 --> 41:24.552
Is that clear?

41:24.586 --> 41:26.638
I won't be here much longer.

41:26.689 --> 41:30.627
I'm guessing you already have
that marked on your calendar.
