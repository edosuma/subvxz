WEBVTT

00:02.383 --> 00:06.234
It's 10:27 and President
Dalton is still trailing.

00:06.235 --> 00:08.333
Now, were you expecting
it to be this close?

00:08.334 --> 00:11.463
- No one was...
- Santa Fe results are coming in fast.

00:11.490 --> 00:13.392
Projections still have him
down by three points.

00:13.393 --> 00:14.526
Well, forget the projection.

00:14.527 --> 00:16.261
Our ground game was better in Santa Fe.

00:16.262 --> 00:17.663
We can still close this gap.

00:17.664 --> 00:19.631
I think it's safe to say
the Dalton campaign

00:19.632 --> 00:20.833
took New Mexico for granted.

00:20.834 --> 00:22.468
- He had a ground operation
- (various phones ringing)

00:22.469 --> 00:24.503
twice the size of Evans, didn't matter.

00:24.504 --> 00:26.727
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
ready to make a projection.

00:26.728 --> 00:28.574
- DALTON: What?
- This is wrong.

00:28.575 --> 00:30.309
New Mexico will not go to Dalton.

00:30.310 --> 00:33.378
That makes it official,
he has lost the race.

00:33.379 --> 00:36.582
President Conrad Dalton
will be a one-term president.

00:36.583 --> 00:39.251
Can't make a projection
when-when it's this tight.

00:39.252 --> 00:41.653
20% of the vote is still uncounted.

00:41.654 --> 00:43.055
AP just made the same call.

00:43.056 --> 00:45.524
- (phone beeping)
- What the hell happened to margin of error?

00:45.525 --> 00:47.658
It's over, Russell.

00:51.663 --> 00:55.033
If it's all the same to everyone,

00:55.034 --> 00:57.402
I'd prefer to do the
postmortem tomorrow.

00:57.403 --> 01:00.638
It was a good fight.

Starboard engine is down.

01:29.702 --> 01:31.202
Let's jump for it.

01:33.105 --> 01:35.774
Evacuate the crew.

01:35.775 --> 01:37.975
Yes, sir.

01:39.645 --> 01:41.747
Throw!

01:41.748 --> 01:43.248
Move back now!

01:43.249 --> 01:44.349
Everybody off.

01:44.350 --> 01:47.820
(men yelling indistinctly)

01:47.821 --> 01:49.521
Evacuate!

01:49.522 --> 01:52.757
Evacuate the area!

01:59.198 --> 02:01.300
- (screams, then splash)
- Man overboard!

02:01.301 --> 02:03.902
SAILOR: Kelley! Kelley!

02:03.903 --> 02:06.772
JESSICA: <i>Madam Secretary, you'll open</i>

02:06.773 --> 02:08.106
with some general remarks.

02:08.107 --> 02:10.309
Then you'll head over to
the pig-judging contest.

02:10.310 --> 02:13.478
You won't be required
to handle the pigs.

02:13.479 --> 02:15.747
Which is excellent news.

02:15.748 --> 02:18.483
Yeah, just comment on
their general appearance.

02:18.484 --> 02:22.654
And I'd advise avoiding
words like "fat" or "tasty"

02:22.655 --> 02:26.458
because people don't really
want to think about that.

02:26.459 --> 02:30.329
Couldn't you have gotten me
the zucchini-judging contest?

02:30.330 --> 02:32.865
- A lot fewer pitfalls.
- NADINE: Nominally,

02:32.866 --> 02:35.767
you'll be promoting
American agricultural exports.

02:35.768 --> 02:37.903
- Without saying "tasty."
- Mm-hmm.

02:37.904 --> 02:39.204
Or "fat."

02:39.205 --> 02:40.505
Or "food."

02:40.506 --> 02:41.840
- Or "pork."
- Yes.

02:41.841 --> 02:44.343
But, as Jessica explained to me,

02:44.344 --> 02:45.677
albeit in language

02:45.678 --> 02:47.613
more befitting a political strategist,

02:47.614 --> 02:49.314
it's an opportunity to do some

02:49.315 --> 02:51.550
glad-handing with the Virginia locals.

02:51.551 --> 02:53.185
JESSICA: Yeah, just to kick things off

02:53.186 --> 02:54.319
in a fun way.

02:54.320 --> 02:55.320
Of course, we have a number

02:55.321 --> 02:56.588
of savvy public profile boosts

02:56.589 --> 02:58.056
coming up for you and your family.

02:58.057 --> 03:00.058
NADINE: Right, tonight
you have your dinner

03:00.059 --> 03:01.793
with the president's big-ticket donors.

03:01.794 --> 03:04.029
And tomorrow you have a
segment on Jane Pauley's show

03:04.030 --> 03:06.698
to discuss foreign policy developments.

03:06.699 --> 03:08.333
But not pork.

03:08.334 --> 03:10.695
And definitely no mention of
your accepting the VP position.

03:10.696 --> 03:12.439
President Dalton will
make that announcement

03:12.440 --> 03:14.206
after the convention in July.

03:14.207 --> 03:15.741
But Jane will ask.

03:15.742 --> 03:18.911
Yes, Jane will ask and
you'll say something like...

03:18.912 --> 03:22.514
"I could use a fat and
tasty pulled pork sandwich

03:22.515 --> 03:23.782
right about now."

03:23.783 --> 03:24.783
(laughter)

03:24.784 --> 03:26.018
(phone chimes)

03:26.019 --> 03:28.082
JESSICA: After the contest,
there will be a photo op

03:28.083 --> 03:29.788
with the mayor and the
county commissioner.

03:29.789 --> 03:31.957
Uh, e-excuse me, Madam Secretary,

03:31.958 --> 03:33.125
I'm receiving word that

03:33.126 --> 03:34.726
our naval base in Bahrain

03:34.727 --> 03:37.496
has been hit by a massive
tropical cyclone.

03:37.497 --> 03:38.897
No fatalities reported,

03:38.898 --> 03:41.600
but the base has
sustained major damage.

03:41.601 --> 03:42.868
How major?

03:42.869 --> 03:46.171
That base just had an update,
like, two years ago.

03:46.172 --> 03:47.873
I'll get more information.

03:47.874 --> 03:49.308
DoD is monitoring the situation.

03:49.309 --> 03:51.243
All right.

03:51.244 --> 03:54.646
Do you have a list of
acceptable adjectives?

03:54.647 --> 03:57.215
For the pigs.

03:57.216 --> 04:00.352
My research says they're
very intelligent animals.

04:00.353 --> 04:02.988
Really, that doesn't sound elitist?

04:02.989 --> 04:04.756
(animals chattering)

04:04.757 --> 04:06.358
WOMAN: Madam Secretary?

04:06.359 --> 04:07.592
- Yes.
- Hi.

04:07.593 --> 04:09.227
- Ooh. Oh, my goodness.
- Oh.

04:09.228 --> 04:10.362
Isn't she...

04:10.363 --> 04:13.498
She's so cute. Oh, my God.

04:13.499 --> 04:15.667
(bell ringing)

04:15.668 --> 04:17.769
(cheering)

04:17.769 --> 04:18.803
(chuckles)

04:18.805 --> 04:21.105
(indistinct conversations)

04:23.809 --> 04:24.810
(applause)

04:25.878 --> 04:27.412
ELIZABETH: <i>Agriculture has long been</i>

04:27.413 --> 04:30.182
the foundation of this country,
beginning, as it did,

04:30.183 --> 04:32.117
right here in the great Commonwealth

04:32.118 --> 04:33.585
of Virginia,

04:33.586 --> 04:38.090
a land which has yielded
so many valuable resources.

04:38.091 --> 04:41.516
And nothing exemplifies that more

04:41.517 --> 04:44.529
than these delicious
fried gelatin balls

04:44.530 --> 04:46.098
that my son just handed me.

04:46.099 --> 04:47.165
(laughter)

04:47.166 --> 04:48.433
I think he tried to

04:48.434 --> 04:49.901
offer 'em to the pigs first,

04:49.902 --> 04:53.739
but no takers 'cause,
as our research tells us,

04:53.740 --> 04:56.441
they are highly intelligent animals.

04:56.442 --> 04:57.976
- (crowd laughs)
- Crowd loves her.

04:57.977 --> 05:00.478
Yes, they do.

05:01.046 --> 05:02.280
ELIZABETH: <i>It turns out</i>

05:02.281 --> 05:05.450
- you can fry anything.
- (chuckles)

05:05.451 --> 05:07.452
You were a huge hit at the fair, ma'am.

05:07.453 --> 05:09.087
Your pig remark is trending.

05:09.088 --> 05:11.490
Wow, take that, Lincoln
and your Gettysburg Address.

05:11.491 --> 05:14.126
I am going to be known
for the pig remark.

05:14.127 --> 05:16.094
Yeah, and no fallout
from the gelatin lobby

05:16.095 --> 05:18.096
because they don't recommend
frying their product.

05:18.097 --> 05:18.777
They're right.

05:18.778 --> 05:20.476
JAY: And that's the
last of the good news

05:20.477 --> 05:22.060
because we need to
brief you on Bahrain.

05:22.061 --> 05:23.969
Still no fatalities, last I heard.

05:23.970 --> 05:26.705
37 injured, 36 in good condition.

05:26.706 --> 05:28.473
Hey, any update on Ensign...

05:28.474 --> 05:30.142
- NADINE: Ensign Kelley, yes, ma'am.
- Oh.

05:30.143 --> 05:31.643
He remains in critical condition.

05:31.644 --> 05:33.078
He's in a medically induced coma

05:33.079 --> 05:34.413
at a hospital in Manama.

05:34.414 --> 05:35.580
But the base itself

05:35.581 --> 05:39.384
has taken billions of
dollars' worth of damage

05:39.385 --> 05:41.653
State will need to consult
with DoD to renegotiate

05:41.654 --> 05:44.122
Bahrain's out-of-date
Defense Cooperation Agreement

05:44.123 --> 05:46.324
before another
reconstruction can start.

05:46.325 --> 05:48.348
By Defense Cooperation
Agreement you mean all those

05:48.349 --> 05:50.228
no-bid contracts with
American companies

05:50.229 --> 05:52.664
left over from the
previous administration?

05:52.665 --> 05:54.366
That's the one.

05:54.367 --> 05:56.435
Why are we renewing this agreement?

05:56.436 --> 05:57.903
We're less and less reliant

05:57.904 --> 05:59.704
on oil from the Persian Gulf.

05:59.705 --> 06:00.939
And our peace deal with Iran

06:00.940 --> 06:02.974
makes it strategically less important.

06:02.975 --> 06:05.277
And Bahrain's human rights'
record has always been bleak.

06:05.278 --> 06:09.281
It's just gotten worse since
Prince Obaid was assassinated.

06:09.282 --> 06:11.683
Why should we spend billions of dollars

06:11.684 --> 06:14.820
in a country that shares
none of our most basic values?

06:14.821 --> 06:17.389
Well, the primary goal is
to monitor shipping routes.

06:17.390 --> 06:18.723
Once again,

06:18.724 --> 06:20.892
it's a case of supporting
the nations that provide us

06:20.893 --> 06:23.028
with the greatest economic advantage,

06:23.029 --> 06:26.832
not those who value democracy
and freedom over...

06:26.833 --> 06:29.534
Yes, Matt, my question
was largely rhetorical.

06:29.535 --> 06:31.703
But I appreciate you being at the ready

06:31.704 --> 06:34.539
- with your political ire.
- Well, I'm always here for you, ma'am.

06:34.540 --> 06:37.742
All right, Jay, you should
go ahead and liaise with DoD

06:37.743 --> 06:39.845
about the agreement renegotiation.

06:39.846 --> 06:41.513
But I want to check in
with the president.

06:41.514 --> 06:43.737
Which you can do at the dinner
for his big-ticket donors

06:43.738 --> 06:45.117
in exactly two hours,

06:45.118 --> 06:46.901
leaving you enough time
to go home and change

06:46.902 --> 06:49.454
- if you leave right now.
- Uh, Madam Secretary,

06:49.455 --> 06:52.357
Zuhair Mossadek, the foreign
minister from Tunisia,

06:52.358 --> 06:54.192
is waiting for you in my office.

06:54.193 --> 06:56.595
You scheduled 15 minutes
with him months ago.

06:56.596 --> 06:58.082
Would you prefer that I take
that meeting without you?

06:58.083 --> 07:00.198
No, no, no, no, no.
I-I... just go get him.

07:00.199 --> 07:02.234
If I skip my updo, I can give him...

07:02.235 --> 07:03.301
ten minutes stationary,

07:03.302 --> 07:04.769
five on the move.

07:04.770 --> 07:07.539
Come on, guys, get rid of this.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.908
Okay, am I the only one
worried that this primary

07:09.909 --> 07:11.076
is a little too exciting

07:11.077 --> 07:12.410
for an incumbent president?

07:12.411 --> 07:13.712
Dalton's polls aren't great.

07:13.713 --> 07:16.148
- Sam Evans' numbers are rising.
- Nobody's gonna vote

07:16.149 --> 07:17.682
for the governor from Pennsylvania.

07:17.683 --> 07:19.084
I mean, what's his platform?

07:19.085 --> 07:20.051
Cheesesteaks?

07:20.052 --> 07:21.686
American-made chocolate? (chuckles)

07:21.687 --> 07:23.688
There's a reason why there's
never been a president

07:23.689 --> 07:24.656
from Pennsylvania.

07:24.657 --> 07:26.525
- James Buchanan.
- Like I said.

07:26.526 --> 07:28.360
JAY: Evans is hammering

07:28.361 --> 07:30.095
on national security,
Dalton's peace treaty with Iran,

07:30.096 --> 07:32.079
- the Buckley trade.
- BLAKE: He would have to win

07:32.080 --> 07:33.932
landslide victories in
every remaining primary

07:33.933 --> 07:34.966
to get the nomination.

07:34.967 --> 07:36.101
It's practically impossible.

07:36.102 --> 07:37.869
Yeah.

07:37.870 --> 07:40.372
Practically.

07:40.373 --> 07:41.806
May I remind you that our country

07:41.807 --> 07:44.409
was the spark that lit
the Arab Spring in 2011,

07:44.410 --> 07:46.411
and years later we're
the only Arab country

07:46.412 --> 07:48.513
that emerged with a
functioning democracy.

07:48.514 --> 07:50.315
We have no sectarian divisions,

07:50.316 --> 07:52.551
a history of moderate Islam,

07:52.552 --> 07:54.653
widespread literacy, and a small army

07:54.654 --> 07:56.388
loyal to a civilian government.

07:56.389 --> 07:57.989
We're the best hope in the Muslim world

07:57.990 --> 07:59.333
and you know it, Madam Secretary.

07:59.334 --> 08:01.026
And I assure you that everyone

08:01.027 --> 08:02.394
in the president's administration

08:02.395 --> 08:03.628
is aware of that.

08:03.629 --> 08:05.197
So, I'd like to believe the only reason

08:05.198 --> 08:07.232
I'm reduced to following
you to the elevator

08:07.233 --> 08:09.100
to achieve a full 15
minutes of your time

08:09.101 --> 08:12.237
is not because we lack
oil or other resources

08:12.238 --> 08:14.206
for the United States to exploit.

08:14.207 --> 08:16.174
But, well, you can
understand why I might

08:16.175 --> 08:17.142
have that impression.

08:17.143 --> 08:19.778
We appreciate the direction

08:19.779 --> 08:20.845
your country is headed

08:20.846 --> 08:22.180
and we are optimistic that

08:22.181 --> 08:24.649
we can further our good relations.

08:24.650 --> 08:28.420
And as I said,
I will do everything I can.

08:28.421 --> 08:29.964
I never thought that the United States

08:29.965 --> 08:31.256
was a country which acted

08:31.257 --> 08:34.192
entirely out of strategic advantage.

08:34.193 --> 08:36.528
For that, I can depend
on Russia or China.

08:36.529 --> 08:39.296
I thought you represented
something more.

08:42.634 --> 08:45.203
Perhaps I'm just an idealist.

08:45.204 --> 08:47.504
That's what comes from
being a democracy.

08:50.242 --> 08:52.410
HENRY: <i>And we'll pick up
tomorrow with Augustine.</i>

08:52.411 --> 08:55.413
Well, well, look at this.

08:55.414 --> 08:56.448
Did you happen

08:56.449 --> 08:58.049
to catch any philosophy?

08:58.050 --> 08:59.651
Yeah, but I got a strong immune system.

08:59.652 --> 09:00.619
Uh-huh.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.220
(chuckles)

09:02.221 --> 09:03.488
You have time for coffee?

09:03.489 --> 09:05.223
Or better yet, happy hour?

09:05.224 --> 09:06.157
I can't.

09:06.158 --> 09:07.959
I've got an event with Elizabeth.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.728
Then I guess I'll do the quick version.

09:11.517 --> 09:12.998
We're getting the band back together.

09:12.999 --> 09:14.032
They sent me

09:14.033 --> 09:14.966
to talk you into it.

09:14.967 --> 09:16.101
Murphy Station? Why?

09:16.102 --> 09:17.335
Black Dog Station.

09:17.336 --> 09:18.670
- New mission.
- Wow.

09:18.671 --> 09:20.705
Russell has got to stop
with the code names.

09:20.706 --> 09:22.040
(chuckles)

09:22.041 --> 09:23.408
What's the objective?

09:23.409 --> 09:25.910
Intel has located
some surviving members

09:25.911 --> 09:28.246
of Hizb Al-Shahid in Libya and Algeria.

09:28.247 --> 09:29.550
Seems that's where they decamped

09:29.551 --> 09:30.982
after the drone attacks.

09:30.983 --> 09:32.450
They want us to finish the job.

09:32.451 --> 09:37.489
Well, look, Jose, as much as I
enjoyed almost dying with you...

09:37.490 --> 09:38.456
Stop whining.

09:38.457 --> 09:39.658
You didn't get a scratch.

09:39.659 --> 09:41.259
Oh, hey, don't forget who performed

09:41.260 --> 09:42.427
the fake last rites on you.

09:42.428 --> 09:44.129
Yeah, and heaven spit me back out.

09:44.130 --> 09:46.264
You can thank me for that, too.

09:46.265 --> 09:48.233
Look...

09:48.234 --> 09:49.601
I just started teaching again

09:49.602 --> 09:53.004
and I'm really enjoying having
more time with my family.

09:53.005 --> 09:54.506
Really?

09:54.507 --> 09:57.741
You're gonna sit this out
for Monday night Monopoly?

09:58.843 --> 10:00.812
I didn't get into this
for the adventure.

10:00.813 --> 10:03.381
I know.

10:03.382 --> 10:05.450
You're a great patriot

10:05.451 --> 10:07.419
and the country needs you, pal.

10:07.420 --> 10:10.220
And I don't have time to haze
another religious egghead.

10:10.989 --> 10:12.924
Well, when you put it like that,

10:12.925 --> 10:14.259
I'll think about it.

10:14.260 --> 10:15.493
Okay.

10:15.494 --> 10:16.895
I'll tell them you're in.

10:16.896 --> 10:18.363
(sighs)

10:18.364 --> 10:19.596
I didn't say that.

10:25.270 --> 10:27.138
This draft looks solid.

10:27.139 --> 10:29.274
Remember, any adjustment
to the rotation schedule

10:29.275 --> 10:31.710
has to meet the definition of
minimum credible deterrence,

10:31.711 --> 10:34.279
so make sure we include
language saying that

10:34.280 --> 10:35.480
the Bahrainis have to consult

10:35.481 --> 10:36.704
with the Secretary of the Navy

10:36.705 --> 10:39.351
- before closing any facilities.
- Got it.

10:39.352 --> 10:42.187
Other than that, we're good to go.

10:42.188 --> 10:44.723
I guess I'll see you next
storm of the century.

10:44.724 --> 10:46.591
Yeah, which will be in what,
about three years?

10:46.592 --> 10:47.592
Let's hope not.

10:47.593 --> 10:49.426
Sure, let's hope. That ought to work.

10:50.261 --> 10:52.964
I'm sorry. It's a bug up my ass.

10:52.965 --> 10:55.400
Just four years ago, the base
in Singapore was hit with

10:55.401 --> 10:57.602
a similar once in a lifetime storm.

10:57.603 --> 10:58.870
Billions of dollars in damage.

10:58.871 --> 11:02.474
These weather events
are happening every year.

11:02.475 --> 11:05.210
And all our internal reports
are falling on deaf ears.

11:05.211 --> 11:07.545
Sea levels are rising.

11:07.546 --> 11:09.147
And what we should be doing is

11:09.148 --> 11:11.915
raising every single U.S.
naval base around the world.

11:13.451 --> 11:15.620
But we both know that'll never happen.

11:15.621 --> 11:17.021
How do we know that?

11:17.022 --> 11:19.056
Ask your boss.

11:21.226 --> 11:24.262
(soft piano music playing,
indistinct chatter)

11:24.263 --> 11:26.564
HENRY: I dare you to yell out
"capital gains tax,"

11:26.565 --> 11:27.699
see what happens.

11:27.700 --> 11:30.101
- ELIZABETH: Be safer to yell "fire."
- (chuckles)

11:30.102 --> 11:32.637
- (takes deep breath) Okay.
- (clears throat)

11:32.638 --> 11:34.706
Here we go. Deep breath.

11:34.707 --> 11:36.741
(inhales) Be nice.

11:36.742 --> 11:38.276
What? I'm an ethics teacher.

11:38.277 --> 11:40.712
- I was talking to myself.
- (both laugh)

11:40.713 --> 11:42.380
JACKSON: Okay. So, here's the deal.

11:42.381 --> 11:45.283
You need to charm the
pants off everyone here,

11:45.284 --> 11:47.385
'cause we need their full
support for you as VP.

11:47.386 --> 11:48.653
- Okay.
- You got it?

11:48.654 --> 11:49.988
- Hey.
- Hi, Russell.

11:49.989 --> 11:52.023
Try not to talk about religion.

11:52.024 --> 11:54.407
- No, I only do that for a salary.
- (chuckles) - Great. So,

11:54.408 --> 11:56.861
Bess, first things first.

11:56.862 --> 11:58.263
You need to meet Julius Burton.

11:58.264 --> 12:00.098
ELIZABETH: Lead the way.

12:00.099 --> 12:01.366
Bar.

12:01.367 --> 12:02.734
Yeah.

12:02.735 --> 12:05.770
So, what else do I need to know,
other than billionaire,

12:05.771 --> 12:09.307
multinational conglomerate,
key government contracts,

12:09.308 --> 12:12.577
married for 32 years to Dixie...
if I read that right...

12:12.578 --> 12:14.646
two sons and four grandchildren?

12:14.647 --> 12:16.848
He's a birder.

12:16.849 --> 12:19.551
He watches birds.
You know, with binoculars.

12:19.552 --> 12:21.419
For some reason, people do that.

12:21.420 --> 12:22.821
Julius!

12:22.822 --> 12:26.424
- Madam Secretary, a pleasure to
meet you at last. - (chuckles)

12:26.425 --> 12:28.226
Even more lovely in person.

12:28.227 --> 12:30.161
- Well, thank you, Mr. Burton.
- Julius.

12:30.162 --> 12:32.030
Uh, is Dixie here tonight?

12:32.031 --> 12:34.933
We lost her to the caviar table.

12:34.934 --> 12:36.568
- (laughing): Oh.
- (laughs)

12:36.569 --> 12:39.671
I hope you won't mind
a moment of shop talk.

12:39.672 --> 12:41.439
Oh. Please.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.675
How is the refurbishment process going,

12:43.676 --> 12:45.477
on the naval base in Bahrain?

12:45.478 --> 12:50.014
I heard that your policy guy
met with somebody in DoD

12:50.015 --> 12:51.398
- just this afternoon.
- Redrafting

12:51.399 --> 12:54.319
the Defense Cooperation Agreement, yes.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.287
I hope that you will
make this a priority.

12:56.288 --> 13:00.692
I know the State can get
distracted with other matters,

13:00.693 --> 13:04.395
but it is dangerous to leave
our military needs stranded.

13:04.396 --> 13:06.764
I understand. W... we actually...

13:06.765 --> 13:08.166
were a military family

13:08.167 --> 13:10.401
- for a long time...
- The world is safer

13:10.402 --> 13:11.669
when our bases are safer.

13:11.670 --> 13:15.573
Bad weather can become a
matter of national security.

13:15.574 --> 13:16.941
Right.

13:16.942 --> 13:19.911
But when you have a company

13:19.912 --> 13:22.080
with a no-bid contract
for military bases,

13:22.081 --> 13:24.782
you can't exactly consider
it bad weather, right?

13:24.783 --> 13:27.485
- (laughs)
- (Jackson clears throat)

13:27.486 --> 13:29.420
Speaking of nature,
I hear you're a birder.

13:29.421 --> 13:30.421
Tell me about that.

13:30.422 --> 13:32.423
(chuckling): Well...

13:32.424 --> 13:34.359
It started in college...

13:34.360 --> 13:35.660
Hello, Henry.

13:35.661 --> 13:37.662
Conrad. Good to see you.

13:37.663 --> 13:39.864
Lydia's hoping to carve
out a moment with you.

13:39.865 --> 13:42.300
First spouse to second
spouse kind of thing.

13:42.301 --> 13:43.434
I'll give you a heads-up

13:43.435 --> 13:45.737
about the relentless
scrutiny headed your way.

13:45.738 --> 13:46.905
Don't let it scare you.

13:46.906 --> 13:48.606
I think I can handle it.

13:48.607 --> 13:50.675
The husband of the
vice president isn't exactly

13:50.676 --> 13:52.443
a high-profile element of the campaign.

13:52.444 --> 13:55.280
You'd be surprised.
You test pretty well.

13:55.281 --> 13:58.016
I'm afraid they're gonna try
you out in front of the cameras

13:58.017 --> 13:59.684
any chance they get.

13:59.685 --> 14:01.920
I hope you don't have
any pie in the sky plans

14:01.921 --> 14:03.353
for a life of your own.

14:04.822 --> 14:08.092
Made one tiny little joke

14:08.093 --> 14:09.661
which he totally had coming,

14:09.662 --> 14:12.897
and Russell acted like
I barfed on the guy.

14:12.898 --> 14:14.566
He probably would've preferred that.

14:14.567 --> 14:16.434
(sighs) What if I can't do this?

14:16.435 --> 14:18.269
You can do it.

14:18.270 --> 14:20.605
You just got to think
of the bigger picture.

14:20.606 --> 14:24.841
Tonight was just not
a fun night. That's all.

14:26.611 --> 14:27.579
What happened?

14:27.580 --> 14:29.881
(sighs) Just...

14:29.882 --> 14:31.950
Conrad gave me a speech about

14:31.951 --> 14:34.352
when <i>they</i> campaign, <i>we</i> campaign,

14:34.353 --> 14:37.221
and so I should maybe
cut back on my work.

14:37.222 --> 14:39.023
Well, that's crazy.

14:39.024 --> 14:42.193
You... you're not even
teaching that many classes.

14:42.194 --> 14:44.662
He wasn't talking about teaching.

14:44.663 --> 14:46.930
Jose came to see me today.

14:47.665 --> 14:48.866
(sighs) They're...

14:48.867 --> 14:50.170
they're putting together another

14:50.171 --> 14:52.171
anti-terror work group.
I didn't commit.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.772
But you wanted to.

14:54.773 --> 14:56.841
And now you feel like you can't.

14:56.842 --> 14:58.810
This is crazy.

14:58.811 --> 15:01.179
We actually have jobs that
make a difference in the world

15:01.180 --> 15:03.948
and we're giving them up? For what?

15:03.949 --> 15:06.618
For county fairs and
billionaire dinners?

15:06.619 --> 15:08.152
That's just the campaign.

15:08.153 --> 15:10.355
The job is still kind of important.

15:10.356 --> 15:11.956
Do you remember what Conrad said

15:11.957 --> 15:14.060
when he first talked to you
about secretary of state?

15:14.061 --> 15:16.194
That we could effect
real change in the world.

15:16.195 --> 15:19.030
Exactly. This is an even bigger
opportunity to do that.

15:19.031 --> 15:20.831
- (sighs)
- You got to take it.

15:21.866 --> 15:22.934
ELIZABETH: <i>Good morning.</i>

15:22.935 --> 15:24.302
- Hi, Mom.
- Morning. - Hi.

15:24.303 --> 15:26.904
Sorry, my hair staged a rebellion.

15:26.905 --> 15:27.872
You look great.

15:27.873 --> 15:29.040
Totally vice presidential.

15:29.041 --> 15:30.575
- Jason.
- Jason. - I told you,

15:30.576 --> 15:34.245
that information is on
complete lockdown until July.

15:34.246 --> 15:35.647
- We're in our house.
- Still,

15:35.648 --> 15:37.704
you have to pretend like
you don't know anything.

15:37.705 --> 15:40.018
Seriously. Ignorance as a plus?
This is your moment.

15:40.019 --> 15:42.220
Really, pal. You got to
toe the line on this one.

15:42.221 --> 15:44.489
- Okay, I got it.
- STEVIE: Guys,

15:44.490 --> 15:46.658
look at the flat Jareth
found for us in Oxford

15:46.659 --> 15:48.893
on Airbnb. Isn't it amazing?

15:48.894 --> 15:51.896
You're inviting us over, right?
Summer in England?

15:51.897 --> 15:53.197
That would be so cool.

15:53.198 --> 15:55.199
Okay. My computer
is officially possessed.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.601
- It keeps crashing.
- ALISON: Maybe

15:56.602 --> 15:58.505
it's embarrassed you're
still playing <i>Minecraft.</i>

15:58.506 --> 15:59.303
(laughter)

15:59.304 --> 16:01.407
I'm trying to upload my
homework assignment.

16:01.408 --> 16:03.311
It's been acting like this
for a couple of days.

16:03.312 --> 16:04.609
Here, give it to me.

16:04.610 --> 16:07.378
I'll take it to the White House,
see if Oliver Shaw can fix it.

16:07.379 --> 16:10.002
ELIZABETH: Isn't that overkill?
Well, I've got to go there anyway.

16:10.003 --> 16:12.817
Check in with Jose, officially
turn down the consulting gig.

16:12.818 --> 16:15.219
Figure I might as well enjoy
the last of the perks.

16:15.220 --> 16:16.587
I think there might be some perks

16:16.588 --> 16:17.731
to being Mr. Vice President.

16:17.732 --> 16:19.490
- ALL: Jason!
- I'm sorry!

16:19.491 --> 16:21.325
♪

16:21.326 --> 16:23.728
The guy at DoD gave me
a not-so-subtle prompt

16:23.729 --> 16:25.697
to go digging for internal reports.

16:25.698 --> 16:28.499
Turns out there were several
over the last decade

16:28.500 --> 16:31.502
about rising sea levels and
extreme weather patterns.

16:31.503 --> 16:34.138
That's not exactly breaking news, Jay.

16:34.139 --> 16:38.342
As well as several proposals to
raise all naval bases to prepare,

16:38.343 --> 16:40.311
something Burton Standard
Enterprises knew

16:40.312 --> 16:42.814
when they refurbished the
Bahraini base two years ago.

16:42.815 --> 16:44.682
Okay, that's different.

16:44.683 --> 16:46.350
They ignored the proposal. Why?

16:46.351 --> 16:48.986
Because according to Congress,
sea levels aren't rising.

16:48.987 --> 16:51.189
And if we did raise the bases,

16:51.190 --> 16:55.793
that would trigger an entirely
new agreement negotiation.

16:55.794 --> 16:58.262
And guys like Julius Burton

16:58.263 --> 17:00.732
would probably lose
their no-bid contracts.

17:00.733 --> 17:03.267
All along DoD has been
clear that climate change

17:03.268 --> 17:05.491
is one of the biggest looming
threats to forces overseas

17:05.492 --> 17:09.307
because they actually
have to prepare for reality.

17:09.308 --> 17:11.771
But the party's deluded stance
on the issue has prevented them

17:11.771 --> 17:13.176
from doing anything about it.

17:13.178 --> 17:16.748
(sighs) Just... I'm sorry.
Just venting.

17:16.749 --> 17:19.250
I know there's nothing we can do.

17:19.251 --> 17:22.385
That's what they always say.

17:24.422 --> 17:26.790
Until somebody does.

17:26.791 --> 17:28.659
What day is it?

17:28.660 --> 17:30.695
Wednesday?

17:30.696 --> 17:33.330
Let's change the world.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.428
(typing) Oh, this is not good.

17:41.429 --> 17:44.231
- What?
- Someone's hacked into the webcam.

17:44.232 --> 17:46.366
Looks like they've been
turning it on and watching

17:46.367 --> 17:48.030
every time he's connected
to the Internet.

17:48.031 --> 17:50.437
- How... can that happen?
- It could be a

17:50.438 --> 17:53.507
piece of Trojan software buried
in a game he downloaded.

17:53.508 --> 17:55.842
Some computer-savvy creep at school

17:55.843 --> 17:59.212
could have uploaded it
without his knowing. Or...

17:59.213 --> 18:01.148
it could be something else.

18:01.149 --> 18:02.783
And given who Jason's parents are,

18:02.784 --> 18:05.986
the security implications
could be larger.

18:05.987 --> 18:07.621
Right.

18:07.622 --> 18:10.424
You should take this to the
FBI for further examination.

18:10.425 --> 18:12.225
Just to be safe.

18:12.226 --> 18:14.161
Okay. Yeah.

18:14.162 --> 18:17.497
Uh... Thanks, Oliver.

18:17.498 --> 18:19.199
JACKSON: <i>Did you know</i>

18:19.200 --> 18:21.401
that sugar subsidies totaled

18:21.402 --> 18:24.905
over $258 million in the last year?

18:24.906 --> 18:26.773
Imagine how many soldiers

18:26.774 --> 18:28.942
we can put in body
armor with that money.

18:28.943 --> 18:32.913
If we want to unleash the free
market and keep America safe,

18:32.914 --> 18:36.669
we can't afford four more
years of frivolous handouts.

18:36.670 --> 18:40.087
Frivolous? Governor, I'll tell you
what's frivolous: a politician

18:40.088 --> 18:42.289
who talks a big game about
supporting the military

18:42.290 --> 18:45.292
and then criticizes the very
policies that keep us safe.

18:45.293 --> 18:46.276
JESSICA: I wouldn't jump

18:46.277 --> 18:47.661
on the word "frivolous."

18:47.662 --> 18:49.629
It makes you sound...

18:49.630 --> 18:51.364
Frivolous?

18:51.365 --> 18:52.966
But he started it.

18:52.967 --> 18:55.602
- (laughter)
- ELIZABETH: Sorry to interrupt.

18:55.603 --> 18:57.671
Sir, we need to talk.
How are you, Russell?

18:57.672 --> 19:00.207
- I am very Sam Evans.
- That can't be fun.

19:00.208 --> 19:03.176
- Take a seat. I could use a break.
- I need to know why,

19:03.177 --> 19:05.378
when every respected climate scientist

19:05.379 --> 19:08.115
in the country had warned
that the Bahraini base

19:08.116 --> 19:09.816
was subject to damage from cyclones,

19:09.817 --> 19:13.186
Burton Standard Enterprises did
nothing to address the problem

19:13.187 --> 19:15.122
when it refurbished the
base just two years ago?

19:15.123 --> 19:16.823
Okay.

19:16.824 --> 19:19.291
Can we have the room?

19:20.360 --> 19:22.394
- I'm s... sorry. I thought...
- Ah.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.165
I thought that they should hear it.

19:27.968 --> 19:30.237
You thought the campaign team

19:30.238 --> 19:33.006
should hear you lighting
into the business practices

19:33.007 --> 19:34.808
of one of the president's
biggest donors?

19:34.809 --> 19:36.109
Much bigger than that.

19:36.110 --> 19:37.377
What?

19:37.378 --> 19:38.612
It's not just the denial

19:38.613 --> 19:40.947
of climate change
that's holding us back,

19:40.948 --> 19:43.350
even the location of the base
is further evidence that

19:43.351 --> 19:45.685
we're stuck in old thinking.

19:45.686 --> 19:48.955
Why are we still in Bahrain at all?

19:48.956 --> 19:50.757
Why should the U.S.

19:50.758 --> 19:53.927
spend its blood and treasure
in the Persian Gulf,

19:53.928 --> 19:57.864
aiding and defending states with
atrocious human rights records,

19:57.865 --> 20:02.202
while countries like Tunisia...
who actually share our values...

20:02.203 --> 20:03.603
go unaided?

20:03.604 --> 20:06.439
As poetic as that sounds, Bess,

20:06.440 --> 20:08.308
that's a pretty simplified take on

20:08.309 --> 20:10.143
one of the world's most
complicated regions.

20:10.144 --> 20:11.945
There's this new thing called terrorism.

20:11.946 --> 20:13.213
It's really catching on.

20:13.214 --> 20:17.050
Bahrain has nothing to do with
our strategy to fight terrorism.

20:17.051 --> 20:19.553
And we need to be honest with ourselves

20:19.554 --> 20:22.255
about the real challenges we face,

20:22.256 --> 20:25.325
or we are going to face a future

20:25.326 --> 20:29.796
with more and more American
lives sacrificed, and for what?

20:29.797 --> 20:32.833
Preserving the power of
people like Julius Burton?

20:32.834 --> 20:34.901
I mean, exactly when
did the United States

20:34.902 --> 20:37.604
start making every decision based on

20:37.605 --> 20:40.407
strategic and politically
expedient reasons?

20:40.408 --> 20:42.843
If we partner with nations

20:42.844 --> 20:45.812
just to remain dominant
on the world stage,

20:45.813 --> 20:48.415
how are we any less imperialistic

20:48.416 --> 20:49.816
than Russia or China?

20:49.817 --> 20:52.018
I think we are at a

20:52.019 --> 20:54.354
critical juncture in human history

20:54.355 --> 20:57.524
and the U.S. needs
to completely overhaul

20:57.525 --> 21:00.327
its relationship with the
international community.

21:00.328 --> 21:03.296
How could you seriously
suggest a complete change

21:03.297 --> 21:06.333
of U.S. foreign policy
during an election

21:06.334 --> 21:07.567
which I am barely winning?

21:07.568 --> 21:09.202
I'm already backed against the wall

21:09.203 --> 21:11.638
for allowing a dirty
bomb attack on my watch,

21:11.639 --> 21:14.040
not to mention trading a
treacherous spy to the Russians

21:14.041 --> 21:17.210
for reasons that I can't disclose.

21:17.211 --> 21:20.080
And now you expect me to
explain to the American people

21:20.081 --> 21:22.315
that I'm going to pull stakes on

21:22.316 --> 21:24.784
a major strategic position
in the Middle East?

21:24.785 --> 21:28.287
And totally alienate my
biggest donor in the process?

21:30.457 --> 21:32.392
What good is bold idealism

21:32.393 --> 21:35.061
if it all but guarantees
the loss of a second term?

21:35.062 --> 21:38.398
I'm talking about doing what's right.

21:38.399 --> 21:40.899
And I'm talking about winning.

21:42.432 --> 21:44.029
HENRY: <i>You're not gonna get fired.</i>

21:44.030 --> 21:46.453
Because that would be a crazy
thing to do during an election,

21:46.454 --> 21:48.408
because you're too valuable.

21:48.409 --> 21:50.477
Should've said that one first.

21:50.478 --> 21:52.479
I'm sure he's rethinking
the VP position.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.314
And I can't really blame him.

21:54.315 --> 21:56.116
Don't worry about it. I'm sure that

21:56.117 --> 21:58.084
Conrad appreciates your passion.

21:58.085 --> 21:59.519
Okay, let's go with that one.

21:59.520 --> 22:02.088
How's your day? Did you get

22:02.089 --> 22:03.290
Jason's computer fixed?

22:03.291 --> 22:05.659
Well, I'm afraid that's more bad news.

22:05.660 --> 22:07.027
It got hacked somehow.

22:07.028 --> 22:08.771
It's probably just some
kids fooling around,

22:08.772 --> 22:10.397
but I'm taking it to the FBI

22:10.398 --> 22:12.132
to make sure it's not a
more serious breach.

22:12.133 --> 22:12.841
Really?

22:12.842 --> 22:15.265
Yeah, it's probably that kid
George from his chemistry class.

22:15.266 --> 22:16.569
You know, the troll?

22:16.570 --> 22:18.738
- That's not nice.
- No, no. He's a troller.

22:18.739 --> 22:19.906
He trolls.

22:19.907 --> 22:21.875
Uh, he hacked a
cheerleader's Tumblr account.

22:21.876 --> 22:23.810
Well...

22:23.811 --> 22:25.979
(grunting)

22:25.980 --> 22:28.480
(tires screech)

22:30.650 --> 22:32.552
Henry, are you there?

22:32.553 --> 22:34.853
Henry?

22:39.075 --> 22:41.444
- Guys, we're home.
- Hey.

22:41.445 --> 22:43.546
- Are you okay?
- Yes, please, no fussing.

22:43.547 --> 22:44.814
- Dad!
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

22:44.815 --> 22:47.160
Dad, you were mugged. It's a big deal.

22:47.161 --> 22:48.624
Oh, come on, he was in Desert Storm.

22:48.625 --> 22:49.663
He's probably fine.

22:49.664 --> 22:50.931
Plenty of people survive
war and then get killed

22:50.932 --> 22:52.232
in stupid acts of gun violence.

22:52.233 --> 22:54.201
There was no gun.
This was bat violence.

22:54.202 --> 22:55.502
ALISON: Did you break anything?

22:55.503 --> 22:56.970
I cracked two ribs, but they're two

22:56.971 --> 22:58.434
I don't use very often, so I'm fine.

22:58.435 --> 23:00.040
Okay, grab a seat, Captain Stoical.

23:00.041 --> 23:02.876
Jace, I'm sorry,
but they got your computer.

23:02.877 --> 23:04.578
JASON: It's jacked-up anyway.

23:04.579 --> 23:05.545
I'm psyched for the upgrade.

23:05.546 --> 23:07.013
Okay, look, why don't you guys go in

23:07.014 --> 23:09.335
and make some dinner and Dad
will limp in in a few minutes.

23:09.336 --> 23:10.436
Yeah, okay, come on, guys.

23:10.437 --> 23:11.284
Operation Tacos?

23:11.285 --> 23:12.252
No, grilled cheese.

23:12.253 --> 23:14.120
No, ramen. It never lets you down.

23:14.121 --> 23:16.623
So, no other news from the FBI?

23:16.624 --> 23:18.558
No, the plates were untraceable.

23:18.559 --> 23:20.327
They said we shouldn't
jump to conclusions.

23:20.328 --> 23:21.861
Like it was a concerted,

23:21.862 --> 23:23.830
organized effort to get the computer?

23:23.831 --> 23:25.332
Yeah, like that.

23:25.333 --> 23:27.500
Anyway,

23:27.501 --> 23:29.084
they're handling it now.
We shouldn't worry about it.

23:29.085 --> 23:30.637
Great, I feel completely relaxed.

23:30.638 --> 23:32.706
And I've got this Jane
Pauley interview.

23:32.707 --> 23:34.207
Do you want me to cancel?

23:34.208 --> 23:35.542
No, of course not.

23:35.543 --> 23:37.573
We've got plenty of time
to stress about this.

23:37.574 --> 23:38.517
Plus, if you stay here,

23:38.518 --> 23:40.413
you'll have to eat grilled
cheese ramen tacos.

23:40.414 --> 23:41.917
- Go, save yourself.
- (laughs): Okay.

23:41.918 --> 23:44.285
- Bye.
- Bye.

23:45.352 --> 23:46.586
So, Madam Secretary,

23:46.587 --> 23:50.509
with the presidential primary
debate only moments away,

23:50.510 --> 23:53.646
it's a good time to address
the elephant in the room.

23:53.647 --> 23:56.682
If President Dalton
secures the nomination,

23:56.683 --> 24:00.519
do you expect to be offered
the position of vice president?

24:00.520 --> 24:02.555
And will you accept?

24:02.556 --> 24:05.057
Well, I am unfamiliar

24:05.058 --> 24:07.426
with that elephant.

24:07.427 --> 24:10.029
Well, you can't be unfamiliar,
with the speculation

24:10.030 --> 24:14.433
that Vice President Delgado
having health problems, that

24:14.434 --> 24:15.937
you are the most obvious replacement.

24:15.938 --> 24:19.338
Look, uh, the president still
has the nomination to win

24:19.339 --> 24:24.377
and I, I am, well, I have my
hands full with my day job.

24:24.378 --> 24:26.078
Speaking of that,

24:26.079 --> 24:28.914
the recent superstorm
that severely damaged

24:28.915 --> 24:31.917
a U.S. naval base in Bahrain

24:31.918 --> 24:34.687
could bring up the ongoing question

24:34.688 --> 24:36.355
of climate change.

24:36.356 --> 24:37.890
This is the third

24:37.891 --> 24:40.593
or fourth storm of the century

24:40.594 --> 24:42.361
in the last decade.

24:42.362 --> 24:45.331
So it's beginning to look
less like a freak of nature

24:45.332 --> 24:48.267
than maybe a pattern of nature.

24:48.268 --> 24:51.037
It's very difficult to say

24:51.038 --> 24:55.007
that one storm is irrefutable evidence

24:55.008 --> 24:57.276
of changing weather patterns...

24:57.277 --> 24:59.445
I understand that, but
do you, Madam Secretary,

24:59.446 --> 25:03.448
believe that climate change is real?

25:05.317 --> 25:09.287
It's not a matter of belief.

25:10.823 --> 25:14.760
Based on the consensus
in the scientific community,

25:14.761 --> 25:17.430
I am convinced it's a significant issue

25:17.431 --> 25:19.365
that needs to be addressed.

25:19.366 --> 25:22.301
Are you breaking rank
with the president

25:22.302 --> 25:24.270
and the party on this?

25:24.271 --> 25:26.572
Well, I-I've never

25:26.573 --> 25:29.575
been an official member
of any political party.

25:29.576 --> 25:31.811
I'm not a partisan politician.

25:31.812 --> 25:33.879
I'm a public servant.

25:33.880 --> 25:37.817
That is an excellent clarification.

25:37.818 --> 25:39.485
JAY: <i>Madam Secretary?</i>

25:39.486 --> 25:41.520
Hey, Jay.

25:41.521 --> 25:43.521
You're starting to look at
home in the White House.

25:43.522 --> 25:45.225
You ready for some
varsity debate analysis?

25:45.226 --> 25:47.093
Yes, ma'am, but first I have to say

25:47.094 --> 25:49.228
I'm pleasantly taken
aback and full of awe

25:49.229 --> 25:50.629
and admiration

25:50.630 --> 25:52.998
and that I have your back
no matter how this turns out.

25:52.999 --> 25:54.266
Great.

25:54.267 --> 25:55.810
(whispers): What are we talking about?

25:55.811 --> 25:57.803
Your performance on the show just now.

25:57.804 --> 25:59.939
Oh, the VP thing?

25:59.940 --> 26:01.240
I felt I skirted that.

26:01.241 --> 26:02.608
No, no, climate change.

26:02.609 --> 26:04.276
Oh, come on, that was just chatter.

26:04.277 --> 26:06.912
Bono was on afterwards
to discuss his endorsement.

26:06.913 --> 26:08.080
People were just...

26:08.081 --> 26:09.615
Are you completely insane?!

26:09.616 --> 26:12.451
Well, the test results aren't back yet,

26:12.452 --> 26:14.220
- but...
- You think this is funny?

26:14.221 --> 26:17.690
You have created a
firestorm inside the party.

26:17.691 --> 26:19.058
Social media's blowing up.

26:19.059 --> 26:20.459
It's gonna lead every news...

26:20.460 --> 26:22.495
It was a personal question.

26:22.496 --> 26:24.530
And I'm not gonna lie
on national television.

26:24.531 --> 26:26.332
The president understands

26:26.333 --> 26:29.268
the difference between personal
honesty and party politics.

26:29.269 --> 26:32.505
The president understands
there's an election to win.

26:32.506 --> 26:34.206
And if you care at all about him,

26:34.207 --> 26:36.709
or advancing your own agenda,

26:36.710 --> 26:39.378
you'll keep your mouth
shut about climate change

26:39.379 --> 26:41.313
till the end of time.

26:41.314 --> 26:43.949
Which may come sooner than you think.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.813
You'd better hope it does.
Where are you going?

26:45.814 --> 26:46.919
I've changed my mind.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.920
I'm gonna watch the debate at home.

26:50.756 --> 26:52.558
He's in V-fib.

26:52.559 --> 26:53.559
Start compressions.

26:53.560 --> 26:54.983
DOCTOR: Epinephrine, one milligram.

26:54.984 --> 26:56.662
Get me the AED.

26:56.663 --> 26:58.730
- Clear.
- Clear.

26:58.998 --> 27:00.232
Recharge?

27:00.233 --> 27:01.233
Stand back.

27:01.234 --> 27:03.435
DOCTOR: Clear!

27:03.436 --> 27:04.904
You're ready, Mr. President.

27:04.905 --> 27:07.205
(phone buzzes)

27:08.574 --> 27:09.708
Hello.

27:09.709 --> 27:11.043
We just got word.

27:11.044 --> 27:12.978
Ensign Kelley didn't make it.

27:12.979 --> 27:15.681
News is gonna break shortly.

27:15.682 --> 27:17.316
It could come up in the debate.

27:17.317 --> 27:18.984
I understand.

27:18.985 --> 27:21.220
I'd like you to connect
me to the family.

27:21.221 --> 27:23.355
Right now, sir?

27:23.356 --> 27:24.590
Yes, now.

27:24.591 --> 27:26.959
I'd like a moment, please.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.127
It's fine.

27:28.128 --> 27:29.861
I'll see you out there.

27:32.798 --> 27:34.900
Mr. and Mrs. Kelley?

27:34.901 --> 27:38.604
I want to tell you how
sorry I am for your loss

27:38.605 --> 27:40.739
and to thank you for
the enormous sacrifice

27:40.740 --> 27:44.677
that Sean made for his country
and his fellow crewmen.

27:44.678 --> 27:46.345
I understand he held onto that cable

27:46.346 --> 27:49.949
until every sailor had
made it to safety.

27:49.950 --> 27:53.452
All of those men and their
families are in his debt.

27:53.453 --> 27:55.720
God be with you.

27:58.490 --> 27:59.992
EVANS: <i>Every moment</i>

27:59.993 --> 28:03.229
of this presidency has been a failure

28:03.230 --> 28:05.865
born of incompetency and cowardice.

28:05.866 --> 28:08.133
A dirty bomb attack on American soil.

28:08.134 --> 28:10.669
A gutless, lenient
peace deal with Iran.

28:10.670 --> 28:12.771
Appeasement of Russia
with the shameful trade

28:12.772 --> 28:15.207
of the notorious spy Peter Buckley.

28:15.208 --> 28:19.345
It reveals a president
catastrophically soft on defense

28:19.346 --> 28:21.513
and unsupportive of
the American military.

28:21.514 --> 28:24.583
(applause)

28:24.584 --> 28:28.220
Now...

28:28.221 --> 28:30.689
now we hear a base in Bahrain

28:30.690 --> 28:33.453
has been destroyed by cyclone
winds, and just moments ago,

28:33.454 --> 28:35.822
we learned that Ensign Sean Kelley,

28:35.823 --> 28:38.825
after remaining in a coma
for several days, has died.

28:38.826 --> 28:41.261
Ladies and gentlemen,
even in peacetime,

28:41.262 --> 28:43.430
Dalton cannot seem to protect

28:43.431 --> 28:47.067
our men and women in uniform.

28:47.068 --> 28:50.269
President Dalton, your response?

28:56.176 --> 28:58.478
Ensign Sean Kelley's death

28:58.479 --> 29:02.582
was not caused by so-called
"soft support of the military,"

29:02.583 --> 29:05.986
but because of a willful
denial of reality

29:05.987 --> 29:07.788
by many in Washington

29:07.789 --> 29:09.323
and in my own party,

29:09.324 --> 29:11.725
including Governor Evans.

29:11.726 --> 29:13.627
(scoffs)

29:13.628 --> 29:15.228
And that reality is climate change.

29:15.229 --> 29:17.230
The extreme weather patterns

29:17.231 --> 29:19.333
and rising sea levels around the world.

29:19.334 --> 29:21.835
Because we remain in denial about that,

29:21.836 --> 29:24.905
our naval bases around
the globe remain unsafe,

29:24.906 --> 29:26.373
and our military men and women

29:26.374 --> 29:30.177
who occupy them remain
at unnecessary risk.

29:30.178 --> 29:32.646
This scientifically proven reality

29:32.647 --> 29:35.549
will continue to be a grave threat

29:35.550 --> 29:38.885
to both military and civilian
populations everywhere

29:38.886 --> 29:42.222
until we take serious and
specific action to address it.

29:42.223 --> 29:43.457
And why don't we?

29:43.458 --> 29:46.760
Because this reality doesn't serve us.

29:46.761 --> 29:49.463
It doesn't serve the false
construct of foreign policy.

29:49.464 --> 29:51.798
It keeps us beholden to
nations who have resources

29:51.799 --> 29:53.734
we think we need.

29:53.735 --> 29:56.203
Instead of committing
ourselves to nations

29:56.204 --> 29:59.239
who espouse and live and
breathe the values we share.

29:59.240 --> 30:02.309
The values of freedom and democracy

30:02.310 --> 30:04.044
and basic human rights.

30:04.045 --> 30:05.712
Economic and political gamesmanship

30:05.713 --> 30:09.616
makes us no better than the
imperial countries we censure.

30:09.617 --> 30:11.918
We need to lead by example.

30:11.919 --> 30:13.954
If elected to a second term,

30:13.955 --> 30:17.324
I vow to prepare the United
States for a changing world.

30:17.325 --> 30:20.594
Changing rapidly due
to a warming climate

30:20.595 --> 30:22.496
and shifting global allegiances.

30:22.497 --> 30:24.731
I will do this against all opposition,

30:24.732 --> 30:26.600
including inside my own party.

30:26.601 --> 30:29.369
Because as President
Lyndon Johnson said

30:29.370 --> 30:32.005
when he signed the Civil
Rights Act of 1964,

30:32.006 --> 30:35.142
risking his party's political
future to do the right thing,

30:35.143 --> 30:38.345
"What the hell's the presidency for?"

30:38.346 --> 30:40.713
(applause and clamoring)

30:44.451 --> 30:46.785
Looks like he forgives you.

30:48.755 --> 30:51.257
What the hell has he done?

30:56.640 --> 30:59.273
I think this is premature.
Let us sit down with you.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.724
I'm-I'm with the president now.

31:00.725 --> 31:03.426
We could be there in half an hour.

31:04.562 --> 31:06.897
I think you're making
a serious mistake.

31:06.898 --> 31:09.166
And I think you need to... (stammers)

31:09.167 --> 31:10.668
(sighs)

31:10.669 --> 31:12.837
Well, that didn't take long.

31:12.838 --> 31:14.939
Julius Burton is officially throwing

31:14.940 --> 31:17.475
all his financial support to Sam Evans.

31:17.476 --> 31:18.939
I'm tired of worrying about what men

31:18.940 --> 31:20.244
like Burton do with their money.

31:20.245 --> 31:21.312
I'm not going to renew

31:21.313 --> 31:23.347
the Defense Cooperation
Agreement with Bahrain.

31:23.348 --> 31:24.771
Instead, we're going to move toward

31:24.772 --> 31:26.217
building a new base in Tunisia.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.361
We're going to bring our
military and economic support

31:28.362 --> 31:29.820
to a country that has earned it.

31:29.821 --> 31:31.222
What about the next administration?

31:31.223 --> 31:32.323
What happens when all this

31:32.324 --> 31:35.259
executive action is
rolled back in January?

31:35.260 --> 31:38.229
Already writing a
presidential obituary?

31:38.230 --> 31:40.731
No, sir.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.899
You did that yourself.

31:47.138 --> 31:49.573
WOMAN: <i>So it's official,
President Conrad Dalton</i>

31:49.574 --> 31:51.742
will be a one-term president.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.078
Governor Sam Evans just won the primary

31:54.079 --> 31:56.347
and will head to the general election.

31:56.348 --> 31:59.049
So, is this the first time
that an incumbent president

31:59.050 --> 32:01.118
has failed to get his
party's nomination?

32:01.119 --> 32:04.822
MAN: Actually, no, in 1856,
Franklin Pierce failed to secure

32:04.823 --> 32:07.358
his party's support,
but it is only the second time,

32:07.359 --> 32:09.894
which makes it pretty historic.

32:09.895 --> 32:12.463
WOMAN: We'll be right back
with more election coverage.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.698
Sorry, Mr. President.

32:14.699 --> 32:18.469
Uh, there are some things
that we have to address.

32:18.470 --> 32:22.139
You, uh, you need to

32:22.140 --> 32:24.708
concede the nomination to Evans

32:24.709 --> 32:27.678
and assure him that you'll
toe the party line,

32:27.679 --> 32:30.748
endorse his candidacy, and help him out

32:30.749 --> 32:33.150
on the campaign trail

32:33.151 --> 32:34.718
as much as you can, though...

32:34.719 --> 32:35.659
Though right now

32:35.660 --> 32:38.162
I'm such a liability that my services

32:38.163 --> 32:40.297
might not be very much in demand.

32:40.298 --> 32:42.933
You could look at that as an upside.

32:42.934 --> 32:44.969
Yes, I think I will.

32:44.970 --> 32:48.305
- Mr. President, I'm so sorry.
- No, Bess.

32:48.306 --> 32:50.741
We're not going to
assign any blame here.

32:50.742 --> 32:52.743
We all made our choices,

32:52.744 --> 32:55.112
we did our best.

32:55.113 --> 32:56.413
Although I do wish I'd been able

32:56.414 --> 32:58.649
to announce your candidacy
for vice president.

32:58.650 --> 33:00.651
I appreciate your faith in me.

33:00.652 --> 33:03.354
Sir, you still have
seven months in office

33:03.355 --> 33:05.222
and there's work to be done.

33:05.223 --> 33:07.992
I suggest we all just...

33:07.993 --> 33:09.593
focus on that.

33:09.594 --> 33:11.194
That's right.

33:12.062 --> 33:13.998
A great team.

33:13.999 --> 33:16.499
I've been privileged to have you.

33:29.547 --> 33:32.181
I'm sorry. It's just wrong.

33:34.885 --> 33:37.888
Well, the good news is...

33:37.889 --> 33:40.691
that you can go back to
your intelligence work.

33:40.692 --> 33:44.562
Maybe I'll go visit Stevie
in Oxford this summer.

33:44.563 --> 33:46.497
Go back to teaching.

33:46.498 --> 33:48.831
We don't have to figure
this all out tonight.

33:50.768 --> 33:54.471
I really wanted a shot at that
vice presidency, I'll admit it.

33:54.472 --> 33:57.174
But mainly I just wanted Conrad

33:57.175 --> 33:59.710
to have another term. He deserved it.

33:59.711 --> 34:01.577
You both did.

34:10.621 --> 34:12.690
- (indistinct conversations)
- Excuse me.

34:12.690 --> 34:14.991
You guys want a cup of water?

34:16.694 --> 34:18.161
Madam Secretary.

34:18.163 --> 34:20.431
Chief Justice, hi.

34:20.431 --> 34:21.931
Tough loss.

34:21.933 --> 34:23.333
I'm sorry.

34:23.335 --> 34:24.501
Thank you.

34:24.502 --> 34:26.170
And you would have made a great

34:26.170 --> 34:27.905
vice president, too.

34:27.906 --> 34:29.639
I would have voted for that ticket.

34:29.641 --> 34:30.908
And it's not even my party.

34:30.909 --> 34:32.909
Thank you, sir.

34:32.911 --> 34:35.277
(whispers): Don... Don't tell anyone.

34:41.255 --> 34:43.353
According to the new
Defense Cooperation Agreement,

34:43.355 --> 34:45.054
the construction on the naval base

34:45.056 --> 34:47.391
will employ Tunisian
contractors and workers,

34:47.391 --> 34:51.195
which will bring a
boost to your economy.

34:51.196 --> 34:52.563
We look forward

34:52.563 --> 34:55.366
to establishing a strong
partnership with your country.

34:55.367 --> 34:56.967
MOSSADEK: As do we, I assure you.

34:56.967 --> 35:00.304
And I do appreciate,
Mr. President, Madam Secretary,

35:00.305 --> 35:02.473
the sacrifices you made on our behalf.

35:02.474 --> 35:05.242
It may be a dark moment
now, but you have

35:05.243 --> 35:07.344
moved your country toward greatness.

35:07.345 --> 35:08.312
People don't always

35:08.313 --> 35:10.080
thank you for that, but your legacy

35:10.081 --> 35:12.515
will reflect it.

35:14.785 --> 35:16.420
Thank you, Foreign Minister.

35:16.421 --> 35:18.355
I'm proud that we could
accomplish this together.

35:18.356 --> 35:20.891
Believe me, I know only too well

35:20.892 --> 35:24.694
the perils of leading a
country into a new direction.

35:26.730 --> 35:29.665
Have a good trip back.

35:35.072 --> 35:37.775
Well, that's ironic.

35:37.776 --> 35:40.244
Being given advice on the
pitfalls of democracy

35:40.245 --> 35:42.579
by one of the most
nascent in the world.

35:42.580 --> 35:45.649
Russell and I'll be
working on strategies

35:45.650 --> 35:47.985
to ensure against the
next administration

35:47.986 --> 35:50.721
being able to undo this negotiation.

35:50.722 --> 35:54.058
Yes. Fred Reynold's
plan is to slash defense

35:54.059 --> 35:56.393
back to bows and arrows.

35:56.394 --> 35:57.962
Either way...

35:57.963 --> 35:59.563
this agreement is at risk.

35:59.564 --> 36:03.133
Sam Evans is on his way over
to talk about my endorsement.

36:03.134 --> 36:06.437
Turns out that while I'm
kryptonite to much of the base,

36:06.438 --> 36:08.539
among moderates and
independent swing voters,

36:08.540 --> 36:10.607
and, his words...

36:10.608 --> 36:12.643
"other coveted demographics"...

36:12.644 --> 36:14.712
- I'm still popular.
- Well, I guess that's

36:14.713 --> 36:16.547
the domestic politics version

36:16.548 --> 36:19.717
of "you're big in Japan."

36:19.718 --> 36:21.552
(short chuckle)
Better to be a lame duck

36:21.553 --> 36:23.787
than a dead duck, I suppose.

36:23.788 --> 36:25.588
Thanks, Bess.

36:34.131 --> 36:36.432
(indistinct conversation)

36:39.336 --> 36:41.305
Madam Secretary, good to see you.

36:41.306 --> 36:43.040
- Governor Evans.
- I just ran into

36:43.041 --> 36:44.742
Foreign Minister
Mossadek on the way out.

36:44.743 --> 36:46.844
I guess he was here
to discuss a naval base

36:46.845 --> 36:48.345
- you promised him over...
- We've already secured the agreement.

36:48.346 --> 36:50.947
Which I will do everything
in my power to undo.

36:52.149 --> 36:54.318
I'll let you go.
The president's waiting.

36:54.319 --> 36:56.020
Elizabeth.

36:56.021 --> 36:57.388
We're under a lot of pressure

36:57.389 --> 36:59.165
from a number of
different organizations

36:59.166 --> 37:00.933
and constituencies,
and though I'm proud

37:00.934 --> 37:02.917
of achieving the nomination,
I'm sure you're aware

37:02.918 --> 37:05.971
that some damage has been
done to party unity.

37:05.972 --> 37:08.240
Conrad's endorsement will
go a long way to fix that,

37:08.241 --> 37:11.343
but administrative continuity
from one term to the next

37:11.344 --> 37:12.878
will help even more.

37:12.879 --> 37:15.815
So I hope that you will consider

37:15.816 --> 37:18.117
maintaining your role
as secretary of state

37:18.118 --> 37:20.519
in my cabinet.

37:20.520 --> 37:23.489
I'm asking Russell
Jackson to stay, too.

37:23.490 --> 37:25.958
I know you can't answer now.

37:25.959 --> 37:29.962
But think about it and call me
back when you come round, okay?

37:29.963 --> 37:33.165
I-I just realized that I...

37:33.166 --> 37:34.400
(stammers)

37:34.401 --> 37:35.801
I left my pen, and I'm...

37:35.802 --> 37:37.937
It's a sentimental thing,
my husband gave it to me.

37:37.938 --> 37:40.239
I'm just gonna run back
and get it. You don't mind,

37:40.240 --> 37:42.507
do you?

37:43.876 --> 37:45.344
Bess?

37:45.345 --> 37:47.446
Don't endorse Evans.

37:47.447 --> 37:48.781
Run as an independent.

37:48.782 --> 37:51.317
- What?
- You just said

37:51.318 --> 37:53.552
that you are an asset
in the general election

37:53.553 --> 37:54.787
with broad popular support.

37:54.788 --> 37:56.755
And it must be even
broader than we think,

37:56.756 --> 37:58.390
or Evans wouldn't be
hitting it so hard.

37:58.391 --> 38:00.626
What if you have a shot, even without

38:00.627 --> 38:02.628
your party's support?

38:02.629 --> 38:06.165
The move would be
historically unprecedented,

38:06.166 --> 38:08.434
but given the coup that
they just pulled on you,

38:08.435 --> 38:11.470
one unprecedented event
deserves another.

38:11.471 --> 38:13.973
Well, it's either that
or leave the country

38:13.974 --> 38:16.842
in the hands of Evans,
a spineless puppet

38:16.843 --> 38:19.411
for special interests,
or to Fred Reynolds

38:19.412 --> 38:22.781
in the other party...
a clueless isolationist.

38:22.782 --> 38:25.117
I realize this is a reckless play,

38:25.118 --> 38:27.620
given that no independent
has ever won the presidency,

38:27.621 --> 38:29.889
although Teddy Roosevelt came close,

38:29.890 --> 38:31.423
but that was...

38:31.424 --> 38:33.259
With the right support

38:33.260 --> 38:35.828
and an aggressive enough ground game,

38:35.829 --> 38:37.897
we have a fighting chance,

38:37.898 --> 38:39.532
and wouldn't you rather

38:39.533 --> 38:41.567
go out fighting?

38:41.568 --> 38:44.336
If we're gonna make history,

38:44.337 --> 38:47.305
let's make the good kind.

38:52.806 --> 38:55.074
(doorbell rings)

38:56.810 --> 39:00.214
JACKSON: You're killing me.
You know that, right?

39:00.754 --> 39:01.899
Can I get you a drink?

39:01.900 --> 39:04.901
No, thanks. I pre-drank.

39:06.904 --> 39:09.941
So, I-I take it you've

39:09.942 --> 39:12.176
spoken with Conrad.

39:12.177 --> 39:14.444
Oh, what the hell? I'm not driving.

39:18.115 --> 39:21.552
Conrad running as an independent

39:21.553 --> 39:24.322
is an insane idea.

39:24.323 --> 39:26.489
Primarily 'cause he can't win.

39:27.992 --> 39:31.395
Also...

39:31.396 --> 39:34.764
because it puts me in
an impossible position.

39:35.833 --> 39:39.570
Choosing between this president

39:39.571 --> 39:43.306
and the party I have supported
since middle school.

39:45.476 --> 39:47.445
I would counter it's not the same party

39:47.446 --> 39:49.404
you've supported since middle school.

39:49.405 --> 39:51.839
Its nominee represents nothing

39:51.840 --> 39:53.541
of what you stand for,

39:53.542 --> 39:55.109
and Conrad's chances of winning

39:55.110 --> 39:56.711
are... narrow

39:56.712 --> 39:58.975
- but not impossible.
- What do you think I've been doing

39:58.976 --> 40:01.716
all night? I've run the
numbers, Elizabeth.

40:01.717 --> 40:04.919
He loses handily in nine
out of ten scenarios.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.487
So what's the tenth?

40:06.488 --> 40:08.255
Let's concentrate on that.

40:09.457 --> 40:13.060
The winning scenario...

40:13.061 --> 40:17.297
depends on one big concession.

40:20.401 --> 40:22.670
That's why I'm here.

40:22.671 --> 40:24.539
<i>With your popularity</i>

40:24.540 --> 40:27.308
among independents and moderates,

40:27.309 --> 40:29.043
you're likely to carry swing states

40:29.044 --> 40:31.512
like Florida, Ohio, Virginia.

40:31.513 --> 40:33.247
The bad news is...

40:33.248 --> 40:35.082
that's not enough to win the election.

40:35.083 --> 40:37.752
But you don't need to win.

40:37.753 --> 40:39.587
You just need not to lose.

40:39.588 --> 40:41.989
The goal is to keep any candidate

40:41.990 --> 40:44.892
from getting to the requisite
270 electoral votes.

40:44.893 --> 40:46.961
If that were to happen,

40:46.962 --> 40:49.530
the election gets thrown to
the House of Representatives.

40:49.531 --> 40:51.699
And there, you would have

40:51.700 --> 40:53.201
a very good chance of winning.

40:53.202 --> 40:56.838
The biggest barrier to stopping
Evans from getting to 270

40:56.839 --> 40:58.906
is his home state of Pennsylvania

40:58.907 --> 41:00.708
and its 20 electoral votes.

41:00.709 --> 41:02.810
And how do we pull that off?

41:02.811 --> 41:04.078
Well, sir,

41:04.079 --> 41:06.214
there's really only one way.

41:06.215 --> 41:08.316
You need a popular
Pennsylvanian on the ticket.

41:08.317 --> 41:11.085
Senator Teresa Hurst pulls

41:11.086 --> 41:13.721
big numbers there.
She's fiercely independent,

41:13.722 --> 41:17.558
she's a shameless supporter of yours.

41:17.559 --> 41:18.993
You need to choose her

41:18.994 --> 41:20.577
to be your vice presidential candidate.

41:20.578 --> 41:21.562
No.

41:21.563 --> 41:22.897
I chose you

41:22.898 --> 41:24.899
as a trusted confidant

41:24.900 --> 41:27.335
and the exact right person for the job.

41:27.336 --> 41:29.103
Not another ticket-balancing
politician.

41:29.104 --> 41:31.072
Teresa Hurst is a rising star.

41:31.073 --> 41:33.374
She's on the practical
side of all the issues...

41:33.375 --> 41:34.638
And don't forget you're running

41:34.639 --> 41:37.411
on the "dismantling the world
as we know it" platform.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.447
I'm sorry... change foreign policy,

41:39.448 --> 41:41.649
- change the world.
- And if we're gonna go with that,

41:41.650 --> 41:44.118
you're gonna need me

41:44.119 --> 41:45.620
as your secretary of state, sir.

41:45.621 --> 41:47.655
Not your vice president.

41:47.656 --> 41:50.490
Right now, you need to
do what you can to win.

41:51.259 --> 41:52.792
Now she gets it.

41:55.563 --> 41:57.999
HENRY: <i>Remind me what was so bad</i>

41:58.000 --> 41:59.667
about the campaign circuit?

41:59.668 --> 42:01.535
Besides everything?

42:01.536 --> 42:03.771
I am so far behind
on these term papers.

42:03.772 --> 42:06.073
I'm gonna be up all night.
Maybe I should go downstairs.

42:06.074 --> 42:07.875
Why? I'm gonna be up all night

42:07.876 --> 42:10.344
with restructuring
American foreign policy.

42:10.345 --> 42:12.513
It'll be fun, be like college.

42:12.514 --> 42:15.516
We can order out some bad food.

42:15.517 --> 42:19.453
Cheeseburger pizza is on the way.

42:19.454 --> 42:22.123
You are so handsome.

42:22.124 --> 42:25.125
I'm gonna make sure we have Tums. Tums!

42:26.494 --> 42:28.695
What's that?

42:35.169 --> 42:37.305
Henry...

42:37.306 --> 42:38.839
where'd these come from?

42:38.840 --> 42:41.141
I have no idea.

42:45.379 --> 42:48.548
Someone is stalking our kids.

42:51.716 --> 42:59.316
