WEBVTT

00:18.810 --> 00:20.072
MAN:
Yo, watch out.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.261
First Street and Second Avenue.

01:38.860 --> 01:40.725
Very dangerous,
Afghanistan.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.227
Is that why you left?

01:42.270 --> 01:44.795
I have family, uh...

01:44.830 --> 01:46.058
young children.

01:46.100 --> 01:49.831
But many men would still welcome
the chance to become a martyr.

01:59.780 --> 02:01.919
LEBOWITZ: Detective Wells,
your testimony

02:01.950 --> 02:05.181
is that, while acting as an
undercover police officer,

02:05.220 --> 02:07.359
you allegedly purchased
illegal narcotics

02:07.390 --> 02:08.914
from my client.
Is that right?
Yes.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.827
And you've recalled
those conversations here today

02:11.860 --> 02:13.851
in rather astonishing detail.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.697
Haven't you?
Word for word.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.497
Word for word?

02:20.540 --> 02:21.438
Yeah.

02:21.470 --> 02:24.564
Conversations that occurred
over a year ago.

02:24.610 --> 02:26.931
October 22, 2011.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.504
It was a Saturday.

02:28.540 --> 02:30.770
Between 2:44 and 3:16
at Suriyo Thai

02:30.810 --> 02:32.744
in Kew Gardens.
And then again,
two days later,

02:32.780 --> 02:34.213
in your client's hotel room,

02:34.250 --> 02:36.548
between 6:46 and 7:17,

02:36.590 --> 02:38.842
when he tried
to sell me the drugs.

02:38.890 --> 02:40.482
What, exactly,
did you use

02:40.520 --> 02:42.624
to refresh your recollection
of those conversations?

02:42.660 --> 02:44.685
My recollections
don't need refreshing.

02:44.730 --> 02:45.856
So... what,

02:45.890 --> 02:47.949
you just... remember them?
Yeah.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.888
I remember everything.

02:49.930 --> 02:51.625
LEBOWITZ:
Everything?
CARRIE:
Yeah.

02:51.670 --> 02:52.694
Everything.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.231
I'm sure you do, Detective.

02:55.270 --> 02:57.261
No further questions,
Your Honor.

02:58.540 --> 03:00.303
Your Honor,
if you'll indulge me

03:00.340 --> 03:01.602
for a moment?

03:02.710 --> 03:03.938
PROSECUTOR:
Detective, where were you

03:03.980 --> 03:05.174
at 2:47 last Friday afternoon?

03:05.210 --> 03:07.770
Walking across the plaza out
front of the courthouse here.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.481
Did you, at that time,
recognize anyone

03:09.520 --> 03:10.987
who is presently
in this courtroom?

03:11.020 --> 03:13.887
Yes. Mr. Lebowitz over there,
and juror number seven,

03:13.920 --> 03:16.889
front row,
second from the end.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.989
Do you recall
what they were doing?

03:19.030 --> 03:20.895
Yeah, Mr. Lebowitz
was ordering souvlaki,

03:20.930 --> 03:23.728
no peppers, extra onions,

03:23.770 --> 03:25.897
and coconut milk, with pulp.

03:25.930 --> 03:27.864
And juror number seven
was talking to a very pretty

03:27.900 --> 03:29.367
young blonde woman.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.900
Your Honor, you can't allow...

03:30.940 --> 03:31.804
Easy, Lebowitz.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.979
Did you have souvlaki
last Friday or not?

03:34.010 --> 03:36.342
I-I don't really...

03:36.380 --> 03:37.449
Remember?

03:37.480 --> 03:38.879
PROSECUTOR:
What was juror seven

03:38.910 --> 03:40.719
wearing at that time,
Detective Wells?

03:40.750 --> 03:42.012
Brown pantsuit,

03:42.050 --> 03:43.813
cream blouse, Tory Birch flats,

03:43.850 --> 03:46.387
and a beige silk scarf.
You looked very nice.

03:46.420 --> 03:48.650
And the young woman
she was with?
Navy blue cardigan,

03:48.690 --> 03:49.827
six buttons down the front,

03:49.860 --> 03:52.021
white slacks, black flats,

03:52.060 --> 03:54.255
a Prada purse, black Tessuto...

03:54.300 --> 03:55.551
a knockoff.

03:55.600 --> 03:56.999
I'm sorry, you can tell

03:57.030 --> 03:59.430
by the clasp.
Oh, my daughter--

03:59.470 --> 04:00.994
I toldher it was fake.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.964
Anything else, Mr. Lebowitz?

04:11.310 --> 04:13.540
How'd it go?
Oh, walk in the park.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.719
I'm starting to feel bad
for these defense attorneys.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.547
And not the
rest of us?
Hm.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.581
Bashir Sajadi,
42,cabdnven

04:19.620 --> 04:20.985
Took a bullet
in the back.

04:21.020 --> 04:22.521
These two gentlemen

04:22.560 --> 04:23.982
are the ones who found him.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.850
What's he doing here?

04:25.890 --> 04:28.393
AL: Commissioner's Office
has eyes on this one.

04:28.430 --> 04:30.898
Carrie. Al.
How'd you get all the way
to Brooklyn, Eliot?

04:30.930 --> 04:32.932
And please tell me
it wasn't in that cab.

04:32.970 --> 04:35.894
I came with the Commissioner's
Joint Task Force.

04:35.940 --> 04:38.408
Turns out our victim
was one of their Informants.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.328
Sajadi was cooperating
in an investigation

04:40.380 --> 04:43.042
of a radical mosque.
_ A terrorist
Investigation.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.638
Now that they have
a high-profile homicide

04:44.680 --> 04:46.477
on their hands,
they called in Major Crimes.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.545
Theory is that the two targets
of the investigation

04:48.580 --> 04:51.583
somehow made Sajadi as a rat
and took him out.

04:51.620 --> 04:55.351
So where are the targets now?
JTF's trying to get eyes
on them as we speak.

04:55.390 --> 04:57.426
Trying to get
eyes on them?
Easy, Sparky.

04:57.460 --> 04:59.849
This is one _of over a_ dozen
active terrorist investigations

04:59.900 --> 05:01.822
they're running--
you can't expect them to have

05:01.860 --> 05:03.020
24/7 surveillance

05:03.070 --> 05:06.938
on all of them.
Yeah, well, tell that
to Bashir Sajadi.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.737
Trunk was open,

05:10.770 --> 05:12.579
but nothing's missing.

05:12.610 --> 05:14.771
Wallet, cell phone--
all here.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.340
No blood in the cab, either.

05:18.380 --> 05:22.783
Looks like they just pulled
him out and executed him.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.582
AL:
Not a place I'd choose

05:27.620 --> 05:28.780
to whack someone.

05:31.090 --> 05:33.627
Anybody could've made him.

05:34.730 --> 05:37.062
Well, whatever
they were planning...

05:37.100 --> 05:39.796
it was worth the risk.

05:54.650 --> 05:56.447
JAY: Man on the left
is Farhan Hazara.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.788
One on the right
is Babur Rashad.

05:58.820 --> 06:00.117
Hazara's an Afghan national;

06:00.160 --> 06:01.912
Rashad is strictly homegrown,
born in New Jersey.

06:01.960 --> 06:02.949
If the guy's
a suspected terrorist,

06:02.990 --> 06:04.082
how'd he get a work visa?

06:04.130 --> 06:05.722
It's all about
who you know, right?

06:05.760 --> 06:07.796
Rashad worked
with Coalition forces

06:07.830 --> 06:08.854
as a civilian interpreter.

06:08.900 --> 06:11.528
He's currently assigned
to the UN.

06:11.570 --> 06:13.561
What exactly were
they being investigated for?

06:13.600 --> 06:15.465
I reached out
to an FBI agent

06:15.500 --> 06:17.161
who's on the terrorism
task force-- he says

06:17.210 --> 06:19.906
both were suspects
in a potential weapons purchase.

06:19.940 --> 06:23.444
The idea was to set up a buy,
and then flip the two targets

06:23.480 --> 06:24.902
and move higher
up the food chain.

06:24.950 --> 06:26.542
How does our cabdriver fit in?

06:26.580 --> 06:28.810
Rashad and Hazara both
attend mosque in Brooklyn.

06:28.850 --> 06:30.738
The task force believes
the mosque was a source of money

06:30.790 --> 06:32.678
for the weapons buy.
Our cabdriver was flagged

06:32.720 --> 06:35.518
as a potential asset when
he applied for his green card.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.754
Basically,
he was told his application

06:36.790 --> 06:39.122
would be fast-tracked if he
agreed to infiltrate the mosque.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.799
The problem is, we got nothing
to link either of them to this.

06:41.830 --> 06:44.094
How about a dead cabbie who
just happened to be informing

06:44.130 --> 06:45.961
against them--
there's your link.
It's motive, yes.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.035
We're gonna need more.

06:47.070 --> 06:48.264
So let's get more.
The task force

06:48.300 --> 06:51.007
has eyes on both these guys now;
they're not going anywhere.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.031
In the meantime, we work
the case through forensics

06:53.080 --> 06:55.401
and witnesses just like
any other, right?

06:56.580 --> 07:00.118
Guy offers to help his new
country, takes a bullet for it.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.646
AL:
According to Sajadi's

07:05.690 --> 07:08.750
ride log, his last fare was
a pickup here on Broadway,

07:08.790 --> 07:12.556
between 73rd and 74th.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.051
No traffic cams-- but
look for other video.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.567
All right.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.227
Let's say it was
the two terrorists--

07:19.270 --> 07:22.194
what are they doing up here?

07:22.240 --> 07:24.959
I mean, think about it,
there's no obvious targets,

07:25.010 --> 07:27.570
landmarks, symbols
of New York, nothing.
Are you kidding?

07:27.610 --> 07:29.601
There's a Mango Dog on 7lst.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.504
Mango Dog is New York.

07:31.550 --> 07:32.619
They should use that.

07:32.650 --> 07:35.619
Busy subway station at 72nd.

07:35.650 --> 07:37.242
You could do
a lot of damage

07:37.290 --> 07:39.212
with a couple of assault rifles.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.217
Yeah.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.579
JAY:
Hey, I just got back

07:41.620 --> 07:43.087
a victim's cell phone records.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.586
'2
| And. _
There s an incoming call

07:44.630 --> 07:46.495
about a minute
after he picks up his fare.

07:46.530 --> 07:48.225
We know who it was?

07:48.260 --> 07:50.069
I ran down the number, but it
traced back to a disposable

07:50.100 --> 07:51.829
burner cell--
no name, no address.

07:51.870 --> 07:54.259
AL:
You try calling the number?

07:54.300 --> 07:57.235
Yep. No voicemail, no I.D.

07:57.270 --> 07:58.100
We're checking serial numbers,

07:58.140 --> 08:00.108
trying to find out
where it was sold.

08:00.140 --> 08:01.971
All right, keep on it.

08:03.180 --> 08:05.876
Looks like Sajadi
got a call.

08:05.910 --> 08:08.140
Probably while his killer
was in the cab.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.546
I'm thinking,
they call his cell,

08:10.590 --> 08:11.682
odds are it's someone
that knows him.

08:11.720 --> 08:12.948
What about his wife?

08:12.990 --> 08:15.151
I mean, if Sajadi
knew the caller,

08:15.190 --> 08:17.055
maybe his wife does, too.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.151
He was a good man,

08:22.200 --> 08:24.225
a good father.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.989
I had to get them
out of the house.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.689
Of course.
Bashir would

08:28.740 --> 08:31.538
never get involved
with terrorists.

08:31.570 --> 08:32.537
Hamid!

08:39.580 --> 08:42.617
It's all fixed.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.852
He looks like his father.
Mrs. Sajadi,

08:49.890 --> 08:51.926
we know your husband
was doing nothing wrong.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.996
In fact, he was working
with the police

08:54.030 --> 08:55.327
to prevent a terrorist attack.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.726
Bashir was working
for the police?

08:57.770 --> 08:59.567
He was helping
in an investigation.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.160
Is that why he was killed?
We're not sure.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.101
Ma'am, do you recognize

09:05.140 --> 09:07.131
either of these men?

09:09.210 --> 09:10.438
No. I've never seen them.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.938
I don't understand-- why would
Bashir get involved with this?

09:13.980 --> 09:16.642
Because he was promised
a green card.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.982
He did it so that you
and your kids could
have a chance.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.851
Mrs. Sajadi,

09:22.890 --> 09:26.758
your husband got a phone call
the day he was killed.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.189
Do you know this number?

09:30.230 --> 09:31.822
That's Mo's number.

09:31.870 --> 09:33.098
Mo?

09:33.140 --> 09:34.835
Moshin Aziz,
Bashir's best friend.

09:34.870 --> 09:37.009
Do you know where
we could find him?

09:37.040 --> 09:38.962
He runs a flower shop.

09:39.010 --> 09:41.808
Ijust talked to him.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.968
He's going to do the flowers
for Bashir's funeral.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.256
Moshin Aziz?
That's right.

09:53.290 --> 09:56.088
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about Bashir Sajadi.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.656
MO:
Have they found out who did it?

09:57.690 --> 09:59.282
AL:
No, not yet.

09:59.330 --> 10:02.663
MO: I told Bashir driving a cab
is too dangerous.

10:02.700 --> 10:03.860
He was robbed already twice.

10:03.900 --> 10:04.992
Did his wife tell you?

10:05.030 --> 10:06.258
We don't think
this was a robbery.

10:06.300 --> 10:07.369
What are you talking about?

10:07.400 --> 10:09.766
Mo, right?
You mind ifI call you Mo?

10:09.810 --> 10:11.129
Sure.

10:11.170 --> 10:12.933
555-1246-- that
your cell phone number?

10:12.980 --> 10:15.699
Yes. Why are you asking me this?

10:15.740 --> 10:18.049
You called Bashir
the afternoon he was murdered.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.718
Yes, I called him.
AL:
Thing is,

10:19.750 --> 10:22.275
we tried to find the records
for that phone, only the number

10:22.320 --> 10:23.787
wasn't traceable--
there a reason for that?

10:23.820 --> 10:25.378
Untraceable? No.

10:25.420 --> 10:27.012
No, I just don't want to pay

10:27.060 --> 10:28.379
for an expensive
cell phone plan.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.956
I pay in cash.

10:29.990 --> 10:32.220
Look-- here's my phone;
I have nothing to hide.

10:32.260 --> 10:33.955
Why did you call him?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.252
To see if he wanted to watch
a football game with me.

10:36.300 --> 10:39.224
Football? There's no football
in the summertime, Mr. Aziz.

10:39.270 --> 10:41.261
I mean soccer. There was
a game in Prospect Park.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.131
It's not a crime
to like soccer, is it?

10:43.170 --> 10:45.229
Well, that depends
on who you're talking to.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.670
I got nothing against soccer;
I just prefer football.

10:48.980 --> 10:50.402
Listen, Mo,
you may have been

10:50.450 --> 10:51.940
talking to Bashir when

10:51.980 --> 10:54.312
his killer or killers
were in the car with him.

10:54.350 --> 10:56.215
What?
Did he say anything to you

10:56.250 --> 10:58.741
about his passengers,
anything at all?

10:58.790 --> 11:00.212
Oh, my God.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.215
What?

11:01.260 --> 11:03.080
When I talked to
Bashir that day,

11:03.130 --> 11:05.223
someone was speaking
Pashto to him.

11:05.260 --> 11:06.693
Did you hear what was said?

11:06.730 --> 11:08.823
Uh, only a few words.

11:08.860 --> 11:11.897
But it was a man and it
was definitely Pashto.

11:11.930 --> 11:14.865
The passenger's fluency
in Pashto probably means

11:14.900 --> 11:17.232
the assailant or assailants_come
from either of these regions

11:17.270 --> 11:18.430
in Afghanistan or Pakistan.

11:18.470 --> 11:21.177
Which matches the
ethnic background

11:21.210 --> 11:23.098
of our two terrorism suspects.

11:25.350 --> 11:27.341
Okay.

11:27.380 --> 11:28.916
Where's all this
coming from, Burns?

11:28.950 --> 11:30.087
Sorry?

11:30.120 --> 11:31.849
It's just, I can't imagine

11:31.890 --> 11:33.414
the 117th in Queens

11:33.460 --> 11:35.314
required any kind of

11:35.360 --> 11:36.418
geo-political expertise.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.155
Oh, you'd be surprised.

11:40.530 --> 11:43.124
Okay, the problem is,

11:43.170 --> 11:45.263
according to the task force's
surveillance reports,

11:45.300 --> 11:48.360
we can't definitively place
their terrorist suspects

11:48.400 --> 11:50.061
at our murder scene.
But nothing says
they weren't there.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.759
The task force
lost track of them

11:51.810 --> 11:52.834
for three hours
that afternoon.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.177
That's not enough.

11:54.210 --> 11:55.108
And you already have motive.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.108
Sajadi was helping
to set these guys up.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.300
Al, I understand you want
to go get these guys.

11:59.350 --> 12:01.079
Id... I don't think
we're there.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.314
Okay, you don't think so

12:02.350 --> 12:03.749
or your task force buddies
don't think so?

12:03.790 --> 12:06.850
I don't think I like
what you're implying.

12:06.890 --> 12:08.152
Then I won't imply it,
I'll just say it straight up.

12:08.190 --> 12:10.226
JTF wants to keep these
guys on the street,

12:10.260 --> 12:11.420
so they can make
their weapons sting.

12:11.460 --> 12:12.688
Which makes sense, they've been
building it for six months.

12:12.730 --> 12:16.188
And my guess is, they don't give
two cents about a dead cabbie.

12:16.230 --> 12:18.266
Even one who may have died
trying to help them.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.393
Oh, please,
it is not that simple.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.032
What is simple is I got
a murder investigation,

12:22.070 --> 12:23.469
and I got two suspects
I want to talk to.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.534
Fine!

12:24.570 --> 12:25.764
I'll see what I can do.

12:25.810 --> 12:26.799
Not good enough.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.330
Excuse me?
When you hired me,

12:28.380 --> 12:29.972
the deal was I make
the tactical calls

12:30.010 --> 12:31.272
and you back me up.

12:31.310 --> 12:33.175
I'm making this call.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.074
Now it's your turn.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.418
Okay.

12:37.450 --> 12:39.247
Okay...

12:39.290 --> 12:40.518
but the terrorism guys
are gonna want

12:40.560 --> 12:41.879
to make the collar.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.753
I'm fine with that.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.294
Baku, by the way.

12:51.430 --> 12:53.534
Live feed incoming.

12:53.570 --> 12:56.869
They got them up in the Bronx.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.559
How did you get Eliot
to agree to this?

12:58.610 --> 13:00.339
I believe you've experienced
my powers of persuasion.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.029
Oh, so you plowed him
with mai tais?

13:02.080 --> 13:04.776
What? That's not how I...

13:06.250 --> 13:08.377
What, you got something?
OFFICER: Get out of the car!

13:08.420 --> 13:11.139
Lift your shirt! Turn around!

13:12.860 --> 13:15.215
On your knees! Get down!

13:15.260 --> 13:16.352
OFFICER:
Hands behind your head!

13:21.330 --> 13:24.367
I need to talk to Webster.

13:26.170 --> 13:27.239
CARRIE:
Ooh.

13:27.270 --> 13:30.103
I see you're settling in.

13:30.140 --> 13:32.404
Seems like I never left
these burial grounds.

13:32.440 --> 13:33.475
Well, you're glowing.

13:33.510 --> 13:35.478
Looks like Manhattan
agrees With you.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.546
Oh, yeah, well, it's a whole
different world, you know?

13:37.580 --> 13:39.445
Oh, it is indeed.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.017
The Manhattan dead are a much
better class of cadaver.

13:42.050 --> 13:44.541
I just autopsied
a hedge fund manager,

13:44.590 --> 13:47.479
and his arteries still
reeked of porterhouse.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.351
So, I'm here

13:49.390 --> 13:51.551
about the cab driver, Sajadi.

13:51.590 --> 13:52.989
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

13:54.130 --> 13:55.449
Okay.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.263
The bullet_was from
a nine-millimeter.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.120
The projectile entered and hit

13:59.170 --> 14:01.138
the spinal column
and fragmented.

14:01.170 --> 14:04.003
I noted a slight
downward trajectory.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.031
There were
no defen5ive wounds,

14:06.070 --> 14:07.901
uh, which means
he either knew his killer

14:07.940 --> 14:09.532
and exited the
cab voluntarily,

14:09.580 --> 14:12.401
or he was taken out at gunpoint.

14:12.450 --> 14:15.078
If there was no struggle,
why the bruise on the forehead?

14:15.120 --> 14:18.044
Now, that was odd because
it's not blunt force trauma

14:18.090 --> 14:20.058
in the strictest sense
of the word.

14:20.090 --> 14:21.955
Well, what
The injury

14:21.990 --> 14:25.187
was uniform, so it wasn't
from the butt of a gun

14:25.230 --> 14:28.222
or a pipe or
anything like that.

14:29.260 --> 14:31.399
No blood in the cab either.

14:31.430 --> 14:34.399
Looks like they just pulled him
out and executed him.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.533
Not a place I'd choose
to whack someone.

14:59.290 --> 15:00.427
Lift your shirt!

15:00.460 --> 15:02.451
Turn around!
On your knees! Get down!

15:02.500 --> 15:03.990
Hands behind your head!

15:04.030 --> 15:06.396
Could he have hit his head
on the side of the cab?

15:06.430 --> 15:07.260
You mean a face

15:07.300 --> 15:09.598
Yeah. Let's say Sajadi
is on his knees,

15:09.640 --> 15:11.301
hands behind his head.

15:11.340 --> 15:13.376
They shoot him,
it propels him forward,

15:13.410 --> 15:15.037
he hits his head on the cab.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.241
That could cause
the injuries, yeah.
If I'm right,

15:17.280 --> 15:18.508
the position he was in is part

15:18.550 --> 15:20.643
of an American military
detention protocol.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.648
Why would terrorists
waste time detaining him?

15:22.680 --> 15:25.342
They would've just shot him
right in the cab.
So you're saying

15:25.390 --> 15:27.381
the killer had some sort
of military training?

15:27.420 --> 15:30.059
I'm saying whoever it is

15:30.090 --> 15:32.456
knew enough to have Sajadi
lift his shirt

15:32.490 --> 15:34.526
so they could check him
for explosives.

15:36.430 --> 15:38.523
I think our guy's a soldier.

15:47.310 --> 15:48.709
A soldier?
Well, according
to Carrie's theory,

15:48.740 --> 15:50.674
whoever killed Bashir Sajadi
put him on his knees

15:50.710 --> 15:52.109
with his hands on his head,

15:52.150 --> 15:53.412
which is why,
when he was shot...

15:54.720 --> 15:57.188
...he couldn't reflexively
brace his fall.

15:57.220 --> 15:59.643
Interesting theory, but at
this point, it's just a cartoon.

15:59.690 --> 16:01.157
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:01.190 --> 16:03.488
No, a cartoon is a series
of drawings, my friend.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.122
This is
a computer-generated,

16:05.160 --> 16:06.582
digital-sequenced animation.

16:06.630 --> 16:08.257
You really
can't compare the two.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.326
Like comparing Pinocchio
to, say, X-Men.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.998
Exactly. All right,
so can I proceed?

16:14.040 --> 16:16.258
Please.
Okay. So I talked
to an Army attach

16:16.300 --> 16:18.006
and described
the arrest protocol.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.008
He said the American military
trains its personnel

16:20.040 --> 16:22.270
out in the field to place
a captive on their knees,

16:22.310 --> 16:23.777
with their hands clasped
on their head.

16:23.810 --> 16:26.142
And to have prisoners

16:26.180 --> 16:28.148
lift their shirts to_s_ee if
they're wearing a SUIClde vest.

16:28.180 --> 16:30.489
All right, but anybody could've
learned that protocol.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.488
I thought so, too,
so we checked the bullet.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.408
I got ballistics to trace
the firing pin markings

16:34.460 --> 16:36.348
on the back of the brass shell
and guess what--

16:36.390 --> 16:37.527
the pin
most likely came

16:37.560 --> 16:39.323
from a Beretta M9.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.056
Standard issue
for the US. Army.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.136
ELIOT: God, I don't know
which is worse--

16:51.170 --> 16:53.809
having a terrorist on the loose
or accusing one of our own.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.239
I don't know.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.599
Guys, this seems pretty thin.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.540
It's the best theory
we've got right now.

16:58.580 --> 17:01.310
Yeah. If I remember,
yesterday's best theory

17:01.350 --> 17:03.784
was that our two terrorism
suspects were the shooters,

17:03.820 --> 17:05.048
who-- we now know

17:05.090 --> 17:07.183
from questioning--
both had alibis.

17:07.220 --> 17:09.279
Which we never would've known...
When the Feds went in

17:09.320 --> 17:11.288
after the arrests,
they found a weapons stash

17:11.330 --> 17:12.524
and, like, a zillion connections

17:12.560 --> 17:15.324
to other al-Qaeda
operatives, so...

17:15.360 --> 17:16.520
I kind of look like a genius.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.425
Oh, you're welcome.
Thank you.

17:18.470 --> 17:21.598
So you're saying our shooter's
possible U.S. military?

17:21.640 --> 17:22.629
Yes.

17:22.670 --> 17:24.831
We run with this,

17:24.870 --> 17:26.337
there's gonna be
push back.

17:26.370 --> 17:28.338
Well, push back
is my middle name.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.473
Actually, it's not.
Your middle name is...
Okay, don't say it.

17:30.510 --> 17:32.307
Well, it's
a lovely name.
Don't say it.

17:32.350 --> 17:33.669
AL:
Her middle name...
June 5, 1999.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.676
Oh, you wouldn't.
I have two words
for you.

17:35.720 --> 17:36.778
Murphy bed.

17:36.820 --> 17:38.788
Wow.
Guys...

17:38.820 --> 17:40.708
Murphy bed. Oh, yeah.
ELIOT: Guys. Guys.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.512
If this is some weird thing

17:42.560 --> 17:44.528
you're doing to make me
so uncomfortable

17:44.560 --> 17:45.822
that I go along
with you

17:45.860 --> 17:48.693
just to get you out
of my office, it is working.

17:48.730 --> 17:51.221
I will take your soldier-
as-shooter theory upstairs,

17:51.270 --> 17:53.397
but we got to be
on solid ground.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.362
And all you know for sure,
right now, is the guy

17:55.400 --> 17:57.106
hailed a cab
at 73rd and Broadway.

17:57.140 --> 17:58.232
I mean, look at this.

17:58.270 --> 18:00.738
There's, like, a thousand things
he could've been doing.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.372
For all we know, Mango Dog

18:02.410 --> 18:04.503
could be having a two-for-one
special for vets.

18:04.550 --> 18:07.371
I told you,
I need something solid.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.717
AL:
There's a Mango Dog

18:08.750 --> 18:11.139
on 7lst. Mango Dog

18:11.190 --> 18:13.181
is New York.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.141
CARRIE:
What's right there

18:37.180 --> 18:38.477
at 73rd and Broadway?

18:39.510 --> 18:41.614
ELIOT:
193 W. 73rd.

18:41.650 --> 18:43.447
It's a municipal building.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.788
Do you have a list of tenants?

18:50.730 --> 18:53.221
ELIOT:
Veteran's Administration

18:53.260 --> 18:55.649
runs an annex there.
Huh.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.497
Solid enough?

18:59.570 --> 19:01.435
(indistinct conversations,
phones ringing)

19:08.510 --> 19:10.307
WOMAN: So this is about one
of our patients?

19:10.350 --> 19:13.478
Yeah. I need you to help me
identify someone, a soldier.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.239
He's a person of interest
in a homicide investigation.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.918
Well, who was the victim?

19:17.950 --> 19:20.851
A cab driver. Bashir Sajadi.

19:20.890 --> 19:23.950
He left behind a wife,
two small children.

19:23.990 --> 19:25.548
I'm sorry.

19:25.590 --> 19:28.627
And all you know is this soldier
served in Afghanistan?

19:28.660 --> 19:31.322
Without other parameters,
I'm not sure I can help you.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.861
Dr. Perkins, how many soldiers
come back from Afghanistan

19:33.900 --> 19:35.390
speaking fluent Pashto?

19:35.440 --> 19:36.896
Well, it generally
takes several tours

19:36.940 --> 19:38.760
to build up
language proficiency.

19:38.810 --> 19:40.778
There's another parameter.

19:40.810 --> 19:43.574
I mean, how many people
in your session yesterday

19:43.610 --> 19:45.578
did several tours
in Afghanistan?

19:45.610 --> 19:49.273
Dr. Perkins, I need your help.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.413
I'm running out of time here.

19:51.450 --> 19:52.587
Please.

19:53.620 --> 19:56.657
There is one man.

19:56.690 --> 19:58.624
Okay.
I've been worried
about him, actually,

19:58.660 --> 20:00.423
because he's been
destabilizing,

20:00.460 --> 20:01.757
missing sessions.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.395
Uh, Corporal John Curtis.

20:07.470 --> 20:09.438
He had an appointment yesterday.

20:09.470 --> 20:11.301
He came...

20:11.340 --> 20:13.308
but then he walked out.

20:13.340 --> 20:14.807
Why?

20:14.840 --> 20:16.478
John suffers from
post-traumatic

20:16.510 --> 20:18.501
stress disorder.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.676
Actually,

20:19.710 --> 20:22.508
I'm not sure calling it
a disorder is really accurate.

20:22.550 --> 20:23.744
In fact, I think
there'd be something wrong

20:23.790 --> 20:26.839
if our troops came home and
were not profoundly affected by

20:26.890 --> 20:28.778
their experience.
And in John's case,

20:28.820 --> 20:30.981
a particularly
devastating experience.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.986
What happened?

20:33.030 --> 20:35.351
In his last deployment,
he lost his best friend

20:35.400 --> 20:36.628
to a suicide bomber.

20:36.660 --> 20:38.525
I don't know
all the details.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.595
I do know
that that same blast led

20:40.640 --> 20:42.596
to John's traumatic
brain injury.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.528
He was in a coma
for almost a month.

20:44.570 --> 20:47.869
You say you don't know
all the details. Why?

20:47.910 --> 20:49.673
He says he can't remember.

20:49.710 --> 20:51.644
Can't or won't?

20:51.680 --> 20:55.377
John blames himself
for his friend's death.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.012
That guilt is like

20:57.050 --> 20:59.041
a barrier preventing
his recovery.

20:59.090 --> 21:01.786
His amnesia, delusion even,

21:01.820 --> 21:04.323
about the events of that day,
willful or not,

21:04.360 --> 21:07.022
acts like a kind of... of armor

21:07.060 --> 21:09.426
protecting him
from the truth.

21:09.460 --> 21:12.566
John forgets in
order to survive.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.591
But only by remembering
can he begin to heal.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.737
What?

21:17.770 --> 21:19.408
No. Nothing.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.907
Uh, well said.

21:22.510 --> 21:25.638
I'm sorry. You said
he

21:25.680 --> 21:28.649
Well, part of our program
involves random drug testing.

21:28.680 --> 21:29.942
When he arrived, he was told

21:29.980 --> 21:31.880
that he'd have
to leave a urine sample.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.616
Is it possible he was
on drugs yesterday?

21:34.660 --> 21:36.616
Yes.

21:36.660 --> 21:38.628
It's certainly
a possibility.

21:38.660 --> 21:39.957
Thank you.

21:39.990 --> 21:41.548
Right back here,
we got the spa.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.953
This right here
is the party bus.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.424
Johnny Boy here just got
a love letter from his girl.

21:46.470 --> 21:48.768
She loves him so much.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.961
All right, you're just jealous
because nobody loves you.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.637
You see this fine specimen

21:52.670 --> 21:54.638
standing here before you?

21:54.680 --> 21:58.104
Back home, I get love every
night of the week, brother.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.345
SOLDIER:
Moms don't count, Richie.

22:00.380 --> 22:02.109
CURTIS: Oh!

22:02.150 --> 22:03.617
Next time I do your mom,

22:03.650 --> 22:05.618
I'll let her know
you said that.

22:05.650 --> 22:07.584
All right, no, wait.
This is serious here.

22:07.620 --> 22:10.384
I'm making this 'cause
I want everybody back home

22:10.430 --> 22:12.079
_ to know what
it's really like out here.

22:13.930 --> 22:16.990
What is it really like?

22:17.030 --> 22:18.668
It's like war, bro.

22:18.700 --> 22:20.736
And trust me,

22:20.770 --> 22:23.739
nobody wants to know
what that's like.

22:23.770 --> 22:26.432
He didn't come back
the same.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.131
I don't think
any of 'em do.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.445
That was him
on his last deployment.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.004
He was very proud
of his service.

22:33.050 --> 22:35.518
And that's Richie,
the buddy he lost?

22:35.550 --> 22:36.847
Uh-huh.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.678
John did four tours,
he lost a lot of friends.

22:39.720 --> 22:40.516
They all did.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.757
But Richie...
that was different.

22:43.790 --> 22:44.427
In what way?

22:44.460 --> 22:47.395
They just really hit it off,

22:47.430 --> 22:51.719
and John just sort of took him
under his wing.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.692
Aanay. . .

22:53.740 --> 22:55.833
John got hurt bad.

22:55.870 --> 22:57.758
I went to Germany
to see him,

22:57.810 --> 23:00.472
and they were giving him
meds for the pain

23:00.510 --> 23:02.603
and meds
to help him sleep.

23:02.640 --> 23:05.677
He could never relax
when he came home.

23:05.710 --> 23:10.044
He was always on alert,
always on edge.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.719
And the flashbacks...

23:12.750 --> 23:14.650
He pulled a gun on me once.

23:14.690 --> 23:17.011
He thought I was
a Taliban.

23:17.060 --> 23:20.496
After, he-he begged me
to forgive him,

23:20.530 --> 23:23.693
and I told him there-there's
nothing to forgive.

23:23.730 --> 23:26.722
What about a girlfriend?

23:26.770 --> 23:28.761
Oh, he'd been engaged,

23:28.800 --> 23:32.668
but it was too much
for her to handle.

23:35.840 --> 23:39.742
If he's done this,

23:39.780 --> 23:42.078
I know he has to answer for it,

23:42.120 --> 23:45.044
but please, please try

23:45.090 --> 23:46.614
not to hurt him.

23:46.650 --> 23:48.151
He deserves more.

23:48.190 --> 23:49.555
All those boys do.

23:49.590 --> 23:51.683
We'll try.

23:51.730 --> 23:55.621
Mrs. Curtis, we have
a cabdriver's log

23:55.660 --> 23:57.821
that indicates your son
was heading downtown.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.223
Any idea where he was going?

23:59.270 --> 24:02.660
John's mentor lives downtown.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.839
He's like an AA sponsor.

24:04.870 --> 24:07.475
Stan's a Vietnam vet.

24:07.510 --> 24:11.002
He been through what kids like
John are going through now.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.006
Do you have an address for Stan?

24:13.050 --> 24:14.074
Stanley Lewis.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.747
Yeah, I think so.

24:15.780 --> 24:18.840
Um, he lives on, uh, First
Street near Second Avenue.

24:18.890 --> 24:21.256
Um, I can get the, uh,

24:21.290 --> 24:23.781
the exact number.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.792
Remember, we could have
two seasoned combat vets

24:35.840 --> 24:37.091
holed up in there with guns.

24:37.140 --> 24:39.131
We take it nice and slow.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.711
Stanley Lewis?

24:52.050 --> 24:53.654
Who the hell 'is out there?!

24:53.690 --> 24:55.157
It's the police, Mr. Lewis.

24:55.190 --> 24:56.589
Please open your door.

25:02.860 --> 25:04.191
What is this?

25:04.230 --> 25:05.299
We're looking for John Curtis.

25:05.330 --> 25:06.763
He's not here.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.791
AL:
Where is he?
How the hell should I know?

25:08.840 --> 25:10.603
Because we know
he came to see you.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.528
We'd like to have
a look around.

25:12.570 --> 25:13.673
Go ahead in.

25:14.840 --> 25:16.102
OFFICER:
Clear.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.004
OFFICER 2:
Back room clear.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.770
Make yourself at home.
OFFICER: All clear!

25:19.810 --> 25:21.812
OFFICER 3: Stand by.
Did you check with the mother?

25:21.850 --> 25:24.182
MURRAY:
He hasn't shown up.

25:24.220 --> 25:25.141
LEWIS:
So what's going on?

25:25.190 --> 25:27.112
I mean, what do you
want with John anyway?

25:27.150 --> 25:28.708
He's a suspect
in a murder.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.648
_We need to know
if you've seen him.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.651
Whatever he's done,
he needs help.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.567
And none of us want_to see
anyone else hurt, right?

25:37.600 --> 25:40.160
I haven't seen him
Since last night.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.337
He slept on the couch.

25:41.370 --> 25:43.167
But he was gone when I woke up.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.565
Well, what about earlier?

25:44.610 --> 25:46.009
What about it?
Where were you?

25:46.040 --> 25:47.928
At work.
People can confirm that?

25:47.980 --> 25:49.777
Yeah, sure, they can confirm it.

25:49.810 --> 25:51.801
Look, what exactly did John do?

25:51.850 --> 25:53.943
He shot a cabdriver; an Afghan.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.572
I knew there was something wrong

25:55.620 --> 25:57.269
when he asked to stay the night.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.083
And you didn't bother
to ask what?

25:59.120 --> 26:00.917
I've seen John like that before.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.019
And when he's like that,

26:03.060 --> 26:04.288
he doesn't want to talk.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.321
He just wants
someplace to feel safe.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.248
But he's never
hurt anyone before.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.962
You have weapons.
We ran your permits.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.592
Everything I got's legal.

26:12.630 --> 26:14.166
Show us.

26:23.240 --> 26:26.038
He broke the lock.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.274
Damn.

26:27.310 --> 26:29.016
What type of weapons
did you have?

26:29.050 --> 26:32.110
An M-16 rifle
and a nine-millimeter.

26:32.150 --> 26:33.117
M-16.

26:33.150 --> 26:35.289
"This is my rifle.

26:35.320 --> 26:39.086
There are many like it,
but this one is mine."

26:39.130 --> 26:40.995
I managed to keep
my service weapons

26:41.030 --> 26:42.395
after I mustered
out in '69.

26:42.430 --> 26:46.218
They were the only things
I had that kept me alive.

26:46.270 --> 26:48.898
An assault rifle _
and a semiautomatic pistol.

26:48.940 --> 26:51.636
Looks like this guy Curtis is
getting ready

26:51.670 --> 26:52.659
to start his own war.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.170
RICHIE:
Right here is the party bus.

26:56.210 --> 26:57.939
Johnny Boy here
just got a love letter

26:57.980 --> 26:59.345
from his girl.

26:59.380 --> 27:01.314
She loves him so much.

27:01.350 --> 27:03.375
CURTIS:
All right, you're just jealous
because nobody loves you.

27:03.420 --> 27:05.183
RICHIE:
You see this...

27:32.810 --> 27:34.277
So?

27:34.320 --> 27:36.345
Where the hell
did you get this?

27:36.380 --> 27:37.449
Oh, it wasn't that hard,
actually.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.879
I mean, assuming
your ex-girlfriend

27:38.920 --> 27:40.342
is an imaging expert
at the Pentagon.

27:40.390 --> 27:42.017
You give her a GPS location

27:42.060 --> 27:44.278
with the exact time and date
of what you're looking for.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.854
Oh, you have a girlfriend
at the Pentagon?

27:45.890 --> 27:48.427
Ex. Yvette. She was
a cheerleader when I knew her.

27:48.460 --> 27:49.597
You dated a cheerleader.
Nice.

27:49.630 --> 27:52.724
Six months, 11 days, and four...
You know what? Forget it.

27:52.770 --> 27:54.135
Now you sound like me.

27:54.170 --> 27:55.728
What's this?

27:55.770 --> 27:57.738
Video surveillance
from a drone

27:57.770 --> 27:59.465
the day of Curtis's
suicide bomber.

27:59.510 --> 28:01.774
Jay got it from a
cheerleader at the Pentagon.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.869
There are cheerleaders
at the Pentagon?

28:03.910 --> 28:05.275
It's a long story.

28:05.310 --> 28:07.107
Look at this.

28:07.150 --> 28:09.141
Richie leaves his cover,
but Curtis doesn't.

28:09.180 --> 28:10.477
AL: Why would he
leave his cover?

28:10.520 --> 28:12.943
I don't know,
and Curtis can't remember.

28:12.990 --> 28:14.287
Well, this is the Army's

28:14.320 --> 28:16.459
official incident report
on the bombing.

28:16.490 --> 28:19.482
They determined the blast
was triggered by a cell phone.

28:19.530 --> 28:21.020
Yeah, right there.
He must have heard

28:21.060 --> 28:22.493
the phone ring.

28:22.530 --> 28:24.498
No. Look, this is what
interests me right here.

28:24.530 --> 28:27.169
See this? Richie's got
this guy on the ground.

28:27.200 --> 28:30.397
Then he leans into the car
like he's looking for something,

28:30.440 --> 28:32.203
then he looks back

28:32.240 --> 28:33.309
to Curtis.

28:33.340 --> 28:34.477
I don't know.

28:34.510 --> 28:35.909
Maybe he's looking
for a weapon?

28:35.940 --> 28:37.840
According to the report,
the next day,

28:37.880 --> 28:39.802
Curtis's unit went looking
for the bomb maker,

28:39.850 --> 28:41.818
only Curtis never got to go.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.784
He's going after Richie's
killers.

28:43.820 --> 28:45.788
Look, he goes to counseling,

28:45.820 --> 28:47.811
he freaks out,
he leaves, gets in a cab.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.181
A cell phone call
set off the bomb,

28:50.220 --> 28:52.984
so, maybe, when the cab driver
got the call from Mo,

28:53.030 --> 28:55.328
it triggered some kind
of flashback?

28:55.360 --> 28:57.248
Right, and suddenly,
he thinks he's face-to-face

28:57.300 --> 28:59.768
with someone he believes

28:59.800 --> 29:00.937
is the enemy.

29:00.970 --> 29:03.131
It's the perfect storm, and
it takes him right back here

29:03.170 --> 29:05.866
to this moment.

29:11.050 --> 29:14.247
Mo's cell phone call.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.419
The suicide
bomber got a call

29:16.450 --> 29:19.248
from the guy who built the bomb,
right before the explosion.

29:19.290 --> 29:20.518
What if the call

29:20.550 --> 29:22.984
Sajadi got from Mo
made Curtis think

29:23.020 --> 29:24.487
it was the same thing?

29:24.530 --> 29:25.485
AL:
Moshin Aziz?

29:25.530 --> 29:27.828
MO:
That's right.

29:27.860 --> 29:30.829
Like to ask you a few
questions about Bashir Sajadi.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.929
He tracks Mo to the flower shop.

29:32.970 --> 29:34.267
The workers there--

29:34.300 --> 29:35.858
they're using
helium tanks, wires,

29:35.900 --> 29:38.801
wire cutters,
and he thinks he's in

29:38.840 --> 29:39.932
a bomb-making factory.

29:58.990 --> 30:00.480
JAY:
But how would he

30:00.530 --> 30:01.827
track Mo down?

30:01.860 --> 30:02.827
He's got the cabby
at gunpoint.

30:02.860 --> 30:04.896
He could have forced him
to tell him who called.

30:04.930 --> 30:07.160
We better get to M0.
Oh, no need.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.895
Logged into an FBI
monitoring system,

30:08.940 --> 30:10.828
pulled this from the bank's
security camera.

30:12.070 --> 30:14.402
Looks like it's business
as usual at Mo's.

30:16.240 --> 30:17.969
They had a delivery van
right here.

30:20.410 --> 30:22.378
I saw the calendar.

30:24.950 --> 30:27.487
Today's the eighteenth.
Mo's got a wedding.

30:27.520 --> 30:28.919
Curtis'll be there.

30:30.390 --> 30:32.381
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

30:46.670 --> 30:51.369
Don't move, or I will drop
your ass to the ground!

31:20.140 --> 31:23.075
All of you, out! Now!

31:23.110 --> 31:24.577
(guests and wedding party
gasping, murmuring anxiously)

31:24.610 --> 31:26.248
Move!

31:33.520 --> 31:36.284
(sirens blaring,
tires squealing)

31:46.270 --> 31:48.090
(workers and wedding party
shouﬂng)

31:48.140 --> 31:51.268
WOMAN:
Help, please! He's got a gun!

31:51.310 --> 31:53.232
All right, calm down,
calm down... tell me.

31:53.270 --> 31:54.669
He's got a man inside.

31:54.710 --> 31:56.439
Who _
He was setting
up the flowers.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.675
We all came inside
for photographs and...

31:58.710 --> 32:00.246
Are

32:00.280 --> 32:01.315
Just the one man.

32:01.350 --> 32:03.409
He told us to get out,
and we ran.

32:03.450 --> 32:06.214
Go to this officer now.
She's going to take care of you.

32:06.250 --> 32:08.218
I've got a squad
at the rear exit

32:08.260 --> 32:09.079
and a team covering the front,

32:09.120 --> 32:11.088
but my guys need
to get eyes on Curtis.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.449
Send in a team with optics

32:12.490 --> 32:14.299
just to find out
what we're dealing with.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.162
Team Leader, Blue One.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.269
Blue One, go.

32:19.300 --> 32:20.221
OFFICER:
Blue One and Two in position.

32:20.270 --> 32:21.931
TEAM LEADER:
Blue One, do you have a visual?

32:24.640 --> 32:26.631
Transmitting.

32:29.380 --> 32:30.972
AL:
It's Aziz.

32:31.010 --> 32:32.204
Yeah, and Curtis has rigged him
with explosives.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.571
And the trigger's that
phone in his hand.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.042
Leader, Blue One.
I have a shot.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.241
Negative. Tell him
to hold his position.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.212
He could set that off
with a tap of his finger.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.683
Tell me what you did.

32:44.460 --> 32:46.655
I don't know about any bombs!

32:46.690 --> 32:48.658
Don't you lie to me
or you're dead!

32:48.700 --> 32:51.089
His doctor's on her way.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.666
John forgets
in order to survive.

32:55.700 --> 32:58.669
But only by remembering
can he begin to heal.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.132
We don't have time.

33:00.170 --> 33:02.274
You can't go in there.

33:02.310 --> 33:04.449
Curtis thinks he's got the guy
who killed his friend.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.539
If he doesn't get an answer,
he's gonna kill him.

33:06.580 --> 33:08.548
I can help him
find that answer, Al.

33:08.580 --> 33:10.047
You know I can.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.312
Here.

33:12.350 --> 33:14.659
He's got an M-16
and half a pound of C-4.

33:14.690 --> 33:17.352
If he wants to kill me,
this isn't gonna stop him.

33:29.770 --> 33:31.806
John Curtis.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.172
Who the hell are you?

33:35.210 --> 33:37.235
My name is Carrie.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.679
I'm not armed.

33:38.710 --> 33:40.507
I'm here to help.
I just want to talk.

33:40.550 --> 33:42.040
No, there's nothing
to talk about.

33:42.080 --> 33:42.819
T_his son of a bitch
is gonna tell me

33:42.850 --> 33:44.408
how he killed Richie.

33:44.450 --> 33:47.385
He can't tell you that, John.

33:47.420 --> 33:49.718
He can't tell you,
because...

33:49.760 --> 33:52.183
he didn't do it;
he wasn't there.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.652
What are you talking about?
This is him.

33:53.690 --> 33:56.693
This is the guy that built
the bomb that killed Richie.

33:56.730 --> 33:57.799
He isn't.

33:57.830 --> 33:58.797
You need to stay back.

33:58.830 --> 33:59.797
I'm not armed.

33:59.830 --> 34:01.161
I'm not armed, okay?

34:01.200 --> 34:02.337
Ijust...

34:02.370 --> 34:04.258
I said stop!

34:10.340 --> 34:12.774
I'm going down, okay?

34:21.160 --> 34:23.811
John".

34:23.860 --> 34:25.828
what you think you're seeing...

34:25.860 --> 34:28.829
it isn't real.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.828
What you remember,
it isn't true.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.499
How do you know?
You weren't there.

34:33.530 --> 34:36.761
But you were, and you can
remember the truth, can't you?

34:36.800 --> 34:38.768
Richie died.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.732
They blew him up.

34:40.770 --> 34:44.774
But what happened
before the explosion?

34:44.810 --> 34:46.346
Richie...

34:46.380 --> 34:47.779
RICHIE: I got this.
...broke cover.

34:47.810 --> 34:49.175
Richie, get back here!

34:49.220 --> 34:50.619
I told him no,
but still, he broke cover.

34:50.650 --> 34:51.787
Why?

34:51.820 --> 34:53.811
Why would he do that?

34:53.850 --> 34:55.181
I don't know!

34:55.220 --> 34:57.256
Yes, you do.
You can,

34:57.290 --> 34:58.689
you have to remember.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.357
Why?

35:00.390 --> 35:03.393
Because it's the only way
you're gonna learn the truth.

35:05.330 --> 35:07.298
It happened to me...

35:07.330 --> 35:09.264
John, the same thing.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.234
I...

35:11.270 --> 35:13.306
I lost someone a long time ago.

35:13.340 --> 35:14.807
And I thought
I remembered

35:14.840 --> 35:18.503
what happened to them,
and I was wrong.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.914
I want you to look at it.
Just look back, okay?

35:24.950 --> 35:27.282
It's like, um...
watching a movie.

35:27.320 --> 35:28.878
You know, you just...

35:28.920 --> 35:31.252
You look at the images
on the screen... you just...

35:31.290 --> 35:32.427
look at them.

35:32.460 --> 35:33.586
I'm afraid.

35:33.630 --> 35:34.927
You don't have
to be afraid.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.325
It's just a memory.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.260
It can't hurt you anymore.

35:38.930 --> 35:40.659
Richie left his cover.

35:40.700 --> 35:42.668
Why did he leave his cover?

35:45.210 --> 35:46.837
CURTIS:
Richie, get back!

35:46.870 --> 35:48.838
CURTIS:
Damn, I'm thirsty.

35:48.880 --> 35:49.778
You thirsty?

35:49.810 --> 35:50.777
About as thirsty as I was

35:50.810 --> 35:51.640
two minutes ago when you asked.

35:51.680 --> 35:55.218
Man, this blows.
Where did those guys go?

35:55.250 --> 35:56.672
Be here soon.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.688
It's like the inside
of my mouth is all stuck.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.187
Don't got any water on you?

36:00.220 --> 36:02.381
There's no
more water, bro.

36:02.420 --> 36:03.682
But that's fine.

36:03.720 --> 36:04.880
Let's just ride it out.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.921
We'll be fine.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.869
You see this?
We got a local.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.765
Damn it, they're
not stopping.

36:31.650 --> 36:33.618
The road was closed.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.456
Our orders were not
to let anyone pass.

36:37.490 --> 36:39.378
Road's closed! Get back!

36:40.760 --> 36:41.897
Get back!

36:47.270 --> 36:48.965
What the hell are they doing?

36:49.000 --> 36:50.490
I don't know.
I'm gonna go check it out.

36:50.540 --> 36:51.768
No, no, no. We have
orders to stay put.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.869
Only Richie didn't listen.

36:53.910 --> 36:55.730
Just be cool, bro.
It's just two guys, okay?

36:55.780 --> 36:57.475
Richie, don't!
I got this.

36:57.510 --> 36:59.341
Richie!

37:00.480 --> 37:02.573
Richie, get back here!

37:02.620 --> 37:03.848
Richie, I'm serious!

37:05.690 --> 37:07.715
Why did Richie leave his cover?

37:07.750 --> 37:08.648
What happened?
I don't know.

37:08.690 --> 37:10.988
I swear, I swear,
I don't... I don't know.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.250
But he-he put... he...

37:13.290 --> 37:14.826
He put some guy on the ground.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.919
Richie, get back here!
I'm serious!

37:16.960 --> 37:18.769
Richie?!

37:26.010 --> 37:27.534
RICHIE: Hands up
where I can see 'em.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.877
And that's when it blew up.

37:33.910 --> 37:35.844
It blew up after that.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.019
No, you're wrong.

37:38.050 --> 37:41.349
What happened after
he put the guy on the ground?

37:41.390 --> 37:43.449
I told you, I don't know!

37:43.490 --> 37:47.051
He went back to the car,
and he leaned in the window.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.398
No.

37:48.430 --> 37:49.590
Yes.

37:49.630 --> 37:51.029
Yes, and then he looked at you.

37:51.060 --> 37:53.767
No!

38:01.580 --> 38:04.970
Richie!

38:05.010 --> 38:06.705
What are you seeing?

38:06.750 --> 38:07.978
No.

38:31.140 --> 38:33.563
N0

38:35.540 --> 38:36.734
No.

38:36.780 --> 38:38.998
N0

38:39.050 --> 38:41.109
It was water.

38:41.150 --> 38:43.971
He got me water.

38:44.020 --> 38:45.339
I wanted water.

38:45.390 --> 38:46.982
He went and got me
some water.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.784
Hey, John, it's not your fault.

38:49.820 --> 38:52.129
None of this
is your fault, okay?

38:52.160 --> 38:53.957
I'm sorry.

38:53.990 --> 38:55.992
I'm so sorry.

38:56.030 --> 38:57.793
On your knees!
Get down on your knees!

38:57.830 --> 38:58.797
Don't move.
Hands behind your head.

38:58.830 --> 39:00.889
You're gonna be okay.
All right?

39:00.930 --> 39:02.659
You were brave enough

39:02.700 --> 39:03.962
to remember and find the truth.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.002
You're gonna be okay,
I promise you.

39:19.150 --> 39:20.117
You okay?

39:20.150 --> 39:22.482
Yeah, I'm fine.

39:22.520 --> 39:23.657
Interesting decision,

39:23.690 --> 39:26.488
going in against a guy with
a bomb and a gun, unarmed.

39:26.530 --> 39:29.658
A big...big gun.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.053
Yeah, so I heard.

39:31.100 --> 39:33.989
Probably should have
called or something, huh?

39:34.030 --> 39:35.998
Yeah. Or an e-mail.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.598
Thought you should know,

39:37.640 --> 39:40.063
I'm putting you up
for a blue bar, Medal of Valor.

39:40.110 --> 39:42.999
That-that is... not necessary.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.702
That decision is
above your pay grade, Detective.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.604
Okay.

39:47.650 --> 39:49.845
Well, it's good
for fund

39:49.880 --> 39:51.939
Look, I'm trying
to build something special here,

39:51.990 --> 39:53.844
something we can
all be proud of,

39:53.890 --> 39:56.484
and tonight,
I could not be more proud.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.794
Medal of valor, huh?
I saw the memo.

40:01.830 --> 40:03.024
It's impressive.

40:03.060 --> 40:04.925
Yes, but it wasn't
my idea.
Mm-hmm.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.961
It was Eliot's idea.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.662
You realize what you did was
way outside the rule book.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.065
Yeah, I do.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.067
I'm beginning to realize,

40:12.110 --> 40:14.578
you sort of got your
own rule book, don't you?

40:14.610 --> 40:15.804
I do.

40:19.050 --> 40:23.111
I asked my guy at the FBI
if he could pull some strings

40:23.150 --> 40:25.744
to get Mrs. Sajadi and her kids
their green cards.

40:25.790 --> 40:27.439
Well, I have a feeling

40:27.490 --> 40:29.219
that's way outside
the rule book.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.887
Yup.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.128
Hi.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.923
Hey.

40:44.540 --> 40:46.508
Did you hear about my blue bar?

40:46.540 --> 40:48.701
I heard a rumor about that.

40:48.740 --> 40:50.571
Congratulations.

40:50.610 --> 40:51.975
What happens to Curtis now, Al?

40:54.010 --> 40:55.841
Four combat tours.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.677
That's a lot to ask of anyone,

40:57.720 --> 40:59.210
much less a 24 year old.

41:01.120 --> 41:03.611
I guess where there's life,
there's hope, huh?

41:03.660 --> 41:06.584
He watched his best friend die.

41:06.630 --> 41:07.824
Mm.

41:07.860 --> 41:09.896
Sometimes our worst memories
have a way

41:09.930 --> 41:11.625
of making us forget
our best ones, right?

41:11.670 --> 41:13.922
That does not seem
like a fair trade, does it?

41:13.970 --> 41:16.530
Speaking of...

41:16.570 --> 41:18.606
June 5, 1999.

41:18.640 --> 41:20.608
Really?

41:20.640 --> 41:22.278
A Saturday night, as I recall.

41:22.310 --> 41:24.130
Just... you should just
let this one go.

41:24.180 --> 41:26.808
That Murphy bed was actually
prettycomfortable.
Yeah.

41:26.850 --> 41:29.216
It was really comfortable
until you flipped it up

41:29.250 --> 41:31.514
into the wall
with us inside of it.

41:31.550 --> 41:32.778
Ouch.

41:32.820 --> 41:34.139
That's not what you said
at the time.

41:34.190 --> 41:35.657
That is what I said.

41:35.690 --> 41:37.009
Are you actually
challenging my memory?

41:37.060 --> 41:38.186
I'm challenging your memory.

41:38.220 --> 41:39.551
I said, "Ouch," and then...?

41:39.590 --> 41:41.182
Distinctly recall...
I recall something, too.

41:41.230 --> 41:42.720
A kind of yell.
