00:04.705 --> 00:06.340
Previously on ER:

00:06.374 --> 00:10.278
Joe, uh, fell and hit his head
in the park today.

00:10.311 --> 00:11.279
But he's awake now.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.247
We're at the hospital.

00:13.281 --> 00:16.384
It would be a lot easier
if I wasn't doing this alone.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.351
(cork pops)

00:20.121 --> 00:21.522
There's no ozone
in the tropics.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.723
Our skin
will melt off.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.193
Okay, enough.
You don't want to go.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.427
I'll go without you.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.761
You can check yourself
in the ICU.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.472
Greg. Greg,
wait up, wait up.

00:38.506 --> 00:39.807
Thyrotoxic crisis.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.476
You give propylthiouracil
or methimazole?

00:42.510 --> 00:44.845
You've got a patient
in thyroid storm?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.214
Go with PTU.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.848
What dose?
I'll look it up for you.

00:47.881 --> 00:48.782
(makes buzzer sound)...
600 migs.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.551
Then why'd you ask?

00:50.584 --> 00:52.820
Written boards are in a week.
Failure is not an option.

00:52.853 --> 00:54.755
If we quiz each other
every day, we'll nail it.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.424
Morris, if you don't know
your stuff by now,

00:56.457 --> 00:57.591
then you never will.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.160
MORRIS:
Did you see that?

00:59.193 --> 01:00.428
See what?

01:00.461 --> 01:02.296
That, that vixen,
the way she smiled at me.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.132
What are you
talking about?

01:04.165 --> 01:06.434
Yup. They all want a bite
of the forbidden fruit.
(scoffs)

01:06.467 --> 01:08.836
Seriously, at the coffee shop,
at the gym, at the bank,

01:08.869 --> 01:11.172
women are coming on
to me like crazy

01:11.205 --> 01:12.540
ever since Hope
gave me this ring.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.707
You and Hope
got engaged?

01:13.741 --> 01:15.509
No, no.
It's a promise ring.

01:15.543 --> 01:16.877
Yeah, what'd
you promise?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.546
To be faithful
while we're apart.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.314
Aw, that's sweet.
FRANK:
Or stupid.

01:20.348 --> 01:21.649
No, no. What's stupid is

01:21.682 --> 01:23.384
I should have put this ring on
years ago.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.186
Man, I could've tapped
so many hotties.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.320
Anybody seen Abby?

01:26.354 --> 01:28.222
No, she's not on
until 10:00.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.824
Alright, Morris,
belly-pain lady in 3.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.726
No, no. You got to keep me
away from the ladies.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.562
She's 85, man.
Perfect.

01:34.595 --> 01:35.729
GATES:
60%, 700cc's,
AC 14.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.198
Moretti's looking for you.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.233
I'm taking this guy
to the ICU.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.901
He's in the break room.
Well, he's going to have
to wait.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.670
He said it's important.
What the hell
does he want?

01:42.703 --> 01:44.238
Don't shoot
the messenger, geez.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.174
Alright,
I'll be right up.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.742
You summoned me?

01:48.776 --> 01:50.711
Ah, Dr. Gates...

01:50.744 --> 01:53.281
Look, I'm playing by your rules,
I'm doing my time upstairs.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.848
I don't know what else
I'm supposed to do.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.617
I spoke with
Dr. Shuster...

01:56.650 --> 01:58.719
Is this about my Coumadin
overdose with the GI bleed?

01:58.752 --> 02:00.621
No...
I ordered FFP.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.890
The blood bank was responsible
for the delay, not me.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.259
Well, I'm not familiar
with that case, but...

02:05.293 --> 02:06.360
Pneumothorax on the COPDer?

02:06.394 --> 02:08.196
Even the radiologist missed it.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.597
Alright, Dr. Gates...

02:09.630 --> 02:11.665
When the guy deteriorated,
I had the chest tube in

02:11.699 --> 02:13.501
even before
they processed the film.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.203
Dr. Gates, if, if I might?

02:15.236 --> 02:16.404
Go ahead. What?

02:16.437 --> 02:18.539
Okay. I just wanted
to congratulate you

02:18.572 --> 02:20.408
on your fine work
in the ICU.

02:20.441 --> 02:23.211
You do?

02:23.244 --> 02:24.645
Yes. Dr. Shuster has given you
rave reviews

02:24.678 --> 02:26.347
for your performance.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.249
She did?

02:28.282 --> 02:31.352
Yep. And I think you're ready
to come back to the ER.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.721
I am?

02:33.754 --> 02:36.824
Really?

02:36.857 --> 02:37.858
Yes.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.696
Okay.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.533
Alright.

02:45.566 --> 02:46.700
Then I'll,
uh, you know what?

02:46.734 --> 02:48.536
I'll finish up my work
this week...

02:48.569 --> 02:49.970
Well, you do whatever
you have to do,

02:50.003 --> 02:51.672
but I want you back
on the floor today.

02:51.705 --> 02:52.873
Today?

02:57.345 --> 03:00.248
Alright. Thank you.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.853
This was supposed to be
a simple bowel resection.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.388
I never should have
promised his kid

03:07.421 --> 03:08.556
he'd make it
to the Packers game.

03:08.589 --> 03:09.857
The family here?

03:09.890 --> 03:11.859
Yeah, there's a son,
uh, named Jeremy.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.594
He just drove up
from Notre Dame.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.563
Great.

03:20.401 --> 03:23.271
Hello, I'm Dr. Rasgotra.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.339
Hi, yeah,
I've been waiting for you.

03:25.373 --> 03:26.874
Surgery took a little
longer than expected.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.742
That's okay.
I was fine here.

03:28.776 --> 03:31.979
There were some...
complications, I'm afraid.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.381
Sorry to hear that.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.448
Would you like
to sit down?

03:34.482 --> 03:36.584
No, I'm good.

03:36.617 --> 03:40.388
Well, during surgery, we think
he suffered a heart attack.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.455
Really?

03:41.489 --> 03:42.990
Yeah. He's on a ventilator

03:43.023 --> 03:46.294
and IV meds to maintain
his blood pressure.

03:46.294 --> 03:49.863
Oh, man,
that's never good.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.565
Are you alright?

03:51.599 --> 03:53.701
I got to admit,
I'm a bit little nervous,

03:53.734 --> 03:57.505
but I am really, really,
psyched to be here.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.374
Your father's
in critical condition.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.876
What?
Oh, no. No, he's not.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.845
I don't think
you understand...

04:04.878 --> 04:07.515
Actually, I do...
Jeremy, this is
very serious...

04:07.548 --> 04:09.883
Listen. My name is
Harold Zelinsky.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.919
My father died ten years ago.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.721
I'm your new intern.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.855
You are?

04:14.888 --> 04:15.856
Uh-huh.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.625
Excuse me.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.493
Do you have any news
about my dad?

04:32.373 --> 04:35.343
(baby crying)

04:40.648 --> 04:43.784
(crying continuing)
(phone rings)

04:47.755 --> 04:50.924
Hello?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.460
Oh, hey, Luka.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.094
No, I'm, I'm awake.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.763
(crying continuing)

04:55.796 --> 04:56.897
KOVAC:
I've been calling
for three hours.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.932
ABBY:
I was exhausted,

04:58.966 --> 05:01.068
so I, um, took the ringer off
so I could get some sleep.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.069
Is that Joe?

05:02.102 --> 05:04.538
Yeah.
So he's okay now?

05:04.572 --> 05:05.606
Yeah, he just woke up.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.041
Hi, baby.
Good morning.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.777
I'm sorry
I wasn't around.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.912
We got stuck
at the hospital.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.682
(Joe crying)
(machine buzzing loudly)

05:14.715 --> 05:16.417
I tried calling you at work.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.019
They filled me in.
Told me his MRI was normal.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.988
Yeah, yeah. He's fine.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.457
(both speaking in Croatian)

05:26.860 --> 05:28.095
Sorry.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.097
With, uh,
with the spinal fracture,

05:30.130 --> 05:34.001
even after surgery,
my dad can't move his legs.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.703
So when he gets home,

05:35.736 --> 05:38.472
he'll have to get around
in a wheelchair.

05:38.506 --> 05:41.509
We're building ramps
for the steps

05:41.542 --> 05:42.876
and handrails
for the bathroom...

05:42.910 --> 05:44.812
Yeah. How soon can
you fly home?

05:44.845 --> 05:45.979
We need to fix up
the house.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.749
It's a lot of work.

05:48.782 --> 05:49.983
You could just call the airline

05:50.017 --> 05:52.453
and just get
on the standby flight.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.021
Right?
Abby...

05:54.054 --> 05:55.856
And I'm sure
there's a seat available...

05:55.889 --> 05:58.659
I'm sorry, but it's going to be
at least another week.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.760
Another week?!

05:59.793 --> 06:01.429
Luka, Luka...
(Joe crying)

06:01.462 --> 06:03.063
Why can't your brother
just finish up?

06:03.096 --> 06:05.966
Hey, I know you don't like it.
I don't like it either.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.835
But I need to do this. Okay?

06:07.868 --> 06:10.838
Please...
just don't make it harder.

06:10.871 --> 06:15.643
(Joe crying)

06:15.676 --> 06:17.611
Okay.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.983
Okay, but we miss you.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.085
I miss you too.

06:25.118 --> 06:28.589
We miss you a lot.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.558
Alright, let's set up
for irrigation.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.025
I'll come back once
the skin is numbed up.

06:32.059 --> 06:35.696
Serum osmolality
calculation.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.865
Serum "ozzims?"

06:37.898 --> 06:39.967
Two times sodium,
plus glucose over 18,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.201
plus B.U.N. over 2.8.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.936
Way to go.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.105
FRANK:
Morris, somebody's
waiting for you.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.540
You see
what I'm talking about?

06:46.574 --> 06:48.542
Here's the Levaquin
you ordered.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.911
So you came to drop off
an antibiotic?

06:50.944 --> 06:52.179
Sorry, Dr. Morris,
I can't say

06:52.212 --> 06:53.747
that I agree
with your assessment.

06:53.781 --> 06:56.584
And you're invited
to my opening.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.519
Your... opening?

06:58.552 --> 07:01.121
Pharmacy's my day job,
but sculpture's my passion.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.491
I do a lot of figures,
mainly nudes.

07:03.491 --> 07:04.658
You like art?

07:04.692 --> 07:06.527
Uh, I love it.
Uh, you know what?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.562
I'm going to put this up
in the lounge in case

07:08.596 --> 07:09.897
anyone's interested.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.632
No, this invitation's
just for you.

07:15.235 --> 07:18.706
Assess that, Dr. Pratt.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.508
County General
on 2-B.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.876
RASGOTRA:
Dr. Morris and Pratt
are the attendings.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.044
Frank is the grouchy clerk.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.514
This is Harold Zelinsky,
my new intern.

07:26.514 --> 07:27.848
Neela,
don't go far.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.249
We've got two car crash victims
en route.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.518
Grab your coat from
the second floor,

07:30.551 --> 07:31.752
meet me
outside Trauma.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.986
Oh! It's going
to be awesome

07:33.020 --> 07:35.989
working with you guys.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.124
That kid's an intern?

07:37.157 --> 07:38.759
What is he like, 12?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.060
They keep
getting younger.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.194
Or we keep
getting older.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.229
Looks like he's
in high school.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.532
I asked.
He said he was 25.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.099
No way.
He's lying.

07:46.133 --> 07:50.638
First one to verify his age
wins the pot. Who's in?

07:50.671 --> 07:51.739
I'm with that.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.908
GATES:
What do you got?

07:54.942 --> 07:56.544
Bevan Guang, driver of
a solo car versus utility pole.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.646
I'm Dr. Gates.
Do you remember what happened?

07:58.679 --> 07:59.580
Not really.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.081
WOMAN:
I do.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.551
He fell asleep at the wheel
and went off the road.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.252
Traci Martinez,
front-seat passenger.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.554
I didn't fall asleep.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.788
Are you okay, baby?

08:07.821 --> 08:10.057
I think so.
How about you?

08:10.090 --> 08:11.291
I'm okay.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.660
Any neck pain,
chest pain?

08:12.693 --> 08:14.562
Dr. Gates,
back in the saddle, huh?

08:14.562 --> 08:16.564
Yep. Possible syncope
at the wheel.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.065
TRACI:
He works all night
at a warehouse.

08:18.098 --> 08:21.234
GATES:
Wiggle your toes for me.
Good. Now squeeze my hand.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.936
I should have been driving.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.305
I don't like you driving
when you're pregnant.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.575
Congratulations.
How far along are you?

08:27.608 --> 08:28.241
20 weeks.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.643
I got this.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.144
No, I got it.
No, I'm good.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.645
Were you wearing
your seat belt?

08:32.679 --> 08:33.947
Always.
Great.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.182
We'll check
you and the baby out,

08:35.215 --> 08:36.884
make sure everybody's healthy.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.885
The success or failure of
your interns depends on you.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.287
I'm looking forward
to being a good mentor.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.955
No, no, not a mentor.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.323
You're not their friend,
you're their taskmaster.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.792
They need to be whipped.

08:44.825 --> 08:45.959
Yeah, well, that's
not quite my style.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.628
You should make it
your style then.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.096
Fear is what motivates them
to learn and excel.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.631
They should hate you.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.132
Well, you know,
I think there are other ways...

08:52.165 --> 08:54.835
It's worked for decades
of surgical training.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.638
You need to be Lou Gossett
to their Richard Gere.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.840
You're from
Connecticut, right?
Yeah.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.341
There are only two things
that come out of Connecticut:

09:01.374 --> 09:02.910
steers and queers.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.044
Which one are you, boy?

09:04.077 --> 09:05.913
I don't see no horns.

09:08.281 --> 09:12.119
Doesn't quite work
with Connecticut.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.887
I'm not joking, Neela.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.989
Without discipline,
interns screw up.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.991
And if he screws up,
you screw up.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.359
You want your
first-choice elective?

09:19.392 --> 09:21.061
Bring him to his knees.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.000
(gruffly):
What have we got,
Zelinsky?

09:27.034 --> 09:28.669
I thought I was supposed
to wait out here for you

09:28.702 --> 09:29.903
before I went in.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.304
Do you know what it means
to be proactive?

09:31.338 --> 09:33.040
You could be halfway
through your assessment by now.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.341
But you...
Next time,
get right on it.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.076
Am I understood?
Where are we?

09:36.109 --> 09:38.178
Uh, good vitals,
no obvious injuries.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.781
First crit is 39.
Very stable.
Is this your
new intern?

09:40.814 --> 09:43.651
Harold Zelinsky, Nurse
Marquez, Dr. Lockhart.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.018
Hello.
Hello.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.654
Hi. I'm Dr. Rasgotra
from Surgery.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.756
Nice to meet you.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.859
Okay, uh, fetal Doppler
and Surgilube.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.160
Is there anything
I can do to help?

09:53.193 --> 09:55.863
RASGOTRA:
No, just stand back and observe.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.665
So, Harold, how do
you like your iPod?

09:57.698 --> 09:58.899
Yeah, it's cool.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.100
Abdomen's soft
and non-tender.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.201
I remember
when you had to go

10:01.234 --> 10:03.136
to the record store
to buy music.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.638
I bought my first CD
when I was ten.

10:04.672 --> 10:05.773
MARQUEZ:
Sonosite's ready.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.174
So when was that,
like mid-'90s?

10:07.207 --> 10:09.342
Eminem, huh?
He wasn't around yet.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.345
Right, right. Probably, uh,
Spice Girls then?

10:12.379 --> 10:14.281
Mozart Clarinet
Concerto in A Major,

10:14.314 --> 10:16.049
Richard Stoltzman,
soloist.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.184
Dr. Zelinsky,
take a look.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.318
You might learn something.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.353
No abruption.
That's good?

10:20.387 --> 10:22.155
Very good.

10:22.189 --> 10:27.294
Okay, serial crits, fetal
monitor, and send off a, um...

10:27.327 --> 10:28.261
A what?

10:28.295 --> 10:30.097
You know...

10:31.331 --> 10:33.433
The test, the test,
for, for, for...

10:33.466 --> 10:34.668
fetal-maternal blood exchange.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.336
Kleihauer-Betke.
Right.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.438
RASGOTRA:
No evidence of previa.
Type and R.H. to the blood bank.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.140
Are you alright?

10:40.173 --> 10:43.143
Yeah, I was just up all night
with a bad stomach.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.377
It's probably a virus.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.246
So what do you need,
an IV?
No.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.781
Why don't you go take a nap,
get some rest?

10:47.815 --> 10:49.282
No, it's alright.
I just need...

10:49.316 --> 10:52.786
Look, it's slow right now.
Go, before we get slammed.

10:52.820 --> 10:53.420
Really?

10:53.453 --> 10:54.955
Yeah, go.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.794
What are you doing?

11:00.828 --> 11:02.930
Just taking this off
for the x-ray.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.799
Please, don't lose it.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.935
It was my grandma's.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.437
C-spine's clear,
let's sit him up.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.005
Do you want
cardiac enzymes?
No.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.173
How about a head CT?

11:13.206 --> 11:15.943
No. No headache,
no focal findings.

11:15.976 --> 11:19.279
(Bevan groans)

11:19.312 --> 11:21.081
I forgot to eat breakfast.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.750
Maybe that's why I got dizzy.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.852
Well, you've got a lot
on your mind.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.787
Boy or a girl?

11:26.820 --> 11:29.222
We want
to be surprised.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.190
You got kids?

11:30.223 --> 11:32.159
Yeah, I have
a little girl.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.894
She doesn't live
with me, but...

11:33.927 --> 11:35.963
Okay if I send him
to get a chest x-ray?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.464
That's up to Dr. Gates.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.800
We'll get a better film
in Radiology.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.368
You know what?
Let's leave him here.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.870
If it's simple fainting,

11:42.903 --> 11:44.371
symptoms could last
a couple minutes.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.173
His dizziness only lasted
a few seconds.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.474
That could indicate
a dangerous cardiac arrhythmia.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.376
Valid point.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.278
I've got something
dangerous?

11:51.311 --> 11:53.480
Probably not, but we're going
to keep you on a heart monitor.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.348
Give you another listen, huh?

11:55.382 --> 11:57.250
Anybody seen the Wood's lamp?
TAGGART:
Nope.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.186
Are you still okay?
TRACI:
Yeah.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.420
You know what?

12:00.453 --> 12:02.089
You're working too hard.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.190
How's the baby?
Okay.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.391
Shh.
They did an ultrasound?

12:04.424 --> 12:06.093
Yeah, they did.
We'll let you guys

12:06.126 --> 12:07.294
chat in a
minute, okay?

12:07.327 --> 12:08.796
TAGGART:
Come on, lie down
and relax.

12:09.863 --> 12:12.432
I don't feel so good.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.135
(alarm beeping)
V tach!

12:15.168 --> 12:16.203
Bevan!
Bevan!

12:16.236 --> 12:17.370
Unresponsive.
No pulse.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.505
Charge to 360.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.940
Everyone clear?

12:22.876 --> 12:25.012
(beeping)

12:25.045 --> 12:27.915
Okay, back in sinus.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.049
He's a healthy 22-year-old.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.388
You need me?

12:35.422 --> 12:38.125
No, just the Wood's lamp.

12:38.158 --> 12:41.061
Sorry. I'll put up a
"do not disturb" sign.

12:41.094 --> 12:41.561
Thank you.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.063
Mm-hmm.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.412
(sighing)

13:11.424 --> 13:13.460
No ectopy
on lidocaine.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.363
Is this going
to keep happening?

13:16.396 --> 13:17.497
I don't know.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.133
You ever have
chest pain?

13:20.167 --> 13:22.135
Your father
have heart disease?

13:22.169 --> 13:25.005
No.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.506
Any drug use?

13:30.577 --> 13:32.412
(sighs)

13:32.445 --> 13:34.414
Look...

13:34.447 --> 13:36.984
we live in a studio apartment.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.986
I'm trying to save up
for a two-bedroom

13:39.019 --> 13:40.520
before the baby comes.

13:40.553 --> 13:43.123
I work at a print shop,

13:43.156 --> 13:46.193
then pull the graveyard
at a furniture warehouse.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.528
So, you took something
to stay awake.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.297
Couple a nights ago,
I took a pill.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.132
Like speed?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.000
I don't know.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.301
My friend gave it to me.

13:56.603 --> 13:59.106
You think it messed up my heart?

13:59.139 --> 14:00.607
You know, it probably
wasn't that.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.911
Your, uh, EKG has
a different kind of abnormality.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.946
It could be a condition
that you were born with.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.280
You want to tell
Cardiology to come down?

14:07.314 --> 14:09.917
Yeah.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.255
I want to be a good dad.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.223
I'm trying.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.527
I'm really trying.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.199
Harold?

14:26.233 --> 14:27.500
Hey, uh,
Security needs

14:27.534 --> 14:30.103
a-a photocopy of
your driver's license.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.105
I don't have one.
You don't?

14:32.139 --> 14:33.406
I took driver's ed
in high school.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.642
I never got around
to taking the test, though.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.277
Uh, Dr. Rasgotra's
waiting for this.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.946
If you don't have
a driver's license,

14:38.946 --> 14:39.412
how do you... how
do you get places?

14:39.446 --> 14:40.680
I take the El.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.116
If the weather's good,
I ride my bike.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.952
Do you want a copy
of my hospital ID?

14:44.952 --> 14:47.220
No, no, I'll talk
to the authorities.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.256
Find out
what we need.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.690
Repeat crit
is 38.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.525
You figure
it out?
No, he's crafty.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.127
Dr. Zelinsky,
your progress notes

14:54.161 --> 14:55.062
and dressing changes?

14:55.095 --> 14:56.196
They're all done.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.966
Does that baby have ascites?

14:58.966 --> 15:00.367
We're focusing on the placenta.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.635
Looks like
pleural effusions, too.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.104
I think you're right...

15:04.137 --> 15:05.572
in the way of my screen.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.474
Step back, please.

15:07.507 --> 15:08.241
What's-What's wrong?

15:08.275 --> 15:09.342
Is my baby okay?

15:09.376 --> 15:11.011
No. The heart's beating well.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.645
It could be isoimmunization
if mom's Rh-negative...

15:12.679 --> 15:13.646
She's Rh-positive.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.348
What are you talking about?

15:15.382 --> 15:17.584
There are some
fluid collections.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.186
Are you with children a lot?

15:19.219 --> 15:20.220
I teach preschool.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.454
Dr. Zelinsky, can you page OB?

15:21.488 --> 15:22.422
If the kids gave her a virus...

15:22.455 --> 15:23.390
I get colds all the time.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.125
20% of hydrops is caused

15:25.158 --> 15:26.493
by parvo or fifth disease.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.461
It's a common infection
amongst toddlers.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.629
Is that serious?

15:29.662 --> 15:31.298
There's increased risk
of fetal

15:31.331 --> 15:33.466
abnormalities and miscarriage.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.467
(sobbing)
Oh, my God.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.136
HAROLD:
Parvo is one

15:36.169 --> 15:38.705
of the few treatable etiologies
of hydrops fetalis,

15:38.738 --> 15:41.008
so actually, you're
pretty lucky if that's it.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.010
Harold...
Lucky?

15:43.043 --> 15:44.577
He just said
I could lose my baby.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.612
HAROLD:
Oh, no, no.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.180
Not with a UV
transfusion.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.717
Look... I know
this is hard,

15:50.750 --> 15:53.053
but we're going to do
everything we can

15:53.086 --> 15:55.222
to help you and
your baby, okay?

15:55.255 --> 15:57.024
(sighs)

16:01.628 --> 16:03.730
Vincent Greco,
skin infection.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.266
I got two boils--
here, here.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.468
Okay, um,

16:08.501 --> 16:09.536
how long
have you had them?

16:09.569 --> 16:10.637
About a week.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.572
Started out
like a pimple.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.108
Tried hot compresses,
but they just kept growing.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.776
Mm-hmm, and do you
work out a lot?

16:16.809 --> 16:19.046
Yeah, I'm a
personal trainer.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.714
Uh-huh, well,
gyms have nasty germs.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.083
It looks like
I'm going to have to open...

16:23.116 --> 16:24.251
Sorry.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.486
Did you have a nice nap,
Dr. Lockhart?

16:26.519 --> 16:27.554
Yes, thank you.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.156
Dr. Moretti,
can you tell me

16:29.189 --> 16:30.623
why Gates has two patients
on the board?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.192
Yeah, he got stuck
with a V tach arrest.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.793
Well, is the patient
in V tach right now?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.562
Cardiology is
on their way.
Well, good.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.364
Then he can come down
and pitch in.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.167
No, I think there is benefit
to his staying with the patient.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.501
Greg, you have something
to ask me?

16:41.534 --> 16:43.403
No. Oh, right,
the boards.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.239
Uh... I don't know.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.075
Antidote for aspirin
overdose is what?

16:48.108 --> 16:49.642
Come on, you call
that a question?

16:49.676 --> 16:50.643
Okay, new-new deal.
New deal.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.245
From now on,
tough questions,

16:52.279 --> 16:54.114
and only when we're...
when we're stressed.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.782
That'll recreate
the anxiety of test day.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.118
Come on, Morris.
Let me check some labs.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.319
Okay.
"IceColdShower.com?"

16:59.352 --> 17:00.620
What the hell
is that?

17:00.653 --> 17:02.522
I'm ordering
herbal anaphrodisiacs.

17:02.555 --> 17:03.723
You need
aphrodisiacs?

17:03.756 --> 17:05.558
No, no, no.
Anaphrodisiacs.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.795
"Curbs your libido and puts
the brakes on sexual energy.

17:08.828 --> 17:12.132
These tablets ensure
a lust-free day."

17:12.165 --> 17:13.733
Come on, you've seen
what's happening, guys, huh?

17:13.766 --> 17:14.733
I need this stuff.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.236
You want
to lose your libido,

17:16.269 --> 17:18.738
get married
and have a kid.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.640
Well, I'm impressed.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.109
It usually takes an OB
to pick up hydrops.

17:23.109 --> 17:24.477
It was not tough
to diagnose.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.512
Ascites was a
clear tip-off.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.416
Traci, this is
Dr. Coburn from OB.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.717
Hi.
Hi.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.352
Your blood test
shows you had a recent

17:32.385 --> 17:34.554
parvovirus infection.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.189
I had a bad cold
in August.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.590
That was it.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.392
Well, we're concerned
about the possible effects

17:39.426 --> 17:41.394
of the infection
in your baby's bone marrow.

17:41.428 --> 17:45.132
COBURN:
Blood velocity in the brain
is 44 centimeters per second.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.200
That is not what
we were hoping for.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.236
Indicates
a severe anemia.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.470
But I went to the clinic
last week.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.738
My blood count was fine.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.706
You're not anemic.
Your baby is.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.708
COBURN:
So, we need to give

17:55.742 --> 17:58.345
a transfusion directly
into the umbilical cord.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.147
Are you sure?

18:00.147 --> 18:01.581
Without it, there's
a serious risk of fetal death.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.383
(sotto voce):
70%.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.419
With it, there's a very high
probability of a cure.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.420
(sotto voce):
90%.

18:08.555 --> 18:09.722
You want to stick

18:09.756 --> 18:11.158
a needle in the umbilical cord?

18:11.191 --> 18:13.293
COBURN:
It's the only way to help.

18:13.326 --> 18:16.463
Although there is a slight
possibility of a miscarriage.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.530
Seven percent.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.567
Well, just look
at the numbers.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.870
The benefits outweigh the risks
by a factor of 12.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.305
I want to talk to Bevan.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.507
He's, uh, with the cardiologist.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.708
Can he be here when you do it?

18:28.741 --> 18:31.544
If it's okay
with Dr. Kayson.

18:31.578 --> 18:32.479
I need him with me.

18:32.512 --> 18:33.646
COBURN:
Okay.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.781
I'll go get
things set up.

18:34.814 --> 18:35.848
Okay.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.684
Uh, Dr. Zelinsky
will assist you.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.496
TRACI:
When I first
found out...

18:51.231 --> 18:53.433
I wasn't sure
I wanted the baby.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.303
But then Bevan stepped up.

18:56.336 --> 18:59.639
He said we could do it
together.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.308
It made us closer.

19:05.245 --> 19:08.515
Everything was really good.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.717
It can still be good.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.253
I thought it was a blessing
getting pregnant.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.426
Now I'm not so sure.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.295
(sighs)

19:23.896 --> 19:25.332
LOCKHART:
Is it sharp here?

19:25.365 --> 19:26.599
VINCENT:
Can't feel a thing.

19:26.633 --> 19:29.402
Alright, let me know
if anything hurts.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.839
That's a lot of pus.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.407
Good thing I came in.

19:34.441 --> 19:39.246
Smells anaerobic.
You want a wound culture?

19:39.279 --> 19:40.513
Jin Kim?

19:40.547 --> 19:42.515
WOMAN:
Right here.

19:43.716 --> 19:47.820
Are you going
to be my doctor?

19:47.854 --> 19:50.290
Nope. Actually, no.
No, I'm not.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.694
(whimpers)

20:01.468 --> 20:03.636
MORRIS:
Dr. Lockhart,
can I take over, please?

20:03.670 --> 20:05.605
There's a lady with foot pain
in Exam 2 I need you to see.

20:05.638 --> 20:08.575
Sounds good.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.443
(sighs)

20:10.477 --> 20:11.911
Heart sounds good.

20:11.944 --> 20:16.249
EKG shows S-T segment elevation
in V one, two and three.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.717
I'm thinking
Brugada syndrome.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.953
Hmm.

20:20.987 --> 20:21.921
What?

20:21.954 --> 20:23.390
Dr. Gates will be back

20:23.423 --> 20:24.757
to discuss all
of my recommendations.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.429
Please, can I go in
with Traci?

20:29.462 --> 20:31.698
Yeah, as soon as I get back.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.501
It's not Brugada.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.403
Ventricular arrhythmia
in an Asian man,

20:36.436 --> 20:38.305
classic EKG findings?

20:38.338 --> 20:41.341
That's not S-T elevation.
It's early repolarization.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.609
How do you explain the V tach?

20:42.642 --> 20:44.644
Gee, maybe it has
something to do

20:44.677 --> 20:47.880
with the amphetamines
in his urine.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.682
Alright, he took a pill
three days ago,

20:49.716 --> 20:51.384
but nothing since then.

20:51.418 --> 20:54.287
And every drunk with an ETOH
of 500 only had two beers.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.588
Repeat his
cardiac enzymes.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.457
If they're negative,
I'll clear him

20:57.490 --> 20:59.392
for discharge,
or jail for DUI.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.727
He had a cardiac arrest.
From the amphetamines.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.995
And you don't think
it can happen again?

21:03.029 --> 21:04.531
Not unless he takes more drugs.

21:04.564 --> 21:05.965
Well, I disagree
with you.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.834
If it's Brugada, it
could happen anytime.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.836
I think he needs an
implantable defibrillator.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.070
Well, let's continue
this discussion

21:11.103 --> 21:12.739
after you complete
a Cardiology fellowship.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.674
This is... This is
a good guy here.

21:14.707 --> 21:15.942
MARQUEZ:
Excuse me.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.710
Why are you
writing him off?
I'm not.

21:17.744 --> 21:18.911
He's had eight hours
of normal monitoring.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.347
I don't think that's enough.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.748
I think you need
to keep him in overnight.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.949
Don't tell me how
to practice medicine.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.452
I am not admitting
a speed freak.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.519
Can you hold it down?

21:28.555 --> 21:30.657
It was a mistake,
a one-time thing.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.460
(loudly):
A kid who's popping amphetamines
doesn't need the CCU.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.394
He needs rehab.

21:34.427 --> 21:35.728
And you had better learn

21:35.762 --> 21:37.096
to take the advice
of a senior consultant

21:37.129 --> 21:39.832
if you intend on finishing
your residency.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.086
Uh, any more pain,
Mr. Greco?

22:00.119 --> 22:01.554
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

22:01.588 --> 22:02.922
Dr. Morris, my
daughter, Layna.

22:02.955 --> 22:04.724
WOMAN:
Hey.
Hi.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.394
Uh... he needs
to be admitted

22:07.394 --> 22:12.932
to the IV antibiotics
for the hospital.

22:12.965 --> 22:16.102
I mean... Uh... you know...
you know what I mean.

22:16.135 --> 22:18.405
Let's get a dressing on this.

22:18.405 --> 22:19.806
It looks pretty bad.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.008
It's not that
flesh-eating
bacteria, is it?

22:22.041 --> 22:23.943
No, No, this'll clear up
in a few days.

22:23.976 --> 22:26.045
Thank God.
I've got your Clinda.

22:26.078 --> 22:28.047
Are we out of kerlix?

22:28.080 --> 22:29.048
I don't think so.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.584
So, Doctor, may I ask,

22:31.618 --> 22:33.720
what kind of car
do you drive?

22:33.753 --> 22:35.822
Uh, yeah. BMW 328.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.558
Not bad, but I'd love
to see you in Z-4.

22:38.591 --> 22:39.792
I sell luxury cars,

22:39.826 --> 22:41.828
and a man like you
deserves something sexy.

22:41.861 --> 22:42.995
(laughs)

22:43.029 --> 22:45.732
Uh, anything else,
Dr. Morris?

22:45.765 --> 22:47.834
Some tape.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.436
So, what's your wife in?

22:49.436 --> 22:52.439
Well, actually, I'm-I'm

22:52.472 --> 22:53.105
(whispers):
not married.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.707
Oh, really?

22:54.741 --> 22:56.776
So, the ring's just
to sweeten the pot?

22:56.809 --> 22:58.445
All we have
is three-inch.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.112
I've heard you can
make that work.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.784
GATES:
Hey, Sam, where'd you
move the boyfriend?

23:04.817 --> 23:05.985
Bevan Guang.
Exam 3 with Chuny.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.487
We're still waiting
on troponins.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.555
Oh, we still
have time.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.089
Will you talk
to Kayson?

23:10.122 --> 23:12.091
You want me to override
the Chief of Cardiology

23:12.124 --> 23:12.725
and demand admission?

23:12.759 --> 23:14.461
Yeah.

23:14.494 --> 23:17.029
We have to think about working
with Dr. Kayson in the future.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.865
We have to think
about saving lives now.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.967
Well, sometimes you have
to defer to the consultants.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.503
Yeah, well, what
if they're wrong?
Get creative.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.472
BEVAN:
Could the needle hurt the baby?

23:25.472 --> 23:26.773
There's a small chance,

23:26.806 --> 23:28.641
but Traci wants to
have the transfusion.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.577
She decided
on her own?
Mm-hmm.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.579
Can I talk to her about it?

23:32.612 --> 23:36.182
Uh, I don't think she
wants to see you right now.

23:36.215 --> 23:39.686
Because of the speed?

23:39.719 --> 23:42.054
It was only once.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.923
It's not like
I'm a tweaker or-or...

23:43.956 --> 23:47.960
She's a little
disappointed.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.930
TRACI:
I won't listen
to his crap anymore.

23:50.963 --> 23:53.866
I should have known.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.768
(sighs)

23:55.802 --> 23:57.236
He used to deejay
at warehouse parties.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.605
He'd be out all night
with his boys.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.006
I thought he was
different now.

24:00.039 --> 24:03.042
I think he is.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.811
He lied to me.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.245
He was, like, "I'm
going to work hard

24:06.278 --> 24:08.815
and support you and the baby
and be a good dad..."

24:08.848 --> 24:09.949
He's trying to step up.
He's trying to step up, Traci.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.584
By getting high?

24:11.618 --> 24:13.886
By almost getting
us killed?

24:13.920 --> 24:16.556
People change, Traci.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.825
I used to get high all the time.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.527
Made a lot of dumb mistakes.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.695
But I straightened out
when it mattered.

24:22.729 --> 24:24.697
He's not like that.

24:24.731 --> 24:25.732
He proved it.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.600
He messed up.

24:27.634 --> 24:30.937
You know, sometimes things
aren't always right or wrong

24:30.970 --> 24:33.540
or black or white.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.549
My baby's sick.

24:42.549 --> 24:45.752
Might not even make it.

24:45.785 --> 24:48.087
Can we not talk about this
right now?

24:49.989 --> 24:52.825
Okay.

24:54.761 --> 24:57.630
Okay.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.608
You look, uh,
very lost.

25:08.641 --> 25:11.143
Um, yeah, I'm looking
for Traci Martinez.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.579
They pointed me
in this direction.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.180
They said she was
in Trauma 1.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.949
Yes, I'm Dr. Gates,
and the good news is

25:16.983 --> 25:19.786
you are very, very warm
'cause Trauma 1
is right there.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.253
(sighs)
Thank you.

25:21.287 --> 25:22.855
So are you a friend?

25:22.889 --> 25:24.023
Um, not exactly.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.092
Julia Dupree.
Ah.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.860
I'm the on-call chaplain.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.963
Right.

25:30.997 --> 25:32.732
Oh, so they called you
for a consultation?

25:32.765 --> 25:34.200
Yeah.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.636
Good. Well, listen,
I'm very familiar with the case,

25:36.669 --> 25:38.871
so, um, if you have
any questions...

25:40.006 --> 25:42.108
No, I think I can manage.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.776
Thank you, Doctor.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.878
Gates.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.019
(clanging nearby)
The nerve gets, uh,

25:53.052 --> 25:54.954
compressed and inflamed
right here.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.689
So what do we do?

25:56.723 --> 25:59.325
There's a pad for your arch,
but you're going to have

25:59.358 --> 26:01.160
to stop with the high heels
for a few months.

26:01.193 --> 26:03.129
Are you serious?
I'm sorry.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.931
Can you, can you
make her stop doing that?

26:04.964 --> 26:06.833
She's expressing
her frustration.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.301
Yes, well, so am I.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.270
Emily, give that to Mommy.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.640
(Emily shrieking)
I'll be right back.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.844
(shrieking continues)

26:19.378 --> 26:22.148
Your lady
has a Morton's neuroma.

26:22.181 --> 26:25.151
Oh, I figured. Thanks.

26:25.184 --> 26:27.887
Well, looks like further surgery
won't be necessary.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.088
Mm.
How's it going, Dad?

26:29.121 --> 26:30.657
Ah, much better,
sweetheart.

26:30.657 --> 26:32.058
Thank you.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.360
This guy...
guy's the best.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.764
You ever been inside a Shelby?

26:37.797 --> 26:41.033
Those are some
tight little numbers.

26:41.067 --> 26:42.735
Didn't we talk about this?

26:42.769 --> 26:44.804
I mean, I was perfectly clear
about my situation.

26:44.837 --> 26:45.905
What situation?

26:45.938 --> 26:47.039
Hey, Sophia.
Hey.

26:47.073 --> 26:50.042
I see you've met
my sister?

26:50.076 --> 26:51.778
Twins?

26:51.811 --> 26:54.346
We were hoping we could
take you out for a test drive.

26:54.380 --> 26:57.349
So... you two work together?

26:57.383 --> 26:58.818
We do everything together.
We do everything together.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.687
(whimpers)

27:00.720 --> 27:02.421
COBURN:
Advancing the needle.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.390
TRACI:
When my friends had babies,

27:04.423 --> 27:07.159
they were all so happy.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.028
I thought I could handle it.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.763
It's okay
to be afraid.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.699
I'd be scared
out of my mind.

27:12.699 --> 27:14.767
(sobbing):
I'm not strong enough
to do this alone.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.936
Hey, I think you might
surprise yourself.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.437
RASGOTRA:
There's the tip.
I'm not so sure.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.206
TAGGART:
Really shows up.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.708
Do you want to say
a prayer?

27:21.708 --> 27:22.809
COBURN:
It's etched, echo tipped.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.076
We can do it together.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.412
Go to the right,
toward Mom's feet.

27:26.445 --> 27:27.980
There's the cord.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.215
TAGGART:
Packed cells and
platelets are up.

27:29.248 --> 27:30.717
HAROLD:
How big is the umbilical vein?

27:30.750 --> 27:32.719
At 20 weeks,
it's about a millimeter.

27:32.752 --> 27:35.788
Alright, I'm in.

27:35.822 --> 27:36.989
You hit that
with a 22-gauge?

27:37.023 --> 27:38.791
Sick.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.860
Dr. Zelinsky, I need you to
check on the rule-out appy.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.962
Right now?
I don't want her
to perf. Go.

27:42.995 --> 27:46.766
Pull off one cc
for the lab.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.100
TRACI:
It's okay so far?

27:48.134 --> 27:50.136
It's perfect.
It couldn't be better.

27:50.169 --> 27:53.906
Must have been
one hell of a prayer.

27:53.940 --> 27:57.176
TAGGART:
Don't worry, Harold.
She's having a bad day.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.978
(Harold slams can lid)

27:59.011 --> 28:01.447
I'll be in Trauma
if you need me.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.883
Got it.
Gates, is that even
your patient?

28:03.916 --> 28:04.951
I'm taking care
of the boyfriend.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.152
He's very concerned.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.920
Yeah, well,
I'm very concerned, too.

28:07.954 --> 28:09.355
You've been working on this case
for about eight hours now.

28:09.388 --> 28:10.890
These two have a lot
of special needs--

28:10.923 --> 28:12.825
you know, medical,
social, psychological.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.493
You know, that's just great, but
you're not in the ICU anymore.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.895
Quick. Top three organisms
for neonatal sepsis.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.363
You need to be re-booted
back to ER mode.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.465
That means stabilize and pass
off to the admitting team.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.133
That might be appropriate
if it were simple pneumonia
or cellulitis...

28:21.167 --> 28:23.335
Dr. Pratt,
I need an answer.
Shut up, Morris.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.371
Let me just check
on this transfusion.
What did I just say?!

28:25.404 --> 28:26.806
Kayson wrote the orders,
I'm discharging Bevan.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.207
No, you're not.
Gates!

28:28.240 --> 28:29.842
I got to deal with this.
I'll talk to you later.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.210
Okay, you're feeling
some pressure-- excellent.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.813
Name three bacteria
for neonatal sepsis.

28:33.846 --> 28:35.114
Bend over and kiss my ass.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.849
Those are not bacteria.

28:36.883 --> 28:39.185
Group B strep,
E. coli, and listeria.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.788
Not bad, Abby.

28:41.788 --> 28:44.390
COBURN:
It's turbulent flow in the UV.
Excuse me.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.492
My intern's in with
your belly pain guy?

28:46.525 --> 28:50.396
Uh, okay, but, uh, Dr. Coburn,
I had a question for you.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.298
Another consult?

28:52.331 --> 28:54.901
No, not exactly.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.468
Could you find me
when you're done here?

28:58.204 --> 28:59.906
Let's go ahead with
the platelet infusion.

28:59.939 --> 29:02.274
TAGGART:
18cc's of packed cells
are in.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.010
So I hear Luka's in Europe.

29:04.043 --> 29:05.344
Something about his dad?

29:05.377 --> 29:06.345
Multiple myeloma.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.948
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.316
Well, things are
a little bit better.

29:10.349 --> 29:12.084
He should be home soon.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.420
Must be hard.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.455
You're managing
with Joe?

29:16.488 --> 29:18.190
Joe's amazing.

29:18.224 --> 29:19.458
You should see him.

29:19.491 --> 29:24.163
He's walking, babbling,
feeding himself.

29:24.196 --> 29:26.165
He loves the books
you got him for his birthday.

29:26.198 --> 29:30.002
Good Night Gorilla has to be
the last book every night.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.207
You drank?

29:35.241 --> 29:37.543
(sighs)

29:39.846 --> 29:41.948
When?

29:41.981 --> 29:43.850
Last night.

29:43.850 --> 29:46.585
You want to get
to a meeting?

29:46.618 --> 29:48.487
(laughing):
I don't have time
to go to a meeting.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.889
I don't need to go
to a meeting.

29:49.922 --> 29:52.925
I just...
I had a bad day,

29:52.959 --> 29:57.396
a very bad day,
and it was just one time.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.065
I'm not going
to start drinking again.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.234
Really?

30:05.371 --> 30:06.572
Are you an alcoholic?

30:06.605 --> 30:08.407
Yes, but...
Yes, but?

30:08.440 --> 30:10.309
All those years that you
were sitting in meetings,

30:10.342 --> 30:12.244
were you an
alcoholic then?

30:12.278 --> 30:13.946
Yes or no?

30:18.117 --> 30:20.052
Okay, keep drinking.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.253
Do the research,
see what happens.

30:21.287 --> 30:22.855
I can handle this.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.523
Just let me know how
it works out for you.

30:24.556 --> 30:26.859
Okay, I've got a clinic
full of patients.

30:26.893 --> 30:30.162
Janet, Janet, you're my sponsor.

30:30.196 --> 30:33.165
I was your sponsor,
but now it's very simple.

30:33.199 --> 30:34.901
If you've decided
you're not an alcoholic,

30:34.934 --> 30:36.936
I can't help you.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.071
If you are,
I'll be your sponsor again

30:39.105 --> 30:41.473
and I'll support you
in recovery.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.345
Let me know
what you decide.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.594
MORETTI:
Really, it's okay.

31:02.628 --> 31:05.264
You can call me anytime.

31:05.297 --> 31:06.598
Okay.

31:06.632 --> 31:09.468
Good luck on
your midterms.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.337
I love you, too.

31:11.370 --> 31:15.207
Bye.

31:15.241 --> 31:17.443
That was my son.

31:17.476 --> 31:20.279
In Rhode Island.

31:20.312 --> 31:23.515
He's having a hard time
in college.

31:23.549 --> 31:24.951
Really?

31:24.951 --> 31:30.089
Yeah, he's a long way from home.

31:30.122 --> 31:31.690
I don't know if it's
the normal school stress

31:31.723 --> 31:33.993
or if it's more...

31:38.130 --> 31:41.333
But... I feel like
he's not telling me stuff.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.669
(chuckling):
You know.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.304
It's hard to know
what's going on

31:45.337 --> 31:47.106
with someone
even if they're your own kid.

31:47.139 --> 31:48.707
Yeah.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.010
I'm sorry, but they're waiting
for me to sign out.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.378
Oh, good night, Abby.

32:02.154 --> 32:03.489
Migraine lady's
still groaning.

32:03.522 --> 32:04.690
Uh, four more of MS.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.125
You out of here?
I'm trying.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.459
Frank, did Ortho call back yet?

32:07.493 --> 32:09.061
FRANK:
Oh, damn it,
another dead end.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.997
MORRIS:
You said this
would be easy.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.098
PRATT:
And you're sure you
spelled his name right?

32:12.131 --> 32:13.565
FRANK:
Yeah...
Frank?

32:13.599 --> 32:15.301
...there's nothing.
There's no mortgage.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.036
There's no credit cards,
not even any student loans.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.437
Well, maybe he had
a full scholarship.

32:18.470 --> 32:19.638
Hello!

32:19.671 --> 32:20.306
Ortho?

32:20.339 --> 32:21.740
Not yet.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.110
I can't even find
a birth record for this guy.

32:24.143 --> 32:26.078
What are you guys doing?
PRATT:
Background check
on Neela's intern.

32:26.112 --> 32:27.413
Yeah, we're going
to figure out his age.

32:28.547 --> 32:31.617
Oh... I'm here late

32:31.650 --> 32:34.253
because our clerk
can't get CT results

32:34.286 --> 32:37.123
or call consults, and
my attendings don't have time

32:37.156 --> 32:38.557
to hear about a migraine,

32:38.590 --> 32:41.560
DKA, femur fracture, or an
incarcerated hernia because

32:41.593 --> 32:43.562
they're all too busy playing
"how old is the intern"?

32:43.595 --> 32:45.497
It was just a
couple of minutes.
What are you talking about?

32:45.531 --> 32:46.565
We've been here
the whole time.

32:46.598 --> 32:47.566
These are my pass-ons.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.201
Hey, Harold,
how old are you?

32:49.235 --> 32:50.102
25.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.270
That's an intern?

32:51.303 --> 32:54.040
How old were you
during the O.J. trial?

32:54.040 --> 32:58.144
Uh... well, that was,
uh, like 1995...

32:58.177 --> 32:59.178
You're not 25.

33:01.213 --> 33:02.448
You're right. I'm 19.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.183
RASGOTRA:
19?
No way.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.651
I started college
when I was 12,

33:05.684 --> 33:06.685
med school when I was 15.
I was home-schooled.

33:06.718 --> 33:08.620
How is that
possible?

33:08.654 --> 33:10.689
I got a perfect score on
the SATs when I was 11,

33:10.722 --> 33:12.758
so I knew I was ready
for college.

33:15.827 --> 33:20.066
Alright, let's go and check
on that rule-out appy.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.367
Dr. Gates.
GATES:
Mm.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.768
Can I talk to you for a minute?

33:22.801 --> 33:24.436
Yep.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.805
I understand that Dr. Kayson
wrote a discharge order

33:26.838 --> 33:28.574
for Bevan Guang.
Mm-hmm.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.176
And that you
cancelled it?

33:30.209 --> 33:31.643
Is this your idea of
creative problem-solving?

33:31.677 --> 33:33.179
I didn't know
what else to do.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.081
Well, did you consider
a holter monitor?

33:35.081 --> 33:36.248
What about
a transfer?

33:36.282 --> 33:38.250
Runs of V tach,
I need a doctor in here!

33:38.284 --> 33:40.519
Open the crash cart.
Call Kayson.

33:42.654 --> 33:45.324
Dr. Morris.
Dr. Morris.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.358
Your dad got
moved upstairs.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.293
We just wanted

33:47.326 --> 33:48.360
to say good-bye.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.229
You've been
very wonderful.

33:50.262 --> 33:54.200
Uh... just doing my job.

33:54.233 --> 33:56.102
It's too bad
things didn't work out.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.438
We could have
had some fun.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.773
Ciao.
See ya.

34:08.347 --> 34:09.815
Frank!

34:09.848 --> 34:11.617
How about the LFTs
on my hepatitis guy?

34:11.650 --> 34:12.583
Called five minutes ago.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.219
Well, call again.

34:14.253 --> 34:15.621
It's been three hours.
Abby's right.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.188
Why can't anything
get done around here?

34:17.223 --> 34:19.190
Tell me the Ottawa
Ankle Rules.

34:19.225 --> 34:20.359
Where's his chart?

34:20.391 --> 34:21.460
C'mon, Archie,
the ankle rules.

34:21.493 --> 34:22.728
There's only
five of them.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.429
I don't have time
for your stupid games.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.465
(laughs)

34:26.498 --> 34:28.367
GATES:
Going again.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.302
Clear.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.208
Normal sinus.

34:37.543 --> 34:38.777
Strong carotid.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.312
What happened?

34:40.346 --> 34:41.413
Pulseless
V tach.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.781
You're kidding.

34:42.813 --> 34:44.250
Well, take a look
at the strip.

34:44.283 --> 34:46.318
150 of amiodarone.

34:46.351 --> 34:47.786
Recurrent ventricular

34:47.819 --> 34:50.789
arrhythmias in the absence
of amphetamines.

34:50.822 --> 34:53.592
It's possible he'll need
an implantable defibrillator.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.393
MARQUEZ:
Glad I didn't
discharge him.

34:55.427 --> 34:56.795
He would have died
on the way home.
Yeah.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.530
Good thing we got busy
with another trauma.

34:58.564 --> 35:01.167
I'll go prep the EPS lab.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.169
You alright, Dr. Gates?

35:03.169 --> 35:04.236
Yeah.

35:06.305 --> 35:07.473
MORETTI:
Jack, hold on.

35:07.506 --> 35:08.807
(moans)

35:08.840 --> 35:09.875
Welcome back.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.543
You know,

35:11.577 --> 35:13.712
sometimes I wish I could just
see the patients by myself

35:13.745 --> 35:15.281
without the residents.
Huh.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.316
Life would be
so much easier.
I know.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.385
They don't listen.
They don't wanna learn.

35:19.418 --> 35:20.752
They think they
know everything.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.754
And you know
the worst part?
Hmm.

35:22.788 --> 35:26.492
Every now and then,
they turn out to be right.

35:38.404 --> 35:40.306
WOMAN:
Excuse me, Miss.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.542
Is that yours?

36:13.972 --> 36:15.541
MORRIS:
Oh,

36:15.574 --> 36:17.276
I miss you, too, baby.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.278
Is it hot down there?

36:19.311 --> 36:21.280
Really?

36:21.313 --> 36:22.748
So, uh...

36:22.781 --> 36:24.616
what are you, what are you
wearing right now,

36:24.650 --> 36:27.686
like a, like a tank top?

36:27.719 --> 36:30.289
All hot and sweaty
and clinging to your skin.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.690
(drapes open suddenly)

36:31.723 --> 36:32.958
I need this bed.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.426
Yes, uh, thank you.

36:34.460 --> 36:35.627
Uh, could you
please page Urology

36:35.661 --> 36:38.264
for Dr. Morris in the ER?
Thanks.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.266
Hope, you still there?

36:40.299 --> 36:41.967
So when you're...
when you're all hot and steamy,

36:42.000 --> 36:43.969
what, what do you to cool off?

36:44.002 --> 36:45.971
Oh, I'm so jealous.

36:46.004 --> 36:47.839
You're that close
to the Caribbean?

36:47.873 --> 36:50.276
Do they have
any topless beaches?

36:50.276 --> 36:52.278
Oh, you are such a bad girl.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.280
Wouldn't mind going
skinny-dipping with you

36:54.313 --> 36:56.282
late at night.

36:56.315 --> 36:57.616
Yeah? Yeah, then, then,

36:57.649 --> 36:59.585
then I'll take you back
to your tent...

36:59.618 --> 37:01.487
Right, hut.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.356
Oh, I'll, I'll sneak into
your hut one of these nights

37:04.390 --> 37:05.491
and, uh...

37:05.524 --> 37:06.592
Hold on. Hold on.

37:06.625 --> 37:07.793
Uh, Bardelli.

37:07.826 --> 37:08.960
Can I, can I use

37:08.994 --> 37:10.562
your rig for five minutes?

37:10.596 --> 37:12.030
I have an administrative tour.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.699
Take your time.
I'm gonna grab some dinner.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.401
Okay, okay.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.303
Okay, where were we?

37:17.303 --> 37:19.305
Right, right, right, you...
you're, you're, you're,

37:19.338 --> 37:22.574
you're fast asleep naked
under satin sheets.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.810
And first, first I gently nibble
on your toes,

37:24.843 --> 37:26.845
then your, then your ankles.

37:26.878 --> 37:29.348
Now I'm licking the back
of your knee.

37:29.381 --> 37:30.949
My baby's okay?

37:30.982 --> 37:32.718
Yeah, everything
looks great.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.320
No contractions.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.821
Hydrops should resolve
in a couple of weeks.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.423
Excellent.

37:37.456 --> 37:39.358
So did you hear about Bevan?

37:40.692 --> 37:42.661
Heard his heart was bad again.

37:42.694 --> 37:43.795
Yeah, but
this time,

37:43.829 --> 37:44.896
there were no
amphetamines

37:44.930 --> 37:46.632
in his system.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.634
So we think it's something
called Brugada syndrome.

37:48.667 --> 37:51.503
That means he was born with an
electrical problem in his heart.

37:51.537 --> 37:53.004
So it wasn't the drugs?

37:53.038 --> 37:54.640
No.

37:54.673 --> 37:56.675
And he'll need a shock
box in his chest.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.914
Okay, but he still took speed.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.550
Yeah, once, to get
through work.

38:04.583 --> 38:05.617
And he realized

38:05.651 --> 38:06.918
it was wrong
and he promised

38:06.952 --> 38:09.054
from now on, nothing
stronger than coffee.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.356
You think he means it?

38:14.025 --> 38:15.527
I guess I should go see him.

38:15.561 --> 38:16.562
If you're ready.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.435
Hey.
Hey.

38:23.469 --> 38:24.770
I'm gonna go talk to Bevan.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.004
Good.

38:26.037 --> 38:28.740
I think that's
a good thing.

38:28.774 --> 38:31.377
You know that guy
Robert Frost?

38:33.379 --> 38:34.913
He was right.

38:37.048 --> 38:39.585
Robert Frost?

38:39.618 --> 38:43.655
He said, "The only way out
is always through."

38:43.689 --> 38:44.723
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.

38:44.756 --> 38:45.957
Done a great job
with her.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.493
Oh, I just held
her hand.

38:47.526 --> 38:49.961
Told her it was okay
to be mad at God.

38:49.995 --> 38:50.796
Is that right?

38:50.829 --> 38:52.063
Yeah.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.533
I get mad at God
all the time.

38:54.566 --> 38:57.068
It's actually done wonders
for our relationship.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.905
And I haven't been struck
down by lightning.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.407
Yeah, not yet.

39:01.407 --> 39:03.409
Alright, so,

39:03.409 --> 39:04.776
how, how does
someone like you

39:04.810 --> 39:06.778
become a, a chaplain?

39:06.812 --> 39:08.714
I mean is there a lot
of training?

39:08.747 --> 39:10.916
No worse than
med school.
Mm-hmm.

39:10.949 --> 39:13.985
So, I guess, um,
so I guess,

39:14.019 --> 39:15.954
you'd have to give up
a lot of things, huh?

39:17.055 --> 39:18.657
Well, I don't know.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.759
Aren't there like, like,
like vows or something?

39:20.792 --> 39:22.027
Dr. Gates,
I'm not a nun

39:22.060 --> 39:23.662
and I'm not a saint.

39:23.695 --> 39:26.798
I'm a woman who happens
to be a chaplain.

39:26.832 --> 39:29.968
And you don't really
get that, do you?

39:30.001 --> 39:31.703
Yes, I do.

39:31.737 --> 39:32.638
Get what?

39:32.671 --> 39:34.005
(chuckles)

39:34.039 --> 39:36.742
That I have a
spiritual life,
Uh-huh.

39:36.775 --> 39:38.777
and a spiritual
career,

39:38.810 --> 39:41.780
but I live in the
real world.

39:41.813 --> 39:44.149
That sounds nice.

39:44.182 --> 39:46.084
You should try
it sometime.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.559
I don't know.

39:53.592 --> 39:56.495
Maybe it's not too late
to switch to something else.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.097
(sighs)

39:59.130 --> 40:02.033
Seriously, I don't think
I can take a year of this.

40:07.105 --> 40:09.708
(whispering):
Hey, listen, I gotta go.
Call you later.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.021
Do you want to start
evening rounds?

40:23.054 --> 40:25.123
No, trauma's coming in.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.158
You alright?

40:27.192 --> 40:28.694
Yeah.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.596
Are you...

40:30.629 --> 40:31.963
You're not...

40:31.997 --> 40:33.164
No.

40:33.198 --> 40:34.900
No, I'm fine.

40:34.933 --> 40:38.003
This is all because I've
been riding you so hard?

40:39.137 --> 40:40.839
(sighs)

40:40.872 --> 40:42.908
Bollocks. Come on.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.175
I'm not really
a mean person.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.677
It's just that
my boss told me

40:45.711 --> 40:46.978
that I had
to be that way

40:47.012 --> 40:48.614
so you'd work harder
and learn more.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.749
It's not working.
Yeah, I knew
this was stupid.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.484
But you were
so convincing.

40:52.518 --> 40:53.985
But I think you're
doing a fine job

40:54.019 --> 40:56.522
and from now on, I'm
gonna be a lot nicer,

40:56.555 --> 40:57.856
and a lot more
supportive, okay?

40:57.889 --> 40:59.525
Okay.
No more
unnecessary scut,

40:59.558 --> 41:01.527
no more pimping just for
the sake of humiliation,

41:01.560 --> 41:02.794
and no more
taking credit

41:02.828 --> 41:03.929
for all your
good ideas.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.263
Oh, crap.
Don't believe

41:05.296 --> 41:06.097
a word I'm about
to say.
What?

41:06.131 --> 41:07.065
Just play along.

41:07.098 --> 41:07.999
What's coming in, Neela?

41:08.033 --> 41:09.735
Stab wound
to the chest.

41:09.768 --> 41:11.803
And don't think you can
set foot in that trauma

41:11.837 --> 41:13.038
until you advance all the drains
on the service,

41:13.071 --> 41:14.039
write your evening
progress notes,

41:14.072 --> 41:15.541
and check
pre-op labs

41:15.574 --> 41:16.775
for tomorrow's OR cases.

41:16.808 --> 41:17.909
Am I clear,
Zelinsky?
Yes.

41:17.943 --> 41:19.645
Yes, what?
Yes, Dr. Rasgotra.

41:19.678 --> 41:20.946
Well, what are you waiting for?

41:28.019 --> 41:29.120
(exhales)

41:29.154 --> 41:30.856
Nice!

41:30.889 --> 41:32.791
That's what I'm
talking about.

42:09.227 --> 42:10.929
What do you got coming in?

42:10.962 --> 42:12.931
Stab wound under
the left nipple.

42:12.964 --> 42:14.600
I can stay
if you want.
No.

42:14.633 --> 42:16.602
It's alright.
We got it.

42:16.602 --> 42:18.604
Good work today.

42:19.671 --> 42:20.806
Nice to have you back.

42:28.914 --> 42:30.882
Beautiful night, isn't it?

42:30.916 --> 42:33.752
Everything okay, Dr. Morris?

42:33.785 --> 42:36.788
Oh, yeah. Everything's good.

42:36.822 --> 42:38.223
Real good.
