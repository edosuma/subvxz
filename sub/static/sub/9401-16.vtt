a dangerous path.

Victoria:
Your honor...

00:10.874 --> 00:12.007
She does have a job.

00:12.074 --> 00:14.275
She works for me.

00:14.343 --> 00:15.910
How did we get the funding
for the movie?

00:15.978 --> 00:17.611
My father and I
put up the money,

00:17.679 --> 00:19.279
Because I believe in you.

00:19.347 --> 00:20.547
The movie shoots
in a week,

00:20.615 --> 00:22.169
And we don't have
a costume designer,

00:22.236 --> 00:24.319
Which is why
I'm asking you now.

00:24.387 --> 00:25.524
We just broke up.

00:25.591 --> 00:27.160
I want to direct.

00:27.260 --> 00:29.025
You were at the top
of the list.

00:29.092 --> 00:30.583
Better get to work.

00:30.650 --> 00:33.425
I'm sorry I lied to you.
This is yours.

00:33.493 --> 00:36.531
Just maybe don't give it
to taylor. [ chuckles ]

You're not seriously looking
to me for sympathy, are you?

01:16.317 --> 01:18.066
I really liked him.

01:18.133 --> 01:20.217
Yeah.

01:20.284 --> 01:22.401
And nobody's
ever left me before,

01:22.476 --> 01:24.523
Especially not a guy
like david.

01:24.591 --> 01:26.672
And what's that supposed
to mean?

01:26.740 --> 01:29.861
It's not like he's a super big
catch or anything.

01:29.929 --> 01:34.123
Oh, look, 9 across --

Oh, come on.
This happens every morning.

01:42.448 --> 01:44.093
Maybe you should get up
a little bit earlier.

01:44.161 --> 01:45.733
And maybe you should make more
when you take the last of it.

01:45.806 --> 01:46.844
I didn't. Quinn did.

01:46.912 --> 01:48.084
No, I didn't.

01:48.152 --> 01:49.457
Who ate all my cereal?

01:49.525 --> 01:50.903
Quinn.
Taylor.

01:50.971 --> 01:53.986
Sorry, buddy, taylor likes
to take things that aren't hers.

01:54.054 --> 01:55.355
* I ain't got nothing on me *

01:55.423 --> 01:57.497
Sweetie, we have
plenty more cereal.

01:57.565 --> 01:58.536
So, hales.

Okay, come on, jamie.

Uh, okay, I guess.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.570
I'm struggling with the dialogue
in this scene.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.572
It --
it doesn't feel honest.

04:33.941 --> 04:34.841
What's the scene?

04:36.543 --> 04:39.178
Um...

04:39.278 --> 04:40.978
It's the one
where he leaves her.

04:41.046 --> 04:43.513
Oh.

04:43.580 --> 04:45.982
Well, I think
all girls understand

The moment
there's another girl.

04:48.318 --> 04:52.120
<i>So maybe it's about
what they don't say.</i>

04:52.188 --> 04:56.557
Actually, I was thinking
he doesn't say enough, you know?

04:56.625 --> 04:59.460
I mean, she's got to know
that he loved her,

04:59.527 --> 05:02.528
But if she doesn't,

05:02.596 --> 05:04.997
He needs to find the words
to convince her.

05:05.065 --> 05:07.032
And what are those words?

05:07.100 --> 05:08.800
I don't know yet.

But I'm gonna find them.

are better.

into her eyes,

19:41.747 --> 19:42.580
Thank you.

19:47.052 --> 19:50.720
* in your dreams,
she escapes *

19:50.787 --> 19:52.955
* to a place
she doesn't know *

19:53.023 --> 19:54.290
Jamie, you bug,

19:54.357 --> 19:56.991
You are exactly what I need
to brighten my day.

19:57.059 --> 19:58.359
What are you doing?

19:58.426 --> 20:00.293
Jamie: Capturing
behind-the-scenes footage.

20:00.361 --> 20:04.430
Oh, well,
make me look fabulous.

20:04.497 --> 20:06.030
Hi.

20:06.098 --> 20:08.466
How you doing?

20:08.533 --> 20:10.501
Well, you know, working
on the ex-boyfriend's movie

20:10.568 --> 20:14.170
In the ex-ex boyfriend's house
is kind of weird,

20:14.238 --> 20:16.538
But I'm managing.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.307
What's going on
with the ex-boyfriend part?

20:18.374 --> 20:20.175
We're trying to be friends.

20:20.243 --> 20:22.244
And he's okay with that?

20:22.311 --> 20:24.345
He's fine. I'm fine.

20:24.413 --> 20:26.681
Everything's
gonna be fine.

20:26.749 --> 20:28.249
All right,
well, let me know

20:28.317 --> 20:30.651
If you need me to knock
some sense into the guy.

20:30.718 --> 20:32.452
Thanks.

20:32.520 --> 20:36.288
* though sticks and stones
broke her bones *

20:36.356 --> 20:41.959
* they will not find a way
to break her soul *

20:42.027 --> 20:45.095
Woman: Kind of slow in here.
Oh, these are cute.

20:45.163 --> 20:47.031
Ah, there's this.
Can I help you find
anything?

20:47.098 --> 20:48.031
Oh, no,
we're just looking.

20:48.099 --> 20:49.466
Okay.

20:49.534 --> 20:52.869
Hey, uh, aren't you the model
for clothes over bros?

20:52.937 --> 20:56.138
Yeah. Well, I was
for that campaign.

20:56.206 --> 20:58.909
Why are you
folding clothes?

20:58.976 --> 21:04.547
Oh, um...I do a lot of things
for the company.

21:04.614 --> 21:07.649
* a little setback,
a little breakdown *

21:07.717 --> 21:09.718
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

21:09.785 --> 21:11.986
Okay.
Thanks.

21:12.054 --> 21:13.854
God, she looks
so plain.

21:13.922 --> 21:15.088
I know.

21:15.156 --> 21:17.390
Mm-hmm.

21:17.458 --> 21:20.292
I don't know.
I think shirt.

21:20.360 --> 21:26.064

her heartbeat ends *

21:26.132 --> 21:28.467
Hi. You got a sec?

21:28.568 --> 21:30.068
Yeah, of course.

21:30.136 --> 21:31.569
First of all,

21:31.637 --> 21:33.337
I, um --
I just want to thank you

21:33.405 --> 21:35.138
For everything
you've done for me.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.873
It means --

21:36.941 --> 21:39.342
Well, it means a lot.

21:39.409 --> 21:41.009
Don't worry about it.

21:41.077 --> 21:42.344
What's going on?

21:42.411 --> 21:43.578
You sold your car.

21:43.646 --> 21:45.479
How much money
did you put up?

21:45.547 --> 21:47.915
Alex --
julian, how much?

21:47.983 --> 21:49.816
All of it.

21:51.118 --> 21:53.086
Julian,
what if I let you down?

21:53.153 --> 21:54.420
Then what?

21:54.488 --> 21:55.921
You're not
gonna let me down.

21:55.989 --> 21:58.056
But you put everything you had
into this movie.

21:58.124 --> 21:59.057
Why did you do that?

21:59.125 --> 22:00.858
Man: Two minutes!

22:00.926 --> 22:03.794
Because you put everything
you had into this script.

22:03.861 --> 22:07.230
And it's good.
And you're good.

22:07.298 --> 22:09.798
Okay? You're not
gonna let me down.

22:09.866 --> 22:12.468
[ sighing ] okay.

22:16.072 --> 22:19.840
Oh, haley.
It is such a beautiful home.

22:19.907 --> 22:23.075
I am so proud
of you and nathan.

22:23.143 --> 22:24.576
Thanks.

22:24.644 --> 22:27.812
I feel really lucky
to have him and jamie.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.580
And it's great, you know,

22:29.648 --> 22:32.082
'cause all the stuff
doesn't matter so much.

22:32.150 --> 22:35.652
It's just -- although
I'm really grateful to
have all the extra space

22:35.719 --> 22:37.053
Now that quinn and taylor
are here.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.255
Well, it's an important role
being your sisters' keeper.

22:39.322 --> 22:40.589
They're lucky to have you.

22:40.657 --> 22:42.591
Well, I'm glad
that you're here

22:42.658 --> 22:44.993
Because I don't speak taylor
fluently,

22:45.060 --> 22:47.228
And I really need you
to translate.

22:47.296 --> 22:49.496
Taylor has
always been rebellious.

22:49.564 --> 22:53.133
That girl follows her heart
without thinking twice about it.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.301
Or once.

22:54.368 --> 22:56.569
[ laughter ]

22:56.637 --> 23:01.273
So...What's going on, mom?
What brings you to town?

23:01.341 --> 23:03.375
I'm just checking in
on my babies.

23:03.443 --> 23:06.344
I started with the oldest,
finished with the best.

23:06.412 --> 23:08.279
Mm. Nobody told me
you were coming.

23:08.347 --> 23:10.114
Well, that's because
I wouldn't let them.

23:10.182 --> 23:12.883
I'm a big fan
of surprises.
Oh.

23:12.951 --> 23:14.184
Now, come on.

23:14.252 --> 23:16.152
Fill me in on everything
that's been going on.

23:16.220 --> 23:17.920
And don't leave out
the good parts.

23:17.988 --> 23:19.188
Okay.

23:19.256 --> 23:21.890
Well, jamie's going
to a new school, and...

23:21.958 --> 23:23.592
So, let me
get this straight.

23:23.660 --> 23:26.627
You don't want to make a record
because it's too personal?

23:26.695 --> 23:28.662
That's right.
Personal sells albums.

23:28.730 --> 23:30.697
Personal wins grammys.

23:30.765 --> 23:32.265
People can --

23:32.333 --> 23:34.534
<i>Okay, well, most people
can relate to personal.</i>

23:34.602 --> 23:35.835
They want to hear the songs
with the words

23:35.903 --> 23:38.170
That they're
too afraid to say.

23:38.238 --> 23:43.575
So...When you're ready --

23:43.642 --> 23:46.043
Ahh -- man up...

23:46.110 --> 23:48.112
And make a record with me.

23:48.180 --> 23:54.216
* every night
I carry out my plan *

23:54.284 --> 23:59.588
* pray to god that one day
I could be your man *

23:59.655 --> 24:02.957
I can't believe this looks
exactly like uncle lucas' room.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.794
Hey, remember that time
he had a mohawk?

24:05.861 --> 24:06.828
Nathan: Yeah.

24:06.895 --> 24:08.764
That was cool.

24:08.831 --> 24:10.934
You miss him?

24:11.002 --> 24:12.602
Yeah.

24:12.669 --> 24:15.037
I miss lots of people,
I guess --

24:15.105 --> 24:18.340
Aunt peyton
and uncle skills and quentin.

24:18.407 --> 24:20.775
And grandpa dan --
I miss him a lot.

24:20.843 --> 24:23.177
Yeah, it's hard
when you miss people.

24:23.245 --> 24:25.645
But, you know, if you miss them,
it means you were lucky.

24:25.713 --> 24:27.881
It means you had
someone special in your life,

24:27.948 --> 24:29.615
Someone worth missing.

24:29.683 --> 24:31.484
Yeah, I guess.

24:31.551 --> 24:33.919
I just don't like
the missing part so much.

24:33.987 --> 24:36.888
Yeah, me neither.

24:36.956 --> 24:39.924
* there won't be much *

24:39.992 --> 24:42.159
Not fair. True.

24:42.260 --> 24:43.761
Oh, my gosh.

24:43.828 --> 24:46.630
Oh, my god.
You remember this?

24:46.697 --> 24:49.365
This is horrible.
Oh, mom, look at my hair.

24:49.433 --> 24:51.000
You gave me
the most awful haircut.

24:51.068 --> 24:53.035
It wasn't terrible.
It was cute, baby.

24:53.103 --> 24:54.703
Look at you,
with your little face

24:54.771 --> 24:56.171
And those
great big glasses.

24:56.239 --> 24:58.740
She was teased for that haircut,
like, every day.

24:58.808 --> 25:00.675
Yeah, I cried
for like a week,

25:00.743 --> 25:02.143
And then I wore a mop head
around the house

25:02.211 --> 25:03.278
To have princess hair.

25:03.345 --> 25:05.713
Haley was such a pudge.

25:05.781 --> 25:07.081
I was a baby.

25:07.149 --> 25:09.549
You're supposed to be fat
when you're -- give me that.

25:09.617 --> 25:11.551
Do you remember

25:11.619 --> 25:13.820
When you used to stuff your bra,
like, a lot?

25:13.887 --> 25:15.855
Mom, you have extras
of this?

25:15.922 --> 25:19.525
Uh, I think I have pictures
of just about all of it.

25:19.592 --> 25:22.560
Oh.

25:22.628 --> 25:25.363
[ sighs, laughs ]

25:25.430 --> 25:27.164
Are you okay, mom?

25:27.232 --> 25:29.299
Um...I'm sick.

25:29.367 --> 25:32.268

look at me.

25:32.336 --> 25:34.003
I swore I wasn't gonna cry,

25:34.071 --> 25:36.605
But, boy,
these tears are stubborn.

25:39.242 --> 25:41.777
Mom, but you're gonna be
okay, though, right?

25:43.646 --> 25:45.980
No. I'm not.

25:56.279 --> 25:58.489
***

25:58.867 --> 26:00.534
I have cancer.

26:00.602 --> 26:03.270
Oh, no, no, no.
It's pancreatic.

26:03.338 --> 26:07.971
And that means that even
with aggressive treatment,

26:08.039 --> 26:10.340
I wouldn't have
much time left.

26:10.408 --> 26:11.774
But there has
to be options, right?

26:11.842 --> 26:13.175
There aren't, quinny.

26:13.243 --> 26:14.709
Well, you have to try.

26:14.777 --> 26:17.412
Okay, now, I have made
my decision.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.414
And what I want to do is

26:19.481 --> 26:22.617
I want to live
the rest of my life fully,

26:22.685 --> 26:25.855
With my family,
not in some cold hospital.

26:25.923 --> 26:27.256
Mom, you need
to be doing

26:27.324 --> 26:29.091
Everything that you can
right now.

26:29.159 --> 26:31.893
Haley, I have come
to terms with this,

26:31.961 --> 26:34.228
And this is how
I want to do it.

26:37.799 --> 26:39.599
* that I won't be *

26:39.667 --> 26:41.533
You're giving up.

26:41.601 --> 26:44.569
No, I am not giving up.
I'm gonna die.

26:44.637 --> 26:45.604
Mom, don't say that!

26:45.671 --> 26:47.372
I can't change that, okay,

26:47.440 --> 26:49.475
So I've accepted it.

26:49.543 --> 26:51.777
How? How do you
just accept it, mom?

26:51.845 --> 26:53.145
You have to fight.

26:53.212 --> 26:56.681
Because I want to enjoy
the time I have left.

26:56.749 --> 26:59.550
Like you've been enjoying
every day since dad died?

26:59.617 --> 27:02.752
You're giving up,
and you know it.

27:02.820 --> 27:05.388
You're committing suicide.

27:05.456 --> 27:06.822

can take a picture of it,

27:06.890 --> 27:09.291

to this stupid box.
