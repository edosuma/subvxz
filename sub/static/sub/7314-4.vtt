Fresh out.

00:18.774 --> 00:20.791
Those things

00:20.793 --> 00:23.994
Must be those teenagers
I've been telling you about.

00:23.996 --> 00:26.714
Light fingers.

the light fingers around here.

I think they want
to meet up again.

01:28.728 --> 01:31.695
Uh, it was sort of a...
one-time thing for me, McGee.

01:31.697 --> 01:33.981
Oh, come on, admit it,
Tony. You had fun.

01:33.983 --> 01:36.867
Eh. It was a more social
experience than I expected.

01:36.869 --> 01:39.853
ZIVA: So, you two did end up
going out last night?

01:41.456 --> 01:43.457
How'd you know about that?

01:44.209 --> 01:46.377
I have hearing
like a horse.

01:46.379 --> 01:48.829
Hawk.
A horse's hearing, McGee,

01:48.831 --> 01:50.414
is one of their
keenest senses.

01:50.416 --> 01:52.633

Where did you two end up
going last night?

01:56.922 --> 01:58.806
Well, actually...
Went to a bar.

01:59.557 --> 02:01.425
ZIVA:
Well...

02:01.427 --> 02:02.876
I like bars.

Oh, wants  know if we're on

"We"? Okay, one second.

02:07.049 --> 02:09.883
Since when did you two start
picking up women together?

02:09.884 --> 02:11.352
You wouldn't understand
the science

02:11.354 --> 02:12.736
behind a good wingman, Ziva.

02:12.738 --> 02:15.272
All right, McGoose,
tell the girls

02:15.274 --> 02:17.324
Maverick says, "Game on."

02:17.326 --> 02:19.076
Maverick.

02:19.078 --> 02:21.245
<i>Top Gun.</i> McGoose.

02:21.247 --> 02:22.830
I can't believe
you two. (scoffs)

02:22.832 --> 02:25.449
Truth is stranger than fiction.
Grab your gear.

02:25.451 --> 02:28.902
Missing crew of <i>Ghostrunner 12</i>
just washed ashore.

02:28.904 --> 02:30.838
Didn't that helicopter go down
four days ago?

02:30.840 --> 02:32.739
Yeah. Come on, let's go.

02:35.927 --> 02:37.511
By the time
the ambulance got here,

02:37.513 --> 02:39.913
I had found the other two
on the beach, washed up.

02:39.915 --> 02:41.715
Only three survivors?

02:41.717 --> 02:43.417
The first one stumbled
into the store.

02:43.419 --> 02:45.185
He was the only
one conscious.

02:45.187 --> 02:47.087
The other two were...
passed out.

02:47.089 --> 02:48.439
Dry as a bone.

02:48.441 --> 02:49.423
No sweat.

02:49.425 --> 02:51.225
Sunstroke.
And bad.

02:51.227 --> 02:53.277
EMTs rushed them all
to the hospital.

02:53.279 --> 02:54.311
They say anything?

02:54.313 --> 02:55.279
Guy in the store just

02:55.281 --> 02:57.264
kept muttering about
someone named Happ.

02:57.266 --> 02:58.649
Yeah, well, that's the pilot.

02:58.651 --> 02:59.983
Fourth crew member.

02:59.985 --> 03:01.452
Guess he's still missing, then.

03:01.454 --> 03:04.371
I heard about the crash
last week on the news.

03:04.373 --> 03:05.873
Never put
two and two together

03:05.875 --> 03:07.791
till I talked
to your other agent.

03:09.244 --> 03:11.778
(chuckles)
Lots of letters like you.

03:11.780 --> 03:13.964
She got here
before you did.

03:19.137 --> 03:20.921
According to the report
last week,

03:20.923 --> 03:23.841
the helicopter crew was running
a routine training operation

03:23.843 --> 03:25.309
off the USS <i>Seahawk.</i>

03:25.311 --> 03:26.927
Didn't they send
a distress signal?

03:26.929 --> 03:28.929
They did, but Coast Guard
rescue operations

03:28.931 --> 03:29.963
didn't find anything.

03:29.965 --> 03:31.181
McGee?

03:31.183 --> 03:32.733
There is still liquid inside.

03:34.152 --> 03:37.071
Hard to believe there'd be
any fresh water left.

03:37.073 --> 03:38.021
Waterworld.

03:38.023 --> 03:39.523
Kevin Costner

03:39.525 --> 03:41.408
drinks his own urine. Smell it.

03:42.277 --> 03:43.810
(groans)

03:43.812 --> 03:45.079
Told you.

03:45.914 --> 03:47.114
Let me guess.

03:47.116 --> 03:49.583
Gross movie trivia works
with women in bars?

03:49.585 --> 03:52.152
Well, something must,
'cause Tim and I

03:52.154 --> 03:53.954
have a pretty fierce date
on Friday night,

03:53.956 --> 03:56.039
and I have to say
we are a force of nature.

03:56.041 --> 03:57.091
I see.
So women are just

03:57.093 --> 03:59.042
waiting for
this masculine force?

03:59.044 --> 04:00.094
Pretty much, yeah.

04:00.096 --> 04:02.513
Okay.

04:02.515 --> 04:04.181
(indistinct conversation)

04:05.016 --> 04:06.166
So, if it's that easy,

04:06.168 --> 04:08.051
I want you to pick up
the next woman you see.

04:09.270 --> 04:11.939
That's juvenile, and I'm more
mature than that now.

04:11.941 --> 04:15.008
Well, if either of you manages
to get a date,

04:15.010 --> 04:17.027
I will do both
of your case reports

04:17.029 --> 04:18.195
for the entire month.

04:18.197 --> 04:19.512
McGEE:
Why?

04:19.515 --> 04:22.232
What do you get out of it?
Game on.

04:22.234 --> 04:24.067
This a game to you, DiNozzo?

04:24.903 --> 04:25.953
Oh.

04:25.955 --> 04:27.821
Um, Agent Borin.

04:27.823 --> 04:30.190
Just sort of surprised
to see you here.

04:30.192 --> 04:31.625
(phone ringing)
Well, you shouldn't be,

04:31.627 --> 04:33.827
because I've been running point
on all search-and-rescue ops

04:33.829 --> 04:35.078
for the last four days.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.463
Borin.

04:36.465 --> 04:38.532
(grunts)
Read the briefings, DiNozzo.

04:38.534 --> 04:40.918
BORIN:
Got it. Thanks.

04:40.920 --> 04:44.037
That was one of my agents I sent
along for the ambulance ride.

04:44.039 --> 04:45.139
Did the crew say anything?

04:45.141 --> 04:46.890
Amidst the delirious
ramblings, yeah.

04:46.892 --> 04:48.142
Apparently, the helicopter

04:48.144 --> 04:50.043
was hit by a second aircraft.

04:50.045 --> 04:51.979
So we're looking for more
than a missing pilot.

04:51.981 --> 04:53.263
What happened up there?

04:53.265 --> 04:55.382
BORIN: That's what we have
to figure out.

05:06.170 --> 05:07.771
(mutters)

05:08.506 --> 05:09.690
<i>Tribune</i> or <i>Herald?</i>

05:09.692 --> 05:10.840
<i>Times.</i>

05:10.842 --> 05:12.776
Which one?
Does it matter?

05:12.778 --> 05:15.112
Eh.
They're all just calling about the helo.

05:15.114 --> 05:17.013
I'm surprised we haven't
heard from ZNN.

05:17.015 --> 05:19.032
Usually, they're the first ones to...
(phone rings)

05:22.019 --> 05:23.370
Oops.

05:24.372 --> 05:26.356
What? We got real work to do.

05:26.358 --> 05:27.908
Like finding
the mystery aircraft.

05:27.910 --> 05:28.909
I know.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.160
So let's stick with the crew

05:30.162 --> 05:31.411
we actually know
something about.

05:31.413 --> 05:32.546
I pulled service records

05:32.548 --> 05:34.298
on our missing helicopter pilot,

05:34.300 --> 05:36.250
Lieutenant Commander
Oliver Happ.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.635
And then we got files
on the three who washed up.

05:38.637 --> 05:39.869
The crew chief,

05:39.871 --> 05:41.338
Petty Officer Josie Sparks;

05:41.340 --> 05:43.140
copilot,
Lieutenant Hank Joplin;

05:43.142 --> 05:46.059
and rescue swimmer,
Petty Officer Adam Portis.

05:46.061 --> 05:47.344
Rescue swimmer.

05:47.346 --> 05:49.930
There's a job skill you hope
you never have to use.

05:49.932 --> 05:52.349
ZIVA: Speaking
of job skills...

05:54.218 --> 05:55.552
What's this?

05:55.554 --> 05:57.521
Rubbers for your date
with Borin.

05:58.389 --> 06:00.157
Oh, extra large.

06:00.159 --> 06:01.942
You knew my size.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.660
(scoffs)
McGEE: Thank you, Ziva,

06:03.662 --> 06:05.061
but I don't think
we need your help.

06:05.063 --> 06:06.697
Maybe not.
But Borin does.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.898
She wanted extra hands
with debris collection,

06:08.900 --> 06:11.084
and so I volunteered
the two of you.

06:11.869 --> 06:13.253
Unless, of course,
you would rather

06:13.255 --> 06:16.089
me say that the wingmen
had to pull out.

06:16.908 --> 06:18.208
Pilots pull up.

06:18.210 --> 06:20.260
I meant exactly what I said.

06:20.262 --> 06:22.546
(phone rings)

06:22.548 --> 06:25.515
Don't answer that.
Don't bother.

06:25.517 --> 06:26.750
Agent David.

06:26.752 --> 06:28.251
Yes.

06:29.971 --> 06:31.921
Thank you.

06:31.923 --> 06:33.557
That wasn't ZNN?

06:33.559 --> 06:34.941
That was the squadron C.O.

06:34.943 --> 06:36.360
He's here to
brief Gibbs.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.812
He didn't say anything about
being hung up on before, did he?

06:38.814 --> 06:40.814
Don't think that's
on his mind right now.

06:42.734 --> 06:44.434
JOPLIN: Tower, we're experiencing
radar altimeter failure.

06:44.436 --> 06:45.702
Happ, we're losing altitude.

06:45.704 --> 06:47.037
HAPP:
I lost the horizon.

06:47.039 --> 06:48.488
(alarm blaring)
I lost the horizon!

06:48.490 --> 06:49.873
JOPLIN:
Pull up, pull up!

06:49.875 --> 06:51.074
(static)

06:51.076 --> 06:53.276
Last transmission never
mentioned a second aircraft.

06:53.278 --> 06:55.128
FAA and local air traffic
controllers

06:55.130 --> 06:57.798
never reported anything
in the area of the crash.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.416
What area is that, Captain?

06:59.418 --> 07:01.668
This is my XO, Lieutenant
Commander Hernandez.

07:01.670 --> 07:04.421
He knows the mission
and its birds back to front.

07:04.423 --> 07:05.622
The last coordinates
indicate

07:05.624 --> 07:07.791
the helo went down off
the coast of Delaware, sir.

07:07.793 --> 07:09.609
GIBBS: Well, how'd they
end up in Maryland,

07:09.611 --> 07:11.261
Commander?
A RADALT failure

07:11.263 --> 07:14.314
could indicate
bigger nav system problems.

07:14.316 --> 07:16.183
These are likely false
crash coordinates.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.318
Would explain why we never
found signs of the wreck.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.103
And why you still haven't
found my pilot.

07:20.105 --> 07:21.521
We're updating
the search area now,

07:21.523 --> 07:23.190
but I'm not the one
that signed off

07:23.192 --> 07:24.825
on a faulty helicopter,
Commander.

07:24.827 --> 07:26.026
All right, now, listen.

07:26.028 --> 07:28.362
Nobody wants to
look bad here.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.814
This is an unavoidable
mechanical failure.

07:30.816 --> 07:32.982
We don't know what it is
until we ask the crew.

07:32.984 --> 07:34.701
Well, until the crew
is medically cleared,

07:34.703 --> 07:37.087
the only people allowed in
are immediate family.

07:37.089 --> 07:39.790
Right now, your focus should be
on finding that missing wreck

07:39.792 --> 07:41.124
and Lieutenant Commander Happ.

07:41.126 --> 07:42.843
It is.
Eyewitness testimony

07:42.845 --> 07:44.795
could give us
flight trajectory, landmarks,

07:44.797 --> 07:47.013
any number of factors that...
Doctor's orders.

07:47.015 --> 07:48.498
Pentagon prefers this crew to be

07:48.500 --> 07:50.300
completely recovered
and fully lucid.

07:50.302 --> 07:52.602
We don't want any more
delusional misinformation.

07:52.604 --> 07:54.888
It's already been four days
without any progress.

07:54.890 --> 07:56.723
The media is ready to cry foul.

07:56.725 --> 07:57.891
I'm not the media.

07:57.893 --> 08:00.026
I don't cry foul
unless there is one.

08:00.028 --> 08:01.611
The survivors could
at least tell us

08:01.613 --> 08:03.196
if the pilot survived the crash.

08:03.198 --> 08:04.531
Just find him.

08:04.533 --> 08:06.700
And call me when you do.

08:08.152 --> 08:09.286
You're not really

08:09.288 --> 08:12.188
gonna wait, are you?
No.

08:16.861 --> 08:19.045
(woman's voice over intercom)

08:25.753 --> 08:27.087
Jethro?

08:27.089 --> 08:28.388
Are you here?

08:28.390 --> 08:30.340
Yeah, right here, Duck.
Oh.

08:30.342 --> 08:32.308
(quietly):
I didn't see you hiding.

08:32.311 --> 08:34.010
I wasn't hiding.

08:34.011 --> 08:35.879
Why are you
whispering?

08:35.881 --> 08:37.347
Oh, I think it's appropriate,

08:37.349 --> 08:40.517
given the clandestine nature
of our mission.

08:40.519 --> 08:42.152
Duck.

08:42.154 --> 08:44.905
I asked you to get medical
records, not launch codes.

08:44.907 --> 08:45.939
Mm-hmm.

08:45.941 --> 08:47.657
Nice disguise.

08:47.659 --> 08:51.194
Yes, well, I'd like to think
that the success of this ruse

08:51.196 --> 08:54.948
is not because of a costume, but
because of my covert prowess.

08:54.950 --> 08:56.867
Thought you called in a favor.
Yeah, well,

08:56.869 --> 08:58.919
a cribbage friend
is head of oncology.

08:58.921 --> 09:00.737
It's on the floor above, but...

09:00.739 --> 09:02.038
that's beside the point.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.540
Well, let's get to the point.
Yes.

09:03.542 --> 09:06.009
I reviewed their records.

09:06.011 --> 09:08.962
Petty Officer Portis
remains comatose,

09:08.964 --> 09:11.798
but Lieutenant Joplin
and Petty Officer Sparks

09:11.800 --> 09:14.050
are recovering well.
That, in spite of the fact

09:14.052 --> 09:16.470
that they both suffered
acute dehydration

09:16.472 --> 09:17.604
and exposure.

09:17.606 --> 09:18.772
Injuries from the crash?

09:18.774 --> 09:20.524
No evidence
of head trauma

09:20.526 --> 09:22.559
or anything severe.
I mean, it's...

09:22.561 --> 09:24.227
it's a wonder, really.

09:25.780 --> 09:27.597
You believe there's more
to this crash

09:27.599 --> 09:29.199
than mere mechanical failure.

09:29.201 --> 09:30.934
No, I don't believe
anything yet.

09:30.936 --> 09:33.820
Yeah, well, if you're planning
to interview the survivors,

09:33.822 --> 09:35.288
you're gonna have to get past

09:35.290 --> 09:37.791
numerous guards
and medical staff.

09:37.793 --> 09:39.108
Yes.

09:39.110 --> 09:42.412
I will use my "covert prowess."

09:43.247 --> 09:44.915
I was going to suggest

09:44.917 --> 09:46.716
that you use a master key.

09:46.718 --> 09:49.970
It'll get you into
the security wing.

09:50.805 --> 09:52.672
This part of that favor?

09:52.674 --> 09:55.141
No.

09:56.794 --> 09:59.279
(quietly):
So I recommend you hurry.

10:05.152 --> 10:07.938
(panting)

10:08.806 --> 10:10.974
(grunts, sighs)

10:10.976 --> 10:12.409
(knocks)

10:12.411 --> 10:14.110
Lieutenant Joplin.

10:14.946 --> 10:16.746
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

10:16.748 --> 10:18.265
Afternoon, sir.

10:19.984 --> 10:21.952
You heading home?
No, sir.

10:21.954 --> 10:25.005
My C.O. thinks I should rest up
another day or two.

10:25.007 --> 10:27.791
Told the doctors
I was feeling okay, but...

10:27.793 --> 10:29.509
(grunts, sighs)

10:29.511 --> 10:31.344
Let me help.

10:31.346 --> 10:33.997
(grunts)

10:35.967 --> 10:37.517
If you don't mind
me asking, sir,

10:37.519 --> 10:39.436
shouldn't NCIS
be assisting

10:39.438 --> 10:41.187
with search and rescue?

10:41.189 --> 10:43.290
Well, we are.

10:44.692 --> 10:46.693
Anything you
can tell me

10:46.695 --> 10:49.145
to help find
Commander Happ?

10:50.180 --> 10:52.365
Not much chance he's
still alive, is there?

10:55.069 --> 10:57.571
How do I justify me
coming back instead of him?

10:57.573 --> 11:00.240
I don't have family, sir,
but Happ's got a wife and kid.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.342
Yeah, well, that's why I'm
asking you, Lieutenant.

11:03.694 --> 11:06.496
What happened?

11:08.332 --> 11:10.300
We were flying low.

11:10.302 --> 11:12.535
Tower, we're experiencing
radar altimeter failure.

11:12.537 --> 11:13.954
Happ, we're
losing altitude.

11:13.956 --> 11:15.255
Lost the horizon.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.273
Lost the horizon!

11:16.275 --> 11:18.008
Pull up, pull up!

11:18.876 --> 11:21.845
Everything after is a blur.

11:23.848 --> 11:27.350
Next thing I knew,
we were bottom up,

11:27.352 --> 11:29.002
scrambling for the raft.

11:29.854 --> 11:32.055
It was black
out there.

11:32.057 --> 11:33.389
Maybe we missed him.

11:33.391 --> 11:36.660
Maybe it's our fault he's gone.

11:47.038 --> 11:49.789
You mentioned a second craft
when you washed ashore.

11:49.791 --> 11:52.959
I did?

11:52.961 --> 11:54.094
Guess I must have been delirious

11:54.096 --> 11:56.429
'cause the only thing
we hit was water.

11:57.264 --> 11:59.633
250 RPMs
into the Atlantic.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.384
Might as well hit concrete.

12:01.386 --> 12:03.269
You got a better chance
of winning the lotto

12:03.271 --> 12:04.904
than walking away from that.

12:06.757 --> 12:09.225
I can't explain miracles, sir.

12:09.227 --> 12:10.910
Just give thanks for 'em.

12:13.698 --> 12:16.199
McGEE: Instead of looking
for washed up helicopter parts,

12:16.201 --> 12:17.867
we should have Abby looking
for evidence

12:17.869 --> 12:20.286
of who's turning this
ocean into a Dumpster.

12:20.288 --> 12:21.771
This place is
disgusting.

12:21.773 --> 12:24.908
Quit your eco-whining,
Captain Planet.

12:24.910 --> 12:25.942
(sighs)

12:25.944 --> 12:27.110
Want to win the bet or not?

12:27.112 --> 12:28.578
Well, not this badly.

12:28.580 --> 12:29.879
Still think
sucking up to Borin

12:29.881 --> 12:30.947
is the way to get a date?

12:30.949 --> 12:32.232
Really appreciate
the help, guys.

12:32.234 --> 12:33.166
Oh, hey, no problem.

12:33.168 --> 12:34.417
Oh, yeah, no,
this is great.

12:34.419 --> 12:35.885
Really like the new hair.

12:35.887 --> 12:37.003
Thanks.

12:37.005 --> 12:38.788
Uh, we're gonna hit
the north shore next.

12:38.790 --> 12:41.007
Marine debris can get caught
in the sewage plant intake.

12:41.976 --> 12:44.010
Ew, sewage.

12:44.012 --> 12:45.628
There's got to be
an easier way.

12:45.630 --> 12:47.897
Why don't you just walk up
to her and ask her out?

12:47.899 --> 12:48.965
Why not?

12:48.967 --> 12:50.517
I'm sure she'd enjoy
a free dinner,

12:50.519 --> 12:52.352
even if it is
from one of us.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.154
Get off my beach.

12:55.272 --> 12:57.107
Leave the bags and move along.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.492
Take it easy, pal.
We're federal agents.

12:59.494 --> 13:00.777
I'm not impressed.

13:00.779 --> 13:03.329
Coast Guard.
Drop the knife.

13:03.331 --> 13:06.449
All right,
all right,

13:06.451 --> 13:08.485
there's been
a misunderstanding.

13:08.487 --> 13:10.486
Yeah, you think?

13:10.488 --> 13:11.838
Who the hell
are you?

13:11.840 --> 13:13.540
Name's Shamus Quinn.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.791
I thought these blokes
were trying

13:14.793 --> 13:16.209
to muscle in
on my business.

13:16.211 --> 13:17.326
Garbage?

13:17.328 --> 13:19.713
Scrap-- metal
and recyclables--

13:19.715 --> 13:21.798
but it's hard to sell it
when you're stealing it.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.800
Well, I guess
it's a cutthroat business, huh?

13:23.802 --> 13:25.802
You gonna give
that back, champy?

13:25.804 --> 13:29.189
No, and this scrap is evidence

13:29.191 --> 13:31.558
in an ongoing investigation,
scruffy.

13:33.194 --> 13:35.178
Are we going to have a problem,
Mr. Quinn?

13:35.180 --> 13:37.513
Of course not, ma'am.

13:37.515 --> 13:39.699
Anything
for the Coast Guard.

13:39.701 --> 13:42.168
Women of the water
are a weakness of mine.

13:44.021 --> 13:46.856
But you are taking
my livelihood and my knife.

13:46.858 --> 13:48.541
Feel like
I should be getting

13:48.543 --> 13:50.193
something
out of this raw deal.

13:50.195 --> 13:51.628
Yeah, like what?

13:51.630 --> 13:53.880
I don't know,
maybe dinner with you.

13:56.033 --> 13:57.217
(laughs)

13:59.420 --> 14:00.837
Okay,

14:00.839 --> 14:02.338
but from now on,
anything you find

14:02.340 --> 14:04.557
on that beach gets turned over

14:04.559 --> 14:06.426
to the Coast Guard
immediately.

14:06.428 --> 14:07.710
But I get it back
when you're done.

14:07.712 --> 14:08.762
Deal.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.146
Sweet.

14:10.148 --> 14:11.547
(clicks tongue)

14:14.435 --> 14:17.821
Guess Agent Borin
likes her pork salted.

14:17.823 --> 14:19.555
Well, we can't compete
with that.

14:19.557 --> 14:22.158
Speak for yourself,
McInsecurity.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.227
What's that guy have
that I don't have?

14:24.229 --> 14:25.912
Calluses?

14:25.914 --> 14:28.114
I have emotional calluses.

14:28.116 --> 14:30.366
You want a date
with Agent Borin?

14:30.368 --> 14:34.871
No, I mean, I just don't
want to let Robert Shaw win.

14:36.006 --> 14:38.541
Besides, she's a little
too much like Gibbs.

14:38.543 --> 14:40.210
Well, that could be
a good thing.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.746
Gibbs is independent, loyal,
sometimes even caring.

14:43.748 --> 14:46.299
Have you told the boss
about these feelings?

14:46.301 --> 14:48.902
He can be open-minded.
(chuckles)

14:52.423 --> 14:54.440
Tony.

14:54.442 --> 14:56.276
What?

14:56.278 --> 14:58.444
Agent Borin!

15:01.031 --> 15:03.099
It's our missing pilot.

15:04.451 --> 15:06.369
TONY:
Well, if that's a gunshot wound,

15:06.371 --> 15:09.989
then he didn't
die in the crash.

15:17.893 --> 15:20.145
I still smell like warm sushi.

15:20.148 --> 15:23.648
Your little wingman setup
is proving to be painful.

15:23.650 --> 15:24.799
Well, that was the point.

15:24.801 --> 15:25.733
Yes.

15:25.735 --> 15:27.468
No, of course.
Thank you.

15:27.470 --> 15:30.155
You know, technically, maybe
I should be asking you out.

15:30.157 --> 15:32.139
You did say
the first woman I see.

15:32.141 --> 15:33.241
(chuckles)

15:33.243 --> 15:35.760
Cute, but you had your chance.

15:37.646 --> 15:39.948
Uh-huh. Thank you.

15:39.950 --> 15:42.617
Joplin and Sparks have been
released from the hospital.

15:42.619 --> 15:43.985
Good. I got questions.

15:43.987 --> 15:46.153
Yeah, I think the Pentagon
was anticipating that.

15:46.155 --> 15:47.839
They've assigned
JAG representation.

15:47.841 --> 15:49.257
TONY:
Which is a smart move

15:49.259 --> 15:52.177
considering the missing pilot's
got a bullet in his brain.

15:52.179 --> 15:53.428
You got info on the victim?

15:53.430 --> 15:54.629
ZIVA:
Uh-huh.

15:57.833 --> 16:00.001
Lieutenant Commander
Oliver Happ.

16:00.003 --> 16:03.021
Four years with Helicopter
Sea Combat Squadron 24.

16:03.023 --> 16:04.606
TONY: Otherwise known as
the Ghostrunners.

16:04.608 --> 16:06.007
Exemplary service record,

16:06.009 --> 16:09.227
including two commendations for
acts of bravery in Afghanistan.

16:09.229 --> 16:10.845
TONY:
He's married

16:10.847 --> 16:13.448
with a six-year-old son
who was recently diagnosed

16:13.450 --> 16:15.783
with neurofibro-fib...

16:15.785 --> 16:18.903
Neurofibromatosis
type two,

16:18.905 --> 16:21.339
but you can call it
NF2 for short.

16:22.708 --> 16:24.242
Hey.

16:24.244 --> 16:25.877
Can you give us
a minute, buddy?

16:25.879 --> 16:28.129
You can go play your game
over there by the window.

16:30.916 --> 16:32.199
That's a cool costume.

16:32.201 --> 16:33.251
<i>Top Gun?</i>

16:33.253 --> 16:35.470
No, no, he's a helicopter pilot

16:35.472 --> 16:36.804
like his father.

16:41.710 --> 16:44.429
I was told you found
my husband.

16:44.431 --> 16:45.713
Sorry for your
loss, ma'am.

16:45.715 --> 16:48.549
Thank you.

16:48.551 --> 16:49.884
What happened?

16:49.886 --> 16:52.887
I saw on the news that pilot
error hasn't been ruled out.

16:52.889 --> 16:54.973
We haven't ruled
anything out yet.

16:57.559 --> 17:00.895
Did you recover
his flight helmet?

17:00.897 --> 17:02.330
No, ma'am.

17:02.332 --> 17:03.915
No, we haven't.
Not yet. Why?

17:03.917 --> 17:06.584
Oliver-- my... my husband--

17:06.586 --> 17:10.404
he promised Gunner that
he could use it for Halloween.

17:11.790 --> 17:14.559
He... he worships
his dad.

17:18.263 --> 17:20.915
Like the rest of your crew,
Commander,

17:20.916 --> 17:24.602
you are strangely free
of impact trauma,

17:24.604 --> 17:27.137
and it appears you miraculously

17:27.140 --> 17:29.090
survived the crash.

17:29.092 --> 17:30.608
Not as lucky
with the bullet.

17:30.610 --> 17:32.977
Ah, well, it entered
the frontal lobe,

17:32.979 --> 17:34.195
made a mess of things

17:34.197 --> 17:35.429
and ended up on
the occipital.

17:35.431 --> 17:37.899
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

17:37.901 --> 17:38.950
No exit.

17:38.952 --> 17:40.068
Small caliber.

17:40.070 --> 17:41.402
Yeah, I just
sent the slug

17:41.404 --> 17:42.787
up to Abby
for processing.

17:42.789 --> 17:44.322
Time of death?

17:44.324 --> 17:46.207
No, impossible to say.

17:46.209 --> 17:47.875
Estimate.

17:47.877 --> 17:50.962
Uh, this man's
voice was heard

17:50.964 --> 17:53.247
on the aircraft's
last transmission?

17:53.249 --> 17:54.582
As it went down around midnight.

17:54.584 --> 17:56.884
Then I would estimate
that he was killed

17:56.886 --> 17:59.003
sometime after midnight.

17:59.005 --> 18:00.755
Shot at close range?

18:00.757 --> 18:03.508
Are you asking me if this
man committed suicide?

18:03.510 --> 18:04.792
Yes, I am.

18:05.894 --> 18:08.346
Then my answers are going
to continue to frustrate.

18:08.348 --> 18:10.315
He was immersed in water,

18:10.317 --> 18:12.600
so you can't
test for GSR.

18:12.602 --> 18:14.268
His face is eaten
by marine life,

18:14.270 --> 18:16.971
so you... you can't
discern stippling.

18:16.973 --> 18:20.024
While he may have
self-destructed,

18:20.026 --> 18:22.694
there is absolutely no
way for me to prove it.

18:22.696 --> 18:25.496
Hell of a way to go.

18:25.498 --> 18:27.832
Yes.

18:27.834 --> 18:31.485
But a slow death
adrift at sea,

18:31.487 --> 18:34.005
well, suicide may have become,

18:34.007 --> 18:36.490
well, a prudent
choice.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.330
Abby.

18:43.332 --> 18:45.466
Other Abby, welcome back.

18:45.468 --> 18:47.935
You looking for helicopter
parts or having a garage sale?

18:47.937 --> 18:49.520
Um, both.

18:49.522 --> 18:51.505
I put together
half a ten-speed bike,

18:51.507 --> 18:54.475
part of a car engine,
two kitchen blenders,

18:54.477 --> 18:56.110
all in perfect working order.

18:56.112 --> 18:58.613
I can't believe the things
that people throw away.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.898
Can't believe you took the
time to put it back together.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.484
If there were
any helicopter parts,

19:03.486 --> 19:06.204
I would have happily
built you a helicopter.

19:06.206 --> 19:08.706
Right now, I would just
settle for some good news.

19:08.708 --> 19:10.208
How about a lead
on our shooter?

19:10.210 --> 19:11.409
Ooh.

19:11.411 --> 19:12.493
I ran ballistics

19:12.495 --> 19:14.879
on the bullet
recovered from our victim.

19:14.881 --> 19:16.714
Was this before or after
your blender building?

19:16.716 --> 19:18.532
(chuckles)
Concurrent with.

19:18.534 --> 19:22.253
The bullet removed from
the skull is a .22-caliber.

19:22.255 --> 19:23.638
That's not Navy issue.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.140
The only handguns
on that helicopter

19:26.142 --> 19:27.925
should be
standard nine-millimeter.

19:27.927 --> 19:29.310
Any of the crew
own a spare?

19:29.312 --> 19:31.396
I found one six-inch,

19:31.398 --> 19:34.549
ten-round Beretta
registered

19:34.551 --> 19:36.401
to Petty Officer
Josie Sparks.

19:36.403 --> 19:38.236
(over phone):
Gibbs.

19:38.238 --> 19:39.821
Gibbs, it's Borin.

19:39.823 --> 19:41.406
(hangs phone up)

19:41.408 --> 19:44.108
ZIVA: Abby says Borin
is on her way up.

19:44.110 --> 19:46.077
I don't understand
what the big deal is, Ziva.

19:46.079 --> 19:47.078
It's just a date.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.229
TONY:
You tell her, McGee.

19:48.231 --> 19:50.248
Also, you owe me 40 bucks
for those tickets.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.166
They were your idea.

19:52.168 --> 19:54.452
And you're welcome.

19:54.454 --> 19:55.903
Now, get in there,
Hollywood.

19:55.905 --> 19:57.755
Take her breath away.

19:57.757 --> 19:58.923
Iceman's got your back.

19:58.925 --> 20:01.292
Why do you get to be Tom Cruise
<i>and</i> Val Kilmer?

20:01.294 --> 20:02.760
(elevator bell dings)

20:04.263 --> 20:06.747
Well, this is going
to be priceless.

20:08.467 --> 20:10.685
Hi, Agent Borin.

20:10.687 --> 20:14.255
Uh, I wanted to know, do
you like '80s cover bands?

20:14.257 --> 20:16.691
Because I have tickets.

20:16.693 --> 20:19.610
I mean, uh,
Tony got tickets

20:19.612 --> 20:24.148
for us, I mean, uh, you
know, if you want to go.

20:24.150 --> 20:27.101
Um, I just figured

20:27.103 --> 20:29.871
that since we were both born
around... you know, that...

20:29.873 --> 20:31.289
that you would
remember the '80s.

20:31.291 --> 20:33.241
How old are you?

20:34.442 --> 20:35.743
You asking me out, McGee?

20:35.745 --> 20:38.830
Well, yeah, well,
I've got tickets.

20:38.832 --> 20:39.881
Yeah, no,
got that part.

20:39.883 --> 20:42.917
GIBBS:
When's the concert, McGee?

20:42.919 --> 20:44.469
Uh, next week, boss.

20:44.471 --> 20:45.636
This can wait.

20:45.638 --> 20:47.338
Get Petty Officer Sparks
in here now.

20:47.340 --> 20:49.507
On it!
On it!

20:49.509 --> 20:52.626
I thought you had my back.
Nothing I could do. Had to eject.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.346
(speaking quietly)

20:55.348 --> 20:57.265
Special Agent Gibbs,

20:57.267 --> 21:00.268
this is Lieutenant
Nora Patel, JAG Corps.

21:00.270 --> 21:01.602
Lieutenant.

21:01.604 --> 21:03.454
I'm not finished.

21:04.857 --> 21:06.774
The Pentagon wanted me
to remind both of you

21:06.776 --> 21:08.359
that we are all
on the same team.

21:08.361 --> 21:09.694
We all want
the truth.

21:09.696 --> 21:11.996
Of course, sir.

21:18.504 --> 21:21.172
All on the same team, Leon?

21:21.174 --> 21:22.323
Could've fooled me.

21:22.325 --> 21:23.758
That's the
company line

21:23.760 --> 21:25.793
until the higher-ups
get one of two things:

21:25.795 --> 21:27.161
the truth or someone to blame.

21:27.163 --> 21:29.764
Well, I do prefer
that the two were related.

21:29.766 --> 21:31.549
Yeah, but I'm not sure they do.

21:35.003 --> 21:36.854
That's a nice tie, Leon.
A new look?

21:36.856 --> 21:38.172
It's my wife's idea.

21:38.174 --> 21:39.724
It's supposed to help
lighten my mood.

21:39.726 --> 21:41.275
Yeah?

21:41.277 --> 21:43.060
How's that working out?

21:43.062 --> 21:45.279
(door closes)

21:46.565 --> 21:49.183
My client doesn't know
anything about that.

21:49.185 --> 21:51.685
You understand how it looks
when you hide behind a lawyer?

21:51.687 --> 21:54.322
Lieutenant Sparks has
a right to legal counsel.

21:54.324 --> 21:56.207
If for no other
reason than to defend

21:56.209 --> 21:58.292
against any
unfair tactics.

21:58.294 --> 22:00.494
I've heard about you,
Agent Gibbs.

22:04.082 --> 22:06.651
Bullet that killed your pilot
was fired from a .22.

22:09.888 --> 22:10.922
You own one.

22:10.924 --> 22:12.723
Unauthorized
personal weapons

22:12.725 --> 22:14.208
are not permitted
on Navy operations.

22:14.210 --> 22:18.996
Which is why your client was
disciplined for it last month.

22:23.185 --> 22:26.537
You took your .22 on the flight
and you used it to shoot Happ.

22:28.273 --> 22:30.557
Now, does anything
sound unfair so far?

22:30.559 --> 22:32.076
We're leaving.

22:32.078 --> 22:34.111
Life's unfair, sir.

22:34.113 --> 22:37.081
Tell that to him.

22:37.083 --> 22:39.066
Happ knew
better than anyone.

22:39.068 --> 22:41.669
That's the problem.

22:41.671 --> 22:43.120
Don't say another word.

22:43.122 --> 22:45.122
No, because I didn't shoot him.

22:45.124 --> 22:47.391
Happ was the one
trying to kill us.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.762
I'm listening.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.255
Happ just found out
his kid's sick.

23:01.257 --> 23:03.608
No cure.

23:03.610 --> 23:05.776
Understandably,
he's been upset.

23:05.778 --> 23:07.428
He even got into a fistfight

23:07.430 --> 23:10.264
with the squadron commander
last week.

23:10.266 --> 23:12.316
But...

23:14.269 --> 23:17.004
But I didn't realize
how bad things were

23:17.006 --> 23:19.407
until I caught him drinking
before a mission briefing.

23:19.409 --> 23:22.243
She didn't report it because
Happ didn't fly that day.

23:22.245 --> 23:25.129
I let him sleep it off.

23:25.131 --> 23:27.131
Are you saying
your pilot was drunk?

23:27.133 --> 23:28.733
No, sir.

23:28.735 --> 23:30.668
We never would've let
him fly that night

23:30.670 --> 23:31.836
if something was wrong.

23:31.838 --> 23:34.839
He seemed fine.

23:36.642 --> 23:39.794
Until we caught him
messing with the RADALT system.

23:39.796 --> 23:42.113
<i>He said he couldn't go back.</i>

23:42.115 --> 23:44.849
<i>Couldn't face not knowing</i>
<i>if his kid was gonna die.</i>

23:44.851 --> 23:47.335
He put us into a dive.

23:47.337 --> 23:49.103
<i>We tried to stop him.</i>

23:49.105 --> 23:50.871
Pull up! Pull up!

23:50.873 --> 23:53.858
<i>I pulled my weapon, but never</i>
<i>got the chance to fire</i>

23:53.860 --> 23:55.276
<i>because we hit the water.</i>

23:55.278 --> 23:58.696
I lost it
and never saw Happ again.

23:58.698 --> 24:01.449
Why did you lie?

24:01.451 --> 24:03.668
I was trying to protect him.

24:03.670 --> 24:04.952
We all were.

24:04.954 --> 24:07.588
You can understand that,
Agent Gibbs.

24:07.590 --> 24:10.007
Protecting someone who tried
to kill three people?

24:10.009 --> 24:11.042
No.

24:11.044 --> 24:12.543
For his family.

24:13.762 --> 24:16.514
It's enough they lost
a husband and a father,

24:16.516 --> 24:19.183
but I guess now you're gonna
have to tell them the truth.

24:23.605 --> 24:25.823
He was a coward.

24:36.631 --> 24:38.632
Did you find out what happened,

24:38.634 --> 24:40.800
who shot my husband?

24:43.087 --> 24:45.755
How had your husband
been feeling lately?

24:46.623 --> 24:48.591
Oliver was fine.

24:48.593 --> 24:52.295
He looked forward to flying
any chance he got.

24:52.297 --> 24:53.730
Wh-What, what is this about?

24:53.732 --> 24:56.266
His reaction to
Gunner's diagnosis.

24:56.268 --> 24:58.435
He was devastated.

24:58.437 --> 25:01.438
We all were,
but that was weeks ago.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.439
Why are you asking?

25:02.441 --> 25:04.607
What's wrong?

25:06.577 --> 25:08.745
Found, uh...

25:09.914 --> 25:12.582
...a number of these
hidden around the house.

25:13.868 --> 25:15.919
Credit card shows
frequent trips

25:15.921 --> 25:18.621
to liquor stores
and bars.

25:22.259 --> 25:24.911
Has your husband been
drinking more lately?

25:24.913 --> 25:27.681
He drinks when he's
with friends

25:27.683 --> 25:29.549
and-and when he works
out in the garage,

25:29.551 --> 25:32.168
but it was never to excess,
and he would never fly drunk.

25:32.170 --> 25:34.554
No, not drunk--
depressed.

25:34.556 --> 25:37.340
His crew says he tried
to commit suicide.

25:37.342 --> 25:38.942
(sighs)

25:38.944 --> 25:42.128
No, no, suicide
is impossible.

25:42.130 --> 25:43.380
Why is that?

25:43.382 --> 25:45.681
Gunner.

25:50.054 --> 25:53.940
NF2 is a genetic disorder,
Agent Gibbs.

25:53.942 --> 25:56.859
It causes tumors to grow
randomly throughout the body,

25:56.861 --> 25:59.062
and right now,

25:59.064 --> 26:02.949
our son has a tumor wrapped
around his facial nerve,

26:02.951 --> 26:05.752
and when they remove
the tumor,

26:05.754 --> 26:08.338
the nerve will
most likely be destroyed.

26:08.340 --> 26:11.040
Oliver and I had to tell
a six-year-old boy

26:11.042 --> 26:14.060
that he will probably
never smile again.

26:14.895 --> 26:16.930
But Gunner didn't ask
any questions,

26:16.932 --> 26:18.598
he didn't cry.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.467
No, he's a tough kid.

26:20.469 --> 26:22.685
You know what
his main concern was?

26:24.221 --> 26:27.223
That he'd ruin
our family pictures.

26:32.997 --> 26:36.166
No one gives up
on a kid like that.

26:37.034 --> 26:39.202
Especially not his father.

26:42.456 --> 26:44.574
Are you saying
his crew is lying?

26:44.576 --> 26:46.993
Yes, I am.

26:49.063 --> 26:51.431
I don't care about
jurisdiction.

26:51.433 --> 26:53.466
I care about
finding that wreck,

26:53.468 --> 26:57.470
so just send the water
samples to NCIS for testing.

26:57.472 --> 26:58.555
MAN:
On it, boss.

26:58.557 --> 27:00.140
What exactly are
we testing for?

27:00.142 --> 27:01.558
Oil and other
mechanical fluids

27:01.560 --> 27:02.942
can linger
after a crash.

27:02.944 --> 27:04.227
If we can find a trace,

27:04.229 --> 27:05.428
then we'll get an idea

27:05.430 --> 27:06.996
of where to take
a closer look.

27:06.998 --> 27:09.566
I see. It's a long shot.

27:09.568 --> 27:12.202
Last hope.

27:12.204 --> 27:14.204
Just do it, Omagi.

27:14.206 --> 27:15.121
Out.

27:15.123 --> 27:16.456
Copy that.
Out.

27:16.458 --> 27:17.624
I forget you're
a team leader.

27:17.626 --> 27:20.776
(sighs) Yeah, a lot of
good I'm doing.

27:20.778 --> 27:22.278
Performance review?

27:22.280 --> 27:24.964
Abby told me.

27:24.966 --> 27:27.450
So, what are you
looking to do--

27:27.452 --> 27:29.719
move on up
or move on out completely?

27:29.721 --> 27:31.954
Maybe, uh, transfer
somewhere tropical?

27:31.956 --> 27:33.456
You trying to get
rid of me, DiNozzo?

27:33.458 --> 27:36.926
Oh, no, I just...
have been there.

27:36.928 --> 27:41.848
Looking for a better
job title, better money.

27:41.850 --> 27:44.184
So, what are you doing
still working for Gibbs?

27:44.186 --> 27:47.187
Can't offer me
better people.

27:51.609 --> 27:53.643
Listen, if you're not busy
this weekend,

27:53.645 --> 27:54.777
I actually was thinking...

27:54.779 --> 27:56.412
Oh, crap.

27:59.934 --> 28:02.151
Oh, Crawfish Casanova, huh?

28:02.153 --> 28:04.587
Yeah, relax. I'm not
going on a date with him.

28:04.589 --> 28:07.323
I only said I was

28:07.325 --> 28:09.792
because I knew what you
and McGee were up to.

28:09.794 --> 28:11.344
Ziva told me everything.

28:11.346 --> 28:13.596
Of course she did.

28:13.598 --> 28:15.164
So that means the bet's off.

28:15.166 --> 28:19.835
Yeah, and it sounds to me like
you have better people to ask.

28:19.837 --> 28:22.639
(truck door opens)

28:24.174 --> 28:26.175
Wait. Where's my stuff?

28:26.177 --> 28:27.510
(engine starts)

28:32.032 --> 28:34.183
CAPTAIN: <i>We've grounded</i>
<i>all rotary wing squadrons</i>

28:34.185 --> 28:35.368
until each and every bird

28:35.370 --> 28:37.487
is mechanically inspected
for flaws.

28:37.489 --> 28:40.022
So far, it appears to be
an isolated incident.

28:40.024 --> 28:41.875
And if the crash
was human error?

28:41.877 --> 28:44.544
I told you,
Happ wasn't depressed.

28:44.546 --> 28:46.713
Your crew is trained

28:46.715 --> 28:48.998
to compartmentalize
emotions, correct?

28:49.000 --> 28:50.717
They've also been trained
to recognize and speak up

28:50.719 --> 28:53.453
about operational
risk management factors--

28:53.455 --> 28:56.456
lack of sleep,
domestic problems.

28:56.458 --> 28:58.208
Suicidal tendencies.

28:58.210 --> 29:00.093
I know my people.

29:00.095 --> 29:02.211
A lot of people
under your command, Captain.

29:02.213 --> 29:06.182
Happ's been a friend
longer than a subordinate.

29:06.184 --> 29:07.734
I'm the first guy
he told

29:07.736 --> 29:09.068
when they were pregnant
with Gunner.

29:09.070 --> 29:11.671
I'm the first guy
he came to for support

29:11.673 --> 29:12.855
when he was diagnosed.

29:12.857 --> 29:15.358
Now, if there was something
wrong, I would know.

29:15.360 --> 29:17.760
ZIVA: So you knew
about the fight

29:17.762 --> 29:20.563
Happ started with
Lieutenant Commander Hernandez?

29:20.565 --> 29:22.332
What fight?

29:22.334 --> 29:23.449
Hernandez.

29:23.451 --> 29:24.500
Sir.

29:24.502 --> 29:26.119
Get your butt
over here.

29:28.122 --> 29:29.905
What are they
talking about?

29:29.907 --> 29:31.591
Petty Officer Sparks
mentioned it.

29:31.593 --> 29:33.793
Pilots get
competitive, ma'am.

29:33.795 --> 29:35.261
My training times
were better,

29:35.263 --> 29:37.263
and he accused
me of cheating.

29:37.265 --> 29:40.016
Nothing bruised but egos,
so I let it slide.

29:40.018 --> 29:41.467
Lot of that going around lately.

29:41.469 --> 29:43.303
CAPTAIN: I trust my crew,
Agent Gibbs.

29:43.305 --> 29:44.754
If they never said
anything to me,

29:44.756 --> 29:46.689
there was nothing
to worry about.

29:46.691 --> 29:48.691
Two of them are saying
something now, Captain.

29:48.693 --> 29:50.260
GIBBS:
That you let a man

29:50.262 --> 29:51.945
with emotional issues
fly that night.

29:51.947 --> 29:54.430
So who's lying,
Captain,

29:54.432 --> 29:56.866
you or your crew?

30:02.323 --> 30:04.774
ABBY: You can stare all
you want, but a

30:04.776 --> 30:06.909
watched Mass Spec will not boil.

30:06.911 --> 30:10.946
He's also immune
to wishing, hoping,

30:10.948 --> 30:13.449
willing, most forms of voodoo.

30:13.451 --> 30:15.451
(beeping)

30:16.553 --> 30:19.055
Like I said, most forms.

30:19.057 --> 30:20.540
What do you got, Abbs?

30:20.542 --> 30:22.308
Salt water.

30:22.310 --> 30:25.478
There's no significant sources
of any mechanical pollutants

30:25.480 --> 30:26.846
in your water samples.

30:26.848 --> 30:29.682
Sorry, this is just
not your week.

30:29.684 --> 30:31.634
Hasn't been great
for the Happ family, either.

30:31.636 --> 30:33.135
And it's about to get worse.

30:33.137 --> 30:34.187
How?

30:34.189 --> 30:35.805
McGEE: Pentagon is ready
to issue a statement

30:35.807 --> 30:38.024
blaming the crash
on Happ's suicide attempt.

30:38.026 --> 30:40.243
But the investigation
is still ongoing.

30:40.245 --> 30:42.078
We told them that,
but the longer they wait,

30:42.080 --> 30:43.529
the more it looks like
they're hiding the truth.

30:43.531 --> 30:44.647
ABBY:
Yeah, but

30:44.649 --> 30:46.399
we don't know the truth, do we?

30:46.401 --> 30:48.418
(phone rings)

30:48.420 --> 30:49.452
Lab.
This is Abby.

30:49.454 --> 30:50.870
Does Gibbs know about this?

30:50.872 --> 30:53.006
He and Ziva are headed back
from the <i>Seahawk.</i>

30:53.008 --> 30:55.958
McGEE: Guy's wife and son are about
to be bombarded by media,

30:55.960 --> 30:58.528
and all we have is hearsay
and a couple of bourbon bottles.

30:58.530 --> 31:00.996
And the eyewitness testimony
of two decorated crewmates.

31:00.998 --> 31:02.382
Their stories match.

31:02.384 --> 31:05.167
Well, who's to say
what's the truth, right?

31:05.169 --> 31:07.470
Those guys spent four days
together in a raft.

31:07.472 --> 31:09.055
Am I missing something?

31:09.057 --> 31:10.473
You mean besides
a helicopter?

31:10.475 --> 31:12.141
Or a single straight answer?

31:12.143 --> 31:13.860
Need more than a gut feeling.

31:13.862 --> 31:15.561
ABBY: How about
a third opinion?

31:15.563 --> 31:16.896
That was
the hospital.

31:16.898 --> 31:19.032
Petty Officer Portis is awake.

31:19.034 --> 31:20.283
Game on, McGee.
Let's go.

31:20.285 --> 31:23.018
What about Gibbs?
We'll call on the way.

31:24.354 --> 31:26.539
(quiet, steady beeping)

31:26.541 --> 31:30.376
McGEE: Doctors suspect brain damage
due to the dehydration.

31:30.378 --> 31:32.462
They're not even sure
he can understand them.

31:32.464 --> 31:35.248
Then I guess we'd
better ask the right questions.

31:35.250 --> 31:38.301
McGEE:
Petty Officer Portis,

31:38.303 --> 31:39.702
we're with NCIS.

31:39.704 --> 31:42.038
We're investigating
the crash.

31:47.678 --> 31:49.812
Your crewmates,
Joplin and Sparks,

31:49.814 --> 31:51.881
have each given full accounts.

31:51.883 --> 31:54.049
We're hoping you might
be able to help us confirm

31:54.051 --> 31:56.753
what happened
that night.

31:56.755 --> 32:00.940
Did Lieutenant Commander Happ
try to commit suicide?

32:04.011 --> 32:06.245
(beeping gradually accelerates)

32:06.247 --> 32:08.481
Is that what caused the crash?

32:08.483 --> 32:12.368
(beeping continues accelerating)

32:22.346 --> 32:23.612
Release my clients,
Agent Gibbs.

32:23.614 --> 32:25.247
Pentagon press briefing
is in two hours,

32:25.249 --> 32:27.282
and you have no evidence
to refute their testimony.

32:27.284 --> 32:28.834
Petty Officer
Portis said enough.

32:28.836 --> 32:30.553
Except that he never
actually said anything,

32:30.555 --> 32:32.138
and doctors are saying
partial brain damage.

32:32.140 --> 32:34.423
It's gonna take
a lot more than a hazy nod

32:34.425 --> 32:36.108
to keep this case open.
She's right, Gibbs.

32:36.110 --> 32:37.827
I'll let you know
when we find it.

32:37.829 --> 32:39.895
We have been running
deep background

32:39.897 --> 32:41.797
on the entire squadron,
and found a connection.

32:41.799 --> 32:43.482
Four of them applied
for apostille stamps

32:43.484 --> 32:44.967
in the last month.

32:44.969 --> 32:48.354
A form of federal notary for document
verification. So what?

32:48.356 --> 32:50.322
Well, they're rare,
and usually only needed

32:50.324 --> 32:51.857
to open offshore
bank accounts.

32:51.859 --> 32:53.676
You have proof
that's what it was for?

32:53.678 --> 32:55.695
No, but that's not what
got our attention.

32:55.697 --> 32:56.829
Call the ball, probie.

32:56.831 --> 32:58.313
McGEE:
Of the crew on that helo,

32:58.315 --> 33:00.199
Happ was the only one that
never applied for a stamp.

33:00.201 --> 33:01.333
I thought you said
there were four.

33:01.335 --> 33:02.668
There were--
the fourth was

33:02.670 --> 33:04.453
Squadron Commander Hernandez.

33:05.822 --> 33:07.173
If the crew was
into something together,

33:07.175 --> 33:08.424
then what's his connection?

33:08.426 --> 33:10.342
Well, the final mission report
was just published,

33:10.344 --> 33:12.261
and it includes
personnel rosters.

33:12.263 --> 33:13.963
We knew who was
on that helicopter.

33:13.965 --> 33:15.181
But we didn't know
who was supposed to be.

33:15.183 --> 33:16.482
While Commander
Happ was on duty

33:16.484 --> 33:19.068
that night, he wasn't
originally scheduled to fly.

33:19.070 --> 33:20.553
Hernandez was. Go.

33:20.555 --> 33:22.972
We don't know what any
of this means, Director.

33:22.974 --> 33:24.974
Let you know when we find it.

33:26.560 --> 33:28.360
Looks like your ego
is writing checks

33:28.362 --> 33:29.912
your offshore bank account

33:29.914 --> 33:32.114
can't cash, Commander.

33:32.116 --> 33:33.616
McGEE: What did you
know that kept you

33:33.618 --> 33:36.619
from wanting to fly that night?
Nothing.

33:36.621 --> 33:37.903
I was sick.

33:37.905 --> 33:41.290
I went to see my girlfriend,
and she made me chicken soup.

33:41.292 --> 33:43.392
That's funny-- she said
you went out to dinner

33:43.394 --> 33:44.577
and that you
weren't sick.

33:44.579 --> 33:45.995
Time to change
course, flyboy.

33:45.997 --> 33:47.329
Before you find yourself
crash-landing

33:47.331 --> 33:49.131
in the middle
of a court-martial.

33:49.133 --> 33:50.249
(laughs) That's od one.

33:50.251 --> 33:53.636
You can wear the sunglasses
for a little bit.

33:53.638 --> 33:55.087
McGEE:
That account

33:55.089 --> 33:56.806
wasn't for your
military pension, was it?

33:56.808 --> 33:58.891
(turns page)

33:58.893 --> 34:01.210
Joplin and Sparks planned it.

34:01.212 --> 34:03.712
Nobody was supposed to find out.

34:03.714 --> 34:05.264
Find out about what?

34:05.266 --> 34:08.350
That we were
gonna sell the helo.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.353
Sell it to who?
I don't know.

34:11.355 --> 34:12.888
Joplin said he found a buyer

34:12.889 --> 34:16.242
and everything was set
for that night, but I...

34:16.244 --> 34:18.409
couldn't go through with it

34:18.411 --> 34:20.329
and I called in sick.

34:20.331 --> 34:22.481
Who killed
Lieutenant Commander Happ?

34:22.483 --> 34:24.733
I don't know. I swear.

34:26.101 --> 34:29.972
Joplin and Sparks, they saved
my ass in Afghanistan last year,

34:29.974 --> 34:32.708
and I owe them
my life.

34:32.710 --> 34:34.443
(sighs)

34:34.445 --> 34:38.063
They can't know
that I said anything.

34:39.014 --> 34:41.550
All right?
That's a negative, Ghostrunner.

34:41.552 --> 34:43.853
The pattern's full.

34:49.860 --> 34:51.760
We didn't kill Happ.

34:51.762 --> 34:53.262
We're not
murderers, sir.

34:53.264 --> 34:54.647
Prove it.

34:58.451 --> 35:01.153
Excuse me, Petty Officer.

35:01.155 --> 35:02.872
You can't split them up.

35:02.874 --> 35:05.374
I need to advise
both my clients.

35:05.376 --> 35:06.659
Not if they tell me the truth.

35:06.661 --> 35:08.661
Lieutenant.

35:11.915 --> 35:13.465
Sir...

35:14.450 --> 35:16.585
How much does
a Seahawk go for

35:16.587 --> 35:18.470
these days, Lieutenant?

35:21.457 --> 35:23.292
Three hundred thousand.

35:23.294 --> 35:26.228
Split four ways.

35:27.314 --> 35:29.932
Wow. But only
if it works, right?

35:31.818 --> 35:33.919
I guess if the Coast
Guard can't find it...

35:33.921 --> 35:36.021
Maybe it was not lost
in the first place.

35:37.924 --> 35:39.675
There was no crash.

35:41.611 --> 35:42.862
We faked it.

35:42.864 --> 35:43.979
JOPLIN:
<i>Tower, we're experiencing</i>

35:43.981 --> 35:45.531
radar altimeter failure!

35:45.533 --> 35:46.615
Happ, we're losing altitude!

35:46.617 --> 35:48.834
I lost the horizon!
I lost the horizon!

35:48.836 --> 35:50.069
Pull up! Pull up!

35:50.071 --> 35:52.872
SPARKS: Comms are cut!
They can't hear us!

35:52.874 --> 35:56.792
We flew south and landed
on a ship waiting to meet us.

35:56.794 --> 35:59.395
We'd get our money,

35:59.397 --> 36:01.363
set off in the raft

36:01.365 --> 36:03.599
and wait for rescue teams.

36:03.601 --> 36:05.517
30-year-old helo
being phased out of service,

36:05.519 --> 36:08.220
nobody would miss it.
We all agreed to the plan.

36:08.222 --> 36:09.855
Until Hernandez backed out.

36:09.857 --> 36:11.390
Everything else
was in place,

36:11.392 --> 36:14.343
so we took a chance and told
Happ once we were in the air.

36:14.345 --> 36:17.029
You knew he could use
the money for his son,

36:17.031 --> 36:18.814
and against three
armed crew members,

36:18.816 --> 36:20.282
he would not have much choice.

36:20.284 --> 36:21.850
You threatened him.
No!

36:21.852 --> 36:24.236
He went along with it
on his own.

36:24.238 --> 36:25.654
Or so we thought.

36:25.656 --> 36:26.956
JOPLIN:
<i>But once we landed,</i>

36:26.958 --> 36:28.557
Happ pulled his weapon on us.

36:28.559 --> 36:29.975
HAPP:
We're not doing this!

36:29.977 --> 36:32.461
I want your weapons
on the deck now!

36:32.463 --> 36:34.046
And your .22, Sparks!

36:34.048 --> 36:37.416
JOPLIN: Come on, Happ, don't blow this.
The plan is gonna work!

36:37.418 --> 36:40.386
Said he wasn't gonna lie to his
country or his family like that.

36:40.388 --> 36:42.554
No, he stood up
to all three of you.

36:43.757 --> 36:45.624
So you shot him?
No.

36:45.626 --> 36:47.559
It was the boat captain.

36:47.561 --> 36:49.461
(distorted scream)

36:49.463 --> 36:51.263
(distorted yell)

36:52.666 --> 36:54.767
We should've stopped it there,

36:54.769 --> 36:55.935
called off the deal.

36:55.937 --> 36:58.320
But you took the money
in offshore accounts.

37:00.023 --> 37:01.740
The captain was

37:01.742 --> 37:04.159
supposed to drop us
near where we faked the crash.

37:04.161 --> 37:05.995
But the murder changed things?

37:05.997 --> 37:09.731
He disabled
the transponders

37:09.733 --> 37:11.667
<i>and just dumped us.</i>

37:11.669 --> 37:14.269
<i>We were nowhere near</i>
<i>the search grid.</i>

37:14.271 --> 37:17.106
(sobbing):
We deserved it.

37:17.108 --> 37:19.541
I need a name, Lieutenant.

37:20.727 --> 37:22.177
JOPLIN:
<i>The buyer was Shamus Quinn.</i>

37:22.179 --> 37:24.680
<i>Met him at the marina</i>
<i>where I keep my boat.</i>

37:24.682 --> 37:28.684
In Virginia Beach.

37:29.519 --> 37:30.752
Call Borin.

37:30.754 --> 37:32.972
Have her lock it down.

37:37.811 --> 37:40.612
Got an update?
Yeah. This warehouse is the only address

37:40.614 --> 37:42.264
listed under Quinn's name.

37:42.266 --> 37:43.615
Are you sure
he's in here?

37:43.617 --> 37:45.317
Yeah. we got movement in
the back office, and no one's

37:45.319 --> 37:46.652
been in or out
since you called.

37:46.654 --> 37:49.104
Let's move.

37:49.106 --> 37:51.606
Spread out.

37:51.608 --> 37:53.742
BORIN (whispers):
Ziva, stairs.

37:53.744 --> 37:56.578
(gunshots)

38:07.540 --> 38:09.591
(grunting)

38:11.644 --> 38:13.729
Get off me!
Come here!

38:13.731 --> 38:14.763
Get off me!

38:14.765 --> 38:15.964
Settle down, Hemingway.

38:15.966 --> 38:17.983
You got him?
Yeah.

38:17.985 --> 38:19.818
TONY: Same model
as Sparks' gun.

38:19.820 --> 38:21.603
It's got to be
the murder weapon.

38:21.605 --> 38:23.605
(grunts)

38:23.607 --> 38:25.140
Here we go.

38:25.142 --> 38:26.275
(clicks tongue)

38:26.277 --> 38:28.110
TONY:
Nice job, McMan.

38:28.112 --> 38:30.195
BORIN:
Since we found the missing helo

38:30.197 --> 38:32.481
on Quinn's boat, my review
is looking pretty good,

38:32.483 --> 38:34.666
so how about a drink on me
as professionals?

38:34.668 --> 38:36.151
Oh, have to take
a rain check.

38:36.153 --> 38:37.753
You know, we kind of
have plans already.

38:37.755 --> 38:39.455
Friday night.
Hot dates, huh?

38:39.457 --> 38:42.041
ZIVA:
Yes! Playing video games. Ha!

38:42.043 --> 38:43.425
You never went to the bar.

38:43.427 --> 38:44.826
You stayed home
playing with yourselves.

38:44.828 --> 38:46.762
I mean...

38:46.764 --> 38:48.013
with each other.

38:48.015 --> 38:50.682
I mean...

38:50.684 --> 38:51.967
(sighs)

38:51.969 --> 38:53.852
McGee, I read your e-mails.

38:53.854 --> 38:56.271
You broke in to my computer?
How do you know my password?

38:56.273 --> 38:57.556
Boss, she's not allowed
to do that.

38:57.558 --> 38:59.841
Truth will out, DiNozzo.
ZIVA: Right.

38:59.843 --> 39:01.443
Let's hear it.

39:01.445 --> 39:03.195
TONY: Well, we had every
intention of going out,

39:03.197 --> 39:04.679
and when I went
by McGeek's place,

39:04.681 --> 39:06.315
he... he was still...

39:06.317 --> 39:08.283
enthralled by this-this
first-person shooter game.

39:08.285 --> 39:10.235
It was pretty
cool, actually.

39:10.237 --> 39:12.855
That would explain
your newfound combat tactics.

39:12.857 --> 39:14.907
McGEE: Look, don't
blame me, Tony.

39:14.909 --> 39:16.525
You were the one
that wanted to stay

39:16.527 --> 39:17.793
once I found
that sorority sister

39:17.795 --> 39:19.361
"capture the flag"
battalion.

39:19.363 --> 39:20.963
(chuckles):
Oh, they-they were hot.

39:20.965 --> 39:22.197
They sounded hot.

39:22.199 --> 39:23.465
Ziva.

39:24.417 --> 39:26.652
Drink?
Yes.

39:28.254 --> 39:30.773
ZIVA:
Thank you.

39:30.775 --> 39:35.043
Finally, someone has the decency
to ask me to join them.

39:35.979 --> 39:37.396
BORIN:
Gibbs.

39:37.398 --> 39:39.681
That's what
this was about?

39:41.017 --> 39:42.768
She set us up
because we didn't

39:42.770 --> 39:44.553
ask her out
in the first place.

39:44.555 --> 39:45.754
How did we miss that?

39:45.756 --> 39:48.056
The better question is:
How are you gonna fix it?

39:50.243 --> 39:52.411
(elevator bell dings)
Hold that door!

39:52.413 --> 39:53.728
Oh!

39:53.730 --> 39:55.397
I'm in.
I'm in.

39:55.399 --> 39:58.117
(elevator bell dings)

39:58.119 --> 40:01.370
♪

40:27.313 --> 40:28.864
Game on.
