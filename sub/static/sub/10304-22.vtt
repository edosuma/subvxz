01:57.360 --> 02:02.388
And now, Friends,
followed by The Making of Friends.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.477
And then, on the 1 0.00 news...

02:04.720 --> 02:09.874
... the cast of Cheers discusses
their fav ourite episodes of Friends.

02:10.919 --> 02:14.913
Kelly, can we please watch
something else? This is a rerun.

02:15.160 --> 02:19.472
No, it's not.
l've seen this one a million times.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.675
Hey, Dad, you're off work early?

02:30.920 --> 02:32.751
l'm always off at this time.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.197
l just never came home before
because your mother was here.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.437
-What are you watching?
-Friends.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.796
Friends.
Don't have them, don't need them...

02:43.000 --> 02:45.230
...sure as hell
don't wanna watch them.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.431
How can anyone not love this show?

02:48.680 --> 02:52.070
l mean, there's nothing on TV
quite like Friends.

02:52.560 --> 02:55.279
Now, stay tuned for Buddies.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.549
Next up, Homeys.

03:04.640 --> 03:07.712
Geezers, starring Bill Cosby.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.919
Welcome back to Friends.

03:10.160 --> 03:13.835
Sponsored by the new Friends
Las Vegas Hotel and Casino.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.196
l wanna go. Oh, l wanna go.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.750
Well, that satellite dish
was money well spent...

03:21.000 --> 03:24.629
...like the wedding ring
and the smoke detectors.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.353
Yeah, l'm going down to my room.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.676
l have absolutely no interest
in this show.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.673
Yeah, well, you would
if it was called Rubber Friends.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.756
Daddy, can you get that?
lt might be the door.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.913
My kingdom for a drive-by.

03:51.880 --> 03:55.839
-l've got something for a Peggy Bundy.
-So do l.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.872
Oh, then l guess you don't want...

04:00.080 --> 04:03.311
...these Big 'Uns centrefold
Popsicle moulds either?

04:04.440 --> 04:06.192
Are you crazy?
l ordered those. Give me.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.035
Yeah, you're gonna love them,
and here's a tip:

04:10.280 --> 04:14.512
lf you only fill the trays to the neck,
they come out without heads.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.028
-Hi there.
-Hi.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.231
-What you watching?
-Friends.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.833
Friends.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.991
-Mind if l sit here anyway?
-No.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.832
No, make yourself at home.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.953
l'd get you a beer, but l don't
wanna be caught empty-handed...

04:30.160 --> 04:32.310
...when the gardener
and chimney sweep drop by.

04:35.080 --> 04:40.791
Well, my dad's gone.
You can sit a little bit closer.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.798
''Tom.''

04:46.880 --> 04:49.952
That's a great name.
Were you named after anybody?

04:50.200 --> 04:53.237
-Yeah, yeah, my father.
-Oh, cool. What's his name?

04:58.840 --> 05:02.276
l'm Kelly. l don't wear a nametag.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.630
l wasn't looking for one.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.076
-Well, then, what were you looking for?
-This.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.269
What was that? A lip alarm?

05:18.160 --> 05:21.391
Sort of. See, l'm being paged
by my girlfriend, Shannon.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.750
lf l don't check in with her
every 1 5 minutes...

05:23.960 --> 05:26.190
...she gets this crazy idea
l'm cheating on her.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.633
Question Number 1 2:

05:29.840 --> 05:31.432
How many times this week...

05:31.640 --> 05:35.394
...has your man come home late
with a lame excuse?

05:38.280 --> 05:40.794
Hi, sweetie. Sorry l'm late.

05:41.400 --> 05:45.313
l got the clock in my truck
confused with the speedometer.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.192
Seven.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.792
Oh, hell.
She's taking the Cosmo quiz.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.268
What is it this month, baby?

05:54.520 --> 05:57.318
'' How to kiss your way
into his living will''?

05:57.560 --> 06:00.358
No. lt's called,
'' How to tell if you and your man--''

06:00.600 --> 06:04.513
That's you.
''--are in a dying relationship.''

06:04.760 --> 06:08.116
-Well, are we?
-Well, l'll know in a minute.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.039
-Hey, what's seven times four?
-Twenty-eight.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.550
Oh, yeah, we're dead.

06:15.120 --> 06:18.635
Come on. You can't trust Cosmo.
They hate men.

06:19.120 --> 06:22.078
Well, you know, Tom,
it's not just the quiz.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.072
l followed you this afternoon.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.356
l thought you were doing
makeovers at Macy's.

06:26.600 --> 06:30.957
Yeah, l was. But l told them
that l needed a personal stalking day.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.400
Anyway, l saw you go
into a cute blond girl's house.

06:35.960 --> 06:40.750
So? Come on. l'm a delivery guy.
l go into people's houses.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.594
Sometimes they're girls.
Sometimes they're cute.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.916
-Sometimes you sleep with them.
-Yeah.

06:49.080 --> 06:53.437
But not today.
Today, l was faithful to you.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.716
You just don't get it, do you?

06:55.960 --> 06:57.951
Not since you subscribed
to Cosmo, no.

06:59.840 --> 07:03.310
Oh, yeah? Well, it's a lot better
than those lovemaking tips...

07:03.520 --> 07:05.636
...you get from Popular Mechanics.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.428
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.677
Nice mood.
Did my brother cheat on you again?

07:14.920 --> 07:17.912
Yes. Tom and l
are in the middle of the biggest fight...

07:18.120 --> 07:20.475
...we've had since yesterday.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.075
Then why are you bothering
to wax your legs?

07:24.360 --> 07:27.397
Don't they teach you anything
at night school?

07:27.640 --> 07:31.872
lf Tom and l make up, we'll end up
in bed, and he'll want smooth legs.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.759
lf we break up, l'll end up in bed
with somebody else...

07:34.960 --> 07:36.552
...and he'll want smooth legs.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.236
So either way,
waxing is the key to my happiness.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.910
Bastards!

07:46.400 --> 07:48.152
Well, good evening, ladies.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.756
You know, after a long, hard day,
there's nothing like a relaxing shower.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.913
Jackson, why do you need a shower?
You don't work.

07:56.240 --> 08:00.313
l get just as dirty watching TV
as you do working.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.155
Sure. Now that you've unscrambled
the porn channel.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.038
At least l have a sex life.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.431
Which reminds me,
you're out of liquid soap.

08:21.040 --> 08:24.316
Look, Shannon,
l'm sorry about our fight.

08:24.560 --> 08:29.031
And to make up for it,
l bought you a present.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.193
lt better be good.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.960
-What are those?
-Hey, it's 9:00 at night.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.111
lt was either this
or a Polish sausage.

08:43.400 --> 08:49.157
Look, Tom, l'm sure, in your eyes,
these were a very sweet gesture.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.111
l need more than a gesture.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.797
l knew l should've gone
with the sausage.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.632
Look, Tom...

09:00.880 --> 09:03.030
...Cosmo says
that l'm an under-dater.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.635
No problem.
Tonight, you can be on top.

09:07.840 --> 09:12.868
What l mean is,
is that a girl like me has big dreams.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.510
l shouldn't be dating you.
l should be dating your boss.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.550
You did date his boss.

09:21.720 --> 09:22.675
You did?

09:22.880 --> 09:25.110
Yeah. How do you think
you got your promotion?

09:25.360 --> 09:27.954
l thought it was
because l dated his wife.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.556
You know, l don't know
what keeps me here...

09:34.760 --> 09:37.877
...when there's a city
full of middle-aged rich men...

09:38.080 --> 09:41.436
...just one drink away from infidelity.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.755
l know what keeps you here.

09:48.040 --> 09:49.314
Forget it, Tom.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.030
You know, the TV Guide horoscope
was right.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.073
l have no business
living with a Libra.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.992
We are so through.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.078
You can't leave like this.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.317
We haven't had sex today.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.394
Speak for yourself!

10:18.360 --> 10:22.876
Tom, l know you're feeling upset
about Shannon leaving...

10:23.080 --> 10:27.790
...but you'll feel better
if you stop sulking and do something.

10:35.040 --> 10:38.157
-You're right. l do feel better.
-What did you do?

10:38.400 --> 10:40.550
Smashed her porcelain cat
collection.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.676
Look, Tom, obviously
you're feeling hurt right now.

10:45.960 --> 10:49.191
Hurt?
Come on, that's a girlie thing.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.631
l'm feeling the guy version
of hurt: horny.

10:55.120 --> 11:00.035
You know, that's also the guy version
of happy, curious, and sleepy.

11:00.560 --> 11:04.519
ln fact, is there ever a moment
when you guys aren't horny?

11:05.200 --> 11:07.316
Prostate exams.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.510
And the '' lt's a Small World'' ride.

11:13.600 --> 11:18.435
No, just prostate exams. l forgot
about those little Polynesian girls.

11:20.080 --> 11:24.039
You know what? You're no better
than your skirt-chasing father.

11:24.280 --> 11:27.795
Hey, it was your mother who walked
into a married man's house...

11:28.000 --> 11:29.797
...in that little maid's outfit.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.759
She was the maid, you idiot.

11:33.320 --> 11:36.039
Still, l am not like him.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.875
l know the first name of almost
every woman l've ever slept with.

11:40.120 --> 11:43.635
And with any luck,
l'm about to learn a new one.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.629
Keiko, pick up.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.600
All right. All right.
Give it to me. l got it.

12:07.040 --> 12:11.079
Wow, Jefferson,
this is a real soul experience.

12:11.320 --> 12:14.073
Not some fake yuppie hangout.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.232
We are down with the people.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.670
You're not wearing
that Rolex l gave you, are you?

12:24.880 --> 12:28.111
Oh, no, no. l sold that long ago.

12:29.320 --> 12:31.550
l mean, it's too precious
to ever wear.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.750
Yo there, bro.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.475
We're new to the 'hood.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.639
What can you recommend?

12:51.520 --> 12:53.715
The hamburgers.

12:54.720 --> 12:58.998
Well, we were hoping
for something a little bit more...

12:59.720 --> 13:00.835
...down home.

13:03.240 --> 13:07.199
You know, like collard greens,
oxtails, moon pies.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.829
l'm glad you've seen Martin...

13:11.040 --> 13:15.272
...but here, we serve hamburgers.

13:15.720 --> 13:16.948
Listen, homes.

13:21.080 --> 13:25.312
lf you insist on dissing
your customers...

13:25.960 --> 13:27.234
...in that manner...

13:27.440 --> 13:31.194
...then we are just going to have to
ease on down that road.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.634
Word.

13:43.680 --> 13:48.993
Well, then, l guess
you want your order to go.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.913
There.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.276
Your mama.

14:06.560 --> 14:10.599
George, hi.
l've never been a waitress before.

14:10.840 --> 14:14.913
When customers leave money
on the table, who is it for?

14:18.280 --> 14:20.032
lt's for me.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.516
lt's their way of showing appreciation
for the guy who cooked the food.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.118
l have so much to learn.

14:35.680 --> 14:39.514
-George, meet Kelly.
-Oh, hey, Kelly.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.153
Welcome to George's Diner.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.112
Place where
everybody knows your name...

14:43.320 --> 14:45.276
...but is rude to you just the same.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.790
Just like my house.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.234
So, Tom.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.357
-Excuse me.
-Oh, sure.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.033
Did you and Shannon break up...

14:54.280 --> 14:56.589
...or is she just out of town?

14:56.840 --> 14:58.671
No, she's in town.

14:58.920 --> 15:03.118
No doubt crying into a pint
of Chunky Monkey over losing me.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.435
Hi, Tom.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.399
Hi, Shannon. What brings you here?

15:23.640 --> 15:25.835
A Jaguar.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.071
Owned by Henry.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.712
l'm Henry.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.754
My other car is a yacht.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.389
So you gonna introduce me
to your little friend?

15:40.640 --> 15:43.598
-Kelly, meet Shannon.
-Oh, hi.

15:43.840 --> 15:47.196
She's the woman l used to go home to
after my dates.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.909
Henry, meet Tom. He's the guy
who thought l stayed home...

15:53.120 --> 15:55.270
...while he went out
with other women.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.871
lt's good to see
that people can break up...

15:58.080 --> 16:00.958
...and still remain such good friends.

16:02.160 --> 16:05.914
-So where did you two meet?
-At Macy's.

16:06.160 --> 16:07.878
l was there to buy a gift for my wife.

16:08.080 --> 16:11.072
And l thought l'd pick up
a little something for me.

16:13.440 --> 16:18.150
Excuse me, George,
Kelly and l would like a table for two.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.153
Henry and l
would like a table for one.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.197
And l'd like to pass
a health inspection.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.556
So good luck to all of us.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.713
Kelly, when l'm with you...

16:36.960 --> 16:39.713
...l feel like you're the only woman
in the world.

16:42.400 --> 16:46.552
She's holding his hand,
right in front of me.

16:46.800 --> 16:51.430
So what? l thought l was
the only woman in the world.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.954
l'm sorry, did you say something?

18:02.640 --> 18:04.198
Excuse me.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.556
People eat there.

18:07.360 --> 18:11.751
Oh, Henry. l'm really turned on.

18:12.040 --> 18:14.395
Let's make love.

18:14.680 --> 18:17.399
Shall we do it in the Jag,
or do you wanna go to my condo?

18:17.680 --> 18:21.753
No. Let's go someplace
really romantic.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.275
The bathroom.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.592
Come on.
Let's go to the bathroom too.

18:36.680 --> 18:40.036
Okay, l'll try,
but l don't think l have to go.

18:44.200 --> 18:48.352
Oh, Henry. Please blow on my neck.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.876
Not you.

18:52.040 --> 18:56.591
Oh, yes. Right there.

18:56.960 --> 19:01.192
You know, in this light, you remind me
of my fourth wife's daughter.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.589
Oh, Kelly, you're the best.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.639
This is really fun.

19:17.840 --> 19:21.879
But could you wait outside
because now l really have to go.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.680
Hold on. l'm not done
impressing Shannon.

19:24.920 --> 19:28.117
Well, let me know if there's anything
l can do to just hurry it along.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.318
Oh, Henry.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.074
Look. You can moan like Shannon.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.880
Oh, Henry.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.434
-''Oh, Henry''?
-''Oh, Henry''?

19:46.680 --> 19:51.708
l mean, oh, Tom.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.199
-Oh, Kelly, lower.
-Oh, Henry, higher.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.516
Oh, Edwin. Take me to the bathroom.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.428
That's it.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.796
No. That's it.

20:14.040 --> 20:17.350
-l'm there.
-No, l'm there.

20:17.600 --> 20:21.388
You can't be there. l'm the only one
who can take you there.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.798
You know, l'll tell you one thing.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.595
l am not going on a second date
with Tom.

20:40.320 --> 20:42.038
No, you shouldn't.

20:42.240 --> 20:46.028
A woman like you deserves a man
who respects women.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.432
Nice legs.

20:49.280 --> 20:52.078
You wanna get in my Jag
and go shopping?

20:52.320 --> 20:54.117
Sure.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.833
Could you just wait one minute?

20:56.040 --> 20:59.077
Because l really
have to use the bathroom.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.472
Daddy...

21:08.640 --> 21:11.598
...l want you to meet Henry.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.476
Pumpkin, what did we say
about talking to Daddy?

21:19.880 --> 21:22.792
l'm watching
my new favourite TV show.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.632
Friends?

21:25.560 --> 21:27.676
Dad, l thought you hated this show.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.512
l do.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.115
But if you mute the sound...

21:33.360 --> 21:35.590
...and watch with binoculars...

21:37.440 --> 21:42.514
...you can see that Jennifer Aniston
isn't wearing a bra.

21:57.040 --> 22:00.112
This really is must-see TV.
