us exactly what happened

Yeah, but what if we're

Castor helped us defeat black cyper

unleash it on Edendale.

He's worked hard to gain my trust.

03:32.901 --> 03:34.934
There's got to be some sort of explanation.

03:34.936 --> 03:36.602
- For murdering someone?
- Please.

I've had to live with
this secret for ten years.

05:04.635 --> 05:07.102
Humans and Atrians both believe

05:07.104 --> 05:08.601
we crashed because of pilot error.

05:08.603 --> 05:09.968
But the truth is we crashed

that we were not to land
on an inhabited planet.

05:15.009 --> 05:17.841
But the pilot and the copilot, Saroya,

05:17.843 --> 05:20.011
disobeyed your father,

05:20.013 --> 05:21.915

to turn the ship around,

05:32.561 --> 05:35.364
I had no choice but to shoot him.

05:35.366 --> 05:36.534
But then the ship crashed.

05:36.536 --> 05:37.936
No.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.371
Saroya fought me,
determined to land on Earth.

05:40.373 --> 05:43.341
That's when she lost control of the ship.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.677
She's a dangerous woman, Roman.

05:44.679 --> 05:46.279
Years ago, she was sent to the Crate

Why are you so eager to?

should be thanking me.

10:30.605 --> 10:34.105
If it wasn't for us, you'd be
in a lot more trouble right now.

10:56.465 --> 10:59.103
(Grunts)

10:59.105 --> 11:00.638
I know why you're here.

11:00.640 --> 11:02.510
(Winces)

11:07.141 --> 11:08.207
(Roman groans)

11:08.209 --> 11:09.941
Stop! What are you doing?!

11:09.943 --> 11:11.978
Nox would be ashamed of you!

11:11.980 --> 11:13.479
Mom, what are you saying?

11:13.481 --> 11:15.778
- Castor was right about you.
- Castor's a liar!

11:15.780 --> 11:18.381
Everything that comes out of
that Trag's mouth is poison!

11:18.383 --> 11:21.150
I saw what happened the night
that the ship crashed. Huh?

11:21.152 --> 11:23.938
Castor shot the pilot to
put a stop to your mutiny!

11:23.988 --> 11:25.995
- You saw?
- All right, somebody better

11:26.045 --> 11:27.121
tell me what the hell's going on here.

11:27.123 --> 11:29.553
I left the flight recorder
on your dostep... the mirzan.

11:29.555 --> 11:30.988
Do you have it?

11:30.990 --> 11:32.290
You left it?

11:32.292 --> 11:33.760
As soon as I returned to the Sector,

11:33.762 --> 11:35.294
I tried to get it to your father.

11:35.296 --> 11:36.828
I needed to expose Castor.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.930
He was the one who disobeyed Nox's orders.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.599
He was the one who caused the crash!

11:40.601 --> 11:42.536
Why should I believe
you? You just attacked me!

11:42.538 --> 11:45.702
Why would I want to
give the flight recorder

11:45.704 --> 11:48.637
to Nox if it would prove my own guilt?

11:50.007 --> 11:51.509
All right, I've heard enough.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.808
Let's go. Come on.

11:53.810 --> 11:56.944
You come into my pod and
accuse my mother of mutiny?

11:56.946 --> 11:59.480
- Castor said that she and the pilot...
- Enough about Castor!

11:59.482 --> 12:01.615
Nox was smart enough
not to blindly trust him.

12:01.617 --> 12:02.948
- Why the hell would you?
- I trust Castor

12:02.950 --> 12:04.183
'cause he works to keep Trags

12:04.185 --> 12:05.720
like you on a leash!

12:06.989 --> 12:10.026
Nice to know where your
loyalties lie, brother.

12:21.038 --> 12:22.039
Oh, God, what happened?

12:22.041 --> 12:23.508
It's not every day

12:23.510 --> 12:25.780
you get attacked by your best friend's mom.

12:25.782 --> 12:27.616
- Roman, I'm so sorry. I had no idea...
- No, no, no.

12:27.618 --> 12:31.018
You were right. I needed to
get her side of the story.

12:31.020 --> 12:33.153
So Castor was telling the
truth; she's dangerous.

12:33.155 --> 12:36.152
Well, that's what I thought.

12:36.154 --> 12:38.255
There was something she said.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.257
What?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.492
She was the one who left

12:40.494 --> 12:41.658
the mirzan for my father,

12:41.660 --> 12:43.258
before she found out he was dead.

12:43.260 --> 12:44.525
But why would she do that?

12:44.527 --> 12:46.027
To show my father

12:46.029 --> 12:47.596
what really happened the
night the ship crashed.

12:47.598 --> 12:49.366
Which means she probably wasn't

12:49.368 --> 12:50.931
the one disobeying orders.

12:50.933 --> 12:52.532
Exactly.

12:53.367 --> 12:55.302
So, what now?

12:55.304 --> 12:57.239
I need to talk to the Hwatab,
council of tribal elders,

12:57.241 --> 12:58.807
tell them what I've seen.

12:58.809 --> 13:01.209
I don't think you should
be doing this alone.

13:01.211 --> 13:03.811
Especially when you don't
know who you can trust.

13:03.813 --> 13:06.414
It's the only way I can find out
who's really telling the truth.

13:07.483 --> 13:09.550
Look, I will meet you at The Mud Bug

13:09.552 --> 13:11.286
right after I talk to them.

13:11.288 --> 13:14.089
I don't want you to worry about anything.

13:15.158 --> 13:16.991
Other than scoping out the best place

13:16.993 --> 13:18.728
for us to watch the meteor shower.

13:18.730 --> 13:20.964
Okay?

13:23.434 --> 13:25.136
(School bell ringing)

13:27.875 --> 13:29.409
Castor knew I wasn't gonna expose him

13:29.411 --> 13:32.615
ten years ago, not with
a young child to protect.

13:32.617 --> 13:34.353
But now, he's running scared.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.723
It's only a matter of time before he sends

13:36.725 --> 13:38.459
his assassins for us.

13:39.396 --> 13:41.599
Mom, I'm not a child anymore.

13:41.601 --> 13:43.334
I can protect you.

13:43.336 --> 13:44.736
No.

13:44.738 --> 13:46.805
No, you can't.

13:46.807 --> 13:49.838
(Loud knocking)

13:55.778 --> 13:57.780
(Loud knocking)

14:01.757 --> 14:04.660
Is this how you greet all your guests?

14:05.727 --> 14:07.159
What do you want, Teri?

14:07.161 --> 14:09.359
My mother asked me to summon you.

14:09.361 --> 14:10.694
Both of you.

14:14.932 --> 14:16.901
♪♪

14:16.903 --> 14:19.770
How many of these do we have left?

14:19.772 --> 14:22.738
Uh, until we run out of stars.

14:23.940 --> 14:26.007
I thought you were excited for this party.

14:26.009 --> 14:27.609
I am.

14:27.611 --> 14:29.143
It's just... it's the event of the season.

14:29.145 --> 14:30.212
I don't know why anyone

14:30.214 --> 14:31.848
wouldn't want to be there.

14:31.850 --> 14:34.517
Okay.

14:36.154 --> 14:37.686
I just hate being sidelined.

14:37.688 --> 14:39.855
I mean, it's like you
find this really sexy,

14:39.857 --> 14:41.590
crush-worthy...

14:42.658 --> 14:43.657
pair of kitten heels,

14:43.659 --> 14:45.026
and then you discover no matter

14:45.028 --> 14:46.894
how hard you try to break
them in, they keep on

14:46.896 --> 14:50.564
resisting you and won't open up to you.

14:50.566 --> 14:52.500
You know what I mean?

14:52.502 --> 14:54.800
I don't think you can get
really close to someone

14:54.802 --> 14:56.936
until they're completely honest with you.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.105
And vice versa.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.240
GRAYSON: Hey, Taylor?

15:02.242 --> 15:03.574
Can I talk to you?

15:03.576 --> 15:05.409
Sure.

15:06.246 --> 15:07.682
Privately?

15:08.583 --> 15:09.617
It's okay.

15:09.619 --> 15:11.183
I'll finish these.

15:20.097 --> 15:23.936
I know you guys just broke
up, but damn, Grayson.

15:23.938 --> 15:25.804
She is not a leper.

15:25.806 --> 15:27.206
It's complicated.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.377
Have you heard from Zoe at all?

15:30.379 --> 15:31.845
Nope.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.882
And that's not at all strange to you?

15:33.884 --> 15:35.719
I mean, she is your best friend.

15:39.121 --> 15:40.787
Drake tracked her down for me and found out

15:40.789 --> 15:42.455
that her family moved up north

15:42.457 --> 15:44.624
after they were evicted.
I didn't want to tell anyone

15:44.626 --> 15:47.560
'cause I knew she'd be really
embarrassed if people found out.

15:47.562 --> 15:50.029
So Drake saw her?

15:50.031 --> 15:52.564
And then she told him this?

15:52.566 --> 15:54.031
Yeah, last week. Why?

15:54.033 --> 15:55.899
I think something else

15:55.901 --> 15:57.567
may have been going on with Zoe.

15:57.569 --> 15:59.935
And I need your help.

15:59.937 --> 16:02.104
Just for a few hours.

16:03.773 --> 16:05.438
Okay.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.875
But I have to be back at my
house by 8:00 p.m. to get ready.

16:07.877 --> 16:10.446
This doesn't just happen.

16:22.463 --> 16:25.064
It's been a long time, Saroya.

16:25.066 --> 16:27.133
How are you finding

16:27.135 --> 16:29.570
your transition after eight
years in a hot dry cell?

16:29.572 --> 16:31.739
- Was it that long?
- If only you'd pledged yourself

16:31.741 --> 16:33.641
to the Trags like I had advised.

16:33.643 --> 16:35.878
- We could have protected you.
- I stopped listening to you

16:35.880 --> 16:37.647
the day you went from
being my closest friend

16:37.649 --> 16:39.149
to being a terrorist.

16:39.151 --> 16:41.656
Luckily, Drake doesn't
share your stubbornness.

16:41.658 --> 16:43.657
What are you talking about?

16:43.659 --> 16:45.958
Oh, he didn't tell you.

16:45.960 --> 16:47.459
As the new leader of the Trags,

16:47.461 --> 16:49.294
one of my first orders of business

16:49.296 --> 16:51.362
was to recruit your son.

16:56.202 --> 16:58.273
Why are we here, Vega?

16:58.275 --> 17:00.042
You are here because I made it so.

17:00.044 --> 17:04.178
I am responsible for getting
you released from the Crate.

17:07.184 --> 17:08.483
You did this?

17:08.486 --> 17:09.885
After so many died in the crash,

17:09.887 --> 17:11.086
you, Saroya,

17:11.088 --> 17:13.121
are our most experienced engineer

17:13.123 --> 17:14.888
in the Sector. The only reason

17:14.891 --> 17:16.123
the Humans have the upper hand is

17:16.125 --> 17:18.156
because they greatly outnumber us.

17:18.157 --> 17:21.662
That is why we need you to build the device

17:21.664 --> 17:23.463
to correct this imbalance.

17:23.464 --> 17:25.165
The Suvek.

17:26.601 --> 17:29.235
- What's a Suvek?
- This doesn't concern you.

17:30.369 --> 17:31.969
I have no interest

17:31.971 --> 17:34.105
in starting a war with the Humans.

17:35.341 --> 17:37.340
What makes you think I
would do that for you?

17:37.342 --> 17:39.140
Because you have enemies in the Sector...

17:39.142 --> 17:41.110
people who believe you crashed our ship.

17:42.379 --> 17:43.411
I can protect you.

17:43.413 --> 17:45.078
And your son.

17:47.183 --> 17:50.155
Like I said, I stopped
listening to you a long time ago.

17:50.157 --> 17:52.756
And I'd rather go back to that hot dry cell

17:52.758 --> 17:54.958
than help the Trags.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.172
Hey. Are you coming to
Taylor's party tonight?

18:07.174 --> 18:09.409
I need to go see the Hwatab.

18:09.411 --> 18:11.077
Is everything okay?

18:11.079 --> 18:12.646
Yeah, it's fine.

18:12.648 --> 18:13.884
Go to the party.

18:13.886 --> 18:15.552
I'll meet you there when I can.

18:15.554 --> 18:17.719
Okay.

18:20.458 --> 18:23.061
When were you gonna tell
me you joined the Trags?

18:23.063 --> 18:25.297
I'm not with them anymore;
I just have to pretend to be.

18:25.299 --> 18:27.366
I thought I could trust Vega;
she used to be your friend.

18:27.368 --> 18:29.068
Yeah, and Roman used to be yours.

18:29.070 --> 18:30.870
You see how quickly people can turn?

18:30.872 --> 18:31.971
Vega promised to get you
released from the Crate,

18:31.973 --> 18:32.972
and she delivered.

18:32.974 --> 18:34.274
Don't you get it?

18:34.276 --> 18:36.043
Every choice I have ever made,

18:36.045 --> 18:39.079
down to turning my back on my
best friend, has been for you.

18:39.081 --> 18:40.812
I raised you better than this.

18:40.814 --> 18:42.750
You didn't raise me at all.

18:42.752 --> 18:44.085
You were gone.

18:53.161 --> 18:54.761
Roman.

18:55.863 --> 18:57.864
What brings you here?

18:59.933 --> 19:01.867
I came to find the Hwatab.

19:03.503 --> 19:05.202
With Saroya back in the Sector,

19:05.204 --> 19:07.437
and after everything that
you told me about her,

19:07.439 --> 19:09.140
I thought I should warn them

19:09.142 --> 19:11.712
that she could be dangerous.

19:12.581 --> 19:13.615
Oh.

19:13.617 --> 19:15.650
I see.

19:15.652 --> 19:17.186
But if they're not here, I should go.

19:17.188 --> 19:18.822
I promised I would meet someone.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.125
I'm afraid that's not gonna be possible.

19:21.150 --> 19:22.650
_

19:33.514 --> 19:35.047
Where are the Hwatab?

19:35.097 --> 19:37.740
I alerted them to some urgent
matter inside the Sector

19:37.790 --> 19:39.661
so that you and I could
straighten some things out

19:39.663 --> 19:41.999
without any distractions.

19:42.001 --> 19:43.702
You were gonna tell them

19:43.704 --> 19:45.804
what you saw on the flight
recorder, weren't you?

19:47.572 --> 19:49.874
Where is it?

19:49.876 --> 19:51.611
The mirzan?

19:51.613 --> 19:54.847
You said Saroya was part
of the mutiny on the ship.

19:56.617 --> 19:59.486
She said she left the
mirzan for my father to see.

19:59.488 --> 20:02.155
But why would she do
that if she was guilty?

20:02.157 --> 20:06.497
I was hoping it wouldn't
come down to this, Roman.

20:06.499 --> 20:10.265
The truth is, we had to
find an inhabitable planet,

20:10.267 --> 20:12.366
or our people were going to die.

20:12.368 --> 20:14.435
After months and months of searching,

20:14.437 --> 20:16.567
we finally found Earth,

20:16.569 --> 20:18.802
but your father said
we had to keep looking.

20:18.804 --> 20:20.272
There was already
intelligent life on Earth...

20:20.274 --> 20:23.108
Humans... and he did
not want to run the risk

20:23.110 --> 20:24.577
of a conflict with them.

20:24.579 --> 20:26.179
Every Atrian knows that.

20:26.181 --> 20:28.681
But what they don't know
is there was no guarantee

20:28.683 --> 20:31.382
that we would find another suitable planet.

20:31.384 --> 20:33.919
I believe that Earth was
the last chance of survival.

20:33.921 --> 20:36.156
I tried to convince the pilot

20:36.158 --> 20:38.556
to land on Earth, that we could
use our superior technology

20:38.558 --> 20:40.325
to colonize it.

20:40.327 --> 20:43.964
But the pilot wouldn't
disobey your father's orders.

20:43.966 --> 20:45.866
So you shot him.

20:45.868 --> 20:47.534
I did what I had to do

20:47.536 --> 20:49.303
to ensure the future of our people.

20:49.305 --> 20:51.339
I just didn't count on Soya fighting me,

20:51.341 --> 20:54.378
causing me to lose control of the ship.

20:55.581 --> 20:58.216
<i>You're</i> the reason the ship crashed.

20:58.218 --> 21:01.083
<i>You're</i> the reason why
thousands of Atrians died.

21:01.085 --> 21:03.020
I am the reason why we are alive.

21:03.022 --> 21:05.627
You and every other Atrian should be

21:05.629 --> 21:08.126
thanking me for what I did!

21:09.395 --> 21:12.064
You will never get the mirzan.

21:12.066 --> 21:14.734
Not until every Atrian
learns of your betrayal.

21:14.736 --> 21:18.901
You won't be Iksen, you won't be anything.

21:23.909 --> 21:26.674
We'll see about that, Roman.

21:32.111 --> 21:33.447
Hey, Sophia,

21:33.449 --> 21:35.081
have you seen Roman?

21:35.083 --> 21:36.281
He was supposed to meet me here.

21:36.283 --> 21:37.814
He said he was gonna go see the Hwatab

21:37.816 --> 21:41.755
at the House of Cards,
but that was hours ago.

21:41.757 --> 21:44.793
Sophia, I need to tell you something.

21:45.630 --> 21:47.399
Uh, Roman and I have been

21:47.401 --> 21:50.501
getting kind of close,
and we're kind of together.

21:50.503 --> 21:52.103
(Chuckles)

21:52.105 --> 21:55.107
Yeah, I kind of suspected that.

21:55.109 --> 21:56.441
Wait, you did?

21:56.443 --> 21:57.776
Don't worry, no one else knows.

21:57.778 --> 21:59.810
I saw how he was with you at Dinaskyu.

21:59.812 --> 22:01.077
I think it's great.

22:01.079 --> 22:02.345
It must be hard

22:02.347 --> 22:04.280
keeping your relationship a secret.

22:04.282 --> 22:06.048
It is.

22:06.050 --> 22:08.984
And it's almost impossible
to find chances to be alone.

22:08.986 --> 22:12.121
We were planning on watching
the meteor shower tonight,

22:12.123 --> 22:13.958
but it looks like Roman got held up,

22:13.960 --> 22:15.226
so that won't be happening.

22:15.228 --> 22:16.693
Unless...

22:17.861 --> 22:20.029
Can I ask you a favor?

22:20.031 --> 22:21.731
Yeah, anything.

22:23.868 --> 22:26.105
(Taylor sighs)

22:26.107 --> 22:30.141
So, we are waiting for
the ferry because...?

22:30.143 --> 22:32.344
It's the only way from my
parents' house to the mainland.

22:32.346 --> 22:34.647
And if I left with Zoe the
night of the charity ball,

22:34.649 --> 22:36.450
we had to have come through here.

22:36.452 --> 22:38.788
Leave it to your parents to have
a moat surrounding their house.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.191
(Chuckles)

22:40.193 --> 22:42.391
Why are you so hung up
on retracing your steps?

22:42.393 --> 22:45.227
I can't shake this feeling that
something happened that night,

22:45.229 --> 22:48.164
like I... like I lost time.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.833
And it's the last night anyone saw Zoe.

22:50.835 --> 22:53.269
Okay, you got blackout drunk... it happens.

22:53.271 --> 22:56.303
And it's not like you
were abducted by aliens.

22:56.305 --> 23:00.109
And someone did see Zoe later: Drake.

23:01.944 --> 23:03.310
And you believe him?

23:03.312 --> 23:05.312
Yeah, I do.

23:05.314 --> 23:06.948
Why? I mean, how well do you know him?

23:06.950 --> 23:08.281
I just do.

23:08.283 --> 23:11.884
Besides, what reason would he have to lie?

23:23.061 --> 23:27.695
(Indistinct radio chatter)

23:29.398 --> 23:30.897
I forgot my bag.

23:30.947 --> 23:33.167
It's on my seat in the
bus. I'll just be a sec.

23:33.217 --> 23:34.232
Hurry up.

23:47.581 --> 23:49.507
Thanks, Sophia. I owe you.

23:49.557 --> 23:51.816
- Good luck.
- Okay.

24:48.943 --> 24:50.196
True.

25:03.613 --> 25:06.178

We have got to stop wasting
our time trying to integrate

25:10.620 --> 25:11.954

25:16.592 --> 25:19.593
possibly becoming a
sovereign nation one day.

25:19.595 --> 25:22.695
Let me guess: with you as our leader.

25:22.697 --> 25:25.464

25:25.466 --> 25:27.832

Don't worry, I won't kill you.

25:34.845 --> 25:36.613
You're family.

But I will turn you over to the SEU guards

25:38.916 --> 25:41.751
with this very inventive,
very illegal weapon,

25:41.753 --> 25:44.356
which my fellow concerned Atrians will say

25:44.358 --> 25:46.359
that we found on you.

25:49.196 --> 25:51.933
I'm going to have you sent to the Crate...

Don't waste your breath.

26:10.321 --> 26:11.753
She thinks anyone who's had anything

26:11.755 --> 26:13.388
to do with the Trags is worthless.

Isn't that right, Mom?

26:14.991 --> 26:16.390
(Knocking)

26:21.298 --> 26:23.601
Roman's in trouble; I
think Castor's holding him

26:23.603 --> 26:25.471
- at the House of Cards.
- DRAKE: What happened?

26:25.473 --> 26:26.540
What is she doing here?

26:26.542 --> 26:28.242
Roman went to talk to the Hwatab

26:28.244 --> 26:30.406
about what he saw on this.

26:30.408 --> 26:33.109
If Castor found out, he
might have tried to stop him.

26:33.111 --> 26:34.978
SAROYA: This is a trap.

26:34.980 --> 26:38.381
You can't trust this Human
and you can't trust Roman.

26:38.383 --> 26:40.084
Roman's family... the only family

26:40.086 --> 26:41.851
I've had for the past eight years.

26:41.853 --> 26:43.884
And we got our problems, but I'm not gonna

26:43.886 --> 26:44.917
turn my back on him.

26:44.919 --> 26:46.250
Stay here until I get back.

26:46.252 --> 26:47.683
Wait.

26:47.685 --> 26:50.749
I'm not gonna let you face Castor alone.

26:54.585 --> 26:57.751
Keep the mirzan safe while we're gone.

27:00.690 --> 27:02.690
They need our help. Roman's in trouble.

27:02.692 --> 27:03.989
You can either be part of

27:03.991 --> 27:05.924
the backup plan, or you can stay here.

27:10.064 --> 27:13.698
I'm having this weird déjà vu.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.900
Maybe that's because we've been
up and down this road ten times.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.968
It would help if I knew
what you were looking for.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.103
Pull over here.

27:34.551 --> 27:37.050
And it was because of Drake.

27:37.052 --> 27:39.186
I want to help you, Grayson, I do,

27:39.188 --> 27:42.592

around while you talk crazy.

Honestly, it's weirding me out.

27:47.764 --> 27:49.031
What?

27:49.033 --> 27:50.566
I'm officially done.

27:50.568 --> 27:52.433
- I have a party to prep for.
- Go ahead.

27:52.435 --> 27:55.502
You may be willing to
trust Drake, but I don't.

doing in the Sector?

29:22.030 --> 29:23.360
Emery?

29:23.362 --> 29:25.763

29:28.070 --> 29:29.403

I have something you want.

29:34.042 --> 29:35.177
The mirzan.

29:35.179 --> 29:38.446
I brought it into the Sector.

29:38.448 --> 29:40.815
Let them go, and I'll get it for you.

VEGA: Looking for this?

30:12.154 --> 30:13.890
I heard you were making a big deal

30:13.892 --> 30:15.591
about this little thing.

30:15.593 --> 30:16.959
So I plugged into it.

30:16.961 --> 30:19.395
What I saw was very interesting.

30:19.397 --> 30:22.696
I imagine you don't want this
landing in the wrong hands.

30:22.698 --> 30:24.330

30:30.069 --> 30:31.900
Oh, but it does.

30:31.902 --> 30:33.335
I have business with your hostages.

30:33.337 --> 30:36.206
If you want your little toy,

30:36.208 --> 30:38.008
I'm gonna need you to release them.

30:41.949 --> 30:44.149
Let them go.

VEGA: Finally sinking in, isn't it, Saroya?

31:09.546 --> 31:12.883
You are trapped in the
Sector with a hit out on you.

31:12.885 --> 31:15.382
We'll follow Castor and his men tonight,

31:15.384 --> 31:17.050
guarantee your family's safety.

37:07.413 --> 37:09.447
I hate it so much

37:09.449 --> 37:12.381
that I went back to the levee today.

37:14.584 --> 37:18.383
And when I got there,
it all came back to me:

37:18.385 --> 37:21.318
the crash, the fight,

37:21.320 --> 37:24.220
Roman, you.

37:26.156 --> 37:28.960
And then I remembered Zoe...

37:28.962 --> 37:31.429
on the ground...

37:31.431 --> 37:35.502
with your hands around her neck.

37:38.474 --> 37:40.340
What do you want?

37:45.079 --> 37:46.813
I'll let you know.

37:51.052 --> 37:53.489
EMERY: It's beautiful here.

37:53.491 --> 37:55.791
I've been coming here since I was a kid

37:55.793 --> 37:57.492
when I wanted to get away.

37:57.494 --> 37:59.359
I'd just stare at the sky

37:59.361 --> 38:00.962
and pretend I was somewhere else.

38:00.964 --> 38:04.303
But eventually, I had
to get back to reality.

38:04.305 --> 38:06.369
What are you gonna do about Castor?

38:06.371 --> 38:08.770
He has the flight recorder.

38:08.772 --> 38:10.572
Doesn't matter.

38:10.574 --> 38:13.442
I'll go to the Hwatab tomorrow
and tell them Saroya's story.

38:13.444 --> 38:15.311
They've supported me before.

38:15.313 --> 38:16.946
Hopefully, they'll believe me now.

38:16.948 --> 38:19.181
Once every Atrian finds
out truth about Castor,

38:19.183 --> 38:22.050
they'll never accept him as their leader.

38:23.954 --> 38:26.558
I hope you're right.

38:26.560 --> 38:29.795
You were right about Castor.

38:29.797 --> 38:31.527
I should've listened to you.

38:36.097 --> 38:39.533
I will never get used
to putting you in danger,

38:39.535 --> 38:42.569
but I realize that you're part of my world.

38:42.571 --> 38:44.271
And in our world,

38:44.273 --> 38:46.707
we're better together than apart.

39:09.271 --> 39:12.573
CASTOR: My fellow Atrians,

39:12.575 --> 39:18.016
I have learned that Roman,
son of our late Iksen, Nox,

39:18.018 --> 39:20.086
has taken up with a Human girl.

39:20.088 --> 39:22.322
If Roman has kept this from you,

39:22.324 --> 39:24.992
what else could he be lying about?

39:24.994 --> 39:26.426
You deserve to know if your future Iksen

39:26.428 --> 39:29.129
is truly dedicated to his people,

39:29.131 --> 39:32.567
or if being part of the Human
world has caused his interests

39:32.569 --> 39:33.969
to lie elsewhere.

39:33.971 --> 39:37.307
(Clamoring, sirens wailing in distance)

39:48.890 --> 39:52.632
In Drake's pod, you could've
taken Castor and his men out.

39:52.634 --> 39:53.834
Why didn't you?

39:53.836 --> 39:54.902
Patience, child.

39:54.904 --> 39:58.104
We need Castor alive, for now.

39:59.943 --> 40:02.646
Saroya.

40:02.648 --> 40:04.481
What brings you here at this hour?

40:04.483 --> 40:06.116
I couldn't sleep.

40:06.118 --> 40:07.652
And as much as it

40:07.654 --> 40:09.989
kills me to admit it, you're right.

40:11.125 --> 40:12.495
There's no escaping Castor

40:12.497 --> 40:14.462
and his men in the Sector.

40:16.263 --> 40:18.332
I'll build your Suvek...

40:19.768 --> 40:22.868
if you promise to protect me and my son.

40:23.769 --> 40:26.104
You have my word.

40:31.341 --> 40:33.978
This Suvek... what is it?

40:37.846 --> 40:41.218
The last weapon we'll ever
need against the Humans.

40:49.942 --> 40:54.942
