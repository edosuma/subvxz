It was the nicest little whorehouse
you ever saw.

00:51.586 --> 00:56.023
<i>It lay about a mile outside the city limits,
so everybody could feel real friendly.</i>

00:56.147 --> 01:00.504
<i>Sheriff Jack Roy Wallace picked it out
for Miss Wulla Jean in 1910,...</i>

01:00.627 --> 01:05.576
<i>...and she moved there with her girls from
over the hardware store on main street.</i>

01:06.787 --> 01:09.540
<i>} 0h, the little house lay</i>

01:09.667 --> 01:12.420
<i>} In a green Texas glade</i>

01:12.547 --> 01:15.698
<i>} Where the trees were as coolin'</i>

01:15.827 --> 01:18.387
<i>} As fresh lemonade</i>

01:19.227 --> 01:23.982
<i>} Soft summer wind
had a trace of perfume</i>

01:24.347 --> 01:29.057
<i>} And a fan was turnin' in every room</i>

01:29.868 --> 01:32.621
<i>} Twenty fans were turnin',
they were turnin'</i>

01:32.748 --> 01:35.137
<i>} Twenty fans were turnin' in every room</i>

01:35.548 --> 01:38.187
<i>} Fevers were a-burnin',
they were burnin'</i>

01:38.828 --> 01:41.706
<i>} And they had to have
a way to cool down</i>

01:49.588 --> 01:52.785
<i>Right from the beginning,
the little house was special,...</i>

01:52.908 --> 01:55.138
<i>...like a home away from home.</i>

01:55.269 --> 01:59.308
<i>Miss Wulla Jean put a Pianola
in the parlour to sorta help break the ice.</i>

01:59.429 --> 02:04.264
<i>A fella could ask a girl to dance
or, if he held back a little, she'd ask him.</i>

02:04.389 --> 02:07.222
<i>And pretty soon they'd get
a little business goin'.</i>

02:07.349 --> 02:09.226
<i>Two dollars' worth.</i>

02:09.348 --> 02:11.340
Yahoo!

02:11.469 --> 02:16.543
<i>It wasn't long before it became one of the
better-known pleasure palaces in Texas.</i>

02:16.669 --> 02:20.218
<i>So much so that the fellas
who visited during World War I...</i>

02:20.349 --> 02:22.817
<i>...sent their sons back in World War I I.</i>

02:23.510 --> 02:26.422
<i>The hospitality and friendliness
never changed,...</i>

02:26.550 --> 02:29.428
<i>...and neither did Miss Wulla Jean's
strict set of rules.</i>

02:29.550 --> 02:31.825
<i>She liked her ladies, as she called 'em,...</i>

02:31.950 --> 02:36.705
<i>...to treat her customers real good,
but never in an unladylike way.</i>

02:39.070 --> 02:43.222
<i>And she insisted that each girl
check her gentleman for the clap...</i>

02:43.350 --> 02:46.262
<i>...and wash him off
with soap and warm water.</i>

02:46.390 --> 02:49.587
<i>Some of the fellas claimed that
that was the best part!</i>

02:49.790 --> 02:51.940
Oo-ee!

02:54.911 --> 02:59.826
<i>It was only durin' the Hoover Depression
that the little house had tough times.</i>

02:59.951 --> 03:02.909
<i>Miss Wulla Jean put in a jukebox
to spark up business.</i>

03:03.591 --> 03:07.266
<i>But it wasn't always easy in them days
to come up with hard cash.</i>

03:07.391 --> 03:09.347
<i>(clucking)</i>

03:09.471 --> 03:12.190
Well, you just keep that in the bag...

03:12.311 --> 03:15.348
...and I'll take it out back
as soon as we're finished.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.945
<i>So for a while, as the story goes,...</i>

03:21.071 --> 03:24.108
<i>...the girls began acceptin'
poultry in trade.</i>

03:24.232 --> 03:26.109
<i>0ne bird, one lay.</i>

03:26.432 --> 03:28.946
<i>And that's how the place got its name.</i>

03:29.072 --> 03:31.222
<i>The Chicken Ranch.</i>

03:34.672 --> 03:36.902
<i>Course, if you grew up
anywhere in Texas,...</i>

03:37.032 --> 03:40.581
<i>...you knew at an early age
they was sellin' somethin' out there,...</i>

03:40.712 --> 03:43.067
<i>...and it wasn't poultry.</i>

04:03.913 --> 04:05.949

went peacefully about its business...</i>

<i>...while the people in Gilbert
went about theirs.</i>

06:07.757 --> 06:10.829
<i>That is, until about seven years ago.</i>

06:12.757 --> 06:16.432
<i>I was a deputy back then,
workin' for Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd.</i>

06:17.117 --> 06:19.790
You wanted me to remind you
about your appointment.

06:19.918 --> 06:23.433
<i>That was right after I had lost
the fried chicken franchise,...</i>

06:23.558 --> 06:28.427
<i>...while Ed Earl had been sheriff
ever since old Jack Roy Wallace retired.</i>

06:28.558 --> 06:31.914
<i>Everybody liked Ed Earl,
especially Ed Earl.</i>

06:34.398 --> 06:38.550
<i>Course, he sure did know his job,
and he was a big influence on me.</i>

06:38.678 --> 06:41.033
<i>Taught me everything I know.</i>

06:41.958 --> 06:44.153
<i>He used to like to run a quiet town...</i>

06:44.278 --> 06:48.988
<i>...with plenty of time off for socialisin'
and coffee over at Dulcie Mae's Café.</i>

06:49.119 --> 06:53.271
<i>0h, now and again there'd be a problem,
and we had some tough ones.</i>

06:53.399 --> 06:55.754
<i>Like the time the mule
sat on Miss Modene's car.</i>

06:55.879 --> 06:58.791
<i>(Miss Modene) He just buckled up his legs
and sat down.</i>

06:58.919 --> 07:02.878
<i>She was really havin' a hissy fit,
but it didn't faze Ed Earl.</i>

07:02.999 --> 07:06.469
<i>He just walked over to that jackass
and laid down the law.</i>

07:07.319 --> 07:10.550
<i>You see, Ed Earl always
believed in talkin' first.</i>

07:10.679 --> 07:14.831
<i>Cool reasonin', he used to tell me,
could solve any problem.</i>

07:14.959 --> 07:17.314
<i>Course, he did have a bit of a temper.</i>

07:22.880 --> 07:27.829
<i>Anyway, just about the time he became
sheriff, Miss Wulla Jean passed on.</i>

07:27.960 --> 07:32.272
<i>She left the Chicken Ranch to her
favourite workin' girl, Mona Stangely,...</i>

07:32.400 --> 07:35.312
<i>...who saw the little house
as a Texas institution...</i>

07:35.440 --> 07:37.635

13:44.773 --> 13:46.252
Bye.

13:56.173 --> 13:58.767
- Hey, Miss Mona.
- How are you doin', Deputy Fred?

13:58.893 --> 14:02.602
- It's nice to see you.
- Keepin' an eye on my place at night?

14:02.733 --> 14:05.372
The sheriff's real particular
about security there.

14:05.493 --> 14:07.802
Well, one of these nights,
you drop in.

14:07.933 --> 14:11.164
My girls would love to show you
a little appreciation.

14:11.294 --> 14:13.762
Shoot, Miss Mona!
You know I'm a married man.

14:13.894 --> 14:16.806
Fred, you think the cows
don't appreciate the time off...

14:16.934 --> 14:19.653
...when a bull goes over
to another pasture?

14:19.774 --> 14:21.730
Miss Mona!

14:22.414 --> 14:25.804
- See you later, Miss Mona.
- OK. Goodbye.

15:10.976 --> 15:13.444
- Damn it!
- What's the matter?

15:13.576 --> 15:15.612
- You're in bed already.
- So?

15:15.736 --> 15:19.775
So I told you a hundred times - watching
you get undressed is the best part.

15:19.896 --> 15:21.693
<i>The best part?</i>

15:21.816 --> 15:25.047
Well, maybe not the best part,
but in the top two.

15:26.576 --> 15:29.886
Now, would I wanna disappoint
my little honey?

15:31.776 --> 15:33.528
Whoo!

15:34.096 --> 15:36.246
- I'm glad I was late.
- Me too!

15:36.377 --> 15:39.369
You just hold your horses.
I got a surprise for you.

15:39.497 --> 15:44.093
I went by the post office. I picked up
a package from Frederick's of Hollywood.

15:44.217 --> 15:46.777
Just a little something sexy
I thought you'd like.

15:46.897 --> 15:49.252
Little? It don't look little to me.

15:49.377 --> 15:52.369
Well, it ain't a trainin' bra,
but I believe I can fill it out.

15:52.497 --> 15:56.251
- I don't think you got any problem there.
- I'll be back with more.

15:56.377 --> 16:01.292
<i>(chuckles) You know, Mona,
I've known a lot of women in my life.</i>

16:01.417 --> 16:04.056
None of 'em have ever been
exciting to me like you are.

16:04.177 --> 16:07.772
Really? Even after all these years
we've been meetin' like this?

16:07.898 --> 16:10.253
I'll tell you something.

16:12.338 --> 16:16.297
A year with you is like...
a minute of sheer happiness.

16:17.018 --> 16:21.409
Well, now, that is just about the sweetest
thing anybody ever said to me.

16:21.538 --> 16:23.768
I know.

16:23.898 --> 16:25.889
You know, honey...

16:26.018 --> 16:28.896
...you bring out the... romantic in me.

16:35.259 --> 16:36.533
Ta-da!

16:38.059 --> 16:40.175
Whoo! You did that real fast.

16:40.299 --> 16:43.132
I've had a lot of practice
gettin' in and out of my clothes.

16:43.259 --> 16:45.409
How do you like the outfit?

16:46.259 --> 16:49.774
Hot damn. Makes me feel real sexy!

16:51.059 --> 16:53.015
Whoo!

16:56.979 --> 16:59.049
Well, you don't look real sexy.

16:59.179 --> 17:01.329
- I look like I always look.
- That's just it.

17:01.459 --> 17:05.008
It's them damn droopy boxer drawers.
I just hate the looks of them.

17:05.140 --> 17:08.337
- I've worn boxer shorts for years!
- And they look like it.

17:08.460 --> 17:12.499
These are a brand-new pair.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

17:12.619 --> 17:15.771
People tell me I have
a real sexy quality about me.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.130
Well, you do,
but them boxer shorts don't.

17:18.260 --> 17:21.730
But when I was gettin' me some
sexy things, I thought about you.

17:21.859 --> 17:23.896
They have a his-and-hers department...

17:24.020 --> 17:26.932
...and I thought you might
wanna try that on for size.

17:27.900 --> 17:30.653
What the hell is it? A Japanese slingshot?

17:30.780 --> 17:34.659
No, it's Jockey shorts
with little silver snaps on the side.

17:34.781 --> 17:38.410
Mm. "Little" is the key word here.
They are real little.

17:38.541 --> 17:42.454
A guy could hurt himself wearin' those.
I don't think so, thank you very much.

17:42.581 --> 17:46.972
Ed Earl, I paid $20 for these, plus
postage, and I want you to wear 'em.

17:47.661 --> 17:50.016
- You paid $20 for these?
- Yes!

17:50.141 --> 17:52.530
Well, you got screwed.

17:52.901 --> 17:56.018
- Come on, Ed Earl!
- No!

17:56.141 --> 18:00.498
If they look half as good as I think,
you ain't gonna wear 'em but a second.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.577
Maybe less.

18:03.262 --> 18:05.571
- They're ridiculous.
- They're sexy.

18:05.702 --> 18:07.374
No, no, no!

18:07.502 --> 18:10.141
Well, fine! I'm gettin' dressed
and goin' home.

18:10.262 --> 18:14.016
Well, fine! I'm goin' in the bathroom
and... put these on.

18:18.382 --> 18:21.374
Be like puttin' two bowlin' balls
in a marble bag.

18:21.942 --> 18:24.137
Braggin', braggin', braggin'.

18:27.622 --> 18:31.535
- Well, I saw Dulcie Mae in town today.
- Oh, yeah?

18:31.662 --> 18:34.620
I guess you'll be goin' there
for Thanksgivin' dinner.

18:34.743 --> 18:38.418
- Don't I always?
- You better check that turkey of hers...

18:38.543 --> 18:42.661
...because there's a hook in there that's
gonna drag your ass to a weddin' chapel.

18:42.783 --> 18:44.933
<i>(chuckles) No way.</i>

18:48.103 --> 18:51.493
I don't believe in matrimony.
It screws up a relationship.

18:51.623 --> 18:53.853
Amen to that, Ed Earl.

18:54.943 --> 18:58.140
- Ready?
- Oh, I'm always ready.

19:03.344 --> 19:06.097
Well, hellfire! Is that it?

19:06.224 --> 19:10.137
- How'd you like it?
- I didn't hardly get to even see them!

19:10.264 --> 19:13.142
That's all you're gonna see,
cos I ain't parading around.

19:13.264 --> 19:14.982
- Oh, come on, Ed Earl.
- No!

19:15.104 --> 19:17.413
- For me.
- No.

19:17.544 --> 19:20.183
- One itsy-bitsy peek?
- What are you doin'?

19:22.384 --> 19:25.342
Now, that's what
the little silver snaps are for.

19:26.784 --> 19:29.821
- Work, don't they?
- Just like a snap.

19:30.784 --> 19:33.776
Come on over here
and give me a little lip-lock.

19:35.345 --> 19:37.301
Oop. Gotta brush my teeth.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.700
You know how I am about my breath.

19:45.945 --> 19:50.302
Oh, Ed Earl, I like a lot of things, but
these afternoons with you top the list.

19:50.625 --> 19:52.934
Yeah? Well, sing it to me, honey.

19:55.105 --> 19:57.061
} I like fancy, frilly things

19:57.465 --> 19:59.615
} High-heeled shoes and diamond rings

19:59.745 --> 20:01.815
} Ragtime bands and Western swing

20:01.946 --> 20:03.902
} And sneakin' around with you

20:04.586 --> 20:06.577
} Well, I like beer and rodeos

20:06.706 --> 20:08.822
} Detective books and dominoes

20:08.946 --> 20:12.780
} Football games and Cheerios
and sneakin' around with you

20:13.066 --> 20:15.341
} Sneakin' around with you

20:15.466 --> 20:17.696
} Goin' a round or two

20:17.826 --> 20:19.976
} Doin' what lovers do

20:20.586 --> 20:22.895
} Whenever they're sneakin' around

20:23.026 --> 20:24.982
} I like lots of cash on hand

20:25.106 --> 20:27.495
} And dirty jokes
about the Fuller Brush Man

20:27.626 --> 20:31.096
} I like stuff I understand
like sneakin' around with you

20:31.787 --> 20:34.096
} You know, I like a thrill
that has no strings

20:34.227 --> 20:36.138
} Friendship that don't ever change

20:36.267 --> 20:38.383
} And laughter from the joy of things

20:38.507 --> 20:40.304
} And sneakin' around with you

20:40.427 --> 20:42.543
} Sneakin' around with you

20:42.667 --> 20:44.862
} Goin' a round or two

20:44.987 --> 20:47.137
} Doin' what lovers do

20:47.787 --> 20:49.982
} Whenever they're sneakin' around

21:00.548 --> 21:02.778
} I like drive-in picture shows

21:02.908 --> 21:05.024
} Kissin' long and lovin' slow

21:05.148 --> 21:08.823
} The secret places lovers go
whenever they're sneakin' around

21:08.948 --> 21:11.621
Whoo!
} I like the crazy things we try

21:11.748 --> 21:13.898
} And the sexy things we fantasise

21:14.028 --> 21:16.098
} Just a-makin' out
in the broad daylight

21:16.228 --> 21:17.866
} And sneakin' around with you

21:17.988 --> 21:20.263
} Sneakin' around with you

21:20.388 --> 21:22.618
} Keepin' it all brand-new

21:22.748 --> 21:24.818
} Gettin' the best of you

21:25.428 --> 21:27.180
} Whenever we're sneakin' around

21:27.308 --> 21:29.424
} Sneakin' around, that's all

21:29.549 --> 21:31.585
} I'm gonna lay down the law

21:31.909 --> 21:34.059
} Watchin' the rise and fall

21:34.429 --> 21:36.385
} Of lovers sneakin' around

21:37.189 --> 21:40.465
- } We're just sneakin' around
- } Oh, we're just

21:40.589 --> 21:42.545
} Sneakin'!

21:46.389 --> 21:47.902
Sheriff?

21:48.349 --> 21:50.305
Sheriff!

21:52.669 --> 21:54.944
<i>- Deputy Fred.
- (Mona) Fred.</i>

21:58.710 --> 22:00.382
Oh...

22:00.510 --> 22:02.466
Hold that position.

22:03.430 --> 22:06.228
Don't move. Be right back.

22:17.110 --> 22:19.670
- This better be important.
- Well, I think it is.

22:19.790 --> 22:22.623
I saw your car and I figured
your phone was out, because...

22:22.750 --> 22:24.706
What are you wearin' that for?

22:24.830 --> 22:26.821
- Takin' a shower.
- Oh, really?

22:26.950 --> 22:30.147
<i>I take my shower in the mornin'.
I read in the Reader's Digest...</i>

22:30.271 --> 22:33.581
I don't care! What do you want?

22:33.711 --> 22:37.624
The mayor wants to speak to you. Rita's
been callin' all over the county for you.

22:37.751 --> 22:40.311
- He wants a meeting right away.
- Can't it wait?

22:40.431 --> 22:43.104
- You mean till after your shower?
- Mm...

22:43.231 --> 22:46.507
You go to your radio.
Tell him I'll be there when I get there.

22:46.631 --> 22:49.384
Nothing can be that important
that it can't wait.

22:49.511 --> 22:51.308
Right, Sheriff.

22:51.431 --> 22:53.581
Nice man, but dumb.

22:59.992 --> 23:03.109
<i>Mona? (laughs)</i>

23:03.952 --> 23:05.908
Mona?

23:12.632 --> 23:14.588
<i>(car starts)</i>

23:40.713 --> 23:44.228
Ain't that funny? Miss Mona was
at the back, knockin' on the screen door.

23:44.353 --> 23:47.663
She was in a hurry,
but just dropped by to give you this.

23:51.153 --> 23:53.542
It's a Japanese slingshot.

23:56.034 --> 23:58.468
Well, look at that! At last!

23:58.594 --> 24:00.585
OK, Rufus. What's on your mind?

24:00.714 --> 24:05.151
Something with serious implications
to the health of this town! Tell him, CJ!

24:05.274 --> 24:08.550
I have this friend that works
in a TV station down in Houston.

24:08.674 --> 24:13.668
He tipped me off that Melvin P Thorpe's
plannin' an exposé on the Chicken Ranch.

24:13.794 --> 24:15.944
- Who?
- Melvin P Thorpe.

24:16.074 --> 24:19.908
He's that crazy consumer advocate.
Has a report on the late night news.

24:20.034 --> 24:24.710
<i>He's got a new show once a week:
The Watchdog Report. It's on tonight.</i>

24:24.834 --> 24:28.031
The Chicken Ranch on TV.
Now, come on, fellas.

24:29.275 --> 24:32.233
- Television is a family medium.
- But he's a sensationalist.

24:32.355 --> 24:37.065
He shows up every time a consumer has
a complaint. He's a menace to business.

24:37.515 --> 24:41.747
He's that fella that put the peanuts
back in the chocolate bar.

24:41.875 --> 24:42.625
What?

24:42.755 --> 24:45.667
He made the makers of
the Peanut Delight candy bar admit...

24:45.795 --> 24:50.505
...that they put less peanuts in than
they said. He made 'em change their ways.

24:50.635 --> 24:53.593
- Sounds like a tough customer.
- He has a lot of influence.

24:53.715 --> 24:55.910
If he brings cameras
to the Chicken Ranch...

24:56.036 --> 24:59.153
Come on, Rufus!
I'll make some phone calls.

25:00.316 --> 25:03.388
I got a little influence
around this state myself.

25:06.236 --> 25:08.909
Well, it's no use talkin' to me
about it, Sheriff.

25:09.036 --> 25:12.346
Melvin P Thorpe is now the biggest
attraction at this station.

25:12.476 --> 25:16.435
High ratings. Lots of letters.
He doesn't listen to anybody.

25:17.036 --> 25:21.154
Hell, he wants to go national! Wants
to be watchdog for the whole US of A.

25:21.396 --> 25:25.150
Love to help, but just like you don't
wanna mess with the Chicken Ranch...

25:25.277 --> 25:27.666
...I don't wanna ruffle
this old bird's feathers.

25:27.797 --> 25:30.869
Here in Houston, he's becomin'
a regular Texas attraction.

25:31.037 --> 25:32.914
Now, wait a minute, Ed Earl.

25:33.037 --> 25:36.791
I'd tread easy on this one.
Them TV boys can be mighty powerful.

25:36.917 --> 25:39.351
And mighty useful, if you get my meaning.

25:39.477 --> 25:41.433
Senator, roll call.

25:41.557 --> 25:45.345
Excuse me, Ed Earl. I gotta go.
It's that damn bilingual bullshit again.

25:45.477 --> 25:49.948
Let me give you a word of advice
from one elected official to another.

25:50.077 --> 25:52.432
Be careful of the box.

25:55.838 --> 26:00.548
What the hell's goin' on? This goddamn
Thorpe's got the whole state bamboozled.

26:00.678 --> 26:03.272
This is serious, Ed Earl.
You gotta do somethin'.

26:03.398 --> 26:05.548
I intend to.

26:05.678 --> 26:08.750
Deputy Fred, I want you to
hold down the fort for a while.

26:08.878 --> 26:10.106
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

26:10.238 --> 26:12.149
- Where you goin'?
- To Houston.

26:12.278 --> 26:15.588
I'm gonna take care of that
little peckerwood myself.

26:34.319 --> 26:36.275
- This is it.
- Thank you.

26:38.159 --> 26:39.797
Come in.

26:43.119 --> 26:45.587
- Mr Thorpe?
- I know you.

26:46.479 --> 26:48.470
- You do?
- Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd.

26:48.599 --> 26:50.954
They told me you were here. Come on in.

26:52.280 --> 26:55.795
I hope I'm not... interruptin' anything.

26:55.920 --> 26:59.629
Oh, please! It's my pleasure, my honour.
What brings you to Houston?

26:59.760 --> 27:02.513
Sit down. Anywhere over here.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.551
I'm gettin' dressed. Sit down.

27:04.680 --> 27:08.389
I've got my TV show to do,
and I'm runnin' a bit behind time.

27:08.520 --> 27:11.273
It's your show I want to talk to you about,
Mr Thorpe.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.038
- Melvin.
- Melvin.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.390
- Please. You watch the show, Ed?
- Well...

27:15.520 --> 27:18.830
Last week was the best ratin' we ever had.

27:18.960 --> 27:22.430
The city planning commissioner
was drivin' a city car...

27:22.561 --> 27:24.711
Hold that for me, will you?

27:24.841 --> 27:27.833
...while he was on vacation.
Caught him dead to rights.

27:27.961 --> 27:30.395
That pitiful putz.
Would you just pull that up?

27:30.521 --> 27:32.477
Just pull that up.

27:33.601 --> 27:37.640
And we broke a 30 share. It's affectin'
my pieces on the late night news.

27:37.761 --> 27:40.992
Up, up, up.
They just love my little report.

27:42.881 --> 27:46.271
- I hear you're very popular.
- The power of television...

27:46.401 --> 27:49.757
...of public exposure,
is so great it scares me.

27:49.881 --> 27:54.272
I swear, I could get the mayor's
own children to throw rocks at him.

27:54.402 --> 27:56.870
Which show did you like best, Ed?

27:57.722 --> 28:01.192
I think the one about
the... nuts in the chocolate bar.

28:01.322 --> 28:03.278
That's one of my favourites.

28:03.402 --> 28:06.360
Threescore means 60, like the Bible says.

28:06.482 --> 28:09.201
So if it says "60 nuts" on the wrapper...

28:09.322 --> 28:12.394
...I wanna see 60 nuts inside.

28:12.522 --> 28:15.320
And I'm talkin' full nuts.
I'm not talkin' a half-nut...

28:15.442 --> 28:17.797
...or nut bits or nut chips.

28:19.242 --> 28:21.597
I'm talkin' a full nut.

28:25.003 --> 28:26.482
I can see that.

28:26.603 --> 28:29.071
Thank God we still live in a society...

28:29.203 --> 28:33.799
...where anything that's phoney or
dishonest can't stand the light of day.

28:34.643 --> 28:36.952
- Sock.
- Beg your pardon?

28:37.083 --> 28:39.119
Sock. Thank you.

28:39.243 --> 28:40.722
Yeah...

28:41.083 --> 28:44.792
Most corporations
involved in false advertisin'...

28:44.923 --> 28:46.914
...would just laugh at a $50 fine.

28:47.043 --> 28:52.071
But you show up with your TV camera
and give them a little bad publicity...

28:52.204 --> 28:56.243
...and they shape up faster than
goose shit slides through a tin horn.

28:56.364 --> 28:58.275
<i>(laughs)</i>

28:58.564 --> 29:00.714
<i>(hums)</i>

29:00.844 --> 29:05.235
Melvin, it's that bad publicity I want to
talk to you about. That could hurt people.

29:05.364 --> 29:08.322
You take that report you're doin'
on the Chicken Ranch.

29:08.444 --> 29:10.639
That place is older than rocks and water.

29:10.764 --> 29:13.358
I expect your granddaddy
took your daddy there...

29:13.484 --> 29:17.113
<i>...to learn about the birds and the bees.
- (chuckles)</i>

29:17.244 --> 29:21.442
I'm from New Jersey. See, I moved
to Houston six years ago.

29:21.565 --> 29:22.520
<i>(chuckles)</i>

29:22.645 --> 29:24.795
Texas suits my style.

29:25.845 --> 29:32.239
Every schoolboy in the state knows about
it. Most of the politicians have slept there.

29:32.365 --> 29:36.153
The mayor and the people of my county
want to keep things just the way they are.

29:36.285 --> 29:40.164
Hm. You know somethin', Sheriff.
It just struck me.

29:40.285 --> 29:43.197
- We are in the same profession.
- What's that?

29:43.325 --> 29:47.716
Law enforcement. I'm out there fightin'
for the rights of the public, just like you.

29:47.845 --> 29:50.200
Both of us are trying to protect the public.

29:50.326 --> 29:53.523
You in the old way and me in the new.

29:54.486 --> 29:56.716
<i>- The new?
- (chuckles) Television.</i>

29:57.606 --> 29:59.676
I'm the electronic bounty hunter.

29:59.806 --> 30:01.762
I use a camera. You use a gun.

30:02.406 --> 30:06.763
Yeah. Melvin, everybody'd be happy
if you'd just drop the whole thing.

30:07.566 --> 30:12.356
I mean, those ladies out there,
they perform a necessary function.

30:12.486 --> 30:15.398
- Right or wrong...
- Right or wrong don't interest me!

30:15.526 --> 30:18.598
I'm no moraliser.
I leave all that to the preacher.

30:19.567 --> 30:24.243
I'm glad. The mayor was thinkin' maybe
you'd want a little unnecessary publicity.

30:24.367 --> 30:28.201
<i>(laughs) Unnecessary publicity?
Well, he's got me all wrong!</i>

30:28.327 --> 30:31.763
I'm not one of those sensation-mongers
out to boost his own ego!

30:31.887 --> 30:33.320
Clear.

30:34.047 --> 30:36.766
- How do you like it?
- It's different.

30:36.887 --> 30:38.843
I designed this myself.

30:39.367 --> 30:43.565
No, you tell your mayor he's got
nothing to fear from me on that score.

30:44.647 --> 30:48.765
- He'll be happy to hear that.
- I'm a lawman. That's my interest. Right?

30:48.888 --> 30:49.843
<i>(knocking)</i>

30:49.968 --> 30:52.163
- 20 seconds.
- Oh, I'm on!

30:52.288 --> 30:54.438
Friend Ed, I gotta go.

30:55.448 --> 30:58.042
That's my cue. Come on!

31:00.248 --> 31:02.284
<i>Après vous!</i>

31:02.408 --> 31:05.844
<i>- I'd love to do an interview with you.
- I don't think I'm the type.</i>

31:05.968 --> 31:08.562
Nonsense! You're what
the public wants to see.

31:08.688 --> 31:11.998
We'll discuss it after the show.
I want you to be my guest.

31:12.128 --> 31:15.484
This is the sponsor's booth.
Just make yourself comfortable.

31:15.608 --> 31:18.486
Make yourself to home.
See you later, partner.

...that has been allowed to exist
for close to a hundred years.

32:12.370 --> 32:15.567
I'm talkin' about
the Chicken Ranch, my friends.

32:15.691 --> 32:21.448
The proprietor of this innocent-lookin'
ranch house is known only as Miss Mona.

32:21.571 --> 32:26.281
And the man who turns his back
on her illegal operation...

32:26.411 --> 32:29.164
...is Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd!

32:29.611 --> 32:32.284
Did I say "illegal"? Yes, I did!

32:33.251 --> 32:35.970
Now, I know that this is TV...

32:36.091 --> 32:39.288
...so I'm gonna try to be
as delicate as I can!

Not that it's big news to anybody
over three months of age.

But they heard it in their livin' room.
Sung. Sung to music.

35:13.857 --> 35:16.530
And he actually called
my name on television?

35:16.657 --> 35:19.967
Worse than that.

Because I trust you.

Yeah. All rolled up

That's typical of them crusadin' fanatics.

pretty soon it just clears out of the air.

- Well, ain't I always?

Mm-hm.

Just how much I miss the little stuff
we used to do, like goin' up to the lake.

36:11.779 --> 36:16.091
Wouldn't it be fun to go up there, get
a couple of six-packs, and just get drunk?

36:16.219 --> 36:19.973

- Oh, yeah?

40:23.547 --> 40:28.302
We're within the law. As a newsman,
I have First Amendment protection.

40:28.947 --> 40:33.623
Get this. The public has a right to know
what is goin' on out there...

40:33.747 --> 40:36.022
<i>...and what kind of payoff
you're acceptin'...</i>

40:36.148 --> 40:38.946
...to protect that notorious
house of ill repute.

40:39.068 --> 40:41.059
<i>(crowd gasps)</i>

40:52.628 --> 40:56.780
First thing is, you're
standin' in Lanville County...

40:56.908 --> 41:01.698
...which, by my figurin', is about 100 miles
west of that stink hole you call Houston.

41:01.828 --> 41:05.264
<i>So I can't see it's any of your business
what goes on out here.</i>

41:05.389 --> 41:07.061
Oh, yeah?

41:07.189 --> 41:08.702
Please...

41:08.829 --> 41:09.978
Number two.

41:10.109 --> 41:12.907
You ain't the law around here and I am.

41:13.029 --> 41:15.623
So don't be tellin' me
what my goddamn job is...

41:15.749 --> 41:19.378
...or I'll whip your butt so bad
it'll look like the stripes on a barber pole.

41:19.509 --> 41:22.069
<i>- (boy) Get him, Sheriff.
- May be mean, but he's ours!</i>

41:22.189 --> 41:23.304
Number three.

41:23.429 --> 41:27.945
No sawed-off little pecker is gonna
accuse me of takin' a bribe and live...

41:28.069 --> 41:30.378
...cos I wear the badge
in this goddamn county.

41:30.509 --> 41:34.104
So you listen and listen good,
you over-padded, televising turd!

41:34.230 --> 41:38.382
If I ever see you or any of those bastards
that work for you in my town again...

41:38.510 --> 41:42.947
...I'm gonna knock you so flat
you'll have to roll down your socks to shit!

41:43.830 --> 41:46.469
- That's tellin' him, Sheriff!
- My goodness!

41:46.590 --> 41:50.902
So get outta here, you goddamn
wig-wearin', citified son of a bitch!

42:06.271 --> 42:08.227
Move, you schmuck!

42:10.151 --> 42:12.142
Move it! Come on!

42:12.271 --> 42:14.307
Get outta here!

42:14.431 --> 42:17.707
Move this thing!
Come on, move this thing!

42:17.831 --> 42:22.143
I'll get you for this. You son of a bitch!
You'll pay for this.

42:22.271 --> 42:25.422
You're in trouble, Sheriff!
You're in big trouble!

42:26.871 --> 42:28.463
So long, partner.

42:30.591 --> 42:32.547
<i>(applause)</i>

42:54.112 --> 42:57.502
Boy, you sent him hightailin'.
I was so proud of you!

42:57.632 --> 42:59.588
- Didn't I?
- Yeah.

43:04.113 --> 43:06.468
- Look at them stars.
- Mm.

43:07.513 --> 43:10.266
There ain't nothin'
prettier than a Texas sky.

43:10.393 --> 43:12.463
Ain't that the truth.

43:14.593 --> 43:17.824
- Hey! Did you see that shootin' star?
- Mm-hm.

43:17.953 --> 43:20.228
- That could've been a spaceship.
- Yeah.

43:20.353 --> 43:22.913
- You believe in spaceships?
- Sure.

43:23.033 --> 43:28.471
I saw a picture once. Them fellas
that's supposed to be from up there.

43:29.073 --> 43:34.067
Tiny little fellas, bald-headed.
Little feet, little hands, got no peckers.

43:34.794 --> 43:36.944
Got no peckers?

43:37.634 --> 43:39.989
Well, I ain't interested.

43:41.194 --> 43:43.549
I don't think my girls would be either.

43:44.714 --> 43:47.592
When I was little,
I used to imagine a flyin' saucer...

43:47.714 --> 43:51.423
...swoopin' down and pickin' me up
and takin' me off to heaven.

43:51.554 --> 43:53.749
- Like the angels.
- Mm-hm.

43:54.634 --> 43:57.626
"I looked, and behold, a whirlwind
comin' out of the north."

43:57.754 --> 44:02.032
"And out of the midst of the fire came
the likeness of four living creatures."

44:02.155 --> 44:03.554
What you talkin' about?

44:03.675 --> 44:06.951
That's what the Bible says
about spaceships in Ezekiel.

44:07.075 --> 44:09.464
- Don't you know nothin' about the Bible?
- Yeah!

44:09.595 --> 44:12.428
I just don't know nothin'
about no Zekiel in the Bible.

44:12.555 --> 44:15.945
I knew a Zekiel Peebles
once in the eighth grade.

44:17.195 --> 44:19.151
Think I busted his jaw.

44:20.275 --> 44:25.429
- Well, that was very christian of you.
- Well, most of my family was Baptist.

44:25.555 --> 44:29.514
I never stayed with one family long
enough to become anything in particular.

44:29.636 --> 44:32.230
But I read the Bible.
I believe in Jesus.

44:32.836 --> 44:35.908
I think Jesus was a...
was a real good man.

44:36.716 --> 44:38.866
And he was a heck of a speaker.

44:38.996 --> 44:42.625
Yep. I knew a woman once
that had a vision of Jesus.

44:42.756 --> 44:46.146
He came right into her house,
set right down at the foot of her bed.

44:46.276 --> 44:47.550
Mm?

44:47.676 --> 44:49.906
I don't know what I'd do
if that happened to me.

44:50.036 --> 44:55.235
I'll tell you something. If Jesus comes to
your house, all hell's gonna break loose.

44:56.916 --> 44:58.872
You got a point there, Ed Earl.

44:58.997 --> 45:02.353
But Jesus was really good to
Mary Magdalene, the fallen woman.

45:02.477 --> 45:04.752
He was always bein' very sociable.

45:04.877 --> 45:08.631
He went to this big weddin' once,
and they ran out of wine.

45:08.757 --> 45:11.510
You know what he did?
Turned the water into wine.

45:11.637 --> 45:14.515
Well, that's a man that knows
how to throw a party.

45:14.637 --> 45:16.628
Now, don't be sacrilegious.

45:16.957 --> 45:20.313
I'm not. I'm not.
He forgives me.

45:21.157 --> 45:23.910
- He knows I was kiddin'.
- I know he forgives you.

45:24.037 --> 45:27.473
That's funny, how God can forgive you
and people can't.

45:27.597 --> 45:32.625
- Now, why is that?
- Well, because people are not very godly.

45:34.198 --> 45:36.632
I know. I know.

45:38.678 --> 45:40.634
Yeah.

45:50.558 --> 45:52.514
<i>(chuckles)</i>

45:53.798 --> 45:55.754
What is it?

45:57.038 --> 46:01.316
Melvin P Thorpe is a sorry son of a bitch.

46:07.079 --> 46:10.196
You reckon he's gonna
run for the legislature?

46:10.319 --> 46:12.275
Why?

46:14.039 --> 46:16.075
I never told anybody this, Mona.

46:18.879 --> 46:22.155
I was thinkin' of runnin'
for the legislature someday.

46:22.279 --> 46:25.077
- Are you serious, Ed Earl?
- Yeah.

46:26.039 --> 46:29.634
They say an honest man can't be
elected in this country any more.

46:29.760 --> 46:32.354
But I don't believe that.

46:32.480 --> 46:35.199
This is a good country.

46:35.320 --> 46:37.197
I believe I could win.

46:37.320 --> 46:40.198
Well, you got my vote.
I might even go register.

46:41.080 --> 46:44.277
Boy, I sure didn't know
you had dreams that big.

46:44.400 --> 46:47.073
- People really do like you, though.
- They like you too.

46:47.200 --> 46:48.872
- Really?
- Sure.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.072
You ask anybody in town.
Say "How do you like Miss Mona?"

46:52.200 --> 46:54.714
They say "Shoot, she's a fine woman."

46:54.840 --> 46:57.035
"Fine, friendly and nice."

46:58.561 --> 47:01.871
I always just thought
if you see somebody without a smile...

47:02.001 --> 47:04.276
...give 'em yours.
- I like that.

47:05.921 --> 47:08.196
I like that.

47:08.321 --> 47:10.881
Think I'll use that as my campaign slogan.

47:11.521 --> 47:14.672
"If you see somebody without a smile,
give 'em yours."

47:14.921 --> 47:16.877
I'll have that printed up on a card.

47:17.001 --> 47:19.561
Oh, you're kiddin' me, you smart ass.

47:20.561 --> 47:22.836
I had a dream once.

47:22.961 --> 47:24.110
Yeah?

47:24.241 --> 47:27.278
- I'll tell you if you won't laugh.
- Oh, I won't laugh.

47:27.402 --> 47:30.360
Well, I used to dream
of bein' a ballerina.

47:31.762 --> 47:33.161
<i>(sniggers)</i>

47:33.282 --> 47:35.477
Now, Ed Earl, I ain't tellin' you nothin'.

47:35.602 --> 47:39.117
- Well... A ballerina?
- Yes, a ballerina!

47:39.242 --> 47:41.198
<i>(chuckles)</i>

47:41.842 --> 47:46.393
Well, I think that's wonderful. You still
could be a ballerina if you wanted to be.

47:46.522 --> 47:48.638
- Don't be ridiculous!
- No, you could!

47:48.762 --> 47:51.151
Go into training.
Just start jumpin' up and down.

47:51.282 --> 47:54.160
Me? Jumpin' up and down?
I'd black both my eyes.

47:55.203 --> 47:57.159
I couldn't now. I'm too top-heavy.

47:57.283 --> 48:02.232
I have a hard enough time balancin' these
things now, without gettin' on my toes.

48:08.803 --> 48:11.271
- You know somethin'?
- What?

48:11.403 --> 48:15.078
You know that, uh... I don't see
anybody but you any more.

48:16.163 --> 48:18.916
Course, you can't say the same, can you?

48:22.043 --> 48:26.673
I haven't been to bed with another woman
besides you in three years.

48:26.804 --> 48:28.954
You didn't know that, did you?

48:29.764 --> 48:31.914
No, I didn't know that.

48:33.924 --> 48:36.757
Nothin' better, once you've had the best.

48:36.884 --> 48:39.398
- Hey, I like that.
- I thought you would.

48:39.524 --> 48:43.722
Reckon if I was to run for the legislature
I could put that on my card?

48:59.205 --> 49:03.403
Up next, Melvin P Thorpe continues
his exposé of the Chicken Ranch...

49:03.525 --> 49:06.597
<i>...with a violent demonstration
in the Gilbert town square.</i>

49:06.725 --> 49:08.875
Great God from Goldsborough!

49:11.325 --> 49:13.281
<i>(phone rings)</i>

49:15.005 --> 49:17.314
Yeah?

49:17.805 --> 49:20.160
Ed Earl, you better turn on channel four.

49:20.845 --> 49:23.678
<i>That Melvin P Thorpe idiot's
got you on TV again.</i>

49:23.806 --> 49:25.842
Well, I don't give a shit, Rufus!

49:25.966 --> 49:28.605
<i>It's all very well to take
that attitude, Ed Earl...</i>

49:28.726 --> 49:30.398
Honey...

49:30.526 --> 49:33.802
Put on the television there. Channel four.

49:33.926 --> 49:37.714
That Melvin P Thorpe is
shootin' off his mouth again.

49:37.846 --> 49:40.235
What could be so goddamn important?

49:40.366 --> 49:44.518
Calm down, Rufus!
It can't be as bad as all that.

49:45.046 --> 49:48.721
<i>What happened to me as an individual
is not important.</i>

49:48.846 --> 49:52.077
<i>Is this the kind of man we want
runnin' our law enforcement?</i>

49:52.206 --> 49:57.758
<i>Is this the kind of foul-mouthed example
we wanna set for our innocent children?</i>

49:57.887 --> 49:59.036
<i>Run the film.</i>

49:59.167 --> 50:00.520
<i>Number three.</i>

50:00.647 --> 50:04.686
<i>No sawed-off little (bleep) is gonna
accuse me of takin' a bribe and live,...</i>

50:04.807 --> 50:06.763
<i>...cos I wear the badge
in this (bleep) county!</i>

50:06.887 --> 50:10.402
<i>- So you listen and you listen good, you...
- (bleeping)</i>

50:10.527 --> 50:13.678
<i>If I ever see you or any of those (bleep)
In my town again,...</i>

50:13.807 --> 50:16.560
<i>...I'm gonna knock you so flat you'll...
- (bleeping)</i>

50:17.527 --> 50:19.483
<i>(gunshots)</i>

50:22.328 --> 50:25.764
Ed Earl, that man
has made a fool out of you.

50:25.888 --> 50:27.844
<i>(gunshot)</i>

50:29.728 --> 50:33.767
I've had calls from preachers, deacons
and the presidents of two garden clubs!

50:33.888 --> 50:35.116
Thank you for callin'.

50:35.248 --> 50:38.558
The phones have been ringin' all mornin'.
Sheriff's office.

50:38.688 --> 50:43.239
I don't know why I serve as mayor
of this incorporated sand trap anyway!

50:43.768 --> 50:46.919
- What in the heck is keepin' him?
- He'll be along.

50:47.048 --> 50:50.836
- Well, he'd better!
- My wife couldn't believe what she saw.

50:50.968 --> 50:55.917
They bleeped him, but she read his lips
on every "hell", "goddamn" and "shit".

50:57.609 --> 51:01.397
<i>There's some folks gettin' up a petition
to close the Chicken Ranch.</i>

51:01.529 --> 51:04.168
All we wanted to do was keep it quiet.

51:04.289 --> 51:08.362
<i>Now, thanks to Ed Earl, it's the hottest
thing on the air since the Gong Show.</i>

51:08.489 --> 51:10.684
I'll tell him you called.
Mornin', Sheriff.

51:10.809 --> 51:12.640
- Mornin', Rita.
- Here's your calls.

51:12.769 --> 51:15.158
- Reckon you fellas are waitin' for me.
- We sure are!

51:15.289 --> 51:17.405
You don't know the trouble you've caused!

51:17.529 --> 51:21.158
Dad-gum it, Ed Earl!
If you ain't a pluperfect fool!

51:21.290 --> 51:25.249
You may be right. I got over a dozen
messages here from outraged citizens...

51:25.370 --> 51:27.964
...tellin' me we got a whorehouse
in Lanville County.

51:28.090 --> 51:30.445
Only been one here for about 150 years.

51:30.570 --> 51:33.368
Ed Earl, you can set up speed traps
to catch the tourists.

51:33.490 --> 51:37.244
You can look the other way when
a kid swipes a car to go joyridin'.

51:37.370 --> 51:39.406
You can even let Miss Mona run her place!

51:39.530 --> 51:43.318
But there's one thing you can't do:
Broadcast gutter talk on TV.

51:43.450 --> 51:47.489
- I didn't know they was takin' pictures.
- What were the cameras for?

51:47.610 --> 51:50.488
Damn it, CJ! You pious pissant.

51:51.251 --> 51:54.004
I don't have one tenth the trouble
from Miss Mona's...

51:54.131 --> 51:57.885
...that I have from one of your
stag parties at the legionnaire hall.

51:58.011 --> 52:00.320
- That ain't fair.
- There's just one thing to do.

52:00.451 --> 52:03.170
Close the place before we all
go to hell in a handbasket.

52:03.291 --> 52:04.644
Close it down!

52:04.771 --> 52:08.161
She was just fine as long as
she was makin' civic contributions...

52:08.291 --> 52:11.363
...but the moment her luck ran sour,
you want to run out on her.

52:11.491 --> 52:14.289
Run out on her like rats
from a burnin' barn!

52:14.411 --> 52:18.006
That's just it, Ed Earl.
Who's gonna put out that fire?

52:18.131 --> 52:21.328
Look, if you won't close her down,
tell her to lay low!

52:21.452 --> 52:24.205
Yeah. Just until the heat
wears off a little bit.

52:24.332 --> 52:26.800
Give it two months.
What's two months?

52:26.932 --> 52:29.685
Nobody tells me
how to run my goddamn job!

52:29.812 --> 52:31.768
And nobody gives me advice!

52:31.892 --> 52:35.851
I'll do things my own way.
I'm gonna make up my own damn mind!

52:36.972 --> 52:38.928
Two months.
What's two months?

52:39.052 --> 52:41.520
Shut down for two months!

52:41.652 --> 52:44.962
That is a hell of a lot
to ask somebody, Ed Earl.

52:45.092 --> 52:49.085
And that's a hell of a lot of overhead
to pay out when cash ain't comin' in.

52:49.213 --> 52:52.444
- What will I tell my girls?
- Well, maybe it won't be two months.

52:52.573 --> 52:56.851
The holidays are comin'. Maybe in a week
or two the whole thing will blow over...

52:56.973 --> 53:01.364
I warned you yesterday about
losin' your temper and carryin' on.

53:01.493 --> 53:06.123
- Last night you was proud of me.
- Last night I wasn't on the 11.00 news!

53:06.653 --> 53:09.770
I didn't know that son of a bitch
was gonna make an idiot out of me.

53:09.893 --> 53:14.091
I don't know about that electronic bullshit!
How was I supposed to handle that?

53:14.213 --> 53:17.683
That's your job, Ed Earl.
Ain't that what they pay you for?

53:17.813 --> 53:21.089
I know my job! Don't be tellin' me
what my goddamn job is!

53:21.214 --> 53:23.967
I could close this place down
in a New York minute!

53:24.094 --> 53:28.565
All I'm askin' for is a little cooperation
so I can get through a difficult situation...

53:28.694 --> 53:33.370
...with as little trouble as possible!
- OK, OK! I'll shut it down.

53:34.014 --> 53:37.131
- You will?
- What do you want? A written contract?

53:38.214 --> 53:41.524
- You promise?
- Ed Earl, I am givin' you my word.

53:46.054 --> 53:49.126
I'm sorry, Mona, about the whole situation.

53:49.255 --> 53:51.405
Don't feel sorry for me.

53:52.015 --> 53:55.610
I started out poor
and I worked my way up to outcast.

53:59.015 --> 54:03.008
I know what I'm askin' is gonna turn out
to be the best thing for both of us.

54:03.135 --> 54:05.490
Just trust me.

54:08.095 --> 54:10.325
You know what burns my ass?

54:10.455 --> 54:13.413
- What?
- A flame about three feet high.

54:14.615 --> 54:17.812
Of course I trust you, you big cowboy.
Ain't I always?

54:17.936 --> 54:19.449
Mm-hm.

54:19.576 --> 54:22.010
No need to stop now.

54:23.176 --> 54:25.007
Now get outta here.

54:25.136 --> 54:29.049
Everything's gonna turn out just fine.
Don't you worry about a thing, honey.

54:29.176 --> 54:31.770
Everything's gonna turn out
slicker than cat shit...

54:31.896 --> 54:34.251
...on a linoleum floor.

54:34.376 --> 54:35.525
<i>(laughs)</i>

54:39.216 --> 54:43.414
Well, if it ain't the celebrated
cussin' Sheriff of Lanville County.

54:43.536 --> 54:46.289
- How are you, Sheriff?
- I'm fine. How are you, Porky?

54:46.417 --> 54:50.092
Oh, Sheriff! I been real good all week.
I've lost six pounds.

54:50.217 --> 54:53.448
Oh, yeah? Well, don't take nothin'
off them cheeks.

54:53.577 --> 54:55.772
Oh, go on.

54:55.897 --> 54:57.853
<i>(laughs) Whoa!</i>

54:59.417 --> 55:01.772
Well, Jewel, I just promised the sheriff...

55:01.897 --> 55:04.252
...that we're gonna shut down
for two months.

55:04.377 --> 55:06.766
What? How can you promise that?

55:06.897 --> 55:11.095
What about the football game
celebration tomorrow night?

55:11.217 --> 55:14.448
- I forgot all about that.
- It's the Thanksgiving game.

55:14.577 --> 55:17.137
- That's real special.
- I know, Jewel!

55:17.258 --> 55:19.692
I don't know what to do now.
I did promise.

55:19.818 --> 55:24.096
You think, if we close the doors, just
went on as planned, that'd be all right?

55:24.218 --> 55:28.575
I'm sure it will, honey. That party
is a bigger tradition than the game.

55:33.778 --> 55:34.733
<i>(crowd cheering)</i>

55:36.138 --> 55:39.016
65,000-plus on hand
here at Kyle Field...

55:39.138 --> 55:41.698
...and we have seen
an amazing ball game.

55:41.818 --> 55:45.208
Texas A&M heavily favoured,
but we're tied 12-12.

55:45.339 --> 55:49.969
Aggies have the ball, second down
at eight. Time is winding down.

55:50.099 --> 55:54.251
<i>They try the middle of the Texas defence
and again the break is stopped.</i>

55:54.379 --> 55:57.451

- Whoo-wee!</i>

55:58.499 --> 56:00.535
Whoo!

56:01.739 --> 56:06.176
String up the white. We'll see who wins
and put up the orange or the maroon.

56:06.299 --> 56:08.255
Yes, ma'am.

56:09.219 --> 56:12.416
- I can't stand it if them Aggies win.
- What do you mean?

56:12.539 --> 56:17.374
They're such animals. Always yellin'
and jumpin' about and sayin' "yee-ha".

56:17.500 --> 56:21.573
They have to go for all the marbles,
they will have to throw right now.

56:21.700 --> 56:24.976
Time running out. Miller rolls to the right.
Pass! Touchdown!

56:26.620 --> 56:28.258

56:54.061 --> 56:57.940
Boys, boys! That was
the greatest victory...

56:58.061 --> 57:00.450
...since General Eisenhower won!

57:00.781 --> 57:05.252
Senator, you ain't forgot you was gonna
take us to the Chicken Ranch, did ya?

57:05.381 --> 57:09.374
- Yeah! How about it?
- I always keep my campaign promises.

57:10.181 --> 57:15.050
The Chicken Ranch is a fine institution
and I'm proud to have it in my district.

57:15.182 --> 57:18.140

Melvin P Thorpe says.

gonna do? I can tell you - nothin'!

it ain't worth armadillo crap.

Where were you? I couldn't get you...

your word you were closin' down.

You use that damn Dulcie Mae
as your in-town wife.

01:13:39.975 --> 01:13:42.045
You even use that little boy of hers...

01:13:42.175 --> 01:13:44.848
...so you can play weekend daddy!
- Leave him out of it!

01:13:44.975 --> 01:13:49.969
You're playin'. You're just a big,
overgrown kid playin' at bein' a man!

01:13:50.095 --> 01:13:53.132
I don't have to listen to this shit. Damn it!

01:13:53.256 --> 01:13:57.454
I'm the law. If I choose to, I'll close
this place down till hell freezes over.

01:13:57.576 --> 01:14:01.694
Don't you threaten me.
I'm tellin' the truth, and you know it!

01:14:01.816 --> 01:14:05.695
And all of your big dreams
of goin' to the legislature.

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:10.571
They're just dreams, cos you ain't never
gonna be no more than you are right now.

01:14:10.696 --> 01:14:14.006
A chickenshit sheriff
in a chickenshit town.

01:14:16.536 --> 01:14:20.324
You may be right. It's a hell of a lot
better than bein' a whore.

01:15:20.859 --> 01:15:24.135
<i>Legalised prostitution, pro or con,
is in the news today.</i>

01:15:24.259 --> 01:15:27.729
<i>For a report, here is
Jeff Gerald in Gilbert, Texas.</i>

01:15:29.139 --> 01:15:31.778
The Chicken Ranch,
the legendary bawdyhouse...

01:15:31.899 --> 01:15:36.051
...is showing little activity after the
disclosure of the Thanksgiving-night raid.

01:15:36.179 --> 01:15:39.694
- Get away!
- The deputy keeps away onlookers...

01:15:39.819 --> 01:15:44.131
...while up at the house the doors are
closed and the principals are not talking.

01:15:44.579 --> 01:15:46.968
<i>The Sheriff of Gilbert
refused interviews,...</i>

01:15:47.099 --> 01:15:50.694
<i>...while in Houston the man who launched
the campaign, Melvin P Thorpe,...</i>

01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:52.776
<i>...held a press conference today.</i>

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:55.289
This report says that the Chicken Ranch...

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:59.413
...is involved with and under the influence
of organised crime.

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:04.091
I am gonna take this report to Austin
in the hopes that the governor himself...

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:08.338
...will come out of his long silence
on this issue and uphold the law.

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:11.532
<i>- (applause)
- Thank you. Thank you very much.</i>

01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:13.936
<i>The governor made no statement,...</i>

01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:17.575
<i>...but Senator Charles Wingwood,
a principal figure in the raid,...</i>

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:20.419
<i>...held a press conference
explaining his involvement.</i>

01:16:20.541 --> 01:16:24.056
I have no independent recollection
of going to the Chicken Ranch.

01:16:24.181 --> 01:16:28.697
I can only say, as the most dedicated
anti-Communist in the state legislature...

01:16:28.821 --> 01:16:32.700
...that I must have been drugged by
Communists or Communist sympathisers...

01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:36.496
...and placed there to harm
my reputation and good name.

01:16:36.621 --> 01:16:38.976
Reaction across the state
is split 50-50.

01:16:39.101 --> 01:16:42.173
But here in Gilbert,
the Chicken Ranch has many supporters.

01:16:42.301 --> 01:16:46.738
I ain't never seen anything bad come out
of there, and I've lived here all my life.

01:16:46.861 --> 01:16:49.739
Why, they attract a lot
of business to the community.

01:16:49.862 --> 01:16:52.422
They pay their taxes,
just like you and me!

01:16:53.142 --> 01:16:56.578
No one... no one was ever
forced to go up there.

01:16:56.742 --> 01:16:59.893
My Frank, when he was alive,
used to go up there every Saturday.

01:17:00.022 --> 01:17:04.061
I took it as a blessin'.
Of course, things were different then.

01:17:04.182 --> 01:17:08.095
Nowadays women enjoy doin'
that sort of thing themselves.

01:17:08.222 --> 01:17:10.372
At least, so I've been told.

01:17:10.502 --> 01:17:13.300
The Chicken Ranch?
I think it's a good idea.

01:17:13.422 --> 01:17:16.573
See, you take young boys
and they're gonna be lookin' for women.

01:17:16.702 --> 01:17:19.614
If they can't find 'em, they'll rape 'em.
And if they don't...

01:17:19.743 --> 01:17:23.656
...they'll run to other women and get
diseases! Those girls went to doctors.

01:17:23.783 --> 01:17:27.298
Although petitions are being circulated
to save the Chicken Ranch...

01:17:27.423 --> 01:17:30.062
...this bumper sticker
is beginning to appear.

01:17:30.503 --> 01:17:35.372
<i>And so, as feminists support the bill for
the decriminalisation of prostitution...</i>

01:17:35.503 --> 01:17:38.779
<i>...while traditionalists
lobby for its defeat,...</i>

01:17:38.903 --> 01:17:43.419
<i>...the fate of the Chicken Ranch rests with
the governor, who again was unavailable.</i>

01:17:43.783 --> 01:17:46.013
<i>Jeff Gerald, ABC News,
Gilbert, Texas.</i>

01:17:46.143 --> 01:17:48.099
<i>Thank you, Jeff. If there are...</i>

01:17:49.864 --> 01:17:52.253
Well, I hate admitting
I was wrong, Miss Mona.

01:17:52.384 --> 01:17:55.137
But with television broadcasting all this...

01:17:55.264 --> 01:17:59.780
...we should've done what the sheriff said
and kept this place closed.

01:17:59.904 --> 01:18:02.702
It was my fault, Jewel. It was my decision.

01:18:02.824 --> 01:18:05.418
He ain't gonna be able to stop it
this time, is he?

01:18:05.544 --> 01:18:08.980
No. He'd like to,
but he's out of his league.

01:18:09.104 --> 01:18:11.174
He don't know how to fight 'em.

01:18:11.304 --> 01:18:15.183
He's just a good old boy
that ain't never gonna grow up.

01:18:15.304 --> 01:18:17.613
Honey, we see everything
in this profession.

01:18:17.745 --> 01:18:21.420
But one thing I ain't never seen,
man nor woman, is a grown-up.

01:18:21.545 --> 01:18:24.343
Don't be too hard on him.
He loves you.

01:18:28.305 --> 01:18:31.058
Well, he ain't never said it.

01:18:31.185 --> 01:18:33.938
Some men can't say the words, honey.

01:18:34.065 --> 01:18:37.296
But that don't mean
they don't feel it in their heart.

01:18:37.825 --> 01:18:40.942
Well, it's just as well anyhow, Jewel.

01:18:41.065 --> 01:18:43.704
I set my course a long time ago...

01:18:44.705 --> 01:18:47.060
...and I can't go changin' now.

01:18:51.506 --> 01:18:56.421
I don't know what to do. Folks got nothin'
to talk about but this Chicken Ranch mess.

01:18:56.546 --> 01:18:59.379
Like a broken record:
Chicken Ranch, Chicken Ranch...

01:18:59.506 --> 01:19:02.339
All of this bad publicity's
flat ruinin' business.

01:19:02.466 --> 01:19:06.220
- I haven't sold a car in a week.
- It's ruinin' the town.

01:19:06.346 --> 01:19:09.418
No one's blamin' you, Ed Earl.
It ain't your fault.

01:19:09.546 --> 01:19:12.344
But we can't just sit around here
waitin' to grow tits!

01:19:12.466 --> 01:19:15.344
The way I see it, the Chicken Ranch
served a purpose once.

01:19:15.467 --> 01:19:17.423
But now everything's openin' up.

01:19:17.547 --> 01:19:21.062
Do you know we are in the middle
of a worldwide sexual revolution?

01:19:21.187 --> 01:19:23.906
Why, Miss Mona's ain't obscene,
it's just obsolete.

01:19:24.027 --> 01:19:27.019
She ain't got a handful
of supporters left, Ed Earl.

01:19:27.267 --> 01:19:32.022
All this publicity's makin' folks think twice
about signin' that petition.

01:19:32.147 --> 01:19:36.857
Why can't that station in Houston look at
the cesspool in their own back yard?

01:19:36.987 --> 01:19:39.865
How about Austin?
Two blocks from the state capitol...

01:19:39.987 --> 01:19:43.343
...you can have anything done to you
that you can get in Tangiers!

01:19:43.467 --> 01:19:45.742
There's naked massages, tongue baths...

01:19:45.868 --> 01:19:48.257
...somebody ticklin' your ass with a feather.

01:19:48.388 --> 01:19:52.176
If you know that for a fact,
Mr Newspaper Editor...

01:19:52.308 --> 01:19:54.264
...it's your duty to expose it!

01:19:54.388 --> 01:19:59.098
Now, you see here, CJ! I don't give
a damn if folks want their ass tickled!

01:19:59.228 --> 01:20:02.584
I kinda like to think that
that's what heaven is all about.

01:20:04.948 --> 01:20:08.623
Boys, I got myself
a pretty good bullshit detector.

01:20:08.748 --> 01:20:13.264
I can tell when somebody's peein' on
my boots and tellin' me it's a rainstorm.

01:20:13.388 --> 01:20:16.937
Now, this thing's gotten way outta hand.
I don't know how.

01:20:17.069 --> 01:20:20.425
- I figure there's only one thing to do.
- Close it down!

01:20:20.789 --> 01:20:23.747
Nope. I'm goin' to Austin.

01:20:23.869 --> 01:20:27.782
See the governor. Tell him
Miss Mona's side of the situation.

01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:31.223
He sure as hell won't hear about it
from anybody here.

01:20:31.349 --> 01:20:34.659
- You can't go up and see the governor!
- He don't see anybody!

01:20:34.789 --> 01:20:36.939
He'll see me.

01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:52.465
Feel like the country dog in the city.
If I stand still, they screw me.

01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:55.058
<i>- If I run, they bite me in the ass.
- (laughs)</i>

01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:58.305
I... I wish...

01:20:58.430 --> 01:21:00.864
...there was somethin' I could do.

01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:02.946
Thank you.

01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:08.826
They want me to close her down,
run her out of town.

01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:16.104
How can I ask her to leave,
when all I want her to do is stay?

01:21:35.631 --> 01:21:40.625
Ladies and gentlemen,
His Excellency, the Governor of Texas.

01:21:43.512 --> 01:21:47.903
My friends, I want to thank you for that
sincere and heartwarming ovation.

01:21:48.032 --> 01:21:49.988
No questions, please.

01:21:50.112 --> 01:21:53.309
Governor, what do you think of
the crisis in the Middle East?

01:21:53.432 --> 01:21:57.311
I was sayin' at the weekly prayer
breakfast in this historic capitol...

01:21:57.432 --> 01:21:59.662
...that it behooves
the Jews and the Arabs...

01:21:59.792 --> 01:22:03.467
...to settle their differences
in a christian manner.

01:22:03.592 --> 01:22:07.983
Have you seen the evidence of the
disgraceful situation at the Chicken Ranch?

01:22:10.312 --> 01:22:14.590
} Fellow Texans, I am proudly

01:22:15.073 --> 01:22:19.271
} Standing here to humbly say

01:22:20.233 --> 01:22:22.189
} I assure you

01:22:22.313 --> 01:22:24.383
} And I mean it

01:22:24.513 --> 01:22:29.064
} Now, who says I don't speak out
as plain as day?

01:22:29.193 --> 01:22:31.149
} And fellow Texans

01:22:31.913 --> 01:22:35.349
} I'm for progress and the flag

01:22:35.473 --> 01:22:38.510
} Long may it fly

01:22:39.793 --> 01:22:43.342
} I'm a poor boy
come to greatness

01:22:45.194 --> 01:22:48.664
} So it follows
that I cannot tell a lie

01:22:50.274 --> 01:22:54.028
- What the hell did he say?
- Same as usual. Not a damn thing.

01:22:58.314 --> 01:23:01.511
} Ooh, I love to dance
a little sidestep

01:23:01.914 --> 01:23:04.951
} Now they see me, now they don't,
I've come and gone

01:23:05.074 --> 01:23:08.669
} And ooh, I love to sweep
around the wide step

01:23:09.074 --> 01:23:12.111
} Cut a little swath
and lead the people on

01:23:16.075 --> 01:23:17.633
- Governor!
- Yeah.

01:23:17.755 --> 01:23:20.872
<i>- Jerry Rogers of the Houston Post.
- Hi, Jerry.</i>

01:23:20.995 --> 01:23:24.829
Governor, do you plan to take action
against the Chicken Ranch?

01:23:24.955 --> 01:23:28.391
} Now, my good friends,
it behooves me

01:23:28.675 --> 01:23:31.348
} To be solemn and declare

01:23:32.315 --> 01:23:35.068
} I'm for goodness and for profit

01:23:35.955 --> 01:23:39.391
} And for living clean
and saying daily prayer

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:42.712
} And now, my good friends,
you can sleep nights

01:23:43.236 --> 01:23:46.194
} I'll continue to stand tall

01:23:46.876 --> 01:23:49.868
} You can trust me
for I promise

01:23:50.516 --> 01:23:54.270
} I shall keep a watchful eye
upon y'all

01:23:57.836 --> 01:24:01.146
- Did you get that?

been so long ignored?

We have acoustic problems in here.

- Melvin, I'm sorry.

} But of course I have
no close contact

Governor? I have Sheriff Dodd from Gilbert
waiting outside to see you.

01:26:24.521 --> 01:26:28.150
He's been here since early this morning
and is very insistent.

01:26:28.281 --> 01:26:30.590
Swearin' Sheriff Dodd?
The one on TV?

Hi, Sheriff!

01:26:34.561 --> 01:26:36.836
Just talkin' about you.
How are ya?

01:26:36.962 --> 01:26:39.760
Governor, I know I'm way outta line
comin' up here...

01:26:39.882 --> 01:26:42.919
...but before you close the Chicken Ranch
you must know the facts.

01:26:43.042 --> 01:26:46.000
I haven't made that decision!
My aides are workin' on that.

01:26:46.122 --> 01:26:50.434
Well, the Chicken Ranch has been
in my county since before I was born.

01:26:50.762 --> 01:26:54.960
Its doors have been open to soldiers
and presidents and farmers.

01:26:55.762 --> 01:26:59.675
Even governors who can remember
what a great institution it is.

01:27:00.482 --> 01:27:02.950
- No need to bring that up.
- I ain't threatenin' you.

01:27:03.082 --> 01:27:05.801
Whatever you say, I'll do.
But think of the people.

01:27:05.923 --> 01:27:09.154
I've known Miss Mona for 12 years.
You'll never meet a finer woman.

01:27:09.283 --> 01:27:12.355
She never refuses a charity.
The whole town likes her.

01:27:12.483 --> 01:27:15.953
Hospital fund, new swimmin' pool,
even the Little Leaguers.

01:27:16.083 --> 01:27:19.917
She bought 'em uniforms so they wouldn't
have to play in their overalls.

01:27:20.043 --> 01:27:21.999
Well...

01:27:22.803 --> 01:27:25.954
I wasn't aware of her civic generosity.

01:27:27.803 --> 01:27:30.636
- But the law is the law!
- Sometimes it's gotta be changed.

01:27:30.763 --> 01:27:34.517
I been fightin' crime all my life,
but let's not confuse crime with sin.

01:27:34.644 --> 01:27:38.717
You can't legislate morality.
Those girls have never caused any trouble.

01:27:38.844 --> 01:27:41.802
They're healthy, taxpayin',
law-abidin' citizens...

01:27:41.924 --> 01:27:45.553
...who supply a demand and provide
an economic asset to the community.

01:27:45.684 --> 01:27:47.834
Whew! Ed Earl!

01:27:48.804 --> 01:27:51.955
You ever think about
runnin' for office? Huh?

01:27:52.084 --> 01:27:57.636
I swear, you make that whorehouse sound
like a damn nonprofit recreational facility.

01:27:57.764 --> 01:28:02.713
Governor, if the citizens who elected me
found it necessary to close it down...

01:28:02.844 --> 01:28:04.436
...I would close it down.

01:28:04.565 --> 01:28:07.159
If Miss Mona and the girls
that work for her...

01:28:07.285 --> 01:28:10.436
...were jeopardisin' the health
or morals of the community...

01:28:10.565 --> 01:28:12.123
...I would close it down.

01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:15.840
If the place was just a piddlin' nuisance,
an eyesore, a fire hazard...

01:28:15.965 --> 01:28:18.399
...I would close it down!
But there's nothin'!

01:28:18.525 --> 01:28:20.880
No reason except the goddamn cries...

01:28:21.005 --> 01:28:24.634
...of a muckrakin' sensationalist
on television.

01:28:24.765 --> 01:28:28.155
Here they are, Governor.
What you've been waitin' for.

01:28:29.845 --> 01:28:31.801
Oh, I'm sorry, Ed Earl.

01:28:31.925 --> 01:28:35.600
The Chicken Ranch loses,
42 to 37, with 21% undecided.

01:28:35.726 --> 01:28:37.318
- What is that?
- The polls.

01:28:37.446 --> 01:28:40.119
You can't expect me
to go against the polls.

01:28:40.246 --> 01:28:42.965
Melvin still outside?
Maybe I can catch the cameras.

01:28:43.086 --> 01:28:46.476
- Good seein' ya.
- But it's not what my people want.

01:28:47.086 --> 01:28:49.725
Show's over, Sheriff.
Close it down!

01:28:59.086 --> 01:29:00.917
<i>- (crowd) Hooray!
- Ha-ha!</i>

01:29:03.727 --> 01:29:06.560
} Melvin Thorpe
has done it once again

01:29:06.687 --> 01:29:10.157
} He's shone his light and now we see

01:29:10.927 --> 01:29:13.805
} Melvin Thorpe will go
through thick and thin

01:29:13.927 --> 01:29:17.283
} And lead us on to victory

01:29:18.287 --> 01:29:21.484
} Ooh, I love to dance
a little sidestep

01:29:21.887 --> 01:29:25.084
} Now they see me, now they don't,
I've come and gone

01:29:25.207 --> 01:29:28.677
} And ooh, I love to sweep
around the wide step

01:29:29.247 --> 01:29:32.284
} Cut a little swath
and lead the people on

01:29:32.728 --> 01:29:35.640
} Melvin Thorpe
has done it once again

01:29:35.768 --> 01:29:39.158
} He's shone his light and now we see

01:29:39.968 --> 01:29:42.766
} Melvin Thorpe will go
through thick and thin

01:29:42.888 --> 01:29:46.676
} And lead us on to victory

01:29:48.008 --> 01:29:50.966
} Melvin Thorpe
has done it once again

01:29:51.088 --> 01:29:54.876
} He's shone his light and now we see

01:29:55.008 --> 01:29:58.523
I'd love to see
that sheriff's face right now!

01:29:59.088 --> 01:30:02.285
That Chicken Ranch
is gonna get it in the neck!

01:30:02.889 --> 01:30:06.086
And Miss Mona, she's gonna get hers too.

01:30:09.649 --> 01:30:12.447
} Melvin Thorpe will go
through thick and thin

01:30:12.569 --> 01:30:19.520
} And lead us all to victory

01:30:22.689 --> 01:30:24.839
<i>(Ed Earl) Sorry son of a bitch.</i>

01:30:41.890 --> 01:30:44.358
<i>(phone rings)</i>

01:30:58.130 --> 01:31:00.121
Hello.

01:31:00.251 --> 01:31:02.446
Mona, this is an official call.

01:31:03.371 --> 01:31:06.090
As the Sheriff of Lanville County,
it's my duty...

01:31:06.211 --> 01:31:09.203
Why don't you just get to the point,
Sheriff?

01:31:10.491 --> 01:31:13.403
- I gotta close you down.
- I see.

01:31:15.371 --> 01:31:17.407
How long do we have?

01:31:17.531 --> 01:31:19.806
<i>Be better to do it
as soon as possible.</i>

01:31:22.211 --> 01:31:24.486
I understand.

01:31:24.611 --> 01:31:26.567
Mona.

01:31:27.331 --> 01:31:29.481
About the other night.

01:31:31.132 --> 01:31:33.282
I lost my temper.

01:31:34.452 --> 01:31:36.920
I said some things
I shouldn't have said.

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:40.248
I want to apologise.

01:31:40.372 --> 01:31:42.283
Oh, it's all right, Ed Earl.

01:31:42.412 --> 01:31:45.768
I think we both said
a whole lot of things we regret.

01:31:45.892 --> 01:31:47.769
<i>If there's anything I can do...</i>

01:31:47.892 --> 01:31:51.282
No, thank you.
I think you've done all you could.

01:31:51.412 --> 01:31:53.368
I have to tell my girls.

01:32:20.853 --> 01:32:22.809
<i>(bell)</i>

01:32:26.133 --> 01:32:28.283
Well, the news has come.

01:32:29.094 --> 01:32:31.289
Just got a call from the sheriff...

01:32:31.414 --> 01:32:33.325
...and we are closed down.

01:32:33.454 --> 01:32:35.410
Immediately and permanently.

01:32:37.174 --> 01:32:39.813
Oh... What'll we do?

01:32:40.614 --> 01:32:43.651
Well... Las Vegas, here I come.

01:32:44.014 --> 01:32:47.689
Damn! I thought when the sheriff
went to speak to the governor...

01:32:47.814 --> 01:32:50.692
...we'd get a reprieve.
- What did you say?

01:32:51.174 --> 01:32:55.452
- Didn't you know about that, Miss Mona?
- He drove up last night.

01:32:55.574 --> 01:32:59.123
The whole town's talkin' about
the way he fought for you.

01:32:59.255 --> 01:33:01.371
Didn't he tell you that?

01:33:01.495 --> 01:33:03.884
No. No, he didn't.

01:33:32.936 --> 01:33:36.565
} Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair

01:33:38.656 --> 01:33:41.011
} Maybe I'll move somewhere

01:33:41.136 --> 01:33:43.092
} Maybe I'll get a car

01:33:43.456 --> 01:33:48.371
} Maybe I'll drive so far
they'll all lose track

01:33:48.776 --> 01:33:51.927
} Me, I'll bounce right back

01:33:52.856 --> 01:33:54.926
} Maybe I'll sleep real late

01:33:57.577 --> 01:33:59.647
} Maybe I'll lose some weight

01:34:00.017 --> 01:34:02.167
} Maybe I'll clear my junk

01:34:02.297 --> 01:34:07.530
} Maybe I'll just get drunk
on apple wine

01:34:07.737 --> 01:34:13.255
} Me, I'll be just fine and dandy

01:34:13.537 --> 01:34:17.735
} Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas

01:34:17.977 --> 01:34:22.334
} I'm barely gettin' through tomorrow

01:34:22.577 --> 01:34:26.968
} But still I won't let
sorrow bring me way down

01:34:27.458 --> 01:34:31.451
} I'll be fine and dandy

01:34:32.098 --> 01:34:36.330
} Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas

01:34:36.458 --> 01:34:40.690
} I'm barely gettin' through tomorrow

01:34:41.018 --> 01:34:46.217
} But still I won't let
sorrow bring me way down

01:34:49.378 --> 01:34:53.087
} Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew

01:34:54.618 --> 01:34:57.928
} Hey, maybe I'll just lie low

01:34:58.059 --> 01:35:00.129
} Maybe I'll hit the bars

01:35:00.259 --> 01:35:05.174
} Maybe I'll count the stars
until the dawn

01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:09.294
} Me, I will go on

01:35:09.659 --> 01:35:12.014
} Maybe I'll settle down

01:35:14.259 --> 01:35:16.454
} Maybe I'll just leave town

01:35:16.579 --> 01:35:18.615
} Maybe I'll have some fun

01:35:18.939 --> 01:35:23.649
} Maybe I'll meet someone
and make him mine

01:35:24.059 --> 01:35:29.452
} Me, I'll be just fine and dandy

01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:33.973
} Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas

01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:38.492
} I'm barely gettin' through tomorrow

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:43.091
} But still I won't let
sorrow bring me way down

01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:47.613
} I'll be fine and dandy

01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:52.338
} Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas

01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:56.692
} I'm barely gettin' through tomorrow

01:35:56.981 --> 01:36:01.259
} But still I won't let
sorrow bring me way down

01:36:03.981 --> 01:36:07.940
} I'll be fine and dandy

01:36:08.501 --> 01:36:12.574
} Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas

01:36:12.901 --> 01:36:17.133
} I'm barely gettin' through tomorrow

01:36:17.381 --> 01:36:21.818
} But still I won't let
sorrow bring me way down

01:36:42.782 --> 01:36:46.855
<i>} I'll be fine</i>

01:36:47.382 --> 01:36:51.455
<i>} I'll be fine</i>

01:36:52.062 --> 01:36:57.056
<i>} I'll be fine</i>

01:37:10.863 --> 01:37:15.254
So the girls left, and it was
a sorry day for Lanville County.

01:37:18.223 --> 01:37:20.179
Kinda like the end of an era.

01:37:20.663 --> 01:37:23.541
You know, like when you graduate
from high school?

01:37:23.664 --> 01:37:25.939
Things are just never the same again.

01:37:28.024 --> 01:37:31.096
Ed Earl's up in the state legislature now...

01:37:31.224 --> 01:37:33.374
...and I became the sheriff.

01:37:39.784 --> 01:37:42.378
I suppose you're wonderin'
what happened to Miss Mona.

01:37:42.504 --> 01:37:45.940
Well, Ed Earl drove up there
on her last day.

01:38:01.465 --> 01:38:03.740
- Hey, Sheriff.
- Good morning, Jewel.

01:38:03.865 --> 01:38:07.221
I'm so pleased to see you.
I knew you couldn't let me leave...

01:38:07.345 --> 01:38:10.337
...without a sweet goodbye
for your old Porky.

01:38:12.665 --> 01:38:15.020
- Goodbye, Jewel.
- Goodbye, Sheriff.

01:38:15.145 --> 01:38:18.057
I sure hope you come up north
to visit Miss Mona and me.

01:38:18.185 --> 01:38:20.335
- Where is she?
- Inside.

01:38:22.386 --> 01:38:24.980
See you're takin' the old juke with you.

01:38:25.106 --> 01:38:28.781
Now, you know I couldn't leave
without my bell and my box.

01:39:10.667 --> 01:39:13.101
Ed Earl?

01:39:14.707 --> 01:39:17.346
This old place looks
kinda funny, don't it?

01:39:17.787 --> 01:39:22.781
Ben Sawtuck bought all my furniture and
Langston downtown's gonna sell the rest.

01:39:27.468 --> 01:39:31.177
- Mona, I wanna tell you somethin'.
- I want you to thank your boys for me.

01:39:31.308 --> 01:39:36.098
Those reporters would have got outta hand
if it hadn't been for your deputies.

01:39:37.668 --> 01:39:40.626
- You know me better than...
- Ed Earl, the thing to do...

01:39:40.748 --> 01:39:44.502
...is to put this whole thing behind you
just as quick as you can.

01:39:44.628 --> 01:39:47.825
I've made a little money, I've laughed,
I've danced to the music.

01:39:47.948 --> 01:39:50.940
It's just time to pay the fiddler, that's all.

01:39:53.389 --> 01:39:56.347
Mona, we've been together a long time.

01:39:56.469 --> 01:39:59.859
Sometimes I think you know me
better than I know myself.

01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:03.424
You know how hard
this is for me to say.

01:40:05.549 --> 01:40:07.505
I love you.

01:40:09.429 --> 01:40:11.340
Will you marry me?

01:40:11.469 --> 01:40:14.859
Oh, Ed Earl, I've loved you
since I was 16 years old.

01:40:15.389 --> 01:40:18.142
But I've thought about this
for a long time.

01:40:18.269 --> 01:40:20.544
And as much as I'd love
for it to work...

01:40:20.670 --> 01:40:24.026
...I know deep down in my heart
it ain't never gonna be.

01:40:24.150 --> 01:40:26.869
- Didn't you hear what I said?
- I did, darlin'.

01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:29.504
But it's gonna always be
just like it is.

01:40:30.150 --> 01:40:32.903
There just ain't no way
in this world it can work.

01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:36.662
<i>We could make it work.
Just have to give it a chance.</i>

01:40:38.670 --> 01:40:43.300
} If I should stay

01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:49.824
} Well, I would only be in your way

01:40:51.511 --> 01:40:54.469
} And so I'll go

01:40:55.031 --> 01:40:57.989
} And yet I know

01:40:58.671 --> 01:41:03.699
} That I'll think of you
each step of the way

01:41:06.271 --> 01:41:09.183
} And I

01:41:09.831 --> 01:41:14.905
} Will always love you

01:41:15.031 --> 01:41:19.627
} I will always

01:41:19.752 --> 01:41:23.984
} Love you

01:41:26.712 --> 01:41:31.342
} Bittersweet memories

01:41:33.512 --> 01:41:38.381
} I guess that's all
I'll be takin' with me

01:41:41.032 --> 01:41:42.988
} Goodbye

01:41:43.352 --> 01:41:45.502
} Oh, please, don't cry

01:41:46.753 --> 01:41:53.909
} Cos we both know
that I'm not what you need

01:41:54.353 --> 01:41:57.072
} But I

01:41:57.433 --> 01:42:02.791
} Will always love you

01:42:02.913 --> 01:42:07.145
} I will always

01:42:07.593 --> 01:42:11.552
} Love you

01:42:16.834 --> 01:42:19.268
I know you're gonna get your dream.

01:42:20.034 --> 01:42:23.709
And I know you're gonna do
a real good job in the legislature.

01:42:24.834 --> 01:42:27.871
- But if you was to marry me...
- Wait a second.

01:42:28.634 --> 01:42:30.829
I love you.

01:42:31.514 --> 01:42:34.108
I don't give a damn what people say.

01:42:39.634 --> 01:42:40.828
Jewel! Hold it right there!

01:42:40.954 --> 01:42:42.910
What's that, Sheriff?

01:42:45.475 --> 01:42:48.228
- Which one of them bags is hers?
- That one.

01:42:49.035 --> 01:42:51.833
And that one there, there...

01:42:59.195 --> 01:43:00.992
Oh, Sheriff!

01:43:03.795 --> 01:43:06.263
I always knew you'd come through!

01:43:20.756 --> 01:43:22.712
Whoa!

01:44:17.878 --> 01:44:21.791
<i>(Fred) Well, that's pretty darn close
to the way it happened.</i>

01:44:21.918 --> 01:44:25.513
<i>The old Watchdog, Melvin P Thorpe,
got what he wanted.</i>

01:44:26.558 --> 01:44:30.028
<i>Miss Mona married Ed Earl,
and they got what they wanted.</i>

01:44:30.918 --> 01:44:35.070
<i>And the people of Texas,
well, they got what they wanted:</i>

01:44:35.198 --> 01:44:39.237
<i>Another legend.
The legend of the Chicken Ranch.</i>

01:44:40.238 --> 01:44:43.355
<i>} It's just a little bitty
pissant country place</i>

01:44:43.599 --> 01:44:45.157
<i>} Nothin' much to see</i>

01:44:45.279 --> 01:44:47.839
<i>} No drinkin' allowed
we get a nice quiet crowd</i>

01:44:47.959 --> 01:44:49.187
<i>} Plain as it can be</i>

01:44:49.319 --> 01:44:52.629
<i>} It's just a piddly, squattin'
old-time country place</i>

01:44:52.759 --> 01:44:54.317
<i>} Nothin' too high-toned</i>

01:44:54.439 --> 01:44:56.589
<i>} Just lots of goodwill
and maybe one small thrill</i>

01:44:56.719 --> 01:44:58.311
<i>} But there's nothin' dirty goin' on</i>

01:44:58.439 --> 01:45:01.715
<i>} It's just a little bitty
pissant country place</i>

01:45:01.839 --> 01:45:03.397
<i>} Nothin' much to see</i>

01:45:03.519 --> 01:45:05.953
<i>} No drinkin' allowed,

01:45:06.079 --> 01:45:07.478

01:45:07.599 --> 01:45:10.750

old-time country place</i>

01:45:10.879 --> 01:45:12.517

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.950
