00:16.000 --> 00:32.603
Always with us, you will always be with us.

00:52.704 --> 00:57.704
- Word of the Lord. - Glory to you, Lord Jesus.

01:04.605 --> 01:09.905
Bruno could not come, but I wanted much to Daniele.

01:10.906 --> 01:13.506
It was his best friend.

01:13.707 --> 01:17.207
I have no words, Ms. Angela.

01:32.808 --> 01:36.208
We all know that today has not died a hero,

01:37.409 --> 01:41.709
but how much responsibility can have Daniele,

01:43.310 --> 01:45.910
remaining 16 years.

01:45.911 --> 01:48.911
Children of families who are born in other parts of Italy,

01:48.912 --> 01:51.612
have opportunities here have been denied.

01:51.613 --> 01:55.413
There are no colors. Everything is gray.

01:55.414 --> 01:58.014
There are no places to develop good

01:58.015 --> 02:02.815
the talents of our children. This is a dormitory suburb.

02:04.116 --> 02:06.316
Here people want to stay locked at home

02:06.317 --> 02:08.616
should not leave, do not interfere.

02:08.618 --> 02:11.018
They wanted a whole area for the exclusive use

02:11.019 --> 02:13.719
of skullduggery open.

02:13.920 --> 02:18.620
The Almighty will consider that if Daniele has made mistakes,

02:20.021 --> 02:24.221
errors have been committed by a boy of 16.

02:26.022 --> 02:30.922
A boy who was certainly responsible for what he did.

02:32.523 --> 02:35.123
But 16 ...

02:37.124 --> 02:40.624
16 are so few

02:41.725 --> 02:45.625
they force you to look better what is behind,

02:47.426 --> 02:52.726
force you to apportion liability.

02:52.727 --> 02:57.927
The Daniele is an age that calls awareness of who chatters

02:58.928 --> 03:02.128
legality, dedication, work,

03:02.629 --> 03:05.329
not called knuckles,

03:07.230 --> 03:09.830
but fingernails.

03:10.731 --> 03:12.831
Standing.

03:51.332 --> 03:54.332
And that friend of his, Bruno, nothing is known?

03:54.333 --> 03:59.833
It has disappeared, say it is in Marseille, has family there.

03:59.934 --> 04:02.334
We can get to him.

04:02.735 --> 04:05.435
We can not ride more fuss,

04:05.436 --> 04:08.536
if I knew anything, I would have spoken.

04:08.537 --> 04:11.737
For now, let someone at your home.

04:12.438 --> 04:15.638
- Guys, who's in charge here? - Us!

04:21.539 --> 04:24.239
Massimo?, Daniele's brother?

04:24.240 --> 04:26.340
It is not known anything about him.

04:26.341 --> 04:30.841
We looked everywhere, no one knows what happened to him.

05:04.542 --> 05:07.442
We know who killed Danielino.

05:07.443 --> 05:11.343
- Yes, but do not know why. - Baroncino, I do not give a shit why.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.044
Salvatore Conte would not have dared.

05:13.045 --> 05:16.645
This is my home, and Danielino was our problem.

05:16.646 --> 05:19.546
And Conte has given alike.

05:19.547 --> 05:22.147
Ese imbecile is challenging to all.

05:22.148 --> 05:26.148
But what are you saying, what are you saying?

05:26.149 --> 05:30.049
Since Cyrus went to Spain, we are doing good business with Conte,

05:30.050 --> 05:33.050
but very good business, and if Conte is back

05:33.051 --> 05:35.451
is only because they killed Russo, period.

05:35.452 --> 05:37.352
Why this idiot still here?

05:37.353 --> 05:41.553
And why promises the moon and the stars who happens to him?

05:49.554 --> 05:52.554
Be cut with Conte.

05:53.555 --> 05:57.255
From today, no longer sell your hashish.

05:58.256 --> 06:02.256
But some reasons, Genny. Reason.

06:02.257 --> 06:04.957
So we were wrong.

06:04.958 --> 06:07.758
And what this Chavalillo

06:07.759 --> 06:10.759
is gossip, gossip housewife.

06:10.760 --> 06:14.460
I'm sure Conte did not want to disrespect anyone,

06:14.461 --> 06:17.261
and perhaps did not know who was Danielino.

06:17.262 --> 06:19.462
Salvatore Conte knew who was Danielino,

06:19.463 --> 06:23.163
but above all this I knew I was taking it personally.

06:23.164 --> 06:26.364
I do not give my money to people who want to start a war.

06:26.365 --> 06:30.165
Genna, there is only one thing you should not forget:

06:30.166 --> 06:33.866
We built this house with your father,

06:33.867 --> 06:38.667
and have always respected one rule:

06:38.668 --> 06:42.268
money has no flag.

06:42.269 --> 06:46.669
And here we are talking about money, money, period.

06:48.970 --> 06:53.570
The problem is not Conte.

07:21.171 --> 07:24.071
We'll see, Genna. Chao, chavales.

07:29.172 --> 07:33.172
Chao, Genn. Tonino, we see at home.

07:39.973 --> 07:42.973
Zecchinetta have bad character.

07:44.874 --> 07:47.574
He has never talked like Don Pietro,

07:48.675 --> 07:51.275
and also in front of everyone ...

07:51.476 --> 07:53.976
Are we crazy?

07:54.877 --> 07:57.277
But it is not silly.

07:58.578 --> 08:02.378
He has cast the line, you know you are in a money game.

08:02.379 --> 08:04.979
Some fish girl.

08:05.380 --> 08:09.980
And Conte ... What follows here, has not returned to Spain.

08:10.281 --> 08:13.081
I think it has something in mind.

08:13.782 --> 08:16.282
Chao, Gennà.

08:23.883 --> 08:26.583
Ciro's right.

08:26.584 --> 08:30.184
Makes more money dead than guns.

08:41.284 --> 08:44.485
I did not like how he talked Zecchinetta.

08:45.186 --> 08:48.186
I should not have dared.

08:50.387 --> 08:54.487
But mostly I did not like how he heard the old.

09:01.488 --> 09:04.888
You have to eat the tongue,

09:06.989 --> 09:10.889
but first you have to do to tell you where it's hidden Conte.

09:33.890 --> 09:37.190
¡Agostino, guapo!

09:39.691 --> 09:43.891
- Where is Dad? Are you at home? - Yeah, I'm gonna call?

09:43.892 --> 09:46.392
Do not worry, we climbed.

09:51.593 --> 09:54.793
Hey, kiddies, what are you doing, eh?

09:54.794 --> 09:56.894
- We're playing. - With pistols.

09:56.895 --> 09:59.595
Expected that I teach yo something beautiful.

09:59.596 --> 10:01.996
Did you see?? Wait ...

10:01.997 --> 10:04.897
And while it has found a device

10:04.898 --> 10:09.598
Room of the President of the regional board of Campania.

10:22.299 --> 10:24.999
Agostino, the keys!

10:25.000 --> 10:27.300
Always the same!

10:33.001 --> 10:36.201
Agostino, see if you grab keys.

10:36.402 --> 10:41.902
- But what? Are you crazy? - We come from Genny.

10:41.903 --> 10:44.903
- Wait, wait. - How beautiful! -Wait. Ten.

10:44.904 --> 10:47.504
Hey, what are you teaching these kids?

10:47.505 --> 10:50.305
- How beautiful, I want one. - You also want?

10:50.306 --> 10:53.106
Shot. Wait!

10:53.107 --> 10:54.907
- Wait. - You want to be a cop?

10:54.908 --> 10:57.308
You, take. But what do you know shoot?

10:57.309 --> 10:59.509
- Yes - there Shoot, shoot.

11:00.810 --> 11:04.110
- It's beautiful! But you are friends dad, right? Sure.

11:04.111 --> 11:08.211
We know him since we were your age. Shoot, shoot.

11:11.012 --> 11:13.212
I am the godfather Genny confirmation.

11:13.213 --> 11:15.913
I can not believe that you have sent him.

11:15.914 --> 11:19.314
Well it is. Gennarino are you up to the hilt.

11:19.315 --> 11:22.915
- I have my children down. Do not worry, you take care of them we us.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.116
You just tell us where the shit lies Conte.

11:25.317 --> 11:28.517
I do not know. I do not know.

11:28.918 --> 11:31.218
¡No te creo!

11:32.519 --> 11:34.019
Yo no te creo.

11:34.020 --> 11:36.820
I do not know where he is or want to know!

11:36.821 --> 11:39.821
Bastard! You've already spent with Conte.

11:39.822 --> 11:41.922
You've already spent with Conte.

11:59.523 --> 12:02.323
When we get him out him and his minions shits,

12:02.324 --> 12:06.924
we have to divide up the territory, and make a pact for the future.

12:06.925 --> 12:09.125
Anyone who has been kicked out from the clan must return Savastano

12:09.126 --> 12:11.426
and there shall be no more problems.

12:11.427 --> 12:14.127
The "squares" have to be everyone and no one,

12:14.128 --> 12:19.128
one has to have a monopoly on anything.

12:25.529 --> 12:29.529
Each channel can be served as you like without paying intermediaries.

12:29.530 --> 12:32.230
Private vendettas and business are separate from

12:32.231 --> 12:35.731
because businesses are always the most important.

12:39.532 --> 12:42.332
I do not ask anyone to betray anyone.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.433
Only I ask you cojáis what was already yours,

12:49.634 --> 12:53.534
as I take what was already mine.

12:55.535 --> 13:00.135
I was born here, as you all.

13:27.736 --> 13:33.336
Guys, here have all gone mad. Do you realize? My nephew!

13:33.337 --> 13:36.037
La sangre de mi sangre has matado to Zecchinetta.

13:36.038 --> 13:40.138
I can not think about it. I raised him like a son, now what do I do, eh?

13:40.340 --> 13:44.040
We can not leave the clan in the hands of Genny and Chavalillos.

13:44.241 --> 13:47.441
We have to do something for the good of all.

13:47.442 --> 13:49.642
We belong to clan always Savastano.

13:49.643 --> 13:52.443
Don Pietro has been like a father to me,

13:52.444 --> 13:57.244
And ... I think this is worth us all. - Peter Savastano, yes.

13:57.245 --> 14:01.145
But his son and Chavalillos are another matter.

14:02.946 --> 14:08.546
They do not think in business, they have no respect, they have a head full of shit.

14:09.347 --> 14:13.547
If we have to make war, we have to think which side we want to be.

14:13.548 --> 14:17.848
My brother and I are ready to do anything,

14:19.649 --> 14:22.749
Happen ... even with Conte. - No, IMs.

14:22.950 --> 14:27.450
We have to stick together, now we have to keep everyone together.

14:29.351 --> 14:32.451
Oh Cyrus tú've seen grow Gennaro,

14:32.452 --> 14:35.852
and perhaps the only reason that can make you are.

14:35.953 --> 14:38.253
Talk to him!

14:42.954 --> 14:45.354
I can try.

14:46.155 --> 14:48.755
But Carlucciello,

14:48.956 --> 14:51.756
you also have to do something.

14:54.857 --> 14:56.757
Oh, Ciro...

14:58.158 --> 15:02.558
You talk to Genny, my nephew that I got it.

15:17.459 --> 15:21.159
Boy ... Come here, we need to talk.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.560
- What happened, man? - Come on, hurry.

15:24.161 --> 15:26.861
To see me enter, Tonino, what if coño will put in his head?

15:26.862 --> 15:28.862
What are you talking about? I do not understand!

15:28.863 --> 15:31.863
Boy, do not play dumb with me. I'm the one who brought you; what you do

15:31.864 --> 15:35.264
you like it in, I just enterando that you are in oblivion.

15:35.265 --> 15:37.365
We did what we had to do.

15:37.366 --> 15:40.366
- Genny commanded us. - Genny is a poop.

15:40.367 --> 15:44.067
A people who make you money is not killed, they purchase.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.568
A Zecchinetta everyone wanted much.

15:46.569 --> 15:48.469
Why has continued doing business with Conte?

15:48.470 --> 15:50.470
But who cares who wanted to do business with?

15:50.471 --> 15:52.471
Zecchinetta was one of us, you understand or not?

15:52.472 --> 15:55.072
And do you understand that now we are available to us?

15:55.073 --> 15:56.873
You there quiet and do not move.

15:56.874 --> 16:00.374
Chavales, tú in you dare, ¿understood?

16:00.375 --> 16:03.075
You and this bunch of wimps, your peers,

16:03.076 --> 16:05.576
you have to learn to respect people who are older

16:05.577 --> 16:08.277
and more experienced than you, okay?

16:08.278 --> 16:11.178
- You who do not understand. - Put that down, you idiot.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.979
You who do not understand shit.

16:12.980 --> 16:17.080
You are like cars that no longer work. Now you just go to the hole.

16:19.181 --> 16:21.881
Well shoot, to see how much you man.

16:21.882 --> 16:26.582
If you kill me, you kill yourself, asshole.

16:26.583 --> 16:29.683
Hey, but what are you doing?

16:29.884 --> 16:33.484
Have you gone mad? It's your uncle.

16:34.185 --> 16:36.385
Put the gun down.

16:38.586 --> 16:40.886
Pop, to stick to the motto.

17:00.087 --> 17:03.287
Venga, vámonos in the past nothing will.

17:03.288 --> 17:06.288
The death of Zecchinetta discovered letters.

17:06.989 --> 17:12.789
The oldest of the "paranza" have met with Salvatore Conte.

17:16.490 --> 17:20.190
They have said they want all go to the other side,

17:23.590 --> 17:27.790
because they say to you, to you ...

17:28.192 --> 17:30.992
no longer trust,

17:31.193 --> 17:34.193
because you have never had respect.

17:34.294 --> 17:36.294
Do you seriously going to do?

17:36.295 --> 17:38.495
They want to betray you and your father, these infamous.

17:38.496 --> 17:43.296
As we did with Zecchinetta well have to do with everyone.

17:43.297 --> 17:47.097
Trak's right, we have to kill them all,

17:47.098 --> 17:49.198
although we doubt at all.

17:52.399 --> 17:55.199
Zecchinetta died because he was wrong.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.600
So far no one else has to die.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.301
Tomorrow I'll go talk to my father

18:08.402 --> 18:12.502
and when I come back, no longer speak of Salvatore Conte

18:12.503 --> 18:15.003
a don Pietro Savastano,

18:15.004 --> 18:20.304
because not only here, but all we are his children.

19:04.605 --> 19:07.205
Dad, how are you?

19:19.006 --> 19:21.506
Our friend has returned from Spain

19:21.507 --> 19:25.007
and want to make the party the same day as us.

19:25.008 --> 19:28.908
We are worried, dad, because many of our friends

19:28.909 --> 19:32.709
want to go to your party and not come to ours.

19:38.310 --> 19:41.210
Dad, you have to talk to our relatives,

19:41.211 --> 19:44.711
because if not, someone will end badly.

19:47.312 --> 19:51.312
Dad, I do not know who I can trust me, do you understand?

20:42.113 --> 20:44.013
You had to have seen it.

20:44.014 --> 20:46.314
I gave him just enough time to look into my eyes

20:46.315 --> 20:49.415
and boom, he blew his brains out.

20:49.416 --> 20:53.916
Trak's right, it's best to shoot in the head, they die quickly.

20:53.917 --> 20:55.917
Why, in the face right?

20:55.918 --> 21:00.318
- O front or rear is the same. - But what are you saying?

21:00.319 --> 21:04.819
You do not know shit! You have to shoot the chest.

21:04.820 --> 21:08.320
A couple of shots to the chest and died immediately.

21:08.521 --> 21:12.721
- But what mierdas reliable ... - Slow down, moron.

21:12.722 --> 21:15.922
- What do you want? - Quiet.

21:16.023 --> 21:18.523
Remember what Genny said,

21:18.524 --> 21:21.124
armemos no hassles until he returns.

21:21.125 --> 21:23.125
Roger that??

21:23.426 --> 21:28.026
Now is the "killer" ... you be the "boss"!

21:28.827 --> 21:33.027
Al? Chest? Chest dies at 10 minutes.

21:33.328 --> 21:35.928
First you have to fill the lungs with blood.

21:35.929 --> 21:39.629
Pain, you meas above.

21:40.230 --> 21:43.830
- Damn, I'm eating. - I had forgotten ...

21:43.831 --> 21:46.531
The girl is nervous.

21:46.532 --> 21:51.232
Did you know? Miss Here is afraid of his Tiito.

21:51.233 --> 21:54.033
Have a problem?

21:54.034 --> 21:57.734
You're the problem, Tonino. You're the problem!

21:57.735 --> 22:00.535
¿In the tadpole see that you are?

22:00.536 --> 22:03.636
Lads, do not you you smell like shit?

22:04.937 --> 22:08.637
Asshole, I have no fear of anyone.

22:09.338 --> 22:11.238
And now I'll show you.

22:11.239 --> 22:13.239
The account!

22:13.240 --> 22:15.140
What are you doing with your hand?

22:15.141 --> 22:18.941
- Sending a message. - To whom? -A friend.

22:18.942 --> 22:21.042
Always with the phone in hand!

22:22.643 --> 22:26.343
- That's Mom. - Come, little one.

22:32.844 --> 22:36.744
Tonino am, I have a message from Genny.

22:41.345 --> 22:43.145
- Come on then, upload. - No, I can not.

22:43.146 --> 22:46.146
I have some errands to run. Lower you.

22:51.947 --> 22:53.847
So what, low or not?

22:53.848 --> 22:56.848
No, I can not get down, get thee, go.

23:04.649 --> 23:07.149
You are not alone, Dad.

23:22.150 --> 23:25.650
We have seen. Let's go.

23:26.651 --> 23:28.251
Good, but has shit.

23:28.252 --> 23:30.652
- What is going to shit! - Have you ever fucked?

23:30.653 --> 23:34.953
- Let's go, come back tomorrow. - Of course.

23:47.054 --> 23:49.654
They are gone, Dad.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.555
I want to see if it goes, this bastard.

24:17.556 --> 24:20.156
- There. - You have to put two.

24:20.157 --> 24:22.557
- Check this out. - Come on, another.

24:23.858 --> 24:26.058
Finch! Finch!

24:26.059 --> 24:28.459
Bastard!

24:31.560 --> 24:33.960
But what is this mess?

24:33.961 --> 24:36.961
Can I touch you come to hell down here at this hour?

24:36.962 --> 24:39.362
But what are you doing? What is that??

24:39.363 --> 24:42.363
- John ¡! - ¡Oh, he llamado John!

24:42.364 --> 24:46.964
Hey, is falling, is falling. Hurry, hurry!

24:51.765 --> 24:52.965
Bastard!

24:52.966 --> 24:55.266
Enclosed you must be like a monkey!

24:55.667 --> 24:58.467
- Bastard. - You are four sons of bitches!

24:58.468 --> 25:00.368
You will be fool, I'm calling your uncle!

25:01.369 --> 25:04.569
Unfortunate, you're just a brat! Moron!

25:04.570 --> 25:06.970
These motherfuckers.

25:08.371 --> 25:11.471
Unfortunate because'll get you in bed, you idiot!

25:11.472 --> 25:15.072
Giovanni! These four sons of bitches ...

25:15.073 --> 25:19.573
Mira, but aims. ¡John, baja!

25:23.174 --> 25:26.274
Unfortunate, the portal is closed! Moron.

25:53.675 --> 25:56.775
- Baroncino! - Bastard!

25:56.776 --> 26:00.576
- Asómate, scum! - The sheet!

26:01.577 --> 26:03.977
- ¡Cornudo! - ¡Asómate!

26:03.978 --> 26:05.578
Shoot, shoot!

26:12.379 --> 26:14.979
'Te're shitting up, Baroncino!

26:15.580 --> 26:19.280
- Bastard! - You've Shit Up!

26:20.781 --> 26:23.581
- Venga, come on. - Vámonos.

28:03.282 --> 28:06.282
- Hi there. - Hi, Mom.

28:07.483 --> 28:10.183
Dad is not right in the head.

28:12.184 --> 28:14.384
He has not said a word.

28:14.385 --> 28:17.785
I think you are swelling to psychotropic

28:18.486 --> 28:20.886
It's not him.

28:53.887 --> 28:57.487
That your father did not have to know anyone.

28:58.188 --> 29:00.588
Understood, Genna?

29:00.889 --> 29:05.589
No one. For once in life, listen.

29:10.490 --> 29:14.390
Have to say that your father has told you to seek peace.

29:14.991 --> 29:18.091
To admit your mistakes and forgive.

29:18.392 --> 29:20.892
Forgive what?

29:21.793 --> 29:26.293
Tonight idiots of your friends have been an earthquake in Naples.

29:27.294 --> 29:31.094
And tonight the old Tonino have killed Spiderman.

29:35.195 --> 29:40.595
You call a meeting tomorrow. There is much tension in the air.

29:41.896 --> 29:44.696
It has to be a meeting with relatives as collateral.

29:44.697 --> 29:46.997
Everyone has to leave a family in the hands of another.

29:46.998 --> 29:50.598
Only then can you be sure you do not go to the play.

31:27.099 --> 31:29.999
Yesterday I was with my father in the jail of shit

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
and spoke with his heart in his hand.

31:34.201 --> 31:37.501
It made me truly understand who we are

31:38.802 --> 31:42.502
made me realize that this

31:42.803 --> 31:49.403
and this other side, we are all friends, family, brothers.

31:50.904 --> 31:52.704
Yes, I was wrong.

31:52.705 --> 31:56.205
Moreover, my friends and I have been wrong,

31:57.606 --> 32:01.006
because we have acted without thinking

32:01.807 --> 32:04.807
and we forget what is most important.

32:07.508 --> 32:10.008
Respect.

32:12.809 --> 32:16.409
I do not forget the blood of Zecchinetta,

32:16.710 --> 32:20.510
nor forget the blood of Tonino Spiderman.

32:21.311 --> 32:24.011
But this string of deaths has to end,

32:24.012 --> 32:26.712
because we have to be united against Salvatore Conte.

32:26.713 --> 32:29.413
You must return to Spain,

32:31.614 --> 32:34.414
because here the ground sends a clan,

32:34.915 --> 32:38.515
and that clan is all of us.

33:45.416 --> 33:48.516
- Who is it? - Doña Imma.

34:03.317 --> 34:05.917
- Good night, go ahead. - Good night.

34:07.718 --> 34:11.818
- Excuse me. - Good night.

34:14.319 --> 34:18.219
Bruno was afraid, so I said nothing.

34:19.920 --> 34:24.719
And then, when he learned of the death and funeral Danielino,

34:24.721 --> 34:27.221
sent me this.

34:27.621 --> 34:32.522
It is a message. Bruno found it in the mailbox of the mobile phone.

34:49.223 --> 34:51.623
Phone mailbox.

34:53.123 --> 34:58.524
Bruno, I am Manu's girlfriend Daniele. I'm still here waiting.

34:59.625 --> 35:03.925
- Already Manu's girlfriend Daniele? - Are you Bruno, his friend?

35:04.026 --> 35:05.526
Come up.

35:09.027 --> 35:11.227
What happened to Daniele? Where is?

35:11.228 --> 35:13.028
That you have to tell me you me.

35:13.029 --> 35:17.529
- You're not Bruno! - You're beautiful, and intelligent.

35:17.530 --> 35:18.930
- Let me down! - Where are you going?

35:18.931 --> 35:21.531
- Let me down! - Where the hell Daniele?

35:21.532 --> 35:23.732
- Let me down! - Be sure how you talk, eh!

35:23.733 --> 35:26.633
Where is Daniele pussy? Where is?

35:32.634 --> 35:34.134
We can no longer trust him to us.

35:34.135 --> 35:37.435
He said what he said just to buy time.

35:37.436 --> 35:40.036
I agree with my brother.

35:40.037 --> 35:44.637
Have you seen it? How we looked there.

35:44.638 --> 35:48.838
We must speak with Conte, and we must do it now.

35:50.239 --> 35:54.939
Because only with your help we can make war on Genny.

35:56.040 --> 35:59.740
I think if we can avoid this war is best avoided.

35:59.741 --> 36:03.341
Dead to mourn those we have enough.

36:04.042 --> 36:07.442
And you, Cyrus? What do you say??

36:07.443 --> 36:10.643
¿Do you think we Aun fiarnos?

36:10.644 --> 36:14.644
I have done everything possible to keep joined this clan.

36:18.245 --> 36:21.545
Now I think we have to do a split.

36:22.846 --> 36:25.746
Gypsy is right.

36:26.447 --> 36:30.947
Tonight Gennaro Savastano has done a good performance.

36:32.048 --> 36:35.448
We have to offer our partnership to Conte.

36:35.449 --> 36:38.449
We must make war on Gennaro,

36:38.750 --> 36:41.850
before he makes us us.

36:42.751 --> 36:44.851
Pensadlo.

37:09.552 --> 37:14.052
- What's up? Nano-Era. There is a problem with Dona Imma.

37:28.752 --> 37:31.752
This is a copy of the recording.

37:33.353 --> 37:36.853
- Tomorrow, around wake up, you do me a favor. -Tell me.

37:36.954 --> 37:41.454
You have to go see my lawyer. Then call him and tell him what to do

37:41.455 --> 37:48.055
... If anything happens to me. - Why? What will you do?

37:48.656 --> 37:53.156
I'll go talk to him. I have to save my son's life.

37:53.157 --> 37:58.057
Do not understand how to go and see and look into his eyes.

37:58.058 --> 38:01.758
I see when I look at Ciro a dead man.

38:01.759 --> 38:04.859
And I see my son alive at his funeral giving a nice speech

38:04.860 --> 38:08.460
before all the lords of our family.

38:11.261 --> 38:14.261
War, Marina, is not to the strong,

38:14.262 --> 38:17.562
the best wins waits.

38:17.563 --> 38:21.863
And nobody knows that better than we do women.

39:02.564 --> 39:04.464
Say.

39:04.565 --> 39:06.565
Good morning, Ciro.

39:06.566 --> 39:09.566
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, but I have to talk to you urgently.

39:09.567 --> 39:11.767
Can we meet?

39:11.768 --> 39:13.768
No problem, Mrs. Imma.

39:13.769 --> 39:17.169
You know, always has known.

39:18.570 --> 39:21.570
For what it is, I am at your disposal.

39:23.671 --> 39:26.971
- See you later. - Okay.

39:35.572 --> 39:38.872
¡Maria Rita! ¡Vámonos, anda!

39:45.173 --> 39:49.773
- Already Manu's girlfriend Daniele? - Are you Bruno, his friend?

39:49.774 --> 39:51.374
Come up.

39:54.975 --> 39:57.275
What happened to Daniele? Where is?

39:57.276 --> 39:59.876
That you have to tell me you me.

39:59.976 --> 40:06.376
- You're not Bruno! - You're beautiful, and intelligent.

40:06.577 --> 40:07.677
- Let me down! - Where are you going?

40:07.678 --> 40:10.178
- Let me down! - Where the hell Daniele?

40:10.179 --> 40:12.879
- Let me down! - Be sure how you talk, eh!

40:12.880 --> 40:16.580
Where is Daniele pussy? Where is?

40:19.181 --> 40:22.581
You killed a girl of 15 years,

40:22.682 --> 40:25.982
and betrayed everyone.

40:26.383 --> 40:30.583
These are things no one can forgive you.

40:35.984 --> 40:38.984
But I want Genny never know,

40:38.985 --> 40:42.085
neither he nor anyone.

40:42.086 --> 40:45.886
But you have to do what I say.

40:47.187 --> 40:49.187
You have to call Conte

40:49.188 --> 40:51.988
and say you want to ally with him and all the old clan

40:51.989 --> 40:54.489
are willing to follow you, you have to reunite

40:54.490 --> 40:58.290
because you have to decide how to get Genny and all his friends.

40:58.291 --> 41:01.291
An ambush.

41:01.492 --> 41:05.192
That's all you can do to keep the peace.

41:05.193 --> 41:09.793
- Conte has died. - And then?

41:11.494 --> 41:13.894
Y luego te vas.

41:13.895 --> 41:19.995
You, your daughter, your wife, you disappear never to return.

41:20.296 --> 41:24.896
And who says I will not kill you now and here?

41:26.097 --> 41:28.697
If anything happens to me,

41:28.698 --> 41:33.598
my lawyer will give Genny a CD with this recording.

41:34.199 --> 41:38.199
Then everyone will know that you are infamous.

41:41.900 --> 41:45.800
I always knew I could not trust you.

41:47.201 --> 41:50.401
You will read in his eyes.

41:51.102 --> 41:54.502
You have no feelings.

41:56.503 --> 41:59.003
Not true.

42:01.604 --> 42:05.204
To survive I've clung to a feeling,

42:06.305 --> 42:09.205
to one:

42:10.906 --> 42:14.606
you've always hated.

42:30.507 --> 42:33.207
Do what I said,

42:35.008 --> 42:37.608
if you want to save your life.

44:54.009 --> 44:55.809
Yup??

44:56.410 --> 44:58.510
Well?

45:00.511 --> 45:04.411
All right. Very well.

45:04.412 --> 45:07.112
You did very well.

45:08.513 --> 45:15.113
That's fine. See you. Chao.

45:41.814 --> 45:44.614
We want a meeting.

45:45.815 --> 45:51.515
- Gennaro Savastano What does it say? - What does that mean? Nothing.

45:52.216 --> 45:56.216
The Savastano represent the past.
