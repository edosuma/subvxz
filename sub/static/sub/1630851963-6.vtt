00:31.000 --> 00:33.280
You may find this
hard to believe,

00:33.320 --> 00:35.000
but I don't want
to make you suffer.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.400
That would objectify
both of us.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.200
I'm just going to nip
and get a bucket.

01:09.680 --> 01:10.880
Everything ok, love?

01:10.920 --> 01:12.560
You probably don't want
to chat, do you?

01:12.600 --> 01:13.880
Mind on higher things...

01:13.920 --> 01:15.960
I don't know
what you're so happy about.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.760
It's going to be a kick bollock
scramble to do the girl
before they come looking.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.320
Hun, if anyone can do it,
you can.

01:21.360 --> 01:23.120
She's not on the list.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.640
I don't want people
to lose sight of the point
I'm trying to make.

01:27.680 --> 01:32.360
If I kill the girl,
it's going to look overzealous,
gratuitous.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.160
Are you going to get that?

01:40.520 --> 01:41.520
Oh.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.520
Leave it.
You're more important.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.680
Oh, let's go away tonight?

01:46.720 --> 01:49.160
The passports are ready,
the bags are packed.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.800
Babe, what if Caesar
never crossed the Rubicon?

01:52.840 --> 01:56.320
You can stand there
asking "What if?" all night,
but the fact is...

01:57.280 --> 01:58.400
...you've got a destiny.

01:59.280 --> 02:02.360
And remember, you're not broken,

02:03.720 --> 02:05.720
God's making stained glass.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.200
I know what
I'm going to do to her.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.400
Oh, don't tell me,
don't tell me.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.640
I want to read about it
on the Internet,
when they find her!

02:23.600 --> 02:27.360

searched the location, ma'am.</i>

03:36.280 --> 03:37.320
Received.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.920
Local cops
are ten minutes out.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.240
We're a half hour away.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.880
I told her to wait for me!
No one listens!

03:43.920 --> 03:45.760
- Step on it! Pick it up!
I'm trying.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.200
Hmm.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.480
For goodness' sake...

04:44.400 --> 04:46.640
<i>DC Lake Edmunds was last seen
at your location,</i>

04:46.680 --> 04:48.120
<i>search the premises. Over.</i>

04:48.160 --> 04:49.480
I'll check the basement.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.320
Tea? Coffee? Drinky-poo?

04:52.360 --> 04:55.080
- A cheeky little paddle up
Jacob's Creek?
- No, thank you, madam.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.920
Oh, let me do that.
There's a knack.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.680
Watch you don't
break your neck.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.680
What's in here?

05:43.520 --> 05:45.080
Thank you for your time,
Mrs. Massey.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.120
Thick walls.

06:09.560 --> 06:12.560
That was Vicky Tibbs from 26
asking for a mop and bleach.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.400
The things she'll stomach
to please Kevin.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.200
I need you to buy me some lye.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.400
The builders' merchants
on the ring road,
it should still be open.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.920
You always cut it too fine,
it's like you and petrol.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.480
I'm gonna have
to unblock the drains.
There is a fatberg forming.

06:23.520 --> 06:26.200
That's because you started
flushing bodies
out of bone idleness.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.720
That's how they caught
Dennis Nilsen.

06:27.760 --> 06:34.520
Don't... ever compare me
to Nilsen,

06:34.560 --> 06:38.160
Bundy, Dahmer, perverts, scum.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.200
It makes you sound
like an idiot.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.640
I'm sorry, Tommy.

06:41.680 --> 06:45.200
I'm not doing this
because it feels good.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.480
Life is nasty,
brutish and short,

06:47.520 --> 06:49.440
yes, and people
used to understand that.

06:49.480 --> 06:54.000
And then some genius decides
that we all deserve to live
without fear.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.760
And bang goes truth,

06:55.800 --> 06:57.880
bang goes justice!

06:57.920 --> 06:59.800
Because fear
is necessary, Joy.

07:00.760 --> 07:03.440
What I am doing is necessary.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.400
Yeah.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.840
God!

07:15.560 --> 07:19.040
Local cops say they saw
no evidence of DC Edmunds
at the property.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.840
That's them now. Should we...
- Keep driving.

07:37.280 --> 07:42.320
Traitors were hanged, drawn
and quartered throughout
the "Enlightenment."

07:42.360 --> 07:43.520
Police!

07:45.040 --> 07:47.280
The condemned man
would be drawn,

07:47.320 --> 07:50.800
he would have
his intestines removed
and burnt in front of him.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.080
Help me!

07:55.120 --> 07:56.840
Anything?
No one's upstairs.

07:59.800 --> 08:00.800
The basement.

08:04.600 --> 08:05.920
Let me have the torch.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.600
Is there anything?

08:11.640 --> 08:13.000
Nothing in here, ma'am.

08:19.520 --> 08:22.120
The basement
feels too small for this house.

08:24.120 --> 08:28.520
Now the executioner made
incisions in the tendons
around the arms and the legs,

08:28.560 --> 08:30.200
so that when
the horses started pulling,

08:30.240 --> 08:33.320
the limbs would come away
from the torso or "trunk."

08:37.160 --> 08:39.000
It's a door. She's in here!

08:50.160 --> 08:52.320
Push it,
it's spring loaded.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.760
Edmunds?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.960
- Edmunds!

09:22.320 --> 09:23.640
Baxter, help...

09:24.520 --> 09:25.480
It's all right.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.920
Hey, hey, it's okay.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.520
Are you all right?

10:00.680 --> 10:01.640
Are you all right?

10:02.520 --> 10:03.560
You all right there?

10:03.600 --> 10:04.600
You all right, madam?

10:34.320 --> 10:35.840
"Powerlessness."

11:42.080 --> 11:43.800
<i>I was thinking
about the trial...</i>

11:45.960 --> 11:47.320
...and I realized
you weren't there.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.000
I couldn't handle it.
You scared me,

11:49.040 --> 11:50.320
I didn't recognize you.

14:02.520 --> 14:03.800
For the benefit
of the tape,

14:03.840 --> 14:06.240
I'm showing Joy Massey
11 Polaroids,

14:06.280 --> 14:08.040
each with a handwritten date,

14:08.080 --> 14:10.320
sent to the same P.O. box
in Palmers Green

14:10.360 --> 14:11.800
over a period of four years.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.720
It gave me a feeling of control.

14:16.760 --> 14:19.520
I couldn't keep them at home
and they had to be Polaroids,

14:19.560 --> 14:21.360
'cause Thomas used
to go through my phone.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.880
He was jealous?

14:22.920 --> 14:24.240
He was old-fashioned.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.920
Some of these photos,
they're pretty nasty.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.280
Do you have any scars?

14:35.520 --> 14:37.800
Thomas was a prison nurse,
you know that.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.920
Flesh wounds
were his bread and butter.

14:39.960 --> 14:43.480
He blackmailed one
of his victims, Alyssa Airley,
by kidnapping her son, Daniel.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.640
Daniel remembers
human remains in the car

14:46.680 --> 14:49.400
in which he was abducted,
wounded faces.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.960
He also remembers
smelling acetone,

14:52.000 --> 14:55.200
which make up artists
like yourself use to remove
silicone off skin.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.200
Are you asking me
if I faked them?

14:57.240 --> 15:00.760
If you faked them as leverage
to get yourself out of an
abusive relationship,

15:00.800 --> 15:02.280
I'd understand.

15:02.320 --> 15:03.960
But if we can ID the car
in which Daniel was abducted,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.680
that'd be a start.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.160
I think there's a special place
in hell for women like you.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.280
Hmm.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.880
The patch
on Andrea Wyld's body,

15:14.920 --> 15:16.920
it matched her skin perfectly.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.440
I had files on all my regulars
at home.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.640
And Thomas was an inventor.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.360
He could turn his hand
to anything.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.560
You sound like
you're proud of him.

15:27.280 --> 15:28.760
I am.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.760
But the man I loved
died last night.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.200
<i>She's got an alibi
for every kill.</i>

16:21.240 --> 16:24.520
There's no physical evidence
to suggest that Joy took part
in any of the violence.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.520
No cameras, peepholes,
she's not a voyeur.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.160
For the gnarly bit,
she was off in the chip shop.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.800
Let's go with
what she said.

16:29.840 --> 16:32.560
Not once did Joy ever deny
that her husband was the killer.

16:32.600 --> 16:36.240
The Polaroids are proof that
Massey was violent and abusive.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.840
And you won't
get a jury saying otherwise.

16:38.880 --> 16:43.200
I mean, I'm sorry, but what does
a woman have to do
to be believed around here?

16:43.240 --> 16:46.400
She's cooperated with us fully.
We can't hold her forever.

16:46.440 --> 16:50.120
Ma'am, Thomas Massey
is a sociopath
with nothing to lose.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.280
And his wife is our best shot
at finding him.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.920
We've got officers
at every airport, ferry port,
train station.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.520
It's only a matter of time.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.880
Massey had his chance to run.
He didn't take it, nor did Rose.

16:59.920 --> 17:03.080
Instead, Rose is seen
in possession of a firearm
trying to break into my house.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.720
Where did he get a gun from?

17:04.760 --> 17:07.360
Anyone that does this job
properly knows
where to find a gun.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.440
Look, if we take Rose
off the board,

17:09.480 --> 17:12.600
then Massey loses
his primary motivation
to punish Rose.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.160
Then he'll have a heavy
incentive to leave the country,

17:15.200 --> 17:16.600
and we've got
all his exits covered.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.640
We're not going
to arrest Rose.

17:18.680 --> 17:22.160
Rose is guilty of aiding
and abetting the murder
of Mark Hooper

17:22.200 --> 17:23.840
and perverting
the course of justice.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.640
He confessed
all of this to me.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.360
Look, if this is
just about PR,

17:27.400 --> 17:29.560
then Rose' name
is the last on that list.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.920
If he dies, Massey wins.
How does that look?

17:31.960 --> 17:33.760
His death might not be
the worst outcome.

17:35.960 --> 17:39.240
Like you say, Massey's mission
would then be done.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.600
And I'm sure
we'd pick Massey up
very quickly.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.080
You literally
want to bury him.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.440
You're his friend.
Hand on heart,

17:46.480 --> 17:48.160
did you turn a blind eye
to his behavior?

17:50.120 --> 17:53.560
No one's doubting your ability.
You're destined
for great things.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.320
Sometimes we have
to bite our tongue.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.000
You're the face of this case.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.640
I need you calm and confident
on TV tonight.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.040
Don't throw it all away,
not for Rose.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.000
I could order some breakfast?

18:12.120 --> 18:13.120
Bagels?

18:13.880 --> 18:15.440
Get out.

18:15.480 --> 18:16.800
The thing is, it's my office.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.680
I'll give you a minute.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.400
<i>This is for Massey's residence
for outdoor surveillance.</i>

18:37.440 --> 18:39.680
<i>Forensic is still combining
the basement for prints.</i>

18:45.560 --> 18:48.600
<i>Now we do know that a woman in
her fifties is being questioned</i>

18:48.640 --> 18:51.080
<i>in connection
with the Ragdoll murders.</i>

18:51.120 --> 18:55.880
<i>Although, she wasn't arrested,
so she's presumably not being
seen as a suspect at this time.</i>

19:05.360 --> 19:06.520
How are you feeling?

19:06.560 --> 19:07.800
<i>Rose knows
about a mistake...</i>

19:07.840 --> 19:09.400
I made back in the States.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.640
He blackmailed me.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.240
<i>I gave him my pass,
that's how he escaped
from custody yesterday.</i>

19:15.280 --> 19:18.000
Oh, for God's sake, Christ,
please tell me
this is the morphine talking.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.840
If you want to charge me,
I get it.

19:19.880 --> 19:23.200
But the nurse just told me
that Rose is waiting
right outside my room.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.960
Keep him there.
Keep him talking.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.320
Sorry I put you
in a compromising situation
last night.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.360
Go to hell.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.240
I found an IED
at Baxter's house.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.520
Wait, you brought it
to a hospital?

19:40.560 --> 19:42.680
But I disassembled it first.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.280
I don't think it was supposed
to explode.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.440
I got some pretty
strong visuals

19:45.480 --> 19:47.000
from huffing
the canister.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.480
Oh, that sounds scientific.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.400
I think it might
be an aerosolized sedative,

19:50.440 --> 19:52.640
the same compound Massey
used on his patches.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.120
I mean the sensation
reminded me of...

19:55.160 --> 19:56.680
The night he killed
Andrea Wyld?

19:58.120 --> 19:59.400
Yeah.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.960
Baxter's not on the list,

20:02.000 --> 20:03.280
Massey won't want to kill her.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.000
- If he is using
the same sedative...
- Yeah.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.840
I think he wants
to use her as bait,

20:07.880 --> 20:10.200
make me come after him,
so he can get to me.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.520
What are you doing, Rose?

20:12.560 --> 20:15.000
You're a fugitive,
you're out of options.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.160
I got a hero's welcome
from the cop stationed outside.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.120
I'm probably not even flagged
on the PNC.

20:19.160 --> 20:22.400
I reckon they'll send Baxter
after me,

20:22.440 --> 20:24.320
they think I won't make a fuss.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.520
That's why you're here.
You knew I would call Baxter.
You wanted me to.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.400
Keep the bomb and, um...

20:32.560 --> 20:33.720
enjoy the grapes.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.400
Call me.

20:43.360 --> 20:46.640
Yeah, we found two severed heads
in Massey's basement.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.440
You should be in bed.

20:54.480 --> 20:57.160
Rose knew that I'd call you.
He wanted me to. I'm so sorry.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.400
What's that?

20:59.440 --> 21:04.360
That is an IED that Rose found
at your house this morning.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.600
It's the same design
as the one they found the day
Eric Turner died.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.680
Only Rose thinks it's armed
with a sedative,
not an explosive.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.960
Massey wants you alive
to use you as bait.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.000
Ma'am, did you find the light
in Massey's basement?

21:16.040 --> 21:17.440
The CSIs couldn't
find anything.

21:17.480 --> 21:18.920
Well, it's an orange light.

21:18.960 --> 21:21.480
And he stopped what he was doing
when he saw it flashing.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.000
Obviously his wife
was warning him
about the local cops.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.400
Did the light stop flashing?

21:26.400 --> 21:27.920
Yeah, after the cops left.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.280
So you heard them leaving?

21:30.320 --> 21:34.240
Did the light
start flashing again
when Finlay and I arrived?

21:34.280 --> 21:35.800
It's all right to say
"I don't know."

21:35.840 --> 21:37.640
No!

21:37.680 --> 21:39.800
No, it didn't.
But that is proof!

21:39.840 --> 21:43.280
Joy wasn't home when
you got there. So she couldn't
warn him about you.

21:43.320 --> 21:46.920
Lake, there is not one
of Joy Massey's fingerprints

21:46.960 --> 21:49.640
in the concealed section
of the basement.
Nothing, not even a hair.

21:49.680 --> 21:52.480
- She didn't even
touch the fake wall.
- Okay, but she knew!

21:52.520 --> 21:53.920
All right, she knew!

21:53.960 --> 21:55.280
I was the one being tortured.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.120
I don't understand
why nobody's listening to me!

22:00.800 --> 22:02.360
I believe you.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.000
But there's nothing I can do.

22:09.720 --> 22:10.840
Rose...

22:19.440 --> 22:20.600
You like it?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.000
I wanted something
with a tape deck.

22:22.040 --> 22:24.120
- Have you lost your mind?
- Cassettes are back.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.960
Nostalgia for
the unremembered '90s.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.640
You blackmail Edmunds,

22:27.680 --> 22:30.080
then you scare the shit
out of her to make me
drop everything,

22:30.120 --> 22:32.080
so that you can lure
Thomas Massey to a hospital?

22:32.120 --> 22:33.560
- I've got everything
under control.
- Yeah?

22:33.600 --> 22:35.280
You've got nothing
under control.
You're freewheeling,

22:35.320 --> 22:37.080
you're making the same mistakes
all over again!

22:37.120 --> 22:39.000
You made your deal with Massey

22:39.040 --> 22:41.280
because you couldn't believe
that we would ever catch
Hooper without you!

22:41.320 --> 22:43.080
Come on,
Hooper was in a tailspin.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.680
People are gonna die
because you're on some
death or glory bullshit!

22:45.720 --> 22:49.000
"Glory"? I'm driving
a diarrhea-colored
1993 Honda Civic...

22:49.040 --> 22:51.400
You know that
this is gonna jeopardize
the prosecution!

22:51.440 --> 22:54.600
Massey learnt everything
he knows about killing
inside the prison system.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.920
He's gonna spend
the rest of his life inside,

22:56.960 --> 22:59.280
telling anyone who'll listen
how to commit mass murder!

22:59.320 --> 23:01.920
What happens to him after
I arrest him isn't up to me!

23:01.960 --> 23:05.560
What's up to you is to see him
for who he'll always be.

23:05.600 --> 23:09.200
He's a human Chernobyl wearing
five-fingered shoe gloves,
for God's sake!

23:09.240 --> 23:10.760
You can't just
wash your hands of him!

23:12.200 --> 23:14.320
I don't get to choose
what's right and wrong.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.440
Look, I'm sorry
I put you in danger.

23:16.480 --> 23:17.920
Now get somewhere safe.
I'll sort this out.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.720
Rose, where are you going?
Where are you going?

23:19.760 --> 23:21.000
- Rose!
- To sort this out.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.280
Where are you going?

23:23.320 --> 23:25.440
Get out of the car, Bax.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.560
Tell me! What is wrong with you?
Why would you rather die
than tell me what's going on?

23:29.760 --> 23:31.920
It killed me to lie to you.

23:31.960 --> 23:33.400
But it felt like the only way

23:33.440 --> 23:35.160
to stop my world
going up in flames again.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.760
Listen to yourself,
that's your trauma talking.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.680
You need help, Nate.

23:38.720 --> 23:41.440
I should have listened to that.
I put my needs first.
I needed you.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.960
Let's get Massey together.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.360
You're not listening,
it's over.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.160
- He killed Joel.
He killed Andrea!
- Come in with me.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.280
Give me the keys!
Give me the gun!

23:55.240 --> 23:57.080
Tell me those are ambulances.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.480
- I called for backup.
They don't know the details yet.
- No!

24:04.200 --> 24:06.240
So you didn't give me
a chance.

24:06.280 --> 24:07.720
You didn't give me a chance!

24:11.520 --> 24:14.320
Rose, Vanita doesn't care
if you die!

24:14.360 --> 24:16.240
She wants you to die,

24:16.280 --> 24:18.400
to keep your deal with Massey
out of the papers.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.760
That's a good thing, Bax.
Don't you see?

24:20.800 --> 24:24.040
If I kill Massey, I'll be back
at my desk on Monday.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.880
Vanita doesn't have
to know anything.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.400
This could still be our secret.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.840
There is no "ours,"

24:32.880 --> 24:35.080
there's no "us."

24:35.120 --> 24:38.040
The truth, the truth
is the only thing
that will save you!

24:41.240 --> 24:42.800
Damn it! Fuck!

24:48.040 --> 24:49.440
I'm gonna kill him.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.520
It's all I'm good for.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.600
So give me the keys.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.960
Give me the keys!

25:11.440 --> 25:14.080
- I didn't want this.
- I don't care.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.240
He's such a shark.
I can't believe
this is happening to me.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.240
Jesus.

26:03.880 --> 26:06.560
<i>I knew you'd call.
Where's Baxter? Is she safe?</i>

26:06.600 --> 26:08.120
She gave me a ride
from the hospital.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.600
<i>Finlay's out of the ICU.</i>

26:09.640 --> 26:11.000
But that's not
why you're calling.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.680
<i>They let Joy Massey go.</i>

26:12.720 --> 26:16.080
They put her up in a motel
while the CSIs finish up
at her house.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.920
<i>I'll send you the address,
watch her,
see what she does next.</i>

26:18.960 --> 26:21.480
She's still our best shot
at catching Massey.

26:21.520 --> 26:24.280
<i>I've always said this was never
the work of just one man.</i>

26:24.320 --> 26:27.240
By the way,
you were right about the IED.
It was a sedative.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.480
Why are you helping me?

26:35.120 --> 26:36.760
All good with your make-up?

26:36.800 --> 26:39.160
We had to put an email out
for someone
to replace Joy Massey.

26:39.200 --> 26:44.360
In five, four,
three, two...

26:44.400 --> 26:47.560
I'm joined by Detective
Inspector Emily Baxter.

26:47.600 --> 26:52.080
Emily, are people dying due
to a lack of experience
at leadership level?

26:52.120 --> 26:53.920
I'm sorry?

26:53.960 --> 26:56.800
Well, have the police been
pressured into diversifying
too quickly?

26:56.840 --> 26:58.800
As you know, this is not what
I'm here to talk about.

26:58.840 --> 27:02.680
But don't you owe our audience
an explanation for the death
of Andrea Wyld,

27:02.720 --> 27:05.080
or the Mayor Ray Turnbull?

27:05.120 --> 27:08.480
Look, I know a lot of people
are frustrated with the way this
investigation has been handled.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.800
Well, if you'll forgive me,
you sound like a politician.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.600
I mean, do you genuinely
understand the public's anger?

27:13.640 --> 27:15.280
Yes.

27:15.320 --> 27:18.320
Because I too feel frustrated,
I feel angry, I feel afraid...

27:18.360 --> 27:21.200
So it would be fair to say
that you do feel
out of your depth.

27:21.240 --> 27:25.600
Good. You've come here to name
a second individual wanted
in connection with...

27:25.640 --> 27:27.480
If I sounded
like a politician,

27:27.520 --> 27:29.520
it's because I've been put
in a position where
I'm basically powerless.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.800
You know, the explorer
Pierre Brazza,

27:35.840 --> 27:38.840
colonized the country
my grandfather was born in.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.600
Brazza played the same game
with each local king.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.360
He held out two hands,

27:44.400 --> 27:48.440
in one hand, he held a piece
of cloth and in the other,
a bullet.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.400
He said,
"White man has two hands.

27:50.440 --> 27:53.520
"the hand of war
and the hand of trade.

27:54.720 --> 27:57.240
"Which hand
do you want to shake?"

27:57.280 --> 28:02.320
I'm in a position where
I'm having to make the same,
boring, exhausting choice.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.640
Stay silent
and remain numb

28:06.680 --> 28:09.960
or speak out and watch
my world go up in flames.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.920
But when the police

28:11.960 --> 28:15.640
put protecting ourselves,
as an institution,
ahead of protecting the public,

28:16.960 --> 28:18.480
then there's not even
a choice anymore.

28:18.520 --> 28:20.240
Are the police
trying to repress

28:20.280 --> 28:22.400
the name of the second
individual involved
in the Ragdoll case?

28:22.440 --> 28:23.640
Nathan Rose

28:23.680 --> 28:25.600
is a danger to himself
and to others.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.960
He is a profoundly
traumatized man

28:30.000 --> 28:32.400
who deserves the chance
to answer for his crimes.

28:32.440 --> 28:35.600
If you see him,
do not approach him.
Call 999 instead.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.000
Thank you.

28:37.040 --> 28:40.480
Finally, we get
a straight answer. Thank you.

28:40.520 --> 28:43.640
Now, British fishermen
were promised calm waters,

28:43.680 --> 28:45.880
but a new storm is brewing
in Europe.

28:51.360 --> 28:54.720
Okay,
we're back on, three, two...

29:39.520 --> 29:41.320
You gotta
enjoy yourself too...

29:41.360 --> 29:45.560
I'm just staying here
while the police investigate
my husband.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.440
<i>Nathan Rose is a danger
to himself and to others.</i>

29:48.480 --> 29:51.320
<i>He is a profoundly
traumatized man</i>

29:51.360 --> 29:53.560
<i>who deserves the chance
to answer for his crimes.</i>

29:53.600 --> 29:56.960
<i>If you see him,
do not approach him,
call 999 instead.</i>

29:57.000 --> 29:57.960
Thank you.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.040
If you want
to save Baxter's life...

30:28.080 --> 30:29.400
What are you talking about?

30:31.440 --> 30:32.800
What have you done to her?

30:34.800 --> 30:38.560
Go there at midnight.
Go alone. No police.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.600
Tommy doesn't want to kill her.

30:40.640 --> 30:43.080
But when he's made
to do something
he doesn't want to do,

30:43.120 --> 30:45.960
he does it
in a really filthy mood.

32:03.760 --> 32:07.160
<i>Meet me at the TV studio
where Joy Massey worked.
Come alone.</i>

32:07.200 --> 32:10.960
What? Rose, Baxter's missing,
no one knows where she is.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.280
She's here.
Massey's got her.

32:13.320 --> 32:15.360
<i>Just come alone,
do you hear me?
No backup.</i>

32:15.400 --> 32:16.840
- No! <i>
- Please.</i>

32:16.880 --> 32:18.600
Joy Massey told me
to come alone.

32:18.640 --> 32:20.320
<i>You were right about her.</i>

32:20.360 --> 32:23.400
He's gonna kill her,
just to mess with you.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Come alone.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.080
Bax...

32:45.120 --> 32:46.280
Are you okay?

32:46.320 --> 32:47.480
Stop! Kick the gun away.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.440
I dealt with him.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.920
- Stabbed him with a box cutter.
- On your own? Are you hurt?

32:52.960 --> 32:54.160
Stop! Kick the gun away.

32:54.200 --> 32:56.840
- Come on, don't be so stu...
- Stupid?

32:56.880 --> 33:00.240
I was never going to pull
the trigger. I... I'd never
actually hurt you.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.560
You fucking destroyed me.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.680
Don't say that.

33:06.360 --> 33:07.720
Here...

33:12.640 --> 33:13.800
Cuff yourself.

33:23.240 --> 33:25.120
- Emily, what have you done?
- Put them on.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.160
I'm treating you the same way
that I treated Massey.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.760
Don't do this.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.320
Cuff yourself to the railings.
Tie your hands behind your back.

33:30.360 --> 33:32.400
- Please, you don't have
to do this.
- Yes, I do!

33:32.440 --> 33:34.720
- This is the only way that
you can come back from...
- I don't want to come back.

33:34.760 --> 33:36.280
Yes you do.
Don't say that.

33:37.360 --> 33:39.120
If you love me,
do the right thing!

33:46.560 --> 33:48.080
This time will you visit me?

33:51.160 --> 33:52.480
Yeah.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.240
Come and get me.

34:19.400 --> 34:20.680
Let this man go,
that was the deal.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.040
How does it feel, Nathan?

34:28.080 --> 34:29.800
You bastard!

34:29.840 --> 34:33.720
You know, I'm happy
that you have finally
done the right thing.

34:33.760 --> 34:36.360
Now, I knew you wouldn't do it
to save yourself
or anyone else,

34:36.400 --> 34:37.600
but you'd do it for her...

34:38.080 --> 34:39.120
to atone.

34:41.720 --> 34:42.880
Emily...

34:46.320 --> 34:47.480
Know what one of these is?

34:48.840 --> 34:50.000
Hmm?

34:53.600 --> 34:57.040
Take it and this man lives.
I won't hurt him.

34:57.080 --> 34:59.920
- What's in it?
- Paraquat. Weed killer.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.560
I won't bore you
with the chemistry, it shouldn't
affect your decision.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.120
Don't do it! Don't take it!

35:06.160 --> 35:09.080
You hear that?
Rose wants him to die!

35:09.120 --> 35:10.440
But you're nothing like Rose!

35:10.480 --> 35:12.720
Emily, you're one
of the good cops!

35:12.760 --> 35:14.600
The heroes we hear
so much about!

35:14.640 --> 35:17.040
You'll do whatever it takes
to save an innocent life.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.520
Take it!

35:18.560 --> 35:20.440
Bax, don't do it.

35:20.480 --> 35:21.720
Don't take it.

35:21.760 --> 35:24.320
Bax. Emily.

35:24.360 --> 35:26.120
You don't have to do this!

35:27.040 --> 35:28.360
Bax.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.680
Take it. Take it.

35:31.720 --> 35:35.720
Bax! Bax! Bax! Emily! Bax!

35:35.760 --> 35:37.680
Please! Jesus Christ!

35:43.120 --> 35:45.280
You're gonna have
to control your breathing.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.840
See, the paraquat,
it's in your lungs now,

35:47.880 --> 35:49.360
spreading throughout
her alveoli.

35:51.280 --> 35:53.360
Yeah, and oxygen is going
to aggressively accelerate
the blistering.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.840
With each breath, more and more
blisters burst,

35:55.880 --> 35:57.800
filling her lungs with fluid.

35:57.840 --> 36:02.280
She's going to feel like
she's drowning in fire.

36:02.320 --> 36:06.440
You see,
I wanted to recreate the effect
of drinking molten gold,

36:06.480 --> 36:11.320
only this, this will take her
longer to die.

36:13.320 --> 36:17.080
Now, I assume you haven't really
called for backup?

36:17.840 --> 36:19.400
No, of course you haven't.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.520
Because then,
you would be forced
to tell the truth.

36:24.760 --> 36:27.080
You see,
that noise is going to be
quite distressing.

36:27.120 --> 36:29.040
Her hearing is going
to be the last thing to go.

36:29.080 --> 36:32.040
So, you have 40 minutes
to apologize.

36:37.880 --> 36:41.560
I mean, how many people
get to say that
they have received

36:41.600 --> 36:45.160
precisely the punishment
they deserve?

36:45.200 --> 36:48.840
It won't be a punishment
if I die before she does.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.520
You die when I say you die.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.680
Don't do that.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.520
- Stop it!

36:58.560 --> 36:59.680
Jesus Christ!

37:19.600 --> 37:20.720
Emily!

37:22.320 --> 37:24.120
Officer down!
I need an ambulance right now!

37:24.160 --> 37:26.360
Don't put her on oxygen!
Do you understand?

37:26.400 --> 37:29.920
She's inhaled paraquat,
it's a weed killer.
Get her on dialysis.

37:32.640 --> 37:35.960
Shit! Wait, I left my...
My cuffs on my desk.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.280
Here, these, use these.

37:39.720 --> 37:41.200
The keys are in
Baxter's pocket.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.400
Here. Here. Here.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.400
- Stop!
- Leave him. Armed response.

37:50.440 --> 37:51.880
No! They'll kill him!

38:03.120 --> 38:06.480
Here. Here. Here.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.120
I'm sorry.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.960
I'm so sorry.

39:40.040 --> 39:42.080
No, no, no!

39:42.120 --> 39:43.720
This is all wrong.
What are you wearing?

39:43.760 --> 39:47.040
You are meant
to be Mrs. Martha Evans.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.440
Born July 13th, 1972.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.640
- I'm not coming, Tommy.
- Yes you are. Don't be stupid.

39:51.680 --> 39:54.360
- We are leaving on the 6:17
to Marseilles.
- I'm sorry.

39:55.920 --> 39:59.360
We've just grown apart.

39:59.400 --> 40:00.680
Since when?

40:00.720 --> 40:02.400
Look at ya, hun,

40:02.440 --> 40:05.000
your wig's all crooked.
I've tried my best
to nurture you,

40:05.760 --> 40:07.640
but you've bottled it.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.960
I protected you.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.360
There is nothing in that house,
nothing, that pins it on you.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.240
Hmm, that's me bottling it,
yeah?

40:16.520 --> 40:19.080
I really thought you were
gonna be the one. But...

40:21.440 --> 40:23.160
you gotta kiss a lot of frogs.

40:24.440 --> 40:25.640
A lot of them.

40:25.680 --> 40:28.760
How dare you
turn your back on me.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.960
I just can't see myself
on the run.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.200
Dyeing me hair
in train station toilets,

40:33.240 --> 40:34.960
while everybody
back home's being like,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.680
"Whatever happened
to the whatsit, Ragdoll,

40:37.720 --> 40:40.320
"the murders that died
on their ass a bit?"

40:40.360 --> 40:42.000
I don't want to fade away.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.600
- You want to burn out?
- I want to burn and burn.

40:44.640 --> 40:48.120
You are nobody.
You are nothing.

40:48.160 --> 40:51.280
And no one will forget
what I have done.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.720
I'll have to be
the judge of that.

42:04.640 --> 42:06.000
Did you check in
with Europol?

42:06.040 --> 42:09.320
Uh-huh.
Still no sign of Rose.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.920
He still kids himself that
"Wo ist die techno-party?"

42:11.960 --> 42:13.600
opens up a lot of doors
in Germany.

42:13.640 --> 42:16.160
That's very specific.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.600
It's from a drinking game.

42:17.640 --> 42:19.480
I put whiskey in my coffee
this morning.

42:23.080 --> 42:24.200
Oh.

42:25.160 --> 42:27.000
Okay.

42:27.040 --> 42:29.480
Sorry. I wanted to tell someone
that wasn't gonna say,
"I told you so."

42:29.520 --> 42:31.120
I'm gonna knock it
on the head.

42:31.160 --> 42:34.040
That's awesome.
Anything you need, ma'am.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.560
There's one thing
I can't work out.

42:38.600 --> 42:41.040
How did Rose know which hotel
Joy Massey was staying in?

42:45.320 --> 42:48.160
I don't know, um...

42:48.200 --> 42:53.920
Maybe Massey told him?
Maybe it was part of the...
whatever, the game?

42:53.960 --> 42:57.240
Sorry, ma'am, um, there's been
a crime passionnel
down Surrey Quays.

42:57.280 --> 42:59.440
I wouldn't even know
how to get to Surrey Quays.

42:59.480 --> 43:02.040
I think I might have been there
one time after falling asleep
pissed on the night bus.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.280
Edmunds, I'll ride with you.

43:06.320 --> 43:07.560
Yeah.

43:30.520 --> 43:31.760
- Just one sec.

43:34.360 --> 43:35.800
DS Edmunds.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.760
<i>It's Leo Russo.
How you doing?</i>

43:37.800 --> 43:41.640
Captain? I'm good. Thank you.

43:41.680 --> 43:45.000
<i>Look, we had a call
a couple of months ago
from a sergeant in London.</i>

43:45.040 --> 43:46.840
<i>Nathan Rose?</i>

43:46.880 --> 43:49.120
Rose called you? What about?

43:49.600 --> 43:50.800
<i>Naomi Green.</i>

43:51.760 --> 43:53.600
Oh.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.400
I hope Rose didn't make you
go digging.

43:55.440 --> 43:58.640
Naomi's no longer relevant
to a case over here.

43:58.680 --> 44:02.280
<i>Well, look,
there's been a development.</i>

44:37.160 --> 44:39.000
<i>The body in the trunk
was so decomposed...</i>

44:54.040 --> 44:56.640
<i>Do you know what to do
when you get pulled out
to sea?</i>

44:56.680 --> 44:58.680
<i>Do you think
the past is real?</i>

44:58.720 --> 45:01.360
<i>I will die
with piece.</i>

45:01.400 --> 45:03.200
<i>How is this
making you feel?</i>

45:23.320 --> 45:25.320
Another game?

45:27.760 --> 45:29.960
<i>♪ So much pain</i>

45:32.520 --> 45:34.000
<i>♪ Look around</i>

45:36.080 --> 45:38.360
<i>♪ We just take it as it comes</i>

45:39.880 --> 45:42.160
<i>♪ We're dancing in the dark</i>

45:46.440 --> 45:51.640
<i>♪ So much pain</i>
