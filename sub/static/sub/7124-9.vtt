00:31.732 --> 00:35.701
Ugh. Huh? Wha?
Where am I?

00:35.769 --> 00:39.772
Gunther?
(owl hooting) (crickets chirping)

00:39.840 --> 00:48.247
Gunther? I don't think
this is Gunther. (humming)

00:48.315 --> 00:51.984
- It's me, Ice King.
- Lumpy Space Princess?

00:52.052 --> 00:56.656
- Yeah.
- And you're doing this because you like me?

00:56.724 --> 01:00.226
No. Ice King, listen. I'm gonna
give you the straight dope.

01:00.294 --> 01:04.063
- Okay. - You're weird and old,
and you kidnap princesses.

01:04.131 --> 01:07.002
- I know.
- But I asked you here tonight,

01:07.003 --> 01:09.634
because I want to know
what you think of this.

01:09.702 --> 01:15.139
"The prince who wanted everything,
a Fionna and Cake adventure?"

01:15.207 --> 01:19.145
- Hey, why isn't my name on there?
- I want you to read it because

01:19.246 --> 01:23.149
you're their dad. Please be their
dad right now and bring them to life!

01:23.217 --> 01:27.687
(sighs) Okay. Might as well,
at least until the cops show up.

01:27.754 --> 01:32.525
(clears throat) "Once upon a time, there
was a most handsome prince, the future

01:32.526 --> 01:37.196
- king of Lumpy Space, Lumpy Space Prince."
- Where do you want these

01:37.264 --> 01:41.067
- gold-plated sandwiches, your highness?
- By the window!

01:41.135 --> 01:45.239
No! That's not how I sound!
Read it in a better voice!

01:45.307 --> 01:50.610
Okay, okay. Sheesh! (english accent)
By the window, for from the window

01:50.677 --> 01:54.881
shall I shower the poor with
presents, as is my altruistic nature.

01:54.982 --> 01:58.818
(laughs) Eat! Eat, my children!
(zoom!)

01:58.886 --> 02:02.487
(zoom!) (zip! thud!)
Aah!

02:02.555 --> 02:07.292
- Son! Come here at once!
- But all was not perfect

02:07.360 --> 02:12.531
for this philanthropic prince of the people.
His parents were slobbering monsters who

02:12.598 --> 02:18.403
didn't care that he was a beautiful prince.
They wanted him to be a monster, too.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.807
Why aren't you working on
your monster exercises?

02:21.875 --> 02:26.255
- I don't want to be a monster.
- Eat these worms!

02:26.256 --> 02:28.836
- No!
- You will eat them!

02:28.837 --> 02:31.551
- I won't eat them.
- Sharpen your teeth!

02:31.618 --> 02:34.232
- No!
- Eat these worms!

02:34.233 --> 02:36.892
Eat those worms and
sharpen those teeth!

02:36.893 --> 02:41.445
No, no, no! I've told you hundreds of
times that I don't want to be a monster!

02:41.446 --> 02:47.100
And there is nothing you
can do about it! (gasps)

02:55.168 --> 03:00.239
(sparkle!)
Aah! Aah!

03:00.340 --> 03:04.610
(insects buzzing)
Oh! Stop it! Aah! (gasping)

03:04.711 --> 03:09.648
(coughs)
Ugh! Where am I? (gasps)

03:09.716 --> 03:14.053
(birds chirping)
Who's there? Reveal yourself!

03:14.120 --> 03:19.058
Hmm. Citizens of this realm, I am
the one and only heir to the throne

03:19.125 --> 03:24.196
of the Lumpy Space Kingdom. I mean, I
used to be. I rebelled against my parents,

03:24.264 --> 03:29.735
and now I'm a refugee.
What's that? You wish to help me?

03:29.803 --> 03:35.640
I'm touched! Fetch me some clothes and
I'll pay you handsomely by petting you.

03:35.641 --> 03:41.113
First, I need freaky clothes!
Cool freaky, not monster freaky.

03:41.181 --> 03:48.621
Oh, yes, and something to read, as
well, something mind-blowing. Oh, wait!

03:48.622 --> 03:53.396
I also need servants. Recruit
some locals. They won't mind.

03:57.464 --> 04:03.102
(munch!) (hisses)
Hmm. Not bad.

04:03.203 --> 04:11.942
Well done, my child. Next!
"Massenpsychologie und ich-analyse."

04:12.010 --> 04:16.148
- That does sound mind-blowing.
- Hiya. Hiya!

04:16.214 --> 04:18.483
(whoosh!)
Aha! (ting!)

04:18.552 --> 04:22.322
Cake, I'll save the captives.
You take care of those animals.

04:22.389 --> 04:27.960
Yaaah! (animals gasp, shriek) Ha!
Dance, you puppets! (squirrel squeaks)

04:28.028 --> 04:32.565
Ha! Ha! (ting!)
Hiya!

04:32.666 --> 04:37.056
- You're free to go, people!
- Whoo!

04:37.057 --> 04:40.603
- Hey, those were my servants.
- Hmm?

04:40.604 --> 04:45.276
What an innocent face. It shines
as if you have done no wrong.

04:45.744 --> 04:49.481
- Do you like my freaky clothes?
- I don't care about your clothes.

04:49.549 --> 04:51.750
Hey, you're not supposed
to read it like that.

04:51.818 --> 04:55.854
- Say it in a nicer way!
- I, uh... "I don't..."

04:55.922 --> 04:59.158
- ...care about your clothes.
- You don't? (helmet clinks)

04:59.225 --> 05:05.698
Finally, someone who's not impressed with my
noble looks, but admires what's inside of me.

05:05.765 --> 05:09.201
- Hmm? (crunches)
- Is this really happening?

05:09.269 --> 05:14.840
Your clothes are so raggedy and soiled,
and yet you use them as a napkin.

05:14.908 --> 05:18.980
You care not about your personal
appearance, nor hygiene.

05:20.248 --> 05:26.685
Dress me in the fashion of this peasant.
(animal squeaking) (fabric tearing)

05:26.753 --> 05:31.229
I have much to learn
from you, Fionna the human.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.719
- How'd he know your name?
- Unh!

05:33.720 --> 05:39.063
- Judo chop! Hiya! Hiya!
- Hmm, your movements are so free.

05:39.131 --> 05:44.202
My parents only want me to fly
like a proper monster, stiff and rigid,

05:44.270 --> 05:50.943
with a sharp-toothed scowl permanently
in place. But now I see a new way to move.

05:51.210 --> 06:00.485
Dance with me.
(romantic music plays) (sparkle!)

06:00.553 --> 06:05.023
- Y'all seeing those big, floaty faces?
- Pretty.

06:05.091 --> 06:09.061
(gasps)
No! Release! (sighs)

06:09.128 --> 06:13.131
- Ugh! What just happened?
- You were under my handsome

06:13.199 --> 06:17.837
spell for a moment. We can never marry,
you know. I can only be with someone who's

06:17.904 --> 06:23.442
my equal in every way, a person so much
like me that she doesn't even exist.

06:23.509 --> 06:27.946
I don't care, as long as we can
hang out. Anyone want a sandwich?

06:28.014 --> 06:36.021
Oh, I'll have one.
(creak! creak!) (thud!)

06:36.089 --> 06:43.528
(gasps)
So rustic, so humble. Delightful!

06:43.629 --> 06:47.433
(baby coos) (plate clinks)

06:47.501 --> 06:52.571
Wait. Where are your baby tables?
(munching) What?!

06:52.638 --> 06:57.509
(gulps) You don't dip your
foods in gold before eating?!

06:57.577 --> 07:03.115
Who eats gold?
(both munching) (nibbles)

07:03.182 --> 07:10.255
Great glob! What is this?!
So charming, so quaint,

07:10.323 --> 07:14.126
so self-reliant! Omh!
(munching)

07:14.193 --> 07:19.632
(sparkle! drip!) For years, I've thought
only of the needs of my people,

07:19.699 --> 07:27.737
but what about me? What do I need? This
poorly made sandwich has enlightened me!

- Huh? (grunts)
- Son!

08:39.732 --> 08:43.246
Flee, noble Fionna,

08:43.313 --> 08:46.418

- Silence!

08:46.485 --> 08:49.087
Aah! I'm just being honest. Huh?

08:49.155 --> 08:54.059
Come on, you beautiful dandy. Only your
pierced spirit can defeat your evil family.

08:54.126 --> 08:57.462
(ting!) And this sword.
(both growl)

08:57.530 --> 09:02.234

- You're right, Fionna.

09:02.301 --> 09:08.039
- This is my destiny. I do have the power.
- Aah!

09:08.107 --> 09:13.512
- Huh? Fionna!
- You must obey!

09:13.580 --> 09:22.487
- Ugh! My heart!
- Submit, young one. Become a true monster.

09:22.555 --> 09:27.526
- No. It isn't right.
- Silence!

09:27.694 --> 09:34.098
Ugh! Aah! (whoosh!) (explosion)
Oh, Fionna, this is the end for me.

09:34.166 --> 09:37.736
(gasps)
But at least I made you proud.

09:37.803 --> 09:42.207
- Didn't I?
- I don't care. (gasps)

09:42.275 --> 09:46.766
My glob, Fionna. You've been
telling me the answer all along.

09:46.767 --> 09:51.980
The only way to defeat parental
disapproval is not caring about anything.

Thank you, son.

10:15.543 --> 10:19.462
You've freed us from adult
mediocrity and fatuousness.

10:19.463 --> 10:23.581
I don't care!
