00:05.467 --> 00:06.767
(Episode 4)

00:06.767 --> 00:10.537
(Can You Tell If Someone
Is Rich by How They Eat Yogurt?)

00:11.113 --> 00:13.654
That hurts! Let go of my hand.

00:13.654 --> 00:16.784
You have to let go of her first
so that I can let go.

00:16.784 --> 00:17.823
That hurts.

00:19.054 --> 00:21.454
Let's use our words.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.724
This is a gallery.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.864
Get your hand off of me!

00:44.453 --> 00:46.583
Do you know how expensive this is?

00:47.684 --> 00:49.023
Who are you?

00:49.653 --> 00:50.824
What do you do?

00:51.763 --> 00:52.763
Me?

00:53.564 --> 00:55.833
I'm the new director
of this gallery.

00:58.903 --> 01:01.434
For how much are you
causing this scene?

01:05.203 --> 01:06.203
Wait.

01:11.073 --> 01:13.114
Mr. Jin, here.

01:15.484 --> 01:16.654
Three thousand dollars.

01:16.654 --> 01:17.853
Four thousand five hundred dollars.

01:18.353 --> 01:19.553
Two thousand eight hundred dollars.

01:20.023 --> 01:21.254
Six thousand nine hundred dollars.

01:25.264 --> 01:28.193
I can just pay you this much!

01:37.273 --> 01:38.943
That's not the bill.

01:40.204 --> 01:41.243
Sorry?

01:45.913 --> 01:47.043
(Cheongsong Gallery, 7,500 dollars)

01:47.043 --> 01:48.083
It's more.

01:51.314 --> 01:52.583
Seven thousand and five hundred.

01:55.293 --> 01:56.793
Thirteen thousand dollars.

01:57.394 --> 01:59.323
(Forty-five thousand dollars)

01:59.323 --> 02:00.693
Forty-five thousand dollars?

02:03.333 --> 02:04.493
A hundred and twenty thousand dollars?

02:11.704 --> 02:13.103
(Episode 4)

02:22.353 --> 02:24.353
That's nice.
Indeed, the best tea is...

02:27.823 --> 02:29.524
pu'er tea.

02:29.923 --> 02:31.293
That's Earl Grey tea.

02:31.293 --> 02:33.923
I saw how you didn't like pu'er tea
last time.

02:35.334 --> 02:38.133
I see. It's Earl Grey.

02:42.733 --> 02:44.874
You were joking earlier, right?

02:45.103 --> 02:46.904
About how you're the new director.

02:46.904 --> 02:48.173
I wasn't joking.

02:49.143 --> 02:52.084
As I've told you,
I'm a serious man of few words.

02:52.584 --> 02:55.684
Especially when it comes to money,
I never joke.

02:56.113 --> 02:59.084
What gives you the right to become
the director of our gallery?

02:59.084 --> 03:00.923
You said that you would do
as I wanted...

03:01.483 --> 03:04.224
and you'd accept
any type of repayment terms.

03:05.724 --> 03:07.363
Don't overthink it.

03:07.363 --> 03:10.094
I'm simply trying to make
my own money.

03:11.263 --> 03:14.034
Haven't you heard
of contingent management?

03:14.804 --> 03:16.374
When a company is having a hard time,

03:16.374 --> 03:20.543
the creditors hire
a management specialist to solve it.

03:21.004 --> 03:24.374
Because I'm amazing at making money.

03:24.714 --> 03:27.284
A gallery is not
where you make money.

03:30.913 --> 03:32.784
If you don't want it,
pay back the two million dollars.

03:33.654 --> 03:35.853
You went through that mess
with your customers...

03:35.853 --> 03:37.224
because you couldn't afford
a few ten thousand dollars.

03:37.224 --> 03:38.524
Do you have any other options?

03:41.724 --> 03:45.334
You don't have to set up
a whole new office for me.

03:47.064 --> 03:48.203
I'll just...

03:49.474 --> 03:52.274
use this one.

03:52.274 --> 03:54.173
I won't touch anything else.

03:55.943 --> 03:56.974
Deal?

04:04.513 --> 04:05.953
Earl Grey tea is nice.

04:06.784 --> 04:09.024
(Cheongsong Museum of Art)

04:13.964 --> 04:15.024
Sir?

04:21.233 --> 04:23.433
I could make a ridonkulous amount
of money from this.

04:23.433 --> 04:25.074
Why won't she agree?

04:25.704 --> 04:27.803
She's still not desperate enough.

04:27.873 --> 04:29.714
What is your plan?

04:29.714 --> 04:31.714
Do you think the chairman will
let this slide?

04:31.714 --> 04:32.944
You got another idea?

04:32.944 --> 04:34.714
You said that we should...

04:34.714 --> 04:37.253
humiliate and suffocate her
to just retrieve the principal.

04:37.613 --> 04:40.024
No, that's too unsophisticated.

04:40.024 --> 04:41.353
It's not my way of doing things.

04:42.553 --> 04:44.524
It is exactly your way
of doing things.

04:48.194 --> 04:50.863
The principal and interest.

04:52.563 --> 04:53.933
That's how I do it.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.110
Then where should we go to work now?

05:02.911 --> 05:05.011
Go to work at your restaurant as you
normally do, starting tomorrow.

05:05.011 --> 05:06.021
The restaurant?

05:06.521 --> 05:07.680
- Darn it.
- Darn it.

05:13.391 --> 05:17.091
They said everything was fine
a couple of days ago,

05:17.860 --> 05:20.031
so I don't know why they're suddenly
throwing a fit.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.471
The photos are all over
social media.

05:23.471 --> 05:25.201
They must've gotten a grasp
on the situation.

05:26.571 --> 05:27.600
By the way,

05:28.170 --> 05:31.411
do you think
we'll get paid this month?

05:33.781 --> 05:36.480
I know. Can't we just ask
Segi Group for help?

05:39.581 --> 05:40.850
What are you talking about?

05:42.721 --> 05:43.750
Ms. Na.

05:44.190 --> 05:45.221
What?

05:45.891 --> 05:48.021
I heard they almost got married.

05:48.990 --> 05:50.761
This isn't the time to save face.

05:50.761 --> 05:52.761
It's better than losing the company
to a bunch of thugs.

05:54.761 --> 05:57.401
The director worked so hard
to establish this gallery.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.201
If I was his daughter,

06:00.540 --> 06:04.011
I would've already gone to my ex-fiance,
even my ex-husband,

06:04.911 --> 06:06.310
and begged for help.

06:07.511 --> 06:10.911
Don't you know how much
the director hated Segi Group?

06:11.781 --> 06:14.221
No matter how hard things were,
our director...

06:14.620 --> 06:17.190
never let us mention Segi Group
becoming a sponsor.

06:17.721 --> 06:20.190
Even when Director Jang Tae Jin
came and got on his knees,

06:20.190 --> 06:23.631
our director refused to even
open the door for him.

06:23.891 --> 06:26.661
You saw all of that,
so how could you even bring that up?

06:26.661 --> 06:28.701
The situation isn't the same
as it was then.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.401
If she wasn't competent,
she shouldn't have inherited it.

06:34.370 --> 06:36.711
Ms. Kim, what are you doing
standing out here?

06:38.680 --> 06:39.711
Come on in.

06:43.281 --> 06:45.050
Why are you all standing around
like this?

06:45.420 --> 06:46.651
You're all acting strange.

06:48.350 --> 06:51.120
What brings you here?

06:53.420 --> 06:56.230
About the Basquiat exhibit
you mentioned last time...

06:56.531 --> 06:57.961
Oh, right.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.531
How much is the penalty
to cancel it?

07:07.141 --> 07:08.571
You want to cancel it?

07:10.440 --> 07:13.540
I thought that was the only way
we could handle urgent matters.

07:16.050 --> 07:17.110
We can't.

07:18.550 --> 07:21.480
The only thing that attracts
big audiences in Korea is pop art.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.451
Furthermore, it's Basquiat.

07:24.190 --> 07:26.821
We can attract attention without
doing a lot of promotions.

07:26.821 --> 07:29.091
We can easily get sponsored
by big companies too.

07:29.391 --> 07:31.730
Many people will buy souvenirs too.

07:31.860 --> 07:33.161
But you want to give up on this?

07:34.560 --> 07:37.430
We'll be missing out on
something bigger by doing that.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.471
Instead of that,

07:41.901 --> 07:44.641
why don't you come with me
to meet with some sponsors?

07:45.511 --> 07:47.110
They already know our situation,

07:47.110 --> 07:49.511
and they have a long-standing
relationship with Cheongsong,

07:49.511 --> 07:51.151
so I'm sure they won't ignore us.

07:58.761 --> 08:01.920
Then can you give me the documents
on the Basquiat exhibit?

08:01.920 --> 08:04.961
I'll review how far we got
in the planning and decide then.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.060
Okay.

08:08.401 --> 08:11.670
Oh, right.
Did Si Hyung come into work?

08:13.800 --> 08:16.411
Want to have a drink with me?

08:16.411 --> 08:17.511
I looked over,

08:17.511 --> 08:19.881
- and you guys were shining.
- Hey!

08:19.881 --> 08:21.411
Don't invite Kim Si Hyung next time.

08:22.011 --> 08:25.081
He's like a hobo begging for drinks.

08:25.081 --> 08:28.021
Just let it go.
He's really poor now.

08:29.490 --> 08:32.091
- You're right. That's right.
- Oh, right.

08:32.091 --> 08:34.360
His uncle is dead.

08:34.690 --> 08:36.929
His own father gave up on him,

08:36.929 --> 08:38.330
but his uncle gave him money...

08:38.330 --> 08:40.361
and even bought him a car.
Oh, and his cafe?

08:40.361 --> 08:41.900
His uncle gave him that too.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.501
He was a walking ATM machine.

08:44.501 --> 08:46.440
I was so jealous of that.

08:46.570 --> 08:50.040
I heard he's been borrowing money
from Mr. Ha of Palace.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.670
He's on his last leg.

08:51.871 --> 08:52.940
- Really?
- Hold on.

08:53.781 --> 08:57.111
Mr. Ha of Palace?
Isn't he a gangster?

08:57.180 --> 08:58.481
Seriously?

09:02.050 --> 09:05.391
Our poor Si Hyung.
What are we going to do about him?

09:06.161 --> 09:08.720
Gosh, you pushover old fart.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.960
You should've said something
before you kicked the bucket!

09:12.231 --> 09:14.731
Then Si Hyung wouldn't have
ended up like this.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.901
Darn it!
Did you just hit me, you jerk?

09:26.241 --> 09:28.741
Apparently, he got into a fight
while drinking with his friends.

09:30.580 --> 09:34.080
I talked to his friends,
so they probably won't file a suit.

09:35.991 --> 09:38.590
I told you I'd send him home.
Why did you come all the way here?

09:41.991 --> 09:42.991
Mr. Kim.

09:48.131 --> 09:49.200
Mr. Kim!

09:51.170 --> 09:53.300
Darn it.

09:53.840 --> 09:56.440
Darn it. You're so noisy.

09:58.070 --> 09:59.481
What?

10:07.180 --> 10:09.151
Darn it.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.151
Si Hyung.

10:12.420 --> 10:13.460
Hold on.

10:13.460 --> 10:15.991
Darn it. How dare you grab my arm?

10:19.330 --> 10:20.361
I'm sorry.

10:21.861 --> 10:23.200
Did you get my messages?

10:23.731 --> 10:26.141
I called and sent texts too.

10:26.871 --> 10:29.210
So? What did you want to say?

10:31.540 --> 10:34.781
It's nothing. I wanted to talk
to you about the gallery,

10:35.440 --> 10:38.210
but you don't seem well,
so we'll talk later.

10:39.881 --> 10:41.950
Are you kidding me?

10:43.491 --> 10:44.550
What about the gallery?

10:46.261 --> 10:49.391
You had no idea what your father
was going through,

10:49.391 --> 10:52.190
and you were busy being a princess,
traveling here and there.

10:52.460 --> 10:55.200
And then you show up and assume
the position of director. But what?

10:56.601 --> 10:57.700
You want to talk about the gallery?

11:01.040 --> 11:02.070
Hey.

11:02.970 --> 11:04.011
Listen carefully.

11:04.871 --> 11:06.141
I only have one thing to say.

11:07.381 --> 11:09.710
Get lost and go back
to where you came from.

11:22.830 --> 11:25.960
Hello. Look into the situations
of the gallery's clients...

11:25.960 --> 11:27.060
and pay them.

11:27.601 --> 11:28.601
All of these?

11:28.901 --> 11:30.070
Of course. Do you want me to lose...

11:30.070 --> 11:31.470
my two million dollars
over chump change?

11:31.871 --> 11:35.470
And bring me all the information
on domestic and foreign galleries.

11:35.470 --> 11:37.611
Focus on the ones that make
a lot of money.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.540
- Hey!
- That surprised me!

11:39.540 --> 11:40.710
- You punk!
- What's this?

11:40.710 --> 11:42.911
What on earth have you been up to?

11:42.911 --> 11:44.251
What is it this time?

11:44.251 --> 11:45.351
"What is it this time?"

11:45.450 --> 11:47.820
Do you think you're Mother Teresa
or Monk Bopjong?

11:47.820 --> 11:50.851
Instead of collecting the money
I told you to get, you got conned.

11:50.851 --> 11:52.820
- Hold on.
- What are you talking about?

11:52.820 --> 11:55.521
Sir. Let go of him first! Please!

11:57.161 --> 11:59.930
I heard you paid off Cheongsong's debts
instead of getting paid.

12:00.131 --> 12:02.330
Why don't you just throw money
off the roof?

12:02.330 --> 12:04.631
Let me see how it feels to get hit
with a wad of cash from you.

12:04.631 --> 12:06.501
No, why don't you give me
some money,

12:06.501 --> 12:08.340
so I can get a taste
of some big money?

12:09.210 --> 12:10.611
- That hurts!
- You punk!

12:10.611 --> 12:13.611
Move over!

12:13.611 --> 12:15.881
My gosh! Do you know
how expensive this is?

12:16.251 --> 12:19.751
This is a precious piece of art,
so be careful with it.

12:19.751 --> 12:21.320
Okay. Come this way.

12:21.320 --> 12:23.190
Move over!

12:23.190 --> 12:25.251
Move over!

12:25.251 --> 12:27.121
Come this way, sir.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.631
- Watch the angle. Careful.
- Yes, ma'am.

12:29.631 --> 12:32.190
- Yes, we're being careful.
- Let's go.

12:42.070 --> 12:43.210
What is this?

12:43.641 --> 12:45.570
What is it, and why would you
hang it in my office?

12:46.281 --> 12:49.050
You didn't pay for this, right?

12:49.050 --> 12:50.680
What are you talking about?

12:50.680 --> 12:53.680
A human cultural asset
drew this himself.

12:53.881 --> 12:55.751
A human cultural asset?

12:56.651 --> 12:58.220
Do you have money to burn like this?

12:58.790 --> 13:00.190
Gosh, my ears.

13:01.661 --> 13:03.891
Who said I had money to burn?

13:03.891 --> 13:06.261
I did this to prevent money
from being wasted.

13:11.930 --> 13:14.970
There's a flow to money too.

13:15.101 --> 13:19.281
Apparently, the flow of our
company's money stops right here.

13:19.281 --> 13:23.310
Right here. In Moo Hak's office.
Okay?

13:23.751 --> 13:26.251
Moo Hak's energy is so strong,

13:26.251 --> 13:28.851
so it's stopping the flow
of our company's money.

13:28.851 --> 13:32.220
It's completely immovable.

13:32.861 --> 13:34.720
If we don't open this up,

13:34.720 --> 13:36.731
it'll only be a matter of time...

13:36.731 --> 13:39.261
before our new business fails,
and we lose all our money.

13:41.361 --> 13:44.501
He even said it would harm
your health, honey.

13:46.670 --> 13:47.741
What?

13:48.241 --> 13:50.810
Where did you hear such
an ominous thing like that?

13:51.970 --> 13:54.411
Has Dr. Kim ever been wrong?

13:54.741 --> 13:58.751
He guessed how he was conned
out of two million dollars too.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.420
I wasn't conned out of anything!

14:02.851 --> 14:05.720
He said someone
passed away recently.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.690
Does anyone know someone
who died recently?

14:08.690 --> 14:10.590
Do you?

14:12.560 --> 14:13.901
Oh, my. Ki Chul. What's wrong?

14:13.901 --> 14:15.761
What's wrong? Oh, dear.

14:15.761 --> 14:16.771
I'm fine.

14:18.670 --> 14:21.241
So will things get better
if we hang that drawing?

14:21.800 --> 14:23.710
Yes. Of course.

14:24.810 --> 14:28.141
He said it was good to hang
a drawing of water.

14:28.540 --> 14:31.281
Our flow of money will open up,
and our bad luck will go away.

14:31.281 --> 14:33.781
It's really good in every way.

14:34.420 --> 14:38.151
I paid a lot of money for it,
so don't take it down. Okay?

14:38.251 --> 14:40.661
I don't need it. You can hang it up
in Ki Chul's office.

14:40.661 --> 14:43.731
That's right. Moo Hak must not like it.
We can hang it in my...

14:43.731 --> 14:45.531
- Oh, my!
- Goodness.

14:46.330 --> 14:48.960
My heels are too high.

14:49.131 --> 14:50.271
Goodness.

14:52.001 --> 14:54.300
- What is it?
- Come on.

14:57.511 --> 14:59.840
Why would you hang that
in your office?

14:59.840 --> 15:01.241
You don't even know what that is!

15:01.481 --> 15:03.981
Why not? You said it was
expensive and nice!

15:05.611 --> 15:07.680
Don't you know me?

15:07.680 --> 15:09.920
Do you think I would hang up
a painting to prevent misfortunes...

15:09.920 --> 15:12.290
in my stepson's office
when you're right here?

15:12.290 --> 15:13.661
Why would I help him?

15:13.761 --> 15:14.991
Then why did you hang it there?

15:16.560 --> 15:18.761
Moo Hak's energy is way too strong.

15:18.761 --> 15:21.001
So I wanted to keep
him trapped in the pond...

15:21.001 --> 15:22.361
and to subdue his energy too.

15:22.700 --> 15:23.771
I see.

15:25.231 --> 15:26.771
Goodness.

15:28.470 --> 15:31.540
By the way,
did you find out what I asked you?

15:31.641 --> 15:32.940
What did Dr. Kim say?

15:32.940 --> 15:34.741
Will it be prudent for me to expand
into the construction business?

15:35.180 --> 15:36.210
Oh, right.

15:37.381 --> 15:39.781
Apparently,
you found an excellent connection.

15:39.781 --> 15:41.521
It's supposed to be really good.

15:42.790 --> 15:43.920
Is that so?

15:44.590 --> 15:46.690
What? What is it?

15:46.690 --> 15:48.861
Tell me what it is. Please?

15:50.631 --> 15:52.330
No. We don't know for sure yet.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.871
I'll tell you once it's certain.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.851
Aren't you sick of eating gamjatang?

16:15.521 --> 16:17.190
Samgyetang, galbitang,

16:17.190 --> 16:20.021
lobster, shrimp toast,
and grilled octopus on a stick.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.090
There are so many delicious
and healthy dishes to choose from.

16:22.090 --> 16:23.460
But you always
want to eat gamjatang.

16:24.031 --> 16:25.190
You ungrateful brat.

16:25.190 --> 16:27.560
Aren't you too old
to be picky about food?

16:29.131 --> 16:30.901
What's the point of having money?

16:30.901 --> 16:33.271
Dad, you don't have a lot of
days left to spend your money now.

16:35.340 --> 16:37.011
Are you praying for my early death?

16:38.310 --> 16:40.481
Come on. That's disgusting.

16:43.011 --> 16:44.881
So what's your plan?

16:45.011 --> 16:46.180
What plan?

16:47.621 --> 16:49.991
Why don't you just take over
the gallery?

16:50.491 --> 16:51.521
What?

16:51.521 --> 16:53.590
Isn't that why
you gave them some money?

16:53.720 --> 16:55.320
You can spot opportunities
to make money a mile away.

16:55.320 --> 16:56.690
I doubt you're just helping them.

16:58.361 --> 16:59.430
Well...

17:00.830 --> 17:02.330
That's not a bad idea.

17:03.330 --> 17:04.930
Land doesn't rot.

17:05.601 --> 17:07.170
As long as the redevelopment
restrictions are lifted,

17:07.300 --> 17:08.470
we'll make a fortune.

17:08.470 --> 17:10.070
Taking over with two million dollars
would be a steal.

17:12.510 --> 17:15.940
And the daughter
of the late director might be smart.

17:15.940 --> 17:18.280
But she's naive and doesn't know
anything about business.

17:18.280 --> 17:20.680
So there are already a lot of
vultures eyeing the gallery.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.520
You should try to get her
on your side. Okay?

17:30.030 --> 17:33.260
Gosh, this is delicious.
I never get sick of this dish.

17:46.141 --> 17:49.041
And the daughter
of the late director might be smart.

17:49.041 --> 17:51.710
But she's naive and doesn't know
anything about business.

17:51.881 --> 17:54.351
So there are already a lot of
vultures eyeing the gallery.

17:55.651 --> 17:59.250
You should try to get her
on your side. Okay?

18:01.990 --> 18:04.891
We should start preparing the exhibit,
The Space,

18:04.891 --> 18:06.401
which we put off due to the funeral.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.631
And the artists have
their own schedules too.

18:08.631 --> 18:10.401
They can't wait any longer.

18:10.401 --> 18:13.170
Right. They have already been
so patient with us.

18:36.687 --> 18:37.856
Go on, please.

18:39.457 --> 18:40.457
Go ahead.

18:49.406 --> 18:50.437
Keep going.

18:51.636 --> 18:52.707
Okay.

18:53.537 --> 18:54.806
Right.

18:54.806 --> 18:56.707
We already have the arrangement plan
for the artwork.

18:56.707 --> 18:58.106
We should try to transport and install...

18:58.106 --> 19:01.376
the artwork by the end
of this month at the latest.

19:02.146 --> 19:03.787
Only then...

19:05.556 --> 19:09.586
we'll be able to open the exhibit
as scheduled.

19:09.656 --> 19:11.287
Oh, right.

19:12.126 --> 19:14.027
The merchandise and...

19:32.593 --> 19:34.593
I guess only rich people
work at this gallery.

19:35.634 --> 19:37.394
Well, I have some left here.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.634
Where was I? Right.

19:43.674 --> 19:45.273
I already ordered the merchandise...

19:45.273 --> 19:47.003
and received tickets
for private showings.

19:48.914 --> 19:50.174
"The Space"?

19:52.884 --> 19:55.654
Do you think we'll have enough time
to promote the exhibit?

19:56.313 --> 19:58.313
That's why...

19:58.654 --> 20:01.484
I'm trying to come up with
a novel idea that will grab...

20:01.684 --> 20:04.753
people's attention
in a short of period time.

20:04.753 --> 20:07.263
- Are these artists famous?
- Mr. Jin.

20:09.134 --> 20:11.434
Can't a man
even ask a question here?

20:14.503 --> 20:17.204
You might not know them
as you're not of this world.

20:17.404 --> 20:20.404
They are prominent artists
who have been showing...

20:20.404 --> 20:22.543
their art actively in Korea.

20:22.714 --> 20:24.813
And they've won many awards too.

20:25.374 --> 20:27.083
I see.

20:32.053 --> 20:34.724
We're going to launch
an art camp for kids...

20:34.724 --> 20:36.924
from Hope Orphanage
along with the exhibit, The Space.

20:36.924 --> 20:40.664
During this camp, the theme will be
Three Frogs of Sandro and Leonardo.

20:40.664 --> 20:41.994
I know this.

20:42.664 --> 20:44.763
Three Frogs of Sandro and Leonardo.

20:44.934 --> 20:46.704
Right? Isn't that
what you told me before?

20:47.363 --> 20:49.773
Who was the restaurant owner?

21:00.484 --> 21:02.914
So we'll invite a famous chef.

21:03.484 --> 21:06.884
And we'll cook from
the original recipes of da Vinci.

21:06.884 --> 21:09.593
Da Vinci. Yes. That's the name.

21:09.593 --> 21:11.454
Right. That's the name.

21:11.454 --> 21:13.523
So this guy originally wanted
to become a restaurant owner.

21:13.793 --> 21:15.964
Yes. Oh, my. That's true.

21:17.333 --> 21:20.404
By the way, kids from the orphanage
won't have any money.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.134
How can we invite a famous chef,
let alone throw a camp for them?

21:23.934 --> 21:25.803
Even if we come up
with a low budget,

21:25.803 --> 21:27.904
we won't have enough money
to do everything you planned.

21:28.503 --> 21:30.644
The rates
for these famous TV chefs...

21:30.644 --> 21:32.214
are ridiculously high.

21:32.214 --> 21:33.684
The world has changed now.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.954
It's a free educational program...

21:35.954 --> 21:38.013
called the Cheongsong Art Camp...

21:38.013 --> 21:41.253
for children who don't have
the privilege of learning about art.

21:44.293 --> 21:47.363
We don't charge people for that.
Gosh. Come on. Just leave.

21:48.093 --> 21:49.863
A free educational program.

21:53.234 --> 21:54.333
What?

21:55.533 --> 21:56.603
Free?

22:00.144 --> 22:01.374
Free?

22:02.944 --> 22:04.944
What a load of garbage!

22:15.384 --> 22:17.553
What do you think
you're doing, Mr. Jin?

22:17.553 --> 22:19.924
I should be asking you that.

22:20.093 --> 22:21.363
Free?

22:21.694 --> 22:25.063
And it's not a one-time event.
It's a quarterly event? What?

22:25.263 --> 22:26.533
You're inviting three groups?

22:30.003 --> 22:32.234
Do you think you're Mother Teresa?

22:32.773 --> 22:34.674
Are you Monk Bopjong?

22:34.674 --> 22:36.613
The Cheongsong Art Camp
has been held...

22:36.613 --> 22:38.773
by two generations of my family,
mainly my father and grandfather.

22:38.773 --> 22:41.714
This is the most important
educational program at our gallery.

22:41.914 --> 22:44.513
This is one of the few opportunities
for underprivileged kids...

22:44.513 --> 22:46.124
to experience art.

22:46.553 --> 22:48.984
Do you know how much
the kids love this program?

22:48.984 --> 22:50.994
We should be thinking about
holding the event more frequently.

22:51.523 --> 22:52.694
But you want to cancel it?

22:53.323 --> 22:54.394
Fine.

22:55.063 --> 22:56.934
That's great.

22:56.934 --> 22:58.694
Of course, I know
this is a great deed you're doing.

22:58.994 --> 23:01.904
Helping out kids who don't get
a taste of art and culture...

23:01.904 --> 23:03.204
is excellent.

23:03.204 --> 23:04.474
You have my respect.

23:05.204 --> 23:07.204
But with what money?

23:08.073 --> 23:09.374
Do you have money?

23:11.174 --> 23:13.414
Have you secretly been keeping
my money instead of paying me back?

23:15.583 --> 23:18.184
I should try to find sponsors now.

23:19.853 --> 23:20.853
What?

23:21.624 --> 23:24.093
You were going to do a good deed
with someone else's money?

23:24.954 --> 23:26.023
Gosh.

23:29.134 --> 23:33.003
Goodness. Your family is supposed
to be the most prestigious family.

23:33.603 --> 23:35.333
Actually, you were just a thief.

23:35.333 --> 23:37.103
- Mr. Jin.
- What?

23:37.474 --> 23:39.944
You use someone else's money
to act all posh.

23:39.944 --> 23:41.003
Isn't that what thieves do?

23:41.303 --> 23:43.644
Since it's not your money,
you don't know how valuable it is.

23:43.644 --> 23:45.714
You'll invite a famous chef
and hold the event for free.

23:45.714 --> 23:47.714
You sure are generous.

23:48.414 --> 23:50.753
Do you think other people
have money growing on trees?

23:50.753 --> 23:52.823
This is why
you're about to go under!

23:53.253 --> 23:56.093
Because of the royal mess
your father made,

23:56.093 --> 23:58.154
your investors and banks
can't even sleep at night.

23:58.154 --> 24:00.023
They are awfully worried right now.
But what?

24:00.023 --> 24:02.063
A free art camp?
Don't you know the situation you're in?

24:02.063 --> 24:04.634
Watch what you're saying, Mr. Jin.

24:05.093 --> 24:06.734
Excuse me. Kim Da Li.

24:07.803 --> 24:09.634
Do you still not get it?

24:10.273 --> 24:12.033
Do you not know where you belong?

24:13.003 --> 24:17.474
You're no longer the only daughter
of the honorable Cheongsong family,

24:17.474 --> 24:20.583
but someone who can't even afford
to buy a new pair of shoes.

24:20.583 --> 24:22.244
With nothing but crushing debt.

24:22.384 --> 24:24.583
You're in no position to help me!

24:27.424 --> 24:31.253
If you want to help someone,
help them with your earned money.

24:31.793 --> 24:33.624
Instead of begging.

24:39.964 --> 24:41.134
I'll pay you back.

24:45.103 --> 24:46.144
What?

24:47.374 --> 24:50.273
I said I would pay you back.

24:55.684 --> 24:58.583
I'll pay it all back in a week.

25:01.184 --> 25:02.184
And if you don't?

25:02.724 --> 25:05.753
Then I'll do whatever you want.

25:12.434 --> 25:13.634
Ms. Song.

25:13.833 --> 25:16.634
Please help me pick out a few pieces
that can be cashed immediately.

25:17.073 --> 25:18.073
What?

25:18.073 --> 25:19.944
How is the art scene these days?

25:19.944 --> 25:23.374
I remember Ms. Kim from Hannam-dong
was into my grandfather's work.

25:23.374 --> 25:24.813
Do you think she still is?

25:26.384 --> 25:29.714
As you know, we can't just sell
artwork registered with the gallery.

25:30.313 --> 25:32.313
The art scene is not doing well either.

25:32.684 --> 25:34.253
We have some that aren't registered.

25:34.654 --> 25:37.494
There should be quite a few
that are under my name.

25:38.753 --> 25:40.464
That's true...

25:42.833 --> 25:45.293
How much working capital
for the gallery do we have left?

25:47.603 --> 25:49.573
We don't have working capital.

25:49.974 --> 25:52.204
We don't even have the paychecks
for the employees this month.

25:52.944 --> 25:53.944
Excuse me?

25:55.244 --> 25:57.773
I know the economy is bad,
but a third?

25:58.174 --> 26:01.684
Yes, and that's if the transaction
goes well, which would be a miracle.

26:02.914 --> 26:04.914
The industry has dried up
in the past six months.

26:11.146 --> 26:12.247
One third?

26:13.194 --> 26:15.664
They're literally thieves,
just without knives.

26:16.960 --> 26:19.200
Mr. Choi will certainly help out.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.969
He went to both middle and high school
with your father,

26:21.200 --> 26:23.670
and when he was
running for Congress,

26:23.670 --> 26:25.440
your father was helping him directly
through campaigning.

26:26.769 --> 26:29.309
He would be a jerk not to help out.

26:29.809 --> 26:32.140
(K-1 Constructions)

26:32.140 --> 26:33.749
Sorry, but we can't.

26:33.850 --> 26:36.319
If you could just take a look...

26:38.180 --> 26:40.450
Please, just one minute.

26:41.590 --> 26:44.690
We really put our heart and soul
into this one.

26:44.690 --> 26:47.259
- We really tried...
- I'm sorry.

26:47.259 --> 26:50.130
- I'm sorry.
- You can take this. Please...

26:50.529 --> 26:53.799
(Sahae Distribution)

26:53.799 --> 26:56.140
Thank you.

26:56.799 --> 26:59.200
Take your time looking over it.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.309
Thank you.

27:00.309 --> 27:02.440
No, but...

27:02.440 --> 27:05.239
Excuse me. Hold on.

27:07.809 --> 27:09.779
Please take a look at this. Please.

27:11.420 --> 27:12.450
Sure.

27:21.529 --> 27:23.400
Look at the state of the kitchen.

27:40.410 --> 27:42.049
You're all slacking.

27:43.049 --> 27:44.650
Not paying attention.

27:46.350 --> 27:47.719
When was the last time
you cleaned the kitchen?

27:48.450 --> 27:50.259
We clean it every day.

28:05.569 --> 28:06.569
You clean every day,

28:08.110 --> 28:11.009
- but there's this much grease?
- Well...

28:11.009 --> 28:15.249
We were making omelets for kids.

28:16.219 --> 28:17.249
Omelets?

28:17.749 --> 28:19.549
We were told...

28:19.549 --> 28:22.989
that when families visit,
the kids have nothing to eat.

28:23.319 --> 28:27.329
Pil Gu developed something
called a cloud omelet,

28:27.630 --> 28:30.430
and it's the softest thing
in the world.

28:30.700 --> 28:33.200
These days we have lots of
customers visiting just for that.

28:33.430 --> 28:34.999
Have you reported it
to the HQ development team?

28:36.640 --> 28:38.640
Well...

28:38.640 --> 28:41.769
I was going to once I finished
honing the recipe.

28:42.569 --> 28:43.579
Then...

28:44.539 --> 28:47.549
You've been selling food
that's not even finished?

28:50.249 --> 28:51.279
Hey.

28:51.779 --> 28:53.590
What's the point of running
a franchise then?

28:54.019 --> 28:55.150
Go set up your own.

28:55.789 --> 28:57.559
How many times
do I have to tell you...

28:57.559 --> 29:00.160
that no matter how good
something tastes,

29:00.160 --> 29:01.930
it has to be in the system?

29:03.759 --> 29:05.799
We hold competitions every month,

29:05.799 --> 29:08.600
and the development team
has their idea window open.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.799
Can we really tell the franchisees
to follow the rules...

29:10.799 --> 29:12.640
when the directly managed one
is being run like this?

29:15.009 --> 29:17.039
I'm telling HR about this.
Prepare yourselves.

29:17.039 --> 29:18.809
- No...
- Please...

29:18.809 --> 29:20.049
Nothing.

29:24.920 --> 29:26.650
(Director's Room)

29:33.860 --> 29:34.930
Darn it.

29:38.529 --> 29:40.329
You could have just warned them.

29:40.329 --> 29:43.140
Going to HR was a bit much.

29:43.969 --> 29:45.039
What?

29:45.239 --> 29:46.340
I'm sorry.

29:47.370 --> 29:49.910
Once there is a hiccup or two,

29:49.910 --> 29:52.110
the whole system can
come down in a second.

29:52.279 --> 29:53.950
You have to get it right
from the start.

29:59.049 --> 30:01.620
- What is it?
- The Netherlands remittance case.

30:02.249 --> 30:03.259
The Netherlands?

30:03.690 --> 30:06.329
The private detective
for the watch thief.

30:08.989 --> 30:10.960
Oh, right. That.

30:11.729 --> 30:14.630
Have you forgotten about it? You?

30:15.029 --> 30:16.569
That watch worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars?

30:19.670 --> 30:20.769
Aren't you going to approve it?

30:22.340 --> 30:23.440
No.

30:23.779 --> 30:25.940
It's not even Korea. I'll just be
wasting money trying to find it.

30:26.309 --> 30:29.819
Tell the detective
from the Netherlands to drop it.

30:29.819 --> 30:32.519
How can I tell him to quit
after giving him so much money?

30:32.519 --> 30:34.450
Let's just forget about it.

30:34.450 --> 30:35.519
What's next?

30:36.049 --> 30:37.120
Then...

30:38.120 --> 30:39.729
should I call Interpol?

30:39.729 --> 30:40.829
Interpol?

30:40.960 --> 30:43.029
She could be an international criminal.

30:43.029 --> 30:44.900
One who targets
and steals from Koreans.

30:45.200 --> 30:48.170
With those people,
you have to put them in jail...

30:48.170 --> 30:49.499
and make them serve time.

30:49.499 --> 30:50.999
Just drop it!

30:51.370 --> 30:54.140
You're heartless!

31:04.479 --> 31:07.120
Who's calling who heartless?

31:10.289 --> 31:11.319
Wait.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.960
He's never the type to quit.

31:18.040 --> 31:21.710
You have to get used to being rejected
to do this job well.

31:25.239 --> 31:26.269
Jae Soo.

31:28.370 --> 31:29.370
Da Li?

31:30.440 --> 31:32.210
What are you doing at my company?

31:32.440 --> 31:34.549
I'm so glad I ran into you.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.450
I'm here to recruit patrons,
but I'm in a bit of a pickle.

31:38.450 --> 31:39.590
There seems to be
a misunderstanding.

31:39.850 --> 31:42.150
- Can you help me look into...
- What a bunch of beggars.

31:43.559 --> 31:44.620
What?

31:44.620 --> 31:47.890
I heard Si Hyung has also been
running around asking for money.

31:48.660 --> 31:50.430
Now you too?

31:52.360 --> 31:55.499
Don't bother these
hard-working people.

31:56.100 --> 31:59.340
Earn your own money.

32:00.009 --> 32:02.769
Or just be honest
and ask me to lend you some.

32:03.910 --> 32:05.610
An exhibit? As if.

32:08.079 --> 32:10.079
Is your company really doing okay?

32:12.219 --> 32:13.219
What?

32:13.789 --> 32:16.960
To have someone who doesn't even
understand cultural marketing lead.

32:17.719 --> 32:19.019
I'm worried.

32:19.729 --> 32:20.729
Oh, one more thing.

32:21.989 --> 32:24.529
You said you borrowed money
from your sister, right?

32:30.340 --> 32:32.700
No, I didn't!

32:33.269 --> 32:35.539
Now that her family is done for,
she talks with no manners!

32:35.539 --> 32:36.539
It doesn't even make sense.

32:36.539 --> 32:38.640
Go! We have stuff to do!

32:38.640 --> 32:41.009
Forget this nonsense, and let's go.

32:48.620 --> 32:50.989
What happened to
Im Seung Yeon's schedule?

32:50.989 --> 32:53.090
We're still adjusting it.

32:54.190 --> 32:56.559
Secure it within six hours.

32:56.700 --> 32:57.729
Okay.

33:00.529 --> 33:01.829
You did something to your face,
didn't you?

33:02.370 --> 33:03.370
Excuse me?

33:03.370 --> 33:05.140
Everyone's face has gone dry...

33:05.140 --> 33:06.809
because of all the overtime work
we've been doing lately.

33:06.809 --> 33:09.269
My wrinkles have deepened.

33:09.509 --> 33:13.210
But you. Your face is glowing.

33:14.680 --> 33:15.680
What is it?

33:16.009 --> 33:18.019
Is it the "glowy skin" routine...

33:18.019 --> 33:20.519
that a lot of celebrities
are doing these days?

33:20.519 --> 33:22.289
No, I haven't done anything.

33:22.289 --> 33:23.960
I've spent the nights here, too.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.960
I guess being young is great.

33:47.479 --> 33:49.509
I'm keeping this a secret.

34:02.360 --> 34:03.559
Hello.

34:07.269 --> 34:08.569
Hello?

34:09.600 --> 34:10.799
Excuse me!

34:14.069 --> 34:15.509
A cup of iced Americano, please.

34:15.739 --> 34:16.940
That'll be ten dollars.

34:16.940 --> 34:19.139
- Excuse me?
- That will be ten dollars.

34:19.309 --> 34:22.273
How is a cup of iced Americano...
Excuse me. Wait.

34:22.650 --> 34:24.248
Fine.

34:25.746 --> 34:26.888
Give me a break.

34:29.187 --> 34:30.726
Can I get a cash receipt?

34:31.687 --> 34:32.857
Input your number.

34:40.167 --> 34:43.937
Do they sprinkle gold dust on top?
How is it ten dollars?

34:48.877 --> 34:51.047
(An Chak Hee)

34:51.047 --> 34:52.547
(My face after staying up
for two nights.)

34:52.547 --> 34:53.777
(We all stayed up all night,
and I got scolded.)

34:53.777 --> 34:55.678
What's the matter with her now?

34:55.678 --> 34:57.488
(Because I'm the only one who glows.
Is it a crime to be pretty?)

34:57.488 --> 34:58.547
Gosh.

35:17.308 --> 35:19.937
Why is there a bent chair?
This chair is bent.

35:34.587 --> 35:36.528
What are your daily sales?

35:37.988 --> 35:39.857
They vary every day.

35:40.297 --> 35:42.857
Do people who are not here
for the gallery even buy coffee?

35:43.328 --> 35:44.727
Well, that's...

35:45.497 --> 35:46.667
Where's the owner?

35:47.638 --> 35:48.997
He rarely comes to work.

36:00.218 --> 36:02.477
Here. Drink this.

36:02.747 --> 36:03.848
Thank you.

36:07.618 --> 36:08.917
Goodness.

36:11.258 --> 36:14.497
Well, I understand Chairman Choi.

36:15.258 --> 36:17.727
I had no idea Director Noh
would think that way.

36:19.598 --> 36:23.067
Director Kim officiated...

36:23.067 --> 36:24.538
his son's wedding...

36:24.808 --> 36:26.977
and helped him
when he was going bankrupt.

36:26.977 --> 36:29.707
How could he turn against you
when it hasn't been that long...

36:29.707 --> 36:31.348
since Director Kim passed away?

36:33.047 --> 36:36.647
I'm sorry that I can't be of help.

36:36.817 --> 36:38.848
Oh, don't be.

36:40.758 --> 36:43.118
By the way, this is a problem.

36:45.058 --> 36:47.698
Why don't we just get Segi...

36:52.267 --> 36:54.897
Never mind. It's nothing.

37:04.047 --> 37:06.247
Look at the time.

37:06.508 --> 37:09.747
I have to relieve
my mother's caregiver.

37:10.647 --> 37:12.218
I'll get going.

37:12.348 --> 37:14.687
Okay. Good work today.

37:14.687 --> 37:15.788
Sure.

37:53.957 --> 37:59.397
(Tae Jin)

38:12.448 --> 38:15.448
Do we have to socialize
even at dinner?

38:15.678 --> 38:17.448
We're not even that close.

38:17.988 --> 38:20.087
On the outside,
it's part of socializing.

38:20.087 --> 38:21.857
But people from the Ministry of Economy
and Finance will be there...

38:21.857 --> 38:23.558
and the American Embassy.

38:23.828 --> 38:25.187
You have to attend today.

38:26.828 --> 38:28.098
Don't I look too old?

38:28.928 --> 38:31.227
You look perfect for socializing.

38:36.667 --> 38:39.368
(Da Li)

38:43.578 --> 38:46.578
Hey, Da Li. Yes, go ahead.

38:51.247 --> 38:53.047
Yes. I have time.

38:54.017 --> 38:55.087
Yes.

38:56.457 --> 38:57.828
I don't have anything in particular.

38:58.988 --> 39:00.857
I'm nearby. That's good.

39:01.357 --> 39:02.428
See you.

39:04.528 --> 39:05.897
Let's go to Seongbuk-dong.

39:06.497 --> 39:07.538
Pardon?

39:23.078 --> 39:24.118
Hi.

39:28.357 --> 39:29.888
Am I late?

39:31.457 --> 39:34.127
No, I arrived early.
I was nearby, as I said.

39:36.868 --> 39:38.267
You can bring us the food now.

39:44.437 --> 39:46.638
I just ordered it on my own.
Is that all right?

39:47.377 --> 39:48.408
Of course.

40:18.538 --> 40:19.607
Why aren't you eating well?

40:19.607 --> 40:20.908
You like yellow corvina dried in barley.

40:23.578 --> 40:24.848
I'm eating.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.647
Should I have ordered grilled deodeok?

40:30.747 --> 40:32.247
Braised croaker is also good nowadays.

40:38.357 --> 40:40.127
I said I was eating.

40:40.457 --> 40:41.698
You should have some too.

40:45.397 --> 40:46.468
Okay.

40:55.607 --> 40:57.848
I stepped over the line
at the department store.

40:59.678 --> 41:01.678
You were only caring about me.

41:05.888 --> 41:07.587
Thank you for saying that.

41:12.158 --> 41:13.428
You know,

41:14.758 --> 41:15.857
I...

41:16.928 --> 41:17.928
Yes?

41:19.567 --> 41:20.667
Well,

41:24.267 --> 41:25.508
it's...

41:29.337 --> 41:30.508
What is it?

41:33.948 --> 41:36.247
I wanted to...

41:44.788 --> 41:46.158
thank you.

41:48.928 --> 41:49.997
What?

41:50.968 --> 41:52.368
I wanted to thank you...

41:52.368 --> 41:55.167
for helping me with everything
during the funeral.

42:02.837 --> 42:04.247
Is that so hard to say?

42:06.578 --> 42:08.848
I guess I have a lot of things
to thank you for.

42:09.317 --> 42:10.988
It's tough to say it.

42:18.587 --> 42:20.897
So are we behind all of it now?

42:21.997 --> 42:22.997
What?

42:24.198 --> 42:27.198
I know we can't go back
to how things were, but I want to...

42:30.238 --> 42:31.337
What I'm saying is...

42:33.368 --> 42:36.078
that I want us to go back
to how we understood each other.

42:40.678 --> 42:42.778
I won't expect anything from you
right now.

42:43.618 --> 42:46.517
I merely want you to stop thinking
that you're left alone.

42:46.718 --> 42:50.017
When you're upset, feeling victimized,
or having a hard time,

42:51.488 --> 42:53.388
and when you're in need of help,

42:55.227 --> 42:57.698
I'll be right by your side.

43:02.297 --> 43:03.337
All right?

43:12.508 --> 43:13.948
Why aren't you answering me?

43:14.848 --> 43:15.877
Do you understand?

43:17.218 --> 43:18.247
Yes.

43:33.868 --> 43:36.797
(Kim Nak Chun)

45:11.007 --> 45:12.976
(Dad, I'm sorry. I fell asleep.)

45:12.976 --> 45:14.677
(I had breakfast, so don't nag me!)

45:14.677 --> 45:16.376
(Is it lunch, not breakfast? No.
It's past 5 p.m., so it's dinner.)

45:16.376 --> 45:18.586
(You must be busy.
You're not even checking my messages.)

45:20.146 --> 45:21.246
What are you doing?

45:24.617 --> 45:26.226
My feet really hurt.

45:28.460 --> 45:30.389
I walked all day.

45:33.156 --> 45:34.455
I should've exercised...

45:36.529 --> 45:38.960
just like you said I should.

45:43.873 --> 45:45.033
Did you eat?

45:48.573 --> 45:49.714
Isn't this funny?

45:51.413 --> 45:54.214
This is something you used to say
to me all the time.

45:59.384 --> 46:00.623
I ate.

46:03.093 --> 46:05.053
I had yellow corvina dried in barley...

46:07.194 --> 46:09.294
and salted oysters with hot peppers.

46:12.663 --> 46:15.504
I even had your favorite,
braised silver pomfret.

46:18.904 --> 46:20.604
The braised silver pomfret
was a bit salty.

46:22.774 --> 46:26.013
Let's not go there next time.

46:30.984 --> 46:32.123
Next time...

47:16.763 --> 47:18.904
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you.

47:19.163 --> 47:21.834
We didn't want to store it,

47:21.834 --> 47:23.473
but we couldn't bring ourselves
to throw it out.

47:30.013 --> 47:32.073
It's where I put drawings in
as a kid.

47:36.614 --> 47:38.413
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

48:17.524 --> 48:19.723
You have such distinct features,

48:19.723 --> 48:21.064
so this jacket is perfect for you.

48:21.964 --> 48:24.993
Instead of this, do you have
anything that's elegant?

48:25.864 --> 48:27.604
Something that's luxurious
and dignified.

48:27.604 --> 48:29.834
You never liked anything
like that before.

48:29.834 --> 48:31.504
You always looked for pieces...

48:31.504 --> 48:33.104
that shouted,
"I'm a designer brand."

48:33.504 --> 48:34.643
When did I do that?

48:35.573 --> 48:37.073
Then...

48:39.044 --> 48:40.214
Welcome.

48:46.154 --> 48:48.783
Can I sell this too?

48:55.493 --> 48:57.134
You want to sell this?

48:58.064 --> 48:59.104
Yes.

48:59.504 --> 49:01.433
What about this style?

49:01.564 --> 49:03.234
An idol singer wore this,

49:03.234 --> 49:04.933
and we bought it for cheap.

49:04.933 --> 49:07.143
It's avant-garde and elegant,
and it's perfect...

52:26.803 --> 52:29.614
I thought you were working late,
but you're here having a drink.

52:34.243 --> 52:35.484
Mr. Jin.

52:36.484 --> 52:37.553
Gosh.

52:38.214 --> 52:40.524
I just... So...

52:43.123 --> 52:44.323
Did you cry?

52:46.064 --> 52:47.893
No, I didn't cry.

52:48.694 --> 52:49.763
Yes, you did.

52:50.134 --> 52:52.604
What's wrong?
Why are you here alone crying?

52:52.933 --> 52:54.604
I'm not crying.

52:55.533 --> 52:57.274
Gosh.

52:58.203 --> 52:59.243
Here.

53:02.714 --> 53:06.214
If you didn't cry, did you yawn?

53:08.314 --> 53:10.254
Lysozyme...

53:11.283 --> 53:13.754

are trying to prevent...

53:13.754 --> 53:15.354
bacterial activities.

53:16.493 --> 53:18.053
Lyso... What?

53:18.323 --> 53:21.964
People say that tears are the fruit
of people's emotions.

53:22.163 --> 53:23.593
But the truth is...

53:25.334 --> 53:28.663
that they are more helpful
in protecting our eyes.

53:29.973 --> 53:31.734
So without tears,

53:31.734 --> 53:33.703
your eye health will deteriorate,

53:33.703 --> 53:35.373
and your eyes will also get dry.

53:37.044 --> 53:38.913
And your eyesight
will get worse too.

53:39.643 --> 53:42.283
Anyway, it'll be bad in many ways.

53:43.854 --> 53:46.323
So are you telling me
that you were trying...

53:46.323 --> 53:49.493
to squeeze out tears
to protect your eyes?

53:49.493 --> 53:50.623
Yes.

53:51.593 --> 53:52.794
Something like that.

53:54.064 --> 53:56.533
Fine. Let's say I believe you.

54:00.004 --> 54:02.674
How did you find me here?

54:10.873 --> 54:12.544
I said that I was on the board...

54:12.544 --> 54:14.843
for the restaurant
business association.

54:15.183 --> 54:17.053
So sometimes,
I conduct inspections like this one...

54:17.053 --> 54:18.814
to make sure the kitchens are clean.

54:19.254 --> 54:20.654
I'm like a secret inspector.

54:21.084 --> 54:23.493
I see. A secret inspector.

54:23.493 --> 54:24.493
Yes.

54:28.723 --> 54:30.093
What's that?

54:30.564 --> 54:32.703
Don't tell me you're skipping town.

54:33.753 --> 54:35.414
I sold my house.

54:37.684 --> 54:41.193
But I won't be able to pay back
your money even with that.

54:41.954 --> 54:43.523
Then where are you going to stay?

54:46.534 --> 54:49.164
Well, it's none of my business.

54:52.534 --> 54:55.334
You sold the house
without finding a house to move to?

54:57.943 --> 55:01.314
I should probably stay at a hotel.

55:01.474 --> 55:02.814
For the time being.

55:05.213 --> 55:07.153
You want to go to a hotel
even when you're broke.

55:18.793 --> 55:20.293
She's not crying.

55:20.894 --> 55:22.394
She's protecting her eyes.

55:22.394 --> 55:24.003
That's right.

55:36.883 --> 55:40.713
Listen. You are smart
and well-educated.

55:41.084 --> 55:43.923
It looked like you had a nice job
in the Netherlands.

55:44.323 --> 55:46.293
Didn't you think
about selling everything...

55:46.293 --> 55:47.894
and just leaving?

55:49.153 --> 55:52.593
I heard selling the gallery would
give you a big sum of money.

55:57.434 --> 55:59.133
You startled me.

55:59.974 --> 56:01.573
You money-grubber.

56:01.773 --> 56:04.374
What did you say? "Money-grubber"?

56:04.573 --> 56:08.474
Can you sell your father?

56:09.173 --> 56:10.543
What are you talking about?

56:10.543 --> 56:13.554
I get that you love money.

56:15.284 --> 56:17.184
So will you sell your father?

56:17.784 --> 56:20.994
- Why are we talking about that now?
- The gallery is my father.

56:21.894 --> 56:23.264
That's my father.

56:25.124 --> 56:26.193
I see.

56:26.564 --> 56:28.693
Without the gallery,

56:28.693 --> 56:32.463
where would people like you
enjoy art?

56:33.804 --> 56:35.104
People like me?

56:35.104 --> 56:37.304
There has to be a gallery...

56:37.903 --> 56:41.744
for people like you
who don't know about da Vinci...

56:42.244 --> 56:44.613
to be able to admire art.

56:48.713 --> 56:49.983
Poor people.

56:51.224 --> 56:52.823
Uneducated people.

56:53.793 --> 56:56.793
People with some money.

56:57.664 --> 56:59.664
Without the gallery,

56:59.664 --> 57:01.934
they can only look at art
through books.

57:02.064 --> 57:03.164
Why?

57:03.564 --> 57:06.073
Because rich people...

57:08.403 --> 57:11.173
are probably just like you.

57:11.543 --> 57:13.843
They won't sell their artwork
at decent prices.

57:14.914 --> 57:18.343
A lot of people...

57:19.454 --> 57:21.514
will hide...

57:22.113 --> 57:25.084
the artwork in their art storage...

57:25.923 --> 57:28.554
and won't share it
with other people.

57:30.863 --> 57:32.394
Did you get that?

57:33.293 --> 57:35.994
You money-grubber who doesn't
even know who da Vinci is.

57:50.543 --> 57:52.983
At least,
you're a handsome money-grubber.

58:00.224 --> 58:01.653
That's what...

58:04.323 --> 58:06.434
my dad...

58:07.664 --> 58:09.463
told me.

58:13.503 --> 58:14.934
Mr. Jin.

58:15.474 --> 58:17.543
Just stick to one thing.

58:17.543 --> 58:19.843
You can either drop the honorifics
or keep them.

58:20.673 --> 58:22.073
Do you think...

58:23.744 --> 58:25.514
I can do it?

58:27.414 --> 58:28.854
Do you think...

58:30.523 --> 58:31.923
I can...

58:33.093 --> 58:34.994
protect the gallery?

58:43.003 --> 58:44.204
No.

58:50.474 --> 58:52.443
You might have a shot
with my help, though.

59:09.923 --> 59:11.764
I have a car over there.
Let me drive you.

59:11.764 --> 59:13.164
I didn't drink.

in Samseong-dong, right?

59:30.443 --> 59:31.543
Is it not?

01:00:25.403 --> 01:00:27.673
Where are we?

01:00:31.343 --> 01:00:32.543
I'm good now.

01:00:33.314 --> 01:00:34.843
You should go home.

01:00:35.843 --> 01:00:38.343
Since I'm here,
I'll escort you to your room.

01:00:38.343 --> 01:00:40.153
Even if you're at a hotel,
you're alone.

01:00:41.113 --> 01:00:43.753
It's all right!

01:00:43.753 --> 01:00:44.983
Mr. Jin.

01:00:50.724 --> 01:00:51.994
I'm sorry.

01:00:52.693 --> 01:00:54.494
I didn't think that far.

01:00:55.293 --> 01:00:57.164
Okay. You should go.

01:00:57.434 --> 01:00:59.233
Thank you. Bye.

01:01:12.343 --> 01:01:13.753

01:01:24.564 --> 01:01:25.994
Yes. Hold on.

01:01:31.003 --> 01:01:32.064
There.

01:01:38.704 --> 01:01:40.874
Right. You accept the membership
points from my phone carrier, right?

01:01:47.514 --> 01:01:50.983
Do you know the lady that just
checked in? The one with curly hair.

01:01:50.983 --> 01:01:54.293
Oh, her. She didn't check-in.

01:01:54.923 --> 01:01:55.923
What?

01:01:56.124 --> 01:01:58.764
She asked me
where the back door was.

01:01:58.764 --> 01:02:00.293
And she left that way.

01:02:04.164 --> 01:02:06.133

No, I don't.

- That's an invasion of privacy.

You've never heard
of the Cheongsong Gallery?

01:05:26.573 --> 01:05:28.874

behind my back?

and pathetic I am.
