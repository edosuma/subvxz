WEBVTT

00:09.642 --> 00:15.581
This is Armed Forces Radio
London, invasion at last.

00:15.582 --> 00:19.752
Allied armies assault enemy held
France from sea and skies

00:19.753 --> 00:23.691
smashing onto the Nazi held
beaches of Normandy.

00:25.392 --> 00:29.862
A vast air armada of allied
paratroopers and gliders invade

00:29.863 --> 00:33.799
Holland from the skies to free
the desperate Dutch people from

00:33.800 --> 00:36.835
the clutches of their
Nazis masters.

00:36.836 --> 00:38.771
Thousands of Hollanders pour

00:38.772 --> 00:43.577
onto the roads and streets to
greet the allied liberators.

00:45.478 --> 00:50.616
Fighting desperately rifle to
rifle, American GI's repel and

00:50.617 --> 00:54.119
destroy a massive
German panzer army.

00:54.120 --> 00:58.490
General Patton's tanks rush in
from the South destroying Nazi

00:58.491 --> 01:03.364
forces and rescuing our boys
trapped behind enemy lines.

01:05.532 --> 01:09.568
American shock troops capture
the Ludendorff Bridge and race

01:09.569 --> 01:12.938
over the Rhine river, slashing
deep into the heart land

01:12.939 --> 01:15.140
of Nazi Germany.

01:15.141 --> 01:19.578
Entire American tank divisions
fan out against ever weakening

01:19.579 --> 01:23.816
enemy resistance, as Russian
troops assaulted his underground

01:23.817 --> 01:27.719
headquarters, Adolph Hitler took
his own life rather then

01:27.720 --> 01:30.557
being captured alive.

01:31.724 --> 01:34.159
Nazi Germany
teeters on surrender

01:34.160 --> 01:36.495
as the Fatherland crumbles.

01:36.496 --> 01:40.666
Hundreds of thousands of the
captured enemy clog the roads as

01:40.667 --> 01:44.503
the furious allied
onslaught races forward.

01:44.504 --> 01:48.874
Our frontline combat soldiers
battle their way deep into enemy

01:48.875 --> 01:52.911
territory followed by an endless
bucket brigade of support

01:52.912 --> 01:57.683
troopers who roll on day and
night keeping our fighting boys

01:57.684 --> 02:00.986
brimming with bullets,
boots and bread.

02:00.987 --> 02:05.157
The expanding gap between the
frontline spearhead and the

02:05.158 --> 02:08.193
critical rear guard a vast
moonscape of wrecked

02:08.193 --> 02:11.997
battle debris and enemy
dead is a no man's land

02:11.998 --> 02:15.736
our GI's have nicknamed,
"The Void,"

02:16.769 --> 02:21.708
this is Armed
Forces Radio London.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.852
That rain is really coming down.

02:33.853 --> 02:34.855
You got them?

02:35.789 --> 02:37.891
Dead in my sight.
It's a kill shot.

02:39.526 --> 02:40.794
What's McConkie saying?

02:41.961 --> 02:44.330
Still waiting for him to
give us the go ahead.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.868
This waiting game is killing me.

02:50.303 --> 02:51.637
We have to be patient.

02:51.638 --> 02:54.306
Company command wants us to wait
to engage the enemy

02:54.307 --> 02:55.834
till they give us the signal.

03:01.881 --> 03:04.918
It's stuffy in here we need
some fresh air.

03:06.219 --> 03:07.520
Sarge?

03:07.521 --> 03:11.323
Relax Simms you haven't had a
bath in a week,

03:11.324 --> 03:13.226
consider it a blessing.

03:16.663 --> 03:17.663
Roger that.

03:18.389 --> 03:21.600
McConkie wants us to wait 'til
it's completely dark out there,

03:21.601 --> 03:23.654
then he will give us
the signal to fire.

03:24.270 --> 03:25.572
Mitchell?

03:26.762 --> 03:27.973
Mitchell are you ready?

03:27.974 --> 03:32.711
I'm good... and ready to move.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.746
Seek, strike, destroy.

03:34.747 --> 03:37.117
Seek, strike, destroy.

03:57.704 --> 04:00.272
Do you know why I've
brought you out here?

04:00.273 --> 04:03.210
We have a problem that needs
to be discussed.

04:04.611 --> 04:13.752
This morning three men tried to
escape, two of them were shot.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.690
Someone helped these
men to get out.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.160
I want to know,

04:22.762 --> 04:23.931
by whom.

04:40.913 --> 04:46.653
I do not tolerate this kind of
behavior in my stalag.

04:49.722 --> 04:53.325
Next time I will not be
so forgiving.

04:53.326 --> 04:57.898
Do not doubt me, there
will be no escape.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.333
Copy that out.

05:02.668 --> 05:05.837
McConkie has given the command
to engage, fire when ready.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.673
- Ready?
- Clear

05:07.674 --> 05:08.742
On the way.

05:32.365 --> 05:33.834
Come on.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.125
Sergeant Atwood,

06:00.126 --> 06:02.763
McConkie wants to see you and
Whitaker right away.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.198
Max.

06:13.473 --> 06:15.140
She's slowly dying on you.

06:15.141 --> 06:16.176
She'll make it.

06:17.644 --> 06:21.813
I bet you if I asked her nice and
she'd take me all the wayback to Pocatello.

06:21.814 --> 06:23.817
Or you can trade her in
for a new one.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.821
Now those are fighting words.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.889
Don't talk about my
lady like that.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.158
What? Do you think you can
take me pops?

06:33.159 --> 06:36.027
Any day of the week, and
twice on Sunday?

06:36.028 --> 06:38.198
Oh yeah, what'cha
going to do grandpa?

06:39.465 --> 06:41.571
Oh, and you missed,
what'cha going to do?

06:44.504 --> 06:47.773
Look at that I got
Nelson in a Nelson.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.041
I'm sorry.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.910
Don't apologize to me
apologize to the lady.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.912
- I'm sorry ma'am.
- Its miss.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.014
I'm sorry miss, that was very
rude of me to say and

06:56.015 --> 06:57.549
it won't happen again.

06:57.550 --> 07:02.087
Hey, knock it off enough of the
horse play we got to get moving.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.456
All right, all right.

07:04.457 --> 07:08.059
Don't mess with Ramrod,
Ping Pong.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.730
Good advice.

07:22.642 --> 07:25.977
Atwood, Whitaker we need the two
of you to do a little of hit and

07:25.978 --> 07:27.979
run for our boys up
in Braunlage.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.949
Atwood you are going to be
acting sergeant on this one.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.984
Baker company is having a little
bit of trouble with some

07:32.985 --> 07:35.220
stubborn Germans here on the
east side of the village.

07:35.221 --> 07:39.224
Can't they just get the...
mayor?

07:39.225 --> 07:40.659
Bürgermeister?

07:40.660 --> 07:43.862
Yeah, Bürgermeister to convince him
that the war is basically over?

07:43.863 --> 07:46.663
Well, they tried but they shot him and
this is just a little pocket of resistance

07:46.863 --> 07:48.333
that Vsomehow slipped through the cracks.

07:48.334 --> 07:50.836
I need you guys to go in there
shake'm up a little bit.

07:50.837 --> 07:53.238
Do you want us to take any infantry
or security boys with us sir?

07:53.239 --> 07:56.074
No the two M18s will suffice.

07:56.075 --> 07:57.509
We can leave right away?

07:57.510 --> 08:00.912
Captain I'm one man short
on my gun team.

08:00.913 --> 08:04.049
The assisting gunner got his hand
caught behind the breach this morning.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.217
Shattered his wrist.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.585
Any available replacements?

08:06.586 --> 08:09.087
No you will just going to have to
make due for the next few days.

08:09.088 --> 08:10.422
What about Nelson?

08:10.423 --> 08:13.058
He knows the drill we could
promote him, move to

08:13.059 --> 08:14.293
loader on your team.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.894
That's a good solution
let's go with that.

08:15.895 --> 08:18.263
You know with Hitler being dead
and Russians taking Berlin this

08:18.264 --> 08:20.332
might be the last bit of
action you boys see.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.001
This whole thing is going to be
over in a week mark my words.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.270
I don't want anyone to die
today, so by the book.

08:25.271 --> 08:26.805
Yes sir.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.724
And General Allen is going
to be coming forward today

08:28.726 --> 08:30.642
I want the both of you back
here for the General's visit.

08:30.643 --> 08:33.344
We'll take care of the issue in
Braunlage and we'll get right back.

08:33.345 --> 08:35.145
Excellent thank you
gentlemen dismissed.

08:35.147 --> 08:36.881
Sir.

08:36.883 --> 08:38.417
- Atwood.
- Yes sir.

08:38.418 --> 08:41.086
Tell Simms that was a heck of a
shot last night, guard tower

08:41.087 --> 08:44.322
2600 yards it's got to be
some kind of record.

08:44.323 --> 08:46.059
I'll let him know
you're pleased.

08:53.332 --> 08:54.868
Avenging Angel.

08:56.602 --> 08:57.836
Hey what are you doing?

08:57.837 --> 09:00.105
Hey Simms. I like that
that's a good name.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.573
Simms.

09:01.574 --> 09:02.641
You know I saw one the other day
you are going to love this,

09:02.642 --> 09:05.110
these boys named their
Hellcat...

09:05.111 --> 09:08.146
Hey. Why don't you get
back to work?

09:08.147 --> 09:11.149
Driving trucks,
shining shoes I don't care...

09:11.150 --> 09:12.953
just stay away from my Hellcat.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.134
Do you understand you're
not welcomed here.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.394
What are your deaf?

09:22.361 --> 09:23.997
Go on leave.

09:39.946 --> 09:42.714
Looking like Corporal Cracker
there taking a liking in you.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.451
Yeah he is a real charmer.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.987
You'd think that being out here fighting
against the greatest race haters in the world

09:49.187 --> 09:51.490
we wouldn't still be having
this problem in the US of A.

09:53.203 --> 09:56.361
It's called irony or hypocrisy
depending on which side of the

09:56.362 --> 09:58.064
boarder you're on.

09:59.165 --> 10:02.100
Colored don't need
drinking fountains...

10:02.101 --> 10:03.680
that's how it was when we left

10:04.604 --> 10:07.131
and that's how it's
going to be when we get back,

10:10.343 --> 10:13.080
somebody told me you used to
drive one of them tanks.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.951
Well somebody told you wrong,
M18 isn't a tank, it's a tank destroyer,

10:18.985 --> 10:21.087
I was a Hellcat
commander for two years.

10:22.221 --> 10:24.274
You got to have some good
stories I bet?

10:25.391 --> 10:29.194
Good stories, I got some of
those, got some not so

10:29.195 --> 10:30.997
good ones as well.

10:32.398 --> 10:35.166
Now they got you driving trucks?

10:35.167 --> 10:38.370
They busted us down at the
service unit three months ago,

10:38.371 --> 10:41.006
General said, and I quote,

10:41.007 --> 10:43.510
"If this battalion was
a horse, I'd shoot it."

10:45.144 --> 10:46.446
It's a long story.

10:49.115 --> 10:50.517
I'm all ears.

10:52.630 --> 10:55.420
Some other time you know let's-
let's get this jimmies

10:55.421 --> 10:56.521
loaded up and moving.

10:56.522 --> 10:58.024
Alright.

10:59.425 --> 11:03.428
Welcome gentlemen to the Owens
Express, watch your heads,

11:03.429 --> 11:08.500
our next schedule stop is HQ,
hot showers, clean beds and

11:08.501 --> 11:10.403
some good grub.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.041
Good morning, good morning?

11:16.042 --> 11:17.476
Where did you get that?

11:17.477 --> 11:20.378
I liberated it; had to get
something for my brother to

11:20.379 --> 11:22.180
prove I was here.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.815
You know they are never going to
let you bring that home.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.285
Never say never.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.685
Did you find any more treasures?

11:27.686 --> 11:30.288
Back at the guards' barracks,
they ditched all kinds of stuff

11:30.289 --> 11:32.190
before they high tailed
it out of here.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.292
Talking about treasures-

11:34.293 --> 11:35.760
Found some of those
dime novels you love,

11:35.761 --> 11:37.397
I want your cigarettes.

11:42.301 --> 11:43.835
Here you go.

11:43.836 --> 11:46.304
Seriously, how was that
a fair trade?

11:46.305 --> 11:48.339
He doesn't smoke he reads,
what's the problem?

11:48.340 --> 11:50.508
You ever heard of a highway
robbery, that stack a toilet

11:50.509 --> 11:52.577
paper you got there is
maybe worth one pack.

11:52.578 --> 11:54.345
Those are hard to find.

11:54.346 --> 11:56.414
It's okay what I'm I going
to do with smokes?

11:56.415 --> 11:59.052
See its all copacetic.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.252
Thanks Danny Boy.

12:01.253 --> 12:03.088
Don't call me that.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.356
- It's your nickname.
- I don't want a nickname.

12:05.357 --> 12:09.094
Everyone's got a nickname,
Nelson is Ping Pong,

12:09.095 --> 12:11.431
Simms is Judy-
- Hold on Judy?

12:12.398 --> 12:14.300
Yeah your first name is Carey,

12:15.868 --> 12:17.137
Carey Grant.

12:18.204 --> 12:20.371
I'm sorry I'm not
following this at all.

12:20.372 --> 12:22.308
Judy! Judy! Judy!

12:23.409 --> 12:25.376
He said it in
"Bringing Up Baby".

12:25.377 --> 12:29.114
No! No! No! You are getting that
confused with Larry Storch the

12:29.115 --> 12:32.217
comedian who does the impression
of Carey Grant with Judy Garland

12:32.218 --> 12:33.353
in the stage show.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.187
Susan! Susan! Susan!

12:35.188 --> 12:38.256
That's what Carey Grant
said in "Bringing Up Baby".

12:38.257 --> 12:39.391
Exactly.
Thank you.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.827
Okay I'm fine with
calling him Susan.

12:42.828 --> 12:45.463
Ping Pong, you are being
promoted to loader on Max's team

12:45.464 --> 12:48.333
until we find a replacement for
Kelly; get a good system worked

12:48.334 --> 12:49.868
out with your gunner, alright?

12:49.869 --> 12:51.237
No problem Sarge.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.539
We'll show you how a real
gun team works.

12:54.540 --> 12:58.276
Oh yeah, you do that Max,
alright.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.412
Alright everybody McConkie needs
his Hellcats up in Brownlog.

13:01.413 --> 13:07.852
Brownlog? It's a Braunlage,
Braunlage.

13:07.853 --> 13:09.287
You done?

13:09.288 --> 13:12.457
We are not fighting the German
language or the people,

13:12.458 --> 13:14.227
we are fighting the Nazis.

13:15.030 --> 13:17.662
So we need to persuade the
Germans to come out with

13:17.663 --> 13:19.464
their hands up.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.668
We got a lot of work to do.
Lets load up.

13:27.940 --> 13:30.608
Mitchell, I need another two
rounds of armor piercing

13:30.609 --> 13:33.113
- for the ready rack.
- You got it.

13:36.615 --> 13:39.252
Danny!
Get down here!

13:42.855 --> 13:45.256
You want to dig a fox
hole for fun?

13:45.257 --> 13:46.624
No why would I want to do that?

13:46.625 --> 13:49.961
Because you are a numbskull,
I told you yesterday,

13:49.962 --> 13:52.664
"don't smoke around the ammo".

13:52.665 --> 13:54.465
I know I'm sorry I forgot.

13:54.466 --> 13:57.202
You forgot?
He forgot.

13:57.203 --> 13:58.907
How do you forget, you're the loader,

13:59.107 --> 14:01.272
you handle ammo more than
anybody on this crew?

14:01.273 --> 14:02.707
I don't know why I forget,
I just-

14:02.708 --> 14:06.978
Keep it up, and you'll be digging a fox hole
for each man on this team, you got me?

14:06.979 --> 14:07.979
Yes Sarge.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.551
Sometimes I wonder about you.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.920
You don't have to wonder
anymore, it's been confirmed,

14:15.921 --> 14:19.624
Barlow's IQ test results
came back negative.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.327
Here you go Danny Boy.

14:44.483 --> 14:48.536
Sorry for the delay gentlemen but
we are going to finally get you out of here.

14:51.457 --> 14:54.727
Lieutenant, you feeling okay?

14:55.661 --> 14:59.731
I'm fine, just a
little knackered.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.667
So what happened out there?

15:02.668 --> 15:05.570
What did Shonbeck do to you?

15:05.571 --> 15:07.840
Well, that is a long story.

15:08.941 --> 15:10.551
I don't know where he came from,

15:10.751 --> 15:13.468
but he caught us coming up
past a farm of Quedlinburg.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.714
Shonbeck took us
out into the woods,

15:16.715 --> 15:18.751
I was sure he was
going to kill us.

15:36.068 --> 15:42.507
Lieutenant Goss, 12 kilometers
is quite far on foot,

15:42.508 --> 15:45.643
I'm surprised you were not
caught sooner.

15:45.644 --> 15:49.682
Your stolen uniform however
do help I have to admit.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.419
Shall we take a walk gentlemen.

15:56.689 --> 16:00.725
You see the dilemma here is that
there are strict orders to shoot

16:00.726 --> 16:04.429
any enemy soldiers who disguise
themselves as Germans.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.698
Stop here.

16:07.333 --> 16:08.668
Turn around,

16:11.003 --> 16:12.472
kneel down.

16:17.476 --> 16:23.681
My favorite pistol, my father
took it from a British officer

16:23.682 --> 16:27.051
he killed in the great war,
it's much better than

16:27.052 --> 16:28.487
our 9mm Luger.

16:30.122 --> 16:34.592
Do you know why the British
changed from the 455 Webley to

16:34.593 --> 16:36.596
the standard issue Enfield?

16:41.633 --> 16:43.636
Do you lieutenant?

16:44.636 --> 16:46.306
You're British,

16:48.040 --> 16:49.776
perhaps some insight.

16:53.078 --> 16:57.684
No? Neither do I.

16:58.817 --> 17:03.456
It just seem odd to use
the Enfield over the Webley,

17:05.624 --> 17:06.858
such a waste.

17:10.061 --> 17:14.467
There is a game we liked to play
on the Russian front;

17:16.402 --> 17:19.537
whomever is the last
man standing,

17:19.538 --> 17:21.606
well he can be on his
way and run off

17:21.607 --> 17:24.577
into the woods,
whatever he pleases.

17:26.009 --> 17:28.746
It seems like a rather generous
offer considering the

17:28.747 --> 17:30.616
seriousness of your crime.

17:33.419 --> 17:39.524
It's very simple you just put it
to your head, pull the trigger

17:39.525 --> 17:44.931
and then of course if you are
still alive you pass it on.

17:52.638 --> 17:55.375
Go on take it.

17:58.409 --> 18:00.778
I certainly don't want
to be the one to choose

18:00.779 --> 18:02.515
that wouldn't be fair.

18:08.554 --> 18:09.655
Simple.

18:15.861 --> 18:20.865
Now if you don't want to
consider my offer, I can kill

18:20.866 --> 18:24.670
you all now then get back to
more pressing matters.

18:31.677 --> 18:32.879
Very good.

19:29.268 --> 19:30.953
All right Mitchell, move us out.

19:35.974 --> 19:37.743
Mitchell, lets go.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.814
Shhhh, I'm saying a prayer.

19:43.582 --> 19:45.051
Amen Sarge.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.019
Amen.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.194
What's going on?

20:30.195 --> 20:33.297
German blew a hydro dam last
night flood the whole area.

20:33.298 --> 20:35.866
We got the engineers up there
looking for needed repairs.

20:35.867 --> 20:37.268
So what about the rest
of our trucks?

20:37.269 --> 20:39.904
We let them risk it all but the
last track that crossed.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.072
It got caught up in something

20:41.073 --> 20:42.907
tipped over the
bridge into the river,

20:42.908 --> 20:44.409
luckily no one died.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.377
It is going to take most of the
day to repair that bridge.

20:46.378 --> 20:47.679
So what do we do?

20:47.680 --> 20:50.881
You, you need to take
520 to St. Andreasberg,

20:50.882 --> 20:52.617
they got a bailey
bridge up there where

20:52.618 --> 20:53.618
you can cross.

20:53.619 --> 20:54.885
And how far is that?

20:54.886 --> 20:56.220
20 miles, take you an hour.

20:56.221 --> 20:58.122
A lot better than
waiting around here

20:58.123 --> 20:59.659
for who knows how long.

21:00.392 --> 21:01.694
Thanks.

21:02.750 --> 21:03.961
Hey what's the hold up.

21:03.962 --> 21:05.884
We are going to take
the alternate route

21:05.886 --> 21:08.308
through St. Andreasberg
so into the void we go.

21:09.735 --> 21:13.004
Sorry gentlemen MPs are telling
us the bridge is out so we got

21:13.005 --> 21:14.372
to take a detour.

21:14.373 --> 21:18.409
I don't mind the drive it's
rather pleasant actually.

21:18.410 --> 21:20.945
Lieutenant Goss here on the
other hand I'm not so sure he

21:20.946 --> 21:22.615
likes the potholes.

21:23.649 --> 21:25.544
You can ride upfront if
you want sir.

21:33.925 --> 21:35.127
Lieutenant Goss.

21:36.394 --> 21:39.664
Sergeant Jesse Owens nice to
meet you lieutenant

21:39.665 --> 21:44.101
Jesse Owens as in Olympic gold
medalist Jesse Owens.

21:44.102 --> 21:45.102
You got it.

21:45.795 --> 21:49.006
Well it can't be to shabby being
confused with him I dare say.

21:49.007 --> 21:50.808
He seems like an all right guy.

21:50.809 --> 21:51.709
All right.

21:51.710 --> 21:53.978
The man won three gold medals.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.546
Four gold medals sir.

21:55.547 --> 21:59.417
Four gold medals and he broke a
world record made the Germans

21:59.418 --> 22:01.103
look like a bunch of
old pansies.

22:02.821 --> 22:06.025
I could lap him, let's go.

22:26.812 --> 22:28.781
Danny Boy got any gum?

22:29.515 --> 22:31.482
Not if you are no going
to call me that.

22:31.483 --> 22:33.217
I told you it's your nickname.

22:33.218 --> 22:35.720
I told you I don't
want a nickname.

22:35.721 --> 22:39.123
Tough, that's your nickname you
know like the song,

22:39.124 --> 22:42.426
♪ Oh Danny Boy the pipes,

22:42.427 --> 22:47.498
♪ the pipes are calling
from glen to glen,

22:47.499 --> 22:50.935
♪ and down the mountain side.

22:50.936 --> 22:57.141
♪ The summer's gone,
and all the flowers are dying.

22:57.142 --> 22:59.211
That's an Irish song.

23:01.146 --> 23:06.150
♪ 'Tis you, 'tis you must go
and I must bide.

23:06.151 --> 23:10.087
I'm not Irish and neither
are my ancestors.

23:10.088 --> 23:12.091
Come on give me a piece.

23:18.797 --> 23:19.999
Thanks.

23:22.901 --> 23:31.041
♪ 'Tis I'll be here in
sunshine or in shadow.

23:31.042 --> 23:34.812
♪ Oh Danny Boy,
oh Danny Boy,

23:34.813 --> 23:39.251
♪ I love you so.

23:42.154 --> 23:44.054
Feeling any better sir?

23:44.055 --> 23:47.191
Now that I can see where we
are going, much.

23:47.192 --> 23:50.350
Well since you could see allow
me to give you the grand tour,

23:51.897 --> 23:55.466
welcome to the Void 100 miles of
debris and carnage after our

23:55.467 --> 23:59.537
troops crossed the Rhine they
advanced over 15 miles a day.

23:59.538 --> 24:03.073
These are the leftovers, yeah we
get to go home and the people of

24:03.074 --> 24:07.077
this country get to stand around
and stare at this.

24:07.078 --> 24:08.881
You like driving trucks?

24:10.949 --> 24:14.018
As they say it is better than
riding at the back of the bus

24:14.019 --> 24:17.256
Sorry I'm not familiar
with that saying.

24:18.748 --> 24:22.327
It's what bus drivers said to us,
colored folks back home in America.

24:22.329 --> 24:27.032
"Negros have to ride in the back of
the bus even if the bus is empty."

24:28.233 --> 24:31.837
What kind of rubbish is that, it
hardly seems fair?

24:34.239 --> 24:35.975
I would say so sir.

25:09.608 --> 25:11.911
Back it up!
Back it up!

25:20.318 --> 25:22.988
Gotta move, let's go, lets go.

25:40.005 --> 25:42.339
Take this through
St. Andreasberg.

25:42.340 --> 25:43.641
Sankt Andreasberg.

25:43.642 --> 25:49.313
And then you turn right
along this road here.

25:49.314 --> 25:51.984
Okay got it.

25:53.919 --> 25:56.020
Simms you look forward
to going home?

25:56.021 --> 25:59.123
You know what I'm looking
forward to, nice clean pair of

25:59.124 --> 26:02.326
pajamas, it's going to be nice not
to have to sleep in this anymore.

26:02.327 --> 26:04.194
That does sound good.

26:04.195 --> 26:05.662
I'm worried about etiquette.

26:05.663 --> 26:09.066
I'm going to say or do something
wrong I know it, like forget how

26:09.067 --> 26:12.470
to use a glass and end up drinking straight
out of the milk bottle or something.

26:12.471 --> 26:17.408
The thing you remember when you
get home is that, these are

26:17.409 --> 26:21.178
ladies they ain't like these
French apples so you can't just

26:21.179 --> 26:25.282
walk up to them and say, "how
much?" Try something like,

26:25.283 --> 26:31.055
"lovely day won't you agree?"
Or, "pardon me but have you ever

26:31.056 --> 26:32.990
"seen the Eiffel Tower?"

26:32.991 --> 26:35.928
Yeah then you can ask
them how much?

26:40.365 --> 26:42.001
Is that you?

26:44.235 --> 26:45.669
You stink I'm not joking

26:45.670 --> 26:47.037
It's the K-rations

26:47.038 --> 26:52.476
Well don't eat the K-rations,
the C-rations are safer.

26:52.477 --> 26:55.713
I don't like meat that comes in
a tin, K-rations have this bar

26:55.714 --> 26:58.215
of chocolate in them and it's
cheap and waxy probably

26:58.216 --> 26:59.316
what does it to me.

26:59.317 --> 27:01.053
Then don't eat it.

27:02.253 --> 27:04.388
Maybe it's the D-bars.

27:04.389 --> 27:07.691
You've been eating
D-bars as well?

27:07.692 --> 27:09.593
No wonder you smell like that.

27:09.594 --> 27:11.061
I like sweets.

27:11.062 --> 27:15.199
Well you know what you don't
smell sweet, you better climb in

27:15.200 --> 27:18.235
your fart sack and sleep it off
tonight, no more

27:18.236 --> 27:21.540
K-rations and no D-bars.

27:24.275 --> 27:25.409
He's got a point.

27:25.410 --> 27:28.480
Yeah and so does the end
of my finger...

27:30.181 --> 27:31.951
pull the pin.

27:36.421 --> 27:37.556
Barlow!

27:39.257 --> 27:42.292
The Hellcats weighs like
35,000 pounds.

27:42.293 --> 27:44.294
You should be able to
cross there.

27:44.295 --> 27:47.031
That bailey bridge will hold the
weight of your Hellcats.

27:47.032 --> 27:49.033
All right thanks, good.

27:49.034 --> 27:51.035
Hey Mack, can I buy a bottle
of soda from you?

27:51.036 --> 27:52.171
Sure.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.275
It's quarter.

27:58.276 --> 27:59.176
What?

27:59.177 --> 28:01.111
It's a nickel back at the CP.

28:01.112 --> 28:04.049
Out here, it's a quarter.

28:30.775 --> 28:33.039
I don't think they are
following us anymore.

28:35.413 --> 28:36.948
Cheers.

28:40.819 --> 28:42.287
That's east right?

28:42.754 --> 28:44.089
Yeah.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.391
So if we head that way.

28:47.392 --> 28:50.062
Yeah it will take us back
to the main road.

28:50.795 --> 28:52.064
Yeah.

29:10.281 --> 29:15.486
All right boys listen up, we are
going to take the scenic route.

29:15.487 --> 29:18.489
So we are going to head up to
520 through St. Andreasberg

29:18.490 --> 29:20.392
Sankt Andreasberg.

29:21.392 --> 29:23.656
You just won't leave it alone,
will you Max?

29:25.163 --> 29:27.464
Up through Sankt Andreasberg...

29:27.465 --> 29:29.676
and then we are going
to cross at the river

29:51.189 --> 29:53.659
Lieutenant come look at this.

30:15.914 --> 30:20.484
Let's go up in that tower and
see where we're at right?

30:20.485 --> 30:23.589
Yeah, let's go.

31:21.479 --> 31:25.516
Max, why don't you come up here
and practice your German.

31:43.268 --> 31:46.503
He and his family are their way
to their uncle's farm house.

31:46.504 --> 31:49.773
Simms, search him.

31:49.774 --> 31:52.444
Arms up.

32:01.286 --> 32:04.602
He said, the farmhouse is about
eight kilometers this direction.

32:07.425 --> 32:10.495
Up at the next turn and then
down the little Canyon Road.

32:15.566 --> 32:17.830
It looks like his name is
Frederick Kardoff.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.076
Ask him about the car.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.561
We drove over a big hole a
couple of times-

32:37.789 --> 32:40.357
Something happened and now the
car won't start,

32:40.358 --> 32:41.692
he doesn't know.

32:41.693 --> 32:43.428
See if this matches up.

32:45.563 --> 32:46.632
It was loaded.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.636
Look at his boots, those
are military issue,

32:52.637 --> 32:54.404
he must be deserter,

32:54.405 --> 32:56.090
ditched his uniform
I'm guessing.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.380
- Mitchell?
- Yeah.

33:02.413 --> 33:05.851
Come look at the car; see if you
can get it to work.

33:08.019 --> 33:09.488
I'm a coming.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.858
Who's the girl?

33:17.362 --> 33:19.564
It's his wife Gerta.

33:22.367 --> 33:24.303
His daughter Aunna.

33:25.403 --> 33:27.773
I need some wire,
just give me a second.

33:32.577 --> 33:34.611
- Danny.
- Yeah.

33:34.612 --> 33:35.570
Bring me some K-rations.

33:35.770 --> 33:36.847
What about the 10 and ones?

33:36.848 --> 33:40.417
No, the K-rations, I'm sure
you've got some tucked in

33:40.418 --> 33:41.553
there somewhere.

33:53.798 --> 33:55.600
Yeah, I think I got it.

33:56.601 --> 34:00.103
It's just the linkage
arm to the carburetor,

34:00.104 --> 34:01.840
a little bolt fell off,

34:02.807 --> 34:05.476
that should hold,
have him start it.

34:12.683 --> 34:14.418
This looks fine.

34:32.737 --> 34:33.938
Let him go.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.373
Sergeant, we should report him.

34:36.373 --> 34:38.744
Corporal, I'm letting him go.

34:40.745 --> 34:43.880
Now let's help these
people and be on our way,

34:43.880 --> 34:45.724
Barlow give the
rations to the lady.

35:47.778 --> 35:49.448
Owens.

36:01.626 --> 36:03.593
- Keep an eye on this window.
- Okay.

36:03.594 --> 36:05.437
I'm going to go and
check this room.

36:45.570 --> 36:49.508
Owens, I found a way out.
Come on.

36:52.009 --> 36:53.977
We can get out this way.

36:53.978 --> 36:55.045
Yeah, that's good.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.813
Yeah, help me grab this.

36:56.814 --> 36:57.916
Alright.

36:58.349 --> 36:59.784
Not too heavy.

37:00.251 --> 37:02.087
Shh-shh.

37:02.787 --> 37:04.122
All right you go first.

37:46.831 --> 37:48.131
Owens.

37:48.132 --> 37:50.066
What?

37:50.067 --> 37:51.836
Can you hear that?

37:52.770 --> 37:55.639
Yeah, that's armor coming.

37:55.640 --> 37:56.906
No, don't, don't...

37:56.907 --> 37:58.408
No, no, don't shoot.

37:58.409 --> 37:59.576
Don't move.

37:59.577 --> 38:01.778
You saw us this morning
at the stalag.

38:01.779 --> 38:02.979
Criss-cross.

38:02.980 --> 38:05.086
Shoe lace, the counter
sign is shoe lace.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.261
What are you doing out here?

38:12.657 --> 38:14.759
MPs redirected us up
this road...

38:16.727 --> 38:18.361
we got ambushed, they took out

38:18.362 --> 38:21.600
our trucks with artillery fire,
we lost everybody.

38:22.900 --> 38:26.111
This is Lieutenant Goss and I'm
Sergeant Owens with the 514th.

38:28.005 --> 38:29.608
Let's check it out.

38:32.710 --> 38:35.078
Danny, give the
lieutenant a weapon.

38:35.079 --> 38:36.179
Okay, will do.

38:36.180 --> 38:37.983
Simms, take a 50.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.353
Here you go sir, you've
got a full clip.

38:43.354 --> 38:45.088
Where are these Germans exactly?

38:45.089 --> 38:47.857
They are dug in.
A few kilometers from here.

38:47.858 --> 38:50.161
All right.
Lead the way lieutenant.

38:59.370 --> 39:01.172
No sign of any Germans...

39:02.707 --> 39:04.655
There's another place
we should check.

39:24.095 --> 39:28.066
Well, they're not leaving
any time soon.

39:30.735 --> 39:32.236
It's a tank.

39:32.237 --> 39:36.185
It's about 30 meters up from a couple
of rocks on the west side of the road.

39:36.540 --> 39:41.978
It's a Panzer, dug in deep,
it's in firing position.

39:41.979 --> 39:44.716
And there is the
commanding officer.

39:46.851 --> 39:50.019
Klaus Shonbeck he is a
retired tank commander.

39:50.020 --> 39:52.155
He teaches at the Tank Corp
Training School.

39:52.156 --> 39:57.762
Well, apparently he's come
out of retirement.

40:09.540 --> 40:11.743
Hey Mitchell is everything okay?

40:13.811 --> 40:16.446
No, she is just leaking
a little.

40:16.447 --> 40:19.482
You know what they say;
Hellcats don't leak oil.

40:19.483 --> 40:21.918
Yeah, they just mark
their territory.

40:21.919 --> 40:25.155
- That's right, you know Hellcats.
- Oh yeah.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.223
Did almost two years of
trainings in maneuvers at Camp

40:27.224 --> 40:31.127
Hood with the 827th and came
here and saw action in November.

40:31.128 --> 40:33.196
827th, really?

40:33.197 --> 40:34.564
That's part of the
12th division.

40:34.565 --> 40:35.800
Yeah, you got it.

40:36.901 --> 40:39.068
So where did you guys get
these Hellcats?

40:39.069 --> 40:41.104
I don't really know, they just
showed up in March.

40:41.105 --> 40:42.305
March?

40:42.306 --> 40:44.240
We were in tow guns
for most of the war,

40:44.241 --> 40:47.043
and then they
switch us over the M18s.

40:47.044 --> 40:50.947
Only two weeks of training
and maneuvers, why?

40:50.948 --> 40:53.183
It's just that they took
our Hellcats in February

40:53.184 --> 40:56.853
and I'm looking at this registration number
and it looks awfully familiar.

40:56.854 --> 40:58.188
Really?

40:58.189 --> 40:59.257
Hey Simms.

40:59.857 --> 41:00.991
What?

41:00.992 --> 41:02.887
Do you think he is
telling the truth?

41:03.093 --> 41:04.494
Which part?

41:04.495 --> 41:08.127
Do you think these Hellcats used to
belong to a bunch of colored boys?

41:08.833 --> 41:10.300
No, he's lying.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.268
No wonder I don't like
riding in them.

41:12.269 --> 41:16.105
Hey, were you the one who
assaulted the officer

41:16.106 --> 41:17.809
with an axe?

41:20.711 --> 41:24.280
You know, I knew a couple of the white
officers assigned to your battalion.

41:24.281 --> 41:26.184
Heard all kinds of
crazy stories.

41:26.849 --> 41:29.586
Said you were always leaving
your Hellcats unguarded,

41:29.587 --> 41:33.124
wandering off, looking for
places to sleep, hide,

41:34.158 --> 41:36.194
disobeying direct orders.

41:37.261 --> 41:38.897
Not in my gun team.

41:41.599 --> 41:45.403
They said you were untrained,
undisciplined and substandard.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.106
But hey,

41:49.307 --> 41:52.465
what do you expect from a bunch
of boys with low AGCT scores?

41:57.181 --> 42:00.016
We've got a panzer dug in,
it's about two kilometers

42:00.017 --> 42:01.351
up this road.

42:01.352 --> 42:05.054
They've got at least a dozen
foot soldiers with them.

42:05.055 --> 42:08.124
Simms, get the CP on the horn.

42:08.125 --> 42:10.126
On it.

42:10.127 --> 42:14.065
Arctic Forward, this is Hellcat
#2, are you there?

42:20.304 --> 42:23.172
Over. Arctic Forward, this is
Hellcat #2, do you copy?

42:23.173 --> 42:24.242
Over.

42:28.646 --> 42:30.213
Hellcat #1, this is

42:30.214 --> 42:33.017
Hellcat #2, do you hear me?

42:36.186 --> 42:37.921
I read you, go ahead.

42:37.922 --> 42:40.133
Ping Pong how does that
signal sound, over.

42:41.202 --> 42:44.360
Like you are talking into a tin
can, is your antenna hang up?

42:44.361 --> 42:45.929
No.

42:45.930 --> 42:47.697
Try channel two.

42:47.698 --> 42:49.133
Roger that.

42:51.635 --> 42:55.338
Arctic Forward, this is
Hellcat #2, do you copy?

42:55.339 --> 42:56.875
Over.

43:01.452 --> 43:02.979
Hey Nelson our radio is crap,

43:02.980 --> 43:06.316
can you call the CP and give him
an update on the situation here?

43:06.317 --> 43:08.086
Roger, will do.

43:09.253 --> 43:11.988
Arctic Forward, this is Hellcat
1, do you read me?

43:11.989 --> 43:13.024
Over.

43:15.125 --> 43:18.328
Arctic Forward, this is
Annie, do you copy?

43:18.329 --> 43:19.898
Over.

43:25.369 --> 43:26.304
Hey Sarge.

43:26.504 --> 43:29.973
We are getting nothing on either radio;
I'm guessing it's the mountains.

43:29.974 --> 43:31.274
Well keep trying.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.310
You got it.

43:33.811 --> 43:38.381
Well the way I figure, we just
knock out this panzer ourselves

43:38.382 --> 43:39.849
and be on our way.

43:39.850 --> 43:42.251
Sure we shouldn't wait for some
support to get in here?

43:42.252 --> 43:43.922
It's one lousy panzer.

43:44.655 --> 43:46.658
We've got two tank destroyers.

43:47.992 --> 43:52.150
Besides, what kind of support do you give
to the guys who do all the supporting?

43:53.163 --> 43:55.431
All right, but you said he
is dug in deep.

43:55.432 --> 43:57.266
There is no way to get around
him for a kill shot.

43:57.267 --> 44:01.337
Yeah, and he is old, slow,
its armor is thin.

44:01.338 --> 44:03.031
A round a 76 millimeters armor piercing;

44:03.032 --> 44:05.274
we'll go straight through
that front glacial plate.

44:05.275 --> 44:08.277
Okay, when we are talking 1500
yards, that's one thing.

44:08.278 --> 44:10.046
But you said this is close,
real close,

44:10.047 --> 44:11.514
he gets off one shot.

44:11.515 --> 44:15.351
One good hit and he cuts us open
like a can of backed beans.

44:15.352 --> 44:16.487
Max.

44:17.603 --> 44:21.025
What happens if somebody comes down
this road from the other side?

44:21.225 --> 44:22.460
They are dead.

44:23.694 --> 44:24.852
But we can prevent it.

44:25.863 --> 44:29.495
The boys at Baker are counting on us;
we've got to move this out, now.

44:30.334 --> 44:33.137
I say we take out the Germans
and be on our way.

44:36.140 --> 44:37.408
Okay John.

44:37.775 --> 44:39.242
I'm game.

44:39.243 --> 44:41.079
But do not get me killed.

44:43.480 --> 44:45.715
All right, what's the plan?

44:45.716 --> 44:48.284
My gun team will move out in
front of the Jimmy's, we'll cut

44:48.285 --> 44:50.319
immediately to the right.

44:50.320 --> 44:54.057
The Germans will track us try
to get a kill shot.

44:54.058 --> 44:57.226
At that point you guys come out
from around the truck and you

44:57.227 --> 44:59.130
fire on the panzer's position.

45:00.097 --> 45:01.798
You are going to play decoy?

45:01.799 --> 45:05.136
Yeah and you are going to
knock them out.

45:07.304 --> 45:08.304
Okay.

45:10.474 --> 45:13.743
Holland, Rodger, let's load up.

45:13.744 --> 45:18.548
I was thinking, Sergeant Owens
should ride with us.

45:18.549 --> 45:20.116
Sarge, I don't think it's
a great idea-

45:20.117 --> 45:21.452
Shut your pie hole.

45:26.457 --> 45:29.392
I think it would be best if he
stays here with the lieutenant.

45:29.393 --> 45:32.430
Owens was a gun commander
with the 827th.

45:33.864 --> 45:37.268
A second pair of eyes up
front would only help.

45:38.302 --> 45:39.370
John,

45:41.572 --> 45:43.107
he knows the drill.

45:48.212 --> 45:52.283
Owens, you can ride upfront.

45:54.351 --> 45:55.486
Let's move them out.

46:04.595 --> 46:07.563
Welcome to the bread box.

46:07.564 --> 46:10.233
Kind of nice being back
in the Hellcat?

46:10.234 --> 46:16.474
Oh yeah, feels like home,
if you live in a box.

46:19.143 --> 46:24.547
Hey, I'm sorry about Simms, you
have just got to ignore him.

46:24.548 --> 46:27.150
I've met plenty of his
kind in my day.

46:27.151 --> 46:28.484
I can handle it.

46:28.485 --> 46:30.419
He is a bit of an odd duck.

46:30.420 --> 46:33.422
He is a real stickler about
following all the rules.

46:33.423 --> 46:35.126
By the book?

46:35.893 --> 46:39.228
Yeah, I think they call
that anal retentive.

46:39.229 --> 46:40.651
You've got half that right.

46:43.834 --> 46:47.472
Atwood, we are all ready up
here, ready to roll.

46:53.510 --> 46:56.646
Danny Boy, what have we
got in the spread?

46:56.647 --> 46:59.448
We've got three rounds of armor
piercing and two rounds of high

46:59.449 --> 47:01.184
explosives in the ready rack.

47:01.185 --> 47:02.952
Go ahead and load us up
with armor piercing.

47:02.953 --> 47:04.522
You've got it Sarge.

47:09.660 --> 47:15.364
Max, load up with AP. Once you
light them up you hit them

47:15.365 --> 47:17.233
again just to be sure.

47:17.234 --> 47:18.402
Roger that.

47:19.436 --> 47:22.371
Any more of your chaps come up
the road; I'll hold them up

47:22.372 --> 47:23.472
till you get back.

47:23.473 --> 47:25.208
Great, see you soon.

47:25.209 --> 47:26.309
God speed.

47:26.310 --> 47:27.416
Mitchell take us out.

47:35.452 --> 47:38.888
Ramrod, keep it steady
at this speed.

47:38.889 --> 47:40.358
Roger that.

47:44.494 --> 47:47.698
Where are you Fritzy,
coming to get you.

48:03.313 --> 48:05.615
Condron, stop here.

48:05.616 --> 48:06.483
Fire when ready.

48:06.484 --> 48:09.187
- Clear.
- On the way.

48:11.555 --> 48:15.326
Another round of AP. One yard to
the left and slightly lower.

48:16.660 --> 48:18.529
- Clear.
- On the way.

48:21.932 --> 48:24.267
Mitchell, stop here.

48:24.268 --> 48:25.668
Fire on my signal.

48:25.669 --> 48:27.371
Two yards to the left.

48:31.375 --> 48:34.212
Two panzers right flank, move,
move, move, move.

48:35.545 --> 48:38.216
Whitaker, get out of there.

49:12.616 --> 49:15.686
Hey we've got Germans
on the west.

49:28.532 --> 49:31.335
Sergeant's been hit.
He's hit.

49:41.645 --> 49:43.579
What now?
Where do we go?

49:43.580 --> 49:46.617
Mitchell don't stop, keep
moving, follow the road.

50:06.603 --> 50:07.805
Over here.

50:19.583 --> 50:20.785
What happened?

50:21.852 --> 50:23.786
They're all dead.

50:23.787 --> 50:25.088
Oh my eyes are burning

50:25.089 --> 50:27.656
I'm going ahead to find the
rest of the chaps.

50:27.657 --> 50:29.392
You going to be okay?

50:29.393 --> 50:30.527
Yeah I'm fine.

50:30.528 --> 50:32.461
I'm not going anywhere
with this leg

50:32.462 --> 50:34.163
Take my rifle.

50:34.164 --> 50:35.566
It's got a full clip.

50:37.534 --> 50:38.836
I'll guard the road...

50:40.570 --> 50:42.405
let them know I'm here.

50:42.406 --> 50:43.674
God speed.

50:50.614 --> 50:52.148
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:52.149 --> 50:54.917
Hey Mitchell, this bridge is
never going to hold our weight.

50:54.918 --> 50:56.620
Back it up.
Back it up.

51:10.434 --> 51:12.435
Whitaker, this is Simms.
Do you copy?

51:12.436 --> 51:13.702
Over.

51:13.703 --> 51:14.972
Sarge is dead.

51:16.106 --> 51:17.907
Mitchell, did any of
them make it out?

51:17.908 --> 51:19.910
I couldn't see anything.

51:21.511 --> 51:23.212
I saw three German tanks.

51:23.213 --> 51:25.483
Whitaker got one of
them for sure.

51:26.917 --> 51:28.484
We're trapped.

51:28.485 --> 51:30.719
Since we can't go across this
bridge the only way out of here

51:30.720 --> 51:33.456
is to go back up that road
where those krauts are.

51:33.457 --> 51:35.891
It won't be long before they
come looking for us.

51:35.892 --> 51:37.728
We got to get out of here.

51:39.229 --> 51:41.964
This is Hellcat #2.
Does anyone read me?

51:41.965 --> 51:43.467
Copy.

51:48.238 --> 51:50.741
Do you read me?
Is there anyone out there?

51:51.875 --> 51:55.513
This is Avenging Angel if anyone
can read me, copy.

52:24.775 --> 52:27.543
Looks like we're stuck here 'til
someone comes looking for us.

52:27.544 --> 52:29.512
There's higher ground, next
to that building.

52:29.513 --> 52:32.181
Maybe we can get a stronger
signal from there.

52:32.182 --> 52:35.586
Danny, leave him, mount up.

52:57.251 --> 52:59.041
Arctic Forward, this is
Hellcat #2.

52:59.042 --> 53:00.544
Do you copy?

53:04.781 --> 53:07.017
Does anybody read me?
Over.

53:12.956 --> 53:15.558
Arctic Forward, this
is Avenging Angel.

53:15.559 --> 53:16.727
Do you copy?

53:20.564 --> 53:21.599
Do you hear that.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.870
It's still not good enough.

53:37.847 --> 53:38.949
Lieutenant.

53:41.218 --> 53:43.052
Whitaker is wounded but
he'll be okay.

53:43.053 --> 53:44.264
He's guarding the road.

53:45.855 --> 53:47.791
Everybody else was killed.

53:53.330 --> 53:55.297
Atwood is dead.

53:55.298 --> 53:57.067
So what do you suggest we do?

53:58.301 --> 54:00.538
Well, you should ask him not me.

54:03.707 --> 54:05.774
Why would I do that?

54:05.775 --> 54:06.597
He's a sergeant.

54:06.797 --> 54:07.978
He outranks all of you.

54:09.012 --> 54:10.846
This is not my army
you remember.

54:10.847 --> 54:12.982
This is a segregated army.

54:12.983 --> 54:14.917
I'm not going to take
orders from him.

54:14.918 --> 54:17.620
Corporal, I suggest you put your
differences aside and let-

54:17.621 --> 54:18.887
I'll take the
commander's position.

54:18.888 --> 54:20.723
Barlow you're the gunner now.

54:20.724 --> 54:22.225
What?
Hold on, are you nuts?

54:22.226 --> 54:23.626
- I haven't been trained for that.
- What are you talking about?

54:23.627 --> 54:26.496
You have plenty of time in the
gunner's seat when we did maneuvers.

54:26.497 --> 54:27.630
Yeah that was like three hours.
That's it.

54:27.631 --> 54:29.064
Barlow, shut up.

54:29.065 --> 54:30.799
You're the gunner now.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.002
Owens was a gun commander
for two years.

54:33.003 --> 54:35.070
He knows Hellcats better
than any of us.

54:35.071 --> 54:36.972
Mitchell, you heard what I said.

54:36.973 --> 54:39.041
I'm not going to take
orders from a nigger.

54:39.042 --> 54:40.876
Corporal, you figure it out.

54:40.877 --> 54:42.244
Shonbeck is sure to be coming

54:42.245 --> 54:44.013
down that road and
when he does...

54:44.014 --> 54:46.415
- I'm going to kill him.
- Lieutenant, wait.

54:46.416 --> 54:47.718
Take this.

55:03.867 --> 55:06.802
Have you ever taken out
an enemy tank?

55:06.803 --> 55:08.937
Nine tanks in Hauton.

55:08.938 --> 55:10.305
Another four in...

55:10.306 --> 55:11.506
Let's just ditch the Hellcats
and get out of here.

55:11.507 --> 55:14.810
Barlow, pull apart the firing
mechanisms

55:14.811 --> 55:15.969
and spread the pieces.

55:16.547 --> 55:18.947
I'll break apart the
gun sight myself. Mitchell...

55:18.948 --> 55:20.282
smash the battery.

55:20.283 --> 55:21.984
I'm not leaving the Hellcat
here for the Nazis.

55:21.985 --> 55:23.019
I'm staying right here.

55:23.020 --> 55:25.087
You crazy, they've
got three tanks.

55:25.088 --> 55:26.288
So the minute you're
outnumbered,

55:26.289 --> 55:29.126
you want to run?
Ain't that a hoot.

55:33.997 --> 55:35.733
I don't want to die today.

55:36.833 --> 55:38.360
Mitchell and I can handle it.

55:39.769 --> 55:42.033
If you and Barlow want to
run then go ahead.

55:43.707 --> 55:45.776
But I wasn't raised to
run from a fight.

55:47.977 --> 55:49.845
Why would we risk our lives?

55:49.846 --> 55:50.846
For what?

55:52.015 --> 55:55.484
American vehicles are going to
be coming down that road.

55:55.485 --> 55:58.055
It's the main route until
they fix the bridge.

55:59.889 --> 56:04.728
Everyone, including the General
will be using that road.

56:06.062 --> 56:07.297
Be a hero Simms.

56:08.364 --> 56:10.417
They might just give you
a medal for it.

56:11.868 --> 56:12.868
Me? No.

56:13.948 --> 56:17.106
It's you that's driven by some
kind of a heroic destiny okay?

56:17.107 --> 56:19.408
This is your proving ground.

56:19.409 --> 56:20.543
What are you trying to say?

56:20.544 --> 56:23.011
You know exactly what I'm
trying to say.

56:23.012 --> 56:26.215
This is your last chance to make
something of yourself, right?

56:26.216 --> 56:29.752
The war is over but you want to
go to back to the cotton fields

56:29.753 --> 56:30.920
to tell your papa how you-

56:30.921 --> 56:33.190
led a group of
white boys into battle.

56:36.025 --> 56:39.461
My father is dead,
and he was not a cotton picker,

56:39.462 --> 56:40.964
he was a soldier.

56:42.432 --> 56:45.969
He fought in France in 1917,

56:46.903 --> 56:50.205
in one of the most
decorated battalions.

56:50.206 --> 56:53.175
He was awarded the
Legion of Honor by the French

56:53.176 --> 56:57.114
but the Americans wouldn't
award medals to Negros.

56:58.982 --> 57:02.953
When he came back home and asked
for equal treatment,

57:05.789 --> 57:07.758
he was lynched...

57:09.793 --> 57:13.061
and that's the
last time I saw him,

57:13.062 --> 57:15.464
hanging there from that tree.

57:15.465 --> 57:18.934
If it's God's Will that
I go home alive,

57:18.935 --> 57:22.805
I will not brag
about days like this...

57:22.806 --> 57:25.342
when I had to fight to
beside someone like you.

57:30.547 --> 57:34.116
It's always the same
story for the Negro.

57:34.117 --> 57:37.020
First your country,
then your rights.

57:38.254 --> 57:40.958
So we fight our
country's battles,

57:43.893 --> 57:46.528
but we never seem to
get the rights

57:46.529 --> 57:47.596
or the simple respect

57:47.597 --> 57:50.334
of human dignity
for what we've done.

57:52.168 --> 57:53.771
Guys there is a tank coming.

57:56.539 --> 57:57.906
I got it. I got it.

57:57.907 --> 57:59.309
Move, move, move.

58:25.635 --> 58:27.536
That panzers just went
behind the building.

58:27.537 --> 58:29.972
Look I can't hit him
if I can't see him.

58:29.973 --> 58:32.341
If that tank comes around that
corner you take him out.

58:32.342 --> 58:33.943
It's that simple.

58:33.944 --> 58:36.645
I'm going up in that tower so I
can see exactly where they are.

58:36.646 --> 58:38.949
Okay? Got it?

58:40.183 --> 58:41.550
Simms, you got it?

58:41.551 --> 58:43.353
Shut up. I got it.

59:30.333 --> 59:33.303
Owens is saying that the
tank is stopped.

59:34.938 --> 59:37.339
I heard tank fire.
Is everything okay?

59:37.340 --> 59:41.109
There is an enemy tank on the
other side of this building.

59:41.110 --> 59:43.013
Hey come get this.

59:51.354 --> 59:54.391
That gentlemen, is radio wire.

59:55.224 --> 59:57.294
Owens just built you an antenna.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.968
Okay, try it now.

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:09.973
Arctic Forward this is Hellcat
#2, do you copy? Over.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.209
This is Hellcat #2 to
Arctic Forward, do you copy?

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.477
Over.

01:00:15.478 --> 01:00:19.314
This is Arctic Forward go
ahead Hellcat 2, over.

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:22.217
We've been ambushed by
three German tanks,

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:24.419
they are old panzers,
Atwood is dead,

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:28.090
Whitaker's gun team's been
taken out, Annie is destroyed.

01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:32.060
Please repeat, how many
enemy tanks? Over.

01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:34.029
One is immobilized,
there are still two more

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.346
trying to maneuver on us.

01:00:36.014 --> 01:00:39.067
Sir, we are getting a radio
message from Atwood's gun team.

01:00:39.068 --> 01:00:41.737
- Where are they?
- It's hard to hear them sir.

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:44.006
What is your current location?
Over.

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:47.075
We are located four kilometers
south of Sankt Andreasberg,

01:00:47.076 --> 01:00:50.278
behind an abandoned
mill off the 520.

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:52.983
We are trapped in a box canyon.

01:00:57.287 --> 01:01:00.155
They've been ambushed here right
off the 520, the bridge is

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:02.257
under repair, the MP is
re-directed among the

01:01:02.258 --> 01:01:03.592
alternative road.

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:05.761
Okay, radio HQ quickly, tell
them not to let the

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:06.996
General leave, it's not safe.

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:09.164
- Roger that.
- And get somebody there now.

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:10.267
Yes sir.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.334
Did it work?

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:13.661
We were able to radio company command

01:01:13.662 --> 01:01:15.704
and they're scrambling to
get us some help, but for now

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:17.272
they are saying
we're on our own.

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:20.175
Now that tank is not going to
move, he's fixed on waiting for

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:23.045
us to come out first, if they
Germans get their third tank up

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:26.048
and running they are going to come
here and find a way to force us out.

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:28.517
What about that PAK-40 we found?

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.185
Yeah that's a good idea.

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:32.755
- You guys started on towed guns right?
- Yeah, what's it to you?

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:35.835
Well if we want a fighting chance it's
going to have to be you and I up there,

01:01:36.035 --> 01:01:37.594
Simms are you going to do this or not?

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:43.732
Sir, the General left 20 minutes
ago; they are sending the

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:45.067
MPs to catch him.

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:47.069
This is not good, who do we have
on this side that we can

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.471
send out there?
Do we have any armor?

01:01:48.472 --> 01:01:50.405
I can get a half-track and put
together a security team.

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:52.075
Do it and do it quickly.

01:01:53.583 --> 01:01:56.478
So they surrounded us, began to
bombard the village with

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:59.483
artillery fire every 45 minutes,

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:04.086
we held them off for 22
hours straight.

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:05.756
That's 22 hours gentlemen.

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:09.933
We weren't going to give them
one inch of that village.

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:21.571
What is it?

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:24.041
Thought I heard something.

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.279
You think you brought
enough gear?

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:34.317
This is not a camping trip.

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:46.161
How the hell are we supposed
to move this thing?

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:48.689
I don't know, we are just
going to do it somehow.

01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:50.260
Come on; come on keep going,

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:53.296
a little more.

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:55.230
Alright to the left.

01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:57.400
Right there, right there.

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:01.203
I think this is as close as we
are going to get it.

01:04:01.204 --> 01:04:02.571
Hey get some ammo.

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:04.374
Let's hope this works.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.533
Hey why is he moving,
give me some ammo.

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:16.653
Alright get back, get back.

01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:23.591
Hurry he's moving.

01:04:23.592 --> 01:04:25.329
We've got to move it
to the right.

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:29.764
They missed.

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:31.633
The Germans are backing up
this might be your

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:33.203
chance to knock them out.

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:43.180
Right there.

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:53.290
Simms, get down.

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:00.564
Germans.

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:10.972
We can't stay here; we've got to
get back to the mill.

01:05:10.973 --> 01:05:12.374
Let's fall back, ready?

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:13.476
Go! Go! Go!

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:43.240
On the way.

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:49.512
Direct hit, hit him again.

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:53.250
- Hurry!
- I'm trying.

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:56.720
On the way.

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:42.424
Arctic Forward to Hellcat 2,
I repeat, Arctic Forward to

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:44.459
Hellcat 2, do you read me?
Over.

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:45.861
Wolsey what's happening?

01:07:45.862 --> 01:07:48.730
They are not responding anymore
sir, they are just gone.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.132
Okay, keep trying to get them.

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:52.434
I need to know where they are
and where the General is.

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:53.736
Yes sir.

01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:55.237
Arctic Forward to Avenging
Angel are you there?

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:58.807
I repeat Arctic Forward to
Avenging Angel, do you read me?

01:07:58.808 --> 01:07:59.876
Over.

01:08:06.482 --> 01:08:09.886
Tank, there's a tank on our
right, back up, back up.

01:08:14.123 --> 01:08:17.692
I can't see, I'm driving blind,
how far back can I go?

01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:20.796
Go 40 feet straight back and
then swing to the left.

01:08:39.274 --> 01:08:41.749
The transverse isn't working,
electrical is out.

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.952
Use the hand crank...

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.787
It's jammed, something's wrong.

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:47.457
Alright, hold on.

01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:15.076
It's clear.

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:16.811
Check that, look are
they all dead?

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:18.047
Yeah, they're dead.

01:10:25.321 --> 01:10:27.288
See any more Germans?

01:10:27.289 --> 01:10:32.695
No, sure hope Danny and Mitchell
took out that last German tank.

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:38.535
Thirsty?

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:42.872
I'm fine.

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:54.283
It was me.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.770
What are you talking
about Owens?

01:10:58.554 --> 01:11:01.089
I'm the one who assaulted that
white officer that you

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:02.959
asked about earlier.

01:11:05.039 --> 01:11:06.461
His name was Captain Davis.

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:08.029
Listen I don't want to hear any
more about it Owens.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:09.599
I think you do.

01:11:10.628 --> 01:11:14.102
Back in early February we'd just
come up fighting in Colmar Pocket.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:18.339
We just lost four Hellcats and
morale was really low.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.183
We were ill prepared
for the winter.

01:11:24.475 --> 01:11:27.949
Harris and Cooper put this fire
out, you all know better than that.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:29.484
Come on give us a break Sarge.

01:11:29.485 --> 01:11:32.086
We're just trying to survive
here; I'd rather take a licking

01:11:32.087 --> 01:11:34.824
for having a fire,
than freezing to death.

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:42.430
Is it too much to ask for
some extra socks?

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:45.667
Uncle Sam just wants you to kill
some Nazis, he don't care about

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:48.002
your little old ugly black feet.

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:50.171
Sarge, when are we going to get
the proper gear,

01:11:50.172 --> 01:11:51.975
gloves, something?

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:57.011
Look I'll ask just like
I've been doing.

01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:59.914
You need to put this fire out
get back to the Hellcat you

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:01.683
boys need to sober up.

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:04.786
Five more minutes,
just five more minutes.

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:06.788
I can almost feel my feet.

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:08.356
Come on Owens.

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:11.125
What would your mama say if she
saw you carrying on like this?

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:13.062
I don't have a family Sarge,

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:16.588
you are the closest thing
to a mama I got.

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:20.970
Got nobody to go home to?

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:27.375
Go home; you think we
are going home?

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:29.911
He thinks we are going to
survive this war.

01:12:29.912 --> 01:12:32.847
We aren't going to make it
out of here Sarge.

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:34.982
You aren't going to make it and
we certainly aren't

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:36.052
going to make it.

01:12:38.053 --> 01:12:39.789
It will keep you warm.

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:48.731
Five more minutes.

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:51.966
To the 827th.

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:54.003
827th.

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:58.906
Lord!
Finally he drinks with his crew,

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:00.842
I never thought I'd see the day.

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:02.278
You are right about that.

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:06.247
You paint this?

01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:08.816
Yeah, it's good right?

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:09.984
Oh yeah, it's good, it's good.

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:11.919
You know my nephew is a painter,

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.868
yeah looks like
something he would do.

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:16.458
He is 5 years old.

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:22.764
You've got jokes

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:24.233
That ain't funny.

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.936
What in the hell is
going on over here.

01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:32.075
You want to invite the Germans
over here to kill us.

01:13:37.179 --> 01:13:38.981
Well, well, well,

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:42.118
you are all drunk.

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:47.223
Owens over here.

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:53.194
This is how you run
your gun team?

01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:56.197
They know better than to start a
fire, they're just freezing sir.

01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:58.933
We need socks, gloves and
warm coats sir.

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:01.003
And you'll get it,

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:04.006
as it's available.

01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:07.008
- Hey you driver.
- Corporal Harrison sir.

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:09.944
Well Harrison you go get that
Hellcat right now, I don't want

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:12.246
to see you out of that driver
seat 'til daybreak.

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:13.983
- Yes sir.
- Let's go.

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.056
The rest of you are
going on patrol.

01:14:22.115 --> 01:14:25.326
Owens, I want you to take them
up to that trail up there and I

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:29.031
want to know if there are any Krauts
on the other side of that river bank.

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:30.765
I don't know if it's a good idea
sir, they are drunk.

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:36.237
It's a great idea and you can
walk off that drunken stupor.

01:14:36.238 --> 01:14:38.374
Get going before I write you up

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:42.143
and I want you to
report back to me,

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.212
personally,

01:14:44.179 --> 01:14:45.314
in one hour.

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:51.287
Yes sir.

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:05.633
Here we are fighting in the US
army against an enemy that

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:08.569
thinks they are better than
everybody else but everybody in

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:11.072
this army think they are
better than us.

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:14.175
How come we ain't got nobody
fighting for us?

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:17.178
It's like a dog chasing its own
tail you get that?

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:18.913
Yeah, we got it
Smitty now shut up.

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:20.014
You shut up Gaines.

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:22.216
Both of you shut up,
you are too loud.

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:24.285
Now we wouldn't be out here if
you weren't drunk.

01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:26.154
I ain't drunk.

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:28.656
Get down, get down.

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:30.026
maybe a little drunk.

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:33.895
Smitty no more talking.

01:15:33.896 --> 01:15:36.898
Just give me my flask I'll
be quite as a wisp.

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:39.901
You'll get your flask when we
are done with this patrol.

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:44.171
Well will you hurry it up,
it's taking forever.

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:46.073
You don't know where we are,
do you?

01:15:46.074 --> 01:15:47.076
And you do?

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:51.989
I can lead us up to that river bank
and back to camp in five minutes.

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:57.018
I'd love to see that,
you take point.

01:15:57.019 --> 01:15:59.253
You want him on point Sarge
as drunk as he is?

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:01.188
Maybe it will sober him up.

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:03.190
Just don't be drinking out
of my flask now.

01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:06.996
I won't, now you promise
no more talking.

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:09.365
Go on.

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:13.615
Now I mean it Sarge
don't be drinking-

01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:17.273
Down get down, take cover.

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:22.209
Cooper get behind the tree,

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:24.881
get down, put your
head down Cooper.

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:37.224
Gaines put your head down.

01:16:37.225 --> 01:16:39.260
You are going to run and I'm
going to cover you, you got it?

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:40.394
Okay.

01:16:40.395 --> 01:16:46.168
On three, one, two, three.

01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:52.108
Gaines!

01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:06.022
Davis knew he was sending us on
a suicide mission.

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:11.993
When I got back to camp I got
real drunk when I went in to

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:14.063
report that's when I attacked.

01:17:14.988 --> 01:17:18.199
A week later they busted us down
to truck detail and every day

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.201
since then I've wondered if
I hadn't done that,

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:22.271
there might still be an 827.

01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:31.013
Would you look at that,

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:35.016
Hellcats coming back.

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:36.317
It's been hit.

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:38.185
Which means if they
are coming back,

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:40.713
there's probably a German
tank right behind them.

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:53.701
We can use this.

01:17:53.702 --> 01:17:56.303
You want to shoot an enemy tank
with a Panzerfaust?

01:17:56.304 --> 01:17:58.240
How are you going to
get that close?

01:17:59.148 --> 01:18:02.043
Well the weakest spot on a tank
is the underbelly right?

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:03.310
Right.

01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:05.179
If we can convince the Germans

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.148
that out Hellcat's on
its last leg,

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:09.450
then we might be able to
move them into a position where

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:10.852
we can knock them out.

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:13.538
How are you going to get a shot
underneath the tank?

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:18.260
I'll show you.

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:29.438
We've got Germans on the wall.

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:54.363
Okay I think I got them all.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.066
You doing okay?

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:01.268
- Danny Boy?
- I'm fine.

01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:04.205
Danny, Simms, I'm under the
Hellcat, open up.

01:19:04.206 --> 01:19:05.439
Mitchell are you hearing that?

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.208
Shut up it's me Simms.

01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:09.145
Danny, open the escape hatch.

01:19:11.302 --> 01:19:12.513
Why are you down there?

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:13.848
What happened to the Hellcat?

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:16.183
They got a shot off so now the
turret won't work.

01:19:16.184 --> 01:19:17.585
Are they following you?

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.153
Yeah, I'm pretty sure there's
one heading this way.

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:20.388
Look we have an idea.

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:23.124
I need rags, anything we can
set on fire okay?

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:24.494
Where's that metal bucket.

01:19:45.914 --> 01:19:47.416
Put the gun down Shonbeck.

01:20:07.369 --> 01:20:13.509
Lieutenant, do you know what we
do to prisoners that escape?

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:21.484
We kill them.

01:20:23.852 --> 01:20:25.387
We kill them.

01:20:43.939 --> 01:20:45.708
Hans, come here.

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:16.498
Danny!
Danny!

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:18.715
Hey give me your lighter.

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:25.506
Okay I'm going to light this on fire
and it's going to start to smoke.

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:26.908
That should make the Hellcat
look like it's in bad shape.

01:22:26.909 --> 01:22:30.346
Hopefully he'll follow you right
down over this opening.

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:36.684
Let's hope Owens' plan works,
you got it?

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:37.853
I got it.

01:22:40.422 --> 01:22:42.723
Okay, crew's ready to go?

01:22:42.724 --> 01:22:46.567
I don't recommend standing there, guard
the hall and keep the Germans out.

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:52.648
You know you're going to get
yourself killed.

01:22:53.023 --> 01:22:55.602
It's the only way we are going
to get a kill shot.

01:22:55.603 --> 01:22:59.441
If that tank comes over this
opening then we've got a shot.

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:02.845
Good luck.

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:17.593
Okay it's smoking.

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:21.363
I hope those Germans follow us.

01:25:36.764 --> 01:25:38.434
Come on.

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:45.999
What happened to here?

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.503
We were ambushed.

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:50.304
Three panzers hiding.

01:26:50.305 --> 01:26:52.463
They are waiting for
Americans to pass by.

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:16.532
Hell of a mess wouldn't you say?

01:27:18.666 --> 01:27:20.636
A lot of people died today sir.

01:27:21.836 --> 01:27:23.679
Corporal Simms told me
what you did.

01:27:24.173 --> 01:27:26.306
He said if you hadn't been here
to take charge those Germans

01:27:26.307 --> 01:27:28.742
would still be
holding this road.

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:31.112
Thanks to you a lot of lives
were saved today.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.014
Just doing my duty sir.

01:27:34.015 --> 01:27:37.884
The Corporal also said you
set a good example.

01:27:37.885 --> 01:27:40.822
Made good decisions, assertive.

01:27:44.025 --> 01:27:46.815
I'm going to recommend you for
a Silver Star Sergeant.

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:50.364
It's really not necessary sir.

01:27:50.365 --> 01:27:52.933
You are going to tell me how to
run my division Sergeant?

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:54.970
- No sir.
- I didn't think so.

01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:01.810
Let me take a look
at your leg Sarge.

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:06.915
Looks like you made it.

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:09.818
Yes.

01:28:13.721 --> 01:28:15.090
Do you have my pistol?

01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:50.225
How you doing?

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:53.829
I'm not really sure.

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:01.803
You did good Danny,

01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:06.174
really good.

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:08.944
Thanks.

01:29:22.824 --> 01:29:25.192
You know I'm surprised
you're still alive.

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.293
The back blast from that

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:27.979
Panzerfaust
should've killed you.

01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:31.867
Maybe I've got an angel
watching over me.

01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:35.203
Yeah maybe you do.

01:29:45.747 --> 01:29:47.149
Thanks.

01:30:06.868 --> 01:30:07.969
So sergeant,

01:30:09.804 --> 01:30:12.752
what was the name of that
Hellcat you were talking about?

01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:18.913
When I look at the name of this
thing and I ask the private...
