00:17.164 --> 00:19.694
I'd like to place
an order for delivery.

00:19.742 --> 00:24.882
Can I get the crispy noodles with
shrimp, and the calamari salad?

00:24.943 --> 00:28.903
Get the Vietnamese rolls and
the chicken with the spicy curry.

00:28.911 --> 00:32.418
And Vietnamese rolls and
the chicken with spicy curry

00:32.595 --> 00:36.981
- You guys want something from Thai-Phoon?
- Yeah, some Pad Thai, please?

00:36.985 --> 00:42.480
Yeah, Mom, Mom, will you order a couple gallons of that Tom Yun soup
and then the salmon with the chili lime sauce?

00:42.493 --> 00:43.544
And dumplings, please.

00:43.550 --> 00:48.853
Okay, can we get some pad Thai, some Tom Yun soup,
Salmon with the chili lime sauce...

00:48.856 --> 00:52.892
- Dumplings...!
- .. oh, and the steamed dumplings. Yeah, great.

00:52.914 --> 00:54.805
We have ordered enough for a small army..

00:54.840 --> 00:57.840
I got an idea. Why don't you two invite
your female cohorts over?

00:57.860 --> 01:01.620
Lindsay's with her mom.
Family therapy, and to a Truffaut retrospective.

01:01.655 --> 01:04.989
That's a hell of a double header
What about Alex?

01:08.998 --> 01:11.959
- Howdy.?
- Uh... what are you doing here?

01:12.107 --> 01:16.505
Okay, that's not the warmest
greeting I've ever received, but I will take it.

01:16.527 --> 01:20.209
Uh, I didn't expect to see you here, right now.
I'm kind of busy.

01:20.212 --> 01:23.046
Listen, I wanted to invite you
to have dinner with the family.

01:23.057 --> 01:25.249
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:26.164 --> 01:27.619
My ex is in town.

01:29.243 --> 01:31.640
Actually, in my office,

01:32.032 --> 01:33.780
waiting for me.

01:35.667 --> 01:36.556
Oh, your ex.

01:38.022 --> 01:43.182
Well, part of the ABC's of the ex,
is to step aside for the I and the U.

01:43.934 --> 01:47.639
But the ex isn't technically an ex.

01:47.664 --> 01:52.500
We never really broke up, officially.
It's part of what we need to figure out, but, um...

01:52.539 --> 01:56.061
I really do want to come have
dinner with your family,

01:56.062 --> 01:58.667
so maybe we can do it
after the ex leaves?

01:58.668 --> 02:01.618
Okay, so the ex is leaving?
When, later tonight?

02:02.193 --> 02:04.775
Staying the night... that's cool.
Staying the week?

02:04.776 --> 02:09.598
Um... I didn't know this was going to happen,
and now it has, and I have to deal with it,

02:09.600 --> 02:13.367
so it would be great, if you could just...
.. let me figure it out.

02:13.368 --> 02:16.530
Just in other words, stay away
while the ex is in town.

02:16.534 --> 02:19.170
Unless you're cool with the
three of us hanging out.

02:19.185 --> 02:21.773
Okay, well, I'll have
to get back to you on that.

02:40.580 --> 02:42.559
I like the new club.

02:45.292 --> 02:49.088
- You ready to get out of here?
- Mm-hmm. In a minute.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.966
- So what if Alex has an ex?
- Most people do.

03:29.973 --> 03:35.924
That's right. He's probably just some meat head thug
with her name tattooed on his bicep.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.416
Well, no threat to you.

03:38.447 --> 03:41.898
Unless, he's a thug with a heart.

03:42.523 --> 03:45.058
He's done his time.
18 months for robbery.

03:45.084 --> 03:50.892
He was wrong, he understands that.
He's mature, he's sensitive, seasoned..

03:51.094 --> 03:55.429
- So you're not okay.
- Not at all, Ryan. Not at all.

03:56.770 --> 04:00.238
- He's spiraling, huh?
- Seth? He hasn't even begun.

04:03.118 --> 04:07.562
Wow, Marissa, that's an amazing skirt
and I love your shoes.

04:07.582 --> 04:10.032
Thanks. I really like your...

04:11.266 --> 04:12.727
.. your backpack.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.637
Where is it from?

04:18.791 --> 04:20.120
LL Bean.

04:21.423 --> 04:25.541
Oh, well... I'm late for class. But, maybe this weekend
we can all hang,

04:25.544 --> 04:27.856
see a movie or go to Balboa Island?

04:27.860 --> 04:29.405
Yeah, sounds good.

04:30.945 --> 04:35.247
Wow, every day she looks like
she could be on the cover of a fashion magazine.

04:35.252 --> 04:36.812
Yeah? Well, I guess.

04:37.675 --> 04:40.191
Good thing I'm not competitive.

04:40.195 --> 04:42.670
- What are you talking about??
- Nothing. It's just,

04:42.672 --> 04:48.427
you know, you said it. Everyone has an ex, and
you seem to hang out with yours a lot.

04:48.428 --> 04:51.622
- We do?
- Mm-hmm, you do, like constantly.

04:52.115 --> 04:54.016
Well, maybe you two
should become friends.

04:54.017 --> 04:56.765
We can all hang out
and it wouldn't be weird.

04:56.777 --> 05:00.649
Yeah, me and the Cosmo girl,
yeah, that wouldn't be weird at all.

05:07.739 --> 05:12.388
Ah, a massage. Wow, you must really
need something.

05:12.711 --> 05:14.842
Favor. Tiny.

05:16.446 --> 05:21.083
Well, ask me while you're giving me the massage.
I'm much more inclined to say yes.

05:21.820 --> 05:23.294
It's about work.

05:24.456 --> 05:28.459
As you know, the Newport Group's reputation
is pretty much in the toilet.

05:28.489 --> 05:29.624
It's well deserved.

05:30.023 --> 05:33.573
The board wants us to come up with a plan
to improve the company's image.

05:33.576 --> 05:36.704
And I figured, who better to ask, than you.

05:36.705 --> 05:39.989
The man who practically invented
hating the Newport Group.

05:39.990 --> 05:43.141
Yeah, well, you know, I was doing it
long before it was trendy.

05:43.186 --> 05:44.953
Yeah, so, any ideas?

05:45.004 --> 05:48.142
Yes, as a matter of fact.
This is perfect.

05:48.231 --> 05:49.240
Perfect's good.

05:49.253 --> 05:52.143
I just got a call to start working
with the Newport Housing Initiative.

05:52.144 --> 05:56.185
They want to put up low-income housing downtown,
and I was going to petition the City Council.

05:56.193 --> 05:58.903
- But the Newport Group could come up with the money.
- Exactly.

05:58.909 --> 06:01.833
- The housing board gets a development...

06:01.852 --> 06:04.780
.. and the company could do something good for a change.
Honey, that's perfect.

06:04.805 --> 06:07.162
You've earned more than a massage.

06:07.313 --> 06:10.570
Where I come from, that only means one thing.

06:19.893 --> 06:21.685
Hey, I have a surprise for you..

06:21.710 --> 06:25.507
I love surprises.
Especially when they're named Jimmy Chew.

06:25.678 --> 06:27.290
Am I about to get whacked?
Here.

06:30.546 --> 06:31.945
Hey, a cupcake.

06:32.572 --> 06:35.460
It doesn't have stiletto heals,
but I'll eat it anyway.

06:35.489 --> 06:37.706
You know it's not my birthday.

06:37.710 --> 06:41.473
Yes, and I also know it's our six-month
anniversary.

06:42.523 --> 06:46.789
Oh, my God, it is. God, it's been six months?
Holy mack.

06:46.820 --> 06:50.675
I know, it's amazing.
I've never been in a relationship this long.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.134
Neither have I.

06:52.174 --> 06:55.665
Well, I think we should celebrate.
I would like to

06:55.666 --> 06:58.905
take you to a romantic anniversary
dinner at the Arches.

06:59.187 --> 07:00.891
What do you say?

07:02.945 --> 07:04.110
So what did you say?

07:04.148 --> 07:07.505
Oh, you know, that I'm fasting
for an upcoming colonoscopy.

07:07.818 --> 07:10.805
I'm sure that was just the
answer he was looking for.

07:10.850 --> 07:15.817
Look, Zach is so unbelievably great, but six months?
I did not even date Cohen that long.

07:15.821 --> 07:20.077
When did we get so old?
When did life get so complicated?

07:20.120 --> 07:24.062
I know. Remember when we were little
and it was just you and me, and all the boys had cooties?

07:24.063 --> 07:27.653
Yeah, we'd have sleepovers and watch Full House
and Step by Step.

07:27.657 --> 07:29.766
Oh, my God.
I loved Full House.

07:29.767 --> 07:33.137
But then, my favorite character was named DJ,
so I guess that's ruined.

07:33.144 --> 07:39.376
No, look, forget DJ. Forget Cohen, and Zach and
Ryan. You know what? we need a break from the boys.

07:39.541 --> 07:41.305
What, you mean
like a girl's night out?

07:41.315 --> 07:44.379
I do indeed. Are you telling me you couldn't
use a night without boys?

07:44.388 --> 07:46.610
Well, Full House is on Nick at Nite.

07:46.619 --> 07:47.809
Really.

07:48.691 --> 07:49.501
Thanks.

07:52.351 --> 07:57.461
So, great news. Sandy has an amazing idea to
kick start an image makeover for the company.

07:57.464 --> 08:00.108
I have better news.
I have a better idea than him.

08:00.110 --> 08:00.874
You haven't heard his yet.

08:00.875 --> 08:04.597
It would be hard for Sandy's
idea to top the best idea ever.

08:04.607 --> 08:07.053
- You ready?
- Probably not, no.

08:12.431 --> 08:14.236
Oh, my...
There's so much you here.

08:14.296 --> 08:18.430
A magazine, Kirsten, about Newport life,
restaurants, events, gossip...

08:18.431 --> 08:21.398
selling Newport Beach
as an aspirational brand.

08:22.151 --> 08:25.245
Well...
Sandy's idea, which is in a different direction,

08:25.246 --> 08:29.491
involves funding a low-income
housing development.

08:29.535 --> 08:32.080
Huh, that's kind of cute.
I guess.

08:32.130 --> 08:35.386
But Kiki, we're trying to appeal
to the Newport elite.

08:35.437 --> 08:37.424
We need to think
about who these people are.

08:37.437 --> 08:40.537
Bored, rich gossip mongers,
who like to shop.

08:40.539 --> 08:44.142
They're me. And I don't care about
low-income housing.

08:44.794 --> 08:46.036
You have a point.

08:48.101 --> 08:49.859
All right.
This is as far as I go.

08:49.870 --> 08:53.752
Thanks for walking me. Have fun at your emergency
comic book meeting.

08:53.753 --> 08:57.174
Why do I get the feeling Seth
won't be talking about comics?

08:57.475 --> 09:00.454
- You okay?
- Yeah, sure, I like eating alone.

09:01.457 --> 09:04.759
- You know, you know who you could sit with?
- Uh, no, that's okay, really.

09:04.764 --> 09:07.946
Come on, the sooner you get to know her,
the sooner she'll stop being my ex and become your friend.

09:07.949 --> 09:11.042
Ryan, don't, okay?
Please? I'm sure they don't even eat.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.854
You guys mind if Lindsay joins you?
I've got to meet Seth.

09:15.868 --> 09:19.003
Oh, no, the emergency comic book meeting
Zach was summoned to?

09:19.013 --> 09:20.399
So you heard.

09:20.412 --> 09:21.990
Have a seat, Lindsay.

09:22.010 --> 09:23.915
Great, thanks you guys.
See ya.

09:26.832 --> 09:30.211
This is so good. Great idea hitting
the drive-thru for lunch.

09:30.228 --> 09:34.613
It'll probably be hours on the elliptical trainer
working those off, huh?

09:35.346 --> 09:38.043
Coop, exercising? Now that's funny.

09:38.049 --> 09:42.714
So you guys can just eat cheeseburgers
and look like you?

09:43.419 --> 09:45.433
No, sometimes we get chili fries, too.

09:45.505 --> 09:47.220
Why, what are you eating?

09:49.990 --> 09:52.660
Oh, um, it's a Zone meal.
It's low carb.

09:53.660 --> 09:58.430
Oh, so we were just in the middle of planning our girl's
night out for this weekend. Do you want to join us?

09:58.760 --> 09:59.510
Me?

10:01.278 --> 10:02.819
What do you say?

10:04.758 --> 10:06.061
Okay, sure.

10:06.638 --> 10:10.224
Break it down for me, guys.
And don't be afraid to be honest.

10:10.230 --> 10:11.751
What you should have done
is tell her,

10:12.252 --> 10:17.868
take all the space you need. I know
this must be hard. Boom! You're a hero.

10:17.899 --> 10:20.376
You look confident,
but like you still care.

10:20.380 --> 10:22.723
That is so the way I should have played it.

10:22.916 --> 10:25.395
When do we discuss
the new Avengers?

10:25.612 --> 10:30.403
Okay, Philip, your membership has been revoked. Now
you're not there for me, I'm not there for you. Beat it.

10:30.436 --> 10:32.324
Philip, he doesn't mean it. He's just upset.

10:32.330 --> 10:34.513
No, you, two. I don't care
if you're still in junior high.

10:34.522 --> 10:37.082
I think you're on to something.
I like it. You know what?

10:37.105 --> 10:39.676
I'm going to give her a call,
tell her I'm giving her some space.

10:39.683 --> 10:41.388
No, no, Seth,
Dude, don't do that.

10:47.972 --> 10:49.504
- What's happening?
- He's calling her.

10:49.512 --> 10:54.093
- What?! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Give me that.
- What? What? It's going to voice mail. I'm leaving a message.

10:55.546 --> 10:59.046
Geez, man, fine, whatever. Forget calling her anyways,
I'm going to go down there.

10:59.272 --> 11:01.829
If I'm going to lose her, I deserve to see the guy
I'm losing her to.

11:01.837 --> 11:03.660
- You are not going down there.
- Yeah, I have to, okay?

11:03.661 --> 11:07.284
My paycheck is down there. Yes, yes!
That's perfect.

11:07.293 --> 11:09.937
She owes me $38.
I have to go down there, okay?

11:09.942 --> 11:12.708
How am I supposed to live without that money?
A man's got to eat.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.164
- What if I go down there?
- And I come with you? Okay.

11:15.167 --> 11:20.176
Look, I'll go down there. I'll say I'm picking
up your paycheck, sniff around for the ex.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.140
Okay. Check him out, report back to me?
Maybe snap a few photos?

11:23.142 --> 11:25.145
- Sure, what do you say?
- Yeah, all right.

11:25.161 --> 11:28.370
Listen, Seth, you've got to apologize to Phil, man.
He took that really hard.

11:28.374 --> 11:31.204
Philip, he's always been the weak one.

11:31.212 --> 11:36.214
Hey, Philip, come on, man. I'm sorry about what
happened back there. Heat of passion, you know how it is?

11:36.216 --> 11:39.342
I'm sorry, sometimes Bruce Banner
turns into the Hulk..

11:41.749 --> 11:45.848
Hey, I talked to the guys over at the Housing
Initiative. They are on cloud nine over there.

11:46.242 --> 11:47.341
Cool. Good.

11:47.368 --> 11:51.278
They're going to draw up a proposal
for you to bring to work.

11:51.478 --> 11:55.854
Okay, honey, I don't want to alarm you,
but there is a giant Julie Cooper on the table.

11:55.886 --> 11:59.226
It's Julie's idea for the image makeover.
A magazine.

11:59.241 --> 12:01.465
I'm assuming you nipped
this one in the bud?

12:01.474 --> 12:06.660
Well, she did her homework,
ran the numbers. The proposal wasn't bad.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.803
You're not actually
considering this, are you?

12:08.806 --> 12:11.541
Well, there's a lot of ideas on the table, Sandy.

12:11.666 --> 12:16.239
Well, when you shoot down hers, be sure to toss this, will you?
It's giving me the willies.

12:25.455 --> 12:28.204
I'm here to pick up a paycheck,
name is Cohen.

12:28.467 --> 12:31.248
So you must be Alex's new guy.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.130
The famous Seth Cohen.

12:33.243 --> 12:36.637
No, I'm his friend, Ryan.
I'm just doing him a favor.

12:38.156 --> 12:40.786
Oh, I really wanted
to meet this Seth.

12:42.101 --> 12:43.404
I'm Jodi.

12:47.553 --> 12:49.119
You're the ex.

12:49.144 --> 12:51.975
So you didn't see
anything at the club?

12:51.987 --> 12:55.844
I mean, there were no shady guys
hanging around Alex's office?

12:55.849 --> 13:00.967
Definitely didn't see any guys. Uh, are we
meeting Zach here or at the comic book store?

13:00.972 --> 13:05.575
Here. Now, you must have seen someone.
Tell me this, who gave you the check?

13:05.582 --> 13:10.992
Tell me everything that happened.
In fact, better yet, reenact it, word for word. Go.

13:13.631 --> 13:16.428
Zach! Hey! How are you?
So good to see ya.

13:16.432 --> 13:17.637
Good. I'm good.

13:19.713 --> 13:23.542
I'm terrible, actually. Uh...
I think I freaked Summer out.

13:23.596 --> 13:29.294
I don't know, she bailed on our date, and now she's
doing some girls'- night-out thing at The Bait Shop.

13:29.296 --> 13:33.708
She's not returning any of my phone calls.
I don't know, maybe some new comics will ease the pain.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.008
I feel that pain...

13:35.011 --> 13:38.253
so why don't we go down to The Bait Shop
tonight and give the girls a little talking to?

13:38.254 --> 13:43.022
Or we could forget about the girls, you know?
Do our own thing. Have a guys' night out.

13:43.815 --> 13:45.519
I like my plan, where we go to The Bait Shop.

13:45.532 --> 13:48.660
Oh, come on, we spend every night with the girls.
Let's try one night without them.

13:48.681 --> 13:50.676
It could be kind of fun.

13:53.701 --> 13:57.768
It could be just what I need...
a reinvestment in my manhood.

13:57.925 --> 14:01.742
A time-out to reflect what it means
to be a man.

14:02.126 --> 14:03.583
Yeah, I'm in.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.008
Sanford.

14:05.697 --> 14:09.638
Uh... I was hoping to have
a bit of a chat with you both.

14:09.652 --> 14:12.785
It's about this ungodly magazine
of Julie's. You heard about it?

14:12.803 --> 14:16.313
Heard about it? I got an 80-foot mockup
in my kitchen.

14:16.328 --> 14:20.006
- It's gonna haunt me in my sleep.
- Well, I don't intend to let this thing go ahead.

14:20.035 --> 14:24.488
If Julie launches this magazine, she'll
embarrass herself, the company, the family.

14:24.513 --> 14:26.461
So how are you gonna break it to her?

14:26.647 --> 14:29.863
The woman's a warrior, Sanford.
I'm not facing her alone.

14:29.866 --> 14:31.296
Oh, so that's
where we come in.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.673
The three of us
form a united front,

14:33.674 --> 14:37.945
tell Julie that the magazine
is a terrible idea, that she'll regret it.

14:37.961 --> 14:41.716
- What do you say?
- How about that? I actually agree with you.

14:42.650 --> 14:44.123
Relax, you're gonna have fun.

14:44.131 --> 14:48.151
Yeah, definitely. I mean, not only am I spending
the night with Marissa,

14:48.152 --> 14:51.812
but I'll get to see my dad,
who barely acknowledges me.

14:51.814 --> 14:55.469
Nope, he's gonna be out
at dinner. I checked with Marissa.

14:57.061 --> 15:02.783
So, when did you... guys meet?
I mean, how'd you start going out in the first place?

15:02.816 --> 15:04.611
Me and Marissa? Come on.

15:04.624 --> 15:07.943
What? I mean, were you guys
lab partners?

15:08.675 --> 15:11.165
Fire drill buddies?

15:14.234 --> 15:16.925
actually it was
my first night in Newport.

15:18.389 --> 15:23.676
I was, uh... I was sitting in Sandy's car, waiting
to see if Kirsten would even let me in the house,

15:24.609 --> 15:27.009
and... I walked down to the
end of the driveway,

15:27.751 --> 15:29.326
and... there she was.

15:33.056 --> 15:35.513
We started talking, and...

15:37.741 --> 15:42.366
.. I don't know, we just, uh...
connected.

15:43.631 --> 15:46.825
She wasn't like anybody
I'd ever met before.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.891
Till you.

15:54.525 --> 15:55.540
Right

16:02.802 --> 16:04.381
Have fun.

16:08.112 --> 16:10.379
Hey, do me a favor,
take care of her tonight, all right?

16:10.404 --> 16:12.872
Okay, Ryan,
I'm not eight.

16:13.573 --> 16:17.381
I promise I'll take care
of her, Dad. Or I'll try anyway.

16:24.827 --> 16:27.883
Uh, please don't feel like
you have to baby-sit me.

16:27.890 --> 16:32.055
Oh, no, that's just Ryan.
He gets very protective. You'll see.

16:34.936 --> 16:37.531
Uh, so Summer should be here
any second.

16:37.986 --> 16:38.758
'Kay.

16:40.862 --> 16:43.608
Uh, so this is where you live.

16:44.823 --> 16:49.533
I mean, of... course it is.
I mean, it's... it's really nice.

16:50.184 --> 16:51.752
Thanks.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.245
Yeah,
sit.

17:04.220 --> 17:05.848
Hey, you know what?

17:07.515 --> 17:09.939
Um... how about
an icebreaker?

17:11.592 --> 17:13.946
- Oh, uh... I don't... I don't really..
- Sorry.

17:14.198 --> 17:18.373
- That's totally cool.
- Oh, not that I-I judge anyone who does,

17:18.385 --> 17:21.380
- it's just not something...
- Don't worry about it.

17:36.188 --> 17:41.478
That must be Summer, so I'll just go grab the door. You know, hang out,
make yourself comfortable.

18:13.946 --> 18:15.678
What am I doing here?

18:17.012 --> 18:22.559
Okay, it is 0700 hours. Let the record show
that guys' night out has officially begun.

18:22.585 --> 18:25.897
Okay, Seth, uh, 0700 means it's 7:00 a. m.

18:26.336 --> 18:29.372
Okay, nobody cares that you were in ROTC.
Now, listen to me...

18:29.400 --> 18:34.747
tonight, Newport is our bitch, okay? So
let's go out there and let's do what guys do.

18:35.652 --> 18:37.833
Ryan, what do guys do?

18:39.092 --> 18:43.932
Oh, we could head out to L.A. You know, hit
a club. Go to Vegas. Road trip to Tijuana?

18:43.935 --> 18:48.856
Okay, that didn't work out so well last time,
but these are good shapes of ideas.

18:53.616 --> 18:56.324
- You want to stay home and play video games, don't you?
- So bad.

18:56.337 --> 18:59.754
Yeah, this Summer thing has got me tied in knots, man.
I vote we stay in.

18:59.784 --> 19:02.963
I vote we stay in. Well, we should get you out
of the house. It'll take your mind off things.

19:03.302 --> 19:07.877
Or, or, we could let the fun come to us, okay? We
have everything we need here for a perfect night, okay?

19:07.882 --> 19:11.368
We've got a working television, a
bevy of comic books, lamps... right?

19:11.706 --> 19:17.764
Okay. That's all you need for a rollicking
good time, so my proposal is guys' night in.

19:20.088 --> 19:21.479
Guys' night in.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.080
So here we are, just us.

19:28.343 --> 19:29.333
Right.

19:36.545 --> 19:37.974
This is so much fun.

19:40.795 --> 19:43.255
So, what happens now?

19:45.461 --> 19:48.507
Well, we could walk by the bar,
see if anyone checks us out.

19:48.570 --> 19:51.356
Hello!? No boys tonight,
that's the whole point.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.527
Okay, well, we can at least talk
about them, right?

19:54.628 --> 19:57.248
'Cause let's face it, without that,
we got nothing.

19:57.336 --> 20:00.661
So, boy talk. Who wants
to start?

20:04.589 --> 20:09.905
You know, um... I've been thinking,
the whole sobriety thing.

20:10.635 --> 20:12.553
You've read my mind.

20:26.920 --> 20:30.493
Maybe some tonic
and lots of ice would help.

20:31.902 --> 20:32.717
You okay?

20:32.742 --> 20:34.459
Yeah, it burns a little.

20:35.763 --> 20:38.831
Do what you want.
If you need to call him so bad.

20:38.837 --> 20:41.924
What? Look, I had no idea that you were gonna show up
out of nowhere,

20:41.925 --> 20:44.418
and I didn't have any chance
to tell him anything about us.

20:44.422 --> 20:47.038
Why? are you embarassed about us?

20:47.047 --> 20:52.567
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh,
there's no paper towels in the girl's bathroom.

20:53.546 --> 20:54.741
Uh, I'm all over it.

21:01.425 --> 21:04.461
Thanks. That was a conversation
that I did not want to have.

21:04.466 --> 21:08.038
Yeah, I know all about those.
I have them with my mom all the time.

21:08.055 --> 21:11.666
I mean, the nerve of Alex! She has
a secret boyfriend the whole time,

21:11.677 --> 21:14.467
- and she just never gets around to telling me?
- I know, man.

21:14.478 --> 21:18.574
All I wanted was to celebrate
our six-month anniversary, and Summer heads for the hills.

21:18.589 --> 21:20.101
You and Summer have been going
out for six months?

21:20.103 --> 21:22.434
This is so not how I imagined
our guys' night out.

21:22.435 --> 21:25.682
- I say we go to the club, and we put up a fight.
- No, bad idea.

21:25.695 --> 21:29.381
Why? Our girlfriends bailed
on us to go drinking at a club.

21:29.384 --> 21:33.124
Have you seen the infomercials for Girls Gone
Wild? 'Cause this is exactly how they begin.

21:33.129 --> 21:34.987
- He's right. I'm going.
- Me, too.

21:34.989 --> 21:38.033
Seth, I'm telling you
as your friend, don't do this.

21:39.447 --> 21:42.328
- You know something, don't you?
- No, no, I don't. Don't ask me.

21:42.333 --> 21:47.034
Dude, I am a man in the desert.
I am dying of thirst. You have a thermos full of Kool-Aid?

21:47.056 --> 21:50.092
Come on, give me a sip.
Did you meet the ex? I know you did

21:50.095 --> 21:52.005
All right, yes, I did.

21:52.055 --> 21:53.830
- And? Who is he?
- He?

21:55.314 --> 21:56.949
He's a she.

21:57.620 --> 21:58.342
What?

22:22.911 --> 22:24.335
Who needs a little more?

22:24.596 --> 22:27.524
- Somebody's got to drive.
- Not me.

22:28.046 --> 22:30.393
Why don't I go
track down some coffee?

22:37.735 --> 22:39.219
You're not scary.

22:40.245 --> 22:41.254
Uh, thanks, I think.

22:41.262 --> 22:46.393
Yeah, I mean, like, before, you were, like, scary.
Not like boogie-man scary, you know, but...

22:46.399 --> 22:49.007
Lindsay, you've got nothing
to worry about.

22:50.195 --> 22:51.906
Ryan really likes you.

22:54.995 --> 22:58.257
Can a guy ever get over a girl
like you?

23:02.627 --> 23:04.506
Summer, right?

23:05.395 --> 23:07.400
We're in the same
comp lit class together..

23:07.413 --> 23:08.543
Right.

23:09.470 --> 23:12.752
- I'm sorry, I'm usually asleep.
- Matt Miller.

23:12.864 --> 23:15.570
So, where's, uh, where's Zach?

23:15.858 --> 23:19.744
I don't know.
It's a girl's night out.

23:19.894 --> 23:21.153
You know about me and Zach?

23:21.159 --> 23:23.946
Oh, we're on the water polo team together.
Happy anniversary.

23:23.950 --> 23:25.488
You know about our anniversary?

23:25.492 --> 23:30.002
Well, yeah, he brought it up in the locker room.
Six months is big. We were all talking about it.

23:30.008 --> 23:33.705
So Zach's turning the locker room
into a Lifetime movie?

23:33.716 --> 23:36.389
The water polo team
is very sensitive.

23:37.366 --> 23:39.508
It's tough to see from here.

23:39.558 --> 23:42.360
Yeah, uh, always tough
to see from here.

23:42.478 --> 23:43.768
You want to try upstairs?

23:44.344 --> 23:47.500
Yeah, sure, why not?
Haven't scoped it out yet.

23:49.294 --> 23:51.737
So Alex hooked up with a girl.
It's not a big deal, Seth.

23:51.751 --> 23:55.129
Ryan, my girlfriend dated a girl.
It's a very big deal.

23:55.130 --> 23:59.167
- There's only one thing I can do to make it okay.
- Going to hook up with a guy?

23:59.969 --> 24:04.335
I repeat, there's only one thing I can do to make it okay.
I need to see this girl,

24:04.385 --> 24:07.002
'cause right now, my imagination's
just running wild.

24:07.005 --> 24:09.615
Dude, so is mine. She's hot, right?

24:09.647 --> 24:12.690
Listen, I know I'm supposed
to be attracted, okay,

24:12.692 --> 24:15.353
and I'm supposed to be turned on.
I've read Maxim, I've read Stuff,

24:15.354 --> 24:19.158
but you know what? All it's making me feel
like is Alex is even more out of my league.

24:19.163 --> 24:21.624
Maybe you should just wait to talk to her
till you calm down a little bit.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.845
Nope, got a lot of testosterone
pumping right now, Ryan...

24:23.846 --> 24:27.791
testosterone being the key ingredient
missing from Alex's previous relationship.

24:27.795 --> 24:29.862
I just need to remind her of that.

24:29.872 --> 24:31.129
Come on!

24:31.367 --> 24:32.645
This should go well.

24:32.946 --> 24:34.237
I hate traffic.

24:34.299 --> 24:37.691
But you have to think big picture,
because this magazine could go national.

24:37.692 --> 24:40.105
Why wouldn't America
be fascinated

24:40.106 --> 24:42.211
with the lives and loves of Orange County's
rich and fabulous?

24:42.222 --> 24:44.301
We're all beautiful,
and we're all dysfunctional.

24:44.341 --> 24:49.005
Surf, sex and scandal... it's a recipe for
a cultural phenomenon, don't you think, Cal?

24:49.026 --> 24:52.425
Well, I would rather hear what, uh, Sandy and Kirsten
have to say.

24:52.463 --> 24:54.318
Let's-let's not talk
about work anymore.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.993
Kirsten, why don't we put her
out of her misery?

24:59.561 --> 25:02.143
Julie, it's a lousy idea.

25:04.889 --> 25:07.574
Thanks for rushing to my defense, Cal.
Really, very touching.

25:07.599 --> 25:11.824
Oh, it's, uh... my job to remain impartial,
objective.

25:11.874 --> 25:12.952
And cowardly?

25:13.617 --> 25:16.716
Fine. I'll just sit here
and get insulted by a man

25:16.717 --> 25:20.273
so ignorant about business,
he chose as a career to work for free.

25:20.287 --> 25:21.858
I- I-I don't... I don't work...

25:22.012 --> 25:24.983
That's pro bono work, Julie.
Why am I defending myself?

25:24.989 --> 25:27.522
If you want a business
perspective, ask Kirsten.

25:27.528 --> 25:31.188
I did. She called Newport Living
just the thing

25:31.189 --> 25:33.775
to keep the Newport Group living.

25:33.785 --> 25:37.516
- She said that?
- I-I wasn't that poetic.

25:38.268 --> 25:43.661
Oh, honey, I-I-I did some research. This has
promise. I'm so sorry it had to come out this way.

25:43.674 --> 25:47.123
No, it's my fault. I've once again
let myself

25:47.124 --> 25:50.685
get caught up in the middle of this...
nasty game of Hungry,Hungry Hippos.

25:50.687 --> 25:53.493
Well, this time, I'm out.
You're all on your own.

25:53.613 --> 25:55.990
Waiter? He'll take the check.

25:59.198 --> 26:01.615
- Okay, I'm going to check the bar.
- I'll look upstairs.

26:01.618 --> 26:03.272
Seth, we can
still turn around.

26:03.276 --> 26:04.605
Yeah, that's a good idea, Ryan.

26:05.896 --> 26:07.556
You take the lounge.

26:27.173 --> 26:30.325
So, where is she?
'Cause I will totally fight a girl.

26:30.327 --> 26:32.486
I have a job, which I'm busy doing,

26:32.487 --> 26:36.134
so if you came down here for some big, dramatic
confrontation, it's going to have to wait.

26:36.138 --> 26:38.360
Fine! I will wait!

26:44.877 --> 26:48.351
I don't know what my problem is.
I just get so claustrophobic.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.329
Sounds to me like maybe
you don't want a boyfriend.

26:50.336 --> 26:53.980
Well, if he's not right for me,
then nobody is.

27:00.556 --> 27:04.129
Zach, what are you doing here? I thought tonight
was the night for the girls to be without the boys.

27:04.135 --> 27:08.663
It doesn't look like it. What are you doing here with
Matt Miller? That guy'll hit on anything that moves.

27:08.667 --> 27:11.686
Oh, thanks for the news flash, O'Reilly.
What, are you, like, making your rounds?

27:11.699 --> 27:14.136
Yeah, yep, that's what I'm doing.
I'm checking up on you.

27:14.141 --> 27:18.942
- Okay, then why are you here?
- I don't know. Bad idea.

27:31.439 --> 27:34.636
- There you are.
- Hi, there you are!

27:40.932 --> 27:43.346
My numb is tongue.

27:43.365 --> 27:44.648
She drunk?

27:46.372 --> 27:48.487
Mm, I think that I need some fresh air.

27:48.491 --> 27:51.447
Uh, that's a good idea.
Let's get you out of here.

27:52.329 --> 27:53.513
Bye.

28:05.318 --> 28:09.480
- Julie took off?
- She insisted on me putting her in a cab.

28:10.212 --> 28:13.946
Apparently, it is my husbandly duty
to support her ideas.

28:13.965 --> 28:15.438
She's got a point.

28:15.798 --> 28:19.919
Support each other no matter what.
That's the name of the game.

28:20.483 --> 28:23.304
Which is why I'm going
to support Sandy at the board meeting.

28:23.310 --> 28:25.719
Putting the marriage
ahead of the company...

28:26.361 --> 28:27.567
Bold move.

28:27.671 --> 28:29.613
Go with Julie on this one.

28:30.407 --> 28:32.124
You won't regret it.

28:33.820 --> 28:37.462
You know, you're not as stubborn
as everybody thinks you are.

28:37.486 --> 28:39.606
Nah, it's just too much wine.

28:41.058 --> 28:42.454
So, how you feeling?

28:43.171 --> 28:45.345
Oh, I feel so great.

28:45.995 --> 28:47.503
Let's go swimming.

28:47.648 --> 28:48.733
Come on.

28:49.255 --> 28:51.365
Hey, hey, swimming,
in the ocean, at night?

28:51.381 --> 28:53.373
Yeah, what's the matter?
Are you scared?

28:53.377 --> 28:53.916
No.

28:56.203 --> 28:57.085
You all right?

29:01.206 --> 29:02.925
Oh, geez.
How much you drink, huh?

29:02.927 --> 29:05.415
I don't know,
as much as Marissa.

29:06.067 --> 29:09.490
- That's a lot.
- Well, I am on a liquid diet tonight.

29:09.499 --> 29:11.331
No dinner, too, huh?

29:12.213 --> 29:15.092
Well, in that case...
you hang tight for a minute.

29:15.413 --> 29:20.370
I'm going to go grab some greasy fries and a
lot of coffee. Oh... The Ryan Atwood special.

29:20.374 --> 29:23.957
- Fries sound so good.
- Don't they?

29:23.965 --> 29:28.651
And then we'll go swimming. It'll be fun, because
when the weather is cold, the water is warm.

29:28.664 --> 29:31.674
All right, we'll talk
about it when I get back.

29:32.460 --> 29:34.359
All right. Stay there.
You okay?

29:55.259 --> 29:57.751
Are you trying to wait me out?
'Cause it's not working.

29:57.753 --> 30:00.308
It is working; that's
why you're not waiting.

30:00.659 --> 30:04.962
Okay, let's just get this over with... come on in
and tell me everything that I've done to wrong you.

30:04.966 --> 30:06.880
Okay, uh, for one,
you lied to me.

30:06.920 --> 30:11.331
I did not lie to you. I told you that my ex
was in town, and you filled in the blanks.

30:11.333 --> 30:13.644
Blanks that you left blank.

30:13.734 --> 30:17.325
You know, it's part of your move.
It's kind of part of what you do.

30:17.366 --> 30:20.458
You got your whole too-cool, Jem and
the Holograms thing happening, and I feel

30:20.459 --> 30:23.142
like you consistently blowing me off
is part of your act.

30:23.148 --> 30:25.323
- So now you think its an act?
- I think it's a crutch

30:25.336 --> 30:28.895
with the hair and the tattoos and the whisky
and cigarettes for breakfast.

30:28.896 --> 30:34.042
You know, I've actually seen The Banger Sisters...
part of it, on cable... and I know how the story ends.

30:34.046 --> 30:38.147
Well, I'll make sure to Netflix that this weekend
so I can be up to speed on your little theory.

30:38.150 --> 30:42.392
Great, you do that.
Point is, this was really fun for a while,

30:42.393 --> 30:45.446
but it is just not worth it,
so I will see you.

30:47.547 --> 30:48.803
So, what are you going to do?

30:48.818 --> 30:54.442
I don't know. Maybe I'll find a new girl to
walk all over me or maybe even be cool to me.

31:57.013 --> 31:59.941
Ryan! What are you doing?!

31:59.972 --> 32:02.540
Lindsay! She's out here, Seth!

32:02.853 --> 32:05.793
- Get help!
- Lindsay's fine!

32:05.953 --> 32:07.002
What?!

32:07.045 --> 32:10.006
I just saw her!
She's fine! She's passed out!

32:10.007 --> 32:12.418
They took her to Alex's office!

32:16.066 --> 32:20.203
I guess she went looking for you.
I ran into Marissa, who was doing the same thing.

32:20.226 --> 32:22.109
Yeah? I can't wait to see her.

32:25.657 --> 32:27.573
What happened to you?

32:28.262 --> 32:31.794
- Is she okay?
- She'll be fine. She's just sleeping it off.

32:31.845 --> 32:33.022
I should get her home.

32:33.032 --> 32:35.471
- I can do that.
- I think you've done enough.

32:35.629 --> 32:38.167
Oh, okay, so this is the part
where you blame it all on me?

32:38.186 --> 32:41.437
You're right; it was Lindsay's idea
to pound straight vodka and pass out.

32:41.443 --> 32:44.474
- Feel good to see someone else messed up for a change?
- It was her idea.

32:44.538 --> 32:47.398
And okay, so it got a little out of control.

32:47.400 --> 32:52.270
It always does with you! You spent all last year
trying to drag me down with you, and now her?

32:56.508 --> 32:59.101
You want to make a mess
out of your own life? Fine!

33:00.416 --> 33:03.736
- You're doing a pretty good job of it, if you ask me.
- No one asked you.

33:03.742 --> 33:05.401
What did you say?!

33:05.602 --> 33:06.906
Hey, Ryan, let's, let's go.

33:06.966 --> 33:10.225
- I'm not leaving her here.
- I'll take care of her; you go.

33:10.278 --> 33:12.184
Yeah, come on. It'll be fine.

33:14.803 --> 33:16.007
Ryan, let's go.

33:23.361 --> 33:25.738
Just call and let us know she's okay.

33:35.505 --> 33:36.889
Let's get her out of here.

33:50.063 --> 33:52.550
Hey, uh, black and white
milk shake, please.

33:54.004 --> 33:54.887
One.

34:23.716 --> 34:26.795
So... I'm sorry for being
Ultra Bitch 2,000 tonight.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.031
- "Tonight"?
- Fair enough.

34:29.091 --> 34:33.355
It's just that... my whole dating experience
amounts to

34:33.356 --> 34:37.262
a six-month angst fest
with cuckoo-for-Cohen.

34:37.697 --> 34:41.833
So, when I'm with you...
someone who is sane and normal...

34:41.835 --> 34:44.420
it's like I was raised by wolves.

34:46.047 --> 34:47.614
Do you need the drama?

34:47.636 --> 34:52.985
Well, if by that you mean do I
miss the wolves? No.

34:53.152 --> 34:56.670
See, wolves... they pee all over the place
marking their territory.

34:56.710 --> 34:57.657
Gross.

34:58.539 --> 34:59.271
But...

34:59.624 --> 35:04.499
while I'm learning
how to not howl at the moon,

35:04.500 --> 35:06.771
I need to take baby steps.

35:07.974 --> 35:10.930
- Like this anniversary thing?
- I got it.

35:11.112 --> 35:16.852
And don't worry, if we're still together when we hit
the one-year mark, I'm going to totally blow it off.

35:16.946 --> 35:20.785
I think that is the sweetest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

35:36.013 --> 35:38.633
Alex called. Lindsay's home.

35:41.391 --> 35:42.692
Everything okay?

35:43.632 --> 35:49.289
I assume so. We didn't really have a long talk.
She hung up on me.

35:49.715 --> 35:52.724
Which is maybe a hint that I really screwed
things up tonight.

35:53.288 --> 35:56.833
I don't think me and Marissa
will be hanging out anytime soon.

35:58.541 --> 36:00.923
Mmm. I was probably
too hard on her, huh?

36:01.691 --> 36:06.580
- There were flashes of the old Ryan Atwood.
- It's just that it brings back old issues, you know?

36:06.680 --> 36:07.959
Marissa, my mom.

36:07.960 --> 36:12.564
I don't think you have to lump Lindsay in that category,
though. She's probably just trying to let loose.

36:12.571 --> 36:15.083
Or Marissa pressured her into it.

36:16.153 --> 36:20.498
I think that if Lindsay was feeling any pressure,
it was probably coming from you.

36:20.547 --> 36:23.926
I mean, you kind of shotgunned
them into that relationship.

36:23.927 --> 36:28.784
But I mean, the girlfriend and the ex as
friends... I think that goes against nature.

36:29.561 --> 36:33.330
Mmm. Sounds like someone
could follow their own advice.

36:33.792 --> 36:36.982
Yeah, I should apologize.
It's just my pride.

36:38.270 --> 36:39.315
What pride?

36:39.486 --> 36:41.316
Yeah, I guess there's nothing
standing in my way.

36:41.319 --> 36:42.995
- So, do you want to drive, or me?
- You.

36:43.000 --> 36:43.589
All right.

36:57.963 --> 37:00.781
If you're still angry,
you have every right to be.

37:00.811 --> 37:02.693
No, well, that's
good to know.

37:02.903 --> 37:06.013
But here's the thing.
I'm not angry at all.

37:06.221 --> 37:11.123
Ever since I left the law firm, your
father's been grooming me to be his henchman,

37:11.441 --> 37:13.151
and I've been letting him.

37:13.450 --> 37:17.328
I think in some way, I've just been
postponing the inevitable.

37:17.337 --> 37:18.413
And that is?

37:21.136 --> 37:23.149
Figuring out what to do next.

37:24.184 --> 37:29.660
Sandy, we can still make your housing idea work.
I'm going to go on record recommending the project.

37:29.737 --> 37:30.883
I appreciate that.

37:34.148 --> 37:35.600
But I'd rather you didn't.

37:38.658 --> 37:41.764
Julie's magazine is always going to give
me the heebie jeebies,

37:41.765 --> 37:44.815
and business-wise,
it's probably your best bet.

37:45.241 --> 37:48.619
Besides, if I work with you,
your father

37:48.620 --> 37:51.723
will ambush us every time we try
to have a date.

37:51.744 --> 37:54.703
That was the worst date
we've ever had, wasn't it?

37:55.649 --> 37:58.944
A double date with your father
and Julie Cooper.

37:59.834 --> 38:01.978
Sounds like the plot
of this movie.

38:06.089 --> 38:10.952
Maybe we shouldn't both be here. I mean, it's
potentially too much apology for one doorstep.

38:11.009 --> 38:12.787
We're not doing it
at the same time.

38:12.825 --> 38:16.864
That's good, 'cause I don't think
the synchronized apology would work.

38:23.922 --> 38:25.701
It's like you're stalking me.

38:25.706 --> 38:28.186
Yeah, but I'm stalking you
with good intentions.

38:28.862 --> 38:31.637
- I came to apologize.
- So did I.

38:32.447 --> 38:34.151
Marissa's inside.

38:34.389 --> 38:35.892
Thanks.

38:36.845 --> 38:41.956
And so is Jodi, so you and me...
are outside.

38:56.832 --> 38:59.025
Look, I don't know.
I, I...

39:00.903 --> 39:05.860
I guess I was hoping this could be easy... for you and
me to stay friends, for you and Lindsay to be friends.

39:05.863 --> 39:08.241
And have us all
live happily ever after?

39:08.254 --> 39:11.118
Yeah, something like that.

39:12.842 --> 39:16.756
I know it seems like a million years ago we dated,
but it wasn't.

39:16.769 --> 39:19.115
And okay, maybe you're over it.

39:19.193 --> 39:22.247
Maybe it doesn't mean anything
to you anymore.

39:23.362 --> 39:26.043
Maybe it never did.

39:29.437 --> 39:31.864
But it meant a lot to me.

39:33.180 --> 39:35.221
You meant a lot to me.

39:35.503 --> 39:36.968
You still do.

39:41.386 --> 39:43.252
It's not like that. I...

39:43.891 --> 39:45.945
I don't know what it's like.

39:45.983 --> 39:49.522
And thinking you and Lindsay
should be friends was a bad idea.

39:49.582 --> 39:51.473
Why? I like her.

39:52.829 --> 39:55.547
And if you do the math,
she's my stepsister, so...

39:56.349 --> 39:57.100
I guess.

40:06.472 --> 40:11.044
- Clearly, it's going to be strange for us for awhile.
- Yeah, I know, you're right

40:17.362 --> 40:18.740
I'm sorry.

40:23.011 --> 40:25.159
That's what I came here to say..

40:26.950 --> 40:28.566
I'm sorry, too.

40:37.516 --> 40:38.843
So, you and Jodi?

40:39.670 --> 40:41.677
You getting back together?

40:42.265 --> 40:43.643
Uh, I doubt it.

40:45.247 --> 40:47.188
She's kind of a pain in the ass.

40:47.940 --> 40:50.560
- But maybe that's my type.
- Right.

40:51.512 --> 40:57.901
So then, does that mean that we can go back to
before? 'Cause I could forget this ever happened.

40:58.742 --> 41:00.070
Okay, I'll wait.

41:01.535 --> 41:05.080
'Cause that's what adults do.
They wait,

41:05.155 --> 41:06.270
so I'm waiting. Adult style.

41:10.143 --> 41:11.095
You ready?

41:16.331 --> 41:17.897
Yeah, I guess so.

41:22.659 --> 41:24.250
thanks for coming by.

41:26.933 --> 41:28.649
And I'm sorry, too.

41:50.563 --> 41:52.079
Hey. Jodi went to sleep.

41:52.124 --> 41:55.399
Cool. I think we've seen
the last of the guys.

41:55.410 --> 42:00.031
I wouldn't be so sure. There's still like, what,
four minutes of girl's night out left?

42:01.370 --> 42:03.976
I've had enough of girls and guys

42:04.317 --> 42:06.411
There's an old horror movie on.

42:09.566 --> 42:10.558
Works for me.

42:16.701 --> 42:17.762
Mmm.. Are you cold?
