00:18.186 --> 00:19.553
Him on the ball,

00:19.653 --> 00:21.155
from Dunbar.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.990
He junior college now,
but he goin' bigger places

00:23.091 --> 00:25.659
if he can make
them grades, yo.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.333
He our edge,
right there.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.903
Where he going?

00:36.003 --> 00:38.572
I don't know.
Terps, Hoyas,

00:38.672 --> 00:40.908
Missouri, Kansas,
they all want this cat.

00:41.008 --> 00:42.410
Okay, so,
we in the mix too now.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.679
You know
what I'm talkin' about?

00:45.779 --> 00:47.014
Blow Proposition
Joe's mind.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.616
He ain't got nobody
ballin' like this.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.618
He better not
have one motherfucker
ballin' like this.

00:50.718 --> 00:51.819
I'm sick
and tired of losing

00:51.919 --> 00:53.254
to these Eastside bitches
every year.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.688
It's been three years
runnin' now, man.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.658
Fuckin' with
my morale, for real.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.396
What happened
to the faggot?

01:02.496 --> 01:03.997
Omar?

01:04.098 --> 01:05.866
That nigger
in the wind, man.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.102
Yo, what you mean
he in the wind, man?

01:08.202 --> 01:10.404
This city
ain't that big.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.441
You know what
that nigger do

01:13.541 --> 01:16.043
when he hole up
somewhere?

01:16.144 --> 01:18.045
He peeled off
one or two packages,

01:18.146 --> 01:19.413
roll around
the neighborhood,

01:19.513 --> 01:21.549
givin' away
free vials and shit.

01:21.649 --> 01:24.218
Oh, yeah, on some real
Robin Hood type shit.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.554
If we try
and get at him,

01:26.654 --> 01:29.157
we gonna have
two dozen niggers sayin'
that we on our way.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.925
If you want us to hunt
that nigger, we gonna hunt.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.128
But the smart play,
I think,

01:34.228 --> 01:36.530
we call a truce,

01:36.630 --> 01:39.833
put this thing on hold
for a hot second.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.635
Let the faggot
get comfortable,

01:41.735 --> 01:43.070
and when he do,
he gonna pop out his head.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.605
Boom, we got him.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.740
Yo, what motherfuckers gonna
be sayin' while we waiting?

01:46.840 --> 01:48.609
Hmm?

01:48.709 --> 01:50.844
What people gonna say
when they see this
cocksuckin' faggot

01:50.944 --> 01:52.913
out in the sunshine?

01:53.013 --> 01:55.883
Like it ain't no thing
to take my shit.

01:59.153 --> 02:01.389
( door opens )

02:03.291 --> 02:06.059
Kid's everything
I said he was, huh?

02:06.160 --> 02:07.961
Yeah, he straight.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.130
Yeah, don't know
what we're gonna do
without him next year.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.665
How come
you ain't signed?

02:11.765 --> 02:14.602
Lot of schools
lookin' at me.
I'm listening.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.304
10 large, though,
that ain't bad, right?

02:16.404 --> 02:17.871
Naw, naw,
it ain't.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.941
Well, 10 for the kid,
plus five.

02:21.041 --> 02:24.077
A donation
for the program.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.314
Done.

02:26.414 --> 02:27.415
Good.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.417
Give me 30 from the line
and get out of here.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.852
- Yo, man, good job, baby.
- All right, big guy.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.421
All right, man.

02:35.589 --> 02:38.792
And I assume there's
another five right here,

02:38.892 --> 02:40.294
for making
this happen?

02:40.394 --> 02:42.463
Ain't shit
for free, right?

02:42.563 --> 02:43.697
Yeah.

02:47.368 --> 02:51.372
( theme music playing )

02:53.507 --> 02:55.909
* If you walk
through the garden *

02:57.511 --> 03:01.081
* You better
watch your back *

03:01.181 --> 03:05.152
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

03:05.253 --> 03:07.655
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

03:09.290 --> 03:12.826
* If you walk
through Jesus *

03:12.926 --> 03:16.464
* He'll save your soul

03:16.564 --> 03:20.200
* You gotta
keep the devil *

03:20.301 --> 03:23.771
* Down in the hole

03:23.871 --> 03:27.207
* All the angels sing

03:27.308 --> 03:31.178
* About Jesus' mighty soul

03:31.279 --> 03:35.148
* And they shoot you
with your wing *

03:35.249 --> 03:38.586
* Keep you close
to the Lord *

03:38.686 --> 03:42.490
* Don't pay heed
to temptation *

03:42.590 --> 03:46.560
* Oh, your hands
are so cold *

03:46.660 --> 03:50.230
* You got to
keep the devil *

03:50.331 --> 03:53.967
* Way down in the hole

04:01.942 --> 04:04.612
* Way down in the hole

04:06.046 --> 04:07.981
* Way down in the hole

04:09.350 --> 04:13.354
* Way down in the hole

04:13.454 --> 04:16.290
* Way down in the hole.

04:22.229 --> 04:23.464
So, what you
do for money?

04:23.564 --> 04:24.932
Can't live
without it, right?

04:25.032 --> 04:28.235
You still fucked up behind
that stick-up, man?

04:28.336 --> 04:30.137
Shit ain't on you.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.340
It ain't
on me neither.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.742
Motherfucker who robbed
the stash shot Sterling.

04:34.842 --> 04:38.078
He gonna get got no matter
what you or me do.

04:38.178 --> 04:41.081
I just don't wanna play.
I don't wanna play no more.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.650
All right?

04:42.750 --> 04:45.486
I was thinkin' about goin'
to school over at Edmondson,

04:45.586 --> 04:47.588
ask if they'll let me back in
at the end of the semester.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.157
- What grade?
- Ninth.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.693
Ninth?
Shit, you how old?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.662
- 16.
- 16?

04:54.762 --> 04:57.965
Damn, man, you supposed
to be a junior by now.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.100
I heard
Stinkum got killed.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.536
Yeah.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.507
Damn.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.416
Yo, I said
I don't want to play.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.317
- I heard you.
- I said I don't
want to play.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.853
And you ain't
got to do nothin'.
I heard you.

05:19.953 --> 05:23.023
Take it.
Hurry up, nigger,
people lookin'.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.125
Look here, man,

05:25.225 --> 05:26.527
you a smart
little motherfucker.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.762
You start back up
at Edmondson,

05:28.862 --> 05:31.499
you likely to finish
up at Harvard or some
shit like that.

05:31.599 --> 05:35.102
Believe, B.
And you...

05:36.303 --> 05:38.238
you got a good heart
in there, too.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.107
Not like the rest
of these niggers.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.049
( phone ringing )

05:49.149 --> 05:50.384
Yeah?

05:50.484 --> 05:52.252
Greggs:
Ronnie Mo on
tower phone two.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.621
Right.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.155
Ronnie Mo:
Where the fuck
you at, man?

05:55.255 --> 05:56.790
You comin' to get
this shit or what?

05:56.890 --> 05:58.459
Wee-Bey:
Keep cool,
we makin' rounds.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.893
You know I ain't movin'
like I used to.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.295
A'ight, couple hours,
we be at you.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.764
A'ight.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.066
Wee-Bey pickin' up
at the towers.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.669
In a couple hours,
give or take.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.004
Time enough for us
to make a play.

06:13.807 --> 06:17.978
- What's up with Wallace?
- Nothin'.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.947
Nothin'?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.348
Nothin'.

06:21.449 --> 06:24.452
It's all good,
just leave him be.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.823
( pager beeps )

06:29.923 --> 06:31.191
Damn.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.561
Fuck.

06:33.661 --> 06:37.164
I'm tired of not havin'
a phone up in this joint.

06:37.264 --> 06:39.967
I'll be right back.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.702
Yeah.
Have a nice hike.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.604
Yeah.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.016
( phone rings )

06:56.116 --> 06:58.251
( with Chinese accent )
Hello, you make order?

06:58.351 --> 07:00.454
- Who this?
- You make order?

07:00.554 --> 07:02.790
- Good yockame.
- What?

07:02.890 --> 07:05.425
Oh, no delivery.
You make order,
you come get.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.461
Good yockame,
good noodle.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.030
Extra ketchup.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.367
The fuck was that?

07:14.468 --> 07:16.937
That was
my Korean counterman.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.707
Sounded Chinese.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.144
Like you can fucking
tell the difference.

07:29.416 --> 07:32.586
It's a brave new world
for you, boys.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.157
- Greggs: 12-14.
- Man: 12-14.

07:37.257 --> 07:40.260
- Request a lateral
with 12-08.
- Go ahead, 14.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.629
0-8, can you go
to channel three?

07:41.729 --> 07:45.499
12-08, I got that.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.901
- Greggs: Where you at?
- McCulloh above Preston.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.638
We're on a good pay phone
that the pit boys are now using.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.373
I'm up on the church.
Hang close, boys.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.876
We might have a nice
jackup for you two.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.619
I can't believe these boys
still in business, man.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.354
Tester, testers
comin' in five.

08:07.454 --> 08:08.722
Hey, what's
the new package, man?

08:08.822 --> 08:11.291
Yellow tops.
Shit is the bomb.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.760
Now the shit
is the bomb.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.762
Check it, check it,
check it.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.630
A man who wants
to get high more than
he wants to get clean.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.031
He was doin' good too.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.667
Told you, all that shit
was bullshit, man.

08:19.767 --> 08:20.934
Them meetings
were just fronts.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.003
The man sounded strong,
you know?

08:23.103 --> 08:24.605
Whatever.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.608
- It's about that time.
- Aw, shit.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.076
What happened?

08:29.176 --> 08:32.145
That's the boy that
beat me down, man.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.847
Hey, yo.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.183
These shits right here is
yellow tops and they right.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.986
So, remember where y'all
caught this blast

08:39.086 --> 08:41.589
and tell your
fiend-ass friends.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.123
Line the fuck up.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.492
Back up, back up.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.394
Get to the end
of the line.
What the fuck?

08:47.494 --> 08:49.362
Line the fuck up.

08:49.462 --> 08:50.698
Get the fuck
outta here.

08:50.798 --> 08:53.667
- Damn, fuck y'all.
- There you go.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.669
Hurry up, hurry up.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.470
They're over here.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.239
I got one, girl,
over here.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.041
I got one.
I got one.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.943
You get one?

09:04.511 --> 09:06.513
Hold up, hold up.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.616
Hey, hey,
you catch one?

09:08.716 --> 09:10.651
'Cause, you know,
I got three if you need.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.119
You was
at the meeting

09:12.219 --> 09:14.955
- over at Samuel Morse.
- Mr. One Day man.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.991
- It wasn't even that.
- Stood up though.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.594
So, why you down
at the tester line
if you ain't chasin'?

09:20.694 --> 09:22.696
Tryin' to get my little
nephew off the corner.

09:22.796 --> 09:25.098
His mama sent him up
to Cumberland, you know?

09:25.198 --> 09:28.602
Try to keep him clean
at my grandma's.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.838
He ain't anywhere
near his bottom.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.573
Gotta see that bottom
comin' up at him.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.209
Hard, too,
'cause he's young, 24.

09:36.309 --> 09:40.080
Most people don't get tired
'til they're 35, 40.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.449
How old are you?

09:42.549 --> 09:45.085
Young at heart.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.988
Walon, man.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.857
Bubs.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.867
Give 'em a long rope.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.635
The farther away from
the projects you pop him,

10:01.735 --> 10:03.103
the less risk
to the wire.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.839
- Herc: Hell with the wire.
- Excuse me?

10:05.939 --> 10:09.677
Gotcha, McNulty.
You're too easy.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.786
Freamon:
We can come
at this a few ways.

10:18.886 --> 10:21.789
First thing is
we need the names
of all front companies,

10:21.889 --> 10:24.524
limited partnerships,
LLCs, and all that mess

10:24.624 --> 10:25.759
LLCs?

10:25.859 --> 10:27.627
Limited liability
corporations.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.562
Start with the nightclub
which Barksdale owns.

10:29.663 --> 10:30.831
Look up Orlando's.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.700
By address,
you match it

10:32.800 --> 10:34.567
and you see
it's owned by who?

10:34.668 --> 10:37.070
It's on Baltimore Street,
right?

10:43.811 --> 10:46.714
Got it.
D&B Enterprises.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.515
Hand that over to Prez,
who's gonna get off his ass

10:48.615 --> 10:51.752
and walk on over
to the state office buildings
on Preston Street.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.220
Preston Street?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.122
- Corporate charter office.
- Corporate who?

10:55.222 --> 10:57.825
They have the paperwork
on every corporation

10:57.925 --> 11:00.728
and LLC licensed to do
business in the state.

11:00.828 --> 11:03.630
You look up D&B Enterprises
on the computer.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.598
You're gonna get a little
reel of microfilm.

11:05.699 --> 11:08.468
Pull the corporate charter
papers that way.

11:08.568 --> 11:11.404
Write down
every name you see,

11:11.504 --> 11:13.473
corporate officers,
shareholders,

11:13.573 --> 11:15.208
or more importantly,

11:15.308 --> 11:18.478
the resident agent
on the filing who is
usually a lawyer.

11:18.578 --> 11:22.049
While they use
front names, you know,
as corporate officers,

11:22.149 --> 11:25.118
they'll usually use
the same lawyer to do
the charter filing.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.520
Find that agent's name,
run it through the computer,

11:27.620 --> 11:30.758
find out what
other corporations
he's done the filing for,

11:30.858 --> 11:33.160
and that way we find
other front companies.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.395
While he's doing that,
what do I do?

11:35.495 --> 11:37.530
You're gonna keep your head
in this here assessment book.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.734
Look up any properties that
you can connect to Barksdale.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.436
How do you know it connects
to Barksdale, right?

11:43.536 --> 11:44.838
For one thing,

11:44.938 --> 11:46.273
you work off of
what Prez gets you

11:46.373 --> 11:47.908
from the corporate
charter documents.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.276
Whatever companies
he links to Barksdale

11:49.376 --> 11:51.178
or people connected
to Barksdale,

11:51.278 --> 11:53.646
you look for those companies
in the city land records.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.615
- Huh?
- For example,

11:55.715 --> 11:58.986
McNulty said that
he heard that Barksdale

11:59.086 --> 12:01.688
owned an apartment building
up on Druid Park Lake.

12:01.789 --> 12:04.091
You look up all the blocks
on Reservoir Hill.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.693
See if there's anything
owned by D&B Enterprises

12:06.794 --> 12:10.397
or any other company
that Prez finds through
corporate charter

12:10.497 --> 12:11.899
or anything similar.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.633
If you find something
that fits,

12:13.733 --> 12:15.335
you write down
the folio number

12:15.435 --> 12:18.138
so that you can look it up
later at the courthouse.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.073
You don't
find anything,

12:20.173 --> 12:22.075
just take the names of
all the corporate listings

12:22.175 --> 12:23.911
for the multi-units
near the lake.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.146
You call that list
over to Prez,

12:26.246 --> 12:28.115
who pulls
the charter papers

12:28.215 --> 12:29.883
and he'll look
for connections.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.219
This is like
a scavenger hunt.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.954
Yeah, but what if
Barksdale is careful?

12:34.054 --> 12:36.223
I mean, what if we can't
find his name on anything?

12:36.323 --> 12:37.791
In this country,

12:37.891 --> 12:41.061
somebody's name has got
to be on a piece of paper.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.963
A cousin, a girlfriend,
a grandmother,

12:43.063 --> 12:44.564
a lieutenant
he can trust,

12:44.664 --> 12:46.133
somebody's name is
on a piece of paper.

12:46.233 --> 12:50.670
And here's the rub,
you follow drugs,

12:50.770 --> 12:53.874
you get drug addicts
and drug dealers.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.343
But you start
to follow the money,

12:56.443 --> 12:59.312
and you don't know where
the fuck it's gonna take you.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.448
While we're running
around on this,

13:01.548 --> 13:03.984
what are you gonna do?

13:05.986 --> 13:08.922
- You need something?
- Yeah.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.991
Let me get the...

13:11.091 --> 13:14.127
campaign financial reports
for the western districts,

13:14.227 --> 13:16.296
and actually,
any citywide race.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.366
You want quarterly reports
or individual donor lists?

13:19.466 --> 13:20.633
Both, please.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.936
It'll be a couple
hundred pages.

13:23.036 --> 13:26.339
Really?
I'll take all of it.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.843
( siren blares )

13:32.745 --> 13:34.281
What the fuck, man?

13:37.750 --> 13:39.953
Driver,
with your right hand,

13:40.053 --> 13:41.889
reach through the window
and open the door.

13:41.989 --> 13:45.525
- Herc: C'mon, hurry up, man.
- Step out of the car.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.928
Drop the cane.
Toss the cane.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.497
Come around
to the back.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.366
All right.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.435
Turn around.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.238
Sir, is there
anything in the vehicle
we should know about?

13:58.338 --> 13:59.706
Nope.

13:59.806 --> 14:02.943
No guns, no drugs?

14:07.047 --> 14:09.016
We ain't got shit.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.092
This money right here,

14:19.192 --> 14:20.928
I didn't just pull this
out of your truck?

14:21.028 --> 14:23.196
What money?

14:24.564 --> 14:26.766
Damn, we'll be counting
this limp dick cash all day.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.868
Where you guys
going with all this?

14:28.969 --> 14:31.671
Like the man said,
it ain't ours.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.506
It ain't yours, huh?

14:33.606 --> 14:35.708
So, you don't mind if we just
take it off your hands?

14:35.808 --> 14:37.144
Do what you feel.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.778
You pretending to take
money up out this truck

14:38.878 --> 14:40.180
I didn't even know
was there.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.115
You know, I know
how that shit is.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.452
The other day,
I took up the sofa
cushions off my couch.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.155
Found a buck 40
I didn't even
know was there.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.061
Y'all ain't
got no charge, right?

14:57.830 --> 15:00.000
No, fucko, we do not
have a charge.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.969
We just
got your money.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.270
You want it back,
you can explain it

15:03.370 --> 15:05.939
to the state's attorney
where you got it.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.513
Y'all enjoy
your day now, you hear?

15:13.613 --> 15:16.016
( man rapping )
* As I wake up in the morning
and get out of my bed... *

15:16.116 --> 15:18.285
Man:
Yo, give me three.

15:18.385 --> 15:21.654
* The brothers I deal with
locked up... *

15:50.650 --> 15:53.253
* As I wake up in the morning
and get out of my bed *

15:53.353 --> 15:56.156
* I'm thinkin' about the people
I grew up with long dead *

15:56.256 --> 15:58.591
* The brothers I grew up
with locked up *

15:58.691 --> 16:00.427
* I'm freestylin'
off the top of my head *

16:00.527 --> 16:03.330
* You know, it's swell,
Patti LaBelle, I like her *

16:03.430 --> 16:05.598
* But Regina Bell
is better. *

16:19.579 --> 16:21.748
Motherfucker!

16:28.621 --> 16:31.924
Yo, motherfucker,
tryin' to steal our shit.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.327
( grunting )

16:41.034 --> 16:43.036
Motherfucker!

16:44.771 --> 16:47.374
Fished your wish, Bubs?

16:47.474 --> 16:48.908
Oh, yeah.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.045
And you should've seen
the one that got away.

16:58.118 --> 17:01.354
I nearly got killed
behind this caper, you know?

17:06.226 --> 17:09.061
It's all
in the game, Bubs.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.065
Oh, yeah?

17:43.530 --> 17:46.199
Yo, Bub...

17:46.299 --> 17:48.768
this ain't shit.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.240
I'm not high neither.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.543
It's fuckin'
Arm & Hammer.

17:56.643 --> 18:00.180
We just been
firin' baking soda.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.349
- Fuck.
- It's all right, man.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.484
I'll just come up
with another plan.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.753
- I did it once, right?
- Just...

18:29.909 --> 18:32.179
Fuck me.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.759
Carv. You go
to a restaurant

18:46.859 --> 18:50.230
and say the waitress
gives you good,
decent service.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.731
How much do you tip?

18:51.831 --> 18:54.367
How much do I tip?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.105
For good service.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.040
I don't know, 15%.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.909
Some people tip 20.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.011
Some people
got money.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.914
What you think
Wee-Bey would tip?

19:08.014 --> 19:09.816
You'd be
a clever motherfucker

19:09.916 --> 19:11.884
if there wasn't
a wiretap running.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.187
What do you mean?

19:21.461 --> 19:24.331
Say we turn in 20
and this afternoon

19:24.431 --> 19:25.698
the bosses are listening
to the wiretap

19:25.798 --> 19:28.801
and they hear we took
30 out of that car.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.973
Didn't think of that,
did you?

19:34.073 --> 19:36.909
We're finding a lot of stuff
on the Westside of downtown

19:37.009 --> 19:40.780
that might be his over by
that Howard Street corridor.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.916
- What kind of property?
- Low-rent commercials.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.151
A lot of vacants.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.586
The fuck does
Avon Barksdale want

19:46.686 --> 19:48.655
with a string of
empty storefronts?

19:48.755 --> 19:51.791
- This feels premature.
- What does?

19:51.891 --> 19:53.526
Chasing up assets.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.094
We're not close to putting
a charge to the man.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.363
That should
be the priority.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.830
We put a charge
to Avon Barksdale,

19:57.930 --> 20:00.433
the deputy shuts us down,
tells us to go home.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.901
You want the moneyside
of this case,

20:02.001 --> 20:03.870
it's now or never,
Lieutenant.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.538
Whoop-whoop!

20:07.540 --> 20:08.875
- Hey, I'm working here.
- Whoop-whoop!

20:08.975 --> 20:13.813
- Herc: Maybe 20 or 30.
- Dollars for donuts.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.749
You should've seen
the looks on their faces.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.085
- What did Wee-Bey say?
- "What money?"

20:19.185 --> 20:22.322
The only hassle is
we need to sit here
and count this shit.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.291
Do the ECU
submissions.

20:24.391 --> 20:27.159
And it's all limp-dick,
dime-vial money.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.629
Dirty bills
right off the corner.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.398
McNulty:
You all got the pit boys
on a fresh pay phone, right?

20:31.498 --> 20:33.800
- Yeah, on McCulloh.
- You take pictures?

20:33.900 --> 20:36.002
- Fuck, yeah.
- Good, we're gonna need
an additional affidavit

20:36.102 --> 20:37.203
to get up on that phone.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.706
Another 30 days, McNulty?

20:43.276 --> 20:45.512
- ( door slams )
- What the fuck did I do?

20:45.612 --> 20:48.147
One day he fights,
the next day he's ready
to roll over.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.682
Does he want this
fucking case or not?

20:49.782 --> 20:51.918
Freamon: Give him
some slack, Jimmy.

20:52.018 --> 20:56.255
He's wrestling with
the angels on this one.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.057
Where's my lucky pen?

20:58.157 --> 21:01.528
( music playing )

21:31.023 --> 21:33.292
- Man: You ready, bitch?
- Woman: Yeah, I'm ready.

21:33.393 --> 21:36.763
I wanna get on
my hands and suck you
like a great big lollipop.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.230
Oh, yeah, suck it.

21:38.331 --> 21:40.099
Yeah, I know
that's your favorite.

21:40.199 --> 21:44.003
Let me lick that.
You like that?

21:44.103 --> 21:46.839
I want you
to butt-fuck me.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.241
Prez:
You know, we're supposed
to turn off the tap

21:49.342 --> 21:50.710
when it's non-pertinent.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.579
Hey, fuck, no,
this is too good.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.847
- Man: Fuck me.
- Woman: Oh, daddy, yeah.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.383
You comin'?

21:56.483 --> 21:58.385
There's no way
I'm transcribin'
this stuff.

21:58.485 --> 22:01.253
Touch yourself.

22:01.354 --> 22:03.823
Oh, yeah.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.858
Phone sex?

22:05.958 --> 22:07.660
Shit was hilarious.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.562
You know you're supposed
to shut down

22:09.662 --> 22:11.163
after 90 seconds
if it's non-pertinent.

22:11.263 --> 22:14.233
You gonna look
like a glazed donut,
you know that?

22:14.333 --> 22:15.968
Is that right?

22:16.068 --> 22:19.038
I'm gonna get there
and fuck you in all
three holes.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.776
So, you're gonna come
past here?

22:23.876 --> 22:26.679
Tomorrow, yeah.
But I need to go past
Argyle Street tonight.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.815
- Check in with Wallace.
- Wallace?

22:28.915 --> 22:32.419
He off the hook since
we helped the tower crew
get that stickup boy.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.521
I'm tellin' you,
Wallace is buggin'.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.989
Don't hardly even come
out of that room no more.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.425
Why he be like that?

22:38.525 --> 22:40.226
I think he might
be gettin' high.

22:40.326 --> 22:41.528
Wallace?

22:41.628 --> 22:42.895
Boy scarin' me
with his shit.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.464
A'ight, well,
you holler at me later.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.132
That'll work.

22:46.232 --> 22:48.300
Pertinent now, right?

22:48.401 --> 22:50.470
Well, it is if you
can explain why we're
still on the line

22:50.570 --> 22:52.271
after 10 minutes
jerking off.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.907
You gotta
justify that.

22:55.007 --> 22:58.645
Maybe three holes
was the code for
three stash houses.

23:00.547 --> 23:03.650
( laughing )

23:03.750 --> 23:06.352
Omar.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.320
Hey, yo.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.757
Omar!
Omar, comin', yo.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.324
Omar's comin'.

23:12.425 --> 23:14.326
Did you hear me?
I said Omar comin'.

23:14.427 --> 23:16.463
Get outta here.
Omar's comin'.

23:16.563 --> 23:19.466
I said Omar's comin'!

23:19.566 --> 23:21.768
Somebody in trouble now.
Come on, let's go.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.703
Hey, yo.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.448
Hey, yo.

23:40.453 --> 23:43.189
Hey, yo!

23:46.425 --> 23:48.027
Y'all need to open
this door, man,

23:48.127 --> 23:50.963
before I huff and puff.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.666
C'mon, now, by the hairs
of your chinny-chin-chin.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.803
Terrell:
Omar, you best roll out.
We up in here with a Mac-10.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.506
I thinks not, Terrell.
I thinks not.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.307
Y'all might need
to think this through

24:01.407 --> 24:03.743
and stop
wasting my time.

24:03.843 --> 24:06.178
'Cause Omar
can come back tomorrow.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.748
And the next day.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.984
And the next day.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.786
And I will put a bullet
in all y'all behind

24:13.886 --> 24:16.856
what happen right now,
you heard?

24:36.242 --> 24:38.077
Fair enough.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.948
( dog barking )

24:43.415 --> 24:44.651
Here you go,
keep it.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.586
How do you wanna
play it?

24:46.686 --> 24:49.455
Hard and tight,
like she's got no choice.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.457
Greggs:
Shardene Ennis.

24:51.558 --> 24:52.959
Miss,
we need to talk.

24:53.059 --> 24:55.562
- About what?
- It's a downtown talk.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.297
This way.
C'mon, c'mon.

24:58.397 --> 25:01.133
( music playing )

25:02.434 --> 25:04.971
Wallace:
Gimme two and two.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.442
Man:
It's the bomb.
It's the bomb.

25:10.543 --> 25:12.612
Better get it
while it lasts.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.023
Yo, what's up?

25:24.123 --> 25:25.291
What you got?

25:25.391 --> 25:27.326
Family affair,
two-for-one, you up?

25:27.426 --> 25:29.261
Naw, not me.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.230
A'ight.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.674
How you figure
these little pebbles

25:41.774 --> 25:44.210
get up on top
of the roof?

25:45.344 --> 25:47.479
Where's everybody at?

25:47.580 --> 25:51.117
Maybe the whole thing
is over and no one
bothered to tell us.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.285
Maybe we won.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.492
Something ain't right.

26:00.593 --> 26:02.795
C'mon, let's take a ride.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.001
I like these.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.502
Yeah?

26:10.603 --> 26:12.471
The toy furniture
is great.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.941
Doll house
miniatures.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.776
It's a hobby.

26:16.876 --> 26:19.679
My sister had a dollhouse
when we were young.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.448
But nothing as nice
as these. Can I?

26:22.548 --> 26:25.618
Sure.

26:25.718 --> 26:29.288
That's a walnut
marble-top vanity.

26:30.857 --> 26:34.761
Renaissance revival,
late 19th century.

26:34.861 --> 26:37.864
Do you have
a house for 'em?

26:37.964 --> 26:38.965
No.

26:39.065 --> 26:41.600
I just make them
and sell them.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.535
That seems kinda sad.

26:43.636 --> 26:46.138
You should
have a house for them.

26:52.779 --> 26:55.682
We can use
the lieutenant's office.

26:58.985 --> 27:02.922
( children chattering )

27:13.565 --> 27:15.668
( doorbell rings )

27:17.269 --> 27:18.604
No.

27:18.705 --> 27:21.708
I ain't, I ain't
even asked for nothin'.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.411
Oh, what's up, Tosha?

27:25.511 --> 27:27.246
You got too pretty, girl.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.215
Go inside, Tosh.

27:36.555 --> 27:38.424
I'm thinkin', um--

27:38.524 --> 27:40.459
I'm thinkin'
about gettin' clean...

27:40.559 --> 27:42.394
again.

27:45.431 --> 27:46.766
I'm thinkin', you know,

27:46.866 --> 27:48.701
I ain't got no other place
to go, maybe...

27:48.801 --> 27:51.503
that's wrong, right?

27:51.603 --> 27:55.074
That ain't right,
right? Sorry.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.276
I'm sorry.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.881
Wait.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.595
Back door only.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.464
There's an old sofa
in the basement

28:18.564 --> 28:21.000
and I'll throw you
down some blankets.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.535
You try to come
up those stairs,

28:23.635 --> 28:25.171
and I'm gonna call
the police on you.

28:25.271 --> 28:27.706
I swear I will.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.876
( thunder rumbling )

28:39.752 --> 28:42.922
West fucking Baltimore
is on vacation.

28:43.022 --> 28:46.158
No crews slinging
in the low-rises,
the towers.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.235
( cheering )

28:57.937 --> 29:00.206
What the fuck?

29:12.785 --> 29:14.486
Who's playing who?

29:14.586 --> 29:16.555
West against east.

29:16.655 --> 29:18.390
Baltimore?

29:18.490 --> 29:19.725
The projects, man.

29:19.826 --> 29:22.061
The braggin' rights
to the projects.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.765
The projects
got a ball team?

29:39.778 --> 29:41.780
How long you been
working at Orlando's?

29:41.881 --> 29:44.383
- Four or five months.
- You like it?

29:44.483 --> 29:45.651
Pays the rent.

29:45.751 --> 29:47.353
You must see a lot
there, I imagine.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.720
What do you mean?

29:48.821 --> 29:49.922
Well, there's a lot
of players there.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.958
A lot of game
being played.

29:52.058 --> 29:53.359
I don't know
nothin' about that.
I just work for tips.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.995
- Greggs: For tips?
- Tips, drinks.

29:56.095 --> 29:57.363
You know,
I'm just a B-girl.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.365
I don't mess with
nothing beyond that.

29:59.465 --> 30:02.334
Some of the girls in there,
they're into drugs and whatnot.

30:02.434 --> 30:05.037
Some of 'em turn tricks
in the rooms upstairs,

30:05.137 --> 30:08.207
but I mostly just
stay at the bar.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.176
You know, Miss Ennis,
it's a rare thing

30:10.276 --> 30:11.911
when we ask somebody
to come on downtown with us,

30:12.011 --> 30:13.846
and we don't
have a charge on them,

30:13.946 --> 30:15.714
we don't tell them
what we're gonna talk about,

30:15.814 --> 30:17.549
and they come along
without complaining.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.219
- That hardly ever happens.
- Rarely, if ever.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.454
I figure
you got your reasons.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.456
The crew
that runs Orlando's.

30:24.556 --> 30:27.093
They've dropped about a dozen
bodies over the last year.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.828
And they're running the drugs
in every housing project

30:29.929 --> 30:31.964
west of
the Martin Luther King.

30:32.064 --> 30:35.367
I don't know
anything about that.
I just work for tips.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.569
But now you do know, right?
'Cause we're telling you.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.039
You know a girl
named Keisha Michaels?

30:40.139 --> 30:42.308
She dances with me.

30:42.408 --> 30:46.212
- How's she doing?
- All right, I guess.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.948
Will you excuse us
a moment?

30:59.658 --> 31:00.859
So, what do you think?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.428
I think
she's a sweetheart.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.696
I think if we push
her hard, she'll tumble.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.865
You want to show her
the pictures?

31:06.966 --> 31:09.468
I want to do better
than that.

31:10.802 --> 31:12.538
( cheering )

31:22.414 --> 31:25.617
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

31:28.921 --> 31:30.589
C'mon, man,
play defense.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.191
- D up.
- Let's go!

31:32.291 --> 31:34.393
D up, B.

31:34.493 --> 31:35.894
Avon:
Who is he?

31:35.995 --> 31:37.629
That's Marcus Rivera
right there, man.

31:37.729 --> 31:41.200
He out of Lake Clifton.
That nigger played
in Italy and shit.

31:42.701 --> 31:45.404
Hey, yo, Slim.
What's up, man?

31:45.504 --> 31:47.573
You gotta go all
the way over to Europe
to get you a ringer?

31:47.673 --> 31:49.541
Naw, he home now.

31:49.641 --> 31:52.644
But I see you pullin' boys
out the junior colleges.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.580
He from Eastside,
went to Dunbar.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.048
Hey, yo,
what's up, playboy?

31:56.148 --> 31:57.483
How come you wearin'
that suit, B?

31:57.583 --> 31:59.218
For real, it's 85
fucking degrees out here

31:59.318 --> 32:00.852
and you trying to be
like Pat Riley.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.821
Man, look the part,
be the part, motherfucker.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.357
Nigger, please.
You walkin' around with
a fake fucking clipboard.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.759
You can't even
read a playbook.
Be for real.

32:07.859 --> 32:09.928
You bunch of bitches.

32:16.902 --> 32:18.870
Yeah!

32:18.971 --> 32:20.306
Let's go.

32:20.406 --> 32:21.607
That was nice.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.709
That boy was talkin'
to God, right?

32:29.015 --> 32:32.351
- Ain't y'all
on the clock?
- Ain't you?

32:32.451 --> 32:35.187
- We on break.
- Then we on a break, too.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.956
What's up
with this game?

32:38.057 --> 32:39.658
Naw, just something we do
every year, you know?

32:39.758 --> 32:41.660
Eastside versus
Westside niggers.

32:41.760 --> 32:42.961
Loser gotta throw
a big-ass party

32:43.062 --> 32:44.796
up at Droodle Hill
next weekend.

32:44.896 --> 32:46.032
Who's favored?

32:46.132 --> 32:48.234
Eastside won
the last two years.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.436
My boys.

32:50.536 --> 32:52.304
Coroner:
Found nude Monday morning

32:52.404 --> 32:55.107
in a Dumpster
off Reisterstown Road,
above Northern.

32:55.207 --> 32:58.544
Toxicology is positive
for heroin and cocaine.

33:02.114 --> 33:05.384
- In a Dumpster?
- Freamon: Rolled up in a rug.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.919
She overdosed and whoever
was with her didn't do shit,

33:08.020 --> 33:09.688
but roll her up
and throw her away.

33:09.788 --> 33:11.590
'Cause that's
how they do.

33:11.690 --> 33:14.326
Coroner:
Positive for semen in vaginal,
anal, and oral cavities.

33:14.426 --> 33:17.163
Three different blood types,
all secreters.

33:17.263 --> 33:19.465
They fucked her
and threw her away.

33:19.565 --> 33:22.501
The only reason
we knew who she was
or what she was about

33:22.601 --> 33:24.603
or what she might mean
to someone like you,

33:24.703 --> 33:27.139
is because we've been keeping
an eye on the people

33:27.239 --> 33:29.908
who run Orlando's
for some time now.

33:30.008 --> 33:33.179
We got ways of knowing
what they're saying,
what they're thinking.

33:33.279 --> 33:35.047
You know what they said
about this one?

33:35.147 --> 33:36.515
Greggs:
That the stupid bitch
didn't know how good

33:36.615 --> 33:38.317
the snort was
at Little Man's party.

33:38.417 --> 33:41.120
That it was her own fault.
That's how they do.

33:41.220 --> 33:43.122
They use people,
and when they throw
them away,

33:43.222 --> 33:45.591
they find a way
to say it ain't on them.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.493
Lying motherfucker.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.296
He said they took her
to a hospital.

34:02.608 --> 34:04.343
Hell, yeah.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.912
That's what
I'm talkin' about.
Now, get back on D.

34:07.012 --> 34:09.181
Check out Avon.
He freakin'.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.818
Shit, man, we gotta
win this one.

34:12.918 --> 34:15.254
Yo, I think
Avon's here.

34:15.353 --> 34:16.922
Where?

34:17.022 --> 34:18.924
Like I know
what he looks like?

34:19.024 --> 34:21.159
He's a black guy
rooting for Westside.

34:27.933 --> 34:29.935
( phone rings )

34:30.034 --> 34:31.837
We might have
a visual on Avon.

34:31.937 --> 34:34.139
Street ball game
up at Cloverdale.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.873
Where's Greggs
and Freamon?

34:35.974 --> 34:38.377
Pressin' the stripper
they picked up.

34:39.945 --> 34:42.813
You and Carver
stay on the radio.

34:44.550 --> 34:47.553
- We should follow him.
- Why?

34:47.652 --> 34:49.588
He ain't gonna
touch drugs or money

34:49.688 --> 34:51.889
anywhere you can see him,
Lieutenant.

34:51.989 --> 34:54.592
In Narcotics
we follow guys.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.663
We do it well,
we make cases on it.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.871
Mount up.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.743
We've been on this guy
three months.

35:11.843 --> 35:13.912
Don't you even want
to get a look at him?

35:14.012 --> 35:15.981
Wouldn't know
Avon Barksdale

35:16.081 --> 35:17.416
if I fell over him
in the street.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.251
The thing is,
I don't need to.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.820
We get him by voice alone
or we don't get him.

35:25.224 --> 35:27.459
Yeah, baby!

35:28.760 --> 35:30.562
( blows whistle )

35:30.662 --> 35:32.764
Half-time.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.933
Got yourself
a fine ringer.

35:35.033 --> 35:36.835
Well, yeah, baby,
it's not your year,

35:36.935 --> 35:38.270
you know what
I'm talkin' about?

35:38.370 --> 35:39.771
It look that way,
but you never know.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.173
Oh, I know, man,
we up 12.

35:41.273 --> 35:43.442
Yeah, you is,
but, hey...

35:43.542 --> 35:45.577
I got a proposition
for you.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.546
Okay.

35:47.646 --> 35:48.680
Double down?

35:48.780 --> 35:50.982
Let's give this wager
a clean six-figures.

35:51.082 --> 35:53.285
You serious?

35:53.385 --> 35:55.020
I don't give a fuck, baby,
it's your money.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.422
You can waste it
if you want,

35:56.522 --> 35:58.457
you know
what I'm talkin' about?

36:04.996 --> 36:06.365
Daniels:
Anyone got him?

36:06.465 --> 36:08.267
( radio chatter )

36:08.367 --> 36:10.302
12-10.
12-10.

36:11.237 --> 36:14.673
- 12-10.
- You have him?

36:14.773 --> 36:18.277
Lieutenant, I don't even
know what I'm looking for.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.425
Whoo!

36:35.961 --> 36:37.963
( whistle blows )

36:39.865 --> 36:41.567
Foul.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.497
Got him marked.
On the sideline,
red shirt, white visor.

37:11.597 --> 37:14.032
I think he's coaching
or somethin'.

37:14.132 --> 37:16.835
Who this
fucking midget, yo?

37:30.081 --> 37:32.651
Get that midget
outta here, B.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.330
Hey.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.267
Man:
Why you holler at me?

37:49.368 --> 37:50.502
Man #2:
Yo, man, we gettin'
down to it.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.037
I get to you
when I get to you.

37:52.137 --> 37:54.940
That's it,
we're on the stash.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.944
- We are?
- Uh-huh.

38:06.151 --> 38:07.653
How can you
put that down

38:07.753 --> 38:09.254
when Sydnor
wasn't on the roof?

38:09.355 --> 38:11.089
Yes, he was.

38:11.189 --> 38:13.759
No, he's not.
He's with Daniels.

38:13.859 --> 38:16.428
No, he isn't.

38:33.211 --> 38:34.813
Get the fuck
outta here.

38:34.913 --> 38:37.516
Yo, yo, ref, ref, ref,
what the fuck?

38:39.418 --> 38:41.953
( blows whistle )

38:50.362 --> 38:52.030
What the fuck?

38:54.600 --> 38:57.102
Yo, ref, yo, ref,
what the fuck?

38:57.202 --> 38:58.870
The boy was fouled.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.539
Clear, straight up!

39:00.639 --> 39:02.941
How you gonna
not call that?

39:04.910 --> 39:06.612
Look, if you want,

39:06.712 --> 39:08.346
I can put time back
on the clock and replay it.

39:08.447 --> 39:09.848
You talkin' about
a do-over, baby?

39:09.948 --> 39:11.683
Are you talkin' about
a fuckin' do-over?

39:11.783 --> 39:13.585
That's not how
the game is played!

39:13.685 --> 39:15.253
You can't do that!
Fuckin' believe
this shit?

39:15.353 --> 39:17.222
Nigger talkin' about
doing it again.

39:17.322 --> 39:18.690
Look, I don't want
any trouble, okay?

39:18.790 --> 39:20.926
Ain't gonna be no trouble
over no ball.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.862
Man, you supposed
to be the ref, right?

39:23.962 --> 39:26.264
Why don't you stand up
for your fucking self?

39:26.364 --> 39:27.633
You pussy.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.801
You can't just let any
old motherfucking nigga

39:29.901 --> 39:32.804
get in your face,
you understand?

39:34.072 --> 39:35.774
Now, walk away.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.308
Walk away.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.310
Turn around
and walk the fuck away.

39:39.411 --> 39:42.380
Ignorant motherfucker.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.051
- We cool?
- Yeah, we cool, baby.

39:46.151 --> 39:49.020
You tell your people
to come out here to
the park Saturday at noon.

39:49.120 --> 39:52.591
'Course you come
on the Westside again,
baby, without a ball,

39:52.691 --> 39:54.493
I'm gonna
light your ass up.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.331
D'Angelo, huh?

40:00.432 --> 40:02.768
You know him?

40:02.868 --> 40:04.870
At this point,
it feels like I do.

40:09.641 --> 40:12.578
We sorta
moved in together.

40:14.212 --> 40:16.448
He seemed like
he was different.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.451
I have
to quit the club.

40:19.551 --> 40:22.253
Yes, you do.
But not just yet.

40:22.353 --> 40:24.222
We need your help.

40:24.322 --> 40:25.691
Which is why
we came to you.

40:25.791 --> 40:27.092
I don't know
what else you--

40:27.192 --> 40:28.727
Keisha was
not the first.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.829
Unless somebody steps up
a little bit,

40:30.929 --> 40:33.532
she's not gonna
be the last neither.

40:38.036 --> 40:41.607
Do you like that one?

40:41.707 --> 40:43.742
Why don't you keep it?

40:48.179 --> 40:50.682
Thank you.

40:56.622 --> 40:59.057
He's getting into
a black Ford Excursion.

40:59.157 --> 41:00.859
Herc:
Copy that.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.561
Daniels:
He's pulling out,
north on Collington.

41:02.661 --> 41:05.931
( rap music playing )

41:15.707 --> 41:18.476
11-71.
You got the parallel
on the north,

41:18.577 --> 41:20.278
I got him on the south.

41:20.378 --> 41:23.815
11-71, I got him.
Looks like he's going
east on Oliver.

41:39.698 --> 41:42.233
He just parked.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.335
East of Oliver.

41:44.435 --> 41:46.972
12-10,
you keep the eyeball.

41:47.072 --> 41:49.975
11-71, take up
a position on Federal,

41:50.075 --> 41:51.843
west of Montford.

41:51.943 --> 41:54.145
I'm coming up
from the south.

41:56.548 --> 41:58.750
11-71, I copy that.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.920
He's just
sitting there.

42:24.075 --> 42:27.012
- He's doubling back.
- Copy.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.855
He's south
on Montford.

42:51.703 --> 42:53.371
He's at the light
at Preston and Milton

42:53.471 --> 42:55.040
and is south on Milton.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.253
Be advised that he didn't
make it to Chase.

43:08.353 --> 43:11.456
11-71,
what's your status?

43:11.556 --> 43:14.793
Herc:
He couldn't have
gone past us.

43:14.893 --> 43:17.863
Sydnor:
11-71, nothin'
on this side.

43:21.733 --> 43:23.869
Must have
went to ground.

43:29.074 --> 43:31.977
All right,
hold your positions.
I'll take a look.

43:36.547 --> 43:39.718
( rap music playing )

44:03.474 --> 44:04.976
He called again,
same pay phone.

44:05.076 --> 44:06.044
Same voice?

44:06.144 --> 44:07.713
The main stash house,
it's gotta be.

44:07.813 --> 44:09.014
The pattern fits.

44:09.114 --> 44:10.916
Who took the call
at the projects?

44:11.016 --> 44:11.917
Who knows?

44:12.017 --> 44:13.384
There was no one
on the roof.

44:13.484 --> 44:16.688
Sydnor was off with Daniels
chasing Avon in the street.

44:16.788 --> 44:18.824
We had a good day, too.

44:18.924 --> 44:21.459
Kima turned
one of the dancers
over at Avon's club.

44:21.559 --> 44:24.595
The one who's
fucking D'Angelo.

44:24.696 --> 44:27.165
( muffled TV playing )

44:47.252 --> 44:49.721
( laughs )

44:56.261 --> 44:58.930
This guy's good.
We threw everything
we had at him.

44:59.030 --> 45:00.631
Well, you know
what they say,

45:00.732 --> 45:02.067
stupid criminals
make stupid cops.

45:02.167 --> 45:04.803
I'm proud to be
chasing this guy.

45:04.903 --> 45:07.806
We got four front
companies so far,

45:07.906 --> 45:10.108
buying up
all kinds of shit.

45:10.208 --> 45:12.510
A club,
an apartment building,
the funeral home.

45:12.610 --> 45:14.913
And a whole lot
of real estate on
the Westside of downtown

45:15.013 --> 45:16.882
by that
Howard Street corridor.

45:16.982 --> 45:19.450
Shop fronts
and warehouses.

45:19.550 --> 45:20.852
Barksdale's name on it?

45:20.952 --> 45:23.822
Fronts, mostly.
Relatives, some.

45:23.922 --> 45:27.725
Mind if
I have a seat?

45:27.826 --> 45:29.427
The point is,
he's had the projects

45:29.527 --> 45:31.396
for more than a year now
and it's a money factory.

45:31.496 --> 45:34.966
We popped Wee-Bey coming out
the other day with $22,000,

45:35.066 --> 45:36.701
and the boys
talking on the wire

45:36.802 --> 45:38.269
were saying that it wasn't
that much of a loss.

45:38.369 --> 45:39.971
22?

45:40.071 --> 45:42.373
And that's just from one morning
from the towers and the pit.

45:42.473 --> 45:44.776
Add the avenue corners,
you're probably up near 30.

45:44.876 --> 45:47.445
Another take
for the evening...

45:47.545 --> 45:49.147
$60,000.

45:49.247 --> 45:50.782
A day?

45:50.882 --> 45:53.451
That's 20, 25 million
a year, conservatively.

45:53.551 --> 45:56.487
You take out 20%
for running expenses
and spillage

45:56.587 --> 46:00.491
and you are still clearing
a million dollars a month.

46:00.591 --> 46:02.160
So, where's it all go?

46:02.260 --> 46:03.895
He shows no flash.

46:03.995 --> 46:07.966
He's got no house,
no car in his name,

46:08.066 --> 46:10.301
no jewelry,
no clothes.

46:10.401 --> 46:13.671
Just front companies
and the property.

46:13.771 --> 46:17.475
And political
contributions.

46:17.575 --> 46:21.913
$75,000 in last month alone,
all from his front companies

46:22.013 --> 46:23.581
or their
listed officers.

46:23.681 --> 46:25.483
And that's just
at a quick glance.

46:25.583 --> 46:27.953
I'm just totaling up
the legal contributions.

46:28.053 --> 46:31.089
You've got the likes
of Damien Price,

46:31.189 --> 46:33.124
aide to a state senator,

46:33.224 --> 46:35.961
driving out $20,000 in cash
from the projects

46:36.061 --> 46:37.996
whenever he feels it.

46:38.096 --> 46:40.098
Now, I know you don't want
to hear this, Lieutenant,

46:40.198 --> 46:43.068
but the money is real
and it's everywhere.

46:43.168 --> 46:46.972
And more than the drugs,
it's the money that matters.

46:49.607 --> 46:52.510
I ain't fucked nobody else
if that's what you thinkin'.

46:54.846 --> 46:56.047
A'ight, I mean, fuck it.

46:56.147 --> 46:58.349
Fuck it,
if you wanna go, then go!

46:58.449 --> 47:01.286
But you could give me
a goddamn reason.

47:06.624 --> 47:08.626
What do I look
like to you?

47:08.726 --> 47:09.995
What you mean?

47:10.095 --> 47:12.530
What do I look
like to you?

47:12.630 --> 47:14.299
You look like a girl,
a woman.

47:14.399 --> 47:16.834
A beautiful woman.
You fine, what?

47:16.935 --> 47:20.338
I don't look like
trash to you?

47:20.438 --> 47:22.908
Baby, this ain't
about what you do.

47:23.008 --> 47:25.676
I don't look like something
you could roll up in a rug

47:25.776 --> 47:28.213
and throw in the trash?

47:34.886 --> 47:37.388
Shardene.

47:37.488 --> 47:39.324
Shardene!

47:39.424 --> 47:42.160
Shardene!

47:42.260 --> 47:43.929
Lieutenant,
you paged us?

47:44.029 --> 47:46.031
We were almost home.

47:46.131 --> 47:47.899
Sit.

47:57.175 --> 47:59.610
- Yeah?
- Checked my count
again, yo.

47:59.710 --> 48:02.981
- How bad?
- Not too bad, man.
Not too bad.

48:03.081 --> 48:05.816
We, um, we got hit
by a 22.

48:05.917 --> 48:08.186
- 22?
- That's all.

48:08.286 --> 48:10.288
A'ight.

48:20.131 --> 48:23.301
I got towers two,
three, five and six

48:23.401 --> 48:25.503
and another one
labeled "P" for the pit.

48:25.603 --> 48:27.105
Where's one and four?

48:27.205 --> 48:29.774
It's on the wire that
we took them for 22.

48:29.874 --> 48:31.542
You shitheads
turned in 15.

48:31.642 --> 48:34.279
- Where's the rest?
- Lieutenant, we ain't got--

48:34.379 --> 48:36.948
You have 'til
roll call tomorrow

48:37.048 --> 48:39.317
to crawl back to whatever
rock you hid it under.

48:39.417 --> 48:42.920
It comes back
and it goes to ECU.

48:43.021 --> 48:45.991
This doesn't happen.

48:46.091 --> 48:50.128
Not with me.
Not with my unit.

49:01.039 --> 49:03.708
I wouldn't steal
and not tell you about it.

49:25.230 --> 49:28.033
This some of
Avon's shit.

49:28.133 --> 49:31.302
You got Avon Barksdale chasin'
your ass all around town,

49:31.402 --> 49:34.072
and you still find time
to take his shit.

49:34.172 --> 49:36.907
- It's your shit now.
- What I want with that?

49:37.008 --> 49:39.010
What anybody want
with that, man.

49:39.110 --> 49:40.845
How much you askin'?

49:40.945 --> 49:42.447
Oh, we free.

49:42.547 --> 49:44.415
Free?

49:46.517 --> 49:49.487
I'm sayin', I got a little
proposition for you.

49:49.587 --> 49:53.158
Proposition is, you get
four G-packs for free

49:53.258 --> 49:56.427
and you give me some better
idea on how I can reach Avon.

49:56.527 --> 49:58.396
How to contact him?

49:58.496 --> 50:00.431
Y'all just had
a game, right?

50:00.531 --> 50:02.700
How you get ahold
of him to parlay?

50:02.800 --> 50:04.835
We talk now and then.

50:04.935 --> 50:07.004
I page his ass.

50:07.105 --> 50:10.675
Okay. Okay.

50:10.775 --> 50:12.910
That all you need?
A number?

50:13.010 --> 50:14.545
Oh, I'll make
do with it.

50:14.645 --> 50:17.248
And a code for
one of his peoples.

50:19.084 --> 50:21.386
What Wee-Bey use, 07?

50:22.853 --> 50:25.190
07.

50:27.725 --> 50:30.228
What makes you think
I just ain't gonna take
this shit off your hands

50:30.328 --> 50:32.330
and throw your ass
up outta here?

50:32.430 --> 50:34.099
C'mon, man,
Avon goes down,

50:34.199 --> 50:36.801
the projects be open
market again, right?

50:38.069 --> 50:40.538
Let me understand.

50:40.638 --> 50:43.908
Avon loses
a hundred large
to me on a bet,

50:44.008 --> 50:46.577
then you bring me
some of his shit

50:46.677 --> 50:50.448
so that I can put your
predatory self on his ass?

50:51.949 --> 50:54.252
Not his day, is it?

51:01.859 --> 51:04.129
Fuck.

51:13.371 --> 51:15.106
Fuck.

51:20.445 --> 51:22.680
( sighs )

51:31.055 --> 51:33.090
Fuck it.

51:35.360 --> 51:39.430
- Where was it?
- The wheel well.

51:39.530 --> 51:42.233
You remember
when the bag broke?

51:44.569 --> 51:46.504
Think Daniels
will believe it?

51:46.604 --> 51:49.174
Would you?

51:52.843 --> 51:54.745
You didn't
believe me.

51:55.946 --> 51:58.383
I'm sorry.

51:58.483 --> 52:00.785
Savino late, man.
I'm ready to make
this money-run,

52:00.885 --> 52:02.520
get the fuck
outta here.

52:02.620 --> 52:05.423
- You tired, huh?
- I'm tired, man, I'm hungry.

52:05.523 --> 52:07.292
Shit, me, too.
You want something
to eat from the diner?

52:07.392 --> 52:08.759
Yeah, you goin'
over there?

52:08.859 --> 52:11.095
Get a cheesesteak, man.
Oh, you hungry, too?

52:11.196 --> 52:12.697
Yeah, I could
do a burger.

52:12.797 --> 52:15.132
All right.
Let me get onions
on that, man.

52:15.233 --> 52:17.134
I got you.

52:18.869 --> 52:21.138
You organizin' it right?
You got my 50s with my 50s,

52:21.239 --> 52:23.107
and my 20s--
and my 100s with my 100s.

52:23.208 --> 52:25.310
The way you want it.

52:25.410 --> 52:27.111
All right, ladies,
goodnight.

52:27.212 --> 52:30.348
I see y'all tomorrow,
on time, ya hear?

52:54.138 --> 52:56.274
( dialing )

52:58.075 --> 52:59.610
Count this money, baby.

52:59.710 --> 53:02.980
( pager beeps )

53:03.080 --> 53:05.616
- What the fuck?
- Who's that?

53:05.716 --> 53:09.354
Wee-Bey swingin' me
an emergency call.
