00:57.625 --> 00:58.424
Hey, Marshall.

00:58.426 --> 01:01.560
How are the jars of
jellyfish jam coming?

01:01.562 --> 01:04.229
Coming along great, I...

01:04.231 --> 01:06.331
Uh, uh-oh.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.166
(Laughing)

01:07.168 --> 01:09.835
These'll be perfect for Wally
the Walrus' wonderful wingding!

01:09.837 --> 01:12.404
He's been my best
bosom buddy for years!

01:12.406 --> 01:15.207
Wally will love having
his first ever party!

01:15.209 --> 01:17.743
I couldn't have done it
without you pups.

01:17.745 --> 01:18.577
We love to help!

01:18.579 --> 01:21.413
Oh, here, have a few
of these tasty treats.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.581
Ew!
Bleh!

01:22.583 --> 01:24.183
I mean, no thanks.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.518
Wally really
likes his treats.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.921
Yeah, he should have them.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.489
BOTH:
All of them.

01:30.491 --> 01:31.223
(Laughing)

01:31.225 --> 01:34.193
Okay then, thanks again, pups.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.327

See ya later.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.212
Ryder here.

<i> Terribly torn about troubling</i>
<i> you, but something's gone</i>

01:55.883 --> 01:59.318
<i> seriously south with</i>
<i> Wally Appreciation Day!</i>

01:59.320 --> 02:00.219
What's the matter?

02:00.221 --> 02:01.787
<i> No Wally is the matter.</i>

02:01.789 --> 02:04.756
I put out a scrumptious
selection of seafood snacks,

02:04.758 --> 02:05.958
but Wally's a no show!

02:05.960 --> 02:08.861
I'm sure he's fine,
but we'll go find him.

02:08.863 --> 02:12.764

02:58.913 --> 03:00.379
Thanks for hurrying, pups.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.014
I just got a call
from Cap'n Turbot.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.683
Wally didn't show up
for his special party.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.885
TURBOT:
<i> Huh? Wally!</i>

03:06.887 --> 03:08.754
Why would Wally miss it?

03:08.756 --> 03:09.655
Good question.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.924
We need to make sure
Wally's okay.

03:11.926 --> 03:16.495
Zuma, I'll need you and your
scuba gear to search underwater.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.630
Let's dive in!

03:18.632 --> 03:20.632
Skye, I'll need you
and your copter

03:20.634 --> 03:23.468
to see if we can spot
Wally from the air.

03:23.470 --> 03:24.336
(Barking)

03:24.338 --> 03:25.771
Let's take to the sky!

03:25.773 --> 03:29.408
All right, PAW Patrol
is on a roll!

04:18.125 --> 04:20.626
Life jacket, deploy!

04:38.979 --> 04:41.580
Any sign of him yet,
Cap'n Turbot?

04:41.582 --> 04:44.883
No, I've patrolled the perimeter
for that precious pinniped,

04:44.885 --> 04:46.918
but haven't heard a peep!

04:46.920 --> 04:47.953
Huh?

04:47.955 --> 04:48.787
(Laughing)

04:48.789 --> 04:51.923
Cap'n Turbot means he looked
all over for Wally,

04:51.925 --> 04:53.558
but hasn't heard him
or seen him.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.794
Wally would never miss
an awesome party.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.563
He's not going to miss it
'cause we're gonna find him.

04:58.565 --> 05:01.700
Care for a cooked cod
cookie first?

05:01.702 --> 05:03.101
Lots of energy!

05:03.103 --> 05:03.902
No thanks.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.605
Wally will probably be pretty
hungry when he gets here.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.107
Oh yeah, he's always hungry.

05:09.109 --> 05:09.975
(Snapping)
Hey!

05:09.977 --> 05:12.778
Maybe these fishy treats
will help find him.

05:12.780 --> 05:13.712
Mind if we use some?

05:13.714 --> 05:15.914
Sure, anything
to bring Wally back.

05:15.916 --> 05:19.584
Skye, I'll hang some Wally
treats on your copter

05:19.586 --> 05:20.686
to lure him out.

05:20.688 --> 05:23.155
Sounds like a plan!

05:25.025 --> 05:28.193
This squid jerky is
spectacularly stinky!

05:28.195 --> 05:29.494
Ugh!

05:29.496 --> 05:30.495
Yuck!

05:30.497 --> 05:31.930
Pee-yew!

05:31.932 --> 05:34.733
I can smell it from up here!

05:38.138 --> 05:40.539
No Wally anywhere.

05:40.541 --> 05:44.176
Wait, I see
something in the water.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.610
(Sniffing)

05:45.612 --> 05:46.144
(Gagging)

05:46.146 --> 05:50.148
Not Wally, just
a very fussy whale.

05:51.585 --> 05:55.687
Ryder, there's a pile of empty
clamshells up past the lookout.

05:55.689 --> 05:59.825
I don't see Wally,
but maybe he's nearby.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.626
RYDER:
On our way!

06:01.628 --> 06:02.728
Empty clamshells?

06:02.730 --> 06:05.464
Wally's completely crazy
for cold clams!

06:05.466 --> 06:06.231
We'll go check it out.

06:06.233 --> 06:09.101
Probably should bring
some extra Wally bait.

06:09.103 --> 06:10.502
Totally on it!

06:10.504 --> 06:11.536
(Barking)

06:11.538 --> 06:13.004
Buoy!

06:14.141 --> 06:19.144
Wally's sure to be tempted by
this floating squid smorgasbord!

06:19.146 --> 06:21.680
(Squawking)

06:22.916 --> 06:24.850
They're eating all
of Wally's snacks!

06:24.852 --> 06:28.687
Come on, Zuma,
we can outrace them.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.256
Later, feathered dudes!

06:31.258 --> 06:34.159
(Squawking)

06:34.161 --> 06:36.128
Still one hitchhiker.

06:36.130 --> 06:37.629
(Squawking)

06:37.631 --> 06:39.931
(Laughing)

06:40.801 --> 06:43.668
(Squawking)

06:44.938 --> 06:45.871
Almost there, Skye.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.774
Just trying to shake
some squid-stealing gulls.

06:48.776 --> 06:49.608
(Squawking)

06:49.610 --> 06:51.176
You're not the only one.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.511
(Squawking)

06:52.513 --> 06:55.614
There's the pile of shells!

06:55.616 --> 06:58.183
(Squawking)

07:00.120 --> 07:00.852
Go home!

07:00.854 --> 07:02.988
Don't you miss the other
little gull dudes?

07:02.990 --> 07:05.657
Hang on, let me try.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.995
Shoo, shoo!

07:09.997 --> 07:10.962
Whoa, Ryder!

07:10.964 --> 07:12.931
You have the magic touch!

07:12.933 --> 07:14.900
Not me, him!

07:14.902 --> 07:18.170
(Walrus barking)

07:18.172 --> 07:18.937
Hey, Wally!

07:18.939 --> 07:20.939
Wally scared the gulls away!

07:20.941 --> 07:22.274
Good to see you, buddy!

07:22.276 --> 07:23.208
(Walrus barking)

07:23.210 --> 07:25.610
Cap'n Turbot, we found Wally!

07:25.612 --> 07:27.579
<i> My wandering walrus?</i>

07:27.581 --> 07:28.180
<i> Woo-hoo!</i>

07:28.182 --> 07:30.649
I bet you're hungry.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.852
Here you go!

07:33.854 --> 07:34.753
Huh?

07:34.755 --> 07:36.988
Whoa, I'm seeing double!

07:38.258 --> 07:39.791
Aww!

07:39.793 --> 07:41.860
Cap'n Turbot,
you won't believe this!

07:41.862 --> 07:45.130
Wally's sharing his treats
with his new walrus friend.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.632
<i> Wally has a walrus buddy?</i>

07:47.634 --> 07:49.768
Come on, you two!

07:49.770 --> 07:51.603
(Walrus barking)

07:51.605 --> 07:54.773
There's lots more goodies
where those came from!

07:55.876 --> 07:59.010
So this is where
Wally's been hiding.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.312
Wally and his new friend.

08:00.314 --> 08:03.014
CAP'N TURBOT:
There you are, wandering Wally!

08:03.016 --> 08:04.149
(Walrus barking)

08:04.151 --> 08:05.150
Oh, and your new friend!

08:05.152 --> 08:07.819
How's about we call you...
Walinda?

08:07.821 --> 08:10.021
(Walrus barking)
(Walrus barking)

08:10.023 --> 08:10.889
They like it!

08:10.891 --> 08:12.224
And they'd like more treats.

08:12.226 --> 08:16.795
Walrus Appreciation Day shall
start with some savory snacks!

08:22.069 --> 08:23.835
Look at Walinda chow down!

08:23.837 --> 08:24.669
But not Wally.

08:24.671 --> 08:28.740
Hmm, he normally goes gaga
over the gooey green goodies.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.676
Well, I'll be a walrus' uncle!

08:31.678 --> 08:35.013
That's why Wally's giving
Walinda all the good grub.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.915
Walinda's gonna have a baby!

08:36.917 --> 08:38.350
SKYE:
That's awesome!

08:38.352 --> 08:40.118
A baby walrus?

08:40.120 --> 08:41.820
Totally cool!

08:41.822 --> 08:43.255
That's why Wally went missing.

08:43.257 --> 08:44.789
He's been getting Walinda food.

08:44.791 --> 08:47.325
She needs to eat a lot
to get ready for her baby.

08:47.327 --> 08:50.729
Wally, are you psyched
to be a dad?

08:50.731 --> 08:52.297
(Walrus barking)

09:03.677 --> 09:05.310
(Buoy ringing)

09:05.312 --> 09:07.012
(Walrus barking)

09:07.014 --> 09:09.748
Why's Wally so bummed?

09:11.418 --> 09:12.684
(Walrus barking)

09:12.686 --> 09:16.855
Look how that buoy's moving,
like something's pulling it.

09:16.857 --> 09:17.689
Where's Walinda?

09:17.691 --> 09:20.959
Uh-oh, could she be tangled
in the buoy chain?

09:20.961 --> 09:21.760
Let's go, Zuma.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.763
If she's stuck,
we gotta get her loose.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.965
Okay, Wally.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.234
Take us to Walinda.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.703
(Barking)

09:51.825 --> 09:55.226
(Walrus barking, groaning)

09:59.066 --> 10:00.732
(Gasping)

10:02.336 --> 10:03.001
Yay!

10:03.003 --> 10:04.936
She was caught
in the buoy line.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.305
The struggle wiped her out.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.707
(Walrus barking)

10:08.709 --> 10:10.976
That was a walrus thank you.

10:10.978 --> 10:11.910
Just remember,

10:11.912 --> 10:14.946
whenever you're in trouble,
just bark for help.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.715
(All laughing)

10:16.717 --> 10:18.483
(Walrus barking)

10:18.485 --> 10:20.318
So, Captain,

10:20.320 --> 10:22.454
how are Wally
and Walinda doing?

10:22.456 --> 10:23.355
I wish I knew.

10:23.357 --> 10:27.759
I've been watching for those
walruses all week.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.794
Hello?

10:29.796 --> 10:32.397
Wally, where are you?

10:32.399 --> 10:34.232
(Walrus barking)

10:34.234 --> 10:35.200
It's about time!

10:35.202 --> 10:38.003
We sure are happy
to see you two.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.170
(Walrus barking)

10:39.172 --> 10:41.973
I mean, happy to see
you three!

10:41.975 --> 10:44.342
(Walrus barking)

10:47.280 --> 10:48.480
ALL:
Awww!

10:48.482 --> 10:52.517
That's the super-cutest
little baby walrus ever!

10:52.519 --> 10:55.053
Here you go.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.922
(Walrus barking)

10:57.924 --> 10:59.257
Wow, what a good pup.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.826
A whole bunch of good pups.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.062
(Pups howling)

11:05.032 --> 11:07.132
(Walrus barking)

11:10.270 --> 11:12.437
(Laughing)

11:15.175 --> 11:17.108
Uh-oh.

11:18.145 --> 11:18.843
Weird.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.845
These fish cookies
taste pretty good.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.881
Sure do.
That's not a fish cookie.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.216
All I had left
were dog biscuits.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.051
(Yipping)

11:26.053 --> 11:29.154
I'll try one of those.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.922
Ooh!

11:30.924 --> 11:32.924
(Barking)

11:32.926 --> 11:34.092
(Laughing)

11:34.094 --> 11:35.794
(Barking)

11:37.230 --> 11:38.029
(Laughing)

11:38.031 --> 11:40.432
Told you!
Totally tasty!

11:40.434 --> 11:44.169
Mmm-mm, that's some
marvelous munchies.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.971
(Pups laughing)

11:55.549 --> 11:57.882
(Barking and laughing)

11:57.884 --> 12:00.318
I got it!

12:03.190 --> 12:04.155
Yes!

12:04.157 --> 12:04.656
Goal!

12:04.658 --> 12:08.626
Woo-hoo! Yeah!
All right!

12:15.268 --> 12:16.000
Look, François!

12:16.002 --> 12:19.237
The femur for the fossilized
dinosaur skeleton we found!

12:19.239 --> 12:21.072
Zat is fantastique!

12:21.074 --> 12:23.541
We can speed things up
with this!

12:23.543 --> 12:27.412
I'm not sure that's
such a good idea.

12:33.487 --> 12:34.953
Whew!
Close one.

12:34.955 --> 12:38.123
I was worried the whole cliff
might give way.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.459
François, look out!

12:41.461 --> 12:43.394
Rockslide!

12:43.396 --> 12:45.930
(Screaming)

12:46.233 --> 12:50.602
The bad news is we're totally
trapped on this cliff,

12:50.604 --> 12:52.370
with no way up or down.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.005
What is ze good news?

12:54.007 --> 12:57.342
The rumbling rockslide
revealed the dino bone.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.544
If we can dig out
ze rest of ze bone,

12:59.546 --> 13:02.347
ze dinosaur skeleton
is complete!

13:02.349 --> 13:05.049
I told you
it would be faster.

13:05.051 --> 13:06.084
I'd better call Ryder.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.419
We need the PAW Patrol
to secure this seriously

13:08.421 --> 13:10.522
significant scientific
discovery.

13:10.524 --> 13:11.956
And get us off ze rock!

13:11.958 --> 13:13.525
And make sure
the bone is safe.

13:13.527 --> 13:16.261
And get us off ze rock!

13:19.399 --> 13:22.467
(Barking)

13:23.003 --> 13:25.537
I'm open! I'm open!

13:26.740 --> 13:29.007
Go, pups! You can do it!

13:29.009 --> 13:30.642
(Phone ringing)

13:30.644 --> 13:32.443
Hi, Cap'n Turbot.

13:32.445 --> 13:36.447
<i> Ryder! We found a big bone!</i>

13:36.449 --> 13:38.449
FRANÇOIS:
<i> And the cliff, she fell!</i>

13:38.451 --> 13:40.351
<i>We can finish the skeleton!</i>

13:40.353 --> 13:42.287
<i> But we are stuck!</i>

13:42.289 --> 13:42.987
Hold on.

13:42.989 --> 13:47.258
You found a giant dinosaur bone
and you're stuck on a cliff?

13:47.260 --> 13:48.459
BOTH:
<i> Exactly.</i>

13:48.461 --> 13:50.695
We'll be right there.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.699
PAW Patrol,
to the lookout!

13:54.701 --> 13:56.568
ALL:
Ryder needs us!

13:56.570 --> 13:59.137
One last kick!

14:01.441 --> 14:02.440
Whoa!

14:02.442 --> 14:03.708
(Barking)

14:03.710 --> 14:05.176
Where's Marshall?

14:05.178 --> 14:10.048
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:14.721 --> 14:16.487
Timber!

14:16.489 --> 14:18.790
(Groaning)

14:34.574 --> 14:38.776
PAW Patrol, ready for action,
Ryder, sir!

14:38.778 --> 14:40.812
Thanks for racing over, pups.

14:40.814 --> 14:42.113
We've got double trouble.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.682
Cap'n Turbot and François
were in the middle

14:44.684 --> 14:46.351
of uncovering this!

14:46.353 --> 14:51.422
That's the biggest puppy snack
bone I've ever seen!

14:51.424 --> 14:53.758
Uh, that's a dinosaur bone.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.427
A dinosaur? Cool!

14:56.429 --> 14:59.264
Are there any still around?

14:59.266 --> 15:00.064
Nope!

15:00.066 --> 15:01.666
They're all extinct, Zuma.

15:01.668 --> 15:02.533
(Chuckling)

15:02.535 --> 15:05.737
When I'm "exstink,"
Ryder just gives me a bath.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.705
(Laughing)

15:07.707 --> 15:10.441
The bone is the last one
Cap'n Turbot needs

15:10.443 --> 15:12.410
to complete the T.rex skeleton.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.145
What's the other problem, Ryder?

15:14.147 --> 15:17.682
They're stranded. Most of the
cliff's fallen away.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.617
<i> (Screaming)</i>

15:19.853 --> 15:21.619
Marshall, I need
you and your ladder

15:21.621 --> 15:24.789
to get Cap'n Turbot
and François to safety.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.791
I'm fired up!

15:27.260 --> 15:28.860
Rubble, I need you
and your crane

15:28.862 --> 15:31.562
to help get that bone
down safely.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.232
Rubble on the double!

15:34.234 --> 15:34.832
All right!

15:34.834 --> 15:36.868
PAW Patrol is on a roll!

15:36.870 --> 15:39.470
(Barking excitedly)

15:41.274 --> 15:42.674
¶ PAW Patrol ¶

15:42.676 --> 15:46.110
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:46.112 --> 15:46.844

15:46.846 --> 15:48.112
¶ Go, go, go, go! ¶

15:48.114 --> 15:51.683
Yeah!
(Barking)

15:51.685 --> 15:58.823

15:58.825 --> 16:00.191

16:15.308 --> 16:17.375

16:17.377 --> 16:19.911
¶ PAW Patrol, PAW Patrol ¶

16:19.913 --> 16:23.414
(Tires screeching)

16:43.370 --> 16:46.604
FRANÇOIS:
Can you see zem yet?

16:46.606 --> 16:47.839
Not yet.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.540
(Sighing)

16:51.745 --> 16:52.777
Huh?

16:52.779 --> 16:55.413
Hit the brakes, pups!

16:55.415 --> 16:59.183
These must be from the
rockslide.

17:01.354 --> 17:05.823
I see the Cap'n and François
and the bone.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.826
I see zem!
I mean them.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.629
But there's a lot of
loose rocks in the way.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.531
What will we do?

17:13.533 --> 17:14.732
We need this road clear.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.300
Think you can help us out,
Rubble?

17:16.302 --> 17:19.370
What this road needs
is a little TLR.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.973
Tender Loving Rubble.

17:21.975 --> 17:24.642
(Laughing)

17:24.644 --> 17:27.612
Arf! Crane!

17:35.522 --> 17:38.356
Come on, come to Rubble.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.857
Make a pile over there.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.427
Roger, Ryder!

17:50.370 --> 17:51.402
Last one.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.870
Great work, Rubble.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.972
Now we can get on
with the rescue.

17:54.974 --> 17:57.742
They did it!
They cleared the rocks!

17:57.744 --> 17:59.911
(Cheering)

17:59.913 --> 18:01.913
(Rumbling)

18:03.349 --> 18:04.782
(Cheering very quietly)

18:04.784 --> 18:07.852
Okay, pups.
Let's get those two down safely.

18:07.854 --> 18:11.756
Marshall, take your ladder up
and help them down.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.924
On it!

18:12.926 --> 18:14.926
Ladder!

18:19.532 --> 18:20.264
Uh-oh.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.632
My ladder's too short.

18:21.634 --> 18:26.270
Cap'n, can you reach Marshall's
ladder?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.673
Am I close, Marshall?

18:28.675 --> 18:30.775
Almost!

18:30.777 --> 18:33.344
I think I found it.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.846
Whoops!

18:34.848 --> 18:36.414
Ow! Ow!

18:36.416 --> 18:38.783
Sorry, Marshall!

18:39.919 --> 18:41.786
Yow!

18:42.722 --> 18:43.788
You okay, Marshall?

18:43.790 --> 18:48.459
I'm okay, but Cap'n Turbot
and François are still stuck.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.862
BOTH:
Help!

18:50.864 --> 18:53.531
Time for reinforcements.

18:53.533 --> 18:56.534
Skye, we need your harness!

18:56.536 --> 19:00.404
<i> This pup's gotta fly!</i>

19:02.442 --> 19:05.009
(Whimpering)

19:08.481 --> 19:10.781
Just tell me
when we are on ze ground.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.851
You're on the ground.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.052
Oh-- oh!

19:15.054 --> 19:17.388
Heh-heh, that wasn't so bad.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.923
(Laughing)

19:18.925 --> 19:20.057
You're next, Horatio!

19:20.059 --> 19:23.361
I'm going to stay up here
until the bone's dug out!

19:23.363 --> 19:24.762
Are you sure, Captain?

19:24.764 --> 19:26.430
It might not be safe.

19:26.432 --> 19:27.331
I'll be careful.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.366
If I can get this bone,

19:28.368 --> 19:31.469
Adventure Bay will have a
complete T.rex skeleton.

19:31.471 --> 19:34.005
Woo-hoo-hoo, yeah!

19:34.007 --> 19:35.373
Huh?

19:35.375 --> 19:36.474
Look out!

19:36.476 --> 19:37.608
Heh-heh-heh.
Sorry.

19:37.610 --> 19:42.547
Pups, let's get that bone
and Cap'n Turbot down safely.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.115
Skye, I need the harness!

19:44.117 --> 19:47.051
You got it, Ryder!

19:47.820 --> 19:50.688
Rubble, stand by with your crane
to lower the bone.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.957
I'll help Cap'n Turbot
dig it out.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.859
On the double, Ryder!

19:54.861 --> 19:57.828
Boy, would I like
to chew on that.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.030
(Stomach grumbling)

19:59.032 --> 20:00.932
(Laughing)

20:00.934 --> 20:03.901
All right, Skye.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.438
Oh, Ryder!

20:07.440 --> 20:10.875
A little closer, Skye.

20:10.877 --> 20:11.876
Careful, Ryder!

20:11.878 --> 20:16.080
Okay, Cap'n,
let's dig us out a bone.

20:19.485 --> 20:20.551
RYDER:
The bone is loose!

20:20.553 --> 20:23.921
Okay, Rubble,
get the crane into position.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.590
Right, Ryder!

20:25.592 --> 20:28.459
Here comes the crane!

20:28.461 --> 20:30.661
A little more.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.563
A little more...

20:32.565 --> 20:33.831
There! You got it!

20:33.833 --> 20:35.032
Woo-hoo!

20:35.034 --> 20:37.802
Rubble, pull!

20:38.638 --> 20:40.972
Whoa!

20:42.175 --> 20:43.407
Whoa, whoa!

20:43.409 --> 20:45.676
Hold tight, Ryder!

20:45.678 --> 20:46.944
Uh-oh.

20:46.946 --> 20:47.845
I got it.

20:47.847 --> 20:51.482
Nice and easy.

20:51.484 --> 20:54.118
Whew!

20:56.155 --> 21:00.157
The bone's not the only thing
that's loose!

21:00.159 --> 21:02.693
Oh, no!

21:02.695 --> 21:05.196
Um, Ryder?

21:05.198 --> 21:06.831
Help!

21:06.833 --> 21:08.933
Skye, I'll head down
with the bone.

21:08.935 --> 21:12.203
We'll use your harness to get
Cap'n Turbot down.

21:12.205 --> 21:14.538
Strap in, Cap'n.

21:16.209 --> 21:17.942
Whew.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.978
Whoa!

21:20.980 --> 21:23.514
(Gasping)

21:23.516 --> 21:25.716
(Cheering)

21:25.718 --> 21:27.118
BOTH:
You did it, guys!

21:27.120 --> 21:28.619
Great job, Skye.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.988
Thanks, Ryder.

21:33.493 --> 21:36.761
It's beautiful!

21:36.763 --> 21:38.496
Oh, Horatio!

21:38.498 --> 21:39.764
François!

21:39.766 --> 21:43.834
I have found the perfect
dinosaur bone!

21:43.836 --> 21:48.839
I will be the paleontologist
of the year!

21:48.841 --> 21:51.909
François...

21:51.911 --> 21:57.481
Ahem, I mean, we will the
paleontologists of the year.

21:58.051 --> 21:59.483
And the pups.

21:59.485 --> 22:02.019
(Laughing)

22:04.223 --> 22:06.657
MAYOR GOODWAY:
A perfect fit!

22:06.659 --> 22:11.662
I do hereby declare this
skeleton complete!

22:12.565 --> 22:14.031
(Cheering)

22:14.033 --> 22:16.734
Gee. For once
we aren't the only ones

22:16.736 --> 22:18.903
getting excited about a bone.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.538
(Laughing)

22:20.540 --> 22:23.074
I think he likes it here.

22:23.076 --> 22:24.241
How can you tell?

22:24.243 --> 22:26.077
MAYOR GOODWAY:
Look at that smile!

22:26.079 --> 22:29.280
I want a picture with the heroes
who found it!

22:29.282 --> 22:31.248
That's me, my cousin...

22:31.250 --> 22:33.651
Ryder and his PAW Patrol pups.

22:33.653 --> 22:36.854
That's right. You've all been
very good pups.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.724
Remember, if you're ever
in trouble,

22:39.726 --> 22:41.659
just roar for help.

22:41.661 --> 22:44.962
Okay, smile, everyone!

22:45.565 --> 22:48.099
Oh, look at that!
