18:05.502 --> 18:08.755
That's your plan? (SCOFFS)
She'll snipe us right off the bikes.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.260
THE MANDALORIAN: It's a flash charge.

18:13.427 --> 18:14.678
We alternate shots,

18:14.761 --> 18:16.430
it'll blind any scope temporarily.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.016
Combine that with our speed
and we got a chance.

18:19.558 --> 18:20.559
A chance?

20:44.828 --> 20:46.371
Why don't you go find your blaster?

20:51.084 --> 20:53.170
A Mandalorian.

20:53.670 --> 20:56.798
It's been a long time
since I've seen one of your kind.

20:58.550 --> 21:00.010
Ever been to Nevarro?

21:01.595 --> 21:03.555
I hear things didn't go so well there,

21:03.639 --> 21:06.391
but it looks like you got off easy.

21:09.895 --> 21:12.147
You don't have to worry
about gettin' to Nevarro,

21:12.231 --> 21:14.316
or anywhere else, once we turn you in.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.943
You know, I really should thank you.

Looks like one of us has to walk.

21:41.635 --> 21:44.096
All right, so what is the plan?

21:44.513 --> 21:46.765
THE MANDALORIAN:
I need you to go find that dewback we saw.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.519
And leave you here with my bounty
and my ride?

21:50.602 --> 21:51.895
Yeah, I don't think so, Mando.

Watch her,
and don't let her get near the bike.

Look, there's still time
to make my rendezvous in Mos Espa.

22:58.795 --> 23:02.216
Take me to it and I can pay you
double the price on my head.

23:02.716 --> 23:04.176
I don't care about the money.

23:04.635 --> 23:07.387

keeps all the money for himself.

I mean, it seems like
he's calling all the shots.

23:15.312 --> 23:17.731
I hired Mando, this is my job.

23:18.065 --> 23:21.193
Bringin' you in will make me a full member
of the Bounty Hunters Guild.

23:21.693 --> 23:24.321
You already have something
the Guild values far more than me.

23:24.404 --> 23:25.489
You just don't see it.

23:25.781 --> 23:28.158
-What?
-The Mandalorian.

23:28.909 --> 23:31.370
His armor alone's worth
more than my bounty.

23:32.079 --> 23:34.206
I already told you,
I don't care about the money.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.167
Then think what it would do
for your reputation.

23:39.336 --> 23:43.215
A Mandalorian
shot up the Guild on Nevarro,

23:43.298 --> 23:46.802
took some high value target
and went rogue.

23:49.096 --> 23:50.472
That Mandalorian?

23:50.556 --> 23:52.391
Like I said, you don't see many.

You bring the Guild that traitor,
and they'll welcome you with open arms.

Word is, he still has the target with him.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.210
Some say it's a child.

24:21.545 --> 24:26.925
Look, if you're afraid to take him on,
fear not. I can help you with that.

I'd be a dead man.

more than you are, well...
