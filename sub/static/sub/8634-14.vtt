-This is a waste of time.
-No, it is not, Slyth.

01:35.895 --> 01:41.100
Thundercats are close and the
can not say no to help.

01:41.201 --> 01:45.800
-What 'staying Tabbut then?
"He will, do not worry.

01:45.972 --> 01:48.972
Like any other Tabbuts,
so does he care only about money ...

01:49.175 --> 01:53.475
... and this is the day he collects
In the interest of Wollo and Bolkinerna.

01:53.646 --> 01:59.991
"He always takes this path.
-He will.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.999
I have his stock.
Take the saddle bags!

02:13.066 --> 02:17.969
It is heavy.
The collection went well today?

02:19.239 --> 02:24.800
Thieves! Robbers!
Help!

02:25.111 --> 02:29.700
-Higher!
-Help!

02:30.383 --> 02:34.500
Somebody, help!

02:34.821 --> 02:40.444
-Do you hear that, Cheetara?
-Heard? I'm halfway there.

02:41.928 --> 02:46.661
Thundercats. One of them anyway.
The woman, Cheetara.

02:47.233 --> 02:53.600
-Embark, Tabbut.
-No! My money!

02:53.806 --> 02:58.038
You still have your head.
Be grateful, fool.

02:58.211 --> 03:01.305
Go away!

03:01.481 --> 03:06.009
"She is almost here.
-Fast, Slyth, hide!

03:06.186 --> 03:09.747
A Thundercat to come. Tygr.

03:09.923 --> 03:16.351
Wait, Monkian.
We do both, yes ...?

03:19.199 --> 03:22.259
It came from here, I'm sure.

03:22.835 --> 03:27.272
-Did you see anything, Cheetara?
-Not anything, tygr. Weird.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.777
-Watch. Signs of a fight.
-Now, Monkian.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.710
-What is ...?
-A trap.

03:39.185 --> 03:44.885
Network's edge, tygr.
Lift, so we crept out.

03:45.058 --> 03:49.586
I can not.
The threads are sticky.

03:49.762 --> 03:57.888
Yes, the Thundercats. You are equally
helpless as insects in a network.

03:58.705 --> 04:02.072
You will not le -

04:02.242 --> 04:05.999
-when the other Thundercats
come here, Slyth.

04:08.314 --> 04:14.444
"We want them to come here.
-You may well call for them?

04:15.288 --> 04:20.800
-Come on, open your mouth. Shout.
"They do not scream.

04:20.959 --> 04:26.592
Thundercats know
when someone else is in danger.

04:31.237 --> 04:35.333
I have a weird feeling
that something is wrong out there ...

04:35.575 --> 04:39.666
... but I can not see
past where the thick trees.

04:51.624 --> 04:56.027
-O-Lion. Thundercats is in danger.
"I heard it, Panthro.

04:56.195 --> 04:59.999
Omens sword
give me sight beyond sight.

05:01.534 --> 05:05.900
It is tygr and Cheetara.
Mutants have caught them in a network.

05:06.039 --> 05:09.372
They seem to be in. ..
Yes! They are in the jungle.

05:09.542 --> 05:12.875
And I know exactly where somewhere.
Damn mutants!

05:13.046 --> 05:18.666
"I knew there was something fishy.
-Take us there quickly, Panthro.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.999
It is their Thunder Tank.
Quickly. Take your positions.

05:31.631 --> 05:36.999
It's Thunderbird idea, tygr.
The engine is known ever again.

05:37.236 --> 05:41.444
And it is heading for the mutant
trap because of us.

05:42.642 --> 05:46.043
-There 's them.
"There's something strange about the network.

05:46.212 --> 05:49.900
Cheetara and tygr should
easily have come off.

05:50.049 --> 05:55.300
"They seem to be glued.
"I cut them loose.

05:55.455 --> 05:59.391
Mutants is more than you.
Thunder tank can handle it.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.891
No, Panthro. It is too big.

06:02.061 --> 06:08.100
-Then you will harm them.
-Yes, check.

06:15.508 --> 06:17.666
Backa, Cheetara.

06:25.284 --> 06:30.200
"They are free.
-Not yet. Attack!

06:36.462 --> 06:40.400
Cheetara. -Tygr.
Move on you.

06:44.303 --> 06:48.900
-Fall back!
-Run for cover!

07:00.119 --> 07:05.700
-Why do they not?
"They are trying in all cases.

07:05.992 --> 07:08.444
It's degrading.

07:09.462 --> 07:13.888
We might as well fight
with lertårtor against them.

07:14.333 --> 07:18.269
Our technology is equally
advanced as Thundercats.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.635
No, it is more advanced ...

07:21.808 --> 07:27.303
... but they managed to save the
mostly when the spaceship crashed.

07:27.513 --> 07:34.009
Yes. While our ship is
buried in the desert.

07:34.187 --> 07:38.900
It may Mumm-Ra fixation.
He must go there again.

07:39.025 --> 07:44.200
We must get our
super weapons again. I promise.

07:44.397 --> 07:47.798
Give it to me, yes?

07:50.136 --> 07:53.333
You mighty, hear us.

07:54.173 --> 08:00.333
We ask that you listen to us.
Mumm-Ra ... The immortal ...

08:04.116 --> 08:12.500
What are you doing here?
I have not asked you to come here.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.388
We will, for your ways, sir ...</ i>

08:15.561 --> 08:19.520
It's just Thundercats
which stands between the Mumm-Ra ...

08:19.699 --> 08:25.100
... and his dominion
of the third world.

08:25.271 --> 08:29.731
And it was your mission to
destroy the Thundercats.

08:29.909 --> 08:36.500
A mission that you have
failed so many times.

08:36.749 --> 08:41.100
Forgive me, you big ...
It's your fault ...

08:41.254 --> 08:47.200
When you cut our spaceship
deprived us of our weapons

08:47.326 --> 08:51.999
-which could relieve third grounding
from Thundercats forever.

08:53.566 --> 09:00.062
You want it back where the super -
weapons for your own gain.

09:00.239 --> 09:05.472
But our, your, you are mighty.

09:05.645 --> 09:12.600
When we are equal
Thundercats you do not need -

09:12.718 --> 09:15.448
-make your grave as often.

09:15.621 --> 09:22.600
It's only me to worry
me when I leave it or not.

09:22.862 --> 09:27.026
Of course, you are mighty. I just ...

09:27.199 --> 09:33.700
Never mind.
You have a point.

09:35.775 --> 09:41.179
I will be traveling your ship
But be careful, mutants ...

09:41.347 --> 09:48.700
Remember, Mumm-Ra ...
Are you a master.

09:48.921 --> 09:53.756
It is we, Mumm-Ra.

09:54.226 --> 09:58.925
Go to the sunken space ship then.

10:00.933 --> 10:04.027
Evil spirits ...

10:04.203 --> 10:10.608
... transform this
body of Mumm-Ra ...

10:10.776 --> 10:13.444
... the immortal!

10:22.188 --> 10:28.149
Do you really think Mumm-Ra
will do it, Slyth?

10:28.327 --> 10:34.323
Yes. As I said, he needs us.

10:34.500 --> 10:38.800
How can you be so sure, Slyth?

10:40.239 --> 10:44.039
His powers are limitless.

10:44.210 --> 10:49.910
Really? Why must he
always return to his grave -

10:50.082 --> 10:53.550
-if he does not fill in their power?

11:14.073 --> 11:19.375
Nothing. The ship has no power.

11:20.746 --> 11:25.774
SkyCutters is battle ready.
NoseDiver also.

11:26.085 --> 11:31.999
And most of our equipment
could be moved to Plun-Darr intact.

11:34.660 --> 11:41.666
At last, we learn mutants
Thundercats what respect is.

11:53.112 --> 11:58.555
I'm sorry, tygr. Things
from the network takes forever to remove.

11:58.918 --> 12:03.900
If MESS is the only thing they can
throw at us so we'll survive.

12:05.091 --> 12:07.222
What was that?

12:08.227 --> 12:12.800
-Skycraft. We are attacked.
-Skycraft? Whose?

12:12.998 --> 12:16.999
-Do you recognize them?
"I can not see so well.

12:22.441 --> 12:25.500
It is SkyCutters. The mutant shipping.

12:25.611 --> 12:28.171
I thought that the equipment was destroyed.

12:28.347 --> 12:33.555
Not entirely, it seems.
But I will get down, now!

12:40.259 --> 12:43.786
-You approach, Panthro.
-Not enough.

12:43.963 --> 12:46.555
SkyCutters is too easy to steer.

12:52.037 --> 12:55.803
We are attacked on the ground also.
A land vehicle.

12:55.975 --> 12:57.999
Take over here, tygr.

13:17.296 --> 13:22.888
"He tries to hide among the trees.
"It is not enough.

13:29.275 --> 13:32.142
He is fast. That much I can say.

13:33.512 --> 13:38.142
-There he is, Panthro. Over the hill.
And here we go.

13:49.728 --> 13:52.060
The thing is amphibious, Panthro.

13:52.231 --> 13:57.800
"He cheated us of the cliff.
"We also have an ace in the sleeve.

13:58.037 --> 14:02.997
Thunderbird idea can equally
happy to go on the seabed.

14:05.945 --> 14:08.743
But not on the roof.

14:08.914 --> 14:13.999
There is diving under the seat.
I activate the airlock.

14:20.059 --> 14:25.666
It does not help.
We may collect the other Thundercats.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.777
Panthro. Reef.

14:33.739 --> 14:35.888
A cave.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.513
When the monster attacked the next time,
we swim together out -

14:48.687 --> 14:54.500
-attract the mutant
ship ... and part of us.

14:56.028 --> 14:58.333
Now!

15:13.145 --> 15:17.275
Power module does not work.

15:18.150 --> 15:22.229
He is detained.
Swim to the surface.

15:25.291 --> 15:32.225
"We have to get back and retrieve the equipment.
-SkyCutters!

15:34.800 --> 15:38.258
We must see what we can do with
Thunderbird idea itself, Panthro.

15:38.437 --> 15:42.555
The others from Thundercats
must take care of SkyCutters.

15:45.444 --> 15:52.000
Thunder, thunder, thunder,
Thundercats, ho!

15:57.623 --> 16:01.457
Monkian, the signal source
on the other from the Thundercats.

16:01.627 --> 16:07.327
And? They are easy to fix
with our SkyCutters.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.231
Where is it?

16:13.739 --> 16:19.300
We can not see them in the jungle ...
but they are down there, guaranteed.

16:19.945 --> 16:23.676
Converts to another attack.

16:30.589 --> 16:35.083
-Do you see something, Jack Electric?
-No, not yet.

16:35.260 --> 16:38.093
Yes. There is one.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.999
Where did he go?

17:00.519 --> 17:03.283
Are you looking for me, mutant?

17:20.071 --> 17:22.563
I can not see.

17:31.483 --> 17:36.700
-Sea-quin.
"They are usually supposed to be nice.

17:36.822 --> 17:41.282
Maybe. But we have
annoyed them more than anything.

17:41.460 --> 17:45.954
Panthro. A little Sea-Quine.
It's stuck in Thunderbird idea.

17:46.165 --> 17:51.555
Help me pressing, Lion-O.
Now we have to really move on this.

17:53.105 --> 17:56.802
Sea-Quine sees that we are trying
help. The press also.

17:56.975 --> 18:01.173
But it does not help much.
We upset the barely.

18:01.346 --> 18:03.555
Wait a minute.

18:05.951 --> 18:10.555
Do you think you can pull away
Thunderbird idea of your children?

18:14.960 --> 18:20.626
It moved. But the idea falls Thunder
over the edge, we may lose it forever.

18:20.799 --> 18:26.500
We can always replace it.
But we can never replace a life.

18:26.738 --> 18:28.888
Pull!

18:29.808 --> 18:35.500
Mutant.
And he has been running his ship again.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.174
It was perhaps lucky there.

18:55.868 --> 19:02.888
It damaged my NoseDiver.
If only I could get to the beach.

19:03.876 --> 19:08.999
"He will survive.
-Here are your children.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.015
That was all right again.

19:14.920 --> 19:20.400
Where is it?
Thundercatsignalen was here.

19:20.526 --> 19:24.053
Why worry?
We took good care of the mutants?

19:24.229 --> 19:28.290
We have not seen Slyth.
And he is the worst.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.666
Look!

19:35.741 --> 19:41.500
Have you tested the idea in Thunderbird
water, and called us here for that?

19:41.680 --> 19:43.875
If it was a test, we passed.

19:44.049 --> 19:48.999
Now that the mutants have been returned
their weapons, it is a totally new thing.

19:49.488 --> 19:52.423
They must have got up their spaceship.

19:52.591 --> 19:58.777
They could not have done it themselves.
There is something else behind.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.491
Mumm-Ra.

20:01.667 --> 20:06.104
"We must be very careful.
-Yes. Evil never rests.

20:06.271 --> 20:11.333
Or worse,
it will not let anyone else sleep either.

20:20.552 --> 20:26.980
It seemed like you did
s better to Thundercats than before.

20:27.159 --> 20:31.459
We had bad luck, Mumm-Ra.
Our ships can be repaired.

20:31.630 --> 20:40.400
And now we can build more powerful weapons.
"It's not what I want!

20:40.639 --> 20:44.666
The equipment you mentioned
to the castle Plun-Darr ...

20:44.843 --> 20:48.999
... you should leave
back to the spaceship.

20:49.848 --> 20:53.375
No, Mumm-Ra.
That we will not do.

20:53.552 --> 20:58.922
Are you challenging me, reptile?

20:59.091 --> 21:01.184
Never, you are mighty.

21:01.360 --> 21:07.492
We just want to be more
useful for you, Mumm-Ra.

21:09.868 --> 21:15.400
Do you? In this case ...

21:20.946 --> 21:24.848
... Let's see ...
