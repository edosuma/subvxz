00:03.714 --> 00:04.918
<i>Trouble in paradise?</i>

00:04.919 --> 00:06.452
<i>Turner and I did</i>
<i>a joint task force</i>

00:06.454 --> 00:07.670
<i>together eight years ago.</i>

00:07.672 --> 00:08.621
<i>His name is Isaak...</i>

00:08.623 --> 00:09.989
<i>Sidorov.</i>

00:09.991 --> 00:10.990
He's an arms dealer that

00:10.992 --> 00:11.991
the task force was monitoring

00:11.993 --> 00:13.209
when I was working with Turner.

00:13.211 --> 00:15.044
He gets Turner, he gets
the name of the agents.

00:15.046 --> 00:17.263
Sidorov knew
there were more bombs.

00:17.265 --> 00:19.098
Where are these agents located?
All over.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.349
Houston, Philadelphia,

00:20.351 --> 00:21.684
Detroit.

00:21.686 --> 00:23.803
Each one of those could have
a nuclear bomb.

00:29.076 --> 00:31.844
All seven cities online?

00:31.846 --> 00:33.529
Dallas and New York
are audio only.

00:33.531 --> 00:35.347
We have video
for the rest.

00:35.349 --> 00:36.399
Status, please.

00:36.401 --> 00:37.700
New York, phase line green.

00:37.702 --> 00:38.901

00:41.623 --> 00:43.022
Dallas, phase line green.

00:43.024 --> 00:44.490
Chicago is phase line green.

00:44.492 --> 00:45.992
Director Lange, status?

00:45.994 --> 00:48.077
San Diego, status?

00:48.079 --> 00:49.795
San Diego,
phase line green.

00:49.797 --> 00:52.999
San Diego is phase line green.

00:53.001 --> 00:55.367
I have the command.

00:55.369 --> 00:57.336
Three, two, one.

00:57.338 --> 01:00.640
Execute, execute, execute.

01:18.892 --> 01:21.077
Mr. Andrews?

01:21.895 --> 01:23.663
I live across the street.

01:23.665 --> 01:26.532
UPS dropped off your
package at my house.

01:26.534 --> 01:28.467
Honey, just leave it.

01:28.469 --> 01:30.453
We're going to be late for work.

01:32.456 --> 01:34.540
Mr. Andrews?

01:34.542 --> 01:35.591
Babe, just leave it!

01:35.593 --> 01:37.593
Not coming out.

01:37.595 --> 01:39.095
Initiate on three. My count.

01:43.350 --> 01:45.217
One, two, three.

01:53.310 --> 01:55.528
Federal agents!

01:55.530 --> 01:56.829
Put your hands
in the air!

02:07.708 --> 02:09.908
Federal agents!

02:27.511 --> 02:30.229
Target's deceased.

02:30.231 --> 02:31.597
We have a homicide.

02:31.599 --> 02:33.432
Target is deceased.

02:33.434 --> 02:34.600
Target appears
to have been tortured.

02:34.602 --> 02:36.185
Target has been killed.
Target has been killed.

02:36.187 --> 02:38.337
Target has been killed.

03:03.565 --> 03:04.864
We got beat.

03:04.866 --> 03:06.599
Sidorov's guys got
here before us.

03:06.601 --> 03:08.451
Used this to waterboard him.

03:08.453 --> 03:10.653
Tortured him to find
out if he had a bomb,

03:10.655 --> 03:13.773
and if he did, where it was.

03:13.775 --> 03:15.875
All right, his name is
Michael Andrews, he's 66.

03:15.877 --> 03:19.629
He's a former member of a San
Diego teacher's union and AARP.

03:19.631 --> 03:21.381
So the house has been
thoroughly searched.

03:21.383 --> 03:23.082
All of it?
Every single inch.

03:23.084 --> 03:24.617
Well, if they found
what they wanted,

03:24.619 --> 03:25.835
they would have
stopped and left.

03:25.837 --> 03:27.620
Oh, Sidorov's guys
are former FSB. Pros.

03:27.622 --> 03:28.971
Or they could have found

03:28.973 --> 03:32.058
what they were looking for
quickly, tore up the house...

03:32.060 --> 03:33.810
To make it look like
they didn't find anything.

03:33.812 --> 03:34.811
Exactly.

03:34.813 --> 03:35.895
Are we sure this guy

03:35.897 --> 03:36.929
was a Russian sleeper agent?

03:36.931 --> 03:38.181
He was on Turner's list.

03:38.183 --> 03:39.348
And so far, Turner's been right

03:39.350 --> 03:40.433
every step of the way.

03:40.435 --> 03:42.151
San Diego team?
Go ahead.

03:42.153 --> 03:43.519
He was tortured?

03:43.521 --> 03:45.104
You psychic?

03:45.106 --> 03:46.739
All nine sleeper agents

03:46.741 --> 03:51.143
in the other seven cities
were also tortured and killed.

03:51.779 --> 03:53.496
Sidorov's got seven teams.

03:53.498 --> 03:54.814
One in every city.

03:54.816 --> 03:56.249
That's an expensive operation.

03:56.251 --> 03:58.034
A nuclear bomb in the open
market would go for millions.

03:58.036 --> 03:59.419
It's not a bad investment.

03:59.421 --> 04:02.121
Any evidence that they actually
had possession of the bombs?

04:02.123 --> 04:05.875
No, but the FBI is just
beginning its investigations.

04:05.877 --> 04:07.326
As are we.

04:07.328 --> 04:10.363
I don't have
to tell you to make haste.

04:10.365 --> 04:11.964
No, you don't.

04:11.966 --> 04:13.850
You figure out if this
guy has a nuclear bomb

04:13.852 --> 04:15.301
in San Diego,
and if he does...

04:15.303 --> 04:16.519
Find it fast.

04:16.521 --> 04:18.036
Thank you.

04:18.039 --> 04:19.738
If we don't, Sidorov will.

04:19.741 --> 04:21.690
Got it.

04:26.346 --> 04:28.014
Don't look

04:28.016 --> 04:29.699
so happy to see me.

04:29.701 --> 04:31.484
I alerted the
Assistant Director.

04:31.486 --> 04:33.853
You know things are bad
when she calls me.

04:33.855 --> 04:35.505
What can you tell me
about Sidorov?

04:35.507 --> 04:39.142
He's a former FSB,
worked in Putin's network.

04:39.144 --> 04:41.360
As of eight years ago,
he used his connections

04:41.362 --> 04:43.296
to become a major
international arms broker.

04:43.298 --> 04:44.664
Our current thinking is

04:44.666 --> 04:47.617
that FSB hired Sidorov
to investigate Turner.

04:47.619 --> 04:50.236
Because Turner discovered
the old Russian sleeper agents.

04:50.238 --> 04:51.471
Exactly. Sidorov realized

04:51.473 --> 04:53.306
that the agents may still
have the nuclear bombs.

04:53.308 --> 04:55.224
And he got the big idea
to take those weapons

04:55.226 --> 04:56.592
and sell them
on the open market.

04:56.594 --> 04:59.762
How did Sidorov get
to the sleeper agents before us?

04:59.764 --> 05:01.180
FSB inherited
KGB files,

05:01.182 --> 05:03.149
so there's a good
chance they had access

05:03.151 --> 05:05.568
to the list of names
of the Cold War agents.

05:05.570 --> 05:06.719
Despite a regime change,

05:06.721 --> 05:08.621
you don't just lose track
of nuclear weapons.

05:08.623 --> 05:09.972
So, Sidorov is here
inside the U.S.?

05:09.974 --> 05:11.274
He's traveling

05:11.276 --> 05:13.109
on a diplomatic passport.

05:13.111 --> 05:14.360
As of now,
we can't connect Sidorov

05:14.362 --> 05:15.928
to Turner or the weapons.

05:15.930 --> 05:18.915
And if we were to deport him,
he'd know that we're on to him.

05:18.917 --> 05:20.700
He could hide those bombs
any place.

05:20.702 --> 05:23.069
We need to find Sidorov now
before he disappears.

05:23.071 --> 05:24.587
I've got a dozen Kaleidoscope
searches running,

05:24.589 --> 05:27.573
and facial-recognition alerts on
all the international borders.

05:27.575 --> 05:28.758
We're also tracking down any

05:28.760 --> 05:30.893
of Sidorov's known associates
here in the U.S.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.912
Mr. Callen, Mr. Hanna,

05:32.914 --> 05:34.213
perhaps it's time

05:34.215 --> 05:36.799
to have a conversation
with Arkady Kolcheck.

05:36.801 --> 05:38.034
He's former KGB.

05:38.036 --> 05:40.386
Sometimes
I think he still is.

05:55.369 --> 05:57.904
Had to meet
all the way out here?

05:57.906 --> 06:00.273
It's a delicate subject matter.

06:00.275 --> 06:02.291
Sidorov makes
you that nervous?

06:02.293 --> 06:03.709
He should make <i>you</i> that nervous.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.328
He's a disciplined
psychopath.

06:05.330 --> 06:07.947
Sidorov goes after
Russian mafia, they back off.

06:07.949 --> 06:09.215
I'm terrified.

06:09.217 --> 06:10.766
Where can we find him?

06:10.768 --> 06:11.968
Not easy.

06:11.970 --> 06:14.337
He makes big arms deals,
then disappears for years.

06:14.339 --> 06:15.805
He doesn't go out
in public much.

06:15.807 --> 06:17.840
This is what
we came out here for?

06:17.842 --> 06:19.625
I met him three times.

06:19.627 --> 06:21.477
All he talked about was wine.

06:21.479 --> 06:22.929
He collects.

06:22.931 --> 06:25.731
Buys thousands of
cases at a time.

06:25.733 --> 06:29.352
He uses the wine as a way
to bank some of his money.

06:29.354 --> 06:31.988
Keeps it in cities
all over the world.

06:31.990 --> 06:33.489
- Eric.
- Go.

06:33.491 --> 06:35.491
Apparently, Sidorov
has a little wine fetish.

06:35.493 --> 06:37.610
Why don't you start looking
into wine-storage facilities?

06:37.612 --> 06:40.580
We're looking for tenants that
have large, long-term leases.

06:40.582 --> 06:41.948
Got it.

06:41.950 --> 06:43.666
What do you know
about Soviet agents

06:43.668 --> 06:45.334
with nuclear weapons
in the U.S.?

06:45.336 --> 06:47.587
Back in the day,
I heard whispers,

06:47.589 --> 06:48.988
but I didn't believe it.

06:48.990 --> 06:50.990
Why?

06:50.992 --> 06:53.826
Because to be discovered
doing something like this

06:53.828 --> 06:55.962
would be beyond
Cuban Missile Crisis.

06:55.964 --> 06:57.997
It would cause political
rift for decades.

06:57.999 --> 07:00.132
Not to mention
start a nuclear war.

07:00.134 --> 07:02.768
Let's play "what if?"

07:02.770 --> 07:05.438
If there were agents in the U.S.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.773
armed with nuclear weapons,

07:07.775 --> 07:10.226
there would be very few of them.

07:10.228 --> 07:12.478
Like everything else
about Cold War,

07:12.480 --> 07:14.013
it is about threat, not action.

07:14.015 --> 07:17.233
Like one in each of the eight
largest cities in the U.S.?

07:19.519 --> 07:21.704
You found one?

07:22.990 --> 07:25.241
Dear God.

07:25.243 --> 07:26.792
Got to love
the old U.S.S.R.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.878
Oh, don't be naive.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.246
We both spent decades

07:30.248 --> 07:32.798
pointing nuclear weapons
at each other's children.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.801
Neither of our countries
had clean hands in this.

07:35.803 --> 07:38.554
Clearly, neither of them
had any sanity, either.

07:40.007 --> 07:42.341
I've never seen
Arkady that worried.

07:42.343 --> 07:43.809
You believe him?

07:43.811 --> 07:46.045
I do now.

07:46.047 --> 07:47.229
You seeing this?

07:47.231 --> 07:48.731
Yup. They've been
tailing us since

07:48.733 --> 07:49.849
we left Arkady.

07:49.851 --> 07:51.233
Any ideas
about who they are?

07:51.235 --> 07:52.601
Let's find out.

07:52.603 --> 07:55.021
Get a little distance from 'em.

07:58.860 --> 07:59.909
You got another gun?

07:59.911 --> 08:01.894
It's in the glove box.

08:05.332 --> 08:06.599
Turn here.

08:13.925 --> 08:16.108
Use this alley.

08:32.058 --> 08:35.361
Get out with your hands up!

08:41.400 --> 08:44.269
Are you armed?

08:44.270 --> 08:46.839
No... but he is.

08:55.133 --> 08:59.085
Well, well, well.

08:59.087 --> 09:02.054
Sam Hanna. Been a while.

09:02.056 --> 09:07.143
G, meet Michael Snyder, CIA.

09:07.145 --> 09:09.562
Agent G. Callen.

09:09.564 --> 09:11.480
He also worked on the task
force with Turner and me.

09:11.482 --> 09:14.233
I never liked him.

09:14.235 --> 09:16.268
Something tells me
he doesn't like you, either.

09:16.270 --> 09:19.155
Some things never change.

09:19.157 --> 09:21.340
And never will.

09:31.737 --> 09:32.795
Guess you guys
don't think

09:32.796 --> 09:33.978
Turner was such a nut after all.

09:33.980 --> 09:35.313
Well, just 'cause
Turner was right

09:35.315 --> 09:36.497
doesn't mean he wasn't crazy.

09:36.499 --> 09:38.466
He gave his life
for his country.

09:38.468 --> 09:39.717
Best thing he probably
could have done with it.

09:39.719 --> 09:40.968
See, now I don't like him.

09:40.970 --> 09:42.937
I don't even think
his mom likes him.

09:42.939 --> 09:45.690
Something tells me his guys
aren't fond of him, either.

09:45.692 --> 09:48.175
Fellas, you like Snyder?

09:48.177 --> 09:50.027
Come on, you
can be honest.

09:50.029 --> 09:53.681
Snyder knows he's a little
pompous, a little smug.

09:53.683 --> 09:55.650
Aw. I missed you, too.

09:55.652 --> 09:58.453
So, do you know
where Sidorov is?

09:58.455 --> 10:01.205
He's somewhere here in the U.S.
We don't know where.

10:01.207 --> 10:02.490
Your turn.

10:02.492 --> 10:03.991
We have to tread lightly.

10:03.993 --> 10:05.410
Sidorov is protected

10:05.412 --> 10:07.862
from high up the political
food chain in Russia.

10:07.864 --> 10:09.029
Tread lightly?

10:09.031 --> 10:11.249
We're talking about
nuclear weapons.

10:11.251 --> 10:13.668
So far, there's only been one,
and we recovered it.

10:13.670 --> 10:15.720
No, I believe <i>we</i> recovered it.

10:15.722 --> 10:16.921
You got a plan?

10:16.923 --> 10:18.306
It's pretty clear,
don't you think?

10:18.308 --> 10:20.541
If Sidorov has acquired
a nuclear weapon--

10:20.543 --> 10:23.878
and that's a big if--
we're gonna find him,

10:23.880 --> 10:27.014
attempt to get an agent close
to him, inside his operation.

10:27.016 --> 10:30.435
And this is the reason
we're talking, Sam.

10:30.437 --> 10:32.987
You seem to be the one
doing all the talking.

10:32.989 --> 10:35.056
We both know
we can't start from scratch.

10:35.058 --> 10:39.160
It'd take far too long
to get an agent undercover.

10:39.162 --> 10:42.229
We need someone
Sidorov already trusts.

10:42.231 --> 10:45.700
Give Sidorov an enemy,
make him turn to an old friend.

10:45.702 --> 10:47.618
You've played this game
before, Sam.

10:47.620 --> 10:50.621
See, that's why
I don't like you.

10:50.623 --> 10:52.924
'Cause this isn't a game.

10:52.926 --> 10:54.742
Can we move forward, Sam?

10:56.011 --> 10:59.413
If this remains a joint
NCIS, CIA mission.

10:59.415 --> 11:01.015
You're irrelevant;
I'm talking with him.

11:01.017 --> 11:02.383
Then we got no deal.

11:09.274 --> 11:11.275
Okay.

11:11.277 --> 11:13.895
Well played.

11:15.781 --> 11:18.566
Joint mission.

11:18.568 --> 11:20.151
Soon as we find Sidorov,
we start.

11:20.153 --> 11:21.869
Deal?

11:21.871 --> 11:25.156
You call us when you find him,
then you'll be relevant to us.

11:25.158 --> 11:27.375
Move your car.

11:38.220 --> 11:39.754
Anything on Sidorov?

11:39.756 --> 11:40.755
Nothing,

11:40.757 --> 11:41.756
and it's not by accident.

11:41.758 --> 11:42.840
This guy is careful.

11:42.842 --> 11:44.258
He must switch cars,

11:44.260 --> 11:46.394
he doesn't drop credit cards
with his own name on them.

11:46.396 --> 11:48.796
- Where's Granger?
- He's camped out with Hetty.

11:48.798 --> 11:51.482
He wants to be called as soon
as we find something on Sidorov.

11:52.634 --> 11:54.819
I need you to call me first.

11:58.306 --> 12:00.741
If I have any favors
to call in with you two,

12:00.743 --> 12:02.610
I'm calling
'em in now.

12:04.646 --> 12:07.281
Anything.

12:07.283 --> 12:09.116
It's personal.

12:09.118 --> 12:10.284
You don't have to explain.

12:10.286 --> 12:12.003
Thank you.

12:12.005 --> 12:15.990
Sam, let me talk
to you outside.

12:18.844 --> 12:20.995
I'll protect Eric and Nell
from Granger.

12:20.997 --> 12:22.263
It won't come back
on 'em.

12:22.265 --> 12:23.664
That's not it.

12:23.666 --> 12:25.099
Then what?

12:25.101 --> 12:28.386
We're all in this together.

12:28.388 --> 12:30.354
I just need to know
what the play is.

12:30.356 --> 12:35.026
Turner, Snyder, me-- we were
all part of the task force.

12:35.028 --> 12:36.844
Three other agents
were put undercover

12:36.846 --> 12:39.480
to get close to Sidorov.

12:39.482 --> 12:41.849
First one never made it
out of the gate.

12:41.851 --> 12:43.701
Second one was found dead--

12:43.703 --> 12:45.903
skinned alive.

12:45.905 --> 12:48.623
If this is too dangerous,
you don't have to do this.

12:48.625 --> 12:51.358
This is a major
national security breach.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.526
We're talking
millions of lives.

12:52.528 --> 12:53.878
I can't turn away.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.296
And finding somebody
else would take too long

12:55.298 --> 12:56.797
and it probably wouldn't work.

12:56.799 --> 13:00.367
Snyder's has the right plan,
but he's too cavalier

13:00.369 --> 13:02.336
with the lives of his agents.

13:02.338 --> 13:04.972
We have to get close
to Sidorov first.

13:04.974 --> 13:06.257
Then we can run this.

13:06.259 --> 13:09.310
Granger's never going to let
us withhold from the CIA.

13:09.312 --> 13:10.928
As soon as Eric
finds Sidorov,

13:10.930 --> 13:13.147
he's going
to bring in Snyder.

13:14.816 --> 13:16.884
Michael Andrews worked
at a public school

13:16.886 --> 13:18.119
two miles away from his home.

13:18.121 --> 13:19.070
Now,

13:19.072 --> 13:20.271
assuming
the vehicles were disabled

13:20.273 --> 13:21.555
during a nuclear attack,

13:21.557 --> 13:24.342
he'd want the bomb
in close proximity to his home

13:24.344 --> 13:25.543
and the school.

13:25.545 --> 13:30.164
That gives us roughly
a one-mile overlapping area.

13:30.166 --> 13:32.466
Pierce's bomb was kept
at a storage facility.

13:32.468 --> 13:35.703
No storage facilities
in the overlapping area.

13:35.705 --> 13:37.505
What the hell?

13:37.507 --> 13:39.874
Okay, those

13:39.876 --> 13:42.677
are used for lifting
heavy glass.

13:42.679 --> 13:44.578
This guy's a teacher.

13:44.580 --> 13:45.763
So why does he have them?

13:45.765 --> 13:47.915
Nell, pull the
house permits.

13:47.917 --> 13:51.769
Okay, the house was originally
permitted for a small basement,

13:51.771 --> 13:54.105
but the final plans
were changed.

13:54.107 --> 13:55.106
So there was no basement?

13:55.108 --> 13:56.423
Yeah.

13:56.425 --> 13:57.424
We'll call you back.

13:57.426 --> 13:59.860
We also surveyed
the exterior foundation.

13:59.862 --> 14:01.862
It's a solid slab.

14:01.864 --> 14:02.980
Okay.

14:02.982 --> 14:04.431
Riverdance.

14:04.433 --> 14:05.466
What?

14:05.468 --> 14:06.617
Riverdance.

14:06.619 --> 14:08.536
What?
Riverdance!

14:08.538 --> 14:10.705
River...

14:14.209 --> 14:17.111
You heard the man-- Riverdance.

14:23.635 --> 14:25.619
Hey, over here.

14:25.621 --> 14:28.339
Move the table and chairs.

14:28.341 --> 14:29.557
I got it.

14:33.061 --> 14:35.980
Let's go.

14:35.982 --> 14:38.065
You hear that?

14:38.067 --> 14:39.517
Sounds different.
Yeah, it does.

14:41.603 --> 14:43.437
Grab the suckers.

14:43.439 --> 14:45.639
It's the edge.

14:45.991 --> 14:48.192
Right there.

14:51.947 --> 14:52.997
On three.

14:52.999 --> 14:56.617
One, two, three,
nice and easy.

14:58.537 --> 15:00.821
Whoa.

15:01.991 --> 15:04.208
Well, that does not look
like a wine cellar.

15:10.382 --> 15:12.133
I need a flashlight.

15:12.135 --> 15:13.500
Got it.

15:13.502 --> 15:16.303
We got a facial recognition hit
on a security camera

15:16.305 --> 15:19.173
at a wine storage facility
in Hollywood.

15:19.175 --> 15:20.558
Who is that?

15:20.560 --> 15:22.176
Name is Greshnev.

15:22.178 --> 15:24.344
We tracked him down
because of this photo.

15:24.346 --> 15:25.312
He is an associate

15:25.314 --> 15:26.847
of Sidorov.

15:26.849 --> 15:28.733
I tracked Greshnev's car
via traffic cameras

15:28.735 --> 15:31.819
to the Rosslyn Hotel
here in Los Angeles.

15:31.821 --> 15:34.071
So we scanned
the hotel security footage

15:34.073 --> 15:35.756
and we found this.

15:35.758 --> 15:37.241
It's from 40 minutes ago.

15:44.049 --> 15:46.217
We found Sidorov?

15:47.552 --> 15:48.753
Where is that?

15:48.755 --> 15:49.720
That is

15:49.722 --> 15:51.305
the Rosslyn Hotel.

15:51.307 --> 15:52.723
Well, is he still there?

15:54.426 --> 15:55.392
Yeah.

15:55.394 --> 15:56.477
Let's get in touch with Snyder,

15:56.479 --> 15:57.728
tell him we found Sidorov.

15:57.730 --> 15:59.146
Nell, we found something.
Ooh.

15:59.148 --> 16:00.881
Kensi said she found something.

16:00.883 --> 16:03.818
Here's the feed.

16:03.820 --> 16:04.852
What are we looking at?

16:04.854 --> 16:07.021
It's a room under the house.

16:07.023 --> 16:08.055
What'd you find?

16:08.057 --> 16:10.775
Well, it's more
about what we didn't find.

16:10.777 --> 16:12.359
You seeing this?

16:12.361 --> 16:13.828
Geiger.
Here you go.

16:13.830 --> 16:15.246
Deeks.

16:19.535 --> 16:21.452
We find Sidorov?

16:21.454 --> 16:23.287
Yeah, he's here in L.A.

16:23.289 --> 16:24.839
Well, that's a good thing...

16:24.841 --> 16:29.110
'cause he has
at least one nuclear bomb.

16:38.355 --> 16:40.240
Get the FBI's render safe unit

16:40.242 --> 16:42.659
and make them aware that we're
missing a nuclear weapon.

16:42.661 --> 16:43.794
Got it.

16:43.796 --> 16:45.295
Get me Agent Snyder.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.966
I'll get Snyder.

16:49.968 --> 16:51.968
We need
to arrange a meet.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.571
Go fast, we got
to get moving.

16:56.591 --> 16:58.675
Can someone please tell me
how functional

16:58.677 --> 17:02.145
a 35-year-old
nuclear bomb is?

17:02.147 --> 17:04.263
Uh...

17:04.266 --> 17:08.318
well, uh, do you know much
about nuclear fusion?

17:08.319 --> 17:10.103
The basics.
Then,

17:10.105 --> 17:12.055
let me use the touch screen
to illustrate.

17:12.057 --> 17:14.191
Is it necessary?

17:14.193 --> 17:18.127
Well, you know what they say--
devil's in the details.

17:18.130 --> 17:20.864
I think it would be helpful

17:20.866 --> 17:22.499
if we all had
a better understanding

17:22.501 --> 17:23.750
of what we were dealing with.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.167
Quickly.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.569
Okay.

17:26.570 --> 17:29.405
Now, for reliability reasons,

17:29.407 --> 17:33.076
the type of weapon
the Russians would have

17:33.078 --> 17:36.513
is a gun-type nuclear weapon.

17:36.515 --> 17:40.050
There are some
conventional explosives

17:40.052 --> 17:41.718
here at this end

17:41.720 --> 17:45.222
that would shoot
nuclear material through...

17:45.224 --> 17:47.757
a tube into

17:47.759 --> 17:51.528
nuclear material
at the other end,

17:51.530 --> 17:53.396
thus creating a...

17:53.398 --> 17:54.464
Anyone, anyone?

17:54.466 --> 17:55.932
Assistant Director Granger.

17:55.934 --> 17:57.234
...nuclear reaction.

17:57.236 --> 17:58.485
Yeah, I've heard
all this before.

17:58.487 --> 18:00.270
It's fascinating.

18:00.272 --> 18:01.538
You know,
just for the fun of it,

18:01.540 --> 18:04.207
let's take a look at the math.

18:06.777 --> 18:11.414
I can't cross the CIA or NCIS

18:11.416 --> 18:13.466
with an operation
that's this important

18:13.468 --> 18:15.168
to national security.

18:15.170 --> 18:16.636
We just need time,
Hetty.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.271
We're putting the mission
in play regardless.

18:18.273 --> 18:19.673
It's the same plan

18:19.675 --> 18:20.807
that Snyder proposed.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.092
If we place the agent,

18:22.094 --> 18:24.394
then we can control the mission
and keep the agent safe.

18:24.396 --> 18:25.345
We could

18:25.347 --> 18:27.347
all be discharged for this.

18:27.349 --> 18:28.965
I don't give a damn.

18:30.601 --> 18:32.569
Well, of course.

18:32.571 --> 18:33.803
Why would you?

18:35.740 --> 18:38.575
Now, if the conventional
explosive degraded over time,

18:38.577 --> 18:39.943
it would have to be replaced.

18:39.945 --> 18:42.379
Something as common
as C-4 would work.

18:42.381 --> 18:43.079
Oh.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.080
Nell.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.866
Does Sidorov need

18:45.868 --> 18:47.617
a nuclear scientist to do this?

18:47.619 --> 18:49.953
Hmm, good question.

18:49.955 --> 18:52.155
All he would need is
a high-level ballistics expert.

18:52.157 --> 18:54.374
So the answer is yes,
the bombs are viable.

18:54.376 --> 18:55.208
Short answer?

18:55.210 --> 18:56.492
Yeah, short answer.

18:56.494 --> 18:58.428
Depends on what your
definition of "viable" is.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.714
Boom.

19:00.716 --> 19:03.049
That's my definition.

19:03.051 --> 19:05.051
Will they go boom?

19:05.053 --> 19:08.171
Boom?

19:09.941 --> 19:13.810
Yes... yes, they will.

19:18.900 --> 19:23.019
You're asking a lot of your
operations manager, Agent Hanna.

19:23.021 --> 19:26.156
No, I'm asking
a lot of my friend.

19:26.158 --> 19:29.242
We just need you to buy us
a little more time.

19:29.244 --> 19:31.494
We're going to talk
to Arkady again.

19:39.253 --> 19:42.038
Are they meeting
with Snyder?

19:42.873 --> 19:44.925
Yes, imminently.

19:44.927 --> 19:48.378
We've got a nuclear bomb loose
inside our borders, Hetty.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.713
What the hell is going on?

19:54.185 --> 19:56.186
Thanks.

19:56.188 --> 19:59.155
So what exactly
are you looking for now?

19:59.157 --> 20:00.890
Somebody who would want
to kill Sidorov.

20:00.892 --> 20:02.025
We need an enemy.

20:02.027 --> 20:04.577
Not a lot of people
crazy enough to do that.

20:04.579 --> 20:06.112
He had to have crossed somebody.

20:06.114 --> 20:07.113
Okay.

20:07.115 --> 20:10.834
Okay, one man-- Andrei Kirkin.

20:10.836 --> 20:12.168
He controls

20:12.170 --> 20:15.705
heroin trade for all
of Western Russia.

20:15.707 --> 20:18.425
He has large,
powerful organization,

20:18.427 --> 20:21.861
and Sidorov killed his brother.

20:21.863 --> 20:23.680
Bingo.

20:23.682 --> 20:26.466
Who would Kirkin use
for a hit in the U.S.?

20:26.468 --> 20:30.353
Name is Varlamov--
Victor Varlamov.

20:30.355 --> 20:33.273
He is professional
hit man who takes care

20:33.275 --> 20:36.309
of all of Kirkin's
dirty business.

20:36.311 --> 20:40.146
He's very good
and very prolific.

20:40.148 --> 20:42.032
He's here in Los Angeles.

20:42.034 --> 20:43.233
You know his address?

20:43.235 --> 20:44.868
I play poker with him.

20:44.870 --> 20:47.320
Don't judge.

20:47.322 --> 20:49.906
Morally corrupt people
are my business.

20:49.908 --> 20:52.208
Let's pick him up.
Yeah.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.051
Victor, out.

21:01.053 --> 21:02.618
What is this about?

21:02.620 --> 21:04.721
The murder of Yulia Paklima.

21:04.723 --> 21:08.308
Beautiful, 16, and dead.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.959
Your DNA
on a 7.62-caliber shell

21:09.961 --> 21:12.512
and a witness
that puts you at the scene.

21:12.514 --> 21:15.765
Life's over, Victor,
you're done.

21:15.767 --> 21:17.317
You ever want to see
blue skies again

21:17.319 --> 21:18.818
that's not trimmed
in razor wire,

21:18.820 --> 21:20.770
need you to roll over
like a Chihuahua.

21:20.772 --> 21:22.272
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:22.274 --> 21:23.639
Let's jog his memory.

21:28.145 --> 21:32.749
This is the apartment building
where Yulia Paklima lived.

21:32.751 --> 21:35.118
You murdered her right
here on the roof.

21:35.120 --> 21:38.288
I'm telling you,
I don't know her.

21:38.290 --> 21:39.706
You know this guy?

21:39.708 --> 21:41.925
Don't even try
to say no.

21:41.927 --> 21:43.993
Andrei Kirkin,
your employer.

21:43.995 --> 21:46.162
Yeah, Andrei was
sleeping with Yulia.

21:46.164 --> 21:48.664
Was all fun and
underage games until...

21:48.666 --> 21:49.832
Somebody gets pregnant.

21:49.834 --> 21:50.934
I'm being set up.

21:50.936 --> 21:52.018
Andrei doesn't want
the complication,

21:52.020 --> 21:53.470
he hires you to kill her.

21:53.472 --> 21:55.105
Going to need you
to testify against him.

21:55.107 --> 21:56.506
Or if you really
love your boss,

21:56.508 --> 21:58.475
you can just take the
fall for the whole thing.

22:00.978 --> 22:02.278
You all right?

22:02.280 --> 22:04.030
I may...

22:04.032 --> 22:05.565
need to get to the hospital.

22:05.567 --> 22:06.566
What?

22:08.320 --> 22:10.286
Hey!

22:10.288 --> 22:11.988
Hey, stop!

22:12.856 --> 22:15.792
Think it's the burritos
coming up on me.

22:15.794 --> 22:17.627
Very nice.

22:18.412 --> 22:20.747
Yeah. Oh, my
gosh. I know.

22:20.749 --> 22:22.632
J.Lo looked <i>so</i> in love.

22:22.634 --> 22:24.067
I really thought it was

22:24.069 --> 22:25.468
gonna last this time.

22:25.470 --> 22:26.219
Get it?

22:26.221 --> 22:28.671
Kodak moment.

22:30.174 --> 22:32.058
Oh!

22:32.060 --> 22:33.510
That looked like it hurt.

22:33.512 --> 22:36.646
Did it hurt? Or did it
just look like it hurt?

22:36.648 --> 22:37.847
It hurt!

22:37.849 --> 22:39.715
I think I broke my finger.

22:39.717 --> 22:40.934
Well, hopefully
it's your trigger finger.

22:40.936 --> 22:42.385
Maybe you can stop
shooting at people.

22:42.387 --> 22:43.653
Come here.

22:45.689 --> 22:47.157
All good?

22:47.159 --> 22:48.241
Not really.

23:06.277 --> 23:08.662
Put Victor in the car.

23:13.568 --> 23:16.787
Let's take a walk,
Agent Hanna.

23:24.629 --> 23:25.846
What did Hetty tell you?

23:25.848 --> 23:28.048
Everything.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.351
If this is a...

23:31.353 --> 23:35.021
"you're a good agent but I have
to fire you" speech, do it.

23:35.023 --> 23:36.273
I'm busy.

23:36.275 --> 23:39.142
I can't have agents
telling me lies of omission.

23:39.144 --> 23:41.228
It's nothing you haven't done.

23:43.481 --> 23:46.450
I'm your boss, Agent Hanna,
whether you like it or not.

23:46.452 --> 23:49.536
If you needed to know,
you would have been informed.

23:49.538 --> 23:51.071
What do you want?

23:51.073 --> 23:53.940
I want you to know...

23:53.942 --> 23:56.243
that I've got your back.

23:57.412 --> 23:59.779
I understand.

23:59.781 --> 24:01.965
Everything.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.970
Hetty's going down the line
for you and so am I.

24:09.140 --> 24:12.142
Now, I don't know how long
we're gonna hold the CIA off,

24:12.144 --> 24:14.261
so we need to get
this thing set up

24:14.263 --> 24:15.479
quickly.

24:15.481 --> 24:16.963
Snyder's not gonna
be passive.

24:20.935 --> 24:22.936
Thank you.

24:22.938 --> 24:25.071
Yeah.

24:30.111 --> 24:32.279
- We're on.
- Come on.

24:32.281 --> 24:33.997
Clock's ticking.
We got to move.

24:35.283 --> 24:36.950
Quinn's ready?

24:40.821 --> 24:43.823
Let me show you what we've got.

24:46.127 --> 24:48.929
Why do I feel like I'm missing
a huge part of this?

24:48.931 --> 24:49.880
'Cause you are.

24:49.882 --> 24:51.264
And who's Quinn?

24:52.016 --> 24:54.718
Quinn is what
this is all about.

25:14.372 --> 25:16.456
Guys, a call

25:16.458 --> 25:17.958
just came from Sidorov's room.

25:17.960 --> 25:20.193
He's called for his car.
He's moving.

25:31.589 --> 25:33.974
I have eyes on Sidorov.
He's coming out.

25:33.976 --> 25:36.109
Deeks, go.

25:41.182 --> 25:44.017
Deeks, does the room key work?

25:44.019 --> 25:46.753
All good.

25:58.699 --> 26:00.550
You receiving that?

26:00.552 --> 26:01.835
No.

26:01.837 --> 26:03.036
Use the backup.

26:03.038 --> 26:04.871
Going to backup.

26:20.388 --> 26:22.556
Deeks, Sidorov's going
back to the room. Get out.

26:23.808 --> 26:25.642
Deeks.
I'm trying.

26:26.294 --> 26:27.394
Callen. Kensi.

26:27.396 --> 26:29.195
Two guys heading your way.

26:29.197 --> 26:30.113
How about now?

26:30.115 --> 26:31.865
It's good. Get out.

26:39.740 --> 26:42.008
Did you hear that?
Yeah, I heard three shots.

26:43.544 --> 26:45.579
Excuse me.

26:46.447 --> 26:49.082
Oh, my gosh,
I'm so scared.

26:49.917 --> 26:51.952
Deeks, you out?

26:51.954 --> 26:54.304
Almost.

27:01.012 --> 27:03.296
How you doing?

27:06.350 --> 27:07.851
Good talk.

27:07.853 --> 27:10.904
I'm on the eighth floor.
My name is Reese Samuels.

27:10.906 --> 27:12.606
Are the police
on their way?

27:12.608 --> 27:15.575
No, I'm telling you. I saw a man
coming down from the rooftop

27:15.577 --> 27:17.644
and he ran right
past me. Yes!

27:17.646 --> 27:18.695
Excuse me.

27:18.697 --> 27:21.081
You say you see man
come down from roof?

27:21.083 --> 27:22.449
I didn't just see him--

27:22.451 --> 27:24.284
I videotaped him on my phone.

27:24.286 --> 27:25.452
Really?

27:25.454 --> 27:26.703
I take a look?

27:26.705 --> 27:29.839
Yeah, I think I hear
the sirens. Thank you.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.043
I'm telling you,

27:33.045 --> 27:34.628
that's the guy.
Hey. Hey!

27:34.630 --> 27:35.795
Give me my phone back.

27:35.797 --> 27:38.014
Hey! Give me my
phone back! Wha...

27:38.016 --> 27:40.216
Jerk!

27:44.939 --> 27:47.374
Can you play it
from the top?

27:52.948 --> 27:54.197
What's he saying?

27:54.199 --> 27:57.651
They're saying they couldn't
find the shooter.

27:57.653 --> 28:00.687
Sidorov's so mad at his own guys
he wants to kill 'em.

28:00.689 --> 28:02.339
Well, that's the guy
that took my phone.

28:02.341 --> 28:06.543
Good. Sidorov says
he knows Victor Varlamov.

28:06.545 --> 28:09.095
And he knows he works
for Kirkin.

28:12.367 --> 28:14.534
He says he wants
to change hotels.

28:14.536 --> 28:17.654
They're telling him
that he's safe.

28:21.142 --> 28:23.009
Sidorov says he doesn't
want protection.

28:23.011 --> 28:25.712
He wants Kirkin dead.

28:25.714 --> 28:27.564
He wants his lieutenant

28:27.566 --> 28:29.616
to contract a hit man
for the job.

28:29.618 --> 28:30.900
Good.

28:30.902 --> 28:32.652
You got the phone number
for his lieutenant?

28:32.654 --> 28:34.104
I got it.

28:34.106 --> 28:35.905
Anybody he tries to contact,

28:35.907 --> 28:38.391
it's a disconnected number,
a dead e-mail account.

28:38.393 --> 28:39.275
He'll get back

28:39.277 --> 28:41.277
to Quinn fast.

28:41.279 --> 28:43.313
They kept in touch
over the years.

28:45.616 --> 28:47.667
Nell, how we doing?

28:47.669 --> 28:49.602
Just building an
entire life here.

28:49.604 --> 28:51.421
This has to
be rock solid.

28:51.423 --> 28:53.540
Believe me,
by the time I'm done,

28:53.542 --> 28:56.342
they'll have to dig to China
to know this isn't real.

28:57.211 --> 28:59.379
You okay?

29:01.682 --> 29:04.384
This is what I was afraid of.

29:18.065 --> 29:20.617
Got a prisoner coming out.

29:20.619 --> 29:22.769
Coming out on three.

29:34.548 --> 29:36.800
Lock it up.

30:21.915 --> 30:23.633
Are you okay?

30:24.968 --> 30:27.920
That was different.

30:28.755 --> 30:30.940
Yeah.

30:33.466 --> 30:36.518
It's been a long time since
making love was like that.

30:56.236 --> 30:59.405
I guess marriage changes things.

31:13.637 --> 31:16.306
Where's Quinn?

31:16.308 --> 31:20.259
You should have
returned my calls.

31:20.261 --> 31:23.098
Mister Sidorov
wishes to see you.

31:23.198 --> 31:26.032
The man has no patience.

31:26.034 --> 31:28.151
Let me get dressed.

31:28.153 --> 31:30.821
Probably he like it
if you didn't.

31:30.823 --> 31:32.706
If you want to live

31:32.708 --> 31:34.458
past the next five seconds,

31:34.460 --> 31:36.526
I'd get that gun
out of his face.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.095
Now.

31:41.549 --> 31:43.300
Thank you.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.469
I'll get dressed.

31:46.888 --> 31:49.172
And I won't even
take it personally.

31:50.258 --> 31:52.792
That's how nice of a guy I am.

32:00.067 --> 32:02.152
Isaak!

32:02.154 --> 32:04.938
Ah, good to see you.

32:08.142 --> 32:09.776
Mmm.

32:09.778 --> 32:12.329
People are never usually
this happy when they need

32:12.331 --> 32:13.447
my services.

32:13.449 --> 32:16.983
They don't like killing
as much as I do.

32:17.818 --> 32:19.753
You look beautiful.

32:19.755 --> 32:21.338
Why, thank you.

32:22.874 --> 32:25.709
This is David Forman.

32:25.711 --> 32:28.462
I know about him.

32:28.464 --> 32:31.798
L.A. Homicide detective
turned hit man.

32:31.800 --> 32:35.302
Just did 14 months
on a weapons charge

32:35.304 --> 32:37.771
because the D.A.
couldn't get you

32:37.773 --> 32:38.805
on the murder.

32:38.807 --> 32:40.357
I love Google.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.108
We're partners...

32:42.110 --> 32:43.977
and he's very good.

32:45.614 --> 32:48.782
Mr. and Mrs.
Black Smith.

32:50.068 --> 32:52.118
Come on, that's funny.

32:52.120 --> 32:54.070
What's the job?

32:54.072 --> 32:55.989
Somebody tried to kill me.

32:56.824 --> 32:59.960
Why does that not surprise me?

32:59.962 --> 33:02.462
Name's Kirkin.

33:02.464 --> 33:05.799
Andrei Kirkin?
You know him?

33:05.801 --> 33:08.902
Yeah. He's very well protected,

33:08.904 --> 33:10.587
and very dangerous.

33:10.589 --> 33:12.589
Not more than me.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.524
It's a big job, Isaak.

33:14.526 --> 33:17.143
That's why I need
my black wow.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.897
I've missed you.

33:26.270 --> 33:27.754
Look.

33:31.994 --> 33:34.444
$1 million cash.

33:51.429 --> 33:53.079
Now you're interested.

33:53.081 --> 33:55.348
Now it got real.

33:55.350 --> 33:57.801
Here's the thing.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.971
I don't see <i>him</i> again.

34:00.973 --> 34:03.607
Use him if you want
on the day, but...

34:03.609 --> 34:06.059
I don't like him.

34:06.061 --> 34:09.279
Come on.
What's not to like?

34:09.281 --> 34:11.598
That you're alive.

34:13.484 --> 34:16.603
I don't share my women.

34:19.106 --> 34:20.956
You want the job or not?

34:21.809 --> 34:23.743
I want it.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.780
Okay.

34:27.782 --> 34:30.266
I understand.

34:32.085 --> 34:34.054
Call me when you're done.

34:34.056 --> 34:36.306
I have an amazing white...

34:36.308 --> 34:37.674
burgundy.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.592
Let me pour you a glass.

35:01.315 --> 35:04.000
You haven't heard from her?

35:12.993 --> 35:16.012
Hetty. OPS.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.270
<i>Henrietta Lange?</i>

35:24.272 --> 35:25.572
Yes.

35:25.574 --> 35:27.140
It's not good.

35:27.142 --> 35:29.526
There were 11 sleepers--
three were couples,

35:29.528 --> 35:30.860
including Pierce and his wife.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.445
As you know, we found them all

35:32.447 --> 35:33.897
tortured and killed,
four of whom

35:33.899 --> 35:36.733
we believe were never in
possession of nuclear weapons.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.068
But two were.

35:38.070 --> 35:40.787
We believe so, yes.

35:40.789 --> 35:44.574
We found traces of radiation,
same as the one in San Diego.

35:44.576 --> 35:48.194
And you did not recover
the bombs?

35:48.196 --> 35:50.714
No. They're gone.

35:50.716 --> 35:53.333
So two, plus the one
Kensi and Deeks found.

35:53.335 --> 35:55.034
Now there's three
nuclear weapons out there.

35:55.036 --> 35:57.470
Sidorov will sell
those bombs to anybody.

35:57.472 --> 35:59.205
Al-Qaeda...

35:59.207 --> 36:02.058
domestic terrorists, anybody.

36:06.013 --> 36:07.514
Sam.

36:08.899 --> 36:13.186
LAPD found the body
of a woman in Santa Monica Bay.

36:13.188 --> 36:16.823
She had a parking ticket
from the Casa del Mar Hotel.

36:18.192 --> 36:21.111
Sidorov has
checked out.

36:21.113 --> 36:22.395
I'm sorry.

36:34.258 --> 36:36.543
♪

36:57.281 --> 37:00.266
Name's Anna Folasade.

37:00.268 --> 37:03.603
Sidorov was
traveling with her.

37:03.605 --> 37:05.038
Looks like an
accidental drowning.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.489
He probably
didn't want her

37:06.491 --> 37:09.159
cramping his style now that
Quinn's back in the picture.

37:09.161 --> 37:11.745
Is that Quinn,

37:11.747 --> 37:13.413
texting you to tell
you she's okay?

37:15.716 --> 37:18.218
He left on a diplomatic flight.

37:18.220 --> 37:19.552
We couldn't stop him.

37:19.554 --> 37:21.287
He's got three
nuclear weapons on him

37:21.289 --> 37:23.006
and you let him
leave the country?

37:23.008 --> 37:25.391
Oh, he's not gonna try to get
over the border with those.

37:25.393 --> 37:27.260
It's too hard.
He'll sell them right here.

37:27.262 --> 37:29.929
What makes you think
you'll ever see him again?

37:29.931 --> 37:31.648
He gave Quinn a quarter-
of-a-million-dollar advance.

37:31.650 --> 37:34.267
Said he was gonna set up
the hit for Los Angeles.

37:34.269 --> 37:36.903
He wouldn't have given her
that money for nothing.

37:36.905 --> 37:39.138
He <i>will</i> be back.

37:39.140 --> 37:41.441
And then...

37:41.443 --> 37:43.610
the fun starts.

37:47.114 --> 37:49.148
Hey, Sam.

37:49.150 --> 37:51.918
Thanks for setting it all up.

37:51.920 --> 37:54.704
Good to be working
together again.

38:00.010 --> 38:02.712
You put her
in a bad situation,

38:02.714 --> 38:04.848
I'll hunt the earth for you.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.850
Wow.

38:06.852 --> 38:08.334
Okay.

38:08.336 --> 38:11.855
A) It's Quinn's job
to be in a bad situation,

38:11.857 --> 38:13.940
and B) Go for it.

38:13.942 --> 38:15.108
Hey!

38:15.110 --> 38:17.110
Leave him alone!
Back off!

38:23.951 --> 38:25.485
No! Don't!

38:25.487 --> 38:26.402
Don't.

38:26.404 --> 38:27.237
Hey!

38:31.375 --> 38:35.228
Sam. Don't do it.

38:36.163 --> 38:37.797
Sam!

38:37.799 --> 38:39.465
He's not worth it.

39:00.571 --> 39:02.655
This is insane.

39:02.657 --> 39:04.557
What the hell
is going on?

39:04.559 --> 39:08.778
Hey, if this is a personal thing
between Sam and Quinn, just tell us.

39:10.080 --> 39:13.166
It wasn't supposed
to happen this way.

39:13.168 --> 39:16.703
Working on the same
task force, side by side,

39:16.705 --> 39:19.238
seven days a week,
months on end,

39:19.240 --> 39:21.758
they fell in love.

39:30.417 --> 39:32.936
Thank you, Mommy.

39:43.447 --> 39:46.115
We need to talk.

39:56.043 --> 39:57.994
You know, the world could end

39:57.996 --> 40:00.613
before I'd let something
happen to you.

40:05.469 --> 40:07.787
Don't worry.

40:11.292 --> 40:13.760
You're not gonna lose me.

40:24.855 --> 40:28.741
I thought this part was over
once we were married.

40:28.743 --> 40:30.693
We have no choice.

40:30.695 --> 40:32.478
We have to do this.

40:32.480 --> 40:37.417
Then you'll go back
to being Mrs. Sam Hanna?

40:49.013 --> 40:51.514
I don't know, baby.

40:54.351 --> 40:57.053
Being back at this
has made me realize

40:57.055 --> 40:59.389
this is who I am.

41:03.694 --> 41:06.145
I feel alive.

41:06.147 --> 41:09.449
A feel <i>alive</i> again.

41:21.211 --> 41:22.862
Now, let's take care

41:22.864 --> 41:25.048
of business first.

41:26.033 --> 41:28.868
We're gonna get
this bastard, right?

41:28.870 --> 41:30.803
Hell, yeah.
