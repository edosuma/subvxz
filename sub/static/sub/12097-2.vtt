01:30.156 --> 01:31.156
Wake up.

01:31.157 --> 01:32.157
Huh? Oh!

01:32.158 --> 01:33.158
Shh.

01:33.159 --> 01:35.160
Aah!

01:35.161 --> 01:37.162
Get up, Tate.
We're ready.

01:37.163 --> 01:38.163
Ready for what?

01:38.164 --> 01:39.665
The escape.

01:39.666 --> 01:41.667
We're escaping n...

01:41.668 --> 01:42.668
Shut up!

01:42.669 --> 01:44.169
It's night time,

01:44.170 --> 01:45.170
for God's sake.

01:45.171 --> 01:47.673
What do you want to do,
escape in broad daylight?

01:47.674 --> 01:48.674
You moron.

01:48.675 --> 01:53.679
Well, at least we could see.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.761
Have a little dinner first.

02:04.691 --> 02:05.691
Listen, Tate,

02:05.692 --> 02:08.193
I want you to attract
the guard's attention.

02:08.193 --> 02:09.695
How?
Scream.

02:15.201 --> 02:16.702
I can't scream.

02:16.703 --> 02:18.203
Scream, Tate!

02:18.204 --> 02:20.205
No, I can't. Really, really.

02:20.206 --> 02:24.209
No sound comes out.
My mouth opens and nothing.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.211
I'm a... a silent screamer.

02:26.212 --> 02:27.713
Watch.

02:30.216 --> 02:31.717
See? Nothing.

02:35.722 --> 02:37.723
All right, what's going on?

02:37.724 --> 02:39.225
Get the keys, Tate!

02:44.731 --> 02:46.231
Hey, Danny?
Yeah?

02:46.232 --> 02:47.733
Hey, Danny, your mother's
got our bathroom

02:47.734 --> 02:49.234
all tied up in her crying.

02:49.235 --> 02:50.736
Can I use yours?

02:50.737 --> 02:51.737
Yeah, sure,
but what's the matter?

02:51.738 --> 02:53.739
Why is she crying?
Why is she crying?

02:53.740 --> 02:54.740
Danny, you're getting married.

02:54.741 --> 02:55.741
She's been crying
since last night.

02:55.742 --> 02:58.243
She's crying because
I'm getting married?

02:58.244 --> 02:59.745
Well, last night she was crying

02:59.746 --> 03:00.746
because you're getting married.

03:00.747 --> 03:01.747
Tonight she's crying

03:01.748 --> 03:02.748
because her eyes look so bad

03:02.749 --> 03:04.750
from last night's crying.

03:04.751 --> 03:06.752
I don't know, we're all
a little excited and upset.

03:06.753 --> 03:07.753
Look at me...

03:07.754 --> 03:09.255
I got dressed, forgot to shave.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.768
I love the commercials
for this razor, huh?

03:22.769 --> 03:25.771
Two swipes, a guy
has shaved his entire face.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.773
Of course, the man's a eunuch.

03:27.774 --> 03:31.777
You know,
I've been thinking, Danny.

03:31.778 --> 03:32.778
Danny, I've been thinking,

03:32.779 --> 03:34.279
you know,
I'm not going to work forever,

03:34.280 --> 03:35.781
I mean, you know,

03:35.782 --> 03:37.282
I'm gonna retire someday,

03:37.283 --> 03:38.784
and I don't want to sell
my business.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.786
I want to be able to pass it on,

03:40.787 --> 03:43.288
so, uh, I don't know,
I've been thinking...

03:43.289 --> 03:45.791
how about we become partners?

03:45.792 --> 03:48.293
Partners?
Yeah.

03:48.294 --> 03:49.294
You and me?
Yeah.

03:49.295 --> 03:52.798
Gee, Burt, that's wonderful.

03:52.799 --> 03:55.801
I mean, what a surprise.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.302
Only thing is, right now,

03:57.303 --> 03:58.804
I'm afraid I can't
see my way clear.

03:58.805 --> 04:01.306
You can't see your way clear?

04:01.307 --> 04:02.808
Yeah, you see,

04:02.809 --> 04:04.810
uh, I have a couple of
interesting prospects

04:04.811 --> 04:05.811
of my own.

04:05.812 --> 04:08.815
I'm thinking of
becoming a banker.

04:10.817 --> 04:11.817
A banker?

04:11.818 --> 04:13.318
Yeah.

04:13.319 --> 04:14.820
Come on, Danny,
what are you talking about?

04:14.821 --> 04:17.822
You just don't go out
and be a banker.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.324
Of course you can.

04:19.325 --> 04:20.325
You rent a place...

04:20.326 --> 04:21.827
You hire a few tellers...

04:21.827 --> 04:23.328
you put up
a sign that says "bank",

04:23.329 --> 04:25.831
and the people come by
and drop off their dough.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.834
Danny, first of all,

04:28.835 --> 04:30.335
the government
controls the banks,

04:30.336 --> 04:31.336
and secondly,

04:31.337 --> 04:34.840
you need a lot of money
to open a bank.

04:34.841 --> 04:35.842
I could borrow some.

04:37.844 --> 04:39.344
You're going to go to a bank

04:39.345 --> 04:40.846
to borrow money to open a bank?

04:44.350 --> 04:45.351
No good, huh?

04:50.356 --> 04:52.358
Well, I have another
very interesting idea.

04:59.866 --> 05:01.366
Opening up a supermarket.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.368
Opening up a supermarket?

05:03.369 --> 05:04.369
Yeah.

05:04.370 --> 05:05.871
No good?

05:10.295 --> 05:11.376
I have a very exciting idea

05:11.377 --> 05:12.878
that could revolutionize travel.

05:12.879 --> 05:13.879
Revolutionize travel?

05:13.880 --> 05:14.880
Yeah.

05:14.881 --> 05:17.382
I'm in this department store
yesterday, right?

05:17.383 --> 05:19.384
And they take my money
and put it in a tube,

05:19.385 --> 05:21.386
and then they put
the tube in a chute

05:21.387 --> 05:22.387
and... thwack!

05:22.388 --> 05:24.890
Back it comes with my change.

05:24.891 --> 05:25.891
So?

05:25.892 --> 05:26.892
So?

05:26.893 --> 05:28.393
So, I'm thinking,

05:28.394 --> 05:29.895
what about a tube like that,

05:29.896 --> 05:31.396
but bigger,

05:31.397 --> 05:34.399
carrying passengers
from New York to LA?

05:34.400 --> 05:35.901
Thuh-wack!

05:38.404 --> 05:39.905
Be there in seconds.

05:44.410 --> 05:46.411
Listen, Danny, Danny, Danny.

05:46.412 --> 05:47.412
Please, you've got to grow up.

05:47.413 --> 05:48.914
I mean, what do you know?

05:48.915 --> 05:51.416
Your entire experience
is driving a car for the mob,

05:51.417 --> 05:53.418
and suddenly, you've got
all these kind of fancy ideas.

05:53.419 --> 05:55.420
You know how to
parallel park, Danny.

05:55.421 --> 05:56.422
That's it.

05:58.925 --> 06:00.926
Danny, I'm offering you
a partnership here,

06:00.927 --> 06:02.427
to be my partner.

06:02.428 --> 06:03.929
Your partner, huh?

06:03.930 --> 06:05.931
Hey, I admit it's not a bank,

06:05.932 --> 06:06.932
but it's a start.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.935
Campbell and Stepson.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.938
No, Danny, you don't say
"Campbell and Stepson,"

06:12.939 --> 06:13.939
you say
"Campbell and Son."

06:13.940 --> 06:14.940
Okay.

06:14.941 --> 06:17.442
Huh? We're partners?

06:17.443 --> 06:18.443
Partners.

06:18.444 --> 06:19.945
There you go. Hey.
Hey!

06:23.449 --> 06:24.950
No good, huh?

06:24.951 --> 06:26.953
No... No.

06:49.976 --> 06:51.977
You making those knots
secure, Tate?

06:51.978 --> 06:54.980
Oh, yes, yes.
I make wonderful knots.

06:54.981 --> 06:55.981
That's good,

06:55.982 --> 06:57.482
because you're gonna test it.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.985
No, no, no, no.

06:59.986 --> 07:01.987
Come on.

07:01.988 --> 07:02.989
Ow.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.502
Oh, my God...

07:18.504 --> 07:20.505
Tate, are you all right?

07:20.506 --> 07:22.508
Wonderful.

07:34.020 --> 07:36.521
This is supposed to be
the happiest day of my life.

07:36.522 --> 07:37.522
I know.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.024
It's not.
I know.

07:39.025 --> 07:40.025
It's the worst.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.526
There.

07:41.527 --> 07:44.029
I always thought
I'd be nervous, but happy.

07:44.030 --> 07:46.532
I always thought
I'd be happy, but sad.

07:48.034 --> 07:50.035
I'm just miserable.

07:50.036 --> 07:51.536
So am I.

07:51.537 --> 07:53.538
I always thought
I'd love the girl I married.

07:53.539 --> 07:55.540
I always thought
the girl you'd marry

07:55.541 --> 07:56.541
to be a little like me,

07:56.542 --> 07:58.543
but Elaine is...

07:58.544 --> 08:00.045
I don't know.

08:00.046 --> 08:01.547
She's a pig.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.554
Danny.

08:09.555 --> 08:12.057
That is a terrible thing to say.

08:12.058 --> 08:14.560
It's awful.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.566
Yeah, but it's true.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.568
She is.

08:23.569 --> 08:24.570
She's a pig!

08:26.572 --> 08:28.073
She is not a pig.

08:28.074 --> 08:30.076
Don't say that.
Don't say that.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.078
She's the girl
you're going to marry.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.081
You can't call her a pig...

08:37.082 --> 08:39.585
Even if she is one.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.091
Mr. and Mrs. Burt Campbell

08:46.092 --> 08:47.592
are happy to announce

08:47.593 --> 08:49.594
the marriage
of their son Danny...

08:49.595 --> 08:51.597
to a pig.

09:05.111 --> 09:08.114
What are we laughing at?

09:11.117 --> 09:13.118
How terrible it is

09:13.119 --> 09:14.619
that Danny has to marry a girl

09:14.620 --> 09:16.121
he hates.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.124
Sooie! Sooie!

09:21.627 --> 09:23.128
Hey, Burt...

09:32.138 --> 09:34.139
So what's the big joke?

09:34.140 --> 09:37.642
You are, dear.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.644
Get your flaky sister
out of here, please,

09:39.645 --> 09:41.646
and for God's sake, get dressed.

09:41.647 --> 09:43.148
The ceremony's gonna start.

09:43.149 --> 09:46.151
I am dressed.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.152
You're wearing that?

09:47.153 --> 09:49.654
Come on.

09:49.655 --> 09:51.156
Now, wait a minute.

09:51.157 --> 09:52.657
You're not supposed
to see the groom

09:52.658 --> 09:54.159
before the wedding.
It's bad luck.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.160
And this marriage has got enough

09:55.161 --> 09:58.163
going against it already.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.665
Come on, dear,
let's wait outside.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.167
You.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.168
You'd better move it.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.170
The Rabbi says
he's gotta leave in 10 minutes.

10:05.171 --> 10:07.172
He's got a bar mitzvah,
two funerals, a bris,

10:07.173 --> 10:09.674
and tickets to <i>Pippin.</i>

10:09.675 --> 10:10.675
Come on, dear.

10:10.676 --> 10:13.178
They'll be along
in just a moment.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.180
Oh, you do look lovely.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.682
You know, no one would guess

10:17.683 --> 10:19.685
you're trash.

10:23.189 --> 10:26.191
Listen, uh...

10:26.192 --> 10:28.693
what were we laughing about?

10:28.694 --> 10:31.196
I'll tell you later.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.697
Oh, yeah. Sure.

10:32.698 --> 10:34.199
I'll go.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.708
Well, one thing doesn't change,

10:43.709 --> 10:45.710
no matter who you marry.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.713
You're moving out.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.715
I'm losing my baby.

10:50.716 --> 10:52.217
You're not losing me, Ma.

10:52.218 --> 10:54.220
I am. I am. I am.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.722
You'll have your own home,

10:57.723 --> 10:59.224
your own family,

10:59.225 --> 11:01.227
your own refrigerator...

11:02.728 --> 11:04.229
You'll never call.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.231
Don't be silly.
Of course I'll call.

11:06.232 --> 11:07.732
When?

11:07.733 --> 11:09.234
What do you mean, "when"?
I'll call every day.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.735
You will?
Of course I will.

11:10.736 --> 11:12.237
And you'll come to dinner?

11:12.238 --> 11:13.239
Sure.
Every night?

11:14.740 --> 11:15.741
Oh, Ma.

11:17.243 --> 11:19.244
Mrs. Gorney's son
got married

11:19.245 --> 11:21.246
and moved to California.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.749
She hears from him once a year
at Christmas.

11:25.751 --> 11:28.753
He sends her a card
with a picture of his Mercedes.

11:28.754 --> 11:30.755
That's it.

11:30.756 --> 11:34.259
And Mrs. Kadish, poor soul...

11:34.260 --> 11:38.263
her son got married
and moved away.

11:38.264 --> 11:40.766
She's hasn't taken a bath
in two years.

11:42.768 --> 11:47.272
She's afraid he'll call,
she'll be in the tub.

11:51.277 --> 11:54.779
Come on, Ma.
That'll never happen.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.781
Oh, I know I sound very silly
to you.

11:56.782 --> 11:58.783
But someday,
when you have children,

11:58.784 --> 12:00.285
you'll understand

12:00.286 --> 12:02.787
that you say goodbye
to a bit of your life

12:02.788 --> 12:06.291
when you say goodbye
to your child.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.794
But it's not goodbye, Ma.

12:09.795 --> 12:12.297
I'll see you.

12:12.298 --> 12:15.800
Yes, of course you will.

12:15.801 --> 12:18.303
We'd better go.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.305
There are 400 Swedish meatballs

12:20.306 --> 12:21.807
getting cold out there.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.310
I love you, Ma.

12:26.812 --> 12:28.814
And I love you, Danny.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.836
Oh, perhaps you know,
Mr. Lefkowitz.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.338
Could you tell me

12:53.339 --> 12:56.341
why Jewish sculptors
work in chopped liver

12:56.342 --> 12:57.843
instead of marble?

12:59.345 --> 13:00.845
So, what about you?

13:00.846 --> 13:02.847
Did you make up your mind yet?

13:02.848 --> 13:03.848
About what, Burt?

13:03.849 --> 13:04.849
"About what, Burt?"

13:04.850 --> 13:06.851
You're living with a girl
and dating a boy,

13:06.852 --> 13:08.892
so which one's your girlfriend,
the boy or the girl?

13:10.196 --> 13:12.357
Because if it's the girl,
her father gives the wedding,

13:12.358 --> 13:14.359
and if it's the boy, just
because he's a football boy,

13:14.360 --> 13:16.361
don't think you're the bride
and I'm giving the wedding,

13:16.362 --> 13:17.863
because forget about it.
I'm not.

13:19.865 --> 13:21.866
Hey, Elaine,

13:21.867 --> 13:24.869
these are my cousins,
Corinne and Eunice.

13:24.870 --> 13:25.870
So?

13:30.376 --> 13:34.379
Charlie, a black man you invite?

13:34.380 --> 13:36.881
A <i>schwartze?</i>

13:36.882 --> 13:39.884
It's their side of the family.

13:39.885 --> 13:41.386
Their side?

13:41.387 --> 13:43.888
A black man?

13:43.889 --> 13:45.890
A blood relative?

13:45.891 --> 13:47.892
Nah, you're kidding.

13:47.893 --> 13:49.895
The man's a <i>schwa...</i>

13:54.400 --> 13:56.402
<i>Schwartze.</i>

14:01.407 --> 14:03.408
Uh, Benson, I'm sorry.

14:03.409 --> 14:04.909
I really hope
you're not offended.

14:04.910 --> 14:05.910
Listen, you're the one

14:05.911 --> 14:07.412
who's marrying into this family.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.915
If you're happy,
I'm tickled pink.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.421
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to make a toast.

14:16.922 --> 14:19.924
This is an occasion
I've looked forward to

14:19.925 --> 14:21.426
for a very long time,

14:21.427 --> 14:23.928
the marriage of my daughter.

14:23.929 --> 14:26.431
When my wife died,
I promised her on her deathbed

14:26.432 --> 14:29.434
I would take care of Elaine
till the day she married,

14:29.435 --> 14:31.936
that she would never want
for anything.

14:31.937 --> 14:34.439
I've kept that promise.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.942
And so, I hand my daughter over
to a fine young man

14:37.943 --> 14:40.945
who, from now on,
will take care of her,

14:40.946 --> 14:43.448
because
I'm completely cutting her off.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.452
She'll never get another penny
or hear another word from me

14:47.453 --> 14:48.953
as long as I live,

14:48.954 --> 14:51.456
because
she is a disgusting person

14:51.457 --> 14:53.958
and nothing thrills me more
than to be rid of her forever.

14:53.959 --> 14:54.960
<i>Le'chaim.</i>

15:08.974 --> 15:12.977
This is high.
How do we get down?

15:12.978 --> 15:13.978
We jump.

15:13.979 --> 15:14.979
Wha... Forget it.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.981
Go ahead and jump, Tate.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.983
Please... After you.

15:18.984 --> 15:21.486
Okay.

15:21.487 --> 15:22.987
Uhh!

15:22.988 --> 15:23.988
Don't get up.

15:23.989 --> 15:24.989
Why?

15:24.990 --> 15:27.492
I need something soft
to land on.

15:28.494 --> 15:29.995
Oof!

15:31.497 --> 15:32.997
I'm telling you
the truth, Dennis.

15:32.998 --> 15:37.001
Elaine's father
cut them off completely.

15:37.002 --> 15:39.003
And now they have to go
live with my parents

15:39.004 --> 15:40.004
because Danny
doesn't have a dime. I...

15:43.008 --> 15:44.008
Hi.

15:44.009 --> 15:46.010
Hi.

15:46.011 --> 15:47.512
What are you doing up so late?

15:47.513 --> 15:49.514
Waiting for you.

15:49.515 --> 15:51.516
Uh, well, maybe
I should go, huh?

15:51.517 --> 15:53.017
Don't go.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.018
Go.

15:54.019 --> 15:56.021
Carol...

15:57.022 --> 15:58.022
That's all right.

15:58.023 --> 15:59.023
I could use

15:59.024 --> 16:00.525
a good night's sleep anyway.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.527
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.030
Good night, Carol.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.535
I've had it with you, Carol!

16:10.536 --> 16:13.037
I can't live like this anymore.

16:13.038 --> 16:14.539
I'm moving out.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.040
Now, listen,
I'll pay half the rent

16:16.041 --> 16:18.543
until you're able
to get yourself to...

16:18.544 --> 16:20.545
Don't do that, Carol.

16:26.051 --> 16:27.051
What?

16:36.061 --> 16:38.062
All right, Carol.
All right.

16:38.063 --> 16:39.063
Carol, okay.

16:39.064 --> 16:41.065
We'll give it another few weeks.

16:41.066 --> 16:42.567
But you've got to understand

16:42.568 --> 16:44.569
that we each have our own lives.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.070
No.

16:46.071 --> 16:48.072
"No," you don't understand,

16:48.073 --> 16:49.574
or "no,"
we don't have our own lives?

16:53.078 --> 16:55.080
Would you talk to me?

16:56.582 --> 16:58.082
Things have changed.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.083
What things?

16:59.084 --> 17:00.585
Things.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.588
Could you be more specific?

17:06.090 --> 17:08.593
I... I'm gonna
have your baby.

17:10.596 --> 17:12.096
What?

17:12.097 --> 17:14.598
I'm...
gonna... have...

17:14.599 --> 17:16.602
your... baby.

17:26.612 --> 17:29.113
You're pregnant?

17:29.114 --> 17:30.114
Up until now,

17:30.115 --> 17:32.617
that's how
you usually had babies.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.121
Y-you're sure?

17:37.623 --> 17:39.625
The rabbit died.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.631
Uh, Carol?
Uh...

17:46.632 --> 17:50.134
Carol, uh, how do you know

17:50.135 --> 17:51.636
that it's, uh...

17:51.637 --> 17:53.137
I mean, how can you
be sure that it...

17:53.138 --> 17:55.139
It's yours.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.641
How can you be sure?

17:56.642 --> 17:58.643
Jodie, you were the only one.

17:58.644 --> 18:00.645
But it was only once.

18:00.646 --> 18:02.147
That'll do it.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.151
A baby?

18:07.152 --> 18:08.653
Yes.

18:10.155 --> 18:11.155
A baby.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.657
Right.

18:12.658 --> 18:14.158
You went to the doctor?

18:14.159 --> 18:15.159
Yes.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.160
Well, what did he say?

18:16.161 --> 18:17.161
"You're pregnant."

18:17.162 --> 18:18.663
Besides that.

18:18.664 --> 18:20.665
I mean...

18:20.666 --> 18:22.166
Carol,

18:22.167 --> 18:23.668
are you okay?

18:23.669 --> 18:26.671
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.173
Healthy as a horse.

18:29.174 --> 18:33.177
A fine, healthy... mother-to-be.

18:33.178 --> 18:34.178
Right.

18:34.179 --> 18:36.180
Well, the father-to-be

18:36.181 --> 18:38.683
is not your standard model here.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.687
I mean, considering
he's in love with a man

18:42.688 --> 18:44.188
and, up until a few months ago,

18:44.189 --> 18:45.690
was wearing
his mother's clothes,

18:45.691 --> 18:47.192
but, hey, that okay.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.698
Oh, Jodie.

18:53.699 --> 18:54.699
Maybe they made a mistake.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.701
I mean,
doctors can make mistakes.

18:56.702 --> 18:58.703
If you're not
an investment banker,

18:58.704 --> 19:00.204
sometimes
they don't pay attention.

19:00.205 --> 19:01.706
It isn't a mistake.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.711
I see.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.715
Uh...

19:10.716 --> 19:12.718
Um...

19:15.220 --> 19:16.721
Wh-what you want to do?

19:19.224 --> 19:21.226
I'm gonna have the baby.

19:23.228 --> 19:24.309
You're gonna have the baby?

19:29.735 --> 19:31.737
She's gonna have a baby.

19:40.245 --> 19:41.245
Be calm?

19:41.246 --> 19:42.747
How can I be calm

19:42.748 --> 19:43.748
when, right after
your husband escapes,

19:43.749 --> 19:45.249
several other criminals
go right out

19:45.250 --> 19:47.251
through the same bars
that they cut, and escape too?

19:47.252 --> 19:48.753
And several of them
were killers.

19:48.754 --> 19:50.254
But don't you worry,

19:50.255 --> 19:51.756
we're gonna catch all of them.

19:51.757 --> 19:52.757
Well, most of them...

19:52.758 --> 19:54.258
well, just some of them.

19:54.259 --> 19:55.259
Oh, I don't know.

19:56.261 --> 19:59.764
I can't believe that
Dad's an escaped prisoner.

19:59.765 --> 20:02.266
We must shoot
escaping prisoners!

20:02.267 --> 20:04.268
Set an example!

20:04.269 --> 20:08.272
I know this is bending
the Geneva Con slightly,

20:08.273 --> 20:09.774
but so what?

20:11.777 --> 20:15.279
Where is Benson?
It's time for our dessert.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.280
He's down in the basement, Mom.

20:16.281 --> 20:17.281
Oh, darling, would you go down

20:17.282 --> 20:18.282
and get him?

20:18.283 --> 20:19.283
All right.

20:19.284 --> 20:21.285
I hate the basement.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.287
It gives me the creeps.

20:23.288 --> 20:25.289
The basement doesn't
bother me a bit.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.791
It's the attic I hate.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.293
I don't like the ocean.

20:31.296 --> 20:33.298
The ocean always scares me.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.802
I wonder where Daddy's gonna go.

20:37.803 --> 20:40.805
Probably Mexico
or South America.

20:40.806 --> 20:42.807
Oh, I don't think so.

20:42.808 --> 20:45.309
Your father and I
went there once, on a cruise,

20:45.310 --> 20:47.812
and he never
got out of the bathroom.

20:49.815 --> 20:51.816
Well, what is keeping Billy?

20:51.817 --> 20:54.819
Corinne, please, go and see
where your brother is.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.822
Oh, only if Eunice
comes with me.

20:57.823 --> 20:59.825
Oh, honestly, Corinne...

21:01.326 --> 21:05.329
I once escaped from a POW camp.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.331
I dug a tunnel with a spoon

21:07.332 --> 21:10.334
and carried the dirt out
in my shorts.

21:10.335 --> 21:13.337
And after 10 months of digging,

21:13.338 --> 21:16.340
I finally made my escape
through the tunnel.

21:16.341 --> 21:18.843
Oh, it was a beautiful tunnel.

21:18.844 --> 21:22.847
There was only one thing
wrong with it, though.

21:22.848 --> 21:26.851
It came out
right in Hitler's dressing room.

21:26.852 --> 21:29.854
That's nice, Daddy.

21:29.855 --> 21:31.355
Eunice?

21:31.356 --> 21:33.357
Billy?
Children, come on now.

21:33.358 --> 21:35.360
I'm ready for my dessert.

21:36.862 --> 21:38.863
That's strange.

21:38.864 --> 21:41.366
I also ruined
my only pair of shorts.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.372
Hello?

21:49.374 --> 21:51.876
Yoo-hoo!

21:51.877 --> 21:53.879
Where is everybody?

21:58.884 --> 22:02.386
Is this a surprise party?

22:02.387 --> 22:05.890
Because if it is,
I'm not telling you my age.

22:08.393 --> 22:10.895
All right, now, come on...

22:10.896 --> 22:12.898
fun's fun,
but everybody come up.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.402
Hmm.

22:22.407 --> 22:23.408
Strange.

22:44.930 --> 22:47.432
All right.

22:48.934 --> 22:51.936
I'm coming down now...

22:51.937 --> 22:54.940
but, please,
don't anybody scare me.

23:01.446 --> 23:03.448
Billy?

23:05.951 --> 23:06.952
Eunice?

23:08.954 --> 23:10.955
Corinne?

23:22.968 --> 23:24.969
<i>Will Danny and Elaine</i>
<i>find happiness,</i>

23:24.970 --> 23:27.471
<i>even though he thinks</i>
<i>she's a farm animal?</i>

23:27.472 --> 23:28.472
<i>Will Burt and Mary</i>
<i>find happiness</i>

23:28.473 --> 23:31.475
<i>living with Danny</i>
<i>and the farm animal?</i>

23:31.476 --> 23:33.477
<i>Will Jodie</i>
<i>have to change his life</i>

23:33.478 --> 23:34.979
<i>once he's changing diapers?</i>

23:34.980 --> 23:37.982
<i>Will Sheriff Tinkler</i>
<i>find Chester, Dutch,</i>

23:37.983 --> 23:39.483
<i>and the other escaped criminals?</i>

23:39.484 --> 23:40.985
<i>And if he does find Chester,</i>

23:40.986 --> 23:43.487
<i>what kind of shape</i>
<i>will he be in?</i>

23:43.488 --> 23:46.490
<i>What's happened to Benson,</i>
<i>Billy, Eunice, and Corinne</i>

23:46.491 --> 23:47.992
<i>in the basement?</i>

23:47.993 --> 23:50.494
<i>And what's going to happen</i>
