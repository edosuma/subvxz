00:01.936 --> 00:03.002
(silence)

00:37.304 --> 00:40.372
(suspenseful music)

01:42.670 --> 01:45.170
(gasping)

01:45.172 --> 01:47.406
(sobbing)

03:06.420 --> 03:09.421
(thoughtful music)

03:27.841 --> 03:30.809
(knocking at door)

03:47.761 --> 03:50.596
(unsettling music)

03:50.598 --> 03:51.830
- [Girl] Yeah?

03:52.666 --> 03:53.832
(knocking at door)

03:53.834 --> 03:54.733
Yes?

03:54.735 --> 03:57.436
- Hi, I have a couple of parcels
for you.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.904
- Okay, thanks.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.406
- On the phone you specified
that you wanted small parcels

04:01.408 --> 04:03.675
so I tried to wrap
each item individually.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.509
Is that alright?

04:04.511 --> 04:05.744
- [Girl] Yeah.

04:08.983 --> 04:11.783
- And, what do you want
me to do with this?

04:11.785 --> 04:13.218
Should I just leave it by the
door or?

04:13.220 --> 04:14.286
- [Girl] No.

04:16.323 --> 04:18.457
Slide it through the window.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.125
It's on the way out.

04:20.127 --> 04:20.959
- Alright.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.327
Have a good one.
Freak.

04:47.054 --> 04:50.022
(unsettling music)

05:11.378 --> 05:12.678
- Way too cute.

05:14.748 --> 05:19.484
How about this one?

05:21.155 --> 05:23.422
That's just around the corner.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.325
Literally thirty seconds
from here.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.059
(alarm beeping)

06:34.061 --> 06:35.060
Yeah right.

06:36.330 --> 06:40.031
It's just an urban legend
you dickhead.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.800
What have you been smoking?

06:41.802 --> 06:43.602
(man laughing)

06:43.604 --> 06:45.137
(groans)

06:45.139 --> 06:47.506
Do you have to be
so fucking loud?

06:47.508 --> 06:48.907
For fuck's sake.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.814
Come on Parker where are you?

06:55.816 --> 06:59.885
You're the caretaker,
do your fucking job.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.119
There you are.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.457
So that's what you're
doing instead of working,

07:05.459 --> 07:07.392
hooking up with girls.

07:07.394 --> 07:12.030
You're not gonna do anything
to stop that fucking no...

07:13.467 --> 07:14.366
Wait.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.669
Someone's moving in.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.338
Wow.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.973
Welcome to nowhere.

07:23.677 --> 07:24.743
Genius move.

07:27.381 --> 07:30.348
(unsettling music)

07:43.864 --> 07:44.930
Who are you?

07:47.734 --> 07:50.068
I've never seen you before.

08:18.532 --> 08:19.431
Right.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.366
Nothing.

08:51.832 --> 08:56.968
Rumors, rumors, and more rumors.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.640
I knew it wasn't real.

09:01.642 --> 09:02.707
Case solved.

09:12.085 --> 09:15.086
(unsettling music)

09:34.675 --> 09:37.409
Death is one thing we guarantee.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.923
(muffled arguing outside)

10:30.030 --> 10:31.830
- Fuck you Alvarado.
- Piss off.

10:31.832 --> 10:35.400
- I'll get your for this, you
stupid fuck.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.012
- What is he doing?

10:49.783 --> 10:52.250
Oh my God, he's sleepwalking.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.287
(unsettling music)

11:55.716 --> 11:58.316
Okay, nicely done guys.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.884
Really convincing.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.555
I mean why don't you shoot
the next Blair Witch sequel

12:03.557 --> 12:05.223
while you're at it.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.916
God this is fucking sick.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.827
Seriously Parker.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.763
Wow.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.665
You really hit on her.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.435
How old is she, anyway?

13:27.507 --> 13:28.573
There he is.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.477
Hmm.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.380
He's done with the
moving in already.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.949
Where's that girl he was with?

13:40.220 --> 13:43.221
(thoughtful music)

13:53.500 --> 13:55.733
He's a MatchHunter member.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.436
No way, seriously?

13:59.539 --> 14:01.039
Shit.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.441
Oh I can't see his username.

14:04.811 --> 14:05.710
Fuck.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.152
Okay.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.555
Members near you, online.

14:20.727 --> 14:21.626
Got you.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.465
(sighs)

14:54.661 --> 14:55.860
- [TV Reporter] 20 year old
Susan Lynch

14:55.862 --> 14:57.629
has been reported missing

14:57.630 --> 14:59.397
after she failed to return
home on Wednesday evening.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.799
This is the 2nd disappearance
happening in the area

15:01.801 --> 15:04.235
since the abduction of
18 year old Amy Bradley,

15:04.237 --> 15:07.338
whose body was found in a
parking lot two months ago.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.474
Ms. Lynch was last seen
at her working place

15:09.476 --> 15:11.943
in a supermarket near
Old Street Station.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.212
Metropolitan police have
launched an investigation

15:14.214 --> 15:16.915
and are urging anyone who
possesses information about--

15:16.917 --> 15:19.067
- That's it, that's it.

15:19.068 --> 15:21.218
Come on, come on,
come on, read it.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.954
- [TV Weatherlady] After
a rather wet weekend,

15:22.956 --> 15:23.988
particularly in the southeast

15:23.990 --> 15:25.223
(computer beeping)
we will be attempting

15:25.225 --> 15:27.025
to dry slightly throughout
the week

15:27.027 --> 15:30.762
and 30% cloudy skies
on Thursday and Friday.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.464
Occasional cold winds will
continue to blow from the coast

15:33.466 --> 15:34.766
in the coming days.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.434
But they should
eventually ease down

15:36.436 --> 15:38.169
towards the end of the week.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.038
The weather will be dry
for the north,

15:40.040 --> 15:42.840
while local temperatures are
expected to drop again slightly

15:42.842 --> 15:44.575
towards the weekend.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.945
Seven counties will
continue to experience

15:46.947 --> 15:48.780
rather damp weather
throughout the week

15:48.782 --> 15:51.516
but the pattern is expected
to break by Wednesday evening.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.352
So far this season has
been rather unsettled,

15:54.354 --> 15:55.720
particularly in the south,

15:55.722 --> 15:57.689
but average weather
throughout the region

15:57.691 --> 16:00.558
should start to stabilize
towards the end of next week.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.794
This concludes our weather
report for this hour.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.729
Do stay tuned and
we'll be back shortly

16:04.731 --> 16:07.131
with the latest sports news.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.201
(computer beeps)

16:10.203 --> 16:12.237
- I work with kids

16:12.238 --> 16:14.272
with disabilities and
learning difficulties.

16:14.274 --> 16:17.742
I work crazy hours but it's
really rewarding and I love it,

16:17.744 --> 16:21.479
I just relocated to start
a new internship though,

16:21.481 --> 16:24.983
so I'm still adjusting to my
new team and my new place.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.919
We'll see how it goes.

16:28.955 --> 16:29.854
Um...

16:37.697 --> 16:40.565
(computer beeps)

16:40.567 --> 16:43.534
(thoughtful music)

16:49.142 --> 16:50.675
(computer beeps)

16:50.677 --> 16:51.509
No flatmates.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.844
I've grown out of them, ha!

16:54.080 --> 16:56.547
I'm all by my lonesome
without anyone to yell at me

16:56.549 --> 16:58.649
when I get home
after a long day of work.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.053
Solitary streaming binge,
here I come.

17:04.324 --> 17:08.860
Tell me about it.

17:08.862 --> 17:13.931
It can feel really
isolating in this city,

17:14.701 --> 17:15.867
but I hope...

17:25.178 --> 17:28.012
(computer beeps)

17:37.824 --> 17:41.959
(muffled rap music from outside)

18:26.873 --> 18:27.772
What is this?

18:29.542 --> 18:34.579
Nominate the next suicide.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.913
That's fucked up.

18:46.493 --> 18:49.460
Hey Tony, you mind keeping
the music down?

18:49.462 --> 18:51.462
Some of us are trying
to sleep up here.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.330
- What was that?

18:52.332 --> 18:53.631
- Excuse me?

18:53.633 --> 18:54.799
- I can't hear you.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.234
I can't hear you.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.502
Hey, hey guess what?

18:57.504 --> 18:59.103
- I'm calling the police.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.004
- I'm sorry now.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.475
(laughing)

19:05.678 --> 19:06.677
Oh what a shame.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.012
- Shit!

19:08.014 --> 19:09.013
- I'll tell you what.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.214
I'll tell you what guys.

19:10.216 --> 19:11.048
Here we go.

19:11.050 --> 19:13.584
(group laughing)

19:13.586 --> 19:15.653
Come on, do something
for the camera.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.487
- You know what?

19:16.489 --> 19:18.923
Fuck you, you stupid crack head.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.358
Just wait 'til one of you
idiots ODs

19:20.360 --> 19:23.628
and then we'll see who's
laughing then you stupid junkie.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.364
(ominous tones)

19:31.704 --> 19:32.603
Screw this.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.640
Real or not who gives a shit.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.609
Someone please give that
little prick a hint.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.716
(hip hop music)

19:53.960 --> 19:54.959
God this is endless

19:56.062 --> 19:57.461
who's posting these videos?

19:59.265 --> 20:01.999
And what even am I supposed
to do on this website?

20:02.001 --> 20:04.502
There's no links, no pages,
no nothing.

20:06.339 --> 20:09.207
Am I seriously just supposed
to sit here and watch them?

20:28.027 --> 20:29.760
Are you gonna let him
hit on you again?

20:31.998 --> 20:33.464
Seriously Parker, photos?

20:35.802 --> 20:37.969
She doesn't look like a model.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.540
(pensive music)

20:45.612 --> 20:48.446
(phone vibrates)

20:48.448 --> 20:49.347
Great.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.682
Too slow for internet.

21:02.528 --> 21:04.362
Based both in London
and New York,

21:04.364 --> 21:07.031
Gareth is currently shooting
some behind the scenes pictures

21:07.033 --> 21:08.899
for Jude Law's
upcoming sci-fi film.

21:13.106 --> 21:14.005
Really?

21:42.568 --> 21:45.369
(computer beeps)

21:55.014 --> 21:56.847
Hi Josh, sure, what's up?

22:05.925 --> 22:07.758
Come on, come on, come on,
come on.

22:11.631 --> 22:13.164
(computer beeps)

22:13.166 --> 22:15.666
Nothing too exciting, I'm
still adjusting to my new job

22:15.668 --> 22:17.868
while struggling with
some sleep issues.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.603
I recently became aware
of an existence

22:19.605 --> 22:21.672
of a noisy neighbor on my block.

22:21.674 --> 22:25.076
Belongs to a nocturnal species
of animals much to my dismay.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.580
(computer beeps)

22:29.582 --> 22:31.015
Tell me if I'm writing too fast.

22:31.017 --> 22:31.916
I usually do.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.452
By the way, I checked your
profile again

22:34.454 --> 22:36.420
and it seems
we live in the same area.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.357
For all we know,
we could be neighbors.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.494
Would you fancy meeting up?

22:43.496 --> 22:46.297
I'd love to make a few new
friends in my new neighborhood.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.710
Sure, that would be great.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.512
Although I'm quite busy
with work at the moment.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.581
Maybe we could try a call?

23:03.583 --> 23:04.882
It would be nice
to hear your voice.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.517
If you're up for it, here's my.

23:09.622 --> 23:12.423
My number, brand new.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.346
(phone rings)

23:35.348 --> 23:36.247
Shit!

24:01.674 --> 24:04.074
(dog barks)

24:28.434 --> 24:31.168
(ominous tones)

24:50.623 --> 24:51.522
Yes!

24:53.392 --> 24:54.291
Yes, I'm in.

25:01.868 --> 25:02.766
Holy shit.

25:06.005 --> 25:09.740
Oh my god
they're really pissed off.

25:11.777 --> 25:14.311
I guess that's how dealers
take care of business.

25:16.616 --> 25:17.181
Serves him right.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.418
This is real.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.489
This is happening right now.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.463
Oh my god all these
videos are real.

25:51.984 --> 25:52.883
Did I do this?

25:55.955 --> 25:57.421
Did I send those guys there?

26:01.694 --> 26:03.060
Oh god I killed him.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.776
No, no, no, no, no, no
don't go back.

26:18.778 --> 26:19.610
Don't go back.

26:19.612 --> 26:20.878
Run!

26:20.880 --> 26:22.313
Josh run!

26:22.315 --> 26:25.249
Get out of there now, run!

26:33.492 --> 26:34.391
- Hello?

26:34.393 --> 26:36.327
- Run.

26:36.329 --> 26:37.595
Run!

26:37.597 --> 26:40.898
(tense dramatic music)

26:48.708 --> 26:50.040
Josh.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.742
Josh can you hear me,
can you talk?

26:52.678 --> 26:54.411
- [Josh] N1ghtOwl, is that you?

26:54.413 --> 26:55.713
What the fuck's going on?

26:55.715 --> 26:57.215
- Josh listen to me, okay?

26:57.216 --> 26:58.716
You have to find somewhere
to hide, right now.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.818
Whatever you do, do not let
these guys see you, okay?

27:00.820 --> 27:02.453
Where are you?

27:02.455 --> 27:03.520
- [Josh] What the fuck?

27:03.522 --> 27:04.355
How'd you know?

27:04.357 --> 27:06.023
Wait, can you see me?

27:06.025 --> 27:07.725
- Look, I'll explain
everything later, okay?

27:07.727 --> 27:09.159
You just have to find somewhere
to hide.

27:09.161 --> 27:12.196
Please, please just tell me
where you are.

27:12.198 --> 27:14.081
- [Josh] I'm outside
in the bike shed.

27:14.082 --> 27:15.965
I didn't want those guys to
follow me back to my flat.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.301
- They're coming down
the stairs right now.

27:17.303 --> 27:20.137
Okay, you have to move
really quick.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.839
Just exit the bicycle shed

27:21.841 --> 27:24.375
and go down the eastern
staircase, turn left,

27:24.377 --> 27:25.643
and you'll be able to
make it back to your flat

27:25.645 --> 27:27.011
without anyone seeing you, okay?

27:27.013 --> 27:28.979
- [Josh] How'd you know
where I live?

27:28.981 --> 27:29.813
Who are you?

27:29.815 --> 27:31.415
- Josh, you need to move, now.

27:32.351 --> 27:33.250
Run!

27:35.588 --> 27:40.290
Oh come on, come on, come on,
come on.

27:40.292 --> 27:43.560
Yes, yes, yes.

27:43.562 --> 27:44.662
Yes.

27:44.664 --> 27:45.562
He's in.

27:50.236 --> 27:53.437
(ominous tones)

27:53.439 --> 27:55.673
(panting)

28:02.815 --> 28:05.783
(pounding at door)

28:15.294 --> 28:16.393
- [Man] Miss Banning?

28:18.297 --> 28:19.797
Miss Banning this is the police.

28:19.799 --> 28:20.898
Open the door please.

28:22.568 --> 28:23.834
Miss Eliza Banning.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.438
Miss Banning
please open the door.

28:27.440 --> 28:28.672
I know you're in there.

28:33.646 --> 28:36.647
(unsettling music)

28:42.621 --> 28:43.520
- I'm here.

28:45.791 --> 28:47.257
What's this about?

28:47.259 --> 28:49.326
- Miss Banning,
my name is Colin Holloway.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.427
I'm a police officer.

28:50.429 --> 28:54.732
A young man was found dead in
the apartment block opposite.

28:54.734 --> 28:57.034
I've got a couple of
things I need to ask you.

28:57.036 --> 28:59.903
- I'm sorry to hear that.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.405
Who was it?

29:01.407 --> 29:03.640
- A young man named
Tony Alvarado.

29:03.642 --> 29:04.875
Apparent suicide.

29:04.877 --> 29:07.144
Mr. Parker found the
body about an hour ago.

29:09.648 --> 29:11.548
- A, a suicide?

29:11.550 --> 29:12.516
- Looks like it.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.017
Drug overdose.

29:14.019 --> 29:16.987
Several of his neighbors
said they heard loud noises

29:16.989 --> 29:19.156
around the approximate time
of Mr. Alvarado's death.

29:19.158 --> 29:20.924
So we're not ruling out
foul play.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.761
Can you please open the
door so I can come in?

29:23.763 --> 29:26.697
- Um, I can't right now.

29:28.534 --> 29:31.935
You've caught me at a bad time.

29:31.937 --> 29:35.072
I'm, I'm more than happy
to answer your questions--

29:35.074 --> 29:38.909
- Miss, if speaking to me
face to face

29:38.911 --> 29:41.545
is too societal for you,
why don't you

29:42.681 --> 29:44.815
just give me your
telephone number.

29:48.721 --> 29:49.686
This is important.

29:50.723 --> 29:52.322
I need to be able to reach you.

29:53.259 --> 29:56.026
Mr. Parker said that he
saw you in your window

29:56.028 --> 29:58.195
earlier tonight and he
heard you shout.

29:59.865 --> 30:02.432
I want to find out whether
you've seen or heard

30:02.434 --> 30:03.934
anything out of the ordinary.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.106
I'll call you later on today.

30:09.108 --> 30:12.075
Please make yourself
available to speak then.

30:12.077 --> 30:14.178
If you continue
to be uncooperative,

30:14.180 --> 30:15.612
I'll be forced to come back.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.817
Look, take my number.

30:23.522 --> 30:27.291
If you need me, call me
at any time Miss Banning.

30:27.293 --> 30:28.826
Anytime, I insist.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.094
We'll speak soon.

31:00.226 --> 31:02.793
(phone rings)

31:19.879 --> 31:24.915
- [Josh] N1ghtOwl, it's Josh.

31:25.251 --> 31:26.884
N1ghtOwl, are you there?

31:26.886 --> 31:27.784
Talk to me.

31:29.922 --> 31:33.156
- Yeah yeah, yeah I'm still
here.

31:34.393 --> 31:37.027
Sorry I just, I didn't
expect to hear from you.

31:39.365 --> 31:40.264
Are you okay?

31:42.268 --> 31:43.384
- [Josh] Listen,
I'm on my way out,

31:43.385 --> 31:44.501
but if you have a minute,
I really wanna talk.

31:44.503 --> 31:45.502
It won't take long.

31:49.808 --> 31:50.707
- Sure.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.511
Wait, you mean right now?

31:55.981 --> 31:58.081
- Yeah now, I'm here so...

32:01.787 --> 32:06.690
- Actually I can't right now.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.725
But if you wanted to we could.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.560
- I mean I'm here,
I'm on your doorstep.

32:10.562 --> 32:11.895
- I followed the ringtone.

32:12.798 --> 32:14.197
Are you coming out or not?

32:14.199 --> 32:16.400
I think you owe me an
explanation about last night.

32:19.038 --> 32:22.706
- Yeah I, I know I do, I just,

32:23.509 --> 32:25.042
I can't seem to find my keys.

32:25.878 --> 32:28.078
- That's a good coincidence,
isn't it.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.113
Look, listen, thank you
for your help last night,

32:30.115 --> 32:31.515
but I'd appreciate it
if you had the decency

32:31.517 --> 32:32.549
to tell me what's been going on.

32:32.551 --> 32:33.850
And to stop stalking me as well.

32:33.852 --> 32:36.153
Seriously that's fucking creepy,
alright?

32:36.155 --> 32:38.789
So either tell me
what's been going

32:38.791 --> 32:41.925
or delete my number off
your phone now, alright?

32:41.927 --> 32:42.826
- No wait!

32:44.496 --> 32:45.662
I'm sorry.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.130
Really, I am.

32:47.132 --> 32:51.234
I didn't mean to
invade your privacy.

32:51.236 --> 32:57.307
I just, well I saw you move in
and I was curious about you,

32:57.309 --> 32:58.608
that's all.

32:58.610 --> 33:01.378
- So you just stumbled across
my MatchHunter's profile?

33:03.816 --> 33:05.949
- Yeah, I know I shouldn't have.

33:05.951 --> 33:07.551
I just...

33:07.553 --> 33:08.652
So are you okay?

33:10.155 --> 33:11.488
I mean did you,

33:11.490 --> 33:14.358
did you get back to your
flat safely last night?

33:14.360 --> 33:18.228
- Yeah, I think you know the
answer to that, but yeah,

33:18.230 --> 33:20.430
I'm fine, thanks.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.233
Thanks for the emergency
help line as well.

33:23.235 --> 33:25.769
That was, that was quite useful.

33:28.240 --> 33:31.641
My neighbor told me about
that loud guy downstairs.

33:32.511 --> 33:33.410
Tony.

33:34.913 --> 33:36.179
Did you know he died last night?

33:37.349 --> 33:40.384
Apparently the police are
saying it's a suicide.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.152
Were you the one
who called them?

33:42.154 --> 33:45.122
- No.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.724
It must have been the caretaker.

33:47.726 --> 33:51.495
But yeah, I did hear about it.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.798
He overdosed apparently.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.769
But why didn't the police
come and talk to you?

33:58.771 --> 34:00.971
I thought you were the
one who called them.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.707
- Nah.

34:03.709 --> 34:04.775
I don't speak to police.

34:04.777 --> 34:06.576
It usually just
makes matters worse.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.681
- So you didn't,
you didn't tell anyone

34:11.683 --> 34:13.316
about what happened last night?

34:14.219 --> 34:15.719
You know about those guys?

34:17.022 --> 34:18.355
- No.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.891
I wanted to know more first,
that's why I came to you.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.996
But those masked guys,
just happened to be around

34:25.998 --> 34:27.164
when Tony died, right?

34:27.966 --> 34:29.933
I mean the police were
saying it's a suicide.

34:29.935 --> 34:32.235
But I bet you
they were involved somehow.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.871
But you saw them, you were
watching the whole time.

34:34.873 --> 34:36.940
What did you see?

34:36.942 --> 34:38.809
- I didn't actually see much.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.980
I just saw them
hanging around and,

34:43.982 --> 34:46.249
you know they looked
suspicious, that's all.

34:47.086 --> 34:48.452
- Look, I have to go but,

34:48.454 --> 34:51.288
we can talk about this
some other time.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.456
I still wanna know
what happened.

34:52.458 --> 34:53.990
- [Eliza] Wait.

34:53.992 --> 34:57.327
I, I can contact you again?

34:59.498 --> 35:01.865
- Yeah, you can
contact me again.

35:06.205 --> 35:07.538
You gonna tell me your name

35:07.539 --> 35:08.872
or do I have to keep
calling you N1ghtOwl?

35:12.111 --> 35:17.180
- It's, it's Eliza, Liz.

35:17.549 --> 35:20.050
I'm, I'm Liz.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.821
- Alright Liz, I'm off.

35:26.992 --> 35:29.209
But see you later.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.427
Oh, the paint job on your
door's chipping away.

35:33.365 --> 35:34.664
- Wait, what paint job?

35:36.635 --> 35:37.634
- You need to get out more.

35:39.104 --> 35:41.671
(phone dings)

35:47.179 --> 35:48.678
- [TV Reporter] Washington,
the street protests

35:48.680 --> 35:50.614
are now growing bigger each day,

35:50.616 --> 35:52.983
pressing the authorities
for an answer.

36:08.233 --> 36:09.232
- Wait, that's not.

36:11.403 --> 36:12.602
That's not Tony's flat.

36:14.606 --> 36:15.505
How the?

36:17.509 --> 36:18.542
Oh wait that's her.

36:20.245 --> 36:21.511
That girl, she was with.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.581
Yeah.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.316
There you are
you fucking snitch.

36:27.119 --> 36:28.985
And how it is my phone
just happened

36:28.987 --> 36:30.820
to turn up in your flat?

36:30.822 --> 36:31.721
Unbelievable.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.360
Celebrity photographer, my ass.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.729
You're the one they
should be questioning.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.097
Asshole.

36:41.099 --> 36:43.066
I'll bet you anything
she's under age.

36:45.037 --> 36:45.936
Did he?

36:48.040 --> 36:49.506
Did he just spike her drink?

36:50.442 --> 36:53.176
(ominous tones)

37:00.018 --> 37:02.085
That bitch is trying to
get in my phone.

37:03.255 --> 37:06.923
What the fuck?

37:24.843 --> 37:25.742
- Joking?

37:27.846 --> 37:28.745
- I wish I was.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.047
- So you were just
making excuses

37:31.049 --> 37:32.482
when you said
you lost your keys.

37:33.785 --> 37:37.220
So, how long's it been since
you last stepped outside?

37:38.824 --> 37:39.923
- A couple of months?

37:41.627 --> 37:42.826
Half a year, tops.

37:44.329 --> 37:48.031
I'm not really good with people.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.935
- And there's no one you
could go to for help?

37:52.938 --> 37:54.871
Does your family know
about your situation?

37:57.943 --> 38:01.645
- It's just my dad now,
but yeah, he knows.

38:02.848 --> 38:05.448
We're not really
that close though.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.851
- Right.

38:07.853 --> 38:11.788
Well I mean, you seem
to be managing alright,

38:11.790 --> 38:16.826
no crazy bushy hair, no
super long fingernails.

38:17.329 --> 38:22.232
No dad and still a
desire to reach out

38:22.234 --> 38:23.800
and connect with others.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.035
Even though
it's through a screen,

38:25.037 --> 38:28.171
but well that's a start.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.377
That can be built upon.

38:34.378 --> 38:36.912
So Liz, what have you seen from
the top of your watch tower

38:36.915 --> 38:39.115
in the dark hours of
your sleepless nights?

38:40.319 --> 38:41.951
What do you know about me?

38:41.953 --> 38:42.886
- Oh, about you?

38:43.989 --> 38:49.059
Well, you like books,
detective novels mostly

38:49.261 --> 38:50.327
from what I've seen.

38:51.163 --> 38:53.129
And sports.

38:53.131 --> 38:54.264
Outdoor sports.

38:54.266 --> 38:57.233
I've seen that rucksack
you carry around with you

38:57.235 --> 38:59.035
with all the ropes
and stuff in it.

39:00.138 --> 39:02.605
I think it's climbing gear.

39:02.607 --> 39:05.508
Either that or you are
a professional hit man.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.444
- Oh yeah, just part time.

39:07.446 --> 39:09.713
(chuckles)

39:09.715 --> 39:13.450
- And I've seen you sleepwalk,
once.

39:14.319 --> 39:15.218
- Yeah.

39:15.220 --> 39:19.322
Sometimes that's when
I get a bit stressed

39:19.324 --> 39:22.892
or when I'm going through
a transition period

39:22.894 --> 39:25.061
where yeah,
it's a bit embarrassing.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.030
But I hope I had
some clothes on.

39:27.032 --> 39:31.000
- You did and it's,
it's not embarrassing.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.605
It sets you apart
from most people.

39:36.975 --> 39:40.043
Makes you different and
a bit special.

39:42.347 --> 39:45.048
- Speaking of special, we should
talk about the other night.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.716
You still owe me an explanation.

39:51.590 --> 39:52.489
Liz?

39:54.393 --> 39:56.960
Hey Liz, are you just gonna
start ignoring me now?

39:57.996 --> 40:01.698
- Sorry, can you
give me a second?

40:02.267 --> 40:04.267
My laptop's acting weird.

40:04.269 --> 40:05.301
- [Josh] What sort of
excuse is that?

40:05.303 --> 40:06.202
You got to talk about
this with me.

40:07.172 --> 40:08.505
Is something wrong?

40:08.507 --> 40:09.372
Those guys isn't it?

40:09.374 --> 40:10.707
Are they back?

40:10.709 --> 40:12.576
- I have to hang up.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.444
Okay, I will call you
back very soon, I promise.

40:14.446 --> 40:16.146
- [Josh] You said
you'd explain it.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.352
- Oh why can't I get rid
of this thing?

40:22.354 --> 40:24.888
(tense music)

40:24.890 --> 40:25.855
Screw this.

40:27.225 --> 40:29.459
(hissing)

40:30.462 --> 40:33.029
(phone rings)

40:41.206 --> 40:42.906
- [TV Reporter] Is under
way but still no trace

40:42.908 --> 40:44.741
of the missing teenager,
Susan Lynch,

40:44.743 --> 40:46.509
who disappeared
on Wednesday evening

40:46.511 --> 40:48.278
near Old Street Station.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.712
A metropolitan police spokesman

40:49.714 --> 40:52.048
said the disappearance occurred
in similar circumstances

40:52.050 --> 40:54.784
as the abduction of 18
year old Amy Bradley,

40:54.786 --> 40:56.686
who was found dead
two months ago.

40:56.688 --> 40:59.222
But specified no ransom
nor threat of any kind

40:59.224 --> 41:02.325
has been issued so far.
(phone dings)

41:02.327 --> 41:03.827
These are the headlines
for this hour

41:03.829 --> 41:06.229
and it's time now
for some entertainment.

41:06.231 --> 41:08.765
The Indie British horror film,
Unger 59

41:08.767 --> 41:11.601
has just won a streak of
awards at the 17th edition

41:11.603 --> 41:14.571
of the London based horror
blood gore film festival.

41:14.573 --> 41:16.323
Much to the delight

41:16.324 --> 41:18.074
of its young and emerging
production team,

41:18.076 --> 41:19.776
the film was received
with enthusiasm

41:19.778 --> 41:21.377
by critics and viewers alike.

41:21.379 --> 41:24.180
- [Colin] Ms. Banning,
this is Colin Holloway.

41:24.182 --> 41:26.182
I tried to call you twice
already, you didn't pick up.

41:26.184 --> 41:29.486
As it turns out, we do have a
file on you.

41:29.488 --> 41:31.221
I saw your record.

41:31.223 --> 41:34.057
I understand you're
unwillingness to pay us a visit.

41:34.059 --> 41:36.726
But I warn you that your lack
of cooperation will end up

41:36.728 --> 41:38.895
raising suspicions against you.

41:38.897 --> 41:41.898
I recommend you get back to
me by the end of tomorrow.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.767
If you don't, I'll be forced to
come back

41:44.769 --> 41:46.469
and bring you in
for questioning.

41:47.272 --> 41:49.172
I hope to hear from you
before then.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.607
You know where to reach me.

41:53.545 --> 41:56.546
(unsettling music)

42:15.901 --> 42:17.433
- What?

42:17.435 --> 42:18.668
No, no, no, no fucking way.

42:18.670 --> 42:20.470
How are you still here?

42:20.472 --> 42:23.873
(tense dramatic music)

42:23.875 --> 42:24.841
Kill or be killed.

42:26.044 --> 42:27.510
Nominate the next suicide.

42:30.916 --> 42:32.916
What's that,
is that a fucking countdown?

42:38.189 --> 42:40.056
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on,

42:40.058 --> 42:40.957
where are you, where are you?

42:43.728 --> 42:45.028
A friend of mine
even saw him die.

42:48.500 --> 42:49.599
Who the fuck are you?

42:53.505 --> 42:54.671
Hi Perfect Void.

42:54.673 --> 42:55.572
Remember me?

42:56.341 --> 42:57.807
I need to ask you something.

43:05.417 --> 43:07.250
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

43:08.386 --> 43:11.421
You got me in this mess,
now get me out of it.

43:11.423 --> 43:14.223
(computer beeps)

43:27.672 --> 43:29.472
I need to ask him about the
suicide club.

43:29.474 --> 43:31.207
Can you give me
his contact please?

43:31.209 --> 43:32.208
It's important.

43:58.970 --> 44:00.169
- So there you are.

44:02.974 --> 44:05.508
I wish we could have a
proper chat, face to face.

44:07.879 --> 44:10.213
Somehow I don't think that's
gonna happen though, is it.

44:12.384 --> 44:14.484
Now that I've got
your attention though,

44:16.121 --> 44:17.854
I'd like you to listen
to me very carefully.

44:19.691 --> 44:21.891
I know that you've taken an
interest in my daily life,

44:21.893 --> 44:25.928
but (sigh) as flattering as
that may be,

44:27.732 --> 44:30.700
I need to warn you that
I value my privacy.

44:32.737 --> 44:36.105
I know my rights and
I also know the law.

44:37.575 --> 44:40.610
Whatever you think you saw,
I'm not doing anything illegal.

44:41.780 --> 44:42.712
But you are.

44:44.649 --> 44:50.687
So if you ever tell anyone
about my private activities,

44:52.290 --> 44:53.856
I'll have to go to the police.

44:56.127 --> 44:59.095
Apparently they're still
investigating Alvarado's
suicide.

45:01.933 --> 45:04.901
Maybe I should send them the
evidence I found in his flat.

45:05.870 --> 45:07.904
I don't know do you think it
might help?

45:09.240 --> 45:11.340
- [Liz] Wait 'til one of you
idiots ODs and then we'll see

45:11.342 --> 45:13.910
who's laughing then
you stupid junkie.

45:13.912 --> 45:15.178
- So what's it gonna be?

45:17.682 --> 45:18.581
It's up to you.

45:19.884 --> 45:22.051
Do you think I should
send it to them?

45:22.053 --> 45:22.952
- No.

45:23.922 --> 45:25.221
There's no need.

45:25.223 --> 45:26.122
- Good.

45:27.158 --> 45:28.925
I'm glad we understand
each other.

45:45.477 --> 45:46.476
- Deadkidd.

45:50.148 --> 45:51.748
(sighs)

45:51.750 --> 45:52.882
Deadkidd, Deadkidd,
Deadkidd, Deadkidd,

45:53.918 --> 45:55.118
where the fuck are you?

46:40.498 --> 46:45.568
Only one way to find out.

46:53.878 --> 46:55.278
- [Man] Hello?

46:55.280 --> 46:56.179
- Deadkidd?

46:57.582 --> 46:59.482
- [Man] Who the hell is this?

46:59.484 --> 47:01.284
- It's another
suicide club member.

47:05.089 --> 47:09.225
Listen, I need your help,
it's really important.

47:09.227 --> 47:11.661
It's about the club,
it's about the website.

47:11.663 --> 47:13.429
I'm stuck on this page
and I can't...

47:13.431 --> 47:14.263
(man scoffs)

47:14.265 --> 47:15.531
- [Man] New member, huh?

47:16.701 --> 47:18.768
Oh you're in for a ride.

47:18.770 --> 47:21.771
Down goes the endless
spiral, all the way down.

47:26.277 --> 47:27.543
- Wait, what do you mean?

47:27.545 --> 47:29.145
Who were those guys?

47:29.147 --> 47:32.815
- [Man] They are, they
just, they just are.

47:32.817 --> 47:35.785
The spiral will show you you
need to dive.

47:35.787 --> 47:39.589
Trying to stop the flow is
like you can't undo death.

47:39.591 --> 47:41.424
Once you're in,
there's no way out.

47:42.360 --> 47:45.361
- Wait, are you saying
it acts like a virus,

47:45.363 --> 47:46.696
like a computer virus?

47:46.698 --> 47:48.481
- [Man] They know.

47:48.482 --> 47:50.265
They know who you are and
they know where you are.

47:50.268 --> 47:52.268
And they know you to core.

47:52.270 --> 47:54.036
They even see beyond
what you are.

47:55.006 --> 47:57.473
Look, there's a rumor spreading,
okay?

47:57.475 --> 48:00.877
Some members are actually
invited to connect with them.

48:00.879 --> 48:04.113
They're being recruited,
like being chosen.

48:05.683 --> 48:06.983
You get me.

48:06.985 --> 48:11.220
- You're talking about
nominations, aren't you?

48:11.222 --> 48:12.555
I think I've been chosen.

48:14.459 --> 48:17.293
Wait, what happens if you
don't name someone in time?

48:19.597 --> 48:21.197
- [Man] It's kill or be killed.

48:22.133 --> 48:25.735
Remember, (laughs) what,

48:26.571 --> 48:28.771
you joined because you
wanted to die, right?

48:28.773 --> 48:31.741
(phone clicks off)

48:41.486 --> 48:42.385
- Okay.

48:44.222 --> 48:46.188
Let's settle this
once and for all.

48:52.931 --> 48:54.697
This is what you get for
trying to blackmail me

48:54.699 --> 48:55.731
you fucking psycho.

48:58.002 --> 49:01.837
(clicking and creaking)

49:01.839 --> 49:04.907
(suspenseful music)

49:17.422 --> 49:18.521
Josh?
- Shit.

49:18.523 --> 49:19.422
Fuck, sorry.

49:20.925 --> 49:22.525
I didn't see you there.

49:22.527 --> 49:24.327
- What the fuck are you
doing here?

49:25.930 --> 49:28.164
- You did hang up on me
in the conversation, so...

49:30.468 --> 49:32.902
- Did, did you just climb
in through my window?

49:33.938 --> 49:35.338
- Uh, yeah.

49:35.340 --> 49:37.106
I'm a climber, remember?

49:37.108 --> 49:38.941
And it wasn't even
locked properly.

49:42.814 --> 49:44.280
Someone's a bit on edge, eh?

49:47.785 --> 49:48.918
Do you remember when you
said you'd explain everything

49:48.920 --> 49:50.186
when you got the chance?

49:52.390 --> 49:53.289
Well this is it.

49:54.826 --> 49:57.193
You've been watching him
for a while then?

49:57.195 --> 49:58.227
Ever seen him deal?

49:59.364 --> 50:00.262
- No.

50:01.599 --> 50:04.533
I saw him, saw him use though.

50:04.535 --> 50:05.434
Plenty.

50:06.838 --> 50:09.005
Weed, pills, you name it.

50:09.841 --> 50:11.741
- But you never saw him deal.

50:11.743 --> 50:14.043
You can't prove that he
was selling anything?

50:16.180 --> 50:17.079
- No.

50:18.816 --> 50:20.383
- If he didn't OD by accident,

50:21.285 --> 50:23.152
and if the police didn't find
any evidence

50:23.154 --> 50:24.820
that anyone else was
involved in his death,

50:24.822 --> 50:27.223
then where do you think
those masked guys come in?

50:28.259 --> 50:30.292
- I don't think they
fit in anywhere.

50:30.294 --> 50:33.162
I mean this area does have
a lot of gangs.

50:33.164 --> 50:34.964
- Come on, are you serious?

50:34.966 --> 50:35.798
It can't just be a coincidence.

50:35.800 --> 50:36.599
Look at the timing.

50:36.601 --> 50:37.950
I mean those guys

50:37.951 --> 50:39.300
must've been involved
in this death somehow.

50:41.706 --> 50:43.156
- How?

50:43.157 --> 50:44.607
The police,
they didn't find anything.

50:44.609 --> 50:46.575
No evidence, no fingerprints,
nothing.

50:50.581 --> 50:54.917
- Have you, have you ever
heard of an online community

50:54.919 --> 50:56.185
called the suicide club?

50:57.855 --> 51:01.390
There's lots of rumors
going around about it.

51:02.160 --> 51:03.259
Have you heard of it?

51:04.595 --> 51:08.164
- Yeah, it's an urban legend.

51:08.166 --> 51:09.765
Of course I've heard of it.

51:09.767 --> 51:11.434
- What if it wasn't
just a legend,

51:11.436 --> 51:13.736
what if Tony was
connected to it,

51:13.738 --> 51:15.538
what if those guys
were part of it?

51:18.142 --> 51:21.510
- No (laughs), it seems a
bit silly if you ask me.

51:22.480 --> 51:25.247
I'm sure there's
a rational explanation

51:25.249 --> 51:26.248
for this whole thing.

51:26.250 --> 51:27.750
- Listen to you.

51:27.751 --> 51:29.251
You sound like
one of those naive coppers

51:29.253 --> 51:30.653
that just wants to take
the easy option out

51:30.655 --> 51:33.622
so they can get back to
their desk and their donuts.

51:33.624 --> 51:34.523
- No.

51:35.860 --> 51:38.294
I hate police just as
much as I hate thugs.

51:40.398 --> 51:41.497
They can actually carry weapons

51:41.499 --> 51:43.666
and beat the shit out of you,
so...

51:46.537 --> 51:48.370
You don't seem too keen on them.

51:50.007 --> 51:52.541
And I thought you were a
fan of the detective novels.

51:53.511 --> 51:54.977
- I don't know, I just,

51:54.979 --> 51:57.847
I find their neglect of
vulnerable people

51:57.849 --> 51:59.415
staggering at times.

52:03.254 --> 52:07.723
We had a kid at school, James,

52:10.261 --> 52:12.795
he was going through all sorts
of shit.

52:15.466 --> 52:17.266
And he started taking it
out on himself physically

52:17.268 --> 52:18.901
and on others around him.

52:18.903 --> 52:20.636
So the police got involved.

52:21.939 --> 52:23.139
Said they'd take him
out of school

52:23.141 --> 52:24.840
and away from home immediately.

52:24.842 --> 52:28.077
Get a social worker to see
him, but they never did.

52:28.079 --> 52:30.479
We kept calling them
and nothing.

52:30.481 --> 52:32.414
They said they had
more pressing concerns.

52:32.416 --> 52:33.382
They did fuck all.

52:37.388 --> 52:39.388
Couple of days later
they found James.

52:42.226 --> 52:43.859
There was a note with his body.

52:45.496 --> 52:47.062
Time to join the suicide club.

52:51.169 --> 52:53.235
(sighs)

52:56.741 --> 52:57.606
You know what?

52:57.608 --> 52:59.608
Next time I'm around here,

52:59.610 --> 53:01.544
we should definitely give it a
clean up,

53:01.546 --> 53:04.480
'cause this place looks like
it's been nuked and flooded,

53:05.716 --> 53:06.615
at the same time.

53:07.785 --> 53:08.684
Twice.

53:09.620 --> 53:10.519
- Oh.

53:12.423 --> 53:17.493
- So, do you wanna watch
a film or something?

53:18.930 --> 53:20.629
- Okay, yeah.

53:20.631 --> 53:24.200
(upbeat electronic music)

54:50.688 --> 54:53.856
Shit, why the fuck
is it not working?

55:00.097 --> 55:01.397
I checked, I checked it.

55:01.399 --> 55:02.364
That's def.

55:04.468 --> 55:06.468
Or that's not his name.

55:10.341 --> 55:11.573
Where is that?

55:24.488 --> 55:25.521
- What are you doing?

55:25.523 --> 55:26.955
- Oh nothing.

55:26.957 --> 55:28.357
I'm just checking my e-mails.

55:32.029 --> 55:33.662
- Shit.

55:33.664 --> 55:34.563
I overslept.

55:36.567 --> 55:38.801
- Oh don't worry about
the boxes and stuff.

55:38.803 --> 55:39.702
Just leave 'em.

55:40.838 --> 55:42.304
- Yeah, what was I thinking?

55:57.054 --> 55:58.454
- See you later.

56:10.334 --> 56:12.334
(phone beeps)

56:12.336 --> 56:13.168
Oh shit.

56:13.170 --> 56:14.069
Oh, I'm okay.

56:14.071 --> 56:17.406
Could you do something
about the window next time?

56:17.408 --> 56:19.408
I feel like a bit of a twat.

56:21.379 --> 56:22.277
- Okay, got it.

56:23.481 --> 56:26.448
(footsteps fading)

56:28.419 --> 56:31.420
(unsettling music)

56:34.759 --> 56:35.657
Come on.

56:37.628 --> 56:39.461
There must be
a way out of this thing.

56:40.631 --> 56:42.564
There must be something
else I can do here.

57:02.386 --> 57:03.285
Oh come on.

57:04.622 --> 57:05.654
Not another pop up.

57:05.656 --> 57:07.456
Please, just leave me alone.

57:38.322 --> 57:40.889
(phone dings)

57:41.759 --> 57:44.493
(hopeful music)

57:58.943 --> 58:00.809
What the hell are you
playing at Parker?

58:02.780 --> 58:04.012
Just who the fuck are you?

58:11.622 --> 58:13.489
Come on Josh, just leave.

58:13.491 --> 58:14.423
Go on leave him.

58:31.041 --> 58:31.940
Fuck.

58:41.018 --> 58:43.752
(ominous tones)

58:52.963 --> 58:56.365
Oh let me guess,
you're now into wildlife

58:56.367 --> 58:58.467
and investigative journalism?

58:58.469 --> 59:01.203
You were just saving the fashion
portfolio for the blonde.

59:08.979 --> 59:10.245
Shit.

59:10.247 --> 59:13.582
(tense dramatic music)

59:19.490 --> 59:20.389
Oh no.

59:21.525 --> 59:22.424
No, no way.

59:33.470 --> 59:36.438
Miss Lynch went missing
on Wednesday the 17th.

59:36.440 --> 59:37.973
She was last seen in the
supermarket

59:37.975 --> 59:39.541
near Old Street Station.

59:40.778 --> 59:42.344
Metropolitan police
have confirmed

59:42.346 --> 59:43.612
the case bears similarities

59:43.614 --> 59:45.113
with the kidnapping of
Amy Bradley

59:45.115 --> 59:48.817
whose body was found two
months ago in a parking lot.

59:51.422 --> 59:53.255
Is she the one I saw?

59:57.161 --> 59:59.895
Come on Josh, I don't like this.

1:00:01.131 --> 1:00:03.365
Let's get you out of here.

1:00:13.510 --> 1:00:15.010
Oh where are you?

1:00:17.615 --> 1:00:19.681
(sighs)

1:00:28.125 --> 1:00:29.024
Good.

1:00:30.127 --> 1:00:32.961
(computer beeps)

1:00:46.443 --> 1:00:47.342
Oh no.

1:00:48.646 --> 1:00:50.412
Just fuck off!

1:00:50.414 --> 1:00:51.780
Fuck off!

1:00:51.782 --> 1:00:55.117
(tense dramatic music)

1:01:26.483 --> 1:01:29.484
(unsettling music)

1:01:35.125 --> 1:01:36.191
What's that?

1:01:44.368 --> 1:01:45.434
Who are you?

1:01:51.308 --> 1:01:52.374
No masks, no gloves.

1:01:56.213 --> 1:01:57.079
This is sloppy.

1:01:58.816 --> 1:01:59.981
They're too organized.

1:01:59.983 --> 1:02:00.882
They'd never.

1:02:06.290 --> 1:02:07.923
You're not members of the club.

1:02:10.360 --> 1:02:11.793
You're just a regular user.

1:02:54.171 --> 1:02:55.070
Wait.

1:03:02.713 --> 1:03:03.612
Deadkidd?

1:03:09.386 --> 1:03:10.285
3rd choice.

1:03:12.122 --> 1:03:14.689
The 3rd choice, that wasn't
there before.

1:03:16.860 --> 1:03:17.759
Fuck.

1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:24.399
No, no, no no no.

1:03:24.401 --> 1:03:25.634
Not now, fuck.

1:03:28.205 --> 1:03:29.504
Fuck.

1:03:29.506 --> 1:03:30.806
Come on Josh, come on
Josh pick up, pick up,

1:03:30.808 --> 1:03:32.908
pick up, pick up.

1:03:32.910 --> 1:03:34.009
- [Josh] Let me guess,
you want me to come over

1:03:34.011 --> 1:03:36.611
right now because
you miss me so much?

1:03:36.613 --> 1:03:39.247
(upbeat music)

1:04:04.041 --> 1:04:05.874
- [TV Reporter] Spokesman
confirmed this statement

1:04:05.876 --> 1:04:07.909
and just reported that
Susan Lynch's body

1:04:07.911 --> 1:04:09.678
has been found buried

1:04:09.679 --> 1:04:11.446
in the park in Hackney
earlier this afternoon.

1:04:11.448 --> 1:04:14.549
The 20 year old has been
missing since Wednesday 17th

1:04:14.551 --> 1:04:16.885
in what appears to be the
2nd kidnapping in the area

1:04:16.887 --> 1:04:18.420
in the last two months.

1:04:18.422 --> 1:04:21.323
The police confirmed the
case is now a murder inquiry,

1:04:21.325 --> 1:04:24.125
but refuse to name any
suspect for the time being.

1:04:24.127 --> 1:04:27.128
And just as the news of the
discovery reaches our studio,

1:04:27.130 --> 1:04:29.497
we are informed that another
missing person inquiry

1:04:29.499 --> 1:04:30.599
has been opened today,

1:04:30.601 --> 1:04:33.568
after 19 year old Kelly
Reshnick failed to return

1:04:33.570 --> 1:04:35.670
to her family three days ago.

1:04:35.672 --> 1:04:37.706
- Oh Josh, I didn't hear you
come in.

1:04:37.708 --> 1:04:39.241
- Well climbing in would be
more accurate.

1:04:39.243 --> 1:04:41.376
But yeah, I came as quickly
as I could.

1:04:41.378 --> 1:04:42.744
Just got busy at work.

1:04:42.746 --> 1:04:43.879
There you go.

1:04:43.881 --> 1:04:46.615
- Thank you,
you're a life saver.

1:04:46.617 --> 1:04:48.016
I'll be with you in a sec.

1:04:48.018 --> 1:04:49.618
I just have to send this e-mail.

1:04:49.620 --> 1:04:51.370
Help yourself to some food

1:04:51.371 --> 1:04:53.121
and I think there's some
coffee on the side too.

1:04:53.123 --> 1:04:54.623
- [TV Reporter] The boat
capsized in the North Sea

1:04:54.625 --> 1:04:56.791
and at least 20
of its passengers

1:04:56.793 --> 1:04:58.727
are still unaccounted for.

1:04:58.729 --> 1:05:00.662
This crossing route
of the Mediterranean

1:05:00.664 --> 1:05:02.364
is seen as
particularly dangerous.

1:05:02.366 --> 1:05:04.499
(tense dramatic music)

1:05:04.501 --> 1:05:07.035
- [Josh] So, you're ready?

1:05:07.037 --> 1:05:08.770
- Sorry, for what?

1:05:08.772 --> 1:05:10.171
- Room service Ms. Banning.

1:05:10.173 --> 1:05:11.573
Long overdue.

1:05:11.575 --> 1:05:14.809
(upbeat techno music)

1:05:50.047 --> 1:05:52.047
- I can't believe
this is my flat.

1:05:52.049 --> 1:05:53.214
(Josh snickers)

1:05:53.216 --> 1:05:54.716
I barely recognize the place.

1:05:58.188 --> 1:05:59.521
- Six months of solitude.

1:06:01.358 --> 1:06:03.258
I can't imagine what
that must've been like.

1:06:09.967 --> 1:06:10.932
- Actually I lied.

1:06:13.136 --> 1:06:14.602
It's been a bit more than that.

1:06:20.110 --> 1:06:21.076
- How much longer?

1:06:28.685 --> 1:06:29.584
- Three years?

1:06:30.487 --> 1:06:31.386
- [Josh] Fuck.

1:06:34.124 --> 1:06:35.190
- Honestly I'm fine.

1:06:38.562 --> 1:06:39.461
I'm used to it.

1:06:45.502 --> 1:06:47.369
When I was 11, my mom died

1:06:47.371 --> 1:06:50.572
and my dad didn't know how
to deal with it, or me,

1:06:50.574 --> 1:06:55.043
so, he just flung himself into
his work

1:06:55.045 --> 1:06:56.778
and sent me away
to boarding school.

1:06:56.780 --> 1:06:57.846
(sad music)

1:06:57.848 --> 1:06:59.948
Since then I've never
really had a home

1:07:01.151 --> 1:07:02.283
or anyone to talk to.

1:07:04.955 --> 1:07:06.121
He sends me money when he can.

1:07:06.123 --> 1:07:08.390
I guess that's his way
of trying to help me.

1:07:10.260 --> 1:07:14.562
- [Josh] So, you ever had
anyone you trusted to speak to?

1:07:15.766 --> 1:07:18.266
- Last time I did that,
it kinda backfired on me.

1:07:21.038 --> 1:07:23.838
There was this
teacher at school.

1:07:25.342 --> 1:07:28.910
He could see I was struggling

1:07:28.912 --> 1:07:32.347
and he told me to channel my
grief into something positive.

1:07:33.617 --> 1:07:35.550
He encouraged me to draw.

1:07:35.552 --> 1:07:36.818
I was pretty good at it.

1:07:42.359 --> 1:07:43.691
He was really nice to me.

1:07:47.431 --> 1:07:49.097
We spent a lot of time together.

1:07:55.439 --> 1:07:58.073
(ominous tones)

1:07:58.075 --> 1:07:59.240
And then one day he...

1:08:03.380 --> 1:08:04.579
He put his hands on me.

1:08:08.885 --> 1:08:10.652
I don't even know how long it
went on for.

1:08:10.654 --> 1:08:11.653
I've forgotten now.

1:08:18.061 --> 1:08:20.228
And then I couldn't
take it anymore.

1:08:20.230 --> 1:08:24.732
I just, I snapped.

1:08:28.338 --> 1:08:30.572
And the police were
called and it got ugly.

1:08:35.745 --> 1:08:40.515
From that moment, I didn't
think my life had meaning.

1:08:48.725 --> 1:08:50.291
I just didn't want to exist.

1:08:52.496 --> 1:08:53.928
I felt like I had no value.

1:08:56.333 --> 1:08:57.165
- Guess what?

1:08:57.167 --> 1:08:58.066
You do.

1:09:00.570 --> 1:09:04.105
You should never
have to doubt that.

1:09:04.107 --> 1:09:06.674
And, no one should
be left alone.

1:09:10.981 --> 1:09:14.482
So, here's what I think
you should do.

1:09:17.154 --> 1:09:18.686
Take those locks off your door.

1:09:20.590 --> 1:09:21.523
Go outside again.

1:09:22.759 --> 1:09:23.892
Taste the real world.

1:09:25.028 --> 1:09:26.928
There's good people out there.

1:09:30.300 --> 1:09:31.199
Promise.

1:09:45.382 --> 1:09:46.781
(laughs)

1:09:46.783 --> 1:09:51.853
- So, have you made any new
friends in the neighborhood yet?

1:09:53.223 --> 1:09:54.055
- No, not really.

1:09:54.057 --> 1:09:55.490
It's been a big hectic at work.

1:09:56.593 --> 1:10:00.328
It was that guy downstairs,
Parker, the photographer.

1:10:00.330 --> 1:10:01.496
- Josh, stay away from him.

1:10:01.498 --> 1:10:02.397
- [Josh] Why?

1:10:04.201 --> 1:10:06.201
- Look, I know this is gonna
sound weird,

1:10:07.070 --> 1:10:09.671
but I've been watching him
for a while now

1:10:09.673 --> 1:10:12.407
and there is something
really fishy about him.

1:10:14.010 --> 1:10:16.611
He has this website presenting
himself as a photographer,

1:10:16.613 --> 1:10:19.681
but that's bullshit, that's not
who he is.

1:10:19.683 --> 1:10:21.950
- I've been round to his,
he showed me some pictures.

1:10:21.952 --> 1:10:23.451
Look, I even took a snapshot.

1:10:27.057 --> 1:10:29.057
- What do you mean, like this?

1:10:30.660 --> 1:10:32.026
- Yeah, exactly.

1:10:33.163 --> 1:10:34.395
- Josh, that's not his.

1:10:35.932 --> 1:10:37.165
He stole it from a website.

1:10:37.167 --> 1:10:38.066
Look.

1:10:41.605 --> 1:10:45.273
- (scoffs) Why would he do that?

1:10:50.447 --> 1:10:52.880
- Listen you've heard about
the missing girl right?

1:10:52.882 --> 1:10:54.182
The one from around here.

1:10:55.518 --> 1:10:57.619
They found her body today.

1:10:57.621 --> 1:10:59.187
- Really?

1:10:59.189 --> 1:11:01.789
Do you mean,
the girl that got kidnapped,

1:11:01.791 --> 1:11:03.291
that's been all over the...

1:11:04.194 --> 1:11:06.394
(laughs) You don't think Parker
had something to do with it,

1:11:06.396 --> 1:11:07.295
do you?

1:11:08.131 --> 1:11:09.163
- I don't know.

1:11:10.033 --> 1:11:12.900
But I've seen him
with a couple of girls

1:11:12.902 --> 1:11:15.236
and they looked really young.

1:11:16.573 --> 1:11:18.072
And I know
this sounds crazy okay?

1:11:18.074 --> 1:11:19.707
But one of them was brunette

1:11:19.709 --> 1:11:21.209
and she looked a lot
like the missing girl.

1:11:21.211 --> 1:11:22.277
- [Josh] Are you serious?

1:11:22.279 --> 1:11:24.045
- I'm just telling you
what I saw.

1:11:25.915 --> 1:11:28.216
This man,
he lives a double life.

1:11:28.218 --> 1:11:29.584
I'm sure of it.

1:11:29.586 --> 1:11:32.287
And he hangs around
with really young girls.

1:11:32.289 --> 1:11:33.321
Don't you think that's creepy?

1:11:33.323 --> 1:11:35.056
- Creepier than stalking people?

1:11:35.058 --> 1:11:35.890
I don't know, alright,

1:11:35.892 --> 1:11:38.026
it does sound a bit dodgy.

1:11:38.027 --> 1:11:40.161
But this is all based on your
own perception of things.

1:11:40.163 --> 1:11:42.864
From your tower,
out of your window.

1:11:42.866 --> 1:11:45.033
- So you're just saying
this is all in my head,

1:11:45.035 --> 1:11:46.134
I'm just paranoid?

1:11:46.136 --> 1:11:48.202
- No, no I never said that.

1:11:50.340 --> 1:11:52.073
I was just waiting
for you to say it.

1:11:52.075 --> 1:11:54.208
(laughs)

1:11:57.414 --> 1:11:59.064
- Okay, so you're telling me

1:11:59.065 --> 1:12:00.715
you didn't see anything
unusual at his place?

1:12:01.918 --> 1:12:02.884
- No.

1:12:02.886 --> 1:12:03.785
Nothing.

1:12:05.088 --> 1:12:07.055
But maybe I could
do some detecting.

1:12:08.958 --> 1:12:11.626
I could try and get some
proof next time I see him.

1:12:11.628 --> 1:12:14.162
Ask to see some
negatives or something.

1:12:14.164 --> 1:12:16.230
I'll be like your
undercover agent.

1:12:16.232 --> 1:12:18.733
And you could watch from
here, see how he reacts.

1:12:20.103 --> 1:12:21.903
- (stifles laughter) Okay.

1:12:22.706 --> 1:12:23.604
Sure.

1:12:24.641 --> 1:12:26.140
Well why don't you
start your report

1:12:26.142 --> 1:12:28.076
by telling me what the
two of you spoke about,

1:12:28.078 --> 1:12:30.144
'cause I know he asked about me.

1:12:30.146 --> 1:12:31.412
- Yeah, he did.

1:12:33.550 --> 1:12:37.185
He asked me
if you were my girlfriend.

1:12:37.187 --> 1:12:39.354
(laughs)

1:12:47.497 --> 1:12:50.231
(ominous tones)

1:12:57.574 --> 1:13:00.875
(door rattling)

1:13:00.877 --> 1:13:04.178
(tense dramatic music)

1:13:27.404 --> 1:13:29.637
- [Man] Is anyone there?

1:13:29.639 --> 1:13:32.039
(man gasps)

1:13:55.765 --> 1:13:57.265
- Kill or be killed.

1:13:57.267 --> 1:13:59.167
So that's what it all meant.

1:13:59.169 --> 1:14:02.603
Either you name yourself or
you get someone else killed.

1:14:02.605 --> 1:14:04.305
Members either die or
join the club.

1:14:04.307 --> 1:14:06.107
That's how they pick them.

1:14:06.109 --> 1:14:09.243
And if you don't name anyone
before the countdown is over,

1:14:09.245 --> 1:14:10.945
they make the choice for you.

1:14:12.649 --> 1:14:15.450
Is that what I have to
do to break the cycle?

1:14:15.452 --> 1:14:16.350
Kill someone?

1:14:17.887 --> 1:14:19.354
And what if it doesn't work?

1:14:19.355 --> 1:14:20.822
How do I know
they'll let me off the hook?

1:14:20.824 --> 1:14:22.790
I mean that's murder,
a real murder.

1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:25.193
And for what?

1:14:25.195 --> 1:14:26.661
Why would these guys
even pick me?

1:14:26.663 --> 1:14:28.296
I'd never.

1:14:28.298 --> 1:14:29.197
No.

1:14:29.199 --> 1:14:32.567
No way, I'm not killing
for you, you bastards.

1:14:32.569 --> 1:14:35.870
(tense dramatic music)

1:14:56.092 --> 1:14:59.260
(heartbeat thumping)

1:15:12.408 --> 1:15:13.374
(gasps)

1:15:13.376 --> 1:15:15.877
(exclaims)

1:15:15.879 --> 1:15:19.180
(high pitched ringing)

1:15:43.940 --> 1:15:47.074
(eerie, tense music)

1:16:30.153 --> 1:16:31.185
Oh my god, move.

1:16:47.971 --> 1:16:51.339
Shit.

1:16:51.341 --> 1:16:53.975
(upbeat music)

1:17:26.309 --> 1:17:29.210
(sighs and pants)

1:18:18.761 --> 1:18:21.829
(suspenseful music)

1:18:48.691 --> 1:18:51.392
- Look who decided to turn up.

1:18:51.394 --> 1:18:53.627
You took your time.

1:18:53.629 --> 1:18:54.962
(punch thuds)

1:18:54.964 --> 1:18:58.299
(tense dramatic music)

1:19:11.314 --> 1:19:13.047
(pants)

1:19:13.049 --> 1:19:15.349
(pounding)

1:19:25.895 --> 1:19:28.462
- [Liz] Josh, Josh are you okay?

1:19:28.464 --> 1:19:30.297
Are you hurt?

1:19:30.299 --> 1:19:31.132
- I'm okay.

1:19:31.134 --> 1:19:31.966
Shit.

1:19:31.968 --> 1:19:32.867
Parker, he attacked me.

1:19:32.868 --> 1:19:33.767
I woke up and
I wasn't in my room.

1:19:33.770 --> 1:19:35.202
There was this fucking body.

1:19:35.204 --> 1:19:36.036
Where is he?

1:19:36.038 --> 1:19:38.489
Is he still there?

1:19:38.490 --> 1:19:40.941
- [Liz] Come on, come
on, we have to go, quick.

1:19:42.411 --> 1:19:46.714
- [Josh] Oh gee, did you, did
you do this?

1:19:46.716 --> 1:19:47.915
- Oh come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1:19:47.917 --> 1:19:49.316
Shit.

1:19:49.318 --> 1:19:52.219
- Liz, we have to
call the police.

1:19:53.089 --> 1:19:53.921
Liz, did you hear me?

1:19:53.923 --> 1:19:54.755
This is serious.

1:19:54.757 --> 1:19:55.556
- Josh, look around you.

1:19:55.558 --> 1:19:56.607
I've just killed someone.

1:19:56.608 --> 1:19:57.657
If you call the police
I am fucked.

1:19:57.660 --> 1:19:58.526
I need to leave.

1:19:58.528 --> 1:19:59.360
- What are you talking about?

1:19:59.362 --> 1:20:00.328
He's a murderer.

1:20:00.329 --> 1:20:01.295
Who knows what
would have happened

1:20:01.297 --> 1:20:02.129
if you hadn't done it.

1:20:02.131 --> 1:20:03.347
- No, listen.

1:20:03.348 --> 1:20:04.564
You know when you asked
me if the masked guys

1:20:04.567 --> 1:20:06.834
were involved with the suicide
club, well you were right.

1:20:06.836 --> 1:20:08.102
Okay it's real, the club's real.

1:20:08.104 --> 1:20:09.904
This is all real.

1:20:09.906 --> 1:20:11.772
They forced Tony
to commit suicide.

1:20:11.774 --> 1:20:13.307
They killed him Josh,
I saw them.

1:20:13.309 --> 1:20:14.141
- What are you on about?

1:20:14.143 --> 1:20:15.242
- Just let me finish, okay?

1:20:15.244 --> 1:20:16.977
They have this website
where they claim

1:20:16.979 --> 1:20:18.546
they can help people
commit suicide.

1:20:18.548 --> 1:20:20.514
But some of the videos
are actual murders, Josh,

1:20:20.516 --> 1:20:21.982
they are killing people.

1:20:21.984 --> 1:20:23.984
And now they're targeting
users and asking them

1:20:23.986 --> 1:20:25.085
to name the next victim.

1:20:25.087 --> 1:20:26.754
It's like some sick game.

1:20:26.756 --> 1:20:28.556
You either die or
you join the club.

1:20:28.558 --> 1:20:30.257
And they're buying
people's silence

1:20:30.259 --> 1:20:31.225
by getting them involved.

1:20:31.227 --> 1:20:32.393
The only way you can get out,

1:20:32.395 --> 1:20:33.861
the only way you can
break the cycle

1:20:33.863 --> 1:20:35.596
is to become
a murderer yourself.

1:20:36.966 --> 1:20:38.766
Look, when I saw
Parker take you,

1:20:38.768 --> 1:20:41.669
I just, I just had to go for it.

1:20:42.905 --> 1:20:45.206
I was supposed to kill him
and record it on my phone,

1:20:45.208 --> 1:20:46.974
but now Parker's dead
and my phone's fucked

1:20:46.976 --> 1:20:48.008
and they are coming for me.

1:20:48.010 --> 1:20:49.009
I need to leave right now.

1:20:49.011 --> 1:20:50.845
I need to pack my shit and I
need to go.

1:20:50.847 --> 1:20:52.279
- Wait.

1:20:52.281 --> 1:20:53.314
Let me go with you.

1:20:53.316 --> 1:20:54.582
You're panicking, you're
not thinking straight.

1:20:54.584 --> 1:20:56.250
You haven't left your
flat for three years.

1:20:56.252 --> 1:20:58.018
Have you got anyone out
there that can help you?

1:20:58.020 --> 1:20:58.853
Do you even have any money?

1:20:58.855 --> 1:21:00.254
Do you know where you're going?

1:21:00.255 --> 1:21:01.654
- Okay, okay, okay, but we
need to leave right now.

1:21:01.657 --> 1:21:02.790
- Fine, give me five minutes.

1:21:02.792 --> 1:21:04.625
I'll get dressed and
I'll meet you outside.

1:21:06.729 --> 1:21:08.229
- I'm sorry.

1:21:08.231 --> 1:21:11.165
I'm sorry I dragged
you into this.

1:21:11.167 --> 1:21:13.400
- Well let's find a way
to get out of it.

1:21:13.402 --> 1:21:16.704
(tense dramatic music)

1:21:37.260 --> 1:21:38.158
- Eliza Banning.

1:21:39.629 --> 1:21:40.527
Welcome back.

1:21:41.497 --> 1:21:43.097
We've been anxious to meet you.

1:21:44.700 --> 1:21:45.733
- Wait, it's done.

1:21:45.735 --> 1:21:46.700
I did it.

1:21:48.237 --> 1:21:49.136
- You did what?

1:21:51.374 --> 1:21:53.240
- I killed a guy.

1:21:54.310 --> 1:21:58.212
Just now I, I went into his
apartment and I killed him.

1:22:00.049 --> 1:22:01.649
That's what you wanted me to do,
right?

1:22:01.651 --> 1:22:02.716
I followed your instructions.

1:22:02.718 --> 1:22:04.118
It's the 3rd choice okay?

1:22:05.154 --> 1:22:07.354
It's done, I'm out, we're done.

1:22:07.356 --> 1:22:09.556
- Anything you'd like
to share with us then?

1:22:12.228 --> 1:22:13.928
- I tried to record it
but my um,

1:22:15.731 --> 1:22:17.097
but my screen got smashed okay?

1:22:17.099 --> 1:22:21.101
I fought with him and I
dropped my phone, but look,

1:22:21.103 --> 1:22:22.503
I have his blood
on my jumper okay?

1:22:22.505 --> 1:22:25.239
It's right over here,
I can prove it to you.

1:22:25.241 --> 1:22:27.508
- [Man] I don't doubt you Liz,

1:22:27.510 --> 1:22:29.944
but we have professional
standards to maintain.

1:22:29.946 --> 1:22:33.314
And an entire community
to entertain, as you know.

1:22:35.217 --> 1:22:36.116
- Entertain?

1:22:36.118 --> 1:22:40.321
- And without any visual
proof of the deed on file,

1:22:40.323 --> 1:22:43.924
I'm afraid we can't accept
your membership cancellation.

1:22:43.926 --> 1:22:45.225
Sorry.

1:22:45.227 --> 1:22:46.827
Club policy.

1:22:46.829 --> 1:22:48.095
- Why are you doing this?

1:22:49.198 --> 1:22:51.031
Just who the fuck are you?

1:22:51.033 --> 1:22:53.934
- Liz Banning, meet Mr. White.

1:22:55.071 --> 1:22:56.236
And this is Mr. Black.

1:22:59.909 --> 1:23:00.808
I'm Hades.

1:23:05.881 --> 1:23:08.449
And this, is my face.

1:23:09.685 --> 1:23:11.585
Why did you come looking
for us Liz?

1:23:12.655 --> 1:23:15.356
Why do you think people
turn to suicide forums?

1:23:15.358 --> 1:23:19.793
Why is it that in today's
advanced, prosperous society,

1:23:19.795 --> 1:23:22.663
people get tired
and long for death?

1:23:22.665 --> 1:23:23.864
Have you ever wondered?

1:23:25.668 --> 1:23:28.902
It's because we have the
luxury of growing old.

1:23:30.740 --> 1:23:33.207
We age, but we don't live.

1:23:34.143 --> 1:23:35.409
We take everything for granted.

1:23:35.411 --> 1:23:36.310
We get bored.

1:23:38.381 --> 1:23:41.382
You came to us because you
wanted to die.

1:23:42.485 --> 1:23:43.884
We would've come for you.

1:23:43.886 --> 1:23:45.352
We would've given you peace.

1:23:46.522 --> 1:23:49.990
All you had to do
was name yourself.

1:23:51.527 --> 1:23:54.294
But when the opportunity of
an easy death came to you,

1:23:55.598 --> 1:23:57.698
you chose to end
another life instead.

1:23:58.868 --> 1:23:59.767
Why is that?

1:24:02.271 --> 1:24:03.570
It's because you felt it.

1:24:04.940 --> 1:24:07.141
You felt the spark ignite

1:24:08.244 --> 1:24:10.344
and that's what made you a
candidate Liz.

1:24:11.180 --> 1:24:12.446
We offered you a choice.

1:24:13.516 --> 1:24:16.950
Either sit back and watch
others take their life

1:24:16.952 --> 1:24:19.119
until you feel ready
to check out yourself

1:24:20.956 --> 1:24:21.855
or get involved.

1:24:23.759 --> 1:24:26.860
And you made your choice
just as we knew you would.

1:24:28.497 --> 1:24:32.566
We gave value to the very life
you were ready to throw away.

1:24:32.568 --> 1:24:35.235
- So that's the excuse
you tell yourself.

1:24:35.237 --> 1:24:37.271
Why on Earth do you
think I would join

1:24:37.273 --> 1:24:39.473
a sick bunch of fucks like you?

1:24:39.475 --> 1:24:42.476
- Now I'm glad you asked
because the very existence

1:24:42.478 --> 1:24:46.647
of our community hinges on the
reliability of its members,

1:24:46.649 --> 1:24:49.616
so we're very careful with
our selection process.

1:24:51.487 --> 1:24:54.521
We knew everything there
is to know about you.

1:24:54.523 --> 1:24:56.590
We knew we could count
on your discretion.

1:24:56.592 --> 1:25:00.994
We knew you had real potential,
it just needed to ignite.

1:25:02.965 --> 1:25:06.633
This renewed will to live is
what you owe us, Ms. Banning.

1:25:10.573 --> 1:25:14.241
You still have a choice.

1:25:19.014 --> 1:25:20.547
No sedation?

1:25:20.549 --> 1:25:22.082
Alright then,
let's get cracking.

1:25:22.084 --> 1:25:23.684
You know the game.

1:25:23.686 --> 1:25:24.985
(tense dramatic music)

1:25:24.987 --> 1:25:27.955
(punches thudding)

1:25:35.798 --> 1:25:36.930
- Let her go.

1:25:36.932 --> 1:25:37.898
Let her fucking go.

1:25:37.900 --> 1:25:38.899
- You're new to all this,
aren't you?

1:25:38.901 --> 1:25:40.601
He's not a member is he?

1:25:42.438 --> 1:25:45.506
Liz really should've explained
the rules of the game to you.

1:25:47.209 --> 1:25:49.743
I'm sorry, but we're
quite an exclusive club

1:25:49.745 --> 1:25:52.846
and unfortunately, we
can't allow non members

1:25:52.848 --> 1:25:54.848
to take part in our activities.

1:25:54.850 --> 1:25:56.250
As handsome as they may be.

1:25:57.419 --> 1:25:59.720
The police can't help you now.

1:25:59.722 --> 1:26:01.588
(ax thuds)

1:26:01.590 --> 1:26:04.224
(woman grunts)

1:26:09.632 --> 1:26:12.266
(Hades grunts)

1:26:18.707 --> 1:26:19.907
Come on Liz, do it.

1:26:19.909 --> 1:26:22.476
(punch thuds)

1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:26.213
(man exclaims)

1:26:26.215 --> 1:26:29.016
- On the website you have an
administrator's account, right?

1:26:29.018 --> 1:26:30.517
Tell me how to access it.

1:26:30.519 --> 1:26:33.220
- I'd much rather
you kill me Liz.

1:26:33.222 --> 1:26:34.054
- Here they come.

1:26:34.056 --> 1:26:34.888
Put in password.

1:26:34.890 --> 1:26:36.490
(ax thuds)

1:26:36.492 --> 1:26:37.491
Pull it up.

1:26:43.899 --> 1:26:46.400
(man grunts)

1:26:47.236 --> 1:26:49.570
(ax thuds)

1:27:04.086 --> 1:27:05.285
- Are you okay?

1:27:05.287 --> 1:27:06.620
- Yeah.

1:27:06.622 --> 1:27:07.521
Just about.

1:27:21.604 --> 1:27:22.736
(somber music)

1:27:22.738 --> 1:27:24.538
- [Liz] Hello
suicide club members.

1:27:25.641 --> 1:27:26.540
Are you watching?

1:27:28.344 --> 1:27:31.311
Whoever you are,
wherever you are.

1:27:31.313 --> 1:27:32.879
Thank you for playing.

1:27:32.881 --> 1:27:34.348
This will be our final message

1:27:34.350 --> 1:27:38.018
before this website indefinitely
ceases its activity.

1:27:38.020 --> 1:27:40.520
So shut your pc
and remember how life was

1:27:40.522 --> 1:27:42.589
before you came looking for us.

1:27:42.591 --> 1:27:45.659
Find that last spark
of will and start anew.

1:27:45.661 --> 1:27:46.927
Or don't.

1:27:46.929 --> 1:27:48.962
Live or die, it's your choice.

1:27:48.964 --> 1:27:51.064
No one can make it for you.

1:27:51.066 --> 1:27:53.900
And if you find yourself
missing us, don't worry.

1:27:53.902 --> 1:27:56.270
This is the only life you'll
ever get.

1:27:56.272 --> 1:27:58.038
That's the one thing we
guarantee.

1:28:01.343 --> 1:28:04.077
(hopeful music)

1:28:17.826 --> 1:28:22.896
¶ I'll miss the stars
when they're not around ¶

1:28:24.800 --> 1:28:29.870
¶ Too much light here
to take in ¶

1:28:31.607 --> 1:28:36.677
¶ Burns my eyes
with phosphorus tides ¶

1:28:38.447 --> 1:28:41.782
¶ Coming over in waves ¶

1:28:58.701 --> 1:29:03.770
¶ And though the room
is atramentous ¶

1:29:06.008 --> 1:29:11.078
¶ I still see those
diamonds eye ¶

1:29:13.015 --> 1:29:18.085
¶ Blue and greys to embrace ¶

1:29:19.688 --> 1:29:24.758
¶ I've seen what is real ¶

1:29:26.595 --> 1:29:31.665
