WEBVTT

00:00.345 --> 00:01.779
Previously on The Fosters...

00:02.113 --> 00:03.616
You need to make a bold move.

00:04.100 --> 00:05.504
You put your underwear in my pocket.

00:05.660 --> 00:07.611
I was, you know, flirting.

00:07.646 --> 00:08.879
So what you're just
like a tease, is that it?

00:08.914 --> 00:11.549
- No, I...
- Thanks for wasting my time.

00:11.583 --> 00:13.634
I see you've met Hurricane Dani.

00:13.668 --> 00:15.786
- You have a girlfriend?
- She's more like a sober buddy.

00:15.821 --> 00:16.987
I love you.

00:17.022 --> 00:20.825
If I have to wait a while, so
I'm gonna be with you again...

00:20.859 --> 00:23.690
Well, that's what I'm gonna do.

00:23.696 --> 00:27.898
I never realized until today
that for us to be together,

00:27.966 --> 00:30.701
you have to give up everything.

00:30.736 --> 00:33.504
Do you want to make some fast
bank? Why don't we sell some IDs?

00:33.538 --> 00:34.563
Isn't that like a felony?

00:34.564 --> 00:37.290
Your mom's a school veep.
You have access to her keys.

00:37.309 --> 00:39.643
We have access to the
idea maker at Anchor Beach.

00:43.648 --> 00:45.616
Ugh! I hate being late to school.

00:45.650 --> 00:46.834
Then stop hogging the bathroom.

00:46.868 --> 00:49.503
- Callie took longer than me.
- Yeah, that happened.

00:49.538 --> 00:52.957
And in other news, the laws of space
and time no longer apply in the bathroom.

00:55.660 --> 00:57.595
I don't care who's to blame.

00:57.629 --> 00:58.763
From now on, the car leaves at 7:30.

00:58.797 --> 01:01.498
Whoever's not in it can walk to school.

01:01.516 --> 01:02.600
I'm always ready.

01:02.634 --> 01:03.667
I know, honey, that's
why you're my favorite.

01:03.685 --> 01:06.554
- Hey!
- Go!

01:06.605 --> 01:10.921
Um, so was wondering would I be
able to go to Daphne's after school?

01:10.926 --> 01:13.627
Michelle at Girls United is taking Kiara

01:13.662 --> 01:16.597
and said she could pick
me up and bring me home.

01:16.631 --> 01:20.534
I don't think we're that
comfortable having you

01:20.569 --> 01:22.837
go to someone's apartment unsupervised.

01:22.871 --> 01:24.672
- What if they come to our house?
- Ok.

01:24.706 --> 01:27.691
I can see if they can come to me then.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074

01:36.952 --> 01:38.786
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:42.541 --> 01:46.460
Just one more day until weigh-in,
Foster. Do you have what it takes?

01:46.494 --> 01:49.547
Can you resist pastry perfection?

01:49.598 --> 01:51.766
You're gonna have to try a different trick.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.769
Or some better food.
I mean, scones, really?

01:54.803 --> 01:56.720
Yeah, really.

01:56.772 --> 01:59.690
And it's a family
recipe, have some respect.

01:59.724 --> 02:01.859
Eat away. Ice runs through these veins.

02:01.893 --> 02:04.779
- Ok, Ice Man. Hmm? Hmm?
- What are you...

02:04.813 --> 02:09.616
- Really? Really!
- Yep, yep.

02:13.688 --> 02:15.539
You have a girlfriend, you know?

02:15.574 --> 02:17.792
Thank you, Captain Obvious.
Emma's just a friend.

02:17.826 --> 02:19.827
That better be all she is.

02:30.755 --> 02:33.808
Thank you, again, so much for letting
Callie come back to Anchor Beach.

02:33.842 --> 02:36.477
I know the last thing you
need is more paperwork.

02:36.511 --> 02:38.646
Well, actually, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.848
I need to fill out a progress
report for Callie's P.O.

02:40.882 --> 02:43.651
She has been here every single day.

02:43.685 --> 02:45.586
He's looking for more than just attendance,

02:45.620 --> 02:48.689
and to be honest, I am, too.
She needs to participate.

02:48.723 --> 02:53.561
A club, sports, student
government, anything.

02:53.595 --> 02:56.564
Callie needs to show that she wants
to be a part of this community.

02:56.598 --> 02:59.466
I understand that, and we have spoken to
her about getting more involved in school.

02:59.501 --> 03:02.536
But not every kid is a joiner.

03:02.571 --> 03:04.738
And not every kid is a runaway, either.

03:04.773 --> 03:07.842
Look, I know you and Stef have
your hands full with five teenagers.

03:07.876 --> 03:09.576
We are managing.

03:09.594 --> 03:12.479
Mariana and Jesus have both
been suspended this year,

03:12.514 --> 03:14.748
and Jude barely passed
his proficiency test.

03:14.783 --> 03:19.553
- Brandon is the only one...
- That what, isn't a normal teenager?

03:19.588 --> 03:22.756
Everyone's kids make mistakes, Karina.

03:22.791 --> 03:25.893
Are mine supposed to be held to a
higher standard because I work here?

03:25.927 --> 03:27.761
Lena, that's not what I'm saying.

03:27.796 --> 03:30.831
- What are you saying?
- I want Callie to succeed here.

03:30.866 --> 03:32.733
I really do.

03:32.767 --> 03:35.703
And the more roots that she puts down,

03:35.737 --> 03:37.905
the harder they are to pull up,

03:37.939 --> 03:40.507
and the easier my paperwork gets.

03:40.542 --> 03:43.477
Oh. I forgot about the fire drill.

03:54.723 --> 03:55.839
I know the school's not really on fire,

03:55.891 --> 03:57.925
but the drill doesn't
work unless we pretend.

03:57.959 --> 04:00.761
Of course, Vice Principal. Going.

04:40.625 --> 04:43.964
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:49.694 --> 04:51.678
Hey. Did you get in? Did it work?

04:51.696 --> 04:53.897
We got a problem. Oh,
hell. We got two problems.

04:53.949 --> 04:55.899
A cop. Be cool.

04:55.951 --> 04:58.869
- Hey, B, how are you?
- Hey, Mom.

04:58.903 --> 05:01.388
What are you doing here?

05:01.423 --> 05:03.690
I'm having lunch with Mama. Hi.

05:03.708 --> 05:05.859
Uh... this is Vico.

05:05.877 --> 05:07.711
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

05:07.746 --> 05:09.413
Nice to meet you.

05:09.464 --> 05:11.632
Uh... class.

05:11.666 --> 05:14.668
- New friend?
- Nah, not really.

05:14.702 --> 05:16.804
- How are you? I miss you.
- I'm good.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.390
Come to have dinner with
us tomorrow at the house?

05:19.424 --> 05:22.843
I can't, actually. I have a
"getting to know you" thing with Dad

05:22.877 --> 05:25.712
- and his girlfriend, so...
- Your dad has a girlfriend?

05:25.730 --> 05:29.433
- That's nice. How long has that been going on?
- I don't know.

05:29.484 --> 05:31.685
It must be serious if he's
asking you to meet her, right?

05:31.719 --> 05:35.406
Well, we met before. We just haven't...

05:35.440 --> 05:37.691
Oh, I see. She's been by the apartment.

05:37.726 --> 05:39.727
- Is she spending the night there?
- Mom, I don't...

05:39.761 --> 05:41.528
No, no, B, listen.

05:41.563 --> 05:42.796
You're living with your dad,

05:42.831 --> 05:44.765
and I just want to make sure

05:44.799 --> 05:47.801
that it's a healthy environment.

05:47.836 --> 05:49.569
- I'm not gonna get in the middle of this.
- Ok.

05:49.587 --> 05:52.573
So if you wanna know about
dad's girlfriend, ask him.

05:52.607 --> 05:54.875
- Will do. How old is she?
- Ok.

05:54.909 --> 05:57.428
- Mom.
- What, is she 30? At least?

05:57.462 --> 05:59.763
- Come on. Love you.
- I love you.

06:01.516 --> 06:02.649
You know, it just...

06:02.684 --> 06:04.651
it's hard enough with Brandon
not living under our roof.

06:04.686 --> 06:09.423
His father has got girls going in and out,

06:09.457 --> 06:12.459
- and coming and going.
- One girl. One girl.

06:12.494 --> 06:15.396
- Remember the pet psychic?
- Oh, God. She was young.

06:15.430 --> 06:17.865
Yeah, she said that our cat used
to be Cleopatra in a former life.

06:17.899 --> 06:20.667
- Remember that?
- I forgot about that.

06:20.702 --> 06:22.770
Mmm, here's one.

06:22.804 --> 06:25.406
"African-American, six foot,

06:25.440 --> 06:27.574
Masters in poetry. Loves dogs."

06:27.609 --> 06:29.743
You know, if she's gonna be
spending the night at the apartment,

06:29.777 --> 06:32.463
exactly what kind of an example
is that setting for Brandon?

06:32.497 --> 06:33.614
We should definitely meet her.

06:33.648 --> 06:35.449
African-American?

06:35.483 --> 06:37.618
Well...

06:37.652 --> 06:39.686
- Yeah...
- No, I just...

06:39.721 --> 06:42.790
You know, if we're... can't
have the baby together,

06:42.824 --> 06:45.459
just that maybe I thought
we could find a donor

06:45.493 --> 06:48.829
that has more of my characteristics.

06:48.863 --> 06:52.833
- You mean white?
- And smart and loyal and charming

06:52.867 --> 06:54.802
and sweet and loving and caring.

06:54.836 --> 06:58.439
See, the thing is that I'm half white

06:58.473 --> 06:59.740
so if we go with a donor who's also white,

06:59.774 --> 07:02.709
then the baby might not end
up looking like me at all.

07:02.744 --> 07:05.379
No, no, no, I get it. I get it. I get it.

07:05.413 --> 07:07.581
It's just it's going to be our baby.

07:07.615 --> 07:10.451
And that's fine. That's all that matters.

07:10.485 --> 07:11.618
It doesn't have to look like me

07:11.653 --> 07:13.587
so African-American it is. Totally.

07:13.621 --> 07:14.838
Let's do this.

07:23.431 --> 07:25.382
Hey, friend.

07:25.433 --> 07:26.800
Hey, pal.

07:28.853 --> 07:31.505
So do we...

07:31.539 --> 07:32.706
should we eat lunch together?

07:32.740 --> 07:34.675
I don't know.

07:34.709 --> 07:36.543
That kind of seems like
advanced-level friendship.

07:39.447 --> 07:42.549
- Well, it was a good effort.
- Yeah, baby steps.

07:44.719 --> 07:45.719
Boom.

07:48.706 --> 07:50.624
I can't believe Kelsey got
the friends in our break-up.

07:50.658 --> 07:53.627
It's 'cause they're scared of her, right?

07:53.661 --> 07:55.462
Yeah. I don't blame them She's scary.

07:55.497 --> 07:58.699
Meanwhile, Zac's acting like I set his
lighting plans on fire or something,

07:58.733 --> 08:01.668
which is lame. He's the one
who left me at the cast party.

08:01.703 --> 08:04.638
Yeah, he left because he
thought you two were on a date.

08:04.672 --> 08:08.375
No, we're just... you came with us.

08:08.393 --> 08:10.477
Yeah, he wasn't too happy about that.

08:12.881 --> 08:14.748
- Oh, no.
- What?

08:14.782 --> 08:18.569
Zac was there, when Chase
went upstairs, after I...

08:19.721 --> 08:22.589
After I put my underwear in Chase's pocket.

08:22.624 --> 08:25.609
Wait! You did what?

08:25.660 --> 08:26.726
I don't wanna talk about it.

08:26.744 --> 08:29.413
Look, and the whole time, I was on a date,

08:29.447 --> 08:31.565
- with Zac.
- Yeah.

08:31.583 --> 08:32.732
A pretty bad one.

08:39.573 --> 08:41.758
Hey. What happened? Did you get caught?

08:41.793 --> 08:43.594
No, there was an alarm.

08:43.628 --> 08:45.746
It wasn't on today, but
it will be after hours.

08:45.780 --> 08:48.432
So we're screwed?

08:48.466 --> 08:50.884
Unless you can get the code.

08:50.919 --> 08:52.819
Sure. I'll ask my mom.

08:52.854 --> 08:54.655
She's gotta have it written
down somewhere, right?

08:57.725 --> 09:00.594
It's worth it, dude. The
machine works like a charm.

09:02.397 --> 09:04.565
Ok. I'll see what I can do.

09:04.599 --> 09:05.897
You got huevos, Foster.

09:06.252 --> 09:08.035
With a cop and a vice principal for a mom.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.476
It's only a one-time thing.

09:09.477 --> 09:11.462
Once I get the money I need, I'm out.

09:11.673 --> 09:14.408
Totally. But first things first.

09:14.442 --> 09:15.709
We're putting that bad boy to the test.

09:15.743 --> 09:18.679
We're hitting the bars tonight.

09:25.753 --> 09:27.387
Zac.

09:27.422 --> 09:29.556
I have a newspaper meeting, like now, so...

09:29.591 --> 09:33.594
I'm sorry. For the
misunderstanding at the cast party.

09:33.628 --> 09:35.829
I didn't know that you thought
we were together together.

09:35.863 --> 09:37.764
I didn't think that.

09:37.799 --> 09:40.467
- You didn't?
- No.

09:40.501 --> 09:43.804
We worked on the play together,
we went to the party as friends.

09:43.838 --> 09:45.856
Oh. Good. Ok.

09:45.907 --> 09:47.874
So we're ok?

09:47.909 --> 09:50.677
No.

09:50.712 --> 09:53.614
You don't ditch a friend to go
hook-up with some no-talent toolbox.

09:53.648 --> 09:56.617
- Ok, I did not hook up with Chase.
- Whatever, Mariana,

09:56.651 --> 09:58.852
don't worry about it. The play's
over. We don't need to be friends.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.268
- You told people?
- What are you talking about?

10:20.303 --> 10:23.121
The pant... the panties.

10:23.172 --> 10:24.172
What? No.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.041
Is this because I didn't hook up with you?

10:26.075 --> 10:29.010
Look, it wasn't me. You
must have told someone.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.247
Or somebody saw you. You
weren't exactly stealth about it.

10:32.281 --> 10:36.051
No, you're lying. You know
how I know you're lying?

10:36.085 --> 10:38.086
Because you're a terrible actor.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.976
Hey! Come in.

10:45.027 --> 10:46.261
Hi.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.865
Dang! Look at you.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.199
She cleans up good, doesn't she?

10:51.234 --> 10:53.235
My P.O. makes me wear this for interviews.

10:53.269 --> 10:56.104
- Feel like I'm in a Halloween costume.
- So how'd it go?

10:56.138 --> 10:58.173
We'll see.

10:58.207 --> 11:00.876
Well, thanks for coming to me.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.979
I can only be here or at school, so...

11:04.013 --> 11:05.280
It's kind of like I
never left Girls United.

11:05.314 --> 11:08.884
Ain't nothing about this
place like Girls United.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.051
You ran away from here?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.187
Um, you guys want some food?

11:12.221 --> 11:14.289
I can, like, make us
sandwiches or something.

11:14.323 --> 11:17.859
Just glad I'm not eating ramen.

11:17.894 --> 11:20.228
So how is independent living?

11:20.263 --> 11:23.265
It's a challenge. They don't
pay enough to cover my bills.

11:23.299 --> 11:25.300
No one's trying to hire a kid out of juvie,

11:25.334 --> 11:28.036
no matter how many recommendation
letters Rita or Michelle write.

11:28.070 --> 11:30.005
And they won't give you
Tasha back without a job?

11:30.039 --> 11:33.108
I get a supervised
visit with her next week.

11:33.142 --> 11:36.978
Yeah. I want to buy her this tricycle,
like the one I had when I was kid.

11:36.996 --> 11:39.047
So she won't forget me while
I'm trying to get her back.

11:39.081 --> 11:41.950
That's why I need a job.

11:41.984 --> 11:43.168
So what's up with you?

11:43.202 --> 11:45.837
Um, you know.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.289
No, we don't know.

11:47.323 --> 11:51.927
It's all good. I'm supposed
to be making friends

11:51.961 --> 11:53.328
and joining clubs, I guess.

11:53.362 --> 11:55.330
I don't really have anything in common

11:55.364 --> 11:57.332
with the kids I go to school with, so...

11:57.366 --> 12:01.169
You didn't have much in common with
us, either, but we're all friends.

12:01.203 --> 12:04.072
- And Brandon?
- Not an issue.

12:04.106 --> 12:07.175
- He moved in with his dad.
- Not an issue?

12:07.209 --> 12:11.246
He's everywhere you look,
and you're in school with him.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.015
Yeah, no, Brandon and me, we're good.

12:14.050 --> 12:17.886
Well, Kiara has some good news.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.921
Mmm, mmm, mmm...

12:19.956 --> 12:22.924
- I got me a foster family.
- What?

12:22.959 --> 12:25.877
Yeah. All because of you.

12:25.912 --> 12:29.197
That picture you took of me in photography
class, they used it on the website.

12:29.231 --> 12:31.866
Um,  it's just a picture.

12:31.901 --> 12:33.969
No, your pictures are different.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.004
They're more real.

12:36.038 --> 12:39.874
Your picture brought out
all of my inner beauty.

12:41.894 --> 12:44.980
The pictures CPS takes of us makes
us all look like dogs at the pound.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.149
Well, hello, ladies.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.919
- Hi, Mrs. Foster.
- Hi.

12:50.953 --> 12:52.904
Go ahead and call me Stef, all right?

12:52.939 --> 12:56.157
Glad that you guys could come
and visit. That's wonderful.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.275
You want anything else?

12:57.326 --> 12:59.227
No, thanks.

12:59.245 --> 13:03.198
Well, if you change your mind,
just help yourself, right?

13:03.232 --> 13:05.066
Michelle's gonna pick us up at any moment.

13:05.101 --> 13:08.954
So we should probably wait for her. Thanks.

13:09.005 --> 13:11.806
Yeah, I'm gonna walk you out
so I can say hi to Michelle.

13:11.841 --> 13:14.209
Thanks, Mrs... Stef.

13:14.276 --> 13:16.211
You're welcome. Bye.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.899
What'd I tell you, man?
These things are golden.

13:37.933 --> 13:40.118
Fine, we got past the doors, but
what if someone else figures us out?

13:40.152 --> 13:42.871
- We could get arrested.
- No one is getting arrested.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.907
I'll have a Rusty Nail.

13:45.941 --> 13:49.044
Yeah, I'll have a Cosmopolitan?

13:49.078 --> 13:52.981
- Well or shelf?
- What do you recommend?

13:53.015 --> 13:56.251
- Top shelf.
- You know what is gonna get us busted?

13:56.285 --> 13:58.319
You standing there looking
all uptight and guilty.

13:58.354 --> 14:00.188
Hell, I'm about to arrest you.

14:00.222 --> 14:02.190
Our IDs kick ass.

14:02.224 --> 14:05.160
Enjoy this moment.

14:05.194 --> 14:07.929
- Yeah, you're right.
- Good.

14:07.963 --> 14:11.900
So why did you need the money so fast?

14:11.934 --> 14:14.035
Long story.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.871
Bars were invented for long stories.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.913
Nice. It's like drinking
with my little sister.

14:30.186 --> 14:33.922
- $12?
- Top shelf, bro.

14:35.324 --> 14:39.894
So I meant to tell you about the
conversation I had with Karina today

14:39.929 --> 14:43.098
about how we have our hands
full with all these kids.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.265
Yeah, well, we do.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.052
Her tone was more critical than concerned.

14:47.103 --> 14:48.903
They have been getting into some trouble.

14:48.938 --> 14:50.939
What else did she have to say?

14:50.973 --> 14:54.008
She has to do Callie's
progress reports for her P.O.

14:54.043 --> 14:55.844
and she really thinks that Callie should be

14:55.878 --> 14:57.212
getting more engaged in school.

14:57.246 --> 14:59.948
Ok, should we be concerned
she's spending so much time

14:59.982 --> 15:02.884
- with Daphne and Kiara?
- Why, 'cause they're juvenile delinquents?

15:02.918 --> 15:04.819
Well, because she's not
making friends at Anchor Beach.

15:04.854 --> 15:07.055
- But now that you mention it.
- They're good girls.

15:07.089 --> 15:10.859
Yeah, at heart, but they do have
a history of drugs and gangs.

15:10.893 --> 15:13.094
The rate of recidivism
with girls like them...

15:13.129 --> 15:15.930
Callie is a girl like them.

15:20.052 --> 15:22.887
- Hey.
- Need some help?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.205
I think we're good, thanks.

15:24.223 --> 15:27.175
Um, I took a picture of Kiara
while I was at Girls United

15:27.243 --> 15:31.146
and I guess it helped
her find a foster family.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.014
That's wonderful.

15:33.048 --> 15:35.183
Yeah, so I was thinking

15:35.217 --> 15:39.104
maybe I could do that for other
kids that need foster homes.

15:39.155 --> 15:42.257
Take pictures, I mean.
So I can talk to my P.O.,

15:42.291 --> 15:45.293
and see if it would count towards
my community service hours.

15:45.327 --> 15:50.098
And maybe I could use
the photo lab at school?

15:50.132 --> 15:52.033
Great. I think that can be arranged.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.171
Yeah, maybe you can ask some of
your classmates for some help.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.306
Or make some new friends.

15:58.340 --> 16:00.909
I was actually

16:00.943 --> 16:03.945
gonna have Daphne and Kiara help me out,

16:03.979 --> 16:06.981
- just for their hours, too.
- Ok, that makes sense.

16:07.016 --> 16:10.852
But Principal Sanchez would really like
to see you getting more involved in school.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.121
Yeah, and we would, too.

16:13.155 --> 16:16.257
I will try.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.062
Well, she wants to do it at school.

16:21.096 --> 16:24.265
- That's a step in the right direction, right?
- Yeah.

16:27.970 --> 16:29.937
All right, let me guess.

16:31.974 --> 16:34.943
Huge gambling debt. And if
you don't get the money ASAP,

16:34.977 --> 16:36.211
a bookie's gonna come break your legs.

16:38.848 --> 16:41.082
Or you're a male prostitute
on the run from your pimp.

16:43.085 --> 16:46.087
You caught me.

16:46.121 --> 16:50.024
No, I owe it to my dad, actually.

16:50.059 --> 16:54.996
He was giving it to me for my
piano lessons, and I quit going.

16:55.030 --> 16:56.231
So you just pocketed it?

16:56.265 --> 17:00.835
Well, I was saving it for Callie.

17:02.154 --> 17:04.805
So you're willing to
break bad for the girl.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.907
You must be in love.

17:09.044 --> 17:11.079
You know what? Forget I told you.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.117
So what, she took the money
and ran off with Wyatt?

17:17.152 --> 17:18.920
No.

17:21.022 --> 17:22.957
I used it for something else.

17:22.992 --> 17:26.928
And now I have to pay my
dad back before he finds out.

17:26.962 --> 17:30.865
He's just been going through
a lot of stuff lately.

17:30.900 --> 17:34.836
And I just don't want to
stress him out anymore.

17:34.870 --> 17:36.905
You're a good man, Charlie Brown.

17:36.939 --> 17:38.172
You're an ass.

17:38.207 --> 17:40.174
Is that any way to talk to your wingman?

17:46.215 --> 17:48.283
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting you laid, bro.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.853
Best thing for a broken heart. Let's go.

18:03.048 --> 18:04.865
- I gotta go.
- Don't be a wuss.

18:04.883 --> 18:05.967
No, I gotta go.

18:20.336 --> 18:22.337
I missed breakfast?

18:22.371 --> 18:23.371
You had to work.

18:25.441 --> 18:29.076
All right, when I go back to my
regular schedule, it's me, you

18:29.094 --> 18:32.297
and pancakes every
morning, just like Mom's.

18:33.482 --> 18:37.302
Or you know, cereal. But together.

18:38.454 --> 18:41.022
Uh, so you know that
dinner with Dani tonight?

18:41.056 --> 18:45.226
It's been moved... yeah, to Mom's house.

18:45.294 --> 18:48.129
Apparently, someone told
her I had a girlfriend.

18:48.164 --> 18:51.232
Oh. Right, I'm sorry.

18:54.036 --> 18:56.037
So, um...

18:56.071 --> 18:58.173
how long has Dani been sober?

18:58.207 --> 19:00.341
Five years. Why?

19:00.376 --> 19:03.211
Are you...

19:03.245 --> 19:06.014
I mean,

19:06.048 --> 19:09.017
do you worry about
dating another alcoholic?

19:10.152 --> 19:13.221
I mean, like, if she were
to start drinking again,

19:13.255 --> 19:16.124
would that maybe make you wanna...

19:16.158 --> 19:19.126
Brandon, I appreciate the concern.

19:19.144 --> 19:21.996
But she's a rock, ok?

19:23.199 --> 19:26.134
Look, I know I've given you
reason to worry in the past,

19:26.168 --> 19:29.971
but my sobriety is not
tied into anyone else's.

19:30.005 --> 19:33.041
Ok?

19:33.125 --> 19:34.225
Ok.

19:34.260 --> 19:37.128
I'm in a good place.

19:38.497 --> 19:40.098
All right.

19:41.166 --> 19:45.303
Oh, I called your piano teacher.

19:45.337 --> 19:47.138
- When?
- Last week.

19:47.172 --> 19:50.141
And when he calls me back, I'm
gonna tell him to save you a spot.

19:50.175 --> 19:52.243
The spot's long gone.
He has a waiting list.

19:52.278 --> 19:55.313
So I sweet-talked him once,
who's to say I can't do it again?

19:55.347 --> 19:58.149
I just don't want to take from him, ok?

19:58.183 --> 20:01.219
I'm still playing piano, so...

20:01.253 --> 20:03.154
He was kind of a pompous ass anyway.

20:03.188 --> 20:08.259
So just don't call him again.

20:10.496 --> 20:12.430
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

20:15.301 --> 20:18.169
- Ok.
- All right.

20:27.296 --> 20:29.547
How is it possible you
got scrawnier, Foster?

20:29.581 --> 20:34.102
- You get dumber every day, so...
- Torched!

20:34.136 --> 20:35.553
Jesus, you're up.

20:42.194 --> 20:46.097
Oh, down a class. Looks like someone's
getting himself off the bench.

20:47.366 --> 20:49.100
Never doubted it for a moment.

20:49.118 --> 20:51.402
- Thanks for your support.
- Emma, you're up.

20:57.509 --> 21:00.378
Whoa, would you look at
that? I take it back, Foster.

21:00.412 --> 21:02.480
Emma gained. Now you're in the same class.

21:02.514 --> 21:05.316
Looks like we're gonna have
a wrestle-off this afternoon.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.468
Torched!

21:10.288 --> 21:12.306
Vico, step up to the plate.

21:14.093 --> 21:17.128
I was just on my way
to see you with a gift.

21:18.313 --> 21:20.398
Actually, more of a bribe, truth be told.

21:20.432 --> 21:25.236
Ok, what exactly are you hoping to get in
exchange for this delectable baked good?

21:25.270 --> 21:28.072
I was wondering if it's possible
that I take some of the props

21:28.107 --> 21:30.491
from the drama club this weekend
to the nursing home with me.

21:30.526 --> 21:33.494
The nursing home? Are you moving in?

21:33.529 --> 21:35.279
No.

21:35.313 --> 21:38.166
I direct the residents in
productions of Shakespeare.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.333
This weekend's our performance.

21:39.368 --> 21:42.553
Well, of course. Take whatever you need.

21:42.588 --> 21:46.124
How did I not know this, that you're
doing Shakespeare in a nursing home?

21:46.158 --> 21:49.260
I don't know. I've been
doing it a long time,

21:49.294 --> 21:51.562
so I never thought to mention it, I guess.

21:51.597 --> 21:54.499
That's amazing, Timothy.

21:54.533 --> 21:56.200
I'm very impressed.

21:56.235 --> 22:00.037
Well, you needn't be, but thank you.

22:00.072 --> 22:02.390
And the Sunshine Valley Home for the Aged

22:02.441 --> 22:06.444
production of Coriolanus
thanks you as well.

22:12.117 --> 22:15.520
She didn't "like" my pic, so I was
all, "Wish yourself a happy birthday."

22:15.554 --> 22:18.189
Ugh, just unfollow her already.

22:18.223 --> 22:21.159
I know, but then it's weird 'cause
it's like when does she notice,

22:21.193 --> 22:23.527
and when she does, does
she think it's an accident?

22:24.529 --> 22:26.164
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:26.198 --> 22:28.249
Hey. I'm Callie.

22:28.300 --> 22:31.302
We know. We're friends with Talya.

22:34.372 --> 22:36.507
This place is so high school.

22:36.586 --> 22:40.389
I know. I feel like
everybody's talking about me.

22:40.423 --> 22:42.141
Who cares?

22:42.192 --> 22:44.393
Everyone thinks that I
stole Brandon from Talya.

22:44.427 --> 22:47.563
Well, you kind of did steal
from Brandon from Talya.

22:47.597 --> 22:51.300
Right, and you kind of did put
your underwear in Chase's pocket.

22:51.335 --> 22:54.370
Anyway, I know it's embarrassing,

22:54.404 --> 22:57.273
but in the scheme of things to worry about,

22:57.307 --> 23:01.077
what these people think of
you, it's not one of them.

23:01.478 --> 23:02.545
You're right.

23:18.512 --> 23:20.096
What's going on here?

23:22.615 --> 23:25.261
Mariana, would you please open your eyes?

23:25.319 --> 23:26.953
No. Because if I do,

23:26.987 --> 23:29.255
then I have to acknowledge
that this is actually happening.

23:29.290 --> 23:33.326
Look, honey, we just want
to talk to you about...

23:33.361 --> 23:36.229
the right ways to let a
boy know that you like him.

23:36.263 --> 23:38.231
Oh, my God, please don't do this.

23:38.265 --> 23:41.334
Sorry, but this is important, Mariana.

23:41.369 --> 23:45.338
All right? We don't want anyone
to get the wrong impression.

23:45.373 --> 23:49.342
You don't... that's what it
was, the wrong impression?

23:49.377 --> 23:52.025
- Yes, nothing happened.
- Ok.

23:52.029 --> 23:55.065
Mariana, where did you
even get such a crazy idea?

23:55.099 --> 23:58.935
Talya. She used it on... never mind.

24:00.287 --> 24:02.238
Yes, please, stop there.

24:02.273 --> 24:04.040
Look, I just...

24:04.075 --> 24:06.993
no one would believe that a
boy like Chase would like me.

24:07.044 --> 24:09.079
I just... I wanted to prove them wrong.

24:09.113 --> 24:11.214
- Mariana.
- Honey,

24:11.248 --> 24:15.284
trust me one day soon,
much too soon for us,

24:15.302 --> 24:17.253
the right boy is gonna want to be with you.

24:17.288 --> 24:19.289
Yeah, that's what everybody old says.

24:19.323 --> 24:22.292
Yes, and you should listen
to them because they are wise,

24:22.326 --> 24:24.994
and by the way, not that old.

24:25.029 --> 24:26.329
Beat it.

24:28.132 --> 24:31.234
Whatever happened to do you
like me, circle yes or no?

24:31.268 --> 24:34.971
By the way, I invited Brandon
and Mike over for dinner tonight.

24:34.989 --> 24:36.206
What? You did?

24:36.240 --> 24:39.159
Yeah, and Mike's new girlfriend.
I told you this yesterday.

24:39.193 --> 24:42.879
No, honey, just because you think something,
doesn't mean you ever said it out loud.

24:42.913 --> 24:44.114
Ok, then I'm telling you now.

24:44.148 --> 24:45.949
I've invited Brandon and Mike

24:45.983 --> 24:47.299
and Mike's new girlfriend over for dinner.

24:47.318 --> 24:49.520
- You said that we should met her.
- I agree.

24:49.554 --> 24:52.623
I think that's great, but I
invited Timothy over for dinner.

24:52.657 --> 24:55.259
Timothy? Well, then you can reschedule.

24:55.293 --> 24:56.593
- Come on.
- Why should I reschedule?

24:56.628 --> 24:58.629
Because we know that Timothy
is not going to turn out

24:58.663 --> 25:03.467
to be a 20-year-old hussy who might
someday be our son's stepmother.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.469
It's too late. It'd be rude.

25:05.503 --> 25:09.406
Well, fine. Then we're
having a dinner party. Whoo!

25:09.424 --> 25:11.575
Let's break out the hummus.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.464
Graffiti is a crime, you know?

25:17.645 --> 25:20.430
Ha-ha. No, it's, um...

25:22.784 --> 25:27.521
This is you taking the photos?

25:27.555 --> 25:28.722
- That's pretty awesome.
- Yeah, um...

25:28.756 --> 25:31.425
Michelle is bringing some
of kids from Girls United.

25:31.459 --> 25:34.561
She's put the word out to other
homes, as well, so hopefully,

25:34.579 --> 25:35.796
it'll be a good turnout.

25:37.832 --> 25:39.800
I wanna help them.

25:39.834 --> 25:42.469
And I have to for community service, so...

25:43.771 --> 25:45.672
- They're just letting you use the school?
- Yeah.

25:45.707 --> 25:49.609
Lena's gonna come and
get me and lock up after.

25:49.644 --> 25:52.779
Cool. You're a really good person.

25:56.451 --> 25:58.769
Two men enter, one man leaves!

25:58.803 --> 26:01.555
Two men enter, one man leaves!

26:01.589 --> 26:03.724
Two men enter, one man leaves! Whoo!

26:03.758 --> 26:05.642
Shake hands.

26:05.693 --> 26:08.445
Guess you shouldn't have
eaten all those scones.

26:58.479 --> 26:59.746
Congrats, Emma.

27:04.619 --> 27:07.621
Hey, Foster, the bench
isn't gonna warm itself.

27:10.758 --> 27:13.427
Nice move. You deserve it.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.635
Hey! Hey!

27:21.669 --> 27:23.637
Why are you mad? You won.

27:23.671 --> 27:27.541
It's how I won. You saw me as a girl.

27:27.575 --> 27:29.409
You think I let you win
because you're a girl?

27:29.444 --> 27:31.845
- No, I think I won because it got weird.
- It wasn't just me.

27:31.879 --> 27:35.449
I have busted my ass,
worked a hundred times harder

27:35.483 --> 27:36.783
than any of you guys to be on this team.

27:36.818 --> 27:38.385
I know you have.

27:38.419 --> 27:41.555
On that mat, I'm not a girl.

27:41.589 --> 27:44.491
Fine, you're not a girl.

27:53.584 --> 27:54.801
God, you make me mad.

28:06.356 --> 28:09.375
Damn, y'all. This school is fancy.

28:09.409 --> 28:12.161
Right? Yeah, it's way nicer than the ones

28:12.195 --> 28:14.463
Jude and I grew up going to.

28:14.497 --> 28:16.265
Hey, how's Daphne doing?

28:16.299 --> 28:18.434
It's rough. I'm worried about her.

28:18.468 --> 28:21.070
Yeah, me, too. Does Rita know?

28:21.137 --> 28:24.073
They check in on her, but you
see that brave face she puts on

28:24.107 --> 28:26.208
- like she don't need no help.
- She's gonna go back to the gang

28:26.242 --> 28:30.346
- if she doesn't get Tasha back.
- I hear you.

28:30.380 --> 28:32.381
You think she's gonna show?

28:32.399 --> 28:34.249
I hope so.

28:38.488 --> 28:41.190
Hi. I was going to bring dessert

28:41.224 --> 28:43.492
but I'm a terrible cook, so...

28:43.526 --> 28:45.427
I doubt you're terrible at anything.

28:45.462 --> 28:48.397
But thank you so much.
It was so, so kind of you.

28:48.415 --> 28:52.117
Stef, this is my
brilliant coworker Timothy.

28:52.168 --> 28:53.402
Yes, we've met before, honey.

28:53.436 --> 28:55.287
- Hi, Stef.
- Hi, how are you?

28:55.338 --> 28:56.438
Good too see you.

28:56.473 --> 28:59.408
- Thank you.
- Oh.

28:59.426 --> 29:02.077
Hi, come on in. You must be Dani.

29:02.095 --> 29:05.080
You must be Stef. Thanks
so much for having us over.

29:05.098 --> 29:07.266
I've heard so much about all of you.

29:07.300 --> 29:09.969
- I wish we could say the same...
- You promised.

29:10.020 --> 29:13.022
Well, why don't out of the
doorway, shall we? Dinner's ready.

29:13.056 --> 29:15.107
Yes, come on. Come sit down.

29:15.141 --> 29:17.393
Mike and Dani, why don't you
come sit over here next to me?

29:17.427 --> 29:19.428
Don't you wanna sit next to your wife?

29:19.462 --> 29:21.296
I eat dinner with her every night.

29:21.331 --> 29:24.233
No, actually, Stef, I thought you
could sit over here next to Timothy.

29:24.267 --> 29:27.286
Uh... I thought Brandon could sit there.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.138
No, no, Brandon could just sit right here.

29:29.172 --> 29:31.040
Why don't I just move down
one, and then Brandon could...

29:31.074 --> 29:35.210
No, you're a guest, you can sit
wherever you like. Stef, just...

29:35.245 --> 29:37.997
Right here. Right there.

29:55.198 --> 29:56.432
Beautiful!

29:56.466 --> 29:59.435
Oh, so cute!

29:59.469 --> 30:03.205
Yeah, back to back. Like it.

30:03.239 --> 30:05.324
Your models are here.

30:05.358 --> 30:09.111
- No way!
- Hey, you!

30:09.145 --> 30:11.113
Oh, my gosh, hi.

30:11.147 --> 30:13.198
Aww, hey, honey. Oh!

30:13.249 --> 30:15.250
I love that you're doing this.

30:15.285 --> 30:17.352
And I heard back from some people,

30:17.387 --> 30:20.122
and we should have kids from
at least two other homes.

30:20.156 --> 30:23.225
Oh, uh, this is my roommate, Monica.

30:23.259 --> 30:26.195
This is the one I told you about.
The notorious sandwich thief.

30:26.229 --> 30:28.197
Seriously. Don't listen to him.

30:28.231 --> 30:29.431
Really. If he gets on your nerves,

30:29.466 --> 30:32.167
just tell him to listen to
The Smiths. Works every time.

30:32.202 --> 30:33.535
- Yeah, whatever.
- Quit it you two.

30:33.570 --> 30:36.522
- Let the new girl get her picture
taken. - Sign-in is over here.

30:40.226 --> 30:41.276
His parents won't take him back.

30:41.311 --> 30:43.545
So he's looking for a foster home.

30:43.580 --> 30:46.065
One that'll take in a transgender kid?

30:46.116 --> 30:49.118
You best take some good pictures.

30:49.152 --> 30:51.403
Took you long enough. You were
supposed to help us set up.

30:51.454 --> 30:53.372
You know how many buses
I had to take to get here?

30:53.406 --> 30:55.290
You put your cornrows back in.

30:55.325 --> 30:57.025
Yeah.

30:57.060 --> 30:58.160
So did you hear about the job?

30:58.194 --> 30:59.461
Didn't get it.

30:59.496 --> 31:01.263
You'll get the next one.

31:02.532 --> 31:04.416
I didn't know they had
schools on the beach.

31:04.467 --> 31:06.301
This is like one of them resorts in Mexico.

31:06.336 --> 31:08.303
What, they give you a piña
colada with your homework?

31:08.338 --> 31:10.055
Come on, let's get started.

31:18.381 --> 31:21.116
Yes, I love that.

31:21.151 --> 31:23.485
Ok, and just, um, look over here.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.187
Yeah.

31:30.527 --> 31:34.496
Do you see that boy over there?
That's actually my little brother.

31:34.531 --> 31:37.232
Hey, Jude. Come meet a friend of mine.

31:39.169 --> 31:40.119
Hi.

31:41.304 --> 31:44.406
Perfect! Thanks for the assist.

31:44.440 --> 31:48.210
I'm here for you, but I think
someone oughta take your picture.

31:48.244 --> 31:50.095
No. Jude, stop it.

31:50.130 --> 31:52.147
I'm serious. Stop it.

31:52.182 --> 31:55.083
- Daphne, save me.
- No, no, no, no.

31:55.118 --> 31:57.436
I am no one's human shield, girl.

31:57.470 --> 32:01.106
- Where's the girls room?
- It's down the hall and to the left.

32:01.141 --> 32:05.194
Wait. Just in case it's locked.

32:06.129 --> 32:09.064
Out. Go!

32:09.098 --> 32:13.118
- This looks amazing.
- Thank you.

32:13.153 --> 32:15.370
Hey, bud. Where you been?

32:15.405 --> 32:18.473
Sorry, studying. Lost track of time.

32:18.508 --> 32:23.162
No doubt grappling with the motifs
of guilt and deception in Hamlet.

32:23.213 --> 32:24.413
Timothy was a Rhodes Scholar.

32:24.447 --> 32:28.116
- Well, that's impressive.
- It's really not a big deal.

32:28.151 --> 32:30.052
No, it's a huge deal.

32:30.086 --> 32:32.521
It recognizes academic
achievement and character

32:32.555 --> 32:35.157
- and leadership ability.
- Or in my case,

32:35.191 --> 32:36.325
an ability to write an essay that swindled

32:36.359 --> 32:38.327
a committee to believe I had all that.

32:44.300 --> 32:46.134
None for me, thanks.

32:46.152 --> 32:47.402
I'm sober.

32:47.437 --> 32:49.104
Oh, you're in the program, too?

32:49.138 --> 32:52.357
Five years. That's actually how I met Mike.

32:54.043 --> 32:55.077
They're sober buddies.

32:55.111 --> 32:58.146
Are sober buddies allowed
to date each other?

32:58.181 --> 33:00.015
Yes, if they're consenting adults.

33:00.049 --> 33:03.218
You know, Bill Clinton was
a Rhodes Scholar, as well,

33:03.253 --> 33:05.320
- I believe, wasn't he?
- Uh, yeah.

33:05.355 --> 33:08.323
- So what do you do, Dani?
- I'm a dog walker.

33:08.358 --> 33:11.226
A business owner actually.

33:11.261 --> 33:15.030
She has five employees
and what, over 100 clients?

33:15.064 --> 33:17.266
Timothy is an animal lover.

33:18.268 --> 33:20.035
Big time.

33:21.237 --> 33:23.205
Maybe I should date Timothy.

33:30.313 --> 33:32.281
What is going on in there?

33:32.315 --> 33:34.516
I'm trying to figure out if that
woman is a good influence on our son

33:34.534 --> 33:38.387
and all you're talking about is Timothy.

33:38.421 --> 33:41.256
All right. I have been thinking

33:41.291 --> 33:45.093
maybe we shouldn't go with
an anonymous sperm donor.

33:45.128 --> 33:47.529
Maybe we should ask Timothy.

33:52.368 --> 33:54.269
Ok, maybe you should ask me first.

33:54.304 --> 33:58.140
I wanted you to get to know
Timothy better without the pressure

33:58.174 --> 34:00.475
of, you know, thinking of him like that.

34:00.510 --> 34:03.345
Well, if you had talked to me first,
then maybe I could have saved you the trip

34:03.379 --> 34:05.230
to awesometimothyfacts.com

34:05.265 --> 34:09.418
because I'm not comfortable with you
seeing our child's father every day at work.

34:09.452 --> 34:12.054
- Like you and Mike?
- Come on, that's different.

34:12.088 --> 34:15.290
Lena, the...

34:15.324 --> 34:19.360
Think about how challenging
everything has been so far.

34:19.395 --> 34:24.232
Do you really wanna open the door to
someone else's involvement in our lives?

34:24.250 --> 34:26.034
The baby's life?

34:27.270 --> 34:31.172
If it means knowing our child's history,

34:31.206 --> 34:33.442
yeah, maybe.

34:33.476 --> 34:37.379
Hi. Just checking. Can
I help with anything?

34:42.118 --> 34:45.253
Excuse me. I'm gonna hit the head.

34:50.493 --> 34:54.429
So, I understand

34:54.464 --> 34:57.132
you're a little concerned
about my sobriety.

34:57.166 --> 35:01.069
- No, I...
- You're worried about your dad.

35:01.104 --> 35:05.273
If I fall off the wagon,
he'll fall off the wagon.

35:05.308 --> 35:09.144
Which leads me to believe
someone saw me out last night.

35:10.179 --> 35:12.014
I know I saw you.

35:14.150 --> 35:17.285
- It was a one-time thing. - I
understand. It was for me, too.

35:17.320 --> 35:21.023
I slipped up. It won't ever happen again.

35:23.393 --> 35:24.493
Are you going to tell him?

35:24.527 --> 35:27.329
Your dad has had a rough time lately.

35:27.363 --> 35:29.264
He doesn't need any bad news.

35:32.335 --> 35:34.302
So I don't see any reason

35:34.337 --> 35:38.240
to tell him about any of this.

35:38.274 --> 35:39.408
Right?

35:45.878 --> 35:48.476
Hey! Thanks for dinner last night.

35:51.517 --> 35:54.419
I am so sorry about that. Oh, my God.

35:54.454 --> 35:57.355
About what? Saying amazing things about me?

35:57.373 --> 35:58.624
No apology necessary.

36:00.426 --> 36:03.295
I just really wanted Stef to
know how much I respect you

36:03.329 --> 36:05.397
and how much I cherish our friendship.

36:05.431 --> 36:07.266
Well, thank you.

36:07.300 --> 36:10.202
And if you're interested in using me as...

36:10.236 --> 36:11.603
you know...

36:11.638 --> 36:14.339
a sperm donor...

36:14.374 --> 36:17.276
I'm in. If you want.

36:17.310 --> 36:21.212
Excuse me. I need to speak with you.

36:43.703 --> 36:47.456
"In his role as the
Gentleman Caller, Chase Dillon

36:47.507 --> 36:50.409
has all the charm and skill of a hat rack.

36:50.443 --> 36:52.511
Though perhaps that is
an insult to hat racks,

36:52.545 --> 36:55.213
which at the very least, have purpose.

36:55.248 --> 36:59.651
His performance is an insult to the
entire concept of live theater itself."

36:59.686 --> 37:02.187
"Also he abuses kittens."

37:05.325 --> 37:08.527
Wow. Honestly, that was much
nicer than I would have been.

37:08.561 --> 37:12.664
How did you do this? Doesn't the paper
have to be approved by, like, a teacher?

37:12.699 --> 37:15.400
Well, I might do the paper's layout,

37:15.435 --> 37:17.336
and I might have made a tweak or two

37:17.370 --> 37:20.539
after our faculty advisor
gave final approval.

37:20.573 --> 37:22.541
What Chase did to you
was a total douche move.

37:22.575 --> 37:24.409
There's no way I was gonna
let him get away with it.

37:24.444 --> 37:28.313
Why? 'Cause I'm your friend?

37:30.650 --> 37:32.484
No, because I was righting a wrong.

37:32.518 --> 37:35.554
Sorry, don't believe you.

37:35.588 --> 37:37.522
I'm like Batman.

37:37.557 --> 37:40.492
We're totally friends.

37:42.261 --> 37:43.595
All right, fine, we're friends,

37:43.629 --> 37:45.330
quit rubbing it in.

37:48.685 --> 37:52.270
Someone got into the
administrative office last night,

37:52.304 --> 37:56.408
and a number of Kindle Paperwhite
e-readers are now missing.

37:56.442 --> 37:58.309
Do you know anything about that?

38:01.330 --> 38:04.516
- Well, it wasn't...
- We know it wasn't you, honey.

38:04.550 --> 38:07.452
During your photo shoot,

38:07.520 --> 38:10.589
you didn't give my keys to anyone, did you?

38:12.425 --> 38:13.492
No.

38:13.526 --> 38:16.595
I gave you the keys to go to the bathroom.

38:18.331 --> 38:19.631
I know your life's not easy right now.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.600
So it's gotta be me, right?
Something goes missing,

38:21.634 --> 38:23.385
it's gotta be the poor
girl with the cornrows?

38:23.436 --> 38:25.470
- That's not fair.
- You called me out here,

38:25.504 --> 38:28.273
made me take three buses across town,
just so you can accuse me of stealing?

38:28.307 --> 38:30.559
They're making me give them a
list of everyone who was there.

38:30.610 --> 38:32.360
I didn't take nothing.

38:32.395 --> 38:34.646
But FYI, you know who
you can put on that list?

38:34.680 --> 38:37.549
- Your boy Brandon.
- No, he wasn't there.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.350
He was he was at my house having dinner.

38:39.368 --> 38:40.719
Well, I saw him lurking
around in the halls.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.454
So unless he can be in
two places at once...

38:42.488 --> 38:44.623
Why didn't you tell me
last night if he was there?

38:44.657 --> 38:46.591
He's your temptation.

38:46.626 --> 38:48.660
And we're supposed to have
each other's back, remember?

38:57.420 --> 39:00.205
- Hey.
- Hey, um...

39:00.223 --> 39:03.575
You didn't come by school during
the photo shoot last night, did you,

39:03.609 --> 39:07.429
- to say hi or something?
- No, I was at the house having dinner.

39:07.480 --> 39:09.681
- Why?
- It's stupid, um,

39:09.715 --> 39:11.600
Daphne said she saw you.

39:11.651 --> 39:14.453
What's wrong?

39:14.487 --> 39:18.290
Some stuff was stolen from the office.

39:18.324 --> 39:20.558
Pretty sure Daphne did it.

39:20.576 --> 39:22.661
- I gotta go.
- Ok.

39:33.456 --> 39:36.208
Um... two things.

39:36.242 --> 39:38.577
First, I know how hard you've
worked to be on this team.

39:38.611 --> 39:42.380
So if I offended you
yesterday, I apologize.

39:44.717 --> 39:47.519
Ok, accepted.

39:49.455 --> 39:50.522
What's the second thing?

40:01.501 --> 40:03.335
What about Lexi?

40:03.369 --> 40:05.270
I don't know.

40:05.304 --> 40:07.305
She's in Honduras.

40:07.340 --> 40:08.707
Who knows when I'll see her again?

40:10.476 --> 40:12.611
Right.

40:12.645 --> 40:15.247
But I don't do cheating.

40:15.281 --> 40:17.449
I know. Me neither.

40:21.654 --> 40:23.455
I think I have to break up with her.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.471
Your cut.

40:41.807 --> 40:44.376
When you were in the office
last night making the IDs,

40:44.410 --> 40:46.278
did you steal some stuff, too?

40:46.312 --> 40:47.512
So what?

40:47.547 --> 40:49.480
Moron.

40:49.498 --> 40:50.749
Now they know someone was in there.

40:50.783 --> 40:52.484
But they don't know it was us, do they?

40:52.518 --> 40:54.619
- No.
- So what's the problem?

40:54.654 --> 40:56.504
Someone's gonna go down for this!

40:56.539 --> 41:00.208
- That's a good thing.
- Ok, whatever you took, put it back.

41:00.259 --> 41:03.595
- Ok, this was not part of the deal.
- All right, Nancy, relax.

41:03.629 --> 41:05.463
I can't just walk in and hand it to them

41:05.497 --> 41:08.600
Just put it back or they'll
find it. Anonymously.

41:08.634 --> 41:10.335
And don't take anything else.

41:18.277 --> 41:19.527
Oh, um...

41:19.562 --> 41:20.712
No... I'll come back.

41:20.746 --> 41:23.515
No, that's fine. What's up?

41:25.351 --> 41:27.485
So last night, um...

41:27.519 --> 41:29.421
I just remembered

41:29.455 --> 41:32.457
I gave Daphne the keys.

41:35.761 --> 41:37.529
Thank you for telling us.

41:37.563 --> 41:41.633
Independent living is

41:41.667 --> 41:43.668
a lot harder than she thought

41:43.703 --> 41:46.338
it was gonna be so...

41:52.244 --> 41:53.561
What do you think?

41:53.596 --> 41:56.247
I like the ones where they're
not looking at the camera.

41:56.282 --> 41:57.482
Yeah, me, too.

42:00.453 --> 42:02.621
I wanna see those.

42:02.655 --> 42:06.257
No, no, no... wait.

42:08.461 --> 42:11.329
- What are you doing?
- I have to zoom in.

42:13.366 --> 42:16.501
- What's that?
- Let me brighten it.

42:19.739 --> 42:21.606
It's Brandon's car.

42:24.377 --> 42:25.577
He was there last night.
