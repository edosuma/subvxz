WEBVTT

00:02.394 --> 00:03.410
You make it look so easy.

00:03.562 --> 00:05.229
Let me try again.
Let me try again.

00:05.247 --> 00:07.080
Remember, keep your eye
on the top of the arc.

00:07.233 --> 00:09.249
Top of the arc. Oh. Gee.

00:09.401 --> 00:10.417
(glass breaks)

00:10.494 --> 00:11.677
Okay, let's forget
the beanbags for now

00:11.904 --> 00:13.595
and just work on
the hand movements.

00:14.573 --> 00:15.756
Yeah, that's it.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.424
Ooh, I'm doing it.

00:17.501 --> 00:18.517
I'm doing it.

00:18.668 --> 00:21.078
(metallic clattering)

00:21.096 --> 00:22.855
I think I should
just put these down.

00:23.673 --> 00:25.691
Oh. What happened in here?

00:25.842 --> 00:27.526
Oh, Oscar's teaching me
how to juggle.

00:27.677 --> 00:29.770
Well, you don't need
a new party trick.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.255
You can already put more grapes
in your mouth

00:31.273 --> 00:32.439
than anyone I know.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.107
Yeah, but not all parties
have grapes,

00:34.201 --> 00:35.850
and I'm not as good
with baby carrots.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.352
Yeah, I can't help you
with that one,

00:37.446 --> 00:38.762
but I am about to make your day.

00:38.781 --> 00:40.113
You know how every Thursday,

00:40.207 --> 00:42.115
you make me watch the
evening news with you at 6:00?

00:42.209 --> 00:44.434
I like us to stay informed
about our community.

00:44.453 --> 00:46.027
And you have a thing
for Dale Dixon.

00:46.047 --> 00:48.547
You mean that anchor guy
who used to smile all the time,

00:48.698 --> 00:51.233
even during national disasters?
Interesting.

00:51.293 --> 00:53.201
I don't have a thing for him.

00:53.295 --> 00:54.444
Although, when I was eight,

00:54.463 --> 00:56.446
I did start
a Dale Dixon fan club.

00:56.540 --> 00:59.116
I've still got the bylaws
in my bra drawer.

00:59.134 --> 01:01.209
Didn't he retire? Or die?

01:01.228 --> 01:02.786
Nope, he still does
a segment called

01:02.805 --> 01:05.455
"The Local Spotlight with Dale"
that Kat never misses.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.232
And sometimes
he covers breaking news

01:07.459 --> 01:09.217
when a strong, steady hand
is required.

01:09.236 --> 01:14.464
Anyway, I submitted the café
to be featured, and guess what.

01:14.633 --> 01:15.982
Don't you dare tease me, Randi.

01:16.135 --> 01:18.135
I'm not! We got picked!

01:18.228 --> 01:20.079
What?! So Dale Dixon--

01:20.306 --> 01:22.247
the Dale Dixon--
he's gonna be here,

01:22.474 --> 01:23.807
in my café, talking to my face?

01:23.826 --> 01:26.401
-And yours, if there's time?
-This is so awesome.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.735
My girlfriend's gonna be
on the news,

01:27.755 --> 01:29.630
and not for stealing a car.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.257
I had a bad-girl phase.

01:32.409 --> 01:33.834
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:34.002 --> 01:35.594
Randi, you are the best!

01:35.821 --> 01:38.913
Well, I need you to keep that
in mind while I tell you this.

01:38.933 --> 01:42.175
I found an apartment,
and I'm moving out in two weeks.

01:42.328 --> 01:43.268
Oh!

01:43.495 --> 01:44.937
Wow! Wow.

01:45.088 --> 01:46.105
Knew it was coming.

01:46.332 --> 01:47.922
Still feeling it
a little bit in my chest.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.942
You know that super cute,
lavender four-plex

01:50.169 --> 01:51.351
on Fifth and Grand?

01:51.503 --> 01:52.519
Ooh, that's a great building.

01:52.671 --> 01:54.020
Delivery in the back,
short staircase.

01:54.115 --> 01:55.672
And they just renovated it.

01:55.765 --> 01:58.024
All new fixtures,
appliances, skylights,

01:58.119 --> 02:01.436
which I'm going to get
because I scored the top floor.

02:01.530 --> 02:03.438
Nobody's gonna be stomping
on my head

02:03.457 --> 02:05.866
because I'm gonna be stomping
on theirs!

02:05.960 --> 02:08.518
Wow. Who else is
gonna do Tuesday night

02:08.520 --> 02:10.370
<i> Property Brothers</i>
and popcorn with me?

02:10.464 --> 02:12.706
I'll do it. I love popcorn
and home renovation.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.617
Yeah, but I can't debate which
Prop Bro is hotter with you.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.785
-BOTH: It's Jonathan.
-It's obviously Drew!

02:17.954 --> 02:20.030
Okay, so my competition
is Dale Dixon

02:20.048 --> 02:21.289
and the Property Brothers.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.975
Anyone else I should know about?

02:23.202 --> 02:24.534
Um, mm, McGruff the Crime Dog,

02:24.628 --> 02:26.294
but I haven't seen him
in a few years,

02:26.313 --> 02:28.313
so I don't know
if the feelings are still there.

02:28.540 --> 02:31.375
Wait. You Kat,
who owns a cat café,

02:31.468 --> 02:32.893
had a crush on a fictitious dog?

02:32.987 --> 02:36.062
I was young and dumb, and he had
a really cool trench coat.

02:36.215 --> 02:37.898
Uh-huh. I got a trench coat.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.716
Do you?

02:39.851 --> 02:40.642
(barks)

02:40.736 --> 02:42.644
-(clicks tongue)
-(barks)

02:42.663 --> 02:44.413
I'm-a start packing right now.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.814
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

02:46.834 --> 02:49.651
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

02:49.670 --> 02:52.062
The segment producer
will be here any minute

02:52.080 --> 02:53.172
for the preinterview.

02:53.399 --> 02:55.081
That explains
the cleaning frenzy.

02:55.234 --> 02:57.417
I just want everything
to be perfect for Dale.

02:57.569 --> 03:01.162
I-I mean, Mr. Dixon. I want<i> him</i>
to tell me to call him "Dale."

03:01.256 --> 03:02.923
I just want to be
in his presence.

03:03.017 --> 03:06.852
I bet he smells like
a new saddle and hope.

03:07.003 --> 03:09.246
Ooh, wait.
You're into this guy, too?

03:09.339 --> 03:12.507
Did you not see last year's
Thanksgiving parade?

03:12.601 --> 03:16.695
No one rides a giant turkey
like that man.

03:17.923 --> 03:19.514
-You know, I met him once.
-What?

03:19.533 --> 03:22.259
Well, we were both in line
for a drink

03:22.352 --> 03:26.038
at a charity event,
and he winked at me.

03:26.932 --> 03:28.432
That's it?

03:28.450 --> 03:29.541
It was the '80s.

03:29.768 --> 03:32.285
A wink was more powerful
back then.

03:32.438 --> 03:34.955
Do you think
there'll be a makeup person

03:35.107 --> 03:36.122
or should I come camera-ready?

03:36.275 --> 03:37.274
(scoffs) What am I saying?

03:37.292 --> 03:39.292
I'm always camera-ready.
(laughs)

03:39.386 --> 03:41.945
Maybe you could help Katharine
in that department.

03:42.038 --> 03:43.964
Introduce her
to a matte foundation.

03:44.116 --> 03:45.057
Mother!

03:45.133 --> 03:47.041
I'm kidding, sweetheart.

03:47.061 --> 03:49.102
And some bronzer.

03:50.138 --> 03:51.788
Dale Dixon in this café?

03:51.807 --> 03:53.732
-I just-- I can't believe it.
-I can't, either.

03:53.883 --> 03:57.461
I mean, this place is cute,
but is it newsworthy?

03:57.554 --> 03:59.646
It's not like you're saving
the world or anything.

03:59.798 --> 04:03.149
No, but I'm saving cats
and making people happy.

04:03.244 --> 04:06.119
Exactly. Why am I tuning in?

04:07.656 --> 04:09.081
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:09.232 --> 04:12.066
I'm here for the preinterview.
I'm looking for Kat Silver.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.827
She's right here.

04:13.979 --> 04:17.814
But picture this
with a matte foundation.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.332
Mother,
why don't you go upstairs

04:19.485 --> 04:21.075
and find things you hate
in my closet.

04:21.169 --> 04:24.930
It's not as much fun with
permission, but I'll do it.

04:25.081 --> 04:27.081
Sorry about that. Hi. I'm Kat.

04:27.101 --> 04:28.992
-Olivia.
-Uh, would you like

04:29.085 --> 04:29.935
some coffee, a pastry?

04:30.162 --> 04:31.436
Maybe you'd like to hold a cat.

04:31.663 --> 04:33.663
Pounce De Leon is currently
our best snuggler.

04:33.757 --> 04:36.775
No, thanks. I'm just here
to check the lighting

04:36.926 --> 04:38.926
-and make sure you're not nuts.
-And?

04:39.021 --> 04:42.839
So far, the lighting is good,
and I'm gonna call you "quirky."

04:42.841 --> 04:44.174
Well, don't tell that to Dale.

04:44.267 --> 04:45.842
We want him to form
his own opinions. (chuckles)

04:46.011 --> 04:48.011
We'll be here to set up about
an hour before the interview.

04:48.104 --> 04:51.773
It is live, so no surprises,
no swearing, no hugging Dale.

04:51.867 --> 04:53.350
-What if he hugs me?
-He won't.

04:53.368 --> 04:54.851
-He might.
-He won't.

04:54.986 --> 04:56.353
We'll see.

04:56.355 --> 04:58.130
(sneezes)
Whew! Excuse me.

04:58.281 --> 05:00.782
-Are you sick?
-No.

05:00.950 --> 05:02.208
Because Dale doesn't do
sick people.

05:02.361 --> 05:04.452
I'm fine. I'm never sick.

05:04.621 --> 05:06.379
Perfect attendance
all through school.

05:06.548 --> 05:08.640
All right, I did miss one day
in seventh grade,

05:08.867 --> 05:10.033
but not because I was sick.

05:10.126 --> 05:12.869
I just hadn't gotten
the hang of my period yet.

05:12.962 --> 05:14.146
Don't tell Dale.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.575
There's central air,
laundry in the unit

05:18.577 --> 05:21.987
and a working garbage disposal.
Strong, too.

05:22.214 --> 05:24.564
The kind that'd turn your hand
into a bloody meat stump

05:24.716 --> 05:25.899
if you're not careful.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.643
How did you end up landing
such a great place?

05:28.720 --> 05:30.495
Oh, I have been on it.
I've been checking the websites,

05:30.647 --> 05:32.831
checking the apps,
and when this place popped up,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.391
I was the first one there.

05:34.409 --> 05:36.743
Well, the second,
but I convinced that guy

05:36.895 --> 05:38.486
to go back home to his wife.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.081
So I got the apartment and an
invite to an anniversary party.

05:41.233 --> 05:42.415
-(laughs)
-You hear that?

05:42.568 --> 05:44.568
Hey, she been working for it,
and it paid off.

05:44.661 --> 05:46.845
Now she won't be sleeping
on her friend's couch.

05:47.072 --> 05:48.363
I've been working for it.

05:48.423 --> 05:50.349
Flipping through
apartment listings on the can

05:50.500 --> 05:51.575
does not count.

05:51.668 --> 05:52.684
(laughs)

05:52.853 --> 05:54.928
You know I'm too regular
to finish a crossword.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.171
I wish I didn't.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.173
But I am kind of inspired.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.084
Maybe I should put
more work into it.

06:01.177 --> 06:02.752
Hey, you can't put less.

06:02.846 --> 06:04.679
Well, I have to warn you,
it's rough out there.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.606
If you start looking now,
you might find a place

06:06.758 --> 06:07.941
by, like, next year.

06:08.093 --> 06:10.685
You hear how she said,
"Start now"? (chuckles)

06:10.704 --> 06:12.037
Start now.

06:13.765 --> 06:15.448
All right, you guys,
I got to get back to work.

06:15.601 --> 06:17.617
Kat asked us to deep-clean
the litter box room

06:17.769 --> 06:20.286
before the interview,
and Phil should be done by now.

06:21.123 --> 06:23.106
It's really nice of you
to nominate the café.

06:23.125 --> 06:24.216
CARTER:
It's so nice.

06:24.367 --> 06:25.942
You know what else
would've been nice?

06:25.961 --> 06:27.219
If you would've nominated
your boyfriend's business.

06:27.446 --> 06:29.295
Oh, well,
that wouldn't be possible

06:29.390 --> 06:31.281
because
I don't have a boyfriend.

06:31.299 --> 06:33.116
Not the point of that statement.

06:34.119 --> 06:37.145
I'm her man.
She just don't know it yet.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.642
I don't want to brag, but
I already got three apartments

06:42.736 --> 06:44.552
lined up to go see.
Any tips?

06:44.646 --> 06:47.889
Uh, never trust the photos,
always look in the closets--

06:47.908 --> 06:49.482
ooh, and if there's
a weird smell,

06:49.635 --> 06:51.818
it's never gonna go away,
even with a deep clean.

06:51.970 --> 06:54.579
So it's like online dating.
Got it.

06:54.731 --> 06:57.307
Hey, uh, is it hot in here?

06:57.400 --> 06:58.992
Did either of you touch
the thermostat?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.994
Ooh, no way. I do not want
another team meeting

07:01.146 --> 07:02.312
on a Saturday night.

07:02.330 --> 07:04.238
Honey, you don't look so good.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.499
-Hurtful.
-You feeling okay?

07:06.668 --> 07:09.669
-I feel fine.
-Oh, no, no, no.
You have a fever.

07:09.821 --> 07:10.929
Uh-oh.

07:11.006 --> 07:12.914
Why don't you go take a nap.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.081
You might be getting sick.

07:14.217 --> 07:15.934
Oh, no, I am not sick.
I can't be sick.

07:16.161 --> 07:17.661
Dale Dixon comes in two days.

07:17.754 --> 07:21.106
(loud, honking nose-blowing)

07:22.000 --> 07:23.683
You know, maybe I will
take a nap,

07:23.777 --> 07:26.002
'cause I have the chills,
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

07:26.171 --> 07:27.837
But that doesn't mean I'm sick.

07:27.856 --> 07:30.031
I felt the same way
when Beth died in<i> Little Women.</i>

07:31.768 --> 07:33.618
Have you two ever dealt
with a sick Kat before?

07:33.770 --> 07:35.269
-No.
-She never gets sick.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.696
Back in college,
she got the flu,

07:36.790 --> 07:39.048
and when I brought her soup,
she threw a matzo ball at me

07:39.108 --> 07:40.959
and said my ears are too small
for my face.

07:41.110 --> 07:42.276
That doesn't sound like Kat.

07:42.370 --> 07:44.354
Oh, she's not Kat
when she's sick.

07:44.372 --> 07:47.757
She's a frightening monster
known as "Katzilla."

07:49.470 --> 07:50.802
Stop staring at my ears.

07:51.029 --> 07:53.096
They're perfect.
I had them measured.

07:59.462 --> 08:02.463
♪<i> Putting my bed away,</i>
<i> having some fun</i> ♪

08:02.557 --> 08:05.150
♪<i> Starting my day today,</i>
<i> now I...</i> ♪

08:05.301 --> 08:07.694
Oh, my God.
I'm turning into Kat.

08:09.214 --> 08:10.655
Kat, how you doing in there?

08:10.882 --> 08:12.549
You okay?
I'm gonna head downstairs.

08:12.567 --> 08:14.993
KAT (nasally):
No, wait.
I'm gonna come with you.

08:15.220 --> 08:17.329
Wait. Ooh. Uh, no. No, no, no.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.739
You need to get your rest. You
have your interview tomorrow.

08:19.891 --> 08:22.575
-You can't tell me what to do.
-Oh, fine. Sorry. Don't rest.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.395
I need to rest. I'm sick.
What kind of friend are you?!

08:25.413 --> 08:27.488
Okay, I'm gonna let you
fight this out with yourself.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.174
Let me know
if you need anything.

08:29.401 --> 08:31.968
-I don't need anything!
-All right.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.515
Randi, I need things!

08:36.666 --> 08:38.975
Randi,
I need things.

08:39.761 --> 08:41.394
Randi?

08:42.080 --> 08:44.414
All right. Yummy.

08:44.432 --> 08:46.608
Here you go.

08:48.103 --> 08:50.103
It's not hot enough.

08:50.255 --> 08:51.512
There's steam coming off of it.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.848
Is that chicken?
I didn't want chicken.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.441
But you asked
for chicken noodle soup.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.369
It's too soupy.

08:58.263 --> 08:59.854
So let me get this straight.

08:59.948 --> 09:02.207
You want some non-chickeny,
non-soupy, chicken noodle soup?

09:02.358 --> 09:05.418
Yes. Is that so hard?

09:07.548 --> 09:08.955
Hey, you.

09:09.198 --> 09:12.959
I brought you a little cuddle
buddy to help you feel better.

09:13.111 --> 09:14.961
I don't like cats anymore.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.947
This particular cat or all cats?

09:17.966 --> 09:19.373
Get that creature out of here!

09:19.393 --> 09:20.617
Okay, okay.

09:20.635 --> 09:23.094
We're not gonna tell the others
about this.

09:23.321 --> 09:25.730
Go tell 'em! Tell 'em all!

09:27.475 --> 09:30.627
KAT:
Okay, Kat, you got 24 hours.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.553
Get better! Get better!

09:32.573 --> 09:34.406
Do it for Dale!

09:34.557 --> 09:36.908
(sighs, pants)

09:37.060 --> 09:39.393
Ooh. Yeah, your mom was right.

09:39.487 --> 09:41.413
You're gonna need
a little bronzer.

09:45.310 --> 09:47.310
Oh, you're back.
How'd it go?

09:47.329 --> 09:49.312
Just saw the greatest apartment.

09:49.331 --> 09:50.922
Oh, awesome!
Hey, when you moving?

09:50.999 --> 09:52.315
Can I help you pack?

09:52.334 --> 09:54.167
You didn't let me finish.

09:54.319 --> 09:56.169
It's a two-bedroom,
and I can't afford it.

09:56.321 --> 09:58.004
All right. Hey, we can fix that.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.515
Uh, anybody want
to live with him?!

10:01.250 --> 10:02.767
Am I really that bad?

10:02.919 --> 10:04.494
(sighs)
You know I love you, man,

10:04.512 --> 10:06.346
but we work together,
we live together,

10:06.498 --> 10:08.498
and this morning, we almost
took a shower together.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.999
I really didn't know
you were in there.

10:10.093 --> 10:12.426
The water was running,
and I was singing.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.279
I thought you were the radio.

10:14.430 --> 10:16.531
Oh, thanks, man.

10:17.767 --> 10:19.525
(knocking)

10:20.362 --> 10:22.603
Morning, sweetie.
How you feeling?

10:22.697 --> 10:23.955
What are you doing here?

10:24.107 --> 10:25.198
I heard my queen was
feeling under the weather,

10:25.350 --> 10:26.791
so brought you some flowers.

10:26.943 --> 10:30.111
Bet these were happy before you
brought 'em here to die. Thanks.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.781
-(chuckles) I heard about this.
-Heard about what?

10:33.875 --> 10:35.375
Just that you can be a little
prickly when you're sick.

10:35.527 --> 10:38.285
Who'd you hear that from?
Randi? Max? My mother?

10:38.305 --> 10:41.381
-I'm not telling.
-Then you're on my list, too.

10:41.475 --> 10:42.790
What are you doing?

10:42.809 --> 10:45.385
I'm getting out of bed.
I got my interview today.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.704
-You didn't cancel?
-Cancel on Dale Dixon?

10:47.797 --> 10:49.539
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard in my life!

10:49.557 --> 10:51.207
-Kat, you have to. You're sick.
-No, no, no.

10:51.226 --> 10:52.558
I'm feeling much better. Watch.

10:52.711 --> 10:55.153
You want to see
how many jumping jacks I can do?

10:57.065 --> 10:58.490
Et cetera, et cetera.

10:58.641 --> 10:59.974
I'm gonna sit down.

11:00.735 --> 11:03.144
What can I do? Can I get you
some tea, some juice?

11:03.221 --> 11:04.412
Stay away from me!

11:05.724 --> 11:08.708
I'm gonna grab some holy water
just to be safe.

11:10.896 --> 11:12.653
So tell me a little
about yourself.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.898
Well, I've been told
that I'm a pretty good roommate.

11:14.900 --> 11:17.992
I'm tidy. I-I like to cook.
I play the guitar.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.419
Oh, hey, me, too.

11:19.571 --> 11:20.420
Oh, nice.

11:20.514 --> 11:23.164
Does my bedroom
have a solid lock?

11:23.258 --> 11:25.425
Oh. Uh, I-I don't know.

11:25.577 --> 11:26.834
Well, no worries.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.354
Do you think there's room
for an industrial freezer?

11:29.505 --> 11:32.582
My daughter thinks
I'm too old to live alone,

11:32.675 --> 11:35.360
and this is cheaper
than assisted living.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.346
You may have to help me
out of the tub.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.442
This is Bert. That's Ernie.

11:42.536 --> 11:45.019
I've got more,
but they don't like strangers

11:45.038 --> 11:46.946
so I didn't bring 'em.

11:47.098 --> 11:48.707
How many more?

11:48.858 --> 11:51.292
How many would be too many?

11:54.864 --> 11:55.955
Hello.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.623
I came to check on Katharine.
How's it going?

11:57.700 --> 12:00.534
I offered her a cough drop,
and she took a swing at me.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.536
Classic.
When she got the chicken pox,

12:02.614 --> 12:04.723
her father and I almost
put her up for adoption.

12:04.874 --> 12:08.643
I just don't know why
my ears are making her so angry.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.646
Oh, I see why.

12:13.141 --> 12:15.641
More importantly, why is there
a news van parked outside?

12:15.736 --> 12:18.886
Surely she isn't doing
the interview if she's sick.

12:18.980 --> 12:20.554
She wouldn't cancel,

12:20.574 --> 12:22.482
but I talked to Randi and Phil,
and they're gonna do it.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.151
She's gonna be so bummed, but
she can barely lift her head.

12:25.303 --> 12:29.164
Clearly this calls for
a mother's touch.

12:29.991 --> 12:31.474
Oh, she's in her room.

12:31.567 --> 12:34.644
Yes, and I'm going
to do the interview.

12:34.662 --> 12:36.755
What did you think I meant?

12:42.654 --> 12:44.988
Sheila, are you sure
that you don't want

12:45.006 --> 12:47.340
Randi or me
to talk about the café?

12:47.492 --> 12:49.325
You know, 'cause we work here.

12:49.344 --> 12:51.327
I-I think
I'm the one with the gravitas

12:51.346 --> 12:52.829
to really get the points across.

12:52.998 --> 12:54.939
It's just that Kat laid out
all the important areas

12:55.091 --> 12:56.107
that she wanted to hit.

12:56.334 --> 12:57.333
I know what to say.

12:57.426 --> 12:58.684
I've had opinions
about this place

12:58.853 --> 13:00.336
since the day
Katharine opened it.

13:00.429 --> 13:02.614
Yeah, I think
that's our concern.

13:02.841 --> 13:04.949
All right, people,
we roll in five.

13:05.176 --> 13:06.692
Can we get you on the couch?

13:07.529 --> 13:10.847
Bring me up to speed.
Where are we and why do I care?

13:10.865 --> 13:14.709
It's a cat café, and
why you care is in the notes.

13:16.187 --> 13:17.796
Hello, all.

13:18.023 --> 13:20.614
Couldn't be more thrilled
to be here.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.449
Well, it's so nice to meet you.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.635
I'm Phil Crumpler.

13:23.711 --> 13:25.136
Is there any way that you could

13:25.363 --> 13:28.031
record a birthday greeting
for my mama?

13:28.124 --> 13:29.623
I'd have to charge you $30.

13:29.717 --> 13:32.727
I brought the cash
just for that reason.

13:34.039 --> 13:35.296
Hi. I'm Randi,

13:35.373 --> 13:36.815
and you can charge him way more
if you wanted to.

13:37.042 --> 13:39.967
Hi. Sheila Silver,
Katharine's mother.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.545
It is very nice to meet you.

13:42.564 --> 13:44.138
Oh, we've met before.

13:44.232 --> 13:47.066
We shared a steamy glance
in 1981.

13:47.218 --> 13:48.309
Well, I don't remember,

13:48.328 --> 13:50.161
but I'm gonna say
we haven't changed a bit.

13:50.388 --> 13:51.645
(both laugh)

13:51.665 --> 13:54.165
I hope you're the one
I'll be interviewing today.

13:54.317 --> 13:55.333
Oh, I am.

13:55.484 --> 13:57.669
And I promise
to be memorable this time

13:57.820 --> 14:00.004
if you promise not to forget.

14:00.156 --> 14:02.656
-Oh, this is gonna be fun.
-(laughs)

14:02.734 --> 14:06.493
Will you excuse me while
I prepare my mouth to say words?

14:06.513 --> 14:07.995
Of course.

14:08.164 --> 14:11.074
Potato, tomato, potato, tomato.

14:11.167 --> 14:14.352
He is such a professional!

14:14.503 --> 14:15.928
Sheila, if you're really
gonna do this,

14:16.081 --> 14:18.431
are you sure you don't want
to look at Kat's talking points?

14:18.583 --> 14:21.008
Why? You drink coffee,
you pet a cat.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.919
It's not a tour of the Louvre.

14:22.937 --> 14:24.529
Oh, Lord.

14:26.182 --> 14:27.440
You let me oversleep!

14:27.592 --> 14:29.016
Is Dale here?
I got to get ready.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.851
Oh, no, you don't.
Your mom's doing the interview.

14:30.945 --> 14:32.203
My mother? No!
That can't happen.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.188
-It'll be fine.
-No, it won't!

14:34.207 --> 14:35.781
She thinks
what I'm doing here is cute.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.691
-Get out of my way.
Get out of...
-No. No.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.752
Oh, there.

14:41.864 --> 14:42.714
(grunting)

14:42.865 --> 14:43.940
Just-- No.

14:44.033 --> 14:45.633
(grunting)

14:46.961 --> 14:49.345
That wasn't fair.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.561
(snoring)

14:58.565 --> 15:02.625
So if you're in the area,
swing by Kat's Cat Café,

15:02.718 --> 15:06.479
where the coffee comes hot,
and the cats come cute.

15:06.631 --> 15:08.072
(strained sigh)

15:08.967 --> 15:10.700
And we're out.

15:11.970 --> 15:14.470
-You were wonderful.
-Thank you.

15:14.563 --> 15:16.139
Maybe we could grab
a drink sometime.

15:16.157 --> 15:17.323
I'd like that.

15:17.475 --> 15:19.475
-How about now?
-Dale, we got to go.

15:19.568 --> 15:21.402
There's a big fire
over on Fifth and Grand.

15:21.496 --> 15:23.588
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wait. Did you just
say "Fifth and Grand"?

15:23.739 --> 15:26.482
Apparently, it started
in a newly-renovated four-plex.

15:26.501 --> 15:29.168
-Is it lavender?
-Not anymore.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.653
(crying):
Oh, no!

15:30.746 --> 15:33.339
Oh, so sorry, sweetie. Oh.

15:33.491 --> 15:34.507
Dale, let's go.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.936
-Rain check?
-Or more correctly, fire check.

15:38.163 --> 15:41.064
You are a pistol! (laughs)

15:42.667 --> 15:44.525
Still got it.

15:46.095 --> 15:49.672
♪<i> Putting my bed away,</i>
<i> it's such a chore</i> ♪

15:49.691 --> 15:54.077
♪<i> What if I'm here to stay</i>
<i> forevermore?</i> ♪

15:54.955 --> 15:57.121
Hey, uh, Kat still sleeping?

15:57.273 --> 15:59.015
Yeah, going on 14 hours now.

15:59.033 --> 16:00.516
Wow. Should we be worried?

16:00.535 --> 16:01.793
No, we should be glad.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.921
Maybe we'll get lucky
and she'll sleep for another 14.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.206
Ooh, don't make
any sudden movements.

16:07.358 --> 16:08.524
Don't look her in the eye.

16:08.543 --> 16:10.284
Good morning.

16:10.378 --> 16:13.137
Be careful.
It might be a trick.

16:13.364 --> 16:16.290
Hey, girl. How you feeling?

16:16.309 --> 16:18.309
Better. I think my fever broke.

16:18.536 --> 16:20.812
Last few days are
kind of a haze.

16:20.963 --> 16:22.296
I hope I wasn't
too much of a pain.

16:22.390 --> 16:24.816
You were no trouble at all.

16:25.043 --> 16:26.133
Aces.

16:26.211 --> 16:28.878
So, how bad was the interview?

16:28.896 --> 16:30.730
Did my mother
even mention the café,

16:30.824 --> 16:32.898
or did she just talk
about herself?

16:33.051 --> 16:34.884
I think you should watch it.

16:34.886 --> 16:35.976
It was that bad?

16:36.070 --> 16:37.662
Let me show you.

16:38.740 --> 16:41.833
Sheila, what makes this place
so special?

16:42.060 --> 16:44.151
Well, aside from the cats

16:44.245 --> 16:46.987
and the warm atmosphere,

16:47.081 --> 16:48.898
I'd say my daughter Katharine

16:48.991 --> 16:51.658
is the most special thing
about the café.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.160
How so?

16:53.179 --> 16:55.071
She's the heart of the place.

16:55.164 --> 16:57.256
You can really feel
how much she cares about

16:57.350 --> 17:01.168
the people she serves
and the cats she saves.

17:01.246 --> 17:03.837
So, animal rescue
is important to her?

17:03.857 --> 17:05.915
It's a true passion.

17:05.933 --> 17:09.252
And I'm proud of her
for pursuing it.

17:09.270 --> 17:11.678
She's making a real difference.

17:11.773 --> 17:15.107
And she couldn't do it without
these two wonderful people.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.943
Oh. Well, do either of you
have anything to add?

17:18.038 --> 17:20.371
I just love you, Dale.

17:20.598 --> 17:23.524
I'd like to say that Kat loves
this community, and I'm sure

17:23.543 --> 17:25.359
she would want me to mention
the piano bar next door.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.286
It's called The Middle C,
and it's owned

17:27.380 --> 17:29.589
by my boyfriend Carter Cook.

17:32.293 --> 17:33.776
-(blows nose)
-You still stuffy?

17:33.795 --> 17:36.796
No, that was happy blowing.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.614
My mother said
something nice about me.

17:38.707 --> 17:41.284
I'm kind of glad I didn't get
to meet Dale Dixon.

17:41.377 --> 17:43.119
I would have missed this.

17:43.121 --> 17:45.454
He's way shorter
than we thought.

17:45.623 --> 17:48.549
And by the way, Randi,
"boyfriend"?

17:48.643 --> 17:50.551
I thought it was time.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.295
Anything else happen
while I was sick?

17:52.463 --> 17:54.980
Is Elon Musk the mayor of Mars?

17:55.075 --> 17:58.392
Well, my new apartment building
burned down.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.410
What?

17:59.562 --> 18:01.079
Yeah, thank God
no one moved in yet.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.806
But I'm gonna need to stay
on your couch a little longer.

18:03.808 --> 18:05.474
Well, this is not a bad thing.

18:05.493 --> 18:08.586
We still have 275 episodes of
the<i> Property Brothers</i> to watch.

18:08.737 --> 18:10.904
-(chuckles)
-(sneezes)

18:10.998 --> 18:12.924
Oh, no. Are you getting sick?

18:13.075 --> 18:15.000
Get out
before you give it back to her!

18:15.095 --> 18:16.485
-No, I don't think I'm...
-Get out.

18:16.504 --> 18:18.721
-I really don't think...
-Get out!

18:19.991 --> 18:21.557
Oh.

18:24.011 --> 18:25.561
So, pizza tonight?

18:31.185 --> 18:33.369
<i> RANDI:</i>
<i> ...my boyfriend Carter Cook.</i>

18:33.504 --> 18:35.429
<i> ...my boyfriend Carter Cook.</i>
<i> ...my boyfriend Carter Cook.</i>

18:35.448 --> 18:38.098
-Will you stop with that?
-He's been doing it all day.

18:38.267 --> 18:39.617
I made it my ringtone.

18:39.768 --> 18:42.011
Maybe I should make
you saying nice things

18:42.104 --> 18:43.346
about me my ringtone.

18:43.364 --> 18:45.181
Oh, don't make me regret it.

18:45.199 --> 18:47.683
How come you never say things
like that to my face?

18:47.776 --> 18:50.777
Darling, if you compliment
your children too much,

18:50.797 --> 18:51.963
they stop trying.

18:52.190 --> 18:53.798
When have I ever stopped trying?

18:53.967 --> 18:55.191
Exactly.

18:55.284 --> 18:56.968
Well, is she this needy
with you?

18:57.119 --> 18:59.211
I'm just here to drink.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.213
Max, how's the roommate
search going?

19:01.366 --> 19:02.974
Not great. I didn't realize

19:03.125 --> 19:05.309
how many people make porn
in their own homes.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.219
I'm gonna have
to give up the apartment.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.538
Ouch. I know what
that feels like. I'm sorry.

19:09.557 --> 19:11.482
You know, I think you need to
give lizard lady another chance.

19:11.634 --> 19:14.635
I called her.
It's a hundred lizards.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.487
She has 100 lizards.

19:17.732 --> 19:21.884
You know, you have a two-bedroom
apartment you can't afford.

19:21.977 --> 19:23.161
And you've been living

19:23.388 --> 19:25.663
on my daughter's couch
like a vagabond.

19:28.393 --> 19:30.059
Should we?

19:30.152 --> 19:31.243
I would love to have a closet.

19:31.396 --> 19:33.337
One of the bedrooms has two.

19:33.564 --> 19:36.490
You mean,<i> my</i> bedroom has two?

19:36.567 --> 19:38.176
All right, roomie.

19:38.403 --> 19:40.511
-All right!
-Wait, wait, wait.

19:40.663 --> 19:42.346
I don't know about this.

19:42.498 --> 19:44.407
My-my superhot
official girlfriend

19:44.500 --> 19:46.258
living with
my superhot best friend?

19:46.352 --> 19:47.852
See? We've been together
five minutes,

19:48.079 --> 19:49.002
and you already trippin'.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.579
(laughs)

19:50.598 --> 19:52.506
Wow. Two of my favorite people
are gonna be living together.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.250
Well, two of my favorite people
that I know.

19:54.268 --> 19:57.603
Otherwise, I'd have to include
Oprah and McGruff the Crime Dog.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.031
When I was sick, I watched
some of his YouTube videos.

20:00.182 --> 20:01.607
McGruff's still got it.
